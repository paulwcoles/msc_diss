AND HER WOUNDS ARE INFECTED CAN SHE BE SAVED 
IT'S SO HORRIBLE 
THAT THIS POOR ANIMAL IS QUITE LITERALLY BEING EATEN ALIVE 
KEEPER STUART JONES COMES FACE TO FACE WITH HIS RHINOS 
AND SO DOES OUR VERY FIRST ROAR RANGER 
AMAZING 
AND THE TIGERS' MISSION SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT 
IS TO CLIMB UP THIS POLE BUT WILL THEY GO FOR IT 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO ROAR I'M RANI AND I'M MATT 
AND WE'RE WITH THE LARGEST BIRD IN THE WORLD 
YES IT'S THE OSTRICH 
NOT ONLY THE LARGEST BUT ALSO THE TALLEST AND THE FASTEST 
THAT'S RIGHT THEY CAN RUN UP TO FIFTY KILOMETRES AN HOUR 
AND THEY NEED TO BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE BIRDS THEY CAN'T FLY 
WE'VE GOT LOADS MORE GREAT FACTS FOR YOU ON TODAY'S SHOW 
BARBARY LIONS HAVE DIED OUT IN THE WILD COMPLETELY 
SO THEY'RE INCREDIBLY RARE 
LITTLE PRIDES IN CAPTIVITY THEREFORE ARE VITAL 
TO THE SURVIVAL OF THEIR SPECIES 
AND ANY BABIES BORN ARE VERY PRECIOUS 
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THE KEEPERS WERE THRILLED 
WHEN LIONESS SAFFYIA GAVE BIRTH TO A FIRST CUB 
A PERFECT LITTLE FEMALE CALLED SAMIRA 
BUT THEN DISASTER STRUCK 
MUM PICKED HER UP BY THE SCRUFF OF HER NECK 
JUST LIKE ANY CAT MOVING A KITTEN 
BUT ACCIDENTALLY SANK HER TEETH INTO SAMIRA SO DEEPLY 
THAT SHE NEARLY DIED AND WAS LEFT PERMANENTLY DISABLED 
HER DEDICATED KEEPERS DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD 
EVEN TAKING HER SWIMMING TO BUILD UP HER MUSCLES 
EVERYONE ADORED THE PLUCKY LITTLE LIONESS 
AND HAVING BEATEN THE ODDS BY SURVIVING THIS FAR 
THEY WERE DETERMINED THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE 
THE BEST QUALITY OF LIFE POSSIBLE 
BUT DESPITE ALL THEIR EFFORTS SHE STILL HAS A VERY HEAVY LIMP 
AND SADLY SHE HAS NOW SUFFERED ANOTHER SERIOUS INJURY 
SHE SHARES HER ENCLOSURE WITH TWO OF HER YOUNGER BROTHERS 
MILO AND MOONLIGHT BUT SOMETIMES SHE DOESN'T GET ON WITH THEM 
RECENTLY MILO HAS BEEN PICKING ON HER 
GIVING HER NASTY BITES AND SCRATCHES 
KEEPER CHRIS HALES HAS COME TO SEE HOW SHE IS 
SAMIRA HERE SHE'S ACTUALLY HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A FIGHT 
AND SHE'S GOT A COUPLE OF INJURIES ON HER BACK END 
JUST IN FRONT OF HER LEGS THERE SHE'S GOT A COUPLE OF BITE WOUNDS 
EITHER SIDE OF HER WE NOTICED IT ABOUT FIVE DAYS BACK NOW 
IT DIDN'T LOOK TOO BAD IT WAS OOZING A LITTLE BIT 
IT PROBABLY LOOKED A LOT WORSE THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS 
SO WE CALLED THE VET IN ANYWAY SHE WAS PUT ON A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS 
WHICH SHOULD HAVE KICKED IN WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AT THE LATEST 
YOU KNOW SORT OF TWO DAYS 
BUT THE WOUNDS AREN'T HEALING 
AND SAMIRA'S FINDING IT REALLY HARD TO KEEP THEM CLEAN 
MOST ANIMALS AS SOON AS THEY GET AN INJURY 
THEY LICK IT IT'S THE SAME WITH US 
IF YOU BURN YOUR HANDS OR GET A CUT REALLY 
YOU PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH COS THE SALIVA MAKES IT FEEL BETTER 
IT'S THE SAME WITH THESE AND IT HELPS TO CLEAN IT OUT 
BECAUSE SHE'S HAVING DIFFICULTIES MOVING AROUND 
SHE CAN'T KEEP IT CLEAN SHE INITIALLY STARTED LICKING IT 
BUT SHE'S KIND OF STOPPED THAT NOW 
NOW EVERY TIME SHE ROLLS OVER THE WOUND'S GETTING COVERED IN SAND 
LEAVES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
BUT EVEN WITH THE HELP OF ANTIBIOTICS 
SAMIRA IS STRUGGLING TO RECOVER FROM THE ATTACK 
IF HER WOUNDS BECOME BADLY INFECTED THEY COULD PROVE FATAL 
WE HAD WORRIES WITH THESE FLIES BEING AROUND 
THAT THEY MIGHT LAY SOME EGGS ON HER AND SURE ENOUGH TODAY 
THERE ARE A FEW FLY EGGS ROUND THERE AND THERE'S ACTUALLY 
NOT VERY NICE AT ALL A FEW MAGGOTS THERE AS WELL 
SO THE VET'S COMING STRAIGHT BACK IN 
AND WE'LL PROBABLY END UP KNOCKING HER OUT 
AND GIVING IT A GOOD CLEAN UP 
THEY HAVE TO ACT NOW TO SAVE SAMIRA 
BEFORE THE MAGGOTS THAT ARE EATING AWAY AT HER FLESH 
REACH HER INTERNAL ORGANS 
WE'LL BE BACK WITH HER LATER AS SOON AS THE VET ARRIVES 
LAST YEAR WE FOUND OUT 
THAT SIBERIAN TIGERS JUST ADORE BAGS FILLED WITH LAVENDER 
NOW JIM VASEY AND MARK HAWKS HOPE 
THAT THE SUMATRAN TIGERS WILL LIKE LAVENDER TOO 
TO HELP THEM WITH A NEW PROJECT 
NOW I NOTICE YOU'VE GOT A TELEGRAPH POLE 
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR TIGER ENCLOSURE THAT'S RIGHT 
WHY HAVE YOU GOT THAT THERE 
WE USE IT AS A FEEDING STATION 
FOR THE TIGERS TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
THEY NORMALLY DON'T CLIMB FOR THEIR FOOD 
IT'S ENRICHMENT AT THE SAME TIME 
YOU'RE HOISTING FOOD UP THERE WE WILL DO 
BUT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME SCENT MARKING WITH LAVENDER 
ON SOME CLOTH TO GET THEM USED TO THE POLE 
ALSO WE'VE PUT A CAMERA UP THERE 
OH SO WE CAN GET SOME UNUSUAL SHOTS OF THEM CLIMBING THE POLE 
HOPEFULLY TWO EXTRA PAIRS OF HANDS ON DECK HERE HOW CAN WE HELP 
ME AND YOU ARE GOING TO GO OFF AND SEE THE TIGERS LOVELY 
TALK A BIT ABOUT THEM 
AND LEAVE THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO THE SCENT MARKING 
DO YOU LIKE THAT WE'RE THE YOUNG GUYS 
ALL RIGHT YOUNGSTERS SEE YOU LATER 
WE'VE GOT BITS OF CLOTH AND LAVENDER OIL O. K. 
I WANT YOU TO COVER THESE 
BE AS HAPPY AS YOU LIKE TO POUR IT ALL OVER COVER IT 
I'LL TACK THEM UP AS HIGH AS I CAN GET THEM 
DOT THEM ROUND IN A FEW PLACES 
AND AFTERWARDS WE'LL SEE HOW THEY REACT 
I'LL PASS YOU THE FIRST ONE UP 
FOR YOU TO START TACKING THEM IN OOH I CAN REALLY SMELL THAT 
HOW GOOD ARE TIGERS' SENSE OF SMELL THEY HAVE AN AMAZING SENSE OF SMELL 
IN THE WILD WHAT WOULD THEY NEED THAT FOR 
TRACKING DOWN THEIR PREY 
ALSO IF IT'S BREEDING SEASON IT HELPS THEM ATTRACT A MATE 
OH REALLY 
IT'S LIKE PERFUME IN PEOPLE 
PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED TO THE NICE SMELL 
SO THEY DO THAT SORT OF THING 
AND CAN PICK UP THEIR SCENT AND TRACK THEM DOWN 
I SMELL GREAT AT THE MOMENT MATT WE'RE DONE OVER HERE MATE 
WE'RE ON OUR WAY OVER WE'LL JOIN YOU O. K. 
HOW DO I ENCOURAGE THEM OVER THERE 
IF YOU HOLD THE CLOTH I SHALL PUT SOME LAVENDER ON THIS 
WE'VE GOT SOME HERE AS WELL IF YOU AS YOU WALK BACK 
DRAG IT ALONG THE GROUND OH I JUST 
JUST DRAG IT THAT'S IT AS WE GO O. K. LET'S MOVE ON OVER 
HERE THEY COME NOW DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING HI GUYS 
HI WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
WE'RE LAYING A SCENT TRAIL ALL THE WAY FROM THE GATE 
WHERE WE LET THEM OUT UP TO YOUR HANDIWORK 
WHO IS GOING TO BE FIRST OUT 
WHO'S THE MOST KEEN TO SMELL THIS 
PROBABLY AMIR THE BIG MALE 
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
THAT MEANS YOU JOIN US LATER ON IN THE SHOW TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS 
WHY DO FISH LIVE IN SALT WATER 
BECAUSE PEPPER MAKES THEM SNEEZE 
WHAT DO YOU GET WHEN YOU CROSS A PARROT WITH A PIG 
A BIRD WHO HOGS THE CONVERSATION 
KNOCK KNOCK WHO'S THERE GORILLA 
GORILLA WHO 
GORILLA ME A HAMBURGER I'M HUNGRY 
YOU SHOULD LAUGH THAT'S A GOOD ONE IT'S FUNNY ISN'T IT 
HA HA HA HA HA HA 
VET JEREMY STATTERSFIELD HAS ARRIVED TO HELP SAMIRA 
BUT SHE'LL CERTAINLY ATTACK IF HE GOES NEAR HER 
SO HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO KNOCK HER OUT WITH A SEDATIVE 
WE'RE GOING TO USE A PNEUMATIC BLOWPIPE 
TO DELIVER THE DOSE AND THAT'S GOING TO BE FIRED BY COMPRESSED AIR 
SO WE MAKE UP A LITTLE DART AND THE DRUG GOES IN 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH DARTING ANY LARGE CAT LIKE THIS 
IS THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE ENOUGH DRUG 
TO GET THE NICE CALM EFFECT THAT WE WANT 
AND IT'S ALWAYS SLIGHTLY FINGERS CROSSED 
SHE'S A VERY CALM ANIMAL SO WE'LL GO FOR A LOWER DOSE 
WITH MORE HIGHLY STRUNG HIGHLY CHARGED ANIMALS 
WE GO FOR MUCH HIGHER DOSES 
IT'S ALWAYS A GUESS TO JUDGE WHERE WE PITCH HER 
SAMIRA IS SUFFERING 
SO JEREMY WANTS TO GET ON WITH THE TREATMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
LOOK HERE ARE WE SET YEAH 
SHE SHOULD BE AN EASY TARGET BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE SHE MOVES AWAY 
SHE HAS AN INSTINCTIVE FEAR OF THE GUN 
SHE MAY NOT LIKE IT BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT JEREMY CAN HELP HER 
IF HE'S GOT THE DOSE RIGHT SHE'LL BE ASLEEP WITHIN MINUTES 
ARE YOU O. K. GIRL 
WE'LL COME BACK WHEN JEREMY THINKS IT'S SAFE TO GO IN WITH HER 
IN THE SUMATRAN TIGER ENCLOSURE THE LAVENDER SCENT IS IN PLACE 
THE CAMERA ON THE POLE IS WORKING 
AND WE'VE RETREATED TO A SAFE DISTANCE 
JIM BEFORE WE DO THIS 
WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE FIRST UP THE POLE 
MALE OR FEMALE 
I'LL GO FOR THE MALE BUT I'VE GOT A SNEAKY FEELING 
THAT SHE'LL OVERTAKE HIM AND IT'LL BE THE FEMALE 
FINGERS CROSSED FOR THE BOYS 
I WANT TO SEE HOW MY HANDIWORK'S DONE SO LET THE TIGER'S OUT 
RIGHT MARK DO YOU WANT TO LET THEM GO 
YOU LEFT A TRAIL OF THE SCENT 
SO HOPEFULLY THEY'LL FOLLOW THAT AND GET UP THAT POLE YEAH 
HERE THEY COME 
WHICH ONE'S THAT WHO'S OUT FIRST THAT'S INDA AND THEN THE MALE 
OOH LOOK WHAT'S THE MALE'S NAME JIM AMIR INDA AND AMIR 
SHE IS FOLLOWING EXACTLY THE PATH I DRAGGED WITH THAT CLOTH 
YES LOOK AT THAT 
YOU CAN SEE THAT AMIR JUST PICKED UP THE SCENT 
YEAH HE DIPPED DOWN A BIT 
LOOK LOOK SHE LOOKED UP AT THE POLE THERE 
SO THEY HAVE A VERY ACUTE SENSE OF SMELL HOW'S THEIR EYESIGHT 
WILL THEY SPOT THE RAGS UP THERE YEAH YEAH LOOK THERE SHE GOES 
OH LOOK AT THAT 
WOW LET'S SEE THAT AGAIN 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY SMELL THE LAVENDER 
WELL IT GETS THE SENSES IN THEIR MOUTH GOING 
IT'S A BIT LIKE CATNIP O. K. FOR NORMAL CATS 
JIM I CAN SEE WHAT LOOKS LIKE CLAW MARKS ON THE POLE THERE 
AND WE KNOW THAT CATS HAVE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL CLAWS 
BUT COULD THEY CLIMB THAT POLE 
THEY COULD CLIMB THAT VERY EASILY REALLY 
TIGERS ARE QUITE HEAVY SO THEY'RE NOT THE BEST OF CLIMBERS 
RIGHT CATS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY GOOD 
BUT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO CLIMB UP THERE AS AN ENRICHMENT 
YOU'VE PUT THIS FANTASTIC BIT OF APPARATUS UP HERE 
SO WHAT'S NEXT FOR THIS CLIMBING POLE 
NOW THAT WE'VE TRIED THE SCENT THE NEXT STAGE IS 
TO PUT FOOD THERE WHICH IS WHAT IT'S THERE FOR 
WE WILL DO THAT NEXT 
THAT WILL BE VERY EXCITING CAN WE HAVE A LOOK 
CERTAINLY BRILLIANT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WHEN YOU'VE GET THE MEAT UP FOR THE FEED 
O. K. LOOK FORWARD TO IT 
ON THIS SERIES WE HAVE SEVERAL ROAR RANGERS HELPING US 
AND DISCOVERING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AN ANIMAL KEEPER 
OUR FIRST ROAR RANGER IS NED 
FROM BROMLEY IN KENT 
AND HE'S ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
HIS MISSION FOR THE DAY 
NED TODAY YOU ARE A RHINO KEEPER 
YOU JOB IS TO WAKE THE RHINOS UP WITH THEIR BREAKFAST YES 
THIS IS AMAZING 
RHINOS ARE LIKE ONE OF THE MOST FANTASTIC ANIMALS EVER 
AND LIKE I CAN'T WAIT TO GO FEED THEM 
THEY MIGHT LIKE PORRIDGE OR WEETABIX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I DON'T THINK SO 
NED IS ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THE RHINO KEEPER STUART JONES 
HE'S ABOUT TO WAKE UP SALOME A SEVEN YEAR OLD AFRICAN BLACK RHINO 
OF WHICH THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED LEFT IN THE WILD 
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING I'M NED NICE TO MEET YOU NED 
MY NAME'S STUART SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO POP YOURSELF IN O. K. 
NONE OF US LIKE BEING WOKEN UP EARLY 
COME ON GIRL AND A SLEEPY RHINO IS NO EXCEPTION 
SALOME 
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GET UP 
BUT STUART KNOWS THAT SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO RESIST A BANANA OR TWO 
OR EIGHT FOR THAT MATTER 
SALOME COME ON SWEET 
AND SHE'S JUST POPPING ROUND NOW 
AMAZING SHE'S A VERY VERY VERY BIG GIRL ISN'T SHE 
I THOUGHT THEY'D BE SMALLER THAN THAT 
DID YOU REALLY YEAH THEY'RE BIG ANIMALS 
THEIR MOUTHS ARE REALLY FASCINATING 
THE WAY LIKE THEY ARE THEY'RE WEIRD 
AND YOU CAN SEE WITH THIS NICE OLD BIG TOP LIP 
THEY USE IT A BIT LIKE A HAND 
IN THE WILD WHAT THEY'LL DO IS 
THEY'LL GRAB THE LEAVES BREAK THEM OFF BREAK OFF SMALL TWIGS 
AND THAT'S EXTREMELY STRONG 
THEY CAN PRETTY MUCH RIP UP ROOTS 
AND SHRUBS SO YEAH IT'S A GOOD TOOL TO HAVE FOR A RHINO 
COME ON THEN SALOME 
SALOME IS NOW WIDE AWAKE SO IT'S TIME TO LET HER HAVE A PLAY 
REALLY AWESOME 
BUT BREAKFAST ISN'T OVER YET 
SHE'S JUST GETTING STARTED 
AND WITH AN APPETITE LIKE THAT SHE'S LEFT QUITE A MESS 
FOR OUR RANGER TO CLEAN UP 
STINKS A BIT IT DOES SMELL QUITE BAD YEAH 
BUT AFTER A FEW YEARS OF WORKING YOU YOU KIND OF GET USED TO IT 
HOW MUCH DOES A RHINO POO WELL OUR RHINOS WILL ACTUALLY POO 
ABOUT AS MUCH AS THIS WHEELBARROW CAN HOLD EVERY SINGLE DAY 
WOW THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE WHEELBARROWS A YEAR 
THAT'S ENOUGH TO COVER THE PITCH OF WEMBLEY 
IT'S QUITE HEAVY YOU KNOW IT IS QUITE HEAVY YEAH 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CLEAN IT UP 
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'D HAVE A WHOLE BEDROOM FULL OF POO 
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE IT NED ONLY A FEW MORE SHOVELS TO GO 
WELL THEN NED 
I THINK WE'VE PRETTY MUCH FINISHED CLEANING UP ALL SALOME'S POO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S BEEN VERY VERY FUNNY WORKING WITH YOU 
AND I THINK YOU'LL MAKE A GREAT RHINO KEEPER THANK YOU 
AS NED LOVED SALOME SO MUCH WE ASKED OUR ROAR RANGER 
TO GIVE US THE LOW DOWN WITH HIS RANGER DIARY 
TODAY I HAD TO BE A RHINO KEEPER 
WHEN I FIRST WALKED INTO THE ENCLOSURE 
WHERE THE RHINOS WERE SLEEPING I HAD BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH 
AMAZING 
I WAS QUITE SCARED AT FIRST 
BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY BIG ANIMALS AND THEY COULD REALLY HURT ME 
BUT AFTER FIVE MINUTES OR SO I GOT TO KNOW SALOME 
IT WAS REALLY NICE TO MEET SALOME AND I THINK I'VE MADE A NEW FRIEND 
JEREMY THE VET IS PREPARING TO GO INTO SAMIRA'S ENCLOSURE 
TO TREAT HER WOUNDS 
BUT HE NEEDS TO CHECK THAT SHE'S FULLY SEDATED BEFORE HE TOUCHES HER 
WE'RE DOING HERE A HIGHLY TECHNICAL PROCEDURE 
TO JUDGE THE DEPTH OF ANAESTHESIA AND WHAT WE DO 
IS WE STICK A BLUNT OBJECT IN THIS CASE A RAKE INTO THE EAR 
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD TEST BECAUSE IF I WAS TO GET A FEATHER 
AND STICK IT IN YOUR EAR YOU'D PROBABLY DO THAT SORT OF BUSINESS 
SO IT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY OF TESTING HOW FAR ASLEEP THEY ARE 
JEREMY NEEDS TO MAKE A CRITICAL JUDGEMENT 
IF SHE'S NOT PROPERLY ASLEEP SHE'LL MAKE MINCEMEAT OF THEM IN SECONDS 
GIVE HER A MINUTE 
A FEW MINUTES LATER THEY CHECK SHE ISN'T BLINKING 
AT LAST IT'S SAFE TO MOVE HER ONTO A CLEAN OPERATING TABLE 
FOR JEREMY TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HER WOUNDS 
HE DOESN'T HAVE GOOD NEWS 
O. K. YOU CAN SEE HERE 
WE'VE GOT SOME FLIES WHICH WERE PAYING ATTENTION 
THESE AREN'T ORDINARY HOUSE FLIES THESE ARE QUITE SPECIAL FLIES 
YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE GREEN 
AND THEY'RE THE SORT OF FLIES THAT WILL LAY THEIR EGGS ON FLESH 
IN ORDER TO GET TO THE DAMAGED AREAS 
SAMIRA'S MATTED HAIR NEEDS TO BE SHAVED OFF WITH ELECTRIC CLIPPERS 
TURN AWAY IF YOU'RE SQUEAMISH 
WHAT JEREMY FINDS UNDERNEATH ISN'T NICE 
AND LOOK WE'VE GOT MAGGOTS 
MAGGOTS DEVELOP INTO FLIES 
I THINK IN ALL HONESTY THIS IS THE MOST DISGUSTING THING AS A VET 
THAT I ACTUALLY HAVE SEEN 
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST SO HORRIBLE 
THAT THIS POOR ANIMAL IS QUITE LITERALLY BEING EATEN ALIVE 
O. K. WE'LL HAVE TO CLEAN THAT UP 
JEREMY'S USING LASHINGS OF ANTISEPTIC 
TO WIPE OUT THE MAGGOTS AND GERMS SO THE WOUNDS CAN HEAL NATURALLY 
BUT WHEN THEY TURN SAMIRA OVER 
JEREMY FINDS AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS INJURY TO FLUSH OUT 
THIS WOUND WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN CENTIMETRES DEEP 
SO EVEN ALLOWING FOR THE LENGTH OF A TOOTH 
IT HAS FORMED A POCKET OF INFECTION DOWN THERE 
AND I THINK THAT IS OR IT IS CERTAINLY A WOUND FROM A TOOTH 
WHEREAS ON THE OTHER SIDE WE SAW A NUMBER OF WOUNDS 
WHICH WERE MORE SCRATCH LIKE AND MORE PINPOINT 
AND THOSE ARE MORE TYPICAL OF CLAWS 
THE KEEPERS KNOW THAT SAMIRA IS BADLY HURT 
THEY CAN ONLY TRUST IN JEREMY'S SKILL 
AND HOPE THAT IT ISN'T TOO LATE FOR THIS LIONESS 
WE'LL COME BACK LATER TO FIND OUT 
HAVE YOU HAD A GO AT THE BRILLIANT ROAR GAME ON THE CBBC WEBSITE YET 
IF YOU FANCY HAVING A GO AT BEING AN ANIMAL KEEPER 
GET YOUR PENCILS READY 
BECAUSE TODAY'S CHEAT CODE IS ON YOUR SCREEN NOW 
IF YOU'VE PLAYED FOR A WHILE YOU'LL HAVE THIS CHEAT 
BUT WE'VE GOT SOMETHING NEW FOR EVERYBODY A BRAND NEW FEATURE 
CALLED RATE MY PARK WHERE YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT YOUR FRIENDS THINK 
ABOUT YOUR KEEPER SKILLS 
WHOO THE SUN IS SHINING AND IT'S REALLY HOT 
AND ON DAYS LIKE THIS KEEPERS LIZ MORRISON AND SUZANNE NOON 
LIKE TO GIVE THE ELLIES THE LITTLE TREAT OF AN ICE LOLLY 
I'VE BROUGHT THEM ALONG WILL THAT DO FOR THEM 
CALL THAT A LOLLY THAT WON'T LAST THEM A SECOND 
WELL I DID WONDER 
THESE ARE LOLLIES 
AH NOW THAT'S AN ELLY SIZED ICE CREAM 
AND LOOK YOU'RE NOT BIASED YOU'VE WRITTEN ELLIES RULE 
WELL IT'S TRUE YEAH 
SHALL WE GET THESE OUT QUICKLY 
BEFORE THEY MELT SURE WHERE SHALL I PUT THIS ONE

O. K. SUZANNE'S GONE OVER TO LET THE ELLIES IN 
WHO DO YOU THINK WILL BE FIRST LIZ 
I THINK IT WILL BE THE BIG BOY IT WILL BE JUMS THROUGH FIRST 
HERE THEY COME YEP SURE ENOUGH YES IT IS 
STRAIGHT OVER TO THE LOLLIES HE'S SPOTTED THEM 
HE'S HEADING FOR THE ORANGE MAYBE THAT'S HIS FAVOURITE 
MIND YOU HE'S CRUSHED IT SEE HOW POWERFUL HIS FOOT IS 
PUTS HIS FOOT ON THE LOLLY AND SQUASHES IT 
BREAKS IT INTO NICE LITTLE PIECES AMAZING HAS HE DONE THIS BEFORE 
HE JUST WENT STRAIGHT IN AND CRUSHED IT WITH HIS FOOT YEAH 
THAT REQUIRES SOME WORKING OUT 
WE GIVE THEM TO HIM WHEN IT'S HOT ENOUGH 
EVERY SUMMER THEY GET A FEW 
HE'S PROBABLY LEARNT OVER THE YEARS HOW TO DO IT 
AND YEAH I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY CLEVER 
AND YOU REALLY GET A SENSE OF JUST HOW HEAVY HE IS DON'T YOU 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SQUASH ICE YOU CAN'T DO IT BUT HE CAN 
IT JUST COMPRESSES AND BECOMES HARDER AND HARDER 
HE'S JUST OBLITERATED IT YEAH HOW MUCH DOES HE WEIGH 
DO YOU KNOW HE WEIGHS ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF TONS 
THAT'S ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF CARS 
QUITE BIG HE IS HE'S EASILY THE BIGGEST ELEPHANT I'VE EVER SEEN 
YEAH AND HE'S STILL GOT SOME GROWING TO DO IS THAT RIGHT 
THE ADULT BULLS ACTUALLY GROW UNTIL THEIR EARLY FORTIES 
AND HE'S ONLY THIRTY SO HE COULD STILL GROW A LITTLE BIT MORE 
INTERESTINGLY EVERYONE HAS LEFT HIM TO IT 
IS THAT BECAUSE HE'S GREEDY OR 
WHY HAVE ALL THE FEMALES DISAPPEARED 
WELL HE'S THE DOMINANT ONE OF THE GROUP 
AND YOU CAN SEE THE OTHER FEMALES TRYING TO GET IN 
TRYING TO PINCH A BIT THAT HE'S SQUASHED DOWN 
THE BITS OF FRUIT THAT ARE LEFT 
BUT IT'S NORMALLY THE HIGHER RANKING FEMALES 
THAT CAN COME IN AND PINCH A BIT 
WHO'S THIS NOW AH SHIBI 
YES SHE'S SHE'S NOT JUST GOING FOR A BIT 
SHE'S GOING FOR THE WHOLE THING SHE HASN'T LEARNED THE STAMPING TRICK 
NO SHE'S VERY BRAVE 
IF HE NOTICED DO YOU THINK HE'D BE CROSS 
MAYBE BUT SHIBI GETS AWAY WITH QUITE A LOT 
AS I SAY SHE'S QUITE A HIGH RANKING FEMALE SO HE'S NOT TOO BAD RIGHT 
IT'S WHEN THE LITTLE BABIES TRY TO PINCH STUFF HE MIGHT 
AS YOU SEE THERE COMING IN NOW TRYING TO STEAL BITS 
SUZANNE WHO'S THIS LITTLE TINY BABY THAT'S COME IN 
THIS IS JEMMA JEMMA 
YEAH AND IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY 
THEY CAN'T USE THEIR TRUNKS STRAIGHT AWAY WHEN THEY'RE LITTLE 
THEY HAVE LEARN YEAH IS JEMMA OLD ENOUGH 
SHE'S STARTING TO USE HER TRUNK A LOT MORE NOW 
AS YOU CAN SEE SHE COILS HER TRUNK ROUND 
AND PICKS UP THE TEENIEST BIT IT'S SLIPPING OUT OF HER TRUNK 
SHE'S DISCOVERING THAT ICE IS SLIPPERY 
SEE HER TRUNK'S ALL WIGGLING ROUND 
TWISTING WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THE MOST HUGE SUCCESS 
I'M ONLY A BIT JEALOUS BECAUSE YOU GOT AN ICE LOLLY AND I DIDN'T 
WELL YOU KNOW PERKS OF THE JOB MAYBE I'LL POP OFF AND GET ONE 
THE MORE WE CAN GET THIS INTO HER FUR 
THE MORE THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THINGS OFF 
WITH HER WOUNDS CLEANED UP SAMIRA'S OPERATION IS OVER 
NOW WHAT SHE NEEDS MORE THAN ANYTHING IS SOME PEACE AND QUIET 
SHE'LL WAKE UP SORE 
AND WILL REMAIN UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF THE KEEPERS 
CHRIS HALES IS JUST GLAD THE WHOLE ORDEAL IS OVER 
IT WAS QUITE REVOLTING I DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY EVER 
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT ON 'EM POOR LITTLE GIRL 
SHE WAS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED BY IT 
SHE WAS TRYING TO GET AROUND TO IT SHE WAS FLICKING HER TAIL ONTO IT 
WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE NASTY BECAUSE WE COULD SEE 
THE MAGGOTS COMING OUT 
WE WEREN'T AWARE OF THE FULL SCALE OF IT 
UNTIL WE GOT THE FUR OFF 
BUT YEAH IT'S O. K. IT'S ALL GONE WELL 
IT'S ALL BEEN NICELY CLEANED UP NOW SO HOPEFULLY 
THOSE PESKY FLIES WILL STAY AWAY FOR A WHILE 
GIVE HER TIME TO HEAL UP 
SAMIRA HAS BEEN BATTLING TO SURVIVE 
AGAINST THE ODDS SINCE SHE WAS A TINY CUB 
THEY SAY THAT CATS HAVE NINE LIVES 
WELL SHE MAY HAVE USED UP A FEW OF HERS BUT I AM DELIGHTED TO SAY 
THAT JUST A FEW DAYS LATER SHE WAS BACK TO HER OLD SELF 
LIMPING AROUND AS EVER 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THIS PLUCKY GIRL IS GOING TO LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY 
IT'S ALMOST THE END OF THE SHOW 
BUT BEFORE WE GO WE'RE MEETING KEEPER JAMIE ROBERTSON 
INSIDE THIS MAGNIFICENT OPEN TOPPED ENCLOSURE 
THAT'S HOME TO BOTH DEBRAZZA AND COLOBUS MONKEYS 
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM THOUGH I SEE A LITTLE DEBRAZZA HERE 
BUT WHERE AH HERE THEY COME NOW 
THE COLOBUS MONKEYS JUST ON QUEUE RIGHT BEHIND YOUR HEAD 
THERE'S A LOAD UP THERE AS WELL JAMIE YEAH 
THEY ALL SEEM TO BE HIDING AWAY 
IS THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NERVOUS OF US 
NO THE DEBRAZZAS ARE QUITE BULLIES 
WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD THEY JUST BULLY THE COLOBUS OFF 
AND THEY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE DEBRAZZAS MOVE AWAY OH YEAH 
RIGHT ON QUEUE HERE COMES A BRUISER DEBRAZZA 
AND OFF THEY GO UP THERE IT LOOKS LIKE A WHOLE FAMILY 
YEAH THERE'S A MALE JUST UP THERE TIA RIGHT 
THERE'S THREE FEMALES IN THAT GROUP UP THERE AND THERE'S NINE BABIES 
BUT THE DEBRAZZAS WON'T LET THEM COME DOWN AT THE MOMENT 
HOW ABOUT DEBRAZZA BABIES ANY SUCCESS THERE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL 
WE'VE GOT ONE THAT WAS BORN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO NOW 
OH SO SHE'S KABINDA'S THE MUM 
AND DOING WELL OH YES VERY WELL SHE'S A GOOD MUM 
SHE'S HAD ABOUT SEVEN KIDS NOW SO SHE KNOWS THE BUSINESS HOW EXCITING 
IN THE WILD DO YOU FIND DEBRAZZAS AND COLOBUS MONKEYS 
SHARING THE SAME AREA YEAH THEIR TERRITORIES WOULD OVERLAP 
RIGHT DEBRAZZAS MAINLY INHABIT THE LOWER PART OF THE FOREST 
WHEREAS COLOBUS STAY UP HIGH SO THEY CAN HAPPILY CO EXIST 
AND NOT COMPETE FOR THE SAME FOOD 
WOULD THEY EVER MINGLE WITH EACH OTHER 
THEY WOULD SORT OF IN THE WILD 
THEY WOULD CREATE ALERT GROUPS SO THAT THERE'S MORE EYES 
KEEPING OUT FOR PREDATORS THAT'S GOOD 
THEY CREATE SUPER COLONIES AMONG THE OTHER MONKEYS BUT 
IT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR 
YEAH EVEN IN HERE THE YOUNG COLOBUS AND DEBRAZZAS PLAY OH DO THEY 
THEY PLAY TOGETHER JAMIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IT'S A FASCINATING WAY TO END THE SHOW BUT SADLY WE'RE OUT OF TIME 
DON'T YOU WORRY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT LOADS MORE ANIMALS AT THE PARKS 
TO SHOW YOU IN OUR NEXT SHOW 
THERE'S CALF CHAOS AS WE CATCH UP 
WITH THESE FOUR MISCHIEVOUS YOUNG ELLIES 
OUR ROAR RANGER HAS A CLOSE ENCOUNTER 
WITH A HUGE SUMATRAN TIGER THAT IS LIKE AMAZING 
AND THESE VICIOUS HOGS MIGHT NOT HAVE THE PRETTIEST FACES 
BUT YOU SHOULD SEE THEIR CUTE BABIES
