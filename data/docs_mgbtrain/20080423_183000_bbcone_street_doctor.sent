TONIGHT ON STREET DOCTOR THAT'S A SHINER AND A HALF CRAVINGS ARE CONFESSED 
I'M ADDICTED TO COKE 
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT FIZZY COKE 
A BODY'S TRUE AGE IS REVEALED 
YOUR LUNGS ARE THE LUNGS OF A SIXTY TWO YEAR OLD 
AND A RARE CONDITION IS UNCOVERED IT WAS REALLY OFF PUTTING MY NAPKIN WAS COVERED IN BLOOD 
MEET THE STREET DOCTORS FOUR G. P.'S ON A MISSION TO TACKLE THE HEALTH OF BRITAIN 
FIRST UP IS DOCTOR JONTY WHOSE PASSION IS PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE 
NEXT ON THE MEDICAL FRONT LINE IS DOCTOR GEORGE 
WHO'S FASCINATED BY MATTERS OF THE HEART 
DOCTOR BARBARA IS OUR FEMALE G. P. WHO SPECIALISES IN WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
AND FINALLY DOCTOR AYAN 
WHOSE FOCUS IS MEN'S HEALTH 
THEY TRAVEL THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF BRITAIN SEARCHING FOR PATIENTS TO TREAT 
THEIR MISSION TO MAKE THE U. K. STREETS A HEALTHIER PLACE 
THIS WEEK THEIR TARGET ABERDEEN 
NO APPOINTMENTS NO WAITING THE STREET DOCTORS ARE COMING TO YOU 
SCOTLAND IS THE SECOND FATTEST NATION IN THE WORLD BEHIND AMERICA 
LIFE EXPECTANCY IN SCOTLAND IS AMONGST THE LOWEST IN WESTERN EUROPE 
HEART ATTACKS CANCER AND STROKES ARE THE BIGGEST KILLERS IN ABERDEEN 
THEY'LL LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED IN THEIR CHALLENGE TO RESUSCITATE THE HEALTH OF THE GRANITE CITY 
FEELS MUCH BETTER ALREADY DOES IT THANKS YOU'RE A VERY BRAVE BOY 
THEY'LL SCALE THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN ANYONE NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR HERE 
DELVE DEEP INTO THE CULTURE 
TARTAN WELLIES THAT'S THE LADIES' SECTION I'LL GO TO THE MEN'S 
AND PUT THE FACTS ON THE LINE 
YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT 
IT'S EARLY MORNING IN ABERDEEN 
AND DOCTOR JONTY AND DOCTOR GEORGE HEAD STRAIGHT TO THE SHOPS WHERE FRED IS IN NEED OF THEIR HELP 
HI ANYBODY NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR YES ME YOU DO 
YES IT'S MY LEG ACTUALLY 
I THINK I'VE GOT VARICOSE VEINS 
GOOD JOB I HAD A SHOWER THIS MORNING IT IS 
WHEN DID YOU START HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THEM WELL IT'S HEREDITARY AS YOU MAY KNOW 
MY MOTHER GAVE THEM TO ME WHEN SHE DIED SO I'VE HAD 'EM EVER SINCE REALLY 
WHAT VARICOSE VEINS ARE ARE VEINS WHERE THE VALVES ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY 
BECAUSE THE BLOOD RETURNS TO THE HEART ALL THE WAY UP VIA THE VEINS 
AND IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE VALVES WORKING PROPERLY IF I STOOD UP 
THEN ALL THE BLOOD WOULD JUST DRAIN AND COLLECT ROUND ABOUT MY ANKLES 
I'M JUST LOOKING GEORGE AROUND HERE 
THIS TO ME AS A DOCTOR IS QUITE WORRYING BECAUSE ONE OF THE COMPLICATIONS OF VARICOSE VEINS 
IS THAT YOU CAN DEVELOP ULCERS IN THE LEG 
O. K. WE CALL THEM VENOUS ULCERS 
YOU GET CHANGES IN THE SKIN THAT INITIALLY ARE A BIT LIKE ECZEMA 
THAT CAN BREAK DOWN AND FORM AN ULCER 
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KEEP THE SKIN WELL MOISTURISED 
AND I THINK YOU NEED SOMETHING TO TRY AND STOP THE BLOOD POOLING 
AND SWELLING IN THE LEGS SO MUCH 
HOW ABOUT WE TRY SOME STOCKINGS YES 
THEY ARE TOUGH TO PUT ON I KNOW 
YOU MAY NEED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP 
THERE'S THE HEEL IT'S STUCK ON THE SMALL TOE 
COME ON YOU'RE THE EXPERT AT THAT I AM NOT TOUCHING HIS FEET 
YOU THINK HE'S STRUGGLING IT'S HARD THERE WE GO 
MEN ARE NOT USED TO DOING THIS 
ARE YOU ABLE TO GET THAT OVER 
TIME WILL TELL IF WE HAVE THE TIME 
A LITTLE BIT OF PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT 
IF YOU USE THEM REGULARLY IT'LL REDUCE THE RISK OF ULCERS 
AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
YOU HAVE TO GET UP AT SEVEN A M. TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AT TEN A M. 
COS IT'LL TAKE YOU THREE HOURS TO GET YOUR TIGHTS ON 
MEANWHILE DOCTOR BARBARA IS IN THE HIGHLANDS 
HER FIRST STOP THE WILDLIFE PARK WHERE THE SNOW MONKEYS ARE LOOKING RATHER FAMILIAR 
THAT ONE'S AYAN THAT ONE'S GEORGE 
AND THAT ONE'S JONTY CLEANING HIMSELF 
SHE'S SOON CALLED ON BY CHRISTINE WHO HAS A BIT OF A DRINK PROBLEM 
HI HELLO THERE CAN I HELP YOU AT ALL 
YES PLEASE I NEED SOME HELP 
I'M ADDICTED TO COKE 
YOU'RE ADDICTED TO COKE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT 
FIZZY COKE YES YOU'RE NOT SNORTING IT 
NO DEFINITELY NOT 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ADDICTED TO COKE THIRTY YEARS 
FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS 
YEAH I DRINK ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE TINS A DAY NO MM HMM 
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE IT HOW DO YOU FEEL 
I GET SHAKY AND I GET SORE HEADS 
I'M HAVING TROUBLE SLEEPING 
I DO HAVE PALPITATIONS SOMETIMES IN MY HEART 
RIGHT I JUST CAN'T DO WITHOUT IT 
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE BETWEEN SEVEN TO TEN SPOONFULS OF SUGAR IN EVERY CAN OF COKE YEAH 
IF WE WORK THAT OUT HOW MANY CANS OF COKE ARE YOU HAVING IN A DAY NINE NINE AT LEAST NINE 
SO IF WE MADE IT EASIER AND SAID YOU WERE HAVING TEN 
THAT'S SEVENTY SPOONFULS OF SUGAR YEAH 
THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE CAFFEINE 
YEAH AND THE CAFFEINE IS A STIMULANT YEAH 
IF YOU'VE DRANK BETWEEN SEVEN TO TEN CANS A DAY 
FOR THIRTY YEARS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP IT JUST LIKE THAT 
IT'S PROBABLY AS DIFFICULT AS COMING OFF CIGARETTES YEAH OR ALCOHOL EVEN 
I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT YOU COME OFF IT SLOWLY 
ONE THING WE COULD DO THOUGH IS CHECK YOUR BLOOD SUGAR 
AND CHECK YOUR URINE AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVEN'T GOT HIGH GLUCOSE 
IT'S NEVER BEEN CHECKED HAS IT NOT 
NO I'VE NEVER SAID TO ANYONE ABOUT IT HAVE YOU NOT 
SHALL WE GO SOMEWHERE WHERE I CAN LAY MY THINGS OUT YES 
WHILST DOCTOR BARBARA PUTS CHRISTINE THROUGH HER MEDICAL PACES 
BACK IN ABERDEEN DOCTOR AYAN ARRIVES IN STYLE 
AND HE MEETS HIS FIRST PATIENT BEFORE HE EVEN LEAVES THE AIRPORT 
TWO YEAR AGO I'VE BEEN HAVING BOTHER WITH MY EYES BLURRED VISION TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
I'VE DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT COS I WAS GOING TO SEE THE OPTICIAN TO TEST MY EYESIGHT 
I FELT IT WAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 
LATELY IT'S STARTED TO COME BACK AGAIN AND IT LASTS ABOUT AN HOUR 
IT'S AT THE POINT WHERE I'M WRITING STUFF DOWN I CAN'T PHYSICALLY SEE WHAT I'M WRITING 
ANY HEADACHE WITH IT 
NO DO YOU EVER SEE ZIGZAG LINES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
THE ZIGZAG LINES ARE WHEN I SHUT MY EYE I CAN SEE ZIGZAG LINES 
JUST GOING ON WHAT YOU'RE GIVING ME I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING CALLED OPTICAL MIGRAINE 
AND OFTEN PEOPLE THAT SUFFER FROM MIGRAINE GET A WARNING SIGN 
THE WARNING SIGN ARE NORMALLY VISUAL SYMPTOMS AND YOU'RE GETTING THOSE THINGS BUT WITHOUT THE HEADACHES 
WHAT CAUSES MIGRAINE IN TERMS OF WHY PEOPLE GET IT 
IS SPASM OF BLOOD VESSELS IN THE BRAIN AND IT CAN BE TRIGGERED BY LOTS OF THINGS 
A GOOD THING FOR YOU TO DO MIGHT BE TO KEEP A DIARY OF WHEN YOU GET THESE EPISODES AND YOU MIGHT FIND PATTERNS 
IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE EATING AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
BUT IN TERMS OF TREATMENT NORMAL ANTI INFLAMMATORIES THINGS LIKE IBUPROFEN 
OR THERE'S A TABLET CALLED CO CODAMOL AND THERE ARE SPECIFIC DRUGS CALLED TRIPTANS 
THAT ACTUALLY WORK ON THE SPASM ON THE BLOOD VESSELS THAT AGAIN YOU CAN NOW BUY OVER THE COUNTER 
DOES THAT SOUND ALL RIGHT I CAN GIVE IT A GO 
AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS I'VE GOT A NAME FOR IT NOW THANK YOU 
OUR FOUR G. P.'S ARE POUNDING THE STREETS OF ABERDEEN 
FINDING PATIENTS IN THE MOST UNLIKELY OF PLACES 
IT'S NOT THE SIX PACK IT USED TO BE 
IT'S MID MORNING AND DOCTOR GEORGE HEADS TO THE BAKERY FOR A WEE SNACK 
WHERE CELIA IS PREPARING FOR HER NEXT DELIVERY 
HI THAT SEEMS A HEAVY TRAY OF CAKES YOU'RE HAVING TO MANOEUVRE EVERY DAY 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD BUT I HAVE A SORE HIP AND OCCASIONALLY IT'S SORE AS I TWIST COMING OUT THE VAN 
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT THAT WOULD BE FINE 
NO BOTHER PUT THE TRAY DOWN THAT'S GREAT 
WHAT ABOUT EXAMINING YOU IN THE BACK OF THE VAN YES PUT YOU UP THAT SIDE THERE 
I'LL GET IN FIRST THERE WE ARE THAT'S GOOD NOW WHICH HIP IS IT THAT'S BOTHERING YOU 
THEY BAITH GET SARE 
THEY BAITH GET SARE 
THAT MEANS THEY BOTH GET SORE THEN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE ONE'S SOREST 
IF YOU WOULD WANT TO LIE ON YOUR TUM 
LIE ON YOUR TUMMY THERE PUT YOUR HEAD AT THE TOP END THERE 
THE REASON I'VE GOT YOU ON YOUR TUMMY 
IS THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT OF THE HIP THAT I CAN DO IS TO EXTEND AT THE HIP 
NOW THIS IS THE ONE THAT YOU SAY IS THE WORST OF THE TWO ISN'T THAT RIGHT 
CAN WE OH GOD YEAH 
I CAN HARDLY MOVE IT AT ALL 
ARE YOU FEELING PAIN IN YOUR HIP JOINT WHEN I DO THAT 
AND IN THE BOTTOM OF MY BACK 
FAIR ENOUGH WE'D BETTER SQUEEZE OUT THE VAN WHILST THE GOING'S GOOD 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT THAT YOU'VE GOT A DEGREE OF OSTEOARTHRITIS IN YOUR HIP JOINT 
PARTICULARLY IN THAT RIGHT HIP 
LOOKING AT THE SKELETON HERE 
WHERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR PROBLEM IS ON ONE OF THE MAIN WEIGHT BEARING JOINTS 
WHICH IS GETTING SORT OF CEMENTED IN 
INSTEAD OF ALWAYS THINKING I'LL TAKE ANTI INFLAMMATORY TABLETS 
TO ACTUALLY MOBILISE A JOINT AND SOMETIMES LUBRICATE OIL IT THAT'S RIGHT OIL IT 
THAT'S WHY SOME PATIENTS FIND WHEN THEY TAKE THE LIKES OF FISH OILS AND GLUCOSAMINE CHONDROITIN 
WHICH ARE NATURAL PRODUCTS 
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS THEY'RE PUTTING THE OIL IN THE JOINT 
SO THERE YOU ARE KEEP OILING THE JOINTS ALL THE BEST 
LOVELY SEEING YOU CHEERS 
OVER AT THE SHOPPING CENTRE DOCTOR JONTY IS CALLED ON TO GIVE STEPHEN A HELPING HAND 
HI THERE WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU IT'S MY FINGER 
IT STARTED OFF WITH A SMALL LUMP A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO 
BUT OVER THE LAST YEAR IT'S GOT A LOT WORSE 
YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SIDE HOW IT'S CREASED AND FOLDED OVER 
THE LITTLE FINGER'S BECOME QUITE BENT AROUND CAN'T YOU 
HOW'S THIS HAND IT'S STARTING 
THERE'S A SMALL LUMP STARTING THERE 
IT'S MOVING TO SPREAD 
YOU CAN FEEL IT IT FEELS LUMPY 
SIMILARLY 
LOOK I'M CONFIDENT I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS O. K. 
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED DUPUYTREN'S CONTRACTURE 
TELL ME AGAIN WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING 
I'M A LANDSCAPE GARDENER THAT FITS EXACTLY 
THIS IS MORE COMMON IN MEN 
AND IT'S MORE COMMON IN PEOPLE WHO DO ANY SORT OF HEAVY MANUAL LABOUR 
UNDERNEATH THE SKIN THERE'S A TENDONOUS LAYER CALLED THE FASCIA 
IT'S LIKE A FLAT TENDONOUS PIECE OF MATERIAL GOING ACROSS THE WHOLE FLAT OF THE PALM 
AS IT TIGHTENS YOU GET A LUMPINESS AND YOU GET THE CONTRACTURE OF YOUR HAND 
AT THE MOMENT ALTHOUGH IT'S AFFECTING THE LITTLE FINGER 
OVER TIME THE HAND CAN BECOME QUITE A LOT MORE AFFECTED 
THE TREATMENT IS BASICALLY GOING TO BE SURGICAL 
BECAUSE WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO DO IS RELEASE THAT CONTRACTION TO ALLOW THE FINGER TO OPEN OUT AGAIN 
I WOULD ONLY SUGGEST THAT REALLY WHEN IT'S STARTING TO CAUSE YOU PROBLEMS 
IN TERMS OF YOUR FUNCTION WITH THE HAND 
SO VERY COMMON AND NOT DANGEROUS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT CHEERS 
BACK IN THE HIGHLANDS DOCTOR BARBARA IS GIVING COKE ADDICT CHRISTINE A THOROUGH HEALTH CHECK 
WHAT DID YOU DRINK BEFORE YOU DRANK COKE IRN BRU IRN BRU 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE OVER NINETY FIVE WHICH IS A BIT ELEVATED 
IT'S NOT VERY HIGH AND I'M NOT WORRIED 
YOUR BLOOD SUGAR IS FORTY TWO WHICH IS NORMAL 
BUT IT DOESN'T GET YOU OUT OF PASSING ME A URINE SAMPLE 
NO PROBLEM 
THERE'S MY COKE AHA 
THAT'S INTERESTING YOU'VE GOT SOME BLOOD IN YOUR URINE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
WELL IT CAN MEAN INFECTION BUT IT CAN MEAN STONES 
LITTLE POLYPS IN THE BLADDER 
I THINK THAT NEEDS INVESTIGATING 
AND WE WOULDN'T KNOW WHETHER YOU HAD ANYTHING IN YOUR BLADDER 
UNLESS SOMEBODY HAD A LITTLE LOOK WITH A CAMERA 
UH HUH IF SOMEBODY HAS BLOOD IN THEIR URINE WE REFER THEM TO A SPECIAL CLINIC A UROLOGY CLINIC 
I'M GLAD I'VE SEEN YOU TODAY BECAUSE I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN 
I'LL CHECK UP ON YOU AND SEE HOW YOU'RE GETTING ON IS THAT ALL RIGHT THAT'S FINE O. K. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD LUCK WITH THAT THANK YOU 
BEAUTIFUL 
DOCTOR BARBARA RECOMMENDS YOU DRINK NO MORE THAN THREE CAFFEINE BASED DRINKS A DAY 
IF YOU WANT TO CUT BACK NOTE DOWN EXACTLY HOW MUCH YOU'RE DRINKING 
DON'T GO COLD TURKEY 
REDUCE HALF YOUR INTAKE OVER A WEEK 
AND HALVE IT AGAIN THE FOLLOWING WEEK 
IF YOU NEED A CUP OF SOMETHING TRY DECAF OR EXPERIMENT WITH HERBAL TEA 
IF YOU NEED MORE SUPPORT SEE YOUR G. P. 
DOCTOR AYAN IS IN ABERDEEN'S HISTORIC CITY CENTRE WHERE EMILY IS IN NEED OF HIS EXPERT ADVICE 
NICE TO MEET YOU MY NAME'S DOCTOR AYAN WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU 
I'VE GOT THIS HORRIBLE LUMP THERE 
OH WOW THAT'S A SHINER AND A HALF ISN'T IT 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD IT THERE 
JUST A MINUTE NOW 
I FELL LAST YEAR HAD A BAD FALL AND I BROKE THIS WRIST AND IT WAS AFTER THAT 
AND DID IT COME UP SUDDENLY 
I DON'T KNOW IT JUST APPEARED 
I WAS IN A BAD WAY WITH ONE HAND IN PLASTER AND I DIDN'T NOTICE 
YEAH IT LOOKS AND FEELS TO ME LIKE A GANGLION 
WHAT A GANGLION IS IS THEY TEND TO OCCUR NEAR JOINTS 
WHEREVER YOU'VE GOT TENDONS AND A SHEATH THAT COVERS THE TENDON 
OFTEN YOU CAN GET A COLLECTION OF FLUID NEAR THERE 
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS YOU THINK IT'S JUST FLUID YES IT FEELS VERY SOLID DOESN'T IT 
YOU CAN GET THEM REMOVED BUT THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO COME BACK 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU DRAIN THEM 
IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT GETTING IT REMOVED IT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY A SURGEON 
SO THEY TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OUT 
EVERYBODY SAYS YOU PUT YOUR HAND ON THE TABLE 
AND THEN THUMP IT WITH THE FAMILY BIBLE AND IT DISAPPEARS 
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THE OLD SCHOOL DOCTORS TALKED ABOUT WHACKING IT WITH THE FAMILY BIBLE 
WE WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THAT 
WE'D PROBABLY JUST SAY TO LEAVE IT UNLESS IT REALLY STARTED BOTHERING YOU 
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT TAKE CARE 
AS THE STREET DOCTORS CONTINUE THEIR MISSION IN ABERDEEN 
THEY'RE SHOUTING FROM THE ROOFTOPS 
ANYONE NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR 
ANALYSING AILMENTS YOU COULD HAVE AN AUTO IMMUNE CONDITION 
AND LEADING SOME FOLK A MERRY DANCE 
PULL ME TOWARDS YOU GO ON THAT'S IT ALL RIGHT 
BACK AT THE BAKERY DOCTOR GEORGE IS SATISFYING HIS SWEET TOOTH WITH CONFECTIONER WENDY 
WANT TO TRY IT CERTAINLY LOOKS EASY WHEN YOU DO IT WENDY 
YOU COULD SAY IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE BUT IT WON'T BE LIKE THAT WHEN I TRY 
CLOSE ENOUGH 
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH 
CHRONIC HEARTBURN 
CHRONIC HEARTBURN TELL ME ABOUT IT 
IT STARTED THREE MONTHS AGO IT'S BEEN PAINFUL WORKING IN A BAKERY IT'S A TEMPTATION 
EVERY TIME I EAT IT JUST BUILDS RIGHT BACK UP AGAIN AND IT'S VERY PAINFUL 
IS IT IN YOUR CHEST OR YOUR TUMMY IT STARTS OFF IN MY TUMMY 
BUT IT COMES UP TO THE MIDDLE OF MY CHEST THAT'S WHEN IT'S REALLY BAD 
ANY WIND 
YEAH I'M GOOD AT BURPING 
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER WHEN YOU DO THAT 
YES FOR A WHOLE TEN MINUTES AND THEN IT STARTS BUILDING UP AGAIN RIGHT 
CERTAIN THINGS THAT CAN CAUSE THIS OR MAKE IT WORSE 
IS DRINKING A LOT OF CAFFEINE 
DO YOU TAKE A LOT OF COFFEE MAYBE ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE CUPS A DAY EIGHT OR NINE CUPS A DAY 
THAT'S A LOT OF CUPS PER DAY PEOPLE DON'T OFTEN REALISE THERE'S CAFFEINE IN CHOCOLATE 
THAT'S NOT ANOTHER THING WHERE YOU FALL DOWN UPON IS IT 
DO YOU TAKE LOTS OF CHOCOLATE 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME YOU SMOKE CIGARETTES ARE YOU OH WENDY 
IT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA TO HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR TUM WE CAN DO IT HERE ACTUALLY 
JUST MOVE THE CAKE A BIT THAT'S GREAT 
CAN YOU MAYBE PULL YOUR TUMMY UP 
IF PEOPLE HAVE ULCER PAIN WE TEND TO PINPOINT IT RIGHT THERE 
AT WHAT DOCTORS CALL THE EPIGASTRIUM 
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THAT AND AS I PRESS INTO THE TUMMY NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
THAT'S NOT SORE 
SO I'M PRETTY CONVINCED THAT YOUR PROBLEM IS ACID REFLUX 
SOMETIMES THERE'S A VALVE AT THE BASE OF THE GULLET 
WHICH ISN'T WORKING PROPERLY AND THAT ALLOWS THE ACID TO REGURGITATE BACK 
SO WHAT SHOULD YOU WENDY BE DOING ABOUT IT 
YOU'VE GOT TO FOLLOW THE RIGHT LIFESTYLE CUT BACK ON THE CAFFEINE 
CUT BACK ALSO ON TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE AND ONE OF THE BIGGIES 
THE BIGGIES IN MANY THINGS IS SMOKING CIGARETTES 
IF YOU'VE GOT REFLUX PLEASE TRY AND CUT BACK ON THAT 
SO GOOD SOUND WHOLESOME ADVICE 
IF YOU FOLLOW THOSE I THINK THAT THINGS WILL BE ALL RIGHT 
IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE THE SYMPTOMS OF ACID REFLUX DOCTOR GEORGE SUGGESTS 
THEY ARE THE TWO MAIN CAUSES 
EAT SMALLER PORTIONS MORE OFTEN 
AND STAY CLEAR OF FOODS THAT TRIGGER THE CONDITION 
TALK TO YOUR PHARMACIST 
AS THERE ARE MANY MEDICINES ON THE MARKET THAT COULD HELP 
IF YOUR SYMPTOMS DO PERSIST SEE YOUR G. P. 
NO MOUNTAIN IS TOO HIGH FOR OUR G. P.'S 
AS DOCTOR BARBARA AND DOCTOR AYAN SCALE OVER FOUR THOUSAND FEET TO THE SUMMIT OF CAIRNGORM MOUNTAIN 
DOCTOR BARBARA'S MEDICAL EXPERTISE IS SOON CALLED ON BY AMANDA WHO HAS A WORRYING LUMP 
HELLO THERE HI 
I HEARD IT IN THE WIND THAT YOU NEEDED TO SEE A STREET DOCTOR 
I'VE GOT THIS BUMP ON MY HEAD 
THAT FEELS AS THOUGH IT'S GETTING A WEE BIT BIGGER 
I THOUGHT YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING I SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT 
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LOOK 
OH YES THIS IS NOT A WORRYING LUMP 
GOOD IS IT TENDER AT ALL 
NO DOESN'T HURT THIS IS A SEBACEOUS CYST 
WE HAVE LOTS OF SEBACEOUS GLANDS IN THE SCALP 
YOU KNOW WHICH WE SORT OF PERSPIRE FROM 
SOMETIMES THEY GET A LITTLE BIT BLOCKED 
AND THEY FILL UP WITH A CHEESY LIKE MATERIAL 
OH SOUNDS HORRIBLE 
SORRY 
BUT THEY'RE QUITE EASY TO REMOVE DO I HAVE TO 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO IT WON'T CAUSE YOU ANY HARM IF YOU LEFT IT THERE 
THEY CAN BECOME INFECTED IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES 
PERHAPS MADE A LITTLE BIT WORSE AT TIMES 
IF YOU'RE WEARING SOMETHING VERY CLOSE TO YOUR SCALP LIKE THIS HELMET 
THEY'RE EASY TO REMOVE MINOR SURGERY A LITTLE NICK AND OUT THEY COME 
IF IT BECAME INFECTED WOULD IT START BEING TENDER 
IF IT WAS INFECTED YOU'D KNOW ABOUT IT 
IT WOULD BE VERY SORE AND INFLAMED 
THEN YOU'D JUST HAVE SOME ANTIBIOTICS AND THAT WOULD SORT IT OUT FOR YOU 
IT CAN STAY THERE 
SO ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER AND A FEW THOUSAND FEET DOWN THE MOUNTAIN DOCTOR GEORGE IS AT LOCH INSCH 
WHERE HIS NEXT PATIENT GERRY IS DESPERATE FOR HELP WITH A FIVE YEAR MEDICAL MYSTERY 
I'VE BEEN HAVING AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH MY THROAT AND MY MOUTH 
IT GOES BACK FOUR OR FIVE YEARS TO BE HONEST 
I EXPERIENCED BLOOD BLISTERS IN MY MOUTH 
SOMETIMES IN THE TONGUE AND SOMETIMES IN THE ROOF 
I WOULD FOUND IF THEY POPPED THEY TURNED INTO OPEN SORES 
AND I COULDN'T EAT OR DRINK FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS 
I'VE LOST THE BLISTERS IN MY MOUTH 
I FEEL THAT THERE'S SOMETHING STUCK IN MY THROAT YES 
EVEN BY PUTTING MY FINGER IN I CAN FEEL THESE LITTLE BLISTER TYPE THINGS 
WHAT I THINK I SHOULD DO IS MAYBE HAVE A LOOK IN YOUR MOUTH 
SIT YOURSELF DOWN THERE JUST FOR A SEC 
OPEN YOUR MOUTH WIDE HEAD BACK A BIT THAT'S GREAT 
THAT'S GRAND 
SAY AH AH AGAIN 
AH HOLD IT AH AH 
YOU CAN STILL SEE THE WATER BLISTERS 
INDEED THE ONES IN MY MOUTH WERE BLOOD FILLED NOT WATER BASED 
WHEN I WAS EATING THEY WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR 
YES AND IF THEY DID POP THEY PUT OUT A FAIR AMOUNT OF BLOOD 
IT HAPPENED IN A RESTAURANT IN EDINBURGH IT WAS OFF PUTTING MY NAPKIN WAS COVERED IN BLOOD 
CERTAINLY THIS IS INTERESTING GERRY 
AND IT'S NOT AN EASY DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD IT FOR FIVE YEARS 
THERE IS A CONDITION CALLED PEMPHIGUS 
WHICH IS AN AUTO IMMUNE CONDITION AND WE CAN DO A TEST FOR THAT 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD O. K. 
WE'VE NOW GOT THREE SAMPLES O. K. 
AND WE'LL GET THOSE AWAY AND GET THEM ANALYSED 
THANKS A LOT NICE SEEING YOU WE'LL SEE YOU WITH THE RESULTS OF THE TEST THANK YOU CHEERS 
IN THE HIGHLANDS DOCTOR AYAN AND DOCTOR BARBARA ARE OUT ON THE PISTE 
WHERE THE TERRITORIAL ARMY ARE COMPETING IN THEIR ANNUAL SKI CHALLENGE 
IN FROM THE COLD ARMY OFFICER RORY SHARES AN ON THE JOB DILEMMA 
SOMETIMES IF I'M STANDING AROUND TOO LONG 
THE BLOOD WILL RUSH TO MY FEET AND I'LL FALL OVER 
IT HAPPENS QUITE A LOT PARADES BIG PARADES I'VE DONE IT THREE TIMES 
AND WHEN IT'S HOT AS WELL 
I WAS QUITE WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT DOES HAPPEN ON A REGULAR BASIS 
YOU KNOW I GOT THE NICKNAME MANY YEARS AGO FLAKEY EVERY NOW AND THEN 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE WHEN YOU WAKE UP 
YES I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I AM 
IT'S LIKE A LIGHT GOING OFF AND COMING ON AGAIN IT'S USUALLY REALLY QUICK 
IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A SEIZURE 
NO IT SOUNDS LIKE A FAINT WHAT WE CALL A VASOVAGAL EPISODE 
IT HAPPENS FOR A FEW REASONS SHALL WE CHECK HIS BLOOD PRESSURE SITTING AND STANDING 
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA NOW DON'T TALK BECAUSE THAT PUTS YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE UP 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT OVER EIGHTY TWO THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD 
AND HIS PULSE IS EIGHTY BEATS PER MINUTE COULD YOU STAND UP PLEASE 
CERTAINLY 
THIS IS GREAT I LOVE BEING THIS TALL 
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE 
WHEN YOU'RE SITTING AND STANDING 
RIGHT DO NOT TALK SORRY YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK I'M BEING THE SERGEANT MAJOR 
ALTHOUGH THERE'S A DROP OF THREE UNITS 
THAT HAS TO BE A DROP OF TWENTY FOR IT TO BE OF SIGNIFICANCE AND WHAT WE WOULD THEN CLASS AS A POSTURAL DROP 
THAT'S IT IT REALLY DOES SOUND LIKE VASOVAGAL ATTACKS 
A DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE IT CAN HAPPEN PREGNANT WOMEN IT HAPPENS TO THANK YOU 
AND SOMETIMES STRESS CAN TRIGGER IT OR EMOTIONAL UPSET 
ONE OF THE SIMPLE THINGS TO DO IS TO WIGGLE YOUR TOES 
I TENSE MY CALVES AND I CAN FEEL THE BLOOD SORT OF GETTING PUSHED BACK UPWARDS 
YOU COULDN'T WEAR SUPPORT CLOTHES UNDERNEATH COULD YOU 
THAT WOULD BE A BIT AWKWARD BECAUSE WE WEAR THE KILT OH RIGHT 
DON'T YOU WEAR SOCKS TO THE KNEE 
YES YOU KNOW THE IN FLIGHT COMPRESSION STOCKINGS THAT YOU COULD WEAR UNDERNEATH YOUR SOCKS 
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY EFFECTIVELY COMPRESS THE CALF MUSCLE TO KEEP THE BLOOD FLOWING 
THAT WOULD BE QUITE GOOD TO SORT OF GET THE MESSAGE OUT TO SOLDIERS 
WHEN YOU SEE IT ON TROOPING THE COLOUR SOMEBODY FALLS OVER EVERY NOW AND THEN ABSOLUTELY 
I THINK YOU CAN CARRY ON YOUR MANOEUVRES NOW THANKS VERY MUCH NICE TALKING TO YOU 
THE STREET DOCTORS ARE RACING THROUGH ABERDEEN 
SQUEEZING IN ALL THE PATIENTS THEY CAN IS THAT COMFORTABLE NO NO 
WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT SEEING THE DOCTOR THAT YOU DON'T LIKE 
I JUST DON'T LIKE IT 
YOUR SISTER WILL BE A DOCTOR WHEN SHE GROWS UP SO SHE COULD LOOK AFTER YOU 
SHE'S CHANGED HER MIND TO BE A PRINCESS 
SHE'S GOING TO BE A PRINCESS INSTEAD IS SHE THAT'S SO LOVELY 
DOCTOR GEORGE IS BACK AT LOCH INSCH ARMED WITH BLOOD TEST RESULTS FOR FISHERMAN GERRY 
WHO HAS SUFFERED WITH PAINFUL BLISTERS IN HIS MOUTH FOR FIVE YEARS AND IS ANXIOUS FOR A DIAGNOSIS 
HI GEORGE NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN HOW ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT 
I'VE GOT THE RESULTS HERE 
WHAT ACTUALLY I CAN TELL YOU FROM THIS IS 
THE RESULTS ARE POSITIVE FOR PEMPHIGUS 
PEMPHIGUS IS WHAT'S CALLED AN AUTO IMMUNE CONDITION 
YEAH WHICH CAN CAUSE BLISTERS IN THE MOUTH 
AND OFTEN IN PATIENTS CAN CAUSE BLISTERING ON THE BODY AS WELL 
THE BODY'S DEFENCES ARE TURNING AGAINST ITSELF 
AND NOT RECOGNISING ITSELF AND IN SOME RESPECTS ALMOST ATTACKING ITSELF 
IT'S A RARE CONDITION AND WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TO SEE A SPECIALIST 
WHO COULD MAKE A DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS 
O. K. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IF THAT IS THE DIAGNOSIS 
YOU COULD BE GIVEN SPECIFIC TREATMENT 
WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT THE SORT OF TREATMENT THAT YOU GET IS CORTICAL STEROID TABLETS 
WHICH WOULD BE INITIATED BY THE SPECIALIST 
AND SOMETIMES TABLETS WHICH ARE CALLED IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS 
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL 
I'M NO HAPPY TO HAVE IT BUT I'M GLAD THAT IT'S SHOWN UP AS A PROBLEM 
AND WE CAN NOW ADDRESS THE PROBLEM 
I THINK WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION CONTINUE FISHING 
THANK YOU I HOPE YOU CATCH MANY BIG ONES FOR MANY YEARS TO COME 
YEAH I KNOW YOU WORRY ABOUT THE BONES GETTING STUCK 
ABSOLUTELY ALL THE BEST 
AS NIGHT FALLS OVER THE CITY 
DOCTOR GEORGE AND DOCTOR JONTY DON THEIR KILTS AND HIT THE DANCE FLOOR AT THE BRITISH LEGION CEILIDH 
I DON'T THINK I'M VERY GOOD I THINK I SHOULD STICK TO GENERAL PRACTICE 
I THINK I'M PRETTY AWFUL BUT TEN OUT OF TEN FOR EFFORT

BEFORE HANGING HIS DANCING SHOES UP FOR THE NIGHT 
DOCTOR JONTY HAS A WAKE UP CALL FOR OIL INDUSTRY WORKER KEVIN WITH A HARD HABIT TO BREAK

YES I'D LIKE HIM TO STOP I DON'T SMOKE I'M ASTHMATIC 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AND SEE COME ON 
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS BLOW OUT AS HARD AS YOU CAN 
AND THEN KEEP BLOWING AS LONG AS YOU CAN 
KEEP GOING KEEP GOING GO GO 
GO GO GO IS THAT IT O. K. 
YOU'RE HOW MANY YEARS OLD THIRTY NINE 
O. K. YOUR LUNGS ARE THOSE OF A SIXTY TWO YEAR OLD 
YOU CAN QUIT SMOKING AND ACTUALLY YOUR LUNG FUNCTION WILL IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY 
OR YOU CAN CARRY ON SMOKING AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE 
YOUR MISSUS IS TELLING YOU AS AN ASTHMATIC HOW DANGEROUS IT IS TO SMOKE 
WE'VE GOT NOT JUST NICOTINE REPLACEMENT BUT MEDICATIONS ON THE MARKET THAT HELP STOP SMOKING 
THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT YOU TO STOP I WOULD QUITE LIKE TO QUIT I HONESTLY WOULD 
SO YOU REALLY WOULD QUITE LIKE TO QUIT 
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT ALL RIGHT 
THANKS YOU TAKE CARE 
WITH THE ABERDEEN SURGERY COMPLETE DOCTOR GEORGE CAN'T HELP BUT TAKE CENTRE STAGE 
AND SHOW OFF HIS SKILLS ON THE ACCORDION 
IN ABERDEEN THE STREET DOCTORS HAVE TACKLED ISSUES OF AGE LIFESTYLE AND DIET 
WHAT DID THE DOCTORS THINK OF THEIR TIME HERE 
WHAT A GREAT TIME WE'VE HAD IN ABERDEEN TREMENDOUS PEOPLE 
TREMENDOUS LAUGHTER A TREMENDOUS SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND INTERESTING CASES 
I SAW A MAN WITH BLISTERS IN HIS MOUTH HAD THEM FOR FOUR TO FIVE YEARS
