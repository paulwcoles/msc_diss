GOOD AFTERNOON A FORTNIGHT AGO 
TODAY WE STARTED OUT IN SHEFFIELD 
ARMED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THIRTY TWO 
TITLE HOPEFULS SO FAR RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN IS FULFILLING THE 
BOOKMAKERS EXPECTATIONS HE IS IN 
THE FINAL BUT I WONDER HOW MANY 
PEOPLE HAVE MONEY ON ALI CARTER HER 
JOE PERRY THEY DEFIED THE ODDS SO 
FAR TO MAKE IT TO THE SEMI FINALS 
THIS IS THE BIGGEST GAME OF THEIR 
LIVES 
TWO WORLD CHAMPION TO KNOW ALL 
ABOUT THE PRESSURE JOHN PARROTT 
AND STEVE DAVIS WHAT DO YOU 
REMEMBER ABOUT YOUR FIRST SEMI 
FINAL FINAL ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT IS TOO LONG 
AGO AGO BUT WILL IT MEAN DO THESE TWO MEN 
HE PLAYED ALL YEAR LIFE TO GET TO 
THIS STAGE THERE WILL BE DESPERATE 
TO GET IN THE FINAL YOU PLAY ALL 
YOUR LIFE 
ALI CARTER TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE THE 
YOUNGEST PLAYER LEFT DID YOU HAVE 
BEEN MARKED DOWN AS A FUTURE WORLD 
CHAMPION CUE MARK ONE THINK HE 
PROBABLY CAME UNDER THE RAIDER 
I THINK HE PROBABLY CAME UNDER 
THE RAIDER 
JOE PERRY SEVENTEEN YEARS A PROFESSIONAL 
HE HAS MANAGED TO GET TO ONE FINAL 
IN THE PAST WHAT HAS CHANGED AND 
LED HIM 
HE IS A SLOW BURNER AND THE GAME 
EVERYONE HAD HIM DOWN AS A 
JOURNEYMAN BUT THIS CHANGES THE 
EQUATION EQUATION HE BEAT ME IN THE QUALIFIERS I 
HAVE GOT TO TAKE THE CREDIT FOR M. 
GREAT MATCH PLAYER 
GOOD ATTITUDE AT THE END HE 
SURPRISED ME AND MY MATCH BECAUSE 
HE PLAYED FANTASTIC SNOOKER AT EIGHT TO SEVEN 
DOWN HE LOOKS A PROPER TOURNAMENT 
PLAYER NOW 
THEY PLAYED THEIR SECOND SESSION 
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THIS IS HOW IT 
TURNED OUT 
IT WAS ALL SMILES BACKSTAGE BETWEEN 
THESE TWO GREAT MATES BUT ONCE 
THEY GET INTO THE ARENA IT WAS A 
DIFFERENT STORY 
JOE PERRY WOULD HAVE BEEN MISERABLE 
TO SEE THIS PINK GOING AS ALI 
CARTER WON THE TENTH ON THE BLACK 
CARTER WAS CUEING BEAUTIFULLY HE 
TOOK THE LEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
THE MATCH 
THAT WAS QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY A 
CENTURY 
THE CAPTAIN'S BRIDGE WAS IN PERFECT 
SHAPE AS HE STRETCHED HIS ADVANTAGE 
TO EIGHT TO FIVE JOE PERRY SEEMED TO BE 
STARING INTO THE ABYSS BUT SOMEHOW 
MANAGED TO STOP THE BLEEDING 
WINNING A SCRAPPY FOURTEENTH THEN OUT OF 
NOWHERE HE COMPILED A CLEARANCE OF 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN BUT ALI CARTER RESPONDED WITH 
A ONE RUN AT AND WHERE THE A 
CLEARANCE OF HIS AUNT EXHIBITION 
SHOTS AND ALL CLEARANCE OF HIS 
OWN 
ALI CARTER BEGAN THIS MORNING 
LEADING BY NINE TO SEVEN EIGHT MORE FRAMES 
TO PLAY THIS MORNING THIS IS THE 
FIRST OF THEM CLIVE EVERTON AND 
DENNIS TAYLOR ARE IN THE COMMENTARY 
BOX 
EVERYTHING SUFFERS FROM COMPARISON 
WITH HOW RONNIE A SON PLAYED 
YESTERDAY RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
YESTERDAY'S AFTERNOON SESSION 
BETWEEN THESE TWO WAS VERY GOOD BY 
ANY OTHER STANDARDS THE POT 
SUCCESS RATE FOR THE WHOLE MATCH 
NINETY ONE PER CENT FOR CARTER EIGHTY NINE PER CENT FOR JOE PERRY 
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SHOT TO 
NOTHING BUT CARTER CAUGHT IT SO 
THIN IT CANNONED ANOTHER BALL 
NOT THE SORT OF SHOT HE WAS HOPING 
FOR TO START THIS SESSION 
GOOD ANGLE TO BRING REDS INTO PLAY 
HE HAS GOT THE ONE NEAR THE MIDDLE 
POCKET AS LONG AS HE GETS PLENTY 
OF POWER INTO THIS HE SHOULD BE O. K. 
THAT RED IS GOING CLOSE TO THE 
MIDDLE THE WHITE IS GOING TO THE 
MIDDLE HE IS O. K. 
A GOOD START IS ALWAYS DESIRABLE 
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR PERRY 
THIS MORNING HE RESUMES TWO FRAMES 
BEHIND 
THAT FOURTEENTH FRAME WAS A BIG TURNING 
POINT IN THIS MATCH ALI CARTER WAS 
IN FINE FORM HE HAD WON SIX FRAMES 
IN A ROW AND WAS ON HIS WAY TO A 
SEVENTH HE HAD A BREAK OF SIXTY FOUR FIFTY ONE HE 
HAD ACTUALLY AND HE LOST THE FRAME 
ON THE BLACK THAT GOT JOE PERRY 
GOING AGAIN A LITTLE BIT OF ANGLE HE HAS HIT IT TOO HARD BAD MISJUDGEMENT 
THAT TYPE OF CLOTH THE CLOTH IS SO 
RESPONSIVE YOU ONLY HAVE TO TOUCH 
IT IT REALLY IS QUICK THIS CLOTH 
THE PLAYERS ARE PRODUCING SOME 
TERRIFIC SNOOKER ALI WOULD 
HAVE A 
GO AT 
THE RED 
INTO 
THIS RIGHT CORNER POCKET BUT HE IS 
LOOKING FOR THE SAFETY 
THAT SHOT IS GOING TO BE VERY 
AWKWARD INDEED FOR CARTER 
THE ONLY THING IS IT THE SENSE THE 
RED IN OFF THE BLACK HE MAY NOT BE 
ON THE PINK IF HE SENDS THE RED 
IN OF THE BLACK 
JUST STEADYING HIMSELF THAT IS THE 
BEST THING TO DO IF YOU'RE NOT 
COMPARABLE COMFORTABLE 
THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT SHOT IF 
CARTER HAD KNOCKED IT IN THERE WAS 
THE POSSIBILITY OF A SIZEABLE BREAK 
HE COULD HAVE LEFT SOMETHING EASIER 
THAN THIS WITH THE REDS SPREAD 
LIKE THAT ALI THOUGHT HE WOULD LET 
JOE RIGHT BACK IN THEM THERE IS 
ONLY ONE RED THAT WILL POT AT THE 
MOMENT 
IT IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD JUST YET 
UNTIL HE GETS THE PINK BACK ON ITS 
SPOT 
THAT WAS A CLEVER LITTLE SHOT HE 
TRIED TO NUDGE THE BLACK WAY PAST 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THAT INTO 
PLAY IF HE HAD HAVE JUST FLICKED 
THE BLACK IT WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED 
RED AND BLACK IF HE CAN GET OFF 
IF HE CAN GET ON THE PINK OFF THIS 
RED 
I'M JUST WONDERING IF THE PINK IS 
GOING TO BE TIED UP A LITTLE BIT A 
POOR POSITIONAL SHOT THERE FROM JOE 
HE HAS STILL GOT A POT ON 
THE PINK MAY BE AVAILABLE IN ONE OF 
THE TWO CORNER POCKETS 
AS I SAY 
HE PLAYED A POOR POSITIONAL SHOT 
THERE WAS A LOT OF ROOM BUT SOMEHOW 
OR OTHER ARE THE TAKES THIS POT 
ON AS HE STILL MIGHT DO THERE IS 
A SHOT ON 
IT IS A TOUGH SHOT BUT 
IF HE PUTS THE REDDEN AND CANONS 
THE OTHER RED HE WOULD BE ON THE 
PINK THAT IS NOT A BAD OPTION L. 
WOULD HAVE ADORED THIS HE IS 
PRETTY GOOD WITH THE REST HE 
DOESN'T LIKE IT 
ONE REASON FOR 
THAT IS THAT HE KNOWS FULL WELL 
THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON 
SOMETHING MUCH EASIER 
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER HE DID THE 
CANNON OR NOT IT WAS AN OPTION FOR 
HIM MAYBE HE DID TRY IT BUT JUST 
DIDN'T GET ENOUGH ON IT 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THERE WAS THAT 
THE POTTING ANGLE WAS RELATIVELY 
THIN IT WAS THEREFORE QUITE 
DIFFICULT TO MISS THE SECOND BALL 
THE ONE THAT HE IS LOOKING AT IS 
NOT THE EASIEST IF THE WHITE WAS 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE IT WOULD 
BE A SITTER FROM THIS ANGLE IT 
LOOKS AS IF IT IS COMFORTABLE POT BUT IT IS FAR FROM EASY SHE DID VERY WELL HE CUED IT 
THIS IS THE THIRD CHANCE THAT HE 
HAS HAD IN THIS FRIEND FRAME 
HE IS NOT SCORING THAT MANY OF THE 
POT BECAUSE HE HAS FINISHED ON THE 
YELLOW TWO OR THREE TIMES 
AS LONG 
AS HE KEEPS SPOTTING THEM THAT IS 
THE MAIN THING THE BLACK IS OUT OF 
COMMISSION STILL UNLESS HE CAN GET 
TO THIS RED NEAR THE BLACK BUT IT 
IS NOT AVAILABLE 
THIS WILL BE THE THIRD YELLOW IN 
THIS BREAK 
I WOULDN'T EVEN DREAM OF ASKING YOU 
WHAT THE RECORD IS FOUR REDS AND 
YELLOWS POTTED 
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T 
ASK ME BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW 
THAT WAS A HEAVY CONTACT HE STILL 
NEEDS A FEW MORE POTS THE 
POSITIONAL SHOT IS NOW MORE 
DIFFICULT HE HAS THREE REDS 
WAITING 
THE MIDDLE OF THE THREE IS THE ONE 
HE WILL BE ON 
SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM BUT THE CUE 
BALL IS LAW THAT HE INTENDED IT TO 
BE LOWER 
VILLA PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IF HE IS 
STRAIGHT HIM ON THE GROUND HE 
MIGHT AS WELL ALL THE BROWN AND 
THEN PLAYED BLACK THAT IS ALL HE 
CAN DO BECAUSE HE WOULD BE 
SNOOKERED ON THE OTHER RED THE FRAME IS FAIRLY SAFE NOW 
IT LOOKS AS IF PERRY HAS REDUCED 
HIS ARREARS TO NINE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT 
THIS REALLY HAS THE MAKINGS OF A 
VERY CLOSE RUN SEMI FINAL PERRY A 
MAN WHO HAS ALREADY DISPATCHED 
TOUGH COMPETITION ON ROUTE IS 
INCHING BACK TOWARDS ALI CARTER 
FREE EIGHTEEN FRAME 
THERE IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD SAFETY 
OFF THE END RED BUT THE LAST THING 
HE WANTS TO DO IS TO KNOCK THE 
BLACK SAFE LET'S SEE IF HE PLAYS 
ANOTHER ONE TO GET BACK DOWN THE 
TABLE HE DID 
LAST THING FOR PLAYERS WANT IS TO 
SEE THE BLACK GOING SAFE EARLY ON 
IN THE FRAME THE LAST THING THE 
PLAYERS 
CARTER HAS NEVER REACHED A FINAL ON 
THE TOUR ONLY TWO SEMI FINALS 
BERRY HAS REACHED ONE FINAL AND TWO 
SEMI FINALS PERRY TO BE 
INVOLVED AT THIS STAGE OF THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP IS A LOT MORE THAN 
EITHER OF THEM WOULD HAVE EXPECTED 
A FEW WEEKS AGO 
OF COURSE ALI 
CARTER WAS INVOLVED IN A LITTLE BIT 
OF SNOOKER HISTORY MAKING THE 
SECOND MAXIMUM BREAK THE THE INTERESTING THING WAS THAT HE SAID 
IN A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT HE HAD 
ALWAYS DREAMT OF DOING IT BUT FELT 
THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO IF HE 
GOT THE CHANCE WHICH SHOWED A 
SLIGHT LACK OF SELF CONFIDENCE 
THE LAST BLACK HE KNOCKED IN THAT 
MAXIMUM BLADE MAXIMUM BREAK BUT 
WHITE WAS OVER ON THE CUSHION YOU 
COULD HAVE NOT GOT A BIGGER 
PRESSURE SHOT HE PUT THE BLACK 
RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF THE POCKET 
THE CELEBRATIONS QUITE SOMETHING 
WERE QUITE COULDN'T AVOID THE CANNON 
DIDN'T DROP TOO BADLY ON THE GROUND 
BROWN 
A BIT OF A HEAVY CONTACT THERE HE 
CAN SCREW BACK AND GET ANOTHER RED CAN HE GET THROUGH FOR THE BLACK 
SHOULD BE O. K. THIS TIME HE'S GOING 
TO HAVE TO GET THE CANNON BECAUSE 
THEY'RE ALL TALKING EACH OTHER 
BALKING BLOCKING 
HE WANTED TO MISS THAT RED IF HE 
HIT THE OTHER TWO HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN PERFECT 
HE DID WANT TO MISS THAT ROUTE 
RED BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO 
COMPROMISE THE PLOT BY USING THE 
LEFT HAND SIDE POT 
THAT'S A USEFUL BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE 
THERE 
NOT EASY TO LAND ON A RED AND LEAVE 
IT SAFE HE CAN'T GET TO THE RED ON 
THE OTHER SIDE THE WAY THE REDS 
ARE BUNCHED HE HAS TO BE VERY 
CAREFUL 
A ABOVE ALL HE DID NOT WANT TO 
HIT THAT TOO HARD BUT HE GOT THE 
RIGHT WINE LYSINE LINE 
HE JUST WANTS TO LAND ON THAT RED 
IF HE LANDS ON THE ONE TO THE RIGHT 
HE COULD LEAVE THE LINE ON 
IF HE HAD HIT THAT ANY HARDER HE 
WOULD HAVE LEFT THIS AN EASY POT 
HE IS BETTER OFF HITTING THE ONE 
THAT IS NEITHER AS THE BLACK 
NEWEST NEWEST AND MOST NEAR 
AROUND OF APPLAUSE BUT THAT IS NOT 
THE RED HE WAS TRYING TO LAND ON 
A ROUND 
THIS IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE NOW FOR 
JOE PERRY 
IT COULD VERY EASILY BE NINE FRAMES 
ALL IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES' TIME 
HE WARNED RISK GOING INTO THOSE TWO 
RENTS THE RATHER FOUR AROUND THE 
PINK YOU DO NOT WANT TO PLAY A 
CANNON AT THIS STAGE PLENTY OF ROOM AROUND THE PINK 
VERY METHODICAL WHEN HE IS IN CLOSE 
HIS CLOSE CONTROL IS USUALLY PRETTY 
GOOD AT THINK HE HAS OVER SCREWED THIS 
THAT WAS THE BALL HE WAS LOOKING 
FOR HE STILL NEEDS ANOTHER ONE THIS RED GIVES IN THE FRAME HIM 
JOE PERRY HAS DONE EXACTLY WHAT HE 
SET OUT TO DO WHEN THE FIRST TWO 
FRAMES OF THE MORNING WIN 
WITH THAT FIFTY SEVEN BREAK JOE PERRY 
LEVELLED THE MATCH AT NINE ALL 
THAT UNHURRIED MEASURED STYLE ON 
THE TABLE SUDDENLY THEY'RE ALL 
LEVEL AGAIN WHAT HAS BEEN THE MOST 
IMPRESSIVE FACET OVER THE WAY THAT 
JOE PERRY HAS PLAYED 
AT YOU HAVE 
HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD HE IS 
CALM AND COOL AND COLLECTED HE HAS 
HAD TOUGH MATCHES TOUGH MOMENTS IN 
THE MATCHES HE HAS COPED WITH THEM 
ADMIRABLY HE HAS BEEN FRONT AND 
IN FRONT AND IN BEHIND IT DOES NOT 
HAPPEN OFTEN THAT THERE IS SUCH A 
STORY THAT IS THE GREAT THING 
ABOUT LONG MATCHES JO LOOKS LIKE A 
MAN ON A MISSION L. THINK THAT IS 
PROBABLY ABOUT IT 
HE LOOKS VERY ON 
RUSHED VERY PLACID 
GOOD RHYTHM A 
GOOD TEMPO CONCENTRATING PROPERLY 
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY GOOD 
PLAYER HE IS NOW LOOKING A LITTLE 
BIT HIGHER THAN THAT HE IS LOOKING 
VERY COMFORTABLE 
THE EFFORTS OF 
BOTH MEN HAVE HELPED THEIR CAREER 
PROSPECTS BECAUSE LET US TAKE A 
LOOK AT THE PROVISIONAL TOP SIXTEEN 
RANKINGS THE COMPLICATIONS OF THE 
TOP SIXTEEN ARE ALWAYS AMUSING THIS IS 
WHERE THEY STAND JOE PERRY INTO 
THE SIXTEENTH FOR THE THIRD TIME IN HIS 
CAREER AT NUMBER TWELVE AND ALI CARTER 
UP TO NO TEN IF THEY GOT TO THE 
FINAL EITHER OF THEM THEN ALI 
WOULD GO TO NUMBER SEVEN AND JOE 
WOULD STAY WHERE HE IS IF EITHER 
OF THEM WERE TO WIN THIS CARTER 
WOULD BE WORLD NO SIX AND PERRY 
WOULD BE WORLD NO SEVEN THOSE OTHER 
NAVIES WHAT IS SET AND IT IS THAT 
WE HAVE FOUR NEW PLAYERS IN THE TOP 
SIXTEEN MANY PEOPLE DELIGHTED TO SEE 
MARK ALLEN IN 
HE WAS PARTICULARLY 
UPSET TO LOSING WITH LOSING TO 
STEPHEN HENDRY THE CHANCE TO GO ON 
AND DO WELL AND THE TOURNAMENT IT 
LOOKS LIKE HE HAD LOST HIS TOP SIXTEEN 
PLACE HE WILL BE VERY RELIEVED 
INCIDENTALLY MARK KING AND JOE 
PERRY AND MARCO FU HAVE ALTOGETHER 
MADE HISTORY BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL 
BACK INTO THE TOP SIXTEEN FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN THEIR CAREERS I SHOULD 
ALSO MENTION THAT GOING OUT WILL BE 
A CERTAIN STEVE DAVIS BUT YOU WILL 
BE BACK 
I HAVE BEEN OUT BEFORE I 
POPPED OUT AND CAME BACK THIS TIME 
IT COULD BE HARDER THE LINE UP IN 
THE TOP SIXTEEN IS GETTING HARDER THE 
CHALLENGE IS THERE TO GET BACK IN 
ALSO YOU GET A BIT MORE MATCHPLAY 
OUTSIDE THE TOP SIXTEEN AND YOU HAVE TO 
MAKE UP FOR THAT IF YOU'RE IN THEIR 
TOP SIXTEEN IF THE SEASON GOES WRONG 
YOU COME IN AT THE LATTER STAGES 
AND PLAY AGAINST PLAYERS THAT ARE 
HUNGRY AND HAD SOME MATCHES BEFORE 
THEY GET TO YOU YOU CAN GET CAUGHT 
COLD IT IS A TOUGH AREA TO BE IN 
IT WILL BE FASCINATING BECAUSE IT 
IS NOT JUST YOURSELF MATT STEPHENS 
KEN DOHERTY MARK WILLIAMS A A FANTASTIC TOURNAMENT ON HOUR ON 
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO FOR THE NEXT 
SEASON I'M SURE WE WILL SEE YOU 
BACK LET US GET BACK INTO THIS 
NINE ALL LET US GET INTO THE NEXT 
FRAME 
SURELY HE HASN'T LEFT HIS RED TO 
THE LEFT CORNER SOMETIMES THAT 
LITTLE SHOT CAN DRIFT SLIGHTLY I'M 
JUST WONDERING IF THE PINK IS NOT 
AVAILABLE HE WOULD HAVE TO SCREW 
BLACK BACK TOWARDS THE BLUE A A TEST OF CUEING WHAT IS THE RED 
GOING WHERE IS L. THINK HE HAS BEEN VERY LUCKY WHAT A RESULT PERFECTLY SAFE 
I'M SURE HE IS PRACTICE THAT SHOT 
UP MANY TIMES 
BUT IN THE MATCH 
YOU ONLY GET ONE TRY 
I DIDN'T SPOT THAT ONE BUT JOE 
OBVIOUSLY DID 
I DIDN'T SEE HIM COMING ROUND THE 
TABLE TO LOOK AT THE PLANT 
NEVERTHELESS HE IS IN AMONGST THEM 
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO GET INTO THAT SO 
SHARPLY HE INTENDED TO BE ABOVE 
THE BLUE 
DEBATING WHETHER TO HAVE A GO AT 
THE BLACK OR NOT 
IT IS AN EASY 
BLUE BUT HE HAS TO GET AROUND THE 
TABLE HE WOULD LOVE TO GET ON THE 
RED THAT IS NEAR THE BLACK AND THE 
PINK IS AVAILABLE THE RED HE HAS 
TO BE CAREFUL OF THE RED 
NOT GREAT 
IT MIGHT BE THE END OF 
THE BREAK HE IS NOT GOING TO 
CAPITALISE ON THAT PLANT 
ALL THIS BECAUSE JOE PERRY DIDN'T 
GET UP OF THE BLUE COUPLE OF 
SHOTS AGO ABOVE THE BLUE THE THE AIR HE WAS HAVING A LOOK TO SEE IF 
THE PLANT WAS ON THIS WAS THE 
EXECUTION JUST PAST THE BLACK 
IT SHOULD HAVE LED TO A SUBSTANTIAL 
BREAK BUT IT HAS NOT 
THIS RED IS A POSSIBILITY HE IS 
PLAYING THE SAFETY SHOT 
HE HAS HIT IT FAR TOO THIN HE HAS 
LEFT THE RED HE HAS TRIED TO CUT IN 
THAT IS A MISTAKE 
SO A CHANCE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL 
PROGRESS TOWARDS REGAINING THE LEAD 
TEN TO NINE 
SPREAD OVER YESTERDAY AND TODAY 
PERRY HAS WON FOUR OF THE LAST FIVE 
FRAMES 
HE WON THE THREE OPENING FRAMES OF 
THE MATCH AND NOW HE IS ON HIS WAY 
TO WINNING TWO FRAMES AT THE START 
OF THIS SESSION HE HAS QUITE A FEW 
BALLS TO POT BUT HE IS IN IT OR 
BUT HE IS IN THE DRIVING SEAT AT 
THE MOMENT 
AT THE END OF THE FOURTEENTH FRAME JOE 
PERRY PINCHED IT WENT OUT OF THE 
ARENA ALI CARTER WAS IN HIS SEAT 
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS IF TO SAY THAT 
HE HAD MISSED A CHANCE HE COULD 
HAVE BEEN NINE TO FIVE AHEAD 
CREDIT TO PARIS HE STILL HAD TO 
PRODUCE SPECTACULAR POSITIONAL 
SHOT TO PINK FROM BLACK THAT 
STARTED HIS REVIVAL 
YOU HAVE TO PUT THAT DOWN AS ONE OF 
THE SHOT OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP HE 
WENT ON TO MAKE A BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN 
NOT MUCH AVAILABLE NOW THREE REDS 
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TABLE ONE 
OF THEM IS POSSIBLE THE OTHER TWO 
AT BIT DIFFICULT THESE TWO ARE 
PUSHING BEHIND THE PINK THE OTHER TWO ARE A BIT DIFFICULT 
HE SEEMS TO BE PRETTY GOOD WITH THE 
REST AND NOW THERE I HAVE SAID 
THAT HE WILL PROBABLY MISS 
PLAYED PERFECTLY AND HE HAS AN 
ANGLE TO DEVELOP THE REDS 
PERRY HAS POTTED THREE QUARTERS OF 
HIS REST SHOT AS HAS CARTER 
HE HAS PLAYED THAT WELL LOOK WHERE 
HE HAS PLACED THE CUE BALL HE HAS 
LEFT HIM SO THE CHOICE OF REDS HE 
HAS A RED TO THE MIDDLE RED TO THE 
CORNER A SUPERB POSITIONAL SHOT FOR FRAME BALL IN EFFECT 
HE DID NOT WANT TO RISK THE CANNON 
PREVIOUSLY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT 
GUARANTEE TO GET GOOD POSITION ON 
THE CANNON GUARANTEED 
JOE PERRY WINS HIS THIRD 
CONSECUTIVE FRAME TO REGAIN THE 
LEAD AT TEN TO NINE HE HAS RESTRICTED ALI 
CARTER TO A MERE NINE POINTS 
IT IS AMAZING THE NUMBER OF TIMES 
THE PLAYERS ARE LEAVING THIS POT ON 
WILL 
THAT WAS ON THE THIN SIDE THAT WAS ON THE THIN SIDE SOMEONE SOMEONE JUST COUGHED NOT INTENTIONALLY 
AND JOE WANTED TO STOP 
CARTER NEEDS TO MAKE AN IMPACT SOON 
HE HAS TOTALLED ONLY NINE POINTS IN 
THE THREE FRAMES PLAYED THIS 
MORNING 
YOU HAVE TO FORGET ABOUT MORNING THE SCORE LINE AND JUST PLAY THE 
SEMI FINAL FROM NOW 
THERE IS NO EASY PATH AROUND THE 
TABLE THIS IS WHAT HE IS LOOKING 
AT THAT IS A POSSIBILITY BUT THERE 
IS NO COLOUR AVAILABLE STOP THE 
BLACK IS TIED UP HE MAY HAVE TO 
POT HIMSELF OUT OF TROUBLE IF YOU 
CANNOT SEE A SAFETY SHOT YOU MIGHT 
AS WELL GOAL FOR THE POT GO HE 
WAS CLOSE HAS HE GOT AWAY WITH IT 
NOT QUITE L. THOUGHT WHEN HE 
FLICKED THE RED HE WAS GOING TO GET 
AWAY WITH IT JUST WATCH WHAT 
HAPPENS TO THE WHITE 
HERE IT 
PICKS 
UP THE RED THE RED CAME UP WITH 
THE CUE BALL 
HE NEEDS AN EASY ONE TO GET GOING 
IT THOUGHT HE WOULD POT THAT A 
LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE CREEPING IN 
NOW 
PERRY WILL BE DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE 
MISSED THAT TO HAVE MISSED THAT 
WHERE EITHER OF THESE PLAYERS GET 
IN FRONT THEY SEEM TO BE OVER 
ANXIOUS TO PRESS ON WHENEVER IT IT IS THE BIGGEST MATCH IN THEIR 
CAREER FIGHTING AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THEATRE TO GET THROUGH TO THE FINAL 
THE LONGER THE MATCH GOES ON HE 
WILL GET A FEW MISTAKES BECAUSE OF 
THE OCCASION EVEN THE PEOPLE ON 
THE BACK ROW GET A GOOD U. HERE 
THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE PLAYING FOR 
IT IS QUITE AN ELITE CLUB TO GIVE 
YOUR NAME ON THAT TROPHY TWENTY ONE 
WINNERS IN OVER SEVENTY YEARS 
AND JOE 
DAVIS HELD ON DEFEATED FOR THE 
FIRST TWENTY YEARS UNDEFEATED IT 
WAS NOT PLAYED BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY ONE AND 
NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
THE VERY FIRST MATCH EVER PLAYED IN 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP TWO OLD BILLIARD 
PLAYERS IT TOOK ONE WEEK NOT 
BECAUSE THEY WERE SLOW PLAYERS BUT 
BECAUSE THEY ONLY PLAYED TWO OR 
THREE FRAMES AT A BEACH IN SESSIONS 
OF IT BILLIARDS MATCH TWO OR 
THREE FRAMES AND THEY BETWEEN 
SESSIONS OF A BILLIARDS MATCH 
THE GREAT WALTON IN FROM PLAYED AT 
BUCKINGHAM PALACE CLIVE WAS IT 
FOR GEORGE THE SIXTH 
HE DID PLAY 
THERE QUITE A FEW OF THE OLD 
BILLIARDS PLAYERS DID 
THAT WAS AN ERROR BUT NOT QUITE AS 
SERIOUS AND THEY'RE AS CARTER WAS 
HOPING FOR 
KURTA CAN'T GET ANY EASIEST BACK 
CARTER CANNOT GET AN EASY STARTER 
ONCE HE KISSED THAT RED JOE 
THO UGHT HE WOULD HAVE LEFT 
SOMETHING EASY FOR ALI BUT HE HAS 
NOT 
HE JUST CANNOT GET GOING PERRY'S PERRY'S MISTAKE COST HIM NOTHING 
THE SORT OF SHOT HE WOULD HAVE 
POTTED HAD HE BEEN UP AND RUNNING 
AND IN THE GROOVE 
STRAIGHT DOWN THE HEART OF THE 
POCKET 
PERRY HAS WON FIVE OF THE LAST SIX 
FRAMES 
YOU'RE CERTAINLY GROWING IN 
CONFIDENCE WHEN YOU NOT THAT KIND 
OF SHOT IN 
PLAY SUCH BIG PART IN THE GAME OF 
SNOOKER ANY TIME JOE MAKES 
MISTAKE HE SEEMS TO BE GETTING AWAY 
WITH IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT DOES 
NOT HAVE MICHIE FEEL GOOD WHAT 
YOUR OPPONENT DOES NOT THINK TOO 
MUCH ABOUT IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS 
IT DOES NOT HALF MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD 
WITH SNOOKER IT THE BIT OF LUCK 
GOES YOUR WAY WITH AN INITIAL SHOT 
YOU CAN SOMETIMES GO ON FROM IT AND 
WIN THE FRAME IN A SPORT LIKE 
TENNIS YOU WIN A LUCKY POINT AND 
YOU HAVE JUST ONE THAT ONE POINT 
THE NEXT POINT START FROM SCRATCH 
I DID NOT REALISE YOU WERE SO GOOD 
AT TENNIS DID YOU ALMOST GET TO 
PLAY AT WIMBLEDON WHEN YOU WERE 
YOUNG YOUNG ADDED PLAY AT WIMBLEDON QUALIFYING 
A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN IT WAS A LOT 
EASIER TO GET INTO THAT I DID 
PLAY IT WAS A LOT EASIER TO GET 
INTO IT AND IT IS NOW 
HE IS HAVING TO WORK VERY HARD FOR 
THESE BECAUSE OF THE RED CONGESTED 
AROUND THE BLACK 
JILL LOOKED A LITTLE ANXIOUS THERE 
HE GOT THE CUE BALL WAS GOING IN 
GILL 
PRETTY GOOD LENGTH ONCE AGAIN ALI 
CARTER FACED WITH VERY DIFFICULT 
SITUATION IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT A 
SLIGHT BIT OF ANGLE ON THAT RED 
BUT HE HAS GOT TO TRY TO MAKE 
SOMETHING HAPPEN 
IT WAS A VERY GOOD POT BUT IT WAS 
GREAT AND HE TRIED TO JUST PINCH 
LITTLE BIT IT WAS STRAIGHT 
SOMETIMES WITH AS GREAT POT IF THE 
OBJECT BALL GOES IN ONE SIDE OF THE 
POCKET RATHER THAN THE OTHER IT 
CAN GO IN OFF NOTHING MUCH GOING 
FOR CARTER AT THE MOMENT 
THIS IS HER CHANCE HE CAN DROP 
THIS RED IN AND HE WILL BE ON THE 
BLACK THIS WILL BE THE FIRST CHANT 
ALI CARTER HAS HAD IN THIS SESSION 
SO FAR GIVING HIMSELF TELLING OFF 
PERFECT LITTLE CANNON ONTO THE RED 
THAT WOULD DEVELOP THE THE TWO REDS 
AND THE CHANCE TO GET BACK INTO 
THIS FINAL FRAME BEFORE THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL 
THE INITIAL RED WAS CARTER'S FIRST 
POT FOR TWENTY SIX MINUTES 
IT JUST COMPLICATES THINGS SLIGHTLY 
HE CAN STILL SCREW BACK A LITTLE 
BIT AND LEAD TO THAT MIGHT LEAVE 
THE RED TO THE CORNER HE CAN PICK HIS ANGLE FOR THIS RED 
THAT IS TERRIBLE CUEING FROM ALI 
THERE HE WANTED TO BE STRAIGHTER 
ON THE PINK BUT STILL THAT IS IN A 
POOR SHOT AND IT WILL HURT HE HAS 
MISSED IT BY QUITE A WAY 
I THINK HE MAY GO ON THE PRACTICE 
TABLE WITH TERRY GRIFFITHS IN THE 
MID SESSION INTERVAL LEE ALI 
VERY LIKELY BUT I THINK EVEN MORE 
VALUABLE WILL BE WHAT TERRY GRIP 
ASKED TO SAY TO HIM TERRY 
GRIFFITHS ASKED TO SAY TO HIM 
THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO THIS 
MATCH THE FIRST TO SEVENTEEN FRAMES 
TERRY BUT IT HAS BEEN IN OF HERE 
TERRY GRIFFITHS HAS BEEN HERE AND 
OF TIMES IN SELL YOU TELL HIM TO 
FORGET THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
HIMSELF HE HAS A CHOICE OF REDS 
TWENTY SEVEN IN FRONT WORKING OUT HOW MANY 
REDS HE NEEDS 
THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM THE GREEN 
IS HAMPERING HIM 
THAT IS A POOR SHOT FROM JOE PERRY 
IT WAS NOTHING LIKE WHAT HE 
ATTEMPTED 
THE CUE BALL WAS GOING NOWHERE IN 
THAT DIRECTION 
THE SHOT YOU MENTIONED HE MISHIT 
IT COMPLETELY HE WAS PLAYING WITH 
A LOT OF BOTTOM AND RIGHT HAND SIDE JOE PERRY NEEDS RED COLOUR RED THAT IS A TERRIFIC SHOT 
PLAYED IT A LITTLE HORRIDLY THERE 
ALI HORRIDLY 
HE WILL BE GLAD TO GET TO THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL TO SORT OUT IF HE 
THINKS TO SORT OUT FEW THINGS 
THE NEXT RED SECURES A TWO FRAME 
LEAD 
GO AND THIS FRAME MAKES IT SIX OUT 
OF SEVEN FOR PERRY FROM EIGHT TO FIVE DOWN 
THIS FRAME 
MR. CARTER HAS SCORED ONLY TWENTY FOUR POINTS 
IN THE FOUR FRAMES WE HAVE SEEN 
TODAY TODAY THIS MATCH REALLY IS EBBING AND 
FLOWING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE 
WAY THAT JOE HAS MANAGED TO ASSERT 
HIMSELF 
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HIS HIMSELF COMPOSURE BUT HE ALSO HAS A 
DISTINCTIVE CUE ACTION HE DOES NOT 
MAKE A LOT OF PREPARATORY MOVEMENTS 
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BUT WHEN 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO 
CONTROL THE CUE YOU HAVE TO BE IN 
CONTROL ALL THE TIMES NOT JUST THE 
DELIVERY WHICH IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT PART PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT 
THAT BUT TO BE IN CONTROL OF THE 
CUE AND DELIVER IT PROPERLY YOU 
ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE PULLBACK HE 
HAS ONE OF THE MOST TO LEVET 
PULLBACKS A LOT OF PLAYERS PULL 
BACK QUITE QUICKLY ONE OF THE 
MOST DELIBERATE JOE PERRY IS VERY 
SLOW BACK TOTALLY IN CONTROL A 
LONG PAUSE AT THE BACK AND THEN HE 
DELIVERS 
IT IS A LANGUID CUE DELIVERS ACTION RATHER THAN A CRISP 
DECISIVE ONE 
IT IS NOT LANGUID IT 
IS JUST VERY VERY UNDER CONTROL 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS 
ALI CARTER NEEDS 
TO GET GOING AT THE MINUTE HE HAS 
LOST HIS GAME HE NEEDS A GOOD 
CHANCE TO GET HIMSELF BACK IN IT 
RATHER LIKE JOE AS YOU SAID ED 
AND FLOW THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS 
MATCH HAS BEEN ED AND FLOW 
OUR HOST CITY OF SHEFFIELD HAS BEEN 
SYNONYMOUS WITH SNOOKER IT IS THE 
HOME OF THE SPORT WE ARE HERE 
QUITE A LOT ON TRACK AND FIELD 
BUSINESS ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER 
IT WAS AT AN ATHLETICS MEETING HERE 
IN SHEFFIELD A FEW YEARS AGO THAT 
DAYNE KELLY HOLMES CALL TIME ON HER 
ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER AFTER WINNING 
TWO GOLD MEDALS AT THE ATHENS 
OLYMPICS SHE STILL RETAINS GREAT 
DEAL OF AFFECTION FOR SNOOKER AND 
THIS CITY 
MY NAN AND GRANDDAD ALWAYS WATCHED 
SNOOKER I USED ALWAYS GO ROUND 
THEIR HOUSE WITHOUT A DOUBT THERE 
WOULD BE STICKER ON T. V. IT IS 
EXACTLY THE SAME AS WELL DONE 
MACRO ODD YEARS AGO WHAT SHOULD 
I SAY TWENTY ODD YEARS AGO THEY ARE 
GLUED TO THE SET MIGHT TRY AND 
GET MY GRANDAD SOME TICKETS FOR 
THIS YEAR ABSOLUTELY HAVING BEEN 
AN ATHLETE COMPETING AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL PEOPLE THINK YOU ARE 
PREPARED FOR ANYTHING PEOPLE 
THINK YOU ARE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING 
BELIEVE ME YOU 
ARE SO 
FOCUSED ON 
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO BUT ULTIMATELY 
THERE IS THE UNKNOWN AHEAD OF YOU 
AND EVEN 
THOUGH YOU 
HAVE PRACTISED 
AND YOU HAVE 
GONE TO 
EDGE YOU 
COMPETED SO MANY TIMES WHEN IT 
COMES TO SOMETHING THAT IS SO 
IMPORTANT TO YOU THERE IS NO 
TURNING BACK WALKING DOWN THOSE 
STAIRS IS PROBABLY A BIT OF 
ADRENALIN EXCITEMENT NERVES BUT 
ULTIMATELY THEY KNOW IT COULD BE 
AN OUTCOME THEY HAVE WANTED ALL 
THEIR LIVES 
ALL SPORT IS SO DIFFERENT 
OBVIOUSLY BEING AN ATHLETE YOU 
CANNOT CONTROL WHAT THE OTHER 
ATHLETES TO EITHER YOU HAVE YOUR 
GAME PLAN AND YOU RUN IF YOU RUN 
AT EIGHT HUNDRED METRES YOU DO NOT LET OTHER 
PEOPLE GET IN YOUR WAY AND SPOIL IT 
FOR YOU IN SNOOKER IT YOU HAVE 
THE BALLS THEY ARE YOU OPPOSITION 
AS WELL YOU CANNOT CONTROL THEM 
ALL THE TIME YOU HOPE THAT YOU 
HAVE GOT 
YOU HOPE 
YOU HAVE GOT 
YOUR TACTICS 
RIGHT 
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN FOR SNOOKER PLAYER TO 
THERE AND SOMETIMES KNOW THAT THERE 
IS SOMETHING THERE IS NOTHING 
THEY CAN DO IT MUST BE VERY HARD 
TO TAKE IT'S HIS PHYSICAL AS WELL 
AS PSYCHOLOGICAL THAT MUST BE VERY 
HARD HARD TACTICAL BATTLES 
I WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE A BIG BREAKS 
GOAL 
NO I LIKE THE TACTICAL SIDE GOAL OF IT L. THINK MY FORTE WAS TACTICS 
AT RUNNING L. DID NOT ALWAYS LEAD 
FROM THE FRONT I CAME FROM THE 
BACK TACTICS 
HOME GOODNESS IT IS HARD TO 
BELIEVE IT IS FOR YEARS AND SHE WON 
THOSE FOUR GOLD TWO GOLD MEDALS 
INTERESTING INSIGHT FROM KELLY INTO 
SNOOKER WASN'T IT 
TO SOME DEGREE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE PERFORMED SO HIGHLY 
IN SPORT EVEN IF IT IS NOT THE 
SAME SPORT WON HIS ATHLETIC ONE 
IS A MIND GAME SO TO SPEAK THEY 
DO HAVE AN INSIGHT IT IS 
FASCINATING TO SEE THE INSIDES 
THAT WAS GOOD L. ENJOYED IT SHE SHE DID POT IN HERE A FEW YEARS AGO 
SHE HAD SOME TEN COACHING LESSONS 
FROM KEN DOHERTY 
IF SHE WAS 
STRAIGHT OUT 
SHE WAS EXACTLY 
ANYWAY LET US GET BACK INTO THE 
SEMI FINAL PERRY HAS RE 
ESTABLISHED AN ELEVEN NINE FRAME LEAD ELEVEN TO NINE 
PLAY RESUMES AFTER THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL PERRY LEADS ELEVEN TO NINE HAVING 
WON SIX OF THE LAST SEVEN FRAMES 
SPREAD OVER YESTERDAY AND TODAY 
EACH SEPARATE HALF SESSION IS A 
KIND OF A NEW START CARTER 
CERTAINLY NEEDS TO MAKE IT A NEW 
START FOR HIM HE HAS NOT BEEN IN 
CONTENTION IN ANY OF THE FOUR 
FRAMES PLAYED THIS MORNING PERRY 
HAS BEEN STEADY AND PRETTY SOLID 
BUT NO MORE 
WELL ALI HAS PLAYED A 
VERY GOOD SAFETY THERE IT IS NOT 
STRAIGHT FORWARD THIS SHOT THAT 
JOE IS LOOKING AT HE HAS TO AVOID 
THE CANNON ON TO THE RED AND PLAY 
WITH A TOUCH OF SIDE AND MISS THE 
DOUBLE KICK ON THE WAY BACK DOWN 
HE ALMOST CAUGHT THAT RED ON THE 
WAY BACK 
THAT 
IS A GOOD SHOT IT IT IS A VERY VERY GOOD SHOT SO CLOSE TO DOUBLE KISSING THE RED 
WE WERE TALKING PRIOR TO THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL ABOUT TERRY 
GRIFFITHS'S CARTER'S COACH 
HAVING A FEW WORDS WITH HIM 
GRIFFITHS IS ALSO PERRY'S COACH 
YES THEY ARE BOTH WITH THE SAME 
COACHING COMPANY TERRY IS 
AVAILABLE TO THE PLAYERS THAT ARE 
WITH THEM HE USED TO BE WITH 
STEPHEN HENDRY MARK WILLIAMS MARK 
LEFT AND THEN WENT BACK TO THEM 
ALL THE PLAYERS WITH THAT TEAM 
THAT COACHING COMPANY HAVE ACCESS 
TO HIM 
WHO IS HE CHEERING FOR CLIVE DO 
YOU KNOW 
WELL HE WOULD BE 
SCRUPULOUS SCRUPULOUSLY IMPARTIAL 
I'M SURE 
THE BLACK HAS REBOUNDED AND NOT 
VERY FAVOURABLY O. K. HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN LUCKY TO HAVE FINISHED ON THE 
BLACK BUT HE WAS IN WHOLE THERE 
ALL THAT WAS LEFT FROM THE PLANT 
JUST A PLANT THE PLANT ITSELF WAS 
NOT A CONVENTIONAL BECAUSE IT WAS 
NOT RED ON TO READ IT WAS RED ONTO 
BLACK ONTO RED 
IF THE BLACK HAD 
BEEN A BIT NEARER ITS SPOT HE 
COULD HAVE GOT THROUGH IT GOT HIM 
OUT OF A TIGHT SPOT 
TALKING ABOUT TIGHT SPOTS JOE 
PERRY IS IN ONE NOW HE CANNOT GET 
BETWEEN BLUE AND PINK TO GET TO THE 
REDS THERE HE NEEDS TO GET TO THE 
RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE PINK THAT 
IS NOT AVAILABLE TO HIM WITH THE 
TWO CUSHION GET OUT HE WILL HAVE 
TO BE SO PRECISE 
BETTER TO MISS THEM ALL TOGETHER 
WITH THE FIRST ATTEMPT AND THEN TRY 
TO READJUST ALI CARTER WILL HAVE 
THIS REPLACED 
THE PLAYERS A VERY FAIR MINDED I 
R. THE PLAYERS ARE VERY FAIR 
MINDED IT IS VERY RARE TO SEE A 
SQUABBLE HE JUST NEEDS A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT 
A BIT VAGUE BUT HAS HE COVERED 
EVERYTHING FAKE L. THINK HE IS 
O. K. A BIT THICK ALL BLOCKING 
EACH OTHER 
THIS MIGHT CUT IN PLAYING THE 
SAFETY SHOT 
IT WOULD BE A SAFETY SHOT BUT HE 
WOULD GET CLOSE TO THE POT HERE 
IT'S A IS THERE IT IS THERE NOW 
A CHANCE TO PUT JOE BACK IN TROUBLE 
AGAIN TIED UP BEHIND THE YELLOW 
THIS IS NOT AN EASY ONE THE ONE 
YOU WOULD BE LOOKING TO LAND ON IS 
THE RED NEAREST THE BACK CUSHION 
HERE BUT YOU CANNOT SEE 
AN EASY 
WAY THROUGH TO THAT ONE ALL THE 
AVENUES SEEM TO BE BLOCKED OFF 
HE WOULD LIKE TO MAYBE LAND ON THE 
TWO REDS NEAR THE LEFT CORNER 
POCKET BUT TO STRIKE OVER THE 
YELLOW FROM THAT DIFFERENCE 
DISTANCE HE WOULD NEED A LONG 
SPIDER AND THAT IS 
WHAT HE 
IS 
LOOKING 
AT BUT 
THAT IS GOING TO BE 
SO DIFFICULT ALSO HE HAS GOT A BIG 
PROBLEM HERE WELL IF HE CAN COPE 
TWICE ACROSS THE TABLE HE MIGHT BE 
LOOKING TO LAND ON THE RED I 
MENTIONED IF HE CAN GO L. AM NOT 
SURE NO I DON'T THINK HE CAN 
MAKE THAT ANGLE HE NEEDED A BIT OF LUCK THERE 
THERE WAS ONLY A MISSABLE SHORT 
RANGE CUT BACK RED ON 
YOU ARE NOW DOES THIS CODE IN 
QUESTION MARK NOW DOES THIS CUT 
IN 
EVEN IF HE CAN CUT IT IN HE IS NOT 
SURE WHERE THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO 
FINISH 
THAT IS THE ONE HE IS LOOKING AT 
THE WHITE WILL BE PICKING UP PACE 
HERE HE MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO GET 
OVER BEHIND 
THE BROWN HERE OH HE HAS GONE A 
BIT THIN THAT 
WAS NOT THE 
SHOT HE 
BIT THIN THAT WAS NOT THE SHOT HE WAS LOOKING FOR THAT IS A POSSIBILITY BUT JOE 
SHOT 
BACK 
LOOKING AT 
THIS RED AND THE 
SAFETY SHOT 
HE WANTS 
TO KEEP THE 
LIT IT THE PRESSURE ON 
CUE BALL OVER THE AWKWARD 
CONGESTED SIDE OF THE TABLE THERE THERE IS END ESCAPE A THIN ONE OFF THAT 
WOULD GET 
HIM BACK UP THE TABLE 
WOULD GET HIM BACK UP THE TABLE THERE 
IS AN 
ESCAPE HE 
MIGHT 
GO CLOSE 
TO CUTTING IT INTO THE 
GO CLOSE TO CUTTING IT INTO THE POCKET 
HE DID PLAY THAN ONE AND DIDN'T HE 
PLAY IT WELL THAT ONE 
HE'LL PLAY A SNOOKER AGAIN AND HE 
PLAYED IT PERFECTLY 
TIED UP BEHIND PERRY CANNOT GET TO 
VERY MUCH OF THE SIDE CUSHION 
I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN SEE ENOUGH 
OF THE CUSHION TO GO TWICE ACROSS 
AGAIN BOWDITCH IS SO CLOSE TO THE 
GREEN IT IS SO CLOSE TO THE 
GREEN THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO 
HIM 
THAT LITTLE EXPRESSION TELLS YOU I 
DON'T LIKE THIS ONE 
THERE IS DIFFICULT HE IS GOING TO 
WOBBLE IN THE JAWS OF THE POCKET 
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST HE WAS 
SOMETHING THERE GOING INTO THE 
HAVE A 
HAVE A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
THIS CHANCE HE HAS 
SORTS OF 
TROUBLE CAN HE TAKE 
SORTS OF TROUBLE CAN HE TAKE ADVANTAGE 
HE CERTAINLY NEEDS TO ADVANTAGE NOT THE BEST START REALLY HE 
WANTED TO BE STRAIGHTER ON THIS 
BLACK HOW HE DID WELL TO HOLD FOR IT 
HE HAS OVER SCREWED IT WILL STOP 
NOW 
THAT IS 
A BIT CARELESS HE 
HAS OVER SCREWED IT 
BELIEVE WHAT 
HE HAS JUST 
WELL THIS CLOTH IS ULTRA 
RESPONSIVE ASSISTED BY THE UNDER 
TABLE HEATING BUT 
CARTER HAS 
PLAYING ON IN OR CLOTH IDENTICAL TO 
IT FOR 
ALMOST TWO WEEKS 
SO 
TO IT FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS SO THAT WAS PRETTY DISAPPOINTING ONCE AGAIN 
TO HAVE 
CHANGE THE RUN OF THINGS 
AS IT SO OFTEN DOES CHANGED A 
I SAID BEFORE 
THE MATCH 
NOT SEE EITHER PLAYER WAS WINNING 
EASILY I SAID 
IT IS CLOSE THIS EVENING IF IT IS 
THERE MIGHT BE SOME FUN FOR US ONE 
PLAYER OR THE OTHER OR PERHAPS BOTH 
WILL TRY TO NAIL DOWN A MATCH 
WINNING CHANCE IN THE MOST 
IMPORTANT MATCH OF HIS LIFE 
YES I 
THINK WE ARE IN FOR A BIT OF DRAMA 
AT THE CRUCIBLE THIS EVENING YOU 
CANNOT PICK BETWEEN THESE TWO 
PLAYERS 
NOTHING AS EXCITING AS SEEN TWO 
PLAYERS OUT THERE TRYING TO COPE 
UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE SEEING THAT BLACK STOPS THE MINI ROT 
EIGHT REDS THREE PAINS FIVE BLACKS 
AND AT VERY IMPORTANT JUNCTURE 
HAVING LOST THE LAST FOUR FRAMES 
AND SIX OF THE LAST SEVEN THREE PINKS 
HOW THE BREAK ENDS ON SIXTY EIGHT BUT 
CARTER IS HAPPY WITH THAT THE 
BREAK HE REDUCES THE DEFICIT FOR A 
STOCK ALI CARTER IS IN TRAINING TO 
BECOME A COMMERCIAL PILOT FOR WHEN 
HE STOPS HIS SNOOKER CAREER 
INTO THE NEXT FRAME NOW 
A THAT IS WHAT HE IS PLAYING FOR 
THEIR THAT IS WHAT HE IS PLAYING 
FOR HE HAS HIT THE WRONG BALL 
WHAT A MISTAKE THAT IS WHAT A 
MISJUDGMENT THAT IS O. K. THE BLACK 
IS OUT OF COMMISSION THE PINK IS 
NOT PERFECTLY PLACED BUT HE DIDN'T 
PLAY TO CATCH THAT RED 
HE HAS GOT A GREAT CHANCE NOW OF 
DEVELOPING THE BLACK IF HE CAN GET 
ON THE RED THAT IS JUST TO THE LEFT 
IN SUCH 
A WAY 
THAT HE CAN POT THAT 
HE CAN BRING THE BACK BLACK INTO 
PLAY HE DID NOT HAVE THE ANGLE TO 
DO IT THIS TIME BUT HE WILL HAVE 
IN A COUPLE OF SHOTS TIME 
SHOTS'S HE HAS FINISHED A BIT 
STRAIGHT L. DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN POWER THIS IN AND MAKE THE ANGLE 
HE NEEDS TO FORCE IT IN TO GET OVER 
THERE THAT HAS GONE WRONG END OF 
BREAK 
HE GOT THE NECESSARY STUN BUT 
NEEDED PERHAPS A SHADE MORE OF 
RIGHT OF CENTRE STRIKING 
YES HE WAS JUST A FRACTION OUT 
HERE THAT IS WHERE HE WAS TRYING 
TO GET TO HE DID NOT QUITE GET THE 
SIDE ON IT 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE A GO AT THIS 
ONE IF HE CAN GET AROUND THE BACK 
OF THE BLACK AND RED SO IF IN ONE 
RED LOOKING AT THE POTTING ANGLE 
HE WOULD NEED TO GET A TERRIFIC 
AMOUNT OF LEFT HAND SIDE ON THAT 
LET'S SEE IF ALI CARTER HAS A LOOK 
AT IT WHETHER HE WILL FANCY IT 
HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO SWING IT 
AROUND A BIT 
TO GO INTO IT AND 
FINISHED LIKE THIS FINISH GOTTA 
BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE THAT HE 
DOESN'T CATCH THE LOOSE RED ON THE 
RIGHT SIDE 
THE REST AND THE SPIDER ON TOP OF 
THE SPIDER TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE 
HEIGHT PLAYED IT WELL 
A PLENTY OF ROOM TO MANOEUVRE THE 
CUE BALL 
A LITTLE BIT CLOSE TO THE 
SIDE CUSHION 
AS IT HAPPENS IT WAS A FRIENDLY 
AS LONG AS HE PLOTS THE BLUE 
AND HAS THE RIGHT STRENGTH ON THE 
CUE BALL HE WAS BOUND TO BE ON 
THIS RED 
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO CONCENTRATE 
ON THE BLUE THE PINK IS AVAILABLE 
BUT I THINK WE MIGHT SEE HIM TRYING 
TO POT REDS AND BLUES HERE 
AS LONG AS HE KEEPS GETTING ON THE 
CORRECT SIDE OF THE BLUE 
DIDN'T QUITE GET THE RED THAT HE 
WANTED HE STILL GOT THE RED BUT HE 
IS CLOSE TO IT AND HE MAY HAVE TO 
PLAY FOR THE PINK THIS TIME 
HE HAD THE IDEAL ANGLE TO DO SO IF 
PERRY WINS THIS FRAME THAT WILL 
TAKE HIM TO TWELVE HE COULD BE BEHIND 
GOING INTO THIS EVENING'S FINAL 
SESSION 
HE HAS THE PINK AVAILABLE WELL 
PLAYED AT THE MOMENT HE WILL GO 
TO THE LEFT MIDDLE POCKET BUT WHEN 
HE REMOVES THE THREAT IT WILL BE 
AVAILABLE TO THE RIGHT CORNER TO 
THE RIGHT OF PERRY HE HAS CHANGED HIS MIND THIS IS THE CRACK SHOT CORRECT 
THAT IS THINKING THREE SHOTS AHEAD 
BOUGHT THE BLUE POT THE RED AND 
THE PINK IS CLEAR FOR THE RIGHT 
CORNER POT 
THE STANDARD THE PLAYERS ARE 
PRODUCING THEIR OLD AND NINETY PER CENT THAT 
IS VERY GOOD THEY ARE BOTH AT 
A LOT OF THE FRAMES HAVE BEEN WON 
WITH ONE VISIT 
PERRY IS ASSURED OF 
A TWELVE TO TEN LEAD 
THIS WILL BE THE SEVENTH FRAME OF THE 
LAST NINE THAT PERRY HAS ONE 
IF JOE PERRY COULD OPEN UP A THREE 
FRAME ADVANTAGE IT WOULD TAKE 
BIT OF PEGGING BACK THE WAY HE IS 
CUEING 
A WORSE POSITION HE COULD BE IN AT 
THE END OF THIS SESSION IS TWELVE TO TWELVE 
BUT IT COULD BE THIRTEEN TO ELEVEN FOURTEEN TO TEN WOULD TAKE SOME GETTING BACK HE HAS AN ANGLE ON THE YELLOW 
EIGHTY TWO WAS ENOUGH FOR A TWELVE TO TEN LEAD 
BACK TO THAT IN A MOMENT A QUICK 
BREAK FROM THE ACTION IN THE 
CRUCIBLE IT IS OUR LAST VISIT TO 
SHEFFIELD STRAIN STATION WHERE JOHN 
PARROTT AND MARK SELBY HAD BEEN 
CRUSTING THRUSTING A CUE INTO 
UNSUSPECTING COMMUTERS' HANDS 
ICON AWARD TO NAME CHRISTIAN THIS CHRISTIAN THIS IS MARK 
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO 
KNOW WHERE TO PLACE A TRICK SHOT 
TO IMPRESS MY FRIENDS 
LEAD SET ONE 
UP LET US SET ONE 
QUITE A SIMPLE ONE 
BELIEVE IT OR 
NOT HE WILL POT THE PINK IN THE 
MIDDLE HOLE CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT 
PINK IN THE MIDDLE DO YOU THINK HE 
CAN DO IT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT 
DOES IT THEIR 
EGO THAT'S PRETTY 
DOES IT THEIR EGO THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE YOU'RE GOING TO DO 
IT NOW LET SET IT UP AGAIN HOW IS THAT LOOKING 
OFF YOU GO HERE IS THE CUE JUST 
AT THE BACK OF THE CUE BALL THERE 
NICE AND FIRM AND HOPEFULLY THE 
PINK SHOULD GO INTO THE CENTRE 
POCKET 
I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE POCKET BEEN ME 
WE'LL START AGAIN CAN YOU 
BELIEVE THAT 
ANY IT MAKES ME 
LOOK BETTER GETTING IT FIRST TIME 
TYPICAL MARK I THINK HE SET THAT 
UP WRONG YOU CAN DO IT THIS TIME 
COME ON THEY UGO IT WAS MARK 
SELBY HE SET THEM UP WRONG IN THE 
FIRST PLACE THERE YOU GO IT IT MAKES ME LOOK BETTER 
THAT IS THE LAST PIECE OF ADVICE 
DISPENSED BY OUR COACHES IT LOOKS 
LIKE YOU LOT OF FUN DOWN THERE 
FOR ALL STOP IT WAS REALLY GOOD FUN 
WE HAD TO ACCOST A FEW PEOPLE TO 
COME ON BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE WERE 
SHY JOHN WAS GREAT AND MARK IN THE 
AFTERNOON ALSO GRADE 
IT WILL BE 
YOUR NEXT YEAR 
YES I CAN WAIT 
CAN 
WHERE STRAIGHT BACK INTO THE CAN SEMI FINAL FRAME TWENTY THREE WE ARE 
HE HAS THE BLUE BUT IT LOOKS AS 
IF HE POTTED IT INTO THE RIGHT 
SIDE OF THE POCKET 
THAT IS WHY 
THAT WHITE HAS FINISHED COAST 
CLOSE TO THE CUSHION THIS BLUE I 
AM NOT SURE IF HE CAN AVOID THE 
CANNON ONTO THE GREEN IF YOU'RE 
ALL SET THE WHITE WOULD CAN IN THE 
GREEN IF HE ROLLS IT CANNON 
TRIED TO SCREW IN BEHIND THE PINK 
OF COURSE IT IS GLORY THAT THESE 
PLAYERS ARE AFTER AN APPEARANCE IN 
THE FINAL IN ALL PROBABILITY THE 
BEST CHANCE EITHER OF THEM WILL 
EVER HAVE THE MONEY IS SECONDARY 
BUT FOR THE RECORD IT IS FIFTY TWO THOUSAND 
FOR LOSING A SEMI FINAL ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
FOR THE RUNNER UP AND TO WONDER 
AND FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THE CHAMPION 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
LOOK WHERE IT IS GOING TO FINISH 
DEPENDING ON HOW STRAIGHT HE IS 
HERE HE MAY BE ABLE TO SCREW BACK 
AND LEAVE THE BLACK ON 
THAT IS WHERE HE WANTED IT THERE 
AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE HAD AN EASY 
BLACK HE IS JUST LEAVING IT LONGISH 
THESE NEED GOOD CUEING BECAUSE HE 
HAS GOT TO SCREW BACK HERE 
CARTER HAS LOST FIVE FRAMES OUT OF 
SIX TODAY HE KNOWS THAT IF HE CAN 
WIN THIS ONE AND THE REMAINING 
FRAME OF THE SESSION HE WOULD BE 
TWELVE TO TWELVE GOING INTO THIS EVENING'S 
FINAL SESSION TOOK HIS EYE OFF THE POT 
NOT A DIFFICULT BALL ORDINARILY HE HE SEEMS TO HAVE MISSED A FEW WITH THE 
REST HE DOES NOT SEEM THAT 
COMFORTABLE WITH THE REST HE WOULD 
THINK HE WOULD BE PRETTY GOOD 
BECAUSE HE IS NOT THE TALLEST OF 
PLAYERS YOU WOULD 
WHEN I SAY THE DREADED REST ONLY 
FOR SOME PEOPLE I'M GLAD THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE STATISTICS WHEN I WAS 
PLAYING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ZERO OUT 
OF FIFTY 
JIMMY WHITE WAS VERY GOOD 
WITH THE REST IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY 
YESTERDAY 
THE WHIRLWIND IS FORTY SIX AMAZING IF 
YOU'RE WATCHING JIMMY I HOPE YOU 
HAD A GOOD DAY 
HE WAS VERY UNLUCKY NOT TO MAKE IT 
TO THE CRISTOBAL THIS YEAR HE GOT 
TO THE LAST QUALIFYING ROUND 
CRISTOBAL MARK KING BEAT HIM 
THE CRISTOBAL 
HE HAS GOT THE PERFECT ANGLE HERE 
IF THE JUDGES THIS HE 
COULDN'T HAVE PLAYED THAT MUCH 
BETTER 
BUT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO CANNON THE 
BLACK 
HE KNEW HE HAD A GOOD CHANCE TO 
SCORE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE 
VERY CONSISTENT POT SUCCESS RATE 
FOR JOE PERRY THIS NEED PERFECT 
CUE IN 
THIS MEANS PERFECT 
KILLING CUEING 
HE LOOKED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
SAFETY SHOT BUT DECIDED TO TAKE ON 
THE LONG STRAIGHT RED THE CASE ON 
THE YELLOW TURNED OUT VERY NICE FOR 
JOE PERRY KISS 
WHAT SORT OF ANGLE HAS HE GOT ON 
THE SPREAD THIS RED 
HE HAS LOOKED SO RELAXED ABOUT THIS 
YEAR'S EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT COM WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
HE HAS BEEN VERY RELAXED AROUND THE 
VENUE 
A D. CERTAINLY HAS PRODUCED VENUE THE BEST CONSISTENCY THAT HE EVER 
HAS AND HE 
NOT TOO FAR FROM CLINCHING THE 
FRAME AT AND HE LETS HIS 
CONCENTRATION LAPSED MY POINT 
ABOUT TWENTY ONE SECONDS HE HAS BEEN 
FLOWING SO EASILY FROM SHOT TO SHOT 
HE HAS NOT HAD TO SORT OUT A NEW 
SHOT CHOICE BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN 
PUTTING THE CUE BALL EXACTLY WHERE 
HE WANTED THAT WAS A CASE WHERE IS 
HE DID NOT PUT THE OBJECT BALL 
WHERE HE WANTED 
AT LEAST ALI CARTER HAS NOT LEFT AN 
EASY STARTER FOR JOE PERRY 
STRETCHING A LITTLE BIT ON THAT ONE 
NOT EASY WHEN YOU ARE FULLY 
STRETCHED TO DELIVER THE CUE IN A 
STRAIGHT LINE GILL HAS DONE THIS 
FEW TIMES IN THIS MATCH WHERE HE'S 
GOT TO THE STAGE WHERE HE WAS GOING 
TO WIN THE FRAME AND THEN HE BREAKS 
DOWN JOE 
THE THAT HAS MADE SOME AMENDS 
BLACK AND ONE MORE RED SECURES THE 
FRAME 
THAT IS GREAT CUEING NEAR THE 
CUSHION 
THAT WAS FRAME BALL AND BECAUSE OF 
THAT THERE WAS MORE PRESSURE ON IT 
HE COULD HAVE PUT HIMSELF IN 
TROUBLE HERE IF HE GETS OFF THE RED 
A GOOD SAFETY SHOT BUT HE WAS 
TRYING TO GET BEHIND THE PINK 
PERRY DOES NOT WANT TO PLAY THAT 
RENT BUT HE CANNOT HIT THE ONE THAT 
IS OUT FROM THE CUSHION RED 
WHAT A MISTAKE AT LEAST THE OTHER 
RED HAS GONE SAFE ON THE SIDE 
CUSHION BUT HE HIT THAT MUCH TOO 
THIN 
EITHER OF THE FIRST CIRCLES 
CIRCLES AND HE CAN LEAVE THE RED 
FOR THE CORNER AMAZING HE HAS 
GONE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE WHICH 
MEANS THAT THE POT IS AWKWARD INTO 
THE CORNER OR THE MIDDLE THIS IS A BIT TRICKY WELL PLAYED 
NOT ONLY IS HE ON THE PINK HE CAN 
CAN IN THE RED CANNON A BIG 
SHOT THIS NOT QUITE 
THAT WAS A GOOD CHANCE TO DEVELOP 
THAT RED IT IS FUNNY HOW DIFFERENT 
PLAYERS PLAY THIS SHOT 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE THE RED IS 
GOING TO GO WHEN YOU ATTEMPT THAT 
HE HAD GOOD CHANCE TO PUT IT IN 
BEHIND THE BLACK AND SOUND THE RED 
OVER PAST THE BLUE SENT FRAME BALL 
NOT THAT EASY PARTICULARLY AT A 
STAGE LIKE THIS 
PERRY GOT A GOOD LENGTH ON THE CUE 
BALL HE KNEW THAT RED WAS IN OFF 
AND WAS NOT BOTHERED PLAYING FOR 
POSITION IN OFF HE KNEW THAT 
RED WAS ENOUGH 
WHAT A TERRIFIC POT WHAT A PRETTY 
UNKIND RUN OF THE BALL 
TIGHT ON 
THE CUSHION QUITE AMAZING AND HE 
DID NOT GET A FAVOURABLE KISS ON 
THE GREEN THAT 
AND THE FRAME AND THE FRAME 
AND WOULD HAVE DONE IF HE HAD NOT 
CANNONED THE GREEN FULL BALL 
WELL PLAYED 
IF CARTER ADMITS THAT 
HE WAS HANDING A THIRTEEN TO TEN LEAD TO 
PERRY 
JOE PERRY WILL BE KICKING HIMSELF 
AT THE MOMENT 
HE WAS HEADING NICELY FOR THIRTEEN TO TEN HE MISSED A VERY EASY BALL THAT WAS IT 
WHAT A CLEARANCE THIS WOULD BE 
THAT OPENING RED WAS UNBELIEVABLE 
AND GREEN TO FOLLOW WAS PRETTY GOOD 
AS WELL BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH 
RIDING ON IT 
PERRY KNOWS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THIRTEEN 
TEN AHEAD 
HE PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF GREAT 
SHOT WHEN HIS NEED WAS GREATEST HE 
NOW TRAILS TWELVE TO ELEVEN 
CARTER COULD SO EASILY HAVE BEEN 
THIRTEEN TO TEN BEHIND BUT HE SNATCHED 
LAST FRAME THE LAST FRAME MAYBE 
THAT WILL GIVE HIM THE MOMENTUM 
GOING INTO THIS EVENING'S FINAL 
SESSION 
MEANT TO BE A CONTAINING SAFETY IT 
WILL REQUIRE A GOOD SHOT FROM 
CARTER TO GET STARTED DESPITE THE 
PERRY IN OFF 
BUT HE HAS GOT A SHOT ON HERE IF 
HE CAN ROLL THIS RED IN LEAVE 
HIMSELF ON THE BLACK IT WOULD THAT 
LEAVE A GREAT DEAL IT IS A BIT 
AWKWARD TO GET THE CORRECT ANGLE 
THIS IS A TOUGH SHOT IT LOOKS AS 
IF HE IS SCREWING BACK 
THAT WAS ALL OR NOTHING THAT IS 
SIMILAR TO THE GREEN HE JUST 
FORGOT ABOUT LEAVING ANYTHING AND 
UP NOT BIT STRAIGHT IN THE POCKET 
NOT BIT STRAIGHT IN THE POCKET THAT IS NOT THE CASE HE WANTED 
THE CASE HE WANTED THE RED NEEDED 
TO BE POTTED 
ALMOST 
AT ITS LAST ROLL HE 
HIT THE 
TOO HARD 
BLACK 
TOO HARD CLEANED 
THAT TELLS 
ME 
TO HAVE A GO AT CUTTING IT BACK 
INTO THE CORNER IT MEANS THE HIGH 
THE WHITE WILL HEAD UP INTO THE 
BAULK AREA 
A BIT UNLUCKY HE HAS A LONG 
STRAIGHT RED TO GO AT 
DON'T BE SURPRISED THAT HE DOESN'T 
KNOCK THIS LONG ONE IN ALSO 
IT IS HIS TURN TO HAVE A RUN OF THE 
BALL HE IS GOING TO LEAVE THE ONE 
IN THE MIDDLE POCKET BUT NOW THE 
WHITE HAS FINISHED WHERE IT HE'S 
HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT L. SUPPOSE 
EARLIER ON IT WAS JOE PERRY AND HE 
MISSED THE WAS LEAVING THINGS 
WHEN HE MISSED 
THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH AND NATURAL 
CANNON BUT NOT COSTLY 
TO DODGY SAFETY SHOTS IN A ROW FROM 
CARTER TWO DODGY SAFETY SHOT 
SHOPS HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH BOWL 
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE WOULD 
BE A LOT MORE TACTICAL BATTLES BUT 
IT HAS BEEN VERY FLUENT THIS MATCH 
CERTAINLY IN THAT BREAK BUILDING 
DEPARTMENT THERE 
QUITE AS 
THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE 
IS GOOD TO SEE THEY'RE TAKING 
PRESSURE OF THE FIRST 
BOTH PUTTING UP A VERY GOOD SHOW 
POOR SAFETY FROM CARTER ON POUNDS 
WILL ON THE BOUNCE 
I THINK THE INCREASE INTENTION HAD 
A LOT TO DO WITH JOE PERRY MISSING 
THAT LAST SHOT INCREASING 
TENSION THE AVERAGE FRAME TIME IS 
PRETTY BRISK JUST OVER EIGHTEEN MINUTES 
AT FRAME 
HE HAS GOT AWAY AND NO AGAIN HE 
HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT AGAIN THE 
LUCK HAS TURNED EVERY TIME ALI 
MAKES 
A MISTAKE HE 
IS GETTING AWAY 
WITH IT 
ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO 
MISS THAT 
PERRY BE SATISFIED WITH HIS SAFETY 
SHOT IS SATISFIED PERRY NOT 
SATISFIED WITH HIS SAFETY SHOT AS 
WHAT HE MIGHT BE HE WAS SO CLOSE 
TO TAKING A THIRTEEN TO TEN LEAD 
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE CUE 
POWER OF ALI CARTER HAVE A LOOK AT 
THAT ALMOST BEFORE LET'S ALMOST 
THE FULL LENGTH OF THE TABLE AND HE 
CREATE THE BACKSPIN IT IS THE SHOT 
THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO A LOT OF 
THE PROFESSIONALS THAT IS PLAYED PERFECTLY 
HE CAN PLAY AROUND TO LEAVE THOSE 
TWO REDS 
THINK HE IS O. K. HERE HE MAY HAVE TO 
PLAY FOR THE BLUE BUT HE CAN AVOID 
THE REDS 
IT IS GOING TO BE SOME SESSION THIS 
EVENING CLIVE IT IS GOING TO BE 
TENSE IN THE CRUCIBLE 
RED BLACK 
RED NEEDED 
HE WOULD WILL THIS RED TO BE 
AVAILABLE OTHERWISE HE WILL HAVE 
TO PLAY THE CANNON HE WILL NEED 
ONE MORE RED TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY 
SURE THE RED IS AVAILABLE AT THE 
BACK OF THE LITTLE GROUP ALL FOUR 
OF FOUR IT MUST BE QUITE TIGHT SAFELY IN 
PERRY CAN SEAT HE WAS HEADING FOR 
A THIRTEEN TO TEN LEAD MISSED AN EASY BALL 
AND CARTER WON THAT FRAME AND THE 
LAST LEVEL AT TWELVE TO TWELVE GOING INTO 
THIS EVENING'S FINAL 
SESSION WHAT 
A FINAL SESSION THAT PROMISES TO BE 
I WONDER IF WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE 
SOME SIGNS OF TENSION YOU'RE YOU'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO SEE IT THE LAST 
FRAME OF THE SESSION IT IS NOT A 
MATCH YOU CAN PREDICT THIS EVENING 
IS A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME THEY WILL 
COME OUT INTO THE LAST SESSION OF 
THE SEMI FINAL AND THE WINNING POST 
WILL BE LOOMING LARGE 
WHAT ARE THE SPECIAL PRESSURES 
EXERTED UPON IN THIS SITUATION 
POSSIBLY HOW YOU FEEL HOWARD HAS 
GONE UP TO THEN JOE PERRY HAD 
MASSIVE CHANCE THERE TO GO THIRTEEN TO TEN 
AHEAD MISSING THAT RED POSSIBLY TO 
FORGE AHEAD TO FOUGHT IN BUT DOWN 
MARK FOURTEEN TO TEN HE HAS GOT A HORRIBLE 
AFTERNOON THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE 
THIS IN THEY WILL TRY TO GET READY 
FOR THE ONSLAUGHT AHEAD A BIT LONG 
SESSION IT COULD GO ALL THE WAY 
THAT COULD BE A LONG NIGHT AND IT 
COULD BE FASCINATING NIGHT WHO 
IS PREPARED BE DIGGING DEEP BEST 
MEMORIES OF PREVIOUS ENCOUNTERS BE 
THEY MATTER 
IT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING TONIGHT 
IT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THERE 
WILL FIND OUT ABOUT THEMSELVES 
LATER LATER THEY SURE WELL WE WILL BE THERE TO 
SEE IT THAT IS ON B. B. C. TWO 
THIS HAS BEEN ANOTHER GROUND 
BREAKING CHAMPIONSHIP BIG 
BREAKS THAT 
IS ENTIRELY 
FITTING BECAUSE THIS IS THE TWENTY FIFTH 
ANNIVERSARY OF CLIFF THORBURN POT 
MIGHT FIRST EVER MAXIMUM CLIFF 
THORBURN'S FIRST EVER MAXIMUM WE 
WAIT SO LONG AND THEN TWO LONG AT 
THE SAME TIME 
FIRST OF ALL I AM HONOURED TO BE A 
PROFESSIONAL IN HERE THAT I WAS IN 
HONOURED TO PLAY AT THE CRUCIBLE 
AND HONOURED AS SOMEBODY WHO GOES 
DOWN IN HISTORY 
IT WAS FRONT PAGE NEWS 
THERE ARE MOMENTS AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THAT PEOPLE REMEMBER AND THAT IS 
ONE OF THEM 
THE CRUCIBLE L. HAVE 
SO MANY FOND MEMORIES OF THIS 
MAGICAL PLACE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO I 
ACHIEVED SOMETHING NOBODY HAD EVER 
DONE BEFORE AS SPORTING 
ACHIEVEMENT GO IT WAS EQUIPMENT TO 
CLIMBING EVEREST THE THREE MINUTE 
MILE AND NINE DART CHECKOUT THANK 
GOD FOR VIDEO TAPE 
I DO NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT FLUKE IN 
THE FIRST BALL ANYMORE 
NOBODY HAD BEEN THINKING OF A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
AT THE TIME IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE 
BEFORE CLIFF WAS JUST GLAD TO GET 
THE BALL IN AND LET HAVE A GO AT 
THE BLACK 
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING WE WANTED TO 
HAPPEN WE WANTED TO SEE IT JOHN 
SPENCER HAD MADE ONE AT ATONEMENT 
IN SLOUGH UNFORTUNATELY THE CAMERA

AND SLEPT FOR ABOUT THE AN HOUR THE 
NIGHT BEFORE L. WAS IN BAD SHAPE 
HE STOPS BLOWS HIS NOSE AND SAYS 
LET US HAVE A BREAK WHAT AM MOMENT 
THIS IS IT IS TRULY ELECTRIC HERE 
CLIFF THORBURN WAS A GREAT POSITION 
PLAYER HE DID NOT COME GOOD ON THE 
YELLOW 
THE PRESSURE ON CLIFF WAS INTENSE 
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE SHOT THAT 
STICKS OUT THAT WAS WHEN HE POT IT 
BE ALLOWED TO GET ON THE GREEN 
WHEN HE POTTED THE YELLOW TO GET ON 
THE GREEN 
THE WAY HE CLEARED THE CHORUS WAS 
UNBELIEVABLE USE OF THE REACTION 
FROM THE CROWD AND THE OTHER 
PLAYERS IT WAS ONE OF THE MAGIC 
MOMENTS IN THE GAME 
I AM SURE THAT HE IS HOPING AND 
PRAYING THAT CLIFF THORBURN WILL DO 
THIS I WAS SO EXCITED L. THINK 
EVERYBODY WAS 
IT HAD NEVER BEEN 
DONE ONCE HE GOT THAT I KNEW HE 
WOULD GET IT 
PEOPLE ASK IF I WAS NERVOUS I 
STILL KNEW IT WAS A BIG THING L. 
REALLY FELT GOOD PLAYING IT AT THE 
END WHEN I SHUT THE BLACK I JUST 
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE BLACK NEVER 
TOUCHED THE SIDES OF THE POCKET I I WILL NEVER FORGET WHEN HE GOT DOWN 
TO POT THE BLACK THE COMMENTATOR

CRUCIBLE BUT IN THE HISTORY OF 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IS MEMORY THAT WILL STAY WITH ME FOREVER 
A WONDERFUL MEMORIES RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN WATCHING THAT GO 
THROUGH RONNI WAS ONE OF THE TWO 
MEN WHO MADE THE MAXIMUM THIS YEAR 
ASTONISHING ACHIEVEMENTS WE WERE 
ENJOYING THAT FEATURE WHAT WERE 
YOUR MEMORIES OF THAT MOMENT 
I AM 
NOT SURE L. COUNTRY THE REMEMBER 
EXACTLY WHERE WAS L. CERTAINLY 
DIDN'T WATCH IT LIVE CAN TO 
REMEMBER SOME PLAYERS WOULD HAVE 
BEEN BETWEEN MATCHES OR NOT EVEN 
AROUND FOR THE FIRST ROUND L. THINK 
IT WAS A FIRST ROUND MATCH IT 
SEEMS TO BE EARLY ON WHATEVER THE 
SITUATION ALL THE SUDDEN WORD GOT 
OUT AND ALL THE SUDDEN YOU REALISE 
THAT ONE HAS BEEN MADE AMAZING 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT ACHIEVEMENT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS 
IT WAS 
COMPARED TO SNOOKER'S EQUIVALENT OF 
SCALING EVEREST WAS IT AS BIG AS 
THAT 
IT WAS THAT L. HAD NEVER SEEN THAT ONE MADE IN TOURNAMENT PLAY L. WAS 
EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN THEN NOT EVEN 
PROFESSIONAL WHEN THAT WAS MADE L. 
HAD NEVER SEEN ONE TELEVISED THE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD TWO THIS 
SEASON INDEED AT THE CRUCIBLE 
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THE 
STANDARD OF PLAY AMONG MODERN 
PLAYERS 
THE GENERAL STANDARD OF PLAYERS BUILDING HAS KEPT ON GOING WE HAVE 
FED OFF EACH OTHER NOT JUST 
BECAUSE HE IS IN THE RIM BUT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HAS TRACKED POSITIONAL 
PLAY UP TO ANOTHER LEVEL ALONG 
WITH STEPHEN HENDRY WHO STILL HOLDS 
THE MOST ONE HUNDRED BREAKS BETWEEN THOSE 
TWO PLAYERS 
AND THE OVERALL 
STANDARD IS VERY HIGH ADD THAT 
TIME THERE WAS HALF A DOZEN 
PLAYERS WHO COULD WIN A TOURNAMENT 
THERE IS A LOT MORE OR THAN THAT 
NOW CAPABLE 
THE STATS ARE 
FASCINATING RONNIE HAS MADE THREE 
THIS SEASON THERE HAVE BEEN SEVEN 
THIS SEASON IN OVERALL TERMS THEY 
HAVE TIGER WOODS'S PROOF GOLF 
COURSES WILL THEY MAKE BIGGER 
TABLES FOR A SNOOKER DOES A 
DESTROY THE MYSTIQUE IF WE SEE 
MORE 
THE POCKETS ARE HARDER THAN MORE THEY WERE IN THE EIGHTIES THEY DID 
TRY TO TIGHTEN THE POCKETS TO STOP 
THEM IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO TIE 
THEM UP AGAIN BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE 
VERY DIFFERENT TO CLUB TABLES IF IF YOU START PUTTING EXTREMES DOWN 
YOU START GETTING EXTREME RESULTS 
IF YOU MAKE THE POPPET POCKETS SO 
TIGHT THAT NO ONE CAN SCORE YOU'LL 
GET DIFFERENT RESULTS YOU DO NOT 
WANT TO DO THAT THEY HAVE TO BE 
TIGHT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU 
HIT THEM IN THE MIDDLE THEY SHOULD 
GO IN 
IT WAS A MAGIC MOMENT TWO 
TO CELEBRATE HERE AND LOVELY TO 
LOOK 
BACK ON THE GROUND BREAKING 
ACHIEVEMENTS WE HAVE SEEN RONNIE 
IN HERE HE IS PRACTISING IT IS 
HIS DAY OFF BECAUSE HE MANAGED TO 
SECURE A DAY OFF AFTER BEATING 
STEPHEN HENDRY LAST NIGHT WE CAN 
REFLECT A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT WAS A 
SENSATIONAL PERFORMANCE HE WAS AT 
HIS MESMERIC BEST WHEN HE CAME BACK 
FOR THE EVENING SESSION HE WAS 
LEADING BY TWELVE FRAMES TO FOUR BUT 
THE SHOW YOU A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE 
QUALITY OF HIS PLAY LAST NIGHT 
THERE ARE LOOSE THREADS BUT WHAT 
O'SULLIVAN IS A MASTER OF HIS 
OPENING THE BUNCH WITHOUT LOSING 
POSITION RED'S 
IF HE IS STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK IT 
HAS RESTRICTED HIS POSITIONAL 
OPTIONS 
HE CAN'T GET THROUGH TO THE PINK 
THIS IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD IF HE 
PLAYS THE SCREW BACK HE WILL 
COLLIDE WITH THE RED ON THE RIGHT 
HAND CUSHION THAT WILL NOT HELP 
LUCKY TO HAVE THE PINK AS A SECOND 
OPTION 
STILL ONE RED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
CLUSTER THAT HE CAN PLAY FOR 
IN THOSE SITUATIONS RONNIE USUALLY 
LEAVES HIMSELF LITTLE LOW 
HE MADE CERTAIN HE WAS BACK IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE TABLE WITH THAT CUE 
BALL HE ONLY BROUGHT ONE READ INTO 
PLAY 
HENDRY KNOWS THAT HIS FRAME IS OVER 
O'SULLIVAN CAN GET A BUNCH OPEN 
WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT NOTHING LESS 
HE PLAYED THE CANNON HE SPLIT THEM 
OPEN 
ANOTHER FRAME IN THE BACK BACK 
IT 
O'SULLIVAN HAS PICKED UP WHEN HE 
LEFT OFF AT LUNCHTIME 
AN EXHIBITION OF SUPREME SKILL 
CAN HE MAKE HIS TENTH CENTURY OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
HE HAS LET HIMSELF NICELY ON THE 
BLUE KENNY JUST NUDGE THE RED CAN HE UNLUCKY 
IT LOOKS AS IF IT IS AUTOMATIC THE THE IT IS FRIGHTENINGLY GOOD 
O'SULLIVAN DOING HIS BIT TOWARDS 
SETTING A NEW RECORD OF TOTAL 
CENTURIES FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
THIS IS THE FIFTY EIGHTH THE RECORD IS SIXTY EIGHT 
O'SULLIVAN'S THIRD TOTAL CLEARANCE 
OF THE GAME YOU CANNOT ARGUE WITH 
PERFECTION THAT IS TWELVE FRAMES IN A 
ROLE FOR O'SULLIVAN HE LEADS BY THIRTEEN 
FRAMES TO FOUR 
HIS FOURTH CENTURY OF THE MATCH BUT 
HIS RUN OF TWELVE FRIENDS IN A ROW CAME 
TO AN END WHEN STEPHEN CLAIMED THE 
NEXT TWO HOWEVER THERE WAS NO 
STOPPING THE ROCKET IN FROM TWENTY ONE 
FRAME MATCH FRAME 
O'SULLIVAN IS PLAYING SO WELL I AM 
ASSUMING HE IS GOING TO POT THE 
LOOSE RENTS AND SO THE POINT OF 
INTEREST WILL BE HOW HE DEVELOPS 
THE BUNCH 
O'SULLIVAN LOVES THE BIG STAGE AND 
LOVES TO PUT ON A SHOW AND THE 
FURTHER HE IS IN FRONT THE MORE HE 
CAN FORGET ABOUT THE RESULT AND 
JUST CONCENTRATE ON PERFORMING 
ALL GREAT CHAMPIONS WHEN THEY GET 
IN FRONT THEY ARE NOT LOOKING OVER 
THEIR SHOULDER THEY'RE JUST 
LOOKING AHEAD HE HAS PLAYED SOME 
SUPERB STRIKER TODAY HE HAS ON THE 
HIT THAT SLIGHTLY IT HAS TO BE 
SAID HE WANTED TO BE A LITTLE LOW 
ON HIS RED BUT MAYBE NOT AS LOW AS 
THIS POTTING IT WILL BRING OTHER 
REDS INTO PLAY 
COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED THAT ANY 
BETTER 
WHEN WE GET TO THIS SITUATION IT 
IS LIKE A DIFFERENT VENUE 
COMPLETELY BY IT IS CATHEDRAL LIKE 
AT THE MOMENT THE EXPECTATION WHEN 
THIS YOUNG MAN COMES TO THE TABLE HE HAS RUN PAST THE PINK AS USUAL INCH PERFECT 
O'SULLIVAN HAS GOT HIS GAME MORE 
IMPORTANTLY HIS MIND IS INTO 
OPTIMUM SHAPE HE HAS HAD A FEW 
IMPORTANT HERE IN PORTIONS THIS 
IS A REMARKABLE EXHIBITION OF 
SUSTAINED EXCELLENCE IN 
O'SULLIVAN IN PURSUITS OF HIS ELEVENTH 
CENTURY OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP THE 
SIXTIETH OF THE TOURNAMENT 
IT IS HIS OWN FOURTH CENTURY OF THE 
DAY 
THE RECORD FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP DURING THE 
TOURNAMENT THE RECORD IS HELD BY 
STEPHEN HENDRY WITH SIXTEEN CENTURY 
BREAKS THAT WILL BE ANOTHER TARGET 
FOR RUNNY STEPHEN HENDRY HAD THE 
MOST MAXIMUMS WITH EIGHT BUT RONNIE 
BETTERED THAT EARLIER ON WITH HIS 
NINTH IN TOURNAMENT PLAY AND NOW 
CLOSING IN ON THAT RECORD SIXTEENTH 
CENTURIES IN THE TOURNAMENT 
EXCELLENCE ON A SCALE OF TIGER 
WOODS ROGER FEDERER OR ANY OTHER 
SUPREME ALL TIME GREATS YOU CARE TO 
MENTION 
EVEN FROM A STRAIGHT ANGLE ON THE 
BLUE HE OVERRAN IT 
ON THE SEVENTEENTH FRAME WINNING POST AND 
HE TOOK THE NEXT HERE HE IS IN 
FRAME TWENTY THREE WITH THE CHANCE TO CLOSE 
THE MATCH WITH A DARE TO A DAY AT 
A DAY TO SPARE 
THERE IS THE HENRY FAMILY GORDON 
ON THE RIGHT NOT MUCH OF A PLAYER 
BUT HE TOLD ME AT BREAKFAST THAT 
HIS FATHER CERTAINLY WAS HE WAS OF 
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS BUT WHEN 
THERE WAS NO PROFESSIONAL GAME HE 
DIED AT THE AGE OF FORTY FOUR AND NEVER SAW 
HIS GRANDSON PLAY HOW HE WOULD 
HAVE LOVED IT 
TEN POINT BEHIND POINTS IF YOU 
DELICATE POSITIONAL SHOTS TO BE 
PLAYED A FEW JUST WATCH THE WAY 
HE MANOEUVRES THE CUE BALL 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS BEEN A CREDIT TO 
HIMSELF AND THE GAME THIS EVENING 
MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE COME OUT AND 
THROWN CAUTION TO THE WIND FROM 
FRAME ONE BUT HE NEVER REALLY 
PLAYED ANY WRONG SHOTS HE TRIED 
HIS BEST IN EVERY FRAME 
HE NEVER 
LET HIS HEAD GO DOWN AND HE HAS 
PROVED THIS YEAR THAT HE IS STILL A 
FORCE IN THE GAME 
I THINK THAT IS THE MAJOR THING 
THAT HENDRY WILL TAKE AWAY FROM 
THIS TOURNAMENT HE WANTED TO 
REEXPERIENCED THE FEELING OF BEING 
GENUINELY IN CONTENTION AND HE WAS 
UNTIL HE RAN INTO THIS GENIUS AT 
THE PEAK OF HIS FORM TWENTY TWO AHEAD THIRTY FIVE 
REMAINING 
THIS HAS BEEN AN REMAINING OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE FROM RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN JUST THINK IT WAS A 
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS 
PLAYING STEPHEN HENDRY IN THE U. K. 
AND EVERYBODY QUESTIONS IF HE HAD 
THE RIGHT ATTITUDE 
SO CARELESS HE CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
SINCE THEN HE HAS COME BACK AND I 
WAS GOING TO SAY HE HAS PLAYED 
CONSISTENTLY FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF 
SEASONS THAT WAS JUST SHEER 
CARELESSNESS 
IF HENDRY IS GOING TO LOSE HE 
WOULD SOONER LOSE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN THAN SEVENTEEN SEX 
SEVENTEEN TO SEVEN SEVENTEEN TO SIX PINK AND BLACK STILL NEEDED THE BLACK TO KEEP THE MATCH ALIVE 
WHAT A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE FROM 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN FULLY JUSTIFIED 
HERE AN AUTHENTIC GENIUS THAT GAVE 
A MASTERCLASS STEPHEN HENDRY DID 
QUITE WELL WITH THE FEW CHANCES HE 
HAD O'SULLIVAN WINS BY A SEVENTEEN FRAMES 
TO SEX TO GO THROUGH TO THE FINAL 
SEVENTEEN TO SIX 
I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR 
STEPHEN'S GAME AND HIS ABILITY TO 
PRODUCE IT AND IT WAS SIMILAR WITH 
MARK WILLIAMS THERE IS AN 
ANTICIPATION IF YOU LIKE YOU 
EXPECT WHEN SOMEONE LIKE STEPHEN 
GET TO THE TABLE THAT HE COULD JUST 
CLEAR UP AND KEEP YOU SITTING IN 
THE CHAIR FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME 
I KIND OF GOT A FRAME ON THE BOARD 
AND I JUST SAID RELAX STAY 
RELAXED THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO 
I HAVE HAD ONE BAD SESSION AND I 
KEPT SAYING TO MYSELF YOU HAVE 
THREE TO CALL IT BACK AND TODAY 
COULD NOT HAVE GONE ANY BETTER 
THAT IS AS COMPREHENSIVELY 
OUTPLAYED AS I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY 
CAREER L. CANNOT REMEMBER RUNNING 
MISSING A BALL THIS AFTERNOON OR 
GETTING OUT OF POSITION IT WAS 
ALMOST FAULTLESS SNOOKER 
OUTSTANDING L. SAID TO HIM 
AFTERWARDS HIS SAFETY PLAY WAS 
UNBELIEVABLE THE ONLY TIME I WAS 
COMING TO THE TABLE WAS EITHER TO 
BREAK OFF OR A PLAY FROM AN 
IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION YOU HAVE TO 
ADMIRE IT BECAUSE IT WAS PERFECT 
SNOOKER 
I JUST WANT TO COMPETE SNOOKER ALL SEASON I HAD BEEN ENJOYING 
PRACTICE AND BY FORM HAS BEEN 
FANTASTIC DURING THIS CHAMPIONSHIP 
IT HAS COME IN SPELLS WHEN I GET A 
BIT OF FORM I NEED TO MAKE THE 
MOST OF IT THAT IS WHAT I HAVE 
DONE THIS IS NOT MY A GAME THERE 
ARE AREAS I NEED TO IMPROVE ON A 
SESSION LIKE THIS MORNING AND 
TONIGHT BILLS CONFIDENCE YOU START 
TO GET COMFORTABLE AMONG THE BALLS 
I CAN'T BE TOO HARD ON MYSELF L. AM 
ALWAYS STRIVING TO HIT THE HEIGHTS 
THAT I AM CAPABLE OF L. DON'T THINK 
THAT'S A BAD THING L. ENJOY PLAYING 
WELL AND I 
WANT TO PLAY WELL L. WANT TO SCORE OR AND GET AMONG THE 
BALLS STEPHEN IS NO DIFFERENT A 
FANCIED MY CHANCES 
YOU HAVE TO 
STAY WITH RONNIE AS SOON AS YOU 
LET HIM GET TWO OR THREE FRAMES A 
FRONT IN FRONT HE IS UNSTOPPABLE 
BECAUSE WHEN HE PLAYS WITH SUCH 
CONFIDENCE IF YOU PUT HIM UNDER 
PRESSURE HE CAN CRACK L. COULD PUT 
HIM UNDER PRESSURE TODAY WHEN THE 
GATES IN FRONT OF YOU IT IS ALMOST 
ALL OVER 
I WOULD GET CARRIED AWAY 
I'M GOING TO ENJOY THE PROSPECT OF 
TWO DAYS OF THE FINAL OF THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IT IS GREAT TO BE 
HERE 
IF HE PLAYS LIKE THAT HE HERE WINS IT SIMPLE AS THAT PERFECT PERFECT SNOOKER THAT IS WHAT STEPHEN 
HENDRY SAID HOW GENUINELY 
ADVANTAGEOUS IS IT TO RUN THAT HE 
HAS A DAY OFF TODAY IS HIS FEET UP 
FOR HIM TODAY 
IN ANOTHER RANKING 
TOURNAMENT WITH LESS FRIENDS YOU 
WOULD WANT TO CARRY ON BUT THE 
FINAL IS A MONTH ON ITSELF 
FRAMES A DAY OF PREPARATION IS 
USEFUL THE OTHER TWO PLAYERS ARE 
GOING TO BE HARD PUSHED TOMORROW 
THEY MAY HAVE A LONG NIGHT AHEAD OF 
THEM 
STEPHEN HENDRY HAS BEEN IN A THEM SEMI FINAL HERE HE HAS NOT WON A 
TOURNAMENT OF ANY DESCRIPTION FOR 
THIRTY EIGHT MONTHS WHAT POSITIVES WILL HE 
TAKE FROM THIS 
HE WILL TAKE 
ENCOURAGEMENT BY THE RESULTS HE HAS 
HAD BEATING GOOD YOUNG PLAYERS 
HE HAS BEEN HITTING THE BALL BETTER 
THE THINGS HE HAS BEEN DOING 
PRACTISING ARE NOW COMING ON THE 
TABLE BUT THE BAD THING IS THAT IS 
AT THE END OF THE SEASON L. THINK 
HE WOULD LIKE ANOTHER TOURNAMENT 
FAIRLY QUICKLY FRUSTRATING THE FRUSTRATING THE POSSIBILITIES ARE THAT HE WILL ON 
RANKING TOURNAMENT AGAIN THAT 
STANDARD IS GOOD ENOUGH WIN 
RANKING TOURNAMENT WHETHER HE WINS 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP IS A TOUGH ONE 
YOU HAVE TO WAIT EVERY YEAR BECAUSE 
THERE IS ONLY ONE TOURNAMENT AND A 
LOT OF GOOD PLAYERS LOOKING TO WIN 
IT 
GOOD TO SEE HIM BACK LET ME IT REMIND YOU THAT TOMORROW YOU CAN 
SEE THE FINAL STAGES OF THE 
BADMINTON HORSE TRIALS ON B. B. C. TWO 
FROM ONE O'CLOCK P. M. WE WILL BE BACK AT SEVEN P. M. 
FOR THE CLIMAX OF WHAT IS 
DEVELOPING TO BE A INTRIGUING SEMI 
FINAL IN THE MEANTIME PLENTY OF 
NAILS BEING NOT AROUND THE COUNTRY 
WITH THE PERIODS VARIOUS FOOTBALL 
MATCHES IN THE AIR WE WILL SEE YOU LATER
