MARGARET HODGE 
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH 
NOW AS YOU KNOW YESTERDAY A 
SURPRISE BUDGET WAS PLACED ON THE 
BRITISH PEOPLE IT CAME IN THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS WE SHOULD OF BEEN 
DOING IT LIVE JENNY 
BUT TODAY WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS 
COMING IT WAS ALL TO GET THE 
CHANCELLOR AND THE PRIME MINISTER 
OUT OF THE PROBLEM OF THE ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN PENCE TAX BAND NOT ONLY 
DID HE DO THAT HE CAME OUT WITH 
RAISING THE THRESHOLDS WHICH MEANS 
SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE 
UNAFFECTED BY THE TEN PENCE TAX 
BAND ARE GOING TO GET ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
OF TAX FREE MONEY AS A RESULT OF 
THE CHANGES NICE WORK IF YOU CAN 
GET IT 
MARGARET HODGE CAN WE GET IT 
CLEAR NONE OF THE SEVENTEEN MILLION 
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GOT THIS MONEY IF 
IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE NEED TO 
CLEAR UP THE TEN PENCE MESS 
CLEARLY WHAT ALISTAIR WAS DOING 
YESTERDAY WAS DEALING WITH THE 
MISTAKE WE RECOGNISED HAD OCCURRED 
IN WHAT WAS A GOOD MOVE OF TRYING 
TO SIMPLIFY THE TAX REGIME AND 
LOWER THE BASIC RATE OF TAX FROM TWENTY TWO 
TO TWENTY PENCE BUT THERE WERE A A 
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAD WERE WORSE 
OFF 
I PROMISE YOU OUR VIEWERS OFF HAVE SEEN THIS ENDLESSLY THIS 
MORNING A LOT OF PEOPLE LET'S CALL 
THEM MIDDLE BRITAIN ARE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
BETTER OFF THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO 
WITH THE TEN PENCE TAX BAND AND 
THEY WOULDN'T OF GOT THIS MONEY IF 
IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE NEED TO 
CLEAR UP THE MESS 
HE NEEDED TO 
CLEAR UP THE MESS MESS QUICKLY AND 
HE DID THAT BUT HE WAS ABLE IN 
DOING THAT IN THE SIMPLEST WAY 
POSSIBLE BY RAISING PERSONAL 
ALLOWANCES HE WAS ABLE TO RESPOND 
REALLY TO THE SOME OF THE IMPACT 
WE'RE FEELING FROM THE GLOBAL 
PRESSURES OF RISING FUEL PRICES AND 
RISING INFLATION AND PUT BACK INTO 
THE ECONOMY 
ALMOST THREE BILLION 
TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION WHICH IS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY A YEAR 
TO THE LESS WELL OFF IT IS THE 
LOWER 
IT IS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND LOWER THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
MENTS IT IS MORE THAN THAT ACTUALLY 
WHAT WAS IT IT ABOUT THE GLOBAL 
ECONOMY THE CHANCELLOR HAD 
DISCOVERED YESTERDAY THAT HE 
DIDN'T KNOW EIGHT WEEKS AGO GIVE 
ME ONE THING WE DIDN'T KNOW EIGHT 
WEEKS AGO ABOUT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
THAT WE KNOW TODAY JUST ONE THING 
HE TOOK HIS APPROACH BECAUSE OF THE 
MISTAKE I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY 
DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
BUT HE TOOK ADVANTAGE WELL IT COST 
US THREE BILLION IT PUT MONEY INTO 
THE ECONOMY AT GOOD TIME WHEN 
THERE ARE DEFLATIONARY PRESSURES 
NO NO THERE ARE INFLATIONARY 
PRESSURES NOT DEFLATIONARY 
PRESSURES PRESSURES WHEN PEOPLE ARE BUYING LESS HE PUT 
MORE MONEY INTO THEIR POCKETS WHICH 
WILL HELP KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING 
AND THAT'S PART OF THE STABILITY WE 
WANT 
I WATCH THE CHANCELLOR ON WANT NEWSNIGHT LAST NIGHT AND IT IS 
INCREDIT ULUS INCREDIT ULUS FOR 
HIM TO SAY WE ARE WE ARE DOING THIS 
NOW BECAUSE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
DURING THE BUDGET WE KNEW FOOD 
PRICES WERE RISING AND WE KNEW 
UTILLY BILLS WERE RISING AND THE 
ECONOMY WAS SLOWING DOWN SO IF IT 
WAS NECESSARY TO PUMP PRIME TO 
BOOST PEOPLE'S INCOMES BY CUTTING 
TAX WHY DIDN'T HE DO IT IN THE 
BUDGET 
ANDREW I WILL I WILL BUDGET REPEAT WHAT I SAID EARLIER HE TOOK 
ACTION BECAUSE OF THE MISTAKE THAT 
OCCURRED FOR THE OVER FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOSE IN THE BASIC 
RATE HE TOOK ACTION ON THAT BUT 
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF TAKING THAT 
ACTION IN TWO WAYS ONE HE WANTED A 
SIMPLE WAY OF TRYING TO REPAIR WHAT 
HAD GONE WRONG AND THAT WAS BY 
RAISING PERSONAL ALLOWANCES TWO 
HE DID WANT TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO 
ITS ECONOMY 
WHY DIDN'T HE DO THAT IN THE 
BUDGET IF IT WAS UTILITY UTILITY 
UTILITY PRICES THAT ARE RISING AND 
THE ECONOMY IS SLOWING DOWN WHY 
DIDN'T HE DO THAT SIX OR SEVEN 
WEEKS AGO 
AT THAT TIME HE THOUGHT 
THAT THE MONEY YOU KNOW HE ACTED 
I'VE GOT TO SAY AGAIN HE DIDN'T 
ACT BECAUSE HE WANTED SPECIFICALLY 
TO PUT MORE ACTION INTO THE ECONOMY 
HE ACTED BECAUSE OF THE MISTAKE 
AROUND THE FIVE MILLION BUT HE 
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY 
THAT GAVE HIM TO PUMP MORE MONEY 
INTO THE ECONOMY BY GIVING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
IS AN UNFUNDED TAX CUT 
NO IT IS 
NOT NOT HOW IS IT BEING FUND SND 
IT IS 
BEING FUNDED BY BORROWING 
SO UNFUNDED 
WHEN KEN WAS CHANCELLOR OUR DEBT 
WAS WAS FORTY THREE PER CENT OF G. D. P. WE ARE DOWN AT 
THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT AND THE ASSURANCES THAT 
ALISTAIR HAS GIVEN WE ARE AT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT 
AND THE ASSURANCES THAT ALISTAIR 
HAS HAS GIVEN WE ARE MEETING THE 
FISCAL RULES WHEN HE COMES TO THE 
PRE BUDGET REPORT HE WILL MAINTAIN 
THEM BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF OUR 
ECONOMY ECONOMY WE DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THAT 
ANYMORE YOU WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH 
JENNY ON THAT IN MINUTE 
IT MIGHT BE TRUE ANDREW 
WE ARE GOING TO HEAR WHAT KEN 
CLARKE HAS TO SAY LET'S HEAR WHAT 
YOU HAD TO STAY GILES WAS OUT AND 
ABOUT TO FIND OUT HOW THIS IS GOING 
DOWN WITH THE PUBLIC 
IS THIS ADDRESSING 
PEOPLE'S CONCERNS IN A SENSIBLE WAY 
OR BRIBING 
THE ELECTORATE BRIBING BRIBING THE ELECTORATE BECAUSE HE WANTS TO 
WIN CREWE VERY MUCH SO AND NOT 
ONLY THAT HE WANTS TO WIN A 
GENERAL ELECTION BUT HE WILL NOT 
DO IT LIKE THAT HE HAS GOT TO 
PERFORM MUCH BETTER 
HE IS PROBABLY DOING IT BECAUSE THE 
ELECTION IS COMING UP 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOR WHAT FOR THE YEAR THAT'S 
NOT ENOUGH MATE 
I WOULDN'T SAY IT IS A BRIBE BUT I 
WOULD SAY IT'S A TACTIC TO TRY AND 
GET THE VOTERS BACK BUT IT 
MIGHT NOT WORK THIS TIME 
THAT IS WHAT SOME PEOPLE HAD TO SAY 
ON THE STREETS OF LONDON 
KEN CLARKE HAVE YOU KNOWN I'VE 
COVERED BUDGETS ALMOST AS LONG AS 
YOU HAVE YOU KNOWN TIME WHEN 
CHANCELLOR HAD TO COME BACK SIX OR 
SEVEN WEEKS AFTER BUG AND REWRITE 
THE BUDGET 
NOT LIKE THIS NO L. 
LOST A BUDGET REVOLUTION AND I HAD 
TO INTRODUCE A NEW TAX TO REPLACE 
THE REVENUE L. HAVE NEVER KNOWN A 
SHAMEFUL RESPONSE TO OPINION POLLS 
AND A BY ELECTION AND SO SIX WEEKS 
LATER YOU COME BACK WITH 
IRRESPONSIBLE POLICIES L. FEEL 
SORRY FOR THE CHANCELLOR I LIKE 
LIKE ALISTAIR DARLING BUT IT IS 
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE HIM 
SERIOUSLY AS CHANCELLOR THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS OBLIGED HIM TO BEHAVE 
IN A WAY WHICH PAYS NO REGARD TO 
THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST AT 
ALL HE IS TAKING TERRIBLE 
TERRIBLE RISKS ABOUT WHERE WE WILL 
BE BE MIDDLE ENGLAND IS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY BETTER OFF 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE AN IDIOT AND THE 
PUBLIC ARE NOT IDIOTS TO THINK THIS 
IS A BRIBE FOR THE CREWE AND 
NANTWICH BY ELECTION 
JENNY HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE 
FIGURES ON THE BORROW BORROWING 
THAT MARGARET HODGE MENTIONED 
I WANT TO SHOW YOU A GRAPH THAT WAS 
PUBLISHED IN THAT BUDGET JUST ABOUT 
SIX WEEKS AGO 
SIX WEEKS AGO IT SHOWS THAT BORROWING AS A 
PERCENTAGE OF NATIONAL INCOME IS 
BUMPING UP UP INTO TWO THOUSAND NINE TWO THOUSAND TENTHS 
AGAINST THAT FORTY PER CENT CEILING THAT WAS 
THE CEILING THAT GORDON BROWN 
IMPOSED ON DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF 
NATIONAL INCOME 
THAT WAS BEFORE THE THREE BILLION THAT 
HE JUST HAD TO BORROW TO FINANCE 
THIS LOWERING OF THE INCOME TAX 
THRESHOLD SO ALREADY BUMPING UP 
AGAINST THE SELF IMPOSED FORTY PER CENT 
CEILING MARGARET HODGE THIS IS 
GOING TO PUT HIM OVER IT ISN'T IT 
THIS IS TROUBLE FOR HIM 
I CAN'T SEE THE END OF THE SLIDE 
BUT THE DEBT WHICH IS THE IMPORTANT 
THING THE DEBT IS AT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT 
AT THE MOMENT BUT IT IS PROJECTED 
TO GO UP TO THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT PER CENT BEFORE THE THREE 
BILLION THAT HE HAD TO BORROW 
LET'S WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
WHEN KEN CLARKE HAD THE STEWARDSHIP 
OF THE ECONOMY THE DEBT WE 
INHERITED WAS FORTY THREE PER CENT 
MARGARET THAT'S NONSENSE 
INHERITED WAS FORTY THREE PER CENT MARGARET THAT'S NONSENSE 
MARGARET THAT'S NONSENSE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE CAN TAKE 
ACTION THAT WE DID THAT WE TOOK 
YESTERDAY IS BECAUSE OF THE 
STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY 
AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE GOT DEBT 
WELL UNDER CONTROL 
LOOK AT THE FIGURE THERE THE LNDZ 
LEFT HAND SIDE IS ACTING ON MY 
FIGURES FIGURES IT WAS COMING DOWN LIKE A STONEMENT 
YOU WERE AT FORTY THREE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN YOU DIDN'T ARGUE ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T GOING 
TO CHANGE POLICY YOU WERE GOING TO 
STICK TO MY FIGURES 
YOU HAD NO POLICY OTHER THAN YOU 
WERE GOING TO STICK TO MY FIGURES 
LET ME REPLY YOU MADE A SILLY 
POINT TWICE 
HE STUCK TO MY FIGURES AND AND 
THERE WAS ACOM BOOM IN AMERICA BY 
NOT CHANGING ANYTHING ON TAX AND 
SPEND HE HAD REMARKABLE FALL IN 
DEBT WHICH GAVE US A TREMENDOUS 
PROSPECT FOR THE FUTURE OF KEEPING 
GROWTH AND WITH LOW INFLATION 
INFLATION GROWING INDEFINITELY IN 
TWO THOUSAND HE HAD A CHANGE OF MIND 
SUDDENLY HE BECAME WHAT HE 
REMAINED GORDON BROWN A TAX AND 
SPEND CHANCELLOR 
AND IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT YOUR 
PERSONAL DEBTS AND HU A BANK 
MANAGER LOOKING AT THAT HE WOULD 
TELL NEW THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND YOU MADE A 
SILLY MISTAKE THE PROJECTION ARE 
VIRTUALLY INCREDIBLE NOW ALL IT 
REQUIRES IS THE SLOWDOWN OF THE 
ECONOMY TO BE AS BAD AS PEOPLE 
THINK IT IS AND THAT RIGHT HAND END 
WILL NOT FLATTEN OUT 
MARGARET HODGE HE LOOKS AS IF HE 
IS GOING TO BUST HIS OWN FORTY PER CENT RULE 
ISN'T IT 
NO HE IS NOT GOING TO 
BUST THE FORTY PER CENT RULE 
HE WON'T BUST THE RULE HE SAID 
CLEARLY YESTERDAY HE WON'T BUST THE 
RULE RULE HE WILL RAISE TAX 
IF WE ARE GOING TO BE A COMPETITIVE 
ECONOMY IN A GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT 
INVESTING IN EDUCATION SCHOOLS 
UNIVERSITIES TRANSPORT WHICH IS 
WHERE THE EXPENDITURE IS HUGELY 
IMPORTANT AND WHEN WE CAME IN WHEN 
WE CAME IN KEN YOU KNOW WE CAME 
WHEN DEBT WAS HIGHER AND WE CAME IN 
WHEN PUBLIC SPENDING IT WAS AT FORTY THREE PER CENT 
THE FIGURES LET'S GET TO REALITY 
HERE THE FIGURE IS MASSIVELY BUST 
BECAUSE THE 
NO IT IS NOT JENNY'S JENNY'S GRAPH DOES NOT INCLUDE THE BILLIONS 
AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF POUNDS 
THAT HE PUT OFF BUDGET ALL THE 
PFIS NETWORK RAIL NORTHERN ROCK 
PENSIONS HE IS WAY OVER THE FORTY PER CENT 
IS HE GOING TO RAISE TAXES OR CUT 
SPENDING WHICH IS HE GOING TO DO 
AND WHERE IS HE GOING TO DO IT 
JUST ON THAT ECONOMISTS ARE ALWAYS 
BAD AT PREDIGGING THE FUTURE 
PREDICTING THE FUTURE 
GORDON IS HOPELESS AT IT 
KEN IS SAYING THAT THE ECONOMY IS 
GOING TO GO DOWN BY THE END OF THE 
YEAR WE WILL FIND GROWTH STARTING 
COMING BACK INTO THE ECONOMY AGAIN 
AND I THINK THAT PUTTING MORE MONEY 
INTO THE ECONOMY TODAY WHICH IS 
WHAT HE DID BY HIS MEASURES 
YESTERDAY WILL HELP ACTUALLY 
ECONOMISTS AREN'T AS BAD AS 
PREDICTING THE FUTURE WE CAN'T 
AGREE ON THE PAST 
WE WERE STILL ARGUING ABOUT 
INFLATION LAST YEAR 
THE PRIME MINISTER IS SET TO 
UPSTAGE THE QUEEN FOR THE SECOND 
YEAR RUNNING IN A ROW WHEN HE 
OUTLINES HIS PLANS FOR THE QUEEN'S 
SPEECH AND THE YEAR AHEAD THIS 
MORNING STRAIGHT AFTER PRIME 
MINISTER'S QUESTION TIME THE 
PUBLICATION OF HIS DRAFT 
LEGISLATION PROGRAMME IS DESIGNED 
TO REGAIN THE POLITICAL INITIATIVE 
BUT WILL THE PLANS BE ENOUGH TO 
MOVE ON FROM THE TEN PENCE TAX ROW 
AND THE KICKING HE GOT IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS WE WILL BRING YOU NOT 
THE QUEEN'S SPEECH TO YOU LIVE 
LATER THIS MORNING WHAT SHALL WE 
BE LOOKING OUT FOR JUST AS IT 
SEEMED THAT DAVID CAMERON MIGHT OF 
SLAIN THE NEW LABOUR MONSTER 
SOMETHING SEEMS TO BE STIRRING IN 
SOMETHING SEEMS TO BE STIRRING IN WESTMINSTER WESTMINSTER THE FEARSOME BEAST THAT IS GORDON 
BROWN CONTINUES HIS FIGHTBACK 
TODAY TODAY MEASURES ARE EXPECTED TO INCLUDE 
REFORMS TO THE REGULATION OF THE 
BANKING SYSTEM IN THE WAKE OF THE 
NORTHERN ROCK NIGHTMARE TO TACKLE 
PROBLEMS IN THE HOUSING MARKET HE 
IS EXPECT TODAY EXTEND LAST YEAR'S 
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE MORE 
AFFORDABLE HOMES HE WILL PROBABLY 
RECOMMEND THE GOLDSMITH REVIEW AS 
WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION OF 
STATEMENT OF RIGHTS AND SPOGHTS 
SPOGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES IT HAS 
BEEN SUGGESTED THAT HE WILL ENABLE 
A MORE PERSONALISED APPROACH TO 
HEALTH AND EDUCATION AND THE BIG 
LABOUR BEAST IS EXPECTED TO GIVE 
MOTHERS MORE RIGHTS TO FLEXIBLE 
WORKING CONDITIONS BUT WILL ALL 
THIS BE ENOUGH TO APPEASE LABOUR 
M. P.'S WHO ARE HUNGRY FOR BLOOD 
LET'S SPEAK TO JOHN MANN HE 
OUTLINED A TEN POINT PLAN THAT HE 
THINKS THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD 
ADOPT GIVE US THE HIGH LIGHTS OF 
YOUR PLAN 
WE NEED TO KEEP CUTTING TAXES 
BRING IN IDENTITY CARDS AND BREAK 
DEPENDENCY WELFARE AM VERY 
CONFIDENT THERE IS GOING TO BE 
SPACE FOR BACKBENCHERS LIKE ME TO 
HAVE SERIOUS INFLUENCE WE ARE 
THE ONES WHO HAVE JUST PERSUADED 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND CHANCELLOR 
OF THE TEN PENCE TAX IT IS PEOPLE 
LIKE ME WHO PERSUADED THAT THEY HAD 
NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE ACTION NOW 
IT SOUNDS VERY MUCH LIKE MOVE 
TOWARDS THE RIGHT WHEN YOU TALK 
ABOUT CUTTING TAXES DO YOU THINK 
THAT IS WHERE LABOUR NEEDS TO BE TO 
WIN THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTE 
IT IS NOT A MOVE TO THE RIGHT IT 
IS A MOVE TOWARDS WHAT HAD WORKING 
PEOPLE HARD WORKING PEOPLE WANT 
TO SEE AREAS LIKE MIGHT REPRESENT 
THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY WHAT 
PEOPLE WANT IS SENSE OF FAIRNESS 
I DO FIND FOUND US NOW AS BEING 
AS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO HAVE LOWER 
TAXES BUT AS WELL DEALING WITH 
PEOPLE'S IRRATIONAL FEARS ABOUT 
SECURITY ONE OF MY PROPOSALS ON 
IDENTITY CARDS IS THAT THERE SHOULD 
BE AN IDENTITY CARD FOR EVERYBODY 
IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IS INCREDIBLY 
POPULAR BECAUSE THAT IS DEALING 
WITH PEOPLE'S IRRATIONAL FEARS AS 
WELL AS THEIR RATIONAL ASPIRATIONS 
HOW EFFECTIVE LOBBYING FROM THE 
LIKES OF YOU LIKE HOW EFFECTIVE 
WERE LOBBYING FROM THE LIKES OF YOU 
BE ARE YOU GOING TO CREATE ANOTHER 
TEN PENCE TAX ROW 
I WANT A FEW THE ESCALATOR THERE 
HAS NEVER BEEN I THINK IN BRITISH 
POLITICAL HISTORY MORE OPPORTUNITY 
FOR A BACKBENCH M. P.'S ON THE 
GOVERNMENT SIDE TO HAVE INFLUENCE 
I THINK WHAT WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE 
TODAY IS THE RIGHT SIGNPOST ALMOST 
AN INVITATION FOR ROASTED CUMIN AND 
SAY HERE IS WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS 
REALLY WANT HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN A BROWN GOVERNMENT AND THE 
BLAIR GOVERNMENT ALMOST AN 
INVITATION FOR ROASTED CUMIN AND 
SAY FOUR OF US TO COME IN AND 
SAY 
VERY INTERESTING LABOUR 
BACKBENCHERS SEEM TO BE ABLE TO 
THINK THEY CAN PUSH THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER ANYWHERE 
THEY WANT MAYBE NOT JUST BACKBENCH 
M. P.'S EITHER WE ARE JOINED BY TONY 
WOODLEY GENERAL SECRETARY OF TRADE 
UNION UNITE A MEMBER OF THE 
AWKWARD SQUAD OF UNION LEADERS IS 
THERE ANYTHING IN THIS SPEECH WE 
ARE MEMBERS 
I SINCERELY HOPE THE RHYS I WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE THE PRIME MINISTER SHOW 
KIND OF VALUES THAT WE KNOW HE 
HAS HE HAS A GOOD RECORD AT 
LOOKING AFTER THE POOR AND LESS 
PRIVILEGED L. THINK WHAT HE DID 
YESTERDAY WAS NEEDED ONCE THE 
CRITICISM IS OUT OF THE WAY I 
THINK WE NEED LITTLE BIT MORE OF 
THE SAME THE RICH ARE GETTING 
RICHER AND THE POOR ARE INDEED 
GETTING POORER WE NEED A 
REDISTRIBUTION BY OUR TAX SYSTEM 
THAT ALLOWS THIS GOVERNMENT 
ULTIMATELY TO DO LITTLE BIT MORE 
FOR THE POOR IN SOCIETY 
YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THAT THERE HAS 
BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL REDISTRIBUTION 
UNDER GORDON BROWN 
NO I DO NOT ACCEPT THERE HAS BEEN 
SUFFICIENT REDISTRIBUTION OF THE 
PAST TWENTY YEARS 
YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THAT THERE HAS 
BEEN RE DISTRIBUTION UNDER GORDON 
BROWN BROWN I THINK THERE HAS BUT THERE IS NO 
DOUBT AT ALL THAT WE CAN DO MORE 
THAN WE ARE DOING IT PRESENTLY YOU 
MENTIONED THE QUEEN'S SPEECH RIGHT 
NOW WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF 
EXPLOITATION IN OUR COUNTRY 
TEMPORARY AND AGENCY WORKERS ARE 
CAUSING MAJOR PROBLEMS ON A MINIMUM 
WAGE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
LEGISLATION ON THAT L. WOULD ALSO 
LIKE TO SEE THE SITUATION WHEN WE 
TURN ROUND AND SEE OUR GOVERNMENT 
TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE GREEDY OIL 
COMPANIES WERE THE ONE OFF WINDFALL 
TAX TO OFFSET SOME OF THE FUEL 
POVERTY THAT IS IN DOWIE IN SOME OF 
THE LOWER END OF OUR COUNTRY IT 
WOULD BE IMAGINATIVE 
THE AT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY OF 
GETTING B. P. OF GOING TO PARIS CLOSED 
UP B. P. IS GLOBAL COMPANY 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES 
LEADING THIS COUNTRY THEY ARE 
GOING TO LUXEMBOURG BELGIUM 
IRELAND FOLLOW YOUR ROUTE 
THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR ANY 
COMPANY THAT ALONE ALL COMPANIES 
THERE WERE REAPING PROFITS THAT 
HAVE GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
WRONG EFFICIENCIES THERE IS NO 
JUSTIFICATION FOR BILLIONS AND 
BILLIONS TENS OF BILLIONS OF 
POUNDS EXTRA PROFIT TO BE EARNED 
WHILE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE POOR IN 
SOCIETY ARE PENSIONERS STRUGGLING 
TO PAY THEIR FUEL BILLS IT IS 
RIGHT AND PROPER THAT A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT IT IS RIGHT THEY 
SHOULD CONSIDER DOING EXACTLY THE 
SAME THING FOR A WHILE 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS I THINK MOST 
OF YOUR MEMBERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
RISING 
KNOW THAT WHEN 
THEY GO TO THE SHOPS TO BUY A IN 
MANY CASES THEIR WAGES ARE NOT 
RISING TO KEEP ABREAST OF PRICE 
RISES RISES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
WHAT ARE 
YOU GOING TO DO 
WE WILL SEEK A FAIR SHARE OF 
PROFITS IN PROFITABLE COMPANIES 
THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO MORE YOU CAN 
SEE THE DEBATE HERE NOT JUST IN 
THIS COUNTRY BUT IN AMERICA WE 
CANNOT CARRY ON JUST SEEING THE TOP 
PERCENT HERE OUR COUNTRY BECOMING 
WEALTHIER AND WEALTHIER WHILE AT 
THE BOTTOM END OF SOCIETY PEOPLE 
ARE BECOMING POORER THAT IS WHY I 
THINK REDISTRIBUTION VIA THE TAX 
SYSTEM OF SOME OF OUR WEALTH IS 
ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL 
YOUR JOB IS TO 
GET YOU PAY MEMBERS ASPECT YOUR 
MEMBERS PAY RISES NO WAY YOU'RE 
PAY RISES KEEPING PACE WITH 
INFLATION INFLATION I THINK THE GOVERNMENT COULD HELP 
US ON THIS WE CAN ONLY NEGOTIATE 
WITH THE TOOLS WE HAVE THINK WE 
DO AN EXCELLENT JOB IF YOU WERE IN 
A TRADING IN EUROPE WERE LIKELY TO 
HAVE BETTER PAINTINGS BETTER PAY 
AND IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE UNION 
FULST HE IS JOHN 
SURREY I WAS JUST TESTING 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET 
ANY OF THAT FROM GORDON BROWN AS 
GORDON BROWN PROCEEDS NOW DO YOU 
THINK HE SHOULD TAKE LABOUR INTO 
THE NEXT ELECTION AND CAN HE WON 
AT AT I HAVE GOT NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT IS 
PRIME MINISTER IF HE BREAKS AWAY 
IF HE DOES NOT CAN HE WIN THE NEXT 
ELECTION ELECTION THE IF HE BECOMES HIMSELF AND 
PUSHES AHEAD WITH THE SORT OF 
POLICY WE KNOW THIS GUY IS INVOLVED 
IN HE CAN LEAD US AND HE CAN WIN 
AN ECTION IF HE DOES NOT CHANGE 
TRACK IF HE DOES NOT CHANGE 
POLICIES THEN I DO FEAR THE WORST 
I THINK THIS GUY WILL WIN 
THE FEE DOESN'T CHANGE WHEN HE 
USED TO MAP OF THE CARRY ON UP THE 
BLAIRITE POLICIES OF THE PAST 
WHICH SEES THE POORER IN SOCIETY 
GETTING POORER IF WE CARRY ON WITH 
UNFAIR AND UNJUST AND ILLEGAL WARDS 
WE WOULD INEVITABLY 
ILLEGAL WARDS 
MARGARET HODGE YOU WILL LOSE 
UNLESS YOU HAVE A WINDFALL TAX ON 
THE OIL COMPANIES THAT YOU HAVE A 
MASSIVE REDISTRIBUTION MORE THAN 
WE HAVE HAD FROM THE APPEAL AND 
AFFLUENT TO THE POOR IS THAT GOING 
TO HAPPEN 
TONY AND I AGREE ABOUT OUR AIMS A 
MORE FAIR AND TOLERANT SOCIETY WE 
HAVE DONE A LOT OF REDISTRIBUTION 
WILL WE GET MORE 
WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO IS LIFT 
CHILDREN AT POP OUT OF POVERTY 
YOU DEFINE POVERTY VIEW ON THE 
ARGUMENT IF YOU DEFINE IT 
THAT IS NOT TRUE 
A AYR UNITED TACKLE SHELL AND B. P. 
BARRIED LYING TO ALLOW POORER 
PEOPLE TO GET PAY RISES AND EXTRA 
HELP THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO MAKE 
FOOD AND UTILITY BILLS THAT ARE 
FRANKLY GOING THROUGH THE ROOF 
FOR STUBBLE WE ARE RUN PROCESS 
IS IMPORTANT JOHN MANN AND TONY 
WOODLEY AT GIVEN VERY DIFFERENT 
POINTS OF VIEW THINK WHAT IS 
INTERESTING ABOUT THE PROCESS IS 
THEY THIS IS TIME FOR 
DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SECONDLY 
OUR AIM IS ALWAYS TO ENSURE A 
STRONG SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY AND A 
FAIR SOCIETY THAT IS WHAT WILL 
INFORM EVERY POLICY DECISION 
I AM TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT 
MEANS IN ENGLISH YOU SPEAK IN 
WESTMINSTER SPEAK WHAT DOES THAT 
MEAN MEAN WE'RE FACING A SLOWDOWN AN 
ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE INFLATION IN TWELVE MONTHS' 
INFLATION IS GOING TO BE THE BIG 
PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY WHAT WE 
ARE NOW HEARING IS FLUSHED WITH 
THEIR SUCCESS IN FORCING U. TURN 
THEY WANT MORE TAX CUTS MORE TAXES 
ON INDUSTRY THIS WOULD BE 
CATASTROPHIC IF GEORGE OSBORNE HAD 
GIVEN THAT INTERVIEW AND SAID TAX 
CUTS FOR EVERYBODY HE WAS WELL 
TO THE RIGHT OF GEORGE OSBORNE 
WE HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME L. HOPE 
YOUR MEMBERS ARE BETTER BEHAVED 
TONY WOODLEY

RELEASED HUNDREDS OF PREVIOUSLY 
CLASSIFIED REPORTS ON ALLEGED 
SIGHTINGS OF U. F. O. WAS U. F. O. ROLES 
WE HAVE BEEN TRAWLING THROUGH THESE 
FILES AND WE DID FIND ONE 
EXTRAORDINARY SIGHT IN OF A 
WESTMINSTER WE MANAGED TO ABSTAIN 
OBTAINED EXCLUSIVE VIDEO FOOTAGE 
HERE IT IS 
YES WE ALWAYS KNEW THE DAILY 
POLITICS WAS SPECIAL EAT YOUR 
HEART OUT DOCTOR WHO WE NOW KNOW 
IT IS EXTRA TERRESTRIAL AND YOU 
COULD GET YOUR HANDS ON E. T. THE MALL 
ALL YOU HAVE TO BE HIS ENTER 
OUTGUESS THE YEAR COMPETITION SEE 
IT YOU CAN REMEMBER WHEN THIS 
HAPPENED 
I HAVE BEEN CARRYING THESE SECRETS 
FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
IF YOU'RE EATING PRETZELS DUE 
BEFORE YOU SWAP SHOE BEFORE YOU 
SWALLOW 
THIS DISEASE THAT HAS CHANGED THE 
INDUSTRY FINALLY DEFEATED IT 
THE TO BE IN WITH A CHANCE OF 
WINNING SEND YOUR ANSWER TO A 
SPECIAL UNIT OR SO ARE SPECIAL 
E. MAIL ADDRESS WE CANNOT TAKE ANY 
ENTRIES AFTER TWELVE THIRTY P. M. IT IS COMING 
UP TO MIDDAY JOINING US IS THE 
TELEGRAPH POLITICAL EDITOR ANDREW 
PORTER WHERE DOES MR. CAMERON KNOW 
HOW TO BEGIN TODAY 
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO COME IN 
WITH THOSE THREE BIG MAN WORDS 
PLONK THEM ON THE TABLE AND THEN 
ASK HIM QUESTION ABOUT BURMA MEMOIRS 
THEY MUST BE SPITTING BLOOD IN 
DOWNING STREET AT ALL OF THESE 
LABOUR HAS BEEN HIS COMING FORWARD 
WHILE MR. BROWN IS STILL IN POWER 
INDEED THEY'LL COME UP ALMOST ON 
THE SAME DAY DESPITE THEY ALL CAME 
ABOUT ALMOST ON THE SAME DAY THE SPEAKER IS ABOUT TO BEGIN 
COMMENT COMEK TO THE COMMONS 
CHAMBER 
WILL MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND 
THE PRIME MINISTER WILL JOIN ME 
AND THIS HOUSE IN WISHING EVERY 
SUCCESS TO RANGERS FOOTBALL TEAM 
WE'RE JUST PROUD TO BE SCOTTISH AND 
BRITISH BRITISH 
RANGERS IN THE CUP FINAL TONIGHT 
MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND WILL BE 
AWARE THAT FIFTEEN MILLION SURVIVORS OF 
CYCLONE IN BURMA ARE FACING 
STARVATION DISEASE AND ULTIMATELY 
DEATH CAN HE TELL THIS HOUSE WHAT 
THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO GET AID 
THROUGH TO THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN 
DESPERATE NEED 
OF COURSE I THINK THE WHOLE HOUSE 
WILL WANT TO SEND THE BEST WISHES 
TO RANGERS PLAYING IN MANCHESTER 
HE RAISES POINT THAT IS TOUCHING 
THE CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD THAT 
NATURAL DISASTER IN BURMA BY THE 
ACTIONS OF A DESPICABLE REGIME HAS 
BEEN TURNED INTO HUMAN 
CATASTROPHE MAN MADE CATASTROPHE 
AS RESULT OF THEIR REACTIONS 
WHILE THERE IS DEBATE THE KEY 
THING FOR US IS TO GET AID TO THE 
PEOPLE OF BURMA AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE BE THE MEANS AVAILABLE TO 
US THAT'S WHY OVER THE LAST FEW 
HOURS A BRITISH PLANE ARRIVED IN 
RANGOON THREE OTHERS WILL ARRIVE 
SOON MORE PLANES HAVE BEEN SENT IN 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS THE FIRST PLANE 
WILL PROVIDE SHELTER FOR FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY ALSO IN THE 
THE NEXT DAY OR TWO ABOUT SIXTY 
FLIGHTS IN TOTAL WILL HAVE ARRIVED 
I. N. RANGOON THERE HAS BEEN AN 
IMPROVEMENT BUT IT IS NOT GOOD 
ENOUGH ENOUGH IT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE THE 
NEEDS OF THE BURMESE PEOPLE ARE 
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WHO FACE FAMINE 
OR DISTRESS AND IT IS NOT GOOD 
ENOUGH BECAUSE THE REGIME IS 
PREVENTING AID GETTING TO THE REST 
OF THE COUNTRY 
THAT'S WHY I ASKED BAN KI MOON THE 
GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS TO CONVENE AN EMERGENCY 
SUMMIT THAT'S WHY I ASKED HIM AND 
I BELIEVE HE IS CONSIDERING THIS 
NOW TO GO TO THE COUNTRY ITSELF 
THAT'S WHY LORD MALLET BROWN HAS 
GONE TO ASIA WHILE IT IS RIGHT 
THERE IS DEBATE AND RIGHTLY SO 
ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT 
AND ABOUT AIR DROPS THE KEY THING 
AT THE MOMENT IS TO PRESSURE THE 
REGIME BY BY ALL COUNTRIES IN ASIA 
UNITING WITH ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE 
THAT AID GETS TO THE PEOPLE OF 
BURMA AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND 
WE ARE READY TO TO DO EVERYTHING IN 
OUR POWER AND AT THE SAME TIME WE 
HAVE HUMANITARIAN TEAM IN RANGOON 
READY TO DO EVERYTHING IT CAN IN 
THE FUTURE THE HOPE THE HOUSE 
HOUSE WILL UNITE IN SAYING THE 
BURMESE REGIME MUST LET INTO THE 
COUNTRY ALL AID WORKERS AND ALL AID 
IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER I JOIN THE 
PRIME MINISTER IN WISHING RANGERS 
WELL I'M SURE HE IS RIGHT THAT THE 
WHOLE HOUSE WILL SUPPORT THAT 
WONDER WHETHER THE MEMBER WHO WAS 
HIS COLLEAGUE THE CHAIRMAN OF 
CELTIC FOOTBALL CLUB WILL TAKE THE 
SAME VIEW BUT WE WILL SEE 
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE WHOLE HOUSE 
WILL WANT TO EXPRESS OUR SYMPATHY 
FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE EARTHQUAKE 
IN SICHUAN EVERYONE WILL HAVE SEEN 
THE SWIFT RESPONSE OF THE COMIN 
EASE GOVERNMENT AND AND CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT AND IT IS STARK CONTRAST 
TO THE REGIME IN BURMA I'M 
GRATEFUL FOR THE UPDATE THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS GIVEN US AND HE 
RIGHTLY SAID THAT THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT MUST LET AID THROUGH 
BUT CAN I PUSH HIM LITTLE BIT 
MORE ON IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IS 
HE PREPARED TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS 
INCLUDING RAISING THE ISSUE OF THE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT AT THE UN 
AND SUPPORTING INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORTS TO DELIVER AID DIRECTLY 
I THANK HIM FOR THE SUPPORT FOR THE 
ACTION THAT WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN 
OF COURSE OF COURSE THE UNITED 
NATIONS WE WILL RAISE THE ISSUE OF 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT AND OF 
COURSE WE LEAVE LEAVE OURSELVES 
OPEN TO CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF AIR 
DROPS I HAVE TO SAY TO HIM HOWEVER 
THAT EVERYBODY WHO IS ON THE GROUND 
AND EVERY AID AGENCY THAT IS 
ADVISING US SAY THAT THE BEST WAY 
OF GETTING AID QUICKLY TO THE 
BURMESE PEOPLE IS TO CONTINUE THE 
PRESSURE ON THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT 
WHICH YIELDED SOME RESULTS BUT NOT 
SUFFICIENT RESULTS TO CONTINUE THAT 
PRESSURE SO THAT ASIAN COUNTRIES 
ARE IN POSITION TO HELP US GET 
THE AID THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE 
PEOPLE OF BURMA 
I HAVE TO SAY TO HIM THAT WHEN WE 
TRIED TO GET A MEETING OF THE UN 
SECURITY COUNCIL TO DISCUSS THIS 
WE HAVE BEEN BLOCKED BY OTHER 
COUNTRIES THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED 
THAT IS WHY THAT IS WHY I HAVE 
ASKED THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE 
UNITED NATIONS THAT'S WHY I ASKED 
HIM TO HOLD AN EMERGENCY SUMMIT 
SUCH AS KOFI ANNAN HELD IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND 
I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS PROGRESS ON 
THAT EMERGENCY SUMMIT AND I HOPE 
THAT IS THE MEANS MEANS BY WHICH 
ADDITIONAL PRESSURE IS BROUGHT TO 
BEAR THROUGH ASIA ON THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT I DON'T RULE OUT 
ANYTHING AND NOBODY SHOULD RULE 
RULE OUT ANYTHING LET US BE HONEST 
ALL THE AID AGENCIES AND OTHERS ARE 
TELLING US THE SAME THING WE MUST 
INTENSIFY THE PRESSURE TO GET MORE 
AID IN THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER ON DIRECT 
AID OF COURSE THE PRIME MINISTER 
IS RIGHT THAT THE BEST STEP IS TO 
GET THE GOVERNMENT TO END UP THE 
COUNTRY TO ALLOW THE AID AGENCIES 
IN BUT I THINK IT IS WORTH SET AGO 
DEADLINE BY WHICH WE SAY ENOUGH 
ISN'T THROUGH AND MORE SHOULD BE 
DONE OF COURSE THE EXPERTS SAY 
WITH DIRECT AID ONLY FIFTH WILL 
GET THROUGH BUT A FIFTH OF 
SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN ZERO PER CENT OF 
NOTHING ON THE ISSUE OF THE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT COULD HE 
CLARIFY THIS FOR US ON THIS ISSUE 
THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO THE UN 
SAID THAT THE UN'S RESPONSIBILITY 
TO PROTECT DOES NOT APPLY TO 
NATURAL DISASTERS YESTERDAY THE 
FOREIGN SECRETARY SAID IT CERTAINLY 
COULD COULD HE MAKE ABSOLUTELY 
CLEAR THAT IN OUR VIEW THE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT SHOULD BE 
EXTENDED TO BURMA AND TO BURMESE 
PEOPLE AT THIS TIME 
THERE IS TWO WAYS OF RECEIVING ALL 
THE RIGHT TO HUMANITARIAN 
INTERVENTION AND WE LEAVE ALL THE 
OPTIONS OPEN L. HAVE TO CORRECT HIM 
WE MUST NOT FALL FOR THE IMPRESSION 
THAT THERE IS SOME EASY ANSWER IN 
AID DROPS AM PREPARED I AM 
PREPARED LIKE OTHERS TO CONSIDER 
AIR DROPS BUT I HAVE HERE WHAT HAS 
BEEN SAID BY SAVE THE CHILDREN THIS 
MORNING RIGHT NOW TALK OF AID 
DROPS IS A DISTRACTION AID DROPS 
ARE AN INEFFECTIVE WAY OF OF 
DELIVERING AID WE ARE EXPLORING 
OTHER WAYS TO GET RID OF THE 
BLOCKAGES SUCH AS THROUGH BOATS 
WHAT OXFAM SAID ALSO THAT IT IS 
DISTRACTION AND THE WORLD FOOD 
PROGRAMME WHICH IS CO ORDINATING 
AID IN RANGOON SAID IT WOULD BE 
COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AND WATER 
SUPPLIES CANNOT BE DROPPED FROM THE 
AIR WITHOUT PUTTING AT RISK PEOPLE 
IN THE COUNTRY RULE OUT NOTHING 
BUT WE MUST NOT GIVE THE PUBLIC OF 
BRITAIN OR OTHER COUNTRIES THE 
IMPRESSION THAT THE BEST WAY IS NOT 
THE ONE THAT WE ARE PROPOSING AND 
THAT IS NO INTENSIFY PRESSURE ON 
THE BURMESE BURMESE GOVERNMENT AND 
TO MAKE SURE THAT AID GETS TO THE 
EEM OF BURMA PEOPLE OF BURMA 
EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS OF EVERY 
YEAR THOUSANDS OF LITTLE ANGELS ARE 
SUPPORTED BY CHILDREN'S HOSPICE 
SERVICES FUNDING LEVELS HOWEVER 
FOR THESE SERVICES ARE OFTEN FAR 
LOWER THAN COMPARATIVE SERVICES FOR 
ADULTS IN MY CONSTITUENCY MR. 
SPEAKER AN APPEAL IS SELLING 
CRYSTAL ANGELS IN ORDER TO RAISE 
FUNDS TO BUILD A HOSPICE WILL THE 
PRIME MINISTER GIVE HIS SUPPORT TO 
THIS CAMPAIGN AND ALSO TAKE STEPS 
TO IMPROVE THE FUNDING LEVELS FOR 
CHILDREN'S HOSPICES 
I DID MEET A 
DELEGATION LAST WEEK TO TALK ABOUT 
HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE FUNDING FOR 
HOSPICES WE HAVE SET ASIDE 
ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR UP TO FIVE 
YEARS WITH FUNDING OF TEN MILLION A 
YEAR UNTIL TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND WE ARE 
PUBLISHING BETTER CARE BETTER 
LIVES WHICH WAS LAUNCHED IN 
FEBRUARY BUT THIS IS A VEXED ISSUE 
FOR MANY PARENTS L. RECOGNISE THAT 
AND I KNOW GOVERNMENTS MUST DO MORE 
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT 
WHAT MORE WE CAN DO 
MR. SPEAKER YESTERDAY'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT WAS A COMPLETE CHARADE 
THE GOVERNMENT PRETENDS TO HAVE 
SOLVED THE TEN PENCE PROBLEM WHEN 
IT HASN'T THE CONSERVATIVES ONLY 
SEEM TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
EFFECT ON THEIR CHANCE INS THE BY 
ELECTION MR. SPEAKER HOW CAN THEY 
ALL IGNORE THE FACT THAT EVEN AFTER 
YESTERDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT OVER 
MILLION OF THE POOREST PEOPLE IN 
THIS COUNTRY ARE STILL WORSE OFF 
DON'T THEY MATTER 
MR. SPEAKER I'M SURPRISED AT THE 
RIGHT HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN HIS 
FORMER ACTING LEADER THE SHADOW 
CHANCELLOR WELCOMED OUR 
ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY 
THE REASON HE WELCOMED IT THAT TWENTY TWO 
MILLION PEOPLE ARE BETTER OFF AND 
NO GOVERNMENT HAS A BETTER RECORD 
IN TACKLING POVERTY THAN THIS 
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT WE HAVE TAKEN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN OUT 
OF OF POVERTY ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
CHILDREN ARE TO BE TAKEN OUT OF 
POVERTY AND ONE MILLION PENSIONERS 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF POVERTY NO 
LIBERAL POLICY WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED 
THAT THAT MR. SPEAKER THE FACT REMAINS UNDER 
A LABOUR GOVERNMENT THE WORST PAID 
ARE WORSE OFF WHY DO THEY HAVE TO 
PAY FOR HIS INCOMPETENCE THEY 
CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER SO WHEN WILL 
HE COME BACK TO THIS HOUSE WITH 
SPECIFIC PROPOSALS TO COMPENSATE IN 
FULL THE MILLION PEOPLE HE HAS BE 
TROID TROID BETRAYED 
WE HAVE SAID WE WILL 
COME BACK IN THE PRE BUDGET REPORT 
HE MUST NOT FORGET THE FACT THAT 
EVERY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY WHO IS 
AN INCOME TAX PAIR AT THE PAYER 
AT THE BASIC RATE TWENTY TWO MILLION 
PEOPLE WILL RECEIVE THAT MONEY 
HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THERE ARE TWO 
WILL RECEIVE TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
WE HAVE DONE 
WHAT WE SAID WE WILL DO TO OFF SET WILL SOON HAVE A NEW 
HEALTH CENTRE WHERE WHERE G. P.'S WILL 
BE WORKING TOGETHER TO PROVIDE AND 
EXTEND ACCESS TO THE INDIVIDUALS IN 
MY CONSTITUENCY 
WOULD MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND 
COMMENT OR INDEED AGREE THAT THE 
PROPOSALS MADE BY SOME TO LIMIT THE 
CONTRACT THAT WAS ALREADY MADE WITH 
G. P.'S FOR WEEKEND AND EVENING ACCESS 
WOULD THAT NOT 
ORDER ORDER IT IS 
TOO LONG IT IS TOO LONG 
YOU ARE RIGHT TO POINT OUT TO THE 
ADVANCES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN G. P.'S 
SERVICES IN THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE 
WEEKEND OPENING IN PLACES THAT 
THERE WASN'T WEEKEND OPENING BEFORE 
THERE IS MORE G. P. ACCESS FOR AFTER 
HOUR SERVICES WHERE THERE WASN'T IN 
THE EVENINGS BEFORE THE PARTY THAT 
WOULD PUT THIS AT RISK IS THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO SAYS THEY 
WOULD BACK TRACK ON THE PROMISE 
THAT HAS BEEN MADE AND VOTED ON GI 
G. P.'S G. P.'S BY G. P.'S 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAK YESTERDAY IT 
WAS REVEALED IN PRIVATE THE HOUSING 
MINISTER TOLD THE CABINET THAT 
HOUSE PRICES WOULD FALL UP TO TEN PER CENT 
HOUSE BUILDING WAS STALLING AND 
FURTHER FALLS ARE PREDICTED YET IN 
PUBLIC THE SAME MINISTER SAID THAT 
THE HOUSING MARKET WAS STRONG DOES 
THE PRIME MINISTER AGREE THAT SHE 
WASN'T BEING STRAIGHT WITH PEOPLE 
BECAUSE OF THE CONDITION OF THE 
HOUSING MARKET THAT I WILL BE 
ANNOUNCING NEW MEASURES LATER ON IN 
THIS QUESTION TIME WHEN I DO MY 
STATEMENT AND THE REASON IS THAT 
THE HOUSING SITUATION HAS 
DETERIORATED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS 
AND WHILE WE ARE TAKING THE 
MEASURES WE ARE DOING IS TO PROTECT 
FIRST TIME BUYERS AND GIVE THEM NEW 
OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE OUT STOCK 
THAT IS NOT BEING BOUGHT SO THAT 
HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER 
AUTHORITIES CAN BUY IT AND HELP 
PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING REPOSSESSION 
THE THOUGHT THE OPPOSITION WOULD 
SUPPORT THAT BUT MAYBE THEY DON'T 
REMEMBER THAT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THEY 
CAUSED THE BIGGEST REPOSSESSIONS WE 
HAVE EVER SEEN IN OUR HISTORY 
MR. SPEAKER PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR 
ABOUT THE FUTURE AND PEOPLE WANT 
SOME ANSWERS 
AND PEOPLE WANT SOME ANSWERS FROM 
THE PRIME MINISTER YESTERDAY WE 
ALL PAID TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION TO KEEP THE 
PRIME MINISTER IN HIS JOB THE 
LEAST HE CAN DO IS EARN IT BY 
ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS 
DOESN'T HE UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS 
NEVER GOING TO GET OUT OF THE HOLE 
THAT HE DUG FOR HIMSELF UNLESS HE 
STARTS BEING STRAIGHT WITH PEOPLE 
IN ALL OTHER WALKS OF LIFE IF 
SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THE BOSS WOULD HAVE SAID THEY 
SHOULDN'T OF DONE HAS THE TIMING 
OF THE TAX ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY 
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BY 
ELECTION 
AS THE CHANCELLOR SAID ELECTION YESTERDAY HE HAD TO BRING FORWARD 
HIS PROPOSALS IF THEY WERE TO GO 
INTO THE FINANCE BILL TO BE 
LEGISLATED NOW 
NOW I THOUGHT THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY WOULD WELCOME OUR 
ANNOUNCEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE HAVE 
BENEFITED BUT THEY HAVE NOT EVEN 
TOLD US YET WHETHER THEY SUPPORT 
OUR PLAN 
AND MR. SPEAKER THE REASON IS THIS 
THAT THEIR TAX PRIORITIES ARE 
FURTHER CUTS ARE IN INHERITANCE TAX 
STAMP DUTY ON SHARES GIVING MONEY 
TO THE PEOPLE ALREADY RICH THEY 
HAVE NEVER AT ANY TIME SAID THEIR 
PRIORITY IS THE LOW PAID AND 
POOREST MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY 
THAT IS THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT 
CAUSED FIFTEEN PER CENT INTEREST RATES THREE 
MILLION UNEMPLOYED AND WE WILL 
NEVER FORGET THE RECORD 
REPOSSESSIONS THAT HAPPENED WHEN HE 
WAS ADVISOR ADVISOR TO THE 
CHANCELLOR CHANCELLOR SO THERE WE HAVE IT 
THE CAT 
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE 
GENTLEMAN ORDER 
THE CANCELLED ELECTION HAD NOTHING 
TO DO WITH THE POLLS AND THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY HAD NOTHING 
TO DO WITH THE BY ELECTION ANOTHER 
DAY ANOTHER COMPLETE FAILURE TO BE 
STRAIGHT WITH PEOPLE LET'S TRY 
ANOTHER ONE LAST WEEK THE PRIME 
MINISTER CLAIMED THAT WENDY 
ALEXANDER WASN'T CLAIMING WASN'T 
CALLING FOR AN EARLY RUM ON 
SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE WILL HE 
ADMIT SHE WAS CALLING FOR AN EARLY 
REFERENDUM AND ON THIS ISSUE THEY 
SIMPLY DON'T AGREE CAN HE TAKE 
THIS ONE CHANCE TO BE STRAIGHT WITH 
PEOPLE 
I WROTE TO THEM LAST WEEK TO POINT 
ADDED THAT THERE IS NO PLAN FOR A 
THERE IS NO PLAN FOR A REFERENDUM 
IN SCOTLAND THERE IS NO PLAN TO 
PUT LEGISLATION THROUGH THE 
SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT NOW OR IN THE 
IMMEDIATE FUTURE THOUGHT THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY WOULD WANT TO 
JOIN TOGETHER WITH THE LABOUR PARTY 
IN SUPPORTING THE UNION THOUGHT 
THEY WOULD WANT TO SUPPORT THE 
INTEGRITY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
AGAINST THE NATIONALIST PARTIES 
BUT ALL WE HAVE IS PETTY POINTS 
SCORING WHEN WHAT WE WANT IS 
DEFENCE OF THE UNION 
WENDY ALEXANDER CALLED FOR AN EARLY 
REFERENDUM SAYING BRING IT ON 
BIPLANE GAINS FOR AN EARLY 
REFERENDUM AT TIME WHEN WENDY 
ALEXANDER AND THE PRIME MINISTER 
ARE THE TWO MOST UNPOPULAR 
POLITICIANS ON THE PLANET ISN'T A 
BIG PART OF THE DISASTERS 
PREMIERSHIP HIS FAILURE TO BE 
STRAIGHT WITH PEOPLE HE WILL NOT 
BE STRAIGHT ABOUT THE ELECTION 
ABOUT THE EUROPEAN TREATY THAT THE 
TEN PENCE TAX LOSERS AND EVEN THE 
ONE THING PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WOULD 
CARE ABOUT THE UNION HE WILL NOT 
BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT AREN'T WE 
SEEING A PRIME MINISTER PUTTING 
SHORT TERM DECISIONS IN FRONT OF 
THE NATIONAL INTEREST 
IT IS THE RIGHT HONOURABLE 
GENTLEMAN THAT IS PLAYING POLITICS 
HE NEVER TOLD US WHETHER THE 
SUPPORT OF OUR TAX PACKAGE HE DOES 
NOT TELL US NOW WHETHER WE ARE 
SUPPORTING US ON THE UNION IT IS 
ABOUT TIME INSTEAD OF BEING 
SALESMAN HE STARTED TO SHINE SOME 
SUBSTANCE OF THAT POLICY WE ARE 
THE PARTY HELPING TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE 
WE HAD A PARTY WITH RECORD 
EMPLOYMENT FIGURES WE ARE THE 
PARTY TAKING MORE PEOPLE AT THE 
POVERTY WE ARE EXPANDING THE 
NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE HIS PARTY 
WOULD PUT THAT AT RISK 
CAN I TELL THE PRIME MINISTER THAT 
FOREIGN INVESTMENT INTO YORKSHIRE 
AND HUMBER HAS INCREASED BY 
STAGGERING EIGHTY PER CENT IN THE LAST TWELVE 
MONTHS THAT IS MAINLY THANKS TO 
THE SOUND ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THIS 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT AND THE GOOD 
OFFICES OF YORKSHIRE FORWARD WILL 
THE PRIME MINISTER JOINED ME IN 
CONGRATULATING BARNES THE COMPANY 
ON WINNING THE BEST EXPORTER OF THE 
YEAR AWARD 
AND GRATEFUL TO MY HONOURABLE 
FRIEND CHAMPION OF NEW INDUSTRY 
FOR YORKSHIRE WANT TO 
CONGRATULATE THE GROUP ON THE WORK 
IT DOES THE FACT IS EVEN IN 
DIFFICULT WORLD SITUATIONS WHEN 
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN RISING AND 
OTHER COUNTRIES EMPLOYMENT IN 
BRITAIN HAS RISEN TO TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE THERE HAVE NO HAVE A 
MILLION MORE PEOPLE IN EMPLOYMENT 
THAN THERE WAS YEAR AGO WE DO 
NOT SHIRK FROM THE NECESSITY OF 
INTERVENING TO PROTECT SAFEGUARD 
AND ADVANCED JOBS IN THE ECONOMY I 
HOPE OTHER PARTIES WILL JOIN US 
SO INTO THE LEADER OF THE 
OPPOSITION HAS CONFESSED TO 
BREAKING HIS POLICY OF IN JUDY 
POLITICS DOES HE BELIEVE THIS IS 
THE BEST WAY TO HOLD HIS 
POLITICIANS DO ACCOUNT 
YES I HOPE THERE WILL BE A 
VIGOROUS DEBATE ON OUR LEGISLATIVE 
PROGRAMME WILL MEET PUT IT FORWARD 
I HOPE THERE WILL BE DEBATE IN 
THIS HOUSE AND IN ALL PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING 
THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO MAKE 
DECISIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE 
COUNTRY COUNTRY TEMPORARY WORKERS ARE BEING 
EXPLOITED FOR YEARS WITH LOW WAGES 
LONGER DAYS AT WORK AND BAD 
CONDITIONS ATROCIOUS CONDITIONS 
WOULD THE PRIME MINISTER THINK OF 
BRINGING LEGISLATION FORWARD TO 
GIVE THESE WORKERS SOME REAL RIGHT 
THERE IS GENERAL WORRY IN ALL 
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY A BAD 
VULNERABLE WORKERS ABOUT THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO AT TEMPORARY WORKERS WHO 
WERE NOT GIVEN PROPER PROTECTION 
HOPE HE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE 
DRAFT LEGISLATIVE STATEMENT 
LISTENING TO THE PRIME MINISTER YOU 
COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING WE 
ARE LIVING IN SOME KIND OF UTOPIA 
CANNAE TELL US IF HE HAS MADE ANY 
MISTAKES RECENTLY 
I DID SAY THAT THE TEN P. WE SHOULD 
HAVE DONE THINGS BETTER L. MADE 
THAT CLEAR AT THE TIME WHAT I AM 
NOT GOING TO DO IS MAKE THE 
MISTAKES THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
MADE FIFTEEN PER CENT INTEREST RATES 
INFLATION AT TEN PER CENT THREE MILLION PEOPLE 
UNEMPLOYED AND RECORD REPOSSESSIONS 
THE PUBLICATION NEXT MONTH OF THESE 
REGIONAL SPATIAL STRATEGY WILL 
CONTAIN PROPOSALS FOR MORE THAN 
SIXTY THOUSAND HOUSES IN GRADY NOT 
GREAT AND NOTTINGHAMSHIRE WOULD 
THE PRIME MINISTER IS SURE THAT 
DEVELOPMENT TAKES PLACE ON 
BROWNFIELD BEFORE GREEN FIELD SITES 
AND THAT HIGH PROPORTION OF THESE 
NEW HOMES BUILT TOO HARD WORKING 
FAMILIES THROUGH SOCIAL HOUSING 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOUSING BUILT 
IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN ON 
BROWNFIELD LAND THAT IS HOW WE 
INTEND TO CONTINUE EQUALLY YOU 
WANT IS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS 
IN THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE GET THEIR 
FIRST RUNG ON THE HOUSING LADDER L. 
HOPE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE 
PROPOSALS WE PUT FORWARD AT TO 
BUILD SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN HIS AREA AND 
ELSEWHERE I HOPE HE WILL WELCOME 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT BE MADE LATER 
TODAY ABOUT MORE FUNDS FOR HOUSING 
THE UNITED KINGDOM MOTORIST IS THE 
MOST HIGHLY TAXED IN THE WORLD 
WILL THE PRIME MINISTER LISTEN TO 
THE MOTORISTS OF THIS COUNTRY 
BECAUSE MANY AREAS PARTICULARLY 
RURAL AREAS INCLUDING IN MY 
CONSTITUENCY OF MACCLESFIELD THERE 
IS VERY LITTLE IF ANY PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT AND A MOTOR VEHICLE IS 
ESSENTIAL WE REVIEW NOW THE 
PROPOSALS CONTAINED IN THE BUDGET 
DRAMATICALLY TO INCREASE THE 
VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY WHICH IS 
UNFAIR AND PENALISES THE RURAL 
AREAS OF THIS COUNTRY 
MR. SPEAKER I PICK SERIOUSLY THE 
NEEDS OF MOTORISTS IN THIS COUNTRY 
BUT I THINK WHEN HE LOOKS AT THE 
PROPOSALS THE MAJORITY OF 
MOTORISTS ARE THE VICTIMS HAVE NO 
MORE EXCISE DUTY AS A RESULT OF 
THESE PROPOSALS L. THINK HE SHOULD 
LOOK AT WHAT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE TRANSPORT GROUP SAID 
STEVEN NORRIS WE SAID UNDER THE 
TORIES YOU WILL PAY MORE IN GREEN 
TAXES YOU WILL SEE THE 
REINTRODUCTION OF FUEL DUTY 
ESCALATOR HE SHOULD BE TALKING TO 
HIS CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES ABOUT 
THEIR MISTAKES 
AND I WELCOME THE GOVERNMENT'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT THIS WEEK OF THE A 
REVIEW INTO THE SERVICES FOR SOCIAL 
CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED 
THE ALL PARTY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOOK 
IS CONDUCTING ITS OWN INQUIRY INTO 
SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY TWO 
THEMES ARE EMERGING FIRSTLY THAT 
THERE SHOULD BE A BASIC ENTITLEMENT 
FOR THE ELDERLY TO RECEIVE SOCIAL 
CARE SECONDLY THAT WHERE THEY 
RECEIVE SOCIAL CARE THEY SHOULD BE 
TREATED AS INDIVIDUALS WITH THE 
WRONG PERSONAL BUDGETS SO THEY CAN 
MAKE THE WRONG CHOICES ABOUT THEIR 
OWN LIVES 
THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT 
THE DEBATE IS ABOUT LAUNCHING THE 
DEBATE ON SOCIAL CARE ON MONDAY I 
WAS ABLE TO SAY THAT WE WOULD 
INCREASE RISING DEMANDS ELDERLY 
PEOPLE WANT BETTER CHOICES AND 
BETTER OPPORTUNITIES IN OLD AGE TO 
MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES FOR 
THEMSELVES WE EXPECT OVER SEVENTEEN 
MILLION TO HAVE THE NEED FOR CARE 
AND SUPPORT THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS L. 
HOPE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO GET A 
CONSENSUS ON FUTURE FUNDING WE 
WILL BE PUBLISHING OUR PROGRAMME 
FOR A CURIOUS AND THE NEXT FEW 
WEEKS THAT BUT ON CARERS 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER CONFIRM HE 
IS VISITING CREWE AND NANTWICH AND 
THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS 
NO I CANNOT I CANNOT 
THAT IS WHERE THERE IS A BY 
ELECTION ELECTION WILL THE PRIME MINISTER ASSURE US 
THAT HE WILL NOT TAKE ANY LESSONS 
FROM PEOPLE WHO CREATED TWO 
RECESSIONS THREE MILLION AND WIDE FIFTY 
PER CENT OF MORTGAGE RATE HE SLASHED 
PUBLIC SERVICES DOUBLE EIGHT 
NATIONAL DEBT AND TREBLE THE NUMBER 
OF CHILDREN IN POVERTY STICK TO 
PRUDENT NOT EMPTY PROMISES THAT THAT IS WHAT THE DEBATE IN THIS COUNTRY 
IS ACTUALLY ABOUT WHEN WE DEBATED 
NORTHERN ROCK WE WERE PREPARED TO 
INTERVENE THE CONSERVATIVES BACK 
THE WAVE MET WE ARE PREPARED TO 
GIVE MORE MONEY TO PEOPLE WITH TWENTY TWO 
MILLION PEOPLE BENEFITING YESTERDAY 
WE STILL DO NOT HAVE AN ANSWER FROM 
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
THERE ARE THE PARTY OF RECORD 
MORTGAGE REPOSSESSIONS THE COUNTRY 
WILL NOT FORGET 
MR. SPEAKER WHEN THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S PREDECESSOR TONY BLAIR 
MET THE DALAI LAMA IN MET HIM IN 
DOWNING STREET WHEN HIS 
PREDECESSOR JOHN MAJOR MET THE 
DALAI LAMA HE MET HIM IN DOWNING 
STREET WILL THE PRIME MINISTER 
CONFIRM THAT WHEN HE MEETS THE 
DALAI LAMA HE WILL DO SO IN 
DOWNING STREET 
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT PART OF 
WESTMINSTER WE NEED BUT WHAT ISSUES 
ARE DISCUSSED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF 
TIBET I AM MEETING THE DALAI LAMA 
WITH THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
I AM ALSO ATTENDING AT LAMBETH 
PALACE A CONFERENCE OF FAITH GROUPS 
INVOLVING THE DALAI LAMA ALL THE 
ISSUES OF SUBSTANCE RELATING TO OUR 
VIEWS ON WHAT IS HAPPENING INTO BED 
WILL BE DISCUSSED AND ON THE TABLE 
WE WILL BE PRESSING THE DALAI LAMA 
TO JOIN US IN FACILITATING 
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE TIBETANS THAT 
IS THE WAY FORWARD IT IS HIS USE 
OF SUBSTANCE THAT MATTER ISSUES 
WHAT MESSAGE DOES THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAVE FOR THE THOUSANDS OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE SITTING GCSE 
EXAMS THIS WEEK WHEN HE JOINED ME 
IN CONGRATULATING TEACHERS IN MY 
CONSTITUENCY WHERE STUDENTS 
ACHIEVING FIVE A OR TO SEEK HAVE 
RISEN FROM A FORTY FOUR TOOK SEVENTY FOUR PER CENT ON THE 
THIS BOMB AT 
HIS GOVERNMENT THIS IS ANOTHER 
MEASURE THE PROGRESS BEING MADE IN 
THIS COUNTRY LET ME JUST SAY THAT 
THE PROPOSALS EDNA'S FORWARD FOR 
THE NEXT YEAR OUR EDUCATION TO A 
TEAM OPPOSED BY THE CONSERVATIVE 
EDUCATIONAL MAINTENANCE ALLOWANCES 
EXTENDED OPPOSED BY THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY EXPANSION OF 
THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS PROGRAMME 
WHERE THEY CAN SEND US WHAT TO TAKE 
MONEY FROM IT IF WE WANT 
INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION IT CAN ONLY 
HAPPEN UNDER LABOUR 
HER NEW LONDON MAYOR IS OFF TO A 
COURAGEOUS START 
TALKING ABOUT 
BORIS JOHNSON 
ONLY NINE DAYS INTO OFFICE HE IS 
ALREADY TAKEN ON THE SCOURGE OF 
YOUTH CRIME HE IS SCRAPPING THE 
LONDON EYE NEWSPAPER AND INSTEAD 
PLANTING TEN THOUSAND TREES THE PRIME 
MINISTER TALKS ABOUT COURAGE HE 
HAS EVEN WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT 
BUT WHEN HE IS EAGER TO PLUCK UP 
THE COURAGE TO PLUCK WHEN HE'S 
THE GUY TO PLUCK UP THE COURAGE TO 
CALL BORIS IN PERSON AND 
CONGRATULATE HIM 
WHEN THE MAYOR OF 
LONDON CAME LAST WEEK TO THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS I DID CONGRATULATE HIM 
WHAT I ALSO SAID IS HE WILL BE 
JUDGED BY HIS RECORD HE HAS GOT TO 
SHOW WE CAN EXPAND TRANSPORT 
EXPAND POLICING AND DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN LONDON 
THAT IS HOW HE WILL BE JUDGED 
FREE NATIONAL BUS TRAVEL FOR OLDER 
PEOPLE WAS GREATLY APPRECIATED BY 
MY CONSTITUENTS HOWEVER THEY WERE 
LESS DELIGHTED WHEN THEY WERE TOLD 
BY WEST LANCASHIRE DISTRICT COUNCIL 
THAT IF THEY USE THAT FREE BUS 
SERVICE THEY WOULD NO LONGER BE 
AND HAVE FREE LOCAL RAIL TRAVEL ON 
WHITE PEOPLE IN THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES NEAR BY WHAT CAN THE 
PRIME MINISTER DO TO ENSURE THAT 
WHEN GOVERNMENT GIVES TORY LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES DO NOT TAKE AWAY 
I DO APPLAUD HER CAMPAIGN ON BEHALF 
OF THE ELDERLY PEOPLE FOR A 
CONSTITUENCY I CAN CONFIRM THAT 
WEST LANCASHIRE WAS ALLOCATED A 
GRANT OF ALMOST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO PAY FOR 
THE NEW ENGLAND CONCESSION IN 
TRANSPORT I AM CONFIDENT IT IS 
SUFFICIENT TO MEET THEIR NEEDS 
WHICH COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES 
DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE ARE WE APPLYING 
ON THEM 
I THINK IT WOULD BE IN OUR 
INTERESTS TO APPLY THAT PRESSURE 
RATHER THAN NAME NAMES IF I MAY 
SAY SO THE PRESSURE ON THESE 
COUNTRIES CONTINUES THAT IS WHY 
ARE ALSO AT CALL THEM CALLED ON 
THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY SUMMIT 
HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE HELD ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY THAT WOULD GET THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ORGANISED 
SO WE CAN GET AID TO BURMA WE WILL 
AIM TO GET A CONCERTED 
INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE 
MY CONSTITUENCY IN BRENT SOUTH HAS 
BEEN DESCRIBED AS MANY THINGS BUT 
ONE OF THE MOST OFFENSIVE IS BROKEN 
MY COMMUNITY IN BRENT IS NOT BROKEN 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THIS GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED 
DOUBLE MATERNITY PAY AND PIONEER IN 
MATERNITY LEAVE IS IT NOW TIME TO 
REVIEW THESE MEASURES 
I HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD 
WITH OUR PLANS ON MATERNITY PAY AND 
MATERNITY RIGHTS OVER THE COURSE OF 
THE PARLIAMENT L. HOLD ALL PARTIES 
IN THIS HOUSE WILL COME TO THE VIEW 
THAT PATERNITY LEAVE WAS A GOOD 
THING IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT WHILE 
THE CONSERVATIVES IN PRESENT 
THEMSELVES AS FAMILY FRIENDLY THEY 
VOTED AGAINST THE EXTENSION OF 
MATERNITY LEAVE POST PATERNITY 
LEAVE AND A POLL AS FLEXIBLE 
WORKING 
STATEMENT THE PRIME WORKING MINISTER 
IN THIS STATEMENT I WILL FOCUS ON 
HOW WE'RE STEERING THROUGH THE 
CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 
AND ALSO THE CHANGES INCLUDING A 
NEW EDUCATION AND SKILLS BILL 
NEEDED TO MAKE BRITAIN A MORE FAIR 
AND PROSPEROUS SOCIETY OUR 
IMMEDIATE PRIORITY FOR THE COMING 
SESSION AT TIME WHEN FOOD AND 
FUEL PRICES ARE RISING AND 
MORTGAGES ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO 
OBTAIN IS TO HELP FAMILY FINANCES 
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS RULES SET OUT 
THE ELEMENTS OF OUR ECONOMIC PLAN 
AS WE STEER OUR WAY THROUGH THE 
GLOBAL CREDIT CRUNCH AND 
INTERNATIONAL OIL AND FOOD PRICE 
RISES IT WILL INCLUDE A BANKING 
BILL SO BRITAIN UNDERPINS ITS 
BANKING SYSTEM AND IN ADDITION TO 
ACTION WE WILL TAKE ON FUEL BILLS 
AND INTERNATIONALLY ON OIL PRICES 
AND FOOD PRICES AND THE BENEFIT WE 
GAIN FROM STABILITY THAT NOW COVER 
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WORKERS MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND THE HOUSING 
MINISTER IS TODAY ANNOUNCING 
TWO HUNDRED MILLION BOND REALLOCATING 
MONEY TO PURCHASE UNSOLD HOMES AND 
BRENDAN TO SOCIAL TENANTS WERE TO 
MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ON SHARED 
OWNERSHIP BASIS THIS WILL ALLOW 
MORE FIRST TIME BUYERS TO PURCHASE 
NEWLY BUILT HOMES ON THE OPEN 
MARKET THE 
QUEEN'S SPEECH 
WILL ALSO 
INTRODUCE A SAVINGS BILL NOT JUST 
TO HELP HOME OWNERSHIP BUT WEALTH 
OWNERSHIP GENERALLY GIVING EIGHT 
MILLION PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES 
ACCESS TO A NATIONAL SAVINGS SCHEME 
SCHEME WITH EACH POUND SAVED 
MATCHED BY C. B. S. BY THE GOVERNMENT 
AND WE WILL LOOK ON HOUSING AT 
WHETHER FURTHER ACTION IS REQUIRED 
IN THE LIGHT OF THE STUDY BY THE 
OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING INTO THE 
SALE AND LEASE BACK MARKET AND THE 
RISE IN SECOND CHARGE MORTGAGES TO 
ENSURE WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN AND THAT 
IS THAT CUSTOMERS ARE TREATED 
FAIRLY FAIRLY WITH THE SECOND PUBLIC SECTOR 
EFFICIENCY REVIEW UNDERWAY WE ARE 
SETTING THE OBJECTIVE FOR VALUE FOR 
MONEY AS WE MOVE TO ACHIEVETED 
LOWEST CIVIL SERVICE NUMBERS SINCE 
SINCE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE THE GOVERNMENT WILL 
CONSULT THE IDEA OF REGULATORY 
BUDGETS FOR THE FIRST TIME GIVING 
DEPARTMENTS THAT SEEK NEW 
REGULATION A STRICT ANNUAL LIMIT ON 
WHAT THEY CAN IMPOSE 
AS WELL AS TAKING ACTION TO HELP 
FAMILIES IN BUSINESS THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS DUTY TO EQUIP THIS 
COUNTRY TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF 
THE FURTHER 
IN THE THE EDUCATION HEALTH AND 
POLICE BILLS WE ARE ANNOUNCING A 
COMMITMENT TO NEW STANDARDS OF 
EXCELLENCE IN SERVICES TO THE 
TRANSFER OF MORE POWER AND 
RESOURCES TO PARENTS PATIENTS AND 
CITIZENS MEASURES ALONGSIDE OUR 
BILL RESHAPE FOR NEW AGE THE 
RESPECTIVE ROLES AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF CITIZEN 
COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENT IN THE 
NEXT TWO DECADES THE SIZE OF THE 
WORLD ECONOMY WILL DOUBLE ONE ONE 
MILLION NEW SKILLED OR PROFESSIONAL 
JOBS WILL BE CREATED 
SO ATTAINING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS 
OF EDUCATION AS WE EXPAND 
OPPORTUNITY IS THE THEME OF THE NEW 
EDUCATION BILL FOR THE COMING 
SESSION FOR SCHOOLS AND LIFE LONG 
LEARNING LEARNING IT IS UNFAIR TO CONSIGN ANY CHILD 
TO POOR SCHOOL OR EVEN ONE THAT 
IS COASTING ALONG WITHOUT AMBITION 
TO DO BETTERMENT HAVING LEGISLATED 
THIS YEAR FOR EDUCATION TO EIGHTEEN 
LOGICAL BE SECOND EDUCATION BILL 
TO SUPPORT OUR OUR PLAN TO ENSURE 
BY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN NO SCHOOL IS 
UNDERPERFORMING THERE WILL BE THE 
FIRST INDEPENDENT QUALIFICATION 
SYSTEM TO GUARANTEE TO PARENTS THE 
HIGHEST STANDARDS THERE WILL BE 
MORE POWER FOR PARENTS IN THE BILL 
TO RECEIVE REGULAR INFORMATION ON 
THEIR CHILDREN'S PROGRESS AND AS WE 
EXPAND ACADEMIES REFORM TO 
STRENGTHEN THE ACCOUNT IACT OF 
SCHOOLS TO PARENTS GIVING THEM A 
BIGGER SAY ON HOW TO RAISE 
STANDARDS AND WHETHER NEW SKILLS 
ARE NEEDED IN THE AREA IT IS 
UNFAIR AND A THREAT TO OUR 
COUNTRY'S FUTURE PROSPERITY THAT 
MANY QUALIFIED YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
DENIED ACCESS TO AN APPRENTICESHIP 
BY DECIDING TO LEGISLATE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH 
FOR THE RIGHT OF EVERY SUITABLY 
QUALIFIED YOUNG PERSON TO ATTAIN AN 
APPRENTICESHIP WE EXPECT THE 
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE STARTING AN 
APPRENTICESHIP TO RISE BY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO 
OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
MR. SPEAKER ALSO EVERY ADULT SHOULD 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO SECOND CHANCE 
IN EDUCATION TO HAVE THEIR CHANCE 
TO MAKE THE MOST OF THA POTENTIAL 
IT IS NOT ONLY THREAT TO 
PROSPERITY AND UNFAIR THAT ADULTS 
IN WORK OR LOOKING FOR WORK ARE 
DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE 
TRAINING THEY NEED TO ADVANCE THEIR 
CAREERS OR EVEN THE TIME NEEDED TO 
DO A COURSE SO MY RIGHT HONOURABLE 
FRIEND THE SECRETARY OF FOR SKILLS 
IS PROPOSING TODAY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME A MAJOR CHANGE IN WORKPLACE 
RIGHTS THAT THAT WILL BENEFIT 
EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS GIVING 
EVERY WORKER THE RIGHT TO REQUEST 
TIME OFF TO TRAIN 
AND WE WILL OFFER EVERY ADULT A 
PERSONAL SKILLS ACCOUNT SO THAT

SO AS PART OF THE NEXT STAGE OF 
WELFARE REFORM EMPHASISING 
OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS RIGHTS THE 
SECRETARY OF FOR WORK WILL 
LEGISLATE DUTY ON THE UNEMPLOYED 
TO HAVE THE SKILLS NEEDS ASSESSED 
AND TO ACQUIRE SKILLS AND WE WILL

RESPECTING THAT PEOPLE NEED 
FLEXIBLE ARRANGEMENTS TO CARE FOR

MR. SPEAKER SINCE LAST YEAR WE HAVE 
SECURED IN THE N. H. S. CLEANER 
HOSPITALS BETTER ACCESS TO G. P.'S

YEARS OF THE N. H. S. TO INTRODUCE A NEW 
N. H. S. REFORM BILL IN THE COMING

RENEWAL OF THE OF THE HEALTH 
SERVICE TO EQUIP IT TO OFFER A 
HIGHER STANDARD OF CARE FOCUS IT 
ON PREVENTION AS WELL AS TREATMENT 
MAKE IT MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO LOCAL 
PEOPLE GIVING PATIENTS REAL POWER 
AND CONTROL OVER THE SERVICE THEY 
RECEIVE RECEIVE SO WE WILL WE WILL ESTABLISH A 
CONSTITUTION FOR THE N. H. S. THAT SETS 
OUT WHAT PATIENTS CAN EXPECT TO GET 
FROM THE HEALTH SERVICE INCLUDING 
ENTITLEMENTS TO MINIMUM STANDARDS 
OF ACCESS QUALITY AND SAFETY AND 
FOR THE FIRST TIME PAYMENTS TO N. H. S. 
HOSPITALS WILL BE ADJUSTED 
ACCORDING TO PATIENT SATISFACTION

RADICAL PROPOSALS ON HEALTH TO PUT 
MORE POWER IN THE HANDS OF PATIENTS 
TO CONTROL THEIR OWN PERSONAL 
BUDGET AND TO HAVE MORE SAY OVER 
THE DECISIONS OF THE LOCAL PRIMARY 
CARE TRUST AND JUST AS WE WILL GIVE 
PARENTS AND PATIENTS MORE CONTROL

IN THEIR HOMES AND IN THEIR 
NEIGHBOURHOODS AND ONE WAY FORWARD 
AS WITH EDUCATION AND HEALTH IS TO 
EMPOWER CITIZENS GIVING THEM MORE

FEEL THEY ARE BEING UNFAIRLY 
UNDERCUT THE SECRETARY FOR

BLIZZARD THESE ARE THE MEASURES 
THERE IS LOT TO BE GOING ON WITH 
HERE HE RATTLED THROUGH IT 
EVEN THE BEST BEST BRAINS AT THE 
B. B. C. COULDN'T KEEP UP WITH IT 
WE ARE GOING TO BRING YOU SOME OF 
WHAT DAVID CAMERON IS SAYING IN A 
MOMENT YOU CAN WATCH THE REST OF 
THE DEBATE OR THE STATEMENTS ON THE 
B. B. C. PARLIAMENT CHANNEL 
WE HAVE HAD TO SAY GOODBYE TO 
MARGARET HODGE BUT CAROLINE FLINT 
JOINS US NOW 
BEFORE WE SPEAK TO HER LET'S HAVE 
A LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THE 
PRIME MINISTER WAS ANNOUNCING HE 
WILL HAVE BANKING AND SAVINGS 
BILL HE ANNOUNCED THIS WAS GOING 
TO BE PART OF AN ECONOMIC PLAN TO 
STEER THE COUNTRY THROUGH FINANCIAL 
TURMOIL HE SAID INTERESTING SCHEME 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BUY UP TO 
TWO HUNDRED MILLION WORTH OF HOUSING AND 
PUT THEM OUT TO RENT 
ANOTHER EDUCATION AND SKILLS BILL 
A CONSTITUTION FOR THE N. H. S. WHICH 
WILL BE GOOD FOR LAWYERS AS WELL AS 
PATIENTS AND THE POLICING AND CRIME 
REDUCTION BILLMENT YET ANOTHER 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE BILL THINK WE 
HAVE ONLY HAD SIXTY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
CAROLINE FLINT 
CAN WE SEE YOUR BRIEFING NOTES FOR 
TODAY 
I THINK YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH TODAY OF MY BRIEFING NOTES FOR MY 
LIFETIME LIFETIME WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY TODAY 
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS 
WHAT MORE LEGISLATION WE WILL NEED 
WE WILL SEE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT DOESN'T INVOLVE 
LEGISLATION IT IS INVOLVING TAKING 
ACTION NOW SOME OF THE 
ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE 
ALLOWING HOUSING CORPORATIONS TO 
BUY SOME PROPERTIES FOR SOCIAL RENT 
IS ONE WAY IN WHICH WE ARE TRYING 
TO SUPPORT THE HOUSING MARKET AT 
THE MOMENT 
WOULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT WOULD 
WORK THERE WILL BE A BUDGET OF OF 
TWO HUNDRED MILLION THE HOUSING 
ASSOCIATIONS USING TAXPAYERS MONEY 
WILL BUY PROPERTIES WHICH ARE NOT 
OCCUPIED AT THE MOMENT 
WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT NEW BUILD PROPERTIES 
AND OF COURSE ANDREW FACTORS SUCH 
AS ARE WE GOING TO GET GOOD VALUE 
FOR MONEY AS LONG AS THE MONEY WE 
ARE USE TO GO BUILD MORE HOUSES 
WHICH STIMULATES THE HOUSING MARKET 
THERE IS SCOPE IN THE RIGHT 
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE RIGHT PLACES 
TO PURCHASE SOME NEW BUILD 
PROPERTIES PROPERTIES YOUR BRIEFING NOTES SAID NEW NEW 
STARTS WERE IN DECLINE 
IN TERMS OF 
WHAT WAS ON MY BRIEF THAT REFLECTED 
WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOUGH DOMAIN 
MANY OF OUR VIEWERS WILL BE 
INTERESTED IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S 
ASSESSMENT THAT HOUSE PRICES THIS 
YEAR WILL FALL BY FIVE PER CENT TO TEN PER CENT WELL WELL WHAT THAT REFLECTED WAS A RANGE OF 
OPINIONS ABOUT WHERE HOUSE PRICES 
ARE GOING 
BUT THAT'S THE 
GOVERNMENT'S BEST GUESS 
NO THAT'S 
IS WHAT I WAS SAYING IN TERMS OF 
WHAT OPINION FORMERS WERE SAYING 
MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE WHAT WE CAN 
DO TO SETTLE THE MARKET WHETHER 
THAT'S THROUGH THE WORK DONE WITH 
LENDERS LENDERS ARE YOU PRECEDING ON THE BEST 
ADVICE THAT YOU CAN GET AND FROM 
WHAT YOU SEE GOING OUT ARE YOU 
PRECEDING ON THE BASIS THAT HOUSE 
PRICES WILL FALL BY FIVE PER CENT TO TEN PER CENT I I DON'T THINK WE CAN PREDICT THAT 
BUT IT IS RIGHT 
BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION 
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE DATA EVERY 
DAY AND THIS IS A RANGE OF 
OPINIONS THAT ARE BEING PUT 
THEY SAID IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT'S 
ESTIMATE 
THEY DID NOT SAY IT WAS ESTIMATE THE GOVERNMENT'S ESTIMATE THIS IS 
WHAT THE INDICATORS ARE TELLING US 
FROM A RANGE OF OPINION 
SORRY TO 
INTERRUPT YOU 
IF YOU ARE TAKING A RANGE OF 
OPINION MANY OUTSIDE OPINIONS 
THINK MANY REPUTABLE ONES THEY 
THINK HOUSE PRICES WILL FALL BY 
MORE THAN TEN PER CENT 
YOU WERE TAKING A BEST GUESS WELL WELL ACTUALLY YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A 
RANGE OF OPINION AND THAT'S WHY WE 
HAVE TO KEEP ON TOP OF WHAT IS 
BEING SAID SOME OF THE FORECASTS 
FOR REPOSSESSIONS WHICH HAVE GONE 
UP ARE NOWHERE WERE THEY WERE IN 
THE EARLY NINETIES SOME FORECASTERS ARE 
SUGGESTING THE ESTIMATES ARE IF 
I COULD FINISH WHAT I'M SAYING 
SOME FORECASTERS ARE SAYING THEIR 
ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE AS HIGH AS 
WHAT THEY WERE SUGGESTING A COUPLE 
OF MONTHS AGO 
BUT ALSO TO ZIM LATE TO STIMULATE 
HOUSE BUILDING AS WELL 
ANDREW DO YOU READ THIS AS I WAS 
LISTENING TO HE RATTLES THROUGH 
THE FIGURES YOU CAN BARELY RUN THEM 
DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO READ THE SMALL 
PRINT WAS OVERALL DESPITE OUR 
PROBLEMS THIS IS A GOVERNMENT THAT 
SHOWS WE ARE STILL ON THE ROAD AND 
FULL OF IDEAS WE HAVE TONNE OF 
THINGS TO DO UPWARDS AND ONWARDS 
CLEARLY THAT WAS THE ATTEMPT AND 
PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT RELAUNCHES AND 
FIGHTBACKS GORDON BROWN WAS KEEN 
TO TALK ABOUT HELP AS WE TALKED 
ABOUT FIRST TIME BUYERS AND WHO 
WANTS TO BE A FIRST TIME WE HEARD 
ABOUT SHARED EQUITY SCHEMES 
HE TALKED ABOUT THE N. H. S. AND THE 
CONSTITUTION IT IS LIKE 
AND GORDON BROWN GOT CRITICISED FOR 
NOT PUTTING THE DETAIL OUT IN HIS 
BUDGETS WHEN HE STOOD UP 
THE REAL SUBSTANCE WILL BE IN THE 
BRIEFING DOCUMENTS THAT YOU HAVE 
GOT THERE 
HOW DO YOU READ IT KEN CLARKE HE HE GABLE IT OUT HE GABLED IT OUT 
I WOULD LIKE HIM TO HAVE SAID WE 
NEED LESS LEGISLATION 
EVERY EVERY SUBJECT DOESN'T NEED 
LEGISLATION IT SHOULD BE DRAFTED 
MORE CAREFULLY AND AND NOT BECAUSE 
THERE IS A BY ELECTION COMING THAT 
SHOULD YOU ANNOUNCE THINGS 
THE HEALTH SERVICE THE EDUCATION 
SERVICE AND THE POLICE SERVICE DON 
WANT MORE LEGISLATION AND MORE 
INSTITUTIONAL REFORM

BUYER DON'T BUY FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS IT 
WILL BE CHEAPER THE HOUSE BUILDING 
INDUSTRY IS IN A MESS THIS 
PROPOSAL COMES FROM CAROLINE'S 
DEPARTMENT THAT THE HOUSING 
ASSOCIATION SHOULD BUY SOME OF THE 
UNSOLD HOUSES THEY HAVE TO DO THAT
