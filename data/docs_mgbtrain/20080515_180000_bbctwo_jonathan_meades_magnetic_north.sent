THE SOUTH WE ALL WANT TO BE THERE 
IT'S AN IDEAL IT DRAWS US TO IT IT'S A MYTHICAL PLACE 
SEA SEX AND SUN 
TO BRITONS TODAY THE SOUTH IS EXUBERANT VINES GUILTLESS HEDONISM 
EXCITABLE OLIVES THE IMMEMORIAL RUINS OF IMMEMORIAL CIVILISATIONS 
PRIMARY COLOURED EMOTIONS 
IT'S A PROMISED LAND AND A ROLE SUPERMODEL 
OUR WINE IS FROM THE SOUTH WE EAT THE SOUTH'S FOOD 
WE VERTICALLY TAN TO LOOK SOUTHERN ORANGES DO COME FROM THE SOUTH 
OUR ARCHITECTS ARE GOING TO REMAKE RUNDOWN YORKSHIRE TOWNS AS TUSCAN HILL VILLAGES 
BECAUSE BRITAIN AND ITALY SHARE A COMMON CULTURE AND A COMMON CLIMATE 
THE SOUTH CAUSES THE NORTH TO SUFFER A COLLECTIVE DELUSION ABOUT ITSELF 
WE DENY OUR NORTHERNNESS 
WE DENY IT TO SUCH AN EXTENT 
THAT WE ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THOSE COUNTRIES THAT SHARE OUR CLIMATE 
THEY MIGHT REMIND US OF OURSELVES 
THEY TOO ARE ENGAGED IN A PERPETUAL BATTLE DENYING THEIR NORTHERNNESS 
TO BE NORTHERN IS TO BE FOREVER ILL AT EASE WITH ONESELF 
WHY EVER WOULD ANYONE GO NORTH 
OUT OF CURIOSITY 
EXOTICISM MAY NOT DEPEND EXCLUSIVELY ON OUZO AND OLIVES 
AND IF THE NORTH LIKE THE SOUTH IS MORE THAN A CARDINAL POINT OF THE COMPASS WHERE IS IT 
WHERE DOES IT START 
QUE J. E. CROYAIS VOIR LE CIEL BLEU 
J'APPRENAIS MES LECONS LA JOUE CONTRE SON BRAS 
J. E. CROIS QU'IL ETAIT FIER DE MOI 
IL ETAIT GENEREUX COMME CEUX DU PAYS 
ET J. E. LUI DOIS CE QUE J. E. SUIS 
AU NORD C'ETAIENT LES CORONS

LE CIEL C'ETAIT L'HORIZON

LE CIEL C'ETAIT L'HORIZON 
LES HOMME LES MINEURS DU FOND 
THE LATE PIERRE BACHELET'S SENTIMENTAL ANTHEM 
TELLS US THAT SLAGHEAPS ARE TO THE NORTH WHAT SYBARITISM IS TO THE SOUTH 
IT ALSO TELLS US THAT THIS IS WHERE THE NORTH BEGINS 
HERE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FRANCE CALLED BALDLY NORD 
HIT THE NORTH BY THE FALL 
HIT THE NORTH 
AAAAAAH HIT THE NORTH 
HIT THE NORTH MY CAT SAYS 
THE NORTH STARTS HERE IN FLANDERS IN THE TAPESTRY TOWN OF ARRAS 
WHICH GAVE ITS NAME TO THE KIND OF SCREEN POLONIUS WAS BEHIND WHEN HE SUFFERED HIS UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT 
I FIRST CAME HERE THE FIRST TIME I TRAVELLED TO ITALY 
NOTHING I SUBSEQUENTLY SAW IN PIENZA OR SAN GIMIGNIANO OR SIENA 
IMPRESSED ME THE WAY THAT THESE GREAT SQUARES DID 
THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME 
THE MAN WHO PREFERRED THE FLEMISH TO THE FLORENTINE 
WHO STILL PREFERS IT 
IN FIFTEEN HUNDRED ARRAS HAD A POPULATION OF LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND 
YET IT BUILT THESE GREAT URBAN SQUARES AND A SPLENDID TOWN HALL 
WHEN EXCAVATIONS ARE MADE IN FLANDERS FOR ROADS AND RAILWAYS 
THE BONES OF MEN SLAUGHTERED IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
CONSTITUTE THE FIRST STRATUM THAT DIGGERS ENCOUNTER 
FURTHER DOWN ARE MULTITUDINOUS HERRING SKELETONS 
THE PEOPLE OF ARRAS ATE BETWEEN TWO AND THREE MILLION HERRINGS PER YEAR 
THAT'S TWO TO THREE HUNDRED FOR EVERY PERSON 
THEY WERE FAITHFUL TO THE STAPLE BUT THEN THEY HAD NO CHOICE 
THAT'S WHAT A STAPLE MEANS 
BUT WHAT A STAPLE 
THIS SUPPOSEDLY HUMBLE FISH WHICH ACTUALLY INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO LOBSTER OR SOLE 
HAS INCITED GREAT INGENUITY IN HUMANS 
OUR FORBEARS HAVE SMOKED IT IN COUNTLESS WAYS 
SWEET CURED IT SOUR CURED IT 
SOUSED IT IN GIN SOUSED IT VINEGAR 
EATEN IT RAW BURIED IT FERMENTED IT 
HERRING IS STILL A STAPLE EATEN NORTH OF HERE FOR MORE THAN A THOUSAND MILES 
FROM FLANDERS TO THE FURTHEST SHORES OF THE BALTIC 
THERE EXISTS A UNIFORMITY AS DISTINCTIVE 
AS THAT OF THE MEDITERRANEAN 
A UNIFORMITY WHICH IS MUCH MORE THAN GASTRONOMIC 
A UNIFORMITY FRACTURED BY NEIGHBOURLY MURDEROUSNESS DOWN THE CENTURIES 
BUT WHICH REMAINS MANIFEST IN ARCHITECTURE IN ART IN FOOD AND DRINK 
IN SCHNAPPS AND BEER 
AH 
THE NORTH IS AS MUCH AN IDEAL AS THE SOUTH 
IT'S THE UNPROMISED LAND OF DARKNESS 
OF THE GOTHIC IN ALL ITS FORMS 
OF THRILLING GRIMNESS EXHILARATING HARSHNESS INKY CANALS FOG GLISTENING COBBLES 
OF BUILDINGS THAT RESPOND TO FLATLANDS AND VAST SKIES WITH SPIRES 
FANTASTICAL ROOFLINES WILD GABLES POINTED ARCHES 
AND SLAGHEAPS WHICH MAN MADE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF MOUNTAINS 
NORTHERN ART HAS DOWN THE CENTURIES SHUNNED BROAD BRUSH MARKS IN FAVOUR OF MINUTE DETAIL 
IT REVELS IN THE GROTESQUE AND THE DISCOMFITING 
IT IS BORN OUT OF DISGUST AT OUR BODIES DESPAIR AT OUR MORES 
THE NORTHERN SPIRIT IS ONE OF BALEFUL NEUROSIS GRINNING CYNICISM AND GLEEFUL MISANTHROPY 
IT IS EXCITED BY BLEAK DEFORMITIES 
IT IS CHARACTERISED BY EXISTENTIAL GLOOM 
IT RELISHES HORRIBLE LAUGHTER FEAR MOCKERY JOYLESS PERVERSITY 
RATHER THAN THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS 
IT IS NOT IMMUNE TO BEAUTY BUT ITS IDEA OF BEAUTY IS FAR FROM CLASSICAL 
IT IS JAGGED 
AS I SAY THE NORTH IS SELDOM AT EASE WITH ITSELF 
SOUTHERN EUROPEANS HOLD THEIR LIQUOR AND SHUN MASS DRUNKENNESS 
THAT ANYWAY IS THE MYTH 
THERE IS A CORRESPONDING MYTH ABOUT NORTHERN EUROPEANS 
THEY ESCAPE FROM THEMSELVES BY DRINKING FOR OBLIVION AND THEN BY SUICIDE 
THAT IS IF CIRRHOSIS HASN'T GOT THEM FIRST 
NEITHER PROPOSITION IS STRICTLY ACCURATE 
BUT WE TEND TO BELIEVE THE LATTER BECAUSE WE KNOW SO LITTLE OF THE NORTH 
BEER IS TO THE NORTH WHAT WOODS ARE TO BEARS 
AN ESSENTIAL NECESSITY 
WINE'S PRIMACY IS VANQUISHED 
THE FLATLANDS ARE A BORDERLAND BECAUSE THEY OCCUPY LATITUDES 
WHERE VINES CEASE TO BE PRODUCTIVE THE WEATHER'S NOT UP TO IT 
WHO DRANK MY BEER WHILE I WAS IN THE REAR 
TELL ME TELL ME WHO DRANK MY BEER WHILE I WAS IN THE REAR 
THE BEERS BREWED IN NORTHERN FRANCE AND BELGIUM GIVE THE LIE TO THE IDEA 
THAT DRINK IS SIMPLY AN AGENT OF OBLIVION 
THOUGH PRESUMABLY DROPSICAL MEDIAEVAL MONKS SUBJECT TO A VOW OF SILENCE 
DID OFTEN DRINK AS MUCH AS TWELVE PINTS A DAY 
BEER IS ALSO DELICIOUS AND VARIED 
SAFFRON BEER LIQUORICE BEER HONEY BEER APPLE BEER CHESTNUT BEER 
BEER THAT TASTES LIKE VIROL 
BEER'S COMPARATIVELY LOWLY STATUS MAY BE DUE TO ITS BEING PREDOMINANTLY A DRINK OF THE NORTH 
WHICH DOES NOT CARRY THE CLICHED CONNOTATIONS OF SUN AND SYBARITISM ATTACHED TO WINE 
THERE IS ANOTHER DRINK THE NORTH CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT 
DISTILLED GRAIN GOES UNDER MANY NAMES MOTHER'S RUIN VERA LYNN 
IN FRENCH FLANDERS IT'S KNOWN AS HOULLE AFTER WHAT WAS A SINGLE INDUSTRY VILLAGE 
TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE SIX DISTILLERIES 
CORENWYN AND PEKET ARE OTHER NAMES 
THE MOST COMMON IS GENIEVRE AFTER THE FRENCH FOR JUNIPER 
WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR FLAVOURING AGENT 
STAY AWAY FROM ME COS I'M IN MY SCENE 
THAT WORD IS NOT THAT FAR FROM GENEVER WHICH IS USED IN HALF OF BELGIUM AND IN ALL OF HOLLAND 
GENEVER WAS ABBREVIATED IN ENGLISH TO GIN 
IN LONDON GIN WAS ALSO KNOWN AS HOLLANDS 
SOMEBODY GIVE ME MY GIN 
IT HAD BEEN INTRODUCED WITH THE MONARCHY'S RESTORATION IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY 
CHARLES THE SECOND HAD SPENT MUCH OF HIS EXILE IN HOLLAND 
IT WASN'T JUST GIN THAT BRITAIN OWED TO THE LOW COUNTRIES 
THERE WAS DUTCH COURAGE THERE WAS WILLIAM OF ORANGE 
THERE WAS ALSO THE QUIET HARMONIOUS IMMEDIATELY POST GOTHIC ARCHITECTURAL STYLE 
THAT BRITAIN COPIED FROM SUCH TOWNS AS MIDDELBURG 
SOMEBODY GIVE ME MY GIN 
GIN WAS TO THAT ERA 
WHAT CRACK AND SMACK ARE TO OUR OWN 
THE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT IT WAS A COVETED SOURCE OF REVENUE 
IT WAS SAID OF THE UNITED PROVINCES' INHABITANTS THAT 
THEY HATE THEIR STATES YET LOVE THEIR LIQUOR AND PAY EXCISE 
RATHER LIKE BRITAIN TODAY 
ANY SHREWD EXCHEQUER KNOWS THAT THE APPETITE FOR LIQUOR 
WILL ALWAYS OVERCOME PRUDENCE 
SOMEBODY GIVE MY GIN 
FRUITS SUCH AS GRAPES FERMENT NATURALLY CEREALS DON'T 
SO MALTING WAS ARRIVED AT AS THE MEANS TO STIMULATE FERMENTATION IN CEREALS 
BECAUSE INTOXICATION IS AN ELEMENTAL HUMAN NEED 
A NEED THAT INCREASES AS THE CLIMATE BECOMES HOSTILE TOWARDS CULTIVATION 
WHILST AT THE SAME TIME DEMANDING TO BE COUNTERED BY DREAMS BY WALLS OF BLANKNESS 
THUS WHERE THE NEED IS GREATEST THERE ARE THE FEWEST MEANS OF SATISFYING IT 
WHERE THE LIVING ISN'T EASY 
HIGHER LEVELS OF RESOURCEFULNESS ARE REQUIRED TO CREATE THE CHEMICAL ILLUSION OF EASE 
WHICH IS A VITAL COMPENSATION 
INGENUITY EXISTS OR SHOULD EXIST 
IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO A LANDSCAPE'S HOSTILITY AND A CLIMATE'S SEVERITY 
ZEELAND IS WELL NAMED SEA LAND NEITHER LAND NOR SEA 
LAND WHICH WAS ONCE SEA 
LAND WHICH IS FOREVER THREATENED BY THE SEA AND MAY BECOME SEA AGAIN 
THE RECLAMATION OF LAND FROM SEA AND BEYOND THAT THE CREATION OF LAND WHERE THERE WAS NONE 
ARE TESTIMONIES TO DUTCH INGENUITY 
THIS IS A COUNTRY WHOSE MOST BASIC FABRIC IS MAN MADE 
THIS IS NOT THE NATURAL WORLD 
IT IS THE UNNATURAL WORLD 
NATURE HAS BEEN DEFEATED AND MAN HAS FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST TRIUMPHED 
AND BECAUSE HE HAS TRIUMPHED HE FEELS AT LIBERTY TO TAKE DIABOLICAL LIBERTIES 
THE GREAT PAINTERS OF THE NORTHERN TRADITION 
VAN DER WEYDEN AND VAN EYCK BOSCH AND BOUTS 
NEVER ALLOW THEIR SUBJECTS WHICH ARE SOMETIMES RELIGIOUS 
TO OCCLUDE THEIR WORLDLINESS 
THIS TRADITION CONTINUES TODAY 
THE PIETISM OF THEIR SUBJECT MATTER 
IS UNDERMINED BY HIGH ARTIFICE 
THE AESTHETIC AUSTERITIES AND THE HUMILITY OF THE SOUTH 
ARE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN 
SACRED ART IN THE NORTH DOES NOT DISSEMBLE TECHNIQUE FLAIR BRIO 
THE PAINTER IS OMNIPRESENT NEVER LETTING YOU FORGET THAT ALL THIS IS ACHIEVED THROUGH HUMAN SKILL 
ACCORDING TO BOSCH HEAVEN IS A DOGGER'S PARADISE 
A CELESTIAL CAR PARK RENDEZVOUS 
AND SO TOO IS HELL 
THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT PIGS ARE DRESSED AS NUNS 
THE ARTIST IS MORE INTERESTED IN INVENTING THAN IN PREACHING 
BUT WHAT IF BOSCH WAS WRONG 
WHAT IF ALL THIS CORRUPTING FLESH IS JUST SO MUCH WISHFUL THINKING 
AND BOTH HEAVEN AND HELL ARE CAR PARKS WHERE NO ONE TURNS UP WHERE YOU ARE ALONE FOREVER 
SEAGULLS CALL IN DISTANCE 
JUST AS THE NORTH'S NATIVE DRINKS ARE BEER AND DISTILLED GRAIN 
SO IS ITS TRUE ARCHITECTURE THE GOTHIC 
THE GOTHIC IS INDIGENOUS 
IT STARTS WHERE VINES STOP 
WHICH MAY OF COURSE BE COMPLETELY BY CHANCE 
THE CATHEDRALS OF SAINT DENIS 
LAON SAINT QUENTIN SOISSONS REIMS COUTANCES AND THIS ONE AT AMIENS 
ARE NOT MERELY REMARKABLE STRUCTURES 
THEY PROVIDED THE TEMPLATE FOR COUNTLESS OTHERS 
THEY CREATED THE ARCHITECTURAL IDIOM THAT IN ITS VARIOUS GUISES 
WOULD DOMINATE NORTHERN EUROPE FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS FROM THE TWELVE HUNDREDS TO THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS 
THE GOTHIC SPREAD NORTH LIKE AN ARCHITECTONIC PANDEMIC 
THE NORTH AND GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE WOULD BECOME INDISSOLUBLY BOUND TO EACH OTHER 
IN THE NORTH THE GOTHIC WAS THE NORM 
INDEED THE GOTHIC OUTLIVED THE GOTHIC AGE 
IT NEVER WENT AWAY 
IT NEVER WILL 
NORTHERN RELIGIOUS ARCHITECTURE IS OF COURSE MADE TO THE GLORY OF GOD 
IT CREATES SPACES WHERE MANKIND CAN ABASE ITSELF BEFORE AN IMPORTED SPIRITUAL IDEA 
YET THIS SCARED ARCHITECTURE LIKE CONTEMPORARY PAINTING 
IS JUST AS CONCERNED WITH A MARKEDLY EARTHBOUND SHOWING OFF 
OF COURSE SUMPTUOUS CARVING AND ABUNDANT SCULPTURE SIGNIFY CIVIC MIGHT A TOWN'S PRIDE AND WEALTH 
BUT THEY ALSO BOAST ABOUT THE CRAFTSMAN'S PROWESS 
THERE IS A PARADOX HERE 
THE HUMAN MAKER'S OMNIPRESENCE IS APPARENT IN GOTHIC 
IN A WAY THAT IT IS NOT IN CLASSICAL STRUCTURES 
BUT IT IS CLASSICAL STRUCTURES WHICH ARE NOTIONALLY 
FOUNDED IN PROPORTIONS DERIVED FROM THE HUMAN BODY 
GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE IS AKIN TO SHAKESPEARE'S ART 
SUBLIME AND VULGAR MONSTROUS AND TENDER 
IT STEALS FROM EVERYWHERE 
THE GOTHIC IS NOT UNDERPINNED BY AN INTELLECTUAL FORMULA 
LEAST OF ALL BY AN ABSTRACTION THAT PRECEDES THE WORK A GENERIC RULEBOOK 
MAN DOES NOT BASE THE GOTHIC UPON HIS MEASURABLE BODY 
BUT UPON WHAT OCCURS IN HIS IMMEASURABLE MIND AND IMAGINATION 
THE GOTHIC WAS FLUID 
IT ENCOURAGED INVENTION 
TYRANTS AND AUTOCRATS HAVE SELDOM ESPOUSED IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REPRESENT ORDER 
IT REPRESENTS RATHER INDIVIDUALITY AND ORIGINALITY 
GOTHIC BUILDINGS EVIDENTLY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR PRECURSORS 
BUT THEY DON'T COPY THEM 
GOTHIC WAS IN ITS WAY PROGRESSIVE ALWAYS SEEKING TO IMPROVE 
OR AT LEAST TO BE DIFFERENT 
THIS CONSENSUS OVER LONG CENTURIES AND GREAT DISTANCES 
WAS MERELY ARCHITECTURAL NOTHING MORE 
ARCHITECTURE CAN BE A BOND 
BUT NOT HERE 
HERE IT WAS A MASK WHICH DISGUISED SCHISMS 
IT PAPERED OVER THE NORTHERN POST REFORMATION APPETITE 
FOR EVER DIVIDING COMMUNIONS 
COMMUNIONS WHOSE DOGMATIC DIFFERENCES SEEM MERE HAIR SPLITTING TO THE OUTSIDER 
SUCH FACTIONALISM WAS MOCKED IN THE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTIES BY ANDREW MARVELL 
SURE WHEN RELIGION DID ITSELF EMBARK 
AND FROM THE EAST WOULD WESTWARD STEER ITS ARK 
IT STRUCK AND SPLITTING ON THIS UNKNOWN GROUND 
EACH ONE THENCE PILLAG'D THE FIRST PIECE HE FOUND 
HENCE AMSTERDAM TURK CHRISTIAN PAGAN JEW 
STAPLE OF SECTS AND MINT OF SCHISM GREW 
THAT BANK OF CONSCIENCE WHERE NOT ONE SO STRANGE 
OPINION BUT FINDS CREDIT AND EXCHANGE 
EDAM 
THERE IS A DUTCH SAYING THAT WHEN THREE PEOPLE MEET THEY FORM A SECT 
AND WHEN A FOURTH JOINS THE SECT SPLITS IN TWO OVER DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCES 
THIS IS THE ONE AND TRUE CHEESE 
THESE ARE APOSTATE CHEESES 
BECAUSE THEY ARE FLAVOURED WITH CARAWAY AND WITH CLOVES 
AND THIS IS THE CHEESE OF HERETICS BECAUSE IT IS FLAVOURED WITH PEPPER 
MAY THEY SNEEZE IN HELL 
NUMEROUS MUTUALLY TOLERANT CONFESSIONS CO EXISTED IN THE EARLY SIXTEEN HUNDREDS 
THIS CO EXISTENCE WAS ENCOURAGED BY THOSE WHOSE ENDURING GOD WAS MONEY 
FOR THEY STOOD TO GAIN FROM IT 
A MERCHANT GUILD OR FELLOWSHIP WHOSE MEMBERS ARE OF DIFFERENT FAITHS 
AND CULTURES IS LESS RESTRICTED IN WHOM IT CAN DO BUSINESS WITH 
THAN ONE WHICH IS UNIFORMLY COMPOSED 
SECTARIANISM DIMINISHES RELIGION'S TEMPORAL POWER 
COUNTLESS DIVERGING SECTS CANNOT EXERCISE THE SORT OF CONTROL THAT A SINGLE CHURCH CAN 
RELIGION THEN CEASES TO DOMINATE THE EVERYDAY 
IT BECOMES WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A FAITH STYLE CHOICE AN ADD ON 
THE NORTH IS WHERE RELIGION BEGAN TO GROW UP BEGAN TO SELF SECULARISE 
THE FIRST GRAPHIC STEP IN THAT PROCESS WAS ICONOCLASM 
STRIPPING CHURCHES OF IDOLATROUS IMAGES WHICH ARE NO MORE THAN JUJUS 
THE RESULTANT POST REFORMATION CHURCH INTERIORS 
BEREFT OF AMULETS WERE THE INVARIABLE SUBJECT OF THE PAINTINGS 
MADE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS 
BY THE HAARLEM MASTER PIETER SAENREDAM 
THE EXTENT OF THEIR SECULARISATION IS MADE OBVIOUS 
CHURCHES HAD BECOME PUBLIC PARKS WITH A ROOF 
YOU MIGHT AMBLE CONVERSE HANG OUT LIE AROUND VISIT AS A TOURIST 
OR MAKE PAINTINGS OF THEM 
SAENREDAM'S PAINTINGS ARE SPELLBINDING IN THEIR STILLNESS 
LACK OF INCIDENT LACK OF ALL BUT A FEW ISOLATED INDIVIDUALS 
WHO ARE ENGAGED IN ANYTHING BUT WORSHIP 
ALL SAENREDAM TOOK FROM VAN DER WEYDEN LET ALONE BOSCH 
WAS AN OBSESSION WITH METICULOUS DETAIL 
OTHERWISE HE IS COLD DISPASSIONATE OBJECTIVE 
HE INVENTED AN ART OF SELF PROCLAIMING UNDERSTATEMENT 
IT APPEARS WORRYINGLY BLAND STUBBORNLY MUTE 
NOTHING HAPPENS IN A MOST EMPHATIC WAY 
YET THE VERY ABSENCES PROVOKE FOREBODING AND DISCOMFITURE 
THEY PERSUADE THE SPECTATOR TO WONDER WHAT IS NOT BEING SHOWN 
THEY IMPLY AN UNSPOKEN MYSTERY 
A METAPHYSICAL MYSTERY NOT A TRANSCENDENTAL MYSTERY 
HE TALKS QUIETLY AND SUBTLY 
ABOUT THE SHEER MARVELLOUSNESS OF HUMAN LIFE HUMAN SENSIBILITY HUMAN INGENUITY 
SAENREDAM'S ACHIEVEMENT WAS PECULIAR AND IT WAS FOR CENTURIES UNACKNOWLEDGED 
IT WAS NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH CENTURY TILL THE ADVENT OF THE MACHINE AGE 
THAT HIS AUSTERITY AND BLANKNESS RANG A BELL 
HIS DETACHEDNESS BECAME A NORTHERN NORM 
SO WIDELY EMULATED THAT THERE IS EFFECTIVELY A CONTINUOUS SCHOOL OF SAENREDAM 
SELF CONSCIOUSLY GLACIAL NON COMMITTAL 
AND AS PREGNANT WITH POSSIBILITY AS THOSE CHURCHES 
WHERE SOMETHING MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN 
SOMETHING TERRIBLE 
HIS BLEAKLY HUMANISTIC EXAMPLE IS DISCERNIBLE IN THE WORK 
OF A SCHOOL OF PAINTERS WHO ARE HARDLY KNOWN IN BRITAIN 
BECAUSE BRITAIN LOOKED SOUTH 
GAVE SLAVERING FORELOCK TO THE BROAD BRUSHMARKS OF MEDITERRANEAN SATYRS 
SO NORTHERN PAINTERS SUCH AS THE DUTCHMAN CAREL WILLINK 
AND THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC ARTISTS RICHARD OELZE CHRISTIAN SCHAD 
FRANZ RADZIWILL ARE ABSURDLY OVERLOOKED 
AND SO TOO ARE THEIR CURRENT PEERS NO MATTER HOW BRILLIANT THEY MAY BE 
MY NAME IS ANNEMARIE BUSSCHERS PAINTER 
I LIVE AND WORK IN GRONINGEN 
WHO IS IT 
MY HUSBAND TONNIS HOW MANY PORTRAITS HAVE YOU MADE OF HIM 
UM THREE 
THERE'S NO GREATER DOCK SCAPE 
IN NORTHERN EUROPE THAN HAMBURG'S 
INTERNATIONAL TRADE REQUIRED A COMMON LANGUAGE 
WHEN THE GLOBE WAS NOT YET A GLOBE WHEN YOU COULD STILL FALL OFF THE EDGE 
THE LINGUA FRANCA SPOKEN FROM FLANDERS AS FAR AS THE EASTERNMOST BALTIC 
WAS PLATTDEUTSCH 
THE GERMAN OF THE COASTAL FLATLANDS OF THE STILL FLAT WORLD 
THIS PIDGIN OF CONVENIENCE WAS PICKED UP IN TAVERNS AND PRISONS AND BROTHELS 
THERE IS NO GREATER BROTHEL IN NORTHERN EUROPE THAN HAMBURG 
THE NORTHERN WAY OF SELLING SEX IS TO DO IT WITH A SORT OF CANDOUR 
THE SEX SHOPS AND MASSAGE PARLOURS THE STRIP CLUBS AND HOSTESS BARS 
MIGHT BE SELLING COMPUTERS OR FAN BELTS THEY ARE FAR FROM FURTIVE 
THIS BUILDING BEHIND ME HOUSES THE MONUMENT TO THE UNKNOWN PIMP 
SOCIETIES WHICH TOLERATE AND EVEN HONOUR PROSTITUTION 
DO NOT PROSECUTE GENOCIDAL PROGRAMMES 
IT'S A CHARACTERISTIC OF SOCIETIES WHICH DO PROSECUTE SUCH PROGRAMMES 
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A PRUDISH HORROR OF SEXUAL SLEAZE 
ETHNIC CLEANSERS ARE MORAL CLEANSERS 
IT WAS NOT THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC WHICH EXTERMINATED MILLIONS OF INNOCENTS 
BUT THE THIRD REICH WHICH ALSO DECLARED THE GREAT WEIMAR PAINTERS TO BE DECADENT 
HAMBURG IS TOLERANT OF THE SEX INDUSTRY 
NOT MERELY HOWEVER BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPRESS 
THE SEX INDUSTRY IS INDUSTRY TRADE COMMERCE 
I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT IT HAS THE ULTRA GOLD SEAL OF APPROVAL 
FROM THE ONLY GOD WHO COUNTS ROUND HERE MAMMON 
LOOK AT THE NUMBERPLATE ON THIS CAR 
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT A CAR IT'S A BOAST A BOAST ABOUT WEALTH 
H. H. STANDS FOR HANSESTADT HAMBURG 
HAMBURG WAS A MEMBER OF THE HANSE THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE CENTURIES BEFORE GERMANY EXISTED 
AND HAMBURG'S IDENTITY ITS SENSE OF ITSELF 
IS MUCH MORE TIED TO THAT MERCANTILE ALLIANCE GOD'S FIRST ATTEMPT AT THE E. U. 
THAN IT IS TO GERMANY 
ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT GERMANY THIS IS HANSELAND 
TIME FOR A HERRING TIME FOR A SCHNAPPS 
NEXT TIME 
WHAT THE HANSE TOOK FROM NORTHERN FRANCE 
AND WHAT IT GAVE TO LIVERPOOL 
WE'LL ASK WHY ISN'T VENICE THE STRALSUND OF THE SOUTH 
AND MANFRED JURGENS UNVEILS ANOTHER LOW LIFE PORTRAIT 
TSCHUSS
