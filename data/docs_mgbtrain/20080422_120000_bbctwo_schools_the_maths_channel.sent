THE CHANNEL YOU CAN COUNT ON 
THIS PROGRAMME IS ABOUT DESCRIBING POSITION AND DIRECTION 
BEING ABLE TO DESCRIBE CLEARLY WHERE SOMETHING IS 
OR HOW TO GET SOMEWHERE CAN BE VERY USEFUL 
THERE ARE SOME VERY USEFUL WORDS 
THAT CAN HELP US DESCRIBE POSITIONS AND DIRECTIONS 
FOR INSTANCE WE CAN USE WORDS TO DESCRIBE 
THE POSITION OF THINGS ON DISPLAY IN A SHOP WINDOW 
SO WHAT'S IN FRONT OF THE PINK MONKEY 
A RED CAR 
AND WHAT'S ABOVE THE GLOBE 
A GRANNY DOLL 
AND WHAT'S THAT HIDING INSIDE THE TOY DRUM 
A YELLOW SCOOTER 
AND THE POSITION OF EVERYTHING IS 
THE SHOP WINDOW

ACROBATS AND DANCERS CAN GET THEMSELVES INTO TRICKY POSITIONS 
AND CAN MOVE IN MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
MARCO IN BLUE IS UNDER RIANNE IN PINK 
AND RIANNE IS ABOVE MARCO 
THESE TWO ACROBATS ARE MOVING 
WHERE ARE THE ACROBATS IN BLUE STANDING 
THE ACROBATS IN BLUE ARE 
THEY HAVE TO BE STRONG TO SUPPORT ALL THE ACROBATS ABOVE THEM 
AND WHERE ARE THE ACROBATS IN THE PINK T. SHIRTS 
THE ACROBATS IN PINK ARE 
THEY'RE BALANCING ON TOP OF THE ACROBATS AT THE BOTTOM 
AND WHERE'S THE ACROBAT IN THE BROWN T. SHIRT 
WELL HE'S THE ACROBAT BALANCING ON TOP OF EVERYONE ELSE 
AND THE TRAPEZE ARTIST IS IN THE HIGHEST POSITION OF ALL 
FOR MOST PEOPLE FINDING THEIR WAY TO THE LOCAL SHOP IS EASY 
AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO THINK IN WHICH DIRECTION TO WALK 
OR THE EXACT POSITION OF THE SHOP 
BUT IF YOU'RE BLIND OR CAN'T SEE VERY WELL LIKE ANITA HERE 
HAVING A GOOD SENSE OF DIRECTION CAN BE VERY USEFUL INDEED 
AFTER TURNING LEFT FROM MY WORKPLACE 
I WALK STRAIGHT ON DOWN THE STREET 
I HAVE A VERY CLEAR PICTURE IN MY MIND 
OF THE ROUTE THAT I TAKE TO THE SHOPS 
I HAVE A LONG CANE WHICH I HOLD OUT IN FRONT OF ME ALL THE TIME 
SO I DON'T BUMP INTO THINGS AND TRIP OVER THEM 
THE POSITION OF THE CANE IS VERY IMPORTANT 
BESIDES HOLDING THE CANE OUT IN FRONT OF ME 
I MOVE THE CANE FROM SIDE TO SIDE 
TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOTHING SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE 
TO MY RIGHT OR TO MY LEFT 
WHEN I APPROACH A SIDE STREET 
I TURN 
IT'S SAFER IF THERE'S A ZEBRA CROSSING I CAN USE 
AFTER CROSSING THE STREET I USE THE CANE 
TO TELL ME IF THE KERB IS HIGHER THAN THE ROAD 
THERE'S ONE MORE CROSSING BEFORE I REACH THE SHOPS 
WHERE I HAVE TO TURN RIGHT 
AND THEN LEFT 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROSSING 
WHEN I REACH THE SHOPPING PRECINCT 
I TURN LEFT AND WALK TOWARDS 
THE SHOP ON THE CORNER 
I KNOW WHEN I'M IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
BECAUSE I CAN HEAR THE ECHO FROM THE CANOPY ABOVE MY HEAD 
IF I VISIT SOMEWHERE NEW TO ME 
SOMETIMES I HAVE TO ASK SOMEBODY THE WAY 
THE FIRST TURNING ON YOUR LEFT TAKES YOU TO THE SUSHI RESTAURANT 
WHICH IS NEXT TO THE BREAD SHOP 
IT'S WONDERFUL IF I FIND SOMEBODY 
WHO GIVES ME FAIRLY CLEAR DIRECTIONS'

THESE DANCERS ARE STANDING IN A CIRCLE 
THEY'RE MOVING 
AND ROUND AND ROUND 
AND THIS DANCER IS ALSO MOVING HER RIBBON AROUND IN A CIRCLE 
BUT SHE CAN MOVE THE RIBBON AROUND IN TWO DIRECTIONS 
SO HOW DO WE DESCRIBE OR TELL SOMEONE 
WHICH WAY TO TURN IN A CIRCLE 
WELL IF THEY'RE GOING THE SAME WAY ROUND AS THE HANDS OF A CLOCK 
THAT DIRECTION IS CALLED CLOCKWISE DOWN ON THE RIGHT 
BUT IF THEY'RE GOING THE WAY THE CLOCK DOESN'T USUALLY GO 
THAT'S CALLED ANTI CLOCKWISE THAT'S DOWN ON THE LEFT 
BUT OF COURSE CLOCKS ALWAYS TURN CLOCKWISE 
MOVING DOWN ON THE RIGHT 
CLOCKWISE 
CLOCKWISE 
MOVING DOWN ON THE LEFT 
POSITION IS WHERE SOMETHING'S AT 
AND THE MOUSE IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE CAT 
MIAOW 
AND NOW THAT HE'S HEARD HER 
HE WANTS TO BE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE CAT ON THE MAT 
IF HE STAYS THERE BESIDE HER 
HE'LL END UP INSIDE HER 
THE MOUSE IN THE CAT ON THE MAT 
HIS EMERGENCY MISSION TODAY 
IS TO KEEP HIS POSITION O. K. 
HE MUST MAKE HIS SELECTION 
OF DIFFERENT DIRECTION 
KEEP MOVING IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS 
TO THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT 
FROM SUN UP UNTIL SUN DOWN 
FROM PILLAR TO POST SOMETIMES FAR SOMETIMES CLOSE 
THAT CAT CHASED THAT MOUSE ROUND THE TOWN 
EVERY TWIST EVERY TURN 
PUT A GAP IN BETWEEN MOUSE AND CAT 
FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS INWARDS AND OUTWARDS 
HE KEPT THAT OLD CAT IN A FLAP 
WHEN THE CAT'S IN THE MIDDLE BE AT THE EDGE 
IF THE CAT'S AT ONE CORNER GO OPPOSITE INSTEAD 
TO AVOID BEING CAPTURED YOU MUST KEEP YOUSELF WELL AHEAD 
OVER WALLS ALONG ROOFS UNDER BRIDGES THROUGH ROOMS 
THE MOUSE WENT BEFORE THE CAT AFTER 
WHEN THE CAT'S ON THE HUNT YOU MUST STAY IN FRONT 
AND TRY TO GET FURTHER APART ER 
WHEN THE CAT'S IN PURSUIT KEEP CHANGING YOUR ROUTE 
OR THINGS WILL END UP IN DISASTER 
HE STOPPED UNDERNEATH A LARGE CLOCK 
AND THE MOUSE HAD A TERRIBLE SHOCK 
THE CAT WAS BESIDE HIM WITH NO TIME FOR HIDING 
IT WAS TIME THE MOUSE RAN UP THE CLOCK 
THE HAND ON THE RIGHT THEN WENT DOWN 
SO CLOCKWISE THE CAT WENT AROUND 
BUT THE MOUSE HAND WENT ANTI THE MOUSE HE WENT FRANTIC 
THE CAT WORE A SMILE NOT A FROWN 
I'M NOT HERE TO EAT YOU I BROUGHT YOU SOME CHEESE YOU 
ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED ON THE GROUND 
THE ENDING IS CHEESY IT TURNED OUT SO EASY 
JUST AS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN WISHING 
THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR DIRECTION FROM FEAR TO AFFECTION 
A VERY MUCH NICER POSITION
