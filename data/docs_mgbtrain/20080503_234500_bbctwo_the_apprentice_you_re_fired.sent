I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR FORTY YEARS YOUR PRIZE IS WORKING WITH ME 
YOU'RE FIRED YOU'RE FIRED 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A BLOODY CLUE YOU'RE FIRED 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE APPRENTICE YOU'RE FIRED 
WHERE THE FRESHLY DISMISSED CANDIDATE IS FORCED 
TO FACE UP TO HIS FAILURE AGAIN 
WITH THE HELP OF OUR PANEL AND SOME UNSEEN FOOTAGE 
WE'LL LOOK AT HOW KEVIN TRIED TO SAVE THE WORLD 
BUT ENDED UP FAILING TO SAVE HIMSELF 
BRACE YOURSELF WE'LL SEE MORE OF ALEX THAN WE EVER HAVE BEFORE 
OH THAT'S BETTER 
I'VE JUST FARTED I ALWAYS DO THAT WHEN I FART 
OH HOO 
OH HOO 
ON OUR PANEL WE'VE SOMEONE WHO RUNS A SUCCESSFUL GREETINGS CARD BUSINESS JESSICA HUIE 
WE HAVE SIR ALAN'S RIGHT HAND MAN NICK HEWER 
AND A MUCH LOVED BROADCASTER LORRAINE KELLY WELCOME TO YOU ALL 
TONIGHT'S TASK OF CREATING A GREETING CARD FOR A NEW OCCASION 
MUST HAVE HAD KEVIN LOOKING FOR A COMMISERATION CARD TO SEND TO HIMSELF 
KEVIN THIS WHOLE TASK TURNED OUT A FIASCO AND AS TEAM LEADER 
I HOLD YOU TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE 
KEVIN YOU'RE FIRED 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE WELCOME KEVIN SHAW 
YOU WERE CONFIDENT GOING INTO THE BOARDROOM 
I THOUGHT YOU'D GET FIRED AFTER THE COOKING TASK 
I THOUGHT YOU'D SAVED YOURSELF AGAIN WHY NOT THIS TIME 
AS PROJECT MANAGER YOU HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 
AND I THINK I DECIDED TO GO AHEAD 
WITH BEING THE PITCHER FOR THE TASK 
I DID A BAD JOB 
I NEEDED TO GO AND I HOLD MY HANDS UP TO THAT I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 
AND SIR ALAN MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE BASED ON THAT TASK 
SUCH CONFIDENCE THOUGH YOU'RE NOT JUST VERY CONFIDENT OR EVEN ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CONFIDENT OR EVEN ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT CONFIDENT 
THIS IS HOW CONFIDENT YOU WERE KEVIN 
THIS IS HOW CONFIDENT YOU WERE KEVIN 
I'M TOTALLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT CONFIDENT 
I'M TOTALLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT CONFIDENT 
I CAN GO IN THERE AND NAIL THE PITCH 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT CONFIDENT NOT ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT 
THAT IS CONFIDENT LET'S SEE WHERE IT WENT WRONG 
ROAD TO NOWHERE BY TALKING HEADS 
WITH REGARDS TO THE PITCH 
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE THE PERSON THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO BUY FROM 
YEAH DEFINITELY YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DOES FOR A LIVING 
SHE IS A RETAIL BUYER 
THE CONCEPT IS SO STRONG I REALLY NEED TO BALLS IT UP BIG TIME 
FOR IT NOT TO SELL ITSELF 
SORT OF I'M MISSING THE POINT 
KEVIN'S PITCHING WAS DIABOLICAL 
I DON'T SEE SIR ALAN HATING THE IDEA 
THE LAST THING I'M GONNA DO IS BUY A CARD 
THAT HAS THE SOLE PURPOSE OF LECTURING ME ABOUT GREEN 
I DISAGREE WITH THAT IF YOU'RE ECO FRIENDLY WOULDN'T YOU SAVE THE PAPER 
THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS CARD IS WE'RE TRYING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE 
IT'S BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION 
KEVIN YOU'RE SINKING IN MY EYES YOUNG MAN 
WHAT'S THAT SINKING FEELING LIKE IN THE BOARDROOM 
WHEN HE'S SAYING YOUR PRODUCT IS RUBBISH 
IT'S HARD WHEN THE PENNY DROPS AND YOU REALISE IT'S RUBBISH AS WELL 
I THINK I WAS SINKING BEFORE HE MENTIONED IT 
VERY GOOD JESSICA YOU'RE IN THE CARD BUSINESS 
HOW DID YOU FEEL WATCHING THIS COULD YOU SEE THEY WERE MAKING A MISTAKE FROM AN EARLY STAGE 
YEAH ASIDE FROM ANYTHING ELSE IT WAS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS 
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY CARD 
YOU NEED TO DO AN E. CARD YOU CAN'T SEND A PAPER CARD 
AND IT JUST WASN'T RESEARCHED IT WASN'T WELL THOUGHT OUT 
NOT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE I AGREE 
LET'S LOOK AT YOUR CARDS 
TALK US THROUGH YOUR IDEA 
I FELL UPON A GAP IN THE MARKET 
FOR MULTI CULTURAL CARDS FEATURING PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES 
ONLY WHITE PEOPLE FEATURE ON CARDS DON'T THEY THAT'S RIGHT 
I THOUGHT IF I CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT HAS A MASS APPEAL 
AND NOT MARGINALISE MY MARKET WE'RE ON TO A WINNER 
WE STARTED OFF WITH THE INDEPENDENT STORES 
AND CHECKED THERE WAS A BIG ENOUGH MARKET TO MAKE THIS VIABLE 
AND THEY DID VERY WELL AND WE'RE IN ONE HUNDRED BRANCHES OF CLINTON CARDS 
AND LAUNCH IN THE STATES NEXT MONTH 
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THE PITCHING WITH CLINTON CARDS I HAVE 
WE'LL GO THROUGH THE PAIN OF THAT PITCHING PROCESS AGAIN SHORTLY 
LORRAINE WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THEIR IDEA 
A NEEJ I. 
IT WAS SO AWFUL 
IT'S SO NOT SOUND ENVIRONMENTALLY ANYWAY THERE WAS NO HUMOUR 
THE IDEA WAS REALLY BAD 
AND THE PITCH I WAS CRINGING FOR YOU 
YOU DID TRY TO OFFLOAD IT BUT IT WAS TOO LATE 
CRINGING IS A BIG PART OF THE APPRENTICE EXPERIENCE 
A LOT OF HIDING BEHIND THE SOFA ABSOLUTELY 
WITH A CUSHION IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE 
NICK WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ON THE IDEA 
WHEN DO YOU SEND IT 
WHAT PROMPTS YOU TO SEND IT 
WHEN YOU START UP YOUR FOUR BY FOUR 
YOU THINK I MUST SEND AN ENVIRONMENT CARD TODAY 
NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO CUT DOWN A TREE TO MAKE THE CARD 
AND ANOTHER FOR THE ENVELOPE A THIRD FOR THE STAMP 
THEN YOU HAVE TO DRIVE IT HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN A DIESEL TRUCK 
IT'S A HORRIBLE CONCEPT REALLY 
HERE WE GO THEY'RE QUITE WELL MADE AREN'T THEY 
THESE ARE DESIGNED RATHER WELL 
THE BLACK'S REALLY CLEVER 
IT'S A SHAME INSIDE IT'S REALLY PREACHY AND NOBODY'S GONNA BUY IT 
I'M AMAZED YOU GOT ANY ORDERS AT ALL 
I WAS THINKING THEY WOULDN'T GET ANY 
TESCO TOOK SOME PITY ON YOU 
THEY DID YEAH 
LET'S SEE WHAT AN ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERT 
THE BOSS OF GREENPEACE MADE OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS 
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
THAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING OF INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE WAYS 
TO GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT 
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES 
THAN HOW WE CAN SAVE PLANET EARTH 
BUT WHETHER YOU CAN DO THAT ON A CARD OUTSIDE OF A SPECIAL OCCASION 
LIKE A BIRTHDAY CHRISTMAS OR ANNIVERSARY SOMEHOW I DOUBT IT 
BASICALLY THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ARE FIRST YOU HAVE TO INSULATE YOUR HOME 
IT IS VERY PREACHY WHICH A LOT OF THESE CARDS ARE 
PARTICULARLY THE MESSAGES IN THEM 
THEY'RE A BIT HEAVY 
THEY'RE NOT PUT ACROSS IN A FUN AND EXCITING WAY 
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY ATTRACTIVE TO PEOPLE 
WOULD YOU GO ALONG WITH THAT ABSOLUTELY 
WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME WAS THE PITCH YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T GO INTO A PITCH 
AND START ACCUSING THE RETAILER OF WHAT THEY'RE NOT DOING AND BULLYING THEM 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AGGRESSIVE AND YOU DIDN'T ENDEAR YOURSELF TO CLINTONS 
YOU PITCHED TO CLINTON'S HOW DID YOU PREPARE 
I STOOD IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR AND BORED MY DAUGHTER ENDLESSLY 
TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS MUM NOT AGAIN 
BUT YOU HAVE TO PRACTISE I ALSO SPOKE TO AN INDEPENDENT FIRST 
TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS GOING TO BE INTEREST THERE 
YOUR CARDS WERE NEVER GOING TO CONVERT ANYBODY TO THE GREEN CAUSE 
BUT IRONICALLY YOU WERE CONVERTED 
YOU DIDN'T START OUT THAT WAY AT ALL AS WE CAN SEE HERE 
BY THE AGE OF TWENTY I HAD MY FIRST HOUSE BY THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE 
I HAD MY SECOND HOUSE BY THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE I HAD MY PORSCHE 
NOW I WANT A FERRARI 
LOVE OUR PLANET 
CERTAINLY A COMPANY OF YOUR SIZE AND YOUR WEIGHT COULD REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
I JUST NEED A LITTLE BELL HOW GOOD WOULD IT BE TO NOT ONLY KNOW THAT 
WE GO INTO THE BOARDROOM AND WIN BUT WIN WITH A REALLY POWERFUL STATEMENT 
AND THAT'S WE'VE MADE A DIFFERENCE 
A LOVE OUR PLANET WEEK COULD BE A MASSIVE THING 
IF PEOPLE ACTUALLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY 
THIS IS SHOWING YOU DON'T NEED A POWER SHOWER 
I'M PLEASED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH IT 
AND WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO BE AN AMBASSADOR MOVING FORWARD 
WE CAN ALL MAKE IT HAPPEN 
THERE WAS A SECTION IN THAT PITCH 
WHERE YOU WENT OVER THE TOP I THOUGHT 
YOU ACCUSED THE CLINTON'S PEOPLE OF BEING ON A PAR WITH GEORGE W. BUSH 
AND HIS REFUSAL TO SIGN THE KYOTO AGREEMENT HAVE A LOOK 
IF YOU DON'T PUT YOUR WEIGHT BEHIND IT THEN IT'S JUST THE SAME AS THE U. S. 
SAYING WE DON'T CARE ABOUT POLLUTION 
WE CAN SPEAK TO MIKE BOGLOVE FROM CLINTON'S CARDS 
MIKE YOU CAN'T EVER HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF THAT BEFORE 
BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR GLOBAL WARMING 
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF A LOT OF THINGS BUT NOT THAT ONE 
WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING ON THE END OF THAT PITCH A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE 
I THINK KEVIN REMEMBERS I HAD TO TELL HIM TO BACK OFF 
IT WAS LIKE BEING ATTACKED BY THREE ROTTWEILE RS 
HE WAS FULL ON AND I'VE NEVER HAD A PRESENTATION LIKE THAT 
IN ALL THE TIME I'VE BEEN DOING IT 
IT WAS FULL ON BUT IN TERMS OF YOUR CONVERSION TO THE GREEN CAUSE 
BY THE TIME YOU WERE DRIVING AWAY YOU WERE ON FIRE KEVIN 
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT THE ENVIRONMENT CLINTON CARDS 
ARE AN UN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY COMPANY 
IF THAT'S THE ATTITUDE EVERYONE TAKES WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAVE ANY PLANET 
ANY PLANET 
WHICH OTHER PLANETS WERE YOU MOVING ON TO PLUTO 
I THINK SO I THINK I WAS GOING OVER THE TOP THERE WASN'T I 
DO YOU TAKE ON BOARD WHAT MIKE SAID 
ABSOLUTELY I THINK GOING INTO THE APPRENTICE YOU GO THERE 
TO REALLY CHALLENGE YOURSELF IN A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT 
AND I WAS COMPLETELY OVER COMPETENT OR OVERCONFIDENT IF YOU LIKE 
FOR ME I FELT THAT AS A PROJECT MANAGER YOU NEEDED TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY 
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SOMEONE WHO IN THE TASK WAS IN THE BACKGROUND 
AND DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING FORWARDS SO IT WAS A RISK I TOOK 
I DID IT BADLY AND THE FIRST TWO PITCHES I WAS TRYING TO PITCH 
THE WAY CLAIRE AND JENNY SUGGESTED I SHOULD PITCH IT 
AND THEN BY THE LAST PITCH I SCRAPPED IT COMPLETELY 
AND DID WHAT I I FELT WAS RIGHT AND PUT MORE OF MY PERSONALITY INTO IT 
AND THAT WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL 
THE OTHER TEAM'S PATH WASN'T ALL PLAIN SAILING 
AND LED TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST DEBATES IN APPRENTICE HISTORY 
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS BUT WHERE TO PUT THAT APOSTROPHE 
NO IT'D BE AFTER THE S. 
IF YOU SAY THE DOG'S DINNER 
ONE DOG APOSTROPHE S. I'M AWARE OF THAT BUT DOESN'T THAT APPLY TO 
A VERB OR WHATEVER OR ADJECTIVE 
HELLO IS THAT THE TELEGRAPH YES 
CAN I GET PUT THROUGH TO THE EDITING DEPARTMENT PLEASE 
HI WE HAVEN'T HAD A DEFINITIVE ANSWER 
A NUMBER FOR THE BRITISH LIBRARY 
THERE'S AN APOSTROPHE AND IT'S EITHER AFTER THE LAST S. 
OR BEFORE THE LAST S. 
HELENE THINKS IT SHOULDN'T BE THERE AT ALL IF IT'S A HUGE ISSUE 
CAN IT NOT BE NATIONAL SINGLE DAY 
NO APOSTROPHE IN THE HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
HAS BEEN ARGUED OVER SO FIERCELY 
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AND I DON'T WANNA HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT IT 
I WILL PUT THE APOSTROPHE AFTER THE S. 
WE HAD A NATIONAL APOSTROPHE DAY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE OCCASION 
A WONDERFUL GOLDEN GOLDEN THREE HOURS THAT WAS 
IF ONLY THEY COULD HAVE GOT THROUGH TO WILLIAM LEWIS 
EDITOR OF THE TELEGRAPH 
YOU CAN IMAGINE HIM POUNDING OUT A HEAVY EDITORIAL ON THE IRAQ WAR 
AND HIS SECRETARY SAYS I'VE GOT MR. SOPHOCLES ON THE PHONE 
GLORIOUS STUFF 
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT IT I DON'T THINK I WANT TO SAY PUBLICLY 
I THINK IT'S BEFORE THE S. 
HEAR HEAR 
NO I DON'T KNOW AGAIN I THOUGHT IT WAS A RUBBISH IDEA 
WHO'S GOING TO BUY THOSE SILLY CARDS 
YOU'RE SINGLE ON VALENTINE'S DAY 
YOU IGNORE IT TWO FINGERS TO THE WORLD SOMEBODY SENDS YOU A CARD 
YOU'RE SINGLE I WISH I WAS 
I DON'T THINK IT WAS A SOUND IDEA AND THE TROUBLE WAS THAT 
NOBODY SAT AND THOUGHT ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO BE BUYING THESE CARDS 
THEY GOT CARRIED AWAY WITH THE IDEA BUT DIDN'T THINK 
WHO WILL TAKE THEIR PURSE AND BUY THEM AND SEND THEM TO SOMEONE 
LET'S SEE WHAT SIR ALAN AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY ABOUT YOU 
BEHIND YOUR BACK IN TRUE APPRENTICE STYLE 
IF EVER THERE WAS A TIME FOR ME TO LEAP ACROSS THE BOARDROOM TABLE 
AND WHACK SOMEONE ON THE CONK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THEN 
THE GUY WOULDN'T ACCEPT THAT HE'D GOT IT WRONG 
AND HE WOULDN'T ACCEPT THAT HE GOT HOODWINKED INTO THIS TASK BY JENNY 
DO YOU WANT TO GO AWAY FROM HERE AND GIVE US SOME SPACE 
KEVIN IS TEXTBOOK BRILLIANT UNTIL HE'S PUT UNDER PRESSURE 
AND THEN THAT TEXTBOOK GOES FLYING OUT OF THE WINDOW 
AND IN THE WINDOW COMES FLYING SOMEBODY WHO'S A VERY BAD LEADER 
THE SECOND PITCH WAS AWFUL 
KEVIN WAS LIKE A PIT BULL TERRIER BARKING AT THEM ACROSS THE TABLE 
I NEVER LOST A PITCH IN MY LIFE HE SAID 
HE CERTAINLY LOST THE BIGGEST PITCH PITCHING TO ME IN THE BOARDROOM 
AND THAT'S WHY I FIRED HIM 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT IT'S QUITE AN HONOUR THE FIRST CANDIDATE HE'S FELT LIKE PUNCHING 
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD 
NO I THINK VALID COMMENTS 
I'VE SEEN THE SHOW AND I TAKE ON BOARD WHAT PEOPLE SAY 
AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR DEVELOPMENT 
THAT YOU GET THAT FEEDBACK IN TERMS OF YOUR COMPETENCE ON THE SHOW 
THERE'S TWO HALVES ARE YOU ANY GOOD AT THE TASK 
IN THIS CASE WITH RESPECT NO 
ALSO NO TO ARE YOU ANY GOOD AT BOARDROOM TACTICS 
HE MISSED A TRICK DIDN'T HE LORRAINE 
ABSOLUTELY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WERE THINKING OF 
YOU BROUGHT IN THE WRONG PEOPLE 
YOU REALLY DID THE PERSON WHO WAS STEAM ROLLING THAT 
AND WHAT WAS REALLY MAD ABOUT JENNY I'M GETTING CROSS NOW 
WHAT WAS REALLY BONKERS WAS SHE ACTUALLY EXOCETED HER OWN IDEA 
SHE SAT THERE AT ONE OF THE PITCHES AND SAID I'M SO CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT I DON'T BUY CARDS 
NOT ONLY DID SHE DEMOLISH HER OWN IDEA 
BUT WHEN SHE WAS ENTHUSING ABOUT IT EARLIER 
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CLIP EVEN AS SHE'S TALKING ABOUT YOUR CONVERSION 
TO GREENNESS YOU CAN SEE SHE ENDS UP BORING HERSELF AT THE END OF IT LOOK AT THIS 
I'VE EVEN SPOKEN TO KEV TODAY ABOUT HIM GIVING UP HIS PORSCHE 
AND TRADING THAT IN FOR A BICYCLE GOODNESS KNOWS 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BY TOMORROW 
SHE HAD TO GO BUT SHE ESCAPED LET'S SEE HOW SHE ESCAPED 
WHO WAS THE PRIME INNOVATOR OF THIS TOPIC THAT WAS ME SIR ALAN 
ANOTHER ONE WAS THE ENVIRONMENT 
WE'RE GETTING A HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS THAT'S GROWING IN THE U. K. 
I PERSONALLY HAVE SLOWED DOWN ENORMOUSLY 
ON THE NUMBER OF CARDS I BUY BECAUSE I'M AWARE OF 
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ALL THE PAPER THAT WE'RE SENDING 
HOW CAN YOU MAKE A STATEMENT ON ONE SIDE SAYING THAT 
I PERSONALLY DON'T BUY SO MANY CARDS ANYMORE FOR THIS REASON 
AND THEN COME UP WITH A CONCEPT INITIALLY OF THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO 
JENNY CAME UP WITH A CONCEPT WE AGREED THE CONCEPT WAS NO GOOD 
WHICH TWO ARE YOU BRINGING BACK IN THE BOARDROOM 
I'M GOING TO BRING SARA AND CLAIRE 
WHY IS JENNY NOT IN THIS ROOM JENNY FROM START TO FINISH WORKED VERY HARD 
VERY HARD ON A POOR IDEA 
VERY HARD SHE RAILROADED YOU INTO DOING THIS SHE DIDN'T RAILROAD ME 
I THINK SHE RAN THIS BLOODY TASK 
WHEN HE SAYS WHY ISN'T JENNY IN THE ROOM 
WHAT YOU SHOULD SAY IS I'LL GET HER BACK 
VERY GOOD POINT 
WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE HER IN AT THE TIME WHEN WE LOST 
I WANTED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TASK AND AT THE TIME 
I WAS THINKING CAN I REALLY HOLD SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE 
FOR COMING UP WITH AN IDEA THAT WE ALL SAID 
RIGHT LET'S GO WITH THAT 
THIS IS THE APPRENTICE YOU'RE BEING RATHER MORAL 
IT'S A FIGHT TO THE DEATH ISN'T IT NICK 
IT CERTAINLY IS 
A TERRIBLE ERROR 
YOU REALLY BLEW IT 
AND YOU WERE A BIT WEAK 
RIGHT 
ALL RIGHT DON'T KICK A MAN WHILE HE'S DOWN 
HE PUT HIS HANDS UP 
POINTING THE FINGER AT SARA WAS A MISTAKE AND NOT A BRAVE ONE 
SIR ALAN SAID THAT 
THERE WERE SOME MAD IDEAS FOR CARDS THE GREEN IDEA WE'VE AGREED 
WASN'T A GREAT ONE AND THE SINGLES DAY WASN'T A GREAT ONE 
THERE'S ANOTHER WEIRD ONE YOU MENTION SAVING ANOTHER PLANET 
SOMETHING AKIN TO THAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ON THE DRAWING BOARD 
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE SINGLES TEAM DO IN THEIR PLANNING 
I WAS ALARMED TO SEE THAT 
ALIENS WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT 
YES THEY HAD AN IDEA ABOUT ALIENS LOOK AT THIS 
ANOTHER IDEA I HAD WAS ALIENS 
WHERE YOU ALIENS 
YOU PUT A SPIN ON MAYBE ALIENS VISITING THE EARTH 
WHO'S GOING TO BUY IT 
YOU BUY THEM FOR THE ALIENS 
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'RE COMING 
IT'S A JOVIAL THING IT'S LIKE YOU'RE TAKING THE MICK 
HOW IS THAT AN OCCASION 
THE OCCASION IS THAT THE ALIENS ARE COMING TO EARTH 
THAT'S THE OCCASION 
FANTASTIC YOU WERE SITTING THERE THINKING HE'S RIGHT 
THERE COULD BE SOMETHING IN THAT 
YOU'VE GOT MULTICULTURAL CARDS AND YOU HAVE ALIENS 
WHAT WERE THEY ON LORRAINE THAT WAS MAD 
BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE ARE CARDS FOR EVERYTHING NOW 
THINKING UP AN IDEA WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT 
YOU SAW A REALLY GOOD GAP IN THE MARKET AND WENT FOR IT 
JENNIFER MAGUIRE LOOKS OTHER WORLDLY 
NICK WAS THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN BEFORE HE STARTED ON THE APPRENTICE 
AND NOW LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED 
RAEF I DON'T KNOW WHAT PLANET HE'S FROM 
WITH HIS PITCHING STYLE WE HAD THIS IN A PREVIOUS APPRENTICE SERIES 
THEY DO IT WITH SOME KIND OF IMPORT 
IT'S LIKE THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS OR SOMETHING RAEF WAS WORD PERFECT 
BUT I'M NOT SURE THE TONE'S QUITE RIGHT 
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT PITCHING TOMORROW 
I AM LITERALLY IN MY ELEMENT WHEN I HAVE GOT AN AUDIENCE 
AND A CAPTIVATED AUDIENCE AT THAT SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD 
TO BASICALLY ORGANISING WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY AND THEN SAY IT 
LET US CELEBRATE THAT IN THE WAY PEOPLE KNOW BEST 
THE WAY YOU KNOW BEST 
IT IS WITH THIS IN MIND 
THAT I STAND BEFORE YOU AND OFFER YOU OUR PRODUCT 
AND SAY THROUGH OUR CARDS WE PUT FORWARD TO YOU 
THE NOTION OF A SINGLES DAY 
WE HAVE CREATED NOT ONLY A PRODUCT FOR YOU BUT A DIARY ENTRY 
THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING NOW CAN YOU PLEASE SHUT THE FUCK UP 
RAEF THE MAN OF WORDS WORDS ARE HIS TOOLS REMEMBER 
SO HE TALKED OF A CAPTIVATED AUDIENCE RATHER THAN A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT MR. SOPHOCLES TO WHOM YOU REFERRED EARLIER NICK 
AND I'VE GOT TO SHOW YOU THIS CLIP 
OF WHEN MICHAEL OVERDID THE EXCITEMENT WHEN HE ACTUALLY WON 
MUCH TO MARGARET AND SIR ALAN'S HORROR 
COME ON COME ON 
THIS IS NOT A FOOTBALL MATCH 
THIS OUTBURST OF YOURS WHICH IS 
NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD CONDONE I APOLOGISE I APOLOGISE 
PLAINLY HE SAID IT WAS LIKE A FOOTBALL MATCH MARGARET HASN'T BEEN TO A FOOTBALL MATCH 
I TEXTED HER I SAID YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR FACE IN THE BOARDROOM 
IT LOOKED AS THOUGH YOU HAD WITNESSED A MASSACRE 
SHE TEXTED BACK AND SAID OH THAT I HAD 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE MARGARET WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MICHALE SOPHOCLES 
OOH I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HIM AT ALL 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS UNSEEMLY HE WAS LIKE A YOBBO 
SO LORRAINE MICHAEL DOESN'T TWEAK YOUR METERS 
WHAT ABOUT ALEX ARE YOU AS BIG ON HIM 
HE'S TOO PRETTY FOR ME I DON'T LIKE A BOY THAT'S TOO PRETTY 
I WOULDN'T LIKE A MAN WHO SPENDS LONGER IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR THAN ME 
AND HE CLEARLY DOES 
I DIDN'T HAVE YOU DOWN AS THIS FUSSY LORRAINE TO BE HONEST 
IT'S NICE TO KNOW HE IS CUTE BUT TOO CUTE FOR ME 
YOU DON'T WANT SOMEONE WHO'S PRETTIER THAN YOU I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH ALEX ABSOLUTELY 
LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE HERE'S SOME MORE CLOSE UPS OF ALEX'S ARSE 
HOW DOES IT FEEL DOWN THERE 
IT'S QUITE WARM AND SQUIDGY 
STOP IT JUST DO IT AH THAT'S BETTER 
I'VE GOT IT GIRLS DO IT FAST 
WHOA THAT'S MUCH BETTER 
I'M A MODEL 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
AND I DO MY LITTLE TURN ON THE CATWALK 
STILL NOT CONVINCED 
BOYS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO WEAR ANYTHING UNDER THEIR KILT 
IT'S THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ALL SORTS OF THINGS GO ON UNDER KILTS 
THERE IS A NEW FEATURE ISN'T THERE NICK IN THIS SERIES 
WHERE THEY HAVE THREE SEPERATE BOARDROOMS 
AND FINISH WITH THE DRAMA OF WHO IS GOING TO GET FIRED 
NOW THEY ARE HAVING A SUPPLEMENTARY BOARDROOM OF THEIR OWN 
WHEN THEY GET BACK TO THE HOUSE 
POOR OLD SARA WHAT DID SHE DO TO DESERVE THIS 
IF FOUR PEOPLE OUT OF FIVE THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T CONTRIBUTE 
HOW ARE YOU SITTING ON THAT SOFA 
I DID GET INVOLVED IN THE MARKET RESEARCH SIDE OF THINGS 
THE FACT IS IF YOU DON'T PERFORM YOU'RE OUT SIMPLE AS THAT 
IF YOU DON'T STEP UP TO THE MARK 
YOU'RE GOING INTO THE BOARDROOM SIMPLE AS THAT END OF STORY 
MATE MATE MATE MATE 
THIS IS A RELIVING OF THE BOARDROOM YOU DON'T NEED TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS 
A DECISION HAS BEEN MADE 
SIR ALAN HAS MADE IT WE DO NOT NEED TO FIRE QUESTIONS AT HER 
AS TO WHY SHE DID AND DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 
IF I WANT TO ASK MY OPINION I WILL ALEXANDER 
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD ASK THEM TOO MANY PEOPLE STAY QUIET 
I CAN EXPRESS MY OPINION WHENEVER AND TO WHOEVER I WANT I DON'T NEED YOUR PERMISSION 
BY THE SAME TOKEN ALLOW ME TO SAY WHAT I WANT TO SAY 
WHICH IS I THINK IT IS INAPPROPRIATE 
BUT YOU 
BLESSED IS RAEF THE PEACEMAKER 
THAT WAS HORRIBLE THAT WAS LIKE A LITTLE GAZELLE 
AND A WHOLE LOAD OF JACKALS AND HYENAS ATTACKING THIS WEE GIRL 
I REALLY WANTED HER TO STAND UP FOR HERSELF 
I'M WORRIED SHE'S GOING TO GO RIGHT INTO HER SHELL AND DISAPPEAR 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT JESSICA I LOVE RAEF I'M HIS BIGGEST FAN 
HE WAS LIKE A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOUR TO SARA'S DEFENCE 
BUT I DO WANT TO PINCH SARA AND SAY ASSERT YOURSELF YOU KNOW THIS IS THE APPRENTICE 
LET'S LOOK AT A A COUPLE OF REAL STARS THAT'S YOUR GOOD SELF AND MARGARET 
WE HAD WE'RE ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH 
AND WE'VE HAD SOME FANTASTIC STUFF FROM YOU BOTH 
SOMEBODY'S WATCHING ME BY ROCKWELL 
BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE CONSTELLATION 
I KNOW ABOUT SETTING UP A TRIPOD AND A CAMERA 
YOU NEVER ALEXANDER YOU STEPPED SO FAR BACK FROM IT 
YOU WERE PRACTICALLY OUT OF THE ROOM 
I THINK I DID IT AGAIN 
I'VE ALWAYS FELT THERE IS A BIT OF A CHILL IN THE AIR 
WE GOT TEN EXTRA EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ASKING FOR TIPS 
WELL 
WHAT 
YOU VERY RARELY SEE HER WITH HER SPECS ON BUT SHE HAD THEM ON THEN ALL RIGHT DIDN'T SHE 
I MUST ASK HER ABOUT THAT 
JESSICA HAS DECLARED HER HAND FOR RAEF WHO IS FLOATING YOUR BOAT 
YOU KNOW FUNNILY ENOUGH AND YOU MIGHT FIND THIS ODD BUT CLAIRE 
I'LL TELL YOU FOR WHY I LOVED THE BADGER 
AND SHE STARTED OFF A WEE BIT LIKE CLAIRE 
AND THEN SIR ALAN MARKED HER CARD 
AND THAT'S HAD AN EFFECT ON CLAIRE AND MAYBE WE WILL SEE HER GETTING 
A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND A LITTLE BIT LESS AGGRESSIVE 
WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS SIR ALAN LOOKING FOR NICK 
THEY HAVE GOT TO BE HONEST PERSUASIVE AND MULTI TALENTED 
HE WANTS A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF SKILLS 
STAMINA 
KEVIN IT HAS BEEN SAID IN SEVERAL NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS 
AND ON THIS SHOW THAT YOU BEAR 
I CAN'T SEE IT MYSELF I SHOULD SAY 
BUT YOU BEAR A LIKENESS TO A WELL KNOWN COMEDY CHARACTER 
KEVIN LOOKS LIKE DAVID THE ONLY GAY IN THE VILLAGE 
HE LOOKS LIKE MATT LUCAS GREAT PERSON TO LOOK LIKE HE IS VERY POPULAR 
THIS IS DAVID WISHING YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
AND REMINDING YOU I AM THE ONLY GAY IN THE VILLAGE 
THAT IS SO HILARIOUS 
HE'D GO MAD IF HE SAW THAT 
I AM THE ONLY GAY IN THE VILLAGE 
THEY SAID YOU A SENSE OF HUMOUR FAILURE ABOUT THIS DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE A RESEMBLANCE 
I WAS TRYING TO WORK IT OUT EARLIER WHETHER 
WE LOOK SIMILAR AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SAID IT TO ME 
FOR LONG BEFORE THE APPRENTICE AND I HAVEN'T GOT A PROBLEM WITH IT 
HE'S A GREAT GUY I HAVE NO ISSUES WITH IT WHATSOEVER 
RIGHT GREAT LET'S GO TO THE VOTE THEN 
WAS THE RIGHT DECISION MADE LORRAINE 
FROM THE PEOPLE IN THE BOARDROOM THE RIGHT DECISION WAS MADE 
BUT YOU MISSED A TRICK 
IF YOU HAD TAKEN JENNY IN I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE GONE

AFRAID SO KEVIN AS YOU SAY WRONG DECISION IN THE BOARDROOM 
YES KEVIN SHOULD HAVE GONE I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION
