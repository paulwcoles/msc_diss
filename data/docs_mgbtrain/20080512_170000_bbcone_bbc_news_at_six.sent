EARTHQUAKE HIT CHINA IT LASTED 
ONLY MINUTE OR SO BUT IN THOSE 
FEW DEVASTATING SECONDS BUILDINGS 
CRUMBLED AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE WERE KILLED OR BURIED ALIVE 
EVERY NEW REPORT REVEALS THE SCALE 
OF THE DISASTER WITH ACCOUNTS OF 
HOSPITALS AND FACTORIES COLLAPSING 
IN ONE DISTRICT NINE HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE 
REPORTED TO BE UNDER THE RUBBLE OF 
THEIR SCHOOL IT MEASURED SEVENTY EIGHT THE 
BIGGEST DEFEAT THE COUNTRY FOR OVER 
THIRTY YEARS THE EPICENTRE WAS FIFTY SEVEN 
MILES FROM THE CITY OF CHENGDU IN 
THE SICHUAN PROVINCE IT COVERS A 
VAST AREA AND IS HEAVILY POPULATED 
HOME TO MORE THAN EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE 
TONIGHT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
ITSELF WAS FORCED TO ADMIT IT WAS 
FACING A MAJOR DISASTER LET'S 
CROSS TO BEIJING AND QUENTIN 
SOMERVILLE 
CHINA 
IS A COUNTRY THAT SOMERVILLE IS USED TO DEALING WITH CATASTROPHE IS ON A VAST SCALE BUT WHAT IS 
UNFOLDING NOW IS THE GREATEST 
NATURAL DISASTER TO HIT CHINA IN 
MANY DECADES IT CAME UNEXPECTEDLY 
THERE WAS NO TIME TO PREPARE THERE 
WAS NO TIME TO FIND SHELTER 
IT STRUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
SCHOOL DAY LIKE MOST THIS STUDENT 
HAD LITTLE TIME TO SEEK SHELTER 
FROM THE BIGGEST EARTHQUAKE TO HIT 
SOUTH WESTERN CHINA IN THIRTY YEARS HE 
HIDES UNDER HIS DESK AS HIS BOOKS 
FOR AROUND HIM FURTHER NORTH A 
PUPIL ALLIES TRAPPED IN DUJIANGYAN 
HELP ARRIVED QUICKLY AND PARENTS 
WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR NEWS OF THEIR 
MISSING CHILDREN ANOTHER FIVE 
SCHOOLS COLLAPSED NEAR BY IT IS 
NOT KNOWN HOW MANY ARE TRAPPED IN 
CHUM DO AFTERSHOCKS KEPT COMING 
CHENGDU THIS HOSPITAL WAS 
EVACUATED MOST OF THE CITY OF TEN 
MILLION PEOPLE TOOK TO THE STREETS 
MANY SPENT THE NIGHT THERE TOO 
FEARFUL TO RETURN A ONE THOUSAND MILES 
AWAY IN BEIJING THE EARTHQUAKE WAS 
FELT AND IN SHANGHAI BUILDINGS 
SHOOK WITHIN A MATTER OF HOURS 
CHINA'S PRIME MINISTER WAS HEADING 
TO THE SCENE HE SAID THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO PANIC 
WITH CONFIDENCE COURAGE AND STRONG 
GUIDANCE WITH A JOINT EFFORT WE 
CAN DEFINITELY CONQUER THIS HUGE 
EARTHQUAKE EARTHQUAKE THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY HAS 
BEEN DEPLOYED THE AIR FORCE TWO 
BUT THE EPICENTRE OF THE QUAKE LIES 
DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS LANDSLIDES 
ARE MAKING ACCESS DIFFICULT THIS 
IS A COUNTRY USED TO DEALING WITH 
CATASTROPHE BUT THIS IS THE 
BIGGEST NATURAL DISASTER TO HIT 
CHINA IN DECADES FROM THE SOUTH TO 
THE NORTH MOST OF THIS VAST 
COUNTRY FELT THE EARTHQUAKE 
TONIGHT AS MANY REMAIN CAMPED OUT 
WALL OF CHINA WILL BE WATCHING AS 
TROOPS AND RESCUE WORKERS SEARCHED 
FOR SURVIVORS 
LET'S GET THE LATEST NOW FROM 
BEIJING QUENTIN EVEN FOR A 
COUNTRY WITH CHINA'S RESOURCES THIS 
IS GOING TO BE AN ENORMOUS 
CHALLENGE ISN'T IT ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY BUT CHINA IS DETERMINED TO MEET 
THIS CHALLENGE THE COUNTRY IS USED 
TO DEALING WITH NATURAL DISASTERS 
EVERY YEAR REGULARLY THEY MANAGED 
TO TEMPORARILY EVACUATED HOMES AND 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHEN TYPHOON 
SEASON HITS THE PEOPLE'S 
LIBERATION ARMY WHO ARE ON THE 
GROUND I USED TO DEALING WITH HUGE 
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AND GETTING THEM 
TO SAFETY THE DIFFICULTY IN THIS 
CASE IS THAT THE AREA IS CUT OFF 
IT IS IN THE MOUNTAINS WE BELIEVE 
THAT THE TROOPS ARE AT LEAST SIXTY 
MILES AWAY FROM REACHING THE 
EPICENTRE EPICENTRE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WELL AS THE DISASTER UNFOLDED 
THROUGH THE DAY EYEWITNESSES HAVE 
BEEN GIVING THEIR ACCOUNTS TO THE 
B. B. C. DANIEL EBBUTT IS STUDYING AT 
SICHUAN UNIVERSITY IN THE 
PROVINCIAL CAPITAL CHENGDU 
I WAS 
IN MY APARTMENT WHICH IS ON THE 
SEVENTH FLOOR OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING 
ON CAMPUS EVERYTHING JUST STARTED 
SHAKING IT WAS VERY SCARY THINGS 
WERE FALLING OFF SHELVES INITIALLY 
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY BUILDING THAT 
WAS FALLING DOWN L. LIVE ON THE TOP 
DRAWER AND I WASN'T SURE IF ANY 
EFFECT HAD BEEN AMPLIFIED WITH 
BEING SO HIGH UP L. THOUGHT IT WAS 
JUST MY BUILDING THAT WAS FALLING 
DOWN I GLANCE AT THE WINDOW AND 
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SHAKING 
AS I 
WAS STANDING THE FLOOR JUST BEGAN 
TO SHAKE THE WINDOWS STARTED TO 
RATTLE SOMEONE YELLED EARTHQUAKE 
SUDDENLY MY CLASS WAS EMPTY AS 
SOON AS I GOT OUTSIDE THERE WAS AN 
OLDER STYLE BUILDING CHINESE STYLE 
WITH CLAY ROOF TILES THEY ALL FELL 
OFF I JUST HAD THIS BIG CRASH IT 
WAS KIND OF NERVE RACKING 
JUST A COUPLE THE FIRST HAND 
ACCOUNTS WE HAVE BEEN GETTING UP 
THE B. B. C. WELL CHINA IS NO STRANGER 
TO MAJOR EARTHQUAKES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX 
NEARLY QUARTER A MILLION PEOPLE 
DIED IN AN EARTHQUAKE ROBERT HALL 
HAS BEEN LOOKING AT WHY THE REGION 
IS PRONE TO SUCH MASSIVE TREMORS 
THE RISK IS CONSTANT AND CHINA HAS 
LEARNED TO EXPECT THE WORST THESE 
IMAGES WERE CAPTURED DURING THE 
GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX THE CITY 
OF TANGSHAN ON MAJOR FAULT LINE 
WAS SHAKEN BY A TREMOR THAT CLAIMED 
AT LEAST HALF A MILLION LIVES 
CHINA IS ONE OF THE MOST 
SEISMICALLY ACTIVE REASONS 
REGIONS OF THE WORLD HERE IS WHAT 
GEOLOGISTS BELIEVE HAS CAUSED THE 
LATEST QUAKE TWO OF THE TECTONIC 
PLATES THAT FORM THE EARTH'S 
SURFACE MEET ME INDIA THE INDIAN 
PLATE IS PUSHING AGAINST THE 
EURASIAN PLATE THIS CAN CAUSE 
VIBRATIONS ALONG FAULT LINES IN 
SICHUAN PROVINCE EXPERTS BELIEVE 
ONE LAYER OF ROCK HAS COLLIDED 
WITH ANOTHER LEADING TO 
DEVASTATING TREMORS EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKES CAN OCCUR AT ANY DEPTH DOWN TO SIX HUNDRED 
KILOMETERS IF THEY ARE VERY DEEP 
NOT MUCH OF IT GETS TO THE SURFACE 
IT IS NEAR THE SURFACE IT IS THERE 
TO DAMAGE BUILDINGS AND KILL PEOPLE 
TODAY'S QUAKE IN SUCH ONE IS THE 
FIRST SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY THREE WHEN TEN THOUSAND WERE 
KILLED SINCE THEN MUCH OF 
THE AREA HAS BEEN DEVELOPED 
RELATIVELY FEW PROPORTIONS HOWEVER 
TO PROTECT CLIMBS FROM THE TREMORS 
ARE MEASURED HERE IN THE U. K. WHAT WHAT IS SO AWFUL ABOUT THIS KIND OF 
CONSTRUCTION WHEN IT COLLAPSES LIKE 
BEST IS THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE 
HEAVY STONE BLOCKS THAT JUST 
COLLAPSE COMPLETELY A LOT OF THIS 
WILL TURN TO DUST AS WELL PEOPLE 
THINK OF THE CAUSE OF DEATH IN AN 
EARTHQUAKE AS BEING STRUCK BY 
STONES OF BEING CRUSHED BUT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WILL ALSO BE SUFFOCATED 
THE DISASTER WILL BRING RENEWED 
CALLS FOR GREATER INVESTMENT IN 
PREPARING FOR THE WORST ONCE AGAIN 
IT IS MAN MADE STRUCTURES WHICH ARE 
CONTRIBUTING TO THIS RISING DEATH 
TOLL TOLL YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ON THE 
EARTHQUAKE BY GOING TO OUR WEBSITE 
HERE POLICE INVESTIGATING THE 
MURDER OF TEENAGER IN SOUTH EAST 
LONDON SAY THEY HAVE BEEN 
INTERVIEWING A KEY WITNESS 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIMMY MIZEN WAS

MASS AT HIS SCHOOL AND PAID TRIBUTE 
TO GENTLE AND COMPASSIONATE 
TEENAGER BEN ANDO IS AT THE SCENE 
ON THE DAY WHEN THE INVESTIGATIONS 
ARE MOVING RAPIDLY POLICE SAY THEY 
HAVE A PRIME SUSPECT AND THE NET IS 
CLOSING IN AWAY FROM THE 
INVESTIGATION ON THEIR LAST DAY OF 
SCHOOL JIMMY MIZEN'S FRIENDS HAVE 
BEEN COMING DOWN HERE TO PAY 
TRIBUTE AND LAY FLOWERS NONE OF 
THEM COULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT ON 
THE DAY THEY SAY GOODBYE TO SCHOOL 
THEY WOULD ALSO SAY GOODBYE TO 
JIMMY 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS LAST JIMMY DAY AT SCHOOL AND FELLOW PUPILS 
LEFT THEIR TIES AND OTHER MESSAGES 
AMONG THE FLOWERS AT HIS SCHOOL 
CONDOLENCES AND A PRAYER OF 
COMPASSION AND LOVE FOR A YOUNGSTER 
SAID TO BE A GENTLE GIANT AFTER A 
MEMORIAL MASS HIS PARENTS 
DESCRIBED THEIR KIND LOVING SON 
HE WAS SO HAPPY HE WAS LIFE AND 
SOUL OF THE PARTY JUST COMING UP 
TO WAS ALL ALL RIGHT MUM JUST 
AFFECTIONATE EVERYTHING THAT SHE 
NEEDED WAS FANTASTIC 
HE WAS IDEA 
SWEET YOUNG MAN WE LOVED HIM ON 
HIS BIRTHDAY HE WAS JUST GOING OUT 
WITH SOME FRIENDS WE CUDDLED HIM 
NOTHING UNUSUAL WE SAID THAT WE 
LOVE HIM THAT'S GREAT THAT'S A 
GREAT MEMORY FOR ME 
JIMMY DIED ON 
SATURDAY AFTER GOING TO BUY A 
LOTTERY TICKET NEAR HIS HOME IN LEE 
AT ELEVEN FIFTY AM IT WAS AT THIS BAKERY 
WHEN HE WAS FATALLY WOUNDED AS HE 
LAY DYING IN HIS BROTHER'S ARMS 
INSIDE THE BAKERY HIS ATTACKER RAN 
OUT AND MADE OFF ACROSS THE STREET 
HE THEN SPRINTED UP THE HIGH STREET 
HERE IN LEE AS AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE 
GAVE CHASE HE ROUNDED THE CORNER 
HERE BEFORE MAKING OFF THROUGH THE 
ESTATE AND MAKING GOOD HIS ESCAPE 
AT THE SCENE WHITE SUITED 
FORENSICS OFFICERS CARRIED OUT THE 
SEARCH FOR CLUES FINGERPRINTS OR 
SIGNS TO SHOW HOW JIMMY DIED YET 
THERE REMAINS NO CLUE AS TO EMOTIVE 
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT MESSAGES FOR 
JIMMY'S SAY MUCH THE SAME THING 
THAT THEY WILL MISS A KIND AND MUCH 
LOVED SCHOOLMATE WHO DIED IN AN 
APPARENTLY SENSELESS AND RANDOM ACT 
OF VIOLENCE 
WELL DETECTIVES SAY THAT TODAY 
THEY HAVE SEIZED VITAL C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE 
AND ALSO THE FORENSIC SEARCH IN THE 
BAKERY HAS YIELDED VERY IMPORTANT 
INFORMATION ENABLING THEM TO BUILD 
UP A PROFILE OF THIS PRIME SUSPECT 
AT THE MOMENT THEY ARE NOT 
RELEASING A NAME AND THEY ARE NOT 
PURSUING ANY KIND OF DESCRIPTION 
RIGHT NOW AT LEAST THE MOTIVE IS 
APPARENTLY A SENSELESS ATTACK AND 
IT REMAINS A MYSTERY 
THE FIRST U. S. AID FLIGHT TO BURMA 
LANDED IN THE CAPITAL RANGOON TODAY 
THE PLANE WAS CARRYING MOSQUITO 
NETS BLANKETS AND DRINKING WATER 
U. S. OFFICIALS SAY THEY COULD AIRLIFT 
TEN TIMES AS MUCH EVERY DAY IF THEY 
WERE GIVEN PERMISSION BY BURMA'S 
SECRETIVE MILITARY GOVERNMENT FROM 
BANGKOK ANDREW HARDING REPORTS ON 
DIPLOMACY AFTER DAYS OF HAGGLING THE AID WAS SWIFTLY SEIZED BY THE 
BURMESE MILITARY AND THE AMERICANS 
WERE POLITELY TOLD TO LEAVE IN THE 
DISASTER ZONE THERE WERE SOME 
SIGNS OF PROGRESS TODAY MORE 
EMERGENCY SUPPLIES ARE NOW 
BEGINNING TO GET THROUGH TO THE 
SURVIVORS THIS RISE BROUGHT IN BY 
THE UNITED NATIONS A FRACTION OF 
WHAT IS NEEDED BUT STILL FACE A 
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT RICE 
THE WHOLE EFFORT HAS REALLY SHIFTED 
GEARS WE HAVE PROBABLY DOUBLED THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
REACHED IN THE LAST TWO DAYS 
THINK MUCH MORE IS GETTING OUT TO 
PEOPLE THAT NEED IT 
OUT IN THE 
DELTA HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE 
STILL LIVING LIKE THIS DRINKING 
FROM CONTAMINATED WATER LITTERED 
WITH CORPSES 
RIGHT NOW TEN DAYS ON IT IS STILL 
THOUGHT THAT LESS THAN A THIRD OF 
THOSE IN NEED ARE GETTING SOME AID 
IT WOULD TAKE ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED TONS OF 
FOOD A DAY TO FEED THOSE IN NEED 
RIGHT NOW LESS THAN ONE FIFTH OF 
THAT IS GETTING THROUGH AS FOR 
TRUCKS AND BOATS STAFF AND 
HELICOPTERS THERE IS LESS THAN 
ONE TENTH OF WHAT IS REQUIRED THIS 
OPERATION BARELY OFF THE GROUND 
THE RESULT CAMPS PACKED WITH 
HOMELESS FAMILIES ARE INCREASINGLY 
THREATENED BY DYSENTERY AND CHOLERA 
IN THE RUINS OF HER HOME THIS 
WOMAN COMPLAINS THAT SHE HAS 
RECEIVED ONLY A HANDFUL OF RICE IT 
IS NOT ENOUGH SHE SAYS FOR NOW 
BURMA'S RULERS REMAIN DETERMINED TO 
SHRUG OFF INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE 
HANDLING THIS DISASTER ON THEIR OWN 
TERMS BUT FOR THE STRUGGLING 
SURVIVORS IT IS A HIGH RISK 
STRATEGY STRATEGY GORDON BROWN MADE A KEYNOTE SPEECH 
ON CARE FOR THE ELDERLY TODAY IT 
WAS MEANT TO BE PART OF A FIGHTBACK 
AFTER THOSE TERRIBLE LOCAL ELECTION 
RESULTS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS 
LEADERSHIP BUT THE TENSIONS WITHIN 
THE PARTY ARE IN THE OPEN AGAIN 
FRANK FIELD THE M. P. WHO LED THE 
REVOLT AGAINST THE SCRAPPING OF THE 
TEN P. TAX BAND BAND HAS SAID THAT 
GORDON BROWN IS UNLIKELY TO BE 
LEADING THE PARTY AT THE NEXT 
ELECTION LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS 
WITH NICK ROBINSON A VERY DAMAGING 
COMMENT IT IS BEGINNING TO SOUND 
LIKE A BIT OF A WAR 
A LOT OF 
FAMOUS FOOTBALLERS HAVE JUST GONE 
IN FOR A RECEPTION WITH GORDON 
BROWN IF REFEREES WERE ON THE 
FIELD OF LABOUR PLAY THERE WOULD 
BE A LOT OF RED AND YELLOW CARDS 
BEING HANDED OUT FRANK FIELD SAYS 
THAT GORDON BROWN WILL NOT BE THE 
LEADER OF THE PARTY AT THE NEXT 
ELECTION AND SAYS HE SHOULD TAKE 
ADVICE FROM THOSE HE LOVES MOST ED 
BALLS VERY CLOSE TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND THE FAMILIES AND 
SCHOOL SECRETARY HE THEN ATTACKS 
PEOPLE WHO HE SAYS ARE GUILTY OF 
PERSONAL ATTACKS AND SETTLING GILTS 
SCORES HE SAID THAT UP UNTIL 
THEN FRANK FIELD'S BEHAVED 
HONOURABLY 
WHAT ABOUT THE TEN P. TAX BATTLES 
THERE IS NOT LONG TO WAIT AS SOON 
AS TOMORROW I AM TOLD WE MAY HEAR 
THE DETAIL OF HOW THE GOVERNMENT 
INTENDS TO HANDLE THE PROBLEMS 
CREATED BY THE SCRAPPING OF THE TEN P. 
TAX RATE IT 
NOT MEAN WE WILL 
HEAR AT EVERY DETAIL OR THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF WHAT MONEY IS PAID 
BUT WE WILL GET AN ANNOUNCEMENT 
FROM THE TREASURER VERY SOON 
ALMOST CERTAINLY THIS WEEK 
SPELLING OUT HOW THEY WILL GO ABOUT 
COMPENSATING THOSE PEOPLE THEY 
BELIEVE DESERVE AND CAN GET 
COMPENSATION FOR WHAT ALL IN 
GOVERNMENT NOW BELIEVE WAS A 
TERRIBLE POLITICAL ERROR 
OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT MAJOR 
EARTHQUAKE HAS STRUCK SOUTH WEST 
CHINA CHINA THE DEATH TOLL IS ALREADY AT NINE THOUSAND 
AND IT IS EXPECTED TO RISE 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON NEWS THEY 
SPEND ELEVEN BILLION A YEAR BUT IS 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH STARTING TO 
SQUEEZE TOURISTS OUT OF THE 
CAPITAL CAPITAL PLUS MEET THE MUMS CAMPAIGNING TO 
BREAST FEED IN PUBLIC AND THE 
BUSINESSES WHO ARE NOT KEEN 
A COURT IN BELFAST HAS HEARD 
GRAPHIC EVIDENCE IN THE CASE OF THE 
LOYALIST MICHAEL STONE WHO 
ATTACKED THE NORTHERN IRELAND 
ASSEMBLY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE PROSECUTION 
ALLEGES THAT HE PLANNED TO KILL THE 
SINN FEIN LEADERS GERRY ADAMS AND 
MARTIN MCGUINNESS MICHAEL STONE 
HAS SAID HIS ACTIONS WERE MEANT TO 
BE PERFORMANCE ART 
MICHAEL STONE WAS STOPPED AT THE 
DOORS TO STORMONT BY TWO SECURITY 
GUARDS HE THREATENED TO SHOOT ONE 
OF THEM SUSAN PORTER SHE TOOK THE 
GUN WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN HER LEFT 
HAND AFTER KNEEING HIM IN THE 
GROIN PROSECUTION COUNSEL OPENING 
THE CASE SAID MICHAEL STONE TOLD 
POLICE HE HAD PLANNED TO USE 
IMPROVISED BOMBS TO MAKE SMOKE AND 
CAUSED A DIVERSION IN THE ENTRANCE 
HALL AND THE ASSEMBLY CHAMBER THEN 
IN THE CONFUSION MICHAEL STONE 
TOLD POLICE HE PLANNED TO USE 
CLOSE QUARTER TACTICS TO SLIT THE 
THROATS OF GEMMA ADAMS GERRY 
ADAMS AND MARTIN MCGUINNESS WHO HE 
REPEATEDLY DESCRIBED AS WAR 
CRIMINALS WHEN DETAINED MICHAEL 
STONE KEPT SHOUTING NO SURRENDER 
AND MADE REPEATED REFERENCES TO IAN 
PAISLEY AND SINN FEIN LATELY 
DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS A DISSIDENT 
LOYALIST FREELANCE ACTING ALONE 
HE ALSO TOLD POLICE THAT IAN 
PAISLEY HAD TOLD HIM ALL HIS LIFE 
THAT IT WAS A WAR THAT WAS WHY HE 
HAD ACTED MICHAEL STONE HAD SERVED 
LIFE SENTENCES FOR SIX MURDERS 
INCLUDING THREE PEOPLE AT AN I. R. A. 
FUNERAL HE WAS RELEASED UNDER THE 
GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT BUT HIS 
LICENCE WAS REVOKED AFTER THE 
EVENTS AT STORMONT AT EARLIER 
HEARINGS IN THIS CASE MICHAEL 
STONE DESCRIBED HIS ACTIONS AS 
PERFORMANCE ART TODAY CROWN 
COUNSEL SAID THAT HIS ATTEMPT TO 
ASSASSINATE GERRY ADAMS AND MARTIN 
MCGUINNESS FAILED ONLY BECAUSE OF 
THE BRAVERY OF THE SECURITY STAFF 
AT THE REVOLVING DOOR THE CASE IS 
EXPECTED TO LAST SEVERAL WEEKS 
IT IS AN ISSUE WHERE POLITICS AND 
MORALITY SOMETIMES CLASH HEAD ON 
TODAY M. P.'S BEGAN TO DEBATE A BILL 
THAT WILL TRY TO SET NEW STANDARDS 
ON THE USE OF HUMAN EMBRYOS 
OPPONENTS SAY ALLOWING THE CREATION 
OF HYBRID EMBRYOS USING BOTH HUMAN 
AND ANIMAL MATERIAL IS ONE STEP 
AWAY FROM FRANKENSTEIN SCIENCE BUT 
SOME EXPERTS POINT TO THE POTENTIAL 
FOR CURING GENETIC CONDITIONS OUR 
MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT IS HERE 
IT IS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE M. P.'S 
LAST REVIEWED THE LAW ON FERTILITY 
THE SCOPE OF THE BILL IS HUGE 
DEALING WITH I. V. F. EMBRYO RESEARCH 
AND THE SOCIAL CONTEXT IN WHICH 
FERTILITY TREATMENT IS ALLOWED M. P.'S 
ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF DEBATE 
THESE ARE LIVE PICTURES FROM THE 
FLOOR OF THE COMMONS OPENING THE 
DEBATE THE HEALTH SECRETARY ALAN 
JOHNSON SAID MINISTERS SUPPORTED 
NEW FORMS OF EMBRYO RESEARCH AS 
LONG AS IT WAS PROPERLY REGULATED 
STEM CELL RESEARCH HAS ENORMOUS 
POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP NEW CURES FOR 
DEGENERATIVE AND OTHER LIFE 
THREATENING DISEASES IT BRINGS 
HOPE TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
SUFFERERS AND THEIR FAMILIES THIS 
GOVERNMENT BELIEVES WE SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SUCH RESEARCH 
NEXT WEEK M. P.'S WILL GET A FREE VOTE 
ON FOUR KEY ISSUES THE TIME LIMIT 
FOR ABORTION THE CREATION OF 
HYBRID EMBRYOS SO CALLED SAVIOUR 
SIBLINGS AND THE NEED FOR A FATHER 
IN I. V. F. TREATMENT ABORTION MAY BE 
THE MOST HOTLY ARGUED TOPIC BY M. P.'S 
THIS COMPUTER IMAGE SHOWS WHAT A 
TWENTY WEEK OLD FOETUS LOOKS LIKE THE 
GOVERNMENT AND LEADING MEDICAL 
ORGANISATIONS SAY THE ABORTION 
LIMIT SHOULD REMAIN UNCHANGED AT TWENTY FOUR 
WEEKS BUT ONE AMENDMENT WOULD CUT 
THE TIME LIMIT TO TWENTY WEEKS THE 
NEXT ISSUE IS SO CALLED HYBRID 
EMBRYOS CREATED BY MIXING HUMAN 
AND ANIMAL D. N. A. THEY WOULD BE 
DESTROYED WHEN STILL SMALLER THAN 
PINHEAD PATIENT GROUPS AND 
SCIENTISTS JOINED FORCES OUTSIDE 
THE COMMONS TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT 
FOR THE RESEARCH WHICH THEY THINK 
COULD LEAD TO BETTER 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE THEY THEY ARE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE U. K. WITH 
PARKINSON'S WHO COULD POTENTIALLY 
BENEFIT FROM THIS AND OTHER AREAS 
OF RESEARCH IT IS VITAL THAT WE 
KEEP ALL AVENUES OPEN 
ANOTHER KEY 
ISSUE ON WHICH M. P.'S WILL GET A FREE 
VOTE IS SAVIOUR SIBLINGS BY 
SELECTING COMPATIBLE EMBRYOS DURING 
I. V. F. IT MEANS UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD 
CAN NOW BE TAKEN FROM A NEWBORN 
BABY AND USED TO TREAT BASIC 
SIBLING IT WORKED FOR YOUNG 
CHARLIE WHITAKER CURED BY HIS 
INFANT BROTHER JAMIE THIS 
TREATMENT IS NOW ILLEGAL BUT M. P.'S 
COULD DECIDE TO BAN IT THE LAST 
FREE VOTE ISSUE SURROUNDS FATHERS 
THE CURRENT LAW SAYS I. V. F. CLINICS 
MUST CONSIDER THE NEED FOR A FATHER 
WHEN PEOPLE SEEK I. V. F. THE NEW LAW 
WOULD TALK INSTEAD OF SUPPORTED 
PARENTING SOME SEE THAT AS 
UNDERMINING THE ROLE OF THE 
TRADITIONAL FAMILY 
ONLY TWO PER CENT OF I. V. F. 
TREATMENTS ARE TO SINGLE PARENTS OR 
GAY COUPLES THE PROBLEM HERE IS 
BEYOND THAT EVEN PUTTING THOSE 
COUPLES ON ONE SIDE YOU END UP 
WITH US SENDING A POWERFUL SIGNAL 
THAT BY TAKING THIS OUT FOR EVERY 
OTHER MEMBER INVOLVED IN THIS 
FATHERS NO LONGER MATTER 
THERE ARE 
HUGE SOCIAL AND ETHICAL QUESTIONS 
HERE WHAT STATUS SHOULD AN EMBRYO 
HAVE COME AND HOW DO YOU BALANCE 
THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO SEEK EITHER 
AN ABORTION OR FERTILITY TREATMENT 
WITH THOSE OF A DEVELOPING FOETUS 
NOW IF YOU'RE A FAN OF SEX AND THE 
CITY YOU'RE FOUR YEAR WAIT FOR THE 
BIG SCREEN VERSION OF THE T. V. SERIES 
IS OVER ITS STYLISH STARS ARE IN 
LONDON FOR THE WORLD PREMIERE OF 
THAT WHAT HE ANTICIPATED FILM ALL 
EYES WILL BE ON WHAT THE 
FASHIONABLE FOURSOME WILL WEAR FOR 
THEIR BIG NIGHT RAZIA IQBAL IS ON 
THE RED CARPET IN LEICESTER SQUARE 
WHERE THERE IS A BIG AND NOISY 
CROWD CROWD THERE IS A HUGE CROWD HERE HUGE 
EXCITEMENT THE SEX AND THE CITY 
JUGGERNAUT HAS PULLED INTO TOWN 
FOR A SHOW SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED 
WITH NEW YORK THERE IS CURIOSITY 
ABOUT WHY THE WORLD PREMIERE IS IN 
LONDON THE FOUR WOMEN ALL EYES 
ARE ON THEIR CLOTHES THEY LOOK 
AMAZING THEY WILL BE STAYING NOT 
TO REVEAL DETAILS OF THE PLOT 
BECAUSE THE FILM WILL NOT OPEN 
PROPERLY AND GET ITS PREMIERE IN 
NEW YORK UNTIL THE END OF THE MONTH 
SASHAYED FROM SMALL SCREEN TO BID 
ULTIMATE SINGLE DOUBT CARRIE 
BRADSHAW WILL BE MARRIED TO JOHN 
JAMES PRESTON COME FOR 
HOW IS THIS 
PLACE EVEN AVAILABLE 
AND SO 
CARRIE BRADSHAW OR FOR SOME AS 
ICONIC A LITERARY FIGURE AS 
ELIZABETH BENNET IS NO LONGER THE 
SINGLETON WHICH WAS SUCH A BIG PART 
OF HER IDENTITY IN THE SUCCESSFUL 
T. V. SERIES 
SHALL WE GET YOU A 
DIAMOND 
AND NO A BID CLOSET LOVE DIAMOND LOVE IN FASHION AS MUCH AS MEN WAS WHAT 
IDENTIFIED THESE MEN 
THESE HAVE 
ALWAYS BEEN LABELLED LABEL 
CONSCIOUS WOMEN ARE THEY 
COMPLICATED SOME TIMES BUT THEY 
SPEAK TO A VERY SPECIFIC SEGMENT OF 
A POPULATION IN NEW YORK WE DON'T 
PRETEND THAT IT SHOWS THE TRUE 
COLOURS OF ALL OF NEW YORK AND ALL 
THE PEOPLE WHO SIT IN THE ECONOMIC 
STRATA BECAUSE IT DOESN'T 
I WAS RUNNING AROUND YORK THINKING 
I'M FINALLY GETTING MY HAPPY ENDING 
WE WILL HAVE TO WATCH THE FILM TO 
SEE IF SHE DOES GET THAT HAPPY 
ENDING BUT MORE PRESSING FOR THE 
CAST TODAY IS THE ISSUE OF THE FILM 
GETTING ITS PREMIERE IN LONDON 
INSTEAD OF MANHATTAN SO CENTRAL TO 
THE STORY 
WE MADE IT IN NEW YORK 
AND WE ARE VERY NEW YORK BASED 
THREE OF US LIVE IN NEW YORK MOST 
OF THE CREW IS IN NEW YORK WE 
SHOOT IN NEW YORK BUT I THINK THAT 
IT IS ALSO NOT JUST A SHOW ABOUT 
NEW YORK ANY MORE IN THE FOUR 
YEARS WE WERE NOT MAKING THE SHOW 
IT WENT ALL OVER THE WORLD 
FOR A 
SERIES THAT BEGAN AS A PILOT ON THE 
DOWN FAIRLY OBSCURE CABLE CHANNEL 
H. B. O. SEX AND THE CITY IS A BIG 
SUCCESS STORY WHETHER THE CRITICS 
LOVE IT AS MUCH AS THE FIRST FEW 
SERIES THE BRAND IS ALMOST 
CERTAINLY A CASH COW ITS LEGION OF 
FANS WILL ENSURE THAT 
ALL DAY 
EVERY DAY 
APART FROM THE FANS THE 
PRESS ARE HERE IN FORCE MANY OF 
THEM ARE CELEBRATING WHAT THIS SHOW 
IS REALLY ABOUT SPORTING THEIR 
FOUR INCH HEELS AND THAT IS JUST 
THE MEN 
NOW GETTING YOUR CAR PLANT CAN 
MAKE ANYONE'S BLOOD BOIL BUT MOST 
OF US EVENTUALLY PAY THE FINE 
GETTING YOUR CAR CLAMPED BUT WHEN 
THE CLAMPERS TURNED UP ON IAN 
TAYLOR'S DRIVEWAY HE DECIDED TO 
TAKE DRASTIC ACTION AND REACH FOR 
HIS TOOLBOX 
CUTTING A SWATHE THROUGH PARKING 
BUREAUCRACY OR SIMPLY CHEATING THE 
SYSTEM WHEN HIS STEPSON'S FORD 
FIESTA WAS CLAMPED IAN TAYLOR 
DEMONSTRATING HIS TECHNIQUE HERE 
CUT THE CAR IN HALF RATHER THAN 
PAY A FINE AND ROAD TAX TOTALLING 
TWO HUNDRED 
THE RELEASE FEE WOULD HAVE TWO HUNDRED BEEN FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AS THE CAR 
IS WORTH MORE THAN THAT L. CUT IT 
IN HALF BECAUSE THE WAY THE 
CAMPAIGN UNIT WOULD PICK IT UP IS 
BY ALL FOUR WHEELS TO AVOID 
DAMAGING THE VEHICLE BY CUTTING IT 
IN HALF THEY COULD NOT PICK IT UP 
I DID NOT INTERFERE WITH THE WHEEL 
CLAMP 
UNABLE TO REMOVE 
THE CAR OF CLAMP THE CLAMPERS REMOVED INSTEAD WITH 
NO FINE ISSUED THE CAMP WAS 
REMOVED INSTEAD IN HAD ALL THE 
DOCUMENTATION TO ALLOW IT TO BE 
LEGALLY PART OFF ROAD BUT HERE IS 
THE PROPER DO THAN READ VIENNA 
ADMITS THAT THE CAR WAS PARKED OVER 
THE BOUNDARY BUT HE SAYS NOT 
ENOUGH FOR IT TO BE REASONABLE FOR 
IT TO BE CLAMPED BUT THIS PHOTO 
WAS TAKEN BY THE PARKING COMPANY 
AND THEY STAND BY THEIR DECISION 
HIS VEHICLE WAS ALBEIT PARTIALLY 
ON THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY AND THAT IS 
WHY WE ENFORCED AGAINST IT HIS 
REACTION IS HIS OWN BUSINESS BUT 
MOST REASONABLE DRIVERS WOULD BE 
ASTONISHED THAT SOMEBODY WENT TO 
SUCH LENGTHS TO PROVE POINT ABOUT 
A CAMP 
THIS AFTERNOON IT WAS 
TAKEN AWAY TO BE SCRAPPED AS A CAR 
TWO PARTS IT ACHIEVED FORTY MORE 
THAN THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE 
LET'S GET THE WEATHER NOW 
ANOTHER GOOD LOOKING THERE FOR MANY 
OF US SOME OF US HAD THAT CLOUD 
BUT A GOOD LOOKING EVENING THERE 
WILL BE CLEAR SPELLS AS WE GO ALONG 
BUT WE HAVE HAD SOME LOVELY 
SUNSHINE ACROSS A GOOD PART OF THE 
BRITISH ISLES EXCEPT SOME STUBBORN 
CLOUD THAT HAD AN EFFECT ON YOUR 
DAY ACROSS THE NORTH EAST PART OF 
BRITAIN COMPARE THOSE TEMPERATURES 
TO FURTHER SOUTH WHERE WE HAD THE 
SUNSHINE QUITE A CONTRAST THAT 
CLOUD WILL NOT COMPLETELY GO AWAY 
BECAUSE OF THE FLOW IN OF BE CHILLY 
NORTH SEA OTHERWISE IT IS A QUIET 
NIGHT A FEW SHOWERS OVER SCOTLAND 
TEMPERATURES DROPPING AWAY BY 
MORNING SOME COLLECT AIR IN NORTH 
PARTS OF BRITAIN SOME COOLER AIR 
THE CLOUD WILL SLOWLY TURN BACK TO 
THE COACH BY THE AFTERNOON IT IS

FINE LOOKING DAY IN CARDIFF A 
GOOD LOOKING DAY FOR BELFAST AND 
MUCH OF NORTHERN IRELAND THERE IS

THEY ARE NOT DOING AS WELL STILL 
SOME OF THAT CLOUD MIGHT GIVE US 
ONLY THIRTEEN FOR NEWCASTLE THE MIDLANDS
