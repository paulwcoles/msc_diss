THIS IS B. B. C. WORLD NEWS TODAY WITH 
ME ZEINAB BADAWI IN CHINA THE 
RESCUE EFFORT IS A RACE AGAINST 
TIME WHICH IS WHAT PRESIDENT HU 
JINTAO SAID AS HE VISITED THE 
REGION DEVASTATED BY THE EARTHQUAKE 
THERE HAVE BEEN SEEMINGLY 
MIRACULOUS RESCUES BUT THE 
AFTERSHOCKS HAVE CAUSED LANDSLIDES 
AND BLOCKED ROADS AS PRESIDENT HU 
COMFORTS THE SURVIVORS WE ASKED IF 
HE AND HIS GOVERNMENT HAVE BOOSTED 
THEIR LEADERSHIP CREDENTIALS BY THE 
HANDLING OF THE CRISIS 
THE ZIMBABWE OPPOSITION LEADER SAYS 
HE WILL CONTEST THE SECOND ROUND OF 
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION EVEN 
THOUGH THE VOTE WAS ILLEGAL THE 
DATE IS SET FOR LATE JUNE 
HUNDREDS OF SUSPECTED ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS ROUNDED UP IN ITALY AS 
THE NEW RIGHT WING GOVERNMENT PLANS 
LAWS TO CLAMPDOWN ON ILLEGAL 
MIGRANTS WILL THIS LEAD TO MORE 
ANTI FOREIGNER FEELINGS 
A SPECIAL REPORT FROM THE BREAKAWAY 
REGION IN GEORGIA AND WHY IT COULD 
LEAD TO ADD ALL OUT WAR BETWEEN 
RUSSIA AND GEORGIA 
WELCOME THERE IS INCREASING 
PESSIMISM THAT FINDING SURVIVORS 
FROM THE CHINESE EARTHQUAKE THAT 
STRUCK THE SOUTH WESTERN PROVINCE 
OF SICHUAN PESSIMISM ABOUT 
RESCUE EFFORTS ARE BEING HAMPERED 
BY STRONG AFTERSHOCKS WHICH HAVE 
CLOSED ROADS AND COMMUNICATIONS 
THE PRESIDENT TODAY VISITED THE 
DEVASTATED AREAS AND TRY TO COMFORT 
THE VICTIMS IN A MOMENT WE WILL 
DISCUSS HOW THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP 
HAVE HANDLED THE CRISIS WITH A 
FORMER PRO DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST AT 
THE TEMMERMAN SQUARE PROTESTS 
FIRST JAMES REYNOLDS HAS THE LATEST 
FROM NEAR THE EPICENTRE THE 
TIANANMEN SQUARE 
THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE IS THE 
SILENCE THIS PLACE HAS GONE QUIET 
WHEN A WHOLE TOWN HAS BEEN 
DESTROYED WED YOU EVEN START TO 
LOOK WHERE DO YOU THIS MAN 
STANDS ON THE REMAINS OF HIS HOUSE 
AND CALLED OUT FOR HIS WIFE IT 
SEEMS INCREDIBLE THAT ANYONE MIGHT 
STILL BE ALIVE UNDER ALL THIS BUT 
ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE LOCAL 
TRANSPORT OFFERS RESCUERS HAVE 
FOUND A SURVIVOR THE SURVIVORS 
TRAPPED UNDER THE CONCRETE 
SURVIVOR IS GIVE ME TWO MORE 
BOTTLES OF WATER HE SAYS WE NEED 
SOMETHING TO LIFT THE CONCRETE TO 
GET HIS LEGS OUT SAID THE RESCUE 
HER NOW ALL HE CAN DO IS WAIT 
THE RESCUE HER HE HAS NOT BEEN 
TOLD HIS MOTHER DIED IN THE 
EARTHQUAKE IN THE EARLY EVENING 
WE COME ACROSS MORE RESCUERS THEY 
ARE LOOKING THROUGH THE OFFICES OF 
A POWER COMPANY RESCUERS HAVE 
FOUND TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL 
ALIVE BUT TRAPPED INSIDE THE RUBBLE 
THEY HAVE SPOKEN TO A WOMAN TRAPPED 
RIGHT AND ABOUT WITH A CHILD WE 
HAVE HEARD THEM SAY TO THE WOMAN 
DON'T WORRY WE WILL GET YOU OUT 
THEY REMOVE DEBRIS DIP BIT BY BIT 
AN HOUR GOES BY THEN THE WOMAN HAS 
BROUGHT OUT SHE PUTS HER ARM OVER 
HER EYES TO SHIELD HERSELF FROM THE 
LIGHT LIGHT RESCUERS CARRIED HER THROUGH THE 
WRECKAGE A MEDIC GIVES US SOME 
GLUCOSE GIVES HER THEN SHE HAS 
CARRIED A HOSPITAL AND I SERIOUSLY 
INJURED SHE ASKS I AM I THERE 
MAY BE MORE SURVIVORS LIKE HER 
STILL UNDER THE WRECKAGE IF ANYONE 
ELSE'S PULLED OUT ALIVE THEY WILL 
SEE THAT THEIR TOWN NO LONGER 
EXISTS EXISTS AS YOU MENTION PRESIDENT HU JINTAO 
HAS GONE TO SICHUAN TODAY FOLLOWING 
ON THE HEELS OF HIS PRESIDENT WEN 
JIAOBAO WHO HAS BEEN IN THE 
REGIONAL WEEK THEY ARE A HIGH 
PROFILE PREV VISIT PRESENCE AND 
THEIR HANDS ON APPROACH HAS BEEN 
CONTRASTED FAVOURABLY WITH SOME 
OBSERVERS TO GEORGE BUSH'S RESPONSE 
TO HURRICANE KATRINA IN YOUR 
AUDIENCE THREE MACRO THREE YEARS 
AGO AGO THE POLITICAL COST OF MS. MAM LOT 
MISHANDLING THE MANAGEMENT OF A 
DISASTER CAN BE HUGE THE PRESIDENT 
ROLLED UP HIS SLEEVES AND PORED 
OVER MAPS EN ROUTE TO THE 
DEVASTATED REGION THE PRIME 
MINISTER WEN JIAOBAO BOARDED A 
PLANE TO SICHUAN JUST TWO HOURS 
AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE THAT HAS 
REMAINED THERE ALL WEEK AND HAS 
TELEVISION PICTURES SHOW HIM 
COMFORTING VICTIMS MANY OF THEM 
CHILDREN STYLING HIMSELF AT TIMES 
AS A GRANDFATHER HE TOLD HIS GIRL 
DON'T CRY THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE 
CARE OF YOU STATE MEDIA COVERAGE 
HAS BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT BEIJING 
SEEMS TO BE OPEN ABOUT THE SCALE OF 
THE DISASTER AND THE EVER RISING 
CASUALTY FIGURES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN AN 
EARTHQUAKE TOOK CHINA KILLING A 
QUARTER OF A MILLION IT TOOK THREE 
YEARS BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES 
CONFIRMED THE DEATH TOLL 
BEIJING HAS ALSO ACCEPTED EIGHT AND 
EXPERTS FROM THAILAND DESPITE THE 
TENSION SINCE THE ISLAND SPLIT FROM 
CHINA ALMOST SIXTY YEARS AGO 
ACCEPTED AID NATIONALIST SENTIMENT 
HAS BEEN PUT ASIDE WITH EARTHQUAKE 
SPECIALISTS BEING WELCOMED FROM 
JAPAN POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC 
BENEFITS COULD EMERGE FROM THE 
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE BUT PRESIDENT HU AND 
PREMIER WEN JIAOBAO NEED TO PRESENT 
THEMSELVES AS STRONG LEADERS IN 
TOUCH WITH THE SUFFERING OF THE 
COMMON PEOPLE IF THEY ARE TO AVOID 
POPULAR FRUSTRATION AT THE 
AUTHORITIES' HANDLING 
IS THEIR HIGH PROFILE A STRATEGIC 
CALCULATION OR A SINCERE REFLECTION 
OF THEIR GENUINE CONCERNS HERE TO 
DISCUSS IT IS THE LONDON BASED 
CHINESE AUTHOR DYKE DIANE WEI 
LIANG AMONG THE TIANANMEN SQUARE 
PROTESTERS IN BEIJING NINETEEN YEARS AGO 
ARE THEY SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ARE 
JUST WORRIED THAT THINGS MIGHT TURN 
AGAINST THEM IF THEY DON'T SHOW 
THEIR HANDS ON 
I BELIEVE THEY ARE 
SINCERE AND THEY ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT PEOPLE AND CONCERNED ABOUT 
THIS DEVASTATION THAT HAS HAPPENED 
IN SICHUAN PROVINCE BUT I THINK 
AS ANYTHING IN CHINA IT IS A 
HIGHLY IT IS HIGHLY ORCHESTRATED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT AND A GREAT 
SHOWCASE FOR THEM TO DEMONSTRATE 
THEIR COMPETENCE THEIR ENGAGEMENT 
WITH THE WORLD IN HUMANITARIAN 
RESCUE EFFORTS PARTICULARLY AFTER 
WHAT HAPPENED IN TIBET 
THEY ARE 
VERY MUCH COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER 
DON'T THEY PRESIDENT HU IS MORE 
STERN AND THE PREMIER WEN JIAOBAO 
STYLES HIMSELF AS A MAN OF THE 
PEOPLE ADD AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN 
TERMS OF MEDIA COVERAGE ARE 
THEY 
THEY MAKE 
A GOOD TEAM AND ARE THEY A NEW GENERATION OF LEADERS WHO 
HAVE COME THROUGH AFTER TIANANMEN 
THEY REPRESENT MODERNISATION OF A 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT COLOUR IN SOME 
SENSE 
THEY LACK THE KIND OF SENSE LEADERS WHOSE CENTRE IN THE TANKS 
IN TIANANMEN SQUARE WHEN YOU WERE 
PROTESTING ALL THOSE YEARS AGO 
THEY ARE NOT THE KIND OF LEADERS 
WHO SENT HIM 
NO NEXT GENERATION 
HAVE THEY GENUINELY UP AND UP THE 
MEDIA THERE IS WALL TO WALL 
COVERAGE OPENED UP THE MEDIA IS 
IT JUST THE SAME AS THE STATE 
PROPAGANDA 
FATHERS EARTHQUAKE PROPAGANDA CRISIS THERE IS MORE COVERAGE AND 
THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE OPEN FOR 
THIS IT IS A NATURAL DISASTER IT 
IS A DISASTER THAT HAD NOTHING TO 
DO WITH THE GOVERNMENT IT WAS NOT 
CAUSED BY ANY POLITICAL ISSUE THIS 
IS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT TO OPEN UP AND 
DEMONSTRATES TO THE CHINESE PEOPLE 
AND THE WORLD THAT THEY ARE 
CONCERNED WITH CHINESE WELFARE AND 
THEY ARE VERY COMPETENT AND 
EFFICIENT AS RESCUING EFFORTS 
HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS AT RESCUING 
HOW WORRIED OF THE LEADERSHIP THAT 
ANY FRUSTRATION WITH THE RESCUE 
EFFORT MIGHT BEGIN TO POPULAR 
DISCONTENT WITH CORRUPTION AND THE 
GROWING SOCIAL DIVIDES THAT WE HAVE 
IN CHINA HOW WORRIED ARE SOME 
OF THE WORST AFFECTED AREAS WERE IN 
THE LESS WELL OFF PARTS 
I WOULD 
GUESS THEY ARE CERTAINLY CONCERNED 
IF YOU RECALL THE PAST CHINESE NEW 
YEAR WHEN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE 
STRANDED IN TRAIN STATIONS BECAUSE 
OF BLIZZARD CONDITIONS THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS NOT VERY SWIFT TO 
RESOLVE THAT CRISIS IT CAUSED 
WIDESPREAD DISCONTENT AMONG THE 
CHINESE CITIZENS I THINK THAT THIS 
TIME THEY HAVE TAKEN A VERY SWIFT 
AND EFFICIENT ADVERTS AT RESPONDING 
QUICKLY AND RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY 
TO THE CRISIS A FISH AND EFFORT 
YOUR PARENTS WERE CAUGHT UP IN THE 
CULTURAL REVOLUTION WHEN YOU WERE A 
GIRL AND WERE KEPT IN LABOUR CAMPS 
IN THIS PART WHERE THE EARTHQUAKE 
ACTUALLY STRUCK AS A CHINESE 
PERSON IT MUST BE EXTREMELY 
UPSETTING TO YOU TO SEE ALL OF 
THESE IMAGES 
ABSOLUTELY IT IS 
UPSETTING TO SEE THE DEVASTATION 
THAT WAS CAUSED TO THE PEOPLE WHO 
LIVE IN SICHUAN PROVINCE AND TO SEE 
PARTICULARLY THE DEATH TOLL IN 
SCHOOLS IN THE AREA I REMEMBER 
GROWING UP AND THAT PART OF THE 
COUNTRY AND THE LABOUR CAMP WAS NOT 
TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE EPICENTRE IT 
IS A BEAUTIFUL REGION FULL OF 
NATURAL BEAUTY AND EXTREMELY KIND 
AND LOVELY PEOPLE IT IS VERY 
DEVASTATING 
DIANE WEI LIANG THANK DEVASTATING YOU FOR TALKING TO US 
THANK YOU 
IN BURMA THE AUTHORITIES SAY THEY 
BELIEVE SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED BY CYCLONE NARGIS WHICH 
STRUCK TWO WEEKS AGO WELL TO IN 
THE GOVERNMENT CAMP THE PRIME 
MINISTER TODAY CLAIMS THE EMERGENCY 
RELIEF PHASE WAS OVER AND THE 
REBUILDING WAS BEGINNING MEDIA 
REPORTS FROM THE WORST AFFECTED 
AREA THE IRRAWADDY DELTA SAY 
THERE IS LITTLE SIGN OF HELP FROM A 
GOVERNMENT STILL RELUCTANT TO 
ACCEPT OUTSIDE AID 
AFTER ALMOST TWO MONTHS OF 
POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY A DATE HAS 
FINALLY BEEN SET BY SECOND RUN OFF 
IN ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
HAS PREDICTED HE WILL WIN THE 
ELECTION AGAIN ON JUNE THE TWENTY SEVENTH 
BUT ONLY IF OBSERVERS FROM OTHER 
AFRICAN NATIONS CAN GUARANTEE 
SECURITY FOR THE VOTE AND AFRICA 
CORRESPONDENT ORLA GUERIN HAS BEEN 
TALKING TO MR. AS TSVANGIRAI AND 
SENDS THIS REPORT FROM JOHANNESBURG 
IN SOUTH AFRICA 
A WARM WELCOME FOR A LEADER FACING 
THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI MAKING A BRIEF 
APPEARANCE IN BELFAST ON THE EVE OF 
RETURNING TO HIS HOMELAND THE 
HOPES OF MANY ARE RESTING ON HIS 
SHOULDERS HIS MESSAGE HERE THAT 
THE DOWNFALL OF THE MUGABE 
DICTATORSHIP IS INEVITABLE IN AN 
EARLIER B. B. C. INTERVIEW HE SAID THE 
RULING PARTY IS MAKING OVERTURES 
ABOUT A NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT 
WILL THE CONFLICT ENDED BY AN ACT 
AS A NEGOTIATING TABLE WE'RE OPEN 
BUT IT IS NOT A PRIORITY 
ADD A 
REACHING OUT TO YOU 
YES BUT WE 
HAVE SAID YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE 
TO US YOU HAVE TO GIVE US THE 
SINCERITY THAT YOU 
ARE SERIOUS ARE THEY REACHING 
THE M. D. C. HAVE NO 
PRECONDITION OF THEIR PRESIDENT 
MUGABE YOU ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT 
HIM AS PART OF A NATIONAL UNITY 
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT WE ARE SAYING NO PRECONDITIONS 
EQUALLY SO WE ARE ALSO SAY WE ARE 
NOT PUTTING ANY PRECONDITIONS 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S 
FUTURE THAT IS ALL 
A COUNTRY 
WHERE OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS ARE NOT 
SAFE EVEN ON SACRED GROUND THIS 
GROUP TAKEN FROM A CHURCH BY 
POLICE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY WERE 
DUMPED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 
IT IS IN THE REMOTE RURAL AREAS 
THAT THE RULING PARTY IS DOING ITS 
WORST M. D. C. VOTERS ARE BEING BURNED 
OUT AND STARVED OUT THEIR MEAGRE 
FOOD SUPPLIES ARE TORCHED PAY BACK 
FOR NOT SUPPORTING ROBERT MUGABE IN 
THE FIRST ROUND TODAY HE CALLED 
THAT DEFEAT DISASTROUS HE DOESN'T 
INTEND TO LOSE AGAIN THIS IS WHAT 
CAN HAPPEN TO OPPOSITION ACTIVISTS 
NELSON WAS ATTACKED WITH A 
SCREWDRIVER NOT LONG AFTER HIS 
PICTURES WERE TAKEN HE SLIPPED 
AWAY THESE PICTURES HE IS ONE 
OF MORE THAN THIRTY KILLED SO FAR 
ACCORDING TO THE M. D. C. SOME WERE 
BURIED UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS 
SUCH IS THE FEAR 
THIS IS WHAT AWAITS MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HE IS DUE BACK IN 
ZIMBABWE TOMORROW AFTER A LONG 
ABSENCE TOO LONG SOME OF HIS 
SUPPORTERS SAY HE PLANS TO START 
CAMPAIGNING IMMEDIATELY TO RALLY 
THE PARTY FAITHFUL THE BIG UNKNOWN 
IS JUST HOW MANY WILL HAVE BEEN 
SCARED AWAY 
TODAY PRESIDENT MUGABE 
ACKNOWLEDGED HIS PARTY'S 
UNPRECEDENTED ELECTION LAST FOR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY WE 
HAVE LOST OUR MAJORITY IN 
PARLIAMENT ALTHOUGH WE RETAINED IT 
IN THE SENATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
ELECTION RESULTS INDICATE WE MAY 
HAVE JUST AN EDGE OVER THE 
OPPOSITION ALTHOUGH THE 
PRESIDENTIAL RESULTS DID NOT YIELD 
AN OUTRIGHT WINNER IT WAS ALSO 
IT WAS INDEED DISASTROUS 
WE ARE 
JOINED FROM WASHINGTON BY TOM 
MCDONALD THE U. S. AMBASSADOR TO 
ZIMBABWE FROM NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN TO TWO THOUSAND ONE HE MET 
PRESIDENT MUGABE MANY TIMES 
AMBASSADOR A RARE ADMISSION OF 
WEAKNESS DO YOU READ ANY 
SIGNIFICANCE 
THAT HE'S A VERY CLEVER FELLOW 
AND SO 
A RARE ADMISSION OF 
WEAKNESS FROM PRESIDENT ROBERT 
MUGABE DO YOU READ ANY 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT THAT 
HE'S A 
VERY CLEVER FELLOW IT REMINDS ME 
WHEN HE LOST HIS FIRST ELECTION IN 
FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND THE FIRST ELECTION 
HE HAD LOST FOLLOWING HIS TAKING 
POWER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY 
THIS IS MUCH MORE 
EXTREME THIS LOSS DO YOU THINK 
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY PERHAPS 
SENIOR ZANU P. F. OFFICIALS MIGHT BE 
SAYING TO HIM RECONSIDER YOUR 
POSITION MR. PRESIDENT WOULD HE 
STAND ASIDE 
HE'S CONSULTING AND 
TALKING ABOUT THE VARIOUS GROUP 
WITHIN THE ZANU P. F. PARTY HE KNOWS 
WHERE ALL THE BODIES ARE BURIED HE 
KEEPS VERY TIGHT CONTROL EVERY 
YEAR THERE WOULD BE A EXTRAORDINARY 
CONGRESS IN DECEMBER OF EVERY YEAR 
I WAS THERE AND THERE WOULD BE 
TALK MUGABE WOULD BE PUSHED ASIDE 
SOMEHOW BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED YES 
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE W. O. I. NOT COUNT 
ON THIS THIS I WOULD NOT COUNT 
ON THIS THIS MAN IS A SURVIVOR 
HE'S SMART AND EVIL AND WILL DO 
WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO TO STAY IN 
POWER 
DO YOU THINK IT WAS RIGHT POWER FOR MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TO SAY HE 
WILL CONTEST THE SECOND ROUND I I DON'T THINK HE HAS ANY CHOICE 
OTHERWISE THE TRAIN LEAVES THE 
STATION LEAVES WITHOUT HIM 
CLEARLY THE CONDITIONS ON THE 
GROUND ARE NOT GOOD AT ALL THE 
CRACKDOWN IS IN FULL REGALIA THIS 
IS A PROCESS BEGUN WITH THE FARM 
EVASIONS IN TWO THOUSAND WITH THE 
ELECTIONS WHEN I WAS THERE AS 
AMBASSADOR AND I SAW FIRST HAND 
THE BEATINGS AND TORTURE THAT WENT 
ON NOW IT'S QUITE EXTREME THEY'RE 
GOING INTO ANGLICAN CHURCHES AND 
DRG DRAGGING PEOPLE OUT THE 
OTHER DAY THEY ATTEMPTED TO CAN HE 
TAIN THE DETAIN THE AMERICAN 
AMBASSADOR THERE HE WAS IMPRESSED 
THE TAN SUDANIANS WERE PART OF THE 
DELEGATIONS GOING FROM HOSPITAL TO 
HOSPITAL TO EXPRESS CONCERN FOR 
THOSE BEATEN AND TORTURED MORGAN MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS CHANGED HIS MIND SO 
MANY TIMES I WON OUTRIGHT AND 
DON'T NEED TO HE IS LOOKING 
INDECISIVE DOESN'T THIS ALLOW 
PRESIDENT MUGABE ALLOW DOESN'T 
THIS ALLOW PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE 
TO SEIZE THE INITIATIVE AGAIN AND 
AGAIN 
I HAVE RESPECT FOR HIM HE AGAIN STOOD UP TO MUCH PRESSURE THUGS 
TRIED TO THROW HIM OUT OF HIS TEN 
STOREY WINDOW WHEN HE WAS HEAD OF 
A LABOUR MOVEMENT THEY PETROL 
BOMBED ONE OF HIS CARS AND KILLED 
A DRIVER OF HIS AT THE TIME HE HAS 
TOED AND FROED SOME ABOUT IT I 
WOULD READ THE FINAL AS HE'S 
COMMITTED I DON'T THINK HE HAS A 
CHOICE THERE CAN'T BE FREE AND 
FAIR ELECTIONS UNDER THIS VIOLENCE 
DO YOU THINK OUTSIDE OBSERVERS MUST 
GO IN OTHERWISE THE VOTE WILL BE A 
WASTE OF TIME AND INTIMIDATION NOT 
FREE AND FAIR AND OUTSIDE 
OBSERVERS NOT FROM SOUTHERN AFRICA 
ALONE WHAT DO YOU THINK THE 
CHANCES OF THAT ARE 
PROBABLY SLIM 
OR NONE WE HAD FOREIGN SERVICE 
OFFICERS OBSERVING IN THE TWO THOUSAND 
ELECTION IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME 
WE WERE INVOLVED IN THE TRAINING OF 
TEN THOUSAND DOMESTIC MONITORS IF WE 
COULD GET A GOOD DELEGATION IN TO 
OBSERVE I WISH HE WOULD CONSIDER 
I WISH THE RULING PARTY WOULD 
CONSIDER EUROPEAN UNION AMERICAN 
OBSERVERS I'M SURE THE BRITS THE 
EUROPEANS THE AMERICANS AND THE 
AUSTRALIANS AND THE JAPANESE WOULD 
WORK WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN 
AUTHORITIES ON PROPER MONITORING 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW IT IS THE MOST RIGHT WING 
GOVERNMENT IN ITALY FOR DECADES 
AND IT INCLUDES KEY MINISTERS ON 
THE ANTI IMMIGRATION LEAGUE THEY 
ARE PLANNING RULES ON TIGHTENING UP 
LAWS ON IMMIGRATION WE HAVE SEEN 
CAMPS OF ROMANIA COMMUNITIES COMING 
UNDER ATTACK AND HUNDREDS OF 
SUSPECTED IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN 
ARRESTED BY POLICE THE POLICE MOVE 
IN THEIR TARGET SUSPECTED 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS LUNS ARRESTED 
AND MANY SWIFTLY DEPORTED IT IS 
PART OF A WIDER CRACKDOWN 
HUNDREDS HUNDREDS AIMED AS TACKLING CRIME FOR WHICH 
FOREIGNERS ARE ROUTINELY BLAMED 
ALL THE CRIMES INVOLVED ARE IN SOME WAY INVOLVED 
TO THE ISSUE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
HUMAN TRAFFICING CRIMES AND 
EXPLOITATION AND PROSTITUTION AND 
TRAFFICKING AND ROBBERY AND DRUG 
RELATED CRIMES 
COULD ALL THIS BE A 
TASTE OF MORE TO COME ITALY HAS A 
NEW RIGHT WING GOVERNMENT LED BY 
SILVIO BERLUSCONI ELECTED IN NO 
SMALL PART ON A PROMISE TO BE TOUGH 
ON CRIME AND IMMIGRATION THE 
PERCEIVED LINK CLEARLY IMPLIED THE 
COALITION INCLUDES THE ANTI 
IMMIGRATION NORTHERN LEAGUE AND 
THE SMALLER POST FASCIST PARTY 
ALIANZA NATIONALE THE NEW MAYOR OF 
ROME HAS PROMISED TO EXPEL TWENTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE HE MAY HAVE THE POWER TO DO 
SO THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING 
TOUGH NEW LAW SOME FEAR IT MAY 
TARGET ROMANIA PEOPLE THERE'S MORE 
THAN A WHIFF OF FEAR EARLIER THIS 
WEEK A ROMANIA CAMP WAS SET ALIGHT 
AS THE FLAMES BURNED LOCAL PEOPLE 
ARE REPORTED TO HAVE STOOD AND 
APPLAUDED THE ROMANIA HAVE BEEN 
LIVING IN ITALY FOR CENTURIES 
OFTEN IN MAKESHIFT CAMPS BUT SIX 
MONTHS AGO ROMANIA JOINED THE E. U. 
THE BARRIERS CAME DOWN MORE PEOPLE 
FLOODED IN AS E. U. MEMBERS ROMANIAN 
CITIZENS INCLUDING THE TRAVELLING 
ROMANIA COMMUNITY ARE ENTITLED TO 
MOVE FREELY ACROSS ALL STATES 
SIGNED UP TO THE SCHENGEN AGREEMENT 
ONLY PEOPLE WITHOUT PROPER 
DOCUMENTATION OR A THREAT TO PUBLIC 
SECURITY CAN LEGALLY BE DEPORTED 
THERE ARE CONCERNS ITALY'S STRICTER 
BORDER CONTROLS MAY RUN COUNTER TO 
THOSE PROPOSALS 
IN CASE OF 
CRIMINAL CASES THESE PEOPLE SHOULD 
BE DEPORTED I DON'T BELIEVE FOUR HUNDRED 
PEOPLE A LARGE GROUP DEPORTED SO 
FAR BY ITALY TO ROMANIA ALL OF 
THEM WERE CRIMINALS I DON'T 
BELIEVE THIS 
IN OTHER WORDS 
ITALY'S BIG POLICE ROUND UPS COULD 
END UP NETTING THE INNOCENT ALONG 
WITH THE GUILTY TIES BETWEEN 
RUSSIA AND GEORGIA ARE HAVE 
BECOME MORE STRAINED AND HAVE 
THREATENED TO BREAK OUT OUT IN 
CONFLICT OVER THE DISPUTED 
TERRITORY OF ABKHAZIA IT BROKE 
AWAY FROM GEORGIA IN A BLOODY WAR 
IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN RECENT WEEKS RUSSIA HAS 
ANNOUNCED IT'S DEEPENING ITS TIES 
WITH ABKHAZIA 
THIS IS THE ROAD TO NOWHERE IT 
LEADS TO A COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T 
EXIST THE PRODUCT OF A WAR THAT 
ALMOST NO ONE HAS HEARD OF THIS IS 
THE BRIDGE OVER THE I. N. U. INGURI 
RIVER AHEAD IS THE BORDER TO 
ABKHAZIA THIS IS THE ONLY WAY IN 
TO WHAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST 
FORGOTTEN AND ISOLATED CONFLICT 
ZONE IN EUROPE ON THE SHORES OF 
THE BLACK SEA STANDS THE ONCE 
BEAUTIFUL CAPITAL IN THE OLD DAYS 
THIS PLACE TEAMED WITH TOURISTS 
FROM ACROSS THE SOVIET UNION THESE 
DAYS THE ONLY VISITORS ARE THE 
LOCAL CATTLE FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE 
WAR ENDED WERE OF THE CITY STILL 
LIES IN RUINS AND NOW THE TALK IS 
AGAIN OF WAR 
AT THE DEFENCE MINISTRY I'M TAKEN 
TO SEE THE LATEST TROPHY AN 
UNMANNED SPYPLANE I'M TOLD THIS IS 
ONE OF SEVEN THEY HAVE SHOT DOWN IN 
RECENT WEEKS THEY SAY IT IS AABLY 
TAPBTD GEORGIAN PROVOCATION 
GEORGIA HAVE MOVED LARGE NUMBERS OF TROOPS UP TO THE 
BORDER ZONE WE ARE READY FOR 
DIALOGUE BUT FIRST THE GEORGEIANS 
MUST MOVE THEIR FORCES BACK FROM 
THE BORDER AREA LAST MONTH 
ABKHAZIA ALLY RUSSIA BEGAN MOVING 
HUNDREDS OF PARATROOPER INTO THE 
BREAK AWAY REGION MOSCOW SAYS THEY 
ARE HERE TO KEEP THE PEACE BUT 
GEORGIA'S PRESIDENT TOLD ME HE 
BELIEVES RUSSIA IS ATTEMPTING TO 
ILLEGALLY ANNEX ABKHAZIA RECENTLY 
RUSSIA STEPPED UP SUPPORT THEY 
BOMBED GEORGIA IN THIS REGION THEY 
BROUGHT IN TROOPS AND ARE WATCHING 
VERY CAREFULLY WHAT THE REST OF THE 
WORLD WOULD SAY IF THE WORLD DOES 
REACT STRONGLY ENOUGH OR LIMITS IT 
IS TO TOOTHLESS STATEMENTS OR 
GENERAL DECLARATIONS THE SITUATION 
IS NOT GOING TO IMPROVE BY TIZ IT 
WILL GET WORSE 
GEORGIA HAS 
RELEASED THIS VIDEO IT CLAIMS TO 
SHOW A RUSSIAN AIR FORCE JET IN THE 
ACT OF SHOOTING DOWN ONE OF THE 
GEORGIAN ZONES TIBILISI HAS CALLED 
IT AN ACT OF WAR WHILE THE 
POLITICIANS TRADE ACCUSATIONS 
NOTHING IS BEING DONE TO DEAL WITH 
THE BITTER LEGACY OF THE WAR ALL 
DOWN THE SOUTHERN COAST OF ABKHAZIA 
IN EVERY TOWN AND VILLAGE WE HAVE 
BEEN TO WE HAVE FOUND HUNDREDS AND 
HUNDREDS OF HOUSES LIKE THIS 
BURNT OUT ROOFS GONE WINDOWS GONE 
THESE HOUSES OR MANY OF THEM 
BELONGS TO THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GEORGEIANS 
WHO USED TO LIVE HERE BUT WERE 
DRIVEN OUT IN THE WAR THERE'S DEEP 
BITTERNESS ON BOTH SIDES MARIA 
TOLD US HER ONLY SON WAS KILLED IN 
THE WAR 
BEFORE THE WAR WE HAD 
EVERYTHING HERE THEN THOSE DAMN 
GEORGIANS DESSTPROID IT ALL I SAY 
KILL ME FIRST I PRAY TO GOD 
PLEASE DO NOT LET THEM RETURN THE THE GEORGIANS DRIVEN OUT BY THE WAR 
SQUAT IN SQUALID CAMPS LIKE THIS 
THIS TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD HAS LIVED IN 
MAKESHIFT CAMPS LIKE THIS SINCE 
SHE FLED HER VILLAGE IN ABKHAZIA AT 
THE AGE OF NINE 
MOST OF THE PEOPLE 
THINK THEY WON'T GO BACK ANY MORE 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE HOPE ANY MORE 
BUT THAT I THINK WE WILL GO BACK 
BUT FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE WAR ENDED 
THERE SEEMS LITTLE HOPE THAT THIS 
FAMILY WILL EVER SEE THEIR VILLAGE 
AGAIN AGAIN THE MAIN STORIES CHINESE OFFICIALS 
SAY NEARLY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN LEFT HOMELESS BY THE 
EARTHQUAKE THAT DEVASTATED THE 
THEIR SOUTH WESTERN REGION TWENTY FOUR DAYS
