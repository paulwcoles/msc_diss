WHICH IS CALLED THE ROYAL BOIL 
ROYAL PRINCESS JOYCE HAD A LOYAL BOYFRIEND CALLED FLOYD 
TOMORROW WOULD BE THEIR WEDDING DAY 
AND JOYCE WAS OVERJOYED 
FLOYD WAS NOT A HAPPY BOY AND THE REASON WAS QUITE SIMPLE 
HE HAD A BOIL UPON HIS NOSE MUCH BIGGER THAN A PIMPLE 
SAID FLOYD THE GUESTS ARE SURE TO POINT 
THEY WILL PROBABLY AVOID ME 
THIS BOIL WILL SPOIL MY WEDDING DAY IT REALLY DOES ANNOY ME 
SO FLOYD MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE THE ROYAL NURSE 
BUT HER POISONOUS BOIL OINTMENT JUST MADE THE BOIL WORSE 
SAID JOYCE YOUR ONLY CHOICE DEAR FLOYD 
IS TO GRIT YOUR TEETH AND POP IT 
OR ELSE DEAR BOY THE WEDDING'S OFF SO DO IT NOW OR HOP IT
