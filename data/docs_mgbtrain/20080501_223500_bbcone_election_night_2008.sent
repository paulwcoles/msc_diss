EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE LECKS REALLY 
IF THE TRUTH BE TOLD FOCUSED ON THE 
KEN LIVINGSTONE BORIS JOHNSON 
BATTLE 
BATTLE EMILY 
MAIL TLIS WITH 
THE CAMPAIGNERS TONIGHT WE PROMISE 
TO BRING INTRIGUE AND GOSSIP HERE

POLITICAL FACT POLITICIANS CAN'T 
REACH WE PROMISE TO BRING RESULTS 
FROM THE PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE 
YOU IN LONDON WE'LL BE CONSIDERING 
THE RACE AN EVERYBODY'S LIPS KEN 
VERSUS BORIS NO RESULTS UNTIL 
TOMORROW THAT DOESN'T STOP THE 
DISCUSSION I'LL BE JOINED BY 
BORIS' BAD AND JOHN COLSHAW I 
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD A 
STREAM OF RESULTS TO GIVE YOU AT 
THIS STAGE BUT I HAVE ONE VERY 
IMPORTANT RESULT THE CONSERVATIVES 
IT WON'T BE ANY GREAT SURPRISE TO 
HOLD 
ANYONE 
HOLD ON TO HAM 
TAMWORTH A NET LOSS OF ONE IT 
USED TO BE LABOUR CONTROLLED 
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE IN FOR THE 
MOMENT WE'LL HAVE MORE IN IN A 
MOMENT NICK ANY NEWS FOR A START 
THE NEWS IS COMING FROM LONDON 
EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THE VOTING WILL 
BE COUNTED UNTIL TOMORROW THIS IS 
NOT HARD NEWS BUT FACT BUT RUMOUR 
AND GOSSIP FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE 
ACTIVISTS NEWS OF A HUGE TURN OUT 
INITIALLY WE WERE HEARING A BIG 
TURN OUT IN OUTER LONDON THIS IS 
THE AREA OF LONDON THAT BORIS 
JOHNSON NEEDS THE KEN HATING PARTS 
OF LONDON IN BEXLEY HIGHER THAN AT 
A GENERAL ELECTION THEN THE NEWS 
CAME IT WAS A VERY HIGH TURN OUT IN 
INNER LONDON AS WELL THE KEN 
LOVING PART OF LONDON THIS 
SUGGESTS A REAL MOTIVATION ON BOTH 
PARTIES PART IT MAKES THE RESULT 
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO CALL SOME 
TORIES PROOPS UNWISELY HAVE CALLED 
IT FOR BORIS JOHNSON 
WHAT WILL YOU 
BE LOOKING AT 
ESPECIALLY AT LIFE 
OUTSIDE LONDON L. THINK SOME PEOPLE 
NEED A REMINDER THERE IS LIFE 
OUTSIDE LONDON OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
WHO LIVE IN THE U. K. THREE QUARTERS 
LIVE OUTSIDE LONDON THEY WILL BE 
VERY INTERESTED IN TONIGHT'S 
RESULTS WHAT WILL WE BE LOOKING 
FOR WHETHER LABOUR IS GOING TO BE 
AS BADLY HIT AS EVERYBODY THINKS IT 
WILL BE INCLUDING PEOPLE ON THE 
LABOUR SIDE AND WHETHER THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE THE KIND OF 
MOMENTUM THEY NEED NOW IF THEY ARE 
TO WIN IN WHAT PROBABLY WILL BE A 
COUPLE OF YEARS TIME WE'RE WE'RE COMPARING W. THIS WITH A BAD YEAR 
FOR LABOUR TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND A GOOD YEAR 
FOR THE TORIES GIVE US A PICTURE 
OF WHAT WE WILL BE EXAMINING LET'S 
LOOK AT THE MAP THE LAY OUT 
ENGLAND AND WALES IS WHERE THESE 
ELECTIONS ARE IS BEING HELD THIS 
IS THE TERRAIN THE RAISED GREY 
BITS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE COUNCILS IN TOTAL 
INCLUDING ALL TWENTY TWO OF THE COUNCILS IN 
WALES YOU NOTICE A LOT OF SPACE 
THE LIGHT BLUE ON THE MAP F. THAT'S 
YOU WATCHING AT HOME THINKING WHY 
DIDN'T I HAVE A VOTE IN THE SOUTH 
WEST THERE WASN'T A LOT OF VOTING 
GOING ON JUST EXETER AND PLYMOUTH 
THIS IS THE MAP AS IT WAS 
CONSTITUTED GOING INTO THIS 
ELECTION THE BLUE OBVIOUSLY 
CONSERVATIVE RED LABOUR YELLOW IS 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT AND THAT'S PLAID 
CYMRU IN GREEN L. THINK IF I CAN IT 
MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE POLLS AND 
THE WAY THEY TELL THE STORY OF MR. 
MR. BROWN'S PREMIERSHIP SINCE HE 
TOOK OVER LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE 
POLLS WERE DOING IN 
LAST YEAR 
WHEN MR. BLAIR WAS IN HIS FINAL 
MOMENTS AS PRIME MINISTER I'LL 
BRING IT UP HERE YOU'LL SEE THAT 
WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE AHEAD BUT NOT BY 
MUCH THIRTY SIX AND THIRTY THREE AND THE BROWN 
BOUNCE THAT EVERYONE TALKED ABOUT 
AT THE TIME SEEMS LIKE A DISTANT 
MEMORY AND THEN THINGS STARTED TO 
GO WRONG YOU CAN SEE THE POLLS 
GRADUALLY TURNING AGAINST MR. BROWN 
AND YOU WATCH THE SEQUENCE OF THE 
CONSERVATIVES STARTING TO LOCK IN 
QUITE A HANDY LEAD FROM THEIR POINT 
OF VIEW THAT BASICALLY STAYS IN 
PLACE THE QUESTION TONIGHT IS 
WHETHER THE REAL VOTE SUCH A 
RELIEF TO HAVE REAL VOTES TO COUNT 
THE REAL VOTES UNDERLINE WHAT THE 
POLLS HAVE BEEN TELLING US SINCE MR. 
BROWN'S PREMIERSHIP BEGAN TO GO IN 
THE WORDS OF HIS CRITICS SLIGHTLY 
AWRY BACK TO THE MAPS TO LOOK AT 
AREAS WE'LL BE FOCUSSING ON LOCAL 
ELECTIONS LOCAL STORIES NOT ALL 
VOTING HAPPENS ON A NATIONAL BASIS 
THEIR PARTICULARITIES IN COUNCILS 
THAT WE WILL LOOK AT THAT MAKES 
THEM INTERESTING WE WILL HAVE 
NATIONAL AREAS CAERPHILLY LABOUR 
A SMALL SWING TO PLAID CYMRU THE 
WELSH NATIONALISTS TWO PER CENT WOULD TAKE 
THE COUNCIL FROM LABOUR IF YOU ARE 
INTERESTED IN HOW THE LIB DEMS AND 
CONSERVATIVES ARE DOING YOU 
MENTIONED NICK CLEGG THE NICK 
CLEGG DAVID CAMERON TUSSLE WILL BE 
HIGHLIGHTED IN CHELTENHAM A SIX PER CENT 
SWING TO THE CONSERVATIVES WOULD 
GIVE THEM THE COUNCIL READING 
LABOUR SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND A VERY RARE 
DOT OF RED THERE IN SOUTH EAST 
ENGLAND FOUR PER CENT SWING WOULD TAKE THE 
COUNCIL FROM LABOUR AND IN THE 
SOUTH EAST IS THURROCK THURROCK 
HAD BEEN LABOUR CONSERVATIVE O. 
CONSERVATIVE AND AGAINST THE TREND 
THE CONSERVATIVES LOST IT LAST YEAR 
THEY NEED A TINY SWING TO GET 
THURROCK BACK AND UP HERE IN THE 
NORTHEAST THE CONSERVATIVES WOULD 
LOVE TO GET NORTH TYNESIDE THEY 
ARE ALWAYS TOLD THEY DON'T HAVE 
ENOUGH COUNCILLORS IN CERTAIN AREAS 
THIS IS OUTSIDE THEIR COMFORT ZONE 
THEY NEED TWO PER CENT SWING ALTHOUGH IT 
DOES HAVE A LONDON MAYOR TESSA 
JOWELL DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF 
FOREBODING AS MANY COMMENTATORS SAY 
YOU PROBABLY DO AS YOU GO INTO 
THIS EVENING AND THESE RESULTS I I DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF FOREBODING L. 
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE WAIT AND 
SEE WHAT THE RESULTS ACTUALLY ARE 
AND HAVING 
THAT WOULD NOT STOP 
YOU HAVING A SENSE OF FOREBODING 
WITH RESPECT 
I THINK ALL THE 
INDICATIONS ARE THIS IS LIKELY TO 
BE TOUGH L. THINK THAT ONE OF THE 
THINGS YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE I 
MEAN I FOUGHT AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF 
ELECTION CAMPAIGNSS AS MANY OF MY 
COLLEAGUES ARE AND YOU FIND WHEN 
YOU HAVE THE BENEFIT OF TALKING TO 
PEOPLE BEING ON THE STREETS AND 
KNOCKING ON PEOPLE'S DOORS YOU GET 
A MUCH MORE MEASURED VIEW OF THE 
WORLD THAN SITTING IN A STUDIO 
LIKE THIS OR WITHIN HALF A MILE OF 
THIS STUDIO 
NOT SURE WHAT THIS 
MEANS 
I DON'T THINK IT'S AS BAD MEANS FOR US AS MANY OF THE COMMENTATORS 
SUGGEST HAVING SAID THAT I'M NOT 
PREDICTING TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE 
EASY FOR US MOST OF MY TIME OVER 
THE LAST TWO MONTHS HAS BEEN SPENT 
IN LONDON HELPING TO ORGANISE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE CAMPAIGN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR WAS SO 
BAD FOR YOU IT CAN'T GET WORSE 
THAN THAT 
LET'S SEE BY THE END OF 
TONIGHT 
YOU'RE NOT OPTIMISTIC OF TONIGHT GAINS 
I HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND I GAINS DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN PRE EMENT 
THE RESULTS 
YOU GOT FORTY PER CENT AS THE 
TORIES ON THE NATIONAL SHARE LAST 
YEAR PEOPLE SAY YOU HAVE TO DO 
BETTER THAN THAT TO SHOW YOU HAVE 
MOMENTIM 
FORTY PER CENT WILL BE GOOD WE WILL WAIT AND 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE COUNCIL 
WERE FOUGHT FOUR YEARS AGO WE GOT 
THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT WE WANT TO MAKE AN VANS ON 
THAT AS THE CONSERVATIVES WE WANT 
TO DEMONSTRATE WE CAN GOVERN 
LOCALLY THAT THE CHANGE WE CAN 
BRING TO THE LOCAL COUNCILS IS 
CHANGE WE CAN BRING NA NATIONALLY 
I AM LOOKING AT COUNCILS LIKE 
BIRMINGHAM WHERE THE CONSERVATIVES 
HAVE RUN A SUCCESSFUL 
ADMINISTRATION LED A SUCCESSFUL 
ADMINISTRATION GOT ONE OF THE 
LOWEST COUNCIL TAXES OR HAS ONE OF 
THE LOWEST COUNCIL TAXES THERE IS 
KIRK LEES THERE WE WANT TO DO WELL 
NATIONALLY OF COURSE THIS IS A 
HUGE TEST FOR GORDON BROWN 
ARE YOU SAYING IT IS MORE OF A TEST 
FOR GORDON BROWN THAN DAVID 
CAMERON 
WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE THE CAMERON STEADY PROGRESS THE MOMENTUM AS 
YOU PUT IT BUT THESE ARE THE FIRST 
ELECTIONS THAT GORDON BROWN HAS 
FOUGHT AS THE PRIME MINISTER THEY 
ARE NOT MIDTERM IN THE CLASSIC 
SENSE LABOUR HAS DONE THEIR BIG 
GAMBLE OF PAERPLT PARLIAMENT 
THEY HAVE CHANGED LEADERSHIP 
WITHOUT EVEN A LEADERSHIP ELECTION 
CERTAINLY NOT A GENERAL ELECTION 
BUT WE ARE AWARE WE ARE FIGHTING 
OFF A HIGH BASE 
CHARLES CLARKE YOU DID BETTER THAN 
ANY OTHER LIBERAL DEMOCRATS LEADER 
IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
DID I AM 
NOT HERE TO BLOW MY OWN TRUMPET 
YOU GOT TWO PER CENT DO YOU THINK THAT NICK 
CLEGG WILL DO AS WELL TONIGHT IT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE LABOUR IS IN 
GREAT DIFFICULTYY LABOUR DROPPED A 
FIRST PLACE WHEN I WAS AROUND L. 
DON'T THINK THAT HAD HAPPENED 
BEFORE WHEN GEORGE IF I CAN ADD 
TO HIS ACCOUNT THERE BIG CITIES 
THAT WERE RUNNING LIKE NEWCASTLE 
LIVERPOOL SO ON AND BIRMINGHAM 
GREAT ADVANCES MADE IN BIRMINGHAM 
NOT JUST DUE TO THE CONSERVATIVES 
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEMOCRATS THE QUESTION WAS WILL NICK CLEGG DO 
AS WELL YOU AS YOU DID 
I THINK 
WE ARE IN FOR A SOLID PERFORMANCE 
FOUR YEARS AGO IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF 
THE IRAQ CONTROVERSY THE ABSENCE 
OF WUX IT CAST A MASSIVE SHADOW 
MAYBE TO A SLIGHTLY UNHEALTHY 
EFFECT OVER THE LOCALISED ELECTIONS 
WE WERE SIGNIFICANT BENEFICIARIES 
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF TALK ABOUT 
THE LEADERS NICK HAS BEEN IN THE 
JOB FOR A MATTER OF WEEKS DAVID 
CAMERON WILL BE MEASURED IN TERMS 
OF HOW THE CONSERVATIVES DO 
OBVIOUSLY GORDON BROWN IS BEING 
ROASTING ONG THE SPIT BY MANY 
COMMENTATORS AND BY SOME OF HIS OWN 
PEOPLE AT THE MOMENT IF IT IS A 
BAD NIGHT IT WILL ADD TO THAT L. 
DON'T THINK IT IS A BAROMETER OF 
OUR OWN LEADERSHIP 
WE WILL COME BACK TO THAT LET'S GO 
AROUND THE COUNTRY A BIT AND JOIN 
MICHAEL CRITIC IN BERRY IN GREATER 
MANCHESTER THAT IS ONE OF THE 
PLACES THAT THE TORIES ARE HOPING 
TO TAKE IT COULD BE AN IMPORTANT 
SIGN IF THEY DO THAT THEY ARE 
MAKING HEAD WAY IN THE NORTH HAVE 
YOU SIGN OF ANYTHING YET 
NO BUT 
BURY IS THE HOME OF THE FAMOUS 
BLACK PUDDING THE BIRTHPLACE OF 
SIR ROBERT PEEL IT IS A BIG TARGET 
FOR THE TORIES IN THE NORTH WEST 
IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL TONIGHT IT 
WILL ACT AS A BRIDGE HEAD FOR GAINS 
IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IN 
THE IN CONNECTION ELECTION IN THE 
NORTH WEST YOU TALK TO LABOUR 
THEY ARE SAYING IT WILL NOT BE A 
GREAT NIGHT FOR LABOUR BUT IT IS 
NOT MELTDOWN LIETHER THERE ARE 
SOURCES SAYING THAT THEY MAY 
ANYBODY TROUBLE IN A SAFE WARD NOT 
JUST THE WARDS TARGETED BY THE 
CONSERVATIVES I SPOKE TO VOTERS 
THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING 
TRYING TO FIND OUT WHY THEY WERE 
VOTING THE WAY THAT THEY WERE WHY 
THEY WERE NOT VOTING LABOUR THERE 
WAS A LOT OF MENTION OF THE TEN 
PENCE TAX RATE GORDON BROWN'S 
PERFORMANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
AN ELECTION NOBODY MENTIONED THE 
WAR SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE WAR IS 
FINALLYIFIEDING FADING AS AN 
ELECTION ISSUE THERE WERE A WHOLE 
RANGE OF OTHER GRUMBLES BUT I WAS 
NOT CONVINCED THAT THE GRUMBLING 
WAS GOING TO THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
THERE WERE NOT THAT MANY NEW 
CONSERVATIVES SOME WERE GOING TO 
THE B. N. P. SOME WERE ABSTAINING TO 
THE LIB DEMS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE WHOLE OF WALES EVERYONE WHO 
REGISTERED AND WANTED TO VOTE WAS 
ABLE TO VOTE TODAY 
BETHSON IS DOWN IN WALES BETHSON 
WHAT IS YOU LOOKING FOR TONIGHT 
WELL THERE IS LIFE OUTSIDE OF 
LONDON AS I HEARD SOMEONE MENTION 
EARLIER THERE WOULD BE LIFE INLE 
VEIL OF GLAM ORGAN IF A LOAD OF 
POSTAL VOTES HAD NOT BEEN HANDED IN 
SO THINGS STARTING SLOWLY TPWHRU 
ARE QUESTIONS IN WALES ONE FAIRLY 
OBVIOUS ONE FOR THE WELSH LABOUR 
I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW THE ANSWER 
IT IS IF THERE IS A BIG ANTI LABOUR 
SWING DOES RHODRI MORGAN'S LABOUR 
FEEL THE FORCE OF IT OR MAY THEY 
WEATHER THE STORM THEY HOLD SEVEN 
OF THE TWENTY TWO COUNCILS HERE OUTRIGHT IF 
YOU START HEARING ABOUT FLINCHER 
NEW IT'S PORT THOSE SORTS OF 
PLACES FALLING TO NO OVERALL 
CONTROL THEN THEY ARE NOT HAVING A 
GOOD NIGHT OF IT 
THE LIB DEMS WILL DO WELL TO HANG 
ON TO WHAT THEY HAVE GOT NEW NOW 
THE CONSERVATIVES THAT STORY IT IS 
HAPPENING IN BARRY THEY COULD BE 
TAKING THIS COUNCIL WITH EASE AT 
THIS SORT OF TIME THEY ARE QUIETLY 
CONFIDENT BUT YOU GET THE FEELING 
IF LABOUR GO DOWN IT WILL BE WITH A 
FIGHT THAT LEAVES THE FOURTH BIG 
PARTY IN WALES PLAID CYMRU IN 
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT OF COURSE IN 
COALITION WITH LABOUR NOW HOW HAS 
THAT BEEN PLAYING ON THE DOORSTEPS 
MIGHT THEY PAY A PRICE FOR THAT 
THERE ARE STORIES COMING FROM THE 
GWYNETH COUNCIL THAT THEY HOLD OUT 
THERE COULD ABFEW SKALS TAKEN THERE 
PLAID CYMRU WILL DO WELL IF THEY 
CAN PROVE THAT THE NEW NIGHT TIME 
OF THEM ARE THE NEW PARTY OF WALES 
WE ARE GETTING THE FIRST NEWS FROM 
THE KEY WARDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
WE MEASURE HOW PEOPLE ARE VOTING 
BETWEEN THE THREE PARTIES AS WELL 
AS GIVING THE RESULTS COUNSELLED BY 
COUNCIL THE MEASURES ARE THAT IT 
IS LOOKING GOOD FOR THE TORIES 
LOOKING BAD FOR THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS AND LABOUR THE SAME AS 
IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR SO NOT MUCH HAS 
CHANGED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
THE BURY RESULT THAT CRICK WAS 
TALKING ABOUT IS LOOKING GOOD 
THE POLLS ARE SHOWING SWING TO 
THE TORIES SINCE THE LAST GENERAL 
ELECTION APPROACHING TEN PER CENT TO TAKE 
BURY THEY NEED A SWING OF ONLY PER CENT OR 
SIX PER CENT IF THEY DO NOT DO THAT ONE 
WILL BEGIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE 
POLLS ARE ACCURATE AS THIS IS A 
TYPICAL PLACE WHERE THE TORIES HAVE 
TO WIN IF THEY TAKE IT IT WILL BE 
A GOOD SIGN NOT JUST FOR THE NEXT 
MONTH BUT FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
YEARS YEARS THE SIGNS ARE INTERESTING IT 
CONFIRMING WHAT WE KNOW THAT WILL 
BE A POOR NIGHT FOR LABOUR THE 
QUESTION IS HOW POOR IF IT IS 
ABOUT WHAT IT WAS A YEAR AGO OR 
FOUR YEARS AGO THEY WILL SAY THAT 
THEY WENT ON TO WIN A GENERAL 
ELECTION AFTER A POOR LOCAL 
ELECTION PERFORMANCE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE BUT 
THE CRITICS WILL SAY THAT THEY HAVE 
CHANGED LEADERS TALKED OF RENEWING 
THEY SHOULD BE DOING BETTER NICK 
CLEGG WILL HAVE A HARDER STORY TO 
TELL IT WILL LOOK AS THOUGH HE IS 
GOING BACKWARDS THEY WILL LOOK FOR 
INDIVIDUAL COUNCIL THEY CAN POINT 
TO THAT DEMONSTRATES SOME SORT OF 
PROGRESS PROGRESS THE MEASURE OF HOW YOU JUDGE 
SUCCESS IS GOING TO BE TERRIBLY 
IMPORTANT ARE YOU JUDGING AGAINST 
LAST YEAR WHEN TONY BLAIR WAS 
UNPOPULAR FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN HE 
WAS MASSIVELY UNPOPULAR BECAUSE OF 
THE IRAQ SITUATION OR BECAUSE OF A 
BASELINE EXPECKATION AS TO WHAT 
GORDON BROWN SHOULD BE DOING AS A 
NEW LEADER 
NOW YES JOIN EMILY MAITLIS

NORMALLY A POLITICS FREE ZONE BUT 
NOT IN THE WORLD OF BLOGGING ALL

BEFORE WE GO I WILL TELL YOU THAT 
YOU THAT THE NEXT GUEST TO COME 
BACK IS ONE DEAD RINGER JOHN COL 
SFRBGS HAW 
THERE IS YOUR MAN 
WE ARE TALKING TO HIM IN FEW 
MOMENTS WHEN HE IS TAKING US 
THROUGH THE POLITICIANS 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN 
CONTROL OF HULL ON HIS BLOG 
LIVERPOOL IS KEY PLACE WHERE THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN IN 
TROUBLE BECAUSE THE AUDIT 
COMMISSION SAID THEY WERE DOING 
BADLY ON THE FINANCIAL FRONT THEY 
ARE DESPERATE TO HOLD TON LIVERPOOL 
DO YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION DAVID 
WHAT IS HAPPENING UP THERE 
IF YOU 
WHAT IS HAPPENING UP THERE IF YOU TALK TO JOE ANDERSON HE IS SAYING 
THAT THEY WILL TAKE LIVERPOOL INTO 
NO OVER CONTROL PICKING UP SIX 
SEATS BASED ON THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE 
ORIGINALLY BEEN ELECTED IF YOU 
TALK TO LIB DEM ACTIVISTS THEY HAVE 
BEEN SAYING WE THINK THERE WILL BE 
A LOW TURNOUT WE DON'T THINK THERE 
IS THE ANGER ON THE STREETS THEY 
JOKINGLY REFER TO GORDON BROWN 
BEING THE BEST CANVASSER FOR THE 
LIB DEMS THEY ARE BACKING GORDON 
THEY CLAIM HE IS GETTING A LIB DEM 
VOTES COMING THEIR WAY 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH BACK UP THERE 
NOW A LOOK AT JEREMY WITH THE KEY 
WARDS THAT HAVE COME IN AND THE 
CHANGE THEY ARE SHOWING PERHAPS OUR 
THREE POLITICIANS WOULD COMMENT ON 
WHAT WE HAVE GLEANED SO FAR JEREMY 
TINY CRUMBS FROM US OUR KEY WARDS 
NINE HUNDRED FIFTY NEARLY ONE THOUSAND WARDS WE ARE 
LOOKING AS ARE COMING IN TO GIVE US 
SOME IDEA OF HOW THIS LOCAL 
ELECTION WOULD PLAY ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY IF IT HAD BEEN NELSON 
MANDELA THAT WAY WITH EVERYONE 
VOTING LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPEN SOD 
VOTING LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPEN SOD FAR TEN PER CENT SO FAR THAT IS TWO HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND 
PEOPLES VOTES HAVE BEEN COUNTED 
I WILL SHOW YOU THE CHANGE ON LAST 
TIME THE SEATS WERE CONTESTED 
MAINLY TWO THOUSAND FOUR OF COURSE LET'S HAVE A 
LOOK WE START WITH LABOUR THEY 
ARE DOWN THREE PER CENT ON THESE EARLY COUNTS 
THREE PER CENT DOWN CONSERVATIVES ARE UP SIX PER CENT L. 
WANT TO HEAR GEORGE OZ BORN'S 
REACTION TO THAT L. DON'T KNOW IF 
IT WILL BE SUSTAINED THROUGHOUT THE 
NIGHT LET'S SEE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
ARE DOWN FOUR PER CENT A LOOK AT OTHERS NOT 
REALLY SHIFTING VERY MUCH SO FAR 
EARLY DAYS THAT IS WHAT WE'VE GOT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH JEREMY 
CHARLES KENNEDY IT IS NOT LOOKING 
TOO HOT IS IT FOR LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
ON THOSE FIGURES 
I THINK THAT THE 
THING HERE IS FIRST OF ALL YOU 
TAKE THIS HULL RESULT L. KNOW THIS 
ISN'T ABSOLUTELY CONFIRMED BUT 
WITH A LOCAL DEFECTION THERE LAST 
YEAR IF WE RETOOK ONE WARD WE ARE 
BACK IN OVERALL CONTROL OF HULL IF 
IT IS THE CEASE WE HAVE TAKEN FIVE 
THAT WOULD BE AT LABOUR'S EXPENSE 
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT IN LIVERPOOL 
LOOKING AT THE FIGURES HERE IT IS 
FORTY SEVEN LIB DEM WARDS AT THE MOMENT THIRTY FIVE 
LABOUR LABOUR YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF VACANCIES 
FOUR LIBERALS AND SOME OTHERS ONE 
INDEPENDENT AND SO ON L. WOULD 
THINK IT IS EARLY TO SAY YET 
JUDGING BY WHAT OUR PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING WE WOULD STILL I THINK BL 
PROBABLE THE LARGEST PARTY IN 
LIVERPOOL IN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF 
LIVERPOOL BY ALL SAID AND DONE IN 
OUR MORE TESTING ELECTIONS THAN 
SOME OF THESE PLACES SO FAR SO 
GOOD 
OF COURSE TWO THOUSAND FOUR WAS A GOOD GOOD YEAR FOR YOU IT WAS A BAD YEAR FOR 
LABOUR FOR LABOUR SHOWING SIGNS OF 
IT BEING WORSE IS PRETTY DISMAL 
LET'S SEE IF IT IS BORNE OUT 
THROUGH THE NIGHT LET'S BEAR IN 
MIND SUSPECT PEOPLE WATCHING AT 
HOME WILL SAY THIS WELL YOU CAN'T 
JUST ASSUME THAT INDIVIDUAL LOCAL 
RESULTS ARE DRIVEN SOLELY BY 
NATIONAL TRENDS AND NATIONAL ISSUES 
WE HAVE COME HERE WITH OUR 
PARTICULAR BRIEFINGS ON PARTICULAR 
COUNCILS IT ISN'T CLEAR CUT 
I MEAN I'M NOT FOR ONE MOMENT 
DENYINGLET EXTENT TO WHICH SOME 
PEOPLE WILL BE REGISTERING 
PROTEST AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR 
ACTUALLY SOME PEOPLE MAY BE 
STANDING UP FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN A 
DIFFICULT TIME THROUGH THE WAY THEY 
VOTED IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS THESE 
ARE LOCAL ELECTION THERE IS IS A 
LIMIT TO HOW FAR YOU CAN GENERALISE 
FROM THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS TO A 
LIKELY GENERAL ELECTION RESULT 
THINK TONY WILL CORRECT ME IF I'M 
WRONG I THINK ACTUALLY IN ORDER 
TO FIND A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT 
PEOPLE SAID AT LOCAL ELECTIONS YOU 
HAVE TO GO BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHEN WE 
WERE ON FORTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE VOTE WE THEN 
WENT ON TWO YEARS LATER TO WIN THE 
GENERAL ELECTION 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR YES WE HAD A BAD YEAR WE 
WENT ON THE NEXT YEAR TO WIN THE 
GENERAL ELECTION WHAT I THINK IT 
IS IMPORTANT TO DO IS TO SEPARATE 
OUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOW 
PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND VOTE 
IN LOCAL ELECTIONS AND THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND 
GENERAL ELECTION THIS IS NOT GENERAL ELECTION 
NO NOBODY IS 
PRETENDING IT IS A GENERAL ELECTION 
IT IS AN INDICATION OF REAL VOTING 
ABOUT THE FEELING IN THE COUNTRY 
YOU ARE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
BEEN WARNING THAT LABOUR WILL LOSE 
THE ELECTION IF IT GOES ON OPPOSING 
ITSELF IF PEOPLE GO ON COMPLAINING 
YOU TALKED ABOUT IF WE FIGHT LIKE 
FERRETS IN THE SACK PRESUMABLY 
WHAT YOU THINK IS HAPPENING AT THE 
MOMENT 
THIS IS NOT A NEW POLITICAL MOMENT LESSON THAT DIVIDED PARTIES YOU YOU THINK IT IS A DIVIDED PARTY I I DON'T 
THINK WE ARE DIVIDED PARTY L. THINK 
WHY DID YOU SAY IT THEN L. L. I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT 
WE HAVE CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT THE 
COUNTRY WANTS OF US THAT IN 
GOVERNMENT WE WORK TO MEET THE 
COUNTRY'S EXPECTATIONS OF US ALL ALL THIS SNIPING AT BROWN AND THE FUSS 
OVER THE TEN P. RATE THE REVOLT THAT 
DIDN'T QUITE HAPPEN OVER THAT THE 
REMARKS BY MANDELSON CHARLES 
CLARKE LORD LEVY IT DOESN'T MEAN 
THE PARTY IS IN TROUBLE NOBODY IS 
DOING THAT IN THE TORY PARTY IF IF YOU TAKE THE GOVERNMENT AND YOU 
TAKE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CENTRAL TO 
MAKING GOVERNMENT WORK AND MAKING 
THE GOVERNMENT WORK FOR THE PEOPLE 
OF THIS COUNTRY AFTER ALL THAT IS 
THE MOST THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE 
OF OUR EXISTENCE 
I THINK THAT THERE IS EXTRAORDINARY 
UNITY IN THE GOVERNMENT IN THE 
SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE L. THINK 
THAT A WILLINGNESS TO DEBATE IS 
DIFFERENT FROM DIVISION THERE ARE 
NOT DIVISIONS IN THE LABOUR PARTY 
SUCH AS THOSE THAT CHARACTERISE THE 
TORY PARTY THROUGHOUT THE LATE EIGHTIES 
AND INTO THE NINETIES 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T 
HAVE ANYBODY READY TO TAKE OVER THE 
LEADERSHIP FROM GORDON BROWN AND 
CHALLENGE FOR IT 
NO NO THAT IS 
ABSOLUTELY NOT RIGHT THERE IS 
BROAD CONSENSUS IN THE LABOUR PARTY 
THAT NEW LABOUR THAT BEING ABLE TO 
ATTRACT SUPPORT FROM A VERY WIDE 
RANGE OF PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS 
OF THE COUNTRY O. K. PIEING THE 
CENTRE GROUND THAT IS THE 
CONSENSUS THAT BRITISH PEOPLE WANT 
I SAID SOME PEOPLE WILL BE CROWING 
AND SOME PEOPLE DEFENDING YOUR 
POSITION ARE YOU GROWING OVER A 
SIX POINT IMPROVEMENT IN TWO HUNDRED FOUR B. I. E. 
THE TORIES 
IF IT WAS BORNE OUT 
THROUGH THE NIGHT THAT WOULD BE 
GOOD FOR US WE ARE GAINING COUNCIL 
SEATS IN SUNDERLAND IN THE NORTH 
EAST AND NEAR MY CONSTITUENCY IN 
THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND SEATS 
IN WHITNEY THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED 
DUE TO THE LOCAL M. P. BEING DAVID 
CAMERON CONSERVATIVE COUNCILORS 
ARE BEING ELECTED AND CONSERVATIVE 
COUNCILS DELIVERING POLICIES ON THE 
GROUND 
WORCESTER A HUNG COUNCIL GROUND STAYS THE SAME CONSERVATIVES SEVENTEEN 
LABOUR ON THIRTEEN NO CHANGE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS ON THREE SLIGHT 
DISAPPOINTMENT 
THAT SAN ASTONISHING RESULT I MUST 
SAY THAT IS ONE I THOUGHT WAS 
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN TO GO TO THE 
CONSERVATIVES WHY 
BECAUSE THEY CONSERVATIVES WHY WERE ONLY ONE SEAT SHORT THEY 
CONTROLLED IT UNTIL RECENTLY THEY 
LOST IT IN BY ELECTION AMAZINGLY 
LAST AUTUMN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A 
WALK OVER FOR THE TORIES I'M 
STARTLED 
IT HELPS IN A SENSE TO STARTLED WORK THROUGH WHAT TESSA JOWELL IS 
SAYING SHE IS RIGHT THESE ARE NOT 
NATIONAL ELECTIONS WHY THEY MATTER 
NATIONALLY IS BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK 
IN INDIVIDUAL AREAS AND SAY IS THIS 
A BUILDING BLOCK TO NATIONAL 
PARLIAMENTARY SUCCESS THAT CASE IT 
CLEARLY ISN'T THE TORIES SHOULD BE 
WINNING A COUNCIL LIKE THAT IN 
ORDER TO NOTCH UP ONE ON THAT 
MASSIVE MOUNTAIN THEY HAVE TO GO UP 
LOOK THAT THE ONE TUNBRIDGE WELLS TUNBRIDGE WELLS IS A 
TORY SLASH LIBERAL DEMOCRAT BATTLEGROUND 
THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE A HUGE 
MAJORITY ON THE COUNCIL THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS OVERALL LOSE THREE AND 
THE TORIES GAIN THREE IS THAT 
DISTURBING FOR THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS 
WELL YES AND NO BECAUSE DEMOCRATS IN A WAY THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO 
WIN THE SEAT THE KEY THING IS 
WINNING WHERE IT MATTERS NOT 
AMASSING SEATS OR INDEED VOTES 
WHERE IT DOESN'T MATTER TUNBRIDGE TUNBRIDGE WELLS DOES IT IT NOT MATTER HOW THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS DO AGAINST THE 
TORIES IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND 
THAT IS 
A FAIR POINT IT IS THE PERCEPTION 
OF THE INDIVIDUAL SEATS THERE THE 
FIGURES YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE 
BACK DROP TO THIS IS AN 
OVERWHELMING CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY 
WHAT WILL BE MORE SIGNIFICANT IS IF 
YOU LOOK AT PERHAPS SOMERSET WHAT 
MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE COUNCIL THERE 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT DAY 
WHERE IT'S QUITE FINELY BALANCED 
NOT MUCH IN THE WEST COUNTRY AT ALL 
IN THESE ELECTIONS 
NOT MUCH 
SOMERSET WILL BE SOMETHING OF 
POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT STRAW IN 
THE WIND IT IS MUCH MORE EVENLY 
MATCHED THAT WILL TELL YOU MORE 
PEOPLE KNOW EITHER SIDE COULD WIN 
WHICH I SUSPECT OBVIOUSLY LOOKING 
AT THOSE FIGURES AIN'T THE 
PERCEPTION IN TUNBRIDGE WELLS 
THERE IS POINT ABOUT CONTROLLING 
LOCAL COUNCILS ONE OF THE THINGS 
THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE MANAGED TO 
DO IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IS TAKE 
CONTROL IN AREA WHERE IS THERE ARE 
LABOUR M. P.'S YOU CAN GO TO PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY WHERE EVERY COUNCILOR 
IS THE CONSERVATIVE AND THE M. P. IS 
STILL LABOUR THE FIRST RESULT 
TONIGHT WAS TAMWORTH 
TALKING ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVES HAD 
GAINED A SEAT WE CONTROLLED 
TAMWORTH COUNCIL TAMWORTH HAS 
LABOUR M. P. REMEMBER WHEN I WAS 
HERE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES I WAS THE 
RESEARCHER PASSING THE NOTES IN AND 
SO ON WE SAW CONSERVATIVE SEATS 
WITH CONSERVATIVE M. P.'S LOSE THEIR 
COUNCILS TO THE LABOUR PARTY OR THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS THEN THAT THE 
SUBSEQUENT GENERAL ELECTION THE 
SEATS THEMSELVES FALL NOT JUST 
BECAUSE THEY INDICATE SOMETHING 
ABOUT NATIONAL VOTE IT IS 
LOCALLY YOU THEN HAVE IF YOU ARE A 
LABOUR M. P. NO SUPPORT ON THE GROUND 
THE COUNCIL IS CONSERVATIVE IT IS 
WORKING WITH 
IT IS NOT ENTIRELY 
TRUE TRADITIONALLY YOU HAVE ONE 
CONTROLLING PART OF THE COUNCIL AND 
ONE IS AN ELECTED METROPOLITAN 
POLICE 
GENERAL ELECTIONS TEND TO POLICE RESET RESET BACK TO JEREMY VINE 
GEORGE OSBOURNE WILL RECOGNISE THIS 
PLACE THE FROZEN AREA WHERE THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN FOR SO MANY 
YEARS OUTS OF GOVERNMENT HERE ON 
THE WALLACE THE CHILL WIND BLOWS 
THROUGH THE STUDIO I CAN SEE THE 
PICTURES OF THE ASSENT OF MAN FROM 
THE CROUCHING ANTICIPATE TO HOME 
OWERECTUS STANDING PROUD WE WILL 
ASK WHETHER THE CONSERVATIVE ASSENT 
COULD BE COMPLETED TONIGHT BACK TO 
THE YEAR THAT MR. OSBOURNE MENTIONED 
NINETEEN NINETY SIX THERE WE ARE JOHN MAJOR NINETY FIVE 
TWENTY SIX PER CENT THERE HE IS KNUCKLE 
DRAGGING 
POOR PERFORMANCE IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS A LONG WAY TO GO FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO CAME NEXT 
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WILLIAM HAGUE DOING BETTER IN 
LOCAL ELECTIONS WITH THIRTY THREE PER CENT SERIOUS 
ORTHOPAEDIC PROBLEMS THE GUY IS IN 
NEED OF A BACK MASSAGE OF SOME KIND 
WHO CAME NEXT IN TWO THOUSAND TWO IAIN DUNCAN 
SMITH THIRTY FIVE PER CENT YOU CAN SEE THE 
PROGRESSION YOU CAN SEE THE PARTY 
GRADUALLY STRAIGHTENING UP AND 
WALKING TALL STILL NOWHERE NEAR 
WINNING A GENERAL LECTION MICHAEL 
HOWARD THOUGHT HE MIGHT TWO THOUSAND FOUR THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT 
IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS THERE 
ALMOST STRAIGHT BUT NOT QUITE 
STILL STOUPING LITTLE BIT 
UNCOMFORTABLE IN HIS POSTURE THEN 
WE MOVE TO DAVID CAMERON 
FORTY PER CENT TWO YEARS RUNNING THIS NOW IS 
THE TEST ISN'T IT FOR MR. CAMERON 
CAN HE REMAIN TALL UPRIGHT AND IN 
A POSITION WHERE HE MIGHT THINK 
ABOUT WINNING A GENERAL ELECTION 
CAN LE STAY AS TORY ELECT DOES US 
ANY LOWER THAN FORTY IT WILL LOOK AS 
IF HIS WHOLE PARTY IS MOVING 
BACKWARDS BACK TO YOU 
BACKWARDS BACK TO YOU 
LET'S DO 
WHAT WE WILL DO ONCE OR TWICE IN 
THE EVENING LOOK AT THE RESULTS IN 
MORE DETAIL FROM THE EXPERTS IN THE 
AREA WHERE YOU ARE WATCHING 
OFF THEY GO 
NOW WE HAVE NEWS FROM CHELTENHAM 
YOU HAVE YES YOU THINK THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS DOING WELL IN 
CHELTENHAM 
WHAT YOU SAID AT THE CHELTENHAM TOP OF THE PROGRAMME ABOUT 
CHELTENHAM THIS IS AN EXAMPLE 
OBVIOUSLY OF A MUCH MORE FINELY 
BALANCED CONTEST HEAD TO HEAD 
CONSERVATIVES AND OURSELVES WE ARE 
MAKING GAINS AT THE CONSERVATIVES'S 
EXPENSE THERE THAT IS SIGNIFICANT 
THAT GOING BACK TO WHAT GEORGE WAS 
FAIRLY SAYING A MOMENT AGO 
CHELTENHAM AN EXAMPLE WHERE WE ALSO 
HOLD THE PARLIAMENTARY SEATS IF 
THERE IS A DEGREE INAUDIBLE 
ACROSS THERE 
HULL HAS COME UP 
REGAINED HULL EARLY OMENS I THINK 
PRETTY GOOD 
WE HAVE NEWS WE HAVE TAKEN WEST 
LINDSAY COUNCIL FROM LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS HARLOW WE HAVE TAKEN 
CONTROL OF THAT CRUCIAL SEAT FOR 
US IN THE GENERAL ELECTION 
CURRENTLY HELD BY LABOUR THERE IS 
A GOOD TWO SEATS IN WIGAN GOOD 
NEWS AS WELL LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT HULL 
SO THE NOSTALGIC PRESCOTT FACTOR 
DID NOT WORK ITS MAGIC AMAZING IT IT IS INTERESTING THE RESULTS THAT WE 
ARE GETTING IN THE SOUTH THE 
ASSUMPTION WAS THERE WOULD BE A 
RETREAT FROM THE SOUTH THAT THEY 
WOULD START TO LOSE IN THE SOUTH 
AND THE TORIES WOULD GET MANY OF 
THOSE SEATS BACK THAT MARGARET 
THATCHER USED TO HOLD WE HAVE 
HEARD CHELTENHAM AND WORCESTER THE 
TORIES ARE NOT MAKING THE KIND OF 
ADVANCES THEY WOULD WANT TO MAKE 
THEY MAY MAKE ADVANCES IN OTHER 
PLACES THE WAY THAT THESE WILL BE 
ANALYSED NOT TONIGHT BUT IN A DAY 
OR TWO BY THE PARTY HIS SEAT BY 
SEAT ARE WE DOING ENOUGH TO GAIN 
THAT CONSTITUENCY 
IT IS 
INTERESTING WE HAVE HAD THE RAW 
FIGURE THE ANALYSIS THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS LOOKING LIKE THEY ARE 
DOING WORSE THAN TWO THOUSAND FOUR BUT THE 
RESULTS ARE COMING THROUGH BETTER 
REMEMBER LORD THINGS CAN HAPPEN 
IT CAN TAKE A LOT OF VOTES TO WIN 
ONE WARD IN MAJOR CITY VERY FEW 
VOTES LOST AND YOU MIGHT NEWS TWO 
WHAT THREE IN SHIRE DISTRICT THE 
TOTAL NUMBER OF VOTES MAY NOT BE 
THE MOST IMPORTANT GUIDE 
I TRIED 
TO BREAK THIS PROGRAMME UP AND LET 
YOU WHEREVER YOU ARE IN THE 
COUNTRY HERE FROM YOUR OWN 
SPECIALIST POLITICAL REPORTERS A 
COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO IT DIDN'T 
ACTUALLY WORK L. AM GOING TO TRY 
AGAIN GOODBYE JOIN US IN A COUPLE 
OF MINUTES 
I KNOW THAT TESSA JOWELL DOESN'T 
THINK 
UP IT HAS TAKEN ON A THINK NATIONAL STATUS CERTAINLY A 
NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE WHAT ABOUT 
THE WIDER EFFECTS THAT THEY ARE 
HAVING ON THE CONFIDENCE OF THE 
PARTY'S OVERALL LET'S TALK TO 
MICHAEL PORTILLO ABOUT THAT NOW 
MICHAEL BORIS HAS BECOME TOTEMIC 
FOR THE TORIES IF HE DOESN'T WIN 
IT SUGGESTS THAT THE TORIES HAVE 
NOT REALLY PICKED UP 
THEY WANT TO 
DO VERY WELL IN LONDON THEY NEED 
TO WIN THE THEY ARE BACKING A 
CANDIDATE WHO IS IN MANY WAYS A 
IN EMBARRASSMENT TO THEM IF THEY 
WIN THE TORIES ARE GOING TO BEAT 
HOLDING THEIR BREATH 
DO YOU THINK 
THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO FEARED 
HIM MORE THAN LABOUR M. P.'S WAS TORY 
M. P.'S 
ABSOLUTELY THE TORIES MADE A M. P.'S VERY GOOD THIS DURING THE ELECTION 
OF PRETENDING THAT EVERYTHING IS 
ALL RIGHT WITH BORIS THIS IS THE 
MAN THAT DAVID CAMERON SACKED FROM 
THE SHADOW CABINET HE HAS MADE A 
NUMBER OF DEATHS IT WAS BY NO 
MEANS THEIR FIRST CHOICE THERE 
WILL STILL BE WONDERING WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN GAFFES IT IS A CURIOUS 
ELECTION LABOUR ARE DESPERATE TO 
WIN WITH A CANDIDATE WHO HORRIFIES 
THEM 
POLLY THAT IS THE POINT THEM INESSA SINCE WE SEE THE PHOTO OPS 
WITH GORDON BROWN AND KENNER OVER 
THE LAST FEW DAYS BUT WE KNOW 
THERE IS A DEEP UNEASE ASTONISHING ASTONISHING BATTLES OVER THE TUBE AND WHAT ELSE 
NOW THEY NEED EACH OTHER THEY ARE 
BOUND TOGETHER KEN HAS BEEN GLAD 
TO HAVE GORDON BROWN CAMPAIGNING 
WITH HIM WHETHER IT WAS A GOOD 
IDEA OR NOT I AM NOT SURE ON THE 
OTHER HAND HE IS AFRAID THAT HE 
WILL GO DOWN BECAUSE LABOUR GOES 
DOWN RATHER THAN HIS OWN 
POPULARITY 
IF KEN DOES NOT GET IT POPULARITY IS THAT THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF 
GORDON BROWN 
IT IS A LONG TIME 
UNTIL AN ELECTION FOUR YEARS AGO 
LABOUR ONLY GOT TWENTY SIX PER CENT AND CAME THIRD 
A YEAR LATER THEY WON THE ELECTION 
THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A 
CONNECTION 
HAS LONDON INFLUENCED CONNECTION THE WIDER POLITICS OR HAS THE 
PARTY'S POSITION INFLUENCED WHAT WE 
ARE SEEING IN THE MAYORAL RACE 
THERE IS NO GETTING AWAY FROM THE 
FACT THAT THE NATIONAL POSITION OF 
LABOUR IT'S TERRIBLE POSITION IN 
THE POLLS IS DRAG ON KEN 
LIVINGSTONE BUT HE IS ALMOST THE 
ULTIMATE NON NATIONAL VISIBLE 
POLITICAL GROUND IN LOCAL AND 
REGIONAL POLITICS HE CAN HOLD OUT 
FOR A LONG WAY AGAINST AN UNPOPULAR 
PARTY IF HE DID THAT HE WOULD 
BECOME AN INFLUENCE ON NATIONAL 
POLITICS BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE 
GIVEN GORDON BROWN SOMETHING THAT 
GORDON BROWN CANNOT GET ANYWHERE 
ELSE WINNING AN ELECTION PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE NOW STARTING TO TALK ABOUT THIS 
DIVINE RIGHT OF KEN IF YOU LIKE 
THIS IDEA THAT BECAUSE HE IS THE 
INCUMBENT AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON 
HOW MANY TIMES HE CAN STAND IT 
LOOKS LIKE HE IS NOT GOING AND IT 
IS MAKING PEOPLE NERVOUS MIGHT 
THAT BE CREATING A SHIFT 
IT IS A 
POWERFUL ARGUMENT THERE IS NO 
QUESTION THAT THE BRITISH FOR GOOD 
REASONS DO NOT LIKE POWERFUL 
POLITICAL LEADERS WHO HANG AROUND 
TOO LONG ON THE OTHER HAND AS WE 
HAVE JUST HEARD THE CONSERVATIVES 
HAVE GONE ON WITH A CHALLENGING 
CANDIDATE AS KEN HAS ALREADY WORTH 
A FEW POINTS YOU AT THE TWO 
TOGETHER AND IT COULD GIVE THE 
LABOUR PARTY IN LONDON A BETTER 
CHANCE THAN EVER HOPED FOR GIVEN 
THE POSITION THEY ARE IN THAT IS 
WHY IT HAS BEEN SUCH A DIFFICULT 
PLACE TO WORK OUT WHAT THE RESULT 
WILL BE 
OF COURSE WE HAVE NOT GONE ON TO 
SECOND PREFERENCE WHICH COULD HAVE 
A BIG INFLUENCE WE WILL WAIT TO 
BRING YOU THAT RESULT 
SO WE HAVE HAD RESULTS FROM HULL 
AND FROM WEST LINDSEY WE WILL GO 
OVER TO HIM TO HEAR ABOUT THOSE 
WHEREAS WEST LINDSEY WE DON'T HAVE 
HULL WE HAVE LOST IT 
WEST LINDSEY IS A CONSERVATIVE GAIN 
FROM THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
THEY HAVE GAINED FIVE SEATS THEY 
ONLY NEEDED TO GAIN ONE 
AFTER THE 
DEFECTION BUT FIVE IS VERY GOOD 
INDEED 
WE HAVE NOSELEY ALMEIDA INDEED HOLD ON TO THAT LABOUR 
THE CONSERVATIVES GAIN FIVE THIS IS A 
SERIOUS LABOUR HEARTLAND LABOUR 
ARE DOWN FIVE COUNCILLORS THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE UP OVERALL FIVE 
THAT WILL WARM THE HEARTS OF THE 
TORIES GEORGE 
CAN I SAY SOMETHING ABOUT GEORGE THE SUNDERLAND RESULT AND THE 
TAMESIDE RESULTED GREATER 
MANCHESTER THERE IS ALWAYS THIS 
ARGUMENT THAT THE CONSERVATIVES 
CANNOT WIN IN THE NORTH THERE IS 
SUNDERLAND AND TAMESIDE IN GREATER 
MANCHESTER WHERE WE HAVE GAINED 
SEATS OF LABOUR IF YOU LOOK ACROSS 
THE NORTH WE ARE DOING EXTREMELY 
WELL THERE ARE MORE COUNCILS WITH 
NO LABOUR REPRESENTATION AT ALL 
THAN THERE ARE COUNCILS WITH NO 
CONSERVATIVE REPRESENTATION 
THINK THAT IS A GOOD SIGN THAT 
WE'LL WIN IN PLACES LIKE SUNDERLAND 
WE TOOK OUR SPRING CONFERENCE TO 
GATESHEAD AND HAD A GREAT 
CONFERENCE IN THE NORTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO 
JEREMY ARE YOU THERE AND DO YOU 
HAVE SOMETHING FOR US 
SOMETHING FOR YOU TO GET YOUR TEETH 
INTO IN THE STUDIO THIS IS A POLL 
THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH I. C. M. THIS IS 
THE OVERARCHING QUESTION 
WHAT I AM GOING TO DO WE SHOW YOU 
THE RESULTS FROM LAST YEAR SAY YOU 
HAVE A COMPARISON IT MAKES 
INTERESTING READING THE FIRST ONE 
WAS CAN BE TRUSTED TO RUN 
BRITAIN'S ECONOMY 
FORTY EIGHT PER CENT SAID LABOUR FORTY SIX CONSERVATIVES 
THIRTY THREE THE LIB DEMS SO LABOUR STILL 
HEAD OF THE CONSERVATIVES LAST YEAR 
MOVING ON A YEAR TO THIS YEAR LOOK 
A VERY SHARP FALL FOR LABOUR AND 
THE CONSERVATIVES THERE HAVE ALSO 
FALLEN MAYBE BECAUSE OF GENERAL 
ECONOMIC WOE BUT THEY HAVE PULLED 
PAST LABOUR THE NEXT QUESTION WAS 
THIS WHICH PARTY HAS A GOOD TEAM 
OF LEADERS 
FORTY THREE PER CENT SAID LABOUR IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THIRTY SIX PER CENT 
CONSERVATIVE THIRTY TWO PER CENT LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 
THAT WAS UNDER THE TONY BLAIR 
LEADERSHIP WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE 
PULL IT FORWARD TO THE BROWN 
PREMIERSHIP IT DROPS SUBSTANTIALLY 
YOU CAN SEE THE CONSERVATIVES 
COMING UP PAST LABOUR IN THAT 
QUESTION AS WELL IN THE ECONOMY 
AND A GOOD TEAM OF LEADERS 
CONSERVATIVES ARE AHEAD OF LEADER 
LABOUR LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS 
DROPPING AS WELL THE LIB DEMS 
DROPPING QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY THE 
NEXT QUESTION WAS THIS AGAIN WE 
ASKED WHICH OF THEM IS A DIVIDED 
PARTY 
QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT 
LABOUR WAS DIVIDED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THIRTY SIX PER CENT 
SAID THE CONSERVATIVES TWENTY FIVE PER CENT SAID 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WELL AND 
MADE A LOOK AT IT LESS DIVIDED NOW 
WE COULD HAVE A CHAT ABOUT THAT IN 
THE STUDIO THE CONSERVATIVES A 
LITTLE BIT LESS DIVIDED THE LIB 
DEMS ROUGHLY WHERE THEY WERE THE 
NEXT QUESTION WE ASKED WAS THIS 
KIT WAS ON THE N. H. S. AGAIN WITH 
REFERENCE TO A QUESTION LAST YEAR 
WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THESE QUESTIONS 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO 
THE SIGNIFICANCE FOR US LAST YEAR 
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS POLL WAS 
THAT THE CONSERVATIVES HAD PULLED 
SUBSTANTIALLY PAST THE LABOUR PARTY 
IN THAT PARTICULAR POLL LAST YEAR 
ON THAT QUESTION WATCH WHAT 
HAPPENS NOW IF I SHOW YOU THE 
ANSWERS THIS YEAR LABOUR ARE A 
LITTLE BIT ON THE N. H. S. THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE DOWN THEY HAVE 
FALLEN BEHIND LABOUR THE LIB DEMS 
ALSO FOR CHARLES KENNEDY IN THE 
STUDIO SOME WORRYING FIGURES SOME 
QUITE SHARP DROPS THIS WAS ONE 
WHICH HAS A BEARING ON THE WHOLE TEN 
PENCE TAX MESS WE ONLY ASKED IT 
THIS YEAR WHICH IS THE PARTY THAT 
HAS THE RIGHT POLICIES FOR THOSE ON 
A LOW INCOME 
SO LABOUR WHATEVER HAS GONE WRONG 
ON THAT WHOLE ISSUE CAN ACTUALLY 
SAY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ECLIPSED ON 
THE WHOLE POVERTY AGENDA BY THE 
OPPOSITION RIGHT WE ASKED NOW 
ABOUT INDIVIDUALS ARE THE 
FOLLOWING POLITICIANS AN ASSET OR 
LIABILITY WE HAVE THREE FOR YOU 
LET'S DO THE PRIME MINISTER FIRST 
OF ALL GORDON BROWN ASSET OR 
LIABILITY LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE 
STATISTICS 
SO SUBSTANTIALLY MORE PEOPLE 
THINKING THAT MR. BROWN IS DOING 
MORE HARM THAN GOOD FOR HIS PARTY 
THE NEXT ONE IS HAVE A GUESS 
TONY BLAIR WE THOUGHT WE WOULD PUT 
HIM INTO THIS TO GET A COMPARISON 
A BETTER SCORE THAN THE MAN WHO 
FOLLOWED HIM ARE FOLLOWING 
POLITICIAN AND THE LAST QUESTION 
FOR YOU THE MOMENT DAVID 
CAMERON ASSET OR LIABILITY WATCH 
THIS ONE IF YOU ARE MR. CAMERON 
LOOKING AT JUST EURO AND PERSONAL 
LEADERSHIP POSITION THAT IS VERY 
GOOD NEWS YOUR OWN 
LET'S GO TO NUNEATON AND JOINED 
JOAN WHO HAS INFORMATION FROM 
THEIR 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT WE THEIR HAVE HAD A HISTORY MADE TONIGHT 
LABOUR HAVE LOST CONTROL NUNEATON 
AND BEDWORTH HAS TURNED BLUE THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE GOT THE GAMES 
THAT THEY WANTED THEY HAVE TAKEN 
CONTROL OF THIS TRADITIONAL LABOUR 
STRONGHOLD I HAVE TO ALSO SAY THAT 
THE B. N. P. WHO CANVASSED TWELVE 
CANDIDATES ALSO GAINED TWO SEATS 
TONIGHT THE FEELING HERE IS THAT 
THIS IS A TIDE TURNING L. SPOKE TO 
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER WHO IS NOW 
GOING TO BE THE LEADER OF THE 
COUNCIL HE SAID THAT PEOPLE WERE 
BASICALLY JUST TIRED OF WHAT WAS 
GOING ON IN LONDON THEY WANTED A 
CHANGE THEY ALSO TIRED OF WHAT WAS 
GOING ON ON THEIR DOORSTEPS HE 
FELT THEY WERE REPRESENTING A FRESH 
CHANGE INDEED THAT IS WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED THE LABOUR LEADER IS NOW 
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION AFTER 
THIRTY FOUR YEARS NUNEATON AND BEDWORTH 
COUNCIL IS UNDER CONSERVATIVE 
CONTROL CONTROL WELL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT 
WELL THIS IS VERY CLEARLY MANY 
SIN IS A COUNCIL THAT HAS BEEN 
LABOUR FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
NUNEATON IT TOOK A CHANGE OF THREE 
SEATS TO LOSE OVERALL CONTROL TO 
WHAT EXTENT THIS HAS BEEN 
DETERMINED BY A NATIONAL TREND AS 
OPPOSED TO LOCAL FACTORS IS 
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE 
IS IT A 
BADLY RUN COUNCIL BY LABOUR IT HAS 
BEEN LAID THIS IS THE SEVENTIES HASN'T 
IT 
OR A VERY LONG TIME YES YOU IT WERE MAKING THE DISTINCTION EARLIER 
IN THIS PROGRAMME ABOUT FEELINGS 
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT AND GORDON 
BROWN AS OPPOSE TO WHAT HAPPENED 
LOCALLY AND WILL WARNING THAT WHAT 
HAPPENED LOCALLY IS JUST AS 
IMPORTANT 
ARE YOU SAYING IT WAS A LABOUR 
PARTY THAT LET YOU DOWN 
I DON'T 
KNOW HOW PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN 
NUNEATON EXPERIENCE THE SERVICES OF 
THE LOCAL COUNCIL BUT I THINK 
WHETHER YOU HAVE THAT SORT OF 
INCUMBENCY FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS CAN GIVE 
RISE TO A SENSE THAT THE COUNCIL IS 
COMPLACENT AND SO FORTH IT IS A 
PITY THAT WE HAVE LOST CONTROL BUT 
NO DOUBT LOCAL FACTORS HAVE PLAYED 
A PART 
NUNEATON HOW MANY SEATS DID SHIFT 
NO WE DON'T 
THE LOSS OF THREE 
SEATS WOULD HAVE LOST 
WE MUST BE 
CLEAR RIGHT NOW THIS IS GOING TO 
BE A VERY BAD NIGHT FOR LABOUR 
INDEED THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW 
BAD IT IS POSSIBLE AT THE END OF 
THE NIGHT WHEN WE EVENTUALLY SEE 
THE ESTIMATED NATIONAL SHARE OF THE 
VOTE WE WILL SEE LABOUR GOING DOWN 
BELOW WHAT THEY WERE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THAT 
WAS PRETTY AWFUL WE SHOULD BE 
QUITE CLEAR ABOUT THAT THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS ARE PICKING UP FROM 
LABOUR EVEN WHILE LOSING TO THE 
CONSERVATIVES AND OF COURSE WE SEE 
LABOUR VOTERS SWITCHING TO THE 
AWFUL I 
TORIES IT'S GOING TO BE AWFUL I DON'T 
CAN GET AWAY FROM THAT 
FRPLTS WORSE THAN TONY BLAIR 
STRAIGHT AFTER THE IRAQ WAR WHEN IT 
WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NO WEAPONS 
OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND PEOPLE WERE 
TIRED OF HIM WE SEE WHEN WE LOOK 
AT INDIVIDUAL RESULTS HOW SOME 
DON'T LOOK GOOD FOR TORIES OTHERS 
DO LOOK GOOD WE STARTED OFF WITH 
CHELTENHAM AND WORCESTER WHICH WILL 
BE DISAPPOINTING TO THEM IF THEY 
WISH TO WIN THE SEATS HARLOW IN 
ESSEX AND NOW NUNEATON MUCH 
BETTER NEWS FOR THEM A BUILDING 
BLOCK FOR THEM TO GET THOSE SEATS 
WE WILL GO 
THROUGH THE MAGIC OF 
E. MAIL THAT COMES ACROSS FROM A 
CONSERVATIVE SOURCE THROUGH HERE 
NOT FROM THE MAN IN THE STUDIO 
THEY ARE PREDICTING NOW TWO HUNDRED 
COUNCILORS GAINED 
YOU ARE WILLING TO GO ALONG WITH 
THAT THAT IS WHAT ERIC PICKLES WAS 
SAYING 
I DON'T 
HAVE AN E. MAIL I SAYING HAVE A SHEET OF PAPER IT SAYS WE 
ARE PREDICTING TWO HUNDRED GAINS WE WILL 
WAIT TO SEEFPLT IT IS TURNING OUT 
TO BE A GOOD NIGHT FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES WINNING ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
OUR VOTE SHARE MAY BE UP WE ARE 
GAINING CONTROLS OF LOTS OF COUNCIL 
OFF A DIFFICULT BASE FOR US IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
WHERE EVERYONE INCLUDING THE B. B. C. 
WAS SAYING IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO 
MAIN GAINS TONIGHT FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL 
BE A VERY GOOD NIGHT 
WE SAID YOU 
DID WELL IN TWO HUNDRED FOUR AND IT WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT 
THAT SOUNDS ALL RIGHT DIFFICULT FOR ME DO EVEN BETTER 
WE HAVE 
ONLY HAD NINETEEN OUT OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY COUNCIL 
RESULTS IN THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET 
THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO LET'S 
JOIN EMILY I'M JOINED BY JOHN 
CULLSHAW A MAN NO STRANGER TO 
POLITICS HE STARTED LIFE AS 
SPITTING IMAGE BEST KNOWN WITH DEAD 
RINGERS SITTING HERE IN THE LONDON 
LIVING ROOM OF CITY HALL KEN'S 
SPIRITUAL HOME FOR THE LAST EIGHT 
YEARS WHAT DO YOU THINK BORIS 
WOULD DO IF HE GOT IT 
HE WOULD RUN 
INTO HERE AND CELEBRATE ON A UNION 
CYCLE AND BE JOLLY EXCITED AND 
THINK HERE WE ARE IT IS 
INTERESTING WATCHING HOW THE TONE 
OF BORIS CHANGED THROUGH HIS 
CAMPAIGN THERE WAS MUCH MORE OF 
FAMOUS JOLTY AND THERE SEEMED TO BE 
TAPING POINT HE THOUGHT GOING TO 
CHANGE NOW AND BE A LITTLE MORE 
SERIOUS BORIS MEANS BUSINESS THAT 
SORT OF TONE THERE WAS A 
MEANDERING AS THE CAMPAIGN WENT ON 
YES I THINK HE WILL RUN IN HERE 
AND CELEBRATE 
ONE OF THE 
COMMENTATORS WAS SAYING THE 
QUESTION WILL NOT BE IF IT WILL BE 
BAD FOR LABOUR TONIGHT BUT HOW BAD 
IT WILL BE WHAT KIND OF A NIGHT DO 
YOU IMAGINE GORDON BROWN IS HAVING 
THIS IS THE FIRST TEST HE WILL BE 
VERY NERVOUS YOU SAW THAT NERVOUS 
SMILE WAS THERE HE WILL BE GETING 
TOGETHER A FEW OF THOSE CATCH 
PHRASES 
WHAT ARE YOUR FAIV RAID PHRASES BROWN PHRASES 
HE USES I'M GETTING 
ON WITH THE JOB THAT'S THE 
IMPORTANT THING 
HE FEELS THAT 
SHADOW OF TONY BLAIR OVER HIS 
SHOULDER 
PROBABLE AT THIS STAGE 
PROBABLY AT THIS STAGE L. THINK 
BLAIR USED DIFFERENT CATCH PHRASES 
TO BAT AWAY TROUBLE HE WOULD SAY 
LOOK WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS IT 
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER HE 
WOULD GO EARNEST AND CHANGE HIS 
BODY LANGUAGE AND SPEAK FROM THE 
HEART LIKE THAT GORDON WOULD SAY 
HE IS MORE INTROSPECTIVE MORE OF A 
SENSE OF NERVOUSNESS I SUPPOSE WITH 
GORDON 
THINKING WE HAVE BEEN GORDON ARRIVE VITED BY THE U. S. ELECTIONS 
THE LAST FIVE MONTHS OR MORE DO 
YOU THINK THAT BUSH AND HIS LOT ARE 
SITTING THERE WATCHING THE WOLF VER 
HAMPTON PRIMARIES AND THE SHEFFIELD 
CAUCUSES AND THINKING WHICH WAY IT 
IS WILL SWING 
THEY OUGHT TO BE 
ARE THEY IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE 
GEORGE BUSH IS GOING THIS IS 
REALLY COOL THIS IS REALLY NEAT 
GOOD LUCK TO CHARLIE BROWN A A LITTLE BIT OF CAMERON WE HAVEN'T 
TALKED ABOUT CAMERON HE COULD BE 
VERY NERVOUS AT BORIS BEING IN OR 
VERY NERVOUS OF HIM NOT BEING IN 
INDEED UP UNTIL NOW I'VE NEVER 
STUDIED DAVID CAMERON AS A VOICE AS 
A CHARACTER NEVER PUT HIM UNDER 
THE MICROSCOPE THERE IS A GROWING 
FEELING WE MAY HAVE TO NOW 
JUST GET THE SENSE OF THAT YOU 
JOLLY SCOUT MASTER EAGER TO PLEASE 
GET OUT MORE OF THOSE RATHER POSHER 
ETON 
INTERESTING KEN ETON LIVINGSTONE IS VERY MUCH A PART OF 
LONDON LIFE ISN'T HE COULDN'T 
ACTUALLY IMAGINE A LONDON WITHOUT 
KEN HE HAS BEEN SO MUCH PART OF 
LONDON'S POLITICAL HISTORY EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY YOU SORT OF IMAGINE WHAT THE 
CONTRASTS WOULD BE IF BORIS WERE TO 
TAKE IT 
WOULD HE MARK OUT THE CONGESTION 
CHARGE ZONE WITH A CIRCLE OF 
SAUSAGES 
YOU ARE IMAGINING SOME SAUSAGES SORT OF FRIENDLY SCOUT MASTER I I SUPPOSE SO IT WILL BE INTRIGUING 
TO SEE WHAT THE CONTRASTS WOULD BE 
YES CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO WATCH 
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEAR FS IT GOES 
THAT WAY O. K. 
EVERYONE MAKING O. K. PREDICTIONS AT THE MOMENT IT COULD 
GO ANY WAY 
I WOULDN'T ASK YOU FOR 
PREDICTIONS YOU HAVE DONE PLENTY 
JOHN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
BACK TO YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW THE COUNT 
SOMETHING GOING ON ALL OVER THE 
PLACE STILL SOME MORE ACTUAL 
RESULTS IN 
WE WILL SEE 
THOSE NUNEATON AND 
WE WILL SEE THOSE NUNEATON AND BEDWORTH BEDWORTH LABOUR DOWN SIX CONSERVATIVES UP 
FOUR B. N. P. INTERESTINGLY GET TWO 
SEATS HARLOW AGAIN A CONSERVATIVE 
GAIN FROM NO OVER ALL CONTROL 
CONSERVATIVES ON EIGHTEEN UP FIVE 
LABOUR PARTY DOWN FOUR OTHERS DOWN 
ONE ROCHDALE A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 
HOLD THIRTY THREE FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
THEY ARE UP ONE LABOUR DOWN ONE 
AND THE CONSERVATIVES NO CHANGE 
SO 
WHO'S TURN IS IT REALLY YOURS 
GEORGE OSBOURNE 
I WAS SAYING IT IS 
A GOOD NIGHT THE FACT WE ARE 
WINNING IN PLACES LIKE NUNEATON AND 
HOR LOW IS IMPORTANT FOR US THIS 
IS A TRULY SHOCKING NIGHT FOR 
LABOUR I MEAN REMEMBER GORDON 
BROWN'S PEOPLE A YEAR AGO WHEN 
THERE WAS THAT ROW ABOUT WHO WILL 
BE THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY 
THEY WERE SAYING IF GORDON BROWN 
WAS IN CHARGE WE WOULDN'T HAVE 
PROBLEMS AT LOCAL ELECTIONS THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS TONY BLAIR'S FAULT 
ARE TERRIBLE GORDON BROWN IS IN 
CHARGE HIS FIRST ELECTORAL TEST 
HE IS A NON ELECTED PRIME MINISTER 
IT IS TURNING OUT TO BE IN THE 
LOCAL ELECTION AS BAD NIGHT FOR HIM 
HE IS GOING TO HAVE EXPLAINING TO 
DO 
WHAT WE NEED TO BEAR IN MIND DO THERE IS FOCUS ON HOW WELL THE 
TORIES ARE DOING AND HOW WELL 
LABOUR IS DOING WHAT MATTERS IS 
THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO PEOPLE 
KEEP SAYING THE CONSERVATIVES NEED 
FORTY PER CENT TO WIN WELL IT ALL DEPENDS ON 
HOW BADLY OR WELL LABOUR IS DOING 
PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN 
ALREADY THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE ELECTION THE 
LABOUR PARTY GOT ONLY THIRTY SIX PER CENT OF THE 
POPULAR VOTE BECAUSE IT WAS FAR 
ENOUGH AHEAD OF THE TORIES THE 
LABOUR PARTY WON THE ELECTION WHEN WHEN YOU SAID THIS WAS GOING TO BE A 
CATASTROPHIC NIGHT FOR LABOUR ARE 
YOU ROWING BACK FROM THAT 
NOT AT 
ALL I'M MICKING THE POINT IF IT'S 
A CATASTROPHIC YOU NIGHT FOR LABOUR 
AND AS WE SUSPECT A PRETTY GOOD 
NIGHT FOR THE CONSERVATION BUT A 
HUGE BYE BETTER NIGHT THAT TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE GAP BETWEEN THE PARTIES 
WILL BE A HARDER AND HARDER GAP FOR 
THE LABOUR PARTY TO MAKE UP IN THE 
TIME AVAILABLE THAT IS ALL I'M 
SAYING 
WHERE DO YOU FIT THE SAYING LIBERAL DEMOCRATS INTO THIS 
PICTURE 
WE ARE TALKING NOW ABOUT PICTURE FORMING THE NEXT GOVERNMENT THAT 
IS THE POINT ONE WAS MAKING THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS APPEAR 
IT COULD 
BE CRITICAL IN THAT 
FINDING SO R. 
TO BE DOING THE LABOUR PARTY A 
GREAT DEAL OF HARM THE REASON THEY 
ARE DOING THAT IS THAT THEY ARE 
LOSING VOTES TO THE CONSERVATIVES 
WHICH PUT THE CONSERVATIVES IN A 
BETTER POSITION THEY ARE ACTUALLY 
TAKING VOTES FROM LABOUR AS WE HAVE 
BEEN SEEING IN COUNCIL AFTER 
COUNCIL THAT IS VERY BAD NEWS FROM 
THE LABOUR PARTY'S POINT OF VIEW 
CAN I SAY DO THINK THERE IS A 
LIMIT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN 
GENERALISE FROM THESE RESULTS 
COUNCIL BY COUNCIL TO THE LIKELY 
RESULT OF GENERAL ELECTION NEXT 
YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER MEAN OF 
COURSE YOU KNOW THESE SO FAR YOU 
KNOW ARE NOT GREAT RESULTS FOR US 
PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND FOR 
DIFFERENT REASONS ARE COMMUNICATING 
VERY CLEARLY THEIR UNEASE THE 
ECONOMY HAS BEEN DIFFICULT PEOPLE 
FEEL THAT THEY ARE HURTING THEY 
FEEL UNDER PRESSURE AND THEY FEEL 
ANXIOUS ABOUT THEIR OWN FUTURE 
SO THAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY A FACTOR IN 
THIS THE QUESTION IS THE QUESTION 
IS WHICH PARTY WHICH LEADER IS 
BEST QUIPPED TO GUIDE THE COUNTRY 
THROUGH THIS 
ISN'T THIS GOING TO 
BE PRECISELY THE RESULT THAT 
DAMAGES GORDON BROWN EVEN MORE WE 
SAW A MOMENTING A IN THE OPINION 
POLLS HIS REPUTATION OF THE DIVIDED 
PARTY ALL THE THINGS THE PUBLIC 
THINK ABOUT THE PARTY THIS IS NOT 
GOING TO IMPROVE THINGS THE THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE WHERE WE 
WERE BEHIND OTHER PARTIES THE THE ECONOMY THE TORIES AHEAD FOR THE 
FIRST TIME 
THAT IS NOT SURPRISING 
REALLY 
TZ NOT SURPRISING 
THE MAN REALLY WHO HAS BEEN THE CHANCELLOR OF THE 
EXCHEQUER FOR ELEVEN YEARS 
IT IS NOT 
SURPRISING GIVEN THE TURBULENCE IN

WE WILL SHOOT THE CAN AND SEE THE

HE IS IN TROUBLE OR NOT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT LET'S GO BACK TO THE HARD STUFF 
THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO PUT IT 
TIM IN LINCOLN 
THAT WORD IS GOING TO BE BANDIED 
ABOUT WITH LABOUR AGAIN MELTDOWN 
LET'S SEE HOW THE LABOUR SUPPORT 
HAS EVAPORATED IN THIS PART OF THE 
WORLD THE TORIES HAVE HELD A 
LINCOLN THEY WON IT LAST YEAR FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS BACK IN 
THE NINETEEN NINETIES AT THE HEIGHT OF THE 
UNPOPULARITY WITH THE JOHN MAJOR 
GOVERNMENT LABOUR HELD ALL THIRTY THREE 
SEATS HERE THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE 
TORY IN LINCOLN LOOK AT HULL BACK 
IN THE NINETIES FIFTY EIGHT OUT OF FIFTY NINE COUNCIL 
SEATS IN HULL WERE LAID BARE THEY 
HAVE DONE NOTHING BETTER NIGHT THE 
LIB DEMS WITH A CLEAR MAJORITY IN 
HULL 
WE 
HAVE NEWS THAT THE TORIES HULL HAVE GAINED SOUTHAMPTON THEY 
NEEDED SEVEN I THINK TO GAIN IT 
FROM NO OVERALL CONTROL 
THAT WAS 
NOT ON MY LIST OF TOWNS THAT I 
THOUGHT THE TORIES WOULD BE LIKELY 
TO WIN THEY GAINED FOUR SEATS FROM 
LABOUR THREE FROM THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS ONE FROM THE OTHERS 
THAT IS A SENSATIONAL VICTORY FROM 
THE CONSERVATIVE'S POINT OF VIEW 
THEY SHOULD BE VERY PLEASED 
REMEMBER THE TORIES USED TO HOLD 
PARLIAMENTARY SEATS BUT JOHN 
DENHAM HIS MAJORITY IS AROUND 
NINE THOUSAND YOU WOULD NOT PUT THAT IN 
YOUR LIST OF MARGINALS WE'RE NOT 
SAYING THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU TAKE A 
COUNCIL YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE THE 
SEAT BUT AGAIN WHAT WE KEEP 
REPEATING IT IS BUILDING BLOCK 
IT IS ONE THEY DID NOT EXPECT TO DO 
FRANKLY WE DIDN'T EXPECT IT EITHER 
TWO MORE CONSERVATIVE GAME COUNCILS 
THIS IS SOUTHAMPTON THAT WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT 
ELMBRIDGE ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE 
GAIN THAT IS FROM NO OVERALL 
CONTROL THE RATEPAYERS ASSOCIATION 
I ASSUME THAT IS 
A FOOTNOTE IT IS 
WORTH REMEMBERING THAT JOHN DENHAM 
IS THE MINISTER WHO BOTH IN 
GOVERNMENT AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT 
BEFORE WARNED HIS PARTY ABOUT THE 
NEED TO HOLD ON TO THE SOUTHERN 
VOTERS TONY BLAIR WAS SO 
SUCCESSFUL IN GAINING THEM 
THE DAMAGE IN SOUTHAMPTON WILL FUEL 
HIM AND OTHERS SAYING TO GORDON 
BROWN YOU CANNOT TAKE THESE PEOPLE 
FOR GRANTED THIS IS VERY SERIOUS 
INDEED AND SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE 
TO REASSURE THEM 
HOW DO YOU GET 
THEM BACK 
I DON'T THINK THAT 
ANYBODY COULD SUGGEST THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS TAKING PEOPLE FOR 
GRANTED NOR DOES ANY ONE 
UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF 
MAINTAINING SUPPORT RIGHT 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY CHARLES CHARLES CLARKE THINKS YOU ARE TAKING PEOPLE 
FOR GRANTED DOESN'T HE 
I DON'T 
AGREE WITH CHARLES 
YOU SAY THAT 
NOBODY SAYS IT CHARLES CLARKE AS A 
SENIOR MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT HE HE WAS INDEED BUT MAKING IT CLEAR 
THAT WE DON'T TAKE PEOPLE FOR 
GRANTED IN CONDUCTING AN 
ASSESSMENT OF THE RESULTS TONIGHT 
WITH DUE HUMILITY AND UNDERSTANDING 
WHERE PEOPLE ARE SENDING A CLEAR 
MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT WHAT 
THAT MESSAGES AS OPPOSE TO VOTING 
IN RELATION TO SPECIFIC LOCAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES OF COURSE THAT WILL 
FOLLOW 
BEFORE THESE RESULTS CAME FOLLOW IN JOHN DENHAM GAVE A SPEECH HE 
WAS NOT CRITICAL OF HIS LEADER OF 
COURSE BUT HE WARNED HIS PARTY OF 
THE NEED TO DO MORE TO HOLD ON TO 
THOSE VOTERS IN THE SOUTH OF 
ENGLAND WHAT THESE RESULTS ARE 
LIKELY TO DO IS FUEL THAT SORT OF 
DEBATE WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR 
THE PARTY TO HOLD ON TO THOSE 
VOTERS WE HEARD THE GENERAL 
SECRETARY OF THE FABIAN SOCIETY 
TALKING ABOUT IT THE DIFFICULTY 
THAT POSES FOR ANY PARTY IN 
GOVERNMENT IS IF YOU HAVE COMPETING 
VISIONS ON HOW TO DO THAT THERE 
WILL BE AN ARGUMENT I THINK THAT 
WILL TAKE PLACE ABOUT WHAT TO DO 
SOME BELIEVE IT IS ABOUT RETURNING 
TO COURT BOATS AND REASSURING THE 
CORE VOTES SOME PEOPLE IN THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND MAY ARGUE THAT 
OTHERS IN THE SOUTH SAY THE BLAIR 
FORMULA OF BEING IN THE CENTRE IS 
MORE IMPORTANT THOSE ARE HARDER TO 
RECONCILE WHEN YOU HAVE NO MONEY TO 
SPEND 
LET'S JOIN CLYDE LEWIS IN SPEND COLCHESTER CAN YOU HEAR US HE 
CAN'T YES 
TELL US WHAT HAS BEEN CAN'T YES GOING ON THERE 
CAN YOU SAY THAT 
ONCE MORE FOR ME 
WHAT HAVE YOU 
BEEN FOLLOWING WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
IN COLCHESTER 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
COLCHESTER WHAT WE DO KNOW 
HAPPENED IN COLCHESTER IS THAT THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE CURRENTLY IN 
CONTROL THEY ARE EXPECTING TO TAKE 
THIS COUNCIL TO HOLD ON TO THE 
COUNCIL THE LIB DEMS ARE FIGHTING 
FOR THEM IN THE LAST LOCAL 
ELECTIONS TWO LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
CONFECTED TO THE CONSERVATIVES NOW 
THEY ARE TRIED TO HOLD ON TO 
CONTROL THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE 
PUTTING UP A FIGHT WE WILL KNOW 
PRETTY SHORTLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
HARLOW HAVE YOU BEEN FOLLOWING 
THAT AS WELL 
THAT IS A GOOD 
SUCCESS STORY FOR THE CONSERVATIVES 
NOT UNEXPECTED BUT A GOOD WIN IT 
IS NOT AS SOLIDLY LABOUR IT HAS 
SWUNG BACK AND FORWARD THERE HAVE 
BEEN SOME KEY ISSUES LOCAL AND 
NATIONAL THEY HAVE HAD THE 
STANSTED EXPANSION WHICH HAS BEEN 
HUGELY UNPOPULAR A NUMBER OF 
HOUSING PROJECTS HAVE BEEN PLANNED 
FOR THEIR EXTREMELY UNPOPULAR ON 
THE NATIONAL SCENE THERE HAS BEEN 
THE TEN PENCE INCOME CAPS TAX 
CHANGES THAT HAS PROVED EXTREMELY 
UNPOPULAR IN HARLOW IT IS ALSO 
WORTH MENTIONING THAT A LOT OF 
MONEY HAS BEEN PUMPED INTO HARLOW 
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST MARGINAL IN 
CONSTITUENCY TERMS THE EDUCATION 
MINISTER HAS A MAJORITY OF JUST NINETY SEVEN 
IT WAS LOOKING A LITTLE BIT DODGY 
FOR LABOUR IN THE FIRST PLACE 
BEFORE IT EVEN HAPPENED 
WE CAN 
REJOIN EMILY MAITLIS WHO HAS THE 
ACTIVIST BLOGGERS TO REPORT THINGS THINGS ARE HOTTING UP IN BLOG LAND WE 
HAVE PROMISED TO BRING YOU THE 
RESULTS BEFORE YOU BRING THEM 
LET'S SEE HOW OUR BLOGGERS ARE 
DOING IAN YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT 
YOU ARE FEELING TORY REVIVAL BUT 
SO FAR IN THE SOUTH 
NOT AT ALL 
THEY HAVE GAINED SIX SEATS IN 
SUNDERLAND A FEW YEARS AGO THAT 
WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE WHAT THE 
PARTIES WILL BE DOING TONIGHT IS 
LOOKING AT THE MARGINAL SEATS BOB 
KEY INDICATIONS ON WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN THE GENERAL ELECTION 
SEATS LIKE EXETER BEN BRADSHAW'S 
SEAT WHERE LABOUR ARE NOW IN THIRD 
PLACE IN NORWICH THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE GOT FIVE SEATS 
IT MAY 
THEY 
HAVEN'T HAD FIVE SEATS FOR FORTY YEARS 
THIS IS THE LORD ASHCROFT STRATEGY 
HE PULLED THE MONEY IN AND IT 
WORKS 
NOT IN NORWICH HE HASN'T WORKS GIVEN ANY MONEY THERE ALL AROUND 
THE COUNTRY YOU ARE SEEING 
CONSERVATIVE GAINS IN MARGINAL 
SEATS BIRMINGHAM AT LEAST THREE 
SEATS HAVE GONE CONSERVATIVE 
NUNEATON THEY HAVE TAKEN THEY 
HAVEN'T HELD THAT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THERE 
IS REAL CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION IN 
THE TORY CAMP 
ALEX TELL US WHAT 
THE TONE IS WITH THE LIB DEMS YOU 
WERE LOOKING FRETFUL ABOUT 
LIVERPOOL 
WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT LIVERPOOL WOULD BE DIFFICULT AT THE MOMENT 
WE HAVE LOST THREE OR FOUR SEATS 
ON THE PLUS SIDE WE HAD GAINED A 
NEIGHBOURING 
IT ALWAYS COMES NEIGHBOURING ACROSS 
WE ARE MAKING GAINS IN ACROSS NEIGHBOURING KNOWSLEY WHICH HAS 
BEEN LABOUR SINCE FOREVER OUR MAIN 
SUCCESS STORY IS IN THE SOUTH 
THERE IS A BIG THING ABOUT TORY 
RESURGENCE IN THE SOUTH WE ARE 
PREDICTED TO TAKE SAINT ALBANS WE 
HAVE HELD WINCHESTER 
IN TERMS OF 
THE TONE THE LIB DEMS ARE A 
PRAGMATIC LOT BUT HOW AND AND ENTIRELY TWO THINGS ABOUT THE TONE 
ON THE ONE HAND WE ARE TOTALLY 
HAPPY 
I TOLD YOU 
WE ARE ALWAYS 
HAPPY HAPPY WE HAD A FANTASTIC YEAR IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR WE WERE NOT LOOKING TO MAKE 
MANY GAMES THE LIB DEMS ARE RATHER 
UPSET MOST OF THE POLITICAL BLOGS 
ARE ABOUT JEREMY VINE 
I THINK WE 
MIGHT BE GETTING COMPLAINTS ABOUT 
THE ACCENT 
I THINK IT IS MORE THE 
OVERALL WELL EVERYTHING HE IS 
DOING A POLITE COMMENT PLEASE 
PLEASE TELL JEREMY VINE TO STOP 
DOING THAT NOW 
THAT WASN'T ME I 
HAVE TO DISTANCE MYSELF FROM THESE 
COMMENTS LUKE TELL US WHAT YOU 
ARE GETTING IN TERMS OF TONE SOME 
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY AT THIS EARLY 
STAGE SAYING LABOUR MELT DOWN AND 
IT IS REALLY LOOKING BAD ARE YOU 
GETTING AT 
NOT FROM LABOUR 
COMMENTATORS OR OTHER LABOUR BLOGS 
PEOPLE SEEM TO BE PICKING OUT BITS 
OF GOOD NEWS SEAT GAINS IN SOME OF 
THEIR NORTHERN CITIES LIKE 
LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER ALSO 
SOME KEEP PARLIAMENTARY MARGINALS 
WHERE THE RESULTS ARE NOT THAT BAD 
HASTINGS I BELIEVE WE HAVE PICKED 
UP A SEAT FROM THE LIBERALS 
WORCESTER AND ICONIC SEAT NO 
CHANGE AT ALL THERE LABOUR MORALE 
SEEMS TO BE HOLDING REMARKABLY WELL 
ANY MENTION OF KEN IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO BLOCK BECAUSE NOTHING IS 
HAPPENING 
PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOW HAPPENING TO CALL THE LONDON RESULT WE KNOW 
THAT THE TURNOUT WAS VERY GOOD IN 
INNER CITY AREAS WE ALSO KNOW THE 
TURNOUT WAS VERY GOOD IN THE TORY 
SUBURBAN AREAS WHO KNOWS WE HAVE 
TO GET TO THE COUNT TOMORROW AND 
SEE EXACTLY HOW THE VOTES WAY UP I I SEE THESE LITTLE SMILES GOING ON 
YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS INSIDE THE MIND 
OF A BLOGGER THIS IS OUR WEB PAGE 
HERE IS MY PAGER DO COME AND JOIN 
ME I AM ABOUT TO SIT DOWN AND 
BLOCK CHATTER WHATEVER AT YOUR 
COMMENTS BLOG 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE COUNCILLOR 
SCOREBOARD FIRST OF ALL THE 
COUNCIL'S THIS IS HOW THINGS STAND 
WITH ONLY FORTY IN OVER ONE HUNDRED TO GO 
THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE GAINED 
CONTROL SIX COUNCILS OVERALL 
LABOUR HAS LOST CONTROL OF TWO 
FROM NO OVERALL CONTROL HUNG 
COUNCILS THEY ARE DOWN FOUR THAT 
IS IN FAVOUR OF THE CONSERVATIVES 
ON THE COUNCILLORS THIS IS HOW 
THINGS STAND AT THE MOMENT 
LET'S GO TO SOUTHAMPTON AND JOIN 
CAROLINE RICHARDSON TO TALK ABOUT 
THAT SPECTACULAR TORY VICTORY IN 
SOUTHAMPTON 
IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT SOUTHAMPTON EXPECTED DEVASTATING FOR THE 
LABOUR GROUP AND THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRAT GROUP CERTAINLY IT WAS A 
MATHEMATICAL POSSIBILITY THAT IT 
MIGHT BE A CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY 
IT JUST WAS NOT EXPECTED DE FAIRE 
UN ON THE LOCAL POLITICS THE 
CONSERVATIVE GROUP USED TO RUN THE 
COUNCIL AS A MINORITY THEY HAD A 
BUDGET MEETING AND THE LABOUR AND 
LIB DEM GROUP FORMED A QUEUE AND 
TOOK OVER ADMINISTRATION OF THE 
COUNCIL TO MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT 
IT WAS A BIT UNDEMOCRATIC IT SEEMS 
THAT THE ELECTORATE HAVE VOTED WITH 
THEIR FEET AND THE TIDE HAS TURNED 
BACK FAVOUR OF THE CONSERVATIVES 
ANY IDEA WHAT THE TURNOUT WAS DID 
A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO THE POLLS AS AS FAR AS I AM AWARE IT WAS PRETTY 
GOOD WE HAD A GLORIOUS DAY IN THE 
SOUTH OF ENGLAND A LOT OF PEOPLE 
MAY HAVE BEEN COAXED OUT BY THE 
WARM SUNNY SPRING WEATHER ANOTHER 
REASON WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE PROBABLY 
TURNED OUT WAS THIS IDEA THIS 
RECOMMENDATION THAT THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRAT AND LABOUR HAD TO CHARGE 
PEOPLE FOR PERMIT PARKING THAT 
BECAME VERY UNPOPULAR EVEN THOUGH 
IT WAS ONLY A RECOMMENDATION 
PEOPLE WERE VOWING TO CONCRETE 
THEIR FRONT GARDENS SO THEY DID NOT 
HAVE TO PAY TO PARK OUTSIDE THEIR 
HOUSES IF YOU WANT TO KNOW IF 
PEOPLE ARE VOTING ON LOCAL ISSUES 
I THINK THE ISSUE IS YES 
DO YOU 
EXPECT ANY OTHER COUNCILS AROUND 
SOUTHAMPTON TO FALL TO THE TORIES 
IN THE SAME WAY FROM NO OVERALL 
CONTROL 
THE NLY OTHER ONE THAT WE CONTROL HAVE GOT OUR CLOSE EYE ON HIS 
GOSPORT NOBODY HAS OVERALL CONTROL 
OF THAT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX THEY COULD TAKE 
CONTROL BUT ONLY IF THEY WIN ONE 
WARD ALL OF THE OTHER WARDS HAD 
MASSIVE MAJORITIES FOUR YEARS AGO 
BUT THERE IS A ONE PER CENT SWING IN THAT ONE 
WARD IT COULD BE ANOTHER TORY 
SCALP 
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS SCALP FOR THE M. P.'S IN THE AREA HAVE YOU 
GOT JOHN DENHAM DOWN THERE L. WAS 
TOLD HE WAS GOING TO BE THERE WE WE DO HAVE JOHN DENHAM DOWN HERE L. AM 
SURE HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SPEAK TO 
YOU I ASKED HIM AN HOUR AGO AND HE 
WAS BRACING HIMSELF FOR A DIFFICULT 
NIGHT I IMAGINE HIS WORST FEARS 
HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH INDEED WE HAVE GOT THE RESULT 
FROM WIRE FOREST A CONSERVATIVE 
GAIN FROM THE OVERALL CONTROL 
THIS IS WHETHER KIDDERMINSTER 
HOSPITAL SUPPORTERS RETAINED KENT 
TEN COUNCILLORS 
THE CONSERVATIVES ARE T. H. EIGHT 
OVERALL AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS BY TWO 
WEYMOUTH AND PORTLAND ARE HUNG 
COUNCILS THE CONSERVATIVES ARE 
UP TO AND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
ARE UP ONE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REFERRING 
TO LOCAL ISSUES IF YOU LOOK AT 
PARTICULAR PLACES QUITE A FEW 
PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE 
OF THE LOCAL COUNCIL OR 
WHEN YOU GET RESULTS OF THE KIND 
YOU ARE GETTING NOW LOCAL ISSUES 
MAY NOT PALE INTO INSIGNIFICANCE 
ONE PLACE PLACE ANOTHER PLACE 
NATIONALLY THEY PALE INTO 
INSIGNIFICANCE THERE'S NO 
RANDOMNESS ABOUT THIS THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE DOING WELL OVER 
THE COUNTRY LABOUR IS DOING BADLY 
THERE IS A PATTERN TO THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRAT AS WELL 
YOU ARE 
DEMOCRAT AS WELL YOU ARE THE PERSON WHEN LOOKING AT LOCAL 
COUNCILS 
COUNCILS WHO EMPHASISES 
THAT LOCAL 
ELECTIONS ARE 
WHAT 
YOU ARE SAYING THEN IS THAT THAT 
IDEA IS SWEPT ASIDE FROM THE SCALE 
OF CHANGE 
NO THE IDEA HASN'T BEEN 
SWEPT ASIDE DIFFERENT COUNCILS 
HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF PARTY SUPPORT HULL LOOK THERE FOR 
EXAMPLE THREE 
LABOUR MEMBERS OF 
PARLIAMENT WITH A HUGE MAJORITY 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS CONTROL THE 
COUNCIL THERE'S DIFFERENT PATTERNS 
OF VOTING 
IT'S THE OF I OFT'S THE CHANGE 
OF VOTING IT'S THE CHANGE THAT'S 
NOT RANDOM IT'S UNIFORM TO A 
REMARKABLE EXTENT THE ONE 
INDIVIDUALINDIVIDUAL 
INDIVIDUAL ISSUE 
LIKE THE PARKING 
ISSUE GIVES YOU AN ACT AS TO WHY 
THERE'S A BIG 
SWING IN 
A DIFFERENT 
PLACE WHEN THE PATTERN IS A REAL 
PROBLEM IT'S DIFFERENT WHAT WE 
ARE HEARING FROM THE PEOPLE IS THAT 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH LABOUR WILL 
STRUGGLE TO KEEP READING WHEN YOU 
ST I LOOK AT THE SOUTH AND SAY THE BRAG 
GAINS IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND IS 
PROTECTED THE ANSWER IS NO WHY 
DOES THAT MATTER SEVENTEEN OUT OF THE TOP 
TWENTY FOUR 
MARGINAL MARGINAL 
FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE IN THE SOUTH GO I 
ENGLAND 
I JUST WANT TO GO TO WALES ENGLAND THERE IS AN ISSUE IN READING JUST 
AS THE BUDGET IS AS I AST IS A 
ISSUE LET'S 
LET'S GO ALL AROUND TO WALES AND JOIN 
THEM 
THERE WHAT'S 
THE PICTURE 
THEM THERE WHAT'S THE PICTURE THERE BETSEN 
WELL APOLOGIES 
STRAIGHTAWAY FOR 
ST I 
AND THE 
MIGHT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AT 
EARLIER I ASKED YOU TO LISTEN OUT 
FOR NAMES LIKE FLYNCHER NEWPORT 
AND THAT'S WHERE THE EARLY STORIES 
ARE COMING FROM THREE COUNCILS IN 
THE EAST OF WALES THREE COUNCILS 
HAVE BEEN HELD BY LABOUR NOW THEN 
THE IMPLICATION IS THAT IN FLYNCHER 
ONE COUNCILLOR THE WORD IS THAT 
FLYNCHER HAS THE CONTROL NEWPORT 
IS THE ONLY ONE HELD BY LABOUR 
THIS WILL REALLY T. H. I THALLY HURT 
IT GOES 
THIS WILL REALLY HURT IF IT GOES WELL LABOUR AND THE ASSEMBLYMAN 
JOHN GRIFFITHS IS 
THERE HIS 
VIEW 
OF THINGS IS THAT NEWPORT IS 
SLIPPING NO OVERALL CONTROL BOTH 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS GAINING 
GROUND THERE AND THE CONSERVATIVES 
AND THE OTHER NAME THAT YOU'LL BE 
FAMILIAR WITH DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW 
TO PRONOUNCE THE NAME THEY'VE BEEN 
A THORN HELD BY PETER LORD A 
LABOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER FELL OUT 
WITH THE PARTY STOOD AS INDEPENDENT HIS 
SEAT HELD 
BY HIS 
WIDOW TRISH IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE 
DOING DAMAGE AGAIN FOR LABOUR AS 
ARE SOME OTHER INDEPENDENTS THINGS 
LOOK AS IF THEY ARE PUSHED TO NO 
OVERALL CONTROL IF THAT'S RIGHT A 
LABOUR DID HOLD OUT RIGHT IF 
THEY LOSE THREE THEY'LL 
DOWN DOWN TO THE FOUR 
LET'S SEE WHAT THE KEY WARDS ARE 
SHOWING WE SAW THEM THREE QUARTERS 
OF AN HOUR OR SO AGO JEREMY 
REASSESSMENT OF THEM 
WE HAVE MORE 
IN IT'S FIRMING UP THIS IS THE 
EXERCISE WE DO ONE THOUSAND WARDS WE DO THIS 
IF WE WA I 
WORK OUT HOW THE ELECTION WAS 
LOOKED IF IT WAS ACROSS 
THE WHOLE NATION INSTEAD OF A LOCAL 
ELECTION LET ME SHOW WHERE 
AT THE MOMENT HALF THE KEY WARDS 
ARE IN AND MORE THAN A MILLION 
REAL VOTES ARE BEING COUNTED WE 
CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE 
THE 
PARTIES WHERE 
THEY ARE BEFORE I 
SHOW YOU TO 
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN 
SAYING THIS IS TWO THOUSAND FOUR YOU ARE 
DEALING WITH A BASELINE HERE WHERE 
LABOUR HIT A RECORD 
LOW TWENTY SIX 
PER 
CENT LET'S SEE IF THEY ARE UP AND 
DOWN WHERE 
IS LABOUR 
TONIGHT WELL 
WELL WE HAVE THEM DOWN TWO PER CENT DOWN 
EVEN ON THEIR LOWEST IN LIVING 
MEMORY LABOUR DOWN 
CLEARLY A DISASTROUS PERFORMANCE 
IF THAT IS SHOWN TO BE THE 
CONSERVATIVES DOING 
WELL UP SEVEN PER CENT ON TWO THOUSAND FOUR'S 
PERFORMANCE AND LIB DEMS LET'S 
HAVE A LOOK AT THEM DOWN THREE PER 
CENT NOT A CONVINCING PERFORMANCE 
FROM THEM AT ALL THE OTHERS DOWN TWO 
THAT'S THE 
KEY BOARD 
EXERCISE IT MAY CHANGE AS WE GET 
TOWARD ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF KEY WARDS 
AT A CERTAIN POINT WE'LL BANK IT 
GIVE ALL THE PARTIES A PERCENTAGE 
LATER LA I LA NIGHT NOW IF I CAN 
FOCUS ON THE MAP AGAIN AND SHOW 
YOU SOME OF THE COUNCILS THAT HAVE 
CHANGED HANDS SOME THAT WE'VE C. H. I

LIVINGSTONE THE IDEA OF VOTING 
AGAINST KEN LIVINGSTONE AS 
NAUSEATING I HOPED THE 
CONSERVATIVES OR LIB DEMS WOULD 
OFFER A CANDIDATE THAT WOULD SWING 
IT I HAVE TO SAY OVER THE LAST 
FEW WEEKS I HAVE BEEN STUDYING 
CAREFULLY I ADMIRE BORIS AS A 
WRITER AND A BRAIN BUT I DON'T 
THINK HE HAS EXPERIENCE FOR 
CREDENTIALS

PERSON TO 
BE MAYOR OF LONDON

A HARD ONE I WON'T TELL YOU WHO I 
VOTED FOR FOUR YEARS IN LONDON

TONY BLAIR NUDGEING UP FROM THE 
LOWEST EVER FIGURE THIS TIME LAST

HE'S NOT

BECAUSE

WE HAVE BEEN JOINED BY THREE NEW 
POLITICIANS NOW ED MILIBAND THE 
CABINET MINISTER WILLIAM HAGUE 
SECRETARY AND VINCE 
CABLE AS THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 
SPOKESPERSON YOU INVENTED THE 
STYLING TO MR. BEAN 
WE ARE IN THE 
LAST STAGE OF PROGRESSION 
DO YOU 
THINK THAT'S WHAT HE REACHED NOT NOT QUITE NO ON THE WAY CERTAIN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED TO 
THE LIB DEMS YOU ARE DOING WORSE 
AT THE MOMENT ON THE 
POPULAR SHARE OF THE VOTE YOU ARE 
DOWN THREE POINTS ON WHERE YOU WERE IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR HOW CAN THAT BE 
WE DIDN'T 
EXPECT ANYTHING DIFFERENT 
YOU ARE 
NOT EXPECTING NOT EXPECTING IS A 
PHRASE THAT PEOPLE USE WHEN THE 
WORST HAPPENS CHARLES KENNEDY MADE 
THE POINT TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN TERMS OF 
AGGREGATE VOTES WERE INFLATED BY 
PROCESSES 
POPULAR POLICIES THE PROCESSES IRAQ WAR WAS A POPULAR ISSUE IT 
REMAINS ONE BUT WE HAVE LOST SOME 
GROUND FROM THAT THE POINT GR I 
GROUND FROM THAT THE POINT HE MADE 
LOOKING TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
GENERAL ELECTION AND THOSE THINGS 
GO UP AND DOWN IT DEPENDS 
ON THE 
SEATS WHERE WE HAVE SITTING M. P.'S 
YOU HAVE SEEN EARLIER ON IN YOUR 
PROGRAM CHELTENHAM IS A BELL 
WEATHER SEAT WOULD WE DO BETTER OR 
WORSE WE GAINED FROM THE 
CONSERVATIVES IN THAT AREA WE HELD 
ON TO ROCHDALE ANOTHER MARGINAL 
SEAT IN THE KEY AREAS MARGINAL 
SEATS M. P.'S WITH SMALL MAJORITIES 
WE WOULD HAVE WE I WEE HELD 
GROUND OR 
DONE BETTER 
IF YOU ARE 
DONE BETTER IF YOU ARE DOWN FROM 
DONE BETTER LAST YEAR WHEN CAMPBELL WAS LEADER 
WILL YOU REGRET THE CHOICE 
OF NICK 
CLEGG 
HE HAS NOTHING TO WORRY CLEGG ABOUT PERSONALLY NO 
CAME UP SIXTY PER CENT NINETEEN PER CENT 
WE VA LONG 
GO HE'S 
WE HAVE A LONG 
WAY TO GO 
HAVE DONE BETTER WAND THIS IS 
LOOKING BAD FOR LABOUR WHAT DO YOU 
ATTRIBUTE IT TO NONE OF IT SOUNDS 
CLEAR OR CONVINCING ALL PEOPLE 
EVER SAY IS WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO 
PEOPLE AND SHOW PEOPLE WE CARE 
IT'S DEVASTATING BLOW WHEN THE 
TORIES ARE UP SEVEN PAINTS THEY ARE 
LISTENING TO THE TORIES 
SEVEN 
POINTS THEY ARE LOIVENING TO THE 
TORIES MID TERM GOVERNMENTS DON'T 
DO I DO 
ARE YOU A MID TERM 
GOVERNMENT YOU'VE HAD NEW PRIME 
MINISTER APPOINTED 
WE ARE IN THE 
THIRD TEAM OF A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
LET ME EXPLAIN THAT'S ALWAYS THE 
CASE WE PULLED ON THE THIRTY PER CENT 
AT LOCAL ELECTIONS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCE 
JOHN IS RIGHT ABOUT THAT 
PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY I 
GOT THAT IN MY CONSTITUENCY A 
SENSE OF THAT THIRDLY THE 
GOVERNMENT HAD A DIFFICULT FEW 
MONTH THERE'S NO GETTING AWAY FROM 
THAT THERE'S A SERIES OF THINGS 
THAT HAPPENED 
YOU HAVE NO BOUNCE 
FROM BROWN 
BOM BROWN B. 
MINISTER 
WE DID GET BOUNCE WE HAVE 
DIFFICULT EVENT 
WHAT IS THAT NOT 
HAVING AN ELECTION IN NOVEMBER 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS MISTAKE MISTAKE I DON'T THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE THE 
SPECULATION WAS ALLOWED TO GO ON 
TOO LONG 
WE ACCEPT OUR SHARE OF 
RESPONSIBILITY AFTER THAT 
SPECULATION LETTING IT GO ON THE THE TEN P. CONFUSION 
THE TEN P. AS DIFFICULT 
IN THIS CAMPAIGN LET ME SAY ONE 
OTHER THING DOES THIS MEAN SOMEHOW 
THE TORIES HAVE IT IN THE BAG FOR 
THE GENERAL ELECTION ABSOLUTELY 
NOT THE TASK IS TO SHOW WE CAN 
RESPOND TO PEOPLE'S CONCERNS LET 
ME MAKE AN I'D LOGICAL POINT 
UNUSUAL ON 
THE MOOD OF THE TIMES IS NOT 
PROGRAMS WHICH IS THE MOOD OF THE 
HE 
TIMES IS 
NOT WHAT THE 
TIMES IS NOT WHAT THE TORY STANDS FOR THAT'S WHAT WILLIAM AND HIS 
COLLEAGUES BELIEVE IN WHEN YOU 
THINK 
ABOUT WHAT 
THE 
PEOPLE ARE 
FACING IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
CONCERNS AROUND GLOBAL CARE A CO I COUND GLOBAL CARE A BIG 
ISSUE LOOKING AFTER ALL 
RELATIVES IT'S THE TIMES LET ME GO ON 
IT'S LE I LE 
SIT AND 
SAY THE CONSERVATIVES ARE GAINING 
SEATS THE MOOD ISN'T WITH THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY THESE ARE 
EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS IF THE B. B. C. 
PROCTION IS RIGHT THIS WILL BE THE 
PROJECTION IS RIGHT THIS IS THE 
LOWEST SHARE IN THE HISTORY IT'S 
NOT A MID TERM THING SO THESE I 
THINK WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH RESULTS TO 
SAY THESE ARE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD 
RESULTS FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN YOU 
SEE SIX CONSERVATIVE GAINS IN 
SUNDERLAND THE BARRIER RESULTS 
HAVEN'T COME OUT BIG SWINGS IN THE 
BOLTON WARDS L. THINK THE IDEA THE 
CONSERVATIVES CAN'T WIN IN THE 
NORTH WILL BE LAYED TO NO I NOE LAYED TO REST 
YOU 
YOU WOULD ACCEPT WHAT ED MILIBAND SAYS 
YOU AUTOMATICALLY WIN A GENERAL 
ELECTION WE 
THE NEXT ELECTION ELECTION IS IN THE BAG UNTIL THE 
VOTES AT THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION 
HAVE BEEN GRANTED WE'LL TAKE 
NOTHING FOR GRANTED WE HAVE 
TAKEN STEADY STEPS WHEN 
BECAME THE LEADER WE HAVE TAKEN 
STEPS FORWARD THIS LOOKS LIKE A 
BIG STEP FORWARD 
THE RESULTS ARE 
WORSE THAN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 
WAR WHEN TONY BLAIR WAS SEVERELY 
UNDERPOPULAR WHEN IT WAS EVIDENT 
THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS IN IRAQ 
AND THE WEPIONS FOR MASS 
DESTRUCTION HAVEN'T BEEN WEAPONS 
FOR MASS DESTRUCTION HAVEN'T BEEN 
FOUND GORDON BROWN'S ELECTION AS 
LABOR LEADER WAS BILLED AS 
RENEWAL DOES THAT MEAN IT'S POSSIBLE IT 
PRINCIPLE 
THING THAT MANY BELIEVE T. H. I 
BE 
PLAYED CHANGE THE LEADER HASN'T 
DONE 
THE HOPE MIGHT BE IS A 
RETURN TO POLITICS AS NORMAL IN 
THE TORY YEARS BUT THERE WILL HAVE 
TO BE 
LONG HARD THINKING AFTER 
TO BE LONG HARD THINKING AFTER TONIGHT TWENTY FOUR PER CENT OF THESE FIGURES GO 
ON AS THEY ARE IN 
THE MOMENT AT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EVENING THIS 
WAS THE LOWEST NUMBER OF LABOUR 
COUNCILLORS IN THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND FROM 
WHAT WE CAN TELL THAT WILL BE GOING 
DOWN WE WILL BE GETTING IN A 
WORSE POSITION 
I CANNOT SAY I 
REMEMBER THERE WILL SON DAYS I DO 
REMEMBER HIM RESIGNING THOUGH CAN CAN I JUST MAKE A POINT ABOUT THE GAP 
I WENT BACK TO THE RECORDS TO SEE 
WHAT WAS THE LARGEST GAP BETWEEN 
THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES WHICH 
NEVERTHELESS RESULTED IN THE PARTY 
WINNING THE THAT NEXT ELECTION IF 
YOU GO BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE YOU WILL SEE 
THAT THE 
TORIES HAD A CATASTROPHIC 
LOCAL ELECTION BUT THEY WENT ON 
TO WIN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IN A FEW MOMENTS WE 
SHOULD SEE HOW LARGE THE GAP IS NOW 
BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES A A GOVERNMENT CABINET WAS RUNNING A 
MAIDSTONE LABOUR ARE DOWN TO AT 
THIS POINT IT IS TIME TO CATCH UP 
WITH THE RESULT IN MORE DETAIL 
WHETHER YOU ARE WATCHING IN THE 
COUNTRY 
HELLO YOU JOIN ME NOW WITH THREE 
LONDON POLITICIANS WE'RE NOT QUITE 
SURE IT SHAUN BAILEY SU I 
SURE IT SHAUN BAILEY WHETHER TO 
CALL YOU A POLITICIAN OR NOT A 
POLITICAL FACE FOR THE TORIES LET 
US START WITH THE RACE FOR MAYER 
HE DESCRIBED ONE OF THE CANDIDATE 
AS AN AMIABLE GOOSEBERRY IN THE 
CONTEST THAT IS VERY CROLL 
IT IS TOUGH BEING SQUEEZED BETWEEN 
TWO EMINENT LONG SERVING AND WELL 
KNOWN POLITICIANS WHO ARE ALMOST 
CELEBRITIES YOU SHOULD NOT 
HAVE TO TELL LIBERAL DEMOCRAT WHERE TO PUT THEIR SECOND VOTE 
DEPENDED ON ONE THEIR VIEW WAS AND 
HE DID NOT WANT TO INFLUENCE THAT 
HE DEFINITELY GOT THE SOUND BY US 
GOING HE KULJIT HE CALLED YOUR 
CANDOUR THAT TRAGEDY AND THE OTHER 
ONE OR COMEDY I WAS 
IN TOTTENHAM 
ONE OR COMEDY I WAS IN TOTTENHAM TODAY WALKING ALONG THE STREET AND 
I HAVE TO SAY 
THAT THE GENERAL THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN THE CITY A 
LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SUPPORTING KEN 
IT 
IS HARD 
TO IGNORE BUT IT WILL 
BE HARDER THIS TIME AROUND WITH THE 
ALLEGATIONS I KNOW THEY ATE THEY 
ARE ONLY ALLEGATIONS AT THIS STAGE 
G. E. I 
MARRED 
CAN STICK 
YES 
BUT THAT MARRED CAN STICK YES THIS HAS BEEN TOUGH CAMPAIGN AND 
I THINK IT IS RIGHT TO SAY THAT NO 
INCIDENCES HAVE BEEN PROVEN L. AM 
CONFIDENT THAT KEN WILL BE BACK 
BUT HE NEEDS TO BRING IN PEOPLE WHO 
ARE NOT CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH HIM 
AND COME FROM FIELDS HE HAS ALREADY SAID THAT 
THE IMPORTANT 
THING IS LONDONERS 
ARE TURNING OUT FOR HIM 
AND WHAT 
ABOUT THE MAN THEY 
ABOUT THE MAN THEY CALL COMEDY 
YOU 
WANT TO BE THE NEXT GENERATION OF 
TORY POLITICIANS BUT YOU ARE 
VOTING FOR BORIS 
YES BECAUSE I 
THINK CONSERVATIVES BEING A TORY 
IS A WAY OF LIFE AND BORROWERS 
STAND FOR THAT IT IS A TEAM EVENT 
IF YOU 
LOOK AT 
THE DIFFERENT 
POLICIES THE WHOLE PARTY WAS 
INVOLVED THAT REDUCES THE DISTANCE 
BETWEEN THE LIKES OF ME AND BORIS 
WHAT KIND OF REACTION DOES BORIS 
JOHNSON GET IN AT A SINK ESTATE 
THOUGH YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW PEOPLE 
LIVE IN THESE AREAS WHAT 
BORIS JOHNSON NO 
HE GOES THERE AND 
HE ASKS QUESTIONS AND THE WAY IN 
WHICH HE ASKS THE QUESTIONS ENABLES 
HIM TO UNDERSTAND 
LOOKING AT THE 
WIDER PICTURE YOUR NEW LEADER AND 
NICK CLEGG I KNOW HE TWILIGHT 
NUMBER THIRTY BUT THAT ASIDE HE HAS 
NOT BEEN AIMING VERY HIGH L. THINK 
THE LOOP DEMS NEED TO HOLD THEIR 
OWN RELAYING ARE YOU TALKING 
ABOUT THE LONDON BATTLE L. AM 
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE 
PROJECTED SHARE 
I THINK THE LABOUR 
DEMS WILL HOLD THEIR OWN A QUICK 
THE LONDON 
A QUICK WORD ABOUT THE LONDON ASSEMBLY R. B. B. M. P. A REAL THREAT 
THIS TIME 
WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO KEEP B. N. P. OF 
THE ASSEMBLY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN WE PROJECT 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE TONY ARE ARE THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE FROM 
THE FIGURES THAT HAVE COME IN FROM 
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT 
TOWARDS THE CONSERVATIVES AND A 
SWING AWAY FROM LABOUR THIS WOULD 
POTENTIALLY PUT ONE OF THE 
CONSTITUENCY SEATS IN LONDON UNDER 
THREAT AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE 
LABOUR SEATS OVER ALL 
IT IS A VERY 
DIFFERENT VOTING SYSTEM HERE TO THE 
REST OF THE COUNTRY HOW MANY 
PEOPLE DO YOU THINK REALLY 
UNDERSTOOD THE SECOND PREFERENCE 
VOTES 
I'M NOT SURE THEY DID BUT VOTES ONCE THEY GOT INTO THE POLLING 
BOOTH THEY WERE FACED WITH BALLOT 
PAPERS AND I THINK MANY OF IT RIGHT ON 
THE DAY 
COMPLICATED MIXTURE OF THE TWO A A QUICK WORD BEFORE WE GO ABOUT THE 
CANDIDATES FOR MAYER KEN 
LIVINGSTONE IS LOOKING VERY SOLID 
AS AN INCUMBENT WHICH IS SLIGHTLY 
UNSETTLING MICHAEL PORTILLO WAS 
SAYING THAT BORIS WAS NOT FIRST 
CHOICE FOR THE TORIES WILL THAT BE 
A PROBLEM IF HE DOES GET IN 
IF HE 
DOES GET IN DAVID CAMERON AND THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY MACHINE WILL 
WANT TO DISCIPLINE THE 
KIND OF 
PEOPLE HE HAS INI IS DEPARTMENT 
WE 
WE WILL BE BACK WITH YOU SHORTLY 
THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE TAKEN 
CONTROL OF BURY 
IN GREATER 
CONTROL OF BURY IN GREATER MANCHESTER TWENTY SIX COUNCILLORS 
CONSERVATIVES ARE UP 
THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE ONE 
CANDIDATE CANDIDATE THE GREENS LOSE THEIR 
SEATS IN BURY AND SAINT ALBANS A 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT GAIN THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS ARE UP ONE 
HAD ENOUGH OF THESE WARDS IN TO 
CALL THE ELECTION IN TERMS OF THE 
PROJECTED NATIONAL SHARE WE ARE 
ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE WAY PEOPLE 
HAVE VOTED IN HIS COUNCIL ELECTIONS 
THIS IS THE BIG MOMENT NOW WE 
TAKE 
TA EIGHT TA BOATS IN THE LOCAL D. ELECTION ACROSS PART OF THE COUNTRY 
AND WE WILL GIVE YOU PERCENTAGES AS 
IF PEOPLE HAD VOTED ACROSS THE 
WHOLE OF THE COUNTRY WE CALL THAT 
A PROJECTED SHARE 
NEARLY SEVENTY 
PER CENT OF 
THE 
KEY WARDS 
ARE IN NOW FIFTEEN 
MILLION VOTES OR MORE THESE ARE 
THE PERCENTAGES WHICH WILL BE IN 
GRAF'S IN THE YEARS TO COME AND 
THEY ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT HE WE GO 
WE ARE GOING TO SEE LABOUR'S 
FIRST LABOUR HAVE TWENTY FOUR PER CENT IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THEY HAD THEIR LOWEST EVER 
AS WE MENTIONED IT WAS TWENTY SIX MR. 
BROWN FAR FROM 
RENEWIROM RENEWI 
PARTY 
AS WAS HOPED SEEMS TO HAVE GONE 
BELOW THAT THIS WILL BE BLOW FOR 
LABOUR AND A BLOW FOR MR. BROWN 
WHAT ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVES THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE REGISTERED 
REALLY SUBSTANTIAL RISE ON THEIR 
PERFORMANCE LAST YEAR FORTY FOUR PER CENT WHICH 
IS REAL AND SERIOUS PROGRESS 
TOWARDS WINNING A GENERAL LECTION 
AND FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS TWENTY FIVE 
PER CENT ONE BELOW THEIR PERFORMANCE 
LAST YEAR THEY HAVE ACTUALLY 
BEATEN LABOUR WITH THEIR TWENTY FIVE PER CENT AND 
ARE IN FACT NOW IN SECOND PLACE 
THERE WE ARE THE PROJECTED 
NATIONAL SHARE FOR THESE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS.ELECTIONS 
TO YOU THANK YOU 
ELECTIONS OVER TO YOU THANK YOU JEREMY JEREMY TONY LLOYD M. P. 
JOINS US JO EIGHT JO 
THE NORTH WEST 
JOINS US NOW FROM THE NORTH WEST TONY 
LLOYD THESE 
RESULTS THAT HAVE 
TONY LLOYD THESE RESULTS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH AND THE PROJECTED 
NATIONAL SHARE 
ARE MAJOR 
DISASTER FOR LABOUR AREN'T 
DEFINITELY THERE ARE NO WORDS I 
CAN PUT ON IT THINK MOST LABOUR M. P.'S AND LABOUR 
ACTIVISTS IN 
MY OWN CONSTITUENCY KNEW THAT THIS 
WOULD BE A 
DIFFICULT ELECTION 
WITHIN ALL THAT WHAT LABOUR HAS TO 
DO NOW 
IS TO 
RECOGNISE THE VERY 
DO NOW IS TO RECOGNISE THE VERY CLEAR SIGNAL THAT THE PUBLIC WANTS 
A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WHO ARE 
LISTENING TO WHAT 
LI EIGHT 
ARE 
LISTENING TO WHAT THE PUBLIC ARE SAYING WE HAVE GOT TO BE VERY 
EIGHT 
CONSCIOUS OF 
THE FACT THAT THIS IS 
NOT A GENERAL ELECTION WHAT 
LOCAL ELECTIONS TEND TO BE IS 
AFFECTED BY LOCAL ISSUES OVERALL 
WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A REFERENDUM 
ON WHERE THE GOVERNMENT DANCE 
YOU HAVE A NEW PRIME DANCE MINISTER 
WHO WAS 
CHOSEN BY THE 
LABOUR PARTY WITHOUT AN ELECTION 
HE TALKED ABOUT CHANGE AND THE 
FIRST EVIDENCE OF IS 
DOING IS THE LOWEST FIGURE IN 
POPULAR VOTE THAT THEY HAVE HAD FOR 
FORTY YEARS 
THIS HAS BEEN A VERY 
DIFFICULT NIGHT FOR LOBAR LABOUR 
WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE MINISTER IT SAYS THAT GORDON BROWN 
MI I D. HAS GOT 
TO LISTEN 
TO WHAT THE 
PUBLIC ARE SAYING 
THEY NEED TO GET 
D. BACK ON TRACK AND ADDRESS THE 
ISSUES IS EIGHT IS ISSUES WHAT HAVE 
THEY NOT BE ISSUES LISTENING TO 
THEIR BEEN ISSUES 
RECENTLY 
OVECENTLY OVE 
TEN P. TAX WHAT 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE IS NOW PUT 
FORWARD A PACKAGE WHICH WILL 
MINIMISE THE IMPACT 
OF IMPACT OF 
MINIMISE THE IMPACT OF THAT 
BUT 
WHAT 
T. WE HAVE 
IS TO MAKE SURE 
WE EXPLAIN WHY ARE WE WE EIGHT WEHY ARE WE ARE 
THESE THINGS AND HOW WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS SITUATION 
THE SCARMAN IS IN THE STRONGEST ECONOMIC POSITION EC EIGHT ECITION THAT 
ECONOMIC POSITION THAT BRITAIN'S HAS 
HA EIGHT HA MANY YEARS HA EIGHT D. WILL EXPECT OF THIS GOVERNMENT IS 
THAT WE EXPLAIN CLEARLY WHAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS THERE FOR A WALK AND 
HOWARD INTENDS TO

FEELS UNDER THREAT THROUGH GLOBAL 
ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS NO 
WONDER THAT THAT 
AFFECTS THE 
GOVERNMENT I 
THINK THERE IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT ISSUE THERE WILL BE A 
FOCUS ON WHAT CONSERVATIVE 
GOVERNMENT 
MIGHT MEAN 
AND 
GOVERNMENT MIGHT MEAN IGHT MEAN 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE LONG TERM ISSUES OF THIS COUNTRY 
NOT 
THINK THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE MUCH 
TO SAY 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS 
HAVE DEMONSTRATED 
THAT WE PROVIDE 
HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT WE PROVIDE BETTER VALUE FOR TAXPAYERS' MONEY 
THIS IS A POSITIVE CHOICE BORA A 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 
I GENUINELY THINK THIS WHEN YOU 
THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS FACING 
BRITAIN I THINK YOUR PHILOSOPHY 
WHICH HIS GOVERNMENT SHOULD GET OUT 
OF THE WAY I THINK THAT PHILOSOPHY 
WILL BE FOUND WANTING YOU W. I. EIGHT 
YOU ARE OFFERING ANY THINK THIS TIME OUGHT TO THINK THAT IT WAS 
JUST THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT OF GORDON 
BROWN WAS NOT VERY POPULAR YOU YOU FOCUSED ON BURIED A 
MANCHESTER SUBURB NEXT DOOR IN 
ANOTHER SUBURB IT IS PERHAPS MORE 
TYPICAL OF WHAT IS HAPPENING L. 
THINK HE IS NOT JUST A QUESTION OF 
DISAFFECTION WITH THE LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT WE HAVE BEEN ENTRENCHED 
IN MANY PARTS OF GOVERNMENT LAST LAST YEAR AFTER YOU GOT TWENTY SIX PER CENT YOU GOT RID 
OF YOUR LEADER NOW YOU 
HAVE TWENTY FIVE 
PER CENT 
YOU WILL GET RID OF ANOTHER LEADER 
WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT 
IMPROVEMENIMPROVEMEN 
IMPROVEMENTS TO 
THE LAST FEW MONTHS 
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO STOP IT IS THE RELATIVE POSITION 
OF THE 
IS 
RELATIVE TO LABOUR WE HAVE MADE OPPOSITE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR 
POSITION MOST PEOPLE HAVE NOT FELT 
THIS SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY WHEN 
IT DOES 
FORMAT WIT IS LISTENING TO 
IT DOES THIS FROM LIVERPOOL WHAT IS YOUR 
READING OF ALL THIS A LODGER 
ADVICE P. T. LABOUR 
WE HAVE TO CARRY 
ON WE 
HAVE TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE WE WE MADE 
THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT RECOVER 
FROM L. BELIEVE 
WE CAN STILL WIN 
THE NEXT ELECTION BUT TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF WHAT 
PEOPLE ARE 
TAKE ACCOUNT OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE EIGHT 
THINKING AT

TLLING US T. 
NOT TOO SA EIGHT SAAT 
YOU LOOK AT 
ECONOMIC SITUATION 
THEUATION THE 
PEOPLE IN WORK WE HAVE INVESTED 
MORE IN HEALTH AND EDUCATION AND I 
THINK WE ARE NOW STARTING ON A NEW 
PHASE WHERE WE ARE LISTENING TO 
PEOPLE AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN 
DELIVER THE GOODS 
TONY KING IS A 
HERE LISTENING TO YOU WE HAVE 
HEARD SEVERAL PEOPLE SAY THAT 
MINISTERS MUST NOW LISTEN WHEN 
THEY LISTEN WHAT ARE THEY ACTUALLY 
GOING TO DO WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND 
WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT ABOUT THE 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT HAS 
BEEN FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS WHAT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS IF WE FIND 
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING WRONG THAT 
WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO 
WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE AND ACT 
ON WHAT THEY ON EIGHT US AND I 
BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD DO L. BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS NOT 
ELECTION 
A LOT 
OF 
PEOPLE HERE ARE LABOUR SUPPORTERS 
HAVE STAYED AT HOME L. THINK WE HAVE TO GET THOSE 
PEOPLE OUT 
AND I 
THINK IF WE CAN GET THEM OUT WE 
WOULD DO WELL AT A GENERAL ELECTION 
ALL THE RESULTS ARE NOT IN IT WE 
HAVE TO LISTEN WE HAVE TO 
FROM THIS AND WE HAVE TO PUT OUR 
POLICIES MORE VIGOROUSLY AT THE 
SAME TIME WE HAVE ALWAYS GOT TO 
LISTEN TO PEOPLE'S CONCERNS WE CAN 
RECOVER 
HE HAD BEEN A LONG TIME RECOVER RECOVER THE LABOUR ELECTION 
PARTY HAVE 
USED SEEN ELECTIONS AS BAD AS THIS 
BEFORE 
WE HAVE HAD BAD TIMES BEFORE BEFORE AND WE HAVE RECOVERED WE DO 
NOT NEED 
TO PANIC 
WE 
NEED TO 
LISTEN TO WHAT 
THE PEOPLE 
ARE 
LISTEN TO WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE THINKING IF WE DO THAT I BELIEVE 
WE WILL GET BACK ON THE ROAD TO 
SUCCESS TONY KING SUCCESS

IS 
THAT GORDON IS AT HIS BEST WHEN HE

BELIEFS ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN

THEM HE IS AT HIS BEST WHEN HE IS 
TALKING ABOUT THIS AND THIS IS TA EIGHT 
HE WILL BE DOING OVER THE LAST 
NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS 
THAT WAS 
A 
NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS THAT WAS A REALLY CHEAP JIBE YESTERDAY BUT BUT TRUE CAROLINE 
EVERY POLITICIAN HAS 
TO SELL THE POLICIES THAT THEY 
STAND FOR ON THE DOORSTEP BUT ALSO 
A LEADER HAS TO BRING ABOUT 
WITHIN AN ORGANISATION GETTING 
CHANGED IN AN ORGANISATION IS ONE 
OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS TO DO 
WHAT DAVID CAMERON HAS MANAGED TO 
DO IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS 
BRING ABOUT WHOLESALE CHANGE IN 
ESSENCE WE KNOW GORDON ES EIGHT ESKNOW GORDON BROWN 
ESSENCE WE KNOW GORDON BROWN WE HAVE HAD HIM AS CHANCELLOR FOR A 
VERY LONG TIME 
HE HAS BEEN A 
VERY SUCCESSFUL CHANCELLOR 
BUT THE 
CHANGE IS THE COUNTRY 
CAN 
ONLY BE DELIVERED BY A PARTY WHO 
KNOWS HOW TO CHANGE AND DAVID 
CAMERON KNOWS HOW TO CHANGE THE THE CONSERVATIVES ARE NOW GOING TO BE 
SUBJECT TO MUCH CLOSER SCRUTINY 
AFTER THIS SUCCESS ALL NIGHT DAVID 
CAMERON HAS DONE A LOT TO IMPROVE 
THEIR IMAGE AND THERE HAS BEEN AN 
ADVANCE IN PRESENTATION AND IMAGE

PART OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
AMONG THE 
CRITICS OF 
WE 
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS 
EVENING HE IS CHARLES CLARKE'S 
REACTION AT RE S. RETONIGHT THE RESULTS 
THAT HAVE COME IN SO FAR 
WE HAVE 
REALLY GOT TO FOCUS ON HOW WE WIN A 
WHAT WE 
DO THERE IS A REAL MESSAGE 
TO US FROM THE ELECTORATE THIS IS 
A MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVE 
AND ACT UPON 
D'YOU THINK YOU CAN 
WIN UNDER GORDON BROWN 
I THINK IT 
IS POSSIBLE BUT IT REQUIRE 
CHANGES WE HAVE TO SEND A MESSAGE 
AND OUR PURPOSE IN A 
CONVINCING 
WNVINCING W. 
WE HAVE DONE SO 
CONVINCING WAY THAT WE HAVE DONE SO FAR I AGREE 
I AGREE 
FAR I AGREE WITH WHAT 
CHARLES HAS 
FAR I AGREE WITH WHAT CHARLES HAS SAID I THINK WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 
TEAM AT PRESENT 
YOU DO IS AGREE 
WITH HIM ON THAT 
IT IS UP TO THE 
PRIME MINISTER WHO IS IN HIS TEAM 
BY THE WE HAVE A VERY GOOD TEAM I I DON'T THINK CHARLES CLARKE IS 
SAYING THAT HE THINKS THE TEAM IS 
RIGHT WHAT HE IS SAYING IS THAT 
IMPORTANT CHANGES ARE NEEDED HE IS 
SAYING THAT AT THE VERY TOP OF THE 
CABINET 
PEOPLE ARE 
NOT PERFORMING 
IN A WAY THAT IS A REASSURING THE 
PUBLIC SOME 
LIC SOME 
AT NEED TO 
CHANGE THEIR PROFILE OR FRANKLY TO 
BE REPLACED 
HAVE A RESHUFFLE BECAUSE THIS OFTEN 
AFFECT ITS POPULARITY BUT GORDON 
BROWN NOW NEEDS TO 
THINK IF 
THERE 
IS 
CHANCE TO CHANGE HIS 
TEAM TO TRY AND GET A STRONGER TEAM 
THAT THE PUBLIC WILL BE REASSURED 
T. H. I THLIC WILL BE REASSURED D. BY THERE ARE GRAVE DOUBTS AMONGST BY LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AS TO THE 
GOVERNMENT'S 
CONFIDENC CONFIDENC 
GOVERNMENT'S CONFIDENCE MOST 
GOVERNMENT'S CONFIDENCE MOST PEOPLE THINK IT IS BEING STEERED 
ONTO THE ROCKS IN WAY VERY UNCERTAIN WAY 
THERE IS NO SENSE OF DIRECTION 
PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW QUITE WHAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT THERE IS A 
REAL SENSE OF NOT KNOWING WHAT 
THESE PEOPLE ARE ABOUT PEOPLE DO 
NOT KNOW WHAT A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
IS LIKE AT THE MOMENT THEY DO NOT 
KNOW WHY IT IS THERE ON WHAT 
FOR THERE IS MUCH TALK OF 
LISTENING BUT WHAT WILL THEY SAY 
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU ABOUT THAT 
IS WHAT WE STAND FOR IS ACCUSING D. THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE THE 
PROBLEMS THEY FACED IN THEIR OWN 
LIVES FOR EXAMPLE CARING FOR 
ELDERLY RELATIVES WHERE YOU ARE 
RIGHT TONY IS THAT EVENTS AND WE 
CAN NAME SOME OF THEM OVER THE LAST 
FEW MONTHS GET IN THE WAY OF BEIWAY ABLE 
TO PROJECT 
THAT WE HAVE TO BE 
BETTER AT BEING ABLE TO PROJECT 
THOSE EVENTS L. L. THINK THERE WILL BE 
THE FOCUS NOW ON THE CHOICE BETWEEN 
CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR AND THAT IS 
A CONTRAST THAT WE RELISH 
WHEN IT 
COMES TO BE GAY ISSUES I DO 
THINK THEY HAVE ANSWERS 
WHEN THE 
PUBLIC WERE ASKED ABOUT THINGS 
THE PUBLIC SAID THAT THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE A BETTER TEAM AT 
FOR GOVERNMENT MANY PEOPLE HAVE 
SAID THAT THE LABOUR PARTY 
DIVIDED THAN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
CAROLINE HIS SOUND EXTREMELY 
COMPLACENT 
I AM NOT COMPLACENT MY COMPLACENT PARTY HAS HAD TO REBUILD ITSELF AND 
THE FACT THAT YOU ACCUSE ME OF THAT 
TELLS ME THAT YOU ARE NOT LISTENING 
TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING TO YOU 
WE WILL LEAVE THE TUTORIAL TORIES 
TEACHER LABOUR HARD TO WIN 
ELECTIONS WE KNOW THAT THE PICTURE 
IS SPORT FOR LADY LABOUR BUT IT 
IS DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY 
I UNDERSTAND IT YOU 
MAY BE EXPECTING FOUR AS THE SUMMER 
CROWING FROM THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
AND THAT IS HAPPENING HERE A VERY 
VERY POSITIVE 
FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY NOTHING 
SPECIFIC 
I THINK THE HER TORIES 
WILL BE EXPECTING SOMETHING MORE 
FOR THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE TO FILL 
CONFIDENT OF WINNING THE NEXT 
ELECTION THEY WILL HAVE TO BE MORE 
D. CONSISTENT IN 
ISTENT I. 
OPINION POLL IS L. AM A BROADCASTER 
LIKE YOU BUT I'M TRYING TO BEAT HIS 
PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS 
OUT THIS 
THE 
CONSERVATIVES NEED TO HAVE I HIGHER 
NUMBER THEN THEY HAVE GOT TODAY 
GIVEN THAT THEY NEED TO GET A MUCH 
HIGHER PERCENTAGE TO BE SENT THUS 
CERTAIN OF WINNING THEN THEY WILL 
NEED TO GET HIGHER THAN THIS TO BE 
COMFORTABLE IN THE 
NEXT ELECTION 
WHAT HAS GONE WRONG FOR LABOUR IS 
IT THE TEN P. TAX 
THE TEN P. TAX AND 
CERTAINLY DID DELIVER A BIG BLOW 
TWENTY FOUR IT IS VERY BAD AND THAT LABOUR 
WILL HAVE TO GO AWAY AND RETHINK A 
LOT OF THINGS 
THIS IS WHAT TONY 
BLAIR TRIED TO AVOID BY CLIMBING 
DOWN WHEN HE DID 
THE MISTAKE WAS 
SO SERIOUS THAT THERE WAS NO WAY 
OUT OF IT AND HE SHOULD HAVE 
ACKNOWLEDGED IT AND APOLOGISE TO A 
LOT EARLIER HE NEEDS TO TAX THE 
RICH MORE TO PAY FOR IT L. DO NOT 
THINK YOU'LL HAVE THE GUTS JUST JUST LISTENING TO PEOPLE SAYING THAT 
THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE TELLING 
LABOUR HARD TO THIS UNTYPICAL AND 
WIN ELECTIONS HAVE WE GOT SIT 
THIS 
AT THINK THIS IS A TURNING THIS POINT TONIGHT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH 
TO SAY THAT THIS IS AN ELECTION FOR 
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN THE NEXT 
ELECTION 
WHO WILL BE HERE TOMORROW ELECTION IT AT CITY HALL 
IF YOU ARE GORDON 
BROWN YOU'RE NOW BE IN AT A 
CONSISTENT SEE REPRESENTED BY LIB 
DEMS 
AT THIS POINT THE CONSERVATIVE ARE 
BITING THEIR NAILS AND SAYING HOW 
DID THIS HAPPEN 
BORIS IS A PRETTY 
UNRELIABLE PERSON SO I DO NOT KNOW 
HOW HE WILL MANAGE THE CITY BORIS 
DOES NOT STRIKE ME AS A MODERNISING 
FIGURE AT ALL HE IS MORE OF A 
THROWBACK L. THINK IT IS A DOUBLE 
EDGED SWORD BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT 
THAT BE CONSERVATIVES WANTED TO WIN 
LONDON AND HAVE ONE LONDON TO TO THINK THAT KEN LIVINGSTONE AT HIS 
ART OF THE RACE WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
THE T. H. EIGHT THONS HAVE DOGGED HIM 
THE NEWSPAPER 
HAS NOT BEHAVE HIM LIKE A 
NEWSPKE A NEWSP 
ALL MOST OF 
THE STORIES HAVE NOT BEEN TAKEN UP 
BY ANYONE AND OWLS 
T. THINK IT 
WARNED HIM WA EIGHT WAOWN 
A THINK IT HAS 
DIMINISHED THE VOTE HE WOULD HAVE 
HAD L. THINK CONSIDERING THAT 
LABOUR IS ON TWENTY FOUR PER CENT HE WOULD HAVE HAD 
TO FIGHT VERY HARD TO WIN ANYWAY 
ABOUT LIB DEMS WOULD BE A NICE NOTE FOR THEM ESPECIALLY AS IT IS 
ONE MORE 
THEN IT LABOUR FOUR YEARS 
AGO THEY WERE WINNING ANTI WAR 
POETS FROM 
LABOUR AND 
THEY EXPECTED 
THOSE BOATS TO GO BACK THIS IS A 
GOOD NIGHT FOR THEM 
THANK YOU ALL 
VERY MUCH INDEED THAT IS ALL FROM 
US AT CITY HALL 
THE RESULT 
FROM BURNINGHAM NOBODY COULD TAKE 
BURNINGHAM IT IS TOO DIVIDED IT 
IS STILL A HUNG COUNCIL THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAD AN OVERALL GAIN 
OF SIX LABOUR AND OVERALL DOWN OF 
SIX LIB DEMS NO CHANGE RESPECT 
PARTY IS UP ONE HASTINGS IN EAST 
SUSSEX HUNG COUNCIL 
CONSERVATIVES ON FIFTEEN UP ONE LABOUR 
UP ONCE LIB DEMS DOWN TO THE 
CONSERVATIVES HOLD ONTO AND THE 
EIGHT 
VALLEY THE 
B. N. P. GAINED TWO SEATS IN 
AMBER VALLEY THE FIRST WELSH 
COUNCIL WE HAVE HAD IN TONIGHT 
CONSERVATIVES ARE ONE LIB DEMS UP 
ONE AND ON EIGHT ONRS NINE IN WALES 
AT THE INDEPENDENCE WHO ARE THE 
INDEPENDENCE 
I THINK WHAT IS INDEPENDENCE INTERESTING IS THE NUMBER OF 
INDEPENDENCE 
IN WALES 
INDEPENDENCE IN WALES WHO HAVE DECLARED THEMSELVES AS 
CONSERVATIVES ITS IS EASIER NOW TO 
GET OFF THE FENCE AND SAY YOU'RE A 
REALLY A CONSERVATIVE THAT IS ONE 
OF THE REASONS WE OF EIGHT OFNS WE HAVE 
OF THE REASONS WE HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO 
FIELD MORE CANDIDATES FI EIGHT FIANDIDATES THAN 
AT 
THESE ELECTIONS 
THE SNOW IS NOT 
MOVING 
IT BECAUSE OF THE WIND BUT VERY COLD HERE MAYBE HAD 
THIS MURAL IN YOUR SCHOOL HOW 
EIGHT 
EIGHT BECAME 
A MAN AND WE ARE 
EIGHT BECAME A MAN AND WE ARE ASKING IF THIS IS THE STORY OF 
CONSERVATIVE PROGRESSION 
IF WE 
LOOK AT JOHN MAJOR IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THEN 
HERE HE IS THERE A VERY LOW SHOWED 
THE NEXT ONE IS WELL YEMEN IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
THIRTY THREE PER CENT DUNCAN SMITH TWO THOUSAND TWO THERE HE 
IS NOT STRAIGHT ENOUGH TO WIN A 
GENERAL ELECTION WALKING TALL UP 
ARE NOT QUITE THERE MICHAEL HOWARD 
THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT THOUGHT HE MIGHT WIN THE 
GENERAL ELECTION BUT DIDN'T AND 
HERE WE AT THE END OF THE 
PROJECTION BY AGGRESSION FORTY PER CENT 
WE WERE ASKING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 
TONIGHT TO GO BELOW THAT WOULD BE 
A SERIOUS REVERSE ALL THAT HAS NOT 
HAPPENED HERE IS THE NEW 
PERCENTAGE FOR THE CONSERVATIVES 
FORTY FOUR PER CENT A FABULOUS RESULT FOR THEM 
THERE JEREMY A LUCKY MAN WE SIT 
HERE US TALKING STATISTICS WE HAVE 
JOINED HERE BY JOHN CURTICE 
NORMALLY ALL THE POLITICIANS LEAP 
ON YOUR FIGURES AND START 
COMPLAINING TONIGHT EVERYBODY 
SEEMS TO BE EXPECTING THEM 
IT IS A 
VERY VERY CLEAR RESULT PERHAPS THE 
MOST IMPORTANT THING MO EIGHT 
AID IS 
THAT THE OPINION POLLS HAD BEEN 
SUGGESTING OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS 
THAT THE CONSERVATIVES WHEN NOW IN 
A VERY STRONG POSITION THEN IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
NOW WE HAVE A SET NO EIGHT NOA SET OF 
RESULTS THAT ARE THE BEST FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE 
OPINION POLLS AND THE BALLOT BOX 
AND ARE NOW TELLING THE SAME STORY 
IT IS NOT A STORY THAT SAYS THAT 
THE CONSERVATIVES WILL WIN 
GENERAL ELECTION BUT IT SAYS THAT 
THE CONSERVATIVES WILL ARE IN A 
STRONGER POSITION SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO L. 
THINK MY VIEW IS THAT THE LABOUR 
PARTY HAS FALLEN INTO THIRD PLACE 
AND THEY HAVE SIMPLY OVERTAKEN 
BECAUSE THERE IS FOR THAT SLOT IF 
YOU LOOK AT THE VOTES FOR THE LIB 
DEMS TONIGHT AND COMPARE IT WOULD 
BUY WARD 
THEY ADD ACHIEVED 
LAST YEAR LA EIGHT LAEY DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT BI EIGHT BIA LOT 
IS ACTUALLY A 
LITTLE BIT WORSE FOR LIB DEMS THAN 
LAST YEAR THEY WERE ABLE TO PICK 
UP SEATS FROM LABOUR BECAUSE LABOUR 
IS DOING SO BADLY 
IF YOU GO BACK 
TO TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE LIB DEMS VOTE 
THE 
DEMS IS ON A GENERAL SLIDE FROM THE POST IRAQ WAR HEIGHT F. R. EIGHT DO 
FROM THE POST IRAQ WAR HEIGHT DO YOU THINK THAT CAN BE 
AT CAN BE 
CERTAINLYCERTAINLY 
CERTAINLY SO 
AND I THINK THE 
THAT WE HAVE TAKEN OVERTAKEN 
LABOUR 
IS A 
GOOD SIGN BUT THE 
LABOUR IS A GOOD SIGN BUT THE PROFESSOR JUST MEANT THAT THAT WAS 
BECAUSE LABOUR IS BE EIGHT BEUR IS LOSING 
BECAUSE LABOUR IS LOSING SUPPORT 
NOT YOU ARE GAINING SUPPORT WE WE WILL GET BACK TO AFTER 
THE IRAQ WAR DEMONSTRATIONS 
HAVE DONE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL SOME AREAS 
IF YOU WENT TO THE SEATS HELD BY 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT MEMBERS OF 
PARLIAMENT WE WON ALMOST ALL 
COUNCIL SEATS IN EASTERLY THINK 
YOU'LL FIND THAT ACROSS THE BOARD 
WE'VE DONE EXTREMELY WELL IN THOSE 
AREAS WHERE WE WERE STRONG AND HAVE 
BUILT REPUTATION FOR COMPETENCY 
NICK YOU HAD YOUR HAND THERE FIRST 
THE GREAT ANXIETY FOR THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS AND VINCE CABLE MAY 
CHOOSE TO AGREE OR DISAGREE THAT 
TRADITIONALLY AS LABOUR HAS FALLEN 
BACK OFTEN THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
HAVE STRUGGLED LITTLE BIT AS WELL 
IF IN ADDITION TO THAT HISTORICAL 
FACT YOU ADD 
THE FACT 
THAT FA I 
FA I HAVEN'T FOUND A NEW CAUSE AFTER THE 
IRAQ WAR AND THEY'RE ON THEIR THIRD 
LEADER NOW AND THAT HASN'T DONE THE 
TRICK IT IS NOT A CRISIS BY ANY 
STRETCH OF THE 
IMAGINAHE IMAGINA 
THEY ARE HAVING TO SIT AND THINK 
WHAT DO WE 
DO WE 
CAN'T CHANGE 
LEADER AGAIN LONG HARD GRAFT 
DELIVERS IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT NOT 
IN OTHERS TONY 
SIMPLY VINCE CABLE TONY ALLUDED TO THIS AND IT'S TRUE IF 
YOU LOOK AT THE PROJECTED NATIONAL 
SHARE OF THE VOTE LIB DEMS 
OVER THE LAST OV I 
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
IT LOOKS 
LIKE THIS TWO THOUSAND FOUR TWENTY NINE TWO THOUSAND FIVE TWENTY EIGHT 
TWO THOUSAND SIX TO TWENTY SEVEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO TWENTY SIX TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWENTY FIVE TWENTY I 
DOESN'T LOOK TERRIBLY HEALTHY FROM 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS' POINT OF 
VIEW ONE OTHER THOUGHT THAT 
BE BROUGHT TO THE FOREIS VERY 
SERIOUS FOR LABOUR 
IF YOU 
LOOK AT 
THE ELECTIONS OF NINETY SEVEN TWO THOUSAND ONE TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
THE 
LABOUR PARTY 
BENEFITED HUGELY 
IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF SEATS BY 
TACTICAL VOTING 
TA I TAING WITH 
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD 
PROBABLY HAVE OTHERWISE VOTED 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 
OPTING INSTEAD TO 
VOTE LABOUR VO I VOWHERE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAD 
NO CHANCE 
OPINION POLLS AND 
THIS HASN'T 
BEEN PICKED UP 
WIDELY 
ARE NOW 
SUGGESTING THAT LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS WHERE THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE LOCALLY 
HAS NO CHANCE OR MUCH MORE EVENLY 
DIVIDED AND LOT OF THE 
PROJECTIONS THAT 
ARE OFFERED VOTES 
TO SEATS SIMPLY GO ON THE 
ASSUMPTION THAT 
THE FUTURE 
WILL BE 
LIKE THE PAST THE TACTICAL VOTING 
WILL GO ON BENEFITING LABOUR L. 
THINK IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT THE 
LABOUR PARTY 
LA I 
AT THE 
NEXT ELECTION AND COULD EVEN HARM 
THE LABOUR PARTY 
LET ME JUST 
WE'VE BEEN 
JOINED BY 
IAN GIBSON

BEEN HEARING IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN 
THE PARTIES OUR OPPOSITION PARTIES 
USED IT US I US LAST MINUTE LEAFLETS TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT 
WE WERE 
DISCREDITED AND 
SO ON AND 
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BITTEN TO SOME 
EXTENT HAVING SAID THAT 
NORWICH HERE THE LABOUR PARTY 
STILL HAS OVERALL CONTROL AND YOU 
KNOW A SORT OF HUNG LOCAL COUNCIL 
THE GREENS HAVE MOVED PROMINENTLY 
INTO SECOND PLACE TWO 
LABOUR AND HAVE NOW BECOME A FORCE

WHEN YOU'RE IN GOVERNMENT THAT 
ALL 
THE GOOD THINGS YOU DO JUST GET 
POCKETED AS WE SAY ALWAYS GOT 
TWAYS GOT T. 
LOOKING TO HOW YOU 
CAN REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE 
C. A. I RENEWED ANXIETIES THE RENEWED 
ASPIRATIONS PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS 
ARE RISING EVERY YEAR AND I WELCOME 
THAT BUT IT GIVES US NEW 
CHALLENGES 
BUT SURELY IT'S CHALLENGES CHALLENGES EXPECTATIONS 
AND IT'S IMPORTANT 
THAT WE MEET 
IT'S 
IT'S NOT EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE RISING 
SURELY AT THE MOMENT IT'S THE 
HORROR OF WHAT THEY SEE HAPPENING 
AROUND 
THEM TO 
MORTGAGES TO 
INTEREST RATES FOR THE LOWER PAID 
WITH THE TEN PER CENT TAX RATE FOR 
W. I. I 
PEOPLE BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY FOUR ON 
PENSIONS WHO SUDDENLY LOST OUT 
UNDER A 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
TODAY AS BEING REFERRED TO WITH 
OLD OL I OLS ARE GOING 
TO HAVE TO PAY FOUR HUNDRED TO I TOTAX RUNNING AN OLD BANGER THEY'RE 
THE PEOPLE 
WHO B. A. I 
WORRIED 
WELL THERE ARE HUGE WORRIED CHALLENGES AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT 
C. H. I THOSE 
AROUND THE 
ECONOMY ARE THE 
CHALLENGES OF THE 
MOMENT IN 
A SENSE 
BUT DAVID IF YOU THIS 
REGION AT THE HUGE CHANGES THAT 
THERE HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST 
YEARS THOSE CHANGES ARE 
SIGNIFICANT THAT YES THERE ARE 
PROBLEMS NOW BUT WE DON'T HAVE 
ANYTHING LIKE OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT THAT WE HAD BUT THAT 
IS WHERE AS I SAY PEOPLE'S 
EXPECTATIONS ARE RISING THEY 
ACCEPT NOW THAT STABLE EMPLOYMENT 
AND STABLE LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT 
YOU KNOW WE'VE REDUCED THOSE 
HUGELY IN THIS REGION THEY WANT TO 
THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO 
GO BACK FROM THAT AND SO YES 
THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE I 
ECONOMY WORLDWIDE 
I MIGHT SAY AND 
ECONOMY WORLDWIDE I MIGHT SAY AND THIS ECONOMY WITH THIS PRIME 
MINISTER WHO HAS LED THAT ECONOMY 
SO AS WELL OVER THE SO WELL OVER 
THE 
LAST ELEVEN 
YEARS WE'VE JUST 
TO MAKE 
TO MAKE SURE THAT 
WE KEEP HOLD IT 
THE ECONOMY 
DON'T 
LET DON'T LET 
GO INTO 
RECESSION AND KEEP WORKING WITH 
PEOPLE 
BUT HILARY ARMSTRONG IF PEOPLE YOU TALK ABOUT 
BUT YOU CAN'T BE 
IN GOVERNMENT 
WAIT A SECOND YOU 
TALK ABOUT THE 
CHANGES IN 
THE 
NORTH EAST YOU 
TALK ABOUT 
THE 
NORTH EAST YOU TALK ABOUT THE REGENERATION 
AREA IT MUST 
BE DIMAYING DISMAYING TO YOU THAT OVERALL THE RESULT OF THIS 
T. H. I 
A TWENTY PER CENT GAP BETWEEN THE CONSERVATIVES 
VES I 
AND LABOUR 
THAT WHATEVER'S 
AND LABOUR THAT WHATEVER'S HAPPENING THE CONSERVATIVES ARE 
GETTING FORTY FOUR PER CENT TONIGHT AND LABOUR TWENTY FOUR PER CENT 
PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO THE 
CONSERVATIVES 
YOU CAN'T BE IN CONSERVATIVES GOVERNMENT FOR ALL OF THIS TIME 
WITHOUT PEOPLE 
LOOKINGLE LOOKING 
DIFFERENT THINGS FROM YOU AND 
LOOKING FOR NEW THINGS FROM YOU 
I'VE HAD THE EXAMPLE I THINK I'VE 
HAD A CONSERVATIVE ELECTED IN MY 
CONSTITUENCY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG BUT 
TO AYOU HAD TO WORK VERY HARD TO 
WORK OUT SHE WAS A TORY SHE HAD 
THE BEST LITERATURE 
I'VE EVER 
SEEN 
AND HER SLOGAN WAS AN I 
AND HER SLOGAN WAS NO POLITICS 
NO SPIN NO PROMISES WELL YOU 
KNOW AS I 
SAY YOU 
HAD TO WORK OUT 
HARD SHE WAS A CONSERVATIVE AND 
WHAT SHE 
PEOPLE ARE 
WHAT SHE LEARNED WAS PEOPLE ARE REALLY RATHER DISAFFECTED WITH 
POLITICS AND 
SO SHE APPEALED TO 
POLITICS AND SO SHE APPEALED TO THAT 
SHE WAS 
ENERGETIC SHE WAS YOUNG AND ALL OF 
THOSE THINGS BUT MOST OF THEM 
I

WITH HIS PARTY THAN HE USED TO BE 
HE FIRST OF ALL WON 
AS A MAVERICK ANTI LABOUR CANDIDATE AND THIS TIME 
WITH BOTH 
GORDON BROWN AND TONY BLAIR AND 
HE'S VERY MUCH A LABOUR CANDIDATE 
HE'S MADE HIS PEACE WITH 
THE LABOUR PARTY AND HAS EXTRACTED 
LARGE SUMS OF MONEY OUT OF THE 
TREASURY IN RECENT YEARS WHEN 
GORDON BROWN WAS THERE TO PAY FOR 
HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO 
PAY FOR CROSSRAIL TO PAY FOR A LOT 
OF MONEY 
ON THE TUBE AND THE BUSES 
AND THAT KIND OF THING 
I ARY 
EXTRAORDINARY GIVEN 
HOW LONG 
MICHAEL'S EARLIER POINT TO IT 
TOOK THE TORY PARTY TO FIND 
CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR THAT THEY 
COULD UNSEAT THE INCUMBENT 
CO I

THE GREENS ARE DOWN 
FROM THEIR POSITION IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND 
LOWER THAN YOU WERE LAST YEAR

THE BIG STORY IS 
NORWICH WE HAVE WON THREE SEATS IN 
NORWICH AND OVERTAKEN THE LIBERAL 
L. 
DEMOCRATS WE 
ARE JUST TWO SEATS 
DEMOCRATS WE ARE JUST TWO SEATS BEHIND LABOUR AND ARE NOW THE

GOVERNING PARTY 
IN NORWICH THE 
GREENS ABOUT POLED LABOUR IF 
THOSE RESULTS WERE REPLICATED IN 
THE INLAND NEXT GENERAL ELECTION 
T. H. I D. THEXT GENERAL ELECTION CHARLES CLARKE WOULD LOSE HIS SEAT 
THAT IS A VERY ENCOURAGING SIGN 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT NORWICH THEN 
THINK THE 
LOCAL 
THERE 
HAS BEEN 
VERY SOLID WITH VERY 
HAS BEEN VERY SOLID WITH VERY IMAGINATIVE POLICIES THEY HAVE 
COME UP WITH LOCAL INITIATIVES ON 
GREEN ISSUES HOUSING AND 
AS WELL AS EIGHT AS JUSTICE THIS

RESTORE THAT 
TORE THATE 
BUILD 
ON THAT WE JUST HAVE TO 
MAKE SURE 
THAT WE GET THE MESSAGE OUT AND 
SHARPEN OUR MESSAGE TO LOCAL VOTERS 
ABOUT THE INITIATIVES THAT WE D. 
BOUGHT IN 
YOU DO NOT HAVE A LEAHAVE 
TO THINK 
BE BETTER IF YOU 
HAD A LEADER THAT 
HA EIGHT 
THE 
PARTY SOMEWHERE INSTEAD 
PISTE SHAMBLES OF WHAT 
CALLED WE LACK 
TYPICALLY ARE TY EIGHT TYE A 
TYPICALLY ARE A DEMOCRATIC NON HIERARCHICAL PARTY MORE DEMOCRATIC 
THAN THE 
OTHAN THE OTH 
FROM NOVEMBER 
WE WILL HAVE A LEADER OR LEADERS WE WILL 
LEADERS WE WILL VOTE ON 
THAT IN NO 
EVENT BAR I'M SURE WE WILL COLLECT 
SOMEONE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO 
THEIR GREEN MESSAGE AND SHOW THAT 
WE ARE A SERIOUS PARTY NOT STAND 
GREEN ISSUES BUT 
CIVIL RIGHTS 
AND SOCIAL JUSTICE NICK SOME 
D. ANUSTICE INTERESTING ANALYSIS ABOUT WHERE 
LABOUR'S VOTE IS FALLING MOST AND 
IT IS FALLING MOST IN ITS HEARTLAND 
DOWN BY FIVE PER CENT IN 
SEATS BE DIFFICULT USED IN 
THE LABOUR PARTY SAYING THAT 
HAVE ABANDONED OUR CORE BOAT THE 
PEOPLE THAT WE SHOULD BE HELPING 
I 
I THINK NICKY IS RIGHT YOU COULD 
READ THOSE FIGURES 
TWOIGURES TWO 
READ THOSE FIGURES TWO WAYS 
I 
REPRESENT HEARTLAND SEATS WAS OUT 
THERE TODAY 
AND AND OU EIGHT 
RURAL CONCERNS ABOUT FIVE FINANCES 
NEXT DOOR TO ME WE HAVE A SEAT 
WHERE BEACON SERVICE ABSOLUTELY 
NEED TO 
MAKEED TO MAKE 
N. E. EIGHT 
NEED TO MAKE INROADS AND BACK 
AT 
GO CONSERVATIVE TONIGHT 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE SEATS WHICH 
PEOPLE ALWAYS LOOK 
TO.S LOOK TO 
HAS 
PEOPLE ALWAYS LOOK TO IT HAS NOT GONE AND WE 
GO EIGHT 
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THAT 
A WAS VERY 
E. R. Y. EIGHT ED 
ON THAT YOU 
DID NOT SAY 
EARLIER ON 
THAT LABOUR 
DID NOT SAY EARLIER ON THAT LABOUR IT SHOULD LISTEN BECAUSE 
THAT HAS 
BEEN BE COLLECTED SOUNDS FROM 
LABOUR POLITICIANS WHAT YOU DID 
SAY WAS THAT WE HAVE TO 
THE RIGHT WAY AND ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT I HAVE 
NOT BEEN 
PICKING UP 
AMATEUR 
PIG OTHERS 
HAVE BEEN 
PICKING UP IS WHAT WOULD THE RIGHT 
RESPONSE BE WHAT IS IT THAT THE 
PRIME MINISTER AND THE 
CABINET AND 
COLLEAGUES WHAT SHOULD THEY BE 
DOING NOT 
DURING 
WHICH 
MIGHT MAKE 
A DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN NOW AND TWO THOUSAND TEN 
THAT IS THE 
PHRASE I USED BECAUSE THAT SAYS 
FOR ME L. THINK WE NEED TO REFLECT 
AND RESPOND IN THE RIGHT WAY NOT 
BE ARROGANT TAKE THE RESULTS ON 
THE CHIN AND COME BACK WITH 
PROPOSALS WHICH RESPOND TO THE 
DIFFERENT 
DI EIGHT DISUES 
THIS IS 
TO BE DISCUSSED 
BY THE 
CABINET FOR 
US TO 
COME BACK I THINK YOU'LL SEE 
US TO COME BACK I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT 
THEREAT THERE 
ALREADY IDEAS THAT 
COLLEAGUES ARE BRINGING FORWARD L. THINK WE ARE GOING TO 
MOVE INTO 
A 
PHASE WHERE THERE IS SPRAY CLEARLY 
A FIGHT AND THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
WILL BE UNDER MORE SCRUTINY L. DO 
NOT THINK IF YOU ARE SOMEONE ON THE 
STREET ARE TODAY BUT THEY 
NAME A CONSERVATIVE PARTY L. THINK 
WHAT WE'RE SAYING LATELY IS 
REBRANDING BRANDING WE HAVE NOT 
ACTUALLY SEEN PEOPLE SUBJECTING P. 
CONSERVATIVES TO SCRUTINY JEREMY JEREMY HAS OUR FAVOURITE LITTLE SEEN TO 
END THE EVENING THAT IS NOT JEREMY 
PLANNING LEFT PRETTY CENTRAL LOBBY 
LEFT TO THE COMMONS DONE TO THE 
REPORTER HAS LOBBIED AND YOU FIND 
ME HERE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
AND WE WILL HAVE A LOOK 
PROJECT AND NATIONAL SHARE LET US 
FIRST HAVE A LOOK AT WHO IS THERE 
AT THE MOMENT THIS MARKED DOWN 
HERE IS THE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR HOUR MARK PASS 
WHICH WHICH A PARTY MUST GO TO HAVE 
A MAJORITY LABOUR THE 
SINGLE PARTY THE CONSERVATIVES 
WITH ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO LIB DEMS WITH SIXTY THREE AND THE 
OTHER M. P.'S AND THAT ADDS UP TO A 
MAJORITY A LABOUR MAJORITY OF SIXTY SIX 
SEATS BY HIS EXISTING HOUSE OF 
COMMONS THESE 
ARE PEOPLE 
WHO 
ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE PUT US TAKE PROJECTED NATIONAL PR EIGHT PRTIONAL SHARE 
PROJECTED NATIONAL SHARE AND FIND 
OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE 
EXTRAPOLATED FROM THE 
ELECTIONS AND PUT IT INTO THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS BIGGEST PARTY HAVE RTY 
GUESS THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
PAST THE MAJORITY WITH THREE HUNDRED NINETY FAUCETS 
BY FAR THE LARGEST SINGLE PARTY IN 
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND VERY EASY 
TO GOVERN WITHOUT ASSISTANCE WHO 
ELSE EL EIGHT EL AROUND LABOUR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE 
IT SEATS MUCH REDUCED DOWN TO THE 
CONSERVATIVE LEVA LEVEL IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
WE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE 
THE LEADERS GORDON BROWN DAVID 
CAMERON SITTING AND WAITING TO 
DISCUSS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN 
DAVID CAMERON OR TO BE HAPPY 
WITH A 
CLEAR MAJORITY OFF YOUR RAN 
AGAINST THE LEADERSHIP 
WOULD SHE 
HAVE ANOTHER TRY NOW 
THE ROLES ARE 
NOW YOU NEED DOUBLE THE AMOUNT SO 
DON'T THINK SO THIS TIME 
DO YOU 
THINK THERE SHOULD 
BE A 
CHALLENGE 
TO THE LEADERSHIP I THINK PART OF 
THE 
PROBLEME PROBLEM 
THAT WE DID NOT HAVE 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE A LEADERSHIP DEBATE LAST YEAR THE 
TEN P. 
ISSUE HAS 
BEEN COMING UP TIME 
AND TIME AGAIN SO I WOULD LIKE A 
DEBATE ON DE EIGHT DEXATION DO NOT WANT 
TO BE SEEN AS INCREASING TAXES FOR 
POOR PEOPLE 
DO YOU THINK THAT 
GORDON BROWN WOULD CHANGED TACK 
NOW OR TO THINK HE WILL CARRY ON 
AS HIS 
HE PROMISED CHANGE AND 
THOSE CHANGES HAVE NOT COME 
SO I THINK THAT IS WHY THERE IS D. SOHAT IS WHY THERE IS DISILLUSIONED LISTENING IS NO GOOD 
UNLESS YOU ACT SO THERE HAS TO BE A 
MAJOR POLICY CHANGE 
THERE HAS BEEN 
A MAJOR LOSS IN WALES LABOUR DOWN 
THIRTEEN IN ONE'S 
SEAT CONCERN 
IS UP 
FIVE AND LIB DEMS UP ONE 
LIKE A 
DISASTER FOR 
LAID BACK IN WALES TONIGHT WE 
CERTAINLY THE PICTURE OF LABOUR 
LOSING ITS HEART MIND HERE TONIGHT 
THE ONLY CITY THAT LABOUR HELD UP 
WELL L. THINK WE NOW HAVE THE ANSWER 
AND THE 
ANSWER IS CLEARLY YES WE ARE COMING TO 
THE END 
OF YES THIS BUT TONY KING IS SAID AFTER 
ABOUT AN HOUR OF THIS PROGRAMME 
THAT THIS WILL BE A TRADE TRULY 
DREADFUL NIGHT FOR LABOUR AND THAT 
IS TRUE ISN'T IT 
THEY ARE 
TERRIBLE RESULTS FOR LABOUR BUT 
THEY ARE MIXED RESULTS AND I THINK 
WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RESULTS 
TOMORROW AND SEE WHAT THEY MEAN 
OVERALL THEY ARE DISAPPOINTING FOR 
LABOUR 
RANK AND FILE LABOUR LABOUR ACTIVISTS AND M. P.'S ARE SAYING THE 
SAME THING 
IF WE 
TRY AND INTRIGUE 
INTERPRETEINTERPRETE 
INTERPRETER IT 
THAT WAY WE 
IN I D. INIT THAT WAY WE SLEEPWALK 
TOWARDS A 
CONSERVATIVE 
SLEEPWALK TOWARDS A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE BOUNCED BACK 
FROM BAD LOCAL ELECTION RESULTS WE 
ALL FEAR IT BOUNCING INTO A 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT IT IS 
ABOUT CHANGING POLICIES 
I HAVE TO 
AGREE WITH WHAT 
EVERYBODY HAS 
AGREE WITH WHAT EVERYBODY HAS SAYING A DREADFUL NIGHT FOR THE 
LABOUR PARTY AND IT HAS BEEN 
A VERY 
LABOUR PARTY AND IT HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD NIGHT FOR THE CONSERVATIVES 
NO GETTING AROUND THAT 
THE LABOUR 
PARTY HAS NO MEMORY OF A SITUATION 
LIKE THIS AND NO WAY TO DO 
THERE IS NO SUGGESTION OF WHAT 
DO ABOUT IT NO DO EIGHT WHAT 
THEY SHOULD TO TOMORROW THEY HAVE THE RESULTS FROM LONDON AND

THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH IS ON THE

IT'S TAKING PLACE THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE HAVE 
TURNED UP TO SUPPORT 
THE FLAME ON ITS JOURNEY THROUGH 
CHINA YOU CAN SEE THE FLAME THERE 
BEING CARRIED MANY PEOPLE WEARING 
RED TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE

NATION AND ALSO AS 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH GOES THROUGH THE 
STREETS OF HONG ST I STONG KONG 
CONTROVERSIAL ONLY TODAY THIS 
WEEK THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER CALL FOR 
JEWISH J. E. I JEE THE WORLD 
TO BOYCOTT THE BEIJING GAMES THIS 
COMES FROM 
OF INFLUENTIAL 
COMES FROM A GROUP OF INFLUENTIAL JEWISH LEADERS HERE IN 
THE UNITED 
STATES ONE OF THOSE IS DOCTOR RAFAEL 
MEDOV DIRECTOR OF THE DAVID S. 
WYMAN INSTITUTE FOR HOLOCAUST 
STUDIES I ASKED WHY HE BELIEVED 
THE 
OLYMPICS SHOULD BE SNUBBED THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO USE THE A WAY TO WHITEWASH ITS 
IMAGE AND DISTRACT THE WORLD FROM 
ITS ABUSES WHETHER IN 
TIBET OR 
ITS 
IT I SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN SUDAN 
OR THE MISSILES IT PROVIDES TO IRAN 
RAN I 
AND SYRIA 
AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR 
AMERICANS TO STAND UP AND PROTEST 
AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT CHINESE

BEHAVIOUR IS 
UNACCEPTABLE 
WHAT W. H. I W. H. ACHIEVE HOW WOULD 
BOYCOTT HELP THE HUMAN RIGHTS

THAT WE SHOULDN'T MIX 
POLITICS AND SPORT 
INCLUDING THE 
SECRETARY GENERAL OF ISRAEL'S 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
WHO SAID THERE 
ARE FORUMS FOR THESE KINDS OF

THE PROBLEM IS THAT BEIJING IS 
USING THE OLYMPICS AS A US I 
USING THE OLYMPICS AS A GRAND STAGE 
ON 
WHICH TO 
ON I ONPRETTY UP 
OWN IMAGE 
AND MAKE 
THE WORLD FORGET

END OF 
TWO THOUSAND IX 
SOMALIA UNTIL THE END OF TWO THOUSAND IX WHEN ETHOPIAN TROOPS BACKED BY THE

THE CHAOS HAS BEEN A DRAWN FOR AL

MILITANTS INCLUDING SOME BROTONS 
AT PRESENT SECURITY FORCES BELIEVE 
DOZENS NOT HUNDREDS ARE TRAVELLING 
FROM THE U. K. TO TRAIN IN 
SOMALIA IT COULD GROW AND THE

AGAINST BRITAIN 
I 
THIS MORNING'S 
MISSILE STRIKE MAY 
THIS MORNING'S MISSILE STRIKE MAY HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ELIMINATEING SENIOR 
COMMANDER BUT 
THAT IS 
UNLIKELY TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT ON 
SOMALIA'S UNDERLYING FRUJIELT AND 
THE DANGERS IT MAY FRAGILITY ASK 
THE DANGERS IT MAY POSE ALSO IN 
SOMALIA UNITED NATIONS EXPERTS ARE 
WARNING THE COUNTRY IS FACING A 
MAJOR 
FAMINEJOR FAMINE 
OF DROUGHT AND 
MAJOR FAMINE BECAUSE O. BECAUSE OAND SOARING FOOD PRICES THE UNITED 
NATIONS SAYS UP TO THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION 
COULD NEED FOOD AID BY THE END OF 
THE YEAR IT SAYS 
HYPE SAYS HYPE 
AND THE WAR ARE MAKING IT MORE MORE DIFFICULT FOR POOR PEOPLE MO I 
GET ENOUGH TO EAT PRESIDENT G. E. I 
W. BUSH W. I W. MORE THAN 
THREE QUARTER OF BILLION IN 
INTERNATIONAL FOOD AID TO COMBAT 
THE EFFECTS OF SOARING FOOD PRICES 
IT HAS 
RIOTING IN POORER 
COUNTRIES WITH THREAT OF MUCH 
MORE TO COME IN THE POOREST 
COUNTRIES 
IN THE 
WORLD WHERE 
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED HAND TO 
MOUTH THE SURGING COST OF FOOD IS 
MAKING AN 
ALKING AN AL 
MAKING AN ALREADY DIFFICULT EXISTENCE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE EX I 
EXISTENCE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THE PRICE OF ESSENTIALS LIKE RICE 
SUGAR AND COOKING OIL IS MOVING 
EVER FUTHER OUT OF 
FORTNIGHT AGO THE U. S. RELEASED TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS 
MILLION TO HELP EASE THE NOW GEORGE W. 
BUSH IS 
CALLING ON 
CONGRESS TO APPROVE ANOTHER CO I 
QUARTORS AFFBILLION FOR FOOD AID 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GENEROUS 
AND COMPASSIONATE WE BELIEVE THE 
TRUTH TO MUCH WHOM IS T. R. I 
EXPECTED SO 
WE 
MAKE SURE 
THE 
NEEDIEST CAN COPE WITH THE RISING 
FOOD PRICES AT HOME IT WITH 
INTERNATIONAL FUNDING INTERNATIONATERNATIONAWE 
SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE AMERICA 
WILL LEAD THE FIGHTS AGAINST HUNNER 
FOR YEARS TO COME 
PRESIDENT GEORGE 
W. BUSH 
AS 
GENEROUS BUT THEY 
ARE FEELING 
THE 
PINCH OF THE FOOD CRISIS TOO YOU YOU HEAR PEOPLE COMPLAINING OF 
PRICES ALMOST AS MUCH AS GAS PRICES 
WHILE GAS PRICES SEEM TO BE THE 
NO ONE ISSUE TODAY I BELIEVE THE 
ANXIETY FELT OVER HIGHER FOOD 
PRICES IS GOING TO BE JUST AS WIDESPREAD THE PRESIDENT'S WIDESPREAD DECISION TO 
TURN VAST 
ACRES OF 
DECISION TO TURN VAST ACRES OF CROPS INTO GREEN FORMS OF FUEL 
RATHER THAN FOOD IS SEEN BY SOME AS 
ONE OF THE 
REASONS BEHIND 
THE 
SOARING PRICES THE SO I SOES THE U. S. 
SOARING PRICES THE U. S. MAY 
GIVE 
AWAY MORE FOOD AID THAN ANYWHERE 
ELSE IN THE WORLD BUT MANY BELIEVE 
THE COUNTRY IS PARTLY TO BLAME FOR 
THE VERY PROBLEM IT IS NOW TRYING 
TO SOLVE JANE HADDIN B. B. C. NOW

YOU BRING 
OCCUPIED TERRITORIES DO YOU BRING AN OPEN MIND TO THAT JOB 
YES I 
BRING A PROFESSIONAL BR I BRESSIONAL BACKGROUND 
BRING A PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND BASED ON SEEKING TO LOOK B. A. I 
TRUTH AND TO RESPECT EVIDENCE IT'S 
PART OF MY LEGAL TRAINING AND PART 
PA I OF MY COMMITMENT TO TRUTH TELLING 
AS PART OF BEING A CITIZEN AND 
BEING A TRAINED 
BUT I ASKED YOU ABOUT AN OPEN MIND 
DO DOO 
YOU BRING 
AN OPEN MIND OR 
DO DOO YOU BRING AN OPEN MIND OR HAVE YOU ALREADY MADE KEY 
ASSUMPTIONS AABOUT THE CONFLICT I I BRING AN OPEN MIND BUT A MIND 
IS INFORMED 
BY KNOWLEDGE 
OF THE 
SITUATION WHICH I'VE BEEN 
GATHERING OVER THE YEARS I'VE 
INTERESTED IN THE CONFLICT L. FEEL 
COMMITTED TO WORKING FOR THE 
PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT 
ON BEHALF OF BOTH PEOPLES AND I 
THINK TELLING THE TRUTH IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT WAY OF APPROACHING THOSE 
GOALS BUT 
WHAT IS 
THE TRUTH IS GOALS IT THE TRUTH TO AS YOU DID 
EXPLOSIVE ARTICLE LESS THAN A 
AGO ENTITLED SLOUCHING TOWARD A 
PALESTINIAN HOLOCAUST 
IS 
IT THE 
TRUTH TO ACCUSE THE ISRAELIS OF 
CONDUCTING A HOLOCAUST AGAINST THE 
HE PALESTINIANS I DIDN'T ACCUSE THE PALESTINIANS ISRAELIS OF 
DOING THAT 
L. 
ISRAELIS OF DOING THATDOING THATTED 
ISRAELIS OF DOING THAT I SUGGESTED THAT THE POLICIES THAT 
WERE BEING 
PURSUED HAD THAT IMPLICATION IT'S 
A SOUND BYTE TO JUST TAKE THOSE 
SOMEWHAT 
INFMEWHAT INF 
WHICH I 
SOMEWHAT INFLAMMATORY WORDS WHICH I IN RETROSPECT HAVING USED IN THAT 
T. 
CONTEXT BUT 
IT WAS MY EFFORT TO 
SUGGEST TO THE AUDIENCE I HAD THAT 
THE SITUATION WAS SO SERIOUS AND SO 
DESPERATE THAT ONE NEEDED 
TO OF WORLD PUBLIC OPINION THIS 
IS RATHER 
OPINION THIS IS RATHER IMPORTANT STUFF ISN'T IT L. WANT TO 
BE PLAIN 
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND WHAT YOU 
HAVE BELIEVED IN THE RECENT PAST 
IN THAT ARTICLE LESS THAN A YEAR 
AGO YOU WROTE AND AG I 
AGO YOU WROTE AND I'M QUOTING 
IS IT AN OVERSTATEMENT TO 
ASSOCIATE THE TREATMENT OF THE 
PALESTINIANS WITH PALESTINIANSLESTINIANS NAZI RECORD OF COLLECTIVE NA I 
I THINK NOTTING NOT YES YES THOSE WORDS IN T. H. I THIN A 
CONTEXT 
WERE MY EFFORT TO EXPRESS A WE I 
OF WHAT LAID BENEATH THOSE POLICIES 
THAT ARE BEING APPLIED TO GAZA L. 
THINK THE REVERBERATIONS THAT ARE 
SUGGESTED SU I SU WORDS MAY HAVE BEEN DISTRACTING 
IN A 
WAY THAT I 
BEEN DISTRACTING IN A WAY THAT I REGRET IN RETROSPECT MYANE 
INTENTION WAS TO CALL 
THE FACTS AND T. H. I T. H. D. THE 
THE FACTS AND THE RELATION 
OF THOSE 
FACTS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF ISRAEL 
AS THE OCCUPYING POWER 
I'M SORRY 
I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR WHAT 
SAYING ARE SA I SAYOU WHAT YOU SAID YOU ALSO SAID THAT 
ISRAEL HAD 
GENOCIDEAL TENDENCIES ARE YOU 
ENTIRELY DISOWNING THESE VERY 
IMPORTANT IM I IMRDS YOU WROTE LESS 
THAN A YEAR AGO 
NO WHAT I'M 
TRYING TO 
SAYING TO SA 
YOU STEPHEN IS 
THAT THOSE WORDS ARE DISTRACTIONS 
FROM THE UNDERLYING REALITY THEY 
HAVE HIS HORICAL ASSOCIATIONS WHICH 
MAY BE MISLEADING MA I MAADING IN 
CONTEXT 
T. 
WHAT I 
DID FEEL WAS THIS WAS A 
MASSIVE INSTANCE OF CLEBTIVE 
PUNISHMENT THAT IT WAS 
COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT THAT IT WAS 
NOT JUSTIFIED 
THERE WERE 
CEASEFIRE 
ALTERNATIVES AND THAT IT WAS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO TERMINATE THE APPROACH 
THAT ISRAEL 
AT ISRAEL 
TO GAZA IN 
THE PERIOD SINCE THE 
EINCE THE E. 
HAMAS IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND SIX 
BUT WE'RE 
NOT ENGAGED 
IN AN 
ACADEMIC EXERCISE 
HERE YOU 
NOW HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT 
AND VERY SENSITIVE RESPONSIBILITY 
I WANT SOME PLAIN SPEAKING DO YOU 
OR DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT ISRAEL'S 
POLICIES REFLECT GENOCIDEAL 
TENDENCIES 
I WAS WRITING THAT TENDENCIES ARTICLE AS 
AN ENGAGED 
CITIZEN I'M 
I'M SORRY I'M GOING TO HAVE TO STOP 
YOU BECAUSE I REALLY DO FEEL IT'S 
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR YOU TO 
ANSWER I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT 
YOUR MINDSET WHEN YOU WROTE THAT 
ARTICLE I 
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOU 
TODAY DO YOU BELIEVE NOW THAT 
ISRAEL IS PURSUING POLICIES THAT 
REFLEBT GENOCIDEAL TENDENCIES REFLECT GENOCIDEAL TENDENCIES WHAT 
I'M TRYING TO EXPRESS TO YOU IS 
THAT I AM KEEPING AN OPEN MIND L. 
DON'T DISOWN WHAT I SAID IN THE 
PAST BUT IT WAS IN A DIFFERENT 
CONTEXT I'M NOW PREPARED TO LOOK 
AT WHAT THE FACTS 
TELL ME 
AND TO 
TRY TO REPORT 
ON THE 
EVIDENCE AS 
WELL AS I CAN AND WE I WEN AND TO 
WELL AS I CAN AND TO INTERPRET 
EVIDENCE BY REFERENCE TO 
INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW ON 
THE BASIS OF WHAT 
IN 
THE 
PAST YOU CAN MAKE CERTAIN 
INFERENCES 
FROM THAT 
BUT THAT'S NOT 
MY MINDSET 
AT THE 
PRESENT TIME 
YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION AS OUTLINED YO I 
THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL REMIT 
SAYS THE INDEPENDENT STATUS IS 
CRUCIAL IN ORDER TO BE 
ABLE TO 
CRUCIAL IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FULFIL THEIR FUNCTIONS IN ALL 
IMPARTIALITY IMPARTIALITYPARTIALITY MAKE YOU'VE BEEN 
U'VE BEEN 
THAT 
JOB DESCRIPTION 
WELL I HOPE SO 
I'M APPOINTED NOT ON THE BASIS OF 
ONE JOURNALISTIC ARTICLE WRITTEN AT 
A TIME WHEN I FELT QUITE DISTURBED 
BY WHAT I UNDERSTOOD TO BE 
HAPPENING ON 
THE GROUND 
IF YOU 
LOOK AT MY WHOLE CAREER AND MY 
I 
BACKGROUND MY 
COMMITMENT ON MANY 
OTHER ISSUES I THINK YOU WOULD SEE 
THAT I HAVE TRIED TO BE OBJECTIVE 
E. 
I HAVE 
TRIED TO REPORT UNPOPULAR 
TRUTHS AS WELL T. R. I TRLL AS 
WISDOM WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE AND I 
THINK THAT'S THE BASIS FOR MY 
I 
SELECTION THIS 
INFORMED 
PROFESSIONAL APPROACH 
TO 
PROFESSIONAL APPROACH TO CONTROVERSIAL SENSITIVE POLITICAL 
REALITIES 
LET ME PUSH YOU ON REALITIES SOMETHING YOU JUST SAID YOU SAID 
YOU WROTE THAT PIECE AND IT'S NOT 
THE ONLY PIECE YOU'VE WRITTEN THAT 
HAD HIH A SIMILAR TENOR YOU SAID 
YOU WROTE IT WHEN YOUR MIND WAS 
I 
DISTURBED NOTHING 
MUCH DIFFERENT 
IS HAPPENING ON THE 
TODAY IS YOUR MIND STILL DISTURBED 
IT IS DISTURBED BY WHAT DISTURBED I KNOW BUT AS I SAY PART OF MY 
ROLE IS TO GET RID OF THOSE 
PRECONCEPTIONS AND TO LOOK AT THE 
EVIDENCE AS OPENLY AND AS 
OBJECTIVELY AS I CAN AND I THINK 
MY TRAINING AND MY I MYAND BACKGROUND 
PREPARE ME TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT 
IS IMPARTIAL AND I DO CARE FOR THE 
WELL BEING OF BOTH PEOPLES AND HOPE 
THAT MY CONTRIBUTION WILL BE THAT DOES HELP TO CLARIFY WHAT THE REALITY 
IS AND 
REALITY IS AALITY IS A 
BE 
REALITY IS AND HOW IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD FROM AN INTERNATIONAL 
LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS POINT OF VIEW 
YOU'VE INDICATED IN THIS INTERVIEW 
AND INDEED BEFORE THAT PART OF YOUR 
INTENTION WHEN YOU WROTE THAT 
ARTICLE WAS AND I'M QUOTING TO 
WAKE AMERICA FROM ITS TOPPER TO 
USE EXTRAORDINARY LANGUAGE AND 
KNOW HOW EXTRAORDINARY YOUR 
LANGUAGE WAS FOR EFFECT ARE YOU 
STILL IN THE BUSINESS OF USING 
EXTRAORDINARY LANGUAGE FOR EFFECT 
AS I TRIED TO EXPLAIN EARLIER 
STEPHEN THAT WAS 
PIECE WRITTEN IN I 
FELT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT 
ATTENTION BEING GIVEN ESPECIALLY 
IN THE U. S. TO THIS ISSUE ONE 
NEEDED TO 
SHOUT TO 
NEEDED TO SHOUT TO BE HEARD 
MAYBE 
NEEDED TO SHOUT TO BE HEARD MAYBE SHOUTING WASN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO 
EXPRESS MY DEEP CONCERN BUT 
WAS A DIFFERENT ROLE L. WAS WRITING 
AS A CITIZEN NOT AS A 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTATIPRESENTATIINTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND I ROLE 
SERIOUSLY AND 
THE LANGUAGE 
OF THE MANDATE SERIOUSLY AND I 
WOULDN'T HAVE ACCEPTED THE POSITION 
IF 
THINK I COULD FULFIL 
IN AN IMPARTIAL WAY 
YOU MUST 
REGRET NOW THAT YOU WROTE THAT 
I PIECE I REGRET THAT IT'S BEEN PIECE INTERPRETED THE WAY IT HAS AND I 
I 
REALISE THAT 
WE 
RE I 
IN A 
SOUND BYTE MEDIA WORLD 
THEREFORE ONE NEEDS TO CAREFUL THAN I HAD 
C. A. I 
CAREFUL THAN I HAD BEEN IN EXPRESSING THIS CONCERN AND 
DON'T KNOW HOW I SHOULD HAVE 
WRITTEN IT 
I WOULD 
HAVE TO RETHINK 
THAT BUT I REALISE THAT IT HAS 
BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD INNOCENTLY 
PART AND I THINK DELIBERATELY 
DISTORTED IN PART TO DISCREDIT ME IN YOUR ROLE HOW 
DI I DI IN YOUR ROLE HOW IMPORTANT 
IS IT 
U. 
AN 
IMPORTANT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE AN ENGAGED AND ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH 
THE STATE OF ISRAEL 
I THINK IT'S 
VERY IMPORTANT AND I WOULD HOPE TO 
BE ABLE TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF 
THOSE IN 
THE ISRAELI 
GOVERNMENT 
THOSE IN THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT THAT WANT THE TRUTH TO BE TOLD L. L. 
AM COMMITTED TO TELLING THE TRUTH 
TO REPORTING ON THE EVIDENCE TO 
INTERPRETING THE LAW NOW WHETHER 
THAT IS 
SOMETHING 
THAT WILL 
PERSUADE PE I PE 
GOVERNMENT TO 
ACCEPT AS 
ACCEPT AS A BASIS 
OF DEALING 
ME I CAN'T PREDICT AT THIS POINT 
I JUST HOPE 
THAT THEY WILL I THAT MY REASSURANCES THAT I 
TO BE IMPARTIAL THAT ONE CAN 
IGNORE WHAT 
I'VE SAID 
IN THE PAST 
AND THAT I WILL LIVE AN I ANILL LIVE UP 
MY 
PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION AS SOMEONE 
PROFESSIONALOFESSIONALN AS SOMEONE THAT IS IMPARTIAL AND OBJECTIVE IN 
DOING THIS KIND OF JOB 
THEY CURRENTLY ISSUE YOU WITH VISA THEY 
WON'T TALK 
TO YOU AND I 
SUPPOSE YOU'RE PROBABLY 
SURPRISED BY THAT ARE YOU 
I AM 
IT BUT I THINK 
NOT SURPRISED BY IT BUT I THINK THAT IT TROUBLES ME THAT THEY HAVE 
TAKEN THIS EXTRAORDINARY STEP TO 
LIMIT MY CAPACITY TO BE EFFECTIVE 
IN THE ROLE THAT I HAVE BEEN 
SELECTED TO 
PLAY 
IS IT 
EXTRAORDINARY FOR 
A GOVERNMENT 
EXTRAORDINARY FOR A GOY FOR A GOHO 
YOU'VE ACCUSED OF 
COMPARISON TO THE NAZIS OF HAVING 
GENOCIDEAL TEND AERPBSS 
IS IT 
GENOCIDEAL TEND AERPBSS IS IT EXTRAORD TENDENCIES IS 
EXTRAORDINARY FOR THEM TO VIEW YOU 
AS SOMEONE ABSOLUTELY UNQUALIFIED 
TO COME 
THEIR HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD 
WELL AS I RI I RID 
RIGHTS RECORD YOU'RE YO I YO I YO ENTIRE IMAGE ON 
THAT BIT OF LANGUAGE THAT WAS 
EMBEDDED IN A MUCH BROADER EM I EMA MUCH BROADER ARGUMENT 
EMBEDDED IN A MUCH BROADER ARGUMENT THAT INCLUDED 
SUGGESTID SUGGESTI 
THAT INCLUDED SUGGESTING THAT 
T. H. I T. H. D. SUGGESTING THAT THERE 
THAT INCLUDED SUGGESTING THAT THERE WERE POSSIBILITIES OF ACLEAVING 
I 
ISRAELI SECURITY 
BY EXPLORING THE 
ISRAELI SECURITY BY EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITIES 
OF A 
CEASEFIRE THAT 
POSSIBILITIES OF A CEASEFIRE THAT HAMAS HAD SUFFERED BY 
FERED BY 
HAMAS HAD SUFFERED BY TRYING TO 
OFFERED BY TRYING TO DISTINGUISH 
BETWEEN GENERAL SECURITY CONCERNS 
AND PUPBSING THE ENTIRE POPULATION 
OF GAZ PUNISHING 
THNISHING T. H. 
OF GAZ PUNISHING THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF GAZA THAT BROADER 
ARGUMENT IT 
SEEMS TO 
NOT 
INFLAMMATORY IF IT'S READ PROPERLY 
BUT IF YOU TAKE MY BRING 
ATTENTION TO THIS SITUATION 
N. 
OF COURSE 
IT DOES SOUND RATHER 
OF COURSE IT DOES SOUND RATHER INFLAMMATORY 
AS YOU SAID IT'S INFLAMMATORY OBVIOUSLY O. B. I OBT 
BRINGT ME BRING 
THE 
ATTENTION OF THE WORLD IT'S ISRAELIS THEIR INITIAL IS I ISEIR INITIAL REACTION 
EARLIER THIS MONTH THE THOUGHT YOU 
WERE ABOUT TO TAKE THIS POST WAS F. 
HE COMPARES 
US TO 
HOW 
FAIR CAN HE BE IT'S 
A TOTAL 
FALSEHOOD AND PERSONAL INSULT TO 
EVERYBODY OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
APPOINT TOO FIND SOMEONE WHO 
COMPARES 
ISTRAIL TO 
THE NAZIS IS 
COMPARES ISTRAIL TO THE NAZIS IS BIZARRE AND DANGEROUS 
AS I'VE 
BEEN TRYING TO SAY I DIDN'T DRAW 
THAT COMPARISON 
WHAT I 
SAID WAS 
THAT SOME OF THE POLICIES BEING 
PURSUED HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE 
RESEMBLANCE AND THAT WAS A VERY 
SERIOUS CAUSE FOR MY CONCERN ABOUT 
WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
IN THE 
REPORTS 
THAT WE T. H. I T. H. FROM GAZA 
CONFIRMED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE 
HUMAN SITUATION THERE THERE IS THE 
REAL 
POSSIBILITY OF 
A HUMAN 
CATASTROPHE AND I THINK AS A 
CITIZEN CONCERNED WITH HUMAN WELL 
BEING IT WAS MY OBLIGATION AT THAT 
POINT TO TRY TO SAY AS CLEARLY AS I 
COULD AND CO I CO WAY THAT WOULD 
ATTRACT ATTENTION NOT THE 
ATTENTION I SOUGHT I DIDN'T SEEK 
ATTENTION FOR THOSE STATEMENTS 
SOUGHT ATTENTION FOR THE SITUATION 
THAT LED ME TO MAKE THOSE 
STATEMENTS 
I UNDERSTAND THAT I STATEMENTS THINK YOU'VE MADE THE POINT LET'S 
MOVE ON BECAUSE I'M JUST THINKING 
IF YOU WERE IF I HAVEN'T GOT 
PERMISSION BUT IF YOU WERE GIVEN 
PERMISSION TO GO TO 
ISRAEL AND 
THE 
OCCUPIED TERRITORIES YOU WOULDN'T 
BE ABLE TO 
INVESTIGATE THE 
IMPACT 
OF THE 
KASSAM ROCKETS THAT ARE 
OF THE KASSAM ROCKETS THAT ARE BEING FIRED EVERY DAY FROM THE GAZA 
STRIP IN TO ISRAEL WOULD YOU 
I I THINK ONE OF MY 
COMMITMENTS TO THE EXTENT THAT I 
HAVE ANY INFLUENCE IN TO 
TRY TO EXPAND THE MANDATE SO IT 
WOULD ALLOW ME TO 
LOOK AT 
WHAT 
PALESTINIANS ARE DOING THAT IS 
VIOLATING INTERNATIONAL THE THE POINT IS THE CURRENT MANDATE 
DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO LOOK AT HUMAN 
RIGHTS ISSUES CONCERNING THE STATE 
OF ISRAEL AND ISRAEL'S CITIZENS 
DOES IT 
WELL THE MANDATE IS 
FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF 
WHAT IS REPORTED UPON IT AND PAST 
PEOPLE IN MY 
PE I 
LOOKED AT 
THESE ISSUES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND 
THE ISRAELI POLICIES IN THEIR 
FULLER SETTING SO I WOULDN'T 
AS RESTRICTED AS YOUR QUESTIONS SUGGEST 
DOES ISRAEL HAVE A RIGHT SUGGEST TO DEFEND ITSELF AS THESE ROCKETS 
COME DOWN 
OF COURSE IT HAS A RIGHT 
TO DEFEND ITSELF BUT ONE NEEDS TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT THE POLICIES THAT 
IT PURSUED AFTER THE 
WERE ONES THAT INCLUDED VIOLENCE 
DIRECTED AT GAZA AND THAT THE 
HAMAS OFFERED 
A CEASEFIRE IN THE 
HAMAS OFFERED A CEASEFIRE IN THE EARLY MONTHS AFTER ITS ELECTION AND 
IT IMPOSED THAT CEASEFIRE ON ITSELF 
EFFECTIVELY FOR THE PERIOD OF 
SEVERAL MONTHS ISRAEL DURING THAT 
PERIOD AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND 
CONTINUED TO 
ENGAGE IN 
TARGETED 
ASSASSINATIONS AND PLACED GREAT 
RESTRAINTS ON THE GAZAN POPULATION 
RE I REN THE GAZAN POPULATION AS A WHOLE 
YOU PORTRAY HAMAS IN 
VARIOUS ARTICLES YOU'VE WRITTEN AS 
EAGER TO ESTABLISH A GOVERNMENT 
REPRESENTATIVE OF REPRESENTATIPRESENTATISTINIANS A 
WHOLE THEY MANAGE RESISTANCE AND 
COMMUNITY SERVICE EFFORTS THAT HAVE 
BEEN WIDELY ADMIRED 
AS A 
WHOLE YOU HAVE A VERY POSITIVE 
VIEW OF HAMAS VI I 
WELL 
WELL IT'S POSITIVE VIEW IN 
THAT I THINK THEY'VE BEEN UNFAIRLY 
CHARACTERICHARACTERI 
CHARACTERISED IN 
WAYS THAT 
CHARACTERISED IN WAYS D. IN WAYS INTERFERE WITH POSSIBILITIES FOR 
ESTABLISHING LESS VIOLENT MORE PEACEFUL PROSPECT FOR BOTH ISRAELIS 
AND FOR 
PALESTINIANS SORRY 
SORRY THERE'S A DELAY ON 
THE LINE 
BUT 
THE LONG RECORD HAMAS HAS OF 
INVOLVEMENT IN 
SUICIDEIN SUICIDE 
INVOLVEMENT IN SUICIDE BOMB 
ATTACKS 
BEGINNING IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES INDEED 
THE KASSAM ROCKET ATTACKS THAT WE 
SEE NOW NONE SE I CONVINCES YOU 
AS AMERICA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION 
ARE CONVINCED THAT HAMAS IS A 
TERRORISTTERRORIST 
TERRORIST ORGANISATION 
I'M NOT 
PREPARED TO MAKE DEFINITIVE 
COMMENT ON THAT WHAT I AM SAYING 
SIMILAR 
TO WHAT 
PRESIDENT JIMMY 
CARTER RECENTLY SAID THAT THERE 
A LONG 
RANGE CEASEFIRE RA I 
RANGE CEASEFIRE THAT THEY HAVE A PRAGMATICALLY ORIENTED LEADERSHIP 
AT THIS STAGE L. 
WORTH 
EXPLORING AND I BEEN A 
MISTAKE NOT TO EXPLORE THE 
POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING THE VIOLENCE 
REDUCING THE SUFFERING ON BOTH 
SIDES REDUCING THE PRESSURE THAT 
HAS BEEN IMPOSED ON GAZA IN THE 
LAST SEVERAL 
LA I 
YOU SEE I'M 
WONDERING AS WE CONDUCT THIS 
INTERVIEW WHEN YOU TALK 
OF HAMAS 
AND ITS COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY 
YOU CALL IT A RESISTANCE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YOUR 
WE I 
WRITINGS WR I WRD WE COME BACK TO 
THIS POINT 
ABOUT IMPARTIALITY ON 
SO MANY ISSUES SO I SOES YOU 
SEEM 
HAVE 
MADE YOUR MIND UP BEFORE YOU'VE 
EVEN MADE ONE SINGLE VISIT TO THE 
REGION IN 
WELL 
WELL YOU'VE BEEN 
ASKING ME 
MY OPINION 
VARIOUS ISSUES I'VE TRIED AS CLEARLY AS 
I CAN 
THAT IN MY 
ROLE I INTEND WITH A FRESH 
MIND AT THESE FACTS TO EVALUATE 
SOME AS CLEARLY AND TRUTHFULLY AS I 
CAN AND TO SERVE AS AN IMPARTIAL 
PERSON IN RELATION TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT'S ALL 
I CAN DO 
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
BACKED BYMANY OTHER GOVERNMENTS 
INCLUDING AN OUTSPOKEN STATEMENT 
FROM THE FRENCH THEY SAY THERE'S A 
FUND WANTAL PROBLEM WITH 
THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS COUNCIL WHICH APPOINTED YOU 
IN THE END THERE'S A RELENTLESS 
PURSUIT 
OF ISRAEL 
AND ITS HUMAN 
PURSUIT OF ISRAEL AND ITS HUMAN RIGHTS FAILINGS AND AN ABILITY TO 
IGNORE HUMAN RIGHTS 
I. G. I 
I. G. RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BEING CONDUCTED BY A HOST OF OTHER 
COUNTRIES WHICH NEVER COME UNDER 
THE SAME 
T. H. I THNDARD 
SCRUTINY 
I THINK THAT SOME CRITICISMS OF THE 
E.

LAID OFF WHEN GROWTH IS SLOWING AS 
IT HAS BEEN OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF 
QUARTERS THEY ALSO ONCE GROWTH 
DOES MORE ANALYSIS NOUN 
FAR 
AS THE JOBS REPORT AS I ASREPORT IS 
WHAT YOU EXPECTING AND WHAT DOES 
THIS SAY ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE 
SLOWDOWN IN THE UNITED STATES TO TO PUT IT INTO CONTEXT IN A RECESSION 
APPROXIMATELY TWICE THAT RATE 
FALLING EMPLOYMENT IS TO BE 
EXPECTED THE SITUATION IS NOT AS 
BAD AS 
IT MIGHT BE IN THE FUTURE

VIEW ON WHERE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST 
ECONOMY IS AT 
THE CURRENT GROWTH 
MOMENTUM IN THE U. S. IS PRETTY WEAK 
ZERO POINT SIX PER CENT WE ARE NOT AS YOU SAY IN

IS THAT IF ONE APPEASES ALL THIS 
TOGETHER IN THE U. S. WE 
AT AN ECONOMY WHICH WILL STRUGGLE 
AND TAKE SOME TIME TO CONVALESCE 
HOW PAINFUL WILL IT BE WE DO 
THINK HE WILL BE IT A 
PARTICULARLY DEEP RECESSION 
CONSUME HER GROWTH ACCOUNTS FOR 
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE WHOLE 
ECONOMY BECAUSE THEY ARE FACING 
BIG PROBLEMS FEAR OF UNEMPLOYMENT 
AND HIGHER 
BILLS ALL 
OF THAT 
SUGGESTS TO US THAT WE ARE BE TALKING ABOUT A 
PERIOD OF 
MANY 
QUARTERS BEFORE WE CAN SEE A TREND 
UPWARDS IN THE U. S. 
IN THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS AND WEEKS MANY OF THESE 
CONSUMERS WILL BE GETTING A TAX
