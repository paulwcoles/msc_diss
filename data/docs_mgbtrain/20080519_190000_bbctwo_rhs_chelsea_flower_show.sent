WHICH HE IS MOST FAMOUS IT IS A 
GARDEN FOR ALL SEASONS BY A 
DESIGNER FOR ALL SEASONS DIARMUID 
GAVIN GAVIN THIS GARDEN HAS A STRONG LAYOUT 
REALLY GOOD GEOMETRY BUT AN 
INFORMAL MOVEMENT THROUGH THE SPACE 
WHICH I REALLY LIKE IT IS CALLED 
THE REFLECTIVE GARDEN THERE IS 
LOTS AND LOTS OF GREEN THIS 
FANTASTIC PLANT A WONDERINGFUL 
ARCHITECTURAL FOLIAGE AND 
WHITE SLASH GREEN FLOWERS ON THE TOP 
BEAUTIFUL UNDERNEATH WE HAVE THE 
CANOPY OF TREE TREES WHICH HAVE 
BEEN PRUNED TO GIVE A NICE SHADY 
COVER WORTHWHILE A BEAUTIFUL 
SEATING AREA UNDERNEATH 
IF YOU ARE NOT IMPRESSED WITH GREEN 
GUARD NSZ AND YOU GARDENS AND YOU 
WANT A BIT OF COLOUR THREFOR FOOT 
AND MOUTH D. TREVOR FOOT AND MOUTH 
IS THE MAN FOR YOU TREF OR TOOT IS THE MAN FOR YOU 
IN THE THE WORLD HIGH FASHION 
IT IS THE LIKE OF CAROL WHO DICTATE 
TRENDS THIS GARDEN IS DESIGNED 
WITH SNAKING PATHS 
THEY GO IN BETWEEN BEDS AND CENTRED 
BY THE CLOUD TREES OF CLIPPED 
HORNBEAM WHICH SURROUNDED BY GREEN 
PLANTS THERE IS THE ODD BIT OF 
WHITE AND MORE DRAMATICALLY STILL 
THESE FLOWERS BUT THERE ARE NO 
FLOWERS AND COLOUR IT IS ALL GREEN 
FOLIAGE FOLIAGE THIS DESIGN REALLY DOES MOVE GARDEN 
DESIGN ONWARDS BUT ALSO IT IS NOT 
JUST THE OVERALL EFFECT IT IS 
ATTENTION TO DETAIL THIS ZINC TANK 
MAY APPEAR TO BE FULL OF WATER 
LOOK CLOSELY INSIDE IT IS A STEEL 
TANK THROUGH WHICH WATER IS PUMPED 
AT A GALLON A SECOND ATTENTION TO 
DETAIL DETAIL WATER PLAYS AL KEY PART IN THE 
DESIGN OF MANY OF THE CHELSEA SHOW 
GARDENS THIS YEAR ITS USE IS MORE 
VISIBLE AND MORE INNOVATIVE THAN 
EVER BEFORE SQUIRTING AND SPURTING 
AND SPLASHING AND CRASHING 
A LOT OF REFLECTING AND A BIT OF 
DRIPPING DRIPPING THE REFLECTIVE QUALITIES SEEM TO BE 
IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY ON THIS 
GARDEN A HUGE SHEET OF WATER JUST 
BROKEN UP BY THAT LAZY S. OF WATER 
LILIES AND A LUMP OF ROCK 
IT IS GORGEOUS AND THIS IS THE 
CANCER RESEARCH GARDEN AND TEARS OF 
WATER BUT NOT FLOWING BETWEEN THE 
TWO THERE IS BUBBLY EFFECTS COMING 
UP FROM DEEP DOWN AND JUST BREAKING 
THE SURFACE OF THE WATER 
THEY ALL LIKE THIS DARK EFFECT 
THEY HAVE LARGE TANKS SURROUNDED BY 
A CURB OF BOX L. REMEMBER ROBERT 
MYERS DOING THAT LAST YEAR 
THIS IS TOM STUART SMITH'S THIS 
TIME HE HAS GONE FOR ZINC AND THE 
REFLECTIVE QUALITY BRINGS A 
BEAUTIFUL QUALITY TO THE GARDEN 
TOM SAID IT IS A FICKLE MATERIAL 
BECAUSE IT IS SILVER WHEN IT COMES 
HE PAINTS HYDROCHANCELLORIC ACID 
AND WHEN THE ACID COMES IT TURNS 
BLACK BLACK THE TROUBLE THEY GO TO PAUL COOPER 
MADE A WELCOME RETURN TO CHELSEA 
AFTER A GAP OF NINE YEARS AND AS A 
CHELSEA GOLD MEDALIST AND FORMER 
WIN OF BEST IN SHOW HE IS HARDLY 
WET BEHIND THE EARS BUT HE IS 
DETERMINED TO MAKE A SPLASH WITH 
HIS COMEBACK FROM AN OCEAN TO A 
GARDEN PAUL FOUND INSPIRATION 
FLOWED IN VENICE THINK WHEN I'M DESIGNING A GARDEN I 
HAVE TO HAVE AN IDEA BUT AN IDEA 
DOESN'T COME FROM NOWHERE IT IS 
ALL ABOUT LOOKING AND TAKING IN THE 
WORLD AROUND US AND AS A DESIGNER 
YOU STORE ALL THIS STUFF AND OFTEN 
YOU ARE NOT REALISING YOU'RE 
COLLECTING IT BUT YOU NEED THAT 
SOURCE OF MATERIAL FROM WHICH TO 
DEVELOP AN IDEA 
VENICE IS A WONDERFUL PLACE AND IT 
IS SO RICH IN VISUAL INFORMATION 
AND IT WASN'T VERY DIFFICULT TO 
SUDDENLY FIND IT BEING AN 
INSPIRATION FOR THE GARDEN AT 
CHELSEA IT IS A UNIQUE PLACE 
SOMEHOW IT MA JIX IT UP FROM 
SOMEWHERE AND CREATED THIS 
WONDERFUL ENVIRONMENT A CITY BASED 
ON HUGE WOODEN PILES DRIVEN INTO 
WHAT WAS WATERLOGGED ISLANDS AND 
THEY BUILT BRICK WORK ON TOP OF 
THAT AND THIS LOVELY WHITE 
LIMESTONE AT OUR CHELSEA GARDEN 
WE WILL BE USING THE VERY STONE 
THAT VENICE WAS MADE OF THE 
WONDERFUL THING ABOUT VENICE IS 
ABOUT EXPLORING IT AS YOU GO 
THROUGH THE SPACES YOU COME ACROSS 
GARDENS VENICE IS FULL OF HIDDEN 
SECRET GARDENS THEY ARE MAGICAL 
SPACES SPACES I'M IN A GARDEN DESIGNED BY CARLOS 
SKALPER IT IS A VERY MODERN SPACE 
I CAME HERE WHEN I WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN 
JUST WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO EMBARK ON 
BEING AN ART STUDENT AND IT JUST 
TOOK MY BREATH AWAY 
THEN I WANTED TO BE A CYCLE A 
SCULPTURE NOT A GARDEN DESIGNER 
THIS IS WHERE I FOUND THAT MY REAL 
CAREER WAS IN CREATING LANDSCAPES 
WHEN I FIRST VISITED THIS PLACE 
WAS THE USE OF WATER YOU HAVE THE 
WONDERFUL ATTENTION TO DETAIL WHERE 
THE WATER IS SHAPED AND SKULLED 
HAVING VISITED IT AGAIN TO DISCOVER 
THAT A LOT OF THE GARDENS OWE A 
DEBT TO THE SHAPES CREATED IN THIS 
GARDENING HE HADN'T REALISED HOW 
MUCH I NICKED 
THE GARDEN AT CHELSEA IS IN TWO 
LEVELS YOU HAVE THE WATER LEVEL 
WHICH IS IN A SENSE THE WATERY 
ASPECT OF VENICE BUT ABOVE THE 
WATER LINE IS THE GARDEN A BIT 
LIKE HERE WITH THE PLANTS SITTING 
ABOVE THE WATER LEVEL THAT'S WHERE 
THE GARDEN EMERGES THAT'S WHERE 
THE PLANTS ARE PRESENTED AT NOSE 
LEVEL LEVEL THE CONCEPT OF THE WHOLE GARDEN IS 
BASED ON VENICE THE STYLE OF THE 
GARDEN ACTUALLY IS BORROWED FROM 
THE WORK OF THE RENAISSANCE 
ARCHITECT HOSE WORK DOMINATES THIS 
WHOSE WORK DOMINATES THIS AREA OF 
WHICH VENICE IS A CRUCIAL PART 
THE VILLA WAS A PERFECT COMAMP 
EXAMPLE THIS EXAMPLE OF THIS 
ARCHITECT'S WORK YOU HAVE THE 
STRONG COLUMNS AND A FACADE ON BOTH 
SIDES THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING IS 
THE SAME AS THE BACK OF THE 
BUILDING WHEN YOU HAVE A COMPLEX 
IDEA IT IS NICE TO HAVE AL SIMPLE 
STYLE WHICH CAN HOLD THE COMPLEX 
ELEMENTS TOGETHER 
IT IS A CHALLENGING GARDEN TO BUILD 
BECAUSE WE ARE USING HEAVY STONE 
AND WE HAVE COMPLICATED WATER 
FEATURES WITH WATER CASCADING OVER 
THE PLACE BUT THIS IS WHAT VENICE 
IS ABOUT IT IS FULL OF SKULLYOU 
ARE TURE SCULPTURE AND FANTASTIC 
ARCHITECTURE AND HOPEFULLY THE 
GARDEN WILL BE TOO 
THERE IS NO DOUBTING FROM SOUND AND 
SIGHT THAT WATER IS THE FOUNDATION 
OF THIS GARDEN 
YEAH IT IS 
THEY HAD LOTS OF INSPIRATION IN 
TERMS OF WHERE THE IDEA EVOLVED 
FROM IT HAS TO BE A GARDEN IN ITS 
OWN RIGHT AND WATER GIVES AN 
ANIMATED ENVIRONMENT 
IT IS A GARDEN ABOUT SENSATION THE 
NOISE OF THE FOUNTAIN WATER 
RIPLING DOWN STONE SURFACES YOU 
HAVE OTHER AREAS WHERE THE WATER IS 
CALM AND COOL LOTS OF IDEAS COMING 
TOGETHER BUT THEY HAVE GOT TO MAKE 
AN EXPERIENCE NOW NOT ABOUT THE 
PAST NOT ABOUT THE INSPIRATION 
IT IS A VERY CON SEMPRY GARDEN 
CONTEMPORARY GARDEN THE WAY YOU 
INSTIL IDEAS AND COME UP WITH THE 
FINAL PLAN 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO MAKE A 
GARDEN ABOUT VENICE AND IMITATE THE 
PAST I TRY AND TAKE THE ESSENCE OF 
THE PAST AND DISTIL IT INTO A NEW 
FORM THE TIMBERS 
YEAH THE 
TIMBERS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THOSE 
THEY ARE OUTSIDE THE GARDEN WHAT 
DO THEY REPRESENT 
THEY LAY 
TRADITION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
IDEA THEY RELATE BACK TO THE 
TIMBER PALLETS ON WHICH VENICE IS 
BUILT IT GIVES A CONTRAST BETWEEN 
THE STONE AND ITS OOZING TIMBER 
THE WATER WATER SEEPS OUT OF THE 
TIMBER TIMBER IT IS SYMBOLIC THEN OR DO YOU SEE 
THIS AS A CREATION THAT YOU COULD 
LIVE WITH 
EVEN WITH THIS MARQUEE 
AT THE BACK IT DOESN'T LOOK OUT OF 
PLACE IT IS A TWENTIETH CENTURY PIECE 
OF CLASSICAL ACTECH TURE BUT IT 
COULD BE SET IN A COURTYARD CONTEXT 
WHEN YOU GET DOWN HERE TO THE FRONT 
IT IS CALMER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
THANK YOU 
SHOW GARDENS LIKE PAUL'S MAY 
CAPTURE THE HEADLINES BUT BUT IT 
IS THE GREAT PAVILION THAT TRULY 
CAPTURES THE HEART 
THIS IS WHERE IT IS ALL HANG THIS

FLOWER PAVILION HERE YOU FIND 
PLANTS THAT COME FROM ALL OVER THE 
WORLD THERE ARE MASSES THERE ARE 
THOUSANDS OF OF DIFFERENT SPECIES

PYRAMID FULL OF SO MANY GOODIES

FABULOUS ORLAYA 
THE PETALS ARE A GUIDE FOR INSECTS

ALL THE TIME PRETTY DAINTY 
DELICATE AND EASY TO GROW FROM SEED ALMOST AS FAR FROM HOME AS WE COULD 
BE THIS IS A VAST ARRAY OF 
FASCINATING PLANTS THAT TYPIFY 
SOUTH AFRICA WITH EVERY 
CONCEIVABLE COLOUR SHAPE AND FORM 
LOOK AT THESE WONDERFUL PLANTS 
THEY LOOK LIKE GRASSES BUT EACH 
ONE IS DIFFERENT DIFFERENT FORM 
DIFFERENT SORT OF TEXTURE LOOK AT 
THIS ONE IT HAS LOVELY DROOPING 
FRONDS MOST ARE FROM THE CAPE AND 
THEY GO GROW IN MARSHY GROUND 
LUPINS ARE COTTAGE GARDEN TYPE 
BUT HEN YOU SEE THEM TOGETHER LIKE 
THIS IN THESE SPLENDID BIG PATCHES 
THEY ARE DRAMATIC A NEW 
INTRODUCTION IS LUPIN THUNDER THE 
THING I LOVE ABOUT THEM IS THE HUGE 
CONDENSED SPIKES YOU CAN SEE THEM 
AROUND THE GARDEN AND THEY MAKE 
WONDERFUL FOCAL POINTS HERE THERE 
IS A LOT OF GLORIOUS PLANTS 
EVERYTHING IS INTRIGUING DAHLIAS

SOMETHING LIKE THE BIG GARDEN 
HYBRIDS LOOK AT THIS GREAT FORM 
IT GIVES MEANING AND FOLKAL POINT 
TO IS THIS IS THE CHINESE FOXGLOVE 
WITH THE LONG FLOWERS THEY ARE 
EASY TO GROW FROM SEED TOO LOOK AT 
THAT IT IS A SORT OF THISTLE IT 
LOOKS AS THOUGH SOMEBODY HAD BEEN 
AT IT WITH THE SCISSORS AND CHOPPED 
OFF THE TOP HOW ABOUT THIS THIS 
IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PLANTS IT 
LOVES TO GROW IN DAMP SHADY PLACES 
AND REGINALD FARER DESCRIBED IT AS 
THAT NOBLE FAIRY FROM HARDYS TO 
HARVEYS AND THE DOUBLE VERSION OF 
THIS FLOWER IT IS A MORE COMPACT 
PLANT AND MORE ORNATE AND IT WOULD 
WOULD LOOK BETTER IN FORMAL 
SETTING IT REQUIRES THE SAME KIND 
OF CONDITIONS SO TOO DOES THIS 
THIS IS CARAMEL YOU CAN SEE WHY IT 
IS CALLED THAT THEY ARE SOMETIMES 
CALLED JESTER'S HATS THESE ARE A 
FEW EXAMPLES OF THE HUGE NUMBER OF 
PLANTS YOU WILL FIND GATHERED

FLOWER IS THIS THE YELLOW FORM OF 
THE CROWN IMPERIAL 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL 
YOU KNOW THE STORY OF THE CROWN 
IMPERIAL IT WAS THE ONLY FLOWER 
WHICH DIDN'T BOW ITS HEAD IN 
RESPECT WHEN CHRIST DIED AN ANGEL 
CAME DOWN AND ADMONISHED IT AND 
THEN IT DID BOW ITS HEAD IF YOU 
LOOK IN EACH FLOWER THERE IS A 
TEAR DROP IN EACH FLOWER 
YOU LEARN 
SOMETHING EVERY DAY 
STICK AROUND 
WHAT IS THE ONE PROBLEM WITH 
POPPIES 
THEY DON'T LAST LONG POPPIES EXACTLY THERE ARE NOW A BREED OF 
SUPERPOPPIES SANDY WORTH DOWN IN 
YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS SHE HAS 
BEEN DEVELOPING SOME AND THEY WILL 
FLOWER FOR UP TO EIGHTEEN DAYS EACH EACH INDIVIDUAL FLOWER 
THAT IS WHAT YOU 
WANT 
THERE IS A NICE LINK WITH WANT POPPIES WE HAD HARRY PATCH HE IS 
AGED ONE HUNDRED NINE AND THE LAST SURVIVING 
SOLDIER WHO FOUGHT TPWH THE TRENCHS 
IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR HE WAS LAST 
MAN THERE AND HE IS IN THE LEEDS 
CITY COUNCIL GARDEN THAT IS A REST 
GARDEN FOR SOLDIERS 
WHAT HAS BEEN 
BANNED APART FROM GNOMES IN 
CHELSEA 
LIVE STOCK ANYTHING THAT CHELSEA FLUTTER FLAPS WALKS OR CRAWLS 
TODAY WE HAVE ANIMALS WE HAVE 
EMMA THE DONKEY 
HOW DID SHE GET 
WHY THE RELAXATION THEY ARE 
GETTING MORE AT HOME WITH HAVING 
LIVESTOCK 
YOU KNOW WHERE SHE SPENT LIVESTOCK THE NIGHT AT THE HOUSE HOLD CAVALRY 
WITH THE QUEEN'S HORSES 
THERE WAS 
A HORSE HERE THAT WE MET WE MET A 
HORSE THIS IS THE TALLEST SHETLAND 
PONY THERE IS AT FORTY TWO INCHES EACH 
YEAR HE RACES IN THE SHETLAND PO 
PONY GRAND NATIONAL AND EACH YEAR 
HE DOES NOT WIN 
YOU WERE AT THE 
WRONG END OF HIM EARLIER STKPWHRI 
WANTED SOME MANNURE BUT I DIDN'T 
GET ANY 
THERE IS MORE TO COME BUT 
IT INCLUDES THE CHELSEA PLANTS WITH AN AN TIGHT 
FOR VICTORY 
CITY SLICKERS THE URBAN GARDENS ON 
THE FAST TRACK TO SUCCESS 
AND CHELSEA BY ROYAL APPOINTMENT WELL IF HUNGER FOR SUCCESS CAN 
GUARANTEE A CHELSEA MEDAL THEN 
SOUTH WEST PLANTS HAVE THE APPETITE 
FOR GOLD ALISTAIR PIERCE HOPES TO 
SNAP VICTORY FROM THE JAWS OF HIS 
EXHIBITS THERE ARE VERY COLLECTING THESE PLANTS TWENTY SIX 
YEARS AGO 
WE GROW TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED VARIETIESMENT 
OUR MOST POPULAR ARE THE VERY THE 
VERY NICE FLYTRAP 
THEY CAN TAKE UP TO EIGHT YEARS 
FROM SEED TO MATURITY 
THE ACTUAL LEAVE PRODUCES NECTAR 
AROUND THE TOP OF THE TRAP THE FLY 
WILL LAND ON THE LEAVE AND FEED ON 
THE NECTAR AND ONCE THE FLY HAS 
TRIED IT EVEN IF IT FLIES OFF IT 
WILL ALWAYS COME BACK 
ANOTHER MAIN TYPE OF PLANT IS THE 
DROSSRA WHEN THE INSECT TOUCHES 
THE LEAVE THE TENTACLES MOVE AND 
WRAP AROUND THE INSECT AND PULL IT 
ON TO THE LEAVE 
LEAF 
THIS IS AN AUSTRALIAN ONE THEY 
MAKE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL FOR WHITE 
FLY SCOURED FLIES AND ORDINARY 
HOUSEFLIES AND HERE WE HAVE ONE 
THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY CAUGHT 
THE FLY TRAPS ARE CONSIDERED THE 
MOST ICONIC OF ALL THE PLANTS 
THE FLYTRAP CATCHES INSECTS WHICH 
REFLECTING LIGHT ON EACH SIDE OF 
THE LEAF WE HAVE THREE TRIGGER 
HEADS WHEN THE FLY TOUCHES ONE OF 
THE OF THE TRIGGER TRIGGER HEADS 
IT SENDS A SIGNAL FOR THE TRAP TO 
ACTUALLY CLOSE 
THIS IS VENICE FLYTRAP IT HAS 
LARGE LARGE TRAPS EASILY ABLE TO 
CATCH A CAS IT LIKES WASP 
DON'T USE LONDON TAP WATER IT 
WOULD HATE IT SOMETIMES FEED 
HORSE FLIES IF A HORSE FLY BITES 
ME YOU WILL PUT IT IN VENICE FLYTRAP FLYTRAP ONE OF MY MAIN MAIN INTERESTS IS IN 
THE BREEDING OF THE PLANTS GOING 
AROUND WITH A PAINT BRUSH AND 
TRANSFERRING POLLEN FROM ONE PLANT 
TO ANOTHER IT TAKES ME FOUR OR 
FIVE YEARS BEFORE I CAN DECIDE 
WHETHER PLANT IS WORTH KEEPING 
THE NICE THING ABOUT BREEDING 
PLANT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE IT 
A NAME AND TO IMMORTALISE SOMEONE 
OR SOMETHING IN ITS NAME 
THIS ONE I'VE NAMED ASBO IT IS 
ABOUT THREE FOOT ALL AND HAS A 
GREAT BIG MOUTH IT IS A REALLY 
WICKED IN YOUR FACE SORT OF PLANT 
I HAVE I HAVE ANOTHER PLANT WHICH I 
NAMED AFTER MY MOTHER IN LAW 
SHE IS ACTUALLY CHUFFED 
SHE HASN'T ACTUAL LIP SEEN THE 
PLANT SHE LIKES TO THINK OF IT AS 
ONE OF THE TALL SLENDER ONES IT'S 
FAIRLY PLUMP IT HAS RED VEINS AND 
GETS REDDER AND REDDER THE MORE 
SUN IT GETS 
WELL I WAS PLANNING ON MEETING 
ALGSTER TO TALK ALISTAIR TO TALK 
ABOUT HIS STAND BUT HE DISAPPEARED 
HE MUST OF BEEN CON CONSUMED BY THE 
PLAN EITHER THAT OR HIS MOTHER IN 
LAW GOT HOLD OF HIM AFTER NAMING 
THAT DUMPY LITTLE PLANT AFTER HER 
IT IS A WONDERFUL STAND 
TINY INSECTS BUZZING AROUND AND 
THIS ONE IS INTERESTING THESE SUN 
PLANTS I DON'T KNOW THESE THE 
TINY INSECTS STUCK TO THEIR GLUEY 
EXPERIOR EXPERIOR THESE TEND TO BE SHOWN AGAINST A 
BLACK BACKDROP THIS ONE WHEN THEY 
DO FLOWER THEY ARE STUNNING 
THIS HAS A WONDERFUL RED FLOWER 
IF HE IS NOT HERE HE WON'T MIND ME 
TOUCHING A COUPLE OF HIS PLANTS 
WILL HE THIS ONE AT THE BACK IT 
HAS A LONG NAME THAT LOVELY ACIDY 
YELLOW FRESH FOLIAGE YOU CAN GROW 
THESE OUTSIDE IN THE U. K. YOU NEED A 
BOGGY SOIL AND THEY ARE NOT GREAT 
FOR THE ORGANIC GROWER BECAUSE THEY 
LIKE PEAT L. DON'T KNOW WHERE 
ALISTAIR IS THERE IS A SKELETON IN 
THERE BUT I'M SURE THAT'S A 
CROCODILE CROCODILE ALISTAIR IF YOU'RE IN THERE YOU 
CAN COME OUT NOW SOME OF THE DESIGNS AT CHELSEA CAN 
BE FOUND IN THE SMALL GARDENS 
NOW WHAT THESE PLOTS LACK IN SIZE 
THEY MORE THAN MAKE UP IN AMBITION 
THERE ARE TWO SMALL GARDEN 
CATEGORIES COURTYARD AND URBAN 
HERE WITH THE URBAN GARDENS THE 
URBAN LAURENCE LLEWELYN LOWAN 
BOAAN 
LAURENCE LLEWELYN BOAAN 
THERE IS NO WHERE I CAN THINK THAT 
IS MORE APPOLL JETICALLY URBAN IS 
TOKYO IT IS A SURPRISE THAT THE 
TOKYO GARDEN FEELS ROMANIC THERE 
IS THE FRAMEWORK OF CONTEMPORARY 
FEELING JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE BUT 
THE PLANNING IS UNBELIEVABLY 
DELICATE DELICATE IT LOOKS MORE INSUBSTANTIAL AGAINST 
THIS ROUGH TOUGH BUTCH BLOCK WORK 
ANOTHER FRONT GARDEN THERE ONE 
TOKYO BUT THE FUTURE IT IS 
INCREDIBLY PRACTICAL AND AS YOU 
WOULD EXPECT ENVIRONMENTALLY 
TACTFUL THERE IS SOMEWHERE TO KEEP 
THE BICYCLES THERE IS THE 
RAINWATER HARVESTING SYSTEM AND 
SOMEWHERE TO PUT THE RECYCLING BIN 
BUT IT IS THAT THAT CATCHES MY EYE 
IT IS A REAL THEME WHY GROW ALONG 
THE GROUND WHEN YOU CAN PLANT UP 
THE WALL AS WELL 
HERE THE VERTICAL PLANTING CALLS TO 
MIND STRIPED WALLPAPER THIS IS A 
VERY CONTEMPORARY AND VERY CUTTING 
EDGE DESIGN BUT MAKES SPECIFIC 
REFERENCES BACK TO THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT 
AND GUESS WHAT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THE CATS 
PYJAMAS IN INTERIOR DESIGNERS WAS 
STRIPED FLOCKED WATER PAPER AND 
DISPLAYS OF FERNS LIKE THAT AND 
ATTED WINDOW BIG BIG CHINTZ 
CURTAINS THIS GARDEN SELL 
CELEBRATES THE ONE HUNDRED FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE DEATH OF THE COMPOSER AND AT 
THE HEART OF IT THIS WATER FEATURE 
CELEBRATES HIS MOST FAMOUS SAYING 
THAT HIS MUSIC WAS AKIN TO A 
TEMPEST IN A TEACUP 
AND THEN FOR THE URBAN SOPHISTICATE 
THERE IS THIS GARDEN IT IS FOR 
SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO GO TO THEIR 
LOCAL CAPPUCCINO BAR ON A SCOOTER 
SOMEONE WHO LIKES THEIR COLOUR 
SCHEMES TIGHTLY CONTROLLED 
CONTROLLED AND SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES 
THIS SEASON'S BLACK IS BLACK 
IT IS CALLED URBAN RAIN AND IT IS 
ABOUT COLLECTING RECYCLING AND 
RECIRCULATING RAIN SO ITS ITS 
GREEN CREDENTIALS ARE EXCELLENT 
THIS IS GREEN LIVING 
UNLIKE MANY OF THE OTHERS IT IS 
ABOUT CREATION OF A SUB URBAN OASIS 
A GREEN BUBBLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
CITY USING THE VERTICAL PLANTING 
TO CREATE A BARRIER AGAINST THE 
OUTSIDE WORLD 
AND THEN THERE ARE THE BUBBLING 
TUBES TO CREATE COOLING SOOTHING 
POSITIVE NOISE POLLUTION 
SOT BIG NEWS FOR FOR SO THE BIG 
NEWS IS TO LOOK LOOK TO THE 
BOUNDARIES WALLS FENCE S. TRELLISS 
ALL CAN PROVIDE POTENTIAL PLANTING 
POCKETS SO YOU CAN SQUEEZE 
HORTICULTURE INTO THE SMALLEST 
SPACE THE LOOK IS CONTEMPORARY 
WHICH IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE URBAN 
CONTEXT BUT THERE IS SOMETHING 
INTERESTING HAPPENING WITH MATERIAL 
LOOK AT 
THERE IS WOODS 
AND METALS IT IS GETTING MORE 
TEXTURAL AGAINST INTERESTING 
PLANTING AND THE PLANTING IS 
FASCINATING DESPITE THE URBAN 
CONCEPTS THERE ARE PLANTS LIKE 
FOXGLOVES WHICH GIVE IT A COTTAGY 
EDGE ONE OF THE URBAN GARDENS NOT 
FEATURED THERE WAS THE THE L. K. 
BENNETT BENNETT HE PROBABLY DIDN'T FEATURE IT FOR 
DIPLOMATIC REASONS 
AS MY KIDS WOULD SAY WHAT HAVE YOU 
ACHIEVED 
IT IS A LONDON GARDEN IT ACHIEVED TRIES TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF 
BEING OVERLOOKED WITHOUT DOING 
OBVIOUS AND BLOCKING OUT YOUR 
SURROUNDINGS IF YOU LIVE IN THE 
CITY YOU ACCEPT THAT YOU HAVE 
NEIGHBOURING BUILDINGS AND HIGH 
WINDOWS THIS SCREEN THIS SEMI 
TRANSPARENCY THAT IS INTENDED TO 
GIVE A PROTECTIVE ARM AROUND THE 
SEATING AREA SO YOU DON'T FEEL TOO 
HEMMED IN AND ENCLOSED THERE IS A 
BARRIER BETWEEN YOU AND THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD

DOMINATING THE THE PURPLES AND THE 
GREY SLATE 
WE ARE BANG ON THE MONEY 
I THINK IT IS A TWO WAY STREET 
FASHION INSPIRES GARDENING 
GARDENING INSPIRES FASHION

PLANT PERSON

ARRANGEMENT SOCIETIES THEY USE ALL 
THIS MATERIAL AND MORE THEY ARE IN

TOGETHER FLOWER ARRANGING CLUBS 
FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND EACH 
YEAR ONE REGION TAKES ITS TURN TO 
REPRESENT THEM THIS YEAR THE 
CHALLENGE HAS GONE TO KENT 
KENT IS THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND AND 
WE REALLY WANT TO SHOW WHAT KENT 
CAN DO 
MY FIRST JOB AS TEAM LEADER WAS TO 
FIND A LOCATION WHERE WE COULD 
BUILD OUR EXHIBIT AND WORK ON IT 
FOR MONTHS REALLY 
WHEN YOU THINK OF ALL THESE OTHER 
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON THE 
INDUSTRIAL INDUSTRIAL ESTATE HERE 
AND NOBODY IS AWARE WHAT BEAUTIFUL 
FLOWERS AND WHAT AN AMAZING DESIGN 
IS GOING ON 
SOMEBODY LOOKED STRANGE AT ME THIS 
MORNING ACTUALLY WHEN HAD SCISSORS 
IN ME HAND AND FLOWERS IN ME HAND 
AND THEY LOOKED AT THE INDUSTRIAL 
ESTATE AND THOUGHT I'M OUT OF 
PLACE PLACE THE IDEA FOR THE EXHIBIT STARTED 
WITH WANTING TO SHOW BEAUTIFUL 
COLOURED FLOWERS TO REPRESENT THE 
SHAPES YOU WOULD SEE IN A 
KALEIDOSCOPE WE WANT WANT PEOPLE 
TO FEEL THE MAGIC AS THEY FELT AS 
CHILD LOOKING THROUGH OUR CIRCLES 
AND SEEING BLOCKS OF COLOUR 
REPEATING AND TAKING THEM ON A A 
REALLY MAGICICAL JOURNEY 
WE ARE TRYING TO BRING IN COLOURS 
FROM ACROSS THE SPECTRUM I'M 
REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT COLOUR AND 
HENCE THESE LOVELY ROSE ARE CHERRY 
BRANDY BRANDY WITHIN THE MARQUEE IF YOU HAVE A 
SMALL DESIGN IT WOULD PROBABLY 
DISAPPEAR IT HAS GOT GOT TO BE 
REALLY BOLD WE WANTED TO CREATE 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD STOP PEOPLE IN 
THEIR TRACKS A REAL WOW FACTOR WE 
HOPE HOPE WE HAVE NEVER WORKED TOGETHER 
BEFORE HAVE WE 
WE HATE IT DON'T 
WE WE IT HAS BEEN A TEAM EFFORT 
I'M DOING THE CATERING FOR THE TEAM 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
EVERYBODY IS FED AND NOT HUNGRY OR 
I DON'T WANT THEM TO FLAKE OUT 
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SUR SUR MOURCHTED 
A A FEW CHALLENGES 
THERE ARE A FEW TO GO THE BIGGEST 
CHALLENGE IS GETTING THE FLOWERS TO 
THE TOP RING I'M NOT PLANNING ON 
GOING UP I THINK WE'RE SENDING 
HELEN UP THERE BECAUSE SHE IS THE 
SMALLEST AND SHE IS MARRIED TO A 
BUILDER AND PROBABLY KNOWS MORE 
ABOUT CLIMBING 
HEIGHT DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME AS 
LONG AS IT FEELS STABLE AND IT IS 
NOT WOBBLY IT IS FINE WHAT COULD 
COULD GO WRONG ANYTHING 
I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING AS LARGE 
AS AN EXHIBIT LIKE THIS AND NOR 
HAVE MY TEAM BUT IT IS GREAT 
PLIF PRIVILEGE AND WE ARE REALLY 
REALLY KEEN TO GET A GOLD MEDAL 
I'M NERVOUS AND EXCITED ALL THE 
MOTIONS ALTOGETHER 
IT IS AN AMAZING FEELING DESIGNING 
FOR CHELSEA 
IT IS THE VERY TOP YOU CAN GET AS A 
FLOWER ARRANGER

BIRD'S EYE VIEW 
YOU GET THE VIEW 
WE DON'T GET EXCEPT WITH OUR BIG 
JIB ARM 
YES IT IS A LOVELY VIEW 
BUT IT IS SCARY ONCE YOU GOT USED 
TO EVERYTHING MOVING AND FEELING 
SEA SICK IT WAS FINE 
PEOPLE DON'T 
REALISE THE QUANTITY OF MATERIAL 
THAT GOES INTO THESE YOU CAN'T DO 
THE ENTIRE THING BEFOREHAND 
BECAUSE IT COSTS TOO MUCH 
YES WE

BUT IT COULD COST TOO MUCH TO DO IT 
TWICE
