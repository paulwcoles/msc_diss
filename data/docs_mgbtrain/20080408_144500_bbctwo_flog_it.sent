WE'RE IN LEICESTER FOR TODAY'S SHOW WELCOME TO FLOG IT 
THERE'S BEEN A SETTLEMENT HERE SINCE THE IRON AGE AND THE ROMANS 
AND THE VIKINGS HAVE ALSO LEFT THEIR MARK 
MORE RECENTLY LEICESTER HAS BECOME FAMOUS AS THE HOME 
OF HEART THROB CROONER ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK 
PLEASE RELEASE ME 
THE CITY WHERE NINETEEN SEVENTIES POP GROUP SHOWADDYWADDY WERE FORMED 
BAB B. A. B. A. B. A. B. A. 
AND THE HOME OF FORMER MEMBER OF THE MONTY PYTHON TEAM GRAHAM CHAPMAN 
AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
OUR TWO EXPERTS CHARLIE ROSS AND ADAM PARTRIDGE 
LOOK AT THAT 
EVERYBODY IS NOW SEATED COMFORTABLY INSIDE THE MAIN HALL 
WHO WILL BE THE LUCKY ONES CHOSEN TO GO OFF TO AUCTION 
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE ADAM HAS JUST SPOTTED SOMETHING 
HI JANET HOW ARE YOU I'M FINE 
WELCOME TO FLOG IT THANK YOU 
I GET EXCITED ABOUT AUTOGRAPH ALBUMS BECAUSE YOU NEVER 
KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO APPEAR IN THEM NO YOU DON'T 
THIS ONE HAS SOMETHING I AM VERY INTERESTED IN WHICH IS CRICKETING AUTOGRAPHS THAT'S CORRECT 
WHO IS J. PRESTON HE IS 
OR WAS THE NEPHEW OF MY FATHER WHO PLAYED CRICKET FOR LEICESTERSHIRE 
IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND THIRTIES 
SO YOUR FATHER GOT THIS BOOK FOR TOM PRESTON AND MANAGED TO FILL IT 
WITH LOTS OF AUTOGRAPHS OF FAMOUS CRICKETERS 
YES ALL IN ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR 
NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE SO WE'LL LOOK THROUGH 
SURREY NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE LOOK AT THAT PERCY FENDER 
AND JACK HOBBS TWO OF THE MOST FAMOUS CRICKETERS OF ALL TIME 
AND THAT'S GLOUCESTERSHIRE WALLY HAMMOND 
ANOTHER BIG NAME 
I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHERS 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A FEW FAMOUS YORKSHIREMEN THERE I'M SURE HERBERT SUTCLIFFE 
ABSOLUTELY VERY GOOD 
CAN I TELL YOU MY FATHER BOWLED HIM OUT FOR A DUCK 
DID HE THAT'S SOME ACCOLADE 
A CAREER DEFINING MOMENT PERHAPS BECAUSE SUTCLIFFE WAS ONE OF THE BEST BATSMAN EVER 
ABSOLUTELY HERE'S LEICESTERSHIRE AND THAT'S MY FATHER 
THAT'S YOUR FATHER'S AUTOGRAPH IS IT 
THAT'S GREAT ISN'T IT 
SUPER ALBUM 
THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST TO CRICKET COLLECTORS THERE 
I THINK IT WILL PROBABLY MAKE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FOR A COLLECTION 
THAT COULD BE GOOD YES 
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T LIKE TO SEE IT GO FOR LESS THAN NINETY 
SO ARE YOU GOING TO PUT A RESERVE ON IT FOR ME 
YOU DON'T WANT IT GOING FOR NOTHING DO YOU 
OH NO I CAN HAND IT ON CAN'T I 
ABSOLUTELY I CAN PASS IT ON IF IT GOES HERE 
AND LET'S HOPE WE BOWL THEM OVER WITH YOUR CRICKET AUTOGRAPHS 
ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING 
WELL KEITH NO PRIZES FOR TELLING ME WHAT THIS IS 
BESWICK CORRECT 
TELL ME HOW DID YOU COME BY IT 
THE FAMILY PURCHASED IT IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND IT WAS PASSED DOWN TO US 
AND IT HAS REMAINED AS IT IS EVER SINCE NOT BROKEN OR ANYTHING 
IT HELPS THAT IT'S ON A PLINTH BASE 
THE HORSES THAT FREE STAND ON THEIR LEGS ARE MUCH MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE THAN ANYTHING ON A BASE 
IF WE WERE TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN YOU WOULD SEE AN IMPRESSED BESWICK MARK ONE HAVE NO DOUBT AT ALL 
WELL IT'S VERY FAINT 
YES BUT IT WOULD BE THERE 
AND OF COURSE 
IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE POPULAR 
IF YOU'D BROUGHT THIS ALONG TEN YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AT ALL INTERESTED 
THE REASON IT'S BECOME MORE COLLECTIBLE IS THE BESWICK FACTORY IS NO LONGER 
IT CLOSED ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
SO THERE WON'T BE ANY MORE MADE 
IT'S ARGUABLE THAT BESWICK HAS REACHED A BIT OF A PEAK 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOING TO CARRY ON GOING UP 
WE MIGHT IN HINDSIGHT THINK THIS WAS THE RIGHT TIME TO SELL 
YES WITH SOME THINGS YOU THINK SHOULD I KEEP IT SHOULD I NOT 
I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF YOU DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE IT 
I DID LIKE IT BUT YOU DON'T ANY MORE 
WELL I DO LIKE IT STILL BUT IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF IT LET SOMEBODY ELSE ENJOY IT 
YEAH YEAH 
I'M AFRAID OF IT GETTING BROKEN ANYWAY RIGHT RIGHT 
HAVE YOU FORMED AN IDEA OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH I SHOULD IMAGINE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THAT'S A PRETTY EXACT VALUE ISN'T IT HAVE YOU DONE YOUR HOMEWORK 
I'VE BEEN READING UP ON SOME OF IT 
IT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO MAKE ONE HUNDRED 
YES I WOULD EXPECT IT TO MAKE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
RIGHT WE'LL PUT THAT AS A SALEROOM ESTIMATE ON IT 
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF INTEREST IN IT I'M SURE 
DO YOU WANT TO PUT A RESERVE ON IT 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED 
SHALL WE USE A BIT OF DISCRETION IF THE AUCTIONEER GETS CLOSE 
YES O. K. THAT'S FINE WITH ME 
ONE HUNDRED I THINK THAT'S PRETTY SAFE 
FRANKLY IF IT DOES NOT SELL FOR THAT 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE IT BACK AND RISK BREAKING IT AGAIN 
JULIA WHAT A MARVELLOUS OIL PAINTING LET'S GO DEEP INTO THE OAK FOREST SHALL WE 
YOU WANT TO TRAVEL INTO THAT PICTURE LOOK WHERE THE PERSPECTIVE TAKES YOU 
ALTHOUGH I'VE GOT A CHOICE MY SIDE 
BECAUSE I CAN SEE YOU CAN GO RIGHT THROUGH THERE TO THAT PATH OR THAT PATH ON THAT ANGLE THAT'S RIGHT 
SO HOW DID YOU COME ACROSS THIS 
IT'S BEEN IN MY FAMILY SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY 
MY FATHER ACQUIRED IT 
APPARENTLY HE DID SOME WORK FOR AN ELDERLY LADY 
HE WOULDN'T ACCEPT ANY PAYMENT SO SHE GAVE HIM A CHOICE OF PAINTINGS 
THERE WAS A LOT OF PAINTINGS AND SHE SAID PICK WHICH ONE YOU LIKE 
IT WASN'T FRAMED AT THE TIME 
AND THAT'S THE ONE HE CHOSE AND THAT'S ITS HISTORY 
YOU'VE SEEN THIS AS A GIRL YOU'VE GROWN UP LOOKING AT THIS 
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ON MY FAMILY WALL ALWAYS ON THE LOUNGE FOR FORTY YEARS 
YOU HAD A RATHER LARGE LOUNGE 
YOU MUST HAVE DONE WE DID THEN 
THIS IS A VERY LARGE FURNISHING PICTURE 
QUITE DIFFICULT TO SELL PURELY BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE 
IT NEEDS TO GO INTO BIG HOMES SO YOU'VE GOT IT ON THE WALL AT HOME 
I HAVEN'T NOW 
MY MOTHER HAD IT ON THE WALL BUT 
SINCE IT'S COME TO MY HOUSE I HAVEN'T HAD A WALL BIG ENOUGH OR A ROOM LARGE ENOUGH TO DISPLAY IT 
IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN BEHIND A LARGE CHEST OF DRAWERS JUST COLLECTING DUST 
I'VE KEPT MEANING TO SELL IT 
RIGHT THE FIRST THING THAT I NOTICED WAS WHEN I FELT IT 
IT'S QUITE STRETCHY IT IS 
DO YOU KNOW WHY IT'S STRETCHY 
BECAUSE AS A CANVAS IT'S BEEN RELINED 
THERE'S A CANVAS ON THE BACK SUPPORTING THE CANVAS ON THE FRONT 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BACK YOU CAN FEEL THE CANVAS IS LOOSE 
IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT NEEDS RE STRETCHING IT'S BECAUSE IT'S BEEN RE LINED 
THAT'S A CANVAS ON THE BACK OF THE ORIGINAL CANVAS 
AND LOOK AT THE WEAVE HERE THAT'S TYPICAL NINETEEN SIXTIES SEVENTIES CANVAS 
THE VICTORIAN WEAVE IS MUCH ROUGHER 
SO THIS HAS BEEN RELINED IN THE SIXTIES OR SEVENTIES 
THAT'S SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW AND THE FRAME 
ISN'T CONTEMPORARY TO THE PICTURE BECAUSE RIGHT DOWN HERE IN THIS CORNER 
THERE'S A LITTLE SIGNATURE WALTER C. BLUCHER 
AND IT'S DATED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT 
SO IT'S A LATE VICTORIAN PAINTING WHICH 
IS RIGHT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S IN THAT 
SLIGHTLY IMPRESSIONISTIC STYLE WHICH WAS VERY VERY POPULAR THEN 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT IS IT'S ALMOST LATE AUTUMN 
IT'S GOT THAT AUTUMNAL LOOK 
ALL THOSE SORT OF BRONZERS COPPERS IT'S LOOSE IT'S BUILT UP 
IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT GOT THE RIGHT FRAME IT'S BEEN RELINED 
AND I LOOKED THE ARTIST UP IN THE ART SALES INDEX GUIDE 
I TRIED LOOKING ON THE INTERNET AND THERE IS NO REFERENCE TO HIM WHICH MEANS I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING 
NO WHICH MEANS HE WAS A VERY GOOD AMATEUR PAINTER 
HE'S NOT HAD ANY OF HIS WORK PUT INTO A BIG EXHIBITION LIKE 
THE ROYAL ACADEMY WHICH WOULD GIVE HIS WORK CREDENCE VALUE AND PROVENANCE 
IF I SAID TO YOU I THINK WE SHOULD PUT THIS INTO AUCTION 
WITH A VALUE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH THAT 
ERM I WAS HOPING FOR THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED BUT IF THAT'S WHAT IT'S WORTH 
I STILL NEED TO SELL IT BECAUSE IT'S SITTING BEHIND A CHEST OF DRAWERS 
YOU SAID YOU WERE HOPING FOR THE THREE TO FIVE IT'S GOING TO GET THE THREE I'M PRETTY SURE OF THAT 
THREE'S MY MID ESTIMATE 
IF IT'S AT THE HIGHER END OF MY VALUATION THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED 
WE'VE NEARLY GOT WHAT YOU WANT FOR IT LOVELY 
I'D LIKE TO PUT THE MONEY TOWARDS A HOLIDAY SO I'LL PART WITH IT 
O. K. LET'S FLOG IT SHALL WE LET'S FLOG IT 
CHRISTINE WELCOME TO FLOG IT HELLO 
YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG A REALLY NICE THING AND I SAW YOU OUTSIDE IN THE QUEUE 
AND YOU SAID TO ME I'VE GOT A NEWLYN TEA CADDY 
AND I SAID QUICK LET ME HAVE IT BEFORE PAUL GETS HIS HANDS ON IT 
BECAUSE PAUL IS MAD ABOUT NEWLYN BEING A CORNISH BOY THE CORNISH COPPER 
HE'S VERY KEEN ON NEWLYN WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT YOURSELF 
ALL I KNOW IS MY GRANDMA HAD IT ON THE MANTELPIECE 
SHE JUST KEPT HER COTTONS IN IT AND THAT'S ALL I'VE DONE WITH MINE 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE GOT IT FROM SOMETHING IN YOUR GRANDMA'S HOUSE 
IT'S PRETTY COLLECTIBLE NOW NEWLYN COPPER 
WHAT WE HAVE GOT IS STAMPED ON THE BASE THERE NEWLYN 
SO WE CAN DATE IT TO AFTER NINETEEN SEVENTEEN BECAUSE USUALLY THE PREVIOUS WORKS TO THAT WERE NOT STAMPED NEWLYN 
AND THERE ARE SOME FAMOUS NAMES ASSOCIATED WITH NEWLYN 
THE ONE THAT MOST PEOPLE KNOW IS A FELLOW CALLED JOHN PEARSON WHO WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR DESIGNERS 
IT'S ALL HAND BEATEN COPPER AND THE LID TEA THERE SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN IT 
AND TYPICAL CORNISH INSPIRED WORK WITH THE FISHES AND THE BUBBLES GOING ROUND 
AND IT'S ALL HAND BEATEN REPOUSSE WORK IT'S CALLED RAISED WORK 
AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT USED TO WORK ON IT WERE QUITE ROUGH TYPES 
FISHERMEN AND ALL THAT THAT USED TO DO THE WORK ON THESE AS WELL SO IT'S PRETTY SKILFUL WORK VERY NICE 
ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S WORTH 
NO NONE AT ALL 
HAVE A GUESS FIFTY 
MORE MORE ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY I SHOULD THINK 
I DIDN'T THINK IT'D BE WORTH THAT MUCH YES GOOD 
I THINK WE'LL PUT AN ESTIMATE OF ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND I THINK IT SHOULD DO ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET YOUR HOPES UP 
NO NO WE'LL PUT A RESERVE ON IT SHALL WE 
IF WE CAN PUT ONE HUNDRED I THINK 
BUT NOT MUCH MORE O. K. THEN IS THAT ALL RIGHT 
THAT'S FINE 
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING PEACE OF NEWLYN COPPER AND NOT SEEING PAUL WITH IT 
THANKS A LOT THANK YOU 
WELL WE'VE GOT A JAM PACKED BALLROOM FULL OF FLOG IT HOPEFULS 
HOPING THEY'RE THE LUCKY ONES TO GET TAKEN OFF TO THE AUCTION ROOM

KEITH'S PRETTY BESWICK GROUP A MARE WITH HER FOAL

JULIA'S BEAUTIFUL WOODLAND SCENE HAS SPENT THE LAST FEW YEARS BEHIND 
A CHEST OF DRAWERS BUT IT DESERVES PRIDE OF PLACE ON SOMEONE'S WALL

AND YOU KNOW WHY AS WELL BECAUSE THEY CAN BE SEPARATED AND SOLD OFF SEPARATELY 
OR INDIVIDUALLY FRAMED FOR THE COLLECTOR

YES HAMMER'S GONE DOWN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY CHRISTINE OH THANK YOU PAUL 
THAT'S FANTASTIC 
A GREAT RESULT ISN'T IT 
A GREAT RESULT THAT WAS A SPECIAL BLEND THAT LITTLE CADDY 
GOOD OLD CORNWALL 
ASK ANYONE WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT KING RICHARD THE THIRD AND THEY'LL PROBABLY ANSWER THAT HE WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THE TWO PRINCES IN THE TOWER OF LONDON 
THAT HE WAS A HUNCHBACK AND IN ONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS WAS DEPICTED AS ONE OF THE MOST EVIL RULERS 
OF ALL TIME A POISONOUS BUNCH BACKED TOAD THE QUESTION IS HOW TRUE IS THAT PICTURE 
NOW WHAT'S NOT IN QUESTION IS THAT RICHARD ASCENDED TO THE THRONE IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE 
AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER EDWARD THE FOURTH 
EDWARD'S SON AND HEIR WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH 
SO UNCLE RICHARD DISOWNED THE LITTLE BOY AND CLAIMED THE THRONE TO HIMSELF 
WHAT IS ALSO TRUE IS THAT TOWARDS THE END OF ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE 
YOUNG EDWARD AND HIS LITTLE BROTHER RICHARD DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE 
THE SECOND HALF OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY WAS RIVEN BY WARFARE 
WHEN THE NOBLE HOUSES OF YORK AND LANCASTER 
WERE ENGAGED IN A CONSTANT STRUGGLE FOR POLITICAL DOMINANCE 
THESE BATTLES HAVE COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE WARS OF THE ROSES 
RICHARD THE THIRD WAS THE LAST MONARCH OF THE HOUSE OF YORK 
AND CONTROVERSY OVER HIS LEGACY HAS RAGED EVER SINCE 
FOR CENTURIES THE OFFICIAL VIEW OF HIM IS OF A WICKED DEFORMED TYRANT 
WHOSE MALICIOUS INTENT TOWARDS HIS NEPHEWS SAW HIM GAIN THE THRONE OF ENGLAND BY FOUL MEANS 
BUT HIS REIGN DIDN'T LAST FOR LONG 
A FEW YEARS LATER IN AUGUST ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE HENRY TUDOR MARCHED ON ENGLAND 
AND HENRY WHO WAS DISTANTLY AND ILLEGITIMATELY RELATED 
TO THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER THROUGH HIS MOTHER 
SOUGHT TO CHALLENGE RICHARD FOR THE THRONE 
THE NEXT DAY THE ARMIES MET NOT FAR FROM LEICESTER 
IN FACT RIGHT HERE AT BOSWORTH 
WHERE I'VE COME TO MEET WENDY MOORHEN THE RESEARCH OFFICER FOR THE RICHARD THE THIRD SOCIETY 
HI THANKS FOR TALKING TO US TODAY 
SO WHERE DID THE IDEA OF THE EVIL KING COME FROM WAS HE EVIL 
WELL THE VICTORS WRITE THE HISTORY AND WE HAD THE BIRTH OF WHAT WE CALL THE TUDOR MYTH 
HENRY TUDOR HAD A VERY TENUOUS CLAIM TO THE THRONE 
SO HE TOOK THE CROWN THROUGH CONQUEST 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WHERE DID THESE CHRONICLES COME FROM 
THE FIRST TWO WERE HIS OWN COURT HISTORIANS AND THEN TAKEN UP BY OTHER TUDOR CHRONICLES 
IT WAS THEIR WRITINGS WHICH BECAME THE SOURCES FOR WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 
BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETIES 
IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
THAT BRINGS ME ON TO MY NEXT QUESTION REALLY THE HUNCHBACK 
DO YOU BELIEVE IN THAT NO THERE'S NO CONTEMPORARY EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER 
WHAT WE DO HAVE IS AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY A SILESIAN KNIGHT 
WHO VISITED RICHARD'S COURT AND HE DESCRIBES RICHARD AND HE COMPARES HIM TO HIMSELF 
THERE IS NO HINT OF DEFORMITY BUT HE ENDS BY SAYING RICHARD HAD A GREAT HEART 
IS THERE ANY SURVIVING ARTWORK ANY PICTURES OF HIM 
NOTHING CONTEMPORARY 
THE EARLIEST PORTRAITS WE HAVE OF RICHARD WERE PAINTED IN THE SECOND DECADE OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDREDS 
ONE OF THOSE PAINTINGS IS OWNED BY THE QUEEN 
IT WAS EXAMINED ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO 
AND IT WAS FOUND THAT ONE OF THE SHOULDERS HAD BEEN REPAINTED 
RAISING THE LEVEL OF THE SHOULDER 
THIS BECAME THE TEMPLATE FOR OTHER COPIES LATER ON WHY THOUGH 
WHY WERE PEOPLE SO VITRIOLIC WHY DIDN'T THEY LIKE HIM 
THE POINT IS THAT IF YOU WERE DEFORMED IF YOU WERE UGLY 
IN THOSE DAYS THEY BELIEVED IT WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF AN INNER WICKEDNESS 
WHAT ABOUT THE MURDER OF HIS NEPHEWS DO YOU BELIEVE IN THAT 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PRINCES 
RICHARD DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A MOTIVE TO KILL THEM BUT HENRY TUDOR WOULD HAVE DONE 
IF THEY WERE STILL ALIVE AFTER THE BATTLE OF BOSWORTH THEY'D HAVE BEEN AN EMBARRASSMENT TO HIM 
HE WAS GOING TO MARRY THEIR SISTER 
IF HE'D THEN MADE HER LEGITIMATE THE BOYS WOULD THEN AUTOMATICALLY BE LEGITIMATE 
AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY AH WHY DON'T WE HAVE THEM AS KING 
WHAT SORT OF KING WAS RICHARD I BELIEVE HE WAS A FAIR AND A JUST MAN 
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT ADMINISTRATOR HE DID WELL IN THE NORTH RULING IT ON BEHALF OF HIS BROTHER 
AND DURING HIS TIME IN THE NORTH HE WAS INVOLVED IN BORDER WARFARE WITH THE SCOTS 
I THINK HE WAS HANDS ON AND HE LED FROM THE FRONT 
YES THIS IS WHERE THE BATTLE TOOK PLACE THIS IS BOSWORTH I TAKE IT 
THIS IS AMBIEN HILL 
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN THE SITE OF THE BATTLE WE DON'T KNOW 
WE ACTUALLY HAVE THREE POSSIBILITIES 
IT'S ONE OF THE WORST DOCUMENTED BATTLES IN ENGLISH HISTORY 
WE BELIEVE THAT RICHARD SAW HENRY TUDOR WITH QUITE A SMALL ENTOURAGE TO THE EDGE OF THE BATTLE 
HE TOOK THE DECISION TO ELIMINATE HIM 
IF HE KILLS HIS RIVAL THE DAY WILL BE HIS 
SO HE GATHERS HIS HOUSEHOLD ABOUT HIM 
PROBABLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED KNIGHTS AND HE CHARGES 
AND IT'S AT THIS POINT THAT HE'S BETRAYED BY A MAN CALLED SIR WILLIAM STANLEY 
WHO WAS ONE OF RICHARD'S KNIGHTS OF THE BODY 
HE ATTACKED RICHARD HE WAS CUT DOWN BUTCHERED SO WE LOST THE LAST PLANTAGENET KING OF ENGLAND 
HE WAS THE LAST KING OF ENGLAND TO DIE ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE 
THE TRIUMPHANT ARMY MARCHED TO LEICESTER 
WITH THE BODY OF THE LATE KING STRIPPED AND IGNOMINIOUSLY FLUNG ACROSS A HORSE 
HIS BLOODIED CORPSE WAS PUT ON PUBLIC DISPLAY FOR TWO DAYS 
BEFORE BEING BURIED IN A NEARBY MONASTERY 
BUT THE REMAINS WERE LOST DURING THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES AFTER THE REFORMATION 
RICHARD IS THE ONLY ENGLISH MONARCH WITHOUT A TOMB 
THE OLD SAYING GOES TO THE VICTOR THE SPOILS 
AND THAT APPLIES AS MUCH TO THE WRITING OF HISTORY AS IT DOES TO ANY BOOTY 
RICHARD'S REPUTATION IN THE YEARS TO FOLLOW WAS TREATED AS CONTEMPTUOUSLY AS HIS PERSON 
TUDOR NOW PROCLAIMED KING HENRY THE SEVENTH 
LATER MERGED THE RED ROSE OF LANCASTER AND THE WHITE ROSE OF YORK INTO THE TUDOR ROSE 
FORMING ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL DYNASTIES IN ENGLAND 
AND THE REST AS THEY SAY IS HISTORY 
IT'S NO GOOD PEOPLE TELLING ME ON FLOG IT THAT WE HAVE TOO MUCH CLARICE CLIFF BECAUSE FRANKLY 
IF YOU GET A PIECE AS GOOD AS THIS AND AS UNUSUAL AS THIS 
YOU CAN HAVE AS MUCH CLARICE CLIFF AS YOU LIKE 
ANYWAY IT'S MATTHEW AND THERESA ISN'T IT IT IS 
IT BELONGS TO YOU JOINTLY NO IT BELONGS TO IS THIS GOING TO BE AN ARGUMENT 
NO IT BELONGS TO MATTHEW'S MOTHER TELL ME ABOUT HOW IT GOT HERE 
IT GOT HERE BECAUSE MY MUM SAW ONE OF YOUR SHOWS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
REALLY YES SO SHE SENT YOU OVER HERE WITH IT WE WERE HERE ALREADY 
JUST SENT THE ITEM YES 
IT WAS ON THE TOP SHELF ABOVE THE T. V. 
AND SOMEBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT CLARICE CLIFF AND IT HAD BEEN SOLD FOR FIVE HUNDRED 
MY PARENTS WERE LIKE WOW NOBODY LIKED IT IN THE FAMILY 
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT SOME WOULD SAY IT'S AN ACQUIRED TASTE DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CLARICE CLIFF 
NO NOTHING AT ALL 
BORN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE WHICH MAKES HER VICTORIAN REALLY BY BIRTH 
BUT ANYTHING LESS VICTORIAN YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE REALLY 
SHE FORMED A TREND SHE WORKED FOR WILKINSON'S AT THE NEWPORT FACTORY WHEN SHE WAS A TEENAGER 
THEN HER DESIGNS BECAME BOLDER AND BOLDER AND HER COLOURS GOT BOLDER AND BOLDER 
SHE JUST BECAME A LEGEND REALLY 
NOW THIS SORT OF STYLE THAT SHE PRODUCED 
HAS BECOME HUGELY COMMERCIAL 
THIS HAS A PARTICULAR NAME THIS PATTERN 
WHICH IS CALLED THE TULIP PATTERN 
IT'S GOT TULIPS AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS 
THE VIBRANT ORANGE IS A TYPICAL CLARICE CLIFF COLOUR 
SO WHAT IS IT USED FOR 
IT'S AN ORNAMENTAL VASE TO GO ON THE TABLE AND TO PUT FLOWERS IN 
YOU'D HAVE TO PUT SOME SORT OF BASE IN TO PUT THE FLOWERS IN 
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A SHOPPING BASKET 
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN COMING OVER HERE BUT IT HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT OF DAMAGE 
HAVE YOU SPOTTED THAT YES IT IS IMPORTANT 
ANYBODY COLLECTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
WILL HAVE TO TEMPER THEIR VIEWS BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE 
YOU CAN'T STAND IT BUT SHE SAW SOMETHING MAKE FIVE HUNDRED 
DOES SHE THINK THIS MIGHT BE WORTH FIVE HUNDRED 
YEAH I THINK IT WAS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED SHE WAS HOPING 
I THINK FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED WOULD BE A SENSIBLE SALEROOM ESTIMATE WITHOUT THE DAMAGE 
THE DAMAGE ISN'T VAST BUT I THINK I'M GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT SAFE IF I MAY 
SALEROOM ESTIMATE THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED YEAH 
YES SHE'LL BE HAPPY WITH THAT SHE'LL PROBABLY BE OVER THE MOON 
YOU'LL BE OVER THE MOON YOU CAN'T STAND IT I'D LOVE TO GET RID OF IT 
WELL WE'LL DO THAT FOR YOU 
WE'LL ASK THE AUCTIONEERS TO PUT A RESERVE ON IT OF THREE HUNDRED 
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING IT ALONG 
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MONEY YOU SEND IT OFF TO MUM DO YOU 
YES PLUS A SMALL HANDLING CHARGE NO DOUBT ABSOLUTELY 
HI PETER HELLO ADAM WELCOME TO FLOG IT 
THANK YOU YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG SOME POLICE RELATED ITEMS YES WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT 
IT'S COME FROM MY FAMILY SIDE MY GRANDFATHER'S 
SO YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS A BERKSHIRE SPECIAL CONSTABLE 
YES RIGHT AND THAT'S HOW THEY'VE COME 
THAT'S WHERE THEY CAME FROM SO THESE WERE PASSED TO YOU 
AND WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WITH THEM ALL THESE YEARS 
HAD YOU HAD THEM ON DISPLAY NO MY FATHER'S HAD THEM 
AND WHEN HE DIED I WAS SORTING HIS THINGS OUT AND THEY TURNED UP THEN 
O. K. SO YOU'VE GOT A TRUNCHEON A PAINTED TRUNCHEON 
YOU'VE GOT THE SPECIAL CONSTABLE ARMBAND HERE 
AND YOU'VE GOT THE OLD METROPOLITAN CONSTABULARY WHISTLE 
BY HUDSON AND CO WHICH WHERE THE MAJOR MANUFACTURERS OF WHISTLES 
IT'S AN INTERESTING COLLECTION AND THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT WAS WHAT A SHAME THERE ARE NO HANDCUFFS 
I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY HANDCUFFS NO THAT'S A SHAME 
IT'S NOT A LOT OF VALUE I RECKON IT WILL MAKE ABOUT FORTY QUID THE LOT IS THAT ALL RIGHT THAT'S FINE 
IT'S BETTER THAN LEAVING IT IN THE CUPBOARD ROTTING AWAY 
O. K. SO SHALL WE PUT AN ESTIMATE OF THIRTY TO FIFTY YES THAT'S FINE 
AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE'LL MAKE A BIT MORE OF IT 
WOULD YOU LIKE A RESERVE ON IT NO NO LET IT GO LET IT GO THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME 
NO JUST LET IT GO O. K. SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO SELL IT LET'S HOPE IT MAKES THIRTY FIFTY OR MORE 
THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF RISK IN THAT BUT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE A FORTUNE NO 
SO LET'S HOPE WE DO REALLY WELL AT THE AUCTION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU THERE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHEERS 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE OF THESE JENNY 
AND I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN WHETHER ANYBODY HAS 
I'LL TELL YOU WHY IN A MINUTE BUT YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT FIRST 
WELL AN OLD LADY GAVE IT TO ME ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO 
AND I'VE KEPT IT SINCE 
BUT I'M NOT THAT KEEN YOU DON'T LIKE IT 
NO NOT REALLY NO I'M NOT MAD KEEN ON IT MYSELF 
SHE DIED LAST YEAR SO I'D LIKE TO SELL IT AND BUY SOMETHING TO REMEMBER HER BY RIGHT 
DID SHE TELL YOU IT MIGHT BE VALUABLE SHE DID 
YEAH YEAH WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU 
SHE JUST BASICALLY SAID TO INSURE IT FOR ABOUT ONE THOUSAND 
ONE THOUSAND YEAH SO YOU DID 
I DID NO I DIDN'T WHAT COS I COULDN'T AFFORD TO 
YOU COULDN'T AFFORD TO INSURE IT NO THANK GOODNESS YOU DIDN'T DROP IT 
SO IT'S BEEN ON MY DRESSING TABLE WRAPPED UP IN BUBBLE YEAH SINCE THEN 
AND FLOG IT CAME ALONG AND YOU THOUGHT HERE'S MY OPPORTUNITY 
THAT'S RIGHT YES 
I HAVE SOLD COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF DOULTON FIGURES CHARACTER JUGS OVER THE YEARS 
I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN THIS MODEL 
EVER 
SO I HAVE TO SAY I SNEAKILY WENT OUTSIDE 
TO SEE WHAT H. N. NUMBER IT SHOULD HAVE AN H. N. NUMBER 
AND THE H. N. NUMBER I THINK IS FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO 
BUT HERE COMES THE CRUNCH THERE ARE TWO VARIATIONS OF THIS FIGURE 
ONE WITH THE GREY DRESS WHICH IS WELL DOCUMENTED 
AND STILL WORTH QUITE A LOT OF MONEY 
AND ONE WITH A LILAC DRESS O. K. 
AND D'YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAYS IN THE DOULTON BIBLE 
NONE KNOWN TO EXIST THERE YOU GO 
NOW HOW GOOD IS YOUR EYESIGHT NOT VERY GOOD IN THIS LIGHT 
IS THAT GREY OR IS THAT LILAC 
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY LILAC AREN'T YOU OF COURSE I AM 
WELL I THINK THERE'S A HINT OF LILAC IT'S NOT WHAT I'D CALL GREY 
BEFORE WE LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF IT I'M SLIGHTLY CONCERNED LOOKING AT THE TOP HERE 
NOW I THINK THIS IS A FIRING MARK 
WHEN IT WAS GLAZED SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HERE AND THE GLAZING HAS RUN A BIT 
NOW IT MIGHT DETRACT FROM IT A BIT BUT IT'S NOT DAMAGED 
AS LONG AS IT'S THE WAY IT CAME FROM THE FACTORY THAT'S FINE 
AND SURE ENOUGH WHEN WE TURN IT UP HERE 
UPON HER CHEEKS SHE WEPT 
AND THE MORE VALUABLE DOULTON FIGURES ARE HAND INSCRIBED 
THIS IS HANDWRITTEN ROUND THE BOTTOM HERE 
AND MODELLED BY A CHAP CALLED NOKE 
AND IT'S DESIGNED BY A GUY CALLED PERUGINI 
NOW HE DESIGNED BOTH OF THEM 
AND THE TWO FIGURES ARE TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES IDENTICAL 
BUT THE MORE I LOOK AT THAT THE MORE I SEE LILAC SO AM I 
AND THE MORE I'M LIKING IT 
VALUE WELL YOU WERE TOLD TO INSURE IT FOR ONE THOUSAND 
NOW I ACTUALLY HAPPEN TO THINK 
THAT SHE HAS UNDERVALUED THIS FOR INSURANCE PURPOSES O. K. 
AND I THINK THIS FIGURE IS WORTH BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND TO SELL 
O. K. 
GOOD NEWS ISN'T IT 
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE SELLING THIS FOR LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND 
IF IT DOESN'T MAKE ONE THOUSAND MY ADVICE IS DON'T SELL IT O. K. 
BUT THIS IS A RARE LOT AND SHOULDN'T BE UNDERSOLD LOVELY 
I'M GETTING VERY EXCITED SO AM I I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SALE DAY 
THIS CLARICE CLIFF TULIP PATTERN VASE HAS TRAVELLED 
ALL THE WAY FROM THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE FOR A FLOG IT VALUATION 
LET'S HOPE THE COLLECTORS ARE HERE 
ELLO ELLO ELLO WHAT'S ALL THIS THEN 
IT'S PETER'S COLLECTION OF POLICE MEMORABILIA 
WHICH NO DOUBT WILL BE OF INTEREST TO OFFICERS OF THE LAW EVERYWHERE 
AND FINALLY IS IT GREY OR IS IT LILAC THAT'S THE QUESTION 
CHARLIE AND JENNY ARE HOPING HER DOULTON FIGURE 
IS THE RARER LILAC VERSION AND SO AM I 
THE GIRL IN THE LILAC DRESS REMEMBER THIS 
CHARLIE WAS SO EXCITED AT THE VALUATION DAY 
WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO FINDING OUT IS IT REALLY WORTH THAT TWO THOUSAND MARK WELL WILL IT 
WELL IT COULD WELL DO PAUL 
BUT THE THING IS WE'VE TRACED IT TO BEING AS CATALOGUED 
IT IS IN ONE OF THE REFERENCE WORKS 
MADE BETWEEN NINETEEN SIXTEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN RIGHT 
NOT A POPULAR ONE BECAUSE OF THE TEARS AND THE SADNESS 
EARLY BREAKING OF THE MOULD AND BINGO NONE ABOUT 
SO YOU'VE GOT A RARE PIECE HERE SO WHAT'S IT WORTH 
WELL HOW LONG IS A PIECE OF STRING PAUL 
BUT YOU WILL FIND I THINK 
THAT IT SHOULD MAKE THAT TWO THOUSAND AND WHO KNOWS 
IF MY MAGIC WAND IS WORKING MAGIC IT MIGHT MAKE MORE 
WELL THERE YOU ARE YOU HEARD IT THIS IS GETTING EXCITING 
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES' TIME WE COULD SELL THIS FOR TWO THOUSAND PLUS JOHN YES WELL HERE WE GO

WILL WE GET THAT TOP END WE SHOULD DO 
A LITTLE BIT OF DAMAGE THAT'S THE ONLY THING
