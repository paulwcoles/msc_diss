IN THE OLD DAYS THE HEART OF THE HOME USED TO BE THE FIRE NOW IT'S A PLASMA SCREEN 
WE COULD GET A DECENT SUITE IN YEAH IT'S QUITE SMALL COMPARED TO THE ONES IN SOUTH AFRICA 
MY PARENTS' HOUSE IT'S ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE SIZE YES SMALL TO YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE I KNOW

STORAGE SPACE PUT THE DINING GEAR IN THERE EXACTLY

BOOKS SCUBA GEAR 
DO YOU DIVE

AH NOT TOO BAD THEY'RE FAR ENOUGH AWAY YEAH 
SHOULDN'T HEAR THEM TOO MUCH 
I'M JUST HAPPY ABOUT THE FLOOR WITH OUR DOG I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT 
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE CARPETS DO YOU THINK IT'S WOODEN FLOORS I HOPE IT'S WOOD UNDERNEATH 
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S CREAKING 
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THIS WOULD BE THE GUEST ROOM 
IT'S BIG ENOUGH FOR A DOUBLE BED DEFINITELY THERE AREN'T ANY CUPBOARDS 
AH THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN AND YOU BUY YOURSELF WHAT'S CALLED A WARDROBE 
AH THE MAIN BEDROOM THIS'LL BE OURS AWESOME OH IT'S BIG ENOUGH 
DEFINITELY STORAGE SPACE 
IS THERE ENOUGH CUPBOARDS FOR ALL YOUR CLOTHES THEN PERHAPS I'LL TAKE THAT SECTION AND YOU CAN HAVE THAT 
I'LL HAVE THE LITTLE ONES ABOVE THE BED THEN O. K. 
JUST IMAGINE HOW EXCITING THIS IS A YEAR AGO SHE'D ONLY JUST MET THIS GUY YEP 
NOW SHE'S LOOKING AT MARRYING HIM AND MOVING TO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COUNTRY TO START A BRAND NEW LIFE 
THAT'S QUITE GOOD THAT'S GREAT 
AGAIN WITH THE CARPET YEP CARPETS MUST COME UP 
YEAH BUT IT'S ALL GOOD SHE CAN PUT HER OWN MARK ON THINGS 
WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE FIRST MARRIED IN YOUR FIRST HOME SURELY 
WHAT PUT A MARK ON YOUR CARPETS 
OH WOW WHAT'S UP HERE 
OH MORE STAIRS BUT THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL THEY'RE WOODEN STUNNING 
EXCELLENT ANOTHER ROOM 
THEY HAVEN'T MADE MUCH COMMENT ABOUT THE FACT THAT TO GET UPSTAIRS YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A BEDROOM 
OH BEAUTIFUL THIS IS BETTER 
THIS CAN BE THE PLAY ROOM IN FIVE YEARS TIME 
YES 
SHE'S GETTING EXCITED ABOUT THIS PLACE 
I'M A BIT WORRIED BECAUSE THE ONLY TOILET IS DOWNSTAIRS AND THROUGH THE BACK OF THE KITCHEN 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IT'S A LONG WAY TO GO 
ROOM'S NOT BAD IT'S BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FROM OUTSIDE 
SO THAT IS GOOD THERE'S A BIT MORE TOO IT SO 
IT'S GOT A LOT OF CHARACTER I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT 
O. K. TIME TO SEE IF ADMIRALTY COTTAGES FLOATS THEIR BOAT 
NOW YOU LIKED SOME THINGS YOU CERTAINLY LIKED THE FIREPLACE 
DEFINITELY YOU DEFINITELY DIDN'T LIKE THE DOWNSTAIRS TOILET NO 
NO ALL RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE NOT EVERYTHING'S A PROBLEM 
I THINK UP HERE THE BEDROOM IS SWEET BUT THEY'VE SQUEEZED IN THREE BEDROOMS UP HERE O. K. 
AND BEARING IN MIND THAT IT'S A LISTED PROPERTY 
SO EVERYTHING YOU DO HAS TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS FOR SURE 
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT BATHROOM

CERTAINLY IS QUITE PRIVATE 
SECLUDED YEAH AND AS A SCUBA DIVING COUPLE YOU HAVE A LOT OF EQUIPMENT 
OH LOTS OF JUST TALK ME THROUGH IT 
WET SUITS CYLINDERS BCDS REGULATORS 
O. K. THAT'S ENOUGH THERE'S A LOT MORE 
SO THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF AND IT'S WET AND SALTY YEAH 
THING TO DO IS INSTEAD OF DRAGGING IT THROUGH THE HOUSE 
BECAUSE PRESUMABLY THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT IT GETS DUMPED IN THE BATH 
THERE ARE SLIGHTLY TRICKY PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS PUTTING A BATHROOM HERE 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET ALL THE WASTE OUT YOU CAN'T GET IT OUT THE FRONT YOU'D HAVE TO GET IT OUT THE BACK 
THERE ARE WAYS AROUND THAT YOU CAN DO THAT OR GO OUT THE SIDE 
AND THEN SO THAT IS A GOOD SIZE BATHROOM FOR YOU ISN'T IT THAT WOULD BE PERFECT 
YOU PROBABLY LIKE TWO OR THREE BATHROOMS WOULDN'T YOU 
YES AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE WE HAVE THREE 
TOUGH 
TAKE IT DOWN THIS SIDE ACCESS 
BRING IT THROUGH THE GATE AND THEN HANG IT UP TO DRY IN THE SHED 
AND CAN EVEN GIVE IT A NICE LITTLE HOSE DOWN AS WELL 
HOSE PIPE SAVES THE BATH YEAH 
THE OTHER THING IS WILL YOU LIKE THE PRICE

IT'S VERY HOMEY BUT ALSO NOT CLAUSTROPHOBIC 
I LIKE THE COLOUR THOUGH NICE NEUTRAL COLOUR

IT'S A GOOD SIZE ROOM YOU CAN STILL GET AGAIN MORE WARDROBE SPACE 
BED SPACE THERE'S A GARDEN AS WELL OH THERE'S SOMETHING AT THE BACK 
LOOKS LIKE A SHED OR A GARAGE OR SOMETHING SCUBA GEAR YES 
YOU SEE THAT BROWN BUILDING THERE THE SHED 
IT'S NOT A SHED IT'S A GARAGE AND WHAT'S MORE 
IT'S BIGGER THAN THE AVERAGE GARAGE 
IT COULD FIT IN A CAR AND ALL HIS SCUBA EQUIPMENT AND YOUR BARBECUE KIT 
OH WOW THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL A BATHROOM JENNY WELL DONE

THANK YOU MY FRIEND WELL DONE JEN

THIS WOULD JUST HAVE TO BE LEFT AS IS THIS IS FANTASTIC 
THANK YOU JENNY YEAH CHEERS JENNY 
I DIDN'T DO THE BATHROOM 
OH THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 
NOW THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL A MASTER BEDROOM DEFINITELY 
NICE NICE NICE THIS IS FANTASTIC THIS IS BEAUTIFUL THIS IS HUGE 
THE SIZE OF THIS ROOM IS VERY IMPRESSIVE 
THERE ARE TWO VERY BIG WARDROBES A DOUBLE BED 
AND THERE IS STILL ROOM TO DO SOME BREAK DANCING AND A SOFA AND A SOFA 
YOU CAN PUT THE T. V. UP ON TOP AS WELL 
WE CAN YEAH YEAH 
COULD EVEN PUT A COMPUTER OR SOMETHING IN HERE 
WHY WOULD YOU WANT A COMPUTER IN THE BEDROOM 
OH THAT'S NOT A GOOD START FOR NOT FOR NEWLYWEDS NO NO 
LOOK AT THE VIEW 
STUNNING VIEW OUTSIDE OH WOW THAT IS STUNNING 
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE SHIPS STILL TIED UP WOW 
CHALK CLIFFS OVER THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S AMAZING IT'S GREAT 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
IF YOUR MUM AND DAD COME OVER DO YOU THINK THAT 
THEY WOULD BE IMPRESSED WITH YOUR FIRST HOUSE 
THEY WOULD BE IMPRESSED YEAH THIS COULD BE QUITE A GOOD FIRST HOUSE I THINK SO 
NOW IT'S FAIR TO SAY ALAN YOU LOVE THE INSIDE OF THE HOUSE 
CERTAINLY DO IT'S MASSIVE INSIDE YEAH 
LOVE THAT BATHROOM IT'S GREAT ISN'T IT 
SUCH AN AMAZING SIGHT INSIDE AND IT'S SO BIG 
YEAH THE GUY WHO OWNED IT HAS DONE A LOT OF NICE THINGS CERTAINLY HAS VERY IMPRESSED 
BUT WHAT HE HASN'T DONE IS THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE THAT IS THE DRAWBACK 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WITH HIM 
BECAUSE THIS IS CEMENT CEMENT DOESN'T MOVE DOESN'T FLEX 
SO THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF MOVEMENT A BIT OF DAMP THAT GETS BEHIND IT 
AS IT GETS HOT AND COLD IT WILL CAUSE CRACKS IN IT 
NOT A PROBLEM BUT SOMETIMES IN CERTAIN AREAS THE PEBBLE DASH WILL BLOW 
WHICH IS LIKE PLASTER WHEN YOU TAP ON THE WALL YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR IT'S HOLLOW O. K. 
THE THING TO DO THERE GET THE BLOWN BITS GET THEM HACKED OFF O. K. 
PATCH IT UP OR EVEN BETTER GET THE WHOLE LOT RE PEBBLE DASHED 
SEEMS A STRANGE THING TO DO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE A BIT 
BUT IT GIVES A COMPLETELY FRESH LOOK AND NEW PEBBLE DASH DOES LOOK BETTER THAN OLD 
GIVES IT THAT FINISHED OFF FEEL O. K. 
BUT I'M AFRAID TO SAY I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HACK IT OFF 
THE BRICKS ARE UGLY UNDERNEATH AND RENDERING OVER THE TOP 
WILL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A BIG STRANGE WHITE BOX 
NO THAT SOUNDS ACTUALLY WORSE 
SO I THINK THIS IS HOW IT WAS DESIGNED 
AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO BUY INTO IT IF YOU LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSE O. K. FAIR ENOUGH 
ARE YOU WILLING TO PAY FOR PEBBLE DASH THAT IS THE QUESTION WELL THE INSIDE COULD BE WORTH IT 
I RECKON SO IT DEPENDS ON PRICE IT DEPENDS ON PRICE AND I TELL YOU WHAT YOUR FIANCEE 
WHO COMES FROM A DIFFERENT PART OF THE WORLD AND HAS NO IDEA ABOUT PROPERTY PRICES IS ONE UP 
I'M KIND OF SORT OF SHAMED BY THAT PRESSURE'S ON AFTER YOU THANK YOU

WHERE JENNY POWELL WILL BECOME UNBEARABLE IF YOU KEEP GIVING HER PATS ON THE BACK LIKE THAT 
THERE'S A LOT OF HOUSE A LOT OF ROOM 
YOUR BUDGET WE'VE SAID IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY 
WHO'S GOING TO GO FIRST 
ALAN CAN GO FIRST YEAH BECAUSE ALAN DIDN'T WIN LAST TIME 
YOU WERE RUBBISH LAST TIME PROBABLY BE THE SAME AGAIN 
FOR THE HOUSE WE ARE GETTING I THINK IT MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY OVER BUDGET 
MAYBE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO AND A HALF ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO AND A HALF O. K. 
KELLY SHE'S DOING A BIG 
ER I WANT TO SAY TWO HUNDRED

IT'S THE WILDCARD PROPERTY WHICH MIGHT JUST THROW THINGS UP IN THE AIR 
IT'S TIME TO GO AND SEE IT'S THIS WAY SO FOLLOW ME FANTASTIC 
AND FOR OUR WILDCARD TODAY 
STANDING TO ATTENTION IS THIS TWO DOUBLE BEDROOM APARTMENT IN GOSPORT 
A GRADE TWO LISTED GEORGIAN BUILDING THE REASON SHE'S TALKING LIKE THAT 
IS BECAUSE WE ARE WITHIN THE OFFICERS QUARTERS AT THE ROYAL CLARENCE YARD 
AND THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL CONVERSION 
HIGH CEILINGS A LARGE LOUNGE AND AMAZING SASH WINDOWS 
ALAN YES KELLY YES LISTEN UP 
HERE WE ARE WILDCARD 
IT'S A WILDCARD BECAUSE IT'S AN APARTMENT OVER TO YOU BLANDFORD 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE IS A REASON WE ARE TALKING LIKE THIS AND I'LL STOP NOW 
THIS USED TO BE OFFICERS BARRACKS YOU MIGHT HAVE GUESSED THAT 
IT LOOKS VERY KIND OF ORDERLY DOESN'T IT CERTAINLY DOES 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS THE HEIGHT OF THE CEILINGS 
AND THE SIZE OF THE WINDOWS BECAUSE IT'S GEORGIAN 
SERGEANT MAJOR IT COMES SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN REALLY 
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE PERIOD FEATURES OR THE PERIOD FEEL BECAUSE IT'S GEORGIAN 
BUT ALSO IT HAS JUST BEEN DONE UP SO IT'S VERY MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY 
A COMPROMISE IT IS 
THAT'S A COMPROMISE YOU'RE CATCHING UP 
I'M GETTING GOOD AT THIS SO HERE WE HAVE THE COMPROMISE 
HOWEVER THE BIG THING IS OF COURSE LIKE IAN SAYS IT'S NOT A HOUSE NO IT'S AN APARTMENT 
WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THIS KIND OF PLACE 
GARDEN OR LACK OF FOR THE DOG THAT'S THE FIRST BIG THING O. K. 
NEIGHBOURS LIVING ABOVE US I THINK 
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE TAP DANCERS 
COULD GET A BIT ANNOYING 
THE THING TO THINK THOUGH IS VERY THICK WALLS 
VERY SOLID I DON'T THINK YOU'D HAVE TOO MUCH PROBLEM WITH NOISE 
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD JUST POINT OUT IT'S EMPTY 
SO YOU NEED TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION HERE YOUR FURNITURE AND THE COLOURS THAT YOU'D USE O. K. SURE 
WE SHOULD DISMISS THEM OR SOMETHING SHOULDN'T WE YES O. K. 
ALAN KELLY DISMISSED OFF YOU GO FABULOUS

BUT THAT JUST THE SIZE THE SPACE I LIKED IT YEAH 
YEAH AND TO BOOT ON TOP OF THAT BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T QUITE SEE 
YOU GET A RATHER LARGE IMPRESSIVE COMMUNAL GARDEN 
THIS HAS DEFINITELY MADE IT EVEN BETTER 
SO IT'S IMPRESSIVE IT'S A PERIOD PROPERTY 
I KNOW IT'S A BLANK CANVAS AND I THINK YOU LIKE THAT IDEA 
CERTAINLY DID YES DEFINITELY 
DID SOMEONE MENTION BLANK CANVAS 
NO NO I WASN'T IMPLYING ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
I'VE COME TO ADD A BIT OF COLOUR TO YOUR LIFE YEAH 
I SEE WE ONLY HAVE ONE MORE THING TO DO NOW THEN

IT'S INTERESTING AS WELL BECAUSE WE'RE EVEN STEVENS AT THE MOMENT YEAH THE BUDGET WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY 
ONE HUNDRED NINETY SO KELLY I FEEL THAT YOU SHOULD GO FIRST THIS TIME 
AGAIN I'D SAY TWO HUNDRED ALL RIGHT TWO HUNDRED ALAN

TWO HUNDRED TWO O. K. 
RIGHT WELL I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE KELLY 
A VERY HAPPY BUNNY BECAUSE YOU'VE WON YAY 
BUT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU BOTH HAPPY BUNNIES 
BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY YOU'RE JOKING 
OH MY WORD IT'S THE CHEAPEST OF THE THREE IT IS THE CHEAPER 
BUT A COUPLE OF THINGS TO BEAR IN MIND WITH THAT 
THE OTHER TWO WERE FREEHOLD YEAH THIS IS A LEASEHOLD PROPERTY 
NOTHING TO BE TOO WORRIED ABOUT BUT YOU'VE GOT A GROUND RENT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT EVERY YEAR 
AND THAT IS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EVERY YEAR SO IT'S NOT BANKRUPTING 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD 
WELL HERE COMES CRUNCH TIME BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WANDERING AROUND 
SHOWING YOU ALL THESE LOVELY PROPERTIES YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE A CHOICE THOUGH

AND DON'T FORGET THAT MASSIVE BEDROOM WITH A GREAT SEA VIEW 
IT COULD BE THE PERFECT CATCH AT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH JENNY 
I THINK THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY OPT FOR PROPERTY NUMBER THREE OUR WILDCARD 
THEY WERE COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY BY THE TWO DOUBLE BEDROOMED 
GRADE TWO LISTED GEORGIAN APARTMENT IN GOSPORT 
YEP IT'S AN IMPRESSIVE PAD WITH A CERTAIN AIR OF GRANDEUR
