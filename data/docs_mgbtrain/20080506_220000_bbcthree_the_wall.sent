TO NIGHT S. 
TONIGHT S. YOU'RE COMING OUT TONIGHT 
YOU'RE COMING OUT TONIGHT 
WE ARE GOING OUT TONIGHT 
WE WON'T BE SHINING LIKE THAT FAR 
TONIGHT TONIGHT ASK YOURSELF WHY 
JUST ASK YOUR MAN WHY 
ODDLY AND YOU LIE 
AND TO CRISSCROSS CRISSCROSS 
STILL LIGHT POP SIGH POP EYE 
YOU ARE COMING OUT TONIGHT 
COME ON OUT TONIGHT 
SHE IS THERE AND FAIR AND BRIGHT 
DON'T START TRYING NOW 
DON'T CRY NOW 
JUST A GLOOMY SKY FOR US TONIGHT 
YOU'RE NOT NOW 
THE SKY IS MORE CLOSE TO US 
TONIGHT TONIGHT AND AS FOR YOU FRIEND 
WATCHING US SO CLOSE 
POURING DOWN LIKE RAIN 
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY 
FEEL REALLY LONELY 
COS WE'RE CHANGING EVERY SINGLE 
THING THING GOING OUT TONIGHT
