IS THUNDERSTORMS 
IT OFTEN IS DURING THE SUMMER 
THEY ARE NOW KICKING OFF ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
SOME QUITE SEVERE ELECTRICAL STORMS THAT HAVE MOVED 
ACROSS THE CHANNEL FROM FRANCE DURING THE EVENING 
NO WONDER THE MET OFFICE HAS A SEVERE WEATHER WARNING OUT 
ACCOMPANYING THOSE FLASHES AND BANGS SOME TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS 
ARE EXPECTED AS WELL 
AS MUCH AS TWENTY TO THIRTY M. M. OF RAIN FALLING DURING THE NIGHT 
AND FIRST THING IN THE MORNING ACROSS SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND SOUTH WALES 
IT'LL BE HORRENDOUS ON THE ROADS 
NO PROBLEMS WITH TEMPERATURES JUST A TAD CHILLY IN NORTH WEST SCOTLAND 
TO THE NORTH OF THAT RAIN BAND IT SHOULD BE A DECENT START TO THE DAY 
ACROSS NORTH WEST WALES NORTHERN IRELAND AND WESTERN SCOTLAND 
VERY LITTLE CHANGE FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY ON THURSDAY 
THE LOW CLOUD THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUING COASTAL COUNTIES OF SCOTLAND 
EASTERN COASTAL COUNTIES THAT IS ALONG WITH NORTH EAST ENGLAND 
WILL CREEP BACK INLAND DURING THE NIGHT 
SO IT WILL START RATHER GREY AND COOL HERE IN THE MORNING 
BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM FOR TRAVELLERS WILL BE THIS SWATHE OF HEAVY 
POTENTIALLY TORRENTIAL AND THUNDERY RAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF 
OF THE COUNTRY 
SOME THUNDERSTORMS WITH IT BUT THE ROADS WILL BE QUITE SLICK 
AS IT'S BEEN SO DRY GREAT NEWS FOR GROWERS 
THAT AMOUNT OF PROMISED RAIN JUST NOT GOOD NEWS IF YOU DRIVE IN IT 
THROUGH THE DAY IT WILL HEAD FURTHER NORTH 
ALLOWING SOMEWHAT BRIGHTER WEATHER TO COME IN TO THE SOUTH EVENTUALLY 
BUT THAT WILL TRIGGER SHOWERS 
ELSEWHERE YOU CAN SEE THE CLOUD BEING NIBBLED AWAY 
SO IT WILL BRIGHTEN UP IN SOME EASTERN PARTS OF 
NORTH EAST ENGLAND PERHAPS LINCOLNSHIRE AND YORKSHIRE 
STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF SEEING MORE BRIGHTNESS THAN WE'VE SEEN TODAY 
ON THE WHOLE IT WILL ONCE AGAIN BE COOL AND CLOUDY FOR 
NORTH EAST ENGLAND EASTERN SCOTLAND AND THE NORTHERN ISLES 
WHILST WESTERN SCOTLAND ALTHOUGH THERE'S A SMALL CHANCE OF A SHOWER 
WILL HAVE ANOTHER LOVELY DAY AS WE WILL SEE ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
TEMPERATURES INTO THE HIGH TEENS 
NORTH WEST ENGLAND NOT BAD NORTH WALES HOLDING ONTO 
THE BRIGHTNESS UNTIL LATER 
MANY PARTS OF WALES WILL SEE SOME NASTY RAIN COMING IN FOR A TIME 
FURTHER SOUTH ONCE THE MAIN RAIN CLEARS AWAY 
AND WE SEE HOLES IN THE CLOUD APPEARING 
THAT WILL TRIGGER SOME HEAVY EVEN THUNDERY SHOWERS HERE 
AND PROBABLY SOME COASTAL FOG 
THINGS WILL HAVE COOLED DOWN AND MOISTENED UP 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN BUT THEY'LL BE HELD UP 
OVERNIGHT AND INTO FRIDAY BY THAT CLOUD 
STILL SOME PATCHY RAIN AROUND BUT IT WILL FEEL MUCH CHILLIER BY DAY AND 
BY NIGHT BECAUSE OF THE FRESH EASTERLY WIND 
FRIDAY SEES A LOT OF CLOUD FOR WALES THE MIDLANDS AND SOUTHERN ENGLAND 
FEELING COOLER WITH THE BREEZE BLOWING IN FROM THE EAST 
AND SOME SHOWERS 
SOME SHOWERS FOR SCOTLAND STARTING TO MATERIALISE ON FRIDAY 
THE MAIN CHANGE OVER THE WEEKEND IS MUCH COOLER AIR COMES IN 
ACROSS SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
IT'S JUST A SHOWERY PICTURE EVEN THOUGH THERE WILL BE 
ACROSS CENTRAL PARTS QUITE A LOT OF DRY AND FINE WEATHER 
THE SOUTH WILL BE MORE PRONE TO SHOWERS THAT'S THE FORECAST
