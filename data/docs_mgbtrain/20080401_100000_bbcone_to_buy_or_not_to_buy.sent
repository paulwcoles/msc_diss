HELLO WELCOME TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY THE PROPERTY SHOW 
THAT IN ONE FELL SWOOP WILL FIND YOU THREE LOVELY HOMES TO VIEW 
MAKING THOSE HOUSE HUNTING BLUES DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR 
LEAVING YOU FREE TO TRY BEFORE YOU BUY 
OH ED I'M FEELING INSPIRED TODAY 
I FEEL I COULD PUT A GIRDLE AROUND ABOUT THE EARTH IN FORTY MINUTES 
THEN THE WORLD'S YOUR OYSTER KRISTIAN BUT FIRST 
WE HAVE TO FIND THREE PROPERTIES IN THE HAMLET 
OF STRATFORD UPON AVON 
YES ED THAT'S TRUE BUT IN MY MIND'S EYE AND AS GOOD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT 
I KNOW THE AREA WELL AND FEEL WE WILL FIND THREE LOVELY PROPERTIES 
WELL KRISTIAN LEND ME YOUR EARS AND LET'S BEGIN THE SHOW 
WHY YOURS ARE QUITE LOVELY THANK YOU 
WELL IT'S CERTAINLY A FAMILY AFFAIR TODAY FOR MARK AND LEANNE SAINSBURY 
THEIR HOUSE IS SO FULL IT'S THE REASON WHY THEY'RE MOVING 
GOODNESS YES WITH CONNOR ED FINN JIM MACK AND FREYA THE LATEST ADDITION 
AND WITH GRANDPARENTS ON HAND TO HELP IT'S A HOUSEFUL 
LEANNE AND MARK LIVE NEAR WORCESTER BUT WOULD LIKE TO RELOCATE TO STRATFORD 
SO LEANNE AND MARK I HAVE BEEN RELIABLY INFORMED THAT WE HAVE QUITE A BIG HOUSE HUNTING CHALLENGE 
ON OUR HANDS TODAY IS THIS TRUE OR JUST A TERRIBLE LIE 
IT'S TERRIBLY TRUE WE HAVE LOTS OF CHILDREN AND A DOG AND CAT TO ACCOMMODATE A DOG AND CAT 
JEEZ HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR A WHILE YES WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING BECAUSE THE CHILDREN ARE COMING UP TO THE SORT OF SECONDARY SCHOOL STAGE 
AND IT'S IMPORTANT NOW TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS FOR THE NEXT SORT OF FIVE TO TEN YEARS 
SO YOU'RE AT THAT POINT MOST PARENTS FIND YOU MUST GET SOMEWHERE NEAR SCHOOLS 
HAVE YOU GOT SCHOOLS OF CHOICE ANY OF THE SCHOOLS AROUND HERE SEEM TO BE OF A GOOD STANDARD 
O. K. WE'D LIKE TO CHOOSE ONE OF THE SCHOOLS AROUND HERE 
SO I THINK WE SHOULD JUST LITERALLY FIND OUT WHAT YOUR DREAM PROPERTY WOULD BE 
THROW EVERYTHING AT US AND WE'LL SIFT THROUGH IT AND OFFER YOU SOME STUFF AFTERWARDS 
RIGHT WELL WE NEED BEDROOMS WE HAVE FIVE BOYS AND A BABY GIRL 
RIGHT SO SIX BEDROOMS REALLY WOULD BE IDEAL 
A GARDEN WOULD BE GOOD ERM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TERRIBLY BIG 
BUT WE'D LIKE A LAWN FOR THE FOOTBALL AND AN AREA FOR US TO SIT AS WELL 
SO THAT WOULD BE GOOD AND WHAT ABOUT YOU 
OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT NICE ENTERTAINING SPACES DINING ROOMS I MEAN GO ON SPOIL YOURSELVES 
IDEALLY WHAT WE WOULD LIKE IS WE'D LIKE FAIRLY BIG ROOMS 
WHEN WE'RE ALL TOGETHER WE HAVE SORT OF PARENTS 
GRANDPARENTS ERM SIX CHILDREN WE LIKE TO EAT TOGETHER TO DINE TOGETHER 
WE LIKE TO SOCIALISE TOGETHER QUITE A LOT 
YOU'LL NEED A BIG KITCHEN TO FEED SIX PEOPLE 
WE NEED A BIG KITCHEN WE WOULD LOVE A DINING ROOM SO WE CAN HAVE A NICE LONG TABLE 
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS A HOTEL 
YEAH IS THAT NOT RIGHT IT WOULD WORK 
ARE YOU GONNA SAY WE'D LIKE A BIT OF CHARACTER 
WE WOULD LIKE A BIT OF CHARACTER PREFERABLY HOWEVER IT'S REALLY 
THE SPACE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AT THIS STAGE O. K. 
BUT I THINK AROUND HERE IT'S AN OLD ENOUGH AREA SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE QUITE LUCKY 
AND WE BRING OUR OWN CHARACTER AS WELL YOU DO 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PRISTINE WE'RE QUITE HAPPY TO PUT OUR OWN STAMP ON IT AS WELL SO 
IF YOU'RE SAYING CHARACTER WOULD YOU BE INFLUENCED BY A NEW BUILD 
OR IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'D JUST GIVE A COLD SHOULDER TO 
NOT NECESSARILY BUT OUR PROBLEM WITH NEW BUILDS IS THAT SOMETIMES THE ROOMS ARE FAIRLY TIGHT 
ECONOMICAL ON SPACE YEAH AND AS I SAID WE QUITE LIKE TO BE ALL IN ONE ROOM 
OR ALL TOGETHER EATING TOGETHER AND WE JUST NEED THE BIG ROOMS 
SOMETIMES THE PLOT WITH THE NEW BUILD IS QUITE SMALL 
LAND IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE THESE DAYS 
SO IT'S TO DO WITH SPACE WITH THE NEW BUILD NOT THE STYLE OF THE NEW BUILD YES IT IS 
BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TOWN PROPERTY YOU'RE GONNA EXPECT 
TO COMPROMISE ON THE SPACE OF THE GARDEN AND WE ACCEPT THAT 
SO YOU WON'T COMPROMISE ON THE AMOUNT OF ROOMS YOU WON'T COMPROMISE ON THAT 
BUT YOU COULD COMPROMISE ON OUTDOOR SPACE YEAH 
WOULD YOU COMPROMISE ON LOCATION 
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STRATFORD UPON AVON 
PREFERABLY WE WOULD LIKE TO BE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE MAIN ROADS THAT WE DON'T HEAR IT 
ON AN INTRUSIVE BASIS AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A FLIGHT PATH AROUND HERE 
WE'LL FIND ONE SO THAT WOULD BE PREFERABLE NOT TO HAVE THAT O. K. 
AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO HAVE A NICE FRONT DOOR 
WITH AN ENTRANCE HALL AND A NICE STAIRCASE THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE A BONUS 
AND A ROOF WOULD BE NICE A ROOF 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I CAN DO THE STAIRCASE I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE ROOF 
WE'RE NEAR THE UNCOMFORTABLE POINT I THINK 
YEAH I GUESS ALL THAT SOUNDS DOABLE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA ASK WE DO 
O. K. SO JUST TAKE IT AWAY ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY 
THAT'S A GOOD CHUNK OF MONEY THAT'S GOOD 
SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A HOTEL FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND NOT SO EASY NO 
WE'RE GONNA GO OFF AND KIND OF EMBRACE OUR PROPERTY HUNTING TEAM IN THE LOCAL AREA 
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN GET O. K. WE'LL SEE YOU LATER 
TAKE A LOVELY STROLL ENJOY YOURSELVES O. K. THANK YOU

YOU'RE MISSING A TRICK YOU ARE MISSING A TRICK HE'S GONE 
ALAS POOR ED I KNEW HIM SO WELL 
OH DARLINGS STRATFORD UPON AVON A FLOURISHING MARKET TOWN IN THE HEART OF WARWICKSHIRE 
IT'S BEEN PUT ON THE CULTURAL AND TOURIST MAPS OF THE WORLD 
BY THE BIRTH OF ONE WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR 
AROUND FIVE MILLION PEOPLE VISIT HERE EACH YEAR FOR THE SHAKESPEAREAN EXPERIENCE BUT YOU CAN ESCAPE 
THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE BY TAKING A WANDER ALONG THE BANKS 
OF THE RIVER AVON WITH JUST THE SWANS FOR COMPANY 
AND A CHANCE TO SOAK UP SOME RURAL TRANQUILLITY 
UNSURPRISINGLY STRATFORD IS A HIGHLY DESIRABLE LOCATION 
AND WITH A RESIDENT POPULATION OF TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND 
GOOD SCHOOLS AND EASY ACCESS TO MOTORWAYS DEMAND FOR PROPERTY IS HIGH 
WITH A LARGE FAMILY TO HOUSE THIS COULD PROVE EXPENSIVE BUT HOW FAR DOES 
TODAY'S HEALTHY BUDGET OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND STRETCH IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
WELL FRANKLY KRISTIAN IN S. W. ONE LONDON NOT THAT FAR 
IN FACT IT'LL ONLY GET YOU THIS ONE BED FLAT SIX HUNDRED TWENTY NINE SQUARE FEET OF PROPERTY

THIS GEORGIAN GEM WITH THE SUN RISING BEHIND IT BUT ACTUALLY BUILT IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
SO NOT A GEORGIAN GEM AFTER ALL JUST A FAUX GEORGIAN GEM BUT WHAT A GEM IT IS

SO SHOULD WE COMMENCE THE SHOW AT PROPERTY NUMBER

I'M NOTHING SHORT OF PROUD TO PRESENT MY OFFERING A PERFECTLY FORMED FAMILY RESIDENCE 
SITTING IN A PRETTY VILLAGE A FEW MILES OUTSIDE STRATFORD

GETTING THE PICTURE IT'S A VERY PLEASANT HOUSE NICE LOCATION 
PLEASANT YEAH 
LET'S CRANK IT UP A LITTLE BIT IT'S ABSOLUTELY MARVELLOUS THANK YOU 
IS IT ACTUALLY A NEW BUILD 
IT IS IT'S BASICALLY A BABY ONLY A FEW YEARS OLD 
BUT I THINK BLENDING IN QUITE NICELY ARCHITECTURALLY 
YEAH IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL WHETHER IT'S NEW OR OLD WITH THE BRICKWORK AND EVERYTHING 
THEY'VE DONE IT QUITE SYMPATHETICALLY I LIKE THE DESIGN 
SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE HOUSE YOU DON'T LIKE 
I THINK THE HOUSE LOOKS VERY NICE BUT I AM WONDERING WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE BIG ENOUGH 
YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT I HAVE LET YOU DOWN 
I'M NOT SPEAKING TO YOU AGAIN GO I'M SORRY I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING TO PROVE ME WRONG 
WELL GO IN THERE AND ENJOY IT AND THEN MAYBE COME OUT AND PUNCH HIM ON THE NOSE IF HE HAS LET YOU DOWN 
FAIR ENOUGH I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION

YEAH WHY HAVE YOU LET THEM DOWN 
NO QUARTER OF AN ACRE BEDROOMS EN SUITES HOW MANY BEDROOMS 
WELL YOU'VE LET THEM DOWN HE'S LET THEM DOWN 
I HAVEN'T IT'S ABOUT REARRANGING THE ROOM SPACE YOU'LL SEE 
I'M VERY EXCITED THIS COULD BE A VERY SHORT EPISODE 
THIS HOUSE IS PERFECT YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT 
I'M FEELING INFALLIBLE THAT'S A NICE SPACIOUS ENTRANCE ISN'T IT 
LEANNE WANTED AN ENTRANCE HALL WITH AN IMPRESSIVE STAIRCASE I'VE DELIVERED 
THAT'S MY TYPE OF ROOM JUST THROUGH THERE PINBALL WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK IT'S A USEFUL LITTLE ROOM AT THE BACK 
THESE ARE WHAT I'D CALL FRIPPERIES THEY'RE JUST HAVE A CASUAL ROOM HAVE AN EXTRA ROOM 
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT A FRIPPERY BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY 
VITAL TO THE HOUSE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SUPPLIED ENOUGH BEDROOMS O. K. 
HE'S CERTAINLY BETTER THAN OUR DOG ISN'T HE BETTER BEHAVED 
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD ACTUALLY IS IT 
IT'S A NICE SIZED ROOM YEAH IT IS 
NICE AND WARM THAT'S THE NICE THING ABOUT MODERN HOUSES THERE'S NOT SO MANY DRAUGHTS 
BUT AGAIN IT IS QUITE COMPACT ISN'T IT FROM THE FRONT 
YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSE AND YOU THINK THAT'S A PRETTY REASONABLY SIZED HOUSE 
THEN AS YOU COME IN EACH ROOM YOU KNOW IS TO MY MIND IT'S QUITE 
IT'S QUITE PETITE REALLY ISN'T IT 
AAAARRRGH 
THAT SCREAMING FROM THE GARDEN MUST BE TO DO WITH KRISTIAN I THINK 
I THINK IT WAS THE WORD PETITE IT'S NOT PETITE THAT'S A VERY USEFUL UTILITY ROOM 
YEAH THAT'S NICE YEAH THAT'S A GOOD SIZE 
AND THIS IS A NICE SIZED ROOM THAT IS ACTUALLY YOU COULD ACTUALLY EAT 
NICE AND BRIGHT CERTAINLY DO BREAKFAST HERE 
YEAH YOU COULD EAT IN HERE BUT AGAIN WHERE WOULD YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE DINING ROOM 
ERM I MEAN IS THERE SOMETHING I'M MISSING AT THE MOMENT 
THERE MIGHT BE THAT ROOM OVER THERE YEAH 
TELL ME WITH THE AMOUNT OF WORK SURFACES GOING ROUND THERE 
THE MARBLE AND IT IS ALL MARBLE HOW MANY PACKED LUNCHES 
COULD YOU CONSTRUCT ON THOSE WORK SURFACES 
O. K. SO WE'VE GOT THIS AS THE OFFICE SO REALLY THESE TWO ROOMS HERE ARE 
TWO FAIRLY COMPACT ROOMS IN TERMS OF HAVING SIX CHILDREN 
YEAH IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT OF HAVING A DINING ROOM DOES IT 
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AS A SEPARATE ROOM 
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU CAN TAKE A WALL OUT 
THE WALTONS DIDN'T HAVE A HOUSE BIGGER THAN THIS AND THEY MANAGED 
THEY WERE ON T. V. THEY DIDN'T EXIST YES THEY DIDN'T EXIST REALLY 
THIS IS A LOVELY A LOVELY LANDING I THINK 
YEAH WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A LANDING DO WE NO WE DON'T 
THAT'S THE ONE ASPECT WE DON'T HAVE AND SOME STORAGE 
FOR REGULAR VIEWERS OF THE SHOW YOU'LL KNOW THAT WE DO LOVE STORAGE 
AND THIS HOUSE YOU'VE GOT TO SAY OH IT'S GOT LOTS 
IN STORAGE IT'S IT DOESN'T STOP GIVING 
AND THIS MUST BE AN EN SUITE TO THE MASTER BEDROOM I THINK 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH IT'S A RATHER LARGE EN SUITE 
RELATIVE TO THE ACTUAL BEDROOM ITSELF ISN'T IT YEAH IT'S ER 
IT'S GOOD IN THE NUMBER OF ROOMS ISN'T IT REALLY YES 
THIS IS WHAT WE ASKED FOR WE ASKED FOR A NUMBER OF BEDROOMS AND I THINK YOU KNOW 
IT'S A NICE BLANK CANVAS TO WORK WITH A NICE EN SUITE HERE YEAH 
THAT'S A MUST IN A MODERN HOUSE ISN'T IT THAT'S ONE 
THAT'S QUITE DECEPTIVE ACTUALLY ISN'T IT 
THAT'S A NICE SIZE I MUST ADMIT I DO LIKE THE WAY THEY'VE DONE IT 
I KNOW THAT'S IRRELEVANT BUT 
THERE'S NO ERM 
YOU COULD GET SOME CUPBOARDS IN HERE AS WELL YEAH EXACTLY 
SO ARE YOU COUNTING HOW MANY BEDROOMS THERE ARE SO FAR TWO THAT'S TWO 
THEY'RE GONNA START A TALLY ON THE BEDROOMS 
THIS COULD MAKE ME NERVOUS AND TWITCHY YOU HAVE A BRILLIANT SOLUTION FOR THAT 
I DO MOVE THE FAMILY DOWNSTAIRS IT'S ALL RIGHT SLEEP IN THE LOUNGE 
THIS I PRESUME IS ANOTHER BEDROOM 
YEAH THAT'S NUMBER THREE ANOTHER BATHROOM IN HERE 
LET ME HAVE A LOOK

IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S SO CLEAN AND MODERN AND YOU KNOW

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN NICELY PAINTED NO KICK MARKS AND STUFF FROM THE CHILDREN 
DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK 
BEDROOM NUMBER FOUR 
YEAH 
SO LOTS OF BUILT IN CUPBOARDS MARK 
WHICH I THINK IS VERY USEFUL 
THE UPSTAIRS IS DEFINITELY BETTER FOR US THAN THE DOWNSTAIRS 
THE CHILDREN WILL LOVE THE NUMBER AND THE SIZE OF THE BEDROOMS 
AND JUST HAVING SOME SPACE TO THEMSELVES SORRY I'VE JUST GOT TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK IN THIS CUPBOARD 
AND THIS MUST BE 
ANOTHER CUPBOARD 
HE'S HAVING A CUPBOARD MOMENT 
IF ALL ELSE FAILS SHOW PEOPLE CUPBOARDS AND YOU'RE LAUGHING

I'D BE INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT SORT OF GARDEN WE HAVE TO GO WITH IT O. K. 
AND WHAT PLOT IT STANDS ON 
GO IN THERE AND APPRECIATE THE DRYNESS 
AND THE BEAUTY OF THIS PROPERTY O. K. WE WILL THANK YOU 
I'M OFF I'M OFF

SOME DAYS YOU CAN EVEN SEE A RAINBOW 
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK 
NICE ENTRANCE HALLWAY THE DOOR SEEMS TO WORK WELL 
THE DOOR SEEMS TO WORK QUITE WELL 
THIS IS A NICE SIZE ROOM MARK 
IT IS ISN'T IT AND ALSO I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT THE WINDOWS AT EITHER END

RIGHT O. K. THAT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT SMALL UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING ROUND THE SIDE 
YEAH IT'S AGAIN THIS NEW HOUSE CONCEPT ISN'T IT 
PUTTING IT ON A SMALL PLOT WHICH IS ALWAYS QUITE 
QUITE DIFFICULT TO GET AWAY FROM REALLY ISN'T IT 
NOT LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS 
HOW OLD IS MARK 
HARKING AFTER THE GOOD OLD DAYS 
LET'S GO THIS WAY RIGHT 
O. K. THIS IS A NICE ENTRANCE HALL

IF THE CHILDREN SEE THOSE THAT'S IT WE'VE HAD IT 
JIMMY WOULD LOVE THAT YEAH WOULDN'T HE JUST 
STILL AGAIN NICE AND BRIGHT YOU KNOW PLENTY OF SPACE 
BETWEEN US THE PRICE OF THIS HOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
I'M NOT SAYING WHAT THE PRICE IS YOU'VE SPOILT GUESS THE PRICE

I PRESUME SO YES 
YOU WOULDN'T WASTE THAT BED ON GUESTS WOULD YOU 
NICE NICE VIEWS AS WELL 
WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT'S A FIRST FOR TODAY'S SHOW A THREE LEVEL HOUSE 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS HOUSE IS THAT IT'S GOT A BEDROOM FOR EVERYBODY YES 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED 
THIS IS A NICE SIZE YEAH THAT'S A GOOD SIZE 
IT'S JUST HAVING THAT ABILITY TO HOUSE EVERYBODY 
AND BECAUSE IT'S SO LIGHT AND BRIGHT 
THE CHILDREN AREN'T GOING TO BE SCARED OR WORRIED ABOUT BEING UP HERE ON THEIR OWN 
THEY'VE EVEN GOT THEIR OWN BATHROOM HERE OH WOW 
THIS AIN'T NO ORDINARY EN SUITE HERE IT IS A. WAIT FOR IT 
OH 
JACK AND JILL YES 
SO THIS IS A SHARED BATHROOM FOR THE TWO BEDROOMS UP HERE 
RIGHT O. K. AND THEY'RE USING THIS OBVIOUSLY AS AN OFFICE 
SO THIS IS THE SIXTH BEDROOM 
YEAH SO THAT'S JUST IDEAL 
PERFECT NUMBER ISN'T IT YES 
IT SEEMS THAT WHEN WE'VE JOINED FORCES WE'VE DONE WELL 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN FORCES AND DELIVER A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE GARDEN 
I WOULD DARNED LOVE TO 
LEANNE AND MARK WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT YOU SEEM TO LIKE IT SO MUCH 
YES SUPER NUMBER OF BEDROOMS THANKS KRISTIAN 
AND REALLY NICE GROUND FLOOR SPACE AS WELL GOOD 
SO ARE THERE ANY NEGATIVES THAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK 
FOR ME IT WOULD BE THE PLOT THAT IT'S STANDING IN 
RIGHT COS WE THOUGHT THAT IT'S NOT A BAD SIZED PLOT TO BE HONEST 
WE HAD A GAME OF FOOTBALL HERE WITH A PING PONG BALL IT WORKED 
YES TWO A SIDE IF YOU LOOK TO THE SIDE THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF LAND THERE 
YES BUT WITH FIVE GROWING LADS IT'S STILL FAIRLY SMALL IN COMPARISON 
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO DO IT OR NOT 
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO TELL THEM AREN'T WE RIGHT IT'S NEGOTIABLE 
FOR A FEE THERE IS SOME MORE LAND 
I WILL NOW DEMONSTRATE DO WANT TO TALK THROUGH THIS GO ON THEN BYE 
KRISTIAN IS HOPPING INTO RATHER GALLANTLY A FARMER'S FIELD 
RIGHT 
WE HAVEN'T REALLY WORKED THIS OUT YET 
I PRESUME THIS IS THE BORDER HE FEELS YOU COULD GET HE'S WAVING HE'S ALL OF THAT 
HE USED TO BE CABIN CREW SO THAT MOVE IS 
YOU COULD HAVE ALL OF THIS 
IT'S NOT BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH THE FARMER BUT THE GUY WHO DOES LIVE HERE 
HE SPOKE TO THE FARMER LAST NIGHT AND THE DEAL'S STILL ON 
BUT IT'S SOMETHING YOU WOULD HAVE TO STRIKE WITH HIM 
YOUR LAND PROBLEMS COULD BE RESOLVED BY PURCHASING THAT 
YEAH THAT WOULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE ACTUALLY 
YOU COULD HAVE YOUR OWN FOOTBALL TEAM 
BUT YOU COULDN'T GET THE BIT RIGHT NEXT TO THE RIVER AS THE OWNER WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN FISHING RIGHTS 
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
MIGHT GET A LONG ENOUGH FISHING ROD AND LINE IT'S YOURS AS WELL 
O. K. GUESS THE PRICE OH YES 
GO ON WE'RE EVEN STEVENS AT THE MOMENT AREN'T WE WE ARE 
IT'S BEEN APPALLING THIS I REDEEMED MYSELF I THINK IN THE LAST HOUSE 
O. K. SO WHO WOULD LIKE TO GUESS FIRST 
LEANNE LEANNE RIGHT 
AND REMEMBER ALL THE BEDROOMS NEWBOLD ON STOUR GREAT VIEWS 
O. K. I'M GOING TO GO SLIGHTLY ABOVE BUDGET BUT NOT MUCH THIS TIME 
I THINK I'M GOING TO SAY 
SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
STOP LAUGHING 
I'M NOT I ENJOY THE GUESSING 
YOU SAY THIS IS IMPORTANT THIS IS THE COME ON 
SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX YOU'VE GONE SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX ONE HIGHER 
AND THAT ONE COULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
O. K. THE ACTUAL PRICE IS FIVE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
YOU'RE JOKING 
LOOK AT THAT 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING GOODNESS 
IT'S JUST FURTHER AWAY FROM STRATFORD UPON AVON 
IT'S A GREAT HOUSE LOADS OF SPACE SO MUCH MONEY LEFT OVER 
I'M TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW FAR OUT YOU WERE THIS TIME 
IT'S INCREDIBLE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IN A LOVELY WAY I DO BELIEVE 
THAT'S A NICE SURPRISE 
WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT THIS A REALLY MEMORABLE EPISODE 
I THINK YOU'VE BEEN THE WORST PROPERTY GUESSERS WE'VE EVER HAD ON THE SHOW 
ISN'T THAT GREAT WE LOVE THAT 
IF WE WERE THE BEST WOULD YOU HAVE TOLD US NO NO NEVER 
THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF 
CARROT AND STICK O. K. SO YOU'VE EXPERIENCED ALL THE HOUSES 
SOAK IT ALL UP GO AWAY 
AND MAKE THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION OF YOUR LIVES 
WHICH ONE YOU WISH TO TEST DRIVE 
DON'T TELL US NOW COS YOU CAN'T RUSH AT THIS O. K. 
GO ON GET OUT OF THE WIND IT'S PRETTY CHILLY 
RIGHT WHILE I GO OFF AND RUN ROUND THE FIELD ONCE AGAIN 
O. K. HERE IS A QUICK RECAP FOR YOU AT HOME 
OUR FIRST STOP WAS MY CHOICE 
THE PERFECTLY FORMED AND IMMACULATELY PRESENTED FAMILY HOME 
ON THE MARKET FOR SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
OUR SECOND OFFERING WAS MY CHIC AND STYLISH HOUSE CLOSE TO THE CENTRE OF STRATFORD 
OFFERING CONTEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION A LARGE GARDEN INCLUDING AN ORCHARD 
STRETCHING THE BUDGET THOUGH 
AT SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND THEN THERE WAS THE WILD CARD 
NESTLING AMONGST THE FIELDS OF NEWBOLD ON STOUR 
THREE STOREYS OF FABULOUS FAMILY LIVING UP FOR GRABS 
ALL AT A BARGAIN PRICE OF FIVE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WELL AFTER THE EMOTION OF THE DAY LEANNE AND MARK 
YOU HAVE ONLY GONE AND AGAINST ALL THE ODDS 
CHOSEN TO TEST DRIVE KRISTIAN'S CHOICE 
THAT'S NOT TRUE IS IT ED 
DO YOU WANT TO SAY WHOSE HOUSE THEY'LL TEST DRIVE 
YOU'VE GONE FOR EDWARD'S CHOICE AND I DON'T BLAME YOU 
THEY WERE ALL GREAT HOUSES BUT THIS IS ALSO A VERY LOVELY HOUSE 
WHY DID YOU GO FOR MY PROPERTY 
WELL I THINK WE LIKED THE SIZE OF THE GARDEN THE PLOT IT'S IN 
WE ALSO LIKED THE 
ER THE VIEW OF THE BUILDING FROM THE OUTSIDE 
AND INSIDE WE FEEL THAT WE CAN 
POSSIBLY MOVE THE BEDROOMS AROUND A LITTLE BIT 
MOVE THE WALLS AROUND 
AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE LIKE IT 
AND WE THINK IT HAS POTENTIAL AS WELL 
IT'S A VERY GRAND AND IMPOSING HOUSE I'M NOT GOING TO RESPOND TO YOU AT ALL EDWARD 
WE'VE HAD THE TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY PROPERTY SURVEYOR GIVE IT A THOROUGH GOING OVER 
IT'S NOT LEGALLY BINDING BUT HE DID FIND SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT 
IT'S A BRILLIANT HOUSE 
HE SAID MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT YOUR ARCHITECT'S CERTIFICATES 
AND YOUR BUILDING'S CERTIFICATES AND IT'S A GREAT HOUSE 
THE LOCATION'S GOOD IT'S CLOSE TO STRATFORD 
AND OBVIOUSLY WITH CHILDREN WE NEED TO BE NEAR THE 
I THINK WE ALL DO LOVE THIS HOUSE 
WE DO YES I LOVE THIS HOUSE AS WELL 
BUT ME AND THE PROPERTY HUNTING TEAM FOUND IT DON'T FORGET 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH EDWARD 
ARE YOU STILL HERE I'M STILL HERE 
GO IN ENJOY THE TEST DRIVE IT'S SUPER I'D LOVE TO COME IN WITH YOU 
IT'S AH 
THANKS ED WE'LL SEE YOU LATER 
GO AND HIDE ANYWHERE YOU LIKE AND I'LL COME AND FIND YOU 
THE COUNTDOWN STARTS NOW READY STEADY GO 
OH I LOVE A GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED WHERE'S DIGBY 
YES I HAVE WELL HURRY UP AND HIDE BECAUSE HERE I COME 
AND IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE FREYA WILL BE RUNNING AROUND TOO 
SHAME SHE CAN'T PLAY SHE'S SO SMALL SHE'D BE BRILLIANT AT IT 
THAT'S STRANGE I CAN SEE AN EXERCISE BALL AND BEANBAG TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND TWO CHILDREN 
AND AS MUCH AS I LOVE HIDE AND SEEK 
IT DOES MAKE ME VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE A CHILD FONDLING A FINE WINDOW TREATMENT 
SO AS WE LOOK OUT ONTO THAT AMAZING GARDEN WITH THE ORCHARD AT THE END 
AS WE SIT IN THE SUMPTUOUS SURROUNDINGS OF THIS LOUNGE 
AND THE GLORIES OF THAT AMAZING OPEN PLAN KITCHEN 
IT SEEMS LUDICROUS FOR ME TO ASK IF YOU STILL LIKE THE HOUSE 
WE DO LIKE THE HOUSE AND WE THINK IT'S GOT A GREAT FAMILY FEEL TO IT 
LET'S JUST RECAP AGAIN WHY YOU PICKED IT 
YEAH I MEAN THE ACTUAL INTERIOR IS A LITTLE BIT MORE MODERN 
THE FIRST HOUSE WAS LOVELY AND I'M SURE SOMEBODY WOULD BE REALLY HAPPY THERE 
BUT WE LIKE THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF THE GARDEN 
WE LIKE THE PLACE BECAUSE OF THE DECOR 
WE LIKE THE PLACE BECAUSE WE THINK WE CAN DO THINGS WITH IT 
THAT WILL SUIT OUR FAMILY 
LET'S DELAY THIS NO LONGER 
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY THAT'S THE IMPORTANT QUESTION 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO ALSO HAVE A LOOK AT THE WILD CARD PROPERTY 
JUST TO THROW THAT ONE INTO THE MIX CONTROVERSIAL 
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH GOOD VALUE 
IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY AND IT'S BEEN LOVELY TO MEET YOU BOTH 
THANK YOU ED YOU'VE BEEN BRILLIANT KRISTIAN I THINK YOU'VE BEEN MEDIOCRE 
THANK YOU VE AS ALWAYS 
OH DEAR 
SHALL WE GO SHALL WE 
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S BEEN LOVELY 
IT'S THE BEST NEWS IT'S THE BEST NEWS I'VE EVER HEARD 
THEY LOVE PROPERTY TWO AND THREE 
IN A GOOD MOOD ABOUT THAT I WAS QUITE PLEASED 
GOOD I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE EMBRACED THE PAIN THAT YOU'VE GONE THROUGH 
IT'S ALL FAKE I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PUMMELLED TO DEATH BY ALL THREE OF YOU 
BUT IT'S FINE COS THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER CHANCE
