AS THOUSANDS MORE FACE DEATH 
OUTRAGE AS THE BURMESE JUNTA BLOCKS 
AID FROM GETTING THROUGH 
TONIGHT THEY'RE LETTING FOOD ROT 
WHILST THEIR PEOPLE STARVE 
DESPERATELY NEEDED AID STOPPED AT 
THE DOOR BUT IF YOU TURN ON STATE 
TELEVISION THIS IS THE MESSAGE ITS 
PEOPLE SEE HOUSE REPOSSESSIONS ARE 
UP BY NEARLY A FIFTH ARE WE FACING 
A DEBT CRISIS 
I HAVE THE SECOND 
BEST JOB IN GOVERNMENT IN AMERICA 
AND MAYBE THE WORLD 
WE ASK THE 
MAYOR OF NEW YORK ABOUT BORIS 
BUSINESS AND WHO HE WOULD LIKE IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
WEST BEIRUT 
IS 
TAKEN 
HEZBOLLAH WHAT COULD 
THIS MEAN FOR THE MIDDLE EAST AND 
ON NEWSNIGHT REVIEW AT 
ELEVEN P. M. I 
AM 
JOINED BY MARK KERMODE BIDISHA AND 
RICHARD COLES THE MAN WHO ATE HIS 
WAY TO A HIT WITH SUPERSIZE ME GOES

CONTRIBUTES TO A SHOW ABOUT BRITISH 
ART 
THE ACES WHAT THE BRITISH ART PEOPLE ARE LIKE 
A PRECOCIOUS 
TALENT BEIJING COMA A DEVASTATING 
STORY ABOUT TIANANMEN SQUARE 
GOOD EVENING ANYONE SANE AND HALF 
HUMAN WOULD STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND 
THE LATEST ACTIONS OF THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT THE NUMBER OF DEAD 
COULD REACH ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SAY THE UN BUT 
WHEN FOOD AID ARRIVED IN THE 
COUNTRY TODAY MILITARY OFFICIALS 
IN RANGOON IMPOUNDED IT TONIGHT 
WITH THE HELP OF BURMESE INSIDERS 
WE DELVE 
INTO THE 
MINDS OF 
THOSE IN 
POWER 
AND TRY 
TO UNDERSTAND 
WOULD MAKE A 
REGIME DENY 
ITS OWN 
PEOPLE 
THE CHANCE 
OF SURVIVAL ON 
SUCH A MASSIVE SCALE VIEWERS MAY 
FIND SOME PICTURES IN LIZ MACKEAN'S 
REPORTS DISTURBING THE AFTERMATH 
OF A DISASTER FIELDS UNDER WATER 
BODIES ADRIFT UNKNOWN MASSES 
PERISHED WHEN CYCLONE NARGIS FLUNG 
A WALL OF SEA WATER ONTO THE 
IRAWADDY DELTA THOSE THAT 
FACE A SECOND CALAMITY THE RISK 
OF DISEASE RISES WITH EACH PASSING 
DAY AID AGENCIES SAY THAT WATER 
PURIFICATION IS AN URGENT PRIORITY 
SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. OF 
THEIR STRUGGLE 
A WEEK ON THE COUNTRY'S VAST ARMY 
IS FINALLY MOBILISING TO UNLOAD 
SUPPLY CLAIMS THE OFFICIAL 
RESPONSE DOES NOT BEGIN TO MATCH 
THE NEED IT IS ESTIMATED AT ONLY 
ONE IN TEN PEOPLE WHO NEEDS HELP IS 
GETTING IT THEY APPEAL FOR FOREIGN 
AID BUT THE AUTHORITIES ARE 
RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT IT TODAY THE 
UN'S WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME 
TEMPORARILY HALTED RELIEF FLIGHTS 
AFTER TWO OF ITS PLANES WERE POUND 
DID ON ARRIVAL 
WE ARE VERY 
CONCERNED POUNDED OUR FOOD HAS 
NOT BEEN RELEASED BE WORST CASE 
SCENARIO IS ESSENTIALLY FIFTEEN 
MILLION PEOPLE ARE AT RISK AND 
CHOLERA BIGGINS WAS THAT YOU HAVE A 
MASSIVE DEATH TOLL 
IT IS NORMALLY 
AFTER THE TENTH DAY THAT THE DEATH 
TOLL STARTS RISING EXPONENTIALLY 
THERE ARE FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE NOT BEEN REACHED BY EIGHT 
SUPPLIES AND YET THIS IS THE 
IMAGE OF THEIR COUNTRY THAT THE 
BURMESE GUERRILLAS ARE PROMOTING ON 
STATE TELEVISION RULERS MANY 
SEE THE REFERENDUM AS A MEANS FOR 
MILITARY RULERS TO KEEP THEIR GRIP 
ON POWER FROM ITS REMOTE 
STRONGHOLD THE REGIME POUNCES ON 
ANY DISSENT BUT WITH ITS COUNTRY 
IN CRISIS IT SEEMS IT SEEMS 
UNABLE TO ACT IT IS A DILEMMA HOW 
DO YOU HELP PEOPLE WHEN LEADERS ARE 
SO SUSPICIOUS THEY MAY WANT THE 
EIGHT BUT THE GENERALS DO NOT WANT 
THE WORKERS THEY ARE SEEN AS AN 
ADVANCED GUARD A TROJAN HORSE 
THAT MIGHT ALLOW AN INVADING ARMY 
INTO THE COUNTRY OR STOKE INTERNAL 
OPPOSITION CRITICS BELIEVE ANXIETY 
FOR ITS OWN FEATURE WILL PROLONG 
THE CURRENT EMERGENCY FUTURE 
THE FASTEST WAY TO GET EIGHT TO 
WHERE IT IS NEEDED IS BY AIR BY 
HELICOPTER THAT WOULD MEAN OPENING 
UP FORTRESS BURMA TO THE AID 
AGENCIES AND RISK BEING SHOWN UP BY 
THE WEST 
IF THEY ACCEPT THE 
FOREIGN ORGANISATIONS TO COME AND 
WORK INSIDE BURMA THESE 
ORGANISATIONS WILL DO SOME KIND OF 
SPYING ON BURMA AND TRY TO AGITATE 
SOME POLITICAL ORGANISATIONS 
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT THESE ARE 
THE FEELINGS THEY HAVE THIS IS WHY 
THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT THE 
ORGANISATIONS COMING INTO BURMA 
FRANCE HAS LED CALLS FOR AID TO BE 
A DROPPED UNDER THE UN PRINCIPLE 
TO PROTECT LIVES AIR 
I THINK IT 
IS IMPRACTICAL THIS MAY BE IN 
AREAS WHERE IT CANNOT BE REACHED OR 
WHERE THE ARMY CAN TAKE IT AND USE 
IT FOR ITS OWN DEVICES OR IN AREAS 
WHICH ARE ACTUALLY FAR REMOVED FROM 
THE AREAS OF MOST NEED THIS IS 
VERY WASTEFUL AND NOT APPROPRIATE 
THE SECOND IS THAT IF IT IS DONE 
IN THAT MANNER IT WILL BE DEEMED 
TO HAVE BREACHED BURMESE 
SOVEREIGNTY 
THOSE WHO KNOW THE SOVEREIGNTY COUNTRY WELL SAY ALL IS NOT LAST 
THERE ARE GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES 
ALSO PROFESSIONAL AND IDEOLOGICAL 
DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE INNER CIRCLE 
IF THE YOUNGER GENERATION GENERALS 
WHO I WOULD PRESUME WANT TO ENGAGE 
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN A 
RESPECTABLE ALL RESPECTABLE MANNER 
IF THEY PREVAIL WE'RE GOING TO SEE 
SOME OPENING UP 
THE FRUSTRATION IS 
MOUNTING OFFICERS THAT OFFICES 
SAID IT ISSUE VISAS ARE CLOSED FOR 
A THREE DAY HOLIDAY ALL THE WHILE 
BURMA'S STRICKEN PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO 
SURVIVE JUST BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR 
I SPOKE WITH SIR JOHN HOLMES THE 
UN UNDER SECRETARY GENERAL FOR 
HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS AND ASKED WHAT HAD HAPPENED 
TO THE 
FOOD AID 
THAT HAD BEEN DELIVERED TODAY 
I DO 
NOT KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT 
NOW DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING ON IN A 
CONSTRUCTIVE SPIRIT 
YOU HAVE 
RESUMED FLIGHTS OF FOOD AID FOR 
TOMORROW WHAT HAS ACTUALLY BE 
NEGOTIATED 
THE POINT WAS THAT THE NEGOTIATED WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME HE WERE 
RATHER INCENSED BY THE DIFFICULTIES 
THEY WERE HAVING SAYING THEY WOULD 
HAVE TO POSTPONE FLIGHTS UNTIL IT 
WILL BE AGREED ARE NOW SAYING THEY 
WILL RESUME FLIGHTS WE CANNOT 
SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ARGUING L. HOPE 
THAT WILL BE RESOLVED VERY QUICKLY 
PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE FOUND 
WE CANNOT AFFORD EITHER SIDE TO BE 
STANDING ON PRINCIPLE WHILE PEOPLE 
ARE AT RISK OF DYING DOWN IN THE 
DELTA IT WILL BE DIFFICULT ENOUGH 
TO GET THE EIGHT TO THEM IN THE 
FIRST PLACE 
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE 
GENTLE SAID THEY TOOK CONTROL TO 
DELIVER IT WITHOUT DELAY WOULD 
THAT BE POSSIBLE JO AND HER 
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO HAVE A ROLE IN 
DELIVERING IT GOVERNMENTS AND THE 
MILITARY SOMETIMES DELIVER AID IN 
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES MEDICAL 
SUPPLIES ARE BEING TRAVEL 
CHANNELLED THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF 
HEALTH THERE IS NOT A BLANKET BAN 
ON GOVERNMENT DELIVERING AID WE 
HAVE TO HAVE ANY REASONABLE 
ASSURANCE THAT WE KNOW WHERE IT IS 
GOING WE CAN MONITOR WHAT IS 
HAPPENING TO IT THAT IS WHAT IS 
UNDER DISCUSSION AM CONFIDENT WE 
CAN REACH PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS 
FAIRLY QUICKLY 
THIS IS A NERVOUS 
REGIME DO YOU HAVE REAL FACE WHEN 
YOU SAY REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT 
THEY CAN HANDLE THIS ONE STAY 
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT WE 
WANT FROM THE AUSTERITIES IS FORT 
AND FLEXIBLE CO OPERATION FALL 
THEY MUST ALLOW EXPERIENCED WORKERS 
TO HELP IT IS OBVIOUS TO EVERYBODY 
THAT THIS IS A NERVOUS AND 
SUSPICIOUS GOVERNMENT COME UP WITH 
POLITICAL WORRIES WHICH ONE CAN 
UNDERSTAND BUT WHICH SHOULD NOT BE 
ALLOWED TO GET IN THE WAY OF 
DELIVERING EIGHT THEY DID NOT HAVE 
THE BEST PREPARED SYSTEM EVER THAT 
IS WHY THEY NEED MORE HELP TO GET 
IT DOWN THERE 
IT HAS 
TO 
BE A 
CO 
OPERATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE 
GOVERNMENT THE MILITARY AND THE 
OUTSIDE AGENCIES AND OF COURSE 
COUNTRIES ARE DELIVERING EIGHT 
BILATERALLY 
IS THERE ANY CONDITION BILATERALLY UNDER WHICH WE YOU WOULD CONSIDER 
A DROP 
THERE MIGHT BE CONDITIONS 
IT IS A LAST RESORT IT IS NOT HAVE 
A GOOD WAY OF DOING THIS IT IS 
HARD TO KNOW WHETHER THIS IS 
GETTING IN THE RIGHT PLACE IF THIS 
IS DONE AGAINST THE RITZ THE 
WISHES OF THE GOVERNMENT THE RISKS 
OF THAT ART OF FIERCE WE ARE 
LOOKING FOR CO OPERATION ARE 
OBVIOUS THE LOGISTICS PROBLEMS OF 
DELIVERING THE AID TO PEOPLE IN THE 
DELTA ONE ENORMOUS WE CANNOT AFFORD 
TO WASTE TIME ARE ENORMOUS L. 
WAS ENCOURAGED TODAY BY THE FACT 
THAT THE AUTHORITIES SAID THAT THEY 
WELCOMED AID FROM ANY QUARTER AND 
THEY WERE GOING TO ALLOW A U. S. PLANE 
IN ON MONDAY THAT IS A FIRST STEP 
BUT A WELCOME FIRST STEP 
YOU ARE 
PUTTING OUT THE APPEAL FOR PEOPLE 
TO RESPOND AND DONATE MONEY IT IS 
BEING PLAYED OUT IN EVERY STATION 
PEOPLE WILL STILL FEEL IT IS A 
SHEER WASTE OF MONEY WHAT WOULD 
YOU TELL THEM 
I DO NOT THINK THAT 
IS THE CASE THE MONEY WILL GO TO 
AGENCIES AND NGAS THEY WILL MAKE 
SURE REACHES THE PEOPLE IT IS 
INTENDED FOR THAT IS THROUGH 
WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
HUMANITARIAN AID IS VERY RARELY 
DIVERTED OR MANIPULATED BECAUSE IT 
USUALLY GETS TO THOSE WHO NEED IT 
THERE IS A DESPERATE NEED OF THE 
PEOPLE DOWN IN THE DELTA WHO ARE AT 
RISK OF EPIDEMICS AND LACKING FOOD 
AND CLEAN WATER AND MEDICAL 
SUPPLIES THEY REALLY NEED IT L. 
WOULD URGE GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT 
IT 
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE MONEY THERE 
ARE FULL DETAILS ON HOW TO 
CONTRIBUTE ON THE B. B. C. WEBSITE 
COULD BRITAIN BE FACING ITS WORST 
DEBT CRISIS SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETY'S HOUSE 
REPOSSESSIONS ARE UP BY MORE THAN 
SEVENTEEN PER CENT ON THIS TIME LAST YEAR AND AN 
INCREASING NUMBER OF HOMEOWNERS 
COULD BE FACING NEGATIVE EQUITY 
ALL THE SIGNS OF OVERBORROWING HAVE 
BEEN THERE FOR LONG TIME SHOULD 
WE HAVE SEEN THIS COMING 
THEY LENT YOU THE MONEY YOU CAN'T 
MAKE YOUR PAYMENTS AND THEY WANT 
THE KEYS TO YOUR HOUSE 
A WHOLE DEMU NEW GENERATION IS 
FINDING OUT THAT PROPERTY IS NEVER 
A ONE WAY BET AND MORTGAGE LENDERS 
CAN BE ROUGH AS WELL AS SMOOTH 
TODAY'S FIGURES ARE BAD UP SEVENTEEN PER CENT 
THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND THE 
PREDICKS ARE WORSE INCREASING 
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE CAN'T COPE WITH 
THEIR MORTGAGE BILLS BECAUSE THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH HAS MOVED FROM THE 
WORLD OF BANKING INTO THE WORLD OF 
BRICKS AND MORTAR THERE WERE 
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED REPOSSESSION ORDERS MADE IN 
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED REPOSSESSION ORDERS MADE IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS SEVENTEEN PER CENT UP FROM 
THIS TIME LAST YEAR NOT ALL ORDERS 
LED TO REPOSSESSION THE COUNCIL OF 
MORTGAGE LENDERS REDICTS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
HOMES WILL BE SEIZED YEAR COMPARED 
TO TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND LAST YEAR A RISE OF OVER 
TWO THIRDS 
TO TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND LAST YEAR A RISE OF OVER TWO THIRDS IT'S PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SEVERAL 
CERTIFICATION OR SUB PRIME 
MORTGAGES HO ARE STRUGGLING MOST 
HEAVILY AT THE MOMENT THAT'S WHERE 
REPOSSESSIONS HAVE BEEN 
CONCENTRATED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY'S THERE 
WASN'T A SUB PRIME MORTGAGE MARKET 
IN THE U. K. WE'RE SEEING SHARPER 
PICK ARE PICK UP IN REPOSSESSIONS 
INDICATIVE OF LENDERS TAKING 
EARLIER ACTION TO DEAL WITH 
DEFAULTING BORROWERS WE KNOW WHO 
IS SUFFERING THE NEXT QUESTION IS 
WHERE OR WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 
REGIONAL BREAKDOWN THERE'S A 
STARTLING CORRELATION BETWEEN 
RISING REPOSSESSION AND FALLING 
HOUSE PRICES CLAIMS FOR 
REPOSSESSION IN LONDON WERE 
ACTUALLY DOWN ONE PER CENT UP TWENTY THREE PER CENT IN THE 
WEST MIDLANDS UP THIRTY TWO PER CENT IN LING 
UP THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT IN WEST WALES AND A 
STAGGERING FORTY FOUR PER CENT IN NORTH WALES 
LINCOLNSHIRE HOUSE PRICES ARE 
STILL RISING IN LONDON BUT THEY 
HAVE FALLEN IN WEST MIDLANDS 
LINCOLNSHIRE AND ACROSS WALES AS 
WHOLE IF YOU DRILL DOWN INTO THE 
FIGURES SOMETHING ELSE HITS YOU 
REPOSSESSION CLAIMS ARE UP ELEVEN PER CENT IN 
SLOF BRING AND NINETY ONE PER CENT IN 
HAVERFORDWEST ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN PER CENT IN SPLUES 
BRING THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT WE 
ARE SEEING NOW ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
DESPERATELY TRIED TO GET INTO HOME 
QUITE RESPONSIBLY THEY 
OWNERSHIP QUITE RESPONSIBLY THEY ARE USUALLY IN PERFECTLY GOOD 
EMPLOYMENT AND THEY HAVE WANTED A 
SHARE OF THE STABILITY AND HOUSING 
WEALTH THAT WE ALL OF US HAVE 
SHARE HOWEVER IT HAS GONE WRONG 
FOR THEM THEY MAY HAVE HAD A 
PERSONAL TRAGEDY IN THEIR LIFE 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP MAY HAVE BROKE 
UP OR GOT SICK OR LOST THEIR JOBS 
OR REBORROWED AT THE AT THE WRONG 
TIME IN NINETEEN NINETY FLOOD OF EMPTY 
HOMES DROVE PRICES INTO DOWNWARD 
SPIRAL THERE'S DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN NOW AND THE NINETEEN NINETY'S WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN JOB LOSSES YET THIS THIS TIME IT ISN'T JOB LOSSES BEHIND THE 
RISE BUT THE CREDIT SQUEEZE 
LEAVING PEOPLE WITH INCREASES IN 
THE MORTGAGE COSTS AND MEANING THEY 
ARE ENABLE TO REFINANCE WHEN A 
DISCOUNCILLED OR FIXED RATE COMES 
TO DEBT 
TODAY THE GOVERNMENT PUT 
AN EXTRA TEN MILLION INTO DEBT 
SERVICES AND IT PUBLICLY LENT TO 
THE COMPANIES TO ENSURE THAT 
REPOSSESSION IS ONLY A LAST RESORT 
PART IS SAYING YOU'RE ASSURING US 
YOU WANT TO STOP PEOPLE HAVING 
THEIR HOMES REPOSSESSIONED SHOW US 
THROUGH THE BEST PRACTICES HOW WE 
CAN STOP THAT HAPPENING WE'RE 
WORKING WITH THEM JOINTLY TO SEE 
HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE 
SERVICES AVAILABLE TO HELP PEOPLE 
ARE HAPPENING ON REGULAR BASIS 
ACROSS THE SECTOR THAT'S HOW WE'RE 
PUTTING PRESSURE ON 
WHAT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE TODAY IS A STEP 
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THEY 
NEED TO GO MUCH FURTHER AS WELL AS 
PUTTING IN PLACE SERVICES FOR 
PEOPLE AT A POINT OF CRISIS WHEN 
THEY END UP IN COURT THEY NEED TO 
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS 
TO HELP AND SUPPORT EARLIER ON WHEN 
THEY FIRST GET INTO TROUBLE THAT 
MEANS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE 
AVAILABILITY OF ADVICE AND DEBT 
COUNSELLING FOR PEOPLE EARLIER IN 
THE PROCESS THEY NEED TO BE MAKING 
IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR 
LESSONERS TO GET REPOSSESSIONS 
EARLY 
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM EARLY MANY OF THE COMPANIES DEMANDING 
REPOSSESSION ARE HIGH RISK 
LESSONERS AND THEY ARE LOOKING CASH 
STRAPPED THEMSELVES SO MANY MORE 
PEOPLE HIGH RISK LENDERS AND 
THEY ARE LOOKING CASH STRAPPED 
THEMSELVES MANY MORE PEOPLE MAY 
LOSE THEIR HOMES 
WHENEVER SOMEONE RULES THEMSELVES 
OUT OF A TOP JOB IN POLITICS YOU 
CAN SURE THEY ARE INTERESTED THE 
MAYOR IN NEW YORK WAS IN LONDON 
OFFERING ADVICE TO BORIS JOHNSON 
HE CAN PROUDLY CLAIM TO BEING A 
DEMOCRAT AND A REPUBLICAN BEFORE 
BECOMING AN INDEPENDENT THAT PUTS 
HIM IN AN GOOD POSITION FOR THE 
LAST SEVEN YEARS MICHAEL BLOOMBERG 
HAS RUN ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL 
CITIES IN THE WORLD AND HAS IN 
RECENT TIMES HAD POLL RATINGS ONLY 
GEORGE BUSH COULD DREAM OF THE 
FOUNDER OF THE BLOOMBERG FINANCIAL 
NEWS IMPEER IS A EMPIRE IS A 
POLITICAL MAVERICK A LIFELONG 
DEMOCRAT WHO SWITCHED TO THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY IN ORDER TO FIGHT 
FOR REELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AND LAST HE 
PARTED WAYS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
AND DECLARED HIMSELF A AN 
INDEPENDENT MAYOR BLOOMBERG HAS IN 
HIS WORDS THE BEST JOB IN POLITICS 
MAYBE THE SECOND BEST HE LATER 
QUALIFIED HE WAS FREQUENTLY TALKED 
ABOUT AS CANDIDATES FOR THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS TIPPED AS 
THE MAN WHO WOULD BE A BILLION 
DOLLARS CAMPAIGNER IN FEBRUARY HE PUT AN 
END TO THE SPECULATION SAYING HE 
WOULD NOT RUN FOR THE TOP JOB HIS 
BACKING HAS BEEN SOUGHT THERE'S 
ROLE OF TAKING ON THE JOB OF VICE 
PRESIDENT FOR EITHER THE 
REPUBLICANS OR THE DEMOCRATS NEW 
YORK HAS SEEN IMPROVEMENTS IN 
SCHOOL RESULTS AND INCREASED 
REDUCTION OF THE OF THE CRIME RATE 
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG IS IN LONDON TO 
OFFER SUPPORT TO BORIS JOHNSON 
ADVISING HIM HOW TO RUN ONE OF THE 
LARGEST CITIES IN THE WORLD 
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG WHO TOOK OVER NEW 
YORK FROM RUDY GIULIANI KNOWS WHAT 
IT IS LIKE TO FOLLOW A MAYOR WHO 
HAS LEFT HIS MARK L. ASKED HIM WHAT 
ADVICE HE HAD GIVEN BORIS TO AVOID 
THE EARLY PIT FALLS 
I THINK YOU 
HAVE TO BE YOURSELF YOU CAN'T BE 
YOUR PRAED SESOR AND YOUR 
SUCCESSOR PEOPLE RESPECT 
GENUINENESS BORIS IS BORIS HE HAS 
HIS LOOK AND TEMPERAMENT AND WAYS 
OF PRESENTING THINGS AND HIS OWN 
VIEWS THAT'S WHAT HE SHOULD FOCUS 
ON AND NOT TRY TO OUTDO ANYTHING 
THAT HIS PREDECESSOR DID OR 
BEHAVIOUR IN A WAY THAT HIS 
PREDECESSOR DID JUST BECAUSE HE 
THINKS THAT'S WHAT THE PUBLIC WANT 
THE PUBLIC WANTS A CHANGE AND THE 
PUBLIC VOTED FOR BORIS JOHNSON AND 
BORIS JOHNSON SHOULD DELIVER WHAT 
HE THEY VOTED FOR 
THIS IS A 
DIFFERENT SITUATION 
THE FACT BORIS 
IS IN ONE PARTY AND THE OTHER PARTY 
IS IN POWER AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL 
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT REALLY STOPS 
ANYTHING IN THE END GORDON BROWN 
AND HIS GOVERNMENT SHOULD WANT TO 
WORK WITH BORIS JOHNSON THEY DON'T 
VA HAVE ANY INTEREST IN AN TAG 
NIEDSING THE PEOPLE OF LONDON AND 
HAVING THE PEOPLE OF LONDON LESS 
HAPPY THAN THEY ARE TODAY IF IF ANYTHING IS MAKING THE JOB OF 
GOVERNMENT MORE DIFFICULT THESE 
DAYS IT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN 
THE ECONOMY THE U. S. RECESSION EASY EASY TO GOVERN WHEN YOU HAVE REVENUES TO 
GIVE EVERYBODY 
HOW BAD DO YOU 
THINK IT WILL GET AND HOW LONG IT 
WILL LAST 
NOBODY CAN ANSWER EITHER 
OF THE QUESTIONS OTHER THAN THE 
CONTEXT GEOGRAPHY PLAYS A BIG PART 
OF IT THE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
WHERE THEY HAVE A LOT OF 
SPECULATIVE HOUSING AND SECONDARY 
VAI CASE HOUSES OBVIOUSLY HURT A 
LOT MORE LIKE UNLIKE NEW YORK 
WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HOMES THEY 
LIVE IN IT WILL HURT EVERYBODY 
NEW YORK CITY'S PROBLEM LIKE 
LONDON'S IS THE FINANCIAL SERVICES 
INDUSTRY IS HAVING A COLLAPSE OF 
THEIR PROFITS SO THE TAX REVENUES 
THAT LONDON AND NEW YORK GET AND 
THE JOBS THAT THESE THOSE 
COMPANIES CREATE WILL BE LESS 
THERE WILL BE BIG PROBLEMS 
DO YOU 
THINK IN TWO YEARS' TIME I WILL 
STILL BE ASKING YOU ABOUT THE U. S. 
RECESSION 
MY SUSPICION IS NOT AND RECESSION MY HOPE IS NOT IF YOU ASKED ME IN 
SIX MONTHS THERE WILL STILL BE THE 
SAME QUESTION AND IN A YEAR THERE 
WOULD PROBABLY BE WE HAVE GONE 
THROUGH FIVE OR TEN YEARS OF 
NOTHING BUT GOOD TIMES THINGS 
ALWAYS GOT BETTER EVEN WHEN WE HAD 
THE INTERNET BUBBLE AND SEPTEMBER 
ELEVEN WE RECOVERED RELATIVELY QUICKLY 
FROM BOTH 
I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE U. S. 
POLITICAL SCENE IT HAS BEEN A BIG 
WEEK IS IT TIME FOR HILLARY TO 
STEP DOWN 
IT IS HER DECISION 
HILLARY CLINTON HAS 
IN YOUR 
OPINION YOU HAVE SEEN IT FROM THE 
PERSPECTIVE OF A DEMOCRAT AND A 
REPUBLICAN 
YEAH I HAVE BEEN REPUBLICAN EVERYTHING IF YOU PUT YOURSELF IN 
HILLARY CLINTON'S HEAD HILLARY 
CLINTON HAS A DREAM AMERICA IS A 
COUNTRY OF DREAMS SHE WANTS TO BE 
PRESIDENT 
IS SHE RISKING THE PRESIDENT DEMOCRATIC DREAM FOR THE REST OF 
THE COUNTRY 
NO NO ABSOLUTELY NOT 
I DON'T SUB SCRIBE TO THIS YOU'RE 
HELPING MCCAIN BY HAVING A FIGHT 
THE CONTRARY YOU'RE BATTLE TESTING 
THE CANDIDATES ON THE DEMOCRATIC 
SIDE YOU'RE GETTING THE BAD NEWS 
OUT AND YOU THEY STILL SURVIVE 
AND JOHN MCCAIN IS NOT IN THE NEWS 
EVERY DAY CONVENTIONAL WIS DOM IS 
OPPOSITE BUT CONVENTIONAL WIS DOM 
IS WRONG 
YOU KNOW ALL THE 
CANDIDATES PRETTY WELL HAVE YOU 
BEEN ASKED TO WORK FOR ANY OF THEM 
I THINK I HAVE CONTACT WITH THEM 
ALL OF THEM JOHN MCCAIN CAMPAIGNED 
FOR ME IN TWO THOUSAND ONE I'VE INTRODUCED HIM 
AT EVENTS I'VE INTRODUCED OBAMA AT 
EVENTS I TALK TO HILLARY CLINTON 
FREQUENTLY BECAUSE SHE'S SENIOR 
SENATOR IN STATE IF I NEED 
SOMETHING IN WASHINGTON HILLARY 
CLINTON IS ALWAYS RESPONSIVE 
INSTANTLY RESPONSIVE 
WOULD YOU BE 
PREPARED TO BE HER RUNNING MATE 
NOBODY IS GOING TO ASK ME TO BE 
RUNNING MATE 
YOU ONCE SAID WHO IS 
GOING TO VOTE FOR A SHORT JEW WITH 
A DIVORCE 
I WAS TALKING ABOUT 
SOMEBODY ELSE 
DO YOU THINK BARACK 
OBAMA BARACK OBAMA PEOPLE WILL 
VOTE FOR BARACK OBAMA BARACK OBAMA 
THERE'S A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE 
WHO ARE RACIST AND WON'T VOTE FOR A 
BLACK AND THERE'S A HANDFUL OF 
PEOPLE WHO ARE RACIST AND WON'T 
VOTE FOR A WOMEN IF BARACK OBAMA 
DIDN'T WIN IT WOULD BE BECAUSE HE 
COULDN'T PROVE HOW HE COULD LEAD 
THE COUNTRY AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS 
OF OIL DEPENDENCY AND THE 
PROBLEMS AMERICA HAS A IMAGE 
PROBLEM 
SEVENTEEN PER CENT IN FOREIGN TOURISM IN PROBLEM AMERICA THIS YEAR NINE PER CENT IN INCREASE 
IN FOREIGN TOURISM TO NEW YORK CITY 
IT IS VERY LOCAL IN NEW YORK CITY 
BUT AMERICA HAS A IMAGE PROBLEM 
YOU TALKED ABOUT BORIS BEING 
HIMSELF AND YOU MET HIM AGAIN AS 
MAYOR 
I FEEL BETTER WITH SOMEBODY MAYOR LIKE HIM L. DON'T THINK IF HE HAS 
SKHAINGED HE HAS TO CHANGE ANY MORE 
HE HAS GOT TO BE MORE SERIOUS HE 
HAS NOW GOTTEN THE JOB HE'S 
CAMPAIGNING IT IS EASY TO SUGGEST 
SOLUTIONS NOW IT HAS TO DELIVER 
IT'S NOT EASY IF IT WAS EASY IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE 
TODAY'S OTHER 
NEWS AFTER THREE DAYS OF INTENSE 
FIGHTING IN LEBANON HEZBOLLAH HAVE

SENSE BEEN DOING IS HUMILIATING HIM
