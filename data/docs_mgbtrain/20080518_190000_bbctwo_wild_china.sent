BENEATH BILLOWING CLOUDS 
IN CHINA'S FAR SOUTHWESTERN YUNNAN PROVINCE 
LIES A PLACE OF MYSTERY AND LEGEND 
OF MIGHTY RIVERS AND SOME OF THE OLDEST JUNGLES IN THE WORLD 
HERE HIDDEN VALLEYS NURTURE STRANGE AND UNIQUE CREATURES 
AND COLOURFUL TRIBAL CULTURES 
JUNGLES ARE RARELY FOUND THIS FAR NORTH OF THE TROPICS 
SO WHY DO THEY THRIVE HERE 
AND HOW HAS THIS RUGGED LANDSCAPE COME TO HARBOUR THE GREATEST NATURAL WEALTH IN ALL CHINA 
IN THE REMOTE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF CHINA 
A CELEBRATION IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE 
DAI PEOPLE COLLECT WATER FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT FESTIVAL OF THEIR YEAR 
THE DAI CALL THEMSELVES THE PEOPLE OF THE WATER 
YUNNAN'S RIVER VALLEYS HAVE BEEN THEIR HOME FOR OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
BY BRINGING THE RIVER WATER TO THE TEMPLE 
THEY HONOUR THE TWO THINGS HOLIEST TO THEM 
BUDDHISM AND THEIR HOME 
THE DAI GIVE THANKS FOR THE RIVERS AND FERTILE LANDS WHICH HAVE NURTURED THEIR CULTURE 
THOUGH TO SOME IT MIGHT SEEM JUST AN EXCUSE FOR THE BIGGEST WATER FIGHT OF ALL TIME 
DAI LIVES ARE CHANGING AS TOWNS GET BIGGER AND MODERNISE 
BUT THE WATER SPLASHING FESTIVAL IS STILL CELEBRATED BY ALL 
THE RIVERS WHICH LIE AT THE HEART OF DAI LIFE AND CULTURE 
FLOW FROM THE DISTANT MOUNTAINS OF TIBET 
SOUTHWARD THROUGH CENTRAL YUNNAN IN GREAT PARALLEL GORGES 
THE DAI NOW LIVE IN THE BORDERS OF TROPICAL VIETNAM AND LAOS 
BUT THEIR LEGENDS TELL OF HOW THEIR ANCESTORS CAME HERE 
BY FOLLOWING THE RIVERS FROM MOUNTAIN LANDS IN THE COLD FAR NORTH 
LYING AT THE FAR EASTERN END OF THE HIMALAYAS 
THE HENGDUAN MOUNTAINS FORM YUNNAN'S NORTHERN BORDER WITH TIBET 
KAWAKARPO CROWN OF THE HENGDUAN RANGE IS A SITE OF HOLY PILGRIMAGE 
YET ITS FORMIDABLE PEAK REMAINS UNCONQUERED 
YUNNAN'S MOUNTAINS ARE REMOTE RUGGED AND INACCESSIBLE 
HERE THE AIR IS THIN AND TEMPERATURES CAN DROP BELOW MINUS FORTY DEGREES 
THIS IS HOME TO AN ANIMAL THAT'S FOUND NOWHERE ELSE ON EARTH 
THE YUNNAN SNUB NOSED MONKEY 
IT'S FOUND ONLY IN THESE FEW ISOLATED MOUNTAIN FORESTS 
NO OTHER PRIMATE LIVES AT SUCH HIGH ALTITUDES 
BUT THESE ARE TRUE SPECIALISTS 
THESE ANCIENT MOUNTAIN DWELLERS HAVE INSPIRED LEGENDS 
LOCAL LISU PEOPLE CONSIDER THEM THEIR ANCESTORS 
CALLING THEM THE WILD MEN OF THE MOUNTAINS 
DURING HEAVY SNOWFALLS EVEN THESE SPECIALISTS CANNOT FEED 
IT SEEMS A STRANGE PLACE FOR A MONKEY 
BETWEEN SNOWS THE MONKEYS WASTE NO TIME IN THEIR SEARCH FOR FOOD 
AT THIS ALTITUDE THERE ARE FEW FRUITS OR TENDER LEAVES TO EAT 
NINETY PER CENT OF THEIR DIET IS MADE UP OF THE FINE DRY WISPS OF A CURIOUS ORGANISM 
HALF FUNGUS HALF PLANT IT'S LICHEN 
HOW HAVE MONKEYS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOWLAND JUNGLE 
COME TO LIVE SUCH A REMOTE MOUNTAIN EXISTENCE 
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY REMARKABLE ANIMAL FOUND WITHIN THESE ISOLATED HIGH PEAKS 
A CHINESE RED PANDA 
SOLITARY AND QUIET IT SPENDS MUCH OF ITS TIME IN THE TREE TOPS 
DESPITE ITS NAME 
THE RED PANDA IS ONLY A VERY DISTANT RELATIVE OF THE GIANT PANDA 
IT'S ACTUALLY MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO A SKUNK 
BUT IT DOES SHARE THE GIANT PANDA'S TASTE FOR BAMBOO 
SOUTHWEST CHINA'S RED PANDAS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR VERY STRONG FACIAL MARKINGS 
WHICH DISTINGUISH THEM FROM RED PANDAS FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE HIMALAYAS 
LIKE THE MONKEYS THEY WERE ISOLATED IN THESE HIGH FORESTS 
WHEN THE MOUNTAINS QUITE LITERALLY ROSE BENEATH THEM 
IN THE GREATEST MOUNTAIN BUILDING EVENT IN RECENT GEOLOGICAL HISTORY 
OVER THE LAST THIRTY MILLION YEARS 
THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT HAS BEEN PUSHING NORTHWARDS INTO EURASIA 
ON THE BORDER BETWEEN INDIA AND TIBET 
THE ROCKS HAVE BEEN RAISED EIGHT KILOMETRES ABOVE SEA LEVEL 
CREATING THE WORLD'S HIGHEST MOUNTAIN RANGE THE HIMALAYAS 
BUT TO THE EAST 
THE ROCKS HAVE BUCKLED INTO A SERIES OF STEEP NORTH SOUTH RIDGES 
CUTTING DOWN THROUGH THE HEART OF YUNNAN 
THE PARALLEL MOUNTAINS OF THE HENGDUAN SHAN 
THESE NATURAL BARRIERS SERVE TO ISOLATE YUNNAN'S PLANTS AND ANIMALS 
IN EACH ADJACENT VALLEY 
WHILE THE HUGE TEMPERATURE RANGE BETWEEN THE SNOWY PEAKS 
AND THE WARMER SLOPES BELOW 
PROVIDES A VAST ARRAY OF CONDITIONS FOR LIFE TO THRIVE 
THROUGH SPRING 
THE HENGDUAN SLOPES STAGE ONE OF CHINA'S GREATEST NATURAL SPECTACLES 
THE FORESTS HERE ARE AMONG THE MOST DIVERSE BOTANICAL AREAS IN THE WORLD 
OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PLANT SPECIES GROW HERE 
OF WHICH THREE THOUSAND ARE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE 
UNTIL LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO THIS PLACE WAS UNKNOWN OUTSIDE CHINA 
BUT THEN NEWS REACHED THE WEST 
OF A MYSTERIOUS HIDDEN WORLD OF THE ORIENT 
HIDDEN AMONG THE MOUNTAINS A LOST SHANGRI LA PARADISE 
WESTERN HIGH SOCIETY IN THE GRIP OF A GARDENING CRAZE 
WAS EAGER FOR EXOTIC SPECIES FROM FARAWAY PLACES 
THIS GAVE RISE TO A NEW BREED OF CELEBRITY ADVENTURERS 
INTREPID BOTANIST EXPLORERS KNOWN AS THE PLANT HUNTERS 
YUNNAN BECAME THEIR HOLY GRAIL 
THE MOST FAMOUS WAS JOSEPH ROCK A REAL LIFE INDIANA JONES 
REMARKABLE FILM FOOTAGE CAPTURED HIS ENTOURAGE ON A SERIES OF EXPEDITIONS 
AS THEY PUSHED INTO THE DEEPEST CORNERS OF YUNNAN 
IN GLORIOUS COLOUR HE RECORDED THE PLANT LIFE HE FOUND 
ON SPECIAL PHOTOGRAPHIC GLASS PLATES 
SENDING THOUSANDS OF SPECIMENS BACK TO THE WEST 
THE PLANT HUNTERS CHANGED THE GARDENS OF THE WORLD FOREVER 
ROCK'S SUCCESS WAS BORN OF A MASSIVE EFFORT 
FOR TO FIND HIS SHANGRI LA 
NOT ONLY HAD HE TO TRAVERSE ENDLESS MOUNTAIN RANGES 
BUT SOME OF THE DEEPEST GORGES IN THE WORLD 
THE NUJIANG IS CALLED THE ANGRY RIVER 
THIS THREE HUNDRED KILOMETRE STRETCH OF RAGING RAPIDS 
IS AS MUCH A BARRIER TO LIFE AS ARE THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE 
BUT THE PLANT HUNTERS WEREN'T THE FIRST PEOPLE TO TRAVEL HERE 
ALONG THE NUJIANG 
LESS THAN THIRTY ROPE CROSSINGS ALLOW LOCALS PASSAGE ACROSS THE TORRENTS 
TINY HAMLETS CLING TO THE SLOPES 
THIS MORNING IT'S MARKET DAY 
DRAWING PEOPLE FROM UP AND DOWN THE VALLEY 
HANGING FROM SIMPLE ROPE SLINGS 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING THE CROSSINGS FOR MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
IN SUCH NARROW PRECIPITOUS GORGES 
IT'S BY FAR THE EASIEST WAY TO GET AROUND 
ONCE ACROSS THE STEEP SIDES MEAN IT'S STILL A HIKE 
MANY TREK FOR HOURS BY FOOT BEFORE THEY GET TO THE MARKET 
THE IMMENSE VALLEY IS HOME TO OVER A DOZEN ETHNIC GROUPS 
SOME LIKE THE NU PEOPLE ARE FOUND ONLY HERE 
THE MARKETS BRING THE MOUNTAIN TRIBES TOGETHER 
TO CONTINUE HIS EXPEDITIONS 
ROCK HAD TO GET HIS ENTIRE ENTOURAGE ACROSS THE GIANT YUNNAN RIVERS 
HE COMMISSIONED ESPECIALLY THICK ROPES MADE FROM FOREST RATTAN 
AND FILMED THE ENTIRE EVENT 
WITH YAK BUTTER TO SMOOTH THE RIDE FORTY MEN AND FIFTEEN MULES MADE THE JOURNEY 
NOT ALL MADE IT ACROSS 
ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE GREAT NUJIANG GORGE 
THE PLANT HUNTERS MADE A REMARKABLE DISCOVERY 
FAR FROM THE TROPICS 
THEY SEEMED TO BE ENTERING A STEAMY VIBRANT TROPICAL JUNGLE 
THE FOREST OF GAOLIGONGSHAN 
THE FLORA HERE IS UNLIKE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD 
NEXT TO SUBTROPICAL SPECIES ALPINE PLANTS GROW IN GIANT FORM 
CROWNING THE CANOPY RHODODENDRONS UP TO THIRTY METRES HIGH 
IN APRIL AND MAY THEIR FLOWERS TURN THE FORESTS RUBY RED 
ATTRACTING BIRD SPECIES FOUND ONLY HERE 
CONSTANT MOISTURE IN THE AIR MEANS THAT THE BRANCHES ARE LADEN WITH FLOWERING EPIPHYTES 
FIERCELY GUARDED BY TINY SUNBIRDS UNIQUE TO THESE VALLEYS 
NECTAR FEEDERS THESE ARE THE HUMMING BIRDS OF THE OLD WORLD TROPICS 
THE FORESTS OF GAOLIGONGSHAN ARE HOME TO SOME OF CHINA'S RAREST WILDLIFE 
THIS IS A FEMALE TEMMINCK'S TRAGOPAN 
SHE HAS A COLOURFUL MALE ADMIRER 
HE'S HOPING TO WOO HER WITH HIS PECULIAR PEEKABOO DISPLAY 
BUT SHE'S NOT ABOUT TO BE RUSHED 
HIS COLOURFUL SKIN WATTLE REFLECTS MORE LIGHT THAN FEATHERS DO 
TO HER THIS IS LIKE A NEON SIGN 
SEEING HIS CHANCE THE MALE MAKES HIS MOVE 
CONSTANT MOISTURE IN THE GAOLIGONGSHAN FORESTS 
MEANS THAT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THERE ARE ALWAYS FRUITS ON THE TREES 
SUCH ABUNDANCE OF FOOD ENCOURAGES A HIGH DIVERSITY OF FRUIT EATERS 
MORE COMMONLY FOUND IN THE TROPICS 
THE BLACK GIANT SQUIRREL IS FOUND ONLY IN UNDISTURBED RAINFOREST 
AT CLOSE TO A METRE IN LENGTH IT'S ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST SQUIRRELS 
THE MYSTERY IS THAT THESE FORESTS ARE GROWING WELL OUTSIDE THE TROPICS 
BY RIGHTS NONE OF THIS JUNGLE OR ITS ANIMALS SHOULD BE HERE 
THESE ARE BEAR MACAQUES 
THEY'RE FOUND ONLY IN TROPICAL AND SUB TROPICAL JUNGLE 
WITH A TINY HOME RANGE OF JUST A FEW SQUARE KILOMETRES 
THEY DEPEND ON THE ABUNDANT FRUIT 
THAT ONLY TRUE RAINFORESTS CAN PROVIDE ALL YEAR ROUND 
TO THE EUROPEAN PLANT HUNTERS 
THESE NORTHERN RAINFORESTS MUST HAVE SEEMED A FANTASTIC AND MYSTERIOUS LOST WORLD 
YET WHEN THEY CAME HERE THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND BEAUTIFULLY CONSTRUCTED ANCIENT STONE PATHWAYS 
ON WHICH THE FOREST COULD BE EXPLORED 
WINDING WESTWARDS INTO THE HILLS 
THESE WERE ONCE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HIGHWAYS IN ASIA 
THE SOUTHWESTERN TEA AND SILK ROAD 
BUILT THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO 
THE SOUTHWESTERN TEA AND SILK ROAD GAVE ACCESS TO THE WORLD BEYOND CHINA'S BORDERS 
CARRYING TRADESMEN AND TRAVELLERS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS ROME 
WARS WERE FOUGHT OVER ACCESS TO THIS TINY PATH 
THE ONLY SURE ROUTE IN OR OUT OF CHINA 
THAT WAS GUARANTEED TO BE CLEAR OF SNOW ALL YEAR ROUND 
SO WHAT CAUSES GAOLIGONGSHAN'S STRANGE AND REMARKABLE CLIMATE 
IN LATE MAY GUSTS OF WIND ARRIVE 
BRINGING WITH THEM THE KEY TO GAOLIGONGSHAN'S MYSTERY 
THE WINDS ARE HOT AND SATURATED WITH WATER 
THEY COME ALL THE WAY FROM THE INDIAN OCEAN 
CHANNELLED BY YUNNAN'S UNIQUE GEOGRAPHY 
THEY BRING WITH THEM THE MOISTURE OF THE TROPICAL MONSOON 
THE GIANT RIVER VALLEYS CREATED MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO 
ACT LIKE IMMENSE FUNNELS 
THE GORGES ARE SO DEEP AND NARROW 
THAT THE MOIST WARM AIR IS DRIVEN RIGHT UP INTO THE NORTH OF YUNNAN 
THE RESULT IS RAIN IN TORRENTS 
FOUR MONTHS OF DAILY RAINSTORMS SUSTAIN LUXURIANT VEGETATION 
THE ARRIVAL OF THE MONSOON 
AWAKENS ONE OF THE FOREST'S MOST EXTRAORDINARY MOISTURE LOVING INHABITANTS 
THE CROCODILE NEWT IS ONE OF THE MOST UNUSUAL OF THE MANY AMPHIBIAN SPECIES FOUND HERE 
AS THE RAINS ARRIVE THEY EMERGE TO MATE 
THE NEWTS ARE SAID TO LEAVE AN ODOUR TRAIL THAT POTENTIAL MATES CAN FOLLOW 
THE CROCODILE NEWT GETS ITS NAME FROM THE BUMPS ALONG ITS BACK 
THESE ARE ITS DEFENCE 
IF GRABBED BY A POTENTIAL PREDATOR 
THE TIPS OF ITS RIBS SQUEEZE A DEADLY POISON FROM THE BUMPS 
THE DELUGE WAKES ANOTHER FOREST INHABITANT 
THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY ASTOUNDING IN ITS VIGOUR 
IT CAN GROW UP TO A METRE A DAY 
FAST OVERTAKING THE OTHER PLANTS AROUND IT 
THE TALLER IT GROWS THE FASTER ITS GROWTH RATE 
SO THAT IN A MATTER OF DAYS IT TOWERS ABOVE THE UNDERGROWTH 
AND CONTINUES REACHING FOR THE SKY 
NOT BAD FOR WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A GRASS 
IT'S BAMBOO 
GIVEN THE CHANCE 
BAMBOO WILL CREATE IMMENSE FORESTS DOMINATING ENTIRE AREAS 
BAMBOO FORESTS OCCUR ACROSS SOUTHWEST CHINA 
ALL THE WAY TO SHANGHAI 
BUT PROBABLY THE HIGHEST DIVERSITY OF BAMBOOS IN THE WORLD 
IS FOUND ON THE HILLS AND VALLEYS OF YUNNAN 
THOUGH INCREDIBLY STRONG BAMBOOS HAVE HOLLOW STEMS 
A PERFECT SHELTER FOR ANY CREATURES WHICH CAN FIND A WAY IN 
THIS ENTRANCE HOLE WAS MADE BY A BEETLE 
BUT IT'S BEING USED BY A VERY DIFFERENT ANIMAL 
A BAMBOO BAT 
THE SIZE OF A BUMBLEBEE IT'S ONE OF THE TINIEST MAMMALS IN THE WORLD 
THE ENTIRE COLONY UP TO TWENTY FIVE BATS 
FITS INTO A SINGLE SECTION OF BAMBOO STEM SMALLER THAN A TEA CUP 
IT'S QUITE A SQUEEZE 
HALF THE COLONY ARE BABIES 
THOUGH BARELY A WEEK OLD THEY ARE ALREADY ALMOST AS BIG AS THEIR MUMS 
FEEDING SUCH A FAST GROWING BROOD IS HARD WORK 
THE MUMS LEAVE TO HUNT JUST AFTER DUSK EACH NIGHT 
BACK IN THE ROOST THE YOUNG ARE LEFT ON THEIR OWN 
SPECIAL PADS ON THEIR WINGS HELP THEM TO GRIP ON THE BAMBOO WALLS 
MOST OF THE TIME 
THE YOUNG BATS USE THE EXTRA SPACE TO PREPARE FOR A LIFE ON THE WING 
BY PREENING AND STRETCHING 
PACKED IN LIKE SARDINES THEY WOULD MAKE AN EASY TARGET FOR A SNAKE 
BUT THE SNAKE HAS NO CHANCE OF GETTING IN 
THE ENTRANCE IS THINNER THAN THE WIDTH OF A PENCIL 
WHEN THE MOTHERS RETURN 
THEY CAN PUSH THROUGH THE NARROW ENTRANCE ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR UNUSUALLY FLATTENED SKULLS 
BUT IT'S STILL A SQUEEZE 
BAMBOOS ARE EXPLOITED IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY BY ANOTHER FOREST DWELLER 
FRESH BAMBOO SHOOTS ARE AN IMPORTANT FOREST CROP 
AI LAO XIANG IS OF THE HANI TRIBE 
FROM THE MOUNTAIN VILLAGE OF MENGSONG 
ROASTED THE TENDER SHOOTS HE GATHERS WILL MAKE A TASTY DISH 
THE HANI HAVE MANY USES FOR THE DIFFERENT BAMBOOS THEY GROW AND FIND IN THE FOREST AROUND 
THOUGH FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO BE WOVEN 
BAMBOO HAS A HIGHER TENSILE STRENGTH THAN STEEL 
SUCCULENT WHEN YOUNG 
IN MATURITY IT'S TOUGH AND DURABLE IDEAL FOR MAKING A TABLE 
AND STRONG ENOUGH FOR A PIPE TO LAST A LIFETIME 
THE PEOPLE OF SOUTHWEST CHINA 
HAVE FOUND AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF WAYS TO EXPLOIT THIS MOST VERSATILE OF PLANTS 
PART OF BAMBOO'S PHENOMENAL SUCCESS 
IS THAT IT'S SO TOUGH THAT FEW ANIMALS CAN TACKLE IT 
YET BAMBOO DOES COME UNDER ATTACK 
A BAMBOO RAT 
FEEDING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON BAMBOO 
THEY LIVE THEIR ENTIRE LIVES IN TUNNELS BENEATH THE FOREST 
THE THINNER SPECIES OF BAMBOO ARE EASY TO ATTACK AND PULL BELOW 
SHE HAS A FANTASTIC SENSE OF SMELL 
AND CAN SNIFF OUT THE FRESH GROWTH THROUGH THE SOIL 
BAMBOO SPREADS ALONG UNDERGROUND STEMS 
BY FOLLOWING THESE NEW SHOOTS ARE FOUND 
ONCE A SHOOT IS DETECTED 
SHE SNIPS IT FREE AND DRAGS IT DOWN INTO HER BURROW 
THIS FEMALE HAS A FAMILY 
AT JUST A FEW WEEKS OLD 
THE YOUNGSTERS CAN ALREADY TACKLE THE HARDEST BAMBOO STEMS 
AND ARE EAGER TO TRY 
BAMBOO'S TOUGH REPUTATION IS SUCH 
THAT ANOTHER BAMBOO SPECIALIST WAS KNOWN BY THE CHINESE AS THE IRON EATING ANIMAL 
THE GIANT PANDA IS FAMOUS FOR ITS EXCLUSIVE DIET 
GIANT PANDAS ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE ORIGINATED IN SOUTHWEST CHINA MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO 
BUT THEY ARE NO LONGER FOUND IN YUNNAN 
RECENTLY THEIR SPECIALISED DIET HAS HAD DIRE CONSEQUENCES 
BAMBOO HAS A BIZARRE LIFE CYCLE 
FLOWERING INFREQUENTLY SOMETIMES ONLY ONCE EVERY HUNDRED YEARS OR SO 
BUT WHEN FLOWERING DOES OCCUR IT'S ON A MASSIVE SCALE 
AND IT'S FOLLOWED BY THE DEATH OF ALL OF THE PLANTS 
SOMETIMES AN ENTIRE BAMBOO FOREST MAY DIE 
IN UNDISTURBED HABITAT PANDAS SIMPLY MOVE TO ANOTHER AREA 
WHERE A DIFFERENT BAMBOO SPECIES GROWS 
BUT AS HUMAN ACTIVITY HAS FRAGMENTED THEIR FOREST HOME 
PANDAS FIND IT INCREASINGLY HARD TO FIND LARGE ENOUGH AREAS IN WHICH TO SURVIVE 
WILD PANDAS ARE NOW FOUND ONLY IN THE FORESTS OF CENTRAL CHINA 
FAR TO THE EAST 
BUT IN THE HIDDEN POCKETS OF LOWLAND JUNGLE IN YUNNAN'S TROPICAL SOUTH 
LIVE ONE OF CHINA'S BEST KEPT WILDLIFE SECRETS 
THE WILD ASIAN ELEPHANT 
ELEPHANTS ONCE ROAMED ACROSS CHINA AS FAR NORTH AS BEIJING 
BUT IT'S ONLY IN THE HIDDEN VALLEYS OF YUNNAN THAT THEY HAVE SURVIVED 
ELEPHANTS ARE THE ARCHITECTS OF THE FOREST 
BAMBOOS AND GRASSES ARE THEIR FAVOURITE FOOD 
BUT SAPLINGS TREE LEAVES AND TWISTED LIANAS ARE ALL TAKEN WITH LITTLE CARE 
AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE FOREST 
THE ELEPHANTS OPEN UP CLEARINGS BRINGING LIGHT TO THE FOREST FLOOR 
THIS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THEIR HOME 
THE RICHEST FORESTS ARE NOW KNOWN TO BE THOSE WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCE CHANGE 
THE JINOU PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THEIR FORESTS 
AND CLAIM TO HAVE USES FOR MOST OF THE PLANTS THAT THEY FIND THERE 
THEY HAVE NAMES FOR THEM ALL 
THOSE GOOD FOR EATING AND SOME WHICH EVEN HAVE STRONG MEDICINAL QUALITIES 
BY WORKING HERE THE JINOU PLAY A SIMILAR ROLE TO THE ELEPHANTS 
OPENING UP THE FOREST BRINGING SPACE LIGHT AND DIVERSITY 
GREEN FAST GROWING SPECIES ARE ENCOURAGED 
INSECTS ARE IN HIGH ABUNDANCE HERE 
TOGETHER WITH THE ANIMALS THAT FEED ON THEM 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE FOREST ENABLES THE JINOU TO FIND NOT JUST PLANTS 
BUT OTHER TASTY FOREST FOOD TOO 
FOREST CRABS ARE COMMON HERE FEEDING ON THE ABUNDANT LEAF LITTER 
THIS WILL BE A TASTY ADDITION TO THE EVENING MEAL 
FLOWING THROUGH YUNNAN'S SOUTHERN VALLEYS 
THE ONCE ANGRY RIVERS ARE NOW SWOLLEN 
THEIR WATERS SLOW AND WARM 
THESE FERTILE LOWLAND VALLEYS ARE THE HOME OF THE DAI 
THE PEOPLE OF THE WATER 
LIVE ALONG STREAMS WHICH ORIGINATE IN THE SURROUNDING HILLS 
EACH FAMILY KEEPS A KITCHEN GARDEN 
MODELLED ON THE MULTI LAYERED STRUCTURE OF THE SURROUNDING FORESTS 
WHICH THE DAI HOLD SACRED 
THE GARDENS ARE MADE MORE PRODUCTIVE BY INTER PLANTING DIFFERENT CROPS 
TALL SUN LOVING SPECIES GIVE SHELTER TO PLANTS WHICH THRIVE IN THE SHADE 
AS COMPANIONS THE PLANTS GROW BETTER 
YUNNAN'S FORESTS ARE HOME TO MORE THAN A DOZEN WILD BANANA SPECIES 
AND BANANA CROPS GROW WELL IN MOST DAI GARDENS 
THE HUGE BANANA FLOWERS ARE RICH IN NECTAR FOR ONLY TWO HOURS A DAY 
BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO ATTRACT A RANGE OF FOREST INSECTS INCLUDING HORNETS 
WITH THEIR RAZOR SHARP MANDIBLES 
THEY FIND IT EASY TO ROB THE FLOWERS OF THEIR NECTAR 
BUT HORNETS ARE PREDATORS TOO 
THEY HUNT OTHER INSECTS AND CARRY THEM BACK TO THEIR NEST 
AN IDEAL TARGET 
BUT THIS GRASSHOPPER IS NO EASY MEAL 
THERE MAY BE A PRICE TO PAY 
THE DAI MEN PO AND XUE MING TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A HUNTER'S INSTINCTS 
A HORNET STING IS AGONY 
BUT FOR NOW IT'S DISTRACTED INTENT ON CUTTING AWAY 
A PIECE OF GRASSHOPPER SMALL ENOUGH TO CARRY BACK HOME 
SUCCESS 
THE WHITE FEATHER HARDLY SLOWS THE HORNET 
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY 
IT CAN BE SEEN 
NOW THE HUNTER IS THE HUNTED 
SO LONG AS PO AND XUE MING CAN KEEP UP 
BACK AT THE NEST THE OTHER HORNETS 
IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO CUT THE FEATHER FREE 
BUT IT'S TOO LATE THE NEST'S LOCATION HAS BEEN BETRAYED 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FOREST ANIMALS AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE 
WAS NEVER ONE OF HARMONY 
YET THE FACT THAT THE DAI AND OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS CONSIDERED THESE FORESTS TO BE SACRED 
HAS ENSURED THEIR SURVIVAL 
AND NOW MANY HAVE BEEN GIVEN EXTRA PROTECTION AS NATURE RESERVES 
INGENUITY AND HARD WORK PAYS OFF AT LAST 
THE FATTENED LARVAE ARE CONSIDERED A DELICACY BY THE DAI 
ALTHOUGH THESE FORESTS HAVE EXPERIENCED A GREAT DEAL OF CHANGE 
THEY ARE STILL HOST TO SOME ANCIENT AND INCREDIBLE RELATIONSHIPS 
ALMOST SIXTY CENTIMETRES HIGH 
THIS IS THE IMMENSE FLOWER OF THE ELEPHANT YAM 
LOCALS CALL IT THE WITCH OF THE FOREST 
AS THE STARS RISE THE WITCH BEGINS TO CAST HER SPELL 
THE FOREST TEMPERATURE DROPS BUT THE FLOWER STARTS TO HEAT UP 
A HEAT SENSITIVE CAMERA REVEALS THE FLOWER'S TEMPERATURE 
RISING BY AN INCREDIBLE TEN DEGREES CELSIUS 
AT THE SAME TIME A NOXIOUS STENCH OF ROTTING FLESH FILLS THE FOREST AIR 
AS THE FLOWER'S HEAT INCREASES A CLOUD OF ODOUR RISES UP 
THE FOUL PERFUME CARRIES FAR AND WIDE 
IT DOESN'T GO UNNOTICED 
CARRION BEETLES ARRIVE ON THE SCENE 
THE BEETLES COME IN SEARCH OF A FEAST OF WARM DECAYING FLESH 
BUT THEY'VE BEEN TRICKED 
SLIPPERY SIDES ENSURE THEY TUMBLE 
STRAIGHT INTO THE CENTRE OF THE MONSTER FLOWER 
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM TO SPREAD THEIR WINGS 
AND THE WAXY WALLS ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO ESCAPE 
BUT THERE'S NOTHING SINISTER IN THE FLOWER'S AGENDA 
THE BEETLES WILL BE ITS UNWITTING HELPERS 
DAWN ARRIVES 
BUT THE FLOWER REMAINS UNCHANGED HOLDING ITS CAPTIVES THROUGH THE DAY 
AS THE SECOND NIGHT FALLS THE WITCH STIRS AGAIN 
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES THE FLOWER'S PRECIOUS GOLDEN POLLEN 
SQUEEZES FROM THE STAMENS AND BEGINS TO FALL 
SHOWERING ONTO THE CAPTIVE BEETLES BELOW 
NOW AT LAST THE PRISONERS ARE FREE TO GO 
THE FLOWER'S WALL CHANGES TEXTURE BECOMING ROUGH 
TO PROVIDE THE IDEAL ESCAPE LADDER 
LOADED WITH THEIR POLLEN PARCELS THEY CAN NOW CLIMB TO FREEDOM 
JUST AS OTHER FOREST WITCHES ARE BEGINNING TO OPEN 
SEDUCED BY THE IRRESISTIBLE PERFUME THE BEETLES ARE SURE TO PAY A VISIT 
SO ENSURING POLLINATION 
AND ANOTHER GENERATION OF INCREDIBLY BIG SMELLY FLOWERS 
AS DAWN ARRIVES FOREST BIRDS CLAIM THEIR TERRITORIES IN THE CANOPY 
BUT THERE'S ONE CALL WHICH STANDS OUT AMONG THE REST 
VIRTUOSO OF THE FOREST SYMPHONY 
IT'S A GIBBON 
LIVING ON A REMOTE MOUNTAIN RANGE IN SOUTH CENTRAL YUNNAN 
IS ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING WILD GIBBON POPULATIONS IN CHINA 
THE BLACK CRESTED GIBBONS OF WULIANGSHAN 
THEY ARE CONFINED TO THESE FOREST MOUNTAINS 
SO REMOTE AND STEEP THAT FEW HUNTERS EVER COME HERE 
THE WULIANGSHAN GIBBONS ARE UNUSUAL FOR THEIR SOCIAL STRUCTURE 
MOST GIBBONS LIVE IN SMALL FAMILY GROUPS 
CONSISTING OF A MATING PAIR AND THEIR OFFSPRING 
BUT THESE GIBBONS EXIST IN TROOPS 
ONE MALE CAN HAVE TWO OR SOMETIMES THREE FEMALES 
AND ALL OF THESE CAN HAVE YOUNG 
OFTEN EVEN THE JUVENILES STAY IN THE COMMUNITY 
RARELY GLIMPSED THIS BABY MAY BE ONLY A DAY OLD 
IF IT SURVIVES INFANCY THEN IT HAS A PROMISING FUTURE 
IN THESE FEW VALLEYS WITH ITS CLOSE KNIT FAMILY 
GIBBON SONG ONCE INSPIRED THE ANCIENT POETS OF CHINA 
THEIR GLORIOUS CALLS ECHOING FAR ACROSS THE HILLS 
BUT NOW NEW STRANGELY QUIET FORESTS HAVE COME TO YUNNAN 
THESE TREES ARE HERE TO PRODUCE AN IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE CROP 
WHEN THE TREE BARK IS SCORED IT YIELDS COPIOUS STICKY SAP 
SO BITTER AND TACKY THAT NOTHING CAN FEED ON IT 
IT'S THE TREE'S NATURAL DEFENCE AGAINST ATTACK 
IT'S COLLECTED DAILY 
BOWL BY BOWL 
IT WILL BE BOILED AND PROCESSED INTO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MATERIALS 
TO A FAST DEVELOPING NATION RUBBER 
THE EXPANSION OF THE RUBBER FORESTS BEGAN IN THE FIFTIES WHEN CHINA 
UNDER A WORLD RUBBER EMBARGO 
HAD TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT IN THIS VITAL PRODUCT 
BEIJING TURNED TO THE ONLY PLACE WHERE RUBBER COULD GROW 
THE TROPICAL SOUTH OF YUNNAN 
WITH EFFICIENCY AND SPEED 
SOME OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST FORESTS WERE TORN UP AND BURNED 
REPLACED WITH MILE UPON MILE OF RUBBER PLANTATION 
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM FOR THE RUBBER GROWERS 
WHILE YUNNAN'S UNIQUE NATURAL FORESTS 
CAN SURVIVE ON THE VALLEY SLOPES WHICH STRETCH TO THE NORTH 
JUST ONE SEVERE FROST WILL KILL OFF THESE DELICATE RUBBER TREES 
SO YUNNAN'S TERRAIN PUTS A LIMIT ON HOW FAR THE PLANTATIONS CAN SPREAD 
HALTING AT LEAST THEIR NORTHWARDS ADVANCE 
THE JUNGLES OF YUNNAN ARE INCREASINGLY UNDER PRESSURE 
NEW ROADS CRISS CROSS THE TINY REMNANT FORESTS 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR TRADE INDUSTRY AND INCREASINGLY TOURISM 
IT'S A MEETING OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT WORLDS 
THAT ELEPHANTS STILL EXIST IN CHINA IS REMARKABLE 
CONSIDERING THE IMMENSE PRESSURES 
IN THE WORLD'S MOST HIGHLY POPULATED COUNTRY 
THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR SO WILD ELEPHANTS WHICH STILL LIVE HERE 
ARE NOW STRICTLY PROTECTED 
AND EACH YEAR YOUNG ARE BORN TO THE SMALL HERDS 
IF ELEPHANTS WERE TO SURVIVE ANYWHERE IN CHINA 
IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN HERE IN YUNNAN 
THE SAME MOUNTAINS WHICH GUIDE THE MONSOON RAINS NORTH 
AND WHICH MADE JOSEPH ROCK'S JOURNEYS SO TREACHEROUS 
ALSO GUARDED YUNNAN'S FORESTS AND ITS WILDLIFE 
FOR THE MOMENT THE MOUNTAINS ARE STILL CARPETED IN A RICH GREEN 
DECEPTIVE IN ITS SIMPLICITY 
BELOW THE CANOPY LIES PERHAPS CHINA'S RICHEST NATURAL TREASURE 
DELICATE AND UNIQUE 
A COMPLEX WORLD OF INTRICATE RELATIONSHIPS 
BETWEEN ANIMALS PLANTS AND PEOPLE BENEATH THE CLOUDS
