THE QUESTION AS EVER WAS HOW TO BE HAPPY 
BUT IN NINETEEN SIXTY IF YOU WERE AMERICAN WHITE AND WHITE COLLAR 
YOUR CHANCES OF HAPPINESS HAD NEVER SEEMED GREATER 
THAT AT LEAST WAS THE SONG THE AD MEN ON MADISON AVENUE WERE SINGING 
I LOVE YOUR EYES THE WAY THEY SMILE 
I LOVE YOUR HAIR THE WAY IT GLOWS JUST LIKE THE SUN 
THE MIDNIGHT SUN PRODUCT 
HEY THAT'S A GREAT TRACK WAY OUT 
AMERICANS IN NINETEEN SIXTY WERE A PEOPLE OF PLENTY 
THEIR NATIONAL CHARACTER MOULDED BY THE EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPECTATION OF ABUNDANCE 
TO UNDERSTAND THIS AMERICA WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT MIGHT BECOME 
MADISON AVENUE WAS THE PLACE TO LOOK 
WHEN I RAN A CAMPAIGN I EXPECTED THE COUNTRY 
TO LOOK AT THAT ADVERT AND GO WOW BOOM 
AND TALK ABOUT IT THE NEXT DAY 
AND THEN BUY IT 
MADISON AVENUE WAS THE CHORUS LINE OF CAPITALISM 
THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED THERE COULD SHIFT NOT JUST PRODUCTS 
BUT THE WHOLE CULTURE 
BY WORKING THE LEVERS OF AMERICA'S DREAMS AND DESIRES 
WE SIT DOWN WITH THIS WOMAN WHETHER IT BE PRINT OR TELEVISION OR RADIO 
AND WE SAY TO HER VERY SIMPLY WE UNDERSTAND YOU WE SYMPATHISE WITH YOU 
AND SHE SAYS MY GOD THAT'S HOW I REALLY FEEL 
THAT WAS JUST TERRIFIC ALL RIGHT PRINT THAT ONE 
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 
I UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE AND HOW TO GO AHEAD OF THE CULTURE 
I UNDERSTAND HOW TO PULL A CULTURE WITH ME 
I'M TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH AND SAY IT'S A NEW KIND OF AMERICA WE SHOULD BE BUILDING 
WE STAND TODAY ON THE EDGE OF A NEW FRONTIER 
THE FRONTIER OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
ON THE FRONTIER OF THIS NEW DECADE THE CHALLENGES OF FEMINISM VIETNAM 
AND THE COUNTER CULTURE STILL LAY IN THE FUTURE 
NEW YORK'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WAS STILL CALLED IDLEWILD 
AND THERE WAS A GIANT BILLBOARD FOR HERTZ RENTACAR 
ON TOP OF THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY IN DALLAS 
THE QUESTION AS EVER WAS HOW TO BE HAPPY 
NOT HOW LONG WILL THIS HAPPINESS LAST 
AMERICA IN NINETEEN SIXTY WAS A LAND OF PLENTY 
FROM THE COMMERCIAL BREAKS TO THE PAGES OF THE WEEKLY MAGAZINES 
A CORNUCOPIA OF FAVOURITE THINGS WAS ON OFFER 
THE BIBLE FOR THIS CONSUMERS' REPUBLIC 
WAS THE SEARS MAIL ORDER CATALOGUE 
WHICH IN NINETEEN SIXTY WEIGHED IN AT FOUR POUNDS 
AND CONTAINED MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PAGES OF PRODUCTS 
FROM ABDOMINAL BANDS 
TO ZIPPERS 
I SEE I SEE STYLES AND SHIRTS 
AND THE KIND OF 
THE KIND OF LOOK THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN BACK THEN 
YOU KNOW YOU COULD GET ANYTHING FROM A SEARS CATALOGUE 
IT COVERED AMERICAN LIFE 
AND FOR ME IT'S A KIND OF ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CULTURE 
THE KEYWORD FOR THIS CULTURE WAS AFFLUENCE 
AFFLUENCE WAS FULLNESS 
MONEY MOVING 
GOODS FLOWING 
ENERGY CHUGGING 
AMERICA'S MOVING ROLLING 
IT HAD NOTHING BUT GOODNESS ROLLING OUT OF IT 
THERE WAS NO SUGGESTION THAT THERE COULD EVER BE TOO MUCH AFFLUENCE 
BUT EVEN AS AMERICA ACCELERATED INTO THE AFFLUENT SIXTIES 
THE BAD OLD DAYS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION 
STILL LOOMED LARGE IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THE PROMISE THE FULLNESS OF AFFLUENCE WAS OFTEN SEEN 
IN RELATION TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION 
IT WAS THE END OF THE ARC THAT LED FROM THE GREAT DEPRESSION 
WHERE WE WERE THEN COLLECTIVELY IN THE SOUP 
THEN COLLECTIVELY WITHOUT 
NOW WE WERE COLLECTIVELY WITH 
THE AMERICA WE LIVE IN HAS ENOUGH BOUNTY AND GOODNESS FOR EVERYONE 
AND SO MUCH OF THAT GOODNESS GOES INTO ARNOLD BRICK OVEN BREAD 
MILK HONEY TABLE BUTTER 
THIS SENSE OF COLLECTIVE WELL BEING SUGGESTED THAT CAPITALISM'S PROMISE 
OF A LAND OF MILK AND HONEY FOR ALL MIGHT ACTUALLY BE REALISED 
WHAT YOU HAD SEEN REALLY IN THE SPACE OF MAYBE FIFTEEN YEARS 
WAS JUST AN INCREDIBLE GENERATION OF WEALTH 
AND ALSO AN INCREDIBLE DIFFUSION OF PROSPERITY 
GENERALISED PROSPERITY TO MOST OF THE COUNTRY 
WHAT YOU HAD SEEN WAS REALLY THE CREATION OF 
A TRUE PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS 
PEOPLE IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS MIDDLE CLASS 
AND THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR 
WHILE OBVIOUSLY NOT ERASED 
WAS BY COMPARISON WITH THE PRESENT RELATIVELY SHALLOW 
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY ENORMOUS SOCIAL DIFFERENCES 
ESPECIALLY BETWEEN WHITES AND BLACKS 
THERE WAS FIRST CLASS AND THERE WAS STEERAGE BUT IT WAS STILL THE SAME BOAT 
AND NOW FOR A LOOK AT THE SOVIET CONSUMER 
AND IF ANYONE HAD ANY DOUBTS ABOUT THE SUPERIORITY OF THE AMERICAN WAY 
THERE WAS ALWAYS BRAND X. TO COMPARE IT TO 
A PACKAGE OF CORNFLAKES IS THE SUBJECT OF A SOVIET FILM 
WHICH LOOKS LIKE ONE OF OUR LESS INSPIRED T. V. COMMERCIALS 
COMRADES DO YOU SUFFER FROM LOSS OF FREEDOM 
DO EVERYDAY WORRIES LIKE THE SECRET POLICE BOTHER YOU 
THEN TRY OUR KREMLIN FLAKES THEY'RE CORNY 
CONSUMER CULTURE IS THE ENGINE OF DEMOCRACY 
THE ENGINE THAT IS DRIVING 
WHAT WAS THEN THE MOST POPULAR TERM FOR THIS DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM 
CAPITAL D. CAPITAL C. 
AMERICA 
OF GIVING THEM CHOICES 
THAT WE HAD FREEDOM THAT THE RUSSIANS DIDN'T 
AND THAT FREEDOM IS BEST EXPERIENCED 
THROUGH OUR ABILITY TO CHOOSE AMONG A VARIETY OF CONSUMER GOODS 
AMERICA 
ARMED WITH CHEAP MORTGAGES AND LOW INTEREST LOANS 
AMERICANS WERE ENCOURAGED TO RESIST THE SPREAD OF COMMUNISM 
BY SURRENDERING TO THE RAPTURE OF CONSUMPTION 
ALL KINDS OF HARDWARE AND MACHINERY FOR THE HOME 
I MEAN LOOK PAGE AFTER PAGE OF LAWNMOWERS 
IT GOES ON AND ON 
LOOK AT THE SHAPES AND THE VARIETY OF AN OBJECT CALLED A SHOVEL 
AMERICANS GREW UP 
UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS PART OF OUR 
BIRTHRIGHT IN A WAY 
OUR CULTURAL HERITAGE WAS THAT IN THIS FREE ENTERPRISE DEMOCRACY 
YOU HAVE SIXTY SHOVELS TO CHOSE FROM 
AND BECAUSE THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERY ONE THIS IS RIGHT 
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD THING 
THE GREATEST DRIVER OF CONSUMPTION 
WAS ITSELF THE OBJECT OF CONSUMERS' GREATEST DESIRES 
THE TELEVISION 
IF THE SEARS MAIL ORDER CATALOGUE WAS THEIR BIBLE 
TELEVISION WAS THE ALTAR ON WHICH DAILY MIRACLES WERE WITNESSED 
I REMEMBER PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE STORES 
LOOKING AT THE NEW TELEVISION SETS 
WHEN COLOUR T. V. APPEARED ESPECIALLY 
THE TELEVISION HAD A PECULIAR PRESTIGE AND MAGIC ASSOCIATED WITH IT 
AND SO IT WAS YOU KNOW SOMETHING A FAMILY MIGHT DO ON A SUNDAY 
YOU KNOW TAKE THE SUBWAY DOWN TO ROCKEFELLER CENTER 
WHERE R. C. A. WAS LOCATED AND YOU KNOW 
WALK INTO THE R. C. A. BUILDING AND YOU'D SEE THE NEW GADGETS 
UM THAT WAS FUN 
A CAMPAIGN FOR MOTOROLA FROM THE EARLY SIXTIES 
SHOWS HOW THE DESIRES OF CONSUMERS WERE AMPLIFIED WITH ADS 
THAT DANCED ALONG THE BORDERLINE BETWEEN REALITY AND DREAMS 
IN ADVERTISING IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES ILLUSTRATION HELD SWAY 
IT WAS MUCH STRONGER THAN MOST PHOTOGRAPHY 
IT WAS FANTASISED I MEAN THE ILLUSTRATOR COULD PUT IN EVERYTHING 
THEY WOULD TELL THE GUY COULD YOU GIVE ME THIS OTTOMAN OVER HERE IN THIS COLOUR 
AND COULD YOU PUT THE WATERFALL IN 
SO YOU COULD DO IT AND PEOPLE ASPIRED TO THIS 
THE MOTOROLA ARTIST WAS CHARLES SCHRIDDE 
THOUGH HE LIVED AND WORKED IN GRIMY OLD DETROIT 
HIS ELABORATE LIFESTYLE FANTASIES WERE PURE CALIFORNIA 
SOME OF SCHRIDDE'S MOST SEDUCTIVE SCENES 
PLAY OUT IN A SUBURBAN PARADISE 
WHERE MANICURED LAWNS BUTT UP AGAINST THE WALL TO WALL CARPETING 
THE SUBURB REPRESENTS A KIND OF ARTIFICIAL PARADISE 
FOR THE AMERICANS WHO CAN AFFORD IT 
THE SHRINES OF SUBURBIA ARE 
THE PRIVATE HOMES AND THE DRIVEWAYS TO THEM AND THE GARAGES IN THEM 
AND THE CAR PORTS NEXT TO THEM AND OF COURSE THE STUFF INSIDE THEM 
THE VANTAGE THAT MATTERS IN THE SUBURBS 
IS THE VIEW THROUGH THE PRIVATE PICTURE WINDOW 
IT'S NOT THE CITY HALL IT'S NOT THE COURT HOUSE 
THE SUBURB BELONGS TO THE NUCLEAR FAMILY 
AND THE SEASONS WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN STRICTLY ASSOCIATED WITH NATURE 
HAVE COME TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH CONSUMER GOODS 
ISSUED ROUTINELY AT CERTAIN FIXED TIMES OF THE YEAR 
AND SO THE YEAR GETS REMADE AROUND THE RHYTHMS OF CONSUMER GOODS 
WHAT WE NEED IN OUR CAR IS 
OH WHAT DO YOU CALL IT 
AN INTERGRATED POWER TRAIN 
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE MOM KNOW THAT WE SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD ANYTHING 
BUT POP WE DON'T BUY THE LOWEST PRICE OF EVERYTHING WE GET 
OTHER PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ABLE TO PROGRESS 
TO KEEP STEPPING UP A LITTLE AS THEY GET OLDER 
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO A FAMILY OLIVER 
O. K. MOM 
WE'RE THE JONESES LET THEM KEEP UP WITH US 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE OF THE MORE EXCITING NEW PRODUCTS FOR THE JONESES OF AMERICA TO CONSIDER 
WAS CALLED J. F. K. 
I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET 
WHEN THIS BOY STARTED FOLLOWING ME 
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE NINETEEN SIXTY ELECTION 
THAT REFLECTED THE ZEITGEIST 
THAT REFLECTED THE CHANGING TIMES 
I THINK J. F. K. IS AN ALMOST PERFECT SYMBOL OF THAT 
HE WAS REALLY SAYING SOMETHIN' 
HE PUT OUT THE RIGHT IDEAL 
HE WAS QUOTE UNQUOTE SELLING FOR ME THE RIGHT THING 
WHETHER HE WOULD ULTIMATELY DELIVER 
THE POOR GUY NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO PROVE HIMSELF 
BUT HE WAS SAYING THE RIGHT THINGS 
MY CALL IS TO THE YOUNG IN HEART 
REGARDLESS OF AGE 
TO THE STOUT IN SPIRIT REGARDLESS OF PARTY 
TO ALL WHO RESPOND TO THE SCRIPTURAL CALL 
BE STRONG AND OF GOOD COURAGE BE NOT AFRAID 
HE WAS REALLY SAYING SOMETHIN' 
WE SUDDENLY HAD THIS YOUNG ATTRACTIVE 
POWERFUL GUY WHO SPOKE WELL AND HE GAVE EVERYONE A SENSE OF HOPE 
KENNEDY HAD DECLARED HIS BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE ON ELEVEN JANUARY NINETEEN SIXTY 
BUT NOT BEFORE SOME LAST MINUTE TINKERING WITH THE INGREDIENTS 
HE HAD WHAT THEY CALLED A BOYISH FORELOCK 
HE HAD SORT OF A MASS OF CURLS IF YOU WILL 
AND IT WAS MUCH MORE UNKEMPT 
WHEN HE DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT 
THE FORELOCK WAS GONE AND THEY SCULPTED HIS HAIR MORE INTO THAT 
WHAT WE THINK OF AS THE KENNEDY ESQUE HELMET 
WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE HIM LOOK OLDER AND MORE DIGNIFIED 
AND GIVE HIM AN AIR OF GRAVITAS 
HIS STYLE WAS VERY NEW 
IT WAS VERY COOL THERE WAS A COOL STYLE TO IT 
ALTHOUGH HE WAS YOUNG AND FRESH 
THERE WAS ALSO SOMETHING KIND OF RESTRAINED ABOUT HIM 
YOU CAN SEE THE CHANGE THAT TELEVISION BROUGHT 
BEFORE T. V. HOW DID YOU CAMPAIGN 
YOU WENT TO STRANGERS YOU PUT YOUR ARM AROUND THEM 
YOU KISSED THEIR BABIES YOU TOUCHED THEM 
IF YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE LYNDON JOHNSON 
THERE ARE PICTURES OF HIM IN PEOPLE'S FACES 
VERY PHYSICAL WITH THEM 
KENNEDY HATED THAT 
HE HE HATED KISSING BABIES AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING 
HE DIDN'T LIKE THE INTIMACY THAT WAS FORCED UPON HIM 
SO HE WAS THIS COOL MAN OF DETACHMENT 
ONE WAY IN WHICH KENNEDY EXPRESSED HIS INDIVIDUALITY 
AND PROTECTED HIS TRADEMARK BOUFFANT HAIR DO 
WAS BY REFUSING TO DON THE EMBLEM OF ALL RED BLOODED WHITE COLLARED AMERICAN MALES 
THE FEDORA 
JOHN F. KENNEDY WANTED PEOPLE TO SEE HIM 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FEW PHOTOGRAPHS OF KENNEDY WEARING A HAT 
YOU CAN'T SEE THAT HE'S THERE 
WITHOUT THE HAT HE HAS THIS WONDERFUL EDIFICE OF CHESTNUT HAIR 
IT'S A TRADEMARK PEOPLE CALLED IT A TRADEMARK AT THE TIME 
YOU CAN INSTANTLY SEE IT'S JOHN F. KENNEDY 
WHEN YOU SEE A PICTURE OF HIM WITH A HAT YOU CAN BARELY TELL IT'S HIM 
BUT FOR SOME HATLESS JACK WAS A NIGHTMARE 
THIS WAS A MAN WHOSE USE OF STRAIGHT BACK ROCKING CHAIRS 
OR CIGARS 
LED TO AN IMMEDIATE SPIKE IN SALES 
J. F. K. WAS A WALKING BILLBOARD 
FOR THE HAT MAKERS OF AMERICA 
A HATLESS J. F. K. WAS A MARKETING DISASTER 
AND GETTING ONE ON HIS HEAD BECAME A MAJOR PREOCCUPATION 
A KENNEDY PHOTOGRAPHER IN HIS MEMOIRS SAID 
HAT SALESMAN DOGGED OUR ROUTE 
THEY'D SHOW UP IN A TOWN AND THE GUY FROM THE LOCAL HAT STORE 
WOULD TRY TO MAKE KENNEDY WEAR A HAT 
I'VE JUST BEEN PRESENTED THIS HAT 
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO WEAR IT QUITE YET 
I GOTTA STAY IN TEXAS ABOUT THREE MORE DAYS BEFORE I'LL 
AND IT WAS SORT OF THIS GAME PEOPLE WOULD PLAY 
YOU SEE CONSTANTLY PEOPLE TRYING TO SLAP ONE ON HIS HEAD 
AND HIM TRYING TO SQUIRM OUT FROM UNDER IT 
HE HAD MAGIC AND CHARISMA AND EVERYONE WANTED PART OF THAT 
I'M GONNA WEAR THIS IN THE SAINT PATRICK'S DAY PARADE IN BOSTON 
FITZGERALD KENNEDY DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR 
I JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR 
IN JANUARY NINETEEN SIXTY ONE VICTORIOUS AND HATLESS 
J. F. K. TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE 
THE WORDS NEW ANEW AND RENEWAL 
APPEARED ELEVEN TIMES IN HIS INAUGURAL SPEECH 
THE TORCH HAS BEEN PASSED 
TO A NEW GENERATION OF AMERICANS 
IN A NEW ALLIANCE FOR PROGRESS 
SIGNIFYING RENEWAL 
WE RENEW OUR PLEDGE OF SUPPORT 
TO STRENGTHEN ITS SHIELD OF THE NEW AND THE WEAK 
THAT BOTH SIDES BEGIN ANEW THE QUEST FOR PEACE 
SO LET US BEGIN ANEW 
A NEW ENDEAVOUR 
NOT A NEW BALANCE OF POWER 
BUT A NEW WORLD OF LAW 
CONFESSIONS OF AN ADVERTISING MAN BY CREATIVE DIRECTOR DAVID OGILVY 
CAME OUT THAT SAME MONTH 
IN IT OGILVY OBSERVED 
THE TWO MOST POWERFUL WORDS YOU CAN USE IN A HEADLINE ARE FREE AND NEW 
YOU CAN SELDOM USE FREE BUT YOU CAN ALMOST ALWAYS USE NEW 
'. WONDERFUL NEW WORLD OF PUSH BUTTON COOKING 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY NEW YORK WAS ALSO IN THE BUSINESS OF RENEWAL 
IT WAS SHEDDING ITS SKIN 
AND BUILDING AN ECONOMIC AND ICONIC SUPREMACY 
IT HADN'T ENJOYED SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
NEW YORK WAS UNDERGOING ONE OF ITS GREATEST BUILDING BOOMS IN ITS HISTORY 
THERE HAD BEEN ALMOST NOTHING BUILT IN THE WAY OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE SPACE 
IN NEW YORK WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ROCKEFELLER CENTER 
SO THERE WAS THIS PENT UP NEED FOR A HUGE AMOUNT OF NEW OFFICE SPACE 
AS A RESULT WHOLE NEW AVENUES WERE REBUILT IT SEEMED OVERNIGHT 
NEW YORK WAS BEING RENEWED 
YOU COULD HARDLY TAKE A STROLL THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY 
WITHOUT HAVING YOUR THOUGHTS INVADED BY THE SOUNDS OF 
OF IRON BALLS WHACKING AGAINST SOME STONE WALL HERE OR THERE 
BUILDINGS WENT UP WITH SUCH SPEED 
FIRST OF ALL YOU SEE EXCAVATIONS YOU SEE THE BULLDOZERS 
THE EARTH IS BEING DUG UP AND THEN YOU COME BACK A MONTH LATER 
AND THERE WAS STEEL AND THE MONTH LATER THERE WAS GLASS 
AND PEOPLE WERE RUNNING ELEVATORS UP AND DOWN 
IT WAS ALMOST INSTANT 
BUILDINGS FIFTY SIXTY STOREYS HIGH 
WERE ALMOST UP IN A MATTER OF WEEKS IT SEEMED 
PARK AVENUE AND THIRD AVENUE AND SIXTH AVENUE WERE WERE TORN DOWN 
AND BLOCK AFTER BLOCK WERE TRANSFORMED 
INTO HIGH RISE MODERN OFFICE STRUCTURES 
IN THE INTERNATIONAL STYLE 
MODERN CASTLES OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY 
BUILT OF GLASS ALUMINIUM STEEL PLASTICS CERAMICS 
THEY ARE SOUND PROOFED AIR CONDITIONED 
THERE WAS ALMOST SOMETHING NARCISSISTIC 
ABOUT THESE GLASS SKYSCRAPERS OFFICE BUILDINGS 
YOU COULD SEE FROM THE SIDEWALK ALMOST WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE 
YOU COULD SEE DESKS YOU COULD SEE THE GOOD LOOKING SECRETARIES 
AND YOU COULD SEE WHAT REPRESENTED AMERICAN BUSINESS CULTURE SUCH AS IT WAS 
AND YOU COULD SEE THERE WAS A TRANSPARENCY THERE WAS NARCISSISM 
THERE WAS A REFLECTION 
IT WAS SMOOTH AND OPEN 
IT ADVERTISED ITSELF 
LEVER HOUSE JUST ACROSS THE STREET FROM US HERE 
WAS THE FIRST COMMERCIAL GLASS AND STEEL OFFICE BUILDING IN THE WORLD 
AND THAT REALLY WAS A LANDMARK BUILDING IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD 
IT GAVE A NEW IMAGE TO THE MODERN CITY 
AND THEN THE FINAL WORD ON IT SO TO SPEAK 
THE MOST ELEGANT EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE BUILDING WE'RE SITTING IN 
WHICH IS THE SEAGRAM BUILDING 
THIS WAS A KIND OF MESMERISING 
THE NEW POST WAR SUPER POWER 
NOW PUTTING OUT ITS POWER NOT THROUGH MILITARY FORCE 
BUT THROUGH WHAT WE WOULD CALL SOFT POWER INFLUENCE 
A SEDUCTIVE VISION OF WHAT THE FUTURE COULD BE 
HERE WAS THIS SPECTACULAR FRESH URBAN ARCHITECTURE 
THAT SEEMS TO PORTEND A KIND OF A CLEAN NEW BRIGHT WORLD 
OF WHAT POST WAR URBAN LIFE WAS GOING TO BE LIKE 
A KIND OF AN OPTIMISTIC IDEA OF A CIVIL PEACEFUL 
GLOBAL ECONOMIC ORDER 
THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED RIGHT THEN AND THERE IN NEW YORK 
THE TRANSFORMATION OF NEW YORK PROMPTED TIME MAGAZINE IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
TO WAX LYRICAL 
ON A WINTER'S EVENING WHEN THE DUSK DROPS SUDDENLY 
AND THE LIGHTS GO ON IN A THOUSAND OFFICES AGAINST THE TWILIGHT SKY 
THE THRUSTING TOWERS OF MANHATTAN 
BECOME A SIGHT LIKE NOTHING ELSE ON EARTH 
HAVING SOME OF THE PRESUMED RADIANCE OF AN ALADDIN'S CAVE 
SOMETHING OF THE MISTY SUSPENDED MAGIC OF AN UNDERWATER SEASCAPE 
AND AN UNEARTHLY GRANDEUR OF SCALE 
THAT SUGGESTS A FANTASY OF HELL OR AN ANGULAR HEAVEN 
THE STARS OF THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD 
WERE THE AD MEN OF MADISON AVENUE 
PEOPLE LIKE GEORGE LOIS 
WHO ON THE FIRST JANUARY NINETEEN SIXTY 
OPENED A NEW AD AGENCY ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH FLOOR OF THE SEAGRAM BUILDING 
THE MOST SPECTACULAR EXAMPLE OF THE NEW MODERN OFFICE BLOCK 
I WAS THE ONLY GUY EVER IN THIS BUSINESS 
WHO PROMISED I WOULD DO A CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD KNOCK AMERICA ON ITS ASS 
IMMEDIATELY I MEAN THE NEXT MORNING 
IF IT WASN'T THE NEXT MORNING I'D SAY WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED 
ENSCONCED IN THEIR TOWERS OF GLASS AND STEEL 
AND BUTTRESSED BY THEIR OWN SUPREME SELF CONFIDENCE 
AD MEN LIKE LOIS ADDRESSED CORPORATE AMERICA ON EQUAL TERMS 
TRADING ON THEIR INSIDE TRACK 
TO THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE AMERICAN CONSUMER 
IF I GOT AN IDEA AND I GOT IT AND I UNDERSTOOD IT 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS HIP OR WHATEVER THE WORD IS 
I THINK THE REST OF AMERICA WOULD GET IT 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT THEY WERE XEROX WAS AN ANTIFREEZE 
SAM WILL YOU PLEASE GO MAKE A COPY OF THIS 
I GOT THE ACCOUNT I WENT TO THEM AND I WANTED TO DO A T. V. COMMERCIAL 
AND HUH WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
I SAID YOU CAN BE FAMOUS TOMORROW MORNING WITH ONE COMMERCIAL 
THANK YOU SAM THAT WAS FAST 
THAT SAYS EVEN A MONKEY CAN DO IT 
AND WHAT HAPPENED LITERALLY IS 
THEIR FIFTEEN YEAR PLAN WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN SIX MONTHS 
WHICH ONE'S THE ORIGINAL 
BY NINETEEN SIXTY WHAT YOU'VE REALLY SEEN IS THE EMERGENCE OF THE AD MAN AS 
BUT CERTAINLY AS SOMEONE WHO HAD BECOME CENTRAL TO THE WAY 
AMERICANS THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT CONSUMER SOCIETY LOOKED LIKE 
AND CERTAINLY WHAT THEY THOUGHT CAPITALISM LOOKED LIKE 
I THINK THE ADVERTISING MAN IS IN A CERTAIN SENSE UNIQUE BECAUSE 
HE'S PART ARTIST PART BUSINESSMAN PART SCIENTIST I GUESS 
HE'S KIND OF THE EMBODIMENT OF THIS NEW ETHOS 
THE NEW MAN THAT SORT OF YOUNG HIP 
I'M SAYING WE SHOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER LIGHT EFFECT 
THE IDEA OF MADISON AVENUE AS A KIND OF LOCATION 
LIKE THIS WAS THE PLACE TO BE 
THIS IS WHERE EVERYTHING IMPORTANT IS HAPPENING 
GOD I'M TRIPPING THROUGH THE DAISIES 
ADVERTISING WAS SUDDENLY SEEN AS THE MOST POWERFUL THE MOST LUCRATIV 
AND FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD THE SEXIEST BUSINESS AROUND 
ROLL 
THESE ADVERTISING MEN SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES 
IN A KIND OF ICONIC POSITION IN AMERICAN CULTURE 
AND THE AMERICAN IMAGINATION AS THEY NEVER HAD BEEN BEFORE 
INTRODUCING CHICKEN TETRAZZINI AND LASAGNE 
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S THE CAST OF LA DOLCE VITA 
HE WAS THE QUINTESSENTIAL NEW AMERICAN 
HE WAS THE NEW POST WAR AMERICAN 
INTRODUCING LASAGNE SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S AN ITALIAN OPERA 
DARK SUITS THIN TIES WHITE SHIRTS 
A WHOLE LINGO LANGUAGE THAT EVERYBODY SPOKE 
LET'S START WITH CHICKEN TETRAZZINI 
RUN IT UP THE FLAGPOLE AND SEE WHO SALUTES 
THROW IT AGAINST THE WALL AND SEE WHAT STICKS 
WHERE'S CHICKEN TETRAZZINI FROM COULD BE BROOKLYN FOR ALL I KNOW 
THEY LIVED IN THE SUBURBS 
AND SPECIFICALLY IN WESTCHESTER AND CONNECTICUT 
THE MORE UPPER CLASS SUBURBS OF NEW YORK 
PLACES LIKE WEST PORT CONNECTICUT 
THAT WAS THE ONE THAT ALL THE CREATIVE GUYS LIVED IN 
MAD MAGAZINE USED TO MOCK THE FIVE OH FOUR TO WEST PORT 
YOU KNOW THEY ALL HAD TO CATCH THE FIVE OH FOUR TO WEST PORT 
AND HAVE THEIR MARTINI IN THE TRAIN 
THERE WAS SPORTIVENESS IN THE AIR 
THE MEN WERE INTO LOOKING GOOD WEARING GREAT SUITS 
DRINKING TWO OR THREE MARTINIS AT LUNCH 
YOU HAD THESE GOOD LOOKING YOUNG WOMEN 
NOT LONG REMOVED FROM UNIVERSITIES WORKING IN ADVERTISING AGENCIES 
THEY WERE NOT WORKING IN THE NEWSPAPER PROFESSION 
I AS A NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER RARELY SAW AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN 
BUT THEY WERE IN ADVERTISING 
AND THEY REPRESENTED GLAMOUR AS FAR AS THE WORKING WOMAN WAS CONCERNED 
HELLO AMIGOS I'M CHIQUITA BANANA 
I WAS THE CHIQUITA BANANA GIRL 
YOU KNOW WE'D DO CARTOONS AND COMIC BOOKS OR WHATEVER 
SELLING THINGS AND WE WERE SELLING CHIQUITA BANANAS 
YOU CAN PUT THEM IN A SALAD 
ADVERTISING TO ME WAS SO IDENTIFIED WITH COMEDY 
OR SPRIGHTLINESS OR CHEERFULNESS 
AND NOTHING PARTICULARLY SERIOUS 
THAT IT REACHED ME BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS SORT OF A NUT 
SO I LOVED DOING IT I KNEW I WAS A GOOD WRITER 
I'D BEEN WRITING SINCE WAY BACK IN CHILDHOOD 
AND IT JUST SEEMED LIKE A LIVELY HAPPY PLACE 
YOU JUST HAD TO KIND OF KEEP AWAY FROM THE GUYS 
AT LEAST I DID I WAS CUTE IN THOSE DAYS 
SO THEY USED TO KNOCK ON MY CUBICLE SO TO SPEAK 
YOU WANNA HAVE LUNCH NO 
THIS IS THE MAIN DINING ROOM CALLED THE POOL ROOM OF THE FOUR SEASONS 
YOU'D GET THE GUNS HERE YOU KNOW 
EDITORIAL PEOPLE 
BUSINESS PEOPLE IMPORTANT CITY PEOPLE 
ALL THE SHAKERS AND MOVERS OF NEW YORK ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE 
I ATE LUNCH HERE FOR FORTY YEARS 
EVERY DAY 
NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY TWO TIMES 
THERE WAS HEDONISM 
ADVERTISING WAS VERY MUCH AN INDUSTRY 
THAT IMBUED A GREAT DEAL OF HEDONISM WITHIN THE WORKFORCE 
WITHIN THE HOURS OF WORK 
THERE WAS A LOT OF FUN AND GAMES A LOT OF HANKY PANKY 
TO EASE THE PRESSURE OF GETTING THE JOB DONE 
THERE WAS ONE GUY WHO HAD A BARBER'S CHAIR IN HIS OFFICE 
AND HE USED TO BOAST 
HOW HE COULD PICK UP WOMEN IN THE ELEVATOR AT NOON TIME 
GET THEM INTO HIS BARBER'S CHAIR AND HAVE A REALLY DELIGHTFUL TIME 
BEFORE TWO O'CLOCK EVEN ROLLED AROUND AND WORK STARTED 
ONE AGENCY OPENED A BAR 
AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS CALL YOUR WIFE AND TELL HER 
I'VE GOT THIS DEADLINE AND JUST BEEN SLAMMERED BY THIS ACCOUNT MAN 
AND I GOTTA GET IT OUT TOMORROW 
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY IN SOME HOTEL ROOM SOMEWHERE 
BUT IT WASN'T ALL FUN AND GAMES ON THE AVENUE 
LIKE THE REST OF AMERICA IN NINETEEN SIXTY 
THE AD BUSINESS WAS GOING THROUGH A PERIOD OF RAPID CHANGE 
AND A RECONSIDERATION OF WHAT IT WAS THERE FOR 
THE JOKE AMONG AD MEN WAS IF WE HAD A SOUL WE'D BE SEARCHING IT 
I THINK THE BUSINESS IS POPULATED BY A LOT OF PHONEY 
FREELOADING SECOND GUESSERS 
THERE'S A NEW CEREAL THAT TASTES SO RIGHT 
MAKES YOU DANCE IT'S WAY OUT OF SIGHT 
WHO COULDN'T MAKE IT IN CERTAIN OTHER FIELDS 
IT'S TASTY LITTLE SQUARES OF MALTED WHEAT 
AND HAVE RETREATED TO THIS 
WHERE TALK IS CHEAP AND ABLE TO GET BY ON A LOT OF NOTHING 
IT'S CRISPY AND IT'S CRUNCHY AND IT TASTES SO NEAT 
FASTER THOUGH I'M SINGING IT SLOWLY ACTUALLY 
ANTIPATHY BETWEEN THE CREATIVE PEOPLE AND THE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVES 
WE CANNOT CAST HIM AS THE PROBLEM CHARACTER 
HE IS ABSOLUTELY TOO GOOD LOOKING 
OH COME ON WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FIGHT 
THEY WERE SO RIGID AND TIED TO SCHEDULES 
AND THEIR ASSES WERE ALL ON THE LINE 
AND THE CREATIVES 
WHO WANTED TO DO BRILLIANT WONDERFUL FABULOUS THINGS 
HE COULD DELIVER THE PRODUCT SELL BEAUTIFULLY 
BUT YOU CANNOT HAVE THE GUY WITH THE PROBLEM BE THE OTHER YOU'VE GOT 
THAT WAS THE ONLY UM 
SCRATCHY PART OF THE OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS 
WHENEVER YOU'RE NEAR I HIDE MY TEARS 
BEHIND A PAINTED SMILE 
AT THE ROOT OF ALL THIS SCRATCHINESS WAS THE AMERICAN CONSUMER 
A FAR HARDER NUT TO CRACK NOW THAN IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
AD MEN LIVED OR DIED BY THEIR ABILITY TO KNOW WHAT AMERICA WANTED 
BUT AFTER DECADES OF BEING SOLD TO 
CONSUMERS WERE GETTING WISE TO EVERY MOVE IN THE MADISON AVENUE PLAYBOOK 
MEET THE HAPPY CLICHES IN A TYPICAL FAMILY SITUATION 
KNEE DEEP IN TOGETHERNESS 
YOU CAN ALWAYS SPOT THE CLICHES BY THEIR TRADEMARK 
THE TOOTHY SMILE 
MRS. CLICHE IS ALWAYS FOUND IN THE KITCHEN NEXT TO A WASHING MACHINE 
HER UNIFORM SHIRT WAIST DRESS HALF APRON SMILE 
GOOD MORNING 
ONE WAY TO KEEP CONSUMERS ON SIDE 
WAS BY WORKING OUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANTED THROUGH RESEARCH 
WITH LIGHT HELD CONSTANT 
YOU GET CHANGES IN THE CONSTRICTION AND DILATION OF THE PUPIL OF THE EYE 
WHICH CORRELATE TO THE EMOTIONAL VALUE 
OR THE INTEREST WITH WHICH PEOPLE VIEW VISUAL OR HEAR AUDITORY STIMULI 
WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT MALE RESPONDENTS 
AND WE PURPOSELY ONLY TESTED MALE RESPONDENTS 
HAD A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN PUPIL RESPONSE IN THIS PARTICULAR SEGMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL 
THE DOCTOR STRANGELOVE OF THE MADISON AVENUE BOFFINS 
WAS ERNST DICHTER THE INVENTOR OF MOTIVATIONAL RESEARCH 
ERNST DICHTER THE VIENNESE PSYCHOANALYST 
WHO COMES TO THE UNITED STATES 
AND TURNS HIMSELF INTO THE GREAT MAGICIAN OF THE CONSUMER ECONOMY 
BY REALLY AT LEAST IN HIS MIND WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS 
FIGURING OUT WHY AMERICANS REALLY WANTED TO BUY THINGS 
AND THEREFORE ALLOWING CORPORATIONS TO TAILOR THEIR PRODUCTS 
OR TAILOR THEIR ADVERTISING 
TO APPEAL TO THE DEEPEST DESIRES OF AMERICANS 
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS TRY A COUPLE OF THESE SALAD DRESSINGS 
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK THIS IS 
THIS WOULD BE THE COMPROMISE FOR A WOMAN FEELING CREATIVE 
I THINK THAT IT HAS A PLACE IN OUR AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE 
HE WAS A THERAPIST 
HE SAW IN AMERICANS THIS LONG TRADITION OF PURITANISM 
OR A PURITANICAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS CONSUMER CULTURE 
SO HE OFFERED A VISION OF A CONSUMER CULTURE 
THAT WAS ANTI PURITANICAL 
MODERN MAN QUITE OFTEN TRIES TO WORK OFF HIS FRUSTRATIONS 
BY SPENDING ON SELF GRATIFICATION 
MODERN MAN IS ETERNALLY READY TO FILL OUT HIS SELF IMAGE 
BY PURCHASING PRODUCTS WHICH COMPLEMENT IT 
DICHTER THROUGH ADVERTISING 
WOULD HELP AMERICANS OVERCOME THIS REPRESSION 
AND INDULGE THEMSELVES FULLY IN A SEXUALISED CONSUMER CULTURE 
I THINK OF DICHTER MOSTLY AS A CRANK 
YOU KNOW THE EXAMPLES ARE HILARIOUS BECAUSE 
MAYBE THEY'RE HILARIOUS COS THEY'RE TRUE 
WELL THERE'S THE CAR I TOLD YOU ABOUT 
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT IT FROM HERE FOR A MINUTE 
DO YOU LIKE IT 
YEAH IT'S SURE SMOOTH THAT CAR'S GOT SCAT 
HE NOTICED THAT MEN CAME INTO THE AUTOMOBILE SHOWROOM 
AND LEANED UP AGAINST A CONVERTIBLE BUT THEN BOUGHT THE SEDAN 
AND THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH MEN AND WOMEN 
WHAT HE LEARNED WAS THAT MEN THOUGHT OF THE CONVERTIBLE AS THEIR MISTRESS 
THE LINES OF THE CAR ARE PLENTY SMOOTH THEY'RE EXTRA SOFT 
ON THE OTHER HAND THE SEDAN WAS THEIR WIFE 
YOU SAID YESTERDAY MRS. JONES 
THAT YOU TAKE YOUR SISTER'S LITTLE BOY OUT FOR RIDES IN THE CAR 
AND HE THEN DEVELOPED FROM THAT TWO RECOMMENDATIONS 
ONE WAS THAT SHOWROOMS BE DESIGNED 
TO HIGHLIGHT THE PRESENCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE 
AND THE OTHER ONE WAS TO DEVELOP A COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN A CONVERTIBLE AND A SEDAN 
SO MEN COULD FANTASISE ABOUT A MISTRESS 
AND HAVE THE COMFORT OF THEIR WIVES 
THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT ERNEST IS MISSING A BIG POINT 
THE POINT WAS THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO SELL A CAR 
FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVED THAT ADVERTISING WAS MORE ART THAN SCIENCE 
THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM OF THE WISED UP CONSUMER 
WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A CREATIVE REVOLUTION 
AND THE BANNER OF REVOLUTION WOULD FIRST BE RAISED 
IN THE PAGES OF LIFE MAGAZINE 
LIFE MAGAZINE WAS THE NEWS OF THE WEEK 
YOU COULD SEE THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS 
IN BLACK AND WHITE AND COLOUR 
THAT HAPPENED IN THE WORLD IN THAT WEEK 
LIFE HAD PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO THEY WOULD SEND OUT TO MAKE THESE ESSAYS 
THEY WOULD BRING BACK SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY PERSONAL 
IT WAS THEIR TAKE ON IT 
IT WAS TELEVISION BEFORE TELEVISION WAS AS POWERFUL 
AND FAR REACHING AS IT IS RIGHT NOW 
OH YEAH LIFE WAS IT THAT'S WHERE YOU WANTED TO RUN YOUR ADVERTISING 
YOU GOT ADS IN LIFE THAT WAS HOT SHIT 
THAT WAS THE ULTIMATE 
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT LIFE MAGAZINE THAT WAS SO GREAT WAS THE SPACE 
IT'S A LITTLE BILLBOARD IN YOUR HAND 
SO YOU COULD HAVE THESE GIANT ADS 
AND THEY PAID A PRETTY PENNY FOR THESE SPACES TOO 
LIFE MAY HAVE PROVIDED THE PERFECT FRAME FOR ADVERTISING 
BUT THE THINGS THAT WERE GOING IN THE FRAME 
WERE GIVING SOME AD MEN HEARTBURN 
MOST ADVERTISING IN LOOKING AT MOST OF IT 
IT WAS WHAT I CALLED A HOMOGENISED BLUR 
YOU COULDN'T DIFFERENTIATE 
IT JUST WASN'T THERE TO BE DIFFERENTIATED 
AND THERE WAS A HUGE PROBLEM OF SAMENESS 
AND THE SAMENESS LED TO ONE OTHER THING WHICH YOU COULD DIE FROM IT 
WAS BOREDOM 
WHAT CAME BEFORE THE CREATIVE REVOLUTION WAS COPY HEAVY 
WHILE THERE WERE VISUALS 
USUALLY THE VISUALS WERE DIMINISHED BY THE COPY 
THE COPYWRITER WOULD WRITE A LARGE HUNK OF COPY 
THE ART DIRECTOR WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING IT FIT 
HE WAS A LAYOUT PERSON BASICALLY 
YOU CAN'T SAY IT DOESN'T CATCH YOUR EYE 
IT'S A BIG JUICY DOUBLE SPREAD 
BUT LOOK 
THE GUY HAS TO GO HUNTING TO HAVE A REASON TO DRIVE OFF THE ROAD 
AND HE BRINGS HIS WIFE WITH HIM WHO'S ACTUALLY TELLING HIM 
HEY YOU IDIOT OVER THERE CAN'T YOU SEE THE PHEASANT 
WHERE HONEY WHERE 
MY HEAD'S STILL SPINNING FROM THE 
FORGET ABOUT THE CONTENT FORGET ABOUT THE BIG IDEA 
AS YOU TURN THE PAGE YOU'RE YAWNING 
WOW 
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF CONVENTIONAL ADVERTISING 
HALLELUIAH 
LEMON 
THIS VOLKSWAGEN MISSED THE BOAT 
THE CHROME STRIP ON THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT IS BLEMISHED 
AND MUST BE REPLACED 
THINK SMALL 
OUR LITTLE CAR ISN'T SO MUCH OF A NOVELTY ANY MORE 
THE GUY AT THE GAS STATION DOESN'T ASK WHERE THE GAS GOES 
NOBODY EVEN STARES AT OUR SHAPE 
THAT LITTLE TINY CAR LEMON THINK SMALL 
NOBODY DARED TO DO THAT 
Y. AND AMP R. HAD CHRYSLER AND WE WERE DOING BORING ADVERTISING 
WITH COLOURFUL CARS WITH DOGS AND CATS 
AND WOMEN RUNNING AROUND YOU KNOW ETC 
NEVER 
WE'D NO SOONER MAKE AN OVER CHROMED TWO TONE VOLKSWAGEN 
THAN WE'D CHANGE THE CLASSIC BEETLE SHAPE 
IT'S NOT THAT THE CHROMED VERSION LOOKS SO BAD 
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE THE CAR WORK ANY BETTER 
YOU KNOW NOBODY WANTED A SMALL CAR 
AND ALONG COMES A CAR THAT'S SMALL SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY 
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IN REVERSE IT SAYS THINK SMALL 
KIND OF EVERYBODY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS WITH THE BUG 
THE SPARK THAT IGNITED THE CREATIVE REVOLUTION 
WAS STRUCK BY BILL BERNBACH OF THE AGENCY DOYLE DANE BERNBACH 
YOU GO INTO AN AMERICAN SUBWAY AND WATCH PEOPLE READING MAGAZINES 
AND FLIPPING THROUGH THESE PAGES AT FIFTY THOUSAND A CLIP 
AND YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND 
WHEN I SAY THAT YOU ARE VERY PRACTICAL 
IF YOU HAVE THE ARTISTRY TO STOP PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM LOOK 
I WANNA SHOOT IT IN PARIS THAT'D BE WILD 
DISPENSING WITH TRADITIONAL HIERARCHIES 
BERNBACH TEAMED ART DIRECTORS WITH COPYWRITERS 
AND PUT THEM ON EQUAL TERMS 
WHAT BERNBACH DID IS HE SAID HEY THE GRAPHIC GUY 
THE ART DIRECTOR IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE WRITER 
AND THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING 
BILL BERNBACH SAID O. K. CREATE 
DEVELOP SOMETHING THAT HADN'T BEEN DEVELOPED BEFORE 
MAKE ART OUT OF THIS COMMERCE 
AND GO UP TO THE LINE 
DON'T GO OVER THE LINE IT CAN'T BE INACCESSIBLE 
BUT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT CHALLENGES THE VIEWER'S SENSIBILITY 
MAKES THE VIEWER FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PART OF THE ADVERTISEMENT 
INSTEAD OF JUST BEING HAWKED TO 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE GEORGE LOIS HAD GONE TO THE VOLKSWAGEN PLANT IN GERMANY 
TO GET IDEAS FOR A NEW CAMPAIGN 
WE CAME BACK AND I'M WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY AND I SEE BILL BERNBACH 
THE GREAT BILL BERNBACH 
AND HE SAYS GEORGE AND I SAID I GOT IT 
HE SAID YOU GOT THE ADVERTISING 
I SAID NO I DON'T HAVE THE ADVERTISING 
BUT I'VE GOT THE MARKETING PROBLEM FIGURED OUT 
HE SAID WHAT'S THAT 
I SAID BILL WE HAVE TO SELL A NAZI CAR IN A JEWISH TOWN 
HOW DO YOU SELL A NAZI CAR IN A JEWISH TOWN 
WELL THEY MANAGED TO DO THAT 
AND THEY MANAGED TO DO IT THROUGH WIT AND IRONY 
AND DOING SOMETHING THAT ADVERTISING CLIENTS WERE AFRAID TO DO 
HOW COULD YOU MAKE FUN OF SOMETHING 
WE WERE THE NEW KIDS IN TOWN 
WE WEREN'T THE ESTABLISHMENT WE WEREN'T THE W. A. S. P. Y. 
FAKE SONS OF BITCHES WHO GET THEIR ACCOUNTS PLAYING GOLF 
YOU STARTED GETTING THE ETHNIC NEIGHBOURHOOD KIDS 
GOING TO ART SCHOOL 
YOUNG ITALIAN GUYS AND IRISH GUYS AND JEWISH KIDS 
AND SUDDENLY THEY WERE BURSTING OUT OF THESE ART SCHOOLS 
AND THEY WERE BRINGING THEIR PRACTICAL EDUCATION 
TO THE ADVERTISING WORLD 
THEY WERE MORE BOISTEROUS THEY WERE LOUDER THEY WERE MORE FUNNY 
YOU GET DOYLE DANE BERNBACH 
I MEAN IT'S AN IRISHMAN AND A JEWISH GUY 
AND YOU GET SCALI MCCABE AND SLOVES 
AN IRISHMAN AN ITALIAN AND A JEWISH GUY 
IT'S LIKE THEY SUDDENLY STARTED BECOMING MORE ETHNIC AND TOUGHER 
I WENT IN WITH THE PUNCH IN THE MOUTH ADVERTISING 
IT WAS CALLED STREET TALK 
IT WAS NEW YORK 
IT WAS THE VOICE OF NEW YORK 
YOU'RE SOME TOMATO WE COULD MAKE BEAUTIFUL BLOODY MARYS TOGETHER 
I'M DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OTHER FELLAS 
I LIKE YOU WOLFSCHMIDT 
YOU'VE GOT TASTE 
WHEN I DID THAT SEXY STUFF WITH THE WOLFSCHMIDT 
WITH THE BOTTLE LOOKING LIKE IT WAS GONNA HAVE SEX WITH THE ORANGE 
YOU SWEET DOLL I APPRECIATE YOU I'VE GOT TASTE 
I'LL BRING OUT THE REAL ORANGE IN YOU 
I'LL MAKE YOU FAMOUS KISS ME 
WHO WAS THAT TOMATO I SAW YOU WITH LAST WEEK 
THAT'S WITTY SWEET FUNNY STUFF AND THAT CHANGED THE 
AND THAT STUFF WOULD GET PICKED UP BY THE JOHNNY CARSONS OF THE WORLD 
AND THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT IT AND SHOW IT AND REFLECT ON IT 
WHO ARE YOU CALLING A TOMATO 
WOLFSCHMIDT IS MINE HE'S GOT TASTE 
OF COURSE HE HAS TASTE 
WASN'T HE WITH ME LAST NIGHT 
LOOK AT ME WOLFSCHMIDT YOU KNOW YOUR ONIONS 
LET'S MAKE GREAT MARTINIS TOGETHER 
WHAT DOLLS IF ONLY I WASN'T HAVING A DRINK WITH THAT LEMON TONIGHT 
THE BIG IDEA ADVERTISING THE CREATIVE REVOLUTION ADVERTISING 
THEY WANTED TO VIRALLY GET INTO THE CULTURE 
WE NOW CALL IT VIRAL ADVERTISING 
IT'S SUPPOSEDLY A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING BUT IT'S NOT REALLY 
BUT THEY WOULD CREATE SLOGANS THEY WOULD CREATE JINGLES 
THEY WOULD CREATE AN AESTHETIC THAT BECAME PART OF THE CULTURE 
SO THAT WHAT YOU DID ON A DAILY BASIS 
WAS SOMEHOW INFLUENCED BY THE ADVERTISING 
I UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE AND I UNDERSTAND HOW TO GO AHEAD OF THE CULTURE 
I UNDERSTAND HOW TO PULL THE CULTURE WITH ME 
OF COURSE REMEMBER THERE'S AN INHERENT BEAUTY IN SOUP CANS 
THAT MICHELANGELO COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED EXISTED 
TALKATIVE ANDY WARHOL AND GABBY SONNY LISTON ALWAYS FLY BRANIFF 
I USED TO SAY I WANNA BE THIRTEEN WEEKS AHEAD OF 
I ONLY WANNA BE THIRTEEN WEEKS AHEAD OF THE CULTURE 
WHICH WAS THE LENGTH OF A T. V. CYCLE YOU KNOW 
I DO NOT WANNA BE LEONARDO D. A. VINCI WHO WAS A REAL DUMMY 
COS THINK ABOUT IT THREE HUNDRED YEARS AHEAD OF HIS TIME 
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT 
THANKS FOR FLYING BRANIFF FELLAS' 
WHEN YOU GOT IT FLAUNT IT 
THIS NOTION OF GETTING IT 
IS IT'S LIKE HIPSTER INSIDE STUFF 
JAZZ YOU KNOW YOU GET IT OR YOU DON'T GET IT 
CERTAIN KIND OF JOKES YOU GET OR YOU DON'T GET 
PAINTING YOU GET IT OR YOU DON'T GET IT 
YOU'RE IN OR YOU'RE OUT YOU'RE COOL OR YOU'RE SQUARE 
THE ADVERTISING WAS SAYING TO PEOPLE 
THERE ARE SOME OF YOU OUT THERE WHO ARE GONNA UNDERSTAND THIS 
AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU THESE CLUES AND YOU'RE GONNA ENJOY IT 
THEN THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE PROBABLY THE MASS BUT WHO KNOWS 
WHO ARE NOT BUT THEY'LL COME ALONG BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS 
THEY'LL BE LEMMINGS AND THEY'LL FOLLOW THE LEADER 
WHAT 
I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT AD MEN CHANGED EVERYTHING 
I THINK IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE PART AND PARCEL 
OF THE BROADER CULTURAL SHIFTS THAT ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO HAPPEN 
WHAT 
THE SENSE OF THERE'S A WHOLE AUDIENCE OUT THERE 
THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WAS OUT THERE AND IT REALLY WAS 
THAT KIND OF HIP NESS AND AWARENESS IS HOW THE CULTURE ADVANCES 
CHEESE 
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY 
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SIXTIES 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY PUT THE PRESSURE ON THE PEDAL 
TO MAKE THIS IDEA OF GETTING IT BECOME PART OF THE INSIDER'S LINE 
AND ADVERTISING IS REALLY THE ENGINE OF THAT IT CREATED IT 
WHAT WHAT 
YOU KNOW THERE ARE PERIODS WHEN IDEAS ARE FALLOW 
THERE'S A KIND OF NOTHING HAPPENING FOR A WHILE 
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO MAKE A MOVE 
AND THEN FINALLY IT JUST BURSTS AND THE SIXTIES WAS 
FROM WHAT I COULD EXPERIENCE AS MY COMING OF AGE 
THAT WAS A BURSTING TIME 
BUT DESPITE ALL THE OPTIMISM AND POSITIVE ENERGY OF THE PERIOD 
NAGGING DOUBTS WERE NEVER FAR FROM THE SURFACE 
EVERYONE HAD THEIR OWN PERSONAL BUGBEAR 
THE POPULATION EXPLOSION JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 
POLLUTION NUCLEAR ARMAGEDDON 
IN THE MIDST OF PLENTY THERE SEEMED TO BE AN ECHOING EMPTINESS 
EVEN THE USUALLY UPBEAT TIME MAGAZINE 
CAUGHT THE GENERAL MOOD OF UNEASE IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE 
ANXIETY SEEMS TO BE THE DOMINANT FACT OF MODERN LIFE 
IT SHOUTS IN THE HEADLINES LAUGHS NERVOUSLY AT COCKTAIL PARTIES 
NAGS FROM ADVERTISEMENTS SPEAKS SUAVELY IN THE BOARD ROOM 
AND WHISPERS IN THE PRIVACY EACH DAY BEFORE THE SHAVING MIRROR 
AND THE DRESSING TABLE 
ALMOST ANY INNOCENT EVERYDAY ACT BETRAYS ANXIETY 
THE LIMP OR OVER HEARTY HANDSHAKE 
THE SECOND PACK OF CIGARETTES OR THE THIRD MARTINI 
THE FORGOTTEN APPOINTMENT 
THE WASTED HOUR BEFORE THE T. V. SET 
THE NEW CAR UNPAID FOR 
IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT AMERICA HAD TALKED ITSELF INTO IT 
SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES A SERIES OF SCATHING STUDIES 
OF THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE HAD BECOME NATIONAL BESTSELLERS 
IT WAS A BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES IN PRINT FORM 
GALBRAITH'S AFFLUENT SOCIETY TOUCHES ON THIS ANXIETY 
ABOUT A WORLD IN WHICH PRIVATE AFFLUENCE IS JUXTAPOSED TO PUBLIC SQUALOR 
THE HIDDEN PERSUADERS WAS AN EXPOSE OF THE METHODS 
THAT ADVERTISERS WERE USING TO TRICK AMERICANS INTO BUYING THINGS 
THE LONELY CROWD IS NOW WE'RE IN A WORLD WHERE 
MEN ARE OBSESSED WITH WHAT PEOPLE AROUND THEM THINK 
THEY WANNA LOOK GOOD IN THE EYES OF OTHERS 
STATUS SEEKERS SHOWED THE WAY IN WHICH ADVERTISERS DEVELOP PRODUCTS 
THAT WOULD INTENSIFY AMERICANS' SENSE OF STATUS 
AND GET THEM TO ACHIEVE A HIGHER STATUS THROUGH CONSUMER CULTURE 
JOHN KEATS' CRACK IN THE PICTURE WINDOW IS A KIND OF INDICTMENT 
OF THE FRESH AIR SLUMS OF SUBURBIA 
CONCEIVED IN GREED NURTURED IN ERROR 
WASTE MAKERS IS REALLY THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF VERY IMPORTANT BOOKS 
THAT AWAKEN AMERICANS TO THE DANGERS OF CONSUMER CULTURE TO THE ENVIRONMENT 
ORGANISATION MAN IS ABOUT HOW WE'RE NOT INDIVIDUALISTIC ENOUGH 
DON'T THINK ENOUGH EVERYONE'S OBSESSED 
WITH HOW THEY LOOK IN THE EYES OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS 
TOGETHER THESE BOOKS OFFER A TRENCHANT POWERFUL 
AND VERY INFLUENTIAL CRITIQUE OF A COUNTRY THAT WAS LOSING ITS MOORINGS 
THAT WAS NO LONGER ADHERING TO A SENSE OF SELF RESTRAINT 
WHERE HARD WORK HAD BEEN UNDERMINED AND WHERE PEOPLE WERE 
WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MADISON AVENUE 
WERE CHASING THE FALSE GODS OF CONSUMER CULTURE 
BEAT POET ALLEN GINSBERG HAD SEEN IT ALL COMING 
IN HIS NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE VISION OF AN AMERICA IN THRALL TO THE IDOL OF CONSUMERISM 
THAT HE CALLED MOLOCH 
MOLOCH MOLOCH NIGHTMARE OF MOLOCH 
MOLOCH THE LOVELESS MENTAL MOLOCH 
MOLOCH THE HEAVY JUDGER OF MEN 
MOLOCH WHOSE EYES ARE A THOUSAND BLIND WINDOWS 
MOLOCH WHOSE SKYSCRAPERS STAND IN THE LONG STREETS 
LIKE ENDLESS JEHOVAHS 
MOLOCH WHOSE FACTORIES DREAM AND CROAK IN THE FOG 
MOLOCH WHOSE SMOKESTACKS AND ANTENNAE CROWN THE CITIES 
MOLOCH MOLOCH ROBOT APARTMENTS 
INVISIBLE SUBURBS 
SKELETON TREASURIES 
BLIND CAPITALS 
DEMONIC INDUSTRIES SPECTRAL NATIONS 
INVINCIBLE MAD HOUSES GRANITE COCKS 
MONSTROUS BOMBS 
VISIONS OMENS HALLUCINATIONS 
MIRACLES ECSTASIES 
GONE DOWN THE AMERICAN RIVER 
DREAMS ABERRATIONS 
ILLUMINATIONS RELIGIONS 
THE WHOLE BOATLOAD OF SENSITIVE BULLSHIT 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO IT SEEMED AS IF MOLOCH HAD MATERIALISED IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN 
IN THE SHAPE OF A TWENTY FIVE MILLION SQUARE FOOT FIFTY EIGHT STOREY HIGH RISE 
IT WAS ONLY FOUR YEARS 
SINCE THE ELEGANT IDEALISTIC SEAGRAM BUILDING HAD OPENED 
BUT THIS NEW BUILDING CONVEYED A VERY DIFFERENT MESSAGE ABOUT THE FUTURE 
THE OPTIMISM THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED THE EARLY SIXTIES BEGAN TO SOUR FAIRLY QUICKLY 
I THINK ONE GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE PAN AM BUILDING 
IT WAS DESPISED 
THERE WAS NO ONE WHO HAD A GOOD WORD FOR IT 
SOME HATED IT MORE SOME LESS BUT NO ONE LIKED IT 
IT WAS JUST A DISASTER 
IT CLOSED OFF WHAT HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LOVELIEST VIEWS IN NEW YORK 
THE VIEW DOWN PARK AVENUE 
IT WAS SEEN AS A DEEPLY ANTI SOCIAL KIND OF BUILDING 
WHICH WAS IRONIC BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN DESIGNED IN PART AT LEAST 
BY ONE OF THE MASTERS OF THE MODERN MOVEMENT WALTER GROPIUS 
GROPIUS HAD FOUNDED THE BAUHAUS AND ONE THING THE BAUHAUS STOOD FOR 
WAS FOR SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ARCHITECTURE 
AND HERE HE WAS BUILDING THE MOST SOCIALLY IRRESPONSIBLE BUILDING BEING BUILT ON THE PLANET 
AND IT WAS LIKE WHAT GIVES WALTER 
AND THE ANSWER WAS IT WAS ALL HYPOCRISY 
THIS KIND OF SOCIAL MISSION TO THIS MODERN ARCHITECTURE 
WAS REALLY TURNING OUT TO BE JUST AN ENVELOPE A STYLE OF ENVELOPE 
FOR THESE MASSIVE NEW COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES 
AND IT DID THEN IN A WAY SAY SOMETHING LARGER 
WHICH WAS THAT THIS STYLISH NEW OPTIMISTIC ARCHITECTURE 
THAT HAD EMERGED IN PARK AVENUE IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES 
JUST SEEMED TO BE A SYMBOL OF HOPE AND OPTIMISM AND THIS NEW CIVIL SOCIETY AND GLOBAL ECONOMY 
AND ALL THIS STUFF IT WAS NONSENSE IT WAS JUST THE SIDE EFFECT 
THESE WERE BIG MASSIVE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENTS 
BUILT TO BE THE HOMES OF ENORMOUS WORLD SHAKING WORLD SHAPING CORPORATE COMPANIES 
WHICH EXISTED TO PLEASE THEIR SHAREHOLDERS 
AND KEEP THEIR STOCK PRICES UP AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY 
AND THAT'S ALL THIS ECONOMY WAS ABOUT 
THIS WAS A KIND OF A JUGGERNAUT MOVING THROUGH THE WORLD THAT WAS GOING TO DO WHAT IT WAS GOING TO DO 
SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT LIKE WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE 
OTHER TIMES YOU WOULDN'T 
BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
AND I THINK THAT WAS A KIND OF A SPLASH IN THE FACE FOR PEOPLE 
WHO REALISED THAT OH GEE WHAT IS THIS NEW WORLD THAT WE'RE CREATING 
HERE COMES THE PRESIDENT 
THOUGH WE KNOW THAT YOU DON'T WEAR A HAT 
NOVEMBER TWENTY SECOND HE WOKE UP IN FORT WORTH 
AND HE HAD THIS LUNCHEON AT THE FORT WORTH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
HE WAS PRESENTED THIS SHADY OAKS COWBOY HAT WHICH WAS THEIR BIG TRADITION 
COULDN'T LET YOU LEAVE FORT WORTH WITHOUT PROVIDING YOU WITH SOME PROTECTION AGAINST THE RAIN 
AND TWO THOUSAND TEXANS THERE HOWL FOR HIM TO PUT IT ON 
I'LL PUT IT ON IN THE WHITE HOUSE ON MONDAY 
IF YOU COME UP THERE YOU'LL HAVE THE CHANCE TO SEE IT THERE 
THERE WAS NO MONDAY FOR HIM
