GOOD AFTERNOON WE HAVE BEEN 
WATCHING RONNIE O'SULLIVAN INSIDE 
THE CRUCIBLE ARENA SINCE HE FIRST 
TURNED UP AND AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD IN 
NINETEEN NINETY THREE HE HAS SHARED WITH US MOMENTS 
OF BRILLIANCE AS HE HAS CAPTURED 
TWO WORLD TITLES AND TWO OF THE 
FASTEST MAXIMUM BREAKS ON RECORD 
BUT WE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED SOME 
BIZARRE MOMENTS FROM RONNIE AS HE 
SEEMS TO HAVE EXPLODED FROM THE 
PRESSURE BUT THAT IS THE 
FASCINATING THING FROM THE ROCKET 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING 
TO GET 
TWICE THE WINNER HERE IN SHEFFIELD 
SHE COMES THE ROCKET RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HERE COMES THE ROCKET 
HE IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS IF YOU 
BEAT O'SULLIVAN YOU GOT EVERY 
CHANCE OF WINNING THE TOURNAMENT 
THE GAME NEEDS O'SULLIVAN BECAUSE 
HE IS THE MOST EXCITING AND MOST 
NATURALLY GIFTED PLAYER WE'VE EVER 
HAD 
THE QUESTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN HAD HOW MUCH OF IT HE CAN PRODUCE UNDER 
PRESSURE 
WHAT THEY BREAK WHAT A FANTASTIC 
MAXIMUM BREAK THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE 
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE OR SINCE 
FIVE MINUTES AND TWENTY SECONDS IT 
LOOKED AS THOUGH HE DIDN'T HAVE A 
CARE IN THE WORLD HE WAS IMMUNE TO 
PRESSURE ONE OF THE GREATEST 
BREAKS OF ALL TIME 
O'SULLIVAN HAD A PROBLEM IN 
DELIVERING ON HIS IMMENSE TALENT 
AND WHEN HE DIDN'T WIN AT HIS FIRST 
FEW ATTEMPTS IT BECAME A. HE HAS 
ADMITTED IN HIS BOOK IN TWO THOUSAND ONE HE 
ALMOST DIDN'T GET TO THE STARTING 
LINE AND WOULD NOT HAVE DONE HAD HE 
NOT BEEN PRESCRIBED PROZAC OVER OVER THE YEARS O'SULLIVAN AND HENDRY 
HAD HAVE HAVE HAD BITTER RIVALRY 
SOMETIMES IT WENT OVER THE TOP BUT 
DEEP DOWN AS ANY BOXER OR 
FOOTBALLER WOULD DEAL OUT BEFORE 
THEY WENT OUT TO BATTLE 
AND WHILE THAT MAY BE PAR FOR THE 
COURSE IN BOXING IT IS CERTAINLY 
NOT IN SNOOKER 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN IT IS LIKE THE ALEX HIGGINS 
ERA WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO 
A GREAT PLAYER BUT YOU DON'T 
KNOW IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A 
TANTRUM 
WHEN I HAVE SPOKEN TO TANTRUM BROLLY HE IS AN ABSOLUTE GENTLEMAN 
MOST OF THOSE ISSUES ARE WITH 
HIMSELF RELIEF RONNIE 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WAS ABSOLUTELY 
PULLING HAIR OUT OF HIS HEAD YOU 
COULD SEE THAT HE WAS STRUGGLING 
PETER WAS DOING HIS BEST TO PUT 
RONNIE OFF HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
WASTING HIS TIME BUT PETER WAS 
DOING WHAT PETER NEEDED TO DO TO 
BEAT HIM 
PETER EBDON WAS NOT 
CHEATING HE WAS PLAYING AT HIS OWN 
SPEED RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS HIS 
OWN DEMONS BUT WHEN HE GETS IT 
RIGHT HE IS THE GREATEST PLAYER TO 
WATCH 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAT YEAR 
RONNIE'S HEAD HAD GONE LITTLE BIT 
BECAUSE FOR SOMEONE TO CHANGE THE 
TIP THAT AMANDA TIMES THAT IS 
ANOTHER RECORD THAT HE WILL HOLD 
AND WILL NEVER BE BEATEN THAT 
MAN TO TIMES 
AFTER THE MATCH HE 
GAVE HIS CUE AWAY TO THE YOUNG LAD 
IN THE FRONT ROW YOU ARE TALKING 
ABOUT SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT DO 
THINGS THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE DO HE 
MAKES THE GAME VERY INTERESTING 
THE BOOKS SHOW THAT GRAEME DOTT 
BEAT HIM BUT IN EFFECT O'SULLIVAN 
BEAT HIMSELF 
THE CRUCIBLE DOES NOT SUIT THEM 
FOR ME OVER SEVENTEEN DAYS IF IT WAS 
OVER ONE WEEK HE WOULD WIN IT 
EVERY TIME 
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES 
BEING AWAY FROM HOME FOR THAT LONG 
TWO AND A HALF WEEKS HERE DEATH 
DEFINITELY TESTS HIM 
HE HAS WON 
TWO WORLD TITLES ALMOST TWENTY WORLD 
RANKING EVENTS A SHED LOAD OF 
MONEY AND YET HE IS AN UNDER 
ACHIEVER AND HE KNOWS THAT 
HE HAS WON TWO WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
YES BUT IF YOU ARE SAYING HE IS AN 
UNDER ACHIEVER AT THE CRUCIBLE YOU 
ARE NOT GIVING CREDIT TO THE OTHER 
PLAYERS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HE 
TENDS TO VIEW HIS MENTAL WELL BEING 
AS IMPORTANT RATHER THAN TROPHIES 
ONE HE LOOKS BACK OVER HIS CAREER 
MAYBE HE WILL THINK THAT WAY HE HE COULD HAVE BEEN BEHIND IT ARE THERE 
HE DUG HIMSELF OUT OF TROUBLE WELL 
IN THE END ONE OF SUDDEN THE CHINESE 
PLAYER 
CAME BACK SUPERBLY 
FOUR TO THREE IN FRONT ALL OF A SUDDEN 
WHEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS TESTED AT 
THE CRUCIBLE HE BECOMES GREAT PLAYER 
THE ATMOSPHERE IF HE PLAYER CANNOT PLAY WELL IN HERE 
HE HAS 
PRODUCED EXCELLENT ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BREAKS HE 
IS A CLASS ANIMAL UNDER PRESSURE 
HIS TEMPERAMENT IS NEVER IN 
QUESTION 
ALL WILL BE REVEALED QUESTION HERE IS AWAY AT MANY FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON AFTERNOON THERE WAS LATE NIGHT DRAMA AT THE 
CRUCIBLE YESTERDAY WE WILL LOOK 
BACK AT EVENTS IN GRAEME KEN 
DOHERTY IS MATCH 
TODAY I WILL BE 
COMMENTATING ON RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
HIS GAME HE IS ONLY FIVE TO FOUR IN FRONT 
THIS YOUNG MAN HAD HIM ON THE ROPES 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN 
SECOND ROUND 
MATCHES GET UNDER WAY TODAY AS WELL 
AND PETER EBDON LEADS THE WAY THE 
FORMER CHAMPION WILL BE MEETING THE 
KING WHO CONQUERED MARK SELBY IN 
THE OPENING MATCH MARK KING HE 
HAS BEEN WALKING TALL EVER SINCE 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN STRICTLY COME 
DANCING MEETS BIG BROTHER CLAUDIA 
AND DAVINA MCCALL CAUSED UPROAR 
THAT'S WHAT 
ALEX HIGGINS 
A MAN 
WITH GLASSES UPSIDE DOWN 
COME ON 
THE MAN WHO WILL OVERSEE THIS 
YEAR'S FINAL UNRAVELS MORE 
MYSTERIES FROM THE REFEREE'S RULE 
BOOK 
AND GET YOUR TICKETS THAT THE 
TRAINING STATION TO SEE JOHN 
INSPECT THE ACTIONS OF MORE 
UNSUSPECTING TRAVELLERS 
THIS THEATRE IS PRETTY COMPACT BUT 
IF YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE 
IT CAN GET A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING 
YESTERDAY FOR EXAMPLE LOOK SURE 
WHILE NO DOUBT IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS 
MATCH AGAINST BODY O'SULLIVAN FOR A 
BREAK AND PROCEEDED TO HOLD UP PLAY 
FOR SEVEN MINUTES WHEN HE GOT LOST 
ON THE WAY BACK FROM THE TOILET 
LAST NIGHT THINGS GOT RATHER 
LOST IN TRANSLATION AS WELL FOR HIS 
GREAT FRIEND AND COMPATRIOT 
THE N. C. WAS INTRODUCING THE REFEREES 
AND LIANG THOUGHT IT WAS HIS CUE TO 
COME DOWN THE STAIRS THE REFEREE 
EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD JUMPED THE 
GUN SURE ENOUGH HE DASHED BACK 
OUT AGAIN WRONG WAY HE GOT 
LITTLE BIT OF COACHING FROM THE 
TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR THE CAME BACK 
OUT AGAIN AND GOT THE BIGGEST CHEER 
OF THE NIGHT WHAT LOVELY MOMENT 
THIS WAS 
LIANG WENBO 
WELL DONE 
THAT MAN AND THEN THE SERIOUS STUFF RESUMED 
THEY SHARED THE FIRST COUPLE OF 
FRIENDS THIS IS FRAME TEN WITH THE 
IRISHMAN TEN POINTS BEHIND JOHN 
VIRGO AND DENNIS TAYLOR WERE 
FOLLOWING THE SUN FOLLOWING THIS 
ONE 
OH HE HAS MISSED IT AND IS IT A 
FREE BALL IT IS NOT A FREE BALL 
BUT THE GREEN IS ON 
NO FREE BALL 
BUT A CHANCE NOW HE GOT A FOURTEEN POINT 
LEAD IN HIS GREEN AND BROWN AND HE 
WILL GO ONE FRAME AWAY FROM VICTORY 
HE HAS GOT TO WORK THAT CUE BALL TO 
GET ON TO THE BROWN OFF THE GREEN THAT IS ONE WAY HE COULD STUN ROUND 
HE HAS GONE RIGHT THE WAY AROUND 
BUT IT IS TOO HARD I THINK UNLESS 
HE KISSES THE BRAND KNOW THE 
BRIANNAH KNOW THE BROWN 
THAT IS A BIT OF A GUIDE ISN'T IT 
THE BROWN WILL GO CLOSE TO THE 
CORNER POCKET LOOKING AT THAT 
PICTURE WELL 
AND IT IS A FREE BALL HE HAS HIT 
THE BLUE THERE WAS PLENTY OF THE 
BROWN STICKING OUT THAT MUST BE 
PURE TENSION JOHN 
HE HAS GOT TO 
MAKE KEN PLAY AGAIN FROM WHERE THE 
BALLS HAVE LANDED BUT AT THE SCORE 
BECAUSE KEN HAS TAKEN A FREE BALL 
IF HE PUTS KEN IN AGAIN KEN HAS 
GOT TO HIT THE BROWN OTHERWISE ALL 
IT IS ALL OVER THE FRAME 
THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT SHOT KEN 
DOHERTY HAS HAD A LIFELINE HERE HE 
CAN NOW TIED 
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT 
CHOICE I HONESTLY CAN'T BELIEVE 
THAT WHY TAKE THE BLUE ONE KEN 
WAS BANG IN TROUBLE IF HE POTS 
THIS NOW HE CAN TIE L. CANNOT 
BELIEVE THAT LAST SHOT 
THAT HIS 
YOUTH THE INEXPERIENCE OF YOUTH 
YOU SAW IT THERE IN A NUTSHELL IF 
KEN CAN PLAY UP NOW FORCE A BE 
SPOTTED BLACK THIS COULD BE A 
BIG TURNING POINT IN THE MATCH HE 
FELT KEN NEEDED A BIT OF 
INSPIRATION FROM SOMEWHERE MAYBE 
LIANG WENBO HAS JUST GIVEN HIM THAT 
SO A VERY UNEXPECTED REECE POT 
BLACK L. HONESTLY CANNOT 
BELIEVE HE TOOK THE SUN HE WAS TWENTY TWO 
IN FRONT HE COULD HAVE PUT KEN 
BACK IN HE DECIDED TO TAKE THE 
BLUE ON BUT THAT IS ALL HISTORY AND 
HE HAS LOST THE TOSS SO HE HAS GOT 
TO BREAK OFF 
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT I THINK HE HAS 
GOT TO PLAY THIS BLACK TO WHAT THE 
TOP CUSHION TOWARDS THE TOP 
CUSHION ADVANTAGE KEN DOHERTY 
BUT THERE IS A CHANCE HE COULD GET 
IN BEHIND THIS BLACK CUSHION FIRST 
WHERE DOES THE BLACK GO IT IS 
PRETTY GOOD IF THE WHITE WAS AWAY 
FROM THE CUSHION KEN WOULD TAKE IT 
THAT IS AN EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT 
THAT IS BETTER ONE THAN THE LAST 
ONE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY STUPID 
CANNOT GET IN BEHIND THE BLACK THIS 
TIME THAT IS ABSOLUTELY SUPERB 
THERE YOU SEE IT JUST OVER THIRTY SIX 
MINUTES FOR THIS TENSE TWELFTH FRAME A LOT 
IN THIS SITUATION 
IF THEY DON'T FANCY THE SAFETY 
BAKE HAVE A GO AT DOUBLING THE 
BLACK BELIEVE IT OR NOT KIRK 
STEVENS WAS A GREAT ONE FOR HAVING 
A GO AT THIS 
IS HE TAKING THE DOUBLE ONE HE IS 
AND IT IS CLOSE BUT NOT CLOSE 
ENOUGH BUT HE HAS GOT IT SAFE 
THAT IS THE OTHER WAY WITH THAT 
SHOT IF YOU PLAY IT HARD ENOUGH AS 
IT DOES NOT GO IN THE POCKET IT 
RUNS UP THE SIDE CUSHION THAT IS A 
GOOD SHOT WELL PLAYED 
WHERE IS THE CUE BALL GOING IS IT 
GOING IN OH MY WORD AND KEN 
DOHERTY HAS LOST THE FRAME LIANG 
WENBO IS NOW ONE FRAME AWAY FROM 
VICTORY HE LEADS NINE TO THREE 
THAT IS SO UNLIKE THE TACTICAL 
PROWESS THAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM KEN 
DOHERTY HE IS READY SCRAPPING FOR 
HIS TOP SIXTEEN FUTURE BUT AFTER WINNING 
THE NEXT TWO FRAMES IN A ROW THE 
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN CHAMPION IS RIGHT UP AGAINST 
IT HE IS AT THE TABLE IN THAME FIFTEEN 
AND IT LOOKS BLEAK HE IS FORTY SIX POINTS 
BEHIND HE IS AT THE TABLE AND IT 
LOOKS BLEAK 
HE IS USUALLY SO GOOD THAT THE 
SAFETY PLAY BUT THAT WAS A POOR ONE 
HE THINKS HE CAN GET ON THE BLACK 
I THINK HE IS O. K. IF YOU HIT THE 
BLACK AND THE RED AT THE SAME TOWN 
IT IS FOUL BUT HE WILL JUST CATCH 
THE BLACK FIRST WELL 
RIGHT IMPORTANT NOW POT THIS RED 
PLAY FOR THE PINK AND THE LEFT 
MIDDLE AND LEAVE YOURSELF A NICE 
ANGLE TO CANNON THOSE TWO REDS AND 
THE BLACK AND THAT LOOKS 
ABSOLUTELY INCH PERFECT TO ME HE 
CAN BRING THE TWO REDS INTO PLAY 
AND THE BLACK 
THAT IS A BIT UNLUCKY HE HAS TIED 
THE BLACK ON HE HAS POT ON THE RED TO GET ONTO THE PINK 
FORTY POINTS THE DIFFERENCE HE COULD 
BE TEMPTED BY THIS RED INTO THE FAR 
RIGHT CORNER 
WELL WHY DID HE PLAY IT SO HARD 
HE TRIED TO GET ON THE BLACK YOU 
KNOW DENNIS 
IT IS THE SHORT IT 
IS THE SORT OF SHOT IT IS O. K. TO 
PLAY IF YOU ARE LEADING 
IT WAS VERY AMBITIOUS TO TRY TO GET 
ON THE BLACK AFTER THAT DIFFICULT 
RED IT HAS TO BE SAID HE WANTED 
TO FINISH ON THE BLACK BUT UNDER 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE THE WRONG 
CHOICE 
HE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL HE DOES 
NOT SLIP PAST THIS RED ON TWO 
CUSHIONS AND LEAVE IT ON IT LOOKS 
A PRETTY GOOD EFFORT 
FALLA AND 
AMIS FOUL AND A 
WELL DONE YOU CAN SO EASILY GIVE 
SO MANY POINTS AWAY WITH MISSES AND 
HE CANNOT AFFORD TO 
WELL MUCH TOO THIN AND VERY 
FORTUNATE NOT TO LEAVE THIS RED A 
VERY FORTUNATE VERY FORTUNATE 
NEITHER PLAYER HAS PLAYED THAT WELL 
THIS EVENING IT IS ONLY BEEN 
EXCITING BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN THE 
QUESTION WILL KEN DOHERTY MAKE A 
COMEBACK 
IF YOU ARE MARKING THE COMEBACK PERFORMANCES OUT OF TEN THEY WOULD 
NOT BE THAT GOOD 
KEN JUST HAS NOT GOT GOING IN THIS 
MATCH 
IF THIS GOES IN ALL WELL AND GOOD 
BUT IF IT WOBBLES IT COULD THE 
GREAT POT TERRIFIC POT BECAUSE HE 
WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE ON THE BLACK 
AND BEING A LEFT HANDER AND YET 
AGAIN WE HAVE ANOTHER LEFT HANDER 
WHO IS A TERRIFIC POTTER 
THE LIST GOES ON OF LEFT HANDED 
POTTER'S 
BUT HE IS FIFTY TWO IN FRANCE POTTER'S NOW DENNIS AND THERE ARE ONLY FIFTY ONE 
REMAINING SO TEN KEN DOHERTY 
NEEDS A SNOOKER IF HE IS TO STAY 
ALIVE IN THIS MATCH 
AND KEN DID NOT GET IT SO IT IS THE 
WORLD NO SIXTY SIX MOVING UP THE 
RANKINGS ALL THE TIME THIS 
YOUNGSTER FROM CHINA BASED HERE IN 
THE SHEFFIELD AT IN THE ACADEMY 
AT SHEFFIELD HE HAS KNOCKED OUT 
KEN DOHERTY AFTER SIXTEEN SEASONS AT 
THE CRUCIBLE KENNA WAVES FAREWELL 
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO 
PLAYING AND PLAYING WELL HERE L. 
HAVE WORKED PRETTY HARD ALL SEASON 
REALLY BUT I HAVE NOT REALLY GOT 
THE RESULTS AND SEEN AT THE FRUITS 
OF MY LABOUR L. REALLY DON'T KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED OR WHERE IT HAS ALL 
GONE WRONG TO BE HONEST A COUPLE 
OF YEARS AGO I WAS AT THE TOP OF 
THE RANKINGS AND IS NOW I AM OUT OF 
THE SIXTEEN L. DON'T KNOW I AM A BIT 
SORT OF DUMBSTRUCK TO BE HONEST 
IT IS DISAPPOINTING TO NOT ONLY GO 
OUT OF THE SIXTEEN BUT TO WORK TO LOSE 
IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP WHEN YOU 
ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT IS SO 
MUCH AND GEARING UP FOR IT IT 
WILL BE HARD TO WATCH I MUST SAY 
KEN IS OBVIOUSLY DOWN ABOUT IT CAN 
YOU SUM UP THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT 
UPSET 
AS BIGGER DISAPPOINTMENT AS UPSET MARK SELBY SUFFERED IT IS AGAINST 
A NEW AND UP AND COMING PLAYER NOT 
KNOWING THE QUALITY OF THE PLAYER 
HE WAS UP AGAINST HE WOULD EXPECT 
KEN TO HAVE WON THROUGH THAT MATCH 
YOU WOULD HE SEEMED TO BE IN 
GOOD SPIRITS BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT 
BUT SOMETIMES HE HAS STRUGGLED 
AGAINST PLAYERS HE WAS SUPPOSED TO 
BID 
I HAVE PLAYED IN THE BID QUALIFIERS AT PRESTATYN AND I 
THOUGHT THIS BOY CHANGED HIS NAME 
BECAUSE ALL I KEPT HEARING FROM 
LEAR FROM THE NEXT CUBICLE WAS 
LIANG WENBO ONE HUNDRED HE HAS HAD A LOT 
MORE MATCHES AS WELL HE IS PLAYING 
IN THE ACADEMY AGAINST VERY HIGH 
QUALITY OPPONENTS HE IS TUNED UP 
KEN HAS BEEN PAYING HIS DUES SO 
SPEAK SO YOU CAN SEE THE 
EXASPERATION IT IS TOUGH AT THE 
TOP AS WELL AS THE BOTTOM YOU 
EXPECT IF YOU HAVE PAID YOUR DUES 
TO GET THE REWARD AND AS KEN QUITE 
RIGHTLY SAID HE IS NOT SURE WHERE 
TO GO NEXT 
THE IRONY IS WHO 
REACHED THE SEMI FINALS OF THE 
MASTERS AND THE FINAL OF THE MALTA 
CUP BOTH OF WHICH ARE NONE RANKING 
EVENTS AND THAT HAS PUT IN IN BIG 
TROUBLE AND SO IT IS GOING TO BE 
VERY CROWDED IN THE QUALIFIERS NEXT 
YEAR BECAUSE LOOK AT THE TO ING AND 
FRO ING AS IT STANDS IN THE TOP SIXTEEN IN WILL COME UP MARCO FU AND JOE 
PERRY FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IS A 
RECORD IN ITSELF PERHAPS IN WILL 
BE MARK KING AND MARK ALAN IT 
DEPENDS ON HOW MARK WILLIAMS AND 
OTHER PLAYERS AFFAIR HERE IN THE 
REMAINDER OF THIS CHAMPIONSHIP BUT 
LOOK AT THE PLAY HAS NO ONE GOING 
OUT KEN DOHERTY STEPHEN LEE 
STEVE DAVIS AND MATTHEW STEVENS 
AND MAYBE AT AS WELL IS MARK 
WILLIAMS IT WILL BE PRETTY 
COMPETITIVE DOWN THEIR 
THERE WAS MYSELF JIMMY WHITE OR 
JAMES WATTANA AND ALAN MCMANUS WHO 
CAME IN AND THEY SAID IT IS THE 
SEMI FINALS ON SIXTEEN YEARS AGO WE 
LEFT OUR HEADS OFF 
A SIGN OF THE 
TIMES 
IT IS AN EVEN GOT TO PLAY TIMES DECENT STUFF THERE IS NO INSURANCE 
POLICY REVIEW JAMES WATTANA TONY 
DRAGO EVEN THE PLAYERS DOWN THE 
BOTTOM OF THE LADDER ARE DECENT 
PLAYERS NEAR CHANG WHO PLAYED 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS NOT GUARANTEED 
ON THE MAIN TOUR OTHERWISE HE WILL 
NEED A WILD CARD 
IT IS FASCINATING 
STUFF IT IS CHANGING OF THE GUARD 
EXCITING AND DISAPPOINTING ALL AT 
THE SAME TIME GONE GENTLEMAN I I WILL STILL BE THERE 
HE WILL BE 
GRAFTING AWAY 
O. K. THEY'RE ONLY TWO FIRST ROUND 
MATCHES TO COMPLETE A THE CRUCIBLE 
E.'S B. REMIND YOU OF HOW THE DRAW 
STANDS AT PRESENT 
THE IRANIAN CHAMPION NOW FACES 
WRITE HIM DAY REIGNING CHAMPION 
THE BIGGEST UPSET OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THE DEPARTURE OF MARK 
SELBY ARGUABLY 
NEIL ROBERTSON IS BACK ON SATURDAY 
IN ROUND TWO HE IS LIKELY TO FACE 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
JOE PERRY WAS IN VERY GOOD FORM TO 
KNOCK OUT THE SECOND SEED GRAEME 
DOTT DOTT YESTERDAY WE WERE ENJOYING THE 
OPENING SESSION OF RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN'S MATCH AGAINST A 
YOUNGSTER THAT IDOLISED HIM FROM 
EIGHT THOUSAND MILES AWAY YOU DRANK DID NOT 
SEEM TO BE OVERRULED BY THE 
EXPERIENCE OF PLAYING HIS HERO 
LIU CHUANG 
THIS COULD HAD BEEN A BAPTISM OF 
FIRE FOR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CRUCIBLE 
DEBUTANT LIU CHUANG 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT FOREIGN 
OPENING FOR AN OPENING NOT 
ENOUGH TO KEEP RONNIE FROM BREAKING 
THE OPENING FRAME WITH A BREAK OF 
SEVENTY SIX 
THE ROCKET FOLLOWED THAT UP WITH A 
NONCHALANT EIGHTY SEVEN IN THE NEXT 
THINGS WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK BLEAK 
FOR LIU CHUANG ARE AS RONNIE GOT A 
SCRAPPY THIRD BUT IN FRAME FOUR 
THE YOUNG MAN DID HIS CONFIDENCE 
THE WORLD OF GOOD WITH A BREAK OF 
NINETY TWO 
THE KEY SHOT IN FRAME FIVE WAS WHEN 
RONNIE MISSED THAT BALL 
O'SULLIVAN WAS HANDING OUT GIFTS IN 
THE NEXT TWO UNBELIEVABLY THEY 
WERE TIRED AT THREE TO THREE THEY WERE TIED 
BOTH MEN HAD AN SPURNED CHANCES IN 
FRAME SEVEN UNTIL RONNIE DISHED UP 
WITH A BREAK OF FIFTY SEVEN 
NOT TO BE OUT DONE HE REPLIED WITH 
A FIFTY OF HIS OWN 
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IT IS WHICH 
RONNIE WILL COME OUT TO PLAY 
WE ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT PETER 
EBDON AND MARK KING ARE ALSO 
WAITING FOR THEIR BEST OF TWENTY FIVE IN 
THE SECOND ROUND WHICH STARTS 
TODAY TODAY GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN IT IS DAYS SIX OF SEVENTEEN AT

CHAMPION TWICE A WINNER AT THE 
CRUCIBLE DON'T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF 
HIM FOR A SECOND BECAUSE HE COMES 
THE ROCKET RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
IT IS ONLY AROUND ONE UP WHAT IS 
IT GOING TO BE LIKE IN THE FINAL 
FANTASTIC STUFF FROM A ROBERT HALL 
CAR CHOICE OF VIEWING IS ON THE 
INTERACTIVE BUT FOR NOW WE WILL 
STAY WITH JOHN VIRGO AND DENNIS 
TABOR DENNIS TAYLOR WHAT DO YOU 
MAKE OF THE MERINGUE LIU CHUANG'S 
PLAYING SO FAR 
I THOUGHT HE WAS TO 
RECEDE YESTERDAY HE HAD RONNIE 
GOING A LITTLE BIT AT ONE STAGE IN 
THE MATCH I THOUGHT HE WAS 
TERRIFIC YESTERDAY 
I WAS COMMENTATING ON THIS MATCH 
YESTERDAY JOHN AND THE YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER COULD QUITE EASILY 
HAVE WON ANOTHER COUPLE OF FRAMES 
HE COULD HAVE BEEN SIX TO THREE IN FRONT 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
YES CAN HE KEEP 
IT GOING IN THE SECOND SESSION HE 
LOST THE FIRST THREE IT'S VERY NO 
TORY HIS PERFORMANCE THAT A 
VERY NOTORIOUS PERFORMANCE LOSING 
THREE TO ZERO TOOK HIS IDOL IN THE GAME 
THAT WAS NOT THE BEST OPENING FROM 
RONNIE A LONG WAY FROM HIS 
INTENDED POT 
ALWAYS NICE TO GET IN EARLY IN THE 
OPENING FRAME OF THE SESSION 
THE ONE THING I DO NOTICE ABOUT ALL 
THESE CHINESE YOUNGSTERS HOW STILL 
THEY KEEP THEIR HEAD THEIR BASE 
THEMSELVES AT THE ACADEMY IN 
SHEFFIELD THEY BASE 
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS TO 
DO MY GAME IS TO KEEP YOUR HEAD 
STILL WHILE YOU DELIVER THE CUE 
TO DO IN THE GAME 
THERE MAY BE ONE OF THE BACK OF THE 
BUNCH BUT IS ALSO AVAILABLE 
THAT WAS A NERVOUS ONE HE NEVER 
GOT NEAR THE POCKET IT WAS A 
STRAIGHTFORWARD POT 
THAT WAS A SURPRISE THAT WILL BE A 
LITTLE BIT OF A SHOCK TO HIS SYSTEM 
MISSING A STRAIGHTFORWARD RED LIKE 
THAT NO EXCUSE AND NO REASON FOR 
IT 
NICE POT FROM RONNIE HE NEEDS TO 
EXERT HIS AUTHORITY I BELIEVE IN 
THIS MATCH 
HE GAVE FAR TOO MANY CHANCES FOR 
ME TO LIU CHUANG 
WHAT DID HE DO 
THERE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE WAS TRYING 
TO FLICK IT AWAY 
WAS HE TRYING TO CANNON IT IT 
DIDN'T LOOK AS IF HE WAS 
THERE WAS 
NO OTHER REDS AVAILABLE SO YOU HAVE 
TO ASSUME HE MISJUDGED IT 
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING 
STATISTICS THE SAFETY SUCCESS 
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WITH 
RONNIE'S EXPERIENCE HE WOULD HAVE 
OUT DONE HIM MAYBE THAT IS WHY THE 
MATCH IS SO CLOSE 
HE JUST SEEMED TO LOSE HIS TOUCH IN 
THE LATTER STAGES OF THE FIRST 
SESSION RONNIE 
HE GOT THE CANNON BUT A LITTLE 
THINNER THAN HE WANTED 
I DON'T KNOW IF THE TWO RED'S MAYBE 
A POSSIBLE PLANT HE HAS EVER DONE IT OVER DONE IT 
AS YOU SAY HE WAS DESPERATE TO 
AVOID THE RED ON THE OTHER RIGHT 
HAND CUSHION HAS WALKER I EVER MISSED A SHOT THAT WAS AN ATTACKING SAFETY SHOT 
HE'S MISSED IT BUT RONNIE CAN'T 
KEEP LEAVING HIM CHANCES LIKE THAT 
HE ISN'T GOING TO KEEP MISSING 
RONNIE AT THE MOMENT JUST SEEMS TO 
BE SCORING OFF OF HIS OPPONENT'S 
MISTAKES RATHER THAN PLAYING GOOD 
SAFETY 
IT WASN'T QUITE AS EASY AS IT 
LOOKED HE COULD HAVE BROUGHT A 
TEAM WILL ROLL IN 
ANOTHER ONE THAT WASN'T EASY IT 
WAS THE ONLY RED HE COULD PLAY THAT 
WOULD GET HIM GOOD POSITION 
IT IS A BIG DAY FOR THIS YOUNG 
MAN L. EXPECT HIM TO MAKE A FEW 
MISTAKES IT IS UP TO RONNIE TO 
PUNISH THEM 
I THINK YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE 
HEAD JOHN IT IS A BIG DAY FOR LIU 
CHUANG WHEN YOU THINK OF HOW MANY 
PEOPLE WILL BE WATCHING IN CHINA 
AUDIENCES OF UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION A 
LOT OF PRESSURE ON SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
AND HE SAW ONE OF HIS FELLOW 
COUNTRYMEN DEFEAT KEN DOHERTY 
LIANG WENBO WONDER HOW HE SLEPT 
LAST NIGHT PLAYING HIS IDOL 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AND JUST ONE 
FRAME BEHIND 
I AM SURE HE WAS PLEASED WITH THE 
SESSION HE DIDN'T LET ANYBODY DOWN 
HIMSELF OR HIS SUPPORTERS 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS IDOLISED BY 
THE PEOPLE IN CHINA HE SIGNED A 
LUCRATIVE CONTRACT LAST YEAR 
IT IS REPUTED TO BE AROUND HALF A 
MILLION POUNDS TO DO SOME 
COMMERCIALS IN CHINA RONNIE 
RONNIE IS DOING AN AWFUL LOT OF 
RUNNING AND REALLY IS IN TIP TOP 
SHAPE 
THAT WAS A VERY CLEVER SHOT TO 
DEVELOP THE OTHER RED SOMETIMES 
WHEN THE BALLS ARE AWKWARD HE 
LIKES THE CHALLENGE 
TO SEE IF HE CAN CLEAR UP YES YES THAT WAS A CLEVER SHOT WHEN HE 
POTTED THE RED BEFORE THAT ONE 
WHEN HE MOVED IT INTO PLACE 
HE HAS GOT SUCH A QUICK SNOOKER 
BRAIN BUT THIS IS THE TRICKY ONE 
FOR ME AND THEY HAVE BEEN ALL WEEK 
THAT WAS A CLEVER SHOT THERE 
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY ACCURATE AND 
HE WAS GOOD SHOT HE MISSED A FEW 
OF THOSE IN THE FIRST SESSION 
FOSTER I WAS THINKING THE SAME 
THING JOHN 
THIS IS A TOUGH SHOT INTO THIS 
RIGHT CORNER 
LIU CHUANG HAS HAD CHANCES IN EVERY 
FRAME EARLY ON 
RONNIE SHOULD BE TWO CLEAR NOW 
THAT WAS A GOOD BREAK BUT HE 
EFFECTIVELY RELIED ON TWO MISTAKES 
FROM HIS OPPONENT THAT IS A FOUL 
YOU TRY KNOWS THE ETIQUETTE YOU 
DON'T CONCEDE WHEN YOUR OPPONENT IS 
COMING TO THE TABLE THAT IS NICE 
TO SEE 
THAT WHITE DRIFTED A LITTLE BIT AT 
THE END 
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT CONCEDE I 
SUPPOSE IT IS BECAUSE IT IS THE 
FIRST FRAME OF THE SESSION THE YOUR 
RONNIE JUST HAVING A COUPLE OF 
PRACTICE SHOTS WITH HIS LEFT HAND 
I THINK THAT ATTEMPTED POT AND THE 
OTHER ONE HE HAS NOT ANY HOPE OF 
WINNING THIS FRAME HE JUST WANTS A 
BIT OF POTTING PRACTICE BUT YOU 
WON'T GET IT NOW HE LOOKED AT 
RONNIE AND SAID I'VE HAD ENOUGH 
SO RONNIE DOES TAKE THE FIRST FRAME 
RELYING ON A COUPLE OF MISTAKES 
FROM HIS OPPONENT BUT HE NOW LEADS 
IMPRESSIONS OF THE OPENING FRAME 
IF HE WANTS TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS 
MATCH HE HAS TO PLAY A LOT BETTER 
BECAUSE ONE THING YOU HAVE TO DO 
AGAINST RONNIE IS KEEP THE PRESSURE 
ON AND IF YOU DON'T TAKE YOUR 
CHANCES HE HAD THREE VERY GOOD 
CHANCES AND HE HAS FORGONE ALL OF 
THEM AND IF HE WANTS TO MAINTAIN 
PROGRESS HE HAS TO BE BETTER HE 
WAS PRETTY POOR 
FROM WHAT RESULT 
OF RONNIE YESTERDAY HOW FAR OFF 
HIS TOP GEAR DO YOU THINK WE ARE I I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK IT IS THAT 
TYPE OF MATCH TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE 
YOU WHILE IT IS A CASE OF GETTING 
ON HE WILL HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED 
TO HAVE THROWN AWAY AN EARLY START 
BUT HE RECOVERED WELL HE HAS THE 
EXPERIENCE THAT LIU CHUANG DOESN'T 
OF DEALING WITH MALTESE SESSION 
FRAMES FOR LIU CHUANG IT MIGHT BE 
IT HAS DAWNED ON HIM THE MAGNITUDE 
OF POSSIBLY WINNING OVERNIGHT AND 
HE HAS COME THAT A BIT LIKE A 
FRIGHTENED RABBIT IN HEADLIGHTS 
THIS WAS THE SAME PATTERN AS 
YESTERDAY'S OPENING THREE FRAMES 
REMEMBER RONNIE WAS THREE TO ZERO UP SO 
EARLY DAYS YET 
YES I AGREE WITH STEVE IT IS ALL 
ABOUT GETTING THROUGH THESE OPENING 
ROUNDS 
ALWAYS SEEM STRANGE BECAUSE WE 
START OFF WITH THE BEST OF NINETEEN 
WHEREAS MOST OF THE OTHER 
TOURNAMENTS APART FROM THE U. K. ARE 
BEST OF NINES JUST SOMETHING ABOUT 
THE CRUCIBLE 
IT SEEMS ONCE YOU HAVE GOT THROUGH 
THE FIRST ROUND OF 
THE THREE 
SESSION MATCHES YOU CAN SETTLE IN 
AND THAT IS WHAT RONNIE WILL BE 
LOOKING FOR AND THAT IS MORE LIKE 
THE SAFETY PLAY BUT WE EXPECT FROM 
RONNIE THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT 
THAT WE EXPECT 
STILL GOING FOR THE LONG ONES BUT 
CONTRARY AFFORD TO DO THAT 
THAT IS THE TYPE OF SHOT HE 
NORMALLY WOULD TAKE ON 
NORMALLY VERY GOOD AT THAT TYPE OF 
SHOT BUT IN THE CRUCIBLE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE WHEN THE PRESSURE 
IS ON AND YOU'RE PLAYING A GENIUS 
IT IS TOUGH 
RONNIE NOW PLAYING A FEW SHOTS LEFT 
HANDED IF HE COMES THROUGH THIS 
MATCH 
MARK WILLIAMS IS WAITING IN THE 
SECOND ROUND AND HE IS STARTING TO 
COME BACK TO FORM WHAT MATCH THAT COULD BE OVER THREE SESSIONS 
THAT IS WHEN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS RESTART THAT IS WHAT 
THE PLAYERS FEEL BUT A LONG WAY TO 
GO HERE 
HE PLAYED ONE OF THESE YESTERDAY 
AND PLANTED A RED INTO THE CORNER 
POCKET 
HE WAS BIT UNLUCKY THAT'S O. K. HE DIDN'T CATCH THE PINK QUITE SO 
ENOUGH BUT HE HELD THE CUE BALL IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE THAT IS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ARE 
QUITE FOR ENOUGH 
WHY DIDN'T HE PLAYED THE SHOT LEFT 
HANDED HE'S SO GOOD WITH THE LEFT 
HAND HE IS PUTTING THE EXTENSION 
ON TO STRETCH ALWAYS AMAZES ME 
THAT 
THIS IS A DELICATE LITTLE THAT SHOT THIS YOU HAVE TO DROP IN AND 
PLAY FOR THE BLACK 
MAYBE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TOUCH 
THAT HE DOES WHEN HE IS RIGHT 
HANDED 
HE EXPLAINED THAT WHEN HE WAS 
BREAKING OF HE PREFERS IT LEFT 
HANDED BECAUSE HE FEEL HE GETS THE 
CUE THROUGH BLATTER THREE BETTER 
HE WOULD RATHER NOT PLAY THE RED 
OVER THE POCKET 
IT IS LOOKING OMINOUS NOW FOR THE 
YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER BECAUSE 
RONNIE LOOKS TO BE IN FINE FORM 
IF RONNIE OPENS UP A THREE FRAME 
ADVANTAGE THIS YOUNG MAN WOULD 
HAVE AN AWFUL LOT ON HIS PLATE 
YOU MENTIONED AT NOT HAVING TO 
TOUCH WITH THE LEFT HAND HE PLAYED 
THAT LEFT HANDED AND CAUGHT THE 
RED ON THE WAY BACK 
HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL HE DOES NOT 
FOUL 
JAN VERHAAS IS LOOKING ON TO MAKE 
SURE HE DOES NOT TOUCH ONE OF THE 
REDS WITH HIS SLEEVE OR HAND 
IT WASN'T WORTH THE RISK WITH A 
GOOD POSITION HE WAS IN 
IT WAS 
AWKWARD BRIDGING THE YELLOW WAS 
NOT EASY YOU HAVE GOT TO TREAT 
THIS YOUNG MAN WITH RESPECT 
IF YOU LEAVE SOMEONE A POT ON 
DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE YOU 
COULD BE IN TROUBLE 
HE HAS LOST 
HIS TOUCH A LITTLE BIT NOW NEW 
CHANNEL LIU CHUANG 
OF COURSE THESE QUICK TABLES CAN 
DO THAT WHEN YOU DO LOSE YOUR 
TOUCH IT IS SO EASY TO OVER RUN IT 
BY QUITE A MARGIN 
THEY ARE GREAT WIN YOUR CUEING WELL 
VERY FAST CLOTH BUT IF YOU ARE 
SLIGHTLY OFF IT IS TOUGH 
I WAS JUST THINKING WHEN IT REALLY 
WAS CONTEMPLATING PLAYING THE 
YELLOW WHEN HE WAS REACHING OVER 
THE BALLS AS YOU GET SO NEAR THE 
WINNING LINE IN THIS FRAME SAM 
TORRANCE WHEN MARK ALLEN FOULED 
THE RED WITH HIS SLEEVE WHY DO 
SNOOKER PLAYERS NOT PLAY SHORT 
SLEEVES L. INQUIRED TODAY AND 
ACQUITTED THE SYSTEM TOURNAMENT 
DIRECTOR YOU CANNOT WEAR SHORT 
SLEEVES YOU HAVE GOT TO WEAR LONG 
SLEEVED SHIRTS 
I THINK SHORT SLEEVED WOULD BE O. K. 
IF YOU DIDN'T WEAR A WASTE CARD 
BEDFORD LOOK A BIT STRANGE 
OTHERWISE WHERE A WASTE CODE 
LIU CHUANG IS GOING OUT FOR A CALL 
DOWN RONNIE WILL BE THE HAPPIER OF 
THE TWO 
LOOKING VERY GOOD FOR RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN NICE TO SEE THAT HE IS 
RELAXED ENOUGH TO HAVE A JOKE AT 
THE END 
I THINK HE WAS PRETTY 
RELAXED AT THE START UNTIL IT GOT 
TIGHTER I SHOULD KNOW BETTER BUT 
THIS MATCH IS OVER FOR ME NOW HE 
HAS BROKEN THE BACK OF HIM L. KNOW 
I'M GOING TO REGRET IT 
MAKE A NOTE 
OF THAT EVERYBODY 
I AGREE WITH 
HIM I THINK HE HAS MISSED THE BOAT 
I THINK HE HAD A GOOD CHANCE 
YESTERDAY I THINK AT THE MOMENT 
HE HAS AND LOST HIS GAME A LITTLE 
BIT YOU HAVE GOT TO KEEP THE 
PRESSURE ON RONNIE ALL THE TIME 
THE FIRST FRAME TODAY WAS VERY 
IMPORTANT AND HE HAS THROWN AWAY A 
FEW GOOD CHANCES HE'S PUT HIMSELF 
RIGHT UNDER RED NOW 
YOU TALKED 
EARLIER ON ABOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE 
TO SLEEP ON THE FIRST SESSION'S 
PROGRESS THAT HE MADE AND THE IDEA 
THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BORDERED HIM 
THAT HE IS IN A MATCH AGAINST HIS 
IDOL 
THAT IS SOMETHING YOU CANNOT IDOL PREPARE FOR A MATCH THAT LAST TWO 
DAYS EVEN IN THE QUALIFYING 
SECTIONS YOU PLAY OVER ONE DAY 
THIS HAVING TO SLEEP ON A LEAD 
ORATE DEFICIT IS A NEW EXPERIENCE 
SOME PLAYERS DEAL WITH THE BETTER 
THAN OTHERS GENERALLY EVEN IF 
YOU'RE A LONG WAY IN FRONT YOU 
HAVE A TOUGH NIGHT SLEEP 
DID YOU 
FIND WHEN YOU FIRST CAME TO THE 
CRUCIBLE BUT THE DIFFICULTY IN NOT 
HAVING JUST ONE SESSION HAVING TO 
SPACE OUT 
IT IS SOMETHING YOU 
HAVE TO GET USED TO IF YOU PLAY IN 
THE AFTERNOON AND THEN THE 
AFTERNOON DID YOU PLAY IN THE 
MORNING AND THE EVENT IT IS LIKE 
AN ORDINARY QUALIFY HE IS ONLY SEVENTEEN 
AND HE IS PLAYING AGAINST ARGUABLY 
THE BEST PLAYER EVER IT IS AT HIS 
FIRST TIME AT THE CRUCIBLE IT IS A 
BIG EXPERIENCE FOR HIM IT'LL BE 
SOMETHING HE WILL LEARN FROM HE 
HAS GOT A BIG FUTURE IN THE GAME 
HOW EXCITING TO THINK IT WAS FOR 
THE CHINESE MEDIA YESTERDAY THERE 
IS A GOOD TWELVE OR FIFTEEN OF THEM HERE SO 
FAR IT HAS BEEN A PRETTY 
SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN 
WE HAVE SEEN 
IN THE PRESS ROOM OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF YEARS THE CHINESE 
CONTINGENT GROWING AND GROWING IT 
MUST BE GREAT FUN FOR THEM THEY 
HAVE SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT A 
COUPLE OF NEW NAMES ON THE BLOCK 
PASS MARCO FU FROM HONG KONG AS 
WELL TO HAVE FOUR PLAYERS AT THE 
CRUCIBLE FANTASTIC NOT GUARANTEED 
NEXT YEAR 
WE WILL HAVE TO BUY HIM 
A TOM TOM HERE HE IS HE IS O. K. 
HERE WE GO IT IS THE NEXT FRAME 
GOOD BREAK OFF FROM THE ALL PLAYER 
THE ALL PLAYER OF THE YOUNGER 
PLAYER 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD BREAK OFF SHOT 
WHEN YOU BREAK OF COMEDY WERE 
LOOKING TO GET THE WHITE AS TIGHT 
TO THE CUSHION BEHIND THE GREEN 
THAT IS WHAT REALLY IS FACED WITH 
A VERY DIFFICULT POT 
THAT WAS JUST MAGNIFICENT THAT IS 
HOW THINK HE PLAYED IT AS YOU CAN 
SEE THE CUE BALL DIDN'T RUN IN AND 
OUT OF BAULK THAT WAS A GREAT SHOT 
THERE IS MORE TO THIS GAME THEN 
POTTING BALLS VAN POTTING BALLS 
EVEN WITH THE BIG GLASS AS I USED 
TO WEAR QUITE NEVER WOULD HAVE GOT 
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT 
HE DIDN'T GET CLOSE REALLY BUT HE 
HAS LEFT A CHANCE NOW FOR LIU 
CHUANG LET'S SEE IF THE BOYS IN 
THE STUDIO ARE RIGHT 
CAN HE START STRINGING A FEW POTS 
TOGETHER 
LET'S SEE IF THIS YOUR PLAYER CAN 
STRING DOUBLE A. FEW POTS TOGETHER AND 
GET HIMSELF BACK IN THIS MATCH HE 
DID IT YESTERDAY IT IS TALL ORDER TO REPEAT THAT PERFORMANCE 
WE MAY SEE HIM PLAY THE CANNON INTO 
THE CLUSTER HERE HE'S A BIT 
STRAIGHT ON THE BLUE 
THERE MUST BE A RED ON THE SIDE 
THAT GOES L. CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT 
HE HAS PLAYED FOR THERE IS THERE 
SOMETHING I CANNOT SEE 
LOOK WHERE 
HE PUT THE WHITE HE CAN STILL TAKE 
THAT ONE ON 
HE SHOULD HAVE GONE IN 
THE CLUSTER IF THAT IS THE ONLY 
RED HE CAN PLAY FOR HE WAS PERFECT 
ON THE BLUE 
HE SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO OPEN THINGS 
UP THAT WAS A CHANCE A PERFECT 
CHANCE TO OPEN THE CLUSTER THERE 
IS ONLY ONE A LOOSE RED ONE NEAR 
THE TOP CUSHION HAS HE DECIDED NOT 
TO TAKE ANY CHANCES IS HE CHANGING 
HIS GAME PLAN L. WOULD BE SURPRISED 
IF HE DOES 
I THINK HE WILL GO INTO 
THAN THIS TIME OFF THE GREEN 
HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL 
YES HE DID 
FAIR PLAY TO HIM WHY HE DIDN'T 
PLAY IT OFF THE BLUE I DO NOT KNOW 
BUT IT HAS WORKED OUT WELL 
HE MADE HIS HIGHEST BREAK OF THIS 
MATCH IN FRAME FOUR YESTERDAY THE 
FRAME BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL HE MADE AND NINETY TWO BREAK 
UNLESS HE'S STRAIGHTEN THIS RED HE 
MAY HAVE TO GO UP FOR THE BLUE L. 
DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN JUST RUN 
THROUGH FOR THE BLACK THE OPPOSITE 
CORNER 
A BIT STRAIGHT BUT THERE IS A 
LOOSE RED ON THE LEFT OF THE 
CLUSTER THAT WILL GO INTO THE LEFT 
CORNER 
LET'S SEE IF HE CAN GET THE CORRECT 
OUT OF THE BLUE THIS TIME 
AT THE CORRECT SIDE OF THE BLUE 
HE MAY BE ABLE TO DROP THE BLACK IN 
AND LEAVE THE RED NEXT TO IT 
THIS IS DEVELOPING INTO A VERY GOOD 
CHANCE FOR LIU CHUANG 
HE GOT THE 
SAFETY SHOT THAT OR HE COULD NOT 
GET SAFE OR WAS FORCED INTO 
PLAYING THE POT RONNIE COULD NOT 
GET SAFE 
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AGAINST THE 
BEST PLAYERS YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE 
THE MOST OF YOU CHARGES THIS IS 
WHAT HE'S DOING HERE 
I DON'T THINK HE HAS GOT THE ANGLE 
IF HE HAD BEEN FURTHER UP THE TABLE 
HE WOULD HAVE LEFT THE WHITE 
HE MAY HAVE TO GO INTO THEM HERE 
HOW IS YOUR LUCK COULD HAVE BEEN 
BETTER DON'T THINK THERE IS 
ANYTHING AVAILABLE INTO THE LEFT 
CORNER IT IS A TRICKY ONE INTO THE 
RIGHT 
IT WAS JUST THE POSITIONAL SHOT ON 
THE BLACK HE JUST WENT SLIGHTLY 
WELL A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHTER HE 
WOULD HAVE HAD NO PROBLEM 
THAT COULD HAVE CARRIED HIM WANT TO 
WINNING THE FRAME BUT HE IS NOT 
FINISHED WITH YET THIS YOUNG MAN THAT IS A TERRIFIC POT 
IN FACT ONE OF THE BIG FRAME SEEN 
YESTERDAY'S SESSION WAS FRAME 
SEVEN LIU CHUANG MADE FIFTY NINE BREAK 
AND LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GOING TO GO 
FOUR TO THREE AHEAD BUT RONNIE PRODUCED A 
MAGNIFICENT FIFTY SEVEN TO PINCH THE FRAME 
CAN HE DO IT AGAIN HERE 
THE YELLOW HAS GONE ON THE BLUE 
SPOT BUT THERE IS A FEW PROBLEMS 
THE RED AGAINST THE SIDE CUSHION 
AND THERE IS THE BLUE 
SO IT IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE AS A 
STRAIGHT FORWARD RUN TO THE LINE 
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN HE IS 
CUEING WELL WHEN HE GETS THE CUE 
BALL MADE IT WITHOUT ANY EFFORT 
THE CUE BALL MOVING HIS TIMING IS 
CLEARLY SPOT ON 
WHAT SORT OF ANGLE 
HAS HE FINISHED ON A LITTLE BIT 
FURTHER UP THE TABLE HE COULD HAVE 
POTTED THE RED 
IT IS STILL THERE THE ANGLE AND 
HE HAS TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
BRING IT INTO PLAY 
THAT HASN'T SUPPORTED THE 
UNINTENTIONAL CANNON ONTO THE PINK 
THE BLUE COULD PLAY A BIG PART IN 
THIS 
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE KEY BALL 
THE BLUE 
IT IS FASCINATING TO SEE RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN HE IS LOOKING AT THE 
SCOREBOARD HE WILL BE THINKING 
ABOUT THE BLUE AND HOW HE'S GOING 
TO DEVELOP IT 
JUST A SLIGHT PROBLEM HE HAD WAS 
KNOCKING THE PINK AGAINST THE 
CUSHION HE IS GOING TO NEED THE 
PINK IF HE POTS A RED BLACK HE 
IS SEVEN BEHIND HE WILL STILL NEED THE 
PINK 
BAULK COLOUR IT WILL BE 
IT MIGHT 
BE BROWN THEN POT THE YELLOW THEN 
FLICK THE BLUE OUT BECAUSE IF HE 
DOES FLICK THE BLUE OUT YOU WOULD 
THINK THE WHITE WOULD IT AWAY FROM 
THE CUSHION 
HE'S GOING TO DO IT FROM THE BROWN 
THAT IS IF HE GETS A GOOD ANGLE 
THIS BROWN WILL PUT TO ONE POINT 
BEHIND BUT HE IS NOT PERFECT ON 
THE BROWN BY ANY MEANS 
HE IS BACK IN THE FRAME HE HAS NOT 
PLAYED THE BEST OF SHOT THERE HE 
SHOULD HAVE MADE CERTAIN OF THIS 
BROWN AND PLAYED A GOOD SAFETY ON 
THE BLUE LIU CHUANG FIVE POINTS 
IN FRONT HE NEEDS THE BROWN AND 
THE BLUE THE BROWN IS THERE WILL 
HE PLAY A DOUBLE ON THE BLUE 
RONNIE HAS GIVEN HIM A CHANCE 
SHOULD NOT HAVE WAY IT'S SO EASY 
FOR THE MAN MADE IT SO EASY I I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HE TAKES 
THE BROWN L. DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE 
DOUBLE ON THE BLUE SEEMS A BIT 
CLOSE TO THE POCKET 
THAT IS A VERY CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET FOR THAT BACK DOUBLE TO BE 
ON SO A GOOD SAFETY JUST PLAYED THE SAFETY SHOT THERE 
THE OLD DREADED DOUBLE KISS ONE OF 
THE PET HATES OF A SNOOKER PLAYER 
HE CAN PUT EVERYTHING INTO THE POT WELL PLAYED 
THE BOYS IN THE STUDIO THOUGHT THIS 
MATCH WAS OVER 
IT IS NOT YET IT WAS A GOOD ATTEMPT AT THE 
SNOOKER BUT THE MIDDLE POCKET BUT 
IN THE WAY 
HE HAS PULLED ONE BACK TO THIRTY 
SEVEN O'CLOCK P. M. IT WAS ALL OVER 
HE HAS 
COMPLETELY GONE LIU CHUANG HE HAS 
CRACKED I DON'T THINK HE WILL POT 
ANOTHER BALL 
IT IS WONDERFUL HOW 
QUICKLY IT CAN CHANGE YEP WHY YEP WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASSESS THE SKILLS ON 
SHOW FROM LIU CHUANG 
IN FAIRNESS 
VERY GOOD CHARACTER THERE BECAUSE 
HE WAS STRUGGLING NO DOUBT ABOUT 
IT HE COMPOSED HIMSELF MADE A 
VERY GOOD AT FIFTY BREAK WELL DONE 
HE IS IN THEIR COMPETING 
HE DID 
THIS YESTERDAY IN FAIRNESS HAVING 
BEEN THREE TO ZERO DOWN HE SHOWED A LOT OF 
CHARACTER TO COME BACK 
THE ONLY 
WAY YOU COULD ARGUE YOURSELF OUT OF 
THIS WHOLE WOULD BE TO SAY THAT HE 
LOOKS LIKE HE IS DOWN HE HAS 
RELAXED IT IS ONLY WHEN THE SCORES 
GET CLOSER THAT THE NERVES START 
GENTLY IT IS STILL MY OPINION THAT 
HE HAS GONE 
I DON'T THINK RONNIE 
IS BITING HIS NAILS JUST YET BUT 
WHO KNOWS 
THE REASON HE DID THAT SLIGHTLY 
MORE DIFFICULT POT WAS IF HE HAD 
TAKEN THE OTHER ONE HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN BEHIND THE BLACK UP 
IN A COUPLE OF SHOTS TIME HE WILL 
LEAVE HIMSELF ON THE RED BEHIND THE 
BLACK AND CLEAR UP THE BLACK SPOT 
THAT IS WHY HE IS A TERRIFIC TO 
WATCH I THINK HE WILL PLAY 
RED 
HE'S DEBATING WHETHER TO GO INTO 
THE PINK OR NOT OPEN THE MARK 
OPEN THEM UP 
HE WAS JUST STRAIGHT ENOUGH TO GO 
FOR THE BLACK BUT HE WOULD HAVE 
LIKED TO HAVE BEEN ON THE BLACK IN 
A WAY THAT HE CAN MOVE THE RED THAT 
IS NEXT TO THE BLACK BUT I DON'T 
THINK HE CAN 
THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM IT JUST 
WENT BUT THE WRONG FOR RONNIE 
SLIGHTLY WRONG 
SURPRISING HE PLAYED FOR THE PINK 
THERE BUT HE OR BEAST HE DID 
TRYING TO DRILL THROUGH AND IT IS 
ALWAYS DIFFICULT IS HE ON 
ANYTHING HE'S HAVING A CLOSE LOOK 
AT SOMETHING IT IS IS IT 
SOMETHING TO THE RIGHT CORNER TERRIFIC SHOT 
DOESN'T THAT LAST FRAME JUST SOME 
OF SNOOKER LIU CHUANG PLAYED A 
GOOD SAFETY SHOT FORCED RONNIE 
INTO AN ERROR HE GOT INTO THE 
BALLS THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY 
DID WHICH WAS ADVENTUROUS OF THE 
BROWN HE DID NOTHING WRONG 
DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE IF 
YOU LEAVE YOUR OPPONENT THE CHANCE 
YOU CANNOT LOSE THE FRAME YOU 
CAN LOSE THE FRAME BUT RONNIE IS 
TAKING THESE REALLY WELL NOW 
HE IS VERY GOOD AT THIS TYPE OF 
SHOT A LITTLE BIT OF LEFT HAND 
SIDE OFF THE SIDE OF THE CUSHION HIT THEM PERFECT 
I THINK THIS MATCH IS OVER NOW 
THIS IS RONNIE AT HIS FLUENT BEST 
HERE 
IT IS THE NATURE OF SNOOKER THEY 
CAN ONLY BE ONE MAN AT THE TABLE 
WOULDN'T EXPECT HIM NOT TO CLINCH 
THE FRAME AT THIS VISIT NOW 
HIS HIGHEST BREAK HAS BEEN A BREAK 
OF EIGHTY SEVEN THAT WAS IN THE SECOND FRAME 
WELL WHAT A MISS SIXTY FIVE IN FRONT WITH 
A POSSIBLE SIXTY SEVEN STILL REMAINING A 
LAPSE IN CONCENTRATION THERE ALL 
HE HAD TO DO WAS POT THAT RED AND 
THE FRAME WAS HIM SURELY WE CANNOT 
HAVE ANOTHER TURN HERE 
WELL THERE 
IS ENOUGH ON SIXTY SEVEN MAXIMUM 
BUT THAT WAS CARELESS FROM RONNIE 
YOU WOULD NEVER EXPECT HIM TO MISS 
A RED LIKE THAT YOU TAKE IT FOR 
GRANTED 
HAS HE GOT THE POSITION RIGHT 
BECAUSE IF HE HAS HE COULD GET A 
CANNON ON TO THE ONE NEXT TO THE 
BLACK BUT I DON'T THINK HE 
PLAYED IT TO LEAVE AN ANGLE TO BE 
ABLE TO ROLL THE RED IN AND CAN 
THEN THE RED NEXT TO THE BLACKOUT 
HE CANNOT DO THAT NOW IF HE TAKES 
ONE MORE PINK THEN HE WOULD STILL 
NEED BLACKS BUT HE WOULD ONLY BE 
ABLE TO TIE 
SO HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET A 
GOOD ANGLE THIS TIME ON THE RED HE PLAYED THAT WELL 
GOOD SHOT I AM JUST WONDERING IF 
THIS RED GOES INTO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET IF HE IS STRAIGHT ON IT 
CAN HE DROP IN MAYBE NOT KNOW 
RONNIE DID HAVE A GLANCE AT IT IF 
THE WHITE WAS A FRACTION TO THE 
RIGHT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE IT 
ON 
RONNIE IS THE HOT FAVOURITE TO TAKE 
THIS FRAME NOW THE FRAME HAS TAKEN 
ON A NORMAL PATTERN NOW HE WILL 
HAVE TO PLAY A GOOD SAFETY TO FORCE 
A MISTAKE 
THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD SAFETY SHOT 
I CAN TELL YOU 
THAT IS EXCELLENT 
AND APPRECIATED BY RONNIE TAPPING 
THE TABLE HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL 
HERE GOOD SHOT IF HE MISSES THE 
BROWN IT IS AN EVEN BETTER ONE 
YEAR WHEN YOU SAY GOOD SHOT 
BECAUSE THE FACT HE KNOCKED THE 
PINK SAFE AS WELL YES 
THAT IS A 
BONUS ISN'T IT 
TERRIFIC POT HE NEEDS TO BE ON THE 
BLACK BUSY ON THE BLACK L. DON'T 
THINK HE IS IS HE ON THE BLACK 
AND IF HE IS NOT HE WILL NEED AT 
LEAST ONE SNOOKER MAYBE TWO BUT 
WHAT AN EFFORT TO WHAT A FANTASTIC 
LONG POT ACE DOWN RUN IT THROUGH 
AND HE WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF INCHES 
TOO FAR A STATIN RUN 
TERRIFIC POT IF HE HAD NOT HAVE 
POTTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE NEEDED 
TWO SNOOKERS HE IS NOT OUT OF THIS 
FRAME JUST YET WELL PLAYED 
WHERE IS THE RED GOING OVER THE 
POCKET IN FACT HE JUST SAYS THAT 
IS ENOUGH FOR ME RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
IS LOOKING IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE HE 
EXTENDS HIS LEAD HE IS EIGHT TO FIVE IN 
FRONT AND NEEDS TO FOR A PLACE IN 
THE SECOND ROUND 
YOUR REPUTATION 
LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE INTACT 
THANKS VERY MUCH WHAT DO YOU THINK 
JOHN AND I ARE IN THE STUDIO FOR 
DON'T CARE HOW OLD THE PLAYER IS 
YOU CANNOT MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR HIM 
IF YOU PAY PEANUTS YOU GET MONKEYS 
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU ARE BACK TO 
YOUR EXPERT STATUS 
I DON'T KNOW 
BUT IT LOOKS AS IF HE GOT LUCKY 
STOP COVERING YOUR BACK 
IT HAS 
BEEN A GOOD GAME 
HE IS ONLY SEVENTEEN 
THIS FELLOW FROM CHINA BUT I THINK 
JOHN PARROTT HAS UNEARTHED THE NEXT 
TIGER WOODS OF SNOOKER WHO HAVE 
YOU FOUND 
THEY SAY YOU ARE NEVER 
TOO OLD TO COMPETE BUT WHAT ABOUT 
TWO YOUNG IF THEIR CAMERA PANS 
DOWN HERE YOU WILL SEE THIS YOUNG 
MAN HOW OLD ARE YOU FOUR 
WHO IS FOUR YOUR FAVOURITE PLAYER RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET 
HIM WE WILL SORT THAT OUT GO AND 
GET YOURSELF OVER THERE THIS IS 
HIS FATHER AS YOU CAN SEE DOWN 
HERE WE PUT HIM ON LITTLE STEP 
TO GETTING PLAYING HAS HE GOT 
LITTLE TABLE AT HOME 
YES EIGHTY SIX BY 
THREE TABLE AT HOME AND HE HAS BEEN 
PLAYING SINCE 
HE WAS EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND AND HE PLAYS ON AT EVERY DAY DOES HE 
EVERY DAY 
FANTASTIC HE IS NOT BAD ON TELLY 
IS HE DOES HE WANT TO BE OF 
PROFESSIONAL 
HE WANTS TO BE A PROFESSIONAL PROFESSIONAL SNOOKER PLAYER 
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT AND JUST 
WATCH THE WAY HE CHALKS HIS CUE BY 
THE WAY JUST CHALKHILL CUE PLEASE

LOOK AT THAT HOW MANY HOURS DAY 
ABOUT AN HOUR A DAY

UNLUCKY WELL DONE YOUNG MAN WHO 
IS GOING TO WIN DON'T CHAMPIONSHIP 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP RONNIE THERE RONNIE THERE IS A SURPRISE HAZEL THAT'S THAT'S FANTASTIC WE KNOW OF AN EAR CAN 
THIS ONE IS A KNOCKOUT ISN'T HE 
IT WON'T BE VERY LONG BEFORE HE 
LEARNS THE RULES THAT OF THE GAME 
IT IS GOOD TO SEE TALENT COMING 
THROUGH 
YES IT IS WHAT 
IS NICE THROUGH IS FROM THE PARENTS' POINT OF VIEW 
WATCHING THEIR CHILDREN COMING 
THROUGH AS LONG AS THEY DON'T PUSH 
THEIR CHILDREN TOO STRONGLY IF 
THEY SHOW SIGNS OF ENCOURAGEMENT 
IT IS MARVELLOUS GONE ARE THE DAYS 
OF IT BEING CONSIDERED A MISSPENT 
YOUTH 
IT DOES SEEM LIKE HE LOVES YOUTH THE GAME ALREADY 
HE CAN SEE THE 
WAY HE CHALKS HIS CUE IS FANTASTIC 
IF YOU CANNOT BE A TOP CLASS 
SNOOKER PLAYER HOW ABOUT A TOP 
CLASS SNOOKER REFEREE SHE WON A 
GUY WHO COPS LOT OF STICK IF YOU 
GET SOME DECISIONS WRONG OR INDEED 
A LADY YOU ARE GUIDE BUT ONE 
REFEREE CAN START UNRAVELLING MORE 
OF THE MYSTERIES FROM THE REFEREE'S 
POINT OF VIEW 
WE NOW KNOW THAT KNOWS MISSES ARE 
CALLED BY THE REFEREE BUT THERE ARE 
CERTAIN SITUATIONS THAT GUINNESS IS 
CALLED AUTOMATICALLY 
FOR INSTANCE THE SITUATION AFTER 
THE PLAYER HAS POTTED A RED AND IS 
NOW ON A COLOUR IF THERE IS A 
STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE CUE BALL TO 
ANY PART OF THE COLOUR THAT THEY 
PLAY A ELECT TO GO ON A COLOUR 
WHICH IS FULLY SNOOKERED IT DOES 
NOT MATTER HOW DIFFICULT THIS 
UPSHOT WAS DON'T FORGET THAT AFTER 
POTTING A RED ALL THE COLOURS 
BECOME THE BALL ON HERE ARE A FEW 
MORE AMIS IS ALWAYS CALLED IF THE 
CUE BALL FALLS SHORT OF THEIR BREAD 
ANOTHER AUTOMATIC AND THIS IS 
CALLED WHEN A PLAYER TRIES TO 
SWERVE AROUND A SNOOKERING BALL BUT 
IT'S THAT BALL ON ITS WAY PAST AND 
FINALLY IF A PLAYER MISCUES AMIS 
IS ALWAYS CALLED SHOULD HE MISS 
THE BALL ON LET ME REMIND YOU THAT 
IN ALL THESE SITUATIONS SNOOKERS 
ARE REQUIRED ACE AMIS CANNOT BE 
CALLED UNLESS THE REFEREE IS 
CONVINCED THAT THE SHOT WAS PLAYED 
WITHOUT ANY INTENT TO HIT THE BALL 
ON 
IS THERE EVER AN OCCASION WHEN ON YOU ARE HAVING TO SECOND GUESS THE 
REFEREE ABOUT HOW HE IS GOING TO 
CALL SOMETHING BEFORE YOU PLAY IT 
GENERALLY NEARLY EVERYTHING IS 
CALLED AMIS IT'S VERY TRUE READY 
HE AND WAS DEALING WITH THE MATCH 
YESTERDAY WHERE HE DIDN'T CALL ONE 
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS HARD TO 
GET OUT OF 
IT IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR 
THE REFEREES THEY TRIED TO USE 
THEIR DISCRETION IN CERTAIN 
INSTANCES BUT USUALLY THEY GOOD 
CRITICISED WHEN THEY DO THESE DAYS 
IT HAS BECOME THE UNWRITTEN RULE 
THAT EVERYTHING IS IN THIS THAT'S 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE RULE BOOK 
SAYS EVERYTHING IS AMIS 
BUT IT IS 
NICE TO SEE WHEN THEY TOOK SHOW 
SOME DISCRETION IN THIS CASE 
HAVING THE FACT YOU HAVE SOME 
COMMON SENSE AND DISCRETION IT 
MAKES THE ROLE BETTER 
BUT THE TASK 
WILL PART OF THE GAME IS VERY HARD 
TO READ EVERY SO DURATION IS 
DIFFICULT BUT THE TACTICAL PART 
OF THE GAME AT LEAST THE PLAYERS 
KNOW WHERE THEY STAND IF EVERYTHING 
IS AMISS 
BUY IN LARGE PLAYERS ARE 
SELF POLICING AREN'T THEY THEN THEN THIS ROLE IS A DIFFERENT SITUATION 
THE FACT THAT YOU GOT STOPPED FROM 
CHEATING NOW MEANS YOU ARE NOT 
TRYING TO CHEAT SO THERE FOR THE 
ROLE OF DEFEATS ITSELF IT IS A 
PROBLEM AGAIN HAS GONE PROBABLY 
THE GAME WAS INVENTED IN THE DAYS 
WHEN PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW HOW 
IMPORTANT EVERY DECISION WAS GOING 
TO BE MADE NOW THAT THE GAME IS 
VERY VERY SERIOUS THE ROLES HAVE 
TO BE TIGHTENED UP IN CERTAIN AREAS 
I AM SURE WE WILL TALK MORE ON THE 
SUBJECT AS THE DAY GO ON DAYS GO 
ON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
DIVIDING SCREEN TODAY WE HAVE BEEN 
SEEING PETER EBDON THE TWO THOUSAND TWO 
CHAMPION COMING FOR THE START OF 
HIS SECOND ROUND MATCH HE IS 
PLAYING MARC CAIN WHO HAS BEEN 
VERY CHIPPY CHIPPER SINCE PUTTING 
MARK SELBY AT THE TOURNAMENT IN SEVENTEEN 
YEARS OF TRYING MARK HAS NEVER 
BEEN INTO THE QUARTER FINALS SO 
LET'S HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT THE 
FIRST FRAME OF THIS PARTICULAR 
MATCH HE KNOWS IT IS GOING TO BE A 
VERY LONG HARD GRAFT IF HE IS TO 
GET THERE BECAUSE REMEMBER THESE 
SECOND ROUND MATCHES ARE BEST OF 
THREE SESSIONS AND IT IS A TWENTY FIVE FRAME 
MATCH 
HE HAS HEARD THAT VERY HARD HASN'T 
IT HASN'T HE HE SCENES BATTLE 
BAFFLED BY IT 
YES BOTH PLAYERS 
HAVE COME THROUGH REALLY HARD 
MATCHES IN THE PREVIOUS ROUNDS AND 
ARE BOTH GOING TO BE MATCHED SHARP 
AND I WOULD EXPECT THIS GAME TO BE 
RELATIVELY CLOSE 
MARK KING HAS REALLY TOUGHENED UP 
HIS GAME IN THE LAST SEASON OR TWO 
HE IS A VERY HARD MATCH PLAYER AND 
HAS COUNTRY GOT AN EXCELLENT CHANCE 
OF GETTING INTO THE TOP SIXTEEN 
PROVISIONALLY EIGHTEEN ONE OR TWO 
RESULTS HAVE COME FOR HIM SO FAR 
WITH TEN WITH KEN DOHERTY GOING 
OUT THAT HAS MOVED HIM UP A LITTLE 
BIT 
GOOD RECOVERY THAT DID NOT PLAYED 
ABOUT PARTICULARLY WELL THE TWO 
REDS EITHER SIDE OF THE BLACK COCK 
ON L. DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE ON OR BELOW THE PINK 
GREY SHOT THAT WAS EXCELLENT WELL 
PLAYED GREAT SHOT 
HE DID HAVE 
SOME GOOD FORTUNE AROUND THE BLACK 
HE COULD HAVE SHIFTED ALL SORTS OF 
REDS AROUND THE BLACK PIT IT WAS 
SO WELL PAID HE DESERVED IT 
PLAYED 
THE WAY HE PLAYED THAT HE PROBABLY 
TRIED TO PUSH THE READ OUT OF THE 
WAY TO GET THE BLACK OVER BOTH 
POCKETS HE JUST MISSED THE CASE 
CASE 
THE BLACK IS CLEARLY ON BUT THE 
ANGLE HE HAS ON THE RED MAKES IT 
MORE DIFFICULT 
MARK KING IS THE ONLY PLAYER WHO 
DOES NOT HAVE ANY LEGS TO IT AT ALL 
HE CROUCHES ON EVERY SHOT ALMOST 
AS IF HE IS 
A BAR STOOL 
IT IS A WEIRD ACTION BUT THE WAY HE 
HAS LEARNT HOW TO PLAY 
JUST SLIGHTLY AND A HIT THAT AND HE 
WILL BE DISAPPOINTED HE IS NOT 
TOPSIDE THE BLEE BECAUSE GETTING 
ONTO THE NEXT ONE WILL BE QUITE 
DIFFICULT 
A PROMISING START THE MATCH FOR 
MARK KING HE LOOKED VERY GOOD IN 
THE SECOND SESSION AGAINST MARK 
SELBY WHO WAS SECOND FAVOURITE FOR 
THE TITLE 
I KNOW HE HAS A GREAT RECORD 
AGAINST RONNIE O'SULLIVAN ALMOST A 
FIFTY PER CENT RECORD AGAINST HIM NOT TO 
PLAY NOT TOO MANY PLAYERS WHO CAN 
BOAST THAT 
JUST FLEW OFF THE CUSHION A LITTLE 
BIT BUT THE LAST RED IS STILL ON 
THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW BOUNCERS THE 
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THAT LOOKS TO 
BE PERFECT THERE ALL OF A SUDDEN 
IT SPRANG OF THE SECOND CUSHION IT 
IS STILL O. K. HE CAN STILL GET ON TO 
THE BLACK NICELY THIS IS THE KEY 
SHOT IF HE HAS GOT A NICE ANGLE ON 
THE BLACK THE KISS ON TO THE RED 
THAT IS USED IF HE KISSES THAT 
FOOTBALL 
FAULT BALL HE SHOULD WIN THE 
FRAME FROM NOW 
THERE YOU RARELY DO MATCHES START 
WITH CENTURY BUT THIS IS THE 
FIRST SESSION OF THREE IN THIS 
MATCH BEST OF TWENTY FIVE FRAMES PLAYED 
TODAY THIS IS VERY GOOD CHANCE FOR A CENTURY 
A POSSIBLE ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO AVAILABLE WITH 
BLACKS ONCE AGAIN PERFECTLY PLAYED 
THE FRAME IS NOW SAFE THERE IS THE 
EQUATION SEVENTY THREE AND COUNTING HE IS AS 
GOOD AS OVER THE LINE CAN HE MAKE 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE REDS AND FIVE BLACKS THE 
FRAME IS NOT REALLY HIS CONCERN 
IT IS ANOTHER GOOD SHOT ANOTHER 
GOOD CANNON HE DID NOT REALLY 
CATCH THE RED FULL ON BUT IT 
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HE HAS NOT 
DONE A LOT WRONG HERE 
A VERY ENCOURAGING START FOR MARK 
KING A BREAK OF EIGHTY ONE AND HE WINS THE 
FIRST FRAME OF THE MATCH 
WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED ON THIS 
FIRST SESSION OF THAT SECOND ROUND 
MATCH LATE ON THIS AFTERNOON BRACE 
YOURSELF WHAT DOES SNOOKER MEAN TO 
A STRICTLY COME DANCING HOST AND 
THE PRESENTER OF BIG BROTHER YOU 
ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT WITH CLAUDIA 
WERE COMMON AND DAVINA MCCALL 
WHEN I SAY THE WORDS SNOOKER THE 
WORD SNOOKER WHAT IMAGES COME TO 
MIND 
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WELL DO MIND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I 
WAS YOUNGER IT WAS AWFUL WAS AT 
A FRIEND OF MINE AND HER DAD HAD A 
SNOOKER TABLE WE WERE ON IT I WAS 
ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE AND THROUGH 
THEIR FOR IT 
THEY STICK THROUGH 
FELT THAT IS REALLY BAD EVER EVER SINCE THEN I'VE HAD A PHOBIA OF 
PLAY OF SNOOKER IN GENERAL 
I ONCE 
WENT OUT WITH A BOY HE WAS QUITE 
PLEASANT BUT HE LIKED SNOOKER A LOT 
WE WOULD SIT NEXT TO HIM AND IT WAS 
EARLY ON SO I PRETENDED TO LONE 
SNOOKER ANYWAY HE SAID A LOT 
SAFETY SAFETY L. DID NOT KNOW WHAT 
IT MEANT THAT I ENDED UP SAYING IT 
ALL THE TIME ITSELF L. THOUGHT IT MEANT I WAS CLEVER GO ON HOW EXCUSE ME

BEAUTIFULLY DONE 
CONSIDERING I

A MAN WITH GLASSES 
DENNIS TAYLOR 
COME ON 
FROM BEGINNING TO END KNOW NOT KNOW NOT YOUR THING DO THEY NOW BUT IF YOU 
DID WOULD THERE BE ONE GUY YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO WIN IT WHAT ABOUT 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
IS HE STILL 
PLAYING 
DO YOU FANCY HIM YOUR PLAYING YOUR HEAD WAS COCKED TO ONE SIDE ARE 
YOU INTO HIM BY YOU MARRIED TO 
HIM HE CUED HE IS REASONABLY HIM IS HE CUED HE IS REASONABLY CUED LET'S GO FOR RONNIE 
I DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT TO SAY 
AFTER THAT DON'T THINK THEY WERE 
WATCHING MUCH OF THE SNOOKER BUT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THEM FOR 
BRIGHTENING UP POWER AFTERNOON IS IS THERE ANY OTHER SPORT SHE WILL NOT 
LEAVE ALONE 
THAT IS VERY UNFAIR 
I'M SPOKEN FOR 
ONE THING THE 
FIRST OF ALL YOU ARE FLIRTING WITH 
PHIL MICKELSON AT THE MASTERS AND 
NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN 
I DENY IT BY DEREK YOU O'SULLIVAN TO MY EMPLOYERS IT IS BACK TO 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IT NOW IN THE HIS 
MATCH AGAINST LEE CHANG 
VERY GOOD BREAK OFF FROM LIU CHUANG 
HE REALLY NEEDS THIS FRAME 
THIS COULD KEEP HIM IN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT WAS INCH PERFECT ON THE BLACK 
HE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT ONE 
AGAIN THOUGH THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TREMENDOUS RECOVERY 
HE LOOKED A BIT STRAIGHT ON THIS 
BACK BLACK 
HE HAS JUST NOT GOT THE ANGLE ON 
THE BLACK TO BRING OTHER REDS INTO 
PLAY THIS IS A DELICATE LITTLE SHOT 
HE GOT THE DOUBLE BUT JUST LOST THE 
BALL SEVEN REDS SEVEN BLACKS HE TRIED TO 
I THINK THE LEAD EIGHT TO FIVE IN FRONT 
MADE HIM HAVE A GO AT THAT 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS ONLY LOOKING 
FOR ONE MORE CHANCE AND HE WOULD 
CLINCH THIS SO THAT WAS GOOD SHOT FROM LIU CHUANG 
RONNIE PUT HIS HAND UP AND 
APOLOGISED TO LIU CHUANG BECAUSE HE 
PLAYED IT CUE BALL TO THE BAULK 
CUSHION AND THE YELLOW HAS COME TO 
HIS RESCUE HE PLAYED THE CUE BALL 
JUST MENTIONING RONNIE PLAYING THAT 
VERY DIFFICULT RED TO TRY TO KEEP 
THE BREAK GOING CHANCE OF A 
MAXIMUM HE HAS MADE EIGHT MAXIMUM 
BREAK IN TOURNAMENT PLAY ANOTHER 
PLAYER HAS MADE EIGHT MAXIMUM 
BREAKS STEPHEN HENDRY HE WILL BE 
THE FIRST TO THE MAGICAL NINE 
WHO WILL BE 
THAT WAS TRICKY ALONG WAY AWAY 
FROM THE OBJECT BALL THE CUE BALL 
HE DID NOT PLAY WITH LOT OF PACE HE HAS GIVEN HIS OPPONENT A CHANCE NOW AND THIS IS A GOOD CHANCE 
A COUPLE OF THE REDS NEAR THE GROUP 
OF FOUR HE'S LOOKING TO SEE IF 
ONE OF THEM IS AVAILABLE IF IT IS 
HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO CANNON INTO 
THEM BECAUSE THEY WOULD CLEAR EACH 
OTHER HE LOOKS AT STRAIGHTEN THE 
BLACK HE LOOKS STRAIGHT ON THE BLACK 
RONNIE HAS TREATED THIS YOUNG MAN 
WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT BUT TAKING 
THAT DIFFICULT RED TO GO FOR THE 
MAXIMUM I AM WONDERING IF THAT 
COULD BE A TURNING POINT 
YES YOU 
CAN'T TAKE LIBERTIES WITH THE GAME 
OR YOUR OPPONENT 
THAT IS A BAD MISS 
WE CAN FORGET 
ABOUT THAT NOW BUT THAT WAS A GOOD 
CHANCE TO GET RIGHT BACK INTO IT 
NO REASON TO MISS A STRAIGHTFORWARD 
BLUE LIKE THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE 
POT AND CONCENTRATED ON THE 
POSITION 
RONNIE IS LOOKING AT THE RED THAT 
LIU CHUANG WAS LOOKING AT HE DID 
MANAGE AND HE WAS A LOT CLOSER 
HE DIDN'T MANAGE IT ONE MORE RED NEEDED 
HE HAS BEEN VERY CONSISTENT NO 
REALLY BIG BREAKS BUT A BREAK 
OF SIXTY ONE FORTY ONE AND FORTY EIGHT 
THE CHALK CAME OUT OF HIS POCKET 
LIU CHUANG HAS CONCEDED THE FRAME 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS ONE FRAME AWAY 
FROM A PLACE IN THE SECOND ROUND 
HE HAD CHANCE THERE THE OPENING POT WAS FANTASTIC 
CLOSE TO THE POCKET YOU HAVE TO 
HIT THESE PERFECTLY 
AND 
HE DID YES YES AND AS SOON AS THAT RED GOT IN AND HE WENT ON THE BLACK HE WAS 
THINKING MAXIMUM BREAK HIM IN 
AN ATTEMPT TO GET THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN YOU CAN 
PLAY THE WRONG SHOT OBVIOUSLY 
WHEN HE WAS EIGHT TO FIVE IN FRONT HE FELT 
THE MATCH WAS OVER AND THAT IS WHY 
HE PLAYED THE SHOT BUT YOU CAN'T 
TAKE LIBERTIES AND A HUGE ONE GOT A 
CHANCE AFTER THAT BUT HE MISSED A 
BLUE INTO THE MIDDLE MARK WILLIAMS AWAITS HE PLAYED IT WELL 
IF IT HAD FINISHED THEIR HE WOULD 
HAVE LEFT ONE TO THE RIGHT CORNER 
FINISHED THERE 
A BIT AMBITIOUS THAT ONE THAT 
TYPE OF SHOT ON THESE LIVE THE 
TABLES IF YOU WERE NOT CUEING SPOT 
ON IT IS SO EASY TO MISS THEM 
OR NOT 
HE DIDN'T REALLY GET INTO THE REDS 
BUT THERE AS LONG AS HE DIDN'T 
STICK ON THE MAIN BUNCH THAT WERE 
AVAILABLE 
HE JUST WANTED TO CATCH THAT RED 
MAY BE A LITTLE BIT FULLER 
THAT TIME HE DID STICK THAT LITTLE SMILE TELLS US HE IS 
NOT ON VERY MUCH THIS IS VERY 
TOUGH RED HE'S LOOKING AT INTO THE 
RIGHT MIDDLE POCKET 
HE WAS PUTTING 
AS HE WALKED AROUND 
REALLY THERE IS ONLY ONE RED THAT 
IS SAFE THE ONE NEAR THE RIGHT 
SIDE CUSHION BUT WE KNOW WHAT HE 
HAS GOT ON HIS MIND HE HAD IN HIS 
MIND IN THE PREVIOUS FRAME 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR A MAXIMUM BREAK TEN THOUSAND 
FOR THE HIGHEST BREAK ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN I 
SHOULD SAY 
THE MAXIMUM BREAK IT ALWAYS AMAZES 
ME WHEN HE MADE THAT MAXIMUM WHICH 
YOU AND I COMMENTATED ON FIVE 
MINUTES AND TWENTY SECONDS 
UNBELIEVABLE 
IT SEEMS TO STRAIGHTEN UP A LITTLE 
BIT THAT RED 
I THINK IT WAS A 
KICK JOHN FIVE REDS FIVE BLACK'S 
FIVE BLACKS 
CAN THIS YOUNG MAN KEEP HIMSELF IN 
THIS YEAR'S KIDS THE LIGHT OF OUR 
LIVES WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS A EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
WIN OR LOSE THIS EXPERIENCE WILL 
STAND HIM IN GOOD STEAD FOR THE 
REST OF HIS CAREER 
YOU HAVE TO 
ADMIRE THEM LEAVING HOME AND BASING 
THEMSELVES AND THIS COUNTRY IT IS 
A BIG ORDEAL FOR A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IT IS GREAT TO 
HAVE THEM IN THE GAME IT REALLY IS NOT HE PLAYED THAT BEAUTIFULLY 
THERE IN THE COMFORTABLE RED 
AVAILABLE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
BETTER IF HE WAS ABLE TO GET A BIT 
CLOSER THERE IS A COMFORTABLE 
RED 
HE'S GOT A PRETTY GOOD ANGLE 
PROBABLY TRY AND SCREW BACK PAST 
WHERE THE WHITE IS AT THE MOMENT 
IF HE CAN GET SOMEWHERE NEAR THAT 
CIRCLE HE FORGOT TO POT THE BLACK THOUGH 
IT WAS A TRICKY POSITIONAL SHOT 
BUT HE HAS GOT HIMSELF THREE POINTS 
IN FRONT OF THIS FRAME 
YES HE JUST TRIED TO PINCH A BIT 
THERE 
I'M NOT CERTAIN HE'S NICELY ON THE 
PINK HE WAS SLIGHTLY HAMPERED BY 
THE BLACK THAT WAS WELL PLAYED 
THE WORST POSSIBLE SCENARIO IS TO 
BE STRAIGHT ON THE PINK 
HE CAUGHT THE YELLOW AND IF HE 
MISSES THE BLUE IT HE MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN O. K. 
THAT WILL THE LITTLE BIT THICK 
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT THICK TOO THIN ON THE SAFETY 
HE HAS MADE IT PRETTY GOOD SAFETY HE COULDN'T AVOID PUSHING IT TO THE CORNER POCKET HE HAS HIT IT TOO THIN BUT HE GOT 
AWAY WITH IT HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE 
FLUKED A SNOOKER HE HOLDS HIS HAND 
UP AND APOLOGISES TO HIS IDOL 
THIS IS NOT A GOOD SHOT IT NEEDS 
TO RUN ON A LOT THAT WAS A BIG 
TARGET THE GREEN AND BLACK HE IS 
NOT OUT OF IT YET THIS YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER NOT AN EASY ONE TO HIT 
THAT IS AWKWARD CUEING THE ONLY 
OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS A COUPLE OF 
TIMES ACROSS THE TABLE THIS IS 
JUST AS DIFFICULT THERE IS LOT 
OF ROOM TO GO ROUND THE BACK OF THE 
RED IT'S A FREE BALL 
HE IS NOT GOOD ON GREEN OR BROWN SO 
HE MIGHT WANT THEM IT REPLACED L. 
KNOW WHAT I WOULD BE DOING WANT 
THEM REPLACED PUT THEM BACK PLEASE 
REFEREE 
HE WILL HAVE TO FIND THE POSITIONS 
OF WHERE THE BALLS WELL HE WILL 
HAVE KEPT A CLOSE EYE ON WHERE THEY 
WERE BEFOREHAND WE CAN SHOW YOU 
WHERE THEY WERE THAT IS WHERE THEY 
WERE BEFORE HE IS JUST ASKING ONE 
OF THE MARKERS TO BRING IT UP ON 
THE MONITOR IT IS NICE TO SEE THAT 
SOME OF THE REFEREES JUST LIKE TO 
TRY AND REPLACE THEM BUT IF YOU 
HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY USE IT IT IT TOOK THEM A WHILE TO BOW DOWN TO 
TECHNOLOGY 
OUR SEASONED VIEWERS WILL REMEMBER 
THE GOLDEN SHOT 
TERRIFIC HIT I DON'T KNOW WHERE 
THE RED WENT 
HE WANTED A THIN ONE BUT HE HIT IT 
A BIT TOO HARD IT IS TOUGH POT THOUGH 
BUT WHEN HE IS CUEING WELL THERE 
IS NOT MANY POTS THAT ARE TOUGH HE 
HAS A CHANCE HERE TO POT THE YELLOW 
IT WILL COME BACK ON ITS SPOT THIS 
COULD BE THE END IF YOU GET THIS 
ONE JUST RIGHT 
JUST A LITTLE BIT PASTY WILL HE 
PLAY IT LEFT HANDED 
HAS HE PLAYED 
HIS LAST SHOT IN THIS YEAR'S WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IT IS IT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN'S CANCER NOW HANN'S 
HE HAS PUT UP A GREAT PERFORMANCE 
HERE AGAINST HIS IDOL RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO 
SAY FOR A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD IT IS QUITE 
REMARKABLE REALLY 
I THINK POT BLACK WAS ONE OF THE 
MAIN PROGRAMMES THEY STARTED 
WATCHING IN CHINA LOTS OF TALENT 
I THINK HE KNOWS NOW HE WILL NOT 
BE BACK TO THE TABLE 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WAS A BIT 
DISAPPOINTING IN THE FIRST SESSION 
BUT HE TOOK A FEW LIBERTIES TO 
ENTERTAIN THE CROWD BUT HE HAS 
ACCUSED MAGNIFICENTLY WELL PLAYED 
NEW CHAIRMAN BUT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
IS LOOKING FORWARD TO ROUND TWO 
A VERY RESPECTABLE HANDSHAKE 
BETWEEN THE TWO MAN BETWEEN AMANDA 
AND A TEENAGER ACTUALLY FIRST 
WHAT YOU MAKE MAKE OF RONNIE'S 
PROGRESS 
HE HAS DONE THE FIRST PROGRESS OBJECTIVE GET TO THE SECOND ROUND 
PROBABLY WILL NOT BE TOO BOTHERED 
ABOUT HOW HE HAS PLAYED HE HAS 
PLENTY OF SNOOKER TO PLAY JUST 
PLEASED THE MAIN THING GET OVER 
THE FIRST ONE AND CONCENTRATE ON 
THE REST OF IT 
NEW CHANNEL HAS HAD 
TO PLAY FIVE MATCHES TO GET HERE 
LIU CHUANG 
HE IS A VERY GOOD 
PROSPECT WHAT HE HAS DONE OVER THE 
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS PLAYING 
O'SULLIVAN AT THE CRUCIBLE IT IS A 
FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE THAT YOU 
CANNOT BUY L. HAVE PLAYED DOES 
QUALIFIERS VERY TOUGH TO GET 
THROUGH HE HAS DONE REMARKABLY 
WELL FOR A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
WHAT IS THE 
MOST IMPORTANT LESSON HE WILL HAVE 
LEARNT 
PLAYING RONNIE YOU HAVE TO LEARNT KEEP THE PRESSURE ON AND TAKE YOUR 
CHANCES 
WILLIE IS WITH STEVE DAVIS CHANCES NOW RONNIE 
JOB DONE FIRST ROUND HEART OF THE 
WAY 
YES POLICE TO GET THE FIRST WAY ROUND OUT OF THE WAY PLEASED THREE TO ZERO THREE TO ZERO UP IT LOOKED LIKE A BREEZE IT 
LOOKED LIKE YOU TO GO FOR IT OFF 
THE GAS THEN YOU'RE FOUR TO THREE DOWN BUT 
A GREAT COUPLE OF FRAMES TO FINISH 
THE SESSION 
I CANNOT REMEMBER MUCH 
OF IT L. DRIFTED ABOUT HALFWAY 
THROUGH THE GAME OF NOT BECAUSE I 
WASN'T ENJOYING PLAYING BUT 
BECAUSE OF THE THINGS GOT ON MY 
MIND YOU LOSE YOUR WAY AND YOU 
CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT 
EIGHT TO 
FIVE UP AND ALL OF A SUDDEN 
PRESENTED WITH A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN OPPORTUNITY I I LIKE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVENS I'VE HAD A COUPLE THIS 
SEASON IS IT IS GOOD FOR THE 
CROWD IT IS ALWAYS AN EXTRA BUZZ 
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING TO TRY DID 
PAIN THE CROWD AND I WILL JOIN IT 
THAT THEY ENJOY IT I ENJOYED 
THAT THEY ENJOY IT 
A DILEMMA FOR 
THE PLAYERS BIG PRIZE FOR THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
AGAINST WINNING THE MATCH 
I LIVE 
FOR EXCITEMENT L. GET EXCITED BY 
CERTAIN THINGS LIKE BE CLEARANCES 
STUFF LIKE THAT OH ONE FOUR SEVEN IS LIKE THAT 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE EVERY BALL SAFETY 
IS NOT IN THE GAME PLAN THEN ARE 
JUST TRYING TO GET THE BALLS AND 
THE POSITION AS YOU NEED TO THAT 
IS PROBABLY WHAT MY GREATEST ASSET 
IS MAKING SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING 
A TOUGH NEXT ROUND MATCH MARK 
WILLIAMS YOU HAVE GOT A DAY OFF A 
BIT OF RUNNING BUT OF PRACTICE I I DON'T KNOW ABOUT PRACTICE ARE 
RUNNING MAYBE 
I THINK ENJOYMENT IS THE KEY WORD 
FOR RONNIE HE DOES LOOK AS THOUGH 
HE IS RELAXED INTERESTING ABOUT 
THE RUNNING I UNDERSTAND HE IS 
RUNNING UP TO FIFTY MILES WEEK AT 
THE MOMENT THAT SEEMS TO BE PAYING 
DIVIDENDS FOR HIM 
HE IS VERY GOOD 
AT IT L. HAVE GOT POLES TO SAY THAT 
HE IS NEVER OUT OF THE TOP TWENTY IN 
THE RACES HE HAS RUN IN HE LOOKS 
VERY FIT AT THE MOMENT 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF THE PROSPECT OF THE MATCH 
AGAINST MARK WILLIAMS 
IT SHOULD BE 
A CLASSIC L. THINK MARK IS OF FAR 
FROM GETTING BACK TO HIS BEST 
NOT FAR A MOUTH WATERING PROSPECT 
MOVING ON SHEFFIELD COMMUTERS WILL 
RUN A FAST TRACK TO SUCCESS JUST 
LAST WEEK WHEN THEY BUMPED INTO 
JOHN AND SHAUN MURPHY AT THE TRAIN 
STATION 
WARNING JOHN ARE YOU A REGULAR 
PLAYER 
I HAVE PLAYED A LITTLE BIT PLAYER WHAT SHOT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR 
YOU 
A I HAVE NEVER GOT THE STUN YOU RUN IT RIGHT L. NEVER GET IT AS I 
WANT IT 
IT IS QUITE A TRICKY SHOT 
POSSIBLY THE TRICKIEST 
THE STUN 
RUN THROUGH HIS HALF A STONE AND 
HALF A RUN THROUGH SO THE PLAYERS 
ON THE TELLY MAKE IT LOOK EASY YOU 
WERE GOOD AT PLAYING THAT GOOD STUN 
RUN THROUGH I'M GOING TO PLAY A 
STUN SHOT WITH EIGHT WHILE STUNT 
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD POSITION FOR 
THE BLACK 
NOW HE'S GO TO POT IT STUN IT BUT 
STAGGER THE CUE BALL THERE SO IT 
HAS ENOUGH LIFE TO END UP ON THE 
BLACK JUST ABOVE THE MIDDLE THIS TIME 
ONCE AGAIN IT IS ALL ABOUT WHERE 
YOU STRIKE THE CUE BALL BASICALLY 
THE SAME STRIKE THE SAME DELIVERY 
BUT JUST MOVING THE TIP SLIGHTLY 
HIGHER UP THE CUE BALL JUST ABOVE 
THE MIDDLE 
PERFECT STUN RUN THROUGH DON'T 
WORRY ABOUT MISSING THE POT THE 
EXECUTION OF THE SHOT WAS SPOT ON 
YOU WANT ANOTHER GO YES JOB WELL DONE THANK YOU 
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT JOHN PARROTT 
WOULD IMPART THE SECRETS OF THE 
STUN RUN THROUGH IT IN PUBLIC 
PLACE THIS IS A MYSTERIOUS ART HE 
HAS GONE ABOUT FOR YEARS 
THE ONE 
AND ONLY TIME 
TIME NOW FOR MORE 
FROM TABLE TO THIS AFTERNOON IT IS 
ONLY FIVE YEARS THAT MARK WAS 
LOSING HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE HE WAS 
THREATENING TO RETIRE HAPPILY HE 
HAS CHANGED HIS MIND 
I HAVE BEEN HERE A FEW TIMES BUT I 
HAVE NEVER REACHED THE QUARTER 
FINALS IT IS NICE TO GET THE FIRST 
ROUND OUT OF THE WAY I FEEL LIKE 
I'M INVOLVED IN THE TOURNAMENT NOW 
THE FIRST ROUND YOU COULD PLAY ON 
THE FIRST DAY OR THE LAST DAY OF 
THE FIRST ROUND YOU DON'T REALLY 
FEEL INVOLVED HOPEFULLY I'LL PLAY 
AS GOOD AS I DID IT ONLY REALLY 
STARTED BEFORE I MISSED THE RED 
BEFORE THAT I WAS FINE 
THEN I WENT BACK TO MY CHAIR AND I 
THOUGHT THAT I'D MISSED THE MONEY 
IT WAS PLEASING TO GET SO CLOSE 
BUT DISAPPOINTING NOT TO GET IT AS 
LONG AS IT WASN'T AN EASY SHOT 
SOMETHING THAT IT COULD KILL YOU 
FOR A FEW YEARS 
NIGHTCLUB PER CENT OF PLAYERS WANT 
TO SHOUT AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICE 
AND SWEAR NINETY NINE PER CENT SOMETIMES 
IT IS BEST FOR YOU L. HAD 
THE TABLE THE OTHER DAY AND I DID FEEL A BIT 
BETTER I HIT THE TABLE MY HAND 
WAS A BIT SORT BUT I FELT BETTER 
GETTING IT OUT AT THE TIME IS 
SOMETIMES BETTER THAN HOLDING IT IN 
I MUST ADMIT I HAVE TAKEN A MORE 
RELAXED ATTITUDE JUST GO OUT THERE 
PLAY YOUR GAME IF YOU WIN YOU WIN 
WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT PETER HE 
HAS WON THE U. K. THE WORLD HE IS A 
GREAT PLAYER L. DON'T THINK HE GETS 
THE RESPECT HE DESERVES THAT IS 
WHAT YOU GET WITH PETER I WANT TO 
GO OUT AND PLAY AS GOOD AS I DID 
AGAINST MARK 
HE HAS GIVEN AWAY SMALL CHANGE 
THERE BUT MARK WAS ON THE MONEY 
WHEN IT CAME TO THE PRIZE FOR 
MAXIMUM BECAUSE IT IS IN FACT 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND I KNOW RONNIE SAYS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND 
BUT WHAT IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND WITHIN FRIENDS 
ANYWAY LET'S GET BACK TO THIS 
MATCH MARK KING TOOK THE FIRST 
EBDON WON THE NEXT WE ARE INTO 
FRAME THREE EBDON LEADS FIFTIES 
SEVEN TO THIRTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN TO THIRTY TWO 
HE IS ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN 
THE GAME OF THAT KIND OF SHOT MARK 
KING FOUL AND A MISS 
I THINK IT WILL GO BACK SO HE IS 
QUITE CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE POCKET ON 
THIS IF HE'S GOING TO MAKE THE 
SHOT HAPPEN 
IT LOOKED LIKE HE CAME CLOSE TO THE 
FIRST CUSHION WHICH WE KNOCKED OFF 
MAYBE HE'S GOING TO PLAY A 
DIFFERENT SHOT NOW THIS IS QUITE 
PAR WHAT A SHOT THAT WAS A BIT SPECIAL 
AMAZING SHOT HE PROBABLY THOUGHT 
THE ANGLE WASN'T ON 
FABULOUS SHOT THOUGH FROM PETER 
EBDON 
MARK KING MUST HAVE BEEN THINKING 
HE WAS GOING TO GET A FEW SHOTS ON 
THE BOARD THERE THE FACT THAT HE 
NOW NEEDS YELLOW AND GREEN HAS NOT 
MADE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IT IS THE SAME SCENARIO AS BEFORE 
DIDN'T TRY MUCH THERE MAYBE GET IN 
BEHIND THE GREEN HE HAS DECIDED 
THE WAY TO GO IS WITH THE DOUBLE 
THAT IS THE ONLY CONCERN WITH THAT 
SHOT THOSE DOUBLES YOU THINK 
THERE ARE SHOTS WERE YOU CAN'T 
LEAVE ANYTHING ON BUT YOU CAN 
FLICK THE JAW AND THIS COULD BE A 
HALF CHANCE FOR THE FLYING A 
FRAME 
THAT WAS PLAYED VERY WELL IF HE IS 
STRAIGHT ON THE BROWN HE IS NOT 
TERRIBLE BECAUSE HE CAN PLAY A 
DIRECT SCREW SHOT IT IS ALL ABOUT 
THE ANGLE THAT HE HAS GOT HERE IT 
MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
HE IS ROUND THE HOUSES A BIT ON TO 
THE PINK HE WOULD LIKE TO BE RIGHT 
IN BEHIND THE BLACK 
I'M SURE HE PLAYED IT IT INTO THE 
CORNER 
HE MIGHT BE A BIT CLOSE TO THE 
BLACK 
I THINK IT IS WORTH A DOUBLE BLACK NOW HONESTLY I DON'T THINK HE CAN HOLD FOR THE 
BLACK UNLESS HE PLAYS THE CANNON 
INTO THE BLACK 
HE HAS PLAYED IT WITH A CHECK SIDE 
WOW WHAT A SHOT HE MADE THE CUE 
BALL SLOW DOWN HAVE SO MUCH THERE 
THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT CLEARANCE 
ABSOLUTELY PRESSURES MARK KING HAS 
STOLEN THIS FRAME WE ARE NOW LIVE IN THE FIFTH FRAME 
A NASTY KICK FROM MARK KING 
STARTED DISAPPOINTING START TO 
FRAME FIVE DIDN'T SOUND QUITE 
RIGHT SO HE BROKE DOWN 
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF A KICK THE 
KICK THAT BOUNCES LIKE AN 
EXPLOSION AND A PUSH TO THE JAW 
BOTH REDS POT IN THE RIGHT HAND 
CORNER THE YELLOW OFF THREE 
CUSHIONS IS THE GUARANTEED POSITION 
THE ONE IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO 
PLAY 
THAT ABSOLUTELY RATTLED IN THE JAWS 
ANY SLOWER IT WOULD HAVE GONE IN 
SO MARK KING'S BAD FORTUNE ON THE 
BLACK MAY HAVE GONE AGAINST HIM AT 
SOME POINT HE HAS TO GET INTO THE 
CLUSTER OF NINE REDS 
I DON'T THINK THE RED WILL PASS THE 
BLACK IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER 
MARK IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS THAT 
CUES UP AS IF HE'S GOING TO PLAY 
MIDDLE WHEN HE'S PLAYING A SCREW 
SHOT BUT THEN HE DID INTO IT 
YOU'RE NEVER QUITE SURE WHETHER THE 
TIPPERS COMPARISON TO WHAT SHOT 
HE'S PLAYING BUT HE PLAYED THAT 
BEAUTIFULLY 
THIS IS NOT QUITE HALF BALL I'M 
NOT SURE HE CAN GENERATE ENOUGH 
POWER TO GET INTO THEM FROM THAT 
ANGLE A LITTLE BIT CARELESS 
IT WAS A GOOD EFFORT THERE 
UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NOT SPREAD 
ENOUGH THAT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE 
NO HE HAS PLAYED IT BUT NOT ALL 
THAT WELL 
THE RED TWO UP FROM THE BLACK THIS 
CUT INTO THE CORNER 
THE PROBLEM IS THE RED ON THE LEFT 
HAND SIDE HE HAS TO GET ROUND THE 
BACK OF THAT BUT THE POT IS ON IF 
HE WANTS TO TAKE IT ON 
AN AGGRESSIVE SAFETY SHOT THAT 
AND PLAYED VERY WELL 
MARK JUST TAPS THE TABLE REALISES 
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT GET INVOLVED 
MARK ALMOST A BIT OF BANTER WITH 
THE PLAYERS WENT PIECES OF GOOD 
FORTUNE WENT AGAINST HIM HE IS A 
REAL CHARACTER EXCELLENT REPLY 
VERY TOUGH WE WERE TIGHT ON THE 
CUSHION WHEN YOU ARE TIGHT ON 
THE CUSHION 
THE ONLY TIME THAT SHOT IS ANY GOOD 
IS WHEN HE HITS IT PERFECT 
PETER HAS GOT A PROBLEM AND WE CAN 
SEE WHAT THAT IS HE CANNOT GET TO 
THE RED ON THE RIGHT TO PLAY THE 
SAFETY SHOT YOU CAN SEE A COUPLE 
ON THE LEFT OF THE TABLE JUST THE 
PATH BACK TO THE BAULK AREA THAT IS 
THE WORRY IF HE CAN SEE THE RED 
HE WOULD DOUBLE AND PLAYED ACROSS 
BUT THERE IS JUST NOT ENOUGH THERE 
IF HE MISSES THE BLUE IT IS A 
TERRIFIC SHOT HE MADE IT LOOK EASY 
BUT THAT WAS A TOUGH SAFETY SHOT 
THE SAFETY HAS BEEN BETTER IN THIS 
FRAME THE SAFETY STATS ARE NOT 
VERY GOOD TO BE HONEST YOU WOULD 
THINK ONE PLAYER WOULD HAVE THE 
ADVANTAGE IN THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT 
BUT THE BREAK BUILDING HAS BEEN 
QUITE GOOD WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN IN 
THE BALLS BUT THE LAST TWO OR 
THREE SAFETY SHOTS HAVE BEEN VERY 
GOOD INDEED 
WHAT ABOUT THE DEEP SCREW ON THE 
OTHER ONE PLAY THE POT YOU'RE 
ALMOST GUARANTEED TO GET THE JAWS 
AND TRY AND SCREW THE BALL BACK IT IT IS A LONG TIME AGO I WOULD HAVE 
PLAYED THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY AN 
OPTION YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO SCREW 
INTO THE BLUE MAYBE THAT IS A SHOT 
SOMETIMES THE OLD ADAGE IS THAT IF 
YOU DO NOT HAVE A GOOD SAFETY SHOT 
YOU MAY AS WELL GO FOR ONE 
HE IS 
LOOKING AT THE THIRD RED AGAIN 
WHICH IS POTTABLE IF HE HITS IT 
THICK HE GETS INTO THE BLACK EVEN 
IF HE MISSES THE POT HE WOULD DO 
WELL TO MISS THE REDS ON THE LEFT 
HAND SIDE WITH THE CUE POWER THAT 
MARK HAS GOT THE SCREW BACK DOWN 
THE CUSHION IS AS GOOD AS ANYTHING 
HE WAS JUST LOOKING AT GETTING THIS 
CUE BALL DOWN THERE WHICH IS NOT 
THAT EASY L. DON'T KNOW IF HE'S 
GOING TO DO IT BUT IF HE COULD GET 
IT THERE IT WOULD NOT BE TOO BAD 
HE HAS BEEN THINKING FOR QUITE SOME 
TIME MARK KING IS NOT A SLOW 
PLAYER BY ANY STRETCH OF THE 
IMAGINATION HE IS STILL NO NEARER 
THINKING WHICH IS THE EASIEST SHOT 
TO PLAY ONES HE GOING TO PLAY THE 
DEEP SCREW IS LOOKING AT THAT ONE 
NOW L. WONDER WHAT THE LONGEST TIME 
EVER BECAUSE PAUL IS DAVIS 
THORBURN OR HE STILL CUT SEEMED TO SEE A SHOT 
IF HE DOES GET NEAR THE POT HE 
MIGHT SCREW BACK INTO THE BLUE IT 
IS NO USE TO HIM 
AND THAT IS TERRIFIC WHAT A 
BLINDER WORTH THE WAIT PLAYED IN 
A GOOD SPIRIT THIS MAN PETER 
EBDON REALLY DID CONGRATULATE HIM 
ON THAT SHOT IT WAS SUCH A SMALL 
PATH BACK TO THE BAULK AREA 
TERRIFIC SHOT 
A LITTLE BIT TOO THIN THAT IS WHY 
IT HAS GONE WRONG MARK KING IS 
EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT HAS FORCED 
THE MISTAKE 
HE HAS GOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE NOW OF 
THIS GOOD OPPORTUNITY THAT HE GOT 
BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY SHOT THERE 
ARE FOUR REDS OPEN AND THAT WOULD 
BE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO CLINCH THE 
FAME FRAME 
WELL IT DID NOT LOOK GOOD UNTIL 
THEN 
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT JUST KEEPING 
THINGS SIMPLE 
ONE MORE RED AND COLOUR HE 
PLAYED A SAFETY SHOT BUT YOU CAN 
ONLY DREAM OF 
MARK KING OPENED THIS MATCH WITH A 
BREAK OF EIGHTY ONE 
EBDON DID THE SAME TO MARK KING IN 
THE SECOND FRAME THE STANDARD HAS 
BEEN GOOD NO CHANCE OF A CENTURY 
HERE OF COURSE NOT ENOUGH POINTS 
LEFT 
A FIFTY TWO BREAK PETER EBDON CONCEDED A 
GOOD SAFETY CREATED THE CHANCE IT 
MADE A FRAME WINNING VISIT TO THE 
TABLE MARK KING NOW TREATED TO UP 
AGAINST PETER EBDON TALK US 
THROUGH THE SAFETY SHOT WE HAVE A 
CHANCE OF SEEING THE SAFETY SHOT HE 
PLAYED HE LOOKED LONG 
PLAYED HE LOOKED LONG AND HARD THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND PRODUCED THIS 
ONE IT WAS PLAYED INCH PERFECT 
PETER EBDON JUST TAPPED THE TABLE 
AFTERWARDS WHICH ARE THOUGHT WAS 
NICE IT HAS BEEN A MATCH PLAYED IN 
GOOD SPIRIT A LITTLE BIT OF BANTER 
IN EARLIER IN THE MATCH EIGHTY OF THAT 
SHOT 
WE CAN SEE THE NEXT SHOT AND SHOT YOU WOULD THINK FROM THERE IT IS 
AN EASY SHOT TO PLAY OF THE RED 
NEXT TO THE PINK BUT HE PLAYED 
POORLY HE LEFT MARK KING THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A WONDERFUL 
BREAK OF FIFTY TWO WHICH WAS A FRAME 
WINNERS IT HAS BEEN A MATCH READY 
THAT THE STATISTICS SAY HAS BEEN 
CLOAKED SLOW BUT THERE HAVE BEEN 
TACTICAL EXCHANGES 
IT HAS BEEN A 
GOOD MATCH A GOOD FIVE FRAMES 
HAVE FELT PETER EBDON DID NOT 
PLAYED AT HIS BEST AGAINST JAMIE 
COPE BUT HE IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH 
PLAYER TO BEAT HE HAS GOT A 
TERRIFIC CHANCE HAS MARK KING OF 
GETTING IN THE TOP SIXTEEN THIS YEAR IT 
IS A FURTHER INCENTIVE FOR THEM 
MARK KING IS JUST COMING BACK INTO 
THE AUDITORIUM 
I THINK SOMEBODY IS IN THE WRONG 
SEAT AT THE MOMENT NOTHING TO 
WORRY ABOUT AT THE MOMENT IT 
DOESN'T MAKE DIFFERENCE WHERE 
THEY SAID WE ARE NOW DOWN TO THE 
ONE TABLE SITUATION BECAUSE THE 
OTHER MATCHES FINISHED YOU CAN SEE 
THE GREAT CRUCIBLE THEATRE HERE 
THERE IS NO PROBLEM 
MARK KING ONCE AGAIN BREAKS OFF 
POORLY THERE HAVE BEEN THREE BAD 
BREAK COSTS IN THIS MATCH BREAK 
OFF SPIN THIS MATCH 
HE HAS GOT THAT SHIFTY SHOT TO 
AVOID THE TO READ HE WOULD NOT 
WANT TO GO INTO THE RED TOO HEAVILY 
IN CASE SOMETHING GET PUSHED OVER 
HE DOES NOT HAVE TO PLAY THE SHOT 
BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY AN OPTION 
THERE ARE TWO OR THREE SAFETY SHOT SHOTS 
HE PROBABLY THOUGHT HE PLAYED A 
GOOD SHOT 
THESE TWO HAVE PLAYED EACH OTHER ON 
FIVE OCCASIONS OF WHICH PETER 
EBDON HAS WON THREE BUT THEY HAVE 
NOT PLAYED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
MARK IS JUST HAVING A LOOK AT THIS 
SHOT IF HE CAN JUST PLAY IN BEHIND 
THE RED AND PUSH IT UP THE TABLE 
IT WILL BE HANDY COULDN'T QUITE 
GET INTO IT ENOUGH NOT BAD THOUGH IS IT WORTH THE POT 
I AM NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED THERE 
HE MISSED THAT BY A WIDE WIDE 
MARGIN LET'S LOOK AT IT AGAIN L. 
DON'T THINK MARK WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
THIS AGAIN IT IS X. RATED L. DON'T 
KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM BUT 
OTHERWISE HE IS CUEING WELL 
HE DEVELOPED THE PINKS A COUPLE OF 
REDS AND HAS LANDED ON THE BLUE 
THAT HAS OPENED THE GAME UP BECAUSE 
WITH THE BLACK OUT OF PLAY IT IS 
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE WAS GOING 
TO SCORE VERY QUICKLY THE IDEA NOW 
IS TO GET ON TO THE PINK OR BLUE 
AND THE RED ON THE BLACK SPOT IS 
THE KEY TO THIS FRAME NOW HE NEEDS 
TO GET RID OF THAT 
IT KIND OF CLUNG TO THEM THAT CUE 
BALL AND THE BENEFIT IS THAT THE 
PINK GOES ON THE BLACK SPOT AGAIN 
YES I THINK HE MISS HIS IT HE IS 
ACTUALLY QUITE LUCKY THERE PLAYING 
AT THAT PACE THE REDS WERE NOT 
MOVED AWAY FROM THE PINK SPOT AND 
THE PINK WENT ON TO ITS OWN SPOT 
WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT IT WAS 
DIFFICULT AS IT HAPPENED THE RED 
PLAYED ON THE SPINK ON THE PINK 
SPOT THE DETERMINATION ON THIS 
MAN'S FACE AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU 
GET WHEN YOU WATCH PETER EBDON HE 
WON NO YOU KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO 
GET ONE OF THE MOST DETERMINED 
PLAYERS OF ALL TIME A WONDERFUL 
GUY OFF THE TABLE A GREAT CHAP TO 
TALK TO LOTS OF VARIOUS INTERESTS 
THE BLACK IS PLAYING NO PART IN 
THIS FRAME A TALL AT THE MOMENT 
AND THE PINK WILL GO BACK TO ITS 
OWN SPOT NOW AS WELL IT WILL MAKE 
THINGS SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT 
THIS TABLE IS VERY FAST AND I CAN 
ONLY PRESUME HE PLAYED FOR THE 
CORNER THERE L. DON'T THINK HE HAS 
GOT THEIR KICKS ON NOW IT LOOKS A 
BIT THIN THE CASE WHEN YOU ARE 
PLAYING ON FASTER TABLE YOU ARE 
SO FRIGHTENED SOMETIMES OF LOSING 
THE CUE BALL CAN HE HOLD IT THAT WAS A GREAT SHOT 
ONCE AGAIN IT SEEMS THAT ONE BREAK 
IS COSTING FIFTY PLUS BREAK NO 
PLAYER HAS YET OPENED UP TWO 
FRAME LEAD THIS NOW LOOKS LIKE 
ANOTHER TIME THAT HE IS GOING TO BE 
PEGGED BACK TO THREE TO THREE TWO MORE REDS 
AND COLOURS WILL BE ENOUGH PETER 
EBDON CAME INTO THIS MATCH I THINK 
AROUND FOUR TO NINE FAVOURITE WHICH IS ABOUT 
FAIR ON PREVIOUS VISITS TO THE 
CRUCIBLE L. WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH 
MARK KING'S VICTORY AGAINST MARK 
SELBY 
I THINK PETER EBDON CAN THANK 
HIMSELF QUITE FORTUNATE THINK 
HIMSELF 
HE NEEDS A GOOD SHOT TO KEEP THE 
BREAK GOING 
WELL IT IS PETER EBDON HIS HIGHEST 
BREAK OF THE MATCH SO FAR HE MADE 
A BREAK OF SEVENTY NINE IN WINNING A PREVIOUS 
FRAME FRAME IT IS FUNNY GENTLEMAN WHEN WE 
THINK ABOUT THE PATTERN OF THIS 
MATCH IT IS MARK KING WHO KEEPS 
EKING AHEAD IS THAT A PATTERN YOU 
EXPECT TO CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT 
FEW FRIENDS 
IT WAS NOT CERTAIN 
ALTHOUGH MARK KING TO SOME DEGREE 
HAS BECOME AN X. FACTOR WITH A 
FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE OF THE MARK 
SELBY WHAT WAS OBVIOUS IN THAT 
LAST FRAME WAS PETER EBDON WAS AT 
ITS CLINICAL BEST AND IF THAT 
CONTINUES HE IS A TOUGH MAN TO 
BEAT MARK IS KEEPING THINGS QUITE 
NICELY LEVEL 
JOHN YOU CAN AVOID 
PLAYERS FOR AGES AND IT IS THE 
FIRST TIME THESE PLAYERS HAVE MET 
FOR FOUR YEARS THE LAST TIME THAT 
MARK KING ACTUALLY BEAT PETER WAS 
SEVEN YEARS AGO 
HE CAN HAVE OTHER 
SEASONS WAY YOU TURN UP AT EVERY 
TOURNAMENT AND SEEMED TO PLAY THE 
SAME PLAYER THE DRAWERS ARE 
SUPPOSED TO BE RANDOM BUT I CAN 
REMEMBER PLAYING JAMES WATT AND 
THAT EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES A 
SEASON JAMES WATTANA 
IT IS 
WORTH SAYING WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR 
MARK KING AT THE MOMENT HE IS BACK 
INTO THE TOP SIXTEEN HOW IMPORTANT IS 
THAT IN A PLAYER'S LIFE IN TERMS 
OF GETTING THE TOURNAMENTS AND 
PROGRESSING THROUGH THEM STEVE IT IT IS A BIG DEAL AND CERTAINLY FOR 
MARK KING YOU COULD ARGUE IT IS A 
MASSIVE DEAL IN AS MUCH AS FOR A 
NUMBER OF YEARS YOU COULD PROBABLY 
HAVE ARGUED HE HAS BEEN CONSIDERED 
A JOURNEYMAN WITHIN THE GAME BUT WE 
KNOW HOW WELL HE IS AS A COMPETITOR 
AT HOW GOOD HE CAN PLAY HE CAN BE 
VERY PROUD OF HIMSELF IT IS TOUGH 
TO GET INTO THE TOP SIXTEEN OBVIOUSLY 
THERE ARE ONLY SIXTEEN PLAYERS IN IT HE HE IS OFF 
I CANNOT FOLLOW THE AMAZING 
WORLD OF STEVE DAVIS HERE LET'S LET'S GET BACK TO THE NEXT FRAME SHALL 
WE 
JUST A COUPLE OF FRAMES TO PLAY AND 
IT IS HARD TO SEPARATE THE TWO 
PLAYERS REALLY 
A VERY FIT MAN MARK KING HE PLAYS 
FOOTBALL IN HIS SPARE TIME HE 
LOOKS LIKE A CENTRE HALF YOU WOULD 
NOT WANT TO GO BY VERY OFTEN 
IN IT AGAIN IN THE REAL ADVANTAGE 
WITH THIS TYPE OF SHOT YOU NEVER 
GAIN ANY REAL ADVANTAGE AS YOU SEE 
THERE NO ADVANTAGE 
THERE IS SOMEBODY THAT HAS GOT A 
FULL HEAD OF HAIR 
JOHN VIRGO USED 
TO HAVE THAT YEARS AGO AND AFRO 
WITH A BIG MOUSTACHE AN AFRO 
IF THE BLACK IS AVAILABLE HE WILL 
GO ALL OUT FOR THIS TO GET A BLACK 
BUT AS IT IS NOT IT IS WORTH A 
RISK THIS IS A LITTLE BIT TRICKY 
OFF THE CUSHION GOOD SHOT WELL 
DONE THEY CAN MAKE YOU LOOK VERY 
SILLY IF YOU CATCH THEM THE WRONG 
SIDE 
HAWKEYE IS GOING TO SHOW US THE 
SORT OF SHOCK PETER IS LEFT WITH 
HE HAS GOT THE SAFETY SHOT WHICH HE 
CAN PLAY THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF 
DANGER ABOUT TAKING ON THE RED TO 
THE RIGHT CORNER 
THAT GENTLEMAN WAS THAT EVERY 
SINGLE SESSION OF LAST YEAR'S WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
HE LOVES HIS SNOOKER HE HAS GOT TO HIT THIS RATHER THICK 
JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO THIN THE 
GREEN MIGHT COME TO HIS RESCUE TOO 
HARD FOR THAT AS WELL THERE IS A 
POT ON BUT HAMPERED BY THE BROWN SO 
THAT IS TOO TOUGH TO TAKE ON 
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAN GOING 
OFF AND IT IS RATTLING THE JAWS AND 
LEAVING A RED ON HE WAS QUITE A 
LONG WAY OFF FROM WHAT HE PLAYED A A COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE MARK 
IS FACED WITH A VERY VERY LONGCOT 
LONG POT 
NOW THE SAFETY BECOMES EVEN MORE 
IMPORTANT 
THAT'S ONE OF THE STRONG POINTS OF 
PETER'S GAME WHEN HE CUES THOSE 
SHOTS IN 
IT'S JUST A BIT UNLUCKY HE FINISHED 
TWO NEAR THE CUSHION TO PLAY THE 
CANNON ON THE PINK 
NOT A GOOD CHANCE TO SCORE UNTIL HE 
BRINGS THE PINK OR BLACK INTO PLAY 
IT WILL BE HARD WORK AT THE MOMENT 
HOW MANY YEARS AGO DO YOU THINK IT 
WAS THAT PETER TURNED UP WITH THE 
PONY TAIL AND BEAT STEVE DAVIS IT 
WAS A LONG WHILE AGO DON'T LOOK AT 
YOUR PAPER 
I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE 
STATS I'M HAVING A THINK NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
I AM KEEPING IT A SECRET UNTIL 
AFTER THE SHOT AM STUNNED HOW 
FAR OUT YOU OFF IT IS NINETEEN NINETY TWO SIX 
YEARS AGO 
I THOUGHT IT WAS LESS 
THAN THAT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW 
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO 
THAT WAS A BAD GUESS WASN'T IT 
DON'T GIVE ME ANY MORE TRIVIA I'M 
NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT 
EVEN IF HE GETS THE PERFECT KISS 
THE BLACK AND PINK ARE STILL OUT OF 
PLAY 
IF THIS POTS THROUGH THE BLACK 
THOSE TWO REDS I WILL FORGIVE HIM 
FOR NOT PLAYING THE PINK 
HE HAS GONE TOO FAR ON THE BLUE HE 
CAN STILL POT IT THE WORRY IS 
ABOUT HOW TO STOP THE CUE BALL FROM 
TRAVELLING SO HE IS LOOKING AT 
PLAYING CANNON I THINK 
OTHERWISE THE CUE BALL HAS A LITTLE 
OUT OF CONTROL IS LITTLE 
THE PINK HASN'T COME INTO PLAY 
THAT ONE SHOT HAS NOW TATI'S CHANCE 
OF WINNING THE FRAME IN ONE VISIT 
HAS SCUPPERED HIS CHANCE THERE ARE MANY OPEN 
REDS EVEN 
THOUGH THE BLACK HAS GONE HE CAN 
STILL BUILD A HEALTHY LEAD FIVE 
OPEN REDS STILL 
ANOTHER FIVE REDS FIVE BLUES WOULD BE 
THIRTY POINTS FIFTY SEVEN IN FRONT AND THAT IS 
STILL NOT ENOUGH YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT 
TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AT THIS END 
OF THE TABLE AND KEEP THE BLACK AND 
PINK IN PLAY WHEN YOU CAN 
IF HE MAKES ANOTHER FORTY POINTS FROM 
HERE HE HAS DONE VERY WELL 
MISJUDGMENT THERE 
HORRIBLE SHOT ON THE BROWN HE'S 
GOT TO GET ALL KINDS OF GADGETS OUT 
FROM THE TABLE MAYBE A SPIDER OR 
AN EXTENSION OF SOMETHING MAYBE HE 
CAN GET THERE WITH THE REST BUT IT 
LOOKS LIKE THE GREEN IS IN THE WAY 
TO ME THE POT WAS ALL RIGHT HE 
JUST HIT THE KNUCKLE OF THE MIDDLE 
POCKET HE BELIEVES HE CAN GET TO 
THIS 
IT WAS JUST A CASE OF GETTING AWAY 
TRIED AND HE HASN'T GOT THE WEIGHT 
RIGHT GETTING AT THE WHITE RIGHT 
HE IS IN BIG BIG TROUBLE 
IT MIGHT JUST BE THAT SHOT HE'S 
LEFT WITH IF HE CAN GET PAST THE 
FIRST RED SO A DISAPPOINTING END 
TO THE BREAK 
MAYBE THE ANGLE IS A LITTLE BIT 
TIGHT TO GET PAST THE RED NEIL 
SAID IT WAS A PROBLEM AND I THINK 
IT IS PROBLEM HE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT WAS A 
CHANCE TO BUILD A FRAME WINNING 
LEAD HE COULD HAVE CERTAINLY GOT 
FIFTY ODD IN FRONT BEFORE HE HAD TO DO 
ANYTHING NOW THAT THIRTY POINT LEAD 
MEANS PRECIOUS LITTLE 
HE GOT HIMSELF IN THIS MESS AND HE 
HAS TAKEN QUITE A WHILE TO GET OUT 
OF IT 
THERE IS NOW A SAFE RED TO 
RESTON A RELIEF THERE IS NO 
SAFE RED TO REST ON REALLY 
A JOHN PARROTT IS ONE OF THE BEST I 
HAVE SEEN WITH HIS HAND ON THE 
CUSHION BUT 
MARK DOESN'T FANCY THIS MARK HAS GOT A CHANCE OF BRINGING 
EITHER THE PINK OR BLACK INTO PLAY 
WITH THE SAFETY IF HE CAN AVOID 
THE KISS ON THE YELLOW OR PINK BUT 
HE CAN'T PRETTY GOOD 
THE GOOD SAFETY SHOT FROM MARK 
NEARLY FORCED AN ERROR BECAUSE 
PETER HIT THAT TOO THICK 
HE PLAYED WITH JUST A TAD OF CHECK 
SIDE TO MAKE SURE GOODS GOOD 
SHOT 
THAT JUST STRAIGHTEN THE WHITE UP 
HE WOULD LOVE TO PLAY THE GREEN 
BUT CAN HE MISSED THE KISS ON PINK 
AND YELLOW TO PLAY FOR THE TWO REDS 
THAT ARE AVAILABLE ABOVE THE TWO 
REDS ABOVE THE BLACK IT IS A 
MASSIVE BALL THE YELLOW 
WHAT A CLEVER SHOT TO PLAY THAT IS 
HE PLAYED IT AROUND TWO CUSHIONS A 
BIT HARDER AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PERFECT 
HE HAS FINISHED AND A CHOICE OF 
THREE REDS 
PLAYING WITH A LOT OF TOP SPIN 
DECIDING HE CAN PLAY ON THE YELLOW 
THIS LOOKS A NATURAL UP AND DOWN 
NOTHING IN ITS WAY 
ANOTHER GREAT SHOT WHEN YOU HAVE 
TO TRAVEL THAT DISTANCE TO CONTROL 
THE CUE BALL IT IS VERY DIFFICULT 
THE MIDDLE RED OF THE BLACK AND RED 
IF HE RUNS THROUGH THAT DEAD 
STRAIGHT I THINK THE BLACK IS ON 
PETER REFUSED TO BE RINGED THE PINK 
INTO PLAY BEFORE AND SCORED THIRTY THREE TO 
BRING THE PINK 
HE SEEMED NOT HAPPY ABOUT SOMETHING 
THERE 
JUST WONDERING WHETHER HE IS ON 
THAT RED VERY ANIMATED AS USUAL 
IS MARK HAVING A WORD OR TWO WITH 
THE AUDIENCE AT THE CRUCIBLE HE 
KNOWS IT IS VERY VERY TIGHT 
IT IS ONE OF THOSE WHERE HE HAS TO 
PLAY WITH SIDE YOU CAN TRANSFER 
SIDE ON THESE BALLS YEARS AGO IT 
WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO HE WOULD 
REALLY LOVE TO TRY TO BEND THE CUE 
BALL ROUND THE BLACK THE SLOW WAY 
YOU PLAY THIS THE MORE CHANCE OF 
TURNING THE RED OVER THE SLOW WAY 
YOU PLAY SLOW WELL 
THE ANY ADVANTAGE OF THE SHOT IS HE 
IS VERY CLOSE TO THE CUE BALL 
THE ONLY ADVANTAGE 
IN THE END FUNNILY ENOUGH I THINK 
YOU RUSHED THE SHOT HE PLAYED OFTEN 
LOOKING AT THE OTHER ONE FOR SO 
LONG HE JUST GOT DOWN AND HIT THAT 
ONE 
DISAPPOINTING REALLY IT WAS A 
WONDERFUL CHANCE 
THIS IS THE SCRAPPY LIST FRAME OF 
THE MATCH THE MOST SCRAPPY FRAME 
IT IS TURNING INTO A TIGHT ONE 
WITH THE BALLS GOING AWKWARDLY 
HE DECIDED ON THE RUN THROUGH BUT 
AT LEAST THAT HAVE BROUGHT THE PINK 
INTO PLAY HE CAN'T AFFORD TO LEAVE 
A RED ON NOW 
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT HE KNEW THE 
CORK CUE BALL COULD BE TRAVELLING 
TO OUR LEFT THAT MEANT THE 
COLLISION WITH THE BROWN WHICH WAS 
FINE 
HE HAS MADE THINGS AWKWARD FOR MARK 
NOW 
IT IS SUCH AN EASY SAFETY SHOT TO 
FLICK OFF THE TWO REDS AT THE BACK 
AND GO UP TOWARDS BROWN AND YELLOW 
HE REALLY NEEDS TO GET RID OF THIS 
RED I SUGGEST RESTING ON THIS RED 
EVEN IF YOU ARE GOING OFF AT LEAST 
HE PUSHED THE RED SAFE BUT IT 
DIDN'T MATTER GOOD SHOT 
HERE IS THE SHOT THAT MARK KING IS 
FACED WITH 
HE MISSED THAT ONE BY QUITE A LONG 
WAY I THINK 
HE WAS CLOSER HITTING THE RED ON 
THE WAY BACK UP THERE HE MISSED IT 
BY ABOUT HALF AN INCH 
I WOULD BE 
AMAZED IF PETER DOESN'T PREDICT 
BACK IN AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS A 
REALLY TOUGH SAFETY SHOT HE WAS 
TRYING 
MAYBE PETER FANCIEST POTTING THE 
RED BUT FOR ME IT WAS ONLY FIFTY TO FIFTY 
FANCIES 
I THINK PETER WAS GIVING FANCIES IT THE TREATMENT THERE HE WAS 
PROBABLY ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE IT 
PUT BACK BUT THOUGHT HE WOULD LET 
MARK HAVE A THINK ABOUT THE LAST 
SHOT TAKING OUT OF HIS RHYTHM AND 
GET HIM BACK IN HIS CHAIR L. DON'T 
THINK PETER HAD ANY INTENTION OF 
PLAYING THAT LUCKY MAN 
HE HAS CERTAINLY PLAYED THE SAME 
SHOT THAT IS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS 
FOR MY MATCH REFEREES TO GET THE 
BALLS EXACTLY RIGHT FOUR OUR 
REFEREES 
ANOTHER CHANCE FOR MARK HE HAS 
CAUGHT THE RED TOO THICK 
THIS COULD BE THE FIRST TIME THAT 
SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SECOND FAVOURITE 
IN THE FRAME AND HAS GONE TO WIN IT 
MARK IS FAVOURITE NOW EVEN THOUGH 
HE WAS BEHIND EVERY OTHER FRAME 
THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN IN COMMAND HAS 
WON PETER HAS PLAYED A COUPLE OF 
STRAIN SHOTS BUT HE IS BLESSED 
WITH PLAYING BRILLIANT SHOTS AS 
WELL STRANGE SHOTS BUT YOU 
CAN'T WIN SEVENTH RANKING EVENT TITLES 
AND GET TO TWO MAJOR WORLD FINALS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU WERE DOING 
HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT SHOT AS USED 
ALL FROM HIS EXPRESSION AS YOU 
SAW 
LOOK HOW HIGH HE CUES AND AT THE 
LAST MINUTE HE JUST DIPS DOWN ON IT 
GOOD SHOT 
BOTH PLAYERS KNOW IT IS THE FIRST 
SESSION AND EITHER HAS A CHANCE OF 
FIVE TO THREE AND BOTH JUST STRUGGLING TO GET 
OVER THE LINE IN THIS FRAME THE 
LONGEST FRAME IN THE MATCH WAS THE 
THIRD FRAME BUT THIS HAS EVERY 
CHANCE OF ECLIPSING THAT FORTY ONE MINUTES 
PETER PLACE HIS BEST SNOOKER WHEN 
HIS AVERAGE SHOT TIME IS AROUND TWENTY FIVE 
TWENTY SIX SECONDS HE AVERAGED TWENTY THREE SECONDS 
WHEN HE WON IN THE U. K. FEW YEARS AGO 
HE IS BLESSED WITH WONDERFUL 
CONCENTRATION 
I DON'T SUPPOSE TOO MANY PEOPLE 
WILL FORGET THE MATCH WITH RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN THE MATCH ALL WEEK 
ALMOST GROUND TO A HALT BUT HE GOT 
THERE 
YES PETER GOT A LOT OF BAD THERE PRESS FOR THAT AND AT THE END OF 
THE DAY YOU DON'T PLAY INTO YOUR 
OPPONENT'S HANN'S AND I DON'T THINK 
HE PLAYED RIDICULOUSLY SLOW HE WAS 
REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THE GAME AND 
JUST TRYING TO PLAY AND STAY IN THE 
MATCH THAT IS AS BAD A SHOT AS HE 
HAS PLAYED FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
HE FELT HE WOULD TAKE HIS FAMILY TO 
DUBAI AND COMMUTE AS A SAID 
EARLIER HE IS A READINESS 
GENTLEMEN PETER EBDON L. HAVE A 
LOT OF TIME FOR HIM REALLY NICE 
GENTLEMAN THE BROWN IS BE 
GUARANTEED POSITIONAL SHOT BUT FOR 
THE PACE HE WILL NEED IT MIGHT NOT 
BE WORTH THE RISK HE NEEDS TO HIT 
THIS REALLY HARD TO SWING IT AROUND 
THREE CUSHIONS 
DO YOU THINK SOMETIMES YOU CAN 
OVER THINK UNDOUBTEDLY 
I THINK THE ONLY THING HE IS 
WORRIED ABOUT IF HE UNDER HITS IT 
AND SNOOKER'S HIMSELF IF THE BROWN 
WASN'T WHERE IT WAS HE WOULD TAKE 
THE PINK YOU KNOW THEY PLAYED 
JUST BEFORE THE JAWS OF THE MIDDLE 
CUSHION L. THINK THE BROWN AS A SHOT 
IT IS JUST A SIMPLE SHOT LIKE THAT 
IF HE IS INDEED SNOOKERED HE IS 
HAVING LOOK AT THE ANGLE 
SURELY HE COULD GET TO THE RED CAN 
HE CANNOT GET TO THE RED IF HE 
PLAYS THE SWERVE HE WILL HAVE WONDERFUL SHOT 
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A GAP THERE 
I'M AMAZED HE PLAYED THAT DID YOU 
SEE ANY SIGN OF GAP THERE BE A 
WASN'T ON 
IT WASN'T ON MARK IS 
LAUGHING BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE 
REFEREE IS GOING TO HAVE A JOB 
POTTING THE BALLS BACK 
WHAT IS 
PETER DOING HERE HE IS NOT 
THINKING OF PLAYING SAFE ON THE 
LAST RED WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE 
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE 
HE IS 
GIVING HIM THE TREATMENT HE IS 
GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE LOOK FIRST 
THERE IS NO WAY EBDON IS GOING TO 
PLAY THE SHOT UNLESS HE WANTS TO 
BE KIND TO THE REFEREE 
EVEN IF HE 
PUTS THE BALLS BACK IN THE WRONG 
PLACE HE IS STILL SNOOKERED WHAT 
YOU CANNOT DO IS PLAY THE SHOT 
IT IS TIME TO TURN IT IN IF HE 
DOES NOT HAVE THE BALLS REPLACED 
HE NEVER WAS GOING TO PLAY IT HE 
IS GIVING THE TREATMENT TO MARK HE 
WANTED TO KEEP HIM WAITING AND 
THINKING THE REFEREE HAD A BIT OF 
TIME TO FORGET WHERE THE BALLS WERE 
GOING TO BE PLACED HE MIGHT NEED A 
BIT OF HELP WHO WOULD BE A SNOOKER 
REFEREE EVERYTHING MOVED THAT IS 
NOT QUITE RIGHT BUT NOT ONE MILLION 
MILES AWAY 
HE HAS GOT TO GET THE WHITE AND THE 
BROWN RIGHT HE CAN PLAY IT OFF ONE 
CUSHION 
THE REASON I SAID HE MIGHT CUSHION PLATE TAKING ADVANTAGE IS BECAUSE 
THERE ARE THREE THINKS THAT MARK 
THINKS THERE IS A GAP THERE LOOK 
WHERE THE BALLS ARE NOW YOU COULD 
NOT GET A MATCHSTICK THROUGH THAT 
GAP DEFINITELY NOT THE CUE BALL 
SO THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT RIGHT AT 
THE MOMENT 
HE COULD NOT GET A CUE 
BALL THROUGH THEIR LAST TIME 
EITHER 
THERE IS NOT EVEN A GAP TO GET 
ANYTHING THROUGH AT THE MOMENT THE 
REFEREE SHOULD AT LEAST LOOK TO SEE 
THAT THERE WAS A SLIGHT GAP BEFORE 
I AM NOT GOING TO BLAME THE REFEREE 
THAT IS A REALLY TOUGH ONE FOR HIM 
TO PUT BACK IT WAS NOT LIKE THAT 
BUT THE SHOT THAT MARK HAD WAS NOT 
NICE EITHER MARK 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THERE FOR HIM TO 
GO THROUGH NO GAP THERE 
THE POINT IS THE MISS RULE IS 
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED 
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS WHERE IT 
GETS A BIT FARCICAL WELL ALL THE 
BALLS HAVE TO BE REPLACED GOING GOING BACK TO YOUR LINE THAT I'M SURE WE 
CAN PUT UP FOR YOU AGAIN THE ONE 
CUSHION ESCAPE IS A RELATIVELY 
STRAIGHTFORWARD MAYBE HE IS 
WORRIED ABOUT IT BEING AN EASY 
SNOOKER FOR PETER IT IS GOING TO 
BE HARD TO GET THE RED PASSED THE 
BLACK 
I AGREE BUT I THINK THE BLACK SHOT HE PLAYED ORIGINALLY HE 
COULDN'T GET 
SO AFTER ABOUT AN 
HOUR IT LOOKS AS IF HE IS PLAYING 
THE ONE CUSHION ESCAPE 
HAS HE MISSED THE BLACK HE HAS 
AND GOT A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE 
LOOKING AT CUSHION FIRST IF HE CAN 
GUARANTEE LEAVING THE WHITE WHERE 
THE RED IS THE RED IS GOING TO GO 
OFF TWO CUSHIONS NEAR THE BLACK 
AND THAT WOULD BE A SNOOKER HE HAS 
GOT TO HIT IT FULL BALL 
YOU CAN NEVER ACCOUNT FOR THAT THE 
ONLY SLIGHT PROBLEM WAS THAT MARK 
NEVER HIT THE RED AT ALL LIKE HE 
WANTED TO THE IN OFF IS VERY 
UNFORTUNATE HE IS TRYING TO LEAVE 
THE WHITE WHERE THE RED WAS 
PETER EBDON HAS GONE INTO ONE OF 
THOSE MOODS WHERE HE IS LIKELY TO 
DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY FROM MOST 
PLAYERS 
HE IS BLESSED WITH WONDERFUL 
CONCENTRATION WE HAVE HAD ABOUT FIFTEEN 
MINUTES OF SAFETY AND HE IS STILL 
ABLE TO PUT PAUL A POT OUT LIKE 
THAT 
THAT PUT HIM THIRTY IN FRONT SO HE 
DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY TOO MUCH 
HEROICS 
SO PETER EBDON LEFT THE YELLOW ON 
BUT HE WILL BE COMFORTED BY THE 
FACT THAT MARK KING NEEDS SNOOKER IN THE FRAME 
THIS NOW HAS BECOME THE LONGEST 
FRAME IN THE MATCH THERE HAS BEEN 
SOME DECENT SAFETY IN THIS FRAME 
THAT IS NOT A BAD KISS HE CAN GET 
THE WHITE IN BEHIND THE BROWN IT 
NOW WITHOUT THAT KISS IT WOULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN EASY 
PETER JUST SHOWING MARK HOW TO 
GET THE SNOOKER 
HE KNOWS HIS WAY 
AROUND PETER EBDON THAT WAS AN 
EXCELLENT SNOOKER HE PLAYED THERE 
MARK KING CONCEDES OF THE LONGEST 
FRAME OF THE MATCH GOES TO PETER 
EBDON 
YOU HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR QUITE A 
WHILE IT TOOK AN AGE BUT THE BALLS 
BACK AFTER AN INCIDENT IN THE FRAME 
THIS IS THE ROLE IN FULL FOR YOU 
AFTER A MISS HAS BEEN CALLED ARE 
REPLACING BALLS CAN BE THE REFEREES 
WORST NIGHTMARE 
BUT AFTER A MISS HAS BEEN CALLED 
THE BALLS HAVE TO BE REPLACED THE 
REFEREE IS THE ONLY PERSON ALLOWED 
TO TOUCH THE BALLS AT THE TABLE 
BOTH PLAYERS CAN ASSIST THE REFEREE 
BUT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH 
ANY BALL THAT IS ON THE TABLE IF 
THE PLAYER DOES TOUCHED A BALL HE 
WILL BE PENALISED WITHOUT AFFECTING 
THE ORDER OF PLAY DOUBLE TOUCH 
SHALL BE REPLACED BY THE REFEREE 
EVEN IF IT WAS PICKED UP OF THE 
TABLE THE BALL TOUCHED IF 
PLAYERS CANNOT AGREE TOOK THE 
POSITION OF CERTAIN BALLS THAN THE 
REFEREE'S DECISION WILL BE FINAL 
PETER AND MARK HAVE GONE OUT OF THE 
AUDITORIUM FOR A FEW MINUTES SO WE 
CAN TAKE A BIG CATCH UP ON THE 
PROGRESS OF AN ARTIST IN RESIDENCE 
HE HAS BEEN CREATING HIS SNOOKER 
MASTERPIECE SINCE SUNDAY HOW IS IT 
LOOKING 
I AM NOW FIVE DAYS INTO THIS EPIC 
PROJECT LET'S RECAP JUST BRIEFLY 
FROM THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT OF THE 
BIG BANG FROM WHICH EVERYTHING WAS 
BORN BILLIONS OF BALLS INCLUDED 
IT IS ALSO THE MATTER OF A CAVE 
THEN BELOW THAT WE HAVE AT THE 
BURIAL CHAMBER OF THE IRON AGE 
BRIGADE THAT WAS DISCOVERED 
UNDERNEATH AT THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE 
WHEN THEY BUILT IT HAVE NOW PUT 
THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE BACK ON TOP OF 
IT HERE IT IS SCREEN OUTSIDE 
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT 
THIS CRUCIBLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT 
THERE A VESSEL THAT HOLDS THE METAL 
THE GREAT METAL NOT TO POT IS 
GOING TO POUR ITS CONTENTS INTO THE 
SQUARE BELOW THE LYCEUM THEATRE 
THERE IT IS 
HE HAS GOT BRAIN LIKE A PLANET 
THAT MAN 
HERE IS THE VIEW OUR STUDIO WE 
ARE LOOKING OUT ON TWO TUDOR SQUARE 
THE LYCEUM IS ON YOUR RIGHT A FEW 
PEOPLE ARE GATHERING TO WATCH THE 
SNOOKER IT GOES ON DAY AND NIGHT 
THE PEOPLE OF SHEFFIELD CAN COME 
AND GO THERE AND HAVE A FEW DRINKS 
AND WATCH THE SNOOKER OUTSIDE WHEN 
IT IS NOT RAINING BACK WE GO INTO 
THIS SECOND ROUND MATCH THE LAST 
BALD COMPETITION I CAN REMEMBER WAS 
WILLIE THORNE AGAINST GRAEME MILES 
THAT WAS MY FIRST VISIT HERE HE 
ACTUALLY BEAT ME HE IS NOT IN THE 
BEST OF HEALTH AT THE MOMENT I'M 
SURE THE VIEWERS WOULD REMEMBER HIM 
FOR NOT ONLY PLAYING HERE BUT 
WINNING WILL POT BLACK ON A COUPLE 
OF OCCASIONS GREAT PLAYER WE WISH 
YOU WELL 
GOOD OPENING RED PETER EBDON IS 
LEADING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS 
MATCH HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT EVERY 
FRAME IS THE PINK IS AVAILABLE AS 
WELL AS THE BLUE 
THIS IS A CHANCE NOW BECAUSE THE 
BLACK IS POTTABLE EVERY FRAME IS 
DIFFERENT THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS 
GAME SO BEAUTIFUL 
THIS RED WILL BE HANDY TO GET OUT 
OF THE WAY FOR PETER 
DEVELOPED A COUPLE OF REDS THERE 
IT WAS A GOOD CHANCE TO DO IT 
HAVING COMMITTED ON EVERY FRAME IT 
WOULD BE PROBABLY THE BEST EBDON 
COULD HAVE GOT OUT OF THE SESSION 
LEAVING NARROWLY L. THINK MARK KING 
HAS PLAYED VERY WELL LEADING 
NARROWLY 
I AGREE HE HAS LOOKED NARROWLY GOOD BUT WITH PETER EBDON IT YOU 
KNOW YOU HAVE TO SCRAP OUT THE 
FRAMES 
MARK CAN DO THAT BUT SOME THINGS 
HAVE GONE AGAINST HIM SOMETIMES 
AFTER A LONG BOUT OF SAFETY IN A 
SCRAPPY FRAME IT TAKES THE EDGE 
OFF YOUR THINKING BUT WITH PETER 
IT SEEMS TO MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE 
A LITTLE SHAKE OF THE HEAD FROM 
PETER YOU DO NOT GET MUCH EMOTION 
FROM HIM YOU GET PLENTY FROM HIS 
OPPONENT BUT NOT MUCH FROM HIM 
WHY DOES HE NOT LIKE THIS SHOT IT 
LOOKED O. K. THAT RED WILL POT NO 
PROBLEM IN THAT RESPECT 
GOING INTO THE REDS NEEDS A BIT OF 
LUCK HE PLAYED IN SUCH A WAY 
GUIDING THE CUE BALL BACK 
CERTAINLY ANY OF THE BAULK COLOURS 
TO PLAY IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE 
ALIVE YELLOW 
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE IS GETTING 
THROUGH THE BALL WELL I DON'T 
THINK THE RED NEAREST THE BLACK 
WILL POT HE PLAYED FOR THE TOP RED 
OF THOSE TWO IF HE DECIDES TO PLAY 
IT NOW HE CANNOT AVOID THE PACK 
HE GOT THE WHITE PERFECT BUT 
FORGOT TO POT A REPRIEVE FROM MARK 
KING FOUR KING 
I WONDER IF MARK KING'S OF 
ATTRITION HAS JUST GIVEN AWAY FOR 
THE DAY CONCENTRATION 
YOU JUST FEEL THAT PETER IS 
STARTING TO GET THE UPPER HAND 
HE TIMED THAT ONE NICELY YOU GET 
THE FEELING THAT HE WILL SCORE 
ENOUGH TO WIN THE FRAME 
THIS IS A GOOD CHANCE IT WOULD NOT 
BE NECESSARILY A REFLECTION OF THE 
SESSION IF PETER TOOK A FIVE TO THREE LEAD L. 
THINK MARK KING HAS CUED VERY WELL 
ESPECIALLY EARLY ON BUT HE KNOWS 
AGAINST EBDON THAT HE'S GOING TO 
HAVE TO CONCENTRATE FOR LONG TIME 
AND IT IS NOT EASY TO DO IT HAS 
GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR STILL GOT A 
CUTBACK BLACK BUT THE CUE BALL WAS 
RUNNING AROUND A BIT 
THAT WAS I SHOT THAT WAS A NICE 
SHOT HE PLAYED IT QUITE SLOWLY 
AND HAS JUST LOST THE WHITE A 
LITTLE BIT YES I THINK THE PIT 
CAUGHT PINK WILL POT IN THE 
MIDDLE BUT TO BE ABLE TO STUN IT A 
BIT THIS IS TOUGH THIS IS NOT 
MORE THAN ABOUT SEVENTY TO THIRTY IN HIS FAVOUR 
HE HIT IT THICK BUT GOT THROUGH 
THE CUE BALL BEAUTIFULLY 
THAT IS 
AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT SHOT 
PLAYED IT WITH TOP SPIN A LOT OF 
THINGS COULD HAVE GONE ROAR BUT 
THAT WAS A BEAUTY COULD HAVE 
GONE ALL WRONG SO THIS IS FRAME BALL 
MARK KING HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO COME 
BACK TO THE TABLE LONG MATCH LOT 
STILL TO PLAY FOR 
BUT IT IS GOING TO BE PETER EBDON 
THAT TAKES THE OVERNIGHT LEAD 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PREDICTIONS 
ABOUT THIS YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIPS 
PLAYERS THAT ARE IN THE HUNT IT 
MIGHT BE AN OPEN YEAR BUT I 
HAVEN'T HAD TOO MANY PEOPLE 
FLAGGING UP THE CHANCE OF EBDON 
YOU KNOW YOU WILL GET A RUN FOR 
YOUR MONEY 
YOU KNOW WITH HIM HE IS PREPARED 
HE IS BOOKED IN FOR TWO AND A HALF 
WEEKS 
YOU FEEL THAT HE IS STARTING TO CUE 
BETTER AND BETTER YOU COULD ARGUE 
THAT HE WAS LUCKY AGAINST JAMIE 
COPE IN THE FIRST ROUND HE COULD 
HAVE LOST IN THE FIRST FRAME 
PETER EBDON WAS THREE TO TWO DOWN BUT HAS 
WON THE LAST THREE FRAMES 
FINISHING OFF WITH THIS BREAK OF EIGHTY FOUR 
THEY WILL BE BACK IN THE MORNING 
FOR THEIR SECOND SESSION FINISHING 
THIS MATCH IN THE EVENING LET ME 
UPDATE YOU ON THE PROGRESS OF 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HE COMPLETED HIS 
FIRST ROUND WINNER OVER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
CHINESE ROCKET LIU CHUANG THIS 
AFTERNOON IT WAS TEN TO FIVE THIS WAS 
HIS REACTION AFTER HE WRAPPED IT UP 
IT HAS BEEN THERE WHERE PLAYED ALL 
SEASON NOT FANTASTIC BUT NOT 
TERRIBLE I HAVE MADE WILL HAVE TO 
ALTERATIONS TO MY GAME WHICH I 
DON'T SEEM TO BE FLYING AS MUCH AS 
I USED TO BUT BLOMME SEEMS TO BE 
MORE OF A MIDDLE GROUND IT STOPS 
THE ANXIETY SO MUCH IF YOU ARE NOT 
PRODUCING THE THE LEVEL OF 
PERFORMANCE ARE CAPABLE OF THERE 
IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WRONG YOU 
HAVE TO KEEP CERTAIN AND YOU NEVER 
STOP LEARNING IN THIS GAME L. KNEW 
SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT IT SEEMS 
TO HAVE STEADIED THE SHIP A LITTLE 
BED I'M NOT FLYING SO MUCH AS I 
SAY BUT IT HAS GIVEN ME MORE OF 
MIDDLE GROUND SO IT IS EITHER 
FLYING NOW AND AGAIN AND PLAYING 
OFF FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME 
OR PLAYING STEADY THEN THE RESULTS 
HAVE BEEN MORE CONSISTENT THAT IS 
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AT TOP 
LEVEL STOKER OR ANYTHING IT IS 
THAT CONSISTENCY WHICH YOU CAN 
BUILD ON 
WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE YOU WITH 
MEMORIES OF THE JET WE MENTIONED 
EARLIER ON OUR BEST WISHES GO TO 
GRAEME MILES 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET 
YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
