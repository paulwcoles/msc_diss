IT'S BEEN DECIDE HE IS ABLE TO 
COMPETE AGAINST ABLE BODIED 
ATHLETES HES BANNED IN THE PAST 
BECAUSE PEOPLE THOUGHT THE BLADES 
MADE HIM UNFAIRLY QUICK 
NOW TO BURMA IN SOUTH EAST ASIA 
WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
CYCLONE CYCLONE NARGIS DEVASTATED 
THE COUNTRY WE ARE ABLE TO HEAR 
FROM SURVIVORS IN SOME OF THE WORST 
AFFECTED AREAS VILLAGES ALONG THE 
IRRAWADDY DELTA ARE NOT GETTING AS 
MUCH AID AS THE GOVERNMENT THERE IS 
MAKING OUT 
THIS THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOY IS ALONE AND 
WAITING FOR HELP HE IS THE ONLY 
MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY THAT SURVIVED 
CYCLONE NARGIS HE CLUNG TO A TREE 
FOR FOURTEEN HOURS WATCHING AS THE STORM 
SWEPT AWAY HIS HOME FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE 
USED TO LIVE IN THIS VILLAGE TWENTY 
SURVIVED THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO 
COPE LIVING OFF RAIN WATER AND 
RICE SHELTERING IN THE ONE 
BUILDING LEFT STANDING HARDLY 
ANYONE KNOWS HOW DIFFICULT LIFE HAS 
BEEN FOR SURVIVORS SINCE THE STORM 
THAT IS BECAUSE THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT IS VERY SECRETIVE AND 
HAS STOPPED REPORTERS GOING INTO 
THE COUNTRY TO FIND OUT HOW PEOPLE 
ARE COPING SOME PICTURES OF THE 
DEVASTATION ARE STARTING TO COME 
OUT AID WORKERS ARE DESPERATE TO 
GET IN AND HELP BUT THEY ARE NOT 
ALLOWED THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT SAY 
IT WILL HELP ITS OWN PEOPLE THROUGH 
THE CRISIS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE 
SURVIVORS AREN'T COPING AS WELL AS 
THE GOVERNMENT ARE MAKING OUT 
WE ARE STARVING FOR A FEW DAYS GOVERNMENT HELICOPTERS 
THROUGH OVER US WE WAVED AND 
SHOUTED BUT NOTHING HAPPENED 
AID WORKERS AROUND THE WORLD ARE 
ANGRY AT HOW THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT 
IS BEHAVING FOR THIS LITTLE BOY 
AND TENS OF THOUSANDS LIKE HIM THE 
WAIT FOR HELP COULD BE A LONG ONE 
MORE HEADLINES THERE ARE REAL 
WORRIES FOR WILDLIFE TODAY THE 
ANIMAL CHARITY W. W. F. HAS SAID THE 
NUMBER OF ANIMALS ON THE EARTH HAS 
REDUATIONED BY A QUARTER IN THE 
LAST FORTY YEARS REDUCED THEY SAY 
IT'S BECAUSE ANIMALS A NATURAL 
HABITATS ARE BEING DESTROYED DO
