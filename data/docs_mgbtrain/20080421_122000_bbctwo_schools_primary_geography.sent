HELLO AND WELCOME TO POSTCARDS FROM KENYA 
TODAY WE'LL BE LOOKING AT WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN THE TOWNS OF URBAN KENYA 
LET'S VISIT NAANA 
WHO LIVES WITH HER PARENTS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL NAIROBI 
AS YOU WATCH THINK HOW HER DAY COMPARES TO YOUR DAY 
I GET UP AT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY 
I GET WASHED 
AND I PUT ON MY SCHOOL UNIFORM 
I GO DOWNSTAIRS AND WE HAVE OUR BREAKFAST TOGETHER 
ALL THE FAMILY SIT DOWN TOGETHER 
WE USUALLY HAVE FRUIT JUICE FRUIT CEREAL AND TEA OR COFFEE 
IF IT'S COLD OUTSIDE WE HAVE PORRIDGE 
THEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL 
MY SCHOOL IS FAR SO I CAN'T WALK 
MUM AND DAD TAKE US IN THE CAR 
ON THE WAY WE PASS THROUGH A SMALL FOREST AND THEN WE MEET THE HEAVY TRAFFIC 
NAANA NAANA 
WHEN THE BELL RINGS WE LINE UP FOR ASSEMBLY IN THE YARD 
SHHH STAND AT ATTENTION 
HANDS BY YOUR SIDES 
THE FLAG'S RAISED AND THEN WE SING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM 
EE MUNGU NGUVU YETU 
ILETE BARAKA KWETU 
HAKI IWE NGAO NA MLINZI 
NATUKAE NA UDUGU AMANI NA UHURU 
RAHA TUPATE NA USTAWI 
AT LUNCH TIME WE ALL GO INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE SOME PEOPLE HAVE SCHOOL LUNCH 
AND OTHERS HAVE HOME LUNCH THAT THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN 
WE GIVE YOU THANKS ALMIGHTY GOD 
FOR THIS AND OTHER BENEFITS 
AFTER LUNCH WE HAVE MORE LESSONS THIS IS MY ENGLISH CLASS 
SO THE SENTENCE NOW COMPLETE 
WHAT'S THE ANSWER 
FRO TO AND FRO 
SAFE AND SOUND 
IT'S FOUR O'CLOCK AND SCHOOL'S OVER FOR ME SOME PEOPLE GO ON THE SCHOOL BUS 
EVERYONE ELSE GOES UP TO THE BIG PLAYING FIELD TO WAIT TO BE COLLECTED 
WHEN I COME HOME FROM SCHOOL 
I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT OR TO DRINK THEN I HAVE A BATH THEN I START MY HOMEWORK 
I USUALLY HAVE A LOT OF HOMEWORK 
SOMETIMES IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET IT ALL DONE 
NEIGHBOURS EVERYBODY NEEDS GOOD NEIGHBOURS 
WITH A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING 
YOU CAN FIND THE PERFECT BLEND 
AFTER NEIGHBOURS MY BROTHERS AND I GO TO THE VIDEO SHOP ROUND THE CORNER 
SO THAT'S A TYPICAL DAY IN THE LIFE OF NAANA 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT HOW PEOPLE LIVE IN THE TOWNS AND CITIES 
WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO NAANA'S HOUSE IN NAIROBI 
LIKE MANY CITIES FEW PEOPLE LIVE IN THE CENTRE MOST LIVE FURTHER OUT NAANA'S HOUSE IS IN A QUIET STREET 
SURROUNDED BY MANY OTHER SIMILAR HOUSES 
THERE'S VERY LITTLE TRAFFIC ON THIS STREET 
I LIVE HERE WITH MY MUM MY DAD AND MY TWO BROTHERS 
COME IN 
THIS IS THE SITTING ROOM 
THIS IS MY MUM'S OFFICE WHERE SHE DOES HER WRITINGS 
THIS IS OUR PARROT SNIPE 
THIS IS THE KITCHEN 
WE'RE NOW GOING TO THE BEDROOMS 
THIS IS MY BEDROOM 
THIS IS A T. V. ROOM WHERE MY BROTHERS PLAY 
THIS IS MY BROTHER'S ROOM 
RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN WE'VE GOT LOTS OF TREES 
LIKE BANANA 
AVOCADO 
AND MANGO 
WE'VE ALSO GOT LOTS OF FLOWERS WHICH I REALLY LIKE 
IT APPEARS THAT SOME OF THE HOUSES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWNS AND CITIES IN KENYA ARE MUCH BIGGER 
THAN HOUSES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWNS AND CITIES IN BRITAIN 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT TRAVEL 
WATCH THIS SEQUENCE TO FIND OUT 
YOU CAN WALK 
OR TAKE A BUS 
THERE ARE COMMUNAL TAXIS THAT ARE SHARED BY MANY PEOPLE 
AND THERE ARE MORE EXPENSIVE PRIVATE TAXIS FOR JUST ONE OR TWO PEOPLE 
THESE ARE MORE LIKE TAXIS FOUND IN BRITAIN 
YOU CAN ALSO TAKE TRAINS 
AS WELL AS FLY 
SO GETTING AROUND URBAN KENYA IS NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM GETTING AROUND BRITAIN 
BUT ARE BUSES IN YOUR TOWN AS BUSY AS THE ONES WE'VE SEEN IN KENYA 
GOODBYE 
SUBTITLES BY E. KANE B. B. C. BROADCAST TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY

YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP
