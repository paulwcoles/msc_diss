HELLO WELCOME TO THE DAILY 
POLITICS PREPARE FOR BATTLE YES 
IT'S ELECTION DAY TOMORROW THAT'S 
ONE BIG STORY THE OTHER ONE IS 
THAT AL LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY SEEM 
TO BE INTERESTED IN WHAT HAPPENS 
BORIS OR KEN LONDON ISN'T BIG 
ENOUGH FOR THE BOTH OF THEM ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES WILL IT BE GLAD 
CONFIDENT MORNING FOR GORDON OR THE 
START OF HIS LONG DAY'S JOURNEY 
INTO NIGHT WE'LL GIVE YOU THE LOW 
DOWN DOWN EXPECT SOME PUNCH AND JUDY POLITICS 
AT PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS 
DAVID CAMERON ADMITS HE JUST CAN'T 
GIVE IT UP BUT IS HE PUNCH OR 
JUDY JUDY WE REVEAL THE RESULTS OF THE MOST 
UNSCIENTIFIC POLL OF ALL TIME 
GUESS WHAT'S IT'S ON POLLING 
PETER SNOW WILL BE SWINGING LIVE IN 
THE STUDIO 
ADD THE CHILDREN'S AUTHOR ANTHONY 
HOROWITZ TELLS US WHY HE THINKS THE 
GOVERNMENT IS FAILING TO TAKE AT 
LEAST ONE OF THE THREE R.'S SERIOUSLY 
IT'S A BIG MISTAKE TO TREAT BOOKS 
LIKE MEDICINE OR VITAMINS TO MAKE 
BETTER PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME I 
PASSIONATELY BELIEVE THAT READING 
AND LITERACY CAN BE AN ANSWER TO 
MANY SOCIETY'S PROBLEMS 
ALL OF THAT COMING UP IN THE NEXT 
HOUR AND A HALF I DON'T KNOW HOW 
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CONTAIN 
YOURSELVES IT'S GOT THE BETTER OF 
ANDREW HE'S HAD TO LEAVE THE 
STUDIO JOKING HE'S FINE REALLY 
DON'T WORRY WITH US FOR THE WHOLE 
PROGRAMME IS LABOUR PEER BARONESS 
JAY AND CONSERVATIVE LEADER OF THE 
LORD'S LORD STRATHCLYDE WELCOME 
TO YOU BOTH NOTHING BUT THE BEST 
FOR YOU THIS MORNING FIRST OF ALL 
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING CLOSE TO 
MANY PEOPLE'S HEARTS SOME WOULD 
SAY IT BORDERS ON NATIONAL 
OBSESSION HOUSE PRICES ACCORDING 
TO THE LATEST FIGURES THEY'VE SHOWN 
THEIR FIRST ANNUAL FALL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
THEY'RE ONE PER CENT LOWER THAN THIS TIME 
LAST YEAR THIS MORNING GORDON 
BROWN SAID HIS PRIORITY WAS TO LEAD 
BRITAIN THROUGH ITS CURRENT 
ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES BY UNBLOCKING 
THE MORTGAGE MARKET TO DEAL WITH 
ANY FALL IN HOUSE PRICES 
MY AIM 
AND MY PRIORITY IS THAT WE CAN LEAD 
PEOPLE IN BRITAIN THROUGH THIS 
ECONOMIC PROBLEM AND DO SO BY 
TAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS TO GET 
LIQUIDITY TO THE BANKS TO MAKE 
SURE THE HOUSING MARKET STARTS 
MOVING AGAIN AND WE HAVE THE HOUSE 
PRICE FIGURES ANNOUNCE TODAY WHICH 
WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH 
SHOULD IT 
BE THE GOVERNMENT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE 
FOR DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET ARGUABLY CREDIT 
HAS BEEN TOO CHEAP FOR TOO LONG AND 
IT WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE FOR 
THE GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN 
IT IS 
THE TIME TO HAVE A MORE SENSIBLE 
APPROACH TO MORTGAGES AND HOUSE 
PRICES THE PROBLEM IS THAT SO MANY 
PEOPLE FEEL THAT THIS IS A HIGH 
PRIORITY IN THEIR OWN LIFE THAT 
WHEN THEY FEEL THEY'RE IN TROUBLE 
THEY FEEL THE GOVERNMENT MUST ACT 
WHAT GLOUN WAS SAYING AND I WAS 
INTERESTED TO SEE THAT ON YOUR 
PIECE OF FILM IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE 
WAS TALK TO JIM NOCTY I THOUGHT IT 
WAS HUMPHREYS IN A WAY ONE OF THE 
THINGS HE HOPES FOR IS THAT THE 
BISH ECONOMY WHICH HE EXPECTS 
WILL NOT GO THE WAY OF THE AMERICAN 
MARKET INTO RECESSION BOTH THE 
MARKET WILL REBALANCE IN TERMS OF 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE GOVERNMENT 
MAY NEED TO INTERVENE BUT IT ISN'T 
NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 
SUCH A HUGE CRISIS AS IT IS IN 
PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SHOULD WE FEAR FALLING HOUSE PRICES 
THOUGH FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT 
WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR FIRST 
TIME BUYERS FOR PEOPLE TRADING UP 
I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT 
YOU CAN OF COURSE WELCOME LOWER 
HOUSE PRICES BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
YOU DON'T WANT TIGHTENING CREDIT 
MARKET YOU DON'T WANT A SITUATION 
WHERE ALTHOUGH YOU LOOK AT A HOUSE 
AS A FIRST TIME BUYER IT LOOKS 
MORE REASONABLE NO ONE'S GOING TO 
LEND YOU THE MONEY EXCEPT ON 
EXORBITANT RATES OR WITH MAJOR 
DOWN PAYMENT THAT'S THE THING THAT 
MANY STRUGGLE WITH AFFORDABILITY AFFORDABILITY AT THE MOMENT IS SO OUT OF KILTER 
QUITE 
YOU HAVE TO BORROW AN QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT TO GET ON THE 
LADDER 
THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU TALK LADDER ABOUT FALLING HOUSE PRICES YOU HAVE 
TO EQUATE IT WITH TIGHTENING CREDIT 
AND THE TIGHTENING MORTGAGE MARKET 
IF YOU HAD A RELAXED MORTGAGE 
MARKET IN THE WAY WE'VE SEEN OVER 
MANY YEARS AND FALLING HOUSE PRICES 
MOST TRYING TO GET ON THE LADDER 
WOULD BE ONLY TOO PLEASED WOT WOT TORIES BE INTERFERE INTERFERING 
IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET OR LET 
CAPITALISM RULE 
MARGARET MAKES IT 
SOUND AS THOUGH GORDON BROWN AND 
THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT HAVE HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF THIS OVER 
THE COURSE OF THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE 
YEARS THERE'S A FEEL OF GOING BACK 
TO THE SEVENTIES WE'VE SEEN STRIKES OF 
TEACHERS OIL REFINERIES ROCKETING 
OIL PRICES NOT ALL OF THIS IS DUE 
TO DECISIONS THAT GOVERNMENT HAS 
MADE TEN YEARS AGO GORDON BROWN 
CAME TO GOVERNMENT HE PROMISED US 
THE END OF BOOM AND BUST WE HEAR 
VERY MUCH ABOUT BOOM AND BUST THIS 
MORNING ON THE RADIO SHOW YET 
DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS WHEN 
THERE HAS BEEN GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH 
NOTHING WAS PUT ASIDE FOR THE RAINY 
DAY THAT IS THE PROBLEM OF WHY WE 
FIND OURSELVES IN THIS STATE 
INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS WHO 
LOOK AT BRITAIN U. K. P. L. C. AND SAYING 
HANG ON WE DON'T LIKE THE WAY THIS 
HAS BEEN RUN 
GORDON BROWN WHENEVER 
HE TALKS ABOUT THIS MAKES IT VERY 
CLEAR THAT HE THINKS THE CRISIS 
STARTED IN AMERICA YOU'RE SAYING 
IT'S MORE HIS FAULT 
THE CRISIS MAY 
WELL HAVE STARTED IN THE UNITED 
STATES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS 
UNDOUBTEDLY THE WIND HAS BLOWN 
TOWARDS US WHY IS IT THAT WE HAVE 
THE COUNTRY WITH THE LARGEST 
DEFICIT IN EUROPE IN FACT MOST OF 
THE REST OF THE CIVILISED WORLD WE 
HAVE A LARGER DEFICIT AND HIGH TAX 
RATES WE NOW HAVE HIGH INTEREST 
RATES OUR EXCHANGE RATE HAS 
SLUMPED TO SOME EXTENT THAT MAY BE 
QUITE A GOOD THING THANK GOODNESS 
WE DIDN'T JOIN THE EURO WHEN IT WAS 
PROMISED TO US 
A WHOLE ANOTHER 
TOPIC WE MUST MOVE ON 
YOU ASKED 
ABOUT HOUSE PRICES ARE THEY 
IMPORTANT THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT 
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT HOUSES 
WHO ARE FRANTIC ABOUT AFFORDING 
THEIR MORTGAGES ARE TERRIFIED ABOUT 
WHAT'S GOING O. TO HAPPEN AND 
GOVERNMENTS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY 
ALREADY COMING IN WE KNOW GORDON 
BROWN IS ANXIOUS TO KEEP PUBLIC 
SECTOR PAY UNDER CONTROL AS WELL AS 
THE HOUSING MARKET SO KEEN HE'S 
BLOCKED A ONE POINT FIVE OH RISE FOR PRISONERS 
WHO WORK THE INCREASE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN THE FIRST IN MORE THAN TEN 
YEARS FOR AND WAS MEANT TO 
BE A MORALE BOOSTING INCENTIVE 
BARONESS JAY IT LOOKS WEAK DOESN'T 
IT THE PRIME MINISTER ONLY CHANGED 
HIS MIND IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS I I DON'T THINK HE CHANGED HIS MIND 
GOING BACK TO THE INTERVIEW YOU 
QUOTED EARLIER I HEARD HIM SAY IN 
THAT INTERVIEW HE HAD IT ON HIS 
DESK YESTERDAY WHICH DOESN'T 
SURPRISE ME 
SO HE DIDN'T KNOW 
I HOPE HE DIDN'T GET DOWN INTO THE 
NITTY GRITTY OF INDIVIDUAL PAY 
ARRANGEMENTS VIS A VIS THE HOME 
OFFICE AND PRISON SERVICE THAT 
WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE 
PRIME MINISTER THE POINT IS THAT 
IT WAS IT CAME TO HIM YESTERDAY 
HE DECIDED THIS WAY CAN I GO BACK 
THOUGH TO SOMETHING TOM WAS SAY 
ANYTHING RELATION TO THE PREVIOUS 
QUESTION I THINK THAT ONE OF THE 
REASONS WHY GORDON BROWN IS 
CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL WEATHER THIS 
ECONOMIC SITUATION BETTER THAN THE 
AMERICANS IS BECAUSE OF THE 
ENORMOUS STABILITY OF THE 
UNDERLYING ECONOMY PARTICULARLY 
THE LABOUR MARKET PEOPLE ARE IN 
JOBS THERE'S NO QUESTION THEY'RE 
GOING 
ON THIS ISSUE OF PUBLIC 
SECTOR PAY LET'S CONCENTRATE ON 
THIS 
IT IS THE UNDERLYING ECONOMY THIS ONE SHOULD LOOK AT 
GOVERNMENT HAS 
TRIED TO KEEP TO TWO PER CENT ON PUBLIC 
SECTOR PAY DEALS AND THEY HAVEN'T 
MANAGED THAT ON SOME OF THEM HERE 
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TINY 
INCREASE WHICH THE PRISON SERVICE 
BELIEVED WOULD HAVE MADE A BIG 
CHANGE THEY BACK TRACKED AT A VERY 
LAST MINUTE 
AS I UNDERSTOOD IT I 
HEARD ABOUT IT THIS MORNING WAS 
THAT IT CAME TO THE PRIME MINISTER 
YESTERDAY HE THOUGHT THIS WAS 
INAPPROPRIATE IT'S SYMBOLIC AND HE 
MADE THE DECISION NOT TO DO IT I 
DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY 
INCONSISTENT 
MIGHT IT HAVE BEEN A INCONSISTENT GOOD IDEA THE PRISON SERVICE 
BELIEVE TODAY WOULD HAVE WORKED 
IT'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN 
PERCENTAGE TERMS THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT 
THE TIME THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS ASKING FOR 
PAY RESTRAINT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR 
RIGHTLY I THINK IF THERE'S SPARE 
MONEY AROUND WE NEED TO LOCK AFTER 
PRISON OFFICERS' PAY WHAT WORRIES 
ME ABOUT THIS TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE SOME 
VERY SERIOUS LOCAL ELECTIONS IN 
LONDON AND ELSEWHERE THIS STORY IS 
PULLED BY THE PRIME MINISTER 
THERE'S NO COMMITMENT IT'S NOT 
GOING TO BE BROUGHT BACK IN A 
MONTH'S TIME THERE ARE REAL 
PROBLEMS OF PRISONS AND PRISONERS 
NO ONE DISAGREE WAS THAT 
WE NEED 
TO LOOK MUCH MORE CAREFULLY ABOUT 
REHABILITATION DRUG OFFENDER AND 
ALL OF THAT BEFORE DEALING WITH 
THIS ISSUE 
IN THAT CASE DO YOU 
BELIEVE THIS WAS PULLED AT THE LAST 
MINUTE FOR FEAR OF NEGATIVE 
ELECTION SNZ YES 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE YES OF THAT YOU THINK THE PRIME 
MINISTER SHOULDN'T BE MICROMANAGING 
AT THIS LEVEL 
I SAID WHAT I SAID 
AND I STICK TO IT I DON'T THINK 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY TO BELIEVE THAT 
SOMETHING OF THIS KIND DIDN'T REACH 
HIS DESK UNTIL YESTERDAY IT WOULD 
BE SOMETHING DEALT WITH BY 
DEPARTMENTAL MINISTERS ETC THAT'S 
APPROPRIATE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPROPRIATE NOW EVERYONE HERE AT THE DAILY 
POLITICS IS VERY EXCITED AT THE 
MOMENT THE REASON WHY WELL I'LL 
TELL YOU IT'S BECAUSE IT'S OUR 
FAVOURITE DAY OF THE YEAR TOMORROW 
NO IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS OR BONFIRE 
NIGHT WE GET TO GO OUT AND 
EXERCISE OUR HARD EARNED DEMOCRATIC 
RIGHTS THOSE POLITICIAN THAT'S WE 
KNOW AND LOVE ARE AS WE SPEAK 
MAKING A LAST MINUTE PITCH FOR YOUR 
VOTES HERE'S LAURA WITH THE LOW 
DOWN ON WHAT'S UP FOR GRABS 
I CAN TELL HOW EXCITED ARE YOU WE 
ARE ON THE EVE OF GORDON BROWN'S 
FIRST ELECTORAL JOUST AS PRIME 
MINISTER POLITICAL WARRIORS ARE 
LIMBERING UP TO DO BATTLE THERE'S 
A LOT AT STAKE THE MAYORAL 
CONTEST IN LONDON AND MORE THAN 
FOUR THOUSAND COUNCIL SEATS ACROSS ENGLAND 
AND WALES POLITICAL WARRIORS ARE 
ALREADY DAMPENING DOWN EXPECTATIONS 
THE CONSERVATIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
CHIEF ERIC PICKLES SAYS THEY'RE 
ONLY AIMING FOR SIXTY TO EIGHTY SEATS F. THEY 
HIT TREBLE FIGURES HE SAYS IT WILL 
BE A CAUSE FOR JUBILATION IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO SEE THROUGH THE SPIN 
REMEMBER NINETEEN NINETY MRS. THATCHER CLAIMED 
THE FLAGSHIP LONDON BOROUGHS OF 
WESTMINSTER AND WANDSWORTH WERE 
UNDER THREAT THAT ALLOWED THE 
CONSERVATIVES TO CLIM A VICTORY 
WHEN SHE HUNG ONTO THEM AND 
CONVENIENTLY DISTRACTED ATTENTION 
THE PARTY WERE ROUTED ELSEWHERE IN 
THE COUNTRY WHAT SHOULD WE LOOK 
FOR THE INDEPENDENT POLLING EXPERT 
PROFESSOR COLIN RALLINGS SAYS DAVID 
CAMERON MUST GAIN OVER FORTY PER CENT IF HE'S 
TO SHOW THAT THE TORIES ARE MAKING 
STRONG ENOUGH PROGRESS AS FOR 
GORDON BROWN RALLINGS SAYS IF 
LABOUR POLLED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE NATIONAL 
VOTE THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER TWENTY SIX PER CENT 
WOULD BE A POOR PERFORMANCE BUT NO 
WORSE THAN TONY BLAIR HAS DONE SO 
IF GORDON BROWN COULD BETTER THAT 
FIGURE GO FOR TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT OR MORE HE 
COULD MANAGE TO CLAIM HE'D DRAWN A 
LINE IN THE SAND FOR THE LIB DEMS 
PROFESSOR COLIN RALLINGS SAYS NICK 
CLEGG HAS AT THE VERY LEAST TO 
MATCH MING CAMPBELL'S PERFORMANCE 
OF TWENTY FOUR PER CENT FROM LAST YEAR LET'S SPEAK 
NOW TO THE POLLING WHIZ JOHN 
CURTICE WHO IS HUNKERED DOWN IN THE 
B. B. C. ELECTION BUNKER FOR LABOUR 
THEN WHAT'S THIS GOING TO BE MID 
TERM BLUES OR A MELT DOWN WELL WELL IT'S AT LEAST GOING TO BE MID TERM 
BLUES LABOUR'S POSITION IN THE 
OPINION POLLS ARE ON AVERAGE NOW 
BACK TO THIRTY PER CENT WHICH IRONICALLY IS 
EXACTLY WHERE IT WAS AT THIS TIME 
LAST YEAR THIS TIME LAST YEAR IT 
MANAGED ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT IN THE PROJECTED 
NATIONAL VOTE IT LOOKS TO ME AS 
THOUGH IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
FOR LABOUR TO DO SIGNIFICANTLY 
BETTER THAN THAT WHAT THEY'RE HOPE 
TO AVOID IS DOING ANY WORSE THAN 
THEY DID IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHICH IS THE YEAR 
AS IT HAPPENS THAT THE SEATS THAT 
ARE BEING CONTESTED THIS YEAR WERE 
LAST PREVIOUSLY CONTESTED WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN THE NUMBER OF 
SEATS THEY TALK ABOUT MORE THAN 
TWO HUNDRED BEING A DISASTER WHAT DO YOU 
THINK 
CERTAINLY IF IT'S OVER TWO HUNDRED THINK IT WOULD BE PRETTY BAD VERY MUCH 
IN THE WAY OF LOSSES AT ALL FOR 
LABOUR IS GOING TO BE PRETTY BAD 
NEWS BECAUSE IN TRUTH GIVEN HOW 
BAD THE POSITION WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THEY 
SHOULDN'T BE LOSING VERY MUCH IN 
SEATS THEY MIGHT LOSE SOME TO THE 
CONSERVATIVES 
HOW MUCH SHOULD WE CONSERVATIVES READ INTO LOCAL ELECTIONS ANY WAY 
SOME SAY ONLY THE MOST COMMITTED 
TURN OUT CAN WE PROJECT THIS ON 
HOW A GENERAL MIGHT LOOK 
THEY GIVE 
US A CLUE IF THE CONSERVATIVES 
MOVE ABOVE THE FORTY PER CENT MARK THAT WILL 
BE A CONFIRMATION OF THE MESSAGE OF 
THE OPINION POLLS THAT THE PARTY IS 
NOW MORE POPULAR THAN TWELVE MONTHS AGO 
IT'S MAKING PROGRESS AT THE SAME 
TIME YOU SHOULD BEAR IN MIND THAT 
PEOPLE VOTE DIFFERENTLY IN LOCAL 
ELECTIONS THAN GENERAL ELECTIONS 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS DO BETTER IN 
LOCAL ELECTIONS LABOUR ALWAYS DO 
WORSE EQUALLY IF LABOUR ARE DOING 
WORSE IN LOCAL ELECTIONS NOW FOR 
EXAMPLE THAN FOUR YEARS AGO THAT 
IS STILL A SIGN THAT THE PARTY IS 
IN DEEPER TROUBLE THAN IT WAS THEN 
WHAT ABOUT THE SMALLER PARTIES 
THEY SOMETIMES MANAGE TO SQUEEZE 
THROUGH IN LOCAL ELECTIONS 
CERTAINLY THAT'S ONE THING TO WATCH 
OUT FOR NATIONAL OPINION POLLS 
SHOW ALL THE SMALLER PARTIES ARE 
MORE POPULAR THAN WE ANTICIPATED 
FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO THE GREENS 
WILL BE LOOKING FOR A SIGNIFICANT 
PERFORMANCE WE NEED TO WATCH THE 
BRITISH NATIONAL PARTY THEY WANT 
TO GET ABOVE THE FIVE PER CENT THRESHOLD IN 
THE LONDON ASSEMBLY ELECTION AND 
GET SOMEBODY INTO THE ASSEMBLY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE DEPUTY 
LEADER OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
VINCE CABLE WELCOME TO THE 
PROGRAMME WE GET ONTO THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS IN A MOMENT FIRST OF ALL 
BARONESS JAY I WANT TO PICK UP ON 
SOME OF THE THINGS HE WAS SAYING 
THERE SERIOUS EXPECTATIONS 
MANAGEMENT GOING ON HERE BIT LABOUR 
PARTY SAYING THAT THEY'RE EXPECTING 
A TWO HUNDRED SEAT LOSS WE HEARD THE 
PROFESSOR SAYING ANY LOSSES WOULD 
BE PRETTY BAD FOR LABOUR TOMORROW 
CLEARLY THIS IS A VERY TOUGH LOCAL 
ELECTION JOHN CURTICE ALSO SAID 
THE LABOUR PARTY TEND TO DO WORSE 
IN LOCAL ELECTIONS THAN IN GENERAL 
ELECTIONS YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER 
THAT THIS LOW FIGURE AGAINST WHICH 
THIS IS BEING MEASURED IS TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
WHICH WAS BAD EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGE 
TODAY WAS BAD 
IRAQ WAR TONY BLAIR 
VERY UNPOPULAR A YEAR LATER LABOUR 
IT IS A TOUGH SITUATION WE ALWAYS 
DO WORSE IN GENERAL ELECTION THAN 
WE DO IN IN LOCAL ELECTIONS THAN 
WE DO IN GENERAL ELECTION L. AM 
HAPPY ABOUT YOUR INTRODUCTION 
SAYING WE ARE ALL EXCITED ABOUT IT 
FOR PEOPLE LIKE LORD STRATHCLYDE 
AND MYSELF IT IS THE ONLY TIME WE 
CAN DEMONSTRATE OUR VOTES 
I ENJOY 
ELECTIONS THEY ARE GREAT FUN IT 
IS GREAT FUN GOING OUT ON TO THE 
STREETS DOING CAMPAIGNING HEARING 
WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING PEOPLE WANT 
A CHANGE THAT IS WHAT THE LABOUR 
PARTY'S PROBLEM IS PEOPLE WANT 
THE CHANGE GORDON BROWN OFFERED 
CHANGE AND HAS NOT DELIVERED ON IT 
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE IT WILL BE TOUGH 
IS THAT BECAUSE OF GORDON BROWN 
SPECIFICALLY 
AS LORD STRATH CLWYD SPECIFICALLY STRATHCLYDE AS JOHN CURTIS SAID 
THIS CAN BE DESCRIBED ADDRESS MID 
TERM BLUES IF YOU YOU HAVE TO 
LOOK HISTORICALLY AT THIS WHICH IS 
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING OLD 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SITUATION IN THE 
NINETEEN NINETIES IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHEN THE LABOUR 
PARTY WENT ON TO WIN A LANDSLIDE IN 
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE POSITION IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS WAS WE WON FORTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE 
VOTE THAT IS A VERY LONG WAY FROM 
WHAT EVEN THE MOST OPTIMISTIC 
TORIES SUGGEST MAY HAPPEN TOMORROW 
THE POINT IS OF COURSE IT IS TOUGH 
OF COURSE IT IS MID TERM THERE 
ARE A LOT OF FACTORS WE HAVE 
SPOKEN ABOUT SOME ALREADY THIS 
MORNING HOUSE PRICES INFLATION 
ET CETERA WHICH WILL MAKE PEOPLE 
FEEL WELL I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL 
VOTE TOMORROW THAT DOES NOT 
NECESSARILY REFLECT ON THE NATIONAL 
POSITION 
LORD STRATHCLYDE ANSWER POSITION THIS CHARGE THAT IF YOU DON'T GET 
FORTY SEVEN PER CENT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY NOT GOT A 
HOPE OF WINING THE NEXT GENERAL 
ELECTION 
I REMEMBER NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WAS THE ELECTION DEPTHS OF WHERE THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY GOT TO INCLUDING THE PRIME 
MINISTER RESIGNING JOHN MAJOR HE 
RESIGNED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE PUT HIMSELF UP 
FOR ELECTION L. DON'T THINK THAT 
GORDON BROWN IS GOING TO BE 
RESIGNING THERE IS ALWAYS A 
PROBLEM DO PEOPLE VOTE FOR LOCAL 
THINGS NAIGAL THINGS AT THE END 
THEY VOTE FOR A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH 
THEY VOTE TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT A 
KICKING I THINK THEY WILL GIVE THE 
GOVERNMENT A KICKING PARTICULARLY 
THIS IS THE LOCAL ELECTIONS WHICH 
LAST TOOK PLACE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THEY WERE 
BAD TIMES FOR LABOUR IF THEY ARE 
BAD FOR LABOUR TOMORROW THAT WILL 
BE WORSE THAN IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
LONDON IS CRUCIAL 
IF I CAN PICK 
YOU UP BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT LONDON 
IS IT ENOUGH THAT IT IS BAD FOR 
GORDON BROWN YOU ALREADY HAVE MORE 
COUNCIL SEATS THAN LABOUR AND THE 
LIB DEMS PUT TOGETHER HOW DO YOU 
MAINTAIN THIS FORWARD MOMENTUM HOW 
DO YOU PAINT A PICTURE OF SUCCESS 
I THINK JOHN CURTIS WAS RIGHT ABOUT 
THE PROPORTION OF THE VOTE FORTY PER CENT 
WOULD BE FANTASTIC 
THAT WOULD MEAN 
YOU ARE PLATEAUING 
IF WE GOT INTO 
THREE FIGURES OVER ONE HUNDRED WE WOULD 
BE PLEASED JOB WELL DONE STEADY 
PROGRESS 
YOU HAND ON HEART THINK PROGRESS FORTY PER CENT WOULD BE GOOD 
THAT WOULD BE A 
GREAT RESULT FOR US 
I SENSE 
EXPECTATIONS MANAGEMENT GOING ON 
HERE I AM AFRAID 
VINCENT CABLE WHAT IS A GOOD 
RESULT FOR THE LIB DEMS TOMORROW 
WE ARE NOT SETTING QUAN TAIIVE 
TARGETS WE HAD FOUR TWO HUNDRED COUNCILLORS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ONE IN FIVE WE 
EXPECT TO BE VERY MUCH IN THAT AREA 
AS MARGARET POINTED OUT THE 
MEANINGFUL COMPARISON IS WHERE WE 
WERE FOUR YEARS AGO THAT WAS THE 
PERIOD WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WERE 
POPULAR WE DID RELATIVELY WAR 
BECAUSE OF THE IRAQ WAR EFFECT AND 
THE CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
THAT IS DIFFICULT POSITION BUT 
WE ARE DEFENDING THAT 
ONE OF YOUR 
DIFFICULTYS IS THE RECOGNITION 
FACTOR WE DID OUR OWN LITTLE STRAW 
POLL YESTERDAY GILES WENT TO 
LIVERPOOL AND FOUND OUT PEOPLE DID 
NOT KNOW WHAT ALEX KENNY WHO 
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WHO DIDN'T KNOW 
WHO NICK CLEGG IS 
IF IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS WHICH 
PREVAILED WHEN HE WAS LEADER THEY 
WERE AVERAGING SEVENTEEN PER CENT IT IS NOW TWENTY PER CENT 
IT HAS MOVED UP SINCE HE TOOK OVER 
HE GETS A LOT OF THE CREDIT FOR 
THIS ONE OH THE INTERESTING THINGS 
ABOUT LOCAL ELECTIONS IS ALTHOUGH 
IT IS PROJECTED VERY OFTEN AS A 
TORY V. LABOUR THING N. THE BIG 
CITIES THE TORIES HAVE DISAPPEARED 
IN NEWCASTLE SHEFFIELD HULL 
LIVERPOOL WE ARE FIGHTING IT OUT 
WITH THE LABOUR PARTY THERE 
DIFFERENT RESULTS IN DIFFERENT 
AREAS THE BIG SEATS IN THE NORTH 
OF COURSE A BIG URBAN BATTLE HERE 
IN LONDON IT IS GOING TO BE A 
FASCINATING CONTEST BORIS VERSES 
KEN WITH ALL RESPECT TO BRIAN 
PADDICK THE CHANCES ARE IT WILL BE 
A PADDICK LIVINGSTONE RACE DO YOU 
THINK HE WOULD BE A GOOD MAYOR 
BORIS 
I THINK HE WOULD BE A GOOD BORIS MAYOR I KNOW HIM WELL P. HE IS LIKE 
A BUTTERFLY FROM A CHRIS LIS HE 
HAS TURNED INTO A MAN WHO WANTS TO 
BE MAYOR HE HAS NOT PUT A FOOT 
WRONG HE HAS BEEN AROUND THE KEY 
AREAS OF LONDON HE HAS BEEN 
FIGHTING IT OUT IN LONDON N. THE 
SUBURBS REMINDING THEM THEY ARE 
PART OF THIS SHOW 
THAT IS THE ONLY 
CHANCE HE HAS OF PICKING UP REAL 
VOTES HE DOES NOT LOOK HAPPY ON 
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL I HAVE TO SAY 
IT IS PART OF HIS SERIOUS LOOK HIS 
SERIOUS FACE 
THIS IS THE SERIOUS 
BORIS 
IT IS REALISING THERE IS A BORIS BIG JOB TO BE DONE IN LONDON IT IS 
VERY LIKELY THAT HE IS GOING TO BE 
THE MAN TO DO 
IT AFTER TOMORROW IS IS IT A BELL WEATHER FOR 
THE REST 
OF THE COUNTRY OR A LITTLE MICROCOSM OF OPINION 
IT IS AN IMPORTANT CITY 
I DON'T THINK IT IS ONE FOR THE 
CITY WE HAVE TWO INDEED THREE 
VERY FORMIDABLE CANDIDATES TWO ARE 
EXTREMELY WELL KNOWN LIKE TOM 
STRATHCLYDE I KNOW BORIS WELL AND 
I FIND HIM ENTERTAINING AS MAYOR 
AND SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
HUGE ISSUES AND BUDGET IN LONDON I 
CAN'T SEE IT HAPPENING THAT IS WHY 
L. CERTAINLY AM PLEASED L. AM 
CERTAINTY HAPPY WITH KEN AS MAYOR 
IMAGINE YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR BRIAN 
PADDICK WHO WOULD YOUR MAN BE 
BORIS OR KEN 
I AM NOT VOLUNTEERING 
A SECOND PREFERENCE L. AM 
CONCENTRATING ON BRIAN PADDICK'S 
CAMPAIGN HE IS BEST OF THE THREE 
IN COMPETENCE 
HE WILL NOT WIN 
WILL HE 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN MARGARET IS RIGHT THIS IS 
NOT A MICROCROSM THE PARTY 
POLITICAL LABOUR HAS BECOME 
PROGRESSIVELY LESS IMPORTANT THAT 
IS WHY WHO EVER WINS IT WILL NOT 
REFLECT POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY ON 
THE PARTY VERY MUCH ON THE 
PERSONALITIES CONCERNED 
IF KEN DID 
NOT WIN IT WOULD NOT GET YOU SAYING 
IT IS LABOUR IN PROBLEMS 
I THINK 
HIS PROBLEMS ARE DEEPER THAN WHAT 
HAPPENS TO KEN LIVINGSTONE IT IS 
NOT A GOOD BENCHMARK 
IF KEN 
LIVINGSTONE LOSES YOU WILL NOT 
BLAME IT ON THE GORDON EFFECT 
WHAT ARE OUR E. MAILERS SAYING 
THIS ONE IS DISAPPOINTED IT IS NOT 
A GENERAL ELECTION TOMORROW IT IS 
ONLY A LOCAL ELECTION IT IS A 
PITY IT IS NOT A GENERAL ELECTION 
IF IT WERE WE COULD REMOVE BROWN 
AND ALISTAIR DARLING FROM POWER 
JOHN FROM ENGLAND SAYS LOWER HOUSE 
PRICES ARE THE ONLY GOOD NEWS AT 
THE MOMENT HE IS PLEASED ABOUT 
THE SLOWDOWN BUT PUT AGAINST HUGE 
RISES IN FUEL HEATING COUNCIL TAX 
THIS PALLS INTO INSIGNIFICANCE 
SOMEONE MORE UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S POSITION IS THIS ONE 
FROM LONDON I THINK PART OF THE 
PROBLEM IS PEOPLE'S UNWILLINGNESS 
TO MAKE SACRIFICES AND SAVE IN 
ORDER TO GET A MORTGAGE UNTIL I 
PAID OFF MY MORTGAGE I SPENT ONE 
THIRD TO HALF OF MY INCOME ON 
HOUSING IT IS UNREALISTIC TO 
EXPECT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAVE AND 
BUY A HOME THIS ONE IS THE 
DOMINANT FLAVOUR OF THE E. MAILS I 
DON'T RECALL GORDON BROWN 
COMPLAINING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT MORTGAGES 
WHEN THE FEEL GOOD FACTOR WAS 
FAVOURING HIS GOVERNMENT WHY 
DIDN'T HE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE BANKS 
THEN KEEP E. MAILS COMING IN NOW 
GORDON WE NOTICE YOU HAVE NOT HAD 
IT EASY OF LATE WHAT WITH ONE 
THING AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND 
ANOTHER ONE NASTY INTERVIEWER 
ACCUSED YOU OF LACKING HUMAN 
CONNECTION WE NOTICE IT IS TAKING 
ITS TOLL YOU ARE LOOKING A LITTLE 
BIT GLUM DON'T DESPAIR BECAUSE 
THE MUG IS HERE JUST LOOK HOW

WILL REMIND YOU HOW TO ENTER IN A 
MINUTE LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN 
REMEMBER WHEN THIS HAPPEN 
WHEN H. HAPPENED 
THE AYES TO THE RIGHT THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN THE 
NOSE TO THE LEFT THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
I LIKE TO MOVE IT 
MOVE IT 
I LIKE TO MOVE IT 
ANY CHANCE OF INTRODUCING THE SAME 
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS YOU HAVE IN 
GERMANY NO CHANCE 
I FEEL IT IN MY FINGERS 
I FEEL IT IN MY TOES 
WE HAVE ALREADY HAD SOME GUESSES 
HERE IN THE STUDIO CAN YOU WORK 
OUT WHEN ALL THAT HAPPENED TO BE 
IN WITH CHANCE OF WINING THE 
DAILY POLITICS MUG SEND YOUR ANSWER 
TO OUR SPECIAL E. MAIL QUIZ YOU CAN 
SEE THE FULL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
ON OUR WEBSITE 
WE CANNOT ACCEPT ANY ENTRIES AFTER 
TWELVE THIRTY P. M. SO BE QUICK ONE OF OUR 
MOST SENIOR POLITICIANS CONFESSED 
TO NOT DELIVERING ON HIS PROMISES 
IT IS TRUE NOTHING TO DO WITH 
GORDON BROWN OR POVERTY OR ANYTHING 
LIKE THAT MR. CAMERON ADMITTED HE 
FAILED TO END THE PUNCH AND JUDY 
POLITICS OF PRIME MINISTER'S 
QUESTION SOMETHING HE PROMISED TO 
DO I SUSPECT SOME OF YOU ARE 
PLEASED ABOUT IT JUDGE FROM E. 
MAILS SOME OF YOU WILL NOT BE SOME 
OF US HERE IN THE STUDIO LIKE THE 
KNOCK ABOUT SO WITH FEW MINUTES 
TO GO BEFORE THE GREAT SHOWDOWN 
LET'S SPEAK TO KEVIN MAGUIRE 
ASSOCIATE EDITOR OF THE DAILY 
MIRROR THIS IS GORDON BROWN'S LAST 
CHANCE TO IMPRESS UPON THE VOTERS 
BEFORE TOMORROW WHAT WOULD YOU 
SUGGEST HE GOES ON 
WELL IF I WAS 
DAVID CAMERON I WOULD OBVIOUSLY 
FOCUS ON LONDON BORIS S. CHANCING 
OF BEATING KEN LIVINGSTONE IT IS 
DIFFICULT FOR DAVID CAMERON 
CONFESSING HE SAID HE WOULD ABANDON 
PUNCH AND JUDY POLITICS THAT IS 
WHAT IT IS ABOUT IF YOU PUT 
REASONABLE POINTS YOU WILL NOT GET 
ANY ANSWERS IT IS ABOUT PUTTING 
THE PRIME MINISTER ON THE ROPES AND 
TRYING TO RAISE THE MORALE OF YOUR 
TROOPS I THINK HE WILL THROW 
THINGS AT THE PRIME MINISTER 
INCLUDING THE FACT HE WEARS A 
CLOTHE AND SAYING HE WAS SORRY 
ABOUT TEN P. TAX 
IS THAT STILL 
RESSONATING 
IT IS STILL ON THE RESSONATING DOORSTEP IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
GET COMPENSATION THEY PROBABLY WILL 
NOT FOR SIX MONTHS 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
BACKBENCHERS WHAT IS THEIR 
FEELING 
MOST LABOUR BACKBENCHERS FEELING ARE NERVOUS L. DON'T THINK THERE'LL 
BE ANY THREAT TO GORDON BROWN'S 
LEADERSHIP THERE IS A SMALL RUMP 
OF BLAIRITE S. PARTICULARLY 
CHAERLS CLARK CHARLES CLARK 
THEY MUST BE LOVING IT THEY MUST 
BE LOVING THIS 
I THINK THERE IS A 
SPLIT THOSE BLAIRITES WHO HAVE GOT 
INTO THE CABINET AND BECOME BROWNYS 
THEY WANT GORDON BROWN TO DO WELL 
THEY WANT TO HANG ON TO THEIR JOBS 
THEN THERE IS THE DISAFFECTED HAS 
BEENS WHO WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE 
THEY ARE THE TROUBLEMAKERS IT IS 
NOT ACROSS THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY 
IN MANY WAYS GORDON BROWN BY 
ADMITTING HE GOT TEN P. ACTUALLY GOT 
CREDIT FROM HIS BACKBENCHERS HE 
SAID I LISTENED TO YOU THE 
PARLIAMENTARY PARTY 
I AM A HAS 
BEEN 
I WOULD NOT SAY THAT AT ALL BEEN I AM A BLAIRITE I THOUGHT I FELT 
YOU WINCH 
UNDER BLAIRITE AND ALL 
THOSE OTHER TERMS SO DESCRIBED L. 
WANT GORDON BROWN TO DO WELL 
BECAUSE I AM ON THE BECAUSE I WANT 
THE LABOUR PARTY TO DO WELL ATRY ATRY BALL POLITICIAN THE TEN P. THING 
STILL RESSONATES IT RESSONATES 
BECAUSE IT IS ON THE DOORSTEP 
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR CHEQUES 
THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY ARE 
SEEING THIS IS A PROBLEM WHICH HAS 
BEEN BUILDING UP FOR OVER TWELVE MONTHS 
I THINK IF I WERE DAVID CAMERON I 
WOULD STILL EXERT PRESSURE 
ON THE TEN P. 
OTHER PROBLEMS OVER THE 
HORIZON THE TERRORISM BILL A LOT 
OF PEOPLE UP WITHOUT TRIAL AND AND GOAD HIM INTO HIS NEXT PROBLEMS 
THE NEXT CHANGE OF MIND DITHER 
THE NEXT INABILITY TO MAKE A 
DECISION OR SPOT THE PROBLEMS AHEAD 
HOW CAN GORDON BROWN USE PRIME 
MINISTER'S QUESTIONS TO MAKE THAT 
CONNECTION TO EMPHASISE THIS 
THING WE ALL ACCUSE HIM OF BEING 
INCAPABLE IT IS A DIFFICULT ARENA 
IT IS NOT THE TIME TO BE WARM AND 
HUMAN AND LOW KEY IT IS VERY MUCH 
IT IS THE PUNCH AND JUDY FORUM AS 
YOU SAID THAT IS HOW IT IS SET UP 
FOR EXAMPLE THE RADIO INTERVIEW WE 
HEARD WITH HIM THIS MORNING IN 
WHICH HE WAS AUTHORITATIVE AND CALM 
AND TALKED ABOUT THE THINGS WHICH 
MATTERED TO HIM AND YET HAD A NOTE 
OF CONVICTION IN HIS VOICE IS THE 
REAL GORDON BROWN THAT IS NOT THE 
ONE WE WILL SEE IN THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE 
MINUTES OR HALF AN HOUR THAT IS 
NOT THAT FORUM WE HEARD THAT 
PERSON THIS MORNING 
LET'S HEAR 
FROM THE MAN HIMSELF 
THE PRIME MINISTER IS WELL AWARE 
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURN DOWN IS 
CAUSING MANY IN OUR COUNTRY CONCERN 
CAN I HAVE AN ASSURANCE FROM HIM 
TODAY THAT HIS TOP PRIORITY WILL BE 
THE BRITISH ECONOMY WITH STABILITY 
AND HIGH EMPLOYMENT AT ITS CORE AND 
CAN I HAVE AN ASSURANCE THAT HE 
WILL NEVER MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT 
THREE MILLION UNEMPLOYED IS A PRICE 
WORTH PAYING 
MR. SPEAKER I WILL 
NEVER MAKE THAT STATEMENT IT IS 
BECAUSE OF OUR POLICIES THAT THERE 
ARE THREE MILLION MORE PEOPLE IN 
WORK THAN EVER BEFORE AND IT'S 
BECAUSE OF OUR POLICIES WE HAVE 
HIGHER VACANCIES AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
AT THE LOWEST FOR THIRTY YEARS N. HIS 
CONSTITUENCY OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT 
IS DOWN FORTY TWO PER CENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN MR. SPEAKER 
THE CHOICE IN FUTURE WILL BE 
BETWEEN A CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT 
CAUSED THREE MILLION UNEMPLOYED AND 
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO OF THE 
WORST RECESSIONS IN HISTORY AND A 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT THAT IS ON THE 
SIDE OF HOMEOWNERS FACING 
DIFFICULTIES THOSE FACING HIGH 
FUEL PRICES A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
THAT HAS NEVER REACHED THE FIGURE 
OF REPOSSESSIONS UNDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES AND WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO FIGHT FOR EVERY JOB IN THIS 
COUNTRY COUNTRY THE PLANTED QUESTIONLES GET TOUGHER 
AND TOUGHER AS THE PRIME MINISTER 
KNOWS THERE'S ONLY ONE THING MORE 
UNCOMFORTABLE THAN U. TURN AND 
THATCY U. TURN AFTER REPEATED 
PROTESTATION THAT'S YOU'RE NOT 
GOING TO MAKE ONE CAN I OFFER THE 
PRIME MINISTER AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY 
TO RETRACT WHAT HE SAID LAST WEEK 
AND ADMIT THAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE 
TO MAKE MAJOR CONCESSIONS ON HIS 
PROPOSALS TO EXTEND DETENTION 
WITHOUT CHARGE TO FORTY TWO DAYS 
WE ARE 
GOING AHEAD WITH OUR PROPOSAL AND 
WE WILL PUT IT TO THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS I DO SAY TO THE OPPOSITION 
PARTIES THEY AGREE WITH US IN 
PRINCIPLE THAT THERE WILL BE CASES 
OF TERRORISM WHERE WE NEED MORE 
THAN TWENTY EIGHT DAYS TO INTERVIEW WITNESSS 
THEY AGREE WITH US THAT THERE ARE 
CERTAIN EMERGENCY CONDITIONS WHERE 
THAT WILL BE REQUIRED AND SO TOO 
DOES THE LIBERAL PARTY THE 
QUESTION THEREFORE IS WHETHER WE 
HAVE PUT IN PLACE THE CIVIL 
LIBERTIES PROTECTION THAT'S ARE 
NECESSARY AND THAT WE HAVE DONE AND 
THAT IS WHY WE'LL GO AHEAD WITH 
PUTTING THIS PROPOSAL TO THE HOUSE 
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY SHOULD BE 
SUPPORTING IT 
WHAT WE OBJECT TO IS 
NEW LEGISLATION THAT THREATENS 
CIVIL LIBERTIES THAT ISN'T 
NECESSARY THAT COULD ACTUALLY MAKE 
THE SITUATION WORSE WILL HE LISTEN 
TO HIS OWN DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC 
PROSECUTIONS WHO SAYS THIS WE 
DON'T PERCEIVE ANY NEED FOR THE 
PERIOD OF TWENTY EIGHT DAYS TO BE INCREASED 
OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT WE 
HAVE MANAGED COMFORTIBLY WITHIN TWENTY EIGHT 
DAYS THIS IS THE MAN RESPONSIBLE 
FOR INTERVIEWING TERRORISTS WILL WILL HE ALSO LISTEN TO THE INDEPENDENT 
REVIEWER LORD CARLILE WHO GAVE 
EVIDENCE A FEW DAYS AGO ABOUT THE 
NEED FOR THE EXTRA POWER AND WILL 
HE NOT RECOGNISE THAT IF WE HAVE TO 
COME TO THE HOUSE IN A PERIOD OF 
EMERGENCY AND ASK FOR THESE EXTRA 
POWERS THAT IS NOT THE WAY BECAUSE 
THAT GIVES OXYGEN TO TERRORISM IT 
IS BETTER TO TAKE THE PRE EMPTIVE 
ACTION NOW AND I THINK THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY SHOULD BE 
ASHAMED OF ITSELF NOT SUPPORTING 
THIS LEGISLATION 
IT'S NOT JUST THE 
DIRECTOR OF PUBLISH PROSECUTION 
WHO'S OPPOSES IT THE FORMER 
ATTORNEY GENERAL THE FORMER LORD 
CHANCELLOR THE FORMER INSPECTOR OF 
THE CONSTABULARY SAYS IT'S WRONG 
NOW WE KNOW WHAT LABOUR M. P.'S 
THEMSELVES THINK WE'VE BEEN SENT A 
REPORT FROM THE LABOUR WHIP'S 
OFFICE ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK ONLY 
THIS GOVERNMENT COULD MANAGE TO 
SEND IT ACROSS IT BRINGS A MEANING 
TO THE PHRASE USUAL CHANNELS ONE 
MINISTER SAYS THE FORTY TWO DAY LIMIT HAS 
BEEN PLUCKED FROM THIN AIR ANOTHER 
M. P. SAYS I COULD BE PERSUADED TO 
STAY AWAY THAT'S STRAIGHT FROM THE 
PRIME MINISTER'S BOK OF KURNING 
BOOK OF COURAGE 
AND MY FAVOURITE FROM THE 
THE SUBSTANTIAL ISSUE IS WHETHER 
FACING A MAJOR TERRORIST INCIDENT 
MINISTERS MAY HAVE TO COME BEFORE 
THE HOUSE AND ASK FOR THAT EXTRA 
POWER WHEN WE COULD TAKE IT IN A 
PRECAUTIONARY WAY L. BELIEVE THAT 
WE HAVE DEALT WITH THE CIVIL 
LIBERTIES ARGUMENTS IN THIS ISSUE 
WE HAVE GIVEN THE HOME SECRETARY 
THE REQUIREMENT THAT SHE MUST COME 
TO THE HOUSE IF THERE IS ANY ORDER 
IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE WE HAVE 
GIVEN NEW POWERS TO THE INDEPENDENT 
REVIEWER SO THAT HE CAN ADJUDICATE 
THE CASE WE HAVE GIVEN NEW POWERS 
TO THE JUDICIARY SO THAT EVERY 
SEVEN DAYS THE PERSON HAS TO COME 
BEFORE THE JUDICIARY BEFORE THE 
DETENTION IS CONFIRMED L. BELIEVE 
THAT WE ARE PROTECTING THE CIVIL 
LIBERTIES OF 
THE COUNTRY L. BELIEVE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ARE MAKING A 
MISTAKE IF THEY BELIEVE WE SHOULD 
NOT TAKE THIS PRECAUTIONARY 
LEGISLATION IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE 
SOPHISTICATED INVESTIGATION THAT'S 
GO RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD 
INVOLVING MOBILE PHONES E. MAILS 
COMPUTERS MEAN THAT THE AMOUNT OF 
WORK AND TIME NEEDED BY THE POLICE 
TO INVESTIGATE CASES ARE A GREAT 
DEAL HIGHER L. BELIEVE THE 
CONSERVATIVES WOULD MAKE A MISTAKE 
TO OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION THE THE PRIME MINISTER IS WRONG WE HAVE 
ADDRESSED THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES 
WE SAID USE INTERCEPT EVIDENCE IN 
TERROR TRIALS HE'S BEGIN TO TAKE 
UP THE PROPOSAL WE SAID QUESTION 
SUSPECTS AFTER CHARGE THAT'S IN 
THE TERRORISM BILL WE SAID LET'S 
HAVE A PROPER BORDER POLICE FORCE 
HE'S GOT THE BORDER BIT HE DOESN'T 
SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THE POLICE BIT 
THE FACT IS HE HASN'T CONVINCED 
ANYBODY THE FORMER ATTORNEY 
GENERAL SAYS THIS NOT ONLY IS IT 
WRONG IN PRINCIPLE BUT ALSO 
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE IT CAN 
LEAD TO THE RISK THAT PART OF OUR 
COMMUNITY SEES THIS AS AN ATTACK ON 
THEM HOW FAR IS HE PREPARED TO 
TAKE THIS BATTLE WITH HIS PARTY 
WILL THIS VOTE BE AN ISSUE OF KDS 
FOR HIS GOVERNMENT 
WE WILL PUT OUR 
PROPOSAL BEFORE THE HOUSE IT WILL 
BE ONE THAT I BELIEVE CONSERVATIVE 
MEMBERS AND LIBERAL MEMBERS SHOULD 
THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT AS WELL IF 
HE HAS TO EXAMINE AS I HAD TO 
EXAMINE AS CHANCELLOR THE CASES 
FOR TERRORIST ASSET FREEZES AND IF 
HE IS TO EXAMINE THE CASE THAT'S 
COME BEFORE THE POLICE THEN HE 
KNOWS THAT THE SOPHISTICATION OF 
INVESTIGATIONS NOW REQUIRED LOOKING 
INTERNATIONALLY AT A RANGE OF 
ISSUES INCLUDING COMPUTER 
DOCUMENTS AND E. MAILS MEANS THAT 
THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN IT IS 
DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO DID A 
SOPHISTICATED INVESTIGATION IN TWENTY EIGHT 
DAYS AND IF I MAY SAY SO WE 
SHOULD AS A HOUSE TAKE THE 
PRECAUTIONARY POSITION THAT WE HAVE 
THIS POWER IT CANNOT BE TRIGGERED 
WOIT THE HOME SECRETARY COMING BACK 
TO THE HOUSE TO ASK FOR THE EXTRA 
POWERS THAT MEAN THAT'S WE ARE 
VOTE ANYTHING PRINCIPLE FOR A FORTY TWO 
DAYS LIMIT BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
THE HOME SECRETARY MUST COME BEFORE 
THE HOUSE L. BELIEVE THE ISSUE 
BEFORE THE HOUSE WAS WHETHER THERE 
WAS ARBITRARY DETENTION OF PEOPLE 
WE HAVE TAKEN ALL THE PRECAUTIONS 
NECESSARY AGAINST ARBITRARY 
DETENTION WE SHOULD GO AHEAD WITH 
THIS MEASURE AND THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY SHOULD BE SUPPORTING IT 
THE PRIME MINISTER TALKS ABOUT THE 
SOPHISTICATION OF THE PROSECUTIONS 
WHO DO YOU THINK KNOWS MORE ABOUT 
THAT THE PRIME MINISTER OR THE 
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 
HE'S THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR TRYING 
TO CONVICT AND IMPRISON THESE 
PEOPLE HE DIDN'T ANSWER MY 
QUESTION SO LET ME ASK HIM AGAIN 
HE TELLS US HOW MUCH THIS MATTERS 
HE TELLS US HE WON'T MAKE MORE 
CONCESSIONS IS IT AN ISSUE OF 
CONFIDENCE 
MR. SPEAKER WE WILL PUT CONFIDENCE THIS BEFORE THE HOUSE IF I MAY SAY 
SO THE HEAD OF THE METROPOLITAN 
POLICE HAS ALSO SOME IDEA WHAT 
SOPHISTICATED INVESTIGATIONS 
INVOLVE THE INDEPENDENT REVIEWER 
HAS BEEN EXAMINING ALL THE CASES 
AND HE IS CONVINCED OF THE NEED TO 
GO BEYOND TWENTY EIGHT K. A I. Z. THE HOME OFFICE 
SELECT COMMITTEE SAID THERE MAY BE 
A CASE FOR GOING BEYOND TWENTY EIGHT DAYS AT 
THE SAME TIME THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY LIBERTY AND THE LIBERAL 
PARTY HAVE AGREED THERE MAY BE A 
CASE AND THEY WANT TO TRIGGER THE 
CIVIL CONTINGENCIES ACT IF THERE 
IS A CASE THAT SOME INSTANCES WILL 
INVOLVE GOING BEYOND TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THEN 
SURELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS FOR 
A GOVERNMENT TO RESPECT THE CIVIL 
LIBERTIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL BY 
AVOIDING ARBITRARY TREATMENT BUT 
TO TAKE THE POWER THAT COULD ONLY 
BE TRIGGERED AGAIN BIT HOME 
SECRETARY COMING BEFORE THE HOUSE 
THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY AND THE 
RESPONSIBLE WAY WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT THE SECURITY OF EVERY CITIZEN 
IN THIS COUNTRY 
MR. SPEAKER HE 
WON'T ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT A 
VOTE OF CONFIDENCE SOY THINK 
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER 
REBELLION ANOTHER BACK DOWN 
ANOTHER U. TURN AND COLLAPSE OF 
PARTY ISN'T THE TRUTH OF THE FORTY TWO 
DAYS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FIASCO 
OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE THE REASON 
HE'S PUSHING THIS IS NOT BECAUSE 
IT'S RIGHT BUT BECAUSE IT'S PART OF 
A POLITICAL CALCULATION WITH TEN P. 
IT WAS ABOUT TRYING TO POSE AS A 
TAX CUTTER THIS TIME IT'S ABOUT 
TRYING TO POSE AS BEING TOUGH ON 
TERROR EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT'S 
HAPPENING TODAY APPARENTLY HE'S 
ADMITTING MISTAKES WHY DOESN'T HE 
ADMIT THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF ALL 
HE PUTS POLITICAL CALCULATION AND 
SELF INTEREST 
LABOUR M. P.'S ARE SELF INTEREST SHOUTING AND POINTING AT MR. CAMERON 
ONE OR TWO MINISTERS EVEN 
APPLAUDING ORDER HE'S HE'S PUTTING POLITICAL CALCULATION AND 
SELF INTEREST AHEAD OF THE RIGHT 
DECISIONS ON THE NATIONAL INTEREST 
MR. SPEAKER ONCE AGAIN HE NEVER 
ADDRESSES THE SUBSTANCE OF THE 
QUESTION THIS IS THE MAN WHO WANTS 
TO BE BOTH TOUGH ON CRIME AND HUG 
HOODY AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS THE 
MAN WHERE POLITICAL CALCULATION 
MEANT HE CYCLED TO WORK BUT AT THE 
SAME TIME HE HAD THE CHAUFFER 
DRIVEN CAR BEHIND THIS IS THE MAN 
WHO IS SHALLOW SALESMAN AND NEVER 
ADDRESSES THE SUBSTANCE OF THE 
ISSUE AND THE IMPORTANT SUBSTANCE 
OF THIS ISSUE IS HOW DO WE PROTECT 
THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AGAINST 
TERRORISM THAT IS MORE THAN 
TRADING A FEW QUOTES IN THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS IT IS LOOKING AT THE 
EVIDENCE BEFORE US AND THE EVIDENCE 
BEFORE US IS WE WILL NEED FORTY TWO DAYS 
I URGE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO 
THINK AGAIN MORE 
ORDER MORE STEPHEN POUND 
MAY I POUND 
POIFRPBT OUT THAT THE GREAT AND 
NOBLE BOROUGH OF EALING IS 
REPRESENTED BY THREE LABOUR MEMBERS 
OF PARLIAMENT NONE OF WHOM MADE 
THE STATEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO US 
HOWEVER MAY I SAY THAT THE LEADER 
OF THE OPPOSITION IS DOING A SIMPLY 
MARVELLOUS JOB 
CONSERVATIVE M. P.'S 
ARE WAVING THEIR ORDER PAPERS 
CHEERING 
OF AUDITIONING FOR THE CHEERING SADLY VACANT CHAIR OF I'M SORRY I 
HAVEN'T A CLUE COULD I ASK THE 
PRIME MINISTER IF HE WOULD NOT 
AGREE WITH ME THAT IT WOULD BE THE 
HEIGHT OF IRRESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY 
CANDIDATE STANDING FOR THE MAYORAL 
TI OF LONDON TO TALK ABOUT SLASHING 
ORDER ORDER L. WON'T 
INVITE THE PRIME MINISTER TO ANSWER 
THAT ONE MR. CLEGG 
IF YOU'RE A LOW 
EARNER IN BRITAIN TODAY 
ORDER REMEMBER WHAT I'VE SAID TO 
THE HOUSE IT'S UNFAIR TO THE RIGHT 
HONOURABLE MEMBER HE SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO PUT HIS TWO QUESTIONS IF 
YOU'RE A LOW EARNER IN BRITAIN 
TODAY IT'S OBVIOUS WHY YOU WOULDN'T 
SUPPORT THE CONSERVATIVES TOMORROW 
BUT AFTER DOUBLING THE TAX RATE FOR 
THE POOR AFTER LEAVING OVER FORTY FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE IN FUEL POVERTY 
AFTER CLOSING THOUSANDS OF POST 
OFFICES CAN HE EXPLAIN WHY ANY LOW 
EARNER SHOULD NOW SUPPORT HIS 
GOVERNMENT 
WE HAVE TAKEN A MILLION GOVERNMENT PENSIONERS OUT OF POVERTY BECAUSE 
WE ARE ON THE ROAD TO TAKING A 
MILLION CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY 
BECAUSE WE INTRODUCED THE NEW DEAL 
TO GET PEOPLE IN WORK OPPOSED BIT 
LIBERAL PARTY WE'VE INTRODUCED 
CHILD TAX CREDITS AND RAISED CHILD 
BENEFIT CHILD TAX CREDITS WERE 
OPPOSED BIT LIBERAL HE 
NOT ASHAMED AT THE GROTESQUE CHAOS 
TO QUOTE NEIL KINNOCK OF A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT SCUTTLING AROUND THE 
COUNTRY HANDING OUT CLOSURE NOTICES 
TO OVER ZERO LOCAL POST OFFICES 
MR. SPEAKER THIS MORNING HE SAID HE 
WANTS TO BE A LISTENING PRIME 
MINISTER LET HIM PROVE IT WILL HE 
NOW STOP ALL FURTHER POST OFFICE 
CLOSURES RIGHT NOW 
MR. SPEAKER 
FOUR MILLION LESS PEOPLE ARE USING 
THE POST OFFICES THAN A FEW YEARS 
AGO WE HAVE PUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION INTO 
HELPING THE POST OFFICE NETWORK 
ONCE AGAIN THE LIBERAL PARTY ARE 
PROPOSING TO SPEND HUGE SUMS OF 
EXTRA MONEY WITHOUT ANY 
RECOGNISABLE MEANS OF PAYING FOR 
THEM THAT'S WHY HIS SHADOW HOME 
SECRETARY CALLED HIM CLAMITY CLEGG 
MY YOUTH OFFENDING TEAM ARE ALL 
WORKING HARD TO PLACE FUNDS FOR 
YOUNGSTERS THOSE WITH MENTAL 
HEALTH PROBLEMS DRUG AND ALCOHOL 
PROBLEMS AND LOW EDUCATIONAL 
ACHIEVEMENT IN WORK CAN I TAKE 
THEM AN ASSURANCE THAT DESPITE THE 
TURNDOWN IN THE ECONOMY WORK WILL 
STILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE 
VULNERABLE YOUNGSTERS SO THAT THEY 
HAVE FUTURE THAT THERE IS 
POTENTIAL FOR THE FUTURE AHEAD FOR 
THEM 
I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF THEM MEETING YOUNG PEOPLE FROM HER 
CONSTITUENCY TO TALK ABOUT THE 
CHALLENGES THEY FACE IN MAINTAINING 
AND GETTING JOBS AND IN YOUTH 
FACILITIES IN THE AREA IN WALES 
EMPLOYMENT IS UP ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
WE HAVE HELPED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN 
THE NEW DEAL WE CREATE JOBS FOR 
YOUNG PEOPLE IN WALES THAT WOULD 
NOT HAPPEN IF WE TOOK THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND THEY WOULD 
CREATE UNEMPLOYMENT 
THE PUBLICS 
ACCOUNT COMMITTEE HAS BRANDED THE 
OIMOIM BUDGETING PROCESS AS 
INCOMPETENT LONDONERS ARE PICKING 
UP THE BILLS IT IS MAYOR THE 
GOVERNMENT OR BOTH 
WE SHOULD BE 
PROUD THE OLYMPICS IS COMING TO 
LONDON IT GIVES ME A CHANCE TO 
CONGRATULATE THE MAYOR OF LONDON 
AS FOR THE OLYMPICS HE WILL KNOW 
THAT IT IS A NATIONAL CONTRIBUTION 
WHICH IS BEING MADE ALSO FROM THE 
EXCHEQUER I BELIEVE HOLDING THE 
OLYMPICS IN LONDON WILL BE A GREAT 
BOOST NOT JUST TO LONDON BUT TO 
THE WHOLE BRITISH ECONOMY 
AFTER YEARS OF DISCUSSION 
PARLIAMENT DECIDED THAT FOX HUNTING 
SHOULD BE BANNED ISN'T THE 
PRIORITY NOW TO ENSURE THAT THE 
LEGISLATION IS IMPLEMENTED 
EFFECTIVELY RATHER THAN PROMISING 
THAT SOME DATE IN THE FUTURE IT 
WILL BE REPELLED 
MR. SPEAKER I 
UNDERSTAND THE LEAD ORE THE 
OPPOSITION SAID WE WOULD LET THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS HAVE A FREE VOTE F. 
THERE WAS A VOTE TO GET RID OF THE 
BAN THERE WOULD BE A GOVERNMENT 
BILL IN GOVERNMENT TIME L. BELIEVE 
THERE IS A SETTLED VIEW OF THE 
PUBLIC ON THIS MATTER L. BELIEVE IT 
WOULD BE BETTER IF ALL PARTIES IN 
THE HOUSE RECOGNISED THE PREVIOUS 
VOTE OF 
THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS ON 
THIS ISSUE 
ON THE POLITICS SHOW WEST ON SUNDAY 
THE HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR STROUD 
WHO I NOTE IS NEXT ON THE ORDER 
PAPER SAID OF THE PRIME MINISTER 
HE WAS NEVER MY CHOICE I MADE IT 
QUITE CLEAR WE SHOULD HAVE LOOKED 
AND MISSED GENERATION GORDON IS 
A TRAGEDY 
ON FRIDAY AFTER THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER IS CARRYING 
OUT AN EMERGENCY RESHUFFLE SHOULD 
THE HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR STROUD BE 
WAITING BY HIS TELEPHONE THIS THIS GOVERNMENT IN THE PAST ELEVEN YEARS HAS 
CREATED MORE JOB FORCE THE PEOPLE 
OF THIS COUNTRY THAN ANY OTHER WE 
HAVE CUT POVERTY WE HAVE DOUBLED 
INVESTMENT IN THE HEALTH SERVICE 
WE HAVE IMPROVED IN INVESTMENT IN 
EDUCATION HE SHOULD BE CONGRAT 
LATING US NOT CRITICISING U. T. S. 
CONGRATULATING US NOT CRITICISING 
US US CHEERS FROM THE CONSERVATIVES CAN CAN I THANK MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND 
FOR THE INITIATIVE THAT HE HAS 
TAKEN ON DARFUR TO CALL A 
CONFERENCE IN LONDON NOW I BELIEVE 
THAT YESTERDAY MY RIGHT HONOURABLE 
FRIEND MET WITH THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER FOR SUDAN AND ALSO THE 
SPECIAL ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT OF 
SUDAN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
MEET THOSE GENTLEMEN ON MONDAY 
COULD MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND 
TELL ME WHAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE 
ON THE CONFERENCE IN PARTICULAR 
WHAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOW BEING 
PERSUED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REBEL 
GROUPS ARE WILLING TO COME TO SUCH 
A CONFERENCE AND MORE PARTICULARLY 
INCLUDING THE ARAB MILITIAS OUR OUR AIM IS NOT JUST TO GET THE REBEL 
PARTIES TOGETHER BUT THE GOVERNMENT 
OF SUDAN TOGETHER AS PART OF THIS 
PROCESS I PRESSED THE SUDANESE 
FOREIGN MINISTER WHEN I SPOKE TO 
HIM YESTERDAY ABOUT THE NEED FOR 
TALKS TO START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
I BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE IF TALKS 
STARTED WE COULD GET TO A CEASEFIRE 
AND AT THE SAME TIME GET TO THE 
PROCESS OF GETTING A POLITICAL 
SETTLEMENT SO THE KEY THING IS TO 
GET THESE TALKS STARTED THAT IS 
WHY APPROACHS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE 
REBEL GROUPS THAT IS WHY THE UN 
GENERAL SECRETARY IS INVOLVED WHY 
WE HAVE OFFERED LONDON AS A 
POSSIBLE CENTRE FOR TALKS THAT IS 
WHY I AM HOPEFUL IF WE CAN MOVE 
THESE FORWARD THAT THERE IS A 
CHANCE OF TALKS 
MR. SPEAKER WILL THE PRIME MINISTER 
GIVE AN UNDERTAKING TO THIS HOUSE 
THAT BY THE REPORT STAGE OF THE 
FINANCE BILL WE WILL SEE DETAILED 
AND CONCRETE PROPOSALS ON HOW HIS 
GOVERNMENT PLANS TO COMPENSATE THE 
FIVE POINT THREE MILLION LOW EARNERS WHO LOST 
OUT WHEN HE DOUBLED THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE 
HE HAS SENT A LETTER TO THE RATE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN 
AND MADE IT CLEAR WHAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS READY TO DO AND THE 
ACTION THAT WE ARE TAKING TO HELP 
THE SIXTY TO SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLDS AND HELP PEOPLE 
WHO ARE LOW PAID THAT IS WHAT 
QUESTION WILL DO 
THANK YOU 
THEY ARE DOING FANTASTIC JOB THEY ADMINISTER HALF THE SCHOOLS 
HOSPICE AND CARE HOMES THEY HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED IN WONDERFUL 
CAMPAIGNS SUCH AS DROP THE DEBT 
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE H. F. E. A. 
BILL AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE 
PRIME MINISTER HAS GIVEN PEOPLE 
LIKE ME AND PEOPLE OF RELIGIOUS 
CONVICTION FREE VOTE IN THE 
COMMITTEE STAGES OF THIS BILL ON 
THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE WHAT WOULD 
MY HONOURABLE FRIEND NOW CONSIDER 
WHETHER OR NOT IT IS TO ALLOW ME 
FREE VOTE WHEN THIS VOTE COMES 
BEFORE THE HOUSE 
MR. SPEAKER I MADE 
IT CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE A FREE 
VOTE ON OUR SIDE ON PROVISIONS 
RELATING TO SIBABLINGS AND MIXED 
EMBRYOS AND THE NEED FOR FATHER OR 
SUPPORTED PARENTING THESE ARE THE 
FIRST TIME THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN 
DEBATED ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS AND I BELIEVE THAT THE 
LETTER I SENT TO M. P.'S SET OUT THE 
REASONS WHY WE SHOULD DO THIS L. 
THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY OF 
PROCEEDINGS ON AN IMPORTANT BILL 
WE DO NOT WANT TO LOSE BENEFITS OF 
RESEARCH WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO HELP 
PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME WE WISH TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE THERE ARE ETHICAL 
ISSUES BEFORE THE HOUSE WHICH 
SHOULD BE DEBATED ON A FREE VOTE OF 
THE HOUSE 
THANK YOU DOES THE PRIME MINISTER 
RECALL WHEN HE WAS CHANCELLOR 
APPOINTING SIR DAVID BARNEY TO 
CARRY OUT REVIEW OF THE NORTHERN 
IRELAND ECONOMY SIR DAVID'S SECOND 
REPORT IS DUE OUT LATER TODAY 
COULD HE ENSURE THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THAT 
REPORT IS ISSUED BEFORE THE 
NORTHERN IRELAND UNITED STATES 
INVESTMENT CONFERENCE COULD HE SEE 
PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE 
TO THAT REPORT DEALS WITH THE 
COMMITMENT MADE BY HIS DEPRESES 
SORE FIVE YEARS AGO IN THE JOINT 
DECLARATION THAT THEY WOULD HAND 
OVER TO THE NORTHERN IRELAND 
EXECUTIVE MANY OF THE POLICE STATES 
WHICH ARE REDUNDANT TO HELPING THE 
ASSETS WHICH THE EXECUTIVE WOULD 
HAVE 
LET ME CONGRATULATE THE HAVE HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR BECOMING 
LEADER OF HIS PARTY L. WISH HIM 
WELL IN THE TASK AHEAD AS WE MOVE 
FORWARD WITH THE DEVOLUTION 
PROPOSALS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AT 
THE SAME TIME HE IS RIGHT WE HAVE 
TALKED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS 
ABOUT THE REPORT ABOUT WHAT IT CAN 
DO TO BRING NEW INVESTMENT TO 
NORTHERN IRELAND THE INVESTMENT 
CONFERENCE WHICH WILL INCLUDE 
REPUTATION FROM AMERICA WILL TAKE 
PLACE NEXT WEEK L. LOOK FORWARD TO 
MEETING HIM AND THE AMERICAN 
DELEGATION THERE THE REPORT WHICH 
IS PUBLISHED TODAY WILL PUT FORWARD 
PROPOSALS ABOUT HOW WE CAN INCREASE 
THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF NORTHERN 
IRELAND FOR INWARD INVESTMENT SOME 
OF THAT IS IN THE INCENTIVES FOR 
INNOVATION WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE 
FOR COMPANIES COMING INTO NORTHERN 
IRELAND OR DEVELOPING THERE SOME 
IS IN THE'RE OF SKILLS WHERE WE 
OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE AND 
BUILD ON THE GOOD EDUCATION WHICH 
HAPPENS IN NORTHERN IRELAND L. LOOK 
FORWARD TO TALKING TO HIM ABOUT 
THAT AND THE MILITARY BASIS WHEN WE 
MEET SOON 
WOULD MY HONOURABLE 
FRIEND CONGRATULATE THE TEAM WHO 
WON THE STAFF REWARDS AT A HOSPITAL 
LAST EVENING FOR THEIR SUCCESS AND 
FOR THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF 
MRSA CASES THEY HAVE ACHIEVED A SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT 
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WOULD HE 
AGREE THAT COLLEAGUES WHO NOMINATED 
THEM AND PATIENTS WOULD REGARD 
THIS INITIATIVE AND OTHERS OF MY 
RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND'S 
INITIATIVES AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN 
A GIMMICK 
MR. SPEAKER THE DEEP CLEAN OF OUR 
HOSPITALS AND THE DOUBLELING OF THE 
NUMBER OF MATRONS TO MAKE SURE ALL 
HOSPITAL WARDS ARE CLEAN IS VERY 
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF MAKING THE 
HEALTH SERVICE BETTER IN THE FUTURE 
I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN HIM IN 
CONGRATULATING THOSE IN HIS 
CONSTITUENCY AND THE HOSPITAL WHO 
HAVE DONE SO MUCH GOOD WORK TO MAKE 
A HOSPITAL BETTER PLACE IT IS 
TRUE THAT G. P. ACCESS IS IMPORTANT TO 
EVERY CITIZEN IN THIS COUNTRY THAT 
IS WHY IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE 
CONSERVATIVE SPOKESMAN SHOULD HAVE 
SAID HE IS AGAINST THE G. P. ACCESS 
ADVANTAGES THE PROGRESS WHICH HAS 
BEEN MADE AND SAID HE WOULD HAND 
BACK TO G. P.'S THE POWER TO DECIDE 
WHETHER THERE WAS ACCESS FOR THE 
PATIENT I THINK THAT WOULD BE 
RETRO GRADE STAND 
THE PRIME MINISTER CLAIMS HE HAD NO 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE DODGEY LOANS USED 
TO FUND THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
WHICH HE RAN LORD LEVY HAS 
REVEALED THE PRIME MINISTER KNEW 
EVERYTHING IS LORD LEVY LYING I I KNEW NOTHING OF THESE LOANS 
THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE AWARE 
THAT EUROPEAN WORKERS RECEIVE TWICE 
AS MANY BANK HOLIDAYS AS BRITISH 
WORKERS IS HE GOING TO GIVE U. K. 
WORKERS ONE EXTRA BANK HOLIDAY WE WE ARE CONSULTING ON THE NATURE OF 
CITIZENS AND ONE PART OF THE 
CONSULTATION IS ABOUT POTENTIAL 
BANK HOLIDAYS AS A RESULT OF THE 
CHANGES WE HAVE MADE IT IS NOW THE 
LEGAL ENTITLEMENT OF EVERY WORKER 
FROM APRIL FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINE THAT STATUTORY 
PAID LEAVE IS RAISED FROM TWENTY FOUR DAYS 
TO TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE DAYS THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE 
ACTIONS OF A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
TO TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THAT IS BECAUSE OF 
THE ACTIONS OF A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
IS THE PRIME MINISTER AWARE THAT 
NEXT WEEK MARKS THE SIXTH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE POTTERS BAR RAIL 
CRASH STILL NO PUBLIC INQUIRY OR 
INQUEST HAS BEEN HELD ISN'T THIS 
VERY REGRETTABLE 
WELL WE ARE 
DETERMINED TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF 
PASSENGERS ON THE RAIL AND I WILL 
LOOK INTO WHAT HE SAID L. BELIEVE 
WE ARE TAKING ALL THE PRECAUTIONS 
NECESSARY TO ENSURE OUR RAILWAYS 
ARE SAFE 
WALES IS A MUCH MORE PROSPEROUS 
COUNTRY THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO 
THANKS TO THE POLICIES OF THIS 
GOVERNMENT DOES MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND SHARE MY DESPAIR 
THAT THE WELSH WILL BE BETRAYED BY 
THE NATIONALIST HOS WILL DO DEAL 
TO PUT TORIES INTO GOVERNMENT LIKE 
THEY PUT THATCHER INTO GOVERNMENT 
AND A VOTE FOR THE NATIONALISTS 
TOMORROW IS A VOTE FOR THE TORIES 
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE IN WORK IN 
WALES BECAUSE OF A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT T. ONLY WAY TO SAFEGUARD 
JOBS IN WALES IS BY SUPPORTING THE 
LABOUR PARTY 
FURTHER TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S REPLY TO THE MEMBER FOR 
CROSBY CONCERNING THE H. F. E. A. BILL 
WILL THE PRIME MINISTER CONFIRM 
WHETHER THERE'LL BE A THIRD VOTE ON 
THE THIRD READING 
THAT IS NOT THE 
INTENTION IF I MAY SAY SO IF I 
MAY SAY SO IN THE PREVIOUS 
LEGISLATION UNDER THE GOVERNMENT 
THE THIRD READING WAS A WHIP VOTE 
THANK YOU MR. SPEAKER MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIENDS WILL BE AWARE 
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARSVY BEEN TRYING 
TO GET MY BILL THROUGH PARLIAMENT 
UNFORTUNATELY ON FRIDAY ONCE AGAIN 
THE CONSERVATIVES OBJECTED TO MY 
BILL WILL HE USE HIS HIGH OFFICE 
TO TALK TO D. W. P. AND TRY AND GET THIS 
BILL THROUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT 
PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED DURING 
EMPLOYMENT WILL RECEIVE EMPLOYMENT 
AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE REST OF THIS 
NATION NATION MR. SPEAKER LET ME CONGRATULATE HIM 
ON BRINGING FORWARD A BILL FOR THE 
EMPLOYMENT OF THE DISABLED LET ME 
CONGRATULATE HIM IN KEEPING ALIVE 
THE IMPORTANT IDEA THAT EVERY 
DISABLED PERSON SHOULD HAVE A 
CHANCE TO HAVE EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITYS IN OUR COUNTRY WE 
RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF HELPING 
DISABLED PEEP INTO WORK WE WELCOME 
HIS CONCERN AND SHARE HIS AIMS AND 
DETERMINATION TO DO MORE THE 
GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED THE CROSS PARTY 
LIVING STRATEGY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE WILL 
MOVE FORWARD ON THAT L. AM HAPPY TO 
TALK WITH HIM ABOUT HOW WITHIN THE 
DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT WE 
CAN MOVE FORWARD THE PROPOSALS HE 
HAS PUT FORWARD 
WHILE THE PRIME MINISTER IS ON THE 
SUBJECT OF DISABLED PEOPLE IS HE 
AWARE THAT LABOUR'S ATTACK ON 
VULNERABLE PEOPLE HAS BEEN EXTENDED 
TO DISABLED ANGLERS AND THEY HAVE 
SEEN THAT THEIR FISHING LICENSE GO 
UP BY THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT AS OPPOSED TO TWO P. R. B. S. FOR 
ABLED BODY ABLE BODIED PEOPLE 
THAT IS IF THEY CAN FIND POST 
OFFICE TO BUY ONE FROM 
MR. SPEAKER 
I WILL LOOK AT THE FACTS HE BRINGS 
BEFORE US AND SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
TO BRING THAT ABOUT BUT I HAVE TO 
SAY TO THEM INVESTING IN RURAL 
COMMUNITIES IS SOMETHING THAT THIS 
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE AND ON THE 
POST OFFICES WE ARE MAKING ONE POINT SEVEN 
BILLION AVAILABLE 
MR. SPEAKER 
GIVEN THAT CRIME IN LONDON HAS 
FALLEN OVER RECENT YEARS DOES MY 
RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND THINK IT IS 
NOW TIME TO CUT NEIGHBOURHOOD 
POLICING TEAMS 
HE IS THE M. P. FOR SOUTHALL 
HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IT IS NOW IN 
ALL PARTS OF THE IN ALL PARTS OF 
ENGLAND THE REASON IS CRIME HAS 
GONE DOWN THERE IS A VISIBLE 
POLICE PRESENCE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE 
IN TOUCH WITH THE LOCAL POLICE 
FORCES AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY 
UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR OF LONDON 
CRIME HAS FALLEN BY FIFTEEN PER CENT THERE ARE 
SIX THOUSAND MORE POLICE OFFICERS FOUR THOUSAND 
MORE COMMUNITY SUPPORT OFFICERS AND 
THE ONE THING WHICH WOULD PUT THE 
POLICING OF LONDON AT RISK IS THE 
ELECTION OF CONSERVATIVE MAYOR 
A POINT OF ORDER SIR 
I RAISE POINT ONE HAVE GIVEN NOTICE I HAVE PERSUED THE CASE OF 
CONSTITUENT SINCE DECEMBER AND IN 
THIS PARTICULAR CASE 
DAVID CAMERON AT THE TOP THERE 
GOING VERY HARD ON FORTY TWO DAYS 
DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGE TRYING TO 
GOAD THE PRIME MINISTER INTO MAKING 
THAT INTO A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE ON 
THE GOVERNMENT NICK CLEGG WENT ON 
WHICH IS MORE OF 
DOORSTEP ISSUE THE CLOSURE OF POST 
OFFICES DARFUR WAS MENTIONED AND 
ALSO 
THE QUESTION OF FREE VOTE ON THE HUMAN FERTILISATION AND 
EMBRYOLOGY AUTHORTIY BILL WE HEAR 
FROM OUR EXPERTS IN A MOMENT FIRST 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT YOU AT HOME 
THOUGHT 
TWO MAIN THEMES THE THOUGHT PERFORMANCE AND WHETHER OR NOT WE 
AND JUDY AND THE TERROR 
LEGISLATION FIRST GRAHAM IN DURHAM 
SAYS I'M JUST PLAIN BOARD WITH 
THAT KNOCK ABOUT STUFF THE 
PERFORMANCE IN THE HOUSE TODAY HAS 
NOT INCLINED ME AT ALL TO VOTE 
TOMORROW I MIGHT PAINT THE BACK 
DOOR INSTEAD SOME PEOPLE DID 
ENJOY IT MARK SAYS I THINK DAVID 
CAMERON NEEDS TO GROW UP AND HAVE 
SERIOUS DEBATES INSTEAD OF MAKING 
GAGS ASK MEANINGFUL QUESTIONS 
ANDREW SAYS TODAY PMQ'S WAS 
BROWN'S BEST FROM WHEN HE STARTED 
IN THE JOB RON LEE SAYS GORDON 
BROWN HASN'T ANY HONEST ANSWERS TO 
THE QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM HE'S NOT 
UNLIKE GEORGE BUSH A LAME DUCK 
ROLL ON THE GENERAL ELECTION 
THERE WERE LOTS OF E. MAILS ABOUT 
THE TERROR LEGISLATION EXTENSION 
OF FORTY TWO DAYS JAMES SAYS DAVID 
CAMERON HAS JUST BLOWN HIS BIG 
OPPORTUNITY RE THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
WITH HIS PITCH OF CIVIL LIBERTIES 
MIDDLE ENGLAND COULDN'T CARE LESS 
HOW LONG YOU LOCK UP TERRORISTS 
TOM SELLS WITH THE ELECTIONS ABOUT 
TO HAPPEN WHY DID DAVID CAMERON GO 
ON ABOUT FORTY TWO DAYS D. MAY BE OF 
INTEREST IN WESTMINSTER BUT TO THE 
AVERAGE VOTER IT'S WEIGH DOWN OUR 
LIST STRONG FEELING ABOUT THE 
NEED TO EXTEND ON THE OTHER SIDE 
JOHN SAYS THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS FORTY TWO 
DAYS THAT'S THE FIRST I'VE HEARD 
OF IT L. DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY 
EVIDENCE TO EXTEND IT GARETH SAYS 
IF EVERY OTHER NATION IN THE 
WESTERN WORLD CAN COPE IN UNDER 
SEVEN DAYS WHY SHOULD THE BRITISH 
AUTHORITIES USE TWENTY EIGHT AND WHY EXTEND 
IT TO FORTY TWO 
KEVIN MAGUIRE IS STILL 
WITH US AND OUR OTHER GUESTS ARE 
THE E. MAILERS RIGHT DID DAVID 
CAMERON PICK A DUFF ISSUE THERE 
WHEN HE DECIDED TO GO SO STRONGLY 
ON FORTY TWO DAYS OR IS IT RESONATING ON 
THE DOORSTEP 
IT'S AN IMPORTANT 
ISSUE BUT HE PICKED THE WRONG TIME 
TO RAISE IT ON THE EVE OF LOCAL 
ELECTIONS YOU WANT TO CONVINCE 
PEOPLE WHY THEY SHOULD VOTE FOR YOU 
AND ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT AND 
NOT GETTING THEM TO VOTE LABOUR HE 
DIDN'T GET ON THAT ISSUE AT ALL L. 
WAS VERY SURPRISED HE DID IT THAT 
WAY NO MENTION OF LONDON WHERE OF 
COURSE ALL HIS HOPES REST ON BORIS 
JOHNSON WINNING PERHAPS HE IS 
GETTING COLD FEET NICK CLEGG 
PICKED THE ISSUE BUT HE DIDN'T DO 
IT VERY WELL HE ALLOWED 
BROWN TO COME BACK AND MAKE THE 
GOVERNMENT'S 
THOUGHT IT WAS 
CONFIDENT PERFORMANCE BY THE PRIME 
MINISTER DON'T AGREE WITH HIM ON 
FORTY TWO DAYS BUT I THOUGHT HE PUT HIS 
CASE WELL IF PUNCH AND JUDY 
POLITICS HAS BEEN GIVEN UP BY DAVID 
CAMERON IT HASN'T BY GORDON BROWN 
WHO DISMISSED HIM AS A SHALLOW 
SALESMAN 
IS HE RIDING FOR A FALL SALESMAN ON FORTY TWO DAYS GORDON BROWN BECAUSE 
DAVID CAMERON'S TACTIC WAS CLEAR HE 
WAS TRYING TO SET HIM UP FOR 
ANOTHER U. TURN SO THAT IF THE 
BACKBENCHERS WHO'VE ALREADY TASTED 
BLOOD TRY TO EXTRACT ANOTHER U. TURN 
FROM THE PRIME MINISTER OVER FORTY TWO 
DAYS THEN DAVID CAMERON CAN SAY AH 
BUT YOU SAID IT WAS A VOTE OF NEW 
CONFIDENCE GORDON BROWN DIDN'T 
FALL INTO THE TRAP GORDON BROWN 
WILL ABSOLUTELY STRUING 
TOLL GET THIS THROUGH AT THE 
MOMENT I CAN'T SEE HOW HE WILL GET 
IT THROUGH HE DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE 
IT A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE 
WAS HE 
CONVINCING WHEN HE TALK B. D. IT DID 
HE SOUND ENTHUSE YAFLTIC HIMSELF L. 
DIDN'T THINK HE SOUNDED 
PARTICULARLY PASSIONATE 
NO HE'S ON 
THE HOOK IT STARTD AS A POLITICAL 
ISSUE CAN YOU YOU CAN DIVIDE THE 
EXPERTS DAVID CAMERON CAN PLAY THE 
PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS THE PRIME 
MINISTER OTHERS HE'S IN A VERY 
DIFFICULT POSITION AND THE VOTE IS 
PUSHED RIGHT BACK TO JUNE YOU ARE 
GOING TO EXPECT CONCESSIONS I'M 
SURE IF PUSH COMES TO SHOVE HE 
THINKS HE'S GOING TO LOSE IT ON THE 
FLOOR HE WOULD RATHER SAY LOOK 
THERE'S NO CONSENSUS I SAID I 
WOULD TRY TO FIND ONE THEN IT WILL 
BE DEFEATED 
IS HE RIDING FOR A 
SHALL GOING TORE A FALL ON THIS I I THINK HE WAS VERY CONFIDENT AND 
ATHORITATIVE THE ISSUE OF FORTY TWO DAYS 
IS VERY IMPORTANT IT'S 
EXTRAORDINARY TO CONCENTRATE ON 
THAT TODAY THIS IS A VERY LONG 
ISSUE IN TERMS OF DAILY POLITICS AS 
THE OLD CLICHE A WEEK'S A LONG 
TIME BUT A DAY'S A LONG TIME 
TOMORROW WITH THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
AND AS YOU SAID NICK CLEGG BROUGHT 
UP THE ISSUES OF THE LOCAL ELECTION 
DOORSTEP ISSUES AND SO DID M. P.'S 
ROUND THE HOUSE L. THOUGHT ON ALL 
OF THOSE GORDON BROWN WAS VERY 
CONFIDENT VERY ATHORITATIVE HE 
DID HIS USUAL THING OF QUOTING 
STATISTICS BUT THE EXCHANGES WITH 
CAMERON I DIDN'T THINK WERE 
PARTICULARLY PUNCH AND JUDY THEY 
WERE LIKE A SECOND READING DEBATE 
ON SOMETHING WHICH HADN'T HAPPENED 
THEY WERE TRADING AUTHORITIES DO DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO 
A U. TURN ON FORTY TWO DAYS 
I'M NOT CLOSE 
ENOUGH TO THE WHIP'S ARITHMETIC ON 
THE VOTE L. SUSPECT THERE WILL BE A 
LONG PERIOD OF NEGOTIATION BUT AS 
WE HEARD JUST NOW IT'S NOT GOING 
TO HAPPEN FOR A FEW WEEKS THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE HAPPENING 
TOMORROW 
IF HE HAS TO DO A U. TURN TOMORROW HOW DAMAGING WOULD IT BE FOR HIM 
EVEN THOUGH LOCAL ELECTIONS WILL 
HAVE BEEN 
LET'S DEAL WITH THAT 
WHEN IT COMES IT MAY NOT BE A U. 
TURN IT MAY BE THAT THEY DO 
NEGOTIATIONS AND MAKE SOME POINTS 
AND LISTEN AND ALL THE THINGS WHICH 
GORDON BROWN SAID CLEARLY THIS 
MORNING WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR THERE 
YET WE AREN'T NEAR TO THE QUESTION 
OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A VOTE 
AND A U. TURN IT'S A LONG WAY AHEAD 
I THINK THERE WAS A FASCINATIC 
CHANGE OF TACK TODAY HE COULD HAVE 
GONE ON LOCAL ELECTIONS AND LONDON 
WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT HE DID 
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT WHICH WAS 
TO REALLY KEEP THE PRESSURE ON THE 
MISERY OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE THIS IS 
THE NEXT BIG PARLIAMENTARY ISSUE 
ALL OF US SUSPECT THAT GORDON BROWN 
IS GOING TO LOSE IT WHICH MOVES 
ONTO THE SECOND CHARGE THIS IS 
ABOUT POLITICS IT'S NOT ABOUT THE 
ISSUE AT 
IT'S PART OF A POLITICAL PLOY 
GORDON BROWN IS VERY POLITICAL 
POLITICIANS HE'S POLITICIAN'S 
POLITICIAN NOT LIKE TONY BLAIR WHO 
PLAYED UP THE MAN OF THE PEOPLE 
THING SO MUCH BETTER WE ALL KNOW 
THERE IS REAL CALCULATION GOING 
ON ABOUT FORTY TWO DAYS 
IS THIS WHAT THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE FOCUSING ON AS 
SHOWING HIM AS A POLITICAL 
MANIPULATIVE PERSON 
HE KNOWS HE'S 
GOING TO LOSE THIS A TONY BLAIR 
TYPE POLITICIANS WOULD SAY WE'RE 
NOT GOING TO GET THIS THROUGH 
LET'S START TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING 
ELSE GORDON BROWN'S GOING TO KEEP 
NICE OF YOU TO EULOGISE TONY 
ON BLAIR AFTERWARDS 
WHAT YOU'RE 
SAYING IS WHEN DAVID CAMERON MADE 
THE 
POLITICS ETC THE LABOUR BENCHES 
WERE THE ONES CHEERING HIM ON AND 
SAYING THIS IS THE LEGITIMATE 
ACCUSATION TO YOU 
THIS MAY NOT GO 
DOWN WELL TODAY IN A FEW WEEKS 
THIS WILL HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT 
QUESTION 
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME QUESTION EARLIER DISCUSSING WHETHER OR NOT 
THE FORMAT OF PRIME MINISTER'S 
QUESTIONS WAS THE ONE WHERE YOU GOT 
JUST THE SECOND READING DEBATE 
ABOUT A MAJOR ISSUE WHICH IS WHAT 
DAVID CAMERON WAS RATHER ODDLY 
TRYING TO DO THIS MORNING OR 
WHETHER YOU 
THE HEADLINES OF 
THE ISSUES FOR THE WEEK OR TOMORROW 
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT WAS MISTAKEN 
OF CAMERON TO DO THAT L. THINK 
GORDON BROWN RESPONDED TO ALL THE 
POINTS BOTH ON THE GENERAL ISSUES 
ON THE DOORSTEP THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS AND THE BROADER POINT 
ATHORITATIVELY 
IT'S RIGHT TO TALK ATHORITATIVELY ABOUT SERIOUS ISSUES THIS IS GOING 
TO BE THE SERIOUS ISSUE WHICH 
DOMINATES THE HOUSE OF COMMONS OVER 
THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS NOT NOT THE ONE THAT DOMINATES VOTING 
TOMORROW KEVIN GIVE US YOUR SUM 
UP THOUGHTS OF HOW THINGS WILL GO 
TOMORROW 
I WELL THE CONSERVATIVES TOMORROW WILL COME OUT ON TOP IT'S HOW 
BADLY LABOUR DO L. SUSPECT IT WON'T 
BE AS BAD AS FOUR YEARS AGO AND 
WILL GET OVER TWENTY SIX PER CENT PROBABLY A 
LITTLE COMFORT TO GORDON BROWN BUT 
IT WILL BE SOME COMFORT ALL EYES 
WILL BE ON LONDON THAT WILL BE 
TECTONIC 
YOU SEE THAT AS A BENCH TECTONIC MARK FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY IF IF DAVID CAMERON CAN'T GET HIS 
BULLINGDON CLUB FRIEND BORIS 
JOHNSON ELECTED AFTER EVERYTHING'S 
HAPPENED HE'S GOING TO HAVE 
PROBLEMS GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY 
AND DOING MAKING PROGRESS KEN 
LIVINGSTONE'S A DOUBTY FIRED L. 
HAVE MY HUNCH WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
IT'S TOO CLOSE TO CALL 
NO RESULTS 
UNTIL FRIDAY EVENING 
IF DAVID 
CAMERON WINS HE WILL CROW AND CROW 
WITH GOOD REASON BECAUSE HE WILL BE 
THAT BIT CLOSER TO DOWNING STREET 
IF KEN LIVINGSTONE HANGS ON GORDON 
BROWN WILL BE A MIGHTILY RELIEVED 
PRIME MINISTER 
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN 
NOW THE BEST SELLING CHILDREN'S 
AUTHOR ANTHONY HOROWITZ IS VERY 
BUSY MAN NOT CONTENT WITH WRITING 
MORE THAN FORTY NOVELS INCLUDING THE 
BEST SELLING ALEX RIDER SERIES 
WHICH HE BROUGHT TO THE BIG SCREEN 
HE'S BEHIND A NUMBER OF T. V. SERIES 
INCLUDING FOYLE'S WAR AND ACTING AS 
AMBASSADOR FOR THE NATIONAL YEAR OF 
READING LUCKILY FOR US HE TOOK 
TIME OUT FROM THAT SCRIBBLING 
WHY HE THINKS THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE FAILING TO GET 
ENOUGH OF OUR CHILDREN'S NOSES IN A 
BOOK 
I'M STANDING IN THE RATHER UNUSUAL 
ENVIRONMENT OF EVERTON FOOTBALL 
CLUB UNUSUAL BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL 
I'M CHILDREN'S AUTHOR AND 
BY THE BY I HAPPEN TO SUPPORT ARSENAL THE 
REASON I'M HERE IS NATIONAL YEAR OF 
READING I'M ON A BOOK TOUR TO 
NORTH OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND FAR 
AWAY FROM THE USUAL PREP SCHOOLS 
AND LEAFY GLAIDS OF KENT AND 
GUILDFORD 
HOW MANY KIDS ARE HAVE GUILDFORD YOU GOT 
WHEN I LAST LOOKED TWO 
I'VE TALKING TO A CROWD OF NINE HUNDRED 
CHILDREN WHICH HAD AMONGST THEM 
DISABLED CHILDREN OFFENDERS HARD 
OF HEARING OR HEARING IMPAIRED 
THIS IS WITH MY VIEW THAT LITERACY 
SHOULD EMBRACE ALL CHILDREN FROM 
ALL BACKGROUNDS IT'S A MISTAKE TO 
TREAT BOOKS LIKE MEDICINE TO MAKE 
BETTER PEOPLE L. PASSIONATELY 
BELIEVE THAT READING AND LITERACY 
CAN BE AN ANSWER TO MANY OF 
SOCIETY'S PROBLEMS BECAUSE BOOKS 
STORY TELLING DO CONNECT PEOPLE 
SPEAKING PERSONALLY I'M AMAZED 
THAT AFTER TEN YEARS OF A 
GOVERNMENT THAT 
HAVE ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN LEAVING 
SCHOOL FUNCTIONALLY UNABLE TO READ 
IT ALSO BOTHERS ME THAT WE SPEND SO 
MUCH TIME DEMON IEGZ THE YOUNGER 
GENERATION WITH TALK OF ASBOS 
HOODIES AND DRUNKENNESS ON ESTATES 
CHILDREN WHO READ ARE BETTER THAN 
THAT ALTHOUGH THE NATIONAL YEAR OF 
READ ING IS A GREAT START IT IS 
JUST A START I'D LOVE TO SEE MORE 
TIME IN SCHOOLS READING FOR 
PLEASURE LESS ABOUT THE CURRICULUM 
AND TARGETS READING MAKES 
CIVILISED PEOPLE IS AN ANSWER 
TO MANY OF SOCIETY'S PROBLEMS WELL WELL I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT ANTHONY 
HOROWITZ JOINS US NOW IN THE STUDIO 
THANKS FOR COMING IN AND FOR 
LETTING US LOOK AT WHAT YOU WERE UP 
TO IN LIVERPOOL THERE WHERE DO YOU 
THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED IN 
GETTING KIDS TO READ MORE 
IT'S NOT 
SO MUCH A FAILING IT'S MORE A 
QUESTION OF NOT DOING ENOUGH THE 
NATIONAL YEAR OF READING WHICH I'M 
PART OF IS A GOOD MOVE AND A STEP 
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHERE I 
THINK SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG IS 
AT THE LEVEL OF SCHOOLS SCHOOLS 
THAT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES 
ENOUGH LIBRARIES ENOUGH MONEY 
SPENT ON THAT SIDE OF IT BUT ABOVE 
ALL ENOUGH TIME TO SIT DOWN AND 
EJOIN READING NOT STUDY TEXT NOT 
DO BITS OF SHAKESPEARE AND TRY AND 
DIE SECT IT BUT TO DISCOVER THE 
PLEASURE OF READING WHAT IS 
MISSING VERY MUCH IS A CANON THAT 
IS TO SAY SOMETHING THAT ALL 
SCHOOLS CAN READ TOGETHER A SCHOOL 
THAT READS TOGETHER DOES BECOME A 
COMMUNITY I SEE IT OVER AND OVER 
AT THE SAME TIME THE GOVERNMENT 
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT HAVE SAID IN ALL PRIMARY 
SCHOOLS THERE HAS TO BE AN HOUR OF 
LITERACY EVERY DAY HOW COULD THEY 
FIND MORE TIME FOR READING BY BY DROPPING OTHER THINGS AND PERHAPS 
BEING LESS LEAGUE ORIENTED L. WAS 
AT A SCHOOL THE OTHER WEEK IT WAS 
A WONDERFUL SCHOOL BUT IT HAD EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT 
OF THE KIDS THERE WERE 
MULTICULTURAL THEY WERE NOT WHITE 
OF THAT FIFTY FOUR PER CENT WERE ENGLISH AS A 
SECOND LANGUAGE YET THIS WAS A 
VERY CULTIVATED IT WAS ILFORD 
COUNTY SCHOOL THE ATMOSPHERE THERE 
THE CULTURE THE INTELLIGENCE WAS 
CONNECTED WITH THE FACT THAT ONE 
IT HAD A WELL STOCKED LIBRARY TWO 
AS I WAS GOING ROUND THE SCHOOL I 
SCHTUMBLED UPON A CLASS JUST 
READING FOR AN HOUR IN SILENCE FOR 
PLEASURE THOSE TWO THINGS HAVE GOT 
TO BE IN SOME WAY NON CO IPBS 
DENTAL THAT WAS GRAMMAR SCHOOL 
THEY HAD THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THOSE 
DECISIONS I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT 
IN ALL SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
CAN YOU 
PUT IT DOWN TO WHAT SCHOOLS AND THE 
GOVERNMENT DO PARENTS HAVE AN 
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY TOO SURELY 
PARENTS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING 
CHILDREN TO READ MANY KIDS DON'T 
EVEN HAVE BOOKS IN THE HOUSE CAN 
WE SAY IT'S ALL DOWN TO MINISTERS 
I DON'T SAY THAT THERE'S ONLY SO 
MUCH A GOVERNMENT CAN DO A 
GOVERNMENT THINKS IT CAN REMOULD 
SOCIETY AND GET PARENTS TO READ 
WITH THEIR KIDS ARE ON A LOSING 
STREETS ALL PARENTS FIND IT VERY 
HARD TO FIND THAT HALF HOUR AT EIGHT P. M. 
TO SIT DOWN WITH THEIR KIDS AND 
READ HAVING BEEN PARENT MYSELF 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE VALUABLE IF 
YOU WANT TO GET ONTO THE SAME LEVEL 
AND SAME PLAYING FIELD AS YOUR KIDS 
AND BECOME VERY CLOSE TO THEM THE 
BEST WAY IS WITH A BOOK THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN'T PUSH PARENTS INTO 
THE BEDROOM AND MAKE THEM DO IT 
MIGHT THERE BEEN AN ISSUE ABOUT 
WHAT BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE IF YOU 
HAVE A SET UP WITH PARENTS SIT DOWN 
FOR HALF AN HOUR NOT ALL CHILDREN 
ARE INTO READING SOME MIGHT RATHER 
KICK A BALL OR PLAY A VIDEO GAME 
CAN YOU FORCE THEM 
YOU CAN'T IF 
THE GOVERNMENT IN THE NATIONAL YEAR 
OF READING TRIES TO MAKE READING 
SOMETHING TO DO THEN THE 
INEVITABLE REACTION IS TO DO THE 
OPPOSITE I FOR ONE DON'T SMOKE 
CIGARETTES ON NATIONAL SMOKING DAY 
I ALWAYS LIGHT UP JUST TO MAKE THE 
POINT I TAKE YOUR POINT READING 
IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY THE 
AVAILABILITY OF BOOKS BEING 
SURROUNDED BY THEM HAVING THE TIME 
TO READ IS LIKELY TO CREATE READERS 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS HOW DO WE 
MAKE KIDS MORE INTERESTED IN 
READING 
MY CHILDREN WILL BE MORE READING IMPRESSED THAT I AM ON THE SAME 
SHOW AS ANTHONY HOROWITZ THAN WHEN 
WE LISTENED TO THE PRIME MINISTER 
HE WRITES READABLE BOOKS YOU PUT 
YOUR FINGER ON IT IT IS ABOUT THE 
RELATIONSHIP PARENTS HAVE WITH 
SCHOOLS AND PARENTS HAVE WITH 
CHILDREN IN ENCOURAGING THEM TO 
READ WE NEED TO IT IS A CULTURAL 
THING WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE 
BOOKS IN THEIR HOMES MORE 
LIBRARIES STOP LIBRARIES BEING 
CLOSED DOWN ENCOURAGE CHILDREN 
GOING TO LIBRARIES SEEING BOOKS AS 
ENTERTAINMENT RATHER THAN SOMETHING 
INTELLECTUAL THAT YOU HAVE TO READ 
IN TERMS OF TEXT BOOKS AND THEY ARE 
TRAVELLING THEY NEED BOOKS WITH 
THEM 
ANTHONY PUT HIS FINGER ON THEM SOMETHING HE IS WORRIED ABOUT THE 
TESTING CULTURE CULTURE IN SCHOOLS 
WHICH MAKES READING SEEM LIKE BAD 
MEDICINE 
I CAN JOIN THE ANTHONY MEDICINE HOROWITZ FAN CLUB 
I DECIDED WHEN I HEARD YOU WERE ON 
THIS PROGRAMME TO TALK TO MY FOCUS 
GROUP OF MY NINE YEAR OLD 
GRANDDAUGHTER ABOUT WHAT SHE WAS 
READING SHE WENT INTO A SPIRAL OF 
DELIGHT SAYING SHE HAD READ ALL THE 
ALEX RIDER BOOKS AND WHY WEREN'T 
THERE MORE SHE DOES NOT GO TO 
SCHOOL IN A LAEFY SUBURB OR WHERE 
EVER IT WAS SAY SAID YOU WERE 
TRYING NOT TO VISIT THERE IS 
ENORMOUS VALUE IN READING ONE OF 
THE INTERESTING POINTS IS ABOUT THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE KIND OF 
COMMUNITY WHAT DID YOU DESCRIBE IT 
COMMUNITY READING WHERE WHOLE 
SCHOOLS 
A CANNON YES MOST SCHOOLS MOST SCHOOL I AM MORE FAMILIAR WITH 
PRIMARY SCHOOLS THAN SECONDARY 
SCHOOLS BUT THEY HAVE SENSE THEY 
WANT TO EXPAND READING AM 
PROBABLY MORE OF THE NANNY STATE 
PERSUASION I BELIEVE IN PROJECTS 
LIKE THE YEAR OF READING EVEN BELIEVE IN NO SMOKING DAY 
AM A 
RECONSTRUCTED NANNY IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO GIVE CHILDREN TIME TO 
DO THAT AND IT IS DIFFICULT IN 
PEOPLE'S PRESSURED LIVES TO MAKE A 
SENSIBLE ALLOWANCE FOR THAT IN YOUR 
HOME LIFE 
ANTHONY I WANT TO MAKE 
TIME FOR A POINT IF THERE IS ONE 
THING YOU WANT POLITICIAN TO DO 
WHAT WOULD IT BE 
LARGELY TO KEEP 
OUT 
THAT IN ITSELF IS A MESSAGE L. OUT I DON'T THINK IT CAN COME FROM 
GOVERNMENT AT THE END OF THE DAY L. 
AM SUPPORTING THE YEAR OF READING 
I AM ONE OF THE AMBASSADORS BY AND 
LARGE IT HAS TO HAPPEN AT SCHOOL 
AND HOUSE LEVEL THANK YOU 
NOW LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM THEY 
ARE EVERY WHERE POLLS THAT IS I 
DON'T MEAN THE MIGRANTS OPINION 
POLLS ARE PROLIFIC DO WE BELIEVE 
THEM HOW ACCURATE ARE THEY WE 
SENT GILES OUT TO CONDUCT THE MOST 
UNSCIENTIFIC POLL OF ALL ABOUT 
POLLING OPINION IS DIVIDED ON 
OPINION POLLS POLITICIANS ARE 
WEARY WHEN THEY ARE KIND 
DISMISSIVE WHEN THEY ARE NOT THEY THEY WERE WRONG THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
WAS RIGHT 
AND IT SEEMS WE ARE ALSO 
SCEPTICAL IT IS A FAR CRY FROM THE 
INNOCENT DAYS WHEN THE POLLS 
STARTED 
I AM FROM NATIONAL OPINION STARTED POLLS I WONDER IF YOU MIND ME 
ASKING YOU A FEW SIMPLE QUESTIONS 
POLLING HAS CHANGED LOT SINCE 
THEN FOR ONE THING I AM NOT BLACK 
AND WHIELT AND NOT TALKING LIKE 
THIS WE ARE GOING TO COMMISSION AN 
UNSCIENTIFIC POLL OF OUR OWN WITH 
A STATISTICALLY MINDED PRODUCER 
WHAT DO PEOPLE MAKE OF THESE 
OPINION POLLS ANY WAY 
I JUST THINK PEOPLE DO TEND TO LIE 
I THINK I DON'T KNOW I THINK 
PEOPLE TELL YOU WHAT THEY WANT YOU 
TO HEAR A LOT OF THE TIME L. DON'T 
THINK THEY CONVEY THEIR TRUE 
BELIEFS 
I KNOW THEY PUT A LOT OF BELIEFS EFFORT IN TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT 
WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY RIGHT ON 
THE POLITICAL FRONT I BELIEVE THEM 
MORE THAN I WOULD THAN SOMEONE 
SPURIOUS TYPES 
WOULD I LIE TO YOU 
IT IS CONFUSING 
YOU CAN SEE WHAT 
THEY MEAN THESE ARE THE LATEST 
MAYORAL POLLS ONE HAS BORIS OUT IN 
FRONT ANOTHER HAS KEN NARROWLY 
AHEAD THESE WERE TAKEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
APART HOW RELIABLE ARE THEY THESE 
ARE OURS TOTALLY UNSCIENTIFIC WE 
ASKED DO YOU TRUST THE POLLS SIXTEEN 
SAID THEY DID TWENTY FOUR SAID THEY DIDN'T 
WOULD IT CHANGE YOUR VOTE THIRTY EIGHT OUT 
OF THE FORTY SAID NO HERE IS THE 
INTERESTING ONE WOULD YOU LIE TEN 
TOLD THE TRUTH AND SAID THEY WOULD 
LIE THIRTY SAID THEY WOULD NEVER LIE 
WOULD I LIE TO YOU YES I WOULD 
WHY 
I DON'T THINK I THINK THERE WHY IS AN ELEMENT OF MISCHIEF ON IT 
THAT YOU CAN GET ONE OVER ON THE 
MAN 
WOULD YOU LIE L. MIGHT TO BE MAN I MIGHT TO BE HONEST BUT I SUPPOSE THAT IS A 
TERRIBLE THING TO SAY 
WOULD YOU 
CONSIDER LIEING TO ME POSSIBLY POSSIBLY SO YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT LYING BUT 
THINK YOU WOULD END UP TELLING THE 
TRUTH 
IN THE END 
THAT WOULD BE TRUTH LIE 
NO IT 
WOULD BE THE TRUTH IT LIE IT WOULD DEPEND WHAT MOOD I WAS IN I I THINK PEOPLE ARE MORE CONCERNED 
ABOUT LOOKING STUPID THAN THEY ARE 
ABOUT HAVING THEIR GENUINE OPINIONS 
LISTENED TO 
HOWEVER STUPID THAT 
MIGHT BE POLLS HAVE THEIR DRAWBACKS 
IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THEY WERE VERY WRONG 
ABSOLUTELY FARCICAL THEY HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT INTO DISREPUTE AND DISGRACE 
THAT IS FROM A PROVEN LIAR DESPITE 
NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE MOST ACCURATE POLLS HAVE 
BEEN THOSE DONE ON THE EVE OF 
ELECTION BY THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL 
WAIT FOR THE REAL THING 
WE ARE JOINED BY THE KING OF THE 
SWING SWINGOMETRE PETER SNOW WHO 
ENJOYED THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS 
UNSCIENTIFIC WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF 
POLLS WHICH GOT IT WRONG WHAT WAS 
THE WORST POLL YOU DID THE ONE 
WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE THE MOST 
INACCURATE 
I SUPPOSE IT HAS TO BE INACCURATE NINETEEN NINETY TWO I REMEMBER WE WERE TOLD ABOUT 
FORTY FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE PROGRAMME 
THE B. B. C. EXIT POLL WAS LOOKING LIKE 
LABOUR MAYBE SLIGHTLY AHEAD THEN 
MERCIFULLY AT NINE FIFTY FIVE P. M. I WAS 
STANDING THERE FOR A STORY WANTING 
TO KNOW WHAT THE POLL RESULT WOULD 
BE AND FOUND OUT IT WAS JOHN MAJOR 
JUST AHEAD IN A HUNG PARLIAMENT OF 
COURSE THAT WAS THE AN 
EXTRAORDINARY EXCITING STORY HUNG 
PARLIAMENT HAD NOT HAD ONE FOR 
YEARS BASILDON CAME UP BLUE 
BASILDON WAS SUPPOSED TO GO RED IT 
WAS GOING TO BE A HUNG PARLIAMENT 
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH 
THAT POLL 
HAVE WE GOT A NATIONAL 
OBSESSION ABOUT THEM ARE THEY ANY 
GOOD 
WE HAVE A NATIONAL OBSESSION GOOD THEY ARE THE CURRENCY OF POLITICS 
BELIEVE ME DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND 
EVEN ON ELECTION NIGHT IT IS 
ENORMOUSLY EXCITING 
WHEN YOU WAIT 
FOR THAT FIGURE 
HUGELY EXCITING 
ARE THEY TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE 
ANSWER IS YES FOR GOODNESS SAKE 
THE ACID TEST IS THE PRIME MINISTER 
HIMSELF WHEN THE POLLS LOOKED 
FAVOURABLE FOR LABOUR IT LOOKED 
LIKE AN ELECTION WAS ON WHEN THEY 
LOOKED UNFAVOURABLE THE ELECTION 
WAS OFF THEY ARE DEADLY SERIOUS 
FOR POLITICIANS AS FAR AS YOU AND 
I ARE CONCERNED THEY ARE USUALLY 
PRETTY RIGHT YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE 
ERROR SINCE ONE EIGHT NINE FOUR FIVE IN ALL THE POLLS 
HAS BEEN TWO PER CENT FOR EACH PARTY TWO PER CENT 
SOMETIMES MIND YOU IT IS MORE THAN 
THAT BUT THEY ARE PRETTY GOD 
THEIR RECORD IS IMPRESSIVE THERE 
ARE MORE THAN THE WEATHER FORECAST 
WHICH IS NOT HARD ECONOMICS IS 
DIFFERENT MATTER ENTIRELY LORD 
STRATHCLYDE THE POLITICIANS LOVE 
THEM OR HATE THEM DEPENDING ON 
WHETHER THEY TELL THE RIGHT STORY 
THEY DECRY POLLS THEY ARE OBSESSED 
ABOUT THEM IF THERE IS A POLL IN 
THE NEWSPAPER THE FIRST PAGE WHAT 
DOES THE POLL SAY THEN YOU SAY 
THAT CANNOT BE RIGHT OR THAT MUST 
BE TRUE THEY PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT 
ROLE THINK HE IS RIGHT ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EVENING 
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF ANALYSIS 
DONE AFTERWARDS IT APPEARED SOME 
PEOPLE WENT INTO THE POLLING BOOTH 
SAYING THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE 
LABOUR VOTED CONSERVATIVE CAME 
OUT AND SAID THEY HAD VOTED LABOUR 
THE PEOPLE WHO LIED 
PEOPLE DID LIE 
IT WAS CONFUSSING IT WAS A STRANGE 
PERIOD JO AND THAT PROBLEM WENT ON 
THROUGH THE NINETEEN NINETIES INTO THE TWO THOUSAND 
THOUSAND PEOPLE SAYING THEY WERE 
SHY TO SAY THEY WERE VOTING TORY 
ALL THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN STIRRED 
AROUND 
IT MAKES FOR GREAT GRAPHICS AROUND AND PROGRAMMES ON ELECTION NIGHT 
DO YOU THINK THE AUDIENCE REALLY 
LIKE THEM IS IT ALL OF US MAKING 
WORK AND MAKING FUN FOR EACH OTHER 
VERY FEW PEOPLE ADMIT TO HAVING 
BEEN POLLED THEMSELVES WHERE DO 
THESE POLLSTERS GET THE PEOPLE FROM 
TO SAY THEY WILL DO THIS OR THAT 
NO ONE EVER ASKED ME WITH THE 
INCREASE NOW OF USING THE INTERNET 
FOR POLLING FAR MORE PEOPLE ARE 
INVOLVED WHETHER IT MAKES THEM ANY 
MORE ACCURATE 
WE ARE SEEING THAT 
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT 
PLAYS OUT DURING THE YEAR WE HAVE 
SEEN IT IN THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS 
IN HAMPSHIRE WASN'T THERE IT IT ENABLES PEOPLE TO BE MORE DISHONEST 
IF YOU TALK TO A LOT A BLACK 
POLITICIANS IN AMERICA IT IS LIKE 
THEM SAYING THEY WERE NOT VOTING 
CONSERVATIVES IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES PEOPLE 
WILL SAY TO THE EXIT POLLSTERS I 
WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEA A BLACK 
MAN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES WHRORPBLTS THEY VOTE THAT 
WAY 
IS THE CRUCIAL QUESTION WHAT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS HOW THE QUESTION IS 
BASED ONE WORD CAN MAKE A WORLD OF 
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE THEY SAY IT IS A SPECIFIC SCIENCE 
AND THE POLLING INDUSTRY IS MASSIVE 
NOW 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY HUGE A VERY NOW INEXACT SCIENCE OUR JOB AS 
JOURNALISTS IS TO EXPLAIN HOW 
UNEXACT IT IS DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I 
AM SAYING BUT HERE IS THE RESULT 
BEAR IN MIND THEY HAVE BEEN RIGHT 
IN THE PAST THEY HAVE BEEN VERY 
CLOSE LAST ELECTION THEY WERE 
CLOSE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THEY HAVE BEEN RIGHT 
IN THE PAST HERE YOU ARE FOR WHAT 
IT IS WORTH THEY HAVE A STAB AT 
GETTING PUBLIC OPINION RIGHT THEY 
HAVE BEEN PRETTY RIGHT IN THE PAST 
I WILL TELL ONE MORE STORY YOU 
TALKED ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN I WAS 
WORKING ON ELECTION PROGRAMMES IN 
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THERE WAS THE CLASSIC 
NINETEEN SEVENTY GENERAL ELECTION WHEN HAROLD 
WILSON WAS EXPECTED TO WIN IT WAS 
EXACTLY THE SAME SITUATION AND 
THERE WE WERE AND THOSE OF US WHO 
WERE WORKING ON THE ELECTION 
PROGRAMME WITH ALL OUR FILM LINED 
UP OF THESE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE IN 
THE CABINET AND YESTERDAY'S MEN OF 
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND THEN IT 
WAS GRAVESEND WHICH CAME IN FIRST 
NOT BASILDON THE ATMOSPHERE OF 
HORROR AND ALL OF US IN THE BACK 
ROOM SPENT ALL NIGHT RE CUTTING 
THESE FILMS THESE WERE NEW FACES 
OF THE CABINET RATHER THAN 
YESTERDAY'S MEN 
IT HAS BEEN LOVELY 
TO HAVE YOU ON EVEN THOUGH YOU 
DON'T DO THE SWINGOMETRE ANY MORE 
I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER ELECTION 
NIGHT AS THE SWINGOMETRE THE 
ANSWER TO GUESS THE YEAR IT WAS 
HARD THIS WEEK YOU ARE GETTING TOO 
GOOD AT IT IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT'S 
DEFEAT ON THE FUEL TAX INCREASE WAS 
THE CLUE DID YOU REMEMBER WHEN IT 
HAPPENED IN A MINUTE OUR GUESTS 
WILL PICK A WINNER LET'S SEE IF 
YOU WERE RIGHT 
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR LOTS OF YOU GOT IT RIGHT 
TIME TO PICK A WINNER L. REGARD 
THIS AS BEING THE MOST RESPONSIBLE 
THING I HAVE DONE ALL DAY THE 
WINNER IS JANET LOTT OF TWENTY SEVENTH 
SOUTHPORT CLOSE COVENTRY GOOD TO 
SEE A WOMAN WINNING ON AN ALL WOMAN

GUESTS ANDREW WILL BE BACK
