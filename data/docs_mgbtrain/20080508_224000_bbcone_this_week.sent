TONIGHT WE REVIEW THE POLITICAL 
FILMS OF THE WEEK 
NIGHTMARE ON DOWNING STREET 
STARRING GORDON BROWN 
I LET SPECULATION ABOUT THE GENERAL 
ELECTION GO TOO LONG L. ADMITTED 
THAT WAS A PROBLEM THAT I THINK WAS 
THERE THERE PERHAPS I'VE SPENT TOO LITTLE TIME 
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET OUR 
ARGUMENTS ACROSS TO THE PUBLIC 
TONY BLAIR'S FORMER CHIEF STRATEGY 
ADVISOR GIVES HIS VERDICT GORDON GORDON BROWN IS ON THE ROPES HE STILL HAS 
A CHANCE IF HE COMES OUT FIGHTING 
THE REMAKE OF A CONSERVATIVE 
CLASSIC GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDS 
STARRING BORIS JOHNSON 
I KNOW 
THERE WILL BE MANY WHOSE PENCILS 
HOVERED FOR AN INSTANT BEFORE 
PUTTING AN X. IN MY BOX I'LL WORK 
FLAT OUT TO JUSTIFY YOUR CONFIDENCE 
DAILY MIRROR KEVIN MAGUIRE GIVES 
HIS RATINGS 
DID PICKSY DUST GET 
THE BLONDE BOMB SHELL INTO THE CITY 
HALL IF SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
FOR GORDON BROWN'S LABOUR PARTY 
AND CANNABIS THE REAL STORY 
CERTIFICATE EIGHTEEN AMERICAN FILM MAKER 
MORGAN SPURLOCK SHINES THE 
SPOTLIGHT ON OUR ADDICTION TO 
ADDICTION 
BUT HOW DID WE GET ADDICTION ADDICTION WAY WHY ARE SO MANY OF ADDICTED TO 
SO MANY THINGS 
EVENIN' ALL WELCOME TO THIS WEEK 
LAST WEEK WAS REAL POLITICAL 
HUMDINGER SO NATURALLY WE WEREN'T 
ON AIR 
CAN I JUST SAY TO THE SCHEDULEERS 
WE KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE KNOW TWO 
PEOPLE COMING ROUND TO SEE YOU BUT 
WE'RE NOT COMING ROUND JUST YET 
THIS HAS ALSO BEEN BLOCKBUSTER OF 
A WEEK AND HERE WE ARE BACK IN OUR 
PRIME TIME SLOT PRIME TIME THAT 
IS IF YOU'RE ON THE NIGHTSHIFT 
OUR GREAT LEADER IN DOWNING STREET 
OF COURSE IS ON EVERY SHIFT DAY 
AND NIGHT HE'S EVEN ASSURED US 
THAT OUR MORTGAGES AND OUR JOBS ARE 
THE FIRST THING HE THINKS OF EVERY 
MORNING AS HE LEAPS OUT OF THE BED 
AFTER A LIE IN AT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY AND JUMPS 
INTO THE SHOWER WITH THE ARCTIC 
MONKEYS I KNOW HE FEELS OUR PAIN 
BECAUSE HE TOLD ANDREW MARR ON 
SUNDAY WHICH UNDERLINES HOW 
SELFLESS HE IS BECAUSE NOBODY IS 
SUFFERING MORE PAIN THAN THE GREAT 
LEADER HIMSELF BUT WITH BOJO 
SWEEPING TO POWER IN LONDON THE 
TORIES GETTING THE BIGGEST SHARE OF 
THE VOTE SINCE THEN SENT KIDS UP 
CHIMNEYS AND EVEN THE SISTER HE 
NEVER HAD WEE WENDY MCNUMPTY 
CAUSING HIM PROBLEMS IN HIS OWN 
BACK YARD ON TOP OF ALL THAT HE 
HAS TO BE CHEERED UP BY TONY AND 
CHERIE BUYING THEIR OWN STATE HEE 
PILE IN THE COUNTRY 
SPEAKING OF NUMPTIES WE HAVE TWO 
OF BRITAIN'S FINEST PORTILLO 
POEFRT AND DIANE ABOTT MICHAEL 
YOUR MOMENT OF THE WEEK 
LAST YEAR A CATASTROPHIC WAY OF 
PROMOTING DOCTORS WAS INTRODUCED 
WHICH PLUNGED THE NATIONAL HEALTH 
SERVICE INTO A DISASTER AND WE LOST 
LOST OF DOCTORS FROM THE PROFESSION 
ALTOGETHER ALTOGETHER A COMMITTEE OF M. P.'S TOLD US TODAY 
THAT THIS WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF 
LIAM DONALDSON THE CHIEF MEDICAL 
OFFICER AND HE FAILED TO SHOW 
LEADERSHIP AND FAILED TO TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY I LISTENED TO HIM 
THIS MORNING DEFENDING HIS POSITION 
AND HE REFUSED TO GO ON THE TODAY 
PROGRAMME SO THE CHARGE THAT YOU 
WON'T SHOW LEADERSHIP AND WON'T 
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY APPEARS TO BE 
PROVEN TO ME L. THINK IT'S 
UNACCEPTABLE FOR A PUBLIC OFFICIAL 
TO CAUSE A MASSIVE COCK UP LIKE 
THIS AND THEN NOT APPEAR AND 
EXPLAIN HIMSELF BY THE WAY THIS IS 
ALL A DIVERSION FROM THE FACT THAT 
MINISTERS ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE AND 
WHERE ARE THEY 
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET 
A PEERAGE 
DIANE YOUR MOMENT OF THE WEEK KEN KEN LIVINGSTONE'S CONCESSION SPEECH 
LATE ON FRIDAY NIGHT 
IT FEELS ON THE LEFT OF THE 
POLITICS KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS 
DOMINATED LONDON POLITICS FOR ABOUT 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHATEVER YOU THINK OF HIM 
THIS IS CLEARLY HE'S NOT GOING TO 
COME BACK INTO ELECTORAL POLITICS 
SO IT WAS THE END OF AN ERA YES YES AND REALLY QUITE SAD 
DO YOU EVER 
GET THAT SPOOKY FEELING OF BEING 
SOMEWHERE AND THINKING I'VE BEEN 
HERE BEFORE BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER 
WHEN OR WHY L. KNOW I DO AROUND 
ELEVEN POINT THREE OH EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT IN FACT 
I DON'T WANT TO SCARE YOU BUT IT'S 
HAPPENING ALL OVER BRITAIN THINK 
OF IT AN EMBATTLED AND UNPOPULAR 
PRIME MINISTER KNOCKED FOR SIX BY 
TERRIBLE LOCAL ELECTION RESULTS 
ENDLESS RELAUNCHES OF A PRIME 
MINISTER WHICH TURN OUT TO BE DEAD 
CAT BOUNCEIES A FACTION RIDDEN 
RULING PARTY KEENER TO KNOCK LUMPS 
OUT OF EACH OTHER THAN THE OTHER 
SIDE A BRIGHT YOUNG OPPOSITION 
LEADER CATCHING THE NATION'S 
IMAGINATION OH YES COULD IT BE 
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE ALL OVER AGAIN WE ALL KNOW 
HOW THAT STORY ENDED FOR JOHN MAJOR 
CAN OUR GREAT LEADER REALLY BE 
DESTINED FOR THE SAME OBLIVION IS 
THERE NO JUSTICE IN THE WORLD IS 
THE GREATEST COMEBACK SINCE TAKE 
THAT REALLY BE BEYOND HIM WE ASKED 
TONY BLAIR'S FORMER CHIEF STRATEGY 
VIFRPL MATT TAYLOR FOR HIS VERDICT 
ELEVEN YEARS AGO IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL 
MORNING LIKE TODAY'S WAS DAWNING 
I STOOD OUTSIDE THAT BUILDING 
CHEERING AS LABOUR WERE SWEPT TO 
OFFICE LAST WEEK I HAD TO ADMIT 
THAT ERA IS COMING TO AN END 
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT LAST WEEK WELL 
IT WAS BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE DAYS OF 
BRIT POP AND COOL BRITANNIA A 
TIRED UNPOPULAR GOVERNMENT A 
CONFIDENT PHOTOGENIC LEADER OF THE 
OPPOSITION BUT IS DAVID CAMERON 
THE NEW TONY BLAIR AND IS GORDON 
BROWN THE NEW JOHN MAJOR 
NOT EVERYTHING TODAY IS LIKE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
LABOUR HAVE GOT THEIR PROBLEMS 
THEY'VE MADE MISTAKES BUT THERE 
HASN'T BEEN A WATERSHED MOMENT LIKE 
BLACK WEDNESDAY THE DOOR IS 
CLOSING ON GORDON BROWN BUT THE 
BOLTS ARE NOT YET FASTENED 
IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS TONY BLAIR 
STOOD FOR FOR THE FUTURE FOR 
FAIRNESS FOR STRONG LEADERSHIP 
NOW DAVID CAMERON HAS GOT RID OF 
MOST OF THE CONSERVATIVES' 
NEGATIVES BUT HE HASN'T YET GOT 
HIS OWN MANTRA BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE 
GORDON BROWN IS IN DEEP TROUBLE IF 
I WAS A BETTING MAN WELL I'D HAVE 
TO PUT MY MONEY ON THE TORIES BUT 
THERE IS A WAY FORWARD IF I WAS IN 
MY OLD JOB BACK IN DOWNING STREET 
I'D HAVE A THREE STEP PLAN FOR 
GORDON BROWN 
STEP ONE FORGET THE OPINION POLLS 
FORGET THE HEADLINES FOCUS 
ENTIRELY ON WHAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE IN 
THE NEXT TWO YEARS IN GOVERNMENT 
STEP TWO MAKE SOME COMMITMENTS 
THAT REALLY MATTER TO PEOPLE ON 
POVERTY ON THE ECONOMY ON PUBLIC 
SERVICES BUT KEEP THEM SIMPLE 
STEP THREE ON EVERYTHING ELSE 
LEAVE IT TO THE CABINET DON'T 
INTERFERE THAT'S WHY YOU APPOINTED 
THEM YOU'RE FOCUSING BIG THINGS 
LOOK GORDON IT'S NOT AN EASY 
STRATEGY BUT IT'S ONLY WHEN THINGS 
ARE TOUGH THAT WE REALLY FIND 
WHAT OUR LEADERS ARE MADE OF 
MATTHEW TAYLOR ON THE THAMES THERE 
AND NOW IN OUR STUDIO THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS A WEEK AGO LABOUR HAD 
THE WORST RESULT SINCE THE SECOND 
WORLD WAR THERE'S A POLL IN THE 
SUN TOMORROW GIVING THE TORIES A 
TWENTY SIX POINT LEAD LABOUR'S WORST 
RESULT SINCE POLLING RECORDS BEGAN 
WHY HAS IT ALL GONE SO WRONG THERE THERE HAVE BEEN A WHOLE SERIES OF THINGS 
THE FAUX ELECTION NORTHERN ROCK 
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND THEN TEN P. TAX 
ALL THESE THINGS ADDED TOGETHER 
HAVE LED TO THE SITUATION AND 
THERE'S A FEELING OF TERMINAL VERY 
LOSSITY 
JUST REINFORCING ITSELF LOSSITY YEAH IF WE LOOK AT THE POLL WE'RE 
GOING TO SEE TOMORROW IN THE PAPERS 
THERE'S HUGE CONSERVATIVE LEAD 
WE HAVE TO NOTICE OVER THE LAST FEW 
WEEKS WE'VE SEEN PENDULUM SWINGS 
DAVID CAMERON WAS THE GREAT NEW 
THING THEN HE HAD HIS PROBLEMS 
OVER GRAMMAR SCHOOLS EVERYONE SAID 
HE WAS DOOMED GORDON BROWN STARTED 
OFF WELL AND NOW HE'S IN TROUBLE L. 
SUSPECT WITH TWO YEARS TO GO THERE 
WILL BE FURTHER PENDULUM SWINGS 
BUT WHAT THE LABOUR PARTY HAS TO 
TRY TO DO NOW IS NOT FALL APART 
NOT PANIC IT HAS REASONS TO 
BELIEVE THAT THINGS ARE NOT AS BAD 
AS THEY WERE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IN PARTICULAR 
IT'S THE CASE THAT MOST LABOUR M. P.'S 
WANT TO WIN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
THAT WAS NOT THE CASE WITH 
CONSERVATIVES IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE TOO MANY OF 
THEM WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT 
EUROPE THAN WINNING 
HOW MUCH IS 
GORDON BROWN TO BLAME FOR THIS 
MASSIVE DOWNTURN 
HE WAS ON T. V. ON 
SUNDAY DOING THE HIS PIECE WITH THE 
FAUX ELECTION WHEN THINGS GO WRONG 
IN GOVERNMENT THE PERSONALITY OF 
THE LEADER ONCE AN ASSET BECOME A 
LIABILITY THINGS DIDN'T CARE ABOUT 
JOHN MAJOR BEING DULL IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN 
HE WON FOR THE CONSERVATIVES WHEN 
THINGS WENT WRONG SUDDENLY THAT 
DULLNESS WAS A TERRIBLE PROBLEM FOR 
HIM HE HAS TO FIND A WAY OF 
TURNING WHAT HE IS HIS STRENGTHS 
BACK INTO THINGS WHICH PEOPLE LIKE 
THAT'S NOT WHERE HE IS AT THE 
MOMENT BUT HE STILL HAS GOT THINGS 
PEOPLE LIKE 
DIANE IS GORDON BROWN 
THE NEW JOHN MAJOR OR IS IT EVEN 
WORSE 
NO NOT AT ALL YOU CAN WORSE UP FOR A START 
VIOLENCE BREAKS OUT IN THIS WEEK 
STUDIO 
PART OF GORDON BROWN'S STUDIO PROBLEM IS BITTER AND DISAPPOINTED 
FORMER BLAIRITE MINISTERS WHO 
BECAUSE THEIR CAREERS ARE OVER WANT 
IT TO BE OVER FOR THE LABOUR PARTY 
AS WELL L. THINK WHAT HE NEEDS TO 
DO IS FIRST OF ALL BE HIMSELF THIS 
GOING ROUND LIKE OPRAH WINFREY I I FEEL YOUR PAIN 
I KNOW 
HE DOESN'T 
EVEN KNOW HOW TO SAY IT 
HE JUST 
NEEDS TO BE HIMSELF YOU DON'T HAVE 
TO LIKE A LEADER MRS. THATCHER 
PROVED THAT YOU HAVE TO RESPECT 
HIM THEN HE HAS TO SORT OUT THE 
TEN P. TAX THING SORT IT OUT PROPERLY 
YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING 
MICHAEL YOU WERE ON THE INSIDE TO 
WATCH THE JOHN MAJOR GOVERNMENT 
UNRAVEL DO YOU SEE SIMILARITIES 
NOW WITH THE BROWN GOVERNMENT 
I DO 
SEE SIMILARITIES ALTHOUGH IN TRUTH 
I CAN'T SEE WHY LABOUR HAS COME TO 
SUCH A PASS IT WAS VERY 
EXPUBLICABLE IN THE CASE OF THE 
MAJOR GOVERNMENT WE HAD THIS 
IMMENSE ROW ABOUT EUROPE AND IT 
MATTERED TO MANY OF US MORE THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE LABOUR 
DOESN'T HAVE THAT THING 
AND ALTHOUGH MATTHEW WENT THROUGH 
THE THINGS THAT HAVE GONE WRONG AND 
ALL THOSE WERE RIGHT THE FACT IS 
LABOUR WAS GAINING ON THE 
CONSERVATIVES IN THE OPINION POLLS 
UNTIL THE BUDGET WHICH WAS ONLY 
ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO WHICH IS ONE 
OF THE REASONS PERHAPS WHY LABOUR 
SHOULDN'T PANIC TOO MUCH THE 
PHENOMENON WE'RE SEEING NOW 
ALTHOUGH VERY PRONOUNCED THIS 
MASSIVE CONSERVATIVE LEAD HAS ONLY 
BEEN AROUND FOR A RELATIVELY SHORT 
PERIOD OF TIME YOU SHOULDN'T 
ASSUME ANYTHING UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN 
IT FOR A BIT LONGER BUT THE WAY 
LABOUR IS BEHAVING NOW IS VERY 
REMINISCENT OF THE TORY PROBLEM 
LABOUR M. P.'S ARE PANICKING THINK 
THEY SHOULD PANIC MARGINALLY LESS 
ARE THEY BLAMING HIM 
I THINK 
THAT'S A BIT IRRATIONAL AT LEAST 
THE LEFT WE TRY TO HAVE A 
CHALLENGE PEOPLE ARE WHITERING ON 
ABOUT GORDON BROWN NOT BEING GOOD 
AT PRESENTATION HE WAS ALWAYS NO 
GOOD AT PRESENTATION THEY KNEW 
THAT 
YOU KEEP YOUR EAR TO THE THAT GROUND ARE BACKBENCHERS BLAMING 
HIM PERSONALLY 
I DON'T THINK THEY 
ARE MICHAEL IS RIGHT THE LABOUR 
PARTY IS NOT SPLIT IN THE WAY THE 
CONSERVATIVES WERE YOU'RE WRONG TO 
SAY BLAIRITE MINISTERS EX 
MINISTERS ARE CARPING 
I'M IN 
WESTMINSTER EVERY DAY I SEE THEM 
IN HUDDLES IT'S LIKE WHEN 
HESELTINE RAN FOR LEADERSHIP EVERY 
CORNER YOU TURNED AROUND THERE WAS 
A HUDDLE OF CONSPIRATORS 
TEA ROOMS DOING ROARING BUSINESS 
TRUST ME 
THE SPIRIT OF THE LABOUR 
PARTY IS NOT ONE OF HOSTILITY IT'S 
ONE OF SADNESS THEY FEEL GORDON'S 
PAIN THEY SEE THE DIFFICULTIES 
HE'S HAVING THEY'RE STILL BROADLY 
ARE BY HIM ALTHOUGH DISMAYED BY 
THE TEN P. TAX 
THEY'RE SAYING DAVID CAMERON'S 
WEAKEST MOMENTS HAS BEEN WHEN HE'S 
TRYING TO DEFINE HIMSELF AND THEY 
HOPE THEY CAN HAVE REASONABLE 
PERIOD WITHOUT A COCK UP THE 
PROBLEM 
I WOULD SAY COMPARING 
THIS WITH THE MAJOR PERIOD THE 
BLAME PLACED ON THE PRIME MINISTER 
IS GREATER NOW IF WE GO INTO AN 
ECONOMIC PROBLEM PEOPLE WILL 
CLEAVE TO THE PRIME MINISTER 
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE 
ECONOMICALLY SOUND IN THE PAST L. 
CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER SAID THAT NOW 
SO MUCH THE OPPOSITE IS TURNING OUT 
TO BE THE CASE L. THINK GORDON 
BROWN IS BEING ABSOLUTELY 
IDENTIFIED WITH FAILURE AND 
INCOMPETENCE THE TEN P. TAX THING IS 
THE LATEST EXAMPLE ONE OF THE 
PROBLEMS IS THAT HE'S APPOINTED 
SUCH A WEAK CABINET THAT THERE'S 
NOBODY ELSE TO TAKE THE BLAME 
NOBODY DREAMS OF BLAMING ALISTAIR 
DARLING BECAUSE NOBODY BELIEVES 
ALISTAIR DARLING IS A REAL BRITISH 
IN POLITICS 
MANY MUCH THESE M. P.'S 
HAVE NEVER KNOWN HARD TIMES THEY 
JOINED THE PARTY WHEN BLAIR WAS IN 
OPPOSITION AND ON THE ASCENDSY 
THEY WERE NEVER IN THE PARTIES IN 
THE MID EIGHTIES 
THEY'VE NEVER KNOWN 
HARDSHIP 
THAT'S WHY SOME ARE HARDSHIP PANICKING 
IS HE REALLY SAFE THERE PANICKING MUST COME A POINT WHEN IT GETS SO 
BAD THAT PEOPLE DO SAY OR HAVE YOU 
GOT A COLLECTIVE DEATH WISH YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SEVENTY PEOPLE 
IT'S NOT 
THAT MANY THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED OF YOU I'M I'M PREPARED TO SAY THERE WON'T BE A 
LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE BETWEEN NOW 
AND THE ELECTION 
THE ONLY WAY WILL 
BE A CHANGE IS IF GORDON CAME TO 
THE CONCLUSION HE COULDN'T 
COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRITISH PEOPLE 
I DON'T THINK THE LABOUR PARTY 
WOULD CHALLENGE HIM PARTLY BECAUSE 
THE BRITISH ELECTORATE TO SAY TO GO 
THROUGH THIS TWICE WOULD BE 
UNACCEPTABLE AND THE NEW LEADER 
WOULD LACK LEGITIMACY 
NO ONE WOULD 
COME FORWARD DO YOU THINK FIGURES FIGURES ON THE HARD LEFT MIGHT DO 
NO I 
DON'T WANT TO CALL CHARLES CLARKE'S 
NAME IN VAIN BUT 
BUT YOU'RE 
ABOUT TO 
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT 
WOULD LOVE TO COME FORWARD THE 
FACT IS I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WILL 
BE A SERIOUS LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE 
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE NO MATTER HOW 
BAD IT GETS THAT GORDON BROWN WILL 
VOLUNTARILY DISPATCH HIMSELF YOU YOU DON'T WAIT ALL YOUR LIFE TO BE 
PRIME MINISTER AND WALK AWAY 
HE'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT WE'RE 
NOT GOING TO CHALLENGE HIM 
I AGREE 
WITH MY FRIEND 
IS THAT ALL YOU 
WANTED TO SAY 
IT'S ALL I'M ALLOWED 
TO SAY L. CAN'T IMAGINE GORDON 
BROWN WALKING AWAY FOR A MINUTE DO DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE MOOD IS 
AROUND MR. BROWN AT THE MOMENT IS 
HE BUNKERED DOWN WITH ONE OR TWO OF 
HIS CLOSEST ADVISERS IS HE 
REACHING OUT BEYOND THEM WHAT IS 
HIS OWN PERSONAL MOOD IS HE UPSET 
IN DESPAIR OR DEFIANT WHATEVER WHATEVER HAPPENS IN ANY ORGANISATION WHEN IT 
HITS HARD TIMES THERE'LL BE SOME 
PEOPLE WHO TURN OUT TO BE PEOPLE 
WHO CAN COPE WITH THAT AND THEY 
WILL ACTUALLY GAIN POWER AND 
THERE'LL BE OTHERS WHO CRUMBLE 
UNDER THE PRESSURE THAT'S WHY THE 
ADVICE I WOULD GIVE IS THEY NEED TO 
REMEMBER THEY'VE STILL GOT TWO 
YEARS EVEN IF THEY'RE GOING TO 
LOSE IN TWO YEARS THERE ARE A LOT 
OF THINGS THEY CAN CAN ACHIEVE IN 
TWO YEARS THE LABOUR PARTY NEED TO 
STOP LOOKING AT OPINION POLLS 
THINK WHAT THEY CAN DELIVER IN THE 
TWO YEARS AND IF POSSIBLE GIVE 
LABOUR M. P.'S A ROLE THEMSELVES IN 
DELIVERING THAT 
YOU USED TO ADVISE 
TONY BLAIR AND GIVEN GORDON BROWN 
BUT THIS EVENING YOU'RE OFFERING 
ADVICE ON A LATE NIGHT TELEVISION 
SHOW WITH A MEGAPHONE WHY AREN'T 
YOU THERE ADVISING ANYMORE I I HAVEN'T GIVEN ADVICE TO TONY BLAIR 
AND I GAVE ADVICE TO TONY BLAIR 
SOME TIME AGO 
YOU WEREN'T THERE 
THERE WITH GORDON BROWN THINKING 
THROUGH OPTIONS 
NO THE 
I THINK 
WE CAN SAY HE WASN'T THERE 
DO YOU 
THINK HE WOULD LISTEN TO THE KIND 
OF ADVICE THAT PEOPLE LIKE MATTHEW 
AND OTHERS WOULD GIVE HIM GORDON GORDON IS A GOD AMONGST MEN BUT HE'S NOT 
VERY GOOD AT LISTENING TO PEOPLE I I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE ACTUALLY 
I THINK HE'S LISTENING TO AN AWFUL 
LOT OF PEOPLE 
HE'S NOT LIST TONING 
FORMER BLAIRITES WHICH RULES YOU 
OUT BUT HE IS LISTENING TO PEOPLE 
BUT AT THE GETTING THE RIGHT ADVICE WHEN HE'S TOLD TO GO ON TO 
THE ANDREW MARR SHOW AND SAY I 
FEEL YOUR PAIN 
NO HE'S NOT ROY ROY HATTERSLEY'S LINE IS LET GORDON BE 
GORDON 
I THINK THIS IS THE PROBLEM GORDON THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S AN ATTEMPT 
TO CONSTANTLY WIN THE BATTLE OF THE 
NEXT COUPLE MUCH DAYS' HEADLINES 
AND THEY'VE GOT TO STOP DOING THAT 
THEY'VE GOT TO RECOGNISE THEY'RE IN 
DIFFICULTY TRY TO AVOID MAKING 
MISTAKES HOPE THE ATTENTION TURNS 
TO DAVID CAMERON AND TRY TO PLAY A 
LONGER GAME THIS ATTEMPT TO USE A 
DIFFERENT TACTIC EVERY COUPLE OF 
DAYS IT APPEARS TO BE TRANSPARENT 
AND IT BACKFIRES 
FOR WEND THE 
WENDY ALEXANDER MOMENT THIS WEEK IS 
A DEMONSTRATION THAT YOU CANNOT 
OVERSTATE THE POSSIBILITY OF 
INCOMPETENCE UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT 
WE'RE GOING TO COME ON TO THAT I I BET WE ARE 
THAT WAS ACTUALLY A 
REDUNDANT POINT 
AS USUAL 
NOW YOU 
SEE DIFFICULTIES I HAVE MATTHEW A A PLEASURE AS ALWAYS 
DON'T GO TO BED 
PLEASE WE'RE NOT COMING UP WE'VE 
GOT THE ONE AND ONLY BRUCE FORSYTH 
I'M NOT HAVING YOU ON THE GREAT 
MAN WILL BE HERE BUT YOU'LL HAVE 
TO WAIT A WEEK NEXT WEEK FOR 
BRUCIE TONIGHT WE HAVE ANOTHER 
STAR THE OSCAR NOMINATED FILM 
MAKER MORGAN SPURLOCK WHO WILL 
TALK TO US ABOUT ADDICTIONS 
TIME TO CRACK OPEN ANOTHER BOTTLE 
OF BLUE NUN AND SAVIOUR THE MOMENT 
FOR THIS HAS BEEN A POLITICAL WEEK 
FOR CONSOURCE WHO SO 
CONNOISSEURS WHO WHO BETTER THAN 
TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH THAN KEVIN 
MAGUIRE WITH HIS ROUND UP OF THE 
WEEK THERE'S SOME FLASH 
PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE FILM WHEN WILL I BE FAMOUS 
FOR CIVILIANS LIKE ME IT'S HARD TO 
IMAGINE LIFE IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
UNTIL NOW THAT IS A FIRM IS 
OFFERING ANYONE EVEN ANDREW NEILL 
A SL EB YOU LIKE SERVICE ONE CHAP 
WHO WON'T HAVE TO PAY IS MR. MEYER 
THE NEW HECRANIAN TIGER OF OLD 
LONDON TOWN 
I KNOW THERE WILL BE 
MANY WHOSE PENCILS HOVERED FOR AN 
INSTANT BEFORE PUTTING AN X. IN MY 
BOX I WILL WORK FLAT OUT TO REPAY 
AND TO JUSTIFY YOUR CONFIDENCE 
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE KEN LIVINGSTONE 
TURN TO DRINK A CHAP WHO DELIVERED 
THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT CONSERVATIVE 
ELECTION VICTORY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO IS HAVE 
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU BORIS JOHNSON 
BOJO TICKS ALL THE BOXES TO BE 
BEATEN BY DAVID CAMERON'S CHUM WAS 
A NASTY KICK IN THE BALLOTS FOR 
LABOUR'S BASH STREET KIDS WHY CAN 
DE WIN HIS MINDERS KEPT HIM IN 
BUBBLE WRAP 
GORDON BROWN'S SELLING POINT IS 
SUBSTANCE NOT STYLE SO WHAT DOES 
IT TELL US WHEN THE GOVERNING PARTY 
SUFFERED ITS WORST DEFEAT SINCE THE 
PRIME MINISTER WAS IN IN SHORT 
TROUSERS THE CULL OF COUNCILLORS 
ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES IN THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS SHOWED BORIS 
JOHNSON ISN'T GORDON'S ONLY PROBLEM 
I CAN MYSELF IT'S REFLECTING 
PEOPLE'S WORRIES ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
PEOPLE'S SENSE THAT WE'VE MADE 
MISTAKES ABOUT THE TEN P. RATE ANY ANY OTHER MISTAKES 
I THINK IF I WAS TO 
BE LOOK BACK ON THE LAST YEAR I 
MEAN I LET SPECULATION ABOUT THE 
GENERAL ELECTION BUILD UP TOO LONG 
PERHAPS I'VE SPENT TOO LITTLE TIME 
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET OUR 
ARMS ACROSS TO THE PUBLIC AND NOW 
OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE SAYING LOOKS 
CAN YOU SHOW US THAT YOU CAN COME 
THROUGH THESE SITUATIONS 
WHAT A 
LOT OF VOICE HE'S GETTING FROM THE 
COMRADES COMRADES THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS OVER THE 
WATER POPPED THROUGH THE CHANNEL 
TUNNEL TO OFFER HIS TWO EUROS WORTH 
IT'S A MISTAKE BECAUSE IT VIOLATED 
THAT KEY TENET OF NEW LABOUR WHICH 
IS THAT WE LOOK AFTER THE POOR AND 
NEEDY IN SOCIETY IT GOES ALONG 
AROUND WITH THE OTHER KEY 
COMPONENTS OF NEW LABOUR HOLE IF 
LOSE ONE SECTION ONE TENET THAT 
THE WHOLE EDIFICE STARTS LOOKING 
SHAKY AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED 
JUST AS GORDON BROWN MUST HAVE 
THOUGHT IT COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE 
UP POPS WENDY ALEXANDER TO CLAIM 
HER OWN FIFTEEN MINUTES OF FAME OR 
MERELY INFAMILIARY SHE ISSUED 
BRAVEHEART BRING IT ON SO SHE COULD 
VOTE NO IT WAS A GIFT NOR THE 
NATIONALISTS 
AS THE NATIONAL NATIONALISTS CONVERSATION PROCEEDS WITH THE 
DECLARED COMMITTED SUPPORT OF EVERY 
LABOUR M. S. P. THEN WE'LL BRING 
FORWARD THE LEGISLATION AND WILL 
GO INTO THE REFERENDUM AND SCOTLAND 
WILL VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE AND 
FREEDOM IN 
BROWN'S NOT A HAPPY 
PREMIER HIS AUTHORITY'S TAKEN A 
BATTERING BATTERING A LABOUR REGIME IS FREAKISHLY OUT 
OF CONTROL AS ILL DISCIPLINED AS A 
RAMPAGE IN OXFORD OR MAYBE CREWE 
WILL YOU REDUCE THE TWENTY PER CENT BACK TO TEN PER CENT 
FOR THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY IT 
THAT'S ONE QUESTION 
I CAN'T 
PROMISE THAT BUT WE CAN STOP THE 
GOVERNMENT IN THEIR THEIR TRACKS 
WOULD YOU GIVE US THAT TEN PER CENT BACK IF 
YOU'RE ELECTED AS PRIME MINISTER THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT 
ANSWER THE QUESTION DAVE 
CAMERON'S LACK OF AN ANSWER ON TEN P. 
ISN'T STOPPING THEM ASKING OTHER 
QUESTIONS PUTTING THE PUNCH INTO 
PUNCH ANDUDEY POLITICS 
IF HE HAD A 
COHERENT VISION WOULDN'T PEOPLE 
HAVE HEARD IT BY NOW SHOULDN'T 
EVERYONE CONCLUDE THAT WE'VE GOT IS 
A GOVERNMENT THAT LURCHES FROM ONE 
RELAUNCH TO ANOTHER AND SHOULDN'T 
THEY CONCLUDE WHAT'S MISSING IS 
WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED AND THAT IS A 
CLEAR VISION AND SOME STRONG 
LEADERSHIP FOR BRITAIN 
IF HE 
LOOKING AT WHAT THE CONSERVATIVE 
PROMISES ARE RISK TO THE ECONOMY 
BACK TO THE SITUATION WE HAD IN THE 
EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES AND NO AMOUNT OF SLICK 
SAILSMANSHIP CAN OBSCURE THE FACT 
THAT THERE IS NO SUBSTANCE IN 
EVERYTHING THE I CONSERVATIVES SAY 
THE LITTLE LAD STUCK IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE BIG BOYS WANTS TO BE HEARD 
TOO 
I THINK EVERYBODY NOW KNOWS TOO THAT WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING THE 
MOST NEEDY HE HAS GOT NO 
PRINCIPLES AND THE TORIES HAVE GOT 
NO POLICIES 
WHEN WILL I BE FAMOUS 
NOT EVERY POLITICIAN CAN OR SHOULD 
BE A MEDIA SUPERSTAR BUT BROWN 
NEEDS TO DO BETTER AND HE KNOWS IT 
HE NEEDS TO SHOW MORE OF WHAT IS 
CALLED EMOTIONAL LITERACY SOME 
THINK HE COULD LEARN A TRICK OR TWO 
FROM BORIS CRIKEY 
WHO WAS THAT ANYWAY 
I DON'T KNOW 
YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE OF THE 
INTERVIEW WITH PETER MANDELSON ON 
HARDTALK TOMORROW NIGHT ON THE B. B. C. 
NEWS CHANNEL 
ENOUGH OF THAT MICHAEL DID YOUR 
PEN HOVER WHEN YOU CAME TO VOTE 
HOVER NO 
WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR 
MICHAEL 
I DON'T HAVE TO DECLARE MY MICHAEL VOTE 
OBVIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T VOTE VOTE FOR BORIS 
I THOUGHT BORIS'S 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN WAS AN INSULT TO 
MY INTELLIGENCE REALLY 
YOU DIDN'T 
VOTE FOR HIM 
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY 
I DIDN'T 
YOU COULD HARDLY VOTE FOR 
SOMEBODY WHO IS AN INSULT TO YOUR 
INTELLIGENCE 
YOU MAY DEDUCE THAT INTELLIGENCE WAS IT GORDON BROWN'S FAULT THAT MR. 
LIVINGSTON LOST LONDON 
WELL I 
MEAN THE COLLAPSE OF THE LABOUR 
VOTE THE 
THE ELECTION WAS FOUGHT 
AT THE TIME WHEN THE NATIONAL POLLS 
WERE STRONGLY AGAINST THE 
GOVERNMENT 
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR GOVERNMENT KEN TO MAKE UP THAT GAP HE WAS TWENTY 
POINTS AHEAD OF LABOUR NATIONALLY 
HOWEVER MICHAEL TALKS ABOUT 
BORIS'S CAMPAIGN ONE OF THE THINGS 
THE TORY DID WAS IN TERMS OF 
ORGANISATIONALLY THEY WENT TO THE 
BOROUGHS THEY GO THAT'S WHAT 
MADE THE DIFFERENCE 
WILL BORIS BE ANY GOOD AS MAYOR HE HE MIGHT BE YOU'RE PROBABLY THE BEST 
PERSON TO ANSWER THIS BECAUSE YOU 
KNOW WHAT WENT ON AT THE SPECTATOR 
WHEN HE WAS THERE IT WAS A PRETTY 
GOOD MAGAZINE CAME OUT EVERY WEEK 
AND HAD GOOD CONTRIBUTORS AND SO ON 
SO IT IS OBVIOUSLY POSSIBLE FOR 
BORIS 
HE ISN'T GOING TO RUN 
LONDON CENTRAL TORY CENTRAL 
OFFICE WILL RUN LONDON THEY'VE GOT 
NICK BOWLS IN THERE FOR THE TIME 
BEING THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE 
BORIS RUN LONDON 
BECAUSE IT 
BECOMES A BIT OF A TEST CASE FOR 
THE TORIES 
INDEED IT DOES BORIS 
IS NOW EASILY THE MOST POWERFUL 
TORY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
YOU SOUND SO BIRTH 
MICHAEL BITTER MICHAEL THERE THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS HERE ONE IS WHAT 
DOES IT LOOK LIKE FOR THE TORIES 
THAT BORIS IS RUNNING LONDON AS I 
SAY IT MAY WORK OUT RIGHT BUT THE 
OTHER BIG ISSUE IS FOR THE TIME 
BEING BORIS IS A PERSON WITH REAL 
POLITICAL POWER AND DAVID CAMERON 
IS NOT HE'S ONLY LEADER OF THE 
OPPOSITION AND YOU'RE ASSUMING 
THAT THE TORY PARTY WILL KEEP BORIS 
UNDER CONTROL 
THEY'LL HAVE TO 
SINCE BORIS HAS POLITICAL POWER AND 
THE REST OF THEM DON'T YOU CAN'T 
ENTIRELY ASSUME IT'S GOING TO BE 
THAT WAY ROUND 
HOW BORIS RUNS 
CLINTON IS A FACTOR IN THE RUN UP 
TO THE ELECTION CERTAINLY AND CERTAINLY AND BORIS IS I THINK FOR MANY PEOPLE 
AT LEAST AS WELL KNOWN AS THE 
PUBLIC FACE OF THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY AS DAVID CAMERON IS YES HE'S YES HE'S A HOUSEHOLD NAME HE'S CALLED BORIS 
MR. CAMERON IS NOT CALLED DAVID NOT NOT LEAST BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY 
DAVID'S 
THIS BUSINESS IN SCOTLAND WITH WEE 
WENDY AND BIG GORDY THIS SHOWS 
THAT GORDON BROWN HAS NOW LOST HIS 
GRIP EVEN IN HIS OWN BACK YARD 
THE S. N. P. WERE COCKA HOOP IN 
WESTMINSTER I THINK SHE'S SUPPOSED 
TO BE PERSONALLY CLOSE TO GORDON 
SO INEXPLICABLE WHY SHE SHOULD MAKE 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT WITHOUT TELLING 
HIM 
BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN TRYING TO HIM GO DOWN THIS ROAD FOR MONTHS AND 
MONTHS HE SAID HE COULD BE 
CONVINCED BUT WASN'T THAT SURE IN 
THE END SHE GOT FED UP WITH THE 
DITHERING AND DECIDED TO DO IT IF IF WEE WENDY IS BREAKING LOOSE WELL 
IT DOES MEAN HE'S LOSING HIS 
AUTHORITY DOESN'T IT 
OF COURSE 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY ASSUMED HE CAN'T 
AFFORD TO LOSE HER ONCE YOU START 
LOSING LABOUR LEADERS THEN YOU SAY 
WHO'S THE NEXT TO GO 
HE ALSO ENDS 
UP TALKING NONSENSE IN THE COMMONS 
YES 
HE DOESN'T SAY I DON'T AGREE YES WITH WENDY ALEXANDER OR I DO HE 
SAID SHE DIDN'T SAY THAT OF COURSE 
ON DAILY POLITICS WE IMMEDIATELY 
RAN THE TAPE THAT SAID HE DID IF 
YOU LIE YOU USUALLY DO IT IN A WAY 
THAT PEOPLE WON'T RUMBLE YOU THAT THAT WAS ODD 
MAYBE WENDY ALEXANDER IS 
RIGHT MAYBE IF UP BELIEVE IN THE 
UNION YOU SHOULD HAVE THE 
REFERENDUM NOW IT'S TRUE IS IT 
NOT THAT EVEN UNDER A GORDON BROWN 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT YOU'RE MORE THAN 
LIKELY TO WIN A UNIONIST REFERENDUM 
THAN UNDER A TORY GOVERNMENT WHICH 
WILL HAVE ALMOST TWO SEATS IN 
SCOTLAND 
SHE MAY BE RIGHT IN THAT SCOTLAND RESPECT BUT REMEMBER LABOUR IS 
VERY VERY WEAK IN SCOTLAND AT THE 
MOMENT WENDY ALEXANDER HAS 
TERRIBLE POLL RATINGS IN SCOTLAND 
HER OWN JOB HAS BEEN HANGING BY THE 
THINEST OF THREADS 
SO ACTUALLY IF THERE WERE A 
REFERENDUM TODAY I WOULD NOT 
ASSUME THAT LABOUR IS GOING TO COME 
OUT OF IT VERY WELL THEY ARE IN A 
HOPELESS POSITION IN SCOTLAND BUT BUT THE S. N. P. DON'T WANT A REFERENDUM NOW 
THEY 
THEY WANT TO WAIT FOR A TORY THEY GOVERNMENT AND THEY CAN SAY YOU'RE 
BEING RULED BY A TORY GOVERNMENT 
THERE ARE ONLY TWO TORY M. P.'S IF THAT 
THERE AND AND THEY THINK THEY'LL 
HAVE A BETTER CHANCE 
GIVEN THAT 
THE S. N. P. POSITION THAT THEY'LL HOLD 
IT IN THREE YEARS' TIME WHAT WAS 
LABOUR TRYING TO PRETEND THAT IT 
COULD FORCE THE PACE LABOUR HAS 
BEEN VOTED OUT IN SCOTLAND IT IS 
NOT THE GOVERNMENT IN SCOTLAND FOR 
WENDY ALEXANDER TO GO AROUND 
PRETENDING LABOUR CALLS THE SHOTS 
IS INSENSITIVITY 
THERE'S A 
PERFECTLY RESPECTABLE CASE FOR 
SAYING BRING IT ON AND HAVE THE 
REFERENDUM NOW THE PROBLEM HAS 
BEEN THAT BECAUSE BROWN AND 
ALEXANDER DIDN'T SQUARE EACH OTHER 
THAT THE STORY NOT CALLING A 
REFERENDUM NOW THE STORY IS THE 
BATTLE AT THE TOP OF THE LABOUR 
PARTY 
YEAH UNFORTUNATELY 
YOU SAW PARTY ALEX SALMOND THERE IN SCOTLAND YOU 
COMPARE SALMOND'S CONFIDENCE WITH 
GORDON BROWN'S CONDITION IT'S ALL 
TO SALMOND'S ADVANTAGE 
I THOUGHT 
IT WAS A WONDERFUL CLIP HE'S 
OBVIOUSLY HAVING THE TIME OF HIS 
LIFE LIFE AND GAINING IN THE OPINION POLLS 
ALL THE TIMECREWE BY ELECTION BY ELECTION COMING UP IT WILL BE ON THE NIGHT 
WE ARE ON AIR SCHEDULEERS WE ARE 
ON AIR WILL LABOUR LOSE CREWE 
DIANE 
IT'S POSSIBLE IF GORDON CAN DIANE SORT OUT THE TEN P. THING WE HAVE A 
DECENT CHANCE 
OF JUST HOEDING TO 
IT 
GWYNETH WAS POPULAR UP THERE IT SHE WAS FROM WALES 
THE NAME 
STKPWHRM DO YOU THINK IT'S A 
DYNASTY IT DOES WORK NOT FOR 
HILLARY CLINTON THANK GOD ONE I SUPPOSE WE'RE ALL AGREED THAT 
GORDON BROWN SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM 
CREWE 
YEAH IT'S A GOOD RULE UNDER CREWE THE TORIES THAT THE PRIME MINISTER 
NEVER WENT THERE 
WHEREVER HE GOES THEY SEEM TO LOSE 
VERY BRIEFLY THE MOOD OF THE 
TORIES AT THE MOMENT 
I THINK 
ABSOLUTELY ECSTATIC IN MY VIEW 
POSSIBLY EXCESSIVELY ECSTATIC IN AS 
MUCH AS THIS PHENOMENON OF BEING SO 
FAR AHEAD COULD BE SHORT LIVED BUT 
THOSE RESULTS THE OTHER DAY WAS 
STUNNING IT TRUE ON ELECTION STUNNING NIGHT YOU SAID FORTY FOUR PER CENT WASN'T A VERY 
GOOD RESULT 
NO I SAID FORTY FOUR WAS NOT 
EXCEPTIONAL FOR AN OPPOSITION PARTY 
THERE HAVE BEEN OPPOSITION PARTIES 
FURTHER AHEAD 
A LOT OF TORIES WERE 
UPSET BY WHAT YOU SAID 
I DON'T 
WORK FOR THE TORY PARTY 
YOU'RE NOT 
BOTHERED 
WHAT I SAID 
WAS EXCEPTION BOTHERED WAS LABOUR AT TWENTY FOUR THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARY WE HAVE TO MOVE ON BECAUSE WE KNOW 
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE ADDICTION PROBLEM 
THERE'S NO NEED TO DENY IT WE KNOW 
O. K. YOU MIGHT NOT BE IN THE AMY 
WINEHOUSE OR PETE DOHERTY SCALE 
BUT ADMIT IT YOU WOULDN'T BE UP 
THIS LATE WATCHING THIS STUFF IF 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE PROBLEM 
SO IN THE WEEK WHEN THE HOME 
SECRETARY JACQUI SMITH DECIDED TO 
RECLASSIFY CANNABIS FROM CLASS C. TO 
B. WE THOUGHT WE'D PUT ADDICTION IN 
THE SPOTLIGHT WHO BETTER TO TELL 
US THAN MORGAN SPURLOCK WHO ATE 
NOTHING BUT MCDONALD HAMBURGERS FOR 
A MONTH 
OH HEY I'M A MAN OF FEW VICES I 
HEAR YOU BRITS GORGE ON OVER EIGHT 
MILLION CALORIES JUST IN SNACKS IN 
THE COURSE OF YOUR LIFETIME 
BELIEVE ME WEE AMERICANS AREN'T 
MUCH BETTER THE LEAST THAT'S 
WHAT I FOUND OUT IN MY ACADEMY 
NOMINATED FILM SUPERVISE ME 
A LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN 
IT'S NOT JUST FOOD DESPITE THE 
WARNINGS MANY OF US AND I MEAN 
YOU ARE STILL ADDICTED TO THINGS 
WE KNOW ARE BAD FOR US CIGARETTES 
CAFFEINE ALCOHOL 
NO WATER PLEASE WHAT ABOUT 
GAMBLING SHOPPING

SOME SAY SEX ADDICTION IS ON THE 
RISE RISE BUT HOW DID WE GET THIS WAY WHY 
ARE SO MANY OF US ADDICTED TO SO 
MANY THINGS IS IT BECAUSE WE ARE 
ADDICTED TO WORK DOES THAT DRIVE 
US TO OTHER ADDICTIONS TO UNWIND 
NOT ALL ADDICTIONS ARE BAD AFTER 
ALL

SOFA WITH AND DIANE

WELCOME TO OUR SHOW 
THANKS FOR

A TYPE OF DONUT KATEING IS THAT IT 
IT'S ONE OF THEM 
ANOTHER ONE MICHAEL BLACKBERRYS BLACKBERRYS COMPUTERS COMPUTERS REALLY DULL ADDICTIONS 
DULL PEOPLE 
ARE WE ALL BECOMING MORE ADDICTIVE 
WHAT I SAID AT THE END I'M A 
WORKAHOLIC I WORK CONSTANTLY L. L. 
THINK YOU NEED THINGS TO TAKE THE 
EDGE OFF WHEN YOU'RE DONE FOR ME A 
COUPLE OF PINTS OF GUINNESS WORK 
WONDERS I THINK WE FIND THINGS 
THAT HELP US LOSE THAT A LITTLE 
BIT YOU 
KNOW THIS COUNTRY YOU'RE BITYOU FROM AMERICA ARE AMERICANS MORE 
ADDICTIVE OR IS IT REALLY BECOMING 
A PROBLEM COMMON TO THE WEST I I THINK IT'S ANYWHERE WHERE MODERN 
TECHNOLOGY HAS TAKEN OVER JUST 
LIKE MICHAEL SAID HE'S ADDICTED TO 
HIS BLACKBERRY I'M ON IT 
CONSTANTLY I JUST HUNG UP FROM MY 
CELL PHONE AND NOW I'M ON THE 
BLACKBERRY DO WE NEED TO 
COMMUNICATE THAT DESPERATELY THAT 
WE NEED TO BE ON IT IMMEDIATELY 
TEN YEARS AGO YOU DIDN'T DO 
ANYTHING 
I KNOW AND IT WASN'T A ANYTHING PROBLEM 
THAT'S THE THING YOU PROBLEM DIDN'T MENTION IT'S AVAILABILITY 
EVERYTHING IS MUCH MORE AVAILABLE 
FOOD IS MUCH CHEAPER ALCOHOL IS 
MUCH CHEAPER BLACKBERRYS ARE 
LIBERAL WE HAVE LIBERAL SEXUAL 
MORAYS 
YOU MAY 
SOCIETY DOES MORAYS SO IT'S COMBINATION OF STRESS 
THAT MAKES US THAT PLUS THE FACT 
THAT ADDICTIONS ARE NOW MORE 
AVAILABLE THAN THEY PROBABLY EVER 
HAVE BEEN BEFORE 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS THAT THEY'RE NOT SHUNED UPON 
OR FROUND UPON IT'S LIKE GREAT 
OF COURSE YOU'RE ON YOUR BLACKBERRY 
AND SMOKE A LOT OF COURSE YOU 
DRINK A LOT TO DEAL WITH WORK 
IT'S FINE 
YOU DID THIS FAMOUS DOCUMENTARY 
YOU SPENT A MONTH EATING BIG MACS 
THE BIG BIG MAC 
YEAH ALL KINDS OF JUNK FOOD FROM 
MCDONALD'S WHEN YOU WERE DOING 
THAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE GETTING 
ADDICTED TO THIS WHAT YOU DON'T 
SEE AT THE END OF THE FILM WHEN I 
FINISH SHOOTING THE MOVIE AND I 
WENT OFF THE FOOD IT WAS ALMOST 
LIKE DRUGS L. WENT THROUGH MASSIVE 
WITHDRAWAL OVER A PERIOD OF THREE 
DAYS DURING THE FILM I WAS GETTING 
HEADACHES WHILE WE WERE MAKING THE 
FILM AND I WOULD EAT THE FOOD AND 
THE HEADACHES WOULD GO AWAY BY DAY 
THREE I WAS CURLED UP IN A BALL IN 
THE COUCH SHAKING IT WAS 
INCREDIBLE 
YOU MADE YOU IMPOTENT INCREDIBLE THEY DID 
I SAW THE MOVIE LOVED IT 
ARE ALL ADDICTIONS BAD 
WELL I IT SUPPOSE IF YOU'RE GORDON BROWN IS 
KIND OF ADDICTED TO MORAL RECTITUDE 
WHICH IS A GOOD THING TO BE 
ADDICTED TO IF YOU CAN STICK WITH 
IT 
YES BUT NOT IF IT LEADS TO YOU IT TAKING BAD DECISIONS MICHAEL SOME 
ADDICTIONS MAY BE A GOOD THING I I CAN'T THINK OF ANY L. THINK 
ADDICTIONS MEANS A LACK OF 
MODERATION AND A LACK OF BALANCE M. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK MORGAN 
I DON'T 
KNOW IF YOU COULD BE ADDICTED TO 
READING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE 
ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS BUT MOST 
ADDICTIONS MOST OF THE THINGS 
WE'RE ADDICTED TO AREN'T THAT GREAT 
FOR US THAT'S AT THE END OF THE 
DAY 
EVEN THINGS GOOD FOR US IF DAY YOU DO BECOME ADDICTED TO THEM 
LIKE EXERCISE ADDICTS 
PEOPLE ARE 
ADDICTED TO THAT AND THEY GO BRAIN 
DEAD 
BRAIN DEAD YOU BECOME DEAD COMPLETELY JUST IT'S ALMOST LIKE 
IT RUNS YOUR LIFE AT A POINT ONES IS ADDICTION A MATTER NOW FOR US AS 
INDIVIDUALS OR DOES GOVERNMENT 
EITHER NATIONAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
DOES IT HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY I'M I'M NOT A BIG BELIEVER THAT GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN AND 
CAN'T DO L. THINK THAT'S THE LAST 
THING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IF 
YOU'RE IN A SITUATION LIKE IN THE 
STATES THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING 
IN AMERICA THAT IS HAPPENING HERE 
YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES 
YOU HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE L. THINK 
THAT'S GREAT IF I DON'T SMOKE I 
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE NEXT TO YOU 
PUFFING IN MY FACE L. DON'T THINK 
THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT I THINK 
SAYING YOU CAN'T SMOKE AT ALL IS A 
PROBLEM 
SOMETIMES GOVERNMENTS WANT PROBLEM TO GO THAT FURTHER BIT 
IT'S ALMOST 
LIKE WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR 
ALL OF YOU BY DOING THIS BUT IF 
YOU START LOSING FREEDOMS WHAT NEXT 
THE TWO BIG ADDICTIONS OF THIS 
COUNTRY MAYBE THREE NOW WITH 
OBESITY BEING THE THIRD BUT DRUGS 
AND ALCOHOL GOVERNMENT HAS A HUGE 
ROLE TO PLAY 
IT DOES HAVE A ROLE 
OUR RECENT GOING BACKWARDS AND 
FORWARDS ON CANNABIS IS NOT 
IMPRESSIVE 
BECAUSE IT'S LEFT IMPRESSIVE PEOPLE CONFUSED 
YES AND IT'S MORE 
ABOUT PRESENTATION 
THE MEDICAL EXPERTS SAID DON'T 
RECLASSIFY 
JUST LEAVE IT AS IT IS RECLASSIFY BUT THE DAILY MAIL WANTS IT 
RECLASSIFIED 
YES AND WHAT THE RECLASSIFIED EDITOR OF THE DAILY MAIL WANTS HE 
GETS GETS SO YOU THINK IT WAS WRONG TO RE 
RECLASSIFY IT WAS RECLASSIFIED 
FROM A B. TO A C. MAKING SOFTER 
DRUG BUT STILL TOUGH NOW 
CLASSIFIED BACK AGAIN FROM C. TO B. 
WRONG BECAUSE OF THE CONFUSION 
I'M CONFUSED L. THOUGHT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAD DECIDED TO LEAVE IT 
IN THE TOUGHER CATEGORY ISN'T THAT 
WHAT THEY'VE DECIDED THEY'VE 
DECIDED TO IGNORE THE MEDICAL 
ADVICE WHICH WAS TO MAKE IT 
SOFTER CATEGORY 
NO IT HAD GONE TO A SOFTER 
CATEGORY 
IF YOU'RE CONFUSED IF CATEGORY IF IT'S IN THE HARDER CATEGORY JUST 
LEAVE IT THERE AND LET IT STAY 
YOU HAVE A NEW FILM 
I DO IT OPENS 
TOMORROW WHERE IN THE WORLD IS 
OSAMA BIN LADEN
