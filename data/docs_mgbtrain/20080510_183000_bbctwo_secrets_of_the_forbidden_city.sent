THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
THE LARGEST PALACE ON EARTH IN THE HEART OF BEIJING 
TO THE EMPERORS OF CHINA THIS WAS THE CENTRE OF THE WORLD 
ON NEW YEAR'S DAY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY ONE 
THIS ARCHITECTURAL WONDER WAS UNVEILED IN A GRAND OPENING CEREMONY 
BY THE GREAT MING EMPEROR YONGLE 
IT'S VERY HARD TO WALK THROUGH THE MAIN GATE 
WITHOUT BEING IN UTTER AWE OF THAT MAN 
SET ON ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ACRES AND WITH NINE THOUSAND ROOMS 
THE FORBIDDEN CITY HAILED ITS CREATOR THE EMPEROR YONGLE 
AS THE SUPREME RULER OF ALL CHINA 
HE FORGED HIS GREAT VISION FROM TIMBERS 
FELLED THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM BEIJING 
AND GIANT SLABS OF MARBLE HAULED ACROSS ICE 
THE EMPEROR MARSHALLED A MILLION PEOPLE TO BUILD A PALACE 
THAT WOULD LAST A MILLION GENERATIONS 
WE PAID HOMAGE TO HIS MAJESTY 
THE ONE TRUE SON 
OF HEAVEN 
BUT YONGLE HAD NO RIGHT TO CALL HIMSELF EMPEROR 
NO RIGHT TO BUILD A PALACE OF HIS OWN 
IT WAS RAISED ON THE BLOOD OF OTHERS 
THIS WAR LORD HAD CLAWED HIS WAY TO THE TOP 
FOUGHT FOUL 
BETRAYED HIS OWN FAMILY 
KILLED ALL IN HIS PATH TO STEAL THE THRONE 
EVERYTHING TO PROVE THAT HE WAS HEAVEN'S CHOSEN AGENT ON EARTH 
BUT NOW AS THE WORLD'S EYES TURN TO BEIJING 
LONG FORGOTTEN CHRONICLES FROM THE MING ERA 
HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THEY TELL HOW HE CONSTRUCTED A GILDED PRISON 
STOCKED WITH EXOTIC CONCUBINES POLICED BY EUNUCHS 
AND RIFE WITH GREED TREACHERY AND DANGER 
YOUR ONLY DUTY IS TO LOVE ME 
BUT THIS CLOSETED WORLD WOULD BE SHAKEN BY A MURDER SO MONSTROUS 
THAT IT PROVOKED THE VENGEANCE OF HEAVEN 
HAS MY RULE GONE ASTRAY 
HAS MY RULE GONE ASTRAY 
HAS MY RULE GONE ASTRAY 
THIS CRIMSON PALACE THE HEART OF BEIJING 
HAS HIDDEN ITS DARK SECRETS FOR FAR TOO LONG 
IT IS SEPTEMBER ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR 
AND THE FORBIDDEN CITY IS SHROUDED IN DARKNESS 
THE ENTIRE COURT IS IN MOURNING 
THE EMPEROR YONGLE IS DEAD 
IN A DIMLY LIT HALL THE EMPEROR'S MOST TRUSTED SERVANT 
THE EUNUCH HAI SHOU 
HAS COME TO DRESS HIS MASTER IN HIS FUNEREAL ROBES 
TOMORROW AT FIRST LIGHT 
THE BODY WILL BE INTERRED IN THE GREAT MING TOMBS OUTSIDE THE CITY 
TUCKED AWAY IN THE OPULENT QUARTERS OF THE IMPERIAL HAREM 
IS ONE OF THE EXQUISITE WOMEN WHO WARMED THE EMPEROR'S BED 
THE CONCUBINE LADY CUI 
SHE IS MAKING HERSELF BEAUTIFUL FOR HER HUSBAND ONE LAST TIME 
FOR HIS FUNERAL 
AND IN A DANK PRISON JUST OUTSIDE THE PALACE WALLS 
CHINA'S MINISTER OF REVENUE XIA YUANJI 
INCARCERATED FOR OFFENDING THE EMPEROR 
IS STILL REELING FROM THE NEWS OF YONGLE'S DEATH 
EACH KNEW THE EMPEROR INTIMATELY 
EACH TOOK THE CHILLING STORY OF BEIJING'S BLOODY BEGINNINGS TO THEIR GRAVE 
BUT THERE IS A WAY TO GIVE THEM BACK THEIR VOICE 
CHINESE SPECIALISTS AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY 
HAVE COMBED THE LONG NEGLECTED CHRONICLES OF THE MING DYNASTY 
TO DIG OUT THEIR TALE 
HARDLY ANY OF THESE ANCIENT TEXTS HAVE EVER BEEN TRANSLATED INTO MODERN MANDARIN LET ALONE ENGLISH 
NOW AT LAST THEY HAVE 
AND IT IS THEIR WORDS THAT AFTER SIX CENTURIES 
WILL BREATHE LIFE BACK INTO THESE THREE 
VERY REAL MEMBERS OF YONGLE'S COURT 
I'M LOOKING AT ONE OF THE CLOSING CHAPTERS 
IN A TEXT CALLED THE MING VERITABLE RECORDS 
IT'S ONE OF THE CLOSING CHAPTERS FOR THE REIGN OF YONGLE 
AND IT INCORPORATES AN ACCOUNT AN ABBREVIATED ACCOUNT 
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEATH AND THE MOURNING THAT FOLLOWED HIS DEATH 
AND IT INCLUDES A VERY MOVING EVOCATIVE EULOGY 
ON THE OUTSIDE YOU WERE SEVERE 
STRICT EVEN 
BUT ON THE INSIDE YOU WERE BENEVOLENT AND KIND 
BRAVE CERTAINLY 
COURAGEOUS OF COURSE 
A TALENT FOR THE MOST CUNNING OF STRATEGIES 
YOU UNDOUBTEDLY KNEW HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF PEOPLE 
IT WAS THIS COMBINATION OF SEVERITY AND BENEVOLENCE 
THIS BALANCE THAT MADE HIM 
AN EFFECTIVE MILITARY AND CIVIL LEADER 
BUT WHAT I REMEMBER MOST ABOUT YOU 
MY EMPEROR 
MY LORD 
IS THAT YOU WENT FAR FAR BEYOND THE ORDINARY 
YOU COULD NOT ABIDE MEDIOCRITY 
NOTHING IN YOUR LIFE COULD HOLD YOU BACK 
THE EUNUCH HAI SHOU WAS RIGHT 
YONGLE HAD LET NOTHING STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS LIFE LONG OBSESSION 
TO MAKE THE CHINESE EMPIRE A WORLD SUPERPOWER 
AND AT ITS HEART WAS HIS GRAND PALACE THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
THIS BUILDING STILL STANDS TODAY AS THE SYMBOL 
OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE AND THEIR GREAT AND GLORIOUS HISTORY 
ONLY SOMEONE WHO HAD OVER WEANING POWER 
AND OVER WEANING PRIDE COULD BRING SUCH A VISION TO COMPLETION 
AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TOURISTS 
POUR THROUGH THE GATES FROM TIANANMEN SQUARE EVERY DAY 
TO MARVEL AT THE FAIRY TALE WORLD OF THE EMPERORS 
BUT THE FORBIDDEN CITY IS MORE THAN A MULTI COLOURED CANDY BOX 
YONGLE THE MAN WHO BUILT IT WAS NEVER CHOSEN TO BE EMPEROR 
THE PALACE IS STEEPED IN THE BLOOD 
OF THE THOUSANDS HE KILLED TO STEAL THE THRONE 
WHEN HE STARTED OUT THE CAPITAL OF CHINA WASN'T IN BEIJING 
BUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES TO THE SOUTH IN THE CITY OF NANJING 
THIRTY YEARS EARLIER IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE 
YONGLE WAS JUST A PRINCE IN THE IMPERIAL FAMILY 
THE FLEDGLING MING DYNASTY FACED A CRISIS 
HIS ELDEST BROTHER THE HEIR TO THE THRONE HAD UNEXPECTEDLY DIED 
THEIR FATHER THE EMPEROR 
HAD SUMMONED HIS REMAINING SONS TO THE IMPERIAL PALACE IN NANJING 
YONGLE THEN KNOWN AS THE PRINCE OF YAN 
WAS NOW THE EMPEROR'S ELDEST SURVIVING SON 
A WAR HERO FOR YEARS HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED 
THE NORTHERN REACHES OF CHINA FROM THE MONGOLS 
THE EMPIRE'S GREATEST ENEMY 
THIS WARRIOR PRINCE FELT CERTAIN THAT HIS FATHER THE EMPEROR 
WOULD NOW REWARD HIS MILITARY PROWESS 
AND PROCLAIM HIM HIS SUCCESSOR 
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER CLAIMANT TO THE THRONE 
THE EMPEROR'S ELDEST GRANDSON THE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD JIANWEN 
JIANWEN WAS NOT LIKE HIS UNCLE THE PRINCE HE HAD NEVER SEEN BATTLE 
HE WAS FAR HAPPIER HIS NOSE BURIED IN A BOOK 
BUT THE RULES OF SUCCESSION HAD BEEN LAID DOWN 
THE THRONE MUST PASS FROM FIRST BORN SON TO FIRST BORN SON 
THE EMPEROR MADE HIS DECISION 
HE CHOSE HIS GRANDSON OVER THE PRINCE 
HE HAD NO RIGHT TO THE THRONE 
HE KNEW THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT 
AND WHEN HIS FATHER WENT ON TO PASS THE EMPIRE DOWN 
FROM HIS ELDEST SON TO HIS ELDER SON HIS GRANDSON 
WHO WAS JUST A YOUNG MAN 
COMPLETELY UNTRAINED AND INEXPERIENCED 
I THINK HE SENSED A TREMENDOUS SENSE OF LOSS 
THIS DEEP SENSE OF LOSS WOULD PUSH YONGLE DOWN A NEW ROAD 
THAT WOULD LEAD ALL THE WAY TO THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
HE RETURNED TO THE FAR NORTHERN TOWN OF BEIPING TO LICK HIS WOUNDS 
HE'D RUN HIS OWN FIEFDOM FROM HERE SINCE HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD 
THIS WAS HIS POWER BASE 
YONGLE WAS FURIOUS 
ACCORDING TO THE MING CHRONICLES 
HE BELIEVED HIS FATHER HAD NOT JUST CHOSEN A WEAK SUCCESSOR 
HE HAD BROKEN A PROMISE 
THESE ARE WORDS THAT THE PRINCE OF YAN'S FATHER 
ALLEGEDLY SAID ABOUT THE PRINCE 
OF ALL THE PRINCES THERE'S NONE WHO EQUALS THE PRINCE OF YAN 
FOR HE IS THE MOST BENEVOLENT AND FILIAL 
IT IS MY PREFERENCE THAT HE BE CHOSEN 
MY FATHER PROMISED ME THE THRONE 
MY SON IS WORTHY LIGHT AND BENEVOLENT GENEROUS 
HE'S ALSO BRAVE AND MARSHAL LIKE THAT'S WHAT HE SAID 
ALL THE ANGRY PRINCE NEEDED NOW 
WAS THE SPARK TO CONVINCE HIM TO SEIZE THE THRONE FOR HIMSELF 
HE DIDN'T HAVE LONG TO WAIT 
ONE ACCOUNT TELLS THAT A SOOTHSAYER HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO THE TAVERN 
HE FORETOLD THAT ONE DAY SOON THE PRINCE WOULD BE EMPEROR 
IT WAS A PROPHESY REMEMBERED LONG AFTER 
BY YONGLE'S MOST LOYAL SERVANT THE EUNUCH HAI SHOU 
EVERYONE AT COURT KNEW THE LEGEND 
HOW THE SOOTHSAYER BOWED DOWN BEFORE YOU AND SAID 
YOUR MAJESTY WHY DO YOU LOWER YOURSELF 
BY COMING TO A LOWLY TAVERN LIKE THIS 
YOU HAVE THE BEARING OF A DRAGON 
AND THE WAYS OF A PHOENIX 
YOUR FACE IS LIKE A BRIGHT SUN 
SHINING FROM THE CENTRE OF THE SKY 
YOU HAVE THE GAIT OF A TIGER 
AND YOUR VOICE PEALS LIKE THE BELL 
THERE IS NO QUESTION WHATSOEVER THAT YOU ARE THE TRUE SON OF HEAVEN 
THE IMPACT ON YONGLE OF THE SOOTHSAYER'S PROPHESY 
THAT HE WAS THE SON OF HEAVEN 
CAN TODAY BE SEEN IN THE VERY DESIGN AND FORM OF THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
THE EMPERORS OF CHINA BELIEVED THEY WERE CHOSEN BY HEAVEN 
TO RULE ON EARTH 
TO PROFESSOR GEOFFREY RIEGEL 
IT EXPLAINS WHY YONGLE ALIGNED HIS PALACE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH 
DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH THE POLE STAR 
THE CELESTIAL HOME OF THE SUPREME DEITY 
THE WHOLE PALACE COMPLEX IS BUILT ALONG A CENTRAL AXIS 
THE AXIS OF THE WORLD 
AND IT'S IMAGINED THAT THIS CENTRAL AXIS GOING TO THE NORTH 
CONNECTS UP WITH THE POLE STAR WITH THE NORTH STAR 
THE POLE STAR IS SEEN AS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE IT'S THE FIXED STAR IN THE HEAVENS 
AND ALL OF THE OTHER CELESTIAL BODIES 
ALL OF THE OTHER STARS REVOLVE AROUND THE POLE STAR 
WHILE IT STAYS FIXED IN ITS CENTRAL POWERFUL POSITION 
AND SO IF ONE HAS THE PALACE COMPLEX ALONG THIS AXIS 
THAT IS LINED UP WITH THE POLE STAR IT'S THE SAME IDEA 
EVERYTHING IN THE FOUR DIRECTIONS 
SUSPEND FROM THIS CENTRAL POINT REPRESENTED BY THESE PALACES 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF NANJING 
YONGLE'S FATHER THE EMPEROR DIED 
NEWS SOON REACHED THE PRINCE THAT HIS BOOKISH NEPHEW 
JIANWEN ONLY TWENTY YEARS OLD BUT NOW WITH A YOUNG FAMILY 
HAD BEEN PROCLAIMED THE NEW EMPEROR OF CHINA 
IN NANJING JIANWEN CULTIVATED A STYLE OF GOVERNMENT 
THAT WAS FAR REMOVED FROM THE WARRING WAYS OF HIS UNCLE 
FOR THE NEW EMPEROR 
THE CAPITAL NANJING WOULD BE CIVIL INTELLECTUAL SCHOLARLY 
IT WAS THE LARGEST METROPOLIS IN THE WEALTHIEST REGION OF CHINA 
PERHAPS THERE WERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING HERE 
NANJING HAD A HUGE POPULATION 
FAR LARGER THAN ANY CITY IN EUROPE AT THE TIME 
I MEAN PARIS AND LONDON WERE TINY IN COMPARISON 
ALL THE POETS ALL THE PAINTERS ALL THE INTELLECTUALS 
EVERYONE YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE WOULD COME HERE 
BUT IN YONGLE'S MIND 
A DYNASTY RUN BY POETS AND PAINTERS WOULD NEVER LAST 
NOT WHEN THERE WERE WARRING ENEMIES LIKE THE MONGOLS 
WHO EYED CHINA HUNGRILY 
ON THE THIRTEENTH JULY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWO HE DECIDED TO TAKE ACTION 
THE PRINCE OF YAN ARRIVED HERE WITH HIS FORCES 
IN FRONT OF THESE MASSIVE DEFENCES 
THE JIANWEN EMPEROR INSIDE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS SAFE 
THE ONLY WAY THAT THE PRINCE OF YAN COULD GET IN WAS THROUGH TREACHERY 
AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
ONE OF THE JIANWEN EMPEROR'S LEADING GENERALS OPENED THE GATES 
AND ALLOWED THE PRINCE OF YAN TO ENTER THE CITY 
NO ONE COULD FORGET THE NIGHT YONGLE THE PRINCE OF YAN 
RODE INTO NANJING TO SEIZE THE THRONE 
LEAST OF ALL THE JAILED COURTIER XIA YUANJI 
HE WAS THERE THAT NIGHT A JUNIOR MINISTER IN THE IMPERIAL COURT 
THE TALE HE WOULD TELL OVER TWENTY YEARS LATER DEFIES BELIEF 
BUT IT WAS RECORDED IN THE ANCIENT CHINESE CHRONICLES 
THE PRINCE OF YAN WAS CLOSING IN 
JIANWEN WAS PACING BACK AND FORTH 
WE KNEW HE WAS CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE 
BUT THEN A EUNUCH KNEELED DOWN BEFORE HIM 
AND TOLD HIM A SECRET 
BEFORE WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER THE EMPEROR HONGWU 
WAS ABOUT TO DIE HE WROTE YOU A LETTER 
AND ASKED THAT IT BE OPENED ONLY IN A CASE OF AN EMERGENCY 
SERVANTS SCURRIED TO FETCH THE LETTER 
WHICH WAS LOCKED INSIDE A VERMILLION BOX 
IT WAS A PLAN OF ESCAPE 
ALSO INSIDE THE BOX 
WERE A SWORD TEN INGOTS OF GOLD 
AND 
A RAZOR TO SHAVE HIS HEAD 
IT WAS AN INGENIOUS PLAN 
THE YOUNG EMPEROR JIANWEN WAS TO FLEE FROM THE PALACE 
DISGUISED AS A BUDDHIST MONK 
NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE WHETHER HE ESCAPED OR NOT 
BUT IN THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT OF THE ATTACK IN THE MING CHRONICLES 
YONGLE CLAIMED THE EMPEROR JIANWEN MADE A GRUESOME DECISION 
RATHER THAN SURRENDER TO HIS UNCLE HE TORCHED HIS OWN PALACE 
CONDEMNING HIS FAMILY TO BURN 
ONCE THE FLAMES HAD DIED YONGLE THE PRINCE 
FORCIBLY ENTERED THE PALACE IN NANJING 
TO SEARCH FOR THE YOUNG EMPEROR 
HE WAS READY TO SEIZE THE THRONE JUST AS THE SOOTHSAYER HAD FORETOLD 
BUT HIS NEPHEW JIANWEN WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN 
RUMOURS SOON BEGAN TO CIRCULATE THAT A MONK FLANKED BY GUARDS 
HAD BEEN SIGHTED FLEEING FROM THE CITY 
IT WAS THE LAST THING THE PRINCE WANTED TO HEAR 
BUT THEN THREE BLACKENED BODIES WERE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM 
THE EMPEROR'S SIX YEAR OLD SON THE EMPRESS 
AND THE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN 
SO CHARRED IT COULD NOT BE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED 
I THINK THE DISCOVERY OF THE CHARRED BODIES 
WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRINCE OF YAN 
BECAUSE HE COULD LEGITIMATELY SAY THAT THERE WAS NO EMPEROR 
AND HE COULD TAKE OVER HE WAS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT ALSO LAID OUT THE POSSIBILITY 
BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED 
THAT THE JIANWEN EMPEROR HAD FLED AND FLED IN DISGUISE 
AND COULD COME BACK TO CLAIM THE THRONE 
THEREFORE HE BASICALLY HAD TO LEGITIMATE HIS TAKE OVER FROM POWER 
IN MANY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS 
AND HE TRIED TO FORCE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT HIM AS THE EMPEROR 
AND OF COURSE MANY DID NOT RESULTING IN A BLOOD BATH 
THE FIRST MOVE YONGLE MADE TO LEGITIMISE HIS TAKE OVER 
WAS TO DEMAND THE OFFICIAL SANCTION OF CHINA'S POLITICAL ELITE 
BUT TO HIM NONE WAS MORE IMPORTANT 
THAN THE EMPIRE'S MOST RESPECTED SCHOLAR FANG XIAORU 
THEIR CONVERSATION THAT DAY WAS RECORDED IN THE MING CHRONICLES 
DO NOT CAUSE YOURSELF ANY MORE TROUBLE SIR 
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE 
THE EMPEROR IT WOULD SEEM HAS BURNT HIMSELF TO DEATH 
THE COUNTRY NEEDS A RULER 
A GROWN UP 
PROCLAIM MY SUCCESSION TO THE EMPIRE 
ONLY YOU CAN WRITE IT 
NO 
THAT IS INDEED REGRETTABLE 
AND SO IT WAS TOLD 
AND WILL BE PASSED ON TO GENERATIONS FROM NOW 
FANG XIAORU ETCHED ON THE PALACE FLOOR IN HIS OWN BLOOD 
JUST ONE WORD 
USURPER 
USURPER ONE WHO STEALS THE THRONE 
THIS VILE SLUR WOULD DOG THE PRINCE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE 
IN RETALIATION HE PURGED THE CITY OF ALL POLITICAL OPPONENTS 
KILLING TENS OF THOUSANDS 
ONLY THEN DID HE PROCLAIM HIMSELF YONGLE 
THE EMPEROR OF PERPETUAL HAPPINESS 
BUT WHISPERS THAT THE FORMER EMPEROR JIANWEN HAD ESCAPED 
AND WOULD ONE DAY RETURN TO RECLAIM THE THRONE REFUSED TO DIE 
YONGLE NOW UNDERSTOOD HE MUST WAGE A NEW WAR 
TO PROVE TO HIS PEOPLE THAT HE WAS THE ONE AND ONLY EMPEROR OF CHINA 
HE NEEDED A GRAND NEW BEGINNING 
AND A CLEAN REPUTATION 
FIRST YONGLE INSTRUCTED THE SCHOLARS OF CHINA'S LITERARY ACADEMY 
TO SUGAR COAT THE STORY OF THE USURPATION 
AND PRESENT HIMSELF AS HIS FATHER'S FIRST AND ONLY CHOICE FOR EMPEROR 
IN THE STROKE OF A PEN 
HE WOULD QUITE LITERALLY ERASE THE REIGN OF HIS PREDECESSOR 
FROM THE OFFICIAL HISTORY 
PARANOID THAT HE MIGHT BE DEMONISED FOR REWRITING HISTORY 
YONGLE DECIDED TO COVER HIS TRACKS 
ONCE THE CHIEF HISTORIAN HAD COMPLETED HIS TASK 
HE WAS DULY REWARDED FOR HIS EFFORTS 
AND LEFT OUT IN THE SNOW TO DIE 
IN NANJING YONGLE HAD DONE ALL IN HIS POWER TO STIFLE THE OPPOSITION 
BUT THIS WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE JIANWEN'S CITY 
IF YONGLE WAS TO ASSERT HIMSELF 
AS THE NEW UNASSAILABLE EMPEROR OF CHINA 
IT MADE SENSE TO BUILD A NEW CAPITAL 
AND A NEW PALACE WHERE HIS SUPPORT BASE WAS STRONGEST 
IT IS TIME FOR A FRESH START 
DON'T YOU THINK 
A NEW CAPITAL FOR A NEW EMPEROR 
IN NANJING THOSE COURTIERS WHO HAD SURVIVED THE PURGE 
GATHERED TO HEAR THE NEW EMPEROR'S SHATTERING PLAN 
TO SHIFT THE CAPITAL OF CHINA FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES NORTH 
TO HIS OWN POWERBASE BEIPING 
I WOULDN'T WANT IT SAID THAT THIS LITTLE BUILDING PROJECT 
IS MY DECISION ALONE 
THE WORK WILL NO DOUBT BE A BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE 
IT WILL BE BETTER IF WE WERE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER 
AMONG THE GROVELLING COURTIERS 
EAGER TO PLEASE THE FORMIDABLE NEW EMPEROR THAT DAY 
WAS THE MINISTER WHO TWENTY YEARS LATER 
WOULD BE LOCKED UP IN THE PRISON OUTSIDE THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
XIA YUANJI 
YOUR MAJESTY 
WE SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT BEIPING IS THE BEST PLACE FOR A NEW CAPITAL 
THE RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS PROVIDE GOOD DEFENCE 
THE WATER IS SWEET AND THE SOIL FERTILE 
THE PROVINCE OF BEIPING IS TRULY THE PLACE FROM WHICH YOUR MAJESTY AROSE 
YOUR FATHER WAS A CONQUEROR 
AND HE ELEVATED THE STATUS OF HIS HOME TOWN 
PERHAPS YOU COULD FOLLOW THE PRECEDENT OF YOUR FATHER 
AND MAKE BEIPING YOUR CAPITAL 
THIS GRAND ENTERPRISE WILL BENEFIT A MILLION GENERATIONS 
AND SO IT SHALL BE 
BEIPING SHALL BE NO MORE 
A NEW CITY A NEW CAPITAL 
THE NORTHERN CAPITAL 
BEIJING 
THE RESULT OF THE EMPEROR'S DECISION THAT DAY 
IS THE HEAVING SMOGGY METROPOLIS OF BEIJING WE KNOW NOW 
THOUGH THIS WAS HIS HOME TOWN 
YONGLE HAD ANOTHER MORE SIGNIFICANT REASON 
FOR SHIFTING THE CAPITAL HERE TO THE NORTH OF CHINA 
IT WAS CLOSE TO THE BORDER WITH THEIR MONGOL ENEMIES 
YONGLE WANTED TO BUILD A MUCH BIGGER GRANDER CITY 
WITH MORE PEOPLE AND MORE SOLDIERS 
BUT HE WOULD HAVE TO BUILD IT VIRTUALLY FROM SCRATCH 
IT WAS BASICALLY BUILT IN A BARREN PLAIN 
WHICH HAD VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE 
IT HAD BEEN DE POPULATED AS A RESULT OF FAMINES 
NATURAL DISASTERS WARS CIVIL WARS FOR DECADES BEFORE THAT 
AND IN ORDER TO BUILD IT THEY HAD TO BRING TOGETHER 
THE LABOUR AND THE MATERIAL FROM ALL OVER CHINA 
FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY 
BUT HOW WAS YONGLE ABLE TO ORCHESTRATE WHAT WAS BACK THEN 
THE BIGGEST BUILDING PROJECT OF ITS TIME 
YOU ONLY NEED TO LOOK A MILE FROM THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
AT THE SPEED AND SCALE OF CONSTRUCTION THAT HAS TAKEN OVER 
THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT OF TODAY'S BEIJING 
WELL THIS IS THE CHINA WORLD TRADE CENTRE TOWER THREE 
IT'S GOING TO BE THE TALLEST BUILDING IN BEIJING 
WHEN IT'S FINISHED AT SEVENTY FOUR STOREYS 
IT'S NEAR THE TOP NOW SO AT ABOUT SIXTY FLOORS 
AND IT'LL BE FINISHED AT THE TOP WITHIN SIX WEEKS FROM NOW 
IT'S QUITE A REMARKABLE BUILDING THREE MILLION SQUARE FEET 
AND IT'S HERE IN THE CENTRE OF BEIJING 
A STAGGERING HALF OF THE WORLD'S STEEL AND A THIRD OF ITS CONCRETE 
IS CURRENTLY BEING USED 
IN THE BIGGEST METROPOLITAN MAKE OVER ON THE PLANET 
SOON THREE HUNDRED MORE SKYSCRAPERS WILL CREATE AN ENTIRELY NEW SKYLINE 
FOR THE CHINESE CAPITAL 
IN THE TIME OF THE EMPEROR YONGLE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND THE RESOURCES 
OF THE NATION WERE MOBILISED ON THE WORD OF ONE MAN 
THINGS HAVEN'T REALLY CHANGED 
THE IMMEDIATE IMPRESSION IS JUST THE SPEED AT WHICH THINGS ARE DONE HERE 
WE'RE IN A CENTRALISED ECONOMY 
WE HAVE A ONE PARTY STATE AND DECISIONS ARE MADE QUICKLY AND 
THE PLANNING PROCESS IS FAST WHILE THERE MAY NOT BE THE SAME LEVEL 
OF ACCOUNTABILITY THERE IS IN THE WEST THERE CERTAINLY IS THE SAME AMOUNT OF CONFUSION OR DELAY 
AND CHINA'S DETERMINED THAT PROCESSES ARE NOT SLOWED DOWN IN ITS BID TO BECOME WORLD ECONOMIC POWER 
IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIX THE EMPEROR YONGLE DREW UP THE BLUEPRINT FOR HIS NEW CAPITAL 
AT ITS HEART WOULD BE THE VAST PALACE COMPLEX THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
ON FIVE TIMES AS MUCH LAND AS TODAY'S BUCKINGHAM PALACE IT WOULD 
SOON TAKE ITS PLACE IN HISTORY AS THE LARGEST PALACE IN THE WORLD 
TO OVERSEE THE FINANCES OF THIS IMMENSE PROJECT WAS THE MINISTER XIA YUANJI 
I WAS MADE A MINISTER OF REVENUE 
PLACED IN CHARGE OF RUNNING THE FINANCES OF THE EMPIRE 
THE EMPEROR ORDERED ME TO CHANNEL VAST FUNDS INTO 
THE CREATION OF THE GREAT GATES AND PALACES OF HIS NEW NORTHERN CAPITAL 
BEIJING 
I RESPONDED TO HIS CALL 
I WAS UNFAILING IN MY DESIRE TO HELP THE NATION 
HELPING THE NATION MEANT MOBILISING OVER A MILLION PEOPLE 
TO GATHER RESOURCES FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE EMPIRE 
UNPAID AND HOUNDED BY YONGLE'S SOLDIERS WORKERS WERE ORDERED 
DEEP INTO THE UNCHARTED FORESTS OF THE SOUTHWEST TO FELL GIANT TIMBERS 
AT THE MERCY OF PESTILENCE WILD ANIMALS AND SHEER EXHAUSTION 
IT WAS SAID ONLY HALF MADE IT OUT ALIVE 
AND UP ON THE ICY PLAINS OF THE NORTH THOUSANDS MORE WERE DISPATCHED TO QUARRY STONE 
IF MATERIALS WERE FOUND TO BE SUBSTANDARD IN ANY WAY THEN THE LABOURERS WERE PUNISHED 
TO SUPPLY THIS ARMY OF WORKERS AND TO FERRY THE MATERIALS 
FROM ONE END OF THE COUNTRY TO THE OTHER 
YONGLE ORDERED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MASSIVE SYSTEM OF WATERWAYS 
IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT HIS PALACE 
HE HAD TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST 
WITHOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE HE COULDN'T FEED ALL THE WORKERS 
HE COULDN'T FEED ALL THE LABOURERS 
HE COULDN'T FEED THE ARTISANS AND HE COULDN'T FEED HIS ARMY 
THERE WAS NO WAY TO DO IT BY LAND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR TOO COSTLY 
AND THERE WASN'T THE ROAD SYSTEM THERE WAS NOTHING THERE 
THE SOLUTION WAS TO COMMAND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN TO RE DREDGE AND EXTEND THE GRAND CANAL 
THIS VAST TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEAR OLD SYSTEM OF WATERWAYS HAD IN THE LAST 
HUNDRED YEARS SILTED UP AND BECOME UN NAVIGABLE 
THE YONGLE EMPEROR ENCOURAGED THE OPENING OF THE GRAND CANAL ALL THE WAY UP TO BEIJING 
IT WAS REALLY BECAUSE OF THE GRAND CANAL AND ALL THE FEEDER CANALS 
THAT ALLOWED CHINA TO CONTINUE AND DEVELOP 
TO BE THE WEALTHIEST EMPIRE IN THE WORLD 
THE MAIN RIVERS OF CHINA FED INTO THE GRAND CANAL 
WHICH ONCE IT WAS RE OPENED FLOWED FOR AN INCREDIBLE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED MILES 
YONGLE WOULD CREATE THE LONGEST MANMADE WATERWAY IN THE WORLD 
ALL THE WAY TO BEIJING 
THE EMPEROR ORDERED ME OUT ON AN IMPERIAL INSPECTION 
TO PUNISH ANY IDLE WORKERS I COULD FIND WITH THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE LAW 
FOR THIS TASK HE PROVIDED ME WITH A FULL CONTINGENT OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD 
CONDITIONS HARSH AND I FEAR THE PEOPLE COULD NEVER WITHSTAND THAT 
AND WOULD BE FALSELY ACCUSED OF LAZINESS' 
TO SUPERVISE THE CONSTRUCTION YONGLE WOULD NEED A WHOLE NEW TIER OF MANAGERS 
IN NANJING A TEAM OF EUNUCHS WAS RECORDING THE EXACT DIMENSIONS OF EVERY BRICK 
EVERY PILLAR AND EVERY STAIR OF THE OLD PALACE SO THAT THE NEW PALACE 
COULD BE BUILT EVEN LARGER AND MORE MAGNIFICENT 
FOR YONGLE THE EU H. WERE THE PERFECT LACKEYS 
IT WAS SAID THEY WOULD SLAVISHLY DO THE BIDDING OF ANY EMPEROR 
A EUNUCH IS A MAN WHO HAS BEEN EMASCULATED 
HAS LOST OR HAD HIS 
BALLS HIS GENITALIA CUT OFF 
AND THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT IS THAT 
THE EUNUCH CANNOT HAVE HIS OWN CHILDREN 
THEREFORE HIS LOYALTY WILL BE TO THE PERSON WHO EMPLOYS HIM 
IN OTHER WORDS THE YONGLE EMPEROR 
NO ONE KNOWS WHEN OR WHERE YONGLE'S MOST TRUSTED EUNUCH HAI SHOU WAS CASTRATED 
ONLY THAT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD HE WAS A TEENAGED BOY 
THE YOUNG MEN WHO UNDERWENT THE OPERATION WERE MOST OFTEN ESCORTED 
BY A GUARANTOR WHO WOULD WITNESS THE OPERATION AND PAY THE CASTRATOR 
IT WAS A DANGEROUS PROCEDURE IN ADDITION TO THE EXCRUCIATING PAIN ONCE BOTH THE PENIS AND THE SCROTUM 
HAD BEEN SLICED OFF THERE WAS AN EXTREMELY HIGH CHANCE OF EXCESSIVE BLEEDING AND URINARY INFECTION 
IF THEY SURVIVED HEALING COULD TAKE MONTHS 
THE EUNUCHS' SO CALLED TREASURE PARTS WERE KEPT IN JAR 
AND PRIZED AS PROOF OF THEIR UNFLINCHING LOYALTY 
THOUGH NO LONGER A MAN 
THE EUNUCH COULD ENJOY A LIFE OF UNTOLD PRIVILEGE AND WEALTH 
AS THE MING CHRONICLES REVEAL 
FOR THOSE SUCH AS YONGLE'S ADORING SERVANT HAI SHOU 
IT WAS WORTH THE SACRIFICE 
ANY SLIGHT MISTAKE WE MIGHT EVER MAKE AS A EUNUCH WAS WATCHED CAREFULLY 
AND YOU MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT 
MINDFUL OF THE MISTAKES OF PREVIOUS GENERATIONS 
YOU ALWAYS PROTECTED THOSE WHO WERE LOYAL TO YOU 
AND TREATED US HONESTLY 
BUT IF WE SLIPPED UP 
YOU NEVER FAILED TO POINT IT OUT UNTIL WE RECTIFY IT 
IF WE DIDN'T DO SO IMMEDIATELY WE MIGHT LOSE EVERYTHING 
OUR HOUSE OUR BENEFITS EVEN IF WE HAD ACCUMULATED MERIT IN THE PAST 
BUT IF WE SERVED YOU WELL 
OH THE REWARDS 
IT APPEARS TO US THAT YONGLE 
PLACED MORE TRUST IN HIS EUNUCHS 
THAN HE DID IN VIRTUALLY ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE IMPERIAL COURT 
AND TO BE FAVOURED THAT WAY 
BY THE EMPEROR WAS OF ENORMOUS BENEFIT 
NOT ONLY TO HAI SHOU BUT TO HIS ENTIRE FAMILY 
YONGLE'S FORBIDDEN CITY WOULD ONE DAY BE STAFFED 
BY A SHADOW GOVERNMENT OF MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND EUNUCHS 
THEY WERE ENTRUSTED NOT JUST TO SUPERVISE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PALACE 
BUT TO FILL IT WITH SUMPTUOUS FITTINGS AND FURNISHINGS 
OVER ONE QUARTER OF THE PALACE WOULD BE GIVEN OVER TO HOUSING 
THE MOST EXQUISITE TREASURE OF ALL 
WOMEN 
IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT THE EUNUCH HAI SHOU WAS SENT ON AN IMPERIAL MISSION TO KOREA 
TO DEMAND FOR THE EMPEROR'S NEW PALACE SILKS 
CLOTH FURS AND VIRGINS 
KOREA 
YOU SENT US THERE TO TELL THE KING TO OFFER UP HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL GOLDS 
HE KOWTOWED BEFORE US AND SAID 
I DON'T DARE REFUSE TO DO MY UTMOST TO FULFIL HIS MAJESTY'S WISHES 
HE SENT HIS OFFICIALS ACROSS THE LAND TO SELECT VIRGINS 
IMPOVERISHED ONES 
THOSE FROM GOOD FAMILIES NO MATTER 
ANY PRETTY ONES HAD TO BE REPORTED 
NONE WERE TO BE ALLOWED TO GET AWAY 
ANYONE WHO HID THEIR DAUGHTERS OR CUT THEIR HAIR OFF 
TO MAKE THEM LOOK UGLY WAS ARRESTED AND DEPRIVED OF THEIR POSSESSIONS 
THEN THE GIRLS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE US AT THE PALACE 
ONE OF THE YOUNG VIRGINS BROUGHT BEFORE HAI SHOU 
WAS THE TEENAGED DAUGHTER OF A KOREAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL 
YEARS LATER IN THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
SHE'D REMEMBER THAT DAY AS IF IT WAS YESTERDAY 
HER NAME WAS LADY CUI 
WE WERE ALL BEAUTIFUL VIRGINS 
AND ALL BETWEEN THE AGES OF THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE 
I WAS SO NERVOUS THAT DAY 
WE STOOD THERE NEATLY IN LINES OF A HUNDRED 
ALL ARRANGED BY HEIGHT SO THAT THE EMPEROR'S EUNUCHS COULD INSPECT US 
SHOW ME YOUR HAND TURN OVER 
YOUR TEETH 
HAND IT MUST BE A TERRIFYING PROCESS TO GO THROUGH 
I DON'T THINK THE WOMAN HAD MUCH SAY IN THOSE DAYS 
IF THEIR FATHER DECIDED THEY WANTED THEIR DAUGHTER TO BE THE CONCUBINE THEY HAD NO SAY 
OPEN OPEN THEY HAVE TO BE BEAUTIFUL HAVE TO BE YOUNG 
THEY ALSO HAVE AUSPICIOUS LOOKS 
FOR EXAMPLE A WOMAN WHO HAVE FOR EXAMPLE 
IF A WOMAN GOT VERY SHORT UPPER LIPS 
OR VERY THIN EARLOBE THAT'S NOT AUSPICIOUS SIGN THAT'S NO GOOD 
CHINESE WOMAN DON'T HAVE A STRONG ODOUR AS WESTERNERS BUT THEY 
THINK IT'S VERY BAD IF THEY HAVE BAD ODOUR FROM UNDER THEIR ARMS 
THAT THIS ONE CERTAINLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
THOSE WHO AT NIGHT WOULD SNORE WOULD FART OR WOULD 
TALK DRIBBLE SO THAT'S NO GOOD 
WHITTLED DOWN TO THE FINAL TEN 
THE REMAINING GIRLS WERE TAKEN OFF FOR A THOROUGH INTERNAL EXAMINATION BY SENIOR PALACE WOMEN 
AS THE ANCIENT TEXTS MAKE CLEAR ONLY THE PURIST YOUNG LADIES 
WOULD BE SHIPPED AWAY TO A NEW LIFE OF UNIMAGINABLE LUXURY 
ON THE THIRD DAY THE EUNUCHS WENT ROUND MEASURING OUR HANDS AND OUR FEET 
AND WE WERE MADE TO WALK ROUND AND ROUND SO THEY COULD OBSERVE OUR STYLE 
OF THE THREE HUNDRED GIRLS THAT WERE BROUGHT IN 
JUST FIVE OF US WERE SELECTED 
WITH THE OTHER FOUR GIRLS LADY CUI WAS TRANSPORTED SIX HUNDRED MILES TO CHINA 
TO ENTER THE EMPEROR'S NEW HAREM 
SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER HOME AGAIN 
UNTIL THE FORBIDDEN CITY WAS COMPLETED LADY CUI WOULD BE KEPT IN THE OLD IMPERIAL PALACE IN NANJING 
THE NOVICE CONCUBINE HAD MUCH TO LEARN 
MAY I LEAVE THE PALACE EVER SEE WHAT IS OUTSIDE THERE IS NO NEED 
ANY REQUEST YOU SHOULD HAVE FOR CLOTHES FOOD GOLD WILL BE MET 
THOUGH IT SHOULD FIRSTLY BE REPORTED 
TO THE EUNUCH IN CHARGE OF THE IMPERIAL LIFE HERE IN THE PALACE 
THE APPROPRIATE OFFICIAL WILL OFFICIALS ALSO EUNUCHS 
THEY WILL BE DISPATCHED TO VERIFY YOUR REQUESTS 
ONCE YOUR REQUEST IS VERIFIED YOU MAY COLLECT YOUR THINGS 
FROM THE IMPERIAL TREASURY AND DON'T TRIFLE WITH PROCEDURES 
IF A EUNUCH FAILS TO VERIFY AND DOUBLE CHECK ONE OF YOUR REQUESTS 
HE WILL BE SENTENCED TO DEATH 
THE EUNUCH HAI SHOU WAS NOT JOKING 
PRECISE RULES GOVERNING EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE IN THE PALACE ARE RECORDED 
IN DETAIL IN THE MING CHRONICLES KNOWN AS THE ANCESTRAL INSTRUCTIONS 
WHAT IF I SHOULD FALL ILL MAY I SUMMON A DOCTOR INTO THE PALACE 
PALACE PEOPLE CANNOT SUMMON FOR A DOCTOR 
AND IT'S UP TO THE OFFICIAL OF THE IMPERIAL MEDICINE BUREAU 
THEY WILL ASSESS THE SYMPTOMS AND SUMMON THE APPROPRIATE DOCTOR 
THEN THEY TOGETHER WITH THREE EUNUCHS TWO OLD MAIDS 
THEY WILL ACCOMPANY THE DOCTOR INTO THE PALACE TO VIEW THE PATIENT 
IF THE EUNUCHS AND OFFICIALS DO NOT ACCOMPANY HIM IN 
AND ONLY THE OLD MAIDS LEAD HIM IN 
THEN THE SUPERVISING OFFICIAL GUARDING OFFICER 
BUREAU OFFICIAL ARE ALL TO BE BEHEADED 
IF LADY CUI WAS TO SURVIVE IN THIS DANGEROUS WORLD SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO MAKE ONE FALSE MOVE 
BUT IF SHE COULD CATCH THE EYE OF THE EMPEROR SHE COULD BECOME 
A WOMAN OF GREAT WEALTH AND GREAT POWER 
THROUGHOUT HISTORY THERE WERE ALWAYS SOME CONCUBINES WHO BECOME VERY POWERFUL SUCCESSFUL 
ONE LIVES IN HOPE IN THOSE DAYS TOO AND YOU WOULD HOPE 
YOU WILL BE FAVOURED BY THE EMPEROR AND YOU WILL PRODUCE A HEIR 
ONCE YOU GET TO THAT STAGE YOU WILL BE GIVEN HUGE AMOUNT MONEY 
AND YOU HAVE ENORMOUS POWER ALL YOUR FAMILY 
IS GIVEN TITLES AND A GLORY FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY 
WHILE LADY CUI WAS BEING INITIATED INTO PALACE LIFE 
THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE FORBIDDEN CITY HAD BEGUN IN BEIJING 
FOR OVER TEN YEARS RAW MATERIALS FROM ALL OVER CHINA HAD BEEN FLOODING INTO YONGLE'S NEW CAPITAL 
INCLUDING THE TIMBERS OF THE GIANT HARDWOODS THAT HAD BEEN FELLED 
A THOUSAND MILES AWAY IN THE FORESTS OF SZECHWAN 
OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE PALACES 
INDEED OF ALL OF THE BUILDINGS WITHIN THIS COMPLEX ARE THE COLUMNS 
THAT SUPPORT THESE VERY HEAVY ROOFS COVERED WITH COVERED WITH TILES 
BUT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE FORBIDDEN CITY THESE COLUMNS TELL A STORY 
THE STORY THEY TELL IS OF AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY 
ROLLED DOWN MOUNTAIN GULLIES BY TEAMS OF WOODCUTTERS 
THEN FLOATED NEARLY ONE THOUSAND MILES ALONG THE RIVERS AND CANALS 
OF CHINA'S EXTENSIVE NEW WATER SYSTEM 
EACH TIMBER HAD TAKEN AN ASTONISHING FOUR YEARS TO REACH BEIJING 
THE CHRONICLERS OF THE MING COURT WERE AWESTRUCK 
THE GREAT TIMBERS COURSED DOWN THE WATERS OF THE RIVERS AND CANALS 
IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT THEY MADE A SOUND LIKE THUNDER 
IN ONE PLACE THERE WAS A GIGANTIC ROCK BLOCKING THEIR PATH 
SO STRONG WAS THE WOOD THAT IT SPLIT THE ROCK IN TWO 
AND FLOWED THROUGH THE MIDDLE WITHOUT A SLIGHTEST DAMAGE TO ITSELF 
THE EMPEROR THOUGHT THIS WAS DONE WITH DIVINE HELP 
AND SO HE NAMED THE PLACE WHERE IT HAPPENED DIVINE WOOD MOUNTAIN 
UP TO THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TIMBERS WERE SOON PILED HIGH IN VAST LUMBER YARDS 
BY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN IT HAD BEEN OVER TEN YEARS SINCE YONGLE DECIDED TO BUILD THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
NOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CRAFTSMEN AND ENGINEERS CONVENED ON BEIJING READY FOR THE MAIN PHASE OF CONSTRUCTION 
TODAY IN THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
OFFICIALS ARE WORKING ON A MASSIVE NINE HUNDRED MILLION RESTORATION OF THE PALACE 
THEY HAVE DISCOVERED SOMETHING STRANGE 
AT EIGHT METRES THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THESE WOODEN BUILDINGS ARE FAR DEEPER THAN THEY NEED TO BE 
PROFESSOR GEOFFREY RIEGEL IS KEEN TO ASK CURATOR LI XIE PING WHY 
A POPULAR EXPLANATION OF WHY THE FOUNDATIONS ARE SO LARGE AND SO DEEP 
HAS BEEN THAT EMPERORS IN GENERAL AND PERHAPS THE YONGLE EMPEROR IN PARTICULAR 
WAS EXTREMELY WORRIED ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY PARANOID 
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PEOPLE TUNNELLING INTO THE FORBIDDEN CITY THUS TRYING TO ASSASSINATE HIM 
BUT MR. LI HAS COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY FOR THE DEEP FOUNDATIONS 
IN THE TIME OF YONGLE THERE WERE MAJOR EARTHQUAKES AT LEAST ONCE EVERY TEN YEARS 
ONCE THE FOUNDATIONS WERE LAID IT TOOK JUST THREE YEARS TO ERECT NEARLY ONE THOUSAND BUILDINGS 
AUDIENCE HALLS TEMPLES OFFICES AND RESIDENCES 
ALL MADE OF INTERCONNECTED WOODEN COLUMNS AND BEAMS AND WITHOUT A SINGLE NAIL BEING USED 
AND ONCE THE WALLS AND ROOFS WERE UP THE ARTISANS COULD GET GOING ON ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ACRES OF FLOORING 
SIX HUNDRED FORTY MILES FROM BEIJING IN THE CITY OF SUZHOU ONE OF THE FACTORIES THAT MADE 
OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION BRICKS FOR YONGLE'S GRAND PALACE IS STILL MAKING THEM IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY TODAY 
THIS SAYS 
MING DYNASTY 
EMPEROR YONGLE BESTOWED THE NAME IMPERIAL CERAMIC WORKSHOPS 
ALL THE PAVING STONES OUTSIDE IN THE COURTYARDS OF THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
AND INSIDE THE AUDIENCE HALLS WERE MADE BY HAND 
OR RATHER BY FEET 
THEY WERE THEN FIRED IN KILNS BUT IN SIX CENTURIES HAVE NEVER CEASED PRODUCTION 
AH I SEE THIS KILN HAS BEEN IN CONTINUOUS OPERATION FOR ABOUT SIX HUNDRED YEARS 
THAT'S REALLY AMAZING 
AND IN EACH FIRING THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND BRICKS 
AND THE BASIC MATERIAL THAT IS USED TO BAKE THE BRICKS 
IS THE HUSKS OF THE RICE GRAIN 
THE PAVING STONES AND BRICKS ARE FIRED FOR TWO WEEKS AFTER WHICH 
WATER IS SLOWLY LEAKED FROM ABOVE TO COOL THEM DOWN CHANGING THEM IN COLOUR FROM RED TO BLACK 
YONGLE HAD THEM LAID IN EVERY MAIN HALL AND PALACE IN THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
THE PAVING STONES FOR THE GRAND HALLS HAD TO CONFORM TO EXACT SPECIFICATIONS 
THEY WERE AND STILL ARE SMOOTHED 
TRIMMED AND MEASURED TO AN EXACT SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX CENTIMETRES SQUARE 
THE QUALITY OBVIOUSLY HAD TO BE ABSOLUTELY TOP NOTCH 
OTHERWISE IT SIMPLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE IMPERIAL AUTHORITIES 
AND NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS WAS INTENDED TO LAST FOREVER 
THE WOODCUTTER THE BOATMAN THE BRICK MAKER THE CRAFTSMEN 
ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN ALL HAD DEVOTED THE BEST PART OF FIFTEEN YEARS TOIL 
AND TAXES TO BUILDING YONGLE'S PALACE 
THE ARCHITECTURAL EXPRESSION OF ONE MAN'S DESPERATION TO LEGITIMISE HIS RULE 
THE PEOPLE WERE EXHAUSTED 
GREAT NUMBERS HAD DEFECTED FROM THE WORK GANGS THAT FELLED THE TIMBER AND QUARRIED THE STONE 
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT AFTER THE YEARS OF BUILDING THE EMPEROR'S PALACES 
NOW AT LAST WAS THE TIME TO ALLEVIATE THEIR SUFFERING 
TO EXEMPT THEM FROM YET MORE TAXES 
TO LET THEM RECOVER THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND RETURN TO THEIR HOMES 
BUT THE EMPEROR REFUSED TO LET UP THE PRESSURE ON HIS PEOPLE JUST YET 
HE HAD DECIDED TO UNVEIL HIS ARCHITECTURAL WONDER TO THE WORLD 
IN A GRAND OPENING CEREMONY JUST A FEW WEEKS LATER 
ON NEW YEAR'S DAY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY ONE 
HE HAD ALREADY STOWED AWAY THE FINEST TREASURES OF THE REALM 
IN THEIR OWN LAVISH QUARTERS AT THE BACK OF THE PALACE 
THE IMPERIAL HAREM 
THE FORBIDDEN CITY HAD ROOM ENOUGH FOR HUNDREDS OF CONCUBINES 
SO MANY SO THAT SOME MIGHT NEVER EVEN MEET THE EMPEROR 
NO ONE KNOWS WHEN LADY CUI WAS FIRST SUMMONED TO YONGLE'S BEDCHAMBER 
ONLY THAT FROM THAT TIME ON SHE BECAME ONE OF HIS GREAT LOVES 
THE HAREM WAS HIGHLY RITUALISED 
THERE WAS A RITUAL CALENDAR TO ENSURE THAT THE EMPEROR WAS HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS 
WITH THE RIGHT WOMAN ON THE RIGHT DAY 
THERE WERE ASTROLOGICAL REASONS 
WHY CERTAIN WOMEN WOULD BE CHOSEN ON PARTICULAR DAYS 
HAVING TO DO WITH THE SOUNDS OF THEIR SURNAMES HAVING TO DO WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR BIRTH 
IT'S IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE THE INTEGRITY OF THE PERSON OF THE EMPEROR 
WAS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO HE IS AFTER ALL 
THE SON OF HEAVEN HE'S A SPIRITUAL BEING IN A. 
IN A SENSE AND SO HIS HAVING SEX ISN'T JUST HAVING SEX 
THERE ARE COSMIC IMPLICATIONS FOR ALL OF THIS 
YOU KNOW IT MUST BE A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE FOR A YOUNG GIRL 
TO BE TAKEN BY THE EMPEROR FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE EMPEROR BEHAVED LIKE HE WAS WELL ABOVE THE HUMAN BEINGS 
BUT I THINK THAT SHE ALSO KNEW THAT IT WAS ONE OF HER REAL CHANCE 
TO PLEASE THE EMPEROR TO BECOME A FAVOURITE 
CONCUBINES WHEN THEY FIRST ARRIVED THEY WERE VERY YOUNG GIRLS AND NORMALLY IN THEIR TEENAGES 
SO THEY WILL BE ENLIGHTENED THE ART OF LOVE MAKING OR 
THE RAIN OF THE CLOUD AS IT IS REFERRED TO POLITELY IN CHINESE 
AND THERE WERE TEXTBOOKS AND THERE WERE ALSO EROTIC PAINTINGS 
TO SHOW THEM HOW TO DO THAT 
SET ADRIFT IN A SEA OF SILK AND FINERY YOUNG VIRGINS 
LIKE LADY CUI HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE PAWNS IN A MUCH BIGGER GAME 
THEIR ROLE WAS NOT JUST TO PROVIDE THE EMPEROR WITH OFFSPRING 
IN THE EYES OF THE COURT AND IN THE EYES OF HEAVEN IT WAS THEIR PURITY AND IMPECCABLE BEHAVIOUR 
THAT WOULD BRING BALANCE AND HARMONY TO THE NEW HEART OF THE EMPIRE THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
BUT IGNORANCE IS BLISS 
AND NO MORE SO WHEN YOU ARE MADE TO WAIT ON A COMFORTABLE BED FOR THE EMPEROR TO SHOW 
WOMEN AND EMPEROR 
ARE AS THE LEFT HAND 
IS TO THE RIGHT 
FROM THE TIME YOU GET UP TO THE TIME YOU GO TO BED 
YOUR ONLY DUTY IS TO LOVE ME 
IF YOU SERVE THE EMPEROR WELL 
THEN THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL PROSPER 
BUT YOU MUST ALWAYS BE HONEST WITH ME 
IT WILL KEEP YOU HERE 
IT WILL KEEP YOU ALIVE 
THE WOMAN WHO IS NOT CAREFUL WILL SEE HER REPUTATION DESTROYED 
AND THEN ONLY DISASTER CAN RESULT 
DISASTER WOULD COME BUT NOT JUST YET 
KEEPING IT AT BAY HAD BECOME A PREOCCUPATION OF YONGLE'S REIGN 
HAVING SNATCHED THE THRONE HIMSELF SO VIOLENTLY HE NOW FESTOONED THE PALACE WITH THE FINAL FLOURISHES 
TALISMANS TO WARD OFF EVIL 
TYPICALLY ONE FINDS AT THE ENDS OF THE CORNERS OF THE ROOF 
MYTHICAL BEASTS THERE'S A KIND OF HORNED DRAGON BEHIND 
AND THEN ANOTHER MYTHICAL FIGURE SEATED ON AN ANIMAL 
BUT THE ONES THAT INTEREST US ARE THOSE FIVE SEATED ANIMALS 
THEY REPRESENT GOOD LUCK AND GOOD FORTUNE BECAUSE IT'S THE ODD NUMBERS 
IN CHINESE NUMEROLOGY IT'S THE ODD NUMBERS THAT ARE THE MAGIC NUMBERS 
FIVE SEVEN NINE 
IN THE DUALITY THAT INFORMS ALMOST ALL OF CHINESE METAPHYSICAL 
OR COSMOLOGICAL THOUGHT THE DUALITY THAT WE CALL YIN AND YANG 
THE FEMALE AND THE MALE THE DARK AND THE BRIGHT AUTUMN AND SPRING 
ALL OF THESE DUALITIES THE ODD NUMBERS ARE ON THE YANG SIDE OF THE EQUATION 
AND ASSOCIATING THE BUILDING THEN WITH THE YANG HELPS TO KEEP EVIL AWAY 
FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER HE FIRST ANNOUNCED HIS DECISION TO SHIFT THE CAPITAL TO BEIJING 
THE EMPEROR WAS AT LAST READY TO PRESENT THE FORBIDDEN CITY TO THE WORLD 
TWO HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE VERSAILLES WAS BUILT 
AND THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE BUCKINGHAM PALACE 
THOUSANDS OF FOREIGN DIGNITARIES WERE INVITED TO BEIJING TO SEE THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
THE SIGHT THAT GREETED THEM WAS QUITE SIMPLY JAW DROPPING 
THE VISITORS WOULD BE MADE TO WALK HALF A MILE THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF GIANT GATES 
THAT CULMINATED IN THE TOWERING THREE SIDED MERIDIAN GATE 
ONLY THEN WOULD THEY BE ADMITTED INTO THE VAST CEREMONIAL PLAZAS 
THAT SPREAD BEFORE THE HALL OF SUPREME HARMONY 
EVEN THEN HALF OF THE PALACE COMPLEX WAS KEPT OFF LIMITS 
NO ONE BUT THE EMPEROR AND HIS ENTOURAGE OF EUNUCHS 
COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE CLOISTERED WORLD OF THE IMPERIAL HAREM 
EVERYTHING IT SEEMED AUGURED WELL 
EVEN THE DAY PICKED FOR THE OPENING CEREMONY WAS OF THE HIGHEST ASTROLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE 
THE JIAZI DAY 
THE CHINESE CALENDAR IS ORGANISED UPON A SIXTY DAY AND A SIXTY YEAR CYCLE 
AND THE BEGINNING OF THAT CYCLE WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE JIAZI DAY 
IS THE MOST AUSPICIOUS DAY IN THE ENTIRE CYCLE 
THAT SHOWED THAT HE WAS BEGINNING A NEW ERA 
AND HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS CONTROLLING THE CYCLES OF TIME 
THIS WAS THE CULMINATION OF YONGLE'S REIGN 
EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS WOULD CELEBRATE THE GLORY OF HIS FINEST HOUR 
THERE GATHERED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN 
WHILE NEARLY TWO THOUSAND MUSICIANS STOOD 
SINGING IN CONCERT AND CHANTING THE PRAISES OF THE EMPEROR 
THEY BEGAN TO STRIKE ON DRUMS 
AND PLAYED UPON TRUMPETS CYMBALS FLUTES AND CONE SHELLS 
THEN THE THREE DOORS WERE FLUNG OPEN AND THE PEOPLE RUSHED INSIDE 
AT THE FOOT OF HIS THRONE THEY PAID HOMAGE TO HIS MAJESTY 
THE ONE TRUE SON OF HEAVEN 
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRWAY STOOD THE YONGLE EMPEROR HIMSELF 
FLANKED BY HIS CONSORTS HIS CONCUBINES 
HIS FAVOURITES MEMBERS OF THE COURT 
MEMBERS OF THE BUREAUCRACY MEMBERS OF THE IMPERIAL FAMILY 
ALL THERE TO CELEBRATE THE MOMENT 
WHILE WE HERE STANDING IN THE COURTYARD BELOW HIM 
WOULD FACE HIM AND THEN CAREFULLY KNEEL DOWN 
AND KNOCK OUR HEADS UPON THE GROUND THREE TIMES 
TO SIGNAL OUR REVERENCE NOT ONLY FOR HEAVEN BUT FOR THE EMPEROR HIMSELF 
TO BE ABLE TO STAND AT THE TOP OF THAT TERRACE 
AND LOOK DOWN AND TO HAVE THIS LARGE AUDIENCE IN FRONT OF HIM 
CONGRATULATING HIM ON WHAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED 
MUST HAVE BEEN FOR HIM PERSONALLY 
A SIGNAL THAT WHAT HE HAD DONE WAS RIGHT 
THE SUCCESS IN AND OF ITSELF WAS A MARK THAT HEAVEN APPROVED OF WHAT HE HAD DONE 
BUT THE BLESSING OF HEAVEN COULD NOT BE COUNTED ON FOR MUCH LONGER 
IN THE COMING WEEKS OUTSIDE THE PALACE WALLS THE CITY OF BEIJING CONTINUED 
TO HOST THE THOUSANDS OF FOREIGN AMBASSADORS WHO HAD JOURNEYED SO FAR FOR THE OPENING CEREMONY 
BUT INSIDE THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
ITS RESIDENTS BEGAN TO LUXURIATE IN THEIR NEW SURROUNDINGS 
BEAUTIFUL DELICATE AND SEEMINGLY CAREFREE 
THE CONCUBINES HAD NEVER KNOWN SUCH OPULENCE 
THE MING RECORDS TELL HOW DEPARTMENTS RUN BY EUNUCHS CATERED TO THEIR EVERY WHIM 
THERE WAS A DEPARTMENT OF ENTERTAINMENT FOR FESTIVALS AND PARTIES 
A DIRECTORATE OF OUTFITTING PROVIDING TENTS CUSHIONS AND TABLECLOTHS 
AN IMPERIAL WINE ROOM A BUREAU OF SILVERWARE 
A DEPARTMENT OF THE BATHHOUSE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH STEAMING WATER 
THERE WAS EVEN A DEPARTMENT OF TOILET PAPER 
BUT THAT WASN'T ALL 
FOR YEARS NOW THE VASSAL STATES AROUND CHINA 
AND FAR BEYOND HAD PAID HOMAGE TO THE EMPIRE BY GIVING GIFTS 
BY FAR THE MOST EXOTIC AS THE COURTIER XIA YUANJI REMEMBERED 
WAS THE GIRAFFE NOW LIVING IN THE PALACE MENAGERIE 
LONG BELIEVED TO BE A MYTHICAL BEAST AKIN TO THE UNICORN THE QILIN 
AN ENVOY FROM BENGAL CAME TO THE COURT AND PRESENTED TO THE EMPEROR AN EXTRAORDINARY GIFT 
A QILIN AND THE COURT WAS ALL IN A FLUTTER 
ITS VISAGE WAS MYSTICAL AND DIVINE 
ITS MAGICAL FUR SHINY AND CLEAN 
ITS STAR LIKE PUPIL DAZZLED THE EYE 
WE ALL KNEW THAT THE QILIN WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY ANIMAL 
THAT WAS SAID WOULD APPEAR ONLY IF A SAINTLY EMPEROR WAS ON THE THRONE 
THIS IS WHY BARBARIANS HAVE CLIMBED MOUNTAINS 
BUT FOR THE CONCUBINES IT WAS A CLOISTERED PLAYGROUND 
THOUGH THEY WANTED FOR NOTHING THEY WERE NEVER TO LEAVE THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
CAGED INSIDE SOME DEVELOPED WHAT WERE KNOWN AS VEGETARIAN AFFAIRS 
WITH THE EUNUCHS 
I THINK PROBABLY IN MANY CASES 
THERE WAS A VERY CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EUNUCHS AND THE CONCUBINES 
THESE EUNUCHS LOOKED AFTER EVERY PHYSICAL DESIRE THAT THEY COULD POSSIBLY WANT 
AND SINCE IT WAS VERY UNLIKELY THAT THEY HAD VERY MUCH CONTACT WITH THE EMPEROR 
THESE WERE THE ONLY MEN OR HALF MEN THAT THEY WOULD HAVE CONTACT WITH 
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING AT ALL 
THAT THEY WOULD BUILD UP EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS 
WHICH OF COURSE IF THEY WENT TOO FAR THAT COULD LEAD TO TROUBLE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR EUNUCH HANDLERS 
BUT TRAGICALLY IT WASN'T ALL FUN AND GAMES 
IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THE PARANOID EMPEROR HAD CREATED A MONSTROUS SECRET POLICE MACHINE KNOWN AS THE EASTERN DEPOT 
TO ADVISE HIM OF ANY THREAT TO THE THRONE 
IT WAS RUN BY SENIOR EUNUCHS WHO WOULD SPY ON EVERYONE EVEN THEIR OWN KIND 
THE OFFICIAL MING TEXTS MAKE NO MENTION OF WHAT HIS SPIES DISCOVERED 
BUT BURIED AWAY IN A LITTLE KNOWN ACCOUNT OF THE TIME WRITTEN BY ENVOYS FROM KOREA 
THE NATIVE LAND OF THE CONCUBINE LADY CUI IS A SPINE TINGLING TALE 
IN THE DAYS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPENING CEREMONY 
WITH CHINA'S FOREIGN GUESTS STILL ALL CAMPED OUT IN THE CITY 
WORD WAS DISPATCHED TO YONGLE THAT ONE OF HIS FAVOURITE CONCUBINES 
HAD BEEN CAUGHT CAVORTING WITH A EUNUCH 
THE EMPEROR FLEW INTO A RAGE 
HE ROUNDED UP ALL THE SERVANTS AND HAD THEM QUESTIONED 
THEY WERE TERRIFIED 
THEY BEGAN TO BABBLE THAT THEY WERE GUILTY 
AND THEY WERE COOKING UP A PLOT TO HAVE HIM KILLED 
ONLY ONE MAN HAD THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO THE EMPEROR 
RIGHT TO HIS FACE HE SAID I AM OLD AND WEAK AND WHEN I WAS YOUNG I WAS A MONK 
WHY SHOULD I NOW BE BLAMED 
BUT HIS CRIES FELL ON DEAF EARS 
IF INDEED THERE WAS SOME KIND OF LIAISON GOING ON 
BETWEEN EUNUCHS AND CONCUBINES 
THIS THREATENED THE MANHOOD OF THE EMPEROR 
BUT ALSO POSED A POLITICAL THREAT 
TO HIM AND IT IS NOT THEREFORE SURPRISING 
THAT IF THIS GOT OUT OF HAND 
THEN THE EMPEROR WOULD BE EXTREMELY ANGRY 
AND WOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION 
AWAY FROM PRYING EYES THE EMPEROR DID NOT HESITATE TO ACT 
SO THE KOREAN CHRONICLES TELL 
THE CONCUBINES WERE QUIETLY ROUNDED UP FROM THEIR RESIDENCES AT THE BACK OF THE PALACE 
AND MARCHED TO THEIR DEATH 
ONE OF THE PALACE LADIES LADY WANG 
DESPERATELY TRIED TO SAVE HERSELF BY IMPLICATING A NUMBER OF OTHERS 
MY GOOD FRIEND LADY LI WHO WAS FAR MORE COLLECTED THAN SHE WAS TOLD HER 
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DIE 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO TAKE OTHERS WITH YOU 
I SHALL DIE ALONE SHE SAID 
AND SHE DID 
WITHOUT BLAMING A SOUL 
ALTOGETHER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PALACE LADIES 
SERVANTS AND EUNUCHS WERE EXECUTED THAT DAY 
HOW THE CONCUBINES WERE EXECUTED IS DESCRIBED IN THE KOREAN CHRONICLES 
THE WORDS ARE HARD TO TRANSLATE EXACTLY 
BUT THEY MEAN RENT RIPPED SPLIT TORN TO SHREDS 
THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE MASSACRE IN YONGLE'S OWN OFFICIAL RECORDS 
IT SEEMS SO SOON AFTER THE FANFARE OF THE OPENING CEREMONY 
HE DID HIS BEST TO SWEEP THE WHOLE SORDID AFFAIR UNDER THE CARPET 
WHEN YOU HAVE AMBASSADORS FROM SIXTY OR MORE COUNTRIES AROUND 
AND THEY'RE THERE FOR FIVE MONTHS 
THEN THE EMPEROR HAS TO SHOW THAT HE'S IN COMPLETE CHARGE OF HIS PALACE 
AND ANY WHIFF OF SCANDAL COULD CAUSE SERIOUS TROUBLE 
THEY WOULD HAVE TRIED TO SUPPRESS ALL NEWS ABOUT THIS 
AND WOULD HAVE NOT WANTED A SINGLE WORD TO HAVE LEAKED OUT 
BUT NEWS DID LEAK OUT TO ENVOYS FROM KOREA THAT MANY OF THEIR COUNTRYWOMEN HAD BEEN MURDERED 
LADY CUI HAD BEEN SPARED ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS ILL 
AND HAD BEEN RECUPERATING IN THE OLD PALACE AT NANJING 
BUT FORTUNE WOULD NOT LOOK SO FAVOURABLY ON THE EMPEROR FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE 
JUST ONE HUNDRED DAYS AFTER THE OPENING CEREMONY 
SOMETHING UNEARTHLY WAS ABOUT TO STRIKE AT THE VERY CORE OF HIS BELOVED PALACE 
THE THREE MAIN HALLS OF THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
THE LARGEST OF THE THREE 
AT THE SOUTHERN END OF THE PLATFORM IS THE BASILICA FOR REVERING HEAVEN 
BEHIND IT IN THE MIDDLE IS A SMALLER BUILDING 
THAT HE CALLED THE FLORIATE CANOPY 
AND BEHIND IT FURTHER STILL THAT IS AT THE NORTHERN END OF THIS PLATFORM 
IS THE BASILICA FOR AH IT'S DIFFICULT TO TRANSLATE THESE THINGS 
IT'S THE BASILICA FOR BEING MINDFUL OF ONE'S PERSON 
IT REFERS REALLY I THINK TO A KIND OF MORAL CULTIVATION 
AND COMMUNICATES THE MESSAGE THAT THE EMPEROR WAS NOT ONLY CONCERNED 
WITH THE MORALITY OF HIS EMPIRE AT LARGE BUT WITH HIS OWN BEHAVIOUR 
IF YOU HAD A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THESE THREE PALACES 
YOU'D SEE THAT THE THREE BUILDINGS TOGETHER 
SEEM TO FORM A CHINESE CHARACTER WRITTEN LIKE THIS 
THIS IS THE CHARACTER THAT STANDS FOR THE WORD THAT MEANS EARTH 
THE REASON FOR THIS WE THINK 
IS THAT THEN THE THREE BUILDINGS TAKEN TOGETHER SYMBOLISE EARTH 
BUT EARTH AS A COSMIC FORCE AT THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE 
IF THESE THREE BUILDINGS WERE YONGLE'S DIRECT LINK TO HEAVEN 
THEN IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT THOSE SUCH AS LADY CUI 
INTERPRETED WHAT HAPPENED THE VERY NIGHT AFTER THE MASSACRE 
AS THE VENGEANCE OF THE GODS 
THERE WAS SUCH DEEP SORROW IN THE PALACE 
THE THUNDER SHOOK THE THREE GREAT HALLS IN THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
LIGHTNING STRUCK THEM 
AND AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS OF TOIL THEY BURNT TO THE GROUND 
THE BLAZE LIT UP THE ENTIRE CITY 
SO THE WORDS OF THE ANCIENT TEXTS RECORD 
FLAMES ENGULFED THE WOODEN BEAMS AND PILLARS OF THE PALACE 
AS IF A HUNDRED THOUSAND TORCHES HAD BEEN LIT 
LEAPING FROM THE HALLS TO THE PARLOURS AND CHAMBERS 
REDUCING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BUILDINGS TO ASHES 
BURNING SCORES OF MEN AND WOMEN ALIVE 
AND THEY ALL BURNT TO THE GROUND 
ALL WITHIN THE PALACE WERE OVERJOYED BY THIS EVENT 
THINKING THAT THE EMPEROR WOULD SURELY BE FRIGHTENED 
BY THIS CHANGE WROUGHT BY HEAVEN 
WE ALL HOPE THE EMPEROR WILL SEE WHAT THIS WAS' 
A WARNING THAT HE SHOULD CHANGE HIS WAYS 
THEN HE SHOULD CEASE HIS CRUELTY 
BUT HE DID NOT 
HE COULD NOT 
HE CONTINUED TO BE CRUEL 
HE COULD NOT CHANGE 
NOT NOW 
AFTER LIGHTNING STRUCK THE THREE PALACES 
AND THEY BURNT TO THE GROUND 
YONGLE ISSUED A STATEMENT IN WHICH HE WORRIED ABOUT HIS GOVERNMENT 
AND QUESTIONED WHY THIS GREAT CATASTROPHE HAD HAPPENED 
THE STATEMENT BEGINS WITH A REMARKABLE CONFESSION 
HE SAYS 
I AM FRIGHTENED TO THE VERY CORE OF MY BEING 
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
I HUMBLY BOW TO HEAVEN'S WILL 
THE THREE GREAT HALLS OF MY PALACE LIE IN ASHES 
IN MY HEART I AM LOST 
I'M SHAKEN AND FEARFUL 
IT WAS ALWAYS MY INTENTION TO RESPECT HEAVEN AND TO WORSHIP THE GODS 
HAVE I NOW FAILED YOU 
NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO 
HE THEN ASKS ALOUD RHETORICALLY IF YOU LIKE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS 
HAS MY RULE GONE ASTRAY 
HAVE I LET CORRUPT MEN HOLD POWER WHILE THE WORTHY HAVE HIDDEN AWAY 
SO THAT I CAN NO LONGER DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL 
HAVE MY PUNISHMENTS BEEN TOO HARSH 
DID I PUNISH THOSE WHO WERE NOT GUILTY 
DID I OPPRESS MY PEOPLE AND BRING ABOUT THIS DISASTER 
DEPRIVING THEM OF THE RIGHT TO WORK FOR THEMSELVES 
HAVE I TAXED THEM TOO HEAVILY WORKED THEM TOO HARD 
DEMANDED TOO MUCH SO THAT THEIR STRENGTH HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED 
I'VE BEEN BLIND 
I HAVE BEEN BLIND 
YONGLE HAD CLAWED HIS WAY TO THE DIZZY HEIGHTS OF POWER 
NOW HE'D SUNK TO THE LOWEST POINT OF HIS REIGN 
THE PALACE THAT HE HAD COVERED WITH LUCKY CHARMS SEEMED DAMNED 
THE COFFERS WERE EMPTY 
BUT UNWISELY HE SOUGHT A SOLUTION IN THE ONE THING HE DID BEST 
WAR 
A NEW CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MONGOLS UP TO THE NORTH OF CHINA 
WOULD PROVE TO HIS PEOPLE HE WAS STILL THEIR INDEFATIGABLE LEADER 
WE MUST QUICKLY FIND A REMEDY TO THE SITUATION 
TRY TO CHANGE OURSELVES AND GO BACK TO FULFILLING HEAVEN'S INTENTION 
MINISTER IS THERE SILVER ENOUGH IN THE TREASURY FOR WAR 
SIRE 
I HAVE RECEIVED GREAT FAVOURS FROM YOUR MAJESTY 
AND SO I CANNOT FAIL TO ADMONISH YOU EVEN ON PAIN OF DEATH 
SO MANY MISFORTUNES AND FAULTS HAVE BEFALLEN US IN SUCH SWIFT SUCCESSION 
YOUR PEOPLE ARE EXHAUSTED 
EVEN YOUR MAJESTY HAS HAD LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO REST 
SIR YOU ARE UNWELL 
I BEG OF YOU IF YOU MUST HAVE A WAR 
SEND YOUR GENERALS ON THIS CAMPAIGN BUT DO NOT GO YOURSELF 
PUT THE MINISTER OF REVENUE IN THE CARE OF THE DIRECTORATE 
OF THE PALACE EUNUCHS 
CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTY 
LEAVE EACH MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY WITH ONE COTTON SUIT 
AND SOMETHING TO EAT WITH 
IT'S REALLY QUITE EXTRAORDINARY THAT YOU COULD HAVE OFFICIALS WHO COULD STAND UP 
AND BE WILLING TO CRITICISE TO HIS FACE 
A MAN OF THAT POWER AND THAT PERSEVERANCE 
KNOWING FULL WELL 
THAT HE HAD JUST TO WINK HIS EYE 
AND YOUR LIFE COULD BE ENDED 
RIGHT FROM THE START THE LOYAL MINISTER XIA YUANJI 
HAD THROWN HIS FULL WEIGHT BEHIND THE EMPEROR'S COLOSSAL BUILDING PROJECT 
NOW FOR DARING TO SPEAK OUT 
HE WAS FLUNG INTO THE PRISON RUN BY YONGLE'S EUNUCH SECRET POLICE 
THESE ARE HIS WORDS 
AND SO HERE I AM 
FROM TIME TO TIME THE EMPEROR SENDS IN A EUNUCH TO CHECK UP ON ME 
SOMETIMES THEY ASKED THE EMPEROR USED TO TREAT YOU SO WELL 
BUT NOW HE IMPRISONS YOU AND TREATS YOU SO SEVERELY 
DON'T YOU RESENT HIM 
AND I REPLY 
WIND RAIN FROST AND DEW 
THEY ALL JUST TEACH YOU TO BE BETTER MEN 
UP ON THE MONGOLIAN BORDER THE EMPEROR'S ARMY PREPARED FOR WAR 
BUT THE SNEAKING BELIEF THAT HEAVEN HAD FORSAKEN HIM 
HAD LEFT YONGLE A BROKEN MAN 
HE HAD RUN OUT OF ENERGY AND RUN OUT OF FAITH 
IN DESPERATION HE TURNED TO MYSTICAL MEDICINES 
MUSKS AND LONGNOW TO CURE HIS SICKENED SOUL 
IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE 
ON THE TWELFTH OF AUGUST ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR 
YONGLE THE THIRD EMPEROR OF THE MING DYNASTY DIED 
IF AS THE RECORDS SUGGEST 
THE ILLNESS FOLLOWS CLOSELY UPON THE FIRES' 
I THINK HE IN A WAY 
INTERNALISED ALL OF THAT 
HE HELD HIMSELF HE DID HOLD HIMSELF RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED 
I THINK THAT THIS THE REFLECTION THE SORT OF SELF INVESTIGATION 
THE SELF QUESTIONING THE SELF DOUBT 
ALL OF THAT I THINK LED TO A KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL IMBALANCE 
AND SO THE ILLNESS WAS JUST A PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF THIS DOUBT 
THE EUNUCH HAI SHOU BROUGHT THE EMPEROR'S BODY BACK TO THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
TO DRESS AND PREPARE HIM FOR BURIAL IN THE GREAT MING TOMBS 
THEY HAD BEEN SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED OUTSIDE BEIJING 
YONGLE HAD USURPED THE THRONE BUT ASSURED THE RISE OF THE DYNASTY 
HE IS TODAY REMEMBERED AS BOTH THE BEST AND THE WORST OF IMPERIAL CHINA 
A TIRELESS OVER ACHIEVER AND A DESPOTIC TYRANT 
IN THE DARK WORLD OF THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
WHERE LIFE COULD BE SNUFFED OUT IN AN INSTANT 
LADY CUI HAD SUCCESSFULLY OUTLIVED HER HUSBAND THE EMPEROR 
BUT THERE IS A SICKENING FOOTNOTE 
IN THE MARRIAGE VOWS OF THE FAVOURED IMPERIAL CONCUBINE 
SHE MUST NEVER GIVE HERSELF TO ANOTHER MAN 
I THINK THROUGHOUT HISTORY THERE WERE DIFFERENT RULES IN REGARDING THIS ISSUE 
BEFORE WHEN THE EMPEROR DIED A WOMAN 
THAT HIS CONCUBINES WERE FORCED TO SHAVE OFF THEIR HAIR 
AND TO BECOME NUNS IN A MONASTERY 
IN SOME CASES A WOMAN ASKED TO KILL THEMSELF 
OR TO BE BURIED TOGETHER TO SERVE HIM IN THE AFTERLIFE 
LADY CUI HAD BEEN PREPARING HERSELF ALL DAY 
TO MEET HER HUSBAND ONE LAST TIME IN DEATH 
ALONG WITH YONGLE'S FIFTEEN FAVOURITE CONCUBINES AND THEIR SERVANT GIRLS 
SHE WAS ESCORTED TO A QUIET HALL IN THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
WHERE NOOSES OF WHITE SILK HAD BEEN HUNG FROM THE PAINTED TIMBERS 
SHE WAS JUST THIRTY YEARS OLD 
AFTER YONGLE'S DEATH HIS SON THE NEW EMPEROR HONGXI 
DECIDED TO ABANDON THE ILL FATED PALACE AND MOVE THE CAPITAL BACK TO NANJING 
BUT BEFORE HE COULD JUST ONE YEAR INTO HIS REIGN HE DIED 
THE PALACE IT SEEMED WAS CURSED 
THE THREE GREAT HALLS LAY IN RUINS 
FOR FIFTEEN YEARS UNTIL THE DECISION WAS TAKEN TO REBUILD THEM 
THE FORBIDDEN CITY WOULD SERVE IN TOTAL TWENTY FOUR EMPERORS UNTIL NINETEEN ELEVEN 
WHEN REVOLUTIONARIES STORMED THE PALACE TO END IMPERIAL RULE 
WHEN YONGLE OPENED THE FORBIDDEN CITY 
HE SHOWCASED THE MIGHT OF HIS EMPIRE AND DAZZLED THE WORLD 
NOW AFTER SIX HUNDRED YEARS 
WITH THE COMING OLYMPICS ALL EYES ARE TURNING TO BEIJING ONCE MORE 
CHINA THE NEW SUPERPOWER 
IS COMMANDING THE WORLD'S ATTENTION ONCE AGAIN
