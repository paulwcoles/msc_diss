YOU'RE BACK WELL IT ONLY NEEDS THE TWO OF US THIS IS POINTS OF VIEW 
AND ONCE AGAIN I'M DISGUISING MYSELF AS A PROFESSIONAL PRESENTER 
I'VE BLAGGED MY WAY INTO THE B. B. C. NERVE CENTRE 
TO TELL THEM WHAT YOU'RE THINKING 
YOU'RE ON OUR MESSAGEBOARD THE E. MAIL EVEN USING 
AN ANCIENT FORM OF MESSAGE DELIVERY KNOWN AS THE ROYAL MAIL 
BUT WHERE DOES IT GET US 
IT'S A THEME THAT COMES BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 
WITH THE LICENCE FEE YOU PAY FOR THE GOODS BEFORE YOU'VE INSPECTED THEM 
IF THEY'RE CRACKED OR BROKEN DO YOU GET A REFUND 
I HEARD YOUR ANSWER FROM HERE 
SO THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO TEST THE SYSTEM TOGETHER 
LET'S START WITH B. B. C. THREE 
THEY HAD A GOOD NIGHT AT THE BAFTAS WITH GAVIN AND STACEY 
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON TODAY 
IT'S THE NUMBER OF ONE OFF EPISODES OF BRAND NEW DRAMAS 
IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS THEY'VE HAD SIX 
COME AGAIN SIX 
WHAT THAT MEANS IS SIX TIMES YOU GET EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING 
AND SIX TIMES FOOF IT'S GONE 
NOT A TRACE OF THAT DRAMA YOU WERE MAYBE STARTING TO LOOK FORWARD TO 
SO IS B. B. C. THREE THE EXERCISE YARD FOR OTHER CHANNELS 
ARE VIEWERS PART OF SOME CRUEL EXPERIMENT IN TANTALISATION 
MARK JOHN FROM NEATH IN WALES ENJOYED BEING HUMAN 
AND THEN THAT VANISHED TOO HE CAME TO B. B. C. H. Q. TO GET THE ANSWERS 
BEING HUMAN WAS A PILOT THAT'S THE T. V. VERSION OF A TESTER 
ON THE PERFUME COUNTER THIS DRAMA WAS BASED ON 
A VAMPIRE A WEREWOLF AND A GHOST 
STAG PARTY 
BEING HUMAN WAS A PROGRAMME I OBVIOUSLY REALLY ENJOYED 
I FELT LEFT IN LIMBO 
BY THE ENDING 
AND THE FACT THAT IT WASN'T MADE CLEAR 
THAT IT WAS JUST A ONE OFF PILOT YES 
AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY WHY I WROTE IN TO POINTS OF VIEW FOR AN ANSWER 
I HOPE OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN 
WENT SOME WAY TO EXPLAINING WE WERE JUST DOING A SEASON OF SIX PILOTS 
SIX SINGLES 
BUT CLEARLY THAT DIDN'T QUITE COME ACROSS TO PEOPLE 
IT WAS ABOUT VERY QUICKLY DOING SIX BIG NEW FRESH TITLES 
FOR B. B. C. THREE AND SEEING WHICH ONES WORKED 
ACROSS THE PILOTING SEASON WE'VE HAD TIME TO REFINE AND THINK ABOUT 
WHAT WORK WE'D WANT TO DO WITH THE SCRIPT 
WE WOULD IN THE CASE OF BEING HUMAN DEVELOP THE CHARACTERS FURTHER 
OBVIOUSLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT MADE IN TO A SERIES ONES THAT A POSSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE 
I LOVED BEING HUMAN I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCH A FRESH IDEA 
FROM TOBY WHITHOUSE WHO'S THE WRITER 
UM JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW DOING EXTRAORDINARY LINES 
IN A FLAT SHARE THIS IS MAD ISN'T IT 
WEREWOLF GHOST AND VAMPIRE BUT YEAH THE GREAT NEWS 
IS THAT IT IS GOING TO BE RECOMMISSIONED 
OH NOW I'M STUMPED 
THAT'S GOOD 
I'VE JUST HAD A MEETING WITH B. B. C. THREE'S JULIE GARDNER 
ABOUT BEING HUMAN THAT WAS A PROGRAMME ON B. B. C. THREE 
REALLY HAPPY WITH THE RESPONSE 
AND REALLY HAPPY THAT BEING HUMAN'S GOING TO BE MADE IN TO A SERIES 
HOW ABOUT THAT 
CAN WE CHALK IT UP ON OUR NEW POINTS OF VIEW SCOREBOARD 
MARK JOHN AND OTHERS LIKED IT SO IT WILL BECOME A SERIES 
YES WE'RE ON OUR WAY 
NOW A QUESTION ABOUT QUESTION TIME 
TOM JACKSON IS ONE OF OURS 
AN ORDINARY GUY WHO WATCHES POINTS OF VIEW 
AND WANTS TO BE IN THE Q. T. AUDIENCE HE KEEPS APPLYING 
AND HE NEVER MAKES IT WHY WHAT'S GOING ON 
WHOSE RED PEN KEEPS PUTTING A LINE THROUGH TOM'S NAME 
I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW THE AUDIENCE IS SELECTED 
TO TAKE PART 
DO THEY HAVE INFORMATION ON ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PHONED 
DOES THE PROGRAMME MAKER 
PREFER GROUPS WITH POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS AFFILIATIONS 
RATHER THAN AN INDIVIDUAL 
I'M SURE I'M NOT ALONE IN WONDERING HOW THE PEOPLE ARE SELECTED 
WE PUT TOM'S CONCERNS TO QUESTION TIME WHO HAD THIS RESPONSE 
LAST WEEK A STAR WAS BORN 
JENNIE BOND NO WAIT FOR THE END OF THE SENTENCE 
TRIGGERED THIS REACTION FROM VIEWER JANE LONGHURST 
NO 
NO NO 
THE STAR OF COURSE WAS JANE'S CUSHION 
BUT BASICALLY TO PARAPHRASE 
JANE THINKS JENNIE SHOULDN'T BE PRESENTING GREAT BRITISH MENU 
BECAUSE SHE'S HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO HER JENNIE BOND NESS 
AND WONDERS IF JENNIE'S NOW ONLY DOING THE COMMENTARY 
BECAUSE SHE JANE HAS WON THE ARGUMENT 
LET'S HEAR THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE 
ONE OF THE DECISIONS WE TOOK WAS TO GO IN TO A MORE DOCUMENTARY STYLE 
NOW AS FOR THE TONE THE TONE IS WITTY 
IRREVERENT FUNNY AND WARM 
AND HOPEFULLY VERY BRITISH 
JUST LIKE GREAT BRITISH MENU 
BRADBURY ON BOND NOT FOR TURNING 
BUT BE INSPIRED BY JANE AND THE CUSHION 
AS THEY GOT NOTICED AND THEY GOT ANSWERS

HOW'S THIS ONE AN EAGLE EYED NATURAL HISTORY JUNKIE 
CAROLINE CLARK UNCOVERED I. D. FRAUD ON THE B. B. C. 
IT INVOLVES MEERKATS WHO GOT THEIR BREAK 
ON THE SHOW NATURAL WORLD FIVE YEARS AGO 
HOW THEY WERE LOVED 
SO MUCH SO THEY GOT A SPIN OFF SERIES OUT OF IT 
CALLED MEERKAT MANOR 
NOW THE MEERKATS ARE BACK 
THE NEW PROGRAMME WILD TALES 
FEATURES A YOUNG MEERKAT CALLED ROONEY 
AND HIS ANTICS AMONGST THE ANTHILLS 
THESE STORIES RECREATE THEIR ROLLERCOASTER LIVES 
HERE ON WILD TALES' 
BUT CAROLINE IS A KEEN WILDLIFE WATCHER 
WITH TWENTY TO TWENTY VISION 
AND SHE NOTICED SOMETHING ODD ABOUT THE FOOTAGE OF LITTLE ROONEY 
IT SHOWED A CLIP OF THIS MEERKAT PUP BEING BITTEN BY AN ADDER 
WHEN IT RAN INTO A HOLE TO HIDE FROM A GOSHAWK 
AND SUDDENLY IT CAME BACK ON AND SHE SAID IT WAS CALLED ROONEY 
AND I THOUGHT NO THAT'S NOT RIGHT BUT I KEPT WATCHING AND I THOUGHT 
THAT'S NOT RIGHT THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT NAME 
UNBELIEVABLY THE MAKERS OF WILD TALES RECUT THE OLD FOOTAGE 
GAVE ARNIE A NEW NAME AND HOPED NOBODY WOULD NOTICE 
IT WAS ARNIE WHO WAS FIRST IN TO THE HOLE 
AND HE STUMBLED IN TO REAL TROUBLE IN THE DARKNESS' 
OH NO LOOK AT ROONEY HE'S LIMPING 
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE 
PLAGIARISING OTHER SHOWS BOOKS FILMS OR WHATEVER 
AND YET THEY SEEM TO BE DOING IT TO THEIR OWN SHOW 
A YEAR AGO THIS TYPE OF THING 
WOULD HAVE BROUGHT DOWN THE WHOLE B. B. C. EXECUTIVE BOARD 
BUT THE RESPONSE TO THIS BIT OF FAKERY WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT 
WILD TALES WENT OUT TO BRING THE BEST OF THE WILDLIFE MATERIAL 
THAT WE'VE SHOT WITHIN THE NATURAL HISTORY UNIT OVER TIME 
AND REPACKAGE IT FOR A YOUNGER AUDIENCE 
WHILST NOT DECEIVING THEM ABOUT THE TYPE OF STORIES THAT GO ON 
WE FELT THAT BECAUSE WE WERE TELLING THE STORY OF MEERKATS 
USING NUMBERS OF BITS OF FOOTAGE 
WE WERE MAKING THE ANALOGY THIS TIME THAT THE MEERKATS 
WERE A FOOTBALL TEAM AND THAT FOOTBALL TEAM ANALOGY 
RAN THROUGHOUT THE SERIES SO WE FELT THAT ROONEY WAS A BETTER NAME 
TO NAME OUR STAR LEAD CHARACTER OF A MEERKAT 
THE MEERKATS THEMSELVES I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW EACH OTHER 
AS ROONEY OR ARNIE IT'S PROBABLY CHEEP CHEEP OR SOMETHING 
BABY ROONEY AKA ARNIE 
IS THE TOM CRUISE OF THE MEERKAT WORLD 
SO PERFECT SO CHISELLED HIS AGENT ALWAYS GET THE CALL FIRST 
WE HAVE TO HOPE IT'S THAT 
AND NOT ANYONE PLAYING FAST AND LOOSE WITH BROADCASTING ETHICS 
THE WHOLE ORGANISATION HAS BEEN RETRAINED 
IN EXACTLY THESE KINDS OF ISSUES SINCE LAST YEAR 
SO DOES THAT MAKE YOU MORE TRUSTING OF WHAT YOU SEE ON THE B. B. C. 
DO THE MEERKATS MATTER LET US KNOW 
ANTHROPOMORPHISING IS A LONG WORD 
MEANING GIVING ANIMALS HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS 
OR PUTTING THEM IN SOAP OPERA STYLE STORIES 
AS IF THEY ARE LIVING HUMAN LIVES JUST AS THEY DID WITH YOUNG ROONEY 
BUT AS OUR CAUTIONARY TALE SHOWED IT CAN GET OUT OF HAND 
LESSON LEARNED WELL THIS WEEK THE NATURAL WORLD ABOUT HYENAS 
WAS BILLED AS A WILDLIFE STORY OF SHAKESPEARIAN PROPORTIONS 
HER DESTINY AS QUEEN HAS BEEN DENIED 
NOW HER POSITION IN THE CLAN WILL BE DECIDED BY WHO HER ALLIES ARE 
ANIMALS BEHAVING LIKE HUMANS 
MOST OF TELEVISION IS THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WAKING THE DEAD THIS WEEK TOO 
THE B. B. C. ONE PATHOLOGY SERIES 
WHERE IS HE NOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
YOU WANT SOME OF THIS PLEASE GIVE IT TO ME YOU WANT SOME OF THIS YES 
YOU WANT THIS 
OH NO 
OVER ON B. B. C. FOUR 
THEY'VE GOT A DIFFERENT TAKE ON THE CRIMINAL FRATERNITY 
HEIST IS THE DIGITAL CHANNEL'S LATEST FORAY IN TO COMEDY 
PART OF THE MEDIEVAL SEASON 
ONLY ON B. B. C. FOUR WOULD THEY HAVE A MEDIEVAL SEASON 
IT FOLLOWS AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK IN TO WESTMINSTER ABBEY 
THERE IS A WEAK SPOT 
THE GRAVEYARD 
AND THE EARTH THERE IS NICE AND SOFT BECAUSE IT GETS DUG UP SO MUCH 
WE CAN GO DOWN THROUGH THE CORPSES AND STRAIGHT ACROSS 
USING THE WOOD FROM THE COFFINS AS SUPPORTS 
B. B. C. THREE HAS NOT YET HAD A MEDIEVAL SEASON 
WHICH I GUESS WOULD BE ITS LOOK AT THE LATE NINETIES 
BUT THEY'VE BEEN ON DIET AND BODY IMAGE LATELY 
ON MONDAY NIGHTS GLAMOUR GIRLS IS CLOSELY FOLLOWED 
BY NATALIE CASSIDY'S DIET SECRETS SO HOW DOES NATALIE FARE 
WITH A TOUGH AUDIENCE OF DIET AND FITNESS INSTRUCTORS 
AND THEIR CLIENTS 
OUR TRAVELLING TALKING POINT 
PARKED UP AT A MIDLANDS' LEISURE AND FITNESS CLASS 
THE PROGRAMME WAS MUSIC TO MY EARS ACTUALLY 
I'VE BEEN COACHING FOR YEARS NOW 
THAT FAD DIETS QUICK FIXES FOR LONG TERM WINS JUST DOESN'T WORK 
ANOTHER CELEB USES THE CHOCOLATE CAKE DIET 
SHE STARES AT A CHOCOLATE CAKE FOR HALF AN HOUR 
HAS A GLASS OF WATER THEN WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM 
I THINK THE WAY THE PROGRAMME WAS MADE WAS EXCELLENT 
BECAUSE IT WAS AIMED AT A YOUNGER GROUP THE TARGET AUDIENCE 
AND PROVED THAT YOU NEED EDUCATING AT A VERY EARLY AGE 
SOME OF THE INFORMATION GIVEN WAS MAYBE TOO IN DEPTH 
I LIKED WHAT THEY WAS TRYING TO PASS OVER TO THE YOUNGER POPULATION 
BUT I THINK THEY WAFFLED ON QUITE A LOT 
IF THE SHOW WAS READILY AVAILABLE AND GOES THROUGH SCHOOLS 
THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THERE WAS A GROUP DISCUSSION WITH THE GIRLS 
COULD YOU JUST LIST THE DIETS THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF 
THE ATKINS DIET 
SPECIAL K. CARB DIET 
THE FACT THAT IT WAS ABOUT HEALTHY EATING AND REGULAR EXERCISE 
YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULTS 
WE WERE JOINING IN WITH THOSE EXERCISES WHILE THE CLIP WAS ON 
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE US SNAP BACK INTO POSITION 
DO WRITE TO US AT 
PHONE ME ON 
OR E. MAIL AT 
AND HERE'S THE WEBSITE AS WELL 
BY MY RECKONING THAT WAS A NEW COMMISSION 
A MUCH NEEDED EXPLANATION TWO ANSWERS AND A MEERKAT FRAUD 
SO WE'RE ON A ROLL RIGHT 
YOU AND ME AGAINST THE WORLD SEE YOU NEXT WEEK 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET 
YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
