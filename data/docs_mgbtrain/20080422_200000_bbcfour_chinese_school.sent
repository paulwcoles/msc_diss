CHINA A ONE PARTY COMMUNIST STATE UNDERGOING RAPID CHANGE 
HOME TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SCHOOLCHILDREN AND THE SMALL TOWN OF XIUNING 
HI 
THIS IS THE STORY OF THREE SCHOOLS HERE 
AND LIFE OVER THE YEAR OF THE GOLDEN PIG 
IT'S AUGUST AND THE ACADEMIC YEAR BEGINS WITH A LESSON FROM THE ARMY 
STAR STUDENT WU YUFEI HAS MADE IT INTO CHINA'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY 
BUT WILL SHE SURVIVE HER TOUGHEST CHALLENGE YET 
AT PING MIN PRIMARY LEAVING HOME 
IS A BIG STEP FOR NEW GIRL CHENG LIU HUI M. E. I. 
AND IN THE TOP CLASS AT THE COUNTY'S BEST SCHOOL 
THE PRESSURE IS ON FOR LI YIYING AND HER CLASSMATES FROM DAY ONE 
HIGH SCHOOL LIFE IS HARD AT THE BEGINNING BUT EVERY BEGINNING'S HARD 
ANHUI IS ONE OF THE MOST RURAL PROVINCES IN CHINA 
IT'S LARGELY UNDEVELOPED AND THE MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME IS AGRICULTURE 
THERE'S A GROWING DISPARITY BETWEEN THOSE BENEFITING FROM CHINA'S ECONOMIC MIRACLE 
AND THOSE LIVING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AWAY FROM THE BIG CITIES 
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
HAS MADE A COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF RURAL SCHOOLS 
AND ELIMINATE PRIMARY TUITION FEES 
BUT THE STANDARD OF BASIC EDUCATION 
STILL VARIES GREATLY BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS 
SEVEN YEAR OLD CHENG LIU HUI M. E. I. 
LIVES ALONE WITH HER DAD IN ONE TINY ROOM BEHIND HIS SMALL SHOP IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
SHE'S THE ONLY CHILD IN THE VILLAGE SELECTED TO RECEIVE AN EDUCATION 
AT A CHARITY RUN PRIMARY SCHOOL IN THE NEARBY TOWN 
TODAY IS THE FIRST PROPER DAY AT HER NEW SCHOOL 
AND THEY'RE MAKING THE HOUR LONG BUS JOURNEY TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF XIUNING 
PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL WAS OPENED THREE YEARS AGO 
IT'S NOT A STATE SCHOOL BUT IS FUNDED BY A CHARITABLE FOUNDATION 
ESTABLISHED BY A WEALTHY CHINESE ENTREPRENEUR 
WHO MADE HIS MONEY MANUFACTURING FLAT PACK WOODEN HOUSES 
THERE ARE JUST THIRTY CHILDREN STARTING AT PING MIN TODAY 
ALL HAVE BEEN INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED 
ON THE BASIS THAT THEY ARE FROM SOME OF THE POOREST FAMILIES IN THE AREA 
BY HEAD TEACHER MRS. ZHANG 
A PLACE AT PING MIN OFFERS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY 
THE CHILDREN WILL RECEIVE A HIGH STANDARD OF EDUCATION AND FREE BOARDING ON SITE 
BUT LIVING AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS THEY WILL HAVE TO LEARN TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES 
BECAUSE THE CHILDREN COME FROM REMOTE VILLAGES 
IN THE SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS 
THEY WON'T SEE THEIR FAMILIES UNTIL THEY GO HOME FOR A HOLIDAY IN A MONTH'S TIME 
ON HEARING THEIR CHILD'S NAME THE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS MUST LEAVE 
AFTER LUNCH THE NEW CHILDREN ARE BACK IN THEIR CLASSROOM 
WITH HEAD TEACHER MRS. ZHANG 
THE END OF AUGUST ALSO MEANS A NEW TERM AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
THE SCHOOL IS STATE RUN BUT THE SEVEN HUNDRED NEW STUDENTS ENROLLING TODAY 
HAVE ALL HAD TO PASS AN ENTRANCE EXAM 
XIUNING HIGH IS A KEY SCHOOL 
WHICH MEANS IT TAKES THE BRIGHTEST YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY 
AND RECEIVES EXTRA RESOURCES FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
BUT LIKE ALL STATE SENIOR SCHOOLS IN CHINA 
PARENTS MUST PAY TUITION FEES BOARDING COSTS AND FOR STUDY MATERIALS 
AT XIUNING THAT COSTS A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTY A YEAR 
A SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE FOR ALL THESE FAMILIES 
JUST A SELECT FEW WILL RECEIVE SCHOLARSHIPS TO HELP WITH THE COST 
THE SIXTY FIVE STUDENTS WHO RANKED HIGHEST IN THE ENTRANCE EXAM 
ARE IN CLASS ONE AND WILL SPEND THEIR NEXT THREE YEARS 
UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF CLASS TUTOR MR. HE 
BUT THE SCHOOL YEAR DOESN'T START IN THE CLASSROOM 
FIRST LIKE STUDENTS ACROSS CHINA 
THE NEW PUPILS AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
MUST TAKE PART IN FOUR DAYS COMPULSORY MILITARY TRAINING 
THE MAIN MESSAGE OF THE MILITARY TRAINING 
IS TO GET ALL THE STUDENTS TO BE BETTER DISCIPLINED 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY THEY ARE STRONGER 
AND THEY LEARN TO WORK TOGETHER AND TO HELP EACH OTHER TO 
THEY LEARN TO OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES AND HARDSHIPS 
THE TRAINING WILL CULMINATE IN A WELL DRILLED PARADE 
IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
BUT MR. HE'S NEW CLASS HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO 
AS WELL AS TRAINING FOR THE PARADE 
THE SOLDIERS VISIT THE STUDENTS' NEW DORMS 
TO INSTRUCT THEM HOW TO KEEP A WELL DISCIPLINED HOME FROM HOME 
AT PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL 
THE NEW PUPILS SPEND THEIR FIRST WEEK ADAPTING TO LIFE AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS 
AND LEARNING HOW TO DO THINGS FOR THEMSELVES 
THE SCHOOL PROVIDES THREE MEALS A DAY 
WITH MUCH MORE VARIETY THAN MANY OF THE CHILDREN ARE USED TO 
THEY MUST LEARN TO MARCH IN LINE 
BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SCHOOL 
AND REMEMBER THEIR NUMBER SO THEY CAN WALK IN THE SAME FORMATION EVERY TIME 
INSTEAD THINGS ARE MORE RELAXED AS THEY COMPLETE THEIR REGISTRATION 
THE FIRST HURDLE THEY HAVE TO CROSS IS A HEALTH CHECK AT THE HOSPITAL 
SEVEN YEAR OLD CHEN FUJIEN IS AFRAID OF NEEDLES 
EACH CHILD MUST HAVE A BLOOD TEST 
IF THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THEY ARE CARRYING AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE 
THEIR FUTURE AT PING MIN MAY BE IN QUESTION 
AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL MILITARY TRAINING IS COMING TO AN END 
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE PARADE 
CLASS ONE HAVE A CHANCE TO RELAX WITH THEIR NEW TEACHER 
ACTING CLASS MONITOR LI YIYING LOVES CLASSICAL CHINESE SONGS 
NEXT IS YU'KER 
WHO HAS SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TO SHOW TO HER NEW CLASSMATES 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD LI YIYING AND YU'KER ARE IN THE SAME DORMITORY 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME EITHER OF THEM 
HAS LIVED AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS 
IT'S THE DAY OF THE MILITARY PARADE 
ALL SEVEN HUNDRED NEW STUDENTS MUST MARCH PAST THE HEAD TEACHER 
AND THE SCHOOL'S COMMUNIST PARTY REPRESENTATIVE 
THE PARADE MARKS THE END OF MILITARY TRAINING 
AND THE START OF A RIGOROUS DAILY ACADEMIC ROUTINE 
THAT WILL SHAPE THE LIVES OF THESE STUDENTS FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS 
PREPARING FOR THE NATIONAL COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM THE G. A. O. KAO 
IT'S A WEEK INTO TERM AT PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL 
THE FIRST YEAR STUDENTS ARE SETTLING IN TO LIFE WITH THEIR CLASSMATES 
TODAY HEAD TEACHER MRS. ZHANG IS BACK AT THE HOSPITAL 
TO PICK UP THE HEALTH TEST RESULTS 
IT SEEMS FIVE OF THE CHILDREN ARE MALNOURISHED 
BUT ONE MIGHT HAVE A FAR MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM 
AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL IT'S SUNDAY NIGHT 
AND THE STUDENTS ARE IN THEIR CLASSROOMS 
CHINA IS A ONE PARTY STATE WITHOUT NATIONAL ELECTIONS 
BUT IN SCHOOLS PUPILS GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR THE STUDENT 
WHO WILL BE THEIR CLASS MONITOR 
LI YIYING HAS BEEN ACTING AS CLASS MONITOR SINCE TERM BEGAN 
TONIGHT SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PERSUADE HER CLASSMATES TO VOTE FOR HER 
IF SHE'S TO CONTINUE IN THE ROLE FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS 
SHE'S BEEN BUSY PREPARING HER SPEECH 
BUT TWO OTHER STUDENTS HAVE ALSO DECIDED TO RUN FOR THE POST 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD LIU XIANG AND ONE OF THE TOP RANKING STUDENTS FAN XIAOXUAN 
LI YIYING IS FIRST TO TAKE THE STAND 
NEXT IS LIU XIANG 
FINALLY FAN XIAOXUAN 
WHO'S NEVER HELD A CLASS MONITOR POSITION BEFORE 
AT PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL 
CHEN FUJIEN HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF LESSONS BY HIS GRANDFATHER 
HE'S GOING BACK TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A FURTHER BLOOD TEST 
WHICH WILL DECIDE WHETHER HE IS ABLE TO CONTINUE HIS EDUCATION AT THE SCHOOL 
CHEN FUJIEN'S GRANDFATHER MUST PAY FOR THE BLOOD TEST 
THEY'VE GOT TO WAIT THIRTY MINUTES TO GET THE RESULTS 
LAST YEAR THE TOP PERFORMING STUDENT AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL WAS WU YUFEI 
SHE BEAT OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS 
TO GET THE PROVINCE'S HIGHEST EXAM RESULTS 
AND BECAME SOMETHING OF A LOCAL CELEBRITY 
SHE'S THE BEST STUDENT IN MY EYES IN MY HEART THE BEST 
TONIGHT SHE'S ON HER WAY TO BEIJING 
TO START LIFE AT ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES IN CHINA TSINGHUA 
HER ENTIRE FAMILY INCLUDING HER GRANDPARENTS 
IS JOURNEYING TO THE CAPITAL TO SETTLE HER IN 
AFTER FOUR DAYS' SIGHTSEEING WU YUFEI IS ENROLLING AT TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY 
FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS SHE WILL BE STUDYING FINANCE AND ECONOMICS 
ALONGSIDE CHINA'S VERY BEST STUDENTS 
ADMISSION TO CHINESE UNIVERSITY IS FIERCELY COMPETITIVE 
ONLY SIXTY PER CENT OF STUDENTS WHO TAKE THE NATIONAL COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM 
SUCCEED IN GOING ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION 
AND ONLY A MINUTE FRACTION OF THEM GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY AT TSINGHUA 
BUT HAVING COME SO FAR 
WU YUFEI WON'T BE ABLE TO START HER STUDIES JUST YET 
JUST LIKE AT SCHOOL SHE MUST TAKE PART IN COMPULSORY MILITARY TRAINING 
EXCEPT AT TSINGHUA IT LASTS FOR TWENTY DAYS 
TODAY WU YUFEI AND HER FELLOW STUDENTS 
ARE LEARNING A NEW MANOEUVRE 
STUDENTS GASP 
AFTER CRAWLING ALONG THE GROUND WU YUFEI MUST GET BACK ON HER FEET 
WITHOUT USING HER HANDS 
AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL THE ACADEMIC YEAR HAS BEGUN 
THE NEW STUDENTS MUST ADAPT TO A ROUTINE 
THAT MAXIMISES EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY 
FOR THE FIRST YEARS THE MORNING BEGINS AT FIVE FIFTY A M. WITH GROUP EXERCISES 
AND FOUR LAPS OF THE RUNNING TRACK 
NEXT IS FORTY MINUTES MEMORIZING TEXTBOOKS IN THEIR CLASSROOM 
AFTER BREAKFAST THE STUDENTS START THEIR FIRST CLASS AT SEVEN FIFTY A M. 
IT'S LESSONS UNTIL ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
LUNCH IS FOLLOWED BY A TWO HOUR NAP TO RECHARGE THEIR BATTERIES 
THEN IT'S BACK TO THE CLASSROOM UNTIL SUPPER TIME 
AND THEN FURTHER STUDYING UNTIL NINE HUNDRED FORTY AT NIGHT 
FINALLY THE STUDENTS HEAD BACK TO THEIR DORMS TO DO THEIR LAUNDRY BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP 
AND THEN IT STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN AT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THE NEXT DAY 
IT'S NEARLY TWO WEEKS SINCE THE START OF TERM 
MR. HE USES HIS SPOKEN ENGLISH CLASS 
TO FIND OUT HOW HIS STUDENTS ARE ADAPTING TO THEIR NEW SCHEDULE 
ANY OTHER TROUBLE 
NEXT TO RAISE A PROBLEM IS LI YIYING 
EVERY DAY WHEN WE BUY THE BREAKFAST THE LUNCH OR THE DINNER 
OH THERE IS MANY PE UM MANY STUDENTS WAITING LINE 
THE LINE IS SO LONG IT'S SO CRAZY I CAN'T STAND IT 
I DO HAVE SOME ADVICE FOR YOU 
IF YOU THINK THE QUEUE IS TOO LONG 
YOU STAY IN THE CLASSROOM DOING SOME HOMEWORK 
I MEAN SOMETIME LATER THE QUEUE WILL BE SHORTER 
SO DON'T GO THERE STANDING THERE WASTING A LOT OF TIME 
SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN HERE YOU MIGHT HAVE COME ACROSS SOME DIFFICULTIES 
OR PROBLEMS 
YOU STUDY LONGER THAN YOU DID IN MIDDLE SCHOOL 
AND YOU HAVE MORE PRESSURE 
MANY OF YOU MAY FIND IT TOO HARD TO LEAVE YOUR BED EARLY IN THE MORNING 
IT'S THE BIG CHANGE 
I GET UP EARLY TOO 
I COME HERE EARLIER THAN MANY OF YOU ARE SO NO COMPLAINTS 
NO COMPLAINTS 
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES 
YES 
IF YOU ARE STRONG WILLED 
IF YOU WANNA CHALLENGE YOURSELF IF WA 
IF YOU WANT TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES AND YOU TRY YOUR BEST 
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT 
SO HIGH SCHOOL LIFE IS HARD AT THE BEGINNING 
BUT EVERY BEGINNING'S HARD 
THERE IS SOME TIME AWAY FROM LESSONS 
STUDENTS SPEND SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO SUNDAY EVENING AT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES 
TODAY ONE OF MR. HE'S PUPILS LIU XIANG IS VISITING HIS GRANNY IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
THE LIVES OF LIU XIANG'S GENERATION COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT FROM THEIR GRANDPARENTS 
ANOTHER OF MR. HE'S NEW STUDENTS YU'KER IS SPENDING TIME WITH HER MUM AND GRANDMOTHER 
WHO LIVE IN THE NEARBY CITY OF TUNXI 
HER GRANDMOTHER HAS JUST RETURNED FROM A HOLIDAY TO HONG KONG 
YU'KER HAS HER OWN IDEAS ABOUT HOW SHE'D LIKE HER LIFE TO TURN OUT 
ON SATURDAY NIGHT YU'KER GETS A WELCOME BREAK FROM HER NEW SCHOOL ROUTINE 
IT'S SUNDAY MORNING THE ONE CHANCE MR. HE GETS TO RELAX AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY 
MR. HE HIS WIFE AND EIGHT YEAR OLD SON LIVE IN ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED BY THE SCHOOL 
TODAY THEY HAVE EXTENDED FAMILY JOINING THEM FOR LUNCH 
THE INTENSIVE ROUTINE AT XIUNING DOESN'T JUST AFFECT MR. HE'S STUDENTS 
MY WIFE IS VERY VERY KIND 
SHE KNOWS WHAT I'M DOING BUT SOMETIMES SHE FEELS BAD 
ABOUT MY BEING UNABLE TO COME HOME VERY OFTEN 
AND SOMETIMES SHE COMPLAINS ABOUT IT 
BUT WE ARE VERY UNDERSTANDING ON HER ACCOUNT 
MR. HE'S WIFE IS A COMPUTER TEACHER AT THE SAME SCHOOL 
LESSONS ARE IN FULL SWING AT PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL 
IN CLASS ONE CHEN LIU HUI M. E. I. SEEMS TO BE THRIVING 
FRIENDS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE 
BUT SOME OF THE CHILDREN HAVEN'T GOT USED TO THE ROUTINE OF COMING STRAIGHT BACK TO CLASS AFTER BREAK 
CLASS TEACHER MR. WANG WANTS TO FIND OUT WHO HAS BEEN MAKING THE BOYS LATE BACK 
ONCE A WEEK MRS. ZHANG HOLDS A SPECIAL CLASS WITH THE FIRST YEARS 
SHE'S A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE IMPORTANCE OF A CLEAR MORAL EDUCATION 
THE CHILDREN ARE ENCOURAGED TO STAND UP AND CONFESS THEIR WRONGDOINGS 
IN FRONT OF THEIR CLASSMATES 
IT'S LUNCHTIME AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
LI YIYING AND HER FRIEND HAVE EACH PERSUADED THEIR PARENTS 
TO RENT THEM A ROOM ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE SCHOOL 
NOW THEY CAN CONCENTRATE HARDER ON THEIR STUDIES AWAY FROM THE DISTRACTIONS OF THE DORMITORY 
HAVING FAILED TO BECOME CLASS MONITOR 
LI YIYING IS NOW DETERMINED TO SHINE ACADEMICALLY 
IN A FEW DAYS TIME CLASS ONE HAVE A MATHS TEST 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY'LL BE ASSESSED SINCE JOINING THE KEY SCHOOL 
SO EVERYONE IS BUSY STUDYING TO MAKE SURE THEY JUSTIFY THEIR PLACE IN THE TOP CLASS 
IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE MATHS TEST 
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE THREE YEARS UNTIL CLASS ONE WILL TAKE THEIR NATIONAL COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM 
THE G. A. O. KAO THE PRESSURE IS ON TO PERFORM 
ALTHOUGH G. A. O. KAO IS STILL IN THREE YEARS TIME 
IT'S STILL VERY FAR AWAY 
EVERY TIME WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR THE SAKE OF G. A. O. KAO 
SO THEY UNDERSTAND IT 
I MEAN RANKING MEANS A LOT MORE PRESSURE 
BUT WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND THE PRESSURE THEY CANNOT SUCCEED IT 
I MEAN IN THEIR LIFE 
I WANT THEM TO BE VERY INDEPENDENT 
I RESPECT THEIR PERSONALITIES BUT I DO WANT THEM TO TO KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING 
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING COLLEGE PEOPLE 
LIKE ALL THE STUDENTS IN HER CLASS LI YIYING IS AN ONLY CHILD 
HER MUM AND DAD TAKE IT IN TURNS TO STAY WITH HER EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK 
IN BEIJING WU YUFEI HAS COMPLETED HER MILITARY TRAINING AND IS SETTLING INTO COLLEGE LIFE 
DESPITE BEING ALONGSIDE THE BEST STUDENTS IN CHINA 
IT WOULD SEEM WU YUFEI IS STILL MANAGING TO COME TOP OF HER CLASS 
BUT WU YUFEI WILL HAVE TO KEEP FOCUSED ON HER STUDIES IF SHE'S TO HOLD HER OWN AT TSINGHUA 
AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL THE MATHS TEST RESULTS ARE IN 
LI YIYING HAS DONE WELL 
BUT NOT QUITE AS WELL AS SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED 
CLASS MONITOR FAN XIAOXUAN HAS EXCELLED 
BUT EIGHT STUDENTS HAVE FAILED THE TEST 
MR. HE CALLS THEM INTO HIS OFFICE AFTER CLASS 
I JUST WANTED THEM TO REALISE WHY THEY FAILED IN THEIR FIRST EXAM 
AND I I WANTED TO HELP THEM BE AWARE THAT FAILURE IS NOT 
A BETTER THING SOMETIMES 
IF YOU CAN LEARN FROM THE FAILURE AND YOU KEEP WORKING HARD YOU MAKE PROGRESS 
AND YOU WILL SUCCEED 
AT PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL THE FIRST TERM IS AT AN END 
MUMS DADS GRANNIES AND GRANDFATHERS HAVE TRAVELLED IN FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE 
TO PICK UP THEIR CHILDREN 
IT'S AN EMOTIONAL REUNION AFTER A MONTH APART 
AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL THE STUDENTS ALSO HAVE A WEEK'S HOLIDAY 
BEFORE THEY CAN LEAVE MR. HE HAS ONE FINAL SURPRISE 
BUT LI YIYING KNOWS HER STUDIES MUST COME FIRST IF SHE'S TO EARN A PLACE AT UNIVERSITY 
ON THE NEXT CHINESE SCHOOL OLYMPIC FEVER HITS XIUNING COUNTY 
AND THERE'S LOTS MORE ABOUT LIFE AND SCHOOL IN CHINA AT 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
