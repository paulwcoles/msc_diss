THE CABINETS ARE THAT WAY TIME TO START YOUR ROUNDS 
SO THE CASH IS ON DRIP THE BED PANS ARE OVERFLOWING BUT WHO WILL BAG THE BEST BARGAINS 
WORKING THE WEEKEND SHIFT WITH THE REDS IS KATE BLISS 
AND GIVING THE BLUES A CLOSE EXAMINATION IS DAVID HARPER 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS YOU TWO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE IT'S A TOAST RACK 
I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE AND IT'S REALLY RETRO 
I LIKE THAT I LIKE THE DESIGN ON THE END I HAVE TO SAY I THINK THE PATTERN'S THE WEAKEST BIT ABOUT IT 
IT'S CALLED CIRCUS PATTERN AS YOU SEE FROM THE ACROBATS ON IT 
YES BUT I THINK IT'S THE SHAPE THAT REALLY GIVES IT THE IMPACT 
IT'S GOT THAT RETRO LOOK TYPICAL FIFTIES WITH THESE CURVED ENDS HERE 
ECHOED IN THESE BARS IT REMINDS ME OF THOSE FIFTIES PLASTIC CHAIRS 
THEY ALMOST LOOK LIKE BUBBLES AND YOU COULD USE IT ON YOUR BREAKFAST TABLE I REALLY LIKE IT YEAH 
WE'VE GOT THE FACTORY MARK ON THE BOTTOM THERE 
IT'S CIRCUS THAT'S THE PATTERN BY BESWICK I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BESWICK 
BESWICK IS AN ENGLISH FACTORY IT WAS BEST KNOWN FOR PRODUCING LITTLE MODEL ANIMALS 
EVERYTHING FROM HORNED BULLS DOWN TO LITTLE DOMESTIC CATS AND DOGS 
BUT IT DID PRODUCE UTILITARIAN WARE LIKE THIS FUNCTIONAL ITEMS AND THIS IS WHERE THIS FALLS IN 
SO WOULD IT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD BUY CLARE YES DEFINITELY HOW MUCH IS IT IT'S FIFTEEN 
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S QUITE A RETAIL PRICE 
AT AUCTION IT MIGHT JUST MAKE A TENNER SO WE OUGHT TO TRY AND GET IT AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE YES 
SO YOU CAN DO THE NEGOTIATING O. K. 
THEY SLICED SEVEN POUNDS OFF THE PRICE 
AND BOUGHT IT FOR EIGHT QUID 
JANICE WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS IT'S PRETTY I DON'T THINK IT'S CRANBERRY GLASS 
SHALL WE ASK DAVID WHAT HE THINKS YES IT'S NOT CRANBERRY 
IT'S TOO PINK TO BE CRANBERRY RIGHT IT'S FIFTY FIVE QUID IT DOESN'T LOOK EXPENSIVE 
YOU CAN SEE IT'S HAND BLOWN 
CAN YOU SEE THE IMPERFECTIONS MM HMM IT'S NOT FACTORY MADE 
IT'S MADE BY HAND AND AIR 
IT'S GOT IMPERFECTIONS WHICH FOR ME MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED YOU'RE ALMOST THERE I THINK THAT'S EARLY TO MID NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AND IT'S CALLED A TAZZA A TAZZA O. K. WHAT WOULD YOU USE IT FOR 
I'D PUT POTPOURRI IN I'D WANT TO USE IT SWEETS YES BONBON DISH 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S FOR RATHER THAN NOT BEING USED 
IT'S A REALLY DELICATE SUPER DUPER ITEM 
IS THE COLOUR OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE NO THE COLOUR IS JUST OF ITS TIME 
IT PRE DATES THE CRANBERRY THE MUCH RICHER RED 
SO IT'S JUST A COLOUR FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY FANTASTIC 
IT'S MORE ATTRACTIVE NOW I KNOW MORE ABOUT IT I AGREE ESPECIALLY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
IF WE COULD GET IT FOR THIRTY WE'D MAKE A PROFIT SO WE LIKE IT YES WE WANT TO BUY IT YES DEFINITELY 
IT'S FIFTY FIVE BUT WE CAN BUY IT CHEAPER BEV YOU'LL DO IT I'LL GO AND BARGAIN 
DON'T BE NICE BE HARD I WILL 
PRETTY IN PINK THEY SNAPPED IT UP FOR THIRTY 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE OF THESE THINGS BEFORE 
ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY PRACTICAL IN TODAY'S KITCHEN FOR KEEPING YOUR CLOVES NUTMEG AND CINNAMON 
THIS IS CALLED A SPICE TOWER YOU UNSCREW THESE DIFFERENT SECTIONS IT'S STILL GOT SOME CINNAMON IN IT 
THE THING IS MADE OF TURNED WOOD SO IT'S CALLED A TREEN OBJECT SOMETHING MADE OF TURNED WOOD 
YOU CAN TELL WHAT THE COMPARTMENTS ARE AS EACH SECTION HAS A LABEL 
APPLIED TO THE TURNED WOOD SECTION AND VARNISHED OVER THE TOP THIS WAS PROBABLY MADE ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY 
AND YOU'D THINK IT'S QUITE A RARE OBJECT WELL IT IS BUT JUST CLOCK THIS 
ONE MINUTE YOU HAVE A RARE SPICE TOWER AND THEN YOU GO TWO OR THREE CABINETS DOWN I OPEN UP THIS DOOR 
JUST LOOK WHAT I FOUND ANOTHER SPICE TOWER THIS TIME FOR CLOVES GINGER AND MACE 
AMAZING IN ONE ANTIQUE CENTRE TWO RARE OBJECTS IN SEPARATE CABINETS 
WELL THIS IS YOUR MOMENT TO SHOP AROUND HOW MUCH IS THIS ONE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE NOT CHEAP 
HOW MUCH IS THIS ONE TWO HUNDRED FIVE SO YOU COULD SAVE YOURSELF FORTY BY GETTING THIS ONE RATHER THAN THAT ONE 
BUT TAKE A GOOD LOOK THIS ONE'S GOT A NASTY CHIP ON THE TOP 
AND I MUCH PREFER THE PASTED LABELS ON THIS ONE TO THE LABELS ON THAT SO AT TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
AT LEAST YOU CAN REASSURE YOURSELF THAT BY SHOPPING AROUND YOU'VE GOT THE BEST PRICE FOR THE BEST OBJECT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK TO THIS I REALLY LIKE IT I LIKE THE WAY THE LIGHT CATCHES THE TOP OF THE BOTTLE 
AND I LIKE THIS DESIGN ROUND HERE 
I LIKE THAT IT'S QUITE ROUNDED IT'S REALLY DECORATIVE WHAT DO YOU THINK NICOLA IT'S REALLY PRETTY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK WHAT STRIKES ME IS THAT THE BLACK HAS A FEELING OF THE VICTORIAN PERIOD ABOUT IT 
AND THE VICTORIANS USED BLACK A LOT COS IT WAS AN ERA OF MOURNING ONCE PRINCE ALBERT HAD DIED 
BUT HAVING SAID THAT IT DOES GIVE IT QUITE A STRIKING IMAGE DOESN'T IT YES 
BUT DOES THE STOPPER MATCH THAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU'VE GOT TO ASK WHETHER THAT IS THE ORIGINAL ONE 
THAT FITS SNUGLY IN THERE 
AND THE FACETS ARE ECHOED IN THE COLLAR ROUND HERE 
AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S NICE ABOUT THIS ONE 
IS THAT THE ACTUAL CUT GLASS IS QUITE DEEP ON THERE IN THAT FRIEZE 
IT'S ALMOST GOT A NEO CLASSICAL FEEL ABOUT IT 
ALMOST LIKE A LAUREL WREATH BUT THE QUALITY OF THE CUTTING IS NICE 
IT SAYS ON THE LABEL NINETEEN TWENTY SO IT'S EDWARDIAN PERIOD 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PRICE I MEAN THAT'S FORTY EIGHT 
AND THAT'S A FAIR RETAIL PRICE BUT AT AUCTION I WOULD ESTIMATE IT PROBABLY TWENTY TO THIRTY RIGHT 
BUT IF TWO PEOPLE REALLY LIKED IT 
THEY MIGHT BID AGAINST EACH OTHER SO WE SHOULD NEGOTIATE WHAT DO YOU THINK YES 
SHALL I GIVE YOU A HAND YES PLEASE O. K. COME ON 
KATE WORKED HER MAGIC AND GOT THE PRICE DOWN TO THIRTY TWO 
BEV DAVID WHAT DO YOU THINK TO THIS I LIKE THAT 
IT'S REALLY PRETTY WHAT DO YOU THINK DAVID 
I THINK IT'S VERY POOLE DID YOU KNOW IT WAS POOLE I DIDN'T NO 
I DO COS MY SISTER COLLECTS IT IT'S LOVELY WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT 
I THINK IT'S REALLY STRIKING IT'S THE COLOURS THAT I FIND REALLY ATTRACTIVE 
IT PUTS A SMILE ON YOUR FACE YES IT'S VERY GOOD QUALITY IS IT YOUR CUP OF TEA BEV 
IT DEFINITELY IS I LOVE THE COLOUR 
I'D DEFINITELY HAVE IT IN MY HOUSE YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE SOMETHING TO BUY IT WELL 
SO IS IT PARTICULARLY OLD NO DEFINITELY NOT SIXTIES SEVENTIES EIGHTIES EVEN YESTERDAY I'M NOT TOO SURE 
BUT THE BUYERS ARE THERE BUT REMEMBER PRICE SENSITIVE 
IF YOU PAY TOO MUCH MONEY YOU'RE STUFFED RIGHT IT'S GORGEOUS 
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BUY IT CHEAP FOR IT TO MAKE SOME PROFIT IN AUCTION SO PRICE WISE GIRLS SIXTY FIVE

JANICE IT'S YOUR TURN FORTY QUID O. K. I'M GOING FOR IT STICK AT IT

IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOUR TEMPERATURE SOAR 
NOW GIRLS WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS 
THIS IS SOMETHING A BIT MORE ANTIQUE FOR YOU WHAT IS IT IT'S A TWINE BOX 
SOMEONE'S PUT IN A BALL OF STRING TO SEE WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE 
IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED MAUCHLINE WARE AS IT ORIGINATED THERE IN SCOTLAND WHERE THEY MADE SOUVENIR ITEMS 
PROBABLY LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN DATE SO VICTORIAN AND MADE USUALLY OF WOOD 
AND PRINTED WITH SOUVENIR VIEWS THIS ONE IS OF THE LAKE DISTRICT 
WE'VE GOT VARIOUS TITLE VIEWS HERE 
THIS IS KESWICK BOAT STATION ON DERWENTWATER 
AND WE'VE GOT THE RIGGS WINDERMERE HOTEL ON THE TOP THERE 
IS IT COLLECTABLE 
IT IS THERE'S A BIG FOLLOWING FOR MAUCHLINE WARE THIS IS NICE BECAUSE IT'S A TURNED PIECE 
THE SIDES WHERE IT'S QUITE THIN HAVEN'T CRACKED AT ALL SO THE CONDITION IS GOOD 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I LIKE IT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'VE GOT IF IT IS COLLECTABLE THEN 
YEAH WE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE SAYS 
YEAH WE MIGHT MAKE SOME MONEY AT AUCTION FROM IT HOW MUCH IS IT LET'S LOOK ON HERE WE'VE GOT FORTY FIVE 
I CAN SEE THIS MAKING THIRTY TO MAYBE FIFTY AT AUCTION BECAUSE IT'S IN LOVELY CONDITION

WHICH MAKES IT ARTS AND CRAFTS 
I'D LOVE TO THINK IT WAS SCOTTISH BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE THISTLE BUT WITH THE BIRMINGHAM MARK IT ISN'T 
BUT STILL IT IS TOTALLY UNIQUE AND THAT'S THE BEST THING ABOUT IT IS THIS GLASS OR ENAMEL 
NO IT'S GLASS REAL THICK BLOWN GLASS OH RIGHT 
IT'S GOOD QUALITY WOULD IT HAVE HAD A SILVER STOPPER YES A CORK WITH A SILVER TOP 
BUT WHO'S TO SAY IT DIDN'T JUST HAVE A CORK YOU CAN BUY THEM ANYWAY

I FEEL A COUNTRY HOUSE COMING ON 
HARDWICK HALL IN DERBYSHIRE WAS BUILT BY THE RICH AND POWERFUL BESS OF SHREWSBURY IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE IN THE COUNTRY TO SEE THE ELABORATE NATURE OF TUDOR INTERIOR DECORATION 
THE MOST IMPORTANT ROOM IN THE HOUSE AND SO THE MOST SUMPTUOUSLY AND EXPENSIVELY DECORATED IS THIS 
THE HIGH GREAT CHAMBER WE'VE GOT A FRIEZE IN THIS CASE A VERY DEEP FRIEZE 
THAT RUNS THE ENTIRE WAY AROUND THE ROOM AND WHAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT IT IS THAT IT'S IN VERY HIGH RELIEF 
IT'S SIX OR EIGHT FEET DEEP 
THIS IS CALLED ALTO RELIEVO AND IS ACHIEVED BY THE PLASTERERS MIXING UP A THICK SLURRY 
PROBABLY USING A BIT OF URINE TO GIVE IT DECENT CONSISTENCY 
THEN SHOVING IN HORSE HAIR TO THICKEN IT UP AND FOR THE BITS THAT STICK OUT A LONG WAY 
PROBABLY USING METAL ARMATURES TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WON'T FALL DOWN 
IT DOES TELL A STORY WHICH COMPLIMENTS QUEEN ELIZABETH I 
DIANA AT THE END IN HER LEAFY BOWER 
COULD ALSO BE THE SOVEREIGN QUEEN 
AND THUS THE CHOICE OF FLOWERS THE LILIES THE PINKS ALL OF WHICH ARE EMBLEMATIC OF VIRGINITY 
ALSO REFLECT ON THE VIRGIN QUEEN AND WHAT DOES SHE DO 
SHE SURVEYS A FANTASTIC EXOTIC AND SUCCESSFUL HUNTING ACTIVITY 
AND THAT IN TURN COULD BE THOUGHT TO MEAN THAT THE STATE THAT SHE GOVERNS IS BEING GOVERNED WELL 
AND THAT'S A COMPLIMENT 
WHERE WAS BESS IN ALL OF THIS SHE WAS A PROUD WOMAN AND WOULDN'T WANT TO COMPLETE ALL THESE INTERIORS 
WITHOUT LEAVING HER OWN MARK JUST LOOK AT THE ROYAL COAT OF ARMS 
IT NORMALLY HAS THE MOTTO DIEU ET MON DROIT AND WHAT'S IT GOT 
IT'S DIEU E. S. T. MON DROIT SHE'S CLEVERLY INCORPORATED THE E. S. BIT INTO IT FOR ELIZABETH SHREWSBURY 
MUCKING ABOUT WITH THE ROYAL COAT OF ARMS SHE'S LUCKY NOT TO HAVE LOST HER HEAD FOR THAT ONE 
WE'RE OFF TO THE ELR AUCTION ROOMS IN SHEFFIELD

THAT IN AN AUCTION HOUSE COULD GO FOR BETWEEN FORTY AND SIXTY
