MM 
I USED TO LOVE BANANAS AND CREAM 
I USED TO MASH 'EM ALL UP LOTS OF CREAM AND SUGAR 
I'D SQUEEZE A MOUTHFUL THROUGH THE GAPS IN MY TEETH 
DO YOU LIKE SQUEEZING BANANAS THROUGH YOUR TEETH 
NO 
AND CHOCOLATE CREAM 
LOVELY 
AND TALKING OF THAT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING 
REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WAS IN THE BOER WAR 
CHRISTMAS NINETEEN HUNDRED IT WAS 
QUEEN VICTORIA SENT ALL OF US LADS A TIN BOX WITH A SLAB OF CHOCOLATE IN IT 
WHEN I WENT INTO HOSPITAL I GAVE IT TO CHARLIE HIGGINS TO LOOK AFTER 
YOU NEVER ATE IT I NEVER TOUCHED IT FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
THEN ONE DAY I SAID TO MYSELF I FANCY A BIT OF CHOCOLATE 
I OPENED THE TIN IT WAS FULL OF SAND 
CHARLIE HIGGINS HAD EATEN IT WHILE I WAS IN HOSPITAL 
BUT I GOT MY REVENGE ON HIM WHAT DID YOU DO 
EVERY YEAR WHEN WE HAD THE OLD COMRADES ASSOCIATION REUNION 
I USED TO LOOK CHARLIE HIGGINS FULL IN THE FACE AND SING 
COMRADES COMRADES EVER SINCE WE WERE BOYS 
SHARING EACH OTHER'S SORROW SHARING EACH OTHER'S 
CHOCOLATE 
HE USED TO GO ALL RED AND LOOK ON THE GROUND 
WASN'T A GREAT RHYME BUT IT DID THE TRICK 
SHE SAID NO SO DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID 
I PUT ME HEAD THROUGH THOSE GATE BARS AND PRETENDED I COULDN'T GET IT OUT 
WHAT DID YOUR MUM DO SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO CALL THE FIRE BRIGADE 
I TOOK ME HEAD OUT AND LAUGHED 
THEN SHE HIT ME 
KIDS ARE ALWAYS GETTING STUCK IN RAILINGS 
ALL I DID WAS ASK FOR CHOCOLATE SHE SAID NO 
SO I WENT OVER TO THE GATE AND STUCK ME HEAD THROUGH THAT'S ALL 
IT'S TIME TO GET BACK COME ON
