DEAR TELEVISION HAS MICHAEL BUERK BEEN GOT AT 
UNTIL RECENTLY HE ALWASY CONCLUDED B. B. C.'S TEN O' CLOCK NEWS WITH 
NEWSNIGHT IS STARTING NOW OVER ON B. B. C. TWO 
NEWSNIGHT STARTING OVER ON B. B. C. TWO NOW 
NEWSNIGHT'S STARTING NOW OVER ON B. B. C. TWO 
BUT FROM THE TEN O'CLOCK NEWS GOOD NIGHT 
HAS IT BEEN NOBBLED IF SO WE'D LIKE IT BACK PLEASE 
THE NEWS IS GLOOMY ENOUGH WITHOUT IT LOSING ALL PERSONALITY 
IF THAT'S WHAT MONEY DOES FOR YA I'LL BURN THE BUGGER WHAT MONEY 
I'VE ONLY HAD IT HALF A DAY SHOWING ME UP 
WHAT DOING YOU KNOW I DON'T WELL I DO 
WATCHING SPEND SPEND SPEND DISGUSTED ME SO MUCH I BEGAN TO FEEL SICK 
IT BEAT THE LOT FOR SWEARING AND LOW DOWN SEX 
I STILL DON'T SEE WHAT MIRRORS ARE FOR 
ALL THE BETTER TO SEE YOU WITH 
WHAT DOING WITH OUR MONEY WE CAN AFFORD A GOOD VIEW 
WHY SHOULD LANCASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE 
YOU STINKING BASTARD 
LET ME TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE MORE RESPECTABLE PEOPLE 
WITH OUR NATIONAL ASSISTANCE I'M NOT ALLOWED MONEY IN THE BANK 
WELL SEW IT IN THE MATTRESS YOU GORMLESS SOD 
FORTUNES OF WAR WAS A SPLENDID ACHIEVEMENT 
BUT I DON'T THINK SIMON IN EPISODE FIVE WOULD HAVE WORN BLACK SHOES 
WITH HIS KHAKI DRILL EVEN TO CLIMB A PYRAMID 
AND THE EDITION OF DOSTOEVSKY WHICH GUY HAD IN EPISODE SIX 
WAS FIRST PUBLISHED AFTER THE WAR IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX 
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WON'T BE THE CASE 
IN Z. CARS THERE WAS A POLICE PATROL CAR 
PARKED ON THE ZIGZAG MARKINGS OF A ROAD 
WHAT ARE WE STOPPING HERE FOR SERGEANT THERE'S NOWT ROUND HERE 
THEY WERE ALSO PARKED TOO NEAR A JUNCTION 
IF WE CAN'T PARK ON THEM WHY SHOULD THEY 
ROCK'N'ROLL GUITAR 
WELL I DON'T CARE IF THE SUN DON'T SHINE 
DEAR TELEVISION WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INTERVIEWED ON THE T. V. OR RADIO 
TO DISCOVER VIEWS ON CURRENT AFFAIRS OR THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND THEM 
THE INTERVIEWERS ALWAYS FIND TEENAGERS 
WHO HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN ROCK'N'ROLL AND FILM STARS' 
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR AMUSEMENT 
UM DATE GIRLS 
ANYTHING ELSE 
NOT REALLY NO 
AS A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD I'M SURE ANY ADULT WHO HAS NO CONTACT 
WITH THE YOUTH OF TODAY MUST GET A FALSE IDEA OF THE FUTURE CITIZENS OF THE WORLD 
I SEE YOU READ ONE OR TWO THINGS 
OH AYE YES I READ A FEW BOOKS I LIKE READING WOODWORK BOOKS 
THOSE ADULTS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THIS SHOULD BE REASSURED 
BY INTERVIEWS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DO SPEND TIME THINKING ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION POLITICS 
RELIGION AND THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD AND THIS COUNTRY IN PARTICULAR 
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN READING OR POLITICS 
NAH YOU COULDN'T SEE ME LOOKING AT A BOOK I READ THE BEANO 
LET US NOW ATTEMPT A RECIPE 
I WILL GIVE YOU ONE FOR AN UNRIVALLED PLUM PUDDING 
MARGARET TYZACK WAS DELIGHTFUL AS MRS. BEETON IN SOLO 
HYSTERICS MOSTLY HAPPEN IN YOUNG NERVOUS UNMARRIED WOMEN 
AND ARE ACCOMPANIED WITH CONVULSIONS SOBBING LAUGHTER 
THROWING ABOUT OF THE BODY ETC 
BUT I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PUDDING MIX AFTER THE PROGRAMME 
ALL THOSE EXPENSIVE INGREDIENTS LOTS OF DRIED FRUIT 
NOT TO MENTION SIXTEEN EGGS AND A QUARTER PINT OF BRANDY 
COULD THE B. B. C. REALLY DO NO MORE 
TO PUBLICISE SIDMOUTH'S INTERNATIONAL FOLK FESTIVAL 
THAN BY SHOWING MATTHEW COLLINS CLEANING OUT THE LOOS 
IT ATTRACTS EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
THERE ARE SEVEN HUNDRED EVENTS AND MANY IMPROMPTU DISPLAYS' 
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING LADIES WE'LL UNBLOCK YOUR LOO 
RIGHT CAN WE GO IN GEORGE 
AND WHERE WAS B. B. C. TWO CRIKEY HE WORKS LIKE LIGHTENING THIS MAN IN THE LOO 
BUT TERRY'S IN THERE NOW 
DEAR TELEVISION WE'VE HAD BATMAN AND SUPERMAN AND NOW IT APPEARS 
WE HAVE SUPERCOP IN THE FORM OF PAUL NICHOLLS 
P. C. TERRY SIDENHAM IN CITY CENTRAL 
HOW DID TERRY SURVIVE THE EXPLOSION WITHOUT GETTING HIS HAIR SINGED 
LOSING HIS EYEBROWS AND WITH ONLY MINOR REDDENING OF EXPOSED SKIN 
AND WHY WEREN'T HIS LUNGS DAMAGED HE MUST HAVE BREATHED IN THE SEARING GASES 
YET AFTER A CURSORY GLANCE FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO HOME 
SO WHAT D'YOU THINK OF IT SO FAR 
DO HOMOSEXUALS POSE A THREAT TO US INDIVIDUALLY 
IT HAS BEEN ARGUED 
DEAR TELEVISION 
IN THE PROGRAMME ON HOMOSEXUALS 
THE INTERVIEWER APPEARED TO ACCEPT WITHOUT QUESTION 
THE USE OF THE WORD GAY TO DESCRIBE THIS CONDITION 
DO YOU USE THE WORD GAY WHAT DOES IT MEAN GAY MEANS HOMOSEXUAL 
HE EVEN WENT ON TO EMPLOY IT IN THAT SENSE HIMSELF 
HAS THERE IN FACT EVER BEEN A SOCIETY WHICH HAS TOTALLY ACCEPTED 
AS DISTINCT FROM TOLERATED THE EXISTENCE OF GAY PEOPLE 
TO JUDGE FROM HOMOSEXUALS I HAVE KNOWN IN THE PAST AND FROM THOSE PRODUCED IN THIS PROGRAMME 
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT MOST OF US INSTINCTIVELY DISAPPROVE OF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO 
DO THEY OBJECT TO SUCH WORDS AS SODOMITE 
DO YOU WANT THE FREEDOM TO HAVE SEX IN PUBLIC LAVATORIES 
GAY PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE FACILITIES THERE ARE 
OR MUST THEY HAVE AMBIGUITY 
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAPPEN TO WALK INTO THESE PUBLIC LAVATORIES WHEN YOU ARE DOING YOUR THING THERE 
NEWSNIGHT STARTING NOW OVER ON B. B. C. TWO 
WE WERE DELIGHTED TO SEE THE LETTER ON THE SUBJECT OF MICHAEL BUERK'S SIGN OFF 
WE HAVE OFTEN WONDERED IF WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE TO SIT THROUGH MR. BUERK'S NEWS BULLETINS 
NEWSNIGHT STARTING OVER ON B. B. C. TWO NOW BUT 
AND THEN TO APPLAUD AND CHEER IF IT WAS AN ESPECIALLY GOOD ONE 
NEWSNIGHT STARTING NOW OVER ON B. B. C. TWO 
WE TOO FEARED HE'D BEEN GOT AT 
NEWSNIGHT IS STARTING NOW OVER ON B. B. C. TWO BUT FROM THE TEN O'CLOCK NEWS GOODNIGHT 
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MICHAEL
