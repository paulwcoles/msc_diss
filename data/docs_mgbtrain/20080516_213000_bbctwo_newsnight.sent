THE PRESIDENTIAL RUN OFF WAS SET

DIFFERENT PICTURE THE SYSTEMATIC 
TORTURE INFLICTED BY MUGABE'S 
HENCHMEN ON ANYONE WHO REFUSES TO 
SUPPORT HIM TONIGHT WE BRING YOU 
THE FIRST HAND ACCOUNT OF THE U. S. 
AMBASSADOR TO ZIMBABWE JAMES MCGEE 
WAS HELD BY THE AUTHORITIES FOR 
INVESTIGATING THE APPALLING 
VIOLENCE INFLICTED ON YOUNG MEN AND 
ELDERLY WOMEN ALIKE AFTER WE 
INTERVIEWED HE WAS ONCE MORE 
SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITIES AND 
TOLD HIS INTERFERENCE WILL NOT BE 
TOLERATED T. H. REPORT CONTAINS 
SHOCKING IMAGES OF INJURIES 
SUSTAINED UNDER TORTURE 
DEMOCRACY ZIMBABWE STYLE A DATE 
HAS BEEN FIXED AT LAST FOR THE 
DELAYED RUN OFF IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION IT'S TO BE JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH OP 
SIS SUPPORTERS ARE BEING PUNISHED 
FOR VOTING AGAINST MUGABE IN THE 
DISPUTED MARCH ELECTIONS NEW AND 
HORRIFIC PICTURES THAT REACHED US 
TODAY SHOW HOW M. D. C. SUPPORTERS HAVE 
HAD THEIR BACKSIDES BEATEN AND 
SLASHED AND IN AN EXCLUSIVE 
INTERVIEW THE U. S. AMBASSADOR TO ZM 
JAMES MCGEE TOLD ME OF HIS 
FINDINGS WHEN HE SET OUT TO 
INVESTIGATE THE VIOLENCE 
I WOULD 
SAY THIS VIOLENCE HAS SPUN OUT OF 
CONTROL THE CIVIL SOCIETY 
DIPLOMATIC GROUPS N. G. O. S. HAVE 
COMPILED WELL OVER A THOUSAND I 
THINK THE NUMBER IS APPROACHING 
FIFTEEN HUNDRED AFTER DAVE ITS FROM PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THE VIOLENCE 
SINCE THE ELECTION MAINLY BEATINGS 
TO THE BACK AND BUTTOCKS WE'VE 
SEEN BROKEN LIMBS WE'VE SEEN CUTS 
TO THE HEAD THE MOST EGREEDGEIOUS 
THING WAS AN EIGHTY PLUS YEAR OLD WOMAN 
SHE'S NOT CERTAIN OF HER AGE IT'S 
ESTIMATED SHE'S EIGHTY TO EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD 
SHE WAS HIT IN THE HEAD WITH AN AXE 
NOT BECAUSE OF ANYTHING SHE HAD 
DONE BUT BECAUSE HER TWO GRANDSONS 
WERE ACTIVISTS FOR THE M. D. C. PARTY 
AMBASSADOR JAMES MCGEE LEFT HARARE 
WITH COUNTERPARTS FROM BRITAIN 
JAPAN AND THE E. U. TO CHECK OUT THE 
SITUATION IN THE COUNTRYSIDE FOR 
THEMSELVES ACCORDING TO THE 
ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT THEY BROKE A 
RULE SAYING THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE 
GONE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILES FROM THE 
CAPITAL WITHOUT SPECIAL PERMISSION 
THEY WERE STOPPED THOUGH THE 
AMBASSADOR INSISTS THAT THE 
ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT WAS AT FAULT 
SO THERE WERE SIX DIPLOMATS IN THIS 
CONVOY THEY ILLEGAL ASKED US TO 
ACCOMPANY THEM TO A POLICE STATION 
WHICH CONTRAVENES ALL THE VIENNA 
CONVENTIONS THAT ANYONE KNOWS OF 
WE REFUELSED TO GO L. DID NOT GO TO 
A POLICE STATION IT'S ILLEGAL FOR 
THEM TO ASK THAT THERE WAS NO WAY 
WE WERE GOING TO A POLICE STATION 
WE WERE ILLEGALLY DETAINED ON THE 
SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR AN HOUR UNTIL 
THEY FOUND OUT THAT WE SHOULD GO 
AMBASSADOR MCGEE'S FINDINGS ARE 
BACKED UP BY THOSE OF THE BRITISH 
JOURNALIST PETER OBORNE SOME OF 
HIS PICTURES ARE VERY DISTURBING 
INDEED THIS IS A PICTURE YOU TOOK 
IN A HOSPITAL OF WOMAN VICTIM OF 
THE VIOLENCE WHAT ARE WE LOOKING 
AT HERE 
THESE ARE HER BUTTOCKS 
SHE WAS BEATEN WITH A ROD TWO 
PEOPLE TAKING TURNS TO BEAT HER FOR 
HALF AN HOUR IT'S GONE STRAIGHT 
THROUGH THE MUSCLE TISSUE 
DESTROYED THE MUSCLE TISSUE AND 
MADE TWO HOLES THE SIZE OF GRAPE 
FRUITS THERE ARE A LOT OF REPORTS 
OF INJURIES LIKE THAT COMING BACK 
BECAUSE THEY BEAT THEM SO HARD 
THERE'S A REAL PASSION AND FEROCITY 
ABOUT THIS A LOT OF PEOPLE GET 
BEATEN TO DEATH IT'S GOT TO BE 
BORNE IN MIND THIS IS PART OF AN 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN THIS IS PLANNED 
VIOLENCE PLANNED BY THE JOC THE 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF HARD LINERS 
TOP MILITARY MEN AND POLICEMEN WHO 
ARE LOYAL TO MUGABE THEY'RE GOING 
OUT THERE FIGHTING THEIR ELECTION 
BY DRIVING THE M. D. C. AWAY FROM THE 
PLACES WHERE THEY CAN VOTE 
TARGETING THE PARTY ORGANISATION 
SO THAT ANY M. D. C. ACTIVISTS OR 
ORGANISER WILL GET SOUGHT OUT AND 
EITHER KILLED OR BRUTALISED IT'S IT'S AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT 
ZIMBABWE NOW PREPARES FOR THE JUNE 
TWENTY SEVEN RUN OFF IN THE DISPUTED FIRST 
ROUND BACK IN MARCH PRESIDENT 
MUGABE AND HIS ZANU P. F. PARTY DID 
BADLY 
GREED TODAY IN A RARE 
ADMISSION 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ADMISSION OUR HISTORY WE HAVE LOST OUR 
MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT ALTHOUGH 
THE PRESIDENTIAL RESULT DID NOT 
YIELD AN OUTRIGHT WINNER IT WAS 
ALSO IT WAS INDEED DISASTROUS 
THE M. D. C.'S MORGAN TSVANGIRAI SECURED 
FORTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT PER CENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE BUT 
NEEDED OVER FIFTY PER CENT TO BE DECLARED THE 
WINNER HENCE THE RUN OFF HE'S 
BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY FOR OVER 
MONTH TRYING TO PUT PRESSURE ON 
REGIONAL LEAD NERZ SOUTHERN AFRICA 
THIS MORNING HE WAS IN BELFAST 
EXPRESSING HIS CONCERN AT THE 
VIOLENCE 
THE MOST APPALLING ACTS VIOLENCE OF BRUTALITY ARE BEING INFLICTED 
AGAINST INNOCENT CIVILIANS WHO 
DARED TO VOTE TO RID THEMSELVES OF 
THIS EVIL REGIME 
TONIGHT MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI'S FLYING BACK TO AFRICA 
IT'S THOUGHT HE COULD RETURN TO 
ZIMBABWE AT LONG LAST TOMORROW AND 
IS DUE TO ADDRESS A RALLY ON SUNDAY 
HE HAS LITTLE CHOICE BUT IT COULD 
BE A DANGEROUS MOVE 
HE MIGHT GET 
SHOT HE MIGHT GET ARRESTED ON 
ARRIVAL HE'S HAD DEATH THREATS 
VERY DELIBERATELY LAID AGAINST HIM 
SO IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS CAN 
THERE STILL BE FAIR ELECTION 
GIVEN THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND 
NO FAIR ELECTIONS ARE NOT POSSIBLE 
THERE NEEDS TO BE MUCH MUCH MORE 
POLITICAL SPACE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO 
DO TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE THE 
PEOPLE NEED TO BE ASSURED THAT 
THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY SEN SURED 
TODAY AMBASSADOR JAMES MCGEE WAS 
GIVEN FIRST WARNING BY ZIMBABWE'S 
FOREIGN MINISTER AND TOLD THAT ANY 
INTERFERENCE IN ZIMBABWE'S INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED 
WILF MBANGA IS THE EDITOR OF THE 
ZIMBABWEAN PAPER HE WAS EXPELLED 
FROM ZIMBABWE THANKS FOR JOINING 
US THIS EVENING AMNESTY 
INTERNATIONAL SAYS THAT THE 
VIOLENCE IN YOUR COUNTRY IS AT 
BREAKING POINT FROM WHAT YOU KNOW 
FROM PEOPLE BACK HOME HOW 
WIDESPREAD IS THIS IT'S IT'S COUNTRYWIDE FIRST OF ALL I WASN'T 
EXPELLED FROM ZIMBABWE I LEFT ON 
MY OWN AFTER BEING ARRESTED THE 
VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE IS NOW 
COUNTRYWIDE IT'S BEING COORDINATED 
AT THE VERY HIGHEST LEVEL WE'VE 
GOT THE JOINT OPERATIONS COMMAND 
COMPRISING THE CHIEFS OF THE 
DEFENCE FORCES THEY ARE 
SUPERVISING A NUMBER OF GENERALS 
AND POLICE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONERS 
AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ARE 
DIRECTING THE OPERATIONS OF THE WAR 
VETERANS AND ZANU P. F. THUGS SOME OF 
WHOM HAVE NOW BEEN GIVEN GUNS AND 
ARE NOW WALKING AROUND IN UNIFORM 
OR POLICE UNIFORM 
AS YOU POINT OUT 
THIS IS PART OF AN ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN IF THE RUN OFF ISN'T 
UNTIL THE END OF JUNE THERE'S A 
FAIR CHANCE THIS KIND OF 
INTIMIDATION WILL WORK AT THE POLLS 
WELL WHAT MUGABE IS TRYING TO DO 
IS TO DISPLACE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND VOTERS BECAUSE HE LOST TO 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI BY THAT MUCH 
MAJORITY SO HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE 
THAT HE DISPLACES FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
IN OTHER WORDS THEY WON'T BE 
ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN THE NEXT 
ELECTION THAT WAY HE'LL GET IN 
THAT'S PART OF HIS STRATEGY WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU ACTUALLY ADVICE THEN 
ADVISE THEN IS IT A MISTAKE FOR 
THE M. D. C. TO TAKE PART IN THE RUN OFF 
AT ALL DOES THAT LEGITIMISE HIS 
PLAN 
THE PROBLEM IS DAMNED IF HE PLAN DOES AND DAMNED IF HE DOESN'T IF 
HE TAKES PART IN THE ELECTION SOME 
PEOPLE HAVE SAID HE'S LEGITIMISING 
THIS ILLEGAL PROCESS BUT IF HE 
DOESN'T THEN MUGABE GETS IN BY 
DEFAULT THEN WE HAVE MORE 
SUFFERING FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
IS THAT WHAT WE WANT 
I GUESS THE 
POINT THAT HAS BEEN MADE IS THAT 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY YOU 
BELIEVE THEY HAVE TO ACT NOW TAKE 
US INSIDE THE MINDS OF THE M. D. C. HOW 
EXASPERATED ARE THEY IN PARTICULAR 
TO SOUTH AFRICA'S RESPONSE TO THIS 
SITUATION 
YOU KNOW THAT THEY'VE SITUATION ALREADY SAID THAT THEY DON'T THINK 
MBEKI IS AN HONEST BROKER HE'S 
ADMITTED THAT HE'S BEEN BACKING 
MUGABE ALL ALONG 
DO THEY THINK 
ANYONE ELSE WOULD DO BETTER 
THEY'VE SUGGESTED THE ZAMBIAN 
PRESIDENT WHO IS ALSO THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE SADEC REGION BUT SHE'S 
UNACCEPTED TO MUGABE SO IT'S NOT 
GOING TO WORK SADC ITSELF IS 
APPOINTED MBEKI AS THEIR POINT MEN 
IT'S WITH MBEKI BUT MBEKI HAS 
DISCREDITED HIMSELF HIS OWN PARTY 
IS DISTANCING ITSELF FROM HIM HE'S 
BEEN A DISASTER 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
MONITORS THEY THEMSELVES ARE BEING 
INTIMIDATED UNDER THIS ROUND WHAT 
CHANCE IS THERE OF GETTING A FAIR 
RESULT SECOND TIME ROUND WELL WELL THERE ARE TWO MONITORS 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND LOCAL 
OBSERVERS OF THE LOCAL OBSERVERS 
RIGHT NOW THE SUPERVISORY 
COMMISSION TOLD US THAT TWO HUNDRED OF 
THEIR MEMBERS HAVE EITHER BEEN 
ASSAULTED OR VERY BADLY BEATEN OR 
ARE IN HOSPITAL HAVE FLED THEIR 
HOMES SOME OF THE LOCAL OBSERVERS 
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN 
THE NEXT ROUND AS FOR THE FOREIGN 
OBSERVERS THEY'VE DISGRACED 
THEMSELVES THEY OUGHT TO BE 
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES THE WAY THEY 
CONDUCTED THEMSELVES LAST TIME 
THEY WERE VERY QUICK TO POINT OUT 
THAT THE ELEKS HAD BEEN FREE AND 
FAIR BUT RIGHT NOW BOTH ZANU P. F. 
AND THE M. D. C. ARE CONTESTING THE 
RESULT THEY'RE BOTH SAYING THE 
ELECTIONS WERE NOT FREE AND FAIR 
O. K. 
THEY NOW LOOK SILLY 
THANK YOU O. K. VERY MUCH 
TO CONTEMPLATE A NATURAL DISASTER 
WITH THE DEATH TOLL IN THE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS IS HORRIFIC TO 
CONTEMPLATE TWO IS PRETTY MUCH 
UNTHINKABLE AS CHINA BEGINS TO 
BURY ITS DEAD AND BURMA'S REGIME 
ADMITS THE DEATH TOLL HAS RISEN 
SHARPLY WE ASK HOW THE DISASTERS 
MAY CHANGE THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED 
LONGER TERM WE ASSESS THEIR 
SITUATION T. H. REPORT CONTAINS 
DISTRESSING PICTURES 
THE REPORT CONTAINS DISTRESSING 
PICTURES A FORTNIGHT ON 
AND AND 
THERE ARE MANY PARTS OF BURMA 
WHERE TWENTY FIVE MILLION SURVIVORS CLING 
TO LIFE WITHOUT NO OUTSIDE HELP IN 
LAPUTTA VILLAGERS MAKE TERRIBLE 
DISCOVERY IN THE SCHOOL PARENTS 
WHO HOPED THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT HAVE 
SURVIVED ARE DASHED CONTINUING 
RAIN MAKES IT WORSE AS IS A 
MILITARY GOVERNMENT DRAWING 
WIDESPREAD INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM 
WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A CATASTROPHE 
SUCH A DEVASTATION YOU NEED HELP 
FROM OUTSIDE THE CAN'T DO A IT 
ALONE IT IS A VERY OF EMERGENCY 
IN FACT TIME IS LIFE IF THEY 
DON'T DON'T REALISE THAT THEY WILL 
CONSIDER BEING RESPONSIBLE THE 
WORST HIT PART OF BURMA IS THE 
IRRAWADDY DELTA A VAST POPULOUS 
AND USUALLY FERTILE PLACE WATER 
DOMINATES EVERYTHING HERE ALL THE 
MORE SO NOW BRIDGES HAVE BEEN SWEPT 
AWAY AND POWER SUPPLY LOST AND 
THE GOVERNMENT CLOSED THE AREA OFF 
TO OUTSIDE EXPERTS UP TO NOW EVEN EVEN THIS AFTERNOON IT WAS MADE CLEAR 
THAT ALL NATIONAL MEMBERS OF STAFF 
WILL HAVE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE 
AREAS THAT IS A VERY GOOD 
DEVELOPMENT FOR US WE HOPE THAT 
WILL SPEED UP THE AID EFFORTS OF 
MANY AID ORGANISATIONS AND 
LOGISTICS ARE A HUGE PROBLEM 
PARTICULARLY BOATS BOATS ARE THE 
NUMBER ONE CON SKRAIPBT TO SPEEDING 
UP THE RELIEF EFFORTS CON 
STRAINT 
IN BURMA EVEN THE DEATH STRAINT TOLL HAVE BEEN CLOUDED BY NATURE 
AND THE REGIME'S SECRETIVENESS THE 
GOVERNMENT SAID NEARLY SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND HAD 
DIED MANY FOREIGN AGENCIES 
SUGGESTED THE FIGURE IS UP TO 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THE BRITISH OFFICE 
SUGGESTED UP TO TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND MAY HAVE 
DIED EVEN AS EUROPEAN ENVOYS BEAT 
A PATH TO THE BURMESE CAPITAL 
PRESSING FOR ACCESS THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS DECLARED THE RELIEF PHASE OVER 
IN CHINA BOTH THE SCALE OF THE 
DISASTER AND THE RESCUE EFFORT ARE 
PLAYED OUT UNDER THE WORLD'S GAZE 
THIS FIVE YEAR OLD A SURVIVOR GETS 
THE ODDS AT BAICHIAN THE QUAKE'S 
EPICENTRE CHINESE T. V. HAS BEEN 
SCREENING SCENES LIKE FOR THE PAST 
FEW DAYS A STORY OF HOPE AND 
ALSO MASSIVE MILITARY AND CIVIL 
EFFORT BY A REGIME THAT KNOWS IT'S 
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THEIR RESPONSE 
VERY CLOSELY 
THEY FEEL THE RISK OF 
POPULAR ANGER AND RESENTMENT ABOUT 
WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE OF COURSE IT 
IS NOT THEIR FAULT THERE'S A 
NATURAL DISASTER LIKE A EARTHQUAKE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF PEASANTS 
AND ORDINARY WORKERS WILL BE 
THINKING WHY DO SCHOOLS FALL IN 
WHEN BUILDINGS THE SAME HEIGHTS 
DON'T FALL IN WHY ARE WE GIVEN A 
WARNING OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY DAMS THAT MIGHT 
BURST WHY DO BRIDGES FALL IN AND 
HOSPITALS AT RISK WHY ARE 
BUILDINGS BUILT BY THE STATE 
COLLAPSING WHILE OTHERS ARE 
STANDING EVERYONE KNOWS THAT PALM 
HAVE BE AGREESED 
HU JINTAO CHINA'S 
PRESIDENT FOLLOWED HIS PRIME 
MINISTER IN VISITING THE DISASTER 
AREA OUR IS GROWING ABOUT THE 
RELIEF EFFORT AS A BRITISH TEACHER 
IN CHENGDU EXPLAINS 
THE KALE OF 
THE SCALE OF THE THING AND THE 
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IS NOT ENOUGH THE 
TWO PEOPLE THEY FOUND THEY HEARD 
AT EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE MORNING THEY DIDN'T 
GET THERE UNTIL THREE HUNDRED BY THAT TIME 
IT WAS TOO LATE 
CHINA'S DISASTER 
HIT THE SICHUAN PROVINCE HARDEST 
THE OFFICIAL DEATH TOLL 
APOLOGIES FOR THE EARLIER LOSS OF 
SUBTITLES IN BURMA IT WILL SEEM 
THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP FEELS MORE 
SURE IT CAN WELCOME POPULAR 
SUFFERING 
CHINA IS WHERE THE SUFFERING BURMESE ARE TODAY ONLY THIRTY YEARS AGO 
A HUGE EARTHQUAKE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX IN THE 
NORTHEAST OF CHINA NO ONE WAS 
ALLOWED IN THERE WAS NO REPORTING 
IT WAS A SIMILAR SCALE OF CARNAGE 
AS TODAY THAT WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX MAO HAD 
JUST DIED A SIMILAR APPROACH TO 
WHAT THE BURMESE JUNTA ARE DOING 
TODAY 
AT MIANY YAN THEY HAVE TODAY ESTABLISHED A REFUGE FOR PUPILS OF 
THE SCHOOL WHERE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND 
STUDENTS WERE BURIED THE 
EARTHQUAKE HAS TOUCHED SUCH DEEP 
EMOTIONS IN CHINA THERE ARE BOUND 
TO BE AFTERSHOCKS SOCIAL AND 
POLITICAL BATINA LUSHA FROM THE 
WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME JOINS ME 
LOOKING AT BURMA THIS TIME LAST 
WEEK THE SITUATION GRAVE FOOD 
IMPOUNDED BY THE AUTHORITIES WHO 
WANTED TO STOP NORTHERN AID GETTING 
IN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT SITUATION 
HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED NOW WE WE ARE GETTING FOOD TO THE PEOPLE BY 
NOW WE HAVE BROUGHT FOOD TO AT 
LEAST ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WE ARE 
WORKING ON THE GROUND WITH OUR AID 
WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A 
LONG TIME WE WERE ABLE TO BRING IN 
ANOTHER TEN AID WORKERS AND WE'RE 
WORKING WITH LOCAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL NGO'S WHO THEN BRING 
THE FOOD TO THE PEOPLE ON THE 
GROUND SO IT HAS IMPROVED BUT 
NEVERTHELESS WE WOULD LOVE TO DO 
MUCH MUCH MORE 
CLEARLY WE ARE 
ONLY AT TWENTY PER CENT OF CAPACITY AND OUR 
NUMBER ONE GOAL IS TO FEED THE 
HUNGARY ARE YOU HEARING A 
HUNGARY ARE YOU HEARING A 
SOFTENING FROM THE AUTHORITIES 
WHAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE 
WE'RE ALWAYS IN CONTACT WITH THE 
AUTHORITIES AND OFFICIALS IN 
MYANMAR OUR PEOPLE ON THE GROUND 
WE WOULD LIKE TO BRING FOR EXAMPLE 
A HELICOPTER TO TRANSPORT FOOD TO 
THE FAR OUTLYING AREAS WHICH ARE SO 
HARD TO ACCESS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE 
TO GET SOME BOATS AND THEY DELIVER 
FOOD TO SOME OF THESE AREAS WE 
HAVE BEEN HIRING TRUCKS BUT THEY 
ARE ONLY SMALL TRUCKS WE CAN ONLY 
CARRY FIVE TONNES OR SO DESPITE DESPITE YOUR EFFORTS THIS IS A DROP IN THE 
OCEAN GIVEN HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU'RE 
NOT REACHING WHAT DOES IT TAKE NOW 
FOR YOU TO REACH THE MAJORITY WELL WELL WE WOULD LIKE TO DO MUCH MORE AND 
SO WE CAN KEEP ON TALKING TO THE 
AUTHORITIES AS YOU KNOW SEVERAL 
UN ENVOYS ARE ON THE WAY AND WILL 
HAVE TO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND WE'RE 
HOPING TO HAVE AN AIR BRIDGE FROM 
BANGKOK TO BRING IN MUCH MORE AND 
WE'RE HOPING THAT REALLY WE CAN GET 
ALL THE FOOD TO THE PEOPLE SEE 
THE SITUATION NOW IS ALSO 
COMPLICATED BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE THE 
PEOPLE HAVE LOST NOT JUST THEIR 
FOOD AS RESERVES BUT ALSO THE 
SEEDS FOR THE RICE FIELDS WE'RE 
VERY CONCERNED THAT THE NEXT 
HARVEST WILL NOT HAPPEN WE'RE 
PLANNING FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OF 
A VERY LARGE AID OPERATION 
THEREFORE WE WOULD LIKE TO DO MUCH 
MORE 
IF THE NICE DECADE AS MERVYN MORE KING WOULD SAY IS TRULY BEHIND US 
WHAT EXACTLY NEEDS TO CHANGE ONE 
LEADING ECONOMIST A KNOW BELL 
PRIZE WINNER HAS THROWN UP A 
CONCEPT THE BANK OF ENGLAND MAY 
FIND IMPOSSIBLE TO STOMACH THE END 
OF THE INFLATION TARGET JOSEPH 
STIGLITZ ARGUES IT IS A CRUDE 
MECHANISM THAT COULD CRIPPLE THE 
ECONOMY ECONOMY FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST THE 
NICE DECADE IS BEHIND US THE THE CREDIT CYCLE HAS TURNED COMMODITY 
PRICES ARE RISING WE'RE TRAVELLING 
ALONG A BUMPY ROAD AS THE ECONOMY 
REBALANCES MONETARY POLICY CAN NOT 
AND SHOULD NOT TRY TO PREVENT THAT 
ADJUSTMENT 
WHEN THEY WRITE THE ADJUSTMENT ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE NEXT DECADE 
THEY WILL PROBABLY STILL BE QUOTING 
THAT WHAT IT MEANS IS AN ECONOMIC 
DOWN TURN IS COMING BUT NOBODY IS 
GOING TO USE INTEREST RATES TO STOP 
IT AND SOFTEN IT HERE IS WHY WHAT 
MERVYN KING MEANS BY THE NICE 
DECADE IS NON INFLATIONARY 
CONTINUOUS EXPANSION THAT'S WHAT 
WE HAVE HAD SINCE ONE NINE EIGHT NINE SEVEN 
UNDERPINNING IT HAS BEEN AN 
INFLATION TARGET THE BANK HAS 
RAISE INTEREST RATES IF TOO HIGH 
AND CUT THEM IF TOO LOW IT'S A 
SYMMETRICAL TARGET IT CAN GO AS 
HIGH AS THREE PER CENT AND AS LOW AS ONE PER CENT FOR 
TEN YEARS IT WORKED HERE IS WHAT 
C. P. I. INFLATION LOOKED LIKE SINCE 
LABOUR HAS BEEN IN POWER FOR YEARS 
IT WAS BELOW TWO PER CENT IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND FIVE IT 
HIT TWO PER CENT LAST YEAR IT HIT THREE PER CENT NOW 
IT'S UP AND PREDICTED TO HIT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT 
IN AUGUST THE DEBATE ON WHAT TO DO 
ABOUT IT RESOLVES ABOUT WHAT CAUSED 
THE SPIKE THE FIRST CLUE CHINA 
SWITCHED FROM HAVING A DOWNWARD 
IMPACT ON GLOBAL PRICES TO A 
INFLATIONARY ONE CHINA'S DEMAND 
FOR OIL AND STEEL HAS PUSHED PRICES 
UP AND OIL THE RISE OF THE 
DEVELOPING WORLD IS CREATING A 
MISMATCH BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
WHEN LABOUR CAME INTO OFFICE THE 
PRICE OF A BARREL OF OIL IN NEW 
YORK WAS NINETEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS TODAY IT WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS 
AND THAT HAS DOUBLED IN THE LAST 
YEAR WHEN GORDON BROWN DESIGNED 
THE MONETARY POLICY SYSTEM THE 
THEORY WAS SETTING AN INFLATION 
TARGET WOULD ENCOURAGE STEADY 
GROWTH AND HIGH EMPLOYMENT AND THAT 
CREATES THE LONG TERM CONDITIONS 
FOR LOW INFLATION NOW WE HAVE BIG 
INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COMING FROM 
OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THAT 
SAYS DAVID BLANCHEFLOWER HIGH 
INTEREST RATES RISK DRIVING THE U. K. 
INTO RECESSION HE HAS CALLED FOR 
RAPID INTEREST RATE RATES RATE 
CUTS NOBODY IN POLITICS WANT TO 
LOOK SOFT ON INFLATION EARLIER I 
SPOKE TO PROFESSOR JOSEPH STIGLITZ 
FROM PARIS L. ASKED HIM IF HE 
THOUGHT THE BANK OF ENGLAND WAS 
FOCUSSING ON THE WRONG THING I I THINK INFLATION TARGETING IS A 
SURELY A MISTAKE IN THE CURRENT 
CONTEXT INFLATION TARGETING WAS 
NEVER FULLY JUSTIFIED IN TERMS OF 
ECONOMIC THEORY BUT WHEN THE 
SOURCES OF INFLATION ARE EXTERNAL 
IMPORTED INFLATION ENERGY PRICES 
FOOD PRICES IT SEEMS TO ME FAIRLY 
FOOLISH O. TO FOCUS ON MAKING THE 
REST OF THE ECONOMY PAY THE PRICE 
FOR THE DISTURBANCES THE SHOCKS 
THAT ARE COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE 
ABOUT WHICH YOU CAN DO NOTHING 
ISN'T INFLATION JUSTIFIABLE FEAR 
THE TARGET WE HAVE SET HAS SERVED 
THE COUNTRY EXTREMELY WELL FOR THE 
PAST DECADE WHAT TIMES ARE GOOD IT 
HAS WORKED WHY WOULD YOU GET RID 
OF IT 
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY YOU 
WANT TO GET RID OF THE WHOLE IDEA 
WHAT IS CLEAR YOU NEED TO ADJUST 
THE APPROPRIATE INFLATION TARGET 
IF YOU'LL STICK WITHIN THE 
INFLATION TARGETING FRAMEWORK FOR 
INSTANCE WE KNOW NO MATTER WHAT YOU 
DO YOU'LL BE FACED WITH INCREASES 
IN THE PRICE OF ENERGY AND THE 
PRICE OF FOOD AND THOSE INCREASES 
WILL FEED THROUGH THE SYSTEM NOW 
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO STRANGLE THE 
REST OF THE ECONOMY IN ORDER TO GET 
INFLATION DOWN TO A MYTH KAEL ASH 
TRARLY CHOSEN NUMBER IT MAKES IT 
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE ECONOMY TO 
GO THROUGH THE ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED 
ARBITRARY ARE YOU SAYING WE SHOULD 
USE ANOTHER ARBITRARY NUMBER WHAT 
WOULD IT BE 
YOU HAVE TO RECOGNISE 
UFR FACING A SITUATION WHERE SOME 
OF THE PRICES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY 
ESSENTIAL FOR AN ECONOMY FOOD AND 
ENERGY ARE GOING UP NOT BECAUSE OF 
ANYTHING YOU HAVE DONE DONE WRONG 
YOU WANT TO OF COURSE TO MAKE SURE 
THAT IT DOESN'T GET BUILT INTO AN 
INFLATION MOMENTIM A INFLATION 
NERB YA INERTIA BUT ON THE OTHER 
HAND TO STRANGLE THE REST OF THE 
ECONOMY THE NON TRADING SECTOR 
JUST TO ACHIEVE A ARBITRARY GOAL IS 
FOOLISH 
YOU KNOW POLITICALLY THAT FOOLISH IS DEATH IF MERVYN KING THE 
GOVERNOR OR THE TREASURY SAID LET'S 
ADJUST THE INFLATION TARGET WE 
WOULD LAUGH IN HIS FACE WON'T WE 
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS COUNTRIES 
MADE A MISTAKE TO GET TO WEDDED TO 
THE NOTION OF INFLATION TARGETING 
THEY SHOULD HAVE SAID IT'S ONE OF 
THE OBJECTIVES THEY WILL GET 
VERY IMPORTANT ONE THE FEDERAL 
RESERVE BOARD IN THE UNITED STATES 
HAS FOCUSED ON INFLATION BUT ALSO 
ON UNEMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC 
GROWTH AND THAT IS WHY RIGHT NOW 
IT SEES THE DANGERS OF RECESSION 
ARE MUCH GREATER THAN INFLATION IT 
AND IT LOWERED THE INTEREST RATES 
MARKEDLY IN RESPONSE TO THAT WHAT 
IT IS SAYING IS POLICY IS 
AN IMPORTANT TOOL BUT IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO KEEP IT FLEXIBLE IF IF YOU WERE MERVYN KING NOW DO YOU 
BELIEVE YOU COULD CHANGE THE TARGET 
THE INDEX WITHOUT FUNDAMENTALLY 
SPOOKING THE MARKET 
IF YOU EXPLAIN 
WHAT IS GOING ON I THINK THE 
ANSWER IS YES L. THINK TACTICALLY 
SPEAKING PROBABLY THE EASIEST 
STRATEGY IS TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO 
FOLLOW THE AMERICAN EXAMPLE AND GO 
TO CORE INFLATION THERE ARE 
SEVERAL REASONS FOR DOING THIS YOU 
COULD EXPLAIN THE VOLATILITY OF THE 
FOOD AND ENERGY MARKET L. WOULD 
ALSO BEGIN TALKING ABOUT THE NOTION 
OF IMPORTED INFLATION THAT IN A 
WORLD OF GLOBALISATION AND A WORLD 
OF OPEN ECONOMIES MONETARY POLICY 
HAS TO BE MORE NUANCED THAN IT WAS 
IN A CLOSED ECONOMY
