BECAUSE OF THE LONGER DISTANCE 
BECAUSE IT IS IN SHEFFIELD AT THE 
CRUCIBLE KISS THE BEST VENUE WE 
PLAYING IN MY OPINION SO TO 
STEPHANIE A SPECIAL OCCASION AND IT 
TENDS TO 
BRING THE 
BEST OUT OF THE 
TOP PLAYERS 
THE TOURNAMENT FIRST 
OF THIRTEEN COMET IS LIKE THREE SESSIONS 
AND IT IS GREAT 
STEPHEN IS PLAYING 
SO WELL FOR ME I WILL BE GOING 
OUT THERE GIVING IT MY BEST IF I 
CAN PLAY REALLY WELL THERE IS NO 
REASON WHY I CAN'T WIN 
NEIL PACE 
AND OPEN GAME AND I PLAY AN OPEN 
GAME I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE 
PLAYS AN OPEN GAME WE WILL OPEN 
THE REDS UP AND GET ON 
A WE ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD 
TO WHAT IS ONE OF THE TIES OF THE 
SECOND ROUND BETWEEN A COMBUSTIBLE 
PLANT GLASWEGIAN STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
AND THE EVER CONFIDENT AUSTRALIAN 
NEIL ROBERTSON THESE ARE TWO OF 
THE LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT OF THE SPORT 
AND ARE GETTING BETTER WITH EVERY 
PASSING YEAR ROUND TWO BEST OF TWENTY FIVE 
MATCHES WE ARE GOING TO GET INTO 
IT IN FRAME TWO STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
HAVING WON THE FIRST HE IS SIX 
POINTS UP HERE AND WILLIE THORNE 
AND NEAL FOULDS WILL TAKE US 
THROUGH IT 
THAT LITTLE TAP ON THE TABLE HE IS 
ANGRY WITH THAT ONE BECAUSE HE KNEW 
IT WAS A GOOD DANGEROUS IN THE 
FIRST PLACE 
I WONDER 
WHY 
THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH THE RISK IF 
YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY IT HE DID 
NEAR JAW WAY NEAR JAW HIT IT 
NEAR JAW HE WOULD LOVE TO PLAY THE 
CANNON INTO THE TWO REDS OFF THIS 
RED BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ANGLE 
ON THE RED TO DO THAT 
TO EITHER OF THESE TWO REDS POT IN 
THE MIDDLE POCKET BY THE PINK 
AND TO EITHER OF THESE 
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY DO THIS 
IS THE KEY SHOT HE HAS TO POT IT 
AND GET A HALF BALL ANGLE ON THE 
BLACK SO 
HE 
CAN PLAY 
FOR THE TWO 
REDS THIS COULD BE 
EITHER A 
FRAME 
WINNER OR A FRAME LOSER 
ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS VERY CLOSE 
RATTLED IN THE JAWS 
WE HAVE SEEN A FEW IN THIS FRAME 
LIKE THAT THIS IS A GOOD CHANCE 
NOW CANNON 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 
WHEN YOU 
DO PLAY THAT SHOT PLAY IT A LITTLE 
BIT FIRM YOU DON'T WANT TO BE JUST 
RESTING ON THE OTHER RED YOU WANT 
TO GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE OF 
GETTING THE WHITER AWAY FROM BOTH 
REDS JUST IN CASE YOU DON'T GET THE 
PERFECT KISS THAT 
HE PLAYED 
AT THE PACE HE DID 
THE GREEN WILL 
COME INTO THIS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
THIS IS THE SHOT NOW PERHAPS HE 
MIGHT FEEL HE HAS THE ANGLE OF THE 
RED TO PLAY OFF THE CUSHION AND 
DEVELOP THE GREEN HE NEEDS THE 
GREEN FOR THE FRAME DON'T FORGET 
A LITTLE UCKY THAT IS ABOUT THE 
ONLY CASE WHERE HE HAS GOT TO DO 
PLENTY WITH THE CUE BALL AND 
OBVIOUSLY TO GET ONTO THE YELLOW 
NOW HE 
IS GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY 
THE BLUE AT PACE HE IS PROBABLY 
THINKING OF PLAYING YELLOW OR BROWN 
BOTH OF WHICH ARE TOUGH 
HAS HE MISSED THE PINK HAS HE 
MISSED THE GREEN HE HAS MISSED 
THEM BOTH JUST WANTED ANOTHER FOOT 
OF PACE DIDN'T HE YOU WOULD NOT 
LIKE TO POT THESE EVERY DAY FOR 
YOUR LIVING THIS IS TOUGH THE THE OTHER THING NOT SURE IF HE CAN GET 
FROM YELLOW TO GREEN CAN HE 
HE DIDN'T GO FOR THAT HE WASN'T 
STRAIGHT THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE 
SHOT FROM YELLOW TO GREEN HENCE 
THE REASON HE PLAYED SAFE 
NO POINT IN TAKING THE YELLOW ONE 
BECAUSE HE CAN'T STAY AT THIS END 
OF THE 
TABLE FOR THE GREEN EVEN 
LOWER THOUGH THERE ARE NINE 
POINTS IN IT WHOEVER POTS THIS YOU 
WOULD THINK WOULD GO ON TO WIN THE 
FRAME HE HAS HIT IT TOO THIN THAT 
IS A BAD SHOT L. MENTIONED EARLIER 
ON IN COMMENTARY ONE OF THE GAME'S 
GREAT POTTERS ONE OF THE BEST 
BREAK BUILDERS HAS TO IMPROVE IN 
OTHER DEPARTMENTS 
HE WAS THE WRONG SIDE OF STRAIGHT 
HE CONTROLLED IT NICELY SLIGHTLY 
BETTER SHOT THAN IT LOOKED 
FIRST FRAME MAGUIRE DESERVE IT 
WINNER THIS GAME ROBERTSON WILL 
BE DISAPPOINTED DESERVED WINNER 
ONE TO THREE FAVOURITE MAGUIRE IN THIS MATCH 
WHICH IS JUST ABOUT RIGHT 
TWENTY TWO IN FRONT BLACKS SAFE WILL HE 
COME BACK TO THE TABLE 
A BIT UNLUCKY REALLY THINKING 
ABOUT WHERE STEPHEN COULD PUT THE 
CUE BALL IN THE DEEP AND BE ON THE 
RED OVER 
THE POCKET I DON'T THINK 
HE CAN YOU KNOW THE IN OFF IS A 
POSSIBLE OVER IN THE D. 
THIS IS A BOLD ONE TO TAKE ON 
BECAUSE HE WILL BE 
ON THE 
BACK BUT 
IF HE MISSES IT COULD DO UNTOLD 
DAMAGE 
WHEN YOU ARE CUEING LIKE THAT WHAT 
A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES THAT WAS TOP 
DRAWER YOU DESERVE WHATEVER YOU 
GET AFTER A SHOT LIKE THAT WORTH WORTH ANOTHER LOOK WASN'T IT TERRIFIC 
THOSE ARE THE SHOT THAT MAKE YOU 
FEEL GREAT ABOUT YOUR GAME YOU GET 
ONE OF THOSE AND YOU FEEL TEN F. T. 
TALL OUT THERE 
AND I JUST WONDER WHERE THE SPOT 
WILL GO MIKHAIL IT HAD JUST SIZING 
IT UP IT IS ACTUALLY ON THE SPOT 
MICHAELA TABB 
HE HAD A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF A 
MAXIMUM THIS WEEK WHEN HE GOT DOWN 
TO THE FOURTEENTH OR FIFTEENTH RED IT IS JUST 
A CASE OF FINISHING LOW ON THIS 
NEXT BLACK AND PUSHING THOSE REDS 
ARE AWAY FROM THE BLACK THE BALLS 
LOOK VERY NICE THIS IS THE KEY SHOT 
HE WILL NOT BE IN TOTAL CONTROL AS 
TO WHERE HE PUSHES THE CUE BALL 
HERE 
IT MUST HAVE TO GET IT TO RUN 
THROUGH NOW HE IS GETTING AWAY 
FROM THE BLACK 
HE HAS GONE TOO FAR BY QUITE A LONG 
WAY 
ONE OF THE GAME'S REALLY HIGH BREAK 
BUILDERS STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
WHEN HE GETS IN AND HE KNOWS HIS 
WAY AROUND THE BLACK SPOT AREA 
URGE ANYONE OUT THERE THAT WANTS TO 
BECOME BETTER YOU WANT TO GO AND 
PLAY WITH A GREAT PLAYER IF YOU GET 
A CHANCE PLAY WAS SOMEONE WHO 
KNOWS WHAT 
THEY HAVE 
DONE WITH THE 
CUE BALL SOMEONE HE BREAK BILLS A 
BIT OF PETULANCE THERE HE WAS NOT 
HAPPY WITH THAT SHOT WHO BREAK 
BUILDS 
WHEN YOU WATCH THE TOP PLAYERS 
PLAYING THE BREAK BUILDING IS THE 
KEY TO THE SCORE MAGUIRE KNOWS HIS 
WAY AROUND 
YOU CAN SEE HIS ANNOYANCE THAT HE 
MISSED IT WAS A CHANCE THE FRAME 
IS STILL IN PLAY THERE IS HIS 
REACTION HE IS FUMING ABOUT THAT 
I THING HE IS THE KIND OF PLAYER 
WILLIE HE GETS ANNOYED WITH 
HIMSELF IT IS NOT SO MUCH BAD LUCK 
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT HE SETS 
HIMSELF A HIGH STANDARD AND GET 
REALLY ANGRY WITH HIMSELF WHEN HE 
MISSES 
A YES I HAVE GOT TO BE MISSES HONEST I DON'T LIKE IT L. DON'T 
THINK IT SHOWS RESPECT TO YOUR 
OPPONENT YES BUT HE IS A 
LIKEABLE YOUNG MAN HE HAS SO MUCH 
PRIDE IN HIS PERFORMANCE HE JUST 
WANTS TO PLAY WELL ALL THE TIME 
THIS IS A TOUGH GAME 
MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE WON THE LAST 
FRAME HE HAS BEEN GIVEN HALF A 
CHANCE TO PINCH THIS ONE HE HAS 
NOT BEEN OUTPLAYED HE HAS TO 
SCORER A LITTLE SCORER LITTLE SCORER A LITTLE 
THE FACT THAT NEAL IS LEFT HANDED 
AS WELL ALL THOSE FIVE REDS ARE 
NOT IN HIS FAVOUR NEAL ROBERTSON 
HE WILL WANT TO PLAY ON THEM 
WITHOUT USING THE REST THE WORK STARTS NOW 
WELL HE HAS ASKED FOR THE CUE BALL 
TO BE CLEANED HE HAS FINISHED 
ABOUT TWO FEET SHORT OF HIS 
INTENDED POSITION 
I THINK HE TRIED 
TO SCREW IN RIGHT BEHIND 
REDS LET US 
LOOK AT 
THAT AGAIN IT 
SOUNDED HEAVY YOU 
DON'T GET 
KICKS 
SOUNDED HEAVY YOU DON'T GET KICKS QUITE SO MUCH ON 
SCREW SHOTS 
NORMALLY 
ON RUN 
THROUGH AS YOU GET 
SOME HE IS WAY SHORT IT IS VERY 
NARROW ANGLE NORMALLY ON RUN 
THROUGHS 
WELL THAT IS A FABULOUS RECOVERY 
THAT WAS A HORRIBLE SHOT TO PLAY 
HE WOULD LIKE TO PLAY A SIMILAR 
SHOT TO WHAT HE PLAYED BEFORE L. 
DON'T THINK HE CAN SCREW DIRECT IF 
HE PLAYS THE SCREW SHOT HE WILL BE 
TRYING TO MOVE A RED OUT 
NO MATTER HOW GOOD OR BAD YOU ARE 
YOU CANNOT MISS THOSE UP GOES THE 
SCREEN THEY HAVE GOT NOW THIS 
WONDERFUL THEATRE TO THEMSELVES 
THE MATCH HAS FINISHED ON THE OTHER 
TABLE THIS IS NO THE ARENA OF 
DREAMS REALLY WHEN YOU HAVE GOT 
THIS SITUATION THIS IS NOW 
YOU JUST GET THE FEELING THAT NEAL 
ROBERTSON HASN'T QUITE GOT GOING 
TODAY HE HASN'T REALLY SETTLED 
INTO THE MATCH FRAME TO HE SHOULD 
HAVE WON HE MISSED THAT PINK 
KNOW IT IS A LONG MATCH BUT YOU 
CANNOT GO THREE OR FOUR DOWN 
AGAINST SOMEONE OF HIS OPPONENT'S 
STATURE 
A THIRTY POINT LEAD MAGUIRE IS THE 
STRONG FAVOURITE 
THAT IS A TERRIFIC SHOT HE IS NOW 
ON THE BLACK THAT WAS WORTH 
ANOTHER GLANCE IT WAS A GOOD IDEA 
AS WELL HE COULD ONLY LEAVE THE 
RED THAT HE PLAYED AM NOT SURE 
WHETHER NEXT RED IS GOING TO COME 
FROM MIND YOU THAT IS A NON 
STARTER 
THERE 
IS A SHOT ON BUT IT STARTER IS FAR TOO RISKY HE COULD PLAY THE 
SCREW SHOT AND COME BACK DOWN TO 
CANNON THE REDS BUT YOU WOULD 
PROBABLY BE TO OUT OF TEN GETTING 
THAT GETTING THE KISS IS EVEN 
HARDER LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD 
IS THERE ANY ADVANTAGE IN BRINGING 
THE PINK OUT L. DON'T THINK THAT IS 
A BAD MOVE BRINGING THE PINK OUT 
AND TRY TO GET IT BEHIND THE BROWN 
OR YOU CAN ROLL IN BEHIND THE BLACK 
HE IS GOING FOR THE BROWN WHERE 
THE REDS ARE THEY COULD BE BROUGHT 
INTO PLAY AT ANY TIME 
HE HAD A LONG HARD LOOK AT IT BUT 
WHAT WE'RE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS 
PLENTY OF BALLS STAY IN ON THESE 
TABLES 
THERE HAS BEEN TALK OF THE TABLES BOUNCY CUSHIONS WHICH MEANS THAT 
THE JAWS OF THE POCKET ARE ALSO IN 
A LITTLE BIT SHARP AND ANYTHING 
THAT IS NOT QUITE IN IS NOT GOING 
IN OFF 
THE ONLY CONSOLATION IS HE HAS MADE 
THINGS A LITTLE AWKWARD FOR NEAL 
HE IS GOING TO PLAY SOME KIND OF 
PLANT I'LL MY WORD HE MISSED THAT 
BY A MILE HE MISSED THAT BY SO 
MUCH IT IS UNTRUE L. L. WOULD HAVE 
BACKED HIM TO GET THAT PLANT MY 
WORD 
THAT IS WHY WE ARE BOTH SKINT WORD I WAS JUST ABOUT TO WAX LYRICAL 
ABOUT WHAT A GREAT SHOT IT WAS TO 
BRING THE PINK INTO PLAY IN THE 
PREVIOUS SHOT AND THEN HE PLAYS 
THAT 
IT COULD EASILY BE TWO TO ONE AND THE 
OTHER WAY THE FRAME IS GONE FOR ROBERTSON 
HE DECIDED NOT TO BOTHER PLAYING 
THE YELLOW BUT PLAY THE GREEN 
INSTEAD IT DID NOT MATTER 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE HAS PULLED INTO A 
THREE TO ZERO LEAD OVER ROBERT SON 
WE SAW 
JOHN HIGGINS TAKE A LEAD AGAINST 
RYAN DAY EARLIER TODAY 
THERE WAS A BIG CHANGE OF GUARD IN 
THAT MATCH ROBERTSON HAS BEEN 
GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE AGAINST 
MAGUIRE HE HAS BEEN IN THIS MATCH 
SO FAR BUT HIS THREE TO ZERO BEHIND HE 
NEEDS TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN 
HE IS LOOKING AT AT 
THE TOP 
SPIN SHOT 
WHICH IS 
TAKING HIM 
IN AND OUT OF 
WHICH IS TAKING HIM IN AND OUT OF BAULK 
HE HAS MISSED THE POT IT HAS GONE 
FROM BAD TO WORSE MISSING THE WAS ONE THING 
THE BLUE 
HAS CRASHED 
INTO THE REDS 
AND EVEN WORSE LOOK 
AT THE CUE 
BALL TRAVELLING LOOSE 
AND LOOK WHERE IT HAS FINISHED 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT THE BLACK FREE 
IN BOTH POCKETS L. WOULD BE VERY WORRIED IF I WAS A 
ROBERTSON FOUND 
AT THE MOMENT HE HAS NOT SETTLED 
OUT HERE IF I WAS A ROBERTSON 
FAN 
NO ONE VISIT FRAME WINNING CHANCE 
SO FAR 
THE KEY THING FOR ME IN THIS MATCH 
IS THAT 
ROBERTSON HAS 
NOT BEEN 
COMPETING AT THE SAFETY PLAY HE 
HAS ALWAYS LEFT MAGUIRE WITH EASY 
BALLS HIS SAFETY SUCCESS IS DOWN 
AT SEVENTY EIGHT PER CENT THE INTERESTING THING IS 
SO IS 
MAGUIRE'S IT IS NOT 
THAT HE 
HAS BEEN OUTPLAYED 
BUT 
BOTH 
PLAYING POOR 
SAFETY BUT 
MAGUIRE HAS 
BEEN MAKING MORE OF 
MAGUIRE HAS BEEN MAKING MORE OF THEM 
MAGUIRE JUST LOOKS MORE DANGEROUS 
IN AMONGST THE BALLS HIS POT 
SUCCESS NINETY ONE PER CENT ANYTHING OVER NINETY PER CENT 
IS OBVIOUSLY VERY DECENT ROBERTSON 
DOWN TO EIGHTY PER CENT WHICH TELLS A STORY 
REALLY OF HOW HE HAS PLAYED HE 
HAS MISSED NUMBER OF BALLS 
CERTAINLY RED AND A HIGH COLOUR 
WILL BE ENOUGH THE FACT THAT HE 
HAS TAKEN THE BLUE WOULD MEAN THAT 
POTENTIALLY NEIL 
ROBERTSON COULD 
POTENTIALLY NEIL ROBERTSON COULD TIE THE FRAME BUT THAT WOULD 
DEPEND IF 
THE BREAK ENDS AFTER THIS 
BLUE ROBERTSON MAY NOT COME TO THE 
TABLE 
MIND YOU HE HAS 
PLAYED THE 
MORE DIFFICULT 
RED THESE CAN BE 
MISSED IT IS FRAME BALL 
YES YOU 
SAW A LITTLE GRIM US ON HIS FACE 
AND THINKING THIS RED THE SCORE HE 
REALISED HIMSELF HE SHOULD HAVE 
PLAYED FOR 
THE RED BELOW THE PINK 
THAT IS BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED ON FIRE 
MAGUIRE THEY SAY BUT MISSED A 
COUPLE BUT FOUR TO ZERO IS THE BEST START 
POSSIBLE BUT NEIL ROBERTSON WILL 
BE VERY DISAPPOINTED COULD HAVE 
WON 
THREE OF 
THE FOUR 
HONEST WITH THE CHANCES HE HAS HAD PLAYED TO FLICK THE RED OUT 
JOE PERRY HOLES THE HIGHEST BREAK 
AT THE MOMENT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HOLDS 
THIS HAS ALL COME OFF NEIL 
ROBERTSON'S 
MISTAKE WHEN 
HE WAS 
PERFECT ON THE 
BLUE MISSED THE 
BLUE 
BY A LONG 
WAY CRASHED INTO 
THE REDS ONLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE AVAILABLE NOW 
HIS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY OF HIS CAREER 
HIS VERY SHORT CAREER THAT'S HOW 
GOOD THIS YOUNG 
MAN IS 
I'M SURE HE 
REALISES THE TARGET 
VERY WELL PLAYED STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
NEIL ROBERTSON WILL GO STRAIGHT TO 
THE PRACTICE TABLE HE HAS HAD 
PLENTY OF CHANCES HASN'T TAKEN ANY 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE HAS TAKEN THE MALL 
THEM ALL 
THINK THAT MAGUIRE HAS GOT SOME 
KIND OF SHOT FINN 
RED TO 
TO THE 
LEFT CENTRE 
AT WORST 
I THINK GETHIN RED A THIN RED TO THE LEFT CENTRE JUST OVERRAN IT WAS 
REALLY HARD 
TO 
HOLD FOR A COLOUR 
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS PINK WILL SPOT 
MICHAELA SAYS KNOW 
BUT HE IS SO DANGEROUS HE HAS NOT 
PLAYED HIS BRILLIANT BEST 
HAS HAD 
BREAKS OF FIFTY FIFTY SIX 
HAS HAD BREAKS OF FIFTY FIFTY SIX AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE ALREADY TODAY HE IS SHE 
WAS A 
POTENT FORCE 
BALLS IN HIS OPENING MATCH AGAINST 
ANTHONY HAMILTON 
HE LOOKS IN 
TOP TWO 
OR THREE 
PLAYERS IN THE 
WORLD AT THIS 
STAGE HE 
HAS LOOKED 
IT ALL SEASON 
NO NEED TO GO INTO THE CLUSTER OF 
SEVEN REDS 
HE MAY HAVE TO 
TO 
ACTUALLY CLINCH THE FRAME JUST 
GOING TO GET THE EXTENDED REST OUT 
HE PLAYED TO FINISH LOW ON THE 
BLACK THERE WILL STILL ON THE 
BLACK HE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO 
PLAY FOR THE RED ON THE BLUE NOW 
A CHOICE OF THREE REDS THAT IS THE 
IDEA IF IT IS WHAT YOU PLAY 
HE IT WAS A RED ON DO IT ALL'S OF 
THAT IS WHY HE WAS SHORT OF SPEED 
AND THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE IT WAS A BAD CONTACT THAT IS WHY 
HE IS SHORT OF SPEED 
AND THE 
WRONG 
SIDE OF THE BLUE 
THIS IS THE FIRST REAL TEST IN THIS 
BREAK IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT CUTTING 
THE BLACK IT IS THE ANGLE HE GOES 
AT IT 
WHEN A PLAYER OVER SCREWS IT BY 
ABOUT FAR HE IS SAYING I WOULD 
RATHER FINISH ON A BAULK COLOUR 
THEN FINISH SHORT OF THE BLUE THE 
HALF BALL GREEN AURA HALF BALL BLUE 
ALL HALF BALL BLUE 
THEY WERE PERFECT HE JUST NEEDED 
TO HIT THEM FULLER BUT THEY'RE 
STILL O. K. THAT LITTLE FLICK HELPED 
A THAT IS PERFECT LOOK PLAYERS WILL 
STILL THAT IS PERFECTLY 
THAT IS PERFECTLY PLAYED HE IS NOT 
A PLAYER MOVE CAN DELIVER HIS 
RHYTHM OH WHO CAN DO WITHOUT HIS 
RHYTHM HE IS A SERIOUS CONTENDER 
THIS YEAR NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT HE 
LOOKS GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN AS WELL 
YES HE LED JOHN HIGGINS IN THE 
SEMI FINAL LAST YEAR QUITE 
CONVINCINGLY HE ENDED UP LOSING 
THE GAME BY ABOUT THREE OR FOUR 
FRAMES I AM NOT SURE OF THE EXACT 
SCORELINE THE KEY THING IS HE 
SAID HE WAS NOT READY TO BE WORLD 
CHAMPION THIS YEAR L. THINK HE IS READY NOW 
HE LOST A FRAME IN UNLUCKY 
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE MATCH WITH 
JOHN HIGGINS 
HE BOUNCED BACK QUICKLY THIS SEASON 
FROM DISAPPOINTMENT 
HE WON THE U. K. CHAMPIONSHIP IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THE MANNER IN WHICH HE WON IN MADE 
ME THINK HE WAS DESTINED TO BE ONE 
OF THE GREATS OF THE GAME IT HAS 
TAKEN HIM A WHILE TO FULL FILL THAT 
REALLY HE HAD A FEW BAD RESULTS 
THE NEXT SEASON BUT HE LOOKS 
BIGGER THAN BETTER THAN EVER HE HE COULD BE A BIT DANGEROUS GIVEN 
THAT HE IS SIXTY THREE IN FRONT HE KNEW IT 
WAS FRAME BALL AND DECIDED TO PLAY 
A SHOT TO NOTHING ON THE BLUE THIS 
FRAME IS NOT DEAD YET AN AN INTERESTING CHOICE OF SHOT REALLY 
A LOT OF OTHER PLAYERS MIGHT THINK 
I HAVE PUT A COLOUR SAFE AND NONE 
WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM OVER THE LINE 
IN THE FRAME THE NOW THAT HE HAS 
NOT GOT IT ONE CHANCE COULD STILL 
GIVE NEAL ROBERTSON A HOPE 
I SPOKE TO ROBERTSON AT THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL AND HE'D JUST 
BOUGHT THOSE HE FORGOT HIS OTHER 
PAIR OF SHOES HE LEFT THEM IN 
CAMBRIDGE HE HAD TO BUY THERE'S 
BEFORE THE MATCH THEY'RE PROBABLY 
THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE PAIR OF 
SHOES HE HAS EVER WORN THAT IS NOT 
GREAT IS IT 
YOU COULD ARGUE IT HAS NOT BEEN HIS 
DAY THEN WHAT WITH THE SHOES AND 
THE SCORELINE AND THAT WILL STAYING 
OVER THE POCKET THIS IS FRAME BALL 
THAT BALL STAYING OVER THE POCKET 
WELL IF ROBERTSON'S FANS WERE NOT 
WORRIED THEY ARE GETTING WORRIED 
NOW IT IS KEY REALLY YOU HAVE 
GOT TO WIN AT LEAST FOUR FRAMES IN 
THIS MATCH IT IS UNLIKELY THAT YOU 
WOULD LOSE ALL THREE SESSIONS IN 
THEIR BEST OF TWENTY FIVE AT THIS STANDARD 
IT IS UNUSUAL BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE 
THE BEST YOU CAN OF THE LAST THREE 
FRAMES TWO FRAMES AT LEAST NEEDED 
SO THE MID SESSION COMES MAGUIRE 
IS STARTING TO PULL AWAY NOW HE IS 
FIVE TO ZERO UP OVER ROBERT SON ROBERT 
SON 
WELL AND EXCITED STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
GETS FRAME SIX UNDER WAY HE DID 
THIS AGAINST ANTHONY HAMILTON IN A 
PREVIOUS ROUND HE WENT EIGHT TO ZERO IN 
FRONT AND LOST THE LAST FRAME 
HE HAS NOT POTTED A BALL FOR OVER 
HALF AN HOUR L. THINK HE WILL POT 
ON HERE HE NEEDS A GOOD KISS 
ANYTHING BUT STRAIGHT IS O. K. 
STRAIGHT IS NO GOOD HAS HE GOT AN 
ANGLE TO GET BACK TO THE TOP 
THESE ARE THE KIND OF CHANCES THAT 
ROBERTSON HAS TO TAKE IF HE IS 
GOING TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF THIS 
SESSION HE IS GOING TO LOSE THE 
SESSION BUT BY HOW MANY HE PLAYED 
WITH LEFT HAND SIDE REVERSE SIDE 
IN THIS CASE HE LOOKS O. K. 
AMAZINGLY ENOUGH AT THIS IS 
ALREADY ROBERT AND'S HIGHEST BREAK 
OF THE MATCH SO FAR ROBERTSON'S 
HIGHEST BREAK THIS IS THE FIRST 
REAL CHANCE HE HAS OF WINNING THE 
FRAME IN ONE VISIT 
IT IS 
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE HE MISSED THAT L. 
DON'T KNOW IF HE TOOK HIS EYE OF 
THE SHOT FOR WHAT HAPPENED HE JUST 
OVER CUT IT IT WAS NEVER IN AT ANY 
STAGE 
YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE YOUR FOOT 
OFF THE GAS THE FACT THAT HE HIT 
IT IN THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE 
CUE BALL IS WHERE IT IS IT GOT 
LITTLE BIT MORE PACE IT WAS ON 
THIN SIDE PERHAPS IT WAS ON THE 
HE 
WAS FORTUNATE 
NOT 
TO LEAVE THIS RED 
THE FACT THAT 
THE WHITE HAD COME 
LOW MEANT THAT HE HAD HIT IT TOO 
THIN BUT HE DIDN'T THE FIRST EASY 
BALL HE HAS MISSED FOR QUITE 
SOMETIME 
THE SHOT STEPHEN MAGUIRE IS FACED 
WITH THERE IT IS HE DIDN'T 
REALLY WANT TO BREAK THIS PACK CUP 
HE MIGHT HAVE TO THIS PACK UP 
THAT'S NOT BAD THE REDS HAVEN'T 
SPREAD TOO MUCH THESE ARE THE 
KINDS OF POTS THAT NEIL ROBERTSON 
CAN KNOCK HIM WHEN HE IS RIGHT BUT 
HE HAS BEEN A LONG WAY SHORT OF HIS 
BEST TODAY CAN CAN KNOCK IN 
LET'S SEE HOW HE GETS ON THIS WILL 
TEST HIM 
I MUST ADMIT CAN'T QUITE EXPLAIN 
HOW BADLY HE HAS PLAYED HE LOOKED 
LIKE HE WAS COMING IN TO SOME FORM 
HE HAS NOT GOT ANYWHERE NEAR THAT 
ONCE AGAIN 
GET THAT TURNED OFF 
POLICE POLICE 
REALLY NEEDS TO GET A GOOD LENGTH 
OF CUE BALL HERE TO MAKE STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE WORK FOR HIS CHANCES AT 
THE MOMENT NEIL ROBERTSON IS 
GIFTING CHANCES TO STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
THERE IS ANOTHER GIFT BOUQUET 
LITTLE UNLUCKY TO PUSH IT TOWARDS 
THE CORNER O. K. A LITTLE UNLUCKY WELL THOUGHT OUT 
LOOK AT THE SHOT MAGUIRE HAS PLAYED 
HE HAS PLAYED THE KISS ONE ON TO 
THE OTHER AND HE 
HAS COME 
PERFECT 
ON TO 
THE 
BLACK AND 
THIS IS WHAT HE 
HAS GOT SO FAR KNOW IT IS ONLY 
FIFTEEN BUT THE OPENING SHOT DESERVE TO 
WIN ANY FRAME HE HAS THE 
BALLS AND 
SUCH POSITION WHERE WE COULD BE SEEING SIX TO ZERO IN SUCH A POSITION 
IT HAS NOT BEEN HIS DAY HE HAS NOT 
PLAYED WELL HE HAS MISSED ONE OR 
TWO POTS BY A LONG WAY HE ACTUALLY 
WAS A BIT ANGRY WHEN HE LOST THE 
FOURTH FRAME HE CRASHED HIS HAND ON 
THE WARM THE WAY OUT L. DON'T THINK 
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT FRUSTRATION WAS 
BEGINNING TO SHOW CRASHED HIS HAND ON THE WALL 
BUT HE CAN BE PRETTY RELENTLESS AS 
A PAIR STEPHEN MAGUIRE WHEN HE IS 
GIVEN ALL THE CHANCES AND HE HAS 
BEEN QUITE A GIVEN QUITE A FEW 
HE PLAYED THE CANNON AND HAS NEVER 
REALLY LOOKED LIKE MISSING SINCE RELENTLESS AS A PLAYER 
HE IS JUST CHECKING THE SCORES 
THERE IS A BIT MORE TO DO THERE 
ARE FOUR REDS LEFT THERE IS ONE ON 
AND TOO CLOSE TO THE SIDE CUSHIONS 
CAN BE GOT ON AS WELL AND TWO 
CLOSE TO THE SIDE CUSHIONS 
THE SHOT IS WELL WORTH A SECOND 
GLANCE HE REALLY HAD TO SCREW THAT 
HARD AND PLAY ONE RED ONTO THE 
OTHER THE WAY IT WORKED OUT THE 
BLACK WAS ON AT ALL TIMES 
OBVIOUSLY THE PINK COULD HAVE 
CRASHED INTO THE BLACK BUT HE WOULD 
NOT HAVE DESERVED THAT THAT WAS 
PRETTY CREATIVE 
SO WHAT WILL BE THE BLACK AND THE 
FURTHER RED NEEDED HE WILL BE 
PILING ON MORE AGONY TO NEIL 
ROBERTSON 
IT IS VERY VERY WORRYING TIMES NOW 
FOR NEIL ROBERTSON WE MENTIONED 
THAT HE HAD TO WIN AT LEAST TWO OF 
THE REMAINING THREE FRAMES OF THE 
AFTERNOON SESSION JUST TO GET NO 
WORSE THAN SIX TO DO YOU CAN GET 
BACK FROM THOSE DEFICITS BETTER 
THAN YOU CAN ANY OTHER SCORELINE 
THE OTHER THING IS THAT HIS 
OPPONENT DOESN'T NEED A SECOND 
INVITATION NEIL ROBERTSON IS FULLY 
AWARE OF THAT 
YES WHO WON THE 
FIRST EIGHT AGAINST HAMILTON IN 
ROUND ONE HE HAS NOW WON THE FIRST 
SIX HERE HE WON THE FIRST EIGHT 
SO HE IS A MAN IN FORM NOT MANY 
PLAYERS HAVE BROUGHT THEIR FIRST 
ROUND FORM INTO THE SECOND ROUND L. 
AM THINKING OF THE LIKES OF JOHN 
HIGGINS AND DING JUNHUI 
COULD THIS BE A SECOND CENTURY IN 
THIS AFTERNOON'S SESSION 
THAT WAS A LOVELY SHOT THERE IS 
NOT MUCH OF A CHANCE OF STEVE 
MAGUIRE'S FOURTH CENTURY OF THE 
TOURNAMENT 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX WAS THE CENTURY TOURNAMENT EARLIER ON IN THE MATCH WHEN HE 
MADE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THIS WOULD BE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN SHOULD 
HE GET IT 
THE BOY IS IN FORM STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
PILING EVEN MORE PRESSURE ON TO 
NEIL ROBERTSON 
THAT IS THE PROBLEM PLAYING AT 
POWER MAKES THE POCKETS THAT MUCH 
TIGHTER NEIL HIT IT PRETTY GOOD 
THIS ONE 
THE CUSHIONS ARE BOUNCING 
SLIGHTLY THE JAWS OF THE POCKETS 
ARE MADE OUT OF THE SEINE CUSHION 
ROBBERS THAT ABSOLUTELY RATTLED IN 
THE JAWS THE SAME CUSHION 
ROBBERS THE SAME RUBBER 
MAGUIRE LOOKS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY 
OF WINNING THE FRAME IN ONE VISIT 
EVERY TIME HE KNOWS THE BACK IS 
OUT OF PLAY STRAIGHT AWAY PINK 
INTO PLAY 
HE CAN'T GET ON TO A COLOUR FROM 
THAT ONE SO HE WILL PLAY THE ONE 
TO THE LEFT OF THE PINK 
WILL HE BE RELUCTANT TO TAKE THE 
PINK AGAIN IT DEPENDS WHETHER THE 
PINK SPOT IS COVERED HE DOESN'T 
REALLY WANT TO GET THE PINK UP ONTO 
THE BLUE SPOT 
IF HE IS ON THIS RED NICELY THAT 
ONE SHOT HAS GIVEN HIM THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SCORE HEAVILY THE 
PINK IS AVAILABLE IN AT LEAST THREE 
POCKETS 
A LITTLE SHAKE OF THE HEAD FROM THE 
CHOIR FROM STEPHEN MAGUIRE HE 
CAN'T QUITE GET TO THIS HE CAN 
ALWAYS FLICK A LITTLE SIDE ON THE 
SHOT HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HITTING 
THE BALL BADLY AT ALL SETTING HIS 
OWN STANDARD TODAY 
HE HAS THE 
CHOICE OF TWO REDS HE CAN PLAY FOR 
THE ONE RIGHT NEXT TO THE PINK AND 
THE ONE TO OF 
BOTH INTO THE SAME POCKET HE 
DOESN'T LIKE EITHER THE YELLOW IS 
JUST OFF ITS SPOT HE HAS A LITTLE 
MORE ROOM TO GET TO MACRO CUSHIONS 
FROM THE RED ON THE OUTSIDE TWO 
CUSHIONS THE FACT THE YELLOW WAS 
OFF ITS 
SPOT MADE 
THAT SHOT A LOT 
EASIER SO HE DIDN'T NECESSARILY 
PLAY FOR THE RIGHT HAND RED HE HAS 
PURPOSELY PLAYED DOWN TO THESE 
THREE OR FOUR HE CERTAINLY KNOWS 
HIS WAY AROUND DOESN'T HE 
EVERYTHING GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN 
PLAYED THAT LOVELY FLICKED TWO 
REDS OUT AND NICELY ON THE PINK 
YOU CAN SEE ANOTHER SIX REDS 
SIXPENCE WITHOUT A PROBLEM THAT 
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO WIN THE FRAME 
SIX REDS AND SIX PINKS 
I SUPPOSE THE OTHER FACTOR TO 
CONSIDER IN THIS MATCH IS THE HEAD 
TO HEAD RECORDS IT IS FIVE TO ZERO IN 
FAVOUR OF MAGUIRE NEIL ROBERTSON 
HAS NEVER BEATEN HIM BEFORE WHEN 
YOU SAY IT IS A DIFFERENT MATCH 
TODAY DOES PLAY A PART I FEEL 
WHEN SOMEONE HAS SUCH SUPREMACY 
IN THE PREVIOUS MATCHES HE WON THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP QUALIFIERS AND 
IT WAS SIX TO ZERO JOB ROBERTSON HAS 
JUST NEVER BEATEN HIM OR BEEN THAT 
CLOSE TO BEATING HIM REALLY HE IS 
GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN NO DOUBT ABOUT 
THAT 
YOU CAN SEE HIM JUST DOING A LITTLE 
MENTAL ARITHMETIC THERE TRYING TO 
WORK OUT HOW MANY REDS HE NEEDS 
WITHOUT BRINGING THE BLACK INTO 
PLAY 
I THINK THE ONLY RED HE CAN GET ON 
TO IS THE ONE REALLY OUT IN OPEN 
PLAY 
HE TOOK THE RISK AND IT WAS A RISK 
THAT MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN 
TO BE HONEST BUT HE FELT IT WAS 
FIFTY TO FIFTY WHETHER HE GOT NICELY COULD 
HAVE PLAYED FOR A LOOSE RED BUT 
DECIDED TO TAKE THE CHANCE HE HAS 
GOT A POT ON BUT MISSABLE 
HE MADE THEIR SHOT LOOK EASILY 
THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH 
THE CUEING BUT A SUPPOSE THE BEST 
PART ABOUT IT WAS THAT 
MIRACULOUSLY HE COULD GET HIS CUE 
TO THE CENTRE OF THE WHITE BALL 
THERE 
IT WAS ALMOST A BIT OF A JAB THERE HE JABBED AT IT DIDN'T GO THROUGH 
THE BALL AT ALL PLAYED IT 
PERFECTLY 
HE PROBABLY HAD TO JAB IT BECAUSE 
THE TWO REDS WERE THERE AND HE DID 
NOT WANT TO 
MAKE A 
MISTAKE 
TOUCH ONE OF THEM WITH HIS CUE 
GETTING ONTO THE BLUE PERFECTLY WAS 
THE HARD PART 
IT ALMOST LOOKED 
LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO 
GET THE 
CUE 
OUT OF 
THE WAY 
BEFORE HE HIT IT 
BUT IT 
IS PERFECT THE BARRAGE OF 
BREAKS HE IS GETTING NOW 
THIS IS BEGINNING TO LOOK VERY 
OMINOUS 
ONCE AGAIN THE FRAME IS LONG GONE 
IT IS JUST QUESTION OF HOW MANY 
HE MAKES HE HAS HAVE THE TWO 
CENTURIES IN THIS SESSION THREE 
OUT THE BREAKS OF FIFTY OR MORE BEFORE 
THIS ONE HE IS STARTING TO PEPPER 
HIM WITH BREAKS 
HE PURPOSELY 
PLAYED LOW ON THIS RED SO HE CAN 
FLICK THE RED INTO PLAY 
YES HE CAN PLAY THIS A LITTLE 
STUN RUN THROUGH A HALF BALL KISS 
ON THE BLACK HOPEFULLY HE WILL BE 
NICELY ON THE PINK THIS KISS COULD 
GO WRONG OF COURSE HE MIGHT NOT 
EVEN PLAY IT 
WELL A BREAK OF SEVENTY NINE NO CENTURY 
BUT I DON'T THEY HE WILL BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ONE BIT I 
DON'T THINK HE WILL BE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THAT ONE BIT 
WELL THAT IS JUST ABOUT 
UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST SHOT THAT 
ROBERTSON HAS HIT IN THIS GAME OF 
SNOOKER 
I SUPPOSE THERE COMES A TIME WHEN 
THE PRESSURE COMES OFF YOU A LITTLE 
BIT WHEN YOU'RE DOWN IT IS NEVER 
GOOD BUT YOU CANNOT GO ANYWHERE 
BUT UP IN THAT POSITION IT WAS LOVELY OPENING RED AS WE SAW 
THREE REDS THREE BLACKS HE WILL 
CERTAINLY BE ON THE BLACK AFTER 
THIS RED BUT THAT PACK IS NOT 
PRETTY NOW HE HAS GOT TO BE VERY 
CAREFUL IF HE SCREWS OFF HE COULD 
END UP ON THE BACK CUSHION BECAUSE 
THEY WILL SPRING OFF MORE THAN ONE 
RED 
HE HAS DONE WELL THERE BAR FOR THE 
KISS ON THAT RED BY THE CUSHION HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A GOOD POSITION 
HE HAS BEEN CURSED THE CUE BALL 
FLICKED THE OTHER RED YOU WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ON 
SOMETHING HE HAS HAD NOTHING EASY 
AND WHEN YOU ARE SEVEN ZERO BEHIND 
YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE PLAIN THESE 
SHOTS SEVEN TO ZERO YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE 
PLAYING THESE SHOT 
HE HAS GOT A THIN RED THERE HE 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO SCREW CROSS TO THE 
BLACK HE MIGHT BE CONSIDERING THAT 
WHATEVER HE PLAYS IT IS NOT EASY 
HE IS TAKING THIS RED ON HE IS 
TRYING TO AVOID THE PINK STAY ON 
THE BLACK I THINK 
WITH IT BEING 
THAT THIN CAN HE GET ENOUGH 
PURCHASE ON THE CUE BALL TO MISS 
THE PINK HE JUST FLICKED THE PINK 
DIDN'T HE THAT HAS PROBABLY TAKEN 
A LITTLE BIT OF PACE OUT OF THE CUE 
BALL ONCE AGAIN HE JUST CANNOT 
GET ANYTHING TO HAPPEN THAT WAS 
NEARLY A GREAT SHOT 
YES A BIT 
CLOSE TO THE CUSHION AGAIN EVEN 
WHEN HE POTS THIS BLACK THE NEXT 
RED IS NOT STRAIGHT FORWARD THAT 
WILL DRIVE HIM UP THE WALL MISSING 
THAT 
HOW MANY TIMES HAS HE HIT THAT THAT FAR JAW TODAY L. CAN THINK OF 
AT LEAST THREE BALLS HE HAS MISSED 
INTO THAT POCKET EVERY TIME INTO 
THAT FAR JAW THAT WAS A TOUGH OPENER 
HE COULD JUST CLEAR ONE CUSHION IF 
YOU WANT TO OPEN THEM UP IF HE 
WANTS TO OPEN THEM UP NOT BAD IT 
WAS NOT THE BEST OF SHOTS ACTUALLY 
LOOK AT THAT THAT IS A REFLECTION 
OF HOW MAGUIRE IS PLAYING NINETY FOUR PER CENT POT 
SUCCESS RATE FOR MAGUIRE IT TELLS 
YOU HOW WELL YOU'RE PLAYING 
YES ROBERTSON IS AT EIGHTY PER CENT WHICH 
MEANS THAT ONE IN EVERY FIVE 
CHANCES IS LEAVING STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
RIGHT IN THE BALLS AND HE IS 
SCORING SO HEAVILY AND IT IS NOT 
BEYOND THE REALMS OF POSSIBILITY 
THAT HE COULD WIN THE FRAME FROM 
HERE COULD THIS BE THE NIGHTMARE 
OF ALL SESSIONS 
I THINK HE PLAYED FRY IN BEHIND IT 
ACTUALLY IF HE GETS THIS IT WILL 
BE A BLESSING IN DISGUISE HE 
PLAYED IT BEHIND IT ACTUALLY 
THOSE FOUR REDS HE WOULD LIKE TO 
SHIFT BUT I WONDER IF HE HAS 
ENOUGH ANGLE ON THIS HE HAS 
SOMETHING TO PLAY WITH THERE IT IS 
I THINK HE WILL SETTLE FOR THAT 
REALLY YOU WOULD NOT BET AGAINST 
HIM POTTING THAT RED INTO THE TOP 
POCKET 
I LOVE THE WAY HE PLAYED IT POCKET HE STUNNED INTO THEM WHICH IS WHAT 
YOU HAVE TO DO WITH THOSE REDS 
OTHER WORDS HE WOULD HAVE SCREWED 
BACK OFF THEM THIS IS BIG EVERY 
CHANCE 
HE PLAYED THAT SHOT BUT JUST A BIT 
OF RIGHT HAND SIDE WITH JUST A 
BIT 
STILL A BIT OF WORK TO DO A MEAN 
THE RED UP THE TABLE THAT IS QUITE 
POTTABLE TO THE RIGHT CENTRE I 
MEAN IF THAT THE ACUTE ANGLE THAT 
IS ANOTHER BREAK OVER IT FIFTY 
THAT IS THE SEVENTH BREAK OF FIFTY OR MORE 
IN THIS MATCH IT TELLS YOU THE 
KIND OF SNOOKER HE IS PLAYING 
INCLUDING THE CENTURIES ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE HUNDRED TEN 
A PRETTY RUTHLESS DISPLAY 
YES HE 
COULD WIN THE FRAME THE TWO REDS 
AND EITHER PINK'S OR BLACKS WITH 
TWO REDS L. DON'T SEE HOW HE CAN 
GET ON TO AN ANGLE FOR THE RED AND 
THE BLACK 
AND HE PUT CAN HE GET DOWN ON THE 
BLACK IS IT TOO STRAIGHT 
THERE MAY BE ONE LAST GLIMMER OF 
HOPE FOR ROBERTSON THIS WILL PUT 
HIM THIRTY FOUR IN FRONT WHEN YOU TRY AND 
SCREW BEHIND IT OR WILL HE LEAVE 
THE DOUBLE COMING ROUND TO SEE IF 
HE FANCIES THE DOUBLE HE WILL ONLY 
PLAY THAT DOUBLE CUE BALL INTO 
BLACK HE WILL NOT BE LEAVING THE 
WHITE IN THE OPEN PLAY 
HE DECIDED TO MOVE IT OUT KNOWING 
THAT THE DOUBLE WAS THERE IF HE 
DIDN'T THIS FORTY EIGHT TO ZERO THIS IS FOR 
EIGHT ZERO 
A GREAT BREAK OF SIXTY SEVEN STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE THIRTEEN HIMSELF HIGH STANDARDS 
HE WAS PRETTY FRUSTRATED AFTER 
MISSING THIS MEAN WHAT CAN YOU 
DO HE MISSED A DOUBLE THAT IS 
ABOUT ALL HE MISSED IN THIS MATCH 
COME ON STEPHEN THE GAME IS NOT 
THAT EASY 
YES IT IS KEY FOR HIM TO KEEP THE 
RED AT THIS END OF THE TABLE SO HE 
HAS A CHANCE OF 
GETTING THE 
RED AND 
THE BLACK 
HE MAY TAKE A CUT ON 
HERE BECAUSE 
HE COULD 
CANNON ON 
TO 
THE 
BLACK AND 
KNOCK IT SAFE 
IS A BIT OF ADVANTAGE IN PLAYING 
THIS IS IT WORTH TAKING IT ON HE 
THOUGHT HE WOULD GO FOR THE CLIP 
HE THOUGHT HE HAD EVERY CHANCE OF 
KNOCKING THE BLACKS SAFE POLICE 
SAY HE HAS NOT SNOOKERED BID OH 
NO BLACKS SAFE PLEASE SAY HE 
HAS NOT SNOOKERED IT HE NEEDS A RESULT HERE 
THIS IS GREAT ISN'T IT WHEN YOU 
ARE IN FORM THIS GAME IS LOVELY 
THAT IS ALL YOU NEED UNBELIEVABLE 
HAVE THE RUN OF THE BALLS IS HAVE 
THE RUN OF THE BALLS ARE IN THIS 
GAME 
WELL THIS HAS BEEN RELENTLESS SEVEN 
BREAKS OVER FIFTY INCLUDING TWO 
CENTURIES A MATCH FOR ANYONE THE 
WAY HE HAS PLAYED TODAY ROBERTSON 
IN THE EARLY PART OF THE MATCH WHEN 
HE WAS FOUR TO ZERO BEHIND COULD HAVE WON 
THREE OF THE FIRST FOUR SINCE THEN 
HE HAS NOT HAD MANY CHANCES TO BE 
PERFECTLY HONEST NOT MANY SESSIONS 
HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE HAVE ENDED 
EIGHT ZERO HE WON THE FIRST EIGHT 
AGAINST ANTHONY HAMILTON HE HAS 
WON THE FIRST EIGHT AGAINST NEAL 
ROBERTSON HERE IS THE MAN IN FORM 
WITHOUT DOUBT 
HE PLAYED VERY VERY WELL HE WOULD 
HAVE WON THE SESSION 
HE HAS TAKEN ALL EIGHT OF THE 
AFTERNOON SESSION NEAL ROBERTSON 
IS GOING TO HAVE TO WIN THIRTEEN BEFORE 
HE WINS FIVE MAGUIRE WINS EIGHT ZERO 
WELL THAT WAS BIT OF SURPRISE 
IT WAS A WHITEWASH HERE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE NEAL HAD BETTER GET HIS 
HEAD TOGETHER AND HIS ACT TOGETHER 
IF HE WANTS TO RESCUE HIS CRUCIBLE 
CAMPAIGN THIS YEAR HE IS BACK ON 
THE TABLE TONIGHT WHEN THE SESSION 
RESUMES AGAIN STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
WE ARE BACK LATER GOOD NIGHT
