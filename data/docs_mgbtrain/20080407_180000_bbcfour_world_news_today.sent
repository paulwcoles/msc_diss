PRINCESS DIANA AND DODI FAYED 
PROTESTS HAVE CAUSED SECURITY

SEARCH OF JUSTICE THE FAMILY SUING 
THE MEN THEY BLAME FOR THE SINGLE 
MOST LETHAL BUT BOMBING OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND'S TROUBLES WE 
HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE REPORT FROM 
INSIDE WAR RAVAGED SOMALIA ON THE 
BATTLE TO CONTROL THE CAPITAL 
MOGADISHU AND REMEMBERING A 
MAESTRO WHO HELPED BRING CLASSICAL 
MUSIC TO THE MASSES IT'S ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
SINCE HERBERT VON AT MARRIOTT WAS 
BORN HERBERT VON KARAJAN 
PRINCESS DIANA AND DODI FAYED WERE 
UNLAWFULLY KILLED THROUGH THE GROSS 
NEGLIGENCE OF THEIR DRIVER AND THE 
PURSUING PAPARAZZI A JURY IN 
LONDON RETURNED ITS VERDICT TODAY 
AFTER A SIX MONTH HEARING WHICH 
TOOK EVIDENCE FROM HUNDREDS OF 
PEOPLE THIS WAS THE MOST SERIOUS 
VERDICT AVAILABLE TO THEM THEY 
CONCLUDED THAT PHOTOGRAPHERS AND 
THEIR DRIVERS WERE RECKLESSLY DRAKE 
RAISING THE COUPLE'S MERCEDES 
THAT CAR WAS BEING DRIVEN 
RECKLESSLY BY IT ON REPORT WHILE 
THREE TIMES OVER THE FRENCH DRINK 
DRIVE LIMIT ON REPORT THE BIRD 
IS A CLEAR REJECTION OF THE 
CONSPIRACY THEORIES PROMOTED BY 
MOHAMED AL FAYED FINALLY WE HAVE 
A VERDICT DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES 
WHO IN LIFE WAS THE FOCUS OF 
INTERNATIONAL FASCINATION AND WHO 
IN DEATH HAS BEEN AT THE CENTRE OF 
SO MUCH SPECULATION ABOUT AN 
ALLEGED MURDER CONSPIRACY SHE WAS 
UNLAWFULLY KILLED BY THE 
RECKLESSNESS OF HER DRIVER HENRI 
PAUL AND THE PACK OF PHOTOGRAPHERS 
WHO WERE PURSUING HER TRYING TO 
GET A PICTURE THE JURY OF ELEVEN 
RANDOMLY SELECTED MEMBERS OF THE 
PUBLIC WHO LAST OCTOBER WERE TAKEN 
TO PARIS TO SEE THE KEY LOCATIONS 
FOR THEMSELVES AND TWO OVER THE 
PAST SIX MONTHS HAVE HEARD EVIDENCE 
FROM MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WITNESSES HAD 
SPENT THIRTY FIVE DAYS CONSIDERING THEIR 
VERDICTS JUST BEFORE FOUR THIRTY P. M. THE 
JURY FOREMAN GOT TO HER FEET IN A 
COURTROOM PACKED WITH LAWYERS AND 
WITH MOHAMED AL FAYED AND DIANA'S 
SISTER LADY SARAH MCCORQUODALE 
BOTH WATCHING THE VERDICT SHE 
SAID WERE OF UNLAWFUL KILLING 
WITH THE FOLLOWING CAUSE OF THE 
CRASH THE SPEED AND DRIVING OF THE 
MERCEDES THE SPEED AND DRIVING OF 
THE FOLLOWING VEHICLES AND THE 
IMPAIRMENT OF HENRI PAUL IT IS THE 
ROLE OF HENRI PAUL WHICH IN MANY 
WAYS HAS BEEN AT THE CENTRE OF THE 
INQUEST AND WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED 
BY THE VERDICT OF UNLAWFUL KILLING 
THE JURY HEARD EVIDENCE ABOUT HIS 
CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL ON THE 
EVENING OF THE CRASH HE HAD THE 
EQUIVALENT OF FOUR SINGLE WHISKIES 
IN THE HOTEL BAR ON A POOR DRAW 
THE MERCEDES AT EXCESSIVE SPEED 
PURSUED BY A GROUP OF PHOTOGRAPHERS 
NONE OF THEM WOULD TESTIFY BUT THE 
JURY HAS DECIDED THAT THEIR PURSUIT 
OF THE MERCEDES WAS SO GROSSLY 
NEGLIGENT AS TO DESERVE THE FINDING 
OF UNLAWFUL KILLING OUTSIDE THE 
COURT THE FORMER COMMISSIONER OF 
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE LORD 
STEVENS WHO LED THE THREE YEAR 
LONG BRITISH INQUIRY INTO THE CRASH 
GAVE HIS REACTION TO THE VERDICTS 
I JUST HOPE THAT IS CAN BE 
ENCLOSURE TO WHAT HAS BEEN A 
TRAUMATIC EVENT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
BRING CLOSURE MR. AL FAYED HAS 
SAID HE WILL ACCEPT THE VERDICT OF 
THE JURY THE VERDICT HAS BEEN 
CLEAR THEY HAVE SAID THEY ARE 
ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT THERE IS NO 
CONSPIRACY IN RELATION TO THIS 
MATTER 
MOHAMED AL FAYED'S CENTRAL MATTER ALLEGATION WAS THAT THE SECRET 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE M. I SIX HAD 
MURDERED THE COUPLE THE CORONER 
RULED THAT THERE WASN'T A SHRED OF 
EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE CLAIM 
AND THAT IT WAS THE DUKE OF 
EDINBURGH WHO HAD MASTERMINDED THE 
MURDER OF HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ONE 
SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL SAID 
THE AL FAYED ALLEGATIONS WERE 
TOTALLY ABSURD 
THE CENTRAL 
ALLEGATION THAT PRINCE PHILIP 
CONSPIRED WITH M. I SIX TO MURDER THE 
PRINCESS WAS PREPOSTEROUS IT WAS 
ALWAYS PREPOSTEROUS 
THOSE WHO WERE 
CLOSE TO DIANA HOPE THAT MOHAMED 
AL FAYED WILL FINALLY LET MATTERS 
REST 
I HOPE NOW THAT HE WILL FIND REST SOME SORT OF PEACE AND STOP 
PURSUING THIS LINE OF INQUIRY THIS 
WHOLE CIRCUS THAT HE'S REALLY 
KEPT ON THE ROAD SINGLE HANDEDLY 
FOR TEN YEARS I THINK HE NEEDS TO 
ALLOW DIANA AND HIS SON SOME 
DIGNITY NOW IN THEIR DEATH AND LET 
THEM REST 
HOWEVER TONIGHT MR. AL 
FAYED'A SPOKESWOMAN HAS RETURNED TO 
HIS CLAIM THAT IT WAS MURDER 
A I'M 
NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO SAYS THEY 
WERE MURDERED DIANA PREDICTED THAT 
SHE WOULD BE MURDERED AND HOW IT 
WOULD HAPPEN SO I AM DISAPPOINTED 
THE VERDICTS WILL COME AS A BLOW TO 
THE MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND 
THE WORLD WHO HAVE SUPPORTED MY 
STRUGGLE AND I THANK THEM 
MR. AL 
FAYED LEFT THE HIGH COURT WITHOUT 
SAYING ANYTHING WHETHER HE WILL 
NOW DO AS HE SAID HE WOULD ON OATH 
IN THE WITNESS BOX AND ACCEPT THESE 
VERDICTS REMAINS TO BE SEEN 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
DAY'S OTHER INTERNATIONAL NEWS 
NINE ISLAMIC MILITANTS HAVE ESCAPED 
FROM A PRISON IN THE NORTHERN 
MOROCCAN TOWN MOST OF THE NINE 
WERE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES FOR 
THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN SUICIDE 
BOMBINGS IN CASABLANCA IN MAY TWO THOUSAND THREE 
FORTY FIVE PEOPLE DIED THERE MOROCCO'S 
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE HAS SAID ALL 
MEASURES ARE BEING TAKEN TO FIND 
THE ESCAPEES IRAQ'S PRIME MINISTER 
NOURI AL MALIKI HAS THREATENED TO 
EXCLUDE THE SHI'ITE CLERIC MOQTADA 
AL SADR FROM THE POLITICAL PROCESS 
HE SAID THAT UNLESS MUQTADA AL SADR 
DISBANDS HIS MILITIA THE MEHDI 
ARMY HIS MOVE AND WILL BE BARRED 
FROM TAKING PART IN ELECTIONS IT'S 
BEEN DEPARTED THAT MOQTADA AL SADR 
IS SEEKING RELIGIOUS GUIDANCE ON 
WHAT THE RUN UP TO DISBAND THE ARMY 
ZIMBABWE'S HIGH COURT HAS POSTPONED 
FOR AT LEAST TODAY A RULING ON 
WHETHER TO ORDER THE IMMEDIATE 
RELEASE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION RESULTS IT'S NINE DAYS 
SINCE THE ELECTION PRESIDENT 
MUGABE OF AUSTRIA'S GOVERNING PARTY 
ZANU P. F. ONCE A DELAY BY THE BOATS 
ARE RECOUNTED THE OPPOSITION HAS 
DELIVERED A PETITION TO THE COURT 
DEMANDING THE RESULTS BE MADE 
AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY THEY ACCUSE 
MUGABE OF DELIBERATELY STALLING THE 
PROCESS DOUBLE IN ATHENS THEN 
LONDON AT NOW PARIS AND STILL 
EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES TO GO TROUBLE THE 
RELAY BID FOR THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
BATTLING ITS WAY THROUGH PROTEST AT 
ALMOST EVERY STEP MUST BE ENOUGH TO 
DEPRESS EVEN THE MOST DOG EARED 
CHINESE SECRET SERVICE AGENT IT 
HAS JUST FINISHED ITS JOURNEY 
THROUGH THE FRENCH CAPITAL AND 
JUST AS THE WORD THE FLAME HAD TO 
BE EXTINGUISHED OF FOUR TIMES PUT 
ON A BUS TOUR PROTECTED AND THE 
FINAL CEREMONY WAS DROWNED OUT BY 
BOOING ALL THIS DESPITE THE 
EFFORTS OF THREE THOUSAND POLICE CAN THE 
RELAY REALLY GO ON FROM HERE THIS 
WASN'T HOW IT WAS MEN TO BE 
BLOODIED PROTECT DEMONSTRATORS ON 
THE STREETS OF PARIS DURING WHAT 
WAS BILLED AS A CELEBRATION OF THE 
OLYMPIC SPIRIT IT'S NOW BECOME THE 
FOCUS OF PROTESTS A MASSIVE POLICE 
OPERATION THREE THOUSAND OFFICERS FAILED TO 
STOP THE TORCH RELAY DESCENDING 
INTO FARCE BARELY VISIBLE AT THE 
BEST OF TIMES BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY 
SECURITY ON THREE OCCASIONS THE 
TORCH DISAPPEAR ENTIRELY ARNOLD ON 
BOARD A BUS TO AVOID THE 
DEMONSTRATORS BUNDLED THIS IS 
EXACTLY WHAT THE ORGANISERS OF THIS 
TORCH RELAY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE 
TODAY NOISY PROTESTERS ON THE 
STREETS OF PARIS GIVING THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH A HOSTILE RECEPTION 
AND AT THE OFFICIAL DEMONSTRATION 
WELL AWAY FROM THE RELAY BUT IT 
WAS TIBET NOT THE OLYMPICS THAT 
PEOPLE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS THIS IS NOT ABOUT BEING AGAINST THE 
GAINS THIS IS ABOUT USING THE 
OCCASION FOR PEOPLE IN THE WORLD 
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON SO THEY CAN 
NOT PARTICIPATE IT'S THE ONLY WAY 
TO HAVE ACCESS TO POLITICIANS THE THE CHINESE ORGANISERS HAD THEIR 
SUPPORTERS ON THE STREET AS WELL 
THESE STUDENTS ENTHUSIASTIC BACKERS 
OF THE ASIAN GAMES BUT AFTER THE 
LONDON PROTESTS WHEN A BLUE SUITED 
CHINESE SECURITY MARSHALL FAILED TO 
STOP THE WOULD BEING DISRUPTED 
OLYMPIC OFFICIALS ARE WORRIED WHERE 
THIS WILL END 
WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT 
HAPPY WITH THE PROTESTS WE RESPECT 
THE PROTESTS THERE'S NO DOUBT 
ABOUT THAT AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT 
VIOLENT 
IN THE END THE PARIS VIOLENT TORCH RELAY WAS ABANDONED BUT 
THERE ARE MORE THAN TWENTY CITIES STILL 
TO BE VISITED AND FURTHER PROTESTS 
ARE BOUND TO FOLLOW IT HAS TO BE 
SAID PROTESTS AND BOYCOTTS ARE 
ALMOST ANOTHER CATEGORY OF OLYMPIC 
SPORT IT'S RARE FOR THE GAMES TO 
PASS WITHOUT CONTROVERSY BARCELONA 
PAST BEST INCIDENT FREE EVENT IN 
NINETEEN NINETY TWO OF THE FIRST IN DECADES 
BEFORE THE OPENING CEREMONY FOR THE 
MEXICO CITY GAMES IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT STUDENTS 
WERE FIRED ON BY THE MEXICAN ARMY 
AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED DIED AT MUNICH IN 
NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO GUNMEN FROM THE PALESTINIAN 
GROUP BLACK SEPTEMBER MURDERED ELEVEN 
ISRAELI ATHLETES IN THEIR COMPOUND 
NINETEEN EIGHTY SAW THE BIGGEST BOYCOTT WHEN 
IT SIXTY TWO COUNTRIES STAYED AWAY FROM 
MOSCOW IN RESPONSE TO THE SOVIET 
INTERVENTION AFGHANISTAN IN 
RETALIATION THE SOVIET UNION LED 
AN EASTERN BLOC BOYCOTT OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
LOS ANGELES GAMES SO WHEN CHINA 
SEIZED ITS CHANCE TO SHOW OF THE 
NATION ADVANCING INTO THE MODERN 
WORLD IT ALSO GAVE PROTESTERS AN 
OPEN GOAL AND A TILT TO THE TIME 
HONOURED TRADITION WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN NEXT IN THIS OLYMPIC EVENT 
AT OUR BIRMINGHAM STUDIO IS THE 
SPORTS JOURNALIST DUNCAN MACKAY 
WHO CARRIED THE TORCH FOR PART OF 
ITS JOURNEY IN LONDON YESTERDAY HE 
IS CO EDITOR OF CHINA GOLD 
I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT YOU ARE 
PERSONALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH 
CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD HOW DO 
YOU SQUARE THAT WITH CARRYING THE 
TORCH 
I'VE ALWAYS MADE IT CLEAR TORCH THAT I'M APPALLED BY WHAT'S 
HAPPENING IN TIBET AND CHINA AS 
GENERAL RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS I 
DON'T SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT BUT I 
THINK THE TORCH IS MORE THAN JUST 
ABOUT BEIJING I THINK IT'S ABOUT 
THE OLYMPICS AND WHAT IT STANDS FOR 
THE TORCH WAS PART OF THE OLYMPICS 
BEFORE BEIJING WERE AWARDED THE 
GAMES IT WILL BE PART OF THE 
OLYMPICS AFTER BEIJING HAVE HOSTED 
THE GAMES I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE 
BRINGING TOGETHER OF NATIONS TWO HUNDRED FIVE 
COUNTRIES WILL GATHER IN BEIJING 
THERE'S NO OTHER EVENT IN THE WORLD 
DOES THAT SORT OF THING THAT'S HOW 
I SWEAR IT 
WHEN YOU ARE CARRYING 
THAT TORTURE AND YOU HAVE A PHALANX 
OF CHINESE SECRET SERVICEMEN AROUND 
YOU AND YOU SEE PROTESTERS BEING 
PRETTY ROUGHLY HANDLED SOME OF 
THEM TODAY BEATEN TO THE GROUND 
THAT'S O. K. 
NO IT'S NOT WHEN I 
AGREED TO CARRY THE TORCH I HAD 
NEVER ENVISAGED I'D BE RUNNING 
THROUGH WHITECHAPEL AS I DID 
YESTERDAY I WAS WITH TWELVE BLUE AND 
WHITE TRACK SUITED SECURITY GUARDS 
FROM BEIJING AND PROBABLY ANOTHER 
DOZEN YELLOW COATED MEMBERS OF THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE I WAS BEING 
SHOUTED AT THAT'S NOT WHAT I 
SIGNED UP FOR AND IT'S NOT HOW I 
IMAGINED IT TO BE 
I KNOW TOO 
THAT HE'S BEEN A DECADE INVOLVED IN 
THE OLYMPICS OF SERVING IT AND 
REPORTING ON PRETTY MUCH WHAT GOES 
ON THERE IT STILL FEELS LIKE AN 
IDEA WORTH DEFENDING 
IT DOES 
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THE CHANGE 
IS NOT AS FAST AS EVERYONE WOULD 
LIKE IN CHINA BUT I THINK THE 
OLYMPICS HIS SHINING A LIGHT ON 
THEM THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SHONE 
ON THEM OTHERWISE WOULD I HAVE 
BEEN A NEW PROGRAMME TO BE TALKING 
ABOUT TIBET IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR 
THE OLYMPICS AND THE TORCH RELAY 
OF COURSE I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE 
FREE TIBET MOVEMENT HAVING 
UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO 
FURTHER THEIR CAUSE I DON'T FOR 
ONE MINUTE PLANE WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
I FULLY SUPPORT WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY IS THERE TO 
BE TAKEN AND THEY'VE DONE THAT I 
THINK THE OLYMPICS HIS ILLUMINATING 
A LIGHT ON CHINA THAT WOULDN'T BE 
OTHERWISE 
SOME ATHLETES AND SOME OTHERWISE PEOPLE IN YOUR POSITION ARE 
SUGGESTING THERE IS A SEPARATION 
BETWEEN POLITICS AND SPORT IF THE 
POLITICIANS WANT PERHAPS TO TAKE 
ACTION TO BOYCOTT THE OPENING OR 
THE CLOSING CEREMONIES AND THAT 
MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT MATTER WHAT 
YOU MAKE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S 
SUGGESTION THE OPENING CEREMONY 
SHOULD NOW BE BOYCOTTED AS A MARK ONE 
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE 
TODAY IN BRITAIN HIGH STREET BANKS 
HAVE BRANCHES IN CHINA PEOPLE PEOPLE ORANGE SHOPS BUYING GOODS 
MANUFACTURED IN CHINA SURELY IF 
PEOPLE WERE OUT PICKETING THOSE 
PLACES AS WELL AN ECONOMIC BOYCOTT 
WOULD HAVE FAR MORE EFFECT THAN A 
FEW POLITICIANS BOYCOTTING THE 
OPENING CEREMONY WHICH WILL ONLY 
LAST FOR FIVE HOURS ANYWAY THE THE LATEST UPSURGE IN THE FIGHT FOR 
CONTROL OF THE SOMALI CAPITAL 
MOGADISHU HAS BEEN LARGELY HIDDEN 
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD THIS IS 
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SO DANGEROUS 
FOR JOURNALISTS TO OPERATE THERE 
THOUSANDS OF TROOPS FROM 
NEIGHBOURING ETHIOPIA HAVE 
INTERVENED AND ARE ON THE SIDE OF 
THE SOMALI GOVERNMENT TO EXPEL AN 
ARMED ISLAMIST GROUP WHICH BRIEFLY 
HELD CONTROL AT A WORLD AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT HAS NOW MANAGED TO 
REACH MOGADISHU FLYING INTO 
MOGADISHU WITH THE UNITED NATIONS 
AID OFFICIALS IS ONE OF THE VERY 
FEW RELATIVELY SAFE WAYS TO GET 
THERE THE AIRPORT HAS COME UNDER 
ATTACK IN THE PAST AND VISITORS 
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE ANY CHANCES 
HOW WERE YOU WELCOME 
THE UN HAS 
ITS OWN ARMED GUARDS AID WORKERS 
MAY NOT BE A DIRECT POLITICAL 
TARGET BUT THE DANGER OF GETTING 
CAUGHT UP IN THE CROSSFIRE OR BEING 
ATTACKED BY CRIMINALS AND A PLACE 
WHERE LAW AND ORDER HAS BROKEN DOWN 
IS ALWAYS PRESENT THE PRESIDENTIAL 
COMPOUND IS PROTECTED BY A MIXTURE 
OF SOMALI TROOPS SEEN HERE AND SO 
DOES FROM NEIGHBOURING ETHIOPIA 
THE ETHIOPIANS BACKED BY THE 
UNITED STATES WERE CRUCIAL IN THE 
CAMPAIGN TO EXPEL THE EARLIER 
ISLAMIST ADMINISTRATION IN 
MOGADISHU THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
GOVERNMENT ARE RECOGNISED BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS 
SOMALIA'S LAST BEST HOPE AND THE 
UNITED NATIONS IS ENCOURAGING 
RECONCILIATION TALKS BETWEEN THE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED OPPOSITION 
EVERYONE WILL AGREE THAT WHAT WE 
NEED TO END THIS IS DIALOGUE WHILE 
WE HAVE TO DELIVER THE ASSISTANCE 
NOW IT IS DIALOGUE AND 
RECONCILIATION THAT REPLACE OUR 
HOPES FOR THE LONG TERM 
THERE ISN'T MUCH HOPE HERE ON 
PATROL WITH PEACEKEEPERS FROM THE 
AFRICAN UNION MISSION WE SAW THE 
PHYSICAL DAMAGE EVEN MORE SHOCK 
ANYTHING A WAY WAS THE EMPTINESS 
CIVIL WAR HAS BEEN TEARING 
MOGADISHU APART FOR DECADES THE 
RECENT FIGHTING HAS CARED FOR 
PEOPLE INTO FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES 
THAN EVER BEFORE THE HANDFUL OF 
PEACEKEEPERS SAY THEY NEED HELP 
VERY MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE FENCE 
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE IF YOUR 
NEIGHBOUR'S HOUSE IS ON FIRE YOU 
DON'T WAIT TO SEE IF THE OTHER 
NEIGHBOURS ARE COMING TO PUT OUT 
THE FIRE YOU MOVE IN AND THROW ON 
A BUCKET OF WATER THAT IS WHAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD BE 
DOING 
A YEAR AGO THESE STREETS DOING WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BUSIER THE 
LATEST FLARE IN FIGHTING HAS CAUSED 
AROUND A HALF OF THE POPULATION OF 
THE CAPITAL TO FLEE AN ESTIMATED 
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE MADE REFUGEES 
IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY THE SOLUTION 
IS POLITICAL RECONCILIATION W. YEARS 
OF MISTRUST BETWEEN SOMALI KLANS 
AND THE FACT FOREIGN FORCES ARE 
BECOMING INVOLVED THAT 
RECONCILIATION WILL BE EXTREMELY 
DIFFICULT TO SAY THE LEAST THE 
WEAKEST AND POOREST CAN'T EVEN FLEE 
THEY'RE TRAPPED IN THE CITY HASSAN 
ABDI ELMI SAID PEACE COULD BE 
ACHIEVED THROUGH RECONCILIATION 
TALKS OR PEACE COULD COME ABOUT IF 
THE ETHIOPIAN WAS DREW OR HE SAID 
INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPERS COULD 
COME TO HELP IF NONE OF THOSE 
THINGS HAPPENS ANOTHER GENERATION 
OF SOMALIS COULD BE CONDEMNED TO A 
LIFE OF CONFLICT 
THE OMAGH BOMBINGS IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND KILLED TWENTY NINE PEOPLE AMONG 
THEM A WOMAN PREGNANT WITH TWINS 
THAT WAS A DECADE AGO TODAY THEIR 
FAMILIES BEGAN A CIVIL CASE IN 
BELFAST HIGH COURT AGAINST FIVE MEN 
THEY SAY WERE RESPONSIBLE 
THE OMAGH BOMBING WAS THE WORST 
SINGLE ATROCITY IN THE THIRTY YEAR 
HISTORY OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND 
TROUBLES TWENTY NINE PEOPLE AND UNBORN 
TWINS WERE KILLED HUNDREDS MORE 
WERE INJURED THE FAMILIES' 
BARRISTER QUOTED THE SENIOR LOCAL 
SURGEON AS DESCRIBING IT AS A 
DISASTER OF BATTLEFIELD PROPORTIONS 
NO ONE'S BEEN CONVICT F. T. D. MURDERS 
ANY SUCH CONVICTION IS NOW HIGHLY 
UNLIKELY THE CIVIL CASE IS ON 
BEHALF OF SOME OF THE VICTIMS' 
FAMILIES WHILST TODAY WAS 
DIFFICULT 
VERY DIFFICULT VERY DIFFICULT IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT 
THE FACT THAT WE'VE CAME HERE AFTER 
SEVEN YEARS AND I THINK IT'S PROOF 
OF THE FACT THAT BOTH GOVERNMENTS 
HAVE FAILED US IN THE JUSTICE 
SYSTEM AND IT'S BASICALLY LEFT UP 
TO VICTIMS TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR 
THEMSELVES 
THE FAMILIES' CASE IS THEMSELVES AGAINST FIVE MEN COLM MURPHY 
CURRENTLY AWAITING RETRIAL IN THE 
REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ON CONSPIRACY 
CHARGES LINKED TO THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT ATTACK 
LIAM CAMPBELL SEAMUS DALY SEAMUS 
MCKENNA AND MICHAEL MCKEVITT WHO'S 
IN JAIL IN THE REPUBLIC FOR 
DIRECTING TERRORISM LORD DANIEL 
BRENNAN SAID IT WAS UNIQUE IN THE 
U. K. AND PERHAPS ROUND THE WORLD 
WHERE PRIVATE CITIZENS WERE 
CONFRONTING TERRORISM HE SAID THAT 
THEIR CASE WAS THAT THE FIVE PEN 
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMBING 
THE CASE IS EXPECTED TO LAST EIGHT 
WEEKS AND ALSO UNIQUELY THE COURT 
WILL SIT IN DUBLIN FOR TWO WEEKS TO 
TAKE EVIDENCE FROM POLICE OFFICERS 
IN THE REPUBLIC 
LET'S GO NOW TO OUTSIDE THE HIGH 
COURT IN BELFAST ALAN MCBRIDE IS 
THERE A BOARD MEMBER OF THE 
COMMUNITY PROJECT HEALING THROUGH 
REMEMBERING IT'S AT LEAST AS 
IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT YOU LOST 
YOUR WIFE SHARON AND FATHER IN LAW 
JOHN AMONG THE NINE PEOPLE KILLED 
ON THE SHANK HILL ROAD IN OCTOBER 
NINETEEN NINETY THREE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT HERE I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME 
ALL RIGHT THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A 
FAILED CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AGAINST 
ONE OF THESE MEN WHAT'S THE POINT 
OF THE CIVIL CASE 
WELL I THINK FOR 
THE FAMILIES THIS IS THEIR PURSUIT 
OF JUSTICE THEY HAVE BEEN FAILED 
BADLY BY THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THIS 
IS THE FAMILIES ATTEMPT TO GET 
RECOMPENSE FOR THE TRAUMA THEY GONE 
THROUGH I HOPE IT PROVIDES ANSWERS 
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY IT'S 
ABOUT HAVING THEIR DAY IN COURT AND 
THEY THOROUGHLY DESERVE IT WHAT WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE DAY IN COURT DO OR 
WHAT DO PEOPLE HOPE IT WILL DO IT IT GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO COME FACE TO 
FACE WITH THESE PEOPLE THAT DID 
THIS ATROCITY YOU WOULD HOPE THAT 
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO QUESTION THE 
FOLK AND THERE WOULD BE ANSWERS 
PROVIDED AND THEY MITE EVEN BE ABLE 
TO PRESS FOR COMPENSATION AT THE 
END OF THE DAY THE FAMILIES KNOW 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET PEOPLE 
BEHIND BARS REALLY WHAT THEY'RE 
DOING IS CLUTCHING AT STRAWS AND 
WHILST THERE'S STRAWS TO BE 
CLUTCHED AT THEY SHOULD DO IT WHEN 
WE THINK OF THE CIVIL CASE FOR THE 
OMAGH FAMILIES IT'S PROBABLY NOT 
POSSIBLE FOR ALL THE FAMILIES TO 
TAKE ALL THE ATROCITIES WE NEED TO 
THINK OF MORE IMAGINETIVE WAYS OF 
DEALING WITH OUR PAST BECAUSE IT'S 
OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS FAILED LOTS OF 
FAMILIES 
YOU SAY THE PEOPLE WHO FAMILIES COMMITTED THIS ATROCITY AND THEY 
DENY IT NO ONE'S BEEN CONVICTED 
YOU COME FROM A LOYALIST BACKGROUND 
WHEN YOU WERE PART OF THAT 
COMMUNITY WHEN KIDS WERE GOING TO 
SCHOOL WITH PARAMILITARY SLOGANS ON 
THEIR SCHOOL BAGS HOW FAR AS YOU 
SEE IT HAS NORTHERN IRELAND COME 
I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS THAT WENT 
WITH PARAMILITARY SLOGANS ON MY 
SCHOOL BAG NORTHERN IRELAND HAS 
COME QUITE A DISTANCE SINCE THAT 
WE HAD THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT 
TEN YEARS ON WE HAVE AN ASSEMBLY 
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO YET WE 
HAVEN'T GOT ANYWHERE NEAR THE 
SHARED SOCIETY THAT I AND SO MANY 
PEOPLE LIKE ME VOTED FOR ALL THOSE 
YEARS AGO AFTER THE GOOD FRIDAY 
AGREEMENT 
THANK YOU AGREEMENT ALAN MCBRIDE THERE 
ON SATURDAY CLASSICAL MUSIC FANS 
AROUND THE WORLD MARKED ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
SINCE THE BIRTH OF HERBERT VON 
KARAJAN THE SUPERSTAR CONDUCTOR 
HIS EMBRACE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY SUCH 
AS THE COMPACT DISC POPULARISED 
CLASSICAL MUSIC FOR MILLIONS AND 
MADE HIM A RICH MAN HE DIED IN 
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE LEAVING MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED 
RECORDINGS JAMES JOLLY LOOKS BACK 
AT HIS LEGACY HERE WE ARE IN LONDON'S ROYAL 
FESTIVAL HALL ON THE SOUTH BANK IT 
WAS TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO THAT I HEARD 
HERBERT VON KARAJAN CONDUCT THE 
BERLIN PHILHARMONIC IN BEETHOVEN'S 
FOURTH SYMPHONY PERHAPS A PROGRAMME 
TAILOR MADE FOR HIS GENIUS 
KARAJAN'S CAREER WAS TEXT BOOK HE 
LEARNED IT THE PROPER WAY THE HARD 
WAY RIGHT FROM THE BOTTOM HE WAS A 
PIANIST AS A TEENAGER BEFORE HE 
TURNED TO CONDUCTING HE DID HIS 
FIRST JOB IN ULME ONE OF HIS EARLY 
TRIUMPH WAS WAGNER TRISTAN WHICH 
TRUE FROM THE NEWSPAPER THERE THE 
WONDER KARAJAN THERE AFTER HIS 
CAREER DIDN'T LOOK BACK IT WAS 
ONWARD AND UPWARD 
IT WAS A SHADOW THAT HUNG OVER 
KARAJAN'S CAREER PARTICULARLY IN 
THE LAST TWO DECADES THAT WAS THE 
NAZI PAST HIS MEMBERSHIP OF THE 
NAZI PARTY WHICH HE JOINED IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE 
HE WOULD SAY TO FULFIL THE 
EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS AT AUKEN 
PEOPLE IN THE ANTI KARAJAN CAMP 
IT'S TOO EASY A TARGET HE WAS TOO 
HIGH PROFILE A TARGET TO IGNORE 
PEOPLE WHOM HE WORKED WITH NEVER 
EVEN KNEW HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE 
NAZI PARTY JEWISH MUSICIANS AFTER 
THE WAR BASICALLY THEY SAW IT AS A 
NECESSARY EVIL I DON'T THINK WE'LL 
EVER GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT 
IF THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN SAY 
ABOUT HIS CAREER IT WAS HE WAS 
ALWAYS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE 
RIGHT TIME AT THE END OF THE WAR 
THE LEGENDARY E. M. I. PRODUCER WALTER 
LEG DISCOVERED HIM IN VIENNA HE 
RECORDED WITH HIM IT WAS POST WAR 
THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHEN CLASSICAL MUSIC HAD 
A NEW FORMAT THE NEW PIECE OUT DID 
THE SEVENTY EIGHT KARAJAN WAS THE RIGHT MAN 
FOR THE JOB HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT 
RECORDING WAS ALL ABOUT HE 
UNDERSTOOD THE POWER OF THE 
IMMEDIATE YA HE WAS THE MOST 
VISIBLE FACE OF CLASSICAL MUSIC FOR 
TWO THREE MAYBE EVEN FOUR DECADES 
HE WAS PROBABLY THE ONE CONDUCTOR 
YOU COULD STOP A GUY IN THE STREET 
AND ASK WHO IS THAT AND THEY 
WOULD SAY KARAJAN HERE WE ARE 
NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER HIS BIRTH WHAT IS 
HIS LEGACY HE'S GOING TO BE 
REMEMBERED AS A VERY MAJOR FIGURE 
IN TWENTIETH CENTURY MUSIC PERHAPS EVEN 
MORE IMPORTANT AS A KIND OF MEDIA 
FIGURE THAN A CONDUCTOR HE 
CERTAINLY KNEW HOW TO DRIVE THE 
MEDIA I THINK IN AN AGE WHERE WE 
LACK CLASSICAL MUSIC HEROES IT'S 
TEMPT TO LOOK BACK NOSTALGICALLY 
IN A AGE WITH SUCH A COLOSSAL 
FIGURE AS HERBERT VON KARAJAN BOLERO
