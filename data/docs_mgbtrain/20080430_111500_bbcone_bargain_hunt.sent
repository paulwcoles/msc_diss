WE'VE GOT A LITTLE PAIR OF HOOVES 
VERY APPROPRIATE AT EPSOM RACECOURSE

AND THEY WALKED OFF WITH ALL THE SHOES FOR FIFTY FIVE 
HEY GIRLS COME AND HAVE A LITTLE LOOK AT THIS 
THAT'S PRETTY TWEE 
TWEE WHAT WOULD YOU USE IT FOR 
THIS LITTLE JUG I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR CREAM OR FOR MILK 
AND PART OF A SET OF COURSE IT'S FROM A BIGGER TEA OR COFFEE SET 
THIS TYPE OF DECORATION IT MAY NOT BE YOUR TASTE 
BUT IT'S STILL QUITE POPULAR 
AND IT'S VERY DISTINCTIVE FOR A CERTAIN PORCELAIN FACTORY 
ANY IDEAS ROYAL WORCESTER 
ABSOLUTELY IT IS TRUDY IT'S ROYAL WORCESTER 
IT'S WHAT WE CALL BLUSH IVORY COS THIS NICE SORT OF PEACHY GROUND 
AND IT'S PRINTED AND PAINTED WITH THESE NATURALISTIC FLOWERS 
SO IT'S QUITE A RAPID FORM OF PRODUCTION 
THE THING TO LOOK FOR PARTICULARLY WITH THIS BLUSH IVORY WARE IS ANY DAMAGE 
OR ANY RESTORATION TO THE DAMAGE THE RED TEAM WOULD KNOW 
THEY'RE RESTORERS AREN'T THEY PORCELAIN RESTORERS 
THIS BIT LOOKS ALL RIGHT TO ME LET ME JUST CHECK WITH THE STALL HOLDER 
EXCUSE ME MADAM IS THERE ANY RESTORATION AS FAR AS YOU KNOW TO THIS NO I DON'T THINK SO GREAT 
I MEAN I'VE GIVEN IT A TING LOVELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH O. K. 
WHAT AGE IS IT WELL IF WE TURN IT OVER WE CAN SEE 
THE DISTINCTIVE ROYAL WORCESTER PUCE MARK ON THE BASE THERE 
AND THIS SYSTEM OF DOTS ACTUALLY HELPS YOU TO DATE THE PIECE 
IT CAME IN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
AND THIS I WOULD THINK IS VERY EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS 
NINETEEN OH THREE I WOULD THINK SOMEWHERE ROUND THERE 
IT'S GROWING ON ME YEAH YES ALL RIGHT WHAT'S THE PRICE 
SEVENTY IT'S GONNA HAVE TO COME DOWN A BIT 
EXCUSE ME YOU'VE GOT THIS ON OFFER FOR SEVENTY 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU TAKE FOR IT 
LET'S SEE WHAT I CAN DO IT FOR 
WILL YOU TAKE FIFTY FIVE FOR IT YES I'LL TAKE FIFTY FIVE YES 
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL DONE GIRLS 
HOW ABOUT THIS FOR THE ULTIMATE CHARMING OBJECT 
TO GRACE YOUR BREAKFAST TABLE 
WHY PARTICULARLY BREAKFAST TABLE WELL OF COURSE TRADITIONALLY 
IF YOU CONSUME EGGS YOUR BOILED BUBBY 
WOULD NORMALLY BE EATEN AT BREAKFAST 
BUT YOU COULD JUST AS EASILY I SUPPOSE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
HAVE HAD A BOILED EGG 
WITH YOUR HIGH TEA TOO 
THIS THING UTILISES A PERFECT CIRCULAR OSIER FORM 
THIS OUTER BASKET LIKE STRUCTURE 
WITHIN THAT WE'VE GOT A CABLE EDGED FRAME 
AND ASTRIDE THE FRAME IS THIS SWEET LITTLE NEWBORN CHICK 
JUST FLEXING ITS WINGS 
THE FIRST RECEPTACLE IS THAT NEWBORN CHICK'S EGGSHELL 
AND WE'VE GOT IT WITH THE PERFECTLY SERRATED EDGE 
AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR THE SALT 
NEXT DOOR IS ANOTHER PERFECT EGG 
THIS TIME PIERCED WITH HOLES SO YOU COULD USE IT AS A PEPPER 
AND THE LAST EGG IN THE TRIO IS THIS FELLOW 
AND IF I OPEN THAT UP YOU CAN SEE THAT IT CONTAINS 
THE ORIGINAL SPOON AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR MUSTARD 
YOU KNOW IT'S THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE THE TERMINAL IS CAST AS AN EAR OF CORN 
AND IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE CIRCULAR EARS OF CORN 
THAT GO TO MAKE UP THESE DIVISIONS IT IS IDENTICAL 
SO THAT'S A MIRACLE TO HAVE THE ORIGINAL SPOON REMAINING IN ITS MUSTARD 
NOW THIS THING HAD BEEN DESIGNED AND MADE BY AN EXTREMELY CLEVER MAKER 
IF I TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN YOU SEE THAT IT'S MARKED 
MAPPIN AND WEBB SHEFFIELD AND LONDON 
AND THEY WERE THE PRE EMINENT MAKERS OF ELECTROPLATED NICKEL GOODS 
AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT'S ALSO GOT A KITEMARK 
AND THE KITEMARK HERE IF YOU DECIPHER IT TELLS YOU 
THAT THE DESIGN FOR THIS THING WAS REGISTERED 
ON THE TWENTY FIRST FEBRUARY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO 
SO WE KNOW WHEN THIS THING WAS MADE 
WE KNOW WHICH CLEVER PERSON MADE IT AND WE KNOW IT'S JOLLY AMUSING 
I'VE SEEN ONE OF THESE SELL IN SOLID SILVER 
FOR BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND 
THIS ONE IS ONLY IN PLATE BUT NEVERTHELESS IT SHOULD REALISE 
PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED 
YET IT'S AVAILABLE HERE FOR ONLY FIFTY FIVE QUID 
NOW THAT HAS TO BE CHEEP 
AH GIRLS 
HERE'S SOMETHING BROKEN DO YOU THINK YOU COULD PUT THOSE TOGETHER 
OH MY GOODNESS LOOK AT THOSE 
WE COULD DO SOMETHING WITH IT DEFINITELY IT WILL BE A CHALLENGE YES IT WOULD 
I NEED NEW TEETH 
DEFINITELY MAKE HIM SOME NEW TEETH 
WE COULD DO TEETH UM WE COULD MODEL A NOSE THERE'S A LOT MORE TO COME UNDERNEATH 
JUST A BIT 
BUT SURELY THERE'S NO MONEY IN OLD BONES AND THINGS 
ON THE CONTRARY PEOPLE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TYPE OF THING IT'S UNUSUAL 
IT'S THAT WEE BIT DIFFERENT AND THE MARKET IS GOOD FOR ANYTHING UNUSUAL 
WE HAVE A BROWN ENVELOPE HERE LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND 
LET'S ASK THE STALL HOLDER WHERE SHE GOT THEM YES 
TELL US ABOUT THESE 
I DON'T KNOW AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT THEM EXCEPT THAT THE GENTLEMAN WHO OWNED THEM DIED 
AND HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS SO THEY WEREN'T DUG UP OR ANYTHING 
GOOD HEAVENS NO THEY WERE JUST DONATIONS AND IF YOU LOOK VERY CAREFULLY THERE ARE SOME WORDS 
WRITTEN UNDER THE SKULLS AND UNDER SOME OF THE BONES SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY FOR STUDENTS A TEACHING AID 
PRICE ON THIS BAG OF OLD BONES SEVENTY FIVE 
SEVENTY FIVE 
COULD YOU COME DOWN A LITTLE ON THAT I COULD DO A LITTLE BIT ON IT SIXTY FIVE 
OH 
WOULD YOU DO FIFTY FIVE 
YES I WOULD 
ALL RIGHT FIFTY FIVE THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
REAL BARGAIN MISSUS 
CONNECTED TO THE NECK BONE 
THE NECK BONE'S CONNECTED TO THE SHOULDER BONE 
THE SHOULDER BONE'S CONNECTED TO THE BACK BONE 
WHAT CAN YOU SEE ON HERE ANYTHING WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS KATE 
NOW THAT IS THE SORT OF PIECE THAT I WOULD PICK ANNE WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN THIS 
IT'S VERY DELICATE VERY PRETTY 
LOOKS VERY CLEAN AND SHINY SO IT'S IN QUITE GOOD CONDITION 
ANYTHING ELSE HAVE YOU NOTICED A NAME YES IT'S MAPPIN AND AMP WEBB 
AND I KNOW THAT THEY'RE A SILVERSMITH'S 
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S A VERY GOOD NAME AND I THINK WITH SILVER THAT ACTUALLY ADDS QUITE A BIT 
I SUPPOSE YOU'D CALL IT A BONBON DISH PUT SWEETIES IN IT 
AND THE NICE THING ABOUT IT IT'S STILL REALLY CRISP SILVER'S QUITE A SOFT METAL 
IF IT'S POLISHED TOO MUCH IT WILL WEAR DOWN BUT YOU CAN SEE THIS PATTERN IN THE LEAF THAT'S BEEN CAST 
IS REALLY NICE AND SHARP AND THE HALLMARK WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S REALLY NICE AND CRISP 
NOW THAT SAYS TO ME THAT IT DATES FROM NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT SO IT'S GEORGE THE SIXTH PERIOD 
THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF AGE TO IT WHAT ABOUT YOU TWO DO YOU LIKE IT 
YEP IT'S A LOVELY PIECE IT'S VERY CLEAN 
I PERSONALLY WOULD BUY IT I WOULD BUY IT BUT NOT AT THAT PRICE 
WELL THEY SAY NINETY SIX WELL YOU NEVER KNOW 
WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE CHAT WITH THEM SEE IF THEY'RE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE A LITTLE BIT 
WHO'S THE BEST NEGOTIATOR OUT OF YOU TWO SHE IS 
THAT WAS VERY DEFINITE GO ON THEN ANNE I'LL GO FOR IT DO YOUR BEST 
ANNE DID THE DEAL ON THE DISH FOR SIXTY QUID 
THERE'S SOME GREAT ITEMS BEING BOUGHT OUT THERE

KATE HI GIRLS FIVE MINUTES TO GO YEAH NOT LONG OOH 
BIT OF DOULTON YEP I REALLY LIKE IT I REALLY DO 
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT I LIKE THE COLOURS THE SHAPE 
I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S GOT THAT THREE DIMENSIONAL EFFECT 
THIS IS MOULDED IN RELIEF RATHER THAN JUST A FLAT DECORATIVE PLATE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ANNE IT'S UNUSUAL OBVIOUSLY IT'S H. M. S. VICTORY ISN'T IT THAT'S RIGHT 
SO IT WILL HAVE AN INTEREST TO PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THINGS TO DO WITH SHIPS UH HUH 
WELL THAT IS A VERY GOOD POINT 
YEAH COS WE'VE GOT IT TITLED DOWN HERE H. M. S. VICTORY 
WE'VE GOT THE ASSOCIATION WITH TRAFALGAR WITH NELSON 
SO IT OPENS UP THAT AREA OF THE MARKET AS WELL IT'S GOT A DOUBLE EDGE TO IT IF YOU LIKE 
BUT THE THING ABOUT THE DOULTON FACTORY IS THAT IT JUST PRODUCED SUCH A VARIETY OF WARES 
BUT THIS REMINDS ME VERY MUCH OF THE SORT OF SERIES WARE THEY PRODUCED 
DECORATIVE PLATES AND DISHES PRINTED WITH A SERIES 
LIKE TO DO WITH CHARLES DICKENS FOR INSTANCE ONE 
HOW OLD IS IT I WOULD PUT THIS 
AT ABOUT THE NINETEEN THIRTIES TYPICAL FOR THIS TYPE OF PALETTE 
TURN IT OVER WE'VE GOT 
THE CORRECT STANDARD DOULTON MARK THERE 
U. IS FROM THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES BUT QUITE INTERESTINGLY IT SAYS HERE 
REGISTERED IN AUSTRALIA WHICH IS INTERESTING 
SO MAYBE THE DOULTON FACTORY 
PRODUCED ITEMS SUCH AS THIS FOR THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET AS WELL 
WOULD THAT MAKE IT ANY MORE VALUABLE IT ADDS A LITTLE BIT OF INTEREST 
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO ADD VALUE AS SUCH WHAT ABOUT THE PRICE 
THEY WANT NINETY EIGHT FOR IT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT WELL I THINK IT'S TOO MUCH 
IF WE COULD GET THAT DOWN YEAH 
THEN YEP I MEAN AT AUCTION 
I REALLY DO LIKE IT DO YOU YEAH 
SHE'S QUITE STRUCK ON THIS ISN'T SHE YEAH

AND THEY FLOATED THEIR BOAT FOR SEVENTY 
GIRLS WE HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TIME LEFT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
HAVE A LOOK AT IT WE REALLY WANT TO GET SOME CERAMICS FOR YOU GIRLS 
LOVELY TELL ME ABOUT THE CONDITION 
THERE'S NO CRACKS 
THERE'S A FLAW BUT THAT'S ONLY A FIRING FLAW 
SO THAT'S NOT A DEFECT 
SOME PEOPLE LIKE FIRING CRACKS RESTORED REALLY I'M AGAINST THAT 
IT'S PART OF THE CHARM AND THE HERITAGE OF THE PIECE 
EXACTLY YES IT'S COME AS IT WAS FROM THE KILN 
HOW OLD IS IT IT'S THE LATE PART OF THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY 
IF YOU HAVE A LOOK UNDERNEATH WE'LL SEE THE BACK STAMP 
AND I'M SURE I DON'T NEED TO MENTION THIS TO YO U. 
BUT WE HAVE IT'S HOLLAND AND GREEN 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN ALL THINGS ORIENTAL 
AND THIS WAS REFLECTED IN YOUR DECORATIVE AND FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS 
AND WE HAVE THIS ORIENTAL TRANSFER PRINTED PATTERN HERE 
YES AND I KNOW YOU LADIES AREN'T KEEN ON TRANSFER PRINTING NO WHY 
WELL IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO RESTORE 
BECAUSE IF YOU GET A BREAK THROUGH THE TRANSFER 
YOU INVARIABLY GET A BREAK WHERE THE TRANSFER JOINS 
SO YOU'RE RESTORING A FAULT WHERE THE TRANSFER WAS YES

THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE'LL FIND OUT LATER 
JUST HOW GOOD THE EXPERTS' BONUS BUY REALLY IS OOH 
BEFORE THE AUCTION HERE IN SURREY 
LET'S VISIT A MAGICAL PLACE IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF COMPTON 
THE WATTS GALLERY IS DEDICATED TO THE WORK OF ARTIST GEORGE FREDERICK WATTS 
A COMPLEX FIGURE WATTS ACQUIRED THE TITLE ENGLAND'S MICHELANGELO 
HE WAS A HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED PAINTER AND LIKE THE RENAISSANCE MASTER WAS ALSO A SCULPTOR 
BORN IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HIS EARLY ARTISTIC TRAINING TOOK PLACE IN A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO 
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES THAT HE STARTED TO TAKE THE SUBJECT REALLY SERIOUSLY 
IN THE MID ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES WATTS MADE HIS FIRST MAJOR SCULPTURE AT THE REQUEST OF A FRIEND 
OTHER COMMISSIONS FOLLOWED AND ENGLAND'S PAINTER POET 
WAS ENCOURAGED TO WORK MORE AND MORE IN THREE DIMENSIONS 
WATTS LIKE MICHELANGELO USED TO SCULPT 
SMALL FIGURES THAT HE INTENDED INTRODUCING INTO HIS PAINTINGS 
AFTER A BIT BY THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES 
HE WAS SCULPTING FULLY FORMED INDEPENDENT PIECES 
LIKE THIS FAMOUS IMAGE OF CLYTIE 
HERE WE'VE GOT THE GREEK NYMPH THAT WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A SUNFLOWER 
BECAUSE OF HER HOPELESS LOVE OF APOLLO 
AT THIS MOMENT HER HEAD IS STRAINING TO ONE SIDE 
AS SHE'S DESPERATE TO GET THOSE LAST RAYS OF SUNSHINE 
THIS IS THE POWERFUL MOMENT OF THE METAMORPHOSIS 
WHERE HER BODY IS CHANGING INTO AN ORGANIC GROWTH 
THE SUNFLOWER ITSELF 
LATER IN LIFE HE TURNED TO MONUMENTAL PIECES OF SCULPTURE 
FOR EXAMPLE THIS THE MODEL FOR TENNYSON'S STATUE 
WHICH STANDS OUTSIDE LINCOLN CATHEDRAL TODAY 
AND WHAT GREATER MEMORIAL COULD YOU HAVE FOR SUCH A GREAT POET 
WELL THIS BABY TAKES SOME BEATING I CAN TELL YOU LOOK AT THAT 
KNOWN AS PHYSICAL ENERGY 
IT'S THE LARGEST SCULPTURE EVER CREATED FOR THE SCULPTOR'S PLEASURE 
THAT MEANS HE MADE IT WITHOUT HAVING A COMMISSION OR HAVING SOLD IT BEFOREHAND 
IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE MATERIAL USED TO SCULPT IT ISN'T CLAY 
HE FOUND LATER ON IN LIFE THAT CLAY MADE HIS HANDS RHEUMATIC 
SO HE SCULPTED THIS IN A MIXTURE OF PLASTER AND FIBROUS MATERIAL 
RATHER MORE DIFFICULT TO WORK BUT EASIER ON THE HANDS 
WHAT'S THE POINT BEHIND PHYSICAL ENERGY 
WELL HERE WE HAVE MAN'S DOMINATION OF A BEAST 
JUST LOOK AT THE INCREDIBLE STRENGTH OF THIS HORSE 
THAT'S WILL HAS BEEN BENT TO MAN'S 
AND THAT'S THE POINT PHYSICAL ENERGY 
WATTS EVENTUALLY ALLOWED ONE OR TWO BRONZE CASTS OF PHYSICAL ENERGY 
AND IF YOU'RE A LONDONER AND YOU GO TO KENSINGTON GARDENS YOU MIGHT JUST RECOGNISE IT 
NOW WHAT I WANT TO RECOGNISE TODAY IS 
ARE OUR TEAMS GOING TO DISPLAY ANY PHYSICAL ENERGY 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE SALE OF THEIR ITEMS OVER AT THE AUCTION 
IT'S VERY NICE TO BE NESTLING IN THE HEART OF SURREY 
AT LAWRENCES SALEROOM IN BLETCHINGLEY 
AND OUR AUCTIONEER TODAY IS ROBIN LAWRENCE HIMSELF GOOD MORNING TIM 
NICE TO SEE YOU NOW KATHY LESLEY AND ANITA 
OUR RED TEAM WENT WITH THIS WACKY ECCENTRIC BUY WITH THE HUMAN BONES 
NOW HOW ARE YOU ON HUMAN BONES HERE 
WELL IT'S NOT OUR SPECIALITY 
NO IT'S SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT FOR THE AUCTION 
WE'RE PLUMPING FOR A FIFTY TO EIGHTY ESTIMATE 
FIFTY TO EIGHTY FOR ALL THESE BONES WELL IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SPECULATIVE ITEM 
IT IS A WACKY LOT I HAVE TO SAY I THINK IT'S GREAT FUN YEAH 
FIFTY TO EIGHTY MY PREDICTION IS YOU'LL MAKE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR THE WHOLE LOT 
AND WE'LL ALL BE ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WE'LL DO OUR BEST I HOPE ANYWAY 
TWO PAIRS OF VICTORIAN SHOES 
WITH THE LASTS AND ALL THAT I MEAN 
THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING MUCH FOR ME I HAVE TO SAY 
NO THEY'RE NOT A VERY INSPIRING ITEM I DON'T THINK 
POSSIBLY THEY'RE SOMETHING FROM CENTRAL EUROPE OR EASTERN EUROPE YES 
BUT I DON'T ENVISAGE THERE BEING A GREAT MARKET FOR THOSE THEY LOOK SO WORN OUT DON'T THEY 
THEY DO AND SAD SOMEHOW 
TWENTY TO FORTY IS OUR EXPECTATION 
O. K. FIFTY FIVE FIFTY FIVE TOO MUCH YES 
I THINK IT PROBABLY IS TOO AND THIS IS 
I SUPPOSE IT'S QUITE AN AMUSING PATTERN ON THIS DRESSING TABLE SET 
BIT OF CHINOISERIE INFLUENCE THERE YES PRETTY STANDARD FARE 
BUT IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION NOT ALL COMPLETE YOU WANT A BIT MORE YES 
THERE SHOULD BE PERHAPS A PAIL OR A CHAMBER POT TO GO WITH IT 
BUT EVEN SO I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY EXPECT THIRTY TO FIFTY FOR THAT ONE 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT THEY PAID FORTY I DON'T THINK THEY'LL LOSE ON THAT THEY SHOULDN'T ANYWAY 
GOOD WELL OVERALL IT'S LOOKING PRETTY MARGINAL 
THEY MAY NOT NEED THEIR BONUS BUY BUT I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
NOW LESLEY AND KATHY YOU HAD A GREAT SHOP UP ONE HUNDRED FIFTY WORTH OF LEFT OVER LOLLY WENT TO ANITA 
WHAT HAS SHE SPENT IT ON 
YES 
WELL KATHY LOVES PIGEONS DOES SHE 
BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A PIGEON 
I SEARCHED THE FAIR FOR A PIGEON BUT ALL I COULD FIND WAS A BUDGIE 
A POOR MAN'S PIGEON 
HE'S ROYAL ADDERLEY WHICH WAS ONE OF THE STOKE FACTORIES AND HE'S ABOUT NINETEEN SIXTIES 
HE'S VERY PRETTY HIS NAME'S JOEY 
AND I PAID TWENTY FIVE FOR HIM 
DID YOU I DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT TO SAY ABOUT HIM 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE'LL SELL FOR IF THERE ARE BIRD FANCIERS IN THE AUCTION 
NOT PIGEON FANCIERS I'M SURE THERE WILL BE WE ARE IN SURREY 
YES IT IS THE EPICENTRE OF THE BUDGIE REGION 
LET'S NOT BE SNIFFY ABOUT THIS NO LET'S NOT 
THEY'VE ALL GOT CAGES IN THEIR FRONT ROOMS HERE WE COULD MAKE A SMALL PROFIT 
THIS BUDGIE IS NOT GOING TO DOUBLE HIS MONEY NO 
THIS BUDGIE'S DEFINITELY DEAD 
ANYWAY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VIEWERS LET US FIND OUT 
WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS OF THE DEAD BUDGIE 
SO ROBIN ARE YOU A FANCIER YOURSELF 
NOT OF BUDGIES OH RIGHT WE'VE SOLD ON OR TWO OF THESE IN RECENT MONTHS 
AND THERE ARE A FEW COLLECTORS OF ADDERLEY BUT NOT AT VERY HIGH PRICES 
I'M THINKING TEN TO TWENTY WITH THIS ONE WE'D BETTER LEAVE IT IN ITS CAGE THEN 
TWENTY FIVE PAID BY ANITA YOU NEVER KNOW THOUGH I COULD BE WRONG 
YEAH THERE ARE A FEW TWITS ABOUT 
ANYWAY THAT SEEMS TO BE IT FOR THE REDS NOW FOR THE BLUES 
THEIR FIRST ITEM IS THE MAPPIN AND AMP WEBB LITTLE BONBON DISH 
WHAT DOES THAT SCALE WORK ON THE TOP REMIND YOU OF ROBIN 
IT'S A LITTLE REMINISCENT OF THE CHRYSLER BUILDING ISN'T IT IN NEW YORK CITY 
THAT SORT OF SCALY ROOF SECTION ON THE TOP OF THE BUILDING 
YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOES FOR ME ANYWAY YES 
IT'S RATHER GOOD IT'S VERY NICE A GOOD QUALITY PIECE 
WHEN WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THEN IT'S ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTIES I THINK O. K. BRILLIANT 
YEAH VERY SALEABLE ITEM 
WE'RE THINKING FORTY TO SIXTY O. K. SIXTY PAID 
THERE MAY BE A SMALL PROFIT IN IT BUT IT PROBABLY WON'T TAKE OFF 
WHAT ABOUT THE BLUSH IVORY CREAM JUG 
IS THAT NOT A SINGLE ITEM THAT JUST MAKES YOU QUAKE IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART 
I MEAN HOW DIFFICULT IS THAT TO SELL 
QUITE TRICKY IT'S A VERY STANDARD PIECE OF WORCESTER 
THERE ARE HAND PAINTED SIGNED PIECES AROUND WHICH ARE MORE COLLECTABLE 
IT'S QUITE A PRETTY LITTLE THING BUT NOT OF GREAT VALUE 
WE FEEL THIRTY TO FIFTY MIGHT BE POSSIBLE 
HE'S SO POLITE ABOUT IT 
I MEAN I'D JUST SEE THAT AS A DESPERATELY DIFFICULT OBJECT 
ANYWAY THEY PAID FIFTY FIVE FOR IT 
THAT SEEMS A LITTLE STRONG I PREDICT YOU'LL STRUGGLE AROUND TWENTY FIVE BUT GOOD LUCK 
THE LAST ITEM IS THIS VICTORY MOULDED BOWL 
FRUIT BOWL I SUPPOSE ROYAL DOULTON 
YES IT'S FROM A RANGE OF WARES WHICH DOULTON PRODUCED 
IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES CALLED SERIES WARE 
THIS ONE DECORATED WITH H. M. S. VICTORY 
AND THERE'S A BIT OF A COLLECTORS' MARKET FOR THOSE 
WE'RE THINKING PROBABLY FORTY TO SIXTY FOR THAT 
I RATHER AGREE FORTY TO SIXTY IS THE RIGHT ESTIMATE 
THEY PAID SEVENTY HMM 
I THINK THEY MUST HAVE HAD A FLUSH OF NAVAL ENTHUSIASM OR SOMETHING 
PERHAPS OVERALL I THINK THAT'S A REALLY DODGY TRIO 
AND DEFINITELY THEY WILL NEED THEIR BONUS BUY 
LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
NOW DO YOU REMEMBER THAT YOU GAVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN TO THAT KATE YES 
WELL SHE'S SPENT ALL OF IT I HOPE WHAT HAVE YOU SPENT AND WHAT HAVE YOU BOUGHT KATE 
WELL YOU'VE BOUGHT QUITE TRADITIONAL THINGS REALLY DOULTON WORCESTER 
SO I HAVE BOUGHT YOU SOMETHING WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT OF FUN

AND IT'S NINETEEN FIFTY NINE IN DATE ACTUALLY 
YOU'RE SO DELIGHTED AREN'T YOU 
REALLY BUT I PAID THIRTY FOR IT 
NOW I FOUND ONE ON THE INTERNET FOR SIXTY FIVE 
SO I THINK IN THAT CONDITION IN THAT CONDITION 
IN FACT IT WAS WORSE 
SO I THINK FOR SOMEBODY WITH AN EYE THERE MIGHT BE A SMALL CHANCE OF A PROFIT IN THAT 
YOU WON'T DECIDE UNTIL AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS 
BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VIEWERS AT HOME LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT OLD NODDY 
SO ROBIN HOW DO YOU RATE THAT LITTLE FELLOW 
I THINK IT'S QUITE A NICE LITTLE PIECE A NURSERY ALARM CLOCK 
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THROUGH AT LEAST ONE NURSERY IN ITS LIFE DOESN'T IT 
THE CONDITION PERHAPS NOT ALL IT COULD BE 
AND FOR THAT REASON WE'RE KEEPING THE ESTIMATE DOWN AT TEN TO TWENTY 
TEN TO TWENTY WELL KATE I THINK MIGHT HAVE GOT CARRIED AWAY SHE PAID THIRTY FOR IT 
SHE RATES IT AS HER BONUS BUY BUT WE'LL HAVE TO HOPE FOR THE BEST 
INDEED HOW LONG BEFORE THE AUCTION STARTS ABOUT EIGHT HOURS 
BUT ACTUALLY WE'LL SEE YOU UP THERE IN A MINUTE THANKS 
ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BRITAIN IS KNOWING WHERE TO STORE YOUR BITS OF COTTON 
WELL OF COURSE THE SAME PROBLEM DID EXIST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AND THEY SOLVED IT RATHER CUNNINGLY WITH A LITTLE DEVICE LIKE THIS 
LOOKS LIKE A BARREL DOESN'T IT 
WOODEN SIDES HAVE BEEN ENCLOSED BY THESE NICELY MADE BRASS BANDS 
IT'S EVEN GOT A LITTLE TAP BUT THE TRUTH OF THE THING IS 
THAT IF I SPIN THAT LITTLE SPINDLE ON THE TOP 
YOU CAN HEAR THAT THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE 
IF I UNSCREW THE TOP IT REVEALS A BOBBIN 
THERE'S THE BOBBIN WHICH WOULD HAVE HAD COTTON ON IT 
YOU SIMPLY TAKE THE END OF THE PIECE OF COTTON 
THREAD THE END OF THE PIECE OF COTTON THROUGH THAT SPOUT THAT WAY 
YOU CAN YANK OFF WHATEVER LENGTH OF COTTON YOU WANT 
AND THEN GIVE IT A LITTLE SNIP ON WHAT IS IN EFFECT 
A RAZOR BLADE ON THE TOP OF THE TAP 
TODAY YOU MIGHT NOT BE SO WORRIED ABOUT WHERE YOU KEEP YOUR COTTON 
BUT SOMEBODY WOULD BUY THIS BECAUSE IT'S AN EXQUISITE PIECE OF TREEN 
BEAUTIFULLY TURNED BY A BLOKE ON A LATHE OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS AGO SO WHAT'S IT WORTH 
WELL HOW LONG'S A PIECE OF STRING 
THE AUCTION ESTIMATE IS FIFTY TO EIGHTY BUT WHAT IT ACTUALLY BRINGS 
WILL BE REVEALED IN A MOMENT IN THE AUCTION
