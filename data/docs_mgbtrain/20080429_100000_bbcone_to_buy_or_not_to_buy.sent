WESTON SUPER MARE TO BE PRECISE 
FOR SUN SAND STICKS OF ROCK AND TO SEE IF WE CAN LICK A PARTICULARLY TRICKY PROPERTY HUNT 
DO YOU WANT TO NIBBLE MINE 
NOW MANY PEOPLE DREAM OF SELLING UP AND MOVING TO LIVE BESIDE THE SEA 
WHY NOT GOLDEN BEACHES BRACING SEA AIR IT'S GOOD FOR THE CONSTITUTION DON'T YOU KNOW 
YEAH SOUNDS GOOD TO ME TODAY'S COUPLE LIVE FAR FROM THE SEA 
THEIR NEW HOME MUST ALSO PLUG THE GENERATION GAP 
WHICH MEANS SIMON YOU AND I HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT 
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO FIND THEM THREE PERFECT PROPERTIES THEN HAND OVER THE KEYS TO THEIR FAVOURITE 
SO THEY CAN TRY BEFORE THEY BUY 
TODAY'S BUYERS ARE DAVE AND MAGGIE PITT 
WHO WE'VE WHISKED DOWN TO WESTON SUPER MARE FROM THEIR HOME IN REDDITCH IN THE MIDLANDS 
MAGGIE IS A TEACHER AND DAVE USED TO BE A WIMBLEDON LINE JUDGE 
OUT SO HE'LL BE HOPING WE SERVE UP A WINNER IN THE PROPERTY STAKES 
AS ALL THEIR KIDS HAVE GROWN UP AND LEFT HOME LEAVING MAGGIE AND DAVE WITH NO TIES TO THEIR CURRENT PLACE 
THEY'VE DECIDED THEY WANT TO LIVE BY THE SEA 
BUT THEY WON'T BE MOVING TO WESTON ALONE 
PART OF THEIR PLAN IS TO FIND SOMEWHERE THAT MAGGIE'S MUM JEAN CAN SHARE WITH THEM 
SO MAGGIE AND DAVE YOU CURRENTLY LIVE IN REDDITCH IN THE MIDLANDS 
YOU WANT TO UP STICKS MOVE TO A NEW LOCATION 
ANYWHERE ON THE BRITISH ISLES AND YOU'VE GONE FOR WESTON SUPER MARE WHY BECAUSE WE LIKE IT 
OUR JOB IS DONE LET'S GO 
THAT WAS TOUGH ASK A SILLY QUESTION GET A SILLY ANSWER 
IS IT JUST YOU TWO 
NO MUM'S COMING TO LIVE WITH US AS WELL RIGHT 
WHEN YOU SAY MUM IS COMING TO LIVE WITH DO YOU ACTUALLY MEAN WITHIN THE SAME HOUSE SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO 
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR EXACTLY 
MAINLY WITHIN THE HOUSE THAT SHE'S CLOSE BY 
SHE WANTS TO BE WITH US BUT INDEPENDENT AS WELL 
SO AN ANNEX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT HOW MANY BEDROOMS ARE WE LOOKING 
THREE 
THREE THERE'S ONLY YOU TWO AND YOU WANT A FLAT FOR MUM 
NO WE'VE GOT THREE KIDS AS WELL SO ALL FLOWN THE COUP SO ROOM TO PUT THEM UP AS WELL 
THEY OFTEN COME TO CALL UNANNOUNCED 
STYLE AGE ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THIS HOUSE OR DON'T YOU CARE 
STYLE AGE NOT REALLY 
WE'VE GOT NO PRE SET REQUIREMENTS AT ALL 
PERHAPS JUST GOT TO BE PRACTICAL 
THREE BEDROOMS PRACTICAL 
THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS HOW MUCH 
WE'VE SET OUR BUDGET AT TOPS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT WE'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE COULD COME SOME WAY BELOW THAT 
I TELL YOU WHAT WITHIN YOUR BUDGET I'M GONNA START RUNNING NOW 
NOT FROM ESCAPING YOU OBVIOUSLY TO FIND THE HOUSES LET'S GO 
O. K. THEN 
WELL CHRISTIAN I THINK THE TIDE COULD BE AGAINST US ON THIS ONE 
THERE CERTAINLY IS AN UNDERCURRENT BECAUSE THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT IT IF WE WERE FINDING THEM JUST A HOUSE 
THAT WOULD BE FINE BUT WITH THE ANNEX AS WELL FOR MUM WITH THEIR BUDGET 
QUITE FRANKLY WE COULD BE LIKE TWO STRUGGLING BEACHED WHALES 
YOU'RE RIGHT THE SANDS OF TIME ARE ALREADY RUNNING OUT 
WE'D BETTER GET CRACKING SO IS MY PATIENCE WITH BAD LINES LIKE THAT 
COME ON GIVE ME A BREAK 
RIGHT I'M GOING TO MEET THE GOOD PEOPLE OF WESTON SUPER MARE 
YOU CAN GO AND TAKE A PIER IN THE ESTATE AGENTS 
OH HE'S SHELLING OUT THE BAD LINES 
IN MANY WAYS WESTON SUPER MARE IS THE ARCHETYPAL SEASIDE TOWN 
KISS ME QUICK HATS DONKEY RIDES AND FISH AND CHIPS ON THE PROM 
SOUNDS DELIGHTFUL BUT STEP BACK FROM THE BUSY SEAFRONT 
AND WESTON'S MANY BUILDINGS AND PUBLIC SPACES ARE TESTAMENT TO ITS VICTORIAN HEYDAY 
WE HAD A TOURIST BOOM AT THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY 
NOT ONE BUT TWO PIERS WERE BUILT TO ACCOMMODATE THE INFLUX 
SO WHILE WE EXPLORE WESTON SUPER MARE AND THE SURROUNDING AREA 
LET'S SEE WHAT DAVE AND MAGGIE'S TWO HUNDRED K. WILL GET THEM IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
UP IN THE RED ROSE COUNTY OF LANCASHIRE 
THIS FOUR BEDROOM SEMI IN PRESTON HAS GOT GREAT VIEWS 
A LARGE BACK GARDEN AND A MASTER BEDROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
WITHIN BUDGET TOO AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WHAT ABOUT THIS DETACHED HOUSE IN SOUTH WALES 
THREE BEDROOMS THREE RECEPTION ROOMS AND TWO BATHROOMS 
MEANS THERE'LL BE MORE THAN ENOUGH SPACE FOR MAGGIE DAVE AND JEAN 
IT'S ALL FOR TWO HUNDRED GRAND 
FINALLY HOW ABOUT THIS BIG FOUR BEDROOMED FAMILY HOME ON THE SEAFRONT IN SUNDERLAND 
THERE'S A LARGE GROUND FLOOR BEDROOM AND BATHROOM FOR JEAN 
AND THE ASKING PRICE IS A POUND UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BUT DAVE AND MAGGIE WANT IT TO BE WESTON SUPER MARE SO LET'S OBLIGE THEM 
HELLO I'M PHONING ABOUT THE PROPERTY YOU'VE GOT ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP BYE BYE TOO SEASIDEY FOR MY LIKING I LIKE QUIET PLACES 
CAN I ASK WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU EXPECTING FROM WESTON SUPER MARE 
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAVE ANY PROPERTIES AT ALL WITH AN ANNEX NO 
I'M SORRY I DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH 
DO YOU BY ANY CHANCE HAVE ANY PROPERTIES ON YOUR BOOKS THAT HAVE A GRANNY ANNEX 
ONE POINT FIVE OH 
ONE POINT FIVE OH RUN 
O. K. IT WAS WORTH A TRY 
YOU SEE THIS IT'S FAKE 
I WANT TO KNOW IF I CAN GET A THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE 
YES MOST DEFINITELY PROBLEM IS I WANT A GREAT BIG GRANNY ANNEX 
PLENTY OF FRESH AIR 
IT IS FRESH AT TIMES 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WILL GET ME WHAT 
NOT THE ANNEX A THREE OR FOUR BEDROOMED HOUSE OFF THE SEAFRONT 
WHERE WOULD WE BE LOOKING TO BUY WHERE WOULD YOU RECOMMEND 
WELL WHERE WE LIVE REALLY UPHILL 
A SEMI DETACHED FOUR BEDROOM I LIKE IT 
I HAVE TO BE HONEST IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND THESE HOUSES HAVE GOT A LOT OF BEDROOMS IN YES 
BUT YOU SAY I WON'T GET A SEPARATE ANNEX OR SOME KIND OF BIG EXTENSION AT THE BACK FOR THE MONEY NO 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IN WESTON YOU'D PROBABLY END UP GETTING A THREE BEDROOM 
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR SO THAT'S GOOD 
FANTASTIC SO YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT AREA FOR THAT 
I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT THAT HI I'VE JUST SEEN A PROPERTY IN YOUR WINDOW 
IT'S A THREE BEDROOM THAT'S THE ONE THE FAIRLY MODERN ONE 
WE'RE MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS HERE YES I KNOW 
IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY'S HOME WE'VE TO BE THOROUGH ABOUT THIS HAVEN'T WE 
THAT SOUNDS PERFECT 
CAN I VIEW THAT IMMEDIATELY 
I HAVE FOUND A VERY VERY LOVELY PROPERTY 
VICTORIAN VERY MUCH OF THE AREA 
VICTORIAN HOUSE LOADS OF CHARM AND HAS THAT SPACE FOR MOTHER 
I'VE GOT COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE I'VE GONE MODERN 
RIGHT BUT IT DOES STILL NEED A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO BRING IT UP 
TO THE SPECIFICATION THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR BUT IT'S A BARGAIN 
I THINK IT'S NICE WE'RE OFFERING THEM A VARIETY 
TALKING OF VARIETY YOU SHOULD SEE OUR WILD CARD TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 
NOT ONLY HAS IT GOT A VERY INTERESTING FRONTAGE 
IT'S THE INTERIOR THAT IS FRANKLY NOT SHOCKING BUT UNUSUAL IT'S GOT A LOT OF POTENTIAL HASN'T IT 
IT CERTAINLY HAS POTENTIAL IS THE KEY WORD WITH THIS PROPERTY BUT WILL THEY BE ABLE TO SEE THAT 
WELL WE'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT THAT'S AFTER THEY'VE VIEWED PROPERTY NUMBER ONE COME ON 
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE MY CHOICE AND WHAT CAN I SAY IT'S AWESOME 
IT'S A MILE FROM THE SEA AND HAS EVERYTHING MAGGIE AND DAVE ASKED FOR 
YES BEGRUDGINGLY WELL DONE CHRISTIAN 
THREE BEDROOMS PLUS A SELF CONTAINED GRANNY FLAT ON THE GROUND FLOOR BUT WILL THEY LIKE IT 
IF WE WERE SET THE CHALLENGE OF INVENTING A CHOCOLATE FIREGUARD OR BEING A DENTIST FOR A CHICKEN 
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A LOT EASIER THAN TRYING TO FIND THE PROPERTY OF YOUR DREAMS WITH ALL YOUR REQUIREMENTS 
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE ENDEAVOURED TO DO OUR BEST AND I THINK WE'VE DONE VERY WELL INDEED 
CERTAINLY I HAVE WITH MY CHOICE PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
IT IS GAME SET AND MATCH BEFORE WE'VE EVEN STARTED WITH THAT HOUSE THERE 
SO WHAT DO WE THINK GO ON INITIAL THOUGHTS 
FROM THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKS QUITE NICE ACTUALLY 
YES WHAT DO WE THINK DAVE YEAH IT TICKS THE BOXES FOR ME AT THE MOMENT 
THERE IS ONE OTHER THING THAT CATCHES MY EYE IN THE STREET AS WELL WHICH I FIND RATHER ALARMING 
THE FIRE STATION AT THE END OF THE ROAD MIGHT BE A TOUCH NOISY WITH THE NEIGHBOURS PERHAPS I'M JUST 
NOW LET ME JUST CLARIFY THEY DON'T PUT THEIR ALARMS ON IN THIS ROAD AT ALL 
IT'S LIKE HAVING AN ORDINARY VEHICLE GO PAST 
SO YOU WOULD NEVER EVEN KNOW THEY'RE THERE UNLESS YOU HAD LITTLE HOUSEFIRE YOURSELF 
AND THEY'D BE ON YOUR DOORSTEP BEFORE YOU CAN SAY 
THAT'S VERY REASSURING YEAH 
NICE TO KNOW AS WELL YEAH BIT OF SECURITY GO ON 
ENJOY IT THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE IT TRYING TO SABOTAGE IT 
I KNOW I THOUGHT I HAD YOU ON A SLIPPERY POLE THEN FOR A SECOND 
RIGHT SIMON POP YOUR HEADPHONES ON SO YOU CAN HEAR LOTS OF PRAISE BEING FESTOONED UPON ME 
WILL THAT FIT OVER YOUR HEAD I DON'T KNOW DEFINITELY NOT MY EGO 
OH YES THAT'S NICE 
I LIKE THE FLOOR NICE AND BIG 
NICE ROOM ACTUALLY PROBABLY LOSE THE CORNICE DID YOU HEAR THAT 
PROBABLY LOSE THE CORNICE 
NO NO I'M GOING TO SORT THEM OUT 
YOU CANNOT TOUCH ORIGINAL FEATURES IN A VICTORIAN HOUSE 
THE CEILING'S WALLPAPERED 
YOU DON'T VERY OFTEN SEE THAT THESE DAYS 
WALLPAPER ON CEILINGS I HAVE TO SAY NOT MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE WHEN IT COMES TO DECORATING COBWEBS 
COBWEBS ALL OVER THE ALCOVE 
OH THAT'S NOTHING A FEATHER DUSTER COULDN'T SORT OUT 
A FEW COBWEBS AND A LICK OF PAINT 
I DO LIKE THE WINDOW ON THE SIDE 
YEAH NICE AND BRIGHT 
THIS IS NICE 
THIS IS VERY PRESENTABLE OH I LIKE THAT 
THAT IS GOOD THAT'S A BIG TABLE 
EIGHT CHAIRS AND THIS ROOM'S GOT PLENTY OF ROOM FOR IT 
IT'S NICE AND AIRY IT IS 
DO YOU WANT TO GIVE ME A LITTLE PAT ON THE BACK BECAUSE IT'S GOING QUITE WELL HERE GO ON 
YES IT IS TWO ROOMS TWO FIREPLACES AND THEY BOTH LOOK GOOD 
THEY BOTH LOOK LIKE THEY'RE USED 
THAT'S MY FAVOURITE FIREPLACE 
THAT BEAUTIFUL ORIGINAL FIREPLACE IN THE DINING ROOM 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS 
NICE BIG WINDOWS 
HIDE DADO 
HIGH DADO STILL THERE IS DADO IN 
SHE'S RELEASING ANOTHER ALBUM I HEAR 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DOING AWAY WITH CARPETS YEAH 
I HOPE YOUR PROPERTY HAS GOT STRIPPED WOODEN FLOORS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE A WINNER IN MY CHOICE 
WE SHALL SEE WE SHALL SEE YEAH 
LOW MAINTENANCE GARDEN FOR YOU 
OH YES NO LAWNMOWERS FOR YOU 
MAGGIE'S QUITE RIGHT THERE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE CALL A LOW MAINTENANCE GARDEN 
SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT A BACKYARD BUT LOW MAINTENANCE GARDEN WORKS 
THIS IS NICE YEAH 
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE COLOUR BUT IT'S NICE 
YEAH AGAIN WOODEN FLOORING 
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS THAT WE'D LIKE IN THE KITCHEN 
DISHWASHER AND A BREAKFAST BAR 
QUESTION WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO PUT A TABLE AND CHAIR IN THERE 
WHEN YOU'VE JUST SEEN THE MOST GARGANTUAN DINING ROOM 
BECAUSE IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED BREAKFAST ROOMS ARE VERY DE RIGEUR 
OH REALLY IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'D BE WORRIED ABOUT CHANGING TOO QUICKLY AS SOON AS YOU MOVE IN NO 
WHICH IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT REALLY I WOULD PUT CUPBOARDS 
YEAH WE NEED MORE CUPBOARD AND STORAGE SPACE 
YEAH OH NEED MORE STORAGE SPACE 
OH I FEEL US GOING DOWNHILL 
NO IT'S NOT IT'S A MINUTE DETAIL IN THE VERY GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS 
IS THIS SOME KIND OF A CONNECTING 
DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
NOW ARE THEY GOING TO TWIG THAT THEY'RE NOW ENTERING THE ANNEX TO THE PROPERTY 
I LIKE THAT PRETTY MUCH A BASIC REQUIREMENT THESE DAYS 
PEOPLE LIKE SHOWERS AS WELL AS BATHS IT'S A NICE COLOUR AS WELL 
IT IS THIS IS GOOD NOT BAD 
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO REALISE THEY'VE NOW ENTERED THE ANNEX WHICH WILL BE FOR MOTHER 
AH THAT'S NICE 
I SEE THIS AND I THINK YOUR MOTHER 
OH THEY JUST HAVE IDEAL ISN'T IT 
YEAH I THINK SHE'D BE QUITE HAPPY WITH THIS I THINK SHE WOULD 
WE'VE GOT TO GET IT RIGHT OTHERWISE WE'LL NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT 
GIVES HER UM 
THE INDEPENDENCE THAT SHE'S TOLD US SHE WANTS YEAH 
SO WE WOULDN'T BE UNDER EACH OTHER'S FEET ALL THE TIME 
THEY'VE DONE GOOD HERE DOWNSTAIRS I LIKE 
YEAH DOWNSTAIRS IS GOOD DOWNSTAIRS IS GOOD 
DOWNSTAIRS IS GOOD DOWNSTAIRS IS GOOD DOWNSTAIRS IS GOOD 
THE ONLY THING I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE PROPORTIONS OF THIS HOUSE IS WHETHER 
ONCE THEY'VE FINISHED THE TOUR YOUR HEAD WILL FIT IN ANY OF THE ROOMS 
ONE OR TWO COBWEBS AGAIN 
WHAT'S THIS ONE OF THE SMALLER BEDROOMS 
THE SECOND OR THIRD BEDROOM YEAH 
THE CEILING'S A BIT DOWDY 
OH SIMON HE'S DESCRIBING THAT CEILING AS SOMEONE WOULD DESCRIBE YOUR DRESS SENSE SLIGHTLY DOWDY 
VERY LIGHT VERY AIRY 
COULD ALWAYS MAKE IT INTO UM 
A STUDY THIS ONE IF IT'S ONE OF THE SMALLER ONES YEAH 
I THINK IT'S MORE THAN GENEROUS 
YES BUT THIS QUITE OFTEN HAPPENS WITH A HOUSE WHERE THEY'VE HAD AN EXTENSION ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
IT UNBALANCES THE HOUSE 
WHEN YOU GO UPSTAIRS YOU EXPECT THE SAME GRANDEUR AND IT TAKES A WHILE TO ADJUST YEAH IT'S BOTTOM HEAVY 
THE DECOR IN THIS ONE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'D WANT TO DO FAIRLY QUICKLY 
FAIRLY QUICKLY YES 
I THINK IT'S ONLY THE DECOR REALLY 
YEAH THE SIZE IS O. K. A NICE BIG BAY WINDOW AGAIN 
LET'S CHECK THE NEXT ONE LET'S CHECK THE NEXT ONE OH 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE 
A SHOWER CUBICLE 
SO NO BATH LIKE OURS 
YEAH 
WE'RE USED TO BEING BATHLESS YEAH 
ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS OURS 
THE LOO AND THE SHOWER ARE SEPARATE WHICH IS NICE 
YEAH I CAN IMAGINE THAT MIGHT COME IN HANDY 
HANG ON THIS COULD BE THE MAIN BEDROOM AH HA 
YEAH THIS HAS GOT TO BE IT 
THAT'S NICE 
AH EN SUITE 
OOH NEVER HAD AN EN SUITE HAVE WE NO 
IT'S A NICE SIZE 
I SAY THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR SHOWER UP HERE AS WELL THAT'S A WHOPPER 
IT'S A HUGE A HUGE BATHROOM AND BEDROOM ALL OF IT'S BIG 
IN TERMS OF DECOR THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ONES 
BETTER ROOMS YEAH I QUITE LIKE THIS ONE 
RIGHT LET'S GET IN THERE BEFORE HE DOES ANY DAMAGE TO THAT CORNICE 
DID I HEAR WHEN I HAD THOSE HEADPHONES ON THAT YOU SAID YOU WOULD REMOVE THE CORNICE 
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE CEILING ROSE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT 
NOW WITH A PERIOD HOUSE LIKE THIS WHAT REALLY ADDS VALUE TO IT ARE ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES 
THAT IS UNQUESTIONABLY AN ORIGINAL CEILING ROSE AGREED 
PERHAPS YOU WERE THINKING IT LOOKS A BIT UNTIDY NEEDS A BIT OF WORK 
YEAH WHAT YOU CAN DO THESE DAYS IS GET A POULTICE IT'S LIKE A BANDAGE THAT YOU PUT ON IT 
YOU LEAVE IT TO SET YOU PEEL IT OFF AND IT WILL TAKE IT BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL BEAUTY 
IT'S AN AMAZING PROCESS 
THEN ALL A SUDDEN YOU'D BE THINKING WHAT WAS I THINKING OF GETTING RID OF THAT 
I CAN SEE THAT ALL RIGHT GOOD LAD 
THANK HEAVENS FOR THAT LET'S FIND THE OTHERS 
MAGGIE BOUND OUT HERE INTO WHAT IS OR WOULD BE OR COULD BE YOUR GARDEN 
LOVE YOU FOR LOVING THE HOUSE 
THAT WAS SUPERB IT'S NICE 
COME UP HERE AND LET ME MAKE YOU LOVE IT EVEN MORE STAND THERE 
TURN YOURSELF AROUND AND LOOK AT THE SCALE OF THIS 
IT'S BIG IT'S HUGE IT LOOKS MUCH BIGGER FROM BACK HERE THAN IT DOES AT THE FRONT DOESN'T IT 
IT DOES THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO SEPARATE PROPERTIES HERE 
YOU'VE GOT THE HOUSE THAT YOU WOULD LIVE IN AND OF COURSE THE HOUSE HERE FOR MUM 
KEEPING YOUR INDEPENDENCE BUT BEING CLOSE ENOUGH TO YOU TO BE LOVED AND CARED FOR 
YEAH WHERE AM I GOING TO LIVE THAT'S THE QUESTION 
SO WE'RE GOT TO TALK ABOUT MONEY AND PRICES AND GUESS THE PRICE 
HELLO BOYS GRABBING HER HAND 
I SAW THAT NERVOUSLY 
RIGHT WHO'S GOING TO GO FIRST 
I THINK LADIES FIRST 
GO ON MAGGIE 
UM ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
DAVE YOU'RE LOOKING PENSIVE 
I'D SAY THIS IS A REALLY NICE HOUSE 
IT'S GOT BAGS OF CHARACTER CORRECT 
I'D SAY CLOSER TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY REALLY 
DAVE YOU ARE CLOSEST TO THE PRICE BUT UNFORTUNATELY YOU'RE BOTH QUITE A LONG WAY OUT 
THE ACTUAL PRICE IS ACTUALLY TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
IT'S O. K. IT'S ALL RIGHT I'VE GOT YOU 
HOLD ON WE NEED TO TALK HERE 
FIRST UP THE OWNER SAYS HE'S WILLING TO TAKE OFFERS 
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR IN LIFE AND IF YOU WANT QUALITY YOU GET ME AND HOUSES LIKE THIS 
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET SO WE'RE NOT TOO DOWNHEARTED NO 
NOT TOO DOWNHEARTED WE'LL BE ABSOLUTELY COCK A HOOP WHEN WE LOOK AT MY PROPERTY 
COME ON LET'S GO OH MY GOODNESS 
THAT SOUNDS A BIT SCARY 
PROPERTY ONE HAS THE GRANNY FLAT THEY WANTED BUT AS IT'S ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
THEY'LL NEED TO MAKE SURE THE DOORS AND WINDOWS ARE SECURE FOR JEAN'S PEACE OF MIND 
EVEN THOUGH IT IS ABOVE THEIR BUDGET MAGGIE AND DAVE SHOULDN'T LET IT PUT THEM OFF 
IT'S OFTEN POSSIBLE TO NEGOTIATE A LOWER PRICE WITH A VENDOR 
SO IT COULD PAY TO HAGGLE 
GIVEN HOW FEW PLACES WITH ANNEXES THERE WERE IN WESTON 
CRAFTY ME THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO LOOK AT PROPERTIES WITH POSSIBILITIES TO EXTEND 
BINGO PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
YES A RECENT BUILD IN A QUIET SPOT 
BUT HOW WILL IT GO DOWN WITH OUR DISCERNING BUYERS 
AS WE APPROACH MY CHOICE OF PROPERTY YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE WALKING ON THE ROAD 
THERE'S NO CHANCE OF BEING KNOCKED DOWN BY THE EMERGENCY SERVICES DOING NINETY M. P. H. 
IT IS A CONTRAST TO CHRISTIAN'S 
AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S A VERY MODERN PROPERTY THAT'S WHAT I'VE SERVED UP TO YOU 
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE SMASH THIS ONE DAVE 
WE'RE A COUPLE OF MILES INLAND FIRST IMPRESSIONS PLEASE 
VERY NICE 
DEFINITELY GAME SET AND MATCH I THINK OH 
CHRISTIAN START SWEATING 
THE EFFORT SHOULD BE REWARDED HERE 
LOADS OF SPACE AND POTENTIAL INSIDE THIS PROPERTY 
YOU'VE GOT TO GO IN THERE AND SEE IF YOU FALL IN LOVE COME ON LET'S SEE IF YOU SHOUT LOVE 
OFF YOU GO LOVE 
LOOK AT YOU AGAIN TRYING TO SABOTAGE MY CHOICE WHEN IT'S EVEN YOUR PROPERTY 
WELL THERE YOU GO 
MY REPUTATION IS ON THE LINE JUDGE ME BY THIS PROPERTY 
YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS 
THIS IS NICE AND BIG 
GO LEFT FIRST 
THEY'RE GOING LEFT FIRST IMMEDIATE SURPRISE ON THE WAY 
IT IS THIS ISN'T CONVENTIONAL LAYOUT NO I'M WARNING YOU 
LIGHT AND AIRY

I THOUGHT THEY'D BE MORE SURPRISED ABOUT STUMBLING ACROSS THAT BEDROOM BUT NO 
THEY'RE NOT SURPRISED BECAUSE THEY JUST KNOW THAT I LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID 
REALLY COSY 
EXCELLENT DECOR 
OH OH THIS IS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT ISN'T IT 
OH A WALK IN WARDROBE YEAH 
SOUNDS GOOD GOOD IDEA 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT THROUGH HERE THIS IS NICE 
THEY'RE HAPPY WITH THE DECOR HAPPY WITH THE SPACIOUS LIGHT FEELING 
ANOTHER EN SUITE 
AND THE EN SUITE 
SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T GOT AT THE MOMENT THAT'S NICE 
NOW IT'S A NICE EN SUITE NOT AS LARGE AS THE EN SUITE I'VE GIVEN THEM BUT IT IS A NICE ONE 
THAT'S REALLY COOL THAT'S LOVELY THAT IS SO COOL 
I DO LIKE THAT 
NICE AND BIG YEAH 
THEIR EN SUITE CONTAINS MY FAVOURITE ELEMENT TO THIS PROPERTY WHICH IS THE FIBRE OPTIC CEILING 
IT GLISTENS AWAY LIKE THOUSANDS OF STARS I LIKE THAT A LOT 
YOU ARE JUST SO SHOWBIZ AREN'T YOU 
NO DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT 
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT SAFETY RAILS IN FOR HER 
YEAH EXCUSE ME BIG ENOUGH TO PUT SAFETY RAILS IN 
I CAN SEE THEY'RE ALREADY PLANNING THEIR MOVE 
THIS IS QUITE A BIG ROOM AS WELL 
YEAH 
IT'S GOOD GOOD YEAH 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN HERE THIS WILL BE THE MAIN LOUNGE MAIN LOUNGE YEAH 
THIS IS A NICE SIZE YES THAT'S NICE 
NICE SIZE IT'S NICE 
THEY COULD BE MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT THINGS COULDN'T THEY 
THEY COULD THEY COULD BUT THE BASIC THING IS JUST TRYING NOT TO GO OVER THE TOP ON THIS ONE 
TO REALLY DISAPPOINT YOU TOO MUCH BAY WINDOW AS WELL 
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T GOT AT THE MOMENT A BAY WINDOW WHICH LOOKS OUT TO THE FRONT OF THE GARDEN 
THAT'S NICE YEAH NICE BAY WINDOW THERE 
I KNOW YOUR PROPERTY ALSO HAD A BAY WINDOW SO SHALL WE CALL THAT DEUCE 
I'D LOVE A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE NO IT DOESN'T MATTER 
DINING ROOM 
EVEN THAT'S A GOOD SIZE 
I DON'T KNOW IF OUR TABLE WOULD GO IN THERE 
THEY COULD GET THEIR DINING TABLE IN THAT DINING ROOM IN YOUR PROPERTY IF THEY CUT THEIR DINING TABLE IN HALF 
THIS IS NICE DAVE 
I LIKE THIS THIS IS NICE 
IT'S GOT CLASS 
THIS IS REALLY CLASSY 
CLASSY I BELIEVE IS THE WORD BEING USED NOW 
CLASSY THAT'S WHAT I CALL DECOR CLASSY 
IT'S FRESH IT'S NEUTRAL IT'S CLEAN BUT IT'S NOT CLASSY 
ROOM FOR A DISHWASHER I'M ALL RIGHT 
OVEN THERE AND THE COOKER OVER THERE 
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING COS THEY'RE HOUSE HUNTING NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES 
BUT THEY'RE SECOND GUESSING WHAT MUM WANTS AS WELL WHICH IS AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC 
I LIKE THE HANDRAILS ON THE SIDE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S GETTING SO EXCITED ABOUT A HANDRAIL 
I MEAN GET A GRIP 
THIS WOULD BE BEDROOM ONE I PRESUME 
I SUPPOSE 
ROOM FOR A DOUBLE BED 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR STORAGE YEAH 
THAT'S A NICE WAY TO CONCEAL STORAGE SPACE WITH A CURTAIN LIKE THAT 
DIFFERENT 
BATHROOM 
OH THAT'S DIFFERENT 
I LIKE THE TOILET SEAT 
OH YEAH 
THAT'S A FEATURE THAT YOU DON'T SEE VERY OFTEN 
THAT IS A VERY CURIOUS LAVATORY SEAT BECAUSE IT'S IN THE FORMATION OF A DENIM BOTTOM 
DOES THAT DO MUCH FOR YOU 
NO NO IT'S JUST NOT IN MY GENES REALLY I'M BEING NOSY 
OH THE AIRING CUPBOARD BOILER 
THIS WILL BE PROBABLY THE SMALLEST OF THE BEDROOMS I'D SAY 
IT'S EXTREMELY COSY 
THAT LITTLE ROOM IS GOOD OFFICE SPACE AS IT'S PRESENTED YES 
LAST BEDROOM 
YEAH THIS MUST BE THE MASTER 
OH I DON'T KNOW THOUGH 
I DON'T THINK WE'D HAVE ANY ISSUES OVER THE SIZE OF THE BEDROOMS 
NO NOT REALLY 
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ONE MASTER BEDROOM BIGGER THAN THE OTHER TWO 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM SOMEHOW 
KERCHING YOU'VE GOT YOUR VIEWS OUT THERE AS WELL YEAH 
IS THAT THE MENDIPS MENDIPS I THINK YEAH 
THAT'S A LOVELY VIEW 
THIS IS JUST GOING ALL TOO WELL ISN'T IT FOR YOU 
THEY'RE LOOKING ACROSS AT THE LOVELY VIEW TO THE MENDIPS 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE HOUSES WHERE YOU JUST WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY AS SOON AS YOU'VE MOVED IN 
WHAT GOES IN YOUR FAVOUR IS THAT DAVE DOESN'T LIKE DIY 
IN THIS HOUSE THERE'S NOT ONE THING THAT NEEDS SCREWING OR PLUGGING OR SAWING OR HAMMERING EXACTLY 
THE DECOR'S GOOD ISN'T IT EXCELLENT 
O. K. THERE IS NO DENYING THAT THEY DO LIKE YOUR PROPERTY 
IT'S TIME TO GO IN THERE LIKE A LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER 
DAVE YOU AND MAGGIE ARE SMITTEN ON THAT HOUSE ALREADY 
SO I'M TAKING YOU AWAY FROM THE HOUSE 
THERE'S THE HOUSE OUT HERE WE BOUNCE HERE AND LOOK WHAT IS ON YOUR DOORSTEP 
IT'S QUITE UNBELIEVABLE IT'S LOVELY ISN'T IT 
IT'S QUITE LOVELY IT'S FANTASTIC 
GLORIOUS ROLLING COUNTRYSIDE AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE 
NOW IF YOU WERE TO FOLLOW THIS RIVER THAT WAY AND GO FOR A NICE FORTY FIVE MINUTE WALK ARE YOU INTO YOUR WALKING 
YES DEFINITELY YOU WOULD END UP BY THE SEASIDE 
SO BEACH A WALK THAT WAY OR IF YOU GO THAT WAY 
GO ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE 
YOU'LL SEE SOME REALLY ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITE VILLAGES WHERE 
I'M NOT PIGEONHOLING YOU BUT THERE ARE SOME PUBS O. K. 
BUT IT HELPS ON THE WAY DOESN'T IT 
WHICH DIRECTION WOULD YOU BE TRAVELLING IN SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT WAY 
I HAD A FUNNY FEELING ABOUT THAT 
HOW ABOUT WE JOG BACK AND DO GUESS THE PRICE 
MAGGIE IT FEELS TO ME LIKE YOU REALLY LIKE THIS PROPERTY 
YES I DO 
YOU'VE GOT THAT LOVELY DOUBLE BEDROOM 
WITH THE EN SUITE DOWNSTAIRS WHICH WOULD DO WELL FOR JEAN 
BUT WE ALSO HAVE THIS RATHER LARGE STRUCTURE BACK HERE WHICH AT THE MOMENT IS A UTILITY ROOM 
IT WAS ORIGINALLY THE GARAGE FOR THE HOUSE 
WHEN THE HOUSE WAS EXTENDED IT GOT MADE REDUNDANT 
SO WHAT IT IS NOW IS A RATHER GLORIOUS GARDEN SHED ISN'T IT 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY USE A LOT OF THESE MATERIALS AND BRING IT ROUND TO THIS SPACE HERE 
AND EXTEND JEAN'S FLAT SO SHE HAS HER LIVING SPACE AS WELL 
BY USING THE MATERIALS WHICH FIT PERFECTLY YOU WOULDN'T HALF REDUCE THE COST 
THERE ARE OPTIONS HERE AREN'T THERE 
THERE ARE YOU COULD EXTEND OUT SIDEWAYS IT WOULD MONEY BUT 
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT PRICE YET THAT'S WHERE WE WERE UP TO 
WE MADE IT BACK IN THE NICK OF TIME WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN 
WE'VE BEEN OFF GALLIVANTING WE HAVE ALL VERY SECRET FAIR ENOUGH 
RIGHT GUESS THE PRICE FOR THE SECOND TIME 
DAVE YOU GOT THE LAST ONE RIGHT SO COME ON MADAM YOU'VE GOT TO SORT YOURSELF OUT I KNOW 
MAGGIE WENT FIRST LAST TIME 
O. K. WE'LL EVEN IT OUT DAVE HOW MUCH FOR THIS LOVELY PROPERTY 
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT ON THE MONEY 
I'D SAY TOP OF OUR BUDGET TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IT'S GOT A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND IT'S AN EXCELLENT LOCATION 
MAGGIE YEAH 
I'M GOING TO GO JUST OVER THAT TWO HUNDRED FIVE

IS THAT ALL 
WOW 
IT'S AMAZING SHALL WE TURN ROUND AND HUG IT NOW 
GIVE IT A LITTLE OOH LOVE THE BRICKS OH 
CAN I HEAR REMOVAL VANS 
I'M SURE I CAN IN THE DISTANCE YOU KNOW 
IT'S MY QUIET AGONY YOU CAN HEAR 
SO IT'S EVIDENT THAT YOU LIKE THIS PROPERTY 
WE'VE SHOWN YOU A NICE PERIOD PROPERTY WE'VE SHOWN YOU THIS NEW BUILD 
PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE WILD CARD LIES AWAITING 
AWAY WE GO 
IF PROPERTY TWO IS THE ONE THAT MAGGIE AND DAVE GO FOR 
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO THINGS THEY WILL NEED TO CONSIDER 
THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY THE CURRENT OWNER 
SO IT WOULD BE WORTH GETTING IT CHECKED OUT BY A QUALIFIED SURVEYOR 
TO ENSURE IT'S AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS 
WHILE TURNING AN INTEGRAL GARAGE INTO A LIVING SPACE DOES NOT NORMALLY REQUIRE PLANNING PERMISSION 
CONVERTING A DETACHED GARAGE MAY BE A BIT TRICKY 
SO CHECK WITH YOUR LOCAL PLANNING DEPARTMENT 
OUR WILD CARD IS A FABULOUS VICTORIAN TOWN HOUSE 
ON THREE FLOORS WITH ABSOLUTELY HUMONGOUSLY MASSIVE ROOMS 
AND IT'S ONLY A STONE'S THROW FROM THE BEACH 
IT'S GOT FOUR BEDROOMS AND THE KITCHEN WELL IT NEVER ENDS 
IT CURRENTLY LACKS A GRANNY FLAT BUT THAT'S A MERE DETAIL AND NOTHING THAT WE CAN'T CHANGE 
O. K. DAVE AND MAGGIE HERE WE FINALLY ARE AT THE WILD CARD 
IT'S A JOINT CHOICE BETWEEN MYSELF AND SIMON WE FINALLY AGREED ON SOMETHING DIDN'T WE 
IT'S A RARITY BUT DID HAPPEN 
JUST TO CLARIFY THE PROPERTY YOU SEE BEFORE YOU WHICH IS THE WILD CARD 
YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOURSELF 
IN A MILLION YEARS 
YOU WILL SEE WHY 
ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY IS THE INTERIOR IS VERY INTERESTING 
AND THROWS UP ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING POSSIBILITIES 
FURTHERMORE THE REASON I WAS SO KEEN ON THIS PLACE 
IS BECAUSE WE DO LIKE TO BE BESIDE THE SEASIDE 
BESIDE THE SEASIDE BESIDE THE SEA IT'S TWO MINUTES AWAY 
YOU CAN SEE IT AT THE END OF THE STREET THERE 
THIS EDWARDIAN PROPERTY IS SITUATED EXACTLY WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE IN WESTON SUPER MARE 
WHY DON'T YOU GO INSIDE AND EXPLORE GO ON 
WHAT A PAIR OF LOVELY DEARS AREN'T THEY THEY CERTAINLY ARE YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN IN A SECOND 
HEADPHONES ON AND UMBRELLAS BECAUSE OF A LIGHT DRIZZLE 
YES INDEED HOW QUICK THE WEATHER CAN CHANGE 
FIRST RECEPTION ROOM 
THIS IS NICE 
THEY'RE USING THEIR FAVOURITE ADJECTIVE NICE 
IT'S AMAZING THESE OLDER HOUSES AND THE HIGH CEILINGS AND HOW MUCH MORE SPACIOUS IT FEELS 
IT'S TRUE CORRECT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD 
SPACIOUS IS THE RIGHT WORD 
LOVELY CEILING ROSE VERY ORNATE 
I'LL BE HAVING A WORD WITH HIM ABOUT THAT 
HE'S CHANGED HIS TUNE SOMEWHAT HASN'T HE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MY WORK HERE IS DONE 
YES IT'S GOT A LOT OF ATTRACTIVE FEATURES THIS ROOM 
SAME CARPETS THROUGHOUT 
WOW I WASN'T EXPECTING ANYBODY TO PRAISE THE CARPET 
BUT MAGGIE'S GONE STRAIGHT IN THERE AND IS IN LOVE WITH THAT REPEATING PATTERN YEP 
IT'S JUST AS BIG AS THE FIRST 
WATCH BEHIND YOU OH SORRY MATE 
WE'VE GOT VISITORS THAT IS WHY I THINK THIS IS THE WILD CARD 
THERE YOU'VE GOT BEASTS ON THE WALL 
WHEN I FIRST WALKED IN I LOOKED UP AND WENT OH DEER I LOOKED AT THE OTHER AND WENT OH DEER OH DEER 
I LIKE THE HEIGHT THEY'VE MADE THIS VERY HOMELY HAVEN'T THEY 
ROOM FOR A TABLE AND CHAIRS 
FIREPLACE AGAIN I WISH MAGGIE WOULD STOP LISTING AND SAY 
HOW SHE FELT ABOUT THE FIREPLACE THE CEILING ROSE 
CAN I SAY HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE FIREPLACES HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THEM THEY DON'T FIT 
I AGREE 
I TELL YOU WHAT THOSE POOR BEASTS MUST HAVE 
BEEN RUNNING AT SOME SPEED TO HIT THAT WALL LIKE THAT MUSTN'T THEY 
I WONDER IF THE NEIGHBOURS HAVE GOT THE REST OF THEM 
NICE WIDE CORRIDOR AGAIN 
MM 
I'LL BE NOSEY 
I DO LIKE THE CARPETING 
WILL THEY SPOT THE POTENTIAL BACK HERE 
FOR THE FLAT FOR JEAN YEAH 
WATCH YOUR STEP OH THAT'S A BIG ONE 
THAT'S A BIG BIG KITCHEN 
THAT REALLY IS BIG ISN'T IT 
THAT IS THAT IS HUGE 
I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST ONE WE'VE SEEN TODAY 
THAT IS THE LARGEST KITCHEN WE'RE SHOWING THEM 
EVEN THOUGH THIS PROPERTY LOOKS SIMILAR TO OUR FIRST ONE 
ON THE OUTSIDE IT DOES FEEL A BIT GRANDER AND MORE SPACIOUS INSIDE 
ALL THE PROPORTIONS ARE SLIGHTLY BIGGER DO YOU THINK I DO 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT THROUGH HERE BIG WINDOWS UTILITY 
OH YEAH VERY PRACTICAL PLENTY OF SPACE PLENTY OF ROOM 
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS VERY CONFUSING FOR THEM 
BECAUSE THERE'S A SERIES OF ROOMS THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A SENSIBLE USE 
THEY NEED TO REALLY PLAN THIS AS THEY GO 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN HERE 
DOWNSTAIRS YEAH 
IT ALL JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT AS YOU WALK THROUGH HERE 
NO GREAT BIG FAULT OF THE HOUSE 
IT CAN EASILY BE RECTIFIED BUT IT NEEDS REPLANNING 
IT DOES IT JUST NEEDS A BIT OF THOUGHT PUTTING INTO IT THIS IS 
NICE AND WIDE 
IT IS I THINK THIS MIGHT HAVE POSSIBILITIES FOR YOUR MUM 
AH DAVE IS ONTO US GOOD LAD 
TOP STUFF ABSOLUTELY 
IT'S GOT POTENTIAL IT'S NOT THERE NOW BUT IT'S GOT POTENTIAL 
YOU'D HAVE TO LOSE THE UTILITY 
YEAH BUT IT'S GOT POTENTIAL 
DO YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE WINNING THEM OVER I'M IMPRESSED 
I DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD FIGURE THIS SPACE OUT AS QUICKLY AS THEY HAVE 
BUT THEY HAVE STRAIGHT ONTO IT 
USE THE UTILITY AND KNOCK IT THROUGH 
YEAH 
NICE CARPET AGAIN 
STURDY BANNISTERS 
I DO LIKE BURGUNDY IT'S A FAVOURITE COLOUR OF MINE 
THIS IS NICE 
LOOK AT THIS 
ISN'T THAT BIG DOESN'T THAT LOOK LOVELY AND COSY 
NICE LITTLE WINDOW THERE 
THAT ROOM LET'S FACE IT IT'S A LOVE NEST 
THAT IS BIG 
THAT'S NICE SIDE WINDOW 
IT'S GOT A BATH AS WELL 
THAT'S QUITE TASTEFULLY DONE OUT 
IT'S QUITE MODERN ISN'T IT TASTEFULLY DONE 
TASTEFULLY DONE QUITE MODERN THIS IS WHY I THINK THEY'RE STILL GOING TO GO BACK TO PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
THEY'RE MUCH WARMER ABOUT THIS PROPERTY THAN THEY WERE WITH YOUR CHOICE NO NO 
BUT HAVING SAID THAT I JUST KNOW THEY HAVE THE FEEL FOR THE MODERN 
REALLY GO ROUND AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE 
BUILT TO LAST WEREN'T THEY PROBABLY THE ORIGINAL 
OOH LOOK AT THIS ONE 
OH I'VE NOT HEARD MAGGIE GET THAT EXCITED OOH LOOK AT THAT ONE 
I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE KETTLE ON THE BOIL FOR A MOMENT 
I LIKE THE WALLPAPER THAT'S LOVELY 
YEAH QUITE ROOMY AND SPACIOUS 
IT'S INTERESTING THERE'S A FEW DECOR FEATURES IN THIS PROPERTY SHE LIKES CARPETS AND WALLPAPERS 
NOT MY BAG BUT IF SHE'S HAPPY THEN WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING HER ALL THE WAY 
THE WARDROBE IS IN KEEPING WITH THE HOUSE REALLY 
WE COULD ALWAYS GET FITTED ONES PUT IN THERE 
I THINK THAT WOULD SPOIL IT A BIT YOU DO 
OH 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WITH DAVE YEAH 
I DON'T THINK I WOULD GO FOR FITTED WARDROBES IN A HOUSE OF THIS AGE 
ALL THE ROOMS ARE BIG WE HAVEN'T COME ACROSS A SMALL BEDROOM YET THEY'VE ALL GOT BIG WINDOWS 
WHICH IS NICE YEAH BUT NOT ONE SMALL BEDROOM YET IS THERE NO 
YOU COULD ALWAYS HAVE TWO WARDROBES ONE EACH SIDE 
I KNOW THE DECOR IS ONLY SUPERFICIAL 
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO WORRY ABOUT DOING ANYTHING WHEN YOU FIRST MOVE IN 
I THINK DAVE'S A LITTLE BIT IDLE 
IDLE 
I HAD A TOUCH OF THE MARY POPPINS THERE NEARLY WENT OFF TO GO AND HELP SOME CHILDREN 
LAST BEDROOM YEAH 
OH SINGLE ONE 
STUDY 
STUDY COMPUTER ROOM 
I THINK THIS HOUSE HAS GOT A LOT OF POSITIVES A LOT OF THINGS GOING FOR IT IT'S NICE 
RIGHT THAT'S THAT YEP 
I THINK THEY'RE INTERESTED LET'S SEE IF THIS ONE IS MATCH POINT 
DAVE AS YOU WALKED ROUND THIS HOUSE IT BECAME APPARENT 
THAT YOU REALLY STARTED TO GET A FEEL FOR THE CHARACTER OF THE PLACE YEAH 
WHY WAS THAT 
I SENSED THE HOUSE MUST BE ROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE RETAINED A LOT OF ITS STYLE 
YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT 
THIS HOUSE HAS NEVER BEEN MODERNISED GUTTED AND MODERNISED 
LIKE SO MANY OF THESE BEAUTIFUL OLD PLACES COME HERE 
BEHIND THE CURTAINS 
STILL HERE TUCKED AWAY IN HERE ARE THE ORIGINAL BOX SHUTTERS 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF PAINT HAVE HIDDEN THEM AWAY BUT YOU COULD FREE THEM UP 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT BEHIND HERE THIS WOULD ALL CONCERTINA OUT AND COVER THIS WHOLE WINDOW THE WHOLE WINDOW 
TWO FROM THIS SIDE AND TWO FROM THE OTHER SIDE 
I'VE CHECKED THEY'RE ALL THERE 
THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE THIS PROPERTY 
MAGGIE MY DEAREST LISTEN TO THAT RAIN GOING ON HORRIBLE 
BUT WE'RE SNUG IN HERE YOU WERE VERY ASTUTE BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU CAME DOWN HERE 
YOU REALISED THERE WAS NO ANNEXE AS SUCH FOR MUM YES 
THAT CAN'T CONTINUE WE NEED TO SORT THAT OUT IN HERE WE HAVE A LOO AND A SINK 
PLUMBING'S ALREADY THERE FOR AN EN SUITE 
A LOT OF REBUILDING BUT OPEN THIS SPACE OUT TAKE THESE WALLS AWAY 
INTO HERE WE'RE GIVING YOU A BEDROOM WITH AN EN SUITE 
THIS WOULD BE JUST A LITTLE SITTING SPACE A LITTLE BIT OF PRIVATE LOUNGE 
NOT HUGE BUT ENOUGH ENOUGH YEAH 
THEN OF COURSE WE ENTER INTO HERE AND WE HAVE THE VERY VERY LARGE KITCHEN 
THE LARGEST ONE WE'VE SEEN OUT OF ALL THREE PROPERTIES IT'S VERY NICE 
HERE WHAT WE'LL DO WITH THIS WINDOW IS OPEN THAT OUT SO YOU HAVE PRIVATE ACCESS 
OUT INTO THE GARDEN AND COURTYARD WITHOUT DISTURBING MOTHER RIGHT YEAH YEAH 
SHE IS SELF SUFFICIENT THERE AND SHE'D COME IN HERE AND HELP HERSELF TO A SLICE OF BATTENBURG 
WHENEVER SHE LIKES FAIR ENOUGH YEP 
IF MAGGIE AND DAVE WENT FOR THIS PROPERTY AND DECIDE 
TO BUILD ONTO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE THEY'D NEED TO 
IF IT IS REGULATIONS ARE MUCH STRICTER AND THE PERMISSION TAKES LONGER TO OBTAIN 
IT'S GOING TO COST MONEY YEAH SO IT ALL DEPENDS REALLY ON HOW MUCH THIS PROPERTY IS ON THE MARKET FOR 
OH WE'RE JOINED BY THE RABBLE 
THE RABBLE THAT'S NOT VERY NICE IS IT GUESS THE PRICE TIME THIRD AND FINAL ABSOLUTELY 
WHO'S GOING TO GO FIRST 
MAGGIE'S TWO DOWN COME ON 
I AM COME ON MAGGIE SORT IT OUT 
I'M GOING TO GO FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
YEAH DAVE 
I'D SAY TWO HUNDRED FIVE TWO HUNDRED FIVE 
YOU'VE UNDERCUT MAGGIE 
AND I HAVE TO SAY MAGGIE YOU ARE AN ULTIMATE LOSER 
EVERY PROPERTY YOU'VE LOST 
YOU SIR A HAT TRICK BECAUSE THIS PROPERTY IS ON THE MARKET FOR FIFTY QUID SHY OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
A LOT OF HOUSE FOR NOT A LOT OF MONEY AND A LOT OF STYLE 
A LOT OF STYLE IF ONLY WE COULD SAY THE SAME FOR SIMON 
MORE SERIOUSLY WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT 
WHICH PROPERTY YOU'D LIKE TO TEST DRIVE TRY BEFORE YOU BUY 
ABSOLUTELY SO BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR MINDS UP TAKE AWAY THIS LAPTOP 
AND HAVE A LOOK AT ALL THE IMAGES WE'VE DOWNLOADED FROM ALL THREE PROPERTIES TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORIES 
GO ON OFF YOU GO IT'S A BIG DECISION TO TEST DRIVE A LOT RIDING ON IT 
INDEED WHILE THEY MAKE THAT MOMENTOUS DECISION 
HERE'S A QUICK REMINDER FOR YOU LOT AT HOME 
AS I'M SURE YOU'LL RECALL PROPERTY NUMBER ONE FITS THE BILL NICELY 
FOUR BEDROOMS AND A SELF CONTAINED GRANNY FLAT MUST MAKE THIS PROPERTY THE FRONT RUNNER 
IT'S IN A DESIRABLE PART OF WESTON AND COULD BE MAGGIE AND DAVE'S FOR 
OUCH HOW MUCH HOW ABOUT MY CHOICE 
PROPERTY TWO IS MODERN IN A NICE QUIET SIDE ROAD AND HAS PLENTY OF SCOPE FOR EXTENDING 
BEST OF ALL IT'S TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNDER MAGGIE AND DAVE'S BUDGET 
WHAT ABOUT OUR WILD CARD WILL THAT TAKE THE HONOURS 
IT'S CLOSE TO THE BEACH WITH PLENTY OF SPACE DOWNSTAIRS FOR THAT GRANNY FLAT 
A STUNNING PERIOD HOME WITH A PRICE TAG OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
MAGGIE AND DAVE ARE GIVING CONSIDERATION TO WHICH PROPERTY THEY WOULD LIKE TO TEST DRIVE 
LET'S FACE IT ALL THREE ARE TEMPTING BUT THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE 
THAT WILL BE PROPERTY TWO YOU WISH 
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GO FOR THE WILD CARD 
IT'S GOING TO BE PROPERTY TWO PROPERTY TWO 
IF YOU'RE BEING SENSIBLE ABOUT THIS IT'S GOT TO BE WILD CARD BECAUSE OF THE SPACE THE POTENTIAL 
YOU'RE RIGHT POSSIBLY IT WILL BE PROPERTY TWO 
WILD CARD ANYWAY I CAN NO LONGER BEAR THE SUSPENSE 
SHALL WE FIND OUT THAT IT'S PROPERTY TWO 
AND I CAN'T BEAR THE REPETITION LET'S DO IT COME ON 
DAVE CLOSE THE LAPTOP THIS IS KILLING ME HERE 
WELL DONE 
MAGGIE DAVE I JUST KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT I LIKED WHEN WE FIRST MET 
THAT'S NOW BEEN REINFORCED BY THE FACT THAT YOU CHOSE MY PROPERTY TO TEST DRIVE 
SO WHY DID YOU PICK THIS PLACE 
FINANCIAL YEAH IT'S AN AMAZING PRICE ISN'T IT 
IT'S A FABULOUS PRICE IT DOESN'T NEED A LOT OF WORK AND IT LOOKS NICE 
WITH IT BEING A MODERN PROPERTY THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE MUCH WRONG 
WITH IT WE HOPE BUT WE HAVE HAD OUR MAN IN TO HAVE A LOOK OVER IT 
I MUST STRESS IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY 
AND IF YOU WERE EVER GOING TO BUY A PROPERTY 
GET A FULL STRUCTURAL SURVEY CARRIED OUT FIRST 
HOWEVER HE HAS RAISED A FEW VERY USEFUL THINGS 
FIRST BEING THE EXTENSION ON THE SIDE THAT WASN'T BUILT WITH THE REST OF THE HOUSE 
YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR FULL CERTIFICATE FOR THE BUILDING REGULATIONS WITH THAT 
IF YOU WERE TO BUY IT YOUR SOLICITOR WOULD DO THAT CHECK FOR YOU ANYWAY 
YEP RIGHT ONE OTHER THING WITH IT BEING SUCH A NEW HOUSE 
IF IT'S UNDER TEN YEARS OLD CHECK THAT IT HAS THE RIGHT CERTIFICATE FROM THE BUILDER THEMSELVES 
TO ALLOW YOU TO GET A MORTGAGE AGAINST THE PLACE 
ALTHOUGH SOME FIRMS ARE GENEROUS AND EXTEND THAT PERIOD TO FIFTEEN YEARS 
WE LIKE THEM TALKING OF GENEROUS IT IS TIME FOR YOUR TEST DRIVE TO SEE IF THIS HOUSE REALLY SUITS YOU 
GET IN THERE USE AND ABUSE AS YOU LIKE WITHIN REASON AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER ON 
GO ON THANKS VERY MUCH 
NOW CALL ME A PARTY POOPER BUT CHECKING THE BOILER ISN'T THE FIRST THING I'D BE DOING IN A NEW HOUSE
