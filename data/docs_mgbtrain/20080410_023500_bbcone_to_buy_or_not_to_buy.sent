WHILST WE GET OURSELVES SORTED HERE'S A LITTLE A BIT ABOUT THE COUNTY OF WARWICKSHIRE 
IT'S A SPARKLING GEM IN THE CENTRE OF ENGLAND AND IS A PERFECT LOCATION TO THE M. FORTY SO GREAT FOR COMMUTERS 
THE COUNTY IS PEPPERED WITH BEAUTIFUL IDYLLIC VILLAGES AND TOWNS 
THE COUNTRYSIDE IS LIKE A D. A. VINCI PAINTING 
BEAUTIFUL COLOURFUL TEXTURED INTERESTING AND STEEPED IN HISTORY 
YES HOME OF THAT BARD SHAKESPEARE 
NOW HOW WOULD HE HAVE DESCRIBED THIS PLACE 
SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SUMMER'S DAY

NOW BECAUSE OF ITS GREAT LOCATION YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF AIR MILES TO AFFORD THIS 
THE AVERAGE PRICE TAG FOR A THREE BEDROOMED PROPERTY 
IN A SEMI RURAL VILLAGE SETTING IS AROUND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND 
SO LET'S START SEARCHING HIGH AND LOW 
AND WHILE I HITCH AN APPROPRIATE LIFT HERE'S WHAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
AND THE FIFTEEN I LENT THEM EARLIER CAN GET YOU AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
IN BELLINGHAM GREATER LONDON ON A NICE CORNER PLOT IS THIS EXTENDED THREE BED SEMI

ARE YOU GOING FOR THAT STUFF OR ARE YOU GOING FOR THIS STUFF HERE THOSE BITS 
WHAT KIND OF PASTA DO YOU PREFER 
OUR TABLE WILL FIT QUITE A FEW PEOPLE AROUND THIS ROOM THAT'S FINE 
THE DINING TABLE COULD TAKE BOTH REALLY 
IT'S ALL ABOUT SAUCES THEY ARE VEHICLES FOR SAUCES 
THIS IS QUITE NICE ISN'T IT NO PO PICCOLA PO PICCOLA 
POBLICO WHAT'S THAT WORD 
HE'S SAYING I'VE EXCELLED MYSELF 
RUBBISH A LITTLE BIT SMALL YES ED HASN'T REALLY DONE A GOOD JOB HERE 
HAS HE NOT EXCELLED HIMSELF NOT REALLY 
I ASKED HIM FOR A BIGGER KITCHEN COS YOU KNOW ME COS IF I STAND HERE 
THIS IS O. K. IT'S GOT THIS COOKER IT'S A BIT 
A BIT TIGHT ISN'T IT REALLY IT'S NOT RIGHT 
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S A SMALL KITCHEN BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SKY SERVING YOUR LASAGNE DISH 
TO PASSENGERS OR WHATEVER YOU DON'T HAVE HUGE KITCHENS 
HE SHOULD BE USED TO SMALL STAINLESS STEEL COUNTERS CONFINED AREAS 
YEAH THE WALLS LOOK LIKE THEY'VE EITHER BEEN RECENTLY PLASTERED OR THEY'VE JUST PUT WALLPAPER ON THEM 
IT'S NICE COS IT'S PLAIN AS WELL IT'S PLAIN IT'S PLAIN AND THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT PLANES 
SEE WHAT YOU DID AH THAT'S A NICE BATHROOM 
I QUITE LIKE THIS IT'S NICE IT IS VERY NICE 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN OURS BUT IT'S NICE 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR TOILET SINK BATH AND SHOWER 
AND THE BATH HAS A SHOWER 
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED 
HOW MANY TIMES DO PEOPLE SAY IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED WITH SURPRISE 
MOST BATHROOMS DO HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED 
IT HAS A BATH AND A TOILET MOST OF THEM 
IT WOULD BE A FUNDAMENTAL ERROR HANG ON A MINUTE THERE'S NO TOILET IN THIS HOUSE 
I GUESS THIS IS THE THIRD BEDROOM LOOKS LIKE IT 
BUT IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE IS IT 
GOOD SIZE GOOD SIZE THEY'VE CRAMMED A LOT IN YEAH 
ED WHAT COULD YOU CRAM IN THAT ROOM IN THAT BEDROOM 
A BED PROBABLY PUT A BED IN THERE YEAH THAT'S BITS OF STORAGE THE OLD CLASSICS 
ALSO WE COULD HAVE LIKE A SOFA BED IN HERE OR SOMETHING AS WELL 
HOW ABOUT A SOFA BED THERE YOU GO 
SHE'S GOT A GOOD IDEA THERE HASN'T SHE WHEN FRIENDS STAY 
WOW THIS IS REALLY BIG 
IT IS IT IS BIG ISN'T IT YEAH 
I WONDER IF THERE IS ANOTHER BEDROOM AFTER THIS 
OR IF IT'S JUST A TWO BEDROOM 
I WONDER IF HE GOT ONE THING RIGHT 
YOU MAY HAVE GOT SOMETHING RIGHT APPARENTLY ED 
WHY COS HE DIDN'T GET SEMI RURAL OR A BIG ENOUGH KITCHEN 
SEMI RURAL IS ALL ABOUT A MIND STATE MM HMM 
MY MIND STATE IS LOOKING PURELY OUT THERE THAT'S RURAL 
YOUR MIND IS CERTAINLY IN SOME SORT OF STATE 
YEAH SHE'LL LOVE THAT LITTLE GARDEN 
WHAT IS NICE AS WELL YOU'RE NOT DIRECTLY OVERLOOKED BY ANYONE

A SMALL LITTLE ALPINE KINDA SHED THING WHICH ONE 
BELLA STANZA EH THIS IS GORGEOUS 
IT IS ISN'T IT I LIKE THIS 
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO SEE US THEY'RE SAYING SOMETHING'S GORGEOUS 
THIS ROOM MAKES THE HOUSE I THINK 
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE QUITE SMALL COS THAT ROOM IS REALLY BIG ISN'T IT NICE ROOM 
YOU CAN SEE THE RACECOURSE OUT OF THE WINDOW IT WOULD BE A NICE VIEW 
WE COULD SIT HERE JUST WATCHING THE RACE 
BE OUR OWN IN FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT 
EDUARDO I THINK YOU'VE IMPRESSED THEM

QUITE MOODY DOWNSTAIRS ABOUT THE KITCHEN 
YES YEAH YOU WERE 
BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW LOOK AT THIS 
IN YOUR ROOF AN ATTIC ROOM 
I KNOW IT IS A SURPRISE THIS IS LOVELY I LIKE THIS 
SO POTENTIALLY YOU HAVE GOT A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE HERE 
TO ACHIEVE THAT AND MAKE IT FULLY FUNCTIONAL YOU WOULD NEED A STAIRWAY 
YOU CAN PROBABLY DO IT THROUGH THIS ROOM HERE OR MAYBE THROUGH THAT ROOM THERE 
YOU WOULD NEED TO SEEK PLANNING PERMISSION TO PUT THE STAIRWELL IN 
BUT POTENTIALLY YOU HAVE A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE HERE 
WHICH IS ONE MORE BEDROOM THAN YOU ASKED FOR THAT'S TRUE 
WE COULD HAVE EVEN MORE CHILDREN COULDN'T WE 
COME ON THEN ARE YOU GOING TO GO FOR THREE

YOUR DINING ROOM AND KITCHEN ARE A LITTLE BIT SMALL AND A BIT TIGHT 
THE BEDROOM SUNSHINE 
THAT'S ALL FORGOTTEN ABOUT REALLY 
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS YOU'VE GOT A GARAGE HERE 
ORDINARILY THAT'S THE SIZE WE'VE GOT AN EXTRA SLITHER 
SO IF YOU WANTED TO PARK A CAR AND HAVE ED STAND NEXT TO IT 
AND CLOSE THE DOOR YOU CAN LOCK HIM IN IT'S A GREAT IDEA I WOULD CALL THAT A DOUBLE GARAGE 
BORDERING ON DOUBLE BUT NOT QUITE 
YOU'VE UNDERSOLD MY HOUSE DOUBLE GARAGE IT'S A GARAGE AND A HALF 
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE THAT FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE PRIVATE 
WITH THAT GREAT BIG GAPING HOLE ON TO THE ROAD YEAH

I'VE GIVEN YOU THE KITCHEN OF YOUR DREAMS 
YOU HAVE YES YOU HAVE INDEED BUT WHAT I HAVEN'T GIVEN YOU ARE THE INGREDIENTS OF YOUR DREAMS AH 
THIS CLAUDIO IS AN ALLOTMENT 
THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE CURRENTLY RENTS THIS ALLOTMENT FOR HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK A YEAR 
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU SIX 
THAT'S NOTHING I RECKON LOOKING AT THE STATE OF IT WE COULD GET IT DOWN TO THREE A YEAR THREE A YEAR 
SO FOR SIX A YEAR YOU COULD HAVE YOUR OWN MARKET GARDEN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD GROW AS CLAUDIO THE ALLOTMENT MAN 
CLAUDIO THE ALLOTMENT MAN HE'D GROW TOMATOES CUCUMBERS MAYBE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'D GROW BECAUSE HE'S NEVER DONE IT BEFORE 
GEORGIA COULD LEARN TO GARDEN SHE COULD OR JO

I'D SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND 
OVER YOUR BUDGET WE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT 
I THINK IT'S OVER OUR BUDGET THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT 
IT'S A NICE VILLAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND 
STOP IT WHAT I RECKON IT'S A MOCKERY OF THIS SHOW 
ZERO POINT TWO FIVE FOUR 
I'M GOING TO STOP YOU THERE 
CLAUDIO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS SHE'S WON NO YOU'VE WON 
WE TRIED WE TRIED 
HE WAS TELLING JO THE ANSWER 
SO THE DEAL IS THIS ALL RIGHT IT IS SLIGHTLY OVER YOUR BUDGET 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY WAS WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO SAY TO YOU 
HAGGLE YOU COULD GET IT UNDERNEATH THE STAMP DUTY THING YOU COULD GET IT 
SO WE COULD STILL DO IT POTENTIALLY 
IT'S WORTH THROWING AN OFFER IN DEFINITELY LISTEN 
WE'VE SHOWN YOU THREE GREAT PROPERTIES THINK ABOUT WHICH ONE TO TEST DRIVE 
THINK ABOUT IT HARD GO FOR A LOVELY WALK DOWN THERE AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER ON FOR THE BIG DECISION 
TAKE YOURSELF OFF WHY NOT GO PAST THE ALLOTMENT GO FOR IT LOVELY 
MARVELLOUS AND WHILE THEY'RE OFF DECIDING THAT VERY BIG DECISION 
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP FOR YOU AT HOME 
WILL CLAUDIO AND JO GO BACK TO THIS THREE BED PLACE 
WHERE THEY CAN HAVE BOTH SEMI RURAL AND TOWN CHIC AND THEY CAN WATCH HORSERACING FOR FREE 
ALL FOR THE PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
SOUNDS LIKE A BARGAIN NO I'M SORRY ED THEY'LL PREFER MY CHOICE 
THEY WANTED SEMI RURAL SO I GAVE THEM SEMI RURAL WITH THIS PROPERTY IN THE VILLAGE OF PILLERTON PRIORS 
THEY CALLED IT MAGNIFICO 
AND AT ONLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND I SHOULD SAY SO 
BUT WILL THEY SACRIFICE BEING FURTHER AWAY FROM THE M. FORTY 
FOR THIS SLICE OF COUNTRY LIFE WITH THIS THREE BEDROOM COTTAGE IN THE VILLAGE OF NEWBOLD ON STOUR 
WELL LIKE CLAUDIO SAID IT COMBINES OLD AND NEW 
AND THEY WERE BOTH COMPLETELY ENCHANTED BY THE KITCHEN 
BUT DOES IT SERVE THEIR NEEDS AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
CLAUDIO AND JO YOU LOVE THE WILD CARD 
COS YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO TEST DRIVE THE WILD CARD
