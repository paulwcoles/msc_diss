AND THE POOL HOUSE ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH WHAT ARE WE STEPPING ONTO 
WE WANT SOMEWHERE BIGGER AS IN HOUSE WISE AND SOMEWHERE 
TO PUT THIS BIG POOL TABLE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE A DOUBLE GARAGE 
O. K. NOW I BELIEVE ONE OF THE REASONS BEHIND THIS IS IS COMMUTE PROBLEMS JOHN

SOMEWHERE A BIT FURTHER NORTH OF HERE WOULD BE GREAT 
O. K. SO WHAT'S YOUR IDEAL COMMUTE LENGTH WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR

YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE TO BIRMINGHAM NOT REALLY 
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS GO ON 
THE HOUSE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT MUST IT HAVE WHAT'S IT GOT TO BE LIKE

IT'S TRUE YOU DO YOU DO SING I DO 
WHAT KIND OF STYLE PROPERTY WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE IN 
WELL I PREFER THE MORE MODERN ONE TO BE HONEST 
SOMETHING IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR SO RIGHT O. K. 
ANY PARTICULAR REASON FOR MODERN 
JUST THE PERIOD FEATURES YOU GET IN THE OLD HOUSES I'M NOT TOO KEEN ON THAT REALLY 
GOOD MAN NO HANG ON NOW HOLD ON HERE LET'S DISCUSS THIS 
I'VE NEVER MET ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T LIKE PERIOD FEATURES 
LOOK AT HIS STANCE FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE 
NO NO NO I WANT TO EXTRACT I WANT TO FIND OUT MORE 
WHY GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT LIKE KIND OF OLD TILED FLOORS 
YEAH AND THE FIREPLACES THEY DON'T DO IT FOR ME 
ANNE DO YOU AGREE WITH JOHN OR DO YOU AGREE WITH KRISTIAN 
I THINK I'D RATHER TRY NEW FOR A CHANGE AND I'VE ALWAYS LIVED IN AN OLDER HOUSE 
WE KNOW WE NEED NEW 
WE NEED TO BE WITHIN FORTY FIVE MINUTES FROM BIRMINGHAM 
AND WE JUST NEED A LOT OF SPACE 
WE DON'T KNOW THE BIG ONE 
BUDGET HOW MUCH 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND MAXIMUM 
RIGHT SHALL WE GO AND PONDER THAT AND SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND

O. K. O. K. IMAGINE THEM 
USE A POPULAR REFERENCE LIKE IAN BEALE HE WOULD BE THE KIND OF MAN THAT WOULD LIKE THOSE HOUSES 
I'M PLAYING YOUR TUNE AREN'T I NO SORRY I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
PERIOD FEATURES HAVE GOT THE BEAUTY OF KATE MOSS WITH THE CHARM OF ROGER MOORE 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE IMPORTANT I AM A PERIOD FEATURE SUFFRAGETTE 
SO YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THEM PERIOD FEATURES ARE YOU EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T WANT THEM 
I DESPAIR 
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING NOW WHAT OF DROITWICH SPA 
LIKE MANY OTHER SPA TOWNS AROUND THE COUNTRY TWAS A PLAYGROUND 
AND HEALTH RESORT FOR THE VICTORIANS 
AND THE DECADENCE AND LEISURE FACILITIES OF THE ERA ARE STILL EVIDENT 
DO YOU KNOW THERE ARE AT LEAST FIFTEEN PUBS IN THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN ALONE 
SO PLENTY OF VENUES FOR ANNE TO SING AROUND 
AND WITH FANTASTIC MOTORWAY LINKS GREAT ACCESS TO BOTH 
BIRMINGHAM AND WORCESTER AND ITS OWN FRENCH CHATEAU PROPERTY PRICES ARE BOUND TO BOOM 
BUT WHAT CAN A VA VA VOOM BUDGET OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND GET YOU AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

A STUNNING TWO BED MODERN APARTMENT 
AT THE VERY GATEWAY TO THE JURASSIC COAST 
YOURS IF YOU SHELLED OUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

MEANT YOU WERE MORE WEALTHY AND WERE SHOWING OFF 
AND THE MODERN ARCHITECTURE WHAT DOES THAT TELL US

RIGHT POOL TABLE THERE MM 
OH THIS IS NICE BIG CONSERVATORY DEFINITELY 
I CAN JUST SEE ME LYING HERE AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT SCHOOL EXCELLENT 
HARD I CAN IMAGINE LYING THERE 
THERE IS SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT A MAN SAYING AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT SCHOOL 
DON'T BELITTLE TEACHERS IF THIS GOES OUT IN SCHOOL HOLIDAYS THEY'LL BE AFTER YOU 
WOULD MY MUSIC EQUIPMENT FIT IN HERE WHAT WOULD YOU PUT IN THAT CONSERVATORY 
I WOULD PUT THE POOL TABLE IN THERE OR SINGING EQUIPMENT 
FOR HER TO SING IN YES THAT IS LUDICROUS 
THAT IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS SUGGESTION THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID IT SHE'LL SAY IT SOON DO YOU KNOW WHY WHY IT'S MADE OF GLASS 
I'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HIT HIGH NOTES SHE'S NOT A SOPRANO EDWARD 
MARIAH CAREY CAN OPEN A GARAGE DOOR WITH HER VOICE REALLY 
OH THIS IS QUITE NICE YEAH YEAH IT IS YEAH JUST 
AT LEAST IT'S NICE AND SQUARE ISN'T IT 
IT'S A NON COMPLAINABLE LOUNGE AS THEY'VE JUST PROVED BECAUSE YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT 
HIGH PRAISE IT IS THE GREATEST LOUNGE WE'VE EVER SHOWN ON TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
I'M GOING TO BE THEIR ECHO NOW AND SAY IT'S A BIT SMALL 
IT'S A BIT SMALL CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT 
SO A LITTLE BIT ON THE SMALL SIDE YOU KNOW YOU'LL HAVE YOUR PLASMA THERE WON'T YOU 
YEAH AND THE FIRE'S QUITE BIG ISN'T IT 
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GAS AS WELL DOESN'T IT SO YEAH LIVING FLAME 
STOP STOP 
I SAID THERE EDWARD 
EDWARD YOU'RE CHEATING 
IT'S THE GREATEST HOUSE WE'VE EVER SHOWN WHICH IS WHY IT'S A VERTICAL THUMB 
IT HAS TO BE HE'S A CHEAT LET'S GO LEFT SHALL WE O. K. 
GO IN THIS ROOM O. K. WE'LL GO LEFT 
VERY BROWN ISN'T IT 
BY COLOUR DEDUCTION THEY ARE IN THE SALON DE BAIN 
CAN I BE HONEST VERY PRACTICAL 
I WONDER IF THIS IS THE UM 
SMALLEST ROOM IT'S DEFINITELY A SINGLE ROOM ISN'T IT 
SMALL SMALL 
OH THE GREATEST HOUSE EVER ON TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
IN BRACKETS SLIGHTLY SMALL 
BUT SAYING THAT IT'S STUDY BIG ENOUGH ISN'T IT REALLY 
YEAH YOU CAN FIT DESKS IN YOU'D GET THE COMPUTERS IN WOULDN'T YOU DEFINITELY O. K. 
HOW CAN THIS BE THE GREATEST HOUSE ON TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
WHEN THEY'RE SOUNDING MORE THAN JUST A LITTLE BIT DESPONDENT YOU'RE NOT READING BETWEEN THE LINES 
I SUPPOSE THIS WOULD EITHER BE KATIE'S OR A GUEST ROOM REALLY 
STORAGE ALREADY HERE YEAH BUILT IN 
WE CAN'T FIT MUCH ELSE IN REALLY BESIDES A BED WE'VE GOT A KING SIZE BED HAVEN'T WE 
YOU WON'T GET THE KING SIZE IN BUT IT IS A GOOD SIZE DOUBLE IT IS 
OH RIGHT THIS MUST BE THE MASTER BEDROOM THEN WELL THAT'S A. 
YEAH THIS IS GOOD SIZE ISN'T IT SHALL WE SEE WHAT'S IN HERE YEAH 
THIS IS NICE ISN'T IT 
NICE CLEAN WHITE TILES 
WHITE YEAH NOT BROWN NOT BROWN 
IT'S GOING DOWN WELL ISN'T IT WELL IT'S GOING DOWN AS I THOUGHT 
IT'S NOT EVEN A BROWN SUITE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT 
CAN I BORROW YOUR HANKIE COURSE YOU CAN 
GO ON THANKS VERY MUCH 
YOU'VE GENERATED REAL TEARS THERE 
ED IT'S EDDIE YOU'RE RIGHT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT 
HONESTLY THIS IS AT HOME NOW YOU'RE THE PRIVILEGED ONES 
WELL I THINK WE STARTED OFF QUITE WELL DOWNSTAIRS BUT THEN 
IT SORT OF GOT A LITTLE BIT SMALL UPSTAIRS SHALL WE GO AND SEE THE BOYS YEAH 
ED I FEEL WITH YOUR CHOICE YOU HAVE GIVEN AND YOU HAVE GIVEN AND YOU HAVE GIVEN 
GIVEN THEM AND THE NATION YEAH SHALL WE GIVE SOME MORE TIPS COME ON 
NOW THIS HOUSE WAS BUILT IN THE NINETIES AND YET SOMEHOW 
THE OWNER DECIDED TO BUILD A NINETEEN SEVENTIES' FIREPLACE IN HERE 
IT'S QUITE ODD I WOULD SAY AND MAYBE SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET RID OF 
MORE THAN LIKELY 
BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT CLUMSY INTERESTING FACT 
BURT REYNOLDS USED TO INVITE PEOPLE ROUND TO HIS HOUSE IN THE SEVENTIES 
TO PLAY A GAME OF PICTIONARY IN FRONT OF HIS SEVENTY'S FIREPLACE WHICH WOULD HAVE LOOKED CLOSE TO THIS 
AND HE INVENTED THE GAME WIN LOSE OR DRAW BASED ON THAT 
AND EVERY SET YOU SEE OF THE GAME SHOW WIN LOSE OR DRAW IS BASED ON BURT REYNOLDS' SEVENTIES' FIREPLACE 
THAT IS ACTUALLY A FACT 
SO UNLESS YOU'VE GOT A GOOD GAME SHOW IDEA WE COULD PROBABLY GET RID OF THAT GET RID OF IT 
IN THERE IS A SMALL CHIMNEY AND SO IT DOES ACTUALLY FUNCTION 
THEY CAN'T JUST KNOCK THIS OUT ENTIRELY NO 
SO YOU COULD PUT A CUTESY WOOD BURNING STOVE THERE KICK THIS ALL OUT 
AND MAKE IT LITERALLY A QUARTER OF THE SIZE THEREFORE YOU'VE GOT MORE SPACE 
IT'S LESS IMPOSING AND KIND OF NICER SOMETHING YOU MIGHT CONSIDER 
YOU'D WANT TO GET RID OF IT MAYBE KNOCK IT OUT BUT NOT PUT ONE BACK IN AGAIN 
ALL RIGHT WE COULD DO HALF THE JOB AT LEAST 
WELL THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT YES 
WE NOW NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE PRICE OF THE HOUSE O. K. 
O. K. KRISTIAN IS THIS WAY AND LET'S GO AND FIND OUT HOW MUCH IT COSTS 
DO YOU THINK IT'S THE BEST HOUSE EVER 
THERE MIGHT BE BETTER TO COME I THINK O. K. 
HE PROMISED MORE OUTSIDE DIDN'T HE HE DID 
HE SAID THERE WERE GIFTS FOR YOU AND THEY ARE FOR YOU 
SO FIRST UP WE HAVE IN THERE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT SPACE 
GOOD SPACE MY BIKE WOULD FIT IN THERE WOULDN'T IT IT WOULD 
DO YOU NOTICE A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THE OTHER END 
THERE'S NO WAY OUT THERE'S NO OUT THERE'S ONLY AN IN YEAH 
THE CURRENT OWNER'S SAID HE CAN GET RID OF THAT WALL FOR YOU 
SO YOU CAN USE THE GARAGE DOOR THE OTHER SIDE THEN OVER HERE 
OH RIGHT SEE EVERY BOY LOVES THIS EVERY BOY WILL LOVE THIS SPACE 
WOULD YOU UTILISE THAT IN ANY INTERESTING WAY 
NOT REALLY NO SORRY I STAND CORRECTED I'M WRONG 
YOU'RE NOT EXCITED ABOUT THAT 
NOT REALLY I DON'T FEEL I'VE DONE ED'S HOUSE ANY JUSTICE HERE 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRICE O. K. 
LET'S SEE IF THAT WORKS OUT ANY BETTER 
UM THAT WENT BRILLIANTLY STILL THE BEST HOUSE WE'VE EVER FEATURED 
GREAT WORK GOOD STUFF WELL DONE MATE 
JOHN ACTUALLY WASN'T THAT JAZZED REALLY 
BEDROOMS ARE A BIT TOO SMALL FOR ME YEAH AND THE SHEDS 
TECHNICALLY SPEAKING YOU'RE WRONG I'D SAY RIGHT YOU ARE RIGHT 
WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH THIS BEAUTY COSTS 
KRISTIAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO TEE THEM OFF RIGHT O. K. 
UM I'M GOING TO START WITH ANNE 
OH NO O. K. OH YES GO ON 
GIVE US A PRICE THREE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY AND YOUR ACTUAL BUDGET WAS 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
SO YOU YOU I'VE COME DOWN YOU'RE NEAR BUT NOT QUITE O. K. AND 
OH DEAR 
I'D SAY A BIT LESS THREE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND 
EDWARD OVER TO YOU YOU'VE MASSIVELY OVERVALUED IT 
IT IS ONLY ON AT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THINK OF THE SPARE MONEY YOU'VE GOT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS AMAZING ISN'T IT IT'S A VERY GOOD PRICE YOU SEE 
DO YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE SHED THAT YOU KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO WITH 
UM BE BETTER IF THERE WAS A HOT TUB IN THERE 
WELL YOU'VE GOT THE MONEY FOR THE HOT TUB NOW 
TELL YOU WHAT I LIKE THE WAY HE THINKS IT'S A LOVELY IDEA 
MY HOUSE IS A TREAT IT'S WAITING FOR BOTH OF YOU 
IT'S THIS WAY PUSH PAST THE HANGING BASKET COME ON 
YES PROPERTY TWO FOUR BEDROOMS A DINING ROOM LOUNGE DOWNSTAIRS AND A DOUBLE GARAGE YES A DOUBLE 
DOESN'T HAVE A WORKSHOP THOUGH NO IT DOESN'T NEED IT 
AND TO TOP ALL OF THAT IT'S CLOSE TO THE M. FIVE HOW CLOSE 
CLOSE 
SO I FOUND YOU THIS WHICH I THINK IS LOVELY FOR A MODERN PROPERTY 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE IT'S COMPLETELY DETACHED VERY LARGE DOUBLE GARAGE 
BACKS ON TO THE M. FIVE WHICH IS JUST OVER THERE 
IT'S A FANTASTIC MOTORWAY AND YOU WANTED TO GET GOOD LINKS TO BIRMINGHAM 
SO THAT'S A GREAT CHOICE I LOVE IT EDWARD DO ME A FAVOUR ONE MOMENT SO NEAR YOU CAN HEAR IT 
WHICH IS HOW NEAR IT IS WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOUR 
GIVE ME FIFTEEN TWENTY SECONDS I'LL GO OVER HERE

VERY NICE FROM THE OUTSIDE REALLY VERY NICE REALLY 
GOOD THE DOUBLE GARAGE IS EXCELLENT 
IT'S A BONUS ISN'T IT YOU DID MENTION THE OLD M. FIVE 
WE OF COURSE I DID JUST THERE THE M. FIVE 
THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS SENDING YOU IN THERE THAT ROAD THERE 
AND TELLING ME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE INSIDE O. K. ALL RIGHT GO FOR IT 
I'M NOT GOING TO RELEASE MY FOOT OFF YOUR FOOT UNTIL YOU REMAIN SILENT 
YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE IF I WAS SILENT OR NOT BECAUSE OF THE NOISE OF THE M. FIVE THERE KRISTIAN 
AH THE STUDY LOOKS LIKE A STUDY ALREADY KITTED OUT THERE 
SOMEWHERE FOR THE COMPUTERS ISN'T IT 
I'M CONFUSED YOUR HOUSE DIDN'T HAVE A SEPARATE STUDY 
THIS ONE HAS AND THEY'RE NOT BEING OVERWHELMED BY IT 
THAT'S NOT THE CRITERIA FOR THE GREATEST HOUSE EVER SHOWN THEY WANTED A STUDY 
NICE AND NEW OH RIGHT YEAH AGAIN GOOD SIZE ISN'T IT YEAH 
IF YOU LIVED IN DROITWICH SPA AND DROITWICH SPA IS FAMOUS FOR SALT 
YOUR FOOD MUST TASTE AMAZING ALL THE TIME 
NICE LITTLE SEPARATE DINING AREA AS WELL 
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A CONSERVATORY OUT THERE AS WELL O. K. 
WELL DON'T YOU JUST GET THE FEELING YOU WANT TO SEASON EVERYTHING 
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT BUT HAVE YOU GOT SOMETHING DOWN THERE 
A DINING ROOM THAT WOULD DEFINITELY FIT OUR TABLE WOULDN'T IT YEAH THAT'S A GOOD SIZE 
KRISTIAN WHILST PLACING SALT ON ME YOU'VE MISSED SOMETHING 
THEY'VE DONE THE KITCHEN THEY DIDN'T SPEND LONG IN THERE I CAN'T 
EXCELLENT THROUGH TO A CONSERVATORY YOUR FAVOURITE 
YEAH AND THE FLOORING AS WELL 
THAT'S A GOOD SIZE ISN'T IT DEFINITELY 
NOW TRY AND TELL ME THAT CONSERVATORY IS WORSE THAN THE ONE YOU SHOWED THEM

ALMOST THE SAME WHICH IS HIGH PRAISE HIGH PRAISE INDEED 
NOT OVERLOOKED AT ALL VERY PRIVATE THAT'S GOOD YEAH SHALL WE LOOK AT THE LOUNGE

HELLO A LOUNGE BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO SOFAS 
TWO SOFAS RATHER THAN ONE 
HUH THEY CAN FIT TWO SOFAS IN THERE 
YOU LIKE THE FIREPLACE IT'S ALL RIGHT YEAH IT'S UNUSUAL 
OBVIOUSLY TO GO WITH A NEWER HOUSE MODERN ISN'T IT YEAH 
INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HATRED OF PERIOD FEATURES 
WHAT I THINK'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT MODERN FIRE IT ECHOES IT ECHOES A BIT OF GEORGIAN DESIGN 
MINE ECHOED THE SEVENTIES IN MY HOUSE 
THERE YOU GO I WOULDN'T SAY THAT WAS A PERIOD FEATURE 
OH WOW THAT'S A BIGGISH ROOM ISN'T IT GOOD SIZE DOUBLE ISN'T IT 
NICE AND SQUARE ISN'T IT YEAH YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH A SQUARE ROOM

NICE AND SQUARE IT IS NICE AND SQUARE IT IS NICE AND SQUARE 
I DON'T RECALL YOUR ROOMS BEING PRAISED FOR THE SIZE EDWARD NO NOR THEIR SQUARENESS NO 
BIT SMALLER THAN THE OTHER ONE ISN'T IT WELL IT IS BUT IT DEPENDS 
AS I SAID I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE SMALLER OF THE BEDROOMS

LET'S GO DOWN AND SEE THEM O. K. 
YOU'VE SEEN OUR TWO WILD CARD OPTIONS 
THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE ON TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
WHICH MAKES GUESSING THE PRICE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED 
THE WAY WE'LL DO THIS IS ANNE YOU'LL GUESS THE PRICE FOR THE HOUSE WE SAW TOGETHER 
SO NEXT DOOR WHAT DO YOU THINK 
O. K. WELL I THINK IT'S SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THIS ONE 
I THINK IT'LL BE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THREE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WILL YOU BE PLEASED WHEN I TELL YOU IT'S ACTUALLY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND 
THAT'S A SURPRISE THERE IT IS WRITTEN ON MY HAND 
THAT'S GOOD A SURPRISE A GOOD SURPRISE 
O. K. SO YOU'VE RADICALLY OVERVALUED AND GOOD NEWS 
SO WE ARE IN THIS HOUSE 
JOHN YOU WENT ROUND THIS HOUSE WE HAD A LOVELY TIME 
YEAH YOU'VE EXPERIENCED IT ENJOYED IT THE PRICE YOU THINK IS 
WELL I THINK IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN NEXT DOOR 
IT'S GOT BIGGER ROOMS SO I WOULD SAY THREE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND 
THREE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND O. K. 
THE PRICE IS THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I KNOW YOUR MAXIMUM BUDGET WAS THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE LOVE A HAGGLE 
THEY SET IT THERE AS A CHALLENGE REALLY 
ULTIMATELY WE HAVE SHOWN YOU FOUR PROPERTIES YOU LUCKY THINGS

WILL JOHN AND ANNE GO FOR PROPERTY NO ONE 
THE GREATEST EVER FEATURED WITH FOUR BEDROOMS LOUNGE 
DINING ROOM EXTRA WORKSHOP AND SINGLE GARAGE

OR WILL THEY GO FOR MY SUGGESTION PROPERTY TWO MODEST IN CHARACTER 
BUT NOT IN SIZE WITH ITS EXTRA STUDY 
AND DETACHED DOUBLE GARAGE AND ALL FOR THREE HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

I'M SLIGHTLY FUMING BUT NEVER MIND IT IS LOVELY IT IS LOVELY 
SHALL WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT 
O. K. BEFORE YOU DO YOUR TEST DRIVE WE'VE HAD THE TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
SURVEYOR GO ROUND AND HE'S POINTED OUT SOME INTERESTING THINGS 
NOT LEGALLY BINDING BUT INTERESTING 
IMPORTANTLY THERE IS A BROOK QUITE BEAUTIFULLY 
BABBLING BESIDE THE PROPERTY WHICH IS VERY NICE 
BUT HE DID SAY WHAT YOU SHOULD DO 
IS FIND OUT WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THAT BROOK SHOULD IT EVER FLOOD 
IN YOUR SEARCHES HAS IT EVER FLOODED 
AND BECAUSE THE LAND DIPS DOWN HERE WHERE DOES THE WATER RUN OFF TO 
O. K. SO YOU JUST NEED TO CHECK THOSE THINGS AS A SENSIBLE PRECAUTION 
O. K. AND OTHER POINT AS IT'S BEEN RAINING TODAY YOU CAN NOTICE 
THAT IT'S DRIPPING INSIDE THE CARPORT 
THAT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE ROOF FELT ABOVE THE CARPORT 
NEEDS CHANGING REALLY THAT DOESN'T COST PARTICULARLY MUCH
