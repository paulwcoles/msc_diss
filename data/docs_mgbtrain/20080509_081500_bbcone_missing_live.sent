TEN CALLS SO WE ARE TAKING THAT AS 
A POSITIVE SIGN THAT IS GOOD FOR A 
CASE THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 
FIVE YEARS 
IS THAT UNUSUAL IS 
THAT NORMAL 
MOST MISSING PEOPLE 
TURN UP QUICKLY BUT IT HAS BEEN A 
LONG PERIOD OF TIME THE FAMILY ARE 
ANXIOUS TO HAVE NEWS SO WE URGE 
ANYONE WITH ANY AMOUNT OF 
INFORMATION HOWEVER INSIGNIFICANT 
TO CALL US 
I THINK WE HAVE A 
PICTURE OF CRAIG TO REMIND PEOPLE 
AT HOME WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE 
A GOOD DESCRIPTION HE IS AN OENG 
ENGINEERING STUDENT SO HE IS A 
TALL GUY HE IS SLIM WITH SHORT 
FAIR HAIR IN ANYONE HAS SEEN HIM 
WITH URGE THEM TO GET IN CONTACT 
AND YOUR LINES ARE OPEN TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS IT IS 
HER JOB THE PATROL THE STREETS BUT 
THERE IS ONE CASE SHE CAN'T SOL 
THE CASE OF HER OWN MISSING BROTHER 
SOLVE 
IN LONDON ALONE ROUND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
PEOPLE ARE REPORTED MISSING EVERY 
YEAR TEAMS OF DEDICATED POLICE 
OFFICERS WORK NIGHT AND DAY TO FIND 
THEM PENNY BATEMAN JOINED THE MET 
OVER A YEAR AGO SHE IS A CONSTABLE 
AT HACKNEY POLICE STATION ON ONE 
OF THE BUSIEST BEATS IN THE COUNTRY 
SHE HAS WORKED ON ALL SORTS OF 
CASES HERSELF BUT TODAY SHE IS 
ASKING FOR THE POLICE TO HELP HER 
WITH A VERY PERSONAL INVESTIGATION 
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR MY BROTHER 
DAVID DAVID BATEMAN WHO HAS BEEN 
MISSING I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR THIRTEEN 
FOURTEEN YEARS THE LAST TIME THE FAMILY 
SAW HIM WAS ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO 
SO WE ARE CONCERNED AS TO WHERE HE 
S. I AM GOING TO FILE A MISSING 
PEPPERS REPORT AT HACKNEY PENNY PENNY HAS TRIED TO FIND HER BROTHER MANY 
TIMES IN THE PAST BUT SHE HAS HAD 
NO LUCK SHE WON'T GET ANY SPECIAL 
TREATMENT AT HACKNEY BECAUSE SHE 
WORKS THERE BECAUSE SHE IS OPENING 
WITH THEIR HELP SHE WILL HAVE MORE 
SUCCESS THIS TIME PENNY HAS AP 
APPOINTMENT WITH GRAHAM PALMER AT 
THE MISSING PERSONS UNIT 
IT IS 
REALLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHEN HE 
WENT MISSING 
THE LAST TIME DAVID 
WAS SEEN A WEEK BEFORE MY BROTHER'S 
WEDDING HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE I 
CAN'T REMEMBER IF HE WAS SUPPOSED 
TO BE MY BROTHER'S BEST MAN BECAUSE 
MY FATHER IS DEAD L. CAN'T REMEMBER 
WHAT MY BROTHER SAID ABOUT IT BUT 
THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT HE WAS ALL 
SET TO BE THERE FOR THE WEDDING AND 
HE DIDN'T TURN UP 
THAT WAS THE 
LAST TIME SEEN OR HEARD FROM HIM 
YES 
NO NO OTHER NAMES HE USES THAT YES YOU ARE AWARE OF 
MY MUM THINKS HE 
MIGHT HAVE CHANGED HIS NAME TO 
THOMPSON HIS LAST FOSTER FAMILY 
GRAHAM IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE CASE 
BUT HE KNOWS THAT PENNY'S SEARCH 
MAY NOT RESULT IN WHAT SHE IS 
OPENING FOR 
IF WE WERE TO LOCATE 
HIM THEN THE ONLY THING I COULD 
TELL HER IS HE IS ALIVE L. COULDN'T TELL HER WHERE UNLESS HE AGREED HE 
COULD PASS THE INFORMATION ON TO 
HER IT IS NOT THAT EASY BECAUSE 
YOU TEND TO FIND THAT IF SOMEONE 
DISAPPEARS FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME 
WITHOUT ANY CONTACT AT ALL THAT IT 
IS MORE DELIBERATE ACT 
OVER HALF 
OF PEOPLE WHO GO MISSING DUE TO 
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS DECIDE THEY 
DON'T WANT CONTACT WITH THEIR 
FAMILIES AGAIN 
DAVID AND PENNY TO BE CLOSE 
GROWING UP THEY WERE PEAS IN A POD 
MY MEMORIES OF DAVID WHEN I WAS 
LITTLE WAS US TERRORISING THE PLACE 
BUILDING DENS AND CAMPS CLIMBING 
TREES NOT BEING ABLE TO GET BACK 
DOWN AGAIN 
THE SUDDEN DEATH OF 
THEIR DAD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE CHANGED 
EVERYTHING HIS MUM COULDN'T COPE 
WITH LOCKING AFTER THE FOUR INR 
YOUNG CHILDREN ON HER OWN 
LOOKING AFTER THE FOUR YOUNG 
CHILDREN ON HER OWN FRPL MY TWO 
BROTHERS WENT INTO CARE AND MY 
SISTER WENT TO LIVE WITH MY AUNT L. 
STAYED AT HOME WITH MY MUM L. SAW 
DAVID NOT AS OFTEN AS YOU KNOW I 
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAD WHEN I WAS 
LITTLE BECAUSE HE WAS IN A 
CHILDREN'S HOME HE WOULD COME HOME 
MAYBE FOR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS OR WE 
WOULD VISIT HIM AND THEN HE WENT TO 
STAY WITH FOSTER PARENTS AND THEN 
WE WOULD SEE HIM A BIT MORE AT 
ONLY SEVEN HE HAD LOST THE TWO 
MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN HIS LIFE 
I THINK THAT WHEN DAVID WENT INTO 
CARE THAT WAS PROBABLY QUITE HARD 
FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WAS AT AN AGE 
WHERE HE IS NOW BUILDING A 
RELATIONSHIP AND A BOND WITH HIS 
FATHER AND HIS FATHER IS JUST 
TAKEN AWAY YES I THINK IT DID HIT 
HIM QUITE HARD AND I KNOW I KNOW 
THAT OVER THE YEARS HE HASN'T 
QUITE LET GO OF HIS FATHER BEING 
LOST 
SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LOST REPORTED MISSING TURN UP WITHIN TWO 
DAYS BUT THE SEARCHES THAT GO ON 
FOR LONGER LIKE DAVID'S ARE 
CONSIDERABLY HARDER TO SOLVE DAVE 
BREWSTER IS WORKING WITH GRAHAM 
PALMER ON HIS CASE THEY ARE 
FOLLOWING LONG PAPER TRAIL TO SEE 
IF DAVID APPEARS ON ANY OFFICIAL 
RECORDS 
WE DO SOME BASIC INQUIRIES RECORDS WE WOULD DO FOR ANY MISSING PERSONS 
INQUIRY STRAIGHT AWAY I THINK 
GRAHAM WILL DO SOME INQUIRIES WITH 
BIRTH DEATHS AND MARRIAGES TO SEE 
IF HE HAS PASSED AWAY AND WE WILL 
TRY SOME BASIC STUFF ROUND THE 
PASSPORT OFFICE AND DRIVING 
LICENSES AND SO ON 
IT IS LABORIOUS 
WORK BUT CRUCIAL TO A LONG TERM 
CASE LIKE THIS PENNY MOVED ROUND A 
LOT BEFORE SETTLING IN LONDON AND 
BEFORE SHE LOST CONTACT WITH DAVID 
THIRTEEN YEARS AGO HE WAS LIVING IN 
OXFORDSHIRE 
THE LAST TIME I SAW OXFORDSHIRE HIM I WAS IN THE LAKE DISTRICT FOR 
A YEAR I CAME BACK DOWN AND STAYED 
WITH MY M. U. P. L. WAS THERE FOR A FEW 
WEEKS AND HE CAME OVER AND MUM 
AND I WAS LIKE NINETEEN I THINK OR EIGHTEEN 
AND THAT WAS VERY BRIEF AND THAT 
WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM 
HIM LATER ON MISSING LIVE AFTER 
DOZENS OF CALLS THEY ARE CLOSING 
IN ON DAVID BUT IS HE ALIVE AND 
WILL HE AGREE TO SPEAK TO HIS 
SISTER 
O. K. TAKE CARE BYE NOW GOT SISTER A NUMBER FOR THE GIRLFRIEND 
AND WE 
WILL RETURN TO PENNY'S SEARCH LATER 
BUT FIRST YOUR HELP IS NEEDED TO 
FIND SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BING WU SHE HAS 
BEEN MISSING FROM LOUGHBOROUGH

WE HAD THE CASE 
YESTERDAY OF LEANN SEYCHELL WHO HAD 
BEEN MISSING SINCE MARCH THIS YEAR 
WE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY SHE HADN'T 
RETURNED WHICH WAS SHE HAS 
RETURNED WHICH IS GREAT NEWS 
UNFORTUNATELY SHE HAS GONE MISSING 
AGAIN SO WE ARE MAKING A FRESH 
APPEAL TODAY FOR LEANN 
THAT IS NOT 
GOOD NEWS AT ALL BUT IS THAT 
COMMON 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE COMMON SOME YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DO RUNWAY 
REPEATEDLY OUR EXPERIENCE AT 
MISSING PEOPLE WITH THE HELPLINE 
THEY WILL REPEATEDLY MAKE CONTACT 
US WITH AND THAT IS WHAT WE 
ENCOURAGE ANY MISSING YOUNG PERSON 
TO DO 
YOU MENTIONED THE HELPLINE 
HOW CAN THAT HELP YOUNG PEOPLE IF IF SOMEONE CALLS INTO THE HELPLINE 
THEY KNOW THAT THE CALL CAN'T BE 
TRACED IT'S A CONFIDENTIAL CALL 
WE WILL TALK THROUGH THE SITUATION 
WITH THEM WE UNDERSTAND THE 
REASONS PEOPLE GO MISSING SO WE ARE 
THERE TO EMFATHIES WITH THEM BUT WE 
HELP THEM GET BACK IN TOUCH MAYBE 
PASSING ON A MESSAGE MAYBE HELPING 
THEM TALK TO THE POLICE THERE ARE 
LOTS OF THINGS WE CAN DO 
IS THERE 
ANY OTHER SUPPORT YOU CAN OFFER 
TEENAGERS 
THERE ARE A LIMITED TEENAGERS NUMBER OF SAFE PLACES FOR PEOPLE 
WHO RUNWAY THERE AREN'T MANY 
REFUGES SO A LOT IS ABOUT LINGING 
BACK TO PEOPLE THEY ARE IN TOUCH 
WITH BUT THAT MIGHT BE A SOCIAL 
WORKER OR A POLICE OFFICER 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YOU HAVE 
MENTIONED IT IS CONFIDENTIAL SO IF 
PEOPLE DO WANT TO CALL THE HELPLINE 
IF THEY REALLY REALLY DON'T WANT TO 
SAY WHERE THEY ARE THEN THE MAIN 
THING I GUESS IS TO SAY THEY ARE 
SAFE AND WELL SO IN LEANN'S CASE I 
HOPE THAT IS WHAT SHE DOES THAT 
NUMBER IS 
ANOTHER PERSON WE NEED YOUR HELP TO 
FIND IS SEVENTY TWO YEAR OLD ED ED EDWARD

CHRISTMAS EVE WITH HIS FRIENDS 
THEY HAD BEEN DRINKING IN GREENWICH 
AND THEIR PLAN WAS TO GO ICE 
SKATING THERE TOGETHER AS A GROUP 
JOSH LEFT THE PUB ON HIS OWN FOR 
NO APPARENT REASON HE WAS 
VULNERABLE BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN

THE NEXT DAY HIS FAMILY RECEIVE A 
CALL THE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN HAS 
BEEN FOUND IN THE THAMES JUST FOUR 
MILES EAST OF GREENWICH 
THROUGH D. 
IN FACT A TESTING THE BODY WE

THAT OF JOSH BEASLEY AT THAT STAGE 
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO 
JOSH WE STILL HAD UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS AND IN STACK WE STILL DO 
HAVE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW 
WE GOT INTO THE RIVER AND WHAT 
HAPPENED TO HIM 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
OF JOSH'S DEATH REMAIN A MYSTERY 
AND JOSH'S MUM IS HERE WITH US NOW 
I IS TOUGH FOR YOU WATCHING THAT

WHAT WAS THAT LIKE 
IT WAS AMAZING 
REALLY WE DID IT BECAUSE WE WANTED 
TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO 
HELPED TRY AND FIND JOSH AND ALSO 
JUST TO GIVE A SPACE A OPPORTUNITY 
FOR ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO GET TOGETHER 
TO CELEBRATE HIS LIFE SO IT WAS 
QUITE AMAZING REALLY WE HAD LOTS 
OF YOUNG PEOPLE CAME AND PLAYED 
MUSIC DID POEM PEOPLE TALKED 
ABOUT HIM AND IT WAS A REALLY GOOD 
TRIBUTE TO HIM 
I KNOW DURING THE 
TIME HE WAS MISSING YOU WERE REALLY 
PROACTIVE IN THE SEARCH FOR HIM 
DID YOU FEEL YOU HAD TO DO THAT I I DON'T KNOW I THINK JOSH WASN'T A 
TYPICAL RUNWAY HE HADN'T RUNWAY 
OUR STANCE WAS WELL WHAT CAN WE 
DO THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS 
TRY AND FIND YOUR SON AND IT 
WASN'T JUST US YOU KNOW YOUNG 
PEOPLE WERE OUT LOOKING FOR HIM ON 
CHRISTMAS DAY A LOT OF HIS FRIENDS 
WERE DOING THAT ALL THE TIME GOING 
OUT POSTERING TALKING TO PEOPLE 
ON THE INTERNET TRYING TO FIND HIM 
AND LOTS OF OUR FRIENDS AND THE 
COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE PULLED 
TOGETHER TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED 
TO THEM 
THEY WERE OUT THERE YOU 
WERE OUT THERE WITH PHOTOGRAPHS AND 
THE REST OF IT WEREN'T YOU 
WE HAD 
WHOLE GROUPS OF PEOPLE GOING OUT 
WITH POSTER PUTTING THEM UP ACROSS 
SOUTH EAST LONDON AND IT WAS YOU 
KNOW EVERYBODY WAS DESPERATE TO 
TRY AND FIND HIM 
O. K. AND ON THAT 
NIGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE SO WHAT 
YOU WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT IF 
ANYBODY ELSE HAD SEEN HIM 
YES THE 
SIGHTING YOU HAVE MENED ON THE FILM 
WAS AT ROMNEY ROAD AT THE BUS STOP 
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL ONE 
BY A PUB BUT AFTER THAT WE DON'T 
KNOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT INTO 
THE RIVER WHEN HE GOT INTO THE 
RIVER WHERE HE GOT INTO THE RIVER 
AND I MEAN WE FEEL IT HAPPENED IN 
THEY'RE THAT AREA THE GREENWICH 
AREA BUT HE JUST THERE ARE NO 
OTHER SIGHTINGS OF HIM 
AND PEOPLE 
WATCHING THIS MORNING MIGHT THINK 
GREENWICH IS A TOURIST AREA BUT 
GIVEN IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE THERE THERE WERE A LOT OF LOCAL PEOPLE PEOPLE 
WERE COMING BACK FROM WORK THERE 
IS PEOPLE COMING OUT OF CHURCHES 
FROM CHURCH SERVICE THERE ARE A 
LOT OF LOCAL PEOPLE AND I MEAN 
JOSH WAS HEADING OFF TOWARD THE ICE 
RINK AND DID GO INTO THE ICE RINK 
AND A LOT OF LOCAL PEOPLE GO THERE 
AS WELL SO YES THERE ARE SOME 
TOURISTS BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE A 
LOT OF LOCAL PEOPLE 
WHAT YOU WANT 
TO KNOW IF ANYBODY KNOWS ANYTHING 
TO GET IN CONTACT YOU WANT TO KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MISSING HOURS 
WE DO AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE NO 
IDEA HOW HE ENDED UP IN THAT RIVER 
I THINK THE FEELING IS IT HAPPENED 
THAT NIGHT ON CHRISTMAS EVE BUT 
WE HAVE NO NO IDEA AT ALL ABOUT 
HOW WHERE OR WHEN THAT HAPPENED SO 
ANY SIGHTINGS OF HIM IN GREENWICH 
THAT EVENING WOULD BE APPRECIATED 
AND WE KNOW THAT THE POLICE 
PARTICULARLY HAVE BEEN REALLY 
STRUCK BUT HOW STRONG YOU 
PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN THROUGH ALL OF 
THIS NOW WHEN YOU ARE AT THIS 
STAGE WHY IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW 
AND IS IT THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED 
IT IS PARTLY THERE 
IS A NEED TO KNOW YOU KNOW I 
THINK EVERYBODY NEEDS TO HAVE 
REASONS WHY SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED 
AND IT IS FOR PEACE OF MIND YOU 
WANT TO KNOW YOU DID HE DIDN'T 
SUFFER SOMETHING DIDN'T DO 
SOMETHING TO HIM YOU NEED TO BE 
ABLE TO DISCOUNT CERTAIN THINGS 
AND A LOT OF IT IS IT IS SUCH AN 
EXCEPTIONAL THING THAT HAPPENED YOU 
NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED THAT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
I WOULD 
HELP US COME TO TERMS WITH IT A BIT
