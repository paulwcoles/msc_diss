WELCOME TO THIS BITE SIZED VERSION OF FOOTBALL GAFFES GALORE 
LOADS OF CLIPS OF FOOTBALLERS MAKING FOOLS OF THEMSELVES 
STARTING WITH THE TOP SEVEN PLAYERS WITH TWO LEFT FEET 
WHY MUST I ALWAYS PLAY THE CLOWN 
IT DOESN'T MEAN LITERALLY 
IT'S AN EXPRESSION THAT MEANS YOU'RE CLUMSY OR UNGAINLY 
MIND YOU MY UNCLE BARRY DID HAVE TWO LEFT FEET LITERALLY 
HE'D SET OFF FOR WORK 
AND ARRIVE AT THE HOUSE SIX STEPS LATER 
HE HAD TO WORK FROM HOME IN THE END 
OFF THE LINE NO IT'S IN 
IT'S IN 
GORDON STRACHAN ON THE LINE 
TWO LEFT FEET 
STRACHAN'S GOT MORE LEFT FEET 
THAN A MILLIPEDE CARRYING A BAG OF ARTIFICIAL LEFT FEET 
PSV WAS ORIGINALLY FORMED 
AS SPORTING RECREATION FOR EMPLOYEES OF PHILIPS ELECTRICAL 
HANG ON I BOUGHT MY WASHING MACHINE OFF THAT BLOKE 
VAZ TE HE'S ONSIDE 
HE COULD WIN IT 
VAZ TE COULD HAVE WON THIS FOR BOLTON 
APPARENTLY HE WON THE PORTUGUESE VERSION OF STRICTLY COME DANCING 
WHEN HE WAS JUST SIXTEEN 
MIND YOU STRACHAN CAME SECOND 
ROBIN VAN PERSIE STILL VAN PERSIE OH 
CALAMITY 
GREAT TURN 
IF HE'D CONNECTED WITH THAT BALL 
VAN PERSIE WOULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE 
AS IT WAS HE SHATTERED HIS OWN BOTTOM 
AND HERE'S KEVIN FRANCIS 
MISSED IT COMPLETELY AND SO DID JAMIE COOK 
WHAT A DOUBLE MISS 
THESE GUYS HAVE TAKEN A BUNG HAVEN'T THEY 
ONE OF THEM WAS ONCE 
STOCKPORT COUNTY PLAYER OF THE CENTURY 
THAT'S CALLED DAMNING WITH FAINT PRAISE 
A BIT LIKE BEING EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH IN AN ICE CREAM VAN 
PLUCKY MINNOWS BURNLEY WERE THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND OF THE F. A. CUP 
THANKS TO THIS HOWLER FROM TRAORE 
AND TRAORE HAS PUT IT THROUGH HIS OWN NET 
EVEN THEIR BEST KNOWN FAN ALISTAIR CAMPBELL 
COULDN'T PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON THAT MISTAKE 
THE TOP FIVE SORRY SPOT KICKS 
WOULD YOU WANT TO BE CHRIS WADDLE NOW 
AND ENGLAND ARE OUT OF THE WORLD CUP 
CHRIS WADDLE GETS UNDER IT A BIT 
AS MY OLD MAN USED TO SAY 
WHEN THAT COMES DOWN IT'LL HAVE SNOW ON IT 
LEE DIXON 
WHEN THIS ONE CAME DOWN IT HAD OZONE ON IT 
PAT NEVIN DECIDES TO BLAST IT 
HE CONTRACTS RICKETS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT TO STRIKE THE BALL 
NEVIN OH DEAR OH DEAR I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
LINEKER FINDS THAT HAVING A GOLDEN BOOT CAN ACTUALLY WEAR YOU DOWN 
OH DEAR ME 
HE ABSOLUTELY FLUFFED IT 
UNLESS YOU'RE PLAYING A MIDGET ELEVEN 
NEVER TRY TO CHIP THE KEEPER WITH A PENALTY 
WAS THAT A TOUCH OF GENEROSITY 
EXTRAORDINARY WAY TO TAKE A PENALTY 
NOW THE TOP SEVEN CARELESS HANDS 
IN WORLD WAR ONE THERE WAS A SAYING 
CARELESS TALK COSTS LIVES 
IN FOOTBALL THERE'S A SAYING TOO 
CARELESS HANDS COST GOALS 
GREAT CORNER GREAT HEADER GREAT SAVE 
OH YOU DIV 
OH IT'S A MISTAKE BY THE GOALKEEPER 
AND RUDI VOELLER FOLLOWED IN 
CAN'T BLAME THE KEEPER HERE 
VOELLER'S MULLET IS BEARING DOWN ON HIM LIKE A HEAD MOUNTED FERRET 
THAT'S ENOUGH TO PUT ANYONE OFF 
THE SOCCEROOS KEEPER WAS KNOWN AS SPIDER 
IN THE DRESSING ROOM HE COULDN'T GET OUT OF THE BATH 
AN AWFUL ERROR FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOALKEEPER 
AND HE ATE FLIES AND REGURGITATED HIS FOOD 
I MADE THAT UP TO BE HONEST I HAD TO THE TRUTH IS PRETTY BORING 
HE'S GOT EIGHT LEGS 
OH AND DROPPED COMPLETELY BY BROWN 
YEARS LATER BROWN LET IN TEN GOALS IN ONE GAME AGAINST GILLINGHAM 
HERE HE IS GETTING A BIT OF PRACTISE IN 
SCOTLAND ROMPED HOME TWO TO ZERO AGAINST THIS ULTRA MOBILE ZAIRE TEAM 
AND THROUGH THE GOALKEEPER TWO TO ZERO 
LET'S SEE THAT AGAIN 
I'VE SEEN SUBBUTEO PLAYERS REACT QUICKER THAN THAT 
DALGLISH TWISTS TURNS 
THE SHOT IS NOTHING SPECIAL BUT WATCH THE GUY BEHIND THE GOAL 
ONE CAN ONLY FEEL DESPAIR FOR RAY CLEMENCE 
HIS JOB IS TO MEASURE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN RAY CLEMENCE'S LEGS 
THERE IT IS 
SIX FEET TWO INCHES A NEW WORLD RECORD 
GARY SPRAKE FORGETS THE LAWS OF GRAVITY 
WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN 
AND A GOAL 
AND SPRAKE FURIOUS WITH HIMSELF 
AS INDEED HE OUGHT TO BE 
THINK OF YOUR OWN CAREER IF IT HELPS GARY 
AND NOW OUR FINAL CATEGORY THE TOP SIX NOT SO FANCY DANS 
SHOWING OFF ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD IS GREAT WHEN IT WORKS 
BUT IF IT GOES WRONG YOU'RE IN TROUBLE 
HE'S IN TROUBLE 
NEATLY FORWARD FOR ROBERTO BAGGIO 
BAGGIO ENGLAND'S PENALTY COACH 
APPLYING FOR THE JOB OF SKILLS COACH TOO 
ALTHOUGH THE POSITION WAS HOTLY CONTESTED BY LAURENT ROBERT 
AND TONY POPOVIC 
FLICKED ON OH IT'S AN OWN GOAL FROM POPOVIC 
THAT WAS HIS AUDITION TAPE 
DEAR OH DEAR 
A VERY UNFORTUNATE MOMENT FOR DAVID DUNN 
DAVID DUNN WAS NICKNAMED THE NEW GAZZA 
PRESUMABLY COS HE WAS SLOSHED 
HERE'S CROUCH 
AT NUMBER ONE IT'S PETER CROUCH 
EVERYONE KNOWS HE'S SIX FEET SEVEN INCHES 
BUT IT'S A LITTLE KNOWN FACT THAT CROUCH IS MADE ENTIRELY OUT OF GOLF CLUBS
