MATHS CHANNEL 
THE CHANNEL YOU CAN COUNT ON 
THIS PROGRAMME IS ABOUT SUBTRACTION AS THE OPPOSITE OF ADDITION 
IF YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT ADDITION YOU'LL FIND SUBTRACTION EASY 
IN FACT SUBTRACTING IS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF ADDING 
EVERY DAY WE ADD THINGS AND TAKE THEM AWAY 
CAKES ONTO A PLATE 
A DRINK FROM A GLASS 
OR LIBRARY BOOKS PLACED ON A SHELF 
AND TAKEN AWAY AGAIN TO BE READ 
TO HELP US SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SUBTRACTION AND ADDITION 
WE CAN FOLLOW THIS GIRL AS SHE TRAVELS IN A LIFT 
SHE GETS IN ON FLOOR NUMBER ONE AND GOES UP ONE FLOOR 
THE GIRL DECIDES TO GO BACK DOWN ONE FLOOR 
SHE ENDS UP EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS BEFORE 
UP ONE DOWN ONE 
BACK TO WHERE SHE STARTED 
FIRST FLOOR 
MATHS CHANNEL 
THESE MAGIC JUMPING BOOTS 
CAN ALSO SHOW US WHAT HAPPENS 
WHEN THEY JUMP ON AND BACK THE SAME NUMBER 
THE BOY JUMPS ON THREE 
AND THEN JUMPS BACK THREE 
AND ENDS UP EXACTLY WHERE HE STARTED 
CHELSEA'S NOW GETTING INTO THE LIFT ON FLOOR THREE 
AND GOES DOWN TWO FLOORS 
IF SHE GOES STRAIGHT BACK UP TWO FLOORS 
SHE ENDS UP EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS BEFORE ON FLOOR THREE 
MATHS CHANNEL 
AND THE BOY WITH THE MAGIC JUMPING BOOTS IS NOW STARTING ON SIX 
AND INSTEAD OF JUMPING ON THIS TIME HE JUMPS BACK FOUR 
AND THEN HE JUMPS ON FOUR 
AND ENDS UP EXACTLY WHERE HE STARTED 
SO IF YOU TAKE AWAY FOUR THEN ADD FOUR 
YOU END UP EXACTLY AS BEFORE 
IF YOU ADD SOMETHING ON 
THEN TAKE IT AWAY 
DO YOU END UP WITH LESS OR MORE 
YOU GET A CAKE 
AND NOW IT'S GONE 
YOU END UP EXACTLY AS BEFORE 
GO DOWN TWO FLOORS 
THEN UP TWO FLOORS 
DO YOU END UP ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR 
GO DOWN TWO FLOORS 
THEN UP TWO FLOORS 
YOU END UP EXACTLY AS BEFORE 
YOU CAN ADD IT ON 
TAKE THE SAME AWAY 
OR TAKE IT FIRST 
ADD THE SAME STRAIGHTAWAY 
WHICHEVER WAY ROUND 
YOU CAN BE SURE 
YOU END UP EXACTLY AS BEFORE 
IF YOU JUMP BACK FOUR 
THEN JUMP ON FOUR 
THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN BE SURE 
IF YOU JUMP BACK FOUR 
THEN JUMP ON FOUR 
YOU END UP EXACTLY AS BEFORE 
YOU CAN ADD IT ON 
TAKE THE SAME AWAY 
OR TAKE IT FIRST 
ADD THE SAME STRAIGHTAWAY

IT DOESN'T MATTER ADDING MATCHES SUBTRACTING 
SUBTRACTING MATCHES ADDING 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK HOW THIS CAN BE USEFUL WHEN WE'RE SHOPPING 
THIS BOY PETER IS THINKING ABOUT BUYING A BOOK 
AND HE'S WORKING OUT HOW MUCH MONEY HE'LL HAVE LEFT 
HE'S GOT FIVE TO SPEND 
HE'S BUYING A BOOK FOR THREE 
THAT WILL TAKE THREE AWAY FROM HIS FIVE 
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL THAT LEAVE HIM 
WELL FIVE TAKE AWAY THREE LEAVES 
TWO 
THAT'S THREE PLEASE 
THANK YOU 
TWO CHANGE 
NOW PETER'S CHECKING HIS CHANGE 
HE STARTED WITH FIVE SPENT THREE WHICH LEAVES HIM WITH TWO CHANGE 
SO TWO CHANGE PLUS A BOOK THAT'S WORTH THREE 
BRINGS HIM BACK TO THE FIVE HE STARTED WITH 
THIS BOY TYRELL HAS DECIDED TO BUY A SKATEBOARD COSTING FIVE 
THEN HE THINKS HE MIGHT BUY A TENNIS SET AS WELL COSTING FOUR 
SO FIVE ADD FOUR WOULD MAKE NINE ALTOGETHER 
BUT HE DECIDES THAT NINE IS TOO MUCH 
AND SO DECIDES NOT TO BUY THE TENNIS SET FOR FOUR 
HE'S BACK TO SPENDING JUST FIVE 
BACK TO WHERE HE STARTED
