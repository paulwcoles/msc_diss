DAWN BREAKS ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE QUEST 
OF THE ORIGINAL EIGHTEEN ONLY THESE TWO BRAVE WARRIORS REMAIN 
AT THE END OF THE DAY ONLY ONE WILL EMERGE VICTORIOUS 
MY FRIENDS 
YOU MUST TURN YOUR THOUGHTS NOW TO THE FINAL DAY'S TASKS 
WHICH OF YOU WILL BE MORE WORTHY TO BECOME THE ULTIMATE CHAMPION 
I'M HOPING THAT BY THE END OF TODAY I CAN BECOME THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR 
BECAUSE IT'S JUST SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WANTED 
AND I JUST REALLY REALLY HOPE THAT TODAY WILL BE MY DAY 
I REALLY WANT TO BE NAMED ULTIMATE CHAMPION 
COS I'VE NEVER WANTED SOMETHING LIKE THIS AS MUCH BEFORE 
AND IT WOULD BE BRILLIANT TO HAVE BEATEN SEVENTEEN OTHER WARRIORS 
TO THE TITLE 
YOUR COURAGE STRENGTH AND WISDOM HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE 
BUT MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST ALONG THE WAY 
HANSO SIX LIVES AND SIX RINGS 
VERSAD WITH FIVE LIVES AND SIX RINGS 
YOU'RE CLOSE BEHIND BUT LIKE THE TREE THAT IS YOUR SYMBOL 
YOU MUST REACH HIGHER STILL TO SECURE THE PRIZE 
COME NOW MY FRIENDS THE STAFF OF POWER BECKONS 
WARRIORS 
ONCE AGAIN WE APPROACH THE BLASTED MOUNTAIN 
AN AWESOME PROSPECT 
AND ONE THAT FILLS MANY A WARRIOR WITH DREAD 
STEEL YOURSELVES VERSAD HANSO 
AS ONCE MORE WE VENTURE INSIDE THIS FIERY GIANT 
COME 
NOW WE MUST WALK AGAIN 
THE SECRET PATH THAT TAKES US DEEP INTO THE HEART OF THIS VOLCANO 
TO SECURE MORE RINGS AND TEST YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR FORTITUDE 
MY FRIENDS THE MOUNTAIN ROARS ITS DISAPPROVAL QUICKLY INSIDE 
MY FRIENDS THESE DARK AND SMOULDERING CAVES 
HAVE LURED MANY A TRAVELLER TO THEIR DOOM 
WE MUST BE VERY WARY 
THIS NARROW BRIDGE MUST BE CROSSED BY EACH OF YOU IN TURN 
AND YOU MUST COLLECT THE GOLD RINGS ALONG THE WAY 
BUT REMEMBER THE MOUNTAIN WILL TRY ITS UTMOST 
TO SHAKE YOU FROM THE BEAM 
THE MOMENT YOU TAKE YOUR FIRST STEP 
HANSO AS OUR LEADER 
YOU WILL GO FIRST 
HANSO TAKE ONLY COURAGE WITH YOU NOW 
AS YOU PREPARE TO CROSS THIS TREACHEROUS BEAM 
LEAVE ALL DOUBT BEHIND 
ARE YOU READY 
THEN 
THE MOUNTAIN SHOWS ITS EVIL INTENT 
BY SHAKING THE BEAM THE WARRIOR IS ATTEMPTING TO CROSS' 
BECAUSE I'M NOW BACK UNDER BLASTED MOUNTAIN 
I FEEL QUITE ANNOYED 
BECAUSE LAST TIME I WAS HERE I LOST ALL FOUR CHALLENGES 
AND NOW I'M BACK 
VERSAD 
THE CHASM HAS CLAIMED YET ANOTHER VICTIM 
BUT WILL YOU SUCCUMB 
ARE YOU READY 
THEN LET THE CHALLENGE 
BEGIN 
I THINK I SHOULD'VE CHANGED MY STRATEGY 
BECAUSE MY STRATEGY WAS TO GO SIDEWAYS TO GET THE RINGS 
I SHOULD'VE JUST TRIED TO GO FORWARDS 
COS IT MAY HAVE MADE ME STRONGER 
I WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED I FELL BECAUSE I KNEW IF I'D WON 
I'D BE IN FIRST PLACE BUT HANSO LOST TOO SO POSITIONS ARE JUST THE SAME 
THE WARRIORS HAVE FALLEN AT THE VERY FIRST OF THIS MOUNTAIN'S CHALLENGES 
THEY MUST BE RESCUED FROM THE VOLCANIC VAULTS BENEATH US 
AND QUICKLY 
HANSO VERSAD AT THIS GAPING CHASM 
YOU CONTROLLED NEITHER YOUR FEAR NOR YOUR BALANCE 
I EXPECTED MORE OF A CHAMPION WARRIOR 
OBVIOUSLY YOU BOTH STILL HAVE MUCH TO PROVE 
YOUR FAILURE WILL COST YOU EACH A LIFE 
THE WRATH OF THIS MOUNTAIN TAKES MANY FORMS 
LET US JOURNEY ON TO THE NEXT OF ITS FIERY CHALLENGES 
COME 
WARRIORS THOUGH THIS TUNNEL MAY SEEM BLOCKED 
WE KNOW IT IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD 
REMEMBER MOVE THE BOULDER TO THE FAR END OF THE TUNNEL 
AND YOU WILL MAKE GOOD YOUR ESCAPE 
ASE YOU PASS THROUGH THE PASSAGE WAY 
THERE ARE GOLD RINGS TO COLLECT 
BUT TAKE CARE 
FOR THIS TUNNEL IS A TRAP FOR THE UNWARY 
IT HAS MANY SURPRISES 
VERSAD I CHOOSE YOU TO GO FIRST 
REMEMBER IN THIS PLACE THE MOUNTAIN CAN ATTACK WITHOUT WARNING 
BE ON YOUR GUARD AT ALL TIMES 
ARE YOU READY 
THE TASK FACING VERSAD IS TO PUSH THE BOULDER IN FRONT OF HIM 
WHILST ATTEMPTING TO FIND THE RINGS HIDDEN WITHIN THE TUNNEL 
BUT THERE IS DANGER ALSO 
AS VERSAD IS ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
TAKING THE FIRST RING HAS ALERTED THE DEMON TO YOUR PRESENCE 
HE WILL PURSUE YOU RELENTLESSLY VERSAD 
BUT YOU MUST ESCAPE THE TUNNEL WITH ALL THREE RINGS 
VERSAD YOU HAVE OPENED THE SECRET DOOR OUT OF THE TUNNEL 
BUT YOU MUST FIND THE THIRD RING BEFORE YOU CAN MAKE YOUR ESCAPE 
LAST TIME I ONLY JUST GOT OUT WITH TWO RINGS 
BUT THIS TIME I HAD TO GET ALL THREE 
SO I WAS REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT WHETHER I'D DO IT OR NOT 
HANSO VERSAD HAS TRIUMPHED IN THE BOULDER RUN 
WILL YOU MATCH HIM 
ARE YOU READY 
IN YOUR HASTE HANSO DO NOT FORGET YOU MUST FIND ALL THREE RINGS 
BEFORE YOU CAN SAFELY EXIT THE TUNNEL 
THE DEMON HAS STARTED HIS PURSUIT BEWARE 
YOU HAVE FOUND THE SECOND RING HANSO BUT THE DEMON IS GAINING 
HANSO YOU HAVE DROPPED A RING YOU NEED ALL THREE 
JUST BEFORE THE END OF THE CHALLENGE I GOT THE THIRD RING 
AND I PUT IT ON MY ROCK AND THEN I COULDN'T FIND THE EXIT 
IN THE PANIC AND STRUGGLE I LOST ONE OF THE RINGS 
I AM REALLY REALLY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED WITH MYSELF 
BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A SILLY MISTAKE TO MAKE 
AT SUCH A VITAL TIME IN THE COMPETITION 
VERSAD THE GOLD IS CONSTANTLY USED TO ENSNARE UNWARY TRAVELLERS 
IN THIS INFERNAL PLACE 
HOWEVER YOU BRAVED THE FURY OF THIS VOLCANO AND ESCAPED WITH TREASURE 
PLACE IT ON YOUR STANDARD 
YOUR HOARD OF NINE GOLDEN RINGS CAN BE EXCHANGED FOR A PRECIOUS LIFE 
HANSO THOUGH YOU FOUND ALL THREE RINGS IN YOUR HASTE 
YOU DROPPED ONE 
THAT WAS A COSTLY MISTAKE 
NOW IT IS TIME TO HEAD TO THE HEART OF THIS GIANT 
WHERE ONCE AGAIN YOU WILL FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF ITS ANGER 
FOLLOW ME 
THE MOUNTAIN'S POWER EMANATES FROM THE HOT LAVA YOU SEE BEFORE YOU NOW 
THOUGH THERE ARE TWO DOORWAYS ONLY ONE WILL REVEAL THE WAY OUT 
FOR ONCE THE FIRST DOOR IS OPENED IT WILL TRIGGER AN ERUPTION 
THAT WILL IMMEDIATELY ENGULF THE WARRIOR WHO REMAINS BEHIND 
SPEED IS ESSENTIAL IN THIS CHALLENGE 
AND THE PENALTY FOR FAILURE IS SEVERE 
ARE YOU READY 
THE TASK BEFORE THE WARRIORS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD 
PLACE A SKULL ON EACH OF THE SHELVES SURROUNDING THEIR EXIT DOOR 
THE FIRST TO DO SO WILL ESCAPE THE WRATH OF THE MOUNTAIN 
I WAS QUITE CONFIDENT GOING INTO THE LAVA PIT 
BECAUSE I WON IT THE LAST TIME AND I KNEW THE TECHNIQUES TO USE 
BUT I GOT A BIT WORRIED AT ONE POINT COS HANSO STARTED TO TAKE THE LEAD 
WHEN VERSAD GOT AHEAD OF ME I DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE 
COS I WAS ON MY SEVENTH OR EIGHTH SKULL AND I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF 
ONLY TWO MORE TO GO 
THEN I LOOKED UP AND NOTICED HE WAS PUTTING IN HIS TENTH 
SO I KNEW THERE WAS NO CHANCE AFTER THAT 
AT THE START OF THE DAY I WAS ONE LIFE BEHIND HANSO 
AND IT LOOKED LIKE SHE COULD BE GOING INTO THE LAST STAND LEADING 
BUT I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE ONE LIFE AND FIVE RINGS AHEAD OF HER 
WITH ONE CHALLENGE TO GO 
VERSAD TWO GOLD RINGS ARE YOURS 
PLACE THEM ON YOUR STANDARD 
NOW FOR YOUR COMRADE 
HANSO THE FIERY BREATH OF THIS VOLCANO 
IS AS FIERCE AS ANY DRAGON'S 
AS YOU HAVE DISCOVERED 
I HAVE RESTORED YOU AT A PRICE 
THE LOSS OF A PRECIOUS LIFE 
THOUGH YOU MET WITH MIXED FORTUNES HERE 
THE TIME HAS COME TO FACE YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE UNDERGROUND 
COME 
THE SENTINELS YOU SEE BEFORE YOU 
BLOCK THE EXIT FROM THIS VOLCANO 
THEY ARE CONTROLLED BY A POWER 
FAR GREATER THAN ANY YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED SO FAR 
YOU MUST DEFEAT THEM IF YOU ARE TO ESCAPE THIS PLACE 
AS BEFORE YOU MUST USE THE STONE WARRIORS THAT LIE AT YOUR FEET 
REASSEMBLE THEM AND THE POWER OF THESE STONE SOLDIERS 
WILL VANQUISH THE DEMONS THAT STAND IN YOUR WAY 
REMEMBER ONLY ONE OF YOU WILL ESCAPE THIS CAVERN 
ARE YOU READY 
VERSAD HAS SUCCEEDED IN THIS CHALLENGE BEFORE 
WHEREAS HANSO HAS STRUGGLED 
WILL IT BE THE SAME THIS TIME 
YOU SEEM LOST HANSO BUT THE SOLUTION LIES ALL AROUND YOU 
I WAS REALLY CONSCIOUS THAT HANSO WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH HER STATUE 
SO THAT GAVE ME TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT STONES I WAS PUTTING IN 
AND I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO RUSH 
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH MYSELF 
BECAUSE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING I DID HAVE THE FIRST PIECE 
I COULDN'T SLIDE IT IN 
I JUST CAN'T WIN ANY CHALLENGE UNDER BLASTED MOUNTAIN 
BECAUSE I'M GOING INTO THE LAST STAND WITH ONLY TWO LIVES 
I FEEL DISAPPOINTED WITH MYSELF 
VERSAD YOU DID WELL 
THE SOLDIER YOU REBUILT HELPED YOU ESCAPE THE CAVERN 
AND EARNED YOU TWO GOLD RINGS 
PLACE THEM ON YOUR STANDARD 
NOW FOR YOUR COMRADE 
HANSO ONCE AGAIN 
YOUR JOURNEY UNDER THE MOUNTAIN HAS NOT BEEN PRODUCTIVE 
I RESCUED YOU BUT AT A PRICE 
WARRIORS YOU HAVE ENDURED THE TRIALS OF THIS DEMONIC MOUNTAIN 
AND FELT ITS FURY 
BUT EVEN THE WRATH OF THIS VOLCANO 
CANNOT COMPARE TO THE DARK FORCES YOU MUST NOW CONFRONT 
ONCE MORE YOU MUST DO BATTLE WITH MY ARCH ENEMY 
IT IS TIME COME 
THIS IS THE LAST STAND 
HERE MANY A NOBLE WARRIOR HAS REACHED THE END OF THEIR QUEST 
DEFEATED BY THE ODIOUS CREATURE THAT HAS DOGGED OUR STEPS 
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING 
HIS NAME IS NEVAR 
HANSO VERSAD BOTH OF YOU 
SET OUT WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO BECOME THE ULTIMATE CHAMPION 
NOW THAT PRIZE IS JUST WITHIN YOUR GRASP 
BUT BEFORE YOU CLAIM IT YOU MUST PROVE YOUR WORTHINESS 
ONE LAST TIME 
REMEMBER NEVAR STANDS GUARD OVER THE MAGICAL PORTAL 
WHOEVER PASSES THROUGH IT FIRST 
WILL CLAIM THE CHAMPION'S TITLE AND WITH IT THE STAFF OF POWER 
MY FRIENDS GATHER ALL YOUR STRENGTH AND RESOLVE 
FOR YOU WILL NEED IT 
IN THIS FINAL CHALLENGE OF THE QUEST 
YOUR REMAINING LIVES ARE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE 
VERSAD YOU ARE OUR LEADER HAVING GATHERED FIVE LIVES AND FOUR RINGS 
AND AS SUCH WILL START WELL AHEAD OF YOUR FELLOW WARRIOR 
HANSO YOUR EFFORTS TODAY HAVE LEFT YOU WITH TWO LIVES AND SIX RINGS 
MAY THE LUCK OF THE RAVEN'S EYE BE WITH YOU 
THE FIRST TASK FACING THE WARRIORS IS TO DRAG A KEY ALONG THE POLE 
TO A CAGE CONTAINING PUZZLE PIECES AT THE END OF IT 
THOUGH VERSAD IS AHEAD OF YOU HANSO 
THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME TO CATCH UP 
ONCE THE WARRIORS COMPLETE THE PUZZLE 
IT'LL DESTROY THE DEMON BLOCKING THEIR PATH 
BEWARE VERSAD YOU HAVE FALLEN UNDER THE BALEFUL GLARE OF NEVAR 
TO ACCESS THE PORTAL THE SYMBOLS MUST BE CORRECTLY ALIGNED 
OUR WARRIORS STROVE BRAVELY TO REACH THE PRIZE 
BUT ONLY VERSAD WAS VICTORIOUS IN THE END 
FOR HANSO THAT GLITTERING REWARD PROVED IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTAIN 
HOWEVER SOME OF THE GLORY MUST REMAIN WITH HER 
HANSO VERY FEW HAVE ACHIEVED SO MUCH 
OR JOURNEYED SO FAR IN THIS QUEST 
THOUGH YOU MUST NOW BEGIN THE PATH HOMEWARD 
REMEMBER YOU WILL NOT BE ALONE 
BY DAY YOU MAY GLIMPSE MY SHADOW 
AND BY NIGHT YOU MAY HEAR MY CALL 
AND YOU WILL KNOW HANSO THE SPIRIT OF THE RAVEN TRAVELS WITH YOU 
FAREWELL WARRIOR 
WHILE I WAS STILL IN THE CAGE I WATCHED HIM COMPLETE THE FIRST PART 
OF THE LAST STAND AND I KNEW THAT I HAD TO WORK SO SO HARD 
TO TRY AND CATCH UP WITH HIM 
DURING THIS QUEST I'VE DONE CHALLENGES I NEVER EXPECTED TO FACE 
AND I'VE SURPRISED MYSELF AT MY STRENGTH AND MY WEAKNESSES 
AND WHAT I CAN DO AND IT'S MADE ME A STRONGER PERSON 
THE ONLY FEAR I HAD ABOUT THIS QUEST WAS GOING OUT EARLY 
AND I'VE WORKED SO HARD 
AND TO COME SECOND IS JUST SO AMAZING I'M JUST SO HAPPY 
SO WE HAVE OUR ULTIMATE CHAMPION 
LET US GO AND GREET HIM 
WARRIOR YOU HAVE REACHED THE END OF YOUR QUEST 
AS AN ULTIMATE CHAMPION 
YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WORTHY TO PURSUE YET MORE HEROIC ENDEAVOURS 
TAKE THIS YOUR STAFF OF POWER 
USE IT WISELY AND IT'LL SEE YOU SAFELY THROUGH MANY ADVENTURES 
AND REMEMBER THIS WRITE A NAME ON THE WATER 
AND IT WILL BE FORGOTTEN IN A MOMENT 
INSCRIBE ANOTHER IN THE SAND AND IT WILL BE QUICKLY WASHED AWAY 
BUT THE NAME THAT IS WRITTEN IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF WARRIORS 
WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR ALL TIME 
SUCH A NAME IS VERSAD 
SO THE SUN SETS ON THIS QUEST FOR THE FINAL TIME 
AND ANOTHER LIGHT SHINES BRIGHTLY ACROSS THIS TROUBLED LAND 
A NEW CHAMPION WALKS AMONG US NOW 
BANISHING THE DARKNESS AND BRINGING HOPE TO ALL 
FAREWELL MY FRIENDS 
COME 
MY TIME ON RAVEN HAS BEEN SO MUCH FUN 
AND IT'S JUST BEEN THE TIME OF A LIFETIME 
MY PROUDEST MOMENT ON THE QUEST WAS WHEN I DID WRESTLING RING 
AND LONG STAFF COS I HAVEN'T GOT THE BEST OF BALANCE 
AND I THOUGHT I WAS FACING STRONG PEOPLE 
AND I WON BOTH THOSE CHALLENGES SO I WAS REALLY PLEASED 
TO BE NAMED THE ULTIMATE CHAMPION MEANS THE WORLD 
BECAUSE I NEVER EXPECTED TO EVEN GET TO THE FINAL WEEK 
TO GO ON AND WIN THE COMPETITION AND BEAT SEVENTEEN OTHER WARRIORS 
IS JUST FANTASTIC 
OH
