RIGHT BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS WE COULD HAVE IT FOR FORTY 
IT IS VERY NICE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA MAKE A PROFIT 
I THINK SO BUT WHAT D'YOU THINK 
WELL I THINK AT FORTY THAT'S BRILLIANT DOWN FROM HOW MUCH 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THAT WAS LOT OF MONEY WASN'T IT 
CHAD VALLEY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MAKERS OF CHILDREN'S TOYS IN ENGLAND 
PARTICULARLY IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND THE SIXTIES AND THIS PARTICULAR ITEM DATES FROM THAT PERIOD 
WHAT I THINK'S SO GOOD ABOUT IT IS THE CONDITION 
YES IT'S ALMOST IMMACULATE ISN'T IT YEP 
THERE'S NO DAMAGE THERE'S NO SCRATCHES AND THE BOX 
OH THAT'S WONDERFUL ALL THIS JAZZY DESIGN ALL THE WAY ROUND HERE 
REMINDS ME VERY MUCH OF THE SORT OF FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN PERIOD 
WHEN PARENTS COULD INDULGE IN TOYS LIKE THIS FOR THEIR CHILDREN 
SO THIS IS A LOVELY LOVELY LITTLE COLLECTOR'S ITEM WELL SPOTTED 
IT'S GOING TO A SALE WHERE THEY HAVE ASKED FOR TOYS IN ORIGINAL BOXES SO YOU'VE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD 
AND WE DO WANT A TOY DON'T WE THERE YOU GO

NO I LIKE WOOD YOU LIKE WOOD 
YEAH I LOVE THE FEEL OF WOOD THAT'S NICE IT'S LOVELY INNIT IT IS IT IS 
IT'S BEECH IS IT YEAH 
LITTLE COLLAR BOX 
THEY USED TO WEAR STIFF COLLARS MY FATHER USED TO WEAR THEM I REMEMBER 
THIS ONE'S A BIT DIFFERENT TO THE NORM O. K. WHY'S THAT THEN DUNNO 
THIS HERE OPENS UP 
OH WOW WOW 
SO THIS IS FOR YOUR COLLARS AND THAT THERE 
STUDS IS TO PUT YOUR STUDS IN SPOT ON BRILLIANT 
WHY IS THIS WOOD DIFFERENT FROM THAT ONE NO IT'S THE SAME WOOD 
I MEAN THE PATTERN IN IT 
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT THIS IS SPALTED BEECH 
NOW IF YOU IMAGINE A GREAT BIG BEECH TREE 
DISEASE GETS INTO THE ROOTS OF THE TREE AND TRAVELLING UP THE CORE OF THE TREE O. K. 
AND SO THE INSIDE OF THE TREE IS DISEASED BUT THE OUTSIDE OF 
THE TREE ISN'T IN THAT STATE YET A WHILE 
YOU'VE GOT THIS SORT OF MARBLING EFFECT TO THE INTERIOR 
BRILLIANT WHAT'S EVEN BETTER STILL THE WAY THAT THIS IS MADE IMAGINE THIS ON A LATHE MM HMM 
AND THAT BIT OF WOOD IS SPINNING ROUND LIKE THAT 
AND HE GETS HIS CHISEL AND HE TURNS THAT INTO A CIRCLE 
NOW TURNING THAT PART IS FAIRLY EASY ISN'T IT 
BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOU CHISEL IN THERE 
INTO THERE TO MAKE IT THAT SHAPE 
THAT'S NOT STUCK ON THERE THIS IS ALL PART OF THE SAME LUMP OF WOOD BRILLIANT HOW GOOD IS THAT 
HOW MUCH IS IT I'VE HAD A WORD WITH THE DEALER ITS PRICED AT FIFTY 
HE'S KINDLY SAID THAT WE CAN HAVE IT FOR FORTY WHAT D'YOU RECKON 
SO DO YOU THINK IT WILL MAKE A PROFIT AT AUCTION 
AN ORDINARY BOG STANDARD LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY BEECH COLLAR BOX 
IS A FIVER BUT THAT JUST MAKES IT THE ROLLS ROYCE OF COLLAR BOXES 
IT'S SPECTACULAR IT IS IT'S STUNNING 
ON A BAD DAY IT'S TWENTY TO THIRTY ON A GOOD DAY IT MIGHT MAKE FORTY TO SIXTY BUT I LIKE IT 
SO ARE WE GONNA BUY IT I THINK SO 
ARE WE GONNA SEND LAURA OFF 
YOU'RE THE ONE WITH THE MONEY AREN'T YOU GONNA GO AND PAY THE DEALER YEAH O. K. THEN 
AND THE BLUES ARE OFF TO A GREAT START TOO 
FORTY PAID FOR THE COLLAR BOX 
NOW I WONDER IF SONA HAS FOUND THE REDS' NEXT ITEM 
SONA THIS IS A LITTLE BIT MASCULINE FOR YOU IT'S AS HEAVY AS ANYTHING OOH 
WHY HAVE YOU GONE FOR THIS TO BE HONEST IT ACTUALLY REMINDED ME OF MY TIME IN NIGERIA 
I'VE SEEN THESE IN THE CLUBS AND I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE 
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A VERY AFFLUENT LIFESTYLE IT WAS AN ENJOYABLE TIME YES 
SO THERE WERE CLUBS THERE WITH BILLIARD ROOMS YES 
BECAUSE THIS IS A BILLIARD SCORER IT IS 
ALTHOUGH IT HAS A SORT OF ANGLO INDIAN FEEL ABOUT IT I WOULD SAY THIS IS ENGLISH 
THIS ACTUALLY REMINDS ME OF A SCHOOL OF CARVING AT WARWICK AND THEY USED OAK 
ALL THIS CARVING HERE WHICH IS BEAUTIFULLY DONE BY HAND 
ALL THE SCROLL WORK AND THE LEAFAGE IS TYPICAL OF THEIR WORK 
AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THAT SORT OF PERIOD 
AND I THINK THIS WAS INTENDED FOR A FAIRLY WEALTHY RESIDENCE IN ENGLAND 
WHAT I LIKE FROM A DISTANCE I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ABACUS 
BECAUSE YOU CAN MOVE THESE LITTLE SECTIONS ACROSS 
I LOVE THESE WINDOWS HERE WITH THE LITTLE SORT OF 
IVORY TURNED SECTIONS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS SO IT REALLY IS NICE 
AND YOU'VE GOT THAT SLATE IN THE MIDDLE SO YOU WRITE UP YOUR SCORES 
NOW CAN YOU SEE THIS BEING USED TODAY 
I THINK SO I THINK IT WOULD BE YES 
CAROL YOU'VE SAID NOTHING WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT I ACTUALLY LIKE IT 
IT REMINDS ME OF MY FATHER'S CARPENTRY RULE 
BECAUSE HE'S A CARPENTER AND JOINER BY TRADE 
OH RIGHT ALL OF THIS FIGURE WORK IS VERY MUCH LIKE ON ALL HIS RULES AND HE WOULD LOVE ALL THE OAK 
IT'S VERY NICE INDEED NOW WHAT'S THE PRICE 
THEY ARE ASKING FOR ONE HUNDRED 
ONE HUNDRED DO YOU THINK YOU COULD NEGOTIATE IT LOWER 
I'M SURE WE CAN GET A BARGAIN OUT OF THIS 
IF YOU CAN GET THE PRICE DOWN FROM ONE HUNDRED I THINK WE STAND TO MAKE A GOOD PROFIT ON IT 
I'M SURE WE WILL TRY GOOD ONE SONA 
LET'S GO FOR IT YES NICE CHOICE 
I'LL COME WITH YOU WE'LL NEGOTIATE A DEAL ON THIS O. K. 
COME ON THANK YOU 
AFTER TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS THE REDS MANAGED TO GET TEN OFF THE BILLIARD SCORER NINETY PAID 
WELL YOU KNOW FOLKS THE TEAMS DO GET THE OPPORTUNITY OF BOOSTING THEIR PROFITS 
ANY LEFTOVER LOLLY WILL BE GIVEN TO THEIR EXPERT TO FIND A BONUS BUY WHICH WILL BE SOLD LATER AT AUCTION 
OF COURSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE EXPERT'S CHOICE 
BUT IF THEY DON'T IT'LL BE BACK TO SCHOOL AND SIX OF THE BEST 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS CHAIR 
OH IT'S GREAT WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT IS MY LITTLE GIRL WHO IS NOT SO LITTLE NOW SHE'S TWENTY FOUR 
BUT WHEN SHE WAS BORN WE BOUGHT THIS LITTLE CHILD'S CHAIR FOR HER 
AND SHE USED TO SIT IN IT BY THE FIRE AND YOU CREATE THIS FAMILY HEIRLOOM THAT GOES ON 
I THINK THAT'S GREAT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO PASS DOWN TO THE NEXT GENERATION WHY DO YOU LIKE IT 
OH I JUST LIKE IT I LIKE WOOD I LIKE THE SMALL COMPACTNESS OF IT 
YEAH I LIKE IT I THINK IT'S NICE 
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK IT IS VIC FIFTIES 
ONE WAS GONNA SAY VICTORIAN THE OTHER WAS FIFTIES YEAH 
PRESUMING YOU MEANT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES 
NO NO NO 
IT WAS PROBABLY ME THAT WAS WAY OFF THE MARK IT'S VERY MUCH TWENTIETH CENTURY 
IT MIGHT BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN NINETEEN TEN AND NINETEEN THIRTY 
OH REALLY BUT I THINK IT'S A LOVELY THING I DO TOO LET'S TURN IT OVER AND HAVE A LOOK 
IT'S A BIT TATTY THERE BUT IT'S IF YOU WERE BORN IN NINETEEN TEN YOU'D BE ENTITLED TO HAVE A SAGGY BOTTOM 
IT'S VERY SOLID HOW MUCH IS IT 
IT'S FORTY FIVE AND WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GET IT FOR 
I THINK WE CAN GET IT FOR THIRTY FIVE 
SEE I THINK THAT IS NOT EXPENSIVE 
BUT THIS IS BARGAIN HUNT IS THIS GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT AT AUCTION 
I THINK IT COULD MAKE A FIVER WON'T IT 
EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T WANT IT FOR A CHILD 
YOU MAY WANT IT BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A REALLY NICE DOLL OR TEDDY BEAR THAT MIGHT BE REALLY OLD AS WELL 
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO SIT THEM ON IT 
HERE'S THE DEAL I THINK THE MINIMUM IT'S GONNA MAKE IS TWENTY TO THIRTY IT SHOULD DO THAT ALL DAY LONG 
AND IF YOU'RE ON A GOOD DAY YOU KNOW IT MIGHT JUST TOP FORTY 
GONNA BUY IT YES 
IT'S GONNA BE OUR LUCK ON THE DAY GO ON OFF YOU GO O. K. THEN 
I HOPE THEY DO WELL I REALLY HOPE THEY DO WELL 
JACKIE BOUGHT THE CHAIR FOR THIRTY FIVE NO SITTING DOWN ON THE JOB FOR THE BLUES 
NOW CAROL SONA HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE 
NO I HAVEN'T LIKE MY NANNY HOLMAN'S MANGLE IN THE KITCHEN ABSOLUTELY 
MY MOTHER HAD ONE AS WELL BUT THIS IS FOR A SPECIAL PURPOSE 
NOW JUST THINK IN TERMS OF COUNTRY HOUSES OR IMPORTANT TOWN HOUSES 
WHERE YOU HAD A LAUNDRESS TO SUPPLY LINEN FOR THE HOUSEHOLD 
YOU ALSO HAD SERVANTS THAT WOULD WEAR UNIFORMS 
OFTEN WITH APRONS AND CAPS THAT HAD A DESIGN WHICH WE CALL CRIMPING 
AND THIS MACHINE DID THE FRILLING ON THE LINEN 
NOW THE LINEN WAS VERY STARCHED SO WHEN IT WAS PASSED THROUGH HERE IT WOULD COME OUT ALL FANCY 
I WISH I HAD SOMETHING TO GO THROUGH HAVE YOU GOT ANY TISSUE PAPER ON YOU THERE YOU GO 
OH GOSH I'M NOT THEN ASK WHERE THAT CAME FROM 
RIGHT LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE IF I FEED IT THROUGH 
CAN YOU SEE IT COMING THROUGH 
OH LOOK THAT'S GREAT ISN'T IT 
SO YOU GET THE SORT OF CRIMPED DESIGN ALL THE WAY ALONG 
CAN YOU SEE THAT VERY GOOD 
SO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE EDGES OF APRONS HATS AND SUCHLIKE 
SO THIS IS WHAT THIS IS FOR NOW THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN FASHION 
PROBABLY ABOUT THIRTY FORTY YEARS AND THEN THEY WERE NO LONGER USED 
TO FIND ONE IN SUCH WONDERFUL CONDITION 
COMPLETE WITH THIS LITTLE RATCHET 
TO KEEP THE THING FIRM ON TOP OF THE TABLE IS SO RARE RIGHT 
THEY'RE ASKING NINETY FIVE NOW WHAT D'YOU THINK 
IS IT WORTH GOING FOR IF WE CAN GET THE PRICE DOWN 
I LIKE IT KITCHEN PARAPHERNALIA EXACTLY 
I THINK I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT IS A COLLECTIBLE AND I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS AND IT'S GOT THE CROWN 
IT'S GOT THE CROWN STAMP ON IT IT'S GOT ALL THE OTHER DETAILS WHICH YOU'D EXPECT 
OH LET ME JUST WET MY FINGER 
OH THAT'S GOOD 
IT'S GOT PATENTED JULY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE 
THAT IS GOOD ISN'T IT IT IS GOOD YES SHALL WE GO FOR IT 
LET'S GO FOR IT GO FOR IT 
THIS TIME BEAT DOWN THE PRICE 
WELL THIS TIME I'M GOING TO NEGOTIATE 
LOVELY O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
DAVID MANAGED TO CRIMP THE PRICE DOWN FROM NINETY FIVE TO SEVENTY FIVE 
BRAVO THAT MAN 
I THINK I'VE FOUND SOMETHING YOU HAVE INDEED HAVEN'T YOU 
A POST BOX A POST POX 
YEAH I'VE HAD TO CHECK WITH THE STALLHOLDER IT'S THIRTY FIVE 
BUT HE'LL LET ME HAVE IT FOR TWENTY FIVE 
AND I QUITE LIKED IT WHY 
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUN AND QUIRKY AND SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT 
AND I JUST QUITE LIKED IT 
HOW OLD D'YOU THINK IT IS HE SAID IT'S NINETEEN FIFTIES AND IT'S GOT EDWARD THE SEVENTH 
WELL THIS IS WHAT WE CALL OUT OF PERIOD 
IT'S SOMETHING WHEN WAS HE NINETEEN TWENTIES SOME TIME YEAH 
SO THE DEALER SAYS ITS NINETEEN FIFTIES 
I WONDER ACTUALLY WHETHER IT'S A GOOD BIT LATER THAN THAT 
I THINK IT COULD BE QUITE A BIT LATER THAN THAT 
YOU'D EXPECT IT TO BE MADE OUT OF PLASTIC BUT IT'S TIN ISN'T IT 
THE DEALER SAID THAT AS FAR AS HE WAS AWARE 
THEY DIDN'T MAKE PLASTIC UNTIL AFTER THE SIXTIES SO THAT'S WHY HE THOUGHT IT WAS FIFTIES 
SO WE'VE GOT A POST BOX THAT'S A MONEY BOX AND YOU PUT YOUR PENNIES IN THERE 
AND THEY COME HURTLING STRAIGHT OUT THE BOTTOM 
COS THERE'S NO BUNG IN IT LIKE MY MONEY DOES 
SO WHO IS GOING TO BUY THIS AT AN AUCTION SALE 
I THOUGHT SOMEBODY THAT COLLECTS MONEY BOXES OR SOMEBODY THAT USED TO WORK FOR ROYAL MAIL 
OR SOMEONE THAT COLLECTS POSTBOXES OR SOMEBODY LIKE LAURA SHE'S GOT THE ANSWERS HASN'T SHE 
ABSOLUTELY IF THIS IS GONNA MAKE YOU A PROFIT IT WILL GO TO SOMEONE 
WHO'S COLLECTING POST OFFICE STUFF RATHER THAN ANY OTHER AVENUE 
BUT WHAT YOU'RE NOW RELIANT UPON IS THAT THEY'VE GOT TO KNOW 
THAT IT'S IN THE AUCTION SALE AND THEN IT MIGHT MAKE THIRTY TO FIFTY 
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO WE'VE GOT TO HER GIVE HER HER HEAD YES 
SIMILAR COLOUR ISN'T IT LOOK 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT YEAH 
I LIKED IT IT'S THE BEST REASON FOR BUYING IT ISN'T IT 
IT WAS DIFFERENT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE 
YOU WANTED SOMETHING QUIRKY YEAH I LIKED IT SO 
HOW MUCH IS IT TWENTY FIVE YOU GO AND PAY THE MAN AGAIN 
SHE IS THE MONEY HOLDER SHE IS SHE'S GOT THE MONEY WE CAN'T ARGUE

IT'S WEARING HEAVY BUT I'LL TRY 
NEVER STOPPED YOU IN THE PAST HAS IT I'LL GIVE IT A GO GOOD LUCK PHIL 
ME I'M GOING TO HAVE A NOSE AROUND GOODWOOD HOUSE WHAT COULD BE NICER 
BUILT OF FLINT WITH COPPER CUPOLAS 
GOODWOOD IS AN IMPRESSIVE AND BEAUTIFUL HOUSE 
JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM THE FAIR NEAR CHICHESTER IN WEST SUSSEX 
THE ESTATE IS THE SEAT OF THE DUKES OF RICHMOND 
ONE OF THE FOUR SURVIVING DUCAL FAMILIES 
DIRECTLY DESCENDED FROM CHARLES THE SECOND'S ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN 
THE FIRST DUKE WAS THE SON OF LOUISE DE KEROUAILLE 
ONE OF THE KING'S MISTRESSES 
SHE WAS A CONVENT EDUCATED GIRL FROM A FRENCH ARISTOCRATIC AND RELIGIOUS FAMILY 
NOT SURPRISINGLY HER PARENTS DISAPPROVED OF 
HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KING BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS IMMORAL 
HOWEVER THE FAMILY WASN'T WEALTHY 
SHE HADN'T GOT MUCH OF A DOWRY 
AND THUS WASN'T BEING COURTED BY SUITABLE YOUNG MEN 
THAT WAS HOW SHE CAME TO BE A KEPT MISTRESS OF THE KING 
AND BOY WERE THEIR PERKS TO BEING THE KING'S BIT ON THE SIDE 
HE LAVISHED LOUISE WITH TITLES LANDS WONDERFUL SILVER AND JEWELLERY 
AND A PLETHORA OF PICTURES TAPESTRIES AND FURNITURE 
AND SOME OF LOUISE'S TREASURES HAVE ENDED UP HERE AT GOODWOOD 
INCLUDING THIS EXTRAORDINARY SUITE OF MARQUETRIED FURNITURE 
NOT ONLY HAVE WE GOT A CENTRE TABLE WE HAVE A CABINET AND A PAIR OF CANDLE STANDS 
THIS SUITE OF FURNITURE WAS PROBABLY MADE BY GERRIT JENSEN WHO WAS ONE OF 
THE CABINET MAKERS WORKING SPECIFICALLY FOR CHARLES THE SECOND 
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THESE SO CALLED MATCHING SUITES IS TO ABSOLUTELY SATISFY YOURSELF 
THAT THE ELEMENTS THAT GO TO MAKE THEM UP DO ACTUALLY MATCH 
IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU LOOK AT THE LEG STRUCTURES YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A NARROW TAP ERING COLUMNAR SECTION 
BOTH ON THE CENTRE TABLE LEGS AND ON THE SIDE CABINET 
AND ALSO THE ELEMENTS OF LEG ON THESE CANDLE STANDS 
CHECK OUT THE MARQUETRY ITSELF 
HERE WE'VE GOT A SPRAY OF FLOWERS AND A BIRD ON TOP OF A DARK GROUND 
ON THE CABINET A SIMILAR SPRAY OF FLOWERS AND A BIRD ON A DARK GROUND 
HERE WE'VE GOT STAINED GREEN IVORY ELEMENTS AND THE ODD WHITE FLOWER 
MATCHING STAINED GREEN IVORY HERE WITH SOME MORE OF THESE WHITE FLOWERS 
ALL THESE INLAID ELEMENTS ARE AGAIN REFLECTED IN THE CANDLE STANDS 
IT'S A GREAT THRILL TO FIND THE PAIR AS PART OF THIS SUITE ALL INTACT 
I PERSONALLY AM PERFECTLY HAPPY THAT ALL THREE PIECES STARTED LIFE TOGETHER 
WHAT IS ODD ABOUT THIS CABINET IS THE TREATMENT OF THIS TOP TIER 
IT DEPICTS A CONTINUOUS HUNTING SCENE 
HERE WE'VE GOT A HUNTSMAN WITH A LANCE 
CHASING AFTER HIS HOUNDS WHO IN TURN ARE CHASING A BOAR 
IT'S A BOAR HUNT 
AND A VERY ODD THING TO HAVE ABOVE A SERIES OF DRAWERS INLAID WITH BIRDS AND SPRAYS OF FLOWERS 
AND I RECKON THAT ONE OF THE DUKES OBSESSED BY HUNTING 
DECIDED TO CHANGE THE DECORATION ON THE TOP OF THIS CABINET 
SO THAT IT REFLECTED HIS INTEREST 
SO FROM THE TREASURES GIVEN BY A KING TO HIS LOVER 
I WONDER WHAT THE TREASURES UNEARTHED BY OUR TEAMS 
WILL REALISE TODAY OVER AT THE AUCTION 
IT IS A DELIGHT TO BE IN WEST SUSSEX AT BELLMANS' SALEROOM WITH JONATHAN PRATT 
GOOD MORNING TIMOTHY VERY NICE TO SEE YOU 
THE RED TEAM SONA AND CAROL HAVE GOT THIS CHAD VALLEY BOXED WIND UP GRAMOPHONE TOY 
IS THAT GOING TO DO ANY GOOD AT ALL CHAD VALLEY'S A GOOD NAME 
STILL GOING TODAY THERE'S A GREAT COLLECTORS' INTEREST IN THIS SORT OF THING 
THAT'S A RELIEF SADLY THOUGH IT DOESN'T HOLD A LOT OF VALUE 
WHEN WE LOOKED IT UP WE FOUND WHEN THE MODEL WAS MADE 
AND WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING YOU COULD KNOW ABOUT IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY TO THIRTY 
REALLY FORTY PAID SO THEY PAID PROBABLY A BIT TOO MUCH 
IT'S A NICE THING BUT POSSIBLY TOO MUCH MONEY POSSIBLY TOO MUCH MONEY 
NOW THE BILLIARDS ROOM SCORING DEVICE LOOKS TO ME TO BE A MIXTURE OF MATERIALS WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YOU'VE GOT THIS NICE ACANTHUS LEAF CARVED FRAME WHICH IS VICTORIAN BUT THE INSIDE IS ALL 
THE GUBBINS IN THERE ARE ALL TURNED AND HAVE A SORT OF CONTINENTAL FEEL 
OLIVE WOOD AND EBONY AND ODD VARIETIES OF WOOD 
IT SERVES A FUNCTION AND IT'S NOT A BAD EXAMPLE PEOPLE LIKE BILLIARDS 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S ON THE UP AND UP 
QUITE FUN HOW MUCH PROBABLY ABOUT FIFTY TO EIGHTY NINETY PAID 
THAT COULD BE A TAD TOO MUCH OH DEAR WE'RE NOT GETTING ON ALL THAT WELL 
WHAT ABOUT THE OBJECT THAT NO MODERN HOUSEHOLD CAN BE WITHOUT 
A CUFF AND COLLAR CRIMPER IN CAST IRON 
YOU'D NEED SOMETHING HARD WEARING TO CRIMP YOUR CUFFS AND COLLARS YEAH THAT'S A TOUGH HEAVYWEIGHT JOBBIE 
USELESS OR WHAT I THINK SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING 
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO COLLECTS STUFF CONNECTED TO THE LAUNDRY 
METALWARE LIKE THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SELL WHAT CAN I SAY 
THAT'S THE NICEST THING YOU'VE SAID SO FAR 
SERIOUSLY HOW MUCH WOULD IT MAKE FIVE NOTE MELTED DOWN 
WE SHOULD HAVE MARKETED IT AS A PASTA MACHINE OR SOMETHING 
YES THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA 
THIRTY TO FIFTY 
THEY PAID SEVENTY FIVE AND IN MY VIEW IT DOES NOT STAND A SNOWFLAKE'S CHANCE 
OF MAKING ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE AUCTION 
ANYWAY ON THAT BASIS THEY'LL DEFINITELY NEED A BONUS BUY SO LET'S GO AND LOOK AT IT 
NOW SONA CAROL YOU NAUGHTY GIRLS YOU SPENT TWO HUNDRED FIVE 
YOU GAVE DAVID BARBY NINETY OF LEFTOVER LOLLY WHAT DID HE SPEND IT ON 
LOOK AT THAT HUBBLE BUBBLE WHEN SHALL WE THREE MEET AGAIN 
WING OF BAT TELL US ABOUT IT 
THIS IS A FABULOUS PIECE OF COPPER WORK 
IT'S DOMESTIC COPPER WORK MADE BY A GENTLEMAN CALLED MR. HALL OF NORWICH 
ROUND ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
IT IS BEAUTIFULLY HAND MADE AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IF YOU LOOK DOWN THE SIDE THERE 
AND ALSO ON THE EXTERIOR HOW IT'S BEEN JOINED TOGETHER 
IT'S A SUPERB EXAMPLE OF DOMESTIC COPPERWARE 
SO THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COPPER TO PUT ON A HEARTH TO BOIL OF WATER FOR WASHING 
AND SOMEONE HAS ADAPTED IT AS A COAL BIN 
TO KEEP EVERYTHING TIDY THEY HAVE ADDED A LID WHICH WASN'T ORIGINAL 
IT'S STILL COPPER WITH A NICE WOOD HANDLE THERE 
HE DOES SHOOT A LINE 
SO GIRLS WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL IT GO FOR THE AUDIENCE TODAY AT THIS AUCTION 
THIS SALEROOM SELLS QUALITY SO I HOPE THERE WILL BE SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO SAYS WE WANT ONE OF THOSE 
WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT TO KNOW SONA 
CAN YOU GUARANTEE PROFIT ON THIS 
YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE A PROFIT ANYWHERE 
I PAID EIGHTY FIVE FOR THIS HOW MUCH 
EIGHTY FIVE IT SHOULD GO FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY

TELL US MORE YOU LIKE IT DON'T YOU JACKIE IT'S MADE IN ENGLAND 
IT'S A BIT OF DOULTON IT MUST BE TO DO WITH THE LOO THEN IT'S SALT GLAZE NOT NECESSARILY 
I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR I'D GUESS IT WAS MADE ROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TO NINETEEN TEN 
AS TAPS GO IT'S A BELTER I RECKON IT MIGHT MAKE TEN OR FIFTEEN PROFIT 
WHAT'S THIS F. B. IT'S A FINE BUY THAT STANDS FOR 
O. K. THEN LET'S PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
IT'S INTERESTING 
I HAVE TO SAY IT'S A BIT BOYS E. Y. A BIG TAP LIKE THAT 
NOT MANY CHICKS WOULD REALLY FIND IMMEDIATELY A GREAT EMPATHY WITH A PLUMBING DEVICE 
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE PUT THIS ANYWAY THERE WE GO 
IT'S DECORATIVE YOU'RE PREDICTING IF THE DOULTON BUYERS ARE HERE 
PERHAPS A PROFIT OF TEN OR TWENTY ABSOLUTELY 
YOU ONLY SPENT THIRTY ANYWAY YOU'VE GOT ALL THAT INFORMATION GIRLS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE NOW YOU CAN DECIDE LATER 
FOR THE VIEWERS LET'S SEE WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT THE BIT OF OLD PLUMBING 
WELL THIS IS A PRETTY WACKY ONE ISN'T IT YEAH 
A DOULTON LAMBETH STONEWARE TAP QUITE A NICE THING VERY DECORATIVE OBJECT 
OVERSIZE LIKE THIS HAS A NOVELTY ABOUT IT 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SUCH A BIG ONE BEFORE NOT RECENTLY 
IT'S ON THE BIG SIDE OF TAPS 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH IT THE INTERIORS MARKET WOULD PROBABLY LIKE THIS QUITE A LOT 
THE INTERIORS MARKET THE INTERIORS MARKET NOT THE EXTERIORS MARKET 
YOU HAVE THE DOULTON NAME THEY'RE SYNONYMOUS WITH WATER PIPES 
AND ALL SORTS AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SEWAGE PIPES 
YES THEN THEY WENT INTO MAKING DECORATIVE POTTERY STUDIO POTTERY 
HOW MUCH YOU THINK THIS IS WORTH I THINK PROBABLY TWENTY TO THIRTY 
TWENTY TO THIRTY YOU THINK YOU WILL TAP THE MARKET 
I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SIPHON SOME BIDDING 
GOOD PHILIP PAID THIRTY FOR IT AND HE HAS GOT HIGH HOPES EXCELLENT 
BUT THEN HE'S ALWAYS GOT HIGH HOPES 
TALKING ABOUT HIGH HOPES THE AUCTIONEERING BUSINESS YES 
YES I'LL BE UP THERE THIS MORNING HAMMERING IT OUT HAMMERING IT OUT THANK YOU 
EVEN WHILE THEY'RE TAKING THE SALE I'M OUT HERE HARD AT WORK 
TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING OF INTEREST TO TITILLATE YOU WITH 
NOW TELL ME HONESTLY 
ARE YOU TITILLATED BY THIS CHAP 
USUALLY THINGS IN BLACK CASES ARE NOT INCREDIBLY POPULAR 
BECAUSE THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH AND MOURNING IN SOME WAY 
BUT AT THE TIME THIS WAS MADE AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THE COUNTRY WAS IN THE GRIP OF A NEW FASHION 
CALLED THE AESTHETIC MOVEMENT 
A PERIOD IN ART HISTORY WHERE THIS COLOUR DARK BROWN AND BLACK WAS POPULAR 
ALL THINGS JAPANESE WITH CLEAN AND SIMPLE OUTLINES WERE POPULAR 
AND ALSO STYLISED FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE 
AND HERE WE HAVE GOT SOME STYLISED FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE IN THE SPANDLES AROUND THE CLOCK 
BUT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS THING IS THE USE OF THESE CERAMIC PLAQUES 
WE'VE GOT A CERAMIC PLAQUE HERE ON THE FRIEZE 
THE DIAL ITSELF IS MADE OF CERAMIC 
AND THE PLINTH PLATE IS ALSO CERAMIC 
AND THE PERSON WHO'S DESIGNED THIS HAS BEEN RATHER CLEVER 
THEY'VE HAD A FEW PUNS BECAUSE THE FRIEZE PLAQUE HAS BEEN ENAMELLED 
WITH SOME FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE THAT REPRESENT DEADLY NIGHTSHADE 
AND YET THEY'VE PUT TWO LITTLE INSCRIPTIONS ON IT THAT SAY NIGHT 
AND SHADE IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO TELL YOU THE TIME 
IN THE NIGHT WHEN IT'S SHADY THAT IS SOMEWHAT RELEVANT 
ON THE PLINTH PLAQUE IT SAYS DAY'S EYE 
WHICH IS FAIR ENOUGH AS AN INSCRIPTION 
BUT ACTUALLY THE FLOWERS ON IT ARE DAISIES 
AND IF YOU WERE A COCKNEY FELLOW YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THOSE DAISIES WERE ACTUALLY DAY'S EYES 
WHICH IS RATHER FUN THE DIAL ITSELF IS NICELY DESIGNED 
IT INCORPORATES ARABIC NUMERALS RATHER THAN ROMAN ONES 
EACH OF THE ARABIC NUMERALS HAS BEEN CAREFULLY DRAWN 
I LOVE THE THREES WITH THIS THIN LINE THAT BECOMES A THICK LINE 
REINFORCING THE ARTS AND CRAFTS CREDENTIALS OF THIS CLOCK 
I THINK IT'S A DELIGHT FOR PACKAGE 
THIS THING IS ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED IN THE AUCTION 
I DON'T THINK THAT IS INACCURATE AS AN ESTIMATE 
IN FACT IN TODAY'S MARKET IT MAY EVEN STRUGGLE TO MAKE THREE HUNDRED 
BUT AS A TIP AS SOMETHING TO PERHAPS GO AND INVEST SOME MONEY IN 
THIS IS AESTHETIC MOVEMENT STYLE OBJECT HAS TO BE INEXPENSIVE 
AND REALLY THE OBJECT TO BUY FOR THE FUTURE
