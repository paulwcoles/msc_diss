TURNING ON A TEN PENCE LABOUR M. P.'S 
WORRY WHAT SORT OF A GOVERNMENT 
DOES THEIR LEADER BELIEVE IN 
TONIGHT A GROWING BODY OF LABOUR 
M. P.'S SEE IT AS A TEST OF WHETHER 
GORDON BROWN CAN ANY LONGER BE SAID 
TO STAND FOR OLD LABOUR VALUES 
TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT 
ABOLISHING THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
HE BROUGHT IN WAS ABOUT IMPROVING 
THE LOT OF THE POOR BUT HOW CAN IT 
BE THE INQUEST JURY FINALLY 
DECIDES HOW DIANA DIED WILL 
MOHAMMED AL FAYED NOW STOP HIS 
CONSPIRACY THEORIES WE SPEAK TO 
HIS SPOKESWOMAN PROTESTS AGAINST 
THE BINGE OLYMPICS MOVED TO PARIS 
SO TO DO THE CHINESE MEN PROTECTING 
THE TORCH BUT WHO ARE THIS THEY 
AND WHAT POWERS DO THEY HAVE AS 
THE CLIMATE CHANGE SCARE SCIENCE'S 
EQUIVALENT OF THE D. A. VINCI NIGEL 
LAWSON SAYS SO BUT WHAT DOES HE 
KNOW I DID NO GOT INTO POLITICS TO 
MAKE SURE THAT POOR PEOPLE PAID 
MORE TAX WAS THE WAY THAT ONE 
LABOUR M. P. PUT IT THE REACTION TO 
THE DECISION TO ABOLISH THE TEN 
PENCE STARTING INCOME TAX HAS BEEN 
REACHED HARDLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY 
BUT THE QUESTION IT RAISES IS WHAT 
SORT OF GOVERNMENT POLITICS DOES 
GORDON BROWN BELIEVE IN THE 
CONSERVATIVE ARE CLAMBERING ON TO 
THE IRISH U. U. IF AND WHEN THEY 
REFORM A GOVERNMENT THEY WILL 
REVIVE IT 
THE LABOUR PARTY IS IN A SPIN AT 
THE MOMENT WHAT IS EXERCISING THE 
M. P.'S AND ACTIVISTS IS THE 
IMPLEMENTATION THIS WEEKEND THE 
MEASURES THAT GORDON BROWN 
ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR AS THE 
TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
THE LABOUR PARTY IF IT IS IN 
BUSINESS FOR ANYTHING IS TO 
PROTECT THE POOREST IN OUR 
COMMUNITY AS A RESULT OF 
SIMPLIFYING THE TAX SYSTEM WHICH 
I THINK MOST PEOPLE SUPPORT WE NOW 
FIND OURSELVES IN A POSITION OF 
MAKING THE LOWEST PAID THE WORSE 
OFF OFF GOOD EVENING GORDON 
I AM DELIGHTED TO BE DOING THIS 
DTSDZ 
TONIGHT THE PRIME MINISTER DTSDZ ANSWERED E. MAIL QUESTIONS IN A 
LABOUR PARTY WEB CHAT MANY WERE 
ABOUT THE TAX CHANGES 
TOM BRADLEY SAYS DO YOU THINK IT IS 
FAIR THAT OVER A MILLION OF THE 
LOWEST PAID IN SOCIETY HAVE THEIR 
STARTING TAX RATE DOUBLD THIS HAS 
CONFUSED ME 
THE REASON THIS IS A 
GOD CHANGE IS THAT MOST OF THE 
BENEFITS ARE GOING TO PEOPLE WHO 
ARE THE LOWEST INCOME PEOPLE IN OUR 
SOCIETY WHAT WE ARE DOING IS 
RAISING CHILD BENEFIT SO MILLIONS 
OF FAMILIES BENEFIT RAISING CHILD 
TAX CREDITS SO EVEN MORE GOES TO 
THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
LOW OR MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE IN OUR 
SOCIETY THEN WHAT WE ARE DOING IS 
CUTTING THE BASIC RATE OF TAX FROM 
TWENTY TWO PENCE TO TWENTY PENCE THAT IS THE 
FIRST TIME WE HAVE HAD THE LOWEST 
RATE OF TAX F. O. R. FIVE YEARS AND RAISING 
THE PENSIONERS' TAX ALLOWANCE SO 
MORE ARE TAKEN OUT OF TAX ALL 
TOGETHER TOGETHER GORDON BROWN'S TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BUDGET LEFT THE 
TOP RATE OF TAX UNCHANGED AT FORTY 
PENCE BUT HE TOOK THE TWENTY TWO PENCE 
BASIC RATE AND CUT IT TO TWENTY PENCE 
BUT TO PAY FOR IT HE TOOK THE TEN 
PENCE STARTING RATE OF TAX AND MADE 
IT DISAPPEAR ALL TOGETHER IN 
EFFECT THE LOWEST PAID START PAYING 
TAX AT TWENTY PENS IN THE POUND THE 
CONSERVATIVES ARE CALLING ON THE 
GOVERNMENT TO RETHINK THE POLICY 
I THINK THAT THE LAST THING WE 
SHOULD BE DOING AT A TIME WHEN 
EVERYONE IS SUFFERING AND GOING TO 
THE SHOPS AND FINDING THAT THE 
PRICES HAVE GONE UP FILLING UP AT 
THE PUMP S. THE PETROL PRICES GOING 
UP TO BE HITTING THE PEOPLE WHO 
CAN LEAST AFFORD TO IS WRONG IF 
ENOUGH LABOUR M. P.'S JOIN US WE MAY 
BE ABLE TO STOP THEM AND HELP 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO BE KICKED 
WHEN THEY ARE DOWN 
SO WHO IS LOSING OUT SINGLE ADULTS 
ON LESS THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR WITH IN 
CHILDREN NOT ON TAX CREDITS 
FAMILIES WITH TWO EARNERS WHO TAX 
CREDITS DO NOT RISE TO THE INCOME 
TAX LOSSES AND TAX PAYING WOMEN 
AGED SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR ON THE OTHER SIDE 
THE WIN REMEMBERS THE THOSE NON 
WORKING PARENTS AND THOSE EARNING 
BETWEEN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE THOUSAND AER 
THERE ARE CHANGES FROM THE LAST 
YEAR'S BUDGET THAT CAME IN THAT 
NEWS COMES FROM FOR THOSE ON THE 
BOTTOM HALF OF THE INCOME DWIX BUT 
THERE ARE AS TWICE AS MAIN R. MANY 
GAINERS AS LOSERS THE BOTTOM HALF 
GAIN THE MOST WERE THE REFORMS 
THAT IS BECAUSE WHAT IS GOING ON IS 
NOT JUST THE ABOL IGS OF THE 
STARTING RATE TO INCOME TAX BUT 
THE CHANGES OF TAX CREDITS AND 
PERSONAL ALLOWANCES TO PENSIONERS 
THAT MAKE A LOT OF LOWER INCOME 
PEOPLE BETTER OFF 
TO UNDERSTAND THE FEELS OF LABOUR 
NOW IT IS WORTH REMINDING 
OURSELVES HOW MUCH THEY CHEERED HOW 
MUCH WHEN GORDON BROWN INTRODUCED 
THE TEN PENCE RATE 
IT IS PRUDENT TO GET THE BENEFIT OF 
THE TEN PENCE STARTING RATE NOW 
EIGHT YEARS ON GORDON BROWN WAS 
FAR MORE LOW KEY WHEN ANNOUNCING 
THE TEN PENCE RATE ABOLITION SINCE 
THE BUDGET OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN MORE THAN SEVENTY 
M. P.'S HAVE SIGNED VARIOUS MOTIONS 
CALLING FOR SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENT 
RETHINK RETHINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE THE 
SMALL GROUPS WHICH ARE BEING 
PENALISED THAT NEED COMPENSATION 
I THINK THAT THE GENERAL THRUST OF 
THE P. L. P. WILL BE LOOKING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH WAYS OF 
IDENTIFYING THOSE LOSING OUT AND 
COMPENSATING THEM FOR THAT 
PARLIAMENT IS LARGELY DESERTED THIS 
WEEK BUT LAST WEEK OFF THE 
CORRIDOR IN ONE OF THE ROOMS 
GORDON BROWN FACED A MEET OF HIS 
BACK BENCHERS AT TIMES I AM TOLD 
THE MOOD WAS MUTINOUS AT ONE POINT 
THEY OPENLY HECKLED THE PRIME 
MINISTER WHEN HE SUGGESTED THAT NO 
ONE WOULD LOSE OUT AS RESULT OF 
THE TEN PENCE RATE THERE ARE 
CONCERNS IN THE LABOUR PARTY THAT 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS FAILED TO 
COMMUNICATE HIS VISION FOR THE 
COUNTRY EITHER TO THEM OR TOT 
COUNTRY AT LARGE 
SOME OF THE DISQUIET IS ABOUT THE 
ARRIVAL AT NUMBER TEN OF THIS MAN 
STEVEN CARTER A FORMER ADVERTISING 
EXECUTIVE APPOINTED AT GORDON 
BROWN'S PRINCIPLE 
ADVISOR AND CHIEF 
STRATEGIST SOME WORRY THAT HE IS 
TELLING THE PRIME MINISTER TO ADD 
SPEAK LIKE THIS 
THE MORE SUCCESSFUL CABLE COMES AND 
CABLE TELEPHONE PRODUCT THE MORE 
B. T. HAS TO MARKET ITS AS A BRAND 
WITH REAL PRODUCT OF DIFFERENCE 
GORDON BROWN WAS IN OXFORD MOST OF 
HIS M. P.'S DON'T WANT THEIR PARTY TO 
BECOME A DISTINCTIVE BRAND WITH A 
PRODUCT POINT OF DIFFERENCE THEY 
THINK IT SHOULD BE BUILT ON THE 
PARTY'S CORE VALUES SOME OFF THE 
RECORD THINK THAT GORDON BROWN HAS 
TO DO BETTER IN TRYING TO 
COMMUNICATE THE VALUES IN THAT 
CONTEXT THE TEN PENCE TAX ROW HAS 
BACK SHORT HAND FOR WIDER WORRIES 
IN MOMENT WE HEAR FROM THE 
TREASURY MINISTER JANE KENNEDY 
FIRST TO JOHN MCFALL IN GLASGOW 
WHY HAS IT TAKEN PEOPLE SO LONG TO 
WAKE UP TO THIS JOHN MCFALL I I DON'T KNOW THE TREASURY SELECT 
COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN TRIKE TRACKING 
THIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND INDEED IN OUR 
REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE MADE THE POINT 
THAT THERE WILL BE ABOUT FIVE THREE 
MILLION PEOPLE WHO WILL LOSE THAT 
WAS CONFIRMED BY THE DIRECTOR OF 
BUDGET WELFARE AND TAXATION WHEN HE 
CAME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IN THE 
BUDGET OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
TO BE SPECIFIC FIVE THREE MILLION PEOPLE 
WILL BE WORSE OFF AS A CONSEQUENCE 
OF THIS CHANGE 
YES THAT IS A BALL 
PARK FIGURE THAT WAS ADMITTED BY 
THE DIRECTOR WHEN HE CAME BEFORE 
THE COMMITTEE IT IS BECAUSE OF THE 
THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE TEN PENCE 
RATE AS YOU KNOW AND THE FACT THAT 
INCOME TAXS WERE REDUCED FROM TWENTY TWO 
PENCE TO TWENTY PENCE AS YOU HAVE SAID 
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE POOREST 
AREAS WILL GAIN SOME FOR EXAMPLE 
WOMEN AGED SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR EARLY RETIRIES 
MARRIED COUPLES WITHOUT CHILDREN I 
MADE A FEW CALCULATIONS A MARRIED 
COUPLE ON SEVENTEEN THOUSAND WITH NO CHILDREN 
COULD LOSE OVER THIRTEEN A WEEK 
HOW TROUBLED ARE YOU BY IT 
I AM 
CONCERNED ONE OF THE IRISH US THAT 
WE HIGHLIGHTED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WAS THAT THE 
WINNERS AND THE LOSERS FROM THE 
PERSONAL TAXATION CHANGES SHOULD 
READILY IDENTIFY WHAT THE SITUATION 
IS FOR THEM WE HAVE ASKED FOR THAT 
TO BE PUT IN THE BIG BUDGET BOOK 
THAT COMES OUT WHEN THE CHANCELLOR 
PRONOUNCES IN MANY WAYS WE SHOULD 
NOT BE SCRAPING IN THE UNDERGROWTH 
TO FIND OUT WHO IS WINNING AND 
LOSING LOSING JOHN MCFALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE ARE JOINED NOW BY JANE KENNEDY 
IN OUR LIVERPOOL STUDIO HOW DOES 
LABOUR PARTY GOVERNMENT DEBT TO THE 
POSITION WHERE IT DISADVANTAGES FIVE 
ZERO POINT THREE MILLION OF THE PEEREST POOREST 
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY 
BECAUSE TEN 
YEARS AGO WHEN ELECTED TO POWER WE 
INHERITED A SITUATION WHERE THE 
CHILD POVERTY AND LEVELS OF POVERTY 
WERE A SCANDAL WE MADE IT A 
PRIORITY TO ADDRESS THE REMAINING 
PROBLEM OF CHILD POVERTY WHICH WE 
SEE AS AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE IN 
ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE REFOCUSED 
THE RESOURCES FROM INCOME TAX THE 
OVERALL INCOME TAX CHANGES 
INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HAVE FREED ABOUT 
TWO BILLION OF EXTRA INCOME FOR 
FAMILIES IN THE U. K. AND WE HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO USE THAT TO HELP LIFT 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MORE CHILDREN ABOVE THE 
POVERTY LINE 
SO THIS WAS DELIBERATE DECISION 
NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU DID NOT 
ANTICIPATE WOULD HAPPEN YOU KNEW 
AS CONSEQUENCE OF MAKING THE 
CHANGES YOU WOULD MAKE ABOUT FIVE THREE 
MILLION PEOPLE WORSE OFF THE THE GROUPS WORSE OFF BREAK DOWN INTO 
LOTS OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THE 
TWO GROUPS THAT PAY 
WELL THEY 
HAVE POVERTY IN COMMON I SUPPOSE 
DON'T THEY 
THE TWO GROUPS MOST 
ADVERSELY AFFECTED ARE YOUNG SINGLE 
PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY FIVE AND OLDER WOMEN 
AGED BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY FIVE 
BUT YOU 
KNEW WHEN YOU MADE THE DECISION 
THEY WOULD BE DISADVANTAGED 
BECAUSE THE TAX CHANGES WERE 
STRUCTURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE 
LOOKED TO COMPENSATE EVERY GROUP 
THAT WE COULD WITHOUT THE PACKAGE 
CRUMBLING AND FALLING APART THE 
PACKAGE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE 
AND WAS A VERY NECESSARY REFORM TO 
MAKE MAKE BUT YOU KNEW THAT FIVE THREE MILLION 
PEOPLE WOULD BE MADE WORSE OFF AS A 
CONSEQUENCE OF THE CHANGES 
CORRECT 
IF I COULD SAY THAT THE CORRECT TWO GROUPS THAT I REGARDED I 
UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND I AM TRYING TO GET STRAIGHT 
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION 
I ACCEPT 
THE POINT YOU ARE MAKING WE DID 
KNOW THERE WOULD BE SOME LOSERS AS 
A RESULT OF THE PACKAGE THAT IS 
WHY THE PACKAGE WAS PUT TOGETHER IN 
SUCH A WAY THAT WE COMPENSATED 
THOSE GROUPS WHO NEEDED THE SUPPORT 
THE MOST 
THE TWO GROUPS THAT I REFERRED TO 
EARLIER THE YOUNG PEOPLE SINGLE 
PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE IT IS 
RECOGNISED THAT GROUP WILL SEE BY 
THEIR OWN EFFORTS THEIR OWN 
INCOMES INCREASE THE FASTEST OF ANY 
GROUP IN THE WORKING 
WHY IS IT 
SO MANY OF YOUR BACK BENCHERS 
FAILED TO UNDERSTAND 
THERE IS NO 
SUCH THING AS A POPULAR TAX NOBODY 
LIKES PAYING INCOME TAX WHEN YOU 
REMOVE SOMETHING LIKE THE TEN PENCE 
RATE OF INCOME TAX THAT HAS BEEN A 
GREAT HELP TO MANY MANY PEOPLE IT 
HAS ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO GO INTO 
WORK WE NOW HAVE A SYSTEM OF TAX 
CREDITS WHICH IS IN A MORE FOCUSED 
WAY BRINGING HELP AND ASSISTANCE TO 
THE LOWEST INCOME GROUPS 
ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH CHILDREN 
IS IT REALLY THE CASE THIS IS WAS 
STUNT SO THAT YOU COULD BRING OFF 
THE TWO PENCE CUT IN INCOME TAX 
THAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE SUCH A BROW 
BROW ABOUT AND THE CONSEQUENCE HAS 
BEEN WHAT IVAN LEWIS HAS SAID WHAT 
IT HAS BEEN THAT THIS GOVERNMENT 
IS LOSE BE TOUCH WITH WHAT FAIRNESS 
MEANS TO THE MAIN STREAM MAJORITY 
THAT WORK HARD KNOWING HOW 
WE 
THAT WORK HARD HAVE TO GO TO MEET THE TARGET OF 
HALVING CHILD POVERTY BY ONE THOUSAND TWENTY AND 
TWO THREE OH ONE OH AND REMOVING IT BY TWO THOUSAND TEN IS 
TO MAKE A GREAT EFFORT TO DO THAT 
WILL YOU REVERSE THIS 
I CAN'T SEE 
US REMOVAL REMOVING THE CHANGE 
IT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE 
CHANGES AS THE TAX MINISTER I AM 
THE LEAST POPULAR IN THE GOVERNMENT 
BUT WITH YOU WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE 
THAT PEOPLE ARE COMPENSATED AS A 
RESULT OF THE CHANGES THAT WE MAKE 
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE SEE A 
REAL BENEFIT FROM GOING FROM 
WELFARE BENEFIT INTO WORK AND THEN 
FROM IMPROVING THEIR OBSERVE 
POSITION WHEN IN WORK 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE THINK 
THE PRINCESS WAS KILLED IN A TRAGIC 
ACCIDENT THIRTY ONE PER CENT FOUND 
HER DEATH 
SUSPICIOUS BUT AN OVERWHELMING 
MAYORT OF PEOPLE MORE THAN THREE 
QUARTERS SAID THE INQUEST WAS A 
TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY 
WE FINALLY KNOW WHO WAS TO BLAME 
FOR PRINCESS DIANA'S DEATH IT 
WASN'T THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH AND 
IT WASN'T M. I SIX IT WAS THE DRUNKEN 
CHAUFFEUR AND THE PURSUING 
PHOTOGRAPHERS SAID THE JURY 
THOUGH IT TOOK THEM THREE AND A 
HALF DAYS AND IT WAS A MAJORITY 
VERDICT AT THAT THE FORMER 
METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER 
LORD STEVENS CLAIMED IT VINDKAITED 
HIS OWN INQUIRY WHICH HAD EARNED 
HIM VINDICATED HIS OWN INQUIRY 
WHICH HAD LED TO SLEDGING BY 
MOHAMED AL FAYED DID YOU 
CONTEMPLATE THE LEGAL ACTION NO NO IT WAS PART AND PARCEL OF THE JOB 
I 
WOULDN'T DO 
THAT AT 
THIS STAGE 
WHAT I WAS REALLY 
WORKED UP 
TO AN EXTENT WAS THE PEOPLE WHO 
WORKED FOR ME ACCUSED OF SIMILAR 
ACTION WHICH WAS UNFOUNDED AND 
WRONG WRONG THE JURY FOUND THE CONTRIBUTING 
FACTORS WAS THE SPEED AND DRIVING 
OF THE MERCEDES AND THE CARS OF 
THE PAPARAZZI THEY ALSO INCLUDED OF ALCOHOL HENRI PAUL 
HAD CONSUMED THAT NIGHT THE FACT 
THAT NEITHER DIANA OR DODI AL FAYED 
WAS WEARING A SEATBELT AND THEIR 
VEHICLE STRUCK PILLAR WITH A 
SMALL SURFACE AREA IN THE TUNNEL 
RATHER THAN WALL MOHAMED AL FAYED 
HAD TOLD THE 
BY 
THEIR 
VERDICT ON 
WHAT WAS AFTER ALL 
THE INQUEST 
INTO 
HIS SON'S 
TOO 
BUT HE 
SAID IT WAS 
A BLOW 
TO 
HIM AND TO MILLIONS OF OTHERS I'M I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO SAYS THEY 
WERE MURDERED DIANA 
PREDICTED SHE 
WOULD BE 
MURDERED AND 
HOW IT 
WOULD 
HAPPEN SO I AM DISAPPOINTED 
ALMOST FROM THE MOMENT OF THE FATAL 
IMPACT TWO PARALLEL BUT 
CONFLICTING NARRATIVES OF THE 
DEATHS AND WHAT SURROUNDED THEM 
BEGAN TO UNFOLD THE JURY HEARD 
BOTH ACCOUNTS MR. AL FAYED'S 
OUTLANDISH VERSION ECHOED BY 
PEOPLE ON HIS PAYROLL AND BY SOME 
MEDIA OUTLETS AND THE ALL TOGETHER 
MORE PROSAIC STORY OF TRAGIC 
ACCIDENT CLOUD ROULET WORKED FOR 
MR. AL FAYED AT THE RITZ IN PARIS 
HE WELCOMED DIANA AND DODI TO THE 
HOTEL 
MR. AL FAYED NOW IS NO MORE HOTEL ABLE TO SEE 
THE REAL 
TRUTH HE SEES 
ONLY THE TRUTH HE BUILT OR HIS 
STAFF BUILT AROUND THE CAR CRASH 
AFTER THE CRASH ROULET RUSHED TO 
THE ALMA TUNNEL WHERE DODI AL 
FAYED AND DIANA WERE DEAD OR DYING 
CHAUFFEURS FROM THE RITZ 
TOLD HIM 
THEY TRIED 
TO STOP HENRI PAUL FROM 
DRIVING THE COUPLE 
THEY BOTH CAME 
TO ME AND THEY SAID THEY SAW HENRI 
PAUL WAS NOT NORMAL AND TRIED TO 
NOT HAVE HIM DRIVE BUT BECAUSE 
HE'S PROTECTED BY MR. KLEIN THEY 
COULDN'T THEY HAD 
AN IDEA 
HE WAS 
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL MR. MR KLEIN WAS FRANZ KLEIN THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE RITZ REPORTS WERE 
THAT HE ORDERED A BARMAN TO SAY 
HENRI PAUL WAS DRINKING FRUIT JUICE 
WHEN HE HAD THE EQUIVALENT OF FOUR 
WHISKEYS THE 
FRENCH POLICE 
WERE IN 
NO 
DOUBT OF 
WHAT THEY 
FOUND IN 
ALMA TUNNEL IT WASN'T THE 
AFTERMATH OF 
AN ASSASSINATION 
IT 
AFTERMATH OF AN ASSASSINATION IT WAS A TRAFFIC 
ACCIDENT FULL 
STOP L. 
HAVE BEEN 
AT TRAFFIC 
ACCIDENTS LIKE 
YOU CAN HAVE IN FRANCE 
EVERY DAY 
YOU CAN HAVE IN FRANCE EVERY DAY THE CORONER 
REVIEW THE 
MEDICAL EVIDENCE ON 
REVIEW THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE ON HENRI 
FINDINGS WERE TO 
THE POINT AND UNAMBIGUOUS HENRI 
PAUL WAS 
NOT FIT 
TO DRIVE WHEN HE 
GOT 
INTO THAT 
CAR ON THE BASIS OF 
THE TOXICOLOGY 
IN THE HOURS BEFORE 
THE 
CRASH DODI 
AL 
FAYED HAD BEEN 
TO A 
JEWELLERS IN 
PARIS TO 
BUY 
RING HIS FATHER 
TOLD THE INQUEST 
IT WAS 
FOR HIS 
ENGAGMENT TO THE 
PRINCESS BUT 
CLAUDE ROULET 
WHO 
WENT WITH DODI TO THE STORE SAID 
HE NEVER 
MENTIONED 
AN ENGAGMENT 
NEVER HE WAS LOOKING FOR RING 
NOT FOR AN ENGAGMENT RING 
AN HOUR 
BEFORE HER DEATH THE PRINCESS TOLD 
MOHAMED 
AL FAYED 
ON THE 
PHONE THAT 
SHE WAS PREGNANT THAT'S WHAT HE 
TOLD THE JURY HE CLAIMED THE 
BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT LAUNCHED A 
PLOT TO HAVE DIANA AND DODI KILLED 
TO PREVENT A MUSLIM 
CHILD FROM 
BECOMING HALF 
BROTHER 
OR SISTER 
TO 
A FUTURE 
KING BUT THE JURY HEARD 
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF PREGNANCY 
I DIDN'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL 
THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT DIAGNOSIS OF 
PREGNANCY BY A PATHOLOGYIST IS AND 
I. N. THIS CASE CERTAINLY IS BY THE 
NAKED EYE LOOKING AT THE RELEVANT 
ORGANS 
I KNOW SHE'S NOT PREGNANT ORGANS THIS HAS 
BEEN PROVED 
ANY WAY 
WE 
WERE AWAY 
JUST TEN 
DAYS 
SHE 
DIED SHE 
HAD HER 
PERIOD 
WHEN WE 
WERE ON THE BOTH TOGETHER SHE WAS 
CERTAINLY NOT ENGAGED TO HIM OR 
EVEN CONSIDERING GETTING ENGAGED TO 
HIM HAD SHE HAD SOME CHANGE OF 
MIND A VERY SUDDEN CHANGE OF MIND 
IT 
WOULDN'T HAVE 
BEEN MR. 
AL FAYED 
WHO SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD FIRST 
BUT THE 
OF THE PARALLEL NARRATIVE OF EVENTS 
INSISTED 
UPON BY 
MR. AL 
FAYED AND 
GIVEN EXTENSIVE COVERAGE BY THE 
DAILY EXPRESS AMONGST OTHERS 
LAURIE MAYER BECAME DIRECTOR OF 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS TO THE HARRODS OWNER 
A YEAR AFTER THE TRAGEDY IN PARIS 
THE PEOPLE AROUND 
HIM FED 
WHAT 
MANY OF US VIEWED AS FANTASY AND 
I THINK THAT IS DEPLORABLE 
MOHAMMED WAS THE GREAT HONEYPOT 
AND SADLY THERE WERE LOT OF 
PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO DID 
ONLY WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR 
THE MOST LURID ALLEGATION WAS THE DUKE 
OF EDINBURGH 
RULING 
THE COUNTRY BEHIND THE SCENES 
WITH M. I SIX 
HAD ORDERED THE HIT IN THE PARIS 
TUNNEL HIS 
LETTERS TO 
DIANA WOULD 
PROVE 
HOW MUCH 
HE HAITED HER SAID 
MR. AL FAYED 
RELEASED EXTRACTS OF 
CORRESPONDENCE AND IT WAS RED IN 
FULL BY DIANA'S CLOSE FRIEND THEY THEY WERE WARM LETTERS THEY WERE 
COMPASSIONATE LETTERS ACTUALLY 
THEY WERE LETTERS THAT UNDERSTOOD 
THE SITUATION SHE WAS IN BUT 
SYMPATHISEED WITH IT THEY OFFERED 
ADVICE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH MR. SATISFIED SATISFIED HIMSELF TURNED 
IN AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE 
FROM THE WITNESS STAND MEMORABLY 
COMPARING 
CAMILLA DUCHESS OF 
CORNWALL 
TO A 
CROCODILE HE 
CORNWALL TO A CROCODILE HE ENJOYED FRANK EXCHANGE OF VIEWS 
WITH THE B. B. C.'S PETER HUNT 
WHAT EVIDENCE 
I AM 
NOT TALKING TO 
YOU ARE 
A BLOODY 
IDIOT PART OF THE 
ESTABLISHMENT YOU WORK FOR M. I SIX 
YOU IDIOT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO 
YOU IDIOT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE HER ABDUCTED BY ALIENS YOU 
WILL ALWAYS 
GET SOME FANTASISTS WHO 
WILL NEVER 
ACCEPT EVIDENCE THEY 
WILL REINTERPRET IT 
IN THE 
LIGHT 
THEIR CONSPIRACY THEORY 
FOR ANY 
RATIONAL 
PERSON TO 
HAVE HEARD 
THE 
THE MASTLY SUMMING UP 
FROM THE 
CORONER THAT BIT BY BIT 
DEMOLISHED THAT CONSPIRACY THEORY 
I DON'T THINK REASONABLE PEOPLE 
WILL GO ON FOR ONE MOMENT BELIEVING 
IT 
EVEN MR. AL FAYED'S LEGAL TEAM IT THREW IN THE TOWEL OVER SOME OF HIS 
MOST OUTRAGEOUS THEORIES AS SOME 
SAW WE HAVE TO PUT FORWARD 
CLIENT'S CASE BUT CAN 
ONLY DO 
ON THE BASIS OF 
EVIDENCE WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THIS CASE IDEAS 
THOUGHTS ABOUT 
HOW 
THESE TWO 
PEOPLE MET THEIR DEATH WAS PUT TO 
THE INQUIRY IT WAS EXAMINED BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY NO 
EVIDENCE THAT 
WOULD PERHAPS PERSUADE 
ANYONE 
WAS A 
POSSIBILITY HAS ACTUALLY 
COME OUT 
THE VERDICTS ARE FINALLY 
IN 
BUT IF 
THE NEWSNIGHT POLL 
IS 
IN BUT IF THE NEWSNIGHT POLL IS ANYTHING TO 
GO BY IN 
CORNERS 
THE BAR 
OF PUBLIC 
OPINION THEY ARE 
ALREADY BEING APPEALED MOHAMED AL 
FAYED'S SPOKESMAN KATHERINE WITTY 
IS HERE WITH ME DOES MR. ACCEPT 
THIS VERDICT WELL IT'S BEEN 
SIX HOURS 
SINCE 
THE VERDICTS 
AFTER 
SIX HOURS SINCE THE VERDICTS AFTER TEN YEARS 
OF FIGHTING 
HE IS 
TALKING IT THROUGH WITH HIS 
TO SEE 
IF THERE IS 
ANY OTHER 
LEGAL REDRESS HE SAID 
ON OATH HE WOULD REDRESS ACCEPT THE VERDICTS 
HE SAID THAT 
BEFORE THE TRIAL AND BEFORE PRINCE 
PHILIP AND THE QUEEN WERE RULED OUT 
AND THAT THE FRENCH PATHOLOGYIST 
WOULD NOT SO THE OATH 
WASN'T TAKEN AT 
VALUE 
IT WAS 
TAKEN AT 
THAT TIME VALUE BUT THINGS HAVE HAPPENED HE 
IS CONSIDERING 
HIS POSITION 
HAVE TO REMEMBER IT 
IS NOT 
JUST 
MOHAMMED 
TO CONSIDER 
THE VERDICTS 
AND ACCEPT 
THEM IT 
IS ALSO 
ON ALL 
THOSE PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE 
MANY 
YEARS IT 
IS AN 
ACCIDENT AND 
IT IS NOT 
YOU ARE 
THE SPOKESMAN FOR 
AL FAYED 
YOU CAN 
ONLY ANSWER 
FOR 
HIM SO 
LET ME 
ASK 
YOU DOES HE 
OF 
EDINBURGH ORDERED 
AN ASSASSINATION 
HE STILL BELIEVES 
THAT THE 
DUKE OF 
EDINBURGH WAS 
INVOLVED 
YES AND 
HE 
WILL ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT WHAT 
THESE INQUESTS SHOW IS THAT THERE 
ARE 
SOME EVIDENCE 
TO 
SUGGEST THAT 
THERE WAS 
A STAGED 
ACCIDENT 
THAT WAS 
PRESENTED TO 
THE JURY L. 
THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT MOM HAMED BELIEVES 
WAS NOT 
TRIAL 
HERE D. MOHAMMED 
BELIEVES IS 
NOT ON TRIAL 
HERE IT 
WAS 
ALLEGATIONS MADE 
BY OTHER 
AND 
DIANA HERSELF 
WAS LOOKED AT 
AND IT WAS 
RIGHT THAT 
IT WAS LOOKED 
AT 
HE STILL BELIEVES THAT M. I SIX AT ILLEGALLY EMBALMED THE BODY 
IT WAS 
EXTRAORDINARY THAT DIANA WAS 
EMBALMED AND 
DODI WASN'T 
HE MERELY 
ASKED THE 
QUESTION HE 
WANTED THE 
TRUTH 
HAVE BEEN ABOUT EXAMINING EVIDENCE EXACTLY 
AND THE 
PURPOSE 
OF AN 
INQUEST 
IS TO DETERMINE HOW 
SOMEBODY 
DIED THE CORONER HAVING 
LISTENED TO ALL THE EVIDENCE 
THERE WASN'T A SHRED OF EVIDENCE TO 
SUPPORT MOHAMED AL 
CONSPIRACY THEORY YOU 
KNOW THAT 
HE KNOWS 
THAT HE 
SWORE HE 
WOULD 
ACCEPT 
THE VERDICT OF 
THE 
AND 
NOW YOU SAY 
HE CAN'T 
WE HAVE 
WE HAVE HAD SIX MONTHS OF EVIDENCE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
WITNESSES NO ONE 
CAN CLAIM 
WITNESSES NO ONE CAN CLAIM NOT MEAN MOHAMED 
AL FAYED 
THAT IT 
MEAN MOHAMED AL FAYED THAT IT HASN'T WIDE RANGING AND RIGHTLY SO 
WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM ALL THE 
WITNESSES FROM THE PAPARAZZI 
ABSENT NOTICABLY OR THE 
PATHOLOGYIST WHO EXAMINED HENRI 
PAUL WHO REFUSED TO COME AND 
SENIOR 
FRENCH POLICE 
OFFICERS HE'S 
ENTITLED 
TO SAY 
IT HAS ANSWERED 
ENTITLED TO SAY IT HAS ANSWERED SOME QUESTIONS BUT NOT ALL 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS FIGURES RANGING 
FROM 
THREE MILLION 
TO EIGHT MILLION SPENT 
ON 
THIS THING 
SIX MONTHS OF 
EVIDENCE TAKING YEARS AND YEARS OF 
INQUIRY SEPARATE 
INDEPENDENT 
INQUIRY SEPARATE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS AND HE'S 
STILL NOT 
SATISFIED 
AND EIGHTY THREE 
BOOKS WRITTEN 
SATISFIED AND EIGHTY THREE BOOKS WRITTEN AND EACH CLAIMING TO KNOW THE TRUTH 
LET'S NOT BE CONCERNED WITH CRACKPOT BOOKS OF ONE KIND OR 
ANOTHER NOT 
MOHAMMED IS ANOTHER NOT ONLY MOHAMMED IS MAKING THESE ALLEGATIONS 
UNDERSTANDS OF COURSE 
HE'S UPSET 
HE LOST 
HIS SON 
BUT THERE 
POINT WHERE HE 
HAS TO 
HAVE SOME 
GRIP ON REALITY I'M TRYING 
GRIP ON REALITY I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT MOHAMMED 
TONIGHT IS 
JUST CONSIDERING 
TONIGHT IS JUST CONSIDERING THE FULL 
IMPACT OF 
THE VERDICTS THERE 
ARE 
STILL QUESTIONS REMAINING 
UNANSWERED PERHAPS THEY 
UNANSWERED PERHAPS THEY ALWAYS WILL 
BE PERHAPS 
THERE IS NO 
FURTHER TO 
TAKE IT 
WOULDN'T 
FURTHER TO TAKE IT WOULDN'T THE GRACIOUS 
THING TO DO 
BE 
TO ACCEPT 
GRACIOUS THING TO DO BE TO ACCEPT THE 
VERDICT OF 
THE JURY HE 
HE HAS SAID 
ON OATH HE 
WILL ACCEPT 
VERDICT 
OF THE 
JURY 
YOU HAVE 
HE DIDN'T 
BELIEVE IT 
THERE HAVE 
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT THERE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THEN HE IS 
ENTITLED SIX HOURS LATER TO BE 
STILL CONSIDERING HIS 
OPTIONS IT 
MAY BE THERE 
IS 
NOTHING MORE 
HE CAN 
DO THAT 
IS ALL 
YOU AND 
THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC CAN BE 
CONCERNED WITH 
HOW 
HE 
DEALS PRIVATELY IS 
HIS OWN 
BUSINESS IT IS 
WHETHER OR 
NOT ANY 
MORE CAN BE 
DONE PUBLICLY THAT IS 
WHAT HE'S LOOKING AT 
THE PUBLIC IS 
ENTITLED TO EXPRESS A WHETHER 
OR NOT 
TO SPEND THE TAXES 
ON WHAT 
AT TIMES WAS A PANTOMIME OF 
INQUESTS 
WHAT HAS BEEN PANTOMIME INQUESTS IS THE TWO 
POLICE INVESTIGATIONS 
AT 
GREAT PUBLIC 
EXPENSE AND 
STEVENS HAS TO GO 
HOME KNOWING THAT 
HIS REPORT COSTING THREE POINT SIX MILLION 
IS WRONG ISN'T 
IT THAT MOHAMED 
DIFFICULT 
POSITION THERE 
IS ONLY 
ONE PERSON 
NAMED 
IN THESE 
VERDICTS 
THAT IS 
HENRI PAUL WHO IS AN EMPLOYEE OF 
MR. AL 
FAYED 
MOHAMMED HAS 
MR. AL FAYED MOHAMMED HAS LIVED FOR TEN 
YEARS WITH 
EVERYONE ACCUSING 
HIM OF 
COVERING 
UP AN ACCIDENT 
EVERYONE 
SAYING TO 
HIM HE 
WAS THE 
ONE WHO OKED 
THIS PLAN TO 
LEAVE BY 
THE REAR OF THE RITZ AND TREVOR 
REES JONES AND OTHERS 
HAVE MADE 
MONEY 
OUT OF 
SAYING THAT BUT HE 
CAN SAY THAT 
HE HAS AN 
UNLAWFUL 
VERDICT 
APPARENTLY HE 
MAY NOT 
VERDICT APPARENTLY HE MAY NOT ACCEPT THAT HE MAY 
WELL 
ACCEPT IT 
I CAN'T TELL YOU 
THAT HE'S 
ENTITLED TO 
THINK ABOUT 
IT 
WITH THE INQUEST OVER 
IS HE 
GOING TO 
APOLOGISE FOR 
CALLING 
OF 
CORNWALL A 
CROCODILE HE WILL 
OF CORNWALL A CROCODILE HE WILL CONSIDER WHAT HE DOES ABOUT THAT 
OR CALLING THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH NAZI WILL HE 
APOLOGISE OR 
SPOKESMAN IT 
IS NOT UP 
TO YOU TO 
SAY IF 
HE 
SHOULD APOLOGISE HE 
CONSIDER IT 
HE HAS TO 
THINK 
CONSIDER IT HE HAS TO THINK ABOUT IT 
OF COURSE 
HE DOES 
IT 
IS SIX 
IT HOURS 
SINCE THE 
VERDICT A 
HOURS SINCE THE VERDICT A VERY EMOTIONAL 
TIME FOR 
HIM HE 
HAS HAD 
TEN YEARS 
OF FIGHTING HE IS 
RESPONSIBLE 
FOR A 
JURY AT THIS 
INQUEST 
THERE WAS ONE 
POINT WHEN 
IT WAS 
GOING TO 
CLOSED DOORS AND PERHAPS 
A JURY 
OF 
MEMBERS OF 
THE ROYAL 
HOUSE HOLE 
THIS WAS 
SERIOUSLY BEING 
EVEN IN 
TWO THOUSAND SIX HE 
WAS 
THE ONE 
WHO 
FOUGHT 
FOR A JURY 
NO ONE NOW 
RIGHTLY 
SAY THAT 
WAS THE WRONG 
TO LOOK 
AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT 
MATTER MATTER THERE'S COACH DRIVER CAN 
BOTH HE HAD 
THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH 
IN THE BACK OF THE BUS AFTER 
YESTERDAY'S PROTESTS IN LONDON THE 
FRENCH 
POLICE TOOK 
THINGS 
THEIR OWN 
HANDS 
SNUFFED OUT 
THE 
THEIR OWN HANDS SNUFFED OUT THE TORCH 
EVERY 
TIME THEY SAW PROTESTORS 
THE TORCH HAS THE 
CHINESE WHO 
ARE THEY 
POWERS 
DO THEY HAVE 
AND WHY ARE 
THEY INVOLVED AT 
WHEN PROTESTORS 
THREATENED TO 
WHEN PROTESTORS THREATENED TO DISRUPT THE OLYMPIC PLANE FLAME 
EVERYONE 
EXPECTED THE 
BOYS IN BLEW 
EVERYONE EXPECTED THE BOYS IN BLEW TO PROTECT IT NOT THESE BOYS 
BLUE THE 
FLAME COMES 
DEDICATED 
CHINESE MINDERS 
NOBODY 
DEDICATED CHINESE MINDERS NOBODY SEEMS 
TO KNOW 
WHO 
THEY ARE THIS 
IS 
THE 
MOMENT WHEN A DEMONSTRATOR 
ATTEMPTS TO 
TAKE THE 
FLAME FROM T. V. 
PRESENTER KONNIE HUQ 
HERE 
IS THE SAME 
INCIDENT AS SHOWN 
ON YOUTUBE 
THIS CHINESE 
ON YOUTUBE THIS CHINESE GUARD APPEARS TO GRAB 
THE PROTESTOR 
AROUND THE NECK AND 
THEN 
AROUND THE NECK AND THEN A POLICEMAN GRABS HIM 
AROUND THE 
NECK 
FINALLY THE MET 
TAKE OVER 
FINALLY THE MET TAKE OVER THE GRAPPLING AND 
THE CHINESE 
GUARDS GO 
BACK TO 
GUARDING EVEN 
THEN WHEN 
BACK TO GUARDING EVEN THEN WHEN THIS POLICEMAN CALLS FOR DEAL 
WITH ANOTHER 
PROTESTOR IT'S 
DEAL WITH ANOTHER PROTESTOR IT'S THE 
CHINESE GUARDS 
WHO RESPOND I 
DID THINK 
THEY SEEMED TO BE ORDERERING ABOUT 
THE POLICE AND THE OLYMPIC 
OFFICIALS EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE 
DOING WHAT THEY SAID L. CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE SO 
INTIMIDATING I FELT THE SAME WAY 
THEY WERE BARKING ORDERS LIKE RUN 
THEY PUSHED MY ARM UP LIKE YOU 
KNOW CARRY IT AT THAT HEIGHT YOU 
KNOW SLOW DOWN STOP THEY'RE 
QUITE FULL ON 
ALL THIS PROMPTS THE 
QUESTION WHO ARE THE MEN IN BLUE 
THE PROTESTERS SAY THEY'RE CHINESE 
SECRET POLICE THEY DID LOOK QUITE 
HANDY AND COMPOSED DURING THE 
TROUBLE WHAT POWERS DO THEY HAVE 
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE TOLD US 
THEY HAD NO EXECUTIVE POWER WHILE 
IN LONDON THOSE CLOSE TO THE 
ACTION TELL A DIFFERENT STORY 
VETERAN HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGNER 
PETER TATCHELL HAD THE CHANCE TO 
OBSERVE THE POLICING OF THE PROTEST 
CLOSE UP 
IT APPEARED THOSE MEN IN 
BLUE WHOEVER THEY WERE THEY 
LOOKED LIKE MILITARY MEN OR PERHAPS 
RIOT POLICE OR SECRET SERVICE 
AGENTS THEY SEEMED TO BE CALLING 
THE SHOTS AT CERTAIN POINTS THEY 
SEEMED TO BE IN SOME CASES 
DIRECTING THE POLICE WHAT TO DO AND 
TAKING AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ATTACKING 
PEOPLE WHO CAME NEAR THE TORCH THE THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAD NOTHING TO SAY 
ABOUT WHETHER THEY WERE SECURITY 
AGENTS BUT TO THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME 
MINISTER FLANKING GORDON BROWN 
TONIGHT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE 
WHICH HE'S LONG AGO CONSIDERED AS AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID IN 
AUSTRALIA SOME WEEKS AGO WE WILL 
NOT BE HAVING CHINESE SECURITY 
FORCES OR THE CHINESE SECURITY 
SERVICE PROZ VIEDING SECURITY FOR 
THE TORCH WHEN IT'S IN AUSTRALIA 
WE WILL BE PROVIDING THAT SECURITY 
WHAT OLYMPIC OFFICIALS THE CHINESE 
BRING IS A MATTER TO THEM ON THE 
SECURITY FRONT WE'LL BE PROVIDING 
THE SECURITY 
IN PARIS TODAY THE 
MEN IN BLUE ADDED SUN GLASSS TO 
THEIR UNIFORMS THE FLAME WAS PUT 
OUT THREE TIMES AS PROTESTERS 
CLASHED ALONG THE ROUTE IN SAN 
FRANCISCO WHERE THE FLAME ARRIVES 
ON WEDNESDAY THE PROTEST HAS 
ALREADY BEGUN WESTERN DIPLOMATS 
KNOW THAT PROTESTS ABOUT TIBET ARE 
JUST AS LIKELY TO HARDEN BEIJING'S 
STANCE AS TO CHANGE IT AS OF 
YESTERDAY OLYMPIC DIPLOMACY IS 
COMING FROM THE STREETS NOT 
MINISTERRIES AND THERE'S ONE 
PARTICULAR SET OF STREETS WHERE IT 
COULD STILL ALL UNRAVEL CHINA 
INTENDS TO TAKE THE FLAME THROUGH 
LHASA THE TIBETAN CAPITAL THERE 
THE MEN IN BLUE WILL MEET THE MEN 
IN ORANGE IT PROBABLY WON'T GET 
ONTO YOUTUBE 
WE ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE I. O. C. THE 
OLYMPICS MINISTER AND THE CHINESE 
EMBASSY ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE 
SECURITY GUARDS THEY ALL DECLINED 
TO BE INTERVIEWED 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME HAS 
CLIMATE CHANGE BEEN EXAGGERATED 
THE FORMER CHANCELLOR NIGEL LAWSON 
THINKS SO BEFORE THAT A ROUND UP 
OF TODAY'S NEWS OUR MAIN STORY 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS DEFENDED ITS 
DECISION TO ABOLISH THE LOWEST 
INCOME TAX BAND OF TEN P. IN THE POUND 
A COMMITTEE OF M. P.'S HAS CRITICISED 
THE CHANGE ANNOUNCED IN THE BUCT 
LAST YEAR SAYING IT WOULD PENALISE 
PEOPLE IN LOW PAID JOBS THE 
TREASURY MINISTER JANE KENNEDY SAID 
THE GOVERNMENT WON'T REVERSE THE 
TAX CHANGE 
I CAN'T SEE US 
REVERSING THIS CHANGE AT ALL IT'S 
AN IMPORTANT PACKAGE AND IT'S A 
VERY IMPORTANT INTEGRAL PART OF 
TAX CHANGES WE KEEP ALL TAXES 
UNDER REVIEW AS THE TAX MINISTER 
I'M THE LEAST POPULAR MINISTER IN 
THE GOVERNMENT L. CAN ASSURE YOU WE 
WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT 
PEOPLE ARE COMPENSATED AS A RESULT 
OF THE CHANGES WE MAKE 
POLICE IN 
WEST YORKSHIRE ARE CONTINUING TO 
QUESTION THE MOTHER OF SHANNON 
MATTHEWS THE NINE YEAR OLD GIRL 
WHO WENT MISSING EARLIER THIS YEAR 
KAREN MATTHEWS WAS ARRESTED LAST 
NIGHT ON SUSPICION OF PERVERTING 
THE COURSE OF JUSTICE SHANNON'S 
STEPFATHER CRAIG MEEHAN HAS BEEN 
CHARGED WITH POSSESSING CHILD 
PORNOGRAPHY HIS UNCLE MICHAEL 
DONOVAN IS CHARGED WITH KIDNAPPING 
AS PICTURES WERE RELEASED ON 
ZIMBABWEAN TELEVISION TODAY SHOWING 
THE TAKEOVER OF WHITE OWNED FARMS 
BY SO CALLED WAR VETERANS A HIGH 
COURT JUDGE HAS RULED THAT AN 
OPPOSITION PETITION CAN BE HEARD 
TOMORROW MORNING THE M. D. C. IS 
DEMANDING THE RELEASE OF THE 
ELECTION RESULTS ALSO TODAY 
ZIMBABWEAN POLICE ARRESTED SEVEN 
ELECTORAL REGISTRARS DUE 
IT WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE HEDGEHOG 
WAS DEAD OR ALIVE AT THE TIME OF 
THE ALLEGED ATTACK THE MAXIMUM 
PENALTY FOR WHICH IS FIVE YEARS IN 
PRISON 
PRISON AND THE MARKETS 
THE DANGER FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IS 
FAR MORE SERIOUS THAN PREVIOUSLY 
THOUGHT CLAIMS THE TOP SPECIALIST 
AT NASA IT CAN'T BE CONTAINED BY 
THE MEANS CURRENTLY PLANNED THE 
WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION SAYS IT'S 
BEGIN TO AFFECT PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND 
MILLION COS FACE HUNGER DISEASE 
AND POVERTY AS IT WORSENS THOSE 
ARE THE LATEST WARNINGS 
ALTERNTIVELY YOU MAY IF YOU 
READLET THOUGHTS OF THE FORMER 
CHANCELLOR NIGEL LAWSON DECIDE 
THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS LIKE THE D. A. 
VINCI CODE A GRAIN OF TRUTH AND A 
MOUNTAIN OF NONSENSE NATIONABLE 
MADNESS IN HIS WORDS 
NIGEL LAWSON'S CLIMATE CHANGE 
SCEPTICISM ISN'T AS PROFOUND AS 
SOME HE APPEARS TO CONCEDE THREE 
KEY FUND AMOUNTALS C. O. TWO CAUSES 
GLOBAL WARMING MAN MADE C. O. TWO IS 
RISING AND GLOBAL WARMING HAS BEEN 
OCCURRING BUT THAT'S AS FAR AS HE 
GOS IN PROVIDING SUCCOUR TO THOSE 
HE CALLS ALARMIST HE SAYS MAN MADE 
C. O. TWO ISN'T NECESSARILY THE MAIN 
CAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING IN 
EVIDENCE HE POINTS TOWARDS 
CONTRADICTORY DATA CHIEF AMONG 
WHICH PERHAPS IS THAT IN THE LAST 
TWO THOUSAND YEARS THE CLOIMATE HAS 
FLUCTUATED ALMOST AS MUCH AS THIS 
IN PRE INDUSTRIAL TIMES FURTHER HE 
REMINDS US THAT WHILST C. O. TWO LEVELS 
ARE CURRENTLY STILL RISING IN THE 
LAST FEW YEARS THE VARIATIONS IN 
GLOBAL AIR TEMPERATURE HAVE LEVELED 
OFF LAWSON RESERVES PARTICULAR 
VENOM FOR SIR NICOLAS STERN'S 
REVIEW OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS 
CONSEQUENCES HE COMPARES IT TO THE 
DODGY DOSSIER THAT LED US INTO THE 
IRAQ WAR HE ACCUSES IT OF 
SUPERFISHALITY SCAREMONGERING 
CALLS IT DEFICIENT ABSURD AND 
UNCONVINCING THE SOLUTION ISN'T TO 
SEEK TO CUT CARBON EMISSIONS AN 
IMPOSSIBLE GOAL BECAUSE THE 
ECONOMIC COST OF IMPLEMENTING IT 
WOULD BE LIKELY TO FAR EXCEED THE 
BENEFITS AFTER ALL DOING NOTHING 
IS BETTER THAN DOING SOMETHING 
STUPID HE WOULD PREFER TO SEEK 
TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH WITH 
CARBON CUTTING ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES 
LIKE NUCLEAR POWER AND BLASTING 
AEROSOLS INTO THE STRAT SPHERE TO 
IMPEDE THE SUN'S RAYS CRUCIALLY WE 
MUST DO WHATEVER IS REQUIRED TO 
ADAPT TO A WARMER PLANET IN OTHER 
WORDS JUST AS PEOPLE IN GREENLAND 
OR BANGLADESH CAN ADAPT TO LOCAL 
TEMPERATURES SO MUST THE REST OF 
US DO THE SAME LORD LAWSON IS HERE 
AS IS PROFESS SOR MICHAEL RATNER 
DIRECTOR OF THE SCIENCE MEW O. ZEEM 
MUSEUM WHEN YOU WERE CHANCELLOR 
OF THE EXCHEQUER IF MICHAEL FISH 
HAD WALKED INTO THE TREASURY AND 
SAID YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD THE 
PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING 
REQUIREMENTS I SUGGEST YOU'D HAVE 
TOLD HIM WHERE TO GO 
THIS IS NOT 
PURELY A SCIENTIFIC QUESTION THE 
ECONOMICS OF THIS ARE JUST AS MUCH 
OF IMPORTANCE AS THE SCIENCE L. 
HAVE TRIED TO LEARN A BIT ABOUT THE 
SCIENCE BUT I DON'T PUT FORWARD MY 
OWN SCIENTIFIC VIEWS WHAT I DO IS 
MAKE A POINT OUT HOW UNCERTAIN THE 
SCIENCE IS AND IT IS STRIKING 
THERE HAS BEEN NO WARMING SO FAR 
THIS CENTURY WHAT I REALLY DO IS 
DO PROPER ECONOMIC ANALYSIS YOU'VE YOU'VE READ THIS BOOK IS THE SCIENCE 
ACCURATE IN IT 
NO WE'RE TOLD THAT 
THE SCIENCE SAY RATIONAL OBJECTIVE 
ASSESSMENT BUT I'M AFRAID THAT'S 
NOT WHAT WE'REED OFFERED IT'S A 
CHERRY PICKED ACCOUNT OF SOME OF 
THE MORE ROSY PARTS OF THE OF 
PICTURE IF WE TAKE THE ISSUE WITH 
THE POLAR REGIONS WHICH ARE RESPOND 
TO A WARMING WORLD WE'RE TOLD FOR 
EXAMPLE THAT IN GREENLAND NO 
MELTING IS TAKING PLACE BUT WE 
HAVE MASSES OF DATA FROM SATELLITES 
AIRCRAFT AND ON THE SURFACE THAT 
SHOW THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL DISCHARGE 
OF ICE INTO THE OCEAN BUT THAT'S 
IT'S ACCELERATING 
IT'S WRONG YES YES IT'S WRONG 
EVERYTHING I HAVE 
WRITTEN THERE IS SOURCED AND 
REFERENCED AND YOU WILL SEE PAGES 
AND PAGES OF SOURCES AND REFERENCES 
AT THE BACK STKPWHRIN DEED THERE 
ARE EVERYTHING THAT IS THERE IS 
CORRECT 
ISN'T THE FORMER DIRECTOR CORRECT OF THE BRITISH AN ARCTIC SURVEY 
LIKELY IT TO KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING 
ABOUT 
THE ARCTIC ICE HAS BEEN ABOUT INCREASING CONSIDERABLY OVER THE 
PAST FEW MONTHS THAT IS WELL KNOWN 
IS THAT TRUE 
IF YOU SAY THAT THE 
SEA ICE IS FREEZING IT'S WINTER 
NO MORE THAN BEFORE ANY HOW THE 
POINT IS NOT SO MUCH THIS 
NO NO 
THERE'S A RANGE OF VIEWS ON THE SCIENCE T. H. SHOWS HOW UNCERTAIN IT 
IS CHRIS RAPLEY IS AT THE SCHEME 
END HE MAY BE RIGHT BUT THERE ARE 
DISTINGUISHED SCIENTISTS WHO TAKE A 
DIFFERENT VIEW 
THERE'S ONE VERY 
INTEREST POINT THAT YOU MAKE FOR 
EXAMPLE THAT TEMPERATURES HAVE NOT 
GONE UP IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SAYS 
LORD LAWSON IN HIS BOOK IS THAT 
TRUE 
THAT IS FACT WALLY TRUE TRUE THAT'S FASCINATING ISN'T IT 
ABSOLUTELY WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT 
WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID IS THAT THERE 
IS NATURAL VARIABILITY IN THE 
SYSTEM THE SUN DRIVES CHANGES IN 
THE SYSTEM BUT FOR THE LAST THIRTY 
YEARS OF THE LAST CENTURY AND NOW 
THE UNDERLYING TREND HAS FOLLOWED 
THE PREDICTION EXPECTED FROM MAN 
MADE GREENHOUSE WARMING 
WHAT I DO 
ACCEPT IS THAT ONE PART OF THE 
TOTAL TEMPERATURE DETERMINATION OF 
THE PLANET IS CARBON DIOXIDE 
CONCENTRATION IN THE ATMOSPHERE 
IT'S ONLY ONE PART EVEN THE 
INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE 
CHANGE DOESN'T SAY IT'S THE SOLE 
REASON I'M SURE CHRIS RAPLEY 
DOESN'T SAY IT'S THE SOLE REASON 
HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST US IF 
WE'RE GOING TO CUT BACK 
IF THAT'S 
THE CASE I'M AT A LOSS WHY YOU 
PROPOSE A CARBON TAX 
I SAY THAT 
THAT IF PEOPLE WANT A CARBON TAX 
NOT IN ADDITION TO OTHER FORMS OF 
TAXATION LET THEM DO IT YOU YOU JUSTIFY IT SAYING TO BE CARBON 
NEUTRAL 
YOU SHOULD CUT BACK NEUTRAL DRASTICALLY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
SHOULD CUT BACK DRASTICALLY ON 
THEIR CARBON EMISSIONS L. 
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SAY DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES AS WELL IF IT'S IN THE A 
GLEBL AGREEMENT IT WILL HAVE NO 
EFFECT IF INDIA AND CHINA WERE TO 
CUT BACK THEY'RE NOT GOING TO IT 
WOULD SLOW DOWN THEIR RATE OF 
GROWTH AND CONDEMN MANY MORE OF 
THEIR PEOPLE TO MALNUTRITION 
DISEASE DEATH AND ALL THE 
HARDSHIPS OF POVERTY THAN IS 
NECESSARY 
ALL PREFERRABLE TO NECESSARY CATASTROPHE ISN'T IT THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING CATASTROPHIC COMING WHAT WHAT ABOUT HIS POINT THAT DOING NOTHING 
IS PREFERRABLE TO DOING SOMETHING 
STUPID 
THAT'S RIGHT BUT DOING STUPID NOTHING IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IF 
THERE'S CATASTROPHE IN THE AIR WE 
HEAR EXPLANATIONS ABOUT THE 
UNCERTAINTIES AND INDEED ONE OF 
THE QUOTES IN THE BOOK IS THAT 
UNCERTAINTY IS UNCERTAINTY THAT 
CAN PLAY BOTH WAYS WE HAVE A NON 
LINEAR SYSTEM WHICH CAN REORGANISE 
ITSELF AND CAUSE US PROBLEMS IN 
FOOD SUPPLY WATER SUPPLY SEA 
LEVEL RISE WHAT WE'RE BEING ASKED 
TO DO IS SIT BACK WAIT AND SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS AND THEN LET THE 
MARKET MECHANISM SORT IT OUT L. 
DON'T THINK THAT'S ADEQUATE 
RESPONSE 
THERE'S NO REASON TO RESPONSE BELIEVE THERE'S A CATASTROPHE IN 
THE OFFING THERE AMAY BE A CHANGE 
WE SHOULD ADAPT TO THAT THAT'S 
WHAT MANKIND HAS ALWAYS DONE IN THE 
PAST THAT'S WHAT MANKIND DOES WE WE DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THE CHANGE WILL 
BE 
I TAKE THE MAJORITY VIEW HERE BE I SAY LET'S LOCK AT THE MAJORITY 
VIEW THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL 
ON CLIMATE CHANGE SAY THEIR BEST 
GUESS IS THAT OVER THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED 
YEARS THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN 
TEMPERATURES BETWEEN EIGHTEEN CENTIGRADE 
OR FOUR DEGREEDS CENTIGRADE LOOK AT 
THE CONCONSTITUENCYS AT THE UPPER 
END THERE ARE SOME BAD AND SOME 
VERY GOOD AS THEY ADMIT THEY 
ADMIT THAT FOOD PRODUCTION WILL BE 
ENHANCED BY UP TO THREE DEGREES 
INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE 
WHY ARE 
YOU RAISING YOUR EYEBROWS LIKE 
THAT 
IT SEEMS TO ME WHEN WE'RE THAT EMITING ONE THOUSAND TONS OF CARBON 
DIOXIDE A SECOND AS WE SPEAK AND WE 
HEAR THERE ARE FINITE LIMITS ON 
WHAT WE CAN INVEST BUT WE'RE NOT 
TOLD WHAT THE LIMITS ARE ON WHAT 
THE PLANET CAN TOLERATE WAIT TO 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS ISN'T AN ADEQUATE 
RESPONSE 
WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE RESPONSE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH 
I CAN SHOW YOU SOME OF TOMORROW 
NO I CAN'T I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT 
SOMETHING ABOUT TOMORROW'S 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME I'LL BE SHARING THE FIRST EVER 
TELEVISED DEBATE BETWEEN THE

GOOD NIGHT 
GOOD EVENING AFTER THE DAY'S 
SHOWERS AND WITH THE FROST NOW 
DEVELOPING WE'RE IN FOR A FEW 
PROBLEMS WITH ICE OVERNIGHT THERE 
COULD BE THE ODD MIST OR FOG PATCH 
MANY OF THE SHOWERS WILL DIMINISH 
IT'S A FROSTY START FOR MANY OF US 
NORTHERN SCOTLAND HAS PROBLEMS WITH 
SNOW OVER THE HIGHLANDS FALLING AS 
LOW AS ONE HUNDRED METRES IN PLACES A 
REALLY COLD DAY ACROSS NORTH 
EASTERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND THE RAIN 
SLIPS SOUTH THROUGH THE DAY 
FURTHER SOUTH IT SHOULD BE MORE 
STRAIGHTFORWARD SUNSHINE AND 
SHOWERS THERE WILL BE SUNSHINE 
AROUND FEWER SHOWERS THAN TODAY 
AT LOWER LEVELS MOST OF THEM 
FALLING AS RAIN RATHER THAN SLOT 
AND SNOW SLEET AND SNOW WITH 
SUNSHINE LIGHTER WINDS AGAIN 
TEMPERATURES COULD BE HIGHER THAN 
THOSE WE SAW ON MONDAY THERE WILL 
BE MORE SHOWERS AROUND COME THE 
AFTERNOON SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS FOR 
MANY OF US ON TUESDAY THAT THEME 
CONTINUES ON WEDNESDAY STILL A 
RATHER CHILLY THEME FOR THIS TIME 
OF YEAR AT LEAST TEMPERATURES ARE 
START TO SLOWLY CREEP UP YOU CAN 
SEE THE SAME IS TRUE FOR SOUTHERN 
AREAS WEDNESDAY SEES FURTHER 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS A COLD START 
AGAIN WITH ICE AROUND THE SNOW 
MOSTLY CONFINED TO THE HIS THERE 
WILL BE A PESTERING OF SHOWERS
