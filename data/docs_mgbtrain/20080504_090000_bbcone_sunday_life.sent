DAY I WAS MARRIED I WAS TWENTY ONE THERE 
I DIDN'T HAVE A WEDDING DRESS 
BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD ONE 
ME AND JOHN IN NEWQUAY WE WENT 
THERE FIVE YEARS AGO 
THIS IS WHEN I STARTED TO GET 
POORLY POORLY HELEN MILLER IS ON OXYGEN TWO HOURS 
A DAY SHE'S VIRTUALLY HOUSEBOUND 
WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED MUM AND DAD 
TOOK ME ON A CRUISE HERE IS THE 
LIQUID OXYGEN BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS ME 
AND I'M LOOKING AT ME NOW I WANT 
TO GET BACK TO LOOKING AND FEELING 
SOMETHING LIKE WITH MY MAKE UP ON 
AND JEWELLERY AND NICE CLOTHES AND 
SHOES SO 
MY MUM IS SO HARD WORKING SHE'S 
BUBBLY OPTIMISTIC AS YOU'VE 
PROBABLY SEEN ALREADY SHE REALLY 
IS AMAZING BEFORE SHE GOT ILL SHE 
WAS SO ACTIVE SHE'D DO ANYTHING 
FOR ANYBODY ALWAYS GO OUT OF HER 
WAY SINCE SHE'S ILL SHE CAN'T DO 
THAT IF THE ILLNESS ISN'T KILLING 
HER SAT DOWN WITH NOTHING TO DO IS 
KILLING HER 
WHEN HELEN WAS A 
TEENAGER SHE A OUGHT OWE IMMUNE 
DISEASE SHE WAS TOLD SHE WOULD 
NEVER HAVE KIDS BUT SHE HAD A FULL 
AND HEALTHY LIFE UNTIL FIVE YEARS 
AGO WHEN HE WAS JUST THIRTY THREE 
I THOUGHT I CAN'T BREATHE PROPERLY 
I JUST THOUGHT I'M NOT IN VERY 
GOOD CONDITION YOU KNOW L. WENT I 
MIGHT NEED TO DO MORE EXERCISE AND 
LOSE WEIGHT L. WAS GASPING WALKING 
UP THE STAIRS I WAS THINKING HAVE 
I ASTHMA AND AS TIME WENT ON AND 
MONTHS WENT ON I GRADUALLY FELT 
WORSE AND WORSE SO I DID SOME 
TESTS AND TWO WEEKS LATER I WENT 
BACK IN FOR THE RESULTS SHE TOOK 
ONE LOOK AT ME THE DOCTOR AND SHE 
SAID I THOUGHT I WAS COMING TO SEE 
AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD WOMAN BECAUSE THE 
RESULTS WERE THAT BAD 
HELEN WAS 
ZIEG NOSED WITH ETCH SEEMA SHE HAS 
TWENTY PER CENT OF HER LUNG CAPACITY NOW SHE 
FINDS THE THINGS WE TAKE FOR 
GRANTED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE GETTING 
UP GETTING DRESSED EVEN BRUSHING 
HER TEETH EXHAUSTS HER 
ONCE YOU 
HAVE EMPHYSEMA YOU CAN'T GET RID 
OF IT IT GRADUALLY GETS WORSE AND 
WORSE MY LIFE NOW HAS GOT TO A 
STAGE THAT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING I'M 
STRUGGLING TO BREATHE I CAN'T WALK 
I CAN'T I PHYSICALLY CAN'T DO 
ANYTHING WILL YOU JUST STOP THERE 
A MINUTE L. L. TEND TO RABBIT ON AND 
THEN MY BREATH CATCHES UP WITH ME 
AFTER A BIT 
HELEN NEEDS CONSTANT 
CARE AND IS LOOKED AFTER 
HER 
MUM AND DAD DURING THE DAY SHE'S 
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST FOR NEW 
LUNGS FOR A YEAR NOW 
I THOUGHT 
BEING NAIVE THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD 
A TRANSPLANT WITHIN THE FIRST FEW 
MONTHS BECAUSE THEY GEAR YOU UP TO 
SAY THE PHONE WILL RING T. CAN 
HAPPEN ANY TIME AS SOON AS WE GET 
ONE THAT IS COMPATIBLE WE WILL 
PHONE YOU UP AND YOU WILL COME IN 
AND HAVE IT DONE 
LAST YEAR HAS 
BEEN QUITE BAD BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY 
ON EDGE WAITING FOR THE PHONE TO G. 
WE DO HAVE REGULAR CALLS EVERY 
NIGHT MY GRANDDAD WILL RING AT TEN 
OR SOMETHING BUT IF ANYTHING RINGS 
AT SEVEN P. M. WE THINK THAT'S THE CALL 
THERE'S SO MUCH PRESSURE ON US WE 
CAN SEE MUM DETERIORATING BECAUSE 
ONE DAY UNLESS SHE'S THIS 
TRANSPLANT WE'LL WAKE UP AND SHE 
WILL BE DEAD THAT'S WHAT IS GOING 
TO HAPPEN IT IS NOT A SOB STORY 
IT IS JUST HARD THAT I'M ONLY EIGHTEEN 
AND MY BROTHER'S FOURTEEN AND WE WILL 
LOSE OUR MUM SOON 
RIGHT AT THE 
BEGINNING YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING 
TO GET SOME NEW LUNGS AND 
EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT AND 
WE'RE QUITE ON A HIGH MY HUSBAND 
AND MUM AND DAD AND THE KIDS WERE 
ON A HIGH BUT BECAUSE IT'S TAKEN 
SO LONG NOW 
TELL US WHY YOU 
NEED TO ANSWER 
I'M WAITING FOR MY 
TRANSPLANT AND I HAVE ALL MY 
PHONES SO I HAVE TO ANSWER IT 
HELLO HELLO CUT OFF EVERY TIME I 
FEEL SICK REFER TIME THAT PHONE 
RINGS THAT I'M NOT EXPECTING IT TO 
PHONE I THINK IS THAT IT IN IN FACT HELEN HAS ONLY HAD ONE CALL 
IN A YEAR 
ALL OF THE FAMILIES BAGS ARE PACKED 
AND LAST ACCEPTED THE PHONE RANG IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE EVENING SHE WAS 
ON HER WAY TO HOSPITAL WITHIN TEN 
MINUTES 
SIX FORTY FIVE P. M. WE WERE WAITING MINUTES AND UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THE 
TRANSPLANT CO ORDINATOR CAME IN 
THEY SAID THE LUNGS WERE DAMAGED 
SO I JUST I FELT GUTTED 
THE WAIT 
SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT 
AND I 
THINK THIS IS WHAT HER HUSBAND AND 
CHILDREN FIND REALLY REALLY 
DIFFICULT DIFFICULT IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING LIKE 
TERMINAL CANCER YOU KNOW MORE OR 
LESS WHAT SORT OF LIFE EXPECTANCY 
YOU'VE GOT WITH THIS IT'S OPEN 
ENDED AND COULD GO EITHER WAY SHE 
COULD GET A TRANSPLANT AND HAVE A 
NUMBER OF MORE YEARS OR SHE COULD 
JUST GRADUALLY FADE AND THE 
TRANSPLANT MIGHT NEVER COME 
HELEN'S PROBLEM IS THERE AREN'T 
ENOUGH PEOPLE ON THE DONOR REGISTER 
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO BRING IN AN 
OPT OUT SCHEME WHERE ORGANS ARE 
AUTOMATICALLY DONATED UNLESS A 
PERSON HAS SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN TO 
OPT OUT 
BECAUSE THE SUBJECT IS SO OPT OUT EMOTIVE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WHEN 
IT COMES TO A TIME WHEN A LOVED ONE 
IS DYING THAT WE HAVE THE EMOTIONS 
TO COPE WITH THE THOUGHT OF SAYING 
YES YOU CAN TAKE MY LOVED ONES 
ORGANS I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU 
BECAUSE YOU'RE LOSING SOMEONE AT 
THAT TIME L. WOULD LIKE SOME 
EMOTION TO BE TAKEN OUT L. THINK 
WHAT THIS SCHEME IS INTENDED FOR 
IS THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LIKE 
A LOT OF MY FRIENDS HAVE SAID OF 
COURSE YOU CAN HAVE MY ORGANS BUT 
HAVE THEY TOLD SOMEBODY THAT HAVE 
THEY SIGNED A DOCUMENT TO SAY THAT 
THIS SCHEME IS FOR THOSE SORTS OF 
PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 
GIFT OF LIFE AND PEOPLE HELPING 
EACH OTHER IN TODAY'S SOCIETY 
WHAT BETTER THING IS THAT THAT TO 
HELP SOMEBODY LIVE AGAIN WELL WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HELEN CALLED 
THE GIFT OF LIFE WE'RE JOINED BY 
LIZ BABOUMYAN SHE HAD TO MAKE THE 
DECISION FOR HER DAUGHTER'S ORGANS 
TO BE USEDTOR A TRANSPLANT 
AND KEITH RIGG 
LIZ LET'S TALK ABOUT MILL LENA 
SHE WAS YOUNG FIFTEEN WHEN SHE DIED 
WHAT HAPPENED 
O. K. IT WAS THREE 
WEEKS AFTER HER FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY 
SUNDAY MORNING SHE WOKE UP WITH A 
BIT OF A HEADACHE TEMPERATURE A 
BIT OF A FLU BUG GOING AROUND THAT 
TIME IT WAS FEBRUARY SO EVERYONE 
HAD SOME KIND OF BUG SO WE THOUGHT 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT SHE 
DETERIORATED THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
VOMITING THEN SHE SLIPPED IN AND 
OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS BY THE 
AFTERNOON SHE WELL WE COULDN'T 
WAKE HER BASICALLY SHE JUST SLEPT 
FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES WE COULDN'T 
SHAKE HER SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE 
LOCAL HOSPITAL MANCHESTER ROYAL 
INFIRMARY AND SHE DID A SCAN AT 
THAT MOMENT AND FOUND THERE WAS A 
CYST GROWING IN HER BRAIN THAT NO 
ONE KNEW ABOUT THE CANAL THAT 
DRAINS THE FLUID OFF THE BRAIN IS 
VERY VERY NARROW AND THE CYST WAS 
GROWING IN THE NARROWIST PART 
BECAUSE THAT WAS BLOCKED THERE WAS 
A BUILD UP OF FLUID ON THE BRAIN 
AND YOU KNOW CONSEQUENTLY MALINA 
BECAME BRAIN DAMAGED SHE WAS THEN 
RUSHED TO THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL 
WHERE A BRAIN SURGE OPERATED HER TO 
REMOVE THE FLUID BUT THEY TOLD ME 
AFTERWARDS THAT BECAUSE OF THE 
AMOUNT OF FLUID THAT CAME OFF HER 
BRAIN YOU KNOW SHE WAS WITH VERY 
BADLY BRAIN DAMAGED IF SHE WOKE UP 
IT WASN'T GOING TO BE MY DAUGHTER 
A FEW HOURS LATER BASICALLY SHE 
SLIPPED AWAY FROM US 
YOU HAD 
TALKED TO HER BEFOREHAND ABOUT 
ORGAN DONATION WHAT WAS THE 
CONTROVERSIAL 
CONVERSATION WE CONTROVERSIAL WATCHED A PROGRAMME ON ORGAN 
DONATION ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE 
SHE DIED WE WERE SKIPPING THROUGH 
THE DIGITAL PROGRAMMES AND HAPPENED 
TO VIEW THIS PROGRAMME SHE WANTED 
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHY THIS 
PROGRAMME WAS BEING AIRED AND WHAT 
THE SIGNIFICANCE WAS MELINA HAD 
ONE KIDNEY SHE LOST ONE OF HER 
KIDNEYS WHEN SHE WAS TWO YEARS OLD 
TO AN INFECTION SO SHE KNEW EVEN 
AT THAT TENDER AGE OF FOURTEEN AND HAD 
THE INTELLIGENCE TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT IF SHE LOST HER ONLY KIDNEY 
HER ONE FUNCTIONING KIDNEY SHE 
WOULD RELY ON OTHER ANOTHER PERSON 
TO RELY ON DONATING THEIR KIDNEY 
AFTER THE PROGRAMME SHE SAID WHEN 
I GROW OLDER I'M GOING TO JOIN THE 
DONOR REGISTER 
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY 
WITHIN THE HOSPITAL AND THEY 
PRONOUNCED HER DEAD WAS IT 
DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DECISION TO THE 
DOCTORS 
NO CONSIDER MYSELF DOCTORS FORTUNATE IF THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD 
IN THAT 
THE IMPORTANCE OF ORGAN 
DONATION AND I KNEW SHE WANTED TO 
DONATE HER ORGANS IF ANYTHING 
HAPPENED TO HER 
WHEN THE DOCTORS TOOK ME INTO A 
SIDE ROOM AND MELINA WAS THERE ON 
THE LIFE SUPPORT I COULD SEE IN 
THEIR FACES AND EYES WHAT THEY WERE 
GOING TO ASK ME 
I THOUGHT I'M NOT GOING TO PUT THEM 
THROUGH THIS I KNOW FOR A FACT 
MELINA WANTED TO BE A ON ORGAN 
DONOR AND READILY OFFERED HER 
ORGANS UP FOR DONATION 
SHE WENT ON 
TO HELP FIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE SHE SHE Z. 
HAVING BEEN THROUGH THIS IS Z. THERE A MORAL OBLIGATION ON PEOPLE 
TO DONATE ORGANS HOW DO YOU FEEL 
WELL I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT IF 
WE'RE ALL IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WE'D EACH NEED AN ORGAN AT SOME 
TIME BECAUSE OF AN INFECTION WE 
WOULD LIKE TO THINK THERE'S AN 
ORGAN OUT THERE FOR US WE WOULD BE 
HAPPY TO TAKE SO WE SHOULD BE 
HAPPY TO GIVE IN THAT RESPECT 
KEITH HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO ASK 
ANYBODY 
FOR ANY OF THE RELATIVES FOR THE ORGANS OF ANY OF THE 
DECEASED FAMILY MEMBERS 
I HAVE 
DONE MANY YEARS AGO NOW IT IS 
DONE BY PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED 
TRANSPLANT CO ORDINATORS AND 
SENIOR DOCTORS AND NURSES ON WARDS 
TO TALK THROUGH WHAT THE WISHES ARE 
OF THE LOVEDED ONES TO MAKE THE 
DECISION 
SHOULD THERE BE A MORAL DECISION SENSE TO BE SIGNING UP FOR ORGAN 
DONATION 
WE ALL NEED TO BE ABLE TO DONATION MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE SOME 
PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE NOT TO WE HOPE 
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE 
ON THE ORGAN DONOR REGISTER THE 
IMPORTANT THING IS PEOPLE TALK 
ABOUT IT WHILST THEY'RE ALIVE WITH 
THEIR FAMILY 
THE GOVERNMENT IS 
CONSIDERING AT THE MOMENT A SYSTEM 
OF PRESUMED CONSENT THAT WOULD 
MEAN YOU WOULD HAVE TO OPT OUT IF 
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DONATE WHAT IS 
YOUR TAKE ON THAT BECAUSE 
PRESUMABLY YOU NEED MORE ORGANS 
YOU WOULD EXPECT ME TO BE IN FAVOUR 
IT IS A MORE COMPLEX ISSUE THAN 
MEETS THE EYE IT NEEDS TO BE 
THOUGHT THROUGH CAREFULLY THAT THE 
PUBLIC NEED TO BE AWARE OF IT 
PROFESSIONALS NEED TO BE AWARE OF 
IT AND THERE NEEDS TO BE DEBATE 
IT SEEMS LIKE A SIMPLE SOLUTION 
THOUGH DOESN'T IT 
IT SEEMS TO BE 
BUT WE HAVE A NEW HUMAN TISSUE ACT 
IN PLACE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS 
WHERE THE CONSENT IS A PRIMARY 
BASIS BECAUSE OF THAT IN THE LIGHT 
OF ALDDER HAY AND BRISTOL THERE'S 
MISTRUST WHICH IS WHY THE ACT 
COMES IN PLAY 
THRIFPLT IS CONCERN WITH PRESUMED 
CONSENT THE PEOPLE MOVE TOWARDS 
THE TAKING OF ORGANS RATHER THAN 
GIVING ORGANS AND MRS. A MISTRUST 
OF GOVERNMENT SO THEREFORE THERE 
NEEDS TO BE FAR MORE DEBATE PUBLIC 
INFORMATION TO ALLOW THIS TO 
HAPPEN NOW I DON'T THINK IS THE 
RIGHT TIME BUT MAYBE IN A FEW 
YEARS' TIME AND WHEN THE TASK FORCE 
IS LOOKING AT THIS HAS A CHANCE TO 
REPORT T. MAY BE THE RIGHT TIME IN A 
FEW YEARS' TIME PEOPLE NEED TO 
THINK THROUGH IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT PRESUMED 
CONSENT 
I HAVE MY CONCERNS AT THE CONSENT MOMENT THERE IS A HUGE SHORTAGE OF 
ORGANS IN MY EYES IT IS DOWN TO A 
LACK OF COMMUNICATION PROMOTION 
AND AWARENESS IF WE ARE GOING TO 
GO FOR PRESUMED CONSENT WHAT 
DIFFERENCE WOULD THERE BE IN 
COMMUNICATING TO THE PUBLIC HOW TO 
OPT OUT I WANT THAT GUARANTEE 
THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING TO TALK 
TO US 
INDEED WE WANT YOUR VIEWS ON THIS 
SUBJECT DO YOU THINK ORGAN 
DONATION SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC OR IS 
THAT AN ABUSE OF YOUR PERSONAL 
RIGHTS HERE IS HOW TO CONTACT US 
NOW YOU MAY REMEMBER TWO WEEKS AGO 
WE INTRODUCED YOU TO THE SANDERSON 
FAMILY THEY HAVE BEEN RECRUITED BY 
SUNDAY LIFE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT 
BRITAIN'S MAIN RELIGIONS LAST 
NIGHT WE SENT THEM ON THEIR FIRST 
ASSIGNMENT THEY MET WITH A SIKH 
FAMILY TO CELEBRATE ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT FAMILIES FESTIVALS IN 
SIKHISM SIKHISM TODAY WE ARE IN BIRMINGHAM FOR 
BAISAKHI A SIKH FESTIVAL WE ARE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO FINDING OUT 
ABOUT THE SIKH RELIGION THIS IS 
VAISAKHI BEING CELEBRATED IN 
BIRMINGHAM SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND A SEA 
OF ORANGE IT IS A SPECTACLE FOR 
ANYONE BUT IF YOU ARE SIKH IT IS 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DATES IN 
THE CALENDAR 
IT IS COMING TO BE 
REALLY NICE TO LEARN ABOUT A NEW 
FAITH A FAITH WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY 
NOTHING ABOUT WE ARE STARTING FROM 
SCRATCH 
VAISAKHI MARKS THE DAY SCRATCH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN 
SIKHISM BECAME THE COLLECTIVE FAITH 
AND IT IS ALSO THE SIKH NEW YEAR 
IT IS A CELEBRATION FOR ALL THE 
FAMILY AND A FAMILY FROM EDGBASTON 
HAVE AGREED TO BE THE SANDERSONS' 
GUIDES 
LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
WE ARE GUIDES THE SANDERSONS 
THEY ARE GOING TO 
DO THEIR BEST TO ANSWER ALL OF 
THEIR QUESTIONS 
I NOTICE THAT A 
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WEARING TURBANS 
AND SCARVES AND OTHER HEADGEAR IS 
THERE A PARTICULAR ITS SYMBOLISM 
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED ON THE 
PROCESSION THERE WAS AN OPEN AIR 
TRUCK ON THAT THERE WAS A HOLY 
BOOK IT WAS REALLY A SIGN OF 
RESPECT THAT YOU COVER YOUR HEAD 
AND WHY ORANGE L. CAN SEE IT EVERYWHERE 
SAFFRON IS THE NATIONAL EVERYWHERE SIKH COLOUR YOU CAN DISTINGUISH A 
SIKH VERY EASIER EASILY 
AND THE 
BEARD THERE IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT 
ABOUT THEM PRESUMABLY 
ONE OF THE 
TENETS OF SIKHISM IS NOT TO CUT ANY 
BODILY HAIR YOU TEND TO FIND THAT 
SIKHS WE HAVE LONG HAIR AND BEARDS 
IS TODAY AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR WHAT 
YOU DO YOU COME EVERY YEAR 
WE DO 
TEND TO COME EVERY YEAR WE ARE NOT 
ALWAYS ABLE TO STAY FOR THE WHOLE 
THING BUT HOPEFULLY TODAY THE 
WEATHER WILL BE KIND AND WE CAN 
STAY FOR LONGER 
VAISAKHI ISN'T 
JUST ABOUT RELIGION IT ALSO 
CELEBRATES THE CULTURE OF THE 
PUNJAB IN INDIA WHERE SIKHISM 
STARTED WHICH MEANS MARTIAL ARTS 
DANCING AND FOOD 
ARE YOU HUNGRY 
WE WILL GO AND GET SOME FOOD 
IT LOOKS DELICIOUS IT TASTES 
BETTER THAN IT LOOKS 
YOU SHOULDN'T 
SAY THAT 
THIS IS A POOR POORER IT 
TASTES GORGEOUS 
OH YES 
IS THAT 
NICE IT IS FRIED POTATO PAT 
BORER 
DOES THE FOOD HAVE A BORER PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE 
I THINK 
THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE AS OPPOSED 
TO A RELIGIOUS ONE FOOD BRINGS 
PEOPLE TOGETHER 
IN A TENT AT THE 
CENTRE OF THE FESTIVAL IS A HOLY 
TEMPLE WHERE FOLLOWERS 
BEFORE 
THE SANDERSONS CAN GO THEY NEED 
TO OBSERVE SOME RELIGIOUS 
TRADITIONS 
THAT IS TO COVER YOUR TRADITIONS HEAD WE WILL TAKE OUR SHOES OFF 
WHEN WE GO INSIDE AND GO FORWARD 
AND BASLE L. WILL PULL IT UP IN THE 
SECOND GO FORWARD AND BASLE 
PERFECT HE HAS FINALLY GOT SOME 
STYLE GO FORWARD AND BOW IN IN HERE DEVOTEES PAID RESPECT TO THE 
MAIN THRONE WHERE THE HOLY BOOK OF 
SIKH SCRIPTURES 
FOR 
SILENT PRAYER 
DONATION AND 
A HUMBLE EVERYONE WHO PASSES 
GIVEN A SMALL AND OUT FOOD AS 
THEY LEAVE TO SYMBOLISE THAT THEY 
ARE ALL EQUAL IN THE EYES OF GOD 
A SMALL AMOUNT OF FOOD THIS IDEA 
IS CENTRAL TO ANOTHER SIKH 
TRADITION WHERE FOOD IS SHARED WITH 
EVERYONE PRESENT REGARDLESS OF 
RELIGION CLASS RACE OR COLOUR 
THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE 
SO MANY THINGS THAT YOU COULD PICK 
OUT ABOUT IT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS 
THEY ARE EQUAL NO MATTER HOW POOR 
OR RICH YOU ARE WE ARE ALL EQUAL 
TOGETHER IT WAS INCREDIBLE 
A LOT 
OF THE FOOD WE WERE EATING IN THERE 
IS THE FOOD PEOPLE HAVE BROUGHT AND 
PAID FOR THEMSELVES AND ARE GIVING 
OUT THEY ARE KEEN TO MAKE SURE 
THEY GIVE IT OUT BECAUSE THEY WILL 
FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEMSELVES ELLA ELLA ASKED WHY WE WERE BOWLING 
IT IS TO 
MAKE YOURSELF LESS IMPORTANT THAN 
GOD BOWING YOU MAKE YOURSELF 
LOWER THAN GOD 
COE WAS SCARED 
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT 
WRONG AND OFFEND ANYBODY BUT IT 
WAS NICE AND SPIRITUAL I WAS 
SCARED 
THE DAILY IS DRAWING TO A SCARED CLOSE AND IT IS TIME FOR THE 
FAMILIES TO SAY GOODBYE THE DAY 
SO WHAT DO THE SANDERSONS MAKE OF 
VAISAKHI 
IT IS AMAZING HOW VAISAKHI DIFFERENT IT WAS TO ANYTHING WE 
HAVE REALLY EVER EXPERIENCED THEY 
REALLY HELP US IT WAS MUCH BETTER 
FROM A FAMILY PERSPECTIVE A REALLY 
ENJOYED IT 
IT WAS A FAITH THAT 
WOULD BE QUITE CLOSE TO OUR HEARTS 
BECAUSE IT MAY BE SEEN TO BE ABOUT 
THE VALUES AND ABOUT RESPECT AND 
EQUALITY ME MAINLY SEEMS TO BE 
ABOUT THE VALUES 
THERE IS SO MUCH 
TODAY THAT IS INCREDIBLY DOWN TO 
EARTH ABOUT LOOKING AFTER EACH 
OTHER CARING FOR EACH OTHER AND 
ALL THOSE CORE VALUES THAT I THINK 
ALL RELIGIONS PROBABLY SHARE NOW NOW WE KNOW A LOT 
WE DO KNOW A LOT 
PLAYING HOST TO A FAMILY OUTSIDE 
THEIR FAITH HAS ALSO BEEN A 
POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR THE SIKH 
FAMILY 
SOMETIMES I THINK WE TAKE FAMILY OUR CULTURE AND HERITAGE FOR 
GRANTED IT IS RICH AND DIVERSE 
EXPLAINING A LOT OF WHAT WE DO 
BROUGHT SOME OF THE REALITIES BACK 
TO US SO IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE 
FOR US AS WELL THEY HAVE ALSO FELT 
THEY HAD SET A NEW TREND FOR THEIR 
FATHER WITH THE BANDANA CERTAINLY 
HE WILL BE WEARING THAT MORE OFTEN 
LOTS OF INTERESTING FACTS COME OUT 
OF THERE 
THERE IS LOTS MORE ON THE 
WEBSITE 
INDEED WE WILL BE SENDING WEBSITE THE SANDERSON FAMILY FOR ANOTHER 
EXPERIENCE VERY SOON 
WE HAVE HAD 
LOTS OF REACTION FROM YOU TO LAST 
WEEK'S PROGRAMME ONE STORY CAUGHT 
YOUR EYE JACK HAMMOND THE EIGHTY EIGHT 
YEAR OLD MAN WHOSE SON ADVERTISED 
FOR SOME FRIENDS FOR HIM 
I WROTE 
WANTED PERSON TO TAKE OUT ELDERLY 
GENTLEMAN TO THE PUB FOR A DRINK 
THEN THE PHONE WENT CRAZY WE HAVE 
HAD LOADS AND LOADS OF OFFERS FOR 
THE JOB WE HAD CHOSEN TWO SO YES 
IT HAS ALL WORKED WE HAVE CHOSEN 
HE WAS MISERABLE AND HE IS NOT 
MISERABLE NOW 
THERE YOU GO I HAVE SOME AS WELL 
HERE'S ONE FROM FAYE ELLIOTT SHE 
WAS INSPIRED BY THE ADOPT A GRANNY 
SCHEME WE FEATURED C. SAYS SHE 
SAYS I AM 
GRANDMOTHER AND GREAT GRANDMOTHER BUT I HAVE ENOUGH LOVE 
TO GO ROUND TO MORE GRANDPARENT 
LESS CHILDREN L. DON'T SEE MY 
FAMILY VERY OFTEN SO I WOULD LOVE 
TO BE INVOLVED WITH ANOTHER FAMILY 
THAT WAS AN E. MAIL SOMEBODY PHONED 
AND SAID IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO 
HAVE SUPERVISED CARE FOR OLDER 
PEOPLE LINKED TO CHILDREN'S 
NURSERIES SO THOSE TWO GROUPS COULD 
HAVE CONTACT 
WE HAD THIS REACTION 
FROM ANOTHER VIEWER THEY SAID IT 
WAS A SHAME A SON HAD TO ADVERTISE 
FOR HIS LONELY DAD TO HAVE SOME 
COMPANY I WAS BORN IN INDIA AND 
CAME HERE IN THE SIXTIES L. AM SAD TO 
SEE HOW SOME ELDERLY RELATIVES ARE 
TREATED BY THEIR NEIGHBOURS THANK THANK YOU FOR THIS ONE CONTACT THE 
ELDERLY SAY THAT THEY ORGANISED 
MONTHLY SUNDAY AFTERNOON ACTIVITIES 
FOR ISOLATED ELDERLY PEOPLE THEY 
HAVE THREE HUNDRED GROUPS AND ARE ALWAYS 
LOOKING FOR TO START MORE YOU CAN 
FIND A LINK TO THEM THROUGH THE 
WEBSITE IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU 
WANT TO SAY ABOUT TODAY'S SHOW 
PLEASE GET IN TOUCH 
THE I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GOING 
TO GET ALL OF THAT OUT IT WAS MOUTHFUL 
AS ALWAYS WE LOOK FORWARD TO 
HEARING YOUR VIEWS COMING UP THE 
SINGING ANGELS WHO WOULD RATHER 
STUDY THEN PARTY 
AND THE CHURCH 
THAT ONLY EXISTS ON THE INTERNET 
WHEN I TRY AND TELL MY OWN CHURCH 
ABOUT THIS INTERNET CHURCH THEY 
THINK I AM SLIGHTLY MAD 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS TO 
SEE WHAT ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS 
ISSUES HAVE CROPPED UP MARILYN 
SLOPE MARILYN STOWE AND 
JOURNALIST AND BROADCASTER MARTYN 
KELTON ARE HERE PARTICULARLY 
INTERESTING YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT 
THE MCCANNS LOTS OF TALK ABOUT 
THEM WHAT ARE YOU INTERESTED IN I I AM INTERESTED IN THE POSITIVE IN 
THEIR STORY IT SEEMS THAT AS THE 
COUPLE THEY ARE STICKING TOGETHER 
THEY ARE VERY RECEPTIVE TO THEIR 
FAITH I THINK AS A CONSEQUENCE I 
SINCERELY HOPE THEY STAY TOGETHER 
YOU SPECIALISE IN DIVORCE LAW SO 
YOU SEE A LOT OF COUPLES AND A LOT 
OF PRESSURE 
ADVERSITY CAN OFTEN 
BREAK A MARRIAGE BUT THESE TWO MAKE 
A SHOW OF HOLDING HANDS IN PUBLIC 
BEING A COUPLE AT A TIME WHEN 
SURELY THE RECRIMINATIONS MUST BE 
SO SO GOING ON ALL THE TIME L. 
JUST THINK THAT IF THEY CAN GET 
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER GOOD FOR 
THEM 
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE UNUSUAL THEM IN THAT 
I THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE 
IF YOU SEE PEOPLE UNDER SUCH 
INTENSE PRESSURE IN THESE HIGH 
PROFILE CASES OFTEN SADLY THEY 
TOOK SPLIT UP THE SARAH PAYNE CASE 
AND LOTS OF CASES LIKE THAT THEY 
HAVE HAD A FOCUS THEY HAVE HAD 
LOTS OF CRITICISM BECAUSE OF THE P. R. 
CAMPAIGN THAT HAS GONE ON BUT THAT 
IS THE FOCUS AS LONG AS THERE IS 
HOPE AND THEY ARE FOCUSING ON THAT 
THAT WILL KEEP THEM TOGETHER EVEN 
THE ARGUIDO THING A HORRENDOUS 
EXPERIENCE FOR THEM SEEMS TO HAVE 
BROUGHT THEM CLOSER TOGETHER 
INTERESTING BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW 
SHE HAS STRONG CATHOLIC FAITH AS 
WELL DOESN'T SHE PRESUMABLY THAT 
IS HELPING 
THE TWO THINGS ARE 
PROBABLY IN TANDEM BUT BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE AND THE FACT THEY ARE 
HAVING THIS CAMPAIGN AND ALSO THE 
FAITH THE FOCUS THEY HAVE THIS THIS IS A STORY FROM THE OBSERVER WEBB 
DIVORCES TELL ME A BIT MORE 
APPARENTLY IN PORTUGAL YOU CAN GET 
A DIVORCE ON THE WEB IN A MATTER OF 
HOURS 
JUST HOURS AM NOT A FAN HOURS OF FAULT IN DIVORCE THINK IT 
SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF IT BUT I 
WORRY ABOUT BEING ABLE TO GET A 
DIVORCE WITHIN HOURS 
IT IS BAD 
BUSINESS FOR YOU 
IT IS BUT EVEN 
WORSE FRAUD CHILDREN FINANCE 
VERY WORRYING 
YOU SAY FRAUD WHY 
SOMEBODY COULD FIND THEMSELVES 
BEING DIVORCED WITHOUT KNOWING 
ABOUT IT IF IT IS JUST GOING TO 
TAKE COUPLE OF PALS FILING SOME 
DOCUMENTS THEY COULD FIND 
THEMSELVES DIVORCED COUPLE OF HOURS 
IT IS LIKE A FILM I HAVE HOURS SEEN RECENTLY SOME PEOPLE WATCHING 
WOULD SAY THANK GOODNESS I DON'T 
HAVE TO PAY LAWYERS IT IS A GOOD 
THING I THINK MARILYN WILL TAKE TELL 
YOU THEY STILL HAVE 
TO PAY TO GET EVERYTHING SORTED OUT 
I THINK THEY SHOULD MAKE MARRIAGE 
HARDER RATHER THAN DIVORCE EASIER 
THESE THINGS MOVE SO FAST YOU 
START A RELATIONSHIP YOU MAY BE 
LIVING TOGETHER AND THEN YOU THINK 
LET'S GET MARRIED L. THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF 
QUESTIONNAIRE THAT TRIES TO 
ESTABLISH THAT A COUPLE AREN'T JUST 
GETTING MARRIED BECAUSE THEY WANT A 
BIG PARTY MAYBE THEY GO THROUGH 
FEW HOOPS TO SOME SYDOW COOK AND 
THEN THEY ARE ALLOWED TO GET 
MARRIED 
IF YOU DO IT THAT QUICKLY MARRIED IF IT TAKES A LONGER TIME PERHAPS 
YOU MIGHT THINK TWICE YES 
PART OF YES THE JOB OF BEING A LAWYER IS TO SEE 
WHETHER A COUPLE REALLY DO WANT TO 
GET DIVORCED AND CONSIDER WITH THEM 
OTHER OPTIONS TO TRY AND SAVE THE 
MARRIAGE SO THIS GOES WITH IT 
LOTS IN THE PAPERS ABOUT JOSEF 
FRITZL IN AUSTRIA THE SUNDAY 
PAPERS ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT 
AUSTRIA CONCERNS ABOUT WHY THIS IS 
HAPPENING IN THEIR COUNTRY 
OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE PAST 
AUSTRIA HAS EVERYTHING DURING THE 
THIRTIES BUT ALSO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT 
THIS STORY THE COVERAGE SEEMS A 
BIT GHOULISH TO ME WE ARE 
FASCINATED BY IT IT IS 
EXTRAORDINARY I JUST WONDER 
WHETHER SOME OF THE DETAILS WE ARE 
GETTING WE ARE HEARING FROM 
NEIGHBOURS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO 
WERE SILENT FOR SO MANY YEARS WE 
ARE GETTING MAYBE MORE DETAILED 
THAN WE USED FOR LEE MEAD L. AM 
WONDERING WHETHER THERE IS AN 
ELEMENT OF GHOULISHNESS WE USED 
FOR LEE MEAD 
SOME PEOPLE SAYING 
THEY KNEW THAT THINGS WERE GOING ON 
IT IS CONCERNING THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T 
SAY ANYTHING 
IT IS AN EXTREME CASE OF CHILD 
ABUSE CHILD ABUSE HAPPENS IN EVERY 
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND THIS 
COUNTRY IT SEEMS TO ME THE MESSAGE 
OF THIS IS DON'T LOOK THE OTHER WAY 
CHILDREN NEED PROTECTION WHEREVER 
THEY ARE IF YOU THINK THAT 
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT 
DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT 
CULTURE IN THIS COUNTRY 
IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO SAY 
THINGS GO 
UNNOTICED 
THINGS GO UNNOTICED AND UNNOTICED PEOPLE TEND TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY 
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT CAN'T 
POSSIBLY BE HAPPENING PEOPLE HAVE 
TO OPEN THEIR EYES AND CHILDREN 
ARE BEING ABUSED 
IT WOULD 
DANGEROUS TO SAY IT IS ONLY AUSTY 
AND SMUG TO SAY FACTS OUT OF 
JERSEY AND SEVERAL OTHER THINGS 
ALTHOUGH THE AUSTRIANS ARE BEATING 
THEMSELVES UP A BIT 
YOU QUICKLY 
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE 
INTERESTING STORY ABOUT TKPWRE 
GOREIAN CHANTING HELPING PEOPLE 
IT IS THE HEAVENLY WAY TO STRESS 
RELIEF TKPWRE GOREIAN CHANTING IS 
GOOD TO RELIEF CITY LOTS OF PEOPLE 
HAVE TAKEN IT UP 
IT IS NOT JUST 
THAT CHANTING THAT WOULD WORK 
ANYBODY CHANTING OR BREATHING 
TECHNIQUES 
YOU CAN SEE WHY THEY'RE TECHNIQUES STRESSED MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE 
TRIED IT AT NORTHERN ROCK THANK THANK YOU YOU THOSE ARE THE VIEWS OF OUR GUESTS 
YOUR THOUGHTS PLEASE TELL US 
NOW THIS IS SEF SALEM YOU MIGHT 
NOT ADMIRE HIS FASHION STYLE BUT 
YOU PROBABLY AGREE HE HAS THE 
RIGHT TO DRESS AS HE CHOOSES THIS 
WEEK TWO TEENAGERS WERE SENTENCE 
TODAY LIFE IN PRISON FOR BEATING 
TO DEATH TWENTY YEAR OLD GOTH SOPHIE 
LANCASTER SIXLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY 
SHE LOOKED SIMPLY 
SOPHIE LANCASTER AND HER BOYFRIEND 
WERE BRUTALLY ATTACKED SOPHIE WAS 
BEATEN SO BADLY SHE LIPPED INTO A 
COMA AND NEVER REGAINED 
CONSCIOUSNESS ROBERT SURVIVED BUT 
HAS BEEN LEFT TRAUMATISED THE 
CRIME SENT SHOCK WAVES THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY A GOODBYE 
KISS FROM THE BOYFRIEND SHE'D BEEN 
TRYING TO PROTECT 
LIKE THOSE FRIENDS AT HER FUNERAL 
SHE DRESSED IN THE GOTH STYLE AND 
IT SEEMS IT COST HERBERT LIFE 
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BRENDAN HARRIS AND SIXTEEN 
YEAR OLD RYAN HERBERT WERE JAILED 
FOR LIFE FOR SOPHIE'S MURDER THIS 
WEEK HER DEATH RAISES SERIOUS 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TYPE OF SOCIETY 
WE HAVE IN BRITAIN HERE IN 
MANCHESTER JUST AROUND THE CORNER 
FROM SOPHIE'S TOWN THERE ARE MANY 
GOTHS WHO WERE SHOCKED BY HER DEATH 
HOW DO THEY FEEL NOW STILL HANGING 
OUT IN THE CITY CENTRE DRESSED THE 
WAY THEY DO 
SOME OF THE WORST 
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IS I HAD 
A GLASS BOTTLE THROWN AT ME WHICH 
NARROWLY MISSED ME PEOPLE TRIED TO 
TRIP ME UP WALKING INTO ME AND 
NASTY COMMENTS 
IT MAKES ME NOT 
WANT TO BE MYSELF WANT TO HIDE AND 
BLEND IN AND BE NORMAL BECAUSE I 
DON'T WANT TO BE ABUSED GOTHS GOTHS EMERGED OUT OF THE POST PUNK ERA 
AND THEY LIKE THE DARK SIDE OF LIFE 
SOME DRESS IN BLACK DYE THEIR HAIR 
AND BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS 
THEIR INDIVIDUAL WALLET BEEN 
INDIVIDUALALITY INDIVIDUALALITY A CHURCH IN MANCHESTER HAS OPENED 
ITS DOORS TO HAVE A SAFE PLACE 
COLIN HELPED ORGANISE THESE 
GATHERINGS 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE A GATHERINGS TEENAGER YOU WANT A GROUP TO 
BELONG TO DO NOT YOU AND THIS ONE 
WORKED FOR ME EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS 
QUITE EXTREME SO WE LIKE VAMPIRES 
AND GHOSTS AND BLOOD AND FANNINGS 
AND THEN WE'LL FLOUNS INTO A CORNER 
AND WRITE A POEM ABOUT HOW SAD WE 
ARE OR SOMETHING 
IT'S BEEN NINE 
MONTHS SINCE THE MURDER OF SOPHIE 
OUTSIDE THE HAVEN OF THIS CHURCH 
NOTHING SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED JOHN 
OWEN WAS THE VICTIM OF AN 
UNPROVOKED ATTACK 
I CAN HER THEM 
PUMPING ME JUMPING ON MY HEAD AND 
LAUGHING I WAS ABSOLUTELY 
TERRIFIED AND I NEVER FELT LIKE 
THAT BEFORE L. NEVER HAD THAT KIND 
OF FEAR IT WAS A PIERCING FEAR 
THROUGH MY WHOLE BODY JOHN JOHN SUFFERED A BROKEN NOSE AND TRACK 
FUERD WRIST BUT REFUSES TO GIVE 
INTO THE INTIMIDATION 
MAYBE I 
WOULD CONSIDER CHANGING MY IMAGE 
BUT THEN I THOUGHT NO IF I CHANGE 
WHO I AM I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG 
WHY SHOULD I CHANGE MYSELF FOR THEM 
T. IS THEM WHO NEED TO LOOK AT 
THEMSELVES AND CHANGE 
THAT VIEW IS 
ECHOED IN THE GOTH COMMUNITY WHO 
HAVE NO THOUGHT TO RESORTING TO 
VIOLENCE THEMSELVES OVER THE ATTACK 
ON SOPHIE 
THERE'S NOT PACKS OF 
GOTHS SEEKING REVENGE WE'RE ALL 
JUST FEELING REALLY SAD 
AND TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO 
SUPPORT HER FAMILY 
SOPHIE LANCASTER'S MUM SYLVIA IS 
HERE SHE'S STARTED A FOUNDATION TO 
TEACH PEOPLE RESPECT AND TOLERANCE 
FOR OTHERS AND HERE IS SOPHIE'S 
BEST FRIEND SUZANNE AND KATE 
GREENWOOD AND SETH GOOD MORNING 
TO YOU ALL SYLVIA TELL US A BIT 
ABOUT SOPHIE AND WHY SHE DRESSED 
THE WAY SHE DID 
SHE DRESSED THE 
WAY SHE DID BECAUSE SHE WAS A 
CREATIVE YOUNG WOMAN IT REFLECTED 
WHAT SHE WAS LIKE INSIDE BASICALLY 
AND SHE WANTED TO SHOW PEOPLE SHE 
WAS AN INDIVIDUAL SOPHIE WAS SHE 
ENJOYED READING SHE WROTE POETRY 
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER SHE PAINTED 
SHE WAS LOVELY SHE WAS JUST KIND 
AND VERY CARING 
IT SEEMS QUITE 
EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS DAY AND AGE 
SHE WAS ATTACKED SPECIFICALLY 
BECAUSE OF THE WAY SHE WAS DRESSED 
YES YOU'D THINK THAT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE 
WOULD HAVE MOVED ON FROM THE 
INTOLERANCE THAT WAS SHOWN THAT 
NIGHT BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT KING STRIKING AS WELL WHAT THE JUDGE SAID HE 
SAID IT RAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THE SORT OF SOCIETY THAT 
EXISTS IN THIS COUNTRY WHAT DO YOU 
THINK HE MEANT BY THAT WELL WELL OBVIOUSLY HE'S TALKING ABOUT 
INTOLERANCE AND HATRED THAT CERTAIN 
SECTIONS OF SOCIETY HAVE FOR OTHERS 
AND THE TOTAL LACK OF RESPECT AND 
TOLERANCE THAT WAS SHOWN AND THAT 
IS SHOWN THROUGHOUT SOCIETY 
I KNOW THE IRONY OF IT ALL IS THAT 
YOU ARE A YOUTH WORKER AREN'T YOU 
IS IT CHANGING THE WAY YOU THINK 
ABOUT YOUR WORK AS WELL YES YES OBVIOUSLY IT HAS DONE YOU THINK 
ABOUT IT DEEPLY AND AT ONE STAGE ONE 
HAD THOUGHT I WOULDN'T GO BACK TO 
WORK BUT I FEEL THAT I SHOULD DO 
BECAUSE I CAN USE IN A DIFFERENT 
WAY THE THINGS I'VE LEARNT OVER 
THE LAST NINE MONTHS 
SUZANNE YOU 
WERE SOPHIE'S BEST FRIEND DOES IT 
WORRY YOU TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT 
HAPPENED TO SOPHIE THE WAY YOU'RE 
DRESSED THAT IT COULD HAPPEN TO 
YOU JIEFPLT IT DOES WORRY ME I 
TEND TO GO OUT WITH MY BOYFRIEND OR 
IN GROUPS L. WOULDN'T WANT TO 
CHANGE MY APPEARANCE JUST BECAUSE 
OF WHAT HAPPENED L. L. WOULD PREFER TO 
STAND UP FOR WHAT SOPHIE STOOD FOR 
WHY DID YOU TAKE ON THE IMAGE OF A 
GOTH 
THERE WASN'T AND REALLY A GOTH REASON SOPHIE AND MYSELF GOT INTO 
IT AT A YOUNG AGE MY MUM WAS IN 
THE GOTH SCENE SO WE GOT THE MUSIC 
SIDE FROM MY MUM AND WE DECIDE 
TODAY WEAR WHAT WE WANT 
IT'S JUST 
AIN CREDIBLE STORY SUCH A POWERFUL 
STORE STORY YOU CHOOSE TO DRESS 
LIKE THAT IT DRAWS ATTENTION TO 
YOURSELF 
NOT ALWAYS GOOD BUT YOURSELF BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT ATTENTION BAD 
ATTENTION IF YOU JUST DRESSED MORE 
NORMALLY YOU'D BE FINE 
NOT LIKE 
MANY LIKE MANY PEOPLE I HAVE 
BEEN SUBJECT TO ASSAULT PEOPLE 
HAVE ASKED WHY NOT TONE IT DOWN A 
BIT PEOPLE WHO SAY WE SHOULD STOP 
LOOKING DIFFERENT AND FIT IN IT IS 
LIKE WOMEN SHOULDN'T WEAR SHORT 
SKIRTS BECAUSE THEY WON'T GET RAPED 
IT IS A MORE RISK PARALLEL BUT IT 
IS TRUE 
WHAT STIMULATES PEOPLE TO 
SAY THEY'RE TOO DIFFERENT FOR MY 
LIKING SO I WILL ATTACK THEM 
PEOPLE FEAR THE UNKNOWN THEY HAVE 
THE IDEA THAT GOTHS OR PEOPLE HANG 
AROUND OR DRESS IN THE SAME WAY 
ARE SAT TANNIC BABY EATERS OR GO 
AROUND IN PACKS OF TEN OR ZERO BUT 
PERSONALLY I AM A CHRISTIAN I HELP 
OUT AT THE CHURCH YOU'VE JUST SEEN 
AND IT DISMAYS ME PEOPLE WON'T 
LOOK OUTSIDE WHAT THEIR NARROW VIEW 
POINTS ARE AND SEE WE'RE PEOPLE 
AND USUALLY KIND HEARTED PEOPLE 
YOU'RE PART OF THE CAMPAIGN IN 
SOPHIE'S NAME AND YOU HAVE A 
WEBSITE IT IS NOT JUST GOTHS IS IT 
THAT ARE TARGETED FOR THE WAY THEY 
LOOK WHAT ARE THE STORIES YOU HAVE 
BEEN TOLD 
THE CAMPAIGN'S CAUSED 
PREJUDICE EVERYWHERE IT IS AIMED 
AT SUBCULTURES REALLY SO WE'VE HAD 
A LOT OF PEOPLE COME TO THE WEBSITE 
SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND HITS AND WE HAVE SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED 
MEMBERS FRIENDS ON OUR SITE NOW 
AND A GREAT MAJORITY OF THOSE 
REPORT INCIDENTS WHAT HAVE HAPPENED 
IT MAY BE BECAUSE THEY'RE INTO 
METTLE MUSIC OR THEY'RE A PUNK AND 
WITHIN THE GOTH COMMUNITIES THERE 
ARE DIFFERENT SORTS IT IS NOT JUST 
ONE SORT OF PERSON WE NEED TO MAKE 
SURE THAT HATRED INTOLERANCE IS 
STAMPED OUT WITHIN SUBCULTURES 
SOME VICTIMS ARE AS YOUNG AS TWELVE 
YEAR OLD WHICH IS IN A BLACK 
SKINNY GENES AND HOODY WENT 
SHOPPING FOR HER MUM'S BIRTHDAY 
PRESENT WAS CHASED FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
AND MADE TO PLEAD FOR FORGIVENESS 
FOR BEING A GOTH 
WE ARE AT A STATE 
THAT YOU DRESS AND LOOK DIFFERENT 
AND YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF IN 
DANGER DEFINITELY 
WHAT CAN BE DANGER DEFINITELY DONE 
WE'RE HOPING THAT PART OF THE DONE FOUNDATION WE'RE GOING TO SET UP 
SOME TRAINING ET CETERA AND WHICH 
ARE HOPING TO GO INTO YOUTH CLUBS 
AND SCHOOLS AND DO GROUP WORK AND 
RAISE AWARENESS OF DIFFERENCES 
HOPEFULLY WE CAN BRING AN END TO 
SOME INTOLERANCE AND HOPEFULLY GO 
INTO PRIMARY SCHOOLS AS WELL AND 
START AT A YOUNGER AGE

THE FIRST QUESTION I GOT TO ASK YOU 
IS HOW DID YOU GET TOGETHER 
IT WAS 
ACTUALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
SCEPTICAL ABOUT THIS WAY OF FORMING 
A BAND WE AUDITIONED FOR T. OUR 
MANAGER WENT ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY 
AND TALKED TO UNIVERSITY RECORDS 
AND SAID THEY WANTED TO PUT 
TOGETHER A GROUP OF GIRLS WITH 
CLASSICAL MUSIC HE WENT AROUND 
LOOKING FOR GIRLS OUR AGE AND THEN 
I GUESS WE ALL GOT ONE OF THE 
PLACES SO IT WAS REALLY LUCKY FOR 
US IT IS KIND OF BEING IN THE 
RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME BUT 
QUITE GOOD AT SINGING 
DO YOU ALL GET ON WELL WITH EACH 
OTHER 
YEAH WAITING FOR A OTHER SARCASTIC REPLY 
NOW WE KNOW EACH 
OTHER WELL ENOUGH I CAN BE HONEST 
WE GET ON REALLY WELL 
THAT IS A 
GOOD SIGN BUT CLASSICAL CROSSOVER 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
IT IS A 
MIXTURE OF CLASSICAL AND 
CONTEMPORARY MUSIC WE ARE QUITE 
YOUNG TO BE SINGING CLASSICAL MUSIC 
SO WE ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE 
VERSATILE SO WE CAN SING A LOT OF 
STUFF IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
ALL RIGHT 
WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU NOW 
BOY I SEE 
BUT THEY ONLY REMIND ME OF YOU 
I WENT TO THE DOCTOR GUESS WHAT

DO DO BUT HE IS A FALL 
COST NOTHING COMPARES 
NOTHING COMPARES TWO U. 
NOTHING COMPARES 
NOTHING COMPARES TWO U. 
I WILL BE HONEST I WASN'T 
EXPECTING THAT RECORD TO BE SUNK IN 
THE CATHEDRAL 
MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT 
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE A CATHEDRAL 
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS THE 
ARCHITECTURE IS FANTASTIC ONE OF 
THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS WHEN YOU WALK 
IN HIS THERE IS SUCH A SILENCE 
WHEN I WALK INTO A CATHEDRAL FOR 
US IT IS THE LEVEL OF US ALL 
HAVING A BIG SPIRITUAL IMPACT IN 
THAT SENSE IT IS REALLY PEACEFUL 
THAT IS WHAT WE WANTED TO GET 
ACROSS IF WE PERFORM IN THE 
CATHEDRAL AS OPPOSED TO A NORMAL 
CONCERT HALL

EVENT FOR YOU ALL TELL ME WHAT IT 
IS

HAIR 
SHE WILL NOT HAIR YES NO CHANCE OF THAT IT WOULD BE 
CROWDED IF ALL ANGELS WERE SINGING 
IN CHURCH BUT ATTENDANCES FOR 
FORMAL RELIGIOUS SERVICES ARE 
FALLING MANY PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO 
THE INTERNET FOR THEIR SPIRITUAL 
NEEDS AND STUB IN THE HEART OF THE 
PIPE DERBYSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE AN 
UNUSUAL GATHERING IS HAPPENING 
FORTY EIGHT PEOPLE MEET UP FOR THE WEEKEND 
SOME HAD TRAVELLED FROM THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE WORLD THEY HAVE NEVER 
MET BEFORE AND YET THEY KNOW EACH 
OTHER REALLY WELL 
ALL THE WAY IT 
ON THE MOTORWAY I WAS THINKING I 
HAVE TO GO AND MEET FORTY EIGHT PEOPLE I 
HAVE NEVER MET L. WAS TERRIFIED 
THESE PEOPLE PRAY AND WORSHIP 
THROUGH THEIR COMPUTERS THEY ARE 
MEMBERS OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST ONLINE 
CHURCH SAINT PIXEL'S THE ONLY 
RECOGNISED EACH OTHER FROM THEIR 
ONLINE CARTOON CHARACTERS 
I TRIED 
TO CHOOSE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE ME 
SOME PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT THEY 
WANT TO CHOOSE ONE THAT MAY BE 
LOOKS LIKE WHAT THEY WISH THEY LOOK 
LIKE 
THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE I DO I LIKE I NEVER GO ROUND IN A RED TOP AND RED 
BEADS FROM THE CHOICES THAT IS 
THE ONLY THING I MIGHT WEAR THE THE CHURCH WAS ESTABLISHED FOUR YEARS 
AGO AND REVERENT PAM SMITH IS ONE 
OF THE LEADERS A REFERENCE IT IT IS THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO DECIDED 
THEY SHOULD BE A CHURCH ON THE 
INTERNET BECAUSE PEOPLE MIGHT COME 
LOOKING FOR ONE IT HAS BITS OF 
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING 
IN SAINT PIXEL'S AT THE MOMENT 
IMAGINE A CHURCH WITH NO COBWEBS 
WOODEN PEWS LEAKING ROOF ORGAN 
FUND OR CHURCH BUILDING THAT IS 
WHERE YOU ARE 
ANYONE CAN LOOK AT 
THE SAINT PIXEL'S SITE TO GET 
INVOLVED YOU HAVE TO CREATE AN 
ONLINE CHARACTER KNOWN AS AN AVATAR 
WELCOME TO THE SAINT PIXEL'S SANCTUARY 
THE SPACE FOR PRAYER AND WORSHIP 
THE BAR IS WHERE PEOPLE TEND TO GO 
IF THEY HAVE BEEN TO WORSHIP AND 
THEY WANT TO CHAT AFTERWARDS WHEN 
YOU MEET SOMEBODY THAT YOU HAVEN'T 
MET BEFORE IN REAL LIFE AND I HAVE 
DONE THIS LOT OF TIMES ONE PERSON 
I KNEW VERY WELL ONLINE L. WAS E. 
MAILING HER ABOUT THINGS AND WE 
WERE SHARING AT QUITE A DEEP LEVEL 
BUT WE HAD NEVER MET IN REAL LIFE 
THE FIRST THING IF YOU HAVEN'T 
SEEN A PHOTO IS OH GOSH YOU 
DON'T LOOK LIKE I EXPECTED WITHIN 
A FEW MINUTES YOU ARE AT THE LEVEL 
OF INTERACTING WITH THE PERSON 
THAT REMARKABLY USUALLY COMES 
ACROSS REALLY WELL ON LINE 
NICE TO SEE YOU 
ONE OF THE LEADERS CHERONO HAS 
COME ACROSS FROM THE STATES FOR THE 
WEEKEND SHE AND PAM HAD BEEN 
WORKING TOGETHER FOR FOUR YEARS BUT 
HAD NEVER MET IN PERSON HAVE 
BEEN 
YOU ARE HERE BEEN PEOPLE DO COME ACROSS VERY MUCH AS 
THEMSELVES A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK 
PEOPLE DECEIVE PEOPLE ON THE 
INTERNET IDENTITIES AND THINGS 
YOU CAN'T REALLY CUT UP YOUR 
PERSONALITY FOR LONG EVEN IF YOU 
ARE TRYING COVER UP PEOPLE 
SHARE THROUGH THEIR BLOGS WE KNOW 
A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES ALL 
THAT IS WHAT MAKES UP THE PERSON 
THE APPEARANCE IS JUST A SMALL 
AMOUNT AMOUNT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU 
OH THANK YOU 
THAT HIS GREAT 
I LOVE WHAT I HAVE FOUND IN TERMS 
OF COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE ONE OF THE 
THINGS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING LIKE 
ABOUT HIS WILL WE BE LIKE THE 
CHARACTERS WE HAVE GOT TO KNOW 
DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE THINKS ABOUT ME 
I THINK SO L. L. HADN'T BEEN WELL 
SOMETHING WITH MY HEART L. WAS TOLD 
TO STAY QUIET AND NOT TOO MUCH L. 
JOINED SAINT PIXEL'S AND REALLY 
ENJOYED THE COMMUNITY AND 
ESPECIALLY THE ABILITY TO WORSHIP 
I LIVE ALONE SO THERE WAS SOMEBODY 
ELSE TO CHAT WITH AND JUST PASS THE 
DAY 
I WANTED TO CHAT ON THE DAY INTERNET I THOUGHT HANG ON A 
SECOND THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING FOR 
CHATTING BUT HOW CAN YOU WORSHIP IN 
FRONT OF A COMPUTER PART OF WHAT 
WAS INTRIGUING IS IS IT POSSIBLE 
TO DO CHURCH ON THE COMPUTER 
ACTUALLY IT WORKED BRILLIANTLY 
WHEN I TRY AND TELL MY OWN CHURCH 
ABOUT THIS THEY THINK I AM MAD A 
COUPLE ARE INTERESTED IN TRYING IT 
BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN YOU FIRST TRY 
AND TELL THEM THEY GO HANG ON IT 
IS A BIT BARKING 
EVERY NIGHT ON SAINT 
PIXEL'S THERE IS A SERVICE WITH 
HYMNS PRAYERS AND THE TOP 
NORMALLY PEOPLE WOULD BE TAKING 
PART AT HOME BUT TONIGHT FOR ONE 
NIGHT ONLY THEY ARE ALL IN THE 
SAME PLACE HYMNS PRAYERS AND A 
TALK 
TO REMEMBER HIS PROMISE OF MERCY 
THEY TAKE IT IN TURNS TO PREPARE 
AND LEAD THE SERVICE AND EVERYONE 
TYPES THEIR RESPONSE IS ONLINE 
RESPONSES BUT THEY HAVE TO BE 
PRETTY QUICK TO KEEP UP 
I HAD HAD 
FAITH IN THE PAST BUT THROUGH 
VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES MY FAITH HAD 
DESERTED ME L. LACKED SELF 
CONFIDENCE BECAUSE IT WAS NON 
THREATENING NOBODY COULD SEE ME 
AND THEREFORE I COULD BE HONEST AND 
I COULD SAY WHAT I WANTED TO SAY 
WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF PEOPLE'S 
ANSWERS AND GRADUALLY MY 
CONFIDENCE HAS GROWN TO TALK ABOUT 
VERY DEEP AND VERY SPIRITUAL AND 
VERY DIFFICULT THINGS 
THE ONE THING THE GROUP CAN'T DO 
ONLINE IS TAKE COMMUNION AND THAT 
IS ALL WITH THE CENTREPIECE OF THE 
WEEK AWAY ALWAYS THE CENTREPIECE 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS 
ABOUT AN ONLINE CHURCH IS THE IDEA 
THAT WHEN YOU ARE ONLINE YOU ARE 
SOME WAY IN SOME WAY ANONYMOUS 
BECAUSE YOU ARE ANONYMOUS YOU CAN 
BE MUCH MORE HONEST ABOUT WHAT YOU 
ARE REALLY THINKING AND GOING 
THROUGH IN YOUR LIFE 
I THINK FOR LOT OF PEOPLE IT IS 
NOT NECESSARILY THEY ARE MAD ABOUT 
THE INTERNET BUT IT ALLOWS THEM TO 
DO IT WITH PEOPLE THEY WOULDN'T BE 
ABLE TO OTHERWISE IT IS A TOOL FOR 
COMMUNITY 
GETTING TOGETHER COMMUNITY PHYSICALLY IT IS SOMETHING VERY 
SPECIAL BECAUSE AS YOU GET TO KNOW 
PEOPLE ONLINE VERY YOU WANT TO 
THIS IS 
A 
TO DEEPEN 
THE 
IS 
WHY I DON'T BUY INTO THE 
THERE 
IS 
VIRTUAL 
ITLE TEST 
A REAL WORLD 
OF OUR LIVES AND JUST WAYS WE MIGHT 
MEET PEOPLE 
TO TALK ABOUT THAT VIRTUAL AND REAL 
WORLD WE ARE JOINED BY MATT AITKEN 
INVOLVED IN THE LAUNCH OF A NEW 
RELIGIOUS SITE ON THE INTERNET YOU 
HAVE DONE RESEARCH INTO WORSHIPPING 
ONLINE IS IT THE GROWING TREND 
YES THE ONLINE MOVEMENT IS A 
GROWING TREND ACROSS THE WORLD OF 
ONLINE USERS YOU HAVE THE GROWTH 
OF YOUTUBE AND FACEBOOK MACRO AND 
ALL THESE DIFFERENT NETWORKS THE 
PEOPLE OF THE CHURCH ARE RIGHT 
THERE GETTING INVOLVED 
WHAT WAS 
INTERESTING ABOUT THAT FILM IS 
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN 
WORSHIPPING ON WINE WHEN THEY GET 
TOGETHER IT IS VERY TRADITIONAL 
WORSHIPPING ONLINE 
I HAVE NOT BEEN 
TWISTED PIXELS SEVERS MYSELF THE 
INTERNET IS SO BIG AND FULL OF ALL 
KIND OF PEOPLE SAINT PIXEL'S 
SERVICE 
IT IS NOT JUST THE CHURCH SERVICE THERE ARE OTHER ONLINE SITES FOR 
OTHER RELIGIONS AS WELL 
IN TERMS 
OF A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE GETTING 
TOGETHER ONLINE THEY ARE ALL SORTS 
OF THINGS THERE ARE MUSLIMS 
ISLAMIC AND SIKHISM CHRISTIANITY 
BUT NOT JUST RELIGION AS WELL 
THERE ARE GOLF COMMUNITIES AND 
TATTOOING COMMUNITIES AND ALL 
THINGS IT IS A BIG CRAZE 
IS THERE 
A DANGER IF YOU ARE WORSHIPPING 
ONLINE OR OF BEING DRAWN INTO 
SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS IS NOT WHAT 
IT PURPORTS TO BE THAT IS NOT THE 
CHURCH THAT YOU EXPECT IT TO BE 
THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK OF PEOPLE 
MOSQUE READING BUT SUPPORT IT 
WAS INTERESTING IN THAT CLIP THERE 
BUT ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW PEOPLE IT 
IS HARD TO HIDE YOUR PERSONALITY 
THERE IS ALWAYS THE DANGER OF 
GIVING OUT YOUR CONTACT DETAILS 
BUT THERE IS LOT OF VALUABLE 
COMMUNITY AS WELL 
IS THERE A 
DANGER IF PEOPLE ARE WORSHIPPING 
ONLINE AND USING RELIGIOUS SITE 
THAT IT HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON 
PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH ON A SUNDAY 
POSSIBLY TO SOME EXTENT BUT IT IS 
MORE SUPPLEMENTARY IT IS THE 
ABILITY TO GO ALONG AND BE AT 
CHURCH AND THEN COME AWAY BUT STILL 
IN YOUR OWN HOME BE IN CONTACT WITH 
PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY IN YOUR 
STREET EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IN 
YOUR CHURCH THAT IS A GOOD THING 
AND DOESN'T NECESSARILY TAKE AWAY 
FROM THE CHURCH
