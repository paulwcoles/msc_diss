SO WHAT CHOPPED OFF THE HEAD AND THE HANDS I'D PUT MY MONEY ON A SWORD 
ARGH AND A BIG ONE 
BUT YOU WERE A HERO YOU SAVED SOME MEN'S LIVES AFTER THEY WERE HIT BY A ROADSIDE BOMB 
WAS FRANCIS DUGGAN ONE OF THESE MEN THAT YOU SAVED YES 
MY SON WAS KILLED WHILST SERVING HIS COUNTRY 
LOMAX 
I'VE NOT SEEN MARK FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS YOU'VE HAD NO CONTACT WITH HIM SINCE NO 
THIS WOMAN YOU SAW WITH MARK HAD YOU EVER SEEN HER BEFORE 
YOU'RE SWANNING AROUND WITH SOME SLAG 
NO NEVER I THINK SHE WAS FOREIGN OR SOMETHING SHE LOOKED ARAB 
I CAN'T FIND MARK AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I TRUST 
I CAN'T HELP YOU I'VE GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW SHAHLA 
FRANCIS I'VE GOT LEUKAEMIA 
YOU'VE NO IDEA WHERE HE COULD BE I TOLD YOU I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM 
WE ARE GONNA FIND HIM BEFORE SHAHLA OR THE POLICE DO 
I TOOK YOUNG SOLDIERS OUT TO IRAQ AND WAS THEN TOLD TO MAKE THEM ACT AS POLICEMEN 
THE FACE OF EVERY YOUNG BOY I LOST IS BURNT INTO MY MEMORY SO NO NO SOLDIER'S DEATH IS ACCEPTABLE TO ME 
THE DEAD BODY IS MARK BENNET SO WE HAVE OUR VICTIM 
DUGGAN WENT MISSING ABOUT THE TIME BENNET DISAPPEARED 
SO DUGGAN COULD BE ANOTHER VICTIM OR THE KILLER 
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY YOU NEED IT THE POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU 
EVERYONE'S SHITTING THEMSELVES LOOK HERE 
FRANCIS DUGGAN 
DOWN BOYD DOWN 
YES I WAS COUNTING ON YOUR SUPPORT BRIGADIER 
WHY SHOULD WE SUBJECTED TO ENDLESS QUE 
OF COURSE 
SO YOU WERE CLOSE AT ONE TIME 
WE WERE REALLY CLOSE AS KIDS 
WE LOST TOUCH WHEN MY DAD KICKED HIM OUT 
YOU'VE HAD NO CONTACT SINCE I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FIND HIM 
HE FOUND ME 
HE JUST TURNED UP OUT OF THE BLUE 
WHY FRAN 
I'M SORRY WE DON'T KNOW YET 
WHY WERE YOU LOOKING FOR HIM 
DID FRANCIS TALK TO YOU AT ALL ABOUT HIS TIME IN IRAQ 
TWO YEARS AGO ONE OF HIS CLOSE COLLEAGUES MARK BENNET 
HE WAS MURDERED 
AND AT THE SAME TIME FRANCIS WENT ON THE RUN NOW WE NEED TO SEE IF THE TWO THINGS ARE CONNECTED 
YOU THINK FRAN KILLED HIM WE DON'T KNOW YET 
BUT WHAT WE DO NEED TO KNOW IS ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN GIVE US ABOUT FRAN'S TIME IN IRAQ 
FRANCIS WAS SCARED 
I TRIED TO GET HIM TO TELL ME WHY 
BUT HE JUST SAID SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED AND 
HE HAD TO GO AWAY BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO GET HURT 
THAT'S ALL HE SAID 
O. K. 
IT MUST'VE BEEN QUITE A PARTY SOMEONE GETS BEHEADED 
THEN SOMEONE DISAPPEARS AND THE DAY THEY COME BACK THEY GET KILLED 
I DIDN'T MURDER BENNET OR DUGGAN SO WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED 
YOU HIT THE PORT AND THE CHARADES GOT OUT OF HAND DON'T BE ABSURD 
I'M ABSURD THE WAY YOU GUYS DRESS UP TRADITION HISTORY 
LOOKING LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE NUTCRACKER 
YOU KNOW SUPERINTENDENT SOMEONE LIKE YOU WILL ALWAYS STRUGGLE 
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO SERVE WITHOUT QUESTION TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING GREATER THAN ONESELF 
SOMETHING GREATER THAN ONESELF 
WHAT A WONDERFUL ABDICATION OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
THERE YOU SEE THAT'S NOT WHAT IT MEANS 
WELL YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT DINNER IN YOUR OWN WORDS 
GOOD BENNET SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE BEEN THERE HE'D LEFT THE REGIMENT MONTHS EARLIER 
WAS THIS BEFORE OR AFTER YOU ASSUMED COMMAND A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER WERE THESE TWO EVENTS RELATED 
I HAD WARNED HIM ABOUT HIS DRINKING BUT THE DECISION TO LEAVE WAS HIS 
WAS HE DRUNK THAT NIGHT CORPORAL LOMAX WHAT'S GOING ON 
SIR I JUST HAD TO SEE BENNET WHAT THE HELL'S HE DOING HERE GET HIM OFF THE BASE NOW SIR 
YOU STUCK UP BASTARD GET HIM OUT OF HERE HE'S A BLOODY DISGRACE 
I TOLD CORPORAL LOMAX TO ESCORT HIM FROM THE BARRACKS SO IT'S LOMAX I SHOULD BE SPEAKING TO 
I SUPPOSE SO YES A MAN YOU HATE 
NO THAT'S NOT TRUE A MAN WHO SAVED A DRUNK AND A WIMP FROM THE LAND ROVER AND LEFT YOUR SON TO DIE 
TWO LOSERS WHO DROPPED OUT OF THE ARMY SO WHEN BENNET TURNS UP DRUNK 
AT YOUR CEREMONIAL DINNER THAT MUST'VE BEEN TOO MUCH TO BEAR 
THE THOUGHT THAT YOUR SON HAD DIED SO THAT THIS TRAVESTY OF A SOLDIER COULD LIVE 
I'VE TOLD YOU WHAT HAPPENED 
NOW CHARGE ME OR LET ME GO 
I MAKE THE DECISIONS HERE COLONEL 
YOU DO WHAT I SAY ALL RIGHT 
YOU NEED TO LOOK AT ALL THE POSSIBLE DANGER POINTS IN THE ROOM 
WHERE COULD YOU GET HIT FROM 
IF YOU GET HIT WHAT'S THE ROUTE THAT YOU PLAN TO EVACUATE THE PRINCIPAL 
BANG 
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WALKS INTO THE ROOM YOU GET DISTRACTED YOU JUST LOST YOUR MAN 
REMEMBER THE PRINCIPAL IS THE MONEY NEVER LOSE THE MONEY 
TAKE A FIVE MINUTE BREAK AND THEN WE'LL RUN IT AGAIN 
YOU COULDN'T HAVE TIMED THAT BETTER WASN'T THAT CHEATING MAYBE 
TELL YOU WHAT EVEN I MIGHT'VE FOUND MYSELF DISTRACTED 
I'D BE WONDERING WHO YOU WERE AND IF YOU WERE SINGLE WHAT YOU WERE DOING TONIGHT 
HYPOTHETICALLY OF COURSE 
DETECTIVE CONSTABLE GOODMAN SINGLE AND PROBABLY WORKING UNTIL MIDNIGHT 
NOW I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING 
SURE I'D LIKE YOU TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH 
WHY TO TAKE A D. N. A. SWAB 
WE NEED TO ELIMINATE YOU FROM OUR INQUIRY 
WHAT INQUIRY 
FRANCIS DUGGAN WAS KILLED YESTERDAY 
FRAN DUGGAN'S DEAD BOTH MARK BENNET AND FRANCIS DUGGAN SERVED WITH YOU IN IRAQ 
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE WHO MIGHT HAVE WANTED THEM DEAD I DON'T KNOW 
I MEAN I HAVEN'T SEEN EITHER OF THEM SINCE I LEFT THE REGIMENT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
SO WHERE WERE YOU YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 
I WAS AT TILBURY CONTAINER TERMINAL TAKING POSSESSION OF TEN ARMOURED LAND CRUISERS 
THE KIND OF STUFF THAT WE SHOULD'VE HAD IN IRAQ 
YOU KNOW THOSE LADS SURVIVED A BOMB AND ALL THE INSANITY OF IRAQ 
NOW MARK AND FRAN ARE DEAD 
IT'S O. K. SIT DOWN 
SIT 
ALL RIGHT SO IRAQ 
BASIC STUFF 
RUNNING MESSAGES FROM BASE TO THE REST OF THE REGIMENT LIAISING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADERS 
WHY WERE YOU FOLLOWING INSURGENTS WHEN YOU WERE AMBUSHED 
LIEUTENANT MALHAM SAW A PICK UP WITH A TARPAULIN OVER THE BACK THOUGHT IT WAS CARRYING GUNS 
BUT IT WAS A SET UP TO LURE US DOWN THE TRACK WHERE THE BOMB WAS HIDDEN 
WHICH IS WHAT YOU SUSPECTED ALL ALONG 
I VOICED MY CONCERNS YES 
SO WHEN THE BOMB EXPLODED IT MUST'VE FELT LIKE THE WORST CASE OF I TOLD YOU SO IN HISTORY 
DID JAMES MALHAM MAKE A BAD CALL YES HE DID DID I BLAME HIM NO 
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS IN THE GUARDS OR ANY REGIMENT 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BEST OF THE BEST THE HARDCORE CREW 
IRAQ HERE WE COME 
DID YOU KNOW FRANCIS DUGGAN WAS MURDERED 
WHAT HE WAS SHOT BY A HIGH POWERED RIFLE FROM MORE THAN FIFTY YARDS 
HE KNEW HE WAS IN DANGER WHEN HE WENT ON THE RUN TWO YEARS AGO AND YET HE CAME BACK INTO THE AREA 
AREN'T YOU CURIOUS TO KNOW WHY HE CAME BACK OR PERHAPS YOU KNOW ALREADY 
WHY DID HE COME BACK BECAUSE HE'D TRACKED DOWN HIS SISTER WHO'S DYING IN A HOSPICE 
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HER NO OR YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TELL US SO WE WOULDN'T FIND HIM BEFORE YOU DID 
FRAN HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FROM ME 
THEN WHO I MEAN WHO WHO WAS HE SO TERRIFIED OF 
THAT HE TELLS HIS DYING SISTER THAT HE'LL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN 
AND WHY DID DUGGAN GO A. W. O. L. IN THE FIRST PLACE 
DID HE NOT FANCY BEING BEHEADED LIKE BENNET RIGHT 
AND WHO KILLED BENNET WHO OR WHAT IS WORTH MORE THAN THE LIVES OF TWO SOLDIERS 
I'M SORRY I CAN'T HELP YOU 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE LEFT THEM TO DIE IN THE LAND ROVER MIGHTN'T YOU 
SPENCE SAW A LONE DRIVER BUT THE SNIPER COULD HAVE BEEN HIDING IN THE BACK OR EVEN THE BOOT 
UNLESS SNIPER AND DRIVER WERE ONE AND THE SAME 
IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE IF THEY WERE WHY 
LOOK I'M A SNIPER AND I WANT TO TAKE UP AS MUCH ROOM AS I POSSIBLY CAN IN THE BACK OF THE CAR 
TO LINE UP MY SHOT BUT IF I'M ALSO THE GETAWAY DRIVER I'D WANT TO TAKE MY SHOT 
AND THEN MAKE MY ESCAPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
PRECISELY NOW LOOK AT THE WINDSCREEN 
OH YEAH LOOK AT THIS CRACK 
NOW TWO BULLETS WERE FOUND AT THE SCENE CONSISTENT WITH FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX RIFLE ROUNDS 
IF A RIFLE WERE TO EJECT CASINGS 
AT HIGH SPEED TO THE RIGHT THEY MIGHT CAUSE CRACKS LIKE THAT 
SO WHERE ARE THE CASINGS I DON'T KNOW 
EVERYONE'S HAPPY 
NOT MUCH ATTACKS NOW 
PEOPLE GET PETROL FOR THEIR CARS MEDICINE FOR THEIR CHILDREN 
IT'S A GOOD JOB YOU ARE DOING 
I'VE JUST SCOURED THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF TAPES FROM THE PRECINCT CAMERA AND I CAN'T FIND IT 
O. K. SO BROADEN YOUR SEARCH THEN OR SHE MIGHT HAVE FOUND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GO SHOPPING 
START LOOKING IN THE SURROUNDING STREETS WHAT ABOUT ANDY TYRREL 
OH YES WHERE IS IT THE SECURITY GATE AT TILBURY CONTAINER TERMINAL 
CONFIRMS HIS CAR WAS THERE AT THE TIME OF DUGGAN'S MURDER 
YEAH BUT THAT'S TYRREL'S CAR NOT TYRREL 
YEAH AND SO CHECK THE C. C. T. V. 
SIR I'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO LOMAX'S FINANCES LAST MONTH THREE THOUSAND WAS DEPOSITED INTO HIS ACCOUNT 
IT'S HIS LOYALTY PAYMENT FOR SIGNING ON FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS RIGHT 
YEAH BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING WAS HE IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED IT TO ANOTHER ACCOUNT NICOLA BENNET'S 
NICOLA BENNET'S YEAH 
BUT SHE TOLD ME SHE'D HAD NO CONTACT WITH ANY OF THESE BOYS SINCE MARK LEFT THE ARMY

TWO OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE ALREADY DEAD 
I'M CONCERNED FOR YOUR SAFETY 
HE'S GOT A GIFT OF WHAT 
O. K. 
GOOD MAN 
GOOD MAN 
CORPORAL LOMAX HAS A GREAT SENSE OF LOYALTY 
OH GOOD I'M PLEASED SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT HE'S HIDING 
HE FEELS COMPELLED TO PROTECT THE REGIMENT ONLY 
COURSE HE DOES 
WE WERE PREPARING FOR THE REGIMENTAL DINNER AND I WAS CALLED TO THE GATE MARK WAS THERE MARK BENNET 
YES HE WAS DRUNK SAYING I'D SLEPT WITH NICOLA 
MUST'VE BEEN TRICKY 
OH YES IT WAS BUT I MANAGED TO CONVINCE HIM IT WASN'T TRUE 
AND YOU LET HIM IN TO THE BARRACKS IT'S NEVER GONNA BE ALL RIGHT ENOUGH JUST LEAVE IT 
CORPORAL LOMAX WHAT'S GOING ON 
SIR I JUST HAD TO SEE BENNET WHAT THE HELL'S HE DOING HERE GET HIM OFF THE BASE NOW SIR 
YOU STUCK UP BASTARD GET HIM OUT OF HERE 
I THOUGHT I'D STICK HIM IN MY ROOM TO CALM DOWN 
THE LAST TIME I SAW MARK HE WAS HEADING OUT OF THE BARRACKS 
AND WHAT ABOUT COLONEL MALHAM 
I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN THAT NIGHT 
BUT THE NEXT DAY HE ASKED ME TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT IT 
ABOUT BENNET GETTING HIS HEAD CHOPPED OFF ABOUT THE ROW 
IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE REGIMENT OF COURSE 
WELL I HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH FUN IN A CAR SINCE I WAS SIXTEEN 
THERE YOU GO THANKS 
O. K. H. M. M. RIGHT 
WHAT HAPPENED WELL HE SAID THAT BENNET WAS GIVING MALHAM GRIEF AND PEOPLE DID SEE THAT 
DO YOU KNOW JOHN GARRET HELLO PLEASED TO MEET YOU 
YES DOCTOR FOLEY 
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF COLONEL MALHAM 
WELL THE DECISION TO MAKE MALHAM COMMANDER OF CEREMONIAL DUTIES 
MEANT HE WAS NO LONGER AN ACTIVE SOLDIER 
SO HE WAS PROMOTED OUT OF HARM'S WAY 
YEAH BUT THE DEATH OF HIS SON HIT HIM VERY HARD 
IF HE'D ASKED FOR A DIFFERENT POSTING WOULD HE HAVE BEEN DENIED 
NO IN FACT HE WAS OFFERED SOMETHING ELSE FIRST 
SO HE CHOSE TO WORK WITH A MAN HE DESPISED WHO LEFT HIS SON TO DIE WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS 
WELL HE'S PUT HIMSELF IN A POSITION WHERE HE'S FEEDING OFF HIS ANGER AND HIS GRIEF AND IT'S INTERESTING 
THANKS 
THANKS 
DAD 
I APPRECIATE THE CALL THANK YOU 
YOUR SON GOT HIMSELF KILLED TRYING TO PROVE HIMSELF TO YOU AND NEARLY TOOK US ALL WITH HIM 
LOMAX 
THE GATE LOG SAYS MALHAM LEFT THE BARRACKS AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
HE COULD'VE MADE IT TO THE HOSPICE IN TIME TO BE OUR KILLER 
EVEN IF HE KILLED MARK BENNET THERE IS NO WAY HE KILLED DUGGAN 
WHY NOT I MEAN WHAT'S HIS MOTIVE FOR A START 
MOTIVE LET'S SEE MURDER TO CONCEAL MURDER 
WE'VE SEEN THAT OFTEN ENOUGH THIS IS A MAN CONSUMED BY GRIEF 
HE'S IN AGONY IF HE WANTED TO KILL SOMEONE HE'D JUST WALK STRAIGHT UP TO THEM AND DO IT 
MAYBE HE WAS TURNING UP THE GRIEF FOR OUR BENEFIT 
NO HE'S NOT 
HOW DO YOU KNOW 
SO HE'S OVER IT BY NOW 
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT SPENCE 
ANYWAY MALHAM'S ASSISTANT MADE REFERENCE TO A CALL HE TOOK 
JUST BEFORE HE KILLED HIMSELF I KNOW WHO MADE THAT CALL 
SIR THE MOD ARE ASKING WHEN A REPORT ON COL MALHAM'S SUICIDE I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT 
THEY WANT NEXT WEEK GREAT 
HI 
THIS IS MALHAM'S SWORD 
IT WAS FOUND IN HIS PERSONAL LOCKER WELL THAT COULD BE INNOCENT ENOUGH 
YEAH I DID SOME CHEMICAL ETCHING TO LOOK AT THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE METAL SURFACE AND 
IT'S NOT THE MURDER WEAPON 
NO 
YOU DON'T SEEM SURPRISED OR DISAPPOINTED 
NO YOU'RE RIGHT I'M NOT 
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO BE GUILTY 
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT AM I 
I CALLED MALHAM TO LET HIM KNOW THAT YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY 
IT SEEMED THE DECENT THING TO DO FOR A FELLOW OFFICER IF I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT 
THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO THE HONOURABLE THING HONOUR AND PRIDE 
THEY'RE THINGS I DON'T ASSOCIATE WITH YOU 
WHEN YOUR REGIMENT WAS DEPLOYED TO NORTHERN BASRA STRAIGHT AWAY YOU GOT INTO TROUBLE DIDN'T YOU 
BASRA WAS A VOLATILE AREA 
I'LL SAY THE FIRST TWO MONTHS I'VE GOT PRESS CUTTINGS 
IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS SEVEN OF YOUR MEN WERE KILLED 
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW 
SEVEN MEN THAT IS DISASTROUS SO MUCH SO THAT THERE WAS A QUESTION MARK HANGING OVER YOUR COMMAND 
I WAS UNDER PRESSURE TO STABILISE THE SITUATION 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS FOR YOU A GUARDS OFFICER 
IF YOU WERE RELIEVED OF YOUR COMMAND BECAUSE YOU WERE INADEQUATE 
IT'S ON RECORD THAT WE DID A FANTASTIC JOB IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS IN THE AREA 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DID IT BECAUSE YOU'RE THE SAME MAN THE SAME COMMANDER 
BEGINNING YOU WERE CRAP 
THEN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS OF THE TOUR NOT ONE OF YOUR SOLDIERS WAS KILLED HOW DID THAT HAPPEN 
WELL IT TAKES TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL PEOPLE 
IF YOU'RE SO SUCCESSFUL WHY DO YOU RESIGN YOU'RE A HERO BUT YOU RESIGN YOUR COMMISSION 
YOU GO INTO THE WORLD OF MERCENARY SOLDIERING WHEN YOU COULD'VE BEEN A HERO IN THE GUARDS 
HONOUR PRIDE THE GUARDS I DON'T GET IT 
GARRET HAS CONTROL OVER EVERYBODY 
HE EVEN GETS MALHAM TO BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT DO THE HONOURABLE THING COS HE'S GONNA BE ARRESTED 
HE DOESN'T BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT BECAUSE HE'S GONNA BE ARRESTED 
BUT BECAUSE HE'S ADDLED WITH GRIEF OVER HIS SON 
BUT HE'S PUSHED TO IT EMOTIONALLY PUSHED 
GARRET WOULDN'T GET HIS HANDS DIRTY TALKING OF CONTROL JUST LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING 
THIS IS THE C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE OF OUR MYSTERIOUS WOMAN BEFORE THE WIFE ENTERS THE SCENE 
AND WHAT IS SHE SAYING TO HIM THAT PROVOKES HIM SO MUCH 
HE LOSES IT BUT NOT WITH HER HE SMACKS HIS WIFE 
STILL OUT OF CONTROL HE GOES TO THE BARRACKS AND MEETS THE GRIM REAPER 
SHE'S MIDDLE EASTERN WE'VE GOT IRAQ SO THERE'S A CONNECTION 
WE ASSUME THAT GARRET IS IN CONTROL OF ALL THIS 
NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THIS WOMAN AUTHORISES BENNET'S DEATH NO NO NO I'M NOT SAYING THAT 
BUT SHE CERTAINLY HAS A PART TO PLAY IN ALL THIS 
HELLO CAN I HELP I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN GARRET 
YOU MAKE SURE YOU BRING THAT CONTRACT BACK TO ME EXCUSE ME 
YOU ARE MARK BENNET'S FRIEND I REMEMBER YOU 
OH HI YEAH CAN YOU GIVE ME A SECOND GENTS

HE COMMANDED YOU IN IRAQ GAVE YOU A PLUM JOB AT A. P. X. SOLUTIONS BUT HE'S BEEN EXPLOITING YOU ALL ALONG 
WHATEVER 
THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU SMART ENOUGH TO SEE IT 
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME MY FRIEND 
GARRET WILL BETRAY YOU TO PROTECT HIMSELF 
THIS IS HOW YOU CRACK BANK ROBBERS INNIT TELL THEM THAT THE OTHER GUY'S GRASSED 
HE MADE ME A JOB OFFER 
MAYBE IT WAS TO REPLACE YOU

ONE OF MY OFFICERS IS IN THE NEXT ROOM WITH ANDY TYRREL 
ANDY TYRREL'S D. N. A. WAS FOUND ON THE SHELL THAT KILLED FRANCIS DUGGAN ANDY TYRREL WORKS FOR YOU 
I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO SAY ANYTHING DON'T WORRY 
TELL ME ABOUT BADAWI 
HE'S THE HEAD OF THE REGIONAL COUNCIL IN BASRA 
HE WAS ONE OF SADDAM'S TORTURERS WASN'T HE I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM WHEN I WAS WITH THE REGIMENT 
THIS IS MR. BADAWI HE'LL HELP US QUELL THE VIOLENCE IN THE AREA IN EXCHANGE FOR AID AND MEDICINE 
YOU NEVER MET BADAWI WHEN YOU WERE IN IRAQ 
NO I WORKED WITH PLENTY OF PEOPLE LIKE HIM WE ALL DID 
THE PRICE OF PEACE YOU DON'T KNOW THE CHALLENGES OF TRYING TO POLICE A WAR ZONE LET ALONE REBUILD IT 
YOU PUT BADAWI BACK IN POWER THOUGH 
WHO RAN GERMANY AFTER THE WAR THE SAME MEN HE GETS TO KILL WITH IMPUNITY 
YOU GET TO PRETEND YOU'RE STILL IN CHARGE 
IT WAS THE SAME MEN WHO'D BURNT DOWN JEWISH BUSINESSES 
DRAWING PARALLELS WITH THE NAZIS SAYS SOMETHING DOESN'T IT 
PEACE IS ALWAYS A MESS AND NOBODY WANTS TO STICK AROUND TO POLICE IT 
EXCEPT YOU IT WAS A JOB OPPORTUNITY A. P. X. SOLUTIONS 
THE PUBLIC WANT OUR TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ I FILL THE VACUUM 
PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS MAKING MONEY FOR YOU 
HAVE YOU NEVER MADE A DEAL WITH A CRIMINAL TO GET A BIGGER FISH AND THEN FELT QUEASY AFTERWARDS 
NOT WITH A MASS MURDERER NO 
NO YOU SWIM IN A SLIGHTLY SMALLER POND NOT TO MENTION A SAFER ONE 
IN BASRA I MADE MORE LIFE OR DEATH DECISIONS IN A WEEK THAN YOU WILL MAKE IN YOUR ENTIRE CAREER 
YOU MADE ONE VERY BAD DECISION YOU WERE LOSING SOLDIERS EVERY DAY SO YOU MADE A PACT WITH BADAWI 
AND HE GETS TO MAKE SURE NO ONE'S AROUND TO TESTIFY ABOUT HIS PAST 
I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU ISN'T THAT WHAT HAPPENED SIT DOWN 
SIT DOWN 
WELL THAT WAS A VERY INTERESTING APPROACH BOYD 
MANHANDLING A MAN WHO SPENT HIS LIFE LEARNING HOW TO KILL 
WHAT DID THAT ACHIEVE NOW WE GET TO HOLD HIM ON AN ASSAULT CHARGE I SACRIFICED MYSELF 
WELL DONE I'VE JUST COME FROM AN INTERVIEW WITH NICOLA BENNET 
SHE WAS PRETTY INCOHERENT SHE'D HAD A CONFRONTATION WITH LOMAX 
I THINK HE'S SUFFERING FROM SURVIVOR'S GUILT 
THAT WILL GIVE HIM A PROPENSITY TO SUICIDE THAT'S FANTASTIC WHAT 
IF HE'S UNRAVELLING BECAUSE OF SOME PERSONAL CRISIS THEN MAYBE THIS REGIMENTAL SILENCE STUFF 
WILL GO OUT OF THE WINDOW YEAH O. K. LET'S GO NO YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME 
I SAID A PROPENSITY TO SUICIDE RIGHT LET'S SEE 
WHY DOESN'T HE EVER LISTEN I DID 
I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING NOW THANK YOU THANKS 
BOYD HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW IRRESPONSIBLE YOU ARE BEING 
THIS MAN'S A TRAINED KILLER 
DON'T DESTROY HIS WORLD 
BOYD 
LOMAX 
ARE YOU INTENDING TO USE THAT AGAIN 
YES WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY WHEN YOU'VE KILLED ONCE 
I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE YOU KILLED THOSE WOMEN IN IRAQ 
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE 
AS GOOD AS YOU STOOD BY WITNESSED IT DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT SINCE HAVE YOU 
YOU DIDN'T HELP SHAHLA AHMED BRING THE KILLER TO JUSTICE 
BUT YOU CAN'T THINK FOR YOURSELF CAN YOU LOMAX 
THAT'S WHY YOU SIGNED UP FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS OF THIS MINDLESS CRAP 
YOU'RE SCARED SHITLESS 
YOU THINK SO YES I DO 
TELL ME WHEN YOU GUYS JOIN UP 
DO YOU SIGN AWAY YOUR CONSCIENCE 
IS THAT IT 
WOMEN HAVE DIED A CHILD HAS DIED 
YOUR BEST FRIEND BENNET HE DIED AND WHAT DO YOU DO 
WHAT DO YOU DO 
YOU END UP SHAGGING HIS WIFE AND THEN YOU PAY HER FOR IT 
I LOVE NICOLA DID JOHN GARRET TELL YOU TO DO THAT 
I LOVE NICOLA AND THE BOY THEN STAND UP AND BE COUNTED 
THAT'S JUST WHAT I'LL DO 
LET HIM GO SPENCE 
HE'S A MURDERING PIECE OF SHIT 
A MURDERING PIECE OF SHIT 
IS THAT HOW PEOPLE SEE ME 
WELL IF YOU DIE NOW ROBERT 
THEY JUST MIGHT 
MARK BENNET 
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 
HE WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND 
HOW DID HE DIE 
IF ALL THAT NEVER LEAVE A MAN BEHIND CRAP MEANS ANYTHING NOW IS THE TIME TO PROVE IT 
BECAUSE YOU CERTAINLY LEFT MARK BEHIND 
HE WAS MURDERED BUTCHERED DUMPED IN A SHALLOW GRAVE AND ALL THIS HAPPENED TO HIM WHEN HE WAS AT HOME 
WHEN HE SHOULD'VE BEEN SAFE JUST A MILE FROM HIS BARRACKS 
YOU SUCCEEDED WHERE SADDAM'S FINEST FAILED 
SAY SOMETHING FOR GOD'S SAKE 
WHY DOESN'T HE SAY ANYTHING 
WHY DOESN'T THIS MAN SPEAK WHY ARE YOU SO CONVINCED HE'S GUILTY 
HE WAS THERE AT THE BARRACKS HE'S IN A STATE OF TRAUMA 
I DON'T CARE HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED HE NEEDS A PSYCHIATRIST 
SO DO I JUST GET HIM IN HERE WILL YOU 
GET HIM IN HERE AND SIT HIM DOWN 
YEAH 
LOMAX 
I KNOW YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THE MURDERS OF MARK BENNET AND FRANCIS DUGGAN 
I HAVEN'T SEEN EITHER SINCE I LEFT THE REGIMENT 
APART FROM THE NIGHT THAT ONE WAS MURDERED AND THE OTHER VANISHED 
YOU SEEM INDIFFERENT TO THE FACT THAT THESE MEN ARE DEAD 
I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU MADE A DEAL WITH BADAWI 
AH LOMAX SIR 
NOW THIS IS MR. BADAWI 
HE'LL HELP QUELL THE VIOLENCE IN THE AREA IN EXCHANGE FOR AID AND MEDICINE 
I WANT YOU TO CO OPERATE WITH HIM FULLY 
AND I KNOW THAT BADAWI BEGAN TO SILENCE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE OUT AGAINST HIM 
THIS IS A COMPLETE FANTASY SHAHLA AHMED WAS ONE OF THEM 
HE DIDN'T SUCCEED BUT SHE WASN'T A THREAT TO YOU THEN SHE WAS JUST ON BADAWI'S HIT LIST 
IRAQ IS FULL OF ATROCITY VICTIMS LOOKING FOR HANDOUTS FROM THE WEST 
BUT SHE'S HERE NOW AND IF SHE HAS BRITISH SOLDIERS YOUR SOLDIERS 
TESTIFYING THAT THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER HAD THEM WORKING FOR BADAWI 
I'D NEVER EVEN HEARD OF BADAWI WHEN I WAS SERVING IN IRAQ 
I HAVE SOME INFLUENCE AMONGST THE PEOPLE 
I'M SURE WE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER 
THANK YOU COLONEL 
THANK YOU O. K. BOYS THANK YOU 
NEVER HEARD OF BADAWI THIS WAS ISSUED FROM ARMY INTELLIGENCE TO ALL OFFICERS SERVING IN IRAQ 
GROUP A WANTED WAR CRIMINAL BADAWI IT ALSO GIVES AN INSTRUCTION THAT OFFICERS 
SHOULD HAVE NO ASSOCIATION WITH BADAWI AT ALL BUT YOU MAKE A DEAL WITH HIM 
IT WAS OBVIOUS HE WAS GOING TO EXERT HIS AUTHORITY OVER YOU AT SOME POINT MAKE YOU DO HIS DIRTY WORK 
THIS IS HOW ATROCITIES HAPPEN HE HAD NO AUTHORITY OVER ME 
SO IT WAS YOUR ORDERS THAT ROUNDED UP THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOUR MEN TRUSTED YOU 
COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY 
AND YOU CORRUPTED THAT TRUST 
THIS WAS A WAR ZONE SOMETHING YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT 
THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE AGENTS TO MASS MURDER 
BUT THEY WERE NO LONGER SOLDIERS IN THE BRITISH ARMY THEY WERE IN YOUR PRIVATE MILITIA 
THE ORIGINAL IF YOU LIKE A. P. X. SOLUTIONS 
ANYTHING THESE BOYS ARE GUILTY OF HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME 
WOULD YOU CARE TO ELABORATE ON THAT FOR A SECOND 
I HAVE YOUR RIGHT HAND MAN ANDY TYRREL IN MY HOLDING CELL ON A CHARGE OF KILLING FRANCIS DUGGAN 
I HAVE YOU SITTING HERE WITH A PERFECT MOTIVE FOR KILLING MARK BENNET 
I TAKE IT THAT YOU'VE QUESTIONED ROBERT LOMAX ABOUT THE NIGHT OF THE REGIMENTAL DINNER 
YES I HAVE 
THIS IS REALLY HARD 
DID HE MENTION NICOLA BENNET 
IN RELATION TO THAT NIGHT 
SHOULD HE HAVE WHEN BENNET TURNED UP HE WASN'T JUST DRUNK HE WAS LOOKING FOR BLOOD 
ANYONE'S IN PARTICULAR YEAH ROBERT LOMAX 
THEY'D HAD A BIG FIGHT IN THE AFTERNOON AND SHE'D TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH ROB 
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMEONE BUT CHRIST I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME 
NO YOU WON'T 
OLDEST MOTIVE IN THE WORLD 
YOU WANT TO PUT BADAWI ME AND THE REGIMENT ON TRIAL 
BUT THE TRUTH IS SIMPLER SMALLER YOU OVERHEARD THIS ROW DID YOU 
I HEARD BENNET THREATEN TO KILL NICOLA BEFORE LOMAX COULD HAVE HER 
YOU FOR GOD'S SAKE PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER MAN 
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS BEFORE HE WAS LIKE A SON TO ME 
AND YOU'VE BEEN PROTECTING HIM ALL THIS TIME 
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT WE HAD TO HIDE BENNET'S CAR KEYS SO HE COULDN'T DRIVE HOME 
BUT HE RAN OFF INTO THE WOODS 
WHO WENT AFTER HIM 
LOMAX 
THE LAST I SAW OF HIM HE WAS HEADING TOWARDS THE STABLES 
YOU'RE SAYING THAT ROBERT LOMAX WENT AFTER MARK BENNET INTO THE WOODS WHAT HE SADDLED A HORSE DID HE 
AND THEN HE WENT CHASING BENNET ON HORSEBACK IS THIS WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME 
COME ON I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR YOU 
I KNOW YOU SEE ROBERT LOMAX AS A SON BUT I REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT 
YOU'RE MY ONLY WITNESS I BEG YOU 
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT LOMAX RODE AFTER BENNET ON HORSEBACK INTO THE WOODS IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED 
I THINK SO YOU THINK SO 
YES HE'S LYING 
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED HE'S A LIAR 
SHUT IT WE HAVE TO TELL EVERYONE WHAT WE DID 
YOU YOU LYING BASTARD BENNET 
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US FOR GOD'S SAKE PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER MAN 
I'M GONNA HELP SHAHLA 
I'M GONNA TELL EVERYONE WHAT YOU DID
