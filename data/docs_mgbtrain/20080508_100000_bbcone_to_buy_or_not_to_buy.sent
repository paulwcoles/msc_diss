VERY HIGH STANDARDS WE'RE IN TROUBLE AREN'T WE 
WHAT ABOUT THIS PLACE THEN WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR SPECIFICALLY 
TWO BEDROOMS 
A GOOD KITCHEN A GOOD SIZED KITCHEN 
I LOVE TO COOK AND HAVE BIG DINNER PARTIES AND ALL

I NEED TO HAVE A TABLE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM FOR DINNERS 
A GARDEN A NEARBY PARK 
AND OF COURSE A FIREPLACE WOULD BE SUPERB 
YOU NEED SOMEWHERE TO HUDDLE AND WHAT ABOUT THE LOCATION 
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GEOGRAPHY WHERE DO WANT THIS LITTLE DREAM MINIATURE PALACE TO BE LOCATED 
I LIVE IN THATCHAM I'VE BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS AND I'M HAPPY 
SO THATCHAM WOULD BE GREAT 
AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS THERE'S A GREAT LITTLE TOWN CALLED NEWBURY FIVE MINUTES AWAY 
YEAH COS YOU LIKE BERKSHIRE I DO I LOVE BERKSHIRE YES 
SHE'S SETTLING IN BECAUSE SHE'S SAYING BARKSHIRE WITH THE ROLL 
BARKSHIRE RIGHT BEFORE WE HEAD OFF I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ONE MORE TIME JUST TO GET IT IN MY HEAD

FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND IN NEWBURY 
IT'S A WORRY ISN'T IT IT CERTAINLY IS WE CAN DO IT

THE BEST PLAN OF ATTACK IS TO SPLIT UP AND COVER AS MUCH GROUND AS POSSIBLE RIGHT 
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE WORD ON THE STREET IS I'LL VISIT THE ESTATE AGENT'S 
ON SECOND THOUGHTS PERHAPS YOU SHOULD DO THE ESTATE AGENT'S AS YOU ARE DRESSED LIKE ONE 
HOW VERY DARE HIM 
INDEED HOW VERY VERY DARE HIM 
NEWBURY IN WEST BERKSHIRE LIES ON THE RIVER KENNET AND THE KENNET AND AVON CANAL 
IN FACT THE WATERWAYS FLOW RIGHT THROUGH THE HEART OF THE TOWN 
MANY BUILDINGS DATE FROM THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
BUT BUSINESS AROUND HERE IS A MODERN AFFAIR WITH HIGH TECH FIRMS 
IN THE WORLD OF MOBILE PHONES PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES AND BROADCASTING TECHNOLOGY 
NEWBURY HAS ALSO BEEN THE SITE OF SOME FAMOUS PROTESTS 
AGAINST THE LOCATING OF NUCLEAR MISSILE SITE GREENHAM COMMON 
AND A FAILED ATTEMPT TO STOP THE BUILDING OF NEWBURY BYPASS THROUGH LOCAL WOODLANDS 
BUT THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF UNSPOILT COUNTRYSIDE 
AND QUIET PRETTY VILLAGES JUST OUTSIDE THE SUBURBS OF THE TOWN 
NEWBURY IS ALSO RENOWNED FOR ITS RACECOURSE 
BUT WHAT CAN WENDY GET FOR HER MONEY AROUND THE REST OF THE U. K. 
IN WESTGATE ON SEA IN KENT THIS IS A ONE BEDROOMED FLAT IN A MODERN DEVELOPMENT 
THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM ARE THE REAL SELLERS HERE 
THE ASKING PRICE IS WELL BELOW WENDY'S BUDGET AT JUST 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS FOUR BEDROOM TOWN HOUSE 
IN THE POPULAR AREA OF NEWCASTLE UNDER LYME IN STAFFORDSHIRE 
WITH A MODERN KITCHEN AND SPACIOUS LOUNGE IT WEIGHS IN AT 
VERY NICE INDEED BUT WE'VE ALSO COME UP WITH THIS THREE BEDROOMED SEMI IN BELFAST 
IT'S A VILLA STYLE PROPERTY SO THE HUGE BAY WINDOWS ARE 
A PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE FEATURE IT'S ON THE MARKET AT 
BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT IS I'M NOT SURE I COULD PERSUADE 
WENDY TO MOVE TO NORTHERN IRELAND FOR SOME GREAT HOUSES 
I'VE GOT TO FIND A GREAT HOUSE OR TWO RIGHT HERE IN NEWBURY 
I'M ABOUT TO GET SOME PROPERTY POINTERS FROM THE PEOPLE 
ON THE STREET AND I'M SURE DISCOVER SOME LOCAL COLOUR ON THE WAY

I DON'T THINK YOU WILL NO 
WITH THE GRAND BUDGET OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND RIGHT O. K. 
I SAW THE CAKE IT MADE MY DAY AND YOU DEFLATED ME 
I'VE GONE FLAT LIKE A SOUFFLE 
I'M GUESSING THAT'S THE KIND OF LOWER END OF THE MARKET 
HAVE YOU ANYTHING IN THAT RANGE AT ALL YES WE DO 
YOU CAN FIND THAT IT BE IMPOSSIBLE 
AH NOW THEN SHE DID SAY SHE LIKED PERIOD PROPERTIES 
WHERE WOULD YOU BUY FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
SHE CAN'T EVEN AFFORD CLOTHES 
AND WE DO HAVE THIS PROPERTY THAT'S SITUATED IN CENTRAL NEWBURY AH RIGHT 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND FOR A HOUSE IN NEWBURY OR AM I BEING COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS 
YES YES ANY MORE TAKERS ON YES 
NOT QUITE WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR THIS KITCHEN'S A BIT SMALL

THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
CHRISTIAN'S POUNDED THE STREETS I'VE CHATTED UP 
THE LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS AND I THINK IT'S BEEN WORTH IT 
IT'S BEEN WORTH THE AGONY AND PAIN IT HAS 
DESPITE THE BUDGETARY RESTRICTIONS I THINK WE'VE CAUGHT SOME CORKERS 
HERE MATE PARTICULARLY ME WHAT HAVE YOU CAUGHT 
FIRST OF ALL I'M GOING TO GO FOR AN APARTMENT IN THIS VICTORIAN PERIOD PROPERTY IN NEWBURY 
THE OUTSIDE ISN'T ALL THAT BUT INSIDE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET SOMEWHERE 
WE'VE GOT GREAT FEATURES LOTS OF SPACE NICE COLOURS LOOK AT THAT 
IT'S LIKE A RAINBOW IN THERE 
WHILE HE'S BEEN GOING WITH PERIOD VICTORIANA I'M GOING PERIOD THE DECADE I WAS BORN THE SEVENTIES 
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS REMINISCENT OF YOU ISN'T IT 
BIT PLAIN AND GETTING PAST ITS BEST 
YOU MEAN A DESIGN CLASSIC 
IT'S A GREAT PROPERTY IT'S GOT THE SPACE INSIDE IT'S MODERN 
BUT WILL THEY TO PERCEIVE THEMSELVES IN THERE WE SHALL SEE 
WE'VE ALSO BANGED OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH A JOINT CHOICE 
WE HAVE YES THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE BECAUSE WENDY REALLY WANTED 
THE KIND OF CUTESY THATCHED COTTAGE IT'S NOT QUITE THATCHED BUT IT'S IT'S GOT IT IN SPADES 
A VERY CUTESY COTTAGE AND IT'S IN A LOVELY QUIET STREET AS WELL 
AND IT'S GOT THE FIREPLACE 
THERE'S ONE LITTLE PROBLEM BUT THEY MIGHT LIKE IT 
RIGHT SIMON WE NOW HAVE OUR WITH THREE PROPERTIES YEAH 
LET'S COMMENCE THE VIEWINGS AT PROPERTY ONE 
PROPERTY NUMBER ONE IS MY CHOICE AND GIVES WENDY SOME OF THAT OLD ENGLISH CHARM SHE WAS ASKING FOR 
IT'S A TWO BEDROOM FIRST FLOOR APARTMENT IN A VICTORIAN TOWNHOUSE 
IT'S A STONE'S THROW FROM NEWBURY TOWN CENTRE BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE 
YOU'VE DELIVERED ON THE QUIET BIT OF THE REQUEST BUT WE SHALL SEE 
IT DOES HAVE CHARACTER I CAN CERTAINLY HEAR SOME JEALOUSY THERE 
LARGE LOUNGE BIG BEDROOM FULLY FITTED KITCHEN IT WILL WIN HER OVER 
O. K. LADIES OUR FIRST HOUSE IS MY CHOICE 
WHEN I SAY HOUSE I MEAN A FLAT IN A LOVELY OLD VICTORIAN PROPERTY 
SO WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT QUINCY KIND OF FEEL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 
IT HAS EXCELLENT COMMUNICATIONS 
WHAT YOU'RE MEANING TO TRANSLATE IT'S ON A MAIN ROAD 
WENDY FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
IT'S NOT BAD IT LOOKS QUITE NICE 
THE ONLY DOWNER IS THE ROAD IT LOOKS A BIT BUSY AND QUITE NOISY 
YOU'RE UNUSUALLY QUIET 
YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY LIKE THE STYLE OF THIS PROPERTY SO I'M VERY KEEN TO TAKE A LOOK INSIDE 
THE APARTMENT IS AT THE BACK SO YOU ARE GIVING A BIT OF 
A COLD SHOULDER TO ALL THAT TRAFFIC YOU DON'T HEAR IT 
WHAT I THINK IS ALSO INTERESTING ABOUT THIS APARTMENT IT'S GOT A VERY REFRESHING LAYOUT 
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL FIND THAT UNCONVENTIONAL LAYOUT INTERESTING 
GO ON GO AND HAVE A LOOK TELL US WHAT YOU THINK 
SO WHAT WAS ALL ABOUT COMMUNICATION LINKS WHEN YOU MEANT ROAD IT'S TRUE 
YOU CAN GET ANYWHERE FROM THERE 
SIMON THAT'S ESTATE AGENT SPEAK THAT'S ESTATE AGENT WEAR 
GREAT DOOR ISN'T IT 
I WONDER IF YOUR FIRST PROPERTY IS GOING TO BE A FIRECRACKER OR A DAMP SQUIB 
THIS PLACE ISN'T CONVENTIONAL BUT THESE GIRLS HAVE GOT THE IMAGINATION TO TAKE IT ON 
LET'S FIND OUT OH THIS IS LOVELY 
OH VERY NICE IT'S LOVELY ISN'T IT 
THIS IS LOVELY OH COME ON SHE'S ONLY STEPPED OVER THE DOOR 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE EVERYTHING I LIKE THE HIGH CEILINGS 
YEAH IT'S GREAT ISN'T IT I'M NOT SO KEEN ON THE ORANGE WALLS WHAT ABOUT YOU 
NO COLOUR CAN CHANGE COLOUR CAN CHANGE 
IT'S A TANGERINE DREAM UP THERE ISN'T IT 
IT'S A GREAT SIZE IT'S A GOOD SIZE AND IT'S GOT THE FIREPLACE 
SIMON YOU ARE A GOD 
THE HOLY GRAIL IS THE FIREPLACE 
I AM A GOD I BELIEVE WAS JUST SAID I AM A GOD 
THAT'S JUST WHAT I WANT PERFECT THAT'S A LOVELY FEATURE IN HERE 
THEY SEEM SO EXCITED ABOUT THE FIREPLACE I'M CONCERNED 
BECAUSE BETWEEN YOU AND ME MY CHOICE DOESN'T HAVE A FIREPLACE 
DOES IT NOT NO 
BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO GLOAT IT DOESN'T SUIT YOU DEARIE ME STOP 
FANCY THAT WHEN THE ONE THING SHE ASKED FOR WAS A FIREPLACE THAT LOOKS GOOD 
THIS IS A NICE SIZED ROOM 
IT IS LOVELY ISN'T IT WOW 
A BASIN TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH JUST BEFORE YOU JUMP IN BED 
I THINK ORAL HYGIENE BEFORE YOU GO TO BED IS A NICE THING 
REALLY BIG SIZE BEDROOM I COULD FIT MY KING SIZE IN HERE EASILY 
IT'S PERFECT 
LITTLE BALCONY A LITTLE FIRE ESCAPE OR WHATEVER IT IS 
YOU CAN OPEN THE DOOR THERE AND HAVE A FEW PLANTS OUT THERE 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE GREAT LOVELY FLING IT OPEN LET THE SUMMER BREEZE WALTZ INTO YOUR BEDROOM I LOVE IT 
THE BLUE ROOM WOW 
THIS MUST BE THE SECOND ROOM IT'S QUITE SMALL ISN'T IT 
YOU'VE DISAPPOINTED THE GIRLS ON SIZE 
I'M SURE THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME NOW COME ON 
WHAT DO THEY WANT FOR THEIR MONEY A LARGER ROOM 
IT'S A GOOD COLOUR A GOOD CHOICE OF COLOUR AND BLINDS 
FOR A SECOND BEDROOM WITH THEIR BUDGET IT'S IT'S VERY GOOD 
SIMON'S DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB SIMON'S DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB 
I'M NOT SAYING THE PRESSURE IS ON 
OH THE BATHROOM WE'RE ABOUT TO GO INTO THE BATHROOM 
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME BEFORE THEY GO IN THERE 
THE BATHROOM THERE ISN'T TECHNICALLY A BATH 
SO THEREFORE IT'S JUST A ROOM OH IT'S TINY ISN'T IT 
IT'S VERY NICE AND MODERN MY GOODNESS NICELY DONE BUT IT'S TINY 
FIRST THING I'VE NOTICED IS NO BATH 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING SIMON SHOWING TWO GIRLS A HOUSE WITHOUT 
A BATHROOM EVERY WOMAN NEEDS A PAMPERING SPACE HER LUXURY 
A HA 
WOW WHAT A GREAT KITCHEN IT'S MASSIVE ISN'T IT 
THINK I'M BACK ON TRACK YOU ARE WOWING THEM EVERY STEP OF THE WAY 
IT'S GOT A NICE FEEL TO IT NICE AND CLEAN AND WHITE 
I ALWAYS LIKE A CLEAN KITCHEN MYSELF YES IT'S COS YOU NEVER COOK IN IT 
WELL THE ODD MICROWAVE MEAL WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT 
IT'S A BIT OLD FASHIONED YOU COULD CHANGE THE CUPBOARD DOORS 
NICE NEUTRAL COLOUR SCHEME 
I CAN SEE MYSELF COOKING A BIG DINNER PARTY AND YOU CAN ALSO FIT A FEW PEOPLE IN WHILE I'M COOKING 
YOU COULD SIT IN AND HAVE A GLASS OF WINE WHILE I'M COOKING 
I DO LIKE THE ALL ROUND FEEL OF THIS PLACE IT FEELS LIKE HOME 
WELL THAT IS THE BIGGEST COMPLIMENT YOU ARE EVER GOING TO BE PAID 
WHAT I DID NOTICE HERE IS THAT THEY SEEM HAVE DOUBLE GLAZING BUT IN THE 
REST OF THE HOUSE OR IN THE LOUNGE IT'S GOT THE OLD STYLE WINDOWS THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
THERE ARE SOME WINDOWS THAT NEED WORK DOING TO THEM 
THE OLD SASH WINDOWS THEY HAVE DAMAGE BUT NOT STRAIGHTAWAY 
IT'S SOMETHING THEY CAN MOVE IN AND DO AT A LATER STAGE 
IT'S GOT A GOOD FEEL IT IS REALLY GOOD LET'S GO AND CHAT TO THE GUYS 
I'M A GOD ME SHE WAS REFERRING TO 
THIS FEELS LIKE HOME 
DO I REALLY NEED TO SELL THIS FLAT ANY MORE TO THESE LADIES 
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE DRAWN YOUR CONCLUSIONS ALREADY 
BUT IT WOULDN'T HURT TO GET IN THERE COME ON 
I KNOW YOU KIND OF LIKE THIS FLAT BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS YOU'RE NOT HAPPY WITH 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH YOU THINK THIS ROOM IS TOO SMALL AS A BEDROOM 
AND CAN I TAKE YOU BY THE HAND COME WITH ME 
YOU ALSO WOULD PREFER IF WE HAD A BATH 
FIRST OF ALL YOU COULD DEFINITELY FIT A BATH INTO THIS ROOM 
THAT'S FIVE F. T. NINE YOU ARE AS TALL AS YOUR ARM SPAN 
SO THAT'S THAT PROBLEM SOLVED 
YOU'RE A GENIUS CONTINUE CONTINUE COME WITH ME 
I KNOW YOU LIKE THE NICE BIG KITCHEN BUT THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER ROOM THAN THE SPARE ROOM ISN'T IT 
IT IS YEAH SO WHY DON'T WE MAKE THIS THE SECOND BEDROOM YOUR HAND AGAIN PLEASE 
AND THIS ROOM IS YOUR KITCHEN WHAT A GREAT IDEA 
IT'S NOT A BIG PROBLEM FURTHERMORE JUST TO FINISH THAT OFF 
IT'S ONLY A STUD WALL SO WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM YOU CAN KNOCK A HOLE IN HERE 
MAKE THIS INTO A BREAKFAST BAR AND WHEN YOU COOK YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR GUESTS RELAXING IN THE LOUNGE 
YOU'RE A GENIUS WHAT A GREAT IDEA 
ROMANY THIS ISN'T VERY GLAMOROUS THAT IS THE CAR PARKING SPACE 
SO TWO VEHICLES HERE WHICH I THINK IS QUITE GENEROUS 
THAT IS GOOD 
YOU'LL LIKE THIS EVEN BETTER COS IF WE PUSH OUR WAY THROUGH READY 
WE HAVE THE LOST GARDEN OF HELIGAN ALMOST 
THE SECRET GARDEN SO TAKE MY HAND 
IT'S NOT HUGE BUT IT'S VERY WELL EXECUTED 
YOU GOT A NICE BIT OF DECKING GRAVEL LOVELY OLD RECLAIMED BRICKS 
LOTS OF TEXTURE LOTS OF PLANTS 
THE BARBECUE 
OVER HERE A LITTLE RUSTIC TABLE MADE OUT OF A CABLE DRUM 
CAN YOU FEEL THE SUMMER THAT WOULD COST A FORTUNE IN AN ANTIQUES SHOP 
THAT'S COME OUT OF A OLD MECHANICAL WORKSHOP FIVE YEARS AGO 
CAN YOU SEE THE LIFESTYLE HERE YES I LIKE IT 
OH MY GOODNESS I'M SUCH A GENT A LITTLE GLASS OF CLARET LOOK AT THIS 
NOW COME ON I KNOW THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE YOUR PROPERTY 
SHALL WE TOAST WENDY'S P. R. O. P. E. R. T. Y. TWO 
THE QUESTION IS CAN SHE AFFORD IT 
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT NOW OOH OH HELLO 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU NOT TO YOU 
WE ONLY HAVE TWO GLASSES 
WE'VE BEEN HOLDING HANDS UPSTAIRS 
WENDY WILL JUST HAVE THE BOTTLE 
YOU'LL IT WHEN I TELL YOU WHAT IT'S WORTH SHALL WE GUESS 
O. K. LET'S GET SERIOUS FOR A SECOND YOU SAW SIMON'S FIRST CHOICE 
WHEN WE SHOW YOU A PROPERTY WE WANT YOU TO GUESS THE VALUE OF EACH HOUSE 
WE'LL FIND OUT WHO REALLY HAS THE BRAINS HERE 
SO O. K. WHO'S GOING TO GO FIRST 
ROMANY COME ON WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
I'D PROBABLY SAY GUTTING INSTINCT SHOULD BE AROUND ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
GUTTING INSTINCT TERRIFYING LET'S GO WITH GUT INSTINCT 
WHAT ABOUT YOU 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR IT 
WELL MY GUTTING INSTINCT IS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND 
SO ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND IT'S ONE ZERO TO WENDY 
BUT YOU WERE BOTH VERY CLOSE BECAUSE THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THIS PROPERTY ON THE MARKET IS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
SO GOOD GUESSING GIRLS 
BUT MORE FULL BODIED BETTER QUALITY FINE VINTAGE 
MY CHOICE THIS WAY MORE LIKELY TO BE CHEAP PLONK 
IF WENDY IS STILL DREAMING ABOUT LIVING 
IN PROPERTY NUMBER ONE SHE NEEDS INTO ACCOUNT IT IS A LEASEHOLD 
THAT MEANS A MONTHLY SERVICE CHARGE OF FIFTY WHICH COVERS MAINTENANCE 
THE EXTERIOR AND FABRIC OF THE BUILDING AND INSURANCE 
SIMON YOU'VE GONE SLIGHTLY OVER OUR BUDGET 
BUT WENDY COULD RENT OUT THE SECOND BEDROOM FOR AROUND TWO HUNDRED PER MONTH 
ENOUGH TO COVER THE EXTRA MORTGAGE 
I'VE WHISKED WENDY OVER THE BORDER INTO HAMPSHIRE TO A CHARMING VILLAGE CALLED KINGSCLERE 
IT'S A TWO BED FIRST FLOOR MODERN STYLE APARTMENT 
KINGSCLERE WAS VOTED BEST VILLAGE IN THE COUNTY IN TWO THOUSAND THREE 
BUT KRISTIAN COME ON WHERE IS THE CHARACTER WENDY WAS LOOKING FOR 
IT'S A NEAT FLAT WITH ALL THE ACCOMMODATION SHE NEEDS 
IF WENDY WANTS TO LIVE IN A PRETTY VILLAGE THIS IS A ROUTE IN 
GIRLS I HAVE BEEN OUTRAGEOUS FOR MY CHOICE OF PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
I'VE TAKING YOU OUT OF YOUR BELOVED BERKSHIRE AND TAKEN YOU OVER TO THE VERY POSH AND AFFLUENT HAMPSHIRE 
OH ARE WE HAPPY ABOUT THAT 
YES WHY'S THAT I LOVE HAMPSHIRE WHY I LIVE IN HAMPSHIRE 
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH ISN'T IT I'M SUCH A LOVELY GUY YES SIMON 
O. K. AND NOT ANY OLD PART OF HAMPSHIRE ONE OF THE MOST AWARD WINNING VILLAGES IN HAMPSHIRE 
KINGSCLERE 
NOT AN OUTDATED COTTAGE WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU IS FAR MORE MODERN 
I'M SHOWING YOU A FLAT IN THIS RATHER MODERN APARTMENT BLOCK 
DO WE LIKE OR DESPISE I THINK IS QUITE COOL ACTUALLY 
IT REMINDS ME OF A CASTLE 
NOT SO MUCH A PALACE MORE A CASTLE 
THERE'S ONE GOOD REASON FOR THAT 
A FLAT ROOF CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS WHAT STATE OF REPAIR IS IT IN 
THE ROOF IS IN PERFECT CONDITION IT'S JUST BEEN REPLACED 
AND I WANT TO REPLACE HIM 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ROMANY 
I THINK MY GRAN WOULD LOVE IT 
YOUR GRAN MUST HAVE GREAT TASTE THEN 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR CASTELLATIONS ON THE TOP THERE 
YOU COULD DO WITH A NICE PORTCULLIS OVER THE GARAGE THERE 
SEE ALL MY CASTLE TERMS 
GIRLS GO INSIDE AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK 
O. K. GO FOR IT OFF YOU GO 
ARE THEY BEING POLITE 
I THINK YOU'VE WON WENDY OVER YES BUT I DON'T THING ROMANY IS SURE 
WENDY IS THE ONLY ONE I CARE ABOUT 
IT REMINDS ME OF A FIRE STATION 
WHY BECAUSE OF THE RED BALUSTRADES 
YES WITHOUT THE POLE 
THAT WOULD BE KIND OF COOL 
I'M SURPRISED HOW POSITIVE THEY WERE ABOUT THIS PLACE 
NO IT'S CONTEMPORARY 
BUT IT'S THE INSIDE THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW 
THIS IS NICE IT'S COSY 
BIT SMALL IT MIGHT JUST BE ALL OF THE FURNITURE 
AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF 
COSY SMALL 
YEAH YEAH ARE YOU HAVING A JIBE 
LOTS OF WINE WHERE'S THE WINE THERE 
I LOVE THE BIG WINDOWS 
YOU CAN WATCH THE PASSERS BY AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
YEAH YOU CAN SEE WHEN I'M ARRIVING 
I LIKE THAT STYLE AND THE FROSTED GLASS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE A GENT AH THE KITCHEN OH IT'S TINY 
PROBLEM MATE 
YEAH THERE IS A PROBLEM RIGHT ABOUT HERE 
IT'S NOT THAT GREAT COS I LIKE TO HAVE THE BIG DINNER PARTIES 
GREAT VIEWS OUT OF THE WINDOWS 
VERY PRETTY THAT'S A SWEET KITCHEN 
SWEET BEING THE WORD IT'S NOT MASSIVE 
A GOOD WORKABLE SPACE I DON'T THINK WE COULD FIT OUR POTS AND PANS IN 
I THINK A REAL A BIT OF REPLANNING AND IT WOULD 
YOU COULD UTILISE IT MUCH BETTER 
THE UNITS WOULD NEED REPLACING PERHA P. S. BUT IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE 
NO NOT FOR A KITCHEN THAT SIZE 
AH THE BATHROOM 
LOOK AT THAT AVOCADO SUITE 
I WOULD NEUTRALISE THE SUITE NEUTRALISE THE SUITE WHITE 
GOT A PROBLEM WITH AVOCADO HAVE YOU WHAT IS IT 
COME ON RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW 
BATHROOM SUITES ANY COLOUR YOU WANT AS LONG AS IT IS WHITE 
I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED AN AVOCADO SUITE 
NO I THINK IT'S NICE THOUGH 
THE SIZE IS FINE IT'S NO DIFFERENT FROM WHERE I LIVE AT THE MOMENT 
YOU CAN KIND OF FIT EVERYTHING IN 
BATH SHOWER TOILET AND SINK I THINK IT'S FINE 
THE REST OF THE BATHROOM IS FINE IN TERMS OF THE SPACE AND LAYOUT 
IT'S NOT AVOCADO HATRED GO ON IT'S A COLOUR HATRED 
SMALL BEDROOM THE SECOND ROOM 
THEY'VE PUT THE BED INTO THE CUPBOARD 
O. K. THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THE SIZE OF THE SECOND BEDROOM BUT 
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR THIS MONEY 
IT'S A BIT LOUDER VENT THE ANGER THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING 
AH THIS IS NICE IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE 
CAN SHE NOT THEREFORE COMPROMISE ON THE SIZE OF THE SECOND BEDROOM 
WHAT WILL HIT WENDY IS THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE COMPROMISE 
IT'S KIND OF THE CASTLE EFFECT THAT I SAW OUTSIDE 
YOU DON'T QUITE SEE ANY OF THOSE SLIGHTLY OLDER FEATURES IN HERE 
IT DOESN'T REFLECT THE OUTSIDE 
I QUITE LIKE THE BLUE SLASH PURPLE 
LIKING THE COLOUR SCHEME 
DELICATE LILAC AIDS THE SLEEP 
IT'S A NICE AIRY BRIGHT COLOURED FLAT 
YOU'D LIKE TO PAINT EACH ROOM THE COLOUR OF YOUR OWN YEAH 
SO YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A HEAD START THERE 
I TELL YOU WHAT'S PECULIAR NOT YOU 
I CAN'T TELL YOU IF THOSE GIRLS LIKE THAT APARTMENT OR REALLY DISLIKE IT 
H. M. M. PROS AND CONS WASN'T IT WE NEED TO SELL THE PROS MORE 
WENDY CONFIDE IN ME DO YOU LOVE THAT APARTMENT OR NOT 
IT WAS QUITE GOOD YES 
THIS VILLAGE IS PRIME PRIME STUFF 
QUINTESSENTIALLY ENGLISH 
LOVELY OLD PUBS THE CHURCH BARS CAFES RESTAURANTS 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SETTING FOR A MISS MARPLE SCENE DOESN'T IT 
IT DOES IT'S LOVELY 
I'VE PICKED IT BECAUSE BEING A CLASSY KIND OF GIRL 
IT'S A LIFESTYLE YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO 
LET'S DO A ROLL CALL OF SOME OF THE NEIGHBOURS THAT LIVE HERE 
O. K. SO 
ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER RING ANY BELLS 
INDEED WRITTEN A FEW DITTIES QUITE FAMOUS

LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT 
ROMANY I DETECTED EVEN WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING AT THIS PLACE THAT THIS ISN'T YOUR KIND OF PERIOD IS IT 
NOT FROM THE OUTSIDE 
I'VE ACTUALLY SPENT A BIT MORE TIME HERE NOW AND SEEN THAT IT IS QUITE A QUIET AREA AND 
O. K. THE SEVENTIES GAVE US DAVID CASSIDY AND STACK HEELED SHOES 
BUT NOT EVERYTHING WAS BAD ABOUT IT YOU KNOW 
SOME THINGS IN THIS FLAT ARE WORTH BEARING IN MIND 
THIS GLASS HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS IT'S NOT MY TASTE 
YOU DON'T LIKE IT NO I'LL CONVINCE YOU TO LOVE IT 
RIGHT OH I'M GONNA TRY 
REEDED TEARDROP GLASS AND IT'S ORIGINAL TO THIS APARTMENT 
AS ARE THE PLAIN DOORS AS ARE THE FITTED VENEER WARDROBES O. K. 
NOW TOO OFTEN PEOPLE TEAR THESE OUT OF SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES PROPERTIES BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S HORRIBLE 
I ASSURE YOU IT WILL ADD VALUE TO THIS PROPERTY 
BEAR IN MIND THAT THIRTY YEARS AGO PEOPLE COULDN'T DO ENOUGH 
TO GET RID OF RANGES AND VICTORIAN FIREPLACES TRUE 
NOW IF IT'S NOT GOT AN ORIGINAL FIREPLACE IT DEVALUES THE PROPERTY 
YOU MIGHT CONVINCE ME TO KEEP THESE BUT YOU CERTAINLY WOULDN'T GET ME TO KEEP THOSE VENEERED CUPBOARD DOORS 
LET'S SEE IF I CAN CONVINCE YOU BY FINDING OUT WHAT IT'S WORTH O. K. 
LET'S SEE WHAT IT'S WORTH 
A LITTLE BIT OF A POST MODERNIST CASTLE

OFF STREET PARKING AND A LOVELY QUIET VILLAGE LOCATION 
I'LL TAKE IT NO IT'S NOT FOR YOU

AN UGLY CHEAT FORGET ABOUT THAT PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE WILD CARD

AT THE FULL LENGTH WINDOWS TO MAKE SURE IT'S ALL SAFETY GLASS 
IS WENDY REALLY READY FOR THE CHANGE IN THE PACE OF LIFE AND THE EXTRA DISTANCE TO WORK 
FINALLY PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE WILD CARD 
IT'S GOT CHARACTER 
IN A QUIET PART OF NEWBURY JUST TO THE WEST OF THE TOWN CENTRE 
SO WHY IS IT WILD 
BECAUSE OF THE IMAGINATION REQUIRED 
THERE'S NO ONWARD CHAIN AND THE CURRENT OWNER HAS ALREADY LEFT 
AND UNLIKE OUR FIRST TWO CHOICES IT'S ONE GOT ONE BEDROOM BUT IT'S A HOUSE RATHER THAN AN APARTMENT 
LADIES OUR THIRD PROPERTY IS OUR WILD CARD

IT'S LIKE AN ENLARGED DOLL'S HOUSE BUT NOT TOO ENLARGED 
JUST ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN GET IN 
THIS IS BRIGHT 
IT'S LOVELY ISN'T IT BACK DOOR OUT INTO THE BACK TINY BACK GARDEN 
I'M NOT BEING FUNNY EVIDENTLY IT'S NOT IN MY NATURE BUT I DON'T THINK WENDY IS MUCH OF A GARDENER ANYWAY 
I LIKE THE KITCHEN IT'S NEW ISH 
WHAT'S OUT THE BACK 
LET'S SEE GET A SUN LOUNGER OUT HERE IN THE SUMMER 
THEY WANT A SUN LOUNGER A GLASS OF WINE THE GIRLS WILL BE HAPPY 
I HOPE THAT'S NOT YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S BEDROOM WINDOW IT'LL MEAN NO SUN LOUNGER 
YOU WOULDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE SUMMER EVENINGS HAVING A BARBECUE NOT REALLY 
THE NEIGHBOURS ARE A BIT CLOSE 
IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THESE KIND OF PROPERTIES THAT THEY WERE BUILT VERY CLOSE TOGETHER 
BUT IT'S A SENSE OF COMMUNITY YOU GET ON WELL WITH YOUR NEIGHBOURS 
OH MY GOODNESS 
THIS MUST BE THE BEDROOM TINY ISN'T IT I DON'T THINK MY BIG BED WOULD FIT IN HERE 
RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS 
THIS IS THE LANDING 
YES I LOVE THAT IT'S GOT A FIREPLACE 
I WONDER IF THAT COULD WORK 
I DON'T LIKE THIS NO IT'S MARBLE EFFECT CHEESY 
CHEESY 
I WONDER WHY THE WHOLE PLACE IS TILED 
I MEAN IT'S NOT A BIG ISSUE YOU COULD CARPET OVER IT 
TILES BELONG IN THE BATHROOM OR THE GROUND FLOOR YES 
YOU CAN SEE THE PUB RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD SO I GUESS EVERYONE IN THE PUB CAN SEE RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD 
EVERYONE WILL BE WENDY'S GOING TO BED NOW 
SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT EVERYONE FROM THE PUB SEEING HER GOING TO BED SHE'D BE IN THE PUB WOULDN'T SHE 
YES 
HAVE A LOOK IN THIS 
I EXPECTED SOMETHING TO JUMP OUT 
THAT'S A GOOD CUPBOARD SPACE IT'S NOT A BAD CUPBOARD FOR A SINGLE PERSON 
THERE'S SOME BUILT IN WARDROBES WHICH ARE ALWAYS VERY APPEALING TO THE LADY WITH SHOES 
A MASSIVE BIG WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT AGAIN 
LOFT HATCH TO GET UP THERE I KNOW IT'S GOT THE STEPS BUT 
DON'T 
SPIDERS 
SHALL WE LOOK AT THE BATHROOM LET'S WALK THROUGH 
OH A SKYLIGHT 
YOU SEE THIS IS LOVELY IT'S LIKE A LITTLE STUDY ISN'T IT A DRESSING ROOM 
YES I'D MAKE IT A LITTLE STUDY FOR MY COMPUTER OR SOMETHING 
THAT'S A GOOD POINT YOU'D ALMOST WANT THAT THERE SO AT LEAST YOU HAVE A BIT OF A LANDING 
GUESTS GOING TO THE LOO SEE IF YOUR ROOM'S TIDY THEY'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH YOUR BEDROOM 
IT HAS TO BE TIDY THAT'S THE DOWNSIDE 
BEDROOMS SHOULD ALWAYS BE TIDY OH DEAR 
DON'T YOU MAKE YOUR BED FIRST THING 
NO ONCE A MONTH WHETHER IT NEEDS IT OR NOT THE BEDROOM GETS TIDIED 
STANDARDS NO STANDARDS OBVIOUSLY 
WOW THE BATHROOM'S REALLY MODERN ISN'T IT NICE BATHROOM 
BASICALLY THE SAME STORY AS THE KITCHEN ISN'T IT 
THE BATHROOM IS SMALL BUT BEAUTIFULLY APPOINTED YES 
YOU NEED TO DO NOTHING NOTHING 
VERY CUTE THE WHOLE PLACE IS NICELY REDECORATED 
AGAIN THE FLOOR'S NOT GREAT WITH THE WOODEN TILES BUT THE BATHROOM'S REALLY SWEET 
A TINY LITTLE WINDOW BUT AGAIN A WINDOW ALL THE SAME 
I LIKE THIS BATHROOM 
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS PLACE BESIDES THE INITIAL BUYING IT OF COURSE 
AND PERHAPS PUTTING SOME CARPETS DOWN 
OTHERWISE IT'S KIND OF READY TO MOVE IN YES 
SHALL WE GO AND FIND THEM 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HARD IN THERE IS IT 
THIS HOUSE HAS BEEN SO BEAUTIFULLY FINISHED ON THE INSIDE HASN'T IT 
IT HAS HASN'T IT AND YET ON CLOSER INSPECTION OUTSIDE 
ISN'T IT A BIT ODD IT IS THE POLE AND THE DOOR 
IT WOULDN'T TAKE TOO MUCH TO SMARTEN IT UP OUT HERE 
NO NOT AT ALL 
YOU COULD JUST GET A POWER CLEANER YOU CERTAINLY COULD 
SOME TERRACOTTA POTS THAT'D BE NICE 
YOU KNOW WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE 
THIS PIECE OF LAND HERE 
WE DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS IT 
NO BUT HOW USEFUL WOULD THAT BE FOR EXTRA PARKING 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT FOR SALE RIGHT NOW 
YOU COULD VERY EASILY GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR LOCAL LAND REGISTRY OFFICE AND SEND THEM A SKETCH 
THEY'LL WORK OFF SOME ROUGH DRAWINGS 
AND THEY WILL HELP YOU FIND OUT WHO OWNS IT 
AND WHO KNOWS MAKE THEM AN OFFER 
NO ONE'S USING IT YOU NEVER KNOW 
I DOESN'T LOOK MUCH LOVED DOES IT 
NO LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN LEFT 
ROMANY HOP OUT INTO THE BACK GARDEN OR SHOULD WE SAY THE PETITE GARDEN 
AND THIS TIME NO BOTTLES OF WINE I'M AFRAID 
IT'S NOT SOCIABLE ENOUGH YET FOR THAT TO HAPPEN NO 
SO PLONK YOURSELF HERE WITHOUT THE PLONK AND IMAGINE IF WE WERE HERE LOOK AT THE BUILDING 
THE BEHIND IS NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE IS IT NO I'M GLAD YOU CAN SEE THAT 
I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE SELLING IT TO ME NOW YOU'VE GOT A BIG SCAR WHERE A WINDOW WAS 
THE PAINTWORK'S FLAKING NOT ATTRACTIVE NO 
ONCE THAT IS REDECORATED IT INSTANTLY LOOKS BETTER 
SOME OF THE BEST GARDENS I'VE EVER SEEN HAVE BEEN NO LARGER THAN THIS AND THEY USE CLEVER TRICKS 
FOR INSTANCE PUT A LARGE PIECE OF MIRROR THERE AND PIECE OF TRELLIS RIGHT AROUND IT 
LIKE AN ARCHWAY GROW SOMETHING ROUND IT AND WHEN YOU COME OUT IT SEEMS BIGGER 
TUNNELS DISAPPEARING OFF 
YOU GIRLS DON'T WANT TO DO GARDENING 
YOU'RE INTO SHOPPING MORE THAN GARDENING AREN'T YOU YEAH 
YEAH SO THIS BEING SMALL IS A BIG BONUS 
BUT CAN YOU AFFORD THE PRICE 
IT'S GUESS THE PRICE TIME AND NO CHEATING THIS TIME 
PLEASE PLEASE WHAT PLEASE TELL ME THE PRICE PRETTY PLEASE 
NO I DON'T WORK WITH CHEATS WITH CREAM AND A CHERRY ON TOP 
I'M NOT CHEATING I'M JUST BEING CARELESS WITH THE PROPERTY DETAILS I WOULD'VE BEEN WAY OUT WITH THAT 
REALLY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THEM HAVE YOU SHH DON'T TELL THE OTHERS 
IF WENDY AND THE WILD CARD ARE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN 
SHE'D HAVE TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT HER NEIGHBOURS 
THE CLIENTS OF THE FUNERAL DIRECTORS AREN'T GOING TO BE NOISY 
BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE ACTIVITY AT VARIOUS TIMES OF THE DAY 
AND WITHOUT A STICK OF FURNITURE IN HERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO JUDGE 
HOW BIG THE ROOMS ARE AND IF THINGS WILL FIT 
RETURNING WITH THE DIMENSIONS OF HER FURNITURE WILL ALLAY ANY OF WENDY'S FURNITURE FEARS 
IT'S THE FINAL GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
AND BECAUSE YOU CHEATED IN THE LAST PROPERTY WENDY HAS GOT TWO RIGHT 
SO LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN REDEEM YOURSELF O. K. O. K. 
YOU'VE BOTH SEEN THE PROPERTY 
I'M GOING TO LET WENDY GO FIRST WENDY GIVE US A PRICE 
I RECKON ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
INTERESTING ROMANY WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY AND NO PENCE 
O. K. WHO'S TOLD HER 
IT IS UNBELIEVABLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY YOU HAVE BEEN COLLUDING YES 
YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST BUT YOU KEPT YOUR INTEGRITY INTACT SORRY WENDY YES INDEED 
I SAY THAT WENDY IS THE WINNER ON GUESSING 
NO WAY IT WAS TWO TO ONE I SUPPOSE SO 
SO IT'S TIME TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE YOU'D LIKE TO TEST DRIVE 
IT IS A LARGE PURCHASE YOU'RE HOPING TO MAKE SO WE'VE SHOWN YOU A REAL MIX OF BRICKS 
TO HELP YOU MAKE THAT DECISION I HAVE A LAPTOP HERE 
THIS ISN'T FOR INTERNET SHOPPING 
LOOK AT THE PROPERTIES LOOK AT THE PRICES AND MAKE A WELL INFORMED CHOICE 
WHO'S TAKING THIS ME DON'T GIVE IT TO HER 
SHE'S A CHEAT GIRLS DISAPPEAR OFF AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER 
COME ON THEN MY GOODNESS 
WHILE THEY'RE BUYING A PAIR OF SHOES ON THE INTERNET 
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP FOR YOU AT HOME 
PROPERTY ONE MY CHOICE A TWO BEDROOMED APARTMENT AT THE REAR OF THIS LOVELY VICTORIAN BUILDING 
LOTS OF CHARACTER PLENTY OF SPACE 
AND ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
MY CHOICE PROPERTY TWO A MODERN FLAT 
IN THE AWARD WINNING VILLAGE OF KINGSCLERE 
AND THAT ONE'S PRICED AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND FINALLY THE WILD CARD A HOUSE RATHER THAN A FLAT ONE BEDROOM RATHER THAN TWO 
AND THE WILD CARD WILL ALSO SET HER BACK ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE PROPERTIES 
BUT WHICH ONE WILL THEY TEST BEFORE THEY INVEST 
NOW THAT'S PROPERTY ONE THAT'S SUCH A GREAT LOUNGE ISN'T IT 
PROPERTY ONE HAD SUCH A GOOD FEEL TO IT 
YES IT WAS LIKE HOME 
YOU COULD MOVE IN AND LIVE THERE AND IT WAS WORKABLE WASN'T IT 
THE MASTER BEDROOM WAS GREAT 
SUCH A GOOD SIZE 
THE SECOND BEDROOM THOUGH WAS INCEY WASN'T IT 
IT WAS A BIT SMALL AND THE BATHROOM 
THAT WAS PROPERTY TWO WASN'T IT 
I QUITE LIKED THAT ONE 
THAT WAS YOUR LITTLE CASTLE 
IN KINGSCLERE THE KITCHEN WAS ALL RIGHT 
YOU WOULD NEED TO REFIT THAT 
BUT YOU COULD'VE MADE IT A BIT MORE OPEN PLAN INTO THAT SMALL LIVING ROOM 
THE BEDROOM WAS TOO SMALL REALLY WASN'T IT 
IT WAS TINY YOU'D NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIT IT OUT AS A GUEST ROOM 
THE WILD CARD YEAH 
I DID LOVE IT I LOVED IT 
IT'D BE HOME FOR A SINGLE PERSON HAVE YOU GOT YOUR FAVOURITE 
I THINK WE'RE AGREED ON THAT ONE 
YEAH I'VE GOT MINE RIGHT LET'S GO AND TELL THE BOYS O. K. 
AS SOON AS I SAW YOU LADIES I KNEW YOU WERE BOTH SMART YOU'VE GONE FOR MY CHOICE 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT 
I SAY CONTINUE WITH THE NEXT SENTENCE AND DON'T GLOAT 
I'VE GOT NOTHING MORE TO SAY I'M STANDING HERE AND GLOATING GIRLS WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN THIS ONE 
FROM THE INTERESTING SELECTION OF PROPERTIES 
IT'S GOT THE MOST POTENTIAL 
AND SIMON POINTED OUT A FEW THING WE COULD DO TO THE PROPERTY 
AND IT'S THE BEST MATCH FOR MY NEEDS 
YEAH AND THE OTHER PROPERTIES WERE GREAT BUT THIS ONE BY FAR IS MOST SUITED TO WHAT I NEED 
AND YOU LIKE IT I LIKE IT 
I THINK IT'S GOT THE GRAND ENTRANCE IT'S GOT THE HIGH CEILINGS IT'S JUST GOT A REALLY BIG FEEL ABOUT IT 
AND RIGHT IN THE HEART OF NEWBURY EXACTLY 
OUR TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY PROPERTY SURVEYOR HAS LOOKED AT THIS HOUSE 
NOW THIS IS NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY AND WE WOULD ALWAYS IMPLORE YOU 
BEFORE YOU EVER BOUGHT A PROPERTY TO GET A FULL STRUCTURAL SURVEY CARRIED OUT 
SO LET'S SPLIT THESE GIRLS UP 
O. K. COME WITH ME DOWN THE BACK PASSAGE MY GOODNESS 
NOW YOU'RE VERY LUCKY BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR HANDS ON A RATHER LARGE IMPRESSIVE BULGE 
OVER THERE O. K. 
RIGHT HANDS ON THAT WALL 
THIS IS THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE 
UP AND DOWN CAN YOU FEEL IT 
YEAH CAN YOU FEEL THAT BULGE 
O. K. THIS COULD BE A NUMBER OF THINGS 
BUT THE BUILDING HAS FORMED A RATHER INTERESTING SHAPE COMING O. T. HERE 
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 
A LOT OF OLD BUILDINGS SUFFER FROM THIS THERE'S NO CRACKS 
AND YOU SEE THAT BLACK THING THERE IT HAS BEEN PINNED 
THE OTHER THING YOU'VE MANY FLATS IN HERE 
THIS DOESN'T AFFECT THE APARTMENT WE'RE LOOKING AT 
NO SO ALL I WOULD DO IS RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU WERE GOING TO BUY THIS PROPERTY 
THAT WENDY WOULD GET THIS INVESTIGATED FURTHER BUT DON'T BE SCARED OF THE BULGE 
NOW WENDY WITH A PROPERTY OF THIS AGE IF YOU DO DECIDE TO INVEST 
IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE AS SIMPLE AS SAY A NEW BUILD O. K. 
OUR SURVEYOR PARTICULARLY RECOMMENDS YOU GET A FIRE OFFICER IN 
TO CHECK OUT THIS FIRE ESCAPE BECAUSE IT HAS A FEW PROBLEMS 
WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT HAVING A WINDOW AGAINST IT 
AND HAVING THIS PLASTIC ROOF UNDER IT IS A GOOD IDEA 
IT MIGHTN'T MEET TODAY'S REGULATIONS 
AND GET THE WHOLE FIRE ALARM SYSTEM CHECKED OUT 
THAT HASN'T PUT YOU OFF NOT AT ALL THEN ENJOY THE TEST DRIVE GREAT 
HANG ON SHE'S ONLY JUST STARTED THE TEST DRIVE AND WENDY'S LEAVING ALREADY 
THERE WE GO GREAT THANK YOU SEE YOU LATER SEE YOU LATER BYE 
AFTER A FEW MILES PEDALLING HER TRUSTY STEED THE COGS IN WENDY'S HEAD 
ARE TURNING TO SIMON'S IDEA OF SWAPPING AROUND THE ROOMS 
I CAN IMAGINE THIS ROOM BUT I'M BATTLING TO IMAGINE THE KITCHEN AS A BEDROOM I'VE GOT A PLAN 
OH AND WHAT A PLAN 
A BED CUM DINER 
I THINK SOME OF THE COGS ARE COMING LOOSE 
KRISTIAN I HOPE THEY PUT THAT MATTRESS BACK OR WE'RE IN TROUBLE 
I'M SURE THEY DID BUT LOOK AT THIS A BUCKET LOAD OF CHOCOLATE 
IT'S BIG FONDUE SOME FRIENDS AND ROMANY'S FAMILY BRING A STICKY END TO WENDY'S TEST DRIVE 
RIGHT OUR LOVELY SOUTH AFRICANS HAVE YOU ENJOYED THE TEST DRIVE 
DEFINITELY WE DID 
WE'VE TESTED OUT ALL THE ROOMS 
TRIED THE SMALL ROOM AND LOOKED AT IT TO SEE 
HOW THE KITCHEN WOULD FIT IN AND HOW IT WOULD WORK 
WE TESTED THE BEDROOM TO SEE IF THE KITCHEN WOULD FIT IN NOT A LINE YOU HEAR EVERY DAY 
IT'S NOT BUT WENDY HAS THE REQUIRED IMAGINATION FOR THIS APARTMENT 
YES I DO YOU'RE BOTH UNCONVENTIONAL 
I LIKE THAT YOU'RE OPEN MINDED 
THERE'S ONLY ONE BIG QUESTION THAT MATTERS HERE 
ON THE EDGE OF THE SOFA THERE 
I AM LITERALLY ON THE EDGE OF THE SOFA 
ARE YOU GOING TO BARTER OR SCARPER 
I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND I'M AFRAID IT'S A COP OUT I KNOW 
BUT I'M JUST NOT QUITE SURE I CAN'T SAY EITHER AT THE MOMENT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE SHOULD DO 
I THINK WENDY SHOULD BARTER REALLY I DO YOU LIKE IT 
I LOVE IT WELL THAT'S A DONE DEAL EASIER SAID WHEN IT'S NOT YOUR MONEY 
YES I KNOW GIVE ME ANY MONEY WE KNOW ROMANY IS IN CHARGE OF THIS IT'S ALL HERE 
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE INVITES FOR THE HOUSEWARMING UNTIL THEN SEE YOU LATER ON THANK YOU THANK YOU 
YOU KNOW KRISTIAN EVEN THOUGH WENDY SAID SHE WAS UNDECIDED 
I'VE JUST GOT A GUT INSTINCT THAT THIS IS GOING TO TURN INTO A BARTER 
I CONCUR I THINK WENDY'S BEEN SENSIBLE AFTER ALL 
ONLY FOOLS RUSH IN WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD 
AND TALKING OF ANGELS IF YOU WOULD LIKE OUR HELP IN A PROPERTY HUNT 
THEN GET IN TOUCH AND WE'LL HELP YOU FIND YOUR OWN LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN 
HEAVEN ANGELS HEAVEN 
MORE LIKE PURGATORY WORKING WITH YOU COME ON

WE CAN'T USE THAT TAKE CAN WE 
AND IT'S ACTUALLY GOT A PATENT NUMBER THERE AS WELL YES
