ONE THING THAT BECAME APPARENT IN THE FIRST SEASON WAS THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A GLOBAL REACH 
AND SEASON TWO IS NO DIFFERENT 
WITH THE SHOW SPREADING ITS WINGS EVEN FURTHER AROUND THE GLOBE 
INTRODUCING NEW CHARACTERS FROM FAR AND WIDE 
SAVE THE WORLD 
WE DECIDED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON TO EXPAND ON THE IDEA 
THAT THIS WAS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON 
IT WASN'T LIKE IT JUST CAME OUT OF LEFT FIELD 
HIRO CAME FROM JAPAN AND SURESH FROM INDIA 
BUT WE REALLY WANTED TO MORE EMBRACE THAT SORT OF THING 
AT THE START OF SEASON TWO WE INTRODUCED TWO LATINO CHARACTERS 
WHO WERE ON THE RUN AND HAD A MYSTERIOUS AND TERRIFYING POWER 
WHO ARE THEY WHY ARE THEY IN THE STORY WHAT IS HAPPENING 
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE WANTED THE AUDIENCE TO ASK 
A COUPLE TOGETHER THEN OVER YOUR SHOULDER JUST THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE BEING CHASED 
SO WHO ARE THESE TWIN HEROES 
DANIA RAMIREZ HAD ALREADY APPEARED IN ANOTHER HIT T. V. SHOW 
LET'S JUST SAY SHE WAS VERY WELL CONNECTED 
WOKE UP THIS MORNING WENT AND GOT YOURSELF A GUN 
SHE HAD BEEN ON THE SOPRANOS 
SHE WAS ALSO IN X. MEN 
AND WE KNEW OUR WRITERS LOVED THE WORK 
THAT SHE HAD DONE ON THE SOPRANOS WE KNEW OF MANY ROLES 
THAT WERE SIMILAR THAT WERE OUT IN PILOTS 
AND WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO MOVE FAST ON THIS 
SO WE GOT HER IN QUICKLY FOR THE PRODUCERS AND TESTED HER 
AND SHE WON THEM OVER IMMEDIATELY 
I WAS REALLY REALLY LUCKY 
COS THEY THOUGHT OF ME AND ALL I HAD TO DO WAS NOT MESS IT UP 
CASTING SHALIM ORTIZ AS MAYA'S BROTHER ALEJANDRO WAS LESS STRAIGHTFORWARD 
DANIA'S FROM THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC WE SAW HISPANIC ACTORS FROM MEXICO 
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT CULTURE AND IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT ACCENT 
WE TRIED TO BASE A LOT OF IT ON ACTING ABILITY FIRST 
BUT FOR DANIA THE DIALOGUE NEEDED TO BE CORRECT 
THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE 
YOU'RE SOMEBODY'S BROTHER BUT YOU HAVE A COMPETELY DIFFERENT ACCENT 
NOT ONLY DID SHALIM HAVE TO SOUND RIGHT HE HAD TO LOOK THE PART TOO 
DANIA IS SO SPECTACULAR LOOKING 
THAT YOU KNOW WE HAD TO STEP UP 
TO MAKE SURE HER BROTHER WAS EQUALLY GOOD LOOKING 
REALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT DANIA YOU'RE JUST YOU KNOW 
YOUR MOUTH OPENS UP AND YOUR EYEBALLS FALL OUT 
SO WE REALLY NEEDED SOMEONE THAT COULD REASONABLY LOOK LIKE 
THIS EXTRAORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S TWIN 
AND AS SOON AS SHALIM WALKED IN THE MEN WHO LIKE MEN THERE 
WERE SUDDENLY DOING EXACTLY WHAT I WAS DOING TOWARDS DANIA 
IT SEEMED LIKE A PERFECT MATCH 
GOT A BLACK MAGIC WOMAN 
I WANTED TO CREATE A CHARACTER 
WHO HAD VERY DARK POWER 
BUT WAS NOT THEMSELVES DARK 
I LIKED THE TENSION OF THAT 
SHE'S A BLACK MAGIC WOMAN 
SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE A DEVIL OUT OF ME 
THE IDEA WAS TO TRY TO EMBRACE SOMETHING THAT WE HADN'T DONE BEFORE 
WHICH WAS TWINS WHO HAD A VERY SYMPATICO KIND OF POWER 
NOTICE I USED SPANISH FOR THAT 
HUH 
AND A LITTLE KNOWN FACT IS THAT TIM IS A TWIN 
SO THAT HE VERY MUCH UNDERSTOOD THAT COUNTERBALANCE 
BETWEEN TWO CHARACTERS 
IT'S KIND OF LETHAL 
I SEE A RED DOOR AND I WANT IT PAINTED BLACK 
MAYA EMITS LIKE THE PLAGUE PRETTY MUCH 
I WANT IT TO TURN BLACK 
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOT A NAME 
BLACK EYES 
WELL IT'S FUNNY AND WE JOKE ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME 
SOME OF THE CHARACTERS HAVE POWERS THAT ARE VERY EASY TO DO TECHNICALLY 
I'D JOKE WITH GREG GRUNBERG THAT HIS WHOLE POWER IS THIS 
RELATIVELY EASY TO DO WITH NIKI IT'S HARDER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BREAK THROUGH DOORS 
RIP PEOPLE APART 
AND THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGY NEEDED 
CLAIRE HAS A VERY DIFFICULT POWER BECAUSE SHE YOU KNOW GETS RIPPED APART 
THEN WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO DO THAT WITH PROSTHETICS OR WITH C. G. I. 
BUT YOU'D NEVER THINK MAYA'S POWER HER EYES TURN BLACK 
AND SHE CRIES BLACK TEARS WOULD BE SO DIFFICULT 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS JUST THAT WE WOULD PUT THESE BLACK TEARS ON HER EYES 
AND THEY'D DRIP TOO FAR OR THEY WOULD BE SMALLER IN ONE SHOT AND BIGGER IN ANOTHER SHOT 
IT WAS BETTER MOST OF THE TIME TO DO IT AS A C. G. I. EFFECT 
WE WANTED THE TRANSITION TO BE FAST 
AND THEY'RE INTO IT 
AND SO 
WE ULTIMATELY ENDED UP WITH JUST SOMETHING SIMPLE 
WHICH IS THAT THEIR EYES FADE TO BLACK 
AND BECOME VERY SIMILAR TO ISAAC'S EYES IN THE FIRST SEASON 
WHEN HE WAS SEEING THE FUTURE ONLY BLACK 
WHICH WOULD THEN STAIN HER FACE AND NOT BE CONSISTENT FROM TAKE TO TAKE 
THE ACTRESS WE JUST SHE HAD TO CRY 
THAT POOR ACTRESS HAD TO CRY FOR THE WHOLE SEASON 
I CRY I MEAN I'M AN ACTRESS THAT'S ALL WE DO 
YOU HAVE TO CRY YOU CRY 
I'M ALL CRIED OUT 
YOU TOOK A WHOLE LOT OF LOVING 
THE C. G. I. GUYS WOULD CAPTURE HER REAL TEARS AND TURN THEM BLACK 
AND THAT LOOKED VERY REALISTIC IT ENDED UP BEING 
THE BEST AND MOST CONSISTENT EFFECT 
AND IT LOOKS FRIGGIN' COOL 
THE POWER MAY BE COOL BUT THE SCENES NEEDED TO LOOK MUY CALIENTE 
WE WANTED TO MAKE IT LOOK HOT 
AND WE TOOK THESE TWO EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL ACTORS 
AND COVERED THEM IN DIRT AND SWEAT AND THEN ADDED MORE DIRT 
SO DANIA WHO IS JUST RIDICULOUSLY BEAUTIFUL IN REAL LIFE 
WAS JUST CONSTANTLY COVERED WITH SWEAT AND DIRT AND GRIME 
BUT YOU KNOW WE WANTED IT TO BE VERY TEXTURAL 
MAYA AND ALEJANDRO ARE RUNNING AROUND LIKE CRAZY PEOPLE 
MOST OF THE TIME SO YOU KNOW WE HAD TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THEIR WARDROBE WAS APPROPRIATE WITH THE TEMPERATURE 
WHICH WAS REALLY WARM AND WHAT THEY WERE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
I DON'T TAKE A LOT TO GET READY 
COS IF YOU SEE MAYA MOST OF THE TIME 
SHE'S JUST DIRTY 
UH IT WAS REALLY HOT 
REALLY HOT THERE WERE DAYS 
THERE WAS A DAY THAT IT WAS DEFINITELY LIKE ONE HUNDRED FIVE ONE HUNDRED SEVEN DEGREES 
WE WERE ALL DRAGGING 
THE HEAT WAS ON FOR THE HEROES TEAM TO FIND CENTRAL AMERICAN LOCATIONS 
WITHIN TWO HOURS OF DOWNTOWN L. A. 
ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING LOCATIONS FOR SEASON TWO 
WAS THE JOURNEY MAYA AND ALEJANDRO MAKE FROM THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
UP TO THE BORDER AND ON INTO NEW YORK TRYING TO FIND DOCTOR SURESH 
BECAUSE IT COVERS SO MANY DIFFERENT TOPOGRAPHIES 
WHETHER THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE JUNGLE 
AND THEN THEY'RE IN THESE DUSTY KIND OF CENTRAL AMERICAN TOWNS 
AND WE STUMBLED ACROSS A COUPLE OF AREAS OVER IN EAST LOS ANGELES 
THAT WERE REALLY QUITE ASTONISHING 
I'M A NATIVE OF L. A. AND I WAS THRILLED TO FIND THESE PLACES I'D NEVER SEEM 'EM 
THEY WERE QUITE CONVINCING THE WHOLE FOOT CHASE WITH THE POLICE CHASING THEM 
IT REALLY CAME OFF WELL 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME 
COS I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA GET TO MEXICO 
WELCOME TO THE HOTEL CALIFORNIA 
I DROVE MY WIFE CRAZY BECAUSE EVERY TIME I WATCH A MOVIE OR T. V. SHOW AS A LOCATION MANAGER 
YOU AUTOMATICALLY SAY OH THAT'S SO AND SO OR THAT'S HOLLY BOULEVARD 
OR THAT'S AN ALLEY IN SANTA MONICA YOU AUTOMATICALLY 
AND YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH PICK IT OUT OF A MOVIE 
BUT YOU WOULD NEVER GUESS THAT THE LOCATION FOR THE TROPICAL BEACH SCENES 
WAS ACTUALLY THE TRUSTY HEROES STUDIO CAR PARK 
WHERE AM I 
WE'RE IN MAUI 
NICE HUH FEEL THOSE TRADE WINDS 
WHEN WE WERE ON THE BEACH 
THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE MY CHARACTER THIS SEASON 
WAS IN THE PARKING LOT HERE AT THE STUDIO 
WITH A BIG BLUE SCREEN AND SOME SAND IT WAS COOL TO SEE HOW THEY BROUGHT IT TO LIFE 
SO NONE OF THIS IS REAL 
SHOW ME WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE 
HONEY YOU REALLY DON'T WANNA KNOW 
SHOW ME 
WHAT WE ENDED UP DOING FOR THIS PARTICULAR SEQUENCE 
WHICH WE REALLY BROKE DOWN INTO TWO PIECES 
THE PART ON THE BEACH AND THE PART IN THE SHACK 
THEY HAD THE SHACK BUILT NEXT DOOR 
IN A SOUND STAGE 
AH AAH 
I COME STUMBLING OUT OF THE DOOR 
THAT DOOR WAS SO FLIMSY IT KEPT BREAKING 
WE KEPT PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER AFTER EVERY TAKE 
THE ONE WE USED WAS THE LAST TAKE 
COS THE DOOR COMPLETELY OBLITERATES 
GET DOWN GET DOWN 
THERE WAS A LOT OF FOLIAGE FOR THE INSIDE OF A SOUND STAGE 
BUT NOT A JUNGLE'S WORTH 
AND THERE WAS A CAMERA THAT WAS ON A TECHNOCRANE 
AND THEN THE CRANE PULLED BACK AND THEN THEY C. G. I. ED THE REST 
JUNGLE BOOGY 
AH YEAH 
JUNGLE BOOGY 
MY FIRST DAY BACK 
SO WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR SYLAR TO SCUTTLE BACK ONTO OUR SCREENS 
I THINK THE REASON WHY WE DIDN'T REINTRODUCE SYLAR INTO THE STORY UNTIL EPISODE THREE 
IS SO THAT THE FANS'D THINK HE REALLY DIED 
HE LOOKS DEAD 
I'M ALMOST HIT BY A CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 
THAT JUST HAPPENS TO BE GOING BACK TO NEW YORK TO SEE SURESH IT'S PERFECT 
BUT THINGS ARE FAR FROM PERFECT FOR THE NOW POWERLESS SYLAR 
HELP ME 
PETER AND SYLAR WERE BOTH SO POWERFUL AT THE END OF SEASON ONE 
THAT ON A PURELY PRACTICAL LEVEL 
IT SORT OF LED YOU TO A LAND OF BIG GIANT CATACLYSMIC SPECIAL EFFECTS EVERY WEEK 
WHICH WERE UNFEASIBLE FOR US PRACTICALLY 
AND ALSO 
ULTIMATELY NOT THAT INTERESTING BECAUSE AS ALWAYS WE'RE ABOUT CHARACTER 
HE'S FREAKED OUT THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS POWERS 
I CAN'T MAKE IT MOVE 
THAT CUP I USED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THINGS MOVE WITH MY MIND 
WHEN YOU STRIP A VILLAIN OF THEIR POWER 
SOME OF THE BASE NATURE OF WHO THEY ARE STARTS TO SHOW UP 
EVERYTHING THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR EVERYTHING THAT I HAD IT'S GONE 
WE WERE ALWAYS REALLY FASCINATED BY THE GABRIEL GRAY ASPECT OF WHO SYLAR WAS 
AND WE'RE GONNA GET TO KIND OF EXPLORE THAT 
CLEARLY HE'S ON A QUEST TO REGAIN HIS FORMER GLORY 
AND SO THAT'S WHAT VOLUME TWO IS WATCHING THAT SLOW MARCH BACK TO BEING SYLAR 
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME 
IT'S GABRIEL 
OMINOUS ECHO 
WHEN HE CALLS HIMSELF GABRIEL IN THAT EPISODE IT'S WITH UM 
HE REALISES THAT HE'S NOT WHO HE WAS WHO HE BECAME 
WHO HE WANTS TO BE 
GABRIEL GRAY 
YEAH IT'S A SAD MOMENT FOR HIM 
LIKE THE ANGEL 
YEAH 
JUST LIKE THE ANGEL 
I LOVE ZAC HE'S SO SUBTLE IN THE WAY THAT HE DOES IT 
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SO PHYSICAL AS MUCH AS IT IS A LOOK 
IT'S AN AURA 
IT'S SO WEIRD BECAUSE NOT EVERY ACTOR CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT 
CAN GO FROM SMILING WITH THEIR EYES 
TO YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO KILL YOU YOU KNOW 
ALL IN LIKE HALF A SECOND 
I TRY TO BE AWARE OF THAT WHEN I'M IN SCENES I MEAN 
THAT'S SORT OF ANOTHER LEVEL ANOTHER LAYER OF THIS CHARACTER'S PSYCHOLOGY 
WHAT A WICKED GAME TO PLAY 
TO MAKE ME FEEL THIS WAY 
I THINK SHE'S INTRIGUED BY HIM 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING 
I'M GOING HOME TO AMERICA NEW YORK 
NEW YORK 
THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING 
THERE'S SO MUCH HONESTY IN THE WAY THAT HE JUST STARES AT HER 
I KNOW DOCTOR SURESH 
WE'RE OLD FRIENDS YOU AND DOCTOR SURESH 
YOU'VE HELPED ME NOW I CAN RETURN THE FAVOUR I CAN TAKE YOU TO HIM 
I CAN HELP YOU FIND HIM 
SHE LOOKS TO HIM FOR PROTECTION 
GUIDANCE UM 
AND HE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THAT FULLY 
WE DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT ANYONE 
WELL YOU CAN TELL THE POLICE THAT BECAUSE DEREK IS CALLING THEM RIGHT NOW 
NO NO NO PLEASE NO HE CANNOT 
MAYA 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME 
HE BECOMES SORT OF ABSORBED 
INTO THAT RELATIONSHIP IT BECOMES A TRIANGLE 
YOU BOTH 
HAVE POWER 
THIS IS NOT OUR FAULT 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US 
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO FIND DOCTOR SURESH 
YES 
HE CLEARLY FOUND IN BOTH OF THEM A CHANCE TO UM 
IT'S A MEAL TICKET BASICALLY IT'S A RIDE TO WHERE HE WANTS TO GO 
BELIEVE ME I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH 
TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO DO 
BEING HUNTED 
I'VE HELPED SURESH WITH MANY PEOPLE LIKE YOU HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO 
THEY NEED HIM NOW 
BECAUSE HE KNOWS AND HE HAS THE POWER TO RUIN THEM 
SO HE JUST TURNS IT AROUND FOR HIS OWN GAIN 
HELP THE POLICE 
THEY HAVE TO CATCH US FIRST 
DOES MAYA SEE THROUGH SYLAR'S WICKED GAME 
YOUR EYES
