GOOD MORNING THIS IS BREAKFAST 
DIANA THE INQUEST PRINCES WILLIAM 
AND HARRY SAY THEY AGREE WITH THE 
UNLAWFUL KILLING VERDICT MOHAMED 
AL FAYED SAYS HE'S GIS APPOINTED 
DISAPPOINTED 
GOOD MORNING ALSO AHEAD TALKING 
TO THE TAPAS SEVEN POLICE WILL 
QUESTION FRIENDS OF KATE AND GERRY 
MCCANN MCCANN YOUNG PEOPLE USING SUN BEDS 
INCREASE THEIR CHANCES OF CANCER BY 
SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT NO SAVINGS NO MORTGAGE NOW THE 
BIG BANKS STOP OFFERING HOME LOANS 
TO CUSTOMERS WITHOUT SAVINGS 
IN WEATHER A COLD AND FROSTY START 
TO THE DAY WITH SUNSHINE 
DEVELOPING BUT ALSO SOME SHOWERS 
HAVE A LISTEN TO THIS 
BIRD SONG 
THERE IS A DIGITAL RADIO STATION 
THAT CHANGED ITS FORMAT TO PLAY A 
LOOP OF BIRDS IT'S GETTING TWENTY 
MILLION LISTENERS 
PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY SAY THEY 
AGREE WITH THE VERDICTS REACHED BY 
THE JURY AT THE DIANA INQUEST 
THEY BUT DODI'S FATHER MOHAMED AL 
FAYED SAYS HE'S DISAPPOINTED WITH 
THE VERDICT FOR THE INQUEST JURY 
THE EVIDENCE WAS CLEAR PRINCESS 
DIANA AND DODI FAYED WERE 
UNLAWFULLY KILLED BUT NOT THROUGH 
CONSPIRACY THEIR DEATHS WERE 
CAUSED BY THE WRECKLESS ACTIONS OF 
THEIR DRIVER HENRI PAUL AND THE 
PAPARAZZI WHO CHASED THEIR CAR 
THROUGH THE STREETS OF PARIS 
CONCLUSIONS THAT THE PRINCESS'S 
SONS WILLIAM AND HARRY HAVE 
WELCOMED 
FOR MOHAMED AL FAYED THERE'S 
DISAPPOINTMENT HE STILL BELIEVES 
THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY A THEORY 
ONE FORMER ADVISOR SAYS HE WAS 
ENCOURAGED TO BELIEVE 
THE PEOPLE 
AROUND HIM FED WHAT MANY OF US 
VIEWED AS A FANTASY AND I THINK 
THAT THAT IS DEPLORABLE 
BUT IT 
SEEMS FOR MANY OTHERS THE TIME HAS 
COME TO MOVE ON 
I HAVE GREAT 
SYMPATHY WITH AL FAYED L. THINK HE 
LOST HIS SON BUT I THINK IT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN SOONER IT IS A 
TREMENDOUS WASTE OF PUBLIC MONEY 
FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY THINGS 
SHOULD MOVE ON HOW CRAZY AFTER TEN 
YEARS TO STILL BE HARPING BUT 
THERE'S BEEN AN INQUIRY AND 
HOPEFULLY IT'S FINISHED 
MOHAMED AL 
FAYED IS CONSIDERING HIS LEGAL 
OPTIONS BUT IT IS HARD TO SEE WHAT 
THEY MIGHT BE NOW HIS CLAIMS OF 
CONSPIRACY HAVE BEEN DISCREDITED BY 
A JURY 
LET'S TALK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT WHO 
IS AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE GOOD 
MORNING WITH THE PRINCES SAYING 
THEY AGREE WITH THE VERDICT IS IT 
POSSIBLE FOR THEM AND EVERYBODY 
ELSE TO DRAW A LINE UNDER THE 
AFFAIR 
I THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AFFAIR THERE IS ACTUALLY LORD JUSTICE 
SCOTT BAKER SAID HE ALWAYS WANTED 
THESE INQUEST TO ALLAY PUBLIC 
SUSPICION THAT IS WHY THE SCOPE OF 
THEM HAD BEEN SO BROAD WHY WE 
HEARD SO MUCH PERSONAL DETAIL AND 
WHY HE LLOYD THAT RUMOUR AND 
SPECULATION TO BE ADDRESSED DURING 
THE INQUEST SO I THINK TO A 
CERTAIN EXTENT FOR SOME PEOPLE 
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH YOU WILL 
ALWAYS HAVE THOSE WHO JUST BELIEVE 
THERE WAS SOMETHING NOT RIGHT ABOUT 
WHAT WENT ON IN PARIS TEN AND A 
HALF YEARS AGO THOSE WHO STILL 
BELIEVE THERE WAS SOME KIND OF 
CONSPIRACY MOHAMED AL FAYED IS 
DEFINITELY GOING TO BE ONE THAT 
WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT THAT ACCORDING ACCORDING TO THE JURY THE PAPARAZZI IN PARIS 
PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
ACCIDENT ANY CHANCE OF ANY ACTION 
AGAINST THEM 
I THINK THAT IS JUST 
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT'S HARD TO SEE 
HOW YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO THAT ALSO 
BECAUSE NONE OF THEM WERE NAMED AS 
INDIVIDUALS BUT THE MINISTRY OF 
JUSTICE HAS ALSO SAID THAT HERE IN 
THE U. K. THAT IT HAS NO POWER TO 
CHARGE FOREIGN NATIONALS WITH AN 
ALLEGED CRIME CARRIED OUT ON 
FOREIGN SOIL THAT JUST DOESN'T 
COME WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION SO IT 
IS REALLY HARD TO SEE WHERE YOU CAN 
GO FROM HERE MOHAMED AL FAYED HAS 
HAS SAID THAT HE HAS BEEN LOOKING 
OVERNIGHT AT THE VERDICTS SEEING 
IF THERE IS ANY WAY OF ANY LEGAL 
REDRESS FOR HIM BUT EVEN HIS TEAM 
HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT THERE IS NOW 
PROBABLY VERY FEW OPTIONS IN TERMS 
FOR THEM LEGALLY 
AFTER SEVEN HUNDRED WE WILL BE TALKING TO 
MR. MOHAMED AL FAYED'S SPOKE WOMAN 
AND THE PUBLICIST MAX CLIFFORD WHO 
USED TO WORK FOR HIM FRIENDS WHO 
DINED WITH KATE AND GERRY MCCANN ON 
THE NIGHT THEIR DAUGHTER 
DISAPPEARED WILL BE QUESTIONED BY 
LEICESTERSHIRE POLICE TODAY THE 
GROUP WILL BE INTERVIEWED IN THE 
PRESENCE OF PORTUGUESE DETECTIVES 
UNDER SCRUTINY ONCE AGAIN THE 
SEVEN FRIENDS WHO WERE WITH KATE 
AND GERRY MCCANN WHEN MADELINE 
VANNISHED WITH FACE MORE QUESTIONS 
FROM POLICE TODAY ABOUT THE EVENTS 
OF THAT NIGHT ELEVEN MONTHS AGO THEY 
ARE LIKELY TO BE INTERVIEWED HERE 
AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF 
LEICESTERSHIRE POLICE AND WATCHING 
WILL BE PORTUGUESE DETECTIVES WHO 
FLEW INTO THE U. K. YESTERDAY NONE 
ARE EXPECTED TO BRING LAWYERS WITH 
THEM THEY ARE BEING QUESTIONED 
SIMPLY AS WITNESSES 
KATE AND GERRY MCCANN ARE NOT BEING 
QUESTIONED THEY ARE STILL FORMAL 
SUSPECTS IN THIS INVESTIGATION AND 
EACH OF THE SO CALLED TAPAS SEVEN 
ARE ON LIST OF PEOPLE COMPILED BY 
THE COUPLE WHO CAN SUPPORT THE CASE 
THAT THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 
THEIR DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE 
MADELINE'S PARENTS WILL BE OUT OF 
THE COUNTRY FOR MOST OF THE VISIT 
BY THE PORTUGUESE AUTHORITIES 
THOUGH THEIR SPOKESMAN SAYS THEY 
WELCOME THE REINTERVIEWING OF THEIR 
FRIENDS FRIENDS DETECTIVES INVESTIGATING THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF NINE YEAR OLD 
SHANNON MATTHEWS ARE CONTINUING TO 
QUESTION HER MOTHER MOTHER KAREN 
SHE HAS BEEN ARRESTED ON SUSPICION 
OF PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
SHANNON WAS DISCOVERED IN A HOUSE 
NOT FAR FROM HER HOME TWENTY FOUR DAYS 
AFTER SHE WENT MISSING 
HILLARY CLINTON HAS CALLED ON 
PRESIDENT BUSH TO BOYCOTT THE 
OPENING CEREMONY OF THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES UNLESS CHINA IMPROVES ITS 
HUMAN RIGHTS THREE PEOPLE SCALED 
THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE IN SAN 
FRANCISCO TO HANG THE TIBETAN FLAG 
AND TWO BANNERS AS PARTS OF A 
PROTEST THERE THE FLAME IS DUE TO 
ARRIVE IN THE CITY LATER TODAY 
IT'S KNOWN AS THE RETIREMENT CLIFF 
EDGE WHEN PEOPLE SUDDENLY STOP 
WORKING NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS 
URGING PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT GIVING 
UP WORK GRADUALLY HALF OF 
PENSIONERS FELT UNHAPPY ON THEIR 
FIRST DAY OF RETIREMENT THE 
GOVERNMENT BELIEVES PEOPLE LIKE 
AGAIN ARE SETTING AN EXAMPLE WHEN 
THEY RETIRE NOW AGED SEVENTY THREE SHE STILL 
DOES PART TIME OFFICE WORK AND 
FINDS IT ESSENTIAL TO HER WELL 
BEING 
IT KEEPS MY MIND GOING IT BEING GIVES ME SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK 
ABOUT BUT MYSELF AND GIVES ME A 
DIFFERENT ASPECT ON ALL SORTS OF 
THINGS 
THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO THINGS STAY AT WORK APART FROM MONEY 
ACCORDING TO A SURVEY SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT OF 
PEOPLE SAID THEY WOULD MISS WORK 
COLLEAGUES COLLEAGUES ONLY SEVENTEEN PER CENT SAID THEY WOULD MISS THE 
OFFICE PARTY AND ONLY NINE PER CENT THE 
CANTEEN GROUNDS PERHAPS FOR A 
GRADUAL RETIREMENT 
WHAT PEOPLE ARE 
REALLY PROBABLY WELL ADVISED TO 
THINK ABOUT IS WHETHER THEY WANT TO 
EASE THEM SELF IN IN STEPS 
WHETHER BY PERHAPS TAKING A STEP 
DOWN CONTINUING TO WORK FULL TIME 
BUT DOING A LESS DEMANDING JOB OR 
GOING PART TIME OR PERHAPS 
CONSIDERING SOME VOLUNTEERING 
BUT AGE CONCERN IS ALSO ACCUSING 
THE GOVERNMENT OF DOUBLE STANDARDS 
EVEN THOUGH THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORK 
AND PENSIONS SAYS EMPLOYERS SHOULD 
HELP THEIR STAFF TO RETIRE 
GRADUALLY WORKERS CAN STILL BE 
FORCED TO GO WHEN THEY REACH THEIR 
SIXTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY 
FIRST TIME BUYERS AND KEY WORKERS 
ARE TO BE OFFERED GRANTS OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED 
IF THEY PURCHASE A PROPERTY UNDER 
SHARED OWNERSHIP SCHEME GORDON 
BROWN WILL SAY HE WANTS TO HELP 
PEOPLE WHO NEED AN EXTRA HAND TO 
ENTER THE HOUSING MARKET THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO NAME THE SITES 
WHERE THIRTY THOUSAND NEW HOMES ARE TO BE 
BUILT ACROSS ENGLAND 
A TEENAGER HAS BEEN KILLED IN A 
SHARK ATTACK OFF THE THE COAST OF 
NEW SOUTH WALES IN AUSTRALIA THE 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WAS SURFING WHEN THE 
SHARK BIT HIS UPPER LEG AND BODY 
BEACHES IN THE AREA WERE CLOSED TO 
SWIMMERS AFTER THE ATTACK BUT THE 
SEARCH FOR THE SHARK HAS BEEN 
ABANDONED DUE TO POOR VISIBILITY A 
CONTROVERSIAL CULL OF BADGERS IN 
WALES COULD GET THE GO AHEAD TODAY 
THE WELSH ASSEMBLY IS LIKELY TO 
SUPPORT THE MOVE AS WAY OF 
CONTROLLING THE THE SPREAD OF T. B. IN 
CATTLE ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS SAY 
THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE 
THAT BADGERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
SPREADING THE DISEASE KNOWN TO 
MANY AS THE MID WALES BADGERMAN 
GARETH MORGAN HAS WATCHED AND 
GAINED THE TRUST OF THESE COMPLEX 
ANIMALS FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS 
THEY ARE DOING HERE WHAT THEY HAVE 
BEEN DOING FOR THOUSANDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF YEARS ALL THEY ARE 
DOING IS GOING ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE 
ALWAYS DONE LET'S HOPE WE NEVER 
LOSE THEM 
FOR YEARS BADGERS HAVE 
RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY BEEN BLAMED FOR 
SPREADING TUBERCULOSIS AMONGST 
CATTLE FARMERS HAVE LONG CALLED 
FOR A WIDESPREAD CULL AND IN WALES 
THE ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO 
ANNOUNCE ITS NEXT MOVE IT IS 
THOUGHT THERE ARE JUST LESS THAN A 
MILLION BADGERS LIVING IN SETS LIKE 
THIS THROUGHOUT THE U. K. EVEN THOUGH 
WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THEM OR THEIR 
HABITAT ANY DECISION TO ERADICATE 
LARGE NUMBERS OF BADGERS WOULD BE 
HUGELY UNPOPULAR WITH THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC BADGER GROUPS WANT MORE 
CATTLE TO BE TESTED TO ESTABLISH 
EXACTLY WHERE THE T. B. INFECTION 
COMES FROM FARMERS AND MANY VETS 
SAY BADGER NUMBERS MUST BE KEPT 
DOWN 
AS FAST AS WE ARE FESTING THE DOWN CATTLE AND REMOVING THEMING FROM 
THE EQUATION MORE CATTLE THEN GET 
INFECTED THROUGH THE BADGERS 
COMPENSATING WELSH FARMERS FOR T. B. 
INFECTED CATTLE COST FIFTEEN MILLION 
LAST YEAR EVERYONE AGREES IT IS A 
DISEASE THAT MUST BE KEPT UNDER 
CONTROL BUT IS ERADICATING BADGERS 
THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT IT 
WE ARE THROWING AWAY AN ASTONISHING 
NUMBER OF APPLES FORTY FOUR MILLION OF 
THEM AND SIXTEEN MILLION BANANAS EVERY 
DAY A SURVEY SHOWS BRITISH 
FAMILIES BIN A THIRD OF ALL THE 
FOOD THEY BUY FORTY PER CENT OF IT IS FRUIT 
AND VEGETABLES WASTE EXPERTS 
RECKON THE VALUE OF THAT IS THREE 
BILLION BILLION THAT IS AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF 
APPLES WHY DO PEOPLE THROW AWAY 
APPLES APPLES HERE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS FRESH NOT 
GREEN AND SHINY BUT THE RIGHT 
COLOUR 
SLIGHTLY BRUISED EVERY NOW COLOUR AND AGAIN 
GOOD MORNING IT IS ALL OR NOTHING

SAD STORY FROM THE DAILY MAIL 
TRIRB SHAH GODDARD HAS ANNOUNCED

CONTINUE WITH HER WORK 
IN NUNEATON THERE IS A VERY NAUGHTY 
PARROT CALLED BARN ANY HE SWARES

TEACHING THE OTHER PARROTS TO SWEAR 
AS WELL THREE YEARS AGO HE WAS 
VERY NAUGHTY AND TOLD THE LOCAL 
MAYOR DURING A CIVIC VISIT TO GO

ALSO TERRIBLY RUDE TO THE VICAR 
THE MAN WHO LOOKS AFTER HIM SAYS 
WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET HIM 
TO CURB HIS LANGUAGE THEY SPEND 
ALL DAY SWEARING AT EACH OTHER 
THAT WAS FROM THE DAILY MAIL 
AND HE IS TWO SQUAKS AWAY FROM 
BEING A BUSINESS PRESENTER NOT

CALLING FOR A CUT IN INTEREST RATES 
THEY ARE WARNING JOBS COULD BE LOST 
WHEN SPENDING SLOWS DOWN AND A LOT 
OF CONFERENCE IN THE INDEPENDENT OF 
THE SALE IN THE GOVERNMENT'S STAKE 
IN BRITISH ENERGY THIS COULD MEAN 
THAT THE NUCLEAR COMPANY ENDS UP 
BEING PART OWNED BY BIG FOREIGN 
ENERGY COMPANIES LIKE E. D. F. THE 
OTHER BUSINESS NEWS FOR YOU WELL 
LOOK AT THIS SHARES IN LONDON

TAKE ON HOUSE PRICES AT EIGHT HUNDRED TODAY 
B. T. THE PHONE COMPANY HAS COME 
BOTTOM OF A SURVEY OF CUSTOMER 
SATISFACTION SURVEYS COMMISSIONED

THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS THE DISK WAS 
BEING DELIVERED BY A COURIER 
COMPANY WHEN IT WENT MISSING H. S. B. C.

INQUEST BUT MOHAMED AL FAYED SAYS

TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM AT ALL SO 
AS WE HAVE A LOOK AT THE RADAR YOU 
WILL SEE THERE HAVE BEEN SHOWERS 
OVERNIGHT AND RAIN NOW SPILLING IN 
ACROSS THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND

CONTINUE ITS JOURNEY MOVING SOUTH 
INTO THE CENTRAL LOWLANDS FRINGING 
INTO NORTHERN IRELAND AND HEADING 
INTO THE SOUTHERN UPLANDS FOR THE 
REST OF US THERE WILL BE GOOD 
SUNNY INTERVALS BUT FURTHER 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING THROUGH THE 
COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON ONE OR TWO 
WHICH MAY BE HEAVY THROUGH THE 
EVENING THEY WILL DIE AWAY THE 
BAND OF RAIN WILL PUSH STEADILY 
SOUTHWARDS BUT RATHER LIKE THE 
NIGHT JUST GONE WE WILL ONCE AGAIN 
HAVE FROST AROUND TEMPERATURES 
DIPPING TO FREEZING IN GLASGOW AND 
TO THREE IN LONDONFUL TOMORROW 
WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE CLEARANCE IN 
THE SKY OVERNIGHT IS WHERE WE WILL

SCOTLAND PREDOMINANTLY OVER THE 
HILLS STILL SOME SNOW BUT 
GENERALLY SPEAKING TEMPERATURES ON 
THE UP SEVEN DEGREES IN LERWICK 
TO A HIGH OF FOURTEEN IN LONDON 
THE OUTLOOK REMAINS UNSETTLED THE 
RISK OF WINTRY SHOWERS FEWER BUT 
STILL THERE TEMPERATURES STILL A 
BIT DISAPPOINTING FOR THE TIME OF 
THE YEAR 
HOW ARE YOU BIRDS DOING OUT THERE 
THIS MORNING 
PRETTY WELL CAN YOU HEAR THEM 
CHIRPING AWAY LIKE NOBODY'S 
BUSINESS IN THE BACKGROUND THEY 
ARE VERY HAPPY THESE BIRDS WELL 
THEY HAVE SNOW WHITE WITH THEM OUT 
THERE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE 
OUR OWN BIRDS 
EXACTLY BECAUSE THERE IS A RADIO 
STATION WHICH CHANGED ITS FORMER AT 
TO PUT ON A LOOP OF BIRDSONG IT 
PLAYS ALL DAY AND IS GETTING LOTS 
AND LOTS OF LISTENING 
CAN WE LISTEN 
CAN YOU HEAR THAT APPARENTLY IT IS 
SOOTHING PEOPLE LISTENING TO IT 
WELL THEY CAN'T BUT THEY TUNE IN 
AND IT CALMS THEM DOWN IF YOU LIVE 
IN THE CITY AND YOU DON'T HEAR MUCH 
IT IS NICE WE WILL BE TALKING TO 
CHRIS THE BLUE PETER GARDENER AT 
EIGHT FORTY A M. L. WOULD LIKE TO HEAR SURF WAVES WAVES I'M SURE THERE IS A RADIO STATION 
FOR YOU SOMEWHERE 
THERE ARE FRESH WARNINGS THAT YOUNG 
PEOPLE WHO USE SUNBEDS ARE GREATLY 
INCREASING THEIR RISK OF DEVELOPING 
SUN CANCER ALISON HARPER IS AT A 
TANNING CENTRE IN WINCHESTER TO 
TELL US MORE GOOD MORNING 
IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE TO 
ANY OF US THAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD 
THAT TANNING CAN CAUSE SKIN DAMAGE 
AND THERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THIS BUT THE LATEST INFORMATION 
FROM CANCER RESEARCH U. K. SUGGESTS 
THAT EIGHTY TWO PER CENT OF PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF 
THIRTY FIVE HAVE USED A SUNBED AT SOME POINT 
IN THEIR LIVES AND BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE DONE SO THEY INCREASE THEIR 
RISK OF DEVELOPING SKIN CANCER 
APPARENTLY BY SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT WELL WE ARE A 
NATION OBSESSED BY HAVING A TAN 
ONE IN THREE WOMEN AND ONE IN FOUR 
MEN HAVE AT SOME POINT USED A 
SUNBED IN A MOMENT WE WILL SPEAK 
TO THE OWNER OF THIS SUNBED SALON 
IN WINCHESTER WHO ACTS RESPONSIBLY 
AND SAYS HE HAS A DUTY TO CARE FOR 
HIS CUSTOMER BUT LET'S HEAR FROM 
ONE USER WHO REGULARLY GOES UNDER 
THE RAYS 
I HAVE USED THEM SINCE I 
WAS SIXTEEN 
I LOVE GOING ON SUNBEDS BECAUSE YOU 
GET A NATURAL TAN AND THERE IS 
NOTHING BET THAN A TAN BECAUSE IT 
MAKES YOU LOOK HEALTHY L. THINK 
EVERYONE WANTS TO LOOK HEALTHY IF 
I'M FEELING PASTEY I WILL GO ON 
THEM TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK 
REALISTICALLY I SHOULD GO ONCE A 
WEEK I WILL GO FOR ABOUT FIVE OR 
SIX MINUTES THAT'S USUALLY ENOUGH 
I THINK ANY SUNBED IS DANGEROUS 
BUT IT IS THE PRICE WE PAY TO LOOK 
HEALTHY AND TANNED L. L. REMEMBER WHEN 
I WAS SIXTEEN I DID GO ON FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE 
MINUTES NOW IT IS MORE MONITORED 
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE IN THEIR TEENS 
THEY DON'T JUST PUT LOADS OF TOKENS 
IN THE MACHINE AND THEY ARE ON THE 
SUNBED RISKING THEMSELVES NOW IT 
IS A LOT BETTER THIS SALON ARE 
VERY GOOD THE BEDS ARE MONITORED 
AND THEY KEEP A RECORD OF HOW OFTEN 
YOU ARE ON THE BED IF SOMEONE SAYS 
THEY WANT FIFTEEN MINUTES THEY WILL SO 
NO SEVEN MINUTES FOR YOUR SKIN 
WELL THERE ARE OF COURSE 
ALTERNATIVES TO USING SUNBEDS HERE 
AT THIS SALON YOU CAN USE SPRAYS AS 
WELL SWAPPING RAYS FOR SPRAYS 
WITH ME IS LINDSAY SHELDON THE 
OWNER YOU FEEL YOU HAVE A 
RESPONSIBLE TOWARDS CUSTOMERS AND 
YOU ARE CAREFUL ABOUT THE DETAILS 
YOU TAKE 
THAT'S CORRECT WE FEEL 
AS WELL AS PROVIDING A COSMETIC 
ENHANCEMENT THAT ANY USE OF SUNBEDS 
THERE NEEDS TO BE A DUTY OF CARE TO 
OUR CLIENTS THAT'S THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING AND UNREGULATED USE 
OF SUNBEDS COULD CAUSE DANGER AND 
COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO SKIN SO WE 
ENSURE THAT OUR CLIENTS TAN IN A 
RESPONSIBLE SAFE WAY AS WELL AS 
FUN 
IF SOMEONE LIKE ME COMES INTO FUN YOUR SALON I HAVE RED HAIR AND 
FRECKLES AND DENT TAN EASILY WHAT 
WOULD YOU SAY 
THERE IS AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO U. V. TANNING WE 
PROVIDE A SPRAY TANNING WE CAN 
KATEER FOR ANYBODY WHETHER IT IS 
THROUGH SAFE USE OF U. V. OR COSMETIC 
SPRAY TANNING 
HERE YOU FOLLOW THE 
SUNBED ASSOCIATION'S CODE OF 
PRACTICE WHICH IS VOLUNTARY BUT I 
KNOW THAT IN SCOTLAND THEY ARE 
THINKING OF PASSING LEGISLATION TO 
REGULATE SALS WHAT DO YOU FEEL 
REGULATE SALONS WHAT DUE FEEL 
ABOUT THAT 
WE WOULD BROADLY 
WELCOME LEGISLATION YOU HAVE TO BE 
CAREFUL THAT NOTHING TOO DRACONIAN 
GETS PASSED BUT IT IS IMPORTANT I 
FEEL THAT PEOPLE CAN COME IN AND 
FEEL SAFE ABOUT THEIR TANNING AT 
THE MOMENT THEY CAN FEEL SAFE 
WITHIN MY SALEN BECAUSE WE WORK 
WITHIN INDUSTRY GUIDELINES BUT 
THERE ARE A LOT OF SALONS THAT 
DON'T HAVE A MEMBER OF STAFF TO 
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T OVERTAN 
THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES THERE ARE 
BRONZERS AND THINGS THIS IS A 
DEBATE GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS AS 
I SAID WHEN I STARTED IT IS NO 
SURPRISE THAT SUN DAMAGE WHETHER 
IT IS BY RAYS OR BY THE SUN DOES 
DAMAGE YOUR SKIN 
COMING UP LATER FROM BAD SERVICE 
TO GOOD SERVERS THE COMPUTER RUN 
RESTAURANT THE ONLY TIP YOU NEED 
IS DON'T FORGET TO PLUG IT IN 
I'M NOT VERY COMPUTER LITERATE IF 
IT RUNS OUT OF SOMETHING YOU KNOW 
WHAT IT SAYS COMPUTER SAYS NO

FAVOURITE FOR THE TITLE OF THE 
MASTERS WITH MANY BELIEVING HE 
COULD WIN ALL FOUR TITLES THIS YEAR 
THERE HASN'T BEEN A EUROPEAN WINNER 
OF THE MASTERS FOR NEARLY TEN YEARS 
LEE WESTWOOD 
DONALD AND 
JUSTIN ROSE WILL BE HOPING TO 
CHANGE ALL THAT 
SOME OF THE STORIES MAKING THE BACK 
PAGES THIS IS THE SPORTING SECTION 
OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THERE ALL 
OR NOTHING 
IN THE DAILY MAIL A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SAYING ARSENE WENGER HAS SAID THEY 
COULD STILL WIN THE DOUBLE IT IS 
AN EXTRAORDINARY CLAIM BEARING IN 
MIND THEIR POOR SEASON SO FAR THE 
TIMES I STILL BELIEVE WE CAN WIN 
THE DOUBLE SAYS ARSENE WENGER 
JUSTIN ROSE GETTING READY FOR THE 
MASTERS THAT MANY SAY HE IS THE TOP 
EUROPEAN CANDIDATE TO WIN THE FIRST 
MAJOR OF THE SEASON THIS TIME LAST 
YEAR I WAS OUT THERE IN THE 
SUNSHINE ENJOYING AUGUSTA NOW BILL 
TURNBULL'S PAY RISE HAS PUT WHAT WHAT AN ALLEGATION 
AFTER THE VERDICT OF THE JURY AT 
THE INQUEST THE PRINCES WILLIAM AND 
HARRY REPORTEDLY HOPING YESTERDAY'S 
VERDICT WILL END ALL THE 
SPECULATION OVER THE DEATH OF THEIR 
MOTHER BUT MOHAMED AL FAYED HAS 
EXPRESSED HIS DISAPPOINT LET'S 
TALK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT 
THE PRENSS MUST HOPE THIS VERDICT 
WILL DRAW A LINE UNDER WHAT 
HAPPENED 
IT WAS INTERESTING HAPPENED READING THE WORDING OF THE 
STATEMENT THEY RELEASED PRETTY LATE 
LAST NIGHT THEY DIDN'T SAY IT 
EXPLICITLY BUT YOU GOT FROM THE 
TONE THAT THEY DID JUST WANT THE 
WHOLE THING TO END HERE THEY DO 
WANT THIS INQUEST TO HAVE BEEN A 
LINE UNDER ALL OF THE RUMOUR AND 
SPECULATION SURROUNDING THEIR 
MOTHER'S DEATH THEY ENDED THE 
STATEMENT BY THANKING ALL ALL OF 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO THEY SAY HAD 
FOUGHT SO HARD THAT NIGHT TO SAVE 
THEIR MOTHER REALLY IT WAS A VERY 
POIGNANT REMINDER OF THE PERSONAL 
TRAGEDY AND HUMAN COST HERE IN THAT 
STATEMENT FROM WILLIAM AND HARRY 
THE VERDICT MENTIONS THE PAPARAZZI 
WHAT ABOUT ANY CHANCE OF LEGAL 
ACTION AGAINST THEM 
I THINK IT IS 
JUST VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE REALLY 
NONE OF THE PAPARAZZI WERE NAMED AS 
INDIVIDUALS IN THAT VERDICT THEY 
WERE JUST DEALT WITH AS A GROUP 
FIRST AND FOREMOST AND THE MINISTRY 
OF JUSTICE HAS ALSO SAID THAT IN 
TERMS OF ANY KIND OF PROSECUTION 
THAT THEY CANNOT LAUNCH A 
PROSECUTION ON FOREIGN NATIONALS 
ACCUSED OF AN ALLEGED CRIME 
COMMITTED ON FOREIGN SOIL SO THEY 
ARE REALLY POWERLESS TO DO ANYTHING 
LEGALLY IN TERMS OF MOHAMED AL 
FAYED AND THE LEGAL PROCESS EVEN 
HE HAS HAD TO SAY VIA HIS TEAM THAT 
HE DOESN'T REALLY THINK THERE'S 
ANYWHERE HE CAN GO EITHER HE HAS 
BEEN LOOKING AT THE VERDICT AND 
TALKING TO HIS LAWYERS TO SEE IF HE 
HAS ANY LEGAL REDRESS BUT EVEN 
THEY SAY NOW THERE PROBABLY IS 
NOWHERE FOR THEM TO GO 
WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO MOHAMED AL 
FAYED'S SPOKESWOMAN HERE ON 
BREAKFAST LATER IN THE PROGRAMME 
IT'S' MOMENT THAT MANY OF US DREAM 
OF WAKING UP ON THE FIRST DAY OF 
RETIREMENT BUT THE REALITY CAN BE 
DIFFERENT A NEW SAUR VAI FOUND 
THAT FIFTY PER CENT OF PENSIONERS WERE UNHAPPY 
AT GIVING UP WORK NOW THE 
GOVERNMENT IS URGING PEOPLE TO NOT 
TO STOP WORKING GRADUALLY 
UNBELIEVABLY YOU ARE PAST 
RETIREMENT AGE FOR WOMEN 
I AM 
NEARLY TWO YEARS PAST THE BUS PASS 
DO YOU FEEL TEMPTED 
I AM VERY 
LUCKY IN THAT I GET PAID FOR DOING 
WHAT I ENJOY DOING A LOT OF PEOPLE 
DON'T YOU CAN IMAGINE WHEN PEOPLE 
WHEN THEY RETIRE WOULD THINK A 
WHOLE LIFETIME OF WEEKENDS BUT THE 
TROUBLE IS WORK CREATES A SKELETON 
FOR YOUR LIFE IT IS A STRUCTURE 
THROUGH IT YOU HAVE YOUR SOCIAL 
LIFE YOU HAVE ALL THE INTERACTIVE 
GOSSIP YOU HAVE A STATUS YOU HAVE 
A POSITION YOU BELONG SOMEWHERE 
WHEN THAT STOPS THAT'S ALL GONE 
IT'S NO GOOD GOING BACK AND MEETING 
PEOPLE AT THE OFFICE BECAUSE THE 
PARADE HAS MOVED ON YOU ARE NO 
LONGER PART OF THE JOKES YOU ARE 
NOT RELEVANT ANY MORE L. THINK WHEN 
PEOPLE FEEL THEY CAN'T CONTRIBUTE 
THAT THEY DON'T BELONG THAT CAN BE 
A VERY DEPRESSING THING L. DON'T 
THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE REALISE THAT 
THEY THINK HL DAYS AND IT'S NOT 
THAT 
INTERESTING WHAT YOU SAY THAT ABOUT THE NOT RELEVANT THAT HAS TO 
BE DEVASTATING IF YOU HAVE BEEN 
REALLY IMPORTANT ALL YOUR LIFE AND 
SUDDENLY NOT RELEVANT IT'S GOT TO 
BE DIFFICULT 
ABSOLUTELY IT 
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A HIGH POWERED 
JOB IT JUST HAS TO BE YOUR JOB 
THE LOCAL DUSTBINMEN YOU GET TO 
KNOW WHEN YOU WORK FROM HOME AS I 
DO I HAVE BEEN LUCKY I HAVE BEEN 
PREPARING FOR MY RETIREMENT FOR TWENTY 
YEARS SINCE I WENT FREELANCE WHEN 
I FIRST WENT FREELANCE I FELT LIKE 
A BALLOON THAT SOMEBODY HAD LET GO 
IN THE STRING YOU FORM A STRUCTURE 
THE WHOLE POINT IS TO FORM A 
STRUCTURE OF YOUR OWN THE GET TO 
KNOW THE BINMEN AND OLD DAVE 
RETIRED AND A MONTH LATER HE WAS 
BACK HE WAS JUST GOING ALONG FOR 
THE RIDE HE WANT THE TO BE BACK 
AND PART OF IT HE WASN'T GETTING 
PAID FOR IT 
IS THERE SOMETHING 
BEHIND THIS IN THE SENSE THE 
GOVERNMENT IS ADVISING US TO GET 
READY FOR RETIREMENT GRADUALLY AND 
IT IS SAYING TO US YOU ARE GCK TO 
HAVE TO WORK LONGER BEFORE YOU CAN 
RETIRE 
YES THE RETIREMENT AGE FOR RETIRE WOMEN IS BEING PHASED UP TO SIXTY FIVE THE 
POINT BEING THAT SOUNDS CRUEL AND 
DRACONIAN BUT I FEEL AS FIT AND 
HEALTHY AS I DID TWENTY YEARS AGO SIXTY SIXTY IS THE NEW FORTY 
ABSOLUTELY L. FEEL 
AS FULL OF BEANS AND ENERGY AS I 
ALWAYS HAVE DONE RETIREMENT IS 
DEMRETLY IRRELEVANT TO ME 
COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT TO ME IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT LOOMS LARGE IN 
PEOPLE'S LIVES IT IS NOT 
NECESSARILY TO DO WITH MONEY A LOT 
OF PEOPLE GO ON WORKING BECAUSE 
THEY NEED THE MONEY BUT IF YOU 
LOOK AT LOTTO WINNERS THERE WAS A 
CASE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ABOUT 
THE GUY WHO WORK INDEED A CHIP SHOP 
AND WHO WON ONE POINT NINE MILLION AND A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER HE WAS BACK 
AT WORK HE SAID THAT'S WHAT I DO 
AND I DO IT WELL PEOPLE NEED THAT 
AFFIRMATION THAT THEY CAN DO 
SOMETHING AND BE RECOGNISED L. L. 
THINK IT'S NOTE ALL SILVER SURFERS 
GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD AND HAVING 
ADVENTURES BUT YOU SHOULD PLAN 
ADVENTURES PLAN IT LIKE A MILITARY 
CAMPAIGN 
THIS IS BREAKFAST FROM B. B. C. NEWS

TOP OF THE CHARTS AS ONE RADIO 
STATION HAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LISTENERS 
TUNING INTO THE SOOTHING SOUNDS 
EVERY DAY 
IT BROADCASTS NOTHING BUT BIRDSONG 
FROM SIX HUNDRED A M. UNTIL MIDNIGHT BUT 
IT'S BECOME IT'S SURPRISE HIT OF 
THE DIGITAL RADIO WORLD 
TWO YEAR OLD NATALIA AND HER TWIN 
BROTHER THOMAS ARE HUGE FANS 
WHEN WE TURN IT ON THEY GIVE A BIG 
CHORUS OF BIRDIES AND THEN KIND 
OF GET BACK TO EATING AND THROWING 
FOOD AROUND THEY ASK FOR IT EVERY 
MORNING THEY KNOW IT IS THERE THE THE RECORDING WAS MADE ALMOST TWENTY YEARS 
AGO BY QUENTIN HOWARD IN HIS BACK 
GARDEN IN WILTSHIRE TODAY HE IS 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF A NUMBER OF 
RADIO STATIONS WHEN ONE OF THEM 
WENT BUST HE DECIDED TO PUT OUT 
THE BIRDSONG INSTEAD 
OH PEOPLE 
LIKE IT THEY LOVE IT IN FACT THEY 
WRITE TO US AND TELL US THEY PUT IT 
ON THE RADIO AND LEAVE IT ON ALL 
DAY LONG WE HAVE LETTERS FROM 
PRISONERS IN JAIL WHO CAN'T HEAR 
THE BIRDSONG BUT THEY CAN NOW WITH 
THE RADIO ON ALL DAY LONG

BUT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MESMERISED 
BY TO SAY THE APPEAL IS OBVIOUS 
I'M SURE PEOPLE REMEMBER THE TIMES 
WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN IN WOODLANDS OR 
THE COUNTRYSIDE LISTENING TO A 
FANTASTIC ARRAY OF BIRDSONG IT 
MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD AND REMINDS 
THEM OF SPRING AND SUMMER THEIR 
PAST IT IS A FANTASTIC THING BUT BUT EVEN THOUGH THE BIRDSONG CHANNEL 
HAS SENT THE LISTENING PUBLIC ALL 
OF A TWITTER IT COULD SOON BE 
HAVING ITS WINGS CLIPPED WHY WELL 
IT IS NOT MAKEK ANY MONEY AND 
HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE TUNE IN AND 
THERE ARE RECKON TO BE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND A 
WEEK WITH NO ADVERTISING REVENUE 
IT WON'T LAST THE BIRDSONG CHANNEL

HARRY SAY THEY AGREE WITH THE 
VERDICT OF UNLAWFUL KILLING 
MOHAMED AL FAYED SAYS HE IS 
DISAPPOINTED DISAPPOINTED WE WILL TALK TO HIS SPOKESWOMAN AT 
SEVEN POINT ONE OH 
GOOD MORNING 
ALSO AHEAD INTERVIEWING THE TAPAS 
SEVEN OFFICERS WILL TODAY QUESTION 
FRIENDS OF KATE AND GERRY MCCANN 
THE LATEST RESEARCH IS NO SURPRISE 
SUN BEDS CAN INCREASE YOUR RISK OF 
SKIN DAMAGE SO IT TIME TO SWAP 
RAYS FOR SPRAYS 
HOW TO AVOID THE RETIREMENT CLIFF 
EDGE HALF OF PENSIONERS SAY THEY 
ARE UNHAPPY WITH LIFE WITHOUT WORK 
HAVE A LISTEN TO THIS 
BIRD SONG 
IT'S BIRD SONG A RADIO STATION 
WENT BUST AND IT'S PLAYING BIRD 
SONG THE LISTENERS ARE LOVING IT 
FIRST PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY 
HAVE SAID THEY AGREE WITH THE 
VERDICTS REACHED BY THE JURY AT THE 
DIANA INQUEST THE JURY DECIDED 
THAT DIANA AND DODI FAYED WERE 
UNLAWFULLY KILLED AND PINNED THE 
BLAME ON THEIR DRIVER HENRI PAUL 
AND THE PAPARAZZI PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO 
WERE CHASING THEM BUT DODI'S 
FATHER FATHER AL FAYED SAYS HE'S 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE VERDICT 
FOR THE INQUEST JURY THE OFED WAS 
CLEAR PRINCESS DIANA AND DODI 
FAYED WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED BUT 
NOT THROUGH CONSPIRACY THEIR 
DEATHS WERE CAUSED BY THE WRECKLESS 
ACTIONS OF THEIR DRIVER HENRI PAUL 
AND THE PAPARAZZI WHO CHASED THEIR 
CAR THROUGH THE STREETS OF PARIS 
CONCLUSIONS THAT THE PRINCESS'S 
SONS WILLIAM AND HARRY HAVE 
WELCOMED 
FOR MOHAMED AL FAYED THERE'S 
DISAPPOINTMENT HE STILL BELIEVES 
THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY A THEORY 
ONE FORMER ADVISER SAYS HE WAS 
ENCOURAGED TO BELIEVE 
THE PEOPLE 
AROUND HIM FED WHAT MANY OF US 
VIEWED AS A FANTASY AND I THINK 
THAT THAT IS DEPLORABLE 
BUT IT 
SEEMS FOR MANY OTHERS THE TIME HAS 
COME TO MOVE ON 
I HAVE GREAT 
SYMPATHY WITH AL FAYED HE LOST HIS 
SON BUT I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN SOONER IT IS A TREMENDOUS 
WASTE OF PUBLIC MONEY 
I THINK FOR 
THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY THINGS 
SHOULD MOVE ON NOW IT'S GOOD 
THERE'S BEEN AN INQUIRY HOPEFULLY 
IT'S FINISHED 
MOHAMED AL FAYED IS 
CONSIDERING HIS LEGAL OPTIONS BUT 
IT IS HARD TO SEE WHAT THEY MIGHT 
BE NOW HIS CLAIMS OF CONSPIRACY 
HAVE BEEN DISCREDITED BY A JURY 
IN A FEW MINUTES WE WILL BE TALKING 
TO MR. AL FAYED'S SPOKESWOMAN AND 
MAX CLIFFORD WHO USED TO WORK FOR 
HIM HIM DETECTIVES INVESTIGATING THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF NINE YEAR OLD 
SOONON MATTHEWS ARE CONTINUING TO 
QUESTION HER MOTHER SHE'S BEEN 
ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF PERVERTING 
THE THE COURSE OF JUSTICE SHANNON 
WAS DISCOVERED IN A HOUSE NOT FAR 
FROM HER HOME TWENTY FOUR DAYS AFTER SHE 
WENT MISSING 
THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
MAY SCRAP TORCH RELAYS FOR FUTURE 
GAMES FOLLOWING THE 
IN 
GAMES FOLLOWING THE PROTESTS IN LONDON AND PARIS THE FLAME IS DUE 
TO ARRIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO TODAY 
THREE PEOPLE SCALED THE CITY'S 
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE TO HANG THE 
TIBETAN FLAG AND TWO BANNERS AS 
PART OF A PROTEST THERE 
FRIENDS WHO DINED WITH KATE AND 
GERRY MCCANN ON THE NIGHT THEIR 
DAUGHTER DISAPPEARED ALREADY 
QUESTIONED BY LEICESTERSHIRE POLICE 
TODAY THE GROUP WILL BE 
INTERVIEWED IN THE PRESENCE OF 
PORTUGUESE DETECTIVES LET'S GET 
MORE FROM OUR REPORTER WHO IS 
OUTSIDE THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS IN 
ENDERBY ENDERBY GOOD MORNING THESE PEOPLE HAVE 
TOLD THEIR STORY PROBABLY MORE THAN 
ONCE TO POLICE WHY ARE THEY BEING 
QUESTIONED AGAIN 
OF COURSE WE ARE 
TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM THE ANNIVERSARY 
OF MADELINE'S DISAPPEARANCE AND 
THIS SEEMS TO BE A CONSOLIDATION 
EXERCISE TO REVIEW THE EVIDENCE IN 
THIS CASE THE OFFICERS FROM 
PORTUGAL TRAVELLED HERE YESTERDAY 
THEY WILL BE SITTING IN ON THESE 
INTERVIEWS NOT DIRECTLY ASKING THE 
QUESTIONS OF ALL SEVEN OF THE 
MCCANNS' FRIENDS WHO WERE DINING 
WITH THEM THE NIGHT MADELINE WENT 
MISSING THEY WILL BE ACCOMPANIED 
BY INTERPRETERS THE QUESTIONS 
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO 
THE LEICESTERSHIRE FORCE SO THEIR 
DETECTIVES CAN ASK THEM VIA THE 
HOME OFFICE AS FAR AS WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN WE ARE UNSURE OFFICERS 
FROM PORTUGAL CAME HERE SIX MONTHS 
AGO TO REVIEW THE FORENSIC D. N. A. 
EVIDENCE BEING COLLECTED IN 
BIRMINGHAM AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD THE 
FULL OUTCOME FOR THAT AS I SAY 
THREE AND A HALF DAYS WORTH OF 
QUESTIONING TO INTERVIEW ALL SEVEN 
OF THE FRIENDS WHO WERE WITH THE 
MCCANNS THAT EVENING 
DO WE KNOW 
WHY THE PORTUGUESE POLICE WANT TO 
OBSERVE THE INTERVIEWS THEMSELVES 
I THINK THIS IS VERY MUCH THE 
APPROACH THAT'S BEEN TAKEN BY THE 
SENIOR OFFICER IN CHARGE OF THE 
INVESTIGATION HE TOOK OVER IN 
OCTOBER AND AS I SAID THAT WAS 
WHEN THEY CAME OVER SIGNIFICANTLY 
THE LAST TIME TO REVIEW THE D. N. A. 
EVIDENCE HE'S BROUGHT HIS TEAM 
WITH HIM THEY WILL BE SITTING IN 
TO LISTEN TO THOSE ANSWERS WITH 
THEIR INTERPRETERS AND NO DOUBT 
THEN TAKE THEM AWAY AGAIN FOR 
CONSIDERATION WE KNOW NOT HUGE 
AMOUNT ABOUT THE DIRECTION HE'S 
TAKING IN THIS INVESTIGATION BUT 
HE DOES APPEAR FROM THE FEW 
COMMENTS WE HAVE HEARD FROM HIM TO 
BE A VERY CALM METHODICAL DETECTIVE 
SO FROM FOCUSING ON THE HI TECH END 
OF THE INVESTIGATION THE FORENSICS 
THEY NOW SEEM TO BE GOING BACK TO 
THE MORE BASIC POLICE INVESTIGATION 
WHICH IS TO REVIEW AND CLARIFY THE 
TIME LINE OF EVENTS ON THE EVENING 
THAT MADELINE WENT MISSING IT'S IT'S KNOWN AS THE RETIREMENT CLIFF EDGE 
WHEN PEOPLE SUDDENLY STOP WORKING 
BUT NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS URGING 
PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT GIVING UP 
WORK GRADUALLY IT'S RELEASED A 
SURVEY SHOWING HALF OF PENSIONERS 
FELT UNHAPPY ON THE FIRST DAY OF 
THEIR RETIREMENT 
THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES PEOPLE LIKE 
GWEN ARE SETTING AN EXAMPLE THAT 
MORE OF US EMULATE WHEN SHE 
RETIRED SHE STOPPED WORK GRADUALLY 
NOW AGED SEVENTY THREE SHE DOES PART TIME 
OFFICE WORK AND FINDS IT ESSENTIAL 
TO HER WELL BEING 
IT KEEPS MY MIND 
GOING IT GIVES ME SOMETHING ELSE 
TO THINK ABOUT BUT MYSELF AND 
GIVES ME A DIFFERENT ASPECT ON ALL 
SORTS OF THINGS 
THERE ARE MANY 
REASONS TO STAY AT WORK APART FROM 
MONEY ACCORDING TO A SURVEY SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT 
OF PEOPLE SAID THEY WOULD MISS WORK 
COLLEAGUES AND FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT SAID THEY ENJOY 
THEIR JOB HOWEVER ONLY SEVENTEEN PER CENT SAID 
THEY WOULD MISS THE OFFICE PARTY 
AND ONLY NINE PER CENT THE CANTEEN GROUNDS 
PERHAPS FOR A GRADUAL RETIREMENT 
WHAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY PROBABLY 
WELL ADVISED TO THINK ABOUT IS 
WHETHER THEY WANT TO EASE THEM SELF 
IN WHETHER THAT'S BY TAKING STEP 
DOWN IN THEIR CAREER CONTINUING TO 
WORK FULL TIME BUT DING LESS 
DEMANDING JOB OR GOING PART TIME 
OR PERHAPS CONSIDERING VOLUNTEERING 
AGE CONCERN IS ALSO ACCUSING THE 
GOVERNMENT OF DOUBLE STANDARDS 
EVEN THOUGH THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORK 
AND PENSIONS SAYS EMPLOYERS SHOULD 
HELP THEIR STAFF TO RETIRE 
GRADUALLY WORKERS CAN STILL BE 
FORCED TO GO WHEN THEY REACH THEIR 
SIXTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY 
POLICE IN ZIMBABWE HAVE ARRESTED AT 
LEAST FIVE ELECTION OFFICIALS FOR 
ALLEGEDLY UNDERCOUNTING VOTES CAST 
FOR PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE IN THE 
ELECTION HELD TEN DAYS AGO POLICE 
SAID THE OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN 
CHARGED WITH FRAUD AND CRIMINAL 
ABUSE OF DUTY 
A TEENAGE BOY HAS BEEN KILLED BY A 
SHARK OFF THE EAST COAST OF 
AUSTRALIA THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WAS 
SURFING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILES NORTH OF 
SYDNEY WHEN THE SHARK ATTACKED HIM 
DOCTORS WERE UNABLE TO SAVE HIM 
A CONTROVERSIAL CULL OF BADGERS IN 
WALES COULD GET THE GO AHEAD TODAY 
THE WELSH ASSEMBLY IS LIKELY TO 
SUPPORT THE MOVE AS A WAY OF 
CONTROLLING THE SPREAD OF T. B. IN 
CATTLE BUT ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS 
SAY THIS IS NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE 
THAT BADGERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
SPREADING THE DISEASE 
GOOD MORNING CATTLE REARING AND 
DAIRY FARMING IS HUGE BUSINESS HERE 
IN WEST WALES BUT MANY FARMS LIKE 
THIS ONE HAVE LOST A LOT OF CATTLE 
TO 
HERE THEY HAVE LOST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
TO 
THE DISEASE FARMERS SAY BADGERS 
ARE TO BLAME AND THEY WANT A PRETTY 
WIDESPREAD CULL BUT BADGER 
SUPPORTERS WHILE ACCEPTING THERE 
IS A PROBLEM WITH BOVINE T. B. SAY 
BADGERS ARE NOT TO BLAME 
KNOWN TO MANY AS THE MID WALES 
BADGERMAN GARETH HAS GAINED THE 
TRUST OF THESE ANIMALS FOR MORE 
THAN THIRTY YEARS 
THEY ARE DOING HERE 
WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
ALL THEY ARE DOING IS GOING ABOUT 
WHAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS DONE LET'S 
HOPE WE NEVER LOSE THEM 
FOR YEARS 
BADGERS HAVE RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY 
BEEN BLAMED FOR SPREADING 
AMONG CATTLE FARMERS 
HAVE LONG CALLED FOR A WIDESPREAD 
CULL OF BADGERS AND IN WALES THE 
ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO 
ANNOUNCE ITS NEXT MOVE BADGER 
GROUPS WANT MORE CATTLE TO BE 
TESTED TO ESTABLISH EXACTLY WHERE 
THE T. B. INFECTION COMES FROM BUT 
FARMERS AND MANY VETS SAY BADGER 
NUMBERS MUST BE KEPT DOWN 
AS FAST 
AS WE ARE TESTING THE CATTLE AND 
REMOVING THEM FROM THE EQUATION 
OBVIOUSLY MORE CATTLE GET INFECTED 
THROUGH THE BADGERS COMPENSATING COMPENSATING WELSH FARMERS FOR T. B. INFECTED 
CATTLE COSTS FIFTEEN MILLION LAST YEAR 
EVERYONE AGREES IT IS A DISEASE 
THAT MUST BE KEPT UNDER CONTROL 
BUT IS ERADICATING BADGERS THE 
RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT IT 
IF THE MINISTER TODAY DOES ANNOUNCE 
BADGER ERADICATION PROGRAMME WITHIN 
A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF 
WALES IT WILL BE PART OF A WIDER 
PROGRAMME THAT WILL INCLUDE FURTHER 
ANIMAL TESTING A BADGER CULL WILL 
GO DOWN VERY WELL WITH FARMERS BUT 
IT WILL BE DEEPLY UNPOPULAR WITH 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
NEWS JUST IN FROM THE WATER 
INDUSTRY REGULATOR OFWAT IT'S 
GOING TO FINE THE WATER COMPANY 
SEVERN TRENT WATER MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE 
MILLION FOR DELIBERATELY PROVIDING 
FALSE INFORMATION TO THE REGULATOR 
AND A POOR SERVICE TO ITS CUSTOMERS 
DECLAN WILL HAVE MORE DETAILS IN A 
COUPLE OF MINUTES 
WE ARE THROWING AWAY FORTY FOUR MILLION 
APPLES AND SIXTEEN MILLION BANANAS 
EVERY DAY A SURVEY OUT TODAY SHOWS 
THE U. K. FAMILIES BIN AROUND A THIRD 
OF THE FOOD THEY BUY AND FORTY PER CENT OF IT 
IS FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THE VALUE 
OF ALL THAT WASTE IS THOUGHT TO BE 
ABOUT THREE BILLION 
THOSE ARE THIS MORNING'S TOP 
STORIES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
DANGERS OF SUN BEDS IN A FEW 
MINUTES A SUN BED ADDICT SAYS SHE 
CAN'T GIVE IT UP DESPITE NEW 
EVIDENCE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF 
GETTING CANCER 
LET'S LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGES THE 
DAILY EXPRESS DIANA WAS UNLAWFULLY 
KILLED THAT IS WHAT THE INQUEST 
FOUND FOUND THE TIMES HAS A DIFFERENT 
PHOTOGRAPH THE PAPARAZZI ARRESTED 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT 
THEY ARE HELD TO BE PARTLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS 
THE DAILY MAIL ASKING A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS NOW END THE DIANA MYTHS 
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH FOCUSES ON THE 
REACTION OF THE PRINCES HOPING 
THAT TEN YEARS OF SPECULATION OVER 
THE DEATH OF THEIR MOTHER WILL 
FINALLY END AFTER THE JURY DECIDED 
THAT SHE WAS UNLAWFULLY KILLED 
LET'S GET MORE ON THAT AND SPEAK TO 
KATHARINE WITTY MR. MOHAMED AL 
FAYED'S SPOKESWOMAN THE PRINCES 
SAY LET IT BE THE END IS THAT WHAT 
MR. MOHAMED AL FAYED IS GOING TO DO UP 
ALL HE HAS WANTED IS TO GET THE UP TRUTH IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS WE 
HAVE HEARD FROM MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
WITNESSES IT HAS BEEN WIDE RANGING 
AND IT NEEDS TO BE TODAY HE WILL 
BE CONSIDERING HIS OPTIONS TALKING 
TO HIS LEGAL TEAM AND DECIDING WHAT 
TO DO 
DESPITE SAYING ON OATH HE 
WOULD ACCEPT THE VERDICT HE STILL 
HASN'T DECIDED WHETHER HE DOES OR 
NOT 
HE ACCEPTED THE VERDICT AT A NOT TIME WHEN IT HADN'T BEEN RULED OUT 
THAT PRINCE PHILLIP AND THE QUEEN 
WEREN'T GOING TO BE APPROACHED IT 
WASN'T CLEAR AT THAT STAGE THAT THE 
FRENCH PATHOLOGISTS WHO CONDUCTED 
THE BLOOD TESTS ON HENRI PAUL WERE 
NOT PREPARED TO COME AND GIVE 
EVIDENCE EVERYBODY IS SAYING LET 
IT END HERE IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON 
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY JUST AS 
WILLIAM AND HARRY WILL NEVER GET 
OVER THE DEATH OF THEIR MOTHER 
MOHAMED WON'T GET OVER THE DEATH OF 
HIS SON YOU DON'T JUST MOVE ON 
FROM THE DEATH OF A CHILD IT IS 
WHETHER THERE IS ANY LEGAL REDRESS 
FOLLOWING THESE INQUESTS AND THAT 
IS SOMETHING HE WILL BE LOOKING AT 
ALSO IT DOES PUT HIM IN A 
DIFFICULT POSITION YOU MENTION 
HENRI PAUL THE INQUEST FOUND SHE 
WAS UNLAWFULLY KILLED DUE TO THE 
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF HENRI PAUL HE 
WAS HIS EMPLOYER 
MOHAMMED OWNS THE 
RITZ HE DIDN'T PERSONALLY EMPLOY 
HIM THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF THINGS 
THAT HAVE BEEN SAID OVER THE PAST 
SIX MONTHS IN THE INQUEST AND I 
THINK YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME 
OF THE EVIDENCE OF HIS BODY GUARDS 
THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT MOHAMMED 
AND DODI WERE THE ONES WHO OKED THE 
PLAN THEY MADE A LOT OF MONEY 
WRITING BOOKS SAYING THAT AND THAT 
HAS BEEN DISCREDITED WE HEARD THAT 
HAS NET KHAN MADE A STATEMENT TO 
THE POLICE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR SAYING DIANA 
ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP AND WE HAVE 
LOTS OF PEOPLE PARADE DODI AS 
SOMEONE WHO WAS MAKING MR. KHAN 
JEALOUS 
THIS IS NOT RELEVANT TO JEALOUS WHAT THE INQUEST FOUND THAT SHE 
WAS UNLAWFULLY KILLED 
THE JURY ARE 
PRESENTED WITH FIVE DIFFERENT 
VERDICT OPTIONS AND THAT IS THE ONE 
THEY CHOSE THIS DOESN'T MEAN TO 
SAY I AM TALKING ABOUT THE 
EVIDENCE SHOWN IN THE INQUEST 
THERE ARE A LOT OF NEW REL VAN FAX 
THAT HAVE COME OUT THERE HAVE BEEN 
A LOT OF MYTHS AND A LOT OF DAMAGE 
TO MOHAMMED'S REPUTATION IT IS 
IMPORTANT WE GET SOME THINGS CLEAR 
SOME OF THE VIEWERS WILL BE 
CONCERNED THAT HE IS CONSIDERING 
HIS OPTIONS GIVEN THAT LOT OF 
TIME AND MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT ON 
THIS CAN IT NOT END NOW 
THAT IS 
SOMETHING HE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT 
WITH HIS LAWYERS IN TERMS OF THE 
COST OF THE INQUEST IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS LAID AT 
MOHAMMED'S FEET BUT IT IS NOT 
REALLY HIS RESPONSIBILITY IT WAS 
THE CORONER'S DECISION ABOUT THE 
COST AND SCOPE AND ALL THE 
WITNESSES CALLED DON'T FORGET 
MOHAMMED EMPLOYS SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE IN 
THE U. K. PAYS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
OF POUNDS WORTH OF TAXES IN THE U. K. 
AND DOESN'T HAVE A BRITISH PASSPORT 
LET'S TALK TO MAX CLIFFORD WHO HAS 
WORKINGED WITH MR. AL FAYED IN THE 
PAST PAST GOOD MORNING DON'T KNOW IF YOU 
HEARD THAT IT SEEMS IT'S NOT QUITE 
OVER FOR MOHAMED AL FAYED 
STILL CONSIDERING HIS OPTIONS ARE 
YOU SURPRISED 
NO I DON'T THINK 
IT'LL EVER BE OVER FOR MOHAMMED HE 
IS TOTE CONVINCED THEY ARE MURDERED 
OBVIOUSLY IT IS HIS SON L. DON'T 
THINK IT'LL EVER BE OVER FOR HIM 
AND I THINK HE WILL CONTINUE THIS 
AS LONG AS HE CAN BECAUSE THAT'S 
WHAT HE TOTALLY AND FIRMLY BELIEVES 
IN SPITE OF THE VERDICT OF THE JURY 
HE IS THE SORT OF PERSON WHO DOES 
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CONTINUE THIS 
CAMPAIGN IF HE SO WISHES 
WELL HE 
HAS THE RESOURCES AND HE CERTAINLY 
HAS THE PASSION AND HE BELIEVES 
THAT THIS IS NOT JUSTICE L. MEAN 
ONE OF THE THINGS I SUPPOSE THAT 
CONCERNS ME IS THAT HENRI PAUL IS 
BLAMED FOR THIS AND THE PAPARAZZI 
WELL THERE WERE NO PAPARAZZI AT 
THIS HEARING NO ONE HEARD ANYTHING 
ABOUT THE MEN THAT WERE CLOSEST TO 
THIS AND ACCORDING TO THE VERDICT 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS NOT ONE OF 
THEM WAS THERE TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAD 
HAPPENED AND WHAT WENT ON AND WHAT 
THEY SAW SO THERE IS ONE MAJOR 
THING WHICH IS MISSING THEY ARE 
GETTING THE BLAME FOR THIS ALONG 
WITH HENRI PAUL BUT NONE OF THEM 
WERE TO TALK ABOUT IT AND DISCUSS 
WHAT HAPPENED WHAT WENT ON WHAT 
THEY SAW AND WHAT LED TO THE CRASH 
THE ONLY PEOPLE IF YOU LIKE THAT 
PROPERLY WITNESSED IT SO THAT'S 
ONE HUGE THING TO ME WHICH WAS 
MISSING FROM THIS WHOLE TRIAL SO SO GO BACK TO THE ELEMENT OF THE 
PAPARAZZI IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN 
THERE GIVING CHASE HENRI PAUL 
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PRESUMABLY 
DRIVING QUITE AS FAST AS HE WAS 
THAT EXTENT AT THE VERY LEAST THEY 
BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY DON'T 
THEY 
WELL I MEAN ABSOLUTELY THEY RIGHT THAT'S THE POINT I'M MAKING 
BUT NONE OF THEM WERE THERE TO 
EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WENT 
ON THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE CAR 
ACCORDING TO WHAT WE ARE BEING TOLD 
THEY ARE IN NO SMALL WAY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRASH BUT WE 
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM ONE OF THEM SO 
THIS HAS GONE ON FOR SIX MONTHS 
BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE CERTAIN 
THINGS VERY IMPORTANT WHICH WE 
HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THAT'S THE ONE 
I SUPPOSE FOR ME THE MAJOR 
DISAPPOINTMENT OF THIS WHOLE 
HEARING WHICH HAS GONE ON FOR A 
LONG LONG TIME 
BUT APART FROM 
THAT YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH THE 
VERDICT AS IT WAS AND IT IS TIME 
DO YOU BELIEVE NOW TO DRAW A LINE 
UNDER IT AND MOVE ON 
I THINK THE 
PUBLIC WANT TO MOVE ON THEY WANT 
TO REMEMBER DIANA YOU KNOW SHE 
WAS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR WOMEN 
ON THE PLANET YOU KNOW LOVED AND 
ADMIRED ALL OVER THE WORLD SO THEY 
WANT THAT AND I THINK IN MANY WAYS 
OBVIOUSLY MOHAMMED WOULD LIKE TO 
MOVE ON HIS SON WHO HE LOVED AND 
CHERISHED ALSO DIED IN THE CRASH 
BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE FEELS AND 
WHAT HE TOTALLY BELIEVES I CAN'T 
THINK THAT HE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO 
I DO THINK FOR MOST OF THE BRITISH 
PUBLIC THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH NOW 
AND THEY WANT TO MOVE ON AND PUT 
THIS BEHIND THEM L. DON'T THINK THE 
VERDICT IS GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE 
TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE THE IMPORTANT 
THING IS THAT IT CAME FROM THE 
PUBLIC I THINK NINE OF THE ELEVEN BUT 
IF YOU BELIEVE IT IS CONSPIRACY 
YOU STILL WILL AND IF YOU BELIEVE 
IT IS A TRAGIC ACCIDENT THE BE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF HENRI PAUL AND 
THE PAPARAZZI YOU WILL STILL THINK 
THE SAME 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME TODAY 
SUNKISSED OR KISS OF DEATH WHY WE 
CAN'T SHAKE OFF THE OBSESSION WITH 
TANNING THAT'S DAMAGING THE YOUNG 
WOULD YOU CONSIDER PAIR THE MEN 
WHO WANT TO LOOK THEIR PARTNERS IN 
THE EYE BY SPORTING HIGH HEELS 
CHRIS HOLLINS AND I MAY HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT THAT COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AGO IT IS TO DO WITH MR. 
SARKOZY AND HIS LITTLE WELL NOT 
LITTLE STACKS 
NOW THE WEATHER WITH CAROL 
IT IS A COLD START TO THE DAY AND 
FROSTY FOR SOME SOME MIST AROUND 
FIRST THING THAT SHOULDN'T PRESENT 
TOO MANY PROBLEMS AT ALL AND WE 
HAVE SOME SHOWERS AND RAIN SO IF 
WE HAVE LOOK AT THE RADAR IT 
GOES BACK TWELVE HOURS YOU CAN SEE 
WHERE WE HAVE THE SHOWERS AND ALSO 
A BAND OF RAIN EXTENDING ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND IN THROUGH 
MERSEYSIDE OVER TOWARDS 
LINCOLNSHIRE WILL TURN MORE 
SHOWERY TO THE NORTH OF THE 
COUNTRY RAIN ACROSS SCOTLAND BY 
NINE ZERO ZERO A M. SNOW OVER THE HILLS BUT ON 
IER BURSTS AROUND BE AER DANSHIRE 
SNOW TO LOWER LEVELS FOR SOUTHERN 
SCOTLAND AND MUCH OF NORTHERN 
ENGLAND A BUT THEIVELY START ALBEIT 
COLD THEN WE RUN INTO THE RAIN 
BAND STILL WINTRYNESS IN IT TO 
HIGHER GROUND BUT FROM MIDLANDS IT 
EAST ANGLIA TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST COLD

BLUE SKIES AS WE HAVE IN LONDON 
TWO IN CARDIFF NO HEATWAVE BY 
NINE POINT OH OH A SHOWERY RAIN WILL EXTEND 
ACROSS ANGLESEY AND NORTH OF WALES 
AND FOR NORTHERN IRELAND SOME 
SUNSHINE BUT CLOUD WILL BUILD 
THROUGH THE DAY AND LATER ON WE 
WILL SEE SOME SPLASHES OF RAIN 
THROUGH THE DAY THE FIRST BAND OF 
RAIN ACROSS SCOTLAND CONTINUES TO 
PUSH DOWN INTO THE CENTRAL LOWLANDS 
THE SOUTHERN LANDS AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND FOR THE REST OF US 
WELL WE HAVE SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
BUT SOME OF THE SHOWERS COULD BE 
HEAVY HEAVY NOW THEN MOST OF THE SHOWERS 
THROUGH THIS EVENING WILL TEND TO 
DIE AWAY ONCE AGAIN LIKE LAST 
NIGHT THERE WILL BE SOME FROST 
AROUND THE RAIN BAND MOVING ACROSS 
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND WILL 
CONTINUE ACROSS THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND AND MORE OR LESS FIZZLE OUT 
AS IT DOES BUT 
COLD NIGHT AND COLD START BUT OF COURSE WHERE THE 
CLOUD HAS BEEN BROKEN OVERNIGHT IS 
WHERE WE WILL SEE BEAUTIFUL 
SUNSHINE FIRST THING BUT LIKE 
TODAY TOMORROW WE ARE LOOKING AT 
SHOWERS AND SOME COULD PROVE TO BE 
HEAVY AND THERE WILL STILL BE SOME 
SNOW OVER THE HILLS TOP 
TEMPERATURES TOMORROW FOURTEEN IN LONDON 
BUT THE OUTLOOK REMAINS UNSETTLED 
THE WINTRY SHOWERS ARE DIMINISHING 
RISK BUT TEMPERATURES DISAPPOINTING

WATER WATCHDOG OFWAT THAT FINE OF 
THIRTY SIX MILLION IS ABOUT THREE PER CENT OF SEVERN 
TRENT'S TURNOVER IT IS BEING FINED

WATCHDOG SAYS THIS BEHAVIOUR WAS 
UNACCEPTAL AND IT SAYS IT LED TO 
SOME CUSTOMERS PIEING HIGHER BILLS

TWO CHARGES OF FRAUD THAT WERE 
BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE SERIOUS 
FRAUD OFFICE AND ALSO SEPARATELY 
BEING FINED THIRTY SIX MILLION BY THE 
WATER WATCHDOG OFWAT 
WE WILL KEEP ABREAST OF THAT STORY 
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING TWO OTHER 
THINGS TO TELL YOU ABOUT ONE IS 
ABOUT HOUSES AND THE ABBEY NATIONAL 
THE LAST OF THE BIG HOME LENDERS TO 
OFFER MORTGAGES TO CUSTOMERS WHO 
DON'T HAVE ANY SAVINGS IT'S 
WITHDRAWN ITS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGES IT 
MEANS ANYONE LOOKING TO BUY HOME 
NOW MUST HAVE A DEPOSIT OF AT LEST 
FIVE PER CENT A SURVEY OF PHONE CUSTOMERS 
TODAY SHOW THAT IS HALF CUSTOMERS 
FOR ALL PHONE COMPANIES ARE 
DISSATISFIED THAT'S ACCORDING TO 
RESEARCH BY USWITCH USWITCH OF 
COURSE EARNS ITS MONEY BY 
ENCOURAGING CUSTOMERS TO SWITCH SO 
SOME OF THE PHONE COMPANIES ARE 
SUGGESTING THEY WOULD SAY THAT 
WOULDN'T THEY SHARES IN LONDON 
YESTERDAY ABOVE SIX THOUSAND THERE ARE 
FRESH WARNINGS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHO USE SUNBEDS ARE GREATLY 
INCREASING THEIR RISK OF DEVELOPING 
SKIN CANCER ALISON HARPER IS AT A 
TANNING CENTRE IN WINCHESTER 
IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE THAT 
TANNING CAUSES DAMAGE TO YOUR SKIN 
BUT THESE LATEST STATISTICS FROM 
CANCER RESEARCH HAVE FOUND THAT EIGHTY TWO PER CENT 
OF PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE HAVE 
USED A SUNBED AT SOME POINT IN 
THEIR LIVES 
THEIR LIVES 
AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE SO THEY 
HAVE INCREASED THEIR RISK OF 
DEVELOPING SKIN CANCER BY SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT NOW 
WE ARE NATION OF PEOPLE WHO LOVE 
HAVING LITTLE BIT OF COLOUR ONE 
IN THREE WOMEN HAVE USED A SUNBED 
ONE IN FOUR MEN HAVE ALSO USED 
SUNBEDS WHAT IS EIGHT SOLUTION IN 
RA MOMENT WE WILL TALK TO THE SALON 
OWNER HERE IN WINCHESTER ABOUT 
RESPONSIBLE TANNING AND BEING 
RESPONSIBLE FOR CUSTOMERS BUT LET'S 
HEAR FIRST FROM TWO YEAR OLD WHO 
USES A SUNBED EVERY WEEK A TWENTY ONE 
YEAR OLD YEAR OLD HAVE USED THEM SINCE 
I WAS SIXTEEN I LOVE GOING ON SUNBEDS BECAUSE YOU 
GET A NATURAL TAN AND THERE IS 
NOTHING BETTER THAN A TAN BUS IT 
MAKES YOU LOOK HEALTHY L. THINK 
EVERYONE WANTS TO LOOK HEALTHY IF 
I'M FEELING PASTEY I THINK I WILL 
GO ON SUNBEDS TWO OR THREE TIMES A 
WEEK REALISTICALLY I SHOULD GO 
ONCE A WEEK L. WILL GO FOR ABOUT 
FIVE OR SIX MINUTES IT IS USUALLY 
ENOUGH L. THINK ANY SUNBED IS 
DANGEROUS BUT IT IS THE PRICE WE 
PAY TO LOOK HEALTHY AND TANNED L. 
REMEMBER WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN I DID GO ON 
FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES NOW IT IS 
MORE MONITORED SO ESPECIALLY 
PEOPLE IN THEIR TEENS THEY DON'T 
JUST PUT LOADS OF TOKENS IN A 
MACHINE AND THEY ARE ON A SUNBED 
RISKING THEMSELVES NOW IT IS A 
WILL THE BETTER THIS SALON THEY 
ARE VERY GOOD THE BEDS ARE 
MONITORED THEY KEEP A RECORD OF 
HOW OFTEN YOU ARE ON THE BED AND 
IF SOMEONE COMES IN AND SAYS I 
WANT FIFTEEN MINUTES THEY WILL SAY 
NO SEVEN MINUTES FOR YOUR SKIN 
LOTS OF PEOPLE WANT TANS THIS ONE 
HERE SAYSS BECOME AN EVERNIGHT 
CELEBRITY HAVING TAN DOES THAT 
MEAN YOU WILL LOOK LIKE CELEBRITY 
I'M NOT SURE NOW LYNDSEY SHELDON 
IS HERE DO YOU THINK IT IS TIME TO 
PULL THE PLUG ON SUNBEDS BECAUSE OF 
THE RISK 
ABSOLUTELY NOT L. FEEL IT 
IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT 
COMPARED TO THE SUN THE USE OF 
SUNBEDS POSES A VERY MINIMAL RISK 
SUNBEDS POSES A VERY MINIMAL RISK THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF THE 
STATISTICS YOU HAVE QUOTED IS SOME 
IS UNPROVEN AND A LOT IS CONJECTURE 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT A 
CORRECTLY METERED DOSE OF SUN 
ABOUTS DEDS RATHER THAN GOING OUT 
INTO THE SUN POSES BENEFITS TO 
HEALTH AS WELL AS A PERCEIVED RISK 
IN AS MUCH AS IT CAN DISSIPATE 
SEASONAL AFFECT AFFECTIVE DISORDER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE IS TALK 
OF MAYBE BRINGING IN LEGISLATION 
SCOTLAND ARE HOPING TO BRING IN 
LAWS TO REGULATE THE USE OF SUNBEDS

STEVE 
STEVE STEVE A CHANGEABLE MORNING TO SAY THE 
LEAST FOR THE NORTHERN LINE ON THE 
UNDERGROUND MAINLINE SERVICES OUT ON THE ROADS LET'S LOOK 
OUTSIDE AN ACCIDENT ON THE NORTH 
CIRCULAR AROUND EDMONTON ON THE 
WESTBOUND SIDE 
YOU CAN SEE POLICE ON THE SCENE 
PRETTY SLOW GOING ON THE APPROACH 
ALSO AN ACCIDENT ON THE SOUTHERN 
PERIMETER ROAD AT HEATHROW MUCH 
THAT'S PARTLY BLOCKED AS YOU CAN 
SEE BUT TRAFFIC GETTING PASSED 
WITHOUT TOO MUCH OF PROBLEM WE 
HAVE ALSO GOT FAIRLY LIGHT GOING 
AROUND THE NEW CROSS ONE WAY SYSTEM 
FORTY YEARS AGO TODAY A BURNING 
AIRLINER CRASH LANDED AT HEATHROW 
SHORTLY AFTER TAKE OFF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PEOPLE 
ESCAPED BUT FIVE DIED INCLUDING A 
YOUNG STEWARDESS BARBARA JANE 
HARRISON STAYED ON BOARD TO SAVE 
LIVES AND BECAME THE ONLY WOMAN IN 
PEACETIME TO BE AWARDED THE GEORGE 
CROSS HER SISTER SAYS MANY PEOPLE 
WOULDN'T HAVE SHOWN HER COURAGE 
THE EVENTS HAPPENED SO QUICKLY THAT 
PERHAPS SHE DIDN'T STAND TO THINK 
ABOUT IT TOO MUCH AND YOU JUST DID 
WHAT YOU KNOW YOUR DUTY THAT'S 
WHAT SHE WAS TRAINED FOR TO HELP 
OTHER PEOPLE AND HOPEFULLY THAT'S 
JUST WHAT SHE DID 
A LOOK AT THE 
WEATHER NOW 
FOR MOST A BRIGHT START BUT IT IS A 
CHILLY YET AGAIN ENJOY THE 
SUNSHINE BECAUSE I THINK WE WILL 
SEE RATHER MORE IN THE WAY OF 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING AS THE DAY WEARS 
ON JUST THE ODD SHOWER FIRST THING 
FOR MOST IT IS THAT BRIGHT AND 
CHILLY START TO THE DAY AND THEN 
SHOWERS BECOMING MORE WIDESPREAD 
ALTHOUGH AS EVER HIT AND MISS 
MAYBE THE ODD HEAVY SHOWER AROUND 
THEY ARE FAIRLY SLOW MOVING TODAY 
BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT WINDS TOP 
TEMPERATURES AROUND NINE TO ELEVEN SO 
NOT QUITE AS COLD AS IT HAS BEEN OF 
LATE ALTHOUGH STILL RATHER CHILLY 
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT WE WILL AGAIN 
SEE FROSTY CONDITIONS DEVELOPING 
ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD STAY DRY 
TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO FREEZING 
IN RUER SPOTS PERHAPS THREE IN THE 
CITY CITY IN RURAL SPOTS 
THE OUTLOOK NOT TOO BAD FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY DRY WITH 
SUNNY SPELLS AND A TOUCH MILDER 
HOWEVER SHOWERS OR LONGER SPELLS OF 
RAIN RETURN LATER IN THE WEEK 
GOOD MORNING THIS IS BREAKFAST 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY PRINCES 
WILLIAM AND HARRY HAVE SAID THEY 
AGREE WITH THE VERDICTS REACHED BY 
THE JURY AT THE DIANA INQUEST THE 
JURY DECIDED DIANA AND DODI FAYED

AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE IT'S CLEAR 
THE PRINCES WANT TO MOVE ON WE 
HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO MOHAMED AL 
FAYED'S SPOKESWOMAN HE IS STILL 
CONSIDERING HIS OPTIONS 
YES HE IS 
ALTHOUGH THOSE OPTIONS ARE PRETTY 
LIMITED TO BE HONEST LEGALLY AT 
THIS STAGE MOHAMED AL FAYED'S 
SPOKESWOMAN DID SAY HE WAS LOOKING 
AT WHAT HE COULD DO NEXT LEGALLY 
AND HE WAS CONSULTING HIS LAWYERS 
CONSIDERING THE VERDICTS BUT THE 
OPTIONS ARE MOST DEFINITELY LIMITED 
FOR MOHAMED AL FAYED NOW MUCH THE 
INQUEST PROCESS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY 
BROAD IN ITS SCOPE IT HAS LOOKED 
FOR THE EVIDENCE BEHIND ANY OF 
THOSE CONSPIRACY THEORIES IT HAS 
ADDRESSED ALL THE RUMOUR AND 
SPECULATION THAT HAS BUILT UP OVER 
THE PAST TEN AND A HALF YEARS AND 
IT HAS NOT FOUND ANY EVIDENCE OF A 
CONSPIRACY IT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO 
BACK UP THE CLAIMS OF MOHAMED AL 
FAYED REALLY WHERE HE CAN GO FROM 
HERE NOW IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT TO 
SEE IN ERMS OF THE PAPARAZZI THE 
JURY FINDING THAT VERDICT OF 
UNLAWFUL KILLING DUE TO THE GROSS 
NEGLIGENCE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHERS AND 
HENRI PAUL THAT EVENING COULD ANY 
OF THE PHOTOGRAPHERS FACE CHARGES

POWER OVER BRINGING ANY CRIMINAL 
PROSECUTIONS AGAINST FOREIGN 
NATIONALS OVER AN ALLEGED CRIME ON 
FOREIGN SOIL

BEGIN NEW INTERVIEWS WITH THE SEVEN 
PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH KATE AND GERRY 
MCCANN ON THE NIGHT THEIR DAUGHTER 
MADELEINE DISAPPEARED 
NOW LET'S CATCH UP WITH THE WEATHER 
WITH CAROL 
GOOD MORNING IT IS NOT A BAD START 
ACROSS MANY PARTS OF THE BRITISH 
ISLES BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE TO ENJOY 
HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT IT IS 
COLD AND WE HAVE HAD A TOUCH OF 
FROST JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MIST 
BUT THAT SHOULDN'T PRESENT ANY 
PROBLEMS 
PROBLEMS PROBLEMS THE OTHER THING WE HAVE IS ONE OR 
TWO SHOWERS WE ALSO HAVE RAIN 
RAIN EXTENDING FROM NORTHERN 
IRELAND INTO THE NORTH OF WALES 
AROUND MERSEYSIDE AND INTO THE 
DIRECTION OF LINCOLNSHIRE THAT 
RAIN BAND WILL WEAKEN AS IT MOVES 
SOUTH ANOTHER RAIN BAND ACROSS 
SCOTLAND HEAVY AT TIMES 
DEPOSITING SNOW LARGELY TO HIGHER 
GROUND BUT HEAVIER BURSTS TO LOWER 
LEVELS AROUND ABERDEENSHIRE 
ESPECIALLY BUT FOR SOUTHERN UPLANDS 
AND NORTH OF ENGLAND GORGEOUS 
THEN WE RUN INTO THE RAIN BAND AND 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT TO 
MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA SOUTH WEST 
WE ARE LOOKING AT BEAUTIFUL BLUE 
SKIES LIGHT WINDS BUT NO HEATWAVE 
FOR THE NORTH OF WALES WE WILL HAVE 
THAT RAIN BAND MOVING SOUTH 
TURNING SHOWERY AND FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND THIS MORNING A DRY AND 
BRIGHT START WITH SOME SUNSHINE 
BUT FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
SOUTHERN SCOTLAND WHAT YOU WILL 
FIND IS THE CLOUD WILL BUILD AS THE 
RAIN BAND APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH 
INTO THE CENTRAL LOWLANDS SOUTHERN 
UPLANDS AND INTO NORTHERN IRELAND 
FOR ENGLAND AND WALES WELL HERE WE 
ARE LOOKING AT SUNNY INTERVALS BUT 
ALSO SHOWERS SOME OF THOSE SHOWERS 
COULD BE HEAVY IN NATURE THROUGH 
EVENING MOST OF THE SHOWERS WILL 
DIE AWAY THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD YOU CAN SEE HOW THE RAIN 
BAND CONTINUES ACROSS THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND REALLY BECOMING LIGHT AND 
PATCHY NOT MUCH MORE THAN A BAND 
OF CLOUD BUT ON EITHER SIDE WE ARE 
EXPECTING A TOUCH OF FROST BUT OF 
COURSE THAT'S WHERE WE WILL HAVE 
THE CLEAR SKIES AND WHERE IT WILL 
BE GORGEOUS TOMORROW MORNING WITH 
SUNSHINE TOMORROW LIKE TODAY 
FURTHER SHOWERS DEVELOPING 
TEMPERATURES PEAKING AT ABOUT FOURTEEN 
AND STILL SOME SNOW OVER THE HILLS 
OF SCOTLAND AND THE OUTLOOK WELL 
IT REMAINS UNSETTLED WITH 
TEMPERATURES DISAPPOINTING FOR THE 
TIME OF THE YEAR 
THAT'S HOW IT IS LOOKING STRAIGHT 
TO DECLAN A BUSY MORNING WITH BUSY 
NEWS NEWS LET'S RATTLE THROUGH IT FROM B. T. 
THERE IS A NEW TOP BOSS JUST 
ANNOUNCED IN THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES OR 
SO SO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS STANDING 
DOWN AFTER SIX YEARS IN CHARGE YOU 
WILL BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH HIM 
BECAUSE HE IS A REGULAR GUEST HERE 
ON BREAKFAST BUT TO GIVE YOU THREE 
BULLET POINTS TO SUMMARISE HIS SIX 
YEARS IN CHARGE OF B. T. FIRST OF ALL 
HE WAS PART OF THE DOUBLE ACT WITH 
THE CHAIRMAN CHRISTOPHER BLAND WHO 
TOOK B. T. FROM THE BRINK OF 
BANKRUPTCY AND TURNED IT INTO 
SOMETHING MUCH HEALTHIER WHEN HE 
TOOK OVER B. T. HAD B. D. S. THIRTY BILLION IN 
DEBT IT IS NOW DOWN TO A MUCH MORE 
MANAGABLE EIGHT BILLION HE ALSO 
COMPLETELY CHANGED WHAT B. T. WAS 
ABOUT IT WAS ALL ABOUT PHONEM YOUR 
HOME AND PHONE SERVICES FOR BIG 
COMPANIES NOW THE FOCUS IS ON 
BROADBAND HE IS ONE OF THE GUYS 
WHO HAS BUILT BROADBAND BRITAIN 
WHEN HE TOOK OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BROADBAND CUSTOMERS IN THE U. K. NOW 
TWELVE MILLION THE OTHER THING AND IT 
IS ONE THAT HAS SLIPPED BENEATH OUR 
RADAR BECAUSE IT CAN BE DULL BUT IT 
IS INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT FOR B. T. 
AND IT IS THAT SERVICES FOR BIG 
COMPANIES THAT BUSINESS WAS LOSING 
MONEY WHEN HE TOOK CHARGE NOW IT 
IS A VERY PROFITABLE PART OF B. T. SO 
THOSE ARE THE THREE BULLET POINT 
HEADLINES OF BEN BERVEYAN'S TIME IN 
CHARGE THE OTHER STORY DEVELOPING 
IS ABOUT SEVERN TRENT WHICH HASED A 
MID IT HAS LIED TO OFWAT BECAUSE 
OF THAT THE REGULATOR IS FINING IT 
THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVERN TRENT IS ALSO 
TO PLEAD GUILTY TO TWO CHARGES OF 
FRAUD IN THE CITY OF LONDON 
MAGISTRATES' COURT LATER TODAY AND 
WE HAVE BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON WHAT 
HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO THE MORTGAGE 
MARKET FOR YOU THE ABBEY NATIONAL 
BECOME THE LATEST IN THE LAST OF 
THE BIG LENDERS TO SAY IT IS NOT 
GIVING MORTGAGES TO CUSTOMERS WHO 
DON'T HAVE SAVINGS MELANIE BIEN IS 
OUR REGULAR MORTGAGE COMMENTATOR 
THIS HAS TO BE BRIEF BUT THIS MEANS 
THE MORTGAGE MARKET HAS TO CHANGE 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DEPOSIT YOU ARE 
LOCKED OUT 
IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO 
THERE WERE TWENTY ODD LENDERS OFFERING 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT DEALS 
ABBEY IS THE LAST MAJOR 
ONE TO PULL OUT PEOPLE ARE ALSO 
PULLING OUT OF THE NINETY FIVE PER CENT MARKET 
GOING FORWARD PEOPLE NEED A TEN PER CENT 
DEPOSIT 
IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIME DEPOSIT BUYER AND STRUGGLING TO FIND 
SAVINGS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY YOU 
JUST HAVE NO OPTIONS NOW YOU WILL 
NOT GET A HOME 
THERE IS NOWHERE TO 
GO UNLESS YOU HAVE PARENTS TO HELP 
YOU OUT OR YOU QUALIFY FOR 
GOVERNMENT SHARED OWNERSHIP SCHEMES 
THANK YOU MELANIE THANK YOU FOR 
CURTAILING THAT ANALYSIS WE WILL 
KEEP ACROSS B. T. AND SEVERN TRENT FOR 
YOU THROUGHOUT THE MORNING ON 
BREAKFAST AND ON NEWS TWENTY FOUR L. THINK 
WE WILL TALK TO OFWAT AT AROUND 
EIGHT THIRTY A M. ON NEWS TWENTY FOUR 
USUALLY WHEN WE TUNE INTO THE RADIO 
YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THE 
NEWS OR POSSIBLY SOME MUSIC HOW 
ABOUT LISTENING TO LITTLE BIT OF THIS THIS YOU WOULD THINK YOU HAVE OPENED THE 
WINDOW IN THE COUNTRYSIDE CAN WE 
HAVE IT IN THE STUDIO ALL THE TIME 
WE HAVE STUFF TO DO BIRDSONG IS 
FLYING TO THE TOP OF THE CHARTS ONE 
FOR YOU RADIO STATION UP TO 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LISTENING ARE CHOOSING TO 
TUNE INTO THE SOOING SOUNDS 
SOOTHING IT BROADCASTS NOTHING 
BUT BIRDSONG FROM SIX HUNDRED A M. UNTIL 
MIDNIGHT BUT IT HAS BECOME THE 
SURPRISE HIT OF THE DIGITAL RADIO 
WORLD TWO YEAR OLD NATALIA AND 
HER TWIN BROTHER THOMAS ARE HUGE 
FANS 
WHEN WE TURN IT ON THEY GENERALLY 
GIVE A BIG CHORUS OF BIRDIES 
BIRDIES AND THEN KIND OF GET 
BECOME TO EATING AND THROWING THEIR 
FOOD AROUND BUT THEY MOW IT IS 
THERE AND ASK FOR IT EVERY MORNING 
THEY KNOW IT IS THERE THE 
RECORDING WAS MADE ALMOST TWENTY YEARS 
AGO BY QUINTEN HOWARD IN HIS BACK 
GARDEN TODAY HE IS THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF A NUMBER OF RADIO 
STATIONS WHEN ONE OF THEM WENT 
BUST HE DECIDED TO PUT OUT THE 
BIRDSONG INSTEAD 
PEOPLE LIKE IT 
THEY LOVE IT IN FACT THEY WRITE TO 
US AND TELL US THEY PUT IT ON THE 
RADIO AND LEAVE IT ON ALL DAY LONG 
WE HAVE LETTERS FROM PRISONERS WHO 
CAN'T HEAR THE BIRDSONG IN JAIL BUT 
THEY CAN NOW WITH THE RADIO ON 
SO WHAT DO PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER 
HEARD IT BEFORE THINK CHAFFINCHES CHAFFINCHES IT IS QUITE A PEACEFUL SOUND I 
GUESS RELAXING

HOLIDAY HOLIDAY THAT'S A THRUSH 
THE KIND OF STUFF 
I LISTEN TO WHEN DOING MEDITATION 
IT IS COOL 
WOULD YOU LISTEN TO IT 
NO I DON'T THINK I WOULD REALLY 
BUT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MESMERISED 
BY IT SAY THE APPEAL IS OBVIOUS 
I'M SURE PEOPLE REMEMBERED THE 
TIMES WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN IN 
WOODLANDS OR THE COUNTRYSIDE 
LISTENING TO A FANTASTIC ARRAY OF 
BIRDSONG IT MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD 
REMINDS THEM OF SPRING AND SUMMER 
THEIR PAST IT IS FANTASTIC 
BUT BUT EVEN THOUGH THE BIRDSONG BUT CHANNEL HAS SENT THE PUBLIC ALL OF 
TWITTER IT COULD SOON HAVE ITS 
WINGS CLIPPED WHY IT IS NOT 
MAKING ANY MONEY AND HOWEVER MANY 
PEOPLE TUNE IN AND THERE ARE 
RECKONED TO BE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND A WEEK WITH 
NO ADVERTISING REVENUE IT WON'T 
LAST THE BIRDSONG CHANNEL SURVIVES 
AT THE MOMENT ON A WING AND A 
PRAYER PRAYER ON THAT TOPIC BIRDSONG OF ANOTHER 
SORT CAUSING ONE OR TWO 
DIFFICULTIES AT A SANCTURARY IN 
WARWICKSHIRE THIS IS BARNEY HE IS 
LOOKS ALL RIGHT HE IS A VERY 
NAUGHTY BIRD HE KEEPS SWEARING 
NOT ONLY DOES HE SWEAR APPARENTLY 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HE TOLD THE 
MAYORESS TO GO SOMEWHERE IN NO 
UNCERTAIN TERMS AND HE WAS VERY 
RUDE TO THE VICAR AS WELL WHICH IS 
ONE THING BUT NOW HE IS TEACHING 
TWO OTHER BIRDS IN HIS CAGE TO 
SWEAR AS WELL ONE STARTED OFF 
SQUAKING SHUT UP AND THEN THE 
SWEARING STARTS IT IS ALL A 
PROBLEM BECAUSE HE IS ONLY SEVEN 
AND THEY LIVE UNTIL THEY ARE SIXTY OR

NEWSPAPER BECAUSE WE CAN'T READ OUT 
ONE OF THE WORDS CAN WE 
NO ANYWAY BOB E. MAILS US GOOD

WANTED BIRDSONG ALL DAY LONG I 
WOULD PLAY THE BIR SONG TO MY PET 
AFRICAN GREY PARROT AND HE WOULD BE

OTHER HAND HE MIGHT JUST GO TURN

SUNBEDS WE ARE BEING TOLD IT LEADS 
TO INCREASED RISK OF SKIN CANCER 
SO IS IT TIME WE PULLED THE PLUG ON 
THEM THEM IT IS SMELLY AND DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY 
DESIGN OF THE TIMES WHY COLIN AND 
JUSTIN ARE HONEST I'LL MISSION

BIRD SONG 
ITS BIRDSONG BUT NOT QUITE AS YOU 
KNOW IT BECAUSE IT IS ON THE RADIO 
THERE IS A RADIO STATION PLAYING 
BIRDSONG IT IS GETTING HALF A 
MILLION LISTENERS A DAY WE WILL 
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT IT LATER 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORE PRINCES 
WILLIAM AND HARRY HAVE SAID THEY 
AGREE WITH THE VERDICTS REACHED BY 
THE JURY AT THE DIANA INQUEST THE 
JURORS DECIDED THAT DIANA AND DODI 
FAYED WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED AND 
PINNED THE BLAME ON THEIR DRIVER 
HENRI PAUL AND THE PAPARAZZI 
PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO WERE CHASING WHEN 
THEIR CAR 
CRASHED IN PARIS TEN 
YEARS AGO BUT DODI'S FATHER 
MOHAMED AL FAYED SAYS HE IS 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE VERDICT HE 
SPOKESWOMAN TOLD BREAKFAST THAT HE 
IS CONSULTING HIS LAWYERS ABOUT 
WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT 
FOR THE INQUEST JURY THE EVIDENCE 
WAS CLEAR PRINCESS DIANA AND DODI 
FAYED WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED BUT 
NOT THROUGH CONSPIRACY THEIR 
DEATHS WERE CAUSED BY THE RECKLESS 
ACTIONS OF THEIR DRIVER HENRI PAUL 
AND THE PAPARAZZI CHASE THEIR CAR 
THROUGH THE STREETS OF PARIS 
CONCLUSIONS THAT THE PRINCESS'S 
SONS PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY 
HAVE WELCOMED THEY SAID IN HIS 
STATEMENT 
FOR MOHAMED AL FAYED THERE IS 
DISAPPOINTMENT HE STILL BELIEVES 
THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY A THEORY 
ONE FORMER ADVISER SAYS HE WAS 
ENCOURAGED TO BELIEVE 
THE PEOPLE 
AROUND HIM FED WHAT MANY OF US ARE 
VIEWED AS A FANTASY AND I THINK 
THAT THAT IS DEPLORABLE 
BUT IT 
SEEMS FROM MANY OTHERS THE TIME HAS 
COME TO MOVE ON 
I HAVE GREAT 
SYMPATHIES FOR AL FAYED L. THINK HE 
LOST HIS SON BUT I THINK IT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN SOONER WHICH IS A 
TREMENDOUS WASTE OF PUBLIC MONEY I I THINK FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY 
THINGS SHOULD MOVE ON HOW CRAZY 
AFTER TEN YEARS TO STILL BE HOPPING 
BUT IT IS GOOD THERE HAS BEEN AN 
INQUIRY HOPEFULLY IT IS FINISHED 
MOHAMED AL FAYED IS CONSIDERING HIS 
LEGAL OPTIONS BUT IT IS HARD TO 
SEEK WHAT THEY MIGHT BE NOW HIS 
CLAIMS OF CONSPIRACY HAVE BEEN 
DISCREDITED BY A JURY

YOU VERY MUCH 
THE CHILDREN'S T. V. PRESENTER MARK 
SPEIGHT HAS BEEN REPORTED MISSING 
THIS MORNING HIS FIANCEE DIED 
EARLIER THIS YEAR AFTER TAKING 
DRUGS MARK SPEIGHT FRONTED THE B. B. C. 
CHILDREN'S SHOW SMART HE FOUND HIS 
GIRLFRIEND NATASHA COLLARS AT 
THEIR LONDON FLAT IN JANUARY AND 
WAS ARRESTED BUT NO CHARGES WERE 
BROUGHT LAST WEEK AT MISS 
COLLINS'S INQUEST THE CORONER 
RECORDED A DEATH RECORDED A 
VERDICT OF DEATH BY MISADVENTURE 
BT'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE WILL STEP DOWN 
HIS POSITION WILL BE TAKEN BY IAN 
LIVINGSTONE WORKS FOR B. T.'S RETAIL 
ARM ARM A CONTROVERSIAL CULL OF BADGES IN 
WALES COULD GET THE GO AHEAD TODAY 
THE WELSH ASSEMBLY IS LIKELY TO 
SUPPORT THE MOVE AS A WAY OF 
CONTROLLING THE SPREAD OF T. B. IN 
CATTLE BUT ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS 
SAY THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE 
THAT BADGES OF RESPONSIBLE FOR 
SPREADING THE DISEASE WYRE DAVIES 
IS IN CARMARTHEN FOR US GOOD 
MORNING 
GOOD MORNING FROM A FARM MORNING IN CARMARTHENSHIRE EVERYONE AGREES 
THAT BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS IS A 
GROWING PROBLEM IN WELSH 
AGRICULTURE THIS FARM ALONE HAS 
LOST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY CATTLE TO D. B. AND 
LAST YEAR THE WELSH ASSEMBLY 
GOVERNMENT PAID OUT FIFTEEN MILLION IN 
COMPENSATION TO FARMERS WHO HAVE 
LOST ANIMALS THE PROBLEM IS WHAT 
IS TO BLAME AND WHAT IS TO BE DONE 
ABOUT IT BADGER SUPPORT ACKNOWLEDGE THERE 
IS A 
PROBLEM 
T. B. IN CATTLE BUT 
THEY SAY 
IT IS 
WRONG TO BLAME THE BADGER 
KNOWN TO MANY AS THE MID WALES 
BADGERMAN GARETH MORGAN HAS 
WATCHED AND GAIN THE TRUST OF THESE 
COMPLEX ANIMALS FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS 
THEY ARE DOING HERE WHAT YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THOUSANDS 
AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
ALL THEY 
AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS ALL THEY ARE DOING IS GOING ABOUT WHAT THEY 
HAVE ALWAYS DONE LET'S HOPE WE 
NEVER USE THEM 
THREE YEARS 
BADGERS HAVE RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY 
BEEN BLAMED FOR SPREADING 
AMONG CATTLE FARMERS 
HAVE LONG CALLED FOR WIDESPREAD 
CULL OF BADGES AND IN WALES THE 
ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO 
ANNOUNCE ITS NEXT MOVE BADGER 
GROUPS WANT MORE CATTLE TO BE 
TESTED TO ESTABLISH EXACTLY WHERE 
THE T. B. INFECTION COMES FROM BUT 
FARMERS AND MANY VETS SAY BADGER 
NUMBERS MUST BE KEPT DOWN 
AS FAST 
AS WE ARE TESTING THE CATTLE AND 
REMOVING THEM FROM THE EQUATION 
OBVIOUSLY MORE CATTLE THEN GET 
INFECTED THROUGH THE BADGERS 
COMPENSATING OSH FARMERS FOR T. B. 
INFECTED CATTLE COSTS FIFTEEN MILLION 
LAST YEAR EVERYONE AGREES IT IS A 
DISEASE THAT MUST BE KEPT UNDER 
CONTROL BUT IS ERADICATING BAD 
JUST THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT IT 
OF COURSE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE 
DEATH OF ANIMALS IS AN EMOTIVE 
ISSUE THE BADGER GROUPS SAY THAT 
TO BLAME BADGERS TO KILL BADGERS 
IS WRONG THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR 
CENTURIES FARMERS SAY THAT IF 
THESE ANIMALS DIE BECAUSE OF T. B. 
THAT IS ALSO WRONG IT IS A VERY 
POLITICALLY DIFFICULT DECISION FOR 
THE MINISTER TO TAKE 
THANKS VERY 
MUCH MUCH THE T. V. PRESENTER TRISHA GODDARD HAS 
BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER 
A LUMP WAS DISCOVERED DURING A 
ROUTINE MAMMOGRAM THREE WEEKS AGO 
SHE FIRST CAME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT 
IN AUSTRALIA AS THE FIRST BLACK T. V. 
ANCHOR SHE WILL BE ABSENT FROM HER 
CHAT SHOW FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
WE ARE THROWING AWAY FOR OH FOUR 
MILLION APPLES AND SIXTEEN MILLION 
BANANAS EVERY DAY A SURVEY OUT 
TODAY SHOWS THAT U. K. FAMILIES BEEN 
AROUND A THIRD OF ALL THE 
FOOD THEY 
BUY AND 
FORTY PER CENT 
OF IT IS FRUIT AND 
VEGETABLES THE VALUE 
OF ALL 
THAT 
WASTE IS THOUGHT TO BE ABOUT THREE 
BILLION THAT'S A LOT OF APPLES 
LOOKING AT THE FRONT PAGES OF THE 
PAPERS A LOT OF THEM ARE 
CONCENTRATING ON THE DIANA INQUEST 
HERE IS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE 
EXPRESS A ONE OFF BE KILLED BY THE 
CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT DRIVING OF 
HENRI PAUL AND PURSUING PAPARAZZI 
THE DAILY MAIL ASKED THE QUESTION 
NOW END THE DIANA MYTHS SAME STORY 
ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TELEGRAPH 
BUT MUCH MORE DISPLAYED WITH 
PICTURES OF THE TWO PRINCES AND 
THEIR MOTHER AND ALSO THE TIMES 
THEY HAVE AN INTERESTING PICTURE 
HERE YOU MAY RECOGNISE IT THE 
DIANA JULIE BLAMES THE USUAL 
SUSPECTS THAT IS A POLICE LINE UP 
OF THE PAPARAZZI WHO WERE TAKEN 
INTO CUSTODY AFTER THE CRASH THAT 
KILLED 
DIANA PRINCESS 
OF WALES AND 
DODI FAYED 
LET'S GET VIEWS ON THIS FROM THE 
FORMER EDITOR OF THE NEWS OF THE 
WORLD AND THE EDITOR OF THE SUN 
I SEEM TO REMEMBER JUST ABOUT A 
WEEK OR TWO BEFORE THERE WERE BIG 
SPLASHES IN THE SUNDAY PAPERS 
POSSIBLY YOURS AS WELL OF DIANA 
AND DODI ON THE YACHT IS THAT 
RIGHT 
I ACTUALLY TURNED THIS DOWN RIGHT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE 
INTRUSIVE AT THE TIME THERE WERE 
BIG SPLASHES AND A PICTURE OF DIANA 
ON THE FRONT PAGE GUARANTEED A 
CIRCULATION RISE 
THE INVOLVEMENT 
OF THE PAPARAZZI IN THIS UNLAWFUL 
KILLING VERDICT DO YOU THINK IT 
WAS FAIR 
I DO 
THINK IT IS FAIR L. THINK THE NOTION THAT THEY ARE 
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE IS WRONG THE 
FIGURE WAS A COMBINATION OF FEEL 
FOR THINGS THERE WAS A VORACIOUS 
APPETITE FOR THESE PICTURES AND 
SOME NEWSPAPERS TO HAVE TO TAKE 
SOME RESPONSIBILITY 
BUT DIANA ALSO COURTED THE MEDIA 
AND LOVED ATTENTION BUT IN THE END 
THE ROYAL FAMILY HAVE BEEN 
WITHDRAWING SECURITY FROM HER SO 
SHE WAS IN THE 
BACK OF 
THE 
WITHOUT 
A SEATBELT 
AND WITH AN 
ERRATIC DRIVER 
ARTHUR YOU TOOK 
SOME OF THOSE CLASSIC PICTURES 
OFFER VERY MUCH SET PIECES DG 
COURT THE MEDIA 
SHE DID INDEED AND 
SHE DID IT SOMETIMES FOR GOOD 
REASONS THE YEAR SHE DIED SHE WAS 
GOING ROUND THE WORLD TRYING TO GET 
LANDMINES BANNED THERE WERE THIRTY OR 
FORTY OF US WITH HER AND SENDING OUT 
THE MESSAGE SO SHE DID DO THAT 
MANY TIMES SHE USED TO US BUT IT 
WAS A GOOD THING TO BE USED SHE 
WAS A PRETTY 
WOMAN AS 
BILL SAID 
SHE SOLD THE PAPER NO SECRET ABOUT 
THAT AND NO 
OTHER MEMBER 
OF 
ROYAL FAMILY HAS COME ANYWHERE NEAR 
SINCE AS FAR AS BEING POPULAR WITH 
THE PUBLIC L. LOVE DIANA SHE WAS 
GOOD FOR US GOOD FOR OUR BUSINESS 
THESE PAPARAZZI 
THE DIFFICULTY 
WITH THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE LIKE 
ARTHUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL 
PHOTOGRAPHERS BEHAVE IN A PROPER 
WAY IT IS THIS RENEGADE BAND OF 
PAPARAZZI THAT ARE THE DIFFICULT 
ISSUE IT IS HARD TO IGNORE THOSE 
PICTURES AS A NEWSPAPER EDITOR 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GREAT PICTURES 
AND WERE SELLING NEWSPAPERS HAVE HAVE THE LESSONS BEEN LEARNT 
I THINK 
THEY HAVE BEEN LET IN SOME WAYS 
THERE HAVE BEEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN 
THE PALACE AND SOME OF THE 
BUT THEN YOU SEE THE PACK OUTSIDE 
KATE MEDDLESOME'S HOUSE 
TEN YEARS 
LATER AND STILL KATE MIDDLETON 
COULD ONE DAY BE OUR QUEEN IF SHE 
COULD MARRY PRINCE WILLIAM 
IS GOING TO IT NOW AGAIN AND 
CHASING HER THROUGH THE STREETS IN 
CARS WHEN ARE 
THEY GO 
IN TO LEARN 
THIS COULD HAPPEN AGAIN HAVING HAVING SAID THAT IT WAS A LETHAL 
COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES IF 
HENRI PAUL HAD NOT BEEN OVER THE 
LIMIT IF HENRI PAUL HAD BEEN A 
TRAIN CHAUFFEUR AND BODYGUARD AND 
IF HE HAD NOT BEEN DRIVING FAST 
AND IF DIANA HAD FAST WEARING A SEATBELT BUT I DO THINK 
NEWSPAPERS HAVE TO TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY BUT 
THINK OF 
BODIES HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 
WHEN A PACK OF PHOTOGRAPHERS IS 
CHOOSING SOMEBODY DOWN THE STREET 
THEY SHOULD BE ARRESTED THEY 
SHOULD 
BE SEVERE 
PENALTIES BECAUSE 
IT IS PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK YOU 
SEE IT HAPPEN 
OVER AND 
PEOPLE 
BEING CHASED 
DOWN THE STREET 
THAT IS WRONG 
YOU ARE SAYING THE 
NEWSPAPER EDITORS PEOPLE ARE 
PRINTING THEM OR THEY WOULD NOT BE 
CHASING THEM DOWN THE STEEP THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT THE EDITOR QUESTIONS THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES IN 
WHICH A 
PICTURE 
WAS TAKEN 
IF YOU 
DON'T RUN IT AND 
EVERYBODY ELSE 
DOES IT IS 
DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT IN THIS 
COUNTRY THERE 
WERE MANY 
PICTURES 
WE 
DID NOT 
RUN 
AND THEY 
WERE THEN 
COMING BACK HERE TO OTHER METHODS 
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION 
WHAT'S THE FEELING AMONGST ROYAL 
PHOTOGRAPHERS LIKE YOURSELF DID IT 
KILL IT A BIT FOR YOU AFTER IT 
HAPPENED 
AFTER DIANA DIED YEAH HAPPENED THE WHOLE THING JUST WENT REALLY 
DOWN AS I SAID THERE'S NOBODY TO 
REPLACE HER AND THE ROYAL JOB IN 
FACT WASN'T THE SAME AFTERWARDS 
AND SHE WAS JUST IT AND 
UNFORTUNATELY PHIL SHE ASKED HER 
POLICEMEN TO GO THAT WAS THE THING 
IF SHE HADN'T HAVE DONE SHE'D 
PROBABLY STILL BE ALIVE L. BELIEVE 
THAT I BELIEVE A PROPER SCOTLAND 
YARD POLICEMAN WOULD HAVE PUT 
EVERYTHING IN ORDER THAT NIGHT HE 
WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY MADE THE 
DRIVER SLOW DOWN 
THAT'S WHAT KEN 
WOLF SAID 
HE WOULD HAVE MADE HIM 
SLOW DOWN AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU 
THINK THE SPEED HE WAS GOING I 
WENT TO THAT TUNNEL WITH THE JURY 
I WAS THE ROTAED PHOTOGRAPHER FOR 
THAT I SAW THE SPEED THE CARS GO 
IN THERE THE WAY THEY HIT THAT 
BUMP AS THEY GO IN THERE AND IF YOU 
WERE GOING ABSOLUTELY AT THE 
BOAST OF TIME WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING 
NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL 
BUT GOING ERRATIC AT A SPEED LIKE 
THAT WITH TOO MUCH ALCOHOL IN YOUR 
SYSTEM JUST TOO DANGEROUS THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN TO TALK 
TO US STILL TO COME ON THE 
PROGRAMME THIS MORNING 
GOING UP IN THE WORLD THE MEN WHO 
WANT TO LOOK THEIR PARTNERS IN THE 
EYE BY SPORTING HIGH HEELS 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT FROM BAD 
TO GOOD SERVICE THE COMPUTER RUN 
RESTAURANT AND THE ONLY TIP YOU 
WOULD NEED IS DON'T FORGET TO PLUG 
IT IN 
ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO 
IT'S ABOUT MOVING FORWARD FOR THE 
BEST ABOUT 
HOUSE OF HORRORS BEWARE IF YOUR 
HOME IS HIDING A CRIME AGAINST 
DESIGN THEN COLIN AND JUSTIN MAY 
TRACK YOU DOWN 
FIRST THEY NEED A FEW BIN LINERS I 
WOULD THINK IN THAT PLACE EXACTLY EXACTLY TIDY UP 
HOW TIDY IS CAROL'S 
GARDEN NEAT AS A PIN I SHOULD 
THINK THINK THE BLUE PETER ONE IS ANYWAY IT'S 
CHILLY FOR MANY OF US IT'S A COLD 
START TO THE DAY TEMPERATURES 
STILL BELOW OR AROUND FREEZING 
FROST FOR SOME AND MIST AND FOG 
PATCHES AROUND BUT THIS SHOULDN'T 
PRESENT TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM ON 
THE RADAR PICTURE THAT GOES BACK TWELVE 
HOURS WE HAVE A DISTINCTIVE BAND OF 
RAIN FROM NORTHERN IRELAND THE 
NORTH OF WALES LINCOLNSHIRE 
THROUGH THE DAY THAT'LL TURN MORE 
SHOWERY SNOW TO HIGHER GROUND IN 
THE EAST AND IN EASTERN SCOTLAND 
SNOW ON HIGHER GROUND EVEN ON 
HIGHER GROUNDS A HEAVIER LEVELS 
AROUND ABERDEENSHIRE FOR THE NORTH 
OF ENGLAND A GORGEOUS START TO THE 
DAY WE RUN INTO THAT BAND OF RAIN 
WE HAVE JUST MENTIONED WITH THE 
SOUTH SNOW TO HIGHER GROUND BUT 
AGAIN A BEAUTIFUL START TO THE DAY 
COLD WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MIST 
HERE AND THERE WE HAVE SHOWERS 
VERY CLOSE TO THE COASTS OF BOTH 
DEVON AND CORNWALL INLANDS IT'S 
SUNNY BY NINE HUNDRED THE RAIN BAND WILL 
SHOW ITS HAND ACROSS NORTHERN WALES 
NORTHERN IRELAND STARTS OFF BRIGHT 
WHEN THAT RAIN BAND MOVES AWAY THE 
CLOUD WILL BUILD ACROSS CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN SCOTLAND HERALDING THE 
ARRIVAL OF A BAND OF RAIN WHICH IS 
SINKING SOUTH THROUGH THE DAY 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY WE'LL SEE 
SHOWERS DEVELOP BUT THERE WILL BE 
GOOD SUNNY BREAKS IN BETWEEN SOME 
OF THE SHOWERS WILL BE HEAVY BUT 
THEY'LL TEND TO DIE AWAY THIS 
EVENING OVERNIGHT A BAND OF RAIN 
WHICH IS CURRENTLY ACROSS SCOTLAND 
WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH SOUTH 
WEAKENING AND END UP AS NOT MUCH 
MORE THAN A BAND OF CLOUD COLD ON 
EITHER SIDE OF IT WITH A TOUCH OF 
FROST IT 
MEAN A BEAUTIFUL 
START TO THE DAY FOR MANY PARTS 
TOMORROW MORNING WITH SOME SUNSHINE 
HOWEVER LIKE TODAY WE'LL SEE 
FURTHER SHOWERS DEVELOP AND LIKE 
TODAY TOO SOME OF THEM WILL BE 
HEAVY IN NATURE STILL SOME SNOW 
OVER THE SCOTTISH HILLS 
TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM ABOUT SEVEN 
IN THE NORTH TO FOURTEEN IN THE SOUTH 
AND THE OUTLOOK REMAINS UNSETTLED 
THE WINTRY MIX OF WEATHER WE HAVE 
HAD RECENTLY DIMINISHING AND THE 
TEMPERATURES A WEE BIT 
DISAPPOINTING FOR THE TIME OF THE 
YEAR THAT'S HOW IT'S LOOKING BACK 
TO YOU TWO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO 
BE BACK OUT THERE OF COURSE 
BECAUSE CHRIS COLLINS THE BLUE 
PETER GARDEN WILL BE TALKING TO 
US ABOUT BIRDSONG IN THE RADIO 
LET'S GET MORE ABOUT MISSING 
CHILDREN'S T. V. PRESENTER MARK 
SPEIGHT YVONNE MURRAY IS HERE WITH 
MORE DETAILS MARK SPEIGHT WHAT'S 
KNOWN ABOUT HIM GOING MISSING HE HE WAS LAST SEEN YESTERDAY MORNING 
AROUND NINE THIRTY A M. WHEN HE WAS DROPPED 
OFF AT WOOD GREEN STATION IN NORTH 
LONDON HE WAS DUE TO MEET A FRIEND 
AT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 
INKOVENT GARDEN AND DIDN'T SHOW UP 
SO FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAVE RAISED 
THE ALARM POLICE SAY THEY ARE VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT HIM AND HE IS 
BEING TALKED ABOUT AS A VERY 
VULNERABLE PERSON 
YES VERY 
VULNERABLE BECAUSE HIS FIANCEE 
NATASHA COLLINS DIED EARLIER THIS 
YEAR 
SHE DIED 
IN THE COUPLE'S HOME 
YEAR IN SAINT JOHN'S WOOD IN LONDON THIS YEAR SHE WAS FOUND DEAD I THINK 
YOU'LL REMEMBER IN A SCALDING BATH 
SHE HAD BURNS TO HER BODY AND IN 
THE INQUEST IT WAS FOUND THAT SHE 
HAD BEEN TAKING COCAINE THE 
CORONER RECORDED A VERDICT LAST 
WEEK IN THE INQUEST OF DEATH BY 
MISADVENTURE AND IT'S ALSO WORTH 
MENTIONING THAT MARK SPEIGHT WAS 
ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF MURDER 
ORIGINALLY BUT HE WAS RELEASED 
WITHOUT CHARGE 
YVONNE THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH 
FRESH WARNINGS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHO USE SUNBEDS ARE GREATLY 
INCREASING THEIR RISK OF DEVELOPING 
SKIN CANCER 
YES ALISON HARPER IS AT A TANNING 
SALON IN WINCHESTER TO TELL US A 
LITTLE BIT MORE GOOD MORNING 
ALISON ALISON GOOD MORNING HERE WE ARE THIS IS 
WHAT CAUSES ALL THE FUSS NOW 
INCREDIBLY WE KNOW ABOUT THE RISKS 
OF TANNING AND THE DAMAGE IT DOES 
TO OUR SKIN BUT THE LATEST 
RESEARCH FROM CANCER RESEARCH U. K. 
SUGGESTS THAT EIGHTY TWO PER CENT OF PEOPLE UNDER 
THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE HAVE USED A SUNBED 
LIKE THIS AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
DONE THEY'VE INCREASED THEIR RISK 
OF SKIN CANCER BY SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT WE ARE A 
NATION WHO LIKES TO HAVE A LITTLE 
BIT OF COLOUR ONE IN THREE ONE 
IN FOUR WOMEN HAVE USED SUNBEDS 
ONE IN THREE MEN HAVE AS WELL BUT 
IS IT TIME TO CHANGE FROM RAYS TO 
SPRAYS IN MOMENT WE'LL BE 
TALKING TO THE SALON OWNER HERE IN 
WINCHESTER ABOUT RESPONSIBLE 
TANNING BUT FIRST LET'S HEAR FROM 
A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD WHO GOES AND USES A 
SUNBED EVERY WEEK 
I HAVE USED THEM SINCE I WAS SIXTEEN 
HIYA HIYA I LOVE GOING ON SUNBEDS BECAUSE YOU 
GET A NATURAL TAN THERE IS NOTHING 
BETTER THAN TAN BECAUSE IT MAKES 
YOU LOOK HEALTHY YEAH I THINK 
EVERYONE WANTS TO LOOK HEALTHY IF 
I'M FEELING QUITE PASTY I THINK 
I'LL GO ON THE SUNBEDS ABOUT TWO 
THREE TIMES A WEEK REALISTICALLY 
I SHOULD GO ONCE A WEEK I'LL GO 
FOR ABOUT FIVE SIX MINUTES THAT'S 
USUALLY ENOUGH 
I THINK ANY SUNBED IS DANGEROUS 
BUT IT'S THE PRICE WE PAY TO LOOK 
HEALTHY AND TANNED L. REMEMBER WHEN 
I WAS SIXTEEN I DID GO ON ONE FOR ABOUT 
TWENTY FIVE MINUTES NOW IT'S MORE MONITORED 
SO ESPECIALLY PEOPLE IN THEIR TEENS 
THEY DON'T JUST PUT LOADS OF 
TOKENS IN THE MACHINE AND THEY'RE 
ON THE SUNBED RISKING THEMSELVES 
NOW IT'S A LOT BETTER 
THIS SALON THEY'RE VERY GOOD THE 
BED'S ALWAYS YOU KNOW MONITORED 
THEY KEEP A RECORD OF HOW OFTEN 
YOU'RE ON THE BED AND THERE IS 
SOMEONE COMING IN SAYING I WANT 
FIFTEEN MINUTES THEY'LL SAY NO LOOK 
SEVEN MINUTES FOR YOUR SKIN SO SO THERE ARE LOADS OF THINGS YOU CAN 
DO YOU CAN USE A SUNBED OR LOTS OF 
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS FOR GIVING YOU A 
TAN WITHOUT HAVING TO GO UNDER THE 
RAYS THEMSELVES WITH ME IS LYNDSAY 
SHELDON FROM THE SALON HERE IN 
WINCHESTER IS THERE EVER A POINT 
WHERE YOU SAY TO SOMEBODY NO YOU 
CAN'T USE A SUNBED 
YES OF COURSE 
IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR USE OF TANNING 
RESPONSIBLE THERE ARE A FEW 
OCCASION WHEN IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT 
AND PROPER FOR SOMEBODY TO USE A 
SUNBED GENERALLY SPEAKING WITHIN 
INDUSTRY GUIDELINES WE STICK TO THE 
FACT THAT PEOPLE UNDER SIXTEEN SHOULDN'T 
USE A SUNBED PEOPLE WHO ARE 
PREGNANT SHOULD BE CAREFUL USING 
SUNBEDS AND CERTAINLY SOMEBODY 
THAT I FELT WAS USING SUNBEDS FAR 
TOO MUCH WOULD HAVE THE BENEFIT OF 
MY ADVICE TO MAYBE DESIST OR BRING 
THEIR TIME IN THE SUNBED BACK A 
LITTLE BIT IN ORDER THAT WE CAN 
PROMOTE IT SAFELY AND RESPONSIBLY 
SO YOU FOLLOW VOLUNTARY CODE OF 
CONDUCT PUT DOWN BY THE SUNBED 
ASSOCIATION BUT DO YOU THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE STRONGER LEGISLATION SO 
PEOPLE DO TAN RESPONSIBLY BECAUSE 
THERE ARE SOME SALONS WHICH ARE NOT 
STAFFED AT ALL PEOPLE CAN JUST PUT 
MONEY IN AND USE SUNBED FOR AS 
LONG AS THEY LIKE 
BROADLY SPEAKING 
I WOULD WELCOME LEGISLATION BUT 
ONLY IF IT'S DONE IN THE CORRECT 
FASHION THERE'S LOT OF 
SENSATIONALIST CONJECTURE WHEN IT 
COMES TO SUNBEDS AND YOU HAVE TO BE 
CAREFUL NOT TO INTRODUCE ANYTHING 
TOO DRACONIAN THAT WOULD CAUSE THE 
INDUSTRY PROBLEMS THE GUIDELINES 
GIVE US THE RIGHT SET OF RULES TO 
USE AND PEOPLE CAN USE IT IN A 
SAFE WAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
JOINING US THIS MORNING SO THE 
DEBATE ABOUT SUN TANNING AND 
WHETHER IT'S SAFE OR NOT IS SET TO 
CONTINUE FOR SOME TIME TO COME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALSO DEBATE 
THIS MORNING ABOUT RETIREMENT AND 
THE RETIREMENT CLIFF EDGE BECAUSE 
THE GOVERNMENT IS WARNING PEOPLE 
POSSIBLY TO PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR 
RETIREMENT BECAUSE IT CAN BE A 
SHARP DROP HALF OF PENSIONERS 
SAY THEY WEREN'T HAPPY 
ROGER SMITH SAYS I WILL RETIRE 
FROM MY RETAIL BUSINESS THIS YEAR 
BUT STARTING MY PART TIME JOB 
THAT'S SINGING ALREADY HAVE 
FEW BOOKINGS AND NEVER HAPPIER

I HAVE NEVER WORN THEM YET THEM THEM BEING STACKS HIGH HEEL 
HOW HIGH 
ARE YOUR YOUR HEELS MEN ARE 
STEPPING UP THEIR GAME WHEN IT 
COMES TO FASHIONABLE FOOT WEAR 
NICOLAS SARKOZY WAS SEEN WEARING 
STACKED HEELS APPARENTLY PIN 
STRIPED BUSINESSMEN ARE SNAPPING UP 
BROINGS AND LOAFERS WITH HEELS OF 
UP TO FIVE CENTIMETRES ONE STYLE 
OFFERS THE WEARER BOATER POSTURE 
AND FEELINGS OF INCREASED POWER AND 
SECURITY WE TOOK A PAIR ON TO THE 
STREET TO FIND OUT HOW MANY MEN 
WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE IN HEELS 
HIGH HEELS NOT FOR ME CERTAINLY 
NOT 
I'M NOT INTO THAT STUFF 
IF IT NOT MAKES ME TALL I'M UP FOR IT 
IF IT 
WASN'T COMFORTABLE I WOULDN'T WEAR 
IT IT IS VERY DAVID BRENT IN THE 
OFFICE NOT REALLY MY CUP OF TEA 
NO I CAN'T DO THAT WHY 
THEY ARE WHY A BIT FEMININE FOR ME 
THEY ARE 
HORRIBLE UGLY 
HORRIBLE TO BE 
HONEST THEY ARE TOO FEMININE IT'S IT'S GREAT WHEN HIGH HEELS WHATEVER 
FLOATS YOUR BOAT GO FOR IT 
WHY DO 
MEN FEEL THE NEED TO RISE ABOVE 
THEIR FRIENDS AND WORK COLLEAGUES 
WE ARE JOINED BY FASHION EXPERT 
DAVID WATERS AND JILL KENTON IF WE 
LOOK AT YOUR SHOES THOSE ARE 
PLATFORMS YOU WOULD GO FOR HEIGHT 
I AM ONLY FIVE FOOT TWO IT MAKES 
ME FEEL MORE IN CONTROL MORE 
IMPORTANT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I 
FEEL 
WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOUR FEEL SHOES WHAT DO YOU FEEL IF YOU SAW 
A MAN WEARING GREAT BIG STACKS ARE 
YOU CONVINCED BY THEM 
WHAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT IS MORE OF THE IT'S 
NOT LIKE A WEDGE IT IS THE SOLE 
IT'S BECOME LARGINGER AND HIGHER 
GIVING THE MAN AM I RIGHT EVERY EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS IF YOU FEEL 
VERTICALLY CHALLENGED IN SOME WAY 
WHY 
HANG ON A SECOND WHY DO WHY WOMEN WEAR HEELS IN THE FIRST PLACE 
BECAUSE THEY ARE SHORTER THAN MEN 
AND THEY WANT TO MAKE THEMSELVES 
MORE ALLURING YOU PUT YOURSELF IN 
A DIFFERENT POSTURE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY FOR ME I NEVER WEAR FLATS L. DON'T 
KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO WEAR FLATS 
BUT WHY DO MEN NEED TO DO THAT I I DON'T THINK ALL MEN DO SOME MEN 
WHO WANT TO HAVE THE OPTION OF 
BEING AN INCH TALLER THAN GOD 
INTENDED THEN WHY NOT 
DOES IT 
MAKE THEM FEEL DIFFERENT IT IT PROBABLY GIVES THEM MORE CONFIDENT 
SOME OF THESE YOUNGER GUYS 
INTERVIEWED YESTERDAY WERE SAYING 
THE SAME THING WHY DENY YOURSELF 
THE OPTION WHY DENY YOURSELF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF FEELING CONFIDENT 
ALSO IT IMPROVES YOUR POSTURE IF 
YOU THINK ABOUT IT US WOMEN WHEN 
WE WEAR HEELS WE STAND BETTER OUR 
BOOBS GO FORWARD FOR A GUY YOU 
FEEL MORE EMPOWERED 
IF I NOTICED 
SOMEBODY I WAS CHATTING TO WAS 
WEARING THEM I COULD NOT TAKE THEM 
SERIOUSLY 
THEY DISGUISE THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY VERY WELL THERE IS A NEW STYLE OF 
SHOE SO THEY LOOK COMPLETELY 
CONVENTIONAL BUT INSIDE THEY ARE 
GIVING HEIGHT 
RUSSELL BRAND HE IS 
SIX FOOT TWO AND AND WEARS THESE 
CUBAN HEELS THAT ADD ON AN INCH 
AND A HALF 
THERE ARE A LOT OF AND A HALF THINGS YOU COULD DISCUSS ABOUT HIM 
POSSIBLY A QUESTION MARK OVER 
HONESTY WITH THIS WOMEN YOU EXPECT 
TO WEAR HEELS AND IF YOU ARE A MAN 
AND YOU ARE WEARING WHATEVER YOU 
ARE PORTRAYING YOURSELF AS 
SOMETHING YOU ARE NOT 
IT IS 
DISGUISE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WEAR 
YOUR TROUSERS UP TO HERE IT IS 
DISGUISED UNDERNEATH THE TROUSER 
LEG MEN PROBABLY DON'T EVEN NOTICE 
THEY ARE BUYING IT AND IT IS THAT 
LITTLE BIT HIGHER 
BACK TO THE 
PRESIDENT AND MA DAMN SARKOZY SHE 
WAS WEARING FLAT SHOES AND HE 
WASN'T WAS THAT IMPORTANT THE WAY 
THEY WERE SEEN TOGETHER 
I THINK IT 
PROBABLY IS FOR A LOT OF MEN WHO 
MAYBE AREN'T PARTICULARLY TALL THE 
IDEA THAT YOU ADD A BIT OF HEIGHT 
YOU MIGHT END UP WITH SOMEONE LIKE 
CARLA BRUNI IT IS AN INCENTIVE 
SILVIO BERLUSCONI WEARS THESE SHOES 
AS WELL THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT 
POLITICIANS PERHAPS 
ONE PAIR 
OFFERING IMPROVED POSTURE BETTER 
TROUSER LINE AND INCREASED POWER 
AND SECURITY FIVE CENTIMETRES 
THERE'S A LOT 
YES I AM FIVE TWO 
I HAVE HAD A SHORT BOYFRIEND WHEN 
I HAVE MY HEELS ON WE ARE THE SAME 
HEIGHT WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR HEELS 
OFF YOU ARE SHORTER YOU WANT TO 
FEEL YOU ARE TALLER L. DON'T LIKE 
BEING FIVE TWO THERE ARE SHORT 
MEN OUT THERE THAT WANT IMPROVED 
HEIGHT AND IT PROVES YOUR GAIT 
YOUR WALK 
SHOULD YOU CARRY A 
WARNING LABEL AT LEAST SAYING I 
MAY LOOK FIVE FOOT TEN BUT I'M ONLY

BRAS AND PUMP UP BRAS

SHE'S A VERY POSITIVE PERSON THERE 
IS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT PSTIVELY 
THAT HOSPITAL FIGHT IT 
ZSH THAT HELPS FIGHT IT WE WISH 
TRISHA THE VERY BEST USUALLY WHEN 
WE TUNE INTO THE RADIO WE WANT TO 
LISTEN TO THE NEWS OR MAYBE SOME 
MUSIC BUT HOW ABOUT LITTLE BIT 
OF THIS 
IT'S FLYING TO THE TOP OF THE 
CHARTS FOR ONE RADIO STATION UP TO 
HALF A MILLION LISTENERS EVERY WEEK 
ARE CHOOSING TO TUNE INTO THESE 
SUTTING SOUNDS 
IT BROADCASTS NOTHING BUT BIRD SONG 
FROM SIX IN THE MORNING TILL 
MIDNIGHT IT'S BECOME THE SURPRISE 
HIT OF THE DIGITAL RADIO WORLD 
TWO YEAR OLD NATALIA AND HER 
BROTHER ARE HUGE FANS ZM 
WHE WE 
TURNED IT ON THEY GIVE A BIG 
CHORUS OF BIRDIES BIRDIES AND GET 
BACK TO EATING AND THROWING THEIR 
FOOD AROUND BUT THEY REALLY KNOW 
IT'S THERE AND ASK FOR IT EVERY 
MORNING 
THE RECORDING WAS MADE MORNING ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO BY QUENTIN 
HOWARD IN HIS BACK GARDEN IN 
WILTSHIRE TODAY HE IS THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF A NUMBER OF RADIO 
STATIONS WHEN ONE OF THEM WENT 
BUST HE DECIDED TO PUT OUT THE 
BIRD SONG INSTEAD 
PEOPLE LIKE IT 
THEY LOVE IT IN FACT THEY WRITE TO 
US AND TELL US THEY PUT IT ON THE 
RADIO AND LEAVE IT ON ALL DAY LONG 
IN THE BACKGROUND WE HAVE LETTERS 
FROM PRISONERS IN JAIL WHO HEAR IT 
ALL DAY LONG 
WHAT DO PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE THINK 
IT'S QUITE A PEACEFUL SOUND 
RELAXING 
WOOD PIGEONS 
A LOT OF RELAXING TWITTERING GOING ON 
A CROW MAYBE MAYBE SOMETHING YOU WOULD LISTEN TO ON 
HOLIDAY OR SOMETHING 
THAT IS A 
THRUSH 
THE KIND OF STUFF I LISTEN THRUSH TO WHEN I AM DOING MEDITATION 
WOULD YOU LISTEN TO IT 
I DON'T 
THINK I WOULD REALLY 
BUT THOSE 
WHO HAVE BEEN MESMERISED BY IT SAY 
THE APPEAL IS OBVIOUS 
I AM SURE 
PEOPLE REMEMBER TIMES WHEN THEY 
HAVE BEEN IN WOODLANDS OR THE 
COUNTRYSIDE LISTENING TO A 
FANTASTIC ARRAY OF BIRD SONG AND IT 
MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD REMINDS THEM 
OF SPRING AND SUMMER THEIR PAST 
ALL THOSE THINGS IT IS A FANTASTIC 
THING 
BUT EVEN THOUGH THE BIRD THING SONG CHANNEL HAS SENT THE LISTENING 
PUBLIC ALL OF A TWITTER IT COULD 
SOON BE HAVING ITS WINGS CLIPPED 
WHY IT'S NOT MAKING ANY MONEY 
HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE TUNE IN AND 
THERE ARE RECKONED TO BE HALF A 
MILLION A WEEK WITH NO ADVERTISING 
REVENUE IT WON'T LAST THE BIRD 
SONG CHANNEL SURVIVES FOR THE 
MOMENT ON A WING AND A PRAYER 
ONE MAN WHO HEARS A LOT OF BIRDSONG 
WITHOUT TURNING ON THE RADIO IS 
GARDENER CHRIS COLLINS WHO IS HERE 
YOU LOOK AFTER THE BLUE PETER 
GARDEN WE LOVE THOSE BIRDS THIS THIS IS A REALLY GOOD TIME OF YEAR TO 
LISTEN TO THEM IT IS NICE TO HEAR 
THEM ON THE RADIO BUT THEY ARE 
GETTING ACTIVE L. WAS LOOKING OUT 
MY FRENCH WINDOWS YESTERDAY AND 
THERE WERE CHAFFINCHES THAT GET 
RATHER AMOROUS FEATHERED FLIRTING

YOU ALMOST WAKE UP L. LIKE IT WE 
LIVE MANIC LIVES WE ARE ALWAYS 
BUSY THEY TAKE YOU OUT OF THAT FOR 
A MINUTE OR TWO ROBIN IS ANOTHER 
CLASSIC THEY WILL LITERALLY SIT 
ALMOST ON THE END OF YOUR SPADE 
WHEN YOU ARE A GARDENER YOU GET A 
VERY CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP 
IS THERE ANYTHING PARTICULAR YOU DO 
TO ENCOURAGE BIRDS INTO THE 
GARDENS 
IN THE WINTER I WILL PUT GARDENS FOOD YOU GET COCONUT SHELLS IN 
THE SPRING AN SUMMER THEY CAN 
PROBABLY COPE AND PUT OUT WATER BUT

READING THE PAPER GREAT THING TO 
HAVE ON IN THE BACKGROUND

AN AMATEUR RECORDING MADE FOR AN 
AMATEUR DRAMATIC PRODUCTION TWENTY 
YEARS AGO IT IS ON A TWENTY MINUTE 
LOOP AND PEOPLE LISTEN TO IT I I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ALMOST MED 
TATEING ABOUT IT L. FIND IT 
RELAXING I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE 
LIKE IT 
THE DIFFICULTY BEING A 
RADIO STATION IS YOU CAN'T REALLY 
INTERRUPT THE INTELIRD SONG FOR AN 
ADVERT 
I DON'T NOW IT WORKS OUT ADVERT HOW IT'LL FUNDSELF IT WOULDN'T 
BEND IN 
IT MAY HAVE A LIMITED 
FUTURE IT WORKS FOR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE CECILIA SAID SHE HAD AN M. R. I. 
SCAN AND TOOK ON A C. D. OF BIRDSONG 
AND LISTENING TO IT RELAXED HER AND 
SHE WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY 
IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES 
AGAIN IT 
IS MED TATEIVE IT WOULD BE FUN TO 
LEARN THEM L. DON'T KNOW THAT MANY 
BUT I'M SURE IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE 
OUT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AND SAYING

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE FILM ONCE 
YOU MAY REMEMBER WE FEATURED THE 
FEW MONTHS AGO IT WAS MADE ON A 
TINY BUDGET AND WENT ON TO TAKE 
MILLIONS AT THE BOX OFFICE AND AN 
OSCAR THE STORY OF AN IMPOVERISHED 
IRISH BUSKER AND HIS RELATIONSHIP 
WITH A YOUNG POLISH GIRL 
GLEN HANSARD WROTE THE SONGS ON THE 
FILM FALLING SLOWY IS BEING 
RELEASED AS A SINGLE FIRST LET'S 
LISTEN TO IT WE WILL TALK TO HIM 
IN A MOMENT 
FOR YOU HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH 
AND WARED WITH YOURSELF 
IT'S TIME THAT YOU WON 
TAKE THIS SINKING BOAT 
AND PUT IT AND POINT IT HOME 
WE'VE STILL GOT TIME 
RAISE YOUR HOPEFUL VOICE 
YOU HAD A CHOICE 
YOU'VE MADE IT NOW 
FALLING SLOWLY 
SING YOUR MELODY 
I'LL SING ALONG 
AND THE MAN IS HERE NOW ABSOLUTELY 
FABULOUS GLEN I COULD LISTEN TO 
IT ALL DAY 
THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE 
TO YOU YOU WERE A HUMBLE DUBLIN 
MUSICIAN NOW INTERNATIONAL 
SUPERSTAR 
YEAH A REAL IDIOT BUT SUPERSTAR BUT THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME YOU WON 
THE OSCAR A WHILE AGO BUT YOU 
HAVEN'T BEEN BACK BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
BEEN SO BUSY IS THAT RIGHT 
I DID 
SOMETHING THAT I I DID SOMETHING 
I GUESS ALMOST IN REACTION TO 
HAVING WON THAT WE GOT A PHONECALL 
IN NOVEMBER SAYING WE WERE SHORT 
LISTED AND WE WERE TOTALLY SHOCKED 
BY IT AND THEN TO GET THE 
NOMINATION WAS ANOTHER AND THEN 
TO GO THERE AND BE PART OF IT AND 
SEE IT I FELT LIKE A PLUMBER AT A 
FLOWER SHOW FEELING DISCONNECTED 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME ENJOYING IT I 
BROUGHT MY MOTHER AND MARKETA 
BROUGHT HER MOTHER WHEN IT WAS 
FINISHED I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THIS 
IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS IN YOUR 
LIFE THAT'S SO HUGE L. DIDN'T KNOW 
HOW TO COME DOWN L. CHECKED MYSELF 
INTO A COURSE L. STUDIED FILM 
THERE WAS A FILM CAMERA THAT I LOVE 
CALLED AN ARIFLEX FILM L. DID A 
COURSE ON FILM MAKING FOR A MONTH 
WHERE WAS THAT 
IN NEW YORK L. 
FOUND MYSELF THE DAY AFTER THE 
OSCARS IN A CLASSROOM IN NEW YORK 
SITTING THERE WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER 
PEOPLE LISTENING TO SOME GUY WITH A 
BLACKBOARD AND IT WAS LIKE THIS 
IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED TO DO TO 
GROUND MYSELF AFTER THAT 
AT WHAT 
POINT DID YOU TELL THEM YOU JUST 
HAPPENED TO HAVE WON AN OSCAR A FEW 
DAYS BEFORE 
THERE WAS AN 
UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE 
WAS AREN'T YOU I WAS LIKE 
YEAH IT WAS A FUNNY ONE BUT 
GREAT FOR ME TO DO AFTER SUCH A 
HUGE PINNACLE 
YOU DIDN'T DIRECT 
THE FILM BUT YOU WOULD HAVE LEARNED 
ENOUGH FROM FILM MAKING AND THE 
SECRET OF IT WAS WHAT SIMPLICITY 
YOU SHOT IT IN TWO WEEKS ON VERY 
LITTLE MONEY AND IT HAD A TERRIFIC 
ESSENCE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED 
TO BOTTLE 
ABSOLUTELY L. AGREE L. 
THINK THE FACT IT WAS MADE BY MATES 
THE FACT THAT WE MADE THIS FILM 
OUTSIDE OF A SYSTEM MUCH THERE WAS 
NO BUDGET WE WERE NEVER THINKING 
THERE WAS NEVER ANY SECRET HOPES 
ABOUT THIS TURNING INTO SOMETHING 
OTHER THAN WHAT IT WAS L. THINK IN 
A WAY WE WERE LUCKY IN WHATEVER 
SINCERITY IT IS WHEN YOU MAKE ART 
OR WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR WHEN YOU 
JUST DO YOUR THING WHEN YOU MAKE 
YOUR WORK THAT SOMEHOW IT 
TRANSLATED WE ARE VERY LUCKY TALK TALK TO US ABOUT THE SONG ARE THE 
LYRICS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR LIFE 
STORY AS WELL 
I GUESS EVERYTHING 
YOU WRITE IS DEFINITELY EVEN 
THOUGH IT WAS WRITTEN THE SONG IS 
WRITTEN FOR THE FILM THERE IS THAT 
DEFINITELY THING THAT YOU DRAW ON 
THE SAME SOURCE WHICH IS YOUR OWN 
BLUES IF YOU LIKE SO I GUESS AT 
THE BASIS OF ANY GOOD SONG IT IS 
SELF MEDICATION THAT'S REALLY HOW 
YOU ARE FIXING YOURSELF UP BY 
SINGING WHAT YOU NEED TO GET IT OFF 
YOUR CHEST L. THINK IT IS 
DEFINITELY DRAWING ON THE SAME 
PLACE I WOULD HAVE DRAWN FROM WHEN 
WRITING ANY OTHER SONG 
THE SANG 
THE SONG FALLING SHRELY AT THE 
OSCARS TSM MUST HAVE BEEN WILD FALLING SLOWLY D. MUST HAVE BEEN 
WILD THERE WAS AN AMAZING OR 
KESTRA WE PLAYED IT TWICE WITH 
THEM AND THEY GOT IT OR THE KES 
T. R. A. T. R. A. OR KEST RA 
IN THE ACCEPTANCE SPEECH THEY CUT 
MARKETA OFF 
THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY HAD THE 
OSCARS RIGHT L. FELT IT WAS UNLUCKY 
TO WRITE SOMETHING BUT MAR SAID IN 
THE UNLIKELY CHANCE WE ARE UP THERE 
YOU SAY YOUR THING AND I WILL SAY 
THANK YOU L. GOT UP ON THE STAGE 
AND I WANTED TO THANK JOHN CARNEY 
HE WAS THE ONLY THING MY BRAIN 
WENT TO MUSH L. DON'T KNOW WHAT I 
SAID MAR WENT TOVER SAY THANK YOU 
AND THE MUSIC CAME UP AND THEN THE 
PRESENTER OF THE SHOW WAS BRILLIANT 
HE WENT BACK STAGE AGE I WAS 
HUGGING JANITORS AND HE SAID HE 
WANTED MAR TO COME BACK OUT SHE 
THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING BACK OUT TO

WILL HAVE BEEN NOMINATED BY FRIENDS 
OR FAMILY BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW 
HOW TO DECORATE WE ARE ABOUT A 
RESPONSE TO THE BEIGE BRITAIN WE 
GO IN AND WE ADD COLOUR AND 
COMPLETELY CHANGE LIVES IT IS A 
SAD INDICTMENT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING 
IN THE DECORATING WORLD TODAY BUT A 
SURVEY CARRIED OUT BY A LEADING 
BRITISH PAINT MANUFACTURER SHOWED 
THAT FORTY PER CENT OF BRITAIN BRITAIN FOLLOW 
ADVICE OF THE HOUSE DOCTOR OR 
PROPERTY LADDER WHERE THERE IS A 
MANTRA OF PAINTING EVERYTHING BEIGE 
BUT WE ARE RESPONDING TO THAT OF 
THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE SURVEYED 
NINETY ONE PER CENT SAID THEY WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE 
WAY THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN HOW TO 
DECORATE FROM NOW ON COLIN AND 
JUSTIN ARE BACK WITH COLOUR YOU YOU WOULD GO FOR THE LIME GREEN OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IF IT WAS 
APPROPRIATE FOR JUSTIN THAT CLIP

WOMAN FOUR KIDS FOUR DOGS FOUR 
CATS SHE ACTUALLY THOUGHT WE WERE

WAS BIGGER THAN THAT IF YOU HAVE A 
PROBLEM AT HOME A PROBLEM WITH 
DEKOR YOU HAVE A PROBLEM AT HOME 
IN YOUR MIND AS WELL SHE WAS 
REALLY UNHAPPY THE FAMILY WERE 
UNHAPPY WE TRANSFORMED THAT INTO A 
VERY INDIVIDUAL SPACE WE DID NOT 
PAINT IT ALL BEIGE IT IS NOT BLAND 
THERE ARE EXPLOSIONS OF COLONIAL 
STYLE IN ONE OF THE ROOMS 
DO YOU 
DO A LIFE LAUNDRY JOB TAKE 
EVERYTHING OUT AND START AGAIN NO NO THE THING WE DO IS WE ALWAYS LISTEN 
MUCH THE KEY THING IS LISTENING TO 
THE SUBJECTS BECAUSE IF WE GO IN 
THERE AND ROLLER COASTER WE CREATE 
HOMES THAT IS ARE INAPPROPRIATE WE 
SIT DOWN WITH THEM AND LISTEN TO 
WHAT THEY WANT TO KEEP AND DITCH 
WHAT THEY WANT TO LOSE WE EDIT WE 
TAKE AN UNRULY HOME TIDY AND 
REDECORATE WE MAKE PEOPLE BETTER 
PEOPLE BY DESIGN 
WE ARE ALL 
OBSESSED WITH PROPERTY PRICES YOU 
REPORTED IN THE NEWS THE PRICES ARE 
SLUMPING AGAIN ACTUALLY THE 
BIGGEST RETURN YOU SHOULD GET FROM 
YOUR HOME IS ON A DAILY BASIS WE 
STILL DON'T HAVE THAT THINKING IN 
BRITAIN WHEN YOU GET BACK TO YOUR 
PERSONAL SPACE YOUR BIGGEST 
INVESTMENT IT SHOULD BE BEAUTIFUL 
PRACTICAL FUNCTIONAL 
LET'S SEE 
HOW BEAUTIFUL AND PRACTICAL YOUR 
WORK IS 
BIG CHANGES IN THIS SPACE 
THIS IS MERELY THE START OF WHAT IS 
GOING TO BE THE BEST TELEVISION 
REVEAL EVER EVERYBODY EVERYBODY IS 
CRYING MEET YOUR NEW BEDROOM 
OH MY GOD 
THIS IS INCREDIBLE 
THIS IS YOUR NEW BEDROOM 
THAT IS A CHANGE THAT WAS A BLACK 
AND WHITE LOOK BUT TWO TEENAGE 
GIRLS THAT IS JUST PART OF THAT 
HOUSE THOSE GIRLS WERE RELIEVED 
THEY WERE THE DIFFICULT TEENAGERS 
DIDN'T WANT TO SPEAK BUT THEY WERE 
DESPERATE TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL SPACE 
DOES IT COST A LOT OF MONEY 
ON THIS 
SHOW WE HAVE A BIG BUDGET WE ARE 
SPENDING SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF 
FIFTY THOUSAND TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WHEN WE 
STARTED FILM THIS A YEAR AGO 
BRITAIN WASN'T READY FOR COLOUR WE 
WERE STILL DECORATING EVERYTHING 
BEIGE THAT IS WHY WE FLEW ACROSS 
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC 
CANADIANS ARE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY 
TO FIND HOW PEOPLE WOULD RESPOND TO 
COLOUR IN THEIR HOMES IT'S WORKED 
REALLY WELL NOW WE ARE ABOUT TO 
TAKE OUR WAUNEDS OUT IN BRITAIN AND 
DAZZLE THE NATION 
THAT IS A LOT OF 
MONEY THAT IS NOT WHAT YOUR 
AVERAGE PERSON HAS TO SPEND BUT BUT IT'S NOT HOW MUCH YOU SPEND IT'S 
HOW YOU SPEND IT THAT MATTERS WE 
HAVE BEEN IN PROJECT WHERE WE HAVE 
SPENT NO MONEY AT ALL IT'S ABOUT 
BEING SELECTIVE NOBODY SITS DOWN 
AND THINKS ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF 
THEIR HOME THEY DON'T ASK 
THEMSELVES WHO DO I WANT TO BE AT 
HOME THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE PERIOD 
OF CONSTRUCTION IF YOU DO THAT AND 
WEED OUT THE RUBBISH WE TALK ABOUT 
DECLUTTERING WHICH SOUNDS LIKE 
PUTTING YOUR LIFE IN BIN WE 
CELEBRATE FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS A A HOUSE IS A PLACE TO LIVE IN AND IT 
IS A PROCESS OF EVOLUTION 
IT IS 
THAT'S WHY I WAS VERY KEEN TO SAY 
EARLIER WE REALLY LISTEN TO OUR 
HOME OWNERS IT IS NOT ABOUT ROLLER 
COSTING PEOPLE INTO WHAT WE THINK 
IS RIGHT L. WILL ADMIT IN THE PAST 
WE HAVE CALLED THE SHOTS BUT FROM 
NOW ON WE ARE USING THE LUGS 
BECAUSE PEOPLE'S HOMES ARE THE 
PLACES TO WHICH THEY ESCAPE THE 
HUSTLE OF OUR FAST WORLD WE REALLY 
WANT TO MAKE THOSE SANCTURIES INNER 
NESTS FOR PEOPLE IF WE CAN ADD A 
BIT OF FUN AND DRAMA AND MORE 
IMPORTANTLY IF WE CAN ADD A BIT OF 
COLOUR AND BANISH DECORATING BEIGE 
I KNOW IN THE FIRST CLIP WE PLAYED 
YOU WERE ACTUALLY ILL WHEN YOU 
ARRIVED 
YOU DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO ARRIVED COME ROUND TO YOUR HOUSE AND THROW 
UP 
I DO BECAUSE WE WALK IN AND UP THE HOUSE IS SO MESSY WE DO FIVE 
OR SIX ROOMS IN THIS PARTICULAR 
PROPERTY THAT IS ON THIS EVENING 
AND THE HOUSE IS SO BAD IT'S 
COVERED IN FECKAL DEBRIS FROM DOGS 
AND CATS IT IS JUST APPALLING L. 
HAVE NEVER BEEN ILL ON CAMERA BUT I 
LOSE MY LUNCH L. SAID THAT'S IMPORTANT 
IF SOMEBODY TURNED UP AT IMPORTANT MY HOUSE WHO I HAD NEVER MET BEFORE 
WEARING A LIME GREEN TIE THAT WAS 
TWELVE INCHES SHORTER THAN IT SHOULD BE 
I WOULDN'T BE NECESSARILY INCLINED 
TO TAKE YOUR ADVICE 
RIGHT BACK AT 
YOU HONEY 
WE ARE SO BORING IN 
BRITAIN PEOPLE'S HOMES ARE SO 
BORING INVESTING IS OVER NESTING 
IS IN ACTUALLY DOING YOUR OWN 
THING BEING WHO YOU WANT TO BE 
YOUR HOME IS WHERE YOU CLOSE THE 
DOOR AND IF YOU ARE INTO BLACK AND 
WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY IF YOU ARE INTO 
ANYTHING YOU CAN DESIGN YOUR HOME 
TO BE REALLY FIRED UP BY YOUR 
PASSIONS 
WHAT I MEANT BY THAT RUDE PASSIONS QUESTION WAS THAT HOW DID YOU GAIN 
THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU 
WERE WORKING WITH 
AGAIN IT IS 
BACK TO LISTENING WE ARE COLOURFUL 
I GUESS WHETHER WE ARE COLOURFUL 
IN OUR HOMES IN THE WAY WE 
BROADCAST WE DON'T LIKE TO WHISPER 
WE GARNER TRUST IT IS ALL ABOUT 
LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE WANT AND 
MAKING A PROJECT APPROPRIATE IN 
CANADA THIS SHOW HAS DONE WELL AND 
I HOPE IT WILL DO AS WELL IN 
BRITAIN THE RESPONSE WE HAVE HAD 
FROM EVERYBODY IS THAT WE ARE 
REALLY TRUSTED BECAUSE WE ARE 
FRIENDLY WE ARE APPROACHABLE AND 
WHAT WE DO WE DO WITH A REALLY 
GOOD MIND WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE 
OVERBEARING STATEMENTS WHEN WE 
DON'T NEED TO ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT 
THINK OTHERWISE WITH THE TIE WE 
ARE IN PEOPLE'S HOMES THEY HAVE 
ASKED US TO GO THERE WE HAVE A 
TELEVISION BUDGET TO MAKE THE HOMES
