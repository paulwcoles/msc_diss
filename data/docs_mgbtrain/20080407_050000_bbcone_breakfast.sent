ARRIVED AT GREENWICH WHERE DAME 
KELLY HOLMES LIT THE OLYMPIC 
CAULDRON ROUNDING OFF A RELAY THAT

THE TEN P. RATE OF TAX ACCORDING TO A 
COMMITTEE OF M. P.'S IN A REPORT OUT 
THIS MORNING AND THERE IS EVIDENCE 
OF GROWING DISCONTENT AMONG LABOUR 
BACKBENCHERS AMONG IT LET'S TALK 
TO OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT 
CAROLE WALKER WHY IS THIS COMING 
TO A HEAD NOW SEEING AS HOW THE 
DECISION WAS MADE SOMETIME AGO 
ESSENTIALLY IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE 
ARE FINALLY BEGINNING TO FEEL IT

CHANCELLOR JUST OVER A YEAR AGO 
IN HIS LAST BUDGET IT IS AT A TIME 
WHEN FAMILIES ARE FEELING THE PINCH 
FROM RISING PRICES A LOT OF M. P.'S

RAISING IT WITH THEM WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED IS THAT ALTHOUGH BASIC 
RATE OF INCOME TAX HAS BEEN CUT

ALREADY GONE THROUGH BUT M. P.'S ARE 
TRYING TO FIND A WAY OF PUTTING 
DOWN AMENDMENTS TO A FINANCE BILL 
THAT WILL BE GOING THROUGH THE 
COMMONS IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS' TIME 
TO FORCE A VOTE ON IT L. THINK 
LABOUR COULD FACE AT THE MOMENT 
QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL REBELLION ON

ALREADY INDICATING THEY MIGHT TRY 
TO EXPLOIT THAT UNEASE ON LABOUR

HOSPITALS SHOULD LEARN TO SAY 
SORRY MORE OFTEN ACCORDING TO 
ENGLAND'S HEALTH WATCHDOG SHALL THE 
HEALTHCARE COMMISSION IT SAYS 
WHILE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE 
BY N. H. S. TRUSTS IN THE WAY THEY 
HANDLE COMPLAINTS AND THEIR 
MISTAKES PROGRESS CAN BE MADE IN 
PATIENT CARE BY OFFERING A SIMPLE 
APOLOGY APOLOGY RELATIVES OF THE VICTIMS OF THE 
OMAGH BOMBING BEGIN A CIVIL CASE 
TODAY AGAINST FIVE MEN THEY CLAIM 
WERE BEHIND THE ATTACK THEY ARE 
CLAIMING MILLIONS IN COMPENSATION 
AT THE HIGH COURT IN BELFAST 
TWENTY NINE PEOPLE AND UNBORN TWINS DIED AS 
A RESULT OF THE OMAGH BOMBING THE 
ATTACK WAS THE SUBJECT OF A HUGE 
POLICE INVESTIGATION BUT SO FAR NO

MINDS WE HAVE BEEN INSIDE SO MANY

IS IMPORTANT FOR THE FAMILIES AT 
LEAST TO GET A VERDICT AND WE 
BELIEVE THAT OUR CASE IS STRONG AND 
WE WILL HOLD PEOPLE TO ACCOUNT 
WHICH HASN'T HAPPENED SO FAR IN 
OMAGH 
THE ONLY PERSON CHARGED WITH OMAGH MURDER WAS CLEARED OF ANY 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOMBING LAST 
YEAR CONCERNS ABOUT THE EVIDENCE 
IN THAT TRIAL MEANS ANOTHER 
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IS UNLIKELY 
MAKING THIS CIVIL CASE A LAST 
CHANCE FOR JUSTICE FOR THE FAMILIES 
SCIENTISTS IN AMERICA SAY THEY MAY 
HAVE FOUND A NEW WAY TO TREAT 
SUPERBUGS SUCH AS MRSA USING

THERE IS A LACK OF SUPPORT FOR 
PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM PARKINSON'S 
DISEASE ACCORDING TO THE LARGEST 
EVER SURVEY INTO THE DISEASE WHICH 
FOUND ONE QUARTER OF SUFFERERS ARE 
MISSING OUT ON SPECIAL CARE STEVE 
FORD OF THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE 
SOCIETY JOINS US WHAT IS THE 
PROBLEM PROBLEM THE IS WAS THE BIGGEST SURVEY EVER 
DONE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THIS 
WAS WHAT THEY TOLD US IS THEY ARE 
MISSING OUT ON SPECIALIST CARE IN 
MANY SITUATIONS PEOPLE ARE BEING 
DIAGNOSED BY G. P.'S IT SHOULD BE 
DIAGNOSED BY SPECIALISTS PEOPLE 
ARE NOT GETTING THE SUPPORT FROM 
SPECIALIST NURSES WITHOUT THAT 
SUPPORT PEOPLE WILL NOT GET THE 
BEST POSSIBLE CARE AND SYMPTOMS 
WILL NOT BE MANAGED 
HIS EARLIER DIAGNOSIS IMPORTANT 
IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE 
TREATMENT CAN BE STARTED PEOPLE 
UNDERSTAND THE CONDITION TREATMENT 
IN THE EARLY STAGES CAN MAKE A 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE 
LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS AN OLDER 
PERSON'S DISEASE IS THAT THE CASE 
THE AVERAGE AGE AT DIAGNOSIS WOULD 
BE IN THE EARLY SIXTIES ONE IN TWENTY 
PEOPLE ARE DIAGNOSED BEFORE THEY'RE 
FORTY FOR THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE 
GETTING DIAGNOSIS GETTING 
TREATMENT BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE 
AT WORK THEY'RE ALL VITALLY 
IMPORTANT IT IS ABOUT GOOD 
TREATMENT AND COULD INFORMATION 
COULD INFORMATION HALF THE PEOPLE 
WITH PARKINSON'S ARE NOT GETTING 
THE INFORMATION THEY NEED THEY ARE 
NOT BEEN SIGNPOSTED TO 
ORGANISATIONS LIKE OURS 
I AM ALSO INTERESTED TO HEAR SAY 
THAT EVEN IF YOU HAVE PARKINSON'S 
IT CAN BE MANAGED AND YOU CAN GO 
BACK TO WORK AND CONTINUE A NORMAL 
LIFE LIFE SURE THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT 
PARKINSON'S IS THE IT IS VERY 
INDIVIDUAL THE PROGRESSING CAN BE 
VERY INDIVIDUAL THERE PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE WHO WERE ABLE TO WORK FOR 
LONG TIME THE PROBLEM MIGHT 
TREATMENT IS YOU'RE CONSTANTLY 
LOOKING AT THE SIDE EFFECTS IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO GET THAT RIGHT BALANCE 
IT IS IMPORTANT PEOPLE SEE NURSES 
AND DOCTORS ON A REGULAR BASIS 
IT IS AND NEW YEAR OF SORTS BUT 
NOBODY IS REALLY CELEBRATING 
BECKTON CAN EXPLAIN ALL DE CLER 
I PROMISED I WOULD EXPLAIN THESE 
TAX CHANGES THE BASIC RATE OF 
INCOME TAX HAS BEEN CUT FROM TWENTY TWO P. TO 
TWENTY THAT BENEFIT MOST TAXPAYERS 
BUT THE TEN PER CENT TAX RATE HAS BEEN 
ABOLISHED THAT PENALISES THE LOW 
PAID AND PART TIME TO GUESTS WILL 
EXPLAIN THIS A TAX EXPERT OF PRICE 
WATERHOUSE COOPER AND JASMINE 
BIRTLES OUR FINANCIAL COMMENTATOR 
WE HAVE THREE TYPICAL CASES OF 
PEOPLE AFFECTED THIS IS WATER HE 
IS FIFTY FOUR YEARS OLD HE WORKS IN A BAG 
WATER HE WORKS IN A BANK WHY 
IS HE BETTER OFF 
HE DOES BETTER BECAUSE THE GAINS 
LOT ON THE TWO PER CENT COT ON THE ROUNDABOUT 
HE LOSES A BIT ON THE TWO PER CENT SWING HE 
PAYS LITTLE MORE ON NATIONAL 
INSURANCE IF HE HAD A CAR THAT 
WOULD COST HIM MORE BUT HE AS 
ENDED UP QUITE WELL OFF 
ONE THING TO LOOK AT IS HOW MUCH 
THEY ARE PAYING INTO THEIR PENSION 
FUND QUEUE MARKED ABSOLUTELY 
IT IS EASIER FOR WATER BECAUSE HE 
IS PROBABLY PAYING FORTY PER CENT TAX THE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY THE GOVERNMENT IS 
PUTTING IN WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING 
MONEY INTO YOUR PENSION IS GOING 
DOWN THAT IS NOT HELPFUL BECAUSE 
OUR PENSIONS ARE NOT BIG ENOUGH 
LET US MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND 
EXAMPLE THIS IS AN HOUR SHE IS FIFTY SEVEN 
ANNA SHE HAS TAKEN EARLIER 
RETIREMENT SHE IS WORSE OFF WHY 
SHE IS IN THE CLASSIC TRAP SHE 
LOSES TOO MUCH ON THIS TEN PER CENT GOING 
UP TO TWENTY PER CENT BECAUSE SHE NO LONGER 
BENEFIT FROM THIS TEN PER CENT BAND SHE IS 
NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT FROM THE 
MUCH HIGHER ALLOWANCES GOING TO THE 
SIXTY FIVE PLUS 
HERE IS SOMEONE NOT ON VERY MUCH 
MONEY AT ALL WHO IS WORSE OFF WERE 
AS WATER ENDS UP BETTER PAID OFF 
YES AND THE PROBLEM WITH AN ARRAY 
SHE MAY NOT REALISE WHAT KIND OF 
BENEFITS SHE CAN APPLY FOR HE HAS 
NOT HAD TO DO ANYTHING 
THERE IS ANOTHER CASE WHICH WE WILL 
LOOK AT IN AN HOUR THAT IS THE 
CASE OF A YOUNG WORKER WITH NOT 
VERY MUCH IN TERMS OF SALARY AND 
WE WILL SEE IS ALSO A LOT WORSE OFF 
ONE OF THE BIG DIFFICULTIES FACING 
SINGLE MOTHERS CAN BE THE FEELING 
OF ISOLATION LOOKING AFTER CHILDREN 
AROUND THE CLOCK WHAT HAPPENED 
WHEN TEN MUMS AND THEIR YOUNG ONES 
GET TO LIVE TOGETHER IN ONE BIG 
MANSION WERE THERE TEARS BEFORE

CHILDREN'S T. V. PRESENTER KONNIE HUQ 
TWO THOUSAND OFFICERS WERE DEPLOYED AND 
THEY WERE SWIFT TO ACT BUT SOME 
DEMONSTRATORS ACCUSED THEM OF BEING 
HEAVY HANDED 
SO A ROUGH DAY FOR THE POLICE AND 
THIS MORNING'S PAPERS MAKE 
UNCOMFORTABLE READING TOO WITH 
THE TIMES SAYING THEY WERE HUMAN 
IMAITED WHILE OTHERS USE WORDS 
LIKE MAYHEM AND FARCE TO 
DESCRIBE PROCEEDINGS BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAVE PRAISED THE POLICE 
HANDLING OF THE EVENT AND THE MET 
THEMSELVES SAY THERE IS A FINE LINE 
TO BE TREAD BETWEEN ALLOWING 
PEACEFUL PROTEST AND THE DISRUPTION 
OF A SHOWCASE EVENT 
GORDON BROWN 
DO SOMETHING ABOUT TIBET PLEASE 
GORDON BROWN I URGE YOU DESPITE DESPITE THE PROBLEMS THE TORCH FINALLY 
ARRIVED AT GREENWICH WHERE DAME 
KELLY HOLMES LIT THE OLYMPIC 
CAULDRON ROUNDING OFF A RELAY THAT 
WAS BILLED AS A JOURNEY OF HARMONY 
BUT ENDED IN DISCORD 
AFTER EIGHT HUNDRED A M. WE WILL TALK TO KONNIE 
HUQ WHO WAS PART OF THE RELAY AND 
NEARLY HAD THE FLAME GRABBED FROM 
HER HAND AND ONE OF THE SEEN AREA 
POLICE OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF THE 
OPERATION OPERATION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WILL BE THE 
BIGGEST LOSERS FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO 
ABILLIONISH THE TEN P. RATE OF TAX 
ACCORDING TO A COMMITTEE OF M. P.'S 
ABOLISH THE TEN P. RATE OF TAX THERE 
IS ALSO EVIDENCE OF GROWING 
DISCONTENT AMONG LABOUR 
BACKBENCHERS OVER THE MOVE OUR 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CAROL 
WALKER IS HERE WHY THIS PRESSURE 
WHY NOW 
WELL ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE 
THIS TAX CHANGE HAS JUST TAKEN 
EFFECT IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY GORDON 
BROWN IN HIS LAST BUDGET AS 
CHANCELLOR BUT IT IS JUST HITTING 
PEOPLE IN THEIR WALLETS AND AN 
AWFUL LOT OF LABOUR M. P.'S ARE HEARING 
ABOUT IT FROM THEIR CONSTITUENTS 
WHAT YOU HAVE IS A SPECIFIC GROUP 
TYPICALLY HOUSEHOLDS WHERE YOU HAVE 
A WORKING FAMILY BUT NO CHILDREN 
EARNING LESS THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WHO ARE 
LOSING OUT THE TREASURY SELECT 
COMMITTEE TODAY SAYS IT IS 
UNREASONABLE TO TARGET THESE PEOPLE 
AND OF COURSE THEY ARE LABOUR'S 
CORE VOTERS A LOT OF LABOUR M. P.'S 
ARE CONCERNED 
IS THERE ANY CHANCE 
OF A RE THINK OVER THIS 
WELL THE 
BUSINESS SECRETARYINGS JOHN HUTTON 
WAS ON THE TELEVISION YESTERDAY 
SAYING THAT THERE WAS NO WAY OF 
UNRAVELING THIS NOW IT HAD GOT INTO 
TRAIN BUT CERTAINLY LABOUR M. P.'S WILL 
TRY AND FORCE A VOTE WHEN A FINANCE 
BILL GOES THROUGH THE COMMONS IN A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS' TIME AS THINGS 
STAND THE GOVERNMENT COULD BE 
FACING QUITE A BIG REBELLION THERE 
IS A REAL HEAD OF STEAM BUILDING UP 
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL IT 
IS SIMPLY UNFAIR NOW IT WOULD BE 
VERY HUMILIATING FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
TO DO A U. TURN ON THIS NOW THERE 
HAVE BEEN ONE OR TWO HINTS THEY 
MIGHT TRY AND HELP THEM OUT WITH 
TAX CREDITS OR SOMETHING BUT THE 
PROBLEM IS A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE 
DON'T CLAIM THE TAX CREDITS SO 
THAT MAY NOT BE THE SOLUTION 
INTERESTING IN A FEW MOMENTS' TIME 
WE WILL SPEAK TO DECLAN GOING 
THROUGH THE NUMBERS TELLING US WHO 
WILL BE AFFECTED AND WHETHER YOU 
WILL BE AFFECTED PORTUGESE

SUSPECTS WILL NOT BE REINTERVIEWED 
THEY INSIST THEIR DAUGHTER WAS 
ABDUCTED AND THEIR SPOKESMAN HAS 
WELCOMED THESE INTERVIEWS AS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR THEM OF ANY 
SUSPICION SUSPICION TWO MEN HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN

LATERMENT LATERMENT PLANS TO REMOVE PERSISTENT TROUBLE 
MAKESERS FROM THE CLASSROOM AND 
GIVE TEACHERS BETTER PROTECTION 
WILL BE OUTLINED BY CONSERVATIVE 
LEADER DAVID CAMERON TODAY HE 
WANTS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR HEAD 
TEACHERS TO EXCLUDE PUPILS AND 
RESTRICT THE RIGHT TO APPEAL 
AGAINST THE DECISION THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS DISMISSED THE 
PROPOSALS AS GIMMICKS HOSPITALS 
SHOULD LEARN TO SAY SORRY MORE 
OFTEN ACCORDING TO ENGLAND'S HEALTH 
WATCHDOG THE HEALTHCARE COMMISSION 
IT SAYS WHILE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE 
BEEN MADE BY N. H. S. TRUSTS IN THE WAY 
THEY HANDLE COMPLAINTS AND THEIR 
MISTAKES PROGRESS CAN BE MADE IN 
PATIENT CARE BY OFFERING A SIMPLE 
APOLOGY APOLOGY RELATIVES OF VICTIMS OF THE OMAGH 
BOMBING BEGIN A CIVIL CASE TODAY 
AGAINST FIVE MEN WHO THEY CLAIM 
WERE BEHIND THE ATTACK THEY ARE 
CLAIMING MILLIONS OF POUNDS IN 
COMPENSATION CHRIS BUCKLER IS 
OUTSIDE THE HIGH COURT IN BELFAST 
COVERING THE STORY FOR US THIS 
MORNING MORNING CHRIS GOOD 
MORNING TO YOU IT IS ONLY FEW 
MONTHS OF COURSE SINCE THE FAMILIES 
WERE LAST AT COURT HERE IN BELFAST 
THAT WAS FOR CRIMINAL CASE AND 
THEY SAW THE ONLY MAN CHARGED WITH 
THE MURDERS OF THEIR RELATIVES 
CLEARED OF ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
BOMBING TODAY'S CIVIL CASE IS 
RATHER DIFFERENT AND IT IS AGAINST 
FIVE DIFFERENT MEN IN COURT TODAY 
THEY WILL FIGHT THE ALLEGATIONS 
THAT THEY WERE THE LEADERSHIP OF 
THE REAL I. R. A. AT THE TIME OF THE 
ATTACK IN AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE FAMILIES 
ARE HERE AS YOU SAY TO TRY TO 
CLAIM TEN MILLION AGAINST THE MEN 
BUT THEY INSIST IT IS NOT ABOUT THE 
MONEY IT IS ABOUT PRINCIPLE IT IS 
ABOUT TRYING TO HOLD SOMEONE TO 
ACCOUNT FOR DAY THEY WILL NEVER 
BE ABLE TO FORGET TWENTY NINE PEOPLE AND 
UNBORN TWINS DIED AS A RESULT OF 
THE OMAGH BOMBING THE ATTACK WAS 
THE SUBJECT OF A HUGE POLICE 
INVESTIGATION BUT SO FAR NO ONE 
HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF THE MURDERS 
THIS IS WRIT FOR YOUR SON SEAMUS 
SIX YEARS AGO SOLICITORS ACTING FOR 
THE FAMILIES' VICTIMS SERVED WRITS 
AGAINST FIVE MEN THEY BELIEVE WERE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXPLOSION COLM 
MURPHY WHO IS WARRANTLY AWAITING A 
RETRIAL ON THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND 
ON CONSPIRACY CHARGES LINKED TO THE 
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ATTACK LIAM CAMPBELL SEAMUS 
DALY SEAMUS MCKENNA AND MICHAEL 
MCKEVITT WHO IS IN JAIL IN THE 
REPUBLIC FOR DIRECTING TERRORISM 
AT THE HIGH COURT THE FAMILIES ARE 
CLAIMING COMPENSATION OF MORE THAN 
TEN MILLION 
I THINK THAT REALLY 
MONEY IS THE LAST THING ON OUR 
MINDS I THINK THAT AS I SAID WE 
HAVE SEEN AND BEEN INSIDE SO MANY 
COURTS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AND 
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE FAMILIES 
AT LEAST TO GET A VERDICT AND WE 
BELIEVE THAT OUR CASE IS STRONG AND 
WE WILL HOLD PEOPLE TO ACCOUNT 
WHICH HASN'T HAPPENED SO FAR IN 
OMAGH 
THE ONLY PERSON CHARGED WITH OMAGH MURDER WAS CLEARED OF ANY 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOMBING LAST 
YEAR CONCERNS ABOUT THE EVIDENCE 
IN THAT TRIAL MEANS ANOTHER 
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IS UNLIKELY 
MAKING THIS CIVIL CASE A LAST 
CHANCE FOR JUSTICE FOR THE FAMILIES 
NOT ALL THE RELATIVES ARE PART OF 
THIS CIVIL ACTION SOME HAVE 
DROPPED OUT ALONG THE WAY 
FRUSTRATED BY THE LEDGE OF TIME IT 
HAS TAKEN THIS CIVIL ACTION TO GET 
TO COURT BY THE LENGTH OF TIME 
AND ALSO THE PROBLEMS WITH THE 
EVIDENCE THERE IS AN ONGOING ROW 
WITH THE IRISH POLICE ABOUT THEIR 
ABILITY TO GET EVIDENCE TO THE 
FAMILIES BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT 
FUTURE PROSECUTIONS 
NONETHELESS THIS CIVIL ACTION WILL 
BEGIN TODAY SCIENTISTS IN AMERICA 
SAY THEY MAY HAVE FOUND A NEW WAY 
TO TREAT SUPERBUGS SUCH AS MRSA 
USING ALLIGATOR BLOOD RESEARCHERS 
SAY ANTIBODIES IN THE BLOOD HELP 
ALLIGATORS RECOVER VERY QUICKLY IF 
THEY ARE INJURED IN TERRITORIAL 
BATTLES DESPITE COMING INTO 
CONTACT WITH BACTERIA IN DIRTY 
WATER WATER THERE YOU GO 
IT IS AN INTERESTING USE FOR 
ALLIGATORS ALLIGATORS SHE'S FAMOUS FOR BEING QUEEN OF THE 
KITCHEN BUT DELIA SMITH'S COME 
UNDER CONSIDERABLE FIRE OVER HER 
NEW BEST SELLER HOW TO CHEAT AT 
COOKING CASH A CHARITY THAT 
CAMPAIGNS FOR A REDUCTION OF SALT 
IN OUR FOOD HAS CALCULATED THAT 
SOME OF DELIA'S DISHES HAVE HIGH 
LEVELS OF SALT SOME DISHES CONTAIN 
THE TOTAL RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM FOR 
AN ENTIRE DAY WITH US PROFESSOR 
GRAHAM MCGREGOR WHO IS CHAIRMAN OF 
CASH CONIS ENUS ACTION ON SALT YOU 
ARE ALSO A PROFESSOR OF 
CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE SO YOU ARE 
CONCERNED WITH SALT LEVELS IN FOOD 
WHAT HAS DELIA GOT WRONG THE THE PROBLEM IS SHE IS TAKING PROCESSED 
IN SOME RECIPES NOT ALL TAKING 
PROCESSED FOODS WHICH ALREADY HAVE 
SALT AND THEN ADDING MORE SALTY 
INGREDIENTS SUCH AS OLIVES CAPERS 
PECCORINO ROMANO CHEESE ONE OF 
THE MOST SALTIEST AND IN ONE 
RECIPE SHE IS USING A POWDER WHICH 
TWO AND A HALF TEASPOONFULS IS 
EQUIVALENT OF SIX GRAMS OF SALT IN 
ONE OF THE RECIPES SHE RECOMMENDS 
PUTTING THAT IN SOME OF RECIPES 
COME OUT HIGH IN SALT IT IS 
UNFORTUNATE 
WHY IS TOO MUCH SALT UNFORTUNATE BAD FOR YOU 
IN THE AMOUNT WE EAT 
WHICH IS AROUND TEN TO TWELVE G. R. M. S. A DAY 
IT IS A CHRONIC LONG TERM TOXIN 
THAT SLOWLY PUTS UP THE BLOOD 
PRESSURE AND THAT IS'S THE BIGGEST 
CAUSE OF DEATH THROUGH THE STROKES 
AND HEART ATTACKS IT CAUSES 
THAT PUTS UP BLOOD 
CONTRARY OR THE CONTRARY ANYTHING 
THAT LOWERS IT WILL HAVE A HUGE 
AFFECT ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
DYING FROM STROKES AND HEART 
ATTACKS 
ARE YOU SAYING IF YOU ATTACKS FOLLOW THE RECIPES FROM DELIA'S 
BOOK YOU WILL RUN INTO HEALTH 
PROBLEMS 
NOT AT ALL WE ARE PROBLEMS TALKING ABOUT CHRONIC LONG TERM 
CONSUMPTION OF SALT OBVIOUSLY 
HAVING A ONE OFF MEAL WITH A WILL 
THE OF SALT WILL MAKE YOU THIRSTY 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CHRONIC SALT 
INTAKE WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO 
SHALL AND REMEMBER THE U. K. IS 
LEADING THE WORLD HERE IN REDUCING 
THE SALT LEVELS OF PROCESSED FOODS 
AND THE SUPERMARKETS AND FOOD 
MANUFACTURERS ARE CO OPERATING 
WHAT WE NEED TO GET IS PEOPLE LIKE 
DEALIA WHO HAVE A HUGE INFLUENCE 
PEOPLE LIKE JAMIE OLIVER AND GORDON 
RAMSEY NOT JUST DELIA TO BE AWARE 
OF THE HUGE AMOUNTS OF SALT THEY 
ARE ADDING AND START BEING AWARE 
AND REDUCE IT IT IS ANOTHER WAY OF 
GETTING SALT THAT WE WANT TO REDUCE 
IT 
WE TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH IT DELIA SMITH BUT SHE WAS UNVEIL WE 
HAVE HAD A RESPONSE FROM THE B. B. C. 
WHO SAY DELIA DOES A LOT OF FOOD 
RESEARCH SHE EXPLAINS TO VIEWERS 
ABOUT WHAT IT LOOK FOR IN A READY 
MADE PRODUCT IN ADDITION THE SHOW 
HAS SHOWED HER DISCUSSING THE 
INSTITUTE OF FOODRY SEARCH AND THEY 
USE E. NUMBERS AND REPORTS ON PEOPLE 
BEING MINDFUL OF THE INGREDIENTS IN 
THE RECIPES 
WHAT TRIGGER 
IMMEDIATE TO LOOK AT IT WAS THAT 
PROGRAMME AND THE EXPERT ACTUALLY 
SAID TO DELIA WE MUST BE AWARE 
SOME OF THESE RECIPES HAVE A LARGE 
AMOUNT OF SALT THAT'S WHY I ASKED 
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WORKING WITH ME 
TO LOOK AT THE SALT CONTENT OF SOME 
OF THE RECIPES WE MUST BE MINDFUL 
BUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHEN THEY 
LOOK AT THE RECIPES WOULDN'T BE 
ABLE TO WORK OUT SALT CONTENT 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO ON TO THE 
WEBSITE TRYING TO FIND THE SALT OF 
THE VARIOUS CHEESE 
YOU WILL TASTE 
THE SALT IN IT 
YES BUT THAT'S NOT 
THE WAY TO CALCULATE IT AND THE 
POWDER YOU HAVE TO GO ON TO THEIR 
WEBSITE AND SPEND TEN MINUTES 
LOOKING FOR IT I THINK WHAT WE 
NEED IS ACTUALLY THE B. B. C. SHOULD BE 
MORE RESPONSIBLE AND ACTUALLY TELL 
US LIKE THE SUPERMARKETS ARE 
WHAT IS THE SALT CONTENT IF YOU GO 
AND BUY A READY PROCESSED MALE MEAL 
AND SAINSBURY'S 
ARE YOU SUGGESTING 
EVERY CHEF IN EVERY RECIPE SHOULD 
HAVE A NET SAYING SALT SALT 
WHATEVER WHY NOT 
LET US HAVE A LOOK AT THE FRONT 
PAGES A LOT OF THEM COVERING THE 
STORY OF YESTERDAY'S OLYMPIC TORCH 
GOING THROUGH LONDON 
THE DAILY MAIL SAYS THAT CHINESE 
HOW THESE THE OLYMPIC SHOW PIECE

TAKE ANOTHER GO AT IT TODAY THE 
TAX CHANGES COME INTO EFFECT OVER 
THE WEEKEND BROADLY THEY MEAN MORE 
TAXPAYERS' HER BETTER OFF THE TWENTY TWO P.

DO NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY TAX CREDIT 
THE BROAD OUTLINE HIS MOST TAX 
PAYERS ARE BETTER OFF BUT LOW PAID

THE POCKET BY THESE TAX CHANGES 
I KNEW YOU COULD EXPLAIN IT TO ME 
THANK YOU DO YOU REMEMBER PLAYING 
CONKERS WHEN YOU'RE CHILD USED 
TO LOVE IT A WONDERFUL TOWER THAT 
MEMORY FROM NEIGHBOUR'S 
SCIENTISTS ARE WARNING THAT 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HORSE 
CHESTNUT TREES ARE IN DANGER BEING 
AFFECTED INFECTED BY DEADLY 
BACTERIA HAVE A LOOK AT THIS YOU 
CAN SEE THE BLACK MARKINGS ON HERE 
THAT IS CALLED IN LEADING DRINKER 
QUITE HARD TO SAY AT THIS TIME OF 
MOURNING AT BLEEDING CANKER 
THIS BACTERIA COULD BE AFFECTING 
HALF OF THE HORSE CHESTNUT TREES IN 
THE COUNTRY INITIALLY THIS HAS 
TAKEN THEM BY SURPRISE YOU COULD 
GET THE SYMPTOMS BY SOMETHING THAT 
WAS BENIGN BUT THERE HAVE BEEN 
CALLS COMING IN FROM ALL OVER 
BRITAIN AND PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE 
PROBLEMS THEY BEAT SOME FIELDWORK 
AND THEY THINK IT IS DOWN TO THIS 
BACTERIA I KNOW THEY DO NOT LOOK 
LIKE MUCH BUT THEY'RE KILLING HIS 
CONKER TREE A WIND HAS NOW OPENED 
UP ON THE TRUNK A SMACK IN WOUND 
HIS SEAT HE BLEEDING CANKER 
IT IS CAUSED BY THIS BACTERIUM 
WHICH HAS PENETRATED THE BARK WERE 
YOU GET THIS BLEEDING WHAT IS GOING 
ON IS A BACTERIUM IS KILLING THAT 
PARK UNDERNEATH AND WE'RE SEEING 
THE EXTERIOR SYMPTOMS 
IT IS THOUGHT THERE ARE MORE THAN 
ONE MILLION CONKER TREES IN BRITAIN 
BUT THE FORESTRY COMMISSION SURVEY 
SUGGESTS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BY 
THIS DISEASE THERE IS GREAT 
STORY BEHIND THESE TWO TREES THEY 
WERE PLANNED TO AROUND TWENTY YEARS AGO 
BY THE DOOR WAS OF FORESTER IT 
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE RANDOMNESS 
OF THIS DISEASE BY THE DAUGHTERS 
IT HAS KILLED THIS TREE THAT ONE 
HAS SURVIVED REMEMBER THIS THE 
DUTCH ELM DISEASE EPIDEMIC WHICH 
EXPLODED IN THE SIXTIES IT FLATTENED 
THE LANDSCAPE AND WE LOST THE THIRTY 
MILLION TREES IN YEARS FEAR NOT 
IS A RAKE IS ON SMALLER SCALE AT 
THE MOMENT THERE IS NO WAY OF 
TREATING THIS DISEASE BUT IT IS 
NOT ALL BAD NEWS 
THE BLEEDING IS LIMITED THE OTHER 
TREES JUST BECAUSE YOU SEE SOME 
BLEEDING DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN 
IT CAN IT IS A BARE SENTENCE 
THERE WILL STILL BE PLENTY OF THIS 
GOING ON THIS YEAR AT DEATH 
SENTENCE SENTENCE PAULIN THE QANA BLACK IS FROM THE 
TREE COUNCIL PAULINE BUCHANAN 
BLACK HOW 
THIS COMPARE TO THE 
DUTCH OWN CRISIS 
REALISTICALLY IT IS NOT QUITE ON 
THE SAME SCALE WE'RE NURTURE HAVE 
THIS IS ACTIVELY SPREADING IT IS A 
LOT SLOWER AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THE 
SAM CONCENTRATION 
SAME CONCENTRATION THERE ARE FEWER HORSE CHESTNUT 
THERE BUT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT 
TREES TREES YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING THAT THE FEAR 
OF ALL WAS WELL AS COUNCILS AND 
OVER ZEALOUS PEOPLE THINK IN THERE 
HAVE TO CHOP THE TREE DOWN ON THIS 
SPOT THIS BE YES 
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENS IF THE 
ASSESSMENT RISK ASSESSMENT THE 
KNEE JERK REACTION OFTEN FROM LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES WORRIED THAT LOCALS 
MIGHT MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST THEM IS 
TO CUT THE TREE DOWN 
WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU SEE THIS 
ON A TREE 
IT NEEDS MANAGING IT NEEDS 
WATCHING IS ON ITS OWN MAY NOT 
KILL THE TREE THERE ARE OTHER 
FACTORS THAT MIGHT HAVE AN IMPACT 
ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER COULD 
CAUSE THE TREE TO FAIL BUT IF YOU 
WATCH THE TREE IT MAY NOT STRONG 
TREES WILL RRY ON 
THE FIRST RECORDED CONKER GAME WAS 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT APPARENTLY THEY USED TO 
USE SNAIL SHELLS

NICK RAVENSCROFT JOINS US FROM 
OUTSIDE DEWSBURY POLICE STATION NO 
CONFIRMATION OFFICIALLY IT IS 
SHANNON'S MOTHER WHAT DO WE KNOW 
YOU ARE RIGHT NO OFFICIAL 
CONFIRMATION BUT THE B. B. C. 
UNDERSTANDS IT IS SHANNON'S MOTHER 
THAT WOULD CERTAINLY SEEM TO MAKE 
SENSE GIVEN THE FACT THE POLICE PUT 
OUT A NOTIFICATION OF THIS ARREST 
AT ABOUT ELEVEN THIRTY P. M. ON A SUNDAY NIGHT 
CLEARLY IT WAS AN IMPORTANT 
ANYTHING IN THIS INVESTIGATION SHE 
IS THE FOURTH PERSON WHO HAVE BEEN 
ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH 
SHANNON'S DISAPPEARANCE YOU WILL 
REMEMBER LAST WEEK HER PARTNER 
CRAIG MEEHAN HIS MUM AND HIS 
SISTER WERE BOTH ARRESTED 
QUESTIONED BY THE POLICE BEFORE 
BEING RELEASED OF COURSE SOME TIME 
AGO NOW CRAIG MEEHAN'S UNCLE 
MICHAEL DONOVAN A THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD MAN 
ALSO FROM DEWSBURY HE WAS CHARGED

CLAIMED TO BE A FAN OF THE CLUB 
ANDS WITH ONLY TOO EAGER TO DISPLAY 
HIS RACISM YOU ASK IF I'M 
FASCIST HE SAID LOOK AT THIS HE 
GAVE NAZI SALUTE HE TOLD ME TO 
STAY IN MY OWN COUNTRY THEN HE 
LEFT HE WOULDN'T LOOK AT ME OR 
SHAKE MY HAND 
THAT'S INSIDE SPORT 
ON B. B. C. ONE AT ELEVEN TWENTY FIVE P. M. AND LATER ON 
WE HAVE THE MAASAI WARRIORS COMING 
BACK THEY ARE HAVING BREAKFAST 
APPARENTLY THEY LOVE A CUP OF TEA 
WITH A B. O. U. T. ZERO ZERO SUGARS IN DON'T WORRY 
IF YOU WANT TO SPONSOR THEM WE WILL 
MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE WEBSITES THEY 
ARE HOPING TO RAISE SIXTY THOUSAND TO 
IMPROVE THE WATER FACILITIES IN 
THEIR VILLAGE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO 
WITH YOU THAT'S WHAT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE TOLD THE NEWS MEDIA 
AFTER IT EMERGED THE MAYOR OF 
LONDON HAS FIVE CHILDREN BY THREE 
DIFFERENT WOMEN HIS IS NOT THE 
ONLY PRIVATE LIFE THAT HAS BEEN 
UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT IN THE PAST FEW 
DAYS INDEED FORMULA ONE BOSS MAX 
MOSLEY HAD THE DETAILS OF HIS SEX 
LIFE SPREAD ACROSS THE FRONT PAGES 
SO DO THE PRIVATE LIVES OF PUBLIC 
FIGURES HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH 
US WITH US THE REVEREND RICHENDA 
LEIGH AND CHRIS HORRIE FORMER SUN 
JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR OF TABLOID 
NATION DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO 
WITH ANY OF US 
NO L. CAN SEE SOME 
THINGS THAT SOME PEOPLE DO IN THEIR 
PRIVATE LIFE MIGHT SAY IF IT WAS A 
PUBLIC FIGURE WE VOTED IN IF THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE INTEGRITY OR HAD 
FRAUDULENTLY BEHAVED BUT I DON'T 
THINK THEIR MORAL THEIR PERSONAL 
MORALITY IS UP FOR IT I'M NOT 
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED L. DON'T CARE 
WELL CHRIS ARE OTHER PEOPLE CARE INTERESTED IT IS REALLY THE 
QUESTION THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN 
TO FOR THE PAPE SNEERS THIS 
JOURNALISM IS NOT GOING TO WIN THE 
PULITZER PRIZE IT IS NOT THE SORT 
OF THING THE B. B. C. WOULD DO BUT IT IS 
PART OF THE PRESS SCENE OF THE THE 
PRESS REALLY HAS A DUTY TO BE A 
BLOODHOUND AS WELL AS A WATCHDOG 
AND THIS IS ATTACK JOURNALISM IT 
IS INVESTIGATIVE FORM OF JOURNALISM 
THE SAME TECHNIQUES THAT WOULD BE 
USED TO EXPOSE CRIME AND WRONG 
DOING IT IT IS NOT ILLEGAL OR 
HURTING ANYONE IS IT OTHER 
PEOPLE'S BUSINESS 
PEOPLE ARE 
INTERESTED BOTH OF THESE 
CHARACTERS THEY ARE DIFFERENT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE ON THE ONE HAND AND MAX 
MOSLEY BUT THEY ARE IMPORTANT 
FIGURES IN PUBLIC LIFE FORMULA ONE 
RACING IS IMPORTANT IT IS A BIG 
BUSINESS HOW IT IS CONDUCTED THE 
PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH IT COULD BE A 
LEGITIMATE FORM OF PUBLIC INTEREST 
BUT I'M SURE THAT'S NOT WHY THEY 
ARE DOING IT THEY ARE DOING 
IS A CRACKING THE SUN 
BECAUSE IT IS A CRACKING THE SUN OF THE FORMER FASCIST LEADER OF 
BRITAIN INVOLVED IN THESE RATHER 
PECULIAR GOINGS ON IT IS A WATER 
COOLER MOMENT FOR A FEW SECONDS 
PEOPLE SAY DID YOU SEE THAT BUT 
THEY WILL JUSTIFY IT AS BEING IN 
THE PUBLIC INTEREST 
THAT'S THE 
PROBLEM ISN'T IT IT IS THAT WATER 
COOLER MOMENT PERHAPS PEOPLE 
TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW IT IS 
GOSSIP 
I THINK IT IS A REAL WASTE GOSSIP OF OUR TIME AND A REAL WASTE OF 
PROPER JOURNALISTIC TIME L. THINK 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF STORIES THAT 
REALLY NEED RESEARCHING THAT 
REALLY NEED SOME GOOD BLOODHOUNDING 
AND SOME GREAT WE HAVE A GREAT 
TRADITION OF FANTASTIC JOURNALISM 
IN THIS COUNTRY L. L. THINK IT IS A 
SHAME IT SEE THAT SHABBY SECOND 
RATE STORIES TITILATING PEOPLE 
AREN'T THERE RULES THE PRESS 
COMPLAINTS COMMSSION DOESN'T TO 
TAKE VIEW THERE MUST BE A DIRECT 
CONNECTION USUALLY INVOLVING 
HYPOCRISY OR CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
THE NEWS OF THE WORLD IS FLYING UP 
TO THE EDGE OF RULES THIS IS A GRS 
INVASION OF BOTH THESE PEOPLE'S 
PUBLIC LIVES A GROSS INVASION 
THEY HAVE HAD THEIR PRIVACY INVADED 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THE QUESTION IS 
CAN THEY JUSTIFY IT IN THE NEWS 
OF THE WORLD'S CASE IT IS PO FACED 
BUT THEY ARE USING THE SAME 
JUSTIFICATION THAT THE PRESS NEEDS 
IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE REAL WRONG 
DOING 
WHAT IS THAT JUSTIFICATION DOING THAT THERE MIGHT BE HYPOCRISY THAT 
PEOPLE ARE BEING MISLED AT THE END 
OF THE DAY IN THE MOSLEY CASE HE 
IS GIVING LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO 
VICE GIRLS TO PROSTITUTES MUCH IT 
IS SERIOUSLY ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
IN ITS OWN RIGHT EVEN IF IT IS NOT 
ILLEGAL TO TO COMMENT ON IT AND 
DESCRIBE HOW IT IS GOING IS PART 
OF THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND WE 
HAVE BROAD PRESS CULTURE IN 
BRITAIN YOU CAN SEE THE MORE IN 
DEPTH STUFF AND WORTHY STUFF PART 
OF THAT SAME FREEDOM MEANS 
WHENEVER THERE IS A FREEDOM PEOPLE 
WILL ABUSE IT TO SOME EXTEN FOR 
PROFIT THAT'S PERHAPS WHAT IS 
GOING ON 
I WILL ASK YOU THE SAME 
QUESTION DO YOU THINK THERE IS A 
POINT WHERE WE COME TO IF YOU ARE 
IN PUBLIC LIFE OR WHETHER YOU ARE 
AN ELECTED POLITICIAN OR PERHAPS 
SOMEBODY WHO HAS A LOT OF MONEY 
RUNNING BIG BUSINESS THE PRESSURE 
IS ON NOW IN MANY WAYS TO BE 
WHITER THAN WHITE SHOULD THAT BE 
THE CASE 
I THINK IT IS A PRESSURE 
AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF EVERYONE 
WERE WE LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD IT 
IS THE HIGHEST HIP CROSSCY OF ANY 
NEWSPAPER TO SHOW THE KIND OF 
PICTURES AND PRINT THE SHABBY 
STORIES THAT SOME HAVE AND YET HAVE 
SEMI NAKED WOMEN ON THEIR INSIDE 
PAGES IT IS LIKE WELL WHO IS 
GIVE MONEY TO WHO HERE 
WHAT DO 
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THE PRESSURE 
THIS IS THE DAYS TASTEFUL END OF 
JOURNALISM BUT IT IS PRICE YOU 
ARE PAY IN WAY IN CONTINENTAL 
EUROPE OR IN FRANCE THEY HAVE 
STRICT PRIVACY LAWS THAT LED TO 
THE FACT THAT THEIR PRESIDENT 
PRESIDENT MITTERRAND WAS DYING OF 
CANCER AND THE PRESS COULDN'T 
REPORT THAT DURING AN ELECTION 
BECAUSE OF THE TIGHT WOOL THEY HAVE 
OVER ANYTHING THAT'S IN THE CLEARLY 
DEFINED BY PUBLIC DUTY IF WE WANT 
A FREE PRESS THERE WILL BE 
DISTASTEFUL RESULTS OF THAT AND 
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE I 
THINK 
O. K. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THINK NOW IT IS SEVEN FORTY THREE A M. YOU ARE WATCHING 
BEREFT BEREFT THE MAIN STORIES THERE ARE 
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THAT SHANNON 
MATTHEWS'S MOTHER HAS BEEN ARRESTED 
ON SUSPICION OF PERVERTING THE 
COURSE OF JUSTICE PRO TIBET 
DEMONSTRATORS ARE ACCUSING THE 
POLICE OF HEAVY HANDED TACTICS 
DURING YESTERDAY'S OLYMPIC TORCH 
RELAY ALSO COMING UP IN THE 
PROGRAMME A BREAKFAST EXCLUSIVE 
WE WILL HAVE THE FIRST TELEVISION 
SHOWING OF MADONNA'S NEW VIDEO LOUISE IS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT 
IT IS A COLD START TO THE DAY WE 
HAVE SOME FROST AROUND WE COULD 
HAVE SOME SUNSHINE AND SOME WINTRY 
SHOWERS WE START WITH A SEVERE 
WEATHER WARNING FOR SOME SNOW 
ANYWHERE FROM THE SCOTTISH BORDERS 
DOWN THE EAST COAST OF ENGLAND 
TOWARDS THE WASH THE OTHER PROBLEM 
THIS MORNING IS ICE THE SLIPPERY 
CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY BY NINE A M. 
ACROSS THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND THERE 
WILL BE SOME RAIN IT WILL BE WINDY 
AND THEY WILL BE SOME SNOW AS WELL 
WE RUN INTO THAT AND HAS NO RIGHT 
DOWN TOWARDS EAST ANGLIA IT WILL 
LARGELY BE ON HIGHER GROUND FROM 
THE MIDLANDS TOWARDS THE ISLE OF 
WIGHT HEADING IN THE DIRECTION OF 
GLOUCESTERSHIRE AGAIN SOME CLOUD 
SOME BREAKS AND FOR THE SOUTH WEST 
OF ENGLAND SOME SUNSHINE SNOW 
SHOWERS LIKELY ACROSS PARTS OF 
WALES THE SAME FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND SOME SNOW SHOWERS BUT ALSO 
SOME SUNSHINE AT THIS TIME OF THE 
YEAR THE SAN SAN WILL MELT THE SNOW 
THE SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES NO 
GREAT SHAKES FOR THE TIME OF YEAR 
BELOW AVERAGE MOST OF THE WINTRY 
SHOWERS WILL DIE AWAY THROUGH THIS 
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT FOR MUCH OF 
THE REST OF THE BRITISH ISLES WE 
WILL HAVE A WIDESPREAD FROST IT 
WILL BE A COLD NIGHT AHEAD A COLD 
START TO THE DAY TOMORROW 
BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE FIRST THING THE 
EMPHASIS TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE 
MORE ON RAIN SHOWERS THAN WINTRY 
SHOWERS FURTHER SNOW IN THE HILLS 
OF SCOTLAND 
DECLAN IS DOING MORE NUMBERS FOR US 
NOW NOW WE ARE EXPLAINING THESE TAX CHANGES 
THAT TOOK EFFECT OVER THE WEEKEND 
BROADLY TAX PAYERS ARE BETTER OFF 
BECAUSE THE BASIC RATE HAS FALLEN 
FROM TWENTY TWO P. IN THE POUND TO TWENTY PENCE 
IN THE POUND THE STARTING TAX RATE 
OF TEN PENCE IN THE POUND HAS BEEN 
SCRAPPED THAT MEANS LOW PAID AND 
PART TIME WORKERS ARE HIT IN THE 
POCKET JOHN WHITING THE TAX 
PARTNER FROM PRICE WATERHOUSE 
COOPER JOINS US ALONG WITH NATASHA 
BIRTLES JOHN WE ASKED YOU TO COME 
UP WITH SOME TYPICAL SCENARIOS THE 
FIRST ONE WE ARE LOOKING AT HIS TWENTY FOUR 
YEAR OLD TOM HE AND HIS WIFE DON'T 
HAVE ANY CHILDREN HE EARNS TWELVE THOUSAND 
A YEAR AND HIS WIFE EARNS FIVE THOUSAND 
PART TIME THAT GIVES THEM A 
COMBINED INCOME OF SEVENTEEN THOUSAND THEY 
ARE WORSE OFF AS A RESULT OF THIS 
TAX CHANGE BY SIXTY SEVEN THE CRITICAL 
THING IS THAT THEY ARE BOTH UNDER 
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE THEY ARE HE IS LOSING BECAUSE OF 
THIS TEN P. TAX BAND DISAPPEARING HE 
IS NOT OLD ENOUGH TO GET THE 
WORKING TAX CREDITS WHICH 
COMPENSATE FOR THAT LAST FOR A LOT 
A RELATIVELY LOW PAID WORKERS 
IF TOM WAS A YEAR OLDER HE WOULD 
QUALIFY FOR THE TAX CREDIT BUT HE 
WOULD HAVE TO REMEMBER TO CLAIM IT 
SO MANY PEOPLE DO NOT 
THAT IS THE POINT THE GOVERNMENT 
IS SAYING THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT 
BETTER BECAUSE THIS IS LOOKED AFTER 
BY THE TAX CREDIT MAYBE PEOPLE ARE 
TOO FRIGHTENED HER TOO WORRIED TAX 
CREDITS HAVE HAD A BAD PRESS A LOT 
OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED THEY WILL BE 
GIVEN TOO MUCH HE COULD BE MISSING 
OUT IF HE IS PUTTING MONEY INTO A 
PENSION FUND THE GOVERNMENT ADDS 
IN THE TAX THAT YOU WOULD HAVE PAID 
ON THE MONEY THAT YOU PUT INTO 
PENSIONS THAT MEANS THAT 
PARADOXICALLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
REDUCED THE BASIC RATE OF TAX BY 
TO TWENTY PER CENT YOU HAVE TWO PER CENT LESS GOING 
INTO YOUR PENSION FUND 
THEY DO AT A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF 
MONEY TO THE FAMILY INCOME TAX 
CREDIT IF YOU CAN BE BOTHERED TO 
CLAIM THAT 
ABSOLUTELY MAKING A YEAR OR TWO 
ALDER HE COULD PROBABLY GO FROM A 
SIXTY SEVEN LOSS TO ONE HUNDRED IN CREDIT THERE 
ARE VARIOUS COMPENSATION IS THE 
ELDERLY DO WELL ALSO 
THE CASE OF AN HOUR NOW SHE IS FIFTY SEVEN 
YEARS OLD AND R. SHE HAS TAKEN 
EARLIER RETIREMENT SHE IS WORSE 
OFF TO THE TUNE OF EIGHTY SIX SHE DOES 
NOT QUALIFY FOR A PENSION 
SHE DOES NOT SHE DOES THAT GET THE 
EXTRA THE SIXTY FIVE PLUS GAIN SHE HAS GOT 
A LITTLE SAVINGS INCOME BUT 
BASICALLY SEE IS ANOTHER CLASSIC 
CATEGORY OF SOMEBODY WHO IS WORSE 
OFF OFF YOU HAVE TO BE IN THERE YOU HAVE 
TO KNOW WHICH TAX CREDIT TO APPLY 
FOR YOU HAVE DINNER WHICH FORMS TO 
FILL IN IT IS NICE IDEA BUT 
COMPLICATED YOU HAVE TO KNOW 
GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES SO THE 
OLD SAYING GOES BUT MAYBE NOT IF 
THAT A GENTLE MAN ALSO HAPPENS TO 
BE A MILLIONAIRE A SURVEY HAS 
REVEALED THAT MOST OF THE RICHEST 
MEN ON THE PLANET PREFERRED 
BRUNETTE DOES THE EVIDENCE BACK 
THIS UP YEAR IS A LOOK AT SOME 
OTHER WIVES AND GIRLFRIENDS OF THE 
RICH AND FAMOUS HERE IS A LOOK 
THERE YOU GO JOINING US HIS KATHY 
LETTE AND LEE STAFFORD CATHY 
ALBARN IS THAT HOW I WOULD 
DESCRIBE YOU 
A LITTLE TOUCH OF RED FEISTY READ 
BLONDES HAVE MORE FUN BUT IT IS THE 
BRUNETTE WHO GETS THE MILLIONAIRE 
BLONDES HAVE MORE FUN BECAUSE 
BRUNETTE HAIR TOO BUSY WAXING AND 
SHAVING ISN'T IT STRANGE THAT GUYS 
THINK HAIR COLOUR AFFECTS OUR 
PERSONALITY PERSONALITY BLONDES TEND TO BE MORE SEXY 
BRUNETTES TEND TO BE MORE 
SOPHISTICATED IF YOU'RE SEXY 
BLONDE YOU ARE GOING TO GET MORE 
ATTENTION ATTENTION I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THAT 
SOPHISTICATED BANK BRUNETTES ARE 
MORE SOPHISTICATED JUST BY THE 
COLOUR OF THEIR HAIR 
BLONDE WOMEN GET MORE ATTENTION IF 
YOU WANT TO MARRY SOMEBODY YOU 
WOULD WANT TO MARRY SOMEBODY WHO 
DOESN'T GET SO MUCH ATTENTION 
I WENT BLONDE ONES TO DO STORY 
PEOPLE STARTED TREATING ME AS 
THOUGH MY ONLY READING MATERIAL 
WERE MY TAROT CARDS AND MY MENU 
WHY IS IT THAT BOYS ARE SO 
INFLUENCED BY SOMETHING AS 
SUPERFICIAL AS THE WAY WE LOOK IS 
IT BECAUSE YOU PREFER BEAUTY TO 
BRAINS BECAUSE YOU SEE BETTER THAN 
YOU THINK 
I THINK IT IS A CHILDLIKE THING 
THE ONLY NATURAL BLONDES ARE WHEN 
YOU'RE YOUNGER EVERYBODY GETS 
DARKER WHEN THEY GET OLDER 
DO PEOPLE COME IN AND GO FOR A 
BROWN HAIR HUMOUR THEY ALL GO FOR A 
BLONDE BLONDE WHEN I LOVE GOING BLONDE WHEN THEY 
GO BLUNT THEY WALK DOWN THE STREET 
WITH LITTLE MORE MOVEMENT THE 
HEELS GOAL LITTLE HIGHER DOES MARK 
OR INTERESTING THEY DID NOT DO 
SURVEY WITH THE RICH WOMEN 
NOBODY ASKED US IF HER COLOUR 
INFLUENCES OUR CHOICE IT GIVES THE 
IMPRESSION THAT WOMEN WERE OUT 
THERE MADLEY HUSBAND HUNTING 
MADLY HUSBAND HAD BEEN 
BRUNETTES AND THE MONEY GROVER'S 
WE MAKE OUR OWN MONEY WE DO NOT 
NEED PRINCE CHARMING TO SAVE US

LOUISE LOOKS FABULOUS BLONDE WHICH 
MIGHT LUKE MOORE SOPHISTICATED

OF MYSELF WITH BROWN HAIR L. L. HAVE 
NEVER HAD BROWN HAIR WHY DID YOU 
CHOOSE TO STAY WITH YOU OR NATURAL

TORCH RELAY TWO THOUSAND OFFICERS WERE ON 
DUTY AND THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED 
THE RELAY MOVES ON TO PARIS TODAY 
WHERE A HUGE SECURITY OPERATION IS 
BEING MOUNTED 
THIS IS THE MOMENT THE FIRST 
PROTESTERS TRIED TO DISRUPT THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY A MAN ATTEMPTS 
TO BOARD THE OFFICIAL BUS JUST 
MINUTES AFTER THE START OF ITS 
JOURNEY THROUGH LONDON THERE WAS 
CONSTANT DISRUPTION THIS MAN SET 
OFF A FIRE EXTINGUISHER IN AN 
EFFORT TO PUT THE FLAME OUT HE HE TRIED TO PUT THE FLAME OUT WITH AN 
EXTINGUISHER BECAUSE CHINA HAS NO 
RIGHT TO DO WHAT IT'S DOING 
ANOTHER TRIED TO GRAB THE TORCH 
FROM THE FORMER CHILDREN'S T. V. 
PRESENTER KONNIE HUQ TWO THOUSAND 
OFFICERS WERE DEPLOYED AND THEY 
WERE SWIFT TO ACT BUT SOME 
DEMONSTRATORS ACCUSED THEM OF BEING 
HEAVY HANDED SO ROUGH DAY FOR 
THE POLICE AND THIS MORNING'S 
PAPERS MAKE UNCOMFORTABLE READING 
TOO WITH THE TIMES SAYING THEY 
WERE HUMILIATED WHILE OTHERS USE 
WORDS LIKE MAYHEM AND FARCE TO 
DESCRIBE THE PROCEEDINGS BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAVE PRAISED THE 
HANDLING OF THE EVENT AND THE MET 
THEMSELVES SAY THERE IS A FINE LINE 
TO TREAD BETWEEN ALLOWING PEACEFUL 
PROTESTS AND THE DISRUPTION OF 
SHOWCASE EVENT 
WHAT YOU DO TO 
TIBET PLEASE GORDON BROWN I URGE 
YOU 
DESPITE THE PROBLEMS THE YOU TORCH FINALLY ARRIVED AT GREENWICH 
WHERE DAME KELLY HOST LIT THE 
OLYMPIC CALDRON RUNNING OFF A

OF HARMONY BUT ENDED UP IN DISCORD 
HERE ON BREAKFAST IN A FEW MINUTES 
WE'LL BE TALKING TO KONNIE HUQ WHO 
WAS PART OF THAT TORCH RELAY AND 
ONE OF THE SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS 
IN CHARGE OF THAT OPERATION THAT'S 
IN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES 
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WILL BE THE 
BIGGEST LOSERS FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO ABOLISH 
THE TME PANY RATE OF TAX ACCORDING 
TO A GROUP OF M. P.'S OUT THIS MORNING 
THERE IS GROWING DISCONTENT AMONG 
LABOUR BACKBENCHERS ABOUT IT LET'S 
TALK TO CAROLE WALKER GOOD MORNING 
THIS DECISION WAS ANNOUNCED A LONG 
TIME AGO BUT HAS ONLY COME INTO 
EFFECT WHY ARE WE ONLY WORKING OUT 
THE EFFECTS NOW 
BECAUSE I THINK 
FRANKLY PEOPLE ARE FEELING THE 
EFFECTS OF IT YES YOU'RE RIGHT 
THIS WAS ANNOUNCED IN GORDON 
BROWN'S LAST BUDGET AS CHANCELLOR 
BUT IT HAS NOW COME INTO FORCE AND 
AN AWFUL LOT OF CONSTITUENTS ARE 
COMPLAINING TO THEIR M. P.'S ABOUT IT 
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS ALTHOUGH THE 
BASIC RATE HAS BEEN CUT FROM TWENTY TWO TO 
TWENTY P. AT THE SAME TIME THE TEN P. RATE 
HAS BEEN ABOLISHED THERE IS A 
SPECIFIC GROUP TYPICALLY FAMILIES 
WITHOUT CHILDREN EARNING LESS THAN 
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WHO ARE LOSING OUT WE HAVE 
THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE TODAY 
SAYING IT'S UNREASONABLE FOR THEM 
TO HAVE TO PAY MORE PARTICULARLY 
AS THEY'RE THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT IS KEEN TO ENSURE 
CARRY ON WORKING AND DON'T FALL 
BACK ON TO BENEFITS LABOUR LABOUR BACKBENCHERS UNHAPPY ABOUT IT BUT 
CAN THEY FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO 
CHANGE ITS MIND 
THERE IS QUITE A 
HEAD OF STEAM BUILDING UP ON THIS 
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE SUFFERING ARE 
ESSENTIALLY LABOUR'S CORE VOTERS 
AND THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T GOING 
THROUGH A GOOD PATCH SOME M. P.'S ARE 
PRETTY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR SEATS 
ALTHOUGH IT'S COME INTO FORCE AND 
THE BUSINESS SOAKTRY JOHN HUTTON 
WAS SAYING THERE IS NO CHANCE OF 
UNPICKING IT AT THIS STAGE LABOUR 
M. P.'S ARE GOING TO TRY TO FORCE A 
VOTE ON IT WHEN THE BILL COMES 
BEFORE THE COMMONS IN A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS' TIME AS THINGS STAND THE 
GOVERNMENT COULD BE FACING A 
SUBSTANTIAL REBELLION

ARE EXPECTED TO APPEAR AT FORFAR 
SHERIFF COURT TODAY THE HEAD OF 
THE VICTIM A MIGRANT WORKER WAS 
FOUND WRAPPED IN PLASTIC ON 
ARBROATH BEACH LAST WEEK 
HOSPITAL ROYAL HAMPSHIRE COUNTY 
HOSPITAL HOSPITALS SHOULD LEARN 
TO SAY SORRY MORE OFTEN THE 
HEALTHCARE COMMISSION SAYS WHILE 
IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY N. H. S. 
TRUSTS IN THE WAY THEY HANDLE 
MISTAKES IMPROVEMENT IN CARE CAN 
BE MADE BY A SIMPLE APOLOGY 
RELATE RELATE 
CLAIMS MILLIONS OF POUNDS IN 
COMPENSATION CHRIS BUCKLER IS 
OUTSIDE THE HIGH COURT IN BELFAST 
GOOD MORNING CHRIS 
GOOD MORNING IT IS OF COURSE 
JUST A FEW MONTHS SINCE THE OMAGH 
FAMILIES WERE LAST AT COURT THIS 
CIVIL ACTION IS RATHER DIFFERENT TO 
THIS CRIMINAL CASE THEY'RE 
CLAIMING AROUND TEN MILLION FIVE 
MEN THEY ALLEGE WERE IN THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE REAL I. R. A. IN 
AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THOSE ARE CHARGES AND 
ALLEGATIONS THEY'LL FIGHT DURING 
THIS CIVIL ACTION AS YOU SAY IT'S 
TECHNICALLY ABOUT MONEY BUT IT'S 
REALLY ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
FOR THE FAMILIES THEY SAY IT'S NOT 
ABOUT POUNDS BUT PRINCIPLE THEY 
WANT SOMEONE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR 
THE ATTACK IN AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT A DAY 
THEY CAN NEVER FORGET 
TWENTY NINE PEOPLE AND UNBORN TWINS DIED AS 
A RESULT OF THE OMAGH BOMBING THE 
ATTACK WAS THE SUBJECT OF A HUGE 
POLICE INVESTIGATION BUT SO FAR 
NO ONE HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF THE 
MURDERS 
THIS IS A WRIT FOR YOUR MURDERS SON SEAMUS 
SIX YEARS AGO 
SOLICITORS ACTING FOR THE FAMILIES 
OF THE VICTIMS SERVED WRITS AGAINST 
FIVE MEN THEY BELIEVE THEY WERE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXPLOSION 
THEY'RE COLIN MURPHY WHO IS 
CURRENTLY AWAITING A RETRIAL IN THE 
REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ON CONSPIRACY 
CHARGES LINKED TO THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT ATTACK 
LIAM CAMPBELL SEAMUS DALY SEAMUS 
AND MICHAEL MCKINETTE IN THE HIGH 
COURT THE FAMILIES ARE CLAIMING 
COMPENSATION OF MORE THAN TEN 
MILLION 
I THINK THAT REALLY MONEY MILLION IS THE LAST THING ON OUR MINDS AS 
I HAVE SAID WE HAVE SEEN AND BEEN 
INSIDE SO MANY COURTS OVER THE LAST 
TEN YEARS AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 
THE FAMILIES AT LEAST TO GET A 
VERDICT AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR 
CASE IS STRONG AND WE WILL HOLD 
PEOPLE TO ACCOUNT WHICH HASN'T 
HAPPENED SO FAR IN OMAGH 
THE ONLY 
PERSON CHARGED WITH MURDER WAS 
CLEARED OF ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
BOMBING LAST YEAR CONCERNS ABOUT 
THE EVIDENCE IN THAT TRIAL MEANS 
ANOTHER CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IS 
UNLIKELY MAKING THIS CIVIL CASE A 
LAST CHANCE FOR JUSTICE FOR THE 
FAMILIES SOME RELATIVES HAVE FOUND 
THE DELAY IN GETTING TO COURT VERY 
DIFFICULT AND VERY FRUSTRATING 
SOME HAVE EVEN DROPPED OUT OF THIS 
CIVIL ACTION BUT THE FAMILIES THAT 
REMAIN WILL COME TO THE COURT HERE 
WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS TO 
BEGIN THIS CIVIL ACTION THERE IS 
AN ONGOING ISSUE ABOUT EVIDENCE 
THEY WANT EVIDENCE FROM IRISH 
POLICE OFFICERS AND THERE IS A 
DIFFICULTY THERE THERE IS AN 
ONGOING THE IRISH AUTHORITIES 
BELIEVE THEY STILL MAY HAVE A 
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IN THE FUTURE 
THAT COULD JEOPARDISE THINGS SOME 
OF THAT SEEMS TO BE SOLVED BUT THE 
FAMILIES CONTINUE TO FIGHT ABOUT 
THAT DESPITE THAT THE CIVIL ACTION 
WILL GET UNDER WAY TODAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
SCIENTISTS IN AMERICA SAY THEY MAY 
HAVE FOUND A NEW WAY TO TREAT 
SUPERBUGS SUCH AS MRSA BY USING 
ALLIGATOR BLOOD RESEARCHERS SAY 
ANTI BODIES IN THE BLOOD HELPED 
ALLIGATORS RECOVER VERY QUICKLY IF 
THEY'RE INJURED IN TERRITORIAL 
BATTLES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY 
DO COME INTO CONTACT WITH BACTERIA 
IN DIRTY WATER THAT COULD HELP 
THEM DEAL WITH DIRTY THINGS LIKE 
MRSA THE RELAY OF THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH WAS CHAOTIC AND AT TIMES 
ALMOST SURREAL VARIOUS CELEBRITIES 
FLANKED BY HUNDREDS OF BRITISH 
POLICE AND CHINESE SECURITY MEN 
MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH LONDON AS 
PRO TIBET SUPPORTERS DID THEIR BEST 
TO STOP THEM THE FORMER BLUE PETER 
PRESENTER KONNIE HUQ WAS ONE OF THE 
TORCH BEARERS AND SHE JOINS US THIS 
MORNING 
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING 
RECOVERED I HOPE YEAH 
FIRST LET'S YEAH LOOK AT THE MOMENT A DEMONSTRATOR 
TRIED TO SNATCH THE FLAME KONNIE KONNIE HUQ NOW AS I SPEAK SOMEONE HAS 
TRIED TO GRAB THE TORCH FROM THE 
BLUE PETER PRESENTER SOMEONE A 
MAN HAS TRIED TO GRAB THE TORCH 
HE HAS BEEN HAULED TO THE GROUND BY 
POLICE OFFICERS HE DID HAVE HIS 
HANDS ON THE TORCH FOR A FEW 
SECONDS 
SHE'S HERE WITH US IN THE SECONDS STUDIO THESE THE FIRST TIME YOU 
HAVE SEEN THOSE PICTURES ACTUALLY 
YEAH TELL US WHAT HAPPENED FROM 
YOUR POINT OF VIEW WELL ACTUALLY 
IT ALL SEEMED TO BE GOING FINE 
BECAUSE OUR LEG WAS QUITE EARLY ON 
IN THE DAY ELEVEN HUNDRED A M. ROUGHLY AND 
IT WAS OUT OF THE WAY SORT OF IN 
LADBROKE GROVE AND THERE DIDN'T 
SEEM TO BE MANY PROTESTERS AT ALL 
AND THE CROWDS WERE REALLY GOOD 
THERE WAS BAND PLAYING AND 
EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE GOING 
REALLY SMOOTHLY BUT THEN FROM OUT 
OF NO WHERE THIS GUY GOT THROUGH 
AND WAS WRESTLING ME FOR THE TORCH 
AND 
TRYING TO HOLD ON 
AND 
THEN LIKE LOADS OF SECURITY 
DESCENDED UPON THE SKIRMISH AND 
THEN LOADS OF POLICEMEN AND THEN 
IT WAS JUST LIKE WHOA BIT OF A SCUFFLE 
WE ALSO CAN SEE FROM THE SCUFFLE CLIP THERE ARE THESE CHINESE WHAT 
SECURITY GUARDS SURROUNDING YOU AS 
WELL THE PEOPLE IN BLUE WHAT WERE 
THEY DOING 
THEY SORT OF TRAVEL 
WITH THE TORCH EVERYWHERE I GUESS 
THEY FORM A RING AROUND THE TORCH 
I GUESS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT KNOW 
THAT HIGH SECURITY MEASURES ARE 
NEEDED SO THEY SEEM TO GO 
EVERYWHERE WITH THE TORCH AND YEAH 
THEY'RE QUITE DETERMINED AND QUITE 
FULL ON 
SO WERE YOU HOLDING ON TO 
IT AS WELL 
I KNOW IT WAS LIKE 
I'M NOT LETTING GO OF THIS THING 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE PROTESTERS 
WHO SAY BY HAVING THIS IN LONDON 
IT'S AN ENDORSEMENT OF CHINA'S 
RECORDS ON HUMAN RIGHTS WHAT'S 
YOURS RESPONSE TO THAT 
I DON'T 
THINK IT'S AN ENDORSEMENT OF CHINA 
BY SUPPORTING THE OLYMPICS THE 
OLYMPIC 
ETHOS 
IT'S A GOOD THING L. DO THINK IT'S 
GREAT THAT PEOPLE CAN SPEAK OUT AND 
PROTEST AND MAKE THEIR VOICE KNOWN 
PEOPLE COULDN'T DO THAT IN CHINA 
FOR INSTANCE THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE 
ARRESTED AND MAYBE TORTURED SO BY 
VOICING PEOPLE'S OPINIONS IF IT 
ACTUALLY MANAGES TO GET SOME CHANGE 
TO OCCUR THEN SURELY IT'S A GOOD 
THING IT'S VERY EARLY ON IN THE 
TORCH'S JOURNEY IT'S GOING TO BE 
TRAVELLING UNTIL AUGUST IT'S IN 
FRANCE TODAY L. THINK THIS COULD 
JUST BE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG 
WITH REGARDS TO SECURITY YOU HAD 
THE CHINESE PEOPLE SURROUNDING YOU 
ALSO POLICE AS WELL WHAT WOULD YOU 
SAY ABOUT THE SECURITY ALONG THE 
ROUTE WAS THAT WELL HANDLED AS FAR 
AS YOU COULD SEE 
I MEAN THERE WAS 
A BIG SECURITY PREN AND IT'S A 
REALLY LONG ROUTE ALL THE WAY FROM 
WEMBLEY TO GREENWICH SO IT'S A 
REALLY DIFFICULT THING TO POLICE 
AND I DO THINK THERE WAS A BIG 
SECURITY PRESENCE BUT THEN THAT 
MIGHT HAVE FELT INTIMIDATING TO 
PEOPLE AND MIGHT HAVE I DON'T 
KNOW HOW MUCH THAT HAMPERED THE 
WHOLE RELAY 
O. K. THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING 
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT TOOK PART 
IN THOSE DONSTRATIONS YESTERDAY 
HAVE ACCUSED THE POLICE OF BEING 
HEAVY HANDED LET'S TALK TO THE 
HEAD OF YESTERDAY'S OPERATION BY 
THE POLICE BOB BROADHURST WHO 
JOINS US FROM SCOTLAND YARD THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US IT 
WAS A DIFFICULT OPERATION FOR THE 
POLICE REALLY IN ONE SENSE YOU HAD 
TO ALLOW THE DEMONSTRATION TO GO 
AHEAD ALSO YOU HAD TO GET THE 
FLAME ALONG ITS ROUTE DO YOU FEEL 
OVERALL IT WAS A SUCCESS 
I THINK 
WE SET OUT TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE WOULD 
LAST WEEK WE GOT THE TORCH FROM 
WEMBLEY THIRTY ONE MILES TO GREENWICH EIGHTY ONE 
RUNNERS RAN THAT ROUTE THEY HANDED 
OVER SUCCESSFULLY YOU SAW THE 
INCIDENT WITH KONNIE HUQ SHE WAS 
ASSAULTED THE TORCH WAS ATTACKED 
SOMEONE TRIED TO STEAL IT ALONG 
ITS ROUTE WE HAD TO DEAL WITH A 
NUMBER OF INCIDENTS LIKE THAT DO DO YOU MAKE OF THE CRITICISM FROM 
PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE YESTERDAY WHO 
SAY THE POLICE WERE HEAVY HANDED I I DON'T THINK WE WERE AT ALL YOU SAW 
THE ATTACK ON HER YOU SAW THE 
PICTURES OF PEOPLE ATTACKING IT 
WITH FIRE EXTINGUISHERS THAT COULD 
HAVE BEEN ANY SORT OF WEAPON FOR 
ALL WE KNEW THAT'S WHY I HAD TO 
HAVE MY OFFICERS OUT THIRTY ONE MILES 
WORTH OF RUNNING JOGGING AND 
CYCLING ALONGSIDE IT THOSE 
OFFICERS DESERVE MEDALS FOR WHAT 
THEY DID 
THE TROUBLE WAS IT WASN'T 
UPLIFTING FOR THE OLYMPIC IDEAL WAS 
IT 
WE SAW DEMONSTRATORS CHECKING THAT 
TORCH FROM WEMBLEY TO GREENWICH AND 
THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN AT ANY 
OPPORTUNITY TO GRAB IT WE NOT 
ALLOW THAT 
HENCE THE 
YOU SAW HE DID 
HAVE ONE 
MOMENT 
WHERE YOU 
HAD TO 
TAKE THE 
BLAME OFF 
THE 
STREETS AND 
PUT IT 
ON BOARD 
THE BUS 
WASN'T THAT 
A BIT OF 
A RETREAT NOT AT ALL WE HAD ALWAYS 
SAID THAT 
WAS PART OF 
CONTINGENCIES WHAT I 
DID NOT WANT 
TO DO 
WAS THE 
UNSEEMLY SIGHT 
OF 
OFFICERS FIGHTING THEIR WAY THROUGH 
WE PUT 
FOR A 
FEW MINUTES 
WHILE WE 
GOT THE 
CROWD 
BACK UNDER 
CONTROL AND THEN CARRIED 
ON RUNNING 
IF THE CROWDS WERE SO 
DIFFICULT WHY WERE THERE ONLY THIRTY SEVEN 
ARRESTS 
LET'S PUT IT IN ARRESTS PERSPECTIVE THERE WERE THOUSANDS 
OF PROTESTERS ON THE STREETS WHO 
PROTESTED LAWFULLY THEY WERE NOISY 
AND VOCIFEROUS THEY DID EXACTLY 
WHAT PROTESTERS SHOULD DO AS EVER 
THE EVENT WAS PUT A RELATIVELY 
SMALL NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE 
WHO DID 
THEIR BEST 
TO STEAL 
THE TORCH THEY 
THEIR BEST TO STEAL THE TORCH THEY WERE DEALT WITH 
IF THE 
DEMONSTRATORS WERE THAT DIFFICULT 
HOW IS IT THAT SO FEW ARRESTS WERE 
MADE 
THAT IS SEVEN ARRESTS ALL MADE FOR MINOR PUBLIC ORDER OFFENCES 
THOSE WERE FOR PEOPLE 
TRYING TO 
ATTACK THE 
TORCH I THINK 
THAT IS 
TESTIMONY 
TO THE 
THOUSANDS OF 
PROTESTERS WHO 
CAME OUT AND 
THE LAW 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU'RE WATCHING BREAKFAST COMING 
UP UP WE MEET THESE MASAI WARRIORS AND 
FIND OUT WHY RUNNING IN 
THE LONDON 
MARATHON COULD CHANGE LIFE IN THEIR 
VILLAGE 
SHE HAS SOMETHING TO SHATTER THAT 
NOW THE ACTRESS AND SINGER CLAIRE 
SWEENEY WILL 
BE 
HERE TO 
TELL 
ABOUT HER 
NEW MUSICAL CELEBRATING 
THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS ON YOUR LOCAL 
CONKER 
TREES THEY 
THINK IT 
IS 
CAUSED BY A BACTERIA THAT IS 
AFFECTING 
HALF THE 
CONKER TREES 
IN 
THIS COUNTRY 
WE WILL 
EXPLAIN MORE 
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES FIRST THE WEATHER 
WITH CAROL 
I CAN 
HEAR THE THEY HAVE 
BEEN GOING 
AT IT 
MORNING IT IS A 
COLD MORNING 
TODAY WE ARE LOOKING 
AT SOME 
SHOWERS AND SOME SUNSHINE ALMOST 
ANYWHERE WE HAVE A SEVERE WEATHER 
WARNING FOR HEAVY SNOW LARGELY 
ACROSS EASTERN ENGLAND AND LARGELY 
TO HIGHER GROUND TO LOWER LEVELS 
WE WILL 
BE LOOKING AT 
SEA IN 
LAST 
OF HOURS 
WE HAVE 
HAD A 
BIT OF SNOW 
YOU CAN SEE 
IT FROM 
THE BLUE ON THE CHART SOME 
TEMPERATURES 
ARE STILL 
TEMPERATURES ARE STILL BELOW FREEZING 
AND SO THEY 
COULD BE 
ICY 
PATCHES ON UNTREATED SURFACES 
ACROSS THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND 
IT IS 
WINDY WE ALSO 
HAVE RAIN 
AND SNOW 
TO 
HIGHER GROUND 
SUNSHINE 
THE 
SOUTHERN UPLANDS 
AND THE NORTH 
ENGLAND 
IN THE 
EAST OF ENGLAND 
WE ARE 
EXPECTING THIS 
KNOW 
I'D HAVE GOT THE SNOW FROM THE 
MIDLANDS TOWARDS THE ISLE 
OF WIGHT 
HEADING INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND 
VARIABLE AMOUNTS 
OF CLOUD 
WE ARE 
QUITE A BIT IN LONDON IT 
BRIGHT 
OR INDEED 
SUNNI AND 
WE ARE 
NOT IMMUNE TO THOSE WINTRY SHOWERS 
NEITHER ARE WE ACROSS WALES WE ARE 
THERE AS 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND 
SOME SNOW 
ON THE 
HILLS AND 
SOME 
WINTRY SHOWERS 
TO LOWER 
THROUGH 
THE DAY 
THE WINTRY 
SHOWERS 
COULD POP UP 
ALMOST ANYWHERE 
NOT 
EVERYWHERE WILL 
GET THEM 
SOME OF 
US

DRY 
THERE WILL 
BE 
SOME 
SUNSHINE WHEN 
THE SUN 
COMES 
OUT IT

ANYTHING THAT 
IS 
LYING TO LOWER LEVELS EIGHT 
DEGREES THE TOP TEMPERATURE IS 
BELOW AVERAGE 
FOR THE TIME OF 
YEAR THIS 
EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT 
YEAR THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT MANY 
OF THE 
WINTRY SHOWERS 
WILL 
MANY OF THE WINTRY SHOWERS WILL TEND 
TO EASE 
OFF WE WILL 
HAVE 
AND 
SNOW COMING 
INTO THE 
CAN SEE 
FOR THE 
REST OF 
US INDICATES 
WE ARE EXPECTING A WIDESPREAD 
SO TOMORROW WILL 
BE A 
COLD START 
TO THE DAY 
BUT WHERE 
THE CLOUD 
BROKEN 
AND WE 
HAVE THE 
FROST IT 
WILL BE 
A BEAUTIFUL 
ONE AS 
WITH A FAIR 
BIT OF 
TOMORROW THERE WILL 
SHOWERS AROUND 
BUT FEWER THAN TODAY 
THE 
EMPHASIS ON 
DE MOURA'S 
WITH IS 
BE MORE 
RAIN 
THAN OF SLEET 
OR 
SNOW EXCEPT 
ACROSS THE 
NORTH OF SCOTLAND 
ONCE AGAIN WE 
WILL SEE 
SOME 
BUT TEMPERATURES 
CLIMBING UP A 
LITTLE ON 
TODAY A MAXIMUM TEN OR ELEVEN 
PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM PARKINSON'S 
DISEASE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH HELP 
ACCORDING TO THAT ACCORDING TO 
THE COUNTRY'S 
LARGEST 
EVER SURVEY 
INTO THE 
DISEASE WHICH 
FOUND THAT 
A 
QUARTER 
OF SUFFERERS 
ARE MISSING 
OUT ON 
SPECIALIST CARE 
LET'S TALK 
TO 
JANE SMITH 
WHO WAS DIAGNOSED IN 
TWO THOUSAND SIX AND JANE ASHER PRESIDENT OF 
THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE SOCIETY 
JANE 
PARKINSON'S DISEASE 
JANE PARKINSON'S DISEASE EVERYBODY 
KNOWS ABOUT 
IT BUT 
ENTIRELY 
SURE WHAT 
IT DOES TO YOU 
IT ACTUALLY SLOWS 
THE 
MAIN SYMPTOMS 
ARE 
FEELING LIKE YOU 
ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN SLOW MOTION 
TREMORS WEAKNESS ON ONE PARTICULAR 
SIDE MINE IS MY LEFT DIFFICULTIES 
WITH WALKING SOME PEOPLE HAVE 
DIFFICULTIES CONCENTRATING AS WELL 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT 
COMES FROM 
NO MY UNCLE HAD IT ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE 
I COULD 
NOT RECALL 
IT HEREDITARY 
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS IT 
COULD BE 
ENVIRONMENTAL THEY SAY AS NOBODY 
REALLY KNOWS 
WHAT CAUSES IT 
WHAT IS 
INTERESTING MEETING 
YOU 
JANE 
IS THAT 
THIS IS 
NOT AN OLD 
PERSON'S DISEASE IT TENDS TO BE 
MORE 
OLDER PEOPLE 
JANE IS 
RELATIVELY UNUSUAL IT 
DOES TEND 
BE THE 
OVER SIXTIES BUT 
NOT ALWAYS 
SOME 
DOES TEND TO BE OLD PEOPLE PEOPLE 
SO THIS 
WILL 
BE AN 
ESCALATING PROBLEM 
WHEN 
WE TALK 
ABOUT PEOPLE 
NOT GETTING 
THE 
SPECIALIST CARE THEY 
NEED WHAT IS 
THAT CARE JANE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS 
A PRIME 
EXAMPLE OF 
SOMEONE WHO 
HAS 
HAD THAT SPECIALIST CARE 
SHE HAS 
HAD A 
MONTH 
SHE HAS SEEN 
NEUROLOGIST 
WHO ARE 
SORTED 
OUT HER 
DRUG REGIME BUT PEOPLE ARE NOT 
BEING REFERRED TO IT THERAPISTS OF 
VARIOUS KINDS LIKE OCCUPATIONAL 
THERAPISTS AND PSYCHOTHERAPISTS 
YOU NEED TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST WITH 
SOME KNOWLEDGE 
OF PARKINSON'S 
SOME KNOWLEDGE OF PARKINSON'S BECAUSE IT IS A 
COMPLEX CONDITION 
BE SORTED OUT TO 
BE SUITABLE 
YOU AND TO BE MANAGED CORRECTLY 
THE 
TOOK ME 
FIVE YEARS TO ACTUALLY GET 
DIAGNOSED GOING 
BACKWARDS AND 
FORWARDS TO THE DOCTORS THINGS 
DIAGNOSE LIKE TENNIS ELBOW 
ARTHRITIS GENERAL WEAR AND TEAR 
SO 
IT ACTUALLY 
TOOK 
PROBABLY FIVE 
YEARS TO GET 
PROPERLY DIAGNOSED 
YEARS TO GET PROPERLY DIAGNOSED SO YOU 
HAVE REALLY 
HAD IT FOR 
SIX 
YEARS BUT DIAGNOSED THE TWO YES YES 
G. P. 
SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT 
IF THEY 
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT 
IS GOING 
THEY 
SHOULD REFER 
TO THAT 
REFER 
THE PATIENT 
VERY QUICKLY 
SOMEBODY 
WHO KNOWS 
TO 
NEUROLOGIST WHO 
HAS SOME KNOWLEDGE 
OF IT 
BUT ALSO WE ARE 
VERY KEEN 
THAT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 
TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE 
DOOR TO 
THE SORT 
OF KNOWLEDGE 
AWARENESS THAT WILL HELP AND TO 
ACCESS PERHAPS A PARKINSON'S 
DISEASE NURSE 
SPECIALIST IF 
YOU ARE 
LUCKY WHAT LUCKY THAT WERE MISSED IN YOUR CASE 
EARLY SYMPTOMS WERE TREMOR AT 
FIRST THEY SAID I COULD HAVE 
ESSENTIAL TREMOR WHICH IS QUITE 
COMMON SO THEY WERE THE MAIN 
SYMPTOMS REALLY AS 
I SAID 
THE 
SLOWNESS OF 
MOVEMENT BUT THAT 
WASN'T PICKED UPON 
IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO DIAGNOSE NOBODY IS SAYING ALL 
G. P. SHOULD 
THEY 
PEOPLE TO SOMEBODY WOULD 
BE ABLE TO 
PEOPLE TO SOMEBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE IT BECAUSE 
EVENTUALLY GET TO 
SEE THE 
NEUROLOGIST 
IT ONLY 
TOOK TWENTY 
MINUTES TO ACTUALLY 
GET A 
MINUTES TO ACTUALLY GET A DIAGNOSIS ALL 
TESTS WERE 
AND DOING THIS WITH 
WALKING 
UP AND 
DOWN 
JUST 
IN THAT 
SPACE OF TIME THEY 
SAID YOU HAVE 
THEY GOT 
WHEN YOU 
GET IN THE 
RIGHT PLACE IT 
IS 
VERY QUICK 
VERY OFTEN SOMEBODY 
WITH PARKINSON'S 
WILL SIGN 
NAME 
VERY SMALL 
THAT IS A KEY 
NAME VERY SMALL THAT IS A KEY INDICATION 
I WAS TOLD TO DO THIS INDICATION WITH 
MY FINGERS 
AND 
I COULD 
MOVE 
MY FINGERS 
AT ALL BEFORE THE 
MEDICATION JANE 
SMITH JANE 
ASHER MEDICATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
COLLECTING CONKERS IS 
A WONDERFUL 
CHILDHOOD MEMORY 
FOR LOTS OF 
BUT 
SOON THEY 
COULD BE 
A BIT HARDER 
TO FIND 
WHICH 
MEANS NO 
MORE 
THAT OLD 
FUN GAME 
SCIENTISTS ARE 
WARNING THAT HUNDREDS 
OF THOUSANDS 
OF HORSE CHESTNUT TREES 
ARE IN 
DANGER OF 
BEING AFFECTED 
AND 
DANGER OF BEING AFFECTED AND DESTROYED BY DEADLY BACTERIUM 
RICHARD WESTCOTT 
CAN TELL 
US MORE 
WHERE ARE YOU RICHARD 
GOOD MORNING I'M JUST DOWN HERE 
LOOK AT THIS HORSE CHESTNUT TREE 
IT 
LOOKS PRETTY HEALTHY THERE 
BUDS 
ON THE 
END OF THE 
BRANCHES 
YOU CAN 
PROBABLY SEE 
IT WILL 
PROBABLY FLOWER 
THIS YEAR 
BUT IF 
YOU COME 
IN CLOSE 
YOU 
CAN SEE 
THIS 
RED 
RUSTY MARK 
KING HERE 
A SIGN THAT THERE 
IS A 
INSIDE THE 
TREE AND 
IT IS 
IT 
THREATENING HUNDREDS 
OF THOUSANDS 
THREATENING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HORSE CHESTNUT 
TREES PAULINE 
A COUPLE 
OF MINUTES IF 
YOU SEE 
THIS ON 
TREE FIRST 
OF ALL 
HERE IS A SHORT 
FILM FILM I KNOW THEY DON'T LOOK 
BUT THEY 
ARE KILLING THIS CONKER 
TREE A 
WIND HAS 
NOW OPENED UP ON 
THE TRUNK A WOUND PARDON MY 
FRENCH BUT 
THIS IS 
A BLEEDING 
CANKER CAUSED 
BY THE 
BACTERIA 
YES IT IS CAUSED BY THIS BACTERIUM 
PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE WHAT 
PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE IS THAT IT HAS 
PENETRATED THE 
BARK AND 
GET THIS BLEEDING 
AND THIS RUSTY 
AREA SHOWS 
IT IS A VERY RECENT 
BLEED THEN 
THAT THE 
BACTERIUM 
IS KILLING THE 
PARK UNDERNEATH 
AND 
WHAT WE'RE 
SEEING IS 
EXTERIOR SYMPTOMS OF THIS BLEEDING MORE 
THAN A 
MILLION CONKER 
TREES IN 
BRITAIN CHANCES 
ARE YOU 
WALKED 
PAST ONE TODAY 
THE FORESTRY 
COMMISSION'S SURVEY 
SUGGESTS HALF 
COMMISSION'S SURVEY SUGGESTS HALF COULD BE 
AFFECTED BY 
THIS 
THERE IS A GREAT STORY 
BEHIND THESE 
TWO HORSE CHESTNUT 
TWO HORSE CHESTNUT TREES PLANTED AND 
TWENTY YEARS 
AGO BY THE 
DAUGHTERS 
OF A 
FORESTER THEY 
BOTH PUT 
ARE TODAY 
IT 
IS A 
GOOD EXAMPLE 
OF 
THE RANDOMNESS OF THIS DISEASE TREES IDENTICAL 
SIDE BY 
TREES IDENTICAL SIDE BY SIDE IT MAY 
NOT LOOK 
THIS ONE 
AND THAT ONE HAS SURVIVED 
REMEMBER THIS THE DUTCH ELM 
DISEASE EPIDEMIC WHICH EXPLODED IN 
THE 
SIXTIES SPREAD BY BEATLES 
FLATTENED THE LANDSCAPE WE LOST 
THIRTY 
FLATTENED THE LANDSCAPE WE LOST THIRTY MILLION 
TREES IN 
THIS 
OUTBREAK IS 
ON A MUCH 
SMALLER 
SCALE AT 
THE MOMENT THERE 
IS NO 
WAY OF 
TREATING THIS 
DISEASE BUT 
IT IS NOT ALL BAD NEWS 
FOR OTHER 
FOR OTHER TREES 
THE BLEEDING 
IS VERY LIMITED 
OF THE TREE 
AND 
DOESN'T SEEM 
TO 
MUCH 
AND THOSE TREES SURVIVE 
AND 
EVEN 
SHOW SIGNS 
OF 
RECOVERY SO 
JUST 
BECAUSE YOU 
SEE SOME 
DOESN'T 
NECESSARILY MEAN IT IS A 
DEATH SENTENCE 
SO IF 
YOU ARE 
DEATH SENTENCE SO IF YOU ARE A SCHOOL 
KID DON'T WORRY 
THERE WILL 
STILL BE PLENTY 
OF THIS GOING ON 
THIS YEAR 
PAULINE INTRODUCED TO 
FROM THE 
TREE COUNCIL A 
AWARENESS 
OF TREES AND 
SO ON 
PEOPLE GO 
OUT AND FIND 
THIS KIND 
THING ON 
THEIR 
TREES WHAT 
SHOULD 
THEY DO THE FIRST THINK 
IS DON'T 
PANIC IN 
THE WORDS 
ADAMS IF 
A TREE 
HAS BLEEDING 
CANKER AS THIS 
ONE DOES 
THAT 
CANKER AS THIS ONE DOES THAT DOESN'T 
AUTOMATICALLY MEAN 
GOING TO DIE 
YOU JUST 
NEED TO KEEP 
A VERY CAREFUL 
EYE ON IT IF 
TREE 
IS HEALTHY 
IT WILL 
RECOVER 
IT DEPENDS 
ON ALL 
SORTS OF 
OTHER FACTORS LIKE 
LIKE IN 
THE SUMMER 
WHETHER 
IT HAS LEAF 
MINER JUST 
KEEP AN EYE 
ON IT 
BUT IF 
IT DOES 
GET QUITE 
PROLIFIC AND 
HAS 
A LOT OF 
CANKER 
ON IT 
THEN 
PROBABLY NEED TO CALL IN PROFESSIONAL TREE 
SURGEON TO 
ADVISE 
YOU 
ACROSS THE 
YOU ACROSS THE COUNTRY HOW SERIOUS A 
PROBLEM COULD THIS 
BE WE 
HAVE SEEN 
PICTURES OF 
THE DUTCH 
ELM EPIDEMIC I 
THINK A 
LOT OF PEOPLE 
WILL COMPARE 
IT WITH THAT 
AND IT 
IS 
NOT ON THE 
SAME 
SCALE AT ALL 
IT IS 
NOT ON THE SAME SCALE AT ALL IT IS NOT SPREAD 
IN THE SAME WAY 
THE BIG 
VERY 
LIMBS 
SPREAD IN 
DUTCH ELM 
DISEASE CAUSED THE DEATH MILLIONS OF TREES THIS IS A 
BACTERIUM THEREFORE 
THE WAY IT 
BACTERIUM THEREFORE THE WAY IT SPREADS 
COULD BE YOU 
WON TREE 
ANOTHER AND 
ONE OF 
HABIT AND ONE 
WILL NOT 
WE HAVE TO 
HOPE THAT 
STRONG 
TREES WILL SURVIVE 
AND THAT 
WE CAN 
PROPAGATE FROM THOSE 
AND 
WE CAN PROPAGATE FROM THOSE AND THEY WILL BE RESISTANT 
ALL HAVE 
BEEN GIVING YOU 
MY 
HAVE BEEN GIVING YOU MY CONKER FACTS YOU HAVE BEEN SO IMPRESSED

ACCIDENTALLY CLASHED FACES WHILE 
ONE IN TEN WERE SO FLUSTERED THEY 
ENDED UP WAVING INSTEAD HOW DO YOU

THE QUESTION QUITE THE DELICATE 
SUBJECT I'VE COME HERE TO FIND THE 
ANSWER IT IS PUB IN CENTRAL 
TUNBRIDGE WELLS'S WAR OFFICE 
WORKERS COME FROM QUIET DRINK AFTER 
FINISHING WORK ON FRIDAY EVENING 
WHERE OFFICE WORKERS 
WHEN YOU'RE AT HOME IN GREECE 
HOWDY BEAT EACH OTHER 
WE USUALLY KISS EACH OTHER TWO 
TIMES TIMES WHEN YOU MEET YOUR COLLEAGUES 
OUTSIDE WORK DID THE BOUNDARIES 
DROP BE THE RULES CHANGED 
IDEYE NOT 
THINK THEY CHANGE L. THINK WE GREET EACH OTHER AS WE 
WOULD AT WORK 
IF YOU STOP WORK COLLEAGUE AND YOU 
HAD BEEN OUT FOR A DRINK WOULD YOU 
BE INCLINED TO GIVE THEM PECK ON 
THE CHEAP 
NO JUST SAY HELLO 
WE WERE TALKING WITH YOUR BOSS AND 
HE SAYS A PECK ON THE CHEEK IS O. K. 
WITH YOU FEMALE COLLEAGUES E. U.

HIM A KISS THE BY 
I AM I WANT THIS MAN NO DOUBT AS 
THE LADY CAME TO KISS ME ON THE 
CHEEK IT ENDED UP BEING A KISS ON 
THE LIPS IT IS ALL GOOD 
PSYCHOLOGIST PAM'S POOR AND EPIC OF 
EXPERT JEAN SMITH IS HERE 
HANDSHAKING STARTED CENTURIES AGO 
BECAUSE IT SHOWED THAT YOU'RE ON 
GRANT HE DID NOT HAVE THE SWORD 
TUCKED AWAY YOU PUT YOUR HAND 
FORWARD I'LL WE SHAKE HANDS WHEN I 
MEET SOMEBODY FOR THE FIRST TIME 
GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE I HOPE IS THE 
KISS THE OTHER DAY I PUT MY HAND 
FORWARD IT TO SHAKE HANDS WITH A 
COMPLETE STRANGER AND HE DID NOT 
ACKNOWLEDGE MY HAND SO I KEPT IT 
THERE AND HE EVENTUALLY DID SHAKE 
MY HAND 
HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT FIRST MEETING 
AND HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT YOU 
GET THE ANCIC WRITE 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE PHENOMENALLY 
IMPORTANT THE GREETING IS THE 
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT THE PERSON 
AT A HIGHER STATE IS USUALLY SET 
THE PACE THEY OFFER THEIR HAND OR 
THEIR CHEEK WE GET OUR CUES FROM 
THE PEOPLE WITH THE HIGHEST SOCIAL 
STATUS IF SOMEBODY IS MEETING YOU 
FOR A JOB YOU GET YOUR CUE FROM 
THEM PEOPLE OFTEN CLASH FACES ARE 
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH 
THEIR HANDS THAT IS BECAUSE THEY 
GET SO NERVOUS THEY DON'T WAIT FOR 
THAT SUPPORT Q. YOU HAVE GOT TO 
GIVE IT MOMENT 
YOU CAN BUMP NOSES BY MISTAKE 
THERE IS GROWING HABIT OF PEOPLE 
KISSING YOU THEN WE'LL HAVE NEVER 
MET BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE SUPPOSE 
IT IS WARM THING PEOPLE WHO 
YOU HAVE NEVER MET BEFORE IN YOUR 
LIFE LIFE IF I DO NOT KNOW SOMEBODY AND THEY 
COME TO KISS ME IT REALLY OFFENDS 
ME THIS IDEA OF MEETING AN OLDER 
PERSON YOU DO NOT KNOW AND SUDDENLY 
THEY GIVE YOU A KISS IT IS VERY 
STRANGE STRANGE BEING INTRODUCED TO FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS THEY ARE THE ONES TO GO 
BACK IT IT IS WHERE IF YOU'RE 
GOING TO A BUSINESS MEETING FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IT IS RARE 
I WAS BUSY AND IF YOU'RE GOING INTO 
A JOB INTERVIEW YOU SHOULD CHECK 
SOMEBODY'S HAND 
THEY KNEW MAY BE PERCEIVED AS A 
WHOLE WERE CONFIDENT WE'RE OUR OWN 
BUT WILL PSYCHOLOGISTS UNLESS YOU 
ALLOW A NURSE TO HAVE A THICK YOU 
YOU CAN ASSESS WHAT THAT PERSON IS 
GOING TO DO 
THE ON A TECHNICAL POINT WHEN 
YOU'RE AT THE KISSING STAGE IS 
THERE RULE THAT I CAN RELY ON TO 
GET ME TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF 
SOMEBODY'S FACE WITHOUT BREAKING 
THEIR NOSE 
A MAN SHOULD ALWAYS KISS A WOMAN ON 
THE RIGHT CHEEK THE TERRIBLE THING 
IS IF YOU MOVE YOUR HEAD BACK AND 
SOMEBODY IS JUST MADE WHERE TICKETS 
IN YEAR ON THE OTHER CHEEK THAT IS 
WHEN THE PROBLEMS START THAT IS 
MORE DIFFICULT AND ANNOYING 
BRAIN RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CURE 
FOR THE RIGHT CHEEK YOU FEEL THAT 
NATURAL CONNECTION IT IS WHEN 
PEOPLE ARE THINKING WHAT THE RIGHT 
HEMISPHERE OR THAT THEY OFFER THEIR 
LEFT CHEEK IF THEY'RE UP IN THE 
RIGHT CHEEK IT MEANS THERE HAVE A 
NATURAL CONNECTION 
YOU GOT A FEELING FROM SOMEBODY 
UNLESS THEIR ANTI SOCIAL PAM WE'RE OLD FRIENDS
