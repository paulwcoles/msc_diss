SCORED THEIR THIRD GOAL DANNY 
WHITAKER HIT THE BAR THREE TIMES IN

THIS AFTERNOON WELL PLAYED 
MOTHERWELL TRYING TO SECURED THIRD 
PLACE AND GET THE SPOT RANGERS

POSITION AT THE TOP OF THE S. P. L. A. TWO TWO ZERO COLCHESTER UNITED ARE STILL IN 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP TONIGHT THANKS TO 
TWO GOALS BY SCOTT VERNON THIS

AINSWORTH GOT THERE FIRST GOAL AND 
WAS ON A SUBSTITUTE HE CROSSED FOR 
DECKS FOR BLACK'S BOOK TWO APIECE

FULHAM ARE'S RUN IN THE BARCLAYS 
PREMIER LEAGUE LOOKS LIKE IT'S 
COMING TO AN END SUNDERLAND ARE 
SAVED AND WILL BE PLAYING IN THE 
TOP FLIGHT NEXT SEASON 
THREE TO ONE A DANNY COLLINS'S HEADER IN 
THE FIRST HALF HE SET THEM ON 
THEIR WAY DAVID HEALY FROM TWENTY 
YARDS STRUCK BACK AN ALL TOO 
BRIEF HIGHLIGHT AS KEN WYNNE JONES 
STEERED HOME OF THEIR THIRD THEIR 
MANAGER ADMITTED THEY HAD TO WIN 
THEIR LAST VICTORY AT CRAVEN 
COTTAGE WAS APRIL NINETEEN FIFTY TWO AND THAT 
SEASON THEY WERE RELEGATED COULD 
THE LONDONERS BE ABOUT TO SUFFER A 
FAMILIAR FATE 
IT LOOKS LIKE BOLTON MAY WELL BE 
JOINING FULHAM IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
NEXT SEASON 
I DARESAY THEY MIGHT BE RAIN FOUR TO ZERO 
THEIR FIRST WINNER IN A SIX A 
STANDING OVATION FOR ASHLEY YOUNG 
HE SCORED ONE OF THE THREE GOALS 
IN TRUTH BOLTON MADE A VERY VERY 
EASY FOR THEM SOME APPALLING 
DEFENDING IT WOULD NEED A MAMMOTH 
EFFORT FOR THEM TO STAY UP NOW 
WITHIN EIGHT POINTS FROM THE 
RELEGATION PLACES 
AN IMPRESSIVE 
PERFORMANCE FROM WIGAN TWO GOALS 
FROM BRIAN TAYLOR AT THE FIRST A 
BEAUTY COULD HAVE BEEN ADDED TO 
BUT WHY DID DAMIEN JOHNSON GET SENT 
OFF WITH THEIR HIDEOUS TACKLE THAT 
GAVE MIKE DEAN NO OPTION IT ALL 
MADE BY THE HOME WIN VERY EASY 
INDEED 
LET'S GET THE STORY OF THE INDEED MATCH AT EWOOD PARK BETWEEN 
BLACKBURN AND SPURS EIGHT GAME EIGHT GAME JUANDE RAMOS'S SIDE SHOULD HAVE WON 
IN THE FIRST SIGHT H. GAME A 
MOMENT OF BRILLIANCE DAVID BENTLEY 
CONTROLLING ANDY REID'S FORTY YARD 
PASS BRAD FRIEDEL THE STAR OF THE 
DAY WITH A STRING OF FINE SAVES 
NEAR THE END WE ALL THOUGHT DAVID 
BENTLEY SHOULD HAVE HAD A PENALTY 
WHEN HE SEEMED IMPEDED BY THE 
CHORUS 
A LATE WINNER FOR BRENTFORD CHORUS THEY HAVE WON TWO TO ONE AT MILLWALL 
SOUTHAMPTON KICKED OFF THIRD BOTTOM 
FULL TIME HERE SOUTHAMPTON ARE OUT 
OF THE DROP ZONE AFTER THIS 
FIGHTING VICTORY IT COULD BE A 
LIFE SAVER FOR THE SAINTS THERE 
CAN BE FEW COMPLAINTS FROM BRISTOL 
CITY WHO REALLY DIDN'T MATCH

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE EVERTON DERBY

TRIP TO ME THIS MIDDLESBROUGH 
FORM THE BACKBONE OF TOMORROW'S 
MATCH OF THE DAY TWO 
ACTION FROM THE PORTSMOUTH WEST 
BROM SEMI FINAL NOW 
THAT IS GOING TOWARDS MILAN BAROS 
IT IS A SAVE BY DEAN KIELY IT IS A 
GOAL IT IS KANU WHO HAS PUT 
PORTSMOUTH AHEAD 
DEAN KIELY MAKES 
A SAFE L. THINK HE CAN THEN GO AND 
GET THE SECOND ONE THEN THE 
DEFENDER GETS INVOLVED SAVE WAS WAS THAT A HANDBALL IN THE BUILD UP TO 
THE GOAL 
HE MAKES AND MOVEMENT 
DOESN'T HE 
A THAT IS THE CASE OR 
COMPLAINING FOR ALBION THAT BALL 
IS APPARENTLY STILL IN PLAY ROBERT 
KOREN HAS HIT THE BAR 
SYLVAIN DISTIN HAD TO BE ACROBATIC ISHMAEL MILLER A CHANCE 
IT WAS A VERY POOR CORNER IT 
DOESN'T MATTER PORTSMOUTH HAVE 
REACHED THE F. A. CUP FINAL FOR THE 
FIRST TIME SINCE THE SECOND WORLD 
WAR TELL ME ABOUT THE GOAL THAT 
WON THE GAME 
THE KEEPER PARRIED IT 
AND IT WAS A GOALMOUTH SCRAMBLE L. 
HAD TO SCORE 
WHAT A GREAT DAY FOR 
PORTSMOUTH 
FANTASTIC TO BE GOING PORTSMOUTH TO A FINAL FULL CREDIT TO WEST 
BROM THEY WERE EXCELLENT THEY 
MADE A REAL GAME OF IT BUT A GREAT 
DAY FOR THE CLUB 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
FOR YOU PERSONALLY 
IT IS GREAT IT 
IS GOOD FOR MY FAMILY GREAT FOR 
THE SUPPORTERS 
THERE WAS A BIG 
SUGGESTION THERE WAS A HANDBALL 
LEADING UP TO THE GOAL 
I'M NOT 
SURE ABOUT THAT L. HAVEN'T SEEN THE 
REPLAY YET SO I CANNOT BE SURE YOU 
PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW IS IT 
DOESN'T MATTER THE REFEREE LET US 
PLAY AND WE FINISHED IT OFF WE ARE 
IN THE FINAL THAT IS WHAT WE 
WANTED 
IT IS ALWAYS HORRIBLE TO WANTED HAVE TO DO THIS INTERVIEW THAT 
MUST FEEL TERRIBLE 
NO IT IS O. K. 
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE CAME OUT 
OF THIS GAME WITH A BIT OF 
CONFIDENCE AND BELIEF WE HAVE SIX 
VERY IMPORTANT LEAGUE FIXTURES TO 
PLAY THE TEAM SHOWED ENOUGH TODAY 
THAT WE ARE A DECENT ENOUGH 
FOOTBALL TEAM OUR TEAM HAVE SCORED 
NINETY NINE GOALS IN ALL COMPETITIONS THE 
FRUSTRATION IS THAT WE DID NOT 
THREATEN THEIR GOAL HOPEFULLY WE 
WILL COME OUT OF TODAY AND TRIED TO 
APPLY OUR TRADE WEEK IN WEEK OUT 
WAS THE BUILD UP TO THE GOAL HANDBALL 
I THINK MILAN BAROS HAS HANDBALL SAID IT ALL WE HAVE SEEN THE 
REPLAY AND I THINK IT IS CLEARLY A 
HANDBALL YOU CAN'T BLAME THE 
REFEREE BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS HANDBALL 
A SIGNIFICANT DAY 
IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE ARSENAL OR 
OUT OF IT 
WHEN YOU CAN'T BLAME THE 
REFEREE WHO CAN YOU BLAME FULHAM 
AND DERBY ARE GONE IT IS NOW 
BETWEEN READING PEOPLE PEOPLE 
BOLTON AND BIRMINGHAM 
CHELSEA ARE 
STILL IN IT 
CARLO CUDICINI KEPT 
THEM IN THE GAME THEY ROLL ON A A QUICK REMINDER FOR NEWS ON ALL OF 
TODAY'S THAT BALL THE B. B. C. SPORT 
WEBSITE IS CONSTANTLY BEING UPDATED
