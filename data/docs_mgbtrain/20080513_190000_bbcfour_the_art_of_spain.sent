OH THIS YEAR I'M OFF TO SUNNY SPAIN 
TOO OFTEN WE THINK OF SPAIN AS TWO WEEKS ON THE BEACH 
Y. VIVA ESPANA 
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SPAIN 
SPAIN HAS PRODUCED SOME OF THE MOST STARTLING AND ORIGINAL ART EVER CREATED 
ART THAT HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY OVERSHADOWED BY THE REST OF EUROPE 
ART THAT WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT 
BUT SPANISH ART IS THE ART THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT 
BECAUSE IT HOLDS THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING ALL OF EUROPE AND ITS CULTURE 
IT WAS IN SPAIN AND ITS EMPIRE THAT SO MANY OF EUROPE'S GREAT BATTLES WERE PLAYED OUT 
CHRISTIANITY VERSUS ISLAM 
CATHOLIC VERSUS PROTESTANT 
FASCIST VERSUS SOCIALIST 
TRAVEL THIS COUNTRY OF EXTREMES 
EXPLORING ITS TURBULENT PAST AND DISCOVERING ITS EXTRAORDINARY ART 
I'M STARTING IN THE SOUTH 
FOR MANY VISITORS THIS IS SPAIN 
BUT AWAY FROM THE BEACHES THERE ARE MAGNIFICENT SIGHTS 
GRAND PALACES 
CASTLES 
AND MOSQUES 
REMINDERS OF A DIFFERENT CULTURE FROM A DISTANT TIME 
A TIME WHEN SPAIN WAS CALLED AL ANDALUS 
WHAT'S OFTEN FORGOTTEN IS THAT FOR OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS 
MUCH OF SPAIN WAS RULED BY MUSLIMS AND THE SOUTH WAS ITS BEATING HEART 
SOUTHERN SPAIN WAS A UNIQUE FRONTIER WHERE EAST MET WEST WITH EXPLOSIVE RESULTS 
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW ISLAMIC SPAIN BECAME ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE CIVILISATIONS EVER SEEN 
ONE THAT'S SHAPED SPAIN AND THE REST OF EUROPE EVER SINCE 
RIGHT AT THE TIP OF SOUTHERN SPAIN A HUGE ROCK EXPLODES OUT OF THE MEDITERRANEAN 
BUT THE ROCK ISN'T SPANISH 
IT'S BRITISH 
AND LONG BEFORE BRITAIN OWNED IT 
THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR BELONGED TO ANOTHER FOREIGN POWER 
A POWER THAT RULED IT FOR NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS 
ON THIRTIETH APRIL IN THE YEAR SEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN 
AN ARAB GENERAL NAMED TARIQ IBN ZIYAD 
SAILED ACROSS THESE WATERS FROM NORTH AFRICA 
WITH AN ARMY OF FIVE THOUSAND ARAB AND NORTH AFRICAN SOLDIERS 
AND INVADED GIBRALTAR 
HE GAVE THE ROCK ITS NAME JABAL AL TARIQ TARIQ'S MOUNTAIN 
HE USED IT AS THE LAUNCH PAD FOR THE ISLAMIC CONQUEST OF CHRISTIAN SPAIN 
JUST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TROOPS MARCHED ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
BUILDING FORTIFICATIONS AS THEY WENT 
AFTER JUST THREE YEARS THE INVASION WAS COMPLETE 
ONLY THE FAR FLUNG PROVINCES OF THE EXTREME NORTH RESISTED 
PROTECTED BY IMPASSABLE MOUNTAINS 
BUT THE REST OF SPAIN WAS NOW 
PART OF A VAST ISLAMIC EMPIRE WHICH REACHED AS FAR AS INDIA 
EVEN ITS NAME WAS CHANGED FROM SPAIN TO AL ANDALUS 
AND ITS NEW RULERS WERE AN ASSORTMENT OF ARABS NORTH AFRICANS 
EGYPTIANS AND SYRIANS 
THE MOORS 
NOW SPAIN WAS PRETTY MUCH USED TO BEING CONQUERED BY FOREIGN INVADERS OVER THE CENTURIES 
THE ROMANS THE CELTS AND THE VISIGOTHS HAD ALL HAD A GO AT RULING THIS VAST LAND 
AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS THE PRIMITIVE PEOPLES OF SPAIN HAD BEEN A BIT OF A SOFT TOUCH 
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN FOR THINKING 
THE COLLISION BETWEEN MUSLIM INVADERS AND A CHRISTIAN PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE HAD SOME FAIRLY EXPLOSIVE RESULTS 
AND THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION BUT NOT OF THE KIND YOU MIGHT EXPECT 
IT WAS AN EXPLOSION OF ART AND CULTURE 
THE STORY OF THIS ART AND CULTURE REMAINS SHOCKINGLY NEGLECTED 
BUT I THINK IT'S THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING 
THE WHOLE OF SPANISH ART 
AND ITS UNIQUE INTENSITY 
THE FIRST GREAT FLOWERING OF MOORISH CULTURE 
TOOK PLACE IN THE NEW CAPITAL CITY OF CORDOBA 
BY THE LATE EIGHTH CENTURY THE MOORS HAD TURNED CORDOBA 
INTO THE BRIGHTEST WEALTHIEST AND BUSIEST CITY IN EUROPE 
ITS FAME REACHED AS FAR AS A QUIET CLOISTER IN SAXONY 
WHERE A CHRISTIAN NUN DESCRIBED THE CITY 
AS THE BRILLIANT ORNAMENT OF THE WORLD 
THIS GLITTERING CITY WAS ALL THE WORK OF ONE YOUNG MAN 
HIS NAME WAS ABD AL RAHMAN AND HE WAS AN EXILE 
HIS FAMILY HAD RULED DAMASCUS IN SYRIA 
BUT IN THE YEAR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THEY WERE ALL KILLED IN A BRUTAL CIVIL WAR 
ABD AL RAHMAN WAS THE SOLE SURVIVOR OF THE MASSACRE 
AND HE FLED ALL THE WAY FROM SYRIA TO CORDOBA 
WHERE HE QUICKLY ESTABLISHED HIMSELF 
AS THE CALIPH OR RULER OF AL ANDALUS 
HIS PASSAGE THROUGH LIFE HAD HARDLY BEEN EASY 
BUT HE WAS TO TURN OUT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FIGURES IN WORLD HISTORY 
HE DID SO BY ATTEMPTING TO RECREATE THE SPLENDOURS OF HIS NATIVE DAMASCUS HERE IN CORDOBA 
HE WANTED TO TURN THIS PLACE INTO A KIND OF PARADISE ON EARTH 
UNDER ABD AL RAHMAN A GREAT CIVILISATION WOULD BE BORN HERE ON SPANISH SOIL 
HASHIM 
I'M HERE REALLY TO TRY AND FIND OUT ABOUT CORDOBA AS IT WAS IN THE GOLDEN AGE 
THERE WERE MANY MANY PHILOSOPHERS AND ARTISTS 
THAT WAS COMING TO CORDOBA FOR LEARNING 
MODERN SCIENCE HAVE MANY ROOTS IN THIS TIME IN CORDOBA 
IN ASTRONOMY AND PHILOSOPHY IN PHYSIC IN ALL THE KNOWLEDGE 
CAN BE LIKE A REVOLUTION YOU KNOW LIKE A CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
SO IF SOMEBODY SAY AROUND NINE HUNDRED CAME FROM PARIS OR LONDON 
AND ARRIVED IN CORDOBA 
WHAT IMPRESSION DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE MADE ON THEM 
IT'S LIKE WHEN IF NOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING 
IN THE POOR COUNTRIES GO TO NEW YORK NOW OR PARIS OR LONDON 
OR MADRID I THINK THIS CAN BE THE SAME IMPRESSION 
AT THE HEART OF ABD AL RAHMAN'S PARADISE ON EARTH 
WAS THE GREAT MOSQUE OF CORDOBA 
WHEN WORK BEGAN HERE IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY 
ISLAM WAS ONLY A CENTURY OLD 
WHICH MAKES THIS ONE OF THE FIRST MOSQUES EVER BUILT 
THE GREAT MOSQUE IS A FOREST OF STONE COLUMNS 
WHICH SEEM TO GO ON FOREVER AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE 
THE EFFECT IS A BIT LIKE BEING IN A HALL OF MIRRORS 
YOU ACTUALLY FEEL LOST IN HERE TRULY DISORIENTATED 
AND THAT'S THE POINT 
THE WORSHIPPER FEELS IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND INFINITE 
PERHAPS GOD HIMSELF 
IN ISLAM THE DIRECT REPRESENTATION OF GOD 
OR ANY LIVING BEING IS FORBIDDEN 
THE DESIGNERS COULDN'T USE PICTURES OR STATUES TO INSPIRE RELIGIOUS AWE 
JUST THE FORMS OF ARCHITECTURE ITSELF 
AND THE DESIGN OF THE MOSQUE IS UNIFORM THROUGHOUT 
SO WHEREVER YOU STAND 
IN THIS AMAZING NEVER ENDING FOREST OF STONE 
YOU FEEL THE SAME CONNECTION TO GOD 
EARLY ISLAM WAS A RELIGION WITHOUT HIERARCHY 
WITHOUT CLERGY AND LITURGY 
YOU JUST ENTERED THE SPACE AND PRAYED 
SO IT WAS VITAL FOR THE ARCHITECTS TO CREATE A BUILDING 
IN WHICH EVERYONE FELT EQUAL 
THIS IS SPIRITUALLY DEMOCRATIC ARCHITECTURE 
I FOUND THE EXPERIENCE OF VISITING THE GREAT MOSQUE REALLY POWERFUL 
I THINK IT'S ALL THE MORE MOVING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE MAN WHO CREATED IT ABD AL RAHMAN 
NOW WE DON'T KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HIM BUT WE DO KNOW THAT HE LEFT US ONE POEM 
IT'S A POEM ABOUT A PALM TREE THAT HE FOUND 
THAT HAD SEEDED ITSELF SOMEWHERE OUT ON THE PLAINS OF AL ANDALUS 
HE SAW IT AS A SYMBOL OF HIMSELF 
HE WROTE AN ODE TO IT THE PALM HE SAID WAS LIKE ME IT'S AN EXILE 
IT REMINDED HIM OF HIS FAMILY IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT SYMBOL TO ANY ARAB LIVING IN SPAIN 
IT SYMBOLISED WATER SHELTER NOURISHMENT 
NOW OF COURSE THAT PALM TREE HAS GONE FOREVER BUT I WONDER IF THIS MOSQUE 
WITH ITS ENDLESSLY REPEATED COLUMNS 
ISN'T A THOUSAND PALM TREES PLANTED HERE 
PRESERVED FOREVER IN STONE 
BUT SLAP BANG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PRAYER HALL 
IS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY UN ISLAMIC 
IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY LONG AFTER THE FALL OF THE MOORS CORDOBA'S CHRISTIAN RULERS 
DEMOLISHED THE CENTRAL COLUMNS OF THE MOSQUE 
AND ERECTED THIS VAST TEMPLE TO CHRISTIANITY 
A CATHEDRAL PLANTED IN THE CENTRE OF A MOSQUE 
IT'S LIKE A GREAT PARASITE IN ITS BELLY 
EVEN THE GREAT CATHOLIC EMPEROR CHARLES V. WHO AUTHORISED THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CATHEDRAL 
REALISED HE'D MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE WHEN IT WAS COMPLETE HE ROUNDED ON THE ARCHITECTS 
SAYING YOU'VE TAKEN SOMETHING UNIQUE AND TURNED IT INTO SOMETHING MUNDANE 
NOW I THINK YOU CAN STILL APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF THE MOSQUE 
BUT AS AN ACT OF CULTURAL VANDALISM I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT 
IT'S LIKE A SORT OF DAGGER PLUNGED INTO THE HEART OF THE MOSQUE 
IT REPRESENTS A REALLY HEAVY HANDED IMPOSITION 
OF ONE SET OF RELIGIOUS VALUES ON ANOTHER 
AND THERE'S SOMETHING QUITE UGLY ABOUT THAT 
SO MUCH OF THE LATER STORY OF SPAIN WOULD BE DOMINATED BY RELIGIOUS CONFLICT 
BUT DURING THE GOLDEN AGE OF AL ANDALUS 
BACK IN ITS NINTH AND TENTH CENTURY HEYDAY 
THE RELIGIOUS REALITIES WERE QUITE DIFFERENT 
THE EXTRAORDINARY FACT IS THAT HERE IN AL ANDALUS 
UNIQUELY THE THREE RELIGIONS LIVED TOGETHER IN RELATIVE HARMONY 
NOW ISLAM REGARDED JEWS AND CHRISTIANS AS PEOPLE OF THE BOOK 
WHOSE HOLY WRITINGS WERE TO BE RESPECTED 
AS FORERUNNERS OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMED'S FINAL REVELATION 
SO THE CONQUERING MOORS MADE NO EFFORT 
TO CONVINCE THE CHRISTIANS AND THE JEWS TO CONVERT 
AND THEY EVEN AS THE KORAN COMMANDED GAVE THEM FREEDOM OF WORSHIP 
FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS THE THREE RELIGIONS RUBBED ALONG SURPRISINGLY WELL 
FRIENDSHIPS AND MARRIAGES FLOURISHED ACROSS THE FAITHS 
MANY CHRISTIANS AND JEWS HELD PROMINENT POSITIONS IN THE ISLAMIC STATE 
ANTONIO MANUEL HOW FULLY INTEGRATED REALLY 
WERE THESE THREE DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN CORDOBA 
THE JEWS THE CHRISTIANS THE MUSLIMS 
SO WAS THIS SOCIETY A KIND OF PARADISE ON EARTH 
IN THE HEART OF THE OLD TOWN OF CORDOBA 
STANDS AN EXTRAORDINARY TESTAMENT 
TO THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE THREE RELIGIONS 
DURING THE GOLDEN AGE OF AL ANDALUS 
AT FIRST SIGHT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SPACE SEEMS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT ISLAMIC 
LOOK AT THAT FANTASTIC ELABORATE ARCH 
LOOK AT THOSE BEAUTIFUL SHAPES LIKE FLAMES CUT FROM STONE 
BUT EVERYTHING HERE ISN'T QUITE AS IT SEEMS 
BECAUSE THAT WRITING 
IT'S NOT ARABIC IT'S HEBREW 
THIS ISN'T A MOSQUE 
IT'S A SYNAGOGUE 
THE JEWISH POPULATION OF AL ANDALUS FARED PARTICULARLY WELL UNDER ARAB RULE 
UNDER THE CHRISTIANS IN THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH CENTURIES THEY'D BEEN PERSECUTED 
UNDER ISLAM THEY PROSPERED 
BECOMING SUCCESSFUL MERCHANTS 
REACHING THE HIGHEST POSITIONS IN GOVERNMENT 
NOWADAYS WE TEND TO THINK OF THESE TWO GREAT RELIGIONS 
JUDAISM AND ISLAM AS NATURALLY OPPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER 
BUT THIS SPACE IS A REMINDER THAT IT WASN'T ALWAYS SO 
THAT HERE IN CORDOBA ONCE UPON A TIME 
JEWS AND MUSLIMS LIVED NOT AS ENEMIES BUT AS BROTHERS 
SO I THINK THIS SMALL UNASSUMING SPACE 
ACTUALLY CONTAINS RATHER A LARGE LESSON FOR THE MODERN WORLD 
THE CHRISTIANS OF AL ANDALUS WERE JUST AS KEEN TO EMBRACE ARAB CULTURE 
MANY EVEN CONVERTED TO ISLAM 
AFTER THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF ISLAMIC OCCUPATION 
SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE POPULATION HAD BECOME MUSLIM 
BUT EVEN THOSE WHO DIDN'T CONVERT WERE PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED BY THE ARAB WAY OF LIFE 
THEY WERE KNOWN MOZARABS MEANING ARABISED 
AND THEY ADOPTED THE DRESS LANGUAGE AND CUSTOMS OF THEIR RULERS 
IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING THAT THE PEOPLES OF MEDIEVAL SPAIN 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO SEDUCED BY ARAB CIVILISATION 
AFTER ALL THIS WAS A CULTURAL DESERT 
THEY WERE LEADING DOUR SIMPLE LIVES AND SUDDENLY ALONG COMES 
THIS VIBRANT COLOURFUL SOPHISTICATED BUT ABOVE ALL SENSUAL CULTURE 
AND FOR ME ALMOST ITS GREATEST SYMBOL 
IS THE BEAUTIFUL ARAB BATH HOUSE A KIND OF TEMPLE OF SENSUAL DELIGHT 
AS WELL AS LUXURIATING IN THE BATH HOUSE 
THE MOORS INTRODUCED NEW FASHIONS HAIRSTYLES AND PERFUMES 
THEY ALSO BROUGHT TOOTHPASTE AND UNDERARM DEODORANT TO THE WEST FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE MOORS TREATED EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE AS IF IT WERE A WORK OF ART 
WHETHER IT WAS CLOTHES OR COSMETICS OR FOOD 
THE MOORS ALSO INTRODUCED TO SPAIN A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF CULINARY DELIGHTS 
THEY BROUGHT IN THE IDEA OF EATING IN COURSES 
AND THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM A WHOLE NEW RANGE OF INGREDIENTS 
THAT TRANSFORMED WESTERN EUROPEAN COOKERY 
RICE COFFEE SUGAR CITRUS FRUITS CORIANDER BASIL 
AND THEY TURNED COOKING INTO AN ART FORM 
FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS DON PEPE HAS RUN A RESTAURANT IN CORDOBA 
THAT SPECIALISES IN MOORISH CUISINE 
MUY BUENO 
WHAT ARE WE EATING IS THIS A TYPICAL MOORISH INFLUENCED DISH 
WHY DO YOU THINK FOOD WAS SO IMPORTANT TO THE MOORS 
AND IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE JUST ONE THING 
THAT THE MOORS DID FOR WORLD COOKING WHAT WOULD IT BE 
BUT FOR THE MOORS FOOD WASN'T THE ONLY PART OF THE DINING EXPERIENCE 
SURPRISINGLY THEY ALSO ENJOYED A DRINK 
THE KORAN FORBIDS THE CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL 
BUT WE KNOW THAT IT WAS PRODUCED IN LARGE QUANTITIES THROUGHOUT ISLAMIC SPAIN 
ALCOHOL ITSELF IS AN ARABIC WORD 
NOW THEY USED IT IN COSMETICS AND IN MEDICINE BUT THEY ALSO DRANK IT 
AND THEY EVEN INTRODUCED A DISTILLATION PROCESS 
THAT WOULD RESULT IN THAT MOST SPANISH OF DRINKS SHERRY 
COMO ES USTED HOW ARE YOU 
YOU'RE THE MAN WITH THE SECRET WAY OF GETTING THE SHERRY FROM THE CASKS O. K. 
I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT 
IN THERE O. K. 
ONE TWO 
O. K. CAN I HAVE A GO YES 
O. K. 
SO I JUST SORT OF SWING IT ONE TWO ONE TWO 
YEAH IT'S EASY TO GET IT ALL OVER THE FLOOR VERY GOOD OH THAT'S GOOD 
I'D SAY THAT'S ABOUT TWO OUT OF TEN 
BUT AS WELL AS INDULGING THE SENSES THE MOORS WERE ALSO INTENT 
READING WAS SO VALUED THAT THEY TURNED SCRIPT ITSELF INTO A COILING ORNATE FORM OF ART 
THE KORAN ENCOURAGED LEARNING SAYING THAT IT BROUGHT YOU CLOSER TO GOD 
AND THE MOORS TOOK THIS DECREE TO HEART 
CORDOBA WAS FULL OF LIBRARIES ONE OF WHICH WAS REPUTED TO CONTAIN OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BOOKS 
TEN TIMES MORE THAN THE CONTENTS OF THE LIBRARIES OF THE REST OF EUROPE PUT TOGETHER 
THE MOORS MADE GREAT ADVANCES IN PHILOSOPHY LITERATURE SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS 
THE ARAB CONTRIBUTION TO WESTERN THOUGHT WAS TRULY ENORMOUS 
AMONG OTHER THINGS IT WAS THROUGH AL ANDALUS 
THAT THE WEST RE DISCOVERED VIRTUALLY ALL OF ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHY 
THROUGH AL ANDALUS THAT WE GOT THE HINDU ARABIC NUMBER SYSTEM OUR NUMBER SYSTEM 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOGICAL THOUGHT HOW WE COUNT AND CALCULATE 
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE FOUNDATIONS FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS WERE LAID 
IN THE GREAT CENTRES OF SPANISH ISLAMIC LEARNING LIKE CORDOBA 
AS YOU DRIVE ROUND THE LANDSCAPE OF SOUTHERN SPAIN IT'S FULL OF A SENSE OF THE MOORISH PAST 
THERE ARE THESE LITTLE CASTLES EVERYWHERE 
SURROUNDED BY TINY LITTLE WHITE VILLAGES 
BUT I THINK IT WAS THE LANDSCAPE THAT THEY ALTERED MOST OF ALL BECAUSE WHEREAS FOR THE ROMANS 
SPAIN HAD JUST BEEN THE ARSE END OF EMPIRE A DRY AND BARREN PLACE 
TO THESE PEOPLE FROM THE DESERT THIS WAS A LAND FULL OF AGRICULTURAL POSSIBILITY 
AND THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM A WHOLE RANGE OF TECHNIQUES FOR FARMING DRY LAND 
SYSTEMS OF IRRIGATION CANALS THEY PLANTED OUT OLIVES AND VINEYARDS 
AND AS A RESULT THERE WAS A HUGE POPULATION EXPLOSION 
SUDDENLY PEOPLE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TO EAT THEY HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH WATER TO DRINK 
SPAIN REALLY HAD NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD 
AND IN THE COUNTRYSIDE OUTSIDE CORDOBA THE GREATEST SYMBOL 
OF ISLAMIC POWER AND INFLUENCE IN SPAIN ROSE OUT OF THE GROUND 
THESE RUINS ARE ALL THAT'S LEFT OF THE MOST SPLENDID PALACE EVER BUILT BY THE MOORS 
MADINAT AL ZAHRA 
IT WAS BUILT IN THE TENTH CENTURY TO CELEBRATE 
THE MIGHT OF ABD AL RAHMAN THE THIRD DESCENDANT OF THE GREAT EXILE 
WHO'D FOUNDED THE GOLDEN AGE 
IN THE YEAR NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE AL RAHMAN PROCLAIMED HIMSELF 
NOT ONLY CALIPH OF AL ANDALUS BUT RULER OF THE ENTIRE ISLAMIC EMPIRE 
AND TO CELEBRATE THIS AUDACIOUS ACT OF SELF PROMOTION 
HE BUILT THIS VAST PALACE COMPLEX THE SIZE OF A CITY 
IT WAS TO BECOME THE VERSAILLES OF SPAIN THE EPITOME OF THE ISLAMIC PALACE 
WOW IT IS FANTASTICALLY IMPRESSIVE BUT JUST THINK HOW MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE IT MUST HAVE BEEN 
WHEN THIS PLACE WAS IN ITS HEYDAY AND GOLD AND SILVER AND MAGNIFICENT TEXTILES DECORATED EVERY SURFACE 
APPARENTLY ONE ROOM EVEN CONTAINED A VAST SUSPENDED VAT FULL OF MERCURY 
AND AT THE CALIPH'S COMMAND A SERVANT WOULD BANG IT 
AND THE MERCURY WOULD RIPPLE 
AND LIGHT WOULD DANCE AND SPARKLE ON EVERY SURFACE 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A BIT LIKE SOME MEDIEVAL ISLAMIC GLITTER BALL 
AND THE GUESTS WOULD REEL BACKWARDS IN AWE AND TERROR 
BUT THIS CITY WAS ALSO MEANT TO TOUCH THE SOUL 
DICTATED IN THE DESERT 
PARADISE IS DESCRIBED AS A GARDEN FLOWING WITH STREAMS 
AND MADINAT AL ZAHRA WAS BUILT AROUND GARDENS AND WATER 
THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A PARADISE ON EARTH 
A TANTALISING GLIMPSE OF THE ETERNAL GARDEN THAT AWAITS THE RIGHTEOUS 
THESE ARCHES ARE THE SAME AS IN CORDOBA'S MOSQUE 
EVEN THE COLOURS ARE THE SAME RED AND WHITE 
THE COLOURS OF THE AL RAHMAN DYNASTY 
BUT HERE POWER POLITICS ARE BLENDED WITH SPIRITUALITY 
AND RUNNING THROUGH IT ALL IS THE IDEA OF PARADISE 
THIS IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE OF ALL OF THE ROOMS IN MADINAT AL ZAHRA 
IT'S THE NERVE CENTRE OF THE ENTIRE COMPLEX THE THRONE ROOM OF CALIPH ABD AL RAHMAN THE THIRD 
AND HERE IT'S AS IF THE IDEA OF PARADISE HAS BEEN SET IN STONE 
IT'S BEEN ALLOWED TO TAKE OVER THE ARCHITECTURE 
LOOK AT THAT GREAT WALL OF ORNAMENTAL CARVING 
IT'S AS IF STONE ITSELF HAS BEEN MADE TO GO AGAINST ITS OWN NATURE 
AND BEEN TURNED INTO A KIND OF PLANT LIFE THESE TENDRILS AND SHOOTS THAT GROW UP THE WALL 
YOU REALLY DO FEEL THAT YOU ARE IN A KIND OF PARADISE 
PLANT MOTIFS AREN'T THE ONLY DECORATION IN THIS ROOM 
THE WALLS ARE ALSO COVERED IN PATTERNS MADE FROM GEOMETRY 
AND ARAB WRITING BOTH LOADED WITH RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE 
IN A WORLD IN WHICH THE DEPICTION OF REAL FIGURES 
REAL LIFE WAS FORBIDDEN 
THE MUSLIM ARTIST HAD TO TURN TO PATTERN AND ELEVATE IT TO AN ART FORM 
AND THESE STUNNINGLY INTRICATE FORESTS OF DECORATION ARE THE PINNACLE OF EARLY ISLAMIC ART 
NOTHING LIKE THEM SURVIVES ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD 
THEY'RE THE ISLAMIC EQUIVALENT OF THE GREATEST CHRISTIAN FRESCOES BUT WITHOUT A HUMAN FIGURE IN SIGHT 
WHAT YOU REALLY NOTICE ABOUT THIS SPACE IS THE WAY IN WHICH EVERY SQUARE INCH HAS BEEN DECORATED 
NOW THAT'S UNIQUE AND IT WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF SPANISH ISLAMIC ART 
IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY DEVELOPED A TERROR OF EMPTY SPACE 
BUT THE GLORY OF MADINAT AL ZAHRA WAS TO BE SHORT LIVED 
LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER WORK ON THE PALACE BEGAN 
IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY CIVIL WAR ENGULFED AL ANDALUS 
THE DYNASTY OF ABD AL RAHMAN RULERS FOR NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS WAS OVERTHROWN 
MADINAT AL ZAHRA WAS SACKED AND LOOTED 
THE GOLDEN AGE WAS OVER 
SO WHY DID THIS GOLDEN MOMENT COME TO AN END 
WELL SOME BLAME FIERCE POLITICAL RIVALRY BETWEEN 
THE VARIOUS ISLAMIC TRIBES THAT MADE UP MUSLIM SPAIN FROM THE START 
OTHERS SAY IT WAS DUE TO CORRUPTION WITHIN THE CALIPHATE ITSELF 
BUT MY OWN FAVOURITE EXPLANATION WAS GIVEN BY THE GREATEST SPANISH ARAB HISTORIAN OF THE TIME 
IT'S WONDERFUL IT'S THE ORANGE GROVE THEORY OF HISTORY 
HE SAID THAT ANY SOCIETY IS DOOMED ONCE IT'S BECOMES WEALTHY ENOUGH 
AND THEREFORE SEDENTARY ENOUGH TO PLANT ORANGE TREES 
MAYBE IN THE END THEY WERE JUST UNDONE BY THEIR OWN SUCCESS 
IN ONE THOUSAND THIRTY ONE AL ANDALUS SPLIT INTO DOZENS OF SELF GOVERNING CITY STATES 
FIGHTING AMONGST EACH OTHER FOR TERRITORY AND POWER 
BUT THINGS WERE TO GET FAR WORSE 
I'VE COME TO THE CITY OF SEVILLE TWO HOURS' DRIVE TO THE WEST OF CORDOBA 
IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY THIS BECAME THE MOST IMPORTANT CITY IN SPAIN 
HOME TO A NEW SET OF ARAB RULERS 
FOR THE BEST PART OF TWO HUNDRED YEARS AL ANDALUS WAS TO BE RULED 
BY A MUCH MORE HARDLINE FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC REGIME 
TWO SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS OF MUSLIMS FROM NORTH AFRICA WHO INVADED AND TOOK CONTROL 
NOT ONLY WERE THEY MUCH MORE OPPRESSIVE TO CHRISTIANS AND JEWS IN AL ANDALUS 
BUT THEY ALSO EMBARKED ON REGULAR JIHADS INTO THE CHRISTIAN NORTH 
THE AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR OF THE NEW REGIME WOULD SOON PROVOKE A MIGHTY CONFRONTATION 
WHICH WOULD EXPLODE ONTO THE STREETS OF SEVILLE AND ENGULF THE WHOLE OF AL ANDALUS 
THE STONES OF THIS GREAT BUILDING HAVE THEIR OWN VIVID STORY TO TELL 
ABOUT THE EPIC STRUGGLE THAT TOOK PLACE IN SEVILLE 
THIS WAS ORIGINALLY A MINARET 
PART OF THE GREAT MOSQUE THAT STOOD IN THE HEART OF THE CITY 
FROM ITS SUMMIT THE MUSLIM FAITHFUL WERE CALLED TO PRAYER 
NOW IT'S TOPPED BY A RENAISSANCE BELL TOWER PEALING OUT THE MESSAGE THAT IT'S TIME FOR MASS 
THE TOWER'S A GREAT SYMBOL OF THE BATTLE THAT WAS TO CONVULSE SPAIN 
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS REACHING SEVILLE IN THE MID THIRTEENTH CENTURY 
IT WAS FROM HERE IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THAT THE MOORS WATCHED AS 
A NEW ENEMY LAID SIEGE TO SEVILLE AN ENEMY THAT THREATENED THE SPANISH MUSLIMS' POWER AND THEIR RELIGION 
ONE SO FEARED THAT THE MOORS WANTED TO DESTROY THIS BEAUTIFUL MINARET 
RATHER THAN LET IT FALL INTO THEIR ENEMY'S HANDS 
THE ENEMY AT THE CITY GATES WAS THE CHRISTIANS AND THEY WERE ON THE WARPATH 
FOR THREE HUNDRED YEARS THE INDEPENDENT CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS OF THE NORTH 
HAD EXISTED IN AN UNEASY TRUCE WITH THE MOORS OF AL ANDALUS 
BUT THE CHRISTIANS WERE GETTING HUNGRY FOR POWER AND TERRITORY 
PROVOKED BY THE RISE OF ISLAMIC MILITANCY THEY DECIDED TO CRUSADE AGAINST THE INFIDEL 
AND SO THE RECONQUEST BEGAN A CRUSADE THAT WAS TO LAST MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
A MONUMENTALLY LONG AND BLOODY CAMPAIGN 
THIS CONFLICT WOULD ESTABLISH A PECULIARLY FERVENT FORM OF CATHOLICISM 
AS THE SPANISH NATIONAL RELIGION 
IT WAS ALSO THE CONFLICT FROM WHICH MODERN SPAIN WOULD EMERGE 
DURING THE TWELFTH CENTURY THE CHRISTIANS 
PAINFULLY EDGED INTO AL ANDALUS AND ONE BY ONE THE ISLAMIC CITIES FELL 
THEN SEVILLE ITSELF WAS CAPTURED IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT AFTER TWO YEARS' SIEGE 
THE CHRISTIAN CONQUERORS OF MEDIEVAL SEVILLE PROCLAIMED 
LET US CREATE SUCH A BUILDING THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL TAKE US FOR LUNATICS SOME STATEMENT OF INTENT 
SO THEY DEMOLISHED THE GREAT MOSQUE AND THEY PUT UP IN ITS PLACE 
TELLS ME IS STILL THE SINGLE LARGEST CHRISTIAN CATHEDRAL IN THE WORLD 
A GREAT CRUSHING SYMBOL OF THE TRIUMPH OF MILITANT CHRISTIANITY 
THE CATHEDRAL'S BUILT IN A NORTH EUROPEAN STYLE 
GOTHIC IN DESIGN COMPLETE WITH HIGH VAULTING CEILING 
FLYING BUTTRESSES AND CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS EVERYWHERE 
THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST PLACE YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND TRACES OF ISLAMIC DESIGN 
BUT IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY ENOUGH IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT OLD HABITS DIE HARD 
WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT THE GOTHIC STYLE AS DONE BY THE SPANISH 
ESPECIALLY THE SPANISH IN THE SOUTH 
IS THIS INCREDIBLE SENSE OF OVER DECORATION 
LOOK AT THIS ALTARPIECE 
IT'S ALMOST AS IF EVERY INCH OF SPACE HAS TO BE DECORATED 
IT MAKES ME THINK OF 
THE MOORISH TERROR OF EMPTY SPACE 
THAT ABSOLUTE COVERING OF EVERY INCH 
LOOK AT THIS THROUGH HALF CLOSED EYES AND YOU MIGHT ALMOST BE IN SOME MOORISH PALACE 
I WONDER WHETHER THE EXPERIENCE OF SPANISH CHRISTIANS ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH 
WASN'T SO PERMEATED BY A SENSE OF MOORISH PATTERN AND DESIGN 
THAT THIS WORKED ITSELF INTO THE VERY SOUL OF SPANISH ART 
SO THAT ALTHOUGH THIS GREAT ALTARPIECE REPRESENTS 
THE GRAND TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY OVER THE FORCES OF ISLAM 
AT THE SAME TIME IT COMPLETELY EXPRESSES A KIND OF MOORISH AESTHETIC 
ELSE IN THE WORLD 
THE CATHEDRAL ISN'T THE ONLY BUILDING IN SEVILLE TO BEAR THE IMPRINT OF THE MOORS' 
THIS IS THE ALCAZAR A PALACE FIT FOR A MOORISH KING 
BUT THIS BUILDING WASN'T MEANT FOR MUSLIMS 
INSTEAD IT WAS BUILT FOR ONE OF SEVILLE'S NEW CHRISTIAN KINGS IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR 
SO WHAT KIND OF SELF RESPECTING CHRISTIAN MONARCH 
WOULD BUILD HIMSELF A PALACE THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS 
WELL HIS NAME WAS PEDRO THE CRUEL AND BOY DID YOU HAVE TO BE CRUEL 
IN THE BLOODY WORLD OF MEDIEVAL SPAIN TO EARN YOURSELF A STAND ALONE NICKNAME LIKE THAT 
AMONG OTHER THINGS PEDRO WAS A RAPIST AND A MASS MURDERER 
HE MURDERED HIS OWN BROTHER IN THIS ROOM AND HE ALSO MURDERED A VISITING ARAB DIGNITARY WHO 
WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO COME HERE WITH THE LARGEST RUBY IN THE KNOWN WORLD 
HAVING NICKED IT FROM THE CORPSE PEDRO THEN GAVE IT TO EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE 
AND IT'S NOW PART OF THE BRITISH CROWN JEWELS 
I LIKE THE THOUGHT THAT EVERY TIME THERE'S A CORONATION IN BRITAIN 
THE RITUAL IS STAINED BY A DROP OF BLOOD SHED IN THIS ROOM 
ALTHOUGH HE WAS KEEN ON MURDERING MOORISH KINGS 
PEDRO WAS A MASSIVE FAN OF MOORISH ARCHITECTURE AND DECORATION 
WHEN HE DECIDED TO BUILD HIS OWN MOORISH PALACE NO EXPENSE WAS SPARED 
THE BEST MOORISH CRAFTSMEN WERE EMPLOYED TO CREATE AN ARCHITECTURAL JEWEL 
COMPLETE WITH INTRICATE MARBLE AND WOOD CARVING 
COOL SHADED COURTYARDS AND TILE WORK IN ALMOST HALLUCINOGENIC PATTERNS 
BUT WHY WOULD A CHRISTIAN CONQUEROR 
DRESS UP HIS PALACE IN THE STYLE OF THE ISLAMIC FOE 
YOU HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN PEDRO THE CRUEL'S SHOES AND THINK BACK TO FOURTEENTH CENTURY EUROPE 
WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN ARCHITECTURAL TERMS 
THERE'S THE GOTHIC BUT THAT'S FOR CHURCHES 
WHEN IT COMES TO PALACE ARCHITECTURE 
THERE'S NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH THIS FOR COLOUR RICHNESS PATTERN SENSUALITY 
THE WHOLE PLACE FEELS AS IF IT'S MADE OF ICING SUGAR I ALMOST FEEL I WANT TO EAT IT 
IT'S THE ULTIMATE ARABIAN KNIGHTS FANTASY ARCHITECTURE 
IF I HAD MY OWN LITTLE ALADDIN GENIE IN A BOTTLE AND I COULD WISH FOR 
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD I MIGHT JUST CHOOSE THIS PALACE 
BECAUSE THE ALCAZAR WAS A PALACE NOT A MOSQUE 
IT DIDN'T AROUSE THE USUAL SUSPICIONS OF MUSLIM WORSHIP 
AND THE CHRISTIAN KINGS OF SPAIN CLEARLY FELT FREE TO LOVE THIS PLACE TOO 
LATER MONARCHS PRESERVED IT AND MADE ANY ADDITIONS WITH SURPRISING SENSITIVITY 
SOMETIMES THE GREATEST COMPLIMENTS ARE THOSE PAID TO YOU BY YOUR ENEMY 
IT'S A PRETTY ASTONISHING TRIBUTE TO THE POWER AND GRANDEUR OF ISLAMIC ART AND ARCHITECTURE 
THAT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF SPANISH CATHOLIC MONARCHS 
SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED THIS PLACE TO REMAIN 
TO STAND AS A GREAT SHIMMERING GHOST OF A CULTURE THEY WERE DETERMINED TO ERADICATE 
BUT COULD NEVER QUITE BRING THEMSELVES TO STOP LOVING 
MOORISH STYLES REMAINED FASHIONABLE IN CHRISTIAN SPAIN 
SO MUCH SO THAT IF YOU WERE A CRAFTSMAN YOU WERE GIVEN SPECIAL TREATMENT 
BUT LIFE FOR OTHER MOORS WAS GETTING A LOT HARDER 
MOST FLED TO THE EXTREME SOUTH OF SPAIN WHERE THE LAST BASTION OF MOORISH MIGHT CLUNG ON TO POWER 
THOSE WHO REMAINED WERE FORCED TO CONVERT 
OR GO UNDERGROUND WHERE THEY MIXED WITH OTHER OUTCAST CULTURES LIKE THE JEWS AND THE GYPSIES 
THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF OUTSIDERS MOORS JEWS GYPSIES 
CAME TOGETHER IN DOWN AT HEEL PARTS OF TOWN LIKE TRIANA IN SEVILLE 
HERE THEIR DIFFERENT MUSICAL TRADITIONS FUSED TOGETHER 
TO CREATE A STYLE THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY RESURFACE SO IT'S SAID AS FLAMENCO 
NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE WHICH PARTS OF FLAMENCO COME FROM THE MOORS THOUGH THERE ARE MANY THEORIES 
THEY BROUGHT THE GUITAR TO SPAIN DESTINED TO BECOME THE NATION'S FAVOURITE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT 
AND THE DISTINCTIVE DANCE STYLE OF FLAMENCO 
IN WHICH DRAMATIC ARM AND HAND MOVEMENTS ARE FAVOURED OVER THE LEGS 
IS SIMILAR TO MOORISH DANCING 
WHICH FORBADE WOMEN FROM DRAWING ATTENTION TO THEIR LEGS 
THE SINGING STYLE IS SIMILAR TO THE WAILING ARABIC STYLE 
EVEN THE WORD FLAMENCO ITSELF COMES FROM AN ARAB WORD 
FELAGMENGU MEANING FUGITIVE PEASANT 
AND FLAMENCO IS ABOVE ALL THE MUSIC OF THE DISPOSSESSED 
WHAT'S THE FEELING THE ESSENTIAL SPIRIT OF FLAMENCO 
WHERE DOES IT COME FROM 
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO LEARN TO SING FLAMENCO 
IS THAT SPANISH FOR I'VE GOT NO CHANCE 
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO TEACH ME SOME VERY SIMPLE FLAMENCO 
LO SIENTO 
I'M ON THE LAST LEG OF MY JOURNEY AND I'VE COME SOUTH OF SEVILLE UP INTO THE HILLS 
BY THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THE ONCE MIGHTY EMPIRE OF 
AL ANDALUS HAD SHRUNK TO THIS SMALL MOUNTAINOUS REGION 
THIS WAS TO BE THE LAST BATTLEFIELD OF THE CENTURIES LONG CONFLICT 
BETWEEN THE FORCES OF ISLAM AND THE FORCES OF CHRISTIANITY 
THE CITY OF GRANADA WAS THE LAST MOORISH CAPITAL OF AL ANDALUS 
THE LAST CITY TO HOLD OUT AGAINST THE RECONQUEST 
THE NASRID DYNASTY RULED FROM HERE MANAGING TO RESIST CHRISTIAN INVASION FOR NEARLY TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
THOUGH TODAY YOU'D BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING THAT THE MOORS STILL RUN GRANADA 
IF YOU'RE IN THE MOOD YOU CAN AN ARABIC BATH IN ONE OF THE CITY'S MANY MOORISH BATH HOUSES 
AFTER TAKING THE WATERS YOU CAN VISIT A MOORISH TEA HOUSE AND TAKE SOME TEA 
AND IF YOU'RE FEELING PECKISH A TRIP TO A MOORISH RESTAURANT IS IN ORDER 
IT'S ALL VERY ATMOSPHERIC EVEN IF IT IS COMPLETELY FAKE 
A CONFECTION TO PUT THE TOURISTS IN AN APPROPRIATELY MOORISH MOOD 
BUT THE ONE REALLY AUTHENTIC MOORISH EXPERIENCE IS TO BE HAD 
IN THE ULTIMATE MOORISH PALACE THE ALHAMBRA 
EVEN HERE YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THE TOURISTS 
OVER SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE VISIT THIS EXTRAORDINARY SERIES 
OF ROYAL PALACES EVERY DAY TO HEAR TALES OF THE NASRID KINGS WHO USED TO LIVE HERE 
AND WHAT BLOODTHIRSTY TALES THEY ARE 
ACCORDING TO LEGEND THE ALHAMBRA WAS BUILT BY CHRISTIAN SLAVES IMPRISONED IN DARK DUNGEONS 
AND AT LEAST NINE OF THE NASRID KINGS WERE MURDERED BY METHODS AS 
DASTARDLY AS DROWNING STABBING AND EATING POISONED BATTER 
THE ALHAMBRA IS ABOVE ALL A PALACE OF MYTHS AND LEGENDS 
IT'S A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE FEEL A PROFOUND NEED TO TELL STORIES 
PARTLY TO EXPLAIN TO THEMSELVES THE NATURE OF THIS PLACE 
FOR EXAMPLE 
IT'S SAID THAT THE SULTAN USED TO SIT HERE ON HIS THRONE 
IT IS SAID THAT THIS DOOR HERE IS A FALSE ENTRANCE DESIGNED TO 
PUT OFF WOULD BE ASSASSINS ALTHOUGH EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE BLOODY HISTORY 
OF THE NASRID DYNASTY SUGGESTS THAT ASSASSINS WERE NOT TO BE EASILY FOOLED 
THEY USUALLY GOT THEIR MAN 
THE TRUTH IS THAT WE KNOW ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT THE PRECISE FUNCTIONS OF EACH OF THESE SPACES 
THE ONLY THING THAT WE CAN BE CERTAIN OF IS 
THAT THE ART AND THE ARCHITECTURE HERE IS ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING 
THE MOORS MAY HAVE BEEN COMING TO THE END OF THEIR POWER AND INFLUENCE IN SPAIN 
BUT THEY WERE DETERMINED TO GO OUT IN STYLE 
THE ALHAMBRA IS LIKE A GREATEST HITS OF MOORISH DESIGN WITH THE VOLUME TURNED UP TO TEN 
IT'S THE ABSOLUTE SUMMATION OF EVERYTHING THAT MADE THE ART OF ISLAMIC SPAIN SO EXTRAORDINARY 
A PLACE WHERE THE EXPRESSION OF POWER AND DEEP SPIRITUALITY 
THAT ETERNAL SEARCH FOR PARADISE ARE ABSOLUTELY INTERTWINED 
THERE'S SUCH A SCRUM OF TOURISTS IN THE ALHAMBRA TODAY 
THAT IT MAKES IT PRETTY DIFFICULT TO APPRECIATE THIS PLACE AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY MEANT TO BE APPRECIATED 
WHICH IS AS A SPACE OF CONTEMPLATION AND REFLECTION 
EACH OF THE SPACES IN THIS PALACE WERE MEANT TO BRING YOU CLOSER TO GOD 
AND THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF THIS WONDERFUL ROOM CALLED 
THE HALL OF THE AMBASSADORS WHICH IS ALL ABOUT PATTERN AND GEOMETRY 
THE NUMBERS SEVEN AND FOUR ARE REPEATED EVERYWHERE IN THIS SPACE 
SEVEN SIGNIFYING THE STAGES BY WHICH THE SOUL ASCENDS TO GOD 
AND FOUR REPRESENTING THE NUMBER OF AREAS INTO WHICH THE VAULT OF HEAVEN 
COULD BE DIVIDED AND WE SEE THAT REFLECTED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT CEILING 
BUT THE SEVEN AND THE FOUR LEAD US INELUCTABLY TO THE ONE 
AND THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT'S REINFORCED IN ALL OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS 
THERE IS NO GOD BUT ALLAH THERE IS NO CONQUEROR BUT ALLAH 
THIS IS A SPACE THAT'S DESIGNED HYPNOTICALLY THROUGH THE REPETITION OF PATTERN AND DESIGN 
AND INSCRIPTION TO FOCUS OUR MINDS SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY ON THE HIGHER REALITY OF GOD 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE DECORATION OF THE ALHAMBRA THAT INVOKES GOD 
THE VERY DESIGN OF THE ARCHITECTURE IS PERMEATED BY THE SPIRIT OF ISLAM 
IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL TENET OF ISLAM THAT THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD THERE IS NO REALITY OTHER 
THAN HIS HIGHER REALITY EVERYTHING WE EXPERIENCE IN THIS LIFE IS IMPERMANENT INSUBSTANTIAL 
BUT HOW DO YOU INTRODUCE THE IDEA OF IMPERMANENCE INTO ARCHITECTURE THE MOST STABLE OF FORMS 
WELL HERE AT THE ALHAMBRA THEY'VE DONE IT BY INTRODUCING WATER EVERYWHERE 
SEEN IN REFLECTION EVEN THE MOST SOLID OF THINGS SEEMS EPHEMERAL SHIFTING 
IN FACT THE WHOLE DESIGN OF THE ALHAMBRA IS AIMED AT MAKING 
THE PALACE APPEAR TO BE NOT QUITE OF THIS WORLD 
THE COLUMNS ARE SO SLENDER THAT THE ARCHES THEY SUPPORT SEEM TO FLOAT IN THE AIR 
AND THE INTRICATE WOOD AND STONE CARVING MAKES SOLID MATERIALS SEEM TO DISSOLVE INTO FRAGILE LACE 
I THINK THERE'S A WONDERFUL PARADOX ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE ALHAMBRA WHICH IS THAT YOU GET ALL 
THIS EFFORT TO CREATE A SENSE OF EFFORTLESSNESS THIS TREMENDOUS INTRICACY OF STRUCTURE TO CREATE 
THE FEELING OF A STRUCTURE THAT'S ON THE POINT OF ITS OWN DISAPPEARANCE 
LOOK AT THAT WONDERFUL HONEYCOMB VAULTING IN THE CEILING OF THIS SPACE 
STANDING IN HERE IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE STANDING AT THE BOTTOM 
OF A GLASS OF FIZZY WATER LOOKING UP AND WATCHING THE BUBBLES SPARKLE OFF TOWARDS INFINITY 
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING VERY MOVING IN THE FACT THAT THE MOORS CREATED A BUILDING THAT SEEMS 
TO BE ON THE BRINK OF DISAPPEARING JUST AS THEIR OWN CIVILISATION WAS ABOUT TO VANISH FROM SPAIN' 
THE ALHAMBRA TODAY REALLY IS THE GHOST OF THE GHOST OF WHAT IT WAS ONCE WAS 
BUT VISITING IT IS STILL AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL AND POIGNANT EXPERIENCE 
THIS WAS THE LAST HURRAH OF ISLAMIC CIVILISATION IN SPAIN 
THE VERY LAST EXPRESSION OF THAT BEAUTIFUL IDEAL OF PARADISE 
IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY NINE CHRISTIAN SPAIN WAS FINALLY UNITED WHEN THE CATHOLIC MONARCHS FERDINAND AND ISABELLA MARRIED 
HUNGRY TO RULE OVER A COMPLETELY CHRISTIAN NATION 
THEY LAUNCHED A FINAL ASSAULT AGAINST THE MOORISH SOUTH 
AND ON THE SECOND JANUARY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO AFTER TEN YEARS OF FIGHTING 
THE LAST NASRID KING MUHAMMED THE TWELFTH SURRENDERED THE PROVINCE OF GRANADA AND THE ALHAMBRA 
LEGEND HAS IT THAT AS THE DEFEATED MUHAMMED GAZED BACK AT THE CITY HE'D SURRENDERED HE BURST INTO TEARS 
HIS MOTHER UNIMPRESSED SNAPPED AT HIM 
YOU DO WELL TO WEEP LIKE A WOMAN OVER WHAT YOU FAILED TO DEFEND LIKE A MAN 
THE MOOR FAMOUSLY SIGHED HIS LAST SIGH AND TURNED HIS BACK ON GRANADA FOREVER 
THE CHRISTIAN RECONQUEST WAS COMPLETE 
THE VICTORS WERE MERCILESS TOWARDS THE VANQUISHED 
FERDINAND AND ISABELLA MADE IT LAW THAT PORK SHOULD BE EATEN THROUGHOUT THE REGION 
THEN IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
THEY EXPELLED ALL JEWS FROM SPAIN AND REVOKED THE RIGHTS OF MUSLIMS 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX ARABIC WAS BANNED 
AND THEN IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TEN ALL MOORS WERE EXPELLED FROM SPAIN 
WHETHER THEY HAD CONVERTED TO CATHOLICISM OR NOT 
AS SO OFTEN THE VICTORS IN THIS EPIC STRUGGLE RE WROTE HISTORY TO SUIT THEIR OWN MILITANT IDEOLOGY 
FOR CENTURIES AFTERWARDS THE WHOLE RICH HISTORY OF ARAB SPAIN WAS DESTINED TO BE REMEMBERED AS NO MORE 
THAN THE NATION'S LONG JOURNEY THROUGH A DARK TUNNEL 
AT THE END OF WHICH SHONE THE LIGHT OF THE CHRISTIAN RECONQUISTA 
AND THE ARABS THEMSELVES WERE REMEMBERED AS NO MORE THAN 
PANTOMIME VILLAINS IN A GREAT STORY OF CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH 
TODAY IN FESTIVALS ALL OVER SPAIN THE MOORS ARE STILL PORTRAYED AS PANTOMIME VILLAINS 
I'VE COME TO THE SMALL TOWN OF QUENTAR JUST OUTSIDE GRANADA 
TO WATCH THE LOCAL MOORS AND CHRISTIANS FESTIVAL 
EVERY YEAR THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN DRESS UP AND RE ENACT THE HISTORIC 
BATTLE BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM 
THE WHOLE THING GOES ON FOR THREE DAYS UNTIL THE MOORS ARE FINALLY DEFEATED 
FORCED TO CONVERT AND BAPTISED 
TO THE OUTSIDER IT DOES ALL LOOK JUST A BIT PUZZLING 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU HERE 
IS IT JUST A FIESTA OR IS IT MORE THAN THAT 
NO IT'S MORE THAN PARTY 
SO IT COMMEMORATES IT'S A CELEBRATION OF 
IT'S A CELEBRATION OF THE VICTORY OF CHRISTIANS 
IS THERE ANY 
POLITICAL PROBLEM WITH HAVING A FIESTA LIKE THIS YOU KNOW WITH THE MUSLIM PEOPLE IN SPAIN 
NOBODY MINDS NO HERE LIVES MOORISH 
WE HAVE NO PROBLEM 
YOU HAVE A MUSLIM COMMUNITY HERE 
YES THEY HAVE A MOSQUE 
THERE'S A MOSQUE HERE YES HERE 
WE HAVE NO PROBLEM IT'S TRADITION 
NO PROBLEM 
WE ARE ALL HAPPY 
SO IT'S MORE LIKE A STORY FROM THE PAST THAN 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PRESENT 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRESENT THE PAST ONLY ONLY FRIENDS 
OF COURSE IT IS ALL A BIT OF FUN 
BUT IT DOES SEEM A BIT DEPRESSING THAT THESE 
RE ENACTMENTS COMPLETELY IGNORE THE CULTURAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE MOORS 
BUT I THINK THINGS HAVE BEGUN TO CHANGE IN MODERN SPAIN AND IT IS A CULTURE MORE ACCEPTING OF ISLAM 
AFTER ALL THERE ARE NOW OVER ONE MILLION MUSLIMS LIVING IN SPAIN 
AND THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED MOSQUES 
THE NEWEST ONE IS HERE IN GRANADA DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE ALHAMBRA 
ON THIS SPOT MODERN SPAIN QUITE LITERALLY FACES ITS ISLAMIC PAST 
THE DISTANT WORLD OF AL ANDALUS 
AL ANDALUS IS PART OF THE LIFEBLOOD OF MODERN SPAIN IT'S PART OF WHAT MAKES THE SPANISH SPANISH 
BUT THE FACT IS THAT ARAB CULTURE HAS PLAYED 
A VITAL PART IN SHAPING WHAT WE OFTEN THINK OF AS WESTERN CIVILISATION 
ITS MUSIC ITS ART AND ARCHITECTURE ITS PHILOSOPHY 
YET SPAIN IS ALMOST THE ONLY PLACE IN MODERN EUROPE WHERE YOU CAN STILL TOUCH THAT HISTORY 
WHERE YOU CAN STILL ALMOST PHYSICALLY GRASP THE FACT 
THAT THE CULTURE OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD IS PART OF ALL OF OUR D. N. A.
