ON THE ISLES OF SCILLY THE NEW CHAPLAIN FATHER GUY SCOTT 
IS HAVING TO LEARN FAST ABOUT ISLAND WAYS 
THE BOAT BREAKS DOWN AND HIS ENTIRE DAY IS DISRUPTED 
I APOLOGISE FOR BEING LATE 
THE WIZARD IS DOWN AGAIN 
THE LOCALS WILL UNDERSTAND 
GETTING USED TO THE WAYS OF HIS NEW PARISH 
IS PROVING MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN FATHER GUY HAD IMAGINED 
IT'S BEEN HARDER THAN I THOUGHT 
MUCH HARDER THAN I THOUGHT TO BE HONEST 
AND TOBY AND HIS EX WIFE LIZ GOT OFF TO A FLYING START AT THE OPENING OF THEIR NEW PUB 
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST NIGHT THAT SAINT MARTIN'S AND THE SEVENSTONES HAS SEEN I THINK 
IN THE HISTORY OF THE PUB 
BUT CAN THEY REALLY MAKE A LONG TERM SUCCESS OF THE BUSINESS IN SUCH A REMOTE PLACE 
PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS OF THE FIVE INHABITED ISLES OF SCILLY 
TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS TRESCO AND PARTICULARLY ITS EXTRAORDINARY SEMI TROPICAL GARDENS 
HERE MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND EXOTIC PLANTS THRIVE IN THE BALMY FROST FREE 
CLIMATE NINETY PER CENT OF WHICH WOULD NEVER SURVIVE ON THE MAINLAND 
AND WITH THE COMING OF SPRING IT'S OFTEN THE LURE OF THE GARDENS THAT ATTRACTS 
CRUISE PASSENGERS FROM SHIPS WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY INCLUDING SCILLY ON THEIR ITINERARIES 
TODAY THE GARDENS ARE THE DESTINATION OF THE NEW CHAPLAIN TO THE ISLES FATHER GUY SCOTT 
HIS IS ONE OF THE MOST UNUSUAL PARISHES IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
AND HE'S SLIGHTLY BEMUSED BY SOME OF THE ODDER DUTIES HE'S REQUIRED TO PERFORM 
THE LATEST ADDITION TO THE GARDENS IS A STRANGE LOOKING LITTLE TREE FROM A SPECIES 
NINETY MILLION YEARS OLD THE OLDEST KNOWN TREE ON THE PLANET 
GARDENS CURATOR MIKE NELHAMS HAS ASKED GUY TO DO THE HONOURS AT A RATHER SPECIAL CEREMONY 
I JUST WANTED TO BRING YOU TO THIS TREE BECAUSE FATHER GUY HERE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BLESS IT FOR US 
THIS TREE WAS THOUGHT TO BE EXTINCT 
BUT THE REASON IT HADN'T BEEN KILLED OFF WAS THAT IN THIS RAVINE THAT IT LIVED 
IN THE BLUE MOUNTAINS JUST OUTSIDE SYDNEY 
ANY FOREST FIRES THAT THERE WERE WENT RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF IT 
THEY TOOK TWO HUNDRED CUTTINGS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED TREES THAT CAME TO THIS GARDEN 
SO IT'S REALLY VERY VERY SPECIAL 
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT GUY HERE TO TO LOOK AFTER IT FOR US 
SO IF I CAN PASS OVER TO YOU GUY 
THANK YOU MIKE 
I BLESS THIS LIVING TREE 
MAY IT PRODUCE FOR THOSE WHO RESPECT AND LOVE IT 
SHADE SHELTER AND REFRESHMENT IN ABUNDANCE 
FOR BIRDS BEASTS AND ALL PEOPLE 
AMEN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH GUY THAT'S MARVELLOUS THAT WAS REALLY VERY NICE 
IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO DO IT FOR YOU I DON'T THINK WE'VE HAD A TREE BLESSED IN THE GARDEN BEFORE 
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO BLESS ONE TREE THAT SHOULD BE THE TREE ABSOLUTELY 
HAVE YOU EVER BLESSED A TREE BEFORE I HAVEN'T NO DO YOU GET SORT OF AN I SPY TICK BOX YOU KNOW 
A GIG A HOUSE A TREE HAVE YOU NOT DONE A GIG YET NO YOU'LL HAVE TO DO A GIG 
THERE'S BOUND TO BE A GIG SOMETIME YEAH 
FATHER GUY'S NEXT DUTY WILL BE TO MEET THE ROYAL NAVY 
SCILLY HAS STRONG HISTORICAL LINKS WITH THE SENIOR SERVICE 
PART OF THE JOB OF CHAPLAIN IS TO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH PASSING SHIPS 
THIS MINESWEEPER HAS JUST ARRIVED AS PART OF THE CELEBRATION S. 
OF THE BIGGEST WEEKEND IN THE ISLAND'S YEAR 
IN A FEW DAYS' TIME IT'S THE WORLD GIG RACING CHAMPIONSHIPS 
FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS THE TRADITIONAL SIX MAN ROWING BOATS 
HAVE BEEN ARRIVING ON SCILLY FROM ALL OVER THE WEST COUNTRY 
CREWS FROM HOLLAND AND AMERICA WILL BE ARRIVING SOON 
IT'S AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THAT THE TINY ISLAND POLICE FORCE OF JUST TWO OFFICERS 
IS SUPPLEMENTED FOR THE SUMMER BY A THIRD 
LAST YEAR IT WAS WPC NIKKI GREEN WHO CAME ON SECONDMENT FROM AN INNER CITY BEAT IN PLYMOUTH 
HOW DO YOU DO HELLO YOU ALL RIGHT YEAH 
SHE SOON FELL IN LOVE 
WITH THE ISLANDS AND WHEN IT CAME FOR HER TO RETURN HOME LAST OCTOBER 
A TEARFUL WPC NIKKI GREEN VOWED TO BE BACK AS THIS SUMMER'S SECONDMENT 
BUT THINGS HAVE NOT GONE ACCORDING TO PLAN 
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS NIKKI'S BEEN STUCK ON THE MAINLAND 
CONFINED TO HER PARENTS' HOUSE JUST OUTSIDE PLYMOUTH 
HER BOSSES DID GIVE HER PERMISSION FOR HER TO RETURN TO SCILLY BUT INSTEAD FATE INTERVENED 
WELL I'VE BROKEN MY LEG 
I WAS OUT RUNNING ROUND THE COAST PATH 
AND IT WAS A BIT WET AND I THOUGHT I'D TRY OUT MY NEW TRAINERS THAT I'D BOUGHT 
I SLIPPED OVER AND BROKE IT 
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE SCILLIES IS IT OFF OR I DON'T KNOW 
IT DEPENDS ON HOW IT FEELS NEXT WEEK WHEN THE PLASTER COMES OFF 
DESPERATE TO GET BACK TO SCILLY NIKKI'S BEEN MAKING REGULAR VISITS 
TO THE FORCE DOCTOR HOPING HE'LL GIVE HER THE GO AHEAD TO RETURN 
BUT EACH TIME IT'S BEEN THE SAME STORY 
IS IT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH FOR YOU 
YEAH I'M GETTING USED TO IT NOW 
O. K. WE NEED TO SEE THE PLASTER OFF FIRST 
WE NEED TO SEE WHAT THE STATE OF YOUR LEG IS LIKE 
THEN I THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF HAVING THE FORCE PHYSIOTHERAPIST DO AN ASSESSMENT 
O. K. HOW DOES THAT SOUND YEAH BUT IT WON'T BE AS SOON AS I WANT IT TO BE WILL IT 
WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO MAKE IT HAPPEN BUT WE CAN'T HAVE YOU GOING OUT THERE UNFIT 
YEAH I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL REALLY AND I'D END UP 
INJURING MYSELF AGAIN AND HAVING TO COME BACK 
IT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD IDEA NO 
NIKKI KNOWS THAT IF SHE CAN'T GET BACK TO SCILLY BY THE BUSY GIG WEEKEND AND THE START OF THE SEASON 
HER BOSSES MAY THINK AGAIN ABOUT SENDING HER BACK AT ALL 
OVER ON THE MOST NORTHERLY OF THE ISLES OF SCILLY SAINT MARTIN'S 
THE ONLY PUB ON THE ISLAND IS GEARING UP FOR THE START OF SUMMER 
THE SEVENSTONES HAS BEEN BOUGHT BY TOBY THE BAKER ALONG WITH HIS EX WIFE LIZ 
THEIR AMBITION IS FOR THE PUB TO OFFER THE BEST FOOD ON SCILLY 
TOBY'S DETERMINED TO TRY TO AVOID USING FOOD IMPORTED FROM 
THE MAINLAND AND TO PRODUCE AS MUCH OF IT FROM THE ISLANDS AS POSSIBLE 
AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO SUPPLY ALL HIS OWN BREAD TOBY'S BEEN MAKING 
NUMEROUS TRIPS DOWN TO THE BAY BELOW HIS COTTAGE WHERE HE HAS HIS OWN PLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF EGGS 
THEN IT'S DOWN TO THE BEACH 
USING A LONG BEACH NET HE AIMS TO CATCH FISH FROM THE INCOMING TIDES 
THEN THERE ARE THE TURKEYS 
THIS IS A PRETTY IDYLLIC WAY OF LIFE FOR A MAN WHO'S LIVED FOR YEARS IN THE CITY 
THINK THEY THINK I'M A FEMALE THEY'RE DISPLAYING AT ME 
I KNOW I'M UGLY BUT I DIDN'T THINK I WAS THAT UGLY 
ALL THIS IS A FAR RUN FROM RUNNING A PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTERS IN THE HEART OF SOHO IN LONDON ISN'T IT 
YEAH JUST A BIT YEAH I WOULDN'T GO BACK 
LOBSTERS FOR THE PUB COME FROM MARK PENDER 
HOW ARE THOSE FOR SIZE 
RIGHT GOOD SIZE TWO POUND FISH POUND AND THREE QUARTER POUND FISH 
THEY'RE LOVELY SELECTED LOBSTERS THEY ARE 
BEEF WILL COME FROM THE CATTLE ON TRESCO THE NEXT DOOR ISLAND 
ICE CREAM FROM THE HICKS ON SAINT AGNES 
AND BEER FROM MARK PRAEGER THE RETIRED SCHOOLTEACHER WHO HAS SET UP HIS OWN BREWERY ON SAINT MARY'S 
PAULIE TOBY'S NEW YOUNG CHEF HAS TRAINED AT TOP RESTAURANTS ON THE MAINLAND 
AND IS ALSO PASSIONATE ABOUT HOME GROWN FOOD 
I'LL GET SOME MIZUNA 
VEGETABLES HERBS AND SALADS ARE ALL GROWN AROUND THE PUB 
BUT THERE'S ONE THING MISSING FROM THEIR MENU THAT THEY CAN'T SUPPLY THEMSELVES 
TOBY HAS PLANS TO CHANGE ALL THAT 
BUT FIRST WHAT'S THE TIDE BROUGHT IN FOR SUPPER 
IT'S THE LUCK OF THE DRAW 
SOMETIMES THE NET CAN BE BULGING WITH FRESH FOOD SOMETIMES NOT 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT SO FAR TOBY A HALF EATEN MULLET REALLY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK I THINK THE SEALS HAVE HAD A BITE 
I'M SHARING SUPPER WITH THE SEALS TONIGHT BUT THERE'S A COUPLE OF FILLETS ON THERE 
SO HAVE YOU GOT SOME SUPPER STILL LEFT ON THAT A TINY BIT 
YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF FILLETS THAT'S QUITE A MEATY BIT ISN'T IT 
OH YEAH IT'S GOOD SOLID FISH IT'S FANTASTIC FISH WHEN IT'S WHOLE IT'S BRILLIANT 
EVER SINCE HE'S BEEN HERE TOBY'S MADE AN EFFORT TO EMBRACE ISLAND WAYS 
SO WITH THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS ONLY DAYS AWAY IT'S ROUND THE BAY FOR THE EVENING GIG PRACTICE 
GIGS WERE DEVELOPED ON SCILLY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY TO RACE PILOTS OUT 
TO APPROACHING SHIPS AND WERE OFTEN USED AS LIFEBOATS OR FOR SMUGGLING 
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY AT STAKE ON THE UPCOMING WEEKEND 
NEARLY EVERYONE'S LIVELIHOODS DEPEND ON THE SUCCESS OF THE SEASON 
SO IT'S FINGERS CROSSED THAT THE LOVELY WEATHER WILL HOLD 
WITH THE START OF THE NEW BUSY PERIOD 
FATHER GUY'S FINDING IT TOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH THE WORKLOAD 
JUST GETTING AROUND SIX CHURCHES ON FIVE SEPARATE ISLANDS IS COMPLICATED ENOUGH 
GO IN PEACE TO LOVE AND SERVE THE LORD 
IT'S BEEN A MORE DIFFICULT START THAN I IMAGINED 
JUST THE FACT OF LIVING HERE REALLY 
ADJUSTING TO THE LOGISTICS GETTING USED TO 
BEING SO DOMINATED BY WEATHER AND THE SEA 
BEING IN THIS COMMUNITY ON AN ISLAND GIVES IT ANOTHER DIMENSION WHICH I HADN'T REALLY APPRECIATED 
I THOUGHT I COULD HAVE ADJUSTED TO THAT QUICKER BUT I'VE FOUND IT QUITE DIFFICULT ACTUALLY 
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 
AMEN 
GUY'S ALSO BEEN TAKEN ABACK BY THE BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EACH ISLAND COMMUNITY 
WHAT ONE ISLAND WANTS ANOTHER DOESN'T 
YES THERE IS THIS SCILLONEAN WAY OF DOING THINGS 
YOU HAVE TO LEARN THEIR WAY AND TO A DEGREE GO WITH IT 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO TAKE THEM AS THEY ARE 
YOU CAN'T FORCE YOURSELF ON THEM 
GUY HAS TWO LONG SERVING CHURCHWARDENS SUE AND FIONA TO HELP HIM RUN THE PARISH 
THEY'VE PICKED UP ON THE FACT HE'S HAVING TROUBLE SETTLING IN 
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT HAVE FUNNY VIBES 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HOW HAPPY HE IS WITH THE DISPARATE NATURE OF THE ISLANDS 
I THINK HE'S FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO COME TO TERMS WITH ONE PARISH 
AND 
AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT SEPARATE COMMUNITIES ON THE OFF ISLANDS 
THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT 
VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT 
YES EACH ISLAND HAS ITS OWN CHARACTER AND CHARACTERS 
YES AND IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE 
POOR MAN IF HE ARRIVES HERE AND DOES NOTHING ALL THE COMMUNITY WILL SAY OH HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING 
IF HE ARRIVES HERE AND TRIES TO CHANGE EVERYTHING AND RACE UP 
TO PEOPLE AND SAY HELLO HELLO I'M THE NEW VICAR 
THEY'LL ALL BACK OFF AND SAY WHAT'S HE THINK HE'S DOING CHURNING EVERYTHING UP 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN A SITUATION BASICALLY WHERE YOU CAN'T WIN 
YOU'VE GOT TO WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO ACCEPT YOU 
THE BIG GIG WEEKEND IS HERE AT LAST 
AND AS THE LAST OF THE GIGS ARRIVE THE SUN IS STILL BEATING DOWN 
THE BIG FEAR IS FOG WHICH HAS LED TO THE EVENT BEING CANCELLED IN PREVIOUS YEARS 
AND THE FAMILIAR FACE IS BACK ON THE BEAT WITH HARDLY EVEN A LIMP 
THE FORCE DOCTOR HAS GIVEN WPC NIKKI GREEN THE ALL CLEAR JUST IN TIME 
IT'S NICE TO BE BACK YEAH IT'S QUITE A WEEKEND THIS ISN'T IT ALL THE GIGS 
YEAH IT'S JUST STARTING TO GET BUSY 
I'VE JUST SEEN A BOAT IN AND I THINK SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE COME OFF THIS ONE 
AND SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE THIS MORNING SO WE'RE ALMOST DOUBLING OUR POPULATION IN A DAY 
YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS PLACE WHEN IT'S LIKE THIS 
BEING GIG WEEKEND THERE'S SUCH A NICE ATMOSPHERE HERE AS WELL IT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL ALL EXCITED 
IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT TO PLYMOUTH YES A BIT NICER 
IT'S A BIT NICER YOU DON'T MISS PLYMOUTH THEN 
NO NOT REALLY NO I DID WHEN I WENT BACK I JUST THOUGHT NO IT'S 
YOU COME OUT HERE AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU GO BACK AND THINK 
NO NO THIS IS THE PLACE FOR ME 
NIKKI CHECKS THE ARRIVALS OFF THE FERRY 
AND WITH SO MANY HUNKY YOUNG ROWERS AROUND NO DOUBT SHE HAS AN EYE FOR ANY AVAILABLE TALENT 
AS WELL AS THE GIGS THE SCILLONEAN BRINGS IN A HUGE RANGE OF OTHER GOODS THAT KEEP ISLAND LIFE GOING 
EVERYTHING MUST BE BROUGHT IN FROM THE MAINLAND BY SEA 
ONCE IT'S BEEN UNLOADED ON THE MAIN QUAY GOODS ARE DISTRIBUTED 
AROUND THE SMALLER ISLANDS BY THE OLD WORKHORSE THE LIONESS LADY 
THE LIONESS HAS CARRIED SOME ODD THINGS IN THE PAST BUT TODAY'S CARGO MUST BE AMONGST THE MORE UNUSUAL 
THIS TRAILER'S COME ALL THE WAY FROM DEVON AND NOW IT'S HEADING UP TO THE MOST NORTHERLY ISLAND SAINT MARTIN'S 
WAITING TO COLLECT THE SPECIAL DELIVERY IS TOBY FROM THE SEVENSTONES 
THE PRECIOUS CARGO'S DESTINED FOR SOME FIELDS UP AT THE BACK OF THE PUB 
IT'S THE FINAL MISSING INGREDIENT FOR THE NEW MENU 
THAT WENT QUITE EASY DIDN'T IT 
ALL OVER IN A FLASH REALLY WASN'T IT 
AS THERE ARE NO PIGS ON THE ISLAND THEY'VE BOUGHT IN THESE FOUR TASTY LOOKING GLOUCESTER OLD SPOTS 
TO PROVIDE THE PUB WITH A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF PORK 
TOBY LEAVES HIS TEMPORARY GUESTS TO SETTLE IN 
LATER ON SAINT MARY'S THE GIG WEEKEND IS UNDERWAY 
ONE HUNDRED BOATS ARE NOW ASSEMBLED IN THE BIGGEST FLEET EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE RACES 
TOBY'S IN THE OLDEST BOAT IN THE FLEET THE BONNET BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY AND STILL AS FAST AS THE BEST OF THEM 
HE'S WELL AWARE THAT ON SCILLY ROWING ISN'T A PASTIME IT'S A WAY OF LIFE 
THE THING ABOUT ROWING IS IT'S AN INCREDIBLE LEVELLER 
IT'S JUST A REFLECTION YOU KNOW AN EXTENSION OF ISLAND LIFE REALLY BECAUSE WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER 
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT AND WE ALL PULL TOGETHER REALLY 
AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT TO SURVIVE 
TO SURVIVE YEAH IT'S A BATTLE SOMETIMES TO SURVIVE 
IT'S LONG WINTERS AND SHORT SUMMERS AND YOU KNOW WE ALL WORK INCREDIBLY HARD ALL OF US 
AND WE ALL PLAY INCREDIBLY HARD 
FOR NEWCOMERS TO SCILLY LIKE HEIKE THE VET THE GIG WEEKEND'S A NOVELTY 
SHE'S TAKEN UP WHAT SHE THINKS IS A GOOD VANTAGE POINT TO SEE THE BOATS SET OFF FROM THE HARBOUR 
BUT JUST AS THE FIRST RACE IS ABOUT TO GET UNDERWAY DISASTER 
THE ONE THING EVERYONE HAD DREADED SUDDENLY ARRIVES 
WITHIN MINUTES THE FOG IS VIRTUALLY IMPENETRABLE 
ALL RACING IS CANCELLED 
THE GIGS HAVE NO NAVIGATIONAL AIDS AND WITH A STRONG WIND AND POWERFUL TIDAL CURRENTS 
IT WOULD BE TOO DANGEROUS TO ALLOW ANY ROWING AT ALL 
ALL THEY CAN DO NOW IS PRAY IT'LL CLEAR QUICKLY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS THEN 
THE WEATHER WELL IT'S A BIT OF A SURPRISE AND I THINK THEY'LL STOP THE RACE WHICH IS A BUMMER 
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE CAN YOU NOTHING IT'S JUST LIKE A MILK SOUP 
IT HAPPENED SO RAPIDLY THOUGH DIDN'T IT 
YEAH BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT HAPPENS HERE ALWAYS DOESN'T IT 
YOU CAN SEE IT COMING WHOOSH AND MAYBE IT STAYS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS 
A BIT DISAPPOINTING 
A BIT DISAPPOINTING YES VERY DISAPPOINTING 
EVERYBODY'S HERE TO WATCH THE RACES 
SO IT'S TERRIBLE 
OVER ON SAINT MARTIN'S LIFE HAS COME TO A STANDSTILL TOO 
ALTHOUGH UP AT THE SEVENSTONES BLISSFULLY UNAWARE OF LITTLE 
BEYOND THE WALLS OF HIS KITCHEN PAULIE THE CHEF IS HARD AT WORK 
HE'S ASSUMING THAT DESPITE THE FOG THE BIG PARTY TOBY'S PLANNED 
TO ROUND OFF THE WEEKEND AT THE PUB WILL STILL GO AHEAD 
AND AS A SINGLE LAD HE'S HOPING TO MEET SOME GIRLS 
THIS IS YOUR FIRST BIG BARBECUE ISN'T IT 
IT'S THE VERY FIRST ONE YEAH 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING WELL WE'RE ANTICIPATING ABOUT FIFTY 
BUT IT MIGHT BE UP TO EIGHTY OR NINETY NOW I'VE EVEN HAD SOME GUESTS FROM THE HOTEL COME UP 
IT'S GOING TO BE NICE TO BE OUTSIDE ON THE BARBIE SO I CAN SEE PEOPLE 
YOU'RE SORT OF TRAPPED IN HERE AREN'T YOU YOU CAN'T GO OVER AND SEE THE GIGS CAN YOU NO NO 
YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOADS OF GIRLS OVER THERE SO TOBY TELLS ME HE CALLS ME UP AND TELLS ME 
DOES HE I'M LIKE OH YEAH CHEERS TOB I'VE GOT TWO CUSTOMERS 
HOW DO YOU FIND A GIRLFRIEND 
DOWN HERE ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A GIRLFRIEND 
OH YEAH ALWAYS 
BACK ON SAINT MARY'S MUCH TO EVERYONE'S HUGE RELIEF THE FOG HAS 
MIRACULOUSLY CLEARED DISAPPEARING ALMOST AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME 
AND TO THE DELIGHT OF MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND ROWERS AND SUPPORTERS 
THE RACING GETS UNDERWAY IN NEAR PERFECT CONDITIONS 
THIS IS ALSO GUY'S FIRST GIG WEEKEND 
BUT DESPITE OFFERS HE'S HESITANT TO MUCK IN WITH THE ISLANDERS AND GET OUT ON THE WATER 
YOU'RE NOT TEMPTED TO HAVE A ROW YOURSELF NO I FEEL I'M TOO OLD 
WHAT THERE'S A VETERANS' 
I KNOW THERE'S VETERANS BUT I'VE NEVER DONE IT 
OH NO THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM YOU CAN START ANY TIME 
AND WHEN YOU WANDER AROUND AND SEE YOUR PARISHIONERS IN THIS KIND OF ENVIRONMENT 
WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND WHAT A LUCKY PERSON I AM REALLY 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL IT'S GORGEOUS ISN'T IT 
YES YEAH WHEN THE SUN SHINES 
LATER IT'S TIME FOR THAT APPOINTMENT WITH THE ROYAL NAVY 
GUY AND KATE JOIN OTHER ISLAND V. I. P.'S GOING OUT TO WATCH THE GIG RACING FROM A BIG RECEPTION BEING THROWN 
ON THE MINESWEEPER ANCHORED OFFSHORE 
ISLAND LIFE HERE IS STILL ESSENTIALLY MARITIME BASED 
THE NAVY'S KEEN TO KEEP UP ITS TRADITIONAL LINKS WITH ENGLAND'S 
MOST SOUTH WESTERLY OUTPOST AND ITS STRATEGIC POSITION GUARDING THE WESTERN APPROACHES TO THE CHANNEL 
BECAUSE THIS IS THEIR FIRST VISIT TO A NAVAL SHIP IN SCILLY 
GUY AND KATE ARE GIVEN A GUIDED TOUR OF THE MINESWEEPER 
THE SCREEN BEHIND YOU HERE IS ONE WE USE FOR MINE WARFARE 
DRIVING ALONG WE USE OUR SONAR TO SCAN THE SEA BED 
AND THEN WE'VE GOT TWO SMALL REMOTE CONTROLLED YELLOW SUBMARINES 
THEY CAN DROP A CHARGE ON THE MINE WITHDRAW TO SAFETY AND DETONATE IT 
ALL OUR HIGHLY SKILLED MINE CLEARANCE DIVERS 
OF WHICH DIVER MACNAMARA IS AN EXAMPLE CAN SWIM DOWN TO THE MINE 
SWIM DOWN TO THE MINE AND PLACE A CHARGE ON IT AND BLOW IT UP 
AND IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE ONE OF EACH OF THOSE TWO METHODS OF DESTROYING MINES 
THEN IT'S TIME FOR A COUPLE OF STIFF PINK GINS ON THE FOREDECK 
IT'S THE PERFECT VANTAGE POINT TO SEE THE FINAL RACE OF THE DAY 
IT TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL GIG WEEKENDS IN THE ISLAND'S HISTORY 
THERE'S SCARCELY STANDING ROOM IN THE PUBS WHERE AFTER THE LONG 
EMPTY MONTHS OF WINTER THE TILLS ARE RINGING LIKE NEVER BEFORE 
AND TRADITIONAL DRINKING GAMES ARE PURSUED WITH A DETERMINED ENTHUSIASM 
OVER AT THE SEVENSTONES PAULIE'S BARBECUE BREAKS ALL PUB RECORDS 
INSTEAD OF THE FIFTY MEALS THEY WERE ANTICIPATING 
BY THE END OF THE EVENING THE YOUNG CHEF HAS SERVED NO LESS THAN A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
GOOD MATE 
YOU'RE LOOKING BUSY 
YEAH IT'S PRETTY BUSY ARE YOU IN DANGER OF RUNNING OUT OF ANYTHING 
I'VE RUN OUT OF RIBS AND TUNA SO FAR 
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE O. K. FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT YOU THINK HOPEFULLY IT'LL FINISH SOON EH 
THANKS TO THE WONDERFUL WEATHER THE WEEKEND'S FESTIVITIES GO ON 
LONG INTO THE NIGHT AND END INEVITABLY DOWN ON THE BEACH 
BUT THERE'S ONE SMALL MYSTERY THAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED 
WPC NIKKI GREEN NORMALLY VERY MUCH THE PARTY ANIMAL WHEN SHE'S OFF DUTY IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND 
NIKKI'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOT BEEN SEEN OUT AND ABOUT SO MUCH RECENTLY 
IN HIS PREVIOUS PARISH FATHER GUY WOULD POP IN AND HAVE A PINT WITH THE LADS ALMOST EVERY NIGHT 
BUT HE'S REINED BACK ON THAT HERE 
AS WELL AS HIS OTHER PROBLEMS GUY'S BEGINNING TO REALISE JUST HOW LONELY THE JOB CAN BE 
PARTICULARLY WHEN HE'S GRAPPLING WITH DIFFICULT CONFIDENTIAL ISSUES 
HE'S SORELY MISSING THE BACKUP OF HIS FELLOW PRIESTS OVER ON THE MAINLAND 
IT'S THAT ADDED DIMENSION OF THIRTY MILES OF WATER WHICH MEANS IF A PARTICULAR ISSUE COMES UP AND 
I NEED TO TALK TO A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE CHURCH I'D MUCH RATHER DO THAT FACE TO FACE I CAN'T DO IT 
IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT START 
IT SOON BECOMES APPARENT WHY WPC NIKKI GREEN HASN'T BEEN SEEN AROUND MUCH DURING GIG WEEKEND 
MOST OF THE ISLANDERS DON'T KNOW IT YET BUT AFTER BEING 
UNLUCKY IN LOVE FOR SO LONG THINGS NOW SEEM TO BE MOVING VERY QUICKLY FOR THE YOUNG BOBBY 
I DID MEET SOMEONE NICE YEAH 
REALLY YEAH AND WHO'S THAT IT'S ANDREW 
SO IS HE A LOCAL LAD 
NO HE LIVES ON THE MAINLAND SAINT ERTH 
RIGHT HOW DID YOU END UP MEETING HIM 
UM 
WELL I'D SPOTTED HIM DURING THE DAY AND I THOUGHT OH WHO'S THAT 
AND THEN I SAW HIM IN THE MERMAID WHEN I WAS OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS 
SO I THOUGHT WELL AND WENT OVER AND SAID HELLO 
HE WAS TALKING TO SOMEBODY I KNEW SO I THOUGHT THERE'S MY THERE'S MY CHANCE 
AND THE REST IS HISTORY 
THE REST AS THEY SAY IS HISTORY 
I MEAN WE DO GET ON REALLY WELL 
WE'VE BOTH SAID YOU KNOW IT JUST SEEMS A BIT DIFFERENT 
WE'VE BOTH BEEN IN RELATIONSHIPS BEFORE BUT THIS ONE JUST SEEMS A BIT DIFFERENT 
AND IT'S NICE REALLY IT'S GOOD 
YEAH IT'S ALL REALLY GOOD 
NIKKI HAS NO IDEA WHEN SHE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE NEW BOYFRIEND AGAIN 
BUT THEN THAT'S ALL PART OF THE NATURE OF LIVING ON SCILLY 
IT'S NOT A WAY OF LIFE EVERYONE CAN ADAPT TO EASILY 
AS GUY'S BEEN FINDING OUT 
ON THE OFF ISLANDS SOME OF HIS VERY STRONG TRADITIONAL VIEWS HAVE NOT GONE DOWN AT ALL WELL 
HE'S UPSET ISLANDERS ON SAINT AGNES BY TURNING DOWN THEIR REQUEST TO 
HAVE SOME SUNDAY SERVICES WITHOUT COMMUNION 
AND AN INFLUENTIAL PARISHIONER ON SAINT MARTIN'S FOR REFUSING TO MARRY HIS DAUGHTER TO A DIVORCEE 
GUY ACCEPTS HE'S PARTLY TO BLAME FOR SOME OF THE BAD FEELING 
I AND OTHERS MAKE MISTAKES 
IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF WHAT I SAID OR WHAT I DIDN'T SAY 
OR MISCONSTRUED 
PASTORALLY SAYING NO IS DIFFICULT AND YOU WILL UPSET PEOPLE 
BUT YOU KNOW AS PRIESTS WE HAVE TO TRY AND HOLD TO OUR CONSCIENCE AND INTEGRITY 
AND IT'S DIFFICULT 
YES IT'S BEEN HARDER THAN I THOUGHT 
MUCH HARDER THAN I THOUGHT TO BE HONEST 
AND THERE'S ALWAYS THIS 
THEY SAY WHEN YOU START A NEW MINISTRY 
THAT YOU HAVE THIS HONEYMOON PERIOD 
AND ONE WOULD HOPE THAT LASTS A FEW WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS 
BUT MY HONEYMOON PERIOD HERE LASTED ABOUT A WEEK I THINK 
AND THEN THINGS STARTED HITTING OFF IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT YEAH 
SOME PEOPLE I THINK DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF 
WHAT WE DEAL WITH DAY BY DAY CANNOT BE SHARED WITH OTHERS 
I CANNOT GO TO THE MERMAID INN AND SAY OH SO AND SO'S BEEN TO SEE ME 
GUESS WHAT THEY SAID BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO 
AND CERTAINLY THE NATURE OF LIVING ON THESE ISLANDS IS THAT SMALL THINGS CAN SEEM TO ME 
TO BE BLOWN OUT OF ALL PROPORTION WHERE ON THE MAINLAND IT IS DIFFERENT AND THEY DON'T 
I'VE FOUND IT QUITE DIFFICULT 
SO WILL FATHER GUY IN TIME BE ABLE TO WIN OVER THE ISLANDERS 
OR IS HE BEGINNING TO REGRET COMING HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
IN THE NEXT PROGRAMME AS FRASER HICKS CELEBRATES THE SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY OF HIS LEGENDARY BOAT 
THE SEA KING THERE'S A QUESTION MARK OVER ITS FUTURE 
HIS DAUGHTER REBECCA'S FINDING IT HARD TO STAY ON SCILLY 
AND FULFIL HER AMBITION OF TAKING OVER THE FAMILY BOAT 
YOU'D LIKE TO STAY HERE IF YOU COULD OH YEAH 
YEAH ALL MY FAMILY'S HERE 
AND ALL MY FRIENDS ARE HERE AND STUFF AS WELL SO IT'S IT'S SAD 
WPC NIKKI GREEN MANAGES TO SNATCH A WEEKEND'S LEAVE ON THE MAINLAND 
BUT WHERE DOES IT GO FROM HERE 
AND FATHER GUY'S DIFFICULTIES SUDDENLY INCREASE WHEN THE ISLANDS ARE ENGULFED IN A TRAGEDY 
WHICH AFFECTS VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY 
AT TIMES THERE REALLY ISN'T ANYTHING I FIND YOU CAN SAY 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BE THERE WITH THEM AND TAKE THE ANGER 
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN ANGER OH A GREAT DEAL YEAH YEAH 
ONE GIL MCCRAE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MEMBER OF RIVAL GANG THE GLORY 
I DON'T WANT GANG WARFARE OUT THERE 
WE FOUND THIS NEXT TO VICTIM NUMBER THREE 
A NEW BREED OF CRIMINAL 
IT'S A CALL TO WAR 
HAS CREATED A NEW BREED OF COP 
AND IF YOU MISSED THE LAST EPISODE IT'S AVAILABLE NOW ON B. B. C. IPLAYER
