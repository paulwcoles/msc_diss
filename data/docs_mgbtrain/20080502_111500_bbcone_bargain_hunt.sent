NOW CLIFF COVENTRY IS FAMOUS FOR THE EXPLOITS OF LADY GODIVA 
RIDING AROUND WITH NO CLOTHES ON AND I GATHER YOU'RE SOMETHING OF THE SAME PERSUASION 
YOU LIKE HAVING A GOOD RIDE WITH NO KIT RIGHT YEAH 
I WAS AT A RACE MEETING AT THRUXTON AND WE HAD A BAND 
EVENING ENTERTAINMENT 
THEY WEREN'T GOOD SO ME AND A TEAM MEMBER THOUGHT WE'D STOP THEM PLAYING 
BY RIDING NAKED ON OUR PIT MOPED IN FRONT OF THEM 
IT WORKED FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
THAT'S QUITE A DISTRACTION THAT ISN'T IT 
IT DID HAVE ITS MOMENTS YEAH WHAT DO YOU WORK AT DOING 
I'M AN LGV DRIVER AT HEATHROW AND I'M ALSO BIG TIME INTO TRUCK RACING 
TRUCK RACING YEP 
THAT'S PRETTY DANGEROUS ISN'T IT IT HAS ITS MOMENTS 
WE CHANGED THE ENGINE AND THE CHAIN SNAPPED AND I HAD A TONNE OF ENGINE LAND ON MY HAND 
SO I SPENT TWO DAYS IN HOSPITAL SEVEN WEEKS OFF WORK AND SEVENTY TWO STITCHES 
OH DEAR ON YOUR POOR LITTLE PUDDY

TANYA HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SHARING YOUR FELLOW WITH ANOTHER WOMAN 
I'M USED TO IT NOW HE'S GOT A WHOLE ROOM OF MADONNA MEMORABILIA SO 
AND HE WAS WITH HER BEFORE ME SO IT'S O. K. 
YOU'VE FORGIVEN HIM THAT ONE I HAVE 
BUT YOUR INTERESTS LIE MORE WITH FOUR LEGGED FRIENDS DON'T THEY 
THAT'S CORRECT WE'VE GOT TWO ANIMALS AT HOME 
WE'VE GOT A KITTEN ABOUT FIVE MONTHS OLD CALLED PHOEBE 
AND WE'VE GOT A JACK RUSSELL CALLED STAR 
YOU'VE HAD SOME EXOTIC ANIMAL EXPERIENCES 
I DID YES WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN I WENT TO KENYA ON SAFARI WITH MY FATHER 
I WAS TIRED ONE AFTERNOON AND THOUGHT I'D HAVE A KIP 
LEFT MY DOOR OPEN AND I HEARD A LOUD BANG 
I SAT UP IN MY BED AND THERE WAS A BIG MALE BABOON 
SAT ON MY DRESSING ROOM TABLE 
PUTTING YOUR LIPSTICK ON 
WE BOTH JUST STARED AT EACH OTHER 
WHICH IS APPARENTLY ALSO VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE IF YOU STARE THEY TEND TO CHARGE 
BUT HE DIDN'T HE RAN OUT SO I PROBABLY OUT STARED HIM 
WE DON'T WANT ANY MONKEY BUSINESS TODAY 
YOU MUST BEHAVE YOURSELF 
NOW KEITH AND LINDA WELCOME 
KEITH YOU'VE BEEN IN THE AUDIO T. V. BUSINESS FOR YEARS 
SO IF WE HAVE ANY TECHNICAL PROBLEMS TODAY YOU'RE OUR MAN RIGHT 
MAYBE BUT I THINK YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH EXPERTISE HERE TO BE FAIR 
I DUNNO SOMETIMES THEY DON'T PLUG EVERYTHING IN 
WELL I'LL ALWAYS HELP 
WELL THAT'S BRILLIANT HOW DID YOU MEET YOUR PARTNER LINDA 
I WENT INTO THE BANK ONE DAY AND SHE WAS SELLING INSURANCE 
I'M NOT INTO INSURANCE BUT I THOUGHT SHE LOOKS O. K. 
SHE ASKED ME FOR ALL THIS INFORMATION WHICH I GAVE TO HER 
NO PROBLEM I THOUGHT SHE'S QUITE NICE 
SO I GO BACK THE NEXT DAY TO MAKE SURE SHE'D STILL GOT MY INFORMATION 
WELL QUITE ABSOLUTELY CHECK IT OUT AND SHE HAD 
AND SIXTEEN AND A HALF YEARS LATER YOU'RE STILL TOGETHER 
JUST ABOUT YEAH BRILLIANT VERY GOOD YEAH 
LINDA WHAT'S THE SECRET OF THIS SIXTEEN AND A HALF YEARS' TOGETHERNESS 
DID HE BUY AN ENDOWMENT POLICY OR SOMETHING IS THAT WHAT DID IT 
OUR ANSWER IS SEPARATE HOUSES 
WE BOTH RETAINED THE HOUSES WE HAD ORIGINALLY 
AND ALTHOUGH WE'RE WITH EACH OTHER SIX DAYS OUT OF SEVEN 
IT GIVES US THAT LITTLE BIT OF SPACE AND INDEPENDENCE THAT SUITS US 
THAT'S YOUR SECRET THAT'S OUR SECRET IT WORKS IT WAS 
THAT'S INTERESTING 
WORKS VERY WELL RATHER LIKE TANYA YOU'RE AN ANIMAL LOVER 
YES INDEED WE HAVE TWO CATS AT THE MOMENT WE GOT FROM THE R. S. P. C. A. 
AND I ALSO SPONSOR A DONKEY TUFTY 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THAT 
MANY YEARS I HOPE TUFTY'S STILL THRIVING 
THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME RECENTLY BUT I HOPE HE'S STILL WITH US 
YOU DON'T THINK THEY'RE JUST TAKING THE DOH RAY ME OFF YOU AND HE DIED SOME YEARS AGO 
I HOPE NOT BUT YOU NEVER KNOW 
WHAT SORT OF THINGS WILL YOU BOTH BE LOOKING OUT FOR TODAY 
I'M LOOKING HOPEFULLY FOR SOME SILVER AND I'M A LITTLE BIT INTO POTTERY AS WELL 
O. K. WHAT ABOUT YOU 
JUST ANYTHING THAT TAKES MY EYE SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE EASY ONE 
I AM INDEED I SHALL LEAVE IT TO THE EXPERT 
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF COMPETITION HAPPENING WHICH IS FANTASTIC NOW FOR THE MONEY MOMENT 
THREE HUNDRED APIECE THERE'S YOUR THREE HUNDRED YOU KNOW THE RULES 
YOUR EXPERTS AWAIT AND OFF YOU GO VERY GOOD LUCK 
SO WHICH COUPLE WILL BE GOING HOME WITH A TAKEAWAY TONIGHT 
AND WHICH WILL BE GOING OUT TO AN EXPENSIVE AND ROMANTIC MEAL FOR TWO 
MONITORING THE LEVELS OF PROFIT FOR THE REDS IS THOMAS PLANT 
AND LIMBERING UP TO COACH THE BLUES IS MARK STACEY 
WHAT ABOUT THESE GREAT SOME WAR MEDALS 
TANYA DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WAR MEDALS NOTHING 
WHAT APPEALED TO YOU ABOUT THESE MEDALS 
THE COLOURFUL RIBBONS IT'S COMPLETE WITH A BOX 
AND TELLS YOU WHO THEY ARE 
YOU COULD FIND OUT ABOUT THE CHAP WHO WAS GIVEN THEM 
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THEM 
I LIKE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE WAR 
SECOND WORLD WAR 
WHAT YOU HAVE GOT WHICH IS INTERESTING 
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE RIBBONS LOOK TO BE UN MOUNTED 
THEY'RE VERY FRESH 
AND ALL THE MEDALS AS WELL LOOK WHAT YOU COULD DESCRIBE AS BEING BOX FRESH 
THE BAR HAS NOT BEEN MOUNTED ON THE AFRICA STAR 
THESE MEDALS LOOK LIKE THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ASSEMBLED OR WORN 
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE WAY THE RIBBONS HAVEN'T BEEN ATTACHED TO A BAR 
THEY'VE NEVER BEEN PUT ON A BAR NEVER BEEN WORN 
THAT TELLS ME SOMETHING 
THE PERSON COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN ACTION YOU DON'T KNOW 
WOULD THEY BE CAMPAIGN STARS 
ABSOLUTELY THEY'RE CAMPAIGN STARS 
SO THIS MAN NOT ONLY WAS IN ITALY 
HE WAS IN AFRICA PROBABLY FIRST AND THEN ITALY 
AND THEN HE FOUGHT THROUGH THE WAR SO HE GETS HIS THIRTY NINE FORTY FIVE STAR 
WHETHER HE SURVIVED IS ANOTHER MATTER WE DON'T KNOW 
THE LAST MEDAL IS THE WAR MEDAL 
S. K. DYER ESQUIRE COULD BE THE MAN'S SON 
NORMALLY IT WOULD HAVE THE RANK AND THE SERIAL NUMBER AFTER THAT 
YOU COULD CERTAINLY GO FROM THERE AND MAYBE FIND OUT WHO THEY BELONGED TO 
SO TELL ME THE CRUCIAL CRUCIAL THING HOW MUCH ARE THEY 
FIFTY THREE FIFTY THREE 
WHAT D'YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IT'S A BIT EXPENSIVE WHAT D'YOU THINK CLIFF 
I BETTER GO AND DO SOME HAGGLING 
SHALL WE LET HIM GO I THINK SO YEAH OFF YOU GO 
HOW D'YOU RECKON HE'LL DO I THINK HE'LL DO O. K. 
CLIFF TOOK THE ACTION REQUIRED MOUNTING A GOOD DEFENCE AND SECURED THE MEDALS FOR FORTY FIVE 
I'VE FOUND THESE THEY LOOK REALLY NICE TO ME 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WELL WHAT ATTRACTS YOU TO THEM LINDA 
THEY LOOK SO PRETTY AND IN SUCH GOOD CONDITION 
BUT YOU'RE THE EXPERT YOU TELL ME ARE THEY 
THEY ARE REASONABLY THERE'S NOT A LOT OF WEIGHT TO THEM IS THERE NO 
THEY'RE KNOWN AS FILLED CANDLES 
IF YOU TOOK OFF THIS BAKELITE BASE 
INSIDE IT WOULD HAVE A FILLED MIXTURE 
THE SILVER ACTUALLY IS ALMOST LIKE A FOIL QUITE A THICK FOIL 
THEN THEY PUT THE SHEETS OUT IN THE FACTORY 
PUT THE DECORATION ON AND MOULD THEM INTO THE DESIGN THEY WANT 
I LIKE THE SIMPLENESS OF THEM 
THEY ARE REALLY ATTRACTIVE HOW OLD WOULD THEY BE 
THEY ARE FULLY HALLMARKED BIRMINGHAM NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT 
THEY'RE NOT ANTIQUE BUT THEY ARE NICE CANDLESTICKS D'YOU LIKE THEM KEITH 
YES YES I DO I FIND THEM APPEALING 
ABSOLUTELY WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE MARKER TODAY 
PEOPLE HAVE OFTEN TURNED AWAY FROM VERY FUSSY DESIGNS 
THEY WANT SOMETHING SIMPLER AT LEAST THEY'RE A PAIR 
YES CANDLESTICKS SHOULD ALWAYS BE A PAIR 
SO A GOOD BUY HOW MUCH ARE THEY 
I THINK THEY'RE ABOUT SIXTY FIVE OOH WELL 
WE NEED TO GET THAT DOWN A BIT OKEY DOKE 
LOOKING AT THEM I WOULD SAY THEY PROBABLY AT AUCTION AT FIFTY TO SEVENTY 
MAYBE SIXTY ON A GOOD DAY 
SO WE'RE NOT FAR OFF WE JUST NEED TO TWEAK THAT PRICE DOWN 
SO I THINK IF YOU WANT THEM GO OFF AND SMILE AT THE DEALER 
O. K. WE'LL GIVE IT A GO 
OFF YOU GO GO AND SMILE AT THE MAN 
WELL THEY WAXED LYRICAL TO THE DEALER TO BURN 
FIFTEEN QUID OFF THE ASKING PRICE PAYING FIFTY FOR THE CANDLESTICKS 
D'YOU FEEL A BIT OF A HANDBAG MOMENT COMING ON 
YOU GIRLS OUT THERE REALLY LOVE YOUR HANDBAGS RIGHT 
BUT IF YOU WERE WELL DRESSED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY 
YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE ONE OF THESE JOKERS HANGING ON YOUR ARM 
A LITTLE BAG 
WHICH HAS BEEN COVERED IN EXQUISITE HAND EMBROIDERED SILK 
EACH OF THESE AREAS HAVE BEEN BRIGHTLY WORKED IN SILKS 
WITH A VARIETY OF FLOWERS 
THE GREY AREA THAT LOOKS RATHER DULL WHEN THIS WAS MADE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO 
WOULD HAVE BEEN BRIGHT AND BRASH 
THE GREY AREA IS ACTUALLY SOLID SILVER 
THIS IS SILVER THREAD AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE INCREDIBLY INTRICATE WAY 
IN WHICH EACH OF THOSE THREADS HAS BEEN DRAWN 
TO MAKE UP THIS PIECE OF FOLIAGE 
YOU START TO GET THE IDEA OF QUITE WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY OBJECT THIS IS 
THE HANDLE ITSELF IS ALL COMPLETE 
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY RARE EXAMPLE 
OF AN ACCESSORY WHICH HAS SURVIVED FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
I THINK IT'S GREAT 
THIS THING IS PRICED AT ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED IS THAT EXPENSIVE OR NOT 
WELL I THINK IT'S RARE AND I THINK TO THE RIGHT PERSON 
IT COULD BE WORTH AS MUCH AS SIX HUNDRED OR EIGHT HUNDRED 
SO THAT'S WHY I'M OFF 
WHAT D'YOU THINK OF THIS YOU'RE A DOG LOVER AREN'T YOU 
I AM YES AN ANIMAL LOVER 
CLIFF ARE YOU AN ANIMAL LOVER 
I HAVE TO BE I GET NO CHOICE 
SO WHAT APPEALED TO YOU ABOUT THIS 
THE CUTENESS THE CUTENESS IS THAT IT 
WELL IT'S THE SAME SORT OF COLOURING AS MY DOG AS WELL 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS THIS IS BY DOULTON 
IT'S GOT THE PRINTED BACK STAMP FOR DOULTON 
WHAT'S THE IMPERATIVE THING ABOUT THIS DAMAGE 
PERFECT IT'S GOT TO BE PERFECT 
WELL DONE PERFECT FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTION AND PERFECT IT HAS TO BE 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT OLD 
SO YOU LOOK AT THE EXTREMITIES WHAT IS GOING TO GET DAMAGED 
IT'S GONNA BE THE EARS THE TAIL AND THE FEET 
ACTUALLY IT LOOKS IN GOOD CONDITION 
THESE WERE MADE AS IT HELPFULLY SAYS BETWEEN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR AND NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
SO WOW 
A LONG PRODUCTION LINE TANYA I CAN SEE ON HERE THERE'S A PRICE OF SIXTY FIVE 
THAT'S WHOOSH TOO MUCH 
ARE YOU GOING TO USE THOSE PUPPY DOG EYES 
I AM I'LL GO AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO FLATTER HIM HE'S A MAN YOU KNOW 
YOU CAN CHARM HIM OFF YOU GO 
GO ON WHAT D'YOU THINK WILL SHE DO ALL RIGHT 
SHE'LL GET HIM TO KNOCK IT DOWN 
SHALL I BE CANDID WITH YOU YEAH I HATE THOSE THINGS 
IT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD HAVE GONE FOR NO 
YOU BOYS MIGHT HATE IT BUT TANYA LOVES HER CUTESY TERRIER 
SHE PATTED THE PRICE DOWN TO A CRUFTY I MEAN CRAFTY FIFTY 
IF YOU FANCY YOURSELF AS A BARGAIN HUNTER 
AND WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US ON THE PROGRAMME 
E. MAIL US AT BARGAINHUNT AT B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K. 
GO ON YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO 
KEITH LINDA COME OVER HERE 
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND MARK IS THAT SOMETHING I SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN 
I THINK SO YES IT'S QUITE A NICE SHAPE ISN'T IT IT IS YEAH 
THE FIRST THING THAT ATTRACTED ME TO IT IS THE TRIANGULAR SHAPE 
THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DESIGN 
YOU SEE THESE LITTLE JAPANESQUE DESIGNS 
SO THAT TELLS US IT IS FROM THE VICTORIAN PERIOD 
THE AESTHETIC JAPANESQUE PERIOD OF THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTIES ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES 
SO IT'S GOT A GOOD AGE TO IT 
IT'S ALSO SIMULATED TO LOOK A LITTLE LIKE IVORY 
YOU'VE GOT THIS VERY NICE CARVED CARTOUCHE HERE MOULDED 
WITH A SKY BLUE BACKGROUND WHICH IS A NICE FEATURE 
JUST TURNING IT ROUND WE'VE GOT A NICE SIMPLE SCROLLING HANDLE 
WITH A LITTLE GILDING ON IT 
I PRESUME IT'S FOR CREAM OR MILK 
OR MILK YES SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WHEN WE TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN IT'S GOT THE MARK FOR WORCESTER 
RIGHT THE MARK WITH A FIFTY ONE IN THE MIDDLE 
THEY'RE A VERY GOOD MAKER 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S OLDEST PORCELAIN MANUFACTURERS 
THIS IS MADE OUT OF POTTERY DURING THAT PERIOD 
I THINK ALL IN ALL QUITE AN ATTRACTIVE PIECE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT'S QUITE GENUINE OBVIOUSLY I LIKE THE DESIGN 
IT'S UNUSUAL ISN'T IT 
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD FIND ON YOUR PART MARK I HOPE SO 
AND AND WELL THIS IS THE PROBLEM 
IT'S MARKED AT SEVENTY 
SO WE REALLY NEED TO GET THAT DOWN A BIT IF WE WANT TO BUY IT 
BUT I DO LIKE THE SHAPE AND I LIKE THE USE OF THE COLOURS 
SO IT MIGHT JUST BE WORTH A PUNT 
SHALL I LEAVE YOU TO NEGOTIATE 
YEAH I'LL LEAVE THAT TO HIM DEFINITELY YES 
COME BACK TO ME AND LOOK LIKE THE CAT WHO'S GOT THE CREAM ALL RIGHT 
VERY GOOD 
OH LINDA DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM BUT WELL DONE BLUES 
FOR CREAMING OFF A TENNER FROM THE ASKING PRICE TO JUST SIXTY SMACKERS 
USUALLY IN A A SPORTS CENTRE THE IDEA IS TO LOSE A FEW POUNDS BUT NOT ON BARGAIN HUNT 
ANY LEFTOVER LOLLY WILL BE GIVEN TO THE EXPERTS 
AND THEIR JOB IS TO GO OUT AND FIND THAT SPECIAL ITEM 
THAT'S GOING TO BOOST THE TEAM'S PROFITS AT AUCTION 
NOW THE CHOICE THOSE EXPERTS MAKE 
IS VITAL AS TO WHO I DECLARE THE WINNER AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMME 
NO PRESSURE HEY 
THIS IS MY CHOICE I FOUND THIS LITTLE COLLECTION OF CHINA 
SOMETHING I'M QUITE PASSIONATE ABOUT 
LINDA TELL ME IF YOU SAW THESE IN A SHOP TODAY 
ON THE HIGH STREET WOULD YOU THINK THEY LOOKED OLD FASHIONED 
NO I THINK THEY LOOK MODERN YOU THINK THEY LOOK MODERN 
I DO THINK IT'S MODERN 
THE STORY IS EVEN BETTER 
I THINK WE CANNOT LEAVE THINGS LIKE THIS BEHIND IN OUR HISTORY 
WHAT SORT OF AGE WOULD IT BE YOU THINK THEY LOOK MODERN 
THESE WERE DESIGNED AND MADE IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
THIS IS BY WEDGWOOD O. K. WE'VE ALL HEARD OF WEDGWOOD 
IT'S ON THE BASE HERE NICELY PRINTED WEDGWOOD 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS 
IS WHO IT'S DESIGNED BY IT'S DESIGNED BY RAVILIOUS 
HAVE YOU HEARD OF A MAN CALLED RAVILIOUS NO 
HIS NAME IS ERIC RAVILIOUS AND HE WAS AN ARTIST AND DESIGNER 
HE DID DESIGNS FOR CERAMICS AND ALSO BOOK ILLUSTRATIONS 
AND HE ALSO DID PICTURES AND DRAWINGS 
HE WAS A WAR ARTIST IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO HE WAS SHOT DOWN AND KILLED 
SO HIS LIFE WAS VERY SHORT HOWEVER HIS DESIGNS ARE TIMELESS 
HIS DESIGNS ARE WIDELY COLLECTED 
AND THIS PATTERN IS QUITE A COMMON PATTERN 
BUT YOU DON'T SEE MUCH OF IT 
HENCE WHY WE'VE GOT A MIXTURE OF ITEMS 
WITH ME EXPLAINING ALL OF THAT WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK 
PERSONALLY I LIKE THE ITEMS 
CLIFF IS LOOKING A BIT VACANT 
I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT PIECES 
IT DOESN'T MATCH THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY CONTINUITY IT'S NOT A SET 
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT THEY'RE NOT ALTOGETHER 
THEY'RE NOT ALL A SET THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLOURS 
THERE IS A COLLECTORSHIP FOR HIM 
REASON BEING HIS LIFE WAS CUT SHORT WOULD IT MAKE A PROFIT 
VERY GOOD QUESTION THERE ARE SEVEN ITEMS SEVEN BITS OF CHINA 
ALTOGETHER IT'S NINETY FOR THE SEVEN ITEMS 
I THINK THAT'S TOO MUCH 
I THINK IF WE CAN GET EACH ITEM FOR A TENNER WE'LL BE DOING WELL 
SHALL WE TRUST HIM I THINK SO YES THANK YOU GUYS 
TRUE TO HIS WORD THOMAS BOUGHT THE WEDGWOOD FOR TEN APIECE 
THAT'S SEVENTY QUID FOR THE LOT 
WHAT ARE YOU ADMIRING THERE

THE FIRST THING I GOT TO SAY IS BLUE FOR THE BLUE TEAM

O. K. GOOD 
IT'S FROM THE SORT OF NINETEEN TEN NINETEEN TWENTY PERIOD

I KNEW THE MINUTE I MET YOU THERE WAS GOING TO BE TROUBLE 
IT WAS MY FAULT 
I KNOW IT WAS I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU PUT UP WITH HIM 
I KNOW IT'S A WONDER YOU DON'T LIVE TOGETHER 
THERE YOU ARE THERE'S YOUR ANSWER

NOW IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE INTERLUDE 
WHEN THE B. B. C. DRAMATISED THE CLASSIC NOVEL JANE EYRE 
THEY NEEDED A MAGNIFICENT LOCATION FOR THE HOUSE OF THE ROMANTIC LEAD MR. ROCHESTER 
WELCOME DEAR VIEWER TO HADDON HALL 
NESTLED IN THE VALLEY OF THE RIVER WYE IN DERBYSHIRE 
THIS DRAMATIC AND IMPOSING BUILDING USED IN A B. B. C. SERIES 
HAS ALSO SEEN ITS FAIR SHARE OF REAL LIFE ROMANTIC DRAMAS 
INCLUDING ONE THAT CAUGHT THE IMAGINATION OF VICTORIAN SOCIETY 
IN A ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTIES GEORGE VERNON HAD A HEADSTRONG DAUGHTER CALLED DOROTHY 
AGED SEVENTEEN SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH JOHN MANNERS 
SON OF THE FIRST EARL OF RUTLAND 
HER FATHER VIOLENTLY DISAPPROVED OF THE MATCH 
SAYING HE WASN'T MERELY THE IMPOVERISHED SECOND SON OF AN EARL 
THE OTHER PROBLEM WAS 
THE MANNERS WERE PROTESTANTS AND THE VERNONS WERE CATHOLICS 
AND THAT WAS A BIG PROBLEM 
LEGEND HAS IT 
UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS THE COUPLE RAN AWAY TOGETHER 
ON THE NIGHT OF THE GREAT BALL TO CELEBRATE DOROTHY'S SISTER'S WEDDING 
THE LOVERS SLIPPED OUT OF A SIDE DOOR 
WHILST THE PARTY WAS IN FULL SWING AND ELOPED 
WHATEVER THE LEGEND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS 
THAT EVENTUALLY DOROTHY VERNON WAS FORGIVEN BY HER FAMILY 
IN FACT AFTER HER FATHER DIED SHE INHERITED THE ENTIRE ESTATE 
BECOMING LADY OF THE MANOR 
SO THE RUNAWAY COUPLE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER AT HADDON HALL 
NOW ALL OF THIS WOULD HAVE PASSED INTO LOCAL LEGEND 
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR ARTHUR SULLIVAN OF GILBERT AND SULLIVAN FAME 
WHO IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY TURNED THE WHOLE STORY INTO A MUSICAL 
NO FEWER THAN TWO NOVELS WERE BASED ON THE STORY 
TOGETHER WITH A BROADWAY MUSICAL 
AND EVENTUALLY HOLLYWOOD JUST COULDN'T RESIST 
THE FILM BASED ON THE LEGEND WAS CALLED DOROTHY VERNON OF HADDON HALL 
PLAYING THE LEAD THE SILENT MOVIE STAR OF THE TIME MARY PICKFORD 
NOT ONE OF HER OSCAR WINNING PERFORMANCES APPARENTLY 
ENOUGH OF ALL THAT HISTORY LARK 
LET'S FIND OUT WHETHER OUR TEAMS TODAY ARE GOING TO WIN AN OSCAR OVER AT THE AUCTION 
WE'RE LUCKY TO BE AT BIGWOODS SALE ROOM IN STRATFORD ON AVON 
TODAY WITH CHRISTOPHER IRONMONGER 
HELLO GOOD MORNING GREAT TO SEE YOU

A HEALTHY DEMAND FOR MEDALS 
COLLECTORS OF MEDALS NOW SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN 
MORE SORT OF RUN OF THE MILL EXAMPLES GOOD 
THAT'S ENCOURAGING WE'VE ESTIMATED THEM AT FIFTY TO EIGHTY 
WELL THAT'S DELIGHTFUL FORTY FIVE THEY PAID 
WHAT BETTER START COULD WE HAVE BE A GOOD START 
THE ROYAL DOULTON MODEL OF A TERRIER THAT'S CUTE 
HE'S FUN I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK OF THE ANIMALS WITH THE BESWICK ONES 
BUT I OFTEN THINK SOME OF THE DOULTON ONES HAVE A BIT MORE CHARACTER TO THEM 
BETTER QUALITY SOMETIMES YEAH IT IS Y. E. S. 
I MEAN WE'VE SAID TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE NOT ENOUGH I'M SORRY FIFTY WE NEED 
WELL IT MIGHT JUST MOVE ON A LITTLE 
WE HAVE TO HOPE THERE ARE SOME TERRIER FANCIERS ABOUT 
DEFINITELY ANYWAY THERE'S A BIT OF HOPE 
YES I THINK SO NOT TOO BAD 
NOW HERE'S A DESIGNER TO WHET THE COLLECTORS' APPETITE 
OLD ERIC RAVILIOUS DOING IT FOR WEDGWOOD 
IT'S A NICE LITTLE GROUP ISN'T IT 
WELL IT IS I MEAN HE 
HIS NAME WILL SORT OF ATTRACT THE INTEREST TO IT 
UNFORTUNATELY THE COLLECTION OF PIECES WE HAVE 
IS A BIT OF A MUDDLE REALLY 
YOU'VE GOT SOME OF THE BLUE OF THE PATTERN AND THE GREEN 
YOU'VE ONLY GOT A FEW PLATES ONE TEACUP 
ONE COFFEE CUP AND A SLOP BOWL 
WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY MUCH OF A SET YOU WON'T HAVE A PARTY WILL YOU 
NOT REALLY NO BUT 
WANT CUP OF TEA BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT IN A COFFEE CUP 
YES THAT'S IT YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ITS PRACTICALITY THEN YOU'RE RIGHT 
IT'S PRETTY WELL USELESS IT'S PURELY HIS NAME AS A DESIGNER 
ANYWAY THERE WE GO AS YOU SAY A BIT OF A MIXED BAG 
NOT A SET BY ANY MANNER OF MEANS 
WE'VE SAID THIRTY FORTY OH DEAR 
SEVENTY IS WHAT THEY PAID 
I THINK THAT'LL BE A STRUGGLE

THIS IS WORTH ROUND ABOUT FORTY TO SIXTY WITH THE TENDER 
THIS IS WORTH ROUND ABOUT THIRTY TO FIFTY FORTY TO SIXTY 
I THINK WE'RE UP TO AROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE I SPENT ON IT 
HOWEVER I THINK WE COULD GET OUT OF JAIL AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
I DON'T SEE A HUGE PROFIT 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YOU SPENT

SMALL PROFIT SMALL PROFIT WE'RE ABSORBING ALL OF THAT 
IT'S BEEN ABSORBED BEEN ABSORBED

SO WE USED TO HAVE THESE WIND UP THINGS 
TO GO WITH THE CANDLELIGHT AND ALL THE REST OF IT 
WE COULD SELL IT TO YOU THEN 
I THINK YOU CAN COUNT ME OUT ON THIS ONE 
SO WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE ON THIS LOT THEN THIRTY TO FIFTY 
OH MY GOD 
OH DEAR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOMAS PAID 
NO CHANCE THEN I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA BE ONE THAT'LL MAKE ANY PROFIT 
I THINK WE'LL SEND THOMAS PLANT BACK TO THE NURSERY THERE WE GO 
THAT'S IT FOR THE REDS NOW FOR THE BLUES 
NOW THEIR FIRST ITEM ARE THESE 
FILLED SILVER CANDLE STICKS 
WHICH IS A BIT OF A FRAUD REALLY ISN'T IT 
WELL IT IS BUT NOT UNCOMMON BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 
IT GAVE THE WEIGHT TO THE CANDLE STICK WITHOUT USING TOO MUCH SILVER 
THAT'S THE FRAUD THAT'S THE FRAUD 
CANDLE STICKS STILL SELL QUITE WELL IN SILVER BECAUSE THEY HAVE A USE 
PEOPLE PUT THEM ON THE TABLE 
FOR A CANDLELIT MEAL AND THAT SORT OF THING 
THE ROMANTIC MOMENT YES THERE ARE A FEW ABOUT 
THIS IS THE IRONMONGER AT HOME YOU CAN SEE THIS COMING ON 
THEY'RE QUITE MODERN THEY'RE NOT FLASHY 
I MEAN THEY'D GO ON QUITE A MODEST MODERN DINING TABLE 
FAIRLY SIMPLE IN DESIGN WE SAID THIRTY TO FORTY FOR THEM 
THEY PAID FIFTY SO IT'S NOT SO FAR OFF 
THEY COULD WELL SEE THEIR MONEY OR A LITTLE PROFIT 
NOW NEXT UP IS THIS RATHER UGLY TRIANGULAR JUG 
SAID TO BE WORCESTER BUT IT LOOKS LIKE EARTHENWARE TO ME 
AND I QUITE LIKE THE AESTHETIC MOVEMENT 
BUT I FIND THAT YELLOWISH PROCESS WITH IT LOOKS RATHER DIRTY 
WOULD YOU WANT TO POUR YOUR CREAM OUT OF THAT 
IT DOESN'T EXCITE ME 
LOOK AT THIS STUFF SOME AMATEUR HAS GONE ALONG WITH HIS GREAT MITT 
AND DAUBED A BRUSH ON I THINK I THINK IT'S HIDEOUS ACTUALLY 
IT HASN'T GOT THE FINESSE OF MANY WORCESTER PIECES BY A LONG SHOT 
WE'VE SAID SIXTY TO EIGHTY HAVE YOU 
SIXTY TO EIGHTY THEY ONLY PAID SIXTY WELL THAT'S BRILLIANT 
WELL PERHAPS IT'LL REDEEM US FROM OTHER THINGS 
I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT'S GONNA BE LIKE 
PUSHING A WHEELBARROW UPHILL BUT ANYWAY I HOPE I'M WRONG 
NOW CARLTON WARE 
I MEAN THAT'S NOT A BAD PIECE IS IT IT'S A GOOD SIZE 
NO PROBABLY A YEAR OR SO AGO 
IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE REALLY MOTORED 
WE FOUND THAT PROBABLY CARLTON WARE REACHED A PEAK 
ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND HAS NOW CALMED A LITTLE 
WE'RE A YEAR LATE 
LAST YEAR IT WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER 
THANKS FOR THAT REASSURANCE THAT'S KIND OF YOU 
IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE SHOWY PIECE 
A LITTLE BIT OF WEAR ON THE GILDING AROUND THE TOP 
A REASONABLY SALEABLE PEACE 
SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED I THINK THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
WE MIGHT GET THERE YES SO ALL QUITE NEAR THE BUTTON ACTUALLY

WILL IT MAKE US ANYTHING AT ALL CLARICE CLIFF IS POPULAR 
IT'S A NICE LITTLE SHAPE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO COLLECT INDIVIDUAL SHAPED PIECES

WE'LL TRUST YOU WE'RE DESPERATE
