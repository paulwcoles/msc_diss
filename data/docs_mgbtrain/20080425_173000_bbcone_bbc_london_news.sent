WASN'T DRUNK AND WASN'T IN THE 
WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME BUT 
HE DIDN'T DESERVE TO DIE FOR IT 
AND HOW THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF 
RICE IS AFFECTING THE CAPITAL'S 
RESTAURANT TRADE AND WE REVEAL THE 
FORGOTTEN HISTORY OF LONDON'S FIRST 
OLYMPIC GAMES 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME WE DON'T WANT REVENGE WE WANT 
JUSTICE THE WORDS OF A WOMAN 
WHOSE BROTHER WAS STABBED TO DEATH 
BY A NEIGHBOUR MARK WOODS TRIED TO 
GET INTO EDWIN PITKIN'S HOUSE 
THINKING IT WAS HIS OWN FRONT DOOR 
TODAY THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE 
SAID IT WON'T BRING AN PROSECUTION 
TELL US EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THAT 
NIGHT BEHIND ME IS THE HOUSE WHERE 
THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD MARK WOODS USED TO LIVE 
ONE FEBRUARY NIGHT HE HAD BEEN OUT 
DRINKING ALL DAY IN CELEBRATION OF 
WHAT WAS GOING TO BE HIS BIRTHDAY 
HE DRANK ALL DAY HE GOT SO DRUNK 
THAT HE FORGOT WHERE HE LIVED HE 
MISTOOK HIS OWN FRONT DOOR HE WENT 
TO NUMBER FORTY ONE INSIDE LIVED MR. EDWIN 
PITKIN HE WAS ASLEEP AND HEARD A 
COMMOTION HE TOOK A KITCHEN KNIFE 
ON THE DOORSTEP A STRUGGLE ENSHUED 
MR. WOODS WAS STABBED ONCE THROUGH 
THE HEART AND KILLED HIM TODAY THE 
CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE DECIDED 
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO 
PROSECUTE MR. PITKIN MR. WOODS'S 
SISTER SAID SHE'S DEVASTATED BY THE 
DECISION AND IT SHOULD BE UP TO A 
JURY TO DECIDE THAT 
THE WHOLE 
FAMILY IS TOTALLY DEVASTATED WE 
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WE FIRMLY HEARD 
FROM WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE POLICE 
ON THE EVIDENCE THEY WERE 
COLLECTING THAT A PROSECUTION WOULD 
BE FORTHCOMING WE WANT FOR THIS 
CASE TO BE HEARD BY A JURY NOT BY A 
LAWYER SITTING BEHIND A DESK WE 
CAN'T THIS MAN TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS 
ACTIONS NO ONE IS SAYING THAT MY 
BROTHER WASN'T DRUNK AND WASN'T IN 
THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME 
BUT HE DIDN'T DESERVE TO DIE FOR IT 
WHAT HAS THE CROWN PROSECUTION 
SERVICE HAD TO SAY 
THE LAW IS 
WRITTEN VERY GENERALLY VERY 
DELIBERATELY TO MAKE SURE IT'S KEPT 
VERY EASY AS TO HOW YOU INTERPRET 
THE LAW WHETHER A HOME OWNER IS 
ACTING LAWFULLY OR UNLAWFULLY 
WHETHER PROTECTING THEIR OWN 
PROPERTY AND LOVED ONES THE C. P. S. 
DECIDED THERE WASN'T ENOUGH 
EVIDENCE THAT MR. PITKIN WAS ACTING 
UNLAWFULLY WHEN MR. WOODS DIED WE WE HAVE CONSIDERED ALL THE EVIDENCE 
THAT THE POLICE HAVE MADE AVAILABLE 
TO US WE TOOK GREAT CARE TO LOOK 
AT THE LAW AND THE FACT WE WERE 
QUITE CLEAR THIS WAS NOT A CASE 
WHICH PASSED THE EFFICIENT 
DETENTION TEST FOR PROSECUTION L. 
OBVIOUSLY EXTEND BY SYMPATHIES TO 
THEM FOR THIS TRAGIC LOSS WHAT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT MR. WOODS SISTER SAYS 
THEY WANT TO WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL 
THE INQUEST WHEN SHE WILL PUT HER 
CASE MR. PITKIN AND HIS FAMILY HAVE 
MOVED AWAY 
MEET THE A VINCI ROBOT COULD THIS 
BE THE FUTURE OF SURGERY IN OUR 
HOSPITALS HOSPITALS IT'S A GROWING PHENOMENON ON THE 
STREETS OF THE CAPITAL THE 
INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME AMONG 
TEENAGERS SO FAR IT HAS BEEN 
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL GATES UNTIL NOW 
A TEENAGER HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY 
STABBED INSIDE SOUTH LONDON 
SCHOOL EYEWITNESSES TOLD B. B. C. 
LONDON A GANG WITH DOGS FORCED WAY 
INTO SALESIAN SCHOOL YESTERDAY TO 
FIND THEIR VICTIM MANY SCHOOLS IN 
SOUTH LONDON WERE CLOSED YESTERDAY 
BECAUSE OF THE TEACHERS STRIKE THE 
SALESIAN SCHOOL IN BATTERSEA STAYED 
OPEN AN EYEWITNESS TOLD US A GROUP 
OF FORTY OR FIFTY YOUTHS GATHERED 
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL BY THE CLOSE OF 
THE DAY YESTERDAY A SMALLER GROUP 
GOT INSIDE THE SCHOOL DESPITE THE 
HEAVY SECURITY HERE THEY HAD TWO 
DOGS WITH THEM THE SMALLER GROUP 
OF YOUTHS MADE THEIR WAY TO THE 
DETENTION HALL WHERE THEY BEAT 
THEIR DOGS WITH CHAINS TO MAKE THEM 
MORE AGGRESSIVE ACCORDING TO THE 
EYEWITNESS THE VICTIM WAS PICKED 
OFF AND HELD TO THE FLOOR WHEN HE 
TRIED TO ESCAPE FOR A THIRD TIME HE 
WAS STABBED FIVE TIMES IN THE BACK 
HE WAS TAKEN BY AIR AMBULANCE TO 
HOSPITAL WITH HEAVY BLEEDING AND 
PUNCTURED LUNG HIS CONDITION IS NO 
LONGER LIFE THREATENING AND HE'S 
STARTING HIS RECOVERY TODAY 
THERE'S AN INCREASED POLICE 
PRESENCE AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL 
DAY PEOPLE LIVING NEARBY THEY ARE 
SHOCKED BY THE ATTACK BUT NOT 
SURPRISED 
IT'S WHERE THEY ARE SURPRISED COMING FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER 
AND THIS IS LIKE THIS IS MY 
TERRITORY WHY ARE YOU HERE YOU 
CAN LITERALLY LOOK AT SOMEONE THE 
WRONG WAY OR SAY SOMETHING AND 
THEY WANT TO KILL YOU 
POLICE HAVE 
ARRESTED PEOPLE AGED BETWEEN THIRTEEN AND 
SIXTEEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTACK 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT PASSED ON 
COMPLAINTS OVER THE CONDUCT OF THE 
CHINESE SECURITY GUARDS IN THE 
TORCH MARCH THE HOME SECRETARY 
JACQUI SMITH STRESSED THAT THE 
GUARDS WERE NOT GIVEN POLICING 
POWERS WHILE IN THE CAPITAL 
MORE THAN FORTY POLICE OFFICERS HAVE 
ASKED TO KEEP THEIR IDENTITY SECRET 
INTO THE KILLING OF JEAN CHARLES DE 
MENEZES THE FAMILY OF JEAN CHARLES 
DE MENEZES WERE AT A PREINQUEST 
HEARING TO OPPOSE THE PLAN THEY 
WERE TOLD THREE THOUSAND PAGES OF EVIDENCE 
HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BUT NO 
QUESTION WAS MADE ON ANONYMITY THE THE FAMILY FEELING HOPEFUL WE HAVE TO 
WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE CORONER 
DECIDES THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
TO THEM IS THE SCOPE IS WIDE SO 
ALL THE ISSUES PERTINENT CAN BE 
ADDRESSED ADDRESSED NOW IT'S BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY 
PRECIOUS COMMODITY IN RECENT 
MONTHS THE COST HAS SOARED THIS 
TIME LAST YEAR THE COST WAS THIRTY 
TODAY IT HAS DOUBLED TO SIXTY FOR 
BILLIONS AROUND THE GLOBE ROCKETING 
PRICES HAVE HAD SEVERE IMPLICATIONS 
IT'S ALSO CAUSING PROBLEMS CLOSER 
TO HOME CHECKING CHECKING UP ON 
WHAT IS FAST BECOMING AN EXPENSIVE 
STAPLE THE MANAGER TELLS HIS CHEFS 
RICE WANT BE WASTED PRICE IS 
BECOMING A PROBLEM 
WE'RE WORRIED 
RICE IS ONE OF THE OUR MAJOR 
PRODUCTS BUSINESS MAY GO DOWN AND 
PROFIT WILL GO DOWN IN THE LONG 
RUN WE MAY LOSE OUR BUSINESSES 
HERE RICE IS SERVED WITH EVERYTHING 
COSTS 
HAVE RISEN BY ONE HUNDRED A WEEK WE WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS 
PRODUCTION LESS THAN DEMAND AROUND 
THE WORLD WE HAVE HAD FALLING 
STOCKS ALONG WITH RISING 
POPULATION AROUND THE WORLD EIGHTY 
MILLION NEW PEOPLE AND GROWTH 
WEALTH THAT MEANS PEOPLE'S DIET 
CHANGES THEY WANT MORE MEET AND 
DAIRY FOOD AND THAT INCREASES 
DEMAND FOR GRAIN 
RESTAURANT OWNERS 
SAY CONDITIONS ARE PRETTY TOUGH 
AND NOW THEY FACE THE DIFFICULT 
PROPOSITION OF HIGHER PRICES AND 
PASSING IT ON TO CUSTOMERS 
IT WILL 
NOT STOP ME HAVING CURRY BECAUSE 
THE PRICE OF RICE HAS GONE UP 
PRICES WILL GO UP FURTHER 
DIFFICULT CHOICES WILL HAVE TO BE 
MADE THE QUESTION IS WILL 
LONDONERS PAY THE PRICE TO EAT OUT 
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT GOING INTO 
HOSPITAL FOR AN OPERATION ONLY TO 
FIND OUT THAT THE SURGEON ISN'T 
HUMAN BEING BUT A ROBOT IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT EXPERTS SAY WILL BE 
COMMONPLACE WITHIN TEN YEARS THE 
PIONEERS ARE WORKING NOW IN A 
LONDON HOSPITAL HERE AT SAINT MARY'S 
HOSPITAL PROFESSOR JUSTIN VALE IS 
CARRYING OUT A PROSTATECTOMY ON A 
PATIENT DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER ONE ONE OF THE MOST INTRICATE PARTS OF THE 
OPERATION IS THE JOINING OF THE 
BLADDER WITH THE UE REGION YA WHAT WHAT IS DIFFERENT IT WILL BE PERFORMED 
BY THE ROBOT THE INSTRUMENTS ARE 
ATTACHED TO THE ROBOT'S ARMS 
OPERATED REMOTELY BY A SURGEON 
THEY ARE USED TO CARRY OUT 
PROSTATECTOMY TUMOUR REMOVALS 
GASTRO AND NEURO OPERATIONS IT'S 
LIKE HAVING HANDS ONLY SEVEN 
MILLIMETRES IN SIZE GREAT FOR THE 
PATIENT SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD CLIFFORD 
BROOKS WAS DIAGNOSED WITH EARLY 
PROSTATE CANCER LAST YEAR AND HAD 
A PROSTATECTOMY USING THE D. A. VINCI 
ROBOT JUST NINE MONTHS AGO 
I FEEL 
GREAT I'VE BEEN FEELING GOOD SINCE 
A MONTH AFTER 
SOON SURGERY COULD 
INVOLVE NO INCISIONS AT ALL 
PROFESSOR YANG IS DEVELOPING A 
GROUND BREAKING ROBOT 
IT WILL WORK 
LIKE A SNAKE IT GOES ALONG 
THROUGH AREAS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO 
BE ACCESSED BY CONVENTIONAL 
INSTRUMENTS OR ROBOTIC INSTRUMENTS 
AND REALLY FACILITATE OR SIMPLIFY 
THOSE PROCEDURES SUCH AS 
CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY SEVERAL SEVERAL HOURS LATER AND THE D. A. VINCI ROBOT 
HAS DONE ITS JOB 
IT IS INEVITABLE 
WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS WE CAN'T 
BE PUTTING A SKURN'S HAND IN A 
PATIENT'S BODY WE'LL USE DO ALL 
SURGERY USING SMALL INSTRUMENTS 
THAT ARE CLEVER AND CAN MOVE IN A 
PRECISE WAY 
STAY WITH US FOR THE 
WEEKEND'S SPORT INCLUDING HOW IT
