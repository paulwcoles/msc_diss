THERE ARE SOME MORE SHEEP THROUGH ONE OF THE WINDOWS COME ON 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE 
ARCHED WINDOW 
LOOK AT ALL THESE SHEEP AND LAMBS 
THE SHEEP HAVE LONG WOOLLY COATS THESE ARE CALLED FLEECES 
THIS IS ALAN AND HIS DOG SAM 
THEY'RE BRINGING IN THE SHEEP TO HAVE THEIR FLEECES CLIPPED OFF 
THIS IS CALLED SHEARING 
IT'S A BIT LIKE HAVING A HAIRCUT 
THESE SHEEP ARE ALL WAITING TO BE SHEARED 
THE SHEEP IS STRUGGLING A BIT BUT DON'T WORRY ALAN ISN'T HURTING IT 
THE SHEEP HAS STOPPED STRUGGLING 
IT'S PROBABLY GETTING USED TO THE CLIPPERS 
SHEARING A SHEEP IS VERY QUICK 
IT TAKES ABOUT TWO MINUTES TO DO EACH ONE 
THE SHEARER CLIPS VERY CLOSE TO THE SHEEP'S BODY 
SO THAT ITS FLEECE WILL COME OFF IN ONE PIECE 
DOESN'T THE SHEEP LOOK DIFFERENT WITHOUT ITS FLEECE 
WHEN ALL THE SHEEP HAVE BEEN SHEARED 
THE FLEECES ARE ROLLED UP AND PUT INTO BIG SHEETS CALLED WOOL SHEETS 
AND THEN THEY'RE SENT AWAY 
TO BE SORTED WASHED AND SPUN INTO BALLS OF WOOL 
DIDN'T THE SHEEP LOOK DIFFERENT WITHOUT THEIR FLEECES ON 
THEY STILL KEEP WARM THOUGH AND THEIR FLEECES GROW BACK 
AND I KNOW A SONG ABOUT A SHEEP 
BUT THIS SHEEP'S LOST

I'M GOING TO MAKE A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY CARD 
WITH A SURPRISE INSIDE 
I'VE FOLDED OVER A BIT OF CARD SO IT LOOKS LIKE A BIRTHDAY CARD 
THERE WE GO BUT THAT'S A BIT BORING ISN'T IT 
SO WE'LL DECORATE THE FRONT 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A BIRTHDAY CAKE 
GET A PIECE OF PAPER LIKE THAT 
I'M GONNA STICKY SOME STICKY GLUE ON THE BACK 
AND I'M GOING TO STICK THAT TO THE FRONT OF THE CARD 
THERE WE GO 
AND THERE 
BIRTHDAY CAKES SOMETIMES HAVE BITS OF RIBBON AND THINGS AROUND THEM 
I'VE GOT A PIECE OF RIBBON HERE 
IF I PUT SOME STICKY GLUE ON THAT TOO LIKE THAT 
THEN I CAN STICK THAT TO THE CARD 
AND MAKE IT LOOK MORE LIKE A BIRTHDAY CAKE 
THERE IT IS 
IF I PUT SOME STICKY DOTS ON TOP OF THE CAKE 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
I'VE GOT SOME SCRUNCHED UP BITS OF PAPER THERE 
I CAN DECORATE THE CAKE WITH THOSE 
PUT A YELLOW BIT THERE ON THAT BLOB OF GLUE AND THEN A RED BIT THERE 
AND THEN A BLUE BIT AND THEN A GREEN BIT 
AND THERE'S THE BIRTHDAY CAKE 
WHAT HAVE I FORGOTTEN WHAT DO BIRTHDAY CAKES NORMALLY HAVE 
CANDLES IF I GET A PIECE OF PAPER LIKE THIS ONE 
AND I TWIST IT AROUND 
LIKE THAT 
I'LL PUT THIS ONE HERE WITH SOME STICKY GLUE 
THERE 
I'VE GOT ANOTHER PIECE OF TWISTED PAPER 
BIT OF STICKY GLUE 
AND THERE'S TWO CANDLES 
AND BECAUSE THIS BIRTHDAY CARD'S FOR SOMEONE WHO'S THREE YEARS OLD 
I'M GOING TO PUT A THIRD CANDLE THERE 
NOW HAVE YOU EVER BLOWN OUT CANDLES ON A BIRTHDAY CAKE 
HAVE YOU IT'S GOOD FUN ISN'T IT 
I'M GONNA PUT SOME STICKY GLUE ON TOP COS I'M GONNA MAKE SOME FLAMES 
FOR THE TOP OF THE CANDLES 
ON MY STICKY GLUE I'M GONNA PUT SOME GLITTER 
I'LL SPRINKLE IT ON THERE 
AND SPRINKLE SOME MORE ON THERE 
AND THEN SPRINKLE SOME MORE ON THERE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WILL LOOK LIKE WHEN I SHAKE ALL THIS GLITTER OFF 
READY 
THERE 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE CANDLES HAVE GOT FLAMES ON THEM 
I CAN KEEP ALL THAT GLITTER ON THE PAPER AND USE IT LATER ON 
NOW FOR THE SURPRISE BIT 
I'LL PUT THE CARD OUT OF THE WAY 
I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME BALLOONS TO GO INSIDE THE CARD 
I'VE GOT THREE BITS OF COLOURED PAPER HERE THAT ARE A ROUND SHAPE 
AND THEY'LL BE LIKE PARTY BALLOONS 
I'LL PUT A BIT OF STICKY TAPE ALONG THEM 
AND I CAN KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER ONE PIECE THERE WHOOPS 
PUT THE NEXT PIECE IN AS WELL 
SO ALL THE BALLOONS ARE STUCK TOGETHER 
AND I'VE GOT SOME DANGLY BITS OF STREAMERS HERE 
COS BALLOONS HAVE BITS OF STRING OR RIBBON ON THEM 
I'VE GOT US SOME PARTY STREAMERS HERE 
YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE ANYTHING 
SOME WOOL OR SOME RIBBON 
THAT CAN MAKE YOUR PARTY BALLOONS LOOK NICE 
WITH DANGLY BITS UNDERNEATH THEM 
BIT MORE STICKY TAPE FOR THIS MIDDLE ONE THERE 
AND THEN ONE LAST PIECE OF STICKY TAPE 
FOR THE END LIKE THAT 
AND TO MAKE THE SURPRISE PART FOR THE CARD 
I HAVE A BOINGY BIT OF CARD 
IT'S A NORMAL PIECE OF CARD BUT IF I FOLD IT LIKE THAT 
AND THEN FOLD IT AGAIN AND THEN FOLD IT AGAIN 
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 
WATCH IT LOOKS BOINGY 
AND I CAN STICK ONE END TO THE BALLOONS 
WITH SOME STICKY TAPE AND THEN 
AND THEN I CAN STICK THE OTHER END TO THE CARD 
SO THAT WHEN I OPEN UP THE CARD 
THE PARTY BALLOONS SHOULD BOING OUT 
THERE WE GO A BIT OF STICKY TAPE THERE 
AND STICK IT INTO THE CARD LIKE THAT 
SO ON THE OUTSIDE IT'S A LOVELY BIRTHDAY CARD WITH THREE CANDLES 
BUT WHEN I OPEN IT UP BOING HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
WITH SOME BIRTHDAY BALLOONS
