THE ASPIRATIONS OF TODAY'S BRITISH TEENAGERS HAVE CHANGED 
LET ME GET THE GIRLS OUT 
IN A RECENT SURVEY OF GIRLS AGED FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN ALMOST TWO THIRDS ADMITTED 
THAT GLAMOUR MODELLING IS THEIR DREAM JOB 
I WANT THIS SO MUCH I JUST DON'T WANNA GO HOME 
BUT IT'S A CUT THROAT INDUSTRY 
IF WE WERE SELLING ARMPITS THAT WOULD BE THE SHOT 
AND ONLY A FEW MAKE IT TO THE TOP 
WE CAN START ON THIS THE HAIR AND MAKE UP IS PERFECT 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS 
GLAMOUR AGENCY SAMANTHA BOND MANAGEMENT REVEALS THE TEARS 
THEY SAID I WAS SO GOOD AND YOU ARE AND YOU ARE GOOD 
THE TANTRUMS 
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SPORT WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON I'VE DONE TOPLESS IN NUTS 
AND THE PRESSURES THEY SAID THAT I WAS FAT BASICALLY 
THIS IS LIFE AS A GLAMOUR GIRL 
MODELLING IS NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS PEOPLE THINK IT IS 
THIS WEEK NEW GIRL AMY DIAMOND IS GIVEN A MAKEOVER 
NOT VERY GLAMOUR MODEL AT THE MINUTE IS IT 
NINETEEN YEAR OLD JENNA SANSOM HAS SOME PROBLEMS WITH HER LOOK TOO 
SAM BOND KIND OF SAID THAT I WAS FAT BASICALLY 
AND STRUGGLING MODEL LOUISE GLOVER GETS HER FIRST CASTING IN WEEKS 
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF ME IN MY NORMAL CLOTHES I'LL LET YOU KNOW 
AFTER THIRTY YEARS IN THE BUSINESS SAM BOND KNOWS SUCCESS MEANS FINDING THE RIGHT GIRL FOR THE RIGHT JOB 
OH HI IS MARCUS THERE PLEASE 
MODEL BOOKER CHRISSY HAS JUST TAKEN ON AN ASSIGNMENT 
WHICH COULD BRING IN THOUSANDS 
ANY IDEA HOW MANY GIRLS YOU WANT TO SEE 
ABOUT LIKE SIX TO TEN 
THE JOB IS FOR LINGERIE COMPANY JANET REGER 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE JANET REGER WEBSITE 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR TWO GIRLS ONE FOR A CAMPAIGN FOR THEIR USUAL RANGE 
AND A MODEL WHO CAN CARRY OFF SOMETHING A BIT RACIER 
THEY WANT TO SEE SOME GIRLS FOR NAUGHTY JANET AND SOME GIRLS FOR JANET REGER 
THEY HAVE ONE NAUGHTY DESIGNER AND ONE NICE 
YES EXACTLY MORE RACY LINGERIE THAN JUST YOUR ORDINARY LINGERIE 
CHRISSY HAS TO SELECT THE RIGHT GIRLS FROM A LIST 
OF TOPLESS AND LINGERIE MODELS ON THE AGENCY'S BOOKS 
SHE JUST NEEDS ONE VITAL BIT OF INFORMATION THE CUP SIZE REQUIRED 
OH HI HELENA IT'S CHRISSY HIYA YOU SAY YOUR SAMPLE SIZES ARE THIRTY FOUR B. 
IS THAT FOR THE NAUGHTY RANGE AS WELL NAUGHTY RANGE 
YOU'D RATHER HAVE NATURAL O. K. COOL ALL RIGHT THEN 
O. K. GREAT THANK YOU BYE 
H. M. M. SHE'D PREFER NATURAL 
AND THIRTY FOUR B. 
THE GIRLS ON SAM'S BOOKS ARE CURVIER THAN THE AVERAGE LINGERIE MODEL 
SO THE PRESSURE IS ON FOR CHRISSY TO FIND GIRLS THAT LITERALLY FIT THE BRIEF 
THAT'S NOT A B. NO SHE LOOKS LIKE A C. 
I WONDER IF WE COULD GET AWAY WITH C.'S 
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S NOT A B. 
O. K. WE'LL KEEP WORKING ON IT 
ALL RIGHT DARLING 
BYE 
IN FACT SHE COULD EVEN BE A D. COULDN'T SHE 
THE THING IS I DON'T KNOW WHAT A D. CUP IS ANY MORE 
EVERYBODY SAYS THEY'RE A D. 
PEOPLE WITH SMALL BOOBS ARE A D. 
PEOPLE WITH BIG BOOBS ARE A D. 
D. IS THE SIZE TO BE YEAH WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS CONTRACT D. ISN'T THE SIZE TO BE 
WITH VERY FEW SIZE B. CUP GIRLS ON THEIR BOOKS CHRISSY DECIDES TO IGNORE THE BRIEF 
FOR NOW I'M GOING TO PUT DOWN THIRTY TWO D.'S 
WELL THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE CHANGED BRA SIZES 
MAYBE THIRTY TWO D. IS THE NEW THIRTY FOUR B. 
CHRISSY FINALLY GETS A SHORTLIST TOGETHER 
BUT WILL ANY OF THEM BE RIGHT FOR THE JOB 
OH HI JENNA IT'S CHRISSY 
I'VE GOT A CASTING FOR YOU ON SIXTH NOVEMBER 
IN NORTH LONDON NINETEEN YEAR OLD JENNA SANSOM IS ONE OF THE MODELS 
WHO COULD MAKE CHRISSY'S SHORTLIST FOR THE JANET REGER LINGERIE CASTING 
I JUST LOVE SEEING MYSELF IN MAGAZINES IN THE PAPER 
GOING TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND DOING DIFFERENT PICTURES 
I DON'T JUST WANT TO BE A GLAMOUR MODEL I WANT TO DO MAKE UP 
NOT HAIR BECAUSE I DON'T WANT MY HAIR CUT SHORT 
JENNA LEFT SCHOOL AT SIXTEEN AND STARTED MODELLING AT SEVENTEEN 
SHE DID HER FIRST TOPLESS SHOOT FOR THE STAR THAT YEAR 
SHE WAS PAID ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
I DON'T EXPECT TO MAKE A MILLION BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY 
IT'S MY HOBBY AS WELL AS MY JOB 
SO THAT'S WHY I LOVE IT SO MUCH 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SEE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE BEING 
A GLAMOUR MODEL DOESN'T LAST THAT LONG MAYBE FIVE YEARS TOPS' 
I'M NOT EXPECTING TO MAKE IT BIG LIKE JORDAN 
COS THERE NEVER WILL BE ANOTHER JORDAN 
MODELS AT THE VERY TOP OF THEIR GAME 
CAN COMMAND FEES OF UP TO TEN THOUSAND FOR A COVER SHOOT 
THE REALITY FOR GIRLS LIKE JENNA IS VERY DIFFERENT 
AT THE MOMENT I'M ONLY REALLY DOING PAGE THREE 
YOU CAN'T REALLY LIVE OFF THE MONEY THAT PAGE THREE PAYS 
MODELLING HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM 
IT WAS ONLY SINCE I WAS SEVENTEEN THAT I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO BE A MODEL 
AND I'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH 
TO BE ABLE TO PUSH MYSELF TO ACHIEVE THAT 
FOURTEEN MONTHS AGO JENNA WAS DROPPED BY THE AGENCY AFTER PUTTING ON WEIGHT 
SAM BOND KIND OF SAID THAT I WAS FAT SUPPOSEDLY 
I FELT A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE AND THOUGHT O. K. THAT'S FINE IF THAT'S HER OPINION THEN THAT'S HER OPINION 
I HAVE LOST SOME WEIGHT NOW 
AND I THINK ME GOING BACK TO HER SHE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED HER MIND 
DESPITE THE DEMAND FOR CURVIER GIRLS IN GLAMOUR WORK THE PRESSURE 
TO MAINTAIN A PARTICULAR WEIGHT IS CONSTANT THE INDUSTRY STILL DEMANDS THE RIGHT SIZE CURVES 
JENNA HAS DROPPED FROM A SIZE TEN TO AN EIGHT TO GET BACK ON THE AGENCY'S BOOKS 
IN LIVERPOOL ESTABLISHED MODEL AMANDA HARRINGTON HAS DIFFERENT PRIORITIES 
SHE'S COLLECTING HER SIX YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SAVANNAH FROM SCHOOL 
SHE MANAGES TO JUGGLE BEING A SINGLE MUM WITH WRITING A COLUMN 
FOR THE LIVERPOOL ECHO AND HER MODELLING CAREER 
I NEVER REALLY PLANNED TO SET OUT ON BEING A MODEL 
I GOT SOME PICTURES DONE AND MY FRIEND SENT THE PICTURES OFF 
AND THEN I WON A COMPETITION IN NUTS MAGAZINE 
CAN I PLAY WITH MY TWIZZER 
WHAT'S A TWIZZER IT'S THIS 
AMANDA WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PURSUE HER CAREER WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF HER EXTENDED FAMILY 
THERE'S A LOT OF MUMS WHO HAVE BROKE UP WITH THE DAD AND THEY DON'T GET NO HELP AT ALL 
BUT SAVANNAH'S DAD IS BUZZING SO WITH MY FAMILY 
WITHOUT THEM I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO HALF THE THINGS I DO SO I AM REALLY GRATEFUL 
THERE'S ME TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO BE A CHEF 
I'VE MESSED UP THE YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS 
BUT SHE STILL FEELS GUILTY ABOUT LEAVING HER DAUGHTER 
IT IS HARD IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT PEOPLE AROUND YOU WHO CAN HELP YOU 
BUT SOMETIMES I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN DOING A NINE TO FIVE 
BECAUSE LIKE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A NINE TO FIVE THEY'RE NOT GETTING 
HOME FROM WORK UNTIL SIX OR SEVEN O'CLOCK AND THE KIDS ARE IN NURSERY 
EVEN THOUGH I MIGHT BE AWAY FOR A FEW DAYS AT A TIME 
I'LL COME BACK AND THEN I'VE GOT DAYS TO SPEND TIME WITH HER 
AMANDA WAS WELL AWARE OF THE EFFECTS HER JOB MIGHT HAVE ON HER SIX YEAR OLD 
SO SHE DECIDED EARLY ON NOT TO DO TOPLESS MODELLING 
I THINK SHE'S AT THAT AGE NOW WHERE PEOPLE SAY STUFF TO HER 
NO ONE SAYS HORRIBLE THINGS THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I DIDN'T EVER WANT TO DO TOPLESS 
BUT THE KIDS IN SCHOOL SAY OH YOUR MUM IS IN THE PAPER 
SO I DID FEEL A BIT BAD 
BUT SHE'S NOT BOTHERED I SAY JUST LAUGH AT THEM AND IGNORE THEM 
FINISHED YEAH 
AMANDA IS DETERMINED TO MAKE IT IN THE GLAMOUR GAME WITHOUT GOING TOPLESS 
THAT'S A TALL ORDER IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE THE GREATEST SUCCESS LIES IN DOING JUST THAT 
HI HI I'VE GOT A MEETING WITH SAM BOND 
WHAT IS YOUR NAME JENNA 
BACK IN LONDON JENNA IS ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
IF SHE HAS SLIMMED DOWN ENOUGH TO SATISFY SAM AND NICKY 
HELLO HELLO HOW ARE YOU I'M FINE THANK YOU 
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
NICE TO SEE YOU O. K. 
HELLO ARE YOU O. K. YEAH 
SO YOU HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A WEIGHT PROBLEM THERE FOR A WHILE 
YEAH SO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT 
WELL I'VE LOST LIKE TEN L. B. 
OH WELL DONE LET'S HAVE A LOOK TAKE YOUR COAT OFF DO A STRIP 
THESE PICTURES 
YOU'RE IN GOOD SHAPE NOW 
OH THAT'S BRILL WELL DONE 
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY WORKED HARD 
YES I HAVE YOU CAN SIT DOWN 
WAS IT JUST COMING UP TO LONDON 
YEAH AND I'VE BEEN WALKING LOADS I STARTED GOING TO THE GYM WHEN I WAS BACK IN DEVON 
AND STEF HAS GOT ME ON GOOD EATING REGIMES SO THAT'S GOOD 
O. K. GREAT SO THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T GET YOU WORK O. K. COOL 
THANK YOU O. K. SPEAK TO YOU SOON BYE BYE DARLING 
IT WENT REALLY REALLY WELL 
THEY SEEM REALLY HAPPY WITH ME AND THEY SAID THERE'S NO REASON 
WHY THEY SHOULDN'T START GETTING ME WORK 
SHE'S LOOKING LOVELY 
YES SHE IS HER HEIGHT'S GREAT 
AND SHE IS IN GOOD SHAPE 
JENNA'S BACK ON THE BOOKS IN TIME FOR TOMORROW'S REGER CASTING 
BUT IS AGENCY ADVICE ON WEIGHT LOSS ADDING TO THE PRESSURE 
WE ARE CERTAINLY ONLY SAYING IT WITH THEIR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY 
THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT DEMANDS THAT EVERYBODY IS IN GOOD SHAPE 
WE DON'T WANT OVERLY THIN GIRLS 
AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST GIRLS GO ON CRASH DIETS 
WE TRY TO POINT OUT THAT JUST DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE YOU'LL JUST PUT THE WEIGHT STRAIGHT BACK ON AGAIN 
IT IS ABOUT CHANGING YOUR EATING HABITS AND BECOMING HEALTHIER 
SO I HOPE THE ADVICE THAT NICKY AND I GIVE HAS A GOOD EFFECT ON THEM 
NEXT DAY IN LIVERPOOL TWO OF SAM BOND'S MOST SUCCESSFUL MODELS ARE ENJOYING SOME RETAIL THERAPY 
START ME UP AND WATCH ME GO 
LOOK AT THIS ONE OH I LOVE THAT BAG 
TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD AMANDA MET TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD KATIE ON THE MODELLING SOCIAL CIRCUIT 
THEY'RE BOTH WELL KNOWN IN LIVERPOOL 
HOW ARE YOU ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
I'M VERY WELL THANK YOU 
THEY'RE GORGEOUS THEY'RE NICE 
WHERE ARE THEY AREN'T THEY LOVELY 
THE GIRLS ARE MORE THAN AWARE THAT MAINTAINING A CERTAIN IMAGE IS VITAL TO THEIR SUCCESS AS MODELS 
IT'S STELLA MCCARTNEY I LIKE THEM ONES 
I'M ALWAYS DRESSED AS I AM TODAY LIKE THIS REALLY 
SOME PEOPLE CALL ME OVERDRESSED BUT I'M ALWAYS DRESSED LIKE THAT 
WHEN I GO OUT I LIKE TO GET DRESSED UP ALL MY HAIR AND MAKE UP 
WHAT COULD YOU WEAR IT WITH THEN 
BUT SHE'S NOT LIKE THAT ARE YOU WE'RE TOTALLY THE OPPOSITE REALLY AREN'T WE YEAH WE ARE 
BUT THAT'S WHAT I KIND OF LIKE 
WE'RE LIKE TALKING BUT IT'S DEAD FUNNY COS WE JUST GET ON DON'T WE 
LAST WEEK TOPLESS MODEL KATIE DOWNES WAS OUT IN TENERIFE FOR A PAGE THREE ASSIGNMENT 
LINGERIE MODEL AMANDA HAS SO FAR REFUSED TO GO TOPLESS 
AT LEAST THEIR FRIENDSHIP MIGHT HELP BRIDGE THE LINGERIE TOPLESS DIVIDE 
OH MY GOD A LITTLE PARKA COAT FOR THE DOG 
THAT IS LOVELY ISN'T IT 
DON'T YOU LIKE THAT NO 
OH MY GOD THAT IS PROPER YOU THAT IT'S PROPER ME YOU CHEEKY COW 
THAT SO FUNNY SHE TAKES MADE TO ALL THE PLACES WITH BANDS THERE ARE ALL GRUNGY TYPE PEOPLE WITH LONG HAIR 
I APPRECIATE ALL THAT BUT IT'S NOT MY SCENE AND I'M STANDING THERE ALL DRESSED UP TO THE NINES 
LIKE THAT BIG LIPS ON TOOTHPICKS 
NEITHER GIRL COMMANDS JORDAN LIKE MODELLING FEES SO SHOPPING IN 
A WAG BOUTIQUE LIKE THIS ONE CAN MAKE A HUGE DENT IN THEIR EARNINGS BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE 
LIKE BECAUSE YOU'RE A MODEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK NICE 
IT'S ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK SO YOU PROBABLY DO SHOP A BIT MORE THAN YOUR AVERAGE WOMAN 
SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT IF I LOOK ROUGH THEN EVERYONE'S GOING TO GO 
OOH SHE'S NOT EVEN NICE IN REAL LIFE 
IF YOU WERE JUST AN EVERYDAY PERSON THEY WOULDN'T CARE LESS 
BUT IF YOU LOOK ROUGH THEN EVERYONE WILL SAY SHE LOOKED ROUGH 
THE AVERAGE GLAMOUR MODEL EARNS AROUND THE SAME AS A TRAINEE NURSE 
BUT FOR SOME VERY FEW LUCKY GIRLS IT'S POSSIBLE TO EARN 
SIX FIGURE SALARIES SOMETIMES JUST FOR ONE COVER SHOOT 
I'LL BE RUNNING CIRCLES AROUND YOU 
SMELLS GORGEOUS THAT LET'S SMELL IT M. M. M. 
IN LONDON SAM'S TAKEN CONTROL OF NEW RECRUIT AMY DIAMOND THE DANCER WHO WAS DISCOVERED ON THE TUBE 
SHE'S BACK IN THE CAPITAL FOR A MAKEOVER 
SORRY I WAS JUST TALKING TO THE GIRLS TONY 
SAM IMMEDIATELY SAW POTENTIAL IN AMY EXCEPT FOR THE HOME DYED HAIR THAT IS 
I CAN SEE ONE LITTLE PROBLEM AREA WHICH I KNOW SAMANTHA WILL HAVE SEEN 
YES THE HAIR IS LETTING YOU DOWN 
IT'S JUST OVER BLEACHED 
SAM RARELY ACCOMPANIES A NEW GIRL TO THE SALON BUT FOR AMY SHE'S MADE AN EXCEPTION 
IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN WE SORT OF LIKE SEND GIRLS OFF TO HAIRDRESSERS 
AND I THINK WHY WE DID IN AMY'S CASE 
BECAUSE SHE'S GOT A LOOK WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR AT THE MOMENT 
AND SHE'S NICE AND TALL AND WE WANTED TO GET THE BALL ROLLING REALLY 
O. K. WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS DO SOMETHING TO MAKE IT LOOK SOFTER 
THEN WE MIGHT JUST DO YOUR HAIRLINE SO WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR PHOTOSHOOTS 
SO YOU DON'T SEE SO MUCH OF THE REGROWTH 
THE CHOICE OF WHAT KIND OF BLONDE AMY SHOULD BE IS VITAL 
IT'S A GOLDEN ASH BLONDE ALL RIGHT 
THAT'S GOLDEN ASH 
I KNOW WHAT IT IS I JUST SAID THAT 
HAIRDRESSER GARY AND SAM DECIDE ON A STYLE FOR AMY HOPEFULLY SHE'LL LIKE IT TOO 
HAVE YOU DISCUSSED WITH HER WHAT SORT OF STYLE 
ALSO THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE SEE HOW YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE 
BECAUSE THE MINUTE YOU SAY CUT IT I'M JUST GOING TO CUT IT DOWN 
I'M ONLY KIDDING BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO GIVE HER A SAY IN IT AS WELL 
SHE HAS TO HAVE A SAY IN IT IT'S HER HAIR I KNOW 
I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND MOST OF IT SO I'M JUST GOING TO 
GO ALONG WITH IT AND HOPE THE END RESULT'S O. K. 
I'M JUST HAVING WHITE STUFF PAINTED ONTO MY HAIR AT THE MINUTE 
BUT HOPEFULLY IT'S GOING TO LOOK REALLY NICE AT THE END 
I LOOK LIKE AN ALIEN NOW 
NOT VERY GLAMOUR MODEL AT THE MINUTE IS IT 
WITH ME TIN FOIL IN 
PROFESSIONAL STYLING IS EXPENSIVE BUT SAM HAS PULLED STRINGS TO GET THIS FOR FREE 
IF AMY WANTS TO KEEP THIS GLAMOUR LOOK SHE NEEDS TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HER HAIR 
SO WHEN YOU COME TO ME WITH HAIR LIKE THAT I HAVE TO CONSIDER THE CONDITION YOUR HAIR IS IN 
I HAVE TO CONSIDER YOUR JOB AND I HAVE TO 
SO FOR ME I'D SUGGEST NOT TO USE HOME COLOURS STAY AWAY AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN 
NOTHING LIKE A FOUR HUNDRED PAIR OF JEANS SEVEN HUNDRED ON YOUR JACKET 
FIVE HUNDRED ON A PAIR OF SHOES AND TEN ON YOUR HAIR 
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT 
I DON'T THINK IT WAS AS BAD AS HE SAID 
WELL IT IS AS BAD AS I SAID YES DEFINITELY 
I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THE HAIR AND THE WAY IT'S BEING TREATED 
JUST TAKING THE WEIGHT OFF THE CENTRE 
JUST MAKE SURE THAT SIDE 
I THINK IT LOOKS REALLY REALLY NICE 
IT LOOKS A LOT MORE NATURAL THAN IT DID BEFORE 
I'LL BE ABLE TO CUT MY OWN HAIR NOW AFTER WATCHING YOU 
NEXT TIME I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE SCISSORS TO CUT HER HAIR AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU NOT TO CUT HAIR 
YOU KNOW WHAT A NIGHTMARE I AM AFTER AN HOUR GARY REVEALS AMY'S NEW LOOK 
HOW'S THAT GOOD THAT'S BRILLIANT 
DO YOU LIKE IT IT'S LOVELY 
IT GIVES YOU BOUNCE 
THE COLOUR IS FANTASTIC 
A LOT SOFTER BLONDE 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT YEAH IT'S LOVELY A LOT MORE NATURAL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK YEP 
I THINK IT LOOKS BRILLIANT LOVE IT YEAH 
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 
AMY IS NOW THE PROUD OWNER OF A BOB THAT LOOKS LIKE 
WELL A SAM BOND BOB 
ACROSS TOWN CHRISSY HAS COME UP WITH A SHORTLIST OF GIRLS FOR THE JANET REGER CASTING 
CHRISSY'S BRIEF WAS TO PROVIDE SILICONE FREE B. CUP MODELS 
SO WHAT'S YOUR SIZE D. D. 
WHAT SHE HAS ARE MAINLY D. CUP MODELS TWO OF WHOM HAVE HAD BOOB JOBS 
IT'S BEEN A REAL STRUGGLE TO FIND SMALLER GLAMOUR GIRLS FOR THE JOB 
I DON'T THINK IT WENT VERY WELL 
BECAUSE THE UNDERWEAR'S NOT REALLY FITTED TO MY FIGURE 
THE CASTING DOESN'T GET OFF TO A GREAT START 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I DON'T LIKE HER BOOBS 
SHE'S A THIRTY TWO D. THIRTY OR THIRTY TWO D. 
EVERY GIRL CHRISSY HAS BOOKED HAS A BUST MEASUREMENT TWO SIZES TOO BIG 
THE NEXT MODEL UP IS A SLIMMED DOWN JENNA 
SHE NORMALLY DOES PAGE THREE WORK BUT EVEN SHE MIGHT NOT BE SMALL ENOUGH 
I DIDN'T REALISE THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES 
ONE IS MORE RAUNCHY THE OTHER ONE'S NOT SO RAUNCHY 
BUT I DON'T MIND WHICH ONE I DO 
THE RAUNCHIER THE BETTER 
SO I'M JUST GOING TO TRY THESE ON 
TOP HALF TOWARDS ME A TINY BIT MORE GOOD 
WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING FROM THE GIRLS WE'RE GETTING IN NOT A LOT 
I THINK THAT WENT O. K. THEY'RE GOOD MODELS GLAMOUR MODELS 
GLAMOUR MODELS THEY'RE NOT I THINK YOU NEED MORE OF A FASHION BASED MODEL 
YEAH WHICH COSTS TEN THOUSAND WHICH COSTS A LOT MORE MONEY YES 
IS THAT SMALL DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY ON ANOTHER ONE IT DOESN'T FIT 
MODEL AFTER MODEL WRESTLES WITH THE SAMPLE SIZE B. CUP LINGERIE 
I'M STRUGGLING 
TOPLESS LADS MAGAZINE PERFECT 
NOT FOR WHAT WE NEED I'M AFRAID 
NEXT UP IS TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD LOUISE GLOVER 
HER MODELLING JOBS HAVE BEEN SPARSE AND ONLY LAST WEEK SHE WAS READY TO QUIT FOR GOOD 
AND NOW I'M THINKING IS MY DAYS OVER WITH GLAMOUR 
IF WE CANNOT GET YOU IN THOSE MAGAZINES WE HAVE TO TRY DIFFERENT AREAS 
JUST KEEP THE FAITH O. K. 
O. K. 
LOUISE DID KEEP THE FAITH AND THE AGENCY PUT HER FORWARD FOR THIS JOB 
SO IS THIS PART OF A SHOOT OR HOLIDAY OR TESTS 
PORTFOLIO SHOOT 
YEAH VERY PRETTY 
UNFORTUNATELY LOUISE IS ANOTHER MODEL WHO HAS BREAST IMPLANTS 
SO HOW MANY OPERATIONS HAVE YOU HAD FOUR 
FOUR SO YOU'VE HAD ENLARGING AND THEN REDUCING YES 
I THINK SHE'LL DO WELL SHE'S GOT A GREAT BODY 
CAN YOU JUST TURN SIDE ON JUST A BIT MORE THAT WAY 
THAT'S IT YEP GOOD GOOD 
THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON THIS JOB AND LOUISE IS FINDING IT HARD TO RELAX 
JUST A BIT CONSCIOUS THAT'S ALL 
HAVE I PHOTOGRAPHED HER WRONG YES THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU 
SHE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS SHE LOOKS LIKE A BODYBUILDER 
I THINK THEY'RE ALL AWFUL YEAH I AGREE 
BEFORE SHE GOES LOUISE IS EAGER TO GET SOME FEEDBACK 
NOT NAUGHTY BUT JANET REGER WILL SEE I THINK I WAS TOO CONSCIOUS AS WELL 
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF ME IN THE NORMAL CLOTHES THE NORMAL RANGE 
GOOD YOU'RE VERY TONED THOUGH 
TOO TONED NO YOU'RE TOO TONED 
TOO TONED FOR YOUR RANGE YEAH FOR MY RANGE 
SO I'VE NOT GOT THE JOB THEN OH ALL RIGHT THEN 
I NEED TO GO THROUGH THE PICTURES AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW THROUGH CHRISSY THAT'S HOW YEAH 
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO CHOOSE PAGE THREE GIRLS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT THE RIGHT BOOBS FOR IT A SOFTER BODY 
NO I DISAGREE NOT NECESSARILY 
THANK YOU BYE 
CHEERS BYE 
SHE'S TOO TONED AND SHE'S SHORT 
AND HER BREASTS ARE TOO 
BUT SHE KNOWS THAT SHE'S GONE SMALLER YEAH 
SO IF SHE WANTS A JANET REGER SHOOT SHE'LL HAVE TO MAKE THEM SMALLER AGAIN 
AFTER LOUISE THE DAY DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER 
SHE'S TOO BIG SHE'S TOO BIG 
IT'S A WASTE OF EVERYONE'S TIME REALLY 
BACK IN LIVERPOOL AMANDA AND KATIE ROUND OFF A DAY'S SHOPPING AT ONE OF THE CITY'S TRENDY BARS 
I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT DO YOU DO 
BECAUSE I ALWAYS FEEL ASHAMED SAYING I'M A MODEL 
THEY MUST LOOK AT ME AND THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TWO FOOT TALL HOW CAN YOU BE A MODEL 
AND I FEEL DEAD EMBARRASSED 
I HATE SAYING IT THOUGH AS WELL I JUST THINK I'M NOT LIKE A DEAD GLAMMY PERSON ANYWAY 
SO THEY'LL PROBABLY LOOK AT ME AND THINK HOW CAN YOU BE A MODEL 
LIKE IF YOU GO TO LONDON MY EYES WERE OPENED I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW PEOPLE THE GIRLS ACT 
TO BE HONEST I THINK THEY ACTED LIKE SLAGS DOWN THERE MOST OF THEM 
IN THE PARTIES I'VE GONE TO THE GIRLS THE WAY THEY ACT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT 
GIRLS JUST DON'T DO IT IN LIVERPOOL ANYWHERE I'VE EVER BEEN OR GONE 
LUCKILY FOR AMANDA SHE WON'T HAVE TO VISIT LONDON ANY TIME SOON 
SHE'S MAKING AMBITIOUS PLANS TO LAUNCH A CAREER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC 
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MIAMI 
A LONG TIME AGO I GOT ASKED TO BE REPRESENTED 
BY THIS AGENCY IN MIAMI CALLED ICONIC GLOBAL MANAGEMENT 
THEY WANTED ME TO STAY OVER THERE FOR A MONTH 
AND YOU KNOW LIKE SET ME UP TO GO AND SEE ALL THE MAGAZINES AND LINED ME SOME WORK UP 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING FOR ME 
SOUND ISN'T IT YOU MAY AS WELL GO AND DO IT THEN 
I'M GOING TO GO TO L. A. AND TRY AND JOIN WITH A FEW PEOPLE YEAH 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT I'LL BE GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM HERE TO BE HONEST 
I DON'T THINK I'M GETTING ANY FURTHER IN MY CAREER BECAUSE I DON'T DO TOPLESS 
I DON'T THINK I'M GETTING ANY FURTHER IN ENGLAND 
ACROSS TOWN AMANDA'S SIX YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SAVANNAH AND HER FRIEND ARE HAVING TEA AT HER GRANDMA'S 
AMANDA'S AWAY A LOT AND HER MUM TAKES ON MUCH OF THE CHILDCARE 
I THINK WITH AMANDA HAVING ME AND MY MUM AS WELL 
AND KEITH'S MUM IS VERY GOOD WITH SAVANNAH AS WELL SO WE ALL SORT OF SHARE HER 
AMANDA FEELS THAT HER DECISION NOT TO GO TOPLESS 
HAS LIMITED HER CHANCES OF GREATER SUCCESS IN THE U. K. 
SHE FEELS SHE HAS NO OPTION BUT TO TRY AND MAKE IT IN AMERICA 
SHE LIKES THE CAMERA BUT SHE JUST WILL NOT DO TOPLESS 
SHE'S NEVER BEEN THAT SORT OF GIRL TO WALK AROUND LIKE THAT ANYWAY 
SHE JUST WON'T DO IT 
I THINK AS WELL NOW BECAUSE SHE'S OLDER AND SHE'S GOT A DAUGHTER 
SAVANNAH IS COMING AT THAT AGE AND SHE SEES AMANDA IN THE MAGAZINES 
AND SHE ALWAYS SAYS THE ONES I LIKE THAT ONE MUMMY 
BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE BECAUSE YOUR TOP'S TOO LOW THERE 
SO I THINK SHE FEELS A LITTLE BIT STRANGE WHEN SAVANNAH SAYS THAT 
I DON'T KNOW BUT I JUST DON'T THINK SHE'LL DO IT 
AMANDA HAS HAD TOPLESS TEST PICTURES TAKEN 
BUT HAS ALWAYS REFUSED TO HAVE THEM PUBLISHED 
I'D JUST WAIT FOR THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY TO DO TOPLESS 
IF LIKE IN THE END YOU DO WANT TO DO IT 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED I GOT OFFERED TO DO PLAYBOY CENTREFOLD 
AND I TURNED IT DOWN BECAUSE I THOUGHT IN THE FUTURE 
I WANT TO IT WHEN I GET A LOT MORE KNOWN AND MY NAME IS OUT THERE MORE 
I JUST THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU CAN'T REALLY BEAT PLAYBOY CAN YOU 
SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT GETTING MY BOOBS OUT FOR THAT I WOULD DEFINITELY DO IT 
BUT I DON'T KNOW I'VE DONE IT NOW AND IT'S DONE 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WASN'T EVEN WHAT DID YOU DO CENTREFOLD 
NO I TESTED FOR PLAYMATE 
YOU GET TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO THAT'S WHAT JORDAN DID 
THE BEST ONE TO DO IS CENTREFOLD 
NO THE BEST ONE IS PLAYMATE 
IT'S CENTREFOLD CENTREFOLD IS JUST ONE PHOTOSHOOT PLAYMATE BUT CENTREFOLD IS THE MAIN ONE 
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WITH PLAYMATE A CENTREFOLD OH IS IT 
THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE ASKED ME TO DO BE A PLAYMATE 
WHEN YOU GET CENTREFOLD YOU WORK FOR THEM FOR A YEAR 
YOU DON'T YOU DO LOVE 
DANIELLE LLOYD BUT SHE WAS MISS GREAT BRITAIN 
YEAH THAT'S WHY SHE JUST GOT THE PHOTOSHOOT 
AMANDA AND KATIE MAY BE FRIENDS BUT IN THE WORLD OF GLAMOUR MODELLING THEY'RE ALSO RIVALS 
AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S PLAYBOY IT'S NOT A SHITTY LITTLE MAGAZINE 
I'VE NOT GOT MY TITS OUT IN NUTS AND ALL THAT 
I'VE GOT MY TITS OUT IN PLAYBOY THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH NUTS 
ME PERSONALLY I WOULDN'T GO TOPLESS IN NUTS 
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SPORT WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON I WOULDN'T DO THE SPORT 
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THE SPORT I WASN'T IN THE SPORT 
YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT ME DOWN 
YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT ME DOWN BECAUSE I'VE DONE NUTS TOPLESS IN NUTS 
AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU WOULDN'T DO NUTS I'M NOT PUTTING NUTS DOWN I LIKE NUTS THE MAGAZINE 
NUTS IS THE FIRST MAGAZINE THAT LIKE PUBLISHED MY PICTURES 
I'M NOT SLAGGING NUTS OFF OR ZOO 
I'M JUST SAYING I'D JUST RATHER THE FIRST TOPLESS PICTURES TO BE IN SOMETHING LIKE PLAYBOY 
OH WELL 
SOMETIMES GLAMOUR GIRLS JUST HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE 
THANKS TA RA 
BACK IN LONDON AT THE JANET REGER CASTING THERE'S ONE GIRL LEFT TO SEE 
TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD BIANCA DEACY IMMEDIATELY HAS ONE ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER GIRLS 
ANY TATTOOS NO 
THE LAST ONE I GOT HAD FIVE AND I DIDN'T SEE THEM REALLY 
AND A BIT OF A SMILE LAST ONE 
I THINK THEY LIKE BIANCA 
AFTER A PARADE OF UNSUITABLE MODELS BOOB JOBS AND TATTOOS 
IT LOOKS LIKE SAM BOND GIRL BIANCA 
MIGHT HAVE JUST WHAT IT TAKES TO BE THE FACE OF JANET REGER 
I THINK IT WENT RATHER WELL 
AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR CHRISSY MANAGED TO PULL IT OUT OF THE BAG 
NEXT TIME ON GLAMOUR GIRLS 
DO YOU NEED TO ZOOM IN AMY 
I DON'T KNOW 
AMY DIAMOND EXPERIENCES SOME TECHNICAL PROBLEMS ON HER FIRST PHOTOSHOOT 
HANG ON LET ME GET THE GIRLS OUT 
COMEBACK KID ANNA TAVERNER DISCOVERS HOW MUCH THE INDUSTRY HAS CHANGED 
IF SOMEONE HAD SAGGY BOOBS THEY'D SELLOTAPE THEM UP 
THERE WAS NO RETOUCHING AT ALL 
AND AMANDA HARRINGTON GETS A TASTE OF GLAMOUR AMERICAN STYLE 
I'VE GOT TO GET MY MAKE UP DONE IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR 
HER MIAMI TRIP DOESN'T GET OFF TO THE BEST OF STARTS 
IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT
