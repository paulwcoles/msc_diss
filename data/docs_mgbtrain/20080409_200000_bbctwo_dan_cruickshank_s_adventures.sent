I'M ON A JOURNEY TO EXPLORE THE ARCHITECTURE OF DEATH 
THE BOHEMIAN CHAPEL WHERE HUMAN BONES ARE MADE INTO WORKS OF ART 
AN ITALIAN CEMETERY WHERE DEATH IS A SENSUAL EXPERIENCE 
AN INDIAN CITY WHERE YOU COME TO DIE 
AN EGYPTIAN TEMPLE TO IMMORTALISE THE SOUL OF A PHARAOH 
AND MAYAN PYRAMIDS FOR HUMAN SACRIFICE 
THE SACRED RIVER NILE IN EGYPT 
I'M CROSSING THE RIVER NILE AT LUXOR MOVING FROM THE LAND OF THE LIVING ON THE EAST BANK 
WHERE LIFE IS PROCLAIMED EACH MORNING WITH THE RISING SUN 
TO THE LAND OF THE DEAD ON THE WEST BANK WHERE THE SUN SETS 
AND WHERE THE DEAD WERE COMMEMORATED WERE SUSTAINED BY AWE INSPIRING ARCHITECTURE 
ARCHITECTURE INTENDED TO LAST FOR ETERNITY 
I'VE COME HERE TO SEE A WOMAN WHO'S ALWAYS INTRIGUED ME 
A WOMAN WHO DIED NEARLY THREE AND A HALF THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
HER NAME IS HATSHEPSUT AND FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SHE RULED EGYPT AS A MAN AS A PHARAOH 
THIS IS HATSHEPSUT'S TOMB 
A STRANGELY NEGLECTED AND CRUMBLING PLACE 
NEVER OPEN TO THE PUBLIC 
GOLLY THIS IS A CHALLENGE 
THE SHAFT STINKS OF AMMONIA BATS I SUPPOSE 
AND I MUSTN'T TOUCH THE SIDES IN CASE I BRING THE WHOLE THING DOWN 
THIS FLAKING LIMESTONE 
THIS SHAFT'S BEEN DESCENDING RATHER STEEPLY FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED METRES 
AND NOW I HAVE TO GET ON MY HANDS AND KNEES 
TO GET BELOW THE LINTEL HERE ALL CUT FROM THE LIMESTONE 
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A TOMB LIKE THIS IN EGYPT BEFORE 
IT'S ROUGH IT'S TREACHEROUS 
AH AT LAST 
WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR 
THE BURIAL CHAMBER 
IT'S VERY ROUGH 
NO SIGN OF PLASTER OR PAINTINGS 
THERE'S NO BODY OF HATSHEPSUT DOWN HERE 
BUT NEVER MIND I'LL LOOK FOR HER SOMEWHERE ELSE 
THIS IS HATSHEPSUT'S MAGNIFICENT MORTUARY TEMPLE 
NOT A TOMB BUT A PALACE TO HOUSE HER SPIRIT AND SOUL 
MORTUARY TEMPLES WERE A MEANS OF OBTAINING IMMORTALITY 
WHERE THE LIVING MADE OFFERINGS TO THE DEAD 
TO SUSTAIN THEM IN THE UNDERWORLD 
TEMPLES WERE CALLED THE HOUSES OF THE MILLIONS OF YEARS 
THIS TEMPLE IS ARCHITECTURALLY STUNNING 
IT SEEMS IN ITS SYMMETRY AND ITS POWERFUL SIMPLICITY 
TO REPRESENT MAAT THAT IS THE EGYPTIAN IDEA OF TRUTH AND ORDER 
MAAT PREVAILING OVER CHAOS REPRESENTED BY THE ROUGH RUDE CLIFF FACE BEHIND 
AN INCREDIBLE PIECE OF WORK 
AND IMAGINE IN THE PAST ALL YOU COULD SEE APPROACHING FROM AFAR 
THESE ROWS OF STATUES OF OSIRIS THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD 
THE IMAGES ON THESE WALLS PROCLAIM THAT HATSHEPSUT 
NOT ONLY HAD A PHARAOH AS A FATHER AND AS A HUSBAND 
BUT THAT SHE WAS THE CHILD OF A GOD AMUN RA 
THE STORY IS THAT AMUN RA CREPT INTO THE BED CHAMBER OF HATSHEPSUT'S MOTHER AHMOSE 
THE MOTHER WOKE UP AND SMELT INCENSE THE SIGN OF THE PRESENCE OF A GOD AND LAUGHED IN PLEASURE 
AND HERE IT SAYS THAT THE GOD DID WITH HER AS HE LIKED 
AND HERE YOU SEE THE MOTHER PREGNANT A LOVELY IMAGE 
A LITTLE TUMMY AND GAVE BIRTH TO HATSHEPSUT 
SO HATSHEPSUT HAD A DIVINE ORIGIN AND THAT GAVE HER THE RIGHT TO RULE AS A PHARAOH OF EGYPT 
THESE WALLS RECORD WHAT HATSHEPSUT REGARDED AS HER GREATEST WORLDLY ACHIEVEMENT 
A TRADE MISSION TO THE EXOTIC LAND OF PUNT 
NO ONE QUITE KNOWS WHERE PUNT WAS 
PROBABLY IN MODERN SOMALIA OR ETHIOPIA 
BUT CERTAINLY IT WAS STRANGE ENOUGH FOR THE EGYPTIANS TO RECORD PUNT'S EVERYDAY ARCHITECTURE 
HERE WE SEE IT A LITTLE HUTS ON STICKS APPROACHED WITH LADDERS 
PALM TREES EVERYWHERE 
BUT WHAT SHE REALLY WANTED WAS INCENSE INCENSE TO NOURISH THE GODS THE FOOD OF THE GODS 
AND HERE WE SEE EGYPTIANS CARRYING INCENSE TREES MYRRH TREES 
WHOLE TREES IN BASKETS 
WITH THE ROOTS BEING CARRIED ONTO SHIPS TO BE BROUGHT BACK HERE 
WHAT SHE WANTED WAS TO PLANT THESE TREES AT THIS TEMPLE 
TO PLEASE HER DIVINE FATHER AMUN RA 
THE BUILDING WAS ONCE RICH IN IMAGES OF HATSHEPSUT 
SHE WOULD'VE BEEN A STRINKING PRESENCE 
THE QUEEN WAS ALWAYS DEPICTED AS A MAN WITH A CEREMONIAL BEARD 
BUT MOST OF THESE IMAGES WERE AGGRESSIVELY ERASED BY HER RIVAL FOR POWER THUTMOSIS THE THIRD 
THE TEMPLE IS MADE UP OF LOWER AND UPPER TERRACES 
CONNECTED BY GIANT RAMPS 
EACH LEVEL BECOMING MORE SACRED AS YOU ASCEND 
THIS IS HATSHEPSUT'S CHAPEL WITHIN HER MORTUARY TEMPLE 
HERE PRIESTS WOULD HAVE COME TO MAKE OFFERINGS TO SUSTAIN HER SOUL IN THE UNDERWORLD 
AND HERE YOU SEE RANKS AND RANKS OF PRIESTS MAKING OFFERINGS 
MARCHING FORWARD CARRYING FOWLS AND FRUITS I THINK AND LIQUIDS 
ALL GOING I SUPPOSE TOWARDS WHERE HER IMAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
NOW GONE WHAT DOES SURVIVE IS THIS WONDERFUL THING 
THIS FALSE DOOR THAT ALLOWED HER SPIRIT AND SOUL TO TRAVEL BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT 
TO ENTER HER TEMPLE AND LEAVE IT FOR THE UNDERWORLD 
WHAT IS STRIKING THOUGH IS THAT ALL THE IMAGES OF HATSHEPSUT 
AND HER CARTOUCHE HER NAME THEY'VE BEEN REMOVED BRUTALLY CUT AWAY 
THAT IS A FRIGHTFUL FATE 
SHE HAS BEEN I SUPPOSE CONSIGNED TO OBLIVION 
HER NAME REMOVED FROM MEMORY 
THE INTENTION IS THAT THAT WOULD GIVE HER A SECOND PERMANENT DEATH 
THE ROUTE THROUGH THE BUILDING ENDS BY TAKING ME INTO THE MOUNTAIN ITSELF 
THIS IS THE SACRED EPICENTRE OF THE TEMPLE 
ONLY THE HIGHEST IN THE LAND COULD ENTER HERE 
IT'S THE SANCTUARY OF AMUN RA 
WHO WAS HATSHEPSUT'S DIVINE FATHER THE GREAT GOD OF THEBES 
THE SANCTUARY IS CUT INTO THE MOUNTAINSIDE 
OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT DEFINES THE VALLEY OF THE KINGS 
THE TOMBS LIE JUST OVER THERE 
NOW I'M GOING INTO THE INNER PARTS OF THE SANCTUARY 
IT GETS SMALLER DARKER MORE INTIMATE MORE HOLY 
ONLY THE HIGH PRIESTS AND THE PHARAOH I GUESS COULD PENETRATE THIS FAR 
AND HERE IS SOMETHING I'VE DREAMED OF FINDING 
IT'S INCREDIBLE 
HERE IS AN IMAGE OF HATSHEPSUT NOT DESTROYED BY THUTMOSIS 
HATSHEPSUT OF COURSE IN THE IMAGE OF A POWERFUL MAN 
I KNOW IT'S HER BECAUSE HER CARTOUCHE HER NAME SURVIVES 
HERE IT IS 
IT DOESN'T SAY HATSHEPSUT BUT IT'S HER BIRTH NAME 
MAAT KA RA 
THERE IT IS 
HER FANTASTIC IMAGE 
HATSHEPSUT WANTED TO OBTAIN IMMORTALITY THROUGH ARCHITECTURE 
THROUGH ART AND DESPITE ALL THE ATTACKS UPON HER 
HER TEMPLE AND THIS IMAGE OF HER HER NAME HERE SURVIVES 
SO SHE'S NOT CONSIGNED TO MEMORY OBLITERATED SHE LIVES 
I CAN UTTER HER NAME HATSHEPSUT 
WONDERFUL TO SEE HER 
AND IF HER SOUL IS STILL ALIVE THEN IT MUST NEED NOURISHMENT OFFERINGS 
AFTER ALL THESE CENTURIES SHE MUST BE STARVING 
SO I WANT TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE GAVE HER DIVINE FATHER AMUN RA 
MAGICAL MYRRH FROM THE LAND OF PUNT 
HERE IT IS 
INCENSE THAT FEEDS THE SOUL 
THAT PURIFIES 
AND I HOPE THIS REACHES HER IN THE OTHER WORLD 
KUTNA HORA ONE OF THE RICHEST CITIES OF OLD BOHEMIA 
NOW IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
FROM THE MIDDLE AGES ONWARDS THE CITY POURED MONEY INTO FANTASTIC RELIGIOUS ARCHITECTURE 
CELEBRATING IN STONE THE TRIUMPH OF RESURRECTION OVER DEATH 
BUT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF KUTNA HORA 
IS A CHAPEL WHERE ACTUAL HUMAN REMAINS 
HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO ART AND ARCHITECTURE 
IN THE HEART OF BOHEMIA IS AN ASTONISHING AND ARCHITECTURALLY EVOCATIVE SHRINE 
THAT REVEALS MUCH ABOUT WESTERN CHRISTIAN ATTITUDES TO DEATH AND BURIAL 
JUST THREE MILES FROM THE CENTRE OF KUTNA HORA IS THE TOWN OF SEDLEC 
WHERE THE HUMAN BODY HAS BEEN ELEVATED INTO AN ALTARPIECE 
CHRISTIANS OF COURSE BELIEVE THAT WE HUMANS ARE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD 
THE BODY IS SACRED IT'S A TEMPLE AND MUST BE TREATED WITH GREAT RESPECT AFTER DEATH 
ALSO OF COURSE CHRISTIANS BELIEVE IN RESURRECTION 
WHERE CHRIST ROSE AFTER THREE DAYS 
WE ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT WILL RISE TO BE JUDGED 
AND I'M GOING TO A PLACE NOW 
WHERE THE CHRISTIAN PRESERVATION OF THE BODY 
HAS REACHED BIZARRE EXTREMES 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES SEDLEC POSSESSED ONE OF CENTRAL EUROPE'S MOST POPULAR BURIAL GROUNDS 
IT CONTAINED SOIL BROUGHT FROM JERUSALEM MAKING THIS HOLY LAND 
GRAVES WOULD BE CLEARED AND THE REMAINS HOUSED IN THIS OSSUARY 
A CHAPEL FOR BONES' 
THIS IS THE REALM OF DEATH 
HERE THE EARTHLY REMAINS OF THE DEAD WERE GATHERED TOGETHER 
TO AWAIT THE LAST JUDGEMENT TO AWAIT RESURRECTION 
THIS IS THE UNDERWORLD 
THIS GRISLY SPECTACLE REMINDED THE LIVING OF THEIR INEVITABLE DEATH 
WHEN THEY WOULD BE JUDGED FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN LIFE 
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THESE BELL SHAPES WERE CREATED 
SYMBOLISING THE BELLS THAT WOULD TOLL ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT 
THESE ARE THE BONES OF PEOPLE WHO DIED BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
I CAN'T RESIST PICKING UP THIS SKULL 
GOLLY I WONDER WHO THIS PERSON WAS HOW THEY DIED WHEN EXACTLY 
IT'S INCREDIBLE ONE FEELS SO STRANGELY INTIMATE WITH THESE PEOPLE 
WHEN ONE HANDLES THEIR EARTHLY REMAINS 
BUT IT WAS IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THAT THE CHRISTIAN FASCINATION WITH THE DEAD BODY 
FOUND ITS ULTIMATE EXPRESSION 
THE CHAPEL HAD BEEN ACQUIRED BY A RICH FAMILY THE SCHWARZENBERGS' 
THEY EMPLOYED A WOODCARVER TO CLEAN UP THE OSSUARY 
AND THE RESULTS ARE EXTRAORDINARY 
AND HERE'S THE SCHWARZENBERG COAT OF ARMS 
VARIED HERALDIC DEVICES MADE FROM DIFFERENT BONES 
HERE IS A BIRD PECKING OUT THE EYE OF A MUSLIM TURK 
HIS HAIR REPRESENTED BY RIB BONES 
ALL VERY MACABRE 
THE DISPLAY IN THIS OSSUARY MIGHT SEEM GROTESQUE 
BUT THESE BONES FASHIONED INTO ORNAMENTS 
OCCUPY SACRED GROUND AND CELEBRATE THE WONDER OF GOD'S CREATION 
IN THE CENTRE OF THE OSSUARY HANGS THIS RATHER MONSTROUS CHANDELIER 
A SPECIMEN OF EVERY BONE IN THE HUMAN BODY IS USED IN ITS CONSTRUCTION INCREDIBLE 
I CAN SPOT VERTEBRAE THERE 
BASE OF SPINE 
AND UP THERE JAWBONES 
ALL THIS HANGS FROM A FESTOON OF SKULL AND CROSSBONES 
BUT WITH ANY DELICATE DECORATION THERE'S ALWAYS THE PROBLEM OF KEEPING IT CLEAN 
IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE AROUND FORTY THOUSAND SKELETONS IN THE OSSUARY 
ONE MAN HAS BEEN TENDING THESE BONES FOR FIFTEEN YEARS' 
DOES IT FEEL LIKE LIVING WITH THE DEAD 
WORKING DAY AFTER DAY WITH THE MORTAL REMAINS OF THOUSANDS OF HUMAN BEINGS 
THIS UNCANNY PLACE IS A REMINDER OF A TIME IN THE CHRISTIAN WEST 
WHEN DEATH WAS PART OF LIFE AND THE LIVING LEARNED FROM THE DEAD 
THIS IS GUATEMALA 
ONCE A LAND OF THE MAYA AN ANCIENT CIVILISATION 
WHOSE INFLUENCE CAN STILL BE FELT IN THIS LAND 
I'M ARRIVING ON A DAY WHEN THE SOULS OF THE DEAD 
ARE SAID TO RETURN TO EARTH TO COMMUNE WITH THE LIVING 
THE DAY OF THE DEAD 
ONCE A YEAR THE TINY VILLAGE OF SAN JOSE GATHERS IN ITS CHURCH 
TO VENERATE THREE SKULLS 
SOME SAY THEY BELONGED TO CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES 
OTHERS THAT THEY'RE THE REMAINS OF MAYAN CHIEFS OR HOLY MEN 
THE FESTIVAL IS A STRANGE MARRIAGE OF CATHOLICISM 
IMPOSED BY THE SPANISH CONQUISTADORS AND INDIGENOUS MAYAN BELIEFS' 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DOESN'T RECOGNISE THE FESTIVAL OF THE DAY OF THE DEAD 
AT LEAST OFFICIALLY SO THIS IS A MOST INTRIGUING CHURCH SERVICE 
IT'S HELD ON ALL SAINTS DAY 
SO I SUPPOSE ONE CAN SAY IT'S CELEBRATING THAT BUT I'M NOT SURE 
THE SKULL ITSELF IS A VERY POWERFUL MAYAN SYMBOL 
MAYANS WOULD KEEP THE SKULLS OF THEIR ANCESTORS 
AND ONCE A YEAR PRESENT THEM VENERATE THEM REALLY 
AND PAINT BETWEEN THE EYES WHERE THE CROSS IS PAINTED ON THESE SKULLS 
THEY'D PAINT THE NAME OF THE DEAD PERSON AND THEY'D COLLECT THE SKULLS OF VANQUISHED ENEMIES 
THE SKULL'S A VERY ANCIENT AND IMPORTANT RELIC IMAGE IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD 
AFTER THE SERVICE THERE'S A PROCESSION 
IN WHICH ONE OF THE SKULLS IS TAKEN FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE 
ALL OF IT OH GRACIAS 
THIS IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING 
OVER THERE IS THE OFFERING ALTAR 
BUT AROUND THE SKULL ARE BOWLS OF FOOD AND EVEN A BOTTLE OF BEER 
THEY'RE THERE TO ATTRACT THE SOULS OF THE DEAD ANCESTORS TO NOURISH THEM 
SO ON THAT OFFERING TABLE WE HAVE CHRISTIAN RITUAL 
AND RITUAL OBJECTS OF THE DAY OF THE DEAD COMBINED 
THROUGHOUT THE VILLAGE PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THEIR ANCESTORS TO RETURN 
OH HOLA 
OLD FRIENDS LIVING AND DEAD ARE MEETING AGAIN THIS NIGHT 
IN MOST SOCIETIES DEATH IS FEARED BUT HERE IT SEEMS DEATH IS NOT SO ALARMING 
BECAUSE YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEAD THE DEAD WITH THE LIVING 
THE ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDING THE PROCESSION IS NOT MORBID BUT JOYFUL 
BECAUSE HERE THE SPIRIT OF THE MAYA IS VERY MUCH ALIVE 
BUT TOMORROW I'M GOING TO EXPLORE THE DARKER SIDE OF THE MAYAN CULT OF DEATH 
DEEP IN THE RAINFOREST LIE THE REMAINS OF THE GREAT LOST MAYA CITY OF YAXHA 
DISCOVERED BY THE EXPLORER TEOBERT MALER 
HE WAS A HEADSTRONG CANTANKEROUS FELLOW BUT WITH A LOVE OF THE MAYA 
HE DESCRIBED ARRIVING HERE IN NINETEEN OH FOUR 
HE'D BEEN TRAVELLING FOR SOME TIME AND HIS MEN WERE RATHER RESTLESS 
AND HE WAS ALSO CLEARLY A BIT FED UP BECAUSE HE SAID 
THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AND COULD ONLY THINK OF GUZZLING 
BUT WHAT MALER FOUND SILENCED THEIR GRUMBLING 
YAXHA WAS CONSTRUCTED ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
AND THE TEMPLES ARE VERY PRECISELY BUILT 
EVEN THOUGH THE MAYA DIDN'T HAVE METAL TOOLS OR THE WHEEL 
THESE STEP PYRAMIDS SERVED AS PLATFORMS FOR TEMPLES 
STAIRCASES TO THE GODS' 
THIS WAS A VAST CITY 
BUT NOW ONLY THE ELITE BUILDINGS SURVIVE ABOVE GROUND LEVEL 
THE PALACES THE TEMPLES 
THE MORE HUMBLE BUILDINGS WELL THEY'RE LOST BURIED IN THE RAINFOREST 
THE MAYA WAS A VERY SOPHISTICATED CIVILISATION 
THERE WAS A WRITTEN LANGUAGE THERE WAS MATHEMATICS 
THEY WERE GREAT ASTRONOMERS THEY CHARTED THE MOVEMENTS OF THE PLANETS AND STARS 
TO CREATE A VERY ACCURATE CALENDAR AND ALL OF THIS CIVILISATION 
ALL OF THESE IDEAS LIE HERE LOCKED IN THE BUILDINGS 
THE ANCIENT MAYA SAW THE WORLDS OF THE LIVING AND OF THE DEAD AS ONE AND THE SAME 
EVERYWHERE THERE ARE MONUMENTS TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN THIS LIFE AND THE NEXT 
IN FRONT OF ME ARE THE FRAGMENTARY REMAINS OF AN ALTAR 
AND AROUND ALTARS SUCH AS THIS A RITUAL TOOK PLACE 
THAT WE WOULD FIND ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
HERE THE KING AND QUEEN CAME TO SPILL THEIR OWN BLOOD 
THE QUEEN WOULD TAKE A BIT OF CORD WITH THORNS AND RUN IT THROUGH HER TONGUE 
AND THE BLOOD THAT WOULD EXPLODE OUT SHE'D THROW ON THE IMAGES OF THE GODS STANDING ON THE ALTAR HERE 
THE KING WOULD TAKE HIS PENIS AND RUN A SPINE THROUGH IT 
AND THE BLOOD FROM THAT HE'D THROW ON THE IMAGES OF THE GODS 
FOR MAYANS BLOOD WAS THE MOST PRECIOUS SUBSTANCE 
IT CONTAINED THE SACRED LIFE ESSENCE THEY CALLED KU'UL 
AND ONLY BLOOD COULD NOURISH COULD APPEASE THE GODS 
BUT IT WASN'T JUST THEIR OWN BLOOD THAT WAS SPILLED 
ON THE TOP OF PYRAMIDS LIKE THIS YAXHA'S TALLEST THEY PERFORMED HUMAN SACRIFICE 
THE VICTIM WOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP THE STAIRCASE ON THE FRONT OF THE PYRAMID 
LED TO THE ALTAR THE ALTAR WOULD HAVE HAD A CONVEX TOP 
SO THE VICTIM WOULD HAVE BEEN STRETCHED OVER IT ON THEIR BACK 
WITH THE CHEST STICKING UP 
THEY'D HAVE BEEN HELD DOWN BY FOUR MEN AND A FIFTH MAN WITH A GREAT STONE KNIFE 
WOULD HAVE INSERTED THE KNIFE INTO THE STOMACH JUST BELOW THE CHEST 
RIPPED OPEN THE WOUND AND THRUST A HAND INTO THE CHEST CAVITY 
AND PULLED OUT THE STILL LIVING HEART 
THE HEART PUMPING GUSHES OF PRECIOUS SACRED BLOOD 
THEN THE CORPSE OF THE VICTIM WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD UP 
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PAINTED BLUE THE COLOUR OF SACRIFICE 
AND THIS BODY WOULD HAVE BEEN THROWN DOWN THE STAIRS 
TO THE BASE OF THE PYRAMID 
AND THERE THE VICTIM WOULD HAVE BEEN SKINNED 
AND THE SKIN 
THIS AWFUL LOOKING GARMENT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN WRAPPED ON AND AROUND THE OFFICIATING PRIEST 
AND HE'D HAVE DANCED IN A SOLEMN MANNER DOWN THERE 
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO'D GATHERED TO WATCH THE SACRIFICE 
THE MAYA ARE A PROBLEM A PARADOX 
THEY BELIEVED IN UTTER DESOLATION 
YET THEY BUILT TO LAST FOR ETERNITY 
THEY WERE A VERY SOPHISTICATED CIVILISATION 
YET STEEPED IN BLOOD AND MURDER 
WHAT IS ONE TO MAKE OF THEM 
I SUPPOSE THE OBVIOUS POINT IS THAT FOR THEM 
LIFE WAS NOT HELD CHEAP IT WAS THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THINGS 
AND BLOOD HAD TO BE GIVEN TO THE GODS TO ALLOW THE GODS TO DO THEIR JOB 
WHICH WAS TO ENSURE THAT CREATION WOULD GO ON THAT THE SUN WOULD RISE EACH DAY 
SO REALLY OUT OF LOVE THE MAYA KILLED 
THE MAYA TOOK LIFE TO ENSURE THAT LIFE WOULD CONTINUE 
I'VE COME TO GENOA ON THE ITALIAN RIVIERA 
THE LARGEST PORT IN ALL ITALY 
GENOA'S AN ANCIENT TRADING CITY THAT THROUGH THE CENTURIES SURVIVED MANY TRIBULATIONS 
BUT IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY IT FACED A POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC THREAT 
A THREAT THAT CAME NOT FROM THE LIVING BUT FROM THE DEAD 
THIS IS STAGLIENO CEMETERY A VAST CITY OF THE DEAD 
WITH MONUMENTS CHAPELS STREETS AND A TRIUMPHAL GATEWAY 
IT SAVED THE CITY FROM DISASTER 
GENOA WAS BLIGHTED BY DISEASE 
CAUSED BY ILL BURIED ROTTING BODIES CROWDED INTO CHURCH VAULTS AND GRAVEYARDS' 
SO STAGLIENO WAS OPENED ON JANUARY FIRST ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY ONE 
AND THIS CITY OF THE DEAD LIKE CITIES OF THE LIVING 
HAD ITS OWN SOCIAL HIERARCHIES 
YOUR STATUS IN LIFE WOULD DETERMINE YOUR POSITION IN DEATH 
THE ROTUNDA IS THE MAIN CHAPEL IN THE CEMETERY AND IT'S A SPLENDID PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE 
IT'S INSPIRED BY THE ANCIENT PANTHEON IN ROME THE TEMPLE OF ALL THE GODS 
AND THEREFORE IT'S RATHER APPROPRIATE 
THAT THE GREAT OF GENOA ARE COMMEMORATED IN THIS BUILDING 
WEALTH AND FAME SECURED YOU THE BEST LOCATIONS HERE 
BUT THE MIDDLE CLASS OF GENOA ALSO LOVED THIS CEMETERY 
THEY BROUGHT THEIR DEAD HERE 
AND THEY HONOURED THEM WITH SPECTACULAR MONUMENTS 
THAT WERE INTENDED TO GRANT IMMORTALITY 
IN THESE ARCADES MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES 
CREATED ELABORATE SHRINES TO HONOUR THEIR DEAD 
AND TO MAKE THEIR MEMORIALS TRULY IMPRESSIVE 
THE FAMILIES COMMISSIONED THE BEST ARTISTS IN ITALY 
WALKING HERE YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE MEETING THESE LONG DEAD PEOPLE 
GETTING TO MEET THEM AND THEIR MOURNERS TO SHARE IN THE MOURNERS' GRIEF 
THIS YOUNG LADY IS A WIDOW AND SHE'S LEAVING THE TOMB OF HER HUSBAND 
A CROSS AROUND HER NECK 
BIBLE IN HER HAND 
AND AN EXPRESSION ON HER FACE OF PURE SORROW 
MOST BEAUTIFUL 
OVER THE DECADES STAGLIENO'S COLLECTION OF SCULPTURE GREW 
TO MAKE IT ONE OF THE MOST AWE INSPIRING 
AND IMITATED CEMETERIES IN WORLD 
AND ONE STATUE MORE THAN ANY OTHER 
CAME TO DEFINE THE VALUES AND ASPIRATIONS OF STAGLIENO 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS MONUMENTS IN THE CEMETERY 
IT SHOWS CATERINA CAMPODONICO 
AND SHE WAS A HAWKER AT LOCAL FAIRS AND FEASTS 
AND DURING HER LIFETIME SHE PAID FOR THIS SPECTACULAR MONUMENT 
TO BE MADE USING HER SAVINGS HER MEAGRE SAVINGS FOR THIS SPECTACULAR OBJECT 
IT SHOWS HOW SHE MADE HER MONEY 
SHE SOLD NUTS AND BREAD AT THESE FAIRS 
THESE OBJECTS THESE TOOLS OF HER TRADE ARE PROUDLY SHOWN 
SHE'S NOT ASHAMED OF HOW SHE MADE HER MONEY 
AND I LOVE THE FACE 
SHE'S STARING DEFIANTLY IN THE FACE OF DEATH 
THIS STATUE GIVES HER A FOOTHOLD ON ETERNITY 
AND ALSO SHOWS THAT IN DEATH SHE AT LAST GAINED SOME 
ARTISTS GREW IN AMBITION INTRODUCING INCREASINGLY INVENTIVE WAYS OF APPROACHING DEATH 
THE CEMETERY BECAME MORE FAMOUS FOR THE QUALITY OF ITS ART THAN THE PEOPLE BURIED THERE 
AH HERE'S A VERY CHARMING SOLID MIDDLE CLASS COUPLE 
WEALTHY TRADESPEOPLE I SHOULD THINK 
VERY REALISTICALLY RENDERED 
LOVELY 
BUT ABOVE THEM AN EXTRAORDINARY SCENE IS BEING ENACTED 
HERE IS A SKELETON ON ITS BACK 
IT'S DEATH THE GRIM REAPER 
HERE'S HIS SCYTHE 
AND FLAMES ARE BURSTING THROUGH THE RIB CAGE HERE 
HE'S BEING STRUCK BY A BOLT OF LIGHTNING 
ALL OF THIS IS BEING ORCHESTRATED BY THIS VERY CHARMING ANGEL 
THE PERSONIFICATION OF ETERNAL LIFE PROMISED BY CHRIST 
SO HERE WE SEE THE VALUES OF THIS COUPLE 
THEY ACHIEVE IMMORTALITY THROUGH COMMISSIONING ART AND THROUGH THEIR CHRISTIAN BELIEF 
DEATH ITSELF IS BEING DESTROYED 
BY THE TURN OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
OLD CHRISTIAN CERTAINTIES ABOUT RESURRECTION AND THE AFTERLIFE BEGAN TO BE QUESTIONED 
THE SYMBOLISM BECAME MORE OUTLANDISH 
ARTISTS EXPLORED THEIR DARKEST FANTASIES 
PRODUCING STATUES THAT WERE DISTURBING SENSUOUS EROTIC 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST STRANGELY DARKLY THRILLING TOMBS IN THE ENTIRE CEMETERY 
IT WAS MADE FOR A LOCAL RICH BUSINESSMAN 
BUT MOST OF THE IMAGERY HERE HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH HIM IN PARTICULAR 
IT'S MORE ELEMENTAL MORE PRIMAL 
IT'S TO DO WITH THE DANCE OF DEATH 
AND HERE YOU SEE THE IMAGE ABOVE ME 
LIFE IS REPRESENTED BY THIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN 
AND SHE'S WRITHING IN THE GRIP OF DEATH 
HIS SKELETON HIS BONY HAND AROUND HER WRIST 
SHE'S TURNING AWAY BUT SHE'S TIRING OF THE STRUGGLE 
IT'S FUTILE INEVITABLE DEATH WILL COME DEATH WILL CLAIM HER 
IN THIS TOMB THERE IS NO PROMISE OF ETERNAL LIFE 
DEATH IS TRIUMPHANT 
THE LESS WELL OFF ALSO HAVE THEIR PLACE IN THE CEMETERY 
ALL GENOESE CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE BURIED IN STAGLIENO 
THEN YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO REMAIN IN THE GROUND FOR TOO LONG 
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE BURIED ON A TEN YEAR LEASE 
WHEN THE LEASE RUNS OUT THEIR BONES WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE GROUND 
AND THEIR TOMBSTONES DESTROYED 
WELL I SEE YOU'RE DIGGING A GRAVE 
AND I CAN SEE IN THE GRAVE BITS OF COFFIN THERE 
AND HERE'S A BIT OF A HEADSTONE SO SOMEONE'S BEEN BURIED HERE BEFORE 
WILL YOU BE DUG UP AFTER TEN YEARS 
IN STAGLIENO THE MYSTERIES OF DEATH REMAIN 
BUT IN THESE PICTURESQUE SURROUNDINGS 
THE BEAUTY OF THE ART MAKES DEATH SEEM MORE NOBLE 
MORE FAMILIAR 
AN ALMOST BLISSFUL EXPERIENCE 
THIS IS THE MOST SACRED SITE IN INDIA 
VARANASI ON THE RIVER GANGES 
HINDUS BELIEVE THAT INDIA IS THE SPIRITUAL CENTRE 
THE NAVEL OF THE WORLD 
AND THAT VARANASI IS THE CENTRE OF THE CENTRE THE HOLY OF HOLIES 
THIS IS A VERY VERY ANCIENT CITY 
THEY SAY IT'S WHERE CREATION STARTED 
AND WHERE THE WORLD AND TIME WILL END 
MORE THAN A MILLION PILGRIMS COME TO VARANASI EVERY YEAR TO BATHE AT DAWN AND TO PRAY 
THEY CONGREGATE ON THE GHATS THE STONE TERRACES THAT LEAD DOWN TO THE SACRED WATER 
AND BELIEVE THIS RITUAL BATHING WILL PURIFY THEM AND WASH AWAY THEIR SINS' 
BODIES OF THE DEAD ARE BROUGHT HERE FOR CREMATION 
FOR THIS IS THE CITY OF THE HINDU GOD SHIVA 
KNOWN AS THE CONQUEROR OF DEATH 
AND THE GANGES IS THE WATERY BODY OF THE GREAT GODDESS GANGA 
THE RIVER OF HEAVEN THAT CARRIES SOULS TO ETERNITY 
VARANASI HAS BEEN A PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
AND THE NARROW ALLEYWAYS ARE FULL OF WONDERFUL SIGHTS' 
A JOURNEY THROUGH THIS CITY 
IS A JOURNEY TO THE SACRED HEART OF HINDU INDIA 
ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE PROGRESSING TO AND FROM THE GREAT SHIVA TEMPLE OVER THERE 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SHIVA TEMPLES IN INDIA 
THIS IS A SACRED TERRAIN 
HERE'S A SACRED COW 
GET A BLESSING FROM HER 
AND LITTLE TEMPLES EACH SIDE AND MORE COWS HERE 
YOU REALLY DO GET THE SENSE THIS IS A GREAT HOLY CITY 
DESPITE THEIR PAIN AND SUFFERING 
MANY VERY ILL PEOPLE MAKE THEIR WAY TO VARANASI 
OR ARE BROUGHT HERE BY THEIR FAMILIES 
BECAUSE HINDUS BELIEVE IF YOU DIE HERE 
YOU ARE GRANTED THE GREAT GIFT OF MOKSHA BY SHIVA 
MOKSHA IS THE RELEASE FROM ETERNAL AND OFTEN PAINFUL 
BIRTH DEATH AND REBIRTH ON THE EARTH 
AND WHILE THE FAMILIES WAIT FOR THE END 
MANY OF THEM STAY IN DYING HOUSES SUCH AS THIS ONE 
THE MUKTIBHAVAN IS ONE OF THE TWO MAJOR DYING HOUSES IN VARANASI 
THAT ACCOMMODATE FAMILIES WHILE THEY AWAIT THE DEATH OF A RELATIVE 
THOUSANDS HAVE COME HERE TO DIE 
THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR THE SICK 
IT'S ONLY FOR FAMILIES TO BRING RELATIVES WHO ARE VERY CLOSE TO DEATH 
AS A NON FAMILY MEMBER I'M INCREDIBLY PRIVILEGED 
TO HAVE BEEN ALLOWED INSIDE THIS DYING HOUSE 
I'M GOING TO MEET A GENTLEMEN WHO VERY KINDLY HAS INVITED ME TO HIS MOTHER'S DYING ROOM

TO PREPARE FOR THE DEATH OF THEIR RELATIVE 
THIS CALF SACRED IN INDIA HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN 
TO HELP THE DYING WOMAN ON HER JOURNEY TO HEAVEN 
THE CALF AND THE WOMAN ARE ANOINTED 
AND THIS RITUAL IS TO ENSURE 
THAT THE CALF WILL GUIDE AND SAFEGUARD HER SOUL ON ITS WAY TO GOD 
THE MOOD IS RELAXED 
PEOPLE ARE EVEN LAUGHING 
BECAUSE THE FAMILY BELIEVE THAT AT THIS MOMENT 
THE GOD SHIVA HAS ENTERED THE ROOM TO PROMISE MOKSHA TO THE WOMAN 
THAT HER SOUL WILL BE RELEASED AFTER SHE DIES'

AND I REALLY FELT THAT THERE 
THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS AUSPICIOUS FOR ME TO BE THERE 
I WAS A LUCKY MAN 
MANY LIVES HAVE LED ME HERE HE SAID TO VARANASI AT THIS MOMENT 
AND I SORT OF FEEL IT 
DEATH IS BIG BUSINESS IN VARANASI 
IT'S INSPIRED AND INDEED FUNDED MUCH OF THE ARCHITECTURE 
AND OF COURSE IS A WAY OF LIFE 
THERE ARE LOTS OF SHOPS THAT SPECIALISE IN SELLING ARTICLES NEEDED FOR FUNERALS FOR CREMATIONS 
HERE'S ONE I'LL JUST SEE WHAT'S AVAILABLE

MOST DIDN'T DIE IN VARANASI 
BUT JUST TO BE CREMATED HERE IS A BLESSING 
CREMATIONS TAKE PLACE AT TWO GHATS ON THE RIVER 
THIS IS THE MOST POPULAR ONE MANIKARNIKA 
A SPECIFIC CASTE OF FUNERAL ATTENDANTS CALLED DOMS OVERSEE ALL THE CREMATIONS' 
IT'S ALL SO PUBLIC AND OPEN 
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY FEELING BEING HERE 
IN THE WEST OF COURSE WE ASSOCIATE DEATH 
ALMOST LIKE SOMETHING EMBARRASSING 
SOMETHING TO BE DENIED NOT TO BE CONFRONTED 
BUT HERE IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF COURSE 
THIS PUBLIC CEREMONY WHERE PEOPLE COME AND GATHER AND SAY THEIR FAREWELLS IN A JOYOUS WAY 
IS ALTOGETHER EXTRAORDINARY UPLIFTING 
AND ANOTHER BODY'S ARRIVING 
YOU HEAR PEOPLE CHANTING AND BELLS RINGING 
CARRIED BY THE FAMILY MEMBERS 
THE GREAT LAST JOURNEY 
HOLY GANGES WATER BEING POURED OVER IT 
AND UM IN A MOMENT NOW 
IT'LL BE TAKEN TO ITS PILE OF LOGS AND BE CREMATED 
THE SOUL LIBERATED THE SOUL SENT ON ITS WAY 
AND BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING HERE OF COURSE IN VARANASI 
THE SOUL WON'T HAVE TO BE REBORN 
IT WILL RETURN TO GOD UNITY WITH THE ALMIGHTY 
SO THIS IS A GLORIOUS MOMENT AND YOU SEE THE PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT SOMBRE IN PARTICULAR 
PEOPLE WATCHING CHATTING LAUGHING 
A TERRIFIC CELEBRATION THIS 
A PUBLIC CELEBRATION OF DEATH 
THIS LAST STAGE IN THE JOURNEY OF THE DEAD MAY BE SHOCKING TO WESTERN EYES 
BUT TO HINDUS IT IS THE JOYFUL MOMENT OF THE RELEASE OF THE SOUL 
VARANASI'S AN ASTONISHING EXPLOSION OF EMOTION 
WITHIN A THRILLING ARCHITECTURAL SETTING 
THAT'S TRANSFORMED MY PERCEPTION OF DEATH 
BEFORE COMING HERE I SAW DEATH AS SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS TERRIFYING 
ALMOST DIVINE ABERRATION 
BUT HAVING WANDERED ROUND IT'S ALL NOW VERY DIFFERENT 
HERE DEATH IS A THING OF VISUAL SENSUOUS BEAUTY 
IT'S A JOURNEY OF LIBERATION A JOURNEY TO BE EMBRACED
