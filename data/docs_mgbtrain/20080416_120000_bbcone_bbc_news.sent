MILLIONS OF US TAKE VITAMINS 
BECAUSE WE THINK THEY'RE GOOD FOR 
OUR HEALTH AND COULD EVEN HELP US 
LIVE LONGER BUT RESEARCHERS IN 
DENMARK SAY THAT FAR FROM 
PROLONGING OUR LIVES SOME COULD BE 
HARMFUL IN LARGE DOSES AND ACTUALLY 
SHORTEN OUR LIVES IN A REVIEW OF 
PREVIOUS STUDIES THEY FOUND THAT 
VITAMIN E. ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR 
ANTI OXIDANTS SUPPLEMENTS ON SALE 
COULD INCREASE THE RISK OF DYING 
EARLIER BY FOUR PER CENT BETA CAROTENE AND BY 
SEVEN PER CENT AND VITAMIN A GETS SIXTEEN PER CENT 
INCREASED RISK WHILE VITAMIN C. HAD 
NO POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EFFECT IT 
IS ESTIMATED THAT FOUR IN TEN OF US 
IN THE U. K. 
DO TAKE VITAMIN 
IN THE U. K. DO TAKE VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS IT'S AN INDUSTRY WORTH 
AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION A YEAR 
WITH ME IS BRIDGET AISBETT FROM THE 
BRITISH NUTRITION FOUNDATION WHO 
IS THIS INDUSTRY PROPERTY INCOME OF 
WHAT IS YOUR VIEW SHOULD BE 
STOPPED TAKING THE VITAMINS NOW 
I'VE THINK FOR THE MAJORITY OF US 
WE CAN GET EVERYTHING WE NEED FROM 
A HEALTHY BALANCED DIET AND WE 
DON'T NEED TO TAKE SUPPLEMENTS 
WHAT SORT OF DOSES OF THE TALKING 
ABOUT SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE 
INDIVIDUAL VITAMINS WE HAVE 
DISCUSSED BED 
THERE WERE A RANGE 
OF DOSES USED IN THIS STUDY BUT 
THEY DID GET QUITE HIGH MORE THAN 
THE NEED FOR OUR DAILY REQUIREMENTS 
THAT IS A MESSAGE THAT PEOPLE NEED 
TO TAKE NOTE OF NOT TO TAKE 
EXCESSIVE DOSES OF SINGLE VITAMINS 
IS IT CONFUSING FOR THE CONSUMER 
YES I THINK IT COULD BE BUT WHAT 
PEOPLE NEED TO DO IS READ THE 
INSTRUCTIONS ON A PACKET AND NOT 
TAKE ANY MORE THAN HAS RECOMMENDED 
BUT SHOULD THERE BE BETTER 
REGULATION OF THE INDUSTRY IF WE 
ARE HAVING THESE SORTS OF REPORTS 
WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY WORRYING 
THEY ARE WORRYING IT'S IMPORTANT 
TO KNOW THAT THESE DOSES WERE HIGH 
AND HOPEFULLY NOT WHAT PEOPLE WOULD 
NORMALLY TAKE IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT 
TO SAY FROM THIS KIND OF STUDY WHY 
THIS HAPPENED WHY THIS INCREASE IN 
MORTALITY HAPPENED WE CAN'T SAY 
DIRECTLY A PARTICULAR MECHANISM BY 
WHICH THE VITAMINS CAUSE THIS BUT 
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE NEED TO 
TAKE NOTE OF 
THE HEALTH 
SUPPLEMENTS INFORMATION SERVICE IS 
CONDUCTING THIS BY SAYING THESE 
VITAMINS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR HEALTH 
MANY PEOPLE IN THE U. K. DON'T HAVE AN 
ADEQUATE ADEQUATE INTAKE ARE 
NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING SO THERE 
FOR A SUPPLEMENT CAN BE BENEFICIAL 
FOR HEALTH 
THEY ARE BENEFICIAL FOR 
HEALTH BUT JUST BECAUSE WE NEED 
SOME OF THEM IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT 
MORE IS BETTER AND MORE CAN 
UNBALANCE OUR SYSTEM IT'S BETTER 
TO GET THEM FROM FOOD IN ADDITION 
FOOD WILL GIVE YOU ALL SORTS OF 
OTHER THINGS YOU WON'T GET FROM A 
SUPPLEMENT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT 
YOUR DIET RATHER THAN TAKING A PILL 
FED SEE IF WE CAN CHEER YOU UP WITH 
NEWS ON THE ECONOMY WE'VE HAD SOME 
RATHER GLOOMY REPORTS OF LATE BUT 
TODAY THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS 
LATEST FIGURES SHOW UNEMPLOYMENT IS 
DOWN WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE IN WORK SINCE CURRENT 
RECORDS BEGAN IN NINETEEN SEVENTIES OUR 
ECONOMIC CORRESPONDENT PUTS INTO 
CONTEXT FOR US THERE MAY BE A 
GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS WITH NERVES 
ON EDGE IN THE DEALING ROOMS THE 
HOUSING MARKET MAY BE FALLING IN 
MOST PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THERE 
ARE BIG WORRIES ABOUT RISING PRICES 
FOR EVERYDAY ITEMS BUT WHEN IT 
COMES TO JOBS THEN USES STILL 
UNEXPECTEDLY GOOD HERE IS AN 
EXAMPLE TODAY IN SWANSEA THE 
MAIL ORDER GIANT AMAZON IS OPENING 
A NEW LOGISTICS CENTRE WHICH WILL 
CREATE TWELVE HUNDRED FULL TIME NEW JOBS 
PLEASE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED AND 
ENTHUSIASTIC AND WANT TO BE PART OF 
THE GROWTH OF AMAZON GET YOUR 
APPLICATION IN 
TODAY'S FIGURES FOR 
THE WHOLE ECONOMY ARE IMPRESSIVE 
EMPLOYMENT 
EMPLOYMENT IS AT A RECORD HIGH 
TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WERE WORKING IN 
THE U. K. IN THE THREE MONTHS TO 
FEBRUARY THERE WERE SIXTEEN MILLION 
OUT OF WORK THAT'S DOWN THIRTY NINE THOUSAND 
OTHER PREVIOUS THREE MONTHS 
THIS IS A STUNNING SET OF FIGURES 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST RISE FOR THE 
PAST TEN YEARS AND EMPLOYMENT THE 
REAL QUESTION WE HAVE ASKED US 
WHERE IT IS THE LABOUR MARKET GOING 
TO GO IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THE 
LABOUR MARKET IS WHAT ECONOMISTS 
WOULD CALL A LAGGING INDICATOR IT 
DOESN'T TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT WHAT'S 
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE IT TELLS 
YOU MORE ABOUT THE PAST ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH THINGS ARE SET FAIR IN SOME PARTS 
OF THE ECONOMY THERE ARE CERTAIN 
THE CLOUDS HANGING OVER THE CITY OF 
LONDON THE CREDIT CRUNCH HAS HIT 
BANKS' PROFITS THERE HAVE BEEN 
SOME LAY OFFS AND THERE ARE 
PREDICTIONS THAT AS MANY AS FORTY THOUSAND 
CITY JOBS COULD GO AND IF PEOPLE 
LOSE THEIR JOBS IN FINANCIAL 
SERVICES THEY WON'T SPEND SO MUCH 
AND THAT COULD AFFECT EMPLOYMENT IN 
THE LEISURE AND RETAIL INDUSTRIES 
THE CLIMATE IS ALREADY COOLING ON 
THE HIGH STREET THE DISCOUNT 
CLOTHING CHAIN ETHEL AUSTIN HAS 
BEEN PUT INTO ADMINISTRATION TODAY 
JJB SPORTS SAID IT WOULD CUT SEVENTY TWO 
STORES WERE THE LOSS OF EIGHT HUNDRED JOBS 
MANY IN RETAILING A WARNING OF 
TOUGHER TIMES AHEAD L. WAS TRYING 
TO PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON IT REALLY 
AT THE BEGINNING BUT JUDGING FROM 
THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT 
IS THAT LAGGING INDICATOR THAT YOU 
MENTIONED IN THE REPORT THE PAST 
WHERE IS THE NEWS MAY NOT BE SO 
GREAT NOW 
NO REASON TO BE CHURLISH 
IT CLEARLY IS GOOD NEWS IN THE 
SENSE THAT IT IS RECORD EMPLOYMENT 
AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN ON THE 
GOVERNMENT'S PREFERRED MEASURE L. 
THINK A LOT OF ECONOMISTS WERE 
SURPRISED ABOUT THAT SO IT IS 
SURPRISINGLY GOOD NEWS IN THAT 
SENSE ONE SHOULD AND IN ANY WAY 
TRY TO DETRACT FROM THAT GOOD NEWS 
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN WORK BUT IT 
DOES TEND TO BE A LAGGING INDICATOR 
IN THE SENSE WE HAVE STRONG GROWTH 
LAST YEAR SO THIS COULD BE A 
REFLECTION STILL OF THAT ECONOMIC 
ACTIVITY IF YOU LOOK BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
WHEN WE LAST HAD A GROWTH SLOWDOWN 
IN THE ORDER OF WHAT'S BEEN 
PREDICTED THIS YEAR UNEMPLOYMENT 
PICKED UP WELL UNDER TWO THOUSAND SIX MAYBE WE 
ARE GOING TO SEE IT GOING THE OTHER 
WAY WE ARE SEEING RETAIL JOBS 
GOING WITH MANY RETAILERS WORRIED 
ABOUT CONSUMER SPENDING POWER AND 
HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE AFFECTED ON ON THE FRONT LINE DURING THE COLD WAR 
THE R. A. F.'S VULCAN BOMBER HAS RARELY 
BEEN SEEN IN THIS DYSON'S NOW 
AFTER ELEVEN YEARS AND SEVEN MILLION A 
FULLY RESTORED BOMBER IS ABOUT TO 
COME OUT OF RETIREMENT 
WHEN THE BALKAN TO THE SKIES GROUP 
BOUGHT HIS BED WHEN BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE I 
THINK THEY PROBABLY WONDERED WHAT 
THEY WERE TAKING ON IT HAS NOT 
BEEN AN EASY RIDE GETTING HER BACK 
TO FLYING CONDITION BUT SHE IS ON 
THE TARGET TARMAC YEAR ABOUT TO 
TAKE ON THE FINAL TEST IF SHE 
PASSES IT OVER EAST ANGLIA THIS 
AFTERNOON SHE WILL BE REGARDED AS 
FIT TO APPEAR BEFORE THE PUBLIC AT 
AIR SHOWS THIS SUMMER BOWKER X. RAY 
HOTEL FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT RETIRED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS BUT 
LIKE SO MANY OF HER HUMAN 
CONTEMPORARIES STILL ABLE TO PUT 
IN A GOOD DAY'S WORK 
THIS IS THE 
BOMBER CONTROLLER SCRAMBLE 
STRIKING OR SINISTER SHE WAS THE 
ICONIC COLD WAR WARRIOR THE PLANE 
THAT CARRIED THE BOMB DURING THE 
PERIOD WHEN CONFRONTATION MEANT 
MUTUAL DESTRUCTION BUT DESPITE 
DECADES ON SENTRY DUTY THE FALCON 
ARE SO REAL ACTION JUST ONCE ON 
MISSION CODENAMED BLACK BUCK ONE THE 
ATTACK ON THE RUNWAY AT PORT 
STANLEY DURING THE FALKLANDS 
CONFLICT THE MAN WHO LED THAT 
MISSION WILL FLY TO HER AGAIN TODAY 
IT WAS A CLOSE RUN THING WE NEEDED 
EVERY SINGLE TANKER WE HAVEN'T THE 
AIR FORCE THEY ALL TOOK OFF FROM 
THE CENTRE LINE FULL OF FUEL THEY 
WERE REFUSING IT WAS ONLY JUST 
ENOUGH FUEL IN THE WHOLE FORMATION 
TO GET US THERE AND TO GET US BACK 
AGAIN 
KEEPING THE PLANE FLYING HAS AGAIN BEEN A BUMPY RIDE NO ONE HAS EVER 
ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE SUCH A COMPLEX 
MACHINE UNEXPECTED TECHNICAL 
HITCHES AND SPIRALLING COSTS HAVE 
PUT THE PROJECT IN JEOPARDY ON 
SEVERAL FORMER ENGINEERS WERE AMONG 
THE VOLUNTEERS WHO VIRTUALLY 
REBUILT THE BOMBER TO TODAY'S 
EXACTING SAFETY STANDARDS THEY 
LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS ARE 
WILLING HER TO SOAR OVER THIS FINAL 
HURDLE I TALKED ABOUT VOLUNTEERS 
FROM THE FORMER STAFF AND THE 
EDMONDSON YOU WORKED ON THE PLAINS 
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT WE GET THIS 
MACHINE FLYING SOME WOULD SAY 
CARRY THE BOMB AND IT'S SOMETHING 
WE SHOULD FORGET 
NO THE AEROPLANE 
WAS DESIGNED TO CARRY A NUCLEAR 
WEAPON YES BUT HER ROLE IS TO 
KEEP THE PEACE SHE DID THAT 
SUCCESSFULLY WE NEED TO BE TURNING 
BACK TO THE NATION TO TRY TO 
INSPIRE THE YOUNG BACK INTO 
ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES AND 
SCIENCE 
YOU'VE HAD DIFFICULT TIMES SCIENCE HAVE THEY BEEN OCCASIONS WHERE YOU 
DIDN'T THINK YOU EVEN GET TO TODAY 
VERY MUCH SO OR REVOLVING AROUND 
MONEY ALSO THE ENGINEER ON THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS DESIGNED FORTY ODD YEARS 
AGO TO RECONSTRUCT THOSE CONTRACTS 
TO OVERHAUL THE COMPONENTS HAS BEEN 
A MAJOR JOB 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
VERY QUICKLY IF YOU ARE WATCHING 
THE SKIES OVER THE EAST OF ENGLAND 
AND EAST ANGLIA SHE IS DUE TO GO 
OUT OF A NORFOLK THIS AFTERNOON IF 
YOU CAN'T SEE HER YOU MIGHT HEAR 
HER SHE WILL BE ON THE GROUND AND 
LEICESTERSHIRE AT TEATIME WE ARE 
OFTEN ACCUSED OF NOT TAKING THE 
EUROVISION SONG CONTEST SERIOUSLY 
ENOUGH HERE IN BRITAIN BUT THAT 
CAN'T BE SAID ABOUT FRANCE ITS 
ENTRY THIS YEAR HAS CAUSED A STORM 
OF PROTEST BECAUSE IT'S BEING SUNG 
IN ENGLISH 
THE FRENCH EUROVISION ENTRY 
PERFORMED BY A FRENCH POP STAR IN 
THE TRUE FRENCH STYLE BUT IT'S 
SUNG IN ENGLISH THE LYRICS MAY NOT 
BE ENTIRELY COMPREHENSIBLE BUT 
SINGH AS A BASTION TILEY IT SAYS 
ENGLISH HELPS CONVEY THE SUBTLE 
MESSAGE 
I WANT TO CONVEY TO THE MESSAGE WORLD THE SEXUALITY OF LIFE TO 
BE UNDERSTOOD L. NEED TO SING IN ENGLISH 
THE FRENCH ARE FIERCELY ENGLISH PROUD OF THEIR LANGUAGE THERE'S 
EVEN AN NATIONAL BODY TO PROTECT IT 
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME 
PEOPLE ARE HORRIFIED THAT FRANCE IS 
BEING REPRESENTED AT AN 
INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION IN 
ENGLISH THIS M. P. LOVES LEARNING 
LANGUAGES BUT HE IS WORRIED THAT 
ENGLISH IS TAKING OVER 
I THINK 
IT'S MORE THAN AMAZING IT'S A 
STUPID THIS MISTAKE THAT WOULD 
SAY THAT LAWS WOULD TRY TO MONKEY 
THE ENGLISH OR ANGLO SAXON CULTURE 
ARE IGNORING WHAT THEY ARE AND A 
BRAINWASHING 
AND IT ALL USED TO BE BRAINWASHING SO DIFFERENT NEARLY FIFTY YEARS AGO 
THE FRENCH EUROVISION ENTRY WAS 
QUINTESSENTIALLY FRENCH AS HE 
AUDITIONS SINGERS FOR HIS NEW 
MUSICAL THE MAN WHO HELPED CHOOSE 
THIS YEAR'S EUROVISION ENTRY SAYS 
TIME AND STYLE HAVE MOVED ON I I ALWAYS SAY IT DOESN'T WORK WITH 
FRENCH LANGUAGE THIS KIND OF MUSIC 
WE TRY BUT IT DOESN'T WORK WE 
DON'T SING IN ENGLISH TO WIN 
THAT'S ANOTHER COUNTRY WE JUST 
SING IN ENGLISH BECAUSE IT'S AN 
ARTISTIC CHOICE 
PRACTISING HIS ENGLISH VOWEL SOUNDS 
BEFORE THE BIG DAY SEBASTIEN IS 
HOPING FRANCE DON'T GET ITS USUAL 
ZERO POINTS

OF SOUTHERN ENGLAND DOWN TO THE
