WITH OTHER TO TO CAPTURE A MEDAL 
IT IS SMALL WONDER 
THE EXHIBITORS TAKE IT UP TO THE 
WIRE WITH THE JUDGES' DEADLINE SET 
AT THIS MORNING THE BATTLE WAS ON 
TO BEAT THE CLOCK WITHOUT LOSING 
THE PLOT TRANSFORMING THIS FLAT 
GREEN SITE INTO THE WORLD'S 
GREATEST FLOWER SHOW IS DAUNTING 
WHETHER YOU ARE AN EXHIBITOR A 
CONTRACTOR OR A DESIGNER 
I THINK 
I'M WORKING HARD BUT I ENJOY IT 
PEOPLE ARE ASTONISHED AND STUNNED 
BY THE FACT THAT IT IS GOING UP 
LIKE THIS AND THEY ARE BUILDING 
PROPERLY AND IT IS TAKEN DOWN IN A 
WEEK 
WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE WEEK HOURS SLEEP BUT THE ADRENALINE IS 
KICKING IN AT THIS STAGE WE ARE 
LAUGHING 
WE WILL FALL APART AFTER LAUGHING THIS PREPARATION HAS BEEN DOGGED BY 
RAIN MANY TIMES THIS YEAR THE 
WEATHER STILL MANAGED TO PLAY HAVOC 
BUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
THE PROBLEM 
WE HAVE HAD TO OVERCOME IS THE HEAT 
THAT HAS SLOWED THINGS DOWN IT HAS 
BEEN VERY HOT 
THE PLANTS ALMOST 
WILT AND WE ARE GETTING SUN BURN 
SO LOU DID THEY KEEP THEIR TEAMS 
GOING 
A LOT OF CUPS OF TEA AND GOING ENCOURAGEMENT 
MY TEAM WORK WELL IF ENCOURAGEMENT THEY GET DOUGHNUTS IF NOT I WILL 
TRY A WHIP 
BOYS THERE IS 
SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO BUT 
DID EVERYONE MANAGE TO STAY ON 
SCHEDULE 
WE ARE ALL BURNING THE SCHEDULE MIDNIGHT OIL SNUE ONLY AT THE PUB 
WE ARE FIVE DAYS BEHIND L. SEEM TO 
BE THE LAST PERSON TO PLANT THE 
GARDEN THIS YEAR THINKING AHEAD 
THE CONTRACTORS HAVE GOT SOME 
PROPER LIGHTS AND WE CAN DO IT 
UNDER FLOOT LIGHTS 
WITH HOURS TO 
GO LAST NIGHT THE SHOW GROUND WAS 
ALL LIT UP FOR SOME THERE WAS REASON TO 
CELEBRATE WHEN THE WORK WAS 
COMPLETE FOR OTHERS IT WAS A 
DIFFERENT STORY 
THIS IS A PANIC 
IT IS GETTING DARK AND WE ARE STILL 
HERE SO A BIT OF A STRESSY TIME 
WE HAVE TO GO AND GET THE LAST 
THINGS THE STRAWBERRIES ARE 
COVERED AND OTHERWISE THE BLACK 
BIRD WILL HAVE SUPPER 
WE ARE 
FINISHED AND ARE JUST TIDYING UP 
BUT WE LIKE TO BE TIDY FOR PRESS 
DAY 
WE HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE DAWN DAY AND IT IS NOW WHAT IS IT TEN TO 
WE ARE NOT FINISHED WELL WE ARE 
FINISHED BUT IT IS TRYING TO MAKE 
EVERYTHING PERFECT 
BY BURNHAM NURSERIES 
THIS IS THE CUTTING EDGE OF 
HORTICULTURAL AUCOUTURE 
THIS IS THE FIRST GARDEN HE HAS 
DESIGNED AND BUILT 
NOT ONLY IS HE COMPETING WITH THE 
BEST HE IS DOING SOMETHING HE 
NEVER PRACTISED BEFORE 
THAT'S A MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR FETE OF 
ENGINEERING ENGINEERING HERE WE ARE BROADCASTING IT IS 
GALA NIGHT TONIGHT 
THERE IS CHINESE GARDEN THERE 
THIS ONE IS DESIGNED BY SAVLES 
WHICH IS CUTTING EDGE BUT MORE 
ENGLISH YOU HAVE THIS CENTRAL 
ACCESS HERE AND FOR AN ARTIST WHO 
COLLECTS PICTURES AND MODERN 
SCULPTURES IT WAS SERIES OF FRAMES FRAMES CONTEMPORARY CLASSIC I LIKE IT 
BUT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR MEDALS 
THEY ARE NOT COMPETING AGAINST EACH 
OTHER THEY ARE ONLY COMPETING 
AGAINST THEIR BRIEF AND THE HIGHEST 
ACCOLADE IS BEST IN SHOW 
EVERY CHELSEA GARDEN MAKES USE OF 
THREE DIMENSIONINGS LENGTH HEIGHT 
AND BREDTH 
AT LEAST FOUR OF THEM MAKE USE OF 
DEPTH THIS IS ANDY STURGEON'S 
GARDEN FOR CANCER RESEARCH U. K. 
YOU WANDER AMONG THE GROVE OFTRY 
FERNS AMONG WALKWAY AND THEN YOU 
GO DOWN 
TO THE DEPTHS TO THIS SUNKEN 
TERRACE AREA AND DARK POOL FULLY 
A METER LOWER THAN THIS YOU REALLY 
ARE GETTING A GARDEN HERE WHICH 
SEEMS TO GO OUT IN ALL DIRECTION 
UP DOWN AND OUT 
THIS IS BY PAUL COOPER AND THE 
INSPIRATION HAS COME FROM VENICE 
AND THIS LIMESTONE HAS BEEN 
IMPORTED FROM ITALY L. HAVE GOT TO 
BE CAREFUL WHERE I THREAD THERE IS 
A LOT OF WATER IN THIS GARDEN 
THE CONCEPT THAT THIS IS THE EYE 
LEVEL AND EVERYTHING BELOW HERE IS 
BELOW THE WATER LEVEL WE HAVE THE 
STONE COL COLUMNS AND WE HAVE GOT 
THE WOODEN PILES ON THE OTHER SIDE 
WHICH ARE THE WOODEN PILES THAT 
WOULD HOLD UP THE BUILDINGS IN 
VENICE PAUL COOPER LIKES TO 
EXPERIMENT WITH IDEAS AND THIS TIME 
HE HAS REALLY PUSHED THE GONDOLA 
OUT OUT I THOUGHT THE GARDENS HERE WERE 
MEANT TO BE TOPNOTCH PEAK 
CONDITION FREE OF PESTS AND 
DISEASES BUT THIS ONE ONE ISN'T 
YOU CAN TELL KIDS HAD HAND IN IT 
CAN'T YOU THIS IS MARSHALLS GARDEN 
IT IS DESIGNED BY IAN DEXTER AND A 
LOT OF SCHOOLCHILDREN CHILDREN 
SHOULD FEEL FREE TO HAVE FUN IN AND 
AT ITS HEART THIS ENORMOUS CARVED 
STONE SNAKE THE PATH GOES AROUND 
THERE AND LEADS TO TUNNEL INTO 
THE UNDERGROWTH NO PARENT COULD 
ARGUE THIS WASN'T A GOOD LOOKING 
GARDENING GARDENING THE KIDS WILL GO WILD 
THE Q. V. C. GARDEN IS ABOUT TEXTURE 
THEY HAVE PAIRED DOWN THE ELEMENTS 
TO MAKE IT SIMPLE BUT INCREDIBLY 
EFFECTIVE EFFECTIVE IT IS NOT A PURELY MINIMALIST 
GARDEN BUT THERE IS THE FEELING OF 
SPACE HERE AND I LOVE THE CONTRAST 
AND SECRETARIES TURES OF THE 
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT STONE AND THE 
PLANTING HAS KNITTED TOGETHER AND 
COME REALLY GOOD THE THING I LIKE 
ABOUT THIS GARDEN IT IS ONE YOU 
CAN REALLY LIVE WITH 
WHAT ARE THE OVERVIEW THIS YEAR 
THEN JOE WHAT ARE THE GARDENERS 
TELLING US ABOUT THE WAY GARDEN 
DESIGN IS PROGRESSING AND GOING ON 
THE SEASON'S DESIGNERS WHO HAVE 
GOLD STACKED UP BEHIND IT ARE 
SIMPIFYING IT MORE AND MORE THERE 
IS LOTS OF GREEN WE KNOW THAT 
SOME OF THE OTHER DESIGNERS ARE 
TRYING TO CRAM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
INTO THE GARDEN FEATURES AND WATER 
AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT COLOURS AND 
OVERCOMPLICATING YOU ARE GETTING A 
SPLIT IN A WAY 
YOU ARE GETTING CROWD PLEASERS ON 
THE ONE HAND AND PEOPLE WHO ARE 
SAYING I AM PIONEER BECAUSE THIS 
IS WHERE I THINK IT IS GOING AND 
THEY ARE RISKING THE JUDGES SAYING 
IT IS NOT ENOUGH 
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH COLOUR AND 
INTEREST THIS IS IS CHELSEA WE 
WANT TO SEE MORE FLISHINESS 
FLASHINESS FLASHINESS WE USE WORDS LIKE BOLD 
AMBITIOUS 
VERY BRAVE MOVE AMBITIOUS INTERESTING CONCEPT 
THE THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THIS IS 
JUST FASCINATING 
WE TOLD YOU NOW YOU KNOW WHAT TO 
LISTENMENT YOU CAN HEAR WHAT THE 
EXPERTS THINK OF CHELSEA IN THEIR 
VIDEO BLOGS 
LOG ON TO

PERIOD IN HIS LIFE 
HOW DID HIS GARDEN TASTE DEVELOP

MEDITATING YVONNE YOU PUT THIS 
TOGETHER WITH LIVIA WHAT WERE YOU 
TRYING TO SHOW YOU HAD LOT TO 
CHOOSE FROM WE FELT WE NEEDED TO 
SHOW GEORGE THE GARDENER AS OPPOSED 
TO THE ALL ROUNDED GEORGE THE ONLY 
WAY TO DO IT WAS A NARRATIVE WAY OF 
SHOWING HIS BOYHOOD EACH PART IS 
BRIEF THIS IS THE BIGGEST PART 
THIS IS THE ETERNAL PART AND YOU

ZBLU PUT TOGETHER YOU PUT 
TOGETHER GARDEN WHICH IS A CHANGE

SHORT DISTANCE FROM SANDRINGHAM 
AND MORE DAINTY DISHS TO SET BEFORE 
A QUEEN THIS IS ONE STALL IT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK BY THEY HAVE 
BEEN PUT TOGETHER BY DEVINE 
NURSERIES IT IS A FLORAL FIREWORK 
DISPLAY YOU TEND TO FORGET THEY 
ARE THERE THROUGH WINTER AND THEN 
THEY RISE UP AND GIVE THIS DISPLAY 
THEY ARE A MOST SOME PLANTS ARE 
BORN TO BE ON THE STAGE THIS IRIS 
IS ONE LOOK AT THE SHAPES AND 
COLOURS OF THE FLOWER IF YOU WANT 
A REAL SHOW OFF HERE THEY HAVE THE 
PEONNY IT MAY ONLY BE AROUND FOR A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS OF THE YEAR BUT 
YOU CAN'T TELL ME THIS DUCHESS OF 
KENT ISN'T A FLIRT HERE I AM AMONG 
ONE OF MY FAVOURITES THIS A THORN 
CROFT NURSERY WHO SPECIALISE IN 
CLEMATIS LOOK AT THIS A SUBTLE 
CLEMATIS BUT THEY HAVE SOME NEW 
VARIETIES THIS BIG ONE IS CALLED 
FOND MEMORIES IT HAS THIS PINKIE 
WHITE AND THE PURPLE EDGE HERE WE 
HAVE ONE CALLED MORNING STAR IF 
YOU HAVE AN OLD WALL OR FENCE 
SOMETHING THAT IS RUSTIC LET THE 
CLEMATIS SCRAMBLE OVER IT IT 
WARRANTS A PLACE IN ANYBODY'S 
GARDEN ONE THING ABOUT BEING A 
GARDENER YOU COME ACROSS THE 
VARIETIES THAT CAN COME FROM ONE 
JEE NEWS HERE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE 
THERE ARE OVER THREE THOUSAND VARIETIES OF 
THIS PLANT AND WHAT IS STUNNING IS 
THE RANGE OF FLOWERS THEY HAVE 
BEEN GROWING THESE PLANTS THAT 
WOULD BE PRETTY HARD TO PAINT IT 
IS A PIECE OF ART IN ITS OWN RIGHT 
ONE PLANT THAT HAS COME INTO VOGUE 
IS LAVEND A. R. IT LOOKS LAVENDER 
AS YOU WALK UP THE SCENT DOES HIT 
YOU DOWN DERRY NURSERIES HAVE PUT 
ON THIS DISPLAY L. HAVE TRIED TO 
PICK OUT A COUPLE ONE IS CALLED 
FAT HEAD IT IS NICE AND SQUAT AND 
STAYS CLOSE TO THE GROUND HERE IS 
A REAL FAVOURITE IT IS IMPERIAL 
GEM IT LOOKS FANTASTIC WHEN YOU

PLANT IS A CLASSIC IT HAS A 
VARIETY OF NICK NAMES SOME CALL IT 
GRANNY'S BONNET L. KNOW IT AS 
DANCING LADIES THIS ONE IS CALLED 
SONG BIRD IT HAS AN INCREDIBLE 
ARRANGEMENT AND THIS ONE COMES IN 
MANY FORMS THIS PLANTS HAS BEEN 
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME L. THINK IT 
WILL BE HERE FOR MANY YEARS TO COME 
ALAN WHAT IS THE PREDATOR THAT THE 
EXHIBITORS HEAR HERE FEAR THE MOST 
GREEN FLY NO 
VINE WEEL 
NO IT IS NO THE R. H. S. JUDGES THEY WERE OUT IN 
FORCE HERE HUNGRY FOR PERFECTION 
IT IS EIGHT A M. AND THE TOOLS ARE DOWN 
THE PLANTS ARE IN AND THE MOMENT OF 
TRUTH HAS ARRIVED THE JUDGING HAS 
BEGUN WHAT EVERYONE WANTS IS ONE 
OF THESE THE MOST COVETED AWARD 
AT CHELSEA A GOLD MEDAL THERE ARE 
OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY JUDGES INVOLVED AND THIS 
YEAR A NEW JUDGE HAS JOINED THE 
RANKS THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME 
JUDGING HERE WHAT IS IT LIKE BEING 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OFFENCE 
IT IS 
REVEALING THE COMPLEXITY OF THE 
PROCESS IT FRIGHTENS ME TO THINK I 
MAY COME BACK AND FACE THE WRATH OF 
THIS LOT L. HAD BETTER JOIN THEM I I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IF DESIGNERS 
MUST BE FEELING HAVING THAT POSSE 
OF JUDGES ON YOUR QUARDEN GARDEN 
IT MUST BE NERVE WRACKING YOU LOOK 
SO NERVOUS TALK TO ME HOW ARE YOU 
FEELING 
THIS IS THE MOMENT OF FEELING TRUTH AFTER THE HARD MONTHS OF 
HARD HARD WORK I'M PRETTY NERVOUS 
THE STANDARD IS EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF ALL THE 
GARDENS ARE THAT MUCH BETTER DOES 
IT RAISE THE BAR AND MEAN THAT THE 
GARDENS HAVE TO TRY HARDER TO GET A 
GOLD MEDAL 
THERE IS SOME NERVES 
AND SOME RELIEF DO YOU THINK YOU YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING MORE THAN YOU 
HAVE ALREADY DONE YOU KNOW FROM 
THIS POINT YOU CAN RAE LAX AND 
ENJOY YOUR GARDENS RELAX THEY THEY GET MARKED DOWN FOR MARKET IMPACT 
BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE 
POSITIVES FIRST 
THERE WILL BE SOME 
WHO DON'T LIKE IT L. HOPE THAT THE 
GARDEN MIGHT PLEASE PEOPLE IN 
DIFFERENT WAYS THERE IS A LOT OF 
COLOUR AT THE FRONT AND IT IS GREEN 
AND CALM AND AT AND BACK 
SO YOU 
ARE HEDGING YOUR BETS YES 
A FEW YES GOLDS TO BE HANDED OUT 
THEY THERE 
MAY BE SOME SMILING FACES 
THAT IS 
AS MUCH AS THE JUDGES HAVE EVER 
REVEALED 
WITH 
THE JUDGING OVER REVEALED THE DESIGNERS HAVE A LONG NIGHT 
AHEAD TO WAIT FOR THE RESULTS 
THAT WAS JAPANESE FOR HELLO ANY ANY WAY THE PRESSURE IS ON THROUGHOUT 
THE SHOW HERE A COURT YARD GARDEN 
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD MEDAL 
BUT THESE ARE NOT HIGH END DESIGN 
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL THEY AREN'T 
CUTTING EDGE BUT THEY ARE THINGS 
PEOPLE LOVE THEY ARE DESIGNED BY 
SALE LANDSCAPES AND IT IS MEANT TO 
POINT UP THE BIODIVERSITY IN 
ENGLISH RUINS LIKE THESE OLD 
THINGS THAT ARE FALLING DOWN THEY 
WONDERFUL PLACES FOR BITS OF NATURE 
YOU HAVE GONE FAR NORTH 
I HAVE 
GONE TO THE SHETLAND THIS IS THE 
SHETLAND HOUSE CROFT GARDEN THERE 
IS A LOT OF ICONS OF SHETLAND HERE 
THERE IS THE SHETLAND JUMPER THERE 
ARE SOME SMOKIES HANGING UP AND 
EVEN A TURF ROOF L. LOVE THIS FENCE 
AND THE FRONT AND SOME TOUGH PLANTS 
THAT CAN COPE WITH IT AND WHO IS 
THIS A REAL SHETLAND PONY HE IS 
GORGEOUS 
AS A GARDENER I'M MORE GORGEOUS INTERESTED IN THIS END L. LOVE THIS 
AN GOOD GIFTS GARDEN SHOWING THE 
SEASIDE WITH THE TIDE BURSTING 
BETWEEN THE ROCKS BUT THEY ARE 
TRYING TO PROMOTE THE FACT THAT IN 
TELEVISION FIFTIES WHEN WOMAN'S OWN 
LOOKED LIKE THAT THE CAR FREE 
YEARS AFTER THE WAR WHEN I WAS A 
LAD I WAS ONLY ONE IT IS ALL 
RIGHT I'M NOT THAT OLD PEOPLE 
LOVE BEING TRANSPORTED SOMEWHERE 
DIFFERENT 
IN TWENTY YARDS WE HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT ALL OVER NOW AND BACK TO SCHOOL I I DIDN'T LIKE IT THE FIRST TIME IF IF YOU HAD A GARDEN LIKE THIS I IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT 
IT IS 
IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN PRIMARY 
SCHOOLS TO SHOW CHILDREN WHERE THE 
PLANTS COME FROM AND WHERE THEIR 
FOOD COMES FROM AND GET THEM 
INTERESTED IN NATURE AND GROWING 
THINGS THEN THEY BECOME MORE 
AWARE AND HAVE A GREATER FEELING 
FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE 
THERE IS A LOT 
OF SCHOOLS GETTING KIDS INVOLVED IN 
GARDENING
