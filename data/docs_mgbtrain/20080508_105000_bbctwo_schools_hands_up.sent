I'M MAD ABOUT THE BOY 
AND I KNOW IT'S STUPID 
TO BE MAD ABOUT THE BOY 
I'M SO ASHAMED OF IT 
BUT MUST ADMIT 
THE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS I'VE HAD 
ABOUT THE BOY 
OOH 
ON THE SILVER SCREEN 
HE MELTS MY FOOLISH HEART 
IN EVERY SINGLE SCENE 
ALTHOUGH I'M QUITE AWARE 
THAT HERE AND THERE ARE TRACES 
OF THE CAD 
ABOUT THE BOY 
I'M FEELING QUITE INSANE 
AND YOUNG AGAIN 
AND ALL BECAUSE I'M MAD 
ABOUT THE BOY 
O. K. EVERYBODY DO YOU KNOW THIS STORY 
DO YOU KNOW THE STORY I WANT MY DINNER 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD STORY 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK I'VE TOLD YOU ALL ENOUGH STORIES 
SO HOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU TAKING TURNS TO TELL A PART OF TODAY'S STORY 
DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST JONATHAN

OFF YOU GO THEN 
THE GIRL TIPPED HER PLATE OVER AND HER KNIFE AND FORK WENT IN THE AIR 
THE QUEEN WHO WAS THE PRINCESS'S MUM LOOKED TO HER AND FROWNED 
YOU MUST SAY PLEASE 
PLEASE SAID THE PRINCESS 
THEN IN CAME THE CHEF 
WITH A PLATE OF SAUSAGE AND CHIPS FOR THE PRINCESS 
AND FISH AND CHIPS FOR THE CAT 
NEXT HE BROUGHT A BIG TRAY OF JELLY FROM THE FRIDGE 
THEN THE PRINCESS JUMPED ABOUT 
AND SHOUTED I NEED THE TOILET 
SHE SQUEEZED HER TOOTHPASTE AND IT SQUIRTED ACROSS THE FLOOR 
AND ALL OVER THE CAT IT WENT UP HIS BACK AND ALL DOWN HIS FACE 
AND BACK ONTO THE FLOOR 
THAT'S RIGHT ALL DOWN HIS FACE 
ISN'T THAT FUNNY 
THE SOLDIER WITH THE POTTY ON HIS HEAD CAME RIDING ON A HOBBY HORSE 
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID OR DID YOU FORGET 
THAT'S RIGHT YOU MUST SAY PLEASE SAID THE SOLDIER 
CAN I HAVE MY POTTY PLEASE CAN I GO TO THE TOILET PLEASE 
SAID THE PRINCESS 
OH LOVELY SAID THE PRINCESS SMILING 
THE SOLDIER AND THE CAT SALUTED HER 
THE NEXT THING THE PRINCESS YELLED AND YELLED AS LOUD AS SHE COULD 
I WANT MY TEDDY BRING MY TEDDY NOW 
THEN THE PRINCESS REMEMBERED TO SAY PLEASE 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID DADDY AND GAVE HER HER TEDDY 
SHE WAS HAPPY AND GAVE TEDDY A HUG 
SHE ASKED HER DADDY 
CAN I GO FOR A WALK WITH MY PRAM PLEASE 
YES YOU CAN AND OFF SHE WENT 
THE PRINCESS THOUGHT WHAT'S UP HERE 
ON TOP OF THE HILL SHE SAW AND SMELT SOME DELICIOUS FOOD 
THERE WAS SPAGHETTI 
PEAS 
CHIPS 
SAUSAGES BREAD SALT AND A DRINK 
IN A DARK CAVE THE PRINCESS COULD SEE A BIG MONSTER 
HE CAME OUT WITH HIS ARMS STRETCHED AND HIS EYES ALL SCRUNCHED UP 
AND GROWLING AT HER SCARY 
THEN HE POINTED AND SAID THAT'S MY DINNER 
OH SAID THE PRINCESS FEELING GUILTY 
THAT'S RIGHT SIMON HE REALLY WANTS HIS DINNER 
THE MONSTER SCREAMS FOR HIS DINNER HE'S ANGRY AND HE STAMPS HIS FEET 
I WANT MY DINNER HE YELLED 
SAY PLEASE SAID THE PRINCESS 
TEDDY SUCKED UP THE SPAGHETTI 
THE MONSTER SAID PLEASE OH HE DOES LOOK SAD 
BUT HE MUST SAY PLEASE 
THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM HIS DINNER 
MM THE SMELL SCRUMMY 
THE MONSTER SNATCHED THE PLATE AND TURNED AWAY 
THE PRINCESS TUGGED AT HIM AND SAID HEY YOU SHOULD SAY THANK YOU 
NOT JUST STORM OFF 
SORRY THE MONSTER SAID THANK YOU 
AND THE PRINCESS SAID THAT'S O. K. THANK YOU TOO AND SHE WENT HOME 
THAT'S RIGHT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER TO SAY THANK YOU TOO 
WELL THAT'S THE END OF OUR STORY TODAY

LIKE WHEN WE NEED TO USE A PENCIL 
WE SHOULD SAY PLEASE COULD I HAVE ONE 
AND WHEN WE HAVE FINISHED WITH IT AND GIVE IT BACK WE SAY WHAT
