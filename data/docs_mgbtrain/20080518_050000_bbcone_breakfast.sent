STILL BEING PULLED ALIVE OUT OF THE 
RUBBLE DAYS AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE ON 
MONDAY SOME RESCUE WORK REMEMBERS 
USING HI TECH EQUIPMENT TO LOCATE 
SURVIVORS OTHERS ARE SIMPLY USING 
THEIR BARE HANDS TO DIG THEM OUT 
AT THE SAME TIME MORE AND MORE WE 
ARE SEEING SCENES OF GRIEF 
UNCONTROLLABLE GRIEF AS BODIES ARE 
BEING BROUGHT OUT FROM THE WRECKAGE 
FAMILIES ARE REALISING THAT THEY 
HAVE LOST A RELATIVE TO THIS 
EARTHQUAKE 
DAN A LOT OF CONCERN EARTHQUAKE NOW ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
DISEASE AND ALSO WORRIES ABOUT 
THESE AFTERSHOCKS HOW HAVE THOSE 
TWO THINGS BEEN AFFECTING PEOPLE 
THAT IS RIGHT ABSOLUTELY OF 
COURSE ESPECIALLY THE AFTERSHOCKS 
AND ALSO BAD WEATHER IN STOM PARTS 
OF THE REGION HERE HAVE BEEN HAVING 
AN AFFECT ON THE AID EFFORT MORE 
AND MORE AID IS GETTING THROUGH 
ALTHOUGH SOME REMOTE AREAS ARE 
STILL NOT GETTING ANY WHERE NEAR 
ENOUGH THE AUTHORITIES NOW 
FOCUSING NOT JUST ON THE IMMEDIATE 
AID BUT ALSO TRYING TO REBUILD 
ROADS RESTORE COMMUNICATION 
SYSTEMS AND GET POWER AND WATER 
SUPPLIES BACK UP AND RUNNING THEY 
ARE TRYING TO SLOWLY HELP THE 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
AFFECTED BY THIS EARTHQUAKE REBUILD 
THEIR LIVES 
DAN WE WILL LEAVE IT 
THERE FOR NOW THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
TIME THIS MORNING FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN AND 
WOMEN HAVE SPENT THE NIGHT WALKING 
THROUGH LONDON IN THEIR UNDERWEAR 
YES THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING PART IN 
A CHARITY MARATHON CALLED MOONWALK 
TO RAISE FUNDS FOR BREAST CANCER 
CHARITIES THE ROUTE SAW BRA CLAD 
ENTRANTS INCLUDING A FEW MAY MOUSE 
FACES DOING A CIRCUIT WHICH BEGAN 
IN HYDE PARK 
THOSE ARE OUR MAIN STORIES THIS 
MORNING GORDON BROWN SAYS SOME M. P.'S 
OWE IT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS TO 
SUPPORT CHANGES TO EMBRYOLOGY LAWS 
WRITING IN THE OBSERVER NEWSPAPER 
HE SAYS STEM CELL RESEARCH IS 
CRUCIAL TO TACKLING DISEASES LIKE 
ALZHEIMER'S AND PARKINSON'S IT'S A 
FREE VOTE IN THE COMMONS THE PRIME 
MINISTER AT LEAST ADMITS HE HAS 
MADE IT CLEAR WHAT HE THINKS M. P.'S 
SHOULD DO 
HE COMES OUT STRONGLY IN 
FAVOUR OF THE MEDICAL ADVANCES 
THERE ARE SO MUCH CONTROVERSY 
THERE ARE THREE MANY AREAS THAT 
HAVE CAUSED FUSS THE IDEA OF 
CREATING HYBRID EMBRYOS WHICH 
INVOLVES COMBINING HUMAN AND ANIMAL 
TISSUE YOU USE HUMAN D. N. A. INJECT IT 
INTO AN ANIMAL EMBRYO TO CREATE 
HYBRID EMBRYO TO CULTIVATE STEM 
CELLS A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT IS 
GOING SOMEWHERE WHERE SCIENTISTS 
MAY NOT DO IT MAY ENABLE THEM TO 
TKWAEL PARKINSON'S AND ALZHEIMER'S 
AND IS WORTH DOING AND SAVIOUR 
SIBLING WHERE BY YOU CREATE AN 
EMBRYONIC CELL AND CULTIVATE THE 
DEPRELS THAT TO TREAT A SIBLING 
WITH A GENETIC DISORDERLET PRIME 
MINISTER SAYS IT COULD SAVE 
CHILDRENS LIVES AND IS WORTH DOING 
THE LAST AREA RELATING TO I. V. F. 
TREATMENT UNDER THE PROPOSALSALS IN 
THIS BILL YOU WOULD NO LONGER HAVE 
TO HAVE A FATHER AS PART OF THE 
PARENTING YOU COULD HAVE ADEQUATE 
PARENTING IN OTHER WORDS THE 
PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT WOULD GET 
RID OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 
LESBIANS AND SINGLE PAERNT HE IS 
IN FAVOUR OF ALL THOSE CHANGES 
THERE IS OPPOSITION TO THEM 
IF HE 
FEELS SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS WHY 
IS IT A FREE VOTE WHAT DOES THAT 
MEAN POLITICALLY 
YOU TEND FIND 
WHERE THERE ARE ISSUES OF 
CONSCIENCE WHERE THERE ARE MATTERS 
WHICH PEOPLE REGARD AS BEYOND THE 
NORMAL PARTY POLITICS SAY ABORTION 
WHICH IS LIKELY TO COME UP AS PART 
OF THIS BILL WHERE THERE ARE 
ISSUES THAT GO YOUND PARTY 
PRINCIPLE POLITICIANS SAY YOU CAN 
VOTE AS YOUR CONSCIENCE DICTATES 
ON THIS MEASURE ALL THREE PARTY 
LEADERS HAVE SAID WE WILL ALLOW OUR 
M. P.'S TO VOTE AS THEY WANT THAT MAKE 
IT IS HARDER TO JUDGE HOW THE VOTES 
WILL GO L. THINK THE RECKONING IS 
BY IN LARGE THESE MEASURES WILL 
STILL GO THROUGH ON ABORTION IT 
IS MUCH LESS CLEAR IT IS POSSIBLE 
YOU COULD SEE REDUCTION IN THE TIME 
LIMIT FOR ABORTION FROM TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY TWO 
WEEKS 
MEANWHILE THE CREWE BY WEEKS ELECTION COMING ON THURSDAY WHAT 
ARE THE POLLS SHOWING FOR THE 
DIFFERENT PARTIES THERE 
CLUTCH OF 
VERY GRIM POLLS IN TODAY'S 
NEWSPAPERS FOR GORDON BROWN THERE 
IS NOTHING GOOD IN THEM AT ALL A 
COUPLE OF POLLS TAKING A NATIONAL 
PICTURE WHICH SUGGESTS THE TORIES 
HAVE SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY POINT LEAD 
OVER LABOUR THE ONE HE WILL LOOK 
AT IS THE ONE IN THE NEWS OF THE 
WORLD WHICH LOOKS AT THE CREWE BY 
ELECTION ON THURSDAY THERE IT 
SUGGESTS AS DID LAST WEEKEND'S 
POLL IN THE MAIL ON SUNDAY THE 
TORIES ARE ON COURSE TO WIN FORTY FIVE PER CENT 
AGAINST THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT FOR LABOUR STILL 
WITHIN THE MARGIN FOR ERROR JUST IT 
SEEMS AS IF THE TORIES ARE ON 
COURSE TO WIN THERE THAT WOULD BE 
A SERIOUS BLOW FOR THE PRIME 
MINISTER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MINISTER INDEED 
THE HEADLINES AS YOU HAVE BEEN 
HEARING GORDON BROWN SAYS 
CONTROVERSIAL NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN 
STEM CELL RESEARCH COULD TRANSFORM 
MILLIONS OF LIVES A BRITISH 
CHARITY HAS WARNED THAT THOUSANDS 
OF CHILDREN IN BURMA WILL DIE FROM 
HUNGER WITHIN WEEKS UNLESS AID 
REACHES THEM SOON 
THIS IS BREAKFAST FROM B. B. C. NEWS 
STILL TO COME THIS MORNING WEDDING 
BLESS AS AUTUMN RAINS BUT WAS THE 
LATEST MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY 
RIGHT TO GIVE UP HER CATHOLIC FAITH 
SO HER HUSBAND CAN STAY IN LINE TO 
THE THRONE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE WEATHER 
NOW MATT IS THERE FOR US NOW 
GOOD MORNING A MUCH BETTER DAY 
TODAY THAN YESTERDAY WITH LESS 
RAIN AROUND BUT IT IS A COLD START 
PARTS OF SCOTLAND IN FACT JUST 
BELOW FREEZING 
THE CLOUD IS CLEARING AWAY AND 
INTRODUCING THE GENERALLY SUNNY 
SKIES FOR THE TIME BEING REMNANTS 
OF CLOUD OVER THE SOUTH EAST STILL 
THIS MORNING BUT BY TEN A M. THAT WILL 
HAVE BEEN BROKEN UP ALLOWING THE 
SUNSHINE THROUGH A FEW SHOWERS 
STILL BRUSHING SOUTHERN PARTS OF 
DEVON AND CORNWALL BUT THAT WILL 
ALSO CLEAR AND THE RAIN OVER 
CARDIGAN BAY AT THE MOMENT WILL 
PUSH OUT TO THE WEST IN THE FRESH 
EASTERLY WIND OVER SCOTLAND CLEAR 
BLUE SKIES THIS MORNING AND 
TEMPERATURES WILL LIFT 
ONE OR TWO SHOWERS HOWEVER OVER 
ABERDEENSHIRE AND PARTS OF NORTHIUM 
BERLAND AND NOT TOO BAD CONDITIONS 
IF YOU'RE DOING THE GREAT NORTH RUN 
WHITE CLOUD WILL START TO BUBBLE UP 
OVER THE SOUTH BLOTTING OUT THE SUN 
FOR ONE OR TWO OF US THIS AFTERNOON 
BUT GENERALLY A DRIER AND BRIGHTER 
DAY THAN YESTERDAY AND TEMPERATURES 
UP TO FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN DEGREES AND IT 
LOOKS LIKE WE SHOULD GET A FULL 
DAY'S PLAY IN AT LORDS A BIT 
CHILLY IN THE BREEZE BUT IN THE 
SUNSHINE NOT BAD AT ALL OVERNIGHT 
THE CLOUD THAT WILL BUILD UP SHOULD 
MELT AWAY AND THERE SHOULD BE CLEAR 
SKIES FOR THE MOST PART WITH A 
CHANCE OF FROSTS IN THE FAR NORTH 
OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AS WELL SO 
WE BEGIN THE WEEK ON A DRY SUNNY 
NOTE BUT NOT THE HEAT OF LAST WEEK 
BUT AFTER THAT SUNNY START MORE 
CLOUD WILL BUBBLE UP AND SPREAD OUT 
TAKING AWAY A BIT OF THE SUNSHINE 
AND PRODUCING ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER 
EASTERN SCOTLAND AND EASTERN 
ENGLAND AS WELL WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING FROM THE NORTH WE'LL STAY 
DRY UNTIL TUESDAY BUT FURTHER 
NORTH ALWAYS A LITTLE CHILL IN THE 
AIR AND A CHILLY START TO EACH DAY 
BURMA'S REGIME HAS BEEN CONDEMNED 
FOR REFUSING TO HELP AID WORKERS IN 
TO HELP THE VICTIMS OF CYCLONE 
NARGIS NARGIS BUT THE B. B. C. HAS MANAGED TO GET SOME 
REPORTERS IN HERE ONE THEIR STORY 
INSIDE BURMA TWO WEEKS AFTER THE 
MASSIVE CYCLONE WE FIND DESPERATE 
SURVIVORS WHO RECEIVE NO AID 
WE ARE STARVING FOR A FEW DAYS GOVERNMENT HELICOPTERS 
FLEW ABOVE US WE WAVED AND CRIED 
FOR HELP BUT IT SEEMS THEY DID NOT 
HEAR US 
THERE IS NO RAIN IN SPAIN 
BARCELONA IS SHIPPING IN WATER 
SUPPLIES AS THE DRAUGHT TAKES HOLD 
AND THE BATTLE FOR THE FUTURE OF 
THE AMAZON 
WELCOME TO REPORTERS IN BURMA TWO 
WEEKS AFTER A CYCLONE KILLED TENS 
OF THOUSANDS THE MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO THUMB ITS 
NOSE AT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
REFUSING TO ALLOW IN FOREIGN RELIEF 
WORKERS TO DELIVER FOOD WATER 
SHELTER AND MEDICINE TO THE 
ESTIMATED TWO MILLION SURVIVORS IN 
DIRE NEED OF HELP THE PART OF THE 
COUNTRY WORST AFFECTED BY THE 
DISASTER IS THE SOUTHERN IRRAWADDY 
DELTA REGION OUR CORRESPONDENT 
DEFIED A GOVERNMENT BAN ON B. B. C. 
REPORTERS AND TRAVELLED THROUGH THE 
DELTA REGION BY BOAT HER REPORT 
CONTAINS SOME STRONG IMAGES 
THE TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION THE 
SURVIVORS ARE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING 
THEY CAN USE 
AT NIGHT WE FOUND SOME OF THEM 
HUDDLED IN THE DARKNESS OF A TEA 
SHOP THERE IS NO SPACE LEFT IN 
REFUGEE CAMPS 
THIS BOY IS THIRTEEN HE ONE ON HIS OWN NOW 
TWO WEEKS AGO HE SAW HOW THE HE 
IS ON HIS OWN NOW TWO WEEKS AGO HE 
SAW HOW THE CYCLONE SWEPT HIS WHOM 
FAMILY AWAY THE NEXT DAY WE TOOK A 
BOAT TO HIS VILLAGE AID WORKERS 
ARE NOT ALLOWED HERE I'VE LOST 
COUNT OF THE BODIES THAT HAVE 
PASSED THEY'RE ALL ALONG THE BANK 
HERE BUT WHAT IS WORSE IS WHAT IS 
HAPPENING TO THE SURVIVORS TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE STRANDED IN 
VILLAGES ALONGSIDE THIS RIVER AND 
THEY ARE GETTING NO HELP AT ALL L. 
SAW NO EVIDENCE OF AID THAT THE 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS TO BE 
DELIVERING DELIVERING THIS IS WHERE YUSUS'S HOUSE STOOD 
HE TOLD ME HOW HE CLUNG ON FOR FOURTEEN 
HOURS AND WAITED FOR THE STORM TO 
COME COME FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE LIVED HERE TWENTY SURVIVED 
THEY ARE NOW LIVING IN THE ONLY 
BUILDING THAT STILL STANDS 
RAIN WATER AND A BIT OF RICE IS ALL 
THEY HAVE 
WE ARE STARVING FOR A FEW DAYS GOVERNMENT HELICOPTERS 
FLEW ABOVE US WE WAVED AND CRIED 
FOR HELP BUT IT SEEMS THEY DID NOT 
HEAR US 
ALONG THE DELTA HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS ARE WAITING ISOLATED AND 
DESPERATE FOR HELP THAT THEY ARE 
SIMPLY NOT GETTING 
SPAIN IS SUFFERING THE WORST 
DRAUGHT IN SIXTY YEARS WITH SOME OF 
THE RESERVOIRS LESS THAN HALF FULL 
MANY CLIMATE SCIENTISTS BELIEVE 
THAT SOME COUNTRIES WILL HAVE TO 
BUS IN WATER WHEN SHORTAGES TAKE 
HOLD AN ORDINARY VESSEL WITH AN 
INCREDIBLY PRECIOUS CARGO THIS WAS 
THE MOMENT THAT BARCELONA BECAME 
THE FIRST MAJOR EUROPEAN CITY TO 
HAVE SHIP SUPPLY IT WITH WATER 
USUALLY IT IS OIL OR CONTAINERS 
THAT ARRIVE HERE BUT BARCELONA 
FINDS ITSELF SO SHORT OF WATER THAT 
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF NEARLY 
TWO HUNDRED DELIVERIES ALL BECAUSE OF 
DROUGHT THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
THIS WAS A VERY DRY YEAR IN TERMS 
OF RAINFALL AND THIS DRAUGHT 
CONTINUES AND TODAY WE ARE IN A 
VERY SERIOUS AND COMPLICATED 
SITUATION 
ACROSSBARS LONIA THE SITUATION IMPACT IS CLEAR THE FAMOUS 
FOUNTAINS HAVE BEEN STOPPED WATER 
RESTRICTIONS ARE IN PLACE THE 
FOUNTAIN NOSELES ARE BONE DRY EVEN 
BEFORE THE FULL HEAT OF THE SUMMER 
PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO GET USED TO 
DRIER CONDITIONS 
WE TRAVELLED INTO THE MOUNTAINS 
ABOVE BARCELONA TO SEE THE SOURCE 
OF THE PROBLEM THIS KEY RESERVOIR 
IS ALARMINGLY LONE YOU CAN SEE 
ALONG THE WATER'S EDGE THE BARE 
STRIPE OF ROCK SHOWING JUST HOW 
MUCH THE WATER LEVEL HAS FALLEN 
THE RESERVOIR HAS NOW JUST EIGHTEEN PER CENT OF 
ITS NORMAL CAPACITY WHERE I'M 
STANDING NOW SHOULD BE UNDER FORTY TO 
FIFTY METRES OF WATER BUT THIS IS 
SPAIN'S DRIEST SEASON ON REGARD 
AND IT MEANS THAT THIS MEDIEVAL 
VILLAGE FLOODED FOR FORTY YEARS HAS 
BECOME EXPOSED ONCE AGAIN IT IS A 
POTENT SYMBOL OF THE SEVERITY OF 
THE WATER CRISIS NOW GRIPPING SPAIN 
THE WATER IS STILL FLOWING BUT 
PEOPLE ARE VERY AWARE THAT THEY MAY 
YET FACE THE THREAT OF RATIONING 
ANNA BLAMES THE POLITICIANS FOR NOT 
TACKLING THE WATER SHORTAGE SOON 
ENOUGH 
SOME PEOPLE SAY O. K. WE ENOUGH AS CITIZENS HAVE DONE ENOUGH NOW 
IT IS TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO 
WORK SO PEOPLE FEEL O. K. IT IS 
DROUGHT AND WE DO WHAT WE CAN BUT 
PLEASE DO YOUR WORK 
SO WHAT ABOUT 
BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON WATER 
THESE UN SOLD SWIMMING POOLS STAND 
LIKE TOMB STONES SALES HAVE 
CRASHED BECAUSE POOLS CANNOT BE 
FILLED FROM NORMAL SUPPLIES AND 
TOURISM COULD CRASH 
ON BODE THE SCIENTISTS TEST THE 
WATER BUT THE ARRIVAL OF THIS SHIP 
REVEALS HOW RADICALLY EVEN THE MOST 
PROSPEROUS CITIES HAVE TO ADEPT 
AN OPERATION TO COMBAT THE 
DEFORESTATION OF BRAZIL'S AMAZON 
RAINFOREST IS NOW IN FULL SWING 
POLICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTORS 
ARE SEIZING LARGE AMOUNTS OF 
ILLEGAL WOOD AND ISSUING MILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS IN FINES BUT CRITICS 
SAY THESE PENALTIES ARE RARELY PAID 
AND THAT THE OPERATIONS FLAWED 
WE'VE BEEN TO LOOK AT OPERATION ARC 
OF FIRE THE FRONTLINE IN THE FIGHT 
AGAINST DEFORESTATION IN THE AMAZON 
A CONVOY OF POLICE AND OFFICIALS 
BACKED BUP I SOLDIERS SETS OFF INTO 
THE HEART OF THE RAINFOREST 
THIS IS OPERATION ARC OF FIRE 
PERHAPS THE MOST DETERMINED EFFORTS 
OF THE BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES TO 
CLAMP DOWN ON ILLEGAL LOGGING 
TEARING DOWN CASHING YOL FURNACES 
THAT HAVE BEEN CHARACTERAL FURNSS 
THAT HAVE BEEN PUT UP BUT SOME SAY 
IT THREATENS THEIR LIVELIHOOD 
THEY ARE DESTROYING THE OFFENCE IN THE SAME WAY THEY 
HAVE WITH OTHERS THIS CAUSES MANY 
PEOPLE TO BE UNEMPLOYED WE ARE 
SUFFERING BUT WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH 
IT AT 
THE NEARBY LOGGING FIRM WOOD ITAT FROM THE AMAZON IS MOVED AROUND THE 
YARD AT A FURIOUS PACE ALMOST FORTY FIVE PER CENT 
IN ONE AREA HAS ALREADY BEEN 
CLEARED CLEARED ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTORS ARE TRYING 
TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THIS COMPANY 
HAS BREACHED THE LAW BY CUTTING 
DOWN ALL OF THESE TREES ALREADY 
OPERATION ARC OF FIRE HAS RECOVERED 
ENOUGH ILLEGAL WOOD TO COVER TWENTY FIVE 
LORRIES LORRIES BUT THE WORRY IS THAT WHEN THE 
POLICE AND AUTHORITIES LEAVE 
DEFORESTATION WILL START TO RISE 
AGAIN BUT THE POLICE INSIST THEY 
ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE 
WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING WITH US THAT ARE SPECIALLY 
TRAINED FOR THE AREA ENVIRONMENTAL 
SPECIALISTS AND EXPERTS IN FORESTRY 
OUR RESOURCES ARE STILL LIMITED 
BUT POWER IS A HUGE STATE 
DEFORESTATION HAS LEFT ITS MARK ALL 
OVER THE AMAZON WITH CATTLE GRAZING 
WHERE ONCE TREES STOOD 
WEAK IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO 
COLLECT THE FINES ISSUED AGAINST 
THE ILLEGAL DEFORESTATION AND THE 
SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE 
CONTINUE TO OCCUPY AND GRAB THE 
FORESTS IN THOSE AREAS 
BUT AT THIS 
SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE LEARNING A NEW 
APPROACH TO THE ENVIRONMENT 
WE KNOW WE HAVE TO PRESERVE THE AMAZON AND NOT CHOP 
DOWN THE TREES WE HAVE TO LOOK 
AFTER THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IF WE 
DON'T THE ANIMALS WILL DIE TOO 
A NEW GENERATION GROWING UP IN THE 
AMAZON SEEMS WELL AWARE OF THE 
ENORMOUS VALUE OF THE RAINFOREST 
IT WILL BE THEIR CHANCE TOON TO TRY 
TO PRESERVE WHAT STILL REMAINS 
SOON TO TRY TO PRESERVE WHAT STILL 
REMAINS REMAINS THAT'S ALL FROM REPORTERS FOR THIS 
WEEK GOODBYE FOR NOW

DEFENCE OF THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH 
FOR ANIMAL HUMAN HYBRID EMBRYO 
WHICH SOME PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM 
WITH 
WITH HE BACK IT IS ABSOLUTELY HE 
IS ENCOURAGING OTHER M. P.'S TO DO THE 
SAME PLENTY OF PHOTOGRAPH FROM THE 
ROYAL WEDDING YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 
ACROSS ALL THE PAPERS SUNDAY 
TELEGRAPH THOUSANDS OF BRITISH 
WOMEN IT REPORTS HAVE HAD FOUR OR 
MORE ABORPGSS INCLUDING DOZENS WHO

POSSIBILITY THERE MAY A. B. CURE 
WITHIN SIGHT FOR MRSA BREAK 
THROUGH THEY ARE SAYING BY BRITISH 
RESEARCHERS POSSIBLE COULD SAVE 
SIXTEEN HUNDRED LIVES A YEAR IF IT'S EFFECTIVE 
TRYING TO LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE 
OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH BRITAIN'S 
SHOPPERS WILL ENJOY THE BEST SALES 
FOR A DECADE AS STORES BATTLE ONE 
OF THE TOUGHEST PERIODS IN RETAIL 
HISTORY SUNDAY TIMES ALSO HAVING 
THE BIG PICTURE SPREAD THERE OF THE 
ROYAL WEDDING YESTERDAY 
STORY THERE M. I FIVE LINKED TO THE MAX 
MOSLE YE SEX SCANDAL THE FORMULA ONE 
RACING CHIEF A SUGGESTION THERE 
WAS A LINK WITH M. I FIVE INVOLVED IN 
THAT SCANDAL 
HE IS NOT EXACTLY LED 
A QUIET LIFE SURVIVING SNAKES AND 
NAZIS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AFTER HIS 
LAST ADVENTURES IDGEIDGE IS BACK 
IDGEIDGE AND THE KING DOOM OF THE 
CRYSTAL SKULL PREMIERS TONIGHT THE 
FILM'S OSCAR WINNING DIRECTOR 
SPIELBERG HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO OUR 
ARTS CORRESPONDENT PICKING UP 
WHERE HE LEFT OFF NINETEEN YEARS AGO 
INDIE IS BACK IN THE FILM ITSELF 
THERE IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HOW 
MUCH TIME HAS PASSED 
THIS AIN'T 
GOING TO BE EASY 
NOT AS EASY AS IT 
USED TO BE 
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT 
AS A GAMBLE TO BE FAIR EVERY 
MOVIE I'VE MADE IS A GAMBLE THIS 
WAS SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC 
REALLY ASKED ME AND HARRISON AND 
GEORGE AND ALL OF THE CAST MEMBERS 
WHO WERE IN THE MOVIE WERE ALWAYS 
ASKED NOT OFTEN BUT AUTUMN THE 
TIME WHEN IS IDGEIDGE COMELING 
BACK THIS WAS FINAMLY WHAT WE 
NEEDED TO DO TO BASICALLY SATISFY I 
THINK A NEED TO BRING THE CHARACTER 
BACK IT WAS SOMETHING HARRISON 
WANTED 
TELL ME ABOUT THE AUDIENCE WANTED A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO THE FILM 
WILL BE AIMED AT THIS TIME WERE NOT 
EVEN BORN WHEN THE HEIGHT OF THE 
FIRST THREE FILMS 
WE DON'T FEEL 
LIKE THERE HAS BEEN ANY KIND OF 
TIME PASSAGE BECAUSE INDIANA JONES 
HAS BEEN AS FAR AWAY FROM AUDIENCES 
AS BASICALLY THE PUSH OF THE BUTTON 
OR THE SLIPPING OF A CASSETTE INTO 
A PLAYER IT IS AN OLD FASHIONED 
MOVIE BECAUSE THE FIRST THREE FILMS 
WERE OLD FASHIONED L. THOUGHT I WAS 
MAKING A B. MOVIE LIKE OLD MOVIES 
CHARLTON HESTON USED TO BE IN 
SEAHAWK THOSE WERE THEICONIC OLD B. 
MOVIES I LOVED GROWING UP WATCHING 
THEM ON TELEVISION I'M NOT THAT 
OLD OLD BUT NOT THAT OLD SO I 
THINK THAT I NEEDED TO MOD THEL 
MOVIE TO BECOME A KISSING COUSIN 
WITH THE FIRST THREE L. DIDN'T WANT 
THIS TO BE THE BORNE ULTIMATUM OF 
THE NEW GENERATION OF INDIANA JONES 
THAT WASN'T THE POINT HERE 
IT WILL 
A. B. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DOES IT 
MATTER IF IT'S A CRITICAL SUCCESS 
IT MATTERS TO ME THAT PEOPLE GET IT 
ENJOY IT AND GIVE IT BIRTH YOU 
KNOW TOUCHING ANY ONE OF THE OTHER 
THREE MOVIES IN ANY ORDER THEY WANT 
TO PLACE IT FIRST LAST MIDDLE IT 
DOESN'T MATTER 
THE HEADLINES GORDON BROWN SAYS 
CONTROVERSIAL NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN 
STEM CELL RESEARCH DEBATED BY M. P.'S 
TOMORROW COULD TRANSFORM MILLIONS 
OF LIVES A BRITISH CHARITY HAS 
WARNED THAT THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN 
IN BURMA WILL DIE FROM HUNGER 
WITHIN WEEKS UNLESS AID REACHES 
THEM SOON THE WEATHER NOW WITH MATT 
GOOD MORNING AFTER THE GREY SKIES 
MOST OF US HAD YESTERDAY PLENTY OF 
SUNSHINE AROUND TODAY BUT DO BE 
WARNED IT IS ON THE FRESH SIDE OUT 
THERE THIS MORNING TEMPERATURES IN 
SCOTLAND FOR INSTANCE JUST BELOW 
FREEZING THE REASON FOR THAT IS 
BECAUSE THE WINDS ARE PUSHING DOWN 
FROM THE NORTH THEY ARE CLEARING 
AWAY YESTERDAY'S CLOUD A LITTLE 
LINGERING IN THE SOUTH OF THE 
COUNTRY BUT THEY ARE ON THE WAY 
OUT OUT ONE OR TWO SHOWERS FOR THE CHANNEL 
ISLANDS AND CLOSE TO SOUTHERN PARTS 
OF DEVON AND CORNWALL BUT THEY 
WILL CLEAR AND THE SKIES WILL 
BRIGHTEN THE RAIN AT THE MOMENT IN 
CARDIGAN BAY IN WALES WILL PUSH OUT 
TO THE WEST ON THE EASTERLY BREEZE 
AND CLEAR SKIES FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND PARTICULARLY ALONG THE 
NORTH COAST IN SCOTLAND CHILLY 
START BUT TEMPERATURES WILL 
RECOVER BY TEN A M. BUT MAYBE A FEW 
SHOWERS IN ABERDEENSHIRE AND ALONG 
THE NORTHIUMLAND BORDER 
AND IT WILL REMAIN SUNNY AND DRY 
FOR MUCH OF THE DAY WITH THE RAIN 
CLEARING FROM THE SOUTH 
A LITTLE MORE CLOUD HOWEVER WILL 
BUBBLE UP THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND 
THAT WILL BLOT OUT THE SUNSHINE ON 
OCCASIONS OCCASIONS TEMPERATURES WILL PEAK AT SIXTEEN 
DEGREES AND AT LORDS A FULL DAY'S 
WORTH OF CRICKET IN STORE 
OVERNIGHT MUCH OF THE CLOUD WILL 
DISTINCT GRATE AWAY AND CLEAR 
SKIES WILL DEVELOP OVER MUCH OF THE 
U. K. WITH A CHILLY NIGHT IN THE 
SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY AND IN WALES 
AND A RISK OF FURTHER FROSTS IN THE 
NORTH OF THE COUNTRY AND SCOTLAND 
SO GARDENERS BE WARNED 
ON MONDAY AFTER A SUNNY START THAT 
WE SHOULD ALL SEE THE CLOUD WILL 
BUILD UP DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 
THE MORNING AND SPREAD OUT A LITTLE 
BIT PRODUCING ONE OR TWO SHOWERS 
ACROSS SCOTLAND BUTENINGS 
ESSENTIALLY IT SHOULD BE A DRY DAY 
TEMPERATURES AROUND FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN 
DEGREES WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
YES THERE WILL BE CHILLY STARTS TO 
THE DAY BUT TEMPERATURES WILL 
RECOVER A LITTLE BIT PARTICULARLY 
IN THE SOUTH 
GOODBYE TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND 
HELLO TO A RUMOURED HALF A MILLION 
POUNDS POUNDS AUTUMN KELLY APPARENTLY GAVE UP 
HER FAITH YESTERDAY IN ORDER TO 
MARRY PETER PHILLIPS WAS THE BRIDE 
RIGHT TO PUT ASIDE HER RELIGIOUS 
BELIEFS SO THAT HE COULD REMAIN 
ELEVENTH IN LINE TO THE THRONE 
WITH US IS MELANIE MCDONAGH WHERE 
DO YOU STAND ON THIS 
I THINK THE 
LIKELIHOOD OF PETER PHILLIPS 
GAINING THE THRONE IS REMOTE SO I 
THINK IT WAS A LOT FOR AUTUMN KELLY 
TO GIVE UP HER RELIGION THAT IS 
ASSUMING THAT SHE DID 
SO YOU'RE 
SAYING IT WAS AN ACT OF SELFISHMENT 
AND AN EXTRAORDINARY ACT OF SELF 
ADVANCEMENT ON HER PART L. WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS EXTREMELY 
UNLIKELY THAT PEOPLE PUT PRESSURE 
ON THIS GIRL TO GIVE UP HER 
RELIGION IN ORDER TO MARRY PETER 
PHILLIPS IT WAS A PIECE OF UPWARD 
MOBILITY SHE HAD MOVED ON FROM 
YOUR BACKGROUND AND THEREFORE MOVED 
ON FROM HER RELIGION IN ORDER TO 
FIT IN WITH THE FAMILY OF THE MAN 
SHE HAD MARRIED 
ALTHOUGH IF HE 
DOES WANT TO STAY IN LINE TO THE 
THRONE IT DOES SAY ENSHRINED IN 
THE LAW THAT HE CANNOT MARRY A 
CATHOLIC IF HE WANTS TO REMAIN IN 
LINE TO THE THRONE AND I THINK IT 
SHOCKED A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WE 
STILL HAVE A LAW LIKE THIS 
YES IT 
MIGHT MAKE SENSE IN TERMS OF KATE 
MIDDLETON BECAUSE SHE COULD 
POSSIBLY MARRY ONE DAY A MAN WHO 
MIGHT ONE DAY BECOME THE HEAD OF 
THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND UNDER 
KATH LOLISM IT IS USUAL 
CATHOLICISM IS IT IS USUAL THAT IN 
A MIXED MARRIAGE THE CHILDREN ARE 
BROUGHT UP CATHOLIC SO THAT WOULD 
MAKE SENSE IF SHE MARRYS THE MAN 
WHO COULD POSSIBLY BECOME THE KING 
OF ENGLAND BUT WITH THE FIRST IN 
LINE TO THE THRONE IT SEEMS 
BIZARRE 
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BIZARRE SAY IT IS HER BUSINESS 
WELL I'M 
AFRAID IN TERMS OF ANYTHING TO DO 
WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY IT IS 
ANYTHING BUT A PRIVATE AFFAIR HER 
WEDDING WAS SHARED WITH HOW MANY 
MILLION HELLO READERS SO THE VERY 
NOTION THAT THIS WAS PRIVATE IS 
NONSENSICAL BECAUSE THERE WAS 
INDEED AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO LET IT 
BE DOWN THAT SHE HAD INDEED BEEN 
RECEIVED INTO THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
BY THE DEAN OF WINDSOR SO SHE IS 
SIMPLY ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC 
WHO HAS TAKEN A PRIVATE DECISION TO 
CONVERT TO HER HUSBAND'S RELIGION 
AND THIS IS INTERESTING IN THE WAKE 
OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH TONY BLAIR 
WHO WAS AN ANGLICAN RIGHT UP TO THE 
MOMENT HE LEFT OFFICE AND THEN 
CONVERTED TO CATHOLICISM 
YES AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC IF HE HAD 
BECOME A CATHOLIC WHILE HE WAS 
PRIME MINISTER GIVEN WHAT COULD BE 
CALLED OPPOSITION IN THE LABOUR 
PARTY BUT HE WANTED TO FIT INTO 
THE FAMILY INTO WHICH HE HAD 
MARRIED AND REGARDED IT THE FAITH 
OF HER FAMILY 
AND ON THE TECHNICAL 
SIDE SHE COULD HAVE REMAINED A 
CATHOLIC AND THE SERVICE COULD HAVE 
GONE AHEAD IN THE CHURCH WHERE IT 
WAS INDEED 
THAT COULD HAVE ALL WAS INDEED BEEN SORTED 
YES THERE IS NO 
ELEMENT OF A MARRIAGE SERVICE THAT 
IS SPECIFICALLY ANGLICAN THAT IS 
TO SAY THERE IS NOTHING IN IT THAT 
COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR A CATHOLIC 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE COMMUNION 
FOR INSTANCE COMMUNION IS A MATTER 
OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO 
FAITHS SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
POSSIBLE FOR HER TO HAVE THE LOVELY 
WEDDING SHE DID HAVE AND SUCHLY 
HAVE THE CATHOLIC PRIEST AS PART OF 
THE AND SIMPLY HAVE THE 
CATHOLIC PRIEST AS PART OF THE 
SERVICE TO MAKE IT TWO FAITHS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL BE 
TALKING ABOUT IT LATER AS WELL BUT 
FOR NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO 
WAS AUTUMN KELLY PLAIN SENSIBLE TO 
SHARE HER HUSBAND'S FAITH WE'LL BE 
DISCUSSING IT A BIT MORE BUT DO 
GET IN TOUCH US IT IS THE SORT OF 
THING THAT WILL GET PEOPLE TALKING 
NOW ON BREAKFAST BRAS BULLOCKS

THEY NEED URGENT MEDICAL TREATMENT 
THE FOOTAGE YOU SHOT YOURSELF WHAT 
IS HAPPENING HERE SNFRPBLT THESE 
ARE PEOPLE SHELTERING A LOT OF 
PEOPLE HAVE MOVED FROM LOW LYING 
ISLANDS INTO THE TOWN OF LAPUTTA 
THERE IS A LOT OF TEMPLES IN THE 
TOWNS THERE THESE ARE PEOPLE 
SHELTERING IN THE TEMPLE COMPOUND 
THESE PEOPLE HAVEN'T YET BEEN GIVEN 
TENTS THERE ARE TENTED SETTLEMENTS 
THERE THEY ARE SHELTERING UNDER 
PLASTIC SHEETING THERE WERE ABOUT 
TWELVE DEEP IN SOME OF THESE AREA THERE 
IS THE HARD THING FOR PEOPLE IS 
THE MONSOON RAINS WHICH HAVE HIT 
HARD IN THE PAST WEEK L. WAS THERE 
IT WAS RAINING FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN 
THOSE CONDITIONS HEALTH CONDITIONS 
SUCH AS PNEUMONIA BECAUSE OF THE 
SHEER AMOUNT OF WATER EVERYWHERE 
ACUTE DIARRHOEA ARE POSING REAL 
RISKS TO PEOPLE 
WHAT FACILITIES DO 
THEY HAVE IF ALL THEY ARE DOING IS 
SHELTERING UNDER CANVASS 
IN THE 
TOWNS PEOPLE ARE GETTING FOOD RICE 
IS BEING DISTRIBUTED PEOPLE ARE 
BEING MOVED FROM WHERE THEY ARE 
SHELTERING ON PAVEMENTS OR 
BUILDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED 
THEY ARE BEING MOVED INTO MORE 
ESTABLISHED CAMPS SOME ARE BEING 
MOVED OUT OUT OF THE CYCLONE 
AFFECTED AREA ALTOGETHER THE THE EXTRAORDINARY THING OF COURSE IS 
THAT BURMA HAS BEEN VERY 
RESTRICTIVE ABOUT WHO HAS BEEN 
ALLOWED IN AT WHAT STAGE WAS 
MERLIN ALLOWED IN AND HOW MANY 
PEOPLE HAVE YOU GOT IN HOW MANY 
PEOPLE WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE IN 
GIVE US AN IDEA OF YOUR IDEAL AID 
OPERATION AND WHAT YOU ARE HAVING 
TO WORK WITH AT THE MOMENT MERLIN MERLIN IS UNIQUE WE HAD A PLO GRAM RUNNING 
FROM THE IRRAWADDY DELTA SO WE WERE 
THERE WHEN THE STORM STRUCK 
IT IS A VERY UNIQUE COUNTRY TO WORK 
IN EVERYTHING IS DONE UNDER 
PERMISSIONS AND PERMITS SORRY SORRY JUST TAKE US THROUGH THIS PICTURE 
WE ARE LOOKING AT NOW THIS LITTLE 
BOY HAS BEEN VERY BADLY INJURED BY 
THE LOOK OF IT 
YEAH A GIRL A 
YOUNG WOMAN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD THIS IS 
TYPICAL SHE SUSTAINED THIS INJURY 
IN THE STORM DEBRIS FLYING 
EVERYWHERE SHE WAS HIT IN THE HEAD 
WE SEE MANY INJURIES LIKE THIS WAS 
PATCHED UP HASTILY IMMEDIATELY 
AFTERWARDS AFTERWARDS THE WOUND HAS BECOME INFECTED IT 
WAS A DEEP WOUND INTO HER HEAD 
THOSE WOUNDS BECOME LIFE 
THREATENING VERY QUICKLY WE HAVE 
MOVED YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT 
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STAFF 
WE HAVE A SMALL NUMBER OF BRITISH 
STAFF AND OTHER INTERNATIONALS 
MAINLY WORKING IN THE CAPITAL WE 
ARE RECRUITING AND FINDING DOCTORS 
LOCALLY THAT HAVE THE RIGHT SKILLS 
GETTING THEM DOWN INTO THE DISASTER 
AREA GIVING THEM THE TRAINING THEY 
NEED TO HELP THESE PEOPLE YOUR YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES THEN IS A POSITIVE ONE 
BECAUSE YOU HAD THE LINK IN THE 
COUNTRY PREVIOUSLY 
IT HAS 
CERTAINLY BEEN MORE POSITIVE THAN 
MANY OTHER ORGANISATIONS OVERALL 
CERTAINLY WE WOULD LIKE MORE ACCESS 
WE WOULD LIKE TO GET MORE 
INTERNATIONAL STAFF THERE WHAT WE 
DO WE DO WHAT WE CAN WE WORK IN 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO GET AS MUCH 
AID AS WE CAN TO PEOPLE L. WOULD 
REALLY LIKE TO EMPHASISE THAT AID 
IS GETTING THROUGH AID IS GETTING 
THROUGH FROM THIS COUNTRY AND FROM 
ORGANISATIONS IN THE D. E. C. 
I THINK 
WE CAN SEE PICTURES OF AID BEING 
UNLOADED NOW L. MEAN THIS IS THE 
STUFF THAT IS SO V. I. E. T. FIFTY EIGHT ISN'T IT 
FOR SO MANY AID AGENCIES BEING HELD 
UP ON THE BORDER NOT GETTING 
THROUGH 
THOSE PICTURES SHOW THAT THROUGH IS ENOUGH MEDICINES FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PEOPLE THAT ARRIVED ON THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON AFTERNOON THAT ACTUALLY CLEARED STRAIGHT 
THROUGH THE AIRPORT AND STRAIGHT 
INTO OUR DEB OWE THAT IS OUT IN 
THE DISASTER ZONE IN THAT TOWN 
LAPUTTA RIGHT NOW 
IMPORTANT FOR 
YOU HAVE COME BACK TO THE U. K. TO 
SPREAD THE WORD AND SHOW THE IMAGES 
DO YOU GO BACK IN HOW DOES THAT 
WORK 
IN THESE SITUATIONS WE HAVE A WORK CHAOTIC TEAM OF PEOPLE MOVING IN 
AND OUT OF THE ZONE SORTING OUT 
SUPPLIES IN THE U. K. AND IN OTHER 
PLACES IN EUROPE 
THE EXPERTS THAT WE NEED IN COUNTRY 
ARE MOVING IN AND OUT AND AROUND 
ALL THE TIME SO WHO KNOWS WHERE 
ONE'S MOVEMENTS WILL BE IN THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS 
WE WILL TALK TO YOU IN AN 
HOUR'S TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR COMING IN AND SHARING THOSE 
PICTURES WITH US 
MERLIN IS AN UP BRAILLEIA 
ORGANISATION OPERATING FOR AID 
AGENCIES IN BURMA AND IF YOU WOULD 
LIKE TO DONATE TO THEIR WORK THIS 
IS THE NUMBER 
UMBRELLA 
YOU'RE WATCHING BREAKFAST 
THE HEADLINES GORDON BROWN'S SAYS 
CONTROVERSIAL NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN 
STEM CELL RESEARCH DEBATED BY M. P.'S 
TOMORROW COULD TRANSFORM MILLIONS 
OF LIVES THOUSANDS OF CLINCH IN 
BURMA WILL DIE FROM HUNGER WITHIN 
WEEKS UNLESS AID REACHES THEM SOON 
AND STILL TO COME ALL CHANGE 
PLEASE WHY YOUR NEXT TICKET TO 
RIDE COULD BE A WHOLE LOT SIMPLER 
ON THE RAILWAYS AND BEFORE THAT THE WEATHER 
GOOD MORNING A MUCH BRIGHTER DAY 
FOR ALL OF US COMPARED TO YESTERDAY 
BUT A WORD OF WARNING IT IS ON THE 
FRESH SIDE OUT THERE THIS MORNING 
I FELT THE CHILL IN THE AIR AS I 
LEFT MY HOUSE AND HERE ARE SOME OF 
THE CURRENT TEMPERATURES 
ONE OR TWO SPOTS ACROSS SCOTLAND 
ARE BELOW FREEZING AT THE MOMENT 
BUT THAT WILL LIFT UNDER THE SUNNY 
SKIES THIS MORNING ONE OR TWO 
SHOWERS IN THE NORTH EAST AND ALONG 
THE BORDERS ON THE FRESH NORTH 
EASTERLY BREEZE BUT IT IS LOOKING 
GOOD ELSEWHERE AND LOOKING GOOD 
FOR THE GREAT MANCHESTER TEN 
KILOMETRE RUN AND ANY OTHER CLOUD 
OVER THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY WILL 
CONTINUE TO BREAK UP AND DISPERSE 
AND A FOU SHOWERS STILL OVER THE 
SOUTH OF DEVON FEW SHOWERS STILL 
OVER THE SOUTH OF DEVON AND 
CORNWALL BUT THEY WILL BE PUSHED 
AWAY LATER ON TOO AND IT WILL BE A 
FINE DAY FOR MOST OF US EVEN THE 
RAIN ACROSS THE SOUTH AND THE WEST 
OF WALES WILL QUICKLY THIN DURING 
THE MORNING AND THE SUNSHINE WILL 
BREAK THROUGH HOWEVER WHITE 
FLUFFY CLOUD WILL BUBBLE UP 
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON BUT 
TEMPERATURES SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD 
IT WON'T BE CLEAR BLUE SKIES 
THROUGHOUT AT LORDS TODAY BUT A 
FULL DAY'S WORTH OF PLAY IS IN 
PROSPECT THIS EVENING ANY CLOUD 
THAT FORMS WILL DISINTEGRATE AWAY 
AND IT SHOULD BE A DRY AND CLEAR 
NIGHT FOR THE MOST PART BUT STILL 
THE WINDS COMING IN FROM A 
NORTHERLY DIRECTION SO IT WILL BE 
A CHILLY NIGHT 
ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND AND 
NORTHERN IRELAND THERE COULD BE A 
GRASS FROST IN PLACES SO MONDAY IS 
A COLD START BUT IT SHOULD BE A 
LOVELY SUNNY DAY BEFORE THE CLOUD 
BUBBLES UP DURING THE AFTERNOON AND 
SPREADS OUT MORE WIDELY DURING THE 
SECOND HALF OF THE DAY BUT MOST OF 
US WILL HAVE A DRY DAY AND 
TEMPERATURES SIMILAR TO TODAY 
AROUND TWELVE TO SIXTEEN DEGREES ON TUESDAY 
HIGH PRESSURE IS IN CHARGE SO IT 
WILL BE SUNNY BUT MORE CLOUD BY 
THE AFTERNOON BUT OVERNIGHT IT 
COULD BE CHILLY WITH POSSIBLY EVEN 
A GRASS FROST OR AN AIR FROST 
OVERNIGHT OVERNIGHT WE ALL LIKE A CHEAP DEAL BUT 
SOMETIMES GETTING A CHEAP RAIL 
TICKET WAS MORE HASSLE THAN IT IS 
WORTH RAIL COMPANIES SAY THEY'VE 
LISTENED TO THEIR PASSENGERS AND 
NOW THERE IS JUST ONE TICKET FOR 
ALL JOURNEY CATT HOBBS JOINS US 
NOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT 
THERE WILL 
BE THREE TYPES OF TICKETS ADVANCED 
OFFPEAK AND PEAK TIMES BUT THE 
REAL COST OF AIR FARES HAS RISEN IN 
THE PAST TEN YEARS AND WE'RE TRYING 
TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE AND REDUCE 
CARBON EMISSIONS WE NEED CHEAPER 
RAIL FARES SO IT IS GOOD THAT THE 
TICKETS ARE SIXLER BUT THEY NEED 
TO COME DOWN IN PRICE 
SO YOU'RE 
SAYING THEY'RE ADDRESSING THE WRONG 
ISSUE 
THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY CAN ISSUE BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS REDUCING 
THEIR INVESTMENT IN THE RAILWAYS SO 
IT MEANS FARES ARE GETTING MORE 
EXPENSIVE AND THEY WILL STILL SO 
WHILST THE COSTS OF GOING BY PLANE 
AND DRIVING ARE GOING DOWN THE 
COST OF GOING BY TRAIN IS GOING UP 
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM WE NEED TO 
TACKLE WE NEED TO TACKLE THESE 
ISSUES AND THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO 
MAKE TRAVELLING BY TRAIN THE EASY 
CHOICE FOR PEOPLE 
I WOULD QUESTION 
WHEN YOU SAY THAT CAR TRAVEL IS 
CHEAPER IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING 
MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS ABOUT 
THIS ISSUE OF TRAIN COMPANIES NOT 
OFFERING YOU THE CHEAPEST TICKET 
SOMETIMES TWO SINGLES ARE CHEAPER 
THAN A RETURN AND IF YOU DON'T 
KNOW YOUR OWN WAY AROUND IT YOU 
END UP PAYING MORE THAN YOU NEED TO 
IS THIS GOING TO ADDRESS THAT IT IT WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TICKETS 
AVAILABLE SO IT WILL REDUCE THE 
NUMBER OF NAMES AND THE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS WILL BE STREAMLINED SO 
IT WILL BE SLIGHTLY LESS 
COMPLICATED BUT IT IS STILL THE 
CASE THAT TO GET AN ADVANCE TICKET 
YOU HAVE TO BOOK MONTHS IN VANS AND 
PEOPLE CAN'T ALWAYS DO THAT WE 
NEED A WALKON RAILWAY WHERE PEOPLE 
TURN UP AT THE STATION AND GO AND 
AT THE MOMENT WE DON'T HAVE THAT 
AND ONE OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS IS 
THE CHARGE FOR CHAINING OR 
CANCELLING THE TICKET HOW IS THAT 
WORKING 
THEY'RE STREAMLINING THE WORKING TICKETS SO THEY'LL SLIGHTLY CHANGE 
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AROUND 
THAT BUT IT IS NOT A BIG ISSUE 
ESSENTIALLY THIS IS A COSMETIC 
CHANGE IT WILL MAKE PASSENGERS 
IT WILL GIVE PASSENGERS LESS 
CHOICES FOUR THEY BOOK THEIR TICKETS 
BUT IT IS NOT REALLY CHANGING THE 
COST IT IS NOT REALLY MAKING ANY 
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND THAT'S 
WHERE GOVERNMENT COMES IN THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE 
TIME TO LOOK AT THE SUNDAY PAPERS 
AND KEVIN MAGUIRE JOINS US GOOD 
MORNING 
GOOD MORNING 
HOW ARE YOU MORNING VERY WELL THANK YOU 
MAKE SURE YOU 
DON'T CALL HIM SWEETY OR DARLING 
I'VE NEVER BEEN CALLED SWEETY I 
MUST ADMIT BUT PLEASE FEEL FREE 
NOW THE MAIL FIRST OF ALL THEY 
HAVE A PHOTO FROM THE WEDDING BUT 
THEIR MAIN CLAIM IS THAT PRINCE 
HARRY AND PRINCE WILLIAM TOOK PART 
IN A RECKLESS ONE HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR CAR 
RIDE TO GET TO A NIGHTCLUB AND 
THIS PAPER SAYS THAT THE SUMMER 
SALES WILL BE THE BEST EVER 
BECAUSE OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
PROBLEMS PROBLEMS AND THE MIRROR SAYS THAT NO ONE IS 
GOING TO VISIT THIS CELEBRITY IN 
PRISON AND THIS HAS A PICTURE OF 
THE ROYAL WEDDING AND AN ARTICLE 
SAYING THAT THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ARE 
HAVING FOUR ABORTIONS AND SOME EVEN 
MORE AND SOME WOMEN HAVE UNDERGONE 
SIX ABORTIONS BY THE AGE OF ZERO AND 
THE INDEPENDENT HAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF 
A VICTORIOUS PORTSMOUTH SUPPORTER 
BUT THEIR MAIN STORY IS THAT A CURE 
FOR MRSA APPEARS TO BE IN GRASP 
THEY SAY KEVIN WHERE ARE YOU 
STARTING 
IN THE OBSERVER AND STARTING GORDON BROWN'S PASSIONATE PLEA FOR 
STEM CELL RESEARCH WHICH GORDON 
BROWN SAYS COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE'S LIVES BUT 
WHAT HE DOES NOT SAY WHICH MUST BE 
IN THE BACK OF HIS MIND IS CYSTIC 
FIBROSIS WHICH HIS SON FRASER 
HAS AND HE COULD DIE WITHOUT THIS 
RESEARCH 
AND CLEARLY THAT WILL RESEARCH HAVE AN EFFECT ON HIS JUDGMENT ON 
THE ISSUE AND THAT'S PERFECTLY 
REASONABLE THESE ARE VERY PERSONAL 
DECISIONS IN A WAY 
THEY ARE HE 
WAS IN FAVOUR BEFORE BUT I'M SURE 
HIS COMMITMENT MUST BE REDOUBLED 
BECAUSE OF HIS OWN POSITION YOU 
WOULDN'T BE HUMAN IF THAT WASN'T 
THE CASE AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY GOING 
TO BE CLEARLY CONTROVERSIAL A LOT 
OF CATHOLIC M. P.'S ARE SAYING THEY ARE 
AGAINST IT IN PRINCIPLE INCLUDING 
SOME MEMBERS OF HIS CABINET THE 
TRANSPORT SECRETARY RUTH KELLY 
AND DES BROWNE L. THINK MOST PEOPLE 
WILL BACK IT BUT YOU COULD ALL 
HAVE A CASE TO ARGUE PARENTS WITH 
ALZHEIMER'S OR CHILDREN WITH 
CONDITIONS AND YOU COULD EITHER 
MOVE FORWARD OR STAY WHERE YOU ARE 
AND MOST PEOPLE ARE IN FAVOUR OF 
MEDICAL ADVANCES 
BUT IT'S NOT A 
PARTY ISSUE 
NO IT CUTS ACROSS ALL 
THE PARTIES 
WHICH IS WHY IT IS A 
FREE VOTE 
I THINK IT IS AROUND 
CERTAIN PITS OF IT L. THINK THE 
WHIPS WILL COME IN ON CERTAIN PARTS 
OF IT BUT LABOUR M. P.'S ARE ALLOWED 
TO HAVE THEIR CONSCIOUS FOR A DAY 
AND MEANWHILE BY ELECTION IS 
RAPIDLY APPROACHING AND IT DOES NOT 
LOOK GOOD FOR WHAT WAS A LABOUR 
SEAT 
THAT'S RIGHT GWYNETH SEAT GWYNETH DUNWOODY'S DAUGHTER IS CAMPAIGNING 
FOR LABOUR BUT THE POLLS TODAY 
SHOW A TWELVE PER CENT SWING AND THE NEWS OF 
THE WORLD TAKE THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION 
THAT THE PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCED 
TO SORT OUT THE TEN P. TAX ISSUE AND 
THEY CALL IT BROWN THE PUN A A DEFEAT WOULD BE VERY BAD NEWS FOR 
GORDON BROWN WHO HAS THESE 
RUMBLINGS ON HIS BACKBENCHES COULD COULD IT BE ENOUGH BAD NEWS IS ONE THING 
BUT COULD IT BE ENOUGH TO TIP THE 
SCALES IN A WAY THAT HAS NOT YET 
HAPPENED 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE HAPPENED THE TIPPING POINT L. DON'T THINK IT 
WOULD BE THAT CATALYST BASICALLY 
THE OPPOSITION IS DESPERATE AT 
COMING UP AGAINST GORDON BROWN AND 
THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOIV THEY DON'T 
HAVE A CHAMPION TO PARADE AT 
CHAMPION THEY DON'T HAVE A 
CHAMPION TO PARADE AT GORDON BROWN 
BUT IT IS BAD NEWS OVER THE TAX 
CUTS BUT IT TAKES FIVE WHILE TO TURN 
AROUND PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF A 
GOVERNMENT IT VERY RARELY HAPPENS 
WITH ONE ANNOUNCEMENT AN AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY IN THE SUNDAY 
TIMES WHICH LINKS MONEY FAST CARS 
SPIES AND A SEX SCANDAL 
EXTRAORDINARY INDEED THIS IS THE 
LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN THE MAX 
MOSLEY STORY WHEN THE FORMULA ONE 
BOSS WAS CAUGHT IN DUNGEON WITH 
FIVE GIRLS THE SUNDAY TIMES 
REVEALS THAT ONE OF THE PROSTITUTES 
WAS THE WIFE OF AN M. I FIVE OFFICER WHO 
HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN FORCED TO 
LEAVE THE ORGANISATION 
AND THAT 
HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED IT IT IS STATED AS FACT BUT ALSO THE 
WHITEHALL SOURCES ARE SAYING THIS 
WAS NOT A STING AGAINST MAX MOSLEY 
BUT WHAT IS IT COMING TO WHEN M. I FIVE 
THEIR SECURITY IS SO BAD THAT THEY 
DON'T KNOW THAT ONE OF THEIR OWN 
OFFICERS IS MARRIED TO A CALL GIRL 
IF TRUE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE 
AND MOSLEY HAS INSINUATED IF NOT 
SAID DIRECTLY THAT HE THOUGHT HE 
HAD BEEN SET UP AND HE THOUGHT 
THERE WAS AN IMPLISKS OF 
CONSPIRACY AROUND THIS 
IMPLICATION 
AND HE SAID HE FELT HE IMPLICATION WAS SET UP BUT WAS IT BY THE CALL 
GIRLS OR THE SECURITY SERVICES THE 
SECURITY SERVICES SAY IT'S NOTHING 
TO DO WITH THEM ALTHOUGH THERE WAS 
THIS CALL GIRL WHO IS MARRIED TO A 
SECURITY OFFICER 
AND IT'S VERY 
AWKWARD FOR FORMULA ONE HE'S BEEN 
HIDDEN AWAY AND THERE ARE 
DIPLOMATIC PROBLEMS FOR THEM YES YES HE WAS ASKED NOT TO GO TO THE 
BAHRAIN GRAND PRIX AND HE'S BEEN 
TOLD HE WON'T BE WELCOME AT MONACO 
I THINK HE IS STILL IN THE 
FINGERTIP CLUB AND IT SEEMS HE'S A 
DISGRACE TO THAT SPORT 
SHALL WE FINISH WITH PICTURES OF 
THE ROYAL WEDDING WE WONDERED IF 
THERE WOULD BE PICTURES OF THE 
WEDDING TODAY BECAUSE OF THE DEAL 
WITH HELLO MAGAZINE 
YES THE 
QUEEN HAS BEEN SOLD TO HELLO 
MAGAZINE FOR HALF A MILLION THIS 
IS THE WEDDING OF PRINCESS ANN'S 
SON TO AUTUMN KELLY HIS BRIDE 
THERE ARE SO MANY PICTURES IN THE 
PAPERS AND THE MAIL ON SUNDAY HAS 
THIS TWO PAGE SPREAD AND YOU CAN 
SEE THE QUEEN THERE JUST BEHIND 
THEM BUT HELLO MAGAZINE WERE 
GIVEN ACCESS TO OTHER AREAS 
INCLUDING THE RECEPTION SO THEY'LL 
GET THE LEAD ON IT BUT THE EXPRESS 
HIT IT AS THE TACKIEST WEDDING EVER 
BUT THEY ARE OWNED BY O. K. MAGAZINE 
WHICH DIDN'T GET THE PICTURES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORE FROM YOU

TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO 
SAVE AND TRANSFORM MILLIONS OF 
LIVES LET'S TALK TO OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT NORMAN SMITH GOOD 
MORNING TO YOU NORMAN TSM'S A FREE 
VOTE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AN 
ISSUE OF CONSCIENCE THE PRIME 
MINISTER CLEARLY SETTING OUT HIS 
POSITION IN THE OBSERVER TODAY 
STRIKING THE PRIME MINISTER 
OBVIOUSLY FEELS PASSIONATELY THESE 
SORT OF MEDICAL ADVANCES ARE 
NECESSARY NOT JUST BECAUSE OF 
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE BECAUSE HE 
BELIEVES IT COULD CHANGE PEOPLE'S 
LIVES IF YOU HAVE THE STEM CELL 
RESEARCH YOU COULD FIND SOLUTIONS 
TO PARKINSON'S ALZHEIMER'S MAYBE 
EVEN CANCER INTERESTINGLY TOO IN 
TERMS OF SO CALLED SAVIOUR 
SIBLING EMBRYOS A GENETIC MATCH 
TO CHILD WITH GENETIC DISORDER 
THAT MEDICAL WORK COULD SAVE 
CHILDREN'S LIVES TOO HE IS 
PERSONALLY PUTTING HIS WEIGHT 
BEHIND THE CHANGES THE MEDICAL 
SCIENTISTS WANT TO INTRODUCE IT IS 
A FREE VOTE WHATEVER HE HE SAYS IT 
IS HIS PERSONAL OPINION HE CANNOT 
SAY TO LABOUR PARTY M. P.'S YOU MUST 
VOTE THAT WAY IT IS UP TO 
INDIVIDUAL M. P.'S TO DECIDE BASED ON 
THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE HOW THEY WANT 
TO VOTE SO ALTHOUGH HE SPEAKS AS 
THE PRIME MINISTER AS LABOUR LEADER 
ACTUALLY ON THIS ISSUE M. P.'S CAN VOTE 
ANY WAY THEY WANT 
ANOTHER VOTE

STRATEGIST DESPITE A WEEK OF FIGHT 
BACKS WE HAVE HAD FROM GORDON BROWN 
WITH SETTING OUT HIS LEGISLATIVE 
AGENDA THE TEN P. TAX U. TURN THAT

THANK YOU VERY MUCH HE IS NOT LED 
A QUIET LIFE SURVIVING SNAKES AND 
THE NAZIS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AFTER HIS 
LAST ADVENTURE INDIANA JONES IDGE 
IS BACK IT PREMIERS AT THE KHAN 
CANNES CANNES TONIGHT 
PICKING UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF NINETEEN 
YEARS AGO INDIANA JONES IS BACK 
IN THE FILL TESTIMONYSELF THERE IS 
AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HOW MUCH TIME 
HAS PAST 
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE 
EASY 
NOT AS EASY AS IT USED TO BE EASY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT AS GAMBLE 
TO BE FAIR EVERY MOVIE I MADE IS 
GAMBLE THIS WAS SOMETHING THE 
PUBLIC REALLY ASKED ME AND HARRISON 
AND GEORGE AND ALL THE CAST MEMBERS 
WHO WERE IN THE MOVIE WERE ALWAYS 
ASKED NOT OFTEN BUT ALL THE TIME 
WHEN'S INDIANA JONES COMING BACK 
THIS WAS FINALLY WHAT WE NEEDED TO 
DO TO BASICALLY SATISFY I THINK 
NEED TO BRING THE CHARACTER BACK 
IT WAS SOMETHING HARRISON WANTED 
TELL ME ABOUT THE AUDIENCE A LOT 
OF THE PEOPLE WHO THE FILM WILL BE 
AIMED AT THIS TIME WILL NOT WERE 
NOT EVEN BORN WHEN THE HEIGHT OF 
THE FIRST THREE FILMS 
WE DON'T 
FEEL LIKE THERE HAS BEEN ANY KIND 
OF TIME PASSAGE BECAUSE YOU KNOW 
INDIANA JONES HAS BEEN FAR AWAY 
FROM AUDIENCES AS BASICALLY THE 
PUSH OF A BUTTON OR THE SLIPPING OF 
CASSETTE INTO PLAYER IT IS AN 
OLD FASHIONED MOVIE BECAUSE THE 
FIRST THREE MOVIES WERE OLD 
FASHIONED BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY WHEN MADE 
THEM I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING A B. 
MOVIE THAT CHARLTON HESTON USED TO 
BE IN THE SEAHAWK THOSE WERE THE 
ICONIC OLD B. MOVIES THAT I LOVED 
GROWING UP WATCHING THEM ON 
TELEVISION I'M NOT THAT OLD I'M 
OLD BUT NOT THAT OLD L. L. THINK THAT 
I NEEDED TO MOD THEL MOVIE TO 
BECOME A KISSING COUSIN WITH THE 
FIRST THREE L. L. DIDN'T WANT THIS TO 
BE THE BJORN ULTIMATUM OF THE NEW 
GENERATION OF INDIANA JONES THAT 
WASN'T THE POINT HERE 
IT WILL BE A 
COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DOES IT MATTER 
IF IT'S A CRITICAL SUCCESS IT IT MATTERS TO ME THAT PEOPLE GET IT 
AND ENJOY IT AND GIVE IT A BIRTH 
YOU KNOW TOUCHING ANY ONE OF THE 
OTHER THREE MOVIES IN ANY ORDER 
THEY WANT TO PLACE IT FIRST LAST 
MIDDLE IT DOESN'T MATTER 
I REWATCHED THE FIRST ONE THE OTHER 
DAY VERY GOOD 
GREAT STUFF OLD OLD FASHIONED ENTERTAINMENT THE 
HEADLINES GORDON BROWN SAYS 
CONTROVERSIAL NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN 
STEM CELL RESEARCH DEBATED BY M. P.'S 
TOMORROW COULD TRANSFORM MILLIONS 
OF LIVES BRITISH CHARITIES WARNED 
THAT THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN IN BURMA 
WILL DIE FROM HUNGER WITHIN WEEKS 
UNLESS AID REACHES THEM SOON STILL 
TO COME ON BREAKFAST THIS MORNING 
I DON'T MIND AT ALL NO IT'S 
LOVELY TO BE CALLED LOVE MIND 
YOU I HAVEN'T BEEN CALLED IT MANY 
TIMES 
HAVE THINGS TURNED SOUR FROM TIMES BARACK OBAMA WHEN HE CALLED A 
REPORTER SWEETIE 
MATT WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU CALLED 
HIM SWEETY WOULD YOU 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK DARLING 
OH YES NOTHING 
WRONG AT ALL 
WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO WITHOUT 
A BIT OF SWEETY AYE 
GOOD MORNING IF YOU'RE JUST ABOUT 
TO STEP OUTSIDE THE DOOR IT IS A 
BIT FRESH OUT THERE BUT LOTS OF 
SUNSHINE A BIT MORE CLOUD IN 
EASTERN AREAS PARTICULARLY FOR 
ABERDEENSHIRE AND DOWN INTO THE 
BORDERS AND PARTS OF NUMBER 
NUMBERLAND AND THERE COULD BE ONE 
OR TWO SHOWERS WHICH COULD CONTINUE 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT ELSEWHERE A 
LOT OF SUNSHINE THERE IS STILL THE 
REMNANTS OF CLOUD ALONG THE SOUTH 
BUT THAT WILL BREAK AND THE 
SUNSHINE COME OUT AND THE MORNING 
RAIN OVER CARDIGAN BAY WILL PUSH 
OUT INTO THE IRISH CHANNEL AND IT 
WILL BECOME BRIGHTER LATER TODAY 
MOST OF US WILL SEE SUNSHINE DURING 
THE AFTERNOON BUT THE CLOUD WILL 
BUBBLE UP AGAIN AND WE DO IT ALL 
AGAIN TOMORROW 
A CHILLY START AND LOTS OF SEASON 
SHINE SHINE THE REASON WE'RE USING THIS SORT OF 
LANGUAGE SWEETY AND DARLING AND 
THAT SORT OF THING IS BECAUSE 
BARACK OBAMA CALLED REPORTER 
SWEETY WHEN HE WAS ON ONE OF HIS 
CAMPAIGN VISITORS LAST WEEK VISITORS LAST WEEK 
HE DID APOLOGISE TO HER LATER HE HE ACTUALLY RANG HER UP 
THIS ONE SAYS CALLING SOMEBODY 
SWEETY IS NOT BAD THING AND 
THIS ONE SAYS IT ALL DEPENDS ON 
THE SITUATION L. WOULDN'T WANT TO 
BE CALLED IT AT WORK BUT OUTSIDE 
OF WORK IT IS MORE ACCEPTABLE L. 
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT IF 
YOU'RE TRYING TO BE PROFESSIONAL 
AND SOMEBODY CALLS YOU SWEETY OR 
DARLING IT MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL A 
LITTLE OBJECTIVE 
AND THIS ONE SAYS I WAS CALLED 
SWEETY THE OTHER DAY AND IT MADE 
ME FEEL LIKE A FOUR YEAR OLD AM 
BUT NOW CLICK O. K. YOU HAVE A TEAM 
OF ONE HUNDRED PROGRAMMERS WORKING FLAT OUT 
FOR TWO YEARS TO BRING YOU FULLY 
FUNCTIONING PIECE OF SOFTWARE OF 
COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO 
CHARGE YOU MONEY FOR IT AREN'T 
THEY 
WELCOME TO CLICK I'M SPENCER KELLY 
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY YOU'RE SKINT 
NO MORE MONEY FOR THE LATEST 
TECHNOLOGY I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL 
STAYING AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF HIGH 
TECH IS AN EXPENSIVE BUSINESS BUT 
IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO BUY THE LATEST 
P. C. YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO PAY THROUGH THE NOSE 
TO LOAD IT UP WITH USEFUL SOFTWARE 
FOR MANY YEARS BUYING A HOME 
COMPUTER HAS BEEN SYNONYMOUS WITH 
BUYING A COPY OF THE WINDOWS 
OPERATING SYSTEM BUT LED BY DELL 
IT IS NOW GETTING EASIER TO 
PURCHASE P. C. LOADED WITH A CHEAPER 
ALTERNATIVE WINDOWS IS A 
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE COST OF 
NEW SYSTEM SO NOT HAVING TO BUY IT 
WITH YOUR MACHINE CAN SAVE YOU 
PACKET WINDOWS IS THE MARKET 
LEADER AND HAS BEEN INSTALLED ON 
MANY MACHINES BUT IN RECENT YEARS 
LINUX HAS BEEN PLACED ON THEM IT 
IS THE BASIS FOR A VAST ARRAY OF 
OTHER PROGRAMMES LIKE DEBBYIAN 
RED HAT AND UBUNTU UBUNTU HAS 
COLLECTED A LARGE FOLLOWING BECAUSE 
OF ITSIES OF USE 
THE LICENCE UNDER WHICH SOFTWARE IS 
DISTRIBUTED DOES ALLOW COMPANIES TO 
MAKE MONEY OUT OF IT IT IS WORTH 
REMEMBERING THAT THE PROGRAMMERS 
CREATING THESE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES 
IS DIRECTLY COMPETE BEING WINDOWS 
SO IT IS OFTEN BEST TO MAKE THE 
ENVIRONMENT LOOK FAMILIAR 
UBUNTU SEEMS TO EMULATE THE WINDOWS 
EXPERIENCE AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE 
SO IF YOU ARE BUYING A NEW MACHINE 
OR UPGRADING AN OLD ONE A LINUX 
BASED OPERATING SYSTEM IS WELL 
WORTH CONSIDERING ESPECIALLY IF 
YOU ARE ON A TIGHT BUDGET BUT IT 
IS A COMPLEX WAY TO SAVE MONEY 
THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF FREE 
SOFTWARE TO PICK FROM RIGHT 
YOU'VE JUST BOUGHT A BRAND NEW 
COMPUTER AND ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE JUST 
SHELLED OUT SEVERAL WEEKS' WORTH OF 
HARD EARNED CASH IT IS STILL NOT 
LOADED WITH ALL THE SOFTWARE YOU 
NEED SO HOW DO YOU GET THE BASICS 
ON THE CHEAP TO BROWSE THE WEB YOU 
HAVE LOTS OF OPTIONS ALTHOUGH 
MICROSOFT'S INTERNET EXPLORER IS 
FREE TO DOWNLOAD IT IS LIMITED TO 
WINDOWS USERS THERE ARE COUNTLESS 
OTHER BROWSERS AROUND THE MOST 
POPULAR IS FIFE FOX HOTLY FOLLOWED 
BY SAFARI AND OPERA AND WITH 
HUNDREDS OF PROGRAMMERS WORKING ON 
EACH THEY ARE IN A CONSTANT BATTLE 
TO BE THE MOST FEATURE RICH BROWSER 
AROUND FIREFOX 
WEB BROWSERS HAVE 
BEEN ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING 
AREAS WHERE FREE SOFTWARE HAS BEEN 
ABLE TO INNOVATE MICROSOFT HAVE 
BEEN SO DOMINANT OF THE MARKET 
THERE HAS NOT BEEN ROOM FOR 
COMMERCIAL ALTERNATIVES SO IT HAS 
BEEN LEFT TO ENTHUSIASTS AND THE 
OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY TO TAKE AREAS 
WHERE THEY THINK BROWSERS COULD BE 
IMPROVED AND TO PUT THAT INTO THEIR 
OWN PRODUCTS IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
THINGS LIKE TABBED BROWSING AND 
POP UP BLOCKING AND AUTOCOMPLETING 
OF FORMS THESE ARE INNOVATIONS WE 
SAW FIRST OF ALL IN FREE SOFTWARE 
BUT THEN PICKED UP SPECIFICALLY BY 
MICROSOFT AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY 
SO REGARDLESS OF WHICH OPERATING 
SYSTEM YOU'VE PICKED THERE IS AN 
ARRAY OF BROWSERS TO CHOOSE FROM 
EACH ONE PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF 
BROWSING TECHNOLOGY BUT LET'S NOT 
GET CARRIED AWAY USING A MACHINE 
CONNECTED TO THE NET MAKES YOU 
VULNERABLE TO ATTACK SO PROTECTING 
YOURSELF WITH ANTI VIRAL SYSTEMS IS 
A MUST A. V. G. IS POPULAR AND FREE FOR 
HOME USERS THE COMPANY MAKES ITS 
MONEY BY SELLING SERVICES TO SMALL 
BUSINESSES SO EVEN AS NON PAYING 
USERS YOU'LL GET REGULAR SECURITY 
UPDATES 
A. V. G. IS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE UPDATES BUT HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY MANY 
MORE PRODUCTS THAT PRETEND TO BE 
FREE ANTI VIRUS PRODUCTS OR SPYWARE 
DETECTORS AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING 
IS THEY'RE EITHER INSTALLING 
SPYWARE THEMSELVES OR JUST 
DETECTING IT AND THEN ASKING YOU TO 
PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL REMOVE 
IT THAT'S SEVENTYCAL AND NOT VERY 
HELPFUL IF YOU'RE TRYING TO RUN 
YOUR MACHINE FOR FREE 
NOW THAT YOU 
ARE PROTECTED TIME TO DO SOME WORK 
AND TO THE BEST VALUE FREE WARE WE 
CAN FIND ON OFFICE IS AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO MICROSOFT'S OFFICE 
IT IS A HEFTY DOWNLOAD AT ONE HUNDRED MEGS 
BUT IT GIVES YOU SPREAD SHEETS AND 
DATA PROCESSING AND ALL CAN READ 
AND SAVE IN FORM YACHTS COMPATIBLE 
WITH MICROSOFT'S OFFICE SUITE 
PAUL IS A SEASONED USER OF FREE 
SOFTWARE SOFTWARE WHY DO PEOPLE WRITE FREE SOFTWARE 
WHY DO THEY DEDICATE THEIR TIME TO 
IT AND GIVE IT AWAY THINK IT'S 
PARTLY BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE KUDOS 
AND OUTCLASSING SOFTWARE THAT HAS 
BEEN PRODUCED BY MASSIVE COMPANIES 
LIKE MICROSOFT AND THEY LIKE THE 
COMMENTS AS WELL 
BUT WE SEE A LOT 
OF SOFTWARE THAT IS FULLY FEATURED 
WHAT IS THE COMPANY GETTING IN 
RETURN SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT 
GETTING ADVERTS OR THEM SELLING MY 
DETAILS 
THERE IS A DISTINCTION TO DETAILS BE MADE BETWEEN LEGITIMATE 
COMPANIES WHO WILL TRY TO GAIN 
DETAILS AND TRY TO UPSELL YOU AND 
COMPANIES THAT PUT IN SPYWARE IN 
THE DOWNLOAD AND THE BEST ADVICE 
IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO CHOOSE TO 
DOWNLOAD FREE SOFTWARE GO TO A 
REPUTABLE SOURCE GO TO ONE OF THE 
MAJOR MAGAZINES OR TAKE A 
RECOMMENDATION FROM A FRIEND AND 
WHEN YOU GET THERE IF THERE IS A 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS SECTION HAVE 
A QUICK READ THROUGH IT AND MAKE 
SURE YOU ARE NOT TICKING BOXES THAT 
SAY THE COMPANIES CAN SELL ON YOUR 
DETAILS AFTERWARDS 
O. K. THOSE ARE 
THE BASICS AND PAUL ALLAN MENTIONED 
A COUPLE OF TIPS TO HELP AVOID THE 
PIT FALLS BUT THERE ARE STILL 
PLENTY OF APPLICATIONS AROUND JOAN 
LINE WHICH SAY THEY'LL DO A GREAT 
JOB FOR NOTHING SO WHICH TO 
CHOOSE CHOOSE HERE'S MARK WITH CLICKS PICK WE'VE 
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT FREE SECURITY 
PRODUCTS IN THE FORM OF ANTI VIRUS 
EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME NOW HERE 
IS A FIREWALL ZONEALARM WHICH 
SHOULD HELP PREVENT INTRUSIONS INTO 
YOUR MACHINE IT ACTS LIKE AN F. B. I. 
PROFILER IT LEARNS THE BEHAVIOUR 
OF ALL THE OTHER SOFTWARE ON YOUR 
MACHINE AND IF THAT STARTS TO ACT 
UNUSUALLY SENDING OR RECEIVING 
DATA WHEN IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT IS 
WHEN THE FIREWALL KICKS IN 
CONFIGURATION OF THE FIREWALL IS 
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE 
GETTING THE BEST OUT OF IT THE 
INSTRUCTIONS ARE FAIRLY EASY TO 
FOLLOW SLIDE RULES TO SET THE 
LEVEL OF SECURITY BEWARE OF 
SETTING THE SECURITY TOO HIGH 
WHICH LEADS TO LOTS OF POP UP 
WINDOWS ASKING FOR THE SIMPLEST OF 
INFRUCTIONS INFRUCTIONS INSTRUCTIONS ORGANISING YOUR 
DIGITAL MUSIC CAN BE A PAIN IF YOU 
DON'T BOTHER TO USE SOME SORT OF 
MEDIA MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE SO THE 
NEXT PICK IS A HELPFUL SIMION WITH 
A FONDNESS FOR MUSIC BUT WINDOWS 
ONLY MEDIA MONKEY SEARCHES FOR 
AUTOFILES TAKE YOUR PICK FROM FORM 
YACHTS FORMATS LIKE M. P. THREE IPODS 
AND IT WILL ORGANISE IT FOR YOU

MOVING AROUND FILES AND FOLDERS ON 
THE DESK TOP IN A GHOSTLY FASHION

SOLUTIONS OUT THERE MICROSOFT 
ALLOWS USERS TO STORE UP TO FORTY FIVE GIG

ENOUGH GO TO A DRIVEN HERE YOU 
CAN FOR A WHOPPING FIFTY GIGS OF DATA

GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO BREAKFAST 
GORDON BROWN COMESOUS FIGHTING ON 
HYBRID EMBRYO RESEARCH A DAY AHEAD 
OF CRUCIAL VOTES IT HE SAYS IT HAS 
THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM MILLIONS 
OF LYES 
LIVES 
GOOD MORNING IT IS SUNDAY EIGHTEENTH MAY 
ALSO ON THE PROGRAMME AID AGENCIES 
WARN THAT THOUSANDS OF YOUNG 
CHILDREN IN BURMA COULD DIE OF 
STARVATION UNLESS FOOD REACHES 
THEM URGENTLY DESPITE THE THREAT 
OF AFTERSHOCKS RESCUERS IN CHINA 
REFUSE TO GIVE UP THEIR SEARCH BUT 
HOPE OF FINDING MORE SURVIVES IS 
FADING SURVIVORS IT IS THE 
MORNING AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE HERE 
IT WAS INCREDIBLE PARTY YESTERDAY 
TO CELEBRATE POMPEY WINNING THE F. A. 
CUP AFTER SIXTY NINE YEARS ONCE THE CLEAR 
UP IS OVER HARRY REDKNAPP AND HIS 
TEAM WILL BE SHOWING OFF THE TROPHY 
TO THOUSANDS OF P. FANS 
WE ARE 
ALWAYS ASKED WHEN IS INDIAN THAT 
JONES COMING BACK 
STEVEN SPIELBERG 
TELLS BREAKFAST WHILE YOU ARE NEVER 
TOO OLD TO PLAY AN ALL ACTION HERO 
AND WHEN IT IS O. K. TO CALL SOMEONE 
SWEETIE WE WILL DISCUSS THE WARM 
WORDS THAT LANDED OBAMA IN HOT 
WATER FIRST THE PRIME MINISTER 
HAS SAID HE WILL VOTE IN FAVOUR OF 
RESEARCH USING HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRID 
EMBRYOS IN A CRUCIAL VOTE TOMORROW 
WRITING IN THE OBSERVER HE CHARGES 
CRITICS WHO HAVE LABELLED THE 
RESEARCH AS FRANKENSTEIN SERVICE 
SCIENCE AND SAYS IT HAS THE 
POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM MILLIONS OF 
LIVES SCIENTISTS IN NEWCASTLE HAVE 
ALREADY CREATED HYBRID EMBRYOS BY 
INSERTING HUMAN D. N. A. INTO COWS EGGS 
WHICH HAD MOST OF THEIR GENETIC 
MATERIAL REMOVED THE AIM IS TO 
EXTRACT STEM CELLS FROM THE EMBRYOS 
WHEN THEY ARE STILL SMALLER THAN A 
PIN HEAD TO STUDY A RANGE OF 
DISEASES DISEASES IN HIS OBSERVER ARTICLE MR. BROWN 
MAKES CLEAR HIS STRONG SUPPORT FOR 
THE METHODS AND DIRECTION OF THIS 
CONTROVERSIAL AREA OF SCIENCE MR. 
BROWN SAYS STEM CELL RESEARCH MAKES 
IT POSSIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE NEW AND 
EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AND CURES FOR 
DISEASES THAT HAVE AFFLICTED 
MANKIND OVER CENTURIES 
HE SAYS HE HAS DEEP RESPECT FOR 
THOSE OPPOSED TO HYBRID EMBRYOS 
BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS CONVICTION BUT 
ARGUES THIS IS A PROFOUND 
OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE AND TRANSFORM 
MILLIONS OF LIFES MR. BROWN SAY HE 
IS WILL BE VOTING IN FAVOUR OF 
SAVIOUR SIBLING TECHNOLOGY THIS 
HAS BEEN USED TO SUCCESSFULLY TREAT 
SICK CHILDREN LIKE CHARLIE WHITAKER 
GIVEN A TRANSPLANT USING UMBILICAL 
CORD BLOOD FROM HIS BABY BROTHER 
IN ANOTHER FREE VOTE THIS WEEK THE 
PRIME MINISTER SAYS HE WILL SUPPORT 
MEASURES AIMED AT MAKING IT EASIER 
FOR LESBIAN AND SINGLE WOMEN TO 
SEEK FERTILITY TREATMENT AND 
FINALLY ON ABORTION MR. BROWN HAS 
MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE WILL VOTE 
AGAINST ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE THE 
CURRENT TWENTY FOUR WEEK TIME LIMIT THE 
PRIME MINISTER MAY SWAY MANY M. P.'S 
BUT THESE ARE NOT PARTY POLITICAL 
ISSUE BUT MATTERS OF CONSCIENCE 
TO BE DECIDED ON A FREE VOTE 
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN IN BURMA 
COULD DIE OF STARVATION UNLESS FOOD 
REACHES THEM URGENTLY SAVE THE 
CHILDREN SAYS AS MANY AS THIRTY THOUSAND 
YOUNGSTERS ARE ALREADY MALNOURISHED 
OR WERE ALREADY MALNOURISHED BEFORE 
LAST WEEK SIGH CONE HIT AID 
AGENCIES ARE STILL TRYING TO GET 
ACCESS TO THE RENAL AND IN A FEW 
MINUTES TIME WE WILL SEE SOME 
EXCLUSIVE FOOT TADGE OF HOW 
SURVIVORS ARE COPING THE SEARCH 
CONTINUES FOR SURVIVORS OF MONDAY'S 
EARTHQUAKE IN CHINA BUT THE RESCUE 
WORK HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY A SERIES 
OF LARGE AFTERSHOCK ONE MEASURES 
SIX POINT ONE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS 
PLACED THE SUPPORT IT HAS BEEN 
GIVEN FROM ROUND THE WORLD WE CAN 
SPEAK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT IN THE 
CHENGDU PROVINCE IN SOUTH WEST 
CHINA DAN WE ARE BECOMING 
FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THESE VERY 
HARROWING IMAGES STILL EMERGING 
AND I KNOW SOME MORE PICTURES 
COMING OUT TODAY 
THAT IS RIGHT 
FRESH PICTURES OF THIS EARTHQUAKE 
AND ITS EFFECTS STILL EMERGING AND 
THIS IS THE VILLAGE OF OR WHAT 
REMAINS OF IT IT IS A SEA OF MUD 
AND THE MUD CAME DOWN IN A 
LANDSLIDE COVERED M. U. P. OF THE 
VILLAGE AND THE REALLY WORRYING 
THING FOR RESCUE WORKERS MUCH 
NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE 
BURIED BENEATH THE MUD BUT OF 
COURSE WHEN THEY DO FINALLY GET TO 
THE BOTTOM AND REMOVE THOSE BODY 
IT WILL BE YET ANOTHER 
HARROWING SCENE IN THE AFTERMATH OF 
THE EARTHQUAKE AND I THINK WE ARE 
LIKELY TO SEE MORE SIMILAR PICTURES 
LIKE THESE EMERGE MANAGER THE DAYS 
AHEAD AS THE FULL DEVASTATION OF 
THIS EARTHQUAKE NOW BECOMES CLEAR 
YES EMERGING WE LOOK AT THE 
PICTURES NOW IT IS WORTH 
EMPHASISING ALL YOU CAN SEE IS 
EARTH AND I AM ASSUMING THAT THE 
VILLAGE IS LITERALLY COVERED UP AND 
T. N. REASON WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE 
IMAGES IS BECAUSE IT IS VERY HARD 
TO GET THERE 
ABSOLUTELY THAT IS 
RIGHT THAT IS WHY WE WILL SEE MORE 
PICTURES EMERGE IN THE DAYS AHEAD 
JUST BECAUSE OF THAT REASON WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT SOME VERY REMOTE 
AREAS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS 
AREAS THAT SO FAR HAVE BEEN 
DIFFICULT TO GET TO AND AREAS IF 
THEY WERE O. OBLITERATED THERE WOULD 
BE NO ONE THERE TO SEND OUT SIGNALS 
OR MESSAGES TO SAY THIS IS WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED SO THAT IS WHY I THINK IN 
COMING DAYS WE WILL SEE MORE OF 
THESE SIMILAR IMAGES AS RESCUE 
WORKERS AND AID WORKERS GET THROUGH 
TO SOME OF THESE PLACES AND SEND 
BACK THESE EXTREMELY HARROWING 
DISTURBING PICTURES OF THE DAMAGE 
AND DEVASTATION CAUSED BY THIS 
EARTHQUAKE 
THANK YOU FOR THAT IT EARTHQUAKE SHOULD BE SIMPLER TO BUY A TRAIN 
TICKET IN ADVANCE FROM TODAY RAIL

THEIR INDIVIDUAL DEALS IN FAVOUR OF 
ONE PREBOOKED TICKET CALLED SIMPLY 
ADVANCE IT WILL BE AVAILABLE

STANDARD TEN REFUND CHARGE IF YOU

CELEBRATIONS ARE CONTINUING THERE 
WILL BE A BIG PARADE DOWN HERE ON 
THE COMMON YOU CAN SEE THE BIG 
SCREEN IS UP THE STAGE IS SET 
READY FOR HARRY REDKNAPP AND HIS 
TEAM TO BRING THE F. A. CUP HERE THE 
PARADE WILL START AT ROUND THREE HUNDRED AT 
FRATTON PARK BUT THE TEAM WILL GET 
ON TO OPEN TOP BUS COME THROUGH 
PORTSMOUTH CITY THEY WILL TAKE 
ABOUT AND HOUR ARRIVING HERE ON 
SOUTH SEA COMMON AT FOUR HUNDRED SO YOU 
CAN SEE THE CLEAR UP OPERATION 
BEHIND ME THIS NEEDS TO BE CLEARED 
UP BY FOUR HUNDRED BECAUSE WE EXPECT ROUND 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FANS TO LINE THE ROUTES OF 
PORTSMOUTH CITY TO CELEBRATE 
POMPEY WINNING THE F. A. CUP AT LONG 
LAST 
SHOULD BE QUITE A DAY DOWN LAST THERE NOW FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN 
HAVE SPENT THE NIGHT WALKING 
THROUGH LONDON IN THEIR UNDERWEAR 
THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING PART IN A 
CHARITY MARATHON CALLED MOONWALK TO 
RAISE FUNDS FOR BREAST CANCER 
CHARITIES THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MILE ROUTE SAW 
BRA CLAD ENTRANTS DO A CIRCUIT 
STARTING FROM HYDE PARK THAT IS A 
LONG WAY TO WALK AND GOOD FOR THEM 
THOSE ARE THE MAIN STORIES IT IS 
THOR THAN TWO WEEKS SINCE CYCLONE 
NARGIS HIT BURMA WITH ONLY A 
TRICKLE OF AID THE SUFFERING OF 
SURVIVES GETS WORSE THE PLIGHT OF 
THOSE IN LAPUTTA IS DESPERATE WE 
WILL BE TALKING TO AN AID WORKER 
WHO HAS JUST RETURNED FROM THERE 
PEOPLE NEED FOOD AND OF COURSE 
MEDICINE NOW THOUGH HEAVY MONSOON 
RAIN POSES NEW THREATS SUCH AS 
PNEUMONIA THOSE PICTURES WERE 
TAKEN JONATHAN AND HE IS HERE NOW 
THE MONSOON JONATHAN COMPOUNDS THE 
PROBLEM DOESN'T IT 
THAT IS RIGHT 
THE SITUATION IS REALLY DESPERATE 
FOR SURVIVES OF THIS DISASTER IN 
THE IRRAWADDY RIGHT NOW A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE ON THE MOVE PEOPLE ARE 
LOOKING FOR SHELTER PEOPLE ARE 
LOOKING FOR FOOD WE ARE SEEING 
PEOPLE WHO WERE INJURED BODY 
INJURIES WHEN THE STORM HIT THESE 
INJURIES HAVE BEEN BECOME INFECTED 
AND THOSE PEOPLE NEED URGENT 
TREATMENT 
YES NOW WHAT PEOPLE TREATMENT PERHAPS ARE NOT AWARE OF YET IT IS 
VERY CLEARLY ILLUSTRATED THERE IS 
THE RAIN THAT IS JUST ONGOING 
KEEPS RAINING AND IS MAKING THE 
PROBLEM SO MUCH WORSE YES YES CERTAINLY WHILE I WAS THERE IT 
RAINED FOR FORTY EIGHT HOUR CONTINUOUSLY 
IT HAS RELIEVED THE NEED FOR FRESH 
DRINKING WATER TO SOME EXTENT BUT 
THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE 
LIVING THEY ARE SATURATE RATED 
THE GROUND IS WATERLOGGED THIS 
MEANS THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS ARE 
INSANITARY AND WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
OUTBREAKS OF ACUTE DIARRHOEA 
BECAUSE OF THE EXPOSURE AND COLD WE 
COULD SEE PNEUMONIA GETTING A MAJOR 
CONCERN IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS AS WELL AS BEING INVOLVED 
WE HAVE A 
BIG TEAM WORKING OUT THERE WE HAD A 
PROGRAMME IN THIS REGION BEFORE 
THE STORM HIT 
SORRY TALK US 
THROUGH THE IMAGES WE CAN SEE HERE 
THIS IS TYPICAL OF A WOMAN SHE HAD 
A VERY BAD HEAD INJURY DURING THE 
STORM SHE EXPLAINED SHE WAS IN THE 
DARK THE WIND WAS FEROCIOUS THE 
AIR WAS LITERALLY FULL OF FLYING 
OBJECTS AND SHE WAS HIT AS MANY 
PEOPLE WERE THE WIND WAS THE 
WOUND WAS PATCHED UP BY SOMEONE 
AFTER THE STORM IT HAS BEEN 
INFECTED SO WE ARE TRAINING LOCAL 
DOCTORS AND BRINGING MORE DOCTORS 
IN FROM THE CAPITAL INTO THIS 
REGION AND THEY ARE HELPING PEOPLE 
LIKE THIS WE HAVE FOUR CLINICS 
RUNNING IN THIS TOWN LAPUTTA AND WE 
ARE GETTING OUT INTO THE SMALLER 
SETTLEMENTS 
IT IS INTERESTING WHAT SETTLEMENTS WE SAW THERE BECAUSE WE SAW ONE OF 
YOUR WORKER THERE SPEAKING TO A 
LOCAL DOCTOR ALMOST TAKING THEM 
THROUGH WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE IS 
THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT SO 
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN RESTRICTIONS 
ON AID WORKERS GETTING IN LOTS OF 
TRAINING HAS TO BE DONE OF THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLOWED TO WORK 
THERE WHICH ARE LARGELY BURMESE 
PEOPLE 
NOT QUITE THAT IS TYPICAL PEOPLE OF THE WAY AID EFFORTS OPERATE IN 
THESE SIC SITUATIONS BY FAR OF THE 
BULL OF COURSE THE AID EVEN THAT 
DELIVERED BY INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANISATIONS IS DELIVERED IN A 
HANDS ON WAY BUT NATIONALS OF THE 
COUNTRY AND WHAT ORGANISATIONS 
LIKE MERLIN AND OTHER MEMBERS OF 
THE DISASTER EMERGENCY COMMITTEE DO 
IS SEND THE EXPERTS THAT ARE USED 
TO WORKING IN THESE SITUATION AND 
THEY HELP TO IDENTIFY THE LOCAL 
STAFF AND TO TRAIN THEM TO MAKE 
THE BEST USE OF RESOURCES MERLIN'S MERLIN'S EXPERIENCE BY COMPARISON WITH MOST 
PLACES IS VERY GOOD BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE THERE 
YOU HAD A FOOT HOLD ALREADY THERE 
ARE WARNINGS OF ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF 
LIVES THAT COULD BE LOST THERE IS 
AN ALARMING PICTURE 
IT IS L. MEAN 
YOU SAID IN THE START YOU DESCRIBE 
THE AID COMING IN AS A TRICKLE L. 
WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT AS THAT THERE 
IS AID GETTING THROUGH BOTH 
PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND 
INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES CERTAINLY 
WE WANT TO SEE IT INCREASE AND WE 
WANT TO SEE IT COME THROUGH FASTER 
BUT MERLIN IS REACHING ROUND 
SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE AREA WE ARE 
OPERATING OTHER BRITISH AGENCIES 
ARE GETTING SUPPORT THROUGH TO OVER 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO AID IS GETTING THROUGH 
WE WANT TO SEE IT GET THROUGH 
QUICKER BUT WE ARE SAVING LIVES 
EVERY DAY THERE NOW 
I NOU KNOW YOU 
ARE LOOKING AT THE IMAGES FROM 
CHINA A WHILE AGO THIS IS A TOWN 
THAT HAS DISAPPEARED YOU ARE 
SAYING THAT CORRESPONDS WITH SOME 
OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE SEEN THIS 
CYCLONE IS A DISASTER OF THE 
HIGHEST MAGNITUDE AND THERE ARE 
VILLAGES THAT THIS DELTA IS A 
SERIES OF LOW LYING ISLANDS THAT 
STRETCH FOR FIFTY MILES ALONG THE 
COAST AND THE WAVE WENT COMPLETELY 
OVER THE TOP OF THEM SO YOU ARE 
SEEING SETTLEMENTS WHICH WERE VERY 
POOR 
THEY WERE BUILT 
OF HOUSES MADE POOR OF BAMBOO AND STRAW MATTING AND 
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT OF THEM SO 
YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THE DEBRIS OR

TOUCHING ANY ONE OF THE OTHER THREE 
MOVIES MOVIES BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND STEVEN 
SPIELBERG TALKS TO US ABOUT THE 
RETURN OF THE ARCHAEOLOGIST INDIANA 
JONES JONES LET'S GET THE WEATHER FROM MATT 
HELLO THERE AFTER THAT WET BLIP 
YESTERDAY WE ARE BACK INTO A SPELL 
OF DRY AND REASONABLY BRIGHT 
WEATHER WEATHER COMPARED TO LAST WEEK IT WILL BE 
THAT GOOD DEAL COOLER CERTAINLY A 
FRESH START THIS MORNING QUITE 
CHILLY IN ONE OR TWO SPOTS WITH A 
FROST ACROSS RURAL SCOTLAND BUT 
LOTS OF SUNSHINE THOSE CLEAR SKIES 
HAVE BEEN PUSHING DOWN OVERNIGHT 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE COUNTRY A 
LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD CLINGING ON TO 
THE SOUTH COAST IT'S DRY AND SUNNY 
THE OVERNIGHT RAIN WILL STILL BE 
AROUND ACROSS THE CHANNEL ISLANDS 
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING 
THE SHOWERS ARE CLEARING AWAY FROM 
THE SOUTH WEST AND TURNING MUCH 
DRIER AND BRIGHTER ACROSS WALES 
WITH LONG SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
DEVELOPING DEVELOPING IT'S ELEVEN DEGREES CELSIUS IN 
BELFAST WITH A FRESH EASTERLY WIND 
IT WILL BE DRY AND SUNNY HERE 
IN SCOTLAND WE HAVE CLOUD BUILDING 
UP ACROSS EASTERN AREAS A FEW 
SHOWERS DOWN EASTERN PARTS FROM 
ABERDEENSHIRE THROUGH TO THE 
BORDERS OF NORTHUMBERLAND HIT AND 
MISS BUT MOST PLACES WILL BE DRY 
IT'S LOOKING FINE ACROSS THE NORTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND AND THE MIDLANDS 
THROUGH DATE WE WILL SEE MORE 
CLOUD BUBBLE UP WE CAN SEE THE 
SHADOWS EXPANDING HERE ON THE MAP 
THAT COULD BLOT OUT OF THE SUNSHINE 
AT TIMES THIS AFTERNOON IF YOU ARE 
SPENDING ANY LENGTH OF TIME IN THE 
SUNSHINE BE WARNED THE SUN IS AS 
STRONG AS LAST WEEKEND EVEN THOUGH 
TEMPERATURES ARE LOWER AT AROUND 
ELEVEN TO SIXTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS 
THIS EVENING SKIES WILL CLEAR 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE COUNTRY ONCE 
AGAIN ANYWHERE THROUGH NORTHERN 
ENGLAND AND PARTS OF NORTHERN 
IRELAND TEMPERATURES LOW ENOUGH 
FOR AN AIR FROST AND GRASS FROST IN 
ONE OR TWO SPOTS 
A COLDER NIGHT ACROSS SOUTHERN 
PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
WE BEGIN A RATHER CHILLY NIGHT ON 
MONDAY CLEAR BLUE SKIES FOR THE 
MOST PART LIKE TODAY WE WILL SEE 
THE CLOUD JUST START TO MUSHROOM UM 
A LITTLE BIT AND SPREAD OUT AND 
TAKE OUT SOME OF THAT SUNSHINE 
DURING THE AFTERNOON 
THE REASON FOR THE DRY SPELL HIGH 
PRESSURE IS BUILDING IN FROM THE 
NORTH BECAUSE IT'S BUILDING IN 
FROM THE NORTH IT'S A COLDER HIGH 
THAN LAST WEEK AND IT WILL KEEP THE 
RAIN BEARING CLOUDS OUT TOWARDS THE 
WEST ON MOONED TUESDAY 
BY WEDNESDAY TEMPERATURES LIFTING 
A TOUCH SUNNY DAYS TO COME 
AS THE CREDIT CRUNCH BITES DEBT 
ADVICE AGENCIES SAY THEY ARE BEING 
SWAMPED BY DEMAND FROM MIDDLE 
INCOME FAMILIES 
MORE PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS ARE 
SEEKING HELP AS WELL AS THOSE 
WORKING IN FINANCE DEBT ADVISORS 
SAY CHEAP LENDING HAS CONTRIBUTED 
TO THE PROBLEM WITH MANY SPENDING 
ON LUXURY ITEMS BECAUSE THEY COULD 
JAMIE ELLIOT IS FROM TRANCACT AN 
ORGANISATION WHICH PROVIDES 
TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO DEBT 
ADVISORS SUCH AS THE CITIZENS 
ADVICE BUREAU MORE MIDDLE CLASS 
FAMILIES GETTING INTO TROUBLE YES YES WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED MEMBERS TRANCACT 
MEMBERS ARE TELLING US THAT THEY 
ARE OVERWHEMED WITH AN INCREASE IN 
DEMAND MUCH OF IT FROM HOMEOWNERS 
AND PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE BEFORE 
THEY SAW MANY BENEFIT CLAIMANTS AND 
SOCIAL HOUSING TENANTS 
THE REASON 
FOR THIS IS BECAUSE PEOPLE'S BILLS 
ARE GOING UP AND THEY'RE NOT 
BUDGETING TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT 
OR ARE THEY BORROWING TOO MUCH 
MONEY WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THERE IS 
NOT ONE MAIN REASON IT'S A NASTY 
COMBINATION OF FACTORS ONE IS 
CERTAINLY THAT ENERGY COSTS ARE 
GOING UP FOOD BILLS ARE GOING UP 
BUT THE COST OF CREDIT ITSELF HAS 
GONE UP AS PEOPLE HAVE COME OFF 
FIXED RATE MORTGAGES SUDDENLY 
THEIR MORTGAGES HAVE SHOT UP ONE 
NURSE HER MORTGAGE WAS FIVE HUNDRED A 
MONTH SHE WAS QUITE STRETCHED BUT 
HER FIXED RATE ENDED HER MONTHLY 
PAYMENTS ROSE FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY A 
MONTH THAT HAS PUSHED HER INTO 
DEBT NOW SHE CAN'T MEET HER 
MORTGAGE REPAYMENTS AND HER FLAT IS 
AT RISK IF SHE IS REPOSSESSED WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THAT 
SOME OF THESE THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE 
IF THE MORTGAGE GOES UP IT HAS TO 
BE PAID DOES IT ARE THERE WAYS 
PEOPLE CAN GET AROUND THESE 
PROBLEMS CAN YOU DO A DEAL WITH 
YOUR LENDER 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT 
ADVISORS USED TO SAY THEY USED TO 
SAY TO THE LENDER OUR CLIENT CAN 
AFFORD TO PAY THIRTY A MONTH FOR 
EXAMPLE THE ADVISER WILL SAY GIVE 
US FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THAT IS NOT HAPPENING 
BECAUSE THE CREDIT CRUNCH MEANS 
THEY ARE DESPERATE TO GET MONEY IN 
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SHORT OF 
LIQUIDITY THEY'RE SAYING NO AND 
THEY'RE NOT NEGOTIATING OUR DEBT 
ADVISORS AT THE TRANCACT MEMBER 
CAPITALISE AT TO INBEE HALL IN EAST 
LONDON SAYING WE ARE GETTING A 
BRICK WALL AND MEMBERS ARE NOT 
PREPARE TO NEGOTIATE PRESUMABLY PRESUMABLY THERE ARE STILL SOME THINGS PEOPLE 
CAN DO IF THEY FACE THESE PROBLEMS 
YES 
WHAT ARE YOUR TOP THREE TIPS YES THE TOP THREE TIPS IS NOT PUT YOUR 
HEAD IN THE SAND AS SOON AS YOU 
GET A PROBLEM SEEK DEBT ADVICE 
FROM CITIZENS ADVICE CAPITALISE IN 
LONDON OR WHEREVER YOU CAN GO WE 
HAVE TO STOP THINKING ABOUT BORROW 
WORRY TOMORROW IN TERMS OF 
GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT CULTURE OF 
BORROWING WHERE WE BORROW AGAINST 
OUR PROPERTY ONE CLIENT HAS 
BORROWED THIRTY THOUSAND CREDIT CARD DEBT 
AGAINST THEIR HOME WE NEED TO SAVE 
OUR MONEY THERE NEEDS TO BE 
INVESTMENT IN HELPING PEOPLE MANAGE 
MONEY BETTER OUR PROJECT SAFE AT 
TO INBEE HALL GETS STUDENTS TO SAVE 
STUDENTS SPEND AN AVERAGE OF FIFTEEN A 
DAY ON SNACKS AND LUNCH AND THEY 
WONDER WHERE THEIR MONEY IS GO IF 
YOU EDUCATE PEOPLE IN MONEY 
MANAGEMENT IT WILL MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE 
SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT DIFFERENCE THE GOVERNMENT HAS ENCOURAGED 
STUDENTS TO GET INTO DEBT IN THE 
FIRST PLACE 
THAT IS ANOTHER STORY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH JAMIE 
IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT THE SUNDAY 
PAPERS WITH KEVIN YOU ARE BACK I I AM 
LET'S LOOK AT THE HEADLINES AM THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SUNDAY TIMES 
THE BIG PICTURE STORY OF THE 
ROYAL WEDDING YESTERDAY IT'S MR. 
AND MRS. PHILLIPS THIS IS THE 
QUEEN'S GRANDSON PETER HE GOT 
MARRIED YESTERDAY THEY ALSO HAVE 
THE STORY OF THE M. I FIVE LINK TO THE 
MAX MOSLEY SEX SCANDAL SUGGESTING 
THAT THE WIFE OF AN M. I FIVE OFFICER WAS 
ONE OF THE PROSTITUTES WHO WAS 
INVOLVED INVOLVED YOU COULDN'T MAKE THAT ONE UP 
ALSO ON THE FRONT OF THE SUNDAY 
TELEGRAPH WHO ARE CLAIMING IT AS 
AN EXCLUSIVE THEY HAVE A PICTURE 
OF THE ROYAL WEDDING TOO THEY SAY 
THOUSANDS OF BRITISH WOMEN HAVE HAD 
FOUR OR MORE ABORTIONS 
I SEEM TO HAVE OPENED UP THE SPORTS 
PAGES PAGES IT'S THE BIG STORY FOR SOME PEOPLE 
THAT WAS THE F. A. CUP FINAL YESTERDAY 
PORTSMOUTH WERE THE WINNERS 
THE SUNDAY EXPRESS THIS MORNING 
LOOKING AT THE UPSIDE OF THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH BRITAIN'S SHOPPERS WILL 
ENJOY THE BEST SALES FOR DECADE 
THIS SUMMER 
THE INDEPENDENT HAVE A STORY OF 
POMPEY SUPPORTER THEY HAVE A STORY 
ABOUT MRSA THEY SAY SCIENTISTS IN 
THE U. K. ARE ABOUT TO MAKE A 
BREAKTHROUGH ON THE MRSA BUG 
THEY'RE SAYING THAT SOME ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED 
LIVES A YEAR COULD BE SAVED IF IT'S 
SUCCESSFUL 
KEVIN THE INDEPENDENT SUCCESSFUL ON SUNDAY INSIDE PAGES IS LOOKING 
AT THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE 
RELIEF AND RESCUE EFFORT IN CHINA 
THAT IS GOING ON IN ITS NEIGHBOUR 
BURMA 
IT'S A TALE OF TWO DISASTERS BURMA IN THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY THEY 
CLEVERLY CONTRAST THE DIFFERENT 
APPROACHES OF AUTHORITARIAN 
GOVERNMENT THE CHINESE ARE 
APPEALING FOR AID ARE OPEN ARE 
POURING THEIR OWN SOLDIERS IN AND 
ALLOWING THE MEDIA FREE ACCESS 
WHILE IN BURMA WHICH HAS BEEN HIT 
BY CYCLONE NARGIS THE REGIME IS 
PARANOID IT'S XENOPHOBIC IT'S 
RESTRICTING AID IT'S TRYING TO 
KEEP THE MEDIA OUT IT'S QUITE A 
CONTRAST IN ONE WAY BURMA IS HOW 
CHINA WAS THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO BUT 
NOW P. IT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH 
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S OPENING UP 
SKPHIBGICALLY MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE 
THE OLYMPICS ARE COMING SOON 
ALTHOUGH THE CORRESPONDENT 
CLIFFORD CUNAN MAKES THE POINT THAT 
WHEN THE TROUBLE ERUPTED IN TIBET 
EARLIER THIS YEAR THE CHINESE 
ADOPTED A MUR M. E. E. S. STYLE APPROACH 
TO THAT AND TRIED TO KEEP THE MEDIA 
OUT 
BURMESE OUT MOST PEOPLE FIND IT HARD TO GET 
THEIR HEADS AROUND THIS STORY THE 
IMAGES OF THE AMERICAN SHIPS OFF 
THE COAST THEY SAY THE HELICOPTERS 
ARE HALF AN HOUR AWAY WITH AID 
IT'S SO HARD TO GET INTO THE 
MINDSET OF SAYING NO TO THAT 
IT IS 
THE REGIME THE GENERALS THAIN SE 
INITIAL AND HIS CRONIES ARE 
TERRIFIED OF ALLOWING OUTSIDERS IN 
IT'S CRUEL BEYOND BELIEF WHEN THE 
SAID THERE A LOT OF PRESSURE ON 
THE GOVERNMENT TO SORT OF BACK A 
BERLIN STYLE AIRLIFT AND PARACHUTE 
IN AID MOST OF THE AID 
ORGANISATIONS THE N. G. O. S. THINK THAT 
DOESN'T WORK 
LET'S HAVE LOOK AT STORY HERE 
IN THE SUNDAY MIRROR THIS IS KAREN 
MATTHEWS HAS SHE WRITTEN TO HER 
FAMILY COMPLAINING ABOUT BEING 
INSIDE 
SHE'S WRITTEN TO HER INSIDE PARENTS JUNE AND GORDON PRETTY 
MUCH IN DESPAIR IT'S A HAND

LETTER COME TO LIGHT 
SHE'S WRITTEN 
TO HER PARENTS 
HER PARENTS HAVE 
GIVEN IT TO THE PAPERS PRESUMABLY PRESUMABLY THEY'VE PASSED IT ON TO THE SUNDAY 
MIRROR THIS WOMAN KAREN MATTHEWS 
WAS NEVER OUT OF THE NEWS SIX 
MONTHS AGO AND THEN YOU KIND OF 
LOSE THEM INTO THIS LEGAL BLACK 
HOLE BEFORE THE TRIAL COMES IN 
THERE IS VARIOUS BITS OF THE LETTER 
BLACKED OUT BY THE SUNDAY MIRROR 
WHICH I IMAGINE RELATE TO THE TRIAL 
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED 
OF PREJUDICING THE TRIAL SHE'S 
ACCUSED OF NEGLECT AND PERVERTING 
THE COURSE OF JUSTICE IT'S A 
REMINDER SHE IS STILL THERE YOU 
READ IT AND YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL 
SORRY FOR HER WHEN YOU READ IT 
THE MAIL ON SUNDAY CHERIE BLAIR 
AND JOHN THE WORM WHAT IS THIS 
JOHN THE WORM CHERIE BLAIR AND HER 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY THIS IS GREAT SHE'S 
REVEALED EVERYTHING A MAN WHO WENT 
ON ABOUT PRIVACY HAS BEEN VERY FREE 
WITH HER OWN PRIVACY SHE GOT 
CAUGHT IN A LOVE TRIANGLE BEFORE 
TONY BLAIR A LAWYER AND A LAD IN 
LIVERPOOL AND THEN TONY BLAIR CAME 
IN THE MAIL ON SUNDAY HAVE TRIED 
TO WORK OUT WHO JOHN THE WORM IS 
THE TIMES NAMED ANOTHER Q. C. BUT 
THEY WERE WRONG THEY HAD TO 
APOLOGISE THE MAIL ON SUNDAY 
RECKON IT'S A JOHN MAIL Q. C. HE SAYS 
HE HAS NOTHING TO SAY L. DON'T 
BLAME HIM IF IT IS HIM IN HER BOOK 
SHE DESCRIBED HIM AS OVERKEEN 
CLINGY BORING FRIENDS AND LIKED TO 
POLISH HIS SHOES 
SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN THERE WOULD BE 
A BIG INQUEST INTO WHO IT WAS THAT THAT IS THE MILLION POUND QUESTION WHEN 
SHE SIGNED UP FOR HER SERIALISATION 
CAN I QUICKLY LOOK AT THIS STORY 
IS THIS WHAT WE ARE ALL GROWING 
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE APPARENTLY APPARENTLY PEOPLE WANT TO BE HEALTHY AND 
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH FOOD PRICES A 
FIVE YEAR WAITING PLACE FOR AN 
ALLOTMENT 
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ALLOTMENT ONE 
NO BUT I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ONE HAVE WAITED THAT LONG 
IT'S YOUNG 
WOMEN MAINLY A YOUNG WOMAN IS 
SHOWING A LOT OF CLEAVAGE IN THIS 
PICTURE 
HAVE YOU GOT AN ALLOTMENT PICTURE NO 
DO YOU GROW YOUR OWN FRUIT AND NO VEGETABLE 
NO A FEW HERBS IN THE VEGETABLE GARDEN L. WILL START 
NEXT TIME 
BRING SOME WITH YOU 
KEVIN THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH 
COMING UP IN THE NEXT HALF AN HOUR 
ON BREAKFAST 
WEDDING BLISS AS AUTUMN REIGNS 
WAS SHE RIGHT TO GIVE UP HER 
CATHOLICISM SO HER HUSBAND CAN 
REMAIN IN LINE TO THE THRONE 
GOOD MORNING YOU ARE WATCHING 
BREAKFAST OUR MAIN STORIES THIS 
MORNING THE PRIME MINISTER HAS 
SAID HE WILL VOTE IN FAVOUR OF 
RESEARCH USING ANIMAL HUMAN HIGH 
BRED EMBRYOS IN A CRUCIAL VOTE IN 
THE COMMONS TOMORROW WRITING IN 
THE OBSERVER HE CHALLENGES CRITICS 
WHO HAVE LABELLED THE RESEARCH AS 
FRANKENSTEIN SCIENCE AND SAYS THE 
TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TO 
SAVE AND TRANSFORM MILLIONS OF 
LIVES OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT 
IS HERE HE HAS LET M. P.'S VOTE THE 
WAY THEY FEEL THEY SHOULD VOTE ON 
THIS BUT HE HAS VERY CLEAR AND 
STATED POSITION HERE DOESN'T HE HE HE DOES I THINK IT IS SUR PRIZEING HE 
COME S. OUT VERY STRONGLY IN FAVOUR 
OF THE ADVANCES THAT WOULD ALLOW 
MORE STEM CELL RESEARCH BECAUSE HE 
SAYS IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT EXTENDING 
SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IT COULD 
CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES WHAT HE MEAN 
BY THAT IF YOU ALLOW STEM CELL 
RESEARCH SCIENTIST COULD COME UP 
WITH REMEDIES FOR PAX PARKINSON'S 
DISEASE OR ALZHEIMER'S OR CANCER SO 
MAJOR DEDISEASES HE BELIEVED COULD 
BE CURED THAT SAID IT IS HUGELY 
CONTROVERSIAL WHICH IS WHY HE IS 
HAS SAID TO LABOUR MPIOUS HAVE A 
FREE VOTE DAVID CAMERON AND NICK 
CLEGG HAVE SAID THE SAME TO THEIR 
M. P.'S THEY SAY THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT 
IDEOLOGY THIS IS ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL 
PERSONALLY AS A MATTER OF 
CONSCIENCE AND SO ON THIS ISSUE M. P.'S 
WILL HAVE A FREE VOTE SO ALTHOUGH 
THE PRIME MINISTER IS SIGNALLING HE 
BACKS THESE SORT OF CHANGE THERE 
IS NO PARTY WHIP OR DISCIPLINE ON 
M. P.'S TO SUPPORT HIM MEANWHILE MEANWHILE THERE IS A SORT OF SYMBOLIC 
OCCASION AND A LOSS FOR GORDON 
BROWN IN POTENTIALLY IF THE POLLS 
ARE TO BE BELIEVED WITH THE CREWE 
BY ELECTION ON THURSDAY WHAT ARE 
THE POLLS SHOWING AT THE MOMENT 
THEY ARE BLEAK AND IF YOU ARE 
GORDON BROWN GETTING UP THIS 
MORNING I GUESS YOU WANT TO HIDE 
UNDER THE DUVET BECAUSE THE POLLS 
ARE AWFUL IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
NATIONAL POLLS THEY SAY DAVID 
CAMERON HAS TWENTY POINT LEAD WHICH 
IS ROUGHLY IN THE BALLPARK OF TONY 
BLAIR HAD WHEN HE CAME INTO POWER 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CREWE AND AMP NANTWICH 
POLLS THEY GIVE LABOUR THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT THAT 
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE TORIES ARE 
GOING TO WIN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
THAT IT IS NOT JUST ANOTHER BY 
ELECTION CREWE AND AMP NANTWICH HAS BEEN 
LABOUR SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR IT IS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE 
ON THE LIST OF TORY TARGETS SO IT 
WAY DOWN THE LIST IF THEY WERE TO 
WIN THAT THEN I SUSPECT MANY 
PEOPLE WOULD SIGH IT AS PIVOTAL 
MOMENT IN POLITICS AND THINK IS THE 
TIDE GOING OUT ON GORDON BROWN 
MAYBE THE MOMENTUM BIBEHIND DAVID 
CAMERON IS UNSTOPPABLE WHICH IS WHY 
YOU HAVE SEEN BOTH PARTIES POUR 
RESOURCED RESOURCES IN THOUSANDS THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN IN BURMA COULD DIE OF 
STARVATION UNLESS FOOD REACHES THEM 
THE CHILDREN SAY 
AS MANY AS THIRTY THOUSAND YOUNGSTERS IN THE 
IRRAWADDY REGION WERE FALL 
MALNOURISHED BEFORE THE CYCLONE HIT 
AID AGENCYS ARE STILL TRYING TO GET 
ACCESS TO THE REGION IN RESCUE 
WORK IN CHINA HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY 
AFTERSHOCKS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
IS URGING PEOPLE NOT TO GIVE UP 
AND HAS PRAISED THE SUPPORT IT HAS 
BEEN GIVEN FROM ROUND THE WORLD IT 
SHOULD BE SIMPLER TO BUY A TRAIN 
TICKET IN ADVANCE FROM TODAY RAIL 
OPERATORS HAVE SCRAPPED THEIR 
INDIVIDUAL DEALS IN FAVOUR OF ONE 
PREBOOKED TICKET CALLED SIMPLY AN 
ADVANCE TICKET IT WILL BE 
AVAILABLE ACROSS THE WHOLE NETWORK 
THE AMERICAN SNAD FOR EDWARD 
KENNEDY IS UNDERGOING TESTS AFTER 
HE WAS RUSHED TO HOSPITAL SUFFERING 
A SEIZURE HE WAS LATER SAID TO BE 
LAUGHING AND JOKING WITH FRIEND 
HIS BROTHERS PRESIDENT JOHN F. 
KENNEDY AND ROBERT WERE BOTH 
ASSASSINATED IN THE SIXTIES FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
MEN AND SOME WOMEN HAVE SPENT THE 
NIGHT WALKING THROUGH LONDON IN 
THEIR UNDERWEAR THEY HAVE BEEN 
BEEN TAKING PART IN A CHARITY 
MARATHON CALLED MOONWALK THEY SAW 
BRA CLAD ENENTRANTS DOING A CIRCUIT 
STARTING FROM HYDE PARK LOTS OF 
WOMEN HANDFUL OF MEN I UNDERSTAND 
LIKE ONE HUNDRED OR SO MEN GOOD FOR THEM 
LET US GET THE SPORTS NEWS WITH SUE 
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU WORE WERE 
ENJOYING THE MAT FOS FEAR IN 
PORTSMOUTH 
I THINK TODAY IT WILL PORTSMOUTH BE MORE BOISTEROUS THAN ON FRIDAY 
THERE WAS A SENSE OF EXCITEMENT ON 
FRIDAY 
MORE SO TODAY I IMAGINE FRIDAY MOREING MORNING TO YOU TENSS OF 
THOUSANDS OF FANS WILL LINE THE 
STREETS AS POMPEY CELEBRATE THEIR 
FIRST F. A. CUP VICTORY SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
THE HOME COMING PARADE WILL SEE THE 
TEAM IN AN OPEN TOP BUS SO EVERYONE 
WILL BE ABLE TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF 
THE FAMOUS TROPHY AT LAST THEY 
HAVE DONE IT A FIRST F. A. CUP FOR 
HARRY REDKNAPP A FIRST IN SIXTY NINE YEARS 
FOR PORTSMOUTH AND A FIRST EVER 
PLACE IN EUROPE ALL IN ALL NOT A 
BAD DAY'S WORK 
MY FAMILY 
SPECIALLY THE FAN THE PLAYERS IT 
IS GREAT YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN A 
DIFFICULT YEAR OFF THE FIELD SO TO 
COME HERE NOW WITH WIN THE F. A. CUP 
IS A DREAM COME TRUE AND AND PORTSMOUTH WIN WAS A STORY OF ONE 
MAN'S REDEMPTION WHEN KANU MISSED 
THAT NEITHER HE NOR HIS MANAGER 
COULD BELIEVE IT IT MIGHT HAVE 
COME BACK TO HAPBT PORTSMOUTH BUT 
MINUTES LATER ENCKELMAN FUMBLE AND 
KANU SNAFFLED HIS CHANCE THE 
RELIEF WAS PLAIN TO SEE CARDIFF 
CERTAINLY CAUSED PROBLEMS AND HAD 
THE REFEREE NOT SPOTTED A HANDBALL 
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN LEVEL 
THAT IS 
WHAT I THINK IT WAS GIVEN FOR BUT BUT FEW COULD BE GRIDGE REDKNAPP OR 
PORTSMOUTH THEIR MOMENT OF GLORY 
HE IS A LEGEND NOW FIRST WIN 
FIRST CUP IN SEVENTY NINE YEAR HATS OFF WE WE HAVE GIVEN IT EVERYTHING WE HAVE 
GOT WE HAVE DONE EVERYBODY PROUD 
NO ONE THE BLAME EVERYBODY HAS HAD 
A HAN FANTASTIC DAY IT IS HARD 
TO SWALLOW WHEN YOU LOSE 
SO AFTER 
A F. A. CUP FULL OF SHOCKS THE FINAL 
FOLLOWED THE FORM BOOK IT WAS 
HARDLY A CLASSIC MATCH BUT FOR 
PORTSMOUTH IT WAS THE PERFECT 
RESULT ROCHDALE ARE GOING TO 
WEMBLEY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR 
ONE HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY AFTER THEY BEAT 
DARLINGTON IN THEIR LEAGUE TWO PLAY 
OFF SEMIFINAL BEN MUIRHEAD IS THE 
TOAST OF THE TOWN SCORING A DESEE 
SIEVE SPOT KICK THEY HAVE THE 
CHANCE TO ESCAPE THE FOURTH TIER OF 
ENGLISH FOOTBALL IT WILL BE A MASS 
EXODUS TO WEMBLEY FROM THAT PART OF 
THE COUNTRY BECAUSE STOCKPORT ARE 
THROUGH TO THE PLAY OFF FINAL IT 
FINISHED TWO TO ONE ON AGGREGATE AFTER 
CHASING FOUR TROPHIES FOR A LONG 
TIME RANGERS ARE CONTEMPLATING THE 
PROSPECT OF JUST A CUP DOUBLE 
WINNING THE S. P. L. IS OUT OF THEIR 
HAND AFTER THEY COULD ONLY MANAGE A 
DRAW YESTERDAY IT'S A TURN ROUND 
FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO CELTIC ARE IN 
THE DRIVING SEAT BECAUSE THEY LEAD 
BY THREE POINTS WITH ONLY GUN ONE 
GAME FOR THEM TO GO THEY HAVE A 
SUPERIOR GOAL DIFFERENCE EVEN 
THOUGH RANGERS HAVE A GAME IN HAND 
CELTIC HAVE THE BETTER GOAL 
DIFFERENCE CHRISTIAN DAILLY WAS 
THE UNLIKELY HERO OF RANGERS 
YESTERDAY AS THEY LOOKED ON THE ON 
THEIR WAY TO CLAIMING THE WIN THAT 
WOULD HAVE KEPT THE DESTINATION OF 
THE TITLE IN THEIR HANDS BUT A 
CHRIS PORTER EQUALISER AFTER THE 
BREAK MEANS THE ADVANTAGE LIES WITH 
THEIR RIVALS ACROSS THE CITY THE 
WEATHER PROSPECTS LOOK BETTER FOR 
ALL OF US TODAY NEVER MIND AT 
LORDS AFTER RAIN WASHED OUT MOST OF 
THE PLAY YESTERDAY BETWEEN ENGLAND 
AND NEW ZEALAND AFTER THREE STOP 
START DAYS ENGLAND LOOK TO BE IN A 
STRONG POSITION ONLY FIFTY THREE BALLS WERE 
BOWLED YESTERDAY IN THAT TIME 
ALASTAIR COOK MADE HIS HALF SENT 
THAT WAS HIS SEVENTEENTH FOR ENGLAND NOW 
HE WILL BE HOPING IT WON'T BE BUT 
IT COULD BE FORMER ENGLAND RUGBY 
CAPTAIN LAWRENCE DALLAGLIO'S LAST 
GAME FOR WASPS TODAY THEY PLAY 
BATH IN THE PLAY OFF SEMIFINAL HIS 
EIGHTEEN YEAR PLAYING 
BEEN 
SPENT AT ONE CLUB AND HE IS SET TO 
RETIRE AT THE END OF THE SEASON 
HIS CLUB HAVE HAD AN INCREDIBLE 
SECOND HALF TO THE SEVEN SEASON 
THEY HAVE WON TEN OUT OF THEIR LAST 
ELEVEN MATCHES THAT SEQUENCE HAS SWEPT 
THEM TO SECOND AND SET UP A 
POSSIBLE SHOT AT THE TITLE DECIDER 
IN TWO WEEKS TIME 
FOR A CLUB LIKE 
WASPS YOU ARE THERE TO WIN TROPHIES 
YOU ARE THERE TO COMPETE AT THE END 
OF THE SEASON REGARDLESS WHETHER I 
WAS RETIRING THIS YEAR OR NEXT 
THIS WOULD BE MY AMBITION I THINK 
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THINGS ARE 
CLEARER I KNEW IN MY MIND I WAS 
GOING TO RETIRE AT THE END OF THE 
SEASON YOU CAN PLAN FOR THAT AND 
YOU CAN DEAL WITH THE EMOTIONS BIT 
BY BIT RATHER THAN THEM COMING AT 
ONCE I AM LUCKY TO BE IN CHARGE OF 
THAT DECISION RATHER THAN THAT 
BEING MADE THROUGH INJURY OR 
SOMETHING ELSE SOY FEEL LUCKY IN 
THAT WAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IT 
SAINT HELENS HAVE MOVED UP TO SECOND 
IN THE SUPER LEAGUE TABLE FOLLOWING 
A VICTORY OVER THE CATALAN DRAGON 
YESTERDAY CHRIS FLANNERY GOT 
SAINTS OFF THE MARK JAMES GRAHAM 
AND A SEAN LONG KICK MADE IT SIXTEEN TO ZERO 
AT HALF TIME THE CATALANS CAME 
BACK IN WITH A STYLISH ADAM MOGG 
TRY ONE OF TWO FOR THE PERPIGNAN 
OUTFIT SAINTS FINISHED IT OFF WITH 
A COUPLE OF TRIES OF THEIR OWN 
INCLUDING ONE FROM AIDE GARDENER 
DANI PEDROSA WILL START ON POLE 
POSITION IN LE MANS TODAY HE STOLE 
POLE POSITION FROM COLIN EDWARDS 
CASEY STONER AND VALENTINO ROSSI 
WILL START FROM THIRD AND FOURTH 
JORGE LORENZO PUT SOME HAIRY 
MOMENTS BEHIND HIM TO QUALIFY IN 
FIFTH DESPITE TWO FRACTURED ANKLES 
WHILE JAMES TOSELAND WILL START ON 
THE THIRD ROW EVERY TIME YOU WATCH 
THAT YOU THINK THERE IS NOT 
IT IS FUNNY YOU MENTION THAT I WAS 
TALKING TO A POLO PLAYER WHO TOLD 
ME HE RODE AND PLAYED IN A MATCH 
THREE WEEKS AFTER HE HAD BROKEN HIS 
ANKLE YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT WOULD 
BE POSSIBLE IT IS TESTAMENT TO THE 
WAY THE INJURIES CAN BE TREATED BUT 
IT IS TESTAMENT TO THEIR COURAGE 
AND BARRY SHEEN WAS MOSTLY METAL BY 
THE END OF HIS RACING CAREER IT IS 
AMAZING IF YOU HAVE BROKEN ANY 
LIMBS PLAYING SPORT OR HAVING JUST 
AN ACCIDENT AT HOME YOU KNOW HOW 
PAINFUL IT IS L. GET BIT OF 
HAYFEVER AND I HAVE TO LIE IN A 
DARKENED ROOM 
THANK YOU HELL THROW A RUMOURED 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AUTUMN KELLY CONVERTED TO 
CATHOLICISM TO MARRY THE QUEEN'S 
GRANDSON PETER PHILIPS CAPTURING 
THE EVENT WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER FROM 
HELLO MAGAZINE BUT WAS THE BRIDE 
RIGHT TO CONVERT SO HER HUSBAND 
COULD REMAIN IN LINE TO THE THRONE 
THIS WAS SIMILAR CHOICE WASN'T IT 
FOR AUTUMN KELLY IF HE WAS TO 
REMAIN IN LINE TO THE THRONE SHE 
COULDN'T BE CATHOLIC 
NOTHING TO 
DO WITH REMAINING IN LINE TO THE 
THRONE H. HE IS SO FAR DOWN THE 
FOOD CHAIN WHEN HE WAS BORN HE WAS 
NUMBER FIVE WITH THE VARIOUS 
MARRIAGE AND THE CHILDREN THAT 
HAVE COME ALONG HE IS NUMBER ELEVEN AND 
WILLIAM AND HARRY GET MARRIED AND 
THE DUKE OF YORK'S CHILDREN GET 
MARRIED HE WILL MOVE FURTHER DOWN 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PRETTY MASSIVE 
DISASTER TO GET RID OF THE OTHER 
TEN 
IT IS NOT ABOUT THAT ABOUT TEN ABOUT THAT AT ALL IT IS ABOUT CHOICE 
HER CHOICE AFTER ALL THEY WERE 
GETTING MARRIED IN SAINT GEORGE'S 
CHAPEL AND PROBABLY THE MOST SHE 
COULD HAVE GOT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
BLESSING IT IS HER CHOICE AND I 
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE GRUDGE HER 
AND RELIGIOUS IS RELIGION IS 
ABOUT CHOICE YOU EITHER CHOOSE TO 
PRACTICE IT OR NOT AND IT WAS HER 
CHOICE 
I THINK IT WAS THE WRONG CHOICE CHOICE I MEAN IT IS CONCEIVEABLE 
THAT SHE DECIDED ON THE BASIS OF 
THE VERY CONSIDERED THOUGHT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND WAS THE 
RELIGION IN WHICH SHE LIVED BUT ON 
THE FACE OF IT GIVEN SHE WAS 
GETTING MARRIED TO THE GOOD 
EVENING'S QUEEN'S GRANDSON IT MAY 
HAVE BEEN SOCIALLY MOTIVATED SO 
PART OF HER UPWARD MOBILITY WAS TO 
TAKE THE RELIGION IN ORDER TO FIT 
IN WITH THE GRAND FAMINE TO WHICH 
HE WAS GETTING MARRIED 
IF SHE 
WANTED TO REMAIN ROMAN CATHOLIC 
WOULD HE HAVE HAD TO RENOUNCED HIS 
PLACE IN THE LINE UP 
YES AS MR. 
ARBITER SAID IT WOULD HAVE TO BE 
KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS SCENARIO 
TEN OTHER PEOPLE BIT THE DUST 
BECAUSE THERE WAS A PRACTICAL 
POSSIBILITY SO I THINK WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT AND ATTEMPT AT SOCIAL 
CONFIRMTY BUT IT WOULD ARISE IN THE 
CASE IF KATE MIDDLETON WERE TO 
MARRY THE PRAIL'S SON 
WE HAVE HAD 
THIS MESSAGE FROM SUE WHO SAYS ONE 
WONDERS IF SHE WAS A PRACTISING 
CATHOLIC IF NOT THE CONVERSION IS 
NEITHER HERE NOR THERE HER MOTHER 
SAID SHE WAS PROUD OF HER RELIGION 
HER MOTHER WOULD EVERYBODY IS 
BEING POMPOUS IT'S A MATTER OF 
CHOICE IT IS A INDIVIDUAL CHOICE 
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ACCESSION 
SHE CHOSE TO CHANGE IN THE WAY 
THAT LOT OF PEOPLE CHOOSE TO 
CHANGE AND DOES IT REALLY MATTER 
CAT LICKS WILL SAY YES IT DOES 
MATTER 
YES IT JOLLY WELL DOES THE MATTER REAL DIFFERENCES IN DOCTRINE 
TRADITION BETWEEN THE CHURCH OF 
ENGLAND 
IT DOESN'T MATTER IT IS ENGLAND ABOUT WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IN GOD OR 
NOT I WOULD BE CONCEIVEABLE THAT 
PETER PHILIPS COULD HAVE DONE IT 
THE OTHER WAY ROUND AND HE COULD 
HAVE SAID TELL YOU WHAT ELEVENTH IN 
LINE TO THE THRONE DOESN'T REALLY 
MEAN ANYTHING I WON'T HAVE THAT 
THEY DESUEDED WHICH WAY IT WAS 
GOING TO GO WE HAD A SIMILAR 
SCENARIO WHEN PRINCESS MICHAEL OF 
KENT MARRIED PRINCE MICHAEL HE 
DROPPED OUT OF LINE OF SUCCESSION 
BECAUSE SHE WAS A CATHOLIC HE HAD 
A QUIET WEDDING IN AUSTRALIA SHE 
HAD A BLESSING BY CARDINAL HUME 
NOBODY MADE A FUSS THEY CHOSE TO 
GO THE OTHER WAY HE IS PLAIN MR. 
PHILLIPS SHE IS MRS. PHILLIPS HE 
IS NOWHERE NEAR THE THRONE QUITE 
FRANKLY IT DOESN'T MATTER MELANIE MELANIE AS A CATHOLIC DO YOU FEEL 
SENSITIVE ABOUT AUTUMN KELLY'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS ROMAN CATHOLICISM 
OR THE ROYAL FAMILY'S ATTITUDE TO 
ROMAN CATHOLICISM 
IT'S A CHOICE 
THAT YOU MOVE ON FROM THE CHURCH AS 
A MEANS OF UPWARD MOBILITY IN 
ORDER TO CONFORM TO THE SOCIAL 
ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S COMPLETELY 
UNNECESSARY SHE COULD HAVE GOT 
MARRIED AT THE CHAPEL IN WINDSOR 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN UEKARISTIC 
SERVICE 
DICKIE CAN I ASK ONE SERVICE QUICK QUESTION THE QUEEN PARTY TO

THE WHIP TOTING ARCHAEOLOGIST IS 
BACK INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM 
OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL IS PREMIERED 
TONIGHT TONIGHT PICKING UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF NINETEEN 
YEARS AGO INDIE IS BACK EVEN IN 
THE FILM ITSELF THERE'S AN 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF HOW MUCH TIME 
HAS PASSED 
THIS AINT GOING TO BE 
EASY 
NOT AS EASY AS IT USED TO BE EASY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT AS GAMBLE 
BUT TO BE FAIR EVERY MOVIE I'VE 
EVER MADE IS A GAMBLE THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC ASKED ME 
AND HARRISON AND GEORGE AND ALL OF 
THE CAST MEMBERS WHO WERE IN THE 
MOVIE WERE ALWAYS ASKED NOT OFTEN 
BUT ALL OF THE TIME WHEN'S 
INDIANA JONES COMING BACK THIS IS 
WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO BASICALLY 
SATISFY NEED TO BRING THE 
CHARACTER BACK IT WAS SOMETHING 
HARRISON WANTED 
DELL ME ABOUT THE 
AUDIENCE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO 
THE FILM IS AIMED AT THIS TIME WERE 
NOT EVEN BORN OSTENSIBLY IN THE 
HEIGHT OF THE FIRST THREE FILMS WE WE DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE HAS BEEN ANY 
KIND OF TIME PASSAGE INDIANA JONES 
HAS BEEN AS FAR AWAY FROM AUDIENCES 
AS BASICALLY THE PUSH OF A BUTTON 
OR THE SLIPPING OF A CASSETTE INTO 
A PLAYER 
IT IS AN OLD FASHIONED MOVIE 
BECAUSE THE FIRST THREE FILMS WERE 
OLD FASHIONED WHEN I MADE RAIDERS 
OF THE LAST ARC I THOUGHT I WAS 
MAKING A B. MOVIE LIKE ALL OF THOSE 
MOVIES THAT CHARLTON HESTON USED TO 
BE IN LIKER RON FLYNN AND THE SEA 
HAWK THOSE WERE THE ICONIC B. 
MOVIES I REALLY LOVED GROWING UP 
WATCHING THEM ON TELEVISION I'M 
NOT THAT OLD I'M OLD BUT NOT THAT 
OLD HA HA NEEDED TO MODEL THIS OLD HA HA MOVIE TO BECOME KISSING COUSIN 
WITH THE FIRST THREE DIDN'T WANT 
IT TO BE THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM OF 
THE NEW GENERATION OF INDIANA JONES 
THERE'S NO DOUBT IT WILL BE A 
COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DOES IT MATTER 
TO YOU THAT IT'S A CRITICAL 
SUCCESS 
IT MATTERS TO ME THAT SUCCESS PEOPLE WILL GET IT AND ENJOY IT 
AND GIVE IT A BIRTH TOUCHING ANY 
ONE OF THE OTHER THREE MOVIES IN 
ANY ORDER THEY WANT TO PLACE IT 
FIRST LAST MIDDLE IT DOESN'T 
MATTER MATTER STEVEN SPIELBERG THERE

THING PART OF THE THEM NIST 
BRIGADE IN THE EARLY DAYS IN THE 
SEVENTIES AND EARLY EIGHTIES IT 
GOT US BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF WHAT 
WAS FELT TO BE THE EMFAN AT 
ALLISING OF WOMEN BUT AS I'VE GOT 
OLDER I DON'T MIND IT'S O. K. BUT I 
DO MIND VERY MUCH WHEN I'M WALKING 
ON THE STREETS AND YOUNG GIRLS HAVE 
BUILDERS USING THOSE WORDS IN A 
CRUDE WAY YOU CAN SAY SWEETIE 
AND MEAN COULD I UNDRESS YOU IN A 
VOICE AND THAT CAN STILL OFFEND ME 
I THINK THAT IS AWFUL 
MELISSA YOU 
HAVE EXPERIENCE OF BUILDING SITES 
AND WORK AS A PLUMBER YES YES TRADITIONALLY A TRADE ASSOCIATED 
WITH MEN AND NOT WOMEN YES WHEN YES WHEN YOU WATCH THAT CLIP AND IT WAS 
QUITE QUIET BUT IT GOT A LOT OF 
ATTENTION WHAT DO YOU THINK WHEN 
YOU HEARD HIM USING THAT WORD IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN I HEAR HIM USING 
FROM HOW IT'S OFTEN USED TO ME MY 
EXPERIENCE IT'S JUST USED OFTEN BY 
OLDER MEN WHO CAN'T REMEMBER MY 
NAME IN THAT WAY I DON'T FIND IT 
PARTICULARLY PAT RONISATION HE 
SOUNDED A LITTLE BIT PATRONISING TO 
BE HONEST WITH YOU BUT I DON'T 
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SWEETIE OR LOVE 
MYSELF PARTICULARLY 
IS IT BECAUSE 
OF THE WAY HE USED IT 
IT SEEMED 
THROWAWAY 
HE WAS TALKING TO A THROWAWAY REPORTER 
I'M NOT SURE IT DID SEEM REPORTER A THROWAWAY COMMENT L. DON'T KNOW 
AS I SAY IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE I 
HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CLIP BEFORE 
FROM SEEING THAT MY EXPERIENCE IS 
THAT I WOULDN'T BE PARTICULARLY 
OFFENDED BY IT L. UNDERSTAND WHAT 
YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT THE FEMINIST 
SIDE OF THINGS 
YASMIN WHAT DID 
YOU MAKE OF THAT PARTICULAR 
EXCHANGE 
IT WAS SO QUICK L. DON'T EXCHANGE THINK IT WAS THAT OFFENSIVE A PART 
OF ME THINKS IF IT OF HAD BEEN A 
MALE JOURNALIST WHAT WOULD HE HAVE 
SAID 
HE WOULDN'T HAVE SAID SAID SWEETIE 
THERE IS NO WORD MATE SWEETIE MATE YES THEY DON'T SAY THAT IN 
AMERICAN AMERICA

THE SAME CONOTATIONS 
I REALLY 
DON'T MIND PEOPLE SAY HORRIBLE 
THINGS TO ME WHEN THEY CALL ME

MY AGE SOMEONE SAYING YOU GIRLS 
ARE ALL LIKE THAT OR BABE I 
HATE THAT 
HAVE YOU HAD SOMEONE SAY

TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING HE SAID 
BABES LIKE YOU ARE ALWAYS MAKING A 
FUSS I WAS OFFENDED BY BOTH WHAT

IT'S INTERESTING 
I'M NOT BABE 
MELISSA YOU WILL 
KNOW THAT WOMEN WILL DO TO WIND A 
WOMAN UP IT CAN BE DONE THAT WAY 
ABSOLUTELY 
EVEN IN A JOKEY WAY IT ABSOLUTELY CAN BE DONE DELIBERATELY 
I'M A 
PLUMBER SO I OPERATE IN A MAN'S 
WORLD AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I 
FEEL I HAVE BROKEN DOWN BARRIERS 
FOR WOMEN SO IF THEY CALL ME 
BABE OR THEY CALL ME LOVE OR 
SWEETHEART THAT'S PATRONISE IF I 
LET THEM PATRONISE ME IT DOESN'T 
BOTHER ME L. WOULDN'T PERSONALLY 
BEING CALLED BABE OH THINK OH I THINK THERE ARE OTHER FIGHTS TO BE FOUGHT
