GOOD AFTERNOON FOLKS WELCOME TO 
THE DALELY POLITICS 
FEWER PARENTS ARE STAYING AT HOME 
TO LOOK AFTER THEIR FAMILIES THAN 
AT ANY TIME SINCE LABOUR CAME TO 
POWER AND A THIRD OF PARENTS THINK 
THIS IS DAMAGING THEIR KIDS' 
QUALITY OF LIFE SO IS THE 
GOVERNMENT DOING ENOUGH TO SUPPORT 
PARENTS WHO WANT TO STAY AT HOME TO 
BRING UP THEIR CHILDREN 
INFLATION RISES TO PER CENT AND FOOD PRICES 
ARE INCREASING AT THEIR FASTEST 
RATE SINCE RECORDS BEGAN CAN THE 
GOVERNMENT DO ANYTHING TO CURB THE 
RISING COST YOU 
NEEDING FIVE WEE 
A WEE 
BETWEEN CHERIE BLAIR AND MRS. HOWARD 
I'M BEGINNING TO KNOW MORE ABOUT 
POLITICIANS' LOVE LIVES THAN I CARE 
TO KNOW JUST STOP IT FROM NOW OWN 
THOSE OF US OF A GENTLE DISPOSITION 
WOULD NOT LIKE TO KNOW WITH US FOR 
THE SHOW IS JAMES WHALE JAMES IS 
CURRENTLY OUT OF WORK BECAUSE HE 
BACKED BORIS IN THE LONDON MAYORAL 
ELECTIONS WHICH MEANS HE HAS TIME 
TO SPEND WITH US 
I'M VERY VERY 
HAPPY TO SPEND IT WITH YOU NOW NOW THE INFLATION FIGURES WHICH JUST 
CAME OUT THIS MORNING IT IS NOW 
THE BIG STORY RUNNING ON ALL THE 
WIRES AND THE NEWS TWENTY FOUR CHANNELS THE 
ANNUAL RATE HAS JUMPED TO THREE PER CENT 
PREVIOUSLY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT SO THAT IS A BIG 
JUMP EVEN ON THE GOVERNMENT'S 
NARROW MEASURE RISING PRICES THE 
GOVERNMENT'S PREFERRED MEASURE IS 
THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AND EVEN 
THAT WAS WELL ABOVE EXPECTATIONS 
THE BIGGEST FACTOR WAS THE UTILITY 
BILLS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO PAY FOR 
FOOD AND DRINK AND THOSE PRICES 
PLAYED THEIR PART TOO FOOD IS NOW 
RISING AT ITS HIGHEST ANNUAL RATE 
SINCE RECORDS BEGAN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SO 
JAMES IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS 
FOR THE PRIME MINISTER 
I DON'T 
THINK HE COULD REALLY BE SURPRISED 
THAT THE INFLATION FIGURES HAVE 
GONE UP LOOK AT THE COSTS WHY HAS 
NOBODY DONE ANYTHING ABOUT THE 
RISING COSTS OF THE UTILITIES AND 
FOOD WHICH IS JUST GOING THROUGH 
THE ROOF 
PEOPLE WOULD SAY THESE 
ARE WORLD PRICE DEVELOPMENTS FOOD 
PRICES RISING ACROSS THE WORLD AND 
OIL IS HEADING FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS A BARREL 
AND WE HAVE NO CONTROL 
BUT THIS 
HAS GONE GOING ON FOR A LONG BUT 
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG 
TIME THE PRICES OF FUEL HAVE GONE 
UP AND THE FUEL COMPANIES ARE 
MAKING MORE AND MORE PROFITS AND 
THE GOVERNMENT IS MAKING ENORMOUS 
PROFITS JUST ON THE VAT WE PAY FOR 
FUEL 
I KNOW WHAT SOME WILL SAY FUEL THREE PER CENT MY PRICES ARE RISING BY MORE 
THAN THREE PER CENT IT'S HIGHER THAN THREE PER CENT 
THAT'S RIGHT DO REMEMBER WHEN FUEL 
PRICES REACHED EIGHTY P. AND PEOPLE GOT 
OUT OF THEIR CARS AND PROTESTED L. 
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE NOT 
CONTACTING THEIR M. P.'S MORE OR 
CALLING YOU OR GETTING IN TOUCH 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING MAYBE IT'S GOT 
TO DO WITH GLOBAL WARMING WHICH I 
DON'T AGREE WITH MAYBE WE JUST 
KEEP QUIET UNTIL WE SAY WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO PAY ANY MORE THEY'LL 
CARRY ON 
WELL WE'LL SEE IF THEY 
CONTACT THROUGH THE SHOW 
JENNY IS LEAVING US TO GO TO THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND 
I KNOW 
YOUR BOSS 
IF IT STAYS AT THREE PER CENT WILL HAVE TO 
WRITE A LETTER EXPLAINING THIS TO 
THE CHANCELLOR 
IF IS TIPS ABOVE PER CENT 
BUT IT WOULDN'T 
IF YOU WANT TO SEND IN ANY OF YOUR 
COMMENTS PERHAPS ABOUT INFLATION 
OR ANY OF TODAY'S STORIES DO GET 
IN TOUCH AND WE'LL READ OUT SOME OF 
YOUR THOUGHTS LATER IN THE 
PROGRAMME NOW THERE IS NOTHING 
WRONG WITH BEING AT HOME IN THE DAY 
TIME AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED 
AFTER ALL WHAT CAN BE BETTER THAN 
SITTING BACK ON THE SOFA WITH A 
PLATE OF SAG YETI BOLOGNESE AND 
WATCHING THE DAILY POLITICS BUT 
ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY MORE AND 
MORE PARENTS ARE RETURNING TO WORK 
UNWILLINGLY UNWILLINGLY IT SEEMS THAT MORE AND MORE PARENTS 
ARE BEING COMPELLED TO RETURN TO 
WORK SOONER THAN THEY WOULD LIKE 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE NOT WORKING IN 
ORDER TO LOOK AFTER THEIR HOMES AND 
FAMILIES HAS DROPPED BY FIFTH 
FROM TWENTY EIGHT MILLION IN ONE NINE ONE NINE THREE DOWN TO 
TWO POINT TWO MILLION TODAY OVER A THIRD OF 
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN THAT WERE 
SURVEYED SAID THAT BOTH PARENTS 
WORKED WITH ONE IN THREE WORKING 
PARENTS SPENDING LESS THAN FOUR 
WAKING HOURS A DAY WITH THEIR 
CHILDREN THIRTY TWO PER CENT OF WORKING PARENTS 
BELIEVED THEIR CHILDREN WOULD HAVE 
A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE IF THEY 
HAD STAYED AT HOME MEANWHILE THE 
NATIONAL UNION OF HEAD TEACHERS 
AGREE LAST WEEK THEY COMPLAINED 
THAT SCHOOLS ARE BEING EXPECTED TO 
TAKE OVER CHILDCARE 
RESPONSIBILITIES BUT GORDON BROWN 
EVER EAGER TO APPEAR FAMILY 
FRIENDLY SAYS THAT HE WOULD LIKE 
TO HELP HE'S PLANNING TO ENSURE 
THAT THE MOTHERS OF ALL PRIMARY 
SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE GIVEN THE RIGHT 
TO WORK MORE FLEXIBLE HOURS 
CURRENTLY THE MOTHERS OF CHILDREN 
UNDER THE AGE OF SIX ARE ENTITLED 
TO WORK PART TIME AND FLEXIBLE 
HOURS BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS SET TO 
RECOMMEND THAT THAT LIMIT IS 
DOUBLED UP TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE I'M JOINED NOW 
BY SUZY BROOKE WHO IS A MOTHER OF 
TWO AND WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE 
STAYED AT HOME WITH HER CHILDREN 
SUZY WHY DID YOU WANT TO STAY AT 
HOME 
WHEN I 
WAS GROWING UP MY MUM HOME WAS AROUND FOR BOTH MY BROTHER AND 
MYSELF AND IT WAS SOMETHING I WAS 
USED TO AND IT WAS SOMETHING I 
WANTED TO DO TO MOOR KIDS AS WELL 
WHAT ADVANTAGES WOULD THERE BE FOR 
THE KIDS' SAKE 
FOR THE KIDS' SAKE 
BEFORE I HAD THEM I ASSUME IT WOULD 
OFFER THEM I GUESS STABILITY AND 
CONFIDENCE AS THEY WERE GROWING UP 
MY MIND HAS CHANGED SLIGHTLY SINCE 
I'VE COME BACK TO WORK BUT PERHAPS 
WE'LL GET ON TO THAT IN A SECOND 
IN WHAT WAY HAS YOUR MIND CHANGED 
I CAME BACK TO WORK EARLY WHEN 
THEY WERE SIX MONTHS OLD THEY HAVE 
A VERY GOOD CHILDMINDER AND I HAVE 
A VERY GOOD SUPPORT MECHANISM IN 
THE SHAPE OF MY PARENTS AND OTHER 
FAMILY MEMBERS SO THEY ACTUALLY 
HAVE A LOT OF COUGHS AND A LOT OF 
STABILITY AND A LOT OF INTERACTION 
WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
AS WELL AS GOING TO NURSERY SCHOOL 
AND COMING 
OUT AS ACCEPTABLY 
SOCIAL CHILDREN 
SO YOU WOULD SAY 
YOU ACT AS A GOOD ROLE MODEL IN 
GOING BACK TO WORK AND CONTRIBUTING 
TO SOCIETY 
YES I HOPE SO L. HAVE 
A BOY AND A GIRL AND I HOPE THEY 
WILL BOTH VALUE PROFESSIONS AND 
APPRECIATE THE WORK OF IT BUT I 
WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT IS TOUGH GOING 
BACK TO WORK WITH YOUNG CHILDREN 
SO IF YOU HAD THE CHOICE 
FINANCIALLY TO STAY AT HOME WOULD 
YOU TAKE IT 
I THINK INITIALLY I 
SAID I WENT TO WORK WHEN THEY WERE 
SIX MONTHS OLD I WOULD HAVE LIKED 
TO HAVE STAYED AT HOME FOR A LITTLE 
LONGER HOWEVER NOW THEY ARE OLDER 
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME AS AN 
INDIVIDUAL AND NOW THEY ARE OLDER 
TO HAVE SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE 
CHILDREN 
SO IT WAS NOT A CHOICE CHILDREN FINANCIALLY 
ABSOLUTELY L. HAD NO FINANCIALLY CHOICE BUT TO GO BACK TO WORK WHEN 
THEY WERE SIX MONTHS OLD IF WE 
WANTED A HOUSE AND NAPPIES AND TOYS 
ET CETERA 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH STICKING WITH 
THIS SUBJECT IT IS BIG ONE FOR 
LOTS OF FAMILIES WE'RE JOINED BY A 
GOVERNMENT WHIP CLARE WARD WHO 
HAS JOINED US TODAY DESPITE BEING 
CURRENTLY ON MATERNITY LEAVE WHEN 
IS THE BABY DUE 
OH DEAR THAT'S A 
BIT OF A PROBLEM THE BABY IS THREE 
MONTHS OLD L. THINK A LOT OF MUMS 
WOULD UNDERSTAND JUST HOW DIFFICULT 
IT IS 
ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD 
CLAIM HUGE THINGS FOR ITS ECONOMIC 
RECORD ISN'T THE FACT THAT FOR A 
LOT OF ENDS TO MEET NOW BOTH 
PARENTS HAVE TO GO OUT TO WORK I I THINK SOCIAL TIMES HAVE CHANGED 
ALSO IN THAT LOT OF WOMEN HAVE 
HAD CAREERS BEFORE THEY SETTLED 
DOWN AND WANTED TO HAVE FAMILIES 
AND THEY'RE USED TO HAVING THEIR 
OWN MONEY AND INCOME AND IDENTITY 
AND A CAREER SO THAT HAS CHANGED 
THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO ARE STAYING 
AT HOME AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT 
WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU ARE TORN 
IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS BETWEEN 
WANTING TO BE WITH THEM AND GOING 
BACK TO WORK 
BUT A LOT OF PARENTS 
DON'T HAVE A CHOICE AND IT'S NOT 
WHEN THE KIDS ARE GETTING OLDER 
BUT IT IS WHEN THEY ARE ONE TWO 
AND UP TO PRIMARY SCHOOL BUT A LOT 
OF MOTHERS NOT ALWAYS BUT A LOT 
OF MOTHERS WOULD LIKE TO STAY WITH 
THEIR CHILDREN AT THAT TIME AND 
THEN GO BACK TO WORK BUT AT THE 
MOMENT THEY CANNOT MAKE ENDS MEET 
TO DO THAT THEY NEED TWO SALARIES 
IN THE FAMILY 
ABSOLUTELY THERE IS 
AN ISSUE OF CHOICE HERE AND AN 
ISSUE OF FINANCES FOR FAMILIES AND 
FAMILIES MUST MAKE THAT CHOICE 
WITHIN IT BUT YOU NEED TO TAKE 
INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS EXTENDED MATERNITY AND COUFD 
MATERNITY PAY 
BUT DOES THAT GIVE 
YOU A LIVING WAGE 
WELL IT HELPS 
I DON'T THINK ANY MAIN POLITICAL 
PARTIES ARE SUGGESTING WE ARE 
PAYING STAYING AT HOME MUMS A 
LIVING WAGE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
WHEN THEY EARNT BEFOREHAND BUT AN 
IMPORTANT POINT THAT SUZY MADE WAS 
THAT WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO WORK IT 
IS ALSO ABOUT ROLE MODELS OF 
WORKING MUMS AND GIVE YOUR 
CHILDREN ALTERNATIVE PEOPLE TO BE 
ABLE TO GROW AND LISTEN TO AND PLAY 
WITH I FIND MY CHILDREN ARE 
EXACTLY THE SAME BECAUSE THEY ARE 
EXPOSED TO LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE AND 
THAT'S GOOD FOR THEM 
THERE IS A 
TORY THINK TANK WELL IT'S NOT A 
TORY THINK TANK BUT IS IT ON THE 
CENTRE OF RIGHT THEY'RE PROPOSING 
AN ALLOWANCE OF ALL MOTHERS OF 
CHILDREN UNDER THREE TO HELP WITH 
THEM STAYING AT HOME SHOULD THE 
GOVERNMENT LOOK AT THAT 
I THINK 
THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THAT THE 
DIFFICULTY IS YOU WOULD BE PAYING 
THOSE MOTHERS WHO COULD AFFORD TO 
LIVE AT HOME AND THAT WOULDN'T 
COVER THOSE MOTHERS WHO CANNOT 
AFFORD TO STAY AT HOME 
ONLY RICH 
MUMS CAN AFFORD TO STAY AT HOME NOW 
AND YOU WOULD BE GIVING MORE MONEY 
TO THOSE RICH MUMS FORTY CAN AFFORD TO 
STAY AT HOME 
YOU WOULD BE MEANS 
TESTING AND YOU'D BE SUPPORTING 
THOSE MOTHERS WHO COULD THINK THEY 
COULD JUST MANAGE TO STAY AT HOME 
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS ON THIS FEE 
L. THINK WE SHOULD BE HELPING PEOPLE 
WITH CHOICES WE HAVE THE 
CHILDRENS' CENTRES THAT PROVIDE 
QUALITY CARE FOR MUMS MAKING THE 
CHOICE TO GO BACK TO WORK THE BIG 
ISSUE FOR MUMS ONE WHETHER OR NOT 
THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE THEY CAN AFFORD 
TO SEND THEIR CHILD WHETHER THEY 
CHOOSE TO GO BACK TO WORK FULL TIME 
OR PART TIME WE'VE INTRODUCED THE 
CHILD TAX CREDIT AND THE CHILDCARE 
CENTRES AND THOSE ARE ABOUT 
CHOICES AS WELL L. HAVE TO STAY THIRTY SEVEN 
YEARS AGO MY MOTHER WAS IN XCTSLY 
THE SAME EXACTLY THE SAME POSITION 
SHE WAS NOT HIGH FLYING CAREER 
WOMAN BUT SHE HAD A JOB ALL ALL GOVERNMENT POLICY WOULD SEEM TO BE 
PUSHING PARENTS GIVING THE 
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO GO BACK TO 
WORK SOONER RATHER THAN LATER IS 
THAT GOVERNMENT POLICY 
I THINK 
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS GIVING MOTHERS 
THE OPPORTUNITY AND ENCOURAGEMENT 
TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK BUT BUT NOT PROVIDING THE MONEY 
NO AND 
PROVIDING THE SUPPORT IT'S ABOUT 
THE CHILDCARE CENTRES AND THE CHILD 
TAX CREDIT AND THE NURSERY PLACES 
FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS ALL 
OF THESE THINGS HAVE COME IN AND 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT 
AT THE END OF THE DAY SOCIAL TIMES 
HAVE CHANGED AND A LOT OF MUMS WANT 
THE BEST OF WORLDS THEY WANT 
CHILDREN AND THEY WANT TO BE ABLE 
TO GO BACK TO WORK AS WELL WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THEY DON'T 
SEEM TO HAVE THE CHOICE L. SUPPOSE 
AN OLDER GENERATION WOULD SAY IF 
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THE SAY 
IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THE 
KIDS DON'T HAVE THEM I I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I UNDERSTAND 
THAT PEOPLE WANT A CAREER AND KIDS 
BUT WE DON'T VALUE MOTHERS MY 
BROTHER AND HIS WIFE STRUGGLE TO 
RUN A LITTLE RESTAURANT AND THE 
INTERESTING THING IS THEY HAVE TO 
FIT THEIR KIDS AROUND THE WORK AND 
CHILDCARE BUT IF SOME RULES AND 
REGULATIONS FOR PATERNTS AND 
MATERNITY COME OUT THEY PATERNITY 
AND MATERNITY COME OUT THEY WON'T 
BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THAT SORT OF 
STAFF BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD 
THE PAYOUTS AND IF PEOPLE GET MORE 
MONEY THEY'LL HAVE THE CHILD AND 
GIVE IT TO THE NANNY AND GO BACK TO 
WORK I THINK WE HAVE TO VALUE 
MOTHERS MY WIFE STAYED AT HOME 
BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO SUPPORT HER 
I HAD A JOB IN THOSE DAYS AND 
THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT THAT WAS 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO UNTIL SHE 
GETS TO AN AGE WHEN SHE IS GETTING 
FIVE PENSION THEN THE GOVERNMENT SAY 
OH YOU DIDN'T WORK ENOUGH TO GET 
A PENSION AND WHAT IS A SLAP IN 
THE FACE THAT IS 
YOUR MAJORITY IS LESS THAN TWELVE HUNDRED SO 
YOU COULD SOON HAVE LOTS OF TIME TO 
SPEND WITH YOUR CHILDREN 
I HAVE A 
TWO YEAR OLD AND A THREE MONTH OLD 
YOU COULD BE SPENDING LOTS OF TIME 
OF THEM 
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT JOB AS 
THE M. P. FOR WATFORD AND A GOVERNMENT 
WHIP I AM NOW STARTING TO EASE 
BACK INTO WORK A LITTLE BIT EARLIER 
THAN PERHAPS MOST MUMS WOULD WHEN 
THEY TAKE MATERNITY LEAVE GOOD GOOD LUCK WITH A FAMILY THANKS FOR 
BEING WITH US 
SCIENTISTS SAY CARBON DIOXIDE 
LEVELS AND THE ATMOSPHERE ARE 
HIGHER THAN AT ANY OTHER POINT OF 
THE LAST SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS THEY SAY 
EMISSIONS WILL HAVE TO BE CUT TO 
THEIR DANGEROUS GLOBAL WARMING 
GILES WENT TO DEVON TO MEET SOMEONE 
WHO WANTS US TO ABANDON AN OIL 
BASED LIFESTYLE 
TOTNES IN DEVON IN FULL SUNSHINE 
AND IT MAKES YOU THINK GLOBAL 
WARMING HAS ITS BONUSES FIFTEEN OR SO 
WELL MEANING AND DETERMINED 
RESIDENTS ARE TRYING TO PERSUADE 
THIS TOWN OF EIGHT THOUSAND THAT THEIR 
LIFESTYLE NEEDS TO CHANGE IT'S IT'S QUITE SIMPLE WE HAVE TO MEET THE 
TWIN CHALLENGES OF OIL RUNNING OUT 
AND CLIMATE CHANGE THE TWO ARE 
INTIMATELY LINKED UNLESS WE START 
NOW THE SMALL THINGS WORKING IT 
UP WE WILL NEVER GET THERE FOR FOR JULIAN THAT MEANS CHANGING ALL 
ASPECTS OF LIFE INCLUDING OUR DIET 
WE HAVE THREE ALMOND TREES SMALL 
ALMOND TREES AND THEIR RAN ONLY 
THREE OF THEM YOU WON'T FEED A 
POPULATION OF EIGHT THOUSAND ON THESE AND 
THERE ARE ONLY 
WE ARE NOT 
INTENDING TO THESE WILL BE MUCH 
BIGGER AND THERE WILL BE MORE OF 
THEM THEY ARE A WONDERFUL STAPLE 
FOOD THEY ARE EXTREMELY NUTRITIOUS 
THEY WERE THE STAPLE OF MANY PEOPLE 
IN THIS COUNTRY THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
AGO 
IF SOMEBODY SAYS TO YOU WE AGO WILL CHANGE YOUR DIET BACK IN THAT 
BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
THEY WILL THINK YOU ON THAT THEY THEY MAY WELL DO BUT I DON'T MIND WHEN 
THEY FIND THAT THEIR PRESENT STATE 
POLL PRICES LIKE WHEAT AND RICE ARE 
GOING UP IN PRICE ALMOST ALL THE 
FOOD WE GETTING TARTNESS IS TRUCKED 
IN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOCALISE 
THE ECONOMY WE GET IN TOTNES 
LOCALISING THE ECONOMY HAS MEANT 
CHANGING THE CURRENCY I'M STANDING 
IN TOTNES' OWN MINT THESE ARE 
TOTNES POUNDS MONOPOLY MONEY IT IT IS FOR SPENDING YOU CAN SPEND THEM 
AND SEVENTY BUSINESSES AT THE MOMENT 
THAT WILL ONLY INCREASE 
I HAVE 
TOTNES POUNDS YOU TAKE THESE 
EXCELLENT A PACK OF THIS LOCAL 
STREAKY SMOKED PLEASE FANTASTIC 
WHAT MADE YOU TAKE THESE BASICALLY BASICALLY CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY ASKED IF WE 
WOULD PLAN AND TAKING THEM THEN WE 
LOOKED INTO IT AND IT IS BASICALLY 
A WAY OF KEEPING TOTNES MONEY 
WITHIN TOTNES 
THAT COULD BE GREEN 
PRINTERS TO MAKE THE TOTNES POUND 
WITHOUT USING OIL BASED CHEMICALS 
THEIR STAFF TRY IT CARS TO WORK 
BACK AT THE HOW DO GET AROUND 
THAT 
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHERE OUR THAT WORKFORCE COMES FROM AND WHAT 
MARKET PLACES WE ARE SERVING 
CAN I 
KEEP THESE NO 
THIS QUIET NO REVOLUTION IS RATHER BRITISH THEY 
ARE NOT FIRST BY BEING CALLED 
BONKERS ALTHOUGH TOTNES HAS NOT 
YET CARFRAE YOU CAN STILL GO TO 
THE SUPERMARKET AND YOU DO NOT 
DOUBT THEIR COMMITMENT FREE OF 
CARS WHEN WE DO A FILM WE DON'T 
LIKE TO SHOW YOU HOW IT IS MADE 
JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW SERIOUS THESE 
PEOPLE ARE THIS IS WHAT TURNED UP 
AT THE STATION TO PICK US UP WE 
ARE BIKING AROUND TOTNES THERE ARE 
A FEW HILLS HAVING SAID THAT THEY 
HAVE POINT THE ONLY EMISSIONS 
ARE THE SWEAR WORDS OUT OF MY 
MOUTH MOUTH HEAVY BREATHING CHILD HE IS 
OBVIOUSLY FIT OR NOT STAR WE ARE 
JOINED BY TONY JUNIPER FROM FRIENDS 
OF THE EARTH OR NOT TO WHEN 
OIL WAS GETTING UP TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS PER 
BARREL AND UTILITY BILLS ARE GOING 
THROUGH THE ROOF WE ALL BECOME 
GREEN BECAUSE OF THE PRIZE THEY 
DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE LECTURED ON 
BEING MORE GREEN 
ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THE 
DISCUSSION ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND 
THE BUILD UP OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN 
THE ATMOSPHERE IS BEING FOCUSED 
MORE BY PARALLEL TRENDS EMERGING IN 
TERMS OF RISING FOOD AND ENERGY 
PRICES THESE THINGS ARE LINKED 
TOGETHER THEY ARE HAVING AN IMPACT 
ON THE FOOD SO IS THE CLIMATE 
CHANGE CLIMATE CHANGE HAS LED TO 
OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS 
WHICHEVER WAY YOU LOOK AT THESE 
ISSUES WE HAVE TO BEGIN A 
TRANSITION OUT OF THE FOSSIL FUEL 
AGE TOWARDS MORE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY 
IT IS FANTASTIC PLACES LIKE TOTNES 
ARE SHOWING LEADERSHIP THAT 
TRANSITION MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN IN 
ENGLAND AND TOTNES IS SHOWING RIGHT 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY SPREADING L. 
HAVE BEEN TOO MANY MEETINGS WHERE 
COMMUNITIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO 
BEGIN THE PROCESS OF CLEANING OUR 
DEPENDENCE ON OIL AS PART OF A 
DEPENDENCE INSURANCE POLICY FOR 
THE FUTURE 
CAN I BRING A NEW 
JAMES 
I'M ONE OF THE GREENEST JAMES PEOPLE 
YOU WILL EVER MEET BRING BRING YOU IN JAMES 
MY WIFE AND I HAVE 
AN ALLOTMENT L. L. DRIVE EVERYWHERE I 
POSSIBLY CAN L. DUNNO WHETHER TONY 
AND I I THINK WE HAVE ARGUED ABOUT 
THIS SORT OF THING BEFORE BUT 
FIRST OF ALL I DON'T WANT TO SEE 
THE PLANET DISAPPEAR BUT THE 
PLANET WILL IF THAT IS WHAT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN CLIMATE CHANGE IN 
MY VIEW IS A NATURAL PHENOMENON 
IT IS SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS HAS AND 
ALWAYS WILL HAPPEN THIS THING 
EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING 
WHICH I THINK YOU WILL AGREE IS A 
MISLEADING QUOTE 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
THERE IS A WHOLE RANGE OF DIFFERENT 
PHENOMENA GLOBAL AVERAGE 
TEMPERATURES ARE INCREASING NOT NOT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
YOU CAN DRAW A LINE 
BETWEEN ANY TWO TELEGRAPH THEY THEY HAVE NOT INCREASED FOR TEN YEARS ANY TO POINTS ON A GRAPH 
INEXORABLY THE EARTH IS GETTING 
WARMER THERE IS A SENSE OF ALARM 
BEING EXPRESSED BY THE SCIENTIFIC 
COMMUNITY YES JAMES THERE HAVE 
BEEN GLOBAL WARMING IS IN THE PAST 
IT CAN BE NATURAL BUT THIS ONE IS 
NOT IT IS TO DO WITH DEFORESTATION 
IT IS PROVEN 
IT IS NOT PROVEN 
WOULDN'T WE JUST HAVE A BETTER 
WORLD IF WE DIDN'T BURN SO MANY 
FOSSIL FUELS HAD A BETTER 
ENVIRONMENT THE WATER WAS CLEAN 
AIR YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE IN 
GLOBAL WARMING TO THE GREEN THE 
WATER WAS MORE CLEAN 
IF YOU WANT 
TO BE GREEN YOU CURB THE WORLD'S 
POPULATION THE MOST POLLUTING 
THING ON THE WORLD IS THE HUMAN 
BEING THERE ARE TOO MANY TOO 
WASTEFUL 
YOU WANT TO CULL THE WASTEFUL WORLD'S POPULATION 
I DIDN'T SAY 
THAT 
MY JOB IS TO MAKE THE HIGH THAT CONSUMING BITS OF IT TO MAKE THEM 
TO LOOK AT THEIR ENERGY AND 
RESOURCE CONSUMPTION THE 
PRODUCTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE IS 
MANY TIMES HIGHER THAN INDIA AND 
CHINA PER CAPITA IN THIS COUNTRY 
HE IS RIGHT IT IS HIGHER PER 
CAPITA 
AS FAR AS THE WORLD IS CAPITA CONCERNED IT IS MINISCULE IF WE 
DIDN'T FLY AND HOLIDAY OR DRIVE OUR 
CARS IT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE 
FLY ON HOLIDAY 
I DON'T THINK WE 
WILL RESOLVE THIS ISSUE 
IT IS A 
SCIENTIFIC FACT WE HAVE TO REACT 
AT A MATTER OF URGENCY 
AT IT 
DEPENDS WHICH SCIENTISTS TO TALK 
TO 
THEY ARE NINETY PER CENT CERTAIN THAT WE TO HAVE A PROBLEM IF YOU WERE NINETY PER CENT 
CERTAIN THAT YOUR PLANE WOULD CRASH 
YOU WOULD NOT GET ON IT 
WE ARE 
BEING LIED TO THAT IS THE PROBLEM 
WE'RE BEING TOLD LIES SO THEY CAN 
TEXT US MORE 
CAN WE SAY THAT WE 
HAVE RESOLVE THE ARGUMENT YOU ARE 
BOTH AGREED AND YOU WILL MOVE ON 
WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO 
SORT IT OUT 
THANK YOU 
THERE IS A FAMILY SEEMED TO THE 
PROGRAMME TODAY WE HAVE DONE 
WORKING MUMS AND NOW WE WILL TALK 
ABOUT MARRIAGE AS FROM A THEME 
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING ARTUR THEIR 
POLITICAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH 
INTIMATE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE 
MARRIAGE OF TONY AND CHERIE AS IF 
THAT WAS NOT EMBARRASSING ENOUGH 
IT WAS THE TURN OF FORMER 
CONSERVATIVE LEADER MICHAEL HOWARD 
TO REVEAL ALL ABOUT HIS POLITICAL 
PARTNERSHIP 
MICHAEL IS MY WHOLE WORLD HE HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN THERE AND WONDERFUL FOR 
ME 
I FEEL SANDRA IS PART OF ME L. ME THINK I AM ONE OF THE LUCKIEST 
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD REALLY TO 
FIND HER 
HERE ARE YOUR QUESTIONS 
WHO HAS 
THE UGLIEST TOES WHO HAS THE WORST MANNERS IT'S A MATTER WHO IS THE BEST KISSER YES 
MICHAEL HOWARD THE BEST KISSER 
JOINING US NOW IS AN EXPERT ON 
POLITICAL PARTNERSHIPS THE 
JOURNALIST LINDA MCDOUGALL 
I'M NO 
GOOD AT KISSING 
AREN'T YOU AM 
I AM NOT PREGNANT EITHER WOULD YOU 
BELIEVE I'M NOT PREGNANT THANKS THANKS FOR LETTING US KNOW L. SAID YOU 
WERE AN EXPERT YOU ARE AN EXPERT 
PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY YOU 
HAVE WRITTEN A BIOGRAPHY OF CHERIE 
BLAIR BUT YOU ARE MARRIED TO A 
LABOUR M. P. YOU SPEAK WITH SOME 
AUTHORITY AND POLITICAL 
PARTNERSHIPS 
IT IS AUSTIN MITCHELL PARTNERSHIPS BUT YOU KNOW THAT 
WHAT MAKES A 
GOOD POLITICAL PARTNERSHIP PERHAPS PERHAPS NOT HAVING TOO MUCH POLITICS IN 
COMMON THAT IS QUITE USEFUL L. 
THINK IF YOU AGREE ABOUT EVERYTHING 
ABOUT POLITICS THAT MIGHT BE 
DANGEROUS I'M NOT GOING TO TELL 
YOU THAT I HAD CONCEIVED ANY 
CHILDREN AT BALMORAL BUT I CAN 
TELL YOU THAT I AM A SECRET 
SCOTTISH NATIONALIST 
THAT MUST 
MAKE FOR INTERESTING BREAKFAST 
TABLE CONVERSATION IT IS VERY BIG 
IN GRIMSBY 
I KEEP ASKING ASKED HIM 
IF HE WILL DEFECT BUT HE WON'T IT 
IS QUITE USEFUL IF YOU HAVE VIEWS 
THAT ARE A BIT A BIT DIFFERENT 
AS LONG AS YOU AGREE ON THE MAIN 
THINGS LIKE WHERE TO GO FOR YOUR 
HOLIDAYS AND THAT YOU BOTH LIKE THE 
SAME KIND OF PAINTINGS ON THE 
WALL 
THEN THE POLITICS CAN GO WALL HANG 
SO IT WOULD SEEM L. AM HANG FASCINATED EVERY MORNING BY THE 
REVELATIONS FROM CHERIE BLAIR BY 
ALMOST GO TO BED DREAMING ABOUT 
WHAT IT MIGHT BE I ALMOST TONY 
SHOUTED AT HER THIS MORNING THE 
TRUEST LINE I HAVE EVER READ HE 
SAID I TOLD YOU NOT TO BEAR IT 
BY ANY BLOODY FLOWERS THAT IS THE 
SORT OF THING ANY MAN WOULD SAY 
WHO HAS THE BEST STRATEGY IS 
CHEERY WHO HAD AN INDEPENDENT 
CAREER WHEN SHE WAS IN NUMBER TEN 
DID HER RUN THING IS IT CHERIE 
BLAIR IS IT SARAH BROWN AND HAS 
GIVEN UP THE CAREER STANDS BY HER 
MAN AND MORE OLD FASHIONED WAY I I DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT YOU HAVE SAID 
ABOUT SARAH BROWN SHE IS DOING A 
VERY PROFESSIONAL JOB 
HER JOB IS 
TO SUPPORT HER HUSBAND 
SHE IS A 
PUBLIC RELATIONS PERSON IT IS HER 
JOB THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU ARE 
AN INDEPENDENT MINDED PERSON AND A 
BIT GABBY LIKE CHERIE BLAIR OR ME 
IT IS JOLLY HARD IN PUBLIC MEETINGS 
AND IF YOU ARE IN DOWNING STREET 
YOU HAVE TO QUADRUPLE WHAT IT IS 
FOR THOSE HUMBLE PEOPLE IN GRIMSBY 
IT IS JOLLY HARD TO SIT AND SAY 
NOTHING WHEN YOU DISAGREE WITH WHAT 
YOUR HUSBAND IS SAYING WHEN YOU 
HEAR HAS BEEN GOING ON YOU ALWAYS 
THINK YOU COULD HAVE SAID THAT 
BETTER I GUESS THAT CHERIE IS NOW 
SORT OF IN A WAY TAKING REVENGE 
I FIND IT VERY UNPLEASANT AND I 
THINK SHE HAS GONE TOO FAR 
LETTING IT ALL OUT 
IF YES COULD COULD ENSUED AS TO THE DOOR THEN 
I AM 
SAYING I UNDERSTAND 
COULDN'T SHE 
JUST KEEP IT ALL IN 
WHO WOULD WANT 
TO READ A LOT OF PEOPLE I 
PRESUME WANT TO READ WHAT CHERIE 
BLAIR THINKS L. AM SO FED UP BOARD 
AND I QUITE FRANKLY WISH THE BLOUSE 
HAD NEVER EXISTED IN BRITISH 
POLITICS THE BLAIRS THE FACT 
THAT THEY HAVE HAD THIS THING WITH 
GORDON BROWN AND THEY HAVE BEEN SO 
BUSY ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER ON ON THIS AND CONTROVERSIAL POINT WE 
HAVE TO MOVE ON 
THE QUIZ ANSWER

INVITED TO BE UKIP'S MAYORAL 
CANDIDATE I SHOULD HAVE DONE WE WE THANK ALL OF OUR GUESTS LINDA 
MCDOUGALL AND JAMES WHALE WE WILL 
BE BACK AT ELEVEN THIRTY AM TOMORROW 
WEDNESDAY WITH PRIME MINISTER'S 
QUESTIONS IT SHOULD BE A CRACKER 
WE WILL HAVE LIVE COVERAGE OF 
GORDON BROWN UNVEILING HIS POLICIES 
FOR THE YEAR AHEAD FOR NOW 
GOODBYE
