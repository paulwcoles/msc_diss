GOOD AFTERNOON IT IS RAINING 
OUTSIDE BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 
THE WORLD SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS HAVE EVER BEEN HELD 
IN THIS COUNTRY AND A TEMPORARY 
POOL HAS BEEN PUT IN HERE AT THE 
ARENA WE ARE ON DAY THREE AND 
THIS IS WHO WE ARE LOOKING OUT FOR 
TODAY TODAY REBECCA ADLINGTON WAS ON THE ANCHOR 
LEG OF THE RELAY TEAM WHO JUST 
MISSED OUT ON THE GOLD SHE WAS ON 
HER OWN IN THE EIGHT HUNDRED FREESTYLE AND WE 
WILL FIND OUT HOW SHE DID 
LIAM TANCOCK IS A MAN AT HIS BEST 
WHEN ON HIS BACK THE NEW WORLD 
RECORD HOLDER HAD THE NIGHT OF HIS 
LIFE AND WE WILL BE MARVELLING AT 
MARK FOSTER AND HE IS STILL FLYING 
IN THE FIFTY M. FREESTYLE 
I AM JOINED THIS AFTERNOON BY 
ANDREW JAMESON AND SHARRON DAVIES 
LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THEIR 
VIEWS 
ANDREW HAS PUT ON A CLEAN VIEWS SHIRT 
WHAT A RELIEF LET'S START SHIRT WITH THE MEN'S FOUR HUNDRED M. INDIVIDUAL 
MEDLEY ANDREW WAS IN THE COMMENTARY BOX 
WITH ADRIAN MOORHOUSE 
WE HAVE A GREAT CHANCE OF A BRITISH 
MEDAL HERE L. WOULDN'T LIKE TO SAY WHICH LANE IT IS GOING TO COME FROM CAN ANYONE GET ANYWHERE NEAR RYAN LOCHTE SO THE FINAL OF THE MEN'S FOUR HUNDRED M. INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY RYAN LOCHTE IS ALMOST THE COMPLETE 
PACKAGE MICHAEL PHELPS IS THE 
COMPLETE PACKAGE BUT RYAN IS NOT 
FAR BEHIND HIM THE BRITISH GOAL START GETTING 
WAVES SHORTLY AND THAT GETS MORE 
DIFFICULT LOCHTE AS EXPECTED IS 
OUT THERE QUICKLY HE DOES LOOK 
SLOW THOUGH THE GREEK WAS 
COMPLAINING OF BREATHING PROBLEMS 
BUT HE DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD AT THE 
MOMENT 
HE WAS GIVEN THE SILVER MOMENT MEDAL AT THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS 
IN EINDHOVEN A FEW WEEKS AGO LOCHTE IS THE ONLY ONE TO BE 
WEARING THE NEW SWIMSUIT THAT WE 
HAVE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
SWIMMERS DO COMPLAIN THAT WHEN THEY 
HAVE A FULL BODY SUIT ON WITH ALL 
OF THE FOUR STROKES IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO GET THE FULL RANGE OF MOVEMENT 
LOCHTE IS TWO SECONDS AWAY FROM 
WORLD RECORD SPLITS IN THE HEATS 
WE SAW HIM WORK THE BREASTSTROKE 
LEG SO WE CAN SEE WHAT HE 
WITH THIS 
HE WAS VERY LAZY INTO 
THIS TERM WHICH HAS MADE ME THINK 
HE IS NOT GOING FOR IT HE WAS MUCH 
LOWER ON THE BACKSTROKE THAN I 
EXPECTED HIM TO BE 
I AM WONDERING 
IF HE IS PRACTISING A PARTICULAR 
RACE PACE L. AM SURE HE IS CAPABLE 
OF BEATING THE WORLD RECORD MY 
THING HE IS DOING ENOUGH TO WIN THE 
GOLD MEDAL HE HAS THE CAPABILITY 
TO PLAY WITH THE FIELD LIKE THIS 
IF YOU LIKE WHICH IS A BIT 
UNFORTUNATE IF YOU ARE IN SECOND OR 
THIRD PLACE AT A WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
LOCHTE IS DOING CHAMPIONSHIPS ENOUGH BUT THE BRITISH GUYS ARE 
COMING BACK INTO IT YOU WON DALE 
HAS STARTED TO MAKE A MOVE THIS IS GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING LAST ONE HUNDRED M. HE LOOKED SO GOOD IN THE HEATS 
MAYBE LOCHTE IS DOING A BIT OF A 
CROWD PLEASER HE LOOKS A LAZY I'M 
NOT SURE IF HE 
IS TIRED OR LAZY HE HE IS GOING FOR THE GOLD MEDAL ONE 
OPTION IS GOING FLAT OUT FOR THE 
WORLD RECORD AND THE SECOND IS JUST 
DO ENOUGH TO WIN THE GOLD MEDAL AND 
SAVE YOURSELF FOR THE REST OF YOUR 
RACES IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IS WHAT 
HE IS DOING 
AGAIN HE LOOKS GOOD 
NOW I THINK HE IS PLAYING WITH 
THEM HE IS GOING TO BE THE WORLD 
CHAMPION A VERY GOOD SWIM INDEED 
I DO THINK HE PLAYED WITH THEM HE 
LOOKED VERY COMFORTABLE INDEED HE 
LOOKS TIRED NOW THOUGH THIS WILL 
ALSO GOING TO THE U. S. A. THE SILVER THE BRITISH GUYS ARE DOING THEIR 
BEST TIMES AND THAT IS ABOUT AS 
MUCH AS YOU CAN ASK AT THIS LEVEL 
IT IS GOOD STUFF TO TAKE INTO 
BEIJING FOR SOME REASON I AM A BIT 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT THE BRITISH 
GUYS HAVE TO BE HAPPY TWO LIFETIME 
BESTS FOR THEM WHAT WAS THIS GUY 
DOING 
HE SAID HE WANTED TO COME DOING HERE AND PRACTISE RACING HARD 
BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE HAS A BIG 
SCHEDULE IN BEIJING AS WE SAW 
MICHAEL PHELPS DO IT IS TOUGH TO 
GET UP WIND DOWN THEN RACE AND DO 
IT A FEW TIMES A DAY L. THINK 
LOCHTE IS PRACTISING THAT HERE AND 
I THINK HE 
IS FINDING IT HARD IT IT IS RACE NUMBER EIGHT IN A DAY AND A HALF HALF SO LOCHTE WORLD CHAMPION FOR THE 
U. S. A. THE SILVER ALSO GOING TO THE 
U. S. A. 
A GOOD SWIM A 
PERSONAL BEST B. S. B. S. PERSONAL BEST CANNOT COMPLAIN 
OBVIOUSLY I WANTED TO GET AMONGST 
THE MEDALS BUT I HAD TO TAKE FIFTH 
TODAY 
IT IS PART OF THE LEARNING TODAY CURVE I THINK LOCHTE WAS TOYING 
WITH EVERYBODY A LITTLE BIT YES YES HE HAS A FEW EVENTS HE IS PROBABLY 
DOING EVERY EVENT THERE IS HE IS A 
GREAT SWIMMER L. IMAGINE HE WOULD 
HAVE WANTED TO GO A LITTLE BIT 
FASTER 
THOMAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE FASTER FOR YOU BUT IT IS TOUGH TO BE IN 
THE MIDDLE 
I DID NOT SWIM AS AIRS 
AS WELL AS I HOPED BUT I HAVE 
NEVER BEEN IN A FINAL LIKE THAT OF 
THE THAT WILL GIVE ME MORE 
EXPERIENCE BEFORE BEIJING 
THAT IS 
TO FOUR OH NINE 
BUT STILL I WANTED TO OH NINE GO A LITTLE BIT FASTER 
ANDY WOULD YOU REASSESS YOUR 
JUDGEMENT OF RYAN LOCHTE NOW 
BECAUSE YOU WERE DOWNBEAT ABOUT 
HIM HIM I WAS JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO 
SOMETHING SPECIAL SOME FIREWORKS 
AND HE DID NOT BRING ANY HE JUST 
LOOKED LAZY NOW AND AGAIN AND HE 
WAS JUST WINNING TO WIN HE IS 
SWIMMING ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT 
RACES BUT I THOUGHT HE WOULD USE 
IT TO RACE REALLY HARD BECAUSE AT 
THE OLYMPICS YOU'LL HAVE TO RAISE 
HARD BECAUSE YOU CANNOT DO THAT IN 
THE OLYMPICS HE WAS LOAFING A BIT 
AND THEN HE GOES TO HIS LEGS AND HE 
TOOK OFF 
HE HAS OLYMPIC TRIALS 
COMING UP AND THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR 
HIM I THINK THIS IS A HIGH QUALITY 
TRAINING SESSION FOR HIM HE HAS 
TOUGH RACES COMING IN THE PROGRAMME 
HE IS KEEPING IT WITHIN HIS 
BOUNDARIES 
I KNOW I KNOW VERY BOUNDARIES LITTLE ABOUT SWIMMING BUT I 
NOTICED THOMAS HAVE FAILED ON THE 
STOCK BLOCKS GOT DOWN INTO A 
POSITION BEFORE ANY OTHER SWIMMERS 
AND THEN HAD TO HOLD HIS CROUCH 
LONGER THAN ANYONE ELSE THIS IS 
THE REVERSE ANGLE DO YOU SEE HE 
IS DOWN RYAN LOCHTE HAS ONLY JUST 
GONE DOWN 
THAT IS HIS PERSONAL 
STYLE THERE WERE A COUPLE OF 
OTHERS ON HIS RIGHT HAND SIDE THAT 
WENT DOWN IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR 
THOMAS BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO OUT ON 
HIS OWN AND CREATE A QUALIFYING 
TOWN HE REACHED HIS SECOND 
PERSONAL BEST WHICH PUT HIM RIGHT 
IN THE CENTRE 
IS IT DIFFICULT TO 
QUALIFY FASTEST AND COME OUT LAST 
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME AND THAT 
IS SOME WERE WHERE EXPERIENCE 
COUNTS ALL THE OTHER GUYS ARE OUT 
THEN YOU COME OUT AND YOU HAVE TO 
TAKE YOUR KIT OFF L. WOULD WORK IS 
A POP TRACKSUIT BECAUSE THEN YOU 
CAN UNZIP IT OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO 
TAKE IT OVER YOUR HEAD AND NEW 
HAT COMES OFF WOULD WAIT UNTIL 
EVERYBODY IS READY AND MAKE 
PEOPLE WAIT WHEN YOU ARE READY 
THEN YOU KNOW THE RACE WILL GO 
THEY HAVE A LIMIT ON THE TIME NOW 
THEY ONLY HAVE MINUTE BEFORE THEY 
BLOW THE WHISTLE 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
THE CONFIDENCE TO PUSH THAT AS FAR 
AS YOU CAN SPRINTERS DO IT IN 
ATHLETICS BUT JUST ONE TWITCH AND 
YOU'RE OUT 
FIFTY M. BREASTSTROKE FOR THE WOMEN 
KATE HEYWOOD WAS THE BRITISH 
SWIMMER IN THIS FINAL ALSO JUST A 
HARDY ZOE BAKER USED TO BE BRITISH 
NOW SWIMMING FOR NEW ZEALAND 
THE FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S FIFTY M. 
BREASTSTROKE THE WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER IN THREE KATE HEYWOOD OF 
GREAT BRITAIN IN SIX THE RUSSIAN DEFINITELY MOVED 
WHETHER SHE WAS STILL AT BY THE 
TIME THE GUN WENT I DON'T KNOW 
JESSICA HARDY HAS HAD A GOOD START 
THIS WILL BE INTERESTING BECAUSE 
SHE HAD A BAD START IN THE SEMI 
FINAL I'D BEEN SHE WAS THE FASTEST 
SWIMMER AND SHE IS LOOKING GOOD 
I THINK SHE WAS TWENTY NINE FIFTY EIGHT KATE HEYWOOD FROM GREAT 
BRITAIN HAS THE BRONZE THIRTY THIRTY FIVE SHE 
WENT WHAT A HUGE WORLD RECORD 
THAT WAS FANTASTIC WORLD RECORD 
JESSICA HARDY GOT A FANTASTIC START 
A LOT BETTER THAN THE SEMI FINALS 
WE KNEW SHE HAD THIS IN HER THAT 
SEMI FINAL WAS FAST SHE HAD A 
DODGY DIVE IN THE SEMI FINALS BUT 
SHE GOT IT RIGHT 
SHE DESTROYED IT 
ADRIAN 
SHE HAS TAKEN A YEAR OUT OF ADRIAN UNIVERSITY TO CONCENTRATE ON 
TRAINING 
THAT START OF THE RUSSIAN TRAINING SHE WAS DISQUALIFIED SO THAT 
PROMOTES KATE HEYWOOD FROM GREAT 
BRITAIN INTO THE SILVER MEDAL 
POSITIONS 
YOU CANNOT WHICH AT THE POSITIONS START WE JUST MISSED THE REPLAY 
THERE BUT THE RUSSIAN WAS WOBBLING 
I THINK IT PUT HER OFF ANYWAY SHE 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSER TO JUST A 
HARDY IN THIS FIRST LAND YOU JUST 
CANNOT TWITCHED AT THE START 
JESSICA HARDY PERFECT STROKE IT 
IS VERY EASY TO GET IT MIXED UP 
WITH THE LEGS AND THE ARMS SHE 
LOOKED FOR THE RESULTS ON THE CLOCK 
SHE IS A VERY HAPPY PERSON A WORLD 
RECORD BY THREE TENTHS OF A SECOND 
FOR JESSICA HARDY SHE HAD A 
SHOCKING SEMI FINAL THE WORST 
START I THINK I HAVE EVER SEEN 
WHAT A GREAT SWIM FOR KATE HEYWOOD 
KATE WELL DONE WELL DONE TO YOU 
BOTH COME ON IN HERE AS WELL 
FANTASTIC WORLD RECORD 
THANK YOU 
SO MUCH 
I AM SO EXCITED I KNOW 
YOU HAVE TAKEN TIME OFF TO 
CONCENTRATE IT WORKED

TIME OUT OF MY CLASS IT HAS BEEN 
FUN 
A SILVER FOR YOU A LITTLE BIT FUN OF TWITCHING AND IT PUT YOU TO 
SECOND 
I DID NOT REALISE AND NOW SECOND I 
HAVE JUST LOOKED AND REALISE 
I HAVE A SILVER AND KNOCK THE BRONZE I HAD TO RAISE MY RACE BUT I HAD A 
BAD FINISH L. WAS SURPRISED NOBODY 
TOUCHED ME OUT 
EQUALITY FIELD 
ACROSS THE BOARD 
YES GOOD RACING 
WELL DONE WELL DONE LADIES NOW THE MEDAL CEREMONY TWO OF THEM 
ON THE SILVER MEDAL PODIUM KATE 
HAYWOOD THE WONDERFUL EVENING FOR 
HER JUST WATCHING JESSICA HARDY'S 
BREASTSTROKE STYLE SHE IS LIKE A 
SEA WARS STRAIGHT UP OUT OF THE 
WATER 
THAT IS RIGHT 
SEAHORSE WATER THAT WAS ALL MY IS MY WEEK'S STROKE 
TO BE HONEST ALWAYS MY WEEK'S 
STROKE 
VERY ENCOURAGING FOR KATE STROKE HAYWOOD 
YES BUT WE DID NOT SEE HAYWOOD THE RUSSIAN GIRL TWITCHING WHICH 
MEANT THAT SHE WAS DISQUALIFIED 
THEY ARE VERY STRICT ON STARTING 
RULES IN SWIMMING THERE IS NO 
ALLOWANCE FOR FALSE STARTS 
ABSOLUTELY NONE MEDALS COMING 
THICK AND FAST FOR THE BRITISH TEAM 
NEXT IT WAS LIAM TANCOCK HIS BIG 
NIGHT NIGHT THE FIND OF THE MEN'S ONE HUNDRED M. 
BACKSTROKE AND A VERY GOOD LANE 
ASSIGNMENT FOR LIAM TANCOCK IT 
THE FINAL NOBODY WILL BE WATCHING 
HIM 
I WAS TALKING TO THE COACH HIM PAUL SIDE ABOUT ONE HOUR AGO 
POOL APPARENTLY IN THE MIDDLE IT 
IS WAVY AND SOME OF THE SWIMMERS 
HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING THIS IS LIAM 
TANCOCK THEY ARE PLEASED TO BE IN 
LANE AID 
IF YOU CAN CHOOSE IN A 
SHORT COURSE POOL THEN YOU WOULD 
PICK NO EIGHT THERE IS NO LANE NUMBER 
NINE ASHLEY DELANEY JUST ABOUT TO COME 
OUT FROM AUSTRALIA IN LANE TWO 
THERE HE IS HE WON THE TRIALS IN 
BACKSTROKE SO HE WILL BE IN 
BEIJING ROBERT HURLEY THE SECOND 
AUSTRALIAN JUST NINETEEN THE SECOND 
FASTEST OF THE OF ALL TIME ON THE 
FIFTY M. AND THE ONE HUNDRED M. BACKSTROKE 
FASTEST AUSTRALIAN 
IT IS TOUGH 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN AUSTRALIA THE 
HARDEST RAISING YOU WILL EVER SEE 
BUT MARKUS ROGAN IS A WILY AND 
EXPERIENCED CHARACTER HE DOES NOT 
GO OUT SO 
FAST WE 
EXPECT LIAM 
TANCOCK TO GO OUT VERY FAST BECAUSE 
HE IS A BIG SPRINTER RANDALL BAL 
WILL GO AT VERY FAST HE IS 
NOTORIOUS FOR THAT DO NOT COUNT 
HIM OUT BUT I THINK WE WILL SEE 
LIAM TANCOCK AND RANDALL BAL GOING 
OUT VERY FAST LAST YEAR AT 
RANDALL BAL WON EVERY EVENT AT FIFTY M. 
AND AT TWO HUNDRED M. HE NEVER REALLY LET 
VACATED IT AT LONG COURSE JUST 
SHORT COURSE REPLICATED IT AND 
HERE IS STANISLAV DONETS OF RUSSIA 
WE NEVER REALLY TALK ABOUT HIM WE 
DO TALK ABOUT LIAM TANCOCK THE NEW 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER ON FIFTY M. 
BACKSTROKE LONG COURSE FOR GREAT 
BRITAIN DOWN AT THE BOTTOM THAT 
WAS A GREAT SPAIN HE HAS GREAT 
SPEED SWIM 
WE DO NOT ABOUT 
STANISLAV DONETS BUT WE SHOULD 
BECAUSE HE HAS LED THE WORLD ALL 
YEAR HE IS ACTUALLY THE FAVOURITE 
THE GUY EVERYBODY HAD BEEN LOOKING 
AT 
ALL SO FOURTH FASTEST IN HISTORY AT ON ONE HUNDRED M. BACKSTROKE SO WE SHOULD 
LOOK AT HIM CAREFULLY BUT IT WILL 
BE INTERESTING BECAUSE ALL SORTS 
WILL HAPPEN HERE A LOT OF GOOD 
SPRINTERS THAT ARE NOT THE FASTEST 
QUALIFIERS WATCH OUT FOR TAN KOK'S 
FIRST FIFTY M. AT THE BOTTOM LIAM 
TANCOCK'S OF LIAM TANCOCK IS THIRSTY TURN BY A 
VERY LONG WAY HE REALLY BASHED OUT 
A HEAT THIRST TO TURN IT WILL 
BE WON OR LOST ON THE TURNS LIAM TANCOCK WILL STRUGGLE TO KEEP 
THIS GOING I THINK L. REALLY HOPE 
THAT HE DOES WATCH OUT FOR MARKUS 
ROGAN IN LANE THREE AND DELANEY IN TWO LIAM TANCOCK HAS GOT THE TOUCH 
FIFTY POINT ONE FOUR A MASSIVE NEW BRITISH RECORD 
BY THIRTEEN SECONDS THAT IS STUNNING A 
COMMONWEALTH RECORD AS WELL AND 
EUROPEAN RECORD THAT IS ONLY JUST 
OUTSIDE THE WORLD RECORD WHICH IS 
HELD BY RYAN LOCHTE OF THE U. S. A. I I FANTASTIC SWIM FOR LIAM L. WAS NOT 
SURE HE WOULD HOLD ON TO IT AFTER 
THE FIRST FIFTY BUT HE DID SECOND SECOND FASTEST IN HISTORY 
RYAN LOCHTE OR 
HAVING TO LOOK ON BECAUSE HE DID 
NOT ENTER THIS RACE BUT LIAM 
TANCOCK WAS MASTERFUL HE REALLY 
PLAYED TO HIS STRENGTH WHICH WAS 
TO GET OUT THERE HE OBVIOUSLY HAD 
SOMETHING LEFT IN HIS TANK THE 
REST OF THEM WERE NOT EXPECTING IT 
WE DID SAY IT THAT LANE IT WAS A 
GOOD ONE 
WE ALSO SAID THAT THE 
OTHERS WERE VERY GOOD SWIMMERS AND 
WE DID NOT PUSH LIAM TANCOCK ENOUGH 
WE ARE REALLY PLEASED FOR HIM THE THE WOMEN HAVE BEEN DOING SO WELL BUT 
NOW A MAN HAS GOT A MEDAL AND IT IS 
A GOLD MEDAL THE MEDAL TABLE AS 
GOALS AT THE TOP SO MEN ARE 
LEADING WOMEN AT THE MOMENT HAS 
GOLDS I SAID THAT THE RACE TO BE 
WON OR LOST UNDERWATER AND THAT 
WAS A SUPER TURN 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IS THE YEAR 
TO STEP UP 
GREAT READ AS WELL 
REACH FIVE THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE BRITISH RECORD 
WAS A FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FOUR WHICH HE SAID IN THE 
HEATS THE TIME THAT HE SAID IN THE TRIALS 
WAS AN INDICATION A REAL 
INDICATION OF HIS TALENTS AND HE 
HAS CONVERTED IT HERE COMMONWEALTH COMMONWEALTH RECORD EUROPEAN RECORD BRITISH 
RECORD 
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING WE RECORD WERE ALL HOLDING OUR BREATH THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH L. AM LOST FOR WORDS 
TO BE HONEST AN OUTSIDE SMOKER 
AFTER THE PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT A 
FEW PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN ME 
OFF BUT LAST WEEK WITH THE WORLD 
RECORD COMING IN HERE OUTSIDE 
SMOKER FROM LANE NO EIGHT I AM 
PLEASED 
IT IS NICE TO DO THAT PLEASED THEY WERE NOT EXPECTING YOU TO GO 
OUT SO FAST AND HANG ON TO THAT I I AM AN OUT AND OUT SPRINTER AND TO 
DO THAT SHORT COURSE I'M NOT 
REALLY KNOWN FOR MY SHORT COURSE 
SWIMMING ABILITY TO DO THAT IN 
SUCH A GOOD TIME I AM REALLY PROUD 
AND PLEASED FOR THE TEAM AS WELL A A GREAT START YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT BE 
SHORT COURSE THE MAYOR BUT YOU 
HAVE BY FAR THE BEST START 
I HAVE 
BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON MY START 
I AM NOT SURE ABOUT MY SPIRITS AND 
STUFF I WILL GO BACK AND FOCUS ON 
THAT FOR TOMORROW FOR THE FIFTY AND 
THE MEDLEY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE 
REST OF THE WEEK 
HOW IMPORTANT 
WERE THE CROWD L. BUMPED INTO YOUR 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY IN THE CORRIDOR 
THEY SPENT TWO HUNDRED ON A BANNER AND 
WERE NOT ALLOWED TO PUT IT UP BUT 
THEY MUST BE LOVING THAT MY MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY WILL BE REALLY 
CHUFFED MY PARENTS HAVE GOT THE 
BANNER AND IT IS VERY EXCITING TO 
BE IN FRONT OF A HOME CROWD AND 
THAT CHEERED ME ON 
OUR FIRST GOLD 
MEDAL HERE HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE 
SOME MORE 
LET'S HOPE SO THANK YOU 
HIS FAMILY WOULD HAVE MADE THE 
JOURNEY UP FROM EXETER WHERE HE WAS 
BORN HE LIVES IN PRAYER AND 
TRAINS AT LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY 
TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD LIAM TANCOCK THE TANK 
HE LIVES IN LOUGHBOROUGH A FABULOUS MOMENT FOR HIM I HAVE 
NOT SEEN HIM IN THE FLESH FOR A 
WHILE SO I HAVE PROBABLY NOTICED IT 
MORE THAN YOU BUT I THINK HE HAS 
MUSCLED UP 
THE BODY SHAPES TO 
CHANGE LATER FOR THE GUYS THAN FOR 
THE GIRLS HE HAS BEEN WORKING HARD 
IN THE GYM ON HIS POWER AND 
EXPLOSIVENESS BUT HE HAS GOT THAT 
NATURALLY BECAUSE HE STARTED OUT AS 
A FIFTY M. BREASTSTROKE SWIMMER HE HAD 
BEEN WORKING ON THE TURNS AS WELL 
BUT HE DOES SAY HE IS A LONG COURSE 
SWIMMER A HUGE POSITIVE FOR THE 
SUMMER 
THIS IS IMPORTANT OVER ONE HUNDRED M. SUMMER BECAUSE THERE IS NO FIFTY M. BACKSTROKE 
AT THE OLYMPICS HE HAS TO BE ABLE 
TO HOLD HIS OWN 
YES AND AT FIRST 
TWENTY FIVE WAS STUNNING WHEN I WAS 
COMMENTATING I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO 
QUICK BUT HE HAS TAKEN ON SOME OF 
THE BEST TURNERS IN THE WORLD YOU 
ONLY GET ONE TURN BUT YOU HAVE TO 
PRACTISE THEM THERE CAN BE NO 
MISTAKES AT THE OLYMPICS HE HAS 
JUST DONE THREE TURNS TAKING ON 
THE BEST GUYS IN THE WORLD AT 
TURNING HE IS ACTUALLY BEATING THE 
OTHERS AT EVERY TURN IN THE HEATS 
AND THE SEMI FINALS HE WENT REALLY 
FAST AT FIFTY BUT THEN HE FELL OFF 
BUT HERE HE KEPT ON ROLLING AND 
NEARLY BROKE THE WORLD RECORD THAT 
WAS A BRILLIANT SWIM THAT PUPPY 
FAT THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 
NICEST WAY TO TALK ABOUT IT HE DID 
HAVE PUPPY FAT HE IS TURNING IT 
VERY WELL AND IS LOOKING IN GREAT 
SHAPE FOR THE OLYMPICS 
I THINK HE 
IS MATURING AS AN ATHLETE BIG TIME 
HE IS THE FULL ATHLETE NOW HE DOES 
NOT GO IN AND DO IT BY MISTAKE BUT 
HE MEANS TO HIS PREPARATION IS 
EXTREMELY GOOD 
HE IS VERY SELF 
CONFIDENT BUT AT HIS BASE COMING 
OUT THERE VERY IMPRESSED WITH THAT 
LOOKED AT HIS FACE 
WHEN WE GET 
TO THE OLYMPICS HE WILL WALK ON TO 
THE START BLOCK THINKING THAT HE 
BELONGS HERE AND THAT HE CAN WIN 
AND A HUGE PART OF WINNING A MEDAL 
IS BELIEVING THAT YOU CAN 
HE IS A 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER AND WORLD 
CHAMPION THEY WILL SAY THAT JUST 
BEFORE THEY START 
AND HE HAS DONE 
IT FOUR ITS MONTHS BEFORE THE BIG 
GAMES JUST THE RIGHT TIME FOUR 
MANSE KIRSTY COVENTRY HAD BEATEN HANNAH 
MILEY IN THE INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY 
WITH WORLD RECORD SIMMONDS IS THE UN IS IN A FIELD 
BUT IF SHE GOES FOR I THINK SHE 
WILL GET A MEDAL YOUNGEST IN AT 
THE FIELD A LOT OF THESE WOMEN ARE 
VERY GOOD TWO HUNDRED M. BACKSTROKE IS KIRSTY COVENTRY IS THE OLYMPIC 
CHAMPION AT BACKSTROKE ELIZABETH 
SIMMONDS THE EUROPEAN CHAMPION 
ONE HUNDRED M. AND TWO OTHER BIDDERS SHE DID 
NOT HAVE GREAT FIRST TWENTY FIVE KATERINA ISINBAYEVA HAS A GREAT TURN 
IF 
SHE CAN GET A GOOD TURN TURN SHE HAS A CHANCE THAT SHE HAS TO 
REALLY BRING IT BACK THERE ARE 
SOME VERY STRONG WOMEN IN THERE 
KIRSTY COVENTRY COMING BACK 
KATERYNA ZUBKOVA AT THE MOMENT COVENTRY GOT THE TOUCH SHE DIED 
FOR THAT WALL A GREAT LESSON IN 
HOW TO DO YOUR STARTS TURNS AND 
FINISHES KIRSTY COVENTRY IS HAVING 
A BRILLIANT MEET 
KATERYNA ZUBKOVA 
HAD A TERRIBLE FINISH SHE FINISHED 
ZERO POINT ZERO FIVE BEHIND COVENTRY BUT EXPERIENCE 
SHOWS WITH JUST A BIT MORE 
EXPERIENCE OF THESE RACES SHE JUST 
ABOUT TIMES THAT TO PERFECTION 
VERY FAST SHE SET THE WORLD RECORD 
IN THE FOUR HUNDRED MEDLEY AND SHE HAS THE 
SECOND FASTEST TIME IN THE WORLD IN 
THE BACKSTROKE 
SHE IS SHOWING 
FANTASTIC FORM JUST BEFORE BEIJING 
THIS IS FANTASTIC FORM FOR THE 
OLYMPIC YEAR WE HOPE THAT THINGS 
WILL PROGRESS FOR BEIJING FOR HER IF YOU BREAK THE WORLD RECORD ON A 
FOUR HUNDRED M. INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY AND SHE 
JUST SAT THE SECOND FASTEST TIME ON 
THE ONE HUNDRED WHAT WILL HAVE TWO HUNDRED BE 
LIKE 
SHE BROKE IT LONG COURSE SO I LIKE EXPECTED TO BREAK IT HERE SHE IS A 
FANTASTIC FORM WHICH IS GREAT TO 
SEE 
KATERYNA ZUBKOVA TRAILING A SEE LITTLE BIT NOT HARD ENOUGH TO THE 
WALL SHE PACED IT JUST TO 
PERFECTION SHE WAS SECOND KIRSTY COVENTRY THE NEW WORLD 
CHAMPION ON THE ONE HUNDRED M. BACKSTROKE 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS WAS SEVENTH BUT SHE 
DID SWIM WELL JUST OUTSIDE HER BRITISH RECORD 
BUT A NEW CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD FOR 
KIRSTY COVENTRY OF ZIMBABWE ELIZABETH JUST OUTSIDE YOUR BEST 
TIME AND I KNOW YOU ARE HOPING TO 
GO A BIT QUICKER THAN THAT BUT A 
FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE FOR YOU 
DEFINITELY I HAVE HAD A HIP INJURY 
BEFORE THIS SO I HAVE NOT BEEN 
KICKING QUITE AS I WOULD LIKE A 
LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY 
DID NOT GO FASTER BUT IT IS ONLY 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MY BEST 
HOPEFULLY THERE IS MORE TO COME 
NORMALLY YOU START AND TURNS ARE 
VERY SHOP AND YOU LIKE THEM THE 
BEST IS YET TO COME 
YES TWO HUNDRED 
TOMORROW THE SHOCK CAUSED IS 
DIFFICULT WITH THE WAVES AND I WILL 
PUT THAT DOWN TO EXPERIENCE THE 
SHORT COURSE 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO 
YOUR TWO HUNDRED 
WE WILL SEE THAT LATER ON IN THIS 
PROGRAMME NOW WE HAVE THE MEN'S 
ONE HUNDRED M. BREASTSTROKE JAMES GIBSON IS 
IN LANE TWO WITH SOME BIG BLOKES 
IN THE MIDDLE JAMES GIBSON IS THE COMMONWEALTH RECORD HOLDER IN TWO GIBSON NORMALLY SNATCHES IT'S A 
LITTLE BIT AND GOES A BIT TOO TIGHT 
ON THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE NAME SEVENOAKS 
GOOD ADRIAN 
I WAS LOOKING TO SEE 
HOW GIBSON WOULD GO THE FIRST 
STROKE OR TWO WAS SNATCHED A LITTLE 
BIT BUT NOW HE HAS SETTLED DOWN HE WE EXPECTED THESE GUYS TO GO OUT QUICKLY THE REST OF THE FIELD ARE CATCHING UP THE UKRAINE IS IN LANE FOUR THAT WAS A VERY WELL 
PACED SWIM HE PACED THAT JUST RIGHT L. THOUGHT 
THE RACE WOULD BE AT THE BOTTOM OF 
THE POOL THE UKRAINE'S A VERY 
STRONG RIGHT NOW IN THIS EVENT THE 
LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS THE 
UKRAINE'S THE ONE HUNDRED M. SHORT COURSE 
PARTICULARLY HAVE SHOWN REAL CLASS 
THEY HAD THEIR TRIALS A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AGO ACTING BOTH THESE GUYS 
ARE QUALIFIED FOR THE REAL AND BIG 
GAMES 
THE TIME IS VERY FAST JUST GAMES OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN RECORD VANDENBERG FIFTY SEVEN NINETY TWO HAS BROKEN THE COMMONWEALTH RECORD NOBODY LIKES TO BE IN A RACE WHEN 
YOUR RECORD GET BROKEN 
IT HAS 
YOUR RECORD GET BROKEN IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME I DIDN'T SET 
THAT MANY RECORDS 
HE WE ARE USED TO YOU GOING OUT 
FROM THE START BUT IT LOOKS LIKE 
YOU DID NOT CLICK INTO IT I 
EXPECTED IT TO CATCH UP AND IT 
DIDN'T HAPPEN 
I WAS A LITTLE BIT 
RUSTY THOSE GUYS WENT QUICK AND I 
HAVE BEEN SUFFERING A LITTLE BIT 
SINCE LAST WEEK'S IN MY HEAD HASN'T 
BEEN IN IT L. HAVE GOT TO DO A GOOD 
JOB IN THE RELAY ON SUNDAY WE HAVE 
A GOOD JOB A GOOD CHANCE TO PICK 
UP SOME MEDALS WERE BURY'S BURY'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE YOU HAVE GONE 
OVER TO FRANCE TO WORK HARD AND 
TRAIN YOUR CELL WE DID EXPECT YOU 
TO MAKE THAT THE OLYMPIC TEAM 
I AM 
RANKED FOURTH OR FIFTH IN THE WORLD IN 
THE PROPER POOL IT IS A SHAME BUT 
MANCHESTER HAS PUT ON A GREAT SHOW 
IT IS A SHAME WE HAVE NOT GOT MORE 
SUPPORT IN HERE IT IS AN AMAZING 
ARENA AND THEY SHOULD BE PROUD OF 
PUTTING AN EVENT ON LIKE THIS WHAT WHAT IS NEXT FOR YOU IN THE NEXT FEW 
MONTHS WOULD YOU GO HOME AND THINK 
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO 
I DON'T 
THINK I CAN CALL IT A DAY QUITE YET 
BECAUSE OF THE TIME I DID L. AM 
LOOKING TO GO TO TWO THOUSAND TEN AND THEN I 
WILL REASSESS AFTER THAT 
JAMES GIBSON SOUNDING DISAPPOINTED 
WE WILL MOVE ON TO REBECCA 
ADLINGTON HE WAS TAKING PART IN THE 
LONGEST EVENT STAGED FOR WOMEN HERE 
THAT IS THE EIGHT HUNDRED M. FREE THEY ARE 
RACING FOR MEDALS JO JACKSON SWAM HIS STUNNING TWO HUNDRED 
HOW CAN SHE CONVERTED TO EIGHT HUNDRED 
IT 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT IT IS GREAT TO SEE THE TWO RELAY 
SWIMMERS COMING OUT IN THESE 
INDIVIDUAL EVENTS REBECCA 
ADLINGTON LOOKING CALM AND COMPOSED 
SHE LOOKS READY FOR IT L. SPOKE TO 
HER COACH AN HOUR AGO AND HE SAID 
HE HOPED SHE HAS ENOUGH IN THE TANK 
FOR THIS AND I'M SURE IT WILL BE 
THIS LADY WHO WILL CHALLENGE HER 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONS IN THIS AS WELL JO JACKSON WILL BE IN ONE I THINK 
THAT WILL BE A GOOD NAME FOR HER 
ELAINE THIS IS A PUNISHING RACE RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE PICTURE JO 
JACKSON OF GREAT BRITAIN THREE 
LANES FROM THE BOTTOM IN THE BLUE 
HAT IS REBECCA ADLINGTON HOW DOES JO JACKSON SWIM THIS 
RIGHT OF THE TOP 
SHE HAS GOT TO 
OUT FOR THE RACE THERE IS NOTHING 
BETTER THAN BEING IN AN OUTSIDE 
LANE IN FREESTYLE AND IF SHE WAS 
BREATHING ON HER RIGHT HAND SIDE 
SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE WHERE 
EVERYBODY IS OR SHE NEEDS TO DO 
HIS BRIEF ON THAT SIDE AND KEEP 
LOOKING AT THEM IN THE OLD DAYS I 
SWAM A COUPLE OF FREESTYLE RACES I 
ONLY WON A FEW THIS IS GOOD 
SWIMMING FROM THE BRITS ONE AND 
TWO AT THE MOMENT BUT THERE IS A 
LONG WAY TO GO 
THIRTY TWO LENSE IT IS A 
LONG RACE LENSE TWENTY SIX TO GO IT IS AN EDGE OF YOUR 
SEAT RAISED IT IS VERY DIFFERENT 
FROM SPRINTING AS WE MENTIONED 
THE FORM STARTS TO SHOW AFTER ABOUT 
TWO HUNDRED M. YOU GET FEEL FOR WHERE THEY 
ARE THE SWIMMERS WHO SHOULD BE IN 
THE LEAD WHETHER THEY ARE IN THE 
LEAD YOU EXPECT KATE ADLINGTON TO 
BE THERE JACKSON TO BE THERE KATE ADLINGTON HAS STARTED TO MAKE 
A MOVE HERSELF THE AUSTRALIAN IS 
SECONDS JO JACKSON HAS MOVED BACK 
INTO MAY BE EQUAL THIRD POSITION 
BUT KATE ADLINGTON DOES LOOK 
COMFORTABLE THIS IS OMINOUS FOR 
THE REST OF THE FIELD TWENTY TWO TO GO 
KATE ADLINGTON STARTING TO MOVE A 
WAVE 
SHE LOOKS REALLY GOOD WAVE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE A FREESTYLE 
RACE YOU PICK OUT A COUPLE OF THEM 
AND SAY THEY HAVE A SPRINT FINISH 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO DO THIS IN THIS 
RACE BECAUSE YOU HAVE KATE 
ADLINGTON WHO CAN RANGE JACKSON WAS QUICK ON THE FIRST LEG 
OF THE RELAY SO IT IS STARTING TO 
ONE RAVEL AND IT IS INTERESTING A 
LITTLE BIT OF CAT AND MOUSE FOR 
THIRD FOURTH FIFTH AND SIX REBECCA 
ADLINGTON HAS MADE STATEMENT 
DURING THIS FIRST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY METRES SHE 
DOES LOOK GOOD SHE LOOKS VERY 
STRONG 
IF SHE GETS ANOTHER BODY STRONG LENGTH BETWEEN HER AND THE REST OF 
THE FIELD I THINK THAT'LL BE 
ENOUGH JO JACKSON IS NOT OUT OF THIS FOR 
THE MEDALS A FEW SWIMMERS WILL BE 
PACING EACH OTHER OFF EACH OTHER 
THEY WILL SEE KATE ADLINGTON'S F. T. 
IN THE DISTANCE AT EACH TURN IT IS 
VERY DIFFICULT TO BRIDGE THE GAP 
IT CERTAINLY IS ANTI EUROPEAN 
RECORD IS SET BY IT LAURA MANNER DO 
SHE NORMALLY GOES OUT AND THEN 
WEARS HERSELF OUT THE EUROPEAN 
RECORD IS VERY MUCH ON THIS IS NOT 
FAR OFF THE WORLD RECORD PACE KATE 
ADLINGTON IS REACTING TO THE CROWD 
SHE LOOKS GOOD 
THE QUESTION OF 
WHETHER SHE HAD ENOUGH IN HER TANK 
HAS BEEN ANSWERED HERE 
SHE STILL 
HAS QUITE A WAY TO GO ADRIAN SHE SHE HAS COME A BAR BUT IT WITH THE 
DISTANCE SWIMMERS THEY SET OFF AND 
KEEP THE PACE SHE IS FIVE METRES AHEAD OF THE 
FIELD AT THE MOMENT SHE IS JUST 
UNDER THE WORLD RECORD SPLIT YOU JUST WANT THE CROWD TO GET ON 
HER FEET NOW AND RECOGNISE WHAT IS 
GOING ON SOMEBODY SHOULD TELL THEM 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A WORLD RECORD THE TIME IS GETTING 
GREATER AND GREATER UNDER THE WORLD SPLIT KATE 
ADLINGTON IS GOING GREAT SHE DOES 
NOT LOOK AS THOUGH SHE IS 
STRUGGLING THE LAST PERSON WE SAW SET A WORLD 
RECORD WAS SARAH HARDCASTLE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
KATE ADLINGTON BROKE THAT LAST WEEK THIS WILL BE A PHENOMENAL TWO WEEKS 
FOR THIS WOMAN IF SHE CAN DO THIS 
HER COACH HAS DONE VERY VERY WELL 
HE HAS LOOKED AFTER HER SO WELL 
ONLY COUPLE TO GO NOW THE REST 
OF THE FIELD IS STILL SORT OF WITH 
HER AS WELL THIS IS ALL ABOUT NINETEEN REBECCA 
ADLINGTON NINETEEN YEAR OLD REBECCA 
ADLINGTON FROM NOTTINGHAM SHE IS 
STILL UNDER THE WORLD RECORD PACE 
IT IS TIGHT SHE ASKED TO COME BACK 
IN SIXTY SECONDS THAT IS HUGE THERE IS THE RED LINE OF THE WORLD RECORD I THINK SHE IS GOING TO DO IT COME 
ON REBECCA ADLINGTON WON THE 
FOUR HUNDRED SHE WON THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND I THINK 
SHE IS GOING TO GET THE WORLD 
RECORD HERE THE CROWD IS NOW ON 
THEIR FEET SHE WAS JUST A QUARTER OF A SECOND 
OUTSIDE WHAT GREAT SWIM SHE IS 
ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED HOW DEEP DID 
SHE DISH 
THAT WAS TOUGH THAT WAS 
REALLY HARD NOT QUITE ENOUGH IN 
THE TANK THE AUSTRALIAN SWAM VERY 
WELL JOANNE JACKSON HAS COME IN SIXTH 
PLACE THE OLD BRITISH RECORD OF 
EIGHT POINT OH FIVE HAS JUST GONE JUST MISSING 
THE WORLD RECORD THAT WAS GOING TO 
GIVE HER SUCH BEAST FOR THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES 
THE TWELVE SECONDS 
LIFETIME BEST SHE MUST BE ON TOP 
OF THE WORLD SHE IS THE WORLD 
CHAMPION WORLD CHAMPION AT THE 
WOMEN'S EIGHT HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE GOODNESS ME 
SHE ATTACKED IT AS WELL LAURE 
MANADOU DECIDED NOT TO COME 
FOCUSING ON THE FRENCH TRIALS OH 
MY GOD HAS JUST GONE A EUROPEAN 
RECORD DESTROYED HOME RECORD HAS 
JUST GONE 
THAT DIED WAS PERFECT 
DIVE YOU LEARN FROM PEOPLE LIKE 
IAN THORPE EVERY MINUTE DETAIL 
DONE VERY WELL AND SOME OF THE 
TURNS SHE WAS REALLY WHIPPING THEM 
LOOK AT THAT 
THAT LAST TURN I 
WATCH THAT THINKING THAT SHE LOOKED 
REALLY TIRED THEY MUST BE NO 
ENERGY LEFT 
A TWELVE SECOND LIFETIME 
BEST YOU DO NOT NORMALLY DO THAT 
IN A FINAL 
YOU CAN TAKE CHUNKS OF 
DISTANCE EVENTS BUT WHEN IT IS 
SPRINT EVENT IT IS HARD TO BRING IT 
DOWN BY A FEW SECONDS BUT IN THESE 
EVENTS YOU CAN REBECCA IS HAVING A 
GOOD YEAR AND IT TRAINING PROGRAMME 
IS OBVIOUSLY WORKING AND AS A 
BRITISH RECORD A NEW EUROPEAN 
RECORD A COMMONWEALTH RECORD A 
STUNNING SWIM EIGHT MINUTES EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
UNBELIEVABLE SWIMMING SHE WON THE 
TRIALS SURPRISINGLY OLYMPIC 
TRIALS WHAT CAN SHE DO IN FOUR 
MONTHS 
THERE ARE A FEW MORE TO MONTHS TURN UP BUT SHE WILL BE IN THE 
HUNT FOR RECORDS IT WOULD BE GREAT 
TO SEE GOLD MEDALS AT THE OLYMPICS 
OBVIOUSLY OUR SECOND GOLD RECORD TONIGHT JOANNE JACKSON WAS SIXTH REBECCA ADLINGTON STEPPING FORWARD 
TO RECEIVE A GOLD MEDAL SHE SAYS 
HER BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER 
CAREER WAS NOT MAKING THE 
COMMONWEALTH GAMES SQUAD FOR TWO THOUSAND SIX 
BUT SHE HAS MADE UP FOR THAT HER 
ULTIMATE AMBITION IS THE GOLD MEDAL 
AT THE OLYMPICS SHE HAS GOT A GOLD 
MEDAL AT THE WORLD SHORT COURSE 
SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS SHE WILL 
HAVE THREE INDIVIDUAL EVENTS AND A 
RELAY AT THE OLYMPICS SO SHE WILL 
BE BUSY 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
CHAT TO HER AND FIND OUT WHAT SHE 
PLANS TO DO BECAUSE IT IS A REALLY 
BUSY PROGRAMME AND IT IS NOT 
NECESSARILY IN THE RIGHT ORDER FOR 
HER IT WOULD BE PERFECT TO START 
WITH THE MAIN EVENT AND WORK DOWN 
BUT IT DOES NOT COME THAT WAY IN 
THE PROGRAMME 
SHE WILL BE JOINING 
US BEFORE THE END OF THE PROGRAMME 
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR THE WORLD 
SHORT COURSE CHAMPION WILL BE 
SITTING THERE 
THE GOOD THING IS 
THAT SHE IS DOING DISTANCE EVENTS 
AND THEY DO NOT HAVE SEMI FINALS 
HEATS AND FINALS SHE DOES NOT HAVE 
TO DO THREE RACES LIKE MICHAEL 
PHELPS ON THE TWO HUNDRED BUTTERFLY WILL 
HAVE TO DO SHE JUST HAS HEATS AND 
FINALS IT ENDED METRES IS STILL A 
LONG WAY GROUSE EIGHT HUNDRED 
SHE ONLY DID IT ONCE HERE HOW WAS SHE CHANGED HER TRAINING 
FOR THE OLYMPICS 
CAN DO YOU 
CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK THINKING 
FASTER 
I DO NOT THINK SHE WILL FASTER CHANGE IT 
WHAT SHE WILL DO IS MOVE 
INTO A LONG COURSE POOL IF YOU CAN 
IT IS VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU 
CANNOT SEE THE END AFTER YOU PUT 
OFF PLAYED FIVE METRES YOU CAN SEE 
THE END AND TO BOUNCE OFF THE WALLS 
TWENTY FIVE METRES SOME PEOPLE DO NOT 
LIKE IT BUT SHE IS SO STRONG 
MENTALLY SHE IS SO COMFORTABLE AND 
STRONG 
SO TOGETHER SHE SEEMS TO STRONG BE A LOT OLDER THAN NINETEEN 
SHE IS 
HAPPY AND JOLLY AS WELL SHE WILL 
PROBABLY TELL YOU THAT SHE PREFERS 
THE LONG COURSE 
WE WILL ASK HER 
LATER QUESTION NUMBER ONE WE WILL 
LOOK AT THE MEN'S RELAY NOW

SWIM FROM HIM NICHOLAS SPRENGER HAS GREAT 
EXPERIENCE HE WAS IN THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR

DUTCH HAD COME UP BUT NOW WE HAVE 
AUSTRALIA OUT IN FRONT AND GREAT 
BRITAIN CLEARLY IN SECOND PLACE 
WITH THE REST SCRAPPING FOR THE 
BRONZE THIS IS OMINOUS FOR 
AUSTRALIA THEIR FINAL SWIMMER 
KENRICK MONK WON THE INDIVIDUAL 
DO OH EIGHT SECONDS FASTER THAN GREAT 
BRITAIN'S FASTEST TWENTY EIGHT HE LOOKS 
VERY STRONG INDEED AUSTRALIA'S 
NICHOLAS SPRENGER HAS TWO LENGTHS

LEG THIS IS A SUPER SWIM FOR GREAT 
BRITAIN ANDREW HUNTER IS WELL OUT

ROSS DAVENPORT COMING ANDREW HUNTER IS GETTING CLOSE BUT 
WHEN THE AUSTRALIANS THAT THE WORLD 
RECORD LAST YEAR KENRICK MONK HAD 
FANTASTIC LAST CLASS DAVENPORT 
HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT HERE IT WOULD 
BE GREAT TO SEE HIM GET CLOSE BUT 
KENRICK MONK WILL HAVE SOMETHING 
HERE 
HE HAS GONE OFF LIKE A SHOT HERE THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE ROSS 
DAVENPORT LOVE THIS SITUATION BUT 
AT HIM GO HE IS TRACKING DOWN THE 
AUSTRALIAN KENRICK MONK WATCH 
HIM GO A VERY IMPRESSIVE SWIM FOR 
THE BRITISH THEY HAVE REST THE 
LEFT OF THE FIELD FOR DEAD AMERICA 
JUST ABOUT IN BRONZE MEDAL WITH 
ITALY IN FOURTH THEY WILL SCRAP IT 
OUT FOR BRONZE BUT AUSTRALIA ARE 
IN GOLD COMING BACK IS ROSS 
IN GOLD COMING BACK IS ROSS DAVENPORT HE IS GOING FOR IT THIS THIS WILL BE THE SWIM OF A LIFETIME 
WITH THE FORMAT KENRICK MONK HAS 
GOT THIS WILL BE TREMENDOUS THE 
CROWD JUST ABOUT TO GET NOISY THE GOLD MEDAL IS UP FOR GRABS 
KENRICK MONK IS VERY QUICK INDEED 
BUT THE CROWD HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN 
ROSS DAVENPORT HE STILL HAS TWO LEGS TO GO 
KENRICK MONK OF AUSTRALIA AT THE 
TOP OF THE PICTURE ROSS DAVENPORT 
SWAM A BLINDING SIX LENGTHS TWO TO 
GO THE CROWD GETTING INTO IT CAN 
ROSS DAVENPORT HOLD ON KENRICK 
MONK IS STARTING TO MOVE HE REALLY 
IS BIG AND POWERFUL BUT HE DOES NOT 
SEEM TO BE GETTING AWAY TO BATH IS 
THIS THE FINAL TEN GETTING AWAY 
TOO FAR WHAT A BRILLIANT BRILLIANT SWIM 
FOR A GREAT BRITAIN TEAM AND AS A 
BRITISH RECORD FOR THEM A SUPER 
SWIM SIX MINUTES FIFTY SIX SUPER 
BRITISH RECORD A BRILLIANT SILVER MEDAL AT THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS DID NOT CATCH 
THE AUSTRALIANS BUT MUCH CLOSER 
THAN I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE HE HE KNOWS HE HAS BEEN IN A BATTLE THERE 
DAVENPORT GAVE IT EVERYTHING HE 
COULD NOT QUITE GET THEM KENRICK 
MONK AT THE LAST FIFTEEN OR TWENTY METRES 
INTERESTING HE WAS BREATHING 
TOWARDS THE BRIT ROSS DAVENPORT 
WAS LOOKING THE SAME WAY NOT THE 
RIGHT WAY TO SEE THE AUSTRALIANS THE AUSTRALIANS TRYING TO TRACE 
DOWN THEIR WORLD RECORD AND THEY 
WERE A FEW SECONDS OF THAT BUT 
BRITAIN HAVE SMASHED THE EUROPEAN 
RECORD IT WAS HELD BY ITALY AT SIX 
MINUTES FIFTY NINE AND BRITAIN HAVE JUST 
GONE SIX MINUTES FIFTY SIX A REAL TEAM 
EFFORT NO REAL SUPERSTARS BUT ALL 
OF THEM EXTREMELY SOLID INDEED 
THEY NEED TO WORK OUT THEIR SPIRITS 
BUT FANTASTIC SWIMMING SPLITS THE ATTACK ON THAT LAST ONE HE 
SHOULD NOT REALLY HAVE DONE THAT 
HE HAD THE INDIVIDUAL GOLD 
MEDALLIST KENRICK MONK OF 
AUSTRALIA LINED UP AT THE START 
BEAUTIFUL ENTRY HE WAS NOT GREAT IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE I 
THINK HE WAS TIRED IT IS NOT EASY 
TO DO WHAT HE HAD LEFT IN HIS TANK 
WAS A BIT MORE THAN DAVENPORT AND 
FORTUNATELY FOR US BUT A WONDERFUL 
SILVER MEDAL FOR GREAT BRITAIN 
UNFORTUNATELY A EUROPEAN RECORD BY TWENTY FIVE SECONDS 
THE BRITS MUST BE VERY PROUD OF 
THEMSELVES ROBERT RENWICK DAVID 
CARRY ANDREW HUNTER AND ROSS 
DAVENPORT BETWEEN THEM GETTING 
GOLD AND SILVER THAT THE 
COMMONWEALTH GAMES THREE'S GOT HIS 
MEN IN THAT FINAL THREE SCOTTISH 
MEN ANY EUROPEAN RECORD FOR GREAT 
BRITAIN TO GET THE SILVER NEW 
MANY CONGRATULATIONS A TREMENDOUS 
WIN A SEVEN SECONDS BRITISH RECORD

RECORD BY SCOTTISH MEN BUT NOT 
QUITE 
WE ALL JUST WENT FOR 
IT AND QUITE IT PAID OFF WITH ALMOST BEAT THEM 
A GREAT RACE A GOOD START AND A 
PERSONAL BEST 
VERY HAPPY WITH THAT 
A SCOTTISH RECORD SO I CANNOT 
COMPLAIN 
HE HAS TAKING YOUR RECORD COMPLAIN DAVID 
I WILL NOT BEGRUDGE HIM DAVID THAT A GREAT FIRST LEG L. TRIED TO 
HANG IN THERE AND I THINK I MANAGED 
TO GET A BIT AHEAD OF THEM SO I 
SET THEM UP FOR A GREAT RACE YOU YOU PASTED BEAUTIFULLY 
INITIALLY I WAS 
THINKING THAT I HAD TO GET AHEAD OF 
THEM BUT ROBBIE KEANE WAS AHEAD 
WHAT MAKES THIS REALLY SO SPECIAL 
IS THAT NOBODY HERE IS A SUPERSTAR 
YOU ARE ALL SUPERSTARS 
ROBERT DE A 
DEEP AND FOUND AN EXTRA SECOND 
TONIGHT AND DAVID GAVE US A GREAT 
START DUG DEEP L. CANNOT ASK FOR 
ANY MORE FROM A TEAM THAN THIS AND AND YOU REALLY WENT FOR THAT YOUR LEGS

FOR THAT THE COMMONWEALTH FOURTH AT 
THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES AND FINALLY 
WE HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 
WONDERFUL TO GO OUT AND GET A MEDAL

INCENTIVE TO GO OUT THERE AND DO IT 
AT BEIJING 
A N. D. BEAT THE 
AMERICANS YEAH 
YOU BEAT THE 
AMERICANS YEAH AMERICANS THE GREAT DAY FOR BRITISH SWIMMING THEY HAVE FINISHED FOURTH FAR TOO MANY 
TIMES AND NOW THEY GET A MEDAL A 
TERRIFIC PERFORMANCE FROM THE 
BRITISH MEN THE AMERICANS OUT IN 
FRONT TAKING THEIR FOURTH GOLD MEDAL 
OF THE GAME SO FAR AUSTRALIANS 
BEARING IN MIND THAT WE ARE HALFWAY 
THROUGH THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
TWO AND A HALF DAYS TO GO THE MOST 
GOLD MEDALS THAT BRITAIN HAVE EVER 
WON IS THREE IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WE HAVE TWO 
ALREADY NOT A BAD START 
A GREAT 
START WITH SOME GOOD RACES TO GO 
SOME FANTASTIC RELAYS ESPECIALLY 
THE FOUR TIMES ONE HUNDRED M. MEDLEY RELAY 
THAT IS EXCITING WHEN THEY SWIM 
REALLY WELL IT IS QUITE CONTAGIOUS 
AND IF YOU START OFF BADLY THAT CAN 
BE CONTAGIOUS AS WELL IT IS REALLY 
IMPORTANT AT THE START OF THE 
COMPETITION IS RIGHT 
YOU MADE THE 
POINT THAT FOUR OF THOSE GUYS ARE 
LEVEL IN TURNS OF TIMES HOW 
IMPORTANT IS THAT FOR THE OLYMPICS 
RELAYS ARE TOUGH OTHER CONTENDERS 
THEY HAVE A CHANCE THEY ALL HAVE 
TO GO WITH THAT THE OLYMPICS ARE 
DIFFERENT THINK A WHOLE OTHER 
KETTLE OF FISH IT IS A CAULDRON 
AND IT REALLY BUBBLES ALL SORTS 
CAN HAPPEN AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
THEY WILL BE TURNING TO MARK FOSTER 
FOR ADVICE FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
HE HAS QUALIFIED FOR HIS FIFTH 
OLYMPICS AND HE WILL BE THIRTY EIGHT WHEN 
THAT COMES ALONG HE HAS THE ENERGY 
OF SOMEONE YOUNGER AND IN THE 
FREESTYLE HE WAS IN NO FOUR LANE 
FOUR FIVE GOT A BAD START BUT MARK 
FOSTER GOT A GOOD ONE FIRST UP 
INTO HIS STROKE THAT HIGH ARM 
STROKE ROLLING ON THE FIFTY M. 
FREESTYLE HIS TURN WAS QUICK ALSO 
GOING WELL IS MATT TUTTY VERY COMFORTABLE FOR MARK FOSTER 
THAT IS A GREAT SWIM TWENTY ONE THEY DID 
DO IS GOOD BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT 
MAP THIRTY GOT LIFETIME BEST MATT TUTTY THE REST OF THEM WERE PLAYING 
CATCH UP HIS REACTION TIME WAS NOT 
GREAT NOT OH ONE SECONDS DOWN ON THE 
REST OF THE FIELD MAYBE BECAUSE HE 
IS OLDER BUT THE REST WAS TO 
PERFECTION SURFING ON TOP OF THE 
WATER VERY HIGH AND THAT IS NOT 
EASY TO DO YOU HAVE TO GET ON TOP 
OF THE WATER A GREAT TURN AND 
STRAIGHT INTO HIS STROKE HE DOES 
NOT HANG AROUND WE TOOK A LOT 
ABOUT BEING UNDER WATER GLIDING 
STREAMLINED TO GAIN SPEED BUT 
MARK FOSTER DOES NOT HANG AROUND 
THIS WAS HIS RACE HE WON THE FIRST SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPIONSHIP FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
HE IS 
GETTING GREATER OVATION FROM THE 
CROWD HE IS IN GREAT SHAPE YOU 
WILL SEE HIS FACE ON THE BACK OF A 
BUS HE HAS AN ADVERT 
HE HAS HE 
HAS SHAVED HIS CHIN NICE TO SEE 
GREAT SWIM FROM FOSTER THE GREAT 
SWING FROM MATTHEW HE COULD ALSO 
MAKE THE FINAL 
THAT WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD I 
SHUT DOWN IN THE LAST TEN M. IT DID 
NOT WANT TO BE IN THE MIDDLE L. SAW 
WHAT HAPPENED TO LIAM L. KNOW FROM 
PAST EXPERIENCE BEEN ON THE 
OUTSIDE LANE IS BETTER L. DID NOT 
NOTICE THE WAVES AND IF YOU GET 
OUT AHEAD YOU DON'T HIT THE WAVES 
FOUR YEARS AGO EXACTLY YOU WERE IN 
A DIFFERENT PLACE WHENCE YOU 
THINGS WERE DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE 
NOW 
FROM MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE NOW I AM A LOT HAPPIER WITH SWIMMING IN 
GENERAL IT IS LOVELY TO BE BACK 
THE ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN BRILLIANT 
I HAVE BEEN WELCOMED BACK INTO SUCH 
A POSITIVE ATMOSPHERE 
WELL DONE 
MARK FOSTER MAKING A PREDICTION HE 
WOULD QUALIFY FASTEST HE DID HE 
WILL BE IN LANE FOUR HIS FINAL 
TONIGHT IS AT EIGHT FIFTY P. M. AND IT IS LIVE 
ON B. B. C. INTERACTIVE 
TONIGHT IS AT EIGHT FIFTY P. M. AND IT IS LIVE ON B. B. C. INTERACTIVE 
THAT IS A VERY 
STRONG LINE UP RYAN LOCHTE IS IN 
THERE A WAY IT AS WELL WHAT 
BRIAN AND QUIST BE A DANGER FROM 
THE U. S. A. 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN MARKS OF 
CONFIDENCE AS HE IS AT THE MOMENT 
HE IS ENJOYING BEING BACK IN THE 
WATER AGAIN L. DON'T SUPPOSE HE 
FEELS HE HAS ANYTHING TO LOSE HE 
HAS A VERY VARIED LIKE SO ALTHOUGH 
SWIMMING IS NINETY PER CENT OF HIS LIFE THERE 
ARE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS GOING ON 
A BIT OF MODELLING HE HAS HIS 
OWN COMPANY GOING 
HE IS A GREAT 
LOOKING BLOKE HE IS CHISELLED SIX 
F. T. SIX AND HIS FACE IS ON THE BACK OF 
A BUS 
WHEN YOU SAID IN COMMENTARY 
LOOK AT HIS FACE NOBODY WAS 
LOOKING AT HIS FACE THEY WERE 
LOOKING AT HIS BODY HIS CHEST HIS 
ATHLETIC APPRECIATION HE HAS 
WITHDRAWN FROM THE BUTTERFLY TO 
CONCENTRATE ON THE FREESTYLE I'M I'M NOT SURPRISED 
IT IS THE RIGHT 
THING TO DO HE WAS EXHAUSTED AFTER 
TWO 
HE DID THE HEATS OF THE FLIGHT TWO THIS MORNING BUT THEN PULLED OUT OF 
THE SEMIS TONIGHT WILL BE LOOKING 
BACK AT THIS MORNING'S HEATS JUST 
AFTER THIS 
A SIMPLE RECIPE TAKE ONE ANGLO 
BACK TO THE SWIMMING AND WE HAVE 
SEEN LIAM TANCOCK WON THE ONE HUNDRED M. 
BACKSTROKE HALF THE DISTANCE AND 
HIS FAVOURED DISTANCE THIS MORNING 
HE WAS IN THE HEAT OF THE FIFTY M. BACK LIAM TANCOCK HAS SEEN TWO GUYS IN 
EARLY HEATS GO SUPER QUICK DO YOU 
THINK WE WILL SEE A BRITISH RECORD 
HERE HE IS A WORLD RECORD HOLDER 
HE HAS GOT TO HAVE MASSIVE 
CONFIDENCE 
LIAM TANCOCK AT THE TOP CONFIDENCE WILL GREAT BRITAIN HE IS ALLOWED 
FIFTEEN UNDER WATER AND HE DID PERFECTLY 
IT IS A GOOD START IT IS ONLY TWO 
THE BRITISH RECORD IS HIS OWN TWENTY THREE SIXTY FOUR THE FASTEST SO FAR HE HAS 
SET A WORLD RECORD LONG COURSE 
THAT IS VERY QUICK AND A BIG 
BRITISH RECORD TO START WITH THE THE WORLD RECORD IS EXTREMELY FAST 
LIAM TANCOCK DOING ENOUGH I THINK 
YOU ARE RIGHT HE DID ENOUGH HE 
WORKED HARD OBVIOUSLY HAVING A 
SUCCESS LIKE HE DID LAST NIGHT 
SETTLING DOWN GETTING SOME SLEEP 
AND GETTING SOME FOOD 
HE LOOKED 
QUITE CONTROLLED 
LONG COURSE WORLD RECORD HOLDER 
AGAINST THE SHORT COURSE WORLD 
RECORD HOLDER SO HOW HAVE YOU 
CONCENTRATED 
IT WAS A BIG NIGHT CONCENTRATED WINNING THE GOLD MEDAL L. ATE SOME 
GOOD STUFF HAD A NICE LEAD AND 
THEN JUST DID A JOB THIS MORNING 
YOU HAVE BUSY TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL 
MEDLEY COMING UP 
YES GET IN THE 
SWIM DOWN HAVE LITTLE MASSAGE 
CHANGE MY SUIT AND GET BACK IN I I SAW YOU WAVING AT THE CROWD ARE 
YOU A SUPERSTAR 
MAYBE ONE DAY 
WHY WOULD HE CHANGE HIS SUIT 
SHARON SAID HE WOULDN'T WANT TO SIT 
IN A WET ONE 
A BIT LIKE A WET 
NAPPY 
TWO HUNDRED M. INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY AND NAPPY HE WAS UP AGAINST JAMES GODDARD 
THE MAN WHO BEAT HIM IN THE TRIALS 
LAST WEEK GODDARD IS THE COMMONWEALTH CHAMPION TWO HUNDRED M. BREASTSTROKE LIAM TANCOCK COULD START HE IS 
REALLY FLYING DOWN THIS FIRST FIFTY 
GODDARD IS GOING WITH THEM RYAN 
LOCHTE IS A VERY GOOD BREASTSTROKE 
AND BACKSTROKE 
LIAM TANCOCK'S 
TURNS ARE FANTASTIC GODDARD BOTH 
THESE GUYS ARE GREAT AT BACKSTROKE 
THIS IS A BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO 
BRITS GODDARD'S BACKSTROKE HE IS CATCHING UP THE RECORD IS HELD BY GREAT BRITAIN'S JAMES HICKMAN TIME CAR COULD HAVE USED MORE OF A FLY KICK LIAM TANCOCK THE BREASTSTROKE IS GOOD IT IS NOT 
EXCEPTIONAL BUT THEY ARE KEEPING 
THEIR POSITIONS 
GODDARD CAME FIRST 
IN THE OLYMPIC TRIALS THE BRITISH 
RECORD WAS ABSOLUTELY SMASHED IT 
LOOKS LIKE GODDARD'S FREESTYLE IS 
STARTING TO CATCH HIM UP TWENTY FIVE METRES 
TO GO THERE IS NO SEMI FINAL HERE 
SO THEY HAVE TO GO QUICK ANOTHER BRITISH RECORD I THINK 
THAT IS FIVE THIS MORNING WHAT A 
GREAT SWING FROM JAMES GODDARD 
LIAM TANCOCK'S WAS ALSO I'M SURE 
THEY WILL GET IN THE FINAL BOTH BOTH BRITISH GUYS WINNING EXCEPTIONALLY 
FAST JAMES HICKMAN'S RECORD GOES 
HE IS PART OF THE ORGANISING GROUP 
THAT WAS A GREAT TUSSLE BUT YOU 
HAVE TO WAIT A FEW DAYS BEFORE YOU 
GOT IN THE WATER 
I HAVE HAD TO 
WATCH EVERYBODY SWIM GREAT SO FAR 
IT IS GOING TO BE AN INSPIRATION 
HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE IN THE MEDALS 
AGAIN 
AN AMAZING RACE JUST AGAIN BETWEEN THE PAIR OF YOU 
WE DID IT 
LAST WEEK AT THE OLYMPIC TRIALS 
AND HE TOUCHED ME OUT THERE AGAIN 
IT IS THE HEATS AND HOPEFULLY WE 
HAVE MADE IT THROUGH TO THE FINALS 
TONIGHT 
I THINK YOU PROBABLY WILL TONIGHT DO RYAN IS SWIMMING AT THE MOMENT 
ANOTHER GOOD BACKSTROKE IS THAT 
THE SECRET 
YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD AT 
EVERYTHING LOCHTE HAS FANTASTIC 
FOUR STROKES YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT 
ALL ALL BOTH OF THEM INTO THE FINAL TONIGHT 
THEY WILL BE DIVIDED BY RYAN LOCHTE 
NINE FIFTEEN P. M. TONIGHT ON INTERACTIVE CAN 
WE GET TWO MEDALS TONIGHT 
I THINK 
THEY WILL ALL GO IN QUITE 
COMFORTABLY I THINK LOCHTE WAS 
AND THE TWO BRITS WERE 
WHEN I 
CHATTED TO RYAN AFTERWARDS HE SAID 
IT WAS FASTER THAN HE THOUGHT IT 
WAS GOING TO BE HE KNOWS HE HAS 
GOT A RACE ON TONIGHT 
HE CANNOT BE 
IN CRUISE CONTROL LIKE HE WAS I I THINK THEY WERE BOTH FAIRLY 
COMFORTABLE I DON'T THINK HE CAN 
CREWS AND WIN L. DON'T THINK 
BRITAIN HAS WON TWO MEDALS AT THE 
SHORT COURSE IN ONE RACE 
I KNOW 
LIAM WANTS TO PROVE A POINT THE 
LAST TWO TIMES THEY HAVE SWAM 
AGAINST EACH OTHER JAMES HAS ONE 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS HAS QUALIFIED 
FOR THE OLYMPICS AND THIS MORNING 
SHE WAS IN HEAT ACTION IN THE TWO HUNDRED ELIZABETH SIMMONDS IN LANE FOUR 
SHE WAS THE COST US FASTEST 
QUALIFIER NAME FIVE IS SCRATCH THERE IS NO SEMI FINALS AT THESE 
WORLD SHORT COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
THEY HAVE TO MOTOR IN THESE SEATS 
TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THROUGH TO 
THE FINAL THEY HAVE BEEN SOME VERY 
QUICK HEATS SO FAR KIRSTY COVENTRY 
NEARLY BROKE THE WORLD RECORD IN 
THE HEAT ELIZABETH SIMMONDS IS 
GOING OUT FOR IT

BACKSTROKE ELIZABETH SIMMONDS HAS 
ABOUT TEN M. TO GO CAN SHE GET THE 
BRITISH RECORD YET SHE HAS THAT WILL PUT HER SECOND FASTEST 
INTO THE FINAL RIGHT NEXT TO THE 
GREAT KIRSTY COVENTRY THAT WILL BE 
A SUPER BATTLE TONIGHT WHAT A 
GREAT SLIM 
PER THAT TECHNIQUE 
SWIM PERFECT TECHNIQUE NO REAL CHALLENGE IN THE HEATS WE 
THOUGHT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE 
OF A CHALLENGE BUT SHE PUTS HERSELF 
IN MEDAL CONTENTION FOR THIS 
EVENING KIRSTY COVENTRY WILL BE 
DIFFICULT TO BEAT BUT HANNAH MILEY 
HAD A GO SO ELIZABETH SIMMONDS CAN 
TOO NEW BRITISH RECORD SHE WILL 
QUALIFY FOR THE FINAL 
WHEN WE 
CHATTERED LAST NIGHT YOU WERE 
TALKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTING SOME 
CHANGES ON YOUR STARTS AND TURNS 
THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD TECHNICAL 
RACE 
I ENJOYED IT A LOT MORE L. RACE ENJOY IT MORE EVEN THOUGH IT IS 
DOUBLE THE PAIN BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
MORE CHANCE TO GET INTO THE RACE 
AND CONTROL IT MORE WHAT I DID 
THIS MORNING MY RACE PLAN WAS TO 
BUILD ON IT THROUGHOUT THE RACE

AM JUST CHUFFED 
THAT RECORD HAS 
BEEN THERE FOR SEVEN YEARS WE WE REALLY IT IS RIDICULOUS HOW EASY 
THAT SIXTY BUY MACRO IS COMPARED TO 
YESTERDAY ONLY TWO SECOND SLOWER

YOU GOING 
TO HAVE A GO AT KIRSTY COVENTRY 
TONIGHT 
DEFINITELY ANYTHING CAN TONIGHT HAPPEN IN THE FINAL AS WE SAW LAST 
NIGHT GIVE IT A GO GOOD LUCK THERE ARE FIVE NEW BRITISH RECORD 
SET THIS MORNING INCLUDING THIS ONE 
VERY GOOD ONE HUNDRED M. BREASTSTROKE THE 
TWO BRITISH GIRLS HAD TO RACE HERE 
VERY FAST KATE LOOKS VERY GOOD 
INDEED INSIDE THIS LAST TWENTY FIVE SHE 
BEAT THE BRITISH RECORD BY HALF THE 
SECOND THAT WAS THE FIFTY M. BREASTSTROKE 
SWIMMING REALLY WELL FOUR MONTHS 
OUT OF THE OLYMPICS IS AS GREAT FOR 
BRITISH SWIMMING NOT JUST FOR THE 
INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR THE RELAYS THEY THEY ARE GOING SO WELL WE LOVE THE 
RELAYS THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THE 
POSITION SHE IS FULL OF CONFIDENCE 
AND IT SHOWED IN HER RACING ONE OF 
THE THINGS THAT KATE HAYWOOD WAS 
LACKING WAS CONFIDENCE 
TALKING OF 
TAKING CONFIDENCE FROM RELAYS INTO 
INDIVIDUAL EVENTS ROBERT RENWICK 
GOT A PERSONAL BEST IN THE RELAY 
TEAM AND HE WAS IN INDIVIDUAL 
ACTION IN THE HEATS TODAY 
MEN'S FOUR HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE HEAT FIVE 
ROBERT RENWICK SEEMS TO BE A 
LEADING NICHOLAS SPRENGER OF 
AUSTRALIA IS IN LANE FOUR THEY

SWIMMER WE EXPECT NICHOLAS 
SPRENGER AND ROBERT RENWICK TO 
BATTLE IT OUT VERY PLEASED FOR 
ROBERT RENWICK HE QUALIFIED FOR 
THE OLYMPIC TEAM ONLY TWO OF THEM 
GOING FOR THE INDIVIDUAL A REAL 
STEP UP FOR HIM THIS YEAR GOOD TO 
SEE 
THIS IS A TIME TRIAL AS WELL SEE THREE BIG HEATS THE LAST BIG ONES 
THERE IS NO SEMI FINAL IT IS QUITE 
SIMPLY THE FASTEST EIGHT SWIMMERS

IMAGINE THAT NOT ALL FOUR OF THESE 
WILL MAKE THE FINAL ROBERT RENWICK 
FROM THE CITY OF ABERDEEN HE SWAM 
A REALLY GREAT RELAY LEG IT LOOKS 
LIKE HE IS GOING WELL HERE HE HAS 
GOT TO GET MOVING FIFTY TO GO AT THIS 
TURN ROBERT RENWICK LEADING FOR 
GREAT BRITAIN NICHOLAS SPRENGER

HIM A BIT HE HAS TO GO TO HIS LEGS

A GOOD FIFTY M. REALLY MOTOR

PHRENIC DONE THREE MINUTES FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN 
ROBERT RENWICK A VERY GOOD SWIM

BRITISH RECORD IN TWO THOUSAND IN ATHENS

THE FINAL ROBERT RENWICK HAS DONE 
A FANTASTIC SWIM AND BROKEN A 
RECORD THAT HAS STOOD FOR EIGHT 
YEARS WE WILL SEE DAVID CARRY 
COMING UP IN A COUPLE OF HEATS AND 
HE WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT 
THAT I AM SURE AND DAVID CARRY ALSO MADE THE FINAL 
OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE WHICH IS ON 
JUST BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK WE MIGHT 
HAVE SWITCHED TO INTERACTIVE BY 
THEN YOU WILL SEE IT ON 
INTERACTIVE BUT ON B. B. C. TWO WE WILL

DO YOU ENJOY THE 
TRAINING SOME PEOPLE HATE IT AND 
SOME PEOPLE DO NOT MIND 
YOU DO IN 
A WAY IT IS NICE THE FEELING OF 
SWIMMING WELL WHEN YOU HAVE DONE A 
GOOD SET AND YOU HAVE SWUM WELL 
BUT IT IS SO HARD TO GET UP IN THE 
MORNING WHEN YOU WANT TO STAY IN 
BED NO IT IS GOOD 
AND THE REASON 
YOU DO IT MOMENTS LIKE THIS DOES 
THE ELATION OF THIS SWIM AND 
KNOWING THAT YOU WERE BANG ON FOR A 
WORLD RECORD HAD YOU NOT GLIDED 
I DO NOT KNOW THAT IS WHAT THEY 
SAID BUT HOW LONG DOES THAT 
ELATION LAST AND IS IT WORTH IT FOR 
THE PAIN OF TRAINING DEFINITELY DEFINITELY INJURY TRAINING ALL YOU THINK 
ABOUT HIS BACK TO PREVIOUS RACES 
THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND YOU REMEMBER 
THE FEELING AND GO BACK TO IT WHEN 
THE TRAINING GETS DIFFICULT YOU 
ASK YOURSELF WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

A WONDERFUL 
MOMENT IN FRONT OF THE HOME CROWD 
TO BE STANDING UP ON THE PODIUM AND 
SEEING FACES THAT YOU RECOGNISE IN 
THE CROWD WHAT ARE YOU THINKING 
THAT THIS POINT ARE YOU FEELING 
SELF CONSCIOUS

BLOCKS THEY TOLD ME TO GIVE AWAY 
TO MY PARENTS L. WAS SCARED DOING IT 
YOU WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT IT I AM NOT VERY CONFIDENT WHEN I GET 
ON THAT

HARDER THAN STANDING ON THE BLOCKS
