I'M IN THE HEART OF THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
THE COUNTY OF ROLLING HILLS WHITE HORSES AND ANCIENT STONES 
TODAY I'M IN WILTSHIRE AND THIS IS ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY 
COMING UP ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME 
I'M HELPING A LONDON COUPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY 
THIS IS A SURPRISE THIS IS STUNNING THIS IS LOVELY 
IT'S REALLY NICE IN HERE THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT THREE PROPERTIES THAT 
I'VE HAND PICKED TO MATCH THEIR NEEDS AS WELL AS MY MYSTERY HOUSE 
BUT CAN I FIND A HOUSE THAT MATCHES THEIR EXPECTATIONS 
MY INITIAL IMPRESSION OF THE HOUSE WAS VERY NEGATIVE 
I JUST THINK IT'S TOO COSY FOR US 
I AM GOING TO HAVE MY WORK CUT OUT 
WILTSHIRE PROVIDES A PERFECT SETTING FOR AN ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY 
IT BOASTS VAST AREAS OF OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY 
IF YOU COMBINE THE LANDSCAPE WITH THE GOOD TRANSPORT LINKS TO THE HOME COUNTIES AND LONDON IT'S NO WONDER 
THAT THIS PART OF THE WEST COUNTRY IS SO POPULAR 
THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A DETACHED PROPERTY IN WILTSHIRE 
IS AROUND THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND BANG ON LINE WITH THE NATIONAL AVERAGE 
SO I'M HOPING MY PROPERTY SEARCH WILL UNVEIL SOME BARGAINS FOR TODAY'S BUYERS 
CHRIS AND MARIE DONOGHUE CURRENTLY LIVE IN EAST DULWICH LONDON 
WITH THEIR DAUGHTER FREYA AND HAVE ANOTHER BUNDLE ON THE WAY 
CHRIS IS AN ARCHITECT IN THE CITY AND MARIE IS A SOCIAL WORKER 
BUT BOTH ARE READY TO MAKE THE MOVE TO MORE RURAL CLIMES 
TEN YEARS IN LONDON AND IT FEELS LIKE A LIFETIME NOW 
SO GETTING AWAY TO WILTSHIRE INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE MEANS THAT WE CAN GET OUTSIDE IN THE OUTDOORS 
A LOT MORE THAN WE'D HAVE DONE ORIGINALLY 
WE'D LOVE THE NEW HOUSE TO BE SPACIOUS TO HAVE FOUR BEDROOMS 
SOMEWHERE WE CAN PUT GUESTS UP WHEN THEY COME TO STAY 
WE'D LIKE A PLAY ROOM SOMEWHERE TO THROW ALL FREYA'S TOYS 
A BIG KITCHEN AN OPEN PLAN KITCHEN 
OPEN PLAN KITCHEN WE LIKE TO COOK THE GARDEN WE'D LIKE THAT TO BE NOT HUGE BUT BIG ENOUGH 
AND ALSO SAFE FOR THE CHILDREN SO WE CAN OPEN THE DOOR AND THEY CAN RUN AROUND AND HAVE A PLAY 
WITHOUT US WORRYING ABOUT THAT 
QUALIFIED IN REFLEXOLOGY ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO 
THE PLAN IS THAT I'D LIKE TO SET UP 
A PRACTICE WORKING POTENTIALLY FROM HOME 
IT WOULD BE A NICE WAY TO GET TO KNOW LOCAL PEOPLE 
AND IT WOULD BE GREAT TO COMBINE WITH FAMILY LIFE 
BUT DO MY BUYERS WANT TO GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY 
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GET AN OLDER PROPERTY A PERIOD PROPERTY 
WITH BEAMS AND STONE A CHARACTER PROPERTY 
AND THEN OVER THE YEARS WE CAN DO OUR OWN LITTLE FINISHING TOUCHES MAYBE A LITTLE EXTENSION 
MAKE IT MODERN BUT WITH A CHARACTER YEAH WITH A TWIST 
O. K. I'M ALREADY OFF THE MARK WITH THE HOUSE HUNT FOR CHRIS AND MARIE 
AND ONCE AGAIN I THINK I'VE GOT A CHALLENGE OF MY HANDS 
WE BOUGHT OUR HOUSE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO NOW 
WE PAID ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS A HELL OF A LOT AT THE TIME 
I ARRANGED FOR A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT TO VISIT THE DONOGHUES AND TO VALUE THEIR PROPERTY 
THE PROPERTY IS A FANTASTIC TWO BEDROOMED VICTORIAN TERRACE 
IT'S IN NUNHEAD JUST ON THE EAST DULWICH BORDERS 
WE'LL BE LOOKING AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE AS AN ASKING PRICE 
THAT IS A MASSIVE ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND PROFIT IN JUST FIVE YEARS 
SO THAT HAS REALLY HELPED US WITH OUR BUDGET FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE 
SO NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT BUYING A PROPERTY WHICH WOULD BE SORT OF FOUR HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY 
WHICH IS SOMETHING WE NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO FIVE YEARS AGO SO THIS IS SUPERB 
THAT'S GIVEN ME SOME GREAT POINTERS TOWARDS FINDING MARIE AND CHRIS 
EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR NEW HOME 
IN TERMS OF LOCATION I'M FOCUSING MY SEARCH IN THE WILTSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE 
SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE TOWNS OF MELKSHAM DEVIZES AND CHIPPENHAM 
SO I'VE STARTED MY PROPERTY SEARCH FOR CHRIS AND MARIE 
IT'S ALSO INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN WILTSHIRE 
WELL WITHIN CHRIS AND MARIE'S BUDGET IS THIS GRADE THE SECOND LISTED 
THATCHED COTTAGE IN ALDBOURNE ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THE PROPERTY HAS LOTS OF CHARACTER BUT ONLY TWO BEDROOMS WHICH IS TOO FEW FOR MY BUYERS 
THIS BARN CONVERSION IN WESTBURY IS PRICED AT JUST UNDER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IT'S FINISHED TO A HIGH STANDARD BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR A PLAY ROOM 
AND FOR MARIE'S REFLEXOLOGY PRACTICE 
SITUATED IN CHISELDON IS THIS THATCHED THREE BED COTTAGE AGAIN UNDER BUDGET AT THREE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND 
IT HAS MANY OF THE FEATURES CHRIS AND MARIE ARE AFTER 
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH IT'S IN THE WRONG LOCATION 
INSIDE WHEN YOU LOOK INSIDE AS WELL THAT LOOKS QUITE 
YEAH QUITE A NICE SPACE 
I'VE WHITTLED MY SEARCH DOWN TO THREE PROPERTIES THAT I'D LIKE THEM TO CHECK OVER BEFORE I BOOK IN VIEWINGS 
AND OUTBUILDINGS AS WELL THE OUTBUILDINGS I LIKE 
THEY'VE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THESE PROPERTIES COST AND HAVEN'T A CLUE 
WHAT LIES IN STORE FOR THEM WITH MY MYSTERY HOUSE NUMBER FOUR 
RIGHT ARE WE ALREADY FOR SOME HOUSE HUNTING ACTION 
VERY EXCITED YES YOU'VE FOUR TO SEE AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU PROPERTY NUMBER ONE OFF WE GO RIGHT 
HERE'S A QUICK REMINDER OF WHAT MARIE AND CHRIS ARE LOOKING FOR IN THEIR NEW HOME 
FOR THEIR BUDGET OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THEY'D LIKE A FOUR BED CHARACTER PROPERTY 
WITH A BIG KITCHEN ENOUGH RECEPTION ROOMS TO ALLOW FOR A PLAY ROOM 
A GARDEN THAT'S SAFE FOR THE CHILDREN 
AND IF CHRIS CAN MAKE HIS MARK ARCHITECTURALLY HE'LL BE DELIGHTED 
THE FIRST HOUSE I WANT TO SHOW THEM IS IN THE VILLAGE OF MARDEN 
SITUATED JUST FIVE MILES SOUTH EAST OF DEVIZES 
IT'S ONE OF ABOUT TWENTY PARISHES WHICH CLIMB THE NORTHERN ESCARPMENT OF SALISBURY PLAIN 
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF IT HAS ITS OWN GASTROPUB 
RIGHT COME INSIDE 
YOU BOTH SAID THAT YOU WANTED SOMETHING THAT HAD CHARACTER THAT HAD THE WOW FACTOR 
THIS IS GRADE THE SECOND LISTED DATES BACK TO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
I WANT TO LOOK INSIDE GOOD LET'S GO THEN 
CONVERTED FROM THREE ATTACHED COTTAGES MY FIRST HOUSE SHOULD PROVIDE MARIE AND CHRIS 
WITH THE KEY FEATURES THEY ARE AFTER 
AND AS AN ARCHITECT I HOPE CHRIS WILL LIKE THE FINISH LET'S HOPE WE GET OFF TO A GOOD START 
SO WALK INTO AN ENTRANCE HALL A BIT OF STORAGE THERE FOR YOU YEAH 
COME ROUND HERE AND HAVE A LOOK O. K. 
SO THIS IS YOUR LIVING ROOM 
IT LOOKS REAL CAN WE ACTUALLY DO A PROPER FIRE IN THERE 
WHAT ABOUT THE CEILING HEIGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT LOW CEILINGS 
I'M NEARLY SIX FOOT ODD IN MY HEELS YES IT IS QUITE LOW 
IN TERMS OF THE SIZE FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR WHAT ARE YOU THINKING 
SMALL SMALL I'D SAY THAT AS WELL 
IDEALLY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE SPACIOUS I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS AS THREE COTTAGES 
IF THIS IS ALREADY MADE INTO ONE BIG ONE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TINY WHEN IT WAS THREE 
O. K. LET ME SHOW YOU THROUGH HERE 
THIS IS QUITE INTERESTING ISN'T IT 
CUTE SO THIS IS THE FIRST OF THE THREE COTTAGES TO BE BUILT 
THIS WAS BUILT IN THE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTIES THIS IS THE DINING ROOM 
YES IT'S NICE I LIKE THE LITTLE WINDOWS AS WELL 
IT'S PART OF THE CHARM IN THESE KIND OF ROOMS 
AND THE LITTLE DOORS AND LATCHES AND EVERYTHING 
IT ALL HANGS TOGETHER QUITE NICELY 
O. K. SO DINING ROOM RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE KITCHEN 
O. K. COME THROUGH HERE 
RIGHT SWEET 
THIS IS A KATE MOSS INSPIRED KITCHEN 
IT'S VERY SKINNY 
YEAH YOU COULD DEFINITELY SAY THAT IT'S NARROW 
CURRENTLY YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE DINING ROOM SPACE AND PATIO DOORS THAT OPEN ON TO THE GARDEN 
WHICH WAY DOES IT FACE SOUTH FACING GREAT FOR SUNSHINE IN SUMMER YES 
THROUGH THE ENTRANCE HALL WHERE WE CAME IN VIA THERE'S A UTILITY CUPBOARD 
AND IN THERE IS THE WASHER AND DRIER 
THAT'S QUITE NICE TO HAVE 
GOOD TO HAVE IT SEPARATE BUT IT IS VERY SMALL 
AT THE MOMENT I'D HAVE TO GO SIDEWAYS THROUGH THIS KITCHEN 
CAN YOU GET THROUGH WITH YOUR BUMP 
I'M STRUGGLING I'M STAYING HERE 
RIGHT BEDROOMS 
YES YES GREAT LET'S GO UPSTAIRS UP WE GO 
I'M ALREADY ESTABLISHING THAT SPACE REALLY MATTERS FOR MARIE 
I DON'T THINK THE DOWNSTAIRS OF THIS PLACE HITS THE MARK 
CHRIS IS MORE POSITIVE THOUGH 
RIGHT MASTER BEDROOM 
O. K. PRETTY 
VERY PRETTY YEAH 
I KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS YOU ARE BOTH MOVING IS FOR MORE SPACE 
THIS ISN'T GIVING US ANY MORE SPACE THERE'S A REAL SHORTAGE OF STORAGE 
THAT'S A BIG BED THOUGH YOU'VE GOT A VERY DEEP STORAGE SPACE 
THERE'S A LOT OF STORAGE THERE BUT WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF STUFF 
BUT I DO LIKE ALL THESE EXPOSED TIMBERS IT HAS A REALLY NICE FEEL UP HERE 
ALTHOUGH CHRIS IS APPRECIATING THE AESTHETICS SPACE SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE FOR MARIE 
OH IT'S NICELY PRESENTED BUT AGAIN VERY SMALL 
IT'S THE SPACE THING AGAIN THERE'S A SMALL NURSERY NEXT DOOR AND THAT WON'T HELP MATTERS 
SO MAYBE TAKING A PEEK AT THE NEXT DOUBLE WILL TURN THE TIDE 
THIS IS THE THIRD BEDROOM 
RIGHT 
SLIGHTLY MORE SPACIOUS 
YEAH YOU'VE GOT A DOUBLE BED WHICH IS GOOD 
IT'S OOZING WITH CHARACTER THIS PLACE IT IS IT IS 
IT'S LIKE AN ADVENTURE GOING IN ALL THESE DOORWAYS 
AND THE VIEWS OUT OF THE WINDOWS ARE AMAZING 
YEAH I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE LIVING HERE THOUGH I THINK IT'S JUST TOO SMALL 
OFF WE GO 
SO CHRIS APPEARS OPEN MINDED WHILE MARIE HAS MADE HER MIND UP 
THE UPSTAIRS OF MY FIRST PROPERTY IS DIVIDED INTO TWO WINGS 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE NEXT FLIGHT OF STAIRS IS THIS SHOWER ROOM 
THEN UP TO THE FOURTH BEDROOM WHERE I CAN STILL USE MY FIRST PROPERTY 
AS A GAUGE OF WHAT THEY LIKE AND DISLIKE 
SIZE WISE IT'S NOT WORKING FOR YOU 
BUT IN TERMS OF DECOR STYLE JUST TO HELP ME IMMACULATE IT'S LOVELY 
IT IS REALLY NICE YOU CAN'T FAULT THE DECOR AT ALL IT'S REALLY GOOD 
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PUT YOUR TOUCHES ON IT YOU WOULDN'T CHANGE THE DECOR BECAUSE IT'S JUST LOVELY 
THEY LIKE THE DECORATION I SENSE THEY'D PREFER TO DO IT THEMSELVES 
SO EVEN WHEN I FIND A POSITIVE THERE'S A NEGATIVE 
MAYBE THE GARDEN WITH A VIEW WILL PRODUCE SOME SORT OF COMPLIMENT 
THIS IS THE MAJORITY OF THE GARDEN NICE REALLY ENCLOSED SAFE SPACE GORGEOUS 
LOOK HOW FAR YOU CAN SEE UP ON THE HILLS BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT QUIET AS WELL 
RIGHT O. K. HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THIS IS ON THE MARKET FOR 
WE'RE LOOKING THREE AND A HALF BEDROOMS BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY LOVELY LOCATION 
EXCELLENT CONDITION AS WELL I RECKON IT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE 
I DO FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
I WOULD SAY PROBABLY SOMETHING AROUND THAT MARK 
A LITTLE BIT MORE MAYBE POSSIBLY 
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT VERY BIG I'D SAY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
ON THE NOSE I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE DONE YOUR RESEARCH 
GOOD THIS IS ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WHICH IS UNDER YOUR BUDGET 
ON THAT BASIS DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND YEAH WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER LOOK 
ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK GO INSIDE I'LL SEE YOU SHORTLY 
FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MARIE AND CHRIS COULD BUY THIS GRADE THE SECOND LISTED THATCHED COTTAGE IN MARDEN 
IT HAS FOUR BEDROOMS 
A SOUTH FACING GARDEN AND IT'S BEEN DECORATED TO A HIGH STANDARD 
IT'S AMAZING IT'S GOT A WOW FACTOR WHEN YOU WALK IN THE GATE I WAS REALLY PLEASED WHEN WE WALKED IN 
INITIALLY THOUGH GOING INSIDE ALTHOUGH IT'S AMAZINGLY DECORATED AND FURNISHED 
THERE'S NOT A DROP OF PAINT ANYWHERE 
I JUST THINK IT'S TOO COSY FOR US 
WE LIKE TO HAVE FRIENDS OVER FOR DINNER AND WE'VE GOT QUITE A BIG KITCHEN AT THE MOMENT 
THIS PROPERTY HASN'T GOT THAT 
AND CHRIS HAS MENTIONED KNOCKING THE WALL DOWN AND MAKING A LARGE KITCHEN WHICH IS GREAT 
BUT I STILL DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GIVE US THE FAMILY SPACE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY AFTER 
HELLO ALL RIGHT 
YES FINE YES THANK YOU 
I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE SMALLEST OF THE FOUR I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR 
WE NEED TO GET BIGGER FROM HERE I THINK YEAH LET'S SEE THE OTHERS 
BRILLIANT 
WHILE I FINALISE MY NEXT PROPERTY I HAVE GIVEN CHRIS AND MARIE 
A LITTLE TIME ON THEIR OWN TO EXPLORE THE AREA 
HUGE OPEN SPACE COMPARED TO WHERE WE LIVE NOW YEAH I KNOW 
YOU CAN SEE FOR MILES 
DESCRIBED AS BRITAIN'S OLDEST ROAD THE RIDGEWAY IS AN EIGHTY FIVE MILE ROUTE 
THAT FOLLOWS THE CHALK HILLS FROM OVERTON HILL NEAR AVEBURY TO THE OXFORDSHIRE BORDERS 
BUT THAT'S ENOUGH HORSING AROUND AS WE'VE STILL GOT 
A TOTAL OF THREE HOUSES TO SEE INCLUDING MY MYSTERY PROPERTY 
THE SECOND HOUSE I HAVE FOUND MARIE AND CHRIS IS SITUATED WITHIN 
THE HEART OF BRADENSTOKE VILLAGE WHICH HAS A LOCAL SHOP AND PUB 
CHIPPENHAM IS ONLY FIVE MILES TO THE SOUTH WEST WITH A WIDER CHOICE OF SHOPS AND MAIN LINE RAIL CONNECTIONS 
RIGHT HOUSE NUMBER TWO 
IT'S BIGGER THAN THE LAST ONE VERY DECEIVING 
IT IS DECEIVING IT LOOKS QUITE TINY FROM THE OUTSIDE THIS IS A PROJECT 
I THINK IT REQUIRES A BIT OF T. L. C. 
O. K. SOME RESTYLING BY YOU BOTH 
WE COULD DO THAT 
PERFECT YEAH THAT'S REALLY GOOD 
HAPPY DAYS YEAH LET'S CHECK OUT INSIDE OFF YOU GO 
I HOPE MY SECOND HOUSE WILL SATISFY MARIE'S CONCERNS ABOUT SIZE 
AS WELL AS STIRRING CHRIS'S CREATIVE FLAIR IN THE RENOVATIONS DEPARTMENT 
PLUS THERE IS A POSSIBLE BUSINESS BONUS FEATURE IN THE GARDEN 
RIGHT O. K. SO DOWNSTAIRS QUITE AN OPEN PLAN LAYOUT 
THIS IS THE SITTING ROOM O. K. 
BIG OPEN FIREPLACE THAT IS NICE IT LOOKS LIKE A PROPER FIRE AS WELL 
YEAH IT'S BIGGER SIZE WISE 
IT DOESN'T FEEL MUCH BIGGER 
IT'S GOT QUITE LOW CEILINGS 
IT'S STILL VERY LOW AND IT'S STILL DARK AND FEELS QUITE CLOSED IN 
I WOULD PAINT THESE WHITE BECAUSE I THINK THESE ARE VERY OPPRESSIVE 
IT'S QUITE DARK AND MAYBE THE LEATHER SOFAS ARE THE THINGS O. K. 
LET ME SHOW YOU SOME MORE SO VERY OPEN PLAN 
NEXT DOOR YOU'VE GOT A DINING ROOM 
OH THIS IS MUCH BRIGHTER YEAH 
THIS FEELS A LOT BETTER IN HERE 
A LOT OF NATURAL LIGHT COMING IN WHICH IS NICE 
I KNOW THAT THIS STYLE IS NOT TO YOUR TASTE 
AND I THINK YOU NEED TO IMAGINE IT AS IT BLANK CANVAS 
YES A PROJECT DEFINITELY 
IT'S QUITE HARD TO SEE BEYOND BUT YOU ARE RIGHT 
WITH EVERYTHING OUT IT WOULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT I'M SURE THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF SCOPE 
PAINTING AND DECORATING MAYBE CHANGING THE FLOORS GETTING SOME STONE IN HERE 
SOME FLOORBOARDS OR SOMETHING 
IT MIGHT BRIGHTEN IT UP DEFINITELY THE CURTAINS IN THE WINDOWS 
BECAUSE YOU GET A LOT OF SUN IN FROM THE SOUTH THERE 
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT LET ME SHOW YOU THE KITCHEN ON YOU GO 
CHRIS IS DOING HIS BEST TO SEE BEYOND THE DARKNESS OF THE BEAMS AND FURNITURE 
HOPEFULLY THE POTENTIAL OF THE KITCHEN SPACE WILL BE CLEARER TO VISUALISE 
O. K. THE KITCHEN I THINK THIS IS A FAR MORE SENSIBLE LAYOUT IN TERMS OF 
DINING ROOM KITCHEN YEAH YEAH ALL ON THE SAME FLOOR 
AS OPPOSED TO THE FIRST PROPERTY WHICH WAS VERY LONG AND THIN WASN'T IT 
YEAH SLIGHTLY MORE CHILD FRIENDLY 
NICE THE CONNECTION AS WELL 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO MAKE A BIT MORE OF THAT OPEN IT OUT A BIT MORE 
THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE FRONT ROOM YEAH MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE 
SO YOU'VE GOT AN EXTRA SPACE THERE FOR A HUGE FRIDGE FREEZER 
YEAH HUGE THAT'S REALLY GOOD 
SO PLENTY OF SPACE FOR ALL YOUR WHITE GOODS INTEGRATED APPLIANCES 
STAINLESS STEEL HOOD YEAH I CAN SEE IT NOW 
ALSO WHAT WOULD BE GREAT IS GETTING A BIT MORE OF THAT CONNECTION 
BETWEEN HERE AND THE KITCHEN AND THE LIVING ROOM 
BECAUSE FREYA COULD PLAYED DOWN THERE 
MAKE IT MORE OPEN PLAN EXACTLY WHILST WE ARE IN HERE COOKING 
AND HIGH CEILINGS IN HERE YES IT'S NOT SO BAD 
EVEN FOR YOU AT SIX FOOT 
RIGHT LET ME SHOW YOU THERE'S A CONSERVATORY 
CHRIS'S CREATIVE JUICES ARE FREELY FLOWING WHICH I TAKE AS A REALLY POSITIVE SIGN 
I WAS THINKING THAT GO ON YOU START 
NO I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY IT'S QUITE A BIG CONSERVATORY 
YEAH IT'S A GOOD SPACE IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR FREYA TO PLAY IN YES 
WHICH IS WHAT PROPERTY NUMBER ONE LACKED AN EXTRA RECEPTION ROOM 
YEAH THAT'S TRUE NEAR THE KITCHEN WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT IT LOOKS OUT ON TO A LOVELY GARDEN 
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT I FIRST NOTICED WHEN I WALKED OUT WAS THE GARDEN 
YEAH GOOD HOLD THAT THOUGHT 
LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND THE INSIDE OF THE HOUSE AND WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT 
I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL ABOUT THE NEXT ROOM 
O. K. FAMILY BATHROOM IS ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
THAT'S NOT IDEAL NO 
BUT IT'S A BIG SPACE A BIG ROOM 
A BIG BATHROOM WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT YEAH GOOD TO HAVE A SHOWER AND A BATH 
MARIE IS TRYING HER BEST TO FIND POSITIVES BUT I CAN TELL MY SECOND HOUSE HAS NOT WON HER OVER YET 
MAYBE SHE'LL FIND THE UPSTAIRS AND THE FOUR BEDROOMS MORE TO HER TASTE 
RIGHT OH 
THIS IS YOUR MASTER BEDROOM SUITE 
THIS IS LOVELY SUITE 
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE VANITY UNIT THERE YEAH 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY INCORPORATE AN EN SUITE BATHROOM IN THIS ROOM SOMEHOW 
YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE MASSIVE I REALLY LIKE THE TALL CEILINGS THAT'S GREAT 
COME UP HERE AND HAVE A LOOK THIS IS THE BEDROOM 
LOOK AT THIS BEHIND THE CURTAINS 
IT'S NICE TO COME UPSTAIRS TO THE BEDROOM ISN'T IT 
YEAH I LIKE IT AS WELL 
O. K. SO A BIG FIRST BEDROOM 
IT IS BIG THIS IS MUCH 
YOU DON'T EXPECT THIS FROM DOWNSTAIRS BECAUSE IT WAS LOW 
SO IT'S NICE TO HAVE SUCH OPEN ROOMS UP HERE 
THE WHOLE SUITE IS BRILLIANT WE COULD MAKE AN EN SUITE DOWN THERE 
NO SHORTAGE OF STORAGE YEAH EXACTLY 
ALL RIGHT OFF YOU GO 
THINGS ARE GETTING BIGGER AND BETTER UPSTAIRS BUT I'M STILL NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SURE WHAT MY BUYERS MAKE OF THIS HOUSE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE FOUR BEDROOMS 
NICE BEADED CURTAIN A BIT TALES OF THE UNEXPECTED 
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THAT IN TOTAL THERE ARE TWO SINGLE BEDROOMS AND TWO DOUBLES ON THE FIRST FLOOR 
IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT FEEL UPSTAIRS HASN'T IT 
IT'S MUCH BIGGER I MUCH PREFER UPSTAIRS THAN DOWNSTAIRS 
RIGHT THERE'S ONE THING THAT WASN'T AVAILABLE IN PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
BUT IS IN THIS ONE 
AND IT WAS QUITE IMPORTANT TO YOU WHEN YOU INITIALLY BRIEFED ME 
AND IT'S IN THE GARDEN AND I WANT TO SHOW IT TO YOU NOW 
CHRIS AND MARIE GENUINELY SEEMED INTRIGUED BY MY SURPRISE 
SO THEY ARE CLEARLY STILL INTERESTED IN MY SECOND HOUSE 
QUITE A NICE BIG GARDEN ISN'T IT 
REALLY BIG 
WOW BIG GARAGE IT'S HUGE YEAH 
SO RIGHT AT THE END OF THE GARDEN YOU HAVE THIS HUGE FREE STANDING 
MAZE OF LITTLE ROOMS 
CURRENTLY SET UP AS AN OFFICE 
IS THAT AN ENTRANCE FROM THE STREET 
YES COMPLETELY SEPARATE ENTRANCE 
THERE IS SOME SCOPE THERE FOR HAVING CLIENTS IF YOU DID HAVE A BUSINESS 
I'M THINKING OF MY REFLEXOLOGY BUSINESS YES DEFINITELY 
SHALL WE TALK ABOUT MONEY YES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ON THE MARKET FOR 
I WAS THINKING REALLY LOW UNTIL I SAW THIS 
DON'T FORGET THE LOCATION IS EXCELLENT FOR COMMUTERS 
AND THERE ARE TWO DOUBLES AND TWO SINGLES SO FOUR BEDROOMS 
YOU GUESS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
I WOULD HAVE SAID A B. O. U. T. THREE TWENTY EIGHT 
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
ACTUALLY YOU'RE CLOSER IT IS ON THE MARKET FOR THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND REALLY 
IT HAS BEEN ON FOR FOUR MONTHS SO PERHAPS THERE IS SOME ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION 
FOR THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND AND WELL WITHIN THE BUDGET IS THIS FOUR BED GRADE TWO LISTED ATTACHED COTTAGE 
THE MAIN SELLING POINT IS THE POTENTIAL OF THE LARGE DETACHED OUTBUILDING 
FOR THEIR FUTURE BUSINESS VENTURES 
THAT IS QUITE AN INTERESTING CURVE BALL BECAUSE INSIDE 
EVEN THOUGH THE HOUSE WAS BIGGER I THINK THEY JUST DIDN'T GET THE FEEL 
ALTHOUGH OUTSIDE THIS EXTRA SPACE WHICH COULD BE CONVERTED FOR BUSINESS USE COULD HAVE POTENTIAL 
MY INITIAL IMPRESSION OF THE HOUSE WAS VERY NEGATIVE 
I CAME IN AND THOUGHT THIS IS NOT FOR US 
DEFINITELY GOT BETTER AS WE WENT INSIDE AND UPSTAIRS 
THE ROOMS GOT A BIT BIGGER AND IT FELT A BIT MORE SPACIOUS 
AND THEN I REALLY LIKE THE GARDEN AND THE OUTHOUSES 
THAT WAS QUITE EXCITING 
HAD POTENTIAL FOR THE PROJECT OF THE BUSINESS 
SO I HAVE MIXED VIEWS ON THE OVERALL PROPERTY 
HI 
HI 
GOOD IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECAP I THINK AND HAVE A LOOK ROUND ON YOUR OWN 
SO FAR YOU HAVE SEEN TWO AND I STILL HAVE TWO MORE TO SHOW YOU 
IT IS FREEZING SO SHALL WE GO TO MOVE ON 
YES 
MARIE IS REALLY INTERESTED IN HOLISTIC TREATMENTS SUCH AS REFLEXOLOGY AND RAIKI 
EVENTUALLY WHEN THEY RELOCATE SHE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE BUSINESSES FROM HOME 
THAT IS WHY I'VE ARRANGED TO MEET ALISON DRAPER WHO IS A REFLEXOLOGIST AND ALSO NEW TO THE AREA 
I HAVE COME TO ASK HER LOADS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WORKING IN THIS AREA IN THAT LINE OF BUSINESS 
YOU ARE TRAINED AS A REFLEXOLOGIST 
EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT 
YOUR FEET ARE MAP OF YOUR BODY AND YOUR NERVE ENDINGS ARE ALL IN YOUR FEET 
SO BY STIMULATING THE NERVE ENDINGS AND THE BLOOD SUPPLY IN YOUR FEET 
IT DIRECTLY HAS A RELATION TO THE ORGANS AND PARTS OF YOUR BODY 
YOU WORK FROM HOME HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR HUSBAND 
IT IS GREAT THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I DID IT BECAUSE 
I CAN DO IT AT WEEKENDS AND EVENINGS WHEN MY HUSBAND IS HOME WHEN THE KIDS ARE AT SCHOOL AND PLAYGROUPS 
I CAN FIT IT IN COMPLETELY 
HOW DID YOU ADVERTISE YOUR BUSINESS 
I AM VERY LUCKY THAT I HAVE A WEBSITE 
I DO A COUPLE OF ADVERTS IN LOCAL PARISH MAGAZINES AND OFFERING RAFFLE PRIZES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
IT IS A CASE OF NETWORKING 
IT IS WORD OF MOUTH AND PEOPLE KNOWING WHO YOU ARE 
WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH OUR VIEWING AGENDA AND I'M NOT SURE HOUSES ONE AND TWO 
HAVE QUITE HIT THE MARK FOR CHRIS AND MARIE 
LET'S EARWIG IN ON THEIR THOUGHTS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE MADE OF HOUSE ONE 
IT WAS REALLY CUTE IT WAS LIKE A LITTLE CHOCOLATE BOX HOUSE 
NOT REALLY ENOUGH BEDROOMS NOT VERY PRACTICAL ON THAT FRONT 
HAVING TWO STAIRS IS GOOD FOR GUESTS BUT NOT FOR TWO BABIES RUNNING AROUND 
THEY MIGHT FALL DOWN THE STAIRS 
AND NOT MUCH SCOPE FOR DEVELOPMENT EITHER 
LIKE IT BUT IF IT WAS TWICE AS BIG IT WOULD BE A GOER 
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF NUMBER TWO 
IT WAS A BIGGER HOUSE HAD A LOT OF POTENTIAL 
WITH THE OUTBUILDINGS 
UPSTAIRS SPACE WAS GOOD BUT OVERALL IT WAS QUITE DARK IN THERE 
AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE WOULD END UP WITH ANYTHING WE LIKED EVEN IF WE PUT A LOT OF WORK IN 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT COMING UP I FIND A HOUSE AND MARIE LOVES IT 
I CAN IMAGINE LIVING HERE MOVING IN VERY SOON 
AND CHRIS FEARS HE WILL HAVE HIS WORK CUT OUT CONTROLLING HIS WIFE'S DESIRES 
I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE A HARD JOB KEEPING HER FROM WANTING TO JUST PUT AN OFFER IN 
SO FAR CHRIS AND MARIE HAVE VIEWED TWO PROPERTIES 
THEY STILL HAVE TWO MORE TO SEE ONE OF WHICH IS MY MYSTERY HOUSE WHICH IS ARCHITECTURALLY VERY INTERESTING 
MY THIRD HOUSE IS IN BULKINGTON 
LOCATED ON THE EDGE OF SALISBURY PLAIN 
THE VILLAGE HAS A CHOICE OF THREE MARKET TOWNS 
ALL WITHIN A TEN MINUTE DRIVE TROWBRIDGE DEVIZES AND MELKSHAM 
I TOOK ON BOARD ALL OUR LITTLE CHATS ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS 
STYLE WISE THIS HOUSE SITS BETWEEN PROPERTY NUMBER ONE AND PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
THERE IS STILL A PROJECT BUT NOT AS MUCH TO DO BLACK BEAMS 
IT DOES NOT HAVE THE OPPRESSIVE BLACK BEAMS ON THE CEILING 
DID YOU WANT THEM NO 
LET'S GO INSIDE 
HAVING LEARNT FROM MY FIRST TWO PROPERTIES I THINK MY THIRD HOUSE HAS THE RIGHT BLEND OF POTENTIAL 
AND SPACIOUSNESS MARIE AND CHRIS ARE AFTER LET US SEE IF THEY AGREE 
RIGHT FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
VERY POSITIVE LOVE THE FLOOR 
THE FLOOR IS GORGEOUS 
LOVELY PARQUET 
LIKE BACK TO SCHOOL YOU LIKE THAT 
YES IT LOOKS GOOD SO FAR 
GOOD FIRST IMPRESSIONS LET ME SHOW YOU THE DINING ROOM 
AFTER YOU 
THIS IS NICE FIREPLACE THREE FIRES GREAT 
GOOD FEATURE A VERY GOOD FEATURE 
WHAT ABOUT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE ROOM IT IS FINE 
IT'S NOT MASSIVE IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE 
WE HAVE A TABLE ABOUT THAT SIZE THAT WOULD FIT NICELY 
YOU CAN IMAGINE YOUR FAMILY IN HERE 
YES YES DEFINITELY 
IF THEY LIKE THE DINING ROOM AND I'M PRETTY SURE THEY WILL BE IMPRESSED 
BY THE BESPOKE TIMBER FRAME EXTENSION 
THIS IS SUPERB IN HERE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT PERFECT 
IT HAS GOT A WOW FACTOR THIS ROOM 
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE THE STYLE OF IT 
THIS IS REALLY GOOD 
LOOK AT YOUR OUTLOOK THAT IS LOVELY 
THE GARDEN CANYOU 
AND IT DOESN'T LOOK OVER ANYTHING EITHER 
REALLY SAFE AND ENCLOSED AND A HOT TUB 
AHA HOLD THAT THOUGHT 
ON THAT BASIS OF POSITIVE ENERGY DO YOU WANT TO SEE MORE OF THE HOUSE 
YES LET'S KEEP GOING 
IT'S GENUINELY NICE 
YIPPEE NOW FOR A ROOM POSSIBLY FOR THE LITTLE ONES 
ANOTHER NICE ONE 
IN TERMS OF NEEDING AN EXTRA SPACE FOR FREYA LIKE A PLAY ROOM YOU HAVE OPTIONS HERE 
YOU COULD MOVE IN AND JUST DO THESE LITTLE ROOMS UP ROOM BY ROOM 
JUST TO YOUR OWN TASTE IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE DONE IMMEDIATELY 
NO PARTICULARLY WITH A NEW BABY COMING GOOD O. K. THE KITCHEN 
THERE YOU GO 
THANK YOU THIS IS NICE 
THIS IS A GOOD SIZE ISN'T IT 
ONE BLACK BEAM ONE BLACK BEAM IS ALL RIGHT 
I CAN LIVE WITH ONE BLACK BEAM 
YES WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT 
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT ONE STRIP IT LIKE THAT LINTEL OVER THERE 
THAT'S LOVELY IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS REALLY OLD AND THE AGA 
PLENTY OF SPACE TO EAT WITHIN HERE 
YES REALLY BRIGHT AGAIN AND MORE DOORS GOING OUTSIDE 
IT IS REALLY NICE 
AND YOU HAVE AN AREA ROUND THERE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK A UTILITY SPACE 
SO PLENTY OF ROOM FOR YOUR WASHING MACHINE YOUR DRIER YOUR FRIDGE FREEZER GREAT 
KEEP THE NOISE AWAY AS WELL 
AND A LITTLE DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 
WITH THE MUDDY BOOTS LEAVE IT ALL OUT HERE 
NO FAMILY BATHROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
RESULT 
IT IS REALLY GOOD DESIGN 
I LIKE IT IT IS REALLY GOOD 
REALLY PRACTICAL CAN I SHOW YOU THE BEDROOMS 
YES LET'S GO UPSTAIRS OFF YOU GO 
I THINK THEY REALLY LIKE THIS ONE 
I CAN SENSE THAT CHRIS'S CREATIVE JUICES ARE FLOWING AND MARIE IS KIND OF THINKING FROM A NESTING 
POINT OF VIEW IT IS GOOD IT'LL WORK FOR HER FAMILY 
THIS IS A NICE BIG DOUBLE 
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
VERY BIG LIKE 
YES I LIKE IT AGAIN WINDOWS ON TWO SIDES MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE AND THE HIGH CEILINGS 
GOOD EN SUITE SHOWER ROOM 
EXCELLENT NOT JUST A CUPBOARD 
THIS IS HANDY THIS IS HANDY 
IT IS A GOOD SIZE AS WELL AND GOOD TO HAVE A SHOWER 
THIS HAS GOT GOOD BALANCE GOOD VIBES AS WELL 
THEY SEEM TO LIKE WHAT COULD BE THEIR BEDROOM WITH EN SUITE 
BUT IS THERE ENOUGH SPACE FOR THEIR EXPANDING FAMILY 
ANOTHER BEDROOM WITH A DOUBLE 
SO YOU'VE GOT FOUR BEDROOMS IN TOTAL TWO DOUBLES TWO SINGLES 
THAT'S GOOD THAT'S WHAT WE WANT REALLY DEFINITELY IDEAL 
AGAIN IT'S JUST BLANK 
YEAH COULD REALLY MAKE OUR MARK AGAIN DON'T YOU THINK YEAH I DO 
MAYBE STRIP THE FLOOR BOARDS PULL UP THIS CARPET 
IT'S GOOD TO SEE CHRIS IS ALREADY PLANNING A REFURB 
THE TWO SINGLE BEDROOMS ARE NEXT TO THE FAMILY BATHROOM BUT THAT HAS A BATH AND A SEPARATE SHOWER 
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT'S ON OFFER OUTSIDE 
O. K. SO IN THE GARDEN A LITTLE POND 
O. K. YEAH WE COULD CHILD PROOF THAT I THINK NOT TOO BIG YEAH 
YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF SHEDS 
GOOD FOR STORAGE GET THE LAWNMOWERS IN OUT OF SIGHT 
HOT TUB 
YEAH NOW THAT IS GOOD DO YOU LIKE THEM I DO 
SO MONEY HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR 
I RECKON IT WOULD BE QUITE EXPENSIVE 
I'M THINKING TOP END OF OUR BUDGET 
I AGREE I DO I THINK 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND MAYBE 
THIS IS ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THAT DOES SEEM ABOUT RIGHT 
THAT'S STILL UNDER OUR BUDGET THAT'S QUITE GOOD WITH ALL THIS STUFF 
DONE ALREADY YEAH BUT STILL A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY POTENTIALLY TO IMPROVE IT 
YEAH AND BUY THE SPA 
I LIKE YOUR THINKING GO AND CHECK OUT THAT AND I'LL SEE YOU SHORTLY 
FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MARIE AND CHRIS COULD AFFORD THIS FOUR BEDROOMED DETACHED HOUSE 
IT HAS A CHOICE OF RECEPTION ROOMS PROVIDING THAT ALL IMPORTANT SPACE 
AND A HOT TUB IN THE GARDEN THAT'S CAUGHT CHRIS'S EYE 
INITIAL DEPRESSIONS I WAS SORT OF FIFTY TO FIFTY 
I COULD SEE THERE WAS POTENTIAL SOME WORK HAD BEEN DONE TO THE HOUSE WHICH LOOKED PROMISING 
AND AS SOON AS WE WENT IN IT REALLY OPENS OUT AND THEN THIS CONSERVATORY AT THE BACK IS JUST SUPERB 
I CAN IMAGINE LIVING HERE MOVING IN VERY SOON 
KITCHEN IS GREAT IT'S A VERY FAMILY ORIENTATED HOUSE 
IN TERMS OF WHAT MARIE WOULD THINK 
I'VE GOT A SENSE THAT SHE REALLY LOVES THIS PLACE ALREADY SO I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE A HARD JOB 
KEEPING HER FROM WANTING TO JUST PUT AN OFFER IN ACTUALLY 
HI HI 
STILL SMILING GOOD BOTH OF YOU 
YEAH POSITIVE 
YEAH O. K. SO FAR YOU'VE SEEN THREE 
YES I DO WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE MORE SO PLEASE BE OPEN MINDED 
YEAH WE WILL NOW IT'S MY MYSTERY HOUSE 
I KNOW YOU LOVE THAT ONE BUT 
MYSTERY IS GOOD IT MIGHT GET BETTER 
ONE OF THE REASONS MARIE AND CHRIS WANT TO MOVE TO THE COUNTRYSIDE 
AND AWAY FROM LONDON IS TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE GREAT OUTDOORS 
WITH CHRIS BEING UP FOR A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE I ARRANGED FOR HIM TO GO 
WAKE BOARDING WHICH IS BASICALLY WATER SKIING WITH JUST ONE SKI 
STEVE DYER IS HIS INSTRUCTOR 
JUST MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND TIGHT 
WE DON'T WANT IT COMING ABOVE YOUR HEAD CAN YOU STILL BREATHE JUST ABOUT 
ONCE FULLY KITTED OUT CHRIS HITS THE WATER LITERALLY 
MARIE WISELY WATCHES FROM THE SAFETY OF THE BOAT AS FINALLY CHRIS FINDS HIS WATER WINGS 
SO THAT'S ANOTHER SPORT TO ADD TO CHRIS' LIST BUT IT'S NOW TIME FOR A MORE SEDATE ACTIVITY HOUSE VIEWING 
THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO UNVEIL MY FOURTH AND FINAL PROPERTY THE MYSTERY HOUSE 
NOW REMEMBER MARIE AND CHRIS KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SO I'M HOPING ITS UNIQUE INTERIOR AND RURAL SETTING 
MAKE IT THE PERFECT FINALE TO OUR TIME IN WILTSHIRE 
IT'S IN THE VILLAGE OF BRADENSTOKE THE SAME LOCATION 
AS MY SECOND PROPERTY 
IN YOU COME O. K. 
MY MYSTERY HOUSE PROPERTY NUMBER FOUR 
I'VE THROWN THIS INTO THE MIX COS THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
ARCHITECTURALLY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING

I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU COULD MOVE IN IT'S BEAUTIFUL INSIDE YEAH 
ALL RIGHT YEAH COME ON

BUT I'M SURE THAT ONCE THEY'RE INSIDE THEY'LL UNDERSTAND WHY I'VE SAVED IT FOR LAST 
THANKS

VERY PLEASANT NICE VERY BIG 
BESIDE THE FACT THAT IT'S BOILING OUTSIDE IT'S NICE AND COOL 
IT FEELS COOL IN HERE DOESN'T IT YEAH 
YOU'VE GOT THE EXPOSED BRICK ON THE WALLS OBVIOUSLY 
I REALLY LIKE THAT LOVELY STONE ON THE FLOOR 
IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT TO WHAT WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S NICE THE WAY IT OPENS OUT ONTO THE FRONT THERE YOU COULD JUST OPEN THESE DOORS UP I IMAGINE 
AND SORT OF BE EATING HERE AND COOKING AND FREYA PLAYING AROUND IN THE GARDEN THAT'D BE NICE 
SPIRAL STAIRCASE 
NOT SO GOOD FOR FAMILY LIFE 
BUT A FEATURE 
BUT IT ISN'T THE BEST 
NO I LIKE THAT WE'D HAVE TO JUST HAVE A SAFETY MEASURE IN PLACE 
BUT IT'S NICE I LIKE IT 
YEAH GOOD LET ME SHOW YOU MORE 
THAT'S AN INSIGHT AND A HALF INTO HOW MY BUYERS' MINDS WORK 
PRACTICAL MARIE WROTE THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE OFF BUT DESIGNER CHRIS SAW IT AS A POSITIVE FEATURE 
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL AGREE ON THE REST OF THE HOUSE

DON'T THINK FREYA IS GONNA FALL OVER 
WELL YOU GET RUGS AND YOU MAKE IT A BIT COSIER BUT I THINK IT'S A NICE 
BIG SPACE ESPECIALLY WITH THE BIG DOORWAY TO THE KITCHEN 
O. K. LET ME SHOW YOU THE BEDROOM ONE OF THE BEDROOMS 
NOW IT'S CHRIS BEING NEGATIVE AND MARIE COMING UP WITH THE SOLUTION THEY CLEARLY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER 
OFF THE LOUNGE THERE'S A ROOM THAT'S LISTED AS 
A BEDROOM BUT COULD BE USED AS A PLAYROOM FOR THE CHILDREN OR FOR MARIE'S REFLEXOLOGY BUSINESS 
AND AT THE FAR END OF THE COACH HOUSE IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
VAULTED CEILINGS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS EXPOSED PLASTER WORK 
YES IT'S LIKE A LITTLE CAVE 
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE MASTER BEDROOM 
AH RIGHT 
THIS IS THE BIGGEST ROOM 
IT'S GOT A BEAM WANT TO SEE MORE 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
JUST ACROSS THE CORRIDOR AND CONVENIENT FOR THE MASTER BEDROOM IS THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
THAT'S QUITE NICE THAT'S GOOD ISN'T IT 
WITH A ROLL TOP BATH AND A SHOWER 
FAMILY BATHROOM THIS IS THE ONLY ONE AND IT'S ON THE GROUND FLOOR SO SOMETHING FOR YOU TO BE MINDFUL OF 
MIND YOU BEDROOM IS ON THE GROUND FLOOR AS WELL 
YEAH COULD BE EASY COULDN'T IT COULD BE LOUNGE BATH BED EASY 
YEAH 
THERE ARE TWO IDENTICAL WINGS TO THE UPSTAIRS THAT ARE UP THE LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM SPIRAL STAIRS 
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SIZE 
YEAH QUITE BIG UP HERE ACTUALLY YOU'RE IN THE ROOF 
IT'S BIGGER THAN YOU EXPECT YEAH 
AND THE OTHER BEDROOM IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THIS ONE 
SAME SIZE EXACTLY YEAH 
SO FOUR BEDROOMS IN TOTAL 
O. K. SHALL I SHOW YOU THE GARDEN YEAH LET'S HAVE A LOOK OFF WE GO 
MIND YOUR STEP 
I THINK CHRIS AND MARIE LIKE MY MYSTERY HOUSE ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD TO TELL 
CERTAIN ROOMS AND FEATURES ARE GETTING THE THUMBS UP 
BUT I'M NOT QUITE FEELING THE UNRESTRAINED LOVE I WAS HOPING FOR 
THIS IS ALL RATHER CHARMING ISN'T IT 
THIS IS VERY CHARMING UP HERE 
SO THIS FORMERLY WAS A CATTLE SHED 
IF YOU SEE THE BOUNDARIES 
THE STONE WALL RUNS ROUND THERE LOOK AT THAT CIRCULAR WINDOW 
YEAH IT'S REALLY CUTE 
AND THEN RIGHT DOWN THERE CAN YOU SEE THAT STONE WALL YEAH RIGHT THE FULL LENGTH DOWN THERE 
GOT A LOVELY VIEW BUT YOU'RE NOT OVERLOOKING ANYBODY ARE YOU 
NO ONLY A FEW LAMBS 
YES AND A PEACOCK SQUAWKING AWAY 
O. K. SHALL WE GUESS THE PRICE 
DO YOU THINK THIS IS MORE EXPENSIVE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE OTHERS 
I RECKON THIS IS QUITE PRICEY COS IT'S GOT THAT SORT OF BOUTIQUE LOOK 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
EVERYTHING'S REALLY POLISHED 
A BIT LIKE THE FIRST ONE BUT NOT COTTAGEY MORE LIKE BOUTIQUE HOTEL 
I'D SAY HIGH AGAIN ALTHOUGH IT'S QUITE SMALL INSIDE I RECKON FOUR HUNDRED 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON I'LL GO HIGHER 
FOUR HUNDRED TEN 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
THAT IS EXPENSIVE 
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YEAH IT'S VERY CHARMING IT IS 
MY MYSTERY HOUSE IS AT THE TOP OF CHRIS AND MARIE'S BUDGET AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
BUT THE CONVERTED COACH HOUSE DOES COME WITH A LARGE KITCHEN FOUR BEDROOMS 
AND A GOOD SIZED GARDEN COMPLETE WITH THE REMAINS OF THE COWSHED 
THE MYSTERY HOUSE I'M REALLY GLAD WE SAW IT COS WE'VE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT LOOKING AT A BARN CONVERSION AND HAVEN'T SORTED THAT ONE OUT SO IT WAS REALLY GOOD TO SEE 
IT'S A LITTLE GEM OF A PROPERTY IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'D LOVE TO HAVE FOUND I THINK TEN YEARS AGO BEFORE 
SOMEONE HAD COME ALONG AND DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB AT ACTUALLY REFURBISHING MAKING THIS PROJECT HOW IT IS TODAY 
THIS IS WHY I WAS HOPING THIS PROPERTY 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT CHEAPER BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN KYBOSHED 
I THINK AS A COUPLE WE'D REALLY LIKE IT BUT AS A FAMILY IT JUST DIDN'T REALLY WORK 
HELLO HIYA 
ALL RIGHT YES VERY MUCH 
ALL FINISHED YEAH 
YES THINK SO WE'VE GOT LOTS TO THINK ABOUT 
O. K. SO YOU'VE SEE ALL FOUR NOW 
ON CUE SHALL WE GO AND HAVE A THINK 
YES LET'S THINK 
BEFORE WE HEAR WHAT MY BUYERS HAVE TO SAY HERE'S A QUICK REMINDER OF ALL FOUR OF THE PROPERTIES 
THE FIRST HOUSE ON THE LIST IS THE GRADE TWO LISTED THATCHED COTTAGE IN MARDEN ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IT HAS FOUR BEDROOMS BUT PERHAPS NOT THE SCOPE FOR CHRIS TO MAKE HIS OWN DECORATIVE MARK 
HOUSE NUMBER TWO IS THE ATTACHED FOUR BED COTTAGE IN BRADENSTOKE 
IT'S EASILY WITHIN BUDGET AT THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND AND COMES WITH A LARGE GARAGE 
BUT THE DARK RECEPTION ROOMS MAY RULE IT OUT 
MY THIRD HOUSE IS THE DETACHED FOUR BED PROPERTY IN BULKINGTON PRICED AT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IT HAS ROOM FOR A PLAYROOM AND MARIE'S REFLEXOLOGY BUSINESS AND IT'S ALSO GOT A HOT TUB 
FINALLY MY MYSTERY PROPERTY THE CONVERTED COACH HOUSE 
IN BRADENSTOKE BANG ON BUDGET AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
I THINK MARIE AND CHRIS LIKE THE STANDARD OF FINISH BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT THE OVERALL DIMENSIONS 
JUST FALL SHORT OF THEIR EXPECTATIONS 
NOW THE MOMENT OF TRUTH HAS ARRIVED 
SO YOU'VE SEEN FOUR PROPERTIES YEAH YEAH 
I'M VERY INTERESTED IN YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT EACH ONE 
YEAH POSITIVES NEGATIVES 
SHALL WE START WITH THE CHOCOLATE BOX THE FIRST ONE I SHOWED YOU 
YEAH YEAH I THINK IT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL 
BUT WE'RE JUST NOT A CHOCOLATE BOX TYPE OF COUPLE OR FAMILY 
NO PREFER TO EAT THEM 
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
IT IS VERY LIKE TINY 
WELL FORMED BUT IT WASN'T FOR US WE COULDN'T REALLY DO MUCH WITH IT 
YOU WOULD FEEL BAD TO CHANGE ANYTHING IN THAT PROPERTY COS IT WAS SO WELL DONE 
NUMBER TWO THE BLACK BEAMS ON THE CEILINGS A LOVELY BIG HOUSE WITH THAT SEPARATE GARAGE AREA 
IT DID HAVE THAT SORT OF POTENTIAL FOR EXTENSIONS 
YEAH IT HAD POTENTIAL CUT TO THE CHASE YOUR FACE WHEN I WALKED IN 
IT WASN'T GOOD I FELT IT WAS TOO DARK 
IT WASN'T A GOOD OPEN SPACE NUMBER THREE 
THAT'S A DIFFERENT KETTLE OF FISH 
WE REALLY LIKE NUMBER THREE YEAH THAT IS A REAL FIND I THINK 
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE I COULD IMAGINE MOVING IN THERE TODAY 
LITTLE BITS WERE DONE REALLY WELL 
I LIKE THAT SO I THINK WE COULD DO THE SAME IF WE WANTED TO TAKE THIS FURTHER WITH THAT PROPERTY 
ADD TO IT MAKE IT PERSONAL TO US 
MAYBE EXTEND IT OR WHATEVER 
AND FOUR THE FORMER COACH HOUSE 
YEAH THE MYSTERY HOUSE THAT WAS REALLY GOOD TO SEE ACTUALLY 
WE HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE A BARN 
IT WAS DONE QUITE CONTEMPORARY WHICH WAS NICE AGAIN BUT IT DID FEEL LIKE 
A HOLIDAY HOME RATHER THAN AN ACTUAL HOME FOR A FAMILY 
I COULDN'T LIVE THERE ALL THE TIME 
WE'D FILL THAT IN A WEEKEND WITH ALL OF OUR STUFF 
TWO DOUBLE BUGGIES AND A COT BED ETC AND THEN FRIENDS COMING ROUND 
FRIENDS JUST WOULDN'T FIT IN WE'D HAVE TO GET A TENT IN THE GARDEN 
SO NUMBER THREE AM I RIGHT IN SAYING IS YOUR FAVOURITE 
YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO FROM HERE 
I THINK WE'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE AGENT AND SPEAK TO THE LOCALS IN THE VILLAGE GET A BIT MORE OF 
A FEEL FOR THE NEIGHBOURS ARE LIKE MAYBE HAVE A SECOND VIEWING YEAH 
PUT AN OFFER IN 
LOVELY TO MEET YOU BOTH AND YOURSELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
PLEASURE GOOD LUCK WITH BABY NUMBER TWO 
YEAH WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT AND OUR MOVE HOPEFULLY 
FINDING A HOME TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF A FAMILY WAS NEVER GOING TO BE EASY BUT THROW INTO 
THE MIX AN ARCHITECT OOH I HAD MY WORK CUT OUT 
FORTUNATELY THEY REALLY LIKED PROPERTY NUMBER THREE 
AND IF THEY DECIDE TO PUT AN OFFER IN I THINK IT'S GONNA MAKE A WONDERFUL FAMILY HOME 
NOW IF YOU'VE ENJOYED WHAT YOU'VE SEEN ON TODAY'S SHOW PLEASE JOIN ME NEXT TIME ON ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET 
YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
