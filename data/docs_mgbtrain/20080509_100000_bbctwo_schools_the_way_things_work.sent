YOU CAN WORK IT OUT IF YOU JUST LEARN ABOUT 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN RIDE 
OR BUMP AND JUMP GLIDE AND SLIDE 
TAKE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE THE WAY THINGS WORK 
AND WATCH THE THINGAMABOB THAT TURNS THE KNOB 
THAT MAKES THE JIGGER JIG 
THAT TURNS THE THINGAMAJIG THAT PULLS THE TRIGGER 
THAT MAKES THE DIGGER DIG 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN FLY 
WITHOUT A WING OR STRING TO TIE WITH 
YOU FIND THE SAME RULES APPLY WITH 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IT WAS A GLORIOUS DAY ON MAMMOTH ISLAND 
THE SUN WAS SHINING THE BIRDS WERE SINGING 
AND 
HELLO THERE 
WHAT'S UP WHAT OH HELLO OLIVE 
NOTHING'S UP I WAS JUST WONDERING 
WHAT IS THAT DELICIOUS SMELL 
WHAT OH THAT'LL BE AUNTIE BRENDA 
SHE'S BAKING FOR THE BARBECUE 
BRENDA'S BAKING WAS SO FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE ISLAND 
THAT SHE HAD CONVERTED HER SHED INTO A KITCHEN BAKERY 
THAT NIGHT THERE WAS TO BE A VILLAGE BARBECUE 
WITH BRENDA'S CAKES THE FINAL TREAT 
AND FOR THIS BARBECUE 
BRENDA WAS BAKING MORE CAKES THAN SHE HAD EVER BAKED BEFORE 
WHICH WAS PUTTING A STRAIN ON HER ALREADY OVERWORKED OVEN 
I LOVE BARBECUES BUT BRENDA'S CAKES ARE THE BEST 
A A AH 
AH 
A A AH 
FIRE 
FIRE 
OH DEAR 
FIRE 
FIRE 
SO IT WAS I CAUGHT MY FIRST SIGHT 
OF THE MAMMOTH ISLAND FIRE BRIGADE IN ACTION 
WHERE'S PILBEAM GOING THE FIRE STATION'S OVER THERE YOU'LL SEE 
THERE'S A GOOD MAMMOTH 
PILBEAM HAD DEVELOPED A TECHNIQUE 
FOR ENCOURAGING A MAMMOTH TO DRINK FAR MORE WATER THAN IT NEEDED 
INGENIOUS 
AND HAS PILBEAM TRAINED THE MAMMOTH TO SPRAY WATER OVER THE FIRE 
ER NOT EXACTLY 
OH HOW ODD WHATEVER DO THEY PLAN TO DO WITH THAT 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SURELY NOT 
SQUEEZE THE POOR MAMMOTH 
NO IT'S O. K. REALLY 
UH 
UH UH 
DON'T WORRY 
OOH I SAY 
READY LADS ONE TWO 
AH 
I KNEW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IT ALWAYS DOES 
NOW TROY WILL HAVE TO FEED THE MAMMOTH EXTRA HAY TO SAY SORRY 
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY BOTHER 
THEY GET ALL WET AND SCARE THE MAMMOTH AND 
LOOK AT MY SHED 
I'LL NEVER GET MY BAKING DONE IN TIME FOR THE BARBECUE NOW 
DON'T WORRY BRENDA I'VE SENT THE LADS HOME TO TURN ON THEIR OVENS 
IF WE ALL PULL TOGETHER WE'LL MAKE UP FOR LOST BAKING TIME 
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY BUT I'VE GOT TO MAKE A WHOLE NEW BATCH OF CAKE MIX 
WHILE BRENDA MADE MORE CAKE MIX 
FRANK GOT EVERYTHING ELSE ORGANISED 
SOON THE WHOLE ISLAND WAS BAKING CAKES FOR THE BARBECUE 
I THINK FRANK'S RIGHT THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF CAKES FOR THE BARBECUE 
OLIVE IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU 
WE NEED A BETTER WAY TO GET WATER FROM THE WATERING HOLE TO A FIRE 
IT SORT OF MAKES SENSE TO USE A MAMMOTH IT JUST NEVER WORKS OUT 
IF THERE WAS SOME KIND OF MACHINE WE COULD USE 
H. M. M. WHAT KIND OF MACHINE DO YOU HAVE IN MIND 
I DON'T KNOW 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD SUCK THE WATER IN AND THEN PUSH IT BACK OUT AGAIN 
A PUMP THAT'S WHAT WE NEED LIKE THIS ONLY FOR WATER 
YES THAT COULD WORK 
PUMPS WORK BY RAISING OR LOWERING THE PRESSURE OF A FLUID 
A FLUID CAN ACTUALLY BE A GAS LIKE AIR OR A LIQUID LIKE WATER 
ALL FLUIDS ARE MADE OF TINY PARTICLES CALLED MOLECULES 
AND THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE THEY'RE UNDER 
DEPENDS WHETHER THEY'RE PACKED TIGHTLY TOGETHER 
OR IF THEY HAVE ROOM TO MOVE ABOUT 
WHEN A PUMP'S PISTON PULLS BACK 
IT GIVES THE MOLECULES WITHIN THE PUMP'S CHAMBER EXTRA ROOM 
THIS REDUCES THE PRESSURE INSIDE THE PUMP 
BECAUSE THE PRESSURE IS GREATER OUTSIDE THAN INSIDE 
MOLECULES ARE FORCED THROUGH THE HOLE TO TAKE UP THE EXTRA SPACE 
AND WHEN THE PISTON IS PUSHED IN 
THE MOLECULES INSIDE ARE PRESSED TOGETHER INCREASING THE PRESSURE 
AND FORCING THE MOLECULES OUT THROUGH THE HOLE AT THE OTHER END 
BECAUSE THE PRESSURE INSIDE THE PUMP IS SO GREAT 
THE FLUID RUSHES OUT OF THE PUMP IN A POWERFUL STREAM 
ALL THAT PUSHING AND PULLING'S EASY IF THE PUMP'S SMALL 
BUT WE'D NEED A BIG PUMP TO PUT OUT A FIRE 
SO WE'D HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT EASIER TO PUMP 
H. M. M. AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD DO THAT 
HOW ABOUT SOME KIND OF LEVER 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD MOVE TO AND FRO AND DRIVE THE PISTON 
SOMETHING 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THE TO AND FRO MOTION OLIVE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
IS CALLED RECIPROCATION 
IT'S LIKE A SEE SAW WHEN ONE END GOES UP THE OTHER END GOES DOWN 
AND WHEN USED TO DRIVE THE PUMP 
THAT PUMP IS CALLED A RECIPROCATING PUMP 
THE INLET VALVE OPENS AND THE FLUID 
IN THIS CASE WATER IS FORCED IN 
LOOK AT THAT PISTON 
BECAUSE WHEN IT'S THEN PUSHED IN THE INLET VALVE SHUTS 
THE PRESSURE INCREASES 
THE OUTLET VALVE OPENS AND OUT WE GO 
OH 
SO OLIVE RUSHED BACK TO HER FATHER'S WORKSHOP 
AND FRANK WHO WAS TAKING A BREAK FROM CAKE BAKING SET TO WORK 
THIS THE SORT OF THING YOU HAD IN MIND OLIVE WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
IT'S ALMOST BARBECUE TIME 
WE'VE MADE A RECIPROCATING PUMP 
SO WE WON'T HAVE TO SQUEEZE ANY MORE MAMMOTHS 
I DON'T SEE HOW THERE'S HARDLY ANY ROOM FOR THE WATER IN THAT THING 
THERE ISN'T MEANT TO BE 
THE PUMP WILL LET US MOVE WATER FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER 
WITHOUT NEEDING A MAMMOTH WATCH 
UH 
IF I PUMP THIS HANDLE IT'S EASIER WHEN THERE'S TWO OF YOU 
AUNTIE BRENDA COULD YOU GRAB THE OTHER END 
UH 
IF I MUST YOU AND YOUR SILLY IDEAS 
UH UH UH UH UH 
THAT'S BETTER THANKS 
WHEN WE PUMP THIS HANDLE THE WATER IS SUCKED UP INSIDE THE PUMP 
THEN PUSHED OUT ALONG THE HOSE 
HOW'S IT WORKING DAD ER NOTHING THIS END OLIVE 
I WONDER WHAT WE DID WRONG DAD YOU'RE STANDING ON THE HOSE 
AM I HUH SILLY ME 
OH OH 
OH 
WHILE FRANK SET TO WORK BUILDING A BIGGER VERSION OF THE PUMP 
TROY LIT THE BARBECUE 
ER DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S ENOUGH WOOD TROY 
YEAH AND THAT WOOD PILE LOOKS A BIT CLOSE 
OLIVE AND FRANK WERE RIGHT 
IT WAS ANOTHER JOB FOR THE MAMMOTH ISLAND FIRE BRIGADE 
O. K. LADS GET PUMPING 
UH UH UH UH 
UH UH UH UH 
OH 
SORRY TROY 
THAT'S ENOUGH BOYS 
NICE ONE DAD 
NICE ONE OLIVE IT WAS YOUR IDEA AFTER ALL 
FIRE OUT GREAT 
NOW FOR THE BARBECUE 
OR MAYBE NOT AND I'M FEELING REALLY HUNGRY TOO 
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE I ARRIVED JUST IN TIME 
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP I'D NEVER HAVE GOT THEM BAKED IN TIME WITHOUT YOU 
GREAT TIMING BRENDA 
YEAH CAKE I LIKE CAKE 
WOO HOO CAKE'S READY 
YEAH 
EVEN THOUGH THINGS HADN'T TURNED OUT AS THEY'D EXPECTED 
THE ISLANDERS ALL AGREED 
IT WAS THE BEST BARBECUE THEY HAD NEVER HAD 
STORIES 
MY STORY'S ABOUT A CHILD RUNNING OUT OF SCHOOL 
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE CARETAKER LOOKS 
AND HE'S FRIGHTENED BECAUSE HE THINKS HE MIGHT EAT HIM 
HE COULD SEE I WAS TREMBLING I BRAVELY LOOKED UP AT HIM 
HE GRABBED HOLD OF MY HAND WITH HIS METAL CLAW 
WHY WERE YOU RUNNING AWAY SO FAST ASKED MR. WYLIMASSA IN A BROAD AFRICAN ACCENT 
YOU DROPPED YOUR KEYS AS YOU RAN OUT OF SCHOOL SO I WAS RUNNING AFTER YOU TO GIVE IT BACK 
I I I WAS SCARED I STAMMERED FROM THE SHOCK OF HEARING HIM SPEAK 
ONLY BECAUSE OF WHAT THE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SAYING I BLURTED OUT 
THEY SAY THAT YOU'RE FROM AN AFRICAN CANNIBAL TRIBE WHO EATS CHILDREN 
SO I WAS SCARED YOU MIGHT EAT ME 
MR. WYLIMASSA THREW HIS HEAD BACK AND LAUGHED 
NO NO I'M A VEGETARIAN 
I DON'T EAT CHILDREN HE REASSURED ME 
WHY WHY DO YOU SAY THIS 
IS IT BECAUSE OF THE WAY I LOOK 
HE SAT ME DOWN ON A NEARBY BENCH AND STARTED TELLING ME A STORY 
MANY MANY YEARS AGO I LIVED IN SOMALIA 
WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD MY MOTHER GOT VERY SICK 
SO THAT THE FAMILY HAD TO TRAVEL BY ROAD IN OUR JEEP TO NAIROBI FOR TREATMENT 
ON THE THIRD NIGHT OF OUR JOURNEY MY FATHER RODE THE JEEP OVER WHAT SEEMED TO BE A HUGE ROCK 
AN ALMIGHTY FIREBALL EMERGED FROM THE JEEP TOGETHER WITH A HORRENDOUS BLAST 
MY FATHER HAD DRIVEN THE JEEP STRAIGHT OVER A LANDMINE IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT 
LOCALS FROM THE NEARBY VILLAGES RUSHED TO OUR AID 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY MOTHER DUSA MY FATHER JAMATA AND SCISI MY SISTER 
WERE ALL KILLED INSTANTLY AND HORRIFICALLY 
I WAS THROWN OUT OF THE JEEP WITH THE EXPLOSION AND LANDED ON SOME LARGE ROCKS 
THAT IS HOW I LOST MY RIGHT EYE 
THESE SCARS YOU SEE ON MY FACE ARE ALSO INJURIES FROM THE ROCKS 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR ARM I ASKED CONCERNED 
THAT CAME OFF WITH THE EXPLOSION 
TEARS STREAMED DOWN MR. WYLIMASSA'S FACE 
I FOUND MYSELF GIVING HIM A HUG 
AS I THOUGHT HARD ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON I HAD LEARNT TODAY 
AND I HADN'T LEARNT IT AT SCHOOL
