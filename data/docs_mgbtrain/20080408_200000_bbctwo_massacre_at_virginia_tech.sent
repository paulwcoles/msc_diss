THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE 
THIS IS VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE UNIVERSITY 
OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IT WAS LITTLE KNOWN 
UNTIL LAST YEAR 
ON APRIL SIXTEENTH TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ONE OF ITS UNDERGRADUATES BROUGHT VIRGINIA TECH TO INTERNATIONAL FAME 
THIS STUDENT SEUNG HUI CHO ENTERED A RESIDENCE BLOCK AT AROUND SEVEN A M. 
HE WENT TO THE THIRD FLOOR 
THERE HE SHOT A YOUNG GIRL AND ANOTHER STUDENT WHO CAME TO HELP 
UN NOTICED THE KILLER RETURNED TO HIS ROOM 
METHODICALLY HE RE ARMED HIMSELF AND CHANGED HIS CLOTHES 
THEN HE POSTED A PACKAGE CONTAINING VIDEO CLIPS AND PHOTOS FROM NEARBY BLACKSBURG 
IT WAS ADDRESSED TO N. B. C. TELEVISION 
ON HIS RETURN TO CAMPUS HE WENT TO A CLASSROOM BUILDING NORRIS HALL 
CHAINED SHUT THE DOORS 
AND CALMLY EMBARKED ON THE WORST MASS SHOOTING IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY 
HE DIDN'T SPEAK AT ALL HE WAS COMPLETELY SILENT THE WHOLE TIME 
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK HE LOOKED OF THE AGE TO BE IN COLLEGE 
I WAS SURPRISED HE ENDED UP BEING TWENTY THREE 
ONCE I SORT OF CAME OUT OF THAT INITIAL SHOCK I DOVE UNDERNEATH 
MY DESK AND SOMEWHERE IN THAT MAYBE THREE TO FOUR SECONDS ER HE HAD SHOT ME ER JUST ONCE IN MY ARM 
I DID OPEN MY EYES A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT FIRST TIME HE WAS IN THE ROOM AND I JUST REMEMBER KIND OF 
SEEING HIM WALK AROUND HE WAS REALLY CALM STONE FACED NO EXPRESSION 
HE MAYBE FIRED TWENTY SHOTS TOTAL 
AND ER WENT DOWN THE HALL TO THE NEXT CLASS 
AND AT THAT POINT OUR CLASS WAS JUST DECIMATED 
NOBODY WAS MOVING NOBODY WAS SCREAMING 
IT WAS JUST THIS OVERWHELMING SMELL OF GUNPOWDER IN THE AIR 
YOU COULD ALMOST SEE IT IT WAS LIKE DARKNESS HAD FALLEN ON THE ROOM 
I THINK I REALISED THAT IT REALLY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN FAKE BECAUSE UM 
THE GUY TO MY LEFT NOT ONLY WAS HE SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE TORSO 
HE PUKED BECAUSE OF THE PAIN I IMAGINE 
I REMEMBER THINKING WHEN HE WAS SHOOTING EVERYBODY WHAT A COWARD 
HE THINKS HE'S DOING A NOBLE THING AND HE THINKS HE'S BEING LIKE A BIG SHOT OR SOMETHING 
BY KILLING PEOPLE BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE DEFENCELESS' 
ONLY ELEVEN MINUTES AFTER THE START OF THE RAMPAGE THE POLICE BROKE INTO NORRIS HALL 
CHO HEARD THEM ENTER PUT A PISTOL TO HIS TEMPLE AND SHOT HIMSELF 
ONE OF THE FIRST ON THE SCENE WAS SERGEANT MATTHEW BRANNOCK 
JUST THAT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE AND THE MAGNITUDE AND 
THE NATURE OF HOW THEY LOST THEIR LIFE WAS JUST OVERWHELMING 
WHEN WE ENTERED THE STAIRWELL THERE WAS ALREADY BLOOD RUNNING DOWN THE STEPS IN A CONSTANT STREAM 
WHEN WE CAME TO THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING AND THERE WERE THE TWO DECEASED PEOPLE THERE 
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE BLOOD OR WHATEVER COMING DOWN THE STEPS WAS FROM THEM 
COMING DOWN THE HALLWAY IT'S JUST ALL STREWN DOWN THE HALLWAY 
YOU KNOW THE FLOOR WAS JUST PAINTED RED 
AND AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT IT'S BREATHTAKING 
TO GO FROM ONE ROOM WHERE YOU SEE ER SEVERAL PEOPLE ERM WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES 
IN THE INCIDENT TO GO TO ANOTHER ROOM THAT'S TWICE THAT MANY PEOPLE 
YOU KNOW AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT YOU 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE STARTING TO GET A SENSE OF YOU KNOW WOW THIS IS 
THIS IS A TREMENDOUS INCIDENT 
WHAT DRIVES SOMEBODY 
WHAT STATE OF MIND GETS THEM TO A POSITION TO WHERE YOU CAN CARRY OUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
THAT MORNING SEUNG HUI CHO HAD KILLED THIRTY TWO PEOPLE AND INJURED MANY MORE 
HIS WAS THE WORST EXAMPLE YET OF THE RECENT WAVE OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS 
IN ONE WEEK ALONE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THERE WERE FOUR SUCH ATTACKS IN THE U. S. 
WHY DO MEN LIKE CHO AND IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS MEN COMMIT SUCH OUTRAGES 
THE VIRGINIA POLICE MOUNTED A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION 
BY THE END OF THE FIRST DAY WE HAD UPWARDS OF THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE THERE 
BY THE SECOND DAY WE HAD ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE THERE 
WE'VE GATHERED A TON OF EVIDENCE 
ONE FORCE ONE MISSION FOR JUSTICE FREE 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DESPERATELY SEEK IN DETERMINING 
MOTIVE AND WHY IT HAPPENED 
IS SOME IDEA ABOUT HOW WE CAN PREVENT THESE SORTS OF THINGS IN THE FUTURE 
SO HAVING SOME UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY CHO FELT THE WAY THAT HE FELT 
WOULD WOULD GO TOWARD OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO 
STOP ANY SORT OF EVENT LIKE THIS 
INITIALLY THE MEDIA CLAIMED THAT CHO'S FIRST VICTIM NINETEEN YEAR OLD EMILY HILSCHER 
WAS AN EX GIRLFRIEND THAT THIS WAS A CRIME OF PASSION 
THE POLICE HAVE SINCE DISMISSED THIS MOTIVE 
BUT THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND ANY OTHER 
WE CAN'T FIND ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN CHO AND ANY OF THE VICTIMS' 
THANKS SIR 
IT'S REALLY REALLY FRUSTRATING 
AS WE GO THROUGH OUR INVESTIGATION AND TALKING WITH FOLKS AND TRY 
TO IDENTIFY WHAT THEY KNEW ABOUT THE PEOPLE INVOLVED 
THE VICTIMS WHAT THEY KNEW ABOUT ER 
ER THE CHO THE SUBJECT THAT WE NOW KNOW ACTUALLY 
WE STILL AT THIS POINT HAVEN'T LEARNED HE MAY HAVE DONE THIS 
WAS CHO THEN INSANE 
HIS VIDEO SENT TO N. B. C. CERTAINLY SEEMED DELUSIONAL 
YOU HAVE VANDALIZED MY HEART RAPED MY SOUL AND TORCHED MY CONSCIENCE 
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ONE PATHETIC BOY'S LIFE YOU WERE EXTINGUISHING 
THANKS TO YOU I DIE LIKE JESUS CHRIST TO INSPIRE GENERATIONS OF THE WEAK AND THE DEFENCELESS PEOPLE 
ON THE DAY OF THE ATTACK HE HAD WRITTEN IN RED ON HIS ARM THE BIZARRE WORDS AX ISHMAEL 
THIS WAS ALSO THE NAME HE PUT AS THE SENDER ON THE PACKAGE TO N. B. C. 
PERHAPS CHO'S KILLING SPREE COULD BE EXPLAINED AS A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE 
BUT HIS CAREFUL PREPARATIONS WERE NOT THE SPONTANEOUS ACTIONS OF A MADMAN 
CHO PURCHASED HIS FIRST GUN 
AND COLLECTED IT FROM A PAWN BROKERS TWO AND A HALF MONTHS BEFORE THE SHOOTINGS 
FIVE WEEKS BEFORE THE SHOOTINGS HE HIRED A VAN IN WHICH HE TAPED SOME OF HIS DIATRIBE 
THEN HE WENT TO NEARBY ROANOKE TO PURCHASE A SECOND GUN A MORE POWERFUL GLOCK NINE M. M. 
HE PRACTICED SHOOTING AT SEVERAL RANGES IN THE AREA AND CONTINUED TO BUY AMMUNITION 
EIGHT DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK HE HIRED A ROOM AT A HOTEL WHERE HE RECORDED MORE OF HIS VIDEO TAPE 
SIX DAYS LATER A MAN WAS SPOTTED ACTING SUSPICIOUSLY IN NORRIS HALL 
THE DOORS WERE FOUND CHAINED SHUT 
THE POLICE THINK THIS COULD HAVE BEEN CHO CARRYING OUT A REHEARSAL 
HE MANAGED ALL THIS WITHOUT DRAWING ANY ATTENTION TO HIMSELF 
SOMEONE SUFFERING FROM PSYCHOSIS WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOUND THIS IMPOSSIBLE 
EVEN THE STUDENT WHO SHARED A ROOM WITH CHO NOTICED NOTHING ABNORMAL IN HIS BEHAVIOUR 
I HAD NO INDICATION THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS COMING 
REALLY NO INDICATION OF ANY KINDA 
LIKE CRAZY TENDENCIES AT ALL 
HE JUST SEEMED LIKE A SHY ANTISOCIAL PERSON 
IF CHO WASN'T MAD WHAT THEN DROVE HIM TO COMMIT HIS TERRIBLE CRIME 
IN THE VIDEO STATEMENT CHO SENT TO N. B. C. HE GAVE HIS REASONS 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS TO BE SPIT ON YOUR FACE AND TO HAVE TRASH SHOVED DOWN YOUR THROAT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO DIG YOUR OWN GRAVE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR THROAT SLASHED FROM EAR TO EAR 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE TORCHED ALIVE 
CHO'S JUSTIFICATION FOR MASS MURDER SEEMED TO BE THE INNUMERABLE HURTS THAT HE'D SUFFERED 
BUT NO ONE EVER WITNESSED CHO BEING PERSECUTED 
I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF EVER SEEING ANYONE LIKE 
ATTACK HIM IN EITHER LIKE VERBALLY OR PHYSICAL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
IN THE YEAR I LIVED WITH HIM AND AFTER I LIVED WITH HIM 
WHEN I SAW HIM I NEVER SAW HIM PICKED ON 
NOBODY EVER BULLIED HIM PUSHED HIM AROUND 
YOU HAD EVERYTHING YOU WANTED 
YOUR MERCEDES WASN'T ENOUGH YOU BRATS 
YOUR GOLDEN NECKLACES WEREN'T ENOUGH YOU SNOBS 
YOUR TRUST FUND WASN'T ENOUGH 
YOUR VODKA AND COGNAC WEREN'T ENOUGH ALL YOUR DEBAUCHERIES WEREN'T ENOUGH 
CHO CLAIMED TO BE PUNISHING A DECADENT AND CORRUPT COMMUNITY 
BUT VIRGINIA TECH IS NO RICH KID'S PLAYGROUND 
IT'S A STATE FUNDED INSTITUTION WHERE CANDIDATES GET IN ON MERIT 
VIRGINIA TECH'S A NORMAL SCHOOL THERE'S NOT 
WE'RE NOT ALL DRIVING MERCEDES AND EVERYBODY'S NORMAL HERE AND THERE'S NO 
LIKE PEOPLE WE'RE NOT RUNNING AROUND YOU KNOW AND 
HARDLY ANY CLOTHES AND JUST DRINKING ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW 
IT'S SAID THAT THE CHILD IS FATHER TO THE MAN 
SO IF CHO WASN'T BEING BULLIED BY RICH COLLEGE KIDS CAN WE TRACE THE 
ORIGINS OF HIS BITTERNESS BACK TO HURTS HE SUFFERED IN HIS CHILDHOOD 
THIS IS CENTREVILLE 
A WELL TO DO COMMUTER SUBURB OF WASHINGTON D. C. 
IT IS HOME TO A SIZEABLE KOREAN POPULATION 
CHO'S FAMILY IS OF KOREAN ORIGIN 
WHEN HE WAS EIGHT HE HAD COME TO THE U. S. WITH HIS PARENTS AND ELDER SISTER 
HIS FAMILY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WEALTHY BUT THEY OWNED A FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSE 
NOT WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FROM SOME OF THE COMMENTS IN CHO'S VIDEO 
CHO WAS NO PRODUCT OF THE SLUM OR GHETTO 
BUT FURTHER CLUES ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD ARE HARD TO UNCOVER 
UNDERSTANDABLY CHO'S FAMILY HAVE KEPT A LOW PROFILE SINCE THE ATTACK 
PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE 
EITHER YOU'RE GOOD EITHER YOU'RE BAD 
SUSAN COLIHAN WAS A FAMILY ACQUAINTANCE WHO USED TO CUT CHO'S HAIR 
WELL HE NEVER SPEAK 
SO I ASK HIM WHAT KIND OF HAIR CUT YOU LIKE HE NEVER ANSWER 
SO THEN DAD SAY WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER 
LADY ASK YOU HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR HAIR CUT 
AND THEN HE STILL DON'T ANSWER HE JUST LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT 
ALL THE TIME FOR TWO YEARS 
YEAH HARDLY SPEAK ANY 
I ASK HIS MUM YOU KNOW I SAY DID HE TALK ANY 
SHE SAY YES 
WHEN ER 
SISTER'S ROUND 
AND THEY TALK 
HE DON'T SPEAK IT DON'T MEAN HE'S BAD BECAUSE HE DON'T SPEAK 
CHILDREN CAN BE CRUEL 
PERHAPS THEN THIS QUIET KOREAN BOY WAS PICKED ON AT SCHOOL 
THIS IS SEUNG HUI CHO'S HIGH SCHOOL 
IT'S A LARGE INSTITUTION WITH THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS 
IT IS IN THE TOP FIFTY HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE WHOLE OF AMERICA 
AND HAS THE PROUD MOTTO UNITED IN EXCELLENCE COMMITTED TO ACHIEVEMENT 
CHO'S RESERVE MADE A LASTING IMPRESSION ON HIS CLASSMATES 
I ALWAYS SAW HIM WALK IN THE HALL BY HIMSELF 
MY MEMORIES OF HIM ARE BEING ALONE BEING ISOLATED 
MORE IMPORTANTLY BEING PRETTY INVISIBLE 
I THINK A PERSON THAT NO ONE REALLY NOTICED 
CHO SAT IMMEDIATELY NEXT TO ME 
I REMEMBER HE WAS REALLY REALLY QUIET 
WE USED TO TRY TO LIKE O. K. LET'S TRY TO GET HIM TO INTERACT 
AND SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS WEEKEND YOU GOING TO THE MOVIES 
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND LIKE JUST ASKING ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE WOULD ASK ANY OTHER HIGH SCHOOL GUY 
HE WOULD COMMUNICATE WITH US EITHER WITH A HEAD NOD OR 
I DESCRIBED IT AS A GRUNT 
IN THE END HE DID SAY A FEW WORDS TO ME REALLY QUIET KIND OF DRAWN OUT 
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO SEE HIM AS A BAD GUY 
I THINK HE WAS A VERY LONELY GUY 
HE WAS A GOOD GUY AT LEAST FOR AS LONG I KNEW HIM 
CHO MAY HAVE BEEN SOLITARY BUT JUST AS AT UNIVERSITY 
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS PERSECUTED 
I NEVER SAW HIM BEING BULLIED OR PERSECUTED ANYBODY YOU KNOW DOING ANYTHING 
AT NO POINT DID I WITNESS ANY TYPE OF PERSECUTION OF SEUNG 
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM BEING BEAT UP OR I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY WITNESSED HIM BEING VERBALLY ATTACKED 
BUT CHO'S SCHOOL WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HIS WITHDRAWN BEHAVIOUR 
THEY TOLD HIS PARENTS THAT HE NEEDED THERAPY 
SO AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN HE WAS TAKEN TO THE CENTER FOR MULTICULTURAL HUMAN SERVICES 
IT'S A CHARITY THAT OFFERS HELP TO ETHNIC MINORITIES 
CHO WENT THERE FOR FOUR YEARS 
DOCTOR JAMES GRIFFITH WAS HIS SUPERVISORY COUNSELLOR 
I THINK THE THING THAT WAS MOST NOTABLE 
THAT I ALWAYS HAVE REMEMBERED WAS THE PAIN OF HIS SHYNESS 
NO EYE CONTACT ONLY NODDING 
HE WOULD BREAK OUT IN A SWEAT HE WOULD SEEM TO REALLY FREEZE 
HE REALLY WAS UNABLE TO RESPOND 
REALLY A PALPABLE PAIN 
WITH HIS ANXIETY WHEN ANY QUESTION WAS PUT TO HIM 
CHO'S INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WAS SO SEVERE THAT HE WAS GIVEN ART THERAPY 
THIS IS USUALLY USED FOR MUCH YOUNGER CHILDREN 
BUT IT MEANT HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SPEAK 
IT CERTAINLY PROVIDED ONE POINT OF HUMAN CONTACT ONE PERSON THAT HE COULD BE WITH WITH SOME EASE 
WITHOUT HIGH DEMANDS THAT COULD BE RESPONDING TO HIM 
EVERY WEEK AT LEAST FOR THAT HOUR 
BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT REVEALED ANOTHER ASPECT OF CHO'S PERSONALITY 
AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN 
HE DISPLAYED A DISTURBING NEW INTEREST 
SHORTLY AFTER THE COLUMBINE SHOOTINGS HE WROTE AN ESSAY AT SCHOOL THAT ALARMED HIS TEACHERS 
THERE WAS NO THREAT AGAINST ANYONE 
BUT HE DID TALK ABOUT IDENTIFYING WITH THEM 
CHO WAS IDENTIFYING WITH ERIC HARRIS AND DYLAN KLEBOLD 
THE HIGH SCHOOL KILLERS WHO HAD MASSACRED THIRTEEN BEFORE SHOOTING THEMSELVES 
THIS FASCINATION WITH COLUMBINE WOULD STAY WITH CHO 
IN THE PACKAGE HE SENT TO N. B. C. ON THE DAY OF HIS KILLINGS HE INCLUDED A LETTER 
ACCORDING TO THE BROADCASTER IT EXPRESSES ADMIRATION FOR MARTYRS LIKE ERIC AND DYLAN 
HIS THERAPIST DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED A PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION 
SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT HE WAS DEPRESSED THAT HE MIGHT BE HAVING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS 
SO WE DID A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION AND 
A DIAGNOSIS OF SELECTED MUTISM AND POSSIBLE MAJOR DEPRESSION WERE MADE 
SELECTIVE MUTISM SUFFERERS CAN SPEAK BUT HAVE SUCH 
SEVERE SOCIAL ANXIETY THAT THEY WITHDRAW IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AND WILL NOT COMMUNICATE 
CHILDREN WITH SELECTIVE MUTISM HAVE DIFFICULTY SOCIALLY EMOTIONALLY AND POSSIBLY ACADEMICALLY 
WHEN THESE CHILDREN ARE LEFT UNTREATED 
THIS AFFECTS THEIR SELF ESTEEM SELF WORTH 
THEY OFTEN ARE VERY LONELY INDIVIDUALS THEY CAN BE VERY SAD AT TIMES 
MANY INDIVIDUALS FEEL VERY FRUSTRATED OVER THE LONELINESS 
OVER THEIR INABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
IF YOU PUSH AIR THROUGH THE TEETH THAT'S A SSSS 
SSSS VERY GOOD 
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THERE'S NO LINK BETWEEN SELECTIVE MUTISM AND VIOLENCE 
AND WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH CHO WAS A VERY COMPLEX SITUATION 
BY THE TIME CHO'S CONDITION WAS DIAGNOSED HE WAS A PROFOUNDLY DAMAGED YOUNG MAN 
SAVE FOR OCCASIONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS SISTER CHO HAD HARDLY SPOKEN IN HIS LIFE 
WHY THEN HAD HIS PARENTS NOT SOUGHT TREATMENT SOONER 
CERTAINLY ROOM MATE ANDY KOCH WAS STRUCK BY 
WHAT HE FELT WAS A COLDNESS BETWEEN CHO AND HIS PARENTS 
IT WASN'T TYPICAL FAMILY INTERACTION 
THEY JUST DROPPED HIM OFF WAVED GOODBYE AND THAT WAS IT 
NO HUGS NO CALL US 
WE'LL CALL WHEN WE GET HOME 
OR ANY OF THOSE NORMAL 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE BE THAT FAR AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY 
PERHAPS THERE ARE CLUES IN SOUTH KOREA WHERE CHO WAS BORN AND LIVED TILL HE WAS EIGHT 
THIS HUMBLE GROUND FLOOR FLAT IN SEOUL WAS HOME TO CHO HIS ELDER SISTER AND HIS PARENTS 
SOME OF CHO'S FAMILY STILL LIVE NEARBY 
SOUTH KOREANS WORK SOME OF THE LONGEST HOURS IN THE WORLD 
WHEN THE FAMILY MOVED TO AMERICA THEY TOOK THE HABIT WITH THEM 
BOTH PARENTS WERE EMPLOYED IN THE DRY CLEANING BUSINESS OFTEN WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK 
AS PART OF THE OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE SHOOTING 
DOCTOR ROGER DEPUE WAS ASKED TO INTERVIEW CHO'S FAMILY 
HE'S ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING CRIMINAL PROFILERS 
IF THERE WAS ANY CRITICISM THAT I COULD MAKE IT WOULD BE THAT 
PERHAPS THEY WERE NOT HOME ENOUGH BOTH OF THEM WORKING LONG HOURS 
THERE MAY BE CONSEQUENCES TO PAY IF YOU'RE 
NOT HOME ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A CHILD THAT HAS SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS 
CHO MAY HAVE SUFFERED FROM LACK OF ATTENTION BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING ELSE 
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE WERE ANY MORE TENSIONS IN THE FAMILY 
BEYOND WHAT THE YOUNG MAN BROUGHT INTO THE EQUATION 
DOCTOR BELA SOOD ALSO INTERVIEWED CHO'S FAMILY 
SHE'S AN EMINENT CHILD PSYCHIATRIST 
OH SO STILL A LONG WHILE 
IN TALKING WITH SEUNG HUI CHO'S SISTER SUN 
AND THE PARENTS 
IT BECAME VERY APPARENT TO ME THAT THEY WERE A VERY CARING AND 
CONCERNED FAMILY 
THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE FATHER DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS BEING 
AN INTROVERT THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE AND SO HE REALLY SAW SEUNG HUI AS VERY SIMILAR TO HIM 
THE FATHER GREW UP TO BE FINE AND SO THEY JUST THOUGHT THAT THE SON WOULD ALSO GROW UP TO BE WELL 
EVEN AFTER CHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SELECTIVE MUTISM HE NEVER GOT THE SPECIALIST TREATMENT HE REQUIRED 
I THINK HIS SELECTIVE MUTISM WOULD HAVE WOULD HAVE 
BENEFITED MOST IF IT HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED AND TREATED VERY EARLY 
YOU KNOW EARLY CHILDHOOD 
YOU KNOW BY AGE THIRTEEN WHEN HE CAME 
THERE ARE MANY DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES MANY YEARS OF CHILDHOOD IN WHICH 
THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE THAT IT'S NOT ONLY 
A BRAIN ANXIETY DISORDER BUT IT'S ALSO A LIFESTYLE AND A 
WHOLE LIFE THAT HAS BEEN ORGANISED AROUND IT AND VERY HARD TO CHANGE 
ALTHOUGH DOCTOR GRIFFITH DIDN'T HAVE THE SPECIALIST RESOURCES 
TO TREAT CHO'S SELECTIVE MUTISM HE CONTINUED CHO'S COUNSELLING AND PUT HIM ON ANTI DEPRESSANTS 
SLOWLY CHO'S DEPRESSION LIFTED 
THEN HE ASKED TO STOP ALL TREATMENT 
HIS PARENTS WERE KIND OF IN AGREEMENT HE WASN'T HAVING SYMPTOMS 
THERE WAS NOT A COMPELLING REASON TO PRESS THAT HE CONTINUE ON IT 
THE TASK OF ADOLESCENCE IS INDEPENDENCE AUTONOMY RESPONSIBILITY 
AND SAYING TO YOUR PARENTS I'M READY TO TAKE ON MY OWN LIFE 
IS WHAT KIDS MOSTLY DO 
ALTHOUGH CHO WAS SILENT AND ISOLATED HIS INTERESTS WERE THOSE OF A NORMAL ADOLESCENT 
FOR A HIGH SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT HE WROTE 
I LIKE TO LISTEN TO TALK SHOWS AND ALTERNATIVE STATIONS 
AND I LIKE ACTION MOVIES 
MY FAVOURITE MOVIE IS X. MEN FAVOURITE ACTOR IS NICOLAS CAGE FAVOURITE BAND IS U. TWO 
A YEAR LATER IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
CHO GOT INTO VIRGINIA TECH ONE HUNDRED SIXTY MILES FROM HOME 
HE WAS GOING TO STUDY BUSINESS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
HE WAS VERY EXCITED 
HE WAS THE ONE WHO WROTE HIS APPLICATIONS UP 
HE RECEIVED NO HELP FOR THAT AND SO WAS VERY SELF DIRECTED 
THE PARENTS WERE ACTUALLY HAPPY FOR HIM 
THAT HE WAS TAKING THE INITIATIVE AND SUN HIS SISTER ACTUALLY SAID 
THAT THEY WERE VERY SURPRISED WITH HOW DETERMINED HE WAS AND THAT HE MADE IT HAPPEN FOR HIMSELF 
CHO'S MEDICATION COUNSELLING AND THE SUPPORT OF HIS FAMILY AND SCHOOL HAD GIVEN HIM A NEW CONFIDENCE 
EVEN THOUGH HE STILL HAD SELECTIVE MUTISM 
SO HOW THEN COULD THIS QUIET SELF CONTAINED YOUNG MAN 
HAVE BECOME SOMEONE EVEN HIS FAMILY SAID THEY DIDN'T RECOGNISE 
YOU HAD A HUNDRED BILLION CHANCES AND WAYS TO HAVE AVOIDED TODAY BUT YOU DECIDED TO SPILL MY BLOOD 
YOU FORCED ME INTO A CORNER AND GAVE ME ONLY ONE OPTION THE DECISION WAS YOURS 
NOW YOU HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS THAT WILL NEVER WASH OFF 
IT WAS DURING HIS THREE AND A HALF YEARS AT UNIVERSITY THAT THIS SHY YOUNG MAN 
TURNED INTO A MURDERER 
EVEN BY AMERICAN STANDARDS VIRGINIA TECH IS A BIG UNIVERSITY 
IT HAS SOME THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES SPREAD OVER A VAST TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED ACRES 
IT'S ALMOST A TOWN IN ITS OWN RIGHT WITH ITS OWN AIRPORT AND A SPORTS STADIUM THAT HOLDS SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE 
FOR CHO 
IT WAS AN EASY PLACE TO GET LOST 
THE SCHOOL WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS CHOICE OF VIRGINIA TECH BECAUSE THEY FELT IT WAS A VERY LARGE SCHOOL 
AND THAT HE REALLY REQUIRED SUPPORT SERVICES 
CHO'S HIGH SCHOOL KNEW ABOUT HIS SELECTIVE MUTISM HIS DEPRESSION AND HIS FANTASIES ABOUT COLUMBINE 
YET THEY COULDN'T PASS THE INFORMATION ON TO VIRGINIA TECH 
DISCLOSURE OF ANY DISABILITY IS CONSIDERED A PRIVATE MATTER 
AND NEITHER CHO NOR HIS PARENTS CHOSE TO OFFER IT 
CHO'S FIRST YEAR STUDYING BUSINESS PASSED SMOOTHLY ENOUGH 
HE HANDED IN HIS WORK LIKE OTHER STUDENTS AND HIS GRADES WERE GOOD 
HE BLENDED IN QUIETLY 
THEN CHO'S AMBITIONS TOOK AN UNEXPECTED TURN 
AT HOME FOR THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS HE FELT INSPIRED TO WRITE A NOVEL 
A WORK OF ROMANTIC FICTION 
HIS PARENTS AND SISTER SUN WERE ENTHUSIASTIC 
WHAT SUN SAYS IS THAT UM 
THEY WERE ACTUALLY QUITE UM HAPPY FOR HIM 
AND THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT IT AS A POSSIBLE CAREER FOR HIMSELF 
BACK AT VIRGINIA TECH CHO PURSUED HIS NEW VOCATION 
HE WROTE TO THEN HEAD OF ENGLISH BRITISH POET LUCINDA ROY 
HE'D TAKEN HER INTRODUCTION TO POETRY COURSE THE PREVIOUS YEAR 
WHEN HE ENQUIRED ABOUT HIS NOVEL IN THE FIRST INSTANCE 
I REALLY DID TRY TO DISCOURAGE HIM 
FROM LAUNCHING INTO A CAREER TOO QUICKLY BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE'D BE REJECTED 
THE NOVEL WAS A ROMANCE IN A WAY ABOUT SOMEONE SEEKING LOVE AND REDEMPTION REALLY 
BUT YOU KNOW HE WAS NOT A GREAT WRITER AND HE DIDN'T HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF INSIGHT 
SO IT WAS MORE LIKE A KIND OF TEENAGE ANGST THING 
I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHY IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT 
TAKING MANY CLASSES OVER MANY YEARS AND HONING YOUR CRAFT 
EARLY IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
CHO DECIDED TO HONE HIS CRAFT AND SWITCHED HIS COURSE TO ENGLISH 
HE'D NOT BEEN GOOD AT ENGLISH AT SCHOOL BEING MORE SUITED TO MATHS 
BUT CHO HAD DISCOVERED THE JOYS OF SELF EXPRESSION 
DOCTOR ROGER DEPUE HAS STUDIED CHO'S WRITINGS CLOSELY 
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T TAKE SOCIAL SKILLS AND INTERACTION AND ALL OF THAT 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD DO SOLITARILY YOU KNOW 
YOU COULD DO THIS BY YOURSELF 
AND JUST LET YOUR FANTASY OUT AND ON THE PAGES 
AND PEOPLE WOULD BE AMAZED AND ASTOUNDED BY WHAT YOU PRODUCED 
WELL IT DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY YOU KNOW 
CHO'S EFFORTS WERE NOT A LITERARY SENSATION 
HIS GRADES WERE POOR AND THEN LATER THAT YEAR 
A PUBLISHER REJECTED HIS PROPOSAL FOR A NOVEL 
HE GET'S LESS THAN THE LEVEL OF PRAISE 
OR THE LEVEL OF ACCEPTANCE THAT HE HAD HOPED FOR 
INSTEAD HE GETS CRITICISM AND EVEN SOME BAD GRADES 
HE CAN'T BRING IT OFF YOU KNOW AND WHEN HIS SISTER SUN SAYS 
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE BOOKS REJECTED AND MAYBE I COULD HELP YOU MAYBE I COULD EDIT IT MAYBE 
AND HE WOULDN'T ALLOW HER TO READ THE BOOK 
HIS SISTER WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT YOUNG WOMAN 
A GRADUATE FROM PRINCETON UNIVERSITY 
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME KIND OF SIBLING RIVALRY YOU KNOW 
CHO'S FRAGILE BUBBLE OF SELF DELUSION WAS POPPED 
AS TWO THOUSAND FIVE ENDED HIS BEHAVIOUR BECAME INCREASINGLY ODD 
EVEN DEFIANT 
IN MY BRITISH LITERATURE CLASS 
HE SAT IN THE BACK CORNER AND HE DIDN'T INTRODUCE HIMSELF 
AS ANYTHING BUT QUESTION MARK 
AND OF ALL THE QUESTIONS THE TEACHER PROMPTED HIM 
WHEN SHE ASKED HIM TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE HE ANSWERED 
AT FIRST CHO JUST SEEMED SHY TO US BUT ONCE HE REALLY WENT OUT OF HIS WAY 
TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY COULD INTERACT WITH HIM IT DID COME OFF AS ARROGANT 
WHEN HE CAME INTO THE CLASS HE WOULD KEEP HIS HEAD DOWN AND WALK STRAIGHT TO HIS SEAT 
HE WOULD JUST SIT BACK THERE AND DO NOTHING I TRIED TO SAY HI TO HIM ONCE 
HE DIDN'T RESPOND AND IF ANYBODY ELSE SAID ANYTHING TO HIM HE DIDN'T RESPOND TO THEM EITHER 
AND WHEN THE CLASS WAS OVER HE WOULD LEAVE WITHOUT RUNNING INTO ANYBODY 
TALKING TO THE PROFESSOR OR ANYTHING 
HE'S THE MOST ANTI SOCIAL PERSON THAT I'VE EVER MET 
PROFESSOR GIOVANNI GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME 
I BELIEVE BY E. MAIL AND ALSO VERBALLY 
TO LET ME KNOW THAT SHE DIDN'T WISH TO TEACH THIS STUDENT THAT SHE HAD 
IN HER CLASS ANY MORE SHE WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HIM 
AND THAT HE'D BEEN RUDE SHE FELT 
AND THAT SOMETHING THAT HE'D WRITTEN SEEMED DISTURBING TO HER 
SO I WROTE TO HIM AND I RECOGNISED THE NAME 
AND I REALISED I'D HAD HIM BEFORE 
HE WALKED IN AND HE HAD A CAP 
THAT WAS PULLED DOWN VERY LOW OVER HIS EYES AND SUNGLASSES ON 
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT 
HOW HE WANTED TO ESCAPE ATTENTION BUT I THINK THAT 
HE REALLY WANTED TO BE NOTICED IN A WAY THAT TO ME WAS DISTURBING 
LUCINDA ROY TOLD CHO THAT HE'D BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CLASS 
AND THAT SHE WOULD TEACH HIM HERSELF 
THEN HE LEFT THE ROOM BUT HE WAS SO SAD IT SEEMED TO ME 
THAT I RAN AFTER HIM AND GAVE HIM A COPY OF ONE OF MY BOOKS AND JUST SAID 
HERE THIS IS FOR YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO READ THAT 
AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WAS CRYING 
THE TWO OF THEM MET SEVERAL TIMES 
ALTHOUGH THESE WERE TUTORIALS DOCTOR ROY ENCOURAGED HIM TO GO TO COUNSELLING 
AND TRIED HARD TO UNDERSTAND HIM 
I WOULD ASK HIM A QUESTION AND HE WOULD TAKE BETWEEN TEN TO TWENTY SECONDS TO RESPOND 
WHEN YOU'RE WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO RESPOND IT IS A VERY VERY LONG TIME 
AND THEN WHEN HE WOULD RESPOND IT WOULD BE IN A WHISPER A VOICE THAT WAS 
RATHER LIKE THIS THAT YOU COULD HARDLY HEAR 
AND HE WOULD ALWAYS SPEAK LIKE THAT 
I DID ASK HIM WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS DEPRESSED AND HE DID SAY THAT HE WAS 
AND I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WAS LONELY AND HE DID SAY THAT HE WAS 
AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD NO FRIENDS AND THAT THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT 
BUT AS WE GOT TALKING HE SEEMED TO BE 
PRETTY RELAXED WITH ME IN MANY WAYS AND WE WOULD TALK ABOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS 
IT SEEMS TO ME IRONIC THAT THE CONDITION THAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE SUFFERED FROM 
I'VE NOW LEARNED IS SELECTIVE MUTISM BECAUSE IT DID SEEM VERY SELECTIVE TO ME 
IN THE SENSE THAT HE CHOSE WHEN HE WOULD SPEAK AND HE COULD SPEAK 
VERY ELOQUENTLY IF HE WANTED TO BUT HE COULD ALSO BE VERY SILENT WHEN HE WANTED TO 
AND HE SEEMED TO USE THAT SILENCE IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS HE USED HIS SUNGLASSES AND HIS HAT 
BOTH AS A WAY OF HIDING BEHIND THIS PERSONA HE'D BUILT 
THIS MASK HE'D BUILT BUT ALSO AS A WAY OF INTIMIDATION 
OF MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNEW THAT THERE WERE THINGS ABOUT HIM YOU COULDN'T KNOW 
THERE'S ALWAYS A VERY DANGEROUS COMBINATION WITH YOUNG WRITERS 
WHERE THEY ARE BOTH VERY VERY INSECURE AND INCREDIBLY ARROGANT 
HE SEEMED TO HAVE BOTH OF THOSE THINGS 
ANDY KOCH WAS ONE OF CHO'S DORM MATES THAT YEAR 
HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO BEFRIEND HIM 
I'D TALK TO HIM A LOT BUT YOU'D NEVER GET ANYTHING BACK AND THAT WOULD BE QUITE FRUSTRATING 
BUT FINALLY ONE FRIDAY WE ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED TO GO TO A FRAT PARTY WITH US 
HE AGREED AND FROM WHAT I COULD TELL IT WAS HIS FIRST TIME BEING AROUND THAT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT 
AS THE NIGHT WENT ON HE DRANK MORE AND GOT A LITTLE MORE OPEN WITH US 
TOLD US ABOUT HIS IMAGINARY GIRLFRIEND 
AND HE CALLED HER HIS IMAGINARY GIRLFRIEND 
SHE CALLED HIM SPANKY 
AND HE CALLED HER JELLY 
WE WENT BACK TO A FRIEND OF MINE'S DORM 
AND SEUNG KIND OF GOES WITHOUT PROMPTING YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING COOL 
AND THAT WAS REALLY UNUSUAL FOR HIM TO INITIATE CONVERSATION 
AND HE PULLED OUT A KNIFE AND JUST STARTED STABBING THE CARPET KIND OF SLOW AND DELIBERATE 
I GUESS HE WAS TRYING TO GRAB ATTENTION 
CHO WAS NOW ASSUMING A RANGE OF PERSONALITIES 
INCLUDING THAT OF QUESTION MARK 
THE PSEUDONYM HE'D USED IN HIS ENGLISH CLASS 
QUESTION MARK HE SAID WAS HIS BROTHER 
AND THERE WAS A FACEBOOK PROFILE TO GO ALONG WITH THIS 
HE WAS REALLY OBSESSED WITH BEING COOL ON THIS PROFILE 
HE PUT THIS PICTURE OF THIS WEIRD FIGURE AND A QUESTION MARK BLOCKING THE FACE 
SAID HE LIVED ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF COCHRANE WHICH WASN'T POSSIBLE 
THERE WAS ONLY FIVE FLOORS AND HE WAS IN ROOM SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
AND HE'S GOT THIS GIRLFRIEND THAT LIVES IN OUTER SPACE AND TRAVELS ON A SPACESHIP 
AS CHO BEGAN TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IN ANDY KOCH'S COMPANY 
HE STARTED TO RING HIS NEW FOUND BUDDY 
I GUESS HE BUILT A RAPPORT WITH ME WHEN HE CALLED ME HE WOULD EITHER SAY THIS IS QUESTION MARK 
OR THIS IS SEUNG HE WOULD MAKE SURE YOU KNEW AND IF HE SAID THIS IS QUESTION MARK 
YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF PLAY ALONG BUT EVENTUALLY YOU GET TIRED OF IT AND GO I KNOW THIS IS YOU SEUNG 
AND HE'S LIKE NO THIS IS QUESTION MARK SEUNG'S BROTHER 
HE WAS VERY ADAMANT ABOUT IT BEING HIS BROTHER 
ADOPTING DIFFERENT PERSONAS IS VERY COMMON 
WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T FEEL VERY CENTRED 
AND DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE 
THESE TALKS ABOUT HAVING A TWIN BROTHER OR HIM BEING A QUESTION MARK 
REFLECTING THE AMBIVALENCE THAT HE PROBABLY FELT ABOUT HIMSELF 
AND THE TWIN BROTHER PROBABLY A REFLECTION OF MORE THE IDEAL SELF THAT HE WANTED TO BE 
CHO ALSO STARTED TO INDULGE IN GAMES OF A MORE VOYEURISTIC NATURE 
HE SAT DOWN WITH US AND THERE WAS A GROUP OF GIRLS NEXT TO US 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SEE A FLASH 
AND HE'D TAKEN A PICTURE AND THESE GIRLS ARE ALL LOOKING AT US KINDA ANNOYED 
LATER ON THAT PROGRESSED INTO HIM TAKING PICTURES OF PEOPLE I KNOW 
FINALLY ONE DAY I WAS IN MY ROOM AND I SEE A FLASH AND I TURN AROUND 
AND SURE ENOUGH SEUNG'S THERE TAKING A PICTURE 
SO I DECIDED THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF HIS GAMES THAT I WAS GONNA PUT A STOP TO 
WENT UP TO HIM AND TOOK A PICTURE OF HIM AND HE WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT 
HE KEPT WANTING TO SEE THAT PICTURE HE HAD TO SEE THAT PICTURE 
SO I FINALLY DELETED IT AND THAT ENDED THAT AND HE WAS HAPPY 
CHO'S SELECTIVE MUTISM WAS SUBTLY TRANSFORMING 
HE WAS NO LONGER AS SHY AS HE ONCE WAS 
THERE'S MANY INDIVIDUALS AS THEY GET OLDER THAT HAVE SELECTIVE MUTISM 
THE SOCIAL ANXIETY STARTS TO GO AWAY 
BUT THEIR CONDITIONED AND REINFORCED MUTE BEHAVIOUR PERSISTS 
INDIVIDUALS LEARN TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF A WORLD 
AND THAT'S HOW PEOPLE SEE THEM AND THAT'S HOW THEY SEE THEMSELVES 
CHO WAS SHOWING A NEW BOLDNESS BUT HIS PERSONALITY WAS SO DISTORTED 
THAT ANY ATTEMPTS TO SOCIALISE BACKFI RE D. 
THERE WAS ONE OCCASION HE WENT TO A GIRL'S ROOM 
HE WAS WEARING SUNGLASSES AND A HAT AND HE GOES DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM 
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM AND SHE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T 
SHE BECAME VERY FRIGHTENED SHE THREATENED TO CALL THE POLICE WHICH SHE DID 
LATER ON THAT NIGHT AROUND TWELVE OR ONE O'CLOCK I HEAR POUNDING ON MY DOOR 
VIRGINIAN TECH POLICE OPEN UP 
AND THEY ASKED WHERE QUESTION MARK WAS 
THE POLICE SPOKE TO SEUNG HUI CHO FOR HALF AN HOUR AND LEFT HIM 
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY UPSET WITH THIS GIRL 
HE TOLD ME HE WANTED TO GO LOOK IN THIS GIRL'S EYES 
AND SEE IF SHE WAS COOL AND ALL HE SAW WAS PROMISCUITY 
AND HE TALKED ABOUT HER BEING A WHORE AND STUFF 
BUT THIS INCIDENT DIDN'T STOP CHO MAKING UNWANTED APPROACHES TO ANOTHER GIRL 
SHE ALSO CALLED IN THE POLICE AND AGAIN THEY CAUTIONED HIM 
CHO CONTACTED ANDY KOCH 
HE'S LIKE ALL UPSET AND HE GOES I MIGHT AS WELL KILL MYSELF NOW 
HE OBVIOUSLY WAS A LONER AND DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO LIVE FOR SADLY 
MAYBE HE WOULD TRY AND PULL SOMETHING SO 
WE DECIDED TO REPORT IT AND THE POLICE CAME AND TOOK HIM AWAY 
CHO WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY 
HE UNDERWENT A COMMITMENT HEARING THAT FOUND HIM A DANGER TO HIMSELF 
HE WAS DETAINED OVERNIGHT AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL 
AFTER A FIFTEEN MINUTE EXAMINATION IN WHICH HE DENIED ANY SUICIDAL OR HOMICIDAL THOUGHTS 
HE WAS RELEASED WITH A COURT ORDER THAT HE OBTAIN TREATMENT AS AN OUT PATIENT 
BUT CHO NEVER COMPLIED WITH THE ORDER 
AND NO ONE FOLLOWED UP TO CHECK 
AFTER THAT CHO NO LONGER CONFIDED IN ANDY KOCH 
AND BECAME INCREASINGLY ISOLATED 
A POEM HE WROTE REVEALS HIS STATE OF MIND 
THIS THING MY LIFE 
ALL AN AGONY OF HELL OF TORTURE 
AND YEARS OF BLUDGEONING TORMENT AND TINY NUISANCES 
THE DISGUST EYES DIRTY FROWNS AND RED FINGERS POINTING AT ME 
FEELING ALL THE PATHETICNESS AND HUMILIATION 
GOOD CHRIST RIP ME APART 
TEAR ME TO SHRIVELS EAT ME TO HELP ME SEE A BETTER DAY 
AND SALVAGE THIS DECAYING THING FROM MYSELF 
BUT IF CHO'S WRITINGS EXPRESS SELF LOATHING THEY ALSO REVEAL GREAT ANGER 
WHEN A PERSON WRITES THINGS 
ESPECIALLY IF THEY REFLECT THE FANTASIES THAT HE HAS 
IT GIVES US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HIS MINDSET 
AND HIS THOUGHT PROCESSES 
I HAVE A COUPLE HERE 
THAT I THINK ARE OF VALUE AND INTERESTING 
ONE IS CALLED MR. BROWNSTONE IT'S A PLAY 
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT IN USING THE FAKE I. D. 
IN THIS PLAY THE HERO JOHN 
AND HIS TWO TEENAGE FRIENDS ILLEGALLY GET INTO A CASINO 
TOGETHER THEY BEMOAN THEIR LOT 
AFTER A LONG DAY AT SCHOOL YOU JUST WANNA BE LEFT ALONE 
THERE IS NO SAFE PLACE FOR US TO HANG OUT 
WE CAN'T HANG OUT IN FRONT OF THE GROCERY STORE 
OR THE PARK WE CAN'T HANG OUT IN THE STREET 
THE ONLY PLACE WHERE WE'RE SAFE FROM THAT HIM 
IS BEHIND THE SHITTY DUMPSTER 
MR. BROWNSTONE I'D LIKE TO KILL HIM 
IN MANY OF HIS WRITINGS THERE ARE OTHER PEERS THAT ARE WITH HIM 
I THINK THAT SHOWS THE TREMENDOUS DESIRE THAT HE HAS TO FIT IN 
THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FRIENDS' 
AREN'T YOU GUYS A LITTLE TOO YOUNG TO BE HERE 
AND EVEN IF HE HAS TO SUFFER 
HE WOULD LIKE TO SUFFER WITH HIS FRIENDS' 
IS IT ME OR DO YOU SMELL EVIL IN HERE 
NOT JUST EVIL BUT OLD TOO 
I WON YOU WON 
OH WE WON 
WE'RE RICH NO MORE MR. BROWNSTONE 
WHEN THEY WIN A FORTUNE AT THE SLOT MACHINE 
THEIR TEACHER MR. BROWNSTONE WHO'S FOUND THEM IN THE CASINO 
PRETENDS THE WINNINGS ARE HIS 
THIS IS MINE MINE 
THESE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KIDS PUSHED ME OVER WHEN THEY SAW THAT I WON 
THESE DISRESPECTFUL HOOLIGANS 
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS A PRETTY GOOD BLUEPRINT 
OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHO'S MIND 
THAT THIS IS WHAT HE'S UP AGAINST IN SOCIETY 
THAT THESE ARE THE INJUSTICES AND THAT HE CAN'T WIN 
THAT IT'S HOPELESS AND THAT EVEN IF HE WINS 
SOMEBODY TAKES IT AWAY 
AND SO THERE'S A GREAT NEED AT THE END OF THIS 
THERE'S A GREAT DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE 
NOW COME ON SON 
GIVE ME A CHANCE 
IN RICHARD MCBEEF ANOTHER OF CHO'S PLAYS 
THE HERO IS ONCE AGAIN A TEENAGER NAMED JOHN 
HE TOO IS OPPRESSED THIS TIME BY HIS STEPFATHER 
WHO'S TRYING TO SEDUCE HIM 
JOHN'S RESPONSE IS FORCEFUL 
NO DICK YOU SHUT THE HELL UP AND LISTEN TO ME 
YOU'D BETTER WATCH YOUR 
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO STICK IT UP YOUR ASS HUH 
NOW THAT'S ENOUGH 
CHO COULD NEVER DO THIS 
HE WAS NEVER ABLE TO 
ACCORDING TO HIS PARENTS AND HIS TEACHERS 
HE WAS NEVER ABLE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF A STRONG RESPONSE 
MUST KILL DICK 
MUST KILL DICK 
YOU DON'T THINK I CAN KILL YOU 
GOTCHA GOT ONE EYE GOT THE OTHER EYE 
AND IT SAYS TOWARD THE END OF THIS FANTASY 
DICK YOU DON'T THINK I CAN KILL YOU 
GOTCHA GOT ONE EYE GOT THE OTHER EYE 
YOU SEE THE MORE SPECIFIC A FANTASY IS THE MORE DANGEROUS IT IS 
ALL YOU DO FOR MY MOM IS THIS HONEY POO SHIT 
HONEY POO HONEY POO 
PREMATURELY EJACULATING PIECE OF DICK SHIT MOTHERFUCKING MCBEEF 
HOW DARE YOU TALK TO YOUR STEPFATHER LIKE THAT 
EAT THIS YOU GIANT TREE TRUNK PIECE OF ASS 
NOW THAT'S ENOUGH 
THE PLAY ENDS WITH THE STEPFATHER KILLING THE YOUNG ANTI HERO 
THERE ARE DESTRUCTIVE FANTASIES IN ALL OF THE WRITINGS 
THOSE DESTRUCTIVE FANTASIES HAVE TO DO WITH DESTROYING OTHERS 
AND WITH SELF DESTRUCTION 
TIME AND AGAIN CHO'S PROTAGONISTS BATTLE AGAINST OPPRESSION 
THE FANTASY OF VICTIMHOOD 
IS ALWAYS MORE APPEALING THAN THE REALITY OF FAILURE 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WAS TO BE THE YEAR OF CHO'S GRADUATION 
EVERYONE WAS DISCUSSING FUTURE JOBS AND PROSPECTS 
RELUCTANTLY SO WAS CHO 
AS WITH MANY ASIAN FAMILIES 
THE NOTION OF NOT HAVING EMPLOYMENT 
IS ALWAYS VERY CONCERNING TO PARENTS 
SO I DID GET THAT SENSE IN THE INTERVIEW WITH THEM 
THAT THEY ASKED HIM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOUR GRADUATION 
DO YOU NEED TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND HE SAID NO 
O. K. SO SHOULD WE FIND SOME WORK FOR YOU OR DO YOU NEED HELP WITH THAT 
AND HE SAID NO 
SO THEY PROBABLY WERE BEGINNING TO WONDER WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
AND SO WAS HE 
BUT THE MARKET FOR MEDIOCRE ENGLISH MAJORS IS NEVER VERY PROMISING 
AND CHO COULDN'T COME TO TERMS WITH HIS OWN FAILINGS 
INSTEAD HE COMES UP WITH A NEW FANTASY THAT WOULD END HIS MISERY 
AND BRING HIM A BLAZE OF GLORY 
A PERSONA HE CALLED NOT QUESTION MARK OR SPANKY BUT AXE ISHMAEL 
HE COULD NOT SUCCEED SO HE SAID 
O. K. HOW CAN I LEAVE A MARK IN A WAY WHICH NO ONE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM ME 
AND HOW DO YOU DO IT IN A WAY WHICH WOULD GRAB THE WORLD'S ATTENTION 
HE WAS SORT OF MOVING AWAY FROM THIS VICTIM ROLE 
OF SOMEONE WHO THE WORLD DID NOT CONSIDER STRONG 
INTO CREATING A SORT OF A MACHO IMAGE FOR HIMSELF 
DONNING THIS PERSONA 
WHERE THE AGGRESSION TOWARDS HIMSELF AND AGGRESSION TOWARDS THE WORLD 
ARE PUT TOGETHER FOR THIS FINAL ACT OF REVENGE ON THE WORLD 
HE LAYS OUT THIS PLAN AND HIS ROLE IN THE PLAN 
HE BEGINS TO FEEL MUCH BETTER ABOUT HIMSELF 
HE BEGINS TO SEE HIMSELF AS A PERSON WHO CAN PULL THIS OFF 
HE CAN DO THIS 
CHO HAD CAPTIONED THE PHOTOS HE SENT TO N. B. C. 
AND SOME OF THESE PHOTOS WITH THEIR ACCOMPANYING TEXT 
HAVE BEEN RELEASED WITH THE SWEARING EXCISED 
OH THE HAPPINESS I COULD HAVE HAD MINGLING AMONG YOU HEDONISTS 
BEING COUNTED AS ONE OF YOU 
ONLY IF YOU DIDN'T THE LIVING OUT OF ME 
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT 
I COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT 
ASK YOURSELF WHAT YOU DID TO ME TO HAVE MADE ME CLEAN THE SLATE 
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW THAT YOU'VE DESTROYED MY LIFE 
NOW THAT YOU'VE STOLEN EVERYTHING YOU COULD FROM ME 
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW 
ALL THE YOU'VE GIVEN ME RIGHT BACK AT YOU 
WITH HOLLOW POINTS 
DON'T YOU JUST WISH YOU'D FINISHED ME OFF WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE 
DON'T YOU WISH YOU COULD HAVE KILLED ME 
LET THE REVOLUTION BEGIN 
ONCE THE FANTASY GETS TO A CERTAIN POINT THEY'RE ALL THE ENEMY 
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER SPECIFIC NAMES ANY MORE 
YOU'RE STRIKING OUT AGAINST SOCIETY 
AGAINST A SITUATION THAT WOULD NOT INCLUDE 
THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW YOU FULL PARTICIPATION 
AND SO IT WAS THAT AFTER MONTHS OF PLANNING 
AND PLAYING AT BEING A KILLER 
CHO LEFT HIS ROOM ON A COLD APRIL MORNING 
HE LOADED HIS WEAPONS AND WENT TO WEST AMBLER JOHNSTON HALL 
AND TWO HOURS LATER TO NORRIS HALL 
TO COMMIT HIS ACTS OF MURDER 
IT WAS A SNOWY MONDAY OUR CLASS WAS ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK NINE HUNDRED THIRTY 
AND SO I REMEMBER WAKING UP AND SEEING THE FLURRIES OUTSIDE 
SO I STARTED THINKING O. K. TIME TO GET DRESSED GET TO CLASS 
AND A FRIEND OF MINE PICKED ME UP AND TOOK US IN 
WE WERE ALREADY LATE OF COURSE 
PEOPLE ARE JUST KIND OF TALKING ABOUT THE WEEKEND AND PLANS 
TEACHER HANDS US A WORKSHEET 
AFTER ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES WE STARTED HEARING A LOUD BANG AND LOUD POPS 
AT FIRST YOU DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT 
IT'S LIKE O. K. THIS IS KIND OF STRANGE 
AND THEN THEY GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER AND FASTER AND FASTER 
OUR PROFESSOR KIND OF PEEPED OUT 
SHE'S A VERY CALM WOMAN BUT HER FACE KIND OF GOT THIS ALARMED LOOK 
SHE CLOSED THE DOOR SAID CALL NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
TWO OTHER STUDENTS JUMPED UP WITH HER AND BARRICADED THE DOOR 
THIS WHOLE TIME WE'RE IN COMPLETE SHOCK 
AND I REMEMBER THINKING LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON 
THIS CAN'T BE REAL 
WE ALL DROPPED TO THE FLOOR 
AND GOT THE QUICKEST PROTECTION WE COULD FIND 
THAT'S WHEN HE CAME IN AND HE PUSHED RIGHT THROUGH A COUPLE OF DESKS 
PUSHED THEM OUT OF THE WAY 
AND I REMEMBER I WAS UNDER THE DESK HUNCHED UNDER IT 
AND I LOOKED TO THE LEFT 
AND AT THIS POINT I'M STILL THINKING THAT THIS IS SOME KIND OF DRILL MAYBE 
AND YEAH HE STARTED SHOOTING 
HE WENT STRAIGHT DOWN THE AISLES 
VERY PLANNED VERY DELIBERATE VERY DETERMINED 
NO EMOTION AT ALL 
EVERY SO OFTEN HE WOULD FIRE IT WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A YELP 
OR A SCREAM 
I REMEMBER A BULLET HIT THE WALL TWO INCHES ABOVE MY HEAD 
I REMEMBER LOOKING UP 
AND THE POWDER FROM THE WALL BRUSHED MY ARM 
AND I COULD SMELL THE DEBRIS I WAS JUST LIKE THIS IS REAL 
IT WAS ALL PRETTY MUCH A BLUR 
AFTER THE FIRST BULLET HIT AND THE SEARING PAIN 
I WAS HIT SEVERAL TIMES 
ONE WAS IN MY BACK MY LOWER BACK ONE WAS IN MY BUTTOCK 
THEN MY FOOT WAS THE THIRD ONE 
THAT WAS A RICOCHET I THINK IT WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH 
MY BODY HAD NEVER FELT SO COLD 
I REMEMBER MY THROAT WAS DRY 
I WAS JUST KIND OF GASPING FOR AIR THE ENTIRE TIME 
HE LEFT OUR ROOM AT SOME POINT 
I REMEMBER HEARING PEOPLE IN OUR CLASSROOM JUST WHISPERING HUSHED 
DON'T MOVE DON'T TALK 
I REMEMBER HEARING A LOT OF COUGHING 
AND GURGLED NOISES 
CELL PHONES STARTED GOING OFF 
BUT IT WAS PRETTY QUIET 
FOR THE AMOUNT OF PAIN AND SUFFERING THAT WAS GOING ON 
HE CAME BACK A COUPLE OF TIMES 
MAKE SURE PEOPLE WEREN'T ALIVE 
ONCE THE FIRST POLICE KNOCKED IT WAS LIKE O. K. WE'RE GONNA GET SAVED 
THEY CRASHED THROUGH THE DOOR 
I REMEMBER SEEING THE BLACK SWAT TEAM 
THEY LOOKED AROUND 
ONE OF THE POLICEMEN SAID 
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF BLACK 
I REMEMBER THINKING WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
AND THEN HE WENT TO THE GIRL NEXT TO ME AND CALLED THAT A BLACK 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I REALISED OH BLACK MEANS THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT
