OUT OF A BOOK 
THE MOOD ON THIS 
STREET HAS CHANGED MANY TIMES IN 
RECENT WEEKS FIRST THERE WAS A 
SENSE OF DESPERATION WHEN SHANNON 
WENT MISSING THEN CELEBRATION WHEN 
SHE WAS FOUND THREE WEEKS LATER 
THIS EVENING THE MOOD HAS CHANGED 
ONCE AGAIN THE MATTHEWS' HOME LIES 
EMPTY WITH ONLY A FEW REMINDERS OF 
FAMILY LIFE AS WE SPEAK TONIGHT 
THESE LEAFLETS ARE BEING HANDED OUT 
BY WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE THEY ARE 
THANKING THE LOCAL COMMUNITY FOR 
THEIR HELP IN FINDING SHANNON THREE 
WEEKS AGO BUT THERE IS ALSO A 
WARNING POLICE ARE TELLING LOCAL 
PEOPLE YES THIS INVESTIGATION 
ISN'T CONTINUING BUT THEY WARN 
THEM NOT TO TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR 
OWN HANDS AND LET DETECTIVES 
CONTINUE TO DO THE JOB 
THE OLYPMIC TORCH IS IN SAN 
FRANCISCO AND ALREADY THE THE 
PROTESTS HAVE STARTED SECURITY IS 
TIGHT FOLLOWING THE DISRUPTION IN 
ATHENS LONDON AND PARIS AND 
AMBULANCES ARE LINING THE SIX MILE 
ROUTE AND THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON 
FLIGHTS OVER THE CITY THE RELAY IS 
MEANT TO TAKE FOUR MONTHS WHAT 
HAPPENS IN SAN FRANCISCO COULD 
DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS STOPPED 
AFTER JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
RAJESH MIRCHANDANI JOINS US FROM 
SAN FRANCISCO TONIGHT 
OLYPMIC OFFICIALS CHINESE 
AUTHORITIES AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
AROUND THE WORLD ARE WATCHING 
CLOSELY WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS CITY 
IN THE COMING HOURS MORE THAN 
SIX THOUSAND ARE EXPECTED TO DEMONSTRATE 
HERE ALONG THIS SIX MILE ROUTE OF 
THE RELAY CIVIC LEADERS HAVE 
VOICED THEIR OWN CONCERNS ONE TOLD 
THE RALLY THE TORCH WILL BE MET 
WITH GREAT ALARM AND SIGNIFICANT 
PROTEST IT ALREADY HAS BEEN 
THE OLYPMIC FLAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
A SYMBOL OF PEACE AND UNIT BUT 
SINCE ITS ARRIVAL AT IT'S ONLY U. S. 
DESTINATION IT HAS BROUGHT ANGER 
AND PROTEST UNITY THIS HAS BEEN 
SAN FRANCISCO'S WELCOME FOR THE 
TORCH SIGNIFICANT CROWDS 
PROTESTING AGAINST CHINA'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD AND POLICIES IN TIBET 
AND ELSEWHERE THESE PEOPLE SAY 
THEIRS IS A NON VIOLENT CAMPAIGN 
BUT AHEAD OF THE TORCH RELAY 
PASSIONS ARE SIMMERING HOW 
CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT THERE WON'T 
BE ANY VIOLENCE 
I'M PRETTY 
CONFIDENT RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS 
STILL HARD TO SAY BECAUSE WE ARE 
ALSO HUMANS AND WE ARE NOT ALL 
DALAI LAMAS AND WE ARE PREACHING 
NON VIOLENCE BUT WE ARE ONLY 
HUMANS 
TODAY THAT FLAME IN THE HUMANS EYES OF MOST TIBETANS IS BLOOD 
THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN A HIGH 
PROFILE PROTEST SEVEN PEOPLE WERE 
ARRESTED AFTER PROTIBET BANNERS 
WERE UNFURLED ON THE CITY'S ICONIC 
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE AND AT A CANDLE 
LIGHT VIGIL CROWDS WERE ADDRESSED 
BY INTERNATIONAL SUPPORTERS 
USUALLY WE HAVE TO FIGHT TO FIND 
PLACES TO GIVE INTERVIEWS AND TALK 
ABOUT THE TIBETAN SUFFERING BUT 
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED WE HAVE 
SPONTANEOUSLY THE UNIVERSE HAS 
OPENED UP 
NOW THE CITY IS TAKING 
NO CHANCES A ROUTE HAS BEEN CHOSEN 
ALONG THIS WIDE BOULEVARD BECAUSE 
OFFICIALS THOUGHT THEY COULD 
CONTROL THAT MORE EASILY RATHER 
THAN NARROW STREETS IN OTHER PARTS 
OF THE CITY THE TORCH BEARERS ARE 
GOING TO BE FLANKED BY MOTOR CYCLE 
POLICEMEN FROM CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY 
PATROL ALL OFFDUTY POLICE OFFICERS 
HAVE BEEN DRAFTED IN AND CHINESE 
NATIONALS THE BOYS IN BLUE ARE DUE 
TO ACCOMPANY THE THE PARADE THIS 
TORCH BEARER SAYS SHE IS SCARED FOR 
HER SAFETY 
OF COURSE I'M CONCERNED 
FOR MY SAFETY L. THINK EVERYONE IS 
I ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE RIGHT OF ALL 
THE PROTESTERS TO BE HERE AND HAVE 
NO ISSUE WITH THAT WHATSOEVER L. DO 
FEEL VERY SAD BY ALL OF THE 
PROTESTS THAT HAVE TURNED VIOLENT 
EARLY THIS MORNING CHINESE CULTURAL 
GROUPS TOOK THEIR PLACES ALONG THE 
ROUTE HOPING TO COUNTER THE 
DEMONSTRATERS 
I THINK THEY ARE DEMONSTRATERS DISRUPTING THE PEACEFUL PROCESS AND 
THE MEANING OF THE GAMES 
THEY HAVE 
THEIR PEACEFUL PROTESTING AND THAT 
IS FINE WE ARE JUST HERE TO 
WELCOME THE TORCH AND THEY DO DO 
THEIR OWN STUFF 
SCENES LIKE THIS 
MAY NOT BE WHAT PEOPLE REMEMBER 
FROM THIS LATEST LEG OF THE TORCH 
RELAY RELAY LATER THIS MORNING CITY LEADERS 
HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT SECURITY 
EXPERTS ABOUT A POSSIBLE ROUTE 
CHANGE THEY SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WHAT 
WILL HAPPEN HERE BUT WHATEVER DOES 
IT COULD LEAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON 
THIS YEAR'S TORCH RELAY AND MAYBE 
THE GAMES THEMSELVES 
IN BEIJING OLYPMIC OFFICIALS HAVE 
BEEN DISCUSSING PREPARATIONS FOR 
THE GAMES WITH THE CHINESE PREMIER 
BUT IT IS THE FATE OF THAT RELAY 
WHICH IS OVERSHADOWING EVENTS 
MIHIR BOSE REPORTS NOW FROM BEIJING 
A VERY DIFFERENT PROTEST BY TIBETAN 
MONKS IN WESTERN CHINA TODAY 
CHINA THE OLYPMIC MOVEMENT IS 
BEGINNING TO REALISE THAT IT NEEDS 
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE 
THERE ARE MANY CONFLICTS IN MANY 
COUNTRIES BUT HERE WE ARE IN THE 
COUNTRY WHERE THE GAMES WILL TAKE 
PLACE AND WE WANT TO HELP CHINA 
CHINA'S OLYPMIC STADIUM WILL BE 
GLEAMING COME THE OPENING CEREMONY 
BUT CLEANING UP THE IMAGE OF THE 
RELAY WILL MOVE A LOT MORE 
DIFFICULT DESPITE I. O. C. MISGIVINGS 
CHINA IS DETERMINED TO COMPLETE THE 
JOURNEY BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE 
IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS DURING THE OLYPMIC TORCH 
RELAY TO TIBET OR MOUNT EVEREST WE 
WILL WITHOUT DOUBT DEAL WITH THOSE 
PERSONS SEVERELY WE WILL NOT BE 
MERCIFUL 
IT IS THIS IMAGE WHICH HAS SEEN THE 
TORCH ESCORTED BY CHIN KNEES 
MILITARY POLICE THROUGH LONDON AND 
CHINESE MILITARY POLICE THROUGH 
LONDON AND PAR RACE THIS HAS NOT 
GONE DOWN WELL IT IS SEEN TO HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN OVER BY CHINA PARIS 
THE UNHAPPINESS EXTENDS BEYOND THE 
I. O. C. TO COUNTRIES DUE TO HOST THE 
TORCH THE THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER KEPT 
TRADE LINKS OPEN BY SPEAKING IN 
MANDARIN IN BEIJING TODAY BUT THE 
POLICE CHIEF HAS SAID THE TORCH'S 
SECURITY ENTOURAGE WOULD NOT BE 
WELCOME DOWN UNDER WITH THE CLOCK 
TICKING TO THE START OF THE GAMES I 
AM TOLD THAT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC 
COMMITTEE THERE IS INCREASING 
PRESSURE FOR A PUBLIC STATEMENT 
ASKING CHINA TO SETTLE THE TIBET 
ISSUE RIGHTS 
AND HELP RESCUE THE IMAGE OF THE 
GAMES GAMES U. S. COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIALS SAY 
AN AL QAEDA LEADER RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ATTACKS ON U. S. FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN

EXTERNAL OPERATIONS ACCORDING TO 
OFFICIALS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 
ATLANTIC IF HE WAS ONLY IN CHARGE 
OF ATTACKING U. S. FORCES IN 
AFGHANISTAN WE WOBBLY WOULDN'T BE 
REPORTING IT BUT HE IS BELIEVED TO 
VN BEHIND THE PLANNING AND TRAINING 
FOR ATTACKERS AGAINST CORE TARGETS 
IN THE WEST MOVING OUTSIDE THE 
SOUTH ASIA REGION HE IS BELIEVED 
TO HAVE DIED WITHIN THE LAST TWO 
MONTHS EITHER IN PAKISTAN OR 
AFGHANISTAN IT SEEMS THE 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES KNEW ABOUT 
THIS BUT IN ORDER TO HIDE SOURCES 
AND HOW MUCH THEY KNEW AND FROM WHO 
THEY HAVE ONLY JUST RELEASED THIS 
HE IS SOMEBODY WHO STARTED OUT AS A 
MILITARY COMMANDER IN AFGHANISTAN 
IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF NINE ELEVEN 
HE'S AN EGYPTIAN HE THEN DECIDED 
TO THINK BIG AND APPARENTLY HE WAS 
SO IMPORTANT SO KEY TO AL QAEDA 
THAT ALL THESE WEEKS LATER HE 
HASN'T BEEN RELEASED HE WILL BE

QAEDA REPLACED

BRITAIN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH IS GOING 
TO BE LOWER THAN THE GOVERNMENT 
PREDICTED THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND IT 
ALSO SAID THE U. K. IS UNDER THREAT 
FROM THE SHARP FALL IN HOUSE PRICES 
OUR ECONOMIC REPORTER HAS THIS 
REPORT REPORT THE CLOUDS ARE GATHERING AROUND THE 
WORLD'S ECONOMIC POWERHOUSES NOT 
LEAST HERE AT CANARY WHARF IN EAST 
LONDON IT'S HOME OF SOME OF THE 
LEADING BANKS WHAT IS THE VIEW 
DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND AT THIS 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S LEADER FINANCIAL 
CENTRES I'VE COME TO TEST THE 
TEMPERATURE AND ASSESS THE MOOD 
AMONG EXPERTS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS 
LATER GLOOMY FORECAST FROM THE THE 
I. M. F. FIRST A LOOK ON HOW MUCH THE 
WORLD ECONOMY WILL SLOW DOWN IF THE 
FALLOUT FROM THE THE CREDIT CRISIS 
I THINK THE I. M. F. IS CONFIRMING WHAT 
MOST NEW THAT THE U. S. ECONOMY IS IN 
SOME KIND OF RECESSION BUT 
PROBABLY THE MORE INTERESTING 
FEATURE IS THEY ARE NOT LOOK FOR 
THINGS TO RECOVER QUICKLY THEY 
THINK THE TWO HUNDRED YEAR WILL NOT SHOW 
ANY MEANINGFUL RECOVERY AND 
THEREFORE THERE WILL BE ON GOING 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REST OF THE 
WORLD TWO THOUSAND NINE 
THE I. M. F. HAS A BLEAK 
FORECAST FOR THE U. K. AS WELL AS 
OTHER LEADING ECONOMIES 
HOW DOES THIS EXPERT ON THE U. K. 
ECONOMY THINK THINGS WILL FEEL FOR 
COMPANIES AND HOUSEHOLDS 
I THINK 
IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT WE SEE GROWTH 
IN THE ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER 
THAN WE HAVE GOT USED TO RECENTLY 
IN THE U. K. IT MAY WELL MEAN THAT 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS GOING UP AND VERY 
LIKELY WE ARE GOING TO SEE HOUSE 
PRICES FALLING PERHAPS FOR A 
SUSTAINED PERIOD L. SHOULD SAY WE 
SHOULDN'T THINK OF FALLING HOUSE 
PRICES AS NECESSARILY A BAD THING 
THERE ARE GAINERS AND LOSERS THE THE VIEW FROM HERE IS FAR FROM ROSY 
AND THE MESSAGE IS FASTEN YOUR 
SEATBELTS FOR SORT OF BUMPY 
ECONOMIC RIDE WHICH WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES OTHER 
RECESSION THIS YEAR OR NEXT STILL 
SEEMS UNLIKELY BUT ECONOMIC GROWTH 
MAY WELL BE PAINFULLY SLOW DON'T 
EXPECT THE PICTURE TO CLEAR FOR A 
WHILE YET HUNDREDS OF BRITISH 
HOLIDAYMAKERS HAVE BEEN LEFT 
STRANDED FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF 
A LOW COST AIRLINE OASIS HAS GONE 
INTO LIQUIDATION AFTER JUST SEVENTEEN 
MONTHS SOARING FUEL PRICES AND THE 
GLOBAL CREDIT CRUNCH HAS 
CONTRIBUTED TO THEDOWN FALL 
MOTHER OF DAMILOLA TAYLOR HAS DIED

PLAID CYMRU HAS BEEN SETTING OUT 
ITS POLICIES FOR THE FORTHCOMING 
LOCAL ELECTIONS IN WALES THE PARTY 
LEADER SAYS HE'S CONFIDENT OF 
MAKING GAINS IN THE 
FIRST POLL 
AND SAID THEIR CAMPAIGN WOULD BE 
DOMINATED BY TWO KEY THINGS FIRST FIRST OF ALL OF COURSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
ISSUES AND THE GREEN AGENDA WHICH 
I THINK PERMEATES EVERYTHING THAT 
WE ARE DOING IN TERMS OF THE LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT AGENDA HEALTHY LIVING 
OF COURSE IS A KEY ASPECT OF THAT 
AND I MENTIONED THOSE TWO TWIN 
THEMES IN MY CONFERENCE SPEECH 
WHICH IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE 
WE PROMOTE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND 
SECONDLY OF COURSE THAT THE GREEN 
AGENDA ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
ARE AT THE CORE OF EVERYTHING THAT 
WE DO

TREATED AS A FREAK SHOW SHE IS MY 
DAUGHTER HE TOLD ME L. DON'T WANT 
ANY MORE OF THIS I'M FED UP BUT 
HE IS UP AGAINST CENTURIES OF 
SUPERSTITION MANY HERE BELIEVE 
LALI IS THE REINCARNATION OF 
HINDU GODDESS 
GOD HAS SHOWN US 
SOMETHING MAGICAL SO WE REGARD HER

THEY'RE COMING EVERY DAY TO SEE HER 
SOME PEOPLE ARE DRIVING GREAT 
DISTANCES THERE IS EVEN TALK OF A 
TEMPLE BEING BUILT IN HER HONOUR 
DOCTORS HERE SAY THERE IS NO 
POSSIBILITY OF SEPARATING HER HEAD
