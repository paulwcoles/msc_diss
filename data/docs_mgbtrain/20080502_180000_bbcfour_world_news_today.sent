THIS IS B. B. C. WORLD NEWS TODAY WITH 
ME ZEINAB BADAWI THE WORST LOCAL 
ELECTION PERFORMANCE BY LABOUR FOR 
FORTY YEARS THEY ARE PUSHED INTO 
THIRD PLACE IN THEIR SHARE OF THE 
VOTE JOY FOR THE CONSERVATIVES 
SHOCK FOR LABOUR THE PRIME 
MINISTER GORDON BROWN SAYS HE 
WILL LISTEN AND LEARN WHAT MISTAKES 
WERE MADE HOW FIVE HE NOW DAMAGED 
GOODS 
IT IS CLEAR THIS HAS BEEN A GOODS DISAPPOINTING NIGHT INDEED A BAD 
NIGHT FOR LABOUR WE HAVE LESSONS 
TO LEARN FROM THAT 
IT IS OFFICIAL 
ROBERT MUGABE LOST THE FIRST ROUND 
OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO THE 
OPPOSITION HIS FIRST DEFEAT IN TWENTY EIGHT 
YEARS BUT THERE HAS TO BE A RUN 
OFF OFF IS THERE NO END IN SIGHT TO THE 
PALESTINIAN SUFFERING 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE NEGOTIATORS ON 
THE MIDDLE EAST MEET IN LONDON HOW 
MUCH HIS GUARDS ARE ON THEIR MINDS 
AND ISTANBUL A WORLD HERITAGE CITY 
IN DANGER UNESCO WARNS THE TURKISH 
AUTHORITIES THAT IT MAY BE 
BLACKLISTED AS AN HISTORIC SITE IS 
AT RISK 
HELLO WELCOME SIR GORDON BROWN 
SAID THAT THE LOCAL ELECTION 
RESULTS WERE BAD AND DISAPPOINTING 
ONE VETERAN ELECTION OBSERVER SAID 
THEY WERE MORE LIKE AN UNALLOYED 
DISASTER LABOUR LOST CONTROL OF 
THREE HUNDRED SEATS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
HOURS WE ARE EXPECTING THE RESULTS 
OF THE CONTEST OF THE MAYOR OF 
LONDON WHICH COULD BRING MORE BAD 
NEWS FOR LABOUR THERE ARE STRONG 
SUGGESTIONS THAT KEN LIVINGSTONE 
SEEKING A THIRD TERM COULD BE 
DEFEATED BY THE CONSERVATIVE 
CANDIDATE BORIS JOHNSON OUR 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JON DEVITT 
HAS THE DETAILS OF A DISASTROUS 
NIGHT FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
IT WAS A BAD BAD NIGHT FOR LABOUR 
ITS WORST IN COUNCIL ELECTIONS FOR 
FORTY YEARS IN CITIES ACROSS ENGLAND 
AND WALES THE GOVERNING PARTY WAS 
LOSING CONTROL OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
ONCE REGARDED AS LABOUR STRONGHOLDS 
THIS WAS NOT A GENERAL ELECTION 
BUT IT WAS THE FIRST ELECTORAL TEST 
FOR THE MAN WHO TOOK OVER AS 
LABOUR'S LEADER LAST JUNE 
IT IS 
CLEAR TO ME THIS HAS BEEN A 
DISAPPOINTING NIGHT INDEED A BAD 
NIGHT FOR LABOUR WE HAVE LESSONS 
TO LEARN FROM THAT THEN WE WILL 
MOVE FORWARD MY JOB WAS TO LISTEN 
AND TO LEAD THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO 
MR. BROWN WAS QUICK TO BLAME THE 
ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN WHICH HAS SEEN 
BRITISH BANKS IN TROUBLE HOUSE 
PRICES FALLING AND FOOD AND ENERGY 
BILLS RISING MR. BROWN'S REPUTATION 
FOR ECONOMIC COMPETENCE HAS HELPED 
KEEP LABOUR IN POWER FOR ELEVEN YEARS 
NOW THAT REPUTATION IS IN DOUBT AND 
MR. BROWN BLAMES INTERNATIONAL 
PRESSURES BUT HIS OWN DECISIONS ON 
TAX HAVE NOT HELPED A CHANGE AIMED 
AT STREAMLINING THE SYSTEM ENDED UP 
PENALISING SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID 
WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY 
EVERY DAY 
THAT PASSES IT GETS HARDER FOR 
GORDON BROWN TO TAKE A GRIP ON THIS 
AND TURN IT AROUND SAY I AM IN 
CHARGE AND THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO 
GET BETTER THE CREDIT SQUEEZE 
MIGHT BE OVER IF THAT IS RIGHT IN 
SIX MONTHS' TIME VOTERS MAY NOT BE 
SO CROSS WE DON'T KNOW WHATEVER WHATEVER THE LOCAL ELECTION RESULTS IT IS 
THE MAKE UP OF THIS PLACE 
PARLIAMENT WHICH REALLY MATTERS TO 
THE GOVERNMENT THE LABOUR PARTY 
HAS DONE BADLY IN LOCAL ELECTIONS 
BEFORE THEY HAVE THEN GONE ON TO 
WIN A GENERAL ELECTION JUST A FEW 
MONTHS LATER THE FUNDAMENTAL 
QUESTION FROM THESE RESULTS IS DO 
THEY ILLUSTRATE A BIG SHIFT IN 
PUBLIC OPINION 
LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
THE LEADER OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY WAS QUICK TO 
SEIZE THE MOMENT DURING THE 
COUNTRY TALKING OF A BREAKTHROUGH 
FOR HIS PARTY IT TO RING THEIR 
PROJECTED SHARE OF THE NATIONAL 
VOTE HAS REACHED FORTY FOUR PER CENT IF 
TRANSLATED TO PARLIAMENT THAT 
WOULD GIVE THEM A CLEAR MAJORITY I I THINK THIS IS A BIG MOMENT FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY I DON'T WANT 
ANYONE TO THINK THAT WE WOULD 
DESERVE TO WIN AN ELECTION JUST ON 
THE BACK OF A FAILING GOVERNMENT I 
WANT US TO PROVE TO PEOPLE WE CAN 
MAKE THE CHANGES THEY WANT TO SEE 
IN TERMS OF SCHOOLS HOSPITALS 
CRIME AND THE OTHER ISSUES THAT 
REALLY MATTER TO WAR OF US THIS THIS WAS ALSO THE FIRST ELECTORAL TEST 
FOR NICK CLEGG THE NEW LEADER OF 
THE THIRD PARTY THE LIBERAL NEW MOOD THESE ELECTIONS ARE THE CLEAREST SIGN THAT THE 
POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF BRITAIN IS 
CHANGING THE SIGHT OF ONCE 
UNASSAILABLE LABOUR STRONGHOLDS 
BEING LOST IS A WARNING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT THAT SOMETHING HAS TO 
CHANGE THE BIG QUESTION FOR THE 
COMING MONTHS IS WHAT IF ANYTHING 
MR. BROWN CAN DO IT 
JON DEVITT WILL JOIN US LIVE IN A 
MOMENT FIRST AS WE SAID THERE 
COULD BE MORE DESPAIR FOR LABOUR IF 
THE CONSERVATIVES WIN THE RACE TO 
BECOME MAYOR OF LONDON BEING MAYOR 
OF A CITY LIKE LONDON CATAPULTS THE 
INCUMBENT INTO THE SPOTLIGHT AND 
ALLOWS THEM TO BOLSTER NATIONAL 
GOVERNMENTS WILL MAKE LIFE 
DIFFICULT FOR THEM THE VICTORY OF 
GIANNI ALEMANNO IN ROME THIS WEEK 
REPRESENTED A HUGE SHIFT IN THE 
CITY THE LEFT OF CENTRE NO LONGER 
CONTROLLED THE CAPITAL HE 
CAMPAIGNED ON TIGHTENING OF 
SECURITY AND CRACKING DOWN ON 
IMMIGRANTS IN PARIS THE BEAR 
BERTRAND DELANOE WAS THE FIRST 
OPENLY GAY POLITICIAN IN FRANCE IN 
AMERICA THE BILLIONAIRE MIKE 
BLOOMBERG IS MAYOR OF NEW YORK AND 
HAS USED HIS POSITION TO PROMOTE A 
GREEN REVOLUTION HE IS CONVERTING 
THE FLEET OF YELLOW TAXIS INTO 
HYBRID VEHICLES HE HAS BEEN DUBBED 
A DEMOCRAT AND A REPUBLICAN AND 
REPORTEDLY CONSIDERED RUNNING FOR 
PRESIDENT PRESIDENT SO THE CONTRAST IN LONDON IT 
OFFERS THE MAYOR A POWERFUL 
POSITION WHETHER IT IS KEN 
LIVINGSTONE OR BORIS JOHNSON WHO 
IS BELIEVED TO BE AHEAD IT WILL BE 
AN INDICATOR OF THE NATION'S MOOD 
IN A MOMENT WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO 
A LONDON LABOUR M. P. FIRST LET'S GO 
TO WESTMINSTER AND JON DEVITT 
DESPONDENCY IN THE EVER AMONG 
LABOUR M. P.'S 
THERE IS PARTICULARLY 
BECAUSE THE RESULTS ARE SO MUCH 
WORSE THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS 
QUITE DIFFICULT FOR LABOUR TO DO 
BADLY BECAUSE THE LAST TIME THESE 
COUNCIL ELECTIONS WERE FOUGHT IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR IT WAS JUST AFTER THE IRAQ 
WAR WHEN LABOUR WAS ALREADY VERY 
POPULAR AND POPULAR GORDON 
BROWN WAS EXPECTED TO REVITALISE 
THE PARTY MAKE IT ELECTORAL 
ELECTORALLY WINNABLE HE HAS NOT 
MANAGED TO DO THAT THIS IS HIS 
FIRST BIG TEST AND THERE ARE 
CERTAINLY DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER HE 
HAS MANAGED TO PULL OFF THE SORT OF 
TRANSFORMATION OF THE PARTY THAT HE 
HAD PROMISED 
EVEN KEN LIVINGSTONE 
UP UNTIL NOW HE HAS BEEN A BIG VOTE 
WINNER HIS POSITION IS LOOKING 
DICEY 
KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS MANAGED DICEY TO WIN VOTES BEYOND THE LABOUR 
PARTY BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A BIG 
PERSONALITY IF HE HAS NOT DONE AS 
WELL AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED IN THE 
SELECTION IF HE HAS INDEED LOST IT 
THEN THAT WILL BE A BIG SHOCK FOR 
THE LABOUR PARTY IT WOULD SUGGEST 
THAT NOT ONLY IS LABOUR LOSING ITS 
BEDROCK VOTES AND OF THE BOATS 
THAT IT HAS ATTRACTED IN LONDON 
OVER THE LAST TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS BUT 
IT IS ALSO LOSING THE SORT OF VOTES 
THAT ARE ATTRACTED TO PEOPLE LIKE 
KEN LIVINGSTONE QUITE MAVERICK 
CHARACTERS IN A LABOUR PARTY AND 
HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDA AS WELL 
JOINING US IN THE STUDIO IS BARRY 
GARDINER THE LABOUR M. P. FOR BRENT 
NORTH AND LONDON THE NEIGHBOURING 
CONSTITUENCY TO WHERE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE ONCE SERVED AS A LABOUR 
M. P. THESE ELECTION RESULTS ARE 
BEING SEEN AS AN ELECTION ON GORDON 
BROWN PRETTY SERIOUS FOR THE PRIME 
MINISTER 
WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY IS MINISTER THAT IT IS PRETTY SERIOUS FOR ALL 
OF US WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
ALL GET OUT THERE AND MAKE OUR 
MESSAGE GET ACROSS IF YOU LOOK AT 
WHAT KEN HAS DONE IN LONDON HE HAS 
DELIVERED CROSSRAIL HE HAS 
DELIVERED PEACE ON POLICE ON THE 
BEAT HE HAS DELIVERED THE OLYMPICS 
HE HAS DONE ALL THE THINGS HE 
PROMISED HE WOULD BUT THE 
ELECTORATE DO NOT VOTE FOR YOU ON 
WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE THEY 
WANT TO KNOW YOU HAVE POLITICS FOR 
THE FUTURE AND THE IDEAS THAT WILL 
MAKE THEIR RIDE LIVES BETTER 
MAYBE THEY HAVE JUST HAD ENOUGH OF 
YOU ALL SORRY TO PUT IT SO BLUNTLY 
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN ANY 
MARRIAGE THERE COMES A SEVEN YEAR 
POINT WHERE PEOPLE LOOK AROUND AND 
SAY WELL HOW ARE THINGS IS THERE 
SOMEWHERE ELSE I MIGHT BE BETTER 
OFF 
IT IS THE MIRROR IMAGE OF WHAT OFF HAPPENED AT LOCAL ELECTIONS IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
WHEN THE CONSERVATIVES LOST BY TWENTY 
PERCENTAGE POINTS TO LABOUR TWO 
YEARS LATER LABOUR WON THE GENERAL 
ELECTION 
ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT ELECTION THE TRADITION OF GOVERNMENTS 
WINNING GENERAL ELECTIONS AND THEN 
DOING VERY BADLY IN THE INTERIM 
LOCAL ELECTIONS THAT HAS GOT QUITE 
A TRADITION THE LAST TIME WE HAD 
TWENTY SEVEN POINTS THIS TIME WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR 
POINTS BUT WE WENT ON TO WIN THE 
GENERAL ELECTION 
YOU'RE NOT TRYING 
TO PUT A GOOD COURSE ON THIS NO NO IT WAS A DISAPPOINTING RESULT IT 
IS A RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL OF US 
COUNCILLORS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY 
WE HAVE TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT 
ACTUALLY WE CAN OFFER THEM POLICIES 
THAT CAN CHANGE THEIR LIVES FOR THE 
BETTER IN THE FUTURE NOT JUST THAT 
WE MANAGE TO DO IT IN THE PAST 
THAT IS WHAT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE 
BEEN STRONG ENOUGH IN DOING 
ON THE 
MAYOR CONTEST I CAN STILL SEE YOU 
ARE WEARING YOUR BADGE FOR KEN IF 
BORIS JOHNSON HAS DEFEATED KEN 
LIVINGSTONE THAT WOULD GIVE THE 
CONSERVATIVES AN IMPORTANT PLATFORM 
TO SHOWCASE THEIR POLICIES TWO TWO THINGS KEN HAS BEEN AN EXCEPTIONAL 
MAYOR HE HAS COMMITTED HIMSELF TO 
LONDON OVER THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS IN A WAY 
THAT HAS BEEN QUITE AMAZING I 
THINK IT WOULD BE A PERSONAL 
TRAGEDY IF KEN DOES LOSE WHAT IS 
MORE ASTONISHING IS THAT LONDON 
SHOULD CHOOSE SOMEBODY AS MAYOR WHO 
HAVE TO BE GONE OUT AND FOUND 
BORIS HAD NO INTEREST 
IT DOESN'T 
MATTER IF HE IS A VOTE WINNER AND 
IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS AHEAD 
IF HE 
HAS WON THAT ELECTION I WOULD 
WELCOME THE SCRUTINY THAT IT WILL 
PUT ON CONSERVATIVE POLICIES A 
QUARTER OF THE POPULATION OF 
ENGLAND LIVES IN LONDON THAT MEANS 
THAT CONSERVATIVE POLICIES WILL 
COME UNDER HUGE SCRUTINY THAT THEY 
HAVE NOT HAD OVER THE PAST MONTHS 
THAT WILL MEAN THAT THEY NOW LEAD 
NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF 
THE OTHER NEWS 
IN ZIMBABWE AFTER FIVE WEEKS OF 
SPECULATION AND OFFICIAL RESULTS 
HAS BEEN DECLARED THE ZIMBABWE 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION SAID THAT 
PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE HAS LOST 
HIS MAIN RIVAL MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
HAS WON THE FIRST ROUND BUT NOT BY 
ENOUGH BOATS THERE WILL HAVE TO BE 
A SECOND ROUND OF VOTING VOTES 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO VOTES 
REPRESENTING FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE PER CENT OF THE VOTES 
CAST ROBERT MUGABE FOR THE ZANU 
P. F. PARTY ONE MILLION SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY VOTES 
REPRESENTING FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY TWO PER CENT OF THE VALID 
VOTES CAST 
ZIMBABWE'S CHIEF 
ELECTABLE ELECTORAL OFFICER 
PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF OF PAKISTAN HAS 
AGREED TO REINSTATE THE JUDGES HE 
SUSPENDED IN NOVEMBER THE FORMER 
PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF 
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD REACHED THE 
AGREEMENT THE JUDGES WILL RESUME 
THEIR POSTS ON TWELFTH MAY 
ENVOYS OF THE DALAI LAMA ARE ON 
THEIR WAY TO CHINA FOR TALKS AIMED 
AT ENDING THE CRISIS IN TIBET THIS 
WILL BE THE FIRST OFFICIAL CONTACT 
BETWEEN TIBET'S GOVERNMENT IN EXILE 
AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SINCE 
PROTESTS IN TIBET TURNED VIOLENT IN 
MARCH MARCH INTERNATIONAL MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
NEGOTIATORS HAVE BEEN GATHERED IN 
LONDON ALL DAY TO TRY AND MAKE 
CONCRETE PROGRESS ON SETTLING THE 
PALESTINIAN ISRAELI DISPUTE THERE 
ARE MANY OBSTACLES TO OVERCOME BUT 
THEY DID SAY THAT THERE IS AN 
URGENT NEED TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS 
FOR PALESTINIANS IN THE WEST BANK 
AND GAZA FIFTEEN MILLION PALESTINIANS 
LIVE IN GAZA MOST OF THEM 
DEPENDENT ON FOOD AID ISRAEL'S 
BLOCKADE IN GAZA IN RESPONSE TO 
ROCKET FIRE HAS LEFT THE TERRITORY 
ISOLATED IN A MOMENT WE WILL BE 
HEARING FROM THE E. U. COMMISSION 
INVOLVED IN THE TALKS ALEEM 
MAQBOOL HAS THIS REPORT 
IT SEEMS LIKE ALMOST EVERY DAY WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SHORTAGE OF 
ONE COMMODITY OR ANOTHER IN THE 
GAZA STRIP TODAY THE FOCUS IS ON 
COOKING GAS YOU CAN SEE ALL OF 
THESE EMPTY GAS CANISTERS LAID OUT 
IN A LONG LINE AND LEADING TO WAS 
THE GAS COMPANY WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
WAITING TO REFILL CANISTERS 
WITH THE RUMOUR THAT A SMALL 
DELIVERY OF GAS WOULD BE ALLOWED 
INTO GAZA SOON SOME HAVE BEEN 
SLEEPING AT THIS GAS STATION FOR 
THREE DAYS WITH FREQUENT PETROL 
SHORTAGES PEOPLE HAD TRIED TO 
ADAPT 
WHAT CAN I DO MANY ADAPT MANY CONVERTED THEIR CARS TO RUN ON 
COOKING GAS THIS IS A BEACH CLOSE 
TO GAZA CITY IT IS NOT A PLACE YOU 
WOULD WANT TO SWIM AROUND FORTY 
MILLION LITRES OF UNTREATED SEWAGE 
IS NOW HAVING TO BE PUMPED INTO THE 
SEAT HERE EVERY DAY 
THE REASON IT 
IS NOT BEING TREATED IS THAT THERE 
IS NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY OR FUEL 
TO POWER THE BACK UP GENERATORS 
THERE ARE NOT THE SPARE PARTS TO 
REPAIR THE SEWAGE TREATMENT WORKS 
BUSINESSES LIKE THIS CLOTHING 
FACTORY HAVE GROUND TO A HALT RAW 
MATERIALS CAN GET INTO THE 
TERRITORY BUT NO EXPORTS CAN LEAVE 
TENS OF THOUSANDS HAVE LOST THEIR 
JOBS FISHING AS WELL ONE OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT TRADE IN GAZA HAS 
BEEN BADLY AFFECTED BY FUEL 
SHORTAGES 
THIS IS THE BEST SEASON BUT WE 
CANNOT GO OUT TO FISH WE DANCE 
HAVE FUEL FOR A BOAT SO THEY STAY 
HERE IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE IN 
GAZA HAS A STORY OF HARDSHIP HOPE 
FOR THE FUTURE IS BECOMING EVER 
HARDER TO FIND 
THERE WAS DEEP CONCERN EXPRESSED 
ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN CONDITIONS 
IN GAZA AT THE MEETING IN LONDON 
TODAY OF THE QUARTET PEACE 
NEGOTIATORS UNITED NATIONS THE U. S. 
RUSSIA AND THE NEW E. U. THE UN 
SECRETARY GENERAL BAN KI MOON 
SAID BOTH SIDES IN THE CONFLICT 
NEED TO DO MORE TO MEET IN THE 
MIDDLE WE NEED TO CALL ON ISRAEL 
TO FREEZE ALL NON SECTARIAN 
ACTIVITY THEN NEED TO DISBAND OR 
DISMANTLE OUTPOSTS BUILT SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE 
THEY NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO REBUILD 
SECURITY APPARATUS 
REPRESENTING THE E. U. WAS THE 
COMMISSIONER SHE CAME OUT OVER 
TALKS AT LANCASTER HOUSE TO TALK TO 
US I ASKED HER IF WE COULD EXPECT 
CONCRETE PROGRESS ON DIFFICULT 
ISSUES ISSUES I'LL THINK IT HAS BEEN MADE VERY 
CLEAR THAT THE SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY 
IN HAS TO CEASE WE HAVE 
MENTIONED THAT I THINK ALSO THAT 
THE ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER SEIZED 
THE NECESSITY SEES THE NECESSITY 
FOR ISRAEL TO MAKE AN EFFORT ON THE 
SETTLEMENTS BUT ALSO ON THE 
QUESTIONS OF ROADBLOCKS AND ON THE 
BIG QUESTION OF FREEDOM OF ACCESS 
FOR YEARS THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ASKING ISRAEL TO 
STOP BUILDING OUTPOST AND EXPANDING 
SETTLEMENTS ON THE GROUND IT IS 
THE OPPOSITE WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE 
IT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME 
I THINK 
WE HAVE TO SEE THAT THERE ARE TWO 
IMPORTANT PROCESSES GOING ON ONE 
IS THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND IT 
SEEMS THAT BOTH PARTIES NEED TO 
TALK TO EACH OTHER THINGS ARE 
MOVING SLOWLY AMONG THEMSELVES OF 
COURSE IT IS VERY DISCREET SO 
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS AND NOW I 
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT TODAY 
THEY HAVE GIVEN US AT LEAST THE 
APPEARANCE THAT THINGS INDEED TO 
MOVE AND THERE IS HOPE UNTIL THE 
END OF THE YEAR 
TONY BLAIR HAS 
TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR 
RECONSTRUCTION BUT THAT IS ON THE 
WEST BANK WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN 
GAZA 
YOU ARE RIGHT WE HAVE TO SEE GAZA ON THE ONE HAND THE WEST BANK BUT 
ALSO DOES I THINK IN TODAY'S 
QUARTET STATEMENT WE CLEARLY SAY 
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A NEW 
APPROACH TO GAZA BY SUPPORTING THE 
EGYPTIANS ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIAN 
AUTHORITY TO BRING ABOUT A 
NEGOTIATION IN ORDER TO OPEN UP 
GAZA CROSSINGS THAT WOULD THEN 
INDUCE A SORT OF NEW OPENING BUT 
WE ARE NOT YET THERE 
THE EGYPTIANS 
HAD BEEN MEDIATING WITH HAMAS IN 
GAZA ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY THERE IS TALK OF A 
TEMPORARY CEASEFIRE IS THAT SOME 
IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WANTS TO SEE 
HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY 
WE WOULD 
SUPPORT SUCH A CEASEFIRE OR 
SOMETHING SIMILAR VERY MUCH THAT 
IS CLEAR BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE 
ARE NOT PART OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS 
SO WHAT WE CAN ONLY DO IS SHOW OUR 
APPRECIATION FOR THAT SHOW OUR 
SUPPORT AND THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE 
DONE TODAY TOWARDS THE EGYPTIAN 
FOREIGN MINISTER 
IN THE MEANTIME 
THE PEOPLE OF GAZA KARI ON 
SUFFERING CARRY ON SUFFERING 
HOW MUCH LONGER CAN THEY WAIT WE WE HAVE ALWAYS SHOWN OUR GREATEST 
PREOCCUPATION WE ARE DEEPLY 
CONCERNED AT THE SAME TIME HAMAS 
HAS TO STOP DOING THINGS LIKE FOR 
INSTANCE WHEN ISRAEL FINALLY 
ACCEPTED AGAIN IT TO DO IT BRING 
IN FUEL TWO OF THE ISRAELIS HAVE 
BEEN KILLED BY HAMAS SO THEY HAVE 
ALSO HARMED THEIR OWN POPULATION 
THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE 
HERE WE HAVE 
HAD THIS BIG GATHERING ALL THESE 
PEOPLE IN LONDON TODAY ANY 
CONCRETE PROGRESS WOULD YOU SAY TO 
PEOPLE WHO SAY IT IS NEARLY 
DIPLOMATIC PLATITUDES 
I SAY I WAS 
IN ALL THE MEETINGS FROM THE 
BEGINNING AND I KNOW ALL THE ACTORS 
I HAVE A D. N. PERSONALLY THE FEELING 
THAT THERE IS NEW COURAGE THERE IS 
THE COURAGE TO GO ON AND THERE IS A 
GOOD CHANCE THAT AT THE END OF THE 
YEAR WE WILL HAVE SOMETHING THAT 
MOVING ON THE POLITICAL AND ALSO ON 
THE GROUND 
A PALESTINIAN STATE WE WE HOPE SO THIS IS THE GOAL 
HALF A 
PALESTINIAN STATE ON THE WEST BANK 
NO I THINK IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT 
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PALESTINIAN 
STATE BOTH ON THE WEST BANK AND IN 
GAZA GAZA THAT WAS THE E. U. EXTERNAL RELATIONS 
COMMISSIONER COMMISSIONER ISTANBUL IN TURKEY STRADDLES BOTH 
ASIA AND EUROPE AND IS ONE OF THE 
WORLD'S MOST RICH CULTURAL SITES 
NEXT WEEK INSPECTORS FROM THE 
WORLD HERITAGE COMMITTEE ARE 
VISITING TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT 
TO LABEL IT A HERITAGE SITE WHICH 
IS IN DANGER THE PROTECTED AREA 
RECEIVED A WORLD HERITAGE LISTING 
TWO DECADES AGO UNESCO HAS ALREADY 
GIVEN THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES A 
WARNING ABOUT HOW THEY MANAGE THE 
SITE AND EXPERTS SAY THERE IS A 
CHANCE THAT ISTANBUL COULD BE 
BLACKLISTED BLACKLISTED IT IS A CITY WITH A SLICE OF 
HISTORY AT EVERY TURN IN ISTANBUL 
MOSQUES MUSEUMS AND PALACES ALL 
JOSTLE FOR SPACE ON THE LANDSCAPE 
IT IS A RICH HERITAGE ONE THAT 
TURKEYS THAT FLOCK TO FEAST THEIR 
EYES ON FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS 
THIS HISTORIC PENINSULA HAS BEEN A 
WORLD HERITAGE SITE IT IS A BADGE 
OF HONOUR FOR UNESCO THAT INCLUDES 
AN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THAT 
THERE ARE SIGNS THAT ISTANBUL HAS 
FAILED TO DO THAT THE CITY WALLS 
SURVIVE FROM THE FIFTH CENTURY AND 
TWO ATTEMPTS TO PROTECT THEM 
DAMAGED THEM FOR EVER THE STONE 
ONLY NEEDED MAKING SAFE INSTEAD 
THIS ANCIENT MONUMENT NOW LOOKS 
BRAND NEW IN PARTS AUTHENTICITY 
HAS BEEN OBLITERATED BENEATH BRICK 
AND CONCRETE IT IS ONE REASON WHY 
UNESCO SHOWED ISTANBUL THE WARNING 
CARD UNESCO WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE WAY ISTANBUL WAS CONSERVING ITS 
HISTORY HERITAGE IT GAVE THE 
CITY TWO YEARS TO IMPROVE BEFORE 
BEEN BLACKLISTED IT IS NOW 
DECISION TIME AND THERE ARE REAL 
FEARS THAT ISTANBUL WILL BE 
RELEGATED RELEGATED ALSO ON THE INSPECTION LIST THIS 
WEEK IS THE STATE OF HUNDREDS OF 
TIMBER HOUSES FROM OTTOMAN TIMES 
MANY ARE CLOSE TO COLLAPSE THESE 
WERE A CENTRAL PART OF ISTANBUL'S 
APPLICATION FOR HERITAGE STATUS IN 
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES MOST WERE THEN LEFT TO 
ROT EVEN WORSE THAN DISAPPEARING 
THROUGH NEGLECT LOCAL ACTIVISTS 
SAY THAT SOME HOUSES HAVE BEEN TO 
MILLETT DELIBERATELY REMOVED 
THIS LADY HAS BEEN CHARTING TO 
STREETS IN THIS DISTRICT HER 
DOCUMENT PROVE THAT THERE WERE THIRTY EIGHT 
TIMBER HOUSES HERE AT JUST TWENTY YEARS 
AGO FEWER THAN HALF ARE STILL 
STANDING THIS ONE WAS DESTROYED 
AFTER UNESCO GAVE ISTANBUL ITS LAST 
WARNING 
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WARNING HERITAGE I THINK IT IS MONEY WHICH 
IS TEARING THEM DOWN INSTEAD OF 
SPENDING MONEY TO RESTORE THE HOUSE 
THEY TEAR IT DOWN AND MAKE A NEW 
HOUSE TURKEY IT HAS ENOUGH MONEY 
TO RESTORE THESE THINGS IT IS NOT 
LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY I 
REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND NOT NOT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN LOST THIS 
NORWEGIAN HERITAGE ENTHUSIAST IS 
WORKING TO RESTORE HIS ISTANBUL 
HOST TO ITS FORMER WOODEN GLORY HE 
IS KEEPING IT AS CLOSE TO THE 
ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE DOWN TO THE 
MATERIALS HE USES SLOWLY THE CITY 
AUTHORITIES ARE CATCHING ON THE 
MUNICIPALITY IS NOW RESTORING FIVE 
TIMBER HOUSES ITSELF INCLUDING TWO 
ON THE SAME STREET 
THERE ARE STILL 
MANY HOUSES TO BE PRESERVED I 
THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE 
POSITIVE THINGS THAT ARE HERE AND 
WITH THESE HOUSES WE NEED TO SHOW 
THAT THIS IS A PROPER RESTORATION 
AND CAN BE DONE WITH MODERATE MEANS 
I THINK MORE PEOPLE PERHAPS RICH 
PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER TO PRESERVE 
THEIR PROPERTIES LIKE THIS AS WELL 
THE CITY COUNCIL BEGAN HIS 
CONSUMMATION MASTERCLASSES AFTER 
THE YELLOW CARD FROM UNESCO IT IS 
NOW TEACHING A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN PAINSTAKING RESTORATION AND 
RECONSTRUCTION OFFICIALS HERE 
CLAIM THAT THE DEMOLITION HAS NOW 
STOPPED AND THE HERITAGE MESSAGE IS 
GETTING THROUGH THERE IS NO REAL 
EXPLANATION FOR THE FAILINGS SO FAR 
THE TOWN PROTECTION 
IS NEW IN TURKEY WE ONLY LEARNED 
ABOUT IT IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WE ARE NOW 
FACING THOSE CONSEQUENCES FROM THAT 
MASS MIGRATION TO THE CITY HAD AN 
IMPACT THE FACT THAT THIS AREA IS 
A PROTECTED ZONE IS VERY IMPORTANT 
FOR US WE CAME TO THIS LATE BUT WE 
HAVE BIG HOPES 
FOR NOW TOURISTS 
ARE OBLIVIOUS TO ALL THIS IF IT 
STUMBLE IS BLACKLISTED BY UNESCO 
IT WILL BE A BLOW TO THE PRESTIGE 
OF THE CITY IF ISTANBUL IS 
BLACKLISTED IT WOULD NOT BE THE 
CAPITAL OF CULTURE FORTY THOUSAND TEN THIS 
HOTEL OWNER TAKES A KEEN INTEREST 
IN CONSERVATION HE TELLS ME HE IS 
WORRIED WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF 
ISTANBUL IS IS THE HERITAGE STATUS 
WHEN ISTANBUL HAS A STATUS THERE IS 
CONTROL WHEN THERE IS NO STATUS 
THERE WILL BE NO CONTROL SO THINGS 
CAN GO A LITTLE BIT WORSE THAN WHAT 
HAS GONE NOW 
WORSE THAN THIS 
WOULD BE DISASTER ISTANBUL APPLIED 
FOR HERITAGE STATUS ITSELF IT 
SIGNED A PLEDGE TO CONSERVE THIS 
SITE FOR THE WORLD AND THE FUTURE 
NOW IT HAS TO PROVE IT IS UP TO 
THAT TASK 
A REMINDER OF OUR TOP STORY GORDON 
BROWN HAS SEEN HIS PARTY SUFFER 
WORST RESULTS IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS 
LABOUR HAS LOST MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED
