MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS AGO THE MOST IMPORTANT BATTLE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD GROUND TO A HALT HERE 
THE D. DAY LANDINGS WERE A HUGE GAMBLE AND VERY NEARLY A DISASTER 
THIS IS THE PLAGE D'OR IN NORMANDY BUT SINCE THE EVENTS OF JUNE SIXTH NINETEEN FORTY FOUR 
IT'S BEEN KNOWN ONLY BY ITS CODE NAME OMAHA BEACH 
IT'S WHERE THE BLOODIEST OF THE FIGHTING HAPPENED AND WHERE IT ALL WENT WRONG 
BUT HISTORIANS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC ARE STILL ARGUING ABOUT THE REASONS WHY 
AND THIS IS AN AMMUNITION TUNNEL AND THAT WOULD BE STACKED HIGH WITH SHELVING FULL OF AMMUNITION 
THE CASUALTY COUNT ON OMAHA BEACH IN RETROSPECT 
WAS MUCH MUCH HIGHER THAN HISTORIANS HAD PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT 
EVERY ONE OF THESE BLACK DOTS IS A DEAD AMERICAN SOLDIER 
STORIES OF THE HEROISM OF THE U. S. SOLDIERS WHO LANDED HERE HAVE BEEN 
TOLD AND RETOLD IN HOLLYWOOD FILMS LIKE SAVING PRIVATE RYAN 
BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED HERE 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR THE MEN WHO HAD TO FIGHT THEIR WAY ASHORE 
AND HOW DID THEY MANAGE TO WIN 
THE MACHINE GUN FIRE WAS GOING C. H. C. H. C. H. C. H. ACROSS THE WATER 
I GOT HIT TWICE WITH MACHINE GUNS IN THE ARM 
AND IT JUST ABOUT TORE MY ARM OFF 
YEAH THERE WERE A LOT OF DEAD BODIES 
THERE WAS NO RADIO COMMUNICATION 
NONE AT ALL 
ABSOLUTELY NONE 
THIS IS A FILM ABOUT TRAINING FOR MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 
AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT MISSION GOES WRONG 
IT'S THE FULL TRUE STORY OF BLOODY OMAHA 
WHEN THE ALLIED SOLDIERS LANDED ON THESE NORMANDY BEACHES 
IT WAS THE FIRST STEP ON THE ROAD TO CAPTURE BERLIN 
AND THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
BUT ON ONE OF THE FIVE INVASION BEACHES IT VERY NEARLY ENDED BEFORE IT EVER BEGAN 
BECAUSE HERE ON OMAHA BEACH THE AMERICAN TROOPS WERE SLAUGHTERED AS THEY CAME ASHORE 
THE AMAZING THING IS THAT SIXTY THREE YEARS LATER 
HISTORIANS AND MILITARY EXPERTS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 
WHY SO MANY MORE MEN DIED ON THIS BEACH THAN ON ANY OTHER 
AFTER AMERICA JOINED THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
THE ALLIES AGREED THAT VICTORY OVER THE NAZIS 
WOULD REQUIRE A MASSIVE INVASION OF GERMAN OCCUPIED FRANCE 
INITIAL PLANNING FOR D. DAY ACTUALLY BEGAN IN MARCH NINETEEN FORTY THREE 
CODE NAMED OPERATION OVERLORD 
IT WAS TO BE A JOINT BRITISH AMERICAN AND CANADIAN MISSION 
AND THE BIGGEST AMPHIBIOUS INVASION EVER ATTEMPTED 
ON NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH STALIN ROOSEVELT AND CHURCHILL MET IN TEHRAN 
AND DECIDED THAT OVERLORD MUST BE THEIR MAIN PRIORITY FOR NINETEEN FORTY FOUR 
GENERAL DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER WAS APPOINTED SUPREME COMMANDER 
AND GENERAL BERNARD MONTGOMERY COMMANDER OF LAND FORCES 
THE D. DAY INVASION WOULD BE BASED ON SURPRISE 
AND ON DEVASTATING FIRE POWER 
AND MUCH OF THAT FIRE POWER WOULD COME FROM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC 
IN NORTH AMERICA ALMOST TWO MILLION AMERICAN AND CANADIAN TROOPS WERE ASSEMBLED 
ALTHOUGH NO ONE WAS TOLD EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING 
AMONG THEM WAS NINETEEN YEAR OLD PRIVATE FIRST CLASS RAY TOLLEFSON 
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO EUROPE 
WE GOT TO THE PORT AND THERE WE SEE THE QUEEN ELIZABETH 
WHICH ONCE AGAIN TOLD US THAT WE HAD TO BE GOING TO THE BRITISH ISLES 
AND WE DOCKED AT LIVERPOOL AND ALL THE WORKMEN THE GUYS ON THE DOCK 
WERE YELLING FOR CIGARETTES CIGARETTES YANKS 
AND YOU GOT ANY GUM CHUM AND ALL THAT 
SO WE WERE THROWING THEM CIGARETTES 
AND THEN WE BOARDED A TRAIN AND WE WENT ON TO BUDE IN CORNWALL 
AND IN CORNWALL THEY TOLD US WE WERE GOING TO BE BILLETED IN PRIVATE HOMES 
ON I THINK IT WAS TWENTY ONE KILLERTON ROAD AND IT WAS A FAMILY THING 
IT WAS NEAT LIVING IN TOWN 
PUB ACROSS THE STREET BANK ACROSS THE STREET 
FISH AND CHIPS UP THE STREET IT WAS REAL NEAT 
THE SCALE OF THE D. DAY PLANS WAS INCREDIBLE 
BY APRIL NINETEEN FORTY FOUR TWO MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND TROOPS WERE ENCAMPED IN ENGLAND 
BY MAY THE FIGURE WAS WELL OVER THREE MILLION THOUSAND 
THE WHOLE OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND WAS ONE HUGE MILITARY TRAINING CAMP 
THE JOINT AMERICAN BRITISH AND CANADIAN MISSION WOULD BE ONE OF THE ALLIES' GREATEST TRIUMPHS 
BUT MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS LATER HISTORIANS ARE GAINING A NEW UNDERSTANDING 
INTO HOW IT MIGHT HAVE ENDED IN DISASTER 
HISTORIAN SIMON TREW TEACHES AT THE ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY SANDHURST 
AND IS ALSO A D. DAY EXPERT 
HE'S TRYING TO DISCOVER 
HOW POTENTIAL FAILURE ON OMAHA BEACH WAS TURNED INTO A VICTORY 
THE ALLIED INVASION OF NORMANDY WAS TO TAKE PLACE ACROSS A BROAD FRONT 
RIGHT ALONG THE CALVADOS COASTLINE 
AND THE BOTTOM OF THE COTENTIN PENINSULA 
IT'S A BREADTH OF ABOUT EIGHTY K. M. OR ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILES ALTOGETHER 
THE PLAN WAS AN AMBITIOUS ONE 
THE ALLIES WOULD LAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND MEN AT FIVE DIFFERENT ASSAULT BEACHES 
THE BRITISH WANTED THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE 
THE U. S. PLANNERS WANTED TIME FOR AN AERIAL BOMBARDMENT 
THE NORMANDY INVASION IS A FUNCTION OF A COMPROMISE 
THE WHOLE THING IS A FUNCTION OF COMPROMISE 
IF I GAVE A MILITARY PROBLEM TO THE BRITISH RIGHT 
NOT JUST AN AMPHIBIOUS OPERATION ANY MILITARY PROBLEM 
THEY WOULD COME UP WITH ONE SOLUTION 
IF I GAVE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM TO AMERICAN MILITARY LEADERS 
THEY WOULD COME UP WITH A VERY DIFFERENT SOLUTION 
NOW LET'S PUT 'EM BOTH ON THE SAME BATTLEFIELD AND SAY GEE ALL RIGHT COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR THIS 
YOU GET A COMPROMISE PLAN 
AND THIS COMPROMISE PLAN WOULD HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SOLDIERS LANDING ON OMAHA BEACH 
THE ALLIES KNEW THAT IF AN INVASION OF THIS SIZE WAS TO HAVE A HOPE OF SUCCEEDING 
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT NEEDED TO BE METICULOUSLY PLANNED 
AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY HAD TO DO 
WAS GATHER INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE NORMANDY COASTLINE 
IN LONDON THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ASKED THE B. B. C. TO BROADCAST AN APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC 
TO SEND IN ANY PICTURES OR PHOTOGRAPHS THEY HAD OF THE FRENCH COASTLINE 
THIRTY THOUSAND POSTCARDS AND PHOTOS OF FAMILY HOLIDAYS IN FRANCE ARRIVED IN THE NEXT POST 
IN TOTAL THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN SENT IN TEN MILLION IMAGES 
ALLOWING THE ALLIES TO BUILD UP AN INCREDIBLY DETAILED PICTURE OF THE COASTLINE 
THE D. DAY PLANNERS SEEMED TO THINK OF EVERYTHING 
THE INVADING ARMIES WOULD HAVE TO BRING THOUSANDS OF TANKS AND OTHER HEAVY VEHICLES WITH THEM 
SO THEY HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SAND WAS HARD ENOUGH FOR THEM TO DRIVE OVER WITHOUT GETTING STUCK 
BUT HOW WOULD THEY FIND OUT 
THE INCREDIBLE SOLUTION WAS A ROYAL NAVY X. CRAFT 
ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF JANUARY NINETEEN FORTY FOUR A MIDGET SUBMARINE CREPT ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL 
UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS IT SURFACED JUST OFF THE NORMANDY COASTLINE 
MAJOR LOGAN SCOTT BODEN AND SERGEANT BRUCE OGDEN SMITH 
SWAM ASHORE AND TOOK SAMPLES OF THE BEACH FOR ANALYSIS BACK HOME 
IT'S A FANTASTIC STORY 
THEY CREPT ASHORE AT NIGHT RIGHT UNDER THE GERMANS' NOSES 
TO CHECK THAT THE SAND WOULD TAKE THE TANKS 
ACROSS BRITAIN THE D. DAY TROOPS WERE PUT INTO TOUGH TRAINING CAMPS TO BUILD UP PHYSICAL FITNESS 
I DON'T THINK THERE WASN'T A DAY WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE A SPEED MARCH OR RUN AT LEAST FIVE TEN MILES 
THAT WAS JUST LIKE GETTING OUT OF BED 
THE ELITE U. S. RANGERS WERE SENT ON EXTRA TRAINING 
FOR A TOP SECRET MISSION WITH LADDERS BORROWED FROM THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE 
YOU KNEW IT WOULD BE SOMETHING IN THE LINE OF HIGH HILLS OR CLIFFS 
OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE THERE 
WE SET UP TRAINING DOWN IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT 
WHERE THERE'S SOME ENORMOUS CLIFFS UP TO TWO HUNDRED F. T. IN HEIGHT 
THEY DROPPED ROPE LADDERS DOWN YOU'D GO SCURRYING UP THE CLIFFS 
AND THEN YOU'D GET UP TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS 
AND THEY'D PUT A ROPE AROUND YOUR SHOULDERS 
AND ROUND YOUR LEG AND DROP YOU DOWN 
AND YOU'D GRAB IT LIKE THIS IT'LL STOP YOU 
THAT WAS FUN 
YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE CROWD 
DOING WHATEVER YOU'RE TOLD TO DO AND THAT'S THE WAY YOU'RE TRAINED 
YOU'RE NOT TRAINED TO START ANALYSING AND SUGGESTING YOU DO THIS OR THAT 
YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU'RE TOLD AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO 
WITH SO MANY TROOPS ASSEMBLED IN BRITAIN 
THE ALLIES KNEW THEIR PREPARATIONS WOULDN'T REMAIN A COMPLETE SECRET 
HITLER KNEW THE ALLIES WERE PLANNING AN INVASION OF EUROPE 
HE'D ORDERED THE BUILDING OF A MASSIVE LINE OF CONCRETE GUN POSITIONS 
LIKE THIS ONE ALONG THE COAST OF OCCUPIED EUROPE 
FROM NORWAY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE SPANISH BORDER 
THE NAZIS BOASTED THAT IT WOULD BE THE GREATEST LINE OF FORTIFICATIONS MILITARY HISTORY HAD EVER SEEN 
THE GERMANS KNEW 
THAT THE ALLIES WERE GOING TO INVADE NORTHWEST EUROPE 
FROM THE ALLIED PERSPECTIVE THE KEY ISSUE WAS NOT THAT THEY KNEW 
BUT THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHERE 
THE GERMAN HIGH COMMAND WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHERE THEY THOUGHT THE ALLIED INVASION WOULD COME 
BUT MANY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD COME AT CALAIS 
THE PAS DE CALAIS MUCH FURTHER TO THE NORTH 
BECAUSE IT'S A NARROWER PART OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL 
LESS THAN THIRTY MILES AT ITS NARROWEST 
OF COURSE THE ALLIES KNEW THAT THE GERMANS WOULD BE EXPECTING THIS 
THE ALLIES NOW SET ABOUT FOOLING HITLER INTO THINKING THE INVASION WOULD TAKE PLACE SOMEWHERE ELSE 
DISTRACTING HIS TROOPS FROM THE REAL INVASION SITE ON THE NORMANDY BEACHES 
IN BRITAIN A TOP SECRET GROUP CALLED THE LONDON CONTROLLING SECTION 
BEGAN ONE OF THE BEST DECEPTION PLANS IN HISTORY 
ENTIRE ARMIES WERE INVENTED TO FOOL THE GERMANS 
DUMMY TANKS WERE SET UP IN FIELDS AND MOVED ABOUT AT NIGHT 
SO THAT THE GERMANS WOULD BELIEVE 
THEY WERE GATHERING FOR AN INVASION VIA CALAIS 
MOCK AIRFIELDS WERE MADE MORE REALISTIC BY SPRAYING WEEDKILLER TO MAKE WHEEL TRACKS IN THE GRASS 
CANVAS LANDING CRAFT WERE MOORED OFF THE COAST 
IF WE COULD KEEP THE D. DAY SECRET INTACT 
THE GERMANS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FOCUS THEIR DEFENCES ON THE POINT OF ATTACK 
AND THAT WAS THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE D. DAY PLAN 
USING DOUBLE AGENTS M. I FIVE ALSO SENT MESSAGES TO GERMANY ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF FUSAG 
THE FIRST U. S. ARMY GROUP ON STANDBY IN KENT AND THE SOUTHEAST OF ENGLAND 
TO INVADE AT THE SHORTEST ROUTE ACROSS THE CHANNEL TO CALAIS 
FUSAG DID NOT EXIST BUT IT DISTRACTED THE GERMANS FROM THESE BEACHES 
THE ALLIED DECEPTION WORKED REMARKABLY WELL 
THE GERMAN HIGH COMMAND CONTINUED TO THINK EVEN AFTER D. DAY 
THAT THE ALLIES WERE GOING TO LAND ELSEWHERE 
THE DECEPTION WAS SO THOROUGH THAT THEY BECAME CONVINCED BECAUSE OF THE DECEPTION 
THAT THE NORMANDY LANDINGS THE ACTUAL D. DAY LANDINGS WERE MERELY A FEIGN 
AND THAT THE MAIN LANDINGS WOULD OCCUR LATER SOMEWHERE ELSE 
THAT'S HOW GOOD THE DECEPTION PLAN WAS 
THE GERMAN DEFENCES WERE STRONGEST IN THE AREA AROUND CALAIS 
WHERE HITLER WAS CONVINCED THE INVASION WOULD TAKE PLACE 
KNOWING THIS THE ALLIES DECIDED INSTEAD TO ATTACK THE LESS OBVIOUS 
AND CRUCIALLY LESS WELL DEFENDED NORMANDY COAST 
WHAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE 
AND IT WOULD BE A CHANGE THAT WOULD AFFECT THE TROOPS LANDING ON OMAHA BEACH 
THEY DID A STUDY OF THE ENTIRE COAST OF FRANCE AND THEY SELECTED THE NORMANDY INVASION 
HOWEVER WHAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THEY MADE THAT DECISION IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE 
IN THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY THREE IN DECEMBER OF NINETEEN FORTY THREE 
A GUY NAMED HITLER PUT A GUY NAMED ROMMEL IN CHARGE OF THE WESTERN WALL 
HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE DEFENCE OF FRANCE 
NICKNAMED THE DESERT FOX FIELD MARSHAL ERWIN ROMMEL 
HAD FOUGHT THE BRITISH TO A STANDSTILL IN AFRICA IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
HE NOW SET ABOUT TURNING THE BEACHES OF NORMANDY INTO WHAT HE CALLED A KILLING ZONE 
IN FEBRUARY OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR ROMMEL CAME DOWN TO THE SECTOR OF THE FRONT CALLED GRANDCAMP 
WHAT WE LATER CALLED OMAHA BEACH 
HE GOT ON TOP OF THE BLUFFS OVERLOOKING OMAHA BEACH AND HE SAID 
THIS IS WHERE THE FATE OF EUROPE WILL BE DECIDED 
AND AT THAT POINT HE DECIDED TO HEAVILY REINFORCE OMAHA BEACH 
HE CHANGED THE CONCEPT FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE DEFENCE 
HE STARTED POURING CONCRETE HE PUT IN BUNKERS HE PUT IN OBSTACLES WIRE MINEFIELDS ETC ETC 
SO WHEN THE DECISION WAS MADE FOR NORMANDY IT WAS NOT NEARLY AS WELL DEFENDED AS IT WAS A YEAR LATER 
THE ACTUAL STRENGTH OF ROMMEL'S DEFENCES ON D. DAY IS STILL A KEY ISSUE FOR HISTORIANS 
HERE ON OMAHA BEACH THE WHOLE AREA WAS BY NOW COVERED IN GERMAN FORTIFICATIONS 
LOTS OF THEM UNDERGROUND 
THEY HAD ARTILLERY MACHINE GUN NESTS BUNKERS LIVING ACCOMMODATION 
ALL HIDDEN AWAY IN THE FOLDS OF THESE HILLS 
I'M ACTUALLY WALKING ALONG THE LINE OF ONE OF THE GERMAN TRENCHES NOW 
BUT THESE WERE FILLED IN AFTER D. DAY 
SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT THESE PLACES WERE REALLY LIKE 
BUT A FEW MILES OVER THERE IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY 
MILITARY ENTHUSIAST GARY STERNE HAS MADE AN AMAZING DISCOVERY 
AN EXTENSIVE GERMAN GUN BATTERY NEAR THE VILLAGE OF GRANDCAMP MAISY JUST WEST OF OMAHA BEACH 
BURIED SINCE THE END OF THE WAR ITS RE EMERGENCE OVER SIXTY YEARS LATER CREATED NEWS HEADLINES 
JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE SIZE OF THE GUNS INVOLVED 
THIS IS ONE OF THE ONE FIFTY FIVE M. M. SHELLS THAT WE'VE FOUND HERE 
THIS ONE'S LIVE IT'S GONNA GO IN A HOLE AND DISAPPEAR FOREVER 
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE ONES THAT WAS FOUND JUST HERE 
STERNE HAS SPENT MANY MONTHS UNEARTHING THIS SITE 
SO FAR HE'S FOUND SIX LARGE GERMAN GUN POSITIONS 
ALTHOUGH THEY'RE SEVERAL MILES AWAY 
HIS THEORY IS THAT THEY COULD HAVE DROPPED MASSIVE SHELLS ON OMAHA BEACH 
BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS FACED BY HISTORIANS IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND 
WHY THINGS WENT SO BADLY WRONG ON OMAHA BEACH 
IS GETTING A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE GERMAN SIDE OF THE STORY 
THEY TOO SUFFERED HEAVY CASUALTIES AND MANY OF THEIR OFFICIAL RECORDS WERE DESTROYED IN THE WAR 
HISTORIAN SIMON TREW IS EAGER TO FIND OUT 
IF THE RECENTLY UNEARTHED GERMAN BATTERY AT MAISY 
CAN HELP SHED NEW LIGHT ON THE EVENTS OF D. DAY 
HIS INITIAL RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT MUCH OF THE WORK DONE AT THE MAISY BATTERY 
WAS COMPLETED BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE PLANNING FOR D. DAY IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE 
AND THE ACTUAL INVASION IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR 
SO THIS IS ONE OF THE ONE FIFTY FIVE M. M. GUN MOUNTS THAT WE'VE FOUND 
EVERYTHING AROUND IT WAS BURIED SO IF YOU GET THE IDEA OF THE HEIGHT HERE 
ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CONCRETE HERE YEAH IT WAS ABOVE 
WE CLEARED THIS YES BUT IF YOU TAKE ANOTHER FOOT OF SOIL ON HERE 
AND LOOK AT THE DISTANCE IT WOULD HAVE COVERED OVER HERE THIS WAS ALL BURIED 
THE GUNS ARE BIG THINGS YOU KNOW THEY'RE A LARGE SIZED GUN 
THE RANGE ESTIMATED BY THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS AFTER THE BATTLE WAS THIRTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED YARDS 
AND HOW FAR IS OMAHA BEACH 
ER IT'S ABOUT SEVEN MILES SEVEN AND A HALF MILES SO I THINK 
BUT COULD THESE GUNS BE THE REASON SO MANY DIED ON OMAHA BEACH 
THE REDISCOVERY OF MAISY BATTERY OFFERS A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT 
JUST HOW STRONG THE GERMAN DEFENCES ALONG THIS PART OF THE NORMANDY COASTLINE WERE 
THE ALLIES KNEW THERE WERE LARGE ARTILLERY GUNS HERE 
BUT GARY HAS ALSO UNCOVERED MANY UNDERGROUND BUILDINGS 
AND THIS IS AN AMMUNITION TUNNEL 
YEAH SO WHAT YOU'VE GOT ON THE LEFT HERE IS TWO BIG ROOMS WHICH WOULD'VE HELD THE EXPLOSIVES 
THE CHARGES THE CHARGES IN THEMSELVES 
AND THAT WOULD BE STACKED HIGH WITH STEEL SHELVING FULL OF AMMUNITION O. K. 
SO THIS IS THE COMMAND CENTRE FOR THE ENTIRE MAISY BATTERY SITE YES 
IT'S ORGANISING EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON ON THE SITE O. K. 
GARY BELIEVES THAT UP TO FOUR HUNDRED GERMAN SOLDIERS WERE BASED HERE 
AND HE'S ALSO UNEARTHED PERSONNEL BUILDINGS OFFICES A MEDICAL POST 
AND TWO MILES OF TRENCHES WITHIN A ONE HUNDRED EIGHT ACRE SITE 
SO OVER HERE COVERING THE ENTRANCE STEPS DOWN THAT WE'VE JUST WALKED DOWN NOW 
YOU HAVE A STEEL PLATE AND A HINGED DOOR ON IT 
AND MOUNTED INTO THERE IS A SMALL MACHINE GUN 
WOULD BE COVERING THE WHOLE OF THAT AREA 
SO A MAN COULD LOOK THROUGH A PAIR OF GOGGLES UP THERE AND FIRE AT ANYBODY COMING 
THE IDEA WAS THAT THIS WAS MEANT TO BE A STRONG POINT 
NOBODY COULD ATTACK IT NOBODY COULD GET INSIDE IT 
EVERYTHING HEAVILY DEFENDED THEY COULD FIRE AT PEOPLE AND KEEP THEM AT BAY 
IT'S ONLY TWO OR THREE METRES TO THE TOP OF THE STEPS ABSOLUTELY 
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY HITLER THOUGHT THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD LAST TILL THE LAST BULLET YEAH 
ON THE LEFT AN ESCAPE HATCH FOR AN AMMUNITION STORE 
BUT AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH IN OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS 
SIMON IS NOT YET CONVINCED THAT THE MAISY GUNS QUITE HAD THE FIRING RANGE TO REACH OMAHA BEACH 
BUT HE BELIEVES THAT THE SITE IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE 
OF HOW ROMMEL'S INFLUENCE HAD TRANSFORMED THE GERMAN POSITIONS ALONG THE COAST 
THE WORK DONE BY ROMMEL'S TROOPS IN LATE NINETEEN FORTY THREE AND EARLY NINETEEN FORTY FOUR COMPLETELY CHANGED THINGS 
THE DEFENCES OF LOWER NORMANDY ON D. DAY WERE MUCH MUCH STRONGER THAN THE DEFENCES HAD BEEN 
EVEN A MATTER OF MONTHS EARLIER 
MAISY PROVIDES A NICE ILLUSTRATION OF HOW THIS WORK HAD BEEN DONE 
MAKING THINGS MUCH MORE ROBUST MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE 
MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN ALLIED BOMBARDMENTS 
THAN HAD BEEN THE CASE ONLY MONTHS EARLIER 
AS D. DAY APPROACHED THE MEN PREPARING FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST MILITARY OPERATIONS EVER ATTEMPTED 
WERE TRANSPORTED DOWN TO THE PORTS ALONG THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND 
MOST OF THEM STILL DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE SETTING OUT TO DO 
THERE WAS A MARSHALLING AREA ALONG THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND 
I ESTIMATE IT WAS MAYBE TEN MILES DEEP IN FROM THE COASTLINE 
AND MY RECOLLECTION IS THERE WAS NO TELEPHONE CALLS PERMITTED IN OR OUT 
NO MAIL PERMITTED IN OR OUT NO TRANSPORTATION IN OR OUT 
WELL THE INTERESTING WORD WAS ER BIGOT 
THERE WAS SECRET MOST SECRET TOP SECRET BUT THE TOP OF ALL WAS BIGOT 
AND THAT WAS THE INVASION PLANS 
WE KNEW WE WERE GOING OVER INTO FRANCE OR THE NETHERLANDS 
OR SOMEWHERE WE WERE GOING BACK TO WHAT THEY CALLED THE SECOND FRONT 
WE WERE GOING TO BE PART OF THE SECOND FRONT 
AND WE KNEW WE FELT WE WERE GONNA BE LEADING IT 
I CAN'T RECALL ANYBODY EVER SAYING TO ONE ANOTHER 
I WONDER WHY WE'RE DOING THIS 
WE JUST KNEW WE WERE GONNA GO INTO COMBAT 
AND ER I GUESS WE WERE IDIOTIC ENOUGH TO LOOK FORWARD TO IT 
WHEN YOU SAY WELL WERE YOU AFRAID OF CLIMBING THE CLIFFS 
OR WERE YOU AFRAID TO GO IN ON THE INVASION 
OR YOU WERE AFRAID TO DO THIS OR THAT 
WE WERE GOING TO DO IT 
IT WAS A NUMBERS GAME SOME WERE GONNA SURVIVE AND SOME WEREN'T GOING TO SURVIVE 
WHAT THE AMERICAN TROOPS HEADING FOR OMAHA BEACH DIDN'T KNOW 
WAS THAT THEY WOULD DIE IN FAR GREATER NUMBERS THAN THE TROOPS ON ANY OF THE OTHER BEACHES 
BUT THE EXACT REASON FOR THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN HOTLY DEBATED 
IT HAD BEEN SUGGESTED BY SOME THAT THE ALLIES FAILED TO FULLY RECOGNISE 
THE STRENGTH OF THE GERMAN FORCES AT OMAHA BEACH 
BY THE END OF D. DAY CAPTURED GERMAN SOLDIERS WERE IDENTIFIED AS BEING FROM THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SECOND INFANTRY DIVISION 
THIS WAS A CONSIDERABLE SURPRISE AS THEY HADN'T BEEN LISTED BY ALLIED INTELLIGENCE AS BEING THERE 
THE QUESTION FOR SOME HISTORIANS IS 
COULD EXTRA GERMAN TROOPS AND ARTILLERY THAT THE ALLIES DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT 
BE THE REASON SO MANY DIED ON OMAHA BEACH 
THIS GERMAN MAP WAS CAPTURED AFTER D. DAY 
BUT HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE U. S. NATIONAL ARCHIVE 
THE HISTORIAN WHO FOUND IT IS CONVINCED IT HELPS SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF BLOODY OMAHA 
ONE REASON THAT THE U. S. CASUALTIES AT OMAHA BEACH WERE SO HIGH 
WAS THE PRESENCE OF MUCH MORE ARTILLERY THAN THE U. S. ARMY EXPECTED 
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THE PRESENCE OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SECOND INFANTRY DIVISION 
THEY DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THE PRESENCE OF THEIR ARTILLERY 
THAT DIVISION HAD A FULL REGIMENT OF ARTILLERY 
THEY HAD THIRTY TONNES OF AMMUNITION IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE BEACH 
ZALOGA BELIEVES THESE EXTRA FIELD ARTILLERY UNITS 
WOULD HAVE ENABLED THE GERMANS TO DROP SHELLS ONTO ANY PART OF OMAHA BEACH 
FROM A FEW MILES INLAND WITHOUT BEING SEEN 
AND ALL THESE LITTLE SQUARES WITH ALL THESE LITTLE NAMES 
ARE A TRICK THAT ARTILLERY MEN USE 
TO DIRECT FIRE VERY QUICKLY AND VERY ACCURATELY 
WHEN D. DAY OCCURRED ALL THE FORWARD OBSERVERS HAD TO DO 
IS CALL IN THIS NAME AND SAY I NEED TEN ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION 
I NEED ONE HUNDRED ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION ON THIS SPOT 
VERY QUICKLY VERY EFFICIENT VERY DEADLY FOR THE AMERICAN TROOPS ON THAT BEACH 
SO COULDN'T THAT BE THE ANSWER THEN 
IT WAS A FAILURE OF INTELLIGENCE THEY UNDERESTIMATED THE STRENGTH OF THE TROOPS HERE 
I DON'T THINK SO THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE ANALYSTS CALCULATED 
THAT THERE'D BE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND GERMANS HERE AT OMAHA BEACH ON D. DAY 
AND I THINK THAT FIGURE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY CLOSE 
NOW THEY DIDN'T GET QUITE THE RIGHT FORMATION 
THEY MISSED THE MOVE FORWARD OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SECOND INFANTRY DIVISION TO THIS AREA OF NORMANDY 
BUT I DON'T THINK ACTUALLY THAT MATTERS A GREAT DEAL 
DURING D. DAY THERE WERE SOMETHING LIKE SIX HUNDRED GERMANS IN THE BEACH FRONT DEFENCES 
AND THEY'D GOT MAYBE ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED REINFORCEMENTS 
SO TWO THOUSAND MEN ALTOGETHER 
BUT THEY WERE VERY WELL ARMED LOTS OF MACHINE GUNS MORTARS PLENTIFUL ARTILLERY SUPPORT 
THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THEY'D GOT DOMINATING POSITIONS 
FROM THE BLUFFS FROM THESE CLIFFS OVERLOOKING OMAHA BEACH 
THEY'VE GOT SUPERB FIELDS OF FIRE THEY CAN DOMINATE THE BEACH O. K. 
SO THEY CAN TRANSFORM THIS AREA INTO A KILLING ZONE 
AND IT WOULD BE THESE DOMINATING BLUFFS THAT WOULD HOLD THE REAL KEY TO ATTACKING OMAHA BEACH 
ACROSS THE CHANNEL THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS WHO WOULD HAVE TO LAND HERE WERE TOLD TO GET READY 
BY THE END OF D. DAY THOUSANDS OF THEM WOULD BE CASUALTIES 
AND I THINK IT WAS ON I'M GUESSING IT WAS A JUNE FIRST 
WE STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE GONNA GO 
BUT THEY PUT US ON TRUCKS 
AND I REMEMBER A CANVAS WAS OFF TWENTY FIVE TONNE TRUCKS 
AND THEY TRUCKED US DOWN TO A PORT 
AND THAT PORT HAPPENED TO BE WEYMOUTH 
PUT ON LANDING CRAFT AND TAKEN OUT TO THE MOTHER SHIP 
STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE GOING 
ON JUNE FOURTH AFTER A TWENTY FOUR HOUR DELAY DUE TO BAD WEATHER EISENHOWER GAVE THE ORDER TO DEPART 
THE INVASION FLEET OF SEVEN THOUSAND VESSELS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MEN AND SEVERAL MILLION ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WAS READY 
THE PLANNING WAS OVER THE INVASION OF EUROPE HAD BEGUN 
I COUNTED ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN IN THE LINE THAT I WAS IN OF VESSELS GOING ACROSS THE CHANNEL 
ON MY LEFT HAND SIDE THERE WAS ANOTHER COLUMN OF SHIPS IT WAS FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON 
ON THIS SIDE ANOTHER COLUMN OF SHIPS HORIZON TO HORIZON 
I MEAN THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE AS TO THE SIZE OF IT AND THE 
THE TERM THAT I USE IS IT'S LIKE A COILED SPRING 
AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THAT WAS GONNA STOP THIS 
SOME PEOPLE WERE READING HAD STUFF TO READ AND THAT THERE 
AND MAYBE SOME WERE WRITING LETTERS BUT ER 
I WASN'T IN THE MOOD TO WRITE LETTERS THEN 
THEY HAD A CHURCH SERVICE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF PEOPLE WANTED 
BUT IT NEVER GOT TO BE A BIG THING 
BUT A LOT OF THE FELLOWS THAT WANTED THAT THERE WELL 
THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IF THEY WANTED TO DO THAT 
BUT THERE WAS DEFINITE QUIETNESS AND RESOLVE 
AND YOU KNEW THE YOU KNEW IT WAS A NUMBERS GAME 
YOU KNEW SOME OF US AREN'T GONNA BE AROUND 
ALTHOUGH THE MEN EXPECTED THE INVASION TO BE DIFFICULT 
THOSE HEADING FOR OMAHA BEACH WERE IN FOR A PARTICULARLY ROUGH TIME 
OMAHA BEACH WAS POTENTIALLY A NIGHTMARE TO ASSAULT 
AND THE AMERICANS REALISED THIS 
IF WE LOOK AT THE SHAPE OF THE BEACH 
BOTH IN THAT DIRECTION AND ACROSS IT 
WE CAN SEE ALL SORTS OF CHALLENGES 
LANDING AT ANYTHING OTHER THAN HIGH TIDE 
IS GONNA LEAVE YOU EXPOSED ON THE BEACH OVER HUNDREDS OF METRES OF OPEN SAND 
IF YOU GET TO THE TOP OF THE BEACH 
WE CAN SEE THIS LONG LINE OF WHAT THE AMERICANS CALL BLUFFS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED F. T. HIGH 
THE GERMANS HAD DEFENCE POSITIONS ON THE TOPS DOTTED ALONG THE SIX THOUSAND OR SEVEN THOUSAND METRES OF THE COASTLINE 
THE BEACH IS ALSO CURVED 
THIS MEANS THAT FIRE FROM THIS END WHAT WE CALL ENFILADE GRAZING FIRE 
FIRED AT A LOW LEVEL 
THE ROUNDS WILL GO A LONG WAY UNTIL THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH SOMETHING 
SO A REALLY DIFFICULT PLACE FOR THE AMERICANS TO ASSAULT ON D. DAY 
THEY SAID ALL RANGERS TO YOUR STATIONS 
AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
SO WE GOT ALL OUR GEAR TOGETHER AND WENT TO OUR STATIONS 
WHERE WE WERE ASSIGNED TO GET INTO A SPECIFIC LANDING CRAFT 
AND WE WERE LIKE CORKS JUST LIKE THIS AND THE CORK GOES 
THE LANDING CRAFT IS FLYING UP AND DOWN IN THE WATER 
GUYS WERE GETTING SEASICK 
WATER WAS COMING OVER AND WE WERE BAILING WITH OUR HELMETS AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
IT WAS ROUGH AND YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING THE CRAFT 
THEY WERE NOT BIG AND WE REALLY BOUNCED AROUND IN THAT THING THERE 
AND IN FACT ONE WAS TIPPED OVER FROM F. COMPANY 
A NUMBER OF THE FELLOWS DROWNED 
THE PLAN WAS THAT FROM SIX THIRTY A M. THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND MEN COMPLETE WITH TANKS AND ARTILLERY 
WOULD LAND IN SUCCESSIVE WAVES IN A PRE DETERMINED ORDER ALONG THE LENGTH OF OMAHA BEACH 
AN AMPHIBIOUS INVASION IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT MILITARY OPERATIONS 
THINK ABOUT IT IF THINGS BEGIN TO GO WRONG YOU CAN'T RETREAT 
THE SUCCESS OF THE INVASION PLAN WAS BASED ON GETTING THE TROOPS OFF THE BEACH AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
ROMMEL'S PLAN WAS TO KEEP THEM THERE 
WEEKS BEFORE D. DAY THOUSANDS OF OBSTACLES WERE PLACED IN THE SAND 
HUGE METAL GATES BOOBY TRAPS AND METAL CONSTRUCTIONS CALLED CZECH HEDGEHOGS 
THEY WERE DESIGNED TO BLOW UP THE LANDING CRAFT AND SLOW DOWN TROOPS 
CREATING A KILLING ZONE ON THE BEACH 
THE MAJORITY OF THE KILLING WILL TAKE PLACE ON THE BEACH 
YOU WANNA GET OFF OF THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
TO MAKE SURE THE MEN COULD GET ACROSS 
AND OFF THE BEACH QUICKLY A MASSIVE AERIAL BOMBARDMENT WAS PLANNED 
IT WAS DESIGNED TO TAKE OUT THE GERMAN POSITIONS DUG IN ALL ALONG THOSE HILLS 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY AMERICAN BOMBERS ASSEMBLED OVER BRITAIN AND HEADED TOWARDS NORMANDY 
ONCE THERE THE PLAN GAVE THEM LESS THAN THIRTY MINUTES 
TO DROP THIRTEEN HUNDRED TONNES OF BOMBS ON THE OMAHA BEACH DEFENCES 
OUT AT SEA THE NAVY WERE ALSO TO BOMBARD THE COAST WITH THEIR GUNS 
THE IDEA IS THAT BEFORE THE TROOPS GO ASHORE THE GERMAN DEFENDERS WILL 
HAVE BEEN HAMMERED FROM THE AIR AND FROM THE SEA 
THEY WILL HAVE BEEN PUMMELLED BY A RELENTLESS BOMBARDMENT 
LASTING ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE AMERICANS GO ASHORE AT OMAHA BEACH 
WELL MAN WHEN YOU WATCHED IT COMING IN IT WAS A MAJOR FIREWORKS THERE 
LIKE THE BIG BATTLESHIPS AND CRUISERS 
AND THE ROCKET LAUNCHERS 
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY COULD RUN OFF ABOUT A DOZEN AT A TIME YOU KNOW 
AND JUST SCADS OF THOSE GOING UP THERE THAT YOU FELT OH BOY THIS IS GONNA BE A CAKEWALK YOU KNOW 
THE AERIAL BOMBARDMENT OF OMAHA BEACH WAS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE CORE PLAN 
VERY SIMPLY PUT THE QUANTITY OF BOMBS DESCENDING FROM THE SKY 
AGAINST THE GERMAN DEFENDERS 
WAS THOUGHT TO BE SO INTENSE THAT NOBODY COULD LIVE THROUGH IT 
AND THEN ALONG ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I THINK 
WE HEAR THIS BIG ROAR OF THE BOMBERS 
THE THE B. TWENTY FOURS 
TONNES AND TONNES OF SHELLS 
AND WE SAID OH HUH NOW THEY'RE GONNA GET IT YOU KNOW 
IT WAS JUST OVERWHELMING TO SEE THE NUMBER I NEVER 
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THAT MANY PLANES BEING IN THE WORLD IN THAT ONE SPOT 
THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE WING TO WING 
IT WAS CLAIMED THAT AMERICAN PRECISION BOMBING COULD DROP A BOMB INTO A PICKLE BARREL 
AND SOLDIERS WERE ASSURED THAT THE GERMAN BEACH DEFENCES WOULD BE COMPLETELY HAMMERED 
ONE SENIOR COMMANDER EVEN TOLD HIS TROOPS THAT THEY'D HAVE FRONT ROW SEATS AT THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS IT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER 
UNITED STATES HAD A DOCTRINE THAT WAS CALLED PRECISION BOMBING THEY LIKED PRECISION BOMBING 
AND THEY BRAGGED THAT THEY COULD PUT A BOMB IN A PICKLE BARREL FROM TWENTY ZERO ZERO ZERO F. T. 
THEY HAD NOWHERE NEAR THAT KIND OF ACCURACY THAT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE 
AND THE ACTUAL MORNING OF THE INVASION 
THE COASTLINE OF NORMANDY WAS JUST A BALL OF FIRE 
JUST FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON JUST FIRE 
CONSTANT AND THAT WAS THE BOMBARDMENT THAT WAS GOING ON 
AND THERE'S NOTHING GONNA SURVIVE IN THAT 
OR AT LEAST THAT WAS THE THOUGHT 
WELL WHEN YOU GOT CLOSE TO SHORE 
YOU FOUND THAT WASN'T TRUE BUT YOU COULDN'T TURN BACK 
AMERICANS NEEDED DAYLIGHT 
DAYLIGHT PRECISION BOMBING 
SO THEY GAVE THEM ACTUALLY LESS THAN THIRTY MINUTES TO BOMB THE BEACHES THERE 
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THEY MISSED 
THE AERIAL BOMBARDMENT WAS A COMPLETE FAILURE 
THE GERMAN DEFENCES WERE COMPLETELY INTACT AND NOW THEY KNEW THE ALLIES 
WERE COMING THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE HAD VANISHED 
WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE GONNA BOMBARD THE BEACH 
WE WERE GONNA BOMBARD THE ER THE CLIFFS 
WELL AS FAR AS WE WERE CONCERNED THEY DIDN'T 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY DROPPED THE BOMBS OR ANYTHING OR WHAT THEY DID 
BUT WHEN WE GOT THERE THEY WERE ALL THERE WAITING FOR US 
KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE LANDINGS ON OMAHA BEACH WAS A SPECIAL MISSION 
TO CAPTURE A GERMAN STRONGHOLD CALLED POINTE DU HOC 
PERCHED ON TOP OF ONE THIRTY F. T. HIGH CLIFFS JUST TO THE WEST OF THE BEACH 
IT WAS MADE THE NUMBER ONE TARGET AND WOULD BE ATTACKED IN THE FIRST ASSAULT WAVE 
THE ALLIED HIGH COMMAND BELIEVED THAT THE MISSION HERE 
AT THE POINTE DU HOC WAS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF D. DAY 
IF THE GUNS AT THE POINTE DU HOC WERE STILL FUNCTIONING WITH THEIR RANGE OF TWENTY THREE THOUSAND METRES FROM HERE 
THERE WAS A REAL DANGER THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHOOT AT DAMAGE 
SINK ALLIED SHIPPING OUT IN THE BAY OF THE SEINE 
SO FROM THE AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW FIRST ARMY SUCCESS 
AT OMAHA BEACH WAS INTEGRALLY TIED TO THE ASSAULT AT THE POINTE DU HOC 
IN THE END THE PLAN THEY COME UP WITH WAS NOT A COMPLICATED ONE 
THEY DECIDED THAT THE BEST WAY TO ATTACK POINTE DU HOC WAS TO LAND MEN ON THE BEACH 
DOWN THERE AND FOR THEM TO JUST CLIMB THE CLIFFS RIGHT UNDER THE NOSES OF THE GERMANS UP HERE 
IT BEGGARS BELIEF THEY'D HAVE HAD TO CLIMB UNDER FIRE AND THEN IF THEY DID MAKE IT TO THE TOP 
TAKE ON THE GERMANS WHO WERE JUST WAITING FOR THEM 
LIEUTENANT JAMES IKE EIKNER WAS AMONG THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HAND PICKED MEN 
FROM THE ELITE U. S. RANGERS CHOSEN FOR THE MISSION 
AT THE CLIFFS OF POINTE DU HOC WAS AS BIG AND DANGEROUS AS IT WAS 
AND IT ABSOLUTELY HAD TO BE NEUTRALISED OR THE WHOLE OPERATION WOULD BE IN DANGER IN JEOPARDY 
BUT THE GUNS THE RANGERS WERE ORDERED TO ATTACK 
BY THE GERMANS TO PROTECT THEM FROM BOMBING RAIDS 
ON D. DAY THERE'S EVEN SOME EVIDENCE THAT THEY'D BEEN TOLD BEFOREHAND THAT IN FACT THE GERMAN GUNS WEREN'T 
EVEN THERE TO THE POINT WHERE THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER WHO WAS SUPPOSED 
TO LEAD THE ASSAULT RATHER THAN THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE BATTALION 
ALLEGEDLY STARTED TO DRINK HEAVILY AND SAID THIS IS A SUICIDE MISSION WHY ARE WE DOING THIS 
LOOKING AT THE CLIFFS HERE IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE WHY HE HAD THAT VIEW 
IF THERE WERE NO GUNS THERE TO CAPTURE 
BUT THIS WAS STILL A TARGET THAT HAD TO BE TAKEN 
THE BATTERY POSITION THEY COULD NOT KNOW WITH ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE THAT THE GUNS WEREN'T THERE 
WHATEVER THE FRENCH RESISTANCE MIGHT TELL THEM THEY STILL HAD TO CUT THAT COASTAL ROAD 
AND IF THE GUNS WERE INLAND THEY HAD TO FIND THEM AND DESTROY THEM SO THIS IS A CRITICAL OBJECTIVE 
THE PLAN GAVE THEM HALF AN HOUR TO LAND CROSS THE BEACH 
CLIMB THE CLIFFS AND TAKE ON THE GERMANS 
AND THEN ONCE AT THE TOP THEY WERE TO SIGNAL THE REMAINING FIVE HUNDRED RANGERS 
WHO WERE WAITING FOR THEM A FEW MILES OUT THERE TO FOLLOW THEM IN 
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE PLAN WENT WRONG 
EARLY ON D. DAY MORNING THE RANGERS HEAD TOWARDS THE POINTE DU HOC THEY THINK 
BUT THE COXSWAINS MAKE AN ERROR IN NAVIGATION AND IT'S ONLY AS THEY APPROACH THE COASTLINE 
THAT THEY REALISE THEY'RE GOING TO THE WRONG PLACE 
SO THEY HAVE TO TURN BY NINETY DEGREES AND RUN ALONG THE COASTLINE 
TOWARDS THE POINTE DU HOC 
BUT THE ERROR MEANT THAT THEY WERE ALREADY WELL BEHIND SCHEDULE 
WE WERE FIRED ON WHILE COMING IN 
THIS WAS NOT A SURPRISE THE ENEMY HAD HAD ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES 
TO GET OUT OF HIS UNDERGROUND BUNKERS 
HE WAS UP THERE THROWING HAND GRENADES DOWN BY THE BASKETFUL AND FIRING RIGHT DOWN ON US 
AND THERE WAS RAPID FIRE SITUATIONS ON EITHER FLANK THAT WERE FIRING INTO US 
SO WE HAD THAT TO COME IN TO 
THEIR ROPES WERE FIRED UP THERE WERE GRAPPLE HOOKS SOME OF THEM PULLED OUT 
THE ENEMY DAMN IT CUT SOME OF THE ROPES THAT WAS NOT KOSHER 
AND THERE WERE TWO GUYS ON THE ROPE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME GOING UP 
SO I STARTED IN BEHIND THEM ABOUT FIFTY F. T. BELOW THEM 
AND THE ENEMY WAS LEANING OVER UP THERE THROWING DOWN GRENADES AND I YELLED UP TO THESE FELLOWS 
I SAID BOYS PUT YOUR FACES IN AND YOUR BUTTS OUT THEY'RE THROWING GRENADES 
AND ABOUT THAT TIME THERE WAS A HELLISH EXPLOSION VERY LOUD EXPLOSION 
AND I WAS KNOCKED OUT FOR A WHILE 
AGAINST ALL ODDS THE RANGERS' FIRST ASSAULT UNIT MADE IT TO THE TOP 
AND AFTER HEAVY FIGHTING THEY FOUND THE GERMAN GUNS A MILE INLAND AND DESTROYED THEM 
IT WAS AN AMAZING FEAT BUT BECAUSE THESE FIRST GUYS WERE DELAYED 
THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO THE REINFORCEMENTS TO COME IN BY THE ALLOTTED TIME 
WHICH MEANT OUT AT SEA THE REMAINING FIVE HUNDRED OR SO U. S. RANGERS NOW PUT PLAN B. INTO OPERATION 
THEY WERE TO LAND ON OMAHA BEACH THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT HEADLAND AND THEN MAKE THEIR WAY HERE BY LAND 
BUT OVER ON THE BEACH THE CAREFULLY LAID INVASION PLANS WERE BEING BLOWN APART 
THE MAIN FORCE HAD TO GO IN ON OMAHA BEACH 
AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT THEIR WAY UP TO US BY NOON 
AND THEY GOT UP THERE NOON ON THE THIRD DAY 
ON OMAHA BEACH THE GERMAN DEFENCES WERE COMPLETELY INTACT 
THE MEN LANDING ON THE BEACH WERE NOW PAYING THE FULL PRICE 
FOR THE FAILURE OF THE ALLIED AIR BOMBARDMENT 
IMAGINE THE SHOCK YOU'RE TOLD THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE 
THE GREATEST FIREPOWER SHOW ON EARTH 
AND THEN YOU HIT THE BEACH THERE AND EVERYBODY'S ALIVE 
ALL THE ENEMY FORCES ARE ALERT 
AND IT'S GONNA BE A BLOODY DAY IT'S GONNA BE A BLOODY DAY IT WAS A BLOODY DAY 
THE FIRST TROOPS HIT OMAHA BEACH SHORTLY AFTER LOW TIDE 
IN FRONT OF THEM WAS THREE HUNDRED YARDS OF OPEN SAND 
AS THEY LAND THEY'RE IN A NATURAL KILLING GROUND THEY'RE ON BEACHES 
THAT ARE COMPLETELY EXPOSED TO ENEMY FIRE THERE IS NO COVER 
THERE'S NO TREES NO TRENCHES THE TROOPS ARE OUT THERE IN THE OPEN 
THEY LOWERED THE RAMP AND WE STARTED FILING OFF THAT THING RUNNING OFF IT 
AND THE MACHINE GUN FIRE WAS GOING C. H. C. H. C. H. C. H. C. H. ACROSS THE WATER 
EIGHTY EIGHTS WERE LANDING THERE SCREAMING MIMIS WERE COMING IN 
IT WAS JUST PURE HELL 
WE WERE GETTING DIRECT FIRE 
BOTH FROM MACHINE GUN AND ARTILLERY AND THAT 
AND ER THEY DROPPED THE RAMP AND ER FELLOWS GOING OFF THE RAMP 
THAT WAS IT THEY WERE GETTING HIT RIGHT THERE 
THE MACHINE GUN FIRE WAS COMING IN THERE 
AND OUR FIRST SERGEANT HE JUST FLOPPED DOWN THERE 
THE FIRST TWO GUYS THEY WERE JUST GETTING 
SO IT WAS MAY AS WELL TRY ANOTHER WAY 
FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED I WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND I BAILED OUT 
OVER THE SIDE AND THE FELLOWS AROUND ME WERE BAILING OFF THE SIDE OF THE SHIP 
WE WEREN'T GONNA THERE'S NO REASON TO BE RUNNING OFF THE FRONT OF THAT THING THERE 
YOU COULDN'T SEE FROM WHERE THE FIRE WAS COMING 
YOU COULDN'T SEE ANY GUN FLASHES NO SMOKE 
ALL YOU KNOW IS SOMETHING'S COMING AT YOU AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM 
WHAT AMAZED ME WAS THERE WERE NO BOMB CRATERS 
WHERE WERE THE BOMB CRATERS WE COULDN'T HIDE ANYWHERE 
WELL THERE WERE JUST A MASS OF FELLOWS LAYING ALL OVER THE PLACE 
OVER THERE IT WAS JUST IT WAS ABSOLUTE SLAUGHTER 
SO DESPITE ALL THE DETAILED PLANNING 
ALL THE PAINSTAKING PREPARATION 
WITHIN MINUTES IT HAD ALL JUST GONE WRONG 
ABSOLUTELY AND THIS IS THE EVIDENCE OF HOW BADLY WRONG THINGS HAD GONE 
THIS IS AN AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN BY AN AMERICAN AIRCRAFT THAT FLEW THE ENTIRE 
LENGTH OF OMAHA BEACH FROM WEST TO EAST ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS TAKEN 
THE REALLY SOBERING SIGHT IS ALL THESE LITTLE BLACK DOTS 
ALL THESE LITTLE BLACK MARKS THESE ARE ALL INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEINGS 
WHAT WE SEE HERE ARE THE DEAD AND THE WOUNDED 
FOR EXAMPLE HERE THERE'S A SMALL CLUTCH OF MEN WHO'VE PROBABLY BEEN PULLED UP TO THE TOP OF THE BEACH 
DRAGGED UP TO THE COMPARATIVE SAFELY OFFERED BY THE SEA WALL 
THEY'RE LYING PERPENDICULAR THESE GUYS ARE WOUNDED 
THEY'VE BEEN DRAGGED UP THE BEACH AND HAVE SOME COVER FROM ENEMY FIRE 
BUT THERE ARE MUCH LARGER NUMBERS STREWN ALONG THE HIGH WATER MARK LYING PARALLEL WITH THE WATER LINE 
THEY'VE BEEN WASHED UP AS THE TIDE HAS RISEN 
EVERY ONE OF THESE BLACK DOTS IS A DEAD AMERICAN SOLDIER 
IN THIS SINGLE PHOTOGRAPH OF A ONE SMALL SECTOR OF OMAHA BEACH 
THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED YOUNG AMERICANS LYING DEAD ALONG THE WATER 
AND THIS PHOTOGRAPH IN ORDER TO GET A MOSAIC OF ALL OF OMAHA BEACH 
YOU'D NEED MANY OF THESE ALONGSIDE ONE ANOTHER MANY OF THEM LOOKING JUST LIKE THIS 
WE GET SOME SORT OF SENSE OF THE SACRIFICE MADE BY AMERICAN YOUNG MEN 
IN ORDER TO UNLOCK THE DEFENCES OF OMAHA BEACH 
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS ALL ALONG OMAHA BEACH 
ONCE I REACHED THE BEACH THERE'S TWO FELLOWS FROM MY COMPANY THERE 
JIM SLAGLE AND JOE DANIELS 
JOE DANIELS WAS FULL OF HOLES AND THAT THERE 
AND HE WAS MUMBLING AROUND THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT 
BUT HE DIDN'T LAST NO TIME WHEN I WAS THERE AND HE WENT ON 
I HAD NEVER HEARD A GERMAN MACHINE GUN PRIOR TO THAT 
AMERICAN MACHINE GUN IS DAT DAT DAT DAT DAT DAT DAT DAT 
AND A GERMAN MACHINE GUN IS BRR BRR BRR BRRT IT'S JUST SPITTING OUT SHELLS SO FAST 
I GOT HIT TWICE WITH MACHINE GUNS IN THE ARM AND 
AND IT JUST ABOUT TORE MY ARM OFF 
WHEN IT JUST FLEW ME BACKWARDS AND INTO THE WATER AND ER 
IT WAS ER 
THERE WASN'T PAIN IT WAS JUST A THUD 
YOU DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WAS WHAT TILL YOU LOOKED DOWN THERE 
AND MY ARM WAS JUST DANGLING 
AND THE BLOOD WAS JUST FLOWING OUT OF THERE 
LIKE IT LOOKED LIKE I WOULDN'T LAST A MINUTE AND I'D HAVE NO MORE BLOOD 
THE ASSAULT ON OMAHA BEACH WAS A COSTLY ONE 
OFFICIAL RECORDS PUT THE LOSSES AT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND MEN DEAD WOUNDED OR MISSING 
BUT SUCH WAS THE DEVASTATION AND CARNAGE HERE ON D. DAY 
FOR YEARS NOBODY COULD COME TO AN EXACT FIGURE 
ONLY NOW CAN IT BE REVEALED JUST HOW BLOODY OMAHA REALLY WAS 
JOE BALKOSKI IS THE HISTORIAN FOR THE U. S. ARMY'S TWENTY NINTH INFANTRY DIVISION 
AND HAS SPENT YEARS RESEARCHING THE EVENTS OF OMAHA BEACH 
IT WAS NOT IN ANY WAY FORESEEN 
THAT THE CASUALTIES WOULD COME WITH THE INTENSITY THAT THEY DID 
IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF HOURS OF THE INVASION 
FROM SIX HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE MORNING TO NINE HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE MORNING ON D. DAY 
AMERICAN SOLDIERS WERE BEING FELLED ON THE BEACH 
LIKE STALKS OF WHEAT BY A SICKLE 
JOE HAS STUDIED HUNDREDS OF D. DAY OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS 
HE BELIEVES THE TRUE CASUALTY FIGURE ON OMAHA BEACH IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NUMBER INITIALLY RECORDED 
THE CASUALTY COUNT ON OMAHA BEACH IN RETROSPECT WAS MUCH MUCH HIGHER 
THAN HISTORIANS HAD PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT 
REALISTICALLY ONLY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
HAVE HISTORIANS BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE COUNT WAS PROBABLY TWICE AS HIGH AS FIRST THOUGHT 
IN THE RANGE OF FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND MEN 
BECAME CASUALTIES ON OMAHA IN AN EIGHTEEN HOUR PERIOD 
EVER SINCE JUNE SIXTH NINETEEN FORTY FOUR QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED 
AS TO WHY THERE WERE SO MANY MORE CASUALTIES ON OMAHA BEACH 
SIMON TREW BELIEVES THAT SENIOR AMERICAN COMMANDERS 
NOT ONLY ACCEPTED THE POSSIBILITY OF HIGH CASUALTIES 
BUT HAD PLANNED FOR THEM 
SO GIVEN ITS SITUATION 
GIVEN WHAT THEY HAD HERE WAS THIS ALWAYS GONNA BE A BLOOD BATH WAS IT JUST INEVITABLE 
THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE ANALYSTS APPRECIATED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING MANY MONTHS BEFORE D. DAY 
THAT THEY WERE GONNA FACE REAL PROBLEMS AT OMAHA BEACH 
THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD TO GET ASHORE QUICKLY 
STORM THE BLUFFS NEUTRALISE THE ENEMY STRONG POINTS 
BEFORE THEY COULD RECOVER AND START FIRING DOWN ONTO OMAHA BEACH 
THE AMERICANS WEREN'T STUPID THEY REALISED THAT THEY MIGHT FACE 
REALLY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS AND THEY MIGHT SUSTAIN POTENTIALLY THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES 
THE AMERICAN FIRST ARMY ACTUALLY CALCULATED THAT THEY MIGHT LOSE AS MANY AS SIX THOUSAND MEN AT OMAHA BEACH 
ACTUALLY A FIGURE NOT VERY FAR FROM THE TRUTH 
BUT ALTHOUGH THE AMERICANS HAD PLANNED FOR THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES 
THEY'D NOT BEEN EXPECTING TO LOSE SO MANY IN THE FIRST TWO HOURS 
WITH THE GERMAN DEFENCES INTACT THE ASSAULT WAS RAPIDLY UNRAVELLING 
IMAGINE ALL THESE GUYS THEIR BUDDIES WERE KILLED 
BLOOD AND GUTS EVERYWHERE PARALYSIS SHOCK 
WHAT THE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING DOES 
WHEN THEY SEE BLOOD GUTS SPREAD ALL OVER THE PLACE IS THEY STOP 
THEY LOOK AND THEY STARE IT'S A HUMAN REACTION IT'S A GUT REACTION 
AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT THAT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE TARGETED AND KILLED 
RIGHT YOU NEED TO BE MOVING FORWARD EVERY TIME YOU STOP ON A BATTLEFIELD 
YOUR CHANCES OF SURVIVING DIMINISH GREATLY 
YEAH THERE WERE A LOT OF DEAD BODIES A LOT OF EQUIPMENT 
LOT OF DESTROYED VEHICLES 
THE BEACH WAS BLOCKED 
YOU COULDN'T MOVE THERE WAS NO RADIO COMMUNICATION 
NONE AT ALL 
ABSOLUTELY NONE 
AND SO YOU WERE IN THE WRONG PLACE YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHY YOU WERE THERE 
YOU KNOW HOW YOU GOT THERE 
AND YOU COULDN'T GO WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GO 
THOSE ASSAULT TROOPS WHO WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET ACROSS THE BEACH 
FACED AN EVEN GREATER PERIL AND THAT WAS WHAT DO YOU DO NOW 
AND FOR NOW THE ONLY THING THEY COULD DO WAS LIE ON THEIR STOMACHS 
BECAUSE IF THEY RAISED THEIR HEAD OR STOOD UP THEY HAD A GOOD CHANCE OF HAVING IT BLOWN OFF 
YOU COULDN'T GO BACK AND YOU COULDN'T GO FORWARD 
WHEN I WAS HURT SHOT AND THAT AND I'M LAYING ON THE BEACH 
I FELT BAD THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO BE PART OF THE GROUP ONE WAS WITH 
IN FACT IT ER 
MY CONSCIENCE BOTHERED ME THAT I DIDN'T HERE I AM JUST LAYING HERE 
THAT BOTHERED ME 
I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING 
BUT THE MIRACLE OF THE ASSAULT OF OMAHA BEACH NOW BEGAN 
THE DISPLACED GROUP OF ELITE U. S. RANGERS FROM POINTE DU HOC ARRIVED ON THE BEACH IN THE WRONG PLACE 
BUT AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THE IMPETUS THEY BROUGHT 
WOULD HELP TO TURN A POTENTIAL DISASTER INTO VICTORY 
JOINING UP WITH THE REMNANTS OF OTHER UNITS THESE FIVE HUNDRED EXTRA MEN WOULD FIGHT THEIR WAY OFF THE BEACH 
AND UP THE BLUFFS TO ATTACK THE GERMAN POSITIONS FROM THE REAR 
WELL I FOUND OUT LATER THAT A GENERAL FROM THE TWENTY NINTH ONE HUNDRED SIXTEENTH INFANTRY 
CAME UP TO COLONEL SNIDER OF THE FIFTH RANGERS AND HE SAID WE'RE JAMMED UP ON THIS BEACH 
GET THESE RANGERS OFF THE BEACH AND LEAD THE WAY UP THAT HILL 
THE ARRIVAL OF THESE GUYS IS GONNA HAVE AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT EFFECT 
GOING UP THOSE BLUFFS INLAND TO THE VILLAGE OF VIERVILLE 
SECURING A DEFENSIVE POSITION AGAINST GERMAN COUNTER ATTACKS 
AND OUT FLANKING THE GERMAN POSITIONS ALONG THE BLUFFS HERE 
IT'S GONNA BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE AMERICAN SUCCESS 
THEY SAID WHEN THAT WIRE BLOWS EVERYBODY GOES THROUGH THAT WIRE 
AND WE GO STRAIGHT UP THAT HILL AND EVERYBODY STAYS IN LINE 
HAD THOSE RANGERS GONE WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT 
IF WE'D HAD THE FIVE HUNDRED RANGERS WHO LANDED HERE GOING TO THE POINTE DU HOC AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE 
THEN THE SOLDIERS HERE THE FEW SURVIVORS OF THE INITIAL ASSAULTS 
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN PINNED DOWN FOR MANY MORE HOURS WHO KNOWS 
THE GERMANS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LAUNCH COUNTER ATTACKS FROM THIS END 
TO ROLL UP THE AMERICANS FROM THE FLANK 
AND THIS WESTERN PART OF OMAHA BEACH IS A REAL DISASTER 
WHAT HAD BEEN SO NEARLY A DISASTER WAS TURNED INTO A VICTORY 
THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS FOUGHT THEIR WAY OFF OMAHA BEACH TO JOIN UP WITH THE BRITISH AND CANADIANS 
THE NORMANDY LANDINGS HAD SUCCEEDED 
OF COURSE THE WAR IN EUROPE DIDN'T END ON D. DAY 
AND ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ALLIED SERVICEMEN WOULD DIE 
BEFORE VICTORY WAS SECURED A YEAR LATER 
BUT IT MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE END 
THIS IS A MONUMENT TO THE U. S. RANGERS AND WHAT THEY DID WAS INCREDIBLE 
BUT THEY WERE JUST ONE SMALL UNIT WITHIN A HUGE AMERICAN CANADIAN AND BRITISH FORCE 
MEN DIED ON ALL THE ASSAULT BEACHES AND THEY ALL NEED TO BE REMEMBERED 
BUT PERHAPS BECAUSE IT WAS THE TOUGHEST AND THE BLOODIEST 
OMAHA BEACH HAS BECOME A SYMBOL TO REPRESENT ALL OF THE NORMANDY INVASION 
SO THE ALLIED COMMANDERS KNEW THAT OMAHA BEACH WAS GONNA BE BAD 
IN FACT THEY PLANNED FOR A WORST CASE SCENARIO OF SIX THOUSAND CASUALTIES 
THAT TO ME MAKES IT AN EVEN MORE HEROIC STORY 
BECAUSE THE MEN THEMSELVES KNEW IT WAS A NUMBERS GAME 
THEY KNEW THAT SOME OF THEM WOULDN'T BE COMING BACK 
NO MORE ROOM FOR ANGELS 
TO DANCE OR EVEN STAND 
UPON THIS PIN ENTANGLED 
BLEEDING SUGAR FROM OUR HANDS 
BLEEDING ASHES FROM OUR FEET 
WON'T YOU HELP ME COUNT MY SHEEP 
WON'T YOU HELP ME COUNT MY SHEEP TONIGHT 
YOU CAN RATTLE OFF THE NAMES
