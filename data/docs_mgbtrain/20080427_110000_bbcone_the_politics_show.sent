LEARN FROM COLORADO AND IN LONDON THIS WEEK BY HIS OWN 
ADMISSION KEN LIVINGSTONE IS IN THE 
FIGHT OF HIS POLITICAL LIFE TIM 
TIM DONOVAN WILL BE SPEAKING TO HIM 
I WILL BE TALKING TO IT CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF THE OIL COMPANY AT THE 
HEART OF THE GRANGEMOUTH STRIKE OR 
AFTER THE NEWS WITH MAXINE 
MAWHINNEY MAWHINNEY THAT IS OUR MAIN STORY TWELVE HUNDRED 
WORKERS AT THE GRANGEMOUTH OIL 
REFINERY HAVE BEGUN THEIR TWO DAY 
STRIKE IN A DISPUTE OVER PENSION 
RIGHTS PRODUCTION HAS CEASED AT 
THE PLANT AND B. P. HAS SHED A KEY 
PIPELINE FROM OIL FEEDS IN THE 
NORTH SEA OIL FIELDS THE 
GOVERNMENT INSISTS THERE WILL BE NO 
SHORTAGES SHORTAGES THE NIGHT SHIFT WORKERS WALKED OUT 
AT SIX A M. THIS MARKS THE FIRST 
SHUTDOWN OF THE GRANGEMOUTH 
REFINERY IN MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS AS 
THEY LEFT THEIR POSTS THEY SAID 
THEY WERE DETERMINED TO PROTECT 
THEIR PENSION RIGHTS 
I REALLY 
BELIEVE IN IT WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT 
FOR OUR PENSIONS AND DEFEND THEM TO 
THE END 
I JUST THINK THE COMPANY 
HAS BEEN WE COULD UNDERSTAND IF 
THINGS WERE BAD BUT THEY ARE FAR 
FROM BAD NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE 
BUT THEY HAVE NOT 
GIVEN US ANY CHOICE 
A AS STAFF 
PICKET THE PLANT THE OWNERS SAY 
THEY NEED TO ALTER PENSION 
PROVISION FOR NEW WORKERS AS PART 
OF THEIR PLANS TO MODERNISE AND 
SAFEGUARD THE COMPANY'S FUTURE THE THE PLANT NEEDS A HUGE INJECTION OF 
INVESTMENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
OR SO WE ARE LOOKING AT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY 
MILLION WORTH OF INVESTMENT THE 
UNION ARE PUTTING THAT INVESTMENT 
AT RISK THROUGH THEIR ACTION ON 
THE BACK OF THAT INVESTMENT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY 
JOBS AS WELL 
THERE IS AN AGREEMENT 
TO BRING IN LIMITED STOCKS OF 
FOREIGN OIL BY SHIP BUT THAT WILL 
NOT EASE THE SITUATION AT THE 
FORECOURT WHERE SPORADIC BOUTS OF 
PANIC BUYING CONTINUED TO LEAD TO 
RUNS ON SUPPLIES IN SOME PARTS OF 
SCOTLAND SCOTLAND WITH THAT THE SUPPLY OF ALMOST HALF 
OF OUR OIL AFFECTED BY THIS DISPUTE 
BOTH THE UNIONS AND THE COMPANY 
WILL COME UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE 
TO GET BACK AROUND THE NEGOTIATING 
TABLE TABLE TALEBAN FIGHTERS HAVE ATTACKED A 
MILITARY PARADE ATTENDED BY 
AFGHANISTAN'S PRESIDENT HAMID 
KARZAI AND OTHER DIGNITARIES AT 
LEAST ONE PERSON WAS KILLED AND ELEVEN 
INJURED IN THE ASSAULT AMONG THEM 
TWO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT ALASTAIR 
LEITHEAD REPORTS FROM KABUL 
A MILITARY CELEBRATION OF A FAMOUS 
AFGHAN MUJAHEDIN VICTORY WAS BEING 
SHOWN LIVE ON T. V. BUT AS THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM WAS PLAYING SHOTS 
RANG OUT 
TWO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WERE 
STRUCK BY THE FIRST BULLETS THEY 
WERE JUST FIFTY METRES FROM PRESIDENT 
KARZAI ALONGSIDE HIM WERE KEY 
GOVERNMENT AND INTERNATIONAL 
LEADERS INCLUDING THE BRITISH AND 
AMERICAN AMBASSADORS AND THE NATO 
COMMANDER AS THE PRESIDENT AND 
V. I. P.'S WERE A REST FROM THE SCENE BY 
BODYGUARDS THE AFGHAN SECURITY 
FORCES RETURNED FIRE THOSE TAKING 
PART IN A MILITARY POSSESSION RAN 
FOR COVER EXPLOSIONS FOLLOWED AND 
WHAT ARE THOUGHT TO BE MORTARS 
LANDED CLOSE TO THE PARADE GROUND 
THE TALEBAN CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY 
MINUTES SAYING THREE OF THEIR MEN 
HAD BEEN KILLED AND OTHERS ARRESTED 
THE ATTACK SAID THEY SAID THE 
ATTACK WAS PREFIGURED STRIKE 
WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THEY WANTED 
THIS WILL BE WORRYING FOR THE 
AFGHANS AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY THE TALEBAN PENETRATED 
HIGH SECURITY AND GOT WITHIN 
STRIKING DISTANCE OF PRESIDENT 
KARZAI AND KEY AFGHAN AND 
INTERNATIONAL LEADERS IN THE HEART 
OF THE CAPITAL CITY 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH IS BEING PARADED 
THROUGH THE SOUTH KOREAN CAPITAL OF 
SEOUL THERE HAVE BEEN SCUFFLES 
BETWEEN SECURITY STAFF AND PRO 
TIBETAN PROTESTERS THE AUTHORITIES 
SAY THOSE DISRUPTING THE RELAY WILL 
BE DEALT WITH SEVERELY 
THERE IS NEWS THREAT THE AFTERNOON 
ON THE B. B. C. NEWS CHANNEL AND A FULL 
ROUND UP ON B. B. C. ONE AT SIX OH FIVE P. M. 
AS WE HEARD IN THE NEWS TODAY IS 
THE FIRST DAY OF A FORTY EIGHT HOUR STRIKE 
AT THE GRANGEMOUTH OIL REFINERY IT 
IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE MORE ON 
THE WAY L. AM JOINED FROM 
MANCHESTER BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OF INEOS WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
GRANGEMOUTH TOM CROTTY WHAT IS 
YOUR REACTION TO THIS FIRST EVER 
STRIKE TAKING PLACE AT GRANGEMOUTH 
DISAPPOINTMENT IT IS AMAZING WE'RE 
IN THIS POSITION WE HAVE BEEN 
WORKING ON A NINE MONTH PROCESS OF 
CHANGING THE PENSION SCHEME 
EVERYBODY KNOWS PENSIONS NEED TO 
CHANGE AND HAS SEEN THAT THEY ARE 
CHANGING AROUND THE COUNTRY WE 
HAVE A NINE MONTH PROCESS SIX 
MONTHS INTO THAT THE UNION HAS 
STOOD UP THROWN A STRIKE ON THE 
TABLE AND WALKED AWAY FROM THE 
TALKS WE HAVE MADE CONCESSION 
AFTER CONCESSION FROM OUR RICH 
OPPOSITION TO TRY TO KEEP THEM 
NEGOTIATING HOUR ORIGINAL 
POSITION 
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO POSITION MEET UNION DEMANDS LONG TERM LONG TERM COMPETITIVENESS IS THE ISSUE WE 
KNOW WHAT PENSIONS ARE LIKE IN THE 
NATIONAL SENSE ALL AROUND THE 
COUNTRY PENSIONS ARE CHANGING 
THIS IS A HUGELY GENEROUS FINAL 
SALARY SCHEME ZERO CONTRIBUTIONS 
WERE A FANTASTIC PENSION THAT IS 
NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS DAY AND AGE 
WE HAVE TO INVEST SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ON 
THE SITE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS HOW 
CAN WE DO THAT WHEN WE HAVE SUCH AN 
UNCOMPETITIVE POSITION 
HOW MUCH 
WILL IT TAKE TO GET GRANGEMOUTH UP 
AND RUNNING AGAIN AND FUEL SUPPLIES 
SECURE 
WE HOPE IT WILL GO AS SECURE BERKELEY WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE 
ENTIRE SITE SHOWN DOWN WE HOPE 
IT WILL GO SMOOTHLY THEY HAVE 
AGREED TO KEEP THE SIDE ONE WHICH 
WILL MAKE THE RESTART QUICKER WE 
HOPE WITHIN A MATTER OF A WEEK WE 
SHOULD BE WITHIN PRODUCTION WE 
WILL WE REALLY WILL NOT KNOW 
UNTIL TUESDAY MORNING 
THEN THERE 
IS THE PROSPECT OF FURTHER STRIKES 
IF THERE IS THAT WOULD BE 
DISASTROUS SITUATION NOT JUST FOR 
THE COMPANY BUT FOR THE COUNTRY WE 
HAVE SEEN THAT THIS ISSUE HOW IT 
HAS ACCELERATED AND IMPACTED ON THE 
NORTH SEA THIS WAS NOT BE P.'S 
FIGHT THE NORTH SEA'S FIGHT B. P. 
THIS WAS BETWEEN INEOS AND 
GRANGEMOUTH WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST 
THREE DAYS DOING NOTHING ELSE WITH 
THE UNION OTHER THAN TALKING TO 
THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY TO TRY TO 
STOP THEM SHEDDING THE NORTH SEA 
DOWN EVEN TO THE EXTENT JUST TO 
GIVE YOU FEEL WE SAID THAT IF 
YOUR PROBLEM IS WE ARE MAKING 
PROFIT ANY PROFIT WE WILL MAKE 
DONATE TO CHARITY WE COULD NOT 
THINK OF ANY OTHER THING TO DO TO 
MINI MISE DISRUPTION THE UNION WILL 
MINIMISE DISRUPTION TAKE A DIFFERENT STANCE BUT THE 
INDUSTRY BODY SAID IT WOULD LIKE 
THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE WILL 
THAT HELP 
CLEARLY WE HAVE HAD 
LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS WITH GOVERNMENT 
NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE BORDER THEY 
HAVE ENCOURAGED US TO FIND A 
RESOLUTION OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN 
TO TRY TO FIND THAT THROUGH MAKING 
CONCESSION AFTER CONCESSION 
FUNDAMENTALLY IT GOT TO THE POINT 
WHERE WHAT THIS STRIKE IS NOW ABOUT 
ARE THE PENSIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T EVEN WORK AT GRANGEMOUTH 
BECAUSE WE AGREED TO TAKE OFF THE 
TABLE AND PUT INTO A SEPARATE 
PROCESS ANYTHING THAT IMPACT ON ANY 
WORK AT GRANGEMOUTH TODAY THE 
UNION IS STRIKING FOR PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T EVEN WORK FOR OUR COMPANY L. 
HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO GORDON BROWN DO DO YOU EXPECT TO 
I WOULD NOT PRESUME 
TO THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO MAKE 
ITS OWN MIND UP OF WHAT IT NEEDS TO 
DO WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN 
AS A COMPANY TO TRY TO DO TRY TO 
RESOLVE THIS WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
DO THAT MAKE NO MISTAKE ON 
TUESDAY THE SITE WILL BE 
RESTARTING WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
TALK TO THE UNION THROUGHOUT THE 
COMING WEEKS 
PLUS SIDE YOU THINK 
THE PUBLIC WILL BE ON THE WORKERS 
TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR PENSIONS 
OR THE OWNER OF YOUR COMPANY WHO 
ACCORDING TO THE SUNDAY TIMES RICH 
LIST IS WORTH TWO POINT THREE BILLION LET'S LET'S BE QUITE CLEAR WE EMPLOY SIXTEEN THOUSAND 
PEOPLE ON SEVENTY EIGHT SITES AROUND THE WORLD 
WE HAVE ONE SITE WITH THIS ISSUE 
OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR WORKERS 
ON EVERY OTHER SITE IN THE WORLD 
ARE EXTREMELY GOOD WE HAVE MADE 
CHANGES TO PENSION SCHEMES ON ALL 
OF THOSE OTHER SITES WITHOUT THIS 
SORT OF AMAZING SITUATION 
DEVELOPING I WOULD HOPE PEOPLE 
WOULD SEE IT FOR WHAT IT IS WE 
HAVE MADE CONCESSION AFTER 
CONCESSION AFTER CONCESSION AND YOU 
GET TO THE POINT WHERE ENOUGH IS 
ENOUGH ENOUGH THERE IS MORE ON THAT STORY FOR 
VIEWERS IN SCOTLAND LATER IN THE 
PROGRAMME WHEREVER YOU ARE IN THE 
COUNTRY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS 
THAT PART OF THE PROGRAMME VIA OUR 
WEBSITE 
TEN P. OR NOT TEN P. THAT WAS THE 
QUESTION THAT CONVULSED WESTMINSTER 
THIS WEEK AS GORDON BROWN BACKS 
DOWN IN THE FACE OF A THREATENED 
REBELLION BY HIS OWN M. P.'S THEY WERE 
UNHAPPY ABOUT THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN P. TAX BAND AND THREATENING TO 
VOTE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT THE 
VOTE WAS CALLED OFF SO THE 
IMMEDIATE POLITICAL CRISIS HAS 
PASSED BUT WHAT IMPACT WILL THE 
EPISODE HAVE ON THIS WEEK'S LOCAL 
ELECTIONS IN MINUTE I WILL ASK 
OUR FORMER CHIEF POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT JOHN SERGEANT BUT 
FIRST WE PRESENT THE THE POLITICS 
SHOW BLUFFER'S GUIDE TO THIS WEEK'S 
ELECTIONS ELECTIONS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON THURSDAY 
WILL GO TO THE POLLS TO DISCOVER 
WHO GOVERNS THEM AT LOCAL LEVEL 
THAT IS AROUND THIRD OF THE 
COUNCILS IN ENGLAND WHO WILL BE 
HOLDING ELECTIONS ADD TO THAT THE 
RACE TO BE MAYOR OF LONDON AND YOU 
CAN SEE THAT 
THE FIRST IS GOING 
TO BE VERY BIG DAY INDEED IN 
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN LABOUR CONTROL TWO HUNDRED SIX LOCAL 
COUNCILS AND TO CONSERVATIVES HAD 
TWENTY THREE LABOUR CONTROLLED 
NOW THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE MORE 
THAN TWO HUNDRED LOCAL COUNCILS AND LABOUR 
HAVE JUST FIFTY SEVEN WITH THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS ON TWENTY NINE NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY HAVE NO 
OVERALL CONTROL POLITICAL EDITORS 
AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN 
FINDING OUT WHAT WE CAN EXPECT 
LABOUR'S GENERAL ELECTION VICTORIES 
WERE BUILT ON WINNING PARLIAMENTARY 
SEATS IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND ONE 
DECADE LATER LABOUR HAS ALREADY 
LOST ALMOST EVERYTHING IT HAD TO 
LOSE DRAW A LINE FROM BRISTOL TO 
THE WASH AND OUTSIDE LONDON THE 
PARTY CONTROLS JUST THREE COUNCILS 
ITS LAST STRONGHOLDS ARE READING 
LUTON AND STEVENAGE ITS HOLD ON 
READING COULD BE UNDER THREAT ON 
MAY FIRST 
IT IS A SIMILAR STORY HERE IN THE 
WEST MIDLANDS TEN YEARS AGO LABOUR 
HELD GREAT SWATHES OF THE MAJOR 
CONURBATIONS THEY CONTROLLED 
BIRMINGHAM OF COURSE THAT IS LONG 
GONE NOW THE CONSERVATIVES STILL 
HAVE PROBLEM NEXT WEEK THEY 
WILL BE DEFENDING TINY MAJORITIES 
IN THE FORMER LABOUR FIEFDOMS OF 
COVENTRY AND DEADLY GORDON BROWN'S 
PARTY DOES NOT HAVE THAT MUCH TO 
LOSE THEY HAVE LOST TOO MANY 
COUNCILS THEY CAN'T REALLY GO MUCH 
FURTHER BUT IT WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH 
TO KNOCK THE CONSERVATIVES OFF 
THEIR PERCHES IN PLACES LIKE 
COVENTRY AND GOODLY EVEN IF LABOUR 
ARE HAVING ANOTHER BAD NIGHT 
COVENTRY AND DUDLEY 
WHAT ABOUT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
LIVERPOOL IS THE EUROPEAN CAPITAL 
OF CULTURE THIS YEAR YOU HAVE FELT 
SUCH PRESTIGIOUS EVENT WOULD 
CEMENT CONTROL OF A CITY THAT THE 
LIB DEMS HAVE HELD FOR THE LAST TEN 
YEARS WELL THINK AGAIN THEY HAVE 
BEEN RIVEN BY INTERNAL SPLITS AND 
RECENTLY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
DECLARED LIVERPOOL CITY COUNCIL THE 
WORST AUTHORITY IN THE COUNTRY 
LABOUR IS UNLIKELY TO WIN HERE BUT 
THE PARTY WILL HAVE SMILE ON ITS 
FACE IF THE LIB DEMS LOSE CONTROL 
ONE PLACE LABOUR ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
IS THE RAILS THE LAST TIME ROUND 
THEY LOST CONTROL THE FOUR OF THE 
COUNTRY'S BIGGEST COUNCILS TO THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IS WALES 
NEWPORT IS THE ONLY CITY STRONGHOLD 
AND THEY ARE DETERMINED TO HOLD ON 
TO IT THE LIB DEMS WANT TO HOLD ON 
TO WHAT THEY'VE GOT THE 
CONSERVATIVES WANT TO SHOW THEIR 
REVIVAL IN LAST YEAR'S ASSEMBLY 
ELECTIONS HAVE LEGS AND PLAID 
CYMRU ARE NOW A PARTY OF GOVERNMENT 
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT WILL 
DO THEM ANY GOOD AT ALL ON THE 
DOORSTEPS DOORSTEPS AND LABOUR'S BIGGEST NIGHTMARE 
COULD OF COURSE HAVE BEEN HERE IN 
LONDON BORIS JOHNSON IS GIVING KEN 
LIVINGSTONE THE FRIGHT OF HIS 
POLITICAL LIFE IF BORIS JOHNSON 
DOES WIN AND IF YOU BELIEVE THE 
POLLS THIS ONE HAS CLAIMED RIGHT 
DOWN TO THE WIRE THEN STAND BY FOR 
SOME TRULY DREADFUL HEADLINES FOR 
LABOUR THIS ONE IS GOING THE MAN 
ONCE DUBBED THE BLUNTEST SUICIDE 
NOTE IN HISTORY COULD BE ABOUT TO 
DELIVER KILLER BLOW IT WOULD 
TAKE BRAVE MAN OR WOMAN TO CALL 
THIS ONE WITH ANY CERTAINTY 
THIS TIME NEXT WEEK NO DOUBT WE 
WILL BE TREATED TO LOTS OF TALK 
ABOUT MIXED RESULTS AND STEADY 
PROGRESS WHAT ARE THOSE PHRASES 
MEAN JOINING US MY FORMER 
COLLEAGUE JOHN SERGEANT CHIEF 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AT THE B. B. C. 
AND POLITICAL EDITOR AT I. T. N. WHAT 
OF THOSE PHRASES WE SHOULD BE 
LOOKING FOR 
NOT AS BAD AS EXPECTED 
IS THE ONE THAT IS BEING PREPARED 
BY LABOUR THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT 
IS A VERY COMPLICATED RESULT NOT 
JUST BECAUSE OF LOCAL ISSUES BUT 
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME THESE SEATS 
WERE FOUGHT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO 
WHEN LABOUR WERE IN THE DOLDRUMS 
OVER THE IRAQ CONTROVERSY WHATEVER 
HAPPENS LABOUR CAN'T DO THAT BADLY 
ON THURSDAY YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE 
IT FROM THE COVERAGE WHICH YOU 
THE OTHER THING WHICH WILL HAPPEN 
IS THAT THERE IS A GREAT INTEREST 
IN LONDON BUT IF KEN LIVINGSTONE 
WINS PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL IT IS 
KEN LIVINGSTONE IT IS NOT LABOUR 
SIMILARLY WITH BORIS JOHNSON 
PEOPLE THINK OF IT OFF THINK OF 
IT AS KEN AND BORIS THAT IS AN 
ADVANTAGE IF THE PARTY DOES NOT DO 
WELL THEY CAN SAY IT IS 
PERSONALITY THERE IS NO WAY AROUND 
WHAT ABOUT EXPECTATION IT MANAGEMENT HOWDY SHAPE THE FIELD 
OF BATTLE BEFOREHAND SO YOU HAVE TO 
FIND WHAT IT IS FROM LONG 
EXPERIENCE OF DOING THESE THINGS 
HOW DO YOU 
KEN BAKER YEARS AGO AS 
A CONSERVATIVE CHAIRMAN HE 
DESIGNATED RICHMOND SAYING THAT 
WAS THE KEY OF COURSE RICHMOND 
DID NOT FALL WHEN RESULTS CAME HE 
SAID I TOLD YOU 
IT COULD BE A 
SLAUGHTER ELSEWHERE BUT BECAUSE 
YOU HAVE TO FIND THE NARROW BEACH 
BOY YOU THINK YOU WILL DO WELL 
TO FIND THE NARROWED IT GIVEN GIVEN THAT LABOUR MIGHT LOSE READING 
THEY WILL NOT LOSE IN THAT SENSE 
THEY CAN ALL SAY WE DID NOT LOSE 
MANY COUNCILS EVEN THOUGH IT COULD 
BE A TERRIBLE NIGHT FOR THEM IF 
THEY DO BADLY IT WILL BE 
AMAZINGLY THE WORST RESULT IN 
LOCAL ELECTIONS FOR FORTY YEARS 
DECONSTRUCT A COUPLE OF PHRASES FOR 
ME THIS WAS ALASTAIR DARLING IN 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE POST MATCH HE SAID I BELIEVE 
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN 
THE LESSONS OF WHAT THE ELECTORATE 
ARE SAYING 
THAT'S A GOOD ONE IF 
THE GENERAL ELECTION IS THOUGHT TO 
BE UP TO TWO YEARS AWAY YOU CAN 
ALWAYS SAY A USEFUL WAKE UP CALL 
THEY HAVE TIME TO SORT IT SOUTH 
YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY AROUND WITH 
TURN OUT THAT'S A PERFECT PHRASE 
ALASTAIR DARLING OF COURSE IS VERY 
GOOD AT THOSE THINGS 
A NIGHT OF 
MIXED RESULTS 
YES IXED RESULTS 
DOES THAT MEAN WE'VE TAKEN A 
MIGHTY KICKING 
MIXED RESULTS 
CAN MEAN ANYTHING IT WAS FAR WORSE 
OR BETTER THAN EXPECTED YOU CAN 
ALWAYS FALL BACK ON LOOK THESE ARE 
LOCAL RESULTS YOU CAN ALWAYS 
BLIND THE INTERVIEWER WITH YES 
IT IT WASN'T QUITE LIKE THAT TURN 
OUT ET CETERA 
I AM SURE A LOT OF 
COLUMN INCHES WILL BE DEVOTED TO 
SAYING COMPARE AND CONTRAST IS 
GORDON BROWN NOW IN THE SAME 
POSITION AS JOHN MAJOR WAS IN IN 
THE MID NINETIES 
I DON'T PERSONALLY 
BUY THAT L. THINK THESE COMPARISONS 
THEY'RE VERY NEAT AND PEOPLE SAY U. 
TURNS AND GO BACK THROUGH ALL THE 
U. TURNS I THINK JOHN MAJOR'S 
POSITION BECAUSE OF THE E. R. M. 
DEBACLE MAY BE FORGOTTEN NOW BUT 
BECAUSE OF HIS WHOLE ECONOMIC 
POLICY IN THE YEAR HE WAS ELECTED 
WAS FLUNG ASIDE THAT WAS A VERY 
DRAMATIC AND PERSONAL DEFEAT OTHER 
PEOPLE MAY SAY THAT DIDN'T MATTER 
BUT IN FACT THE TORIES NEVER 
RECOVERED FROM THAT BECAUSE IT WAS 
PERSONAL AND IT WAS POLICY AND IT 
WAS TO DO WITH THE ECONOMY THAT'S 
QUITE A LOT 
ALL RIGHT THE TORIES MAY SAY IT'S 
THE SAME NOW BUT THERE ISN'T QUITE 
THAT SENSE OF A GREAT BIG ISSUE 
THAT HAS GONE COMPLETELY WRONG FOR 
GORDON BROWN 
THANK YOU 
LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
I'M JOINED FROM NEWCASTLE BY A MAN 
WITH KEEN INTEREST IN THIS WEEK'S 
ELECTIONS THE SHADOW FOREIGN 
SECRETARY WILLIAM HAGUE I'M SURE 
MR. HAGUE YOU WERE LISTENING 
CLOSELY TO WHAT JOHN SERGEANT WAS 
SAYING IT'S NOT THE SAME IS IT 
WHAT LABOUR ARE FACING NOW COMPARED 
TO WHEN YOU WERE A MEMBER OF JOHN 
MAJOR'S ADMINISTRATION 
WELL WE'LL 
SEE AT THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION 
WHETHER IT'S THE SAME THERE'S 
CERTAINLY THE SMELL OF DECLINE AND 
CHRONIC INDECISION AND 
DEMORALISATION ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER OUT 
THERE ON THE DOOR STEPS BE IN NO 
DOUBT ABOUT THAT INCLUDING UP HERE 
IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND PEOPLE 
REALLY DO SPONTANEOUSLY RAISE THE 
ISSUE OF THE TEN P. TAX AS SOON AS 
THEY OPEN THE DOOR THEY EXPRESS 
THEIR DISSATISFACTION WITH GORDON 
BROWN WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET 
RID OF GORDON BROWN AS SOON AS 
THEY OPEN THE DOOR THERE IS A LOT 
OF DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT NOW OUT ON THE DOOR 
STEPS 
O. K. SO LABOUR HAVE COMMITTED STEPS A U. TURN THIS WEEK BUT DOES IT 
REALLY MATTER IF THE GOVERNMENT 
ENDS UP IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND HOW 
THEY GOT RID OF THE WORST BITS OF 
THE POLICY CAUSING THAT ANGER IT'S IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW COMPLETE THIS U. TURN 
HAS BEEN OF COURSE THEY'RE NOW 
VERY UNCLEAR ABOUT WHETHER 
EVERYBODY WHO IS LOSING OUT AS A 
RESULT OF THE ABOLITION OF THE 
DOUBLING OF THE TEN P. TAX IS GOING TO 
BE COMPENSATED AND WHEN THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE COMPENSATED THERE 
COULD BE FURTHER DEBATES ABOUT THIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TOMORROW I 
DON'T THINK PEOPLE WILL BE 
IMPRESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY 
MIGHT GET SOME OF THE MONEY BACK IN 
A YEAR AND A AND A HALF'S TIME 
THEY KNOW GORDON BROWN HAS ONLY 
GIVEN IN ON THIS BECAUSE HE HAD TO 
AND NOT BECAUSE HE WAS PERSUADED 
THAT LOWER PAID PEOPLE WERE BEING 
HIT BY HIS MEASURES BUT BECAUSE HE 
WAS FORCED BY THE CONSERVATIVES AND 
HIS OWN BACKBENCHERS INTO A CHANGE 
OF TACK SO I DON'T THINK HE'LL GET 
A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THAT 
EVEN IF WE ACCEPT WHAT YOU'RE 
SAYING THAT PEOPLE ARE FLOGGING 
SHARES IN GORDON BROWN THEY'RE NOT 
EXACTLY RUSHING TO BUY STOCK IN 
DAVID CAMERON EITHER 
I THINK THEY 
ARE AGAIN WE'LL SEE SOME EVIDENCE 
OF THIS I THINK ON THURSDAY L. 
THINK THEY ARE HERE IN THE NORTH 
OF ENGLAND WE ARE NOW BETTER 
ORGANISED AND MORE ACTIVE THAN WE 
HAVE BEEN FOR MANY YEARS PERHAPS 
SEVERAL DECADES FOR INSTANCE IN 
YORKSHIRE EVERY WARD BEING 
CONTESTED BY A CONSERVATIVE 
CANDIDATE EVEN IN BARNSLEY 
SHEFFIELD AND SO ON CONSERVATIVE 
KAPBLD DATES EVERYWHERE MORALE IS 
VERY HIGH SO I THINK DAVID 
CAMERON AND OUR WHOLE TEAM IN THE 
PARTY ARE STEADILY WINNING SUPPORT 
THAT'S SHOWN IN OPINION POLLS BUT 
MORE IMPORTANTLY IT JUST FEELS 
DIFFERENT OUT THERE WHEN I SPEAK 
TO A STUDENT GATHERING NOW AS I 
DID AT MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO LARGE NUMBERS 
OF STUDENTS TURN UP AND THEY'RE NOT 
THROWING BOTTLES AT THE 
CONSERVATIVE POLITICIAN THEY'RE 
LISTENING THEY'RE ASKING THEY'RE 
BEING SUPPORTIVE MANY OF THEM ARE 
VOTING CONSERVATIVE THERE IS A 
CHANGE STEADILY HAPPENING OUT THERE 
O. K. YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT CHANGE 
THEN GIVE IT YOU HEARD WHAT WE 
WERE SAYING WITH JOHN SERGEANT 
MOMENT AGO HOW MANY GAINS ARE YOU 
GOING TO MAKE 
THERE'S NO POINT 
THAT'S NOT A GAME I'M GOING TO GET 
INTO OF HOW MANY GAINS WE'RE GOING 
TO MAKE AND IT'S A COMPLEX SET OF 
ELECTIONS AS WAS RIGHTLY POINTED 
OUT I THINK WE'LL MAKE GAINS I 
THINK WE'LL MAKE GAINS IN MANY 
PARTS OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AS 
WELL AS THE SOUTH IN PARTS OF THE 
SOUTH THERE ARE NO SEATS LEFT FOR 
THE CONSERVATIVES TO GAIN WE'RE 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THURSDAY NIGHT 
WE'RE GETTING GOOD CANVASSING 
RETURNS IN PARTICULAR WE'RE 
GETTING THEM HERE IN MANY PARTS OF 
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND THAT WILL 
BE A VERY IMPORTANT ADVANCE THAT THAT ANSWER WAS AS MISTY AND VAGUE A Z. 
THE SKY LINE BEHIND YOU THE THE QUESTION WAS WAS VERY SPECIFIC AND 
NOT ONE WE CAN POSSIBLY ANSWER L. 
CAN'T SIT HERE AND SAY WE'LL MAKE 
THIS MANY GAIN AND THIS IS THE 
NUMBER WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE YOU 
KNOW THAT IN ASKING THE QUESTION 
JUST AS I KNOW IT IN ANSWERING THE 
QUESTION 
IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE TO QUESTION GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT YOU THINK 
THE BENCH MARK IS WHERE IS THE BAR 
SET SO WE CAN JUDGE WHETHER IT'S 
BEEN A GOOD NIGHT OR BAD NIGHT FOR 
THE TORIES 
OF COURSE WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO SET A BAR THE EXPERTS 
WILL EXTRAPOLATE FROM THE RESULTS 
WHAT THE EQUIVALENT SHARES OF THE 
NATIONAL VOTE ARE COMPARED TO LAST 
YEAR COMPARED TO THE LAST GENERAL 
ELECTION THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE 
TAKEN AS ONE OF THE INDICATIONS OF 
THESE RESULTS BUT THERE'S NO POINT 
IN SETTING OURSELVES A BAR WE WANT 
TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING FORWARD 
AND I THINK WE WILL BE GOING 
FORWARD BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SET A 
STATISTICAL BAR IN A VERY COMPLEX 
SET OF ELECTIONS 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED 
GAINS 
REALLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GAINS GET ME TO SET A STATISTICAL BAR NO 
POINT IN GOING ON WITH THAT ONE O. K. O. K. TURNING TO A MUCH MORE SERIOUS 
SUBJECT THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE 
THE GOVERNMENT AT THE START THE 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT SEEM TO HAVE A 
SOFTLY SOFTLY APPROACH THIS THEN 
BECAME SLIGHTLY MORE BELLIGERENT 
DO YOU THINK THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
HAS BEEN SENDING MIXED MESSAGES 
OVER THE ELECTIONS IN ZIMBABWE 
THEY DID HAVE SOFTLY SOFTLY 
APPROACH WITH IT AT THE BEGINNING 
BUT I FULLY AGREE WITH WHAT GORDON 
BROWN AND DAVID MILIBAND SAID OVER 
THE LAST FEW WEEKS IT'S IMPORTANT 
THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT FOCUSES 
INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION ON THE 
OUTRAGES TAKING PLACE NOW ON 
ZIMBABWE I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO 
CRITICISING THE GOVERNMENT ON THIS 
I THINK THERE WERE ONE OR TWO 
ADDITIONAL THINGS THEY COULD DO TO 
SEND AN EVEN CLEARER MESSAGE FOR 
INSTANCE I THINK MORAL COULD BE 
DONE NOW TO PREPARE FOR THE DAY 
AFTER MIG MUG TO GET READY TO 
SHOW THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE THAT 
THE WORLD IS READY TO WELCOME THEM 
TO HELP THEM WHEN THEY ARE SET ON A 
PATH TO DEMOCRACY AND TO RESPECTING 
THE RIGHTS OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF 
ZIMBABWE SO I THINK WE COULD DO 
MORE ON THAT SIDE 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S SENDING 
MIXED MESSAGES I THINK THEY'VE 
BEEN SAYING THE RIGHT THINGS OVER 
THE PAST TWO WEEKS 
ALTHOUGH THE 
SITUATION IS TERRIBLY TROUBLING IT 
LOOKS LIKE THESE RECOUNTS ARE 
PROCEEDING IN A WAY CONFIRMING IT 
WOULD SEEM THAT THE M. D. C. WERE THE 
VICTORS 
IT DOES INDEED LOOK LIKE VICTORS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING A BIT 
MYSTIFYING ABOUT THIS OF COURSE 
CLEARLY THE MUGABE REGIME HAS BEEN 
GOING TO GREAT LENGTHS TO HOLD 
THESE RECOUNTS TO HELD THEM IN 
SEATS THAT THE M. D. C. WON THEY SEEM 
TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN A GREAT DEAL OF 
PREPARATION TO RIG THESE RESULTS 
AND THEN NOT SUCCEEDING IN RIGGING 
THE RESULTS ALTERNATIVELY THEY MAY 
BE PLAYING FOR TIME L. THINK 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INTERNAL 
DEBATE IN THE MUGABE REGIME ABOUT 
WHAT ACTUALLY TO DO THERE'S SOME 
EVIDENCE THAT HE WANTED TO GIVE UP 
AND TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT THE 
KEY PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHOSE WHOLE 
INCOME AND STANDING AND LIFE IN 
ZIMBABWE DEPENDS ON MUGABE 
PERSUADED HIM TO STAY THEY MAY BE 
PLAYING FOR A BIT OF TIME IF THEY 
MANAGE TO CONFIRM THEMSELVES IN 
OFFICE WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING 
POSSIBLE TO INTENSIFY THE PRESSURE 
ON THEM THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA AND 
OTHER NEIGHBOURING STATES AND 
THROUGH THE AFRICAN UNION 
WE HAVE 
TO LEAVE IT THERE WILLIAM HAGUE 
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US 
THINK OF AMERICA'S WILD WEST AND 
YOU'LL THINK OF COWBOYS RODEOS AND 
SHOOT OUTS BUT SHOULD WE ALSO 
THINK OF INNOVATIVE IDEAS TO TACKLE 
YOUTH CRIME BEFORE IT EVEN HAPPENS 
THE STATE OF COLORADO RUNS EARLY 
INTERVENTION PROGRAMMES AIMED AT 
PREVENTING CHILDREN BECOMING 
INVOLVED IN CRIME TOMORROW 
NOTTINGHAM WILL FOLLOW BY 
PROCLAIMING ITSELF AN EARLY 
INTERVENTION CITY OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN TO COLORADO 
TO SEE HOW IT WORKS 
COLORADO THE OLD WILD WEST WHERE 
THE ONE TIME HARD BITTEN PIONEERS 
OF AMERICA'S FRONTIER LANDS HAVE 
FOUND A NEW SOFTER FRONTIER TO 
PIONEER PIONEER THE SUNDAY RODEO IT'S HARDLY ASBO 
BRITAIN BUT HERE TOO THEY 
STRUGGLE WITH ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 
THEIR ANSWER NOT CRACKDOWN BUT 
HEM FOR CHILDREN WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG 
THIS ISN'T THE SORT OF PLACE YOU'D 
EXPECT LIBERAL TOUCHY FEELY 
POLICIES FOR DEALING WITH 
YOUNGSTERS THIS IS COWBOY COUNTRY 
WHERE IF ANYTHING YOU'D EXPECT A 
TOUGH NO NONSENSE APPROACH THEY 
DECIDED THAT SIMPLY ISN'T WORKING 
ENTER THE NEW LAW MEN WHO DECIDED 
ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH HIGH POWERED 
ATTORNEYS THEY BEGAN FUNDING 
SCHEMES TO HELP DIFFICULT CHILDREN 
AND STOP THEM ENDING UP ON THE 
WRONG SIDE OF THE LAW 
ONE OF THE THINGS LAWYERS SEE IS 
THE SAME FOLKS THE SAME VIOLATORS 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEY OFTEN 
START AT YOUNG AGE YOU GET THE 
SENSE PRETTY QUICKLY I WAS A 
PROSECUTOR FOR YEARS THAT IT'S TOO 
LATE FOR THOSE KIDS WHEN WE 
STARTED TO LOOK FOR PLACES WHERE 
EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMMES COULD 
PREVENT EVENTUAL CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR 
WE PRETY QUICKLY LANDED ON THE 
NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP 
WHEN WE 
FIRST STARED WE THOUGHT WE'D BE 
DEALING WITH OLDER KIDS AS WE 
STARTED READING THE RESEARCH WE 
ENDED UP PRE NAITLY WHERE WE SAW 
WHERE THE BIGGEST IMPACTS COULD 
HAPPEN WE ENDED UP BEFORE THE 
BABIES ARE EVEN WRONG 
I WANT THE 
PEOPLE MOST AT RISK THE MOTHER 
ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH TO THE CHILD IS 
MOST AT RISK THAT'S WHERE WE CAN 
MAKE THE MOST DIFFERENCE IN THAT 
GENERATION THE FUTURE GENERATION 
WHERE WE CAN MAKE THE MOST 
DIFFERENCE IN COST SAVINGS FOR OUR 
SOCIETY 
AMANDA A YOUNG SINGLE MUM 
RECEIVES REGULAR VISITS FROM 
VALERIE ONE PART OF COLORADO'S 
EARLY INTERVENTION PACKAGE BECAUSE 
SHE MAY STRUGGLE TO BRING UP YOUNG 
NOELEN 
AROUND THE TIME I GOT NOELEN PREGNANT HIS DAD STARTED GETTING 
PHYSICALLY VERBALLY AND 
EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE TOWARDS ME 
BECAUSE I WAS PREGNANT I DIDN'T 
WANT HIM TO GET IN TROUBLE L. 
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING FOR A LONG TIME 
THINGS STARTED GETTING REALLY BAD 
I ENDED UP IN HOSPITAL ONCE L. 
DECIDED THAT I'M NOT GOING TO RAISE 
MY SON IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT I 
GREW UP IN THAT MY SON WAS GOING 
TO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE L. WAS 
GOING TO BREAK THE CYCLE 
VAL CAME TO MY HOUSE I REMEMBER 
THE FIRST DAY 
I MET HER I WAS 
PREGNANT IT WAS NEAT TO HAVE 
SOMEONE ELSE COMING TO MY BROKEN 
HOME AND JUST ENCOURAGING ME SHE 
WAS JUST SUCH A CHEERFUL PERSON TO 
BE AROUND L. DIDN'T HAVE THAT MOM 
TO GO TO AND SAY I'M FEELING SICK 
TODAY WHAT DOES THIS MEAN I 
DIDN'T HAVE THAT BUT I HAD VAL 
THE COLORADO GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
WHERE TAX PAYERS' MONEY IS NOT TO 
BE WASTED 
THE POWER BROKERS HERE ARE A HARD 
HEADED LOT BUT THEY AIM TO SPEND 
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY 
YEAR ON EARLY INTERVENTION BECAUSE 
THEIR FIGURES SHOW IT WILL SAVE 
THEM SIX DOLLARS FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR THEY 
INVEST INVEST IT HAS SAVED SO MANY COSTS IN CHILD 
ABUSE TREATMENT IN PRISON COST IN 
HEALTH CARE FOR THE MOM AND THE 
BABY IN SPECIAL EDUCATION 
PLACEMENTS FOR THE CHILDREN 
THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE IS HUGE 
SAVINGS 
WAS THERE ANY CONCERN FROM SAVINGS PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THAT YOU SHOULD 
NOT BE INTERVENING IN THE LIVES OF 
THE FAMILY THAT THE STATE SHOULD 
STAY OUT OF INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES' 
LIVES 
PEOPLE WERE WORRIED THAT LIVES THERE WOULD BE GOVERNMENT 
INTERVENTION IN THE FAMILY AND THE 
FAMILY SHOULD BE KEPT PRIVATE 
PEOPLE WERE AFRAID THAT IT WOULD 
GROW TO BE A HUGE PUBLIC PROGRAMME 
AND THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK VERY WELL 
WHAT WE WORKED HARD TO DO WAS TO 
MAKE IT VOLUNTARY SO THAT PARENTS 
HAVE TO WANT TO PARTICIPATE AND 
THEN THE GOVERNMENT COULD HELP WITH 
COVERING SOME OF THE COST 
WHAT CHANGED ATTITUDES HERE WAS 
COLUMBINE 
THE AFTERMATH OF ANOTHER COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL MASSACRE AMERICA ASKS 
WHY 
ALONGSIDE THE GRIEVING THE WHY COLUMBINE MASSACRE PROMPTED A 
FUNDAMENTAL RETHINK A 
DETERMINATION IT SHOULD NEVER BE 
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND A 
PUBLIC RECOGNITION THAT IT MADE 
MORE SENSE TO INTERVENE EARLY WHEN 
SUCH CHILDREN WERE SUCH YOUNG THAN 
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE WERE 
STILL YOUNG 
IN THIS CLASS IN NEARBY LITTLETON 
THE RESULT IS THAT THESE CHILDREN 
RECEIVE A VERY DIFFERENT SORT OF 
EDUCATION AT THIS NURSERY SCHOOL 
THEY DON'T JUST TEACH THE SORT OF 
THING AS YOU WOULD EXPECT SUCH AS 
READING AND LEARNING TO SPELL BUT 
THEY ALSO TEACH THE YOUNGSTERS 
ABOUT AND THE MANAGEMENT HANDLING 
THEIR FEELINGS AND LEARNING TO GET 
ON WITH PEOPLE 
I AM JUST A 
LITTLE FRUSTRATED 
MAKE THIS 
RATHER GRUMPY DRAGON WHO IS 
APPARENTLY NOT AVERSE TO ANTISOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR BUT SHE HAS PROVED AN 
EFFECTIVE WAY OF TEACHING THESE 
YOUNGSTERS MOSTLY FROM LOW INCOME 
FAMILIES OR DIFFICULT HOMES HAVE 
HOW TO BEHAVE AND HOW TO CALM DOWN 
OR DIFFICULT HOMES IT IS ONE OF 
A SERIES OF CLASSES RUN THREAD 
PRIMARY SCHOOLS AND HAS PROVED 
HUGELY POPULAR WITH PARENTS THINK THINK OF YOUR HAPPY PLACE IT MIGHT BE 
THE PARK 
THIS IS A VERY 
INTERACTIVE FUN CLASS FOR KIDS WHO 
HAVE HAD A LOT OF ISSUES IN DEALING 
WITH THEIR EMOTIONS AND BEING ABLE 
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND 
UNDERSTAND THEIR ANGER ONE 
COLUMBINE HAPPENED IT BECAME 
APPARENT THAT WE HAD TO DO 
WHEN COLUMBINE WE HAD 
SOMETHING WHEN COLUMBINE WE HAD TO FOCUS ON THE PREVENTION THERE 
ARE SO MANY KIDS ON THE OPPOSITE 
END ENDING UP BEING INCARCERATED 
AND HAVING DRUG AND ALCOHOL 
PROBLEMS AND VIOLENCE ISSUES THAT 
WE NEEDED TO FOCUS WHEN THEY WERE 
YOUNG 
COLORADO THE LAND WHERE THE YOUNG BUFFALO MAY STILL ROAM BUT WHERE 
THEY HAVE WE THOUGHT THE OLD WAYS 
OF DEALING WITH DIFFICULT 
YOUNGSTERS ARE WE THOUGHT THE 
INS AND OUTS OF POLITICS CAN MAKE 
IT DIFFICULT TO RISK TAKING A. O. R. A 
LONG TERM APPROACH BUT SIMILAR 
SCHEMES ARE BEING TRIED IN BRITAIN 
IN COLORADO THEY HAVE DECIDED TO 
EITHER HELP YOUNGSTERS EARLY OR 
RISK THAN TAKING A FALL RISK 
THEM THEM MORE ON OUR WEBSITE LATER I WILL 
KICK OVER THE TRACES OF THIS WEEK'S 
TEN P. TAX ROW WITH THE LIB DEM 
TREASURY SPOKESMAN VINCE CABLE NOW 
YOUR LOCAL SHOW 
THANKS VERY MUCH AND WELCOME WITH 
JUST FOUR DAYS TO GO UNTIL 
LONDONERS GO TO THE POLLS WE HAVE 
THE LAST OF OUR INTERVIEWS WITH THE TODAY IT IS 
THE TURN OF KEN LIVINGSTONE WE 
HAVE HAD TWO HEART FITTED HERE TO 
B. B. C. LONDON STUDIOS FROM CITY HALL 
BECAUSE ITS BASEMENT IS CURRENTLY 
FILLING UP WITH WATER BECAUSE OF A 
HUGE BURST WATER MAIN WE HAVE HAD 
TOO HOT FOR AT IT WE WILL BE 
TRYING TO RESIST ANY CHEAP WATERY 
METAPHORS KEN LIVINGSTONE 
ONLY EVIDENCE WE HAVE OF WHAT A 
LONDON MAYOR CAN DO REJECTED BY 
HIS PARTY INITIALLY HE PRODUCED A 
DEFINING SIGNATURE THAT CAPITAL 
C. FOUR CONGESTION CHARGE IN HIS FIRST 
TERM IN HIS SECOND RECONCILED 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT HE HAS MADE 
THE MOST OF THEIR LARGESSE AND 
LONDONERS' GENEROSITY TO PURSUE A 
BIG PROGRAMME OF INVESTMENT ONES A 
THIRD TERM DESERVED OR HAS HE RAN 
HIS CAUSE WILL RUN HIS COURSE 
HE MADE HIS NAME AS MAYOR BY TAKING 
ON THE LABOUR PARTY AND INTRODUCING 
THE CONGESTION CHARGE AFTER TWO 
THAMES AND EIGHTY YEARS AT CITY HALL 
CAN HE STILL BE SEEN AS THE MAN TO 
SHAKE THINGS UP EIGHTY YEARS BEING 
SEEN AS TIMID WOULD BE A PROBLEM 
FOR HIM EIGHT YEARS HE IS THE 
ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATE IF HE IS 
GOING TO GO FOR A THIRD TERM HE 
HAS TO FIND A WAY OF LOOKING 
DIFFERENT WHAT HAD KEN LIVINGSTONE 
HAVE IN STORE FOR ANOTHER TERM 
WHAT WOULD THE INTRODUCTION OF 
DEDICATED POLICE TEAMS FOR EVERY 
NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS AT THE HEART OF 
HIS CRIME CRUSADE HE SAID IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THAT HE HOPED IT WOULD CUT RECORDED 
CRIME BY FIFTY PER CENT IT HAS GONE DOWN BY 
A LITTLE UNDER TWENTY PER CENT HOWEVER ONE 
REAL CONCERN IS THE RISING YOUTH 
KILLINGS THERE WERE TWENTY SEVEN LAST YEAR 
AND ELEVEN ALREADY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
THE NUMBER 
OF MURDERS IN LONDON HAS DECLINED 
OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS BUT THE 
NUMBER OF MURDERS IN LONDON IN THE 
PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS CAN'S FIRST 
FOUR YEARS WENT UP THE SAME AS 
THE CASE FOR RAPE AND GBH IF YOU 
TAKE AN EIGHT YEAR TERM HIS RECORD 
DOES NOT GO QUITE SO GOOD KEN KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS SECURED LENDING 
FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO DOUBLE 
COUNCIL PROVISION OF YOUTH SERVICES 
HE HAS ALSO PROMISED ONE THOUSAND NEW 
POLICE OFFICERS A CUT OF SIX PER CENT IN 
RECORDED CRIME BY EVERY YEAR AND AN 
EMPHASIS ON TEN CRIME HOT SPOTS ON 
TRANSPORT HE WILL CLAIM TO HAVE 
OVERSEEN MAJOR INVESTMENT 
INCLUDING A RECORD NUMBER OF BUSES 
AND BUS USERS BUT HE HAS BEEN 
ATTACKED FOR BE EFFECT THAT FREE 
TRAVEL FOR AND A TEAMS IS HAVING 
THE EFFECT THERE ARE CONCERNS 
ABOUT BEHAVIOUR AND MINOR CRIME 
BENDY BUSES ARE STILL TO WIN EVERY 
ONE OVER ON THE UNDERGROUND TFL 
HAS TAKEN OVER THE UPGRADING WORK 
ON THE TUBE FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE 
OF METRONET HE HAS ALSO TAKEN OVER 
WHAT IS CALLED THE OVERGROUND RAIL 
ROUTE AND PAID A KEY ROLE IN 
PERSUADING THE GOVERNMENT TO GREEN 
LIGHT GREEN LIGHT CROSSRAIL HE HE HAS MANAGED TO WHEEDLE QUITE A LOT 
OF MONEY FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENT 
FOR CROSSRAIL THE EAST LONDON LINE 
THE THAMES LINK AND SO ON L. DO 
THINK THAT HIS POLICIES LACK AN 
OVERALL VISION 
HIS TRANSPORT 
POLICIES HAVE TAKEN ON A GREEN 
TINGE FEBRUARY SAW THE 
INTRODUCTION OF THE LOW EMISSION 
ZONE CHARGING HEAVY POLLUTERS TO 
DRIVE INTO LONDON HE IS ALSO 
PLANNING A TWENTY FIVE CONGESTION CHARGE ON 
GAS GUZZLERS A POLICY THAT SOME 
THINK THEY ACTUALLY INCREASE 
CONGESTION AS IT IS ALLOWING 
THOUSANDS OF CLEANER VEHICLES TO 
DRIVE IN FOR FREE THINK MAY 
ACTUALLY INCREASE 
HE IS PROMISING SUBSIDISED HOME 
INSULATION RHETT RIVETING OF 
PUBLIC BUILDINGS HE ALSO GOES INTO 
THE ELECTION CLOSELY ALLIED WITH 
THE GREEN PARTY 
TWO MEMBERS HAVE 
BEEN HAVING AN INFLUENCE THROUGH 
THE NEED TO GET HIS BUDGET THROUGH 
THEY HAVE CLEARLY HAD AN INFLUENCE 
AND PROBABLY SPEEDED THINGS UP 
STRENGTH AND THINGS EVEN IF THEY 
ARE NOT NECESSARY THINGS HE WOULD 
NOT HAVE DONE 
ON HOUSING KEN 
LIVINGSTONE SAYS HE WILL CONTINUE 
TO USE HIS POWERS TO ENCOURAGE HALF 
OF NEW FORMS NEW HOMES TO BE 
AFFORDABLE A TARGET WHICH HAS SO 
CAR SO FAR PROVED TOO DIFFICULT 
TO REACH HE IS PLACING MORE 
EMPHASIS ON SOCIALLY RENTED HOMES 
IF KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS RETURNED AS 
MAYOR WE NEED TO SEE THE TARGETS 
THAT ON PAPER ARE BEING MET WE 
NEED REAL BRICKS MORTAR REAL 
PEOPLE AND REAL HOUSES 
SHOULD I 
STAY OR SHOULD I GO 
FEW PEOPLE WOULD DENY THAT HIS 
SECOND TERM HAS BEEN EVENTFUL 
FROM HELPING LONDON TO SECURE THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES THEN NEXT DAY 
SPEAKING IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 
SEVEN SEVENTHS BOMB ATTACKS 
LONDONERS WILL 
NOT BE DIVIDED BY THIS COWARDLY 
ATTACK 
THROUGH TO HIS SUSPENSION ATTACK FROM OFFICE LATER OVERTURNED FOR 
LIKENING A JEWISH JOURNALIST TO A 
CONCENTRATION CAMP GUARDS AND THE 
RESIGNATION OF RACE ADVISER LEE 
JASPER KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS RARELY 
BEEN OUT OF THE HEADLINES AFTER 
TWO TERMS IN OFFICE POLICIES LIKE 
THE CONGESTION CHARGE OR AFFORDABLE 
CZARDAS HOUSING CHARGES ONCE AN 
ATTAINABLE ARE NOW THE STATUS QUO 
DOES HE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 
SOMETHING NEW AND EYE CATCHING TO 
WIN A THIRD TERM 
KEN LIVINGSTONE I THINK IT HAS 
STRUGGLER LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THIS 
CAMPAIGN HAS NOT BEEN AS ENERGETIC 
AS BORIS JOHNSON'S PERHAPS EVEN IN 
TERMS OF IDEAS BUT ALSO GETTING 
AROUND LONDON AND SO ON WHAT YOU 
ACCEPT THAT YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF 
PUFF 
I HAVE SPENT THE LAST SIX PUFF WEEKS ON THE STREETS LITERALLY 
VERY LITTLE TIME AND PARTY 
HEADQUARTERS JUST POPPING IN TO 
CLEAR CONTACT SOME THINGS ALTHOUGH 
IT IS PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTING IT IS 
MENTALLY ENERGISING IN A WAY YOU 
NEVER GET OUTSIDE THE ELECTION YOU 
HAVE THOUSANDS OF LONDONERS TELLING 
YOU WHAT YOU WHAT THEY THINK YOU 
COME BACK REALLY REVIVED AS LONG 
AS YOU GET A GOOD SLEEP OVER THE 
WEEKEND AFTER THE ELECTION WHY WHY IS IT SO CLOSE YOU HAVE ALWAYS 
SAID THAT THIS WOULD BE THE CLOSEST 
FIGHT OF YOUR POLITICAL LIFE WHY 
BORIS JOHNSON IS TO YOUR MIND SO 
INCOMPETENT 
WE HAVE TO TAKE A INCOMPETENT DIFFERENT DECISIONS PUTTING IN 
PLACE A LOT OF NEW EXPENDITURE 
GETTING THE PLACE BACK ON THE BEAT 
WE'RE SEEING CRIME COME DOWN SIX PER CENT A 
YEAR NOW WE WILL HAVE THE 
EXTENSION THE YEAR AFTER THAT 
WHY IS IT SO CLOSE IF YOUR RECORD 
IS SO GOOD AND YOU UP AGAINST AN 
INCOMPETENT CANDIDATE WHICH YOU 
HAVE SAID 
YOU CAN SAY THAT THE 
EAST LONDON LINE WILL BE BUILT DOWN 
TO WEST CROYDON AND CRYSTAL PALACE 
BUT UNTIL PEOPLE GET ON THE TRAINS 
IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THEY DON'T EXPERIENCE THAT 
YOU CAN SAY 
THEY HAVE SEEN LOTS 
OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE ALREADY WHY 
ARE YOU REALLY FIGHTING FOR YOUR 
LIFE YOU SHOULD BE HOME AND DRY 
SHOULDN'T YOU 
THE TORIES HAVE A 
GENUINELY POPULAR CANDIDATE SIXTY PER CENT 
OF LONDONERS CAN NAME HIM WITHOUT 
PROMPTING BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEEN 
HIM ON HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU AS 
THESE DEBATES HAVE GROUNDS DOWN 
THE LATEST POLLS HAVE SHOWN THE 
OVERTAKING BECAUSE I HAVE AN ANSWER 
IN THE DEBATE AND IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO PIN BORIS DOWN 
IT IS QUITE 
STRONG KING STRIKING WAY YOU SAID 
YOU HAD ENSNARED THE GOVERNMENT 
OVER THE OLYMPICS IT WORKED A 
TREAT A BOTTLE WAS MONEY FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT 
YOUR JOB IS TO DO THE GOVERNMENT BEST YOU CAN FEEL CITY NO 
GOVERNMENT FOR THIRTY YEARS HAS 
INVESTED IN THE EAST END BEST 
YOU CAN FOR YOUR CITY YOU COULD 
NEVER PERSUADE THE TREASURY TO GIVE 
YOU TEN P. BILLION TO INVEST IN THE 
EAST END BUT THE OLYMPICS IS A 
SPARE TEN P. BILLION 
TO THINK 
TESSA JOWELL HE SAYS SHE WANTS TO 
STAGE GAMES FOR THEM HER HER RESPONSIBILITY IS FOR THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY MINE IS TO MAKE THE CASE 
FOR LONDON THAT IS WHY THE BETTER 
IDEA WHEN LONDON THE MORE PEOPLE 
OUTSIDE HATE YOU 
IS IT A CON TRICK 
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE 
I. O. C. AND A CON TRICK AGAINST 
LONDONERS 
LONDONERS HAVE DONE VERY LONDONERS WELL THE DEAL WE DID AT THE 
BEGINNING WAS THAT LONDONERS WOULD 
NOT SPEND MORE THAN THIRTY EIGHT P. A WEEK WE 
HAVE STEPPED THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER ENDORSES IT THE LEADER OF 
THE OPPOSITION THE EXTRA COST HAS 
BEEN BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENT THIS IS 
A HUGE PLATFORM FOR BRITAIN WE GET 
THE LEGACY OF THE HOUSING THE 
EXTRA TRANSPORT INVESTMENT HAVING 
OPENED THAT AREA UP IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS 
THAT FOLLOWED WE GET ANOTHER 
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES AND MANY THOUSANDS OF 
JOBS 
IN TERMS OF THE COUNTRY YOU JOBS HAVE OWNED UP TO THAT WILL YOU OWN 
UP TO CONNING LONDONERS OVER FARES 
HOW MUCH THEY HAVE TO PAY ON BUSES 
AND TUBES 
WHEN I WAS ELECTED THE 
BUS FARE IN AND OUT IN INNER 
LONDON WAS ONE POINT SEVEN OH P. IN OUTER LONDON 
IT IS NINETY P. TODAY 
BUT YOU SAID THE 
BUS FARES AND TUBE FARES WOULD NOT 
GO UP THEN YOU PUT THEM UP AND AND AFTER WE GOT THE MONEY IN FROM 
GOVERNMENT WE WERE ABLE TO CUT 
THEM BUS FARES TODAY ARE CHEAPER 
THAN WHEN I WAS ELECTED TUBE FARES 
ARE FIFTEEN PER CENT MORE IN INFLATION 
YOU'RE GOING TO ELECTIONS SAY ONE 
THING AND THEN YOU DO THE OPPOSITE 
SAYING ONE THING 
WE HAVE HAD 
THIS DEBATE A DOZEN TIMES THE 
GOVERNMENT SAID WE WILL ALLOW YOU 
TO BORROW TWO POINT NINE BILLION TO INVEST IN 
TRANSPORT SADLY YOU HAVE TO PAY 
IT BACK BECAUSE THAT INVESTMENT 
HAS LED TO THIS MONTH THERE ARE 
FIVE PER CENT MORE PEOPLE ON THE TUBE THAN 
LAST YEAR THAT GROWTH IN RYDER 
SHIPPER MEANS 
THE ADVANTAGE 
LONDONERS HAVE THIS TIME IS THAT 
LAST AUTUMN YOU SAID PUBLICLY 
FARES WERE NOT GOING TO RISE YET 
PRIVATELY YOU HAD GIVEN A GREEN 
LIGHT TO A TRANSPORT OFFICIALS YOU 
WERE RUMBLED HERE 
EVERY YEAR BOB 
AND PETER SAY THEY WOULD LIKE A 
FARE INCREASE THE JOB OF THE MAYOR 
IS TO SAY NO TRANSPORT OFFICIALS 
WERE ALWAYS LIKE FARE INCREASES ON ON OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH LAST YEAR YOU WHAT 
YOU APPROVE FARE INCREASES IN A 
BUSINESS PLAN FOR TFL ONE WEEK 
LATER YOU TOLD US THERE WOULD NOT 
BE RISES 
TFL OFFICIALS ADMIT TO 
THE MAYOR L. CHAIR THE MEETING BUT 
TURNED INTO A VEIN AT THAT STAGE 
YOU APPROVED AS CHAIR OF THE 
BOARD'S 
I DON'T INTERVENE BOARD'S THEY ARE MAKING A SUBMISSION TO THE 
MOUTH IT COMES TO ME I THEN 
DECIDE 
THEY WERE ABOUT TO PUBLISH DECIDE HIS BUSINESS PLAN IT WAS ONLY WHEN 
THEY HEARD TO SAY THIS PUBLICLY 
THEY WENT WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM HE 
HAS SAID SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY 
WHAT I SAID 
PUBLICLY WAS THE MAYOR'S POLICY 
ONLY THE MAN CAN AGREE A FARE 
INCREASE TFL ALWAYS WANTS ONE 
THIS IS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND 
CONFUSING HAVING SAID PUBLICLY 
FARES WOULD NOT RISE THE TRANSPORT 
COMMISSIONER TWO WEEKS AFTERWARDS 
SAYS THAT JOHN ROSS ONE OF THE 
ADVISERS HAS TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD 
NOT MIND AFFAIRS HAD TO GO UP THIS 
IS TWO WEEKS AFTER YOU TOLD US 
THERE WOULD BE NO RISE 
I HAVE BEEN GIVEN NO SIGNAL THE 
REALITY IS THAT THE MAYOR 
DETERMINES FARES L. LISTENED TO ALL 
THE ADVICE WE LOOKED AT THAT 
ADVICE IT WAS CLEAR TO ME IN THE 
BUDGET THERE WAS NO NEED FOR A FARE 
INCREASE BECAUSE RIDERSHIP IS 
GROWING STRONGLY 
WHY DID YOUR 
ADVISORS NOT TELL TFL TO TEAR UP 
THIS BUSINESS PLAN THAT THEY WERE 
READY TO PUBLISH YOU DIDN'T 
DISABUSE THEM ABOUT THAT THEY 
THOUGHT THEY WERE STILL PUTTING IN 
FARE RISES 
YOU HAVE WEEKS OF 
DEBATE REALLY INTENSE WITHIN THE 
BUREAUCRACY AS YOU DEMONSTRATE TO 
THE OFFICIALS YOU HAVE MORE MONEY 
THAN YOU 
THOUGHT YOU NEEDED L. THOUGHT THE MARKETING BUDGET WAS 
TOO HIGH HAVING REDUCED SPARES THE 
YEAR BEFORE FARES THE YEAR BEFORE 
I COULD SEE NO REASON TO INCREASE 
THEM 
WHEN YOU LET THE LIGHT INTO THEM YOUR ADMINISTRATION AND IT 
ILLUMINATES A TRUE PICTURE AND ONE 
PERHAPS SENSES THAT YOU'RE NOT TO 
BE TRUSTED ON THESE MATTERS SORRY SORRY I'VE GIVEN AN UNDERTAKING THAT 
FARES WON'T INCREASE OTHER THAN IN 
LINE WITH INFLATION I'VE GIVEN THE 
SAME UNDERTAKEN ABOUT COUNCIL TAX 
YOUR TRANSPORT BOSSES ARE THINKING 
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO THEY 
HAVE TO FIND FIFTY MILLION IN CUTS 
COST SAVINGS IT'S FAIR FOR US TO 
ASK WHY DIDN'T THEY FIND THOSE CUT 
SAVINGS IN THE FIRST PLACE BORIS 
JOHNSON HAS BEEN GOING ON ABOUT HOW 
THEY COULD MAKE SAVINGS WHY DIDN'T 
YOU DO THAT ANYWAY 
BECAUSE WE'VE 
MADE SAVINGS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION 
EACH YEAR BY BEARING DOWN YOU 
ALWAYS GET A DRIFT INEFFICIENCIES 
SKREEP IN EVERY YEAR YOU HAVE TO 
SET A TARGET FOR REDUCTIONS THE 
KEY AREA IN THIS IS THAT WE GOT FIVE PER CENT 
MORE IN FARES INCOME BECAUSE 
ALTHOUGH A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THINK 
THE REST OF THE ECONOMY MIGHT BE 
GOING INTO RECESSION IN LONDON 
WE'RE STILL GROWING 
EXCEPT OF 
COURSE T. GOES AGAINST YOUR ARGUMENT 
IF WE'RE ABOUT TO HIT AN ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN YOU'LL GET LESS IN THE 
FARE BOX 
THAT'S WHY IT'S 
INTERESTING TO RECOGNISE THAT THE 
LAST MONTH WE HAVE FIGURES FOR 
MARCH THERE'S FIVE PER CENT INCREASE IN 
RIDERSHIP ON THE TUBE SIX PER CENT WILL WILL THAT HAPPEN IN TWO YEARS' TIME AND 
YOU'VE BOXED THEM BY SAYING NO FARE 
RISES 
THE PREDICTION IS THAT RISES LONDON'S ECONOMY WILL GROW BY FIFTEEN PER CENT 
NEXT YEAR AND THE SAME NEXT YEAR 
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME IN ONE HUNDRED 
YEARS THAT AMERICA GOES INTO 
RECESSION AND WE DON'T GET DRAGGED 
DOWN BEHIND IT 
SOME PEOPLE ARE 
CALLING YOU A BACKDAU STEALING 
POLICIES BORIS JOHNSON SAYS HE'LL 
GIVE FREE TRAVEL FOR VETERANS 
BANNING ALCOHOL ON BUSES HE HAS 
THE FRESH IDEAS 
IF YOU LOOK AT 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER THIS 
ELECTION IF I WIN AS OPPOSED TO 
BORIS IN JUNE WE'LL BRING IN THE 
LOW EMISSIONS ZONE FOR VEHICLES 
OVER THREE AND A HALF TONNES 
REDUCING POLLUTION IN OCTOBER 
WE'LL BRING IN THE CHARGE FOR THE 
GAS GUZZLING VEHICLES IN JUNE 
WE'LL LAUNCH THE MAJOR HOUSE 
BUILDING PROGRAMME 
HE HAS COME A 
LOT WITH THESE IDEAS AND YOU SNAP 
THEM UP 
IF ANYONE COMES UP WITH A 
GOOD IDEA YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAY 
WE'LL NOT USE IT JUST BECAUSE 
BUT YOU SAY IT REASONABLY YOU MUST 
INDICATE AND YOU MUST ACCEPT 
YOU'VE HAD TWO TERMS ACHIEVED A 
LOT EIGHT YEARS POSSIBLY THE TIME 
IS NOW FOR SOMEONE WITH FRESH IDEAS 
TO IMPLEMENT THEM 
BUT HAVE YOU 
EVER BEEN ABLE TO PIN DOWN WHAT 
BORIS' IDEAS ARE L. ASKED HIM IN 
ONE OF THE DEBATES ON FRIDAY 
WHAT'S YOUR POLICY ON THE TUBE 
THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO HE 
SAID I THINK YOU'VE DONE WELL 
WE'LL CARRY ON WITH IT PART OF 
THE PROBLEM WITH BORIS WHICH IS 
WHY I THINK HE HASN'T ENGAGED IN 
THE WAY A LOT OF TORIES SAID HE 
WOULD IS BECAUSE HE'S BEING MICRO 
MANAGED THEY'RE NOT LETTING HIM BE 
BORIS 
LET'S TURN TO THE ISSUE BORIS THIS STATE OF REALLY SERIOUS SERIES 
OF TEENAGE KILLINGS OVER THE LAST 
FEW YEARS THIS REALLY CAUGHT YOU 
ON THE HOP DIDN'T IT NO ONE NO ONE ANTICIPATED SUDDENLY THIS GROWTH IN 
TEENAGE KILLINGS IT GOES IT'S 
GONE AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'VE GONE 
ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND OFFICERS ON THE 
STREETS SO IT ISN'T SIMPLY THAT 
MORE POLICE OFFICERS WILL STOP IT 
YOU HAVE TO STOP THOSE KIDS GETTING 
CAUGHT UP WITH IN GANGS 
YOU NOW 
HAVE A SIXTY MILLION FUND WHY SHOULD 
WE TRUST YOU TO MANAGE L. KNOW THE 
BOROUGHS MIGHT BE MANAGING IT WHY 
DO WE BELIEVE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO 
SUPERVISE THIS YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE 
THROUGH THE LONDON DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCY HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO 
BRING DOWN THIS SPATE OF TEENAGE 
KILLINGS IT HASN'T DONE ENOUGH TO 
FUND THOSE GROUPS 
IT'S NOT THE JOB 
OF THE LONDON DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO 
DEAL WITH CRIME WHAT WE HAVE NOT 
HAD IN THIS CITY IS A PROPER 
PROGRAMME TO GET KIDS OFF THE 
STREETS EFFECTIVELY THAT HAS BEEN 
A BOROUGH RESPONSIBILITY 
IT HAS 
AND IT'S FUNDED BLACK YOUTH GROUPS 
THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO 
TROUBLE OVER THE LA FEW MONTHS AS 
YOU KNOW IT'S THOSE GROUPS WHO ARE 
IN RECEIPT OF MONEY SOME OF THOSE 
CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE 
POLICE YOU PUT MONEY INTO IT AND 
IT WASN'T USED FOR HELPING YOUNG 
PEOPLE 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEVEN PEOPLE GRANTS OUT OF A TOTAL BUDGET OF 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION A YEAR WHAT'S BEEN 
STUNNING ABOUT THE LDA NONE OF YOU 
BELIEVED WE WOULD ASSEMBLE THE LAND 
ON TIME WITH THE C. P. O. NONE OF YOU 
WOULD BELIEVE THE GREAT RANGE THE 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS 
WE'VE CREATED AND PROTECTED BUT 
THE JOB OF YOUTH PROVISION IS THE 
BOROUGH COUNCILS THEY'VE FALLEN 
DOWN ON THE JOB SO I WENT TO 
GOVERNMENT AND SAID I NEED SIXTY 
MILLION HE ENDED UP ADDING TWENTY 
MILLION FROM THE LDA BUDGET WOULD WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT THE REAL CRIME OF 
LEE JASPER YOUR RACE ADVISOR IS 
THAT HE DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING 
ORDEAL WITH THE SERIOUS PROBLEM OF 
YOUTH CRIME AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS 
THAT PUBLICLY SUBSIDY WAS GOING TO 
FRIENDS OF HIS RUNNING THESE 
ORGANISATIONS THE MONEY WASN'T 
GOING DOWN TO HELP THE CHILDREN IT 
WAS GOING INTO THE POCKETS OF 
PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM 
WHOEVER SAW 
THAT SUDDENLY THE NUMBER OF 
TEENAGERS KILLING EACH OTHER WOULD 
DOUBLE THE REALITY IS 
BUT HE WAS 
PUTTING MONEY FOR THOSE PROJECTS 
NO HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE I'VE NOT 
BEEN RESPONSIBLE UNTIL THIS YEARLY 
LAST YEAR THE GOVERNMENT CHANGED 
THE LAW TO FORCE BOROUGHS TO BUILD 
YOUTH PROVISION THEY DON'T TRUST 
THE BOROUGHS WHICH IS WHY THEY GAVE 
THE MONEY TO ME 
IT'S A KEY 
PROJECT 
WE'LL MAKE SURE THEY PUT PROJECT THE MONEY INTO PROJECTS 
ONE OF THE 
KEY PROJECTS BEING INVESTIGATED BY 
THE POLICE BRIXTON BASE HAD TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
MILLION OF PUBLIC MONEY HALF SIX IT 
TO PUBLIC SALARIES ONE TO A FRIEND 
OF LEE JASPER'S NOT TO HIS SISTER 
AND ANOTHER FRIEND THE MONEY 
WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING YOUNG 
KIDS WERE DYING ON THE STREET THE 
MONEY WASN'T HELPING THE CHILDREN 
THE POSITION IS THE LEGAL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUTH PROVISION 
IS WITH THE BOROUGHS ALL ACROSS 
LONDON THEY'VE MANAGED TO SPEND 
JUST SIXTY MILLION SOME BOROUGHS ONLY 
REACH ONE KID IN TWENTY THE BEST 
BOROUGH ONLY REACHES ONE IN THREE 
THAT'S WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
TURNED TO ME TO MANAGE THAT 
PROGRAMME BECAUSE I HAVE THIRTY FIVE YEARS' 
EXPERIENCE IN HOW BOROUGHS WORK 
WHICH ONES ARE LIKELY TO FAIL AND 
WHICH WE NEED TO PUT EXTRA 
RESOURCES INTO 
WOULD YOU ACCEPT 
THAT THAT COMING AS IT DID AT THE 
END OF YOUR SECOND TERM HAS PROVED 
DAMAGING 
LET'S WAIT AND SEE WE'VE DAMAGING HAD A LOT OF ALLEGATION WEEKS OF 
ALLEGATIONS WE HAVE YET TO HAVE 
ANY EVIDENCE WE HAD THE SAME THING 
IN THE RUN UP TO THE ELECTION FOUR 
YEARS AGO MY ASIAN AFFAIRS ADVISOR 
WAS ACCUSED OF ILLEGALITY HE WAS 
COMPLETELY CLEARED NOBODY REPORTED 
THAT OF COURSE 
HAVE YOU 
CONFRONTED IT AND ACCEPTED THE 
POSSIBILITY OF DEFEAT AND WHAT LIFE 
WOULD BE LIKE AFTER DEFEAT YOU YOU DON'T YOU GO INTO THIS TO WIN 
IGNORING THE EVENING STANDARD POLLS 
WHICH I TAKE WITH A PINCH OF SALT 
EVERY OTHER POLL SHOWS ONE PER CENT 
OR TWO PER CENT EITHER WAY A 
COUPLE MORE PER CENT FOR ME IN THE 
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THIS IS TOO 
CLOSE TO CALL AND EVERY LONDONER'S 
VOTE WILL MATTER AND EVERY 
LONDONER'S EXTRA VOTE WILL DENY THE 
B. N. P. A PLACE IN THE ASSEMBLY WHICH 
IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
KEN LIVINGSTONE THANKS VERY MUCH 
INDEED A LIST OF ALL OUR 
CANDIDATES WOULD BE ON OUR WEBSITE 
THE ELECTION IS ON THURSDAY GET 
OUT AND VOTE 
NOW ON THE DAY GORDON BROWN 
DELIVERED HIS LAST BUDGET BUDGET AS 
CHANCELLOR LIBERAL DEMOCRATS STOOD 
ALMOST ALONE IN ATTACKING HIS 
DECISION TO ABOLISH THE TEN P. TAX 
BAND MOST OF THE REST OF THE 
POLITICAL CLASS SEEM NOT TO HAVE 
NOTICED THAT THIS MOVE WOULD HIT 
MILLIONS OF THE POOREST PEOPLE 
AFTER THE BELATED HUE AND CRY THIS 
WEEK THE CLIMB DOWN AND HUMILIATION 
FOR MR. BROWN IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR 
EXACTLY WHAT PACKAGE OF MEASURES 
WOULD BE OFFERED BY THE TREASURY 
AND IF ANY OR ALL OF THEM CAN BE 
BACKDATED TO KICK OVER THE TRACES 
OF THE WEEK I'M JOINED BY THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS' TREASURY 
SPOKESMAN VINCE CABLE AM WELCOME 
THE TEN P. TAX BAND REMAINS ARE YOU 
CLEAR IN YOUR MIND WHO IS GOING TO 
BE NEUTRALLY AFFECTED BY THIS WHO 
WILL STILL BE HIT 
WE KNOW THAT 
ROUGHLY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WERE 
GOING TO LOSE ON AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED A 
YEAR EACH MOST OF THOSE ARE LOW 
PAID PEOPLE WITH VERY LOAM INCOMES 
EVEN AFTER THIS XEN ISATION PACKAGE 
MANY WILL STALE BE LOSERS A BIG 
GROUP IS PEOPLE ON PART TIME 
EARNERS LET'S SAY CARERS EVEN IF 
THEY'RE WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE 
SO THEY GET TEN THEY WILL STILL 
TEN AN HOUR THEY'LL STILL BE 
CAUGHT IN THE BAND THERE ARE WOMEN 
BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY FIVE AGAIN THEY'RE 
BEING PUBLISHED BY WINTER FUEL 
ALLOWANCE WHICH I GET THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE HIT IT'S DIFFICULT TO 
SEE THAT THEY'LL BE PROPERLY 
COMPENSATED MOST OF THESE FIVE 
MILLION WILL STILL BE LOSERS EVEN 
THOSE BEING OFFERED TAX CREDITS 
WHICH IS GORDON BROWN'S FAVOURITE 
MECHANISM MANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 
CLAIM IT WE KNOW THERE'S A VERY 
LOW PICK UP RATE STKPWHRUF GIVEN 
THE GOVERNMENT A MIGHTY KICKING 
OVER THIS 
THEY'VE SEEMED TO HAVE 
STRUCK A CHORD THE PUBLIC THE 
GOVERNMENT IS DOING BADLY WHY 
AREN'T THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS DOING 
BETTER 
WE'RE NOT DOING BADLY THE BETTER POLLS THIS MORNING HAD US ON TWENTY PER CENT 
IT COULD BE HIGHER AND I'D LIKE TO 
SEE IT HIGHER BUT IT'S NOT AT ALL 
BAD I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN OVER 
THE NEXT TWO YEARS IS THAT PEOPLE 
ARE CLEARLY ANGRY WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT THEY MAY GET MORE ANGRY 
BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS 
DETERIORATING THEY'RE LOOKING AT 
THE CONSERVATIVES INITIAL LITTLE 
ASKING IF THESE ARE A CREDIBLE 
GOVERNMENT I THINK THEY'LL FIND 
THEY'RE FLAKY ON SOME SUBJECTS 
PARTICULARLY THE ECONOMY THEN 
THEY'LL LOOK MORE CAREFULLY AT US 
YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S A TOUCH 
COMPLACENT DO YOU THINK THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS GEFPB THE SCALE 
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PROBLEMS ARE 
DOING AS WELL AS YOU HOPED THEY'D 
BE 
WE'RE NOT DOING AS WELL AS I BE HOPED WE'D BE I'M NOT COMPLACENT 
WE CAN DO BETTER AND SHOULD DO 
BETTER THERE IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY 
WE'RE NOT DOING BADLY BUT WE COULD 
DO BETTER 
WHY AREN'T YOU DOING 
BETTER IF YOU'RE DISAPPOINTING 
WHAT IS DISAPPOINTING AT THE 
MOMENT 
I THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF MOMENT US PUTTING IN MORE WORK BEING 
CREDIBLE ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER 
TO PEOPLE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY 
COMES ON TO ME BECAUSE IT IS THE 
THING THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS THE 
ECONOMY IT'S THE JOB OF ME AND MY 
TEAM TO SHOW THAT WE'RE MORE 
CREDIBLE ON ECONOMIC POLICY THAN 
THE CONSERVATIVES ACTUALLY WE ARE 
A LOT OF US HAVE SERIOUS BACKGROUND 
IN THIS AREA AND WE'VE BEEN RIGHT 
ABOUT THE CRISIS IN THE BANKING 
SYSTEM AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE 
ECONOMY BUT WE HAVE A 
COMMUNICATION JOB TO DO 
JUST MARK 
OUR CARD FOR US WE WERE TALKING 
EARLIER ON THE PROGRAMME ABOUT 
EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT ARE YOU 
GOING TO MAKE NET GAINS ON 
THURSDAY 
WE'RE NOT MAKING THURSDAY PREDICTIONS I THINK WILLIAM HAGUE 
GAVE YOU A SENSIBLE ANSWER EARLIER 
ON THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO 
MAKE MEANINGFUL PREDICTIONS IS IS THIS GOING TO BE A TOUGH ELECTION 
NIGHT FOR YOU 
I THINK IT IS GOING 
TO BE QUITE TOUGH WE'RE DEFENDING 
POSITIONS WE WON AT A HIGH POINT 
THEE YEARS AGO AT LEAST IN THOSE 
THREE YEARS AGO AT LEAST IN THOSE 
SEATS REPLACING COUNCILLORS THREE 
YEARS AGO 
I THINK YOU WILL MADE 
ONE NET GAIN LAST YEAR BERPL THAN 
THAT 
NO I'M 
BETTER THAN THAT I'M THAT I'M NOT GETTING INTO QUANTITIES NOT NOT EVEN THAT 
LET ME EXPLAIN WHEN YOU 
TALK ABOUT NET GAIN OF SEATS YOU 
HAVE SOME VERY BIG URBAN SEATS 
SOME SMALL RURAL SEATS WE'VE 
REALISED THAT GETTING INTO THAT 
PREDICTION GAME ISN'T HELPFUL I I WANT TO QUICKLY TALK ABOUT THE 
DISPUTE AT GRANGEMOUTH AND OF 
COURSE YOU ONCE WORKED FOR SHELL 
SO KNOW QUITE A BIT ABOUT THE OIL 
INDUSTRY WHAT IS THE ROLE OF 
GOVERNMENT IN THIS SHOULD THE 
GOVERNMENT BE INTERVENING DIRECTLY 
TO TRY TO BRING THE TWO SIDES 
TOGETHER TO FORCE A RESOLUTION THE THE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T BE 
TAKING SIDES IN AN INDUSTRIAL 
DISPUTE THEY SHOULD BE ACTIVE IN 
GETTING THE SIDES TOGETHER BECAUSE 
A LOT OF DAMAGE IS BEING DONE IT 
ISN'T SIMPLY THE EFFECTS OF THE 
STOPPAGE BECAUSE THERE ARE KNOCK 
ON EFFECTS THE PIPELINE WILL BE 
CLOSED FOR MUCH LONGER PERIODS WE 
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF COLLATERAL 
DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY L. DON'T 
THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAD 
APPRECIATED THAT THIS WAS ACTUALLY 
A LINE THAT TAKES ROUGHLY A THIRD 
OF THE BRITISH CRUDE OIL NO THE 
JUST THE PRODUCTS OF THE REFINED 
OIL A LOT OF DAMAGE IS BEING DONE 
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT ALSO HAS TO BE 
READY WITH IF THIS SPREADS AND WE 
GET SHORTAGES THAT THEY ARE ABLE 
TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE IN THE 
SHORT RUN IMPORTS OF PRODUCTS AND 
MAYBE EVENTUALLY HAVING TO USE SOME 
OF THE BIG STRATEGIC RESERVE THAT 
THE COUNTRY HAS GOT TO MAKE SURE 
THERE'S ADEQUATE SUPPLY THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS A RULE BUT ROLE 
BUT IT HASN'T TO TAKE SIDES IN THE 
DISPUTE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED DISPUTE FOR BEING WITH US THAT'S IT FOR 
THIS WEEK NEXT WEEK WE'LL BE 
TALKING ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS WHAT ELSE THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WULS BYE
