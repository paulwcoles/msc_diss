IN NINETEEN OH EIGHT THE FRENCH FINANCIER AND INDUSTRIALIST ALBERT KAHN 
LAUNCHED ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECTS IN PHOTOGRAPHY'S HISTORY 
HE RECRUITED A TEAM OF PHOTOGRAPHERS AND SENT THEM AROUND THE WORLD 
TO PRODUCE A PHOTOGRAPHIC INVENTORY OF LIFE ON THE PLANET 
DRIVEN BY THE IDEALISTIC BELIEF 
THAT KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER CULTURES WOULD PROMOTE PEACE AND INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING 
KAHN DREW ON HIS IMMENSE PRIVATE FORTUNE TO EQUIP HIS TEAM WITH THE LATEST PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY 
THEY USED THE AUTOCHROME THE WORLD'S FIRST USER FRIENDLY SYSTEM 
CAPABLE OF TAKING TRUE COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS 
IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWO DECADES 
KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS SHOT OVER SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND AUTOCHROMES 
AND AROUND ONE HUNDRED HOURS OF FILM FOOTAGE 
SOME OF THE PHOTOGRAPHERS' FINEST WORK WAS SHOT IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
A PERIOD WHEN OLD EMPIRES DISINTEGRATED 
NEW TECHNOLOGIES TRANSFORMED THE WAY WE LIVED 
AND EUROPE STRUGGLED TO REBUILD ITSELF 
AFTER THE CHAOS AND CARNAGE OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTEEN PARISIANS CELEBRATED THE ARMISTICE 
THAT BROUGHT THE WAR WITH GERMANY TO AN END 
A CORRESPONDENT FOR THE TIMES REPORTED THAT PARIS WENT CHARMINGLY OFF HER HEAD 
THE WHOLE CITY RESOUNDS WITH CHEERS AND THE MARSEILLAISE 
ALBERT KAHN'S CAMERAMEN WERE PRESENT ON THE BOULEVARDS 
RECORDING THE SCENES OF JUBILATION 
THAT FOOTAGE IS FASCINATING BECAUSE IT CAPTURES THE OUTPOURING OF TREMENDOUS EMOTION PENT UP FEELINGS 
AT THE SIGNATURE OF THE ARMISTICE 
AFTER FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP 
SUFFERING LOSS OF LOVED ONES 
I THINK VERY FEW OF US WILL EVER LIVE THROUGH A MOMENT LIKE THAT 
IN THE CAPITAL THE REVELLERS CELEBRATED ON STREETS 
LINED WITH THE GUNS AND AEROPLANES CAPTURED FROM THE GERMANS 
YET AS PARISIANS REJOICED IN THE STREETS 
GRISLY SCENES WERE UNFOLDING JUST A FEW MILES AWAY 
THE BATTLEFIELDS OF THE WESTERN FRONT HAD BEEN TURNED INTO A GIANT GRAVEYARD 
KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS DOCUMENTED THE HARROWING DISCOVERIES 
MADE BY THOSE WHO RECOVERED THE BODIES OF THE FALLEN SOLDIERS 
YOU CAN SEE A SHELL HOLE AND INSIDE HUMAN REMAINS STILL IN UNIFORM 
THIS SORT OF IMAGE 
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE ARCHIVE DURING THE WAR 
AS IT COULD HAVE HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MORALE 
BUT AFTER THE WAR SUCH AN IMAGE IS SEEN AS PART OF THE RECORD 
IT'S VIEWED WITH THE SAME MINDSET AS THE IMAGES THAT DOCUMENTED THE RUINS 
AND DEMONSTRATED THE CHANGES THAT AFFECTED SOCIETY BECAUSE OF THE WAR 
IT WOULD'VE BEEN A DAILY EVENT FOR PEOPLE WHO RETURNED TO THE RUINS 
TO ENCOUNTER THE DEAD THEMSELVES 
AND THERE'S REAL TENSION BETWEEN RECONSTRUCTION AND REMEMBRANCE 
BECAUSE FARMERS WANT TO RESTORE THEIR EARTH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO PRODUCTIVITY 
AND IF THEY COME ACROSS BODIES THEY MUST INFORM THEIR MAYOR 
THAT THERE ARE BODIES IN THEIR FIELDS WHICH NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED AND HAVE GRAVES DUG FOR THEM 
THEREFORE DO THEY DO WHAT IS MORALLY AND LEGALLY RIGHT 
OR DO THEY PLOUGH THESE BODIES BACK INTO THE LAND 
SO THEY CAN RESTORE THEIR EARTH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
THE FAMILIES OF THE WAR DEAD WERE EXPECTED TO PAY FIFTEEN FRANCS FOR THE EXHUMATION OF THEIR LOVES ONES 
ANOTHER FIFTEEN FRANCS WAS LEVIED FOR TRANSPORTING THEIR REMAINS 
AND A FURTHER TWENTY FRANCS WAS NEEDED FOR EACH BURIAL 
GRAVEDIGGERS WERE UNCOVERING AROUND TWENTY BODIES A DAY 
IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
MOST OF THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HIGHLY PAID 
BUT WOULD HAVE HAD TO GET DRUNK BEFORE THEY STARTED WORK 
BECAUSE OF THE STENCH THAT CAME 
FROM ROTTING CORPSES ON THE BATTLEFIELD 
MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION SERVICEMEN WERE KILLED DURING THE GREAT WAR 
THE CONFLICT WOULD TRANSFORM EUROPE FOR EVER 
IT'S A LANDSCAPE OF TOTAL DEVASTATION 
IN REGIONS SUCH AS THE SOMME 
THIRTY MILLION CUBIC METRES OF EARTH WOULD BE REQUIRED 
TO FILL THE TRENCHES MAZES DUG OUTS AND SHELL HOLES 
WHICH REMAINED AFTER WORLD WAR ONE 
THERE ARE MANY THOUSANDS OF TONS OF UNFIRED SHELLS IN THE EARTH THERE ARE DEAD BODIES 
THERE IS BARBED WIRE ON THE WESTERN FRONT 
SUFFICIENT TO WRAP ROUND THE EQUATOR SEVEN AND A HALF TIMES 
THIS HAD BEEN THE FIRST WAR TO BE FOUGHT IN THE AIR 
IN THE MONTHS AFTER THE ARMISTICE 
KAHN'S FILM MAKERS USED THE RECONNAISSANCE AIRSHIPS FLOWN DURING THE CONFLICT 
TO FILM THE DEVASTATION OF FRANCE 
THEIR CAMERAS FILMED A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY KILOMETRE SWATHE OF DESTRUCTION 
OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BUILDINGS HAD BEEN REDUCED TO RUBBLE 
IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT RECONSTRUCTION WOULD TAKE AT LEAST TEN YEARS 
AND COST BILLIONS OF FRANCS 
FRANCE DEMANDED COMPENSATION FROM GERMANY 
FOR THE IMMENSE DAMAGE INFLICTED ON HER NORTH EASTERN TERRITORIES 
ALTHOUGH THE ARMISTICE WAS SIGNED IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
IT TOOK UNTIL THE FOLLOWING SUMMER 
FOR THE TERMS OF THE PEACE TREATY TO BE FINALISED 
ON JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH NINETEEN NINETEEN DELEGATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
GATHERED AT THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES NEAR PARIS 
FOR THE SIGNING OF THE TREATY 
KAHN WAS GRANTED PERMISSION TO SEND A CAMERAMAN 
INTO THE FAMOUS HALL OF MIRRORS AT VERSAILLES 
WHERE DELEGATES GATHERED FOR WHAT WOULD BE A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN TWENTIETH CENTURY HISTORY 
FOR ALBERT KAHN TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEND CAMERAMEN INTO VERSAILLES 
TO FILM THE SIGNING OF THE PEACE TREATY 
AND THE DOCUMENT UP CLOSE SHOWS THAT HE WAS EXTREMELY WELL CONNECTED 
VERY FEW PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A POSITION TO DO THAT 
BUT THE TERMS OF THE TREATY LEFT THE GERMAN DELEGATION ANGRY AND HUMILIATED 
WHEN THE TREATY HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO THEM INITIALLY 
THEY HAD PROTESTED ON SEVERAL GROUNDS 
AND HAD BEEN TOLD BASICALLY THEY HAD TWO CHOICES 
ONE WAS TO SIGN THE TREATY AND ACCEPT GERMAN RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR STARTING THE WAR AND PAYING FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF EUROPE 
OR THEY COULD GO HOME AND HOSTILITIES WOULD RE COMMENCE 
WITH THE ALLIED ARMIES ON THE BORDERS OF GERMANY READY TO MARCH TO BERLIN 
THE TREATY REQUIRED GERMANY TO RETURN THE DISPUTED TERRITORIES OF ALSACE AND LORRAINE TO FRANCE 
WHITTLE DOWN ITS ARMY TO JUST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TROOPS 
AND PAY HUGE REPARATIONS IN CASH OR INDUSTRIAL GOODS 
THE MEASURES WERE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT GERMANY WOULD BE INCAPABLE 
OF WAGING WAR FOR YEARS TO COME 
IN CREATING THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS 
THE PEACE CONFERENCE DEVELOPED AN INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTION 
DESIGNED TO MAKE ALL WAR A THING OF THE PAST 
KAHN WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTER OF THIS IDEA 
DURING THE WAR HE HAD WRITTEN 
BY EMBRACING A NEW WAY OF THINKING WE CAN PUT AN END TO WAR AND USHER IN PEACE 
TO REPRODUCE OLD MISTAKES WILL KEEP US IN A STATE OF CHAOS 
DARKNESS ANARCHY AND DESTRUCTION 
ALBERT KAHN WAS A LIBERAL PACIFIST 
WHO VIEWED WAR IN SOME SENSE AS DEEPLY DISTURBING AS AN OUTRAGE 
AND THAT I THINK IS WHY ALBERT KAHN WAS SUCH A COMMITTED SUPPORTER OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS 
AND WHY HE DEVOTED HIS FILM MAKING PROJECTS 
TOWARDS TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THAT NEW PEACE WAS BUILT 
AT VERSAILLES GERMANY HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO ACCEPT THE AUTHORITY OF THE LEAGUE 
EVEN THOUGH THEIR MEMBERSHIP HAD BEEN DISALLOWED 
TO ADD FURTHER INJURY TO THIS HUMILIATION 
GERMANY HAD LOST TWELVE PER CENT OF HER TERRITORIES 
ONE OF HER CONCESSIONS WAS THE PROVINCE OF ALSACE 
WHICH GERMANY HAD SEIZED FROM FRANCE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE 
FOR ALBERT KAHN THESE IMAGES HAD A SPECIAL RESONANCE 
HE HAD BEEN BORN IN ALSACE AND AS A BOY 
HE'D WITNESSED GERMANY'S ANNEXATION OF THE TERRITORY IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE 
NOW NEARLY HALF A CENTURY LATER 
KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS WOULD RECORD THE RETURN OF HIS HOMELAND 
TO HIS BELOVED FRANCE 
I'M PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY THIS PHOTO THIS IS THE FUTURE OF ALSACE 
THE NEW GENERATION SMALL CHILDREN WHO WERE GOING TO BE FRENCH 
THE IRONY IS AS YOUNG ALSATIANS THEY WOULD HAVE ONLY SPOKEN GERMAN 
THEIR PARENTS SPOKE ALSATIAN GERMAN THEY WERE TAUGHT GERMAN AT SCHOOL 
YET ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF NOVEMBER THEIR GERMAN SPEAKING TEACHER WAS SACKED 
AND THE NEXT DAY A FRENCH SPEAKER FROM THE INTERIOR OF FRANCE 
CAME INTO THE CLASS AND ADDRESSED THE BEWILDERED CHILDREN IN FRENCH 
KAHN WAS ANXIOUS TO DOCUMENT THE IMPACT OF THE WAR ON FRANCE 
HE WAS EQUALLY DETERMINED TO RECORD THE EFFECT 
ON HIS COUNTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT WARTIME ALLY 
IN BRITAIN IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN NINETEEN 
THE FLAGS OF THE ALLIED POWERS WERE DISPLAYED ALL OVER CENTRAL LONDON 
IN READINESS FOR OFFICIAL CEREMONIES 
TO CELEBRATE VICTORY AND TO REMEMBER THE DEAD 
THIS EARLY MORNING SHOT OF OXFORD STREET SHOWS THE VICTORY STATUES 
THAT HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE RETAILER GORDON SELFRIDGE 
AND MOUNTED OUTSIDE HIS FAMOUS DEPARTMENT STORE 
A LOT OF THE PICTURES TAKEN 
EITHER A FEW DAYS BEFORE OR A FEW DAYS AFTER THE VICTORY PARADE 
THE CITY IS INCREDIBLY DESERTED 
THERE'S A SIMPLE TECHNICAL EXPLANATION FOR THIS 
THE LONG EXPOSURE TIMES MAKE ALL MOVING THINGS DISAPPEAR 
BUT THEN THERE'S A REALLY USEFUL EMOTIONAL QUALITY TO THAT 
YOU KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS REALLY NOTHING SHORT OF APOCALYPTIC 
YOU JUST GET THIS REAL SENSE OF IT BEING A LAND 
WHERE THERE'S THIS PALL OF DEATH HANGING OVER THE CITY 
ON THE NINETEENTH OF JULY NINETEEN NINETEEN 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS FROM FOURTEEN ALLIED NATIONS SET OFF FOR A TWO AND A HALF HOUR LONG PARADE 
THROUGH THE STREETS OF LONDON 
THIS FOR ME IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE PICTURES FROM THE ARCHIVE 
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE PICTURES OF THAT PERIOD 
I THINK I'VE EVER SEEN 
THERE'S THIS GREAT ARMY OF SOLDIERS WALKING THROUGH LONDON 
AND ALTHOUGH THEY'RE THERE TO RECEIVE THE TRIBUTE OF THE CROWD 
THEY'RE ALSO THERE TO OFFER TRIBUTE TO THE DEAD 
AND WHAT MAKES IT SO REMARKABLE IS BECAUSE OF THE LONG EXPOSURE TIME 
WHAT IS A MARCHING COLUMN OF MEN JUST BECOMES THIS WEIRD RIVER 
FLOWING THROUGH THE BANKS OF SPECTATORS 
SO THE PICTURE BECOMES A PICTURE OF THE MISSING 
OF THOSE WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT BACK 
ON WHITEHALL THE PARADE FILED PAST A NEW MONUMENT TO THE DEAD 
ORIGINALLY THE CENOTAPH 
WASN'T INTENDED TO BE A PERMANENT STRUCTURE 
BUT IT WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POTENT AND SYMBOLIC 
OF ALL BRITISH LANDMARKS 
THE GOVERNMENT ACUTELY AWARE OF THE COST OF THE WAR 
HAD ASKED THE GREAT SOCIETY ARCHITECT SIR EDWIN LUTYENS 
TO DESIGN A TEMPORARY MONUMENT WHICH WOULD PLACE THE DEAD 
AT THE HEART OF THE VICTORY COMMEMORATION 
AND OF COURSE THE CENOTAPH IS AN EMPTY TOMB 
SO THE DEAD WERE THERE RIGHT AT THE HEART OF THE COMMEMORATION FROM THE START 
IT WAS CALCULATED THAT IF ALL OF THE EMPIRE'S MILLION DEAD 
MARCHED FOUR ABREAST DOWN WHITEHALL 
IT WOULD TAKE THEM THREE AND A HALF DAYS TO CLEAR THE CENOTAPH 
THE MONUMENT THAT WAS USED DURING THE COMMEMORATIONS 
CAPTURED BY KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS WAS A PLASTERBOARD MODEL 
NOT THE PORTLAND STONE EDIFICE THAT STANDS THERE TODAY 
THE PHOTOGRAPH IS VERY INTERESTING 
BECAUSE IT SHOWS US THESE BANKS OF FLOWERS AROUND IT 
SO THAT BY POPULAR ACCLAMATION THE GOVERNMENT REALISED 
THAT IT HAD TO TURN THIS TEMPORARY MONUMENT 
INTO THE PERMANENT CENOTAPH THAT WE HAVE TODAY 
I SEE IT AS THE MOST POWERFULLY SACRED MONUMENT 
IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IN BRITAIN 
THE WORD IS TO THE GLORIOUS DEAD 
IT WAS A STATEMENT SAYING THAT WE GLORIFY THOSE WHO DIE IN WAR 
AND WE DO NOT GLORIFY WAR ITSELF 
LIKE BRITAIN FRANCE HAD RESOLVED TO MARK THE SACRIFICE OF ITS SERVICEMEN 
IN THE YEARS AFTER THE WAR 
NO FEWER THAN THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND WAR MEMORIALS WERE BUILT 
IN TOWNS AND VILLAGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
THE MOST AMBITIOUS WAS CONSTRUCTED AT VERDUN 
THE SCENE OF ONE OF THE BLOODIEST CONFRONTATIONS OF THE WAR 
DURING THREE HUNDRED DAYS OF FIGHTING 
AN ASTONISHING TWENTY SIX MILLION SHELLS 
RAINED DOWN ON THE GERMAN AND FRENCH TROOPS WHO FOUGHT HERE 
AT DOUAUMONT ON THE VERDUN BATTLEFIELD 
SITE OF SOME VERY FIERCE FIGHTING 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FRENCH WAR MEMORIALS WAS SET UP AFTER THE WAR 
IT IS BUILT IN THE FORM OF A BRETON CHURCH TOWER 
WITH A LIGHT AT THE TOP OF IT 
IT COMMEMORATES INSIDE THOSE WHO FOUGHT AT VERDUN 
THE MISSING OF VERDUN THOSE WHOSE BODIES WERE NEVER FOUND 
INSIDE THE NAMES AND RANK OF THOSE WHO MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE ARE CARVED IN STONE 
WHILE IN THE BASEMENT LIE THE SKELETAL REMAINS 
OF OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND UNIDENTIFIED SOLDIERS 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY THE KAHN ARCHIVE DOCUMENTED THE CREATION OF DOUAUMONT'S OSSUARY 
INITIALLY THE REMAINS OF THOSE WHO DIED AT VERDUN 
WERE STORED IN THIS SIMPLE WOODEN BARRACK 
THIS SACRALISATION OF THE GREAT BATTLEFIELD OF FRANCE IS SOMETHING THAT HAD TO BE IN THE ARCHIVE 
BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGACY OF THE WAR 
WAS ITS MONSTROUS CAPACITY TO KILL 
ANYONE WHO HAD A PACIFIST VISION AS KAHN DID WOULD GO TO DOUAUMONT 
BECAUSE TO GO THERE IS TO REALISE THAT WAR IS IMPOSSIBLE UNTHINKABLE 
BY NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN A MORE ELABORATE BUILDING HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED 
WHICH BY NIGHT LENDS A HAUNTING POWER TO THE MEMORIAL 
TOURING NORTHERN FRANCE BECAME A MACABRE PILGRIMAGE 
AS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CAME TO SEE THE LEGACY OF WAR 
A SORT OF WAR TOURISM DEVELOPED ALBERT KAHN CAME TO THESE PLACES 
TO WITNESS THE SCALE OF THE DEVASTATION 
LOCAL PEOPLE OFTEN RESENTED THIS MORBID CURIOSITY 
THERE WERE TWO TYPES OF DAY TRIPPERS 
AS FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED 
THE GENUINE PILGRIMS WHO WOULD GO TO THE SITES OF MEMORY 
OR WHO CAME TO SEARCH FOR THE GRAVE OF A LOST LOVED ONE 
BUT THERE WAS A VOYEURISTIC ELEMENT 
RETURNEES TO THE RUINS WHO HAD SUCH A HARD TIME IN THE INTERIOR 
WERE APT TO SEE THE PEOPLE COMING IN TRAINLOADS ACROSS THE RUINS 
AS REAL VOYEURS WHO WERE COMING SIMPLY TO VIEW THE FREAK SHOW 
TO LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO THEY HAD HEARD DESCRIBED AS SAVAGES 
AMONGST ALL THE FILTH OF THE WESTERN FRONT 
BUT THE FRENCH NATION'S IMPULSE TO REMEMBER ITS DEAD 
WOULD BE REPLACED BY A NEW DESIRE TO FORGET THE HORRORS OF THE PAST 
KAHN'S CINEMATOGRAPHERS RECORDED THE LIGHTENING OF THE MOOD 
BY FILMING HERE AT THE CHIC FRENCH HOLIDAY RESORT OF DEAUVILLE NEAR LE HAVRE 
DEAUVILLE REPRESENTED PARIS BY THE SEA 
JUST AS BRIGHTON WAS LONDON BY THE SEA SO THAT WAS DEAUVILLE 
DEAUVILLE HAD HORSE RACING POLO AND THE CASINO 
AND THIS LOVELY BEACH 
IT WAS AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE WENT TO BE ON HOLIDAY 
IT WAS ONLY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY KILOMETRES FROM PARIS 
AN EASY DRIVE BY AUTOMOBILE 
AND THAT IS THE WAY THAT DEAUVILLE IS SEEN 
AS A DAY OUT AS A LONG WEEKEND 
OR AS A HOLIDAY PLACE DURING THE SUMMER 
IN PARIS THE CAPITAL'S LEGENDARY NIGHT LIFE WAS REVIVED 
AFTER THE RESTRAINT OF THE WAR YEARS 
THE CITY OF LIGHT GLITTERED ONCE MORE 
AS PARISIANS FLOCKED TO THE CITY'S DANCE HALLS 
WELL BECAUSE DANCING WAS A SPONTANEOUS EXPRESSION OF FREEDOM 
YOU EXPRESSED THAT KIND OF FASCINATION WITH BEING ALIVE 
WITH REDISCOVERING PEOPLE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX 
OF GETTING CLOSE TO THEM OPENLY FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IT HAD BEEN FROWNED ON DURING THE WAR 
IT HAPPENED BUT IT HAD BEEN COVERT NOW IT WAS OVERT 
MAGIC CITY WAS A VERY POPULAR DANCE HALL 
AND THE FOOTAGE IS INTERESTING 
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF WOMEN DANCING WITH OTHER WOMEN 
AND THIS REMINDS US OF AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL FACT 
AS A RESULT OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
THERE WEREN'T A LOT OF MEN OF DATEABLE OR MARRIAGEABLE AGE AROUND 
AS WELL AS RECORDING EUROPE AT PLAY 
KAHN'S CINEMATOGRAPHERS SPENT THE POST WAR YEARS 
OBSERVING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS THAT WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD 
DURING THE WAR FRANCE HAD PRODUCED AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF AEROPLANES 
AND AVIATION MANUFACTURING WAS AT A HEIGHT IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
AND SO THERE WAS THIS GREAT SHIFT OF AVIATION 
FROM THE MILITARY SECTOR INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
AND THE FASCINATION WITH FLIGHT 
REMAINS ONE OF THE HIGHEST IF YOU LIKE LEGACIES 
OF THE MODERNITY OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
THOUGH KAHN WAS INTRIGUED BY PROGRESS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
HE WAS JUST AS FASCINATED BY ANCIENT TRADITIONS AND WAYS OF LIFE 
WAR TURNED EVERYTHING ON ITS HEAD AND THAT WAS WHAT KAHN RECORDED 
BUT WHEN THE WAR ENDED 
KAHN'S PROJECT RETURNED TO ITS IDEA OF PROMOTING PEACE 
AND DOCUMENTING THE COUNTRYSIDE AND DAILY LIFE 
IN FRANCE THROUGHOUT THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AGE OLD WORKING PRACTICES 
SUCH AS COLLECTING MUSSELS OR HARVESTING GRAPES 
WERE LOVINGLY PRESERVED IN KAHN'S ARCHIVES OF THE PLANET 
AFTER THE TERRIBLE TRAUMA OF WAR 
HIS PHOTOGRAPHERS WITNESSED THE RETURN 
OF THE TRADITIONAL HARMONIES OF RURAL LIFE 
GETTING BACK TO THE LAND WAS A DREAM MOST FRENCH SOLDIERS HAD 
WHEN THEY WERE IN THE TRENCHES 
WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE LAND AND STARTED TO BUILD UP AGAIN THE LIVES 
INTERRUPTED BY MILITARY SERVICE WE CAN SEE A PRIDE AND A SKILL 
AND A PARTNERSHIP VERY FREQUENTLY WITH WOMEN WORKERS 
WHICH WASN'T THERE BEFORE THE WAR 
THESE AMAZING COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS 
SHOW THE OBSESSION IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES WITH THE RETURN TO THE LAND 
VERY MUCH A THEME OF FRANCE IN THE TWENTIES 
AS IT HAD BEEN DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
THE ETERNAL PEASANT THE VALUES OF LA FRANCE PROFONDE 
SOMETHING WHICH WAS THERE AT THE VERY BACKBONE 
OF THE FRENCH MILITARY ENDEAVOUR AND THE VICTORY OF NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
KAHN'S ARCHIVE HAD BORNE WITNESS TO THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
WHO HAD SURVIVED THE CARNAGE OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
HIS IMAGES CAPTURE THE EMOTIONAL AND POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE CONFLICT 
AND EUROPE'S RECOVERY FROM THE GREATEST WAR THE WORLD HAD KNOWN 
THE TWENTIES ARE EXCEPTIONAL FOR ALBERT KAHN 
FOR HIM IT'S THE DECADE OF HOPE 
THE WORLD IS IN THE THROES OF TRYING TO FIND A LASTING PEACE 
PROSPERITY IS GRADUALLY RETURNING 
AND THE ARCHIVE CAPTURES THE GREAT DIVERSITY AND WEALTH OF THIS PERIOD 
IN BRITAIN AND FRANCE 
ALBERY KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS OBSERVED ORDINARY PEOPLE 
STRIVING TO MAKE SENSE OF A CONFLICT 
THAT LEFT HOMELANDS SHATTERED AND FAMILIES DEVASTATED 
THEY'D DEFEATED A POWERFUL ENEMY BUT IN BOTH NATIONS 
THE WAR HAUNTED THE MINDS AND SCARRED THE LIVES OF A GENERATION
