TSUNAMI THIS TIME THOUGH IT'S 
DIFFERENT WE CAN'T GO TO BURMA SO

ONE PLANE WAS ALLOWED TO LAND THERE 
TODAY BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH AN

YOU BEENING OUT MORE THAN A 
MILLION PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING TO EAT

NEXT THE OLYMPIC FLAME ITS 
TRAVELS ACROSS THE WORLD WERE MEANT 
TO DRUM UP SUPPORT AND PASSION FOR 
THE OLYMPICS BEING HELD IN BEIJING 
LATER THIS YEAR INSTEAD IT MADE 
HEADLINES FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS 
AS PROTESTERS INTERRUPTED ITS ITS 
JOURNEY YESTERDAY IT HAD A NEW 
CHALLENGE TO REACH THE TOP OF THE 
WORLD THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT EVEREST 
IS AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD AT 
NEARLY NINE THOUSAND METRES HIGH IT'S 
DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS PLACE TO 
GET TO BEFORE THE SUN ROSE IN 
NEPAL THIS MORNING TEAM OF NINETEEN 
CLIMBERS SET OFF FOR THE TOP 
CARRYING THE OLYMPIC FLAME ROCKET 
SCIENTISTS HAD TO CREATE SPECIAL 
TORCHES TO KEEP THE FLAME ALIVE IN 
THESE ICY CONDITIONS EACH CLIMBER 
TRAVELLED A FEW FEET BEFORE PASSING 
IT ON PARTS OF EVEREST HAVE BEEN 
CLOSED FOR MONTHS TO MAKE SURE 
THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF ANTI CHINA 
DEMONSTRATORS INTERRUPTING THE 
CLIMB THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE AROUND 
THE WORLD HAVE USED THE RELAY TO 
PROTEST AGAINST THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT ANGRY AT HOW IT RULES 
REGION CALLED TIBET WHEN AN 
OLYMPIC TORCH WAS CARRIED THROUGH 
LONDON LAST MONTH THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE 
ARRESTED THOSE CARRYING THE TORCH 
ON THIS LEG FACE DIFFERENT 
CHALLENGES THEY WAITED FOR DAYS 
FOR THE RIGHT WEATHER CONDITIONS 
AND IT TOOK THEM SEVERAL HOURS GET 
TO THE TOP THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
HOPES THIS TIME THE OLYMPIC FLAME 
HAS MADE THE HEADLINES FOR THE 
RIGHT REASONS 
FINALLY WE ALL HAVE A DREAM WHEN 
I WAS GROWING UP I WAS DESPERATE 
TO PLAY FOR NORWICH CITY PERHAPS 
YOU'RE BIT OF A SINGER THERE'S 
ONE JOB THAT LIZO HAS ALWAYS WANTED 
TO DO TODAY WE SENT HIM OFF TO 
LONDON'S SCIENCE MUSEUM TO SEE IF 
HE'S GOT WHAT IT TAKES 
I TRAVEL TO LOTS OF PLACES BY CAR 
I'VE TRAVELLED BY TRAIN AND I'VE 
EVEN TRAVELLED BY PLANE 
BUT THE ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS 
WANTED TO DO IS GO INTO SPACE AND 
BECOME AN ASTRONAUT APPARENTLY 
THIS IS THE PLACE TO COME AND 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN SPACE 
AGENCY IS LAUNCHING SEARCH FOR A 
NEW GROUP OF ASTRONAUTS 
UNFORTUNATELY YOU'RE ALL TOO YOUNG 
TO APPLY AND THE PEOPLE WHO BE 
SUCCESSFUL HAVE TO HAVE SPECIAL 
QUALITIES IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE 
YOU COULD BE DOING THINGS LIKE THIS 
GOING ON SPACE WALKS CARRYING OUT 
REPAIRS TO SPACE STATIONS AND ALL 
SORTS OF EXCITING TASKS BUT OF 
COURSE THEY WON'T BE PICKET JUST 
ANYONE PICKING ANYONE BECAUSE 
THIS STUFF IS DIFFICULT TO DO EVEN 
FOR TRAINED ASTRONAUTS YOU'VE BEEN 
INTO SPACE WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING 
FOR IF I WANTED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT 
WHAT WILL I NEED TO HAVE DONE A A BACKGROUND IN SCIENCE VAGUELY OR VAGUELY OR AS AN ENGINEER IF YOU'RE A 
SCIENTIST AND AN ENGINEER A PILOT 
THAT WOULD HELP 
O. K. PUTTING THAT 
TO ONE SIDE PHYSICALLY DOU NEED 
TO BE 
INCREDIBLY SPORTY NOT NOT INCREDIBLY SPORTY NOT AN OLYMPIC 
CHAMPION BUT YOU SHOULDN'T SIT IN 
FRONT OF THE COMPUTER ALL DAY LONG 
IF I'M SERIOUS ABOUT GOING INTO 
SPACE THE HARD WORK HAD BETTER 
START NOW L. WONDER IF THEY'VE GOT 
ONE OF THESE IN SMALLER SIZE 
THAT'S ALL FROM US MORE ON THE
