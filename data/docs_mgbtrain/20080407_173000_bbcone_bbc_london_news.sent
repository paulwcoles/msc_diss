FOUR YEARS TIME OUR OLYMPIC 
CORRESPONDENT IS AT TRAFALGAR 
SQUARE FOR US NOW THE SCENE OF 
SOME OF YESTERDAY'S TROUBLE 
I HAVE LEARNED TONIGHT THAT LONDON 
LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY 
NOT STAGE AN INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL 
RELAY LIKE THE CHINESE ARE DOING AT 
THE MOMENT L. HAVE SPOKEN TO 
INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC FIGURES KEY 
FIGURES AND THEY HAVE TOLD ME THERE 
IS SUPPORT FOR A RETURN TO THE OLD 
SYSTEM A NATIONAL RELAY THAT 
MEANS THE TORCH TORCH GOING AROUND 
BRITAIN BUT NOT AROUND THE WORLD 
NO MORE WORLD TOURS FOR THIS FAMOUS 
FLAME WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THERE 
IS SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT IN THE 
OLYMPIC MOVEMENT FOR THE LONDON 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TORCH RELAY TO BE LARGELY A 
NATIONAL AFFAIR SCENES LIKE THIS 
IN THE CAPITAL YESTERDAY FOR THE 
BEIJING RELAY HAVE PUT AN ENTO THE 
GLOBAL TOUR 
THE IDEA OF TAKING THE FLAME AROUND 
THE WORLD WAS INTRODUCESED FOR THE 
TOUR ATHENS GAMES 
FREE TIBET 
BUT THE NOISY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RELAY HAS BECOME 
LESS ABOUT THE OLYMPICS AND MORE 
ABOUT CHINA AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC OFFICIALS HAVE ALREADY 
DISCUSSED A RETURN TO A NATIONAL 
RELAY AND THAT LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ARE ALSO 
BELIEVED TO BE IN FAVOUR OF IT 
THAT MEANS USING THE TORCH TO 
GALVANISE SUPPORT ACROSS BRITAIN 
ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH WHERE 
PEOPLE ARE MORE SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE 
BENEFITS OF THE GAMES BUT WILL 
THIS CONTROVERSY OVER BEIJING HAVE 
AN IMPACT ON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
PEOPLE ARE NOT 
AGAINST THE OLYMPICS THEY ARE 
ISSUES THAT ARE RELEVANT IN 
THE HOST COUNTRY AND MAYBE IN FOUR 
YEARS TIME THERE WILL BE ISSUE THAT 
PEOPLE WILL RAISE ABOUT LONDON I 
DON'T THINK SO 
IT WANT A GOOD WEEKEND FOR THE 
CAPITAL 
THIS WAS NOT A GOOD CAPITAL ADVERTISEMENT FOR LONDON 
PEACEFUL PROTEST IS ONE THING POOR 
OLD KONNIE HUQ HAVING THE FLAME 
WRESTLED FROM HER GRASP IS NOT A 
GOOD ADVERT FOR LONDON 
THERE WILL BE DEMONSTRATIONS AND 
THERE WILL BE GREAT DEAL OF 
STRONG PUBLIC FEELING BUT YOU HAVE 
GOT TO ASK YOURSELF SHOULD WE GO 
TO BEIJING SHOULD OUR ATHLETES GO 
THERE OR SHOULD THEY NOT L. 
THINK THINK THEY SHOULD 
WE HAD TO HAVE THE TORCH RELAY IT 
WAS SAD IT WAS PIS RABLE WEATHER 
MISERABLE WEATHER IT WAS THE 
PROTESTERS AND IT GAVE THE WRONG 
IMAGE IMAGE THAT'S WHAT OLYMPIC ORGANISERS WANT 
TO AVOID IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED 
YESTERDAY YESTERDAY THE FIRST SCUFFLE STARTED AT 
WEMBLEY WHEN PROTESTOR TRIED TO 
SNATCH THE TORCH LATER AT HOLLAND 
PARK KONNIE HUQ WAS CAUGHT IN A 
SCUFFLE SCUFFLE 
THERE WERE EIGHT DISRUPTIONS ON 
SOME PARTS IT WAS DECIDED TO KEEP 
THE TORCH ON BOARD BUS 
SARAH HARRIS LOOKS AT THE WINNERS 
AND LOSERS OF YESTERDAY'S ACTION 
FOR MUM SUE IT WAS TO BE ONE THE 
PROUDEST MOMENTS OF HER LIFE AFTER 
LOSING HER HUSBAND TO CANCER AND 
BATTLING THE DISEASE HERSELF SHE 
WAS TO WATCH HER HER SIXTEEN YEAR OLD 
SON RUN WITH THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
ALONG FLEET STREET IN MEMORY OF HIS 
FATHER FATHER IT SOON BECAME CLEAR THINGS WERE 
NOT GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN 
HE WAS SITTING ON THE BUS 
DOWNSTAIRS HE DIDN'T LOOK AS 
THOUGH HE WAS MAKING AN ATTEMPT TO 
GET OFF HE HAD BEEN TOLD JUST TO 
SIT THERE 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT IT ALL 
REALLY FED UP REALLY SAD REALLY 
DISAPPOINTED DISAPPOINTED I KNOW ADAM WILL BE AS WELL 
FROM THE PROTESTERS POINT OF VIEW 
THE EVENTS COULD BE CALLED A 
SUCCESS THE PROCESSION WAS STOPPED 
EVERY FEW HUNDRED METERS AND OF THE 
THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE ARRESTED THE MAJORITY 
HAD BEEN RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGE 
THIS MORNING THIS WOMAN HAS NO 
REGRETS AFTER HER ATTEMPT TO SQUIRT 
OUT THE FLAME 
THE POLICE PUSHED ME AWAY THE FIRST 
TIME AND PUSHED ME BACK AND THE 
RUNNER WENT ON AND I THOUGHT I WILL 
GO AND HAVE ANOTHER SHOT L. RAN ON 
DOWN BESIDE THE RUNNER AND TURNED 
AND HAD ANOTHER GOOD SHOT AT IT AND 
THE SECOND TIME THEY PUSHED ME 
BACK AND ARRESTED ME 
IT HAD BEEN DESIGNED AS A JOURNEY 
OF HARMONY AND PEACE BUT ENDED UP 
AS THIRTY ONE MILES OF CHAOS AND DISRUPTION 
AS THE PICTURES WERE BEAMED AROUND 
THE WORLD DID LONDONERS THINK IT 
WAS MUCH OF AN ADVERT FOR THEIR 
CITY THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HOSTS 
WE ARE GOING TO BE SHOWN ALL OVER 
THE WORLD I SUPPOSE IT WOULD PUT A 
BAD LIGHT ON LONDON 
IT IS LESS IMPORTANT TO WORRY ABOUT 
HOW LONDON LOOKS TO THE WORLD WHEN 
PEOPLE CAN MAKE THEIR OWN OPINION 
ABOUT LONDON IF THEY VISIT LONDON 
ADAM MADE THE RUN BUT HIS MOTHER 
DID NOT GET TO WITNESS THE SPECIAL 
MOMENT MOMENT ALONG WITH DOZENS OF OTHER PEOPLE 
THE DISRUPTION HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON 
WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A SHINING 
MOMENT IN THEIR FAMILY AND LONDON'S 
HISTORY 
LET'S GO BACK TO OUR OLYMPIC 
CORRESPONDENT CORRESPONDENT WHAT LESSONS HAVE THE OLYMPIC 
MOVEMENT LEARNED ABOUT THE EVENTS 
OF THIS WEEKEND 
OLYMPIC OFFICIALS 
SAID THREE WORDS BACK TO BASICS 
YOU REMEMBER THE GREAT ATMOSPHERE 
THERE WAS AT TRAFALGAR SQUARE WHEN 
LONDON WON IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THEY HAVE GOT 
TO TAKE THAT ATMOSPHERE AROUND THE 
COUNTRY FROM THE HIGHLANDS TO THE 
CHANNEL ISLANDS AND GET EVERYBODY 
FIRED UP BEFORE THE OPENING 
CEREMONY CEREMONY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
SO TELL US WHAT YOU THINK NOW HAS 
THE TORCH RELAY BEEN DAMAGING TO 
LONDON HAS IT CHANGED YOUR VIEW 
YOUR THOUGHTS TO THE USUAL ADDRESS 
AT 
NOW THERE IS LOTS MORE TO COME 
INCLUDING INCLUDING MY QUESTION FOR BORIS WOULD BE 
LONDON IS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR CITY BUT THE 
TUBE CLOSES AT MIDNIGHT WHAT ARE 
YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT 
HOW YOU 
CAN QUESTION THE MAIN MAYORAL 
CANDIDATES IN THE FIRST T. V. ELECTION 
HUSTINGS 
ONE OF THE MEN ACCUSED OF PLOTTING 
TO BLOW UP TRANSATLANTIC AIRLINERS 
IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN A SHADOWY 
FIGURE WHO ARRIVED IN BRITAINEN A 
FALSE BRITAIN ON A FALSE 
PASSPORTMENT EIGHT MEN ARE ACCUSED 
OF CONSPIRING MURDER AND TO 
ENDANGER AN AIRCRAFT 
WHAT MORE DETAILS CAN YOU GIVE US 
WELL SO FAR WE HAVE HAD DETAILS 
ABOUT SEVEN OF THE DEFENDANTS 
TODAY WE HEARD ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD 
MOHAMMED GULZER DESCRIBED BY THE 
PROSECUTION AS A SHADOWY FIGURE 
MORE THAN A FOOT SOLDIER IN THIS 
OPERATION THE PROSECUTION CLAIMED 
THAT MOHAMMED GULZER CAME IN JULY 
TWO THOUSAND SIX TO THE UNITED KINGDOM MASS 
CAR CAR RAIDING AS A HONEYMOONER 
COMING IN FROM SOUTH AFRICA SOUTH 
AFRICA ON FAL SOUTH AFRICAN 
PASSPORT HE WENT TO A SPARTAN 
EXISTENCE IN A FLAT IN BARKING 
WHEN POLICE RAIDED THE FLAT THEY 
FOUND A MOBILE PHONE CONTAINING 
JUST TWO PHONE NUMBERS ONE USE 
TODAY CALL PAKISTAN AND THE OTHER A 
SLIGHTLY TAMPERED WITH NUMBER TO 
CO DEFENDANT ALONGSIDE THE PHONE 
THEY FOUND AN M. P. THREE PLAYER WHICH 
CONTAINED MATERIAL SUCH AS SONGS 
WITH TITLES LIKE I AM A TERRORIST 
AND BLOW THEM UP AND BLOW THEM UP 
THE PROSECUTION SAYS THIS MATERIAL 
WAS CONSISTENT WITH A RADICAL 
ISLAMIST PURSUING A VIOLENT AGENDA 
AFTER THE DISRUPTION AT TERMINAL FIVE 
WHICH LEFT FLIGHTS CANCELLED AND 
BAGS STRANDED PILOTS HAVE 
CRITICISED THE MANAGEMENT OF 
BRITISH AIRWAYS ACCUSING THEM OF 
MAKING THE BRAND A LAUGHING STOCK 
THE PILOTS UNION BALPA MADE THE 
COMMENTS IN A LETTER TO THE CITY 
AND THE GOVERNMENT 
A SOLICITOR WHO STOLE OVER ONE 
MILLION FROM A PERSONAL INJURY 
CLIENT HAS BEEN JAILED FOR TEN 
YEARS KEITH ANDERSON FROM CROYDON 
WAS AWARDED COMPENSATION AFTER 
BEING PARALYSE INDEED A CAR CRASH 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THOMAS MCGOLDRICK WHO 
PRACTISE INDEED CHESHIRE WAS 
CONVICTED OF FIFTY THREE CHARGES INCLUDING 
FALSE ACCOUNTING AND MONEY 
LAUNDERING LAUNDERING ANYONE HAD THE HEART TO DO THAT TO 
SOMEBODY I DON'T KNOW I DON'T 
EVEN KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE HIM BUT 
I'M GLAD I HAVE SEEN JUSTICE DONE 
CANNABIS SWEETS HAVE BEEN SOLD TO 
CHILDREN OVER THE COUNTER AT A SHOP 
IN SOUTH WEST LONDON 
NO LAW HAS BEEN BROKEN AS THE HEMP 
BASED SWEET DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY OF 
THE IND GREETANTS INGREDIENTS 
FOUND IN THE DRUG IT CAUSED 
OUTRAGE AMONG LOCAL PARENTS 
PARAIC O'BRIEN REPORTS 
BARNES THIS SHOP IS KNOWN FOR 
CONFECTIONERY CONFECTIONERY CANNABIS IS A HEMP BASED PASTEL 
MADE IN SWITZERLAND THERE IS NO 
ACTIVE INGREDIENT SO IT IS ACTIVE 
TO MAKE AND SELL 
ONE MOTHER THINKS IT SHOULDN'T BE 
AT LEAST NOT ON THE SWEET COUNTER 
MY PROBLEM WITH IT IT IS TRADING 
ON A NAME WHICH IS THE NAME OF A 
SOFT DRUG ONE OF THE MANY NAMES OF 
SOFT DRUGS DIFFERENT NAMES ON THE 
STREETS AND IT DESENSITISES 
CHILDREN TO THE FACT THAT IT IS 
SOMETHING THEY NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS 
OF OF CARMEL IS PERSUASIVE SOON OTHER 
MUMS ARE TRYING SOME CANNABIS 
IT IS DESIGNED TO MAKE THEM THINK 
THAT CANNABIS IS COOL YES 
IT IS LIKE A MEDICINE TASTE LIKE 
OLD FASHIONED COUGH MIXTURE PMENT I I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE LEGALITIES 
BUT MORALLY IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA 
THE SWEET IS MADE BY A COMPANY 
CALLED SWISS MINTS AND THEY TOLD US 
THAT CANNABIS IS THE LATIN NAME FOR 
THE HEMP FLOWER AND POINTED OUT 
THERE IS PERFUME CALLED OPIUM 
WHICH IS LEGAL TO SELL 
ON BARNES GREEN IT WASN'T BEFORE 
ONE OF THE MOTHERS WAS CHOSEN AS 
THE SPOKESPERSON AND WAS SENT INTO 
THE SHOP 
YOU HAVE THESE SWEETS AND DO YOU 
THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT YOU 
HAVE THEM BEING SOLD TO CHILDREN 
NOT REALLY 
AN ERROR OF JUDGEMENT 
HAS BEEN MADE IT DOESN'T GO WITH 
KIDS AND SWEETS I HAVE INSTRUCTED 
THE MANAGEMENT TO TAKE IT OFF THE 
SHELF AND DELETE THE PRODUCT FROM 
THE SHELF 
RICHMOND TRADING STANDARDS TOLD US 
THEY ARE WITH THE MUMS ON THIS ONE 
AND DON'T CONDONE THE USE OF THE 
WORD CANNABIS IN CONNECTION WITH 
SWEETS 
STILL TO COME 
AN AWARD WINNING FILM MADE IN 
DESERTED LONDON HOW DID THEY MAKE 
THE STREETS APPEAR SO EMPTY 
KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS SAID HE WON'T 
RULE OUT A FOURTH TERM IF RELEGHTED 
NEXT MONTH DESH RE ELECTED NEXT 
MONTH HE SAID HE ONLY PLAN TO 
STAND FOR TWO TERMS BUT TOLD THE 
B. B. C. HE WOULDN'T DISCOUNT STANDING 
AGAIN AGAIN BRIAN PADDICK HAS SAID HIS YEARS 
WITH THE POLICE FORCE MORE THAN 
QUALIFIES HIM FOR THE JOB OF MAYOR 
MR. MR BRIAN PADDICK UNVEILED HIS 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT MANIFESTO THIS 
MORNING HE PROMISED BETTER 
TRANSPORT MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
AND SAFER NEIGHBOURHOODS HE SAID 
HE WOULD LISTEN TO LONDONERS 
CONCERNS CONCERNS ON PAST PERFORMANCE DO THEY REALLY 
TRUST THE CURRENT MAYOR TO RUN 
LONDON IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL 
LONDONERS LONDONERS ON PAST PERFORMANCE DO THEY REALLY 
TRUST THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE TO 
RUN ANYTHING AT ALL 
THERE ARE JUST OVER THREE WEEKS 
UNTIL LONDONERS GO TO THE POLLS AND 
THE CANDIDATES FIND OUT HOW 
EFFECTIVE THEIR CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN 
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN WE ARE TAKING 
A DETAILED LOOK AT THE MAJOR ISSUES 
FOR THE FIRST IN OUR SERIES 
VICTORIA HOLLINS HAS BEEN TO THE 
CITY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S AN THE 
WISH LIST FOR THE BUSINESSES 
LONDON THE WORLD'S LEADING 
FINANCIAL CITY CONTRIBUTING TWO HUNDRED 
BILLION TO THE ECONOMY EVERY YEAR 
AND PROVIDING FORTY SIX MILLION JOBS THE 
MAYOR DOESN'T HAVE POWER OVER 
BUSINESS BUT HE IS CHARGED WITH 
CREATING THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT TO 
BRING IT HERE 
HE DOES HAVE POWER OVER TRANSPORT 
AND CAN MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE 
TO GET TO WORK AND DO BUSINESS HERE 
THE MAYOR ALSO HAS POWERS OVER 
PLANNING SO WHETHER IT IS PUTTING 
UP MORE TALL BLTIONZ OR BUILDING 
BUILDINGS OR BUILDING MORE 
AFFORDABLE HOMES SO PEOPLE CAN 
AFFORD TO LIVE AND WORK IN THE 
CAPITAL CAPITAL HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SKILLS AND 
TRAINING MAKING SURE THE CAPITAL 
HAS A WELL QUALIFIED WORKFORCE 
SO TAKE TWO BUSINESSES BIG AND 
SMALL WHAT DO THEY WANT FROM THE 
MAYOR MAYOR SUE EMPLOYS NINE STAFF IN SMALL 
BUSINESS SHE HAS RUN FOR TWENTY YEARS 
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO REPORT 
BUSINESS CRIME THE SECOND THING IS 
ABOUT THE CONGESTION CHARGE AND 
TRANSPORT WHY CAN'T SMALL 
BUSINESSES WITH ESSENTIAL BUSINESS 
CARS BE TREATED THE SAME AS 
RESIDENTS AND PAY THE LOWER RATE 
THAT WOULD HELP SMALL BUSINESSES IN 
LONDON AND THE THIRD THING IS 
REALLY REALLY REALLY VITAL AND 
THAT'S ACCORD ACCORDABLE BUSINESS 
ACCOMMODATION ACCOMMODATION THE THINGS FOR THE MAYOR TO WORK ON 
THE TRANSPORT AGENDA DELIVER 
CROSSRAIL DON'T LET UP ON THE 
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TUBE ON SKILLS 
WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNEMPLOYED IN 
LONDON WE MUST GET GET THEM AUTO 
INTO WORK AND WE HAVE GOT TO GET A 
LEGACY FROM THE GAMES FOR LONDON 
KEN LIVINGSTONE SAYS HE WILL 
CONTINUE TO USE OFFICES IN SHORTAGE 
HIGH AND VENEZUELA TO SHANGHAI 
AND VENEZUELA TO ATTRACT BUSINESS 
IN LONDON 
KEN SAYS CROSSRAIL WILL COME IN ON 
BUDGET AND BRING THIRTY THOUSAND NEW JOBS 
AND CONGESTION IS BRIAN PADDICK'S 
BATTLEGROUND BATTLEGROUND BUT BUSINESSES STILL NEED SOME 
CONVINCING 
I THINK A STRONG MAYOR CONVINCING IS A VITAL FIGURE FOR THE CAP 
CAPITAL WE WERE GETTING NO 
MOVEMENT ON ANYTHING BEFORE TWO THOUSAND 
WE HAVE SEEN THE OLYMPICS AND THE 
CROSSRAIL CROSSRAIL ECONOMIC STORM CLOUDS ARE GATHERING 
OVER THE CAPITAL BUSINESSES WILL 
LOOK TO THE MAYOR TO KEEP LONDON
