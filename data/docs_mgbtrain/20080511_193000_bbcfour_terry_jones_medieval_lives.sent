ONCE UPON A TIME FAR FROM THE TURMOIL OF THE BUSY WORLD THERE LIVED A MONK 
HE DEDICATED HIMSELF TO A LIFE OF PRAYER 
OF HARD WORK 
POVERTY 
AND SILENCE 
LOVELY DAY SSH 
HIS LIFE WAS SHUT AWAY FROM THE TEMPTATIONS OF ORDINARY MORTALS 
HE DEDICATED HIMSELF TO GOD IN A LIFE THAT WAS LITERALLY OUT OF THIS WORLD 
BUT IF MONKS IN THE MIDDLE AGES REALLY WERE LIKE THIS 
AT BURY SAINT EDMUNDS ABBEY IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN 
THE LAST THING ON THE MONKS' MINDS WAS THE CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE 
FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR 
THE MONASTERY AND THE TOWNSFOLK HAD BEEN LOCKED IN PITCHED BATTLES 
WHICH CULMINATED IN THE ABBOT BEING KIDNAPPED BUNDLED INTO A SACK 
AND CARTED OFF TO LONDON WHERE HIS EYEBROWS WERE SHAVED OFF 
AND BURY SAINT EDMUNDS WAS NOT UNIQUE 
IT WAS AN AGE WHEN ABBOTS HAD THEIR OWN ARMIES 
BISHOPS RAN BROTHELS 
AND ARCHBISHOPS OFTEN RAN THE COUNTRY MAYBE EVEN A MONK'S LIFE 
WASN'T QUITE AS WE IMAGINE EITHER 
THE IDEA OF LIVING A LIFE CUT OFF FROM YOUR FELLOW MEN 
IN ORDER TO WORSHIP GOD 
DIDN'T REALLY GET GOING IN THE WEST UNTIL AROUND 
WHEN AN ITALIAN NAMED BENEDICT DECIDED TO ESCAPE CITY LIFE 
AND HIDE HIMSELF AWAY IN THESE MOUNTAINS 
BENEDICT HADN'T LIKED ROME 
FOR HIS TASTE THERE WAS FAR TOO MUCH EATING DRINKING AND SEX AND GENERALLY HAVING A GOOD TIME 
HE WAS LOOKING FOR A NICE CAVE WITH NO FITTED CARPETS OR PLUMBING 
HALLE LUJAH 
SO HE MOVED IN HERE 
HE PREFERRED HIS FOOD TO BE LOWERED TO HIM IN A BUCKET ONLY ONCE A DAY 
AND HE DIDN'T WANT ANY OYSTER SAUCE OR DEEP FRIED WONTONS 
NOTHING IN FACT HE COULD ENJOY 
AS FAR AS BENEDICT WAS CONCERNED 
GOD PLACED US ON THIS WORLD TO REFRAIN FROM ENJOYING OUR TIME HERE 
AND CONCENTRATE ON THANKING HIM FOR PLACING US HERE 
IT'S A CURIOUS PHILOSOPHY BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A LOT OF APPEAL 
BENEDICT JUST COULDN'T KEEP A GOOD THING LIKE THIS TO HIMSELF 
AND SOON THERE WERE LOTS OF OTHER WOULD BE HERMITS JOINING HIM 
SO THEY COULD NOT ENJOY THEMSELVES IN SOLITUDE TOGETHER IN THE COMPANY OF THE GREAT MAN 
IF THERE'S ONE THING HERMITS LIKE BENEDICT CAN'T STAND 
IT'S OVERCROWDING 
WITHIN A FEW YEARS HE HAD SO MANY FOLLOWERS SHARING HIS SOLITUDE 
HE ORGANISED THEM INTO SEPARATE COMMUNITIES MONASTERIES AND HE WROTE A BOOK OF RULES FOR MONKS 
ACCORDING TO BENEDICT HIS RULES WEREN'T THAT STRICT 
BUT HE WOULDN'T LET HIS MONKS EAT RED MEAT 
NOR SHOULD THEY TALK AT MEAL TIMES 
HOWEVER BENEDICT DID ALLOW HIS MONKS TO MAKE A SIGN IF THEY WANTED SOMETHING LIKE SALT 
AND WE KNOW WHAT THESE SIGNS WERE BECAUSE THE MONKS COMPILED DICTIONARIES OF THIS SIGN LANGUAGE 
FOR EXAMPLE THE SIGN FOR KING WAS THIS 
AND GOD WAS KING IN HEAVEN 
WHILE THE SIGN FOR MARTYR YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO LEARN WAS THIS 
AND FISH WAS SIMPLE 
BUT FOR SOME CURIOUS REASON HERRING WAS THIS SIGN 
FOR SOME EVEN MORE CURIOUS REASON 
TROUT WAS THE SIGN FOR HERRING FOLLOWED BY THIS THE SIGN FOR WOMAN 
BUT BENEDICT HADN'T ENVISAGED 
THAT THESE SIMPLE SIGNS WOULD BLOSSOM INTO AN ENTIRE LANGUAGE 
THE SAME SIGNS WERE USED IN MONASTERIES ALL OVER EUROPE 
A SORT OF DUMB ESPERANTO 
SO WHATEVER COUNTRY A MONK FOUND HIMSELF IN HE COULD ALWAYS CONVEY TO A FELLOW MONK WHAT HE WANTED 
SAINT BENEDICT'S BOOK OF RULES 
BECAME FAMOUS AND HIS MONASTERIES FLOURISHED 
IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY ONE WAS BUILT ON TOP OF BENEDICT'S ACTUAL CAVE 
THE MONASTERY OF SAN BENEDETTO PERCHES HALFWAY UP THE SHEER ROCK FACE WHERE HE SOUGHT SOLITUDE 
I WAS SHOWN ROUND BY THE UNLIKELY FIGURE OF AN AUSTRALIAN MONK WHO CAME HERE FORTY ONE YEARS AGO 
FATHER GIOVANNI CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THIS PAINTING 
IT'S AN EPISODE OF THE LIFE OF SAINT BENEDICT WHAT'S HE DOING 
IN ONE OF THE MONASTERIES FOUNDED BY THE SAINT IN THIS VALLEY 
THERE WAS A LAZY MONK HE DIDN'T WANT TO STAY IN THE CHAPEL AND PRAY 
THE DEVIL WAS PULLING HIM OUT SEE ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE SAINT BENEDICT 
WHO CURED THIS LAZY MONK WITH A STICK A HIDING HE BEAT HIM 
NOT A POPULAR METHOD TODAY 
THERE'S SAINT BENEDICT DURING A TEMPTATION SEE THE DEVIL 
HE'S BREATHING FIRE 
THERE'S A THIRD DEVIL HERE LET'S SEE THAT'S THE MAIN DEVIL 
BEHIND BARS HE'S MEANT TO BE KEPT IN PRISON YES 
BENEDICT HAS GOT HIM IN JAIL EXACTLY 
HOW WHEN THE MONASTIC MOVEMENT IS REALLY MONKS TAKING THEMSELVES AWAY FROM THE WORLD 
HOW IS IT THEY HAVE HAD ANY EFFECT ON THE WORLD 
SOLITUDE SILENCE THAT'S THE METHOD EH 
THE MAIN WORK OF MONKS IS PRAYER 
ORA ET LABORA 
PRAYER AND WORK 
THE MONKS HAD TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES 
AND SUPPLY THEIR OWN NEEDS SO THEY COULD KEEP AWAY FROM THE WORLD 
BUT KEEPING THEIR DISTANCE FROM THE WORLD 
WAS TO PROVE THE ONE THING THAT MONASTERIES WEREN'T VERY GOOD AT 
THE UNWORLDLINESS OF MONKS JUST WASN'T DESTINED TO LAST 
AND IRONICALLY 
IT BEGAN TO BREAK DOWN BECAUSE OF BELIEF IN THE POWER OF PRAYER 
AND IN THE IDEA THAT THE PURER AND SIMPLER THE LIFE YOU LED 
THE MORE LIKELY GOD WAS TO LISTEN 
AND MONKS WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD THE PUREST LIVES SO THEIR PRAYERS WERE SEEN AS A HOTLINE TO GOD 
RICH FOLK AND WARRIORS BEGAN TO PAY MONKS TO DO ALL THE PRAYING THEY WERE TOO BUSY TO DO FOR THEMSELVES 
PRAYER BECAME A COMMODITY 
IT GAINED A COMMERCIAL VALUE 
AND THAT WAS TO PROVE THE UNDOING OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM 
IT WAS A PRETTY ROUGH WORLD OUTSIDE THE MONASTERY WALLS 
FIGHTING MEN WERE PROFESSIONALLY ENGAGED IN BREAKING COMMANDMENTS 
ESPECIALLY THOU SHALT NOT KILL 
A WARRIOR'S SOUL WAS NOT AN EASY ONE TO SAVE 
IN FACT IT REQUIRED A STRENUOUS EFFORT BY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO PRAY HIS WAY OUT 
AFTER THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS FOR EXAMPLE 
THE CHURCH DEMANDED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF PENANCE FOR EVERYONE KILLED 
WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR IN HIS LIFETIME MUST HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME TEN THOUSAND DEATHS 
THAT'S THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF PENANCE 
HE WOULDN'T HAVE FINISHED YET NOT UNTIL THE YEAR FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
H. M. M. 
HOWEVER IF THE WORK WAS SPLIT UP AMONGST A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MONKS 
WILLIAM COULD HAVE HIS SOUL CLEANSED IN LESS THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS 
SO HE FOUNDED A STRING OF ABBEYS TO PRAY FOR HIS SOUL 
IN FACT ANYONE WHO HAD ANY MONEY WOULD DEEM IT WISE TO INVEST A BIT OF IT IN THE INNOCENCE OF MONKS 
AND FAR FROM LIVING LIVES OF EXTREME POVERTY AND DISCOMFORT 
MONKS BEGAN TO FIND THEMSELVES AS RICH AS CROESUS 
THE MONKS OF THIS ABBEY BENEFITED SO MUCH FROM VARIOUS KINGS THEY OWNED THE COUNTY OF WEST SUFFOLK 
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION AND FURTHER 
THEY BUILT THIS TOWN OF BURY SAINT EDMUNDS 
AND YOU CAN STILL SEE HOW THE ABBOT CAREFULLY PLANNED IT ON A GRID JUST LIKE NEW YORK 
EVERY SINGLE COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION INVOLVED A CUT FOR THE MONKS 
WHETHER YOU RAN A BARGE ON THE RIVER OR A STALL IN THE MARKET 
OR SOLD FISH OR BUILDING MATERIALS 
THE ABBEY ADMINISTERED JUSTICE AND POCKETED EVERY FINE IT TOOK 
IT RAN THE ROYAL MINT 
BEING ABBOT OF BURY SAINT EDMUNDS WAS LITERALLY A LICENCE TO PRINT MONEY 
THE ABBEY EVEN OWNED THE VERY HORSE DROPPINGS ON THE STREET 
AND THE MONKS TOOK THEIR CUT OF IT 
EVERY ABBOT JEALOUSLY GUARDED HIS MONOPOLY 
TAKE ABBOT SAMSON FOR EXAMPLE 
WHO RULED BURY WITH A ROD OF IRON IN THE LATE TWELFTH CENTURY 
ONE DAY HE HEARD THAT HIS DEAN HERBERT HAD BUILT A WINDMILL 
WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION 
THE ABBOT WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE MIFFED HIS BIOGRAPHER TELLS US 
SAMSON BOILED WITH FURY 
AND COULD HARDLY EAT OR SLEEP HE SUMMONED HERBERT AND SAID 
I THANK YOU AS MUCH AS IF YOU HAD CUT OFF BOTH MY FEET 
BY THE FAITH OF GOD I WILL NEVER EAT BREAD UNTIL THAT BUILDING IS DESTROYED 
WELL IT WAS A SUBTLE ENOUGH HINT 
BUT HERBERT TOOK IT AND DESTROYED THE MILL IMMEDIATELY 
B. A. A. A. A. 
AS A RICH LANDOWNER 
THE ABBOT OF BURY WAS SUPPOSED TO MARSHAL A SMALL ARMY FOR THE KING 
ABBOT SAMSON HAD NO PROBLEM THERE 
IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE HE PERSONALLY DONNED ARMOUR AND LED HIS TROOPS IN THE SIEGE OF WINDSOR 
FIGHTING FOR RICHARD I AGAINST HIS BROTHER JOHN 
POOR SAINT BENEDICT AND HIS RULE BOOK MUST HAVE TURNED IN THEIR GRAVES 
THERE WAS THIS PARADOX AT THE HEART OF MEDIEVAL MONASTICISM 
ONE OF THE DRIVING FORCES BEHIND MONASTICISM 
WAS THE IDEA THAT AS MONKS LED PURER SIMPLER MORE AUSTERE LIVES 
THEIR PRAYERS WERE WORTH MORE THAN OTHER FOLKS' 
OF COURSE THE PURER SIMPLER MORE AUSTERE A MONASTERY WAS 
THE MORE IT ATTRACTED WEALTH FROM RICH CLIENTS ANXIOUS FOR IT TO SAY THEIR PRAYERS FOR THEM 
THE IRONY WAS THAT THE WEALTHIER A MONASTERY BECAME 
THE LESS PURE SIMPLE AND AUSTERE ITS LIFESTYLE BECAME 
HENCE LESS VALUABLE ITS PRAYERS IT WAS A VICIOUS CIRCLE 
EXACTLY EXACTLY 
SO A NEW BREED OF MONK WOULD TAKE MONASTICISM BACK TO BASICS 
HERE ON THE NORTH YORKSHIRE MOORS 
A GROUP OF MONKS ARRIVED FROM THE FRENCH ABBEY OF CLAIRVAUX IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
THESE MONKS HAD COME TO GET BACK TO THE BASICS OF SAINT BENEDICT'S RULE 
AND ENJOY LIVES OF ABJECT POVERTY VEGETARIANISM AND DISCIPLINE 
THEY CALLED THEMSELVES CISTERCIANS AND WORE WHITE ROBES TO SYMBOLISE PURITY 
THEY ALSO WORE NO UNDERPANTS TO SYMBOLISE I'M NOT SURE WHAT 
BUT SAINT BENEDICT HADN'T MENTIONED UNDERPANTS SO THE CISTERCIANS WOULD HAVE NO TRUCK WITH THEM 
SOME CALL IT BARE BOTTOMED PIETY 
THE CISTERCIANS WORSHIPPED GOD NOT ONLY WITHOUT UNDERPANTS 
BUT IN THE MOST REMOTE AND UNINHABITED PLACES 
AT THE START JUST TWELVE MONKS AND AN ABBOT LIVED HERE IN WOODEN HUTS 
BUT WITHIN TWENTY YEARS THE WOODEN HUTS WERE A DISTANT MEMORY 
THEY NAMED THE NEW MONASTERY RIEVAULX 
AND MANY MORE WERE SOON TO FOLLOW 
THE CISTERCIANS WERE MORE THAN A RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT 
THEY WERE A BRAND THEY INVENTED A SORT OF MCMONASTICISM 
A WORLDWIDE FRANCHISE IN WHICH UNIFORMITY WAS THE KEY 
THE SAME BOOKS THE SAME FOOD CUSTOMS CLOTHES ARCHITECTURE 
IT'S SAID THAT A BLIND MONK FROM SCOTLAND 
COULD FIND HIS WAY ROUND A SCANDINAVIAN CISTERCIAN MONASTERY 
ARCHAEOLOGIST GLYN COPPACK HAS BEEN EXAMINING CISTERCIAN MONASTERIES ALL OVER BRITAIN 
AT NEIGHBOURING FOUNTAINS ABBEY 
HOW DID THEY GET BACK TO BASICS THEY SIMPLIFIED THEIR ARCHITECTURE 
AND SPENT A LONG TIME PERFECTING IT 
SO YOU HAVE SIMPLE PILLARS WITH POINTED ARCHES AND TO ADD TO THE AUSTERITY 
THE WHOLE THING IS PINK AND WHITE 
YOU CAN STILL SEE WHERE THE WEATHER HASN'T TAKEN IT OFF BUT IT'S VERY FRAGILE IT WOULD HAVE SHONE INSIDE 
IT'S A KIND OF SYMBOLIC PURITY OH ABSOLUTELY AND IN THE WINDOWS 
PLAIN GLASS NO COLOURED GLASS 
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS PLAIN GLASS WE'VE GOT SOME COINCIDENCE 
WE FOUND EARLIER YOU SEE IT'S JUST A PLAIN CAN I TOUCH IT YES 
NO COLOUR IN THERE AND YOU DON'T SEE MANY OF THESE THIS IS A PROCESSIONAL CROSS 
THIS WOULD NORMALLY BE GOLD OR SILVER THIS IS IRON 
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS YOU CAN GET 
WHY ARE THEY DOING IT WHO IS THIS GOING TO APPEAL TO THIS AUSTERITY 
WELL THE SIMPLER THE RELIGION THE MORE POWERFUL THE PRAYERS 
AND THE PEOPLE THEY'RE APPEALING TO ARE THOSE WHO NEED SALVATION MOST 
THE MILITARY PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS 
THE MILL THE BREWERY THE KITCHENS AND THE LATRINES OF THE MONASTERY 
WERE ALL FED BY A SOPHISTICATED WATER SUPPLY 
IN THE CLOISTER WATER COMES OUT IN TAPS LIKE THIS 
A TAP OH IT'S GOT A LITTLE CELTIC BEAST'S HEAD 
THE HOLE'S I SEE SO THAT'S OFF AND TO GET THE WATER TO COME THROUGH YOU JUST TURN IT RIGHT 
THEN WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED YOU TURN IT BACK UP AND IT STOPS BRILLIANT 
SO WHAT DATE IS THIS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
IT'S THE SORT OF THING MANY OF US DIDN'T HAVE TILL NINETEEN TWENTY IN OUR HOMES 
THE CISTERCIANS WEREN'T POOR MONKS WHO ARRIVED IN YORKSHIRE BY CHANCE 
IT WAS ALL RUN TO A CENTRALLY CO ORDINATED BUSINESS PLAN 
AND THEY WERE RUTHLESS WITH ANYONE WHO HAPPENED TO GET IN THE WAY 
ONE CRITIC WROTE 
THEY RAZE VILLAGES AND TURN OUT THE PARISHIONERS WHO ARE REDUCED TO POVERTY 
THE CISTERCIANS WERE NATURAL BUSINESSMEN 
AT FOUNTAINS THEY BRED A SUPER SHEEP WHICH PRODUCED THE HIGHEST QUALITY WOOL IN EUROPE 
AT RIEVAULX THEY MOVED INTO HEAVY INDUSTRY 
ANOTHER ARCHAEOLOGIST GERRY MCDONNELL IS TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW ADVANCED THEIR TECHNOLOGY WAS 
WHAT WE'VE BUILT HERE IS A FURNACE 
BASED ON ONE THAT WE EXCAVATED FURTHER TO THE NORTH AT BILSDALE 
IT'S AN EARLY BLOOMERY FURNACE 
THE DOMINANT METHOD OF PRODUCING IRON IN THE TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES 
WHAT WERE THEY DOING WITH IT THEY NEED THEIR OWN SUPPLY JUST TO BUILD THE ABBEY ITSELF YOU NEED TOOLS 
THE CHISELS SAWS ETC BUT ALSO FOR EXAMPLE TO SHEAR THE SHEEP YOU NEED SHEARS STEEL EDGED TOOLS 
BUT THE QUANTITY THEY'RE PRODUCING WAS FAR IN EXCESS OF THEIR NEEDS 
SO THEY WERE ACTUALLY SELLING IT ON INTO THE OPEN MARKET 
THE ADVANTAGE OF THE CISTERCIANS IS THEY HAVE A GOOD EUROPEAN NETWORK 
AND SO THE ABILITY FOR TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFER WITHIN THAT GROUP IS GOOD 
THEY WERE COMPETENT ENGINEERS AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGY 
AS THE CISTERCIAN MONASTERIES GREW WEALTHIER 
SO THEIR ARCHITECTURE GOT MORE ELABORATE AND DECORATED 
BY THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY THESE ARCHES WERE PICKED OUT WITH RED PAINT 
AND BY THE FIFTEENTH THEY WERE EVEN THROWING IN THE ODD SCULPTURE 
HEAVENS ABOVE 
AND OF COURSE NO WELL TO DO MONK WANTS TO SHARE A DORMITORY 
SO THEY ALL MOVED OUT AND ESTABLISHED INDIVIDUAL BACHELOR PADS EACH WITH ITS OWN FIREPLACE 
YOU CAN SEE IT CUT INTO THIS WALL 
AND A BEDROOM UPSTAIRS COMPLETE WITH AN ENSUITE LAVATORY 
AND REMEMBER SAINT BENEDICT'S DIET 
HIS MONKS WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO EAT THE FLESH OF FOUR FOOTED CREATURES 
MONKS HOWEVER COULD EAT MEAT IF THEY WERE ILL 
SO MEAT WAS AVAILABLE 
HERE IN THE INFIRMARY SO LITTLE BY LITTLE 
THE BROTHERS GAVE UP EATING IN THE REFECTORY AND STARTED TO TAKE THEIR MEALS HERE INSTEAD 
CISTERCIAN LOGIC FOR YOU 
IT WAS ANOTHER LOOPHOLE JUST LIKE THE ONE THAT ALLOWED MONKS TO GET AROUND THE NO TALKING AT MEALS RULE 
BY USING SIGN LANGUAGE 
IN FACT MOST OF THE SIGNS WERE ABOUT FOOD 
WHICH ISN'T SURPRISING BECAUSE IN A MONASTERY THERE WAS A LOT OF FOOD TO TALK ABOUT 
HERE IN GLASTONBURY FOR EXAMPLE THE ABBOT'S KITCHEN WAS ONE VAST CHIMNEY 
EVERY WEEK CONTAINED AT LEAST ONE FEAST DAY 
IN WHICH THE POOR MONKS MIGHT HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING LIKE SIXTEEN COURSES 
THE MONKS WERE EQUALLY SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR BOOZE 
ALCOHOL ACCOUNTED FOR SOME TWENTY PER CENT OF THEIR ENERGY INTAKE NOW IT'S FIVE PER CENT 
WELL MAYBE A BIT MORE IN MY CASE 
REMEMBER IT WASN'T SAFE TO DRINK THE TAP WATER 
STILL IT'S A LONG WAY FROM BENEDICT'S BUCKET 
GLUTTONY WAS NOT THE ONLY SIN THAT MONKS FELL PREY TO 
RECORDS FOR ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN NOTE A BROTHEL IN WESTMINSTER THE MAIDEN'S HEAD 
THAT WAS MUCH FREQUENTED BY MONKS 
AND WITH TWELVE POCKET MONEY A YEAR 
ANY GIRL WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE A MONK AT THE DOOR 
AS TIME WENT ON THE MONASTERIES WERE JUST COINING IN MONEY 
AFTER ALL THEY HELD THE KEYS TO HEAVEN WHERE EVERYONE WANTS TO GO 
SO THERE WERE PLENTY OF WAYS TO PART BELIEVERS FROM THEIR CASH 
FOR EXAMPLE THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH ADVISED PEOPLE TO GO ON PILGRIMAGE AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIVES 
IT WAS GOOD FOR THE SOUL AND IT MADE THE CHURCH A LOT OF MONEY 
MONASTIC INSTITUTIONS UP AND DOWN THE LAND VIED WITH EACH OTHER 
TO ATTRACT THE MOST VISITORS 
THE BEST BET WAS TO HAVE A REALLY FIRST CLASS RELIC 
CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL MADE OVER ONE THOUSAND A YEAR OUT OF PILGRIMAGE 
OF COURSE THE BIG ATTRACTION THERE WAS THE SKULL OF THOMAS A BECKET 
A TURBULENT PRIEST WHO CHALLENGED THE POWER OF KING HENRY THE SECOND 
YOU COULD SEE WHERE HIS HEAD HAD BEEN SPLIT IN TWO 
MONKS OF CANTERBURY HAD PLENTY OF OTHER RELICS TO BE PROUD OF 
THERE WAS AARON'S ROD 
THERE WAS SOME OF THE STONE ON WHICH THE LORD WAS STANDING SHORTLY BEFORE HE ASCENDED TO HEAVEN 
THERE WAS PART OF THE TABLE 
OFF WHICH THE LAST SUPPER WAS EATEN 
THEY EVEN HAD SOME OF THE CLAY 
OUT OF WHICH GOD FASHIONED ADAM 
AND SOME OF THE VIRGIN MARY'S KNITTING 
AND WE KNOW ALL THIS BECAUSE A WRITER IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY CAREFULLY NOTED IT ALL DOWN 
THE MONASTERIES AND THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH ITSELF 
HAD BECOME BY THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY ONE VAST COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE 
AND THE CORPORATE H. Q. WAS HERE IN AVIGNON 
THIS WAS THE SEAT OF THE POPES FROM ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINE TO ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN 
IT WAS TO HERE THAT THE VAST WEALTH OF CHRISTENDOM FLOWED 
IN AND ENDLESS STREAM OF TITHES FINES BRIBES AND BACKHANDERS 
THE POPE MUST HAVE PRESIDED OVER 
THE GREATEST ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH IN THE WESTERN WORLD 
HE ALSO HAD A LOT OF ENEMIES 
I'M PRETTY CERTAIN HE DIDN'T SLEEP EASILY IN HIS BED AT NIGHT 
YOU CAN TELL THAT FROM HIS PALACE 
IT'S MORE LIKE A FORTRESS THAN A PALACE A PALACE OF PARANOIA 
WITH A DARK SECRET AT ITS CENTRE 
THIS IS WHERE THE POPE WOULD HOLD GREAT BANQUETS 
THE CARVER WOULD CUT UP EVERYBODY'S MEAT FOR THEM BEHIND BIG SCREENS 
JUST ABOUT HERE WHICH YOU'D THINK VERY KIND OF HIM 
BUT IN FACT NOBODY WAS ALLOWED IN THE POPE'S PRESENCE WITH A KNIFE 
SO CUTTING UP THEIR MEAT WASN'T A CONVENIENCE BUT A SECURITY PRECAUTION 
RATHER LIKE HAVING PLASTIC CUTLERY ON AIRLINES NOWADAYS 
THIS IS WHERE THE POPE WOULD MAKE HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES 
NOW IN ROME HE'D APPEAR ON THE BALCONY OF SAINT PETER'S AND WAVE TO THE ASSEMBLED MASSES BELOW 
IN AVIGNON HE'D STICK HIS HEAD OUT HERE HE'S COVERED TO HIS LEFT 
AND IF HE SPOTS ANY TROUBLE IN THE CROWD HE CAN DUCK OUT OF THE WAY 
THIS IS THE GRAND TREASURY 
WHERE THE POPE'S ACCOUNTANTS WERE KEPT BUSY CHECKING ALL THE MONEY 
THAT POURED INTO THE PAPAL COFFERS 
AND NOW WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO THE GREAT SECRET AT THE HEART OF THE PAPAL PALACE OF AVIGNON 
I'M GOING INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES 
THE LOWER TREASURY WHERE THE POPE STORED ALL THAT PRODIGIOUS WEALTH 
THIS IS WHERE THE TITHES AND OFFERINGS FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER EUROPE ENDED UP 
DEEP IN THE BOWELS OF THIS CLOSELY GUARDED FORTRESS 
BUT EVEN THIS ISN'T THE GREAT SECRET 
THE GREAT SECRET IS WHERE THEY KEPT THE REAL TREASURE 
THIS WHOLE ROOM HAS A FALSE FLOOR 
THIS IS THE GRUBBY SECRET AT THE HEART OF CHRISTENDOM IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
IT WAS HERE UNDER HIS FLOORBOARDS THAT GOD'S REPRESENTATIVE ON EARTH STASHED THE REAL TREASURE 
GOLD PLATE COINS AND JEWELLERY 
IT'S ODD TO THINK THAT IF YOU OR I WERE LOOKING AT THIS SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T LEAVE THIS ROOM ALIVE 
WEALTH AND POWER 
ARE INEVITABLE BEDFELLOWS 
AND IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE POPES BECAME RULERS GREAT PRINCES 
VYING WITH KINGS FOR TERRITORY AND INFLUENCE 
THE POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE DIDN'T PASS BY THE MONASTERY WALLS UNNOTICED 
IT CAUGHT UP THE ABBOTS PRIORS AND MONKS AND CARRIED THEM WITH IT 
AS THE POWER AND WEALTH OF THE CHURCH AND ITS MONASTERIES GREW 
RESENTMENT AMONGST THE LAITY ALSO GATHERED MOMENTUM 
IN BURY SAINT EDMUNDS IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN A GROUP OF TOWNSFOLK ASSEMBLED HERE 
IN THE GUILD HALL 
AND SWORE AN OATH TO DESTROY THE POWER OF THE ABBEY 
THE NEXT DAY ALMOST THE ENTIRE ADULT POPULATION TURNED OUT FULLY ARMED IN THE MARKETPLACE HERE 
THEY ATTACKED THE ABBEY 
THEY BEAT UP THE MONKS STOLE THEIR HABITS AND WENT RUNNING ROUND THE TOWN IN THEM 
THE CONFLICT WOULD LAST A YEAR AND EVEN PRIESTS AND FRIARS LED ARMED ASSAULTS AGAINST THE MONASTERY 
DURING THE RIOTS THE GATEHOUSE TO THE ABBEY HAD BEEN DESTROYED 
SO THE MONKS BUILT A FORTIFIED ONE WITH PORTCULLIS AND ARROW SLITS 
BUT IT DIDN'T DO THEM MUCH GOOD IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THERE WAS A NATIONAL UPRISING 
AND BURY ALONG WITH OTHER MONASTERIES WAS SACKED AND LOOTED 
THE PRIOR WAS EXECUTED AND HIS SEVERED HEAD WAS STUCK ON A PIKE 
EVEN THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY WAS BEHEADED BY THE MOB 
THE CHURCH'S RESPONSE WAS TO ADOPT A PROGRAMME OF ZERO TOLERANCE 
FROM ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED ONE ANYONE WHO DARED TO CRITICISE THE CHURCH 
FACED THE PROSPECT OF BEING BURNT AT THE STAKE 
THE STORY OF THE MONASTERIES ENDED 
WHEN HENRY THE EIGHTH MADE HIMSELF HEAD OF THE CHURCH IN ENGLAND AND DESTROYED THEM 
CONFISCATING THEIR WEALTH 
ALL WE HAVE NOW ARE THESE FAIRY RUINS 
A MONUMENT TO AN IDEAL OF SIMPLICITY AND PIETY THAT BECAME CORRUPTED ON A MAGNIFICENT SCALE 
IT SEEMS TO ME 
LOOKING BACK THROUGH THE MONKS' STORY THAT ONCE PRAYER ACQUIRED A MONETARY VALUE THE GAME WAS UP 
THE MONASTERIES THE PRAYER FACTORIES BECAME COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES 
AND ONCE THAT HAD HAPPENED THERE WAS JUST NO WAY THEY COULD FULFIL THEIR ORIGINAL FUNCTION 
THE MONKS COULDN'T REALLY CUT THEMSELVES OFF FOR EVER 
FROM THE WICKED WORLD 
NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRIED THEY WERE PART OF THE WICKED WORLD 
AND WHAT'S MORE VERY OFTEN THEY RAN IT 
NEXT TIME ON TERRY JONES' MEDIEVAL LIVES THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS 
I MEET REAL MEDIEVAL WOMEN WHO FIGHT IN WARS RUN BUSINESSES AND EVEN RUN THE COUNTRY 
HALF COMMUNE HALF ROCK BAND 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD CHANGE THE WORLD 
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GROUP 
WE LIVE TOGETHER BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THESE TWO SEVERLY AUTISTIC CHILDREN 
HAD PIONEERING THERAPY TO HELP THEM SPEAK 
WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT APPLE 
THIS POLITICIAN WASN'T TAKING ANY PRISONERS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
YOU EITHER BE KILLED BY THEM OR KILL THEM I WANT TO SEE THEM DEAD 
AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIFTEEN PEOPLE SPENT AN ENTIRE YEAR LIVING IN THE IRON AGE 
BREAKFAST WAS ALMOST ALWAYS A PORRIDGE OF BOILED WHEAT WITH MILK 
AND HONEY IF THERE WAS ANY 
NOW A NEW SERIES CATCHES UP WITH THE CHARACTERS 
FROM SOME OF THE BEST B. B. C. DOCUMENTARIES OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS 
AND FINDS OUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
