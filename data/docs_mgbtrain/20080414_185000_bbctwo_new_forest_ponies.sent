CREATED FOR A KING'S PLEASURE CENTURIES AGO 
AND THERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WERE SOME VERY SPECIAL HORSES 
STILL ROAMING THESE ANCIENT WOODLANDS 
THE NEW FOREST PONIES SEEM WILD AND FREE BUT EACH AUTUMN 
THE FOREST'S RESIDENTS LAY CLAIM TO THEM IN A DRAMATIC WAY 
IT'S WINTER IN THE NEW FOREST 
THE HARDEST TIME OF YEAR FOR THE FOUR THOUSAND OR SO PONIES THAT LIVE HERE 
AT THIS TIME THERE IS LITTLE FOOD AVAILABLE 
BUT THE BANDS OF PONIES ARE USED TO SCRAPING A LIVING THROUGH THE COLD MONTHS 
THESE TOUGH LITTLE CHARACTERS 
MUNCH HAPPILY ON THE INEDIBLE 
PRICKLY GORSE IS CAREFULLY PULLED INTO THEIR MOUTHS 
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE THIS WILD EXISTENCE 
UNTIL THE AUTUMN ROUND UPS 
THE PEOPLE OF THE FOREST OR COMMONERS 
HAVE BEEN KEEPING PONIES HERE FOR ALMOST ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
DURING THIS TIME THE NEW FOREST PONY HAS BECOME A DISTINCT AND HARDY BREED 
IN THE WARMTH OF SPRING NEW GROWTH PROVIDES PLENTY OF FOOD 
AND THE PONIES QUICKLY RECOVER FROM THE LEANER MONTHS 
THE FOREST COMES TO LIFE 
THE PONIES HAVE COMPETITION FROM THE FOREST'S MANY DEER 
BUT DEER ARE THE WHOLE REASON THE FOREST WAS CREATED 
WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR'S NOVA FORESTA OR NEW FOREST 
PROVIDED A MEDIAEVAL DEER HUNTING GROUND FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY 
THE DEER THRIVED AND NOW THEY ARE FOUND IN LARGE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THESE WOODLANDS 
LATE SPRING EARLY MORNING 
LAST NIGHT THIS MARE GAVE BIRTH TO HER FOAL 
THE YOUNGSTER IS UNDERSTANDABLY A BIT UNSTEADY ON ITS FEET 
A CURLY TAIL AND FOLDED OVER EARS SHOW IT IS JUST HOURS OLD 
IT ISN'T LONG BEFORE IT'S HAVING ITS FIRST MEAL 
FOR MOST OF THE YEAR THE PONIES LIVE FEED AND BREED IN THE WILD 
BUT SOON ENOUGH THEIR WILD NATURE WILL BE WELL AND TRULY REIGNED IN 
A CARPET OF BLUEBELLS COVERS THE FOREST FLOOR 
SPRING IS NEARLY AT AN END 
OUT ON THE HEATH THIS YEAR'S FOALS ARE GETTING USED TO LIFE IN THE BAND 
THE BAND'S DOMINANT STALLION KEEPS A CLOSE EYE ON PROCEEDINGS 
MAKING SURE THAT HE KEEPS CONTROL OF THE DISTRACTED NEW MOTHERS 
IN JUST A FEW WEEKS' TIME 
ALL THE PONIES WILL BE ROUNDED UP FOR THEIR YEARLY M. O. T. 
BUT FOR NOW THEY CAN RELAX IN THEIR USUAL LAID BACK MANNER 
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF AUTUMN THE OAK TREES ARE HEAVY WITH ACORNS 
SURPRISINGLY FOR PONIES THESE NUTS CAN BE LETHAL 
EACH YEAR SEVERAL DIE FROM GORGING ON THEM 
BUT THANKFULLY HELP IS AT HAND 
PIGS CAN EAT AS MANY ACORNS AS THEY LIKE WITH NO ILL EFFECT 
SO AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE COMMONERS LET THEM ROAM FREE IN THE FOREST 
IT'S AN ANCIENT PRACTISE CALLED PANAGE 
AND IT ALLOWS THE PIGS TO HOOVER UP THE ACORNS BEFORE THE PONIES CAN GET TO THEM 
AUTUMN IS RIPE 
MORNING MISTS GIVE THE FORESTS A MYSTERIOUS AIR 
AND IN THE CANOPY A TECHNICOLOR DISPLAY OF REDS AND GOLDS 
AT THE HEIGHT OF AUTUMN THE PONIES' TRANQUIL FOREST LIFE IS RUDELY INTERRUPTED 
THE TIME HAS ARRIVED FOR THE COMMONERS TO TAKE STOCK 
STARTING IN AUGUST THE PONIES ARE ROUNDED UP IN A SERIES OF DRIFTS 
CO ORDINATED BY THE AGISTERS 
AN ANCIENT TITLE FOR FIVE APPOINTED FOREST WARDENS 
SUDDENLY THE FOREST SEEMS MORE LIKE A SCENE FROM THE WILD WEST 
IT'S FOR THE GOOD OF THE PONIES 
AS THIS ROUND UP GIVES THE COMMONERS THE CHANCE TO CHECK THEIR HEALTH 
AND GIVE THEM ANY MEDICINE THEY MIGHT REQUIRE 
IT COULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE WHEN THE WINTER MONTHS RETURN 
ANY SURPLUS PONIES BORN THIS YEAR ARE SOLD AT MARKETS 
WHICH HAPPEN EACH MONTH THROUGHOUT THE AUTUMN 
AFTER THE ROUND UP THE PONIES ARE RELEASED 
AND CAN GO BACK TO THEIR VIRTUALLY WILD EXISTENCE LIVING OUT IN THE NEW FOREST 
THE NEW FOREST PONIES ARE A UNIQUE BREED 
WHICH HAVE HAD A REMARKABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE NEW FOREST FOR CENTURIES 
IT'S A TRADITION AND A PARTNERSHIP 
THAT LOOKS SET TO CONTINUE FAR INTO THE FUTURE
