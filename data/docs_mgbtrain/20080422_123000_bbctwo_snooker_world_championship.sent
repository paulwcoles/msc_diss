GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S ONLY DAY FOUR 
AT THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE IN 
SHEFFIELD AND ALREADY WE'VE HAD ONE 
COMPETITOR STEPHEN LEE THREATEN 
TO THROW AWAY HIS CUE WHENEVER PLAY 
THE GAME AGAIN WE DON'T CALL THIS 
A MARATHON OF THE MIND FOR NOTHING 
IT'S A SEVENTEEN DAY TEST OF YOUR STAMINA 
LEVELS OF YOUR MENTAL SKILLS AND 
OF YOUR POWERS OF CONCENTRATION AND 
SELF BELIEF AND IT'S PRETTY TOUGH 
ON THE PLAYERS AS WELL SERIOUSLY 
THIS SPORTS REALLY CAN PLAY WITH 
YOUR MIND AND IT'S DRIVEN SEVERAL 
PLAYERS ALMOST TO THE POINT OF 
DISTRACTION 
CONFIDENCE TO ME IT'S TEMPORARY 
IT'S FRAGILE AT ITS BEST AND IT CAN 
COME AND GO IN ONE SHOT 
LIKE A OR TEN YOU ONCE YOU START 
SLIPPING DOWN THE RANKINGS IT'S 
HARD TO STOP I'VE MANAGED TO STOP 
THE STATE AT THE MOMENT AND 
CLIMBING THE OTHER WAY 
THERE'S NO 
DOUBT HE STARTING TO BEFORE MANY 
MATCH TABLE THAT'S WHAT HE HASN'T 
BEEN DOING FOR A FEW YEARS HE'S 
BEEN PERFORMING IN PRACTICE ALL THE 
TIME BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
TAKE IT FROM ME 
IN GRAHAM'S CASE IT DOESN'T MATTER 
HOW WOULD YOU DO ON THE TABLE IT IS 
NOT GOING TO GET RID OF GRIEF 
THAT'S ONE OF THE EMOTIONS THAT 
DON'T GO AWAY VERY QUICKLY IT WILL 
IN TIME SLOWLY BUT IT'S GOING TO 
BE THERE FOR A WHILE FOR HIM AND 
HIS FAMILY 
I'VE BEEN PLAYING NINETEEN YEARS AND I'M 
JUST TOTALLY AND UTTERLY HATING THE 
GAME I HOPE I NEVER SET FOOT ON A 
SNOOKER TABLE EVER AGAIN 
IT'S SOME 
PLAYERS ARE JUST PLAIN BAD AND LACK 
CONFIDENCE AND OTHER PLAYERS HAVE A 
PERSONAL PROBLEMS THE PLAYERS THAT 
ARE PLAYING BAD WITH NO PERSONAL 
PROBLEMS NORMALLY DEVELOP PERSONAL 
PROBLEMS 
IT'S NOT THE GAME IT'S US THE 
GAME IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE SAME 
FIFTEEN REDS SIX COLOURS SIX POCKETS 
BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS US AS HUMAN 
BEINGS TURNING UP EVERY DAY THE 
WAKE HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT MOODS THE THE SMALLEST THING CAN TILT THAT 
BALANCE THAT LINE THAT YOU'RE 
LOOKING FOR HAVE BEEN CONFIDENT 
YOU CAN BE JUST ABOVE IT OR JUST 
BELOW IT AND YOU CAN BE TERRIBLE 
SO CLOSE SO FINAL 
IT IS A FINE LINE BETWEEN SUCCESS 
AND FAILURE THERE IS SO LITTLE 
BETWEEN THE PLAYERS TALENT WISE 
THEY ARE ALL COMPETITIVE SOMETIMES 
IT COMES DOWN TO ONE BALL 
EVEN IN 
A BEST OF NINETEEN MATCH ONE SHOT COULD 
BE THE CRITICAL ONE YOU ONLY HAVE 
TO LOOK UP THE PRESS CONFERENCE HAS 
TO SAY WHAT IT MEANS TO THE PLAYERS 
THE WINNERS DELIGHTED THE LOSERS 
DISTRAUGHT 
STEPHEN HENDRY DISTRAUGHT YESTERDAY IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN 
THE BLUE COMES OVER AND THAT ALSO 
BLACK IF THAT GOES IN A TOTALLY 
DIFFERENT GAME 
YOU STILL GOT TO 
POT YOUR BALLS AT THE END OF IT 
WHAT ABOUT YOU THOUGHT YOU DID 
GREAT CAME BACK TO EIGHTY EIGHT ANY BALLS 
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE GOT WHAT 
ABOUT WHEN YOU'VE LOST POSITION ON 
THE BLUE AND YOU HAVEN'T QUITE GOT 
ON THE PINK 
I DON'T WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT IT AND 
YOU'VE POT THE 
ABOUT IT PINK AND GONE IN OFF 
BUT EVEN THEN YOU ENDED UP WITH 
ANOTHER CHANCE FOR THE BLACK 
DOWN THE CUSHION WHAT VALUE THE 
MONEY YOU GAVE THE EXCITEMENT LAST 
NIGHT YOU MUST BE PLEASED WITH 
YOURSELF PLAYING LIKE THAT YEAH YEAH IT'S GREAT 
WE'VE SEEN OTHER 
PLAYERS THIS BE TALKING ABOUT PACK 
IN THE GAME IN YOU ARE NOT GOING 
TO DO THAT ARE YOU 
NO I'VE GOT 
NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND THERE IS 
ALSO A CHALLENGE OF GETTING BACK 
INTO THE TOP SIXTEEN THERE ARE STILL A 
GAME THAT HAVE A LOT OF TALENT AS 
FOR A PLAYER PERHAPS THIS IS 
COMING OFF THE BACK OF INTERVIEWS 
AFTER THEY HAVE LOST MATCHES L. 
DON'T NECESSARY THING AND A COLD 
LIGHT OF DAY THAT IS HOW THEY FEEL 
BUT IF THEY WANT TO GIVE UP THAT'S 
FINE BY ME PROBABLY BY YOU AS WELL

GRIT MY TEETH AND MANAGED TO DO IS

SNOOKER IN THE NIGHT SESSION L. 
MANAGED TO KEEP DIGGING AWAY AND 
COME THROUGH THE MATCH IT WAS 
GREAT 
PLEASE PUT YOUR HANDS GREAT TOGETHER FOR MARK SELBY WELSH OPEN 
CHAMPION TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
THIS YEAR I SAID MY 
GOAL TO FINISH IN THE TOP EIGHT AND 
WIN A MAJOR TITLE I'VE WON TWO 
MAJOR TITLES AND AN GUARANTEED IN 
THE TOP EIGHT NOW I'VE GOT TO SET 
MY GOALS A LOT HIGHER BUT IT WOULD 
BE GREAT TO WIN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP THIS YEAR 
IN THIS TALE OF TWO MARKS IT WAS 
SELBY WHO DREW FIRST WHILST DEALING 
THE OPENING FRAME WITH A FIFTY FIVE 
CLEARANCE KING DIDN'T LOOK BEST 
PLEASED THE ROMFORD MAN RESPONDED 
BY TAKING FRAME TWO AND WAS WELL 
AHEAD IN THE THIRD BUT THE 
OBDURATE MASTERS CHAMPION CAME BACK 
AGAIN TO CLINCH IT ON THE PINK TO ONE 
WHEN IT COULD HAVE SO EASILY BEEN 
THREE TO ZERO TICKING TWO KING AFTER THAT 
KING WAS BACK ON THE DOOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ONLY 
TO SEE THE LAST RED METAL IN THE 
DRAW JAWS RATTLE IN THE JAWS 
SELBY THEN STARTED TO SHOW SOME OF 
THE QUALITIES WHICH HAD EARNED HIM 
TWO TITLES THIS TERM A SEVENTY SIX BREAK 
HELPED HIM REGAIN THE LEAD AT FOUR TO THREE 
KING RESTORED PARITY BUT WAS 
VISIBLY UPSET WITH HIMSELF FOR 
GIVING SELBY ONCE AGAIN A CHANCE TO 
SNATCH VICTORY ON THE PINK THREE 
BIG STEELS FOR SELBY HAVE GIVEN HIM 
A SLENDER FIVE TO FOUR ADVANTAGE GOING INTO 
THE FINAL SESSION MARK KING AND 
MARK SELBY RETURN TO THE ARENA AT 
TEN A M. THIS MORNING TO COMPLETE THEIR 
MATCH JOHN VIRGO AND DENNIS TAYLOR 
ARE HAND WE'RE GOING TO PICK UP 
WITH KING HE MADE A SUPERB START 
THIS IS THE THIRTEENTH FRAME WE'RE GOING 
TO IT SELBY AT THE TABLE NOW 
HELLO WHAT A TIMELY 
FLUKE THAT WAS HE IS PERFECT ON 
THE BLUE AND LOOKS TO HAVE THE 
PERFECT ANGLE 
IT'S 
AMAZING JOHN WHAT A FLUKE 
ESPECIALLY WITH THAT BLUE RIGHT 
OVER THE POCKET 
THIS COULD BE ANOTHER KEY TURNING 
POINT 
YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE SKILL POINT IN THE WORLD BUT YOU CAN'T BEAT 
THAT BIT OF LUCK HE IS GOING TO 
SUPPER NOW PARTICULARLY OF MARKING 
MAKES THE MOST OF THAT FLUKE AND 
WINS THIS FRAME 
SEE HOW CLOSE HIS HAND IS TO THE 
CUE BALL AT TIMES WHEN HE HAS GOT 
HIS HAND ON THE TABLE 
HE IS NOT FAR AWAY IS HE HE HAS 
PLAYED A POOR POSITIONAL SHOT HE 
HAS STILL GOT A POT ON HE DIDN'T 
JUDGE THE CANNON AS HE WANTED 
IT SHOULD RUN THROUGH IF HE PUTS 
THIS TO GIVE HIMSELF CHANCE OF FINISHING ON THE BLUE 
NEVER ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE 
OUTCOME IT IS A TRICKY BLACK 
HE IS GOING TO WIPE HIS CUE AND HIS 
HANDS HE KNOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF 
THIS 
UNCERTAIN WHEN HE CAME OUT THIS 
MORNING AND HE WAS FIVE TO FOUR BEHIND TO 
WIN ALL THE GAMES AT THE START OF 
THE SESSION IS A BONUS BUT IT IS 
CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY NOW HE HAS 
PLAYED THAT DELIGHTFULLY 
THIS IS AS WELL AS MARK KING HAS 
PLAYED FOR A LONG TIME 
HE IS GIVING US AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT 
HE CAN DO HE MISJUDGED THAT'S LIKE 
THE POINT HE DID NOT EXPECT THE 
CANNON ON THE RED THAT SLIGHTLY 
I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WILL BE VERY 
INTERESTED IN THIS ROCKY TAYLOR 
WHO STARRED IN THE EARLY BOND 
MOVIES FOUR TO ONE HE GOT FOR MARK KING TO 
WIN THIS MATCH I'M SURE HE HAD A 
FEW POUNDS ON IT 
MARK SELBY WAS THE FORM PLAYER AND 
THAT WAS VERY GENEROUS ODDS IF 
MARK KING CAN PULL THIS OFF WE 
WILL ALL HAVE A DRINK ON HIM IT IT WAS BIG ODDS IN THE TWO HORSE RACE 
BUT MARK SELBY HAS BEEN THE PLAYER 
OF THE SEASON SO FAR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE EXPECTED HIM TO MAKE A BOLD 
BID FOR THIS TITLE BUT HE IS 
STRUGGLING HERE 
MARK KING LOOKING FOR ONE MORE RED 
AFTER THIS BLUE HE IS CHECKING TO 
SEE IF ONE OF THE REDS WILL GO TO 
THE RIGHT CENTRE WHAT A TURN UP 
I'M EULOGISING THE BREAK BUT IT 
STARTED WITH A FLUKE 
YOU CAN'T 
BEAT A BIT OF LUCK BUT HE HAS 
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT AND HE HIS 
CUEING VERY WELL AT THE MOMENT 
I DON'T THINK MARK SELBY WILL BE 
BOTHERED ABOUT CARRYING ON IT 
SHOULD BE EIGHT FIVE TO MARK KING 
HE HAS WON THE FIRST FOUR FRAMES 
MARK 
SELBY DID MANAGE 
TO STOP THE ROT BY WINNING FRAME FOURTEEN 
SO IN WE GO TO THE NEXT FRAME 
THERE IS A POT ONTO THE RIGHT 
CORNER BUT THERE IS NO GAP TO GET 
THE CUE BALL BACK UP THE TABLE HE 
IS STILL LOOKING AT THIS POT THE 
BLACK IS NEAR THE MIDDLE POCKET 
BUT IT LOOKS ALMOST CERTAIN TO 
CANNON ANOTHER BALL 
THAT IS THE RED HE IS LOOKING AT 
BUT HE HAS GONE TO THE ONE ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE 
A 
THAT IS ANOTHER GREAT SHOT AND HE 
IS ON THE BLUE 
HE DID THIS IN THE PREVIOUS FRAME HE HAS DONE IT AGAIN I THINK HE 
THOUGHT HE HAD MISSED THAT ONE HE 
IS PUTTING HIS HEART WHEN YOU ROLL 
ACROSS IT IS SO EASY TO PUT IT ON 
THE JAW OF A POCKET HE THOUGHT 
THAT WAS GOING TO STAY OUT KEEP 
GOING KEEP GOING 
HE JUST WANTED THAT CUE BALL TO RUN 
A LITTLE BIT FURTHER HE IS ON THE 
BLACK BUT HE IS HAMPERED IF YOU 
CAN GET THE BRIDGE HAND FLAT ON THE 
TABLE IT ALWAYS HELPS IT HAS NOT 
GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CUE 
BALL BUT THIS IS SLIGHTLY TRICKY 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO A LOT WITH THE 
CUE BALL THE WAY HE IS PLAYING IT 
JUST PARTIES THE BLUE PARTIES 
HE IS HAVING THE WHITE CLEANED HE 
LOOKS A BIT MORE RELAXED NOW AND A 
BIT MORE CONFIDENT IT IS AMAZING 
THAT HE WAS THREE FRAMES BEHIND 
BUT THAT IS THE SIGN OF A GREAT 
PLAYER AND A TRUE CHAMPION 
I WAS 
JUST THINKING EXACTLY THE SAME 
THING 
FOR ALL THE SKILLS YOU NEED TO PLAY 
THIS GAME YOU WILL NOT BE A 
CHAMPION WITHOUT A GOOD TEMPERAMENT 
AND HE HAS 
GOT BACK IN SPADES 
HE CAN EVEN HAVE A LITTLE JOKE WITH 
THE AUDIENCE SOMETHING I KNOW YOU 
WERE ALWAYS CAPABLE OF GIVING BUT 
I ALWAYS FOUND DIFFICULT IT WAS 
ALL RIGHT IN AN EXHIBITION BUT IN 
THE HEAT OF BATTLE 
STRAIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A POCKET 
HE LOOKS VERY COMFORTABLE OUT THERE 
THAT WAS PRESSURE POT 
BUT HE IS CERTAINLY GROWING IN 
CONFIDENCE VERY IMPRESSIVE MARK 
KING WILL BE GETTING A LITTLE BIT 
CONCERNED BUT HE WILL BE WANTING TO 
GET THE CHANCE 
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE APART FROM 
THE FIRST FRAME THIS MORNING WHERE 
BOTH PLAYERS HAD CHANCES MARK KING 
WON THAT ONE BUT MARK SELBY DIDN'T 
HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE IN THE NEXT 
THREE YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO STAY 
FOCUSED BE PATIENT YOUR CHANCE 
WILL COME EVENTUALLY 
THERE WAS A CASE WHERE HE HAD A 
CHOICE OF THREE OR FOUR REDS TO 
PLAY ON BUT THIS ONE WAS ALWAYS 
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IT IS 
LEAVING YOURSELF OPTIONS THAT IS 
PERFECT 
THAT WAS A POSITIONAL SHOT OUT OF 
THE TOP DRAWER 
THIS BLACK WILL PUT HIM SIXTY POINTS 
IN FRONT 
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN IN 
JOHN AT THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
WHEN IT CHANGES THINGS AROUND MARK 
KING TAKING ALL FOUR AND NOW IT'S 
ALL MARK SELBY 
THAT IS THE FRAME WELL AND TRULY 
OVER THE ONLY QUESTION NOW IS WILL 
WE SEE THE SECOND CENTURY OF THE 
MATCH 
EVEN IF WE DON'T SEE A CENTURY WE 
ARE GOING TO SEE MARK SELBY'S 
HIGHEST BREAK UP THE MATCH 
IT'S COMING TO STOP THE RIGHT TIME 
HE DID HAVE SEVENTY SIX BREAK IN FRAME 
SEVEN IT'S COMING JUST AT THE 
RIGHT TIME 
IN HIS SHORT CAREER HE HAS MADE SIXTEEN 
CENTURIES AT THE CRUCIBLE 
HE MADE TWENTY NINE CENTURIES LAST SEASON 
AND HE HAS ALREADY MADE TWENTY FIVE THIS 
SEASON 
HE IS GOING TO NEED THE DIFFICULT BROWN 
JUST DROP IN BEHIND THE BROWN AND 
HE WON'T BE PLAYING TO GET ONTO THE 
BLUE JUST ROLL THE BROWN IN 
THE FRAME IS OVER WHEREAS THIS ONE 
GOING TO GO 
ONLY A FLUKE WOULD GET IT BUT IT 
DIDN'T MATTER MARK KING GETTING A 
BIT CONCERNED NOW HE WON THE FIRST 
FOUR BUT AFTER THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL MARK SELBY HAS WON THE 
TWO FRAMES THEY PLAYED HE'S 
REDUCED HIS OWN WEEK HIS ARREARS 
TO ONLY ONE 
WE SAW THIS AT THE CRUCIBLE LAST 
YEAR THE MORE THE PRESSURE SEEMS 
TO SQUEEZE THE WORLD NUMBER ELEVEN 
MARK SELBY THE BETTER HE RESPONDS 
CAN HE KEEP IT GOING 
BRILLIANT IF ANYTHING HE HIT THIS 
TOO WELL WATCH THE REACTION OF THE 
CUE BALL IT WENT CLOSE TO THE SIDE 
CUSHION 
THAT'S NOT A BAD SIGN IT MEANS 
YOU'RE CUEING PERFECTLY I SUPPOSE 
HE'S LOOKED AT THE BLUE HE'S LOOK 
AT THE BROWN HE'S NOT YET LOOK AT 
THE BLACK THERE'S QUITE A DISTANCE 
AND I THINK WHAT PUTS HIM OFF THE 
BLACK A LITTLE BIT IS THE FACT THAT 
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY 
DELICATELY L. THINK THE BLACK MIGHT 
BE WORTH A GO IF HE COULD GET A 
LITTLE CANNON ON THE REDS SECOND 
RIGHT AS WE LOOK 
YES I LIKE 
THAT ONE JOHN THAT IS ON 
IF HE GETS THE CANNON THE WHITE 
SHOULD FINISH SOMEWHERE AROUND THAT 
CIRCLE 
IN THE END HE DECIDED TO PLAY WITH 
MORE PACE TO TRY AND DROP ON RED 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLUSTER HE'S 
JUST ABOUT GOT THERE 
HE MIGHT PLAY FOR THE RIGHT OF THE 
TWO REDS THIS TIME GET IT OUT OF 
THE WAY 
WATCH WHERE HE LEAVES THE CUE BALL 
HERE OH HE HAS TOOK HIS EYE OF 
THE BLACK WHAT A MISS 
AND THERE YOU GO JUST THOUGHT SO 
MUCH ABOUT THE POSITION ON THE RED 
TOOK FOR GRANTED THE BLACK OFF THE 
SPOT 
JUST WHEN IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HE 
WAS IN AGAIN AND GETTING STRONGER 
BY THE SHOT AND LOOKING AS THOUGH 
HE HAD A CHANCE TO LEVEL THE MATCH 
A CHANCE FOR MARK KING THE FIRST 
CHANCE HE HAS HAD SINCE THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL TO PUT HIS HAND ON 
THE TABLE AND PUT SOME BALLS 
WE KNOW HOW DETERMINED MARK KING IS 
HE HAS BEEN KEPT OFF THE TABLE BUT 
WE KNOW HE IS IN GOOD FORM 
CAN HE GET PAST THE BLACK ON THIS 
RED YES HE CAN 
HE PLAYS THOSE SHOTS HE SORT OF 
CUES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BALL AND 
EVENTUALLY WHEN HE DELIVERS THE 
CUE HE GOES A BIT LOW ON IT 
HE HAS NOT PLAYED THAT WELL HE 
SHOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER ANGLE ON 
THE BLACK AND THIS I'M SURPRISED 
HE DIDN'T PLAY FOR THE BLACK AND 
THE SAME POCKET AS THE RED 
IF HE SCREWS THIS BACK I THINK HE 
MIGHT BE CLOSE TO GOING TO CANNON 
INTO THE RED THAT'S CLOSE TO THE 
CUSHION HE HAS JUST ABOUT MISSED IT 
I THINK HE HAS HAD A BONUS HERE I 
THINK THE RED HE IS ON I DON'T 
THINK THAT THE ONE HE PLAYED FOR 
HE PLAYED FOR THE RED TO THE RIGHT 
OF THAT THAT WAS BONUS TO BE ON THAT ONE 
HOW COSTLY IS THAT SITTER OF A 
BLACK THAT MARK SELBY MISSED GOING 
TO BE PERFECT ISN'T HE 
THERE IS ONE THAT HAS TO BE PUSHED 
TOWARDS THE RIGHT CORNER AND MAYBE 
ONE TOWARDS THE LEFT CORNER HE 
DOESN'T WANT TO GO INTO EASY INTO 
THEM OTHERWISE HE COULD STICK IN 
THE TWO REDS SO HE NEEDS A BIT OF 
PACE TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T STICK 
HE WILL SETTLE FOR THAT WHAT A BIG 
FRAME THIS IS 
MARK SELBY MUST BE SAT IN HIS SEAT 
ABSOLUTELY SEETHING KIDDING 
HIMSELF KICKING 
MARK KING IS NOW BIG FAVOUR TO TAKE 
THIS FRAME YOU FEEL ONE POSITIONAL OFF THIS BLACK HE HAS GOT IT 
HE'S GOING TO NEED RED COLOUR RED 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOME SORT OF A 
STRANGE RING TONE 
MOBILE PHONES ARE NOT ALLOWED INTO 
THE MASTERS GOLF THEY TAKE THEM 
OFF THEM AND THEY HAVE TAKEN OFF 
THEM IF THEY ARE CAUGHT WITH ONE 
I'M A BIT SURPRISED HE'S PLAYING 
THIS RED 
IF HE PLAYED THE RED THAT'S LOW ON 
THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE HE WOULD 
OPEN THE OTHER REDS 
HE HAS POTTED IT BUT HE HAS NOT 
COME HIGH ENOUGH ON THE BLACK THIS 
IS A TRICKY BLACK HE IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO PLAY GOOD SHOT TO GET THE 
CANNON WITH SUCH AN ACUTE POTTING 
ANGLE 
YET BECAUSE HE'S GOT TO GET ANGLE IN THERE REALLY WITH THE WHITE IF 
HE JUST FLICKS THE END RED HE MAY 
HAVE RUN OUT OF POSITION 
HE HAS AFFLICTED BUT HE IS O. K. HE 
HAS PUT IT INTO A POSSIBLE POSITION 
HE HAS AFFLICTED IT 
HE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER NOW IF HE 
CAN GET THE CANNON THAT'S BONUS 
MARK SELBY WELL DECEIVING HE WAS 
FLYING A LONG AND LOOKED TO BE BACK 
TO HIS BEST FORM HE WILL BE 
SEETHING 
FAIR PLAY TO MARK KING MARK SELBY 
HAD CLOSE THE GAP TO JUST ONE FRAME 
THE PRESSURE WAS STARTING TO COME 
ON MARK KING BUT HE TOOK THEM WELL 
YES HE'D BEEN KEPT OFF THE TABLE 
FOR TWO FRAMES 
HE HAS ALREADY HAD ONE CENTURY IN 
THIS MATCH HE HAS MADE FIFTY FOUR IN HIS 
CAREER 
HE MAKES A LOT OF FRAME WINNING 
BREAKS BUT YOU WOULD NOT SAY HE 
MAKES A LOT OF CENTURIES FOUR THIS 
SEASON FIVE LAST SEASON LOOK AT THIS 
FOR AN EXHIBITION SHOT TO GET ON 
THE BROWN HE STILL HAS GOT THE 
CHANCE OF IT THIS TRICKY BROWN TO 
GIVE HIMSELF THE CHANCE OF THE 
CENTURY VERY WELL PLAYED ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC ANOTHER TERRIFIC EXHIBITION SHOT 
HAD LOST THE FIRST TWO AFTER THE 
INTERVAL BUT WHAT A COMEBACK FROM 
MARK KING THAT WAS A MAGNIFICENT 
CENTURY BREAK A BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN HE 
IS ONE AWAY FROM A PLACE IN THE 
SECOND ROUND IN THE SECOND ROUND MARK SELBY WON THE NEXT FRAME TO 
NARROW THE GAP THE TENSION LEVELS 
REALLY ARE RISING MARK SELBY HAS 
MADE A DECENT START IN THE EIGHTEENTH 
FRAME HE IS TWENTY THREE POINTS UP 
HAS HE GOT AWAY WITH IT HE HAS 
FORCED NOT HE HAS YOU WOULD HAVE 
TO SAY THIS IS NOT EASY UP THE 
CUSHION L. THINK MARK SELBY WAS A 
BIT AND JUST WHEN HE KNEW HE DID 
NOT PLAY THIS SAFETY SHOT AS HE 
INTENDED BIT ANXIOUS 
WELL PLAYED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE 
AUDIENCE SHARE PINK COME ON MARK 
WE DO NOT KNOW WHICH ONE THEY MEAN 
HE HAS FOUND A SHOT THERE SUPERB 
HE COULD NOT HAVE LANDED BETTER 
COULD NOT HAVE LANDED BETTER LOOK 
AT THIS PERFECT WELL YOU HAVE 
BEEN WATCHING THAT GOOD SHOT HE 
HAS DISPATCHED THE RED AND HE IS 
NICELY ON THE BLACK BUT NOW HE IS 
HAVING LOOK WHERE THE BLACK WILL GO 
IT COULD BE TIED UP SOMEWHAT HERE 
BECAUSE ALL OF THE OTHER SPOTS 
OCCUPIED THE PINK IS ON THE BLACK 
SPOT THE BLACK WILL STILL BE 
AVAILABLE 
AS CLOSE TO THE PINK WITHOUT 
TOUCHING IT THE PINK WILL NOT POT 
BUT THE BLACK WILL GO 
HE IS O. K. 
THIS IS A TEST OF NERVE 
THIS IS A CHANCE TO WIN FRAME AND 
MATCH AT THIS VISIT IT IS JUST 
APPALLING UP ALL ABOUT HOLDING 
YOURSELF TOGETHER 
A COUPLE OF REDS TO PLAY ON ONE 
NEAR THE PINK SPOT THE ONE TO THE 
RIGHT OF THE FOUR 
HE WILL BE PROBABLY PLAYING BLACK 
FOR THE BLUE BACK FOR THE BLUE THE PINK SPOT SEEMS TO BE CLEAR NOW 
IF HE DID POT THE BLACK IN A COUPLE 
OF SHOTS TIME HE WOULD HAVE TO GO 
ON TO THE PINK SPOT AND POSSIBLY 
ABOVE COMMISSION OF COMMISSION 
IT HAS OPENED THE REDS HE HAS LEFT 
HIMSELF A TRICKY ONE ALONG THE 
CUSHION HE CAN STILL GET TO THE 
BLACK OFF THIS HE DOES NOT 
PARTICULARLY LIKE THE OUTCOME HE 
WANTED A FULLER CONTACT WHAT AN 
IMPORTANT SHOT COMING UP NOW YOU 
CANNOT BLAME HIM FOR WIPING THE CUE 
AND HIS HANDS 
YES BUT IT IS A 
SHOT WITH SO MUCH REWARD 
HE HAS GOT A DECENT ENOUGH ANGLE ON 
THE RED ALONG THE TOP CUSHION AND 
IF HE CAN KNOCK IT IN GET ON THE 
BLACK THE PINK SPOT IS NOW CLEAR 
UP THE BLACK WOULD GO ON THE PINK 
SPOT AND THE REDS ARE BEAUTIFULLY 
SPREAD 
HE PLAYED IT WELL HAS HE GONE HIGH 
ENOUGH TO PLAY THE BLACK 
I THINK 
HE IS O. K. I THINK IT WILL BE BLACK FIRST 
DEFINITELY BLACK FIRST WHERE IS 
THE WHITE GOING HE IS O. K. WHAT A 
CHANCE NOW WHAT A MATCH THIS HAS 
TURNED OUT TO BE MARK KING HAS 
MADE A COUPLE OF CENTURY BREAKS 
MARK SELBY HAS MADE A CENTURY IT 
HAS BEEN HIGH QUALITY STUFF BUT IS 
THE RUNNER UP ON HIS WAY OUT IN THE 
FIRST ROUND THE RUNNER UP FROM 
LAST YEAR AND THE MAN IN FORM THIS 
SEASON TWO MAJOR TOURNAMENTS THE 
WELSH OPEN AND THE MASTERS 
IT IS FIRMLY IN THE HANDS OF MARK 
KING EVERY CREDIT TO THIS YOUNG 
MAN HE HAS PLAYED AS GOOD AS I 
HAVE SEEN HIM PLAY HERE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE 
HE HAS JUST GOT TO HOLD HIMSELF 
TOGETHER FOR TWENTY FIVE HE NEEDS THREE 
OF THE REMAINING FOUR REDS TO BE 
CERTAIN FOR VICTORY 
HE IS RANKED AT NO TWENTY ONE IN THE WORLD 
PROVISIONALLY NUMBER EIGHTEEN 
IT GET A BIT COMPLICATED THE 
RANKINGS YOU WOULD FEEL THAT THIS 
WOULD DEFINITELY PUT HIM IN THE TOP 
SIXTEEN BUT HE WILL NOT BE THINKING 
ABOUT THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT GETTING 
THROUGH TO THE SECOND ROUND IT IS GETTING A BIT NERVY OUT THERE 
JUST THIS RED MARK SELBY WOULD 
KNOW IT IS THE END OF THIS YEAR'S 
EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT COM WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
THAT LOOKS TO BE IT HE HAS HAD A 
GREAT SEASON BUT IT ENDS HERE 
I AM WITH YOU I THINK THIS IS ONE 
OF MARK KING'S BEST PERFORMANCES 
FOR SOME TIME HE LOST HERE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO 
TO KEN DOHERTY ON THE DECIDING 
FRAME IN THE SECOND ROUND THIRTEEN TO TWELVE 
BUT THIS WILL MEAN SO MUCH TO HIM 
IT HAS FINISHED RATHER AWKWARDLY 
HE IS HAVING A 
WATER HE

BREAK BUILDER BUT YOU SHOWED THERE

INTRODUCING THE EUROPEAN OPEN 
FINALIST WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
QUARTER FINALIST INTO ONE THOUSAND FOUR JOE 
PERRY TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
FINALLY THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN CHINA OPEN WINNER 
SUPERB TO SEE HIM BACK IN ACTION 
THIS AFTERNOON GRAEME DOTT 
DENNIS TAYLOR IS IN 
POSITION IN THE COMMENTARY BOX A 
ROUSING WELCOME FOR GRAEME DOTT 
GOOD TO SEE HIM HERE 
ABSOLUTELY A 
BIG DECISION FOR GRAEME DOTT TO 
COME AND PLAY HERE IN THIS YEAR'S 
EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP L. AM SURE 
EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE GAME OF 
SNOOKER WHICH IS HIM ALL THE BEST 
AND I AM SURE THEY WILL ALSO WISH 
HIS OPPONENT JOE PERRY GOT ALL THE 
BEST JOE PERRY 
ALWAYS NICE TO GET A GOOD BREAK OFF 
SHOT ON YOUR OPENING FRAME HE 
DIDN'T QUITE GET THE WHITE AS FAR 
ROVER AS HE ANTICIPATED AND HAS 
LEFT A POSSIBLE CUT FOR GRAEME DOTT 
OVER 
MUCH TOO THIN NOT THE WAY TO START 
YOUR OPENING FRAME 
IT IS A HALF 
BALL SHOT AND HE CAUGHT IT VERY 
THIN INDEED 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT MADE OF GRAEME 
DOTT'S OBVIOUS PROBLEMS HE HAS HAD 
A VERY BAD SEASON AND HE IS 
SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION BUT IT 
HAS BEEN BANDIED ABOUT THAT HE 
WOULD NOT PLAY IT IS GREAT TO SEE 
HIM HERE OBVIOUSLY L. L. THINK IT HAS 
PUT THE PRESSURE ON HIS OPPONENT 
SOMEWHAT 
HE IS PLAYING SOMEONE THAT WON THE 
WORLD CHAMPION TWO YEARS AGO AND 
HE IS EXPECTED TO WIN NOW A LITTLE 
BIT OF PRESSURE ON THE MAN FROM 
CAMBRIDGE 
A LITTLE BIT OF A HEADY CONTACT HAS 
PULLED THE WHITE UP SHORT OF WHERE 
IT WOULD HAVE FINISHED HEAVY HE 
IS STILL ON THE RED NOT AS 
STRAIGHTFORWARD TO GET BACK ON TO 
THE BLACK BECAUSE OF THAT HEAVY 
CONTACT 
I'M SURE JOE SWAIL WILL JUST PLAY 
THE BALLS AND CONCENTRATE ON THAT 
CAN HE GET CANNON ON WANTED OF 
THE REDS TO THE RIGHT OF THE PACK 
ONE 
I THINK HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT HE 
HAS BEEN RATHER FORTUNATE THERE 
YOU CAN SEE THAT LITTLE PLASTER ON 
HIS CHIN THAT IS FOR THE CUE TO 
RUN A LONG 
DAVE HAROLD USED TO HAVE A PLASTER 
ON HIS CHIN SO DID DEAN CAIN NEW NEW ZEALAND'S TOP PLAYER 
THE OTHER 
PROBLEM MAY BE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE 
A CUE THAT SENDS A FEW SPLINTERS 
OUT IF THAT WAS THE CASE EVERYONE 
WOULD WHERE ONE OF THOSE WEAR 
I THINK THE KEY TO GRAEME DOTT'S 
CHANCES IS HOW TENACIOUS HE WANTS 
TO BE THAT IS HIS STRENGTH HE 
NEVER GOES AWAY MAKES THINGS 
DIFFICULT FOR YOU ALL THE TIME IF 
HE HAS GOT BACK HE HAS GOT A GOOD 
CHANCE 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD POT I THINK 
HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE FOUND THE 
GAP WITH HALF THE CANNON BUT THE 
FACT HE KNOCKED THIS IN HE THOUGHT 
HE WOULD MISS THAT RED AND HE 
DESERVES SOMETHING BETTER THAN THIS 
HE TOOK THE POT ON HE PLAYED A 
VERY ATTACKING SHOT CLOSE TO THE 
BAULK CUSHION A CHANCE FOR GRAEME 
DOTT 
NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CHOICE OF 
SHOT HE FANCIED THAT ONE 
GRAEME DOTT WHEN HE WON THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS WAS BEING HELPED BY 
A MAN WHO DOES A LOT OF WORK FOR 
LOT OF THE PLAYERS IN THE LAST 
WEEK OR TWO HE HAS BEEN GIVING 
GRAEME DOTT A BIT MORE HELP WITH 
HIS GAME HE PLAYED SOME KIND OF 
POT IN HIM WINNING THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP TWO YEARS AGO IN MY 
OPINION 
I THINK WITH THE TOP PLAYERS WHEN 
YOU GET SOMEONE LIKE STEPHEN HENDRY 
HAVING COACH HE HAS GOT CHRIS 
HENRY WITH HIM IT IS MORE OF 
MENTAL THING GETTING THEM PREPARED 
AND IF YOU WIN SEVEN WORLD TITLES 
THERE IS NOT LOT WRONG WITH YOUR ACTION 
BUT THIS IS JUST THE START THAT 
GRAEME DOTT WANTED AND HE HAS GOT 
THE PERFECT ANGLE TO DROP ON THE 
THAT IS A POOR SHOT HE SEEMED TO 
GO DOWN A BIT QUICK ON THAT ONE HE 
WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE LONG ONE PAST 
THE BLUE IT WASN'T THE BEST OF 
POSITIONAL SHOTS WHEN HE GOT 
HIMSELF ONTO THE BLACK AT THE LAST SECOND THE CUE GOES 
DOWN AND HE WINS THE POINT THAT 
ONE POSITIONAL ERROR IS NOW 
FORGOTTEN 
IN AWAY HE MAY HAVE TAKEN THE 
PRESSURE OFF HIMSELF IN THE LAST 
WEEK THE FACT THAT HE WAS THINKING 
OF NOT PLAYING AND NOW HE IS 
PLAYING HOPEFULLY HE CAN ENJOY THE 
MATCH WHICH SOMETIMES CAN LEAD TO 
SOMEBODY PLAYING REALLY WELL 
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE 
WON A MATCH HE REACHED THE SEMI 
FINALS IN SHANGHAI AT THE START OF 
THE SEASON NOTHING SINCE 
HE WILL HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM 
HIS FAMILY AND CERTAINLY HIS WIFE 
AND THEIR THREE YEAR OLD SON LOUIS 
I AM SURE THAT WILL HELP GRAEME A 
GREAT DEAL IT IS A FLUENT START 
THAT IS SOMETHING HE DID A FEW 
SEASONS AGO HE DECIDED TO SPEED UP 
AND PLAY THE WAY HE USED TO 
I THINK HE WAS UNFAIRLY LABELLED AS 
A SLOW PLAYER L. DO NOT THINK HE 
WAS EVER THAT SLOW HE IS QUITE 
QUICK WHEN HE GETS GOING 
THIS WILL MAKE HIM FEEL MUCH BETTER 
ABOUT THINGS IF HE CAN WIN THIS 
FRAME IN ONE VISIT 
JUST A BIT STRAIGHT ON THIS RED 
BUT IT IS THE RED THAT HE NEED TO 
CLINCH THE FRAME VIRTUALLY 
HE IS FORTY FOUR IN FRONT DIPPING T. 
MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE THERE IS FORTY THREE 
ON THE TABLE THE PINK TO MAKE 
ABSOLUTELY SURE THE PERFECT START 
IT IS A GREAT START FROM GRAEME 
DOTT YOU WOULD THINK IS SIXTY FOUR BREAK 
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM THE 
OPENING FRAME THE SIXTY FOUR BREAK 
TWO FOUR POINT SNOOKERS REQUIRED AT 
THE MOMENT SO IT IS WORTH CARRYING 
ON 
JOE PERRY COULD DO WITH A RED AND A 
BLACK HERE 
THE ATTEMPT AT THE POT THERE NO 
ATTEMPT 
YOU CAN SEE THE CHALK MARKS ON THE 
CLOTH WHEN THE PLAYERS PLAYING 
SCREW SHOTS IT LEAVES A MARK OF 
QUEEN CHALK ON THE BAIZE GREEN 
CHALK 
JUST TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHEN 
GRAEME DOTT STARTED TO STRUGGLE 
WITH HIS FORM HE WON IN CHINA AS 
WORLD CHAMPION AND HE LOST LAST 
YEAR HERE TO IAN MCCULLOCH THOSE 
TWO DO NOT SEND EACH OTHER 
CHRISTMAS CARDS IT WAS A BLOW TO 
HIM HE NEVER SEEMED TO RECOVER 
REALLY BUT THIS WOULD HELP IF HE 
COULD GET THROUGH THIS MATCH 
HE HAS MADE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT 
HE NEEDS A BIT OF GOOD LUCK HERE 
YOU CAN SOMETIMES WHEN FRAMES LIKE 
THIS WITH A SNOOKER AND A FREE BALL 
IT DOES NOT HAPPEN OFTEN THIS IS 
NOT A BAD EFFORT HE STILL HAS GOT 
THE SNOOKER L. DO NOT THINK HE CAN 
GO TO THE RIGHT BECAUSE GREEN AND 
BROWN ARE IN THE WAY 
AND THE 
YELLOW IS IN THE WAY ON THE LEFT 
OR PARTIALLY ON THE WAY IN THE 
WAY HE WOULD HAVE TO GO SO CLOSE 
TO THE YELLOW TO ESCAPE FROM THIS 
THAT IS THE NATURAL ANGLE IF HE 
PLAYED WITH A TOUCH OF SIDE BUT 
LOOK HOW CLOSE HE WOULD HAVE TO GO 
TO THE YELLOW THIS COULD GO WRONG 
THAT IS THE LINE HE WOULD HAVE TO 
TAKE VERY LITTLE MARGIN OF ERROR 
HE CANNOT HIT IT HARD BECAUSE HE 
WILL NOT WANT TO LEAVE A FREE BALL 
HE HAS PLAYED IT SLOWLY AS WE 
THOUGHT A VERY WELL PLAYED 
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A LITTLE 
THIN ONE HERE AND AVOID THE BLUE 
THAT IS NOT A BAD CHOICE I DO NOT 
THINK HE HAS GOT THE SNOOKER BUT 
IT WAS NOT A BAD EFFORT 
SOMETIMES YOU GET A GASP FROM THE 
AUDIENCE THEY THINK YOU HAVE GONE 
FOR THE POT WHICH IS ANNOYING WHAT A SHOT 
WE MENTIONED THERE IS A NEW FOUR IN 
THE THEATRE AND THAT WILL HELP THE 
TABLES NEW FLOOR IT LOOKS GOOD 
WHAT A COMPETITIVE GRAEME DOTT IS 
COMPETITOR 
THAT WILL BE THE KEY TO HIS CHANCES 
HOW HARD HE COMPETES 
HE IS NOT BOTHERED ABOUT THE BLACK 
HE STARTED WITH A BREAK OF SIXTY FOUR HE 
FINISHED WITH AT TWENTY EIGHT BREAK 
IN THAT FRAME THERE WAS A LITTLE 
INCIDENT WHERE JOE PERRY WAS A 
LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY HE POTTED A RED 
AND CANNON ANOTHER RED AND HE HAD 
A CHANCE OF THE YELLOW AND HE HAD 
A COUPLE OF CHOICES ARE HE DECIDED 
TO TAKE THE DIFFICULT POT ON HE 
DID GET CLOSE TO IT BUT THAT COST 
HIM THE FRAME 
LOOKING AGAIN THE 
CUE BALL DID NOT RISE HE WAS MADE 
TO THINK ABOUT IT WITH IT THE SIXTY FOUR 
BREAK THAT FOLLOWED YOU TAKE ON A 
RASH ONE THEN IF YOUR OPPONENTS 
COURSE YOU SIT AND STEW OVER IT IN 
YOUR CHAIR 
BUT KWAME DOTT LOOKS ON 
GOOD FORM THE BEST POSSIBLE START 
FOR HIM GRAEME DOTT 
I AGREE THAT WILL MAKE A BIG 
DIFFERENCE WE KNOW HE HAS BEEN OUT 
OF FORM WE KNOW HE SAID WE ARE NOT 
TO EXPECT MUCH BUT I WOULD THINK 
HE WILL BE HERE GIVING IT 
EVERYTHING IN THE BIGGEST 
TOURNAMENT WE HAVE 
HE BREAKS OFF HE BREAKS OFF FROM 
THE OTHER SIDE A LOT OF PLAYERS 
BREAK OFF ON THE LEFT AS WE LOOK AT 
IT 
HE CAUGHT IT A BIT THIN SO HE HAS 
LEFT ONE RED POT BALL HERE 
I AM SURE GRAEME DOTT WOULD HAVE 
PUT PLENTY OF HARD WORK IN 
HE HAS NOT GOT AWAY WITH IT THIS 
TIME SO THIS IS THE BEST CHANCE 
THAT JOE PERRY HAS HAD 
EVERY FRAME OF SNOOKER YOU PLAY 
YOU ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE 
CHANCE IN AND AROUND THE BLACK SPOT 
AREA 
THAT DOES NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN SOME 
MATCHES YOU CAN PLAY THE BEST OF 
NINE AND YOU CANNOT REMEMBER 
GETTING IN AMONGST THE REDS AND 
BLACK 
IT ALSO DEPENDS HOW CREATED A 
PLAYER YOU ARE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE IN AMONGST THEM 
BECAUSE HE PLAYS SUCH KEY SHOTS 
EARLY 
A GOOD EFFORT IF HE HAD GIVEN IT A 
FRACTION MORE HE MIGHT HAVE DRIVEN 
THROUGH THE REDS EVEN MORE THAN 
THAT JUST A BIT EXTRA ON THIS 
WOULD HAVE BEEN O. K. BUT HE STUCK TO 
THE BOTTOM RED DO NOT THINK THERE IS ANYTHING ON THERE 
JUST A SAFETY IT MAKES A HUGE 
DIFFERENCE IF HE CAN BREAK THE REDS 
OPEN AND SCORE HEAVILY 
THERE IS NOT AN EASY SAFETY ON FOR 
HIM 
THE REFEREE HAVING A CLOSE LOOK TO 
SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING TOUCHING 
THAT WILL NOT HELP THE SITUATION 
HE CANNOT GET UP THE TABLE EVEN IF 
THEY ARE TOUCHING 
THAT HANDED THE ADVANTAGE TO JOE 
PERRY HE CAN NOW PLAY A STRAIGHT 
FORWARD SAFETY HE PLAYED A GOOD SAFETY SHOT THERE 
THAT IS A HARD SHOT TO PLAY THE 
DOUBLE KISS IS ALWAYS ON THOUGHT 
THE RED WAS A BIT CLOSE TO THE 
CUSHION FOR THAT SHOT 
HE PLAYED IT 
A LITTLE BIT QUICKLY DIDN'T HE HE 
NEEDED A VERY THIN CUT BUT HE HIT 
IT ON THE THICK SIDE 
THE SECOND CHANCE IN AND AROUND THE 
BLACK SPOT AREA 
HE HAS GOT A NICE WAY OF HITTING 
THE BALL A DELIBERATE PAUSE AT THE 
BACK WHICH SEEMS TO BE HIS FINAL 
CHEQUE WHERE HE MAKES SURE 
EVERYTHING IS O. K. HIS CUE ACTION 
HE IS NICE PLAYER IN AMONGST THEM HE MADE A ONE FOR FIVE BREAK HERE A 
FEW YEARS AGO UP AGAINST MARK 
WILLIAMS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE BREAK THAT SHOWED 
US EXACTLY WHAT HE COULD DO WHEN HE 
WAS IN AMONGST THEM 
THIS IS A GOOD CHANCE NOW HE HAS 
JUST GOT TO PLAY A GOOD SHOT HERE 
I DO NOT THINK HE PLAYED THAT I 
THINK HE IS ALL RIGHT 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A STRETCH TO 
GET TO THIS ONE 
IT'S A DELICATE SCREW SHOT THAT IS 
REQUIRED BUT HE CAN'T HOLD FOR THE 
BLACK 
HE IS UP FOR THE BLUE BUT HE'S VERY 
CLOSE TO THE CUSHION THAT HAS 
GIVEN HIMSELF QUITE A PROBLEM NOW 
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE STUNNED 
ROUND OF TWO CUSHIONS TO HOLD FOR 
THE BLACK THERE THERE'S A RED TO 
THE LEFT OF THE BUNCH OF REDS THERE THAT IS THE ONE HE HAS PLAYED FOR 
HE HAS TO PLAY A CANNON ON THE RED HE MISSED THAT BY A LONG WAY HE COULD HAVE PROBABLY GOT ON THE 
BLACK AND FOLLOWED THROUGH BUT HE 
JUST FLICK THE RED 
HE CERTAINLY SCATTERED THEM ONCE HE 
MISSED THE POT 
IN THE END JOE WAS RATHER 
FORTUNATE HE WILL FINISH ON A COLOUR OVERDONE IT 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE SHOTS WHERE YOU 
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HIT IT TOO 
THICK AND THEN HIT IT TOO THIN IN 
THE END IF HE PLAYS THIS RED NEXT 
TO THE BLUE HE IS GOING TO GO INTO 
THE BLUE 
IT'S ONE OF THE SHOTS IF HE GOES 
FOR IT HE JUST HAS TO HOPE FOR THE 
BEST 
THAT'S WHAT HE'S DONE HE TRIED TO 
SCREW AND THE BLUE THINKING ABOUT 
POSITION LOOK THE RED IS STILL ON 
THE TABLE AND GRAEME IS IN 
THE RED NEXT TO THE BLACK IS JUST A 
BIT OF A PROBLEM BUT THAT CAN BE 
RESOLVED IN A COUPLE OF SHOTS TIME 
THE BLACK IS AVAILABLE INTO THE 
RIGHT CORNER HE WILL BE ABLE TO 
GET ON TO THAT RED IN A FEW SHOTS 
TIME AND GETTING OUT OF THE WAY 
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HOLD FOR THAT 
RED THIS TIME AFTER POTTING THIS 
BLACK 
STILL O. K. IT WAS A BIT THINNER THAN 
I THOUGHT BUT HE DIDN'T EXPECT TO 
GO SO FAR UP THE TABLE 
AT LEAST HE'S GOT THE BLUE THERE 
AFTER HE POTS THIS RED HE'S GOT TO 
DO LITTLE OR NOTHING 
THE BLUE WILL BE A BIT AWKWARD NEXT 
TO THE PINK THERE HE IS GOING TO 
GET THIS RED OUT OF THE WAY AND THE 
BLACK WILL BE IN THE CLEAR FOR BOTH 
IT WOULD BE A TERRIFIC FRAME TO 
PINCH BECAUSE JOE PERRY WAS IN THE 
DRIVING SEAT 
HE HAS MISJUDGED THAT HE'S GOT TO 
THE RED TO THE LEFT CENTRE BUT I 
THINK YOU MUST HAVE PLAYED ON THE 
ONE HE WAS CLOSEST TO HE MUST HAVE 
PLAYED 
HE HAS GOT THAT RED TO THE CENTRE 
AS DENNIS POINTED OUT THE BLUE AND 
THE PINK ARE NOT TIED UP BUT THEY 
ARE NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD TO THE 
CENTRE POCKET GOOD RECOVERY CONSIDERING 
HE HAS TO AVOID THE GREEN TO MAKE 
SURE HE GETS BACK OF THE TABLE HE 
HAS DONE THAT BACK UP THE TABLE 
IT WAS NICE TO BRING THE RED INTO 
PLAY BUT I THINK HE'S GOT A BIT OF 
A PROBLEM NOW 
WELL HE COULD PLAY 
THE RED THAT HE PLAYED ON THE LAST 
TIME THAT HE FINISHED CLOSE TO 
THAT WILL POT BUT IT'S A BIG SHOT 
TO TAKE ON HE'S LOOKING AT THE ONE 
BELOW WHAT THAT IS NEARER TO THE 
POCKET IT'S A SLIGHTLY EASIER POT 
IF YOU CAN SEE IT 
I THINK HE WILL TAKE THE MORE 
DIFFICULT ONE 
HE PLAYED IT STRANGELY HE DIDN'T 
REALLY PLAY IT LIKE IT WAS FINE 
BALL 
A FRAME OF BAULK 
HE PUT 
EVERYTHING INTO THE POT AND FORGOT 
ABOUT THE CUE BALL 
THIS IS A TRICKY ONE FOR JOE PERRY 
YOU'VE GOT TO CUE THESE SO WELL 
WHEN YOU ARE NEAR THE CUSHION 
VERY GOOD CUEING HE IS ON THE PINK 
HE MAY BE ON THE BLACK DON'T 
THINK THE BLACK GOES BUT THE PINK 
IS AVAILABLE 
THIS COULD GIVE JOE HIS SECOND 
FRAME 
GONE A BIT TOO FAR REALLY IT'S O. K. 
BUT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE 
BEEN RIGHT BEHIND THIS RED THINGS 
ARE TRICKIER FROM WHERE HE IS NOW 
HE PLAYED A GOOD SHOT THERE HE HAS 
DONE IT IN AND IS NOW PERFECT ON 
THE BLUE HE HAS A TERRIFIC CHANCE 
OF CLOSING OF THE FRAME 
OUT THE FRAME RED AND A COLOUR 
IS ALL HE NEEDS HE CAME INTO THIS 
MATCH AS FAVOURITE FOR MANY REASONS 
HE NEEDED TO GET THE FRAME ON THE 
BOARD AND THIS WILL JUST ABOUT 
GUARANTEE THAT IT FINISHES ON IT 
JOE PERRY HAS LEVELLED EVERYTHING 
UP 
WE WILL QUICKLY GIVE YOU THE NEWS 
FROM THE SECOND QUARTER FINAL IN 
OUR JUNIOR POT BLACK THIS IS SAM 
CRAIGIE FROM NEWCASTLE FOURTEEN YEARS 
OLD UNDER FOURTEEN ENGLISH CHAMPION HE 
IS UP AGAINST THIS FELLOW IN THE 
GREEN JACKET THIS IS THE IRISH 
UNDER SIXTEENS CHAMPION THE STORY 
OF THEIR FRAME WELL IT WAS 
PRETTY CLOSE IN THE EARLY STAGES 
BUT SOME ARE LET THINGS GET AWAY 
FROM HIM HE WENT IN OFF HERE TO 
CONFIRM THE WIN FOR JASON SEVENTY TWO TO THIRTY TWO 
IT'S THE IRISH WINNER GOES THROUGH 
TO THE SEMI FINAL THAT THE 
SITUATION NOW A THIRD QUARTER FINAL 
IS JUST ABOUT TO GET UNDER WAY 
ISN'T THAT BRILLIANT TO SEE THOSE 
YOUNGSTERS IN THERE KNOCKING BALLS 
IN AND PLAY IN SAFETY SHOTS THERE 
IS A YOUNG GIRL REFEREE WITH HER 
PLAYS AROUND FANTASTIC MEANWHILE 
BACK IN THE THEATRE OF DREAMS IT'S 
JOE PERRY WHO WILL BREAK OFF 
A BIT CLOSE TO THE BLUE THERE 
THAT'S A BIT TOO THIN AS WELL HE 
MAY HAVE LEFT A POSSIBLE POT ON 
THAT'S POOR SHOT FROM GRAEME DOTT 
WHO IS USUALLY PRETTY SOLID IN THE 
TACTICAL SIDE OF THE GAME 
GOOD SHOT HE DIDN'T LOSE THE CUE 
BALL TO THE SIDE CUSHION THERE 
EITHER 
ON THIS BLACK HE HAS GOT AN ANGLE 
BUT THE REDS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
PACK ARE IN THE WAY OF REALLY 
GETTING INTO THEM 
HE HAS TAKEN A CHANCE THE BLACK 
HAS GONE ON THE FLOOR THAT'S NOT 
THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED 
THIS WEEK 
GRAEME DOTT HAS COME 
FORWARD TO FISH IT OUT FROM UNDER 
THE TABLE YES IT'S HAPPENED A FEW 
TIMES L. DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG 
WITH THAT CORNER POCKET THEY 
SHOULD HAVE A LOOK AT THAT IT 
HAPPENS IN CLUB TABLES A LOT OF 
THAT BECAUSE THE POCKETS ARE WARNED 
WARNED 
YES YOU'D SEE A BALL FLYING ALONG 
THE FLOOR AT THE BILLIARD HALL 
COVERED IN FLUFF AND EVERYTHING 
HE IS NOT QUITE ON THE BLUE THAT 
WILL PROBABLY BE HIS NEXT COLOUR IF 
HE PLAYS ONE ONE OF THOSE SHOTS 
YOU CAN'T OVER SCREW YOU MUST GET 
OUT OF THE PACK OF REDS IF YOU CAN 
HE COULD KNOCK THE BLUE IN HE IS GOING TO TAKE IT ON TOP LEFT IS HE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS HE DID LOOK AT THE BLUE AND HE WAS 
SHAPING UP TO PLAY IT BUT HE HAS 
DECIDED TO WAIT 
GRAEME TAPS THE TABLE REALISING HE 
CAN SEE THE RED BUT HE IS IN 
TROUBLE HE IS PLAYING LIKE HE IS 
SNOOKERED HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL GOOD SHOT 
A PRETTY GOOD RETURN FROM GRAEME 
DOTT HAS HE BLOCKED THE PATH OFF 
DOWN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE MAYBE HE 
CAN JUST GET PAST THE BROWN TO 
SNICK THE REDS 
HE ALMOST GOT IN BEHIND THE BROWN 
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT THAT IS 
WHAT HE PLAYED WHEN HE PLAYED TO 
THE CUSHION BUT AS IT HAPPENS 
GRAEME CAN GET TO THE RED TO PLAY 
SAFE 
THAT HAS BLOCKED THE PATH OFF DOWN 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE 
WHAT IS JOE FACED WITH ON THE LEFT 
SIDE THERE IS NOT MUCH AVAILABLE 
THERE THAT IS VERY TIGHT IT IS VERY TIGHT CLOSE 
GIFTED AND VERY TIGHT INDEED IT 
DID LOOK 
A GOOD POT BUT I AM LOOKING AT THE 
YELLOW HE IS FACED WITH HE IS THE 
POT AGAIN CUEING FROM THE CUSHION 
HE IS GOING TO TRY TO HIDE BEHIND 
THE YELLOW HE HAS DONE WELL TO 
COVER THEM BECAUSE THE RED IS QUITE 
WELL SPREAD HE HAS GOT THE SNOOKER 
IF THE BLACK IS BLOCKING THE TOP 
POCKET HE CAN COME OFF A COUPLE OF 
CUSHIONS AND NESTLE INTO THE REDS 
AND 
I THINK HE COULD BE O. K. I THINK THE BLACK IS BLOCKING THE POCKET IF HE COMES THAT WILL DO NICELY 
I'M JUST LOOKING I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER GRAEME CAN GET UP NEAR THE 
GREEN L. DON'T THINK SO 
I THOUGHT THE RED NEXT TO THE CUE 
BALL HE MIGHT HAVE TO BEEN ABLE TO 
GLANCE OFF THAT BUT IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO GET BEHIND THE GREEN 
ANYWAY IF THAT SHOT IS ON HE WOULD 
PROBABLY CANNON THE GREEN AND LEAVE 
A STRAIGHT FORWARD SAFETY 
THERE WAS NEVER ENOUGH ROOM TO GET 
BEHIND THAT BE HIS FAMILY SAYS 
IT IS FAIRLY SAFE 
WE SAW JONAH CUT A POSSIBLE PLANT 
BUT I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE ON 
JOE SWAIL LOOK AT 
IT IS NEVER NICE PLAYING FROM THE 
JAWS OF POCKET THAT IS WHAT 
GRAEME IS FACED WITH HERE HE WILL 
TAKE LOOK AT THE SAME TWO REDS 
BUT JOE PERRY LOOKED AT THEM L. DON'T KNOW IF THE PLANT IS ON 
HE IS DOUBLE CHECKING THE PLANT 
THERE IS A RED THAT WILL PULL OUT 
WE WILL SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE THE 
PLANT IS AIMING TO TO THE LEFT OF 
THE POCKET BUT WITH THE REDS 
TOUCHING IT COULD BE MADE 
NOT A BAD KISS ON THE BLUE BUT IF 
HE IS DEAD STRAIGHT WE ARE GOING 
TO SEE WHAT SORT OF CUE POWER JOE 
PERRY HAS BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE TO 
SCREW BACK PAST THE BLUE SPOT AREA 
WELL PLAYED HE DIDN'T PLAN TO GET 
IN AROUND THE BACK OF THE GREEN HE 
DIDN'T HIT IT AS INTENDED BUT I I DON'T THINK HE DID PLAY IT L. WONDER IF THE PLANT IS LIKABLE NOW MAKEABLE 
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER ABOUT THE 
PLANT HE WILL GO INTO THE RIGHT 
CORNER AND THERE ARE THREE OTHER 
EASY REDS THERE ARE PROBABLY FIVE 
EASY REDS 
A GOOD CHANCE NOW EVEN THOUGH THE 
BLACK IS OUT OF COMMISSION PERFECT 
FOR KNOCKING THE PINK IN WITH EACH 
OF THE REDS 
HE HAS JUDGED THAT WELL IT IS A 
GOOD SHOT THOSE SCREW SHOTS CAN GO 
WRONG WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING DIRECTLY 
BACK ON TO A SINGLE COLOUR 
JOE HAS STARTED TO SETTLE IN THE 
FIRST FRAME HE LOOKED EDGY 
A BIT OF THE BUILD UP TO THIS MATCH 
GIVING GRAEME'S PROBLEMS IT DID 
MAKE A JOKE A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT HE 
IS IN THE FLOW NOW 
JOE PERRY JOE PERRY IS RANKED NUMBER EIGHTEEN AT 
THE MOMENT BUT PROVISIONALLY HE IS 
HEADING UP THE RANKINGS HE IS FOURTEEN 
AND A GOOD RUN HERE WOULD LIFT HIM 
FURTHER UP THE RANKINGS 
DOUBLE POINTS AT THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
STRAIGHT ON THE PINK WOULD HAVE 
BEEN MUCH EASIER BUT HE HAS GOT A 
SLIGHT ANGLE 
INSTEAD OF LEAVING A 
STRAIGHTFORWARD RED TO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET HE HAD TO LEAVE SLIGHTLY LONGER POT 
SIXTY POINTS THE DIFFERENCE STILL A 
POSSIBLE FIFTY NINE ON THE TABLE YOU WOULD 
THINK IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO GIVE 
HIM THE FRAME BUT THIS WAS A 
STRAIGHTFORWARD POT JUST ONE 
SNOOKER REQUIRED 
IF THIS RED GOES ALONG THE CUSHION 
IT WILL BE END OF FRAME GRAEME 
DOTT WILL STAY IN HIS SEAT 
YES HE SIGNALS TO THE REFEREE THAT 
HE HAS HAD ENOUGH A BREAK OF FORTY SEVEN 
PAVED THE WAY FOR JOE PERRY AND HE 
GOES INTO THE LEAD 
SO FAR IT IS GOING 
JOE PERRY'S WAY WHEN YOU THINK 
ABOUT HOW HE QUALIFIED FOR THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE RECKONS THAT FINAL 
QUALIFYING MATCH WHICH WAS AFTER 
ALL HERE IN SHEFFIELD WAS THE BEST 
COMEBACK OF HIS CAREER I THINK 
AGAINST A GUY CALLED JOHN PARROTT 
I'M NOT SURE L. WONDER HOW YOU VIEW DID 
IT IS TRICKY BECAUSE WHEN A DID PLAYER SAYS HE HAS HAD A GREAT 
COMEBACK THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO 
THE STORY THE OTHER PERSON CAN 
THINK THEY THREW IT AWAY LAST 
NIGHT COLOUR PEOPLE SAID I HAD A 
GREAT COMEBACK BUT I THREW IT AWAY 
AT THE END L. DON'T KNOW HOW YOU 
SAW THAT MATCH AGAINST JOE PERRY I I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT 
IF YOU 
WON YOUR MATCH THERE AND PLAYED 
GRAEME DOTT IN THE FIRST ROUND AND 
PLAYED HINT AND I HAD NOT THAT 
BALL IN THE OTHER NIGHT WE WOULD 
BE MEETING IN THE LAST SIXTEEN AND ONE 
OF US 
I AM GOING TO CALL A HALT 
TO THIS THIS IS FANTASY 
WE WERE 
ONE BALL AWAY FROM WINNING THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT CHAMPIONSHIP WE CALL THE CRUCIBLE 
THEATRE OF DREAMS THE BOYS ARE 
STILL IN THEIR OWN LITTLE DREAM 
WORLD JOHN PARROTT WAS VERY 
DEFENSIVE WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED 
BUT WHAT A BATTLE FROM STEVE DAVIS 
LAST NIGHT IT WAS A TERRIFIC 
COMEBACK THOSE TWO BOYS IN THE 
STUDIO ARE STILL CAPABLE OF WINNING 
MATCHES 
ESPECIALLY LAST YEAR WHEN THEY 
PLAYED EACH OTHER SUPPOSE ONE OF THEM WAS GOING TO WIN THEY KNOW I DON'T MEAN THAT 
HE WAS FRIGHTENED OF HITTING IT 
HALF BALL AND GOING INTO THE POCKET 
OR THE RIGHT HAND SIDE CUSHION 
IT'S THE KIND OF SHOT WHERE YOU 
PLAY REALLY THIN I'M SURE HE WILL 
PLAY IT BETTER THIS TIME 
THIS IS WORSE THAN BEING IN A 
SNOOKER I THINK CUEING RIGHT OVER 
THE TOP OF THE BROWN YOU DO WELL 
TO GET THIN EDGE ON THIS THERE 
YOU GO THAT THE PROBLEMS WITH 
SHOTS LIKE THAT 
I OFTEN THING WHEN YOU MISS THE 
BALL PRIZE AND THE REFEREE WARNED 
TO SAY YOU MISSED OF FRAME SO YOU 
DID THAT 
BE BE IN TROUBLE YOU'D 
BE IN TROUBLE 
HE MAY HAVE A SAFETY SHOT HERE TO 
GET BEHIND THE YELLOW IT'S A GOOD EFFORT 
HE HAD A BIT OF A GAP TO FIND THERE 
BUT HE DID WELL HE HAS LEFT 
POSSIBLE POT TO THE LEFT CORNER BUT 
THE CUE BALL WILL BE GOING TOWARDS 
THE LITTLE BUNCH OF REDS 
IF HE FULLY COMMIT TO THIS POT 
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE WHITE 
THERE IS A BIT OF A GAP HE MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO GET THROUGH 
IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
TO GET THE WHITE AROUND THE BACK OF 
THE BLACK THERE THE PINK MAYBE 
POTABLE L. THINK HE IS HONEST 
BRITISH PINK BECAUSE HE IS LOOKING 
TO SEE IF THE PINK SPOT IS OCCUPIED 
IF IT IS HE COULD PUT IT ON THE 
BLACK SPOT 
HE LIFTED ITS STAKE UP FROM THE 
SHOT AND YOU KNEW THAT HE WAS MILES 
AWAY 
DON'T REALLY ISSUES ASSOCIATE 
GRAEME DOTT OF HAVING CUE POWER BUT 
THAT WAS A GOOD EFFORT HE REALLY 
GOT INTO THAT ONE ALMOST TOO MUCH 
CAME A LOT MORE TO THE LEFT OF THE 
PACK HERE IT IS AGAIN MAYBE GOT A BIT TOO MUCH SCREW ON 
THEY MAY NOT BE A WAY BACK DOWN THE 
TABLE HE IS VERY CLOSE TO THE 
YELLOW CAN ONLY SEE THE REDS THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THE TABLE JUST LOOK 
TO SEE IF HE COULD POSSIBLY TAKE A 
POT ON 
THAT WAS TOUGH HE DID HIT YOU THE 
RED BUT I THINK HE'S BEEN 
FORTUNATE THERE THAT RED HAS COME 
BACK AND MOVED THE ONE THAT HE 
WOULD HAVE LEFT 
THREE QUICK FRAMES FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN 
MINUTES 
YOU CAN SEE THE CHALK MARKS ALL 
OVER THE TABLE AT THE 
I THINK THEY HAVE TRIED TO COME UP 
WITH TIP THERE YOU NEVER NEED TO 
TALK BUT IT NEVER REALLY WORKED 
CHALK 
I THINK THE CUE BALL FINISHING ON 
THE CUSHION DOWN HE WOULD BE THE 
BEST WAY L. WONDER IF HE DID GO FOR 
THAT OR NOT I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY 
SURE 
I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN HE 
PLAYED THIS HE WAS LOOKING AT 
THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT SHOTS 
THAT WAS THE BEST SHOT OF THIS 
MATCH SO FAR 
THEY DON'T CALL HIM THE POCKET 
DYNAMO FOR NOTHING 
THAT RED REMINDED ME OF HOW HE 
PLAYED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
HE DIDN'T MAKE MANY BIG BREAKS A 
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BUT THERE WAS 
GREAT SNOOKER ALONG THE WAY 
YOU MENTIONED BIG BREAKS THERE 
GRAEME HAS MADE SEVENTY SEVEN CENTURIES SINCE 
TURNING PRO TURNED PRO IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
BUT HE IS ONE OF THE PLAYERS THAT 
HAS MADE A MAXIMUM BREAK IN 
TOURNAMENT PLAY IN THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE BRITISH 
OPEN 
YELLOW AND BROWN ARE A GREAT TARGET 
NOW NOT EASY TO GET 
HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH THIS HE HAS 
BEEN VERY LUCKY INDEED 
HE HIT THIS TOO THICK CAN GRAEME 
DOTT FORCE THIS IN AND GET TOWARDS 
THE BLACK 
WELL PLAYED AND IF HE IS STRAIGHT 
ON THE BLACK HE JUST LEAVES THE 
WHITE WHERE THE BLACK IS AND 
THERE'S COUPLE OF REDS AVAILABLE 
INTO THE LEFT CORNER THIS IS A 
GOOD CHANCE 
THE MID SESSION INTERVAL COMING UP 
AFTER THIS FRAME 
GRAEME COULD MAYBE SCREW BACK THREE 
OR FOUR INCHES TO PLAY ON THE RED 
INTO THE OPPOSITE CORNER THE 
SECOND ONE OF THE TWO IN THE LINE 
THAT WOULD FREE THE OTHER ONE UP 
YEAH IF HE CAN SCREW BACK TO WHERE 
THAT OTHER WHITE BALL IS HE COULD 
POT THAT AS YOU MENTIONED HE IS 
GOING FOR THE PINK 
HE PLAYED THE CANNON ON THE RED TO 
THE RIGHT OF THE PINK AND HE HAS 
MISSED IT IT WAS NOT A GREAT SHOT 
REALLY IT HAS FORCED HIM TO PLAY 
THE LONG BLUE THAT IS ALL VERY 
WELL BUT HE KNOWS HE SHOULD BE 
PLAYING ANY EASIER SHOT AN 
EASIER SHOT 
HE DID NOT POT THAT CLEANLY AND 
THAT IS WHY HE DID NOT GET WHERE HE 
INTENDED 
ONCE YOU THE RUN SLIGHTLY INTENDED OUT OF POSITION IT SEEMS TO 
SNOWBALL HE OVER SCREWED THAT A 
BIG SIGH THERE HE KNOWS THAT THAT 
WAS A GREAT CHANCE TO GO ON AND 
LEVEL AT TWO TO TWO HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT 
FOR ANOTHER CHANCE NOW 
THAT IS ABOUT THE BEST HE COULD DO 
THERE HE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
HE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A FREE SHOT TO 
JOE L. THINK HE WILL AVOID THE CANNON ON THE BLACK 
BID HAS PLAYED THE OLD SHOCK SHOT 
AGAIN THE GREAT WHITE HE HAS 
PLAYED THE SECOND PART OF THE SHOT 
WORKING OUT WELL 
I LIKE THAT THE GREAT WHITE HE 
COULD HAVE NAMED IT AFTER GREG 
NORMAN HE HAS KNOWN HE IS KNOWN 
AS THE GREAT WHITE HE USED TO PLAY 
SNOOKER WHEN HE WAS ON THE 
EUROPEAN TOUR HE USED TO KNOW JOHN 
SPENCER QUITE WELL AND HE PLAYED 
LOVELY SNOOKER AS A LOT OF THE 
GOLFERS DO 
THAT IS A MISTAKE THIS IS THE 
CHANCE HE IS WAITING FOR TO GET TO 
THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
GRAEME DOTT WITH A SHORT PUNCHY 
CUE ACTION HE DOES NOT BRING HIS 
CUE BACK THAT FAR BUT HE REALLY 
PUSHES THROUGH QUITE SIMPLE WAY 
OF HITTING THE BALL BUT THAT IS 
THEY PUT BAD THING THAT IS NEVER A BAD THING 
JUST GOING BACK TO THE GULF IT IS 
THE SAME THING IT IS ALL ABOUT THE 
FOLLOW THROUGH THAT IS THE SECRET 
YES WITH HIS CUE ACTION THE FACT 
HE DOES NOT BRING THE CUE BACK VERY 
FAR YOU KNOW HE HAS GOT TO BE 
REALLY COMMITTED WITH THE FOLLOW 
THROUGH 
HIS MIND IS ALMOST MADE UP IT IS 
THE PLAYERS WE DID NOT BACK SWINGS 
THAT SOMETIMES STRUGGLE MARK 
SELBY'S OLD CUE ACTION WAS SO LONG 
HE FOUND THE HE FOUND IT 
DIFFICULT 
HE HAS PLAYED ON A RED TO THE RIGHT 
CENTRE FRAME BALL 
YOU SAW THE GRIP THERE NICE AND 
RELAXED 
HE CAN COMPLETE THE RELAXED NOW HE 
WILL BE GETTING READY FOR HIS MID 
SESSION INTERVAL CUP OF TEA HE 
CAN COMPLETE YOU RELAX NOW COMPLETELY RELAX 
IT IS A FAIR ENOUGH SCORELINE TWO TO TWO 
AFTER WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IT HAS NOT 
BEEN VINTAGE BUT IT HAS BEEN A 
DECENT GAME AM SURE THIS WILL BE 
A CLOSE MATCH L. ALWAYS THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE DESPITE GRAEME DOTT'S 
PROBLEMS WITH DEPRESSION AND THE 
FACT THAT HE WAS THINKING OF NOT 
PLAYING HE FELT THIS WOULD BE A 
TOUGH MATCH THE BOOK MAKERS 
DECIDED JOE PERRY WAS THE FAVOURITE 
HE LOOKS O. K. TO ME GRAEME DOTT IT IT IS THE BEST POSSIBLE THERAPY FOR 
HIM OUT HERE IN THE CRUCIBLE 
THEATRE WHERE HE WON THE WORLD 
TITLE TWO YEARS AGO MUCH BETTER 
DOING THAT THAN SITTING AT HOME 
AND EVERY CREDIT TO HIM HE HAS 
STARTED VERY WELL HERE 
HE MISSED THAT ONE BUT IT WILL NOT 
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE A BREAK OF FIFTY SIX 
AND THE MID SESSION INTERVAL HE 
DID TO TWO TO TWO 
WHAT ARE YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF GRAEME 
DOTT'S FORM 
AND HE LOOKS ISN'T 
ENOUGH BUT INTERESTINGLY THE 
PROBLEMS MAY COME FOR JOE PERRY 
HE LOOKS DECENT ENOUGH HE HAD THE 
WORRY BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT STARTED 
KNOWING WHETHER HE HAD A MATCH 
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE IS PLAYING 
AGAINST SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN 
SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION JOE 
PERRY IS COMING INTO THE GAME 
WONDERING WHAT HE WILL COME UP 
AGAINST AND THAT CAN BE OFF 
PUTTING GRAEME DOTT COMES OUT 
PLAYING PRETTY DECENTLY STRANGE 
EMOTIONS FOR BOTH PLAYERS GRAEME GRAEME DOTT'S FORM HAS SUFFERED GREATLY 
HE HAS GONE FIFTEEN MATCHES THE LONGEST 
SPELL OF HIS CAREER WITHOUT A WIN 
AND HIS AMBITION WAS NOT TO WIN THE 
WORLD TITLE BUT SIMPLY TO COME OUT 
IN GOOD HEALTH COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT FOCUS FOR HIM THIS YEAR 
YES AND THAT CAN MAKE HIM VERY 
DANGEROUS OPPONENT BECAUSE HE IS 
COMING HERE TO ENJOY HIMSELF AND 
HE CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS HE CAN 
RELAX PLAYED LIKE HE IS IN THE 
CLUB IN ESSENCE THAT IS WHAT 
EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO DO TAKE 
THEIR PRACTICE FORM ON TO THE MATCH 
TABLE AND IF HE HAS THAT RELAXED 
ATTITUDE THE COULD BE DANGEROUS 
INITIALLY IN THE FIRST FRAME WE 
SAW JOE PERRY TAKE ON RISKY 
YELLOW INTO THE MIDDLE POCKET AND 
YOU ARE THINKING IF YOU WERE IN A 
SITUATION WHERE YOU WERE PLAYING 
PLAYER HE MACRO WAS NOT COMPLETELY 
MENTALLY ON THE BALL WOULD YOU 
WANT TO PLAY AGGRESSIVE ATTACKING 
SNOOKER HE PERHAPS WENT OUT 
THINKING HE HAD AN EASIER MATCH 
EVEN IF ONE PER CENT OF HE IS DIFFERENT IT 
IS A PROBLEM 
THEY WILL ENJOY A 
HALF TIME CUP OF TEA WE WILL ENJOY 
SOME MORE ACTION FROM THE THIRD OF 
THE QUARTER FINALS IN THE JUNIOR 
POT BLACK SERIES 
HERE IS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD FROM NEWBURY 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE NORTHERN 
IRELAND UNDER SIXTEEN CHAMPION HE IS UP 
AGAINST A FELLOW WHO HAS WON A 
TOURNAMENT TO BE HERE HE IS FROM 
SHEFFIELD 
HERE HE IS HE IS FIFTEEN FROM 
SHEFFIELD AND HE HAD TO WIN A 
TOURNAMENT AT THE WORLD SNOOKER 
ACADEMY TO BE HERE THE IRISHMAN 
MISSED EARLY ON THEY BOTH HAD A 
COUPLE OF CHANCES AT IT 
IN THE END IT WAS THE SHEFFIELD 
EL HADJI DIOUF COULD KEEP HIS 
COMPOSURE AND A SLOT THIS ONE HOME 
HE GOES THROUGH TO THE SEMI FINALS 
THE SHEFFIELD PLAYER 
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU TAKE TWO A 
FORMER WORLD CHAMPIONS DOWN TO A 
TRAIN STATION AND YOU BRING THEM 
SOME WORLD WEARY TRAVELLERS SET UP 
A HUGE SNOOKER TABLE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE TICKET LOUNGE AND TRY AND DO 
SOME COACHING DO YOU HAVE GOT A 
RECIPE FOR A COACHING CLINIC AND A 
COUPLE OF LAUGHS AS WELL 
WHAT IS YOUR NAME 
UP CAP 
I DO A 
SNOOKER PLAYER OR A POOR PLAYER A A ABLE PLAYER 
ANY GOOD L. L. AM 
I AM ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD BUT THE TABLES 
ARE QUITE BIG FOR ME 
WHAT IS YOUR 
QUESTION 
HOW CAN I CHANGE MY QUESTION STANCE SO I GET BETTER SHOTS 
GO ON 
THEN SHAUN MURPHY 
STANDING HIS 
VERY INDIVIDUAL WHY DO RIGHT 
HANDED YES 
ARGUE RIGHT HANDED HANDED YES LEAD WITH YOUR RIGHT FOOT GET IN A 
GOOD POSITION THEN GET YOUR LEFT 
FOOT AHEAD OF YOUR RIGHT FOOT IN 
THE OLD DAYS THEY USED TO BE 
SIDEARM LIKE AN OLD BOXER BUT NOW 
THE MODERN DAY PLAYERS TEND TO 
STAND A LOT MORE SQUARE TO THEIR 
SHOTS 
BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE 
I HOPE I 
GET THIS RIGHT THE GENERAL IDEA 
YOU GET YOUR RIGHT FOOT IN LINE 
WITH THE SHOT AND SOME OF THE 
WEIGHT GOING FORWARD ON YOUR LEFT 
CHART THAT LEFT BUT THAT GIVES 
YOU A STABLE BASE TO HIT THE SHOTS 
FROM 
WALK INTO A SHOT AS YOU WOULD FROM WHAT WHAT HE DOES WATCH WHAT HE 
DOES THE LEFT FOOT GOES FORWARD 
THE TILES ON THE FLOOR OF VERY GOOD 
YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE ANGLE HAVE A WALK INTO THE SHOT 
IT IS WHICHEVER FEELS COMFORTABLE 
REALLY 
THE OLD WELL USED TO BE THAT IF 
YOU PUT YOUR HAND DOWN ON THE TABLE 
AND YOU COULD LIFTED UP YOU WERE 
TOO FAR AWAY GET DOWN TO THE SHOT 
AND SEE HOW YOU FEEL AND WE WILL 
SEE IF YOU FALL OVER OR NOT THAT THAT IS NOT BAD SPOT ON 
OH MY GOODNESS I HAVE GOT A POT 
THERE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
POT THERE THERE 
FIRST CLASS COACHING TIPS FROM THE 
BOYS THERE WILL BE END OF THE ONE 
TO BORROW WE WILL CONCENTRATE ON 
MATCH FEATURING A FELLOW WHO ONCE 
WORLD SNOOKER MARK WILLIAMS TWICE 
THE BLOOD CHAMPION HERE IT WAS 
ONLY EIGHT FEW YEARS AGO THAT HE 
WILL BE RESET ONLY FEW YEARS 
LATER THIS SEASON HE FOUND HIMSELF 
BACK OUT TO BE WORLD NO FORTY IN THE 
PROVISIONAL RANKINGS AND HE WAS 
EVEN TALKING ABOUT THROWING IN HIS 
CHANCES ALTOGETHER AND PERHAPS 
CONTEMPLATING EARLY RETIREMENT 
THINGS HAVE CHANGED ON THAT SCORE 
BUT HE IS A COMPLEX CHARACTER 
IT IS INTERESTING WRITING BECAUSE 
IT HAS GOT VERY STRONG VERTICAL 
EMPHASIS WHICH MEANS THIS IS A 
VERY GOAL ORIENTATED MAN THE 
SIGNATURE IT MATCHES THE TEXT BUT 
NOT EXACTLY IT IS BIGGER AND 
SLIGHTLY MORE LOOPY BUT IT IS 
RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE 
THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER THAT 
INDICATES THAT HIS ROLE IS TO HAVE 
ACTION WITH OTHER PEOPLE HE IS NOT 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CONFIDENT IN WHO HE IS EVEN 
THOUGH HE COMES ACROSS AS BEING SO 
IT HAS QUITE BUSINESSLIKE PERSONAL 
PRONOUNS AND YET SOME WHICH ARE 
NOT HE STRAIGHT DOWN SPOKE 
HERE WITH THE HEAD AND THE TAIL HE 
IS SHOWING MUCH MORE BUSINESSLIKE 
APPROACH THE INTERESTING THING IS 
THAT WE HAVE HERE SLIGHT CONTRAST 
THE HAS NOT GOT THE DOWN STROKE OFF 
THE R. I. A. A. OF I FITTING DOWN TO THE 
LOWER STROKE THAT MEANS THAT 
SOMETIMES HIS IDEAS ARE NOT ALWAYS 
PUT INTO PRACTICE HE DOES NEED TO 
HAVE GOAL AND DEADLINE IF HE 
IS LEFT WITH TOO MANY CHOICES HE 
FIND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE CHOICE 
HE NEEDS TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED 
POCKETS TO GO TO BECAUSE OTHERWISE 
HE WILL FLOAT AROUND DO A BIT OF 
THIS AND BIT OF THAT AND THOUGH 
HE MIGHT BE AMBITIOUS HE CAN'T 
SEEM TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER SO HE 
DOES THE TO HAVE SOMETHING WHICH 
WILL CHANNEL HIS ENERGY AND GIVE 
HIM SOMETHING THAT IS WORTH 
ACHIEVING BUT HE HAS GOT HIS SENSE 
OF HUMOUR FORTUNATELY SOME OF THE 
LIGHTISH BREAKS THAT ARE DONE IN 
THE WRITING SHOWED THE LIGHTER 
TOUCH THAT HE WILL ALLOW HIMSELF 
THAT TWO CRACKER JOKE AND LIGHTEN 
THE ATMOSPHERE IF THINGS ARE NOT GO 
INTO WELL IT DEPENDS ON HIS SENSE 
OF SECURITY IF HE THINKS HE IS O. K. 
HE IS WITH FRIENDS AND HE HAS MADE 
A MISTAKE BUT IT IS NO BIG DEAL HE 
CAN COPE QUITE WELL BUT HE 
FEEL THE PRESSURE WHEN SITUATIONS 
BECOME VERY FRAUD THEREFORE THAT 
WILL UPSET HIM AT THAT POINT IF HE 
DOES GO WRONG 
LAST NIGHT MARK 
DIDN'T HANG AROUND AGAINST MARK 
DAVIS WHO HAD WAITED SEVEN YEARS 
FOR ANOTHER CHANCE TO APPEAR AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THIS IS NOT WHAT HE HAD 
IMAGINED I AM SURE AS WILLIAMS 
GOT FOUR FRAMES IN A ROW BEFORE 
DAVIES GOT THE LAST IN THIS SESSION 
TWO MORE REQUIRED IN THIS SESSION 
FOR WILLIAMS WE PICK THEM UP IN 
FRAME TEN DAVIS IS FIFTY TWO TO TEN AHEAD 
IT IS UNUSUAL TO SEE PROFESSIONALS 
PLAYED DOUBLES IT COULD BE A FRAME 
WINNER THAT IS WHY HE PLAYED IT 
PLAY 
HE ONLY NEEDS THE RED THAT IS WHY 
HE WAS NOT WORRIED ABOUT LEAVING IT 
OH DEAR I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW FAR HE 
MISSED THAT BY IT REALLY MOVED ON 
THE SHOT 
THE FACT THAT HE IS THIRTY TWO BEHIND HE 
NEEDS TO MAKE SURE OF PINK OR BLUE 
HE HAS CHOSEN NOT TO PLAY FOR THE 
POT 
FOUL 
HE DIDN'T HIT THE 
SAFETY WELL HE PROBABLY THINKS HE 
WAS A LITTLE UNLUCKY TO KNOCK THE 
PINK IN AND LEAVE MARK WILLIAMS 
WITH CHANCE BUT HE HAS GOT TO 
LOOK BACK AT THE RED THAT HE MISSED 
A FEW SHOTS TO GO NOT THE BEST WE 
HAVE SEEN FROM MARK WILLIAMS HE IS 
STRUGGLING IN THIS FIRST FRAME 
BECAUSE OF THE FOUL ON THE PINK HE 
DID NOT HAVE TO TAKE THE BLACK ON FOUL AND A MISS 
THAT IS TWO DOES THEY COULD BE A 
FEW POINTS HERE BECAUSE THERE IS 
NO VALUE IN PLAYING THAT SLOW RUN 
UP TO THE YELLOW 
FROM BEING THIRTY FOUR IN FRONT ALL OF A 
IS NOW ONLY SEVENTEEN IN FRONT 
THE FACT THAT HE HAS MOVED THE 
BLOW OUT HE WOULD HAVE IT REPLACED 
BUT HE WOULD HAVE IT REPLACED NOW 
WON'T SAYING THAT HE CAN'T GET 
ONTO THE GREEN NICELY 
MARK DAVIS WILL BE KICKING HIMSELF 
FOR MISSING THAT LAST RED ALONG THE 
CUSHION HE ONLY HAD TO DROP IT IN 
AND HE WAS SAFE 
MARK WILLIAMS HAS NEVER PLAYED THIS 
BADLY IN FRAME BEFORE AND WON IT THIS WILL PUT HIM TWO 
IN FRONT POINTS IN GOES THE PINK IT WAS A BIT 
SCRAPPY AND MARK DAVIS WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED BUT MARK WILLIAMS GOES 
FURTHER CLEAR 
MARK DAVIS DID RALLY 
IN THIS MATCH HE WON THE NEXT TWO 
FRAMES BUT AS WE HEAD INTO 
THE 
NEXT ONE IT WAS ALL OVER FOR THE 
THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD FROM SUSSEX BECAUSE 
MARK WILLIAMS TWICE A WINNER OF 
THIS TITLE WENT OUT IN THE FIRST 
ROUND TO JOE SWAIL LAST YEAR BUT 
HE IS THROUGH TO THE SECOND ROUNDS 
SAFELY THROUGH HE WRAPPED IT UP IN 
FRAME THIRTEEN IT WAS ALL OVER BAR THE 
SHOUTING BY HIS AND HE WILL NOW 
PLAY RONNIE O'SULLIVAN OR LIU 
CHUANG IN ROUND TWO WELL DONE TO 
HIM PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IN THE 
END FOR HIM WE DID SEE A COUPLE OF 
EXAMPLES OF THE FOUL AND MISS RULE 
IN THAT FRAME WHICH DOES SEEM LIKE 
AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO RUN THE 
SECOND IN OUR MAMMOTH SERIES ON THE 
MYSTERIES OF THIS RULE KNOW IT 
IS CONFUSING BUT THIS IS POT TWO 
ALL WILL BECOME SORT OF CLEAR 
HULL AND A MISS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT AND 
THIS CANNOT BE CALLED WHEN SNOOKERS 
ARE NEEDED AS IT THE RESULT OF THE 
STROKE JUST PLAYED EVEN 
COMMENTATORS HAVE MENTIONED THIS ON 
NUMEROUS OCCASIONS 
IT WON'T BE 
CALLED A MISS BECAUSE HE NEEDS 
SNOOKERS 
BUT THIS IS NOT ENTIRELY SNOOKERS TRUE IF THE FRAME IS IN THE 
SNOOKERS REQUIRED STAGE AND A 
PLAYER MAKES NO EFFORT OR HAS NO 
INTENTION TO HIT THE BALL THE 
REFEREE HAS THE POWER TO CALL A 
MISS MISS THAT IS THE 
APPROPRIATE PHRASE THE REFEREE HAS 
THE POWER 
YES AND THE REFEREES 
HAVE HAD THE POWER AND THEY MORE 
OR LESS CALL EVERYTHING A MISS 
EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT HAVE TO 
BUT THE END RESULT IS IF YOU LOOK 
BACK TO SNOOKER BEFORE THE MISS 
RULE WHEN YOU COULD PLACE IN AND 
MISHIT GENERALLY THE GAME IS A 
BETTER GAME BECAUSE OF THE RULE 
EVEN IF IT IS UNFAIR 
DO YOU AGREE 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THERE HAS TO BE A ROLE IN 
THERE BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN 
PLAYERS THEY KNEW WHO THEY WERE 
WHO WOULD PUT THE BALL IN A CERTAIN 
POSITION AND THEY HAVEN'T MADE AN 
EFFORT TO HIT THE BALL THE ROOM IS 
THERE FOR THAT 
I CAN'T WAIT FOR 
PARTS THREE TO SEVEN PARTS EIGHT SIXTEEN 
PARTS THREE TO SEVEN HOLIDAY 
MARK WILLIAMS IS GOING THE HOLIDAY RIGHT DIRECTION BUT AT LONG LAST 
YOU FANCIED HIM TO DO O. K. HERE 
DIDN'T YOU 
HE IS MERELY PLAYING 
GOOD STUFF L. EXPECT HIM TO PRESS 
ON AND PRODUCE THAT LIKE STEPHEN 
HENDRY WAS HE IS ONE MATCH AWAY 
FROM FINDING HIS FORM PROPERLY BUT 
YOU HAVE GOT A GRIP ON THE MATCH 
TABLE 
HE WILL BE JOINING YOU IN TABLE THE QUALIFIERS NEXT SEASON BUT AT 
LEAST HE HAS NOT GONE THROUGH WITH 
HIS THREAT TO RETIRE FROM THE GAME 
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT LOSS BACK TO 
THE AUDITORIUM AND WITH MARK 
WILLIAMS HAVING FINISHED HIS MATCH 
IT IS GRAEME DOTT AND JOE PERRY WHO 
HAVE THE ATTENTION OF THE CRUCIBLE 
AUDIENCE 
GRAEME IS GETTING HIS 
GLASS OF WATER READY MUCH BETTER 
WHEN YOU HAVE GOT THE CRUCIBLE 
WATER YOURSELF AND THERE ARE NO 
DISTRACTIONS ALL TO YOURSELF 
GRAEME HAS NOT BEEN HANGING AROUND 
EVEN WITH THE SAFETY SHOTS HE IS 
GETTING TO THE TABLE AND PLAYING 
VERY FLUENTLY 
YOU CAN SEE THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE 
WITH THE WALK UP IT CHANGES 
COMPLETELY 
WALL OF COURSE IT ALSO GIVES 
THE CAMERA MEANT A BIT MORE ROOM 
WHEN YOU HAVE GOT THE FULL ARENA 
IT IS VERY TIGHT WITH THE WALL DOWN 
AND A REMARKABLE JOB HERE 
GRAEME IS LOOKING AT THE SIDE OF 
THE PACK TO MAKE SURE HE DOES PLAY 
A THIN ONE AND NOT LEAVE THE RED 
OVER THE POCKET THAT CAN HAPPEN 
UNLESS YOU'RE CAREFUL HE MAY BE 
LOOKING AT THE LOOSE RED 
IT IS NOT 
THE CORRECT ANGLE THE ONE TO THE 
RIGHT CORNER HE COULD TAKE THAT 
ONE ON AND TRY TO GET TO THE BLACK 
BUT IT WOULD TAKE THE CUE BALL A 
BIT CLOSER TO THE BLACK THERE IS 
THE ANGLE HE IS FACED WITH IF THE 
RED WAS SLIGHTLY FURTHER TO THE 
RIGHT HE WOULD HAVE A GO AT THAT A BIT TOO THIN 
JOE PERRY IS LOOKING AT THIS RED 
NOW HE CAN TAKE IT ON AND HE 
COULD DROP ON THE BLACK 
THAT IS PLAYED TO PERFECTION AND A 
LITTLE CANNON ON THE TWO REDS IF 
HE JUST GETS THEN IN BETWEEN THE 
TWO REDS HE WILL BE PERFECT ON A 
RED SORT EITHER CORNER A DELICATE 
LITTLE CANNON OH HE NEARLY MISSED 
THE BLACK HE TOOK HIS EYE OFF IT 
THE REDS ARE NICELY SPREAD IF HE 
CAN CLEAR THE TWO ABOVE THE BLACK 
HE WILL BE IN BUSINESS 
HE IS DEFINITELY GOING TO MOVE THE 
OTHER RED IN POTTING THIS ONE 
A COUPLE OF OPTIONS HERE CERTAINLY 
A RED THAT POTS TO THE LEFT CORNER 
AND THERE IS A RED IN THE SAME 
POCKET AS THE BLACK THE ANGLE ON 
THE BLACK WAS NOT THAT GREAT THAT IS NICELY JUDGED AS WELL 
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE BEST ANGLE ON 
THE BLACK HE NEEDS TO GET BACK 
PAST WHERE THE WHITE IS NOW TO 
LEAVE A RED INTO THE SAME POCKET AS 
THE BLACK L. WONDER IF THE PINK IS 
AVAILABLE THE PINK WILL GET HIM 
BACK TO LEAVE THAT RED 
HE HAS LEFT IT A BIT SHORT HE 
STILL CAN TAKE THIS ON THE PINK 
MAY HAVE TO GO UP ON TO THE BROWN 
SPOT THAT IS THE ONLY SPOT 
AVAILABLE 
I THINK HE GOT A HEAVY CONTACT 
THERE IT MAY HAVE SPOILED THINGS A 
BIT THE TWO REDS ARE COVERED NOW 
INTO THE LEFT CORNER IF HE BRINGS 
THE RED BACK HE WOULD HAVE TO BE 
PRETTY PRECISE 
HE HAS PLAYED THE CANNON HE CANNOT QUITE GET TO THIS TO CURE 
IT PROPERLY THAT IS THE ONLY WORRY 
THAT WOULD BE THE STRAIGHTFORWARD 
RED 
ONCE AGAIN GOOD STRIKING THESE 
REDS ARE REALLY OPEN NOW THINK 
BOTH REDS MIGHT POT THE DID THE 
OPPOSITE CORNER POT INTO THE 
OPPOSITE CORNER 
HE COULD PLAY ANOTHER CANNON HERE 
ON TO BE LITTLE TRIANGLE OF REDS 
AND HE WOULD HAVE A CHANTS CHOICE 
OF POT AVAILABLE TO HIM LOOKS PRETTY GOOD 
GRAEME DOTT'S POOR SAFETY SHOT TOO 
THIN 
THIS IS A GOOD START FOR JOE PERRY 
AFTER THE MID SESSION INTERVAL THE 
STANDARD HAS BEEN PRETTY HIGH IN 
THIS MATCH SO FAR 
GRAEME DOTT HAD A SIXTY FOUR BREAK IN THE 
OPENING FRAME JOE PERRY HAD A FORTY SIX 
IN THE SECOND FORTY SEVEN IN THE THIRD FIFTY SIX 
FROM GRAEME DOTT IN THE FOURTH 
FRAME AND NOW THIS AS YOU 
MENTIONED EARLIER IT WILL BE A 
CLOSE MATCH THIS HE WOULD HAVE 
THE FEEL YOU WOULD HAVE TO FEEL 
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS THAT WAY I 
ALWAYS FELT IT WOULD BE 
HE HAS JUST TAKEN TWO PINK'S SO FAR 
AT ALL THE REST BLACKS IF HE 
KNOCKS THIS IN THE FRAME IS NOT 
YET SECURED 
THE CUE BALL RACED OFF THE CUSHION 
THERE HE IS NOT ON THE NEXT RED 
IT SEEMED TO REALLY SPRING THERE IT CAME OFF THE CUSHION QUICKER THAN IT WENT ON 
HE NEEDS ONE MORE RED HE IS NOT 
SAFE YET HE IS NOW 
IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE POT THERE HE 
DID NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
POSITION 
ALWAYS NICE TO MAKE A CENTURY BREAK 
AND HE HAS MADE SEVENTY FIVE IN HIS CAREER 
HE TURNED PROFESSIONAL IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO HE 
HAS HAD SEVEN CENTURIES AT THE 
CRUCIBLE 
IN FACT HIS HIGHEST TOURNAMENT 
BREAK WAS MADE IN THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE HE IS A VERY 
ACCOMPLISHED BREAK BUILDER 
HE HAS PLAYED A COUPLE OF LOVELY 
LITTLE CANNONS IN THIS BREAK PERFECTLY PLAYED 
I THINK HE LIKES THE LONGER MATCHES 
HE HAS DONE WELL IN THE U. K. 
CHAMPIONSHIP MORE THAN ONCE GOT TO 
THE SEMI FINALS 
THE QUARTER FINALS LAST YEAR A 
GREAT CENTURY BREAK HERE IT GIVES 
HIM THE CHANCE TO REALLY SHOWED HOW 
MUCH HE LIKES THE LONGER SESSIONS 
THIS HAS BEEN GOOD EFFORT 
AS LONG AS HE GOT THE CENTURY BREAK 
THAT IS WHAT HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT 
A GREAT START TO THIS SESSION 
IT IS BUILDING UP VERY NICELY BOTH 
PLAYERS SHOWING PRETTY GOOD FORM 
BUT THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO START 
THIS SESSION WITH A CENTURY A A GOOD CENTURY HE GOT IN FROM A GOOD 
LONG RED WE SAW EARLIER ON THE 
MISTAKE THAT GRAEME DOTT ACTUALLY 
MADE WITH THIS SAFETY IT WAS A 
REASONABLY MINOR ERROR REALLY 
HE CREATED IT REALLY IN MANY WAYS 
IT WAS A GOOD BREAK WE WILL LOOK 
AGAIN AT THE SAFETY SHOT THAT 
GRAEME DOTT PLAYED IT WAS NOT A 
GOOD SAFETY BUT IT WAS NOT A GOOD 
RED HE STARTED WITH WHEN YOU SEE 
THE WAY THE BALLS FINISH 
HE CAUGHT 
IT TOO THIN I GUESS THIS WILL TEST GRAEME DOTT 
WE KNOW HE HAS NOT BEEN FEELING ALL 
THAT RED ABOUT HIS SNOOKER HE IS 
SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION SO NOW 
THAT HE HAS GONE BEHIND AND JOE 
PERRY IS SHOWING SIGNS HE IS 
PLAYING WELL IS HE PREPARED TO 
BATTLE AS WE KNOW HE CAN HE IS A 
VERY TENACIOUS PLAYER THIS WILL BE 
THE TEST NOW THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
FRAMES I WOULD THINK THIS IS A BETTER SAFETY SHOT 
JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO THE 
RIGHT AND HE COULD HAVE HAD THE 
SNOOKER THERE THERE IS A RED TO 
THE LEFT CORNER THAT JOE PERRY IS 
LOOKING 
HE CAUGHT THE OTHER RED HAS HE GOT 
AWAY WITH THIS HE IS VERY LUCKY YOU CANNOT BEAT A BIT OF LUCK 
ONCE HE CANNON THAT RED JOE PERRY 
WOULD HAVE FELT HE COULD LEAVE 
SOMETHING 
GRAEME DOTT CAN POT THE RED INTO 
THE BOTTOM RIGHT HERE BUT HE WILL 
BE THE REST AND MAYBE THE 
EXTENSION HE WILL NEED THE REST 
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A TIGHT 
MATCH THE BOOKMAKERS HAD JOE PERRY 
AS THE SLIGHT FAVOURITE THEY HAVE 
MET ON FOUR OCCASIONS THEY HAVE 
ONE TO EACH WHAT LOT TO CHOOSE 
BETWEEN THEM THEY HAVE ONE TWO 
EACH NOT A LOT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN 
THEM JUST TOO HARD 
IT'S THIS SORT OF FRAME THAT 
NEITHER PLAYER LIKES WHEN THE 
BALLS GO UP THE OTHER END OF THE 
TABLE 
IT IS WHO CAN GET THE WHITE BACK 
BEHIND THE BLACK AND CLOSE TO THE 
CUSHION THAT WILL GAIN THE BIGGEST 
ADVANTAGE 
IF HE TRIES THAT HERE OFF THE REDS 
THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BUNCH HE 
CAN'T BRING A RED OUT AND COME BACK 
WITH HIM 
HE TURNS AROUND IMMEDIATELY AND HAS 
A BIG LAUGH ABOUT THAT THAT CAN 
HAPPEN WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO ROLL 
TO THE REDS 
SURELY THIS RED DOES NOT GO TO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET HE DID NOT FANCY 
RISKING TRYING TO GET BACK BEHIND 
THE BLACK 
IS THERE SOMETHING INTO THE LEFT 
MIDDLE POCKET IT DOES NOT LOOK AS 
IF IT GOES IT DOES 
IF THIS TRICKY LITTLE CUT IN DROPS 
IN HE COULD GIVE HIMSELF A CHANCE 
IT IS A REASONABLE CHANCE BUT 
THERE ARE A LOT OF AWKWARD REDS 
LITTLE CLUSTER OF SIX HE WILL DO 
WELL TO MAKE FIFTY OR SIXTY FROM THIS 
THE NEXT RED IS A BIT OF A CUEING 
SHOT AS WELL 
HE DOES NOT REALLY LIKE THIS IT IS 
NOT A STRAIGHT AS HE WOULD LIKE 
AS STRAIGHT 
IT IS A GOOD SHOT WHEN YOU HAVE 
MADE A CENTURY BREAK YOU TEND TO 
HAVE GOOD RHYTHM IN THE NEXT 
FRAME IT GIVES YOU CONFIDENCE 
ABSOLUTELY 
HE IS HAVING A GOOD LOOK AROUND THE 
TABLE TO SEE IF THERE IS A 
POSSIBLE PLANT ON L. DO NOT THINK 
THE RED NEXT TO THE YELLOW IS 
POTABLE 
I THINK HE HAS SPOTTED A PLANT BUT 
THERE IS A RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE 
GREEN THAT IS AVAILABLE 
THE TWO REDS TO THE RIGHT OF THE 
BUNCH ONE OF THOSE WILL DEFINITELY 
POT 
HE IS BACK LOOKING AT THE PLANT 
AGAIN THOSE OF THE TWO REDS THAT 
HE HAS BEEN LOOKING NOT BAD COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE HOW WELL HE 
CONTROLS THE CUE BALL BECAUSE THAT 
WAS A SMALL GAP HE PLAYED INTO 
THERE 
HE IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT ON THE 
BLUE HE IS GETTING INTO A GOOD 
GROOVE NOW 
HE HAS GONE INTO NO MAN'S LAND 
THERE COMPLETELY BETWEEN TWO SHOTS 
NOT EVEN SURE WHAT RED HE PLAYED ON 
I'M ASSUMING HE PLAYED ON THE TOP 
ONE OF THE TWO BUT HE WENT TOO FAR 
BUT NOT FAR ENOUGH TO BE RIGHT 
BEHIND THE RED NEXT TO THE BLACK 
IF YOU WERE PROBABLY GETTING DOWN 
TO TAKE THAT ON FOR YOUR FIRST 
CHART YOU'D PROBABLY POT IT BUT 
THE FACT YOU KNOW YOU'VE PLAYED 
POOR POSITIONAL SHOT IT SEEMS TO 
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE RED NEXT TO 
THE YELLOW BUT JOE PERRY DIDN'T 
PLAY FOR IT SO IT'S NOT AVAILABLE 
HE'S GOT QUITE WAY TO TRAVEL WITH 
THE CUE BALL IF HE WANTS TO GET ON 
THAT RED TO THE LEFT OF THE THREE 
HOW WAS YOUR PACE IT LOOKS PRETTY 
GOOD TO ME 
IT LOOKS AS IF THAT OTHER ONE IS 
AVAILABLE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRY 
AND CANNON INTO THEM 
THE TIP OF THE CUE IS WHERE HE 
WANTS TO SCREW BACK TO 
HE PLAYED THAT O. K. HE HAD TO RUN 
THROUGH ON TO THE BLACK BUT HE IS A 
COUPLE OF INCHES SHORT OF BEEN 
PERFECT THIS TIME 
HE'S GOT THE POT AND HE IS O. K. ON 
THE POSITION 
CUEING VERY SMOOTHLY AT THE POLE 
MOMENT BOTH PLAYERS ARE 
IF HE SCREWS STRAIGHT BACK AND HE 
WILL KISS INTO THE OTHER RED 
HE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO CANNON INTO 
THAT 
BREAKING DOWN AND THE END BUT AT 
LEAST HE'S PLAYED A GOOD SAFETY 
SHOT AND IT BROUGHT HIM BACK INTO 
THE FRAME 
IT'S GONE A BIT AWKWARD NOW WITH 
THE REDS OF THE OTHER END OF THE 
ALL SIX REMAINING REDS UP PAST THE 
BLUE SPOT DON'T SEE THAT VERY 
OFTEN 
I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I'VE 
NEVER SEEN ALL THE REDS DOWN THERE 
YOU ARE ALWAYS A BIT ANXIOUS WHEN 
YOU SEE THE WHITE COMING UP TOWARDS 
THE CORNER POCKET 
JUST WONDERING IF HE IS GOING TO 
TRY TO PLAY OFF THIS RED AND GET 
BEHIND THE YELLOW AND GREEN NOT A BAD EFFORT 
HE TOOK THE DOUBLE ON AND IT TURNED 
OUT IT COULD NEARLY BE TRAVEL TREBLE 
I DON'T THINK GRAEME HAS DONE AN 
AWFUL LOT OF DAMAGE THERE 
HE GOT A BAD KICK PROBABLY STOP IT 
IN ITS TRACKS THAT CUE BALL 
GRADUALLY THEY MIGHT NOT THE REDS 
BACK UP INTO THE NORMAL POSITION 
THERE IS ONE THAT HAS COME BACK 
THIS END OF THE TABLE 
GRAEME HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE 
THAT'S WHY HE'S PLAYING IT SLOWLY 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO PUSH THE REDS 
OUT INTO OPEN PLAY 
BOTH PLAYERS WILL HAVE TO BE 
CAREFUL THEY DON'T LEAVE THE OTHER 
ONE CHANCE TO PLAY UP BEHIND THE YELLOW AND GREEN 
HE HAS PLAYED FOR THE BAULK CUSHION 
AND IT IS PRETTY GOOD SHOT THAT 
HAS BROUGHT THE FRAME BACK TO 
NORMALITY 
I JUST WONDER HOW JOE WILL RESPOND 
TO THAT 
HE CAUGHT THAT QUITE THICK ALL 
CREDIT FOR THAT SHOT FROM GRAEME 
DOTT THAT WAS A GOOD ONE THE 
FRAME IS GOING NOWHERE FOR HIM L. 
DON'T THINK HE IS IN THE MOOD TO 
TIPTOE AROUND BARGH TODAY AROUND 
MUCH TODAY THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD SHOT 
THE RED THAT IS NEAR THE BLUE 
THEY ARE AWKWARD BECAUSE THE PATH 
BACK DOWN THE TABLE HE COULD CANNON 
INTO THOSE 
HE HAS AVOIDED THE CONTACT ON TO 
THEM 
A GOOD SHOT HE HAD A GO AT THE POT 
BUT HE MADE SURE HE DIDN'T CANNON 
INTO THE RED ON THE BLUE AND THE 
BLUE 
JOE HAS GOT A PROBLEM NOW THAT 
SHAKE OF THE HEAD TELLS YOU I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
IT'S NOT EVEN ONE OF THESE 
SITUATIONS WHERE YOU CAN SAY I'VE 
GOT NO SAFETY I'M GOING TO GO FOR 
A POT THERE DOESN'T EVEN SEEM TO 
BE A POT ON HERE 
HE WANTED THE CUE BALL TO AVOID THE 
RED SO THE DOUBLE KISS COULD BE 
VERY COSTLY IT WAS SO DIFFICULT TO 
AVOID 
IF IT HAD GOT INTO THAT CORNER HE 
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED TO 
KEEP IT SAFE THE DOUBLE KISS IS HARD TO AVOID VERY WELL PLAYED A GOOD CHANCE NOW FOR GRAEME DOTT 
ALL THE REDS ARE IMPOSSIBLE 
POSITIONS IN POTTABLE POSITIONS 
IF HE HOLDS INSULT TOGETHER HE 
COULD BE BACK ALL SQUARE HOLDS 
THEM ALL 
I THINK HE GOT A HEAVY CONTACT 
THERE 
BIGGER LOOKS A STRAIGHT THERE FORWARD CLEAR UP AND THEN YOU GET 
BACK HE CONTACT IT LOOKS IT IS 
AMAZING WHAT CAN GO WRONG A 
HEAVY CONTACT LOOKING GOOD NOW 
HE WILL NEED THE RED BEHIND THE 
BLACK THE OTHER TWO ARE VERY 
STRAIGHTFORWARD WHERE THEY ARE 
ESPECIALLY NOW HE HAS GOT THE BLUE 
ON ITS SPOT TAKING THIS QUITE 
LIKELY THE NEXT COUPLE OF SHOTS 
NO PROBLEM HERE 
IT IS HOW HE PLAYS ON THE RED 
BEHIND THE BLACK 
WHAT SORT OF ANGLE HAS HE GOT ON 
THE PINK HE HAS LEFT BIT STRAIGHT 
BECAUSE HE CAN LAND THE CUE BALL 
WHERE I HAVE PUT THE CUE BALL BUT 
I THINK HE IS STRAIGHT ON THE PINK 
HE MAY HAVE TO TAKE THE BLUE TO GET 
THERE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BOUNCE TOO FAR HE NEEDS A RED AND A COLOUR 
GOOD SHOT IN THE END I THINK IT 
WORKED OUT IN HIS FAVOUR THE 
SLIGHT ANGLE ON THE RED SO THAT HE 
COULD LAND ON THE BLACK IT LOOKS 
LIKE THE FRAME IS OVER NOW AS LONG 
AS HE CAN POT A HIGH COLOUR A PRETTY GRITTY LITTLE BREAK THIS 
THIRTY THREE N. T. S. THE DIFFERENCE IT LOOKS 
LIKE IT WILL BE THREE TO THREE JOE PERRY HAS 
COME BACK TO THE TABLE 
HE HAD A QUICK GLANCE AT THE 
SCOREBOARD IT IS ALL ACADEMIC NOW 
BECAUSE HE HAS STUCK THE YELLOW UP 
HE DID WELL 
JUST HIT AS MUCH AS 
YOU CAN SEE I SUPPOSE IT WAS 
QUITE CLOSE TO THE CUSHION THE FRAME IS WON NOW 
WE ARE BACK TO HONOURS EVEN JOE 
PERRY CONCEDES IT IS GOOD SCRAP BETWEEN THESE TWO 
WE WILL KEEP YOU IN 
TOUCH WITH HOW THAT ONE DEVELOPS AS 
WE GO ON BUT ON A GENERAL POINT 
ASSESS THE WAY JOE PERRY HAS BEEN 
PLAYING WE SAW A CENTURY FROM HIM 
EARLIER WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT HIS 
GAME 
HE IS SCORING TO BE BRUTALLY GAME HONEST I LED EIGHT TO FOUR AGAINST HIM AND 
HE STAYED AROUND L. COULDN'T SCORE 
HEAVILY ENOUGH BUT WHEN IT WENT TO 
EIGHT TO SEVEN THAT WAS THE BEST SNOOKER HE 
PLAYED IN THE MATCH THE LAST THREE 
FRAMES HE PLAYED REALLY WELL HE 
STRUCK THE BALL WELL WHEN HE WAS 
NEAR THE WINNING LINE STEVE SAGNA 
SLEEP SORRY 
THEY ARE BOTH SLEEP SORRY STUBBORN PLAYERS IT IS FAIR TO 
SAY SORRY 
HAD HIS HEAD DROPPED AND JOE PERRY 
GOT OFF TO A GOOD START BEING IN A 
BETTER FRAME OF MIND HE COULD HAVE 
GONE FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH NOW 
THAT GRAEME IS SHOWING STRENGTH IN 
THE EARLY POT OF THIS MATCH IT IS 
GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY 
BOTH OF 
THEM ARE RENNET AND IT IS GOOD TO 
SEE GRAEME COMPETING WITH HIS BAD 
SEASON SO FAR 
AN UPDATE ON THE LAST OF OUR JUNIOR 
POT BLACK QUARTER FINALS THIS IS 
THE NUMBER ONE PLAYER IN THE 
SCOTTISH UNDER SIXTEEN RANKINGS HE DID 
NOT GET MUCH OF A CHANCE AGAINST 
THE EXPERIENCED FOURTEEN YEAR OLD FROM 
WALES JONES WAS WITH US HERE LAST 
YEAR IN JUNIOR POT BLACK AND HE 
LOOKED VERY CONFIDENT AS HE CAUGHT 
MEET AMASSED A BREAK OF SIXTY NINE STRAIGHT 
OFF THE BAT HE WAS A RUNAWAY 
WINNER BY NINETEEN POINTS NINE NINETY NINE 
WE HAVE GOT THE OTHER THREE SEMI 
FINALISTS OF JUNIOR POT BLACK WITH 
ME NOW AN EXCELLENT START TO YOUR 
MATCH YOU HAD A BREAK OF SIXTY NINE L. 
THINK THE EXPERIENCE TOLD BECAUSE 
YOU'RE HERE LAST YEAR TELL US 
ABOUT THE VALUE OF THAT EXPERIENCE 
THIS TIME 
IT WAS GOOD BECAUSE WHEN 
I CAME HERE LAST YEAR THIS YEAR I 
KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT L. KNEW THAT 
THERE WERE GOOD PLAYERS HERE IT 
WAS DISAPPOINTING TO LOSE LAST YEAR 
BUT I HOPE TO GET TO THE FINAL THIS 
YEAR 
HAPPY WITH YOUR OPENING YEAR FRAME A IT WAS A GOOD START AND I 
HOPE THEY CAN PLAY BETTER IN THE 
SEMI FINAL YOU ARE THE WILD CARD 
CHOSEN BY THE ACADEMY TO COME AND 
TAKE POT IS THAT YOU'RE NORMAL 
PLACE WHERE YOU PRACTICE WHAT IS 
YOUR NORMAL ROUTINE 
I USUALLY 
PRACTISE AT THE ONE FOR SEVENTH SNOOKER 
CLUB WHERE SHAUN MURPHY PRACTICE IS 
OFF HIM PRACTICES OFTEN YOU YOU HAVE GOT FANTASTIC TABLES THERE 
BUT YOU HAVE ALSO GOT A LOT OF 
ADVICE FROM SHAUN MURPHY WHAT SORT 
OF ADVICE HAS HE BEEN GIVING YOU 
JUST SOME SHOTS LIKE SIDES BEEN 
CUT BASIC SHOTS THAT I NEED TO FIND 
OUT SIDE SPIN IT IS WONDERFUL 
TO HAVE A FORMER WORLD CHAMPION

PREPARED ALL OF YOU WE WILL BE 
CATCHING UP WITH THEM LATER ON 
LAST YEAR WE RUN OUR FRAME WITH 
DAVIS SERIES ONE OF THE STARS WE 
SPOKE TO WAS DUNCAN BAIN A TIME 
FROM DRAGONS' DEN HE TOLD US SOME 
CHOICE TALES ABOUT HIS TIME IN THE 
MERCHANT NAVY AND SETTING UP HIS 
FIRST BUSINESS IN AN ICE CREAM VAN 
HE DONE WELL SINCE THEN AND HE 
IS A BIG SNOOKER FAN THIS YEAR WE 
HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO ONE OF HIS 
FELLOW DRAGONS FOR HIS SECRET 
PASSION FOR THE SPORT 
JAMES JAMES KHAN 
I LOVE THE GAME I 
STARTED IN THE MID EIGHTIES WHICH WAS 
PERFECT IT WAS SCREAMING OUT FOR A 
SNOOKER TABLE AND HAVING WATCHED 
THE GAME FOR MANY YEARS ON T. V. IT 
WAS SOMETHING THAT REALLY APPEALED 
TO ME AS I PUT THE TABLE IN MY 
HOUSE OBVIOUSLY ONCE YOU GET INTO 
IT AND YOU PLAY AND PRACTISE AND 
IT IS SUCH A SOCIAL GAME WHENEVER 
SOMEBODY COMES ROUND BECAUSE IT 
WAS IN MY LOUNGE THE FIRST THING 
THEY WOULD DO 
IS PICK UP CUE IT IS A FANTASTIC GAME AND I AM A REAL 
FAN IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO THERE 
WAS A CELEBRITY TOURNAMENT AND I 
WAS THERE AND YOU HAD TO AUCTION 
TO PLAY STEVE DAVIS AND STEPHEN 
HENDRY AT THAT TIME THEY WERE 
BOTH MY IDOLS L. IMAGINED HAVING AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH BOTH OF 
THOSE SO WHY DID TO HAVE AGAIN IT 
WAS A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE I 
BEAT THE ONLY THING IS STEPHEN 
HENDRY I BROKE AND HE CLEARED THE 
TABLE NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO GET SECOND SHOT 
NOT TOO BAD MY HIGHEST BREAK WAS 
FORTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CRACK AT 
MANAGING RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IT 
MIGHT JUST MAKE DIFFERENCE TO HIS 
COMMERCIAL APPROACH TO THE GAME I 
THINK I WOULD GET HIM TO SLOW DOWN 
A BIT BITING SOMETIMES FROM WHAT 
I HAVE SEEN AND THE WAY HE 
APPROACHES THE GAME HE TENDS TO 
RUSH IT I THINK AS HE GETS INTO 
THE GAME SOMETIMES A MAN THAT IS 
SO TALENTED MAKES SOME REALLY 
SIMPLE MISTAKES YOU SIT THERE AND 
THINK OH GOD RONNIE WHAT HAVE 
YOU DONE WHEREAS THERE ARE OTHER 
PLAYERS WHO APPEAR MORE COMPOSED 
WITH THE GAME SOMEONE LIKE PETER 
EBDON WHO IS SO TENSE AND FOCUSED 
ON EVERY SHOT IS ABSOLUTELY 
CLINICAL WHEREAS I THINK RONNIE IS 
IN A RACE HE HAS GOT TO GET ROUND 
THE TABLE WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING 
LIKE THAT IT IS EASIER TO MAKE 
MISTAKES MISTAKES WHEN JOHN HIGGINS BROKE DOWN CRYING 
THAT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL MOMENT L. 
THINK HE WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT FOR ME 
THE GUY WHO REALLY MADE SNOOKER 
INTO POPULAR SPORT SIR THE 
MEMORY OF HIGGINS WHEN HE PLAYED 
WAS FOR ME QUITE A MEMORABLE MOMENT 
SO 
I WONDER IF STEVE CAN 
REMEMBER HIS GAME WITH HIM 
NO I 
DON'T BUT HONEST AND ACCURATE 
WORDS ANYBODY WHO SAYS THEIR 
HIGHEST BREAK IS FORTY SEVEN IS NOT LYING 
EVERYBODY USUALLY SAYS AT LEAST FIFTY FOUR 
SO ANYBODY WHO SAYS FORTY SEVEN HE IS 
TELLING THE TRUTH 
I THOUGHT HE WAS 
SHREWD WITH HIS MONEY WHY ME WANT 
TO PLAY AGAINST YOU 
THE OFFER TO 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN MIGHT MAKE HIM A 
FEW MORE BOB NOT A BAD ONE YOU YOU NEVER KNOW 
I'M SURE HE COULD DO 
WITH SOME SPONSORSHIP IN CHINA 
WHERE THE GAME IS ROCKETING IN 
POPULARITY AND RIGHT NOW MOST OF 
CHINA WILL HAVE SEEN A LITTLE BIT 
OF THE GAME BETWEEN MARCO FU ONE 
OF THE RISING STARS IN HONG KONG 
AND THIS FELLOW WE ARE ABOUT TO 
MEET NOW DING JUNHUI WITHOUT 
QUESTION ONE OF THE MOST 
RECOGNISABLE SPORTSMAN IN CHINA 
TODAY 
MARCO FU IS ENJOYING THE BEST 
SEASON OF HIS CAREER HAVING WORKED 
HIS FIRST RANKING TITLE IN ABERDEEN 
LAST AUTUMN HIS RECORD IS VERY 
STRONG AGAINST DING JUNHUI THREE 
WINS OUT OF FIVE 
THE MATCHES AT 
THE CRUCIBLE ON MASSIVE BUT EVEN 
MORE SO BECAUSE I'M PLAYING AGAINST 
DING JUNHUI IN THE FIRST MATCH I'M 
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE MATCH AND A 
LITTLE BIT NERVOUS HE IS PLAYING A 
GAME THAT REALLY SUITS ME A LITTLE 
BIT LIKE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HE 
PLAYS A GREAT ATTACKING GAME AND A 
VERY OPEN GAME HE DOESN'T HANG 
ABOUT AND PLAY SAFETY THAT MUCH IT 
CAN BRING THE BEST OUT OF ME L. 
PLAYED DING IN WEMBLEY IN JANUARY 
THE VIEWING FIGURE WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED 
MILLION BACK HOME L. THINK EVEN 
MORE SO FOR THIS ONE BECAUSE THIS 
IS THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IT'S 
GOING TO BE INTERESTING THERE WILL 
BE A LOT OF INTEREST BACK HOME NOT 
SO MUCH IN HONG KONG BUT MORE IN 
CHINA BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE 
WATCHING IN CHINA THEY LOVE 
SNOOKER OVER THERE 
ONE HUNDRED MILLION 
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT THOSE ARE 
RATINGS THIS IS THE MATCH THAT 
COUNTS FOUR HALF OF CHINA AND A LOT 
OF HONG KONG WE WILL JOIN IT IN 
FRAME ONE DING AT THE TABLE ELEVEN 
POINTS BEHIND COMMENTARY FROM 
TERRY GO VERVE'S AND CLIVE EVERTON 
TERRY GRIFFITHS 
HE NEEDS TO GET 
ONTO THE LAST RED BLUE LOOKS 
FAVOURITE 
IF HE PLAYED FOR THE BLUE HE HIT 
IT MUCH TOO HARD I'M NOT SURE WHAT 
HE PLAYED THEM 
TO ME IT LOOKED AS IF YOU CAN GET 
ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE BLUE 
PERHAPS THE RED WAS A BIT THINNER 
THAN IT LOOKED 
HE MAY BE THINKING OF PLAYING A 
SNOOKER 
THE ODDS BECAUSE THE SNOOKER PLAYERS MIND SAID HAS CHANGED OVER 
THE YEARS WITH THIS NEW MISS RULE 
YOU COULD WIN THE FRAME HERE WITH 
JUST ROLLING UP BEHIND THE PINK 
WHICH IS WHY A LOT OF THE PLAYERS 
DON'T AGREE WITH THE RULE 
EVEN IF IT IS A SNOOKER IT'S AN 
EASY HIT 
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR BREAKFAST 
YOU SEE 
HE IS PLAYING THE SHOT THE RIGHT 
WAY IF HE PLAYED THIS WOULD PLACE 
THE CHANCES ARE THAT HE COULD LEAVE 
IT DEAD WEIGHT 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD SHOT FROM AND 
DING 
THAT'S AN AWKWARD ONE TO HIT IT 
LOOKS FROM HERE IS IF THE BROWN 
COULD BE IN THE WAY OF THE NATURAL 
SHOT OFF THE RIGHT HAND CUSHION PRICELESS 
THEY ARE APPLAUDING BECAUSE HE 
POTTED THE RED BUT THAT WAS A VERY 
VERY GOOD HIT AND VERY FORTUNATE TO 
POT THE RED HE ALSO GOT A VERY 
GOOD NUDGE OFF THE MIDDLE KNUCKLE 
TO COME OUT FOR THAT BLUE 
YES THE LATTER PART OF THE FRAME 
WAS RUNNING IN DING'S FAVOUR BUT 
IT ALL CHANGED IN AN INSTANT 
THROUGH HUGE SLICE OF LUCK 
EVEN SO ONE THAT MARCO FU WOULD 
HAVE EXPECTED TO POT 
I THINK THE YELLOW WAS THE POOR 
SHOT CLIVE HE SHOULD HAVE LEFT 
THE CUE BALL ON THE BACK RIGHT 
CUSHION AND THEN THE GREEN IS 
ALMOST UNMISSABLE 
HE HAS OVERDONE IT PLAYED FOR IT 
IN THE MIDDLE BUT I THINK HE CAN 
POT THE PINK IN THE BOTTOM POCKET 
AND RUN THROUGH FOR THE BLACK 
IT LOOKED AS IF THE FRAME WAS GOING 
TO BE SNATCHED AWAY FROM DING WHEN 
MARCO FU HAD A SPECTACULAR FOR GONE 
LAST RED BUT HE MISSED THE GREEN 
TINKLY AT THE LAST FIVE COLOURS TO 
TAKE THE OPENING FRAME DING 
JUNHUI JUNHUI A HIGH CLASS START TO THE MATCH 
THE NEXT TWO FRAMES WERE SHARED SO 
WE'RE GOING TO JOIN THEM IN FRAME 
FOUR THIRTY YEAR OLD MARCO FU HAS 
ALREADY SECURED HIS PLACE IN THE 
TOP SIXTEEN FOR A THIRD TIME AFTER A 
GREAT SEASON HE IS AT THE TABLE 
IN GENERAL THEY HAVEN'T BEEN 
TAKING BALLS LONG ON HIS BOTTOM 
CUSHION WITH PACE 
WOULD YOU AGREE 
TERRY THAT POTS ALONG THE BACK ROW 
ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT IN 
THIS CHAMPIONSHIP THAN IN SOME 
PREVIOUS CHAMPIONSHIPS 
I THINK OF 
PACE THEY ARE YES 
YOU DO GET SLIGHT VARIATIONS DON'T 
YOU EVEN WHEN YOU WERE TRYING FOR 
COMPLETE UNIFORMITY MICHAELA TABB 
CLEANING THE CUE BALL BETWEEN 
FRAMES SHE ACTUALLY SPOTTED THAT 
THERE WAS SMALL CHIP TAKEN OUT OF 
THE YELLOW SHE SENT OUT FOR 
ANOTHER ONE 
THE BALL'S ARE PRECISELY MATCHED 
FOR WEIGHT 
IF THE CUE BALL WAS LIGHTER THAN 
THE OTHER BALLS IT WOULD SCREW BACK 
FURTHER BUT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT 
TO RUN THROUGH 
IN A GAME THAT DEMANDS POSITION IT 
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO 
PLAY WITH A LIGHTER ONE 
SOME OF THE CLUB PLAYERS THINK HOW 
GOOD THEY ARE WHEN THEY'RE SCREWING 
BACK FIVE AND SIX F. T. AND THEN THEY GET 
THERE THE PROPER CUE BALL AND DO 
WELL TO BRING IT BACK SIX INCHES 
VERY THIN CUT WITH THE BLACK 
REQUIRED TO KEEP THIS BREAK GOING 
VERY GOOD A LITTLE UNFORTUNATE 
THAT THE KISS WITH THE KISS 
WE ARE NOW WELL INTO THIRTY NINE MINUTES FOR 
THESE FIRST FRAMES THEY ARE 
SPEEDING UP 
IT WAS VERY COMMON IN 
THE EIGHTIES TO AVERAGE HALF AN HOUR A 
FRAME 
NOW TWENTY MINUTES OR EVEN LESS IS MORE 
THE NORM 
IF DING JUNHUI KEEPS GOING HERE 
THAT SHOULD BRING THE AVERAGE DOWN 
A BIT 
SETTLE DOWN PLEASE 
THE KILLER IS 
ASKING THE CROWD TO BE QUIET AFTER 
THE INTERVAL MICHAELA TABB 
WHEN THEY WALK IN THE PLAYERS ON 
BOTH TABLES CONCEDED PEOPLE COMING 
IN DOWN THE STAIRS THEY CAN SEE 
THE PEOPLE COMING IN WHEN YOUR 
CONCENTRATION IS ACTUAL PEAK YOU 
DO NOT SEE ANYTHING YOUR PEAK 
YOU CAN HEAR THE APPLAUSE FROM THE 
OTHER TABLE THE PLAYERS COMING OUT 
THIS IS BETTER FROM DING JUNHUI 
THE FIRST CHANCE HE HAS LOOKED IN 
CONTROL OF THINGS 
AND NOW IF THERE IS SUCH A THING 
A CAST IRON CERTAINTY TO CLINCH THE 
FRAME NOW AT THIS VISIT 
PLAYING FOR A CHOICE OF TWO ONE IN 
DECEMBER THE OTHER IN THE RIGHT 
CORNER ONE IN THE CENTRE 
MARCO FU AND ALREADY MEETS TWO 
SNOOKER'S HE ALREADY NEEDS TWO 
SNOOKERS 
THAT IS AN ACADEMIC POINT WITH 
DING JUNHUI ALREADY IN POSITION 
THIS IS ONLY HIS FIFTH YEAR AS A 
PROFESSIONAL ALREADY HE HAS MADE 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN PROFESSIONAL CENTURIES APPRECIATIVE APPLAUSE A WELL CONTROLLED CENTURY 
THE BLACK WAS VERY STRAIGHT SO 
THAT WAS A GREAT SHOT FROM DING 
JUNHUI HE COULD SET 
FOR THE 
HIGHEST BREAK PRIZE NOW 
I DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO MISS THAT 
YELLOW HE COULD HAVE MADE ONE HUNDRED FORTY HE 
ACTUALLY MADE ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN 
IT WAS ONLY A YEAR AGO THAT HE MADE 
HIS CRUCIBLE DEBUT AND HE WAS 
COMPLETELY OVERPOWERED TEN TO TWO BY 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN L. WONDER WHAT 
DIFFERENCES YOU SEE IN HIM SINCE 
THEN 
HE HAS NOT HAD THE GREATEST THEN OF SEASONS BUT HE SHOWED SOME 
EXCELLENT FORM IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE THIS YEAR HE IS A POSSIBLE 
WINNER OF THE EVENT NEXT YEAR HE 
IS A VERY POSSIBLE WEATHER HE IS 
COMING TO AN AGE WHERE PLAYERS 
MATURE HE IS TWENTY ONE NOW SO IF HE GETS 
A HEAD OF STEAM UP HE COULD BLITZ 
PEOPLE OF THE TABLE 
IT IS A 
FASCINATING MATCH BECAUSE MARCO FU 
SAID HE LIKES TO PLAY GUYS WITH AN 
OPEN STYLE WHY WOULD THAT BE 
I DO 
NOT KNOW L. THINK HE HAS DEVELOPED 
INTO A TOP CLASS MATCH PLAYER L. L. DO 
NOT KNOW WHY HE WOULD PREFER ONE 
STYLE OVER ANOTHER BUT AT THE END 
OF THE DAY HOWEVER YOU ARE PUT IN 
FRONT OF YOU HAVE TO BEAT THEM 
MAYBE HAVING SOMEBODY GETTING ON 
WITH IT SUITS HIM IN HIS OWN MIND 
IT IS DEVELOPING INTO AN 
INTERESTING MATCH 
IF THE CUE BALL HAD NOT DROPPED IN 
HE WOULD HAVE HAD TRICKY NEXT 
CHALK BUT SINCE IT HAS HE HAS CUT 
THE COMPARATIVELY EASY RED FROM THE 
BAULK LINE 
A BAD ERROR THERE PLENTY OF ROOM 
TO AVOID THE POCKET 
NOT A GOOD PACK FOR HIM HE HAS 
COME THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BLACK 
IT WOULD LIKE TO POT THE BLACK AND 
PLAY FOR THE RED BELOW THE BLACK 
SPOT 
BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED HE HAS BROUGHT 
FOUR REDS AND CAN ONE SHOT BROAD 
FOUR REDS AND IN ONE SHOT BROUGHT FOUR REDS OUT IN ONE SHOT 
THAT IS THE RED HE PLAYED FOR AT 
THE BACK OF THE PACK VERY CLEVER STUFF 
MARCO FU NEEDS TO START DOING 
SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY OTHERWISE 
DING JUNHUI WILL BE AWAY FROM HIM 
CRUCIAL TIMES FOR MARCO FU 
IMMINENT POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING 
THE LEAD TO FIVE TO ONE MARCO FU NEEDS TO KEEP HIM OUT MORE 
DING JUNHUI IS NOT STRIKING THE 
BALL AS WELL AS HE CAN BUT DUTY 
THE EFFICIENCY OF HIS CUE ACTION 
IT IS KEEPING HIM SCORING BIG 
BREAKS ANYWAY DUE TO THE 
EFFICIENCY 
HE IS TAKING HIS TIME HERE BECAUSE 
THERE IS LOT OF APPLAUSE COMING FROM THE OTHER TABLE 
THERE WILL BE SOME APPLAUSE FOR 
DING JUNHUI I THINK QUITE SOON 
IT SEEMS VERY LIKELY HE WILL CLINCH 
THE FRAME NOW AT THIS VISIT 
YES ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AT THEIR 
WITH THE PLAYERS WITH THE TWO 
TABLE SITUATION IS THAT WHEN THERE 
IS A BURST OF APPLAUSE YOU ARE 
NEVER QUITE SURE WHEN THE NEXT ONE 
IS COMING 
YOU CAN BE WAITING FOR IT AND 
SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT HAPPEN BUT 
WHEN IT COMES IT IS QUITE LOUD 
HE IS ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN 
THE WORLD AT SPLITTING THE BALLS 
AND MAKING BIG BREAKS HE IS UP 
THERE WITH THE BEST 
IT TOOK HIM AN HOUR AND A HALF TO 
BUILD UP A TWO TO ONE LEAD 
BUT HE IS ENGAGING THE HIGHER GEARS 
NOW 
AND A TRIO OF FRAME WINNERS ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN 
EIGHTY SEVEN AND THIS EFFORT WILL PUT HIM 
FOUR FRAMES CLEAR 
IT SEEMS LIKE THE THREE VISITS HAVE 
BEEN HIS FIRST CHANCE IN THREE 
FRAMES 
YOU DO NOT SEE A LOT OF THAT YOU 
CAN DO THE BIG BREAKS BUT WITH 
YOUR FIRST OPPORTUNITIES IT IS 
VERY SPECIAL 
HE WAS PRETTY STRAIGHT ON THAT 
BLACK 
THE BREAK ENDS ON NINETY NINE BUT IT TAKES 
HIM FIVE TO ONE AHEAD 
MY BEST PERFORMANCE 
WAS WINNING THE U. K. CHAMPIONSHIP 
RIGHT THROUGH THE TOURNAMENT FROM 
THE FIRST ROUND MATCH RIGHT THROUGH 
TO THE FINAL IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT 
BUT I REALLY ENJOYED IT 
FROM MY EARLIEST CHILDHOOD CHLOE 
LOVE TO WATCH RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
PLAYING HE WAS MY IDOL I LOVED 
HE ALWAYS SEEMED IN TOTAL CONTROL 
AT THE TABLE HE WAS VERY 
COMFORTABLE HE LOOKED SO RELAXED 
I WOULD LOVE TO BE SO RELAXED 
AROUND A SNOOKER TABLE 
FANS IN MAINLAND 
CHINA WERE DOUBTLESS FEELING GOOD 
ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF THEIR MAN 
BUT HONG KONG'S MARCO FU RESPONDED 
IN FRAME SEVEN AND HE IS AT TABLE 
AGAIN IN THE EIGHTH THE 
I THINK YOU CAN JUST SEE AN EDGE 
HERE YET AGAIN HE IS FORCED INTO 
ROLLING UP POSSIBLY INTO PLAYING 
A DEFENSIVE SAFETY SHOT 
I THINK HE WAS ASKING A LOT HE WAS 
TRAPPED REALLY THREE VERY GOOD 
SAFETY SHOT FROM MARCO FU AND THE 
THIRD ATTEMPT HE HAS FORCED AN 
OPENING 
HE WAS JUST TIGHTENING THIS GROUP 
ALL THE TIME IN THAT EXCHANGE 
THAT'S GROUP 
WHEN YOU LOOK A 
LITTLE BIT CLOSER AT THE TABLE THE 
BLACK SPOT IS NOT AVAILABLE 
SCREWS L. THINK IT IS CONGESTED IF 
HE TAKES PINK IT WILL TIE THE PINK 
UP 
WHAT LOOKED LIKE A GOOD CHANCE IS 
GOING TO TAKE A BIT OF WORK A LOT 
OF WORK BUT AT LEAST MARCO FU IS 
COMING TO THE TABLE FOLLOWING HIS 
SEVENTY EIGHT BREAK IN THE PREVIOUS FRAME 
WHICH WILL HAVE SETTLED HIM DOWN A 
LITTLE BIT HIS HIGHEST BREAK BY A 
LONG WAY SO FAR IN THE MATCH 
IF YOU HAVE A LOOK THROUGH MARCO FU 
POOL'S BACK MARCO FU'S STATS THIS 
SEASON IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS 
HE HAS BEEN CONVERTING A LOT OF 
CHANCES 
TWENTY NINE CENTURIES BY FU ON THE CHANCES CIRCUIT THIS SEASON THAT MUST BE 
IN THE TOP THREE 
IT IS NOT JUST 
THE CENTURIES TWENTY NINE IS VERY HIGH BUT 
IT IS THE FIVE THOUSAND BREAKS OF EIGHTY THAT 
HE HAS DONE THEY DON'T LOCK ALL 
THOSE LOG 
HIS SCORING HAS BEEN VERY GOOD 
LIKE ALL THE TOP PLAYERS THESE DAYS 
IF YOU DON'T SCORE YOU DON'T GET 
FAR 
THE EASIER RED IS THE ONE IN THE 
LEFT CORNER BUT THE ONE IN THE 
MIDDLE IS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT POT THE 
HE IS A FRACTION SHORT FOR THIS 
BLACK 
IT IS NOT BAD WITH THE BLACK THERE 
AT LEAST IT GIVES MARCO FU THE 
OPTION OF MAKING A SUBSTANTIAL 
BREAK HERE 
HE HAS GOT A CHANCE HERE TO BRING 
THE PINK INTO PLAY 
IF THE PINK IS AVAILABLE INTO THE 
LEFT CENTRE I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY 
HE DIDN'T PLAY THE EASIER SHOT 
THE OLD ADAGE AGAIN OF TWO 
HALVES IS APPROPRIATE HERE AFTER 
A VERY SCRAPPY GAME IN THE FIRST 
FOUR THE STANDARD HAS BEEN VERY 
HIGH IN THE SCORING 
EIGHT GAME IT IS WHAT YOU COME TO 
EXPECT FROM ASIA'S TOP TWO PLAYERS A GAME 
I'M NOT SURE IF HE HAS THE ANGLE TO 
PLAY FOR THE RED BELOW THE PINK 
HE IS TOO STRAIGHT HE HAS STILL 
GOT TWO REDS NEAR THE BLACK SPOT A 
BIT QUICKER THE QUICK YOU OPEN THE 
PINK SPOT UP IT WILL GO INTO THE 
FOUR POCKETS ON THE BOTTOM SIDE OF 
THE TABLE MUCH EASIER THEN IT 
GIVES YOU SO MANY MORE OPTIONS OF 
POSITION 
THAT IS PRETTY GOOD IT COULD HAVE 
GONE WRONG PLAYING FOR THE PINK 
AGAIN CHOICES ONE BACK INTO ONE 
INTO THE LEFT CENTRE ONE INTO THE 
LEFT CORNER L. DON'T THINK HE'S THAT IS PERFECT EITHER 
AFTER A LOT OF HARD WORK AND 
PRECISE CONTROL THIS IS FRAME BALL 
FOR FU 
SHOT SELECTION AND PRECISE 
POSITIONAL CONTROL HAVE BEEN THE 
HALLMARKS OF THIS BREAK FROM FU 
I REMEMBER EARLIER THIS YEAR ONE 
OF THE PLAYERS THAT LOST A MARCO FU 
SAID TO ME THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME 
TO THE TABLE HE SEEMED TO MAKE FIFTY 
I SAID WHAT OFF THE BREAK OFF 
BUT IT IS ENOUGH THAT THE OTHER 
PLAYER FEELS LIKE THAT 
HE HAS VERY GOOD CUE BALL CONTROL 
WHEN HE IS CLOSE IN 
NOW IT LOOKS AS IF HE IS GOING TO 
CONVERT THIS FINE EFFORT INTO A 
CENTURY INTERESTING CHOICE OF SHOT 
HE THOUGHT THAT THE BROWN WAS AN 
EASIER BALL FOR THE POSITION ON THE 
YELLOW TO MAKE A TOTAL CLEARANCE 
FU DIDN'T WANT TO STOP THAT ONE HUNDRED IT IS AMAZING SOMETIMES HOW THEY'RE 
GOING WHEN IT DOESN'T MATTER 
MARCO FU TRIALLED FIVE TO ONE BUT AFTER 
BREAKS OF SEVENTY EIGHT AND ONE HUNDRED THREE HE HAS 
REDUCED THAT TO FIVE TO THREE A HAZEL 
THE GRAND 
PRIX CHAMPION'S 
FIRST CENTURY ON THE BOARD IN THIS 
CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGN HE DID REACH THE SEMIS ONLY TWO 
YEARS AGO THIS IS THE LAST FRAME 
OF THE SESSION AND MARCO FU HAS EIGHTEEN 
TO MAKE EIGHTEEN POINTS TO MAKE 
THE RED ABOVE THE MIDDLE POCKET IS 
SAFE NOTHING TO STOP BEING HE JUNE 
WEEK PLAYING A SAFETY DING 
JUNHUI 
HE DID NOT GET TOO CLOSE TO THAT 
ONE THE PRESSURE IS REVERSED IT 
IS ON DING JUNHUI HE WAS FIVE TO ONE IN 
FRONT AND MARCO FU WAS UNDER HEAVY 
PRESSURE THE MATCH AND THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP WERE SLIPPING AWAY FOR 
MARCO FU BUT NOW IF MARCO SHOULD 
GET THIS FRAME IT WOULD FINISH FIVE TO FOUR 
AND DING JUNHUI WOULD BE VERY 
DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE OF FIVE TO 
ONE HE WAS LOOKING UNBEATABLE FIVE 
ONE 
HIS RECOVERY IN THIS SESSION HAS 
SHOWN NOT ONLY HIS SKILL BUT ALSO 
HIS RESILIENCE SWEET NOTHING I THINK 
THIS WAS NOT A PROBLEM IT WAS THE 
PREVIOUS SHOT THAT HE PLAYED THE 
RED HE 
HE TOOK ON THE 
RED HE POTTED BEFORE HE TOOK ON THE BLUE I THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING ON 
IT IS NEVER EASY TO SPLIT THE BLACK 
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING OFF TWO 
CUSHIONS 
I SUPPOSE AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU 
ONLY NEED TO BRING ONE OUT INTO 
PLAY GOOD STUFF 
NUDGING ANOTHER RED INTO A BETTER 
POSITION 
ANOTHER FRAME HAS PASSED BY ON THE 
OTHER TABLE AND THE CROWD SEEMED 
EXCITED IT IS VERY EASY NOT TO 
THINK OF THE PLAYERS ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE CRUCIBLE 
YES AFTER AN EXCITING FRAME THERE 
IS A GREAT TEMPTATION TO TALK ABOUT 
IT IF ALL OF THE SPECTATORS THERE 
TALK ALL AT ONCE THERE IS QUITE A 
HUBBUB A LITTLE TOO FAR 
HE DID NOT WANT TO BE BRIDGING 
AWKWARDLY 
THAT RED TO THE LEFT OF THE CUE 
BALL HE DID NOT WANT TO BRIDGE 
OVER THAT 
NICE ANGLE HE HAS PLAYED THAT 
RATHER WELL 
IT JUST CREATE ONE WONDERFUL 
ATMOSPHERE THE CRUCIBLE 
THERE COULD BE A LOT OF EXCITEMENT 
ON THIS SIDE AS WELL THOUGH THIS 
EVENING IF THIS MATCH GOES CLOSE 
INEVITABLY SPECTATORS GET MORE 
EXCITED WHEN THE WINNING POST IS IN 
SIGHT 
THE RED JUST BELOW THE PINK IS 
AVAILABLE INTO THE LEFT CORNER 
AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME IT 
LOOKS EASY WHEN THE PROFESSIONAL 
PLAYERS ARE PLAYING ON THE 
TELEVISION L. ALWAYS TELL THEM THE 
SAME THING DO NOT THINK IT IS 
EASY 
IT IS A TOUGH GAME TO PLAY HE DOES 
NOT LIKE THAT ONE HE WANTED TO 
FORCE THE CUE BALL ABOUT THREE 
INCHES MORE TO THE LEFT 
HE CAN STILL KISS THE RED THAT BUT 
IT IS NOT EASY TO GET AT THEM 
DETOUR LOOKED GOOD FOR DING JUNHUI 
AT FIVE TO ONE BUT IF MARCO FU COULD DROP 
THIS RED INTO THE MIDDLE AND AT 
THE BLUE HE WILL ONLY LEAD FIVE TO FOUR AT 
THE ADJOURNMENT 
THE FIRST THREE FRAMES WERE PRETTY 
TURGID THEY TOOK AN HOUR AND 
HALF THEY LEFT DING JUNHUI TWO TO ONE 
AHEAD BREAKS OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND NINETY NINE 
INCREASED HIS LEAD TO FIVE TO ONE BUT 
MARCO FU HAS COME BACK EQUALLY 
STRONGLY ATRIA OF FRAME WINNERS OF 
HIS OWN SEVENTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED THREE AND NOW THIS FINE 
EFFORT EIGHT TRIO OF FRAME WINNERS A TRIO 
A CLEARANCE WOULD GIVE HIM BACK TO 
BACK CENTURIES 
FROM FIVE TO ONE DOWN HE WILL BE DELIGHTED 
TO TRAIL ONLY FIVE TO FOUR 
HE FINISHES THE WON IT WITH BACK TO 
BACK CENTURIES ONE HUNDRED THREE AND ONE HUNDRED IT IS 
ALL TO PLAY FOR TONIGHT 
THERE HAVE BEEN NINETEEN CENTURIES 
ALREADY 
A VERY HIGH STANDARD THAT WE HAVE 
BEEN SEEING OVER THE OPENING DAYS 
IN THE FIRST ROUND DING JUNHUI 
GLEEDS FIVE TO FOUR BUT WHAT DID YOU MAKE 
OF THE WAY THAT MARCO FU HAS COME 
BACK 
SUPERB AND HE HAS REINFORCED BACK HIS STANDARD THROUGH THE YEAR 
TERRY GRIFFITHS HAS TURNED HIS GAME 
AROUND HE HAS BECOME A TRUE WIN 
AND CONTENDER 
HE KNOWS HE HAS THE 
EDGE IN TERMS OF WINS OVER DING 
JUNHUI DOES HE HAVE THE 
PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE 
IT DOES 
NOT HINDER HIM THEY MADE DING 
JUNHUI THE FAVOURITE BUT THIS IS 
TO CUT TOO CLOSE TO CALL FOR ME 
THEY ARE COMING BACK TONIGHT TO 
FINISH OFF LET'S REMIND YOU OF THE 
SITUATION ON TABLE TWO THE MATCH 
BETWEEN GRAEME DOTT AND JOE PERRY 
WE LEFT AT THREE TO THREE IT WENT TO FOUR TO FOUR AND 
HERE IS JOE PERRY MAKING IT THE 
LAST TO LEAD FIVE TO FOUR AFTER THEIR 
OPENING SESSION WE WILL BE BACK IN 
THE MORNING TO FINISH OFF 
GOOD TO SEE GRAEME DOTT IN THE MOOD 
TO COMPETE BECAUSE HE AND THE MAKE 
THE DECISION TO PLAY LATE LAST WEEK

SURPRISE EXIT FROM MR. S. MARK SELBY 
MR. MARK SELBY 
UNTIL THIS 
TOURNAMENT MARK KING DID NOT SHOW 
THE FORM REQUIRED BUT THE FIRST 
ROUND IS TOUGH HERE FOR ANY PLAYER 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE THE FAVOURITE 
A LOT OF PRESSURE AND HE 
SHOULDERED IT BEAUTIFULLY
