IT'S THE WINDOWS 
AND THERE'S ANIMALS MOVING IN UNUSUAL WAYS TODAY LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
THE SQUARE WINDOW 
LOOK AT THESE CHILDREN CLIMBING THEY USE THEIR HANDS AND FEET TO CLIMB 
THEY ARE CLIMBING UP REALLY HIGH 
BUT NOT AS HIGH AS THESE MOUNTAIN GOATS 
THEY CAN CLIMB RIGHT UP ROCKY CLIFFS TO THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS 
JUST LOOK AT HOW HIGH THESE GOATS HAVE MANAGED TO CLIMB 
LOTS OF OTHER ANIMALS CAN CLIMB AS WELL 
THIS REPTILE IS CALLED A GECKO 
IT HAS FLAT PADS ON ITS FEET TO HELP IT GRIP THE WALLS 
THIS GECKO IS WAITING NEXT TO A LIGHT ON THE WALL 
TO SEE IF IT CAN CATCH A NICE JUICY MOTH GOT ONE 
HERE'S AN ANIMAL YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CLIMB 
THIS BIRD IS CALLED A HOATZIN 
IT'S ALSO CALLED A STINKY BIRD BECAUSE IT CAN BE A BIT SMELLY 
BABY HOATZIN BIRDS ARE VERY UNUSUAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE LITTLE CLAWS 
THEY USE THESE CLAWS TO CLIMB 
THIS BABY HAS FALLEN DOWN INTO THE RIVER 
THOSE LITTLE CLAWS HELP IT TO GRIP SO IT CAN CLIMB BACK TO ITS NEST 
WHERE IT'S SAFE AND DRY 
THIS ANIMAL SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CLIMB AT ALL 
SNAKES DON'T HAVE ANY HANDS OR FEET TO CLING ON TO THE TREES WITH 
THEY USE THEIR WHOLE BODY TO CLIMB WITH INSTEAD 
SOME SNAKES ARE VERY GOOD CLIMBERS 
BUT THIS ANIMAL IS ONE OF THE BEST CLIMBERS OF ALL 
IT'S A SQUIRREL 
SQUIRRELS ARE BRILLIANT AT CLIMBING 
AND THEY WILL CLIMB ANYWHERE TO FIND THEIR FAVOURITE FOOD NUTS 
THIS GARDEN HAS A SPECIAL OBSTACLE COURSE 
TO SEE HOW GOOD SQUIRRELS REALLY ARE AT CLIMBING 
SHALL WE SEE HOW WELL THIS SQUIRREL CAN CLIMB 
AND SHE'S OFF 
AND ON TO THE WINDMILL 
IT'S A QUICK CLIMB ALONG THE CHAIN THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR 
AND A CLIMB THROUGH THE TUNNEL 
AND THE NUTS ARE IN SIGHT 
OVER THE ROLLERS AND A FINAL JUMP 
THEY WERE REALLY GOOD CLIMBERS 
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVOURITE MINE WAS S. S. S. S. SNAKE

ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE 
SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN 
I'VE GOT A BEANBAG HERE 
AND WE THROW THE BEANBAG ON TO ONE OF THE SQUARES LIKE THAT 
I THINK THAT'S A NUMBER SIX 
WE HOP ON THE SINGLE SQUARES 
AND WE JUMP ON THE SQUARES THAT ARE TOGETHER 
YOU HOP AROUND THE SQUARE THAT YOUR BEANBAG HAS LANDED ON 
MISS NUMBER SIX AND THEN TURN AROUND 
AND THEN WE COME BACK AGAIN 
THIS IS THE DIFFICULT PART 
WE HAVE TO BALANCE AND PICK UP THE BEANBAG AND WE HOP AND JUMP OFF

I WONDER WHAT NUMBER I'M GOING TO GET

YOU'RE GONNA COUNT WITH ME READY

ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED

THIS IS OUR FAVOURITE PLACE TO PLAY 
IT CHEERS US UP ON A RAINY DAY 
THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO HERE AND SEE

HOME TIME WE'VE HAD SO MUCH FUN 
SOCKS AND SHOES ON FOR EVERYONE 
WE CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK ANOTHER DAY 
FOR AN AFTERNOON OF COLOURFUL PLAY 
THAT LOOKED GREAT FUN THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO MOVE 
HOPPING JUMPING SKIPPING RUNNING 
I WONDER IF SOMEONE'S RUNNING IN TODAY'S STORY LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
TIKKABILLA TOCKABILLA 
TIKKABILLA TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
THE LONG HAND IS POINTING DOWN TO THE NUMBER SIX 
SO THAT MEANS IT'S HALF PAST SOMETHING 
AND THE SHORT HAND IS HALFWAY PAST THE NUMBER THREE 
SO THE CLOCK SAYS IT'S HALF PAST THREE 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
IT'S A PAIR OF RUNNING SHOES 
AND THIS STORY IS CALLED 
ZOOM 
HURRICANE KIERON AND RUSHAROUND RIA WERE BROTHER AND SISTER 
THEY WERE ALWAYS IN A HURRY THEY JUST COULD NOT KEEP STILL 
THEY NEVER WALKED ANYWHERE THEY ALWAYS RAN 
ZOOM ZIGGA ZIGGA ZIGGA ZIGGA 
THEY RAN TO THE BATHROOM IN THE MORNING WHEEEEEEE AAAAAAAAGH 
RAN FOR THEIR BREAKFAST CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP 
RAN FROM THEIR FRIENDS IN THE PARK HELP CAN'T CATCH ME 
RAN JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT YOW YOW YOW 
RAN UP THE STAIRS HUH HUH HUH RAN DOWN THE STAIRS WHOOPS 
RAN ON THE SPOT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT 
RAN ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND 
WHOOOOOOOOIWHEEEEEE 
THE TROUBLE WAS THEY ONLY STOPPED 
YAWN WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR BED PHEEEW 
COME THE MORNING THEY WOULD START ALL OVER AGAIN 
WHOOOOOOOOIWHEEEEEEE 
THEN ONE DAY 
HURRICANE KIERON FELL AND CUT HIS KNEE AND HE CRIED AND HE CRIED 
THEN HE STOPPED CRYING AND HE TRIED TO RUN AGAIN 
BUT HE COULDN'T BECAUSE IT HURT 
SO HE SAT DOWN AGAIN BUT RUSHAROUND RIA DIDN'T WAIT FOR HIM 
SHE JUST CARRIED ON RUNNING 
AND HE WATCHED AND HE WATCHED BUT HE COULDN'T JOIN IN 
AND RUSHAROUND RIA CARRIED ON WITHOUT HIM 
IT DIDN'T MATTER TO HER THAT HE COULDN'T JOIN IN OR NOT AT FIRST 
BUT THEN HURRICANE KIERON FOUND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO 
SOMETHING HE HAD TO SIT QUIETLY TO DO 
SOMETHING WHICH MEANT NO RUNNING AROUND 
SOMETHING HE HAD TO THINK ABOUT 
SO WHEN RUSHAROUND RIA RUSHED AROUND 
KIERON DID NOT NOTICE 
HE WAS TOO BUSY BUSY PAINTING PICTURES 
HURRICANE PICTURES 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO ZOOM TO MAKE A HURRICANE NOW 
ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS MIX THE PAINT 
AND HE COULD MAKE A ZOOOOOM ON THE PAPER 
RED AND BLUE AND ORANGE AND PURPLE AND YELLOW AND BROWN AND BLACK 
AND RUSHAROUND RIA KEPT RUSHING BACK TO SEE WHAT KIERON WAS UP TO 
THEN RIA TOOK THE PAINTBRUSH AND PAINTED A RUSH 
WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH 
SO WITH RUSHES AND HURRICANES 
THE PAPER GOT WETTER AND AFTER A FEW DAYS HURRICANE KIERON GOT BETTER 
NOW DID YOU NOTICE 
THAT THEY USED SMALL BRUSHES FOR THEIR PAINTINGS IN THE STORY 
WELL I AM GOING TO PAINT A HUGE PICTURE USING A REALLY BIG BRUSH 
RIGHT SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS WHAT I'M PAINTING 
I'M GOING TO START WITH SOME YELLOW 
OVER WE GO CAREFUL NOT TO SPILL IT
