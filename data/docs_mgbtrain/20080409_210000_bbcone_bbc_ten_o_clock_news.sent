IS NOT BOYCOTTING THE GAMES AND HE 
WILL BE THERE FOR THE CLOSING 
CEREMONY CEREMONY TONIGHT THE PROTESTS CONTINUE AS 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH MAKES ITS WAY 
THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO 
WE WILL HAVE THE LATEST FROM 
CALIFORNIA AND FROM BEIJING

BOARDED UP AS HER MOTHER APPEARS IN

OUT FROM THE BLOGGERS THEMSELVES 
GOOD EVENING GORDON BROWN WILL NOT 
BE ATTENDING THE OPENING CEREMONY 
OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN BEIJING 
NUMBER TEN INSISTED TONIGHT THIS 
WAS NOT A SNUB THE PRIME MINISTER 
WILL BE ATTENDING THE CLOSING 
CEREMONY AND BEING A BIT BATON WILL 
BE PASSED TO LONDON THE OLYMPIC 
COMMITTEE IS MEETING IN BEIJING 
TODAY TO DISCUSS THE GROWING 
WORLDWIDE PROTESTS ABOUT CHINA'S 
HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD FROM THERE 
OUR SPORTS EDITOR MIHIR BOSE SENT 
THIS REPORT 
GORDON BROWN'S DECISION NOT TO 
ATTEND THE OPENING CEREMONY IN 
BEIJING IS ENTIRELY IN KEEPING WITH 
HIS ATTITUDE TO CHINA'S OLYMPICS 
HE HAS TO DO HIS DUTY WITHOUT BEING 
SEEN AS A SUPPORTER SO HE WELCOMED 
THE TORCH OUTSIDE DOWNING STREET 
BEING CAREFUL NOT TO PHYSICALLY 
TOUCH IT AS WE CAN NOW SEE HE WAS 
ALSO PLAYING A VERY CAREFUL GAME 
WHEN HE SPOKE AFTER A RECENT 
MEETING WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT 
WE WILL NOT BE BOYCOTTING THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES BRITAIN WILL BE 
ATTENDING THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
CEREMONIES 
YOU MIGHT HAVE INFERRED CEREMONIES FROM THAT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER 
WOULD BE THERE HIMSELF BUT NOW IT 
EMERGES THAT HE WILL ONLY BE AT THE 
CLOSING CEREMONY BUT THEN BRITAIN 
NEEDS TO BE THERE ANYWAY AS LONDON 
TAKES OVER FROM BEIJING AS THE NEXT 
OLYMPIC CITY 
THE PROBLEM FOR GORDON BROWN IS 
THAT CHINA'S OF HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD 
AND THE PROTESTS THAT CONTINUES TO 
GENERATE ARE CASTING A LINGERING 
SHADOW OVER THE OLYMPICS AND THE 
CHINESE SEEM DETERMINED TO COMPLETE 
THE ILL FATED TORCH RELAY BY ANY 
MEANS NECESSARY 
IF 
THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS DURING THE 
TORCH RELAY FROM TIBET TO MOUNT 
EVEREST IF ANYBODY DARES TO CREATE 
TROUBLE WE WILL DEAL WITH THOSE 
PEOPLE SO DEARLY WE WILL NOT BE 
VISIBLE SO DEARLY 
GORDON BROWN IS NOT ALONE OVER AN 
AGONISING OVER HOW TO RESPOND TO 
THE PROTESTS THE INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE GATHERED IN THE 
CHINESE CAPITAL ARE ALSO WRESTLING 
WITH THEIR STRATEGY WITH THE CLOCK 
TICKING TO THE START OF THE GAMES 
I AM TOLD THAT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
SAYS INCREASING PRESSURE FOR A 
PUBLIC STATEMENT URGING CHINA TO 
SETTLE THE TIBET ISSUE PEACEFULLY 
IT IS HOPED THAT SUCH A MOVE WOULD 
SHOW THAT THE I. O. C. CARES ABOUT HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND HELP RESCUE THE IMAGE OF 
THE GAMES BUT GORDON BROWN AND THE 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE WANT TO GIVE THE 
IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE STRONG ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS BUT BEING 
INEXTRICABLY TIED TO THE BEIJING 
OLYMPICS THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO 
OFFEND CHINA 
LET'S GO LIVE TO BEIJING WHERE IT 
IS IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE 
MORNING WE HAVE THE WHITE HOUSE 
TODAY HINTING THAT PRESIDENT BUSH 
WAS HAVING GOOD LONG THINK ABOUT 
ATTENDING THE OPENING CEREMONY HOW 
CONCERNED ARE THE INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
REMEMBER THE 
OPENING CEREMONY IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT MOMENT IN ANY OLYMPIC 
GAMES IT DEFINES THE GAMES IT 
DEFINES THE COUNTRY IT IS THE 
MOMENT WHEN THE COUNTRY TELLS THE 
WORLD WHO IT IS WHERE IT HAS COME 
FROM AND WHY THE GAME'S IT IS 
HOSTING IS SO SPECIAL FOR GORDON 
BROWN NOT TO BE AT THE OPENING 
CEREMONY DESPITE THE FACT HE WILL 
BE AT THE CLOSING CEREMONY WILL BE 
SEEN AS A STATEMENT BY THE CHINESE 
A STATEMENT THEY MAY NOT VERY MUCH 
WELCOME AS FAR AS THE 
INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE IS 
CONCERNED MAKE NO MISTAKE THEY 
ARE STILL VERY PROUD OF THE FACT 
THAT THEY GAVE THE GAMES TO CHINA 
THE COUNTRY WITH THE LARGEST 
POPULATION IN THE WORLD FOR THEM 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY WANT TO 
MAKE A POWERFUL STATEMENT ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN 
THEY MAKE THIS STATEMENT WITHOUT 
OFFENDING CHINA AT THIS MOMENT 
THEY ARE AGONISING OVER HOW TO 
SQUARE THIS VERY DIFFICULT CIRCLE 
A FINAL THOUGHT ON GORDON BROWN 
HIS DECISION CLEARLY THAT CLOSING 
CEREMONY FOR BRITAIN IS ALL 
IMPORTANT GIVEN THE HANDOVER THAT 
HAPPENS 
ABSOLUTELY WHAT THAT HAPPENS EMPHASISES GORDON BROWN BEEN AT 
THE CLOSING CEREMONY IS THAT 
BEIJING AND LONDON ARE TIED 
TOGETHER THEY ARE LINKED TOGETHER 
LONDON SUCCEEDS BEIJING AS THE NEXT 
SUMMER OLYMPICS CITY LONDON CANNOT 
BE LIKE ANY OTHER CITY AND SAY WE 
ARE NOT GOING TO BE THERE IT HAS 
TO BE PASSED ON THE MAYOR OF 
LONDON WILL BE THERE AND THE PRIME 
MINISTER IS ARE THERE IF YOU LIKE 
AS A MATTER OF DUTY HE CAN 
DISTANCE HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAS TO 
BE THERE BUT HE IS NOT ENDORSING 
CHINA'S OF HUMAN RIGHTS

THAT THE TORCH HAS CHANGED ROUTE 
IT MIGHT HAVE FINISHED BUT IT 
MIGHT NOT COME THROUGH HERE

EMMANUELLE ALL FOUR DENY MURDER 
COMING UP THE RISING TIDE OF 
RUBBISH THAT IS POLLUTING BRITAIN'S 
BEACHES BEACHES TWO WEEKS AGO WE SHOWED YOU THE 
PLASTIC TIED OUT IN THE PACIFIC 
TONIGHT WE REVEAL THE EXTENT OF 
THE PROBLEM CLOSER TO HOME 
NOW THE LATEST WARNING THAT 
BRITAIN'S ECONOMY IS ENTERING ROUGH 
WATERS COMES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL 
MONETARY FUND IT PREDICTS THAT 
WORSENING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN 
AMERICA WILL AFFECT BRITAIN AND 
THAT GROWTH HERE WILL NOT BE 
MATCHING THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN 
FORECAST OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR 
STEPHANIE FLANDERS IS HERE WITH 
MORE DETAILS 
WELL THE BIG MESSAGE FROM THE I. M. F. 
IS THAT THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS GOING 
TO HAVE A MUCH LARGER IMPACT ON THE 
GLOBAL ECONOMY THAN IT THOUGHT JUST 
A FEW MONTHS AGO 
IN JANUARY IT THOUGHT THE DEVELOPED 
ECONOMIES WOULD GROW BY NINETEEN PER CENT 
TODAY THEY CUT THAT BY TO THIRTEEN PER CENT 
THAT IS MOSTLY DOWN TO WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED IN AMERICA WHERE THE PAIN 
IN THE HOUSING MARKET HAS SPREAD TO 
THE REST OF THE ECONOMY AT THE 
START OF THE YEAR THE I. M. F. STILL 
THOUGHT THE U. S. WOULD GROW BY FIFTEEN PER CENT 
THIS YEAR NOW THAT HAS BEEN 
SLASHED CONSUMERS ARE FEELING THE 
PINCH AT THIS ITALIAN FOOD CHAIN 
IN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE TRYING TO 
CATER FOR THEIR CLIENT'S SHRINKING 
WALLETS BY OFFERING CHEAPER HALF 
SIZED PORTIONS 
WHAT WE ARE DOING 
WITH THE HALF PORTIONS IS AFFORDING 
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR COUPLES WHO ARE 
WORKING TO FEEL LIKE THEY COULD 
STILL GO OUT A COUPLE OF TIMES A 
WEEK AND HAVE A GREAT MEAL 
WITHOUT GIVING THAT UP BECAUSE 
OF THE ECONOMY 
WITH ALL OF THE BAD 
NEWS THIS YEAR THE I. M. F. THINKS THE 
BEST THE U. S. CAN HOPE FOR IS A MILD 
RECESSION FOLLOWED BY A RECOVERY 
NEXT YEAR 
MOST OF THAT NEWS HAS 
BEEN BAD PARTICULARLY ABOUT U. S. 
CONSUMERS HOUSE PRICES ARE COMING 
DOWN WE SEE A WEAKENING JOB MARKET 
AND WE SEE THE CONSUMER REALLY 
UNDER PRESSURE ON A NUMBER OF 
FRONTS 
THE I. M. F. IS NOT EXPECTING FRONTS RECESSION HERE BUT HE DOES THINK 
THE GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY IS GOING 
TO SLOW TO SIXTEEN PER CENT THIS YEAR THE 
SLOWDOWN IS GOING TO LAST IT 
THINKS WE WILL GROW SIXTEEN PER CENT NEXT YEAR 
AS WELL THAT IS MUCH MORE DOWNBEAT 
THAN THE GOVERNMENT THE MID POINT 
OF ITS FORECAST FOR TWO THOUSAND NINE IS GROWTH 
OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
IF THE I. M. F. ARE RIGHT AND 
GROWTH IS AS LOW AS THEY THINK IT 
WILL BE UNEMPLOYMENT WILL PROBABLY 
BE RISING THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN 
THE ECONOMY WILL NOT BE INCREASING 
VERY FAST IT WILL FEEL VERY 
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE GOT 
USED TO OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS 
THINGS ALREADY FEEL VERY DIFFERENT 
FOR BRITAIN'S BANKS AND THE PEOPLE 
THAT THEY LEND TO THE CHANCELLOR 
SAYS THE CITY AND THE REST OF THE 
ECONOMY ARE WELL PLACED TO WEATHER 
THE STORM AND IT WILL BE OVER BY 
CHRISTMAS THE I. M. F. HAS NOW JOINED 
THE MANY WHO DISAGREE 
IT ALL ADDS TO THE PRESSURE ON THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND TO CUT INTEREST 
RATES FOR A THIRD TIME TOMORROW 
THE LONGER THE CREDIT CRUNCH TO 
CONTINUES THE MORE PEOPLE WONDER 
IF A SMALL CUT IN RATES IS GOING TO 
BE ENOUGH 
AN INQUEST HAS HEARD THAT SEVEN 
BRITISH SOLDIERS WERE SHOT IN BASRA 
LAST YEAR BY THE SAME SNIPER RIFLE 
THE SOLDIERS WERE SHOT IN SEPARATE 
ATTACKS ON THE STREETS OF BASRA 
OVER PERIOD OF SEVERAL MONTHS 
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE SAID IT WAS 
NOT POSSIBLE TO SAY THAT THE SAME 
PERSON HAD FIRED THE SHOTS THE 
CORONER NOTED THAT THE ARMY HAD 
BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE HIGHER 
LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR THE MEN 
THE AMOUNT OF LITTER ON OUR BEACHES 
IS PILING UP DESPITE ENDLESS 
APPEALS TO KEEP THE SEASIDE CLEAN 
THE RATE OF POLLUTION IS INCREASING 
SHARPLY ACCORDING TO LATEST 
RESEARCH THE MARINE CONSERVATION 
SOCIETY SAYS THE PLASTIC BAG IS BY 
FAR THE BIGGEST ENEMY OUR WEST OF 
ENGLAND CORRESPONDENT SENT THIS 
REPORT 
TWO HOURS AFTER HIGH TIDE AND 
WE'RE SEARCHING SAND BAY IN 
SOMERSET I'M HERE WITH THE MARINE 
CONSERVATION SOCIETY TO SEE HOW 
MUCH PLASTIC IS WASHED UP IT 
DOESN'T TAKE US LONG TO FILL OUR 
BIN BAG 
REMAINS OF COAT HANGER 
WHAT'S THAT A SHOT GUN CARTRIDGE I 
THINK BUT THIS IS THE BAG WE WERE 
HOPING TO FILL BUT JUST LOOK AT 
THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WE'VE MANAGED 
TO ACCUMULATE THIS HAS TAKEN TEN 
MINUTES OR SO AS YOU CAN SEE 
THERE'S MASSES OF RUBBISH OUT THERE 
ON THIS BEACH IT IS NOT JUST HERE 
THE SOCIETY DOES CHECKS LIKE THIS 
AROUND THE COAST OF BRITAIN EVERY 
YEAR AND THEIR LATEST STUDY SHOWS 
MORE LITTER THAN EVER BEFORE 
WITH THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC RISING 
BY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX PER CENT SINCE THE STUDIES BEGAN 
OVER A DECADE AGO 
IT IS SHOCKING 
AND IT IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE 
WE'VE ALL GOT TO TAKE SOME LEVEL OF 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS AT AN 
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL RIGHT THROUGH 
COMMUNITY LEVELS INDUSTRY RETAIL 
SECTOR TO HOW DO WE KNOW HOW 
LISTENING IT WILL LAST IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT IT COULD POTENTIALLY 
BE THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
TWO WEEKS AGO B. B. C. NEWS TRAVELLED 
TO MID WAY ISLAND IN THE PACIFIC TO 
SHOW THE IMPACT OF PLASTIC ON 
WILDLIFE LIKE THIS YOUNG ALBATROSS 
BUT HERE IN THE U. K. THERE ARE 
SIMILAR STORIES AT THIS SEAL 
SANCTUARY IN CORNWALL THEY'RE 
SEEING MORE AND MORE ANIMALS THAT 
HAVE BEEN HURT BY DEBRIS THIS ONE 
HAS A SCAR AROUND HER NECK SHE WAS 
ALMOST DECAPITATED BY DISCARDED 
FISHING NETS 
PLASTIC BAGS THEY 
MISTAKE FOR FOOD SO I FEAR A GREAT 
DEAL FOR MARINE LIFE AROUND 
CORNWALL AND THE U. K. 
HAD THIS IS A 
RUBBISH BIN CONSERVATIONISTS SAY 
THESE FIGURES SHOW THERE'S A NEED 
TO IMPROVE PLASTIC RECYCLING PLAID 
CYMRU HAS BEEN SETTING OUT ITS 
POLICIES FOR THE FORTHCOMING LOCAL 
ELECTIONNESS WALES THE PARTY'S
