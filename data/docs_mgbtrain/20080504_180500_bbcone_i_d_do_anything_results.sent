WRAPS WHICH I WAS VERY PLEASED TO 
SEE 
I WANT WANTED THE FIRST SONG SEE TO GO WITH A BANG L. THINK I TRIED 
TOO HARD 
MR. BOJANGLESS 
I FEEL YOU HAVE LIMITED RANGE 
OF EXPRESSION 
TOLD THAT STORY YOU 
HAD MULTIPLE EXPRESSIONS THEY 
WOULD BE SEEN FROM THE BACK OF THE 
STALLS NO DOUBT GREAT PERFORMANCE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THERE WAS A 
CRACK IN THE MIDDLE SOMETIMES 
EMOTIONAL CRACKING IS BETTER THAN 
PERFECTION 
YOU ARE A WONDERFUL PERFECTION PROFESSIONAL ACTRESS THAT WOULD 
ALWAYS KEEP THE CURTAIN UP 
IT WAS BRILLIANT FROM ANDREW 
I CAN HEAR THE SOUND OF VIOLINS 
LONG BEFORE IT BEGINS 
I CAN 
APPRECIATE IT IS VERY VERY 
DIFFICULT TO SING AND DANCE AT THE 
SAME TIME YOU HANDLED IT LIKE A 
TRUE PRO 
I ASKED YOU TO BE 
DELICIOUS YOU WERE 
THAT'S THE BEST RESULT I COULD HOPE 
FOR 
THERE IS NOT A STAR IN HEAVEN WE 
CAN'T REACH 
HARRY YOU ARE 
CHOSEN CHOSEN THE WAY YOU HOLD YOUR KNIFE 
THE WAY WE DANCED TIL THREE HUNDRED 
THAT NOD SAID IT ALL BABY I'M BACK 
A VERY INTELLIGENT AND BACK LYRICAL READING OF THAT GREAT SONG 
MY ONLY CONCERN IS YOUR AGE AND 
WHETHER YOUR VOICE IS QUITE STRONG 
ENOUGH 
THERE ISING IN SADDER THAN ENOUGH NUMBER 
THAT WAS THE PERFORMANCE OF 
THE SERIES I'M SPEECHLESS THE THE GREATEST PEFORMANCE I HAVE EVER 
HEARD A YOUNG GIRL OF YOUR AGE GIVE 
I WAS SO EXCITED TO BE ON STAGE AND 
BE MYSELF L. ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE 
OF IT 
HEY BIG SPENDER 
HEY BIG SPENDER JUST THE 
RIGHT AMOUNT OF SEXINESS AND 
CHEEKINESS REQUIRED 
I DIDN'T FEEL 
AS IF THE SAUCY LOOKS WORKED YOU YOU DID VERY WELL L. DON'T QUITE GET 
THAT FINAL CONNECTION WITH AN 
AUDIENCE YET 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I 
NEED TO DO TO PLEASE THESE PEOPLE 
WHAT A NIGHT SOME AMAZING 
PERFORMANCES YOU MAY REMEMBER LAST 
YEAR OUR JOSEPHS WERE STRUCK BY THE 
CURSE OF THE COAT WELL THIS YEAR 
OUR NANCYS COULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK 
BY THE CURSE OF BARRY HUMPHRIES 
WE THANK DAVID SUMMER FIELD FOR 
WRITING TO US SAYING BARRY MAY BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME SPOOKY GOINGS 
ON IN NANCY LAND LET'S SEE SHALL 
WE 
NANCYS BEWARE THE CURSE OF BARRY 
IT SEEMS IF HE SAYS YOU ARE NOT 
NANCY YOU ARE IN THE SING OFF IT 
BEGAN IN THE FIRST WEEK WHEN 
HUMPHREYS GOT THE HUMP WITH AMY 
WHO IS NOT NANCY AMY AMY AMY ENDED UP IN THE SING OFF HE 
HAS BEEN WORKING HIS WIZARDRY EVER 
SINCE 
KEISHA TARRIA FRANCESCA SINCE KEISHA

START PRACTISING THE SING OFF SONG 
YOUR LOCKET COULD BE HANGING BY A 
THREAD THREAD WOW NANCYS YOU BETTER WATCH OUT 
THERE IS A HUMPHREYS ABOUT 
BUT WILL HE BE RIGHT LATER OF 
COURSE THIS ISN'T JUST A SING 
COMPETITION OUR EVENTUAL WINNER 
HAS A GRITTY DRAMATIC ROLE TO PLAY 
NANCY WAS A LASS IN A TOUGH EAST 
END PUB WHO BETTER THAN BARBARA 
WINDSOR AND DENISE TO PUT THEM 
THROUGH THEIR PACES 
DENISE INVITED OUR NANCYS TO A 
PLACE FILLED WITH EAST END SPIRIT 
NO NOT WALFORD THIS IS THE 
ORIGINAL QUEEN VIC 
I THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO PUT YOU 
INTO A REAL ENVIRONMENT SOMEWHERE 
NANCY WOULD HANG OUT TO LIVE THE 
CHARACTER 
AND THIS IS THE CHARMING CHARACTER LANDLADY 
GET OUT OF MY PUB LANDLADY BARBARA WINDSOR 
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT BARBARA WINDSOR 
IS GOING TO BE HERE YOU HAVE TO UP 
YOUR GAME SHE IS AMAZING FIRST FIRST THEY NEED TO CONVINCE THE LOCALS 
THEY CAN PLAY A COCKNEY WITH SCENES 
FROM FINGS AIN'T WOT THEY USED T'BE

HE IS A FIGHTER 
AND IT IS YOUR 
PLACE 
IF EVERYONE KNOWS COCKNEY PLACE IT IS BAR BRA 
YOU WANT TO REMIND 
HIM O. I. YOU 
IT IS THAT KIND OF THING 
EAST END 
GIRLS ARE DOWN TO EARTH FEISTY 
SHE WOULD NEED TO BE TOUGH TAKE 
ANYTHING LIFE THROWS AT HER THEY THEY NEED TO FOCUS AND NAIL THE 
CHARACTER 
WE DON'T WANT TO BE CHARACTER RAIDED 
IF WE DO GET RAIDED WHO RAIDED WILL CARRY THE CAN 
WHAT ABOUT THAT 
TIME I TOOK YOU OUT ON A BENDER 
REMIND ME 
IF I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS 
SCOTTISH I WOULD LOOK AT HER AND 
THINK SHE WAS COCKNEY 
HIM THAT GOT 
TOPPED OFF 
YES SIRY HAS ALL THE 
EMOTION AND EVERYTHING BUT SHE 
PANICS TERRIBLY WITH THE ACCENT 
THEN IT IS TIME TO GET SERIOUS AS 
DENISE REALLY WANTS TO TEST THEIR 
ACTING WITH A TEARJERKING SCENE 
FROM BLOOD BRERS 
YOU ARE REALLY 
CLEVER 
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER SEE HIM CLEVER AGAIN L. JUST WANTED HIM TO HAVE A PICTURE 
JODIE'S PERFORMANCE WAS PICTURE GUTSY WHICH IS WHAT NANCY IS SHE SHE WAS ACTING IT FROM THE HEART BUT BUT WHAT IS THE POINT 
I STILL NEED TO 
SEE MORE GRIT FROM SAYERIA I'M NOT 
BELIEVING SHE IS AN EAST END GIRL 
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO TO 
ME YOU GAVE HIM THAT LOCKET 
SAMANTHA IMPRESSED ME SHE SEEMED
