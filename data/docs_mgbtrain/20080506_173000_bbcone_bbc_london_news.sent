HELLO NEW MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS 
JOHNSON HAS UNVEILED THE LINE UP OF 
SENIOR ADVISERS THAT WILL WORK 
ALONGSIDE HIM AT CITY HALL ON HIS 
FIRST FULL DAY IN OFFICE HE 
ANNOUNCED THOSE CHARGED WITH 
DELIVERING ON HIS ELECTION PROMISES 
AMONG THEM IS A FORMER PRISON 
GOVERNOR WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR TACKLING THE CAUSES OF YOUTH 
CRIME OUR POLITICAL EDITOR IS AT 
CITY HALL SO WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW 
ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON'S NEW 
ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATION TEAM BORIS AS IT IS BEING KNOWN 
HERE AT CITY HALL IS TAKING SHAPE 
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA NOW OF 
WHO WILL BE SITTING AT BORIS 
JOHNSON'S TOP TABLE THE ACTING 
CHIEF OF STAFF IS SOMEONE CALLED 
NICK KNOWLES FORMER DIRECTOR OF 
RACING TANK DIRECTOR OF A THINK 
TANK RAY LEWIS IS THE FORMER 
PRISON GOVERNOR AND YOUTH WORKER 
WHO WILL BE THE DEPUTY MAYOR FOR 
YOUNG PEOPLE WE WILL BE HEARING A 
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HIM IN JUST A 
MOMENT AND THEN THREE 
MOMENT AND THEN THREE APPOINTMENTS ANNOUNCED TODAY IAN 
CLEMENT CURRENTLY THE CONSERVATIVE 
LEADER OF BEXLEY COUNCIL HE WILL 
BE THE DEPUTY MAYOR IN CHARGE OF 
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND HIS KEY 
ROLE WILL BE LIAISING BETWEEN CITY 
HALL AND THE BOROUGHS NEXT THE 
FORMER DEPUTY OF WESTMINSTER 
COUNCIL THE DEPUTY MAYOR IN CHARGE 
OF POLICING AND THEN SIR SIMON 
MILTON WHO UNTIL TODAY WAS LEADER 
OF WESTMINSTER COUNCIL HE IS 
RESIGNING THAT POST AND HE WILL BE 
THE SENIOR ADVISER TO BORIS JOHNSON 
ON HOUSING AND PLANNING MATTERS 
AND THEN A RUMOUR THAT BILL BRATTON 
L. A. P. D. POLICE CHIEF MAY HAVE SOME 
KIND OF ROLE IN FUTURE ADVISING ON 
POLICING MATTERS AND IT IS 
POLICING AND CRIME THAT BORIS 
JOHNSON HAS BEEN STRESSING TODAY 
IN RELATION TO THE MAN HE HAS PUT 
IN CHARGE OF POLICY FOR YOU TODAY TODAY A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BOY IS IN A SERIOUS 
CONDITION IN HOSPITAL WITH STAB 
WOUNDS AND ON SATURDAY THIS YOUTH 
BECAME THE TWELFTH VICTIM OF THIS 
YEAR'S FATAL TREND HIS DEATH CAME 
JUST HOURS AFTER LONDONERS VOTED IN 
A NEW MAYOR AND TODAY WITNESSING 
A YOUTH PROJECT RUN WITH THE FLAIR 
PURVES HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT 
TACKLING YOUTH VIOLENCE FIRE 
SERVICE WOULD BE A TOP PRIORITY 
IT MEANS CHAMPIONING THEM SPEAKING 
UP FOR THE POLICE IT MEANS GIVING 
THEM THE SCANNERS TO DETECT THE 
KNIVES AND GUNS AND DOUBLING THE 
SAFER TRANSPORT TEAMS BUT ALSO IT 
MEANS WORKING WITH THE GROUPS LIKE 
THIS ONE HERE TODAY THAT ARE 
CHANGING THE LIVES OF KIDS AND 
GIVING THEM ENCOURAGEMENT AND 
ENTHUSIASM 
HE IS THE ENTHUSIASM CONSERVATIVES' FAVOURITE YOUTH 
WORKER RAY LEWIS A FORMER PRISON 
GOVERNOR AND CURRENTLY HEAD OF THE 
EASTSIDE YOUNG LEADERS ACADEMY NOW 
HE IS THE NEW DEPUTY MAYOR FOR 
YOUNG PEOPLE 
THE DEATH OF COMMUNITY THE 
COLLAPSE OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT 
SHAPED US AND GAVE US VALUES ALL 
OF THESE THINGS ARE DEAD OR DYING 
OUR MISSION IS RESTORING SOME OF 
THOSE THINGS SOME PEOPLE DO NOT 
EVEN KNOW WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO 
THEM UNLESS WE CAN RESTORE AND 
REPAIR OUR BROKEN COMMUNITIES ALL 
OF OUR EFFORTS WILL BE IN VAIN THE THE FOCUS IS SET TO BE HELPING 
VOLUNTARY GROUPS WITH MONEY FROM A 
NEW MAYOR'S FUND 
TIM WHAT ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON'S 
STYLE OF LEADERSHIP HOW DIFFERENT 
WILL IT BE 
THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE 
CHARM OFFENSIVE GOING ON HERE 
BORIS JOHNSON ADDRESSED SIX HUNDRED PLUS 
STAFF HERE AT CITY HALL THIS 
AFTERNOON CALL ME BORIS HE SAID 
DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD 
AND READ ABOUT ME L. AM NOT SOME 
NEOCON GLOBAL WARMING DENIAL HE 
WENT AND DID A TOUR OF THE BUILDING 
SHAKING HANDS AND MEETING PEOPLE 
SO CERTAINLY THE SIGNAL THEY WANT 
TO GIVE OUT IS THAT IT IS GOING TO 
BE A MORE OPEN ADMINISTRATION KEN 
LIVINGSTONE'S ADMINISTRATION WAS 
PERCEIVED TO BE TIGHTENED IT WITH 
A SMALL GROUP OF A RISE HAS AROUND 
HIM TIGHTER KNIT A SMALL 
GROUP OF ADVISERS 
BUT CERTAINLY AT THIS EARLY STAGE 
A DISTINCT CHANGE OF MOOD THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO OVER NOW TO 
OUR OLYMPIC CORRESPONDENT IN 
TRAFALGAR SQUARE WITH NEWS THAT 
LABOUR M. P. KATE HOEY WILL BE 
ADVISING THE MAYOR ON SPORT AND 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AN INTERESTING APPOINTMENT IN 
MANY WAYS CERTAINLY CERTAINLY CONTROVERSIAL GONE ARE THOSE HEADY 
DAYS OF PARTIES HERE LIKE WE HAVE 
HAD IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE IN THE PAST 
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF ARGUMENTS 
GOING ON I THINK ONE SEASONED 
OLYMPIC ADVERSE A OBSERVER SAID 
TO ME TONIGHT THAT THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE KATE 
HOEY WILL BE A BIT LIKE ONE OF 
THOSE IRRITATING WASPS THAT FLIES 
AROUND YOU ON A MIGHT LIKE THIS 
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE AN ICE 
CREAM DURING THE BID SHE WAS VERY 
VERY NEGATIVE AT ONE POINT SHE 
SAID PARRIS SHOULD WIN L. QUOTE I 
DON'T THINK WE ARE READY WE DON'T 
DESERVE IT SHE IS CERTAINLY NOT 
THE BEST BUDDY OF OLYMPICS MINISTER 
TESSA JOWELL 
IN WHICH CASE IT 
DOES NOT SOUND LIKE THE BEST START 
TO THEIR WORKING RELATIONSHIP L. 
WOULD LOVE TO BE A FLY ON THE WAR 
AND THOSE MEETINGS 
YOU HAVE GOT 
BORIS JOHNSON TESSA JOWELL 
OPPOSITE REMEMBER TESSA JOWELL 
WAS KEN LIVINGSTONE'S CAMPAIGN 
MANAGER YOU HAVE ALSO GOT THE BOA 
CHAIRMAN COLIN MOYNIHAN A FORMER 
TORY SPORTS MINISTER AND IN KATE 
HOEY AND YOU HAVE GOT LOADS OF 
SCOPE FOR SQUABBLING BUT I HAD A 
LONG CONVERSATION WITH KATE HOEY 
TONIGHT SHE SAYS SHE IS GOING TO 
PUT THE PAST BEHIND HER AND 
CONCENTRATE ON SPORTING LEGACY TO 
HER THAT'S WHAT REALLY MATTERS 
WHAT ABOUT THE MORE PRESSING 
OLYMPIC DECISION FACING THE NEW 
MAYOR 
I HAVE ALSO HEARD TONIGHT MAYOR THAT BORIS JOHNSON HAS GOT TO MAKE 
A VERY URGENT DECISION ABOUT THE 
OLYMPICS THE PARALYMPIC TORCH 
RELAY IS GOING TO COME HERE WARM 
AUGUST THIRTIETH AND HE AFTER ALL THE 
DEMONSTRATIONS WE HAD AROUND THE 
OLYMPICS HE HAS GOT TO DECIDE HOW 
TO ORGANISE THAT PARALYMPIC TORCH 
RELAY QUITE A TEST FOR HIM IN HIS 
FIRST FEW WEEKS IN OFFICE 
ONE OF THE KEY ELECTION 
BATTLEGROUNDS WAS LONDON'S 
TRANSPORT BORIS JOHNSON PROMISED 
TO BANISH BENDY BUSES FROM THE 
CAPITAL'S STREETS BRING BACK THE 
ROOST MASTER AND PREVENT STRIKES 
ON THE TUBE THE ROUTEMASTER IT 
WAS THE NEW MAYOR'S CAMPAIGN 
VEHICLE OF CHOICE AND PROMISING TO 
BRING THEM BACK HELPED HIM TO 
VICTORY WE GOT ON BOARD A 
ROUTEMASTER TODAY TO GAUGE 
REACTION TO THE CHANGES AHEAD 
FIRST STOP THE WESTERN EXTENSION 
OF THE CONGESTION CHARGING ZONE 
MAYOR JOHNSON HAS PROMISED 
CONSULTATION ON ITS FUTURE 
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF 
THE WESTERN EXTENSION AND PART OF 
OUR JOB NOW IS TO SEE THAT WHEN THE 
CONSULTATION COMES UP IT COVERS 
THE RIGHT AREA 
AND MANY WHO LIVE 
HERE ARE PLEASED 
I HOPE THE 
CONGESTION CHARGE WILL BE REVISED 
WE NEED A MAYOR THAT CAN LISTEN I I HOPE THAT HE IS GOING TO DO WHAT HE 
IS SAYING WHICH IS LOOKING AT THE 
ZONE AND THE CONGESTION CHARGE 
AND CONSULTING 
SECOND STOP CHELSEA SPIRITUAL 
HOME OF THE FOUR BY FOUR FROM OCTOBER THEY 
WERE DUE TO BE CHARGED TWENTY FIVE A DAY 
FOR THE CONGESTION CHARGE NOT ANY 
MORE IF BORIS HAS HIS WAY THAT 
HAS CONCERNED ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS 
IT INTRODUCES THE PRINCIPLE OF 
POLLUTER PAYS THOSE WHO PROMOTE 
MOST WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE IF HE 
DOES NOT DO THAT POLLUTE MOST 
THEN HE WILL HAVE TO SAY WHAT ELSE 
HE IS GOING TO DO TO TACKLE TRAFFIC 
AND CONGESTION 
WHAT ABOUT BRINGING 
BACK THE ROUTEMASTER INDUSTRY 
EXPERTS SAY HAVING AN OPEN DOOR 
LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
DUE TO FEARS OVER LITIGATION 
CRITICS SAY BRINGING IT BACK IS 
GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE AND ALSO 
PERHAPS IMPRACTICAL THE BENDY 
BUSES IS EXPECTED TO BE PHASED OUT 
BUT THERE IS NO DOUBTING MANY WOULD 
WELCOME THE RETURN OF THE 
ROUTEMASTER THE BENDY BUSES THE THE ROUTEMASTER WAS AN ICON OF LONDON 
MANY TOURISTS JOURNEY ON THEM ALL 
DAY LONG PEOPLE EXPECT TO SEE THEM 
EXPERTS NOW SAY FUNDING WILL BE THE 
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE 
THE KEY FOR 
BORIS IS HOW CAN HE WIN MORE FUNDS 
OUT OF THE TREASURY AND WHAT SORT 
OF RELATIONSHIP WILL BE MAYOR HAVE 
WITH THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT THAT 
WILL BE FASCINATING BECAUSE YOU 
CAN SEE THERE BEING QUITE A FEW 
DISPUTES TAKING PLACE BETWEEN CITY 
HALL AND WHITEHALL IMPLEMENTING IMPLEMENTING CHANGE WILL NOT BE EASY TODAY 
TUBE UNIONS AGAIN DISMISSED TALK OF 
A NO STRIKE DEAL ANOTHER PLEDGE 
THAT WILL NEED TO BE FULFILLED 
THERE IS PLENTY MORE TO COME 
INCLUDING AND NOISY POP CONCERT 
FEATURING LEONA LEWIS AND THE SUGAR 
BABES IT IS NOT EVERY NINETY YEAR 
OLD'S IDEA OF A GREAT PARTY L. WILL 
HAVE MORE ON NELSON MANDELA'S 
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS IN HYDE PARK 
THERE IS A MAJOR POLICE OPERATION 
GOING ON IN CHELSEA TONIGHT AFTER 
OFFICERS EXCHANGED FIRE WITH A 
GUNMAN IT HAPPENED JUST BEFORE FIVE 
O'CLOCK THIS EVENING OF THE KING'S 
ROAD SEVERAL STREETS HAVE BEEN 
CORDONED OFF NEAR THE TOWN HALL 
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US 
AS YOU CAN SEE I CANNOT GET ANY 
FURTHER THE WHOLE AREA HAS BEEN 
CORDONED OFF SINCE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THIS 
AFTERNOON A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC 
CALLED IN AFTER HEARING GUNFIRE 
ARMED POLICE SPECIALIST OFFICERS 
ATTENDED THEY WERE SHOT AT AND 
THEY RETURNED FIRE IT HAS BEEN 
CONFIRMED THERE HAVE BEEN NO 
ARRESTS AND NO ONE HAS BEEN 
INJURED BUT THE INCIDENT IS ON 
GOING A LITTLE EARLIER A MEMBER 
OF THE PUBLIC RANG IN TO OUR B. B. C. 
LONDON NINE HUNDRED FORTY NINE STATION AND THIS IS 
WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY 
THEY ARE SAYING MOVE BACK STAY 
IN THE SHOPS THEY WERE TELLING 
EVERYBODY TO STAY AWAY FROM THE 
WINDOW AND THEN I HEARD THREE 
GUNSHOTS I WASN'T SURE WHETHER IT 
WAS THE POLICE OR WHOEVER THEY WERE 
TRYING TO TAKE OUT OF THE HOUSE 
BASICALLY 
A LITTLE EARLIER I WAS ALSO 
SPEAKING TO A SHOPKEEPER JUST DOWN 
THE ROAD WHO SAID THAT HE HAD 
HEARD GUNSHOTS HE THOUGHT IT WAS A 
CAR BACKFIRING BUT HE DID NOT SEE 
THAT MUCH MORE AS YOU CAN SEE 
THERE ARE LOADS OF POLICE FUNDS 
HERE EVEN THE FIRE BRIGADE HAD 
TURNED UP AMBULANCE OVER THERE 
BUT LIKE I SAY NO ONE HAS BEEN 
INJURED AND THE INCIDENT IS STILL 
ONGOING 
THE ARMED FORCES REHABILITATION 
CENTRE IN SURREY IS TO GET TWENTY FOUR 
MILLION FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO 
UPGRADE ITS FACILITIES FOR WOUNDED 
SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN THE DEFENCE 
SECRETARY DES BROWNE CONFIRMED 
THE INVESTMENT WHEN HE VISITED 
HEADLEY COURT TODAY BUT QUESTIONS 
HAVE BEEN RAISED AS TO WHETHER IT 
IS ENOUGH 
NO ORDINARY GYM NO ORDINARY 
WORKOUT THE MORNING SESSION AT 
HEADLEY COURT IS VITAL FOR THE 
PATIENTS BEING TREATED HERE THE 
DEFENCE SECRETARY WENT TO MEET SOME 
OF THE SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN TRYING 
TO RECOVER FROM THEIR INJURIES HE 
INSISTED NEW GOVERNMENT MONEY WAS 
NOT A U. TURN BUT IT WAS THE RESULT 
OF A LONG TERM REVIEW OF CARE 
ESSENTIALLY TO UPGRADE AND IMPROVE 
AND EXTEND THE ACCOMMODATION TO 
BUILD UPON THE EXCELLENT PROSTATIC 
DEPARTMENT WE HAVE HERE WHICH IS 
WORLD CLASS AND TO IMPROVE THE 
QUALITY OF LIFE 
YET IT COMES 
ONLY AFTER CHARITIES STEPPED IN TO 
HELP FUND A NEW BIGGER SWIMMING 
POOL FOR PATIENTS WHICH HAS RAISED 
FIVE MILLION SO FAR THOSE BEING 
TREATED HERE HAVE NOTHING BUT 
PRAISE FOR HEADLEY COURT ITSELF 
IT'S A GREAT PLACE COMING HERE HAS 
GOT ME BACK FEET IT HAS GOT ME 
DRIVING AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS 
HAVE BEEN SORTED OUT FOR ME BACK 
ON MY FEET THEY HAVE ENSURED THAT 
MY NEW IF THAT MY NEW HOUSE IS 
FIT FOR ME TO LIVE IN 
THE EXTRA 
FUNDING SHOULD EXPAND THIS WORKSHOP 
FOR PROSTATIC LIMBS BUT THE MOTHER 
OF ONE BADLY WOUNDED PARATROOPER 
SAYS THE MONEY COMES TOO LATE 
WHILST HEADLEY COURT IS PUNCHING 
WAY ABOVE ITS WEIGHT ACHIEVING 
MIRACLES THIS AWARD IS NOW THE 
GOVERNMENT PLAYING CATCH UP TRYING 
TO PROVIDE FACILITIES WHICH SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE BRITAIN'S BRITAIN'S INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
IS UNLIKELY TO END SOON AND 
NEITHER WILL THE NEEDS OF BRITAIN'S 
INJURED TROOPS 
RUSH HOUR COMMUTERS ARE FACING 
SEVERE TRAVEL DISRUPTION TONIGHT 
DUE TO TRAIN DELAYS AT EUSTON SAINT 
PANCRAS AND LIVERPOOL STREET 
VIRGIN AND LONDON MIDLAND TRAINS 
OPERATING REDUCED SERVICES FROM 
EUSTON FOLLOWING SIGNAL FAILURES 
EARLIER TODAY PROBLEMS AT 
LIVERPOOL STREET HAVE RESULTED IN 
SOME CANCELLATIONS 
KEN LIVINGSTONE'S FORM ERASE 
ADVISER LEE JASPER 
DID 
ANYTHING WRONG WHEN HE WAS WORKING 
AT COUNTY HALL 
SPEAKING EXCLUSIVELY TO B. B. C. LONDON 
NINETY FOUR POINT NINE HE ADMITTED THE ROW OVER HIS 
ROLE MAY HAVE COST HIS BOSS VOTES 
IN LAST WEEK'S ELECTION DURING THE 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN HE MADE NO 
COMMENT BUT NOW LEE JASPER WHO 
RESIGNED HIS POST SIX WEEKS AGO 
AMID ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE USE OF 
PUBLIC FUNDS HAS HAD HIS SAY ON 
B. B. C. LONDON'S DRIVE TIME SHOW FIRST 
HE ADMITTED THE AFFAIR MAY HAVE HAD 
SOME INFLUENCE ON THE ELECTION 
OUTCOME 
I THOUGHT IT WASN'T A OUTCOME DECISIVE AND CRITICAL FACTOR L. 
DIDN'T SAY IT DIDN'T AFFECT WHAT 
WENT ON OF COURSE IT WOULD YOU 
CANNOT HAVE TWENTY WEEKS OF A CONSTANT 
AND RELENTLESS ATTACK BY THE 
EVENING STANDARD MAKING 
ALLEGATIONS THEY WERE WITHOUT IT 
HAVING SOME EFFECT THE QUESTION IS 
WHETHER IT HAD A DETERMINING EFFECT 
THESE ARE THE FILES RELATING TO 
FILES GIVEN BY THE LONDON 
DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO COMMUNITY 
GROUPS ONE OF THEM BRIXTON BASE 
RECEIVED ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TODAY LEE 
JASPER INSISTED HE HAD DONE NOTHING 
WRONG AND POINTED OUT THE POLICE 
INVESTIGATION HAD PRODUCED NO 
PROSECUTIONS 
MY MISTAKE WAS PROSECUTIONS THROUGH VIGOROUS ENTHUSIASTIC IN 
IMPLEMENTING MAYORAL POLICY IF YOU 
SAY HAVE I TRANSSENDED SOME RULE 
ABOUT YOU KNOW UNDERMINING OR 
OVERRIDING THE NORMAL RULES WHICH 
APPLY TO THE GOVERNANCE OF THOSE 
INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS T. ANSWER HAS TO 
BE NO 
LEE JASPER QUIT AFTER A LEAK 
OF FLIRTATIOUS E. MAILS SENT TO A 
WOMAN WHO RAN ONE OF THE PROJECTS 
TODAY HE DENIED THAT WAS WHY HE 
RESIGNED ALSO DENIED ANY CLOSE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER 
WE WEREN'T 
HAVING A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WE 
HAD BANTER BETWEEN FRIENDS WHO WERE 
THIRTY OBAN TER BETWEEN FRIENDS OF THIRTY 
YEARS 
WHAT 
DID YOUR WIFE SAY SHE YEARS SHE DID NOT REGARD IT AS APPROPRIATE 
BANTER AND GAVE ME HARD TIME FOR IT TONIGHT SCOTLAND 
SAID IT THERE HAD BEEN NO DEVELOPMENT IN 
THE INVESTIGATION OF COURSE WHAT 
MATTERS IS THE OUTCOME 
COMING UP WHY LONDONER'S HELP IS 
NEEDED TO KEEP THESE LIFE SAVERS 
AFLOAT AFLOAT AND I'LL BE FINDING OUT WHY WE 
COULD ALL SOON GIVE THE THUMBS UP 
TO ROBOTS IN THE HOME 
THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT 
NELSON MANDELA IS TO MAKE A RARE 
APPEARANCE IN LONDON JOINED BY 
SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN POP 
DAME SHIRLEY BASSEY ANNIE LENNOX 
AND SIMPLE MINDS WILL BE PERFORMING 
IN A CONCERT TO MARK HIS NINETIETH 
BIRTHDAY IT WILL BE STAGED IN A 
PARK WHERE CATHERINE IS FOR US 
TONIGHT TONIGHT ON TWENTY SEVENTH JUNE THE PARADE GROUND 
HERE IN HYDE PARK WILL BE 
TRANSFORMED INTO A CONCERT VENUE 
AS WELL AS THE STARS PERFORMING ON 
STAGE WE CAN EXPECT BILL CLINTON 
LOUIS HAMILTON TO BE IN THE CROWD 
OF COURSE THE GUEST OF HONOUR WILL 
BE THE BIRTHDAY BOY HIMSELF NELSON 
MANDELA ON WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY 
COULD BE HIS LAST TRIP TO THE U. K. 
AMY WINEHOUSE QUEEN RAZORLIGHT 
IT IS QUITE A LINE UP FOR A NINETIETH 
BIRTHDAY THOSE WHO TOOK PART IN 
THE FREE MANDELA CONCERT AT WEMBLEY 
TWENTY YEARS AGO SAY THEY ARE OVERJOYED 
TO BE BACK ON STAGE THIS TIME IN 
CELEBRATION 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME CELEBRATION AND MANY OF MY GENERATION 
PARTICULARLY WHO LOCK ON MANDELA AS 
A VERY SPECIAL HUMAN BEING THAT HE 
IS THE CURRENT CONCERT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT IS VERY MUCH A 
CHARITY CONCERT BUT BACK THEN IT 
WAS A POLITICAL CONCERT IT WAS A 
PROTEST CAN CERT MANDELA HIMSELF 
WAS STILL ON IN ROBIN ISLAND HAD 
NOT BEEN SEEN FOR TWENTY YEARS 
BUT EVEN THOSE TOO YOUNG TO 
REMEMBER NELSON MANDELA'S BLEAKER 
YEARS HAVE SIGNED UP IN THEIR 
DROVES 
THE STORY OF MANDELA AND DROVES THE PEOPLE THAT HE IS A SYMBOL FOR 
I THINK THEY TRANSCEND GENERATIONS 
SO THE FACT THAT LEONA LEWIS WHO 
IS CURRENTLY HOT TO TROT WOULD 
CURRENTLY DROP WHAT SHE IS DOING 
AND WOULD WANT TO BE THERE SPEAKS 
VOLUMES 
NELSON MANDELA WOULD BE VOLUMES FORGIVEN FOR WANTING A QUIET NINETIETH 
BIRTHDAY BUT HE MADE A BARGAIN HE 
TRAVELLED TO LONDON FOR HIS PARTY 
AS LONG AS IT RAISED FUNDS NOR HIS 
AIDS CHARITY NOW THE ARTISTS ARE 
PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS 
IT IS 
MANDELA IT IS HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY 
YOU CANNOT HAVE A BIRTHDAY PARTY 
WITHOUT MUSIC IT IS AN HONOUR TO 
BE ASKED TO PLAY 
WELL NELSON 
MANDELA IS DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THIS CONCERT RAISES THE 
PROFILE OF HIS OWN CHARITY IT IS 
KNOWN AS FORTY SIX SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THAT IS THE NUMBER 
OF THE TICKETS WHICH WILL GO ON 
SALE IT WOULD NOT BE A BIRTHDAY 
PARTY WITHOUT SOME BIG SURPRISES 
THERE ARE SOME BIG NAMED ACTS WHO 
WILL APPEAR ON THE DAY 
NOW I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE 
WOULD SAY NO TO A LITTLE HELP 
AROUND THE HOUSE WELL HOW ABOUT 
THE ROBOTIC KIND SCIENTISTS ARE 
PREDICTING SOME FORM WILL BE 
AVAILABLE WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE 
CURIOUS WE ARE LOOKED AT THE 
LATEST TECHNOLOGY AT THE DANA 
CENTRE IN THE SCIENCE MUSEUM WELL 
IT IS NOT KERRY'S USUAL DANCE 
PARTNER THIS ROBOT RESPONDS AND 
REACTING MAKING UP ITS OWN ROUTINE 
IT IS THE CLOSEST WE ARE TO 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE NO WONDER 
SHE LOOKS WEARY THIS ROBOTIC HAND 
DESIGNED BY A LONDON COMPANY IS 
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PROGRESS THIS 
KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY 
PUSHING THE FRONTIERS IN SPACE AND 
MEDICINE BUT IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT 
GOING INTO SPACE OR COMPLICATED 
SURGERY EXPERTS THINK WITHIN ABOUT 
TEN YEARS WE COULD ALL HAVE SOME 
ROBOTIC HELP AROUND THE HOME NICE 
TO MEET YOU 
THE INITIAL 
APPLICATIONS WILL BE FOR DISABLED 
AND ELDERLY PEOPLE TO HELP THEM DO 
SIMPLE DAILY TASKS WE ALL TAKE FOR 
GRANTED THE END GOAL IS THE SHADOW 
ROBOT SOMETHING WHICH FOLLOWS YOU 
AROUND AND DOES THE TASKS YOU MIGHT 
NOT WANT TO DO 
WHICH SOUND GREAT 
IN THEORY BUT COULD HAVE 
IMPLICATIONS FOR UNSKILLED WORKER 
TS ARE ROBOT BTSS ABOUT TO OVER 
ARE ROBOTS ABOUT TO OVERTAKE 
MANKIND 
WE LET THE INTERNET TAKE MANKIND US BY SURPRISE ONE OF MY JOBS IS 
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ETHICAL 
IMPLICATIONS OF ROBOTICS INSIDE 
CHILDCARE AND ELDER CARE THESE THESE ARMS ARE SLAVES OF MEN THIS THIS FOOTAGE FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SHOWS THE 
IDEAS ARE NOT EXACTLY NEW IN THE 
PAST FORTY YEARS WE HAVE COME A LONG 
WAY THE NEXT FORTY COULD BE JUST AS 
EXCITING EXCITING NOW THEY SAVE HUNDREDS OF LIVES IN 
THE CAPITAL EVERY YEAR DESPITE 
REGULARLY BEING CALLED UPON TO RISK 
THEIR OWN TO SAVE OTHERS THE RNLI 
GETS NO MONEY FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
NOW THE ROYAL NATIONAL LIFEBOAT 
INSTITUTION IS LAUNCHING A PUBLIC 
APPEAL FOR CASH 
A BOAT GETS INTO REAL TROUBLE ON 
THE THAMES IT IS CARRYING BUTANE 
GAS AND NINE PASSENGERS WHEN THIS 
HAPPENS HAPPENS WHAT DO YOU CALL WELL IT WOULD NOT 
BE A WINE MERCHANT FROM SHEPHERD'S 
BUSH IN MOST CASES AT LEAST BUT 
RICHARD HAS ANOTHER PASTIME AT AT WEEKENDS AND SOMETIMES IN THE 
NIGHTS I GO AND I'M A VOLUNTEER 
LIFEBOATMAN AT CHISWICK LIFEBOAT 
HOUSE DOWN ON THE THAIPLTS THIS IS 
WHAT THEY DO ON THE THAMES THIS THIS IS WHAT THEY DO NO GOVERNMENT 
FUNDING HERE THEY RELY ON 
DONATIONS LIKE THOSE IN NINETY PER CENT OF 
THIS JOB HE IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL 
IT IS VERY MUCH EMBEDDED IN THE 
SIGH I CAN PSYCH KI OF THE BRITISH 
PUBLIC THEY RESPOND WELL TO US 
HAVE FELT MORE APPRECIATED IN THE 
PAST YEAR THAN I HAVE IN ALMOST ANY 
OTHER JOB THAT I HAVE DONE THE THE RNLI HAS FOUR STATIONS ALONG THE 
RIVER YOU HAVE TEDDINGTON 
CHISWICK AND BY WATERLOO AND 
TOWARDS GRAVESEND THEY SAY THEY 
ARE ESSENTIAL THEY HOUSEBOATS LIKE 
THESE ON AVERAGE THEY SAVE AT 
LEAST ONE LIFE EVERY SINGLE DAY 
THE RNLI WERE CALLED OUT MORE THAN 
FIVE HUNDRED TIMES LAST YEAR THEY SAY THEY 
NEED YOUR DONATIONS TO STAY AFLOAT 
AND KEEP OFFERING A SERVICE AND 
THEY ARE USING THIS WEEK LONDON 
LIFEBOAT WEEK TO HIGHLIGHT IT WE WE ACTUALLY HAVE NO GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
WHATSOEVER THE ROYAL NATIONAL 
LIFEBOAT INSTITUTIONS RELIES ON 
CONTRIBUTIONS AND LEGACY IT IS 
VITAL WE GET FUNDS FROM THE PUBLIC 
THE ORGANISATION IS KEEN TO POINT 
OUT THIS IS MORE THAN ONE MAN AND 
HIS DOG OPERATION MANY ARE MEMBERS 
OF THE PUBLIC BUT ARE TRAINED TO A 
HIGH STANDARDS THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO 
KEEP PAYING UP 
O. K. PETE IS IN HYDE PARK HOPEFULLY WITH NEWS OF MORE SUNSHINE

SPRING AND ARE STRAIGHT INTO SUMMER

ME TOUCH RUGBY UP TOWARDS 
SPEAKER'S CORNER PEOPLE IN 
DECKCHAIRS ENJOYING ICE CREAM THE 
REST OF THE WEEK WILL NOT CHANGE

NORTH SEA THAT HIGH WILL KEEP ANY 
WEATHER FRONT ANY RAIN BARING 
CLOUD WELL TO THE WEST OF US WARM 
SUNSHINE DURING THE DAY EVEN THE 
NIGHTS ARE GOING TO BE WARM THE

CELSIUS FOR MOST OF US TOMORROW 
THERE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF
