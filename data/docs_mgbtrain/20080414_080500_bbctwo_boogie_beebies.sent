TODAY MUST BE MY LUCKY DAY 
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DRIVE A DIGGER 
THIS DIGGER IS CALLED AN EXCAVATOR 
THAT'S QUITE A BIG NAME 
BUT THEN I SUPPOSE IF YOU WERE AS BIG AS THIS DIGGER 
YOU'D HAVE A BIG NAME TOO 
SOME DIGGERS HAVE WHEELS 
BUT THIS EXCAVATOR MOVES ON TRACKS 
THESE TRACKS ARE GREAT FOR GRIPPING 
AND IT STOPS THE EXCAVATOR FROM GETTING STUCK IN THE MUD 
NOW ALTHOUGH IT'S A VERY HEAVY MACHINE 
IT'S SURPRISINGLY EASY TO STEER 
AND THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR FIRST MOVE 
EXCAVATOR MAKE SOME TRACKS 
LET'S TRY IT TOGETHER 
PUT YOUR ARMS OUT IN FRONT OF YOU LIKE YOU'RE THE EXCAVATOR 
AND THEN SWIVEL TO THE SIDE 
AND SWIVEL BACK 
SWIVEL TO THE SIDE AGAIN 
AND SWIVEL BACK 
EXCAVATOR MAKE SOME TRACKS 
SO WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST MOVE 
BUT WE NOW NEED ANOTHER MOVE 
HMM 
WHOA THAT'S JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR 
YOU SEE THOSE LEVERS 
WELL THEY MOVE FORWARD AND BACK 
FORWARD AND BACK 
AND THAT'S IN OUR SONG TOO 
PUT YOUR HANDS AT THE SIDE LIKE THEY'RE THE LEVERS 
AND THEN MOVE THEM FORWARD AND BACK 
FORWARD AND BACK 
FORWARD AND BACK 
COME ON YOU TRY IT WITH ME 
FORWARD AND BACK 
AND WHEN WE MOVE THE LEVERS FORWARD AND BACK 
IT OPERATES THE DIGGING ARM 
AND ON THE END OF THE DIGGING ARM 
CHECK IT OUT 
THERE'S A HUGE BUCKET 
AND THIS IS GREAT FOR WHEN WE WANT TO DO LOADS OF DIGGING 
SO LET'S MAKE OUR ARMS INTO THE SHAPE OF THE BUCKET 
AND THEN DIG IT 
DIG IT 
DIG IT 
DIG IT 
WE CAN DO SLOW MOVES WHEN WE WANT TO MOVE BIG PILES OF MUD 
AND SMALLER QUICKER ONES 
WHEN WE WANT TO DIG DEEP DOWN 
DIGGA DIGGA DIGGA DIGGA DIG DIG 
DIG IT DIG IT 
SO LET'S PUT ALL OF THE MOVES WE'VE GOT TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
