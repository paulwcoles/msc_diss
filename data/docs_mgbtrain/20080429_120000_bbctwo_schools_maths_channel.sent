THE CHANNEL YOU CAN COUNT ON 
WE CAN SEE THAT THESE PEOPLE ENJOY EATING ICE CREAM 
BUT THEY DON'T ALL SEEM TO LIKE THE SAME FLAVOUR 
HOW COULD WE FIND OUT WHAT FLAVOUR MOST PEOPLE ENJOY 
AND WHAT MIGHT BE THE LEAST FAVOURITE FLAVOUR WELL 
WE COULD TRY ASKING THEM A QUESTION 
EXCUSE ME HELLO DO YOU LIKE ICE CREAM I LOVE ICE CREAM 
EXCUSE ME DO YOU LIKE ICE CREAM I LOVE ICE CREAM YEAH 
WAS THAT THE RIGHT QUESTION TO ASK 
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THIS PERSON'S FAVOURITE FLAVOUR 
NO ALL WE KNOW IS THAT THEY LIKE ICE CREAM 
NOT WHAT THEIR FAVOURITE FLAVOUR IS 
WE NEED TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO GET THE RIGHT DATA 
THE FACTS THE USEFUL FACTS THAT WILL TELL US WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW 
WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE ICE CREAM MY FAVOURITE IS CHOCOLATE 
VANILLA MINE'S CHOCOLATE 
STRAWBERRY HAS TO BE TOFFEE 
WHAT ABOUT YOURS STRAWBERRY AND CREAM 
MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP 
WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE ICE CREAM CHOCOLATE CHIP MINT 
STRAWBERRY 
VANILLA 
IF YOU'VE GOT A TRICKY PROBLEM 
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
IF YOU ASK THE PROPER QUESTIONS 
THEN THE DATA WILL HELP YOU WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE ICE CREAM 
STRAWBERRY THERE'S REALLY NOT A BETTER WAY 
THAN FINDING OUT THE DATA WAY 
YOU CAN DO THE JOB TODAY 
COLLECT THE DATA STRAIGHT AWAY 
THE CHILDREN HAVE THE DATA FACTS ABOUT PEOPLE'S FAVOURITE ICE CREAM 
BUT IT'S ALL IN A MUDDLE 
IT'S STILL DIFFICULT TO CLEARLY SEE WHAT FLAVOUR MOST PEOPLE PREFER 
THE DATA HAS GOT TO BE SORTED OUT 
EACH ONE OF THESE CARDS IS GOING TO BE A VOTE FOR A TYPE OF ICE CREAM 
IF SOMEONE VOTED FOR MINT CHOC CHIP 
YOU PLACE ONE ICE CREAM CARD IN THE MINT CHOC CHIP PILE 
SO NOW THE CHILDREN ARE BEGINNING TO SORT THEIR DATA 
I HAVE A FEW SAYING MINT CHOC CHIP AND I'VE GOT SOME FOR CHOCOLATE 
I'VE GOT SOME FOR VANILLA 
WELL WE'VE GOT ALL THE VOTES FOR THE DIFFERENT ICE CREAM FLAVOURS 
IN THEIR OWN DIFFERENT PILES 
BUT IT STILL ISN'T EASY TO SEE WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR 
IF THEY PUT THE CARDS IN COLUMNS 
IT WILL BE EASIER TO SEE WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR 
AND THE LEAST POPULAR FLAVOUR 
ARRANGING THINGS LIKE THIS IS CALLED A BLOCK GRAPH 
AND NOW WE CAN REALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON 
I CAN SEE THAT MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP IS MORE POPULAR THAN STRAWBERRY 
STRAWBERRY HAS THE SAME NUMBER AS CHOCOLATE 
BUT LOOK WHAT GOT THE MOST NUMBER OF VOTES 
MINT CHOC CHIP 
WHICH FLAVOUR IS THE LEAST POPULAR 
CREAM TEA HAS THE LEAST NUMBER 
AND IS THE LEAST POPULAR ICE CREAM 
WE CAN SORT AND ORGANISE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
FOR EXAMPLE LOAVES OF BREAD SOLD IN A BAKERY 
PEOPLE'S FAVOURITE COLOUR PAINT AND THE MOST COMMON SHOE SIZE 
BUT WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD FIND THIS INFORMATION REALLY USEFUL 
AND WHY WOULD IT BE USEFUL TO THEM 
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WANT SO I KNOW HOW MANY LOAVES TO BAKE 
WHITE LOAVES ARE MORE POPULAR 
IF I BAKE TOO MANY THEY'LL GO TO WASTE 
IF I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MY CUSTOMERS WILL BE DISAPPOINTED 
ROBINSON CRUSOE HAS JUST LANDED ON A DESERT ISLAND 
AFTER HIS SHIP SANK IN A STORM 
THE ISLAND IS HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM ANYWHERE 
AND ROBINSON WILL HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME TO BE RESCUED 
IN FACT A SHIP ONLY PASSES THIS WAY ONCE EVERY YEAR 
HE DOESN'T HAVE A PENCIL AND PAPER OR A CALENDAR 
SO HOW WILL HE KNOW HOW LONG HE'S BEEN ON THE ISLAND 
HE DECIDES TO RECORD THE DAYS BY MAKING A MARK 
FOR EVERY DAY THAT HE SPENDS ON THE ISLAND 
BUT NOW HE'S MADE SO MANY MARKS 
IT'S NOT AS EASY TO TELL EXACTLY HOW LONG HE'S BEEN THERE 
HOW CAN HE MAKE IT EASIER TO SEE HOW LONG HE'S BEEN ON THE ISLAND 
HE'S THOUGHT OF A WAY 
BY GROUPING TOGETHER NEAT SETS OF FIVE MARKS 
IT'S MUCH EASIER TO COUNT LOTS OF DAYS 
AND NOW ROBINSON IS ABLE TO TELL WHEN A WHOLE YEAR HAS PASSED 
HE'S ORGANISED THE DATA 
AND HERE'S THE SHIP TO RESCUE ROBINSON BANG ON TIME 
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT DOGS ARE THE MOST POPULAR PETS 
BUT ARE THEY 
HOW COULD WE PROVE THAT THIS IS A FACT 
THAT DOGS ARE INDEED THE MOST POPULAR PETS 
WELL BY ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND ORGANISING THE DATA 
THAT'S THE INFORMATION WE GET FROM THE ANSWERS 
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT WE ARE EITHER RIGHT OR WRONG 
TO SAY DOGS ARE THE MOST POPULAR 
THESE CHILDREN ARE WELL ORGANISED 
THEY'VE WRITTEN DOWN THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE PETS 
THEY THOUGHT MIGHT BE POPULAR IN A TABLE 
THEN ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS TO PUT A TICK IN THE CORRECT ROW 
EXCUSE ME WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE PET MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS A DOG 
MY FAVOURITE PET IS A LITTLE FISH 
MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS A CAT FISH GUINEA PIG 
AN IGUANA WHAT 
YEAH WHY NOT REALLY 
IF THEY GET A MORE UNUSUAL PET THEY JUST WRITE THE NAME DOWN 
AND GIVE IT A TICK 
BACK AT THE PET SHOP IT'S TIME TO PUT ALL THE DATA TOGETHER 
IF YOU'VE GOT A TRICKY PROBLEM 
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
IF YOU SORT THE DATA 
THE DATA WILL HELP YOU 
THE CHART IS GETTING TOO BIG 
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF PETS THAT ONLY GOT ONE VOTE 
SO WE CAN PUT ALL THEIR VOTES TOGETHER AS OTHER PETS 
THERE'S REALLY NOT A BETTER WAY 
THAN FINDING OUT THE DATA WAY 
SO SORT THE DATA STRAIGHT AWAY 
THE TICKS ARE A BIT HARD TO SEE CLEARLY 
SO THE CHILDREN HAVE DECIDED TO CHANGE EACH TICK TO A SMILEY FACE 
EVERY SMILEY FACE REPRESENTS ONE PERSON 
AND THEIR VOTE FOR A FAVOURITE PET 
IF YOU'VE GOT A TRICKY PROBLEM 
AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
IF YOU SHOW THE DATA WELL 
THE DATA WILL HELP YOU 
THERE'S REALLY NOT A BETTER WAY 
THAN FINDING OUT THE DATA WAY 
YOU CAN DO THE JOB TODAY 
SHOW THE DATA STRAIGHT AWAY 
SO WHAT'S THE DATA ON PEOPLE'S FAVOURITE PETS 
WELL THE MOST POPULAR PETS WERE IN FACT CATS NOT DOGS 
AS WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT 
DOGS WERE THE SECOND MOST POPULAR 
WHICH TWO WERE EQUALLY POPULAR 
FISH AND HAMSTERS 
SO THE INFORMATION COLLECTED HERE AND DISPLAYED ON THE CHART 
PROVES THAT AMONGST THE PEOPLE WE QUESTIONED 
CATS NOT DOGS ARE THE MOST POPULAR PET 
THE PEOPLE QUESTIONED ABOUT PETS WERE MAINLY GROWN UPS 
DO YOU THINK WE'D GET THE SAME ANSWERS IF WE QUESTIONED CHILDREN 
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU COULD TRY FOR YOURSELF 
EXCUSE ME WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE PET
