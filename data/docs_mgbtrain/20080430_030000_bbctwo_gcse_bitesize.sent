HELLO AND WELCOME TO GCSE BITESIZE 
THE SERIES TO GIVE YOU THE EDGE WHEN SITTING YOUR GCSE EXAMS 
THIS IS THE SECOND OF TWO PROGRAMMES FOR YOUR DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY GCSE 
YOU REALLY NEED TO WATCH BOTH PROGRAMMES 
FOR THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED FOR YOUR OPTION 
THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR PRODUCT DESIGN AS ITS SYLLABUS 
COVERS ALL AREAS OF DESIGN 
THIS IS D. AND AMP T. TWO AND YOU CAN USE IT 
TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR COURSE WORK AS WELL AS YOUR WRITTEN EXAM 
YOU CAN EITHER PLAY THE PROGRAMMES IN BITESIZE CHUNKS 
OR IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO FOR IT YOU CAN TACKLE THEM IN ONE GO 
THERE'S A CLOCK IN THE CORNER TO HELP YOU FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH THEM 
YOU CAN GO TO THE BITESIZE WEBSITE WHERE YOU'LL FIND MORE HELP 
THE KEY CONTENT FOR YOUR SYLLABUS 
GRAPHICS TO HELP YOU WITH DIFFICULT CONCEPTS 
AND TESTS TO CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE 
THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME WE'LL GIVE YOU EXERCISES TO HAVE A GO AT 
HAVE A PEN AND PAPER HANDY AND PAUSE THE PROGRAMME 
WHEN YOU SEE THIS SIGN 
FINALLY WATCH OUT FOR OUR CHECKLISTS 
THESE SHOULD GIVE YOU A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT 
AND IF YOU FOLLOW THEM CAREFULLY HELP YOU TO IMPROVE YOUR GRADE 
IN DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY 
ALL THE FOCUS AREAS ARE ASSESSED ON TWO FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS 
DESIGNING AND MAKING YOU'LL NEED TO APPLY AND UNDERSTAND BOTH 
WHETHER MAKING A CAKE BUILDING AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT 
OR ANSWERING A QUESTION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT COURSEWORK 
COUNTS FOR THE LARGEST CHUNK OF YOUR MARKS SIXTY PER CENT 
AND YOUR MARK DEPENDS ON HOW WELL YOU CAN DESIGN AND MAKE A PRODUCT 
A WRITTEN EXAM MAKES UP THE REST OF THE MARKS 
YOU'LL BE TESTED ON 
THESE PROGRAMMES WORK TOGETHER 
SO WATCH BOTH PROGRAMMES AS YOU'LL BENEFIT FROM A BROAD AWARENESS 
OF ALL THE FOCUS AREAS 
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN D. AND AMP T. ONE NOW'S THE TIME TO WATCH IT 
BEFORE WE GET GOING 
IF YOU HAVE SEEN IT AND YOUR OPTION AREA HAS BEEN COVERED 
YOU STILL NEED TO WATCH THIS PROGRAMME 
AS IT COVERS NEW SKILLS AND CONCEPTS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT 
AND THE CASE STUDIES WE'LL SHOW YOU OFFER REAL LIFE SOLUTIONS 
TO INSPIRE YOU FOR YOUR OWN DESIGN CHALLENGES 
HERE'S A TASTE OF WHAT'S COMING UP 
THIS PROGRAMME LOOKS AT THE FOCUS AREAS 
FIRST RESISTANT MATERIALS 
THERE ARE THREE MAIN GROUPS OF RESISTANT MATERIALS 
EACH GROUP INCLUDES DIFFERENT MATERIALS 
ALL WITH DISTINCT PROPERTIES 
WHEN DESIGNING YOU SHOULD USE THE BEST MATERIAL 
OR COMBINATION OF MATERIALS FOR THE PRODUCT 
IN THIS SECTION WE'LL LOOK AT MECHANISMS 
DEVICES FOR TRANSMITTING FORCE AND MOTION 
THESE ARE ALSO RELEVANT TO THOSE STUDYING SYSTEMS AND CONTROL 
WHEN YOU'RE SELECTING A MATERIAL FOR A PRODUCT 
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ITS SIZE AND FORM 
WHAT STANDARD SIZES AND SHAPES ARE MANUFACTURED 
THE COST IS IT THE CHEAPEST OPTION 
A MATERIAL'S AVAILABILITY YOU CAN'T MASS PRODUCE A PRODUCT 
THAT'S MADE FROM MATERIALS THAT ARE SCARCE 
ANY HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES DURING THE PRODUCT'S MANUFACTURE 
WHEN IT'S USED OR EVEN HOW IT'S DISPOSED OF 
FINALLY A MATERIAL'S WORKING PROPERTIES 
WHAT SPECIAL QUALITIES ARE REQUIRED 
A MATERIAL'S WORKING PROPERTIES 
ARE WHAT MAKES IT SUITABLE FOR PARTICULAR PRODUCTS 
THESE INCLUDE HARDNESS THE ABILITY TO RESIST WEAR 
SCRATCHING AND INDENTATION 
ITS PLASTICITY THE ABILITY OF A MATERIAL 
TO PERMANENTLY CHANGE SHAPE 
THE STRENGTH OF A MATERIAL 
WHETHER IT CAN WITHSTAND FORCE WITHOUT BREAKING OR BENDING 
IF IT IS CONDUCTIVE CAN IT CONDUCT HEAT OR ELECTRICAL ENERGY 
ITS MALLEABILITY 
ABILITY TO DEFORM IN ALL DIRECTIONS WITHOUT BREAKING 
WHETHER IT'S DUCTILE CAN BE DEFORMED BY STRETCHING 
HOW TOUGH IT IS WILL IT WITHSTAND BLOWS OR SUDDEN SHOCKS 
OR HOW DURABLE IS IT RESISTANT TO WEAR AND WEATHERING 
DOES IT HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF FUSIBILITY 
CAN IT BE EASILY TURNED INTO A LIQUID OR MOLTEN STATE 
WHAT'S ITS ELASTICITY ITS ABILITY TO BEND THEN RETURN 
INTO ITS ORIGINAL STATE 
FINALLY YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT ITS APPEARANCE 
GO TO THE RESISTANT MATERIALS SECTION ON THE BITESIZE WEBSITE 
FOR MORE INFORMATION ON ALL OF THESE PROPERTIES 
WE'LL LOOK AT THE PROPERTIES OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES 
OF RESISTANTMATERIALS INDIVIDUALLY 
BUT YOU COULD CHOOSE TO DESIGN A PRODUCT 
THAT INVOLVES A COMBINATION OF MATERIALS 
SO FIRST WOODS ALSO KNOWN AS TIMBER 
THERE ARE TWO MAIN KINDS OF WOODS OR TIMBER 
HARDWOODS COME FROM BROAD LEAVED DECIDUOUS TREES 
WHICH ARE FRUIT OR NUT BEARING THEY'RE ALSO SLOW GROWING 
THIS PRODUCES A CLOSE GRAINED TIMBER THAT IS STRONG AND HARD 
BUT ALSO EXPENSIVE 
FOR EXAMPLE OAK BEECH AND ASH 
THE OTHER TYPE OF WOOD IS SOFTWOOD WHICH COMES FROM CONIFEROUS TREES 
THESE ARE FAST GROWING NEEDLE LEAVED AND CONE BEARING 
THEY PRODUCE OPEN GRAINED TIMBER 
WHICH IS LESS STRONG AND SPLITS MORE EASILY 
THEY'RE LESS EXPENSIVE COMMON EXAMPLES ARE SCOTS PINE 
AND THE WESTERN RED CEDAR 
THERE ARE ALSO MANUFACTURED BOARDS 
THESE HAVE NO NATURAL GRAIN 
WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T WARP AND TWIST LIKE NATURAL TIMBERS 
THEY ALSO COME IN LARGE SIZES AND ARE THE MOST AFFORDABLE 
EXAMPLES ARE MEDIUM DENSITY FIBREBOARD AND CHIPBOARD 
YOU'LL FIND MORE EXAMPLES ON THE WEBSITE 
WOOD AND COMPOSITES VARY FROM ONE KIND TO ANOTHER ACCORDING TO 
IN GENERAL THOUGH HARDWOOD IS THE HARDEST TO WORK WITH 
BUT IT'S ALSO THE MOST DURABLE AND GIVES THE FINEST FINISH 
SOFTWOOD TENDS TO BE EASIER TO WORK WITH 
BUT IT'S LESS DURABLE AND GIVES A CHEAPER FINISH 
MANUFACTURED BOARDS ARE NORMALLY EASY TO WORK WITH 
BUT CAN BE LESS DURABLE AND SOMETIMES GIVE A VARIABLE FINISH 
YOU'LL NEED TO BE ABLE TO NAME EXAMPLES 
OF THESE THREE TYPES OF WOOD 
SPECIFYING THEIR PARTICULAR WORKING PROPERTIES 
BUT BE CAREFUL IT'S NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS 
BALSA WOOD IS FROM A DECIDUOUS TREE 
SO IT'S A HARDWOOD EVEN THOUGH IT IS VERY SOFT 
WOODS CAN BE USED TO MAKE PRACTICALLY ANYTHING 
FROM MONOPLANES TO FURNITURE 
THIS CLIP DESCRIBES THE STAGES 
IN THE BUILDING OF A PIECE OF FURNITURE 
WHILE YOU WATCH MAKE NOTES ON THE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT 
YOU SEE BEING USED AND THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES INVOLVED 
LOOK OUT FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS 
THIS IS ERCOL 
A LONG ESTABLISHED PRODUCER OF QUALITY FURNITURE 
TODAY THE FACTORY BATCH PRODUCES TWO HUNDRED PIECES A WEEK 
THE WOOD ARRIVES FROM THE U. S. A. ALREADY CUT INTO STANDARD SECTIONS 
A COMPUTER NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED C. N. C. ROUTER 
IS PROGRAMMED BY COMPUTER TO CUT OUT THE SHAPE OF EACH PIECE 
THIS IS A TYPE OF CAM COMPUTER AIDED MANUFACTURE 
SO AT THE PRESS OF A BUTTON 
THIS MACHINE PRECISELY CUTS THE TIMBER 
INTO A FIXED SIZE WITH ANY GROOVES AND RECESSES 
ONCE THE MACHINE IS ON NO ONE CAN CROSS THE YELLOW MARKERS 
A VACUUM BED USES SUCTION TO HOLD THE WOOD IN PLACE 
ALSO FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY 
THERE'S THE PLASTIC GUARD AND FRINGE THESE PROTECT THE OPERATOR 
FROM DRILLS AND SAWS AS WELL AS FLYING DEBRIS 
A POWERFUL DUST EXTRACTOR SUCKS AWAY ALL THE SAWDUST 
THIS GOES TO HEAT THE FACTORY ALONGSIDE ANY WOOD OFF CUTS 
SO ELM TIMBER IS MACHINED INTO THE CENTRAL LEAVES OF A TABLE 
OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE 
MORE ELM IS TRANSFORMED INTO ITS MATCHING TABLE ENDS 
ASSEMBLY IS THE LABOUR INTENSIVE PART OF THE PROCESS 
THE HINGES FIT INTO PRE CUT HOLES 
AND ARE SCREWED IN BY HAND HELD ELECTRIC SCREWDRIVERS 
THE TABLE ENDS HAVE TO BE SANDED DOWN 
TO PERFECT THEIR EDGES 
POWERFUL AIR SUCTION DRAWS OFF ANY DUST 
ONCE THEY'VE BEEN CHECKED THEY'RE READY TO MOVE ON 
ALTERNATE HOLES ARE GLUED WITH P. V. A. 
THEN DOWEL PINS ARE PLACED INSIDE 
THEY HAVE CHAMFER TIPS TO EASE THE JOINING OF THE TABLE SECTIONS 
SO THE AIR CAN ESCAPE 
SANDING ALONG THE GRAIN 
WITH A CORK BLOCK AND GLASSPAPER REMOVES SHARP EDGES 
A DRILLING JIG SHOWS THE OPERATOR WHERE TO DRILL THE PILOT HOLES 
FOR THE LATER ATTACHMENT OF THE TABLE'S SUB FRAME 
NEXT THE TABLE RUNNERS ARE SELECTED 
IT'S ESSENTIAL THEY'RE NOT WARPED OR TWISTED 
COUNTERSUNK SCREWS ARE INSERTED INTO COUNTERBORED HOLES 
FOR POCKET SCREWING WHICH HOLD THESE IN PLACE 
FINE ADJUSTMENTS MAKE SURE THE RUNNERS 
SLIDE SMOOTHLY INTO THEIR GROOVES 
THE TWO TABLE ENDS JOIN THE CENTRAL PART TO BE SANDED AGAIN 
BECAUSE OF ALL THE NOISY MACHINERY MOST OPERATORS WEAR EAR PROTECTION 
AND RUBBER SOLED BOOTS OR SHOES TO PREVENT THEM FROM SLIPPING 
SANDING WITH A VERY FINE ABRASIVE ENSURES A QUALITY SMOOTH 
AND EVEN SURFACE ACROSS THE WHOLE TABLE 
NOW IT'S READY FOR THE FINISHING PROCESS 
A PIGMENT FREE DYE IS SPRAYED ONTO THE WOOD 
THIS DARKENS IT AND ALSO EMPHASISES THE GRAIN 
IT THEN TRUNDLES THROUGH AN OVEN FOR SEVEN MINUTES 
THE HEATING ELEMENTS SWITCH ON AND OFF WHICH REGULATES THE TEMPERATURE 
STOPPING THE OVEN OVER HEATING 
EXCESS DYE IS SANDED AWAY 
AND ITS COLOUR IS FIXED 
A CLEAR SPRAY LACQUER SEALS THE TIMBER 
AND GIVES A HARD COATING PROTECTING THE TABLE FROM LATER SPILLAGES 
LASTLY IT'S GIVEN A RUB WITH WIRE WOOL AND POLISHED UP WITH WAX 
THE TABLE IS READY FOR SALE 
IN THE PREVIOUS CLIP YOU SAW AN ELM HARDWOOD TABLE BEING PRODUCED 
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF BATCH PRODUCTION 
THE TABLETOP WAS PRODUCED USING PRE PROGRAMMABLE ROUTERS 
TO CUT THE TABLETOP TO SHAPE PRECISION DRILL AND CUT 
ALL THE HOLES REBATES AND RECESSES READY FOR ASSEMBLY 
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF COMPUTER AIDED MANUFACTURE CAM 
DURING THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS THE TABLE WAS PUT TOGETHER 
USING DOWEL JOINTS AND WOOD SCREWS 
RUNNERS AND GROOVES WERE USED TO FIT THE MOVING PARTS 
FINALLY THE SURFACE WAS SANDED USING A POWERFUL SANDING MACHINE 
BEFORE HAVING THE FINAL FINISH APPLIED 
THROUGHOUT THIS COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING PROCESS 
HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WERE TAKEN INCLUDING 
QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY OFTEN COME UP IN THE EXAM 
HAVE A GO AT THIS ONE 
THE KEY SAFETY MEASURES ERCOL TOOK TO PROTECT THE OPERATOR WERE 
FOR YOUR COURSEWORK AND EXAM 
YOU NEED TO SHOW AN UNDERSTANDING 
OF SOME SIMPLE CONSTRUCTION PROCESSES IN WOOD 
SUCH AS MAKING A MORTISE AND TENON JOINT 
MORTISE AND TENON JOINTS ARE FREQUENTLY USED 
IN FRAME AND FURNITURE CONSTRUCTION 
AS IT'S ONE OF THE STRONGEST JOINTS IN WOODWORK 
HERE'S A HAUNCH MORTISE AND TENON JOINT 
DRAW A QUICK SKETCH OF THE JOINT 
YOU SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO DRAW SOME OTHER COMMON JOINTS 
THIS IS A DOVETAIL JOINT USED IN A BOX CONSTRUCTION 
AND THIS IS A HOUSING JOINT NOTICE THE TRENCH GOES ACROSS THE GRAIN 
IT'S USED IN BOX OR FRAME CONSTRUCTIONS 
OTHER JOINTS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ARE 
YOU'LL NEED TO STATE THEIR ADVANTAGES AND THEIR DISADVANTAGES 
GO TO THE WEBSITE FOR MORE ABOUT PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY JOINTS 
LIKE KNOCK DOWN FIXINGS 
NOW FOR METALS 
THERE ARE THREE MAIN TYPES OF METAL 
FERROUS WHICH CONTAIN IRON 
NON FERROUS WHICH DON'T 
AND ALLOYS WHICH ARE MADE OF A MIXTURE OF METALS 
AS FERROUS METALS CONTAIN IRON THEY ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO CORROSION 
THE MOST COMMONLY USED ARE CAST IRON 
STRONG UNDER COMPRESSION BUT BRITTLE 
THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF STEEL 
THESE INCLUDE 
TOOL STEEL IS A HIGH CARBON STEEL AND IS STRONG HEAVY AND HARD 
STAINLESS STEEL IS POPULAR AS IT IS RESISTANT TO WEAR AND CORROSION 
UNUSUAL FOR A FERROUS METAL 
NON FERROUS METALS CONTAIN NO IRON 
AND ARE NORMALLY RESISTANT TO CORROSION 
COMMON EXAMPLES ARE ALUMINIUM WHICH IS GREY AND VERY LIGHTWEIGHT 
COPPER WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT CONDUCTOR 
BUT ALSO DUCTILE AND MALLEABLE 
SILVER AND GOLD ARE BOTH MALLEABLE AND DUCTILE LIKE COPPER 
LEAD IS SOFT AND MALLEABLE TOO 
BUT HEAVY UNLIKE COPPER SILVER AND ALUMINIUM 
AS ALLOYS ARE MIXTURES THEY CAN BE ADAPTED 
TO PROVIDE THE PROPERTIES REQUIRED 
BRONZE IS BOTH HARD AND RESISTANT TO CORROSION 
BRASS IS ALSO HARD BUT VERY YELLOW IN COLOUR 
PEWTER IS SOFTER LIGHTER AND VERY EASILY CAST 
COMING UP IS A CLIP WHICH SHOWS HOW A WINE RACK MADE FROM METAL WIRE 
WAS DEVELOPED AND CONSTRUCTED 
MAKE NOTES ON THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRODUCT 
AND THE PROCESS USED TO DEVELOP THE PRODUCT 
THEN THE TECHNIQUES USED IN ITS MANUFACTURING 
TAKE CARE TO NOTE ALL THE STAGES OF THE FINISHING PROCESS 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE 
ABOUT WIRE IS THAT YOU CAN PICK IT UP YOU CAN BEND IT 
AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO GET AN INSTANT RESULT 
TO SEE WHETHER YOUR DESIGN 
WILL WORK OR NOT 
THE IDEA OF WIREWORKS PRODUCTS IS TO PRODUCE WELL DESIGNED PRODUCTS 
THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT OF FRESH AIR IN THE MARKETPLACE 
AND ARE AFFORDABLY PRICED 
ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS THE EIGHT BOTTLE WINE RACK 
IS A WALL MOUNTED WINE RACK 
WHEN I STARTED DESIGNING THIS WINE RACK 
I SAT DOWN WITH A BLANK PIECE OF PAPER 
I WASN'T SURE HOW THE FINAL PRODUCT WOULD TURN OUT 
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID WAS TO RESEARCH EXISTING WINE RACKS 
IN THE DEPARTMENT STORES 
I FOUND THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY WINE RACKS WHICH COULD BE WALL MOUNTED 
I FELT THAT EIGHT WAS A GOOD SIZE TO PUT ON YOUR WALL 
I KNEW THAT TWO THINGS HAD TO HAPPEN WITH IT IT HAD TO FIT ON THE WALL 
AND IT HAD TO HOLD THE WINE BOTTLES IN SUCH A WAY 
THAT THE CORK DIDN'T DRY OUT 
THEN I STARTED PLAYING AROUND WITH THE WINE BOTTLE 
PUTTING WIRE ROUND IT AND SUSPENDING THE BOTTLE DIFFERENTLY 
UNTIL I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH THE DESIGN 
YOU CAN FORM WIRE IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS 
BUT IT HAS ITS RESTRICTIONS 
IT'S QUITE HARD TO CONTROL 
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE RAW MATERIAL IS MADE 
IT HAS LOTS OF TWISTS AND TURNS IN IT 
PRECISION WORK IN WIRE DOESN'T REALLY WORK 
YOU'RE ASKING THE MATERIAL TO DO SOMETHING IT DOESN'T WANT TO DO 
HAVING SAID THAT YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY TURN IT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
AND REALLY MANIPULATE IT A LOT TO CREATE QUITE INTERESTING SHAPES 
THE COMPONENTS ON THE BOTTLE RACK ARE PUT TOGETHER USING SPOT WELDING 
SOMETIMES THE EDGES OF THE SPOT WELD ARE SHARP 
AND THESE HAVE TO BE PRESSED OUT 
THE EIGHT BOTTLE WINE RACK IS PRODUCED 
USING FAIRLY LOW TECH MACHINERY 
THE COMPONENTS ARE ALL FORMED ON HAND OPERATED BENDERS 
THEY ARE THEN WELDED TOGETHER USING FOOT PEDAL OPERATED MACHINES 
THIS PRODUCT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR US 
WE ORDER ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PIECES AT A TIME 
THIS METHOD OF PRODUCTION SUITS IT VERY WELL 
WHAT MAKES THE PRODUCTS UNUSUAL ARE THE FORMS WE CREATE WITH THE WIRE 
THEN THE WINE RACK GOES OFF TO THE FACTORY TO BE ELECTROPLATED 
WHERE IT IS DIPPED INTO A SERIES OF VATS 
FIRST THE RACKS ARE PUT INTO A CLEANING BATH 
TO REMOVE ANY EXCESS OIL FROM THE METAL 
THEY ARE THEN PUT INTO A PICKLING BATH 
TO REMOVE ANY WELDING MARKS OR RUST 
THEN THEY ARE NICKEL PLATED WHICH TURNS THEM A BRIGHT YELLOW COLOUR 
AFTER THE NICKEL PLATING THEY ARE THEN CHROME PLATED 
BECAUSE CHROME WILL ONLY STICK TO NICKEL 
THEN THEY ARE CLEANED ONCE AGAIN 
TO NEUTRALISE AND REMOVE ANY EXCESS CHEMICALS 
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THE PRODUCTS 
HAVE A CONTEMPORARY FEEL 
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT 
THAT THEY HAVE A CERTAIN SCULPTURAL QUALITY WHEN EMPTY 
DURING THAT CLIP YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTICED 
THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS ANNA ALBRIGHT CONSIDERED 
SHE DECIDED TO GIVE THE PRODUCT A FRESH LOOK 
BUT STILL WANTED IT TO BE GOOD VALUE AND ATTACHED TO THE WALL 
SHE HAD TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE WAY THEY'D BE MADE 
IN THIS CASE AS A QUANTITY REPETITIVE BATCH 
PRODUCED TWO THOUSAND AT A TIME 
SHE ALSO THOUGHT THAT EIGHT WAS THE RIGHT NUMBER 
AND THEY SHOULD LIE FLAT TO KEEP THE CORK WET 
THE PROCESS ANNA WENT THROUGH TO DEVELOP THE WINE RACK 
STARTED WITH A COMPARISON OF EXISTING SIMILAR PRODUCTS 
TO RESEARCH THE MARKETPLACE 
SHE THEN MOVED ON TO FREEHAND SKETCHES TO GENERATE IDEAS 
AND DEVELOPED THESE BY MODELLING USING WIRE 
THE WINE RACK'S CONSTRUCTION WAS A FAIRLY LOW TECH PROCESS 
IT USED STANDARD SECTION WIRE GAUGE 
THEN WAS BENT BY HAND OPERATED BENDERS 
THEN IT WAS WORKED ON BY JIGS AND FORMERS 
BEFORE BEING CUT 
IT WAS SPOT WELDED TO JOIN THE METAL PERMANENTLY 
AND ALL THE SHARP EDGES WERE SMOOTHED USING A LINISHER 
THE ELECTROPLATING FINISHING PROCESS INVOLVED SEVERAL STAGES 
AS IT WAS CRUCIAL TO PROTECT THE WINE RACK 
AND ENHANCE ITS APPEARANCE 
IT WAS CLEANED TO DE GREASE THE METAL AND REMOVE OIL 
THEN IT WENT INTO A PICKLE BATH TO REMOVE ANY RUST OR WELD MARKS 
IT NEXT HAD TO BE PLATED TWICE FIRST WITH NICKEL 
THEN CHROME 
FINALLY IT WAS CLEANED 
TO NEUTRALISE THE CHEMICALS USED IN PLATING 
THERE'S A RANGE OF METAL FINISHES THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 
THESE INCLUDE OIL BLACKING 
PAINTING POLISHING 
PLASTIC COATING AND LACQUERING 
YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ON THE WEBSITE 
AS WELL AS BEING SUITABLE 
FOR CUTTING BEATING BENDING AND DRILLING 
METAL HAS ANOTHER WORKING PROPERTY 
IT CAN BE HEATED UNTIL IT MELTS 
AND WHILE IT'S A LIQUID POURED INTO A MOULD 
IT THEN COOLS AND SOLIDIFIES INTO A NEW SHAPE 
THIS WAY OF FORMING METAL IS CALLED CASTING 
THE METAL ALLOY A MIXTURE OF METALS 
IS BEING CAST INTO A CYLINDER HEAD FOR A CAR 
IN SAND CASTING THE MOULD IS MADE FROM AN OIL BOUND SAND 
WHICH IS COMPRESSED INTO A CASTING BOX 
MADE INTO TWO HALVES CALLED THE COPE AND DRAG 
THE MOULD CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE 
IN DIE CASTING THE MOULD IS MADE FROM HIGH CARBON STEEL 
AND CAN BE USED AGAIN AND AGAIN 
HERE ARE SOME OTHER MATERIALS THAN CAN BE USED IN CASTING 
AND A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE PRODUCTS THAT MIGHT BE MADE BY CASTING 
CAST STEEL IS USED FOR RAILWAY LINES 
CAST IRON IS OFTEN USED FROM FENCES RAILINGS AND MANHOLE COVERS 
WHILE ALUMINIUM IS CAST INTO ENGINE COMPONENTS 
FINALLY METAL ALLOYS ARE CAST INTO A VARIETY OF ORNAMENTS 
THE NEXT CLIP IS ABOUT MAKING A CLOCK 
WHILE YOU WATCH MAKE NOTES ABOUT WHICH PROCESSES ARE BEING USED 
MARIANNE FORREST SPECIALISES IN DESIGNING 
QUIRKY ONE OFF CLOCKS 
SHE HAS A PASSION TO PRODUCE EVERYDAY OBJECTS 
THAT ARE USEFUL BUT ALSO BEAUTIFUL 
THE CLOCKS ARE ALL MADE FROM BRONZE AN ALLOY OF COPPER AND TIN 
IT'S DUCTILE AND MALLEABLE 
BUT ALSO FAIRLY RESISTANT TO CORROSION 
THE TIN IN THE ALLOY MAKES IT HARDER AND STRONGER THAN COPPER ALONE 
HER INSPIRATION IS THE SHAPE OF A HALF MOON AND RISING SUN 
REPRESENTING THE PASSING OF TIME 
SPINNING PUSHES THE METAL AROUND A FORMER INTO A CONVEX SHAPE 
AFTER THAT THE METAL IS CUT INTO SHAPE ON A BANDSAW 
WITH A METAL CUTTING BLADE 
TO SOFTEN IT THE METAL IS HEATED THIS IS CALLED ANNEALING 
AND IT MAKES IT EASIER TO BEAT THE METAL INTO SHAPE 
FLUX COATS THE SEAM BETWEEN THE TWO PIECES OF METAL 
THEN MARIANNE USES HARD SOLDERING TO JOIN THEM TOGETHER 
HARD SOLDER MELTS AT SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DEGREES C. 
AS IT MELTS IT FLOWS ALONG THE SEAM BY CAPILLARY ACTION 
THE FINAL TEXTURE IS CREATED BY USING A GRINDER 
THE MAIN PROCESSES WERE 
SPINNING TO MAKE A SMOOTH CONVEX SHAPE 
ANNEALING 
THEN BEATING INTO SHAPE 
TWO PIECES WERE CAREFULLY SOLDERED TOGETHER 
AND FINALLY THE FINISH WAS ACHIEVED BY GRINDING 
HERE'S A QUESTION SIMILAR TO ONE YOU MIGHT GET IN YOUR EXAM 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME NOW AND HAVE A GO 
THEN PLAY ON TO CHECK YOUR WORK 
HERE'S THE ANSWER 
TO MAKE THE CLOCK HARD SOLDERING WAS USED 
TO CREATE PERMANENT JOINTS BETWEEN THE TWO HALVES 
HARD SOLDER MELTS AT SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DEGREES C. 
THE SOLDER FLOWS ONTO THE HEATED METAL ALONG THE JOINT 
DISTRIBUTES ITSELF BY CAPILLARY ACTION 
AND GRIPS THE TWO PIECES TOGETHER AS IT COOLS 
SOFT SOLDERING WORKS IN A SIMILAR WAY TO HARD SOLDER 
BUT IT MELTS AT TWO HUNDRED DEGREES C. AND IT PRODUCES A WEAKER JOINT 
THE LAST TYPE OF RESISTANT MATERIALS WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT IS PLASTICS 
PLASTIC IS VERY VERSATILE AND CAN BE USED TO MAKE 
A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS 
PLASTICS CAN BE OPAQUE TRANSLUCENT OR TRANSPARENT 
AND CAN BE EASILY COLOURED 
PLASTICS COME IN TWO MAIN TYPES 
THERMOPLASTICS AND THERMO SETTING PLASTICS OR THERMOSETS 
EXAMPLES OF THERMOPLASTICS INCLUDE POLYTHENE HIGH DENSITY HDPE 
AND IS USED TO MAKE BUCKETS 
WHILE POLYTHENE LOW DENSITY IS USED IN PACKAGING AND CARRIER BAGS 
POLYPROPYLENE IS TURNED INTO SEATS 
AND FOOD CONTAINERS 
ACRYLIC IS USED TO MAKE VARIOUS PRODUCTS INCLUDING SHOP SIGNS 
THERMOSETS INCLUDE EPOXY RESIN WHICH CAN BE TURNED 
INTO PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS 
AND POLYESTER RESIN CAN BE GLASS REINFORCED 
AND MAKES CANOES AND CAR REPAIRS 
ALSO PHENOL FORMALDEHYDE WHICH IS COMMONLY IN USE 
AS HANDLES ON SAUCEPANS AND KETTLES 
THE KEY PROPERTIES OF THERMOPLASTICS ARE 
ONCE I USED PLASTIC FOR THE FIRST TIME 
I ACTUALLY FOUND IT SO VERSATILE AND JUST REALLY EXCITING 
IT GAVE ME LOTS OF COLOURS AND TEXTURES AND SURFACES 
AND BECAUSE IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW MATERIAL 
IT'S STILL GOT POSSIBILITIES FOR EXPERIMENTING 
I ALSO MAKE OTHER JEWELLERY PIECES LIKE THESE USING A POLYESTER RESIN 
WHICH IS POURED INTO A SILICONE RUBBER MOULD 
ONCE THE RESIN IS SET AND I TAKE IT OUT OF THE MOULD I CUT THE EXCESS OFF AND I FILE IT AND SAND IT 
SO I GET A NICE SMOOTH SHAPE 
THEN I USE A THICKER POLYESTER RESIN AND TEXTURE THE SURFACE LIKE THIS 
THEN I CAN MAKE EARRINGS 
BECAUSE THIS IS A THERMOSET PLASTIC I CAN'T RESHAPE IT 
BUT I CAN BECAUSE IT'S SO VERSATILE USE IT IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS 
IT'S WONDERFUL FOR JEWELLERY IT'S EXCELLENT 
THAT WAS A THERMOSETTING PLASTIC IT CAN ONLY BE MOULDED ONCE 
ALL THESE OBJECTS ARE THERMOPLASTICS 
WHICH CAN BE MOULDED FORMED AND REFORMED IN MANY WAYS 
THEY'VE ALL BEEN PRODUCED USING INJECTION MOULDING 
INJECTION MOULDING WORKS LIKE THIS 
PLASTIC GRANULES WHICH ARE TRANSPARENT IN COLOUR 
ARE MIXED WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF COLOUR PIGMENT 
THIS COMBINATION GOES THROUGH A FUNNEL INTO A HEATING ELEMENT 
MATERIAL IS HEATED UP OVER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TO TWO HUNDRED DEGREES 
IT GETS FORCED INTO A CLOSED MOULD 
AT A VERY HIGH PRESSURE 
THE MOULD IS WATER COOLED 
THE MOULD OPENS AND OUT POPS A NEW ITEM 
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO MOULD PLASTIC 
THESE PLASTIC BOTTLES ARE BEING MANUFACTURED BY BLOW MOULDING 
WHERE A TUBE OF HOT THERMOPLASTIC IS PLACED INSIDE A MOULD AND BLOWN UP 
AN ACRYLIC SHEET CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO A PIECE OF RIGID PACKAGING 
BY THE PROCESS OF VACUUM FORMING 
COMING UP IS A CLIP WHICH SHOWS HOW A PLASTIC CHAIR 
WAS DEVELOPED AND PRODUCED 
AS YOU WATCH MAKES NOTES ON THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRODUCT 
AND THE PROCESS USED TO DEVELOP THE PRODUCT 
MOST OF THE WORK I'VE DONE UP TILL NOW HAS BEEN DOMESTIC FURNITURE 
PRODUCED IN SMALL BATCHES OF FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED A YEAR 
THESE CHAIRS AND SOFAS HAVE WOODEN FRAMES 
THEY ARE FOAM UPHOLSTERED AND FINISHED IN FABRIC OR LEATHER 
I APPROACHED AUTHENTICS WITH THE IDEA OF DESIGNING A MASS PRODUCED INJECTION MOULDED PLASTIC CHAIR 
I STARTED MY RESEARCH 
BY LOOKING AT THE CLASSIC PLASTIC CHAIRS OF THE LAST FIFTY YEARS TO SEE WHAT DESIGNERS HAD COME UP WITH 
I WANTED TO DESIGN AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE STANDARD TWELVE POINT NINE NINE PLASTIC CHAIR 
IT WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE MORE ELEGANT AND STILL REASONABLY PRICED 
I DECIDED FROM THE START THAT THIS CHAIR WOULD NOT HAVE ARM RESTS 
I WANTED PEOPLE TO FEEL THEY COULD USE THE CHAIR INSIDE THE HOUSE 
SAY IN A KITCHEN OR DINING ROOM 
PART OF MY RESEARCH TOOK ME TO THE LOCAL GARDEN CENTRE 
SO THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF THIS TYPE OF CHAIR 
I ALREADY KNEW THE ARM RESTS WERE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE STRUCTURE 
AND THAT BY REMOVING THEM I WOULD HAVE TO SOLVE A MAJOR DESIGN PROBLEM 
TWELVE POINT NINE NINE 
THANK YOU 
TAKING IT BACK TO THE STUDIO 
I SET ABOUT CUTTING THE ARM RESTS OFF TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM 
DOING THIS DRASTICALLY WEAKENED THE BACK OF THE CHAIR 
I BEGAN TO WORK ON THE STRUCTURE TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS OF STRENGTHENING THE BACK 
THE CHALLENGE WAS TO ACHIEVE THIS 
AND AT THE SAME TIME KEEP THE CHAIR LOOKING GOOD 
DESIGNING A CHAIR ALSO INVOLVES THINKING ABOUT THE ERGONOMICS 
OR COMFORT FACTOR 
I DID AS MUCH WORK AS I COULD 
AT THE DRAWING BOARD BEFORE GOING ON TO THE THREE D. COMPUTER MODELLING 
INPUTTING THE DIMENSIONS FROM MY TECHNICAL DRAWINGS ONTO THE COMPUTER 
WORKING IN THREE D. 
THAT WILL TIE UP WITH THE ANGLE ON THE LEG IF YOU PUT THEM IN 
YOU CAN SEE THERE 
EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS WE SENT OUR THREE D. DATA BY EMAIL 
TO THE MOULD MAKERS IN ITALY 
SO THEY COULD CARRY OUT DETAILED STRUCTURAL TESTS ON THE DESIGN BEFORE MAKING THE MOULD FOR THE CHAIR 
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE CHAIR IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH IN THE BACK AREA 
AROUND THAT 
WHERE IT GETS THINNER 
AND WE'VE GOT TO ADD UM TWO OR THREE RIBS 
BUT WE'LL HAVE TWO FOR NOW LIKE THIS 
THE CHAIR UNDERWENT MANY CHANGES BEFORE I WAS FINALLY HAPPY WITH IT 
THE COMPUTER DATA IS USED BY THE MOULD MAKER TO CUT THE METAL TO MAKE THE MOULD FOR THE CHAIR 
BEFORE THE DATA WAS SENT OFF 
I MADE A LIFE SIZE MODEL TO MAKE SURE THE CHAIR WORKED VISUALLY 
AND WAS REALLY COMFORTABLE 
AT LAST THE FIRST REAL CHAIR FROM ITALY 
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE DESIGNER TO BE INVOLVED 
RIGHT UP TO THE TIME WHEN THE CHAIR GOES INTO PRODUCTION 
AT THIS STAGE IT'S QUITE NORMAL TO MAKE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS 
THE BACK ISN'T QUITE STIFF ENOUGH 
WE NEED TO JOIN THESE TWO RIBS BY EXTENDING THIS ONE THIS ONE 
THIS ONE AND THAT ONE 
ADDING THESE EXTRA RIBS IS THE MOST EFFICIENT AND ECONOMICAL WAY OF STRENGTHENING THE BACK OF THE CHAIR 
I THINK THE CHAIR HAS FULFILLED THE ORIGINAL BRIEF VERY SUCCESSFULLY 
IT'S COMFORTABLE LIGHTWEIGHT AND GOOD LOOKING 
HERE'S A SAMPLE QUESTION OF THE KIND YOU COULD MEET IN THE EXAM 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME NOW AND HAVE A GO 
HOW DID YOU DO 
IT NEEDS TO FIT AUTHENTICS CONTEMPORARY STYLE 
FIRST MATTHEW DID SOME RESEARCH 
AS THE CHAIR'S STRUCTURE WAS KEY HE EXPERIMENTED WITH EXISTING CHAIRS SAWING THEIR ARMS OFF 
HE DEVELOPED THE CHAIR BY ADDING RIBS AND REINFORCEMENTS 
HE CREATED A FINAL DRAWING THAT WAS EMAILED TO MOULD MAKERS IN ITALY 
THESE MOULDS WERE MADE USING COMPUTER AIDED MANUFACTURE CAM 
WITH THE PROTOTYPE MADE 
HE COULD MAKE THE FINAL ADJUSTMENTS TO GET THE DESIGN RIGHT 
REINFORCING TO GIVE IT STRENGTH 
PLASTICS ARE VERY STABLE MATERIALS THEY TAKE A LONG TIME TO DECAY 
AN IMPORTANT THING TO THINK ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM AFTER WE'VE FINISHED WITH THEM 
HOW DO WE DISPOSE OF THE STUFF 
BURYING MEANS IT WILL STAY IN THE GROUND ALMOST INDEFINITELY PLUS WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF SPACE 
AND BURNING IT CAN RELEASE TOXINS 
WE CAN REFILL PLASTIC CONTAINERS INSTEAD OF JUST THROWING THEM AWAY 
FINALLY WE CAN RECYCLE IT AS IN THIS PLASTICS FACTORY IN ROTHERHAM 
BY BREAKING IT DOWN TO MAKE NEW PLASTIC PRODUCTS 
AS WELL AS UNDERSTANDING THE PROPERTIES AND PROCESSES 
YOU ALSO NEED TO KNOW HOW RESISTANT MATERIALS CAN BE USED IN MECHANISMS 
MECHANISMS ARE DEVICES WHICH TRANSMIT FORCE AND MOTION 
OFTEN CHANGING ITS SIZE AND DIRECTION 
BASIC MECHANISMS ARE LEVERS 
THINK OF A BOTTLE OPENER 
YOU CAN JOIN TWO OR MORE LEVERS TOGETHER TO MAKE A LINKAGE 
ROTARY SYSTEMS COULD BE THE GEARS IN A CLOCK OR THE PULLEY IN A LIFT 
IN THE NEXT CLIP YOU'LL SEE HOW SOME OF THESE MECHANISMS 
CAN BE COMBINED IN A SYSTEM TO OPERATE A KART 
WHILE YOU WATCH MAKE NOTES ON 
KARTING ISN'T A HI TECH SPORT 
IT'S ABOUT PUSHING SIMPLE MECHANISMS TO THEIR LIMITS 
IN EACH RACE CLASS KARTS MUST ALL USE THE SAME BASIC COMPONENTS 
SO KARTS ARE BUILT TO A STANDARD DESIGN 
STRIPPED TO ITS BARE BONES A KART'S SKELETON IS A RIGID STEEL CHASSIS 
IT SUPPORTS THE ENGINE AND ALL THE OTHER COMPONENTS 
THE BRAKING SYSTEM 
THE STEERING SYSTEM 
TOGETHER THEY LOOK COMPLICATED 
BUT ARE MADE OF SIMPLE MECHANISMS LIKE CRANKS PUSH RODS AND LEVERS 
IF THEY'RE SET UP RIGHT THE KART WILL DO OVER SEVENTY MILES PER HOUR 
GET IT WRONG AND YOU'RE OUT OF THE RACE 
DIFFERENT RACE TRACKS AND WEATHER CONDITIONS NEED DIFFERENT SET UPS ON THE KART 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT RIGHT IS TO KEEP ON TESTING MAKING CHANGES AND FINDING OUT WHAT WORKS BEST 
WE NEED THE KART TO GO FASTER ALONG THE STRAIGHTS 
SO WE'RE GOING TO LOWER THE GEAR RATIO BY TWO TEETH 
WHICH WILL MAKE IT DO FIVE MILES AN HOUR FASTER ALONG THE STRAIGHTS 
AT TOP SPEED THE KART'S WHEELS SPIN AROUND TWO THOUSAND TIMES PER MINUTE 
BUT TO GET MAXIMUM POWER THE ENGINE MUST TURN EIGHT TIMES FASTER 
AT SIXTEEN THOUSAND REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE 
THAT'S WHERE THE GEAR RATIO COMES IN 
THE ENGINE TURNS A SPROCKET WITH TEN TEETH THE SPROCKET DRIVING THE BACK WHEELS HAS EIGHTY TEETH 
LINKED BY THE CHAIN THE ENGINE TURNS EIGHT TIMES FOR EVERY REVOLUTION OF THE BACK WHEELS 
A RATIO OF EIGHT TO ONE THE RIGHT GEAR RATIO COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINNING AND LOSING 
IN THE WET FINE CONTROL OF STEERING IS VITAL 
KARTS COPE WITH CONDITIONS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE STEERING MECHANISM IS SO DIRECT 
A CRANK CONNECTED TO THE STEERING WHEEL PUSHES RODS LEFT AND RIGHT EACH ROD CONNECTS TO A LEVER 
THAT LEVER TURNS THE ROAD WHEEL 
SO HOW DID YOU GET ON 
AS YOU CAN SEE MECHANISMS CAN BE COMBINED INTO A SYSTEM 
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT SYSTEMS LATER 
IN AN EXAM YOU MIGHT BE ASKED ABOUT THE EFFICIENCY OF A MECHANISM 
A TOTALLY EFFICIENT SYSTEM IS ONLY POSSIBLE IN THEORY 
HERE'S OUR FIRST CHECKLIST OF WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ON RESISTANT MATERIALS AND MECHANISMS 
THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR RESISTANT MATERIALS CHECK OUT OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE INFORMATION AND EXERCISES 
THIS IS QUITE TRICKY STUFF 
BUT YOU NEED TO SHOW AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SYSTEMS ARE USED IN THE FOCUS AREA YOU STUDY 
A SYSTEM HAS AN INPUT TO START IT 
A PROCESS TO CREATE A CHANGE 
AND AN OUTPUT THE END RESULT OF THIS PROCESS 
IT'S BEST REPRESENTED BY A SERIES OF BOXES IN A BOXED DIAGRAM 
THE MOST BASIC TYPE OF SYSTEM IS AN OPEN LOOPED SYSTEM 
IN THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM 
THE INPUT TRIGGERS THE PROCESS 
AND THE PROCESS CONTROLS THE OUTPUT 
A MORE COMPLEX TYPE OF SYSTEM IS A CLOSED LOOPED SYSTEM 
LIKE AN OPEN LOOPED SYSTEM 
IT HAS AN INPUT A PROCESS AND AN OUTPUT 
BUT IT ALSO HAS AN ELEMENT CALLED FEEDBACK 
FEEDBACK IS THE INFORMATION FROM THE OUTPUT OF A SYSTEM 
WHICH IS FED BACK INTO THE INPUT TO CONTROL THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS 
TO UNDERSTAND COMPLEX SYSTEMS WE NEED TO BREAK THEM DOWN 
INTO A NUMBER OF SMALLER UNITS 
THESE ARE CALLED SUB SYSTEMS 
EACH SUB SYSTEM CARRIES OUT A PARTICULAR FUNCTION 
ONE EXAMPLE IS A GAS CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEM 
AS A BLOCK DIAGRAM IT LOOKS LIKE THIS 
BUT IN REALITY 
THE SYSTEM IS MADE UP OF THREE SUB SYSTEMS 
THE INPUT INCLUDES THE TIMER WITH A TEMPERATURE CONTROL AND PROCESSOR 
SECONDLY THERE'S THE BOILER SYSTEM 
WHEN THE BOILER GETS THE MESSAGE 
THE GAS SUPPLY IS TURNED ON AND IGNITED THIS HEATS UP THE WATER 
LASTLY THE OUTPUT THE PUMP MOVES THE WATER THROUGH THE SYSTEM ALONG THE PIPEWORK TO THE RADIATORS 
THE COOLING WATER IS PUMPED BACK FOR THE BOILER TO REHEAT 
IN ORDER TO REPRESENT THIS COMPLEX SYSTEM CLEARLY 
YOU CAN TRANSFORM IT INTO A SPIDER DIAGRAM 
THIS SEPARATES OUT EACH SUB SYSTEM 
THERE ARE THREE BASIC TYPES OF SYSTEM 
THE ONE YOU CHOOSE DEPENDS ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TASK 
IT SHOWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY BOARDMAN'S BICYCLE 
AND HOW THIS WAS TURNED INTO A ROAD GOING BIKE 
MIKE BURROWS IS AN ENGINEER BUT HE'S ALSO INTO BIKES AND TRIKES 
HE'S TRIED ALL KINDS OF IDEAS TO GO FASTER 
I'VE BEEN DESIGNING DIFFERENT SORTS OF BICYCLES OVER THE YEARS 
AND WHAT I DISCOVERED WAS THAT STREAMLINED ONES WENT THE FASTEST 
THE AIR IS A PROBLEM THE SMOOTHER THE SHAPE THE FASTER YOU GO 
WHAT I SUDDENLY REALISED WAS THAT YOU NEEDED A TUBE SHAPED LIKE AN AEROPLANE WING THAT WAS A BIKE 
RICHARD HILL SAW THE GENIUS OF MIKE'S IDEA HE'S AN EXPERT IN AERODYNAMICS 
WHICH IS THE SCIENCE OF AIR FLOW 
WITH A NEW SET OF HANDLEBARS THEY KEPT THE SAME OVERALL SHAPE FOR ANOTHER VERSION OF MIKE'S BIKE 
BUT THEY NEEDED SCIENTIFIC TESTS 
SO THEY WENT TO A SPECIAL LABORATORY CALLED A WIND TUNNEL 
HERE THERE'S NO NEED TO RIDE THE BIKE THROUGH THE AIR 
GIANT FANS BLOW AIR PAST THE BIKE IN PRECISELY CONTROLLED CONDITIONS 
WE VISUALISE THE AIR BY USING A SMOKE WAND WHICH FORMS A TRAIL OF SMOKE 
TO SEE WHERE THE AIR FLOW REMAINS ATTACHED TO THE BODY OF THE BIKE AND WHERE IT SEPARATES AWAY 
AND THE BIKE WAS VERY STREAMLINED 
IT HARDLY DISTURBED THE AIR FLOW AT ALL 
SO Q. E. D. CHALLENGED MIKE TO COME UP WITH A ROAD GOING VERSION 
I'VE ALWAYS BUILT THE BICYCLE FOR MYSELF TO USE 
WHICH DOES MEAN A ROAD BICYCLE BUT WITH A SINGLE GEAR WITH A BRAKE ON THE FRONT 
IN THE BEST TRADITIONS OF THE ONE OFF BICYCLE MAKER 
MIKE HAS LABOURED FOR THREE MONTHS TO MAKE THIS ROAD GOING VERSION 
NOW HE'S HANDED IT OVER FOR ITS FINAL PAINTING NO ONE DISPUTES THE HUGE POTENTIAL OF HIS DESIGN 
BACK AT THE LAUNCH PAD OF OPPORTUNITY MIKE PUTS THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO THE Q. E. D. BIKE 
IT'S HIS LATEST CONTRIBUTION TO BICYCLING HISTORY ROAD GOING WITH GEARS AND BRAKES 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOTTED QUITE A FEW SUB SYSTEMS 
FIRST THE CARBON FIBRE MONOCOQUE SHELL SUPPORTS THE RIDER WHEELS AND THE TRANSMISSION 
THE GEAR RATIO IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR SPROCKETS 
THIS CHANGES THE FORCE NEEDED FOR A SINGLE REVOLUTION OF THE BACK WHEEL 
THE BRAKES USE LEVERS TO FOCUS THE FORCE APPLIED BY THE USER TO STOP THE BIKE 
AND THEN THE SPEEDOMETER IS AN ELECTRONICALLY OPERATED COUNTER 
FINALLY THE TRANSMISSION THIS IS THE SPROCKET AND CHAIN 
WHICH TRANSFERS THE ROTARY MOTION OF THE CRANK AND PEDALS TO THE REAR WHEEL 
WELL DONE IF YOU SPOTTED ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THIS MECHANICAL SYSTEM 
IT GOES THROUGH ALL THE PARTS OF A SEMI AUTOMATICS PROCESS 
THE SIMPLE CARDBOARD BOX 
WE RELY ON IT FOR TRANSPORTING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING USING THOUSANDS EVERY DAY 
BUT THEY ALL START LIFE AS A FLAT SHEET OF CORRUGATED CARD 
THIS FACTORY TURNS THOUSANDS OF THESE SHEETS INTO USEFUL BOXES 
BUT THE PROCESS STARTS BACK IN THE OFFICE 
WHEN AN ORDER COMES IN FROM A CUSTOMER 
ALL THE DETAILS ARE IMMEDIATELY PLACED INTO THIS COMPUTER WHERE IT'S SCHEDULED 
ENSURING MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY 
AND AT ANY TIME THE PROGRESS OF THAT ORDER 
CAN BE CHECKED WHEREVER IT IS IN THE FACTORY 
COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN USED IN MANUFACTURING 
MONDY PACKAGING USES A SYSTEM KNOWN AS JUST IN TIME 
IT'S EXTREMELY POPULAR 
IT'S ORDER LED AND RELIES ON EFFICIENT CONTROL SYSTEMS 
TO ENSURE THAT THE INPUTS PROCESSES AND OUTPUT 
ARE PERFECTLY SYNCHRONISED TO AVOID DELAYS 
ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OF ACCURACY 
AND AUTOMATE QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS 
THEY ALSO MAKE IT EASIER 
FOR COMPANIES TO MONITOR SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE 
BY AUTOMATING TEDIOUS REPETITIVE TASKS 
THE COMPUTERISED SYSTEM MAKES THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS FASTER 
AND IT CAN BE OPERATED CONTINUOUSLY NOW WATCH THE REST OF THE CLIP 
AND MAKE NOTES ON THE SEMI AUTOMATIC PROCESS INVOLVED 
FROM THIS COMPUTER THE INFORMATION ARRIVES ON THE FACTORY FLOOR 
AND IS TAKEN TO THE CHOSEN MACHINE 
HERE IT'S A PRINTER SLOTTER AND ROTARY DIE CUTTER 
THIS PRINTS ONTO CARD AND THEN CUTS THE CARD READY TO BECOME BOXES 
IN ORDER TO SET UP THIS VAST MACHINE IT'S BROKEN INTO SECTIONS 
THE FIRST SECTION IS THE FEEDER SECTION 
NEXT THERE ARE TWO PRINTING SECTIONS 
FINALLY COMES CUTTING AND CREASING 
THE THICKNESS AND WIDTH OF THE CARDBOARD IS CHECKED 
AND THE MEASUREMENTS FED INTO THE COMPUTER 
THIS MACHINE USES PHOTOPOLYMER PLATES 
THESE PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY FLEXOGRAPHIC PRINTS 
THEY'RE PLACED IN THE PRINTING SECTION 
ACCURACY IS KEY 
ANY MISTAKE AND THE BOX WILL BE REJECTED 
THIS IS A ROTARY DIE SECTION 
MADE IN TWO HALVES IT FITS ONTO A ROLLER 
EVERY SHAPE AND SIZE OF BOX HAS ITS OWN TEMPLATE 
WITH CAREFULLY DESIGNED KNIVES AND CREASES 
ONCE THAT'S PUT INTO PLACE 
THE MACHINE COMES TOGETHER AND IS READY TO GO 
THE PROCESS BEGINS BY FEEDING CORRUGATED CARDBOARD 
INTO THE MACHINE INPUTTING 
THE CARDBOARD IS MANUALLY PLACED INTO THE FEEDER SECTION 
WHERE ROLLERS CARRY IT THROUGH 
IF IT'S THE WRONG SIZE IT'S REJECTED AND RECYCLED 
STEP TWO IS THE PRINTING 
THIS MACHINE PRINTS ONTO THE BOTTOM OF THE CARD 
THIS ENSURES HIGH QUALITY RESULTS 
AS NO DEBRIS FROM THE CARDBOARD CAN INTERFERE WITH THE PRINTING 
ONCE THE CARD HAS BEEN PRINTED IT MOVES TO THE DIE CUTTER SECTION 
HERE THE DIE CUT TEMPLATE ON THE TOP ROLLER 
CUTS OUT THE BOX AS REQUIRED 
ANY WASTE AND DUST IS REMOVED AND RECYCLED 
AT THIS STAGE THE CARD IS ALSO CREASED 
FINALLY THE NEWLY CUT CARDBOARD PRINTED UNDERNEATH 
ROLLS OFF ONTO A PALLET 
EACH SHEET IS COUNTED 
AND ONCE THE JOB IS COMPLETE THE PALLET MOVES OFF DOWN THE FACTORY 
EITHER TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE CUSTOMER 
OR TO BE STITCHED AND GLUED 
HERE'S THE FULL PROCESS 
FIRST CARDBOARD IS PLACED INTO THE FEEDER 
THE CARD MOVES FROM THE PRINTING SECTION TO THE CUTTING AND CREASING AREA 
ANY WASTE IS REMOVED FOR RECYCLING 
AND THE PREPARED CARDBOARD MOVES ON DOWN THE FACTORY 
NOW WE CAN TRANSFORM THIS PROCESS INTO A FLOW DIAGRAM 
THE START IS REPRESENTED BY A BOX A RECTANGLE WITH ROUNDED CORNERS 
A LINE LINKS THIS TO THE FIRST PROCESS 
THE MACHINE BEING SWITCHED ON 
THEN COMES A DECISION BOX DIAMOND SHAPED 
AT THIS POINT THE CARD IS CHECKED BY HAND 
AS IT'S FED INTO THE MACHINE 
ANY REJECTED CARD IS RECYCLED 
THE CARD IS NOW INPUTTED INSIDE THE MACHINE 
IT GOES THROUGH TO THE PRINTING PROCESS 
WHERE IT CAN BE PRINTED IN UP TO TWO COLOURS 
IT'S THEN CUT OUT AND CREASED USING A DIE CUT TEMPLATE 
AND ANY WASTE IS RECYCLED HERE INDICATED BY ANOTHER DECISION BOX 
THE PREPARED CARD THEN LEAVES THE MACHINE 
ONCE ALL THE CARD HAS BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS STOPS 
FOR AN AUTOMATIC SYSTEM A REMOTE SENSOR OR ONE THAT HAS A FIXED CYCLE TRIGGERS THE OPERATION 
A CYCLE IS ONE COMPLETE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM 
IT'S OFTEN REPETITIVE 
A CAR BARRIER IS AN AUTOMATIC SYSTEM 
IT'S TRIGGERED BY A CAR ON PNEUMATIC SENSORS 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME AND DRAW A FLOW DIAGRAM FOR A CAR BARRIER 
THIS IS HOW YOUR FLOW DIAGRAM SHOULD LOOK 
FIRST A PNEUMATIC VALVE IS TRIGGERED BY THE APPROACHING VEHICLE 
THIS VALVE ACTS AS A PNEUMATIC SENSOR 
THIS SENSOR ONE CHECKS IF THERE IS AN INPUT 
IF YES THE OUTPUT ZERO LIFTS THE BARRIER 
IT WAITS ONE SECOND 
THEN STOPS LIFTING THE BARRIER 
A SECOND PNEUMATIC SENSOR 
DETECTS THE VEHICLE MOVING AWAY FROM THE BARRIER 
THIS SENSOR TWO CHECKS IF THERE'S AN INPUT 
IF YES THE OUTPUT TWO LOWERS THE BARRIER 
AND WAITS ONE SECOND 
THEN STOPS CLOSING THE BARRIER 
THAT BARRIER RELIED ON AN ELECTRONIC PRESSURE SENSOR 
TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF THE CAR 
THIS ACTS AS AN INPUT TO OPERATE A PNEUMATIC CYLINDER 
WHICH LIFTS AND THEN LOWERS THE BARRIER 
HERE IS A COMMON PNEUMATIC CIRCUIT 
IT CONNECTS A VALVE 
WITH A PNEUMATIC CYLINDER 
IN THIS CASE 
IT'S A PUSH BUTTON THREE PORT VALVE 
AND A SINGLE ACTING CYLINDER 
THE UNIDIRECTIONAL FLOW CONTROL VALVE IN THE MIDDLE 
IS A FLOW REGULATOR 
AS IT IMPEDES AIRFLOW IT SLOWS THE SPEED OF THE AIR 
WHEN THE VALVE IS DEPRESSED 
AIR FLOWS FROM THE AIR SUPPLY INTO PORT ONE 
THEN LEAVES AIR OUT PORT TWO 
THEN TRAVELS THROUGH THE UNIDIRECTIONAL FLOW CONTROL VALVE 
THEN IT FILLS THE SINGLE ACTING CYLINDER 
WHEN THE PUSH BUTTON ON THE THREE PORT VALVE IS RELEASED 
THE SPRING IN THE CYLINDER 
FORCES THE PLUNGER BACK INSIDE THE CYLINDER 
THEN THE AIR RETURNS TO THE THREE PORT VALVE 
AND ESCAPES THROUGH ITS EXHAUST PORT THREE 
IT'S POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE THE FORCE PRODUCED BY A CYLINDER 
USING THIS EQUATION 
IN OTHER WORDS 
IF YOU VISIT THE WEBSITE YOU'LL FIND MORE 
ABOUT PNEUMATIC CONTROL SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS 
SYSTEMS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ALL DESIGN AREAS 
AND THEY OFTEN INVOLVE ELECTRONICS 
THIS NEXT SECTION IS GOING TO FOCUS ON ELECTRONICS 
AND ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS 
COMPONENTS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ALL ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS 
WE'LL LOOK AT THESE 
AS WELL AS SENSORS PROCESSORS AND OUTPUT DEVICES 
THEN WE'LL SEE HOW THESE WORK TOGETHER IN A RANGE OF CIRCUITS 
BEFORE YOU CAN DESIGN AN ELECTRONIC PRODUCT 
YOU NEED TO KNOW SOME FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 
OR P. D. 
IF WE COMPARE CURRENT TO WATER FLOWING THROUGH A PIPE 
THEN VOLTAGE IS THE PRESSURE 
MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOLTAGE AND CURRENT 
IT'S EASY TO GET THEM MIXED UP 
ALTHOUGH SOME OFFER MORE RESISTANCE THAN OTHERS 
THESE STOP VIRTUALLY ALL OR MOST CURRENT FLOW 
TRAVELLING THROUGH THEM 
COPPER HAS A PARTICULARLY LOW RESISTANCE 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VOLTAGE CURRENT AND RESISTANCE 
IS DEFINED BY OHM'S LAW 
SIMPLY PUT RESISTANCE R. EQUALS VOLTAGE V. OVER CURRENT I 
THE EASIEST WAY TO REMEMBER THIS FORMULA IS WITH THE MAGIC TRIANGLE 
JUST PUT YOUR THUMB OVER THE SYMBOL YOU WISH TO FIND 
AND THERE'S YOUR ANSWER 
SO VOLTAGE IS CURRENT X. RESISTANCE 
WHILE CURRENT IS VOLTAGE OVER RESISTANCE 
ONCE YOU'VE GOT A HANDLE ON THESE VITAL IMPORTANT CONCEPTS 
YOU CAN USE THE KNOWLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT 
THE BASIS OF ALL ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS 
THERE ARE MANY COMPONENTS THAT CAN BE USED TO BUILD AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT 
THESE CAN BE ELECTRICAL LIKE A SWITCH OR LAMP 
OR ELECTRONIC SUCH AS LOGIC GATES 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK IN DETAIL AT A RANGE OF COMPONENTS 
FIRST RESISTORS THESE ARE SIMPLE COMPONENTS 
WHICH IMPEDE THE FLOW OF CURRENT THROUGH A CIRCUIT 
REMEMBER THAT RESISTANCE IS MEASURED IN OHMS 
THE HIGHER THE RESISTANCE 
THE LESS CURRENT THAT CAN FLOW THROUGH IT FOR A FIXED VOLTAGE 
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF RESISTOR 
THIS IS A FIXED RESISTOR OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OHMS OR TWO HUNDRED K. 
AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS IT HAS A FIXED RESISTANCE 
THE OTHER KIND IS A VARIABLE RESISTOR 
ALSO KNOWN AS A POTENTIOMETER 
THESE HAVE A RESISTANCE YOU CAN CHANGE 
LIKE THE VOLUME CONTROL FOR YOUR HEADPHONES 
WHEN RESISTORS ARE PLACED IN SERIES 
THE TOTAL RESISTANCE IS MUCH GREATER BECAUSE OF THE ACCUMULATIVE EFFECT 
OF RESISTORS AS THE CURRENT PASSES THROUGH THE CHAIN 
TO CALCULATE THE TOTAL RESISTANCE 
YOU JUST ADD UP THE RESISTANCE OF EACH RESISTOR IN OHMS 
BUT IF YOU PLACE THE RESISTORS IN PARALLEL 
THE OVERALL RESISTANCE IS ACTUALLY REDUCED 
TO LESS THAN THAT OF A SINGLE RESISTOR 
BECAUSE EACH RESISTOR PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE FOR THE CURRENT 
TO WORK OUT THE TOTAL RESISTANCE FOR PARALLEL RESISTORS 
YOU USE THE FORMULA 
COMBINATIONS OF RESISTORS IN SERIES AND IN PARALLEL 
CAN BE USED TO GIVE PRECISE CONTROL 
OVER THE FLOW OF CURRENT THROUGH A CIRCUIT 
ANOTHER BASIC COMPONENT IS CALLED A CAPACITOR 
THESE CAN STORE AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE 
THIS IS A TYPICAL ONE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NUMEROUS VARIETIES 
IN A CIRCUIT IT'S INDICATED BY TWO BOLD LINES 
THE TIME IT TAKES FOR A CAPACITOR TO CHARGE AND DISCHARGE 
CAN BE ACCURATELY CONTROLLED 
USING RESISTORS IN SERIES WITH THE CAPACITOR 
THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE STORED PER VOLT THAT'S FROM A ONE VOLT SUPPLY 
IS CALLED CAPACITANCE AND IS MEASURED IN FARADS 
CAPACITORS ARE OFTEN USED IN TIMING AND COUNTING CIRCUITS 
A TRANSISTOR IS A COMMONLY USED COMPONENT 
IT CAN BE USED AS A SWITCH OR AS AN AMPLIFIER 
A TRANSISTOR IS NORMALLY SEALED INSIDE A LIGHT PROOF CASE 
THROUGH WHICH THREE METAL LEADS PROTRUDE 
THE THREE LEADS OF A TRANSISTOR 
ARE CALLED THE COLLECTOR BASE AND EMITTER 
IN THE MOST COMMONLY USED TYPE 
KNOWN AS THE NPN 
THE COLLECTOR IS CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY 
AND THE EMITTER IS CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL 
THE TRANSISTOR CAN BE MADE TO OPERATE 
AS A SWITCH OR AS AN AMPLIFIER 
BY CONTROLLING THE CURRENT INTO THE BASE LEAD OF THE TRANSISTOR 
IN OTHER WORDS A TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIES THE BASE CURRENT 
TO A LARGER COLLECTOR CURRENT 
THE FACTOR BY WHICH THE BASE CURRENT IS AMPLIFIED IS CALLED THE GAIN 
GO TO THE WEBSITE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT TRANSISTORS 
MANY IMPORTANT ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS 
ARE MADE FROM SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIAL 
DEPENDING ON CERTAIN CONDITIONS 
A SEMICONDUCTOR CAN ACT LIKE A CONDUCTOR OR AN INSULATOR 
A DIODE IS ANOTHER KEY CIRCUIT COMPONENT 
THAT'S ALSO MADE OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIAL 
THEY ONLY ALLOW CURRENT TO FLOW IN ONE DIRECTION 
THE LINE ON THE DIODE INDICATES THE NEGATIVE END THE CATHODE 
IT HELPS YOU WORK OUT HOW TO CONNECT IT WITHIN A CIRCUIT 
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DOING THIS 
SO IN THIS CIRCUIT THE BULB LIGHTS 
REVERSE BIASING IS THE OPPOSITE 
HERE THE BULB WON'T LIGHT 
THE BEST WAY TO GET TO GRIPS WITH ELECTRONIC DESIGN IS TO 
ELECTRONIC DESIGN REQUIRES 
THERE MAY ALSO BE FEEDBACK FROM THE OUTPUT TO THE CIRCUIT 
TO CONTROL THE PROCESS 
THIS SEQUENCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
DON'T GO ON UNTIL YOU'VE DIGESTED THIS DIAGRAM 
THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF INPUT DEVICES 
PROBABLY THE SIMPLEST OF THESE IS A SWITCH 
WHICH MAKES AND BREAKS CIRCUITS 
IN A REED SWITCH 
A GLASS TUBE HOUSES A PAIR OF CLOSELY SPACED SWITCH CONTACTS 
THE PROXIMITY OF A MAGNETIC FIELD 
CAUSES THE CONTACTS TO CLOSE AND SWITCH ON THE CIRCUIT 
SENSORS ARE ALSO INPUT DEVICES 
THESE SEND INFORMATION TO THE PROCESSOR ABOUT ITS ENVIRONMENT 
A THERMISTOR SENSES TEMPERATURE CHANGES 
AND IS USED IN A CENTRAL HEATING CIRCUIT 
YOU CAN ALSO USE LIGHT DEPENDENT RESISTORS LDRS 
WHICH ARE SENSITIVE TO LIGHT 
WHEN LIGHT FALLS ON AN LDR ITS RESISTANCE DECREASES 
POTENTIOMETERS ARE SENSITIVE TO ROTARY OR LINEAR MOVEMENT 
AND MICROPHONES PICK UP SOUND 
AND CONVERT IT INTO AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT 
OUTPUT DEVICES CONVERT ELECTRICAL SIGNALS FROM PROCESSING DEVICES 
INTO LIGHT AS IN LAMPS OR LIGHT EMITTING DIODES LEDS 
SOUND AS IN AN ALARM OR LOUD SPEAKER 
ROTARY MOVEMENT AS IN MOTORS 
OR LINEAR MOVEMENT AS IN SOLENOIDS OR LINEAR ACTUATORS 
OR INFORMATION 
A POPULAR OUTPUT DEVICE IS CALLED A RELAY 
THIS CAN BE SWITCHED ON BY A TRANSISTOR OR AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT 
IN TURN IT WILL SWITCH ON A HIGH VOLTAGE LOAD 
LIKE A MAINS OPERATED MOTOR 
THIS REDUCES ANY RISK OF A SEVERE ELECTRIC SHOCK 
IN ORDER TO WORK ALL ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS INVOLVE CIRCUITS 
THIS SIMPLE CIRCUIT COMBINES RESISTORS AND A TRANSISTOR 
IF THE VOLTAGE OR CURRENT IN A CIRCUIT IS TOO HIGH 
THE TRANSISTOR CAN BE DAMAGED 
THAT'S WHY RESISTORS ARE USED TO CONTROL THE CURRENT IN THIS CIRCUIT 
A SWITCH CONTROLS THE FLOW OF CURRENT THROUGH THIS CIRCUIT 
WHEN ON CURRENT FLOWS THROUGH THE RESISTOR 
TO THE BASE OF THE TRANSISTOR 
THIS ALLOWS CURRENT TO FLOW SO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP DIMLY 
WHEN THE SWITCH IS OFF NO CURRENT FLOWS SO THE BULB REMAINS OFF 
IN THIS CIRCUIT 
THE SINGLE TRANSISTOR DOESN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH GAIN 
TO LIGHT THE BULB BRIGHTLY 
A DARLINGTON PAIR CAN BE USED TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM 
THIS IS WHERE TWO TRANSISTORS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER 
SO THAT THE CURRENT IS AMPLIFIED BY THE FIRST 
THEN AMPLIFIED FURTHER BY THE SECOND 
THE OVERALL CURRENT GAIN 
IS EQUAL TO THE TWO INDIVIDUAL GAINS MULTIPLIED TOGETHER 
THIS GIVES THE DARLINGTON PAIR A VERY HIGH CURRENT GAIN 
POSSIBLY UP TO TEN THOUSAND 
SO THAT MEANS THAT ONLY A TINY BASE CURRENT 
IS REQUIRED TO MAKE THE PAIR SWITCH ON 
PROVIDING A LARGE ENOUGH COLLECTOR CURRENT 
TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB SHINE BRIGHTLY 
THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER OR OP AMP 
IS AN EIGHT PIN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT 
IT'S MUCH MORE SENSITIVE AND RELIABLE THAN A STANDARD TRANSISTOR 
THE SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY ONE OP AMP IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY USED 
IT'S A COMPLEX CIRCUIT ON A SILICON CHIP 
THE SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY ONE OP AMP CAN BE USED AS A COMPARATOR 
LIKE THE TEMPERATURE CONTROLLER OR THERMOSTAT IN CENTRAL HEATING 
GO TO THE WEBSITE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT OP AMPS AND HOW THEY'RE USED 
THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER IS A TYPE OF ANALOGUE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT 
ANALOGUE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS I. C.'S PROCESS ANALOGUE SIGNALS 
AN ANALOGUE SIGNAL CAN HAVE ANY VOLTAGE 
BETWEEN AN UPPER AND A LOWER VALUE 
A LOUD SPEAKER OF A STEREO SYSTEM IS A TYPICAL ANALOGUE SYSTEM 
WHEN THE VOLUME IS TURNED UP 
THE SOUND INCREASES SLOWLY AND CONSTANTLY 
A MORE MODERN TYPE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUIT I. C. 
IS KNOWN AS DIGITAL OR LOGIC THESE PROCESS DIGITAL SIGNALS 
A DIGITAL SIGNAL HAS TWO VOLTAGE LEVELS HIGH OR LOW 
AND MANY KINDS OF SIMPLER CHIPS 
MODERN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS AND MOBILE PHONES 
DEPEND ON DIGITAL SIGNALS 
THE MORSE CODE IS A DIGITAL SIGNAL 
THE SIGNAL IS SENT AS A SERIES OF ON AND OFF PULSES 
THE SIGNAL IS EITHER HIGH ON OR LOW OFF 
A DIGITAL SIGNAL CAN BE PRODUCED BY TRANSISTORS 
WHEN THEY ACT AS ELECTRONIC SWITCHES 
WHEN NO CURRENT FLOWS INTO THE BASE LEAD THE TRANSISTOR IS OFF 
AND WHEN A SMALL CURRENT FLOWS IN THE BASE 
THE TRANSISTOR IS SWITCHED ON 
AS SWITCHES THEY CAN ALSO BE USED TO INPUT DATA IN BINARY FORM 
THE DIGITS ZERO AND ONE CAN BE SUBSTITUTED 
BY THE OFF AND ON STATES OF A SWITCH 
THE ZERO AND ONE COMBINATIONS 
FORM THE TWO DIGIT OR BIT BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM 
THE BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM CAN REPRESENT DECIMAL NUMBERS 
LETTERS VOLTAGES AND MANY OTHER KINDS OF INFORMATION 
THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE TIMER IS AN EIGHT PIN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT 
WHICH IS MADE FROM TRANSISTORS 
IN COMBINATION WITH RESISTORS AND CAPACITORS 
IT CAN BE USED TO PRODUCE A DIGITAL SIGNAL 
IT CAN EITHER PRODUCE JUST ONE PULSE A MONOSTABLE TIMING CIRCUIT 
OR A SERIES OF PULSES AN ASTABLE TIMING CIRCUIT 
THIS CONTROL MEANS THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE TIMER CAN FORM PART OF DIGITAL CIRCUITS 
IT CAN BE A DIGITAL SWITCH ANOTHER NAME FOR THIS IS A LOGIC GATE 
THESE SWITCHES CAN WORK TOGETHER TO BECOME A LOGIC SYSTEM 
THESE COMBINE INPUTS TO PRODUCE THREE ALTERNATIVE OUTPUTS 
AND OR AND NOT 
TAKE A LOOK AT THE WEBSITE TO FIND OUT MORE 
IN THE CLIP COMING UP A SCIENTIST HAS USED DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 
TO PRODUCE A CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A BALLOON 
IT INVOLVES SENSORS A MICROPROCESSOR 
AND PROGRAMMABLE MEMORY CHIPS 
THESE ARE USUALLY CALLED PICS 
WHICH STANDS FOR PROGRAMMABLE INTERFACE CONTROLLERS 
THEY'RE AUTOMATED LOGIC GATES 
WHICH CAN BE PROGRAMMED TO BEHAVE IN PRE SET WAYS 
AND BE GIVEN CERTAIN INPUTS 
TAKE NOTES WHILE YOU WATCH THE FILM 
ON HOW THIS AUTOMATIC DIGITAL SYSTEM WORKED 
THIS MAN IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S LEADING ROBOT EXPERTS 
HE'S A PROFESSOR OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD 
AND FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS HE'S BEEN MAKING MACHINES 
THAT CAN LEARN AND INTERACT LIKE ANIMALS 
NOEL'S AMBITION IS TO GET HIS ROBOTS INTO THE SKY 
AND THIS IS IT THE FLYBORG 
THIS FLYING ROBOT HAS BEEN GIVEN THE ABILITY TO REACT TO ITS SURROUNDINGS 
AND LEARN FROM ITS EXPERIENCES 
O. K. TALK ME THROUGH THE FLYBORG 
WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS A MICROPROCESSOR 
AND IT'S CONNECTED TO LOTS OF LITTLE PIC PROCESSORS 
AND THAT'S THE CENTRAL CONTROL FOR THE ROBOT AND WHAT YOU'VE GOT IN HERE AS WELL IN AMONG THIS MESS 
IS OUR GYROSCOPES AND ACCELEROMETERS AND THEY'RE THERE 
TO KEEP THE ROBOT FLYING IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
AND MAINTAIN IT IN THAT DIRECTION DESPITE WIND BLOWING IT SIDEWAYS 
THESE WIRES HERE YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF WIRES 
FINE WIRES YOU CAN'T SEE FROM A DISTANCE 
CONNECTED UP TO THESE LITTLE GRILLES UP THERE 
AND THESE ARE THE SONAR SENSORS 
AND THEY WORK VERY MUCH LIKE BATS' SENSORS 
SO THEY SEND OUT A SOUND SIGNAL 
GET IT BACK AGAIN AND TIME HOW LONG THAT TOOK AND THAT TELLS IT HOW FAR IT IS AWAY FROM AN OBSTACLE 
WE HAVE SOFTWARE IN THERE THAT WILL HOLD VERY SIMPLE RULES 
THAT WILL TELL IT FOR INSTANCE NOT TO FLY TOO CLOSE TO A WALL OR TO ANOTHER FLYBORG 
BUT THE NEURAL NETWORK'S MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE 
SO WE'LL BE LEARNING TO DEAL WITH WIND CURRENTS 
AND GENERAL FLUX IN THE AIR 
UP UNTIL NOW THE FLYBORG HAS BEEN REMOTE CONTROLLED 
AFTER SOME MINOR READJUSTMENTS IT'S TIME FOR THE BIG TEST 
THE FLYBORG IS AIMED DIRECTLY AT A WALL 
AND THE REMOTE CONTROL SWITCHED OFF LEAVING IT TO FEND FOR ITSELF 
SUCCESS 
THE FLYBORG HAS DETECTED THE WALL 
THE INFORMATION FROM ITS SONAR SENSORS 
IS SENT TO THE ONBOARD COMPUTER 
WHICH HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED TO AVOID GETTING CLOSER THAN FOUR METRES TO ANY OBJECT 
THE COMPUTER TAKES INTO ACCOUNT 
INFORMATION FROM THE GYROSCOPES AND ACCELEROMETERS 
AND ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS TO THE MOTORS TO AVOID COLLISION 
AS YOU SAW IN THAT FILM THE WHOLE SYSTEM RELIED ON PROGRAMMABLE INTERFACE CONTROLLERS PICS 
THESE ENABLED THE BALLOON TO BE OPERATED BY REMOTE CONTROL OR AUTOMATICALLY 
THE REMOTE CONTROL USED SWITCHES ON A CONTROL BOX TO SEND RADIO WAVES TO THE FLYBORG 
NOW HAVE A GO AT WRITING DOWN HOW THE AUTOMATIC SYSTEM WORKED 
PAUSE THE PROGRAMME THEN YOU CAN CHECK YOUR WORK BACK 
THE BALLOON RELIED ON AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM WHICH USED A FORM OF SONAR 
TO JUDGE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE BALLOON AND ANY OBSTACLES 
IN RESPONSE TO CERTAIN SIGNALS FROM THE SENSORS AND GYROSCOPE 
THE PIC CHIP WAS AT THE CENTRE OF THIS SYSTEM 
IT STORED AND REMEMBERED A SERIES OF COMMANDS IN RESPONSE TO THE INPUTS 
THIS MEMORY OF THE COMMANDS ALLOWED THE BALLOON TO RESPOND QUICKLY 
TO THE FEEDBACK FROM SENSORS 
THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR SYSTEMS AND CONTROL AND ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS 
HERE'S OUR CHECKLIST OF WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 
NOW MOVING ON TO TEXTILE TECHNOLOGY 
FULL DETAILED EXPLANATIONS WILL GAIN MAXIMUM MARKS 
GENERAL RESPONSES WILL GET SOME MARKS AND ONE WORD ANSWERS OFTEN GET NONE 
IN RESISTANT MATERIALS PAPERS WOOD OR METAL IS TOO VAGUE 
WHEREAS PINE OR MILD STEEL IS A SPECIFIC RESPONSE 
SOME QUESTIONS CARRY MANY MARKS 
A BREAKDOWN OF MARKS IS GIVEN AT THE END OF EACH SECTION IN BRACKETS 
BE AWARE OF THIS 
THE MORE MARKS GIVEN TO A QUESTION THE MORE DETAIL IS REQUIRED 
SO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE FINAL FOCUS AREA IN THIS PROGRAMME 
TEXTILE TECHNOLOGY 
IN ANY FOCUS AREA IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RAW MATERIALS FIBRES AND FABRICS 
THIS DEPENDS ON THE FIBRE THEY'RE MADE FROM AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION 
IF YOU WERE MAKING A CHILD'S NIGHTDRESS YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE IT HIGHLY FLAMMABLE 
THE NEXT CLIP SHOWS A FABRIC DESIGNED TO BE FIT FOR PURPOSE 
WHILE YOU WATCH WORK OUT 
YOU'D THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO MAKE A COMPLETELY WATERPROOF OUTFIT 
WOULD BE TO USE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF LEAKPROOF SEAMS BUT NOT SO 
THE PEOPLE WHO WEAR THESE NEED AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE 
SO THE OUTCOME IS LIKE A JIGSAW 
OVER EIGHTY PIECES ARE STUCK TOGETHER WITH A SPECIAL HEAT SEALED SEAM 
HERE AT THE FACTORY ALL THESE GARMENTS ARE TESTED TO WITHSTAND THE TOUGHEST WEATHER 
THIS WAFER THIN FABRIC HAS A LOT GOING ON BETWEEN ITS LAYERS IT'S MADE UP OF THREE PARTS 
AN OUTER SHELL FOR STRENGTH A GORE TEX MEMBRANE WHICH KEEPS IT WATERPROOF AND BREATHABLE 
AND AN INNER SCRIM TO PROTECT THE GORE TEX FROM ABRASIONS 
THE WORLD'S YACHTSMEN BUY THESE AS SURVIVAL SUITS 
THEY CAN'T AFFORD ANY MISTAKES 
AT THE MOMENT THE B. T. GLOBAL CHALLENGE IS GOING ON 
EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN ON ALL FOURTEEN YACHTS IS WEARING OUR CLOTHING 
BY TALKING TO THAT VOLUME OF PEOPLE AND LOOKING AT THEIR CLOTHING 
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO LEARN A LOT FOR NEXT YEAR 
TO GET ROUND ANY LACK OF ELASTICITY IN THE FABRIC THE GARMENTS WERE 
TO DEVELOP A FABRIC LIKE THIS THE DESIGNERS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE PROPERTIES OF THE FIBRES 
COTTON FABRIC HAS POOR ELASTICITY AND CREASES BADLY BUT IT'S DURABLE EASY TO DYE AND WASHES WELL 
LINEN PRODUCES THICK DURABLE FABRICS THAT WASH AND DYE WELL BUT CREASES EASILY 
WOOL IS WARM SOFT AND ELASTIC BUT WHEN WASHED IT OFTEN SHRINKS 
SILK PRODUCES A SOFT FINE FIBRE THAT'S DURABLE AND EASY TO DYE 
POLYESTER HAS POOR ELASTICITY AND DOESN'T ACCEPT DYE WELL 
BUT IT WASHES WELL DRIPS DRY AND RESISTS CREASING IT'S MIXED WITH COTTON TO GAIN THE BENEFIT OF BOTH 
ACRYLIC IS MOSTLY USED AS A STAPLE FIBRE LIKE WOOL BUT IS NOT AS WARM AND DOESN'T TAKE WATER OR DYE WELL 
NYLON IS STRONG DURABLE WASHES AND DYES WELL AND IS CREASE RESISTANT 
THESE ARE USED TO MAKE LININGS VISCOSE IS CHEAP ACETATE DURABLE 
ONE LAST THING ABOUT FIBRES BE AWARE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES 
DON'T SPEND LOADS OF MONEY ON FILES GET SOME SHOEBOXES 
YOU SHOULD NOW UNDERSTAND FABRIC RAW MATERIAL 
BUT MOST FABRICS NEED TO UNDERGO FURTHER PROCESSING TO CHANGE THEIR APPEARANCE 
FABRICS CAN BE ENHANCED WITH COLOUR PATTERN TEXTURE THROUGH MANY PROCESSES 
INCLUDING DYEING PRINTING PAINTING AND STITCHWORK 
ONE OF THE SIMPLEST PROCESSES IS DYEING WITH FABRIC DYE OR PAINT 
A SOPHISTICATED METHOD OF DECORATING FABRIC IS SCREEN PRINTING 
HERE A FINE SHEET OF SILK IS PAINTED BEFORE FABRIC DYE IS SQUEEZED THROUGH THE SILK 
MATERIAL IS ONLY DYED WHERE THE RESIST PAINT ALLOWS IT TO PENETRATE 
THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE PATTERN 
NOW HAVE A LOOK AT THIS NEXT CLIP AND ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS 
FAITH SINGH WORKS CLOSELY WITH THESE THREE BROTHERS WHO RUN A FAMILY BUSINESS 
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAIN SUPPLIERS OF PRINTED FABRICS TO HER 
GETTING ON FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND METRES OF PRINTED FABRIC IS PRODUCED YEARLY USING THE MOST ANCIENT TECHNIQUES 
INDIA IS A COUNTRY WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARILY RICH IN TEXTILES 
IF YOU LOOK AT ANY ONE AREA YOU JUST START LOOKING AROUND AT THE TRADITIONAL TEXTILES 
YOU HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESOURCE TO WORK WITH 
FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS WE WORKED WITH WHAT WAS THERE LITTLE BY LITTLE WE INTRODUCED OUR OWN ELEMENTS 
AND EMPLOYED A FASHION DESIGNER DESIGNING CLOTHING FOR THE WEST I HAD NO FORMAL TRAINING IN THAT 
AS WE GREW WE NEEDED PROFESSIONALS 
NOW HERE THEY SEEM TO BE PRINTING WITH MUD WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE 
IT'S A RESIST PASTE WHICH IS MADE FROM MUD WHICH IS THICKENED WITH GUM 
AND SLATE LIME AND CLAY THE FOUR INGREDIENTS ARE MIXED TOGETHER 
A MAN SITS THERE'S TWO STAKES AND A CLOTH SLUNG BETWEEN THEM 
AND HE PUSHES IT THROUGH WITH HIS FEET THAT MAKES A VERY THICK STICKY VISCOUS PASTE 
THIS IS QUITE A CRUDE PASTE SO WE CAN'T DO FINE WORK IT'S BOLD AND SIMPLE 
AND HAVING GOT THAT RESIST ON YOU'D THEN OVERDYE THE FABRIC 
THEN YOU DYE IT AND WHEREVER THE RESIST PASTE WAS APPLIED YOU RETAIN THE ORIGINAL COLOUR 
IF YOU'RE DYEING WITH IRON THE REST GOES BROWNISH BLACK WITH INDIGO IT WILL GO BLUE 
YOU CAN GET ANY NUMBER OF PERMUTATIONS YOU CAN RESERVE WHITE LIGHT BLUE DARK BLUE GREEN 
IS THERE A DANGER THAT YOU HOLD THIS WHOLE COMMUNITY BACK FROM MOVING ON TO ON TO WHAT 
MAYBE MORE MECHANISATION MAYBE DOING THINGS SIMPLER NO SOME MECHANISATION IS DESIRABLE 
IF WE CAN INTRODUCE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF MECHANISATION IT WOULD BE FINE FOR EVERYBODY 
BUT ONE HAS TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL 
HOW DO YOU GIVE A DESIGN TO RASHID 
WE GIVE HIM AN ARTWORK USUALLY AND FROM THAT HE MAKES TRACINGS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SEPARATIONS 
THE SEPARATION IS WHERE EACH COLOUR IS ON A DIFFERENT BLOCK YES 
ONCE HE'S DECIDED ON THE SEPARATION WITH YOU AND THE DESIGNER WHAT THEN 
HE HAS TO TRACE IT ONTO TRACING PAPER SO THIS IS LIKE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
THAT COULD BE OFF AN ORIGINAL BIT OF FABRIC IT'S A TRADITIONAL FORM 
THAT'S BEEN TRACED BY RASHID WITH PENCIL 
AND THEN FROM THIS POINT HE THEN PUNCHES LITTLE TINY TINY HOLES DIRECTLY ONTO THE WOOD 
HE'S ACTUALLY TAKEN THIS PAPER HE'S PINNED IT TO THE WOOD 
AND HE'S PUNCHED MINUTE HOLES ONTO THE WOOD RIGHT 
SO THEN HE'S GOT THE DESIGN IN A PUNCHED FORM ON THE WOOD ITSELF 
AND NOW HE'S USING QUITE A BOLD TOOL WHICH IS ON HIS DRILL 
TO REMOVE ALL THE EXCESS WOOD FROM BETWEEN THE AREAS OF DESIGN 
HE'LL DO IT QUITE QUICKLY WHAT SORT OF WOOD IS IT HE'D BE USING 
FOR THE OUTLINE BLOCK WHICH IS VERY FINE THE WOOD NEEDS TO BE HARD 
HE'S USING A TYPE OF INDIAN TEAK 
OR ANOTHER WOOD WHICH IS YOUR ROSEWOOD 
HOW LONG WOULD A SET OF BLOCKS LAST YOU ONCE THEY'VE BEEN CREATED 
IT'S THE OUTLINE THAT WEARS OUT THE IN FILL BLOCKS ARE MUCH SIMPLER 
THIS IS THE IN FILL BLOCK FOR THIS OUTLINE RIGHT 
THIS BLOCK WILL WEAR OUT QUICKER IN SOME DETAILS 
ONCE YOU LOSE THE SHARPNESS OF THE OUTLINE YOU LOSE THE BEAUTY AND YOU HAVE TO RECARVE IT 
A FINE OUTLINE HANDLED PROPERLY MAY LAST ONE THOUSAND TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED METRES 
IF THEY WEAR OUT SO QUICKLY WHY DON'T THEY MAKE THEM IN METAL 
THERE'S NO TRADITION IN THIS AREA FOR MAKING THE BLOCKS IN METAL 
IT'S NOT A SKILL WHICH HAS FOUND ITS WAY OVER TO THIS PART OF INDIA 
THE PROCESS WAS REPEATED UNTIL THE DESIGN WAS COMPLETE 
YOU DON'T NEED TO USE TEAK FOAM RUBBER OR POLYSTYRENE CAN WORK 
THE SAME TECHNIQUES OF MARKING OUT YOUR PATTERN AND CARVING APPLY 
ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR FABRIC AND HOW IT'S BEEN TREATED 
YOU CAN BEGIN TO MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW TO CONSTRUCT YOUR DESIGN 
MOST TEXTILE PRODUCTS ARE AN ASSEMBLY OF FABRIC PIECES MAKING A THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPE 
A CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF TEXTILE DESIGN IS HOW TO BREAK DOWN A DESIGN INTO PIECES 
THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED INTO A PATTERN AND RE ASSEMBLED AS A SOLUTION 
THIS PRINCIPLE IS THE SAME NO MATTER WHAT PRODUCT YOU'RE MAKING 
BEFORE THE BALLOON IS MADE IT MUST BE DESIGNED 
STEVE WALLACE HAS DESIGNED FLYING PIPES SNOWMEN EVEN FLYING WITCHES BUT HE'S BEEN SET A NEW CHALLENGE 
IT'S AN ENERGY SAVING LIGHT BULB 
PHILIPS HAVE COME UP WITH THIS NEW LIGHT BULB THAT THEY WANT EVERYBODY TO BE AWARE OF 
SO THEY WANT A GIGANTIC LIGHT BULB SHAPED BALLOON THEY'VE MADE A DRAWING OF IT 
THIS IS WHAT THEY'D LIKE BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE CAN'T MAKE FLY 
FOR INSTANCE IF WE TRIED TO HAVE THE TUBES AS TALL AS THIS THEY'D ALL GO VERY FLOPPY 
WE'VE HAD TO MAKE SOME CHANGES LIKE MAKE THE TUBES SLIGHTLY SMALLER 
STEVE HAS TO PLAN EVERY DETAIL 
HUNDREDS OF FABRIC PANELS WILL HAVE TO BE SEWN TOGETHER TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB SHAPE 
BALLOONS ARE MADE FROM NYLON A SYNTHETIC FABRIC THAT IS BOTH LIGHT AND STRONG 
BUT MUCH OF ITS STRENGTH COMES FROM THE WAY IT'S WOVEN 
EVERY FEW MILLIMETRES THICKER FIBRES STOP RIPS AND TEARS 
AS BALLOONS HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE COMPLEX THEIR GEOMETRY HAS GOT MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND 
AND MORE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE WHAT THE FINAL SHAPE WILL LOOK LIKE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE USE TO SEE THE FINISHED BALLOON 
THE COMPUTER ALSO HELPS US WITH NUMEROUS CALCULATIONS WE MUST DO TO MAKE THE PANELS FIT TOGETHER 
LOUISA'S THE NEXT LINK IN THE CHAIN 
SHE TAKES THE COMPUTERISED DATA AND CONVERTS IT INTO FULL SIZED PATTERNS 
I TAKE HIS COMPUTER DISK AND PUT IT INTO OUR PLOTTING MACHINE 
IT'S VERY SLOW BUT IT DOES EACH PATTERN 
THE FABRIC IS CUT OUT USING THE PAPER PATTERNS AS A GUIDE 
EVERY ONE OF HUNDREDS OF PANELS MUST BE LABELLED TO SHOW EXACTLY WHERE IT GOES 
WITH THIS MUCH MATERIAL IT'S ESSENTIAL TO BE VERY ORGANISED 
THIS IS MY BIBLE ALL THE DESIGN SHEETS START OFF IN HERE 
I DO LOTS OF SCRIBBLES WORK OUT WHERE EVERYTHING GOES TOGETHER 
WHAT COLOURS IT'S GOT TO BE HOW MANY PANELS I NEED 
SO WHEN THEY'RE WORKING ON IT YOU CAN KEEP A GOOD TRACK OF IT ALL 
FOR STRENGTH EVERY SEAM IS SEWN WITH THE FABRIC DOUBLED OVER 
BY LAW HOT AIR BALLOONS MUST MEET THE SAME SAFETY STANDARDS AS JET PLANES 
SO THE JOINS BETWEEN PANELS ARE ALSO DOUBLE STITCHED 
BLOWING THE BALLOON UP WITH COLD AIR ALLOWS THEM TO CHECK THE SHAPE WITHOUT IT TAKING OFF 
WE'RE GENERALLY CONFIDENT IT'LL FLY 
THE THING YOU DOUBT IS WHETHER IT WILL LOOK QUITE AS IT'S INTENDED 
WE DO AS MANY CALCULATIONS AS WE CAN TO BE CONFIDENT IT WILL WORK 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN YOU HAVE MAYBE FIVE THOUSAND METRES OF FABRIC 
IT'S VERY NERVE RACKING 
I'VE NOT HAD A FAILURE YET BUT I LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR 
IT WAS CONSTRUCTED BY A TEAM OF THREE TWO SEWERS AND A TEAM LEADER 
IT WAS TESTED AND EVALUATED IN AN APPROPRIATE AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT 
HOT AIR BALLOONS MUST MEET THE SAME SAFETY STANDARDS AS JET PLANES 
BASIC CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES ARE TAKEN ONE STAGE FURTHER IN FASHION DESIGN 
FASHION DESIGN CAN BE FOR ANYTHING FROM COCKTAIL JACKETS TO ACCESSORIES AND BOOTS 
A KEY ELEMENT IN DESIGN SOLUTIONS IS THE IDEA OF A STORY 
A STORY INCLUDES DIFFERENT CO ORDINATES AND ACCESSORIES 
THIS HELPS TO MAXIMISE SALES 
IN THE NEXT CLIP HALE AND PACE ARE CHALLENGED TO DESIGN A STORY 
NOTE DOWN ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS 
THE TIME HAD COME TO SELL OUR IDEAS TO TOMASZ HIMSELF 
AT FIRST THERE HAD SEEMED NO HOPE SO WE WERE PREPARED FOR REJECTION 
THE IDEA IS TO GET THE BASIC SHAPE OF THE CURVE OF A WOMAN 
THE SKIRTS ARE OVERLAPPING PETALS 
I DON'T THINK THIS BUTTON IS PARTICULARLY WORKING AT THE MOMENT 
WE WANTED A ROSE DYING NICE SHAPE 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WILL SWING IS IT TOO HEAVY 
AS A BUTTON YEAH IT NEEDS WORK 
THE SECOND ONE IS INSPIRED BY THE TIFFANY LAMPS 
THEY WERE ON SCREENS THAT WE SAW ART NOUVEAU NO I LIKE THIS MORE 
WE WANTED TO REFLECT THIS IN THE EMBROIDERY OR A PANEL EFFECT 
AND ALSO TOM BECAUSE WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED OH NICE 
THERE'S A SELECTION WITH THAT KIND OF TIFFANY FEEL 
THAT'S LOVELY 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF ALL THESE CURVES 
WE HAVE TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY 
BECAUSE THE PRACTICALITY OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT MAY GAPE IT MAY NOT WORK 
YOU HAVE THIS ELEMENT OF EMBROIDERY IT COULD EVEN BE LACE THERE MAY BE A LACE LIKE THIS 
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT TIED IN WITH THE TAILORING 
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD WE DECIDED TO MAKE OUR JACKETS AND DRESSES IN RED AND NAVY 
USING A CREPE PINSTRIPE TO REALLY SHOW OFF THE TIFFANY DETAILS' 
WHAT I LIKE IS YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE BASIC PREMISE OF DRESS DESIGN 
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL IS TAKEN THE SPIRIT OF THE TIFFANY LAMP 
AND YOU'VE MADE IT YOUR OWN BY CHANGING IT AND CREATING IT IN EMBROIDERY AM I RIGHT 
YES WE DUMPED THE IDEA OF HAVING COLOURED PANELS LIKE THE LAMP THAT MIGHT BE TOO LITERAL 
YOU NEVER SAY YOU DUMPED AN IDEA 
YOU SAY YOU HAVE DEVELOPED THE IDEA 
DO YOU THINK THEY'VE GOT THE FEELING OF A STORY 
OH VERY MUCH SO LOOKING AT THESE DRAWINGS I GET A VERY COHERENT FEEL FROM THEM 
I CAN SEE THEM IN MATERIAL ON WOMEN COMING DOWN A RUNWAY AND SAYING SOMETHING 
IN THE CLICHE MAKING A STATEMENT 
WITHOUT TALENTED TECHNICIANS A FASHION DESIGNER IS LOST 
SO IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GET THE GREEN LIGHT 
FROM TOMASZ'S ASSISTANT MARK TABARD 
THEY'VE ANSWERED THE BRIEF PERFECTLY 
WE PARTICULARLY LIKED YOUR EMBROIDERY DESIGNS 
I HOPE OUR EMBROIDERER WORKS WITH IT 
ALL GARMENTS ARE INITIALLY MADE UP IN CALICO 
TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE LOOK SHAPE AND MOVEMENT THE DESIGNER INTENDS THESE ARE KNOWN AS TWALL 
NOW WE NEED TO MAKE THIS LOOK AS MUCH LIKE YOUR DRAWING AS POSSIBLE 
FOR INSTANCE THE COLLAR CURVE 
COULD YOU MOVE ROUND A MINUTE 
I LIKE IT I RECKON IT COULD BE EVEN MORE CURVED GARETH 
I THINK IT FEELS LIKE IT NEEDS TO COME MORE ACROSS YEAH 
WE CAN DO THAT HE'S DRAWING ON IT I KNOW IT LOOKED REALLY NICE 
THERE'S AN INNOCENCE ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THE EXPERIENCE IT'S VERY FRESH AND EXCITING 
AND IT REMINDS US THAT SOMETIMES WE'RE A BIT TOO CONTRIVED 
THIS IS THE DRESS WITH THE EMBROIDERY ALL ROUND THE HEM 
I THINK THIS WOULD LOOK REALLY GOOD 
THERE 
I'M VERY CURIOUS TO SEE THE POWER IT WILL HAVE WITHIN THE RANGE 
ALL OF IT IS LOOKING GOOD LET'S SEE IT ALL PUT TOGETHER 
I'M NOT PROMISING THAT EVERYTHING WILL GO IN BUT THEY'VE GOT A GOOD CHANCE OF GETTING A LOT IN 
NINE A M. ON THE BIG DAY THE SHOW WOULD BEGIN AT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE BALL GOWNS 
TOMASZ WAS IN FULL FLIGHT THE THIRD STORY WOULD BE EIGHT OUTFITS DESIGNED BY US' 
HALE AND PACE PRESENTED TWO STORIES 
HAVE A GO ON YOUR OWN 
HERE ARE A FEW IDEAS 
SO HERE'S OUR CHECKLIST FOR TEXTILE TECHNOLOGY 
IT HELPS TO START WELL IN ADVANCE 
IT'S EASY TO PUT IT OFF BUT IF YOU START EARLY IT REALLY DOES HELP 
YOU SHOULD NOW BE FEELING A LOT MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT RESISTANT MATERIALS 
SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS AND TEXTILE TECHNOLOGY 
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT ALREADY YOU MUST GO BACK AND WATCH D. AND AMP T. ONE 
FOR VITAL SKILLS YOU'LL NEED FOR WHATEVER FOCUS AREA YOU STUDY 
YOU'LL NEED TO WATCH THE DESIGNING AND MAKING SECTION 
WHICH SHOWS HOW TO MAKE ANY PRODUCT EFFECTIVELY 
GRAPHIC PRODUCTS HELPS DRAWING SKILLS FOOD TECHNOLOGY SHOWS YOU HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS 
OUR CASE STUDIES OFFER REAL LIFE SOLUTIONS TO DESIGN CHALLENGES HERE'S A QUICK TASTER 
THE BOOK WILL ALSO PROVIDE YOU WITH REVISION EXERCISES TO DO 
AND HERE'S A REMINDER OF THE WEB ADDRESS FOR THE BITESIZE SITE 
OH AND FINALLY GOOD LUCK IN YOUR EXAMS 
THE LORD MAY HAVE HIS FAVOURITES BUT ON SATURDAY YOU DIDN'T AGREE 
KEISHA IS NOT DANCING THIS IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER TRAVESTY 
I'M ANGRY 
YOU DECIDE YES 
WHO COULD STILL BE NANCY
