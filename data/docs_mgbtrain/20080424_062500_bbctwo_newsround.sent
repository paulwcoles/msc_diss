HI THERE 
FIRST UP IS YOUR SCHOOL CLOSED FOR 
THE DAY THOUSANDS OF LESSONS HAVE 
BEEN CANCELLED ACROSS ENGLAND AND 
WALES BECAUSE OF A STRIKE BY 
TEACHERS THEY ARE PROTESTING ABOUT 
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY GET PAID 
HERE IS WHAT SOME OF YOU THINK 
I THINK THE STRIKE IS A GOOD IDEA 
BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW US TO CATCH 
UP WITH HER FRIENDS AND THE 
TEACHERS TO GET SOME MORE MONEY 
I THINK IT IS GREAT BECAUSE I GET 
AT DAY OFF AND I MAY GO TO MY 
FRIEND'S HOUSE 
IT IS GOOD ON ONE HAND BECAUSE WE 
GET TO PLAY FOOTBALL AND 
PLAYSTATION BUT IT IS BAD BECAUSE 
CHILDREN MISS OUT ON THEIR LEARNING

IDEA BECAUSE I USUALLY THE OF 
THURSDAYS THURSDAYS THE STRIKE IS GOOD ALTHOUGH IT 
OTHER WE HAVE JUST HAD A HOLIDAY 
IT IS GOOD TO GET A DAY OFF ONCE IN 
A WHILE TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS 
YOU CAN TELL US WHAT DO YOU THINK
