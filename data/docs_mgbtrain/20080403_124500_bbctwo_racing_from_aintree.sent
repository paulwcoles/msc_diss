INGLIS DREVER IS NICKNAMED POP EYE 
BECAUSE HIS EYES STAND OUT A BIT

WELL AT CHELTENHAM AND HE SEEMS SO 
WELL IN HIMSELF I THOUGHT I WOULD 
BRING HIM BACK TO AINTREE 
HE DID 
SO WELL IN THE HURDLES 
YES HE DID 
AND I FEEL THAT THE HORSE WILL TELL 
US WHEN HE'S FINISHED RACING SO HE 
LOOKS SO WELL I THOUGHT WE WOULD 
BRING HIM BACK HERE 
HE HASN'T WON 
AT AINTREE 
NOT BUT IT IS MORE OF 
A STAMINA TEST THAN SPEED SO 
WE'LL SEE WHAT HE DOES TODAY AND AND THE BIG DAY DAY 
I HAVE SOME LOVELY 
HORSES SO LET'S HELP THEY ALL DO 
WELL

MCCOY RELAXED AND SMILING AND 
YOUNG SCUDAMORE EATING AWAY AND 
CHOCOLATE THORNTON HE'S ON THE 
GREAT D'ARGENT AND THESE ARE SOME 
OF THE OBSTACLES THEY HAVE TO JUMP 
THE CANAL TURN

SPECTACLE WATCHING THIS EVENT AND 
THE RACE HAS COME ON SO MUCH THE

ARE YOU UP GANTRY WHEN YOU'RE COMMENTATING 
A LITTLE BIT ONLY FIFTEEN COMMENTATING FEET NOT TOO BAD

THE WIND 
NO IT'S QUITE STURDY 
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M IN IT THESE ARE THE RUNNERS AND RIDERS FOR THE FIRST RACE BLAZING BAILEY WEARING BLINKERS FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE THE ELEVEN RUNNERS IN OUR OPENER OPENER WELL INGLIS DREVER WAS PUT IN AT 
ELEVEN ELEVEN KICKS FOR FREE WENT FROM SEVEN TO ONE TO NINE TO TWO AS WE SPEAK A FIFTY THOUSAND AT SIX TO FOUR HAS 
JUST BEEN STRUCK BEHIND ME INGLIS 
DREVER THE FAVOURITE 
ALAN KING WITH BLAZING BAILEY HAS 
THE UNENVIABLE TASK OF HAVING TO 
LOWER INGLIS DREVER COLOURS ONCE 
AGAIN ALAN YOU'VE BEEN BEHIND 
INGLIS DREVER ON A NUMBER OF 
OCCASIONS YOU HAVE GOT THE BETTER 
OF HIM ONCE OR TWICE WHAT ARE THE 
CHANCES OF BLAZING BAILEY GETTING 
THE BETTER OF HIM ON THIS COURSE 
TODAY 
WE ALWAYS HAVE A BETTER TODAY CHANCE THAN AT CHELTENHAM L. LOT 
DEPENDS ON THE BLINKERS L. MEAN 
HE'S THOROUGHLY GENUINE BUT I JUST 
THOUGHT WE'D SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
WERE YOU PLEASED WITH HIM AT 
CHELTENHAM HE SEEMED TO RUN O. K. 
BUT I SUSPECT YOU THOUGHT HE MIGHT 
HAVE GOT A LITTLE CLOSER THAN THAT 
HE SEEMED TO LOSE HIS PLACE AT THE 
TOP OF THE HILL HE WAS A LONG WAY 
BEHIND AND HE DID WELL TO FINISH 
FOURTH RUBY HAD NERVER RIDDEN HIM 
BEFORE AND HE TAKES A WEE BIT OF 
KNOWING WE'LL SEE WE DON'T WANT A 
REPEAT OF LAST YEAR WHEN HE GOT ON 
THE FLOOR WE'LL SEE INGLIS DREVER 
IS A HUGE HORSE AND O. K. THIS 
PROBABLY ISN'T HIS TRACK BUT HE 
STILL SETS THE STANDARD AND AND DARGEYONT WHAT IS THE LATEST NEWS 
ON HIM 
D'ARGENT 
WELL I DON'T KNOW WE'VE PUT THE 
BLINKERS ON AND SINCE THEN HE'S 
JUMPED LOT BETTER DON'T REALLY 
KNOW I THINK WE'LL KNOW OUR FATE 
REALLY QUICK LEAF 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH BOTH NORMAN AND I WERE NOT 
IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY KICKS FOR 
FREE LOOKED IN THE PADDOCK HE HAS 
BEEN BACKED AND HE COULD GIVE THE 
FAVOURITE A RUN BUT I THOUGHT HE 
LOOKED DRY IN HIS COAT 
YES THIS 
HORSE LOOKS LIGHT AND SWEATY BEHIND 
THE SADDLE BUT HE RAN A CRACKING 
RACE AT SHELTHAM HE WAS ELEVEN STONE 
AND CARRYING A HANDICAP AND RUBY 
WILL PROBABLY RUN HIM THE SAME WAY 
BUT THERE IS A WORRY THAT THE RACE 
COULD HAVE LEFT HIM WANTING WHERE WHERE AS BLAZING BAILEY LOOKS FANTASTIC 
AND INGLIS DREVER 
YES HE IS NINE 
NOW AND THEY WERE HINTING THAT THEY 
COULD RETIRE HIM 
WELL YOU CAN'T 
DO MANY MORE THINGS THAN WIN THREE 
RACES AT CHELTENHAM FOR YOU THE 
TRACK IS AGAINST HIM HIS OWNER 
SAYS HE HAS WON HERE BUT IT WAS 
ONE OF HIS FIRST RACES PEOPLE ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT HOW MUCH CHELTENHAM 
TOOK OUT OF HIM AND IT IS WHETHER 
HE CAN SHOW WELL TODAY 
AND THE 
POINT IS THIS IS FLAT AND IN 
CHELTENHAM WHERE HE FIGHTS BACK ON 
THE HILL THE HILL BRINGS THE BEST 
OUT OF HIM 
YES AND IF HE HITS A 
FLAT SPOT IN HIS RACES THAT COULD 
BE FOUND OUT ON 
A SHARP 
TRACK LIKE 
THIS 
AND LOUGH DERG COULD RUN THIS TWICE HERE HE IS THE ONE WITH THE 
ORANGE SLEEVES AND THE GREEN AND 
WHITE QUARTER BUT HE COULD RUN 
AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE ORDER OF 
MERITS 
YES HE HAS EIGHTY SIX POINTS IN MERITS THE ORDER OF MERITS IN FRONT OF 
HIM IS KAUTO STAR SO THEY'RE 
TRYING TO GET AS MANY POINTS AS 
POSSIBLE BUT HONESTLY HE'S 
PROBABLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH IF INGLIS

CONGRATULATIONS CHOCOLATE WHAT A 
GREAT RIDE L. BET THERE WERE TIMES 
WHEN YOU WERE SLIGHTLY CONCERNED 
THAT HE WAS LETTING IT GET AWAY 
FROM HIM 
I WAS WORRIED WHEN I 
MISSED THE LAST DOWN THE BACK HE 
GOT A LITTLE BIT TIGHT AND HE FELL 
THERE LAST YEAR FOR SIMILAR REASONS 
I LOST PROBABLY TWO OR THREE 
LENGTHS THERE BUT ONCE I GOT HIM 
OUT AND GOT A BIT OF LIGHT HE'S 
THE TYPE OF HORSE THAT THE MORE YOU 
ASK THE BETTER HE'LL DO 
ONE OF THE 
THINGS HE HAS A LOT OF COURAGE AND 
GUTS BECAUSE HE WAS UP AGAINST IT 
FROM SOME WAY OUT 
YES HE WAS A 
PIT ON AND OFF ALL THE WAY BUT THE 
GROUND IS BEAUTIFUL ON THE SLOW 
SIDE BUT PERFECT GROUND YES HE'S 
MADE HARD WORK OF IT BUT YOU DON'T 
MIND BECAUSE HE GIVES YOU WHAT YOU 
ASK 
A GREAT START TO THE MEETING ASK AND LOTS OF GOOD RIDES TO LOOK 
FORWARD TO A QUICK WORD ABOUT 
D'ARGENT HAVE YOU SAT ON HIM 
RECENTLY 
YES I SCORED HIM ON RECENTLY MONDAY HE KIND OF HAS HIS OWN WAY 
OF DOING THINGS JUMPING WISE AND 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT 
BUT HE'S IN GOOD FORM 
GOOD RIDER AND ENVIABLE MULLET 
HAIRCUT THE RACE WE SAW VARIOUS 
INCIDENTS AND THIS IS ONE WORTH 
LOOKING AT FOUR FROM HOME THEY ARE COMING TO THE BEND THE 
RUNNING RAIL THEY TO KAWAGINO 
WAS THERE HE WAS MAYBE GOING FOR A 
GAP THAT WASN'T THERE 
NOW THIS BEND HORSES RUN OFF A 
BEND LITTLE GASPARA IN FRONT SHE 
IS ONLY TINY BUT GAME AS A PEBBLE 
IN A MINUTE THEY ALL COME TOGETHER 
DON'T THEY 
THEY DO THEY DIDN'T GO 
A PARTICULARLY STRONG GALLOP IN 
THIS AS A RESULT THEY FINISHED A 
BIT IN A HEAP BLAZING BAILEY AND 
ALAN KING SAYING HE HIT A FLAT SPOT 
DID SO DID LING AND LOUGH DERG BUT 
THEY BOTH GOT INTO IT EVENTUALLY 
SO DID INGLIS DREVER 
NOW I THOUGHT THAT WASING TO TO BE 
A CHAMPION HURDLE HORSE BUT HE WAS 
OUT OF CHARACTER 
YES HE WANTED TO 
GO SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT ALL THE TIME 
TO KEEP HIS INTEREST 
AND THE 
FOURTH HORSE HOME BALLYFITZ WHEN 
JIM IN COVENTRY SAID THAT HE HAD 
HIS WHIP IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE 
MEANT HIS RIGHT HAND NOT CORRECT 
HAND THE HORSE WENT AWAY FROM THE 
STICK JIM IN COMMENTARY HE HE JUMPED THE LAST AS A TERRIBLE ANGLE 
AND WAS STRUGGLING TO STAY ON THE 
HORSE HAD A BIG ATTITUDE BUT 
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T THE BIG HILL 
HE COULDN'T GRAB THE OTHER THAT THAT JUMP WAS A GUESS FLAT OUT UP HE 
COMES IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY 
DIFFERENCE THOUGH SO A GOOD RACE 
TO START 
OF COURSE WE ARE ALL LOOKING 
FORWARD TO SATURDAY THIS MORNING 
DECLARATIONS FOR THE JOHN SMITH'S 
GRAND NATIONAL WERE TAKEN TWO 
HORSES DROPPED OUT

HORSE NORMAN WILLIAMSON ALONGSIDE 
ME A CRUCIAL PART OF OUR TEAM BUT 
WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY MAN WHO HAS 
WON THE GRAND NATIONAL TWICE THE 
GOLD CUP AND CHAMPION HURDLE AND 
BEEN CHAMPION JOCKEY THREE TIMES 
AND WHEN HE WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP 
RACE RIDING BECAUSE OF AN INJURED 
SHOULDER HE TWITCHED HIS ATTENTION 
TO DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND HAS 
RECENTLY BEEN ON SNOW PATROL EXPLAIN WHAT WE ARE DOING THE 
CONDITIONING IT IS THE STUFF I DID 
BEFORE THE SOUTH POLE YOU WOULD BE 
DOING THIS UP TO PROBABLY FOUR OR 
FIVE HOURS A DAY WAS A BIT SLACK I. N. MY TRAINING AS FAR AS PULLING 
TYRES WAS CONCERNED BUT I DID 
LOT OF RUNNING AROUND RICHMOND 
LOT OF RUNNING AROUND RICHMOND YOU PULL A TYRE AROUND RICHMOND YOU 
GET FUNNY LOOKS 
CAN WE STOP NOW 
I THINK WE SHOULD WE DON'T WANT TO 
DO YOUR BACK IN 
WELL IT IS A FUN THING TO DO I 
SUPPOSE 
IT IS A REAL FUN BUT IT IS SUPPOSE NECESSARY YOU REALLY HAVE TO BUILD 
UP YOUR CORE MUSCLES 
DO YOU THINK 
YOU ARE STRONGER AND FITTER NOW 
THAN WHEN YOU WERE RIDING 
I WOULD 
SAY UNTIL HALF WAY THROUGH THE 
EXPEDITION AND THEN REALLY THE 
WEIGHT DROPPED OFF ME L. CAME TO 
HEAVY BEFORE IT ABOUT TWELVE AND A 
HALF STONE L. GOT DOWN TO PROBABLY 
A RACING WEIGHT AND AMP WILL AND WHEN I 
CAME BACK I WAS NINE AND A HALF 
STONE L. WAS PRETTY DISGUSTING BY THE TIME I HAD FINISHED 
I FELT EVERY OUNCE OF ME 
SCREAMING OUT 
BUT THE SOUND WAS TRAPPED DEEP IN 
ME 
I WAS ABSOLUTELY STARVING

SOME PEOPLE 
THOUGHT MAYBE THE GROUND DIDN'T

ON THE DAY WHO WAS BETTER THAN HIM

REASON FOR HIM NOT TO BE HERE HE 
WOULDN'T BE HERE THEY HAVE ALL 
BEEN HAPPY WITH HIM HE IS BETTER 
OFF HERE THAN HE IS IN HIS STABLE 
AND GUNGADU IN THE SAME COLOURS AS 
DENMAN 
HE'S A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB ON DENMAN HANDICAP MARKS BUT YOU NEVER KNOW 
HE DIDN'T TO CHELTENHAM HE HAS 
KEPT ON CREEPING UP HE NEEDS A 
CAREER BEST BY A LONG WAY TO WIN 
BUT YOU CAN NEVER TELL 
PLENTY OF 
PEOPLE STILL SHOUTING FOR KAUTO 
STAR TODAY 
I THINK THEY ARE RIGHT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WELL KAUTO STAR HAS BEEN PUT THE EIGHT 
THIRTEEN FAVOURITE I HAVE BEEN JOINED BY GARY FROM 
TOTESPORT THE FIRST FAVOURITE HAS 
GOT BEAT WHAT DO YOU THINK FOR 
THIS ONE 
THERE WASN'T ANY MONEY 
FOR THE FIRST FAVOURITE THE 
BOOKIES CHASED IT OUT THIS RACE IS 
DIFFERENT ALL THE PUNTERS ARE 
COMING IN FOR KAUTO STAR WE HAD A 
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TO WIN AND ONE THOUSAND TO SIX TO ONE 
THE PUNTERS WANT TO BE WITH THIS 
ONE BUT THEY NEVER WANTED TO BE 
WITH INGLIS DREVER THE PUNTERS 
WANT TO BE WITH THIS ONE YOU ARE 
OBVIOUSLY A BACK MAKER AND A 
PUNTER TOO 
AND YOU CAN HAVE AN 
OPINION IF YOU HAD YOUR MONEY ON 
WOULD YOU BACK AT EIGHT TO THIRTEEN 
I WOULD 
HAVE DONE BUT AFTER THE FIRST RACE 
INGLIS DREVER RAN FLAT L. THINK THE 
CHELTENHAM AFFECTED IT HERE WOULD 
YOU WANT TO GO INTO THIRTEEN TO EIGHT ON L. 
THINK HE IS TOO SHORT IF I WAS 
GOING TO GO FOR A BIT OF VALUE OR 
SMALL HORSE I WOULD GO WITH GUNGADU 
TO TURN OVER AND PAUL NICHOLLS' 
JACKET A DIFFERENT CLASS 
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY YEAH HERE IN THE POD DOCK WE HAVE 
BEEN LOOKING AT THE HORSES KAUTO 
STAR HOW DO YOU THINK HE LOOKS I I DIDN'T THINK HE LOOKED GREAT 
NORMAN BUT I HAVE HEARD HE DOESN'T 
LOOK THE 
HIS RACES 
CERTAINLY THE PICK OF THE PADDOCK I 
THOUGHT WAS EXOTIC DANCER AND ALSO 
OUR VIC L. THOUGHT HE LOOKED VERY 
WELL FOR A HORSE THAT HAS RUN AT 
CHELTENHAM CARRYING PLENTY OF 
CONDITION FOR ONE OF SKAP PIPEY'S 
KAUTO STAR LOOKS HAPPY ENOUGH HE 
LOOKS LIKE HE HAS BATHE OF 
CONDITION HIS COAT IS STILL A 
FRACTION DRY BUT LOOKS REASONABLY 
WELL FOR A HORSE THAT HAD HARD 
RACE BUT I AGREE OUR VIC WAS THE 
PICK OF THE PADDOCK HE LOOKS 
TREMENDOUS LOOKING FORWARD TO GREAT RACE WELCOME BACK IT THE STUDIO I HAVE 
ANDREW THORNTON YOU SAY DUNWOODY 
IS MAD WHAT ABOUT YOU YOU CAN'T 
WAIT TO DO IT AGAIN YOU ROAD SIMON 
IN THE NATIONAL AND FELL AT THE 
TWENTY FIFTH NOW HERE YOU ARE THESE THESE THINGS HAPPEN I'M GOING TO BE OFF 
FOR SIX MONTHS BUT AS RICHARD SAID 
I'LL COME BACK 
AND YOU ARE PLAYING 
WITH YOUR BALL YOUR PLASTER SEEN 
TO KEEP YOU MOBILE 
I HAVE TO KEEP 
THE MUSCLES MOVING AND KEEP 
EVERYTHING GOING THINGS ARE COMING 
ON THE RIGHT WAY 
WELL MOBILE IS 
EXOTIC DANCER HE WON THIS RACE TWELVE 
MONTHS AGO HE IS GOING DOWN THERE 
I SAW HIS OWNER COMING IN SIR 
ROBERT ALTMAN AND HE SAID IT IS A 
HEARD RACE TO TURN AROUND 
IT IS 
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR HIM A 
BELOW PAR PERFORMANCE IN THE 
CUP HE IS COMING BACK TO TRY TO 
REDEEM HIS REPUTATION L. LOOKED AT 
HIM IN THE PADDOCK L. THOUGHT KAUTO 
STAR LOOKED BETTER IN HIS COAT THAN 
HE DID AT CHELTENHAM EXOTIC DANCER 
DID LOOK VERY WELL HE OBVIOUSLY 
HAS THE FORM TO TURN AROUND WITH 
KAUTO STAR HE HAS YET TO BEAT HIM 
BUT TONY MCCOY BACK ON BOARD TODAY 
HE WILL BE KEEPING HE PUTS IN A 
DECENT RUN 
O. K. BUT NOW GREY HORSES 
PEOPLE LOVE THEM MONET'S GARDEN 
HE LOVES THIS COURSE AND HE DOES IT 
WELL HE HAS BEATEN KAUTO STAR HERE 
BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST RUN OF THE 
SEASON BACK IN NOVEMBER WASN'T IT 
THAT'S RIGHT HE WAS RECEIVING 
LOT OF WEIGHT THAT DAY OVER 
DIFFERENT TRIP AS WELL THAT WAS 
TWO MILES FIVE HE IS UP TO THREE 
MILE ONE OVER FENCES FOR THE FIRST 
TIME TODAY THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY 
FEELING THAT THE STEP UP IN TRIP 
MIGHT JUST HELP HIS CAUSE THEY HAD 
THE CHOICE OF TAKING ON SKAFT 
MASTERMINDED TOMORROW OR KAUTO STAR 
TODAY THEY PLUMPED FOR TODAY 
TAKING ON MASTERMINDED HE LOOKS 
LIKE A HORSE THAT GOES WELL FRESHED 
THAT'S WHAT HE HAS HE HASN'T BEEN 
TO CHELTENHAM HE DOESN'T HAVE TO 
WORRY ABOUT THAT HE IS COMING HERE 
TODAY LOOKING LIKE THERE IS 
PROBABLY THREE HOLD UP HORSES 
EXOTIC DANCER KAUTO STAR AND 
GUNGADU YOU FEEL THAT OUR VIC WILL 
RUN AWAY AND MONET'S GARDEN WILL 
PROBABLY TRACK HIM 
HE HAS WON TWO 
HERE AND BEEN SECOND 
NOW OUR VIC WHO IS AN ENIGMA VERY 
IMPRESSIVE LAST TIME BUT CAN WE 
ALWAYS TRUST HIM TO DO HIS BEST I I THINK THE THREE MILE ONE AND A HALF 
AT CHELTENHAM STRETCHES YOUR 
STAMINA HE GETS TO THE LAST FENCE 
THERE AND DOESN'T COME UP THE HILL 
TWO MILE FIVE AROUND THERE AS IT 
PROVED AT CHET NAM IS TAILOR MADE 
FOR HIM THE BLINKERS WORKED A 
TREAT AT CHELTENHAM 
HE HAS BEEN SHARPENED UP HE 
RELAXED IN FRONT AND GOT AN EASY 
LEAD AND GALLOPED THEM INTO THE 
GROUND THAT DAY A FLAT FRAK TODAY 
WILL HELP HIM IF HE GETS A FLAT 
TRACK TODAY WILL HELP HIM AND IF HE 
GETS THE EASY LEAD HE COULD BE THE 
ONE TO BEAT 
GUNGADU HAS A LOT TO DO ON THE 
OFFICIAL WEIGHTS BUT FIVE HORSE RACE

HAS WON TWO HAND CAPS AT SANDOWN

INTERESTING RUBY SHOULD DO THIS BUT 
HE HAS SHOWN HE STAYED AND TONY 
MCCOY ON EXOTIC DANCER HAS 
TRAVELLED AND JUMPED WELL AND IS 
CREEPING IN BESIDE HIM IF I WAS 
TIMMY MURPHY I WOULDN'T BE HAPPY 
ABOUT RUBY SNEAKING UP HIS INNER

HAS TO TURN IT INTO A TEST DOWN THE 
BACK 
HE HE CERTAINLY IS KAUTO BACK HE STAR THE NEARSIDE HE WRAPPED THAT 
HARD KAUTO STAR HE GOT RIGHT INTO

THE FIGHT AGAIN NOW ON THE OUTSIDE 
HE IS ONLY A HALF LENGTH AWAY FOUR 
LENGTHS THEN TO EXOTIC DANCER 
LONG BACK MONET'S GARDEN WITH

THE LEFT ON THE NEARSIDE OUR VIC 
THEY COME TO FOUR OUT AND HE WENT 
THROUGH THAT KAUTO STAR IT IS LIKE

NECK IN FRONT AS THEY COME AROUND 
THE TURN ON THE FARSIDE IT IS OUR

THEY ARE STRIDE FOR STRIDE A GREAT 
BATTLE SIX OR EIGHT LENGTHS TO

LENGTHS AND HE COMES TO IT OH A BIG 
ONE HE TOOK OFF HE TOOK OFF FAR 
TOO EARLY AND HE HAS GOT ON TO THE 
TOP OF THE FENCE THERE BUT HE IS 
STILL IN FRONT SO KAUTO STAR WITH

FIVE LENGTHS IN FRONT THEN ON THE 
OUTSIDE OUR VIC EXOTIC DANCER 
RAISING AN EFFORT THEY HAVE ONE 
LEFT TO JUMP HE IS OUT ON HIS FEET 
KAUTO STAR HE CAN BARELY LIFT HIS

RACE TOWARDS THE LINE LOCKED 
TOGETHER A PHOTO OUR VIC AND 
KAUTO STAR A GAP THEN TO EXOTIC 
DANCER THERE FOLLOWED BY MONET'S 
GARDEN AND GUNGADU WHAT AN 
EXTRAORDINARY RACE AN ABSOLUTELY 
EXTRAORDINARY RACE 
AND LET'S JUST SEE IF WE CAN HAVE A 
LOOK AT THE PHOTO THERE AND LOOK AT 
RUBY RUBY TIMMY MURPHY THERE ON OUR VIC HE'S 
GOT UP THAT'S THE QUESTION BUT 
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY TACTICAL 
BATTLE YOU HAVE EVER SEEN WELL 
OVER CIRCUIT OUT RUBY WALSH GOT 
UP ON THE INSIDE OF TIMMY MURPHY 
AND THEY WENT HAMMER AND TONGS AT 
IT THEN DOWN THE BACK HE MADE A 
MISTAKE HE DROPPED OUT HE CAME 
BACK AGAIN HERE IS THE RESULT FIRST NUMBER FOUR OUR VIC OUR 
VIC HAS WON IT 
OUR VIC ON THE OUTSIDE HAS GOT UP 
TO WIN FOR TIMMY MURPHY THAT WILL 
GO DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS AS ONE 
OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY TACTICAL 
BATTLES YOU HAVE EVER SEEN KAUTO 
STAR HIS JUMPING WENT TO PIECES 
DOWN THE BACK HE GOT BACK INTO THE 
RACE THROUGH SHEER CLASS AND 
THROUGH THE SHEER DETERMINATION OF 
HIS JOCKEY RUBY WALSH BUT YOU 
COULD SEE HE WAS OUT ON HIS FEET 
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT ON HIS FEET 
HE LANDED ON THE TOP OF THE SECOND 
LAST AND THEN HIS JUMPING HAD GONE 
TO PIECES COMPLETELY BUT TIMMY 
MURPHY HAS WON THIS ON OUR VIC A 
REJUVENATED OUR VIC THE OWNER IS 
DAVID JOHNSTON TRAINER DAVID PIPE 
NINE TO ONE OUR VIC KAUTO STAR THE FOUR TO SEVEN 
FAVOURITE AND EXOTIC DANCER THE 
ONE TWO THREE AND A NOSE AND FOURTEEN 
LENGTHS WERE THE OFFICIAL DISTANCES 
ONLY A NOSE SEPARATING THEM THERE 
AT THE END IT LOOKED AS IF KAUTO 
STAR HAVING BEEN ON AND OFF THE 
BRIDLE THROUGHOUT THE RACE HE WENT 
TO THE FRONT IT LOOKED LIKE HE HAD 
THE RACE AT HIS MERSEY LOOK ATM 
MISTAKE IT IS THE SORT OF MISTAKE 
HE USED TO MAKE HE LANDS ON TOP OF 
THE FENCE SPLITS THE BIRCH HE IS 
THREE LENGTHS AHEAD IT KNOCKS THE 
STUFFING OUT OF HIM IT MAY HAVE 
HURT HIM HE LOOKS PUNCH DRUNK 
AFTER THAT RICHARD DUNWOODY I WAS 
WORRYING AS HE CAME DOWN TO THE 
LAST HE MANAGES TO GET OVER THAT 
GUTS AND BRAVERY I THINK HAVE GOT 
HIM HOME TODAY TO BE ONLY BEATEN A 
NOSE RATHER THAN CLASS OUR VIC IS 
A VERY GOOD HORSE BUT THIS WAS AN 
EXTRAORDINARY RACE TO WATCH 
AMAZING A REAL AMAZING RACE AT 
THE SECOND LAST RUBY HAS GIVE HIM A 
BIT OF THE OFFICE TO COME UP LONG 
IT HAS BEEN AN EFFORT FROM THAT HE 
HAS BEEN TIRED GOING TO THE LAST 
HERE YOU HAVE SEEN HIS REAL 
BATTLING QUALITIES HE HAS REALLY 
STUCK IT OUT HOPED HE WAS GOING 
TO HANG ON FOR RUBY BUT OUR VIC HAS 
COLLARED HIM ON THE LINE 
A SUCCESS 
FOR TIMMY MURPHY AND DAVID PIPE 
OUR VIC A HORSE THAT WON AT 
CHELTENHAM HE LOOKED MAGNIFICENT 
IN THE PADDOCK BEFORE THE RACE IT 
IS ALL WELL SAYING THAT AFTERWARDS 
BUT TIMMY MURPHY HAD TO GET HIM 
INTO A RHYTHM HE MADE A MISTAKE AT 
THE FIRST JUMPED THE SECOND BIG 
THEN HE WAS INTO A RHYTHM THEN 
KAUTO STAR TOOK HIM ON AND THERE IS 
DAVID PIPE THE SUCCESSFUL TRAINER 
IT IS A GREAT MOMENT FOR HIM I'M SURE YOU HAD THOUGHT KAUTO STAR 
TOOK COMMAND OF THE RACE BUT YOUR 
HORSE FOUGHT BACK SO BRIEFLY 
ABSOLUTELY BOTH HORSES FOUGHT 
BRAVELY AND HE GOT IT IN THE DYING 
STAGE 
HOW CONCERNED WERE YOU WHEN STAGE KAUTO STAR STARTED TAKING HIM ON 
FOR THE LEAD 
I WAS ALWAYS HAPPEN 
UNTIL THE HOME STRAIGHT AND KAUTO 
WENT ON THE BLIJERS HAVE 
DEFINITELY HELPED AND SHARPENED HIM 
UP BLINKERS 
WILL THIS BE THE ONLY TRACK WHERE 
HE'LL DO THREE MILES 
HE TWELVE IT AT 
WETHERBY BUT HE'S BEEN A GOOD 
HORSE ALL HIS LIFE THE HEAD RIDER 
WHO RIDES HIM EVERY DAY SAID HE 
WAS A GREAT HORSE AND WE'RE GOING 
TO MISS HIM WHEN HE GIVES UP 
AND DAVID JOHNSON SHAKING HANDS 
WITH TIMMY MURPHY THE WINNING 
OWNER AND SHEER ELATION FOR TIMMY 
MURPHY SO HOW LOWS WAS IT LET'S HAVE A 
LOOK AT IT AND THERE THEY ARE ON 
THE OUTSIDE 
IT'S OUR VIC ON AND AN THE FAR SIDE 
KAUTO STAR AND THE JUDGE'S PRINT 
SHOWED A NOSE THAT IS AN 
OFFICIAL DISTANCE NOW A NOSE IN 
THE OWED OLDEN DAYS SHORT HEAD 
WAS THE NARROWEST MARGIN BUT NOW 
IT IS NOSE AND KAUTO STAR LET'S 
HAVE LOOK AT HIM HE'S BATTLED 
HARD AND RUBY WALSH WHEN HE SAW 
THAT INSIDE OPENING THAT WAS UP 
THE STRAIGHT THE FIRST TIME AT 
ABOUT THE NINTH OR TENTH HE TOOK 
THE INSIDE OPENING AND THEN THE 
RACE WAS REALLY ON A LONG LONG 
WAY FROM HOME HE SURGED BACK INTO CONTENTION 
AGAIN DOWN THE BACK AND NOW PAUL 
NICHOLLS WHO TRAINS KAUTO STAR 
HAS NOW CROSSED THE THREE MILLION 
PRIZE MONEY MARK WHICH IS AN 
UNBELIEVABLE FEAT FOR NATIONAL HUNT 
RACING AND HE IS NOW TALKING TO 
RISHI PASS YAD PAUL CAN WE GET 
YOUR REACTION TO THAT DEFEAT I I THINK RUBY FELT HE SHOULD HAVE GOT 
A LEAD AND NOT BEEN SO POSITIVE AND 
HE ROLLED ABOUT A BIT IN FRONT AND 
I SAID LOOK WE GET IT RIGHT MORE 
TIMES THAN WE GET IT WRONG SO I'LL 
TAKE THE BLAME 
WERE YOU WORRIED 
ABOUT GETTING INTO BATTLE WITH OUR 
VIC 
NO I JUST SAID QOGTS RIDE VIC HIM LIKE YOU LIKE TO AND IF YOU 
WANT TO ROLL ON ROLL ON BUT HE 
DIDN'T AGREE WITH ME ON THE DAY 
HE'S RUN A CRACKING GOOD RACE AND 
THE BEST HORSE ON THE DAY WON WHAT WHAT ABOUT KAUTO STAR'S JUMPING TODAY 
HE MADE FEW MISTAKES COME TO THE 
LAST DITCH AND HE MISSED THAT OUT 
YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST HIM AND WE'LL 
GET HIM BACK AND GET HIM FRESH 
AGAIN 
WE'RE JUST LOOK AT THE AGAIN MISTAKE HE MADE AT THE SECOND TO 
LAST THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THE ONE 
HE MADE AT KEMPTON IN THE KING 
GEORGE I 
THAT DIDN'T HELP BUT IT 
WAS AN EXTRA FURLONG TODAY AND 
RUBY SAID COMING IN WE GOT IT WRONG 
HE'S MAD WITH ME BUT WE NORMALLY 
GET IT RIGHT 
ONE THING ABOUT KAUTO 
STAR EVEN IN DEFEAT HE SEEMS TO 
SHOW SO MUCH COURAGE AND 
DETERMINATION 
EXACTLY HE DON'T DETERMINATION WIN TOP CLASSES LIKE HE DOES 
WITHOUT COURAGE O. K. I GOT THE 
TACTICS WRONG TODAY BUT THERE WILL 
BE ANOTHER DAY AND HE'LL BE BACK 
NEXT SEASON DON'T YOU WORRY I'M I'M SURE YOU'RE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT 
THIS BUT YOU HAVE CROSSED THE THREE 
MILLION BARRIER 
WELL THAT'S NICE 
BUT WE WANT TO BE WINNING GOOD GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE YOU GET ONE IN THE 
BAG 
THANKS VERY MUCH 
WELL YOU'LL BAG GO A LONG WAY TO SEE BETTER RACE 
THAN THAT ONE 
THERE HAS BEEN SHAKE UP IN THE 
GOLD CUP BETTING AND IF YOU DANCEY 
DENMAN HE'S EVENS BUT KAUTO STAR 
IS SEVEN TO ONE FOR NEXT YEAR'S GOLD CUP WE 
CAN REFLECT ON THIS NOW WITH ANDREW 
WILLIAMS AND RICHARD THORNTON AND 
PAUL NICHOLLS TOOK THE BLAME 
BECAUSE HE WENT TO THE FRONT TOO 
SOON 
YES FAIR PLAY TO PAUL SOON NICHOLLS BECAUSE THIS ISN'T RUBY'S 
WAY OF RIDING HE LIKES TO SNEAK TO 
THE FRONT AT THE LAST BUT THIS IS 
A LONG WAY OUT AND THE GROUND IS 
TIRING TODAY LATER CLEAR WAS 
SAYING THIS MISTAKE STOPPED HIM 
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE HE JUST 
STEPPED ON TOP OF IT IT DIDN'T 
HELP HIS CAUSE BUT DIDN'T TOTALLY 
STOP HIM BUT FULL CREDIT TO OUR 
VIC 
AND YOU CAN SEE HE IS EMPTY IN VIC THE TANK BECAUSE HE'S HANGING UP 
AND DOWN ON THE ONE SPOT 
YES IT'S 
A LONG WAY OUT FROM THE LAST TO THE 
END BUT HE DOES PRICK HIS EARS 
GOING TO THE LAST MEASURES THE 
FENCE AND DOES NOTHING WRONG WITH 
IT SO THERE WAS STILL A LITTLE 
LEFT IN THE TANK BUT WITH TIMMY 
COMING WIDER OF HIM IT JUST TOOK A 
LITTLE BIT MORE 
A HORRIBLE 
POSITION TO BE IN WHEN YOU'RE GOING 
UP AND DOWN ON THE SPOT 
YES BUT 
FULL MARKS TO TIMMY HE GOT IT 
RIGHT AT CHELTENHAM AND AGAIN TODAY 
AND WELL DONE FOR PAUL NICHOLLS 
ADMITTING DEFEAT 
AND OUR VIC GOT 
AN EEGSY LEAD FIRST OF ALL AND 
THEN TAKEN ON FOR IT AND THEN TOOK 
IT BACK EASY 
YES YOU WON'T SEE 
ANOTHER RACE LIKE THIS A SAD DAY 
FOR ROUBY WELSH BUT AS HE WILL SAY 
HIMSELF IT'S ONLY A HORSE RACE 
AND JUST LOOK UNDER HIS CHIN YOU 
CAN SEE SOME STOCKING SHOWING AND 
THAT TIES THE TONGUE TO THE JAW AND 
THEY CAN BREATHE 
LET'S LOOK A BIT FURTHER BACK THEY 
WERE CAT AND MOUSE AT THIS STAGE 
YES KAUTO STAR GOT TIGHT IN TO 
THAT ONE AND PECKED A LITTLE ON 
LANDING I THOUGHT EXOTIC DANCER 
WAS GOING TO GET INTO LITTLE AT 
THAT STAGE BUT IT WAS A SUPER 
HORSE RACE

RESPONSIBLE FOR BINOCULAR IN THE 
NEXT NEXT WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT BIN LADEN 
GOT BEATEN BY CAPTAIN C. B.

HE CHANGES HIS MIND MANY TIMES IN 
THE HALF HOUR BEFORE THE RACE ON 
THE DAY AND WE LEFT IT WITH HIS 
CALL 
THIS BRINGS TOGETHER THE CALL SUPREME NOVICE HURDLE FROM 
CHELTENHAM AND DID YOU HAVE YOUR 
OWN OPINION OF WHO IS IN STRONGEST

CAN GO ONE BETTER TODAY L. THINK 
THEY'RE BOTH VERY GOOD HORSES AND 
HOPEFULLY WE HAVE THE BETTER ONE A A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD TAKE YOUR 
ADVICE ON BETTING OUT THERE WOULD 
YOU ADVISE PEOPLE TO HAVE A BET ON 
BINOCULAR AT CURRENT KNOCKS I I WOULDN'T STOP THEM CELESTIAL HALO 
IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF BEATING 
BUT WE'RE IN GOOD FORM THE HORSE 
LOOKS GOOD AND HE LOOKS AS IF HE 
CAME OUT WELL FROM CHELTENHAM AND 
WE'RE IN FOR A GOOD SHOW 
GOOD LUCK 
THATCH THATCH A VERY PLEASED MAN ALONGSIDE ME 
RICHARD DUNWOODY WHO PICKED OUR VIC 
YES NOW CELESTIAL HALO HAS COME 
OUT OF HIS RACE WELL AND LOOKING ON 
HIS TOES BUT THE ONE I LIKE IS 
BINOCULAR A TYPICAL NICKY 
HENDERSON HORSE AND HE MUST BE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO HIS RIGHT ON HIM 
AND THIS MAN HAS ONLY BEEN IN THIS 
PARADE RING ONCE WITH SKAL SAP 
SILVER BIRCH YES ONLY ONCE AS A 
RIDER BUT COUPLE OF TIMES AS A TRAINER TRAINER AND HARPER VALLEY DID WELL AT 
DUNDALK 
YES HE WAS ON TOP FORM DUNDALK THEN BUT WHETHER HE WINS OR NOT 
HE'LL BE RIGHT ON THEIR HEELS TO 
THE LAST HE WENT TO MUSCLE BOROUGH 
AND CAME HOME WITH A COUPLE OF 
MUSCLES PULLED BUT HE'S BOUNCED 
BACK AND WE'RE EXPECTING A BIG RUN 
TODAY 
GOOD LUCK 
THANK YOU BACK TODAY BACK HERE IN THE STUDIO WE'RE SING 
TINGLING OVER THIS IT LOOKS LIKE A 
TWO HORSE RACE AND BIN LADEN'S TIME 
AT CHELTENHAM WAS VERY VERY FAST 
YES IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT HE ONE 
QUICKER THAN THE CHAMPION HURDLEER 
AND HE WAS ONLY JUST BEATEN BY 
CAPTAIN C. B. E. ON THAT DAY CAPTAIN 
C. B. C. B. AND LUPANAR BEAT BINOCULAR IN THE 
TRIUMPH HURDLE BUT NOW HE IS AT 
HIS OWN LEVEL 
YES AND BIN LADEN 
RECEIVED WEIGHT OFF HIS OLDER 
HORSES I'M SURE YOU'LL SEE RUBY 
RIDE A SIMILAR RACE TO CHELTENHAM 
POPPING HIM OUT AND MAKING PLENTY 
OF USE OF HIM HE WAS A MIDDLE 
DISTANCE ON THE FLAT A REALLY 
REALLY STAYER AND HE'LL TRY AND DO 
HIS BEST TO DRAW OUT THE STING OF 
BINOCULAR AT THE FINISH 
AND AGAIN 
HIS TONGUE TIED DOWN AND THERE ARE 
SEVERAL OTHERS WITH A BIT OF A 
CHANCE THERE IS FIRST BUDDY IN 
THE YELLOW WITH THE STRIPED SLEEVES 
BILL NORMALLY HAS FLAT RUNNERS NOT 
TOO MANY JUMPERS 
THAT'S RIGHT BUT 
INTERESTINGLY THIS HORSE RAN ON THE 
FLAT AT DONCASTER EARLIER IN THE 
SECOND AND FINISHED SECOND IN A SEVENTEEN 
RUNNER HANDICAP THAT DAY AN 
UNUSUAL WAY TO PREPARE A HORSE FOR 
A BIG FESTIVAL LIKE THIS BUT AN 
EASY WINNER AT BANGOR AND HE HAS A 
CHANCE OF FILLING THE FRAME ONLY ONLY ONE FILLY IN THE RACE THAT'S PAGAN 
STARPRINCESS STARPRINCESS BARRY KENIRY ON BOARD WHO RIDES 
KILLARNEY ON THE BIG DAY ON 
SATURDAY SATURDAY LET'S LOOK AT THE BETTING

THIS WILL BE FAST AND FURIOUS 
DAVID PIPE HAS STAR OF ANGELS IN 
THIS TOM SCUDAMORE ON BOARD 
HE IS IN BLUE WITH THE PINK 
CHEVRONS BUT IT LOOKS A TWO HORSE 
RACE ON PAPER WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING 
LIKE LUPANAR OF GARY MOOR WITH 
MATTIE BATCHELOR ON BOARD

IS RATED IN THE HIGH SEVENTIES ON THE 
FLAT AND WON LAST TIME OUT BUT

BE GETTING IN EACH OTHER'S WAY TOO 
MUCH AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT

BINOCULAR YOU COULD SEE HOW 
CONFIDENT TONY MCCOY HAD BEEN 
RIDING THROUGHOUT SEVEN LENGTHS 
AND THIRTEEN WERE THE DISTANCES MCCOY 
WHO WILL BE WEARING THESE COLOURS 
IN THE NATIONAL THERE IS NICKY 
NICKY HENDERSON OH HE CAN SEE 
THIS ONE IS GOING TO GO IN YEAH 
YEAH HE'S HAPPY ABOUT THAT HE'S 
MORE RELIEVED TRAINER AS HE SPEAKS 
TO RISHI 
THAT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE 
I THINK HE IS A CLASSY PERFORMANCE HORSE HE'S DONE YOU KNOW VERY 
LITTLE WRONG HOW GOOD IS THAT 
HORSE THAT BEAT HIM AT CHELTENHAM 
IN FAIRNESS I THINK A. P. THAT WAS 
HIS FIRST RIDE ON HIM THAT DAY IT 
MAKES THE WINNER LOOK A VERY GOOD 
HORSE I HAVE TO TAKE HIM ON 
TOMORROW DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING 
TO BEAT THAT RIDDEN LIKE THAT 
HE'S GOT THE PACE HE'S GOT THE 
TURN OF FOOT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A 
VERY GOOD JUMPER MICK SORT OF 
LOOKED AFTER HIM A BIT IN A. P.'S 
ABSENCE AND YOU KNOW HE'S ALWAYS 
LOOKED WE VERY NEARLY DIDN'T GO 
TO CHELTENHAM AT ALL BECAUSE WE 
THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE THE BETTER 
PLACE FOR HIM WITH THAT SORT OF 
NATURAL SPEED THAT HE'S GOT HE'S 
ALWAYS BEEN A TERRIBLY GOOD JUMPER 
HE WAS VERY SLICK TODAY L. L. DON'T 
THINK IT IS THAT CHELTENHAM DOESN'T 
SUIT HIM YOU PROBABLY HANG ON TO 
HIM A LITTLE BIT LONGER IN 
CHELTENHAM ANOTHER DAY I HOPE 
THERE WILL BE ANOTHER DAY 
THE WAY 
HE'S WON SEEMS THAT YOU THINK HE'S 
VERY VERY SPECIAL 
HE'S A GOOD 
FOUR YEAR OLD WE ALL KNOW THE NEXT 
STEP IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT IT IS 
NICE TO GET ONE IT IS LIKE PUNJABI 
HE WAS RUNNING IN ALL THREE GRADE 
ONES LAST YEAR L. DON'T KNOW WHAT WE 
WILL DO WITH THIS PROBABLY HOLIDAY 
TIME HE'S DONE TERRIBLY WELL ALL 
THROUGH THE WINTER AND HE'S LOVED 
JUMPING ALL THROUGH THE WINTER HE 
GOES IN SOFT GROUND HE GOES ON 
GOOD GROUND L. HOPE HE'S GOT A 
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT 
OF CLASS 
WELL DONE 
NOT THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD OF 
RIDES HE WAS VERY KEEN EARLY ON 
FOR A. P. THEN WAS ABSOLUTELY 
CRUISING AS THEY CAME INTO THE 
STRAIGHT YOU WERE SO USED TO 
SEEING HIM GO OUT AND MAKE THE 
RUNNING BUT YOU CAN ADMIRE THE 
SKILL WITH WHICH HE CAN RIDE THE 
WAITING RACE 
DEFINITELY CLARE 
HE'S RIDDEN A VERY TIDY RACE THERE 
HE'S HAD A BIT OF A QUIET RUN SINCE 
CHELTENHAM SO A. P. IT'S BROUGHT A 
HALF SMILE BACK TO HIS FACE 
HE IS 
A HARD MAN TO PLEASE 
HE IS THE 
HORSE WAS KEEN EARLY ON IT WAS 
IMPORTANT HE GOT HIM SWITCHED OFF 
AND SETTLED AND HE JUMPED 
BEAUTIFULLY FOR HIM A. P.'S RIDDEN A 
VERY TIDY PATIENT RACE 
YOU WERE 
TALKING TO ME ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT 
IT IS TO COME BACK FROM AN INJURY 
THAT YOU ARE NOT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT YOU CAN'T BE 
UNTIL YOU HAVE RIDDEN IN A FEW 
RACES 
YOU CAN'T BE A. P. HAS WORKED RACES AS HARD AS ANYONE ON HIS FITNESS L. 
CAME BECAME AFTER I HAD AN INJURY 
BUT I WAS NOT ON TOP OF IT HE WILL 
KEEP IMPROVING OVER THE NEXT THREE 
OR FOUR WEEKS AS HE SAYS HE HAS 
B. T. GOT BEATEN ON ANYTHING HE SHOULD 
HAVE WON HASN'T GOT BEATEN ON 
ANYTHING HE SHOULD HAVE WON 
IT WAS 
A VERY IMPRESSIVE RIDE ON BINOCULAR 
A. P. WILL BE RIDING ON BUTLER'S CABIN 
IN THE GRAND NATIONAL ON SATURDAY BINOCULAR IS A RECRUIT FROM FRANCE 
AND HE WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE WHEN HE 
WON AT ASCOT PROBABLY NOT QUITE SO 
THE NEXT TIME HE CAME UP AGAINST 
CAPTAIN CEEBEE IS THE FINISH 
VERY VERY CONFIDENT MCCOY HE IS 
LOOKING OVER HIS LEFT SHOULDER 
THERE JUST LOOKING ON THE BIG 
SCREEN HOW FAR HE IS AHEAD RUBY IN 
SECOND PLACE IT'S A PLOY THE 
MODERN DAY JOCKEYS ADOPT ON QUITE 
FEW OCCASIONS LOOKING OVER AT THAT 
BIG SCREEN LET'S CHECK THE FULL 
RESULT NOW WITH JOHN 
THE WINNER WAS BINOCULAR THE ELEVEN TO EIGHT 
FAVOURITE THE WEIGHT OF MONEY WAS 
CORRECT THIS MORNING THERE'S BEEN 
A BIG A SHAKE UP IN THE CHAMPION 
HURDLE FOR NEXT YEAR I'M STANDING BEHIND BINOCULAR 
WAITING FOR TONY MCCOY TO WALK PAST 
HE IS JUST CHATTING TO NICKY 
HENDERSON AT THE MOMENT I'M 
CONCERNED THAT BINOCULAR'S HIND 
LEGS ARE TOO CLOSE TO ME THEIR 
DEBRIEF IS STILL CONTINUING RUBY 
WALSH I ASKED HIM I SAID ARE 
THERE ANY EXCUSES ABOUT THE 
PERFORMANCE OF RUBY WALSH HE SAID 
THAT WAS AS GOOD AS HE WAS L. THINK 
IT'S TONY'S FIRST WINNER THIS WEEK 
WE WILL FOLLOW HIM THERE WE GO 
MAKE SURE HE'S GOT TO CLOCK IN AT 
ELEVEN STONE ELEVEN STONE AND HALF A POUND 
I CAN SEE SO THAT INFORMATION 
TRANSFERRED BACK TO THE WEIGHING 
ROOM CHATTING TO RICHARD DUNWOODY 
WELL DONE L. KNOW NO RIDE IS VERY 
EASY BUT THAT LOOKED 
STRAIGHTFORWARD 
HE TRAVELLED WELL STRAIGHTFORWARD IN CHELTENHAM AS WELL HE'S GOT 
PLENTY OF PACE AND OBVIOUSLY THIS 
TRACK WAS GOING TO HELP HIM THE 
PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY I RODE THE WRONG 
ONE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I GOT 
INJURED AND I HADN'T RIDDEN ANY OF 
THEM SO I DIDN'T KNOW L. WAS PRETTY 
HAPPY AFTER CHELTENHAM THAT THIS 
LAD WAS GOING TO A FOUR YEAR OLD 
HURDLE I WAS HAPPY TO COME ON AND 
TAKE ON CELESTIAL HALO L. WAS HAPPY 
THAT YOU KNOW IF I WAS GOING TO 
PICK ONE BETWEEN HIMSELF I WOULD 
HAVE PROBABLY PICKED THIS ONE IT'S IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED YOU LEARNT QUITE A 
BIT RIDING BINOCULAR AT CHELTENHAM 
THE PROBLEM I HAD AT CHELTENHAM WAS 
THERE WAS LOT OF HORSES IN 
CONTENTION THAT WERE FANCIED COMING 
DOWN TO THE HILL WENT TO JOIN 
RUBY AND THE OTHER ONES AT THE 
SECOND LAST CAPTAIN CEE BEE WASN'T 
TRAVELLING I TAGGED ALONG WITH THE 
FANCIED ONES IF ANYTHING IF I WAS 
RIDING THE RACE AGAIN IF YOU KNEW 
THAT CAPTAIN CEE BEE WAS GOING TO 
COME YOU WOULD TAKE THE CHANCE AND 
FOLLOW HIM 
WELL DONE A QUICK WORD 
ABOUT BUTLER'S CABIN HAVE YOU SAT 
ON HIM 
I RODE HIM LAST WEEK WAS 
HAPPY WITH HIM HE JUMPED OVER SOME 
NATIONAL TYPE FENCES J. P. HAS A FEW 
RUNNERS IN THE RACE L'AMI IS A BIT 
LOWER IN THE WEIGHTS HE'S THE ONE 
I WANT TO RIDE ONE THAT MIGHT WIN 
THE GRAND NATIONAL AND BUTLER'S 
CABIN MAYBE HAS A BETTER CHANCE HE 
DESERVES TO HAVE ME RIDE HIM I 
THINK 
WELL DONE THINK SEVERAL POINTS TO TAKE OUT OF THIS 
YOU WERE SLIGHTLY WORRIED EARLY ON 
NORMAN BECAUSE BINOCULAR WAS 
PULLING VERY HARD AND YOU WERE 
WONDERING WHETHER HE WOULD PULL 
HIMSELF INTO THE GROUND 
YES I 
SAID IT SHOWS HOW GOOD A HORSE HE 
IS HE WAS KEEN ALL THE WAY AND 
MICK FITZGERALD HAS BEEN SCHOOLING 
HIM ALL THE WINTER THIS IS IN THE 
STRAIGHT 
YOU CAN SEE THAT HE MOVED STRAIGHT UP INCREDIBLY EASILY JUST CHECKING 
ON CELESTIAL HALO BUT A. P. ALWAYS 
KNEW THAT HE HAD THE MEASURE OF THE 
HORSE IN FRONT OF HIM 
RUBY WANTED 
TO TURN IT INTO A TEST TONY IS 
TAKING A LEAD HARPER VALLEY RAN A 
CRACKING RACE HERE TONY SAYS I 
BETTER TAKE IT UP AS SLICK AS YOU 
LIKE OVER THE LAST ANDREW VERY 
IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE KATCHIT WON 
THE RACE LAST YEAR 
THE WAY A. P. WAS 
SMILING WHEN HE WAS WALKING IN 
THERE IT IS LIKE ANY JOCKEY YOU 
KNOW YOURSELF ALL HE WAS THINKING 
OF WAS NEXT YEAR HE IS THINKING 
CHAMPION HURDLE 
INTERESTING LOOK 
AT MCCOY LOOKING ACROSS AT THE BIG 
SCREEN WHERE ARE THE OTHERS HOW 
COOL IS THAT 
COOL AS YOU LIKE A 
BEAUTIFUL HORSE AND A GOOD LOOKING 
HORSE 
WELL NEXT YEAR J. P. MCMANUS HORSE THE OWNER OF THIS ONE COULD HAVE 
CAPTAIN CEE BEE AND THIS HORSE 
FIRST AND SECOND IN THE CHAMPION 
HURDLE HURDLE YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD A. P. TALKING 
ABOUT BINOCULAR HE SAYS HE IS A 
VERY GOOD HORSE GOT A REAL TURN OF 
FOOT RICHARD WAS COMPARING HIM TO 
MORELY STREET HAD THAT AMAZING 
ACCELERATION AFTER THE LAST DAN 
WALKER IS PART OF OUR TEAM OVER 
THESE THREE DAYS AND HE HAS BEEN 
TAKING A LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES AT AINTREE MOST OF THE ATTENTION IS

COULD GET HIS FIRST WINNER IN THE 
GRAND NATIONAL A VERY EASY WINNER 
THERE ON BINOCULAR OVER THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF DAYS

I DON'T THINK IT IS REAL CORBIERE IT IS AMAZING 
HER LOVE OF HORSES 
AND EMOTIONAL OUTPOURINGS PASTED 
INTO FOLKLORE NONE MORE SO WHEN 
AINTREE WAS EVACUATED BEFORE THE 
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN NATIONAL AFTER A BOMB SCARE 
IF YOU COULD HAVE SEEN THE SCENES 
DOWN AT THE STABLE YARD WHERE WE 
HAVE HAD TO LEAVE OUR HORSES SHE SHE WILL ALSO BE REMEMBERED AS THE 
TRAINER OF THE NINETEEN NINETY THREE RACE WHICH WAS 
LATER ABANDONED BECAUSE OF A FALSE 
START TWO YEARS LATER SHE WON HER 
SECOND NATIONAL ROYAL ATHLETE 
MAKING IT A SECOND VICTORY FOR THE 
TRAINER 
ROYAL ATHLETE COMES TO THE TRAINER LINE TO WIN 
WITH HER ACHIEVEMENTS 
IN THE GRAND NATIONAL SHE CAN 
RIGHTFULLY CLAIM TO BE THE QUEEN OF 
AINTREE FEW PEOPLE CAN CLAIM TO KNOW MORE 
ABOUT THIS COURSE THESE FENCES AND

GOT THE MAGIC 
YOU KNOW MOST ABOUT 
THESE HORSES BECAUSE YOU COULD RIDE 
FIVE OR SIX IN THE RACE PROBABLY PROBABLY DOWN TO RIDE FOUR OR FIVE OF THEM 
IT IS A GOOD RACE ALVINO HAS A LOT 
OF ABILITY SCOTS GREY WON IT WELL 
LAST YEAR HE WILL TAKE ALL THE 
BEATING AND BUCKBY LANE HAS GOT

KATARINO SAM WALEY COHEN HAS HAD 
SOME CRACKING RIDES AROUND HERE L. 
THOUGHT KATARINO LOOKED VERY WELL

OF FLESH HE HASN'T RUN FOR THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO 
DAYS 
ALSO HE IS A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD HE DAYS WAS GOING AROUND IN MY DAY 
CERTAINLY HE'S GOT AGE AGAINST HIM

ELEVEN AND TWELVE SCOTS GREY ANOTHER OLD 
TIMER 
KATARINO HAS WON IT TWICE TIMER THIS FELLA WON IT LAST YEAR WILL 
BE GOING TO TRAIN ON HIS OWN IN 
SOMERSET SOON JAMIE SNOWDEN 
DICKIE HAD A FANTASTIC RIDE ON THIS 
HORSE I WAS STOOD AT THE CHAIR 
LAST YEAR JUMPED FROM FENCE TO 
FENCE WAS HEADED BETWEEN THE LAST 
TWO AND THEN BATTLED REALLY GAMELY 
BACK UP THE RUN IN IT WAS 
FANTASTIC RACE TO WATCH 
THE WINNER 
THE GREY WAS BRED BY WILLIE CARSON

BRED THEM TO GO ON THE FLAT WELL

NINA CARBERRY IS IN THE YELLOW HAT 
IF WE GO TO THE RIGHT WE WILL 
CATCH NINA WE ARE LOOKING AT 
ARCTIC TIMES WE DO HAVE HANNAH 
WATSON HAS COME OFF AND SHE'S 
REMOUNTED AND THAT IS ON VISCOUNT 
BANKES HE'S GOT A BIT TO FIND ON 
HIS PREVIOUS FORM BUT ALSO LOOK 
HEAD HIGH SWEATING OOH YOU WOULD 
BE WORRIED 
MIGHT NOT BE THE SORT 
OF HORSE I WOULD WANT TO LINE UP IN 
THIS RACE 
IF WE CAN FIND NINA 
CARBERRY SHE IS ON THE EIGHTEEN HORSE 
THE YELLOW CAP THERE SHE IS IN 
THE MIDDLE THIS HORSE WAS THIRD IN 
THE RACE LAST YEAR NINA CARBERRY 
THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT SHE'S BEEN 
PAID BY J. P. MCMANUS'S TRAINER IS 
THAT SHE'S ONLY A POUND BEHIND THE 
BEST OF THE MEN 
THIS IS IT SHE IS 
A GREAT HORSEWOMAN REALLY YOU 
HAVE SEEN HER GO AROUND THE CROSS 
COUNTRY COURSE AND IT SHOWS HOW 
GOOD SHE IS 
LET'S SEE THE MARKET 
THE FAVOURITE STILL REMAINS 
THISTHATANDTOTHER FROM THE PAUL 
NICHOLLS' YARD THERE HAS BEEN 
SERIOUS MONEY FOR CHRISTY BEAMISH ONE HORSE BEING BACKED FROM FIFTIES 
INTO THIRTY THREES IS HOLY JOE 
OTHER THAN THE SHEER SPECTACLE OF 
THIS RACE THE OTHER INTERESTING 
THING NORMAN IS GOING TO BE THE NEW 
STARTING SYSTEM THEY ARE GOING TO 
TRY AND GUILT THEM LINE UP BEHIND 
THE STARTING TAPE 
THAT IS A GREAT 
SHOT 
AND GET THEM TO LINE UP SHOT BEHIND THE STARTING TAPE THEY THEY WON'T GET TO THE TAPE SO WE HAVE 
SEEN IT BEFORE HORSES GETTING 
THEIR HEADS OVER THE TAPE IT IS 
ALSO AT A FORTY FIVE DEGREE ANGLE WHEN IT 
GOES UP IT GOES AWAY FROM THE 
HORSES THIS IS A NEW THING THEY 
HAVE TRIED IT ONCE BEFORE TO KEEP 
THE HORSES BACK FROM THE START THE 
ACTUAL STARTER IS BACK FROM THE 
STARTING TAPE THIS YEAR LET'S HOPE 
IT WORKS WELL HERE IS ANOTHER ONE WITH A DEFINITE 
CHANCE CHRISTY BEAMISH A SIX TO ONE SHOT 
JOSH GUERRIERO RIDING THIS ONE 
FINISHED SECOND TO KATARINO LAST 
TIME ALTHOUGH HE HAD FALL TWO 
RUNS AGO HE HAS WON SINCE THEN HE HE HAS CLARE HE HAS A CHANCE HE 
LOOKS WELL IN THE PADDOCK HE IS A 
FINE BIG HORSE YOU WOULDN'T MIND 
RIDING HIM OVER THESE FENCES

THINK AT EIGHT TO ONE HE IS AN OUTSTANDING 
CHANCE 
THERE SHE IS SHE'S RIDING CHANCE A BIT LONGER THAN SHE NORMALLY DOES 
SURVIVAL IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY 
HERE THIS HORSE ALVINO HAS A 
CHANCE RICHARD BURTON LAST YEAR'S 
WINNING JOCKEY HE WON IT ON SCOTS 
GREY AND THIS YEAR HE'S SWITCHED TO

RISHI WITH THE WINNER YOUR BEST 
MOMENT EVER 
I THINK SO IT HAS TO 
BE AMAZING 
TELL US ABOUT IT FROM 
THE ELBOW TO THE HOME STRAIGHT AND 
THE BATTLE WITH KATARINO 
WELL HE 
HAS JUMPED THE LAST BRILLIANT L. 
THOUGHT KATARINO MIGHT DO IT TOOR A 
BY THE BUT THIS HORSE HAS GUTS AND 
IT OUTBATTLED HIM 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
RUNNING 
MADE A HORRIFIC MISTAKE AT RUNNING BEECHERS I DON'T KNOW HOW HE 
RECOVERED 
A TREMENDOUS SEASON RECOVERED WHAT A WAY TO CAP IT 
I DON'T KNOW 
HOW TO CAP IT 
JOSH SAYING HE 
SURVIVED A TERRIBLE MISTAKE CAME 
TO THE LAST BACK IN CONTENTION 
KATARINO GAVE SAM A WONDERFUL RIDE 
GOT INTO A LOVELY RHYTHM BUT HASN'T 
RUN FOR A LONG TIME THE ONLY TIME 
IT SHOWED WAS IN THE LONG RUN FROM 
THE LAST TO THE LINE HE PUT UP AL 
MARVELLOUS PERFORMANCE THE SECOND 
HORSE THIRTEEN BUT HE HAS BEEN DONE 
JUST IN THIS LONG RUN FROM THE LAST 
TO THE LINE YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS 
LIKE 
IT IS A VERY VERY LONG RUN LIKE I THOUGHT SAM IN THE RAIL THERE 
MIGHT JUST HELP HIM TO GET KATARINO 
BACK UP BUT CHRISTY BEAMISH JUST A 
COUPLE OF YEARS YOUNGER KATARINO 
THIRTEEN IT HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
IN NOT HAVING A RUN 
DON'T YOU 
THINK THAT AMATEUR RIDERS GENERALLY 
HAVE REALLY IMPROVED IN THEIR 
TECHNIQUE AND STYLE THEY LOOK LIKE 
PROS 
I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY PROS FROM MARCUS ARMITAGE BUT THE DAY OF 
THE EARLY NINETIES HOW MUCH THE ARM 
TOURS HAVE COME ON AND WATCHING SAM 
RIDEK OVER THE FENCES GIVING 
KATARINO A SPLENDID RIDE 
BUT THE 
MOMENT BELONGS TO THIS MAN JOSH 
GUERRIERO A WONDERFUL MOMENT FOR 
HIM AND FOR CHRISTY BEAMISH

THESE YOUNG RIDERS SOME OF THEM GO 
THE PONY RACING ROUTE IN THE POINT 
TO POINTS AND THEN INTO RACING 
UNDER RULES AS AN AMATEUR AND THEN 
SOME OF THEM TURN PROFESSIONAL IT

FANTASTIC TRAINING PERFORMANCE TO 
BRING HIM BACK TODAY HE WAS A 
LITTLE BIT SHORT IN HIS ACTION

START FOR THE PUNTERS INITIALLY L. 
THINK THE BOOKIES ARE AHEAD BUT A 
LONG WAY TO GO 
THE GRAND NATIONAL 
WE ALL WANT TO KNOW CLOUDY LANE 
WHAT PRICE WILL IT START 
A LOT OF 
PEOPLE SAYING HE COULD START THE 
SHORTEST PRICE FAVOURITE SINCE RED 
RUM SEVEN TO TWO L. THINK IT IS POSSIBLE 
THE PROFESSIONAL AND PUBLIC WILL 
COME FOR IT MY FEELING IS THAT IT 
IS A COMPETITIVE RACE I WOULD SAY 
FOUR TO ONE NINE TO TWO MAYBE THE CURRENT PRICE 
OF FIVE IS MORE LIKELY 
YOU HAVE HAD 
DEALINGS WITH GINGER TRYING TO NICK 
A FEW PRICES OFF YOU AT THE WEIGHTS 
LUNCH EARLIER IN THE SEASON 
NOTHING NEW THERE IT WAS A HORSE 
THAT INTERESTED ME TYPICAL GINGER 
A GOOD CHANCE HE ASKED FOR FORTY TO ONE 
NO HE COULDN'T HE WAS TWENTY TO ONE HE HAS 
SHORTENED ALL THE TIME ANY TIME 
YOU PUT UP FIVE TO ONE IT IS TAKEN WE ARE 
NINE TO TWO I THINK IT MIGHT EASE ON THE 
DAY OBVIOUSLY WHEN THE PUBLIC 
MONEY FOLLOW THE PROFESSIONAL MONEY 
IN YOU WILL GET LOTS OF HORSES 
BACKED BUT HE IS HORSE THAT TICKS 
ALL THE BOXES FOR PUNTERS AT THE 
MOMENT 
THE FORM LOOKS BULLET PROOF MOMENT THE SIMPLE THING IS IF THE 
HANDICAPER HAD HIS TIME TO REASSESS

THAT FOR A YOUNG JOCKEY YOU KNOW 
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE A BIG CROWD 
TODAY 
A BIG CROWD AND IT'S BEEN A TODAY SMASHING DAY'S RACING YET ANOTHER 
VERY VERY TALENTED YOUNG RIDER

PULL IT THROUGH INTO HIS LEFT HAND 
INTO HIS CORRECT HAND AND THE HORSE

LIKE TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN L. FELT HE 
MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE FIRST HE HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T MISS THE LAST 
LENNON ALL THE PEOPLE BASED HERE

MISTAKE AS I THOUGHT IT WAS HE HE DIDN'T DECIDE TO BE QUITE SO BRAVE 
OR INDEED DAFT AT THE OTHER FENCES 
BY THE TIME HE GOT TO THE LAST 
THAT IS PROBABLY WHY HE WAS CHECKED 
AT THE LAST 
HE'S GONE IN AND THE 
HORSE HAS LISTENED TO HIM AND HE'S 
POPPED IT REALLY NICELY VENETIA VENETIA WILLIAMS THERE ON THE RIGHT 
GETTING A FULL RUN DOWN FROM AIDEN

CONFIDENCE BOOST FOR HIM TOO ON
