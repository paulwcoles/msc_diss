HUMPHRIES AND THE LEGENDARY PHANTOM 
ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER NOW WITH THE 
FINAL JUST TWO WEEKS AWAY THINGS 
COULD GET EMOTIONAL LATER JOSEPHS 
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED NO CRYING 
ALL RIGHT NONE 
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER BUT 
IT SEEMS ALL OF OUR NANCYS THINK 
IT'S THEM 
L. BELIEVE 
I SHOULD BE THE GIRL TO 
PLAY NANCY I KNOW I HAVE GOT THE 
CONVICTION AND THE DETERMINATION 
NEEDED TO PLAY THIS ROLE 
I SHOULD 
BE NANCY 
BECAUSE I 
WANT HER 
TO 
BE 
FEISTY AND GUTSY AND SHE IS A 
WOMAN WHO HAS MATERNAL INSTINCTS I 
THINK THE PERSON I DON'T OFFER 
THAT IS 
SAM SHE'S NOT NANCY 
IN THAT 
SENSE 
I DON'T 
BELIEVE SOME 
IN THAT SENSE OF THE GIRLS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE 
NEEDED FOR THIS ROLE LIKE SAM I 
DON'T BELIEVE SHE'S 
GOT IT 
I 
I SHOULD BE 
NANCY BECAUSE 
I THINK I 
COULD BRING AN EDGEY DIFFERENT 
MODERN TWIST TO THE ROLE SOMEBODY 
WHO I THINK COULDN'T WOULD BE JODI 
THE PERSON I THINK MAYBE ISN'T 
NANCY IS JODI JUST BECAUSE I 
BELIEVE HER TO BE A STEREOTYPICAL 
NANCY AND IT'S TIME FOR SOMETHING 
NEW I'M YOUNG AND FRESH AND I 
WOULD LOVE TO REDESIGN 
FOR ME 
I 
DON'T THINK 
NIAVE HAS THE 
STAMINA FOR 
T. I 
KNOW I 
HAVE THE 
EDGINESS AND 
THE RAWNESS 
AND THE 
PASSION 
TO DO 
EIGHT SHOWS 
A WEEK 
AS 
IF IT WAS MY FIRST 
THAT REALLY WAS JESSIE'S HAIR 
ANDREW ANDREW THE NANCYS HAVE OPINIONS SO DO YOU 
THE SEMIFINAL IS LOOMING WHAT ARE 
YOUR CONCERNS AT THIS STAGE MY MY CONCERN IS I CAN'T SEE A FRONT 
RUNNER I GUESS EVERYBODY 
HAS THEIR 
OWN 
VIEW ABOUT 
NANCY IT 
IS A ROLE 
THAT COULD BE PLAYED IN SO MANY 
DIFFERENT WAYS I'M GOING TO FOR 
GIVE ME IF I GLANCE AT A NOTE OR 
TWO JODI IS THE BIG WARM HEARTED 
MAYBE THE MORE TRADITIONAL NANCY 
THAT PEOPLE SEE I CAN SEE HER IN 
THE ROLE RACHEL IS A GREAT PRO 
SHE WOULD BE SAFE HANDS FOR AN 
AUDIENCE SHE WOULD DO IT VERY WELL 
SAMANTHA HAS THIS EXTRAORDINARY 
QUALITY THAT SHE HAS GROWN THROUGH 
THE SERIES WE HAVE ALL SEEN IT ON 
THE PANEL SHE'S ONLY SEVENTEEN HAS SHE 
SHOWN VULNERABILITY YET I DON'T 
REALLY REALLY KNOW JESSIE I 
THINK HAS GOT STAR QUALITY BUT 
LAST WEEK SHE DIDN'T REALLY DO HER 
BEST I THINK WE HAVE 
TO SEE 
HOW 
SHE GOES 
TONIGHT IT 
IS ALSO A 
QUESTION OF 
WHETHER YOU SEE NANCY 
AS POSSIBLY IRISH WHICH I 
COMPLETELY DO BUT I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER OTHER PEOPLE DO NIAVE IS 
THE GREAT LOVELY PORCELAIN GIRL 
WHICH I 
SAID SHE HAS THIS 
STEEL IN 
HER I 
WORRY IF 
SHE COULD 
DO 
EIGHT SHOWS 
A WEEK BUT SHE HAS 
A WONDERFUL VOICE AND PENALTY SHE 
LOOKS GREAT SHE HAS PERSONALITY 
SHE LOOKS GREAT AND HAS A FANTASTIC 
PERSONALITY IT IS A GREAT 
EXHIBITION I CAN SEE ALL THE 
JOSEPHS

A LEADING LADY TONIGHT 
SHE WAS 
VERY NEAR A LEADING LADY JUST THEN 
YOU SANG THAT BEAUTIFULLY L. DON'T 
UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS STILL A LITTLE 
UNMOVED BY THE PERFORMANCE 
I FEEL THERE'S AN EMOTIONAL CEILING 
ON YOUR PERFORMANCE THAT YOU HAVE 
TO BREAKTHROUGH IF YOU'RE GOING TO 
TRIUMPH IN THIS COMPETITION 
LET'S GO TO JOHN 
I HAVE TO 
DISAGREE WITH BARRY I THINK THAT

ANY 
JUSTICE FOR NEXT WEEK YOU WILL BE 
IN THE SEMIFINAL DENISE L. WANT TO DENISE I WANT TO SEE NEW THE SEMI FINAL I BELIEVE 
YOU 
SHOULD BE 
THERE I 
KIND OF 
UNDERSTAND 
WHAT BARRY 
IS SAYING 
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH YOU I 
HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT PAST 
PERFORMANCE AS FEMALE WATCHING 
YOU I FEEL YOU ARE LACK 
WARMTH BEHIND 
THE EYES 
ALIENATES 
LOT OF 
FEMALES 
IN THE 
AUDIENCE SOMETHING YOU NEED TO 
WORK ON I KNOW IT CAN BE CORRECTED 
YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL 
DID YOU SEE 
WARMTH IN THAT PERFORMANCE THE THE SONG IS ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HAS 
UNDYING LOVE TO SOMEBODY AND 
SAYING GOODBYE A WONDERFUL DOLLY 
PARTON LYRIC YOU COMMUNICATED THAT 
TO ME THAT IS A HUGE PLUS THE 
ONLY THING I WOULD AGREE THAT I 
REALLY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO YOU

YOU 
HAVE TO 
WORK WITH I AGREE WITH 
THE PANELISTS ON THAT YOU MUST BE

REMAINING PLACE IN THE SEMI FINIA 
NOW THE NEXT POTENTIAL WEST END 
LEADING LADY HOPING TO PROVE SHE

YOU HAVE THE STAMINA FOR 
EIGHT SHOWS A WEEK 
YOU ARE ONE OF 
THE LEADING CONTENDERS 
LAST WEEK I 
WAS SO HAPPEN QUAY WITH MY COMMENTS 
THIS WEEK I WANT TO DO THE SAME 
HAVE CHOSEN A SONG FROM THE MUSICAL 
CALLED WICKED 
IN TOWN THIS WEEK IS 
THE ORIGINAL WICKED WITCH TO MEET 
SAM 
I HAVE CHOSEN TO SING DEFYING SAM GRAVITY WHICH IS YOUR SONG 
IT IS 
OUR SONG 
YOU DON'T THINK YOU ARE 
GOING TO MEET HER I GOT TO SING 
THAT FOR HER SHE IS SO 
INSPIRATIONAL 
IF YOU COULD START INSPIRATIONAL IN A REAL STILLNESS JUST TRY TO 
BITE OUT THE WORDS 
TO HAVE FEED 
BACK LIKE HER IS AMAZING SHE 
THINKS I'M GOOD 
GREAT 
ON SATURDAY I'M HOPE TO GO GREAT GIVE THE PERFORMANCE OF MY LIFE

EXPERIENCE INTO IT AND REMEMBER 
THIS MOMENT FOREVER 
DEFYING GRAVITY AND HOPING TO RISE 
TO THE TOP IT'S SAMANTHA SHE HAS 
CHOSEN THIS NUMBER FROM THE MUSICAL 
WICKED BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF HER 
FAVOURITE SONGS OF ALL TIME COULD 
SAMANTHA BE YOUR NANCY 
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WITHIN ME 
SOMETHING IS NOT THE SAME 
I'M THROUGH WITH PLAYING BY THE RULES 
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME 
TOO LATE FOR SECOND GUESSING 
TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP 
IT'S TIME TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS 
CLOSE MY EYES AND LEAP 
IT'S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY 
I THINK I'LL TRY DEFYING GRAVITY AND YOU CAN'T PULL ME DOWN 
I'M THROUGH ACCEPTING LIMITS COS SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE SO 
SOME THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE 
BUT TILL I TRY I'LL NEVER KNOW 
TOO LONG I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF LOSING LOVE 
I GUESS I'VE LOST 
WELL IF THAT'S LOVE 
IT COMES AT MUCH TOO HIGH A COST 
SO IF YOU CARE TO FIND ME 
LOOK TO THE WESTERN SKY 
AS SOMEONE TOLD ME LATELY 
EVERYONE DESERVES THE CHANCE TO FLY 
AND IF I'M FLYING SOLO 
AT LEAST I'M FLYING FREE 
TO THOSE WHO'D GROUND ME 
TAKE A MESSAGE BACK FROM ME 
TELL THEM HOW I AM DEFYING GRAVITY 
I'M FLYING HIGH DEFYING GRAVITY 
AND SOON I'LL MATCH THEM IN RENOWN 
AND NOBODY IN ALL OF OZ 
NO WIZARD THAT THERE IS OR WAS 
IS EVER GONNA BRING ME DOWN

ONE OF THE GREAT HITS OF BROAD YE 
AND THE WEST END AT THE MOMENT AND 
YOU TOOK UP THAT CHALLENGE AND SANG 
IT MAGNIFICENTLY 
THERE WAS LIGHT 
AND SHADE IN YOUR PERFORMANCE 
ATTITUDE WITH WARMTH RACHEL NEEDS 
TO TAKE A LEAF OUT OF YOUR BOOK AND 
LEARN HOW TO DO THAT TO COMBINE THE 
TWO TWO DID SHE RISE TO HER MUSICAL 
CHALLENGE 
ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE STAR IS 
WHAT HAPPENS OFF STAGE MAKING 
CHOICE YOU MADE THE BRILLIANT 
CHOICE SO FAR THE SONG 
FROM A 
WEST 
END SHOW THAT ABSOLUTELY TOOK YOU 
TO ANOTHER NOTCH IT WAS WONDERFUL 
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE YOU ARE NOT 
QUITE YET A SELEEN DION BECAUSE YOU 
HAVEN'T MATURED YOU ARE 
POTENTIALLY A WONDERFUL SINGER YOU 
HAVE THE OTHER ADVANTAGE IN THAT 
YOU ARE VERY SECURE OF HOW YOU MOVE 
OF THE FIVE GIRLS YOU ARE THE BEST 
MOVER

NIAMH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
O. K. I'M GOING STRAIGHT TO THE PANEL 
DENISE FEISTY ENOUGH TO BE NANCY 
AFTER SEEING THAT 
WELL IF I'M 
HONEST NO FOR ME THAT LACKED 
PUNCH TONIGHT IT WAS MORE LIKE A 
TEENAGER 
HAVING A 
TANTRUM THAN A 
WEST 
END LEADING 
LADY L. DO WORRY 
BECAUSE 
YOU LOOK SO YOUNG YOU HAVE MORE TO PROVE AND I 
HAVEN'T SEEN IT I'M QUESTIONING 
WHETHER YOU ARE MORE SUITED TO THE 
ROLE OF BET WHO IS NANCY'S BEST 
FRIEND 
FOUR PLACES IN THE FRIEND SEMIFINAL SHOULD NIAMH HAVE ONE OF 
THEM 
VOCALLY YES FOR THE FIRST THEM TIME I SAW THE YOUNGER GIRL RATHER 
THAN THE OLDER ONE I'M NOT THAT 
PERFORMANCE WOULD

THE BACK 
OF THE 
STALLS RATHER THAN 
SOME 
OF THE 
PERFORMANCES I HAD FOR 
ME TONIGHT THAT IS NOT A NANCY 
PERFORMANCE THAT WAS GRITTY I 
THOUGHT NIAMH

AIMING FOR 
THERE 
IS JUST ONE PROBLEM THAT I SEE 
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT THE STAR OF 
THIS SHOW IS NOT FAGAN NOT NANCY 
BUT OLIVER TWIST AND A GROUP SMALL 
BOYS THE 
FACT OF 
THE MATTER 
IS IT IS A MATTER OF SCALE YOU 
ARE A COMPARATIVELY SMALL PERSON

LIKE GIANTS CLUSTERING AROUND YOU 
I DO SEE THAT AS A SERIOUS 
TECHNICAL PROBLEM 
BARRY HAS A POINT 
YOU SAVED THIS GIRL TWICE THE THE PANEL ABSOLUTELY HAS A POINT I SAW 
THE PORCELAIN GIRL LIKE A BULL IN 
THE CHINA SHOP WITH THE GIRLS L. 
WORRY VERY MUCH THAT JUST NOW THAT 
YOU'RE READY TO DO EIGHT SHOWS A 
WEEK

WORRIES ME

DEVELOPED YET
