EAST END CAN CLAIM TO BE THE 
SPIRITUAL HOME OF BOXING IN ENGLAND 
OVER THE YEARS MANY OF THE BEST 
NAMES IN THE SPORT HAVE DANCED ON 
THE CANVAS AT THE YORK HALL IN 
BETHNAL GREEN IT MAY BE A LONG WAY 
FROM THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF LAS VEGAS 
BUT PERFORMING AT THE YORK HALL HAS 
BECOME A RIGHT OF PASSAGE WHAT 
BETTER PLACE TO HOST THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ABH 
FINALS IT IS ONE OF THOSE EVENTS 
WHERE YOU KEEP THE PROGRAMME AND 
KEEP A NOTE OF THE NAMES ON SHOW 
BECAUSE PREVIOUS WINNERS HAVE GONE 
ON TO BECOME LEADING LIGHTS OF 
BRITISH BOXING 
LORDS OF THE BRITISH BOXING RING 
EACH ONE OF THEM WON THE TITLE AND 
THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE PACKED TO 
THE RAFTERS FOR THESE FINALS A 
FURTHER INDICATION THAT BRITISH 
BOXING IS BOOMING AT THE MOMENT AN 
UNPRECEDENTED EIGHT BOXES WILL BE 
REPRESENTING BRITAIN IN BEIJING AND 
WE WILL BE HEARING FROM THEM BUT 
OUR MAIN FOCUS IS THE BOXERS WHO 
HAVE MADE IT TO THESE FINALS L. AM 
DELIGHTED TO SAY THAT JOINING US TO 
TALK THROUGH THE PROCEEDINGS IS THE 
W. B. A. W. B. O. AND CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPION 
OF THE WORLD DAVID HAYE 
ALSO I AM 
A GOOD DAD AND A LOVELY HUSBAND 
CAN'T I GET THAT BUILD UP I'M NOT 
THE CHAMPION 
ALL THE FOCUS IS ON 
THE OLYMPIC QUALIFIERS BUT BY NO 
MEANS ARE THE FINALS HERE A POOR 
RELATION THESE KIDS CAN FIGHT NOT NOT ONLY ARE THEY POOR RELATIONS THERE 
ARE AT LEAST FOUR MAYBE AS MANY AS 
FIVE WILL TRY TO PUSH FOR A BOX 
OFFICE IT IS DONE LATE IT IS TOO 
LATE BECAUSE THE GUYS WHO HAVE 
QUALIFIED DID IT IN CHICAGO BUT 
THERE ARE LEAST FOUR AND MAYBE AS 
MANY AS SIX I THINK THEY WILL ALL 
BE WINNERS WHO WILL SAY I AM 
BETTER THAN HIM THIS IS NOT THE 
SECOND DIVISION TONIGHT IT IS AN 
ALTERNATIVE PREMIER LEAGUE DAVID DAVID YOU COME FROM A STRONG AMATEUR 
PEDIGREE BUT YOU NEVER WON ONE OF 
THESE EXPLAIN HOW IMPORTANT THIS 
PRESTIGIOUS TITLE IS FROM A BOXER'S 
PERSPECTIVE 
WHEN YOU GET INTO PERSPECTIVE BOXING THE MAIN FOCUS IS WINNING 
THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS L. 
ENTERED A TOURNAMENT ONES L. FAILED 
IN THE SEMI FINALS AND I WAS GUTTED 
BUT THEN I PUSHED ON AND STARTED 
WORKING ON MY INTERNATIONAL GAME 
AND FOCUSED ON BEING THE BEST IN 
THE WORLD L. GOT A SILVER IN THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS OF TWO THOUSAND AND DO 
SO I WAS HAPPY WITH THAT LET'S LET'S TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE FIRST 
FINAL IT IS IN THE FIFTY FOUR KILOGRAM 
BANTAMWEIGHT DIZZIED DIVISION 
LUKE CAMPBELL IS THE REIGNING 
BANTAMWEIGHT CHAMPION AND HAD TO 
BEAT MICHAEL MAGUIRE TO GET THIS 
FAR HE IS DEFENDING HIS CROWN 
AGAINST THE NAVY'S GARY SMITH 
THE BIG TALL STRINGY 
FELLOW IS THE DEFENDING CHAMPION 
LUKE CAMPBELL WHO SURPRISED A LOT 
OF PEOPLE IN HIS FIRST SENIOR YEAR 
INTO IT AS AN AND SIX AT BY BE 
DEFENDING THE TITLE ON THIS WEIGHT 
HE IS AGAINST GARETH SMITH FROM THE 
NAVY THE INTER SERVICES 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE STOPPED THE 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARMY INTO 
THIRD ROUND HE HAD A TOUGH SEMI 
FINAL AGAINST LEWIS BROWNING FROM 
EXETER BUT 
CAMPBELL HAS BEEN 
VERY IMPRESSIVE ON THE WAY HERE 
HE HAS DEFEATED TWO INTERNATIONAL'S 
INCLUDING MICHAEL MAGUIRE AND PAUL 
EDWARDS YOU HAVE TO FANCY CAMPBELL 
ON THAT ALONE 
I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH 
ABOUT HIM AND STRAIGHT AWAY I 
LIKED HIS STYLE HE IS TALL AND 
RANGY A SOUTHPAW SO HE ADDS THAT 
LITTLE BIT MORE AWKWARDNESS TO HIM 
HE IS USING HIS AWKWARDNESS WELL 
HERE 
HE GOT GOLD MEDAL IN A RECENT HERE MOTTY NATIONS TOURNAMENT IN 
MACEDONIA THAT WAS IN NOVEMBER 
LAST YEAR MULTI NATIONAL HE 
STOPPED A COUPLE OF GOOD BOXERS 
CAMPBELL IS MOVING NICELY VERY 
TALL LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WHO COULD 
MOVE UP A COUPLE OF WEIGHT 
DIVISIONS 
GOOD FOOTWORK BY HIM 
THAT WAS GOOD 
FOR AT WORK FROM CAMPBELL THE WAY 
HE MOVED OFF THOSE ROPES TURNED 
HIS OPPONENT THIRD WORK HE 
MOVED FROM A NEGATIVE POSITION INTO 
A POSITIVE ATTACKING POSITION GOOD GOOD ORTHODOX BOXING FROM GARY SMITH 
BUT HE IS GIVING AWAY AN AWFUL LOT 
GOOD WORK ON THE COUNTER BY 
CAMPBELL THE SECOND RIGHT HAND WAS 
A PEACH CAMPBELL LOOKING VERY 
COMFORTABLE GOOD FOOD WORK ONCE 
AGAIN BY HIM FOOT WORK HE BEAT 
MICHAEL MAGUIRE SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE TO ZERO 
AGAINST SALSBURY'S PAUL EDWARDS IN 
THE SEMI FINAL 
GOOD MOVEMENT LOOK AT THAT HE 
MADE HIS OPPONENT LOOKED SILLY HE 
MOVES VERY NICELY OFF THOSE ROPES 
SUCH A TALL FALLOW FOR A FIFTY FOUR 
KILOGRAM BOXER 
GARETH SMITH FROM THE NAVY 
LISTENING AS EVER INTENTLY TO HIS 
TRAINER WHO IS GIVING HIM SOME 
PRETTY GOOD ADVICE NOT BOTHERING 
WITH THE SCHOOL STALL 
THIS IS THE SECOND ROUND OF THE FIFTY FOUR 
KILOGRAMS FINAL LUKE CAMPBELL UP 
ONE OR TWO DEFENDING CHAMPIONS IN 
REASONABLY COMMANDING FORM AGAINST 
THE SHORT A MAN FROM THE NAVY 
GARETH SMITH ALL IN BLUE SMITH SMITH CANNOT AFFORD TO LET CAMPBELL GET 
INTO A RHYTHM WHIPPING THIS LEFT 
UPPERCUT UP AS WELL AT WHAT 
CAMPBELL IS DOING IT IS A 
DANGEROUS SHOT SMITH HAS GOT TO 
KEEP HIS HEAD MOVING KEEP A HIGH 
REGARD AND TRIED TO RESTRICT THIS 
MAN'S MOVEMENT TRIED TO GET ON THE 
ROPES HE IS ALLOWING CAMPBELL IN 
HE IS COMING FORWARD IN MORE OR LESS STRAIGHT LINE SIX TO ONE NOW TO CAMPBELL 
THE YORKSHIRE DAY IDOL A UNANIMOUS 
POINTS WIN OVER JASON CUNNINGHAM 
YORKSHIRE DAY TITLE 
HE LOST TO A HOME BOXER IN CROATIA 
THIRTY TWO TO TEN SO HE HAS GOT A LOT OF 
INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE GOOD 
FIREWORK ONCE AGAIN A SWEET LEFT 
HAND ON THE COUNTER BY CAMPBELL 
FOOT WORK HE IS GETTING PICKED OFF 
RIGHT AND CENTRE LOVELY BOXING BY 
CAMPBELL 
FOR A MOMENT YOU THOUGHT CAMPBELL HE WOULD STEP INSIDE AND MIX IT UP 
HE IS CAPABLE OF DOING THAT IF HE 
HAS TO SMITH STOCKY AND STRONG 
BUT BEING OUT WORK AND MOST 
IMPORTANTLY OUTRAGED GOOD DEFENCE 
BY HIM LOVELY LUCK WORK BY 
CAMPBELL AGAIN LITTLE SLAPS WITH 
THAT SOUTHPAW RIGHT OF HIS EIGHT 
POINTS BETWEEN THEM THAT IS A 
GREAT SHOT BY CAMPBELL WHAT A 
FINISH THREE POINTS IN NEARLY AS 
MANY SECONDS 
CAMPBELL CONTINUED TO USE HIS 
HEIGHT REACH AND ABILITY TO BOX 
HIS WAY TO A COMPREHENSIVE TWENTY THREE TO ONE 
DECISION DECISION A WELL DONE YOU SEEMED TO START 
FLOWING AS THE CONTEST WORE ON L. 
GOT MY RANGE A BIT BETTER AFTER THE 
FIRST ROUND STARTED LETTING MY 
SHOTS GO 
IT WAS GOOD 
COMING IN 
YOU WERE ONE OF THE HOT FAVOURITES 
DID YOU FEEL PRESSURE 
NO YOU HAVE 
GOT TO GO IN THE RING AND NOT WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT ANYONE ELSE THINKS AS 
THE UNDERDOG LAST YEAR UP BY WON 
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER REALLY BUT IT 
WAS GOOD I ENJOYED IT I WON 
BEIJING IS TOO SOON FOR YOU BUT IS 
THIS ONE STEP CLOSER TO LONDON 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
DEFINITELY THAT IS MY AIM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE EVERY STEPPING STONE IS GOING TO 
LEAD UP TO THE LONDON OLYMPICS AND 
HOPEFULLY WIN THE GOLD MEDAL IN 
LONDON THAT IS MY DREAM 
THERE 
IS SAYING IN BOXING THAT IT IS HARD TO BE WORLD CHAMPION BUT IT IS HARDER TO STAY THERE HALAM 
PRESSED ARE YOU BY THE FACT THAT 
CAMPBELL COULD SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND 
HIS TITLE 
I AM AMAZED LAST YEAR 
HE CRUISED THIS YEAR HE HAD A 
HARD TIME L. WATCHED HIM WIN 
AGAINST MAGUIRE WHO BEAT OUR 
BANTAMWEIGHT HOPE AND HE HAS HELD 
IT TOGETHER THE SCORING IN THAT 
FINAL I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN 
SUCH A WIDE GAP BUT HE HAS BEEN 
BRILLIANT 
THE ARMED FORCES AND BRILLIANT THEY COMBINE SERVICES THEY ARE 
MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO THE 
COMBINED STRENGTH AND DEPTH OF 
BOXING I THREE FROM THE ARMY 
TRAINED BY A MAN WHO WON SIX TITLES 
LIKE IN BASKETBALL AND AMERICAN 
FOOTBALL THEY SHOULD RETIRE AND 
INVEST AFTER THAT WHEN YOU WIN 
CAMERAS MEDALS AND TOURNAMENTS YOU 
SHOULD THE ROYAL NAVY OTHER 
BIGGEST SPONSORS OF AMATEUR BOXING 
IN ENGLAND THEY SPONSORED BY A 
JUNIOR TOURNAMENT BLACK AND TAKE IT 
FROM ME IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE WILL BE 
TALKING AFTER THE OLYMPICS AND 
FOUR OF BRITAIN'S OLYMPIC 
MEDALLISTS WILL HAVE BEEN ROYAL 
NAVY JUNIOR ABH CHAMPIONS LET'S LET'S JOIN OUR NEXT FINAL 
THE LIGHTWEIGHT DIVISION HAS PROVED 
TO BE A RICH SEAM OF SUCCESS FOR 
BRITISH AMATEUR BOXING WITH THE 
OLYMPIC SILVER MEDAL OF AMIR KHAN 
TONIGHT'S SIXTY TELEGRAMS FINALISTS 
CAN GO ON TO SUCH GREATNESS 
TELEGRAMS 
GARY REAY THE MAN IN RED FROM 
DURHAM LEADING HIS OPPONENT 
MARTIN STEAD BY ONE A SINGLE POINT 
IT WAS A GREAT SHOT BY STEVE AT THE 
START OF THE ROUND IT WAS BANG ON 
THE BUTTON IT DID REGISTER IT 
DIDN'T REGISTER L. L. AM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED 
SEVEN TO FIVE REAY AMAZED GOOD LEFT HAND AMAZED AND RIGHT HAND INTO THE BODY FROM 
THE MAN IN BLUE THE JUDGES HAVE A 
LITTLE ELECTRONIC KEYPAD AND IF 
THEY FEEL THAT A BOXER HAS 
CONNECTED WITH THE CORRECT PART OF 
THE GLOVE THE KNUCKLE UP ON THE 
TARGET AREAS THE HEAD OR THE TORSO 
AND THREE OF THEM WITHIN A SECOND 
PRESS THE SAME BUTTON IT IS 
REGISTERED ON THE COMPUTER A GOOD 
SOLID RIGHT HAND INTO THE MIDDLE BY 
STEAD WHY DID THAT NOT ALL THAT 
IS DREADFUL AT LAST APOLOGIES TO 
THE ELECTRONICS AND THE JUDGES OF 
COURSE 
WE DID SEE A BIT OF THAT THE LAST 
TIME WE WERE TOGETHER IN ATHENS A 
FEW YEARS AGO THERE WERE SOME 
STINKERS 
I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED STINKERS WITH GARY REAY HE HAS BEEN MOVING 
WELL AND WAITING FOR HIS 
OPPORTUNITIES HE IS THEN LANDING 
TWOS AND THREES 
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT BY STEAD THE 
FIRST ONE WAS JUST GLANCING MAYBE 
NOT WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE IT WAS 
SLIDING BLOW A SINGLE POINT 
BETWEEN THEM YET AGAIN THE A. B. A. SIXTY 
KILOGRAMS GROUND IS STILL THERE FOR 
THE TAKING A BUSY CAUTIOUS ROUND 
THEY WORKED OUT EACH OTHER'S STYLE 
AND IT IS ALL ABOUT PUTTING 
DISTANCE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND YOUR 
OPPONENT AND SCORING AS YOU DO SO 
THAT WAS GOOD SHOT WHY DID IT 
NOT SCORE IT WAS A CORKER RIGHT 
INTO THE MIDRIFF THAT WAS THE BEST 
SHOT OF THE ROUND 
LOVELY SHOT 
LOVELY TIMING HE'S COMING ON TO YOU 
A TIGHT JAB LISTEN TO ME 
THIS MAN 
HAS GOT TO KEEP BUSY IN THIS ROUND 
STEAD CANNOT AFFORD TO RELY ON A 
SINGLE SHOT OF HE MUST THROW MORE 
PUNCHES SINGLE SHOT 
BOTH MEN 
ARE OUT OF THEIR STALLS STOOLS 
LONG BEFORE THE BELL GARY REAY 
THE SOUTHPAW 
THEY WERE BOTH PUT THEIR FOOT ON 
THE GAS THEY WILL BOTH SOME SOME GOOD SHOTS FROM STEAD LANDING WITH 
THE RIGHT HAND INTO THE BODY AND 
THEN HE SWITCHES UPSTAIRS WITH THE 
LEFT HOOK 
STEAD HAS ONLY BEEN IN 
FRONT ONES ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
REAY HAS MAINTAINED DAYLIGHT BUT 
THERE IS NOTHING BETWEEN THEM IF 
IT IS EVEN AFTER FOUR ROUNDS ALL 
FIVE JUDGES' INDIVIDUAL SCORES ARE 
LOOKED AT THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST 
ARE DISCOUNTED AND THEN THE 
CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF THE REMAINING 
THREE IT'S CALLED COUNTBACK THAT 
MAY WELL COME INTO PLAY UNLESS 
SOMEBODY CAN A SOLID PUNCH WILL 
DECIDE THIS TITLE RICHIE 
THAT WENT EARLY THAT WAS A 
NONSENSE THERE WAS ANOTHER MINUTE 
TO GO THAT'S COMPLETELY WRONG THE 
TIMEKEEPER HAS RUNG THE BELL WITH A 
MINUTE AGO DEAR OH DEAR WELL 
DONE MR. TIMEKEEPER NO SUPPER FOR 
YOU I HAVE TO SAY WHAT WAS HE 
DOING WAS USING AN EGG TIMER HOW 
FRUSTRATING IS THAT BOTH MEN 
THOUGHT IT WAS OVER NEITHER MAN 
WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS STILL LEVEL 
THIS WILL ADD A BIT EXTRA TO IT 
RICHIE BUT WHAT A NONSENSE 
A GOOD 
SHOT FROM STEAD DOWNSTAIRS ANOTHER 
ONE TO THE HEAD 
REAY HAS GONE 
AHEAD FORGIVE US THE ELECTRONIC 
CLOCK IS NOT WORKING THANKS TO THE 
TIMEKEEPER BUT WHAT MATTERS IS THE 
SCORING NINE TO NINE IT MAY WELL GO TO 
COUNTBACK A SINGLE SHOT COULD WIN 
THIS IS IT GOING TO BE THE MAN 
FROM DURHAM IS IT GOING TO BE THE 
SOLDIER STEAD LOOKING THE MORE 
COMFORTABLE MAYBE SLIGHTLY THE 
FITTER OF THE TWO THE SOUTHPAW 
REAY MAY BE LOOKING A BIT ANXIOUS 
IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE WE HAVE HAD 
TO GO TO CANNES BACK IN AN A. B. A. 
FINAL COUNTBACK 
A POINT BETWEEN THEM IT'S ALL OVER 
STEAD HAS WON IT RIGHT AT THE END 
A MOST EXTRAORDINARY ROUND STOPPED 
IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE THE BELL WENT 
TO SIGNAL THE END OF THE CONTEST 
WHEN THERE WAS A MINUTE TO GO BUT 
BACK THEY CAME AGAIN STEAD WHO 
HAD BEEN BEHIND FOR MOST OF IT DID 
JUST ENOUGH GOOD FOOTWORK BY HIM 
THAT WAS THE LEFT HAND RICHIE 
LOVELY LEFT HOOK ON THE INSIDE HE 
ALSO CATCHES REAY WITH STRAIGHT 
RIGHT HAND BANG STRAIGHT THROUGH 
THE MIDDLE THAT IS THE RIGHT AND 
THAT WILL GIVE THE ARMY OF THEIR 
SECOND A. B. A. CHAMPION OF THE EVENING 
YOU WERE IN FRONT ONLY FOR THE LAST 
TEN SECONDS IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
CLOSER 
I JUST COULD NOT GET INTO CLOSER IT IT WAS A BIT TRICKY L. KNEW I 
HAD TO WORK FOR THE LAST ROUND 
WHICH I DID TEN TO NINE YEAH 
FROM THE YEAH LAST ROUND I THOUGHT I HAD ONE 
CAUGHT HIM WITH THE MORE CLEAR 
SHOPS I HAD WON 
WARD ABOUT WHEN 
THE BELL RANG EARLY WHAT ABOUT 
I WOULD HAVE GOT BEATEN I KNEW IT 
WAS NOT TWO MINUTES LUCKILY THEY 
SORTED IT OUT 
HAS THAT HAPPENED TO 
YOU BEFORE 
NO HOPEFULLY NEVER 
AGAIN 
YOU HAVE SCRAPED THROUGH AGAIN WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU 
IT REALLY 
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME L. SHOULD 
HAVE WON ONE A FEW YEARS AGO BUT I 
WAS AT THE LONG WAIT NOW I HAVE 
STEPPED DOWN IT HAS WORKED FOR ME 
THE WRONG WEIGHT 
CONGRATULATIONS TO MARTIN STEAD 
THE NEW A. B. A. LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION 
THAT IS THE WEIGHT AT WHICH AMIR 
KHAN REPRESENTED TEAM G. B. WITH SUCH 
DISTINCTION AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN 
ATHENS FOUR YEARS AGO HE WAS THE 
ONLY BRITISH BOXER TO MAKE IT 
THROUGH THE TOUGH QUALIFICATION 
PROCESS BUT HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED 
THIS SUMMER EIGHT BOXERS FROM 
THESE SHORES WILL GO FOR MEDALS IN 
BEIJING IN FRANKIE GAVIN THERE IS 
EVEN A REIGNING WORLD AMATEUR 
CHAMPION A PHENOMENAL ACHIEVEMENT 
WHO ARE THE ELITE EIGHT 
THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TALENTED 
GROUP OF BOXERS WE HAVE DEVELOPED 
A CULTURE OF WINNING THEY KNOW 
THAT IF THEY ARE GOING TO EARN ANY 
MONEY IN THE PRO RANKS THEY HAVE 
TO GO TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND WIN 
A MEDAL

DOWNTIME WE GO OUT AND HAVE A 
DRINK WE ARE JUST NORMAL LADS NO NO ONE EXPECTED EIGHT OF US TO QUALIFY 
FOR THE OLYMPICS EVERYONE SAYS IT 
COULD BE A BIG FLUKE BY THE TIME 
IT GETS THERE EIGHT OF US WILL BE 
BRINGING MEDALS BACK 
YOU HAVE ALL 
GOT A BIT OF ATTITUDE NONE OF YOU 
WANT TO LOSE 
IT'S FRIENDSHIP WE 
ARE THAT CLOSE AS FRIENDS WHEN ONE 
OF US DOES WELL THE REST HAVE TO 
FOLLOW 
WHEN WE GET TOGETHER WE FOLLOW SIT DOWN AND HAVE A FOLLOW GOOD CHAT ABOUT 
IT AND TALK IT THROUGH WE ARE 
THERE FOR ONE ANOTHER IT'S GOOD 
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN GREAT BRITAIN 
AT A NATIONAL TOURNAMENT THEY WERE 
NOT REALLY CONSIDERED A THREAT 
THAT HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST FIVE 
THAT HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT HAS WE 
GO 
TO TOURNAMENTS YEARS AND OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T WANT TO 
GET DRAWN AGAINST US A FEW YEARS 
AGO I CAN REMEMBER ENGLAND WERE 
AN EASY DRAW WE WOULD BE LUCKY TO 
COME BACK WITH A BRONZE MEDAL NOW 
WE GO BACK AND IF WE DON'T GET ALL 
OF THE BOXERS INTO THE FINAL IT IS 
A DISAPPOINTMENT 
WE KNOW WE ARE 
ONE OF THE BEST COUNTRIES IN THE 
WORLD NOW WE CAN BEAT EVERYONE 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE TOP 
CLASS BOXERS YOU THINK THEY ARE 
GOOD BUT ONCE YOU GET IN WITH THEM 
YOU THINK THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD AS 
YOU THINK THEY ARE THEN YOU 
REALISE HOW GOOD YOU ARE THERE'S THERE'S NO ONE OUT THERE WHO IS TRAINING 
HARDER THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY 
WE ARE TRAINING AS MUCH AS WE ARE 
FIGHTING THAT IS THE EASY WORK A A LOT HAS CHANGED FOR GREAT BRITAIN'S 
AMATEUR BOXERS THERE WAS A TIME 
WHEN THEY WENT AWAY FOR JUST ONE 
NIGHT PER MONTH TO CRYSTAL PALACE 
AND THEN ONLY SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS 
PER YEAR NOW THEY SPEND FOUR DAYS 
AND NIGHTS EACH WEEK HERE AT THE 
ENGLISH INSTITUTE OF SPORT THAT 
HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT A YEAR 
IN THE ONE HUNDRED DAYS LEADING UP TO THE 
OLYMPICS THE ENTIRE TEAM OF EIGHT 
WILL BE AWAY FOR TOURNAMENTS 
SPARRING WITH CUBANS FOR OVER SEVENTY 
OF THE ONE HUNDRED DAYS THAT'S WHY THE 
GREAT BRITISH AMATEUR BOXING SYSTEM 
IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD 
WE HAVE 
NOW GOT MORE MONEY ON BOARD THAN WE 
HAVE EVER HAD BEFORE NOT ENOUGH 
BY ANY MEANS BUT A LOT MORE WE 
ARE NOW OFFERING OUR PODIUM BOXERS 
FULL TIME ATHLETES ENOUGH MONEY TO 
LIVE A REASONABLE COMFORTABLE LIFE 
IT HAS GIVEN THEM THE POTENTIAL TO 
FULFIL THE DREAM THAT THEY HAVE HAD 
WHEN THEY FIRST PUT ON A PAIR OF 
GLOVES 
THE OLYMPIC DREAM 
AT THE GLOVES OLYMPIC DREAM 
TERRY HAS PUT HIS 
FOOT DOWN AND WE HAVE GOT EVERYBODY 
WE NEED BEHIND US DIETICIANS 
WEIGHT MANAGEMENT ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH FULL TIME TRAINING THAT 
IS THE PROGRAMME WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
THAT IS WHAT HAS MADE US FULL TIME 
TOP CLASS BOXERS 
SO YOUR 
PROFESSIONALS 
YEAH SOME PEOPLE PROFESSIONALS TRAIN MORE THAN PROFESSIONALS OLD OLD FOR PROFESSIONALS SUPER SUPER PROFESSIONALS 
ULTRA PROFESSIONALS PROFESSIONALS BY THE TIME OF THE 
OLYMPICS YOU MIGHT BE HAVING YOUR 
SEVENTEENTH BOUT OF THE YEAR IS THAT A 
LOT OR IDEAL PREPARATION IDEAL IDEAL THAT IS THE WAY YOU GET BETTER IT 
IS THE WAY YOU GET TO KNOW 
OPPONENTS DEFINITELY THE RIGHT 
PREPARATION 
GOING OUT TO BEIJING PREPARATION YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE NUMBER ONE 
WHICH IS UNIQUE IN BRITISH AMATEUR 
BOXING HISTORY IT HAS NEVER 
HAPPENED IS THERE A BIT OF EXTRA 
PRESSURE ON YOU 
NO LOTS OF PEOPLE 
SAY THAT TO ME BUT I GO OUT THERE 
AND DO WHAT I DO AS LONG AS I 
PERFORM WELL I KNOW I WILL GET THE 
GOLD 
BOXING IS A UNIQUE OLYMPIC GOLD SPORT IT IS THE ONLY SPORT IN THE 
SUMMER OR THE WINTER GAMES WHERE 
WINNING A GOLD MEDAL IS AND THE 
HIGHEST AND THE GREATEST THING YOU 
CAN DO SURE IT IS HARD IT IS 
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT A FANTASTIC 
ACHIEVEMENT FOR ANY ATHLETE TO WIN 
AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL BUT UNLIKE 
ALL THE OTHER SPORTS ONCE A BOXER 
WINS A GOLD MEDAL HE'S GOT 
SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GO HE'S GOT THE 
PROFESSIONAL GAME 
FIGHTING FOR MY 
FUTURE AND MY FAMILY'S FUTURE NOT 
JUST THE GREAT BRITAIN AND MY 
COUNTRY BUT TO MAKE MY FAMILY 
PROUD OR WHATEVER YOU DO HAVE TO 
MAKE THINK ABOUT THE FINANCIAL 
ASPECTS TO HAVE THE WHOLE NATION 
BEHIND ME AND WIN A GOLD MEDAL FOR 
MY COUNTRY MAKE EVERYONE PROUD IT 
WOULD BE BRILLIANT TO INSPIRE UP 
AND COMING YOUNG BOXERS LIKE 
AUDLEY HARRISON AND AMIR KHAN TO 
DO SO THAT WOULD MEAN JUST AS MUCH 
AS FINANCIAL GAIN 
FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT TO GET EIGHT 
BOXERS THROUGH TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
HOW DO YOU RATE THE MEDAL CHANCES 
IT IS NOT JUST GETTING EIGHT BOXERS 
THROUGH IT IS AID BOXES WITH A 
GENUINE CHANCE OF A MEDAL IN THE 
LAST TWELVE MONTHS THEY HAVE BEATEN 
AND OLYMPIC MEDALLIST A EUROPEAN 
MEDALLIST A WORLD MEDALLIST THE 
WORLD NUMBER ONE OR IN THE CASE OF 
BILLIE JO SAUNDERS HE BEAT THE TOP 
CUBAN THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN YOU ARE 
SENDING AWAY A SCORED NOT JUST 
HAVING SCRAPED THROUGH 
QUALIFICATION A SQUAD THESE 
ARE THE ELITE THE GREAT EIGHT ON 
A GOOD DAY WITH A GOOD DRAW I 
CANNOT PICK ONE OF THEM WHO 
DESERVES A MEDAL MORE THAN THE 
OTHER WE COULD HAVE THREE OR FOUR 
OR EVEN FIVE MEDALS COMING BACK 
FROM BEIJING L. AM NOT GOING BUT 
THAT IS THE TRUTH PHENOMENAL PHENOMENAL PROGRESS DAVID YOU KNOW ABOUT 
PROMINENT BOXING HAVING WON A 
WORLD AMATEUR SILVER IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
TOURNAMENT BOXING HOW DIFFICULT IS 
IT NOT TO PEAK TOO EARLY FIGHT 
THROUGH INJURIES 
ONE THING THAT 
STICKS IN MY MIND IS THE PAIN THAT 
YOU GO THROUGH FOR EVERY FIGHT 
YOU'RE FIGHTING THE CHAMPION OF 
EVERY COUNTRY IT IS AGAINST A 
CHAMPION EVERY TIME SOMEONE WHO 
HAS WORKED TO GET TO WHERE HE IS 
YOU ARE GETTING KNOCKS AND BUMPS 
YOUR BACK IS SORE AND YOU HAVE TO 
FIGHT AGAIN L. HAD 
FOUR FIGHTS IN FOUR DAYS IN THE BELFAST TWO THOUSAND TWO WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS L. REMEMBER THE PAIN 
I WAS IN EVERY TIME I FOUGHT MY 
ARM WENT MY BACK WAS TIGHT YOU 
HAVE TO TRY TO HOLD IT TOGETHER 
FIVE FIGHTS IT IS VERY TOUGH L. 
REALLY HOPE THESE GUYS STAY HEALTHY 
I REMEMBER GOING IN THE CHANGING 
ROOM ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DAVID WAS 
IN THE FINAL HAVE KNOWN DAVID 
SINCE HE WAS YOUNG IT BROUGHT 
LUMP TO MY THROAT HE WAS SITTING 
DOWN HE HAD ICE STRAPPED TO PARTS 
OF HIS BODY HE LOOKED FREAKISH HE 
DID NOT LOOK NORMAL HE WAS 
KNACKERED HE WAS SHATTERED BUT SO 
WAS HIS OPPONENT YOU CAME GOOD ON 
THE NIGHT 
THAT IS THE WAY IT GOES 
SOMETIMES L. CANNOT EXPLAIN WHAT IT 
IS LIKE IT IS HARD HAVING A FIGHT 
AND HAVING WON THE NEXT DAY THAT 
IS BAD ENOUGH BUT TO KEEP GOING 
THROUGH THE PAIN OF BOXING IT IS A 
TOUGH SPORT TO DO IT IN A 
TOURNAMENT SITUATION IS SOMETHING 
ELSE 
MOST OF THE BOXERS HERE ARE 
COMPETING IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS 
FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT THAT IS NOT 
SOMETHING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT ANTHONY 
OGOGO OGOGO APPEARED ON BIG 
BROTHER AND USED HIS FIFTEEN MINUTES OF 
FAME TO GREAT EFFECT TO LAUNCH 
MODELLING CAREER BUT THIS KID CAN 
FIGHT HE IS COMPETING HERE IN THE 
SIXTY NINE TELEGRAMS FINAL 
WE KNOW ABOUT ANTHONY OGOGO BUT 
WHAT ABOUT HIS OPPONENT LUKE 
ROBINSON IS A RECENT CONVERT TO 
BOXING HAVING TRANSFERRED FROM 
RUGBY LEAGUE TWO YEARS AGO HE IS 
CONFIDENT THAT HIS COMBINATION OF 
STRENGTH AND AGGRESSION WILL SEE 
HIM WIN THE TITLE 
IT MUST BE WONDERFUL 
TO SEE THE NUMBER OF BRITISH BOXERS 
GOING TO BEIJING 
IT IS L. REMEMBER 
AUDLEY HARRISON AT THE TWO THOUSAND 
OLYMPICS THEN AMIR KHAN GOES TO 
GET A SILVER NOW WE HAVE GOT EIGHT 
IT IS CRAZY 
THIS IS WHERE OGOGO'S EXPERIENCE 
SHOULD COME INTO PLAY HE HAS 
FOUGHT SOMEBODY WHO HAS HAD DOZENS 
OF INTERNATIONAL FIGHTS AND HE 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE PACE 
HE IS GETTING IN AND OUT OGOGO 
BUT HE IS GOING IN STRAIGHT LINE 
HE GOT CAUGHT THERE 
ROBINSON IS SO 
STRONG HE REMINDS ME OF A 
PROFESSIONAL FIGHTER THE TOOK A 
BIG ONE THERE FROM OGOGO AND 
SLIPPED 
ROBINSON CAN CERTAINLY SLIPPED PUNCHED A BIT HE STOPPED JAMIE 
MCLOUGHLIN IN THE QUARTER FINAL BUT 
OGOGO HAS TOO MUCH 
HE HAS CAUGHT 
HIM HE HIS HUT HE IS REALLY HAD 
VERY CALLOUS OF HIM HUT 
PELOUS IT SHOULD BE A POINT TO 
ROBINSON WHY HAS THAT NOT 
REGISTERED THEY HAVE GOT RECORD THAT 
OGOGO IS IN TROUBLE HE NEEDS THAT TO KEEP A COOL HEAD HERE 
BETTER BY 
OGOGO 
A GOOD RESPONSE IT JUST OGOGO SHOWS THAT THERE IS A FAULT BE IT 
BECAUSE THE REFEREE GAVE HIM A 
STANDING COUNT IT WAS A SHOT THAT 
LANDED IF THAT POINT DOESN'T SCORE 
L. DON'T KNOW WHAT HE HAS TO DO HE 
COULD HAVE KNOCKED HIM OUT WITHOUT 
SCORING A POINT 
WE HAD FUN AND GAMES WITH THE BELT 
IT STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOURTH 
ROUND ROBINSON WILL MAKE A DECENT 
GO OF THIS BELL HIS COMPOSURE 
HAS BEEN SHAKEN 
IT HAS MESSED HIM 
UP HE IS SUCH A SLICK BOXER HE 
HAD ALL THE PUNCHES IN THE BOOK 
BUT THIS GUY ROBINSON HAS COME OUT 
WITH DAMAGED DETERMINATION AND 
GREAT HE IS TRYING TO WEIGH DOWN 
THE CLASSIER OGOGO 
THERE WAS THE 
RIGHT HAND TELL ME WHAT WAS WRONG 
WITH THAT 
IF THAT DOESN'T SCORE I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE HAS TO DO IT 
WAS RIGHT ON THE BUTTON 
THIS IS 
NOT GERMANY CHAPS THIS IS BETHNAL 
GREEN OGOGO TO HIS GREAT CREDIT 
CAME BACK AT THE END AND THAT WAS 
A LOVELY LONG REACHING RIGHT HAND 
BUT HE KNOWS THAT THIS FELLOW CAN 
HIT HIM THERE IS WHAT THEY ARE 
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THEY HAVE 
THOSE KEYPADS AND IF THEY LAND 
PROPERLY THEY SHOULD BE PRESSED 
BUT THAT KNOCKED DOWN WAS NOT 
RECORDED AS SCORING A POINT 
KNOCKDOWN 
ROBINSON HAS NOT TAKEN A BACKWARDS 
STEP AND HE KNOWS HE HAS TO KNOCK 
OGOGO OUT 
HE NEARLY DID IT AGAIN 
WITH THE LEFT HAND A GREAT LEFT 
HAND FROM OGOGO THOUGH 
HE IS DOING 
WHAT HE SHOULD DO HE IS TRYING TO 
BREAK ROBINSON'S SPIRIT HE IS 
TRYING TO GET HIS RESPECT HE DID 
NOT GET IT IN THE EARLIER ROUNDS 
BUT HE IS GETTING IT IN THE LATE 
ROUNDS 
IN THE OLD DAYS THEIR WORK ROUNDS COINS BEING THROWN IN CUT HALF 
CROWNS BOUNCING OFF YOUR HEAD 
THERE WERE 
THIS GUY IS LIKE A 
STEAM TRAIN THIS IS HIS STYLE HE 
IS VERY EFFECTIVE HE IS NOT 
BOTHERED ABOUT FINESSE AND STYLE 
HE JUST WANTS TO GET HIS MAN L. L. LOVED IT 
DESPITE ROBINSON'S EFFORTS THAT 
WAS A VERY GOOD SHOT BY OGOGO THAT 
DID CONNECT HERE COMES ROBINSON 
AGAIN 
NO ONE COULD QUESTION AGAIN ROBINSON'S CHAIN HERE HE HAS TAKEN 
OGOGO'S BEST AND HE KEEPS COMING 
OGOGO HAS DONE VERY WELL WITH THAT 
ROUND THE CORNER RIGHT HE USES HIS 
LUCK WORK FOR ANOTHER POINT TO PICK 
UP L. DON'T THINK ROBINSON HAS 
TAKEN A BACKWARDS STEP OR MIGHT HE HE HAS NOT HE HAS GOT A PROFESSIONAL 
STYLE IT IS LIKE A PROFESSIONAL 
VAZ IS AN AMATEUR HERE OGOGO HAS 
GOT THAT TYPICAL AMATEUR POINT 
SCORING SYSTEM 
ROBINSON IS OUT OF 
THE BLOCKS IF THIS WAS A TWENTY ROUND 
CONTEST THIS KID WOULD STILL BE 
HERE WHAT A GREAT LAST ROUND WHAT 
A GREAT CONTEST ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH NO POINTS SCORED BY THE 
UNFORTUNATE ROBINSON BUT OGOGO'S 
SKILL HAS SEEN HIM THROUGH HIS HIS EXPERIENCE AND PEDIGREE HAS WON HIM 
THIS FIGHT ALTHOUGH HIS 
INTERNATIONAL FIGHTS HE HAS HAD 
AND ROBINSON HAS NOT HAD IT IS 
CLEAR TIZZY CLEAR TO SEE THAT THAT IS GOING TO GIVE ROBINSON A COUPLE 
OF POINTS SO HE WILL MOVE UP TO 
FOUR POINTS BUT OGOGO HAS DONE 
ENOUGH TO WIN AND HE BECOMES THE 
SENIOR A. B. A. CHAMPION BUT HE HAD A 
VERY HARD FIGHT AND HE MUST HAVE 
WONDERED IF HIS NIGHT WAS OVER WHEN 
HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE SEAT OF HIS 
PANTS BUT HE REGAINED HIS 
COMPOSURE DESPITE ALL THE PRESSURE 
BY ROBINSON 
A LOVELY SHOT BY OGOGO 
BUT AS I SAID AT THE START OF THE 
CONTEST HIS FITNESS WAS REALLY 
TESTED HE CAME THROUGH IT BUT YOU 
HAVE TO CREDIT ROBINSON HE FORCED 
THE FIGHT ON EVERY STEP 
HE DID 
EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD TO DO ROBINSON 
WAS SO TOUGH AND SO STRONG HE 
SHOWED HIS CLASS DEDICATION AND 
FITNESS AND HE SHOWED WHY HE IS ONE 
OF THE TOP GUYS IN THE COUNTRY HE HE CHASED AND HE MADE THAT AS HARD AS 
TO BE 
HE DID A VERY STRONG KID L. L. 
WAS DOWN BUT I GOT BACK UP AND I 
DID WHAT I HAD TO DO L. AM HAPPY 
DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT I SHOULD 
HAVE HAD THIS TITLE EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO 
AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD IN TWO THOUSAND SIX L. LOVE 
THE WAY I WAS TIERED SO I AM HAPPY 
YOU SAW HOW HAPPY I WAS A MINUTE 
AGO THIS SHOULD BE MY SECOND TITLE 
BUT I HAVE GOT MY TITLE NOW ARE ARE YOU SAYING THAT BY RIGHTS YOU 
SHOULD BE GOING TO BEIJING 
I DON'T 
KNOW IF I WON THE BABY AS LAST 
YEAR I GUARANTEE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THAT I 
WOULD BE A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT BETTER BOXER THAN I 
AM NOW WHEN I WAS DEFEATED IF YOU 
WILL I DIDN'T LET MY CONFIDENCE 
UNFOLD IT HAS TAKEN ME EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
TO GET BACK TO WHERE I WAS THAT IS 
BECAUSE OF THE SHOCK TO MY 
CONFIDENCE BUT I AM HAPPY BECAUSE 
I HAVE THE A. B. A. TITLE I CAN'T 
COMPLAIN 
WE TALK ABOUT THE DEEPER COMPLAIN TALENT PAUL BUT THE FLIPSIDE IS 
THAT SOME VERY GOOD BOXERS ARE LEFT 
AT HOME POOL 
THAT IS THE WAY IT 
WORKS YOU CAN'T SEND MORE THAN TWELVE 
BOXERS SO YOU'RE LEFT WITH THE 
SITUATION THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX 
WEIGHTS AND BOXERS HAVE ARGUMENTS 
SAYING I SHOULD BE THERE NOT THE 
MAN WHO IS GOING THERE IS A KID 
FROM SHEPHERD'S BUSH WHO LIVES IN 
CHAMPION LIVES IN HAMMERSMITH 
AND HE IS THE CHAMPION GEORGE GEORGE GROVES MIDDLEWEIGHT SEVENTY FIVE KILOS 
ALMOST A. B. A. CHAMPION TOOK ONE THOUSAND SIX 
TWO THOUSAND SIX AMBITION GOAL LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
OLYMPICS 
TWENTY YEAR OLD GEORGE GROVES OLYMPICS IS ONE OF BRITISH BOXING'S MOST 
OUTSTANDING TALENTS SKILFUL 
POWERFUL A FIGHTER WITH STYLE HE 
HAS ALREADY WON AND MAY BE A TITLE 
AND A LOT OF JUNIOR TITLES BUT IT 
IS HIS ATTRACTION TO THE FANS WHICH 
IS MOST IMPRESSIVE HE IS NOT GOING 
TO BEIJING HE WOULD BE A CONTENDER 
IN CHINA HE IS PART OF A NEW BREED 
AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD HE COULD BE 
A LONDON OLYMPICS BOY 
THERE IS 
NOTHING BETTER THAN BOXING IN FRONT 
OF YOUR OWN FANS IMAGINE DOING 
THAT IN AN OLYMPIC STADIUM WITH THE 
WHOLE WORLD WATCHING YOU L. WOULD 
LOVE TO BE ABLE TO BOX IN THE 
LONDON OLYMPICS IN FRONT OF MY MUM 
AND DAD 
IN THIS CLUB YOU HAVE GOT 
A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE THE 
MIDDLEWEIGHT IS GOING TO BEIJING 
AND IS FROM THIS CLUB YOU BOXED 
HIM IN THE A. B. A.'S AND BEAT HIM IT IS 
LIKE THE ULTIMATE COMPETITION IT IT WAS A BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW L. L. 
HAVE MISSED OUT ON THE OLYMPICS BUT 
I KNOW WHY AM GOOD ENOUGH TO DO IT 
BECAUSE I HAVE BEATEN AT LEAST FOUR 
OF THE EUROPEANS OUT OF THE EIGHT 
THAT ARE GOING 
IN THEORY THE A. B. A.'S 
ARE MEANT TO BE EASY THESE DAYS SO 
PEOPLE ARE TELLING ME IS THAT THE 
CASE 
OF COURSE NOT YOU MAY NOT CASE HAVE THE VOLUME OF ABOUT SUE HAD A 
COUPLE OF DECADES AGO BUT I BOXED 
EIGHT TIMES IT IS DIFFICULT IT IS 
MORE IMPORTANT THAN A LOT OF 
INTERNATIONALS YOU SHOULD ALWAYS 
HAVE TO PROVE YOUR DOMESTIC LEVEL 
IF YOU WIN AND A. B. A. TITLE YOU 
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SIT ON THAT 
FOR FIVE YEARS THERE ARE SO MANY 
GOOD FIGHTERS COMING THROUGH 
WHEN PEOPLE DO GO PROFESSIONAL YOU 
CAN'T BLAME THEM THEY HAVE GOT 
AMBITIONS AND GOALS THEY WANT TO 
WIN THE GOLD TITLE AS DAVID HAYE 
OR JOE CALZAGHE HAS DONE IT IS A 
GREAT ACHIEVEMENT IT IS NOT THAT 
THEY ARE ALWAYS CHASING THE POUND 
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS THERE 
YOU SAY DAVID HAYE AND JOE CALZAGHE 
WHEN THEY ARE SITTING DOWN AND 
RELAX IN THEY SAY THEIR BIGGEST 
REGRETS WERE THAT THEY DID NOT GO 
TO THE OLYMPICS IF THEY COULD TURN 
BACK THE CLOCK FORGET THE MILLIONS 
FORGET THE WORLD TITLE THEY HAVE 
THAT OLYMPIC GLORY 
I LISTEN TO 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE AND DONE 
IT THE ONE THAT STICKS OUT FOR ME 
IS OSCAR DE LA HOYA HE IS THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL BOXER EVERYONE LOVES 
HIM THE BEST THING HE SAYS HE HAS 
DONE IS TO WIN HIS GOLD MEDAL AS 
LONG AS THE A. B. I. CAN PROVIDE YOU 
WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO LIVE AND HAVE 
A FAMILY AND DO THE THINGS YOU WANT 
TO DO A. B. A. WITHOUT HAVING TO 
WORRY ABOUT TRAINING THREE TIMES A 
DAY IT DOESN'T ADD UP BUT 
EVERYONE LOVES AMATEUR BOXING NONE 
OF THEM WANT TO GO PRO AND 
SOMETIMES IT IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE 
TO DO WHAT I HAVE BEEN DREAMING 
ABOUT HIS BOXING IN FRONT OF SO 
MANY FRIENDS AND FAMILY YOU GET 
SUCH A GREAT ATMOSPHERE REALLY 
ESPECIALLY IN YOUR CALL YOU HAVE 
GOT THE TERRORS OF PEOPLE UP THERE 
YORK HALL IT IS IN YOUR FACE 
EVERYONE IS SO EXCITED ABOUT IT 
GROUPS' OPPONENT MAKES ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILES 
ROUND TRIP FROM MANCHESTER AND HE 
IS DETERMINED TO MAKE HIS 
DEDICATION PAID THESE TWO GUYS 
HAVE BEEN ROOM MATES FOR ENGLAND 
BUT NOW THEY ARE RIVALS NOT 
FRIENDS 
IT IS GREAT TO SEE 
JAMES GOING TO BEIJING TO REPRESENT 
BRITAIN WE HAVE WATCHED HIM IN 
RECENT YEARS HE BEAT DANIEL 
SULLIVAN FROM IRELAND IT WOULD BE 
FUN AND GAMES IF THEY WERE TO MEET 
AT AN EARLY STAGE 
A GOOD RIGHT 
HAND FROM GROVES 
KIRKHAM GETTING 
CAUGHT WHILE GROWTH IS TURNING IT 
ON 
HE LOOKS LIKE HE IS LOOKING FOR ON THE KNOCKOUT NOT AT THE POINT HE WON HIS LONDON SEMI FINAL IN A 
STOPPAGE AND HIS A. B. A. QUARTER AND 
SEMI FINALS IN A STOPPAGE HE IS 
AIMING TO DO THAT HERE SIX TO TWO UP IN 
THE SECOND ROUND KIRKHAM HOLDING 
TWO OR THREE OF THE ATTACKS FROM 
GROVES HAVE PUSHED HIM BACK TO THE 
ROPES AND RESTRICTED HIS MOVEMENT 
HE HAS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO AND 
GROVES FOLLOWS THROUGH WITH A RIGHT 
HAND GROVES WANTS KIRKHAM TO TRY 
TO PRESSURE HIM GROVES IS A 
COUNTER PUNCHER AND HE IS LOOKING 
FOR A SHOT BUT IT IS NOT COMING AS 
YET 
A RIGHT HAND BODY SHOT FROM YET GROVES AND HE CAUGHT HIM WITH A 
LEFT L. THINK KIRKHAM KNOWS THAT IF 
HE STANDS TOE TO TOE THERE IS ONLY 
GOING TO BE ONE WINNER AND IT IS 
NOT GOING TO BE HIM EXACTLY EXACTLY GROVES IS PUT IN SOME MEAT ON TO 
THE SHOPS HE IS REALLY FEELING IT 
PUTTING MAYBE RENNY REALISES HOW 
FAR BEHIND HERE SLIPPING HE WILL 
COME FORWARD MORE WHEN HE 
REALISES 
KIRKHAM IS LOSING HIS POSITION IN 
THE RING HE HAS TO STICK TO THE 
CENTRE WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE 
ROPE HE IS GETTING CAUGHT HE HAS 
TO STAY IN THE CENTRE FOR ME A A GREAT NOISE IN THE YORK HALL EIGHT TO THREE 
IN FAVOUR OF THE DEFENDING CHAMPION 
GEORGE GROVES 
SOLID RIGHT HAND RIGHT TO THE 
MIDRIFF A CRACKING SHOT YOU CAN 
SEE KIRKHAM SAYING TO HIMSELF I 
DON'T LIKE THIS ONE LITTLE BIT L. DON'T BLAME HIM 
HE STARTS ALL HIS 
COMBINATIONS WITH A SOLID SHOT TO 
THE BODY TO BRING THE HANDS DOWN 
AND IT IS WORKING A TREAT IF HE 
KEEPS THAT UP HE IS GOING TO START 
RACKING THE POINTS UP 
QUITE A PACE 
RICHIE CAN THEY MAINTAIN THIS FOR 
FOUR MORE MINUTES 
I THINK THEY 
WILL QUITE EXPERIENCED BUT THEY 
CAN KEEP THIS UP 
COLE KIRKHAM CERTAINLY CAN'T WAIT 
TO GET BACK INTO IT KARL KIRKHAM 
GROVES PICKS IT UP AS HE GOES 
THROUGH THE FIGHT HE PICKS UP THE 
PACE AND STARTS THROWING BETTER 
SHOTS LET'S SEE IF HE DOES THAT 
YOU NEED TO FACE YOUR OPPONENT AT 
ALL TIMES REMEMBER OH THERE WAS 
AN AIR SHOT IN GOLFING PARLANCE 
GROVES HAS TO START GROVES GOES 
WITH A BODY ASSAULT ONCE AGAIN 
THERE WAS A LITTLE INCIDENT AT THE 
START OF THE ROUND THAT WE SHOULD 
SEE MORE OF FROM KIRKHAM HE HAS TO 
MAKE GROVES FALL SHORT WITH HIS 
RIGHT HAND AND GET BACK AT HIM 
GOOD PRESSURE BOXING FROM GROVES 
KIRKHAM DID WELL TO SURVIVE IT 
NEARLY SCORED WITH A DECENT RIGHT 
GROVES KNOWS HE IS IN THE LEAD SO 
HE'S HAPPY TO START COUNTERING LET 
KIRKHAM MAKE MISTAKES AND MAKE HIM 
PAY 
MAYBE A SIGN THAT KIRKHAM IS PAY GETTING TIRED 
A COUPLE OF GOOD 
LEFT HOOKS FROM GROVES NOT FAR 
AWAY HE IS STARTING TO LAND WITH 
THAT SHOT 
KIRKHAM DID WELL TO 
AVOID A BIT OF VARIATION FROM 
KIRKHAM TRYING TO DRAW THE HANDS 
DOWN A GOOD SHOT BY KIRKHAM 
CLOSES THE GAP TO FIVE AND ANOTHER 
GOOD SHOT BY KIRKHAM WELL WHAT DO 
YOU THINK 
HE IS REALLY DOING WHAT 
HE NEEDS TO DO TRYING TO SCORE BIG 
SHOTS AND TRYING TO SLOW DOWN 
GROVES GROVES KNOWS HE IS IN THE 
LEAD GROVES IS DOING THE RIGHT 
THING BUT HIS OPPONENT IS VERY 
STRONG 
KIRKHAM HAS HAD A VERY GOOD STRONG SEQUENCE COMING UP TO THE END OF 
THIS ROUND HE HAS CLOSED THE GAP 
TO THREE POINTS 
HE IS HURT HE HAS 
GOT KIRKHAM IN A BIT OF TROUBLE AND 
HE IS REALLY TURNING IT ON GROVES 
WHEN HE NEEDED IT HE CONCEDED 
THREE POINTS AND TO HIS GREAT 
CREDIT HE CAME BATTLING BACK WITH 
A COUPLE OF HIS OWN WHAT A FINISH 
A GOOD FINISH HE HAS GOT AN IN 
BUILT CLOCK GROVES THE LAST TWENTY 
SECONDS HE POURS ON THE PRESSURE 
HE TURNED IT AROUND HE DID EXACTLY 
WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO HE CAUGHT A 
COUPLE OF SHOTS HE LOST A COUPLE 
OF POINTS BOXERS HAVE A LITTLE 
COMPUTER IN THEIR BRAIN AND THEY 
KNOW WHEN THEY ARE LOSING POINTS 
HE KNEW HE HAD TO STEP ON THE GAS 
AND PICK UP SOME WELL NEEDED POINTS 
THAT WAS THE ACTION FROM THE START 
AT THE END THIS IS GROVES HAVING 
CONCEDED THREE POINTS IN TWENTY SECONDS 
HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I NEED TO DO 
SOMETHING SPECIAL MY WORD RICHIE 
HE DID 
YEAH HE DID IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE ROUND HE STEPPED OFF THE GAS 
HE ALLOWED KIRKHAM TO COME BACK 
THE ALARM BELLS WERE RINGING AND HE 
GOT BACK IN CONTROL 
LOOK AT 
KIRKHAM SAYING COME ON IS THAT 
THE BEST YOU HAVE GOT L. TELL YOU 
THIS HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY 
CRACKING MIDDLEWEIGHT FINAL L. BET 
JAMES DE GAIN IS HAPPY HE IS GOING 
TO BEIJING 
BOTH GUYS THROWING 
QUALITY SHOPS SHOTS EIGHT EIGHT BRITISH BOXERS FIVE IRISH BOXERS 
IN THE BEIJING OLYMPICS 
CARL KIRKHAM KNOWING HE IS BEHIND 
A GOOD SHOT GREAT LEFT HAND 
GROVES COMES BACK THIS IS A BUILT 
IN FIGHT RICHIE WOODHALL GREAT GREAT SHOPS GROVES IS PICKING HIS 
PUNCHES KIRKHAM IS ON THE FRONT 
FOOT BUT GROVES IS COMING BACK WITH 
QUALITY SHOTS GROVES KNOWS HE IS 
IN THE LEAGUE SO HE DOESN'T NEED TO 
TAKE ANY UNNECESSARY RISKS IN 
THE LEAD HE JUST HAS TO COUNTER 
KIRKHAM WITH SOLID SHOTS 
A MINUTE 
TO CLOSE THE GAP ONE MORE SOLID 
PUNCH FROM GROVES WOULD SEAL IT 
DAVID 
YEAH HE IS DOING EXACTLY DAVID THE RIGHT THING NOT TAKING RISKS 
HE KNOWS HE HAS THE LEAD HE HAS TO 
HOLD ON TO THE LEAD 
KIRKHAM WITH A 
RIGHT GROVES COMES STRAIGHT BACK 
WELL BLOCKED BY KIRKHAM 
A COUPLE 
OF GOOD SHOTS FROM GROVES HE 
SWITCHED DOWNSTAIRS AND THEN HE 
SWITCHED UPSTAIRS WITH THE LEFT 
HOOK 
YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE KARL HOOK KIRKHAM AT EVERY SINGLE PRAISED 
AGAINST THE DEFENDING CHAMPION 
GROVES HAS HAD TO WORK FOR EVERY 
SINGLE POINT DAVID HAYE 
HE REALLY 
HAS IT WAS A LOT TOUGHER THAN I 
ANTICIPATED GROVES HAS HAD TO DIG 
DEEP L. HAVE NOT HAD TO SEE HIM DIG 
DEEP IN THE A. B. A. SO FAR HE HAS 
ADDED HIS OWN WAY THIS TIME HE HAS 
HAD TO REALLY WORK FOR IT 
A GREAT 
ATMOSPHERE IN A GREAT VENUE AND A 
GREAT FINAL IN A GREAT DIVISION 
TWO QUALITY BOXERS KIRKHAM HAS HAD 
SUCCESS IN THIS ROUND AND PUT THE 
PRESSURE ON WITH THE STRAIGHT LEFT 
HAND ESPECIALLY 
GOOD COVERING UP 
BY GROVES KIRKHAM LOOKING BIG AND 
STRONG THIS IS TERRIFIC GEORGE 
GROSZ HAS RETAINED HIS TITLE A 
VERY GOOD RUN UP GEORGE GROVES 
THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE STAND OUT 
FINALS OF THE EVENING IN BETHNAL 
GREEN GEORGE GROVES A RATHER 
NASTY LOOKING SWIRLING UNDERNEATH 
HIS LEFT EYE COURTESY OF SOME GOOD 
PUNCHING BY KIRKHAM SWELLING 
THIS COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY IT IT WAS A CLASS FIGHT BUT I DEFINITELY 
FEEL THAT THE CLASS CAME FROM 
GEORGE GROVES HE DID WHAT HE 
NEEDED TO DO THE EXTRA EXPERIENCE 
HE HAS HAD INTERNATIONALLY ALLOWED 
HIM TO HAVE THE DISCIPLINE AND 
FOCUS TO STICK TO HIS GAME PLAN AND 
NOT GET DRAWN IN WHEN HE DIDN'T 
NEED TO 
GEORGE FOR SO MUCH OF 
THAT YOU WERE ON TOP JUST A WOBBLE 
IN THE LAST ROUND YOU LOOKED LIKE 
YOU MIGHT LET IT GO 
YEAH I MEAN 
THE LAST ROUND IS ALWAYS THE 
HARDEST WHERE YOU ARE UP OR DOWN 
IF YOU'RE DOWN YOU HAVE TO GO FOR 
IT LIKE KIRKHAM DID IF YOU ARE 
AHEAD YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE 
LEAD L. HAD TO FIGHT INSIDE FOR A 
LOT OF THE FIGHT THE LAST ROUND I 
CARRIED IN CARRIED ON WITH WHAT I 
WAS DOING HE HAD MORE HUNGER 
BECAUSE HE WAS SIX DOWN IT MADE IT 
INTO A GOOD FIGHT 
YOU GOT THE WIN 
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS 
EXACTLY TWO 
TIME A BE A CHAMPION A. B. A. 
CHAMPION L. AM ECSTATIC WITH IT 
DON'T TELL JAMES 
WE HAVE DIFFERENT 
VIEWS 
THAT IS BOXING VIEWS WARREN BAISTER IS JOINER BY DAY 
AND A BOXER BY NIGHT HE HAS WON 
ALL BUT TWO OF HIS TWENTY TWO CONTESTS HIS 
OPPONENT JOE HARVEY SERVED IN 
AFGHANISTAN 
BACK THEY COME THE BIG MAN IN RED 
WARREN BAISTER FROM SUNDERLAND EIGHT 
ONE UP AGAINST JOE HARVEY FROM THE 
NAVY IMPORTANT TO FINISH THE ROUND 
WELL AN IMPORTANT STOP AROUND WELL 
BAISTER HAS DONE BOTH GOOD LEFT 
HAND 
GOOD WORK FROM BAISTER BUT HE HAND HAS TO CONCENTRATE ON BOXING MID 
LONG RANGE AGAINST THIS KID THERE 
YOU GO 
NOT A LOT BEHIND IT BUT IT 
WAS A GOOD ENOUGH SHOT HE TOOK ONE 
IN REPLY THE GAP STILL EXISTS 
BAISTER MUST BE CAREFUL IF HE DROPS 
THE LEFT WHICH HE HAS GONE ON A 
FEW OCCASIONS HE WILL GET CAUGHT 
A BIT OF HOLDING THERE THE SECOND 
TIME BAISTER HAS BEEN CAUTIONED 
REMEMBER IF IT GOES TO A WARNING 
IT WILL BE A COUPLE OF POINTS ADDED 
ON TO HIS OPPONENT IS HE CUT THEY 
ARE HAVING A LOOK AT HIS EYE HIS 
LEFT EYE A LAST A NASTY LITTLE 
NICK THIS IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE 
BAISTER IS IN A COMMANDING LEAD AT 
THE MOMENT THE DOCTOR WILL SEE IF 
IT IS THREATENING IF IT'S STOP ON 
A CART NO HE IS GOING TO BE 
ALLOWED TO BOX ON STOCKED UP ON 
A CUT AWFUL TO LOSE ON A CUT THIS 
WILL SPUR ON JOE HARVEY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY LIKE A RED RAG TO LABEL HE'S 
COMING BACK TO A 
WATCHED THE HEAD WHAT A GREAT 
RESPONSE FROM BAISTER AND AGAIN 
WHAT A LEFT HOOK A BEAUTIFUL SHOT 
TO THE BODY 
A LOT OF BLOOD FROM 
THE NOSE OF HARVEY IN A LITTLE BIT 
OF TROUBLE HE'S LOOKING A BIT 
WEARY THE HUGE FLURRY FROM BAISTER 
HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON HARVEY HE 
WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR THE BELL 
BAISTER GOT HIM AGAIN AROUND THE 
CORNER WITH A RIGHT HAND AND AGAIN 
AND AGAIN 
THIS IS A GOOD ROUND BY BAISTER 
DESPITE THAT LITTLE CUT 
I TELL YOU 
WHAT THIS KID HARVEY IS AS HARD AS 
NAILS HE REALLY IS HE HAS TAKEN 
SOME BIG SHOTS BUT HE IS STILL 
THERE AND HE IS COMING BACK 
HE IS 
WOBBLING HARVEY HIS LEGS ARE ALL 
OVER THE PLACE THAT RESPONSIVE 
FLURRY FROM BAISTER ONCE HE KNEW HE 
HAD BEEN CUT AND HE DID NOT KNOW 
HOW BAD IT WAS HIS CORNER WILL 
TELL HIM IT IS NOT THAT BAD AT ALL 
THE DOCTOR SAID HE WAS FINE TO 
CARRY ON BUT WHAT A RIPOSTE BY 
BAISTER IT HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD 
HEAVYWEIGHT CONTEST THIS JOE 
HARVEY GOT HIS BLOODY NOSE CLEAN UP 
HE KNOWS HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO 
STOP HIS MAN TO WIN THIS IF HE CAN 
MAKE THE CUT WORSE WHO KNOWS WHAT 
MIGHT HAPPEN WARREN BAISTER FROM 
SUNDERLAND SIXTEEN TO UP LOOKING VERY 
IMPRESSIVE ON THE BACK FOOT 
DOES BAISTER JUST GET ON HIS BIKE 
HE KNOWS HE HAS GOT A GOOD LEAD 
DEFINITELY IF I WAS HIS CORNER I 
WOULD SAY JUST KEEP HIS MAN AT BAY 
DON'T MAKE SILLY MISTAKES THIS GUY 
IS GOING TO COME 
HERE COMES HARVEY 
GOOD DEFENCE BY BAISTER BOTH IN 
TERMS OF HIS HANDS AND HIS FEET 
GETTING HIM OUT OF TROUBLE GOOD 
FOOTWORK BY THE BIG FELLOW THAT 
WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIS HEAD SOME WAY 
INTO THE MIDDLE OF MIDDLESEX IF IT 
HAD IT GOOD STUFF BY BAISTER 
HAD HIT 
THIS IS THE BETTER 
POSITION FOR HARVEY 
WE MUST REMEMBER THAT BAISTER LOST 
BY A SINGLE POINT TO THE EVENTUAL 
CHAMPION DANNY PRICE LAST YEAR IN 
THE QUARTER FINALS THOUGHT HE 
MIGHT HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO GET THE 
DECISION PRICE HAS GONE ON TO 
GREATER THINGS BAISTER I THINK 
THAT'S IN FRONT OF HIM IT HAS BEEN 
A HARD TOUGH FINAL BUT BAISTER HAS 
HAD THE EDGE IN TERMS OF SKILL YES YES HIS QUALITY HAS SHOWN HE HAS TO 
STICK TO THE CENTRE OF THE RING 
THAT'S BETTER BOXING STAY OUT OF 
THE CORNERS 
HARVEY THROWING 
EVERYTHING INTO IT BUT IT'S A LOST 
CAUSE GOOD WORK BY THE TWO FISTED 
SAILOR BAISTER TIRING BUT HE HAS 
THE ENERGY TO COME BACK CAN HE 
FINISH IN STYLE THE BILL IS ABOUT 
TO SOUND WARREN BAISTER 
DISAPPOINTED LAST YEAR LOSING TO 
THE EVENTUAL CHAMPION HAS BECOME 
THE CHAMPION THIS YEAR STARTED 
SLOWLY AND IT BUILT UP IN THE END 
IT WAS A VERY GOOD HEAVYWEIGHT 
FINAL 
WHAT A GREAT BOUT BAISTER FINAL WAS TESTED TO THE VERY END HARVEY 
WAS ALWAYS IN WITH A CHANCE WITH 
THE RIGHT HAND SOME GREAT STUFF 
WHAT A GOOD BODY SHOT THERE FROM 
HARVEY 
THAT JUST ABOUT SUMS IT UP BAISTER 
WAS FIRST WITH THAT PUNCH AND HE 
KEPT HIS MAN AT ARM'S LENGTH BOTH 
LITERALLY AND METAPHORICALLY IN 
TERMS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE 
SCOREBOARD BAISTER WAS TWO 
FISTED WITH GREATER VARIATION 
CLEARLY HAPPY WITH THE TITLE 
UNDERPERFORMANCE 
I HAVE CHANGED UNDERPERFORMANCE THE FEW THINGS SINCE I HAVE MOVED 
IT IS ALL COMING TOGETHER NOW L. AM 
BOXING WELL 
HE HAD SKILL BUT HE 
JUST KEPT COMING AND COMING 
HE IS 
A STRONG LAD HE WAS GETTING ON MY 
NERVES AT THE END 
HAD YOU FEEL 
WHEN YOUR HAND WAS RAISED RELIEF RELIEF I HAVE BEEN TRAINING SOLIDLY SINCE 
JANUARY 
A LONG TIME 
WITHOUT A JANUARY DOUBT 
UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE DOUBT TIME TO SHOW YOU WHAT THEY FINALS 
SO HERE IS A ROUND UP 
BAT LIGHT FLYWEIGHT VICTORY WENT 
TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TOMMY STUBBS FROM 
NORTHSIDE IN THE RED GLOVES AND 
THE HEAD GUARD HE WAS THE BETTER 
OF THE HITTERS AND HE BEAT 
HODDESDON'S BEN FOWL 
THE HEAVIER HITTING OF THE ARMY'S 
ADAM WHITFIELD IN BLUE WAS THE 
KEY AT FLYWEIGHT HIS OPPONENT 
ADAMS 
BRADLEY EVANS TOOK THE 
FEATHERWEIGHT BOMBERS HE BEAT LEE 
GILLESPIE AND HIS SNAPPY PUNCHING 
CONTINUED TO BE TOO MUCH OR 
GILLESPIE GILLESPIE IN THE LIGHT WELTERWEIGHT DIVISION 
A FAMILY HAT TRICK WAS COMPLETED BY 
LIAM SMITH HE JOINED HIS BROTHERS 
PAUL AND STEPHEN ON GABA ROLL OF 
HONOUR AND HE DENIED THE ARMY A 
TREBLE ON THE NIGHT 
THE LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE HAS 
GONE TO HUNGARY IT STANDS SUITS 
IN BLUE IS ELIGIBLE FOR LONDON 
SZUCS HIS EXPERIENCE TOLD AGAINST 
MICHAEL FIELDING ALTHOUGH THE WIND 
WAS WORKMANLIKE RATHER THAN 
IMPRESSIVE THE WIN THE FINAL AT 
EIGHTY SIX KILOGRAMS WAS MORE ABOUT POWER 
AND GUILE MATHEW ASKIN WON DESPITE 
BEING HANDED TWO TWO PENALTIES 
THE FINAL BELL RED NINE TO SEVEN 
NOW IT IS TIME FOR THE BIG BOYS 
THE SUPER HEAVYWEIGHT FINAL IT WAS 
IN THIS WEIGHT CLASS THAT AUDLEY 
HARRISON ANNOUNCED HIS ARRIVAL WITH 
A PAIR OF A. B. A. TITLE WINS THE DOOR 
IS OPEN FOR A NEW NAME AND ONE OF 
OUR FINALISTS AS A NAME TO REMEMBER 
TYSON FURY STANDS A TOWERING SIX F. T. SEVEN 
AND WEIGHS OVER EIGHTEEN STONE A FORMER 
WORLD JUNIOR BRONZE MEDALLIST 
LOOKING FOR HIS FIRST HONOURS IN 
THE SENIOR RANKS HIS OPPONENT IS 
DAMIEN CAMPBELL FROM REPTON HE IS 
LOOKING TO GO ONE BETTER HAVING 
BEEN THE RUNNER UP 
TYSON FURY NEARLY PUSHED BACK INTO 
HIS CORNER BY THE REFEREE HE IS 
LOOKING PRETTY COMFORTABLE THAT THAT WAS GOOD WORK FROM FURY CAMPBELL CAMPBELL HAS PICKED UP A POINT AT LAST FURY FURY MISSING WITH THE RIGHT HAND IT HAS 
NOT BEEN ALL THAT ACCURATE THE THE PROBLEM WITH CAMPBELL IS THAT HE 
CANNOT COPE WITH THE SIZE OF THE 
MAN AND THE PACE OF THE CONTEST 
TYSON FURY AGAINST DAVID PRICE 
WOULD BE AN INTERESTING SCRAP 
WOULDN'T IT 
I WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE A REFEREE IN 
THAT ONE 
NINE WANT TO FURY COMING UP 
TO THE MIDWAY POINT AND HE IS 
PILING ON THE PRESSURE NINE TO ONE 
CAMPBELL IS NOT QUITE ABLE TO COPE 
HE HAS BEEN VERY GAME 
FURY'S CONFIDENCE IS SKY HIGH 
THERE IS THAT LITTLE TIME TO GAIN 
FROM FURY 
A UNSURPRISED THAT 
DIDN'T COUNT A GOOD BODY SHOT FROM 
CAMPBELL I AM SURPRISED THIRTY 
SECONDS TO GO THEN TWO MORE 
MINUTES AND FURY IS LOOKING STRONG 
OF THE TWO HE IS CERTAINLY THE 
MORE POWERFUL AND CAMPBELL HAS 
DONE WELL SO FAR DENYING FURY A 
WIN ON THE WAY TO WHAT LOOKS LIKE 
BEING HIS H. T. A. CROWN ONE PUNCH 
COULD CHANGE ALL THAT ESPECIALLY 
WITH THESE FELLOWS A. B. A. HE HE CAUGHT FURY WITH A GREAT BRIGHT 
BOOK IT WAS A GOOD SHOT THERE THERE WERE TWO GOOD SHOTS THIS EVENING 
THAT HAD NOT BEEN RECOGNISED DUE TO 
THE COMPUTER SCORING SYSTEM 
CAMPBELL LOOKS ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED 
HAS HE GOT TWO MORE MINUTES HE HAS 
GOT TO FIND THEM FROM SOMEWHERE 
THAT WAS A TOUGH ROUND FROM HIM HE 
DIDN'T CONCEDE TOO MANY POINTS BUT 
THE STRENGTH AND AGGRESSION OF 
TYSON FURY WAS ALL OVER HIM THE THE JAB FOLLOWED UP WITH THAT'S 
STRAIGHT RIGHT HAND GOOD WORK FROM 
TYSON FURY THERE WAS A LITTLE 
MOVEMENT THERE AND HE TRIED TO GET 
THROUGH ON THE RIGHT HAND HE IS 
TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS ALL THE 
TIME WHAT A GREAT UPPERCUT AND 
THAT MUST HAVE SCORED 
IT SHOULD 
HAVE SCORED BUT THE JUDGES WOULD 
HAVE NEEDED THE BENEFIT OF THE 
OVERHEAD CAMERA TO BE FAIR 
LAST TIME HE ENTERED THE SENIOR 
A. B. A.'S THE BIG FELLOW IN THE BLACK 
VEST AND RED TRUNKS WAS BEATEN TWENTY TWO 
EIGHT BY DAVID PRICE WHO WENT ON 
TO TAKE THE TITLE LAST TIME AND 
WILL BE GOING TO BEIJING TYSON 
WANTS TO PROVE THAT APART FROM 
PRICE HE IS AT THE BEST SUPER 
HEAVYWEIGHT IN BRITAIN AND HE IS 
GOING ABOUT IT THE RIGHT WAY IT 
HAS BEEN A FAST MOVING CONTEST FROM 
TWO HEFTY GUYS 
THEY HAVE BEEN SOME 
SOLID RIGHT HANDS AT THE START OF 
THIS ROUND THE BOXING IS SUPERB 
CAMPBELL IS LOOKING TIRED NOW 
THEIR HANDS ARE DOWN A GOOD RIGHT 
HAND AND AGAIN FURY WOULD LOVE TO 
STOP THIS ONE IF HE CAN THE 
REFEREE HAS STEPPED IN FURY HAS TO 
GO BACK TO THE NEUTRAL CORNER 
CAMPBELL IS EXHAUSTED THERE IS 
MINUTE TO GO AND I WOULDN'T BE 
SURPRISED IF FURY COULD DO THIS 
CAMPBELL HAS PRIDE BUT PRIDE HAS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT IT IS ALL 
ABOUT STRENGTH AND POWER CAMPBELL 
IS WOBBLING HE IS READY TO GO THE 
REFEREE IS HAVING A GOOD LOOK AT 
HIM ONE MORE SHOCK AND THE REFEREE 
SHOULD STOP THIS 
HE IS ON THE 
VERGE FAIR PLAY TO CAMPBELL HE IS 
STILL THERE HE TOOK SOME BIG SHOTS 
IN THAT EXCHANGE L. THOUGHT THE 
REFEREE WAS GOING TO JUMP IN 
CREDIT TO CAMPBELL HE IS STILL 
THERE 
SUCH IS THE NOISE THAT TYSON THERE FURY HAS BEEN DEMANDED TO BREAK HE 
NEEDED A HUGE GULP OF AIR THIS 
ENORMOUS MAN CAMPBELL HAS DONE 
REMARKABLY WELL TO WITHSTAND THIS 
BAZOOKA LIKE BARRAGE FROM TYSON 
FURY 
WHAT A SUSTAINED ATTACK FROM FURY FURY 
MANY BOXERS WOULD HAVE SAID FURY I'M NOT TAKING ANY MORE OF THIS AND 
WOULD HAVE FOUND AN EXCUSE TO GET 
OUT THERE BUT DAMIEN CAMPBELL 
DIDN'T HE'S DONE THAT AND TOOK IT 
LIKE A GOOD ONE BUT TYSON FURY WAS 
TOO BIG AND TOO STRONG AND DAMIEN 
CAMPBELL LIGHTING WILL HAVE TO 
CONCEDE THAT HE WAS OUTGUNNED IN 
EVERY DEPARTMENT 
HE SHOWED A LOT 
OF HEART AND BOTTLE LOOK AT THE 
RIGHT HANDS FROM FURY HE PINNED 
HIS MAN ON THE ROPES THERE IS THAT 
RIGHT HAND WHAT A SHOT THAT WAS A 
CRACKER L. WAS EXPECTING THE 
REFEREE TO COME IN THERE BUT 
CAMPBELL WOULD NOT QUIT FAIR PLAY 
TO HIM BUT A SUSTAINED ATTACK FROM 
TYSON FURY GOOD STUFF 
DID THAT GO 
AS YOU EXPECTED 
YES L. KNEW HE WAS 
A STRONG KID AND I WASN'T GOING TO 
TRY TO KNOCK HIM OUT L. GOT THE JOB 
GOING AND GOT THE JOB DONE SEASON SEASON AFTER SEASON IT IS STARTING TO 
COME TOGETHER

PRESSURE AND GETTING THAT BOOST WAS 
A HIGHLIGHT 
WHAT WAS YOUR 
HIGHLIGHT 
IT OFTEN HAPPENS ON THE HIGHLIGHT ONE THEY COME THROUGH FIVE OR SIX 
BOUTS THEY GET HERE AND SOMETIMES 
THEY CANCEL EACH OTHER UP IT 
HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES TONIGHT 
WEASELS AND QUALITY BOXERS GETTING 
INVOLVED IN FIGHTS THAT WERE NOT 
ENTERTAINING BUT THERE WERE STILL 
SIX OR SEVEN GOOD QUALITY FIGHT 
LET'S START WITH THE BIG BOYS 
TYSON FURY HE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 
SO LONG L. REMEMBER FOUR YEARS AGO 
I WAS OFFERED A PIECE OF HIM AS 
THEY SAY IN AMERICA HE WAS SIXTEEN 
THAT IS LIKE TRAFFICKING CHILDREN 
I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM SOMEONE 
SAYING IF YOU WANT IN ON TITAN IT 
IS ONE HUNDRED GRAND IT IS MAD HE IS NOW 
COMING ON NICELY TYSON FURY 
UNLIKE GEORGE GROVES I LIKED 
KIRKHAM I'M PLEASED TO SAY HE IS 
BACK INSIDE THE BRITISH SYSTEM L. L. LOVED 
CAMPBELL I 
LOVED THE 
KID FROM THE ARMY MARTIN STEAD 
WHO DIDN'T SEEM TO GET TOUCHED L. 
ALSO LIKED RICKY NEWLANDS ALSO 
THAT LITTLE LIGHT FLYWEIGHT WHO 
LOOKED LIKE A GIANT AGAINST THE 
OTHERS TOMMY STUBBS ZERO WAS 
IMPRESSED WITH HIM WHEN I GO BACK 
OVER THAT IT WAS NOT SUCH A BAD 
NIGHT FOR A THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
COMPANY AT YOUR CONTRIBUTION HAS 
BEEN FANTASTIC 
THAT IS IT FROM HERE BUT STAY WITH 
US FOR ATHLETICS AND THE GREAT 
MANCHESTER RUN ONCE AGAIN THE A. B. A. 
FINALS HAVE DELIVERED SOME GREAT 
BALLADS WHO KNOWS FOR SOME BOXERS 
THAT COULD BE THE START OFF A 
BRILLIANT CAREER OUR NEXT BOXING 
IS FROM THE BEIJING OLYMPICS WHERE 
EIGHT BRITISH BOXERS ARE CHASING 
THE ULTIMATE PRIZE IN THE SPORT 
LET'S LEAVE YOU WITH REMINDER OF BRITAIN'S FLAG BEARERS AT THE GAMES 
GOOD AFTERNOON IT HAS NOT BEEN A 
FUN WEEK IN MANCHESTER WITH THE 
UEFA CUP INVASION AND THE 
SUBSEQUENT CLEAR UP THIRTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
PUT THE GREAT INTO THE GREAT 
MANCHESTER RUN THIS IS THE U. K.'S 
BEST TEN KILOMETRES EVENT 
ONE OF THE GOLDEN GIRLS WE SAW 
REBECCA ROMERO A DOUBLE WORLD MAP 
MEDALLIST AT THE WORLD TRACK 
CHAMPIONSHIPS YOU WILL BE STARTING 
THE RACE TODAY I WONDER FOR AN 
ADOPTED MANCUNIAN WHAT DOES IT 
MEAN TO YOU 
IT IS IMMENSE TO BE 
HERE STARTING A RUN WHEN THE 
PREVIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE THAT 
SUPERSTARS IN THE SPORT HAVE 
ALREADY DONE IT IT SHOWS HOW MY 
PROFILE HAS ROCKETED SINCE WINNING 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONS HERE IN 
MANCHESTER 
THAT WAS A FANTASTIC MANCHESTER ACHIEVEMENT AS YOU SAY YOUR 
PROFILE HAS SHOT THROUGH THE ROOF 
HOW OTHER PREPARATIONS FOR BEIJING 
IT HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLE THE 
AMOUNT OF PUBLICITY I HAVE HAD AND 
INTEREST AND IT IS DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE IT IS NEW TO ME HAVE 
BECOME WORLD CHAMPION AS AN 
INDIVIDUAL AND I WANT TO CELEBRATE 
BIT AND GET INVOLVED BUT AT THE 
TIME IT WAS FOUR MONTHS AND NOW 
THREE MONTHS UNTIL THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES THERE IS NO TIME FOR IT L. 
HAVE GOT TO PUT IT TO ONE SIDE AND 
MOVE ON AND I AM HAVING TO 
DISAPPOINT A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT I 
HAVE THE ULTIMATE GOAL TO ACHIEVE 
WHICH IS AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL AND 
I CAN'T LET ANYTHING GET IN THE WAY 
OF THAT 
THEN WE ARE VERY GLAD THAT 
YOU HAVE AGREED TO COME DOWN AND 
BLOW THIS HORN TO START THE RACE 
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT AND IN BEIJING 
THE MAN YOU WILL BE DOING WITH HIS 
IS DENIS LAW VIRTUALLY AN EVER 
PRESENT AT THE START HERE L. KNOW 
YOU PLAYED A BIG PART IN THE UEFA 
CUP HERE IN MANCHESTER EARLIER THIS 
WEEK CAN YOU SUM UP THE ATMOSPHERE 
NOW IN THE CITY AND THE 
DETERMINATION TO KEEP GOING AFTER 
THE EVENTS 
I THINK REALLY IT WAS A 
SHAME BECAUSE THE ATMOSPHERE 
BEFORE WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
BUT AS SOON AS THE PROBLEM CAME 
AFTER THE GAME THE MANCHESTER 
PEOPLE REALISED THAT THE MAJORITY 
OF THE RANGERS FANS WERE ABSOLUTELY 
EXCELLENT ALL OVER THE CITY IN 
AND AROUND THE CITY AND IT REALLY 
WAS JUST THAT LITTLE MINORITY THAT 
CAUSED THE PROBLEM THEY WERE NOT 
TRUE RANGERS FANS THE TRUE FANS 
WERE ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT AND 
EVERYONE IN THE CITY WILL WELCOME 
THEM BACK ANY TIME 
GLAD TO SEE YOU 
BACK ON THE START LINE NEXT TO YOU 
IS A DAPPER MAN WHO WILL BE RUNNING 
IT THE LEADER OF THE COUNCIL L. 
KNOW WHAT IS YOUR FIRST TIME ON 
THE SUBJECT OF THE WAY TO GOD WHAT 
IS THE MESSAGE FROM THE PEOPLE OF 
MANCHESTER 
THIS IS OUR FOURTH MAJOR MANCHESTER EVENT IN THE CITY THIS YEAR L. 
THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE A FAR 
MORE TYPICAL MANCHESTER TODAY 
CERTAINLY THE STREETS OF PEOPLE 
BUT ENJOYING THEMSELVES THE SUN 
SHINING I THINK IT WILL REPRESENT 
AN IMAGE OF MANCHESTER AS IT REALLY 
IS 
THE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT YOU IS HAVE GOT NUMBER FIFTY ON THE CHEST BY 
TRYING TO BREAK FIFTY MINUTES WE 
LOOK 
I AM TRYING TO BREAK FIFTY LOOK MINUTES AND IT WILL REMIND ME I I THINK WE SHOULD REMIND PEOPLE OF 
SOME OF THE ELITE ATHLETES THAT 
WILL BE RUNNING PAST REBECCA AND 
DENNIS TODAY 
BRITAIN'S JO PAVEY DEFENDS THE 
TITLE SHE WON IN STYLE LAST YEAR 
AND SHE HAS GOT A WORLD CHAMPION 
FOR COMPANY KATHARINE GO IN THERE 
THE OSAKA MARATHON GOLD MEDALLIST 
LUKE KIBET IS THE HEADLINE A IN THE 
MEN'S RACE TODAY SOME OF THE GREAT 
NAMES IN DISTANCE RUNNING HAVE WON 
THIS RACE OVER THE YEARS BUT NO 
ONE HAS COME BACK AND MANAGED TO 
RETAIN THE TITLE THAT IS WHAT 
BRITAIN'S JO PAVEY IS TRYING TO DO 
ANY FUN AND RUNNERS STRUGGLING TO 
LAST THE COURSE SHOULD DRAW COMFORT 
FROM THE FACT THAT IT SHOULD BE AS 
DIFFICULT FOR THE ELITE ATHLETES UP 
AHEAD AS JO PAVEY PROVED WINNING 
LAST YEAR'S RACE 
I WAS DELIRIOUS 
BY THE END L. WAS EXHAUSTED L. 
TRIED TO HOLD ON FOR A WIN L. 
STARTED RUNNING THE WRONG WAY L. 
HAVE TO MAKE SURE I DO NOT DO THAT 
THIS YEAR 
YOU FOUND THE FINISH 
LINE AND YOU WERE VICTORIOUS IT IS 
GOING TO BE TOUGH THIS YEAR TELL 
ME WHAT YOU EXPECT TO DO IN THE 
RACE 
IT IS A VERY TOUGH RACE RACE KATHARINE NDEREBA THE WORLD 
CHAMPION FROM OSAKA AND MARGARET 
OKAYO SOME CHALLENGING BRITISH 
ATHLETES TOO LIKE LIZ EALING THE 
WAY SHE RAN THE LONDON MARATHON WAS 
AWESOME LIZ EALING 
DESCRIBE THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BUILD UP TO 
THE OLYMPICS AND NOT BEING ON THE 
TRACK IT IS USEFUL TO RUN ON THE 
ROAD 
IN AS 
FAR 
AS MAKING 
SURE YOU 
DO NOT GET INJURED BEFORE BEIJING 
IT IS GOOD PREPARATION TO RUN THAT 
DISTANCE IN A RACE WITH THAT LEVEL 
OF EXERTION IT IS VERY GOOD FOR 
YOU AND IT MAKES YOU TOUGH JO JO PAVEY SHOWED OUT SHE WAS AT LAST 
YEAR'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN OSAKA 
FINISHING FOURTH AND MISSING OUT ON A 
MEDAL IN THE TEN THOUSAND METRES 
I WAS 
FRUSTRATED IN OSAKA TO MISS OUT ON 
A MEDAL IT IS PLEASING IT GIVES 
ME THE DETERMINATION TO KEEP 
TRAINING HARD AND TRY TO IMPROVE ON 
THAT BEEN HERE
