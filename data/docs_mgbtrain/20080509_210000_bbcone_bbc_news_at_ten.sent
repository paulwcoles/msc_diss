FOREIGN AID GETTING TO ITS PEOPLE 
AID AGENCIES WARN THOUSANDS 
DIE URGENT HELP REGIME 
CONFISCATES SUPPLIES BROUGHT IN IN 
BY THE UN BUT IT DOES CONTINUE ITS 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN URGING PEOPLE TO 
VOTE IN TOMORROW'S REFERENDUM IT'S 
ESTIMATED AL MILLION AND A HALF 
PEOPLE ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF 
HELP WE'LL BE LOOKING AT WHAT THE 
AID AGENCIES CAN DO TO TRY TO REACH 
THEM ALSO TONIGHT TWO SCHOOLBOYS 
MURDERED IN TWO SEPARATE INCIDENTS 
BOTH BY TEENAGE GANGS THE KILLERS 
ARE JAILED TODAY 
I BELIEVE IN A 
LIFE FOR LIFE AND PLEAD THAT THESE 
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SHOWED SO LITTLE 
REMORSE THROUGHOUT THE HEARINGS 
SERVE THE FULL TIME WITHOUT PAROLE 
THE ECONOMIC SQUEEZE TIGHTENS AS 
THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGE REPOSSESSION 
ORDERS JUMPS TO OVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
IF I MISS A PAYMENT THAT'S IT 
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THE HOUSE OFF 
ME BASICALLY I'M GOING TO LOSE MY 
HOME 
AND THE SWIMMER MAKING HOME HISTORY IN THE BEIJING OLYMPICS 
NOT THE PARALYMPICS BUT 
WAS A MISTORY LIQUID RESPONSIBLE 
FOR A FATAL EXPLOSION IN NORTH 
LONDON AND HOW NEW IMMIGRATION 
RULES WILL AFFECT FOREIGN CARERS 
AND THE VULNERABLE PEOPLE THEY LOOK 
AFTER 
GOOD EVENING THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT IS TONIGHT ACCUSED OF 
LETTING ITS PEOPLE DIE IN THEIR 
THOUSANDS WHILE AID STACKS UP ON 
ITS BORDERS IT'S EVEN IMPOUNDED 
SUPPLIES THAT DID GET IN ON TO UN 
PLANES IT'S ESTIMATED A MILLION 
AND A HALF PEOPLE ARE IN DESPERATE 
NEED AFTER LAST WEEK'S CYCLONE AID 
AGENCIES BURMA DOESN'T HAVE THE 
MANPOWER NOR EXPERTISE TO DEAL WITH 
THE HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE THE 
B. B. C. THEY WERE TAKEN BY BURMESE AID 
WORKERS AND CONTAIN GRAPHIC IMAGES 
OF DEAD BODIES YOU SHOULD LOOK 
AWAY NOW FEW DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM 
THE BODIES OF MANY WHO DROWNED ARE 
STILL IN THE WATER IF LEFT THERE 
THEY'D LIKELY INCREASE THE SPREAD 
OF INFECTIONS SUCH AS CHOLERA AND 
DYSENTERY MANY STILL LIE WHERE 
THEY PROBABLY DIED SOME BODIES 
HAVE BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE WATER 
PLACED SIDE BY SIDE ON THE RIVER 
BANK BANK THERE'S ALSO AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT AID 
WORKERS COULD BE DOING TO HELP THE 
SURVIVORS SURVIVORS THIS REPORT CONTAINS SOME GRAPHIC 
IMAGES IMAGES SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE CYCLONE STRUCK 
THINGS AREN'T GETTING MUCH BETTER 
FOR THE PEOPLE STILL STRANDED IN 
THE IRRAWADDY DELTA 
BODIES LIE STREWN ACROSS THIS 
LANDSCAPE LOCAL RED CROSS WORKERS 
TOLD US DISEASES LIKE DYSENTERY 
WERE ALREADY GETTING A GRIP AND 
YET THERE IS STILL NO RELIEF EFFORT 
TO MATCH THE SIZE OF THE 
CATASTROPHE THE CYCLONE CAUSED 
ENORMOUS DESTRUCTION TEARING APART 
HOMES KNOCKING DOWN BRIDGES AND 
BLOBGT ROADS BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO 
HAVE BEEN THE MAIN CAUSE OF THOSE 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEATHS THE 
TIDAL SURGE FORMED IN THE WAKE OF 
THE CYCLONE WASHED AWAY ENTIRE 
COMMUNITIES HUSBANDS AND WIVES 
MOTHERS AND CHILDREN SWEPT APART 
IN AN INSTANT NOW THE SURVIVORS 
SEARCH FOR THEIR LOVED ONES BUT 
THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE TO HELP 
THEM THEM AND THAT'S HOW IT MAY STAY FOR 
TODAY THE MILITARY LEADERS TOLD THE 
WORLD THEY INTENDED TO RUN THIS 
RESCUE EFFORT ON THEIR OWN 
AID WAS WELCOME BUT THE EXPERTS 
WITH THE SKILLS TO DELIVER IT WERE 
NOT NOT WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE 
WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK AND TO 
SAVE LIVES BECAUSE IF WE DELAY 
IT'S LIVES POTENTIALLY LOST AND 
CERTAINLY AN EPIDEMIC RIGHT ON OUR 
DOORSTEP DOORSTEP BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THAT FAR 
OUT OF THE CAPITAL TO SEE THAT 
DESPITE THEIR PRESENT EFFORTS THE 
TASK IS JUST TOO BIG FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT TO GO IT IT ALONE THE 
DESTRUCTION IS OBVIOUS AND SO IS 
THE FACT THAT A FEW HOURS FROM 
RANGOON PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE 
HELP THEY NEED 
BUT FOR THE TIME BEING THE 
DISCUSSION ON GETTING IN MORE AID 
WORKERS SEEMS TO BE OVER 
THE BURMESE OFFICIALS WHO PROCESS 
THE VISAS HAVE JUST CLOSED THEIR 
OFFICES FOR A THREE DAY HOLIDAY 
NO SUCH LUCK FOR THE MILLION OR 
MORE PEOPLE LOCKED AWAY IN THE 
FLOODED DELTA 
SO A WEEK ON FROM THE CYCLONE 
WITH THE AID OPERATION LARGELY 
BLOCKED BY BURMA'S GENERALS WHAT 
OPTIONS ARE THERE FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BRIAN 
HANRAHAN IS HERE 
FIONA THE 
WARNING TO THE BURMESE GENERALS IS 
STARK FROM EVERY SIDE THEY'RE 
BEING TOLD MANY MORE PEOPLE WILL 
DIE UNLESS THEY OPEN UP THEIR 
COUNTRY TO OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE ONE 
SENIOR AID OFFICIAL SPOKE OF HIS 
FEARS OF AN EPIDEMIC OF APOCALYPTIC 
PROPORTIONS BUT NOTHING IT SEEMS 
CAN SHAKE THE JUNTA'S POLICY OF 
KEEPING THEIR COUNTRY SEALED STATE STATE T. V. PUTS THE GENERALS FRONT AND 
FOREMOST THE DISASTER IS BEING 
TREATED AS AN EXTENDED PHOTO 
OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE THE FUTURE OF 
THE JUPB TABUT AT THE AIRPORT THEY 
NEED HUMAN CHAINS TO UNLOAD EVEN A 
HANDFUL OF PLANES 
ALONE BURMA COULDN'T HOPE TO COPE 
WITH THE HUNDREDS OF AIRCRAFT AND 
THOUSANDS OF TONNES OF CARGO NEEDED 
FOR A MAJOR RELIEF EFFORT BUT THE 
GENERALS HAVE THEIR MINDS ELSEWHERE 
THE COUNTRY'S BEING PREPARED FOR A 
NEW REFERENDUM TOMORROW ON A NEW 
CONSTITUTION EVEN THOUGH IT WILL 
DIVERT RESOURCES BADLY NEEDED TO 
DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS IN THE 
FLOODED DELTA 
AND WHILE THE GENERALS 
PROCRASTINATE THE COUNTDOWN TO A 
SECOND CATASTROPHE CONTINUES 
WITH ANY BIG DISASTER EARLY 
INTERVENTION IS CRUCIAL WITHIN THE 
FIRST THREE DAYS AID AGENCIES 
WOULD HOPE TO ESTABLISH AN AID FLOW 
TO THE AFFECTED AREAS BUT IT'S A 
WEEK SINCE THE CYCLONE STRUCK IN 
BURMA AND THAT IS STILL TO HAPPEN 
ONLY ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE HAVE 
RECEIVED EVEN THE MOST BASIC HELP 
THAT LEAVES THE SURVIVORS 
INCREASINGLY WEAK THROUGH 
STARVATION AND DEHYDRATION AS THE 
DAYS GO BY THAT MAKES THEM 
VULNERABLE TO DISEASES LIKE CHOLERA 
DENGUE FEVER AND TYPHOID WITHOUT 
HELP SOON THE DEATH TOLL WILL 
CLIMB RAPIDLY BUT VALUABLE TIME 
HAS BEEN SQUANDERED THE FLOOD 
WATERS HAVE DESTROYED MUCH OF THE 
REGION'S SFRUR WITH ROADS BRIDGES 
AND BOATS ALL DAMAGED HELICOPTERS 
ARE THE ONLY WAY TO REACH PEOPLE 
QUICKLY BURMA IS BELIEVED TO HAVE 
ONLY A HANDFUL AND IN DUBIOUS 
CONDITION CONDITION BUT A STATEMENT BY BURMA'S UN 
AMBASSADOR THIS EVENING LEFT IT 
UNCLEAR IF HIS COUNTRY WOULD ACCEPT 
PRACTICAL HELP 
WE ARE MOST 
THANKFUL TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY OUR FRIENDS NEAR AND FAR 
FOR THE SOLIDARITY AND GENEROSITY 
AND I'D LIKE TO GO ON RECORD AND 
SAY THAT WE WILL ACCEPT AID FROM 
ANY QUARTER 
THE UNITED STATES HAS 
SHIPS AND HELICOPTERS AVAILABLE 
BUT BURMA HAS IGNORED SUCH OFFERS 
OF HELP IT HAS AGREED TO ALLOW 
SINGLE U. S. TRANSPORT PLANE TO LAND 
IN RANGOON ON MONDAY THAT WON'T 
MAKE MUCH PRACTICAL DIFFERENCE BUT 
IT COULD CHANGE THE DIPLOMATIC 
CLIMATE CLIMATE THE BURMESE REGIME KEEPS SHIFTING 
ITS POSITION ABOUT EVEN THE LIMITED 
QUANTITY OF AID IT WILL ACCEPT 
THIS STOP START APPROACH SUGGESTS 
THERE'S A POWER STRUGGLE GOING ON 
WITHIN THE RULING JUNTA RIGHT NOW 
THE FACTION THAT'S WINNING IS THE 
ONE THAT DOESN'T MIND HOW MANY 
PEOPLE DIE 
THE AID AGENCIES ARE APPEALING FOR 
HELP THEY SAY THE NEED IS 
IMMEDIATE AND VAST AND THERE ARE 
FULL DETAILS OF HOW 
TO CONTRIBUTE 
ON THE WEBSITE AT 
THE DAY'S OTHER NEWS A SENIOR 
POLICE OFFICER HAS CALLED ON PARENT 
TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY AFTER 
TEN TEENAGERS WERE JAILED FOR THE 
MURDER OF TWO SCHOOLBOYS KODJO 
YENGA AND PAUL ERHAHON WERE STABBED 
IN INCIDENTS BOTH HAD BEEN SET 
UPON BY TEENAGE GANGS THE FACES OF 
THOSE KILLED IN GANG VIOLENCE LAST 
YEAR TODAY JUSTICE FOR TWO OF 
THEM FOURTEEN YEAR OLD PAUL ERHAHON ON 
THE LEFT DIED AFTER BEING STABBED 
IN WALTHAMSTOW WHILE KODJO YENGA 
AGED SIXTEEN WAS ATTACKED A MONTH 
EARLIER AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
LONDON KODJO AN A GRADE STUDENT 
WAS SET UPON BY A GANG IN 
HAMMERSMITH IN MARCH LAST YEAR 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TOOK TO THE 
STREETS IN ANGER AND DISBELIEF 
NONE COULD MAKE SENSE OF THE DEATH 
OF A YOUNGSTER WITH SO MUCH TO LIVE 
FOR TODAY HIS FRENCH SPEAKING 
MOTHER SAW HER SON'S KILLERS JAILED 
BUT THEN THE MESSAGE 
IS KODJO WILL NEVER COME HOME 
AGAIN SO IRRESPECTIVE OF THE 
SENTENCES THE PAIN WILL BE WITH 
HER FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE THE 
BOYS WILL COME OUT IN FIFTEEN YEARS AND 
THEY'LL HAVE ANOTHER SIXTY YEARS AHEAD 
OF THEM 
TWO OF THOSE KILLERS WERE 
CONVICTED OF MURDER AND SENTENCED 
TO A MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN YEARS 
THREE OTHERS IN THE GANG WERE 
JAILED FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS FOR 
MANSLAUGHTER MANSLAUGHTER SUCH SENTENCES SAID THE JUDGE 
WERE DESIGNED TO SEND A CLEAR 
MESSAGE THAT THE COURTS ARE READY 
TO TACKLE GANG CRIME WHICH IS HE 
CONSIDERED A GROWING SOCIAL 
PROBLEM PROBLEM THERE WERE ANGRY SCENES OUTSIDE 
COURT AS THE KILLERS OF PAUL 
ERHAHON WHO WANTED TO BE A 
STOCKBROKER WERE ALSO JAILED TWO 
WILL SERVE AT LEAST THIRTEEN YEARS AND 
ANOTHER AT LEAST ELEVEN YEARS 
IF YOU 
GO OUT ON THE STREETS WITH YOUR 
FRIENDS AND YOU KNOW YOUR FRIENDS 
ARE CARRYING A KNIFE AND YOU CARRY 
AND ARM YOURSELF AS WELL THEN THE 
COURTS ARE GOING TO FIND YOU GUILTY 
AS IF YOU HAD INFLICTED THAT FATAL 
BLOW 
FORMER GANG MEMBER DARRELL BLOW JAMES RUNS ANTI GANG WORKSHOPS IN 
EAST LONDON TEENAGERS HE SAYS 
NEEDS TO BE GIVEN A BETTER OPTION 
TO GANG LIFE 
EDUCATION IT'S ALL 
ABOUT EDUCATION AND IT'S A TYPE OF 
EDUCATION THEY'RE GETTING NOW NEED 
CHANGING BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING 
I'M A DIRECT PRODUCT OF THE 
EDUCATION ITSELF 
ON THESE STREETS GANGS ARE FOR 
YOUNGSTERS THE PROMISE OF RESPECT 
BUT WITH TWO TEENAGERS DEAD AND A 
FURTHER TEN STARTING JAIL TERMS 
TOTALLING WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS THE 
COSTS OF GANG MEMBERSHIP CAN BE 
HIGH HIGH FURTHER SIGNS OF THE SQUEEZE ON THE 
HOUSING MARKET EMERGED TODAY WITH 
FIGURES SHOWING LARGE JUMP IN THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT RISK OF LOSING 
THEIR HOMES THE COURTS ISSUED 
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MORTGAGE REPOSSESSION ORDERS 
IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THIS 
YEAR YEAR IT'S THE SIGN OF A HOUSING MARKET 
YOU DON'T SEE ON THE PROPERTY SHOWS 
MICHELLE WALSH BOUGHT HER TWO 
BEDROOMED HOUSE IN NORFOLK IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
NOW SHE'S JUST ONE MISSED PAYMENT 
AWAY FROM BEING REPOSSESSED I'VE I'VE ACTUALLY GOT TWO POSSESSION ORDERS 
ON MY HOUSE WHAT THAT BASICALLY 
MEANS IS IF I MISS A PAYMENT ON 
WHAT'S BEEN ORDERED AT THE COURT 
THEN THEY CAN GO BACK AND THEY CAN 
REPOSSESSION MY HOUSE WITHIN TWENTY EIGHT 
DAYS DAYS IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT MORE PEOPLE 
ARE HAVING TROUBLE PAYING THEIR 
DEBTS TODAY'S FIGURES HOAD THAT 
LENDERS APPLIED FOR OVER THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
POSSESSION ORDERS IN THE FIRST 
THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR THAT'S 
SIXTEEN PER CENT MORE THAN THE SAME TIME IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
BUT IT'S STRIKING THAT THE NUMBER 
OF APPLICATIONS HAS BEEN GOING UP 
SHARPLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE LONG BEFORE THE 
HOUSING MARKET GROUND TO A HALT 
CLEARLY LENDERS ARE RESORTING MORE 
QUICKLY TO THE COURTS OFTEN TO 
PROD BORROWERS TO SELL OR MAKE A 
DEAL BUT NOT ALL OF THOSE 
APPLICATIONS WILL ACTUALLY BE 
GRANTED AND ONLY ABOUT ONE IN FOUR 
WILL ACTUALLY LEAD TO PEOPLE'S 
HOUSES BEING REPOSSESSED AND 
PEOPLE CAN LOSE THEIR HOMES BECAUSE 
OF OTHER DEBTS BUT THE NUMBER OF 
MORTGAGE REPOSSESSIONS IS STILL 
WELL BELOW THE HIGHS REACHED IN THE 
EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES 
WE THINK THAT THIS 
YEAR WE'RE GOING TO SEE A TOTAL OF 
ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND REPOSSESSIONS 
ALTHOUGH THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT RISE 
ON LAST YEAR'S TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND IT'S STILL 
REPRESENTS FEWER THAN ONE IN THREE HUNDRED 
BORROWERS SO I THINK IT'S A 
REASONABLE LEVEL OF RISK THE 
IMPORTANT THING IS THAT MOST PEOPLE 
CAN AVOID THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS 
IF THEY TALK TO THEIR LEARNED EARLY 
THE GOVERNMENT SAID TODAY IT WAS 
GOING TO DO MORE TO HELP 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE IN ALL THE 
COUNTY COURTS THAT DEAL WITH 
REPOSSESSION CASES THERE IS FREE 
LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR PEOPLE WHO 
ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOME 
WE'VE ANNOUNCED THAT WE'RE GOING TO 
STRENGTHEN OUR HOUSING ADVICE 
SERVICE SO THAT MORE INFORMATION 
CAN BE GIVEN TO PEOPLE HAVING TO 
LOOK AT REFINANCING THEIR MORTGAGES 
THE EXTRA HELP COULD COME IN HANDY 
FOR PEOPLE LIKE MICHELLE WALSH BUT 
MINISTERS CAN'T TURN BACK THE CLOCK 
THANKS TO THE CREDIT CRUNCH BANKS 
ARE LENDING LESS FREELY THAN THEY 
WERE YEAR AGO AND THEY'RE GETTING 
MUCH MORE KEEN TO COLLECT 
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
THE MAN WHOSE WIFE WAS KILLED BY AN 
N. H. S. BLUNDER LESS THAN AN HOUR AFTER 
THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN IS TOLD HE 
NOW HAS TO LEAVE BRITAIN 
AND SPECIAL REPORT ON ROBERT 
MUGABE'S PLAN TO INTIMIDATE 
ZIMBABWE'S VOTERS 
IN LEBANON GUNMEN FROM THE 
HEZBOLLAH MILITIA NOW CONTROL MOST 
OF WEST BEIRUT AFTER SEVERAL DAYS 
OF FIGHTING AT LEAST ELEVEN PEOPLE 
SKRPB KILLED AND DOZENS INJURED 
THE BALANCE OF POWER IN LEBANON IS 
NOW SHIFTING SIGNIFICANTLY IN 
FAVOUR OF HEZBOLLAH WHICH IS 
BACKED BY SYRIA AND IRAN 
OUR MIDDLE EAST EDITOR IS IN BEIRUT 
JEREMY JEREMY I'VE BEEN DRIVING AROUND BEIRUT 
TONIGHT AND THE STREETS ARE SPOOKLY 
QUIET I DIDN'T SEE ANY HEZBOLLAH 
GUNMEN AND THE LEBANESE ARMY IS ON 
THE STREETS EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS 
WHERE THE POWER LIES AND THE 
STRENGTHENING OF HEZBOLLAH AND ITS 
ALLIES IN SYRIA AND IRAN IS 
REVERBERATING AROUND THE MIDDLE 
EAST EAST THE CHANGE HERE HAS BEEN SWIFT 
DECISIVE AND FOR GOVERNMENT AND 
ITS ALLIES DISASTROUS 
BY THIS MORNING AFTER A VIOLENT 
NIGHT AND DAY BEIRUT WAS QUIETER 
BUT IN A NEW AND UNCERTAIN 
POLITICAL WORLD THE GOVERNMENT 
MUST HAVE GAMBLED THAT HEZBOLLAH 
WOULD NOT PUT ITS MEN ON TO THE 
STREETS WHEN IT MOVED AGAINST IT 
THIS WEEK 
THAT MISCALCULATION HAS CHANGED THE 
BALANCE OF POWER HERE RADICALLY 
THE RESULT HAS BEEN HUMILIATION FOR 
GUTO HARRI THE LEADER OF THE 
GOVERNING BLOC WITH THE GOVERNING 
PRIME MINISTER SINORA HIS FUTURE 
MOVEMENT IS THE WEST'S BIG ALLY 
HERE THEY'RE NOT QUITE YESTERDAY'S 
MEN YET BUT THEIR WEAKNESS HAS 
BEEN RUTHLESSLY EXPOSED BEIRUTEES 
KNOW WHAT TO DO IN TIMES LIKE THESE 
MOVE TO SOMEWHERE SAFER AND STOCK 
UP WHEN YOU GET THE CHANCE THIS 
MAN SAID THE TWO MEN HAD TO REACH 
COMPROMISE HE STAYED WAS LIKE 
BEING UNDER SIEGE 
TINY LEBANON GENERATES ANXIETY 
ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST AS THE 
REGION'S CONFLICTS COME TOGETHER 
HERE IT'S SEEN AS A BAROMETER OF 
CRISIS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO SPREAD 
INSTABILITY SHIFTS IN POWER ON 
BEIRUT'S STREETS CAN GET AMPLIFIED 
ELSEWHERE ELSEWHERE UNTIL TODAY HEZBOLLAH APPEARING 
STRONG HOLD WAS THE SOUTHERN 
SUBURBS BUT NOW IT CONTROLS THE 
ENTIRE MUSLIM WEST OF THE CITY 
INCLUDING THE PORT AND THE HAMRA 
DISTRICT WHICH THE HARIRIS AND 
THEIR SUNNI FOLLOWERS REGARD AS 
THEIR TURF HARIRI'S BROADCAST 
CENTRE FUTURE T. V. WAS HERE T. WAS 
CAPTURED BY HEZBOLLAH THIS MORNING 
AND SET ON FIRE AFTER BEING TAKEN 
OFF THE AIR THE ONLY MIDDLE 
EASTERN POWERS WHO WILL RELISH THIS 
SITE ARE IRAN AND SYRIA 
HEZBOLLAH'S BACKERS THE LEBANESE 
ARMY THE ONLY NATIONAL INSTITUTION 
THAT CROSSES THE SECTARIAN DIVIDES 
HAS BEEN VISIBLE BUT UNABLE TO 
INTERVENE IN CASE IT'S SEEN AS 
TAKING SIDES BUT IT HAS CO 
OPERATED WITH HEZBOLLAH GOING INTO 
BUILDINGS THAT IT'S CAPTURED 
LATER SOUTH OF BEIRUT OF BEIRUT 
IN SIDON THE ARMY CLASHED WITH 
GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS THEIR 
LEADERS DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO 
CHALLENGE THE NEW STATUS QUO THE 
ONLY CHOICE MIGHT BE TO ACCOMMODATE 
IT INSTITUTIONALISING THE SUCCESS 
OF HEZBOLLAH AND ITS ALLIES 
THERE'S ALSO THE ISRAELI DIMENSION 
ANYTHING THAT STRENGTHENS HEZBOLLAH 
AND BY EXTENSION ITS FRIENDS IN 
SYRIA AND IRAN IN THE MINDS MUCH 
MANY ISRAELIS BRINGS THE MIDDLE 
EAST THE THE NEXT MIDDLE EAST WAR 
JUST LITTLE BIT CLOSER BACK TO 
YOU IN LONDON 
THANK YOU 
THE B. B. C. IS TO MAKE AN ON AIR 
APOLICY AFTER APOLOGY AFTER IT 
ADMITTED KEEPING MONEY WHICH SHOULD 
HAVE GONE TO CHARITY FROM A PHONE 
IN VIEWERS WERE ACCIDENTALLY TOLD 
TO RING WHEN THE LINES WERE CLOSED 
THE MONEY HAS BEEN REPAID TO THE 
CHARITIES WITH INTEREST 
A FILIPINO MAN WHOSE WIFE WAS 
KILLED BY AN N. H. S. BLUNDER HAS BEEN 
TOLD HE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE BRITAIN 
ARNEL CABRERA WAS ALLOWED INTO THE 
COUNTRY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN HIS 
WIFE WAS WORKING AS A NURSE IN A 
BRITISH HOSPITAL BUT SHE DIED THE 
FOLLOWING HERE WHEN AN EPIDURAL 
DRUG WAS MISTAKENLY INJECTED INTO 
HER ARM RATHER THAN SPINAL CORD 
WHEN SHE WAS GIVING BIRTH 
MAYRA CABRERA ARRIVED IN BRITAIN 
FROM THE PHILIPPINES FIVE YEARS AGO 
TO WORK AS A NURSE AT SWINDON SHE 
ALSO GAVE BIRTH THERE IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
TO HER FIRST CHILD ZACH BUT SHE 
DIED SHORTLY AFTER THIS PHOTO WAS 
TAKEN TAKEN A POWERFUL ANAESTHETIC DRUG WAS 
WRONGLY INJECTED INTO HER ARM 
INSTEAD OF HER SPINE AN INQUEST 
FOUND THAT SHE'D BEEN KILLED 
UNLAWFULLY THROUGH GROSS NEGLIGENCE 
MAYRA WAS MY LOVE AND LIFE HER HER HUSBAND SEEN HER AT HER INQUEST 
NOPT ONLY HAD TO COME TO TERMS WITH 
HER DEATH BUT FIGHT HIS FIGHT FOR 
DEPORTATION HE'S BEEN TOLD HE 
CAN'T STAY IN THE U. K. 
THE HOME 
OFFICE HAS A DISCRETION THEY CAN 
EXERCISE AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A 
CASE WHERE THERE ARE MORE 
SYMPATHETIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAN 
THESE SO ENABLELY HE IS 
DEVASTATED HE HAS TO GO HOME 
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT HIS WIFE 
WAS UNLAWFULLY KILLED 
AFTER HIS 
WIFE DIED MR. CABRERA SENT HIS SON 
TO LIVE WITH RELATIVES IN THE 
PHILIPPINES BUT HE ALWAYS INTENDED 
TO BRING HIM BACK TO THE U. K. TO MAKE 
THEIR FUTURE HERE THE STANCE BEING 
TAKEN BY THE HOME OFFICE IS THAT 
BECAUSE MR. CABRERA HADN'T ALREADY 
ESTABLISHED FAMILY LIFE WITH HIS 
SON HERE IN THE U. K. THEN THERE ARE 
NO INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES TO HIS 
FAMILY LIFE BEING CONTINUED 
OVERSEAS WHILE SOME OF HIS 
SUPPORTERS ARE URGING THE 
GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE THE DECISION 
MR. CABRERA'S RESIGNED HIMSELF TO 
LEAVING THE U. K. 
HE WANTS TO GET ON WITH LIFE WITH 
HIS SON WHO TURNS FOUR THIS WEEKEND 
THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS 
WIFE'S DEATH
