TO KEEP YOUR TEETH HEALTHY YOU SHOULD BRUSH TWICE A DAY 
BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE BRUSHING THEIR TEETH IS A WAY OF LIFE 
WE DO BRUSH OUR TEETH VERY OFTEN HERE 
BECAUSE WE DEVELOP NEW TOOTHPASTES 
WE'RE ALWAYS COMING UP WITH NEW IDEAS TO CLEAN TEETH BETTER KEEP GUMS HEALTHY OR MAKE BRUSHING EVEN NICER 
EVERY TIME WE DEVELOP A NEW FORMULA OR RECIPE IT OFTEN CHANGES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TOOTHPASTE 
SO WE TEST THAT IT WILL DO WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO 
AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS OFTEN WITH HUMAN VOLUNTEERS 
EACH PROPERTY NEEDS A DIFFERENT TEST PLAQUE 
NOW I JUST WANT YOU TO RINSE YOUR MOUTH WITH THIS 
WE'RE TESTING 
A NEW FORMULA OR RECIPE 
WHICH WE HOPE IS GONNA MAKE IT EASIER 
TO REMOVE PLAQUE FROM TEETH 
ANDREW HAS BEEN HELPING US BY USING THE NEW TOOTHPASTE FOR TWO WEEKS 
NOW WE'RE VERY KEEN TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT IT WORKS 
THE SPECIAL LIQUID ANDREW RINSED HIS TEETH WITH HAS STAINED THE PLAQUE YELLOW 
WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF YELLOW THAT HE HAD TWO WEEKS AGO 
AND THAT HE HAS NOW 
AND TO HELP US WORK THIS OUT WE HAVE A SPECIAL COMPUTER 
O. K. ANDREW 
YEAH THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU 
THIS COMPUTER TAKES PICTURES OF THE TEETH AND MEASURES EXACTLY HOW MUCH PLAQUE THERE IS 
COMPARE THE PICTURES OF ANDREW'S TEETH 
THE COMPUTER WORKED OUT THAT THERE WAS ALMOST ONE FIFTH LESS PLAQUE 
WHEN DEVELOPING A NEW TOOTHPASTE THIS TEST IS REPEATED ON MANY PEOPLE 
ANOTHER IMPORTANT PROPERTY OF TOOTHPASE IS TASTE 
CHRISTINE DEVELOPS NEW FLAVOURS FOR TOOTHPASTES 
EACH TIME SHE INVENTS A NEW TASTE SHE TRIES IT ON COLLEAGUES FIRST 
O. K. TOOTHPASTE A PLEASE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO STRONG IT'S O. K. THE FLAVOUR'S TOO STRONG 
TOOTHPASTE B. PLEASE 
ONCE HER COLLEAGUES APPROVE A FLAVOUR CHRISTINE HAS TO TEST IT ON A BROADER RANGE OF PEOPLE 
TWO HUNDRED WILL GIVE HER A GOOD IDEA OF HOW WELL IT'LL SELL IN THE SHOPS 
IT'S VERY NICE IT'S A LOVELY BALANCE 
HOW MUCH TOOTHPASTE FOAMS WHEN YOU BRUSH 
DOESN'T AFFECT HOW WELL IT CLEANS BUT IT DOES CHANGE HOW IT FEELS 
SO IT ALSO HAS TO BE TASTED WHEN A NEW TOOTHPASTE IS DEVELOPED 
A FIXED AMOUNT OF TOOTHPASTE AND WATER ARE STIRRED TOGETHER 
THEN FROTHED WITH A BLENDER FOR TEN SECONDS AND MEASURED 
TWO THIRTY FIVE C. M. CUBED 
THIS PASTE WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR THE CHINESE MARKET COS THEY LIKE A LOT OF BUBBLES IN THEIR PASTES 
AND THE SECOND TOOTHPASTE 
ONLY ONE FORTY FIVE C. M. CUBED 
THIS TOOTHPASTE HAS MUCH LESS FOAM AND IT WOULD BE MORE SUITED TO THE GERMAN MARKET 
THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE TESTS WE CARRY OUT WHEN THINGS DON'T WORK AS WELL AS WE WANT 
WE MUST CHANGE THE RECIPE TO FIX IT 
WHEN WE'RE SATISFIED EVERYTHING IS RIGHT THE FACTORY CAN START PRODUCING IT FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY 
IF YOU'RE FEELING THIRSTY THERE ARE LOTS OF DRINKS TO CHOOSE FROM 
BUT HOW GOOD ARE YOU AT CHOOSING A DRINK WHICH DOESN'T HARM YOUR TEETH 
IN FACT THE ONLY DRINKS WHICH DON'T DAMAGE YOUR TEETH 
ARE MILK AND STILL WATER 
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW WATCH THIS 
THIS IS A HUMAN TOOTH WE LEFT IT FOR A FEW WEEKS 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED 
AND WHEN WE COMPARE IT TO A HEALTHY TOOTH 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SHINY SURFACE THE ENAMEL HAS DISSOLVED IN THE DRINK 
BUT WHAT DOES THIS REALLY TELL US IS IT A GOOD TEST 
WE ASKED TONY SMITH PROFESSOR OF ORAL BIOLOGY AT BIRMINGHAM UNIVERISTY 
IT'S AN INTERESTING TEST TO SEE BUT IT'S HARD TO MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN DRINKS BECAUSE 
WE HAVE TO PUT DIFFERENT TEETH INTO DIFFERENT DRINKS AND ALL OF THE TEETH WILL BE DIFFERENT SIZES 
AND TO SEE CHANGES BY THE NAKED EYE IT TAKES QUITE A LONG TIME 
AND OF COURSE WE DON'T NORMALLY WALK AROUND WITH DRINKS IN OUR MOUTHS FOR WEEKS 
NINA'S TEAM HAVE DEVISED BETTER WAYS OF TESTING THE EFFECTS OF DRINKS ON TEETH 
WE VARNISH EACH TOOTH SO THAT A SMALL SPOT IS LEFT EXPOSED 
AND THAT WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME SIZE ON EACH TOOTH 
THEN WHEN THE TEETH ARE PLACED IN DIFFERENT DRINKS EACH TOOTH WILL HAVE THE SAME AREA IN CONTACT 
WITH THE DRINK 
ALL THE TEETH ARE LEFT IN FOR THE SAME TIME THE OTHER THING THAT'S DIFFERENT IS THE TYPE OF DRINK 
THIS MAKES IT A FAIR TEST 
AFTER THIRTY MINUTES WE CAN FIND OUT HOW MUCH TOOTH HAS DISSOLVED IN EACH DRINK 
A SMALL DROP OF EACH DRINK IS ADDED TO A LIQUID IF ANY TOOTH IS DISSOLVED IN THE DRINK 
THE LIQUID WILL TURN BLUE 
THE DARKER THE COLOUR THE MORE TOOTH IS DISSOLVED 
THE ORANGE JUICE AND THE COLA GAVE SIMILAR RESULTS 
WHILE MILK AND WATER DIDN'T DISSOLVE THE TOOTH AT ALL 
BUT EVEN THIS TEST ISN'T PERFECT 
THIS TEST ISN'T TOTALLY REALISTIC BECAUSE OF COURSE OUR TEETH ARE NORMALLY IN OUR MOUTHS 
WHERE WE HAVE SALIVA AS WELL AND THE SALIVA CAN AFFECT THE WAY THAT THE DRINKS DAMAGE OUR TEETH 
SO IT'S BETTER TO DO THE TEST IN PEOPLE'S MOUTHS INSTEAD OF TEST TUBES 
SO WE ASK PEOPLE TO DRINK WITH A SMALL GUMSHIELD WHICH WE PLACE OVER THEIR TEETH 
WITH SMALL PIECES OF EXTRACTED TOOTH STUCK ONTO THE GUMSHIELD 
WITH AREAS VARNISHED OVER TO PROTECT THEM TO ALLOW US TO COMPARE THE AREA THAT'S IN CONTACT WITH THE DRINK 
WITH THE AREA PROTECTED BY VARNISH 
VOLUNTEERS WEAR THE GUMSHIELDS AND DRINK THE SAME AMOUNT OF DRINK 
FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME 
A MACHINE PRECISELY MEASURES THE DAMAGE TO THE TEETH AND DISPLAYS IT ON COMPUTER 
I'VE DONE THESE TESTS ON LOTS OF DIFFERENT DRINKS ON LOTS OF TEETH 
AND THE ONLY THINGS THAT DON'T DAMAGE YOUR TEETH ARE PURE WATER AND MILK EVERYTHING ELSE DOES 
BUT THERE ARE WAYS OF MINIMISING THE DAMAGE IN THESE DRINKS 
TRY AND ONLY DRINK HARMFUL DRINKS AT MEALTIMES TRY NOT TO KEEP SIPPING THEM 
TRY AND WAIT AN HOUR AFTER DRINKING TO GIVE THE SALIVA A CHANCE TO WASH AWAY THE DRINK 
BEFORE YOU BRUSH YOUR TEETH 
BUT THE BEST ADVICE OF ALL OF COURSE IS TO AVOID DRINKING HARMFUL DRINKS IN THE FIRST PLACE
