WISE GRANDMA OWL BLINKS HER BIG EYES 
SHE LOOKS AROUND 
WHOO HOO HOOTS WISE GRANDMA OWL 
SWEET DREAMS 
THAT WAS SUCH A NICE STORY 
I THOUGHT I'D MAKE A CAKE OF ONE OF THE ANIMALS 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A HEDGEHOG CAKE 
TO MAKE IT WE'LL NEED SOME ICING SUGAR 
SOME COCOA POWDER 
SOME WATER 
AND MARBLE CAKE 
IT'S CALLED MARBLE CAKE BECAUSE IT'S ALL SWIRLY AND TWIRLY 
WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOME MINT STICKS 
SOME CHOCOLATE SWEETS 
AND A TUBE OF ICING 
THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO 
IS TO MIX OUR ICING SUGAR AND COCOA POWDER TOGETHER 
I'M GOING TO POUR IT 
INTO THAT JUG 
YOU ONLY NEED A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER FOR THIS 
AND LET'S GIVE THAT A MIX 
OH LOOK AT THAT 
IT'S ALL MIXING TOGETHER VERY NICELY 
KEEP TURNING IT 
OH A BIT OF IT JUMPED OUT THEN 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED 
A LITTLE BIT MORE WATER IN THAT 
JUST A TOUCH 
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
OH LOOK AT THAT 
AND THAT MAKES A LOVELY 
LOVELY CHOCOLATY MIXTURE 
NOW WE NEED TO COVER OUR MARBLE CAKE WITH THIS 
IF YOU POUR IT 
ON THE TOP OF YOUR MARBLE CAKE 
IT SHOULD START TO OOZE DOWN FOR YOU 
THERE WE GO MAKE SURE WE USE IT ALL UP COS IT'S SO NICE 
AND I'LL SPREAD 
THAT ALL THE WAY AROUND 
OUR CAKE JUST TO MAKE SURE 
THAT WE COVER UP 
OUR LITTLE HEDGEHOG 
AND WE CAN SEE 
THAT THE ICING SUGAR 
AND THE COCOA MIXED UP 
HAS COVERED 
OUR LITTLE HEDGEHOG PERFECTLY 
NOW 
WE CAN START DECORATING OUR HEDGEHOG 
I'M GOING TO USE THESE MINT STICKS 
IF YOU BREAK THEM IN HALF 
AND THEN STICK THEM INTO YOUR HEDGEHOG CAKE 
AT AN ANGLE WHICH MEANS NOT STRAIGHT UP 
YOU CAN SEE ALREADY 
OUR HEDGEHOG IS STARTING TO LOOK PRETTY GOOD 
BREAK AWAY 
I'M TRYING HARD NOT TO NIBBLE THESE MINT STICKS THEY SMELL LOVELY 
BREAK THEM IN HALF AND COVER THE WHOLE OF THE CAKE 
THE BACK AND THE SIDES 
WITH YOUR MINT STICKS 
THERE WE GO 
ONE MORE I THINK 
AND ONE HERE THERE IT'S STARTING TO LOOK VERY GOOD 
OH ONE'S TUMBLED DOWN 
NOW TO DECORATE OUR HEDGEHOG FACE 
I'M GOING TO USE OUR CHOCOLATE SWEETS FOR THIS 
I THINK I'LL USE THESE WHITE ONES TO MAKE LITTLE HEDGEHOG EYES 
AND ONE OF THESE SHINY ONES 
TO MAKE A LITTLE HEDGEHOG NOSE 
AND WE'LL PUT SOME LITTLE FEET ON OUR HEDGEHOG 
TWO AT THE FRONT 
AND TWO AT THE BACK 
WITH OUR ICING SUGAR 
WE CAN PUT 
A LITTLE BLOB THERE 
A LITTLE BLOB THERE 
AND A NICE SMILEY 
HEDGEHOG 
FACE 
THERE 
WELL DOESN'T OUR HEDGEHOG LOOK HAPPY 
THERE'S THE WINDOWS 
MAYBE WE'LL SEE SOME MORE PRICKLY ANIMALS 
THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE 
SQUARE WINDOW 
HERE IS A HEDGEHOG 
HEDGEHOGS MOSTLY COME OUT AT NIGHT BECAUSE IT IS SAFER 
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF JUICY WORMS AND SNAILS TO EAT 
HEDGEHOGS ARE COVERED IN LOTS AND LOTS OF PRICKLES 
SO BIGGER ANIMALS WON'T HURT THEM 
HERE'S ANOTHER PRICKLY ANIMAL THAT COMES OUT AT NIGHT 
THIS IS A PORCUPINE 
IT LIVES IN A PLACE CALLED AFRICA 
WHERE THERE ARE LOTS OF BIG FIERCE ANIMALS LIKE HUNGRY HYENAS 
THIS MOTHER PORCUPINE HAS A LITTLE BABY 
SHE KEEPS IT CLOSE BY TO MAKE SURE IT IS SAFE 
THEIR SPINY PRICKLES STOP THEM FROM BEING EATEN BY ANIMALS LIKE HYENAS 
LOTS OF ANIMALS HAVE PRICKLES FOR PROTECTION 
THIS ANIMAL LIVES IN THE SEA 
IT'S A SPINY SEA URCHIN 
ITS LONG SPINES STOP BIG FISH FROM GETTING TOO CLOSE 
AND TRYING TO EAT IT UP 
THESE LION FISH HAVE LONG FINS 
WHICH ARE VERY SHARP AND POINTY 
AND STOP BIGGER FISH FROM EATING THEM 
THESE SPINY LOBSTERS ARE CRAWLING ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA 
IN A CHAIN TO KEEP THEM SAFE 
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY THEY HAVE LOTS OF SPIKES ON THEIR HEADS AND LEGS 
WHICH MAKE THEM FAR TOO PRICKLY FOR MOST ANIMALS TO EAT THEM 
BUT NOT JUST ANIMALS ARE PRICKLY AND SPIKY SOME PLANTS ARE TOO 
THESE PRICKLY PLANTS ARE CALLED CACTI 
JUST LOOK AT THIS CACTUS ALL COVERED IN SPINES 
CACTI LIVE IN PLACES LIKE DESERTS 
WHERE THERE ISN'T MUCH TO EAT OR DRINK 
A NICE JUICY CACTUS WOULD MAKE A LOVELY MEAL 
BUT NOT EVEN A CATERPILLAR CAN GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO HAVE A BITE 
BECAUSE OF THOSE NASTY PRICKLES 
PRICKLES AND SPIKES ARE GREAT FOR PROTECTION 
WHETHER YOU'RE AN ANIMAL ON THE LAND 
OR IN THE WATER 
OR EVEN IF YOU'RE A PLANT 
YEAH THAT FEELS NICE AND PRICKLY

LOOK THAT'S THE RUBBISH THAT JOHN AND GRACIE PUT OUT 
ONCE THE DUSTBIN LORRY IS FULL IT'S TAKEN TO ANOTHER SITE 
WHERE THE LORRY IS EMPTIED INTO HUGE CONTAINERS 
THESE CONTAINERS ARE THEN LOADED ONTO A TRAIN 
READY TO BE TAKEN TO A PLACE WHERE THEY DUMP THE RUBBISH 
THIS IS CALLED A LANDFILL SITE 
WHEN THE CONTAINERS ARRIVE THEY'RE LOADED OFF THE TRAIN ONTO LORRIES 
WHICH TAKE THEM TO THE LANDFILL 
ALL DAY LONG THE LORRIES GO BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS 
FROM THE CRANE TO THE LANDFILL EMPTYING OUT ALL THE RUBBISH 
ALL THE SMELLS OR GASES ARE SUCKED DOWN THIS PIPE 
AND ALONG THESE PIPES INTO A MACHINE CALLED A TURBINE 
WHERE THEY'RE TURNED INTO ELECTRICITY SO YOU CAN WATCH TELLY
