SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH WAS FOUND GUILTY 
OF MURDERING TWO YEAR OLD KYLE 
FISHER BY SMASHING HIS HEAD AGAINST 
A BANNISTER AND WAS SENTENCED TO 
LIFE IN JAIL BUT TODAY SHE'S WON 
RETRIAL AND IS FREE UNTIL THAT 
HAPPENS THE JUDGE AT THE COURT OF 
APPEAL RULED THAT NEW EVIDENCE MADE 
HER CONVICTION UNSAFE SOPHIE 
HUTCHINSON WAS IN COURT SUZANNE 
HOLDSWORTH WAS KEEN TO STAY OUT OF 
THE PUBLIC GAZE THIS EVENING AS SHE 
WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON HER 
CONVICTION FOR THE MURDER OF KYLE 
FISHER HAS BEEN QUASHED AND A 
RETRIAL ORDERED 
I DON'T THINK SHE 
HAD ANY WORDS WHEN WE FIRST TOLD 
HER SHE WAS SO OVERWHELMED WITH 
EMOTION SHE WAS CRYING BUT SHE 
SAID SHE WAS VERY HAPPY VERY 
RELIEVED 
AND THIS IS THE LITTLE RELIEVED BOY AT THE CENTRE OF THE CASE THE 
ORIGINAL TRIAL HEARD THAT KYLE 
FISHER HAD SUFFERED MASSIVE HEAD 
INJURIES INFLICTED BY SUZANNE 
HOLDSWORTH AS SHE BABY SAT HIM AT 
HER HOUSE IN HARTLEPOOL BY 
REPEATEDLY RAMMING HIS HEAD AGAINST 
WOODEN BANNISTERS BUT AT THE 
APPEAL HER LAWYERS ARGUED HIS DEATH 
MAY HAVE HAD NATURAL CAUSES THEY 
CHALLENGED THE ASSUMPTION THAT HE 
WAS A HEALTHY BOY THEY EXPLAINED A 
PREVIOUS INJURY HAD LEFT HIM WITH A 
DROOPING EYE HE HAD BRAIN 
ABNORMALITIES AND MAY HAVE HAD A 
PROLONGED EP SEPTIC SEIZURE THEY 
SUGGESTED A COMPLEX COMBINATION OF 
MEDICAL PROBLEMS YESTERDAY TO BE 
FULLY UNDERSTOOD MAY HAVE KILLED 
HIM THE JUDGES SAID 
FISH BUT KYLE FISHER'S GRANDMOTHER 
IS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RULING AND 
SAID SHE WANTS THE TRUTH TO BE 
KNOWN THIS IS THE LATEST IN A 
NUMBER OF CASES INVOLVING THE 
DEATHS OF CHILDREN IN WHICH MEDICAL 
EVIDENCE HAS PROVED FUNDAMENTAL 
THAT EVIDENCE IS EXPECTED TO GO 
BEFORE A JURY IN THE AUTUMN 
DID JOSEF FRITZL CARRY OUT HIS 
SHOCKING CRIMES ALONE AUSTRIAN 
POLICE SAY THE SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD ENGINEER 
HAD NO ACCOMPLICES IN RAPING HIS 
DAUGHTER AND LOCKING HER IN A 
DUNGEON FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS BUT NOW A 
LODGER WHO LIVED IN THE HOUSE IN 
AMSTETTEN HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. HE SAW 
ANOTHER MAN ENTER THE CELLAR FROM 
AMSTETTEN STEVE ROSENBERG REPORTS 
HE HAD LOCKED UP HIS OWN DAUGHTER 
IN LAW HIS CELLAR BUT JOSEF FRITZL 
WAS SO CONFIDENT HIS SECRET HAD 
BEEN BURIED UNDERGROUND THAT UP 
STAIRS HE TOOK IN LODGERS FOR TWELVE 
YEARS ALFRED DIVANOVSKY RENTED A 
ROOM IN FRITZL'S HOUSE 
HE WAS SUCH A STRANGE GUY NONE OF THE LODGERS WERE 
SPWHRUED THE CELLAR OR TAKE 
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE GARDEN AREA HE 
SAID THE CELLAR WAS HIS PRIVATE 
AREA AND HE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE FROM 
ONLY HE ALONE WAS ALLOWED TO GO 
INTO THE CELLAR HE WENT THERE 
ALMOST EVERY DAY L. THOUGHT IT WAS 
STRANGE BUT NOT SUSPICIOUS 
DID YOU 
EVER SEE ANYONE ELSE GOING DOWN TO 
THE CELLAR 
HE DIDN'T GET MANY 
VISITORS SOMETIMES RELATIVES OR 
FRIENDS WOULD COME TO THE HOUSE 
BUT ONE TIME FRITZL INTRODUCED ME 
TO SOMEONE ELSE HE SAID HE WAS A 
PLUMBER AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO 
DOWN INTO THE CELLAR 
IN THE TWELVE 
YEARS YOU LIVED AT THE HOUSE DID 
YOU NOTICE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS I I HEARD NOISES BELOW MY ROOM KIND OF 
BANGING BASHING KNOCKING NOISES 
ONCE I ASKED FRITZL WHAT IT WAS HE 
TOLD ME IT WAS COMING FROM THE GAS 
HEATING BELOW ONE OF THE OTHER 
LODGERS SAID SHE SAW HIM TAKING 
FOOD INTO 
THE CELLAR 
AT NIGHT THE 
I DIDN'T SEE THAT BUT ASSUMED HE 
WAS STORYING FOOD DOWN THERE 
ALFRED DIVANOVSKY HAD ONENING IN 
COMMON WITH JOSEF FRITZL HE TOO 
HAD BEEN ON HOLIDAY TO THAILAND IT 
GAVE LODGER AND LANDLORD SOMETHING 
TO CHAT ABOUT 
AFTER I 
CAME BACK FROM HOLIDAY WE TALKED 
ABOUT EVERYTHING L. TOLD HIM HOW 
EASY IT WAS TO GET DRUG THIS IS 
THAILAND HE REPLY WE MUST 
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN THAT'S WHY WE 
HAVE TO LOCK THEM AWAY ALFRED ALFRED DIVANOVSKY MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE 
LAST YEAR BUT ONE PHRASE FROM 
FRITZL HAS STUCK IN HIS MINDS HE 
SAID FRITZL BOASTED HIS HOUSE WOULD 
GO DOWN IN HISTORY 
LOCAL PRODUCE IS BECOMING MORE AND 
MORE OF A SELLING POINT IN PUBS AND 
RESTAURANTS AROUND BRITAIN MANY 
CLAIM TO OFFER BRITISH BEEF SOURCED 
IN THE REGION BUT AN INVESTIGATION 
FOR B. B. C. NEWS HAS DISCOVERED THAT IN 
SOME CASES THE BEEF WASN'T LOCAL 
AND IT WASN'T EVEN BRITISH OUR 
CORRESPONDENT JON KAY CHECKED 
BEEF FROM FORTY PUBS AND RESTAURANTS 
ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
ONE IN FIVE OF THE DISHES FAILED 
THE TEST CELEBRATING THE VERY BEST 
OF LOCAL FOOD AT THIS FESTIVAL IN 
EXETER SHOPPERS CAN BUY DIRECTS 
FROM THE FARMER HERE THEY KNOW 
EXACTLY WHERE THE PRODUCE HAS COME 
FROM BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN THEY ARE 
EATING OUT IF YOU WERE TO BUY 
SOMETHING DESCRIBED AS A LOCAL 
STEAK IN A PUB OR RESTAURANT 
HOWEVER WOULD YOU HAVE EXPECTED 
THAT MEAT TO TRAVELLED 
TWENTY OR THIRTY 
MILES 
TEN MILES IF I'M LUCKY FIVE MILES FIVE MILES 
ESPECIALLY IN DEVON THERE MILES ARE SO MANY FARMS 
WE WENT UNDER 
COVER AND VISITED FORTY DIFFERENT PUB 
IT IS AND RESTAURANTS ACROSS THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND ALL OF THEM 
CLAIM TO GO SELL LOCAL BEEF WE 
TOOK A SAMPLE IN EACH ONE BAGGED 
ITS AND SENT IT OFF FOR SCIENTIFIC 
ANALYSIS AT THIS LABORATORY IN 
DUBLIN THEY TESTED EVERY PIECE OF 
MEAT THEY LOOKED AT THE D. N. A. OF 
EACH SAMPLE TO ESTABLISH WHAT 
SPECIES OF CATLE THE BEEF CAME FROM 
THEY FOUND THAT EIGHT OUT OF FORTY OF OUR 
SAMPLES CAME FROM SPECIES THAT ONLY 
EXIST FROM ABROAD SO TWENTY PER CENT OF OUR 
SUPPOSEDLY LOCAL STEAKS AND BURGERS 
WERE IN FACT FOREIGN 
THE MEAT MAY 
WELL HAVE ORIGINATED IN BRAZIL OR 
BOTSWANA 
SO WE ARE TALKING MANY BOTSWANA THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY 
IT IS 
CERTAINLY NOT LOCAL 
IN A FILTH OF 
OUR RESTAURANTS WHEN WE THOUGHT WE 
WERE BUYING BRITISH BEEF FIFTH 
OF OUR RESTAURANTS WHEN WE THOUGHT 
WE WERE BUYING BRITISH BEEF WE WERE 
EATING ZEBU CATTLE THAT ONLY LIVE 
IN DRY ARID PARTS OF THE WORLD IT IT IS OUTRAGEOUS 
THAT'S ALMOST 
TANTAMOUNT TO FRAUD REALLY ISN'T 
IT 
IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY A IT RESTAURANT MIGHT BE TIMENTED THEY 
CAN BUY FOREIGN MEAT CHEAPLY AND 
SELL IT ON AT A PREMIUM AS LOCAL 
BRITISH BEEF AND MOST OF US 
WOULDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE 
THESE HAVE BEEN BORN RAISED AND 
REARED ON THIS FARM 
BUT FARMER S. 
LIKE JILLY SAY THERE IS A REAL 
DIFFERENCE NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY 
ARE LOSING OUT ON LOCAL BUSINESS 
BUT THEY CLAIM SOME IMPORTED MEAT 
IS POOR QUALITY AND COMES FROM 
AREAS OF THE WORLD WITH LOWER 
STANDARDS OF ANIMAL WELFARE AND MY 
JEEFPBLT 
AT GREAT BIG CON PURE JEEFPBLT EXPLOITATION OF CONSUMER DEMAND FOR 
LOCALLY PRODUCED FOOD UNTIL THERE 
IS A PROPERLY AUDITED TRAIL THE 
SITUATION IS ONLY GET TO GET WORSE 
THE LAW SAYS BUTCHERS MUST BE ABLE 
TO PROVE EXACTLY WHERE MEAT HAS 
COME FROM FARMERS SAY RESTAURANTS 
SHOULD HAVE TO DO THE SAME AT THE 
MOMENT THERE'S A LEGAL LOOPHOLE 
WHICH COULD EXPLAIN WHY SO MANY OF 
OUR SAMPLES TURNED OUT TO BE 
FOREIGN TAKE THIS STEAK PIE THE 
MEAT INSIDE HERE ACTUALLY CAME FROM 
BRAZIL SIX THOUSAND MILES AWAY BUT 
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN PROCESSED IN THIS 
COUNTRY IT CAN LEGALLY BE DESCRIBED 
ON A RESTAURANT MEAN YEW AS A 
BRITISH OR EVEN LOCAL PRODUCT 
BEFORE WE BEGAN IN INVESTIGATION 
THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WASN'T AWARE 
OF A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM VERY FEW 
BUSINESSS HAVE EVER BEEN PROSECUTED 
BUT TONIGHT THE GOVERNMENT'S FOOD 
WATCHDOG SAID IT IS DISAPPOINTED 
WITH OUR FINDINGS AND SAYS THE LAW 
NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED 
I THINK THE 
LABELLING REGULATIONS ARE 
COMPLICATED ESPECIALLY FOR 
PREPACKED PREPREPARED FOOD AND 
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE CAN 
PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO 
CONSUMERS TO HELP THEM MAKE THE 
CHOICES THEY WANT TO TRADING TRADING STANDARDS SAYS THERE NEEDS TO BE A 
NEW LEGAL DEFINITION OF WHAT 
LOCAL REALLY MEANS ALTHOUGH OUR 
INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT IN 
THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND THEY SAID 
THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE SITUATION 
HERE IS UNIQUE 
VOTING IS UNDER WAY FOR THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES THE 
POLLS OPENED AT SEVEN HUNDRED A M. AND CLOSE AT 
TEN ZERO ZERO P. M. THERE ARE SOME FOUR THOUSAND 
COUNCIL SEATS UP FOR GRABS AND 
VOTERS IN LONDON ARE CHOOSING THE 
CITY'S MAYOR AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF 
THE LONDON ASSEMBLY YOU CAN GET 
ALL THE ELECTION RESULTS AS THEY 
COME IN TONIGHT ON 
ALL THE ELECTION RESULTS AS THEY COME IN TONIGHT ON 
T. V. RADIO AND 
COME IN TONIGHT ON T. V. RADIO AND ON LINE 
THEY CARRY FIFTY THOUSAND VOLTS AND ARE 
SEEN BY MANY POLICE MEN AND WOMEN 
AS A VITAL CRIME FIGHTING TOOL 
TASERS HAVE BEEN USED IN BRITAIN 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR BUT ONLY BY SPECIALLY 
TRAINED FIREARMS OFFICERS NOW 
THERE ARE PLANS TO GIVE THEM TO 
MANY MORE OFFICERS WHO'LL RECEIVE 
JUST TWO DAYS' TRAINING RORY 
MACLEAN HAS THIS EXCLUSIVE REPORT 
AN EARLY KNOCK ON THE DOOR BY THE 
POLICE ALWAYS CARRIES AN ELEMENT OF 
SHOCK POLICE 
THIS ONE REALLY DOES SHOCK POLICE PLACE YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD THEY THEY ARE AFTER AN ALLEGED VIOLENT ROBBER 
STAND AND FACE ME LOOK AT THE DOTS 
ON YOUR CHOICE THIS IS A TASER FIFTY 
STHOU VOLTS IT WILL BE USED 
AGAINST YOU IF YOU DO NOT COMPLY 
UNTIL RECENTLY SPECIALLY TRAINED 
FIREARMS OFFICERS USED TASERS NOW 
OTHERS ARE BEING ISSUED WITH THEM 
THEY ARE BEING USED BY THE 
TERRITORIAL SUPPORT GROUP POLICE 
OFFICERS SAY THEY LIKE THEM BECAUSE 
THEY ALLOW THEM TO CONTROL THE 
SITUATION FROM A DISTANCE THAT 
RAID TOOK LESS THAN TWO MINUTES 
IT'S ONE OF MANY SUCH CASES 
AS THEY TRAIN FOR TASERURE THE 
POLICE HERE ARE VERY AWARE THAT 
ANYTHING SIMILAR WOULD HAVE SERIOUS 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WIDER TRIALS 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IS TASER I I DON'T WANT NONE OF THAT ARE YOU 
GOING TO SHOOT ME 
IT'S A 
TECHNOLOGY THEY SAY DOESN'T HAVE TO 
BE USED TO BE EFFECTIVE 
MORE OFTEN 
THAN NOT THE MERE DRAWING OF THE 
WEAPON THE TASER OR POINTING A 
RED DOT AT SOMEBODY IS SUFFICIENT 
TO DEFUSE SITUATIONS ALL OF THOSE 
SITUATIONS ARE SITUATIONS WHERE THE 
INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES OR THE 
PUBLIC WOULD HAVE BEEN SEVERELY 
INJURED IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TASER WE WE DO HAVE CONCERN ABOUT TASER 
ENTERING WIDESPREAD MAINSTREAM 
POLICE ESPECIALLY ON THE BASIS OF 
ONLY TWO OR THREE DAYS' TRAINING 
DURING TRAINING OFFICERS SIMULATE 
BEING SHOT TASER IS CERTAIN TO 
BECOME MORE GENERALLY USED BY 
POLICE OFFICERS TO RETAIN WHAT 
THEY REGARD AS USEFUL TACTIC THE 
POLICE KNOW THEY HAVE TO 
DEMONSTRATE AN ABILITY NOT TO REACH 
FOR IT TOO QUICKLY 
THE TIME IS SIX SIXTEEN P. M. 
C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE OF THE AFTERMATH OF 
THE JULY SEVENTH BOMBINGS IN LONDON HAS 
BEEN RELEASED FOR THE FIRST TIME 
ON B. B. C. LONDON SUFFERING THE 
EFFECTS OF ATOMIC TESTS IN THE 
PACIFIC THE NUMBER OF VETERANS 
CAMPAIGNING FOR COMPENSATION 
REACHES A THOUSAND 
WHY THE THAMES ORIENTAL CRABS COULD 
BE RETURNING HOME TO CHINA'S 
RESTAURANTS 
WE'LL NEVER GIVE UP ON MADELEINE 
THAT WAS KATE MCCANN'S MESSAGE 
TODAY NEARLY ONE YEAR AFTER HER 
DAUGHTER WENT MISSING IN THE 
ALGARVE BOTH MADELEINE'S PARENTS 
SAY THEY BELIEVE SHE CAN STILL BE 
FOUND ALIVE AND THEY'RE CAMPAIGNING 
FOR AN EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM FOR 
MISSING CHILDREN THEY'VE BEEN 
MISSING TO THE B. B. C.'S HUGH EDWARDS 
HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THE HOPE YOU 
MIGHT FIND HER ALIVE AND WHAT KEEPS 
THAT HOPE IN PLACE 
NUMBER ONE MADELEINE IS SO 
IMPORTANT TO US AND TO SEAN AND 
AMELIE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO 
EVIDENCE THAT ANY HARM HAS COME TO 
HER THREE IF YOU LOOK AT FOR 
EXAMPLE THE STATES WHERE THEY HAVE 
A LOT OF STATISTICS RELATING TO 
THIS KIND OF CRIME CHILDREN ARE 
RECOVERED YOU KNOW A LOT OF 
CHILDREN ARE RECOVERED THE YOUNGER 
THE CHILD THE BETTER THE CHANCE OF 
THAT 
THEY WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT THAT ONE OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AIMS NOW IS 
TO PROMOTE A EUROPE WIDE ALERT 
SCHEME FOR MISSING CHILDREN 
EVEN DURING THE NIGHT WE WERE 
SAYING HAD THE BORDERS BEEN ALERT 
AND PORLTS AND VARIOUS THINGS 
YOUR WORRY IS THAT CHILD MIGHT BE 
MOVED QUICKLY FAR AWAY AWAY FROM 
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME SO CLEARLY 
THE IDEA OF AN EMERGENCY ALERT 
SYSTEM IS THERE WE STARTED 
RESEARCHING AND HEARD ABOUT THE 
AMBER ALERT IN THE U. S. AND HOW 
EFFECTIVE IT'S BEEN REALLY THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE 
CHILDREN HAVE BEEN RECOVERED AS A 
DIRECT RESULT OF THAT ALERT SYSTEM 
KATE AND GERRY MCCANN ARE STILL 
OFFICIAL SUSPECTS AND YET THEY SAY 
THAT THEIR CONTACT WITH THE 
PORTUGUESE POLICE IS ALMOST NON 
EXISTENT 
WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE EXISTENT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAS BEEN DONE 
WHAT HASN'T BEEN DONE WHO HAS BEEN 
ELIMINATED AND ON WHAT GROUNDS 
THIS IS CRIME IT'S A HORRIFIC 
CRIME AGAINST A YOUNG CHILD 
THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT 
MADELEINE IS STILL MISSING AND 
HIDEOUS CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED 
THAT PERSON IS STILL OUT THERE 
WHAT IS THE MESSAGE YOU ARE GIVING 
ON THIS FIRST ANNIVERSARY THE THE MESSAGE IS THAT MADELEINE IS STILL 
MISSING AND SHE NEEDS TO BE FOUND 
WE ARE URGING PEOPLE TO HELP US 
STILL I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE HELPED US 
FROM DAY ONE WE STILL NEED THAT 
HELP MADELEINE STILL NEEDS THAT 
HELP WE NEED TOO KEY BIT OF 
INFORMATION 
WHAT THE MCCANNS HOPE INFORMATION IS THAT THE INTENSE MEDIA PRESSURE 
ON THEM WILL SUBSIDE AFTER 
SATURDAY'S ANNIVERSARY ALLOWING 
THEM TO FOCUS ONCE AGAIN ON THE 
ONLY THING THAT MATTERS 
WE WILL 
NEVER GIVE UP ON MADELEINE L. WANT 
MADELEINE BACK WE NEED TO FIND 
MADELEINE THAT IS WHAT KEEPS US 
GOING GOING KATE AND GERRY MCCANN 
THE FIGHT AGAINST HEART DISEASE HAS 
BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT MEDICALS 
ADVANCE OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS NOW 
THERE IS EVIDENCE WHEN IT COMES TO 
WOMEN UNDER FIFTY THAT SUCCESS IS 
STALLING THE DEATH RATE MIGHT EVEN 
INCREASE RESEARCHERS BELIEVE THE 
HIGHER INCIDENTS OF OBESITY AND 
DIABETES IN SOME WOMEN COULD BE TO 
BLAME CATHERINE MARSTON HAS THE 
DETAILS DETAILS HOLD YOUR BREATH THERE 
LOOKING FOR 
SIGNS OF HEART DISEASE THE PATIENT 
BEING INVESTIGATED IS FEMALE AND 
JUST FORTY FIVE IN THIS SPECIALIST UNIT AT 
THE NORTHERN GENERAL HOSPITAL IN 
SHEFFIELD THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND 
OUT IF HEART DISEASE IS CAUSING HER 
SERIOUS CHEST PAIN THIS LADY HAS 
THREE KEY FACTORS WHICH PUT HER AT 
MUCH GREATER RISK OF GETTING HEART 
DISEASE DIABETES HIGH CHOLESTEROL 
AND SHE HAS ALSO BEEN AROUND HEAVY 
SMOKERS ALL HER LIFE EVEN SO SHE 
IS SURPRISED SHE COULD HAVE HEART 
DISEASE SO YOUNG 
I 
DON'T DRINK L. DON'T SMOKE L. WALK I'M FIT MY 
DIET IS PROBABLY NOT GOOD BUT I'M 
NORMALLY GENERALLY VERY FIT 
IT'S A 
BIG SURPRISE ISN'T IT TO BE HERE 
IF IT COULD HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY WHO 
DOESN'T SMOKE I HAVE NEVER SMOKED 
IN MY LIFE 
WE HAVE A LAST PICTURE 
TO DO WHICH INVOLVES INJECTING DYE 
INTO THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE HEART 
THIS PROCEDURE OF PUMPING DYE INTO 
THE HEART HELPS IDENTIFY BLOCKAGES 
WHICH COULD KILL TODAY'S REPORT 
SAYS WHILE DEATHS FROM HEART 
DISEASE IN MOST AGE GROUPS ARE 
FALLING IN WOMEN UNDER FIFTY THE 
FIGURES HAVE LEVELLED AND MAY EVEN 
GO UP HERE IN SHEFFIELD THEY'RE 
CERTAINLY SEEING YOUNGER AND 
YOUNGER PEOPLE PRESENTING WITH THE 
DISEASE DISEASE I'M WORRIED BECAUSE THIS 
GENERATION OF YOUNGER MEN AND WOMEN 
WILL HAVE MORE AND MORE PROBLEMS IN 
THE FUTURE THAT PROBLEM WILL 
MAGNIFY ITSELF AS THIS GROUP OF 
PATIENTS GET OLDER 
PATIENTS GET OLDER 
IT'S NOT DOING 
PATIENTS GET OLDER IT'S NOT DOING ENOUGH OF THIS ALONG WITH DIABETES 
AND OBESITY WHICH IS CAUSING 
PROBLEMS FOR WOMEN UNDER FIFTY YET 
THE NUMBERS OF DEATHS FROM HEART 
DISEASE SINCE THE SEVENTIES ARE 
FALLING ELSEWHERE IN THE FIFTY FIVE TO FIFTY NINE 
AGE GROUP OF MEN THE FIGURES ARE 
DOWN BY TWO THIRDS IT'S SIMILAR IN 
WOMEN OF THAT AGE RESEARCHERS WARN 
IF THE TREND IS NOT REVERSED IN 
YOUNGER WOMEN HEART DISEASE COULD 
BECOME EVEN GREATER BURDEN ON THE 
N. H. S. N. H. S. THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS URGED BANKS

MANY ARE SMOTHERED WITH MILLIONS OF 
BACTERIA MESSAGE TO IRES IS CLEAN 
YOUR COMPUTER LUISA BALDINI 
REPORTS REPORTS WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME AT OUR 
COMPUTERS AND EATING LUNCH OVER A 
KEYBOARD IS JUST ONE WAY OF 
BREEDING GERMS A NEW STUDY BY 
WHICH XUEPTER REVEALED THAT ONE 
KEYBOARD TESTED HARBOURED FIVE 
TIMES MORE HARMFUL BACTERIA THAN A 
TOILET SEAT SO WHAT HORRORS MAY 
LURK BENEATH YOUR KEYBOARD THE 
SURVEY FOUND STAFF STAFF STAFF 
WHICH CAN CAUSE BLOOD INFECTIONS 
E. COLI THAT CAN CAUSE DIARRHOEA AND 
COLI FORMS COLI FORMS IF WE WANT TO SEE THE BACTERIA I 
WILL TURN THE LIGHTS OFF WE WILL 
TAKE AN ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT AND SHINE 
IT ON THE KEY BOARD YOU CAN SEE 
THERE THE BACTERIA AND GREASE 
LIGHTING UP IF YOU KNEES OR BLOW 
YOUR NOSE YOU WILL PUT VIRUSES ON 
THERE WHICH CAN SPREAD COLDS AND 
EVEN WORSE IF YOU GO TO THE TOILET 
AND DON'T WASH YOUR HANDS 
AFTERWARDS YOU PUT COLIFORMS ON 
THERE ALL OF THESE CAN CAUSE

I'M NOT

GROSS 
I'M AT MY DESK PROBABLY MORE GROSS THAN I'M AT HOME YOU ARE DRINKING

TO PREVENT YOUR

WIPE THE KEYS WITH A DAMPENED CLOTH

IN CONTRAST TO THE LAST FEW DAYS A 
LOT DRIER AND BRIGHTER 
IN SOME AREAS THIS IS NOT TOO GOOD 
TO BE TRUE IT LOOKS LIKE TOMORROW 
WILL BE A QUIETER DAY SO THE 
SHOWERS WILL BE FEWER AND FAR 
BETWEEN THE SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
LONGER WE WILL SEE SOME SHOWERS 
DEVELOPING AS THE DAY GOES BY 
NORTHERN SCOTLAND COULD SEE SOME OF 
THE HEAVIEST OF THOSE PERHAPS WITH 
THE ODD RUMBLE OF THUNDER EVEN 
HERE LESS SHOWERS THAN WE HAVE 
SEEN TODAY SO MORE IN THE WAY OF
