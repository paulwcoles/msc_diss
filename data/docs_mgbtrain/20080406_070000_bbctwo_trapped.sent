AND THERE IS TIA SHE WALKS BACKWARDS ON A TUESDAY 
I ONLY CAME TO THE TOWER FOR A NIGHT'S KIP HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO 
BUT I HAVE BEEN TRAPPED HERE EVER SINCE 
THE VOICE CAUGHT ME SHE IS A CRUEL MISTRESS 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER 
BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS HEAR HER TALKING IN YOUR NOISE HOLE 
SHE HAS PROMISED TO LET ME GO ONLY IF I HELP HER TRAP

FROM HERE I GETS TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON IN THE TOWER 
SIX UNFORTUNATES STARTS HERE AT THE TOP AND WORKS THEIR WAY DOWNWARDS 
IF THEY MAKES IT OUT THE BOTTOM 
THEY ARE HOME IN TIME FOR TEA AND A NICE WORMY ROLL 
BUT IT IS NOT THAT EASY 
TO ESCAPE EACH FLOOR THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE A CHALLENGE TOGETHER 
BUT ONE OF THEM CANNOT BE TRUSTED THE SABOTEUR 
THE SABOTEUR'S JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THEY ALL FAIL THE CHALLENGE 
THE VOICE CHOOSES A NEW SABOTEUR ON EACH FLOOR 
YOU ARE THE SABOTEUR 
AND SHE TALKS TO THEM SECRETLY USING THE WHISPER CLIP 
A CUNNING LITTLE DEVICE THAT GOES RIGHT INSIDE THEIR NOISE HOLE 
WHICH MEANS THAT SHE CAN BE 
MURMURING HELPFUL STINKY LITTLE TIPS TO THEM WITHOUT THE OTHERS HEARING 
IF THE TEAM SUCCEED THE SABOTEUR WILL BE TRAPPED ON THAT FLOOR 
IF THE TEAM FAIL IT COULD BE ANY ONE OF THEM 
IN THE END ONLY ONE WILL ESCAPE

FROM A PILE OF PRESENTS

LOOKS LIKE THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN SABOTAGED 
BUT HAS THE SABOTEUR BEEN SEEN 
YOU MUST NOW VOTE FOR WHO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR IS 
MONTELL WHO DO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS AND WHY 
I THINK IT WAS NIKICA BECAUSE THE LAST BOX IT WAS A FART 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS HIM ROCHELLE 
I THINK IT WAS FRANKIE BECAUSE SHE WAS ALWAYS ALWAYS TELLING US 
TO GO AND I THOUGHT IT WAS HER 
AIMEN I THINK IT WAS MONTELL BECAUSE WE LISTENED TO HIM 
AND THE FIRST TWO WERE FARTS FRANKIE 
MONTELL BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE WENT WITH HIS CHOICE NIKICA 
I THINK IT WAS MONTELL 
BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS POINTING OUT WHICH BOX WE SHOULD TAKE 
TIA WHO DO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS 
I THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS FRANKIE BECAUSE WHEN SHE WENT UP 
SHE HESITATED AND HAD A FUNNY LOOK ON HER FACE 
YOU HAVE VOTED FOR MONTELL 
THE SABOTEUR WAS IN FACT 
MONTELL 
MONTELL YOU WILL NOT BE LEAVING THIS ROOM 
THE SABOTEUR HAS BEEN TRAPPED 
THE OTHERS ARE FREE TO PASS TO THE NEXT FLOOR 
MONTELL WHY DO YOU THINK THE OTHERS VOTED FOR YOU

SHOUTING AT ALL OF THEM TO TAKE IT BUT THEY NEVER FELL FOR IT 
POOR UNFORTUNATE MONTELL

HE MAY HAVE FAILED BUT HE DIDN'T GET AWAY WITH IT 
FLOOR FIVE FREAKY FACTORY 
FREAKY FACTORY IS ONE REALLY MEAN MACHINE AND I MEAN MEAN 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
THIS IS FREAKY FACTORY 
AS A TEAM THE UNFORTUNATES MUST FILL 
THE EGG BOXES ON THE CONVEYOR BELT WITH MATCHING COLORED VULTURE EGGS 
WHICH THEY WILL FIND AT THE BACK OF EACH BOOTH TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE 
THE CHALLENGE THEY MUST CORRECTLY FILL FIVE OF THE COLORED BOXES 
THEY ONLY HAVE NINETY SECONDS TO DO IT BUT BEWARE 
THE SABOTEUR WILL BE WORKING AGAINST THEM 
REMEMBER 
ONE OF THEM CAN'T BE TRUSTED BUT WHO IS IT 
NIKICA DO NOT REACT YOU ARE THE SABOTEUR 
IT IS YOUR JOB TO ENSURE THE TEAM FAIL THIS CHALLENGE 
YOU CAN DO THIS BY STOPPING THE OTHERS FROM FILLING THE BOXES 
YOU CAN SMASH OR STEAL EGGS IF YOU LIKE ANYTHING TO STOP THEM 
NIKICA IS THE NEXT SABOTEUR 
THE VOICE IN HIS WHISPER CLIP WILL HELP HIM WITH STINKY TIPS 
SO HE CAN SABOTAGE THE NEXT CHALLENGE 
UNFORTUNATES THIS CHALLENGE IS FREAKY FACTORY 
TO PASS YOU MUST CORRECTLY FILL FIVE EGG BOXES 
YOU HAVE NINETY SECONDS IN WHICH TO DO IT 
LET THE CHALLENGE BEGIN NOW 
O. K. NIKICA YOU HAVE TO STOP YOUR TEAM FROM COMPLETING THE BOXES' 
YES THAT'S IT SMASH THE EGGS 
MIXING UP THE COLOURS THAT IS GREAT 
CAREFUL NIKICA ONE BOX COMPLETE 
WHY NOT THROW THE EGGS IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S BOOTH 
THAT'S IT THE OTHERS ARE WORKING HARD 
REMEMBER YOUR TEAM MUST FAIL BUT YOU HAVE TO GET AWAY WITH IT 
SIXTY SECONDS TWO BOXES COMPLETED 
THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU THROW THE EGGS YOU HAVE FRANKIE ONE SIDE 
AND TIA ON THE OTHER 
THEY ARE BOUND TO BE SUSPICIOUS 
THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU FRAME ONE OF THEM 
TIME IS RUNNING OUT AND THEY STILL ONLY HAVE TWO BOXES COMPLETED 
IF ONLY YOU COULD GET RID OF SOME OF THOSE EGG BOXES' 
THIRTY SECONDS 
THREE BOXES COMPLETED 
GOOD NEWS TIA HAS COMPLETELY RUN OUT OF EGGS 
FOUR BOXES COMPLETED 
OH NO THEY HAVE FOUR BOXES THEY ONLY NEED ONE MORE 
DO WHATEVER YOU CAN SEVEN SIX 
FIVE FOUR THREE KEEP GOING YOU CAN DO IT YES 
YOUR TIME IS UP 
YOU HAVE FAILED MISERABLY 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SABOTEUR HAS DONE IT BUT WERE THEY SPOTTED 
YOU MUST NOW VOTE FOR WHO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR IS 
NIKICA WHO DO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS 
FRANKIE BECAUSE SHE THREW SO MANY BOXES IN FRONT OF MINE 
AND ALSO IN FRONT OF TIA 
TIA 
I ALSO THINK THE SABOTEUR IS FRANKIE 
BECAUSE I SAW EGGS COMING FROM HER SIDE 
ROCHELLE 
I THINK IT WAS AIMEN BECAUSE EVERY TIME I WENT TO PUT AN EGG IN 
HE KIND OF TOOK ONE FROM MINE AND CRACKED IT 
AIMEN 
I THINK IT WAS TIA 
BECAUSE ALL THE EGGS WERE GOING FROM THAT DIRECTION 
FRANKIE I THINK IT WAS TIA TOO 
BECAUSE I KEPT ON SEEING EGGS BEING THROWN FROM THAT SIDE TO THERE 
YOU VOTED FOR TIA AND FRANKIE 
AH IT'S A DRAW WHAT TO DO 
GET OUT THE DRAW STRAWS 
WHOEVER DRAWS THE SHORT STRAW WILL BE TRAPPED

AND WILL THEREFORE BE THE UNLUCKY ONE

NIKICA 
FRANKIE YOU WILL NOT BE LEAVING THIS ROOM 
THE OTHERS ARE FREE TO PASS TO THE NEXT FLOOR 
CRUMBLE BODS 
FRANKIE WHY DO YOU THINK THE OTHERS VOTED FOR YOU 
IT'S BECAUSE 
NIKICA WAS REALLY GOOD 
I WAS REALLY CLOSE TO HIM AND EVERYONE COULD SEE THAT 
I COULD'VE ACTUALLY DONE IT BUT I DIDN'T 
POOR UNFORTUNATE FRANKIE 
YOU'RE TRAPPED 
POOR OLD FRANKIE WRONGLY TRAPPED 
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER BIT CLOSER TO FREEDOM FOR ME 
FLOOR FOUR SNAKE ATTACK 
MAKE SURE THE SNAKE IS NICE AND HUNGRY 
SOME PEOPLE SAY SNAKE ATTACK IS SCARY 
BUT I THINK IT'S SSSIMPLY HILARIOUSSS 
A STRANGE WALL FACES THE UNFORTUNATES 
ONE OF THEM MUST MAKE IT SAFELY 
FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER CHOOSING WHICH HOLES TO PUT THEIR HANDS IN 
THEY MUST CHOOSE WISELY 
BECAUSE THE WALL IS HOME TO A HUNGRY CHILD EATING PYTHON 
SHE'LL BE WAITING IN ONE OF THE HOLES FOR A LITTLE SNACK 
IT'S SIMPLE 
IF THEY GET BITTEN THREE TIMES THEY FAIL 
CAN THEY TRUST EVERYONE ON THEIR TEAM 
NOT LIKELY BUT WHO WILL IT BE 
THAT'S UP TO THE VOICE 
ROCHELLE DO NOT REACT 
YOU ARE THE SABOTEUR 
IT IS YOUR JOB TO ENSURE YOUR TEAM FAIL THIS CHALLENGE 
YOU CAN DO THIS BY STEERING YOUR TEAM TOWARDS THE SNAKE 
I WILL TELL YOU WHERE THE SNAKE IS 
YOU MUST USE YOUR POWERS OF PERSUASION TO FAIL THIS TASK 
BUT BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T WANT TO BE DETECTED 
ROCHELLE IS THE NEXT SABOTEUR 
SHE'S NOT TO BE TRUSTED 
I KNOW THAT AND YOU KNOW THAT BUT THE REST OF THEM DON'T 
UNFORTUNATES THIS CHALLENGE IS SNAKE ATTACK 
YOU MUST AVOID THE CHILD EATING PYTHON 
LET THE CHALLENGE BEGIN NOW 
I THINK ROCHELLE THE SNAKE IS IN THE TOP HOLE 
YEAH THAT ONE I THINK 
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT IT IN THAT ONE AS WELL 
THAT'S IT NICE AND SUBTLE THEY'RE GOING FOR IT 
AAH OOH 
YES 
EXCELLENT WORK ROCHELLE 
THE SNAKE IS IN THE BOTTOM HOLE 
WHO VOTES ON THE TOP ONE 
I DON'T THINK SO 
MIDDLE NO I THINK IT'S THAT LITTLE ONE THERE 
OR SHOULD WE DO THE BOTTOM ONE 
ANYONE THINK THAT 
YEAH LET'S DO IT 
IF THERE'S A SNAKE I'M GOING TO KILL YOU 
CUNNING ROCHELLE NICE WORK 
ARGH 
OH NOT AGAIN 
ROCHELLE STEER THE TEAM GENTLY 
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOO OBVIOUS 
YOU NEED JUST ONE MORE THE SNAKE IS IN THE TOP 
WHO THINKS IT'S THE TOP ONE 
THEY DON'T SEEM VERY CONVINCED 
TOP ONE TOP 
ROCHELLE SAID DO THE TOP ONE I DON'T KNOW BUT WE SHOULD DO THE TOP ONE 
BECAUSE NOBODY'S DONE THE TOP ONE O. K. 
AAH NOT AGAIN 
YOU HAVE FAILED MISERABLY 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE SNEAKY TO SABOTAGE SUCCESSFUL LIKE 
DID THE SABOTEUR HAVE WHAT IT TAKES 
YOU MUST NOW VOTE FOR WHO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR IS TIA 
I THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS ROCHELLE 
BECAUSE THE SECOND TIME AIMEN PUT HIS HAND IN SHE SAID I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A CLUE 
ROCHELLE 
I THINK IT WAS TIA BECAUSE SHE NEVER MADE MUCH CONTRIBUTION TO 
WHERE WAS THE SNAKE 
AIMEN WHO DO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS 
I THINK IT WAS ROCHELLE 
FIRSTLY SHE GOT MY HAND DIRTY 
SECONDLY BECAUSE 
IT'S HER NIKICA 
I THINK IT WAS ROCHELLE 
BECAUSE SHE SUGGESTED THE LAST TWO AND IT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG 
AND SHE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT SHE WAS SAYING 
YOU HAVE VOTED FOR ROCHELLE 
THE SABOTEUR WAS IN FACT 
ROCHELLE 
ROCHELLE YOU WILL NOT BE LEAVING THIS ROOM 
THE OTHERS ARE FREE TO PASS TO THE NEXT FLOOR 
TRAPPED HAHA 
ROCHELLE WHY DO YOU THINK THE OTHERS VOTED FOR YOU 
I MADE THE WRONG DECISIONS AND I WAS HESITANT 
POOR UNFORTUNATE ROCHELLE 
YOU'RE TRAPPED 
AND ROCHELLE WAS FOUND OUT 
NOT A GOOD PLAN FOR A SABOTEUR 
FLOOR THREE POISON BANQUET 
THIS FLOOR IS A FEAST OF WICKEDNESS 
AH THE UNFORTUNATES HAVE BITTEN OFF MORE THAN THEY CAN CHEW 
THIS WILL LEAVE A NASTY TASTE IN THEIR MOUTHS 
THE UNFORTUNATES FACE A FIVE COURSE BANQUET 
TAKING IT IN TURNS THEY MUST EAT ONE CAKE FROM EACH COURSE 
BUT UNFORTUNATES BEWARE 
ONE OF THE THREE CAKES IN EACH COURSE IS POISON 
URGH TO PASS THE CHALLENGE 
THE TEAM MUST EAT THREE GOOD CAKES BEFORE THEY EAT THREE POISONED ONES 
BUT WHO IS THE DINNER GUEST TRYING TO POISON THE OTHERS 
YOU KNOW THE DRILL WHO WILL IT BE 
WHO WILL IT BE WHO WILL IT BE 
HA HA DON'T ASK ME IT'S UP TO THE VOICE 
AIMEN DO NOT REACT YOU ARE THE SABOTEUR 
IT IS YOUR JOB TO ENSURE YOUR TEAM FAIL THIS CHALLENGE 
YOU CAN DO THIS BY POISONING YOUR TEAM AND OF COURSE YOURSELF 
I WILL TELL YOU WHERE THE POISON IS 
IT IS UP TO YOU HOW YOU USE THIS INFORMATION 
SO THE NEXT SABOTEUR IS AIMEN 
IF HE REMAINS UNDETECTED AIMEN WILL BE SAVED 
AND JUST A FLOOR FROM FREEDOM BUT CAN HE DO IT 
UNFORTUNATES THIS IS POISON BANQUET 
TO PASS YOU MUST EAT THREE GOOD CAKES BEFORE 
YOU EAT THREE POISONED ONES 
AIMEN THE POISON IS IN THE CAKE WITH THE PURPLE SWEET ON 
I THINK I THINK THAT WHITE ONE LOOKS GOOD WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YEAH IT DOES I REALLY LIKE IT 
YES IT DOES LOOK GOOD BUT IT'S NOT THE ONE YOU WANTED THEM TO PICK 
THE POISON IS IN THE CAKE WITH THE BLUE SWEET 
I THINK THE BLUE ONE NO ACTUALLY I THINK RED

HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE COLOUR POISON IS 
TIA YOU CAN HELP US BUT YOU CAN'T EAT IT 
NIKICA HAS TAKEN OVER AND HE'S EATING THE THIRD GOOD CAKE 
YOU HAVE PASSED 
THEREFORE THE SABOTEUR IS AUTOMATICALLY LOCKED IN THE ROOM 
BEING A SABOTEUR IS NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS IS IT 
AIMEN WHO DO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS AND WHY 
I THINK IT WAS TIA BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE EATING THE CAKE 
THAT ONE IN CAKE TWO SHE SORT OF WENT GO TO THAT CAKE NIKICA 
I THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS TIA ALSO BECAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS LIKE HESITATING 
EVERY FEW MINUTES SECONDS SO I REALLY THINK IT WAS HER 
TIA WHO DO YOU THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS 
I THINK THE SABOTEUR WAS AIMEN BECAUSE ON THE SECOND CAKE 
HE HESITATED AND SAID NO NO THIS ONE THIS ONE 
YOU VOTED FOR TIA 
THE SABOTEUR WAS IN FACT 
AIMEN 
AIMEN AIMEN ALTHOUGH YOU WERE UNDETECTED YOU HAVE FAILED 
TO SABOTAGE THE CHALLENGE AND WILL NOT BE LEAVING THIS ROOM 
CRIPES 
THE OTHERS ARE FREE TO PASS TO THE NEXT FLOOR 
AIMEN HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING TRAPPED 
I'M NOT REALLY SAD BECAUSE I GOT UP TO THE THIRD LEVEL 
AND SOME PEOPLE NEVER WENT UP TO THAT STAGE 
POOR UNFORTUNATE AIMEN 
YOU'RE TRAPPED 
AIMEN CAN ONLY BLAME HIMSELF FOR THAT TRAPPING AND NOW 
MORE OF THEM TRAPPED THAN FREE 
THAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR ME 
FLOOR TWO ONE WAY OUT AND THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER 
IT'S THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM 
LET'S HOPE THEM UNFORTUNATES HAVE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION 
NOW THEY HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR FREEDOM BY ANSWERING QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THEIR TIME IN THE TOWER 
THEY'RE BOTH AFTER THE KEY OF FREEDOM IT'S SIMPLE 
WIN AND YOU'LL ESCAPE LOSE AND YOU'LL BE TRAPPED 
HO HO I'M SO EXCITED I COULD DANCE AND JIG IN MY GRANNY'S PYJAMAS
