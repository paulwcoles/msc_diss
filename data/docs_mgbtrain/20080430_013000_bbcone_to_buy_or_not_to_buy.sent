THIS IS MICHAEL WESTON KING 
I SAW THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF THIS TOWN 
AND THIS IS LOU DALGLEISH 
COS I'M SO SORRY 
YOU MAY RECOGNISE THEM AS THEY ARE PROLIFIC SINGER SONGWRITERS AND VERY TALENTED MUSICIANS 
WITH PERFORMANCES WITH THE LIKES OF NICK CAVE AND BRYAN FERRY 
WITH THEIR MUSICAL LIFESTYLES AND A TWENTY TWO MONTH OLD BALL OF FUN MABEL 
THEY HAVE LITTLE TIME FOR HOUSE HUNTING 
THEIR NEW HOME IN BIRMINGHAM MUST ACCOMMODATE THEM AND THEIR TODDLER 
AND SADLY LOU RECENTLY LOST HER DAD SO MUM VAL IS MOVING TO LIVE WITH THEM AND WATCH MABEL PERFORM 
LOU MICHAEL YOU ARE BOTH MUSICIANS YES STILL WORKING

I WOULD WELCOME WHAT WOULD YOU WELCOME I'D WELCOME TO BE OFF THE ROAD FOR A BIT AND STAY AT HOME 
WITH MY LOVELY WIFE AND DAUGHTER JUST WITH MY DAUGHTER LOU CAN GO OUT ON THE ROAD 
WHERE ARE YOU AT THE MOMENT WE'RE IN ACCOMMODATION THAT'S JUST FAR TOO SMALL 
IT'S LOVELY BUT WE'VE GOT NO ROOM 
WE WANT TO MOVE TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN LIVE WITH MUM 
NOT WITH MUM BUT ALONGSIDE MUM SO THAT WE'RE AT ARM'S LENGTH BUT WE'VE GOT OUR INDEPENDENCE 
SHE'LL SEE MABEL EVERY DAY AND I'LL KNOW THAT MUM'S SAFE AND HAPPY AND SHE CAN KEEP AN EYE ON US

THAT'S JUST WHAT I WANT WE NEED AN OFFICE FOR YOU WELL FOR US 
WELL FOUR BEDROOMS A MUSIC ROOM FOUR BEDROOMS O. K. 
WE WANT TO STAY AROUND MOSELEY WHERE WE'VE LIVED FOR NINE YEARS 
IT'S A TOUGH ASK COS WE'VE NO MONEY TO SPEND 
WHAT ABOUT THE AGE AND STYLE OF THE PROPERTY I DON'T REALLY CARE I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT 
HE CARES WHEN WE'VE LOOKED BEFORE I'M REALLY BIG ON OLDER HOUSES I REALLY DON'T LIKE NEWER HOUSES 
I JUST CAN'T SEE MYSELF SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON A HOUSE THAT I DON'T REALLY AESTHETICALLY LIKE 
WHEREAS I WOULD WHAT ABOUT WORK ON A HOUSE 
ARE YOU THE KIND OF 
ARE YOU THE KIND OF COUPLE WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO DO A BIT 
NO NO EASY ANSWER 
IF THE HOUSE WAS BELOW BUDGET AND THERE WAS MONEY LEFT OVER 
TO GET SOMEONE ELSE TO DO WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE THAT WOULD BE O. K. WE'RE NOT VERY PRACTICAL 
WHAT DO WE NEED OUTSIDE THIS PROPERTY 
WE NEED A SAFE LITTLE GARDEN SO MABEL CAN PLAY OUTSIDE 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BIG 
IF WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A COMPROMISE WHERE DO WE MAKE THOSE COMPROMISES 
THE AREA I SUPPOSE OUR HEART IS SET ON HERE AS THIS IS WHERE WE LIKE 
BUT THERE ARE OTHER PARTS SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO COMPROMISE 
WITH NO COMPROMISE WHAT IS THE BUDGET WELL THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IS AS MUCH AS WE CAN GO TO O. K. 
WE'LL GO AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DIG UP AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER O. K. WE'RE GONNA LIVE IN A CAVE 
SO CAN YOU PLAY AN INSTRUMENT J. P.

CYMBALS AND STUFF THE WHOLE DRUM KIT DON'T LAUGH WHAT ABOUT YOU

WE COULD HAVE A HIT ON OUR HANDS WHEN IT COMES TO PROPERTY WE'VE GOT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO SPEND IN MOSELEY 
IN MOSELEY THAT'S GONNA BE QUITE A TOUGH ONE YES BECAUSE THEY WANT FOUR BEDROOMS AND A GRANNY FLAT 
LET'S CALL IT AN ANNEXE I DON'T LIKE THE NAME GRANNY FLAT O. K. 
DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO IT WE CAN DO ANYTHING IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO 
I I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO 
I'LL TALK TO THE ESTATE AGENT COS IT'S WHERE MY EXPERTISE LIES I'LL MUCK AROUND WITH THE LOCAL FOLK 
MOSELEY HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE COSMOPOLITAN ANTIDOTE 
TO THE PROSAIC HIGH STREET MONOTONY OF BIRMINGHAM PROPER 
SO IT'S A COOL PLACE FULL OF COOL PEOPLE LIVELY BARS RESTAURANTS AND INDEPENDENT SHOPS 
NOT TO MENTION A VICTORIAN PRIVATE PARK AND ORIGINAL DOVECOTE DATING BACK TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY COOL 
IT'S THREE MILES OUT OF BIRMINGHAM CITY CENTRE AND IS SURROUNDED BY KINGS HEATH AND BOURNVILLE 
WHICH ARE CATCHING UP WITH MOSELEY IN POPULARITY STAKES 
IT'S NO WONDER THAT HOUSE PRICES ARE STILL SLOWLY CREEPING UPWARDS 
AS EVERYONE WHO IS ANYONE WANTS TO LIVE HERE 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OTHER HOUSES IN TRENDY LOCATIONS FOR THREE FIFTY K. 
FOR THE EPITOME OF COOL HEAD TO CAMDEN 
THE BUDGET WOULD ONLY GET THIS ONE BED OPEN PLAN FLAT 
THERE'S A SHARED TERRACE AND IT'S IN THE HEART OF THIS DYNAMIC AREA 
IF YOU'RE HEADING TO MANCHESTER THE PLACE TO BE SEEN IS DIDSBURY 
WHERE YOU COULD BUY A THREE BEDROOM SEMI DETACHED FAMILY HOME 
IT HAS A MODERN CLEAN STYLE THROUGHOUT AND WOULD COST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
AND HEADING TO BRISTOL WHERE ELSE TO BUY BUT IN CLIFTON WHICH OFFERS UP THIS GEM OF AN APARTMENT 
WITH TWO BEDROOMS ONE WITH ITS OWN TIMBER DECKED BALCONY SOUTH FACING FOR EXTRA LIGHT 
IT'S NO WONDER THAT IT COSTS THREE HUNDRED FORTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
ARE YOU AND I COOL ENOUGH TO HANG OUT IN MOSELEY 
YOU LOOK GREAT NO I DON'T YOU DO I'M JUST DOWN TODAY JENNY 
I'M IAN PLEASED TO MEET YOU LINDA WILLIAMS

YOU'RE VERY BOHEMIAN LINDA JUST A LITTLE 
ARE YOU HAVING A GOSSIP WE'RE DECIDING OUR SHOPPING STRATEGY 
THAT'S A LOVELY HOUSE YES THEY WILL LIKE THAT ONE IT'S A BUSY ROAD BUT VERY POPULAR WITH LOCAL PEOPLE 
MY STRATEGY IS TO SEE IF I CAN SPEND MONEY THEN COFFEE AND CAKE 
THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT AGAIN BUNGALOW I HATE THAT WORD 
NO FABULOUS IT'S A DORMA BUNGALOW THEY'VE GONE INTO THE ATTIC HERE 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN THE CAFE ORGANIQUE TEA TEA A CUP OF TEA

JENNY WHAT ARE YOU DOING DON'T TALK TO ME YOU'LL SPOIL MY STYLE 
WHY ARE YOU WEARING GLASSES INSIDE IT'S NOT EVEN SUNNY MOSELEY IS COOL I'M JUST TRYING TO FIT IN 
YOU'RE NOT DOING VERY WELL JUST ORDER YOURSELF A SKINNY FRAPPUCCINO WITH SOYA OR SOMETHING 
I JUST WANT A CUP OF TEA I LOVE THIS TAKE YOUR GLASSES OFF 
I WAS ENJOYING THAT FOR A MINUTE I THOUGHT I WAS IN HOLLYWOOD 
LET'S MOVE ON FIND ANY HOUSES IT'S NOT EXACTLY IN MOSELEY 
I KNOW PEOPLE ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF POSTCODES ROUND HERE BUT IT IS VERY COOL IT'S VERY COOL 
MAYBE THE SUNGLASSES WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER 
BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THEIR SITUATION WITH MUM THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FIVE BEDROOMS 
BUT THE LAYOUT LENDS ITSELF TO HAVING MUM THERE 
DEEP DOWN THIS IS WHAT WE NEED 
I THOUGHT I'D FIND THEM A PLACE WHERE THEY WANTED SO I'VE GOT THEM A HOUSE IN MOSELEY 
LOOK AT THAT BEAUTY THAT'S COOL AND TRENDY I DON'T THINK SO 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH CHARACTER NINETEEN THIRTIES 
IT'S NOT VICTORIAN BUT YOU DON'T GET VICTORIAN HOUSES THAT SIZE IN THIS AREA AND WE'LL HAVE THIS 
THIS WILL BE THE WILD CARD IS IT DEFINITELY GONNA BE THE WILD CARD 
WHY ARE YOU GOING LIKE THAT IT IS VICTORIAN AND HAS CHARACTER BUT DOES IT FULFIL THE BRIEF 
NOT NECESSARILY BUT IT HAS THE WOW FACTOR PUT YOUR GLASSES BACK ON AND TRY AND FIT IN 
SHALL WE GET THINGS STARTED IT'S PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
LOU AND MICHAEL REQUIRE SPACE FOR THEIR MONEY IN A DESIRABLE AREA 
WELL I HAVE SOLVED THEIR PROBLEM WITH THIS VACANT DETACHED HOME ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MOSELEY 
WITH ROOM TO EXPAND I HOPE THEY'LL APPRECIATE MY IMPECCABLE TASTE 
MICHAEL LOUISE FORGET THE HOUSE WE'RE NEVER TOO OLD TO KICK LEAVES YEAH 
ANYWAY HERE WE ARE WE'RE STILL IN MOSELEY YOU MAY SAY ONLY JUST IAN 
WE ARE ON THE PERIPHERAL FRINGES BUT THE POSTCODE IS B. THIRTEEN 
IT IS FOUR BEDROOMS THE GRANNY ANNEXE IS NOT QUITE THERE BUT THERE'S POTENTIAL TO GET ONE 
I DIDN'T GET YOU A GARDEN I GOT YOU A NATIONAL PARK OUT THE BACK WHICH YOU'LL BE INTERESTED TO SEE 
IT NEEDS A BIT OF WORK JUST A BIT I DON'T WANT TO SCARE YOU OFF O. K. 
AND THERE'S LOTS OF ROOM INSIDE 
YOU SAID YOU NEED SPACE NOW HE'S CERTAINLY DONE THAT WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
IT LOOKS NICE AND TIDY FROM THE OUTSIDE

IN YOU GO WE'LL BE LISTENING TELL US WHAT YOU THINK AND WE'LL SEE YOU AFTERWARDS O. K. IN YOU GO 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE GOOD LIFE HE'S NOT INTERESTED IN IT ROCK'N'ROLL LIFE IS WHAT HE WANTS 
O. K. I'VE GOT ONE WILL THESE TWO BE HAPPY FOLK OR WILL I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE BLUES 
LOOK AT THIS 
INTERESTING YEAH 
THIS WOULD BE GOOD IF IT WAS A LITTLE KITCHEN BUT IT'S NOT 
IT'S A WASHROOM WHERE YOU PUT YOUR WASHING MACHINE 
SHE'S SPOTTED THE POTENTIAL 
QUITE A NICE ATMOSPHERE TO IT 
NICE PLAIN CARPETS NOT THAT THAT'S ANYTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING 
IT'S LIKE A GROWN UPS' HOUSE IT'S LIKE MY MUM AND DAD'S HOUSE 
THE WINDOWS ARE NICE YEAH THEY'RE REALLY NICE AND IT'S NICE AND CLEAN AND TIDY AND NEAT 
IT'S A LITTLE OLD FASHIONED AND NEEDS SOME DECORATION BUT IT'S IN FANTASTIC NICK 
THIS IS ALL RIGHT YEAH THAT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO GO STRAIGHT OUT ON TO THE GARDEN 
OH LOOK THAT'S A NICE GARDEN IT'S A LONG GARDEN 
YOU'D HAVE TO MOW ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THERE ONE ROOM FOR US AND ONE FOR MUM 
I CAN'T SEE WHERE WE'RE FITTING YOUR MUM IN O. K. 
UNLESS WE HAD THIS ONE SHE HAD THE FRONT ONE AND THAT OTHER ROOM WAS MADE INTO A KITCHEN FOR YOUR MUM 
VERY GENEROUS THIS IS A BIT BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
YEAH IT'S A BIT AMBITIOUS TO HAVE THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE THERE 
KITCHEN WAS BIGGER OR THE TABLE WAS SMALLER 
COULD PROBABLY FIT MABEL IN HERE GET A LITTLE TABLE FOR MABEL YEAH 
IT'S NOT QUITE A KITCHEN DINER IS IT NO BUT NICE VIEWS OUT INTO THE GARDEN LOOK 
THIS IS ALMOST THE BEST ROOM IT'S WHITE IT'S VERY MODERN 
I LIKE THESE TILES VERY NICE THIS'LL WORK FOR MUM 
YEAH 
THE STAIRS SEEM REALLY LITTLE DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT'S GOT A SMALL FEEL PETITE 
QUITE A SMALL LANDING IT GIVES AN ILLUSION OF BEING BIGGER THAN IT IS 
HOW CAN HE SAY IT'S SMALL UPSTAIRS IT'S NICE AND NEAT 
I KEEP SAYING THAT NICE WINDOWS THIS'D BE GOOD FOR MABEL 
SHE'S VERY POSITIVE LOU IS MICHAEL WE'LL HAVE TO TALK 
OH GOSH NICE BRIGHT BLUE VERY BLUE 
IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S A GOOD SIZE ROOM DON'T LIKE THE COLOUR THE CARPET'S ALL RIGHT 
THESE BLUE WALLS MAKE THE ROOM FEEL SMALLER THAN IT IS 
NOW WE'RE IN THE BEIGE ROOM WE'VE DONE THE LILAC ROOM AND THE BLUE ROOM AND THIS ONE HAS A SINK 
USEFUL I'D PREFER TO HAVE A TOILET IT'S A NICE BIG SINK 
CLEAN YOUR TEETH YOU'VE GOT TO LEAVE THE ROOM TO GO TO THE TOILET 
I CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY YOU JUST HAVE A SINK IN A ROOM 
LOOK AT THIS YES THIS IS ENOUGH ROOM FOR MY STUFF 
FANTASTIC ACTUALLY I COULD GO IN THERE I COULD SLEEP IN THERE 
WE COULD PUT YOU IN HERE CLOSE THE DOORS AT NIGHT IN THERE WITH THE COMPUTER 
GET MICHAEL A TREEHOUSE AND PUT HIM DOWN THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN OH NOW WE'RE IN THE PINK ROOM 
MAYBE THIS IS YOUR ROOM 
YES DO THESE CURTAINS REMIND YOU OF YOUR MUM COUPLE OF NIGHTIES I THINK 
MICHAEL'S MUM'S NIGHTIES 
AGAIN IT'S NICE NEAT AND CLEAN NICE TILES 
THE WHOLE THING IS VERY NICELY DONE IT'S KIND OF A BLANK CANVAS A BLANK CANVAS A BLANK CANVAS 
NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS I THINK IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE 
MICHAEL AND LOUISE YOU'VE HAD A LOOK ROUND YOU WERE MORE POSITIVE THAN YOU WERE MICHAEL 
NO IT REMINDS ME OF HOUSES I WAS BROUGHT UP IN NOT THAT I DIDN'T LOVE THE HOUSES I WAS BROUGHT UP IN 
I CAN SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR LOU'S MUM IRRESPECTIVE OF MY FEELINGS FOR THE HOUSE 
THERE'S A NICE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM AND THIS SPACE HERE 
WHICH COULD BE MADE IF WE KNOCK THIS WALL DOWN INTO A BEDROOM I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
THAT SPACE IS NOT A FULL GARAGE SO YOU COULD USE THAT ROOM 
BUT IT STILL GIVES YOUR MUM ONE GOOD SIZE ROOM FOR A BEDROOM AND A GOOD SIZE BATHROOM 
THEN IT'S THE COMPROMISE WITH THAT FRONT ROOM HOWEVER I'VE GOT ANOTHER IDEA WHICH IS IN THE GARDEN 
DOES YOUR MUM LIKE LIVING IN A TENT PUT MIKE IN IT LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
SO GUYS IT'S A BIG GARDEN AND YOU DON'T REALLY NEED A BIG GARDEN 
THERE'S AN AMAZING THING YOU CAN BUY AND IT'S AN OUTSIDE POD 
THEY CALL THEM ECO PODS OR STUDIO LIVING SPACES BUT YOU CAN GET THEM LIFTED INTO YOUR BACK GARDEN 
DON'T NEED PLANNING PERMISSION IT CAN HAVE A BATHROOM KITCHENETTE LIVING ROOM BEDROOM 
ALL IN ONE SELF CONTAINED UNIT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HAVING YOUR MUM DOWN THE GARDEN BUT IT'S NOT A GARDEN SHED 
THEY'VE GOT HEATING THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL YOU KNOW WHO'LL GO IN THAT HIM 
ARE THEY EXPENSIVE THOUGH IT COMES DOWN TO BUDGET 
FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO THIRTY THOUSAND YOU GET THE FINISHED ARTICLE O. K. 
DID SOMEONE MENTION CASH WHY DO YOU WANT SOME YES PLEASE 
I'LL REMIND YOU OF THE BUDGET WHICH WAS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND YEAH ARE YOU COMPETITIVE MUSICIANS 
WITH EACH OTHER YEAH ARE YOU THE RIVALRY LOOK AT THE BODY LANGUAGE LOOK AT THAT 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS THEN WHO'S GONNA HAVE A CRACK AT GUESS THE PRICE FIRST 
GO ON LOU 
THREE HUNDRED TEN 
ALL RIGHT O. K. 
WHAT'S THAT BIT THAT'S 
I THINK IT'S MORE THAN THAT I THINK IT'S NEARER OUR BUDGET I THINK IT'S THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
BIG DIFFERENCE IT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA GO FOR THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE YEAH 
WELL IT'S TRICKY MATHS HERE BUT THIS HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET FOR THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WHICH MEANS LOUISE YOU'VE WON I THINK I KNOW 
I KNOW I KNOW I KNEW I WOULD 
MICHAEL YOUR ARMS ARE STILL CROSSED WHICH TELLS ME IT'S NOT REALLY IMPRESSED ME NO 
I'M THINKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR YOUR MUM AND IT'S PRETTY GOOD 
IF THERE WAS TWENTY FIVE GRAND LEFT IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE THE DOWNSTAIRS GARAGE THING INTO A LIVING SPACE FOR HER 
IT COULD WORK IT'S A TRICKY ONE BUT IT'S THE FIRST PROPERTY TO CONSIDER 
ON ANOTHER NOTE SHALL WE GO AND SEE PROPERTY NUMBER TWO COME ON 
SORRY ABOUT THAT I'VE BEEN VERY CUNNING WITH MY CHOICE 
IT'S ON ANOTHER TREE LINED ROAD AND IN THE NEARBY AREA OF HALL GREEN 
WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY THE MOSELEY PREMIUM I'VE FOUND A BIGGER HOUSE 
JUST WAIT UNTIL THEY SEE THE KITCHEN 
GUYS THIS IS PROPERTY TWO GUESS WHAT FIVE BEDROOMS AND ALL OF A GOOD SIZE 
I KNOW YOU DO KNOW THE AREA ROUND HERE SO THEREFORE YOU DO KNOW WE'RE NOT IN MOSELEY 
WE'RE NOT IN MOSELEY WE'RE IN HALL GREEN SO WE'RE VERY CLOSE 
WE'RE ON THE CUSP WE DID SAY THERE MIGHT HAVE TO BE SOME COMPROMISE 
O. K. O. K. WHEN YOU GO IN I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT THE LAYOUT SUITS YOUR SITUATION WITH MUM PERFECTLY 
MICHAEL YOU LIKE AN OLD VICTORIAN PROPERTY AND THAT'S WHAT OH 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THIS IT'S GOT A SORT OF MEDITERRANEAN CHARACTER ABOUT IT HASN'T IT 
WERE WE NOT IN THE RAIN AND NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF BIRMINGHAM WE COULD BE IN CORFU 
WELL DONE MICHAEL IT'S NICE TO KNOW I HAVE FRIENDS 
WELL MOVING ON MOVING IN WE'LL SEE YOU AFTERWARDS O. K. ALL RIGHT 
DON'T MIND ME WITH THAT UMBRELLA 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS ONE J. P. VERY CONFIDENT 
AT LEAST IT'S NOT RAINING IT'S NICE AND CLEAR CLEAN NEAT 
THAT WAY YEAH SHE LIKED CLEAN AND NEAT IN THE LAST PROPERTY 
THIS IS A DOCTOR'S WAITING ROOM A DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM 
WHY THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT COS OF THE PILE OF HELLO MAGAZINES YEAH 
I'LL TELL YOU WHY IT FEELS LIKE A DOCTOR'S SLASH DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM 
VERTICAL BLINDS AND EVERYWHERE IS WHITE I'D CALL THAT A BLANK CANVAS 
O. K. WELL YOU'VE GOT TO TRY AND IMAGINE IT WITH MUM IN HERE 
THE ROOMS ARE QUITE SMALL BUT MAYBE THERE'S MORE ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS O. K. KEEP AN OPEN MIND 
THE ROOMS THEY'RE IN NOW ARE THE ORIGINAL BUNGALOW THIS HAS HAD BITS ADDED ON TO IT 
WAIT TILL YOU GET OUT THE BACK 
WHAT'S IN HERE I DON'T KNOW 
IT'S QUITE A. OH GOSH 
LITTLE SHOWER THAT'S QUITE SWEET 
CLEVER USE OF THE SPACE BEATS A CLOAKROOM OH I SAY 
GOSH NOW HERE'S THE LITTLE SURPRISE WOW 
WHAT THE OH WE'VE GOT AN OPEN PLAN OH CRIKEY 
I SEE GOSH THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE GIVES NO HINT OF THIS DOES IT 
EXACTLY IT'S GETTING BETTER O. K. WHAT'S IN HERE OH 
WHAT'S THIS AH THIS IS YOUR ROOM 
THIS IS A CORRIDOR IT'S LIKE THE LARDER OF SOME DESCRIPTION 
IT'S A LAUNDRY ROOM A LAUNDRY ROOM IT'S QUITE A USEFUL LITTLE CORRIDOR 
THE FAMILY COULD ALMOST USE THAT SIDE ENTRANCE AND MUM COULD USE THE FRONT DOOR 
YEAH 
WHAT CAN YOU SAY AMAZING I DON'T KNOW IF I LIKE IT I KNOW 
YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE IT BARE IT'S VERY MODERN THIS HAS ALL GONE VERY OPEN PLAN MODERN 
I SEE MUM'S AT THE FRONT IN THOSE TWO ROOMS WITH THE BATHROOM 
THESE TWO COULD MAKE THIS HOUSE WORK FOR THEIR NEEDS 
BUT I SUSPECT MICHAEL ISN'T GONNA BE ABLE TO SEE PAST THIS HOUSE 
IT'S PROBABLY TOO OPEN PLAN FOR US YEAH WE'D NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT 
IT'S JUST A BIT OVERWHELMING I WANT TO GO UP THOSE STAIRS NOW IT'S OBVIOUSLY INTRIGUING 
I COULD HAVE MY COCKTAIL DRESS ON COME DOWN THE STAIRS AT MY PARTY AND SAY ARE THE GUESTS HERE 
OH IS THIS A CUPBOARD OFFICE IF YOU SIT DOWN TWO YEAR OLD 
IT'S A PERFECT SIZE FOR A LITTLE ONE A PERFECT SIZE FOR MABEL 
THEY'RE PAINTED WHITE SO THEY JUST DO WHAT THEY SAY ON THE TIN 
SLIGHTLY LACKING BUT ONCE THEY PUT THEIR MARK ON IT 
OH O. K. O. K. IT'S NOT SO COSY IS IT 
NO IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY COSY IT'S JUST ALL CLEAN AND 
WHICH YOU LIKE BUT NOT MUCH CHARACTER IT'S A BLANK CANVAS O. K. 
WE'RE VERY CONFORMIST AS A SOCIETY IN TERMS OF WHAT WE LIKE 
WE LIKE TO HAVE OUR CHOCOLATE BOX HOUSES OR VICTORIAN ROWS OF HOUSES THIS HOUSE IS UNIQUE 
IT'S GOOD TO BE UNIQUE AND THEY'RE A UNIQUE COUPLE IF ANYONE CAN PULL IT OFF THEY CAN 
O. K. HERE'S THE BATHROOM IT'S A SMALL BATHROOM IT IS IT'S TINY 
I DON'T THINK IT'S TINY IT'S DECEPTIVE BECAUSE THE HOUSE LOOKS SO BIG AND IT'S LIKE 
THIS LIGHT IS NICE YOU COULD LIE IN THE BATH AND LOOK AT THE TREE 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BATHROOM AND THE FITTINGS IT'S JUST IT IS SMALL 
THAT IS A BATHROOM WITH A VIEW 
IMAGINE LOADS OF SOAP SUDS A FEW CANDLES YOUR FLUFFY ROBE ON THE DOOR 
OH HERE'S THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT'S A BIT BIGGER THAT'S THREE BEDROOMS 
YES BUT YOU COUNT THE TWO ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS 
THE WINDOWS ARE BIG AND THERE'S A LOT OF LIGHT SO THAT'S A PLUS POINT BUT I'M STRUGGLING TO FIND OTHERS 
THIS HOUSE TICKS ALL THE BOXES BUT WE'LL HAVE TO DO SOME BIG TIME SELLING TO CONVINCE THEM LET'S GO 
SO YOU KIND OF CAN SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM WITH THIS PROPERTY CAN YOU NOT I CAN ABSOLUTELY YEAH 
KIND OF IT DOES TICK A LOT OF THE BOXES I'M ON YOUR MUM'S SIDE 
BECAUSE YOU WERE SAYING THERE'S THREE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS JENNY SAID THERE WERE FIVE THERE ARE FIVE 
YOU'VE GOT THIS ROOM AND THE ROOM ACROSS THE HALL FOR VAL YOU HAVE THE SHOWER AT THE END OF THE HALL 
SHE COULD HAVE THIS WHOLE AREA TO HERSELF 
YOU USE THE OTHER ENTRANCE AND GO STRAIGHT INTO THE OPEN PLAN LIVING WHICH SUITS YOU MORE DOES IT 
NO CLOSED PLAN LIVING THAT'S MY THING 
YOU COULD PUT SOME PARTITIONS UP I THOUGHT YOU'D BE STRUMMING YOUR GUITAR YOU'D BE SINGING 
NO WELL SOMETIMES WE'RE MISERABLE MUSICIANS WE NEED DARKENED SPACES TO BE CREATIVE 
O. K. IT'S FAR TOO LIGHT AND AIRY THE IDEA OF MUM BEING IN THESE FRONT ROOMS WOULD WORK BEAUTIFULLY 
IT HASN'T FILLED ME WITH ENTHUSIASM WE'LL GO AWAY AND THINK DON'T GO AWAY YET THANK GOSH YOU'RE HERE 
I SAID THE WORD OPEN PLAN SHE NEARLY BIT MY HEAD OFF 
SOME YOU WIN SOME YOU LOSE YOU WENT FIRST LOUISE AND SHE DID VERY WELL SHE WON IN FACT

I'M NOT CAROL VORDERMAN AM I CERTAINLY NOT WELL DONE

WE'LL SEE HOLD YOUR HORSES FOLLOW ME TO THE WILD CARD O. K. 
O. K. OUR WILD CARD ISN'T NECESSARILY WHAT YOU'D CALL PRACTICAL AS THERE ARE SLIGHT ISSUES ON PARKING

NOT TO MENTION THE PLETHORA OF ROOMS 
WE'RE NOT IN MOSELEY WE ARE IN KINGS HEATH SO FAR WE'VE GIVEN YOU A BIT OF CHARACTER AND PRACTICAL

I JUST NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT SURE BUT IT IS BEAUTIFUL WE THOUGHT THIS IS IDEAL FOR YOUR MUM 
BATHROOM BEDROOM AND NEXT DOOR SHE CAN HAVE A LIVING ROOM 
AND YOU COULD HAVE A TINY KITCHENETTE IN THERE 
SHE COULD HAVE A LITTLE SINK MICROWAVE A BIT OF A WORK SURFACE SO SHE COULD HAVE HER OWN SPACE 
AND THE BIGGEST RESERVATION IS THE STAIRWAY HERE 
I GUESS YOUR OPTION IS A KIND OF STAIR LIFT AT SOME STAGE WHICH NOBODY PARTICULARLY WANTS 
WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED AN OFFICE NO MAYBE ONE OF THE DOWNSTAIRS ROOMS 
YEAH OR MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE I'VE GOT AN IDEA FOR AN OFFICE 
LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY AND OFFICES

SHALL WE TALK ABOUT THE PRICE LET'S MAYBE YOU COULD RENT AN OFFICE IN THE LOCAL VICINITY 
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUILD YOUR OWN OFFICE 
WHO'S WINNING THIS GAME IT'S EVEN STEVENS AT THE MOMENT YEAH SO THIS IS A DECIDER AS WELL

LOU YOU'VE WON BECAUSE YOU ARE CLOSER BUT YOU CAN GO AND HIRE YOUR OWN OFFICE 
OR MAYBE BUY YOUR OWN OFFICE AS THIS IS WAY UNDER YOUR BUDGET 
THIS IS AN AREA ON THE UP AND YOU GET MORE FOR YOUR MONEY 
TELL US TELL US ARE YOU READY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR THIS PLACE 
O. K. GOSH SO WAY WAY UNDER 
THAT'S A BIG CONSIDERATION AS THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF MONEY LEFT OVER 
WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU OFF NOW AND YOU HAVE A GOOD OLD THINK O. K. 
WE'LL MEET YOU AT THE PROPERTY THAT YOU DECIDE TO TEST DRIVE ALL RIGHT 
WE'LL WAIT HERE IN THE OFFICE I'LL SIT AT MY DESK SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO OFF O. K. 
HERE'S A REMINDER OF ALL THREE PROPERTIES WE'VE SHOWN THEM TODAY 
HOUSE ONE HAD THAT ALL IMPORTANT POSTCODE AND ENOUGH SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE 
WITH AN ADAPTABLE LAYOUT PERFECT FOR VAL AND THAT GARDEN WITH THE OPTION OF A FANCY POD 
BUT WAS IT JUST TOO MUCH OF THE GOOD LIFE AT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THEY ARE QUITE HARD TO PLEASE BUT THAT'S WHAT I TRIED TO DO WITH MY UNIQUE BUNGALOW IN HALL GREEN 
IT HAD THE IDEAL CONFIGURATION FOR A COMPLICATED FAMILY SITUATION AND A BEAUTIFUL KITCHEN DINER LOUNGE 
ALL FOR OFFERS OVER THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
AND THEN THE WILD CARD OFFERED LOU AND MICHAEL A BIT OF A COMPROMISE 
WITH PLENTY OF ROOMS BUT SOME MODIFICATION REQUIRED IN AN AREA CLOSE TO THEIR BELOVED MOSELEY 
WILL THEY BE WON OVER BY GORGEOUS FEATURES AND THIRTY SEVEN FEET OF KITCHEN 
WHICH WAS A REAL BARGAIN AT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
O. K. GUYS WELCOME TO YOUR CHOICE WHICH IS OF COURSE 
KINGS HEATH THE WILD CARD YES HOPEFULLY THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU 
IT LOOKS GREAT THERE'S A NICE FEEL ABOUT THE WHOLE PLACE 
OF THE THREE IT DEFINITELY WAS THE ONE WE CAN SEE MUM IN THERE AS WELL 
WHICH IS KEY ISN'T IT IT IS KEY ARE YOU CHASING ME OUT 
WELL THIS MIGHT HELP YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION 
WE'VE HAD OUR TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR LOOK AROUND THIS HOUSE 
HE'S A PERNICKETY YOUNG FELLA BUT HE HAD TO CLUTCH AT CHIMNEYS TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS PLACE 
IF YOU CHOSE TO GO FOR THE PROPERTY YOU'D NEED TO GET YOUR OWN SURVEY DONE AS IT'S NOT LEGALLY BINDING 
ONE THING HE FOUND WAS THAT THE CHIMNEY IS A LITTLE BIT I THINK THE TECHNICAL TERM IS SKEW WHIFF 
THERE ARE NO MAJOR STRUCTURAL CRACKS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DECORATIVE BRICKWORK ALONG THE TOP 
IT HAS DROPPED A LITTLE BIT SO IT DOES SUGGEST THAT THERE'S A BIT OF SETTLEMENT IN THE MIDDLE 
THAT'S THE ONLY THING HE COULD PICK UP ON AND HE TRIES TO PICK UP ON SOMETHING 
YOU KNOW THAT PLACE I SUGGESTED COULD HAVE BEEN YOUR OFFICE 
DID HE LAUGH AT THAT AS WELL NO HE SAID JENNY DON'T WORRY I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA 
YOU KNOW THE FLOOR HAD THE GLASS YEAH WELL HE SUGGESTED THAT YOU DO GET IT CHECKED OUT 
FIND OUT WHO PUT IT IN WHEN IT WAS PUT IN I THINK IT'S MORE FOR PEACE OF MIND 
IT ALMOST FEELS WEIRD WHEN YOU WALK ON IT SHOULD I SHOULDN'T I IT'S MORE FOR THAT REALLY 
LESS OF THIS OUT HERE MORE OF THAT IN THERE IN YOU GO AND ENJOY YOUR TEST DRIVE SEE YOU LATER 
IT'S FINALLY TIME FOR VAL AND MABEL TO CHECK OUT THE HOUSE TOO 
THEY'RE OFF TO A GOOD START BUT WHERE'S MICHAEL 
SSH HE'S AN ARTIST HE NEEDS A BIT OF QUIET TIME AWAY FROM THE GIRLS 
IT LOOKS LIKE LOU WAS RIGHT ABOUT THOSE STEEP STAIRS 
AND THE GLASS FLOOR 
I KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE LONG BEFORE THE INSTRUMENTS WERE OUT 
THEY SHOULD SET UP A BAND KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY IT'S MABEL ON DRUMS 
YEAH 
VERY GOOD MICHAEL 
MAYBE A BIT MORE PRACTICE FOR MABEL THOUGH 
SO WHAT'S THIS HOUSE LIKE HOW DOES IT FEEL COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWO 
IT'S A LOVELY HOUSE BEAUTIFUL IT FEELS VERY SPACIOUS IT'S GOT NICE HIGH CEILINGS 
SO INSIDE IT'S VERY NICE 
I JUST HAVE CERTAIN RESERVATIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON OUTSIDE 
I.E PARKING AND THE VIBE THAT SORT OF THING THE VIBE 
THE VIBE O. K. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE 
THIS IS WELL UNDER BUDGET IT MUST BE VERY TEMPTING 
IT IS TEMPTING YEAH THERE ISN'T MUCH THAT NEEDS AMENDED TO THIS HOUSE COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWO 
THAT DOES LEAVE US WITH A BIT OF CASH LEFT OVER TO DO SOME AMENDMENTS IF NEEDED 
TO BUY A NEW VIBE OUTSIDE TO BUY A NEW VIBE YEAH 
TALK TO THE AGENTS PEOPLE IN THE AREA YOU SAID YOU HAD FRIENDS WHO LIVED IN THE ROAD 
THIS AREA IS ON THE UP AND IT'S HOW FAR UP IT GOES BASICALLY 
SHALL WE ASK THAT QUESTION YEAH TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
I THINK WE NEED TO THINK 
TO THINK OR NOT TO THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION 
WE CAN'T CATEGORICALLY SAY YES BUT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT LIKELY 
HAVE WE MADE YOU LOOK AT THINGS A BIT DIFFERENTLY YOU CERTAINLY HAVE JENNY 
OPEN PLAN LIVING SMALL OFFICES SMALL OFFICES AND HOUSES THAT BELONG IN OTHER COUNTRIES 
NEXT TIME WE NEED A HOUSE WITH A SMALL OFFICE THAT SHOULD BE IN CORFU WE KNOW WHERE TO COME 
IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR US TO GO YOU HAVE BEEN VERY ENTERTAINING 
AND A CHALLENGE FOR ME I'VE BEEN FINE I GOT AWAY WITH IT 
I'M NOW GONNA GO TO THERAPY BUT IT'S BEEN LOVELY MEETING YOU 
BEST OF LUCK THANK YOU AND FOR MABEL AND VAL
