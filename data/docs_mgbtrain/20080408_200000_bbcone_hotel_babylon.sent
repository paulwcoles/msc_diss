YOU WANT TO TAKE MY MONEY AND FOR ME TO ACCEPT IT AS A FAIT ACCOMPLI 
THE RICH ONCE GAVE THANKS BY WORSHIPPING IN THE CITY'S CATHEDRAL 
BUT ALL THAT HAS CHANGED 
NOW WE WORSHIP OUR HEDONISTIC CULTURE AT FIVE STAR TEMPLES SUCH AS HOTEL BABYLON 
WHERE WE'VE STOPPED WORRYING ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE NEXT WORLD 
BECAUSE WE'RE TOO BUSY ENJOYING OURSELVES IN THIS ONE 
AND IF THAT MEANS BETRAYING PEOPLE WHO LOVE US SO WE CAN GET RICH QUICK THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM 
IT'S NOT AS IF GOD'S WATCHING 
OR MAYBE HE IS 
SOME PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO FEEL GUILTY ABOUT ALL THIS EXCESS 
SO THEY LOOK TO A PREACHER OR A FAITH HEALER TO GUARANTEE THEIR TICKET INTO PARADISE 
MR. SLAUGHTER WE ARE SO PLEASED TO HAVE YOU WITH US IT'S AN HONOUR MR. PARMENTER 
I'M EMILY JAMES HEAD OF P. R. AND JACK HARRISON GENERAL MANAGER WELCOME

YES SIR YOUR ROOM DOES HAVE A PANORAMIC VIEW 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S THE WRONG PANORAMA 
IT'S THE MORON AGAIN SIR YOU CAN'T HAVE A ROOM OVERLOOKING BUCKINGHAM PALACE 
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY ROOMS THAT DO THAT GOOD DAY 
MY MOTHER LOVED YOUR MEETINGS 
SHE WAS REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THEM 
ESPECIALLY THE FAITH HEALING ASPECT I'M JUST THE LORD'S TOOL 
BUT WHEN I BROUGHT HER TO SEE YOU I HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS WOULD BE THE OUTCOME 
LOOK I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION I'D BE THE SAME 
BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I CANNOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR YOUR MOTHER'S DECISIONS 
SHE LEFT THIRTY THOUSAND TO YOUR ORGANISATION WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SEE THAT AS HER CHOICE 
BUT THAT MONEY WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TOWARDS A DEPOSIT FOR A LITTLE HOUSE BY THE SEA ONCE SHE 
WELL ONCE SHE OH HERE THANK YOU 
WHAT'RE YOU PLAYING AT BRINGING HER HERE I THOUGHT SHE HAD A STORY WORTH LISTENING TO 
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE WILL IT 
THE LORD MOVES IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS HIS WONDERS TO PERFORM 
RECEPTION 
IT'S A WEIRD MALE VOICE ASKING TO SPEAK TO THE FEMALE RECEPTIONIST 
TELL HIM I'M NOT HERE O. K. 
HELLO JUST HANDING YOU OVER SIR 
HE DISLIKES THE PICTURES ON HIS WALL I WON'T SPEAK TO HIM 
I'VE JUST SAID YOU ARE YOU ARE GOING TO DIE 
HMM WHEN I DO I'LL FIND MYSELF IN A MUCH HOTTER VERSION OF THIS LOBBY 
WITH YOU NO DOUBT ROASTING BESIDE ME 
HELLO SIR ANNA SPEAKING WELL OUR PICTURES ARE SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN TO BE AS INOFFENSIVE AS POSSIBLE 
THEIR INOFFENSIVENESS IN ITSELF IS OFFENSIVE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING 
HE HUNG UP ON ME 
UH OH 
RECEPTIONIST OR NOT NO ONE HANGS UP ON ME OH I'M SURE HE DIDN'T MEAN TO HE PROBABLY JUST SLIPPED RIGHT 
HOLD THE FORT WHOA WHAT IF I MIGHT NEED TO GO TO THE TOILET 
WHICH AS I'VE MENTIONED THE POSSIBILITY I NOW DO 
WELL HOLD IT AND THE FORT 
JAMES I NEED TO ASK YOU A FAVOUR 
YES OF COURSE IF I CAN 
THAT'S NOT WHAT I THINK IT IS 
INSIDE THIS URN ARE THE REMAINS OF THE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD SON OF ONE OF OUR GUESTS 
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND BRINGING HUMAN REMAINS INTO MY RESTAURANT 
THE GUEST HAS ASKED ME TO KEEP IT 
HIM THE URN WITH HIM INSIDE HE'S ASKED ME TO KEEP IT SOMEWHERE SAFE 
MIGHT I SUGGEST AND THIS MAY SOUND A LITTLE OLD FASHIONED BUT THE HOTEL SAFE 
IT'S FULL YOUR OFFICE THEN 
EVERY TIME I GO AND WORK I BECOME OVERWHELMINGLY CONSCIOUS THAT I'M SHARING THE ROOM WITH A. 
WITH A CORPSE IN POWDER FORM NOT AS EERIE SURELY 
EERIE ENOUGH WHICH IS WHY I'D LIKE YOU TO STORE IT FOR ME 
IN THE RESTAURANT 
YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF CUPBOARDS FOR STORING NAPKINS AND CUTLERY 
NOT THE DEAD 
ISN'T YOUR PAY REVIEW DUE IN A MONTH 
I AM SHOCKED AND APPALLED BY THE EASE WITH WHICH YOU WOULD ABUSE YOUR POSITION 
SO AM I BUT THEN I THINK WHY HAVE MY POSITION IF I CAN'T ABUSE IT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN 
I'LL JUST LEAVE IT HERE FOR YOU NO NO YOU CAN'T JACK 
WISH ME LUCK SON 
THAT'S MY MUM LOOK AT THAT SMILE ON HER FACE SHE WAS THE LIFE AND SOUL OF EVERY PARTY 
EVEN WHEN SHE NO LONGER RECOGNISED THE OTHER GUESTS 
AND HERE SHE IS JUST AFTER WE'VE SEEN JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR AT THE LYCEUM THEATRE SHE LOVED IT 
LOOK I'VE EXPLAINED MY POSITION 
NOW PLEASE OH 
PLEASE SHUT UP AND GO AWAY 
NO THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN IT'S WHAT YOU WANT 
YOU WANT TO TAKE MY MONEY AND FOR ME TO ACCEPT IT AS A FAIT ACCOMPLI 
MY MOTHER IS DEAD AND I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT 
BUT OUR HANDS ARE TIED YOU COULD UNTIE THEM YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO 
ROOM SERVICE 
DID YOU ORDER ROOM SERVICE 
NO DID YOU IF I HAD WHY WOULD I ASK YOU 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY YOU BROUGHT HER HERE 
SO HOW IN COMMAND OF YOUR SENSES ARE YOU AT THE MOMENT 
IF THEY'RE REALLY BUSY DOWNSTAIRS THEN OCCASIONALLY THEY GET THE ORDERS MIXED UP 
I SUPPOSE THE MOST EMBARRASSING EXAMPLE WAS WHEN A JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN 
ORDERED A SPIT ROAST BUT ACCIDENTALLY THE ORDER GOT TO TONY 
GO AWAY 
I THINK YOU MUST HAVE THE WRONG ROOM WE DIDN'T ORDER ANY 
DON'T SHOUT STEP BACK IN THE ROOM SIT ON THE BED 
OH WHAT 
IT'S OPEN 
I DON'T CARE I'VE ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION OF COMING IN 
NOW PLEASE COME TO THE DOOR I CAN'T 
WHY NOT BECAUSE YOU SOUND TOO ANGRY 
WHO'S IN THERE 
SURPRISE NED 
BUT YOU'RE AT A CONFERENCE IN GENEVA 
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED YOU TO THINK 
BUT WHY WIND ME UP WITH ALL THOSE RIDICULOUS PHONE CALLS IN THAT STUPID VOICE 
WELL BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE MORE I WOUND YOU UP THE MORE FUN I COULD HAVE UNWINDING YOU 
ISN'T IT ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE A GUN DO YOU NEED TO POINT IT AT US SHE'S RIGHT 
THREE YEARS AGO MY SON WAS SET TO GO TO UNIVERSITY 
WHEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKAEMIA WE ASSUMED HIS CHANCE HAD GONE 
BUT ONCE HIS TREATMENT KICKED IN YOU COULDN'T STOP HIM 
THE MEDICATION WAS TOUGH BUT IT WAS WORKING 
AND THEN ONE EVENING HALFWAY THROUGH HIS FIRST TERM FEELING LOW 
HE WENT LOOKING FOR EXTRA HELP 
AND FOUND HIMSELF IN A MEETING YOU WERE HOLDING IN THE UNIVERSITY CHURCH 
NO ONE'S MORE STRESSED THESE DAYS THAN YOUNG PEOPLE 
DEBT WEIGHT OF EXPECTATION 
I FEEL FOR THEM I REALLY DO 
AND TRUST ME SO DOES GOD 
WAS YOUR SON VERY RELIGIOUS 
NO BUT HIS NEW MEDICATION WAS TAKING TIME TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD 
HE WAS TIRED DOUBTING HIMSELF 
HE CAME TO YOU FOR A PRIVATE CONSULTATION 
GOD'S LOVE IS THE GREATEST MEDICINE OF ALL 
YEAH HE SAID THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD HIM 
HE TOLD US THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE HE FELT A DIFFERENT PERSON RENEWED STRONG 
CONVINCED BY THE POWER OF PRAYER 
BY THE TIME HIS MOTHER AND I FOUND OUT HE'D STOPPED TAKING HIS PILLS THE LEUKAEMIA HAD SPREAD 
HE COULD'VE HAD ANOTHER TWENTY ONE YEARS 
INSTEAD TWENTY ONE WAS HIS AGE WHEN HE DIED 
I'M SO SORRY 
I NEED A DRINK NOBODY MOVE 
WHOSE IS THAT 
IT'S MY BOSS 
LET IT RING OUT AND THEN TURN IT OFF 
HI IT'S EMILY JAMES' PHONE 
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE 
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I'M MISSED BY THEN I'LL HAVE DONE WHAT I CAME HERE TO DO 
MY FRIEND YOU'RE MAKING A TERRIBLE MISTAKE 
I WANT YOU OVER THIS SIDE THE REST ON THE BED 
CAN I JUST TAKE THIS YEAH ALL RIGHT BUT ONTO THE BED 
I NEVER TOLD YOUR SON TO STOP TAKING HIS MEDICINE 
IF HE HADN'T COME TO SEE YOU HE'D STILL BE ALIVE 
YOU OFFERED HIM FALSE HOPE 
I OFFERED HIM GOD'S LOVE 
IT'S WHAT I DO YOU MAY AS WELL HAVE STUCK A KNIFE IN HIS HEART 
WHATEVER YOUR GRIEVANCE IS AGAINST MR. SLAUGHTER THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO SOLVE IT 
I DON'T WANT TO SOLVE IT I WANT TO STOP HIM DOING IT TO SOMEONE ELSE 
NOW MOVE NO JONAH 
I WON'T I SAID MOVE 
COMING THROUGH EXCUSE ME 
SIR 
OOH 
OH 
ANNA YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL 
FUNNY 
SEXY WOMAN I'VE EVER MET 
I WANTED YOU FROM THE MOMENT I FIRST SET EYES ON YOU OH NED 
ANNA 
WILL YOU 
OH GOD I'M SO SORRY NO THIS IS NOT FAIR WELL WHY IS IT NOT FAIR HOW CAN YOU DECIDE 
WHETHER TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH ME WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL BE 
WELL I'M IMAGINING LOTS OF LOVELY THINGS 
YES WE'LL SPEND LOTS OF TIME TOGETHER AND WE'LL BE ONE OF THOSE COUPLES 
WHO ARE COMPLETELY DEVOTED TO ONE ANOTHER I PROMISE I'D LOVE THAT O. K. LET'S TRY AGAIN SHALL WE O. K. 
ANNA 
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A DRINK FIRST JUST TO ER 
YOU KNOW JUST TO STEADY OUR NERVES O. K. 
YOU SEE WHILE I WAS PLANNING ALL THIS IT ALL SEEMED COMPLETELY CLEAR IN MY HEAD 
GET DOWN ON ONE KNEE POP THE ER 
QUESTION 
I SUDDENLY REALISE THAT OUR LIFE 
OUR FUTURE TOGETHER IS FAR TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO BE COMPLETELY CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT 
BUT SPONTANEITY'S GOOD 
OH I LOVE SPONTANEITY 
BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT SPONTANEITY'S BEST WHEN PLANNED 
RIGHT 
I DEAL WITH PEOPLE IN DISTRESS EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK 
I HEAR WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN BENEATH THEIR WORDS WHAT THEY REALLY WANT 
AND WHAT DO I REALLY WANT 
TO EXPRESS YOUR PAIN FOR YOUR GRIEF TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED 
O. K. THAT'S IT I QUIT 
BE QUIET I AGREED TO PLAY THE PART OF AN AGGRIEVED VICTIM NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN BROAD FARCE 
NOW IS REALLY NOT THE TIME

GINO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN EMILY HAVE YOU THAT MAN WITH THE BOOK 
WHAT ABOUT HIM 
THINKING TO ASK HIM TO LEAVE MY BAR

THAT BOOK IS MAKING HIM LAUGH SO LOUD IT DRIVE ALL THE OTHER CUSTOMERS AWAY 
IT'S A. IT'S A VERY FUNNY BOOK YOU KNOW IT 
WELL OF COURSE IT'S A FAMOUS BOOK IT'S SET IN WORLD WAR TWO 
OH THAT'S IT 
IT IS ABOUT TO CATCH TWENTY TWO NAZIS EH NO 
CATCH TWENTY TWO IS THE EXPLANATION OF WHY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A SANE PERSON 
TO ESCAPE A CRAZY SYSTEM BY RATIONAL ARGUMENT ALONE 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND A SIMPLER VERSION WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE ERM 
WHAT CAME FIRST THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG 
THE EGG OBVIOUSLY AH YOU SEE WHAT LAID THAT FIRST EGG

O. K. THAT SOUNDS A LOT BETTER 
OH ANNA WITH YOU BY MY SIDE WE'LL HAVE A GLORIOUS LIFE OH 
NOW WHERE WERE WE 
AS THE SCENARIO IN WHICH I'M CURRENTLY CAST APPEARS TO BE BECOMING SOMEWHAT OVER CROWDED 
I SHALL TAKE MY BOW AND EXIT STAGE RIGHT PURSUED I HOPE NOT BY A MAN BEARING ARMS

YOU'RE HUGGING ME A LITTLE PREMATURELY NO MATTER THIS IS SURPRISINGLY NICE AH 
ARE THEY YOUR YOUR BREASTS I CAN FEEL UH HUH OH INTERESTING GINO CAN YOU READ THAT 
WE ARE BEING HELD IN ROOM FIVE HUNDRED TEN 
WHAT 
GUYS WE'VE GOT COLLEAGUES TO SAVE 
IN BUSINESS YOU WILL OFTEN HEAR THE EXPRESSION 
ARMED POLICE SUCH AND SUCH WAS DEALT WITH IN HOUSE 
THIS MEANS OUTSIDE AGENCIES THE UNIONS OR THE POLICE 
WERE NOT CALLED IN TO HELP RESOLVE SUCH AND SUCH SITUATION 
COME ON GET OUT GO GO 
STAY WHERE YOU ARE NO ONE MOVE 
IT MEANS THAT RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY 
STAFF HAVE MADE A DECISION TO DEAL WITH SUCH AND SUCH SITUATION THEMSELVES 
NOWHERE IS DEALING WITH THINGS IN HOUSE MORE POPULAR THAN IN THE HOTEL BUSINESS 
ARMED POLICE DON'T MOVE 
DON'T MOVE PUT YOUR WEAPONS ON THE FLOOR 
MISTAKES ARE EASY TO MAKE KEEP YOUR HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM 
OH SHIT 
AND MUCH MUCH HARDER TO PUT RIGHT 
RIGHT WE THINK THE SHOT CAME FROM JONAH SLAUGHTER'S ROOM HERE 
SO WHY DON'T WE CALL THE POLICE 
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WE ONLY THINK 
AND WE DON'T WANNA END UP WITH EGG ALL OVER OUR FACE LIKE LAST TIME 
SO WHAT DO WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE BEING HELD UNDER THE KETCHUP 
CORRECT WHY WE DON'T KNOW ALSO CORRECT SO THE BIG QUESTION IS 
YES WHAT THE BLOODY HELL IS GOING ON 
EXACTLY WE NEED TO FIND OUT PRECISELY WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS ROOM AND WE NEED TO FIND OUT FAST 
WE NEED DETAILED SURVEILLANCE THEN A PLAN OF ACTION BASED ON THAT 
GINO I WANT YOU TO HOLD THE FORT AT THE FRONT DESK NOW THE NEXT THING WE DO IS 
WHY ME BECAUSE YOU KEEP ASKING STUPID QUESTIONS AND YOU'RE GONNA SLOW THE WHOLE PROCESS DOWN THEN 
NO GINO I'M DOING MY PLAN NOW 
RIGHT SOMEBODY ENTERS THE VENTILATION SHAFT HERE 
MAKING THEIR WAY ALONG THE SHAFT TO HERE THE VENTILATION GRILLE THAT OVERLOOKS THE KETCHUP 
A. K. A. JONAH SLAUGHTER'S ROOM 
THEN THE REST OF US WILL MOVE INTO POSITION HERE 
WAITING TO MAKE THE DOUBLE PINCER MOVEMENT INTO THE ROOM AT THE GIVEN SIGNAL WHAT'S THE GIVEN SIGNAL 
AH I WAS THINKING THAT THE GIVEN COMMAND SHOULD BE 
MAKE THE DOUBLE PINCER MOVEMENT INTO THE ROOM NOW OR JUST NOW 
THAT'S EVEN BETTER I LIKE THAT YEAH 
THAT COMMAND SHALL BE GIVEN BY THE PERSON IN THE VENTILATION SHAFT WHEN THE MAN WITH OR WITHOUT THE GUN
