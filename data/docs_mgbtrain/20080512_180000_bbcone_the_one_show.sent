HELLO WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW 
WITH CHRISTINE BLEAKEY AND ADRIAN 
CHILES WITH US IS THE HIGHLY 
VISIBLE STAR OF THE INVISIBLES 
WARREN CLARKE AND HARDEEP SINGH 
KOHLI AND ONE VIEWER WHO IS ABOUT 
TO ACHIEVE IMMORTAL FOR KIPPING ON 
THE SOFA A NEW PAINTING ONE EXPECTED 
TO FETCH SEVERAL MILLION POUNDS IN 
NEW YORK TOMORROW 
BUT FIRSTLY IF YOU BELIEVE 
EVERYTHING YOU READ IN THE PAPERS 
PETERBOROUGH IS THE FIRST PORT OF 
CALL FOR MANY EASTERN EUROPEANS 
WANTING TO CALL IT HOME AND IT HAS 
MADE A POOR JOB OF KEEPING OUT OF 
THE HEADLINES THIS YEAR HFPLT LET'S 
FACE IT PETERBOROUGH IS PROBABLY 
NOT AT THE TOP OF MOST PEOPLE'S 
MUST VISIT LIST BUT THIS SMALL 
TOWN CANNOT KEEP OUT OF THE 
HEADLINES LOCAL FORCES PERSONNEL 
WERE BANNED FROM WEARING THEIR 
UNIFORM IN THE TOWN AND WITH THE 
INFLUX OF EASTERN EUROPEANS TO WORK 
THEY DEMANDED MORE CASH TO COPE 
WITH IT I'VE BEEN TO SEE 
COUNCILLOR CHARLES SWIFT WHO HAS 
BEEN FIVE COUNCILLOR HERE FOR OVER 
HALF A CENTURY 
THIS USED TO BE A 
SLEEPY LITTLE TOWN AND PEOPLE KNEW 
EVERYBODY 
WHEN YOU WALK AROUND NOW EVERYBODY IS IT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT WAS I I THINK I'VE SEEN EVERY CHANGE IN 
CREATION 
CHARLES WAS THE ARCHITECT CREATION OF MOST OF THESE CHANGES IT WAS A 
NEW TOWN IN THE SIXTIES AND HE 
ENCOURAGED IMMIGRATION TO THE CITY 
BUT NOT EVERYONE WELCOMED THE NEW 
ARRIVALS WARMLY THIS HEADLINE SAYS 
YOU WANT KICKING OUT 
OH YES AND 
I HAD WINDOWS SMASHED IN AND THEY 
WALKED UP AND DOWN HERE CONTINUOUS 
FOR THREE WEEKS WITH PLACARDS 
OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE 
THAT WAS THE 
NATIONAL FRONT AND THERE WERE 
DEATH THREATS AND GOODNESS KNOWS 
WHAT 
BUT THIRTY YEARS ON IT IS THE WHAT SCALE OF IMMIGRATION INTO 
PETERBOROUGH THAT IS WORRYING 
COUNCILLOR SWIFT THE COUNCIL 
ESTIMATES THAT AROUND ONE IN TEN OF 
ITS RESIDENTS ARE FROM EASTERN 
EUROPE 
WHERE WE'VE GONE WRONG NOW EUROPE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING IN LEFT 
RIGHT AND CENTRE YOU TAKE ME NOW 
REPRESENTING THIS AREA FOR FIFTY FOUR YEARS 
AND I HAVE TO HAVE INTERPRETERS 
GOING AROUND WITH ME NOW THAT CAN 
SPEAK EIGHTEEN LANGUAGES BETWEEN THEM 
BUT DO OTHERS SHARE MR. SWIFT'S 
WORRIES 
OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS WORRIES IT'S BECOME A HUGE METROPOLIS AND 
I THINK IT'S LOST ITS SOUL 
EVERYONE WANTS WHERE THEY LIVE TO 
CHANGE FOR THE BETTER 
THE CHANGE 
THAT CONCERNS RESIDENTS THE MOST IS 
THE PRESSURE OF PUBLIC SERVICES 
THERE IS IS SHORTAGE OF HOUSING 
AND OF COURSE THAT MUST BE THE 
CASE ALL OVER THE BRITISH ISLES 
BUT IT IS BECOMING A LOT WORSE 
THESE DAYS WITH THE INFLUX OF 
IMMIGRANTS 
WHAT IS 
THE EFFECT ON IMMIGRANTS THE LOCAL SERVICES 
YOU COULD 
DESCRIBE IT IN SOME RESPECTS AS 
ORGANISED CHAOS THERE IS PRESSURE 
ON THE SERVICES YOU ONE THE LOCAL 
DOCTOR AT THE TOP OF THE ROAD HERE 
ONE THOUSAND NEW PATIENTS IN TWO AND A 
HALF YEARS THERE ARE PROBLEMS THAT 
COULD BE TAKEN CARE OF IF THEY HAD 
THE RESOURCES TO DO WITH IT MANY MANY MIGRANTS WHO HAVE SETTLED IN THE 
AREA HAVE BROUGHT THEIR CHILDREN 
WITH THEM FOURTEEN YEARS AGO THERE WERE 
ONLY TWO MIGRANT CHILDREN IN THIS 
PRIMARY SCHOOL FULBRIDGE AND NOW 
THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED 
MANY OF THEM 
DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH AT ALL AND 
THAT CAUSES PROBLEMS 
WHAT SUPPORT 
HAVE YOU HAD 
WE CREATE THE SUPPORT 
THERE IS NO EXTRA FINANCIAL SUPPORT 
OR ANYTHING L. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
APPOINT TWO EXTRA MEMBERS OF STAFF 
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHO ARE ABLE 
TO SPEAK LANGUAGES BUT WE HAVE THIRTY 
DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES HERE AND WE 
CAN'T COVER THEM ALL 
HOW WELL 
WOULD YOU EXPECT THEM TO INTEGRATE 
OVER THE YEARS 
IT DEPENDS ON THE 
CHILD THERE ARE SOME VERY SHY ONES 
FORTY ARE NOT SETTLED STILL BUT MOST 
INTEGRATE REALLY REALLY WELL IN IN FACT INTEGRATION CAN BE DIFFICULT 
FOR SOME OLDER MIGRANTS HAVE YOU 
FOUND IT EASY TO FIND WORK AND 
SETTLE IN 
NO NOT EASY THE 
PROBLEM IS LANGUAGE 
I THOUGHT I 
WOULD EARN MORE MONEY 
WHAT IS THE 
ATTRACTION OF PETERBOROUGH FOR YOU 
I DON'T KNOW THE FIRST PLACE WE 
STOP IS PETERBOROUGH YOU 
UNDERSTAND 
EMPLOYERS HERE IN UNDERSTAND PETERBOROUGH SAY ALL THIS 
IMMIGRATION IS A GOOD THING THEY 
SAY THE MIGRANTS ARE FILLING GAPS 
IN THE LOCAL LABOUR MARKET AND 
OFTEN DOING JOBS THAT LOCAL PEOPLE 
SIMPLY WOULDN'T WANT TO DO WITHOUT WITHOUT DOUBT THERE ARE JOBS THAT THE 
MIGRANTS ARE PICKING UP AND DOING 
THAT PERHAPS THE LOCAL RESIDENTS 
ARE NOT SO KEEN TO DO THERE IS NO 
DOUBT IN MY OWN BUSINESS WE EMPLOY 
A COUPLE OF MIGRANTS AND THEY'RE 
JUST FANTASTIC EMPLOYEES SOME SOME LOCAL PEOPLE FEEL SOME OF THE 
MIGRANTS ARE TAKING JOBS THAT THEY 
RIGHTLY FEEL SHOULD BE THEIRS AND AND WE SHOULD KEEP AN EYE ON THAT BUT 
EQUALLY SOME OF THOSE COMPLAINING 
DON'T WANT TO DO THE JOBS AVAILABLE 
PETERBOROUGH HAS ONE OF THE FASTEST 
GROW ECONOMIES IN THE COUNTRY AND 
AS MORE MIGRANTS SETTLE HERE THE 
FUTURES OF THE CITY WILL 
UNDOUBTEDLY BEA MORE DIVERSE ONE I I THINK THAT THE SCHOOL WE REFLECT 
THE CHANGES IN PETERBOROUGH MY AIM 
IS THAT THESE CHILDREN BECOME 
RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS IN THE WORLD 
IN WHICH THEY GROW UP WHICH WILL 
BE VERY MULTI CULTURAL THEY'RE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY BEFORE IT 
WAS JUST UGANDANS AND ASIANS COMING 
IN AND NOW THE COUNCILLOR SAYS 
THEY ARE COMING IN FROM ALL OVER 
THE SHOP AND THAT'S HIS PROBLEM 
THAT'S RIGHT FIRSTLY THEY WERE 
MIGRANTS SEEKING ASYLUM THEY WERE 
SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE WHO SPOKE ENGLISH 
FOR EXAMPLE AND BECAUSE OF LINKS 
WITH THE EMPIRE AND THE LIKE THEY 
WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE SET UP IN 
THIS COUNTRY WHAT IS DIFFICULT FOR 
THESE PLACES IS THAT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE COME AND GENERALLY SPEAKING 
REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE BRITISH 
PEOPLE DO NOT EXERCISE A LOT OF 
GOODWILL FOR THESE PEOPLE BUT WHEN 
THAT GOODWILL IS NOT THERE IT IS 
WHEN THE SERVICES ARE OVERSTRETCHED 
WHY SHOULD THE SCHOOLS HAVE TO PAY 
FOR INTERPRETERS AND THE LEAST THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN DO IS A WEE BIT OF 
JOINED UP THINKING WHEN ENOCH 
POWELL BROUGHT IN AFRICANS IN THE 
FIFTIES HE BROUGHT THEM IN TO DO 
SPECIFIC JOBS AND THERE WAS THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE IT SEEMS 
NOW YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT 
IMMIGRATION WITHOUT BEING ACCUSED 
OF BEING RACIST THEY ARE TWO 
SEPARATE ISSUES THAT SOMETIMES 
CONJOIN BUT NOT ALWAYS 
AND A LOT 
OF THE JOBS THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING 
THE REST OF US DON'T WANT TO DO AND 
WE'RE LOST WITHOUT THEM 
AND THERE IS A STORY ABOUT THAT IN 
THE PAPERS TODAY JUST NOT JUST 
ABOUT PETERBOROUGH BUT THE NUMBER 
OF STRAWBERRIES THAT ARE GOING TO 
BE LEFT IN THE FIELDS BECAUSE 
FARMERS CAN'T GET THE PICKERS WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO PICK YOUR OWN THERE'S THERE'S FIFTY THOUSAND AECKERS OF THEM THERE NONE 
OF US WOULD WORK IF WE WERE PICKING 
OUR OWN BUT IT WARMS THE COCKLES 
OF MY HEART TO SEE ALL THOSE LITTLE 
SCHOOL CHILDREN IN THAT SCHOOL YES YES THERE IS A GREAT RICHNESS IN 
PEOPLE'S LIVES KIDS GROW UP WITH 
FRIENDS WHO WERE BORN AND BROUGHT 
UP IN THIS COUNTRY OR FRIENDS WHO 
HAVE COME IN FROM OTHER PARTS OF 
THE WORLD AND IT ADDS TO OTHERS' 
LIVES MY PASSION IS FOOD YOU CAN 
TELL 
YOU DON'T LIKE STRAWBERRIES TELL DO YOU 
NOT UNLESS THEY ARE 
OCCURRIED OCCURRIED ONE SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE 
PROBLEMS OF THAT PRIMARY IN 
PETERBOROUGH IS ETON ONCE UPON 
TIME EVERY POLITICIAN WORTH HIS 
SALT WENT TO ETON BUT MORE 
RECENTLY IT HAS BEEN SEEN AS A 
POLITICAL HANDICAP TO BE AN OLD 
ETONIAN BARRIS JOHNSON'S ELECTION 
AS MAYOR SUGGESTS THAT NOW IT MAY 
NOT BE SUCH BAD THING BUT WE 
COULD ONLY AFFORD TO SEND ARTHUR 
SMITH TO ETON FOR DAY FAVOURED 
BY ROYALTY POLITICIANS AND HIGH 
FLYERS ETON WHERE PUTTING YOUR 
BOY THROUGH HIS GCSES WILL SET YOU 
BACK ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND YEAR 
FOUNDED IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY BY HENRY THE SIXTH WITHIN 
A STONE'S THROW OF WINDSOR CASTLE 
ETON SCHOOL HAS BEEN THE ULTIMATE 
TRAINING GROUND FOR ENGLAND'S 
RULING CLASSES INCLUDING NO FEWER 
THAN EIGHTEEN PRIME MINISTERS BACK IN 
THE FIFTIES THREE OLD ETONIANS GOT 
THEIR HANDS ON THE TOP JOB ONE OF 
THEM WAS ALEX DOUGLAS HUME WHO MADE 
SATIRISTS LEAP WITH DELIGHT ALL ALL POLITICIANS BELONG TO GANGS OF 
CLIQUES BUT THE ETON CLIQUE IS 
QUITE A DAMAGING TAG AND IT HAS 
BEEN DAMAGING IN THE PAST BACK IN 
THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THAT WAS THE LAST TIME 
THERE WAS PRETTY MUCH A WHOLE 
CABINET FULL OF ETONIANS AND IT 
WAS A DISASTER 
TIMES WERE CHANGING 
AS GRAMMAR SCHOOLERS LIKE TED 
MAGGIE AND JOHN GOT THEIR HANDS ON 
THE KEYS TO NUMBER TEN THE UPPER 
CLASS NO LONGER HAD THE UPPER HAND 
WE SEEM TO HAVE FALLEN OUT OF LOVE 
WITH TRADITION RATHER THAN SPEAK 
RECEIVED PRONUNCIATION WE ALL WANT 
TO SPEAK IN HISTORY ENGLISH INUIT 
AND OUR STYLE ICONS BECAME THE 
SPICE GIRLS BUT THERE IS IS A NEW 
CHAPTER OF ETON HISTORY AND IS IT 
ABOUT TO BE WRITTEN IS THE BRITISH 
LOVE OF TOFFS ABOUT TO BURST INTO 
BLOOM ONCE MORE I'VE COME TO ETON 
TO FIND OUT WHY EX PUPILS LIKE 
DAVID CAMERON AND BORIS JOHNSON 
ARE FASHIONABLE AGAIN BUT I THINK 
I HAD BETTER SMARTEN UP MY ACT 
FIRST FIRST THIS IS A SCHOOL OUTFITTERS AND 
TAILORS TO THE GENTRY AND THEY'VE 
BEEN FITTING ETONIANS FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED 
YEARS YEARS RIGHT I SHALL RENDER MYSELF 
ETONIAN ETONIAN PRESENTING LORD ARTHUR SMYTH OF 
BALHAM 
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE FROM ETON ARE 
DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE DO YOU 
LIVE HERE NO 
WOULD YOU SEND YOUR NO BOY THERE 
IF I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO YES 
I THINK IT IS FASCINATING 
THAT YOU HAVE A SCHOOL TO PREPARE 
PEOPLE FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BY 
DRESSING THEM UP LIKE THEY ARE IN 
THE SEVENTEENTH 
DO YOU SEND YOUR SON 
HERE 
YES IT'S SOMETHING HE WANTED HERE TO DO 
WILL YOU BE PRIME MINISTER 
ONE DAY 
I DON'T KNOW MAYBE IF I 
WORK REALLY REALLY HARD AND DO MY 
BEST MAYBE ONE DAY 
IS IT THE 
COSTUME IS IT THE ACCENT THE OLD 
SCHOOL TIE OR THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR 
I WONDER HOW MY LIFE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN DIFFERENT HAD I BEEN HERE AT 
ETON MIGHT I HAVE BEEN SIR ARTHUR 
SMITH CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRY L. DOUBT 
IT WARREN ARE YOU ETON OR HARROW 
BARLOW HALL COMPREHENSIVE 
MANCHESTER 
DO EMPLOY A BIT OF MANCHESTER REVERSE SNOBBERY WHEN YOU COME 
ACROSS SOMEBODY FROM ETON 
NOT IN 
THE SLIGHTEST IT HAS NOTHING TO DO 
WITH ANYTHING 
IT IS AMAZING HOW 
SENSITIVE THEY ARE DAVID CAMERON 
WAS GOING TO BE OUR GUEST TODAY AND 
HE WAS GOING TO COME ON 
BUT HE 
HEARD I WAS COMING ON 
NO HE HEARD 
WE WERE DOING A FILM WITH ETON 
THEY HAVE TO GET OVER IT THEY DO 
THE IDEA THAT TONY BLAIR WAS THE 
FIRST PRIETYLY EDUCATED LABOUR 
PRIME MINISTER IN I CAN'T 
REMEMBER BUT EVERYTHING HAS 
SHIFTED AROUND AND WE'RE NOT SO 
ARROGANT THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO TURN 
ANYONE DOWN REGARDLESS OF THEIR 
BACKGROUND IF IF THEY'RE EED 
YONIAN AND BLOND AND CAN IF 
THEY'RE ETONIAN AND BLOND AND CAN 
RUN LONDON GREAT LET THEM GET ON 
WITH THEIR JOB 
BUT ARE THEY POSH 
IF YOU SEE POSH FOLK BLESS THEM 
BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY COOL YOU'RE YOU'RE POSH 
NO I'M FROM GLASGOW 
BUT YOU POSH SPEAK VERY POSH 
THAT'S A CAR YOU 
CAN DRIVE

TO SELL FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS 
TOMORROW BUT YOU COME FROM THAT 
NECK OF THE WOODS 
YES MY PARENTS 
LIVE IN WINDSOR AND WHEN MY CENTRE 
WAS YOUNG SHE WAS BOY CRAZY AND SHE 
THOUGHT SHE'D GET A JOB AT EEDON 
COLLEGE AS A DINNER LADY ETON 
COLLEGE AND SHE WAS TOLD WHATEVER 
YOU DO YOU MUST NOT TALK TO THE 
BOYS SO SHE TURNED THE JOB DOWN 
WARREN YOUR LATEST CREATION IS 
MORE DOWN TO EARTH SYD WOOLSEY 
VETERAN THIEF WAS IT GOOD FUN MAKE 
THE INVISIBLES 
YES IT WAS GOOD 
FUN I HAVEN'T DONE THAT MUCH 
RUNNING AROUND FOR TWENTY ODD YEARS OR 
SO SO IT WAS TOUGH BUT IT WAS 
GREAT FUN 
IT LOOKS FUN IN THIS 
CLIP YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE YOU 
BECAUSE IT'S DARK BUT YOU ARE 
DOING A BIT OF RUNNING MOBILE MOBILE OH HI MUM ME AND 
THE OTHERS ARE DOING A BIT OF A 
JOG JOG SORRY LOVE CAN YOU HANG ON 
SO NOW IT'S MY FAULT DOG RESIST 
NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY 
YOU'VE COME LONG WAY FROM YOUR 
ROLE IN A CLOCKWORK ORANGE WAS 
STANLEY KUBRICK AS OBSESSED AS 
PEOPLE DESCRIBE HIM WHAT IS YOUR 
ANGLE ON IT 
HE WAS OBSESSED AND A 
BIT OF A MEING LA MANIAC IN SOME 
WAYS BUT I HAD A GOOD TIME WORKING 
WITH HEM ALTHOUGH IT TOOK A YEAR 
IT'S NOT UNTIL YOU GO ON TO WORK ON 
SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU REALISE IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN A SHORTER 
TIME 
I DIDN'T WORK FOR A YEAR TIME AFTER THAT BECAUSE EVERYBODY 
THOUGHT I'D DIED AND IT WASN'T 
RELEASED FOR SIX MONTHS L. DID HAVE 
A GOOD TIME WORKING WITH HIM 
ALTHOUGH HE WAS IN SANE LIKE MOST 
EDITORS ARE 
HERE ON THE ONE SHOW WE EMPLOY 
PROFILING TECHNIQUES THAT WOULD 
SHAME MANY POLICE FORCE WE SENT 
OUR CHIEF ART INVESTIGATOR TO 
CARDIFF TO SEE IF WHAT IS ON YOUR 
WALL REVEALS YOUR CHARACTER TRAITS 
I HAVE ARRANGED A PRIVATE VIEWING 
FROM THE HOME OF ONE ART VIEWER 
KAREN SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED FOR TWENTY FOUR 
YEARS AND IS A MUM OF FOUR A 
FORMER NURSE THESE DAYS SHE WORKS 
AS A REGISTERED CHILDMINDER LOOKING 
AFTER TEN CHILDREN FOR THE SAKE OF 
HER SANITY I HOPE NOT AT THE SAME 
TIME I HAVE ASKED OUR DOCTOR TO 
LOOK AT FOUR OF HER FAVOURITE 
PICTURES HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING 
ABOUT KAREN BUT HE RECKONS HE CAN 
WORK OUT A PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 
JUST BY LOOKING AT HER ARTWORK 
LET'S SEE IF HE'S TRUE TO HIS WORD 
FIRST UP IS A PRINT OF A PAINTING 
CALLED THE OLD FARMER BY WELL KNOWN 
WELSH ARTIST KIFFIN WILLIAMS WHAT 
DO YOU MAKE OF THE FIRST ONE WE WE CAN SEE IT'S A CARTOON FIRST OF 
ALL SO A SENSE OF HUMOUR THERE 
BUT ALSO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF 
NEGATIVITY THERE L. DON'T KNOW IF 
YOU CAN SEE IT IT'S QUITE DIMEMY 
AND DARK IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HE 
HAS BEEN AXED FROM BEHIND ALTHOUGH 
HE IS HOLDING IT SO I CAN SAY 
SOMEONE WITH A DARK SENSE OF HUMOUR 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THESE THIS 
PAIR ARE BY BRITISH ARTIST SAM TOFT 
SHE PICKED THESE UP IN WELL KNOWN 
SWEDISH STORE SHORT OF A FIVER 
IT'S MAINSTREAM ART IT'S QUITE 
POPULAR THE BIG DIFFERENCE HERE IS 
IT'S VERY FEMININE IMAGE SO 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO IS 
A WOMAN 
THE LAST ONE HERE IT'S A 
SHIMMERY SORT OF THING GOING ON WE DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE FINAL 
PAINTING OR THE ARTIST BUT 
APPARENTLY IT'S DANISH AUTHOR HANS 
CHRISTIAN ANDERSON AND SOME OF HIS 
CHARACTERS 
WE CAN SEE FANTASY AN CHARACTERS IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS 
CARTOONS SO A SENSE OF HUMOUR IS 
VERY IMPORTANT BUT GENERALLY 
SPEAKING IMAGINATION IS VERY 
IMPORTANT SO I THINK IT'S STILL 
QUITE A FEMININE IMAGE SO TAKEN 
THE FOUR PICTURES COMBINED WE HAVE 
SOMEBODY WHO IS QUITE CHILD LIKE 
SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY MOODY ALMOST 
TEMPERAMENTAL WE CAN SEE THAT IN 
ALL PICTURES ESPECIALLY THIS ONE 
THERE'S BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE 
EMOTIONS COMBINED AND WE CAN ALSO 
SAY IT'S PROBABLY A WOMAN I WOULD 
SAY A YOUNG WOMAN PROBABLY EARLY 
OR MID TWENTIES THAT WOULD BE MY 
PREDICTION 
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY PREDICTION TO FIND OUT IF THOMAS IS AS GOOD AS 
HE THINKS HE IS TIME TO PAY KAREN 
A VISIT AT HOME 
HI PHIL THIS IS DOCTOR TOMAS HELLO HELLO DO COME IN THANK YOU 
RIGHT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A LOOK 
AT YOUR ARTWORK AND DOCTOR THOMAS HAS 
DONE A PROFILE ON YOU TELL US WHY 
YOU LIKE YOUR PICTURES 
ON MY FORTIETH 
BIRTHDAY I DECIDED TO TOODLE OFF 
AND GO TO MY FIRST EVER ART 
EXHIBITION AND HAVE A LOOK FOR 
SOMETHING FOR ME AND THE FIRST ONE 
I SAW WAS THE OLD FARMER WHICH 
REMINDED ME OF MY OLD GRANDPA L. 
JUST THOUGHT HE WAS LOVELY 
TELL US 
ABOUT THE TWO LARGER LADIES 
I LIKE 
THE COLOURS AND I LIKE THE 
SIMPLICITY OF THEM BUT I JUST 
THINK THEY'VE GOT A STORY TO TELL 
TELL US ABOUT THE THIRD ONE WHICH 
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IT'S SORT 
OF BRIGHT SHIMMERY ALMOST A BIT 
DREAM LIKE 
THAT ONE HAS BEEN DREAM LIKE AROUND FOR A BIT LONGER WE BOUGHT 
THAT ONE MUST BE TWENTY YEARS AGO NOW 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS MAKING MONEY 
SELLING THEM ON THE DOORSTEP AND I 
JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM TOMAS TOMAS LET'S SEE HOW WE'RE DOING 
BASICALLY I THOUGHT THE PICTURES 
BELONGED TO A WOMAN IN HER EARLY 
TWENTIES OR MID TWENTIES VERY EXTRAVERTED 
IS INTERESTED IN PEOPLE MORE IN 
PEOPLE THAN IN ART L. ALSO THOUGHT 
IT WAS SOMEBODY WITH AL DARK SENSE 
OF HUMOUR QUITE SORT OF SARCASTIC 
AND IRONIC THOUGHT THEY BELONGED 
TO SOMEBODY WHO WAS TEMPERAMENTAL 
A STRONG CHARACTER AND A LITTLE BIT 
MOODY 
YES MY HUSBAND WOULD AGREE MOODY WITH YOU ON THAT ONE YES 
DEFINITELY AND SARCASTIC AND 
MOODY I WOULD SAY THAT IS FAIRLY 
ACCURATE 
THE BIT I GOT WRONG IS I ACCURATE THOUGHT THE PICTURE BELONGED TO 
SOMEBODY WHO WAS VERY DREAMY AND 
IMAGINATIVE AND NOT VERY DOWN TO 
EARTH MEETING YOU I THINK YOU'RE 
VERY DOWN TO TO EARTH 
HOW DO YOU 
THINK HE GOT ON 
HE DEFINITELY GOT 
THE BIT ABOUT ME BEING DREAMMY AND 
TRANQUIL WRONG BUT NOT TOO BAD AT 
ALL I HAVE TO SAY L. AM DEFINITELY 
A PEOPLE PERSON HE GOT THAT RIGHT 
DOCTOR WELL DONE MATE ANOTHER 
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
