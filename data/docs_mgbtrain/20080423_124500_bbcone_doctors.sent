WHAT YOU GOT HER I GAVE HER MYSELF BODY AND SOUL TWENTY FIVE YEARS WON'T THAT DO 
I BELIEVE IT'S CUSTOMARY TO RETURN THE FAVOUR SIR 
MAKE SURE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE MARITAL SUICIDE 
MY FATHER USUALLY PRESENTS MY MOTHER WITH SOME JEWELLERY ON SIGNATURE ANNIVERSARIES 
I'LL BET HE DOES 
IT'S ALL VERY WELL BUT I CAN HARDLY JUST POP OUT TO THE SHOPS WHEN WE'VE GOT A BABY TO FIND 
I'LL JUST HAVE TO HOPE MRS. RUGG IS APPRECIATIVE OF THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
SHE SEEM ALL RIGHT TO YOU 
HARD TO SAY I HAVEN'T SEEN HER FOR SIX MONTHS 
JOIN THE CLUB OVERSEAS TOUR 
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THAT'S MY BUSINESS 
TOUGH BEING AWAY FROM HOME IF YOU CAN CALL IT HOME SHE MOVED IN WHILE I WAS AWAY 
I NEVER EVEN SAW THE HOUSE UNTIL THIS MORNING 
EIGHTEEN MONTHS ME AND HER BUT WITH THE JOB I'VE BEEN HERE FOR WHAT 
A COUPLE OF THOSE 
WE ONLY GOT MARRIED THREE WEEKS BEFORE I WENT BACK YOU KNOW WHEN WE FOUND OUT ABOUT DAVID 
SO YOU ONLY GOT BACK THIS MORNING I SAID I'VE BEEN AWAY FOR SIX MONTHS 
SEEING HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME WAS SOME HOMECOMING I CAN TELL YOU 
IT WAS LIKE LOOKING INTO MY OWN FACE 
ANYWAY HE'S OUT OF NAPPIES SO BYE 
LETHERBRIDGE POLICE HAVE MOUNTED A HUGE SEARCH OPERATION 
IN THEIR EFFORTS TO FIND KIDNAPPED BABY ALEXANDER WALKER 
A SPOKESMAN FOR 
ENHANCED FOOTAGE WHAT'S SHE GOT IN HER HAND 
LOOK SHE WALKS IN SHE'S GOT IT 
WALKS BACK OUT AGAIN AND IT'S GONE 
A BOOK I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT'S CHOCOLATES SO SHE'S VISITING 
EXCEPT ALL THE VISITORS HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR CHECK IT OUT 
FIND OUT IF A MYSTERY BOX OF CHOCOLATES HAS TURNED UP THIS MORNING 
SHALL I RING THE HOSPITAL THEN MA'AM 
GOOD IDEA 
THIS IS DOCTOR CLAY FROM THE MILL HEALTH CENTRE

OH RIGHT O. K. I SEE 
MY MISTAKE THANK YOU BYE 
DOCTOR CLAY 
FINALLY I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THROUGH FOR AGES WHO IS THIS 
VERY FUNNY YOU KNOW THAT PATIENT THIS MORNING THE ONE WITH THE BABY 
GREAT MINDS 
FROM THE C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE POLICE HAVE NARROWED THEIR ENQUIRIES TO THREE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
TWO MEN AND ONE WOMAN AND HAVE ISSUED AN APPEAL FOR THEM TO COME FORWARD 
IF ANYONE HAS INFORMATION 
COULD BE HER IT'S HARD TO TELL NOT EXACTLY HIGH DEFINITION IS IT 
VERY HELPFUL 
THE CHOCOLATES WERE DROPPED OFF AT RECEPTION FOR SOME OF THE NURSES BUT NO ONE KNOWS WHO BY 
SHE DIDN'T LEAVE WITH TWO BABIES SO IF THAT IS YOUR KIDNAPPER YOU'RE STILL A BABY DOWN 
I KNOW IT'S A RED HERRING ARE YOU SURE WHAT TIME YOU SAW SUSIE THIS MORNING 
THIS WOMAN WAS ONLY ON THE UNIT FOR LESS THAN FOUR MINUTES 
LONG ENOUGH TO STEAL A BABY 
LOOK ALEXANDER'S ROOM IS OVER HERE 
YOU'VE GOT TO WALK ALL THE WAY THROUGH THERE TO GET TO IT BIT RISKY 
ONLY BABY LEFT UNATTENDED 
NOT QUITE THIS ONE WAS CLOSER AND THE MOTHER WAS OUT FOR THE COUNT AFTER A CAESAREAN 
SLEPT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING APPARENTLY WRONG COLOUR LEONA THOMAS 
WHITE WRONG SEX THEN MAYBE SHE WANTED A BOY 
PHIL LOWTHER WAS DESPERATE FOR A SON SUSIE TOLD ME THIS MORNING 
I GOT THE IMPRESSION HE ONLY MARRIED HER BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT 
BUT YOU STILL SAW HER HALF AN HOUR BEFORE 
I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE HER ALIBI DO YOU REMEMBER THE ADDRESS 
KIMBERLEY ROAD TWENTY ONE MRS. LOWTHER 
SHE WAS ON MY CURTAIN TWITCHER LIST 
DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE BABY 
YES BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY ALL BECAME INDISTINGUISHABLE

HE'S A POLICE OFFICER IT'S HIS JOB TO BE OBSERVANT 
IF THIS TURNS OUT THE SAME BABY I'M COMING SHE'S MY PATIENT AND IF SHE IS UNSTABLE 
COME ON THEN YOU'LL BE MORE USE TO ME THAN HIM 
HELP YOURSELF 
YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU THINK OUR DAVID IS THAT BABY NICKED FROM THE HOSPITAL
