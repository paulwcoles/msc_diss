CRUCIBLE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE JUST 
A MASTER MARK SELBY YOU WILL 
REMEMBER HIS RON TO THE FINAL LAST

WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE THEN YOU

PUT JOHN PLAY BETTER L. LOST IN THE 
FIRST FINAL L. WAS DRAINED FROM THE 
PREVIOUS TWO MATCHES HE PLAYED

DAYS 
JOHN HIGGINS WINS THE WORLD DAYS CHAMPIONSHIP 
TO GET THE MASTERS CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL ON MY DEBUT WAS A DREAM COME 
TRUE TO PICK THE TROPHY UP WAS 
AMAZING THE SECOND SESSION WAS 
SOME OF THE BEST SNOOKER I HAVE 
EVER PLAYED 
WHAT A WAY TO WIN YOUR 
FIRST MAJOR TOURNAMENT ABSOLUTELY 
BRILLIANT FOR MARK SELBY GETTING GETTING TO THE WELSH OPEN AFTER A MASTERS 
TO PLAY RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IN THE 
FINAL WAS TERRIFIC L. DON'T THING I 
PLAYED OUTSTANDING SNOOKER IN THE 
FINAL BUT I DUG IN AND GRITTED MY 
TEETH AND JUST TO THE WAY L. WAS EIGHT 
FIVE DOWN BUT KEPT DIGGING AWAY AND 
CAME THROUGH THE MATCH WHICH WAS 
GREAT 
PLEASE PUT YOUR HANDS GREAT TOGETHER FOR MARK SELBY WELSH OPEN 
CHAMPION 
THIS YEAR I SAID TO MY CHAMPION GOAL TO FINISH IN THE TOP EIGHT L. 
HAVE WON TWO MAJOR TITLES AND THEN 
GUARANTEED TO BE IN THE TOP EIGHT 
SO I HAVE TO SET MY SIGHTS HIGHER 
YOUR COMMENTATORS ARE DENNIS TAYLOR 
AND NEAL FOULDS 
MARK KING PLAYED THAT 
AS IF HE DIDN'T FANCY THE POT THE 
RED HAS CREPT OVER THE TOP LEFT 
THAT IS MARK SELBY'S FIRST POT IN 
THE MATCH 
THIS IS A TOUGH CHANCE TO WIN THE 
FRAME BUT A YEAR AGO WE SAW HIM 
PINCH FRAMES LIKE THIS THROUGHOUT 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
HE HAS LEFT THE 
ANGLE TO GET ON TO THE TWO REDS 
HE HAD TO MAKE SURE HE DIDN'T 
SNOOKER HIMSELF WITH THE YELLOW 
WELL JUDGED 
THAT HAS GONE TOO FAR HE WAS 
TRYING 
TO DROP ON THE GREEN 
IN BETWEEN THE YELLOW AND RED 
IT ISN'T BAD HE THROWS THE CHALK 
AND THE AIR THAT TELLS YOU HE 
NEEDS HELP HERE THE EXTENSION ON 
THE SPIDER TO BRIDGE OVER THE 
YELLOW A FRACTION EITHER WAY IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN O. K. HE CAN ONLY 
ROLL THIS IN NOW HE CAN'T GET GOOD 
POSITION 
HE IS ASKING FOR THE EXTENDED 
SPIDER L. AM NOT SURE IF THEY EVEN 
MAKE ONE HE MAY HAVE TO PUT ONE ON 
HIMSELF 
THEY HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER HIMSELF THE TABLE THESE DAYS THE JUST THE 
THUMB LEICESTER HAVING A CRACK WITH 
EIRIAN WILLIAMS THE FORMER 
POLICEMAN FROM SOUTH WALES THE 
JESTER FROM LEICESTER 
IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO SEE THE SHOT 
FROM THIS FAR AWAY EVEN IF YOU 
WHAT TALK LIKE MARK EVEN IF YOU 
ARE TALL 
THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD EFFORT IT 
GIVES HIMSELF A CHANCE TO POT THE 
YELLOW AND THEN IT WILL BE REPLACED 
ON ITS SPOT CAN HE GET THE WHITE 
AWAY FROM THE CUSHION THAT IS WHY 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE GREEN NOW IF 
THE YELLOW HAD BEEN STRAIGHTER IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THIS IS A 
KEY SHOT IN THE OPENING FRAME 
IT IS A TOUGH YELLOW THIS IS 
ALMOST THIRTY TWO MINUTES SO FAR 
WHAT A SHOT JUST A PITY HE HAS 
FINISHED AWKWARD ON THE GREEN A 
GREAT BELOW HE HAS SO MUCH OF A 
BUBBLE OF CONFIDENCE FROM BREAK 
LIKE THIS THIS BREAK HAS BEEN 
GOING ALMOST SEVEN MINUTES 
ANOTHER GREAT SHOT IT MISSES THE 
BLACK YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS YOUNG 
MAN IS THE MOST EXCITING ON THE 
TOUR THIS IS A NATURAL BROWN TO 
BLUE HE COULD ALMOST PLAY THIS 
PLAIN BALL HE IS HEADING DOWN 
TOWARDS THE BLUE ALL RIGHT IT IT MIGHT GO TO THE MIDDLE POCKET 
WITHOUT THE SIDE 
THE WAY HE WAS CUEING HE WAS GOING 
TO NEED A LONGER BELIEVE LONGER 
BLUE 
THAT WAS THE BEST HE COULD DO THERE 
JUST HAVING A PRACTICE RUN TO SEE 
IF HE CAN PUSH 
THE CUE 
THROUGH HE 
IS FULLY STRETCHED HERE 
ANOTHER BRILLIANT SHOT HE HAS 
PLAYED FIVE OUTSTANDING BREAKS IN 
THIS SHOT THIS WOULD BE SOME 
CLEARANCE 
WHAT A PERFORMANCE THIS IS BECAUSE 
MARK KING WAS ODDS ON TO TAKE THE 
OPENING FRAME AND SUDDENLY MARK 
SELBY HAS PRODUCED A CLEARANCE BIKE 
THIS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT WHAT A 
CLEARANCE A BREAK OF FIFTY FIVE GIVES THE 
FRAME TO MARK SELBY 
COUPLE OF EASY REDS AND ONE THAT IS 
DIFFICULT NEAR THE RIGHT SIDE 
CUSHION 
HE'S GOT A PRETTY GOOD ANGLE ON THE 
BLUE HE MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO 
DEVELOP THIS RED THAT IS SAFER HE 
CAN DROP IN BEHIND IT CERTAINLY 
DEAL THE RED TO THE LEFT OF THE 
BROWN THE OTHER RED THAT WASN'T 
THE CORRECT ANGLE TO DROP BEHIND 
THE RED ANY MORE PACE HE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN COMING THE WRONG SIDE OF 
IT 
HAS HE GOT THE CORRECT ANGLE ON THE 
OTHER AND TO MOVE THE RED YEAR 
LOW YELLOW GOT TO MAKE SURE HE 
GETS THE CANNON CORRECT AND PUSH IT 
TOWARDS THE CORNER POCKET TOO HARD TOO MUCH PACE ON THAT 
THAT WAS A WEEK'S SAFETY SHOT NO 
THOUGHT HE MAY HAVE DONE MORE WITH 
THAT WEEK SAFETY SHOT 
THAT WAS THE DREADED DOUBLE KISS 
OR BECAUSE HE TRIED TO LAND BEHIND 
THE BLACK WITH THE CUE BALL 
MAKING SURE THE OBJECT BALL WAS 
SAFE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
THAT WAS A DOUBLE KISS THAT WILL 
PROVE COSTLY I THINK IF THE 
DOUBLE KISS IS ON IT IS ON IT IS 
ONE OF THOSE THAT YOU CANNOT REALLY 
AVOID IT IS REAL CHANCE FOR MARK 
SELBY MARKING I'M NOT SURE HE 
HAS SAT HAVE YET SO WINNING THIS 
FRAME WOULD BE A BIG HELP HE HAS A 
CHANCES TO WIN THIS ONE BUT IS 
STILL A FEW BEHIND ON THE COLOURS 
AND THE GREEN NOT ALL THAT 
DIFFICULT L. SAY THAT BECAUSE HE IS 
A LEFT HANDER SO IT IS THE CORRECT 
SIDE OF THE TABLE FOR HIM 
HE'S LOOKING TO SEE IF HE CAN NEED 
THE GREEN INTO THE LEFT MIDDLE 
POCKET AS WE LOOK AT IT THE ANGLE 
WOULD HAVE TO BE VERY PRECISE TO 
DROP ON IT FOR THE MIDDLE THAT IS 
A POOR SHOT L. THINK HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN BETTER COMING THIS SIDE OF THE 
GREEN BEEN LEFT HANDED IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN EASIER HE'S NOT LOOKING 
AT THE DOUBLE IS HE L. THINK HE IS 
THERE IS AN EASY CLIP OFF THE GREEN 
TO GET UP BEHIND THE BACK HE WANTS 
TO TAKE THE DOUBLE ON AND THIS 
WOULD GIVE HIM THE FRAME 
THIS GREEN IS TRAVELLING HE HAS 
GOT THE CUE BALL RIGHT AND THE 
GREEN IF IT STOPS IN TIME IT WILL 
BE THE SNOOKER THAT'S NOT BAD 
YOU ALWAYS NEED A BIT OF GOOD 
FORTUNE WHEN YOU ARE ESCAPING FROM 
A SNOOKER LIKE THIS YOU ONE OF THE 
SURE WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO GO 
YOU ARE NEVER SURE HE WILL SETTLE 
FOR THAT GETTING THE SNOOKER 
I WONDER IF HE HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH 
TO MAKE IT AWKWARD IT IS A NARROW 
POTTING ANGLE INTO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET IT MAY BE EASIER IF THE CUE 
BALL IS IN LINE WITH THE SHOT 
LEADS UP TO THE PINK TO REALLY 
SETTLED HIS NERVES THAT LOOKS O. K. 
HE CLEARS FROM GREEN TO PINK TO WIN 
THE SECOND FRAME 
THE PLAYERS ARE REFRESHED AND NICE 
CUP OF TEA OR COFFEE AT THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL THE FIRST FOUR 
FRAMES WERE VERY TOUGH 
CLEVER SHOT IF THIS RED GOES IN 
THE CHANCE OF GETTING ON THE PINK 
HE WASN'T GOING TO LEAVE ANYTHING HE HAS MESS THAT TOOK QUITE BADLY 
IT'S THE RED THAT'S GONE DOWN THE 
TABLE THE CUE BALL DIDN'T EVEN 
MAKE THE BAULK LINE SO THAT WAS A 
TERRIBLE SAFETY SHOT 
THE RED TO THE LEFT OF THE BLACK 
SPOT IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM WHEN 
THE BLACK IS POTTED AND RE SPOTTED 
I THINK IT WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE 
INTO THE RIGHT CORNER HE HAS AN 
ANGLE TO GO INTO THE REDS IF HE 
WANTS TO DEVELOP QUITE A FEW 
HE MAY HAVE TO PLAY FOR THE BLUE 
THIS TIME YES HE CAN POT THIS AND 
SWING IT AROUND THE ANGLES AND GET 
TO THE BLUE IF THE PINK GOES HE 
WILL BE ALL RIGHT YOU HAVE TO POT 
THE RED THOUGH NEITHER PLAYER 
REALLY HAS SLIPPED INTO TOP GEAR 
HE PLAYED ON THE RED HE WAS CLOSEST 
TO WITH THE CUE BALL HE IS NOT ON 
IT AS HE WOULD LIKE HE CAN STILL 
GET TO IT BUT IT'S NOT VERY NICE 
SHOT HE COULD MISS IT IT IS A 
TRICKY ANGLE AND HE HAS BEEN LEFT 
WITH NO OPTION BUT TO PLAY THIS 
THAT IS DISAPPOINTING HE HAS JUST 
PUNCHED THE TABLE 
THAT WAS A FAIR 
OLD PUNCH HE DID GIVE THE TABLE I I ALWAYS THINK A FIGHT BETWEEN A 
SNOOKER PLAYER AND A SNOOKER TABLE 
THERE IS ONLY ONE WINNER 
HE HAS 
HAD A FIGHT BEFORE AGAINST QUINTEN 
HANN THEY WENT INTO THE RING 
THAT WENT TOO FAR WITH THE CUE BALL 
HE ISN'T ON THE RED HE WANTED THE 
ONE BELOW AND TO THE RIGHT THE ONE 
CLOSEST THEY GO THE ONE IN THE 
CENTRE OF THREE REDS IN LINE 
THERE IS RED THAT POTS BUT IT IS 
MIGHTY CLOSE NOT A SHOT YOU WANT 
TO PLAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE SURE 
WHERE THE CUE BALL WILL GO 
THAT IS A GREAT SHOT FABULOUS 
THAT IS THE SECOND REALLY AWKWARD 
PLANT HE HAS PLAYED BEING CLOSE TO 
THE FIRST RED MADE IT AND TRICKY 
SHOT DENNIS 
IT IS A TITLE YOU WOULDN'T REALLY 
WANT THE GREATEST PLANT MAKER THE 
GAME HAS EVER SEEN IT DOESN'T ROLL 
OFF THE TONGUE BUT THEY DO COME IN 
HANDY HE HAS BROKEN DOWN 
POSITIONALLY A COUPLE OF TIMES IN 
THE MATCH AND HAS HAD PLANT TO GET HIM OUT OF TROUBLE 
HE IS STILL BUILDING THIS BREAK 
QUITE NICELY AFTER THE PLANT THE 
EARLY ON WHERE HE HAD BEEN OUT OF 
POSITION SLIGHTLY HE WOULD LIKE TO 
BE STRAIGHT ON THE BLUE TO JUST 
ROLL BEHIND THE RED IT ISN'T THE 
BEST OF ANGLES 
HE HAS GONE ASTRAY I THINK THIS IS 
END OF BREAK 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE ONE TO 
KNOCKIN HE WASN'T CAREER TO LEAVE 
A GREAT DEAL BUT WITH THE KISS ON 
THE BLACK LOOK WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
IF THE PLAYER WAS TO PLAY THE SHOT 
BEFORE THE REFEREE HAD THE BALL BE 
POTTED IT IS A FOUL RE SPOTTED 
THIS IS A MUCH GO FRAME THE 
INTERVAL HAS CHANGED THINGS AROUND 
A MUCH QUICKER FRAME IT HAS BEEN 
JUST OVER TWELVE MINUTES 
THAT IS ENOUGH A BREAK OF FORTY FIVE AND 
THEN TWENTY NINE WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO 
GIVE 
MARK SELBY THIS FRAME MARK SELBY LEADS BY THREE FRAMES TO TWO MARK SELBY HAS ALWAYS LED IN THIS 
MATCH THOUGHT HE SPREAD HIS GAME 
UP A LITTLE IN THE LAST FRAME 
WINNING IT QUITE QUICKLY SPREAD 
HIS GAME UP SPED 
MARK NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL PLAYING 
OFF THE SIDE OF THE PACK HE 
DOESN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE REDS TO 
FIRMLY 
HE JUST SAID THE WORD SWEET 
WRAPPERS THERE I'M NOT SURE WHAT 
THAT MEANS IN RELATION TO SNOOKER 
WELL WILLIE THORNE IS A WRAPPER 
WHEN HE SINGS SINGS SNOOKER LOOPY 
I MARSHALL BUT I'M NOT SURE 
SOMEBODY COULD HAVE RUSTLING ONE IN 
THE AUDIENCE 
I HAVE HAD PLENTY OF THINGS SAID 
AFTER MISSING A BALL BUT NOT THAT 
A LOT WORSE 
THIS TIME IT IS EVEN WORSE BECAUSE 
HE HAS LEFT THE RED TO THE LEFT 
CENTRE 
I WAS GOING TO SAY IT IS COME TO 
THE POINT WHERE MARK KING'S 
CONCENTRATION WILL BE TESTED BUT 
HOW THAT DIDN'T GO IN I DON'T KNOW 
I DIDN'T DETECT A KICK IT LOOKED 
TO BE GOING IN BUT JUST HIT THE 
NEAR JAW MARK KING CAN'T BELIEVE 
HE IS BACK SO QUICKLY 
BOTH KNEES BENT MARK KING IT 
WON'T BE IN THE COACHING MANUAL 
BUT IT HAS DONE NO HARM OVER THE 
YEARS 
HE IS PLAYING WELL CERTAINLY AN 
IMPROVED PLAYER IN THE LAST THREE 
OR FOUR YEARS HE PLAYS A TOUGH 
GAME NOW 
HE IS TO FORCE 
A BIT OF AN ANGLE 
HE DID 
WELL WITH THAT CAN HOLD THIS WHITE 
HE CAN CANNON INTO THE BUNCH HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL HE DOES NOT SLIP OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE REDS HE IS O. K. HE'S ON A RED FOR THE MIDDLE POCKET 
A FEW REDS WILL POT HERE STILL 
CERTAINLY RED WILL POT INTO THE 
SAME POCKET AS THE BLACK IF HE 
GETS IN BEHIND IT ALSO RED 
CLOSEST TO THE PINK SPOT WILL GO TO 
THE LEFT CENTRE IT HAS BEEN THERE 
FOR A WHILE YOU CAN SEE THE BLACK 
IS VIRTUALLY STRAIGHT 
THAT IS THE OTHER RED THAT WOULD 
JUST POT HE IS LOOKING AT IT 
SOMETIMES IT IS WORTH LOOKING FROM 
BEHIND THE POCKET THAT HAS THE 
ANGLE WE COULD SEE 
SO CLOSING OUT THE FRAME HE STILL 
HAS WORK TO DO BUT I THINK HE HAS 
GOT THROUGH LOT OF HARD WORK 
HE HAS A COUPLE MORE OPTIONS 
ALTHOUGH THAT IS NOT A GOOD SHOT 
HE GOT INTO THE CUE BALL LITTLE 
TOO MUCH MAYBE THERE IS SOME LIFE 
IN THE FRAME YET WONDER IF HE 
WENT TO LOW ON THE CUE BALL BECAUSE 
IT DID NOT COME OFF AT THE ANGLE HE 
WANTED 
GREATER RECOVERY GREAT SHOT 
GREAT 
GOOD CUEING AGAIN SO IMPRESSIVE 
BREAK SO FAR THOUGHT HE WAS 
STRUGGLING WITH HIS CONCENTRATION 
SINCE THE INTERVAL BUT HE HAS GOT 
GOING HERE 
HE IS JUST A COUPLE OF SHOTS AWAY 
FROM SECURING THE FRAME THAT WAS 
FRAME BALL 
ONCE HE HAS POTTED THIS HE MIGHT 
THINK ABOUT SOMETHING EVEN BETTER 
THE BREAK IS EIGHTY TEN REDS AND TEN 
BLACKS HE COULD MAKE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN NOW 
THE FRAME IS SAFE IT WILL BE ON 
HIS MIND 
HE HAS A TOP BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX THAT WAS 
MADE IN THE U. K. CHAMPIONSHIP IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE FROM THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE ARENA 
QUIET PLEASE 
THERE IS ONE VERY DIFFICULT RED ON 
THE SIDE CUSHION BUT THIS IS A 
GREAT EFFORT FROM MARK KING 
AS A 
LEFT HANDER HE COULD GET TO THAT 
RED AT LEAST 
I THINK HE IS O. K. I THINK HE MIGHT 
TRY TO DEVELOP IT 
IF HE DOES HE 
HASN'T GOT THE SHOT ON THE OTHER 
RED TO GET ON THE BLACK SEE WHERE 
HE IS PUTTING THE CUE THERE IS 
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IF HE FINISHES 
ON THAT ONE THAT IS NEAR THE MIDDLE 
POCKET IN SUCH A WAY HE MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO CANNON THE OTHER ONE OUT 
AND STILL COME THROUGH FOR THE 
BLACK IF IT WASN'T ME I WOULD 
PLAY ON THE RED NEAR THE POCKET L. 
THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT SHOT 
DENNIS 
WHAT IS THE ANGLE LIKE HE DENNIS CANNOT MOVE THE OTHER RED HE WILL 
HAVE TO GET A GOOD ANGLE ON THE 
BLACK TO TRY AND GET BACK TO IT IT 
WOULD BE SOME MAXIMUM BREAK IF HE 
COULD MAKE IT 
IF THIS GOES FAR ENOUGH UP THE 
TABLE HE'S GOT THE ANGLE TO MAYBE 
PLAY IN BEHIND THE RED AND THAT 
MIGHT SUIT HIM AS LEFT HANDED 
PLAYER HE IS KEEPING VERY COMPOSED 
GOOD SHOT EXCELLENT SHOT DENNIS 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE STRAIGHT 
THERE IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOR THE MAXIMUM 
PLUS TEN THOUSAND FOR THE HIGHEST BREAK 
HE HAS A SLIGHT ANGLE HE MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO POT IT AND GET THE WHITE A 
LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM THE CUSHION 
IT WASN'T TO BE A BRILLIANT ONE HUNDRED TWELVE A 
MASSIVE PAY DAY FOR MARK KING SO 
THE BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWELVE AND THE MATCH IS 
THREE TO THREE TERRIFIC DOUBLE 
HE IS TERRIFIC AT PICKING OUT 
DIFFICULT PLANTS HE IS GOOD AT 
DOUBLES 
IT IS STARTING TO PICK UP VERY 
NICELY THIS MATCH TERRIFIC ONE HUNDRED TWELVE 
BREAK FROM MARK KING IN THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME IT WAS A POSSIBLE 
MAXIMUM BUT IT WAS HIS FIFTY FOURTH 
CENTURY BREAKS HE DOES NOT MAKE A 
LOT OF CENTURIES HE HAS BEEN A 
PROFESSIONAL FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS 
HE PLAYED THAT WELL JUST THE ONE 
RED HE COULD PLAY ON HE WAS 
GETTING CLOSE TO IT SO HE JUDGED 
IT QUITE NICELY HE HAS THE ANGLE 
IF HE WANTS TO GO OFF THE CUSHION 
THE SIX REDS IN THE PYRAMID WE 
HAVE SEEN IT ALREADY IN THIS MATCH 
THE REDS GOING LIKE THAT HE IS NOT 
GUARANTEED TO SPREAD THEM VERY WELL 
THAT IS GOOD EFFORT 
HE REALLY GOT INTO THAT THAT IS A 
GOOD SHOT 
SINCE THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
THIS MATCH HAS PICKED UP BOTH 
PLAYERS LOOKING BETTER MAYBE THE 
BREAK FOR MARK KING IN THE PREVIOUS 
FRAME HAS INSPIRED MARK SELBY HE HAS JUST GONE FAR ENOUGH 
JUST A WEE BIT SHORT AGAIN BUT A 
PRETTY GOOD SHOT HE CAN GET TO THE 
RED NEAREST THE BLACK 
THERE IS STILL THE RED TO THE LEFT 
OF THE PINK AVAILABLE 
IT IS DEVELOPING INTO A FINE MATCH 
THIS 
MARK KING NEEDS SNOOKERS NOW IF HE 
COMES BACK TO THE TABLE 
A CHANCE FOR QUITE A BIG BREAK HERE 
A TOTAL CLEARANCE ON THE CARDS NO 
TOTAL CLEARANCE THOUGH 
MIND YOU 
IT WAS A FINE SEVENTY SIX ENOUGH TO GIVE 
MARK SELBY THE FRAME HE IS BACK IN 
THE FRAME ON SMALL AT FOUR TO THREE ONCE 
MORE 
IT IS TURNING INTO QUITE A HIGH 
QUALITY MATCH HERE MARK KING WITH 
ONE HUNDRED TWELVE TO GO THREE TO THREE AND MARK SELBY COME 
BACKWARDS SEVENTY SIX TO TAKE THE LEAD AT FOUR 
THREE TWO FRAMES LEFT IN THE SESSION 
HE DIDN'T FANCY THE GREEN HE HAS 
COVERED ALL THE REDS HE GOT THE 
PACE RIGHT 
IT WAS JUDGED WELL BECAUSE HE HAS 
COVERED ALL THE REDS THAT WILL POT 
ONLY A SAFETY SHOT FOR KING FROM 
HERE 
THAT SHOT WENT WRONG HE MISSED A 
URGED DID BADLY L. THINK 
THE RED TO THE LEFT CENTRE IS AN ACUTE ANGLE 
HE COULD ONLY ROLL THIS IN VERY 
SLOWLY JUST MADE IT DIDN'T 
IT 
THAT WAS 
AS HARD AS YOU COULD HIT THAT 
NINE FRAMES TO BE PLAYED IN THIS 
SESSION 
A PRETTY HIGH STANDARD THE FIRST 
FOUR FRAMES WERE TACTICAL BUT MARK 
KING HAS HAD BREAKS OF SIXTY FIFTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED TWELVE 
MARK SELBY HAS HAD A FIFTY FIVE FORTY SIX FORTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX 
A LITTLE STUN SHOT TO LAND ON THE 
RED IN THE SAME POCKET HE HASN'T 
GONE QUITE AS FAR AS HE WOULD HAVE 
LIKE LIKE HE HAS THE CUE 
AWKWARDLY OVER THE TWO REDS HE IS 
INFURIATED HE HASN'T FINISHED DEAD 
ON THIS QUITE ANIMATED ISN'T HE 
WE HAVE SEEN ALL KINDS OF STUFF 
TODAY BUT HE IS PUMPED UP THERE 
IS A BIG MATCH FOR HIM IT IS BIG MATCH FOR HIM 
THAT WORKED OUT WELL I AM NOT SURE 
IF HE KNEW THE GAP WAS THERE FOR 
THE PINK 
IT WAS WELL WORKED OUT 
HE GOT A FLICK ON THE BLACK OR RED 
STRIKING OVER THE RED HE DID WELL 
TO FIND THE GAP 
HE IS GETTING CLOSE TO THE POINT 
WHERE SO WILL BE WELL NEEDS 
SNOOKERS RED COLOUR RED SHOULD 
BE ENOUGH MARK SELBY 
IT IS A MATCH THAT PICKED UP 
CONSIDERABLY SINCE THE FIRST FOUR 
FRAMES WHEN IT WAS TWO TO TWO SO CLOSE 
TO WINNING THE FRAME 
HIS CONCENTRATION IS GOOD I DON'T 
REALLY KNOW WHY HE MISSED THAT 
CAME AS A SURPRISE 
HE IS BOILING OVER THAT ONE HE 
CANNOT BELIEVE HE MISSED THAT PINK 
MARK SELBY CAN POT A RED TO THE 
LEFT CENTRE THE TOP ONE WILL GO 
MARK SELBY MADE A BREAK OF FIFTY FIVE IN 
THE OPENING FRAME WHICH WAS QUITE 
INCREDIBLE THIS WOULD BE EQUALLY 
AS GOOD IF HE COULD CLEAR UP FROM 
THIS POSITION BUT THEY WERE VERY 
DIFFICULT IN THAT OPENING FRAME AND 
HE DID IT 
OVER SCREWED SLIGHTLY MARK KING 
KNOWS HE POSSIBLY HAS SECOND 
CHANCE THE POSITION IS NOT GREAT 
FOR MARK SELBY 
HE CAN SCREW OFF THE SIDE CUSHION 
AND LAY IN BEHIND THE RED WONDER 
IF HE HAS THE NATURAL CANNON ON TO 
THIS PINK AS WELL BUT IT WILL BE 
HARD TO SEE HIM LANDING ON THE RED 
THAT WAY HE IS PLAYING FOR SCREW 
SHOT ACROSS OFF ONE CUSHION IT 
WOULD SEEM IT IS A BEAUTIFUL SHOT 
HE PLAYED THIS AS WELL AS HE COULD HE IS JUST A FRACTION THE WEIGHT OF 
BEEN ON THAT ONE A WAY HE JUST 
CANNOT GET THROUGH TO THE OTHER ONE 
HE CANNOT DO MUCH WITH THE CUE BALL 
HERE 
I AM A LITTLE SURPRISED HE PLAYED 
THAT SHOT THERE IS STILL THIRTY EIGHT POINTS 
THE DIFFERENCE HE HAS NO ON I'M 
QUITE SURPRISED HE POTTED THAT HE 
NEEDS COLOUR COLOUR ON 
HE IS GOING TO TRY AND ROLL THIS IN 
BUT IF HE DOESN'T GET IT HE WILL 
NEED SNOOKERS IN THE FRAME THAT 
WAS AMBITIOUS THE BREAK WAS A TEAM 
THE MOMENT MARK SELBY NEEDS 
SNOOKERS AND DOES NOT GET THEM IT 
WILL BE FOUR TO FOUR 
HE POTTED THE BLUE THAT IS A TRICK 
SHOT AND A HALF ANSWERS ON A 
POSTCARD HOW MANY TIMES AS A 
PLAYER BROKEN OFF AND POTTED THE 
BLUE LIKE THAT L. CAN ONLY EVER IT 
HAPPENING ONCE AND I CANNOT 
REMEMBER WHO DID THIS THAT IS THE 
MOST UNUSUAL BREAK OFF SHOT YOU 
WILL EVER SEE 
THAT WAS PERFECTLY PLAYED AND AN 
EARLY CHANCE FOR MARK SELBY 
HE'S GOT A RED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
PACK SO AM NOT SURE IF HE CAN GET 
ON TO THAT SO I THINK HE WILL HAVE 
TOO MUCH INTO THEM HE LOST THE CUE 
BALL BUT THE BLUE HELPED HIM 
WITHOUT THE BLUE BEING ON ITS SPOT 
THE CUE BALL WAS LOST UP THE TABLE 
A LITTLE BIT FORTUNATE HE DID NOT 
GET INTO THEM WELL 
HE MISSED THAT BY A LONG WAY THE 
FIRST SIGN HE IS FEELING THE 
PRESSURE THAT WAS NOT CLOSE THESE 
ARE THE SHOTS THAT CAN AFFECT YOU 
WHEN IT IS BY THAT MARGIN YOU 
THING HELLO WHAT 
IS WRONG HERE IT IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO TAKE THAT 
OVERNIGHT LEAD EVEN IF IT'S ONLY 
THE ONE FRAME THIS MATCH WILL 
CONTINUE TOMORROW MORNING AT TEN AM 
IS HE ON THE BLUE THAT IS A BIT OF 
GOOD FORTUNE THANKS VERY MUCH 
INDEED HE BOUNCED THAT INTO THE 
PACK 
HAVE NO 
IDEA WHAT WAS GOING 
PACK HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE CUE BALL IT IS O. K. 
BOUNCING AROUND ON THE TABLE AS 
LONG AS YOU DON'T JUMP AND 
INTERVENING BALLS AN INTERVENING 
BALL 
THE BLUE CAN BE POTTED INTO THE 
LEFT CORNER THE BLACK IS IN THE 
CLEAR THE PINK IS O. K. THE PINK 
WILL GO BACK ONTO THE BLUE SPOT 
WHEN HE POTS THIS RED THE HIGHEST 
AVAILABLE SPOT WILL BE THE BLUE 
SPOT SO THE PINK WILL BE ON THERE 
THE REDS ARE NICELY OPEN THIS IS A 
GOOD CHANCE 
THE SECRETS WOULD BE BROKEN IF MARK 
KING WOULD BE SEQUENCE WOULD BE 
BROKEN IF MARK KING WON THIS FRAME 
HE LOOKS REALLY PUMPED UP IT CAN 
LEAD TO PLAYER BOILING OVER BUT 
AT THE MOMENT HE IS IN CONTROL OF 
THIS DEMOTION AND HE IS CUEING WELL 
THIS IS GREAT CHANCE JUST AN INCH TOO FAR THERE 
HE HAS WANTED TO PUT IN A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE HAVING QUALIFIED 
DEFEATING JIMMY WHITE IN THE LAST 
QUALIFYING ROUND TO GET THROUGH TO 
SHEFFIELD IN THE END HE BEAT JIMMY 
WHITE TEN TO THREE WHAT AN ACHIEVEMENT 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF JIMMY WHITE 
HAD QUALIFIED BUT MARKING WAS JUST 
A BIT TOO STRONG FOR HIM MARK 
KING NOT SURE WHAT THE REFEREE 
WERE SAYING THERE 
MAYBE THERE WAS 
A SLIGHT DISTRACTION AND THE 
REFEREE DOESN'T WANT THE PLAYERS TO 
NOTICE SOMEBODY AND HE DID A GOOD 
JOB MARK KING IS DEEP IN 
CONCENTRATION 
OF COURSE THEY'VE GOT THE ARENA 
FOR TO THEMSELVES AT THE MOMENT 
HE'S GOT INTO THIS BUT IT IS O. K. 
THE ADRENALIN IS PUMPING AND HE 
ALMOST OVER SCREWED THAT 
HE HAS 
OVER SCREWED IT BOTH REDS ARE 
TRICKY IN EITHER MIDDLE POCKET 
LITTLE CUTBACKS YOU WOULD THINK HE 
WILL BE O. K. THE ONE TO THE MIDDLE 
WRITER LOOKS O. K. TO ME I THINK IF 
HE HOLDS THAT HE CAN GO ON THE 
BLACK 
HE HAS UNDERHIT THAT SLIGHTLY HE'S 
GOT TO USE THE RED TO THE LEFT OF 
THE BLUE AS A STOPPER IF HE DROPS 
THE BLACK IN HE IS RUNNING FURTHER 
AWAY FROM THE REDS IF HE CAN GET A 
CANNON ON THAT HE WILL BE O. K. THE 
ONE TO THE RIGHT OF THE THREE REDS 
AND BLUE WOULD BE AVAILABLE 
IT IS A DELICATE LITTLE SHOT A 
SOFT SCREW ON TO THE RED HE IS NOT 
PLAYING IT HE TRIED TO GO ALL THE 
WAY ROUND THE TABLE WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED HERE THAT COULD BE AN 
OUTRAGEOUS RUN OF GOOD FORTUNE HOW 
LUCKY IS THAT 
MARK SELBY DOES NOT 
WANT TO COME OUT OF HIS SEAT HE 
CANNOT BELIEVE THAT RESULT 
ELECTED TO TRY AND FORCE IT ALL THE 
WAY AROUND THE ANGLES LOOK WHAT 
HAPPENED WHAT A BIT OF GOOD 
FORTUNE THAT WAS 
IF HE JUST COMES OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF 
THE TABLE IT IS SO EASY TO LEAVE 
ONE ON HE WILL HAVE TO BE VERY 
VERY PRECISE 
HE'S GOING TO DO WELL TO GET OUT OF 
THIS IT'S IF HE IS PLAYING FOR THE 
SINGLE RED EVEN THEN HE WILL NEED 
GOOD FORTUNE THIS WILL BE GOING BACK 
IT ISN'T TOO BAD THE RED KISSING 
THE BLACK HAS GIVEN MARK A POSSIBLE 
POT IT LOOKS AS IF THERE COULD BE 
AN ANGLE TO GO INTO THE REDS AND HE 
DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT 
A BIT FURTHER AWAY FROM THE CUSHION 
AND HE COULD CUES SIDE AND AVOID 
THE CANNON ON THE FOUR REDS HE 
COULD USE SIDE 
HE IS DIGGING DOWN HABIT THE LAST 
THING HE WANTS TO DO IS CANNON THE 
REDS 
IT IS RISKY IT ISN'T A NICE 
SHOT THAT IS FOR CERTAIN HE 
DECIDED NOT TO CUE DOWN ON THE BALL 
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY HE COULD HAVE 
LEFT ONE ON 
HE APPLIED QUITE A BIT 
OF SIDE TO AVOID CAREERING INTO 
THOSE REDS 
HE DOES LIKE A PLANT WE KNOW THAT 
IS IT ON 
THE PLANT IS NOT QUITE ON BUT IT 
COULD BE MADE HE IS PICKING AS 
SPOT ON THE CUSHION WHERE HE WOULD 
KNOCK THE FIRST RED HE PICKED THE 
ANGLE WHERE YOU WOULD POT THE AID 
AND PICK THE SPOT ON THE CUSHION 
YOU WANT TO KNOCK THE RED ON TO 
THE FIRST RED AND LET THERE OTHER 
ONE TAKE CARE OF ITSELF 
A TERRIFIC SHOT SMACK IN THE 
CENTRE OF THE POCKET IT WASN'T A 
GIMME THAT ALL IT HAD TO BE MADE 
HE KNOCKS IN THE PRESSURE BALLS 
DOESN'T HE 
HE SEEMED TO BE THE MAN 
FOR THE PRESSURE SHOT NEAL HE HAS 
PROVED THAT OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF 
SEASONS THAT IS WHY HE'S THE 
PROVISIONAL NUMBER FOUR AND THE 
WORLD IN THE WORLD 
HE IS 
LOOKING TO SCREW THIS BUT HE COULD 
PERHAPS RUN THROUGH HE HAS TO KISS 
THE RED UP EITHER WAY 
IT WAS WORTH THE RISK HE IS ON THE 
BLACK THE BLACK WILL GO ON THE 
PINK SPOT THE HIGHEST AVAILABLE 
HE HAS DONE WELL HE HAS DONE VERY 
WELL BECAUSE THAT WAS VERY THIN 
HE PUT SCREW ON IT AND KILLED THE 
CUE BALL STOPPED IT FROM 
TRAVELLING TOO FAR 
IT IS A BIT OF A REPLICA OF THE 
OPENING FRAME MARK KING LED BY FORTY SEVEN 
POINTS AND MARK SELBY CLEARED UP 
WITH A TERRIFIC FIFTY FIVE BREAK HE MIGHT 
JUST TO THE SAME IN THIS FINAL 
FRAME OF THE SESSION JUST SEEMS 
TO GET BETTER THE MORE PRESSURE 
THAT IS ON THE SHOT MARK KING WAS 
REALLY PUMPED UP FOR THIS AND HE 
WAS GOING ALONG VERY NICELY HE 
LOOKED FAVOURITE TO TAKE AN 
OVERNIGHT LEAD 
HE WAS STRETCHING A BIT IT IS FINE 
THE SIGN OF A GREAT PLAYER SOMEONE 
WHO CAN UP HIS GAME UNCHALLENGED 
WHEN CHALLENGED 
HAS HE OVERSCREWED THAT HE HAS TO 
GET ALL THE WAY UP TO THE BLUE HE 
WILL HAVE TO STRETCH FOR THIS ONE 
HE HAD TO BE VERY PRECISE HE HAS 
UNDERDONE IT SO THIS SIDE 
DECIDING FRAME ISN'T OVER YET AND 
MARK KNOWS IT THE BLUE ISN'T 
STRAIGHTFORWARD BY ANY MEANS IN 
FACT HE MAY EVEN REFUSE IT AND 
PLAY THE SNOOKER 
HE KNOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS 
FINAL FRAME 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO HIT THE KNUCKLE 
IT SPOILED THE CHANCE OF SNOOKER 
HE HAS GOOD CUE BALL BUT WITHOUT 
CATCHING THE MIDDLE POCKET HE WOULD
