HOUSE PRICES IN FIFTEEN YEARS THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH HITS HOMES 
PRICES FELL BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT LAST MONTH AND 
IT'S HARDER TO GET A MORTGAGE 
ALSO ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
POLICE ARE STILL QUESTIONING THE 
MOTHER OF NINE YEAR OLD SHANNON 
MATTHEWS ABOUT CLAIMS SHE FAILED TO 
REVEAL WHAT SHE KNEW ABOUT HER 
DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE 
THE OLYMPIC FLAME ARRIVES IN SAN 
FRANCISCO BUT AFTER THE PROTESTS 
OFFICIALS TALK OF ABANDONING THE 
RELAY ALTOGETHER 
A HERO'S RETURN WE TALK TO THIS 
ROYAL MARINE BACK WITH HIS 
COMRADES FROM AFGHANISTAN 
PRETTY GOOD PRETTY GOOD IT BEATS 
LOOKING AT SAND 
ON B. B. C. LONDON FIVE TEENAGERS ARE 
FOUND GUILTY OF KILLING SIXTEEN YEAR OLD 
SCHOOLBOY KODJO YENGA 
COUNTING THE COST AS THE MONEY 
KEEPS POURING INTO THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
AQUATICS CENTRE 
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO THE SIX 
O'CLOCK NEWS 
THERE'S MORE EVIDENCE OF A SLUMP IN 
THE HOUSING MARKET TONIGHT THE 
BIGGEST MORTGAGE LENDER THE HALIFAX 
SAYS HOUSE PRICES FELL BY AN 
AVERAGE OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT LAST MONTH THE 
FASTEST DECLINE SINCE THE EARLY 
NINETIES HOUSE PRICES MAY BE LOWER BUT 
MANY BUYERS ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO 
GET A MORTGAGE AS LENDERS RESTRICT 
THE NUMBER ON OFFER GORDON BROWN 
HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THE ECONOMY'S 
STILL IN GOOD SHAPE AND THAT THE 
FALL IN HOUSE PRICES IS CONTAINABLE 
MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST 
RICHARD SCOTT JOINS US ON WHAT 
THOSE FIGURES MEAN 
TODAY'S FIGURES SHOWING FALLING 
PRICES ARE DRAMATIC THE HALIFAX 
SAYS AVERAGE PRICES ACROSS THE U. K. 
FELL BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN MARCH 
THAT'S THE BIGGEST FALL FOR MORE 
THAN FIFTEEN YEARS MONTHLY FIGURES CAN 
BE QUITE VOLATILE THOUGH THE 
THREE MONTH FIGURE SHOWS PRICES 
DOWN BY ONE PER CENT BUT THERE ARE BIG 
DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE U. K. IN THE 
WEST MIDLANDS FOR EXAMPLE PRICES 
FELL BY FIVE PER CENT OVER THE LAST THREE 
MONTHS BUT IN LONDON THEY WERE UP 
ONE POINT SIX PER CENT SIXTEEN PER CENT THERE WERE RISES TOO IN THE EAST 
MIDLANDS THE NORTH AND SCOTLAND 
SOMETHING THAT'S HAVING A BIG 
EFFECT THOUGH IS LENDERS GETTING 
TOUGHER GOING BACK TO 
LAST 
YEAR BEFORE THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
THERE WERE NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND MORTGAGE 
DEALS ON OFFER NOW THERE ARE 
BARELY THREE THOUSAND FOR ANYONE WITHOUT A 
DEPOSIT THINGS ARE EVEN HARDER IN 
MAY THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED OF 
THESE DEALS AVAILABLE BUT AFTER 
ABBEY WITHDREW THEIRS YESTERDAY 
NOW THERE ARE NONE 
THAT'S MAKING FINDING A MORTGAGE 
HARD FOR SIMON TULLLY HE WANTS A 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT DEAL WORTH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT HE HAS 
BEEN TOLD THAT'S NOW IMPOSSIBLE 
THE ONLY TWO LENDERS WOULD BE 
PREPARED TO LEND WE'D NEED A FIVE PER CENT OR 
TEN PER CENT DEPOSIT WE'RE NOT IN A 
POSITION TO DO THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT 
MEANT THAT WE COULD NOT THEN GO OUT 
AND PURCHASE THE HOUSE THAT WE WERE 
LOOKING TO BUY 
SOME IN THE INDUSTRY SAY ANY BANK 
OF ENGLAND INTEREST RATE CUT ON 
THURSDAY WILL MAKE ANY LITTLE 
DIFFERENCE 
A LOT OF LENDERS HAVE DIFFERENCE WITHDRAWN FROM THE MARKET 
COMPLETELY PUSHING MORE 
APPLICATIONS TO THE REST IF 
INTEREST RATES WERE TO GO DOWN THIS 
WEEK IT'S LIKELY MORTGAGE RATES 
WILL CONTINUE TO CLIMB 
OF COURSE FALLING PRICES RAISED 
THE SPECTRE OF NEGATIVE EQUITY ONE 
OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S INTEREST 
COMMITTEE SAID IF PRICES FELL FIFTEEN PER CENT 
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE COULD BE IN 
THAT POSITION BUT FALLING PRICES 
ARE NOT NECESSARILY BAD NEWS 
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO MOVE UP THE 
PROPERTY LADDER SHOULD BENEFIT 
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH ANY HOME THEY'RE 
SELLING IS GOING TO BE CHEAPER THE 
MORE EXPENSIVE HOME THEY'RE BUYING 
IS LIKELY TO FALL EVEN MORE 
DESPITE THE FALL IN HOUSE PRICES 
GORDON BROWN IS STILL BULLISH ABOUT 
THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY OUR 
POLITICAL EDITOR NICK ROBINSON 
SPOKE TO THE PRIME MINISTER IN 
DOWNING STREET 
WE NOW KNOW THAT HOUSE PRICES FELL 
BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT LAST MONTH THIS IS THE 
BIGGEST FALL IN HOUSE PRICES SINCE 
THE BIG CRASH OF NINETEEN NINETY TWO ISN'T THE 
WORRYING TRUTH THAT THINGS CAN IN 
FACT ONLY GET WORSE 
WE HAVE A 
DIFFICULT SITUATION ARISING FROM 
WORLD CLASS' HAPPENED IN AMERICA 
IT'S FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED IN 
AMERICA IT'S AFFECTING EVERY 
GLOBAL ECONOMY WE'VE SEEN HOUSE 
PRICES RISE BY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PER CENT OVER THE LAST 
TEN YEARS 
PEOPLE SEE HOUSE PRICES 
FALLING MORTGAGES BEING REFUSED 
THEY SEE LOANS ENDING FOR SMALL 
BUSINESSES THEY FEAR THEY'RE IN 
FOR A TRULY DREADFUL TIME 
ECONOMICALLY 
I'M ALWAYS VIGILANT ECONOMICALLY THE RECORD IS OVER THE LAST TEN 
YEARS WE'VE MAINTAINED A COURSE OF 
STABILITY ALWAYS AT VERY 
DIFFICULT TIMES 
MANY PEOPLE WILL 
LOOK AT YOU THEY WILL LISTEN 
THEY'VE LISTENED TO YOU ON THE 
ECONOMY FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AND 
I THINK THEY'LL HEAR YOU SAY DON'T 
WORRY IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT 
IS THAT NOT IN DANGER OF BEING A 
COMPLACENT MESSAGE 
WHAT I'M SAYING 
IS THAT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN 
OUR POWER TO STEER A COURSE OF 
STABILITY FOR THE BRITISH ECONOMY 
WE WILL BE VIGILANT AT ALL TIMES 
NEVER COMPLACENT WHERE THERE ARE 
ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH 
SUCH AS IN THE HOUSING MARKET OR 
IN BUSINESS INVESTMENT WHERE WE 
CAN TAKE ACTION IN SUPPORT OF 
HOMEOWNERS PEOPLE WANTING TO BE 
HOMEOWNERS OR BUSINESSES THEMSELVES 
WE WILL DO SO AS WE'VE DONE TODAY 
AT THE SAME TIME OUR MAJOR PLANK 
FOR OUR ECONOMIC POLICY THE 
FOUNDATION OF IT IS MAINTAINING 
LOW INFLATION AND LOW INTEREST 
RATES THAT IS THE MEANS BY WHICH 
UNLIKE THE REST OF THE EURO AREA AT 
THE MOMENT WE ARE ABLE TO CUT 
INTEREST RATES AND ABLE TO CONTINUE 
TO MAINTAIN STABILITY AND GROWTH IN 
THE BRITISH ECONOMY AT A FASTER 
RATE THAN OTHER ECONOMIES IN 
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD 
KAREN MATTHEWS THE MOTHER OF NINE 
YEAR OLD SHANNON IS STILL BEING 
QUESTIONED IN CONNECTION WITH HER 
DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE MEANWHILE 
POLICE INVESTIGATING HER ABDUCTION 
HAVE CONTACTED REPRESENTATIVES OF 
THE MADELEINE MCCANN FUND IT'S 
UNDERSTOOD THE FUND WAS APPROACHED 
WHILE SHANNON WAS MISSING BY PEOPLE 
ASKING FOR MONEY TO HELP FIND HER 
SHANNON MATTHEWS' MOTHER IS STILL 
WITH THE POLICE AND STILL BEING 
INTERVIEWED SHE FACES A NUMBER OF 
KEY QUESTIONS DETECTIVES ARE 
FOCUSING TWENTY FOUR DAYS HER DAUGHTER WAS 
MISSING THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT 
CONTACT IF ANY SHE HAD WITH MICHAEL 
DONOVAN THE MAN CHARGED WITH 
KIDNAPPING SHANNON IT'S UNDERSTOOD 
THEY'RE ASKING HER ABOUT ALLEGED 
INCONSISTENCIES IN HER VERSION OF 
EVENTS EVENTS DETECTIVES ARE COMPARING COMMENTS 
SHE MADE WHEN HER DAUGHTER WAS 
MISSING WITH REMARKS HEARD BY A 
POLICE FAMILY LIAISON OFFICER WHICH 
KAREN MATTHEWS IS ALLEGED TO HAVE 
MADE TO FRIENDS ON SUNDAY NIGHT 
IN DEWSBURY TODAY THIS CLOSE 
FRIEND OF KAREN MATTHEWS GAVE HER 
HER SUPPORT 
I AM GOING TO REMAIN A 
FRIEND WHATEVER HAPPENS L. L. WAS 
KAREN'S FRIEND BEFORE SIX WEEKS 
AGO AND I'LL STILL BE KAREN'S 
FRIEND IN SIX MONTHS' TIME 
SINCE NINE YEAR OLD SHANNON WAS 
FOUND THREE WEEKS AGO THESE 
RESIDENTS HAVE WOKEN UP EVERY 
MORNING TO DIFFERENT RUMOURS AND 
ENDLESS SPECULATION 
WE HAVE YOUR SON YOURSON LIAM 
HALF A MILLION QUID IF YOU WANT TO 
SEE HIM AGAIN WE'LL BE IN TOUCH 
THERE WERE SUGGESTIONS IN NATIONAL 
NEWSPAPERS TODAY THAT SHANNON'S 
DISAPPEARANCE WAS A SCAM SIMILAR TO 
THIS EPISODE OF THE CHANNEL FOUR 
SERIES SHAMELESS WHERE MEMBERS OF 
A FAMILY FAKED THE KIDNAPPING OF 
THEIR SON BUT POLICE SOURCES SAY 
THERE IS NO LINK 
AFTER SHANNON DISAPPEARED IN 
FEBRUARY SOMEONE PURPORTING TO BE 
CLOSE TO HER FAMILY CONTACTED 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE THE 
MADELEINE MCCANN FUND LOOKING FOR 
MONEY IT WAS CONFIRMED TODAY THAT 
POLICE ARE LOOKING INTO THIS 
IT IS A WIDE RANGING INQUIRY BUT 
TONIGHT MUCH OF THE FOCUS REMAINS 
ON SHANNON'S MOTHER POLICE HAVE TO 
DECIDE VERY SOON WHETHER TO CHARGE 
HER OR RELEASE HER 
THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO ABANDON 
THE TORCH RELAY ALTOGETHER AFTER 
THE VIOLENCE WHICH MARRED THE 
PARADES IN PARIS LONDON AND ATHENS 
CHINA IS SAID TO BE RESISTING THE 
SUGGESTION TODAY THE FLAME ARRIVED 
IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE YET MORE 
DEMONSTRATIONS ARE PLANNED 
AS OUR SPORTS EDITOR MIHIR BOSE 
REPORTS FROM BEIJING MANY IN THE 
OLYMPIC MOVEMENT ARE FEARING THE 
WHOLE EVENT IS BEING TARNISHED 
THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT WILL BE 
WATCHING SAN FRANCISCO WITH 
TREPIDATION AS THE BEIJING TORCH 
CONTINUES ITS DISASTROUS JOURNEY 
AROUND THE WORLD SHOULD THERE BE 
MORE TROUBLE THIS COULD BE THE 
LAST FOREIGN CITY IT VISITS 
PEACE AND HARMONY WERE MEANT TO BE 
THE WATCHWORD OF THIS GATHERING OF 
THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT IN BEIJING 
WITH PAT ON THE BACK FOR THE 
CHINESE FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE 
GAMES BUT THAT TUNE HAS 
DRAMATICALLY CHANGED 
TALKING TO I. O. C. MEMBERS HERE I HAVE 
BEEN TOLD THAT CHINA WAS REPEATEDLY 
WARNED BY HIGH OLYMPIC OFFICIALS 
NOT TO HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL TORCH 
RELAY THE TALK HERE NOW IS THAT 
THE OLYMPIC BRAND HAS BEEN DAMAGED 
THERE'S GROWING FEELING THAT 
SHOULD SAN FRANCISCO GO THE WAY OF 
PARIS OR LONDON BEIJING'S 
INTERNATIONAL TORCH RELAY MAY HAVE 
TO BE CURTAILED IF NOT CANCELLED 
A DECISION ON THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN 
LATER THIS WEEK WHEN INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE PRESIDENT JACQUES 
ROGGE CHAIRS AN EXECUTIVE BOARD 
MEETING 
WE WILL DISCUSS THIS AND MEETING SEE WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AFTER 
THIS I THINK NOW THE SIXTH OF THE 
SEVENTH LEG AND WE'LL SEE WHAT KIND 
OF CONCLUSIONS WE HAVE TO TAKE FROM 
THAT THAT THE PROTESTS BEGAN AS SOON AS THE 
FLAME WAS LIT IN OLYMPIA THE BIRTH 
PLACE OF THE OLYMPICS 
IT INTENSIFIED THROUGH ITS THIRTY ONE MILE 
ORDEAL THROUGH LONDON 
THE FLAME ITSELF WAS EXTINCT WISHED 
DURING ITS TROUBLED PASSAGE THROUGH 
PARIS ALL THIS HAS MADE EVEN GREAT 
OLYMPIANS QUESTION WHETHER THE 
JOURNEY IS WORTHWHILE 
HAVING SEEN 
WHAT I'VE SEEN AND WITNESSED ON 
SUNDAY IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD IDEA 
PEOPLE ARE LINING THE STREETS TO 
SEE THE TORCH FOR THE RIGHT REASONS 
AREN'T GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
FEEL THAT OLYMPIC SPIRIT AND 
POSSIBLY NOT EVEN SEE THE TORCH AT 
ALL ALL JACQUES ROGGE AND THE I. O. C. MUST NOW 
DECIDE HOW BEST TO RESTORE THE 
TARNISHED IMAGE OF THE OLYMPIC 
MOVEMENT MOVEMENT THE PROSECUTION AT THE TRIAL OF THE 
EIGHT BRITISH MEN WHO ARE ACCUSED 
OF PLOTTING TO BLOW UP 
TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHTS HAS SAID THE 
SUSPECTED RING LEADER HAD 
DETAILED BLUEPRINT FOR THE PLANNED 
ATTACKS A JURY HEARD HOW A MEMORY 
STICK WAS FOUND MA CAR USED BY 
ABDULLAH AHMED ALLEY AT THE TIME OF 
HIS ARRESTS 
THE PROSECUTION ALSO CLAIMS THAT 
HIS DIARY CONTAINED SUSPICIOUS 
NOTES AND DIAGRAMS ALL THE 
DEFENDANTS NIGH SUSPICION TO MURDER 
AND ENDANGER AIRCRAFT 
THE BABYSHAMBLES SINGER PETE 
DOHERTY HAS BEEN JAILED FOR FOURTEEN 
WEEKS HE WAS FOUND GUILTY THIS 
AFTERNOON OF FAILING TO COMPLY WITH 
HIS BAIL CONDITIONS AND USING CLASS 
A DRUGS HE WAS JAILED AFTER 
HEARING AT WEST EALING MAGISTRATES' 
COURT COURT A HIGH COURT JUDGE HAS RULED THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT ACTED UNLAWFULLY BY 
DECIDING TO CHANGE THE RULES FOR 
HIGHLY SKILLED FOREIGN WORKERS A 
NEW POINTS SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED 
TWO YEARS AGO IT NOW MEANS 
THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WILL HAVE TO 
REAPPLY FOR RESIDENCY UNDER THE 
STRICTER SYSTEM IF THEY WANT TO 
STAY WITHIN THE U. K. 
MOHAMED AL FAYED IS CONSULTING HIS 
LAWYERS FOLLOWING THE VERDICT IN 
THE INQUEST INTO THE DEATHS OF HIS 
SON DODI AND DIANA PINCESS OF 
WALES TODAY HER FORMER BODYGUARD 
TREVOR REES WHO IS THE ONLY 
SURVIVOR OF THE CRASH JOINED A 
GROWING CHORUS OF PEOPLE SAYING 
IT'S NOW TIME TO MOVE ON 
HERE'S OUR ROYAL CORRESPONDENT 
NICHOLAS WITCHELL 
AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN HER ADULT 
LIFE AND OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS 
SINCE HER DEATH SHE HAS BEEN AT THE 
CENTRE OF COMPETEING OPINIONS BUT 
TODAY ON THE SUBJECT OF DIANA 
PINCESS OF WALES THERE IS 
GROWING CONSENSUS IT IS TIME TO 
ACCEPT THE INQUEST VERDICT AND MOVE 
ON ON I 
THINK IT'S TIME TO DRAW A LINE L. THINK THE PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY 
HAVE SPOKEN FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY 
WHEN THEY SAY THIS IS TIME TO BRING 
THIS TO THOUGHT WAS EXPRESSED BY 
TREVOR REES THE BODYGUARD WHO WAS 
THE SOLE SURVIVOR OF THE CRASH AND 
WHO GAVE EVIDENCE AT THE INQUESTS 
HE ISSUED BRIEF STATEMENT 
THAT'S CERTAINLY THE WISH OF 
PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY THEY'VE 
SAID THEY AGREE WITH THE VERDICTS 
AND THEY'VE INDICATED THAT THEY 
HOPE THIS WILL FINALLY PUT AN END 
TO ALL THE DISCREDITED SPECULATION 
ABOUT MURDER CONSPIRACY 
THAT REALLY JUST LEAVES ONE PERSON 
AND IT APPEARS THAT MOHAMED AL 
FAYED IS STILL CLINGING TO THE 
CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT HE DID 
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE TO CREATE 
ACCORDING TO HIS STAFF MR. AL FAYED 
IS KEEPING HIS OPTIONS OPEN THE 
LAWYERS WHO HAVE ALREADY MADE A 
SMALL FORTUNE FROM HIS MISCONCEIVED 
CLAIMS WERE TODAY BEING CONSULTED 
AGAIN AGAIN I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT NEED 
COLONEL ANYBODY IS WHETHER THERE'S 
ANY LEGAL REDRESS WHETHER ANYTHING 
WILL BE PLAYED OUT IN THE PUBLIC 
ARENA ANY MORE IT'S VERY UNLIKELY 
THERE WILL BE BUT HE'S JUST 
KEEPING HIS OPTIONS OPEN AT THE 
MOMENT MOMENT FOR ONE PERSON THOUGH THE LEGAL 
PROCESS DOES APPEAR TO BE OVER 
PAUL BURRELL DIANA'S FORMER BUTLER 
WHO THE CORONER HAD SAID HAD TOLD 
LIES IN THE WITNESS BOX IS NOT TO 
BE PROSECUTED FOR PERJURY THE 
CORONER HAS SAID HE WON'T BE TAKING 
MR. BURRELL'S DISHONESTY ANY FURTHER 
AND NOW A LOOK AT THE TIME OUR TOP 
STORY TONIGHT 
HOUSE PRICES DROP BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN A 
MONTH THAT'S THE BIGGEST FALL FOR 
MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS COMING UP 
HEROES RETURN FOR THIS ROYAL MARINE 
AND HIS COMRADES BACK FROM 
AFGHANISTAN 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON 
PARENTS IN SOUTH EAST LONDON WARNED 
OF A MEASLES OUTBREAK BECAUSE TOO 
FEW CHILDREN ARE BEING IMMUNISED 
ARSENAL AND CHELSEA FANS GET READY 
FOR THE BIGGEST NIGHT OF THE SEASON 
BADGERS ARE TO BE CULLED AS PART OF 
A PILOT SCHEME IN WALES TO SEE 
WHETHER IT WILL COMBAT THE SPREAD 
OF TUBERCULOSIS IN COWS FARMERS 
ARGUE THAT BADGERS PASS ON THE 
DISEASE TO HERDS CONSERVATIONISTS 
SAY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT 
CULLING IS THE ANSWER WYRE DAVIS 
REPORTS FROM LLANDEILO IN 
CARMARTHENSHIRE CARMARTHENSHIRE THERE HAVE BEEN LIMITED BADGER 
CULLS BEFORE BUT NOTHING ON THIS 
UNPRECEDENTED INTENSE SCALE WE ARE 
TOLD THAT BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS IN 
WALES IS AT CRISIS POINT AND 
HEALTHY ANIMALS LIKE THESE HAVE TO 
BE PROTECTEDED FARMERS ARE PLEASED 
BADGER SUPPORT GROUPS ARE FURIOUS 
BADGERS ARE INDUSTRIOUS AND 
INTELLIGENT AND SOCIAL ANIMALS FOR 
MORE THAN ZERO YEARS GARETH MORGAN 
HAS WATCHED AND STUDIED BADGER 
FAMILIES IN THEIR MID WALES HABITAT 
THEY'RE DOING HERE WHAT THEY'VE 
BEEN DONE FOR THOUSANDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
BEEN DONE FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
LET'S HOPE WE NEVER LOSE THEM 
FOR YEARS BADGERS HAVE RIGHTLY OR 
WRONGLY BEEN BLAMED FOR SPREADING 
TUBERCULOSIS AMONG CATTLE FARMERS 
HAVE LONG CALLED FOR A SIGNIFICANT 
COUPLE OF BADGER NUMBERS IN WALES 
THIS AFTERNOON THE WELSH 
AGRICULTURE MINISTER WENT SOME WAY 
TO HEEDING THAT CALL 
THE ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENT WILL NOW 
ERADICATE ALL BADGERS IN DEFINED 
GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF WALES AS PART 
OF A WIDER PLAN TO DEFEAT T. B. A 
DISEASE WHICH THE ASSEMBLY 
GOVERNMENT SAYS HAS GOT OUT OF 
CONTROL CONTROL THAT HAS ENRAGED WILDLIFE GROUPS 
THEY SAY CULL IS A 
UNNECESSARY AND WON'T WORK THERE'S THERE'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARY FOCUS ON BADGERS 
FOR YEARS AND YEARS THE PROBLEM IS 
JUST GETTING WORSE IT'S TIME TO 
LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE YET 
WHICH IS PROPER CATTLE CONTROLS 
BADGER GROUPS WANT MORE CATTLE TO 
BE TESTED TO ESTABLISH EXACTLY 
WHERE THE T. B. INFECTION COMES FROM 
BUT FARMERS AND MANY VETS SAY 
BADGER NUMBERS MUST BE KEPT DOWN 
COMPENSATING WELSH FARMERS FOR T. B. 
INFECTED CATTLE COST FIFTEEN MILLION 
LAST YEAR EVERYONE AGREES IT'S A 
PROBLEM THAT MUST BE TACKLED BUT 
HOW HOW IT'S LUD ROWS REALLY TAKING CATTLE 
OUT OF INFECTED HERDS IF WE'RE NOT 
GETTING RID OF THE SOUFRS INFECTION 
I'D BE IN FAVOUR OF CULLING 
WILDLIFE AS LONG AS IT'S PROVEN 
THEY ARE INFECTED AND THEY ARE SORT 
OF CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS THE SPREAD 
OF TUBERCULOSIS 
NO ONE'S REALLY 
SURE IF IT WILL WORK BUT IN AN 
AREA OF WALES YET TO BE DEFINED AN 
AWFUL LOT OF BADGERS WILL BE CULLED 
TONIGHT THE BADGER TRUST CALLED 
THIS IS A CYNICAL POLITICAL ACT 
THAT HAD NOTHING AT ALL DO WITH 
SCIENCE IT IS HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL 
IT WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHED IN OTHER 
PARTS OF THE U. K. WHERE THEY'VE YET 
TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO ABOUT T. B. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE TOP AMERICAN MILITARY LEADER IN 
AMERICA GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS 
SAYS PEACE IN THE COUNTRY IS STILL 
FRAGILE HE TOLD THE U. S. CONGRESS 
THAT THE SO CALLED TROOP SURGE 
HAD WORKED BUT THAT THE NUMBERS 
WOULD NEED TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN IN 
THE SUMMER FROM WALKS HERE'S 
JONATHAN BEALE 
FIVE YEARS ON AND U. S. TROOPS ARE 
STILL FIGHTING A WAR WITH NO END IN 
SIGHT DODGE FIRE 
ATTACKS LIKE THIS MAY BE DOWN BUT 
FOUR THOUSAND U. S. TROOPS HAVE ALREADY DIED 
AMERICA'S SENIOR MILITARY COMMANDER 
THOUGH CLAIMS PROGRESS IS BEING 
MADE MADE BRING THEM HOME BRING THEM HOME 
IT'S STILL AN UNPOPULAR WAR 
PROTESTORS INTERRUPTED GENERAL 
DAVID PETRAEUS AS HE PREPARED TO 
GIVE HIS LATEST ASSESSMENT TO 
CONGRESS FOR HIM IT WAS OF FACING 
THE CHALLENGE NOT FOR QUITTING 
THE SITUATION IN CERTAIN AREAS ARE 
STILL UNSATISFACTORY INNUEMERABLE 
CHALLENGES REMAIN EVENTS IN THE 
LAST TWO WEEKS HAVE REMINDED US THE 
PROGRESS MADE SINCE LAST SPRING IS 
FRAGILE AND REVERSIBLE 
THERE ARE 
NOW ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND U. S. TROOPS IN IRAQ THE 
AIM IS TO REDUCE THAT NUMBER TO 
PRE SURGE LEVELS OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND TROOPS 
BY THIS SUMMER BUT THERE ARE NO 
PLANS FOR FURTHER TROOP REDUCTIONS 
AFTER THAT 
SO HOW MUCH LONGER WILL AMERICAN 
TROOPS STAY IN IRAQ THAT IS NOW A 
QUESTION FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT 
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE JOHN 
MCCAIN'S COMMITMENT IS OPEN ENDED 
HE HAS SAID THAT U. S. TROOPS COULD 
STAY IN IRAQ FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
IF NECESSARY TODAY HE SOUND MORE 
OPTIMISTIC 
MY GOAL IS AN IRAQ THAT OPTIMISTIC NO LONGER NEEDS AMERICAN TROOPS L. 
BELIEVE WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT GOAL 
PERHAPS SOONER THAN MANY IMAGINE 
FOR THE DEMOCRATS BARACK OBAMA 
SAID HE WOULD PULL OUT ALL COMBAT 
TROOPS WITHIN SIXTEEN MONTHS WHILE 
HILLARY CLINTON'S PROMISING 
PHASED WITHDRAWAL WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF 
TAKING OFFICE 
WELL WE ARE HALF 
WAY THROUGH THE YEAR AS MANY OF US 
PREDAIPBGTD AS YOU YOURSELF STATED 
WE STILL DO NOT SEE SUFFICIENT 
PROGRESS 
WITH THE ELECTION PROGRESS CAMPAIGN WELL UNDER WAY THE IRAQ 
WAR IS NOT SO MUCH A PROBLEM FOR 
PRESIDENT BUSH MORE A DILEMMA FOR 
HIS SUCCESSOR AND WITH THE 
TESTIMONY FROM AMERICA'S SENIOR 
MILITARY COMMANDER THAT U. S. TROOPS 
ARE MAKING PROGRESS THE QUESTION 
NOW PARTICULARLY FOR THE DEMOCRATS 
IS CAN THEY AFFORD TO IGNORE HIS 
ADVICE AND BRING ABOUT A SPEEDY END 
TO THIS WAR 
GERRY AND KATE MCCANN HAVE BEEN
