WELL IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY THEY MAY HAVE BEEN USED IN FACT FOR OPENING GATES AND WHEN

COMING DOWN IN THEIR ELEGANT DRESSES AND TAKING BREAKFAST TOGETHER I LIKE THIS 
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THEM HARRODS THAT CAUGHT MY EYE SHE SPOTTED IT 
THAT'S PRETTY QUICK THERE'S HARRODS ON THE 
BOTTOM THERE AND THEN OF COURSE HARRODS IS THE RETAILER A RETAILER'S NAME LIKE THAT 
EVERYBODY WANTS SOMETHING FROM HARRODS REALLY LIFTS THEM AND REALLY HELPS THE PRICE 
WHAT YEAR IS IT WELL I WOULD PUT THEM PROBABLY ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN THIRTY 
IN DATE BUT OF COURSE THE STYLE AND THE DESIGN OF THEM IS MUCH EARLIER 
THEY'RE A GEORGIAN SHAPE THIS VERY TAPERED BODY YOU SEE THEY'RE STRAIGHT SIDED AND TAPERED 
A VERY SORT OF RESTRAINED CLASSICAL SHAPE WHICH THE GEORGIANS USED IN THEIR SILVER 
THEY ARE SILVER PLATE RATHER THAN SILVER THERE'S NO ENGLISH HALLMARK ON THEM IF THEY WERE SILVER 
YOU'D BE TALKING A LOT OF MONEY WELL OVER OUR BUDGET HOW MUCH ARE THEY 
WELL THE TICKET PRICE NOW DON'T BE TOO SHOCKED IS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
FOR THE PAIR 
WHOA IT'S A BIT STEEP BIT STEEP 
BUT I MEAN SILVER PLATE ISN'T SELLING AS WELL AS SILVER AND I WOULDN'T PERSUADE YOU UNLESS 
THEY HAD THAT HARRODS MARK WHICH I THINK WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE WHAT WOULD YOU PAY FOR THEM 
EIGHTY 
YEAH ABOUT THAT ABOUT THAT MAYBE NINETY TOPS 
AT AUCTION I CAN SEE THEM MAKING ANYTHING FROM 
EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED SO I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT RIGHT REALLY YES 
WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF PERSUADING SO I NEED YOUR HELP 
O. K. BUT YOU LIKE THEM I LOVE THEM YOU LOVE THEM DON'T YOU SERIOUSLY YES I REALLY DO COME ON THEN 
THESE LADIES WEREN'T SETTLING FOR KNIGHTSBRIDGE PRICES EIGHTY AND THE HARRODS COFFEE SET WAS THEIRS 
IT'S NOT JUST OUR TEAMS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A BARGAIN THE EXPERTS WILL BE GIVEN THE LEFTOVER LOLLY TO 
BUY THAT BONUS BUY WHICH MAY BOOST OR LOSE THE TEAM'S PROFITS YOU CAN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO IT CAN YOU 
BUT BEFORE ALL THAT JAMES WILL HAVE TO FIRE UP THE BLUES OVER HIS LATEST FIND 
NOW PEGGY WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS I DON'T LIKE IT WHY NOT PEGGY 
IT'S SOMETHING I WOULD PUT THE KITCHEN ROLL ON 
REALLY YES I THINK IT IS 
WELL 
HAVE YOU CANDLES IN YOUR HOUSE 
NO NO NO CANDLES NO HEALTH AND HAVE YOU GOT ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY 
IT'S CALLED A CANDLE DOUSER 
CANDLE IS THE IN THING NOW ISN'T IT CANDLES AND THINGS 
YES ALL THESE AROMATHERAPY NO 
AND THE TOFFS ARE STILL LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO BLOW THEIR CANDLES OUT AREN'T THEY 
YES QUITE EXACTLY THIS COULD BE A WINNER IT'S A CURIOUS ITEM IT'S A CONVERSATION PIECE ISN'T IT 
CURIOUS YES CURIOUS IS RIGHT 
LOOK IT COMES FROM A VERY SMART HOUSE WE'VE EVEN GOT THE OWNER'S CREST ON IT AS WELL 
ALL RIGHT O. K. IF YOU TWO LIKE IT AND YOU LIKE IT 
I LIKE IT IT'S MADE BY A GOOD MAKER THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY'VE GOT IT PRICED AT NINETY 
WHAT NINETY 
NO 
NINETY PEGGY SHOW ME 
THERE IT IS WRITTEN IN BLACK AND WHITE FOR YOU NINETY 
NO NO WHAT'S THAT IN RHYMING SLANG THEN 
TOO MUCH TOO MUCH IS IT 
LET'S GO DEAL LET'S GO AND DEAL HAVE A GO WE'LL DEAL 
I'LL GIVE HER A CHINESE BURN 
YES THAT'S BETTER 
WELL THEY COULD BE SET FOR A FLAMING GOOD PROFIT JUST FIFTY FIVE PAID 
KATE LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND 
I WONDERED WHERE YOU'D GOT TO SO DID YOU FIND THIS YES I DID 
NOW WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THIS THEN ELAINE I JUST LIKE THE COLOURS THAT THEY HAVE ON IT 
YES AND IS THAT PAPER MACHE 
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S PAPER MACHE AND THEN LACQUERED WITH 
THAT BLACK LACQUER THAT WAS TYPICALLY USED IN THE VICTORIAN PERIOD O. K. 
ONCE PRINCE ALBERT HAD DIED IT WAS ESSENTIALLY AN AGE OF MOURNING SO THERE WERE A LOT 
OF BLACK ITEMS AROUND AND THEY LIKED HEAVY BLACK DECORATIVE PIECES SO THIS IS TYPICALLY VICTORIAN 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN LAID WHAT ALL THE PRETTY COLOURS ARE HERE NO 
IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE MOTHER OF PEARL BUT MOTHER OF PEARL IS VERY PEARLY 
A BIT WHITER IN COLOUR WHEREAS WE'VE GOT 
AS YOU SAY LOTS OF PRETTY COLOURS HERE WE'VE GOT BLUES GREENS PINKS AND IT'S ACTUALLY AN ABALONE SHELL 
THIS IS TAKEN FROM LIKE THE MOTHER OF PEARL BUT DIFFERENT IN THAT WE'VE 
GOT THIS LOVELY VARIETY OF COLOUR AND A LOVELY GEOMETRIC SYMMETRICAL DESIGN AGAIN TYPICALLY VICTORIAN 
I WAS GOING TO SAY AND IF WE OPEN IT UP LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE 
THAT'S NICE WE'VE THE ORIGINAL INTERIOR A LITTLE BIT DIRTY BUT IT IS THE ORIGINAL 
IF THE PAPER MACHE WAS DAMAGED 
OR THE SHELL MISSING THEN I'D SAY IT'S A BIT OF A PROBLEM BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF DIRT LIKE THAT 
IS PART OF ITS CHARACTER IT'S OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
O. K. WOULD YOU CALL IT A DESIGNER OF THE VICTORIAN TIME LIKE YOUR CHANELS AND YOUR ARMANI 
YES THE GLASSES CASES OF TODAY 
YES I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS DESIGNER AS SUCH I MEAN YOU WOULD SEE A FEW OF THESE 
ABOUT IT'S NOT RARE YOU WILL SEE THEM IN ANTIQUES MARKETS ABOUT INSIDE OF COURSE IT'S QUITE SMALL 
SO WHAT TYPE OF LADY WOULD USE THAT KIND OF GLASSES CASE DO YOU THINK 
IT WOULD BE A WELL TO DO LADY THAT HAD ONE OF 
THESE IN THE VICTORIAN PERIOD SHE WAS PERHAPS INTO SEWING 
O. K. REALLY A LADY OF LEISURE RATHER THAN A LADY OF THE WORKING CLASSES 
A BIT LIKE ME A LADY OF LEISURE WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING THE GLASSES CASE IN THE TOP POCKET 
SO EVERYBODY CAN SEE HOW ELEGANT IT LOOKS ON ME 
I THINK IT WOULD LOOK BETTER ON ME IT'D LOOK BETTER ON ME I FOUND IT 
YOU SAID ELAINE YOU WANTED A LITTLE PRETTY BOX 
YES AND I SUPPOSE THIS FITS THAT DESCRIPTION BUT AS I SAID TO YOU IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY RARE SO VALUE 
AT AUCTION WILL BE FAIRLY LOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRICE TAG IS BUT AT AUCTION 
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE AROUND THE TWENTY THIRTY MARK 
O. K. 
WELL IT'S THIRTY FOUR RIGHT THAT'S THE TICKET PRICE 
YES BUT WE HAGGLED A BIT SHE HAGGLED YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS 
IT WAS HER IT WAS HER WITHOUT ME YOU BOUGHT IT WITHOUT ME YES BUT I KNEW YOU WOULD LIKE IT 
I SAID TO HER SHE WOULD GET IN TROUBLE SO WHAT DID YOU PAY 
I TRIED TO GET IT DOWN TO TWENTY SHE DID SHE HAGGLED SHE HAGGLED SHE HAGGLED 
BUT I CAN HEAR A BUT COMING TWENTY FIVE 
NOT BAD NOT BAD 
THANK YOU YES THAT WAS ME THANK YOU SO CAN WE GO AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA NOW YES 
SO AN OPEN AND SHUT CASE AT TWENTY FIVE WILL THAT BE ENOUGH TO SEE THEM MAKE A PROFIT 
NO NO NOT REALLY 
ARE THEY ALL MOTHER OF PEARL YOURS OR SOME PLASTIC 
JOHN JOHN JAMES LOOK WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S LOVELY BETTER THAN YOUR PEA SHOOTER

CHURN SLASH PLANTER I THINK IT'S A LOVELY OBJECT NICELY TURNED OVER THE END IT'S A NICE CONSTRUCTION HERE 
IT SEEMS VERY SMART FOR A CHURN DOESN'T IT 
I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY 
IT'S BRASS AND YOU TURN IT OVER AND VOILA LOOK AT THAT BOTTOM 
THAT LOOKS LIKE A MAHOGANY OR A TEAK HARDWOOD WOULD SUGGEST ORIENTAL ORIGIN WOULDN'T IT

OF CONSTRUCTION HERE WE ARE THEY'RE NOT HIDING HOW IT'S MADE 
THEY'VE GOT THIS VERY NICE REEDED COLLARS TO ALL THE NUTS HERE AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S BRASS

FOR ME RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMEWHERE FASCINATING 
I'VE TAKEN A TRIP DOWN THE THAMES TO HAM HOUSE IN RICHMOND 
A SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PILE WITH A RICH AND RATHER FRAGRANT HISTORY 
ONE OF THE CHATELAINES OF HAM HOUSE 
ELIZABETH THE DUCHESS OF LAUDERDALE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN SMELLING SWEET 
BATHROOMS IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WERE PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF AND A CONSIDERABLE LUXURY 
THE DUCHESS HAD THIS ONE BUILT DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH HER BEDROOM 
AND SHE'D COME SCURRYING DOWN THESE STAIRS WHEN SHE FELT IN NEED OF A BIT OF A DOUCHE 
TO TAKE A BATH IN THAT TIME YOU'D HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A PAVILLON DE BAIN ONE OF THESE TENTED 
CONSTRUCTIONS WITHIN WHICH SHE'D HAD A SOCKING GREAT TUB FULL OF STEAMING WATER AND A SMALL STOOL 
SHE'D COME INSIDE LIKE THIS AND SQUAT HERSELF DOWN 
AND PROBABLY HAD A LITTLE SONG SPLISH SPLASH I WAS TAKING A BATH 
ANYWAY AFTER A BIT SHE'D COME OUT OF THERE AND SHE'D PROCEED INTO THIS ROOM NEXT DOOR WHICH 
IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A RECOVERY ROOM IN TODAY'S SPA PARLANCE 
A SORT OF PAMPERING ROOM LONG CHAISE LONGUE 
ONTO WHICH SHE WOULD RECLINE AND BE COVERED IN TOWELS AND ALL SORTS OF NICE SMELLY SUBSTANCES 
MOST PEOPLE EVEN IN THE HIGHEST SOCIAL STRATUM 
HARDLY EVER WASHED ANYTHING EXCEPT THEIR FACES HANDS AND FEET 
IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH CROMWELL'S TAX ON SOAP 
CROMWELL'S TAX ON SOAP DIDN'T STOP THE DUCHESS OF LAUDERDALE SMELLING SWEET 
OH NO SHE WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY 
AND IN A PLACE LIKE THIS THE STILL ROOM AT HAM HOUSE THEY CAME UP WITH ALL SORTS OF SWEET SMELLING SMELLS 
YOU TAKE A DEVICE LIKE THIS AND IN THE BOTTOM BASIN YOU'D FILL IT WITH RED HOT EMBERS OF CHARCOAL 
THEN YOU'D POP THE BOWEL ON THE TOP AND INTRODUCE SOME SPIRIT SOMETHING LIKE FRENCH BRANDY THEN YOU'D TAKE 
A SPRINKLING OF ROSE PETALS PERHAPS A BIT OF LAVENDER AND SOME CAMOMILE MARINADE THAT IN THE SPIRIT 
AND LET THE THING COOK FOR A BIT 
IT WOULD GIVE OFF A VAPOUR WHICH WOULD CONDENSE IN THE BELL AND ULTIMATELY DRIBBLE OUT 
IN A CONCENTRATED FORM THROUGH THAT ORIFICE 
WE'VE GOT TWO TYPES OF SOAP HERE THE DARK HARD COMMON WASH BALL FOR THE ORDINARY PEOPLE AND 
HERE THE LOVELY REFINED WHITE SOAP SCENTED WITH THE DUCHESS'S ESSENCES 
FOR THE USE OF THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF COURSE 
ALL THE SMELLS WERE CREATED USING FLOWERS AND HERBS GROWN HERE AT HAM AND AREN'T WE LUCKY TODAY THAT WE 
CAN HAVE THE USE OF SOAP WHICH IS UNTAXED AND MOST OF US HAVE GOT A BATHROOM 
I WONDER WHETHER THERE'S GOING TO BE THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS OVER AT THE AUCTION 
WELL WE'VE WHIZZED AROUND THE M. TWENTY FIVE TO SURREY TO BLETCHINGLEY 
TO LAWRENCE'S EXCELLENT SALE ROOM WITH ROBIN LAWRENCE GOOD MORNING 
PROPRIETOR NO LESS NOW ROBIN ELAINE AND JENNIFER HAVE GONE WITH THIS LITTLE GROUP 
THE MALACCA WHIP 
WHAT'S FAB ABOUT THAT IS THE HANDLE IT'S REALLY A RIDING CROP ISN'T IT 
YES CAN YOU SEE A SMART WOMAN CANTERING AROUND ROTTEN ROW WHACKING HER STEED WITH THIS I THINK I CAN 
YES BEATING OFF ALL HER ADMIRERS WILL IT MAKE ANY MONEY IN THE AUCTION DO YOU THINK 
WE THINK THIRTY TO FIFTY IS THAT ALL WELL WE'LL DO OUR BEST 
FORTY WAS PAID I THINK THEY WERE RATHER HOPING IT WOULD BRING SIXTY OR EIGHTY WHICH IT MIGHT DO 
IT'S POSSIBLE O. K. NOW THE HARRODS POTS 
SILVER PLATED RETAILED BY HARRODS A GEORGIAN STYLE BUT VERY MUCH MADE 
OUT OF THE PERIOD MID TWENTIETH CENTURY DATE NINETEEN FIFTIES THEN 
NINETEEN FIFTIES SIXTIES THIRTY TO FIFTY 
THIRTY TO FIFTY WELL THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED BY THAT WON'T THEY I THINK MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THEY OUGHT 
TO EXPECT YOU MIGHT STRUGGLE AND GET THIRTY IT IS POSSIBLE 
THEY PAID EIGHTY WHAT ABOUT THE PAPIER MACHE GLASSES CASE I MEAN THIS IS TERRIBLY DULL ISN'T IT 
IT'S NOT THE MOST EXCITING PIECE IN THE SALE BLACK LACQUER PAPIER MACHE WITH A 
LITTLE BIT OF MOTHER OF PEARL INLAY THE GOLD SPECTACLES IT ONCE CONTAINED WERE PERHAPS WORTH MORE THAN THE BOX 
YES TEN TO TWENTY IF YOU'RE LUCKY ON A GOOD DAY WITH THE WIND UP YOUR TAIL YES 
THEY PAID TWENTY FIVE FOR IT 
SO I SEE POTENTIALLY ONE BIG LOSS HERE YES ONE LITTLE LOSS HERE AND IF THEY'RE LUCKY 
A KIND OF A BREAK EVEN SO DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING 
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEIR BONUS ITEM HE'LL BE TAKING OVER SOON 
THAT WAS GOOD FUN WASN'T IT EXCELLENT 
EXCELLENT YOU SPENT ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE YOU GAVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE TO KATE BLISS WHAT DID SHE SPEND IT ON 
I BOUGHT A LITTLE VESTA CASE THIS IS ENGLISH SILVER TEMPTING THOUGH IT WAS TO BLOW THE 
WHOLE AMOUNT I WENT REALLY SMALL NOT ONLY HAVE I BOUGHT A SMALL ITEM 
BUT I'VE SPENT VERY LITTLE IN FACT IT COST ME JUST TWELVE 
YES 
THIS DATES FROM NINETEEN OH NINE QUITE A BIT OF AGE THERE ASSAYED IN BIRMINGHAM ALL IN REALLY NICE CONDITION 
ENGRAVED WITH THE NAME SPHINX SPHINX COULD HAVE BEEN A 
NICKNAME COULD HAVE BEEN I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF A PLACE PERHAPS BUT QUITE A SWEET LITTLE OBJECT

SHE'S TALKING ABOUT DOUBLING OR TRIPLING YOUR 
MONEY HERE KEEP THAT IN YOUR MIND BECAUSE YOU'LL DECIDE AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS 
RIGHT NOW FOR YOU GUYS AT HOME LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT IT

AT ONE PRESENTED TO SOMEBODY WITH THE NICKNAME SPHINX 
YES AN ENIGMATIC FACE A WOMAN WHO NEVER CHANGED HER EXPRESSION 
WELL TWENTY TO THIRTY WE FEEL WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT ISN'T IT 
I THINK SO THEY ONLY PAID TWELVE SO THAT'S NOT SO BAD IS IT NO 
NEXT IT'S THE BLUES AND THEY KICK ON WITH MURANO GLASS VASE 
NOW THE ONLY THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS THAT IT'S GOT THIS VERY STRANGE COLOUR SCHEME HASN'T IT 
TO HAVE YELLOW AND PURPLE CASED IN CLEAR GLASS 
YES IS QUITE ELEGANT REALLY 
I THINK SO THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF ACTIVITY AROUND TWENTIETH CENTURY GLASS AT THE MOMENT 
AND MAYBE AN INVESTMENT AREA FOR THE FUTURE 
AT THE MOMENT THOUGH WE'RE THINKING TEN TO TWENTY FOR THAT ONE 
TEN TO TWENTY WITH AN ELEMENT OF GROWTH FOR THE FUTURE O. K. FINE THIRTY FIVE THEY PAID 
THEY'LL BE ACUTELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT ESTIMATE 
NEXT IS THE CANDLE DOUSER WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AS A LITTLE NOVELTY THOUGH 
IT'S A NICE LITTLE PIECE IT'S CHESTER SILVER MADE BY
