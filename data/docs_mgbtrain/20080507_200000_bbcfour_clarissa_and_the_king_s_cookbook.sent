BUT ONE CORNER OF THIS DUTIFUL WORLD CLAMOURS WITH NOISE DAY IN DAY OUT 
THE KITCHENS OF RICHARD'S COURT 
AND I'M THRILLED TO TELL YOU 
THAT THE RECIPES COOKED BY THE KING'S MASTER CHEFS WERE RECORDED 
AND COMPILED INTO ENGLAND'S OLDEST KNOWN COOKBOOK THE FORME OF CURY 
THERE'S A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING 
IT'S A FORGOTTEN CHAPTER IN OUR CULINARY HISTORY 
AND I'M CONVINCED THAT RICHARD'S COOKBOOK WILL REVEAL 
THAT MANY OF THE DISHES WE EAT TODAY CAN BE TRACED BACK TO HIS KITCHEN 
I'LL FIND OUT IF OTHERS AGREE 
WHEN I FEED SOME MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFFS LATER 
BUT FIRST THE TALE OF THE KING 
THE COOK HIS KITCHEN AND HIS COOKBOOK 
RICHARD THE SECOND THE STORY GOES WAS SWADDLED IN THE SKIN OF GOATS AT BIRTH 
WHAT AN INTIMATE INTRODUCTION TO THE FRUITS OF HIS LAND 
CROWNED ENGLAND'S KING IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN HE WAS MEANT TO FOLLOW 
HIS FORBEARS AND BECOME A BLOODTHIRSTY PLANTAGENET MONARCH 
HISTORY RECORDS HOWEVER HE INSTEAD PURSUED THE GOOD LIFE 
I FEEL I CAN CALL HIM A GOURMET KING 
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE AND HIS COURTIERS ATE 
ONE PRECIOUS DOCUMENT FROM HIS REIGN HAS SURVIVED 
HERE IN THE IMPOSING BRITISH LIBRARY HIS COOKBOOK IS KEPT SECURE 
AND I'M NOW GOING TO FEAST ON RICHARD'S REGAL CUISINE 
WITH MEDIEVAL ARCHIVIST CLAIRE BREAY 
YOU CAN SEE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DAMAGED 
THE VERY FIRST WORDS 
A FORME OF CURY WAS COMPILED 
BY THE CHIEF MASTER COOKS OF KING RICHARD THE SECOND 
TRANSLATED FROM THE MIDDLE ENGLISH FORME MEANS METHOD AND CURY MEANS COOKING 
A METHOD OF COOKING 
SUCH STRAIGHTFORWARD MODERN LANGUAGE IN A ANCIENT TEXT 
I LOVE IT 
IT'S NEARLY SIX METRES LONG ALTOGETHER 
WE'LL BE HERE SOME TIME THEN YEP SO THIS IS THE INDEX 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT FADED AS YOU CAN SEE 
IT'S BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME YEAH 
QUITE A FEW STAINS YEAH STAINS OF THE KITCHEN 
SO HOW MANY RECIPES ARE THERE HERE 
THERE SEEM TO BE AN AWFUL LOT I KNOW THERE ARE 
ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX ALTOGETHER 
ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX IS TYPICAL ISN'T IT 
THEY COULDN'T MANAGE THE EXTRA FOUR TO MAKE IT TWO HUNDRED 
I'VE WRITTEN COOKBOOKS MYSELF 
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX RECIPES IS RATHER A LOT 
IT'S ACTUALLY MORE LIKE A COMPENDIUM 
HERE WE'VE PORPOISE IN BROTH PORPOISE 
HOW ARE WE COOKING THE PORPOISE 
SO IT SAYS MAKE AS YOU MADE NUMBLES OF FLESH WITH ONIONS 
NOT A LOT ABOUT HOW TO COOK A PORPOISE 
WELL I ADMIT MOST OF US WOULDN'T CONSIDER EATING PORPOISE TODAY 
BUT SOME OF THE DISHES HAVE VERY FAMILIAR NAMES BLANCMANGE 
BLANCMANGE NOW THAT'S PROPER BLANCMANGE 
MADE WITH CAPONS CAPONS YEP 
AND THERE ARE DOZENS OF RECIPES 
THAT WOULD FEATURE HAPPILY ON A MODERN MENU 
SALAD SALAD YES THEY DID EAT SALAD THEY DID YES 
SO TAKE PARSLEY SAGE GARLIC 
WHO SAYS THAT THE ENGLISH DON'T EAT GARLIC 
WHAT'S THAT WORD ROSEMARY ROSEMARY PURSLANE 
NOT A LETTUCE LEAF MENTIONED BUT STILL NO LESS A SALAD 
MINT WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WORD IS WASH THEM CLEAN 
WASH THEM CLEAN THEY WERE KEEN ON WASHING THINGS 
EVERYBODY THINKS THEY WERE DIRTY IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
THE RECIPES SOUND MODERN ON PAPER BUT WHAT WILL THEY TASTE LIKE 
A LIBRARY ISN'T A PLACE FOR A COOK 
MY PLACE IS HERE THE CHEFS DOMAIN 
LOOK AT THIS KITCHEN LOOK AT THE SPACE 
LOOK AT IT WITH ITS SKY LIGHT UP THE TOP 
A CATHEDRAL OF FOOD 
A MOST BEAUTIFUL ROOM WONDERFUL WITH THE LIGHT COMING IN 
THE FIRE BURNING IN THE CORNER 
AND THERE IN HIS CHAIR WOULD SIT THE CHEF 
WHO COULD SMELL WITH HIS EYES TASTE WITH HIS NOSE 
AND HEAR THE EXACT QUANTITIES OF PRECIOUS INGREDIENTS BEING ADDED 
HE WAS IN TOTAL COMMAND OF THOSE WORKING UNDER HIM 
LIKE TODAY THE KING'S MASTER CHEF WOULD HAVE WORKED HIS WAY UP 
THROUGH THE KITCHEN BEFORE GETTING TO THE PRIZED TOP JOB 
WITH A VAST COURT TO FEED HE LED A KITCHEN OF UP TO THREE HUNDRED STAFF 
ALL OF WHOM HAD CLEARLY DELINEATED ROLES 
THESE KITCHENS REALLY DID SWING 
SAUCE MAKERS 
WHO PREPARED SAUCES FOR THE VAST ARRAY OF DISHES 
MINCERS WHO MINCED AND GROUND SPICES ALL DAY LONG 
PLUCKERS 
ALL MANNER OF BIRDS FEATURED ON THE KING'S MENUS 
BONERS 
KNIFE SKILLS WERE ESSENTIAL AS CARCASES WERE STRIPPED BARE 
CHOPPERS 
A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF WOOD WAS REQUIRED 
SPIT BOYS 
MOST OF THE FOOD WAS COOKED IN FIREPLACES 
WHICH WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO ROAST A WHOLE OX 
AND ROASTERS 
TEAMS WORKED IN SHIFTS IN HIGH TEMPERATURES 
OFTEN WITH VIRTUALLY NO CLOTHES ON 
ALL THIS ACTIVITY DONE DAY IN DAY OUT 
UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE MASTER CHEF 
OVERSEEING RULING HIS KITCHEN 
VERY MUCH AS IT IS TODAY 
THE ONLY MAN IN THE KITCHEN WHO SAT 
AND HE WOULD TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO POINT TO WHERE THE MEAT WAS BURNING 
OVERSEEING EVERYTHING IN HIS DOMAIN 
HE WAS TRULY A CHEF 
A CHIEF OF HIS BRIGADE 
RICHARD'S COURT WAS OBSESSED WITH DOCUMENTING EVERYTHING 
FROM HOUSEHOLD LISTS TO COSTS OF GOODS TO THE FOOD HE ATE 
THANK GOD I SAY FOR MEDIEVAL WESTMINSTER SCRIBES 
THROUGH THAT DOOR THERE WOULD BE THE SCRIBE IN HIS LITTLE VESTIBULE 
TAKING NOTES OF RECIPES WRITING THEM DOWN LISTENING TO WHAT THE CHEF DICTATED 
COS THE CHEF PROBABLY COULDN'T WRITE 
I IMAGINE THEY PENNED RECIPES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
AS THE FORME OF CURY READS LIKE AN ALMANAC OF SEASONAL FOOD 
WHAT WAS A NECESSITY FOR THE MEDIEVAL KITCHEN 
IS A LA MODE TODAY OF COURSE 
THE LAND WAS THEIR SUPERMARKET 
FIFTY YEARS BEFORE RICHARD'S REIGN 
THE BLACK DEATH HAD WIPED OUT HALF THE HUMAN POPULATION 
THE DISEASE HOWEVER DIDN'T AFFECT THE WILD ANIMALS THEY FLOURISHED 
SO FOR RICHARD'S COURT 
FOOD WAS PLENTIFUL AND THE KINGDOM WAS A HUNTERS' PARADISE 
ALTHOUGH RICHARD WASN'T A PLANTAGENET WARRIOR KING 
HE LOVED THE BLOOD OF THE HUNT 
HE DICTATED THAT HIS NOBLEMEN AND HIS SERVANTS SHOULD 
AVAIL THEMSELVES AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY 
TO PRACTISE WITH A BOW AND ARROW 
HE HIMSELF OFTEN HUNTED WITH HIS GREYHOUNDS AS ONLY A KING COULD 
BUT ONE OF THE GREAT SPORTS OF THE TIME THAT RICHARD LOVED WAS FALCONRY 
RICHARD PARTICULARLY PRIDED HIMSELF AS A SPORTSMAN WHO WENT OUT 
AND CAUGHT FOOD FOR THE TABLE ALL SORTS 
EVERYTHING FROM HERONS TO DUCKS TO HARES 
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE ANIMAL 
THERE WERE STRICT RULES OF ETIQUETTE AS TO WHICH BIRDS YOU COULD HAVE 
ONLY A KING COULD CARRY AN EAGLE OR A GYRFALCON 
EVEN FOR A KING BUYING ONE OF THESE BIRDS 
WOULD HAVE MEANT DIGGING DEEP INTO THE ROYAL PURSE 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE RICHARD PAID TWO HUNDRED SIXTY GOLD FLORINS FOR A GYRFALCON 
THAT'S THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND IN TODAY'S MONEY 
THEY WERE VERY RARE 
BUT PRIZED FOR THEIR LONG DISTANCE FLYING AND HUNTING ACUMEN 
THIS WAS A BIRD FOR A KING 
AND IT KNOWS THAT IT'S BEING HELD BY A COMMON PLACE COOK 
SO IT'S TRYING TO GET AWAY NO YOU STAY WITH ME FOR A MINUTE 
A CAT MAY LOOK AT A KING AND A COOK MAY LOOK AT A GYRFALCON 
YEAH 
BUT NOT ALL MEATS WERE HUNTED 
GEESE WERE FARMED 
AND THERE'S ONE RECIPE IN THE FORME OF CURY 
THAT FOR RICHARD AND HIS CHEFS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MAIN EVENT 
OF ANY FEAST 
IT'S A DISH I'VE CHOSEN TO COOK BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL ALSO REVEAL 
JUST HOW CONTEMPORARY THE FOOD REALLY WAS 
TAKE SAGE PERSIL HYSSOP AND SAVORY QUINCES AND PEARS 
GARLIC AND GRAPES AND FILL THE GEESE THEREWITH AND SEW THE HOLE 
THAT NO GREASE COME OUT AND ROAST THEM WELL 
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS DISH 
IS THE AMOUNT OF HERBS AND QUITE EXPENSIVE SPICES THAT GOES INTO IT 
THEREFORE IT BECAME A LUXURY DISH 
AND SOMETHING THAT WOULD GRACE THE KING'S TABLE 
HERE WE HAVE SAGE WHICH WAS FOR THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 
SAGE WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO CLEAN THE BLOOD AND TO GIVE YOU WISDOM 
AND HYSSOP 
WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO CLEANSE YOU 
MY SOUL IS WHITER THAN THE SWAN WHEN WASHED WITH HYSSOP 
AND SAVOURY WHICH WAS A HERB THAT PREVENTED FLATULENCE 
VERY NECESSARY IN THE MEDIEVAL DIET 
SO A BIT OF THAT AND SOME PARSLEY PARSLEY CLEANS THE BREATH 
AND CLEANS THE BLOOD 
AND SOME GARLIC 
GARLIC OF COURSE BURNITH AWAY THE FAT THE GROWITH AROUND THE HEART 
COOKING AND MEDICINE WERE VERY INTERTWINED 
IT'S A BIT LIKE TODAY ISN'T IT 
WE HAVE THESE THINGS WHICH YOU'RE TOLD ARE GOOD FOR YOU 
BUT EACH GENERATION THINKS IT HAS THE ANSWER TO ETERNAL LIFE 
AND SOME CHOPPED PEARS 
THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN COOKING PEARS 
WARDEN PEARS PROBABLY 
FRUIT WITH GEESE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD IDEA 
IT'S WHAT WE DO TODAY 
I HAVE A RECIPE WHERE WE STUFF THE GOOSE WITH WILD CHERRIES 
THAT'S ALSO DELICIOUS 
AND THEN THE QUINCE 
QUINCES GREW IN THIS COUNTRY 
BUT THEY WERE MOSTLY IMPORTED FROM THE CONTINENT 
AND THAT WONDERFUL RICH SMELL AND TASTE 
WAS SOMETHING THAT THE MIDDLE AGES LOVED 
AND LASTLY SOME GRAPES 
RICHARD WAS VERY KEEN ON HIS EXOTIC FRUIT 
THE SMELL OF THAT WITH THE FRUIT AND THE HERBS IS QUITE DELICIOUS 
AND NOW WE PUT EVERYTHING INTO THE GOOSE 
JUST IN HANDFULS AS IT GOES 
STUFF IT RIGHT DOWN THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM IN A GOOSE 
THERE WE ARE 
AND NOW WE SEW THE GOOSE UP SO THAT NOTHING FALLITH FROM IT 
AND OF COURSE THE FAT WHICH IS IN THE GOOSE 
WILL LUBRICATE THE STUFFING 
WHICH IS WHY WE PUT NO OIL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN 
IF I WERE TO CHOOSE I'D COOK THIS OVER THE FIRE BEHIND ME 
AND SOME POOR LITTLE SCULLION WOULD HAVE TO SPEND 
THE NEXT FOUR HOURS CHOPPING WOOD AND FEEDING IT INTO THE FLAMES 
HOWEVER GIVEN THAT WE'RE NOW IN A MODERN AGE 
AND RICHARD WOULD PROBABLY HAVE APPROVED 
I'M GOING TO TRANSFER IT TO A MODERN OVEN 
THE FORME OF CURY 
DOESN'T GIVE DETAILS LIKE COOKING TIMES OR QUANTITIES 
AS TODAY THE CHEFS WERE EXPECTED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO 
BUT IT DOES DOCUMENT THE COOKING TECHNIQUES AND THE TERMINOLOGY 
HASN'T CHANGED IN SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS 
PARBOIL 
STRAIN 
CLARIFY 
TOAST 
BAKE 
AND ROAST 
NEXT THE COOKED GOOSE IS DRESSED WITH THE SAUCE MADAME 
A SAUCE FIT FOR A KING AS IT'S FULL OF EXPENSIVE SPICES 
AND THE SAUCE IS STARTED BY USING THE JUICY STUFFING 
SO NOW I'M GOING TO OPEN THE GOOSE 
AND THERE INSIDE YOU SEE IS ALL OUR LOVELY STUFFING 
BEAUTIFULLY COOKED 
ALL MOULDED TOGETHER THE HERBS AND THE FRUIT AND THE GRAPES 
AND THE QUINCES AND THE PEARS 
AND I'M JUST ADDING IT TO THE BREAD AND THE GELATINE 
AND NOW I'M GOING TO ADD MY POUDRE DOUCE 
WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SPICES 
AND REALLY IT WAS A MATTER FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CHEF 
BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ALWAYS WENT IN 
SALT OF COURSE 
SUGAR 
AND A BIT OF MACE AND SOME GROUND GINGER 
THEN I MIX ALL THIS TOGETHER PUT IT IN WITH MY GELATINE 
AND MY STUFFING AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND MIX IT TOGETHER 
AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT ONTO THE FIRE 
AND LET IT ALL COOK TOGETHER 
AND NOW WE CUT OUR GOOSE INTO PIECES 
SMITE HIM INTO PIECES AS IT SAYS IN THE BOOK 
SEE THIS LOVELY GOOSE LOOK AT THAT 
ONLY THE BEST FOR THE KING 
JUST GIVE THIS A LITTLE STIR 
AND NOW FOR THE SAUCE MADAME 
WHICH I'M GOING TO PUT OVER THE GOOSE 
AND THERE WE ARE 
AND NOW AS THE BOOK SAYS AND SERVE IT FORTH 
EXPENSIVE AND SOPHISTICATED CUISINE 
LIKE FOOD LIKE MONARCH 
AS RICHARD GREW UP HE BECAME KNOWN AS THE DANDY KING 
THE KING WHO BROUGHT US THE POCKET HANDKERCHIEF 
HE INSISTED ON BATHING AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK 
HE WAS A FLAMBOYANT DRESSER AND INTERESTINGLY TO ME 
HE TOOK TO EATING IN HIS PRIVATE CHAMBERS 
EAGER TO BE ALOOF FROM HIS COURT 
IT WAS ALL ABOUT APPEARANCES 
HISTORIANS PAINT HIM AS A PETULANT 
NARCISSISTIC KING SEEKING TO CREATE A MYSTIQUE AROUND HIS MAJESTY 
BUT HE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HAD TO BOW TO THE POWER OF THE CHURCH 
HE LEFT US A COOKBOOK 
BUT IT WAS THE CHURCH THAT DICTATED WHAT HE ATE 
TO ADHERE TO RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE 
RICHARD AND HIS COURT NEEDED TO EAT LOTS AND LOTS OF FISH 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE CHURCH RIGOROUSLY INSISTED THAT THERE 
WAS SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO DAYS THAT WERE FASTING AND ABSTINENCE A YEAR 
THAT IS DAYS WHEN YOU COULDN'T EAT MEAT 
AND SO OBVIOUSLY THEY ATE A LOT OF FISH 
THIS LED TO MEDIEVAL FISH FARMING AND RICHARD WAS FAMOUS 
FOR HIS WELL STOCKED FISH PONDS OR AS THEY CALLED THEM STEW PONDS 
NEVERTHELESS HAVING TO EAT FISH SO MANY DAYS OF THE YEAR 
LED TO SOME CLEVER RE WRITING OF CREATURE CLASSIFICATION 
OF COURSE IF YOU WERE RICH AND YOU REALLY GOT BORED WITH FISH 
YOU GOT ALL SORTS OF DISPENSATIONS 
BEAVER FOR INSTANCE BECAUSE IT LIVED IN THE WATER 
WAS CONSIDERED FISH 
BUT FISH IT WAS FOR MORE THAN HALF THE YEAR 
SO THE CHEFS HAD TO BE VERY CREATIVE 
THE RECIPES IN RICHARD'S COOKBOOK DETAIL A HUGE ARRAY OF INGREDIENTS 
PARTICULARLY MENTION THE JEWELS OF HIS COURTLY CUISINE EXOTIC SPICES 
AND THEY'RE CENTRAL TO THE NEXT RECIPE I'VE CHOSEN TO COOK 
IT'S ONE I'VE TASTED MANY TIMES IN THE MARKETS OF SPAIN 
SO I'M THRILLED TO FIND IT IN THE FORME OF CURY 
TODAY IT'S CALLED ESCABECHE OR SWEET AND SOUR FISH 
EGRE DAUCE OF FISH TAKE ROACHES OTHER TENCHES OTHER SOLES 
SMITE HIM IN PIECES 
FIRST OF ALL I'M GOING TO MAKE A SYRUP 
I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME VINEGAR 
WHITE WINE VINEGAR 
AND IN IT JUST LIKE MAKING A SYRUP TODAY 
I'M GOING TO PUT SOME SUGAR 
SUGAR WAS AN EXTREME LUXURY IN THOSE DAYS 
SOMETHING SO EXPENSIVE THAT LIBERAL USE OF IT WAS MOST UNEXPECTED 
THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE THESE REALLY EXPENSIVE SPICES 
WE HAVE SOME ETHIOPIAN PEPPER 
KNOWN HAPPILY BY THE NAME OF GRAINS OF PARADISE 
I'VE GOT SOME GROUND GINGER 
GINGER OF COURSE CAME ALL THE WAY FROM THE FAR EAST 
IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF DISTANCE IT HAD TO TRAVEL 
BY HORSEBACK MULEBACK CAMELBACK EVERYTHING ELSE TO GET TO ENGLAND 
A BIT OF GROUND CINNAMON 
AND SOME CLOVES ALL THE WAY FROM THE SPICE ISLANDS 
A LONG LONG WAY TO COME 
LET'S PUT A BIT OF BARK CINNAMON IN AS WELL 
JUST TO PROVE WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING 
AND NOW I'M GOING TO ADD SOME CHOPPED ONIONS FINELY MINCED 
AS THEY SAY IN THE COOKERY BOOK 
AND SOME CURRANTS JUST ORDINARY LITTLE CURRANTS 
SOME SULTANAS WHICH ARE MUCH FULLER AND PLUMPER AND JUICIER 
AND MORE EXPENSIVE 
THEY WOULD HAVE COME FROM THE ISLE OF CYPRUS AS THE CURRANTS 
ALL OF THAT HANDLED BY THE EARLY VENETIAN TRADING COMPANY 
ALONG WITH THE SUGAR 
AND NOW I'M GOING TO COOK THE FISH 
SO SOME SOME PIKE 
NICE LONG FILLET OF PIKE 
THE SOLES OF COURSE ARE SALTWATER FISH 
THERE'S A NICE BIT OF ROE IN THIS ONE HERE 
PART OF THE REASON FOR USING DIFFERENT FISHES IS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TEXTURES 
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT FLAVOURS AND IN THE CASE OF THE ROACH 
THEY HAVE AN OILINESS ABOUT THEM 
WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER TWO 
WHICH ARE WHITE FISH AND PLAIN 
AND A DIFFERENT COLOUR 
THEN SIMPLY FRY IN A PAN 
THEY USED OLIVE OIL BY THE WAY 
AND THERE WE ARE THERE'S OUR FISH PIECES ALL NICELY COOKED 
I'M JUST GOING TO TIP THE SWEET AND SOUR SYRUP WITH ITS ONIONS 
AND CURRANTS ALL OVER THE FISH 
AND THERE IT IS READY TO GO OUT TO THE TABLE 
DELICIOUS 
FIT FOR A KING WITH THOSE EXOTIC SPICES 
LOOK AT THIS 
ISN'T THIS WONDERFUL 
THIS GREAT MEDIEVAL HALL THE MOST BRILLIANT SPACE 
THE KING'S TABLE 
THE HEAD TABLE AT THE TOP 
AND THEN STRETCHING BEFORE US THE TABLES 
AND THE SERVERS WOULD COME FROM THE KITCHEN 
BEARING THE GREAT DISHES 
AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE SERVED 
AND THE CHEFS MADE SURE THAT EVERYTHING 
WAS A PAGEANT OF A PICTURE IN THE ROYAL COURT 
RICHARD WAS NOT ONLY A CONNOISSEUR OF GOOD FOOD 
HE WAS ALSO A STICKLER FOR ETIQUETTE AND MANNERS 
WHICH INCLUDED HANDS BEING THOROUGHLY WASHED 
BEFORE A MEAL COULD BEGIN 
AND IN RICHARD'S COURT THE USE OF CUTLERY REIGNED 
PARTICULARLY THE SPOON 
THEY WERE SUCH PRIZED POSSESSIONS 
THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD CARRIED THEM EVERYWHERE THEY WENT 
THE COURT OBSERVED STRICT RULES ON TABLE MANNERS 
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED THAT IT WAS NOT A KNEES UP IN A TAVERN 
BUT MORE LIKE FINE DINING 
WHILST THE COURTIERS ATE THE KITCHEN WORKED TIRELESSLY 
COOKING AND CLEANING AS FOOD WAS SENT OUT ALL THE TIME 
ONE RECIPE I FOUND IN THE FORME OF CURY READS 
LIKE A CLASSIC MODERN PUDDING 
ALL OF US WILL HAVE EATEN A VERSION OF IT PROBABLY 
BUT SO DID RICHARD THE SECOND 
HERE'S HIS PEARS POACHED IN RED WINE 
PEARS IN CONFIT 
TAKE PEARS AND PARE HIM CLEAN 
TAKE GOOD RED WINE AND MULBERRIES 
AND SEEP THE PEARS THEREIN 
HERE ARE SOME WARDEN PEARS 
ALL BEAUTIFULLY PEELED WHICH I'VE PUT IT INTO A NICE LITTLE DISH 
AND HERE I HAVE SOME MULBERRIES 
THESE ARE DRIED WHITE MULBERRIES BUT THEY'LL DO FOR THE FLAVOUR 
AND FOR THE COLOURING SOME BLACKBERRIES 
INTO THIS DISH I'M GOING TO POUR SOME RED WINE 
AND PUT IT ONTO THE FIRE TO COOK 
NOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS ADD VARIOUS THINGS TO THE WINE 
THEN REDUCE IT DOWN AND THAT WILL BE THE SAUCE FOR THE PEARS 
HONEY WAS ONE OF THE GREAT SWEETENERS OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
THEY KEPT A LOT OF HIVES BECAUSE 
NOT ONLY WAS THE HONEY USED IN COOKERY 
BUT THE WAX WAS USED IN CANDLES 
CHURCH CANDLES CANDLES TO LIGHT THE KING'S GREAT HALL 
ALL THAT SORT OF THING 
SO BEES WERE BIG BUSINESS 
AND TO THIS I'M ALSO GOING TO ADD POWDERED GINGER 
NOW I'LL SIT HERE AND DO NOTHING 
THERE ARE MOMENTS IN THE COOK'S LIFE 
EVEN A MEDIEVAL COOK'S LIFE WHEN YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT 
PATIENCE IS A GREAT VIRTUE FOR COOKS 
NOT NECESSARILY CHEFS BUT FOR COOKS 
MM SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL 
THERE IT GOES AS IT SAYS MESS IT FORTH 
HOT OR COLD 
RICHARD ATE BETTER THAN ALMOST ANY ENGLISH KING 
FOOD LIKE THIS COST A FORTUNE 
ONE FEAST IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE IS RECORDED AS COSTING FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOR FOOD 
AND TEN THOUSAND FOR NAPERY AND FOR SPICES 
A STAGGERING AMOUNT 
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THIS STANDARD OF LIVING 
HE TAXED HIS SUBJECTS HORRENDOUSLY TO THE HILT 
AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT 
WHAT'S MORE HE BEGAN TO LOSE SUPPORT IN HIS COURT AND PARLIAMENT 
RICHARD IGNORED THEM AND FAMOUSLY DECLAIMED 
I WILL NOT DISMISS ONE SCULLION FROM MY KITCHEN 
AT PARLIAMENT'S REQUEST 
DISILLUSIONED NOBLEMEN SOON CONSPIRED AGAINST HIM 
RICHARD RETALIATED BRUTALLY EITHER KILLING OR EXILING THE REBELS 
BUT THE CLOCK WAS TICKING FOR ENGLAND'S KING 
BEFORE HIS TALE ENDS HOWEVER 
I'M EAGER TO DISCOVER HOW RICHARD'S CUISINE TASTES TODAY 
SO I'VE INVITED KATE CAHOUN FOOD WRITER 
CHRIS WOOLGAR MEDIEVAL ARCHIVIST 
MICHELLE BERRIEDALE JOHNSON FOOD HISTORIAN 
AND KEEPER OF THE FORME OF CURY AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY CLAIRE BREAY TO DINE WITH ME 
FIRST THE KING'S SIGNATURE DISH 
SAUCE MADAME 
WELL WE HAVE COOKED OUR GOOSE FOR YOU 
THIS IS GOOSE WITH SAUCE MADAME 
IT DOES SMELL FANTASTIC 
IT DOES SMELL GOOD DOESN'T IT 
SILENCE IS ALWAYS GOOD WHEN PEOPLE ARE EATING 
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT AS RICH AS YOU NORMALLY EXPECT GOOSE TO BE 
THIS MUST BE PARTLY TO DO WITH THE STUFFING 
THAT IT HAS DRAWN THE RICHNESS OUT 
ACTUALLY TASTE DON'T THEY 
OFTEN WHEN COOKED THEY GO ROPEY BUT THESE ARE SHARP 
WARDEN PEARS ALL OF THOSE FLAVOURS ALTOGETHER 
IT'S FLASH COOKING REALLY IT ALL LOOKS VERY BEAUTIFUL 
BUT NOT FLASHY BUT IT TASTES FLASHY 
SO MUCH FOR BLAND ENGLISH FOOD 
ABSOLUTELY 
NOW FOR RICHARD'S LUXURIOUS SWEET AND SOUR FISH RECIPE 
EGRE DAUCE OF FISH 
ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH INTERESTS ME WITH THIS 
IS HOW MUCH FISH THEY ATE 
AT LEAST HALF THE DAYS IN THE YEAR ARE FISH DAYS 
THERE'S A WONDERFUL LITTLE PIECE IN A FOURTEENTH CENTURY SCHOOL BOOK 
BY A VERY YOUNG BOY WHERE 
AT THE END OF LENT AT THE END OF EATING NOTHING BUT FISH 
HE WRITES IN HIS MARGIN THOU WILL NOT BELIEVE HOW WEARY I AM OF FISH 
HOW MUCH I DESIRE THAT FLESH WERE COME IN AGAIN 
THIS IS VERY SPECIAL FISH 
THIS IS FRESHWATER FISH WHICH CARRIES A PREMIUM 
SO TO HAVE PIKE IS VERY SPECIAL INDEED 
IT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO DAYS' WAGES 
FINALLY A SEVEN HUNDRED YEAR OLD FRIEND POACHED PEARS 
PEARS IN CONFIT 
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL 
YOU'VE GOT THAT WONDERFUL 
LOVELY RED OUTSIDE WITH THE PURE PEAR INSIDE FANTASTIC 
PEARS WERE A VERY COMMON END TO THE MEAL 
IN UPPER CLASS ESTABLISHMENTS IN ENGLAND 
THEY EAT THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE BELIEVED TO HELP DIGESTION 
LOOKING AT THESE BOOKS AND HAVING IT COOKED 
AND TALKING ABOUT IT ACTUALLY MAKES YOU REALISE HOW SIMILAR WE ARE IN SO MANY WAYS 
IT'S THOSE POINTS OF CONNECTION IN HISTORY THAT ARE SO SPARKY 
AND MAKE YOU THINK I UNDERSTAND THAT PERIOD A LITTLE BIT MORE 
IT BRINGS YOU SO MUCH CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES 
YOU CAN IMAGINE YOURSELF IN THE KITCHEN 
MANY MEDIEVAL COOKS WERE EXACTLY LIKE US 
IT MAKES IT ALL COME ALIVE 
WHAT I TAKE FROM THIS MEAL IS 
THE TASTES THE FLAVOURS THE THINGS I CANNOT GET FROM THE MANUSCRIPT 
IT'S THE IMAGINATION THAT BRINGS IT TOGETHER AND TURNS INTO SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL 
THIS BRINGS IT TO LIFE IN A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION YOU ENJOYED IT 
I THINK ENJOYMENT JUST REDOUBLES EVERYTHING 
TO EAT SOMETHING THAT I'D IMAGINED IN AN ESOTERIC WAY 
AND FIND IT IS NOT ONLY GOOD BUT ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
IT HAS BEEN SPLENDID THANK YOU HOORAY 
RICHARD'S END WAS LESS GLORIOUS THAN HIS FOOD 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE THE COUSIN HE EXILED 
RETURNED IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE TO CLAIM THE THRONE 
AND RICHARD WAS SOON CAPTURED AND INCARCERATED 
STRIPPED OF HIS MAJESTY RICHARD DIED AT THE AGE OF THIRTY THREE 
A PREMATURE DEATH PERHAPS BUT HIS LEGACY IS RICHER 
ENGLAND'S OLDEST KNOWN COOKBOOK 
RICHARD THE SECOND IS DEAD IRONICALLY FOR SUCH A HEDONIST STARVED TO DEATH 
A TERRIBLE THOUGHT 
BUT HIS COOKBOOK REMAINS 
FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE LEFT TO SAVOUR AND TASTE THE ABUNDANCE 
THE KING IS DEAD LONG LIVE THE COOK 
HALF COMMUNE HALF ROCK BAND 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD CHANGE THE WORLD 
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GROUP 
WE LIVE TOGETHER BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THESE TWO SEVERLY AUTISTIC CHILDREN 
HAD PIONEERING THERAPY TO HELP THEM SPEAK 
WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT APPLE 
THIS POLITICIAN WASN'T TAKING ANY PRISONERS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
YOU EITHER BE KILLED BY THEM OR KILL THEM I WANT TO SEE THEM DEAD 
AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIFTEEN PEOPLE SPENT AN ENTIRE YEAR LIVING IN THE IRON AGE 
BREAKFAST WAS ALMOST ALWAYS A PORRIDGE OF BOILED WHEAT WITH MILK 
AND HONEY IF THERE WAS ANY 
NOW A NEW SERIES CATCHES UP WITH THE CHARACTERS 
FROM SOME OF THE BEST B. B. C. DOCUMENTARIES OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS 
AND FINDS OUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
