A P. R. DISASTER THE FIRST SCUFFLES 
STARTED A WEMBLEY STADIUM WHEN A 
PROTESTOR TRIED TO SNATCH THE TORCH 
THEN KONNIE HUQ WAS WRESTLED AS SHE 
HELD THE FLAME 
THERE WERE EIGHT DISRUPTIONS WHAT 
HAS YESTERDAY COST LONDON HERE IS 
AGREEAN WARNER 
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A JOURNEY OF 
HARMONY BUT IT WAS LIKE GETTING 
ACROSS LONDON IN A TUBE STRIKE 
THIS ISN'T VERY GOOD FOR THE 
OLYMPIC MOVEMENT FIRSTLY BECAUSE 
THEY WANT THE TORCH TO BE ABOUT 
GALVAN ICING SUPPORT AND GETTING 
PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT THE GAMES 
THEY WERE GETTING ANGRY YESTERDAY 
AND OF COURSE THIS TORCH RELAY IS 
BECOMING MORE AND MORE ABOUT CHINA 
AND NOT ABOUT THE OLYMPICS FOR 
LONDON IT WASN'T GREAT AT SHOWING 
OFF OUR GREAT VENUES BECAUSE 
PICTURES WENT AROUND THE WORLD OF 
JUST POLICE TAUG BEE TACKLING 
PROTESTERS AND GENERAL PROTEST 
SHOTS GOINGEN AROUND THE WORLD AND 
MOST IMPORTANTLY THE MAGIC WASN'T 
THERE THE TORCH IS ABOUT GETTING 
PEOPLE CLOSE TO THAT MAGICICAL 
FLAME THAT HAS INSPIRED A LOT OF 
PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IT WAS 
ON A BUS WE SEE BUSES GOING PAST 
US EVERY DAY DON'T WE 
WHAT HAVE 
PEOPLE BEEN SAYING TODAY 
INTERESTING I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO 
PEOPLE HEREMENT THEY ARE SAYING IT 
IS RIGHT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE 
THE RIGHT TO PROTEST IN THIS 
COUNTRY COUNTRY I THINK THINK IT WAS A GOOD ADVERT 
FOR LONDONMENT IT IS A GOOD IDEA 
THAT PEOPLE CAN PROTEST FREELY 
I WOULDN'T SAY SO REALLY 
THE PEOPLE BEING ATTACKED 
YES I THINK IT WAS REALLY TO BRING 
IT TO LIGHT TO PEOPLE WHAT'S 
HAPPENING IN CHINA YES 
WHAT WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR THE 
REPUTATION OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS I I HAVE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE TODAY IN THE 
OLYMPIC MOVEMENT THEY SAID THIS IS 
AN EXCEPTION THERE WILL BE 
DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
BUT NOT ON THIS KIND OF SCALE 
THANK YOU 
A GROCERY STORE IN SOUTH WEST 
LONDON IS SELLING CANNABIS SWEETS 
OVER THE COUNTER TO CHILDREN IT IS 
LEGAL AS THE HEMP BASED SWEET 
CONTAINS NONE OF THE ACTIVE 
INGREDIENTS FOUND IN THE DRUG BUT 
IT CAUSED OUTRAGE AMONG PARENTS 
PARAIC O'BRIEN REPORTS 
LONDIS LOCALLY BEST FOR 
CONFECTIONERY CONFECTIONERY CANNABIS IS HEMP BASED PASTEL 
MADE IN IN SWITZERLAND ONE MOTHER 
THINKS IT SHOULDN'T BUT AT LEAST 
NOT ON THE SWEET COUNTER 
IT IS TRADING ON A NAME WHICH IS 
THE NAME OF A SOFT DRUG ONE OF THE 
MANY NAMES OF SOFT DRUGS AND IT 
DESCEND SATISES CHILDREN TO THE TO 
THE FACT THAT IT IS SOMETHING THEY 
NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS OF 
THIS WOMAN IS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL 
AND IS PERSUASIVE SOON OTHER MUMS 
ARE TRYING SOME CANNABIS 
IT IS DESIGNED TO THINK THAT 
CANNABIS IS COOL 
IT IS LIKE OLD FASHIONED COULD YOU 
HAVE MIXTUREMENT 
IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA 
THE WEET IS MADE BY A COMPANY 
CALLED SWISS MINTS AND THEY TOLD US 
THAT CANNABIS IS THE LATIN NAME FOR 
THE HEMP FLOWER 
ON BARNES GREEN GREEN IT WASN'T 
LONG BEFORE ONE OF THE MOTHERS WAS 
CHOSEN AS THE SPOKESPERSON AND WAS 
SENT INTO THE SHOP 
YOU HAVE GOT THESE SWEETS AT THE 
FRONT COUNTER AND DO YOU THINK IT 
IS APPROPRIATE THAT YOU HAVE THEM 
AT THE FRONT COUNTER BEING SOLD TO 
CHILDREN 
NOT REALLY FOR THE CHILDREN CHILDREN CHILDREN AN ERROR OF JUDGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE 
ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IT DOESN'T GO 
WITH KIDS AND SWEETS HAVE 
INSTRUCTED THE MANAGER TO TAKE IT 
OFF THE SHELVES 
TODAY THE TRADING STANDARDS TOLD 
US THEY ARE WITH THE SCHOOL RUN 
MUMS ON THIS ONE AND DON'T CONDONE 
THE USE OF THE WORD CANNABIS IN 
CONNECTION WITH SWEETS A 
WHO STOLE OVER ONE 
A SOLICITOR WHO STOLE OVER ONE MILLION FROM A PERSONAL INJURY 
CLIENT HAS BEEN JAILED FOR TEN 
YEARS KEITH ANDERSON WAS AWARDED 
COMPENSATION AFTER BEING PARALYSE 
INDEED A CAR CRASH ON THE THE A TWENTY THREE 
TOMORROW MASS MCGOLDRICK WAS 
CONVICTED OF FIFTY THREE CHARGES INCLUDING 
FALSE ACCOUNTING FORGERY AND MONEY 
LAUNDERING LAUNDERING BRIAN PADDICK HAS PROMISE TODAY 
BETTER TRANSPORT MORE AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING AND SAFER LONDON IF HE IS 
ELECTED MAYOR AT HIS MANIFESTO 
LAUNCH HE SAID HE WOULD LISTEN 
CAREFULLY TO LONDONERS CONCERNS 
BUT HE CAME UNDER PRESSURE TO SAY 
WHICH OF HIS OPPONENTS POLICIES HE 
WAS CLOSER TO 
A CONTRACT WITH LONDON AS IS HOW HE 
PUT IT BRIAN PADDICK SAYS HE IS 
THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO REALLY 
LISTENS TO LONDON'S CONCERNS ON ON PAST PERFORMANCE DO THEY REALLY 
TRUST THE CURRENT MAYOR TO RUN 
LONDON IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL 
LONDONERS COULD BE REALLY TRUST 
THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE ON PAST 
PERFORMANCE TO RUN ANYTHING AT 
ALL ALL BUT HE IS UNDER PRESSURE TO MAKE 
MORE HEADWAY AFTER POOR SHOWING 
IN THE POLLS SO FAR SURELY HE 
COULD SAY IF NOT HIM WHICH OF KEN 
OR BORIS HE WOULD PREFER 
I AM 
HAVING REAL PERSONAL PROBLEMS ABOUT 
WHO OUT OF THE TWO IF I HAD TO 
MAKE A DECISION THOUGH I WOULD GO 
FOR 
BORIS JOHNSON'S MOST NOTABLE FOR ATTEMPT TO DATE TO PLAY THE GAME OF 
FOOTBALL WAS ANYTHING BUT BEAUTIFUL 
TODAY WITH THE CHELSEA YOUTH SQUAD 
HE DECLINED INVITATIONS TO SHOW HIS 
BALL SKILLS 
THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK 
OF HUMILIATION HERE I THINK IF I 
TRY TO DEMONSTRATE MY CLINICAL 
FINISHING 
HE DID PRODUCE A LIST OF FINISHING TEN'S BROKEN PROMISES BUT THEN BROKE 
ONE OF HIS OWN PARTY'S KEN'S 
BROKEN PROMISES 
THE MAYOR OF 
LONDON DOES NOT CONTROL IMMIGRATION 
AND HE DOES NOT CONTROL OUR BORDERS 
BUT IT IS HIS JOB TO SPEAK UP ON 
BEHALF OF THE LONDON TAXPAYER AND 
LONDON BOROUGHS WHO ARE FEELING 
THE EFFECTS OF UNFUNDED UNCOUNTED 
IMMIGRATION 
KEN LIVINGSTONE TODAY IMMIGRATION VOWED TO CONSULT ON TWENTY M. P. H. SPEED 
LIMITS ON ALL RESIDENTIAL ROADS IF IF YOU ARE HIT BY A CAR TRAVELLING AT 
FORTY M. P. H. NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN YOU 
WILL DIE IF YOU ARE HIT BY A CAR 
TRAVELLING AT TWENTY M. P. H. THERE IS ONE 
CHANCE IN TWENTY THAT YOU WILL DIE 
BORIS JOHNSON SAID TWENTY M. P. H. ON THE 
CAPITAL'S GRIDLOCKED STREETS 
CHANCE WOULD BE A FINE THING 
IT IS OF COURSE JUST OVER THREE 
WEEKS UNTIL LONDONERS GO TO THE 
POLLS AND THE CANDIDATES FIND OUT 
HOW EFFECTIVE THEIR CAMPAIGNS HAVE 
BEEN IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE 
LOOKING AT THE MAIN ISSUES FACING 
THEM AND WHAT DIFFERENT INTEREST 
GROUPS WANT IN THE FIRST OF OUR 
ELECTION SPECIALS VICTORIA HOLLINS 
HAS FOUND OUT WHAT IS ON 
BUSINESSES' WISH LISTS 
LONDON THE LEADING FINANCIAL CITY 
CONTRIBUTING TWO HUNDRED BILLION TO THE 
ECONOMY EVERY YEAR PROVIDING FOR 
ZERO POINT SIX MILLION JOBS THE MAYOR 
NOT HAVE DIRECT POWER OVER BUSINESS 
BUT HE IS CHARGED WITH CREATING THE 
RIGHT ENVIRONMENT TO BRING IT HERE 
FOR OH SIX MILLION JOBS HE HAS 
POWER OVER TRANSPORT AND HE CAN 
MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO GET TO 
WORK AND DO BUSINESS HERE FOR OH SIX 
MILLION MILLION THEY DO IT IS PUTTING UP MORE TWELVE 
BUILDINGS OR BUILDING MORE 
AFFORDABLE HOMES MORE TALL 
BUILDINGS HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
KILL SKILLS AND TRAINING MAKING 
SURE WE HAVE A QUALIFIED WORKFORCE 
TAKE TWO BUSINESSES BIG AND SMALL 
OR DO THEY WANT FROM THE MAYOR 
WHAT DO THEY WANT THIS LADY HAS 
RUN A BUSINESS FOR TWENTY YEARS WE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO REPORT EASILY AND 
QUICKLY BUSINESS CRIME THE 
CONGESTION CHARGE AND TRANSPORT 
WHY CAN'T SMALL BUSINESSES WITH 
CENTRAL BUSINESS CARS BE TREATED 
EXACTLY THE SAME AS RESIDENTS AND 
PAY A LOWER RATE THAT WOULD HELP 
SMALLER BUSINESSES IN LONDON THE 
THIRD THING IS VITAL THAT'S 
AFFORDABLE BUSINESS ACCOMMODATION 
THE THREE KEY TARGETS IN THE NEXT 
TERM FOR THE MAYOR ARE TO CONTINUE 
TO WORK ON THE TRANSPORT AGENDA DO 
NOT LET UP ON THE IMPROVEMENTS IN 
THE TUBE SECONDLY ON SKILLS WE 
HAVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNEMPLOYED WE MUST 
GET THEM BACK TO WORK THIRDLY WE 
HAVE GOT TO GET A LEGACY FROM THE 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GAMES

SHANGHAI AND THEN AS FILA TO 
ATTRACT BUSINESS BORIS JOHNSON 
SAYS HE WILL GET RID OF THEM AND 
VENEZUELA KEN LIVINGSTONE SAYS THE 
OLYMPICS WILL COME IN ON BUDGET AND 
BRING THIRTY THOUSAND NEW JOBS BRIAN 
PADDICK IS PLEDGING TO SCRAP THE 
WEST EXTENSION TO THE CONGESTION 
CHARGE BUSINESSES NEED CONVINCING

CAPITAL WE WERE GETTING NO 
MOVEMENT ON ANYTHING BEFORE TWO THOUSAND
