PHIL MICKELSON 
HAS WON TWICE IN THE LAST FOUR 
YEARS BUT GOT INTO A SPOT OF BOTHER 
ON THE FIRST 
SOMEWHERE IN THE 
CROWD IS MICKELSON LEFT WITH A 
VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE SHOT WHAT CAN YOU SAY I HOPE HE HAS THE 
GOOD GRACE TO LOOK SHY 
EXTRAORDINARY STUFF HE WENT ON TO 
BIRDIE THE SECOND AS WELL FOUR 
TIMES WINNER TIGER WOODS HAD A TESTING OPENING POT OPENING POT HE IS NOT BAD AT TESTING PUTTS FOR 
PAR HE CONTINUED TO MAKE PAR BUT 
WAS IN TROUBLE AT THE SEVENTH IT STOPS IN TIME IT DID NOT GOING 
BUT THAT WAS A WONDERFUL RESULT 
IT DID NOT GOING 
TIGER PARDEW 
FIRST TWELVE HOLES BUT BEHIND THE PAR 
SO FIVE THIRTEENTH HE MADE A MESS OF 
THINGS HE EVENTUALLY MADE A BOGEY SIX AND 
TIGER WAS ONE OVER PAR MORE 
PROBLEMS FOR TIGER AT FOURTEEN THIS LONG 
PUTT WAS FOR A PAR NOT ENOUGH LEGS 
TIGER MUST TWO OVER PAR AND SIX 
SHOTS BEHIND THE LEADER TIGER 
RHYS TWO OVER PAR TIGER IS AND 
THAT BRINGS YOU BANG UP TO DATE 
WE ARE WAITING FOR OUR AMERICAN 
COLLEAGUES TO BRING THE LIVE 
COVERAGE SO WE WILL BE OUT THERE 
FOR THE ACTION AS SOON AS THEY DO 
WE HAVE SEEN SOME WONDERFUL GOLF ON 
DAY ONE OF THE MASTERS 
I WAS 
EXPECTING THAT THE SCORING TO BE A 
LITTLE LOWER THAN IT HAS BEEN 
THE GREEN THE PINS ARE TUCKED AWAY 
PERFECT CONDITIONS L. EXPECTED THE 
SCORING TO BE PERHAPS A BIT LOWER 
SO DID I BUT THE PIN POSITIONS ARE 
VERY TIGHT AND THAT MAKES IT 
DIFFICULT WE HAVE NOT HAD MANY 
CHEERS OUT OF THERE ALL DAY EXCEPT 
FOR IAN POULTER'S HOLE IN ONE 
TIGER WOODS HAS SYSTEM HAS YET TO 
MAKE A BIRDIE AND HAS GOT A BOGEY 
ON THE LAST TWO 
HIS SCORING 
AVERAGE OVER THE LAST YEAR IS NOT 
THAT GOOD L. HEARD SOME CHEERS IT IT IS EARLY DAYS TIGER HAS DRIFTED 
AND NOT STARTED THAT WELL ON MANY 
OCCASIONS AND COME BACK TO WIN 
THAT IS RIGHT WHETHER HE IS IN THE 
FIELD EVERY PLAYER KNOWS WHAT 
SCHOOL HE IS ON 
THEY WILL REMEMBER 
THE FIRST I HE WAS HERE IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
THE FIRST TIME HE WON BY TWELVE O. K. O. K. WE CAN HEAD OUT FOR SOME LIVE GOLF 
WITH COMMENTATORS PETER ALLISS AND 
SAM TORRANCE YOU'RE WELCOME TO THIS FIRST DAY OF 
THE MASTERS SPONSORED BY A. T. AND AMP T. 
THEY'RE OUT THERE ENJOYING THE SUN 
ALONG WITH FORTY THOUSAND OTHER PEOPLE THE 
COURSE HAS NOT BEEN QUITE AS GOOD 
IT IS LONG OWL SEVEN THOUSAND YARDS IT IS 
LONG NOW THE GREENS ARE VERY FAST HE LOVES THOSE LITTLE ONES JUST A 
LAST MINUTE GASP IN SHE GOES AND 
BACK TO LEVEL 
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY 
HE TOOK THE BEAUTIFUL SHOT TO PLAY 
BACK TO LEVEL PAR IT JUST DROPPED 
IN GREAT CONTROL GREEN NERVE 
THAT IS WHY HE IS NUMBER ONE IN THE 
WORLD BACK TO LEVEL FOUR BEHIND 
JUSTIN ROSE 
HE REALLY IS 
EXTRAORDINARY SEE HOW BOLDLY YOU 
PLAYED THE SHOT THEN IT GRABS AND 
THEN GRAVITY TAKES OVER L. WOULD 
NOT BE SURPRISED IF HE GOT ANOTHER 
BIRDIE THE BEST FINISHED SCORE SO 
FAR IS SEVENTY AT THIS MOMENT PAR SEVENTY TWO 
JUSTIN ROSE HAS A CHANCE OF 
BREAKING THE SEVENTY BARRIER BUT THERE 
WILL NOT BE MANY ALL IN ALL IT IS ALL BUBBLING UP 
FOREHEAD VERY SPLENDID FOUR DAYS OF 
GOLF FOR A VERY SPLENDID IT IS SITTING UP O. K. COULD GO FROM 
THE GREEN BUT IT IS AN AWKWARD 
STANCE IT WILL BE TRICKY 
THERE IS HOW THINGS STAND CURRENTLY 
TIGER WAS EXTRAORDINARY JUST AS 
YOU THINK IT MIGHT NOT BE IN THIS 
YEAR HE DOES SOMETHING SPECIAL 
FROM BEHIND THAT FIFTEENTH GREEN VERY 
TOUGH SHOT THE GRASS HAS LIE 
AGAINST YOU IT IS SO EASY TO MISS 
IT WAS A DELIGHT HE ALWAYS SEEMS TO COME UP WITH 
SOMETHING JUST WHEN HE NEEDS TO 
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW DIFFICULT TO 
TEARS AROUND HERE 
HE DID NOT QUITE 
GET THE LOGO RIGHT LIKE HE DID TWO 
YEARS AGO 
HE IS FANTASTIC 
IMMEDIATELY HE HAS TURNED HIS DAY 
AROUND ONE SHOT 
THE OTHER STORY OF THE DAY IS 
JUSTIN ROSE TWO WERE OVER AFTER 
FIVE HOLES 
LAST YEAR HE WAS FOUR 
OVER AFTER FOUR HOLES A TREMENDOUS 
RUN AROUND L. WAS WATCHING HIS 
PUTTING STROKE AND PARTICULARLY 
AROUND THE LOOP A DEALER IT 
LOOKS ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON WHEN THE 
BALL WHEN THE BALL IS ROLLING OFF 
THE PUTTER FACE A GOOD EFFORT 
FOUR UNDER PAR HE IS OUR MAIN HOPE 
I THINK 
AND LAST YEAR IT SEEMS 
LIKE HE LIKES THIS GOLF COURSE AND 
IT IS A GREAT SCORE IT IS A GREAT 
HORSE TO HAVE AN AFFINITY WITH HE HE HAS LEARNED HERE ON THURSDAYS 
FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS SO HE DOES 
ENJOY IT 
LOTS OF PLAYERS ARE STILL

DELAYED FOR AN HOUR THIS MORNING WE WILL BE FOLLOWING THESE PLAYERS THESE ARE LIVE SCORES AT THE BOTTOM STEVE STRICKER IS MUCH FANCIED ALL THESE PLAYERS WILL BE FINISHING 
THEIR ROUNDS A LOT LATER THEY ARE 
LATE STARTERS IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE 
FINAL GROUP WILL FINISH BEFORE 
DARKNESS THIS EVENING LEE WESTWOOD 
IS IN THE FINAL GROUP WE WILL STAY 
WITH IT AS LONG AS THE GOLF IS OUT 
THERE BEST MOMENT OF THE DAY IN IT 
SO FAR IS SIMPLE TO IS BEING 
ABLE TO IAN POULTER 
HE HAD TO HOP FORWARD HE DID IT 
ENOUGH HE IS STRIKING THE BALL WELL TODAY 
AROUND IN SEVENTY AND THIRTY ONE PUTTS THIS IS

BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED EXCELLENT SHOT 
HIS CADDIE WILL BE PLEASED WITH 
THAT UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE YOU HAD TO USE LOCAL 
CADDIES THEY WERE VERY GOOD BUT

GROWN PLENTY OF YEARS IF YOU HIT 
ONE A BIT LOW YOU CAN CLATTER INTO 
THOSE BRANCHES IT MAY BE O. K. THAT IS A GREAT SHOT A GREAT SHOT 
FROM WESTWOOD HE'S SWINGING BETTER 
THAN HE HAS EVER DONE THIS IS PROBABLY THE HARDEST HOLE IN THE COURSE THEY GET ON SLIPPING THE TEE 
FURTHER AND FURTHER BACK THEY 
KEPT ON THAT IS MAGNIFICENT BUT IT IS RUNNING ON WE SAW TIGER PUTT FROM THERE IT IS TREACHEROUSLY QUICK EXCELLENT TWO AT THE SIX OR JIM 
FURYK AT SIXTH FOR JIM FURYK BEAUTY HE GETS THE DROP SHOT BACK ONE UNDER PAR GOOD PUTT VERY GOOD PUTT HE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING BIT OF LATE THE HE COULD HAVE DONE WITH A LITTLE EXTRA SPEED JUST A FRACTION HIGH A COUPLE OF

NOT OFTEN YOU SEE A PUTT SHORT AT 
AUGUSTA THAT WAS GREAT OPENING 
ROUND FOR THE DEFENDING CHAMPION 
SEVENTY WHAT A MOMENT FOR HIM A YEAR 
AGO HE WON HIS FIRST MAJOR HE 
PLAYED GREAT IN THE LAST ROUND HE IS TIED FOR THE CLUBHOUSE LEAD 
WITH IAN POULTER AND ROBERT 
KARLSSON HE MAY BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT HAS REACHED THE EIGHTH IN TWO SO FAR TODAY IF YOU LITTLE SNIDE REMARKS 
APPEARING ON THE GREENS IF YOU 
LITTLE BITE MARKS THAT WAS A QUICK STROKED AND 
STRAIGHT IN A QUICK STROKED 
THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT PUTT HE WOULD SETTLE FOR TWO PUTTS NOW I THINK HE IS IN A BIT OF TROUBLE ON THIRTEEN SANDY LYLE HE IS STRUGGLING TO STAY AT THREE PUTTING IS SO IMPORTANT HERE AT 
AUGUSTA IT IS IN MOST PROFESSIONAL 
EVENTS BUT PARTICULARLY HERE WHEN 
THE GREENS ARE SO FAST AND THERE IS 
SO MUCH SLOPE 
THERE IS NOTHING QUITE LIKE AMEN 
CORNER THE AND THE SPHERE HOW 
WOULD LOOKS THE ELEVENTH TWELFTH AND 
THIRTEENTH THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT 
THE ATMOSPHERE HOW IT LOOKS BUT 
THE GREENS HERE ARE DOUBLY 
DIFFICULT YOU HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE DO I 
SOFTLY ROLL IT IN THE FRONT EDGE OR 
DO I BASH IT IN KNOWING THAT IF I 
MISS COME I WILL GO FIVE F. T. BY IF I 
MISS I WILL GO FIVE FEET PAST YOU 
HAVE TO COMMIT TO A DECISION I WILL TRY AND THIS ONE IN FIRMLY TO DO THAT YOU NEED NERVES OF 
STEEL AND IF YOU MISS YOU WILL GO 
EIGHT FEET PAST THESE LITTLE FOUR 
FOOT SHOTS TESTER ON NERVES TO THE 
VERY SENIOR PARTICULARLY ON SUNDAY 
AND THE FINAL DAY TEST YOUR 
NERVES YOU CAN SEE WHAT FACES TIGER THERE IS A TREE IT JUST TIPPED OVER TO THE FRONT 
EDGE HE KEPT IT ABOUT FIVE FEET 
HIGH NO MORE SHOULD BE A SAFE 
CHIP AND A PUTT 
THAT WAS EXCELLENT 
I DO NOT THINK WE REALISED THE 
SEVERITY OF THAT SHOT HE HAS DID OR PUSHED IT HOICKED IT ALL THE HOLES HAVE 
A NAME WHICH IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE FEATURE THEY ALL 
HAVE NAMES OF EXOTIC BUSHES AND 
SHRUBS THIS IS SEVERELY UP HILL 
AND FROM HERE YOU REALLY DO NOT 
SEE ANYTHING THE FLAG IS TUCKED 
AWAY ROUND THE CORNER TO THE LEFT 
A LOT OF PLAYERS AND UP YARDS 
SHORT OF THE GREEN IT SWINGS FROM 
LEFT TO RIGHT THERE WAS ISSUED 
HUMP ON THE LEFT YOU CANNOT SEE IT 
HERE TO THEIR RHYS H. HUGE HUMP YOU CAN COME BOUNCING OFF THOSE NOUNS MOUNDS SANDY LYLE MUST HAVE HOLD THAT PUTT WELL PLAYED SUNDAY SANDY THIS WAS EARLIER TODAY THIS SECOND 
SHOT TO THE PAR FOUR THIRD WAS 
WONDERFULLY PLAYED HE WENT TO TWO 
UNDER AT THAT STAGE IT DID NOT 
CONTINUE IN THAT VAIN THERE IS A 
WHOLE HOST OF BOGEYS IN THERE AS 
WELL BUT A COUPLE OF LATE BIRDIES 
AS WELL A REASONABLE START 
YOU MASTERS DEBUT BIT OF A ROLLER 
COASTER TWO UNDER AFTER FOUR AND 
THEN THREE MACRO BIT LATER HOW 
WOULD YOU SUM IT UP 
IT IS NOT A 
BAD SCORE A BIT DISAPPOINTING L. 
DID NOT PLAY GREAT L. DID NOT HAVE 
MUCH CONTROL OFF THE GOLF BALL OVER 
THE TEE MY SHORT GAME WAS GOOD 
WERE PUTTING A SOLID CHIPPING WAS 
GOOD I CANNOT BE TOO DISAPPOINTED 
I DID GET UNDER A EARLY AND LED 
THE MASTERS L. DID NOTICE THAT 
THAT IS ONE TICKED OFF ANYWAY IT 
WAS GREAT I REALLY ENJOYED IT ONE 
THING I WANTED TO DO WAS MAKE SURE 
I CAME HERE REDBUD AND A DECENT 
PERFORMANCE IT IS AN UNKNOWN 
QUANTITY FOR ME THIS WEEK L. AM 
PLEASED I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT 
BOGEYING THE LAST UP FROM THE 
MIDDLE OF THE FAIRWAY BUT THAT WAS 
THE NATURE OF THE DAY IT DID NOT 
MEAN I WAS GOING TO HIT IT YOU YOU WERE TRYING SO HARD NOT TO LET THE 
WOW FACTOR OF THIS PLACE AFFECT YOU 
DID IT AFFECT YOUR SUPPORTERS CLAM 
HOW MANY HAVE YOU GOT HERE THERE THERE IS TWELVE IN MY ACTUAL GROUP OF PEOPLE 
BUT THEY HAD A GOOD TIME AND I DID 
NOT THINK THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING 
TO BE AS BUSY THERE WERE SO MANY 
PEOPLE OUT HERE IT IS GREAT 
ATMOSPHERE I HOPE THEY ARE SOAKING 
IT UP AND ENJOYING IT AS WELL 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE COME THEY WORK 
AS MUCH AS I HAVE NOT ONE OF HIS BEST ONES HE HAS PLAYED TWO OR THREE POOR 
CHIPS TODAY BY HIS STANDARD SAM 
THE YOUNGEST MASTERS CHAMPION FOR 
CHAP THE YOUNGEST MASTERS 
CHAMPION WILL HE GET OVER STEADY NOW THERE 
IS WATER AT THE BACK NOBODY IN 
THEIR RIGHT MIND COULD FANCY THIS 
SHOT UPHILL THEN IT FLATTENS OUT 
FIVE OR SIX PACES OVER NOT EASY AT 
ALL THREE UNDER PAR O. K. BRIAN BATEMAN ON SIXTEEN HE HAS PULLED IT IT WAS A WEAK ONE 
THAT WAS NOT THE SPIKE MARK PAL 
IT WAS YOU TWO UNDER NOT HAPPY WITH THAT ONE SANDY LYLE ISN'T IT FANTASTIC FIFTY YEARS OF AGE A GOOD WEEK FOR THE EUROPEANS SO FAR ROMERO WAS A RISING STAR NOW TIGER HE HAD A FAIRLY BAD RUN 
THREE HOLES AGO AND HE PITCHED IN 
AT THE FIFTEENTH FOR AND EVEN THREE 
THIS IS FOR A PAR AT THE SEVENTEENTH BUT A FOUR EVEN PAR SEVENTY TWO HE WILL BE OBVIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED 
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REST OF 
THE SCORES I DOUBT WHETHER ANYBODY 
WILL GET BETTER THAN SIXTY EIGHT SO IF HE 
GETS FOUR ON THE EIGHTEENTH HE WILL BE 
NO MORE THAN FOUR SHOTS BEHIND 
HELLO HELLO STEVE STRICKER IS IN 
TROUBLE ON THE EIGHTH OH MY GOODNESS WELL HE HAS GOT OUT OF TROUBLE JUST HE TRIED TO LAY UP OVER THE GREEN 
AND PAID VERY GOOD PITCH BACK AND PLAYED A VERY GOOD PITCH BACK 
ALMOST AS GOOD AS HE COULD DO 
UNLESS YOU HAVE AN ENORMOUS STROKE 
OF GOOD FORTUNE A GOOD SWING FROM SANDY AND A GREAT SHOT OVER THE TOP OF THE PIN HE WAS ANXIOUS NOTHING MUCH HAS HAPPENED FOR HIM 
TODAY APART FROM THE CHIPPING FROM 
BEHIND THE FIFTEENTH HE HAS BATTLED 
AWAY AND HE HAS STILL NOT MADE ANY 
GREAT MISTAKES LAST YEAR HE HIT 
THE TREES ON THE RIGHT HE HAS ONE OF THE BEST SWINGS ON THE TOUR A GREAT SHOT LONG IRON 
TOWERING DOWN THERE 
SWINGING QUITE 
BEAUTIFULLY LOOK AT THAT WISTERIA 
OR IT'S LOVELY COLOURS ON A DAY 
LIKE THIS THIS IS A MAGIC MAGIC 
PLACE WELL OF COURSE IF YOU'RE A MEMBER 
HERE ONE OF YOUR DISTINCTIVE 
FEATURES IS A GREEN JACKET ALL THE 
MEMBERS HAVE THEM LOOKS MORE 
LET'S LET'S LEARN MORE ABOUT THE 
OLD GREEN JACKET JUST ABOUT THE 
MOST FAMOUS ITEM OF CLOTHING IN 
SPORT THE AUGUSTA MEMBERS NATIONAL 
GREEN COAT AS IT WAS MET AS IT 
WAS KNOWN FIRST APPEARED IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN 
IT IS SAID THE MEMBERS WERE URGED 
TO BUY AND WEAR A JACKET DURING THE 
MASTERS SO SPECTATORS WOULD BE ABLE 
TO FIND SOMEBODY TO GET INFORMATION 
FROM IT WAS NOT UNTIL NINETEEN FORTY NINE BUT A 
GREEN JACKET WAS FIRST AWARDED TO A 
MASTERS CHAMPION AND THAT YEAR SAM 
SNEAD TRADITIONALLY THE CHAMPION 
TAKES HIS JACKET HOME WITH HIM FOR 
ONE YEAR BRINGING IT TO THE CLUB 
WHEN HE RETURNS FOR THE TOURNAMENT 
THE JACKET IS STORED AND IS 
AVAILABLE WHENEVER THE CHAMPION 
DOES IT IT IS THE CUSTOM AT THE 
MASTERS THAT THE WINNER FROM THE 
PREVIOUS YEAR PRESENTS THE GREEN 
JACKET TO THE NEW WINNER AND HELPS 
HIM INTO IT THREE PLAYERS HAVE 
MADE THAT IMPOSSIBLE IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX JACK 
NICKLAUS BECAME THE FIRST CHAMPION 
TO WIN CONSECUTIVE TOURNAMENTS AND 
HE DRESSED HIMSELF IN NINETEEN NINETY NICK 
FALDO ALSO ONE BACK TO BACK SO 
CHAIRMAN AT THE TIME HELPED HIM 
IN AND FROM AND TIGER DID THE 
SAME IN TWO THOUSAND TWO CHAIRMAN HOOTIE 
JOHNSON WAS ON HAND IT IS TWENTY YEARS SINCE SANDY LYLE'S VICTORY 
YOU PLAYED WITH SANDY LYLE AND THE 
PAR THREE CONTEST 
I PLAYED WITH 
HIM LAST WEEK IN THE DIP DOMINICAN 
REPUBLIC IN THE PRACTICE ROUND AND 
HE WAS EXCITED HE SHOWED ME WHAT 
HE WAS DOING AND TOOK FORTY BUCKS 
OFFERS HE WAS PLAYING NICELY SOME SOME OF HIS REACTIONS WHEN HE HOLED THE 
PUTTS ARE BETTER THAN WHEN HE HAD 
BETTER THAN THAT HE WON THE THING 
HE TRIES REALLY HARD HE HAS WORKED 
AT HIS GAME AND HE HAS NOT HAD AL 
LOT OF SUCCESS IN RECENT TIMES SO 
IT IS GOOD TO SEE HIM PLAYING WELL 
I'LL NEVER FORGET HIM WINNING THE 
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT MASTERS IT WAS A LEGENDARY 
SUCH SHOT HE GETS ASKED ABOUT IT 
EVERY WEEK OF THE YEAR SO IT IS 
FANTASTIC TO SEE HIM PLAYING WELL 
TIGER WOODS WE HAVE SEEN SOME 
TERRIFIC SHOTS FROM HIM AS ALWAYS 
TODAY WE SAW THE ONE UP THE SEVENTH 
WHAT A RATHER ONE AT SEVENTEEN THAT WE 
SAW HE LOOKED IN TROUBLE THIS IS DANGEROUS HE GOT IT 
THROUGH GAP 
WHAT IS THE SECRET 
TO HITTING A BALL THAT LOW SUCH A 
LONG SHOT HOW WOULD YOU HIT THAT 
SHOT SOLO AND KEEP IT UNDER 
CONTROL 
HE PLEADED OF THE BACK CONTROL FOOT HIT IT VERY SOFTLY AND HE 
KEPT IT LOW AND CHASING FORWARD 
THAT IS CLASSIC TIGER WOODS A LOT 
OF PLAYERS WOULD HAVE DROPPED A 
STROKE BUT HE GETS DOWN INTO NOT AN 
EASY UP AND DOWN 
HE HAS HAD THREE GOOD SHOTS AFTER A 
POOR TEE SHOT 
LET'S GET BACK OUT 
THERE A WEE BIT FIRM HE WILL NOT ENJOY THAT ONE TWO UNDER PAR GOING WELL THAT WAS TO TIE FOR THE LEAD JUST A WEE BIT FIRM ON THAT LINE NO SPIN AT THE WRONG TIME CAUGHT THE LITTLE SLOPE HE HAS MADE IT STRICKER IS BACK TO 
LEVEL PAR AN UGLY SEVEN AT THE EIGHTH 
SEVENS ON PAR FIVES THEY REALLY DO 
HEARD HEARD IT IS ALL DOWN HILL SLIDING AWAY FROM HIM JOHNSON WAGNER WAS THE WINNER LAST 
WEEK HE HAS GOT IT BUT IS A LEVEL 
PAR HE IS HAVING A GREAT COUPLE OF 
WEEKS HE WON LAST WEEK TO GET IN HERE AND HE IS MAKING THE MOST OF IT SECOND MASTER MARK SECOND MASTERS 
FINISHED FORTY FOURTH LAST YEAR HE BECAME 
ROOKIE OF THE YEAR A GREAT START 
TO HIS CAREER THIS IS WHERE WE SAW IT TIGER HE MADE SIX IT LOOKED QUITE GOOD GOING DOWN THERE IT IS EIGHT FEET PAST LOOKS AS SOLID AS A ROCK ONE HOLE LEFT SEVENTY THREE FOR 
THE OPEN CHAMPION NOT GREAT HE DID DOUBLE BOGEY AT THE FIFTH SO SEVENTY THREE IS NOT OUR COVERAGE NOT OUT OF IT ON SATURDAY WE HEAR THAT THE 
WEATHER SHOULD PLAY A BIG PART IN 
THE OUTCOME THERE WAS BONUS 
COVERAGE TODAY BECAUSE WE HAD EARLY 
MORNING FOG WHICH WAS VERY THICK 
WHEN THE OPENING CEREMONY TOOK 
PLACE YOU COULD NOT SEE VERY FAR 
AND THERE WAS ABOUT AN HOUR'S TO 
LAY DELAYED IT COULD GO ON UNTIL ONE A M. YOUR TIME IN THE UNITED KINGDOM OH DEAR 
HE HAS STRUGGLED TODAY HE PLAYED BEAUTIFULLY IN THE FIRST 
NINE OR TEN HOLES BUT HE DID NOT 
WHOLLY THING COOL WAY THING 
EVEN THE RUBBISH SHOTS DID NOT DO 
TOO BADLY TIGER'S SHOTS IF THEY SOMEHOW 
NEARLY ALWAYS FIND THE EDGE OF THE 
GREEN ALMOST STRAIGHT IN IT SEEMS THE 
ONE THAT GO STRAIGHT AT IT CANNOT 
STOP IT AND THE ONES THAT GO TO THE 
RIGHT JUST KILLS THE BALL HE STAYS AT THREE UNDER PAR ONE 
SHOT BEHIND JUSTIN ROSE HE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED IT MUST HAVE LOOKED A 
GREAT SECOND SHOT 
HE JUST WENT TOO 
FAR AS TIGER HAS DONE HE PLAYED A 
MAGNIFICENT SHOT BUT IT DID NOT 
STOP AND ENDED UP IN THE GULLY AT 
THE BACK HE IS STRIDING UP ON TO 
THE EIGHTEENTH FOR THE END OF HIS FIRST 
ROUND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE YARDS NOW THE EIGHTEENTH NEARLY 
SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YARDS IN LENGTH THE SOFT 
CONDITIONS THIS BECOMES A MONSTER 
COURSE SINCE THE BRITISH OPEN LAST YEAR HE 
HAS ONLY BEEN OUTSIDE THE TOP TWO 
WANTS THAT WAS FIFTH IT WAS A GOOD FOOT PAST THE HOLE THAT IS A BEAUTY THAT IS DELICIOUS 
FORGET THIS FELLOW MIGHT HAVE WON 
THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP AT CARNOUSTIE 
APART FROM THE LAST TWO HOLES WHEN 
IT WILL FADED AWAY FROM HIM IT 
ALL FADED AWAY HE SPLITS THE FAIRWAY HE LOOKS GOOD CALM IN CONTROL THIS IS HIS FIRST MASTERS JUSTIN WEE BIT TENTATIVE JUST A LITTLE BIT TENTATIVE FOUR RIGHT HANDED PLAYERS COME OR 
BECOME A SWINGING LEFT TO RIGHT 
CUTS ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT FOR 
RIGHT HANDED PLAYERS BIG SWINGING 
LEFT TO RIGHT PUTTS AT THE MOST 
DIFFICULT HE IS HAVING A GOOD LOOK AT THIS 
ONE THIS IS FOR A BIRDIE FAIRLY 
FLAT PUTT HE IS TWELVE TO FOURTEEN PACES FROM THE HOLE THIS IS A MEDIUM FAST DEAD ON LINE SEVENTY TWO FOR TIGER THAT MIGHT WELL BE HIS BAD ROUND 
OUT OF THE WAVE OUT OF THE WAY 
HE NEVER REALLY GOT IT GOING TODAY 
STRAIGHT PARS FOR THE FIRST NINE 
HOLES THEN HE CUT ON THE THIRTEENTH AND 
FOURTEENTH HICCOUGHS STRAIGHT IN SIR TREVOR IMMELMAN 
JOINS JUSTIN ROSE AT THE TOP OF THE 
LEADER BOARD FOUR UNDER PAR WITH 
THREE TO PLAY IT CERTAINLY GOT TO THE HOLE JUST TO HIDE TOO HIGH THERE IS WATER THERE THE WATER IN 
FRONT OF THE SIXTEENTH TEE IS DOWN THERE 
THAT HAS ENDED UP THIRTY YARDS TOO FAR ISSUED SHOT A HUGE SHOT IF HE IS NOT IN THE WATER HE SHOULD BE O. K. IT DID NOT CARRY THAT WAS THE SAME 
LINE AS TIGER'S JUSTIN HAS CAUGHT 
THE BUNKER NOT VERY DIFFICULT BUNKER SHOT HIS BEST ROUND HAS BEEN HIS OPENING ROUND THEY ARE NOT SCAMPERING AWAY DOWN THE HILLS 
THE GROUNDS ARE VERY 
SOFT BACK TO THE SIXTEENTH SHOULD BE TREVOR 
IMMELMAN ON THE TEE TIED FOR THE 
LEAD HE LIKES TO DRAW THE BALL SO 
I AM SURE HE WILL GO OFF THE BANK 
ON THE RIGHT HE IS VERY NICE 
LOOKING PLAYER NOT BIG MAN BUT A 
WONDERFUL PHYSIQUE GOOD RHYTHM 
SIMPLE SWING HE JUST HAS TO PLAY 
HIS GAME KEEP THE NERVES UNDER 
CONTROL AND HOLED FEW PUTTS HE JUST LOOKS THE FULL ARTICLE TO ME HE OCCASIONALLY GETS A LITTLE BIT QUICK THAT IS A FANTASTIC SHOT FROM 
IMMELMAN TO GO FIVE UNDER GREAT 
SHOT 
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS LAST ON SHOT THE TEE WITH A BIRDIE AT FIFTEEN WE WILL BE TALKING TO TIGER WOODS 
AFTER THE FIRST OF THE SIXTEEN MOST 
IMPORTANT ROUND OF THE YEAR CAN 
YOU GIVE ME YOUR ASSESSMENT 
NOTHING WENT MY WAY TODAY 
THOUGHT I PLAYED LOT BETTER THAN 
MY SCORE INDICATES L. HIT THE PUTTS 
REALLY WELL BUT NOTHING WENT NO NO BIRDIES HERE WHAT ABOUT THE SECOND 
SHOT AT THIRTEEN 
THAT WAS A SWEET SHOT 
A NICE SWEEPING FOREHAND THAT WAS 
A PERFECT SHOT BUT I ENDED UP WITH 
THE WORST SHOT L. THOUGHT ABOUT 
JUST PUTTING IT TO THE LEFT AND 
HAVING A THIRTY FOUR UP THE HILL L. WILL GO 
AHEAD DO TRY AND PLAY THIS PITCH 
AND TRY AND COME OFF AND MAKE IT 
SIX 
IN THE THIRD FIFTY 
THAT WAS SIX LITTLE EASY UPHILL SHARED BUT I 
HAVE TO MAKE SURE I'D CARRY IT FAR 
ENOUGH UPHILL CHIP 
THIS HAS 
TRADITIONALLY BE THE HARDEST DAY 
FOR SCORING FOR YOU AT THE AUGUSTA 
NATIONAL IS A DAY CASE OF SEEING 
WHAT THE COURSE WILL GIVE YOU THE THE WAY THE GOLF COURSE PLAYS ARE YOU 
DO NOT REALLY SHOOT LOW ROUNDS HERE 
ANY MORE YOU HAVE TO PLOD ALONG 
THIS IS PLAYING MORE OF A U. S. OPEN 
THAN IT IS A MASTERS THERE WAS 
ONLY ONE CHEAH ALL DAY AT IAN 
POULTER'S EAGLE AND APART FROM THAT 
IT WAS REALLY QUIET ONE ROAR OF 
APPLAUSE 
IT IS INTERESTING HOW THE APPLAUSE TECHNIQUE OF INTERVIEWING CHANGES 
EVERY YEAR OVER THE YEARS COME 
AND HAS THE ANSWERS OF EXPERIENCE 
GIVE A RATHER TIRED APPEARANCE A 
VERY HERE AND THE ANSWERS OF 
EXPERIENCE GIVE A RATHER TIRED 
APPEARANCE EVERY YEAR 
WE WILL HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF 
TIGER'S ROUND HE REALLY DID PLAY 
WELL THIS MORNING HE JUST SMACK IN THE RIGHT EDGE SNUCK 
I DISAGREE WITH YOU AND SNUCK TIGER HE WAS IN TROUBLE AT THE SEVENTH 
THIS WAS HIS THIRD SHOT HE MAY 
HAVE STRUCK A LOT OF GOOD SHOTS BUT 
HE ALSO HAD A FEW MINOR MIRACLES 
LIKE THE RESULT HERE IF YOU GAVE 
HIM MARKS AT OF TEN I THOUGHT HE 
WAS NO BETTER THAN SIXTY FIVE FROM WHERE 
I WAS SITTING MARKS OUT OF TEN 
THIS WAS A PITY THIS WAS A FOUR 
IRON THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL SHOT TO MAKE 
BOGEY FROM HERE BUT AS HE SAID HE 
JUST COULD NOT PLACE IT IN WORSE 
POSITION HE PUTTED IT IN THE WATER 
HERE LAST YEAR HE IS VERY ANGRY 
THERE 
IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL SHOT THERE THAT ONE GRABBED IN THE HILL THEN 
HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF WITH A 
LIGHTNING FAST PITCH DOWN WHICH 
WENT TEN OR TWELVE FEET PAST HE WAS IN TROUBLE HERE AND AT THE 
SEVENTEENTH WILL STOP WE LOOK AT THE WORLD 
THROUGH DIFFERENT GLASSES AND AT 
THE SEVENTEENTH THIS WAS EXQUISITE THIS CHIP HE SAID JUST AN EASY UPHILL CHIP 
ONLY HE COULD LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT 
I WOULD SAY THAT IS THE BEST APART 
FROM 
THE SECOND SHOT AT THE THIRTEENTH THERE WAS TOO MUCH SPEED I COULDN'T SEE THAT MISS NOW BACK TO THE LIVE ACTION AND ALL THE PATRONS WHEN NOBODY IS HERE 
JUST ACRES OF BEAUTIFUL GRASS THE 
PRACTICE PLAY WHERE THE MEMBERS CAN 
HIT BULLS IS OVERRUN THE LEFT 
HIT BALLS IS OVER ON THE LEFT SO IT IS A GREAT START FOR JUSTIN SUNDAY GOES BY DE TWO WONDER STILL 
IN GREAT SHAPE BUT DISAPPOINTING 
SANDY LYLE GOES TWO UNDER FOR A LOOK BACK DOWN 
THE EIGHTEEN AROUND SHORES SUNDAY LYLE BIRDIED THE LAST HOLE TO WIN THE MASTERS MADAME WRONG I AM SURE YES PACE IS 
SO IMPORTANT LINE AND SPEED GOOD SOLID 
PUTT WHAT A GREAT FIRST DAY HE IS HAVING THE A NICE SHOT SAFELY ON A FANTASTIC SHOT RUN RUN IT IS SO UNLUCKY A VERY VERY DIFFICULT PUTT HE ALMOST HAVE TO PUT THAT OFF THE GREEN ON THE RIGHT HOW DO THEY DO THAT IAN WOOSNAM ON THE CHAMPIONS TOUR 
AND ENJOYING IT IF YOU HAVE JUST 
JOINED US WE HAVE HAD SOME 
CRACKING SHOTS TODAY SOME 
WONDERFUL AND SOME WONDERFUL 
IMAGES HAVE A LOOK AT THIS A LOT OF LINING UP AND TO ING AND 
FRO ING THE HOLE IN ONE EXPERT 
KEN BROWN WHO IS AN EXPERT ON MOST 
THINGS PARTICULARLY PUTTING UP THE SLOPE GIVE IT A GOOD RAP 
AND WELL DONE A SUPER ROUND OF 
GOLF HIS FIRST MASTERS HE GOT 
HERE THROUGH WINNING LAST YEAR A GOOD START AND A BIT OF A FLURRY A LOVELY THREE TO FINISH IT JUST LANDS ON 
THE TOP SIDE OF THE FAIRWAY EIGHT YARDS FURTHER 
LEFT AND IT WOULD HAVE GOT A LOT 
MORE ROLL DOWN THERE ON THE FLAT A 
DIFFICULT SHOT FOR MICKELSON HAVE 
A LOOK AT THIS TENTH HOLE A 
BEAUTIFUL HOLE ELEVATION CHANGE OF 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED F. T. DOWN TO THE GREEN 
HARD RIGHT TO LEFT THE FIRST 
BUNKER YOU CAN SEE IS NOT REALLY IN 
PLAY IT IS OUT OF THE DRIVING 
DISTANCE LONDON IT THE LANDING 
AREA MICKELSON IS AT THE TOP OF 
THE SHADOWS YOU CAN SEE BY THE 
ARROWS THAT IS WHAT THE SLIPPERS 
FROM WHERE MICKELSON IS TODAY THE 
FLAG IS BACK RIGHT AND ONLY THREE 
OFF THE RIGHT SIDE SO HE HAS A 
DIFFICULT SHOT HE CAN MANOEUVRE 
THE BALL IN THERE LEFT TO RIGHT 
JUST A SPECTACULAR HOLD BUT ALWAYS 
NICE TO MAKE FOUR ON THIS TENTH 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PAR FOUR AS 
CLOSE BACK TO BACK YOU HAVE TO FLIRT WITH THE RIGHT 
HAND BUNKER AND FIND YOUR BALL IN 
THERE IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET INTO AMES HAS A BEAUTIFUL PLAYER PLAYED 
ONE OF THE FINEST ROUNDS A COUPLE 
OF YEARS AGO WHEN HE RUN THE 
PLAYERS' CHAMPIONSHIP IN THE FINAL 
ROUND HE WON VERY NICE TO WATCH IMMELMAN IS COMING BACK FROM SOME INJURIES LAST YEAR HE IS TWO OVER PAR PLAYED HIS 
FIRST TO CHAMPION EVENTS THE LAST 
TWO WEEKS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT 
BEING OUT THERE THE COURSE 
IS IN PERFECT CONDITION AT THE BACK OF THE SEVENTEENTH GREEN IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET DOWN INTO IF 
YOU GO OVER THE BACK PLAYERS 
USUALLY FAVOUR THE LEFT OF THE PIN 
A LITTLE BIT SHORT A MORMON IS OUT IN THIRTY FOUR THE BEST 
FRONT LINE THERE HAS BEEN A FEW OF 
THEM TODAY IN WOMAN IS ON THIRTY FOUR NOT MUCH WIND IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST CONDITIONS 
I HAVE EVER SEEN AT AUGUSTA FOR THE 
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS IT IS O. K. BUT VERY HIGH TARIFF FIRST SHOT THE LEFT HAND BUNKER IS IN PLAY IF YOU GET BIG ONE O. K. SNAGGING UP IN THE ROUGH I 
THINK THEY PUT THOSE BUNKERS IN 
AFTER WOOSNAM WINNING MANY YEARS 
AGO JUST WHIPPED IT OUT THERE JUSTIN ROSE HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF 
LEADING AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF THE 
MASTERS FOR THE THIRD TIME WHICH 
WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARY THERE IS TWO AND A HALF HOURS MORE 
COVERAGE COMING ON B. B. C. ONE WHICH 
IS A BONUS IT IS JUSTIN ROSE AND TREVOR 
IMMELMAN THAT CURRENTLY LEAD OF 
EIGHT 
WE ARE BACK ON B. B. C. ONE ABOUT AS 
MUCH TIME AS IT TAKES TO LINE UP A 
PUTT UNTIL THEN GOODBYE 
THE TARGETS CHANGE THE TERROR DOES NOT 
THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERRORISM
