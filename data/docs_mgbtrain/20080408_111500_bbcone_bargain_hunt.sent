IT'S GOT THIS DESIGN OF THISTLES IN VERY ORGANIC FORM 
AND THEN IT'S CONTINUED INTO THESE SWEEPING LEGS 
THEY'RE VERY ORGANIC AREN'T THEY I LIKE THE FLUIDITY OF THE DESIGN

THEY WENT ON THE BACK OF WASHSTANDS FIREPLACES 
INSIDE OF HALL ENTRANCES 
ANYWHERE YOU WANTED SERVANTS TO WIPE DOWN BUT STILL LOOK ATTRACTIVE 
SO THIS COULD HAVE BEEN PART OF A WASHSTAND OR COULD HAVE BEEN BOUGHT 
SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PUTTING IT IN THIS VERY NICE WALNUT FRAME 
AS A TEAPOT STAND IS THAT CONTEMPORARY WITH THE TILE 
I DO INDEED THIS IS QUALITY WOODWORKING I JUST LIKE THE PRINT 
IT'S VERY COOL UNDERSTATED SOPHISTICATED ISN'T IT 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT GOOD CHOICE I DON'T THINK I LIKE IT TOO MUCH WHY NOT I THOUGHT IT'S A BIT DRAB

WE'VE BASICALLY GOT A SILVER PLATED STAND HERE RIGHT

A NICE CIRCULAR DESIGN HERE AND THEN THIS NICE SORT OF GRAPE AS WELL WHICH IS VERY TYPICAL 
A FLOWING DESIGN KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
THIS IS VERY GERMANIC IT'S POSSIBLY WMF 
BUT I RATHER LIKE IT IT'S PLEASING 
GOOD QUALITY WILL IT CLEAN UP 
YES YOU CAN GIVE IT A POLISH BUT DON'T CLEAN IT TOO MUCH OR YOU MIGHT WEAR THE PLATE OFF 
TO KEEP THE AUTHENTICITY IT'S QUITE NICE TO HAVE THAT PATINA ON IT 
WHAT MIGHT IT GET AT AUCTION WELL IT'S A NICE PIECE 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT'S QUITE POPULAR NOW MAYBE ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BUT IT'S MARKED AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY 
OH SO YOU NEED TO DO A BIT OF BARTERING ON THERE 
SMILE AND WINK AT THE DEALERS AND GET THAT PRICE DOWN YEAH WE WILL GOOD LUCK 
I'LL DO MY BEST HAGGLING 
AND SMILING AND WINKING GOT IT FOR THE GIRLS FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
WE DON'T VERY OFTEN DO BOOKS ON BARGAIN HUNT 
BECAUSE BOOK DEALERS WON'T LUG THEIR HEAVY STOCK INTO A MUDDY FIELD 
WELL THIS GENTLEMAN HAS AND IT'S GOOD FUN TO SEE SOME OF HIS STOCK LET'S LOOK AT THIS EXAMPLE 
IT'S QUITE OBVIOUSLY FOR CHILDREN AND IT'S CALLED BUCCANO STORIES 
THIS IS THE STORY OF THE RIVER GATEWAY TO LONDON 
THE KIND OF FACTS AND FIGURES THAT BOYS AND GIRLS WERE INTERESTED IN IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND NINETEEN FORTIES 
ALL THE DETAILS LOOK ABOUT TOWER BRIDGE HOW THE HYDRAULIC RAMS WORKED 
TO MAKE THAT MIRACLE HAPPEN OF THE RISING AND FALLING OF TOWER BRIDGE 
AND IF THE CHILD GOT A BIT BORED THEN BY THIS MOMENT HE'D BE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE LOOK AT THIS 
TA D. A. 
IS THAT NOT THE MOST MARVELLOUS EXAMPLE OF A CUTAWAY BOOK 
THIS THING LITERALLY POPS UP AND THEY'RE CALLED POP UP BOOKS 
IF I DO IT ONE MORE TIME BECAUSE IT IS SUCH FUN I'LL CLOSE IT 
OPEN IT LIKE THAT AND LOOK THE DROP BRIDGE DROPS 
IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES SIMPLY DONE WITH CUT OUT PAPER 
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT DO YOU THINK THAT'S NICE 
NO WONDER SOME OF THESE BOOKS ARE ACTUALLY COLLECTORS' ITEMS 
THIS ONE IS PRICED AT ONLY TWENTY WHICH I THINK IS CHEAP DON'T YOU 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS GIRLS NO BUT MY HUSBAND WILL 
HE DOES QUITE A BIT OF WOODWORK IT'S A ROUTER ISN'T IT RIGHT 
WHAT DOES A ROUTER DO YOU KNOW FURNITURE WITH SLIDING DOORS 
A ROUTER MAKES THE GROOVES TO SLIDE THE FURNITURE ALONG 
OR FOR JOINTS RIGHT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS IS ITS CONSTRUCTION WOOD TURNING ON THESE NATURAL SCREWS SEE THAT 
IT'S TACTILE AND IT STILL WORKS IT'S NOT SEIZED UP 
THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL ON THAT YES IT'S GOT BRASS INLAY AS WELL 
AND STAMPED ALL THE WAY ROUND ARE THE PEOPLE WHO OWNED IT 
THERE'S SOMEBODY CALLED O. KINGSTON L. DRURY 
AND THEN HERE YOU'VE GOT THE MANUFACTURERS 
AND THIS LOOKS LIKE HIELDS H. I E. L. D. S. OF 
NOTTINGHAM AND WHERE ARE WE SELLING NOTTINGHAM 
WILL THAT ADD VALUE TO THE PRICE THERE WILL BE COLLECTORS WHO COLLECT NOTTINGHAM TOOLS 
NICE PIECES THERE'S A LOT THERE 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS PEG SECTION 
WHICH IS THEM HAMMERED IN TO SECURE IT 
ALL OF THEM CAME IN THIS CANVAS BAG STRAIGHT FROM THE CABINET MAKER 
HOW MUCH IS IT WELL IT'S SEVENTY FIVE SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO DO 
SHAVE A BIT OFF THE PRICE

I HAVEN'T GOT MY BOOK WITH ME BUT I'M GUESSING ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY 
QUITE A GOOD AGE AND WE'VE GOT THE MAKER'S MARK E. B. AND J. B. EDWARD AND JOHN BARNARD 
THEY'RE QUITE WELL KNOWN MAKERS QUITE PROLIFIC 
WHAT I'M NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT IS WHETHER IT'S A LITTLE TRAY FOR PUTTING BUSINESS CARDS ON 
OR IF IT'S A STAND FOR A PRESERVE BOTTLE BUT IT'S A NICE OBJECT AND YOU WANTED SOME SILVER 
I DID YEAH WHAT ATTRACTS YOU THE AGE THE HALLMARK 
AH CANNY AGE AND HALLMARK I LIKE IT 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT'LL FETCH I'D PROBABLY SAY IT'S WORTH EIGHTY OR SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT

WE NEED TO GET THAT DOWN A BIT IN ORDER TO MAKE A PROFIT 
FINGERS CROSSED GET IT AT THE RIGHT PRICE AND THAT'S OUR LAST ITEM 
I'LL LEAVE IT WITH YOU GOOD LUCK O. K. 
AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT AT SIXTY 
WHATEVER THE TEAMS DON'T SPEND IS CALLED LEFTOVER LOLLY 
AND IT WILL BE SPENT BY THEIR EXPERT ON A BONUS BUY 
AND THAT COULD TURN OUT TO BE THEIR TRUMP CARD AT THE AUCTION IN THE OLD BONUS STAKES 
OR THEY COULD TAKE A BACKWARD STEP WHATEVER TIME'S UP 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THEY BOUGHT 
THE REDS HOPE THEIR SIXTY FIVE CANTERBURY WILL RACK UP A GOOD PROFIT 
AND THE MINTON NAME SHOULD ADD A FEW QUID TO THE TENNER SPENT ON THE TILE 
FINALLY THEY HOPE THE NOTTINGHAM NAME WILL BOOST THE PROFIT ON THE ROUTER 
SO WHICH ITEM DO YOU LIKE MOST 
THE CANTERBURY MAGAZINE HOLDER 
AND PAULA I STILL LIKE THE MINTON TILE AND I RECKON IT WILL MAKE THE MOST PROFIT FOR US 
HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE 
O. K. ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN OF LEFTOVER LOLLY THANK YOU 
THERE'S ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN EXACTLY THANK YOU HAPPY WITH THAT YES 
YOUR WIFE IS GOING TO BE VERY CROSS WITH YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME WHEN SHE SEES YOUR SHOES 
SHE WON'T BE THERE TIM OH GOT ANYTHING IN MIND TO BUY YES 
LET'S SAY IT'S A SILVER LINING O. K. WELL THERE'S A HINT 
YOU'D BETTER GO OFF AND SECURE IT NOW WHAT DID THE BLUES BUY 
THEY HOPE THE SHELLEY TEA SERVICE IS A REAL STEAL AT EIGHTEEN 
HOWEVER THE ART NOUVEAU VASE FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE LESS OF A BARGAIN 
BUT THE SILVER TRAY WAS ALSO BOUGHT FOR A GOOD PRICE ONLY SIXTY QUID 
O. K. RAE AND YVONNE WHICH OF THAT LOT WILL MAKE A MINT 
THE SHELLEY SET DEFINITELY YEAH SPEAKING WITH ONE PAIR OF LIPS HERE 
YES YES HOW MUCH LEFTOVER LOLLY IS THERE 
ONE HUNDRED TWO O. K. YOU SPENT ONE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THAT GOES ACROSS TO MARK WELL DONE OLD FRUIT 
NOT BAD IS IT ANYTHING IN MIND SOMETHING SMALL DELICATE AND FEMININE REALLY 
WE'LL FIND OUT ABOUT IT AT AUCTION RIGHT NOW THOUGH SOME TIME OFF FROM THE PRESSURE OF PROFIT MAKING 
SOMETIMES WHEN I VISIT THESE STATELY HOMES I COME ACROSS AN OBJECT THAT IS SO RARE AND UNDERSTATED 
THAT IT FAIR TAKES MY BREATH AWAY 
HERE AT NEWSTEAD ABBEY I'VE COME ACROSS JUST SUCH A GEM 
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU GO UPSTAIRS IN THESE STATELY HOMES 
YOU COME INTO ROOMS WITH A DECIDEDLY GOTHIC FEEL INCREDIBLY DARK AND A BIT GLOOMY 
THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS ROOM ALL THIS DARK FURNITURE 
YOU MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO SCURRY THROUGH A SPACE LIKE THIS AND NOT HAVE A PROPER LOOK AROUND 
YOU'D BE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE BECAUSE IT CONTAINS A SUITE OF FURNITURE 
THAT IS OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE 
BUT WHICH PIECES ARE THEY WELL JUST CLOCK THIS LOT 
ON THE WALL WE'VE GOT AN EXTRAORDINARY WALL MIRROR 
MADE UP WITH A FRAME OF MIRRORS 
IT STANDS ABOVE A CENTRE TABLE FLANKED BY TWO TORCHERES 
AND THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE BEHIND ME IS ANOTHER MIRROR ENCRUSTED SIDE CABINET 
SO WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS 
THE FIRST THING THAT STRIKES YOU IS THAT IT IS ALL COMPLETELY COVERED IN PIECES OF MIRROR 
HERE WE'VE GOT A LARGE RECTANGULAR CENTRAL PLATE 
AND THE FRAME IS MADE UP OF THESE SMALLER PLATES CALLED MARGINAL PLATES 
THESE MIRROR PANELS FROM THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WERE PROBABLY MADE IN THE VAUXHALL PLATE WORKS 
THUS THIS SUITE IS KNOWN AS THE VAUXHALL SUITE 
IF YOU WANTED A MIRROR IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE 
IT TOOK WEEKS TO PRODUCE 
SHEETS OF GLASS WERE POLISHED SMOOTH WITH WOODEN ROLLERS AND THEN A LAYER OF MERCURY WAS POURED OVER 
SANDWICHED INTO PLACE WITH A SHEET OF TIN SOME WEEKS LATER YOU FINALLY HAD YOUR FINISHED MIRROR 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE REFLECTED IMAGE IT'S ALL KIND OF GREY AND SPOTTY 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE MERCURY AND TIN HAVE REACTED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BEHIND THE SHEET OF GLASS 
IN THE LAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS 
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT AN OLD MIRROR THAT IS GREYISH LIKE THIS DON'T HAVE IT RE SILVERED 
PART OF THE BEAUTY AND THE VALUE OF OLD MIRROR PLATES IS THE VERY FACT THAT THEY ARE GREY AND PITTED 
THIS MIRROR IS CONTAINED BY OTHER LITTLE MIRRORS 
EACH OF THE PIECES OF FURNITURE IN THE SUITE ARE PLASTERED WITH SIMILAR MIRRORED PANELS 
AROUND THE EDGES OF THE CENTRE TABLE AND THE TWO TORCHERES 
AND THAT IS WHY THIS IS A NATIONAL TREASURE 
A BIT LIKE ME REALLY OOPS 
FOR OUR AUCTION WE'VE COME TO MELLORS AND KIRK IN NOTTINGHAM 
AND THE BROWSERS ARE ALREADY BUSY HUNTING FOR BARGAINS OF THEIR OWN 
SO NIGEL KIRK HERE WE ARE AGAIN WELCOME GREAT TO BE IN NOTTINGHAM 
NOW INEZ AND PAULA WENT WITH THE ART NOUVEAU CANTERBURY AND LETTER RACK DO YOU LIKE THAT 
NO IT IS INDEED A CANTERBURY WHICH IS A STAND FOR SHEET MUSIC PRIMARILY 
AND I SUPPOSE YOU COULD GET AWAY WITH CALLING IT ART NOUVEAU BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE OF THESE TRESTLES 
I THINK IT COMES FROM THE CONTINENT QUITE POSSIBLY 
THINK IT MIGHT BE FRENCH OR SPANISH I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT SPANISH IT'S GOT LEATHERWORK 
BUT COULD EASILY BE ENGLISH I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT MUCH 
WHAT IS IT WORTH TWENTY OR THIRTY OH LORD SIXTY FIVE PAID 
SIXTY FIVE THAT'S A TALL ORDER 
WHAT ABOUT THE MINTON POTTERY TILE THIS I DO LIKE 
THERE WERE THREE MINTON FACTORIES IN THIS PERIOD 
THIS IS A PRODUCT OF THE MINTON CHINA WORKS 
THIRD QUARTER OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
AS WITH ALL MINTON PRODUCTS EXTREMELY GOOD QUALITY 
IT'S A WALL TILE WHICH HAS BEEN MOUNTED IN WALNUT AS A TEAPOT STAND 
THIRTY OR FORTY PERHAPS 
TEN PAID THAT'S REASONABLE 
IT'S A MIRACLE ISN'T IT IT MAY HAVE CLAWED BACK THE LOSS ON THE CANTERBURY IF THERE IS ONE 
AND WE FINISH WITH THE ROUTER YES 
HOW ARE YOU ON WOODWORKING TOOLS NOT BRILLIANT BUT VICTORIAN TOOLS 
ARE USUALLY BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND IT'S STAMPED BY THE MAKER ESTIMATE 
TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE BRILLIANT FIFTY EIGHT THEY PAID THAT LOOKS AS IF IT'S GOING TO BOMB 
IT DOES A BIT YES I'M FEELING REALLY ROUTED BY THAT 
WHAT ABOUT THEIR BONUS BUY

THERE'S A HANDSOME POT ABSOLUTELY NICE SHAPE 
VERY NICE ELEGANT PIECE OF GEORGE THE THIRD PERIOD ENGLISH SILVER 
BRIGHT CUT AND BY A DISTINGUISHED MAKER A LADY SILVERSMITH 
QUITE RIGHT SHOULD DO WELL THERE IS ONLY ONE FACTOR 
AND THAT IS THAT THERE IS A REPAIR JUST BENEATH THE HINGE 
AND THE BROKEN LINER THE LINER I DON'T THINK REALLY MAKES MUCH DIFFERENCE 
THEY CAN BE REPLACED EASILY SO ESTIMATE 
I THINK IT'LL MAKE ONE HUNDRED PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY HE PAID FIFTY 
I THINK THAT'S A BARGAIN A BARGAIN EVEN ALLOWING FOR THE DAMAGE 
GOOD OLD DAVID BARBY NOW FOR THE BLUES RAE AND YVONNE THE SHELLEY TEA SERVICE 
SHELLEY IS A GOOD FACTORY VERY SOUGHT AFTER AND COLLECTABLE 
IT USED NOT TO BE VERY SOUGHT AFTER AT ALL BUT IS THIS SORT OF PRIMROSE PATTERN DESIRABLE

BUT THE HIGHEST PRICES ARE PAID FOR THE NINETEEN THIRTIES ART DECO PIECES 
WHICH OFTEN ARE TRIANGULAR SHAPED 
THIS IS KNOWN IN THE SHELLEY RECORDS AS THE DAINTY SHAPE 
SIXTEEN PIECES THEN HOW MUCH FIFTY TO SEVENTY 
FANTASTIC EIGHTEEN THEY PAID THAT WAS A GOOD BUY 
WE MAY GET A PROFIT NOW A SILVER TRAY BY THE BARNARDS

BUT I THINK IT'S A PLATE FROM A CHRISTENING SET SWEET BORN WITH A SILVER PLATE IN YOUR MOUTH 
INDEED SO VERY GOOD HOW MUCH ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES PERIOD REASONABLE CONDITION 
I'D HAVE THOUGHT SIXTY TO NINETY SIXTY THEY PAID FAIR ENOUGH SUPER DUPER

YOU'RE ENCLOSING THE CELERY ON A WAISTED STEM AS WELL

A PIECE OF GERMAN PEWTER AND IT'S MADE BY WMF 
PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS MAKER
