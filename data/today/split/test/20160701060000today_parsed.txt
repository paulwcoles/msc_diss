# A STUDY HAS FOUND THAT THE HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER OVER THE ANTARCTIC HAS BEGUN TO SHRINK SCIENTISTS SAY IT'S NOW ONE AND A HALF MILLION SQUARE MILES SMALLER THAN IT WAS IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND BECAUSE OF A DECLINE IN THE USE OF CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS OR C.F.C.S MCGRATH HAS MORE DETAILS
A DRAMATIC THINNING OF THE OZONE LAYER WAS FIRST DETECTED IN THE STRATOSPHERE ABOVE ANTARCTICA IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SCIENTISTS WERE WORRIED AS THIS LAYER PROTECTS HUMANS ANIMALS AND PLANTS FROM THE DESTRUCTIVE IMPACT OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION THEY QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT C.F.C. CHEMICALS WIDELY USED IN REFRIGERATOR SPRAYS AND AIR CONDITIONING WITH A KEY INTERNATIONAL CONCERN SPARKED A GLOBAL AGREEMENT CALLED THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL WHICH BANNED THE USE OF C.F.C.S IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THE ELIMINATION OF THESE GASES CAUSED THE SLOWDOWN IN THE RATE OF INCREASE OF THE ANTARCTIC OZONE HOLE BUT THIS NEW PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THE FIRST FINGER PRINTS OF HEALING HAS BEGUN AND THE OZONE IS GROWING AGAIN
# M.P.S ARE URGING THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE RADICAL CHANGES TO THEIR LAWS ON PROSTITUTION IN ENGLAND AND WALES THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE SAYS SOLICITING SHOULD NO LONGER BE A CRIME FOR SEX WORKERS OF THOSE WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR OFFENCES RELATED TO PROSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS DELETED THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WOULD CONSIDER THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS

FORTY YEAR OLD JOSHUA BROWN WAS KILLED WHEN THE TEARS THE CAR HE WAS DRIVING COLLIDED WITH A LORRY COUNSELLOR SAID THE CAR FAILED TO SLOW DOWN AS IT DIDN'T SPOT THE WHITE TRAILER AGAINST THE BRIGHT SKY
U.S. REGULATORS ARE TO LOOK AT WHETHER THE AUTO PILOT FUNCTION COULD BE CONSIDERED AT FAULT THAT INVESTIGATION COULD LEAD TO A RECALL TEST OF THE SCRIBE THE DEATH AS A TRAGIC LOSS BUT THE COMPANY'S STRESS THAT DRIVERS USING AUTO PILOT HAD TRAVELLED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION SAFE MILES TO DATE

# THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE THE WEATHER FORECAST FROM PETER GIBBS WHO'S AT THE WEATHER'S GOOD MORNING PETER GOOD MORNING JOHN THIS TIME LAST YEAR WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF A HEAT WAVE TEMPERATURE UP TO THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES AT HEATHROW BUT TODAY AND OVER THE WEEKEND WILL BE HARD PUSHED ACTUALLY TO EVEN REACH TWENTY DEGREES
IN MOST AREAS AND THAT'S THE CASE TODAY LET'S START WITH A DETAIL ACROSS SOUTHWEST ENGLAND AND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND WHERE IT'S A BIT OF A CLOUDY DAMP START FAIRLY MILD MIND YOU IT'LL SLOWLY BRIGHTEN UP FROM THE WEST BUT WE COULD SEE SOME RAIN LINGERING ACROSS KENT AND SUSSEX UNTIL MID AFTERNOON ONE OR TWO EVENING SHOWERS BREAKING OUT ELSEWHERE
FOR WALES THE MIDLANDS AND EASTERN ENGLAND WELL SCATTERED SHOWERS ON AND OFF HERE THROUGH THE DAY ONE OR TWO HEAVY ONES CERTAINLY THIS AFTERNOON BUT ALSO SOME LENGTHY DRY SPELLS AND SOME DECENT SPELLS OF SUNSHINE BREAKING THROUGH AS WELL AS WE GO THROUGH THE MORNING
FOR ALL OF NORTHERN ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND IT'S BASICALLY A DAY OF SUNNY SPELLS AND SHOWERS JUST A BIT MORE PERSISTENT RAIN AT THE MOMENT ACROSS EASTERN SCOTLAND ESPECIALLY ABERDEENSHIRE BUT THAT SHOULD CLEAR AWAY OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS BUT ONCE THOSE SHOWERS GET GOING THEY ARE GOING TO BE HEAVY THERE'LL BE SOME THUNDER AND HAIL IN THE MIX AS WELL THAT PASSING THROUGH FAIRLY QUICKLY ON A BRISK WESTERLY WIND WITH SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE
IN BETWEEN BUT THAT BRISK WIND THE FEATURE OF THE WEATHER ACROSS ALL OF THE U.K. TODAY TEMPERATURES GENERALLY BELOW AVERAGE SO AROUND THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN ACROSS NORTH WESTERN AREAS TO AROUND NINETEEN OR TWENTY IN THE SOUTH EAST THE WEEKEND CONTINUING IN A SIMILAR VEIN QUITE A LOT OF DRY WEATHER WILL GET SOME SUNSHINE AT TIMES BUT ALWAYS THE THREAT OF A SHARP SHOWER IT'LL STAY BREEZY AND ON THE COOL SIDE CERTAINLY OUT OF THE SUNSHINE THAT'S THE ONE
# THANKS PETER SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE PAPERS WELL LET'S START WITH A FINANCIAL TIMES WILL GET ONTO THE GOSSIPY STUFF IN A MINUTE BUT MARK CARNEY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES BIG PICTURE OF HIM AND CARNE READY TO ACT AS U.K. SUFFERS ECONOMIC POST TRAUMATIC STRESS FIFTIES HEADLINE THE BANK OF ENGLAND PREPARING TO UNLEASH ANOTHER ROUND OF MONETARY STIMULUS AS IT BATTLES TO CONTAIN THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT OF THE U.K.'S DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U.
AND DESPITE MY CARNEY'S GLOOMY PROGNOSIS THE F.T. SUGGESTS AND ITS NEWS STORY THERE WAS A GENERAL SENSE OF RELIEF IN THE MARKET THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS PROMISING TANGIBLE ACTION THEY'VE TALKED TO ONE ASSET MANAGER BIG ASSET MANAGER WHO SAID MY CONNIE SEEMED TO BE SETTING OUT A CONSIDERED ROAD
INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY AND CREDIBILITY IN TIMES LIKE THIS ARE VITAL AND CARLY STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE AND IS ALSO A STORY IN THE INTERNATIONAL NEW YORK TIMES NOT SUCH A POSITIVE ONE IN A SENSE WHICH CITY IS GOING TO BE THE LONDON OF THE FUTURE HE'S THE HEADLINE THE RACE IS ON TO BE THE NEW LONDON UNLESS BRITAIN FINDS A WAY TO UNDO ITS DECISION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION LONDON'S DAYS THE PRE EMINENT GLOBAL FINANCIAL CAPITAL RANKED EVEN AHEAD OF NEW YORK
# MAYBE NUMBERED IT SETS AND THERE IS ANOTHER STORY IN THE NEWSPAPERS AS JUSTIN SUGGESTED AND IT'S MASSIVE ON ALL THE FRONT PAGES THE WORD MOST OFTEN USED I SUPPOSE IN ALL THE HEADLINES IS TREACHERY THE TELEGRAPHS AND ACT OF MIDNIGHT TRAGEDY TREACHERY AS BORIS PULLS OUT OF THE TORY LEADERSHIP RACE IT SAYS SUPPORTERS ACCUSED GUV ARE PLOTTING TO DESTROY HIS LEAVE ALLY IN HIS OWN POWER HAD MUCH THE SAME ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE GUARDIAN
THE BETRAYAL BORIS CANNOT PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE TASK AHEAD IN QUOTES ONE OF ITS WRITERS MARINE SIRS MARINA HYDE SAYS BYE BYE BORIS THE MAN WHO COULDN'T CLEAN UP HIS OWN MESS OPINIONS ARE DIVIDED AS TO WHO SHOULD
TAKE OVER FROM HIS IF HE DID HAVE A LEADING ROLE THEN WHO'S GOING TO TAKE OVER FROM HIM HE WAS GOING TO BE THE NEW FAVOURITE THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT EITHER IT IS WELL ALMOST NO DOUBT MOSTLY IT'S THERESA MADE A PARTY INFLAMES THE DAILY MAIL AND WHY IT MUST BE TERESA AND IN THE GUARDIAN MARTIN KETTLE GOOD RIDDANCE JOHNSON BRING ON THERESA MAY AND SO ON HOWEVER IN THE TIME AS ONE OF THEIR COLONISTS PHILIP
COLIN'S SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF MY GETTING THE TOP JOB THE JUSTICE SECRETARY HAS THE INTELLECTUAL ABILITY POLITICAL COURAGE AND DECISIVENESS TO BE A GREAT PRIME MINISTER HE SAYS AND THE HEADLINER WERE THERE HIS PIECE KNIFE WIELDING GUV OVER DESERVES THE TORY CROWN
# THE TIME TEN PAST SIX ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO TODAY A WAVE OF SUFFERING AND SADNESS WAS ABOUT TO BREAK BRITISH TROOPS AND TROOPS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL ABOUT TO LAUNCH THEIR ATTACK AT THE SOMME JIM IS AT THE SITE OF THE BATTLEFIELD FOR US THIS MORNING GEMMA MORNING
MORNING JUSTIN IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY SCENE HERE AND I'M SITTING AT THE FOOT OF THE VAL MEMORIAL THAT HUGE STONE SET OF ARCHES BY SIR EDWARD THAT DOMINATES THE LANDSCAPE AROUND HERE AND IS THE MEMORIAL TO THE MISSING OF THE SOMME ABOUT SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND BRITISH AND SOUTH AFRICAN SOLDIERS WHOSE REMAINS WERE NEVER FOUND NEVER BURIED PROPERLY AND IT DOMINATES THE LANDSCAPE AND WE ARE HERE I SUPPOSE QUITE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE
BRITISH LINE AS IT WAS ON THE FIRST OF JULY NINETEEN SIXTEEN ABOUT FOURTEEN MILES LONG WITHOUT ADVANCE STARTED AT HALF PAST SEVEN AND THERE'LL BE A TWO MINUTE SILENCE AS WE HAD TO MARK THAT MOMENT AND THE ARMY THEN LOST WELL FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND CASUALTIES IN THE FIRST DAY NINETEEN THOUSAND DEAD THE REST
WOUNDED SOME OF THEM DREADFULLY WOUNDED AND IT WAS THE WORST DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE BRITISH ARMY IN TERMS OF LOSSES AND THE FOCUS OF WHAT WE ARE COMMEMORATING TODAY WE'LL MOVE LATER ON IN THE MORNING WON'T IT TO WESTMINSTER
THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN THERE'LL BE A HUGE ACT OF REMEMBRANCE HERE AS WELL AS IN LONDON THE PRINCE OF WALES IS HERE WITH PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY WILL BE READINGS BY THE PRIME MINISTER BY THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER MANUAL VALSE AS A FORMER PRESIDENT OF GERMANY COMING
TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL BE GATHERED ROUND THE MEMORIAL IT WILL BE A HUGE AND ALMOST CERTAINLY VERY MOVING OCCASION YOU CAN FOLLOW ALL THE EVENTS OF COURSE ON B.B.C. RADIO AND TELEVISION THROUGHOUT THE DAY THAT WILL BE HAPPENING HERE WHERE I AM AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING AND IT IS REALLY A MOMENT JUSTIN THAT'S BEING SEEN AS THE
PRINCIPAL COMMEMORATION IN EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING TO MARK THE CARNAGE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN NINETEEN FOURTEEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTEEN BECAUSE THAT FIRST DAY OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME IS SEEN AS ONE THAT ENCAPSULATES THE HORROR THAT THE DISASTER THE
SHEER HUMAN SUFFERING WHICH CHARACTERISES IN EVERYONE'S MIND THAT CONFLICT
AND EVERYWHERE YOU GO HERE THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CEMETERIES IN THIS PART OF FRANCE MANAGED BY THE COMMONWEALTH WAR GRAVES COMMISSION AND THE ISLE OF COURSE EXTRAORDINARILY MOVING PLACES BIG ONES AND SMALL ONES I'LL BE REPORTING LATER FROM A COUPLE OF THEM AND THE NUMBER OF VISITORS WHO COME HERE TO SEARCH FOR A RELATIVE SOMEBODY THE BUT HAPS HAD HEARD OF SOMEBODY FROM THE LOCALITY FROM ONE OF THE PALS BATTALIONS WHO WERE RECRUITED IN STREETS AND IN WHAT PLACES
YOU CAN SEE THEM AT ANY TIME OF THE DAY OR NIGHT IN THE CEMETERIES LOOKING FOR NAMES AND THIS WHOLE AREA OF FRANCE WHICH LOOKS SO PEACEFUL THIS MORNING THE SUN HAS JUST COME UP THERE'S A CUCKOO IN THE TREE JUST ALONGSIDE US SOME WONDERFUL BIRDSONG BEHIND US AND IT LOOKS IDYLLIC
CORN AND BARLEY IN THE SUN BUT YOU LOOK AT THIS MEMORIAL IN THE GRAVES BEYOND THAT YOU REALISE WHAT IT COMMEMORATES AND WHAT IT WILL ALWAYS MEAN AS LONG AS THIS ARCH STANDS IS SOMETHING THAT
# TAKES US TO THE BEGINNING OF A WHOLE BLOODY CHAPTER IN EUROPEAN HISTORY AND THAT'S WHAT WILL BE HIM COMMEMORATED HERE AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK BRITISH TIME INDIA PILE AND WE'LL BE HEARING FROM YOU AS YOU SUGGEST THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME GENT THANKS IT'S FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX NOW M.P.S WANT THE LAWS ON PROSTITUTION CHANGED SO THAT IT'S NO LONGER A CRIME FOR WOMEN TO SOLICIT ON THE STREETS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SHOULD ASSUME THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS ONLY THEY TALK ABOUT DECRIMINALISING
YES THAT'S RIGHT THIS IS THE RADICAL SUGGESTION FROM THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE THEY ADMIT THAT IT PROSTITUTION IS A POLARISING SUBJECT AND THEY COULD HAVE SAT ON THE FENCE BUT THEY'VE COME DOWN FIRMLY ON THE SIDE OF DECRIMINALISING SOLICITING SAYING THAT AT THE MOMENT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT IT REDUCES DEMAND FOR PROSTITUTION AND IT HAS AN ADVERSE EFFECT BECAUSE IT PREVENTS SEX WORKERS FROM SEEKING HELP
GET OUT OF PROSTITUTION AND EXPOSES THEM TO ABUSE AND VIOLENCE AS WELL AS THAT IDEA OF DECRIMINALISING SOLICITING THEY ALSO WANT TO SEE SEX WORKERS WHO HAVE CONVICTIONS OR CAUTIONS FOR OFFENCES RELATED TO PROSTITUTION TO HAVE THOSE THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD OR WIPED BECAUSE IT WOULD HELP
THEM SEEK OTHER WORK TO EXIT PROSTITUTION AND THE OTHER SUGGESTION IS THAT BROTHEL KEEPING SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED IN THE SENSE THAT AT THE MOMENT IS ILLEGAL FOR TWO OR MORE PEOPLE TO WORK SEX WORKERS TO WORK IN A BROTHEL THEY WANT THAT LAW TO BE AMENDED BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT WOULD BE SAFER FOR THEM TO DO SO SO IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY HAD THEIR WAY OF THE M.P.S HAVE THEIR WAY WE WOULD SEE
THE WOMEN IN THE STREET WE WAS WHO PROSTITUTE IN THE STREETS WHO WOULD BE WHAT IGNORED BY THE POLICE BROTHELS WHO WOULD SIMILARLY BE IGNORED BY THE POLICE IN TERMS OF THE BROTHELS I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT IT WOULD ENCOURAGE SEX WORKERS TO WORK INDOORS WHICH IS PURE RIGHT REGARDLESS SAFER THAN BEING ON THE STREET
IN TERMS OF BEING ON THE STREET THAT THE LAW AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE SAYING DETERS SEX WORKERS FROM SEEKING HELP FOR THEIR PROBLEM FOR NO PERHAPS ACCESSING HEALTH SERVICES AND SO ON AND ALSO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE POLICE WHO ARE LIKELY TO ARREST THEM THEN THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO SORT OF WORK IN THE SHADOWS AND SO ON SO IT IS A SEA CHANGE IS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE THAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING
THERE'S NO DUCKING THAT BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS THE BOOK PEOPLE WOULDN'T MIND WOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY TO SEE PROSTITUTES WANDERING THE STREETS ROBBING CARS AND ALL THE REST OF IT WELL I DON'T THINK THAT IS LIGHTLY THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN OBJECT TO THAT AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM AS WELL AS THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HE SAY THAT THE SEX INDUSTRY IS AN EXPLOITATIVE INDUSTRY AND PEOPLE GET ABUSED WHAT THE COMMITTEE IS SAYING
IS THAT OF COURSE THEY SHOULD STILL BE TOUGH ACTION TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEING EXPLOITED BY THIS IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AREA AND I THINK THE CAVIAR TO THIS JOHN IS TO SAY THAT I DON'T THINK THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE ACTED ON BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS IN FLUX AND THE NEW HOME SECRETARY WHOEVER THAT MAY BE IN THE COMING MONTHS IS IS LIKELY TO HAVE OTHER PROBABLY NOT ON THE TOP OF THE AGENDA AROUND IN ON DANNY THANKS VERY MUCH
# SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX CARNE READY TO ACT IS THE HEADLINE WE HAVE TEA THIS MORNING THAT SEEMS TO SUGGEST A HINT ABOUT A BIG HINT THAT INTEREST RATES COULD BE CUT BEFORE THE END OF THE DETAILS ON THAT THE REST OF US AS WELL AS DOMINIC MONTGOMERY THANK YOU MOST CENTRAL BANKERS NORMALLY PRIDE THEMSELVES AND SPEAKING IN VERY GENERAL DIPLOMATIC TERMS ALMOST IN CODE AND THEN LEAVING THE MARKETS TO GUESS WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN
THAT WASN'T THE CASE YESTERDAY MARK CARNEY WAS PRETTY BLUNT SAYING THE ECONOMY WOULD SUFFER A POST BRICKS AT SHOCK AND GIVING HER VERY STRONG STEEL AT THE NEXT MOVE AND INTEREST RATES WOULD BE DOWN IN MY VIEW
AND I'M NOT PREJUDGING THE VIEWS OF OTHER INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE M. P. C. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK HAS DETERIORATED AND SOME HONOUR TERRY POLICY EASING WILL LIKELY WOULD BE REQUIRED
OVER THE SUMMER CITY ECONOMISTS NOW THINK INTEREST RATES WILL BE ZERO POINT HALF A PER CENT ZERO BY CHRISTMAS BUT CARNE WARNED HE CAN'T WORK MAGIC
TERRY POLICY CANNOT IMMEDIATELY OR FULLY OFFSET
THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF A LARGE NEGATIVE SHOCK OR OVER THE FUTURE POTENTIAL OF THIS ECONOMY AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR JOBS REAL WAGES IN WELL I'M NOT THE GUESTS ARE MONITORED POLICY MAKERS
THESE FUNDAMENTALS WILL BE DRIVEN BY MUCH BIGGER DECISIONS BY MUCH BIGGER PLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN FORMULATED BY OTHERS
JOINING ME TO DISCUSS THAT SPEECH IT WAS DOCTORS WORRY CHIEF ECONOMIST AT ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST KNOWN HEDGE FUND TOSCA FUND AND ALSO TO TALK ABOUT THE POST BRACED GOT A COMING DOCTOR WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF MARK CARNEY SPEECHES TODAY I MADE OF IT THAT HE NEEDS TO HAVE A CRASH COURSE IN MACRO ECONOMICS BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A MONETARY
CORRECTION THROUGH THE CURRENCY IN FACT HIS SPEECH HELPED BY SHAVING A FEW MORE PER CENT FROM STIRLING
I DO THINK THAT MARK CARNEY AND GEORGE OSBORNE ARE SPORT GOOD
AND HE DID ALLUDE TO THE FACT THAT HE'S ONE OF NINE MEMBERS OF THE M.P.C.
DO WE HAVE TO GO PARADE CUP WE DO AT POINT FIVE YOU COMPARE WHERE WE ARE WITH THE C.B.E. IN THE SWISS AND THE SWEDES WERE QUITE LOFTY THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THE EVENTS PLUS BROOKS IN CURRENCY MARKETS HAVE BEEN A BAD THING
FLIES IN THE FACE OF ALL MACROECONOMIC TEACHING IT'S MYSTIFYING TO ME ALSO THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE TONE OF THE SPEECH WASN'T HE I MEAN HE WAS ACCUSED BY NIGEL FARRAJ PARTICULAR TALKING DOWN THE ECONOMY DO YOU THINK THAT'S JUST A BIT OF THE SORT OF SOUND GREAT FROM THE FROM THE BRICKS AT US OR DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOME ULTIMATE SHOULD CENTRAL BANKERS B.P. TALKING IN THIS FASHION LET'S CALL SOMEONE BACK TO FRIDAY WHEN HIS PREDECESSOR MERVYN KING SPOKEN SPOKE AGAIN ON MONDAY
RATHER GRANTLY THINKING IS A FAR SUPERIOR MCCRACKEN HONEST THAN THEIR MARK CARNEY CARNEY AND AMATEUR BY COMPARISON BUT THE KING WAS VERY SANGUINE MENTION THE BENEFITS OF A WEEK A CURRENCY
TO TRY TYPICAL SECTORS DOMESTIC TYPICAL SECTORS AND LET'S REFLECT ON IT AND HE IS TIME THE AMOUNT OF CONFUSED NONSENSE BEING SPOKEN ABOUT THE ECONOMY THE ECONOMY
HASN'T PRODUCED ANY DATE HE HAD TO LOOK AT IT BEEN WEAK IN THE ABSENCE OF DATA IS TO BE KNIFE BUT HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU IGNORE ALL WHAT ALL BUSINESSES OF WOBURN OR BUSINESS OR MANY VISITORS ARE SAYING ABOUT HER DIFFICULT POST BRICKS AND ENVIRONMENT THEY HAD THE PROBLEMS WE HAD AND THE FOOTY TO FIFTY WHICH IS A VERY U.K. EXPOSED AND BECKS IT ISN'T IT A BIT IS THAT A FLYING IN THE FACE OF EVIDENCE TO SAY THAT HAS A VERY STRONG FUTURE THERE THE ECONOMY PRESSED BRICKS
I THINK YOU SHOULD STICK HERE TO GIVING TIPS ON HORSES RATHER THAN INVESTMENTS BECAUSE IN THE YEARS TIME THE FOOTSIE WOULD'VE BUT SO WHAT THE FORTY TO FIFTY WHICH IS A WONDERFUL IF WE GET YOU A YEAR'S TIME YOU'LL PUT SOME MONEY ON THE FACT THAT HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I'VE BEEN HERE THREE OR FOUR TIMES OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS AND EACH TIME BECAUSE WE PRODUCE SOME RESEARCH AND MADE SOME INVESTMENT
MY LAST VISIT HERE WAS TO BE MALIGNED BECAUSE WE WERE BUYING AGGRESSIVELY IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THE INVESTMENT WE MAKE THE PERFORM VERY STRONGLY SO I'D BE DELIGHTED TO COME BACK IN YES TIME TO GLOAT IT JUST JUST JUST GO BACK ON THERE SO WHAT WHY DO YOU THINK THEY'D BE THERE POST BRICKS AT THE ECONOMY HAS SUCH A STRONG FUTURE BUT ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE DRIVER BECAUSE I THOUGHT ECONOMICS AND I KNOW THE TRANSMISSION MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH A WEAK CURRENCY
COULD NOT FAIL TO LIFT AN ECONOMY IT IS MACRO ECONOMICS ONE I WON MAYBE NOT CONNIE SHOULD REALLY SPENT THE SUMMER GETTING HIS TEXTBOOKS OUT SO THE IDEA'S A WEEK YOU CAN'T WHO WILL HELP THE PRICE OF BRITISH EXPORT
YES THANKS YES THAT'S THE MACRO ECONOMICS ONE OH ONE BUT IT HELPS IT HELPS TOURISM HELPS MANUFACTURING JUST WATCH HAS
TOURISTS FLOOD TO THE U.K. TO CAPITALISE UPON THE PLANTING OUR FACTORIES A BENEFIT IT JANET'S INFLATION LET'S THING ABOUT MARK CARNEY KATE IS CURRENTLY IN BREACH OF HIS MANDATE INFLATION'S POINT THREE PERCENT
THE MANDATE IS TO BE BETWEEN ONE AND THREE SO HE'S CURRENTLY GETTING HAVING TO WRITE LETTERS TO THE CHANCE OF A POINTED HIM EXPLAIN WHY HE'S FAILING TO
CHIEF HIS MANDATE TO TO REPEAT THE COUNTRY DIDN'T COUNT IN NEED A RIGHT CUT IT NEVER NEEDED TAX RISES GEORGE OSBORNE SHOULDN'T BE CHANCELLOR AT THE AUTUMN STATEMENT HE WON'T
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR VOI FROM TUCKER FROM TOSCA FUND WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO HEAR A U.K. BASIN PISSED OF BEING POSITIVE ABOUT THE ECONOMY POST BRICKS BUT HOW ABOUT A FRENCH ONE
FUNNY ENOUGH THAT IS THE CASE YESTERDAY I SPOKE TO DELIA SAYS YOU'RE THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF CARMEN YET A GIANT FRENCH FUND THAT MANAGES FIFTY THREE BILLION EUROS' WORTH OF CLIENTS' MONEY HE SAID DOCTOR THERE'S A VOID THERE A WEEK A POUND WOULD HELP THE BRITISH STOCK MARKET
INITIALLY THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE U.K. MARKET TURN THE EURGH MARKET IN PARTICULAR IS THE CURRENCY OF THE CURRENCY IN THE U.K. IS SOME KIND OF AN ADDRESS TEAM VARIABLE ON THE WEAKER CURRENCY CAN MAKE UP FOR PART OF THE DAMAGE AXES FOR PART OF THE ECONOMY YOU'RE THE ONE THAT THAT'S EXPORTING SO YOU WERE IN THAT STAGE RIGHT NOW WHERE YOU HAVE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT ACCOMPANIES OTHER STOCKS THAT BENEFIT FROM A WEAKER CURRENCY AND THE OTHERS
SO THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE HERE SHOWN IN THE U.K. MARKET WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE IN THE OTHER MARKETS THERE WAS DEVIOUS AS YOURS HAVE COME IN CAN WITH ME NOW AS OUR MARKETS GUESS LAURA FALL U.K. EQUITY FUND MANAGER AT HENDERSON GLOBAL ABYSS OR I WON'T ASK YOU FOR YOUR OPINION OF MARK CARNEY BUT I WOULD ASK YOU WHAT'S GOING ON AN EQUITY MUG AT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE QUITE CONFUSED WE HAD THE BIG FALL IN THE FOOTSIE AFTER THE VOTE NOW WE MORE THAN RECOVERED ALL THEIR LOST GROUND ARE THE OPTIMISTS RIGHT
I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS WHERE YOU LOOK IN THE U.K. MARKET IF YOU LOOK AT COMPANIES THAT ARE VERY DOMESTICALLY EXPOSE LIKE THE HOUSE BUILDERS LIKE THE BANKS THEY'VE REMAINED QUITE POOR PERFORMERS AND I THINK THAT'S TELLING US SOMETHING ABOUT THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING HOUSE PRICES PARTICULARLY IN LONDON TO COME DOWN SLIGHTLY IN THAT WILL IMPACT THE HOUSE BUILDERS
PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY TO SLOW THAT WILL IMPACT THE BANKS COS NO INGRID WILL COME DOWN THEY COULD POSSIBLY BE HIGHER IMPAIRMENTS INLAY INTO THE BANKS SO THOSE ARE THE SICKNESS WHICH MIGHT DO WORSE EXACTLY MOST BRICKS WHAT ABOUT THE ONES THAT WILL DO WELL
ONCE IT WILL DO WELL OUR COMPANIES EXPORTING INTERNATIONALLY SO PHARMACEUTICALS FOR EXAMPLE WHO REALLY BENEFIT FROM THE LOWER STERLING AND HIGHER U.S. DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY SELL A LOT OF THEIR DRUGS INTO THE U.S. A LOT OF THE COST BASE IS HERE NEW BAIT ASTRA AND GLAXO HAVE THEIR HEADQUARTERS HERE COS THEREFORE BE LOWER THEREFORE THEY MORE COMPETITIVE SO THERE ARE SOME SECTORS THAT WILL BENEFIT I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE A BIT CAREFUL ABOUT SAYING THAT ALL EXPORTERS WILL BENEFIT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TRAY TIMES ARE COMING
SO IF YOU'RE A FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY NOT BE PASSPORT ING YOU CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY SAY THAT THEY WILL BENEFIT AND US WITH POINTY GET A LOT OF BRITISH EXPORTERS IMPORTANT FOR ONE OF THE COMPONENTS IN ORDER TO REPACKAGE THEM REASSEMBLE THEM AND SEND THEM OUT AGAIN EXACTLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T REALLY TOUCHED ON INPUT COST INFLATION FOR THEIR FEED RETAILERS FOR EXAMPLE
THEY IMPORT A LOT OF THEIR FOOD WILL THEY BE ABLE TO PASS THAT ON TO CUSTOMERS I THINK THAT'S A MASSIVE FOR DEBATE I THINK WE ACTUALLY WILL SEE GROSS MARGINS COME DOWN THERE IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN FOOD RETAIL IT'S JUST CHANGE TACK QUICKLY TO TO COVER A STORY THAT BROKE OVERNIGHT IN AMERICA IT'S A STORY THE BIG BRITISH ANGLE ACTUALLY BECAUSE MOM DELAUNAY'S WHICH IS THE COMPANY THAT BOUGHT CADBURY WITH HUGE CONTROVERSY IN TWENTY TIM
HAS MADE A TAKEOVER BID FOR HER SHE'S PROBABLY A VERY WELL KNOWN AMERICAN NOT SO WELL KNOWN NAME HERE IT'S INTERESTING IS IT TO SEE BIG TAKEOVER DEALS HAPPENING EVEN IN A TIME
OF UNCERTAINTY EXACTLY I THINK WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT UNCERTAINTY SPREAD TO THE U.S. AND EMMA IS STILL GOING FULL TILT IN THE U.S. I THINK WHAT WE'LL SEE HERE THOUGH IS IT IT'S A DECLINING CORPORATE ACTIVITY I THINK
GENERALLY IF YOU ARE A U.S. COMPANY IT'S QUITE RISKY TO BUY SOMETHING IN THE U.K. AT THE MOMENT GIVEN WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE TRADE DEAL HE'S GOING TO SETTLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH PEOPLE BEEN KEEPING THEIR POWDER DRY THINK MUCH LAWFUL FROM HENDERSON NOW IF YOU WERE TO THINK OF ONE BUSINESS ORGANISATION THAT WILL BE AFFECTED BY BRICKS AT IT WOULD BE HARD TO GO PAST ROYAL DUTCH SHELL THE GIANT OIL AND GAS OPERATION THAT'S THE BIGGEST COMPANY LIST ON THE LONDON MARKET NUMBER ONE OF THE PRETTY ONE HUNDRED
BUT EXACTLY STRADDLES THAT BRICKS IT DIVIDE IT HAS A ONE HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY AS AN ANGLO DUTCH COMPANY WITH HIT OFFICERS HERE AND THE MIDLANDS YESTERDAY I WENT TO THE OLYMPIC PARK IN EAST LONDON WHERE SHELL IS RUNNING A BIG ENERGY SAVING AND ENGINEERING EXHIBITION AND I MET THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE BINNED THEM AND ASKED THEM WHAT BRICKS AT MEANT FOR SHELL
THE HONEST ANSWER TO DAD'S IS WAIT AND SEE
OF COURSE WE HAD BEEN VOCAL IN SAYING THEY WOULD BE IN FAVOUR UP REMAIN AND SEE THAT THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WOULD COME FROM THE LEAF
ALSO THE CERTAINTY OF THE OUTCOME OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE Y. YOU WERE IN THE U.K. IS SOMETHING THAT'S THAT HAS MORE DOWNSIDE THAN UPSIDE
IT WILL ALSO BE A MAJOR DISTRACTION FOR MANY PEOPLE FROM ISSUES THAT UP IT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ON THE AGENDA BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT IS INDEED WAIT AND SEE NO I HOLD THEIR RELATIONSHIP
THAT WILL BE DEFINED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE U.K. AND HE WILL BE SEARCHED
PROMOTE AND GIVE US ACCESS TO A SINGLE MARKET
IDEALLY FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AS WELL FOR A COMPANY LIKE US IMPORTANT BUT THEY'RE STILL AND VERY LARGE HEADQUARTERS IN TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT WOULD BE SPECULATIVE TO SAY WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN DON'T BE SHORT
I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WE WILL STILL COMPLETE OUR INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES THAT WE HAVE IN THE U.K. WE WILL STOP PROVIDE ENERGY TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE U.K. WE WILL STILL EMPLOY PEOPLE IN THE U.K. RECRUIT PEOPLE IN THE U.K. SO IN THE SHORT AND THE WRISTS OF COURSE NOT
ISN'T SHELL ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A LITMUS TEST FOR THE NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE IT'S ALMOST UNIQUELY EXPOSED BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE U.K. WITH TWO HIT OFFICERS
IF YOU DON'T GET FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND CATTLE ISN'T IT AND BE ABLE TO PULL BACK YOUR U.K. OPERATIONS
I THINK IT WOULD BECOME A LESS EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING
BUT STILL THERE ARE GOING TO BE A FEW WHAT ARE REALITIES AS WELL BIG SISTER TO U.K. U.K. CONSUMERS WILL STILL NEED ACCESS TO ENERGY O.K. MAYBE RIGHT NOW LOTS OF ART
RETAIL OPERATIONS ARE EXES SUPPLIED ALSO MIGHT HAVE ROTTERDAM ALL THAT MAY BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT BUT IT WILL NOT BECOME IMPOSSIBLE
SOME OF OUR TRAINING OPERATIONS THAT ARE RUN OUT OFF LONDON INTEGRATE SEAMLESSLY RADAR TRADING AND ACTIVITIES IN ROTTERDAM BUT HOW THEREFORE PLAY OUT IT'S HARD TO SAY
WHEN IT STOP THIS IS ACTIVITY NOT OF COURSE NOT IT WILL JUST MAKE IT PERHAPS LESS EFFICIENT THERE WAS BEEN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ROYAL DUTCH SHELL THERE'S DOMINIC TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX JONATHAN SPORT

# THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL WILL LATER ALKALINE IN A SPEECH IN LONDON LABOUR'S STANCE ON THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF BRECHT'S IT AMID CONTINUING PRESSURE ON THE PARTY'S LEADER JEREMY CORBIN TO RESIGN IT'S THOUGHT THAT SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE JOINED THE PARTY IN THE PAST WEEK BUT IT'S NOT KNOWN IF THEY SUPPORT MISTER CORBIN OR WANT TO SEE HIM REMOVED
# COMMEMORATIONS ARE BEING HELD ACROSS THE U.K. AND IN FRANCE TO MARK ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE START OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME LAST NIGHT THE QUEEN LED A SERVICE AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY AT THE BEGINNING OF AN OVERNIGHT VIGIL THIS MORNING A TWO MINUTE SILENCE WILL BE OBSERVED IN THE U.K. JUST BEFORE HALF PAST SEVEN THE MOMENTS WHEN THE BRITISH AND ALLIED OFFENSIVE BEGAN
# SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'VE FOUND THE FIRST CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER ABOVE ANTARCTICA IS STARTING TO SHRINK THEIR FINDINGS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE SHOW THAT THE WHOLE SHRANK BY ONE AND A HALF MILLION SQUARE MILES BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND LAST YEAR
# A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S IS URGING THE GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE THE LAWS ON PROSTITUTION IN ENGLAND AND WALES SO THAT SOLICITING IS NO LONGER A CRIMINAL OFFENCE THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEES ALSO SAYS SEX WORKERS WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR OFFENCES RELATED TO PROSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS DELETED THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WILL CONSIDER THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS
# THE U.S. AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING THE FIRST KNOWN FATAL ACCIDENT INVOLVING A CAR BEING DRIVEN ON AUTO PILOT A DRIVER DIED WHEN HIS VEHICLE FITTED WITH TECHNOLOGY ALLOWING IT TO CHANGE LANES AUTOMATICALLY COLLIDED WITH A LORRY
# THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WHAT WOULD MICHAEL GOES BRITAIN LOOK LIKE WHAT IS HIS IDEAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION HE WILL SET OUT HIS STALL TODAY THAT SHOULD BE SAID THAT TODAY'S DAILY MAIL ART SETS IT MUST BE TERESA AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE FEELING AMONG MANY CONSERVATIVES NORMAN SMITH IS OUR SYSTEM
POLITICAL EDITOR WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON NORMAN WHAT SPECIFICALLY DO YOU THINK MICHAEL GO CAN SAY TODAY THAT MIGHT CONVINCE CONSERVATIVES TO SUPPORT HIM WELL I THINK IT'S FIRST TASK WILL BE TO CONVINCE CONSERVATIVES THAT IS REMOTELY SERIOUS ABOUT BECOMING PRIME MINISTER BECAUSE HE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS THAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE JOB HE DOESN'T THINK HE'S UP TO THE JOB HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT SO TASK ONE IS TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT IS SERIOUS IN TERMS OF HIS AGENDA I EXPECT HE WILL STRESS THAT HE IS QUOTES HEART AND SOUL BEHIND LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION HE WILL AGAIN FLAG UP PLANS FOR AN AUSTRALIAN STYLE POINTS SYSTEM TO CURB IMMIGRATION THOUGH I DOUBT HE WILL COMMIT TO ACTUALLY
REDUCE IT OR TO A TARGET AND I EXPECT HE WILL POINT TO HIS RADICAL REFORM OF SCHOOLS AND THE PRESENT SYSTEM TO INDICATE WHAT A BOLD REFORMER HE WOULD BE BUT I MEAN THE DIFFICULTY FACES FRANKLY ONE IT'S NOT JUST CONVINCING PEOPLE HE'S SERIOUS BUT HE IS ALSO A VERY DIVISIVE POLITICIAN ONE OF THE REASONS HE WAS MOVED FROM EDUCATION WAS BECAUSE HE WAS PERCEIVED AS TOO DIVISIVE AND THEREFORE IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE WHERE THE COUNTRY'S FACING HUGE UNCERTAINTY
IT SEEMS TO BE QUESTIONABLE WHETHER CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS WILL WANT TO OPT FOR SOMEONE WHO MAY NOT BE BEST EQUIPPED TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER ON TOP OF WHICH MANY OF BORIS JOHNSON'S SUPPORTERS FRANKLY WOULD RATHER VOTE FOR ANYONE NOW BUT
MICHAEL GO IT SEEMS TO ME THE PROSPECTS OF HIM ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING ARE PRETTY REMOTE BECAUSE THE CONSENSUS IS HIS AIM YESTERDAY WAS NOT SO MUCH TO PROMOTE HIMSELF BUT TO STOP BORIS JOHNSON THERESA MAY ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEADLINES AT LEAST EQUAL ON THE EDITORIAL COMMENT AS WELL ON THE UP
YEAH IT'S YOUR REMINDS ME A BIT LIKE A SORT OF THE FINAL SCENE FROM HAMLET WHERE EVERYONE'S DEAD ON STAGE AND KNIFED POISONED OR WHATEVER AND THERESA MAY STRIDES THROUGH THEM HANDS CLEAN BECAUSE SHE IS SORT OF UNSULLIED BY THE CARNAGE AROUND HER I THINK TO HER PITCH THE SERIOUS HARD WORKING COMPETENT POLITICIAN PLAYS EXACTLY INTO SORT OF THE MOOD IN THE TORY PARTY WHICH IS DESPERATELY CASTING AROUND FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN HOLD
SHOW ON THE ROAD AND CAN DO THE SERIOUS BUSINESS OF NEGOTIATING WITH BRUSSELS AND JUST LOOKING AT WHERE SHE IS NOW I MEAN I COUNTED MORE THAN SEVENTY M.P.S BACKING HIM SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE CABINET SHE HAS GONE OUT OF HER WAY TO REASSURE THE BRECK SIR TEARS PROMISING BRECK'S IT MEANS BRECHT'S IT SHALL SET UP A BRECHT SIT DEPARTMENT I MEAN SHE DOES HAVE HUGE MOMENTUM BEHIND HER AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME VERY HARD TO SEE WHO
WHO AT THE MOMENT CAN STOP US SUDDENLY MICHAEL GO OVER I THINK WE'LL STRUGGLE NOW TO GET CLOSE TO HER WE EXPECTING GEORGE OSBORNE TO COME OUT ANY TIME SOON IN THE PUBLIC ABOUT SUPPORT WELL IT'S INTERESTING MY GO FOR HAS DENIED THAT THERE IS ANY SHENANIGANS OR ANY INVOLVEMENT WITH WITH GEORGE OSBORNE WE SAID THE LAST TIME YOU SPOKE TO HIM WAS AFTER TUESDAY'S CABINET AND THERE WAS NO PLOT TO SORT OF DO IN BORIS JOHNSON
IT'S HARD TO KNOW IF IF IF THERESA MAY'S SUCCEEDS I IMAGINE SHE WILL WANT SOME STABILITY AND THEREFORE ALTHOUGH GEORGE OSBORNE'S A STANDING HAS BEEN IN A PROFOUNDLY DENTED OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS
BY HIS ROLE IN THE CAMPAIGN BY THE LAST BUDGET I WONDER WHETHER ACTUALLY THERESA MAY WILL LOOK FOR SOME STABILITY AND THE OTHER THING WHICH I THINK IS INTERESTING IS IN TERMS OF THE BRECK'S IT MINISTER MANY PEOPLE MIGHT THINK MICHAEL GAVE MIGHT BE THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATE I WONDER ACTUALLY IF SHE MIGHT GO FOR ANDREA LEAD SOME INSTEAD
# NORMAN THANK YOU WE WILL BE HEARING FROM LIAM FOX AFTER SEVEN AND KEN CLARKE AFTER TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN COMMEMORATIONS OF BEING HELD ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN FRANCE TO MARK ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE START OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME A CORRESPONDENT PETER HUNT IS AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY PETER WHERE THEY'VE BEEN HOLDING A VIGIL ALL NIGHT
YES THEY HAVE AND IN THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE ABBEY HAS BEEN OPEN FOR SUCH A VIGIL SINCE THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AGO BEGAN WITH A A CEREMONY LAST NIGHT ATTENDED BY THE QUEEN THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH THE PRIME MINISTER AND OTHER DIGNITARIES AND HAS CONTINUED WITH A A WATCH AT THE TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR WATCH THAT HAS CHANGED EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES MADE UP OF MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM THE U.K. AND OTHER COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES AND THEN OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND EACH WATCH THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO AND THEY'VE BEEN AN INDIVIDUAL
WHO FOUGHT AT THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY MOVING EVEN NIGHT
I THINK WHAT WAS STRIKING ABOUT THE CEREMONY WAS THE SERMON IT WAS DELIVERED BY THE BISHOP OF LONDON RICHARD CHARTERS AND HE GAVE IT TO A CONGREGATION OF THE COUNTRY AS YOU WERE JUST REFLECTING THAT HAS A FEVER A POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE AS WE REFASHION OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW
THE LEGACY OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME SHOULD BE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD WALKED TOWARD WORK TOWARDS RECONCILIATION HE SAID THAT WE SHOULD REJECT THOSE WOULD STIR UP HATRED AND DIVISION AND HE SAID WE SHOULD DO THAT WITH THE WISDOM SEWN IN BLOOD AND TEARS IMAGINE MANY PEOPLE THINKING THIS DOES OF COURSE PUT POLITICS INTO PERSPECTIVE
THEY'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON THAT LATER WHEN THIS VIGIL HERE AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY DRAWS TO A CLOSE THEY'LL BE A READING FROM THE WORDS OF SOMEONE WHO WAS WAITING TO GO OVER THE TOP BACK ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHO'D SURVIVED INTO THE FIRST DAY OF THE SOMME AND LIVED ON TO RECALL THOSE MOMENTS IN THE BOOK THERE'LL BE A MILITARY
BOMBARDMENT BY THE ROYAL HORSE ARTILLERY WHICH WILL BE TO TRY AND EVOKE THAT SOUND THAT ONE WEEK LONG BOMBARDMENT WAS INFLICTED ON THE GERMANS THE PLAN BEING THAT IT WOULD WEAKEN THE DEFENCES IT FAILED AND SO THESE MEN LITERALLY WALKED INTO THE WAVE UPON WAVE OF GERMAN MACHINE AND ARTILLERY
GUNFIRE AND THEN WE WILL OBSERVE THE SILENCE IN THE U.K. AND ON B. B. C. RADIO AND THEN THE WHISTLES BLEW A WHISTLE USED IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR OR WHISTLE WILL BLOWING WESTMINSTER ABBEY AND ON PARLIAMENT SQUARE AND THAT OF COURSE WAS THE SIGNAL ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO AT SEVEN THIRTY ON THE FIRST OF JULY WHEN THOSE MEN WENT OVER THE TOP AND MANY MANY DIDN'T RETURN
# PETER MANY THANKS TIMES TWENTY TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS DOMINATED BY WHAT THE DAILY MAIL CALLS THE TORY DAY OF TREACHERY MICHAEL GOES ENTRY INTO THE RACE TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON'S DEPARTURE FROM IT AMOUNTED TO WHAT THE MALE CALLS THE MOST SAVAGE BLOOD LETTING IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY SINCE MARGARET THATCHER WAS TOPPLED THE AYE AYE BORROWS FROM MUCH FURTHER BACK IN HISTORY ABOVE A PICTURE OF AN APPARENTLY CRESTFALLEN MY JOHNSON IT'S HEADLINE IS SET TO GO
BRECK'S ACCUSING IT IS THE SUN'S VERDICT BORIS JOHNSON'S COME FROM BRECK'S AT HERO TO ZERO IN A WEEK IT'S AT THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WHICH MISTER JOHNSON ROAD CAR WRITES A COLUMN FOR HAS AN ACCOUNT OF HOW MISTER GO REVEALED HIS INTENTIONS TO DO BORIS JOHNSON'S CAMPAIGN MANAGERS ARE LYNTON CROSBY AT EIGHT FIFTY THREE YESTERDAY MORNING AT THE MAN WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING UP THE DREAM TICKET WITH MY JOHNSON HAD NOT SO MUCH STABBED HIM IN THE BACK
AS WE RUN HIM THROUGH WITH A PIKE SCARF TO DAILY MAIL'S QUENTIN LETTS DESCRIBES THE MOMENT BORIS JOHNSON ANNOUNCED THAT HE WASN'T STANDING THERE WAS A LACUNA HE RIGHT AND IN AUDIBLE GULP
THE SILENCE IN WHICH SECOND HAND'S TICKED IT WAS THE DAILY EXPRESS SAYS QUITE ASTOUNDING POLITICAL THEATRE WANT TO AS THAT MAYBE FOR THE TIMES AND THE TELEGRAPH IS ALSO A SENSE OF HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF THE TELEGRAPH REMINDED ITS READERS OF HAROLD MACMILLAN'S NIGHT OF THE LONG KNIVES RESHUFFLE IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO GEOFFREY HOWE'S ATTACK ON MARGARET THATCHER IN HIS RESIGNATION SPEECH THEN A REMINDER IT SUGGESTS
BLOOD LETTING IS COMMONPLACE IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE TIMES NOTES HOW YESTERDAY'S EVENTS CONFORM TO ANOTHER TRUISM OF TORY HISTORY THE LEADERSHIP FRONT RUNNER NEVER WINS BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATING THAT IT REPRODUCES HER TOES HEADLINE FROM OCTOBER SIXTY THREE THAT READ THE QUEEN MAY SEND FOR MISTER BUTLER TODAY
# THAT AFTERNOON THE PAPER NOTES HER MAJESTY INSTEAD INVITED ALEC DOUGLAS HUME TO FORM AN ADMINISTRATION SEVERAL PAPERS USE THE CONTEXT OF BRECHT'S IT TO CONTEMPLATE THE CENTENARY OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME THE M.P. DOCTOR ANDREW MORRISON PRIME MINISTER'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE GREAT WAR CENTENARY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE REFERENDUM HAS BEEN AN APPALLINGLY DIVISIVE TUSSLE WRITING IN THE TELEGRAPH HE URGES PEOPLE TO USE THE ANNIVERSARY OF WHAT WAS BRITAIN'S BLOODIEST BATTLE
THE HEEL AND UNITE THE GUARDIAN'S EDITORIAL OFFERS A REMINDER THAT WE SHALL ALWAYS BE PART OF EUROPE IT CONCLUDES THAT IT'S PEACE AND OURS ARE ONE AND THE SAME
# SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT END THE SUN ON THE STAR ALSO URGES THE ENDING OR AT LEAST A SUSPENSION OF ANOTHER OLD ELEMENTS EITHER OUT OF ENGLAND FOOTBALL FANS TOWARDS THEIR WELSH COUNTERPARTS WALES PLAY BELGIUM IN EURO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TONIGHT AND ARE THE LAST REMAINING HOME NATION IN THE TOURNAMENT AHEAD OF THE TIDE OF THE STAR LIST TEN REASONS TO LOVE WALES ON IT INCLUDING THE ABILITY OF WELSH
ALWAYS SING IN TUNE THE SUN IF ONLY IN ITS LEADER SAYS AFTER WHAT HE CALLS ENGLAND'S EURO DISGRACE WE SHALL ALL BE WELSH TONIGHT GORDY THE TIMES HOWEVER THERE IS SCANT EVIDENCE OF SUCH CHARITY ELSEWHERE IN THE U.K. IT REPORTS BOOMING SALES OF REPLICA ICELAND SHIRTS AFTER THE TEAM KNOCKED ENGLAND OUT OF THE TOURNAMENT FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THAN THE MANUFACTURER TELLS THE PAPER HAD BEEN ORDERED IN SQUATS
# THE TIME SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEND MEN HEADLINE THAT MICHAEL GO HE'S GOING TO SET OUT HIS CLAIM FOR THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP TODAY THE FRONT RUNNER THERESA MAY HAS WON THE BACKING OF TWO MORE CABINET MINISTERS AND THE DAILY MAIL
THE DRAMATIC MANOEUVRINGS THE SENIOR RANKS OF THE CONSERVATIVE OR LABOUR PARTY'S REVERBERATED INSIDE THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER YESTERDAY HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN WHOM IF M.P.S HAD COME ALONG TO THE COMMONS CHAMBER TO CLUTCH AT A LITTLE BIT OF NORMAL ROUTINE AMIDST THE SCARY POLITICS OUTSIDE THEY COULD FORGET IT SOMETHING ELSE TO MAKE THEM JUMP FROM BEHIND THE OPPOSITION DESPATCH BOX MAYBE A TAD SURPRISED SPEAKING TO SEE ME IN THIS POSITION
BECAUSE FOR THE PAST TWENTY SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN A BACKBENCHER BY CHOICE AND THAT WASN'T JUST MY CHOICE IT WAS THE CHOICE OF A TIME LEADERS OF MY PARTY
YES THE NEW SHADOW LEADER OF THE COMMONS IS PAUL FLYNN VETERAN BACKBENCHER AND REBEL THE RESIGNATION OF MOST OF JEREMY CORBIN'S SHADOW MINISTERS HAS AT LEAST ALLOWED THE PARTY TO BRING ON NEWISH TALENT
WE HAVE A TOTAL ABSENCE ON THE FINAL DAY WAS OF DID YOU
I BELIEVE GOD MY POINT WE TURNED TO THESE POST WILL BE AT SWALE BOYS
MISTER FLYNN IS EIGHTY ONE JUST A FEW MONTHS OLDER THAN CHURCHILL WHEN HE LEFT NUMBER TEN SO MAYBE THERE'S TIME YET BUT PERHAPS UNLIKE OTHERS OF HIS GENERATION HE WANTS A SECOND REFERENDUM WITH A DIFFERENT RESULT CHRIS GRILLING THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE REMEMBERED THAT MISTER FLYNN HAD ACTUALLY WRITTEN BOOKS ON BEING A BACKBENCH M.P. WAS A USEFUL ADVICE
FOR EXAMPLE HIS ADVICE TO THE MINISTER OF WAR IN MINISTER IN WAITING CULTIVATE THE VIRTUES OF DULLNESS AND SAFETY
WHO KNOWS IF BORIS JOHNSON HAD READ THAT BIT CHRIS GRAYLING BACK THERE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AND HE DIDN'T THINK A SECOND REFERENDUM WAS A GOOD IDEA I'M A FAMOUS OF BEEF IT JUST DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT ANY MORE THAN I'M GOING TO ASK FOR A RE MATCH BETWEEN ICELAND AND ENGLAND'S THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN WE'VE HAD OVER
WE'VE HAD A RESULT THAT'S DEMOCRACY IF WE HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION ON A SIDE LOSES WE DON'T GET ANOTHER GO A MONTH LATER THE S.N.P. SPOKESMAN PETE WISHART CONGRATULATED CHRIS GRAYLING AFTER A FASHION FROM BEING ON THE WINNING SIDE WELL DONE
WELL DONE BECAUSE THIS IS AS MUCH AS ME VICTORY AS IT AS A RIGHT HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN FROM OXBRIDGE MADGE
IN THE REST OF THE U.K. I CLICK AND TO THE VICTOR WHO WANTS A SPOIL
AND FLOPPED A SPOILS HE HAS GOT ANOTHER BIG COUNTRY AT IN ECONOMY UGLY RESUS ATTACKS IN A STREET A NATION
AND CONFUSE THEIR PARTNERSHIP
AND THE GOVERNMENT WITH AN IDEA ON A PLAN
CHRIS GRAYLING HAD HEARD ENOUGH LOOK SCOTLAND VOTED TO BE PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
YOUR KINGDOM VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN
I'M AFRAID IT IS DEMOCRACY
EVEN SO MUCH OF THE NORMAL BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT NOW SEEMS TO BE ON HOLD AS THE CONSERVATIVES LOOK FOR A NEW PRIME MINISTER AND POSSIBLY NEW MINISTERS AND THAT'S ALREADY EVIDENT IN PARLIAMENT YESTERDAY THE TRANSPORT SECRETARY PATRICK MCLOUGHLIN ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'D BE NO ANNOUNCEMENT THIS SUMMER ON HEATHROW EXPANSION
BEING REALISTIC GIVEN RECENT EVENTS I CANNOT NOW WILL SEE A LANDS MONTH UNTIL AT LEAST OCTOBER AND HERE'S THE BUSINESS MINISTER GEORGE FREEMAN ON SOME PRIVATISATION PROPOSALS I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
THOSE CURRENTLY LOOKING TO FORM THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL WANT TO DO WHEN THEY ARE IN OFFICE AND THE HOME OFFICE MINISTER MIKE PENNING COULDN'T DO MUCH BETTER WHEN IT CAME TO CHANGING THE LAW ON HOMICIDE AT THIS INTERESTING TIME IN POLITICS IN THAT'S BEST RUNNING THE COUNTRY
IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT FOR ME TO INDICATE THAT WE WOULD AGREE OR
THEY'LL BE HOPING THAT NORMAL SERVICE CAN BE RESUMED IN THE AUTUMN BUT FOLLOWING THE REFERENDUM SOME WINDS GO DEEP AND HEALING MUST BEGIN AS THE M.P. FOR CATRIN THE CONSERVATIVE AND LEAVE SUPPORTER PHILIP HOLBORN REVEALED HE COMPLAINED THAT THE STAR OF THE HIT TEEN MOVIE MEAN GIRLS HAD BEEN VERY MEAN INDEED
LONG REFERENDUM NIGHTS A WEEK AGO THE PRO REMAIN AMERICAN ACTRESS LINDSAY LOHAN SERIES OF BIZARRE TWICE
SLAGGED OFF AREAS OF THIS COUNTRY WERE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND AT ONE POINT YOU DIRECTED A FIERCE AND OFFENSIVE TWEET AT KETTERING CLAIMING SHE'D NEVER HEARD OF IT AND IMPLYING THAT NO ONE KNEW WHERE IT WAS
APART FROM THE FACT THAT IT MIGHT BE THE MOST AVERAGE TOWN IN THE COUNTRY EVERYONE KNOWS WHERE KETTERING BUT IN A SPIRIT OF RECONCILIATION HE SUGGESTED THAT LINDSAY LOHAN COULD MAKE AMENDS BY COMING TO SWITCH ON KETTERING'S CHRISTMAS LIGHTS THIS YEAR
# SUSAN HUME A REPORTING MORE FROM WESTMINSTER FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AT EIGHT THIRTY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE TIME NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN COMMEMORATIONS AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING ALREADY BEING HELD ACROSS THE U.K. AND IN FRANCE TO MARK THE CENTENARY OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME AND BATTLE IN WHICH TWENTY THOUSAND BRITISH TROOPS DIED ON THE FIRST DAY ALONE AND MORE THAN A MILLION
VARYING NATIONALITIES BY THE TIME THE BATTLE ENDED AND JIM WITH HEARD FROM ALREADY IN THE PROGRAMMING GO BACK TO HIM NOW BECAUSE HE JOINS US LIVE FROM THE SCENE OF THE BATTLEFIELD GENT INDEED JUSTIN GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN PART OF THE CROWD COMING HERE FOR THE SOME COMMEMORATION AT THIS PLACE AT THE CHIP VAL MEMORIAL HONOUR ON A LONG RIDE SWITCH IS RIGHT WITH A GERMAN OR BRITISH LINES WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER WHERE THERE WAS VERY MUCH FIGHTING EARLY IN THE BATTLE
WE'LL BE YOUNG THE BRITISH COUNCIL HAS ORGANISED A GROUP OF SIX HUNDRED SCHOOL CHILDREN BRITISH IRISH
AND FRENCH WHO SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME PREPARING FOR THE VISIT LEARNING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE HOW IT AFFECTED FAMILIES LIKE THEIR OWN AND PERHAPS EVEN QUIET
I SPOKE TO THREE OF THEM WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN ON THEIR WAY HERE TO THE BATTLEFIELD
AND THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY OF BOWL HAVE TOOK AND PARTING IS FULL AND THERE'S AFFECTED EVEN PEOPLE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEIR RELATIVES HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE WAR SO YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING BACK AT THE FAMILY STORIES FROM YOUR AREA IN EAST LONDON YES AND WE FOUND OUT THEY'LL THE CEMETERY
WE DECIDED TO GO THERE AND WE ALL HAD A SPECIFIC SOLDIER THERE WE LOOKED SO WE FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEIR FAMILY
AND THESE WERE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE BURIED AT HOME RATHER THING BEING BURIED IN THE BATTLEFIELD BECAUSE OF THE HORRIFIC NESTLED THOUGH WHY THEY COULDN'T TELL WHO WAS HERE SO THEY JUST
DID THIS CEMETERY LYING AND DE DUST
SOME NAMES AND WHERE THEY PUT THE WHAT DO YOU WITH AND ACTUALLY UNDERNEATH WITH US HERE IS DAMN GILMAN WHO'S HEAD OF HUMANITIES AND THEREFORE TEACHES HISTORY AT SCHOOL
WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN TRYING TO DO IN THESE LAST SIX MONTHS AND PREPARING FOR THIS TRIP THE TWO DOZEN OR SO STUDENTS AT YOU'VE GOT WHO ARE GOING TO BE HERE WHAT ARE THE WHAT BEHIND WILL HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GO
I THINK THE CHALLENGE WAS TO MAKE THE ONE HUNDRED YEAR OLD WALL
WE THINK OF US AS WHITE ENGLISH SOLDIERS MAKING IT RELEVANT TO ACCURATELY MUSKRAT KITS A BENGALI OR THOSE EUROPEAN AND TO MAKE THEM CARE ABOUT THE SOLDIERS
AND THAT WAS THAT EASY OR DIFFICULT ACTUALLY IT'S MUCH EASIER THAN I THOUGHT
IT'S JUST SHAM PIGEON THE STREET THEY'D HAVE DONE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE SIZE OF THEIR FAMILIES ALL THESE THINGS LIKE EVEN THOUGH IT'S A WHITE BRITISH SOLDIER THE STREET THE FAMILY THE COMMUNITY WHERE HE CAME HOME AND THE KIDS REALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT AND REALLY CARED ABOUT HIS SOLDIERS YEAH THOSE LOTS OF DIFFERENT BRITISH COLONIES FOR EXAMPLE
THE INDIAN PEOPLE YOU'RE HAVE A BENGALI FAMILY WERE BORN IN EAST LONDON SO YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN THAT YEAR BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF FAMILY MEMBERS FROM INDIA A SUPPOSED TO PEOPLE OF YOUR GENERATION WHO LISTEN TO THE RADIO OR TURN ON TELEVISION AND SEE THAT THERE IS WAR STILL GOING ON
HE REALISED THAT THIS KIND OF CONFLICT HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US FOR PEOPLE OF OUR GENERATION IT'S NOT THAT EASY
THERE'S PEOPLE IN OTHER GYRATIONS OUT BEFORE US STEVE ACTUALLY LIVED THERE WHY THEY KNOW HOW IT IS A WEE GIRL WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND WE HAVE IT SEEMED SUFFERS OF WARS OR HOW PEOPLE USED TO RUSH PEOPLE USED TO CROWD FOR THEIR LOVED ONES AT NIGHT
I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT FOR US WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A TERRIBLE CENTURY OF DIFFICULTY AND VIOLENCE WASN'T IT
BECAUSE LOTS OF COUNTRIES WON'T LET DOWN
AND THEY WANTED TO SHOW THAT THEY WERE MORE POWERFUL FOR THEY CAME INTO A LOWER TREE AND STARTED FAKE TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE LETTING STRONG AND THE AMBOS PIP A I LOVE PEOPLE SUFFERED JUST BECAUSE
DO YOU WANT TO I DO OTHER COUNTRIES WANTED TO SHOW THEM THAT THEY'RE MORE POWERFUL
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY JUST WANTED TO SHOW OFF IN
PUT THAT THEY'RE THE BEST AS YOU GROW UP YOUR GENERATION WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU NEED TO DO I THINK I NEED TO LOOK BACK ON HISTORY AND SEE WHAT HE HAS
IN THE WARS BEFORE OI PEOPLE USED TO BE RAY THEATRE YOU YOUR OTHER STUFF HE'S A HARM OTHERS NOW YOU AGAINST THE LAW WE CAN'T DO THAT UNLESS OR COME THE WATER SHOW US
IS SOMETHING THAT KARMA IF YOU DO SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU YOU THINK WE HAVE TO LEARN FROM HISTORY HAVE YOU HOPE SO ANYWAY HEY YEAH HOPEFULLY
SOME OF THE SCHOOL CHILDREN WILL BE HERE THAT CHAP FELL ON THE SOMME TODAY WE'VE COME TO COMPREHEND IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS SOMETHING OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE AT THE START OF A BATTLE THAT LASTED FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE DAYS AND LEFT THIS PLACE A BARE AND BARREN SITE IT'S LAND WHERE FARMERS STILL FIND AS THEY PLOUGH THE FIELDS ARMAMENTS EMERGE FROM THE SOIL
AND SEVERAL TIMES EACH YEAR SOME OF THE LOST AND BURIED COME TO THE SURFACE
AFTER DECADES AND DECADES AND NOW ONE HUNDRED YEARS
# OF COURSE IN FRANCE WE SHALL HEAR MORE FROM HIM DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN PARLIAMENT SHOULD CHANGE THE LAWS ON PROSTITUTION SO THAT WOMEN WHO SELL SEX ON THE STREETS CAN NO LONGER BE CHARGED WITH A CRIMINAL OFFENCE THE LAWS WOULD CHANGE IN RELATION TO BROTHELS AS WELL THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF A REPORT BY THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE OF EM PEAS NIKKI ADAMS AS A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE ENGLISH COLLECTIVE OF PROSTITUTES AND PRESUMABLY YOU SUPPORT THIS
YES WE'RE VERY GLAD WE WE REALLY WELCOME THERE REPORT THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB IN THAT THEY THEY RECOMMEND DECRIMINALISATION OF SEX WORKERS ON THE STREET AND IN PREMISES SO THAT WOMEN CAN WORK TOGETHER IN SAFETY
THEY WERE SO COOL FOR CONVICTIONS TO BE SCRUBBED FROM RECORDS SO THAT'S AND THAT'S A BIG OBSTACLE FOR WOMEN GETTING UP THE JOBS AND I THINK IT'S THIS IS THE MOST SENIOR PARLIAMENTARY BODY I THINK THAT'S LOOKED INTO THE ISSUES SO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING DECRIMINALISATION IS VERY ENCOURAGING WHAT THEY DON'T DO IS THEY HAVEN'T TACKLED
SOME OF THE ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN A MASSIVE RISE IN PROSTITUTION AND LIKE UNDER AUSTERITY LIKE BENEFIT SANCTIONS I THINK THIS IS AN INTERIM REPORT AND WE WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO LOOK AT THOSE KIND OF ISSUES BY SEPTEMBER OR THE AUTUMN WHEN THEY'RE PLANNING TO BUT BUT ARE WE READY FOR THIS DOES THE COUNTRY WON SUCH A DRAMATIC CHANGE SO THAT WOMEN WOULD BE ABLE TO SOLICIT ON THE STREET WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF
THE POLICE TELLING THEM TO CLEAR OFF I THINK EVERYBODY'S READY FOR SAFETY I THINK EVERYBODY RECOGNISES THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS FOR HAVEN'T GOT EXTRA WORKERS WHERE THEY DO HAVE TO DO IT I MEAN AT THE MOMENT THE THERE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE INCREASE IN PROSTITUTION BECAUSE OF BENEFIT SANCTIONS BECAUSE OF A WHOLE SET OF THE ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN I MEAN IF YOU'RE LEFT WITH NO MONEY AT ALL YOU ARE LIKELY TO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE
FEW OPTIONS THAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH AND SO THAT HAS TO REALLY BE TACKLED BUT I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF WHETHER WE'RE READY FOR IT I THINK PEOPLE RECOGNISE THAT IT'S A MASSIVE CRISIS THAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE WHERE OUR LOT HAVE BEEN TRIED AND IT DID AT THIS SORT OF TOTAL DECRIMINALISATION NEW ZEALAND IS THE PLACE WHERE IT'S BEEN TRIED AND IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL THERE IT DID INCREASE SAFETY IT TRANSFORMED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEX WORKERS AND THE POLICE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD COME FORWARD AND REPORT VIOLENCE WHICH IS REALLY CRUCIAL
IT ACTUALLY REMOVED PROSTITUTION FROM THE CRIMINAL LAW AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MODEL THAT WE ARE REALLY PRESSING LOVE LET LET'S HEAR FROM AND LIGHT HOLD FROM THE COALITION AGAINST TRAFFIC IN WOMEN WHO WAS THERE WHO SPEAKS ABOUT THE SITUATION IN NEW ZEALAND
AFTER A PIMP BIG INSECT SPYING WAS DE CRIMINALISED IN NEW ZEALAND BROTHEL OWNERS ENDED UP WIELDING FAR GREATER POWER OVER PEOPLE AND PROSTITUTION SHARON THE UNITED STATES STATE DEPARTMENT EVALUATED THE SITUATION IN NEW ZEALAND VERY RECENTLY AND IT'S TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT
AND FOUND THAT THE TRAFFICKING OF ASIAN WOMEN IN TUNISIA LUND IS THRIVING SO FAR FROM EMPOWERING
PEOPLE IN PROSTITUTION DECRIMINALISATION EMPOWER US THEIR EXPLOITERS AND LICKING ADAMS THAT MUST BE A REAL PROBLEM WELL IT'S NOT TRUE I MEAN IT'S COMPLETELY AGAINST EVERY OTHER REVIEW OF THE NEW ZEALAND DECRIMINALISE MODEL THAT WE'VE EVER HEARD OF INCLUDING FROM PEOPLE THE NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT AND THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT TO RELY ON THEIR ASSESSMENT WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THAT WHOLE TRAFFICKING REPORT IS USED AS A POLITICAL
YOU KNOW TO BE CUT TO BE COUNTRIES THAT THE U.S. DISAPPROVES OF SO A VERY QUICK THOUGHT THOUGH THE CHANCES OF THE LAW BEING CHANGED GIVEN EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON IN POLITICS AT THE MOMENT IS NOT LIKELY IN THE NEAR FUTURE IS IT WELL IT'S A GOOD REASON TO KEEP JEREMY CORBIN COS HE'S AGREES FOR DECRIMINALISATION SO I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE FRANKLY ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH THROUGH MINISTER SEVEN PETER GIVES A SALEABLE

THE SOUND OF WHISTLES PIERCED THE QUIET PLANES OF THE SOMME AS BRITAIN AND FRANCE MARKED THE MOMENT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN ALLIED TROOPS WERE SENT OUT FROM THE TRENCHES TO TAKE GERMAN LINES
MANY OF THE BRITISH MEN WERE VOLUNTEERS WITH NO EXPERIENCE OF WAR
ALMOST ONE IN FIVE WERE KILLED THAT DAY AS THEY WALKED SLOWLY AS COMMANDED INTO GERMAN FIRE
IT WAS THE BLOODIEST DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE BRITISH ARMY HAD TIP FELLS MEMORIAL TODAY THE PRINCE OF WALES WILL JOIN DAVID CAMERON AND THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS LAWNED IN LAYING WREATHS TO ALL THOSE KILLED AND INJURED IN THE FOUR MONTH BATTLE ON BOTH SIDES MORE THAN ONE MILLION MEN
# THE U.S. AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING THE FIRST KNOWN FATAL ACCIDENT INVOLVING A VEHICLE BEING DRIVEN ON AUTO PILOT THE DRIVER OF A TESSLER ELECTRIC CAR DIED IN A COLLISION WITH A LORRY IN FLORIDA AS HE WAS USING TECHNOLOGY WHICH ALLOWS THE VEHICLE TO CHANGE LANES AUTOMATICALLY TESSLER SIR DRIVERS WERE WARNED ABOUT KEEPING THEIR HANDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL AT ALL TIMES EVEN WHEN THE AUTOPILOT WAS TURNED ON
# A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S IS URGING THE GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE THE LAWS ON PROSTITUTION IN ENGLAND AND WALES SO THAT SOLICITING IS NO LONGER A CRIMINAL OFFENCE THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE SAYS ALSO SAYS SEX WORKERS WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR OFFENCES RELATED TO PROSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS DELETED THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WILL CONSIDER THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS
# RESEARCHERS SAY THEY HAVE THE FIRST CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER OVER THE ANTARCTIC HAS BEGUN TO SHRINK SCIENTISTS SAY IT'S NOW ONE AND A HALF MILLION SQUARE MILES SMALLER THAN IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND BECAUSE OF THE DECLINE IN THE USE OF CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS OR C.F.C.S HERE'S OUR ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT MATT MCGRATH
A DRAMATIC THINNING OF THE OZONE LAYER WAS FIRST DETECTED IN THE STRATOSPHERE ABOVE ANTARCTICA IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SCIENTISTS WERE WORRIED AS THIS LAYER PROTECTS HUMANS ANIMALS AND PLANTS FROM THE DESTRUCTIVE IMPACT OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION THEY QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT C.F.C. CHEMICALS WIDELY USED IN REFRIGERATOR SPRAYS AND AIR CONDITIONING WITH A KEY IN THE EXTREME COLD OF THE SOUTHERN POLAR REGION THEY REACTED TO DESTROYED THE PROTECTIVE OZONE BLANKET
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN SPARKED A GLOBAL AGREEMENT CALLED THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL WHICH BANNED THE USE OF C.F.C.S IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE ELIMINATION OF THESE GASES CAUSED THE SLOWDOWN IN THE RATE OF INCREASE OF THE ANTARCTIC OZONE HOLE BUT THIS NEW PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THE FIRST FINGER PRINTS OF HEALING HAS BEGUN AND THE OZONE IS GROWING AGAIN
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE WHOLE DECREASED BY AN AREA ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF INDIA THE RESEARCHERS BELIEVE THAT A COMPLETE RECOVERY IS NOW POSSIBLE BY THE MIDDLE OF THE CENTURY
# POLICE IN BANGLADESH SAY A HINDU PRIEST HAS BEEN HACKED TO DEATH THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AND SECULAR WRITERS BY SUSPECTED ISLAMIST MILITANTS THE PIECE WAS PREPARING FOR MORNING PRAYERS AT THE TEMPLE WHEN THREE MEN ATTACKED HIM WITH MACHETES
# BRITAIN'S BIGGEST ENERGY SUPPLIER BRITISH GAS HAS TO OFFER HOUSEHOLDS FREE ELECTRICITY DURING THE DAYTIME ON SATURDAYS OR SUNDAYS CUSTOMERS WITH SO CALLED SMART METERS WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DEAL WHICH THE COMPANY CLAIMS WILL SAVE A TYPICAL HOUSEHOLD SIXTY A YEAR HOWEVER THE TARIFF IS STILL MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MANY OF THE FIXED PRICE DEALS OFFERED BY BRITISH GAS AS RIVALS
# THE WALES FOOTBALL TEAM PLAY THEIR BIGGEST GAME IN NEARLY SIXTY YEARS TONIGHT WHEN THEY TAKE ON BELGIUM AT THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP IN FRANCE THOUSANDS OF WELSH SUPPORTERS HAVE TRAVELLED TO LILLE FOR THE QUARTER FINAL A CORRESPONDENT HELL GRIFFITH IS THERE TOO
AS THE ONLY HOME NATION LEFT IN EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN WALES NO THEY'VE ALREADY EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS NOW THEY FACE THE TEAM RANKED AS THE SECOND BEST IN THE WORLD DESPITE BEING THE UNDERDOGS WHALES CAN APPROACH THE GAME WITH BELCHER WAS SOME CONFIDENCE HAVING BEATEN THEM IN THEIR LAST ENCOUNTER TWELVE MONTHS AGO
THOUSANDS OF WELSH SUPPORTERS HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED IN LILLE HOPING TO SEE A PIECE OF SPORTING HISTORY THE NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WORLD CUP WALES TEAM WERE KNOCKED OUT BY BRAZIL AND A GOLD BY A YOUNG MAN CALLED PALAIS IF WALES WIN TONIGHT THEY WILL SURPASSED THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THEIR PREDECESSORS AND FIND THEMSELVES JUST A GAME AWAY FROM THE FINAL
# THAT WAS HOW GRIFFITH REPORTING THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN FIVE CANDIDATES STANDING TO BE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER AND THEREFORE THE PRIME MINISTER OF THIS COUNTRY AT THIS TIME OF THE GREATEST PEACE TIME TURMOIL THERESA MAY AND STEPHEN CRAB WERE BOTH FOR REMAINING IN THE E.U. MICHAEL GO BAND HE LETS THEM LIAM FOX WERE FOR LEAVING WHAT ALL OF THEM NEED TO TELL US ABOUT NOW
IS THERE A PLAN WHEN WILL WE LEAVE THAT UNION AND ON WHAT TERMS AND I MET ALL HER MACHINATIONS AND MANOEUVRINGS YESTERDAY ONE CANDIDATE LIAM FOX WAS VERY PLAIN ABOUT ONE ASPECT OF HIS PLAN I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ROOM FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE SINGLE MARKET HE SAID IF IT ENTAILS THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE MY FOXES HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THAT MEANS YOU ARE PROMISING A CUT IN IMMIGRATION
WELL IF WE DON'T GET CONTROL OF FREE MOVEMENT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE REDUCTIONS IN MIGRATION OF COURSE THE QUESTIONS WHETHER WE GET THE CHOICE IN THE NUMBERS BUT WE WILL NOT GET THAT CHOICE UNLESS WE'RE OUTSIDE FREE MOVEMENT IN FACT I THINK THAT YOU REFER TO THE DEBATE WE ARE NOW TEN WEEKS AWAY FROM HAVING A NEW PRIME MINISTER WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ELECTING THE PRIME MINISTER WHO WILL ACTUALLY TAKE US OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND YET WE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY DISTRACTED BY WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS THE POLITICS OF THE OXFORD UNION IN RECENT DAYS COME ONTO THOSE DISTRACTIONS IN A SECOND BUT JUST JUST ON YOUR PLAN SO YOU'RE RULING OUT A NORWAY OPTION SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ACCESS TO THE CINEMA GOING TO BE MEMBERS OF THE SINGLE MARKET YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME KIND OF A DEAL CAN BE DONE TO GET HER SOME SORT OF ACCESS TO IT BUT IT WILL BE LESS THAN WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET TO SELLING TO THE SINGLE MARKET THAT'S THAT'S RATHER OBVIOUS
COUNTRIES LIKE THE UNITED STATES DO THAT EASILY AND NOR DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE TO BE IN THE SINGLE MARKET FOR EXAMPLE WERE IN ROMANIA AND BULGARIA CAME INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY DID NOT HAVE FREE MOVEMENT BUT THEY WERE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET IS HE POLITICAL CHOICE IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR TRADE AND WHAT WE NEED TO GET IS A SENSIBLE APPROACH FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR THOSE LISTENERS WHO HELD SO ON NEWSNIGHT LAST NIGHT YOU MUMS FROM THE Y. YOU TREAT COMMISSIONER
HAD THE MOST BIZARRE POSITION SET OUT SHE SAID FIRST YOU LEAVE THEN YOU NEGOTIATE AND WHEN SHE WAS WHEN SHE WAS NOT JUST HER THAT'S THE POSITION AND WHEN SHE WAS THEN ASKED WHETHER STICKING TO SUCH A PROCESS WOULDN'T HARM ALL THE E.U. ECONOMIES SHE SAID YES NOW HOW BIZARRE OR HOW STUPID IS THAT HAVE A POSITION WHERE YOUR RULES PRECLUDE A NEGOTIATION TO THE EXTENT THAT WOULD HARM ALL THE E.U. ECONOMY SO WHAT WE NEED TO GET NOW
IT'S A POSITION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TALKS TO THE ELECTED GOVERNMENTS ACROSS EUROPE AND SAYS THE POSITION OF THE COMMISSION IS PREPOSTEROUS IT WILL HARM ALL EUROPEAN ECONOMIES IF THAT IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE IT IS IN NOBODY'S INTEREST FLAW IN THAT ARGUMENT SURELY IN THE FLOOR WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT WE CAN GET SOME KIND OF A REALLY GOOD DEAL BUT STILL HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER IMMIGRATION IS THAT IF THEY WERE TO DO IT FOR US THEY WOULD BE FORCED TO CONSIDER DOING IT FOR OTHERS AND FOR THAT REASON
YOU KNOW HOW POLITICS WORKS IT WILL MAKE THE POLITICS IN THIS IN EUROPE VERY VERY POWERFUL IN SPITE OF WHAT SOME EUROPEAN BUSINESSES MIGHT BE SEX WELL IT'S UP TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS ACROSS EUROPE AND NEED TO BE RE ELECTED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A DEAL WITH THEIR EXPORT BUSINESS AS A VIABLE AND IF YOU FOLLOW THIS COMMISSION'S RIDICULOUS POSITION
THEN YOU WOULD BE HAVING HER POSITION NEXT YEAR WERE MISSUS MERKEL AT PRESENT OR NANTES HAD TO FACE THEIR ELECTORATES TELLING THEM BUT JUST TO PUNISH BRITAIN AND TO STICK TO A PREVIOUSLY REGARDED POSITION BY THE COMMISSION THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A DIMINUTION OF THE EXPORTS OF FRENCH WINE AND GERMAN CARS THIS CANNOT MAKE SENSE IN THE REAL WORLD THAT YOU DO EXCEPT WITH THE TERMS OF OUR ACCESS TO THE FREE MARKET WILL NOT BE AS GOOD AS THE TERMS WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT WHEN WE'RE FULL MEMBERS THAT IT WILL BE SOMETHING REDUCED FROM THAT
WE DON'T WANT FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SAY IN COMMON FISHERIES POLICY OR COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY OR ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT GO WITH THAT WE SIMPLY WANT TO BE PART OF THE TRADING RELATIONSHIP AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS FOR A EUROPEAN TRADING PARTNERS YOU THE REAL COUNTRIES NOT THE COMMISSION TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH US THAT GIVES US ACCESS TO ONE ANOTHER'S MARKET IN OUR MUTUAL BEN IF YOU MENTION THE POLITICS OF THE OXFORD UNION RIGHT IN THE CAN WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU SAW YESTERDAY AND YOUR PARTY
I THINK IT WAS A DISTRACTION WE NEED BRICKS IT FOR GROWN UPS AND WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE THE BIGGEST USER NOT OWN UP CANDIDATE THEY'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT OUR AIMS ARE TREATING POSITIONS THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT WHAT OUR SECURITY RELATIONSHIP WILL BE ALSO WHAT DOMESTIC CHANGES WILL HAVE TO MAKE HER WILL WE HAVE TO RESTRUCTURE OUR GOVERNMENT WE HAVE TO CHANGE WHITEHALL WILL HAVE TO RE INTRODUCE FOR EXAMPLE A DEPARTMENT OF TRADE
THAT SIT ALONE WITH THAT SIT INSIDE THE F.C.O. HOW WILL THAT OR WHAT WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR OUR SPENDING PRIORITY REASON IS TALKING ABOUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE HOW HOW ARE YOU SEPARATING YOURSELF FOR INSTANCE FROM HER I THINK WE NEED TO START TO PUT SOME OF THE FLESH ONTO THE BONES THEY'RE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE WOULD BE FOR EXAMPLE IF WE'RE SETTING UP A NEW DEPARTMENT OF TRADE WE SET UP INSIDE THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN TRADE SO THAT WE CLOSE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED OUR FOREIGN POLICY
AND OUR TRADE POLICY I WOULD ULTIMATELY LIKE TO BRING DIFFERED BACK INTO THAT AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK AID TRADE AND FOREIGN POLICY ACTUALLY GO TOGETHER AND HAVING THEM DISLOCATED IS BAD FOR THE U.K. JUDGEMENT IS ACTUALLY LYNCH WOULD SING IN ALL OF THIS ISN'T IT AND IT DOESN'T THAT CAUSE A DIFFICULTY FOR YOU COS YOU DID HAVE TO RESIGN OVER A QUESTION OF JUDGEMENT THIS BUSINESS WITH ANDREW VERITY THAT FRIENDS DO WITH WHOM I DON'T KNOW ADAM VERITY SORRY WITH YOU
HAD CONNECTIONS AND YOU DECIDED TO RESIGN YOU WERE CRITICISED BY THE CABINET SECRETARY I JUST WONDERING IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES WHETHER THAT MAKES YOU SOMEONE WHO IS LESS QUALIFIED TO DO THIS JOB WELL I'VE ALWAYS TAKEN THE VIEW THAT IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE WE MAKE AN APOLOGY YOU MAKE AMENDS AND YOU TRY TO LEARN FROM IT AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I LEARNED IN POLITICS THAT SOMETHING I LEARNED AS A DOCTOR
AND I THINK IF WE TAKE THE VIEW THAT IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE THAT DOESN'T ENABLE YOU TO CARRY ON IN YOUR PROFESSION THEN YOU GET VERY FEW PROFESSIONALS INDEED AND I THINK THAT IN THE TIME IN BETWEEN NOT ONLY HAVE I
TRAVELLED EXTENSIVELY AND LEARNED EXTENSIVELY BUT I THINK THAT I'VE WORKED VERY HARD IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND I THINK THAT THIS DEBATE IS THE MOST VITAL AND IMPORTANT DEBATE THIS COUNTRY HAS HAD PROBABLY IN A CENTURY AND I WANT TO MAKE MY CONTRIBUTION TO THAT IN THIS UP TO MY COLLEAGUES TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU THINK THE ARGUMENTS I MAKE ARE IMPORTANT OR NOT
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS NEEDS TO BE ABOUT THE FUTURE NOT ABOUT THE PAST DID DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THAT YOU HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING A ARE YOU IN THIS TO MAKE A POINT AND TWO TO HAVE A SAY LATER ON I'M IN THIS TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ARGUMENTS AND TO SET UP WHAT I THINK THIS COUNTRY OUGHT TO BE DOING THIS IS NOT AN ELECTION IT WAS HAVING TO BE THAT YOU DON'T IMMEDIATELY SAY MELISSA'S I CAN WITNESS THIS IS THIS THIS IS AND THIS IS NOT AN ELECTION WE'RE HAVING IN OPPOSITION
YOU CAN MAKE POINTS WHERE YOU CAN MAKE POSITIONS
THIS IS ABOUT THE POLICIES WILL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT WHAT I'M DOING IN THIS IS SETTING OUT AN AGENDA THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO IMPLEMENT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND I'M IN THIS CONTEST TO WIN IT BECAUSE I THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST AND I THINK WE NEED TO GET BACK TO POLICY AND PRINCIPLES NOT PERSONALITY NAME FOX THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# SIXTEEN MINUTES WE ALL WORRY ABOUT PENSIONS MOST OF US DO ANYWHERE THERE IS ONE COMPANY ROYAL DUTCH SHELL THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN THAT CONTEXT AND DOMINIC YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO HIS BOSS IS A HEAVEN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED LIKE ALL OF US ON HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE TO ENJOY IT IN YOUR RETIREMENT YOU NEED TO WATCH ONE COMPANY LIKE A HAWK AND THAT HIS WORLD THAT SHELL THAT'S BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS IT THE BIGGEST COMPANY ON THE LONDON MARKET
BUT IT'S THE BIGGEST PAYER OF DIVIDENDS INTO PENSION FUNDS IT NOW ACCOUNTS FOR ONE POUND IN EVERY SIX PAID OUT BY THE LONDON MARKET THAT'S ONE COMPANY GENERATING AT ELEVEN BILLION POUNDS A YEAR FOR PENSIONS BUT CAN HE KEEP IT UP AS OR PRICES FOR ITS REVENUES ARE UNDER PRESSURE SO I ASKED THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE BEING IF HE CAN KEEP THE MONEY MACHINE GOING
NOW PROBABLY IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE LARGEST OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE LARGEST DIFFIDENT PLAYERS GLOBALLY IT'S FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF DIFFIDENT SO THEY'D SAY THAT'S A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY BY ALL NATIONS BUT IT'S ALSO A VERY VERY IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE INDEED AS YOU SAY DOMINIC THESE DIFFIDENCE FLOW INTO PENSION FUNDS AND FLOW INTO OTHER
ROLF PROVISION SCHEME FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE ORDINARY PEOPLE
MAY NOT EVEN RECOGNISE THAT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT FACT AFFORD SO WE TAKE A DIFFIDENT COMMITMENT SIRIUS THE BOARD REFUSED TO BE EVIDENCE OF CAUSED THE POLICY FROM TIME TO DUNK A POLICY HASN'T CHANGED
AND A TRACK RECORD I THINK IS IS VERY VERY STRONG MUST NOT WE'VE GROWN THE DIFFIDENT IN LINE THAT UNDERLYING EARNINGS GROWTH AND FOUR LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR YOU SAID TO BE ACTUALLY GOING TO FIX A DIFFIDENT
AT ONE DOLLAR EIGHTY EIGHT AND FOUR IS A SAFE AND SECURITY
HE'S YOUR JOB'S SAFE IF YOU CUT THAT THERE
I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S
IF WE ENDED UP FINDING THAT'S A DIFFIDENT WOULD NOT BE SUSTAINABLE THERE WOULD BE A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES FORWARD
I DON'T THINK YOU WILL FIND OUR SHAREHOLDERS ASKING FOUR OF THEM WILL BE BY THE WAY SHAREHOLDERS WILL BELIEVE OVER DISTRIBUTING BUT THE MAJORITY OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS BELIEVES DENSE TO SORT OF DIFFIDENT
WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT IS THAT RIGHT
ARE YOU GETTING FRUSTRATED IN THE U.K. NOT MAKING A PROPER COMMITMENT TO CARBON CAPTURE
I WAS DISAPPOINTED I THINK IT'S NO USE TO GET FRUSTRATED AND THESE SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I FIND ENCOURAGING IS THAT AT THE SAME TIME THE U.K. GOVERNMENT ALSO WAS VERY CLEAR
I FEEL C. C. S. HAS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION IF THEY ARE GOING TO LIVE BY THE COMMITMENTS HAVE HAVE BEEN
TO REDUCE C.O.TWO EMISSIONS SIGNIFICANTLY EIGHTY PERCENT BY TWENTY FIFTY COMPARED TO NINETEEN NINETY C. C. S. IS NOT A COMMERCIAL PROPOSITION SO WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE A COMMERCIAL
PREFERABLY BY PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT PRIZE ON CARBON SO THAT IT WILL BE IN NORMAL BUSINESS PROPOSITION FOR US TO INVEST IN IT AND AS LONG AS THAT IT'S NOT
AS LONG AS WE STILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE SOME ASPECTS OF THAT COMMERCIAL ARE LEGAL ASPECTS THERE PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK WITH GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
YOU HAD THE MONEY RING FENCED EVEN IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT
DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT FROM AN AFFORDABILITY PERSPECTIVE DO INVEST IN THIS SO YES OF COURSE WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED HE HAD SPENT
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE BAD AS PROJECT IN THEN FOUND THAT IT CAN GO AHEAD THAT WAS BEEN OVERRULED THAT SHELL
# THEY'VE DONE IT TWENTY PAST SEVEN HERE'S A BIT OF SERIOUSLY GOOD NEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT FOR A CHANGE SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND THAT THE HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER OVER THE ANTARCTIC HAS BEGUN TO HEAL WITH THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD IS RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE SCHOOL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT THAT LEEDS UNIVERSITY ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS ON THE STUDY AND I'M ALSO ON HERE IN THE STUDIO BY PETER GIBBS WHO'S
WELL WHY DO I NEED TO TELL YOU ANYWAY HE'D HIS MATE TELL US WHAT YOU DISCOVERED
YES HELLO JOHN SAW OUR STUDY FOR THE FIRST TIME SHORE'S ACTUALLY THAT THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THEY'RE ALWAYS ON HALL IN SEPTEMBER FIND ARCTIC CAR IT'S GETTING SMALLER AS COMPARED TO THE SIZE OF YOURS ON HALL IN THE LATE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES AND THIS IS REALLY GOOD NEWS BECAUSE IT INDICATES THAT INDEED ALWAYS ON LEO IT'S HEALING
AH TO WHAT EXTENT CAN YOU PUT OF MEASUREMENT ON IT OF SOME SORT YES SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE SIZE OF DOORS ON HALL IN THE LATE NINETIES IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY MILLION SQUARE KILOMETRES AND LOUD EVER TO SIZE OFF THE ALWAYS ON HALLWAY IS ABOUT SIXTEEN
SCRAP MILLION SQUARE KILOMETRES SO THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE OF FOUR MILLION SCRATCHING KILOMETRES AND JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT FOR THIS THIS IS THE SAME SIZE AS AS INDIA OR SIXTEEN TIMES THE SIZE OF THE U.K. WEATHER WAS A VERY BIG INDEED IT EXACTLY
AND YOU CAN BE SURE THAT THAT ISN'T JUST THE SORT OF ONE OFF FOR NEXT YEAR MAYBE IT WILL BE BIGGER AGAIN AND SO ON AND SO ON SO I SHOULD ACTUALLY STRESS THAT I'M REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE AVERAGE SIZE AND SO ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS WE ACTUALLY SEE VARIATIONS IN THE SIZE OF THOSE ON HOY FOR EXAMPLE UNTIL SOME YEARS IT'S SMALLER I DO YES IT'S BIGGER BUT THE TREND CLEARLY INDICATES THAT ON AVERAGE IT'S SHRINKING AND WILL THEREFORE DISAPPEAR
YES EVENTUALLY IT WILL DISAPPEAR AND WE CAN ALSO ESTIMATED BY WERE TIMED AS WHAT HAPPENED AT THE SINK THIS CAN HAPPEN BY MID CENTURY SAW TWO THOUSAND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY SO YES EVENTUALLY THEY CLOSE WELL THANK YOU THAT THAT IS GOOD NEWS PETER
IT IS GOOD NEWS JOHN PUTTING CONTEST THIS IS SAYING BASICALLY IT'S NOT QUITE AS BAD AS IT WAS IT'S ANYA SAYS THIS IS A VERY VERY LONG TERM PROCESS COS YOU WERE IN IT YOU SAY LONG TERM YOU WERE IN IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING YOU WERE IN ANTARCTICA I WAS THAT WAS MY FIRST JOB AS A METEOROLOGIST AT HALLEY RESEARCH STATION RUN BY THE BRITISH ANTARCTIC SURVEY WHERE ONE OF MY DAILY JOBS IS ACTUALLY TWO TO MEASURE OZONE USING AN INSTRUMENT CALLED A DOBSON SPECTROPHOTOMETER INVENTED BY AN OXFORD SCIENTIST BASICALLY
IT IS BACK SHED AND I WAS VERY LUCKY THERE TO RETURN THEIR RECENTLY FOR HORIZON AND RADIO FOUR TO FIND AT THE VERY SAME MACHINE IS STILL TAKEN THOSE MEASUREMENTS AND THAT ALL IMPORTANT WE'VE GOT A SIXTY YEAR RECORD OF EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING OVER ANTON OF ON THAT ON THAT SAME MACHINE ON THAT VERY SAME EXTRAORDINARY COS THAT'S HOW LONG AGO THAT YOU WERE THERE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES
FROM EIGHTY TO EIGHTY TWO IT'S JUST AFTER THAT THAT HE WAS FIRST PICKED UP THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE EARS AND THE PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE I WAS IN CONTACT JOHNSON SHANKLIN YESTERDAY ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE ORIGINAL PAPER TO SEE WHAT HIS THOUGHTS WERE ON THIS THIS LATEST DISCOVERY THE FACT THE THINGS A RECOVERY AND REMIND THOSE OF US WHO WEREN'T AROUND AT THE TIME WHY WE GOT SO WORRIED ABOUT IT
BECAUSE C.F.C.S WHICH ARE BASICALLY BEING USED IN REFRIGERANTS AEROSOL CANS THE PROPELLANT FOR AEROSOL CANS ARE FINDING THEIR WAY INTO THE POLAR ATMOSPHERE INTO THE STRATOSPHERE DURING THE WINTER THEY WERE BECOMING CONCENTRATED IN WHAT'S CALLED THE POLAR VORTEX THIS BIG MASSIVE A. COLD AIR THAT SITS OVER THE HIGH ATMOSPHERE OVER THE POLE AND THEN AS THE SUN RETURN AT THE END OF THE ANTARCTIC WINTER
IN SEPTEMBER ONWARDS AUGUST SEPTEMBER ONWARDS OZONE WAS BITS BEING DESTROYED VERY RAPIDLY BY ESSENTIALLY THE CHLORINE THAT IS IN C.F.C. AND WE NEED THEM BECAUSE BECAUSE IT PROTECTS US FROM ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION IN FACT A RECENT STUDY SHOWED THAT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL TREATY THAT ACTUALLY BANNED C.F.C. PRODUCTION
THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MILLIONS OF CASES OF SKIN CANCER AS A RESULT OF LACK OF ACTION AND IT WAS INDEED THE CASE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN THERE WERE MORE SKIN CANCERS AS A RESULT OF THE WHOLE AND I THINK WE DON'T WANT TO GET COMPLACENT I DID A REPORT FOR COS IN THE EARTH READY FOR IN MAY LAST YEAR THAT COMMEMORATE THE PUBLICATION OF THE PAPER AND ACTUALLY
C.F.C.S ARE STILL FINDING THEIR WAY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE ILLEGAL C.F.C.S IT SEEMS THERE'S A BLACK MY LEGAL CAUSE A FREE LAY GOT SOMETHING THAT'S RIGHT EXACTLY THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACED BUT OLD STOCKPILE SCENE TO BE FIND THEIR WAY ONTO THE BLACK MARKET THERE'S A BIG INCREASING DEMAND FOR REFRIGERATION IN A DEVELOPING PARTS OF THE WORLD AND THAT SEEMS TO BE PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF BLACK MARKETING IS RIGHT BUT WE CAN KEEP AN EYE ON THAT AND SO FAR SO GOOD WE'RE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IT'S A LONG LONG HAUL STILL
PETER AND DOCTOR SMITH THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED
# AT THIS MOMENT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO TODAY BRITISH TROOPS WHO FOUGHT IN THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME WERE STANDING IN THEIR TRENCHES WAITING FOR THE SIGNAL THAT WOULD SEND THEM OVER THE TOP FOR CENTENARY MARK TODAY COMMEMORATIONS IN FRANCE AND IN THE U.K. THAT A SKIRT OVER NOW TO PETER HUNT AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY TO TALK US THROUGH THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE
GOOD MORNING FROM WESTMINSTER ABBEY AN ALL NIGHT VIGIL AT THE GRAVE OF THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE THE QUEEN LAID A WREATH HERE YESTERDAY EVENING
MILITARY PERSONNEL AND OTHERS HAVE KEPT VIGIL EACH WHAT HAS LASTED FIFTEEN MINUTES EACH ONE HAS FOCUSED ON AN INDIVIDUAL WHO FOUGHT OR SERVED DURING THE BATTLE
IN PARLIAMENT SQUARE AS YOU CAN HEAR THE GUNS OF THE KING'S TROOP ROYAL HORSE ARTILLERY
EVERY FOUR SECONDS FOR ONE HUNDRED SECONDS ON THIS THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE START OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME THE FIELD GUNS WERE USED IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR THEY'VE BEEN FIRED NOW TO REVOKE THE SENSE OF INTENSE ARTILLERY BOMBARDMENT THAT WAS INFLICTED ON THE GERMANS BEFORE THE MAIN BATTLE STARTED BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN THIS SHELLING LASTED FOR ONE
THIS IS MEANT TO HAVE BEEN A MAJOR ALLIED EFFORT ON THE WESTERN FRONT THE FRENCH DISTRACTED BY THE BATTLE OF HER DONE THE BRITISH UNDERTOOK THE MANUS
THE BOMBARDMENT THE SOUND OF WHICH IS BEING RECREATED HERE NOW IN FRONT OF THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT WAS MEANT TO DESTROY THE GERMAN TRENCH
TO ALLOW THE BRITISH TO ADVANCE UNIMPEDED ACROSS NO MAN'S LAND THE BATTLE WITH BRINGING THE WATER AND
THE PLAN FAILED FOR SEVEN DAYS BEFORE THE JULY THE FIRST ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SHELLS WERE FIRED AT GERMAN LINES ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM DIDN'T EXPLODE
THE GERMANS REMAINED COMPARATIVELY SAFE IN THERE DEEP DOG
TO TAKE US BACK TO THAT TIME THE ACTOR LUKE THOMPSON WILL VERY SHORTLY READ AN EXTRACT FROM THE BOOK MY BIT A LANCASHIRE FUSILLI ARE AT WAR
SO NOW THESE GUNS WILL SOON FALL SILENT THIS ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE WILL BE RED INSIDE WESTMINSTER ABBEY AND THEN HERE ON B.B.C. RADIO AND ACROSS THE U.K. ARE TWO MINUTES' SILENCE WILL BE OBSERVED
HUNDREDS OF MEN IN FULL FIGHTING KIT AND STRANGELY QUIET CAME STREAMING DOWN PACKING THE FRONT LINE AND RESERVE TRENCHES
WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE HUGE MINE UNDER BEAUMONT HAMEL WOULD BE BLOWN UP AT SEVEN THIRTY A.M. AND THE GREAT EXPLOSION WILL BE THE SIGNAL TO GO OVER THE TOP
WE TOOK UP OUR POSITION IN A COMMUNICATION TRENCH LEADING INTO THE FRONT LINE AND WE STOOD RATHER SILENTLY
WONDERING IF WE HAD MUCH LONGER TO LIVE
AND SUDDENLY BRUSHING THE UGLY THOUGHT OF DEATH AWAY
JUST AS THE WAITING WAS BECOMING UNBEARABLE AND THE TERRIBLE STRAIN CAUSING SOME MEN TO WATER ALMOST ON NATURAL NOISES WE FELT A QUEER DOLL THUD
AND OUR TRENCH FAIR THEY'VE ROCKED AND A GREAT BLUE FLAME SHOT INTO THE SKY CARRYING WITH IT HUNDREDS OF TONS OF EARTH
A GREAT MIND HAD GONE UP IT WAS SEVEN THIRTY ZERO
THE CHIMES OF BIG BEN SIGNAL THE END OF THE TWO MINUTE SILENCE AT THIS VERY MOMENT SEVENTH
FIRST OF JULY NINETEEN SIXTEEN A WHISTLE LIKE THIS ONE WAS BLOWN AND THE MEN HEADED TOWARDS THE GERMAN LINES
SUDDENLY RECALLED ONE SOLDIER LATER WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF A STORM A MACHINE GUN BULLETS AND I SAW MEN BEGINNING TO TWELVE ROUND AND FALL THE BRITISH DEATH TOLL ON THIS ONE DAY WAS NINETEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY
IT'S THIS LOSS AND THE MANY OTHER LATER LOSSES THAT WILL BE REMEMBERED AS WE MARK THE CENTENARY OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME
# AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY THE TIME IS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO EAT YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS AND CHRIS ALDRIDGE WITH A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS
THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO WITH THIS TO MAKE THE FIRST SPEECH OF HIS CAMPAIGN TO BE THE LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND PRIME MINISTER YESTERDAY MY WITHDREW HIS SUPPORT FOR THE BOOKMAKERS EARLY FAVOURITE BORIS JOHNSON TO ANNOUNCE HE WAS STANDING HIMSELF THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY A NEW FRONT RUNNER HAS THE SUPPORT OF MORE THAN SEVENTY TORY M.P.S INCLUDING SEVEN CABINET MINISTERS
# THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL WILL SET OUT LABOUR'S POSITION ON THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF BRECHT'S IT TODAY HIS SPEECH COMES AMID CONTINUING PRESSURE ON JEREMY CORBIN TO RESIGN AS PARTY LEADER SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE JOINED THE PARTY IN THE PAST WEEK BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THEY SUPPORT MISTER CORBIN OR WANT TO SEE HIM REMOVED
# COMMEMORATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE TO MARK THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME MORE THAN A MILLION SOLDIERS WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED IN FIGHTING THAT LASTED FIVE MONTHS A TWO MINUTES' SILENCE HAS JUST BEEN OBSERVED IN THE U.K. AND VIGILS HAVE BEEN HELPED THROUGH THE NIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN NORTHERN FRANCE THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE AND DAVID CAMERON ARE AMONG THOSE WHO WILL ATTEND A SERVICE OF REMEMBRANCE OF THE MEMORIAL TO THE MISSING IN THE FRENCH TOWN OF TIP LATER
# THE U.S. AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING THE FIRST KNOWN FOR TALENT HE LINKED TO A CAR USING SELF DRIVING TECHNOLOGY THE COLLISION IN FLORIDA IN MAY INVOLVE DE TESSLER ELECTRIC CAR WHICH IS FITTED WITH AN AUTO PILOT ALLOWING IT TO CHANGE LANES AUTOMATICALLY TESSLER SAID THE CAR FAILED TO SLOW DOWN AS IT DIDN'T SPOT A LORRY IN AN ADJACENT LANE
# SCIENTISTS SAY THEY FOUND THE FIRST CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER ABOVE ANTARCTICA IS BEGINNING TO SHRINK THEIR FINDINGS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE SHOW THAT THE WHOLE SHRANK BY ONE AND A HALF MILLION SQUARE MILES BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND LAST YEAR
# POLICE IN BANGLADESH SAY A HINDU PRIEST HAS BEEN HACKED TO DEATH THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON RELIGIOUS MINORITIES BY SUSPECTED ISLAMIST MILITANTS AND OFFICIALS SAID THE PIECE WAS PREPARING FOR MORNING PRAYERS AT THE TEMPLE WHEN HE WAS ATTACKED
# TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S THE BEST PART OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS SINCE PEOPLE STARTED SAYING THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND DESPERATELY NEEDED MORE AIRPORT CAPACITY HEATHROW SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER RUNWAY AND SO ON THERE WAS MASSIVE OPPOSITION JUST FROM HEATHROW'S COMPETITORS BUT FROM ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAID HEATHROW WAS THE WRONG AIRPORT IN THE WRONG PLACE LAST YEAR IT SEEMED THE ARGUMENT MIGHT BE COMING TO AN END A COMMISSION SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT CHAIRED BY SIR HOWARD DAVIES PRODUCED A REPORT RECOMMENDING THE HEATHROW RUNWAY SHOULDN'T THEY GO AHEAD AND JUST WENT
EVERYONE THOUGHT THE AGA MIGHT FINALLY BE OVER THEY GOVERNMENT HE'S DELAYED DECISION YET AGAIN IT HAS BEEN PUT BACK UNTIL WE HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER SOME TIME MAYBE IN OCTOBER WELL SIR HOWARD IS WITH ME AND YOUR REACTION TO THAT SO I WANT THIRTY FIVE YEARS YES AND YOU'VE BEEN ON THE TODAY PROGRAMME ALL THAT TIME TOM I BUT VERY CLOSE WELL I THINK THAT WE ARE NOW IN AN INTERESTING NEW SITUATION POST
BREAKS IT AND I THINK THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DECISION HAS RISEN BECAUSE UNDOUBTEDLY INTERNATIONALLY REGS IT IS BEING SEEN AS A SOMEWHAT INSULAR SIGN A SIGN OF BRITAIN TURNING IN ON ITSELF THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT
THE ADVOCATES I WANTED AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A BROADER TRADING RELATIONSHIP A COUNTRY THAT SEEKS OUT MARKETS IN THE GROWING PARTS OF THE WORLD IN ASIA ET-CETERA BUT I THINK A REAL SYMBOL OF OUR WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT WOULD BE A DECISION ON INCREASED AIRPORT CAPACITY BECAUSE I TRAVELLED THE WORLD WHEN I DID THIS STUDY
PEOPLE DID SEE IT AS A TOUCHSTONE REALLY OF THE U.K.'S WILLINGNESS TO PREPARE ITSELF FOR THAT WORLD AND WILLINGNESS TO MAKE ITSELF ACCESSIBLE TO THESE NEW MARKETS WHETHER FOR PASSENGERS OR INDEED FOR AIR FREIGHT SO I THINK THAT NOW WE REALLY NEED THIS DECISION MORE THAN EVER I UNDERSTAND WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAVE PUT IT OFF UNTIL
A NEW PRIME MINISTER WAS APPOINTED BUT I THINK THEY'RE AFTER IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO GIVE A SIGN THAT THIS IS NO LONGER BLOCKED IT TOOK ABOUT A SYMBOL BUT A VERY EXPENSIVE VERY DISRUPTED VERY POLLUTING SYMBOL
IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR THE INVESTORS IT'S NOT A PUBLIC PROJECT SO IT'S A SECOND THE PAPAL EXPENSIVE IT IN FACT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH I SEE THERE'S AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE ONE THING THAT WE ARE ALSO GOING TO NEED IN THIS COUNTRY IS MORE INWARD INVESTMENT MANY INWARD INVESTMENT PROJECTS CURRENTLY ON HOLD DUE TO UNCERTAINTY
THIS WOULD BE FUNDED LARGELY BY OVERSEAS INVESTORS AND THAT KIND OF INFLOW IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED
NOW ON THE COSTS TO INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORRYING ABOUT THAT AND THERE'S A LOT OF PROPOSALS INVOLVING ANNOYS LEVY INVOLVING A BAN ON FLIGHTS IN THE EARLY MORNING WHICH IRRITATE PEOPLE A LOT INVOLVING A LOT OF MEASURES TO REDUCE
TRAFFIC AROUND THE AIRPORT TO RIB IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND HEATHROW HAS NOW ACCEPTED THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS SO I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE A PROJECT NOW READY TO GO WHICH MEETS MANY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL OBSTACLES IN ITS WAY AND WITHOUT WANTING TO REOPEN THE WHOLE DEBATE BECAUSE IT MIGHT TAKE US ANOTHER THIRTY FIVE YEARS I THINK THERE IS GATWICK GATWICK COULD HAVE BEEN THE ANSWER
YES GATWICK IS NO POLITICALLY NO EASIER AND THE KEY POINT ABOUT GATWICK IS IT IS PRIMARILY AN OUTBOUND LEISURE AIRPORT AT THE MOMENT AT THE MOMENT BUT THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO CHANGE THE FOCUS OF AN AIRPORT
IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THE AIR FREIGHT POINT IS ONE WHICH I THINK PEOPLE UNDER EMPHASISED THE VOLUME AND VALUE OF THEIR FREIGHT GOING THROUGH HEATHROW'S HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES
WHAT GOES THROUGH GATWICK AND THERE IS NO LOGISTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SO IT'S NOT AGAIN YOU COULD BUILD AT THE AIRPORT IT'S NOT JUST A QUESTION OF BUILDING THE AIRPORT RUNWAY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MANAGEABLE PERFECTLY MANAGEABLE AT GATWICK BUT ALL THE COMPANIES WHO SERVICE THAT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO MOVE THAT IS A MUCH MUCH BIGGER EXERCISE AND THERE IS NO CERTAINTY AT ALL THAT YOU WOULD PRODUCE THE SAME KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THAT WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT COULD DECREE
BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PRESUMABLY WHO ARE SIMPLY NOT CONVINCED IT HAS TO BE DONE AT ALL THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS EXPANSION WHY DO YOU NEED ALL THESE FAT CAT BUSINESSMEN COMING IN HERE SWITCHING TO ANOTHER AEROPLANE FLYING OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE AT VAST COST MAY BE THE ARGUMENT HAS PASSED ITS SELL BY DATE MAY BE PEOPLE IN THE END YOU'RE GOING TO SAY LOOK HE'S BEEN A MANAGER THIRTY FIVE USED MANAGE WITHOUT IT FOR ANOTHER THIRTY FIVE YEARS
ARGUMENT IS NOT DEPEND ON TRANSIT PASSENGERS THERE ARE SOME TIPPEX THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO SEED NEW ROOTS BUT THEY ARE NOT IN MY VIEW THE ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROJECT AT THE ECONOMIC DISLOCATION IS TO CONNECT THE U. K. TWO OTHER OVERSEAS MARKETS AND I THINK FOR THOSE WHO SAY WE DON'T NEED THIS WELL
I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT THEIR RIVAL ECONOMIC MODEL FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY IS IF WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE A TRADING NATION DEALING WITH GROWTH MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GO PLACES THE WAY THEY USED IT WE'VE GOT THE INTERNET HAVEN'T WE DIDN'T THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO INTERESTINGLY THERE'S NOT MUCH EVIDENCE THAT THOSE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IS REDUCING THE NEED FOR BUSINESS TRAVEL AND INDEED THE KIND OF
SERVICES THAT WE DELIVER AROUND THE WORLD DEPEND MORE ON FACE TO FACE COMMUNICATION THAN TYPICALLY DOES MANUFACTURING SO PEOPLE WHO ARE TRADING WITH SERVICES DEALING WITH LEGAL CONTRACTS ETCETERA FINANCIAL MARKETS THEY DO NEED TO WORK FACE TO FACE AND STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE OVERSEAS STUDENTS NEED TO COME HERE ACTUALLY TO STUDY AND THEN WRITE LIKE TEN SECONDS SELL ME WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE BUILT
# I THINK THAT IF A NEW PRIME MINISTER MADE A DECISION QUICKLY THE THING COULD BE OPEN BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX TWENTY TWENTY SIX WILL SEE YOU THEN OH DAVIS THANK YOU BUT YOU'LL STILL BE HERE AT HER DOWN INTO TWENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS EXTENSIVE COVERAGE OF COURSE OF MICHAEL GOES ENTRIES TORY
LEADERSHIP RACE AT THE EXPENSE OF BORIS JOHNSON WHAT THE DAILY TELEGRAPH TERMS THE MOST SPECTACULAR POLITICAL ASSASSINATION IN A GENERATION WITH A SERVANT BRAISES MISTER JOHNSON'S CONTRIBUTION OF BRITISH POLITICAL LIFE HISTORY WILL REMEMBER HIM IN THE COUNTRY WILL ONE DAY THANK HIM FOR LEAD IN BRITAIN OUT OF THE E.U. IT SAYS IT SAYS IT DOUBTS THE BRICKS IT CAMPAIGN WOULD HAVE BEEN WON WITHOUT HIM SAME ACHIEVEMENT IS GROUNDS FOR A VERY DIFFERENT VERDICT IN THE DAILY MIRROR JUSTICE SENSE HEADLINE IT DESCRIBES BORIS JOHNSON AS A CHISELLING SELFISH LITTLE COWARD
WHO BETRAYED BRITAIN THE MIRROR ALSO QUOTES AN UNNAMED CONSERVATIVE HAS IT'S POSSIBLE AND EVEN BLUNTER ASSESSMENT THERE'S POETIC JUSTICE IN HIM BEING SHAFT THE GARDAI AS WELL MANY PAPERS DENOTED YESTERDAY'S EVENTS HAVE LEFT THERESA MAY THE CLEAR FAVOURITE TO SUCCEED DAVID CAMERON IT REPORT SHE HAS THE PUBLIC SUPPORT OF MORE THAN SEVENTY M.P.S MANY MORE THAN ANY OF HER RIVALS ONE OF THEM TERESA COFFEE WRITES IN THE EYE THAT MISSUS MAY HAS THE RIGHT QUALITIES TO PROVIDE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN THESE UNCERTAIN
IT'S AN ENDORSEMENT ECHOED BY THE DAILY MAIL WHICH DECLARES ON ITS FRONT PAGE IT MUST BE TERESA SENSED THE NATURE OF MY GOES ENTRY INTO THE LEADERSHIP CONTEST AS RACE QUESTION MARKS OVER THE QUALITIES OF CONSISTENCY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS THAT HIS WHO TO BEEN ADMIRED FOR SOLID AND STEADY HAND ON THE TILLER AS WHAT'S NEEDED THE MILK INCLUDES WHICH IT SAYS ONLY MISSUS MAY WELL PROVIDE TIMES OFFERS A MORE GENEROUS INTERPRETATION OF MY GIRLS' ACTIONS HIS DECISION TO TURN ON BORIS JOHNSON WAS IT CONCEDES RAW AND PERSONAL BUT WAS ALSO RIGHT DEMOCRACY IS BRUTAL
# THAT'S WHY TYRANTS FEAR IT FINANCIAL TIMES MEANWHILE FOCUSES ON ANOTHER POST BREAKS AT DEVELOPMENT COMMENTS FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR MARK CARNEY THAT THE U.K. IS FACING ECONOMIC POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER MY ONLY WORN THAT PEOPLE NEEDED A FIXED POINT BY WHICH TO NAVIGATE IN ORDER TO EMERGE FROM THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY WAS THE F. T. SAYS A SWIPE AT THE POLITICAL DISARRAY IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE REFERENDUM VOTE
# WE'RE AT THE SUMMER HOLIDAY SEASON UPON US THE TELEGRAPH REPORTS AN INCREASE IN SKIN CANCER AMONG OLDER PEOPLE WHICH HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISE OF PACKAGE HOLIDAYS CANCER RESEARCH DATA SHOWS TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE OVER FIFTY FIVE ARE DIAGNOSED WITH MELANOMA EVERY YEAR UP FROM JUST OVER THREE THOUSAND IN THE MID NINETIES THEY PER SAYS THE SUN SEA AND SANGRIA GENERATION ARE PAYING THE PRICE OF NOT TAKING PROPER PRECAUTIONS IN THE ERA OF CHEAP FOREIGN HOLIDAYS AND FINALLY BALDY TARBY DEATH IS STUFFY
# NOT OF ABUSE BEING THROWN AROUND TODAY BY POLITICAL YET THAT BE RATHER MILD ACTUALLY NO THEY ARE AS THE MIRROR REPORTER NAMES REJECTED BY DISNEY FOR THE SEVEN DWARFS IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THE PAPER PUBLISHES ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE DISCARDED WHICH WENT ON DISPLAY YESTERDAY AFTER BEING AUCTIONED OFF THE AUCTIONEER TELLS THE SUN IT WAS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST THAT THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE FINAL CUT THEIR NAMES WOULDN'T HAVE OFFENDED SENSIBILITIES IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES SHE SAYS BUT IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT STORY NOW
# THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT A TESSLER CAR USING THE SO CALLED AUTO PILOT FEATURE HAS CRASHED INTO A LORRY IN AMERICA LOOKS AS IF IT'S SIMPLY FAILED TO DETECT THAT THE LORRY WAS THERE AND THE DRIVER OF THE CAR WAS KILLED WAS A PILOT IS NOT FULL AUTOMATION BUT IT DOES INVOLVE THE CAR CHANGING LANES AND CHANGING SPEED AS WELL TO AVOID CRASHES AS I DISCOVERED JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN I DROVE TESSLER ON AUTO PILOT ON THE M. FOUR
OH IT'S A REALLY STRANGE FEELING BECAUSE THE WHEEL IS NOW MOVING I'VE GOT MY HANDS ON IT I HASTEN TO ADD BUT THE WHEELERS MOVING
IT'S QUITE A STRONG PAUL IT'S DOING WHAT IT THINKS WHAT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP US RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LANE AND I'M ACTUALLY DOING AT THE MOMENT NOTHING
WHICH IS A STRANGE STRANGE FEELING BECAUSE WE ARE DOING WELL WE WERE DOING SIXTY WHEN ADDING FIFTY
NO SAKE IS ON THE LINE IS CO DIRECTOR OF THE FOUNDATION FOR RESPONSIBLE ROBOTICS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND WHAT TESSLER SAYS THAT THIS WAS A WHITE TRAILER BY TRAIN I THINK THEM IN AN ARTICULATED LORRY AGAINST A BRIGHT SKY AND THAT'S WHAT WENT WRONG YES I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT EXPLANATION BECAUSE THAT WOULD AFFECT THE CAMERA OF COURSE BUT THERE IS A RADAR IN THE FRONT AS WELL AND ULTRASONIC SENSORS ULTRASONIC SENSORS SEND OUT A LITTLE CHEAP HAVE SIGNED AND THEN
DETERMINE HOW LONG IT TAKES THAT SAINT COME BACK AND CAN TELL YOU DISTANCES SO IT SHOULDN'T BE AFFECTED BY WHITE OR LIGHT AT ALL SO THIS IS A MORE PROFOUND PROBLEM POTENTIALLY THAN JUST A MALFUNCTIONING CAMP YEAH OH YES YES MUCH MORE BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO ALL THE REPORT SAID THAT IT WAS A HIGH TRAILER AND I THINK THAT MAYBE WITH THE SENSORS ARE A POINTING FAIRLY OR VERY LOW CARS FOR THE SENSORS ARE POINTING VERY LOW AND IT DIDN'T DETECT ANYTHING UNTIL THE WINDSCREEN SMASHED INTO THE TRAILER
BUT REALLY THE CENTURIES SHOULD BE POINTING UPWARDS AS WELL I MEAN ENGINEERS LAST YEAR TALKED ABOUT THE TEST HERSELF DRIVING CAR NOT SELF DRIVING THE AUTO PILOT CAR AND COMPLAINED THAT UNLIKE THE MERCEDES THEY WERE ACTUALLY BLIND SPOTS IN THE CENTURY WHAT TESSLER SAYS THE FIRST KNOWN FOR TALENT AND JUST OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION MILES WHERE AUTO PILOT WAS ACTIVATED
YES I MEAN THAT'S QUITE THAT'S QUITE GOOD BECAUSE SIXTY FOUR MILLION MILES I BELIEVE IS THE WORLD AVERAGE FOR FOR TOWER TEA'S STILL DOING BETTER I THINK SO I MEAN IT'S HARD TO KNOW I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH COS PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY HOLDING THE STEERING WHEEL THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TRUST BUT IT BUT IT IS CONCERNING AT WHAT THEY ARE WHAT THEIR REQUIRING THE
DRIVER TO DO A DRIVER IN INVERTED COMMAS AND I JUST WONDER PSYCHOLOGICALLY WERE THAT IT SETS BACK THE BUSINESS OF GETTING US ALL TO FEEL THAT THIS IS THE WAY TO GO
WELL HE'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO HELP AT ALL THEY HAVEN'T THEY HAVEN'T KILLED ANY PEOPLE ON THE ROAD THAT WOULD BE THE REALLY BIG ONE BUT I THINK THAT WE MIGHT SEE MORE OF THESE ACTIONS THE THING IS THAT THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AT LOTS OF CLAIMS ALL THE TIME IT'S LIKE A LITTLE MEAN SAYING THESE ARE GOING TO SAVE LIVES ON THE ROAD AND I BELIEVE THAT EVENTUALLY SELF DRIVING TECHNOLOGY WILL SAVE LIVES IN THE ROAD WHEN WE GET SENTRIES ON THE ROAD CONNECTED AND ALL THE CARS ARE LIKE THIS
BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE FOR THIS REALLY APART FROM THE FACT THAT ONE OR TWO HOW MANY CARS THEY'VE GOT CAN DRAPE THESE KIND OF DISTANCES BUT I DIDN'T GET THE POINT IS IT IT PROBABLY WILL SAVE SOME LIVES BUT IT MIGHT WELL COST OTHERS AND INNIT AND IT'S HOW YOU COULD COME UP WITH THE EQUATION THAT MAKES THAT ACCEPTANCE
YES THAT'S RIGHT BUT I IT'S ALSO REALLY IT'S ABOUT PUBLIC TRUST AND THIS IS JUST ONE ACCIDENT BUT AFTER A FEW MORE THEN I THINK THE PUBLIC WOULD ABANDON EVEN IF YOU GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT YES BECAUSE EVEN IF THE TECHNOLOGY DOES A LITTLE BETTER AT THEM THAN THE HUMAN DRIVER I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE PUBLIC TODAY BUT COULD YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL LOSE TRUST VERY QUICKLY IF IF THERE ARE FEW ACCIDENTS MUCH MORE THAN THEY WOULD WITH A HUMAN
# NO SHARKEY CO DIRECTOR OF THE FOUNDATION FOR RESPONSIBLE ROBOTIC THANKS THANK YOU FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING TO MARK THE SOMME ANNIVERSARY THE POET MICHAEL SIMMONS ROBERTS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
PAUL FOSSIL IN HIS BOOK THE GREAT WAR AND MODERN MEMORY CONJURES A FARMHOUSE IN PICARDY HOURS BEFORE THE SOMME ATTACK WHERE MEN FROM THE KING'S OWN YORKSHIRE LIGHT INFANTRY STOOD WITH GLASSES RAISED A BARRAGE OF SHELLS WAS REACHING ITS CRESCENDO SO INTENSE IT COULD BE HEARD IN ENGLAND IT WAS MEANT TO DESTROY THE GERMAN DEFENCES AND CLEAR A PATH FOR THE SOMME ADVANCE
THE COMMANDER GAVE A TOAST GENTLEMEN WHEN THE BARRAGE LIFTS AND THEY DRAIN THEIR GLASSES
WITHIN A DAY OF THAT ONE BATTALION OF EIGHT HUNDRED MEN MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED LAY DEAD ON THE BATTLEFIELD THE BOMBARDMENT FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INGENUITY OF GERMAN DEFENSIVE TUNNELS
WHEN THE BARRAGE LIFTS WAS A TOAST TO COURAGE BUT ALSO A PRAYER YOU FIND YOURSELF WANTING TO FINISH THE SENTENCE FOR THEM WHEN THE BARRAGE LEFT MAY YOU LIVE TO SEE YOUR FAMILIES AGAIN
BUT WITHIN A DAY THAT TOAST FALLS INTO SELF MOCKERY WHEN THE BARRAGE LEFTS YOU WILL BE CUT DOWN IT BECOMES A PROPHECY
FOR DECADES AFTER EVERY FIRST OF JULY AN ANONYMOUS MESSAGE WAS POSTED IN THE TIMES IN THE LAW I AM COLUMN SAYING GENTLEMEN WHEN THE BARRAGE LIFTS AND OFFICERS OFF THE CUFF TOAST TURNED FROM GRIM PROPHECY TO A MEMORIAL A SINGLE LINE ELEGY
THE FRENCH CHRISTIAN MYSTIC SEEM ON TOLD A STORY OF PRISONERS IN ADJOINING CELLS COMMUNICATING MY KNOCKING ON THE WALL SO THE WALL IS BOTH WHAT SEPARATES THEM AND THEIR ONLY MEANS OF CONTACT EVERY SEPARATION SHE SAYS IS A LINK BETWEEN CREATOR AND CREATED BETWEEN US
OUR SOMME COMMEMORATIONS WILL SOON BE FINISHED TIDIED UP STORIES LIKE THAT TOAST IN THE PICARDY FARMHOUSE WILL RECEDE INTO THE DISTANCE THE SEPARATION OF HISTORY IS STARK WE ARE NOT FOR THEM BUT WE ARE LIKE THEM AND A STORY A LINE FROM A POEM CAN BE A MEANS OF CONTACT
ONE OF THE GREAT POETS OF THE SOMME DAVID JONES DESCRIBES IN HIS EPIC IN PARENTHESIS A WOUNDED SOLDIER STRUGGLING FOR COVER IT'S DIFFICULT WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE RIFLE HE WRITES LEAVE IT UNDER THE OAK LEAVE IT FOR A SALVAGE BLOKE LET IT LIE BRUISED FOR A MONUMENT LEAVE IT FOR A COOK'S TOURISTS TO THE DEVASTATED AREAS
EVEN AS BATTLE RAGED THE POET WAS IMAGINING PEOPLE LIKE US IN THE FUTURE TOURING BATTLEFIELDS OUR SEPARATION HAD ALREADY BEGUN HOW QUICKLY THE SPARK FALTERS AND HISTORY FALLS BACK INTO MYTH
BUT THE POEMS OF JOAN'S WILFRED OWEN ISAAC ROSENBERG STILL HOLD THE VOLTAGE TO CONNECT US HOWEVER BRIEFLY WHEN THE BARRAGE LEFTS
# AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH MICHAEL SIMMONS ROBERTS THE TIME HERE'S TWELVE MINISTERING AND THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME WE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN MARKING THE COMMEMORATION OF THAT A TERRIBLE BATTLE THAT BEGAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO TODAY JAMES KNOTTY IS IN FRONT OF THE ARCHWAY A TEAR THERE VAL THE GREAT MEMORIAL JIM GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING JOHN ONCE AGAIN WE ARRIVED HERE IN THE DARK RATHER EARLY THIS MORNING THE FIRST BIRD SONG RISING FROM THE TREES AROUND THAT MEMORIAL COMMEMORATING THE MISSING OF THE SOMME
AND THEN THE LIGHT BROKE ON THE UNDULATING LANDSCAPE THAT STRETCHES HERE ALONG THE FRONT LINES AS THEY WERE ON THE FIRST OF JULY A HUNDRED YEARS AGO A VERY PEACEFUL SCENE GREEN AND GOLDEN MISTY
SWAYING FIELDS OF BARLEY EASY CONTOURS STRETCHING OUT TO A LOW HORIZON
BUT THIS CORNER OF FRANCE BECAME A CAULDRON OF HORROR WHEN THAT BATTLE BEGAN AT HALF PAST SEVEN THERE ARE SO MANY MEMORIES THE JOURNALIST SIMON HEIFER
HE'S THE SON OF A SOMME VETERAN HIS FATHER WAS IN HIS SIXTIES WHEN SIMON WAS BORN AND HE HAS THE DIARIES OF SIGNALLER JAMES HEIFER WHO SIGNED UP FOR THE CAMBRIDGESHIRE REGIMENT WHEN HE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN
FAKING HIS AGE TO GET TO FRANCE HIS SON SIMON REACH HIS WORKED
FIRST OF JULY NINETEEN SIXTEEN LOVELY DAY VERY HOT WE PASSED THE GRAVES OF MEN WHEN YOU FELL ON THE THIRTIETH IT WAS A SAD SIGHT TO SEE THE ROWS OF DEAD WAITING TO BE BURIED WITH A CHAPLAIN READING THE BURIAL SERVICE OVER THEM
WE HAVE THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH ARE ADVANCING IN THE SOMME ON THE THIRD OF JULY HE WRITES IN HIS DIARIES WERE THE BRITISH AND FRENCH ARE STILL MAKING GOOD PROGRESS IN THE SOMME WITH NINE VILLAGES TAKE THEM HE WAS A SIGNALLER AND SO HE WILL BE HERE IN ALL SORTS OF STUFF COMING IN THAT WERE MEANT FOR HIS COMMANDING OFFICERS AND WHICH WOULDN'T BE GENERALLY CIRCULATED TO THE MEN BUT HE OBVIOUSLY HEARD THAT AND I WAS VERY GOOD NEWS AND RECORDED IT BUT ONLY A FEW MILES SOUTH EAST THE LONG BATTLE IT LASTED ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE DAYS
STARTED WITH THE COSTLIEST ADVANCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE BRITISH ARMY WHEN PRISCILLA IS CHIEF HISTORIAN AT THE COMMONWEALTH WAR GRAVES COMMISSION WE ARE HERE NEXT TO THE ROMAN ROAD WHICH BISECTED THE BRITISH SECTOR AROUND THE VILLAGE OF LAP OR SO TO THE NORTH PLACES LIKE BUM ON HER MOUTH AND SAID THERE WERE HUGE LOSSES FOR VERY LITTLE GAIN
BUT IN THE SOUTH PLACES LIKE FREE COR MUM EH MUM ACTS TO THE BRITISH TROOPS AND ALSO MONTER BARN THE GERMAN FRONT LINE POSITIONS WERE ACTUALLY TAKEN PARTLY BECAUSE OF OVERWHELMING ARTILLERY AND CO OPERATION WITH THE FRENCH AND HERE WE'RE LOOKING DEEP INTO A CRATER THAT IS
IS ONE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY TO REMIND US OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DAYS AROUND THE BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE JUST REMIND US WHAT TOOK PLACE
IN THIS GREAT HALL WHERE WE'RE STANDING WHAT MIND HAD BEEN DUG UNDER THE GERMAN DEFENCES HERE THE LOCHNAGAR MINE IT WAS FILLED WITH EXPLOSIVES WHICH WERE DETONATED AT SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT A.M. TWO MINUTES BEFORE ZERO HOUR ON THE FIRST OF JULY IT WAS AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION COMPLETELY OBLITERATED THE THE GERMAN DEFENCES HERE BUT THEN VERY QUICKLY THEY COVER THEMSELVES AND THEY WERE PREPARED TO DEFEND DEFEND THIS THIS THIS AREA THERE WAS VERY FIERCE FIGHTING HERE WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE BRITISH SOLDIERS
I'VE COME A FEW MILES AWAY FROM THE CRATER TO ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GRAVEYARDS
ON THE SOMME FRONT LINE MAINTAINED BY THE COMMONWEALTH WAR GRAVES COMMISSION AND WALKING THROUGH A LITTLE COPSE OF TREES AND BUSHES AND THAT BIRD SINGING BUTTERFLIES AND BEES ALL AROUND AND HERE TUCKED AWAY FROM THE ROAD BEHIND THE TREES IS A SMALL CEMETERY THE DEVONSHIRE CEMETERY
TELL US THE STORY OF THIS PLACE THIS WAS THE BRITISH FRONT LINE ON THE FIRST OF JULY AND THIS IS THE AREA WHERE A BATTALION OF THE DEVONSHIRE REGIMENT LEFT TO ATTACK THE GERMAN LINES WHICH ARE NOT FAR AWAY FROM US
JUST OVER THE RISE TOWARDS MUM ACTS AND THEY MET WITH DISASTER THERE WAS A MACHINE GUN
ACROSS THE VALLEY AND OVER TWO HUNDRED MEN OF THE BATTALION LOST THEIR LIVES ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OF THEM WERE BROUGHT BACK HERE TO BE BURIED
IN WHAT HAD BEEN THEIR FRONT LINE FRENCH AS WE WALK ALONG THE THE HEADSTONES YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE THE MESSAGES WHICH HAVE BEEN INSCRIBED WHICH WAS SENT BY THE NEXT OF KIN OF THESE SOLDIERS TO THE WAR GRAVES COMMISSION AFTER THE END OF THE WAR THEIR FINAL WORDS
ON BEHALF OF THEIR LOVED ONES AND HERE WHERE WE'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE HEAD SORT OF PRIVATE STONEMAN HER WHO DIED ON THE FIRST OF JULY AGED JUST NINETEEN
AND HIS HIS PARENTS HAVE PROVIDED THIS INSCRIPTION TO HAVE TO LOVE I'M GOING TO PART IS THE SADDEST THING HAVE A PARENT'S HEART
TRAVELLING THROUGH THE VILLAGES AND THESE LOW LYING LAND YOU'RE NEVER FAR FROM A GRAVEYARD AND ANYONE CAN FIND HERE A REMINDER OF HOME NEAR LAB WHAT CEL I CAME ACROSS A POIGNANT PLOT WITH A COUPLE OF ROWS OF HEADSTONES MARKING THE PLACE WHERE MANY GORDON HIGHLANDERS FELL ON THE FIRST
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF SOLEMNITY SURROUNDING THESE COMMEMORATIONS
BUT MANY HUMAN TOUCHES AS WELL LIKE THIS LONDON BUS THAT SAW SERVICE ON THE FRONT AND HAS BEEN BROUGHT BACK HERE FOR THE CENTENARY
SO I'M JUST GETTING ON THIS NUMBER NINE BUS AND GOING UP THE STAIRS A SORT OF OUTER STAIR THAT TAKES IT TO THE OPEN TOP DECK WOULD HAVE BEEN RED AND CREAM WHEN IT ARRIVED HERE OF COURSE THEN IT'S PAINTED KHAKI NOW IT WAS A NUMBER NINE BUS RUNNING ALL THE WAY FROM LIVERPOOL STREET TO BARNES IN LONDON
COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO TRANSPORT THE INJURED IT COULD HAVE BEEN A PIGEON LOFT BECAUSE THEY SENT MESSAGES HOME BY CARRIER PIGEONS OR IT COULD'VE SIMPLY TRANSVERSE SOLDIERS FROM ONE VILLAGE TO ANOTHER AND AS I LOOK ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE HERE I CAN SEE THAT THE ROUTES THEY TOOK TO MOVE FROM ONE VILLAGE TO ANOTHER BEHIND THE LINES HERE THIRD OF SEPTEMBER NINETEEN SIXTEEN
THE VALLEY AND TRENCHES WERE HIDDEN BY CLOUDS OF SMOKE THROUGH WHICH IF YOU LOOK INTO THE RIGHT ALBERT COULD BE SEEN WITH IT SHATTERED TOWERS LOOMING FAINTLY ABOVE THE SMOKE
IT WAS A SPLENDID BUT YET AWFUL SIGHT WHEN YOU THINK OF THEIR LIVES TO BE LOST AND THIS BLOODY CONFLICT THROUGH A COUNTRY'S GREED FOR TERRITORY MEMORY
FIXED BY THE MEMORIAL AT THE MENIN GATE THE PERFECTLY KEPT CEMETERIES WERE THIRD INDIVIDUAL INSCRIPTIONS
I SPOKE TO PROFESSOR SIR HUGH ON MILITARY HISTORIAN AND PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT SAINT ANDREWS UNIVERSITY ABOUT HOW OUR VIEW OF THE GREAT WAR HAD CHANGED DOWN THE YEARS IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES I WAS TEACHING THE WERE WORK CAMBRIDGE STUDENT CAME IN AND SHE WON'T
IT'S REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY AND WE'VE FIXED UP A PIPER TO PLAY FOR THE FOREST TO BUGLER TO PAY THE LAST POST AND I SAID THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT YOU KNOW WHERE'S ALL THIS COME FROM BECAUSE I BELONG TO A GENERATION OF THE SIXTIES WAS MOVING AWAY FROM THIS AT THE STUDENT GENERATION THEN SAID TO THEIR GRANDFATHER'S THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS YOU SHOULD NEVER FOUGHT THIS WAR AND WE WERE MOVING
BACK I THINK FROM THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES SO IT PRE DATES THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN I MEAN IT WOULD BE EASY NOW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO SAY ONE OF THE REASONS WE PUT A LOT OF WEIGHT ON THIS IN THIS IDEA OF SOLDIERS AS VICTIMS OF A GOVERNMENT THAT'S NOT TERRIBLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT'S DOING ALL THAT CLEARLY PLAYS TO US NOW
AND SO IT CARRIES THAT WEEK TODAY BUT THIS PREDATED THAT AND I FIND IT VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE TWENTY NINTH OF SEPTEMBER NINETEEN SIXTEEN WAS A SMASH WE WERE BLOWN BACK DEAFENED AND CHOKING I THOUGHT MY HEART WAS NEVER GOING TO START AGAIN MY RIGHT HAND WAS BADLY BURNED THE FAT BURNING ON MY FINGERS I WENT MAD
THE PAIN WAS AWFUL HE RECORDED THIS A FEW WEEKS LATER IN LEEDS INFIRMARY WERE SURGEONS MANAGED TO SAVE HIS RIGHT HAND I STILL THINK THAT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WHEN HE WENT TO THOSE REUNIONS AND HE REMEMBERED THE PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T BE THERE MEN WHO WERE WERE FOR EVER YOUNG
THEY WERE YOUNG AS YOU'RE REMINDED IN EVERY CEMETERY HERE THE GRAVESTONES STRETCHING ACROSS THE SLOPES LIKE A WELL DRILLED PARADE IN WHITE STONE IN THREE HOURS THE FORMAL COMMEMORATION BEGINS ON THE SPOT AT THE GREAT MEMORIAL ARCH THAT DOMINATES THE LANDSCAPE
BUT AFTER THE DIGNITARIES AND THE SOLDIERS HAD LEFT THIS PLACE WILL STILL BE DIFFERENT SOMEHOW UNTOUCHED BY THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD THE FIELDS THEMSELVES A LIVING MEMORIAL
# I WILL BE HEARING MORE FROM JIM IN NORTHERN FRANCE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME TIME NOW THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THE WEATHER AND HERE'S PETER GIVES FISHERMAN'S JUSTIN OR YOU MIGHT FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE BUT DUMAS ACTUALLY A WARMER THAN AVERAGE MONTH ACROSS THE U.K. AS A WHOLE ARE DEFINITELY BELOW AVERAGE TEMPERATURES SO FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS TODAY WERE STARTING ON A CLOUDY NOTE ACROSS SOUTH WEST ENGLAND AND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND A BIT OF RAIN IN THE AIR AS WELL THAT WILL LINGER ON ACROSS KENT AND SUSSEX UNTIL WELL INTO THE LATTER PART OF THE AFTERNOON BUT ELSEWHERE
IT SHOULD BRIGHTEN UP QUITE NICELY A FEW SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH JUST THE CHANCE OF THE ODD SHOWER ONE OR TWO SHOWERS AS WELL FOR WALES THE MIDLANDS AND EASTERN ENGLAND CLOUDY AT THE MOMENT BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG I DON'T THINK TO BRIGHTEN UP SO SOME REASONABLE SPELLS OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE SECOND PART OF THE DAY BUT THE CHANCE OF ONE OR TWO SHOWERS AND SOME OF THOSE ON THE HEAVY SIDE ACROSS NORTH WALES AND THE MIDLANDS THIS AFTERNOON
MOST SHOWERS WILL BE ACROSS ALL OF NORTHERN ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND TODAY WE STILL HAVE TO LOSE SOME PERSISTENT RAIN FROM ABERDEENSHIRE BUT THAT WILL GO BEFORE TOO LONG AND THEN IT REALLY IS A MIX OF SUNNY SPELLS AND THEIR BLUSTERY SHOWERS THERE'LL BE SOME HAIL AND THUNDER IN THE MIX AS WELL PARTICULARLY THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON BUT EQUALLY SOME FAIRLY LENGTHY DRY SPELLS IN BETWEEN THE SHOWERS BUT EVERYWHERE WILL NOTICE A FAIRLY BRISK WEST OR NORTH WESTERLY WIND PICKING UP AND THAT'S GONNA KEEP TEMPERATURES
# ON THE LOW SIDE THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN AT BEST ACROSS NORTH WESTERN PARTS OF THE U.K. AROUND ABOUT NINETEEN OR TWENTY IN THE SOUTH EAST AND A SIMILAR THEME CONTINUING THROUGH THE WEEKEND THANK YOU VERY MUCH PETER JONATHAN DIMBLEBY IS NOW GOING TO TELL US ABOUT ANY QUESTIONS TONIGHT ON RADIO FOR ASSUMING YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT IT
NOT A CHANCE I THINK NOT WHAT A WEEK JOHN JUSTIN OFFERED HIS HEAD TO BREW TEA PERHAPS ONLY A LEWIS CARROLL OR WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE CAN MAKE SENSE OF THE SURREAL CHAOS NOW PASSES FOR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP ON BOTH SIDES WESTMINSTER IN THEIR ABSENCE A PANEL FOR ANY QUESTIONS WILL DOUBTLESS DO ITS BEST

# IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE FIRST OF JULY THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING MICHAEL GO TO SET OUT HIS CLAIM FOR THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP THE FRONT RUNNER THERESA MAY HAS WON THE BACKING OF TWO MORE CABINET MINISTERS A TWO MINUTE SILENCE HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM TO MARK THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE START OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME
# SCIENTISTS SAY THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER ABOVE ANTARCTICA IS SHRINKING AND THE WALES FOOTBALL TEAM FACE THEIR BIGGEST MATCH FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY WITH A SEMI FINAL PLACE IN THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP AT STAKE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO FOR MAKE THE FIRST SPEECH OF HIS CAMPAIGN TO BECOME THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER TODAY AFTER SENDING SHOCKWAVES THROUGH THE PARTY WITH HIS DECISION TO STAND
# MY ENTRY INTO THE CONTEST YESTERDAY PROMPTED BORIS JOHNSON THE BOOKMAKERS EARLY FAVOURITE TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE WOULD NOT BE A CANDIDATE THE NEW FRONT RUNNER THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY HAS WON THE BACKING OF MORE THAN SEVENTY TORY M.P.S THERE ARE THREE OTHER CONTENDERS ANDREA LET'S SOME STEPHEN CRABB AND LIAM FOX HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALEX FORSYTH
TODAY THE MAN MANY THOUGHT WOULD BE BACKING BORIS JOHNSON WOULD INSTEAD BRANDISHED HIS OWN LEADERSHIP CREDENTIALS SETTING OUT HIS VISION FOR BRITAIN TRYING TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON HIS POLICIES NOT THE POLITICAL TURMOIL HE'S CREATED
MICHAEL GO HAS ALREADY DEFENDED HIS DECISION TO STAND FOR THE TORY LEADERSHIP SAYING HIS LONG TERM ALLY BORIS JOHNSON COULDN'T UNITE THE PARTY FOR MY OWN ACTIONS HAVE CREATED ENORMOUS DIVISION SOME TORY M.P.S ARE SO ANGERED BY WHAT THEY SEE AS HIS TREACHEROUS TACTICS THERE SUPPORTING HIS RIVALS INCLUDING THERESA MAY
AFTER A CALM START TO THE HOME SECRETARY'S CAMPAIGN A STARK CONTRAST TO MY GOOSE THE DAILY MAIL NEWSPAPER HAS GIVEN HER IT'S BACKING AS HAVE TWO FURTHER CABINET MINISTERS MICHAEL FALLON AND PATRICK MCLOUGHLIN BUT THIS RACE HAS ONLY JUST STARTED THERE ARE FIVE PLAYERS ON THE FIELD AND A VERY BIG PRIZE EXPECT THEIR FIGHT TO STAY FIERCE
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CANDIDATE LIAM FOX HAS CRITICISED EUROPE'S TOP TRADE OFFICIAL AFTER SHE SAID THE U.K. COULD NOT BEGIN NEGOTIATING A NEW BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION UNTIL IT HAD LEFT THE E. USE TRADE COMMISSIONER CECILIA SAID THAT WOULD BE THE CASE EVEN IF IT HURT THE ECONOMIES OF THE REMAINING MEMBERS DOCTOR FOX TOLD US SUCH RULES WERE NONSENSE
HOW BIZARRE OR HOW STUPID IS THAT HAVE A POSITION WHERE YOUR RULES PRECLUDE A NEGOTIATION TO THE EXTENT THAT WOULD HARM ALL THE E.U. ECONOMY SO WHAT WE NEED TO GET NOW IS A POSITION WHERE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TALKS TO THE ELECTED GOVERNMENTS ACROSS EUROPE AND SAYS THE POSITION OF THE COMMISSION IS PREPOSTEROUS IT WILL HARM ALL EUROPEAN ECONOMIES IF THAT IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE IT IS IN NOBODY'S INTEREST
# THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL WILL SET OUT LABOUR'S VIEW OF THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE REFERENDUM RESULT IN A SPEECH IN LONDON THIS MORNING AMID CONTINUING PRESSURE ON JEREMY CORBIN TO RESIGN DOZENS OF M.P.S HAVE QUIT LABOUR'S FRONT BENCH TEAM IN AN ATTEMPT TO FORCE MISTER CORBIN TO STEP DOWN SOURCES SAY SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE JOINED THE PARTY IN THE PAST WEEK BUT IT'S NOT KNOWN IF THEY SUPPORT MISTER CORBIN OR WANT TO SEE HIM REMOVED OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON REPORTS
THE DECISION OF JEREMY CORBIN'S ALLY THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MACDONALD TO GIVE A SPEECH THIS MORNING IS ITSELF AN ACT OF DEFIANCE AS THE CLAMOUR FOR MISTER CORBIN'S RESIGNATION CRANKS UP FROM DEAFENING TO EARS SPLITTING A MAJORITY OF LABOUR MEMBERS OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT'S HAVE NOW SIGNED A LETTER CALLING FOR JEREMY CORBIN TO GO AND SUCH AS THE POVERTY OF HIS SUPPORT AT WESTMINSTER THERE ARE CURRENTLY SIXTY SEVEN SHADOW MINISTERIAL POSTS UNFILLED
SENIOR M.P.S ANGELA EAGLE AND OWEN SMITH HAS STILL TO DECIDE WHICH OF THEM HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF BEATING JEREMY CORBIN IN A LEADERSHIP CONTEST IF HE DOESN'T GIVE UP
THE SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY EMILY THORNBERRY HAS APOLOGISED TO THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR FOR ANY OFFENCE CAUSED BY MISTER CORBIN YESTERDAY AS LABOUR PUBLISHED ITS INQUIRY INTO ANTI SEMITE ISM MY JEWISH PEOPLE WERE NO MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF ISRAEL THAN MUSLIMS WERE FOR SELF STYLED ISLAMIC STATES LABOUR SOURCE SAID THE AMBASSADOR HAD NO ISSUE WITH MISTER CORBIN'S REMARKS AND DID NOT BELIEVE HE'D BEEN COMPARING ISRAEL TOO
# COMMEMORATIONS ARE BEING HELD TO MARK THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE START OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME MORE THAN A MILLION SOLDIERS WERE KILLED OR INJURED DURING FIGHTING THAT LASTED UNTIL NOVEMBER NINETEEN SIXTEEN IN THE U.K. A TWO MINUTE SILENCE HAS BEEN OBSERVED LATER SERVICES WILL BE HELD ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN THE FRENCH TOWN WHERE THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE AND DAVID CAMERON ARE AMONG THOSE WHO WILL ATTEND A CEREMONY OF REMEMBRANCE A CORRESPONDENT PETER HUNT IS AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY WHERE A VIGIL WAS HELD LAST NIGHT
THIS WAS A MOMENT FOR A PRE OCCUPIED NATION TO PAUSE AND REMEMBER THE PAST SACRIFICE OF SO MANY GUNS FROM THE FIRST WORLD WAR WERE FIRED TO EVOKE THE WEEK LONG BOMBARDMENT THAT WAS INFLICTED ON THE GERMANS BEFORE JULY THE FIRST IT WAS MEANT TO WEAKEN THEM IT FAIL
AFTER THE TWO MINUTES' SILENCE WHISTLES WERE BLUE AS THEY WERE A CENTURY AGO WHEN THEY SENT SO MANY MEN OUT OF THEIR TRENCHES OVER THE TOP AND TOWARDS THEIR DEATHS
AT LAST NIGHT'S VISUAL THE BISHOP OF LONDON RICHARD CHARTERS TOLD A CONGREGATION IN A COUNTRY REFASHIONING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT THE LEGACY OF THE SONG SHOULD BE THAT PEOPLE WORK FOR RECONCILIATION AND REJECT THOSE WOULD STIR UP HATRED AND DIVISION
# RESEARCHERS SAY THEY HAVE THE FIRST CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER OVER THE ANTARCTIC HAS BEGUN TO SHRINK AS STUDY FOUND THAT IT WAS ONE AND A HALF MILLION SQUARE MILES SMALLER THAN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY AN AREA ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF INDIA THE CHEMICALS WHICH CAUSE THE PROBLEM C.F.C.S WERE BANNED IN MOST COUNTRIES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ANYA SMITH FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS WHO HELPED WITH THE RESEARCH TOLD US SHE EXPECTED THE WHOLE TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE IN SIZE
EVENTUALLY IT WILL DISAPPEAR AND WE CAN ALSO ESTIMATED BY WERE TIMED WHAT HAPPENED AT THE SINK THIS CAN HAPPEN BY MID CENTURY SAW TWO THOUSAND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY SO YES EVENTUALLY THEY CLOSE
# THE U.S. AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING THE FIRST KNOWN FATAL ACCIDENT INVOLVING A CAR BEING DRIVEN ON AUTO PILOT THE COLLISION IN FLORIDA IN MAY INVOLVED A TESSLER ELECTRIC CAR WHICH IS FITTED WITH TECHNOLOGY ALLOWING IT TO CHANGE LANES AUTOMATICALLY TESSLER SIR DRIVERS WERE WARNED ABOUT KEEPING THEIR HANDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL AT ALL TIMES EVEN WHEN THE AUTO PILOT WAS TURNED ON HERE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA TECHNOLOGY REPORTER DAVE LEE
FORTY YEAR OLD JOSHUA BROWN WAS KILLED WHEN THE TEARS THE CAR HE WAS DRIVING COLLIDED WITH A LORRY TESSLER SAID THE CAR FAILED TO SLOW DOWN AS IT DIDN'T SPOT THE WHITE TRAILER AGAINST THE BRIGHT SKY
U.S. REGULATORS ARE TO LOOK AT WHETHER THE AUTO PILOT FUNCTION COULD BE CONSIDERED AT FAULT FOR THE COLLISION THAT INVESTIGATION COULD LEAD TO A RECALL
DESCRIBED THE DEATH AS A TRAGIC LOSS BUT THE COMPANY'S STRESS THAT DRIVERS USING AUTO PILOT HAD TRAVELLED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION SAFE MILES TO DATE THE INCIDENT COULD POTENTIALLY BE THE FIRST DEATH ATTRIBUTED TO SELF DRIVING TECHNOLOGY AND COULD BE A SERIOUS BLOW AT A TIME AND REGULATORS ACROSS THE WORLD ARE CONSIDERING HOW TO SAFELY INTRODUCE THE IDEA TO PUBLIC ROADS
# THE MAN WHO HEADED THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONED INTO EXPANDING AIRPORT CAPACITY IN THE SOUTHEAST OF ENGLAND HAS SAID A DECISION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN SOON IN ORDER TO DISPEL THE NOTION THAT BRITAIN IS TURNING IN ON ITSELF IT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT NO DECISION WILL BE MADE UNTIL AT LEAST OCTOBER WHEN A NEW PRIME MINISTER WOULD BE IN PLACE SO HOWARD DAVIES WHO RECOMMENDED LAST JULY THAT HEATHROW SHOULD BE EXPANDED TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THE REFERENDUM RESULT MADE IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE DECISION WAS FINALLY TAKEN
UNDOUBTEDLY INTERNATIONALLY REGS IT IS BEING SEEN AS A SOMEWHAT INSULAR SIGN A SIGN OF BRITAIN TURNING IN ON ITSELF THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT THE ADVOCATES WANTED THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A BROADER TRADING RELATIONSHIP A COUNTRY THAT SEEKS OUT MARKETS IN THE GROWING PARTS OF THE WORLD IN ASIA ET-CETERA BUT I THINK A REAL SYMBOL OF OUR WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT WOULD BE A DECISION ON INCREASED AIRPORT CAPACITY
# A JUDGE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS ORDERED A NEW TRIAL FOR A MAN SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE FOR MURDER WHOSE CONVICTION WAS CALLED INTO QUESTION IN A POPULAR PODCAST AT THAT WAS JAILED SIXTEEN YEARS AGO FOR FILLING FOR KILLING A FORMER CLASSMATE HI MAINLY IN BALTIMORE THE PODCAST CALLED SERIAL ALSO BROADCAST ON RADIO FOUR EXTRA CAST OUT ON EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT HIS TRIAL ORDERING A NEW HEARING THE JUDGE SAID SYED'S LAWYER HAD OVERLOOKED EVIDENCE THAT COULD HAVE HELPED HIM
# THE WALES FOOTBALL TEAM PLAY THEIR BIGGEST GAME IN NEARLY SIXTY YEARS TONIGHT WHEN THEY TAKE ON BELGIUM AT THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP IN FRANCE THOUSANDS OF WELSH SUPPORTERS HAVE TRAVELLED TO LIL FOR THE QUARTER FINAL A CORRESPONDENT HELL GRIFFITH IS THERE TOO
AS THE ONLY HOME NATION LEFT IN EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN WALES NO THEY'VE ALREADY EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS NOW THEY FACE THE TEAM RANKED AS THE SECOND BEST IN THE WORLD DESPITE BEING THE UNDERDOGS WHALES CAN APPROACH THE GAME WITH BELCHER WAS SOME CONFIDENCE HAVING BEATEN THEM IN THEIR LAST ENCOUNTER TWELVE MONTHS AGO
THOUSANDS OF WELSH SUPPORTERS HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED IN LILLE HOPING TO SEE A PIECE OF SPORTING HISTORY THE NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WORLD CUP WALES TEAM WERE KNOCKED OUT BY BRAZIL AND A GOLD BY A YOUNG MAN CALLED PALAIS IF WALES WIN TONIGHT THEY WILL SURPASSED THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THEIR PREDECESSORS AND FIND THEMSELVES JUST A GAME AWAY FROM THE FINAL
# HOW A GROUP OF REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT IT IS ONE WEEK SINCE WE WOKE TO THE NEWS OF THIS COUNTRY HAD VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION A WEEK AGO ALMOST TO THE MINUTE SINCE DAVID CAMERON WALKED OUT OF THE DOOR OF NUMBER TEN TO ANNOUNCE HE WAS STANDING DOWN AS PRIME MINISTER A WEEK UP TURMOIL THAT MAY BE UNPRECEDENTED IN MODERN POLITICAL HISTORY THE LABOUR PARTY HE'S CONSUMED BY ITS OWN CIVIL WAR IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE TALK IS OF TREACHERY AT THE VERY HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE BATTLE TO SUCCEED MISTER CAMERA
BUT UNPRECEDENTED HASN'T POLITICS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT LONG PERIODS OF TEDIUM AND POLITICAL POINT SCORING INTERSPERSED WITH MOMENTS OF HIGH DRAMA IS THIS REALLY SO DIFFERENT THERE'S ONE MAN WHO'S BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE FOR FORTY SIX YEARS HE TELLS SOME OF THE GREAT OFFICES OF STATE CHANCELLOR HOME SECRETARY THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. KEN CLARKE AND I'LL BE TALKING TO HIM IN A MOMENT FIRST LET'S HEAR FROM SOME MEMBERS OF THE TORY PARTY THE PEOPLE WHO DECIDE WHO WILL BE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER HAWKINS HAS BEEN TO THE CONSERVATIVE HEARTLAND OF SURREY
STONES FROM THE LOCAL CONSERVATIVES HOW'RE YOU DOING HOW DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT TO VOTE TODAY VOTES ARE BEING SOUGHT HANDSHAKE AND CHARM DEPLOYED BUT THIS ISN'T WESTMINSTER
IT'S LEATHERHEAD WHERE THE LOCAL CONSERVATIVES ARE CONTESTING A DISTRICT COUNCIL BY ELECTION AND WE RELY ON YOUR SUPPORT AND IT'S THE SUPPORT OF TORY MEMBERS LIKE THESE THAT THE CANDIDATES TO BE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER WILL NEED IF THEY'RE TO WIN
SO WHEN THE ACTIVIST TAKE A BREAK IN THE PUB WHAT DO THEY SAY THEY WANT FROM A NEW PARTY LEAVE MY VIEWERS FIRMLY BEHIND THERESA MAY I THINK SHE'S GOT THE CREDENTIALS FOR THE JOB
SHE'S GOT A GRAVITY THERE DO IT AND IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO STAY IN THE POSITION OF HOME SECRETARY FOR SIX YEARS UNLESS YOU'RE GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO I THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE A SPECIAL CHARACTER TO BRING THE PARTY TOGETHER BRING THE NATION TOGETHER AND TO MANAGE ALL THOSE EGOS AND THAT'S A TASK THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY A WOMAN BOILS DOWN TO IT'S EITHER MAY OR ALL SOME THEY WOULD NOT BE MY CHOICE SHE'S DULL I'M LOOKING FOR
CHARISMATIC PEOPLE JOHNSON WAS CHARISMATIC BUT HE BECAME BUFFOONISH AT THE TIME WE DON'T LIKE THAT YOU'RE AFTER STRENGTH AREN'T YOU YES AND CONVICTION
AND DOMINANCE
THE SMACK PERHAPS A FIRM GOVERNMENT OR MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE NOT FAR FROM MICHAEL GOES CONSTITUENCY BUT AFTER COMING HERE FROM WESTMINSTER WHICH IS BOILING OVER WITH FURY ABOUT HIS ALLEGED TREACHERY WHAT'S STRIKING IS HOW CALM THEY ARE
AND HELP DISTANT THAT DRAMA SEEMS I DON'T THINK HE'S STABBED BORIS JOHNSON IN THE BACK I THINK HE IS PERFECTLY ENTITLED TO RUN FOR THE LEADERSHIP I THINK IS A LAUDABLE AMBITION I DON'T THINK WE'RE NOT A PARTY THAT DOESN'T LIKE TALL POPPIES THERE'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF
I HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE ON THE DOORSTEP TO GET ELECTED RIGHT DOWN TO EARTH AND ARE THEY TALKING TO YOU ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL
NO THEY'RE NOT TALKING THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ROADS AND SCHOOLS HAVE WE GOT A GOOD ENOUGH SCHOOL FOR OUR CHILDREN TO GO TO WHERE A PRACTICAL PARTY OF COURSE WE HAVE OUR IDEOLOGIES AND BROADLY SPEAKING WE BELIEVE IN SMALL GOVERNMENTS BUT REALLY AND TRULY WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS RUNNING THE COUNTRY PROPERLY
THAT WAS ROSS HAWKINS THERE WELL IN THE RESULT BY THE WAY OF THAT TETH LEATHERHEAD LOCAL BY ELECTION TALLY OF THE CONSERVATIVES LOST TO THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS AS I SAID KEN CLARKE IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TO UNPRECEDENTED MY ARSE TO ME WELL IT IS IN SOME WAYS AND I'VE SEEN SOME FAIRLY MEAN TAKING PART QUITE FREQUENTLY WAS RYE HOLBY AT ONE POINT BUT I'VE GIVEN THAT UP THE ONLY MAN HOW YOU EVER GIVEN UP YOU'VE BEEN A HOBBY OF RUNNING FOR LEADER RUNNING FOR LEADER OF EVERYBODY ELSE
BUT WE NEVER HAD ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS I THINK AND THAT NEVER HAD ONE SO IMPORTANT COS THE TROUBLE IS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST WE'VE GOT TO SELECT PRIME MINSTER AS QUICKLY AND SENSIBLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN THERE IS A REAL THREAT TO OUR ECONOMY UNTIL WE MAKE SOME PROGRESS WE NEED SOMEBODY IN OFFICE WHO CAN CARRY THE CONFIDENCE OF ALL HIS OR HER COLLEAGUES AND ACTUALLY MAKE SURE
WE REASSURE INVESTORS WE ENSURE BUSINESSES THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR ECONOMIC AND TRADING RELATIONSHIPS ARE GOING TO BE I'D BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED IF WE DON'T HAVE A RECEPTION IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WILL NEED A VERY GOOD PRIME MINISTER WHO KNOWS CLEARLY WHAT HE OR SHE WRITES TO DO AVOID THAT WHO IS THAT MIRACLE WORKER I HAVE NOT GOT CHOSEN BUT I'D SORT OF WE HAVE VIED DISLIKES
ALL RIGHT I THINK YOUR DISLIKES THEM IT'S ONLY BIG OVERNIGHT AS IT WERE BUT I DO THINK MICHAEL GO WOULD DO US ALL A FAVOUR IF WE WERE TO STAND NOW AND SPEED UP THE PROCESS BECAUSE I DO THINK ONE OF THE FIRST PRIORITIES FOR A LEADER OF A PARTY AND CERTAINLY FOR A PRIME MINISTER IS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE TRUST SEVA AS POSSIBLE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES
I DO IF I WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO PERSONALLY WAS APPALLED BY THE IDEA OF BORIS JOHNSON BEING PRIME MINISTER BUT I'M NOT FALLEN OUT WITH HIM PERSONALLY BUT IF I COULD GO WITH HER BELIEVES AS HE CLEARLY DOES THAT BORIS JOHNSON IS NOT FITTED TO BE PRIME MINISTER ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND PROPER THAT HE SHOULD SAY SO NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T
STAND FOR THE JOB BECAUSE AFTER ALL HE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT HE WAS THE MAN WHO WANTED BRETT'S IT ALL ALONG HEATH HE STOOD ON THAT TICKET DOES IT WEREN'T THERE NO HE'S STICKING TO HIS PRINCIPLES HE'S PERFECTLY ENTITLED TO FORMAT VIEW BUT I THINK IT'S NOT
ENCOURAGING THAT HE STOOD ON ALONGSIDE BORIS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN AS HIS RIGHT HAND MAN HE WAS PUBLICLY DECLARED TO BE HIS MANAGER HE NOW OBJECTS TO A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WHICH HE'D OBVIOUSLY SEEN AND IMPROVE GOT APPROVED OF THAT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WAS A BIG IMPROVEMENT TO THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WERE BEING SAID DURING THE CAMPAIGN I JUST THINK TOO I CANNOT THINK THAT GIVEN THAT WE DON'T WANT
YOU NEED TO ADD TO TRAGEDY TOO MUCH OF AN AIR OF FARCE AND FOR HIM TO EMERGE NOW AS THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING I'M NOW GOING TO REUNITE THE PARTY AND I HAVE A CLEAR VISION OF WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I THINK UNLIKELY I MEAN OTHER OTHER HIM ABOUT I GOT THE GUYS YOU SAID THAT YOU SAT IN CABINET DIDN'T YOU I THINK WITH THE WITH WITH MICHAEL GO GIRL YOU'VE GOT ON ALL RIGHT WITH IT YOU RESPECTED HIM ARE YOU SAYING HE ISN'T
SIMPLY NOT FITTED TO BE PRIME MINISTER I THINK IS PROBABLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DEPARTMENTAL MINISTER WE HAD I STRONGLY APPROVE THE BODY DOUBLE AND I WOULD STRONGLY APPROVED OF WHAT HE WAS STARTING TO DO AS JUST A SECRETARY I JUST THINK THAT THIS KIND OF PUBLIC PERFORMANCE AS SOMEONE SAID EARLIER IN YOUR PROGRAMME MORE SUITABLE FOR THE ELECTION OF THE STUDENT UNION THAN IT IS TO BE PRIME MINISTER OF
THIS COUNTRY AT A TIME OF GRAVE GRAVE POTENTIAL CRISIS ON THE OTHER HAND IF HE PUT PUT THE ELECTION ASIDE PUT THE EVENTS OF THESE LAST FEW DAYS ASIDE WHEN EVERYBODY HAS BEEN GETTING A BIT HYSTERICAL IF IT'S IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT MANY PEOPLE WILL SEE IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT MICHAEL GLUE COULD BECOME A SOLID DEPENDABLE PERHAPS EVEN GREAT PRIME MINISTER
SHOULD HE BE DISQUALIFIED ON THE BASIS OF WHAT HE HAS DONE IN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS I THINK YOU SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED IN THIS CONTEST AND I DO THINK WE OUGHT TO TURN AWAY FROM THESE PERSONALITY BATTLES AND ACTUALLY GET ALL RIDING CHEERY GET THE GET THE OTHER I DON'T THINK I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HEADLINES IS MUMMY SINGLING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO MOVE ONTO IS TO GET OUT OF THE CANDIDATES SOME CLEAR INDICATION OF HOW THEY PROPOSE TO HANDLE
REX IT HOW THEY CAN MINIMISE THE PROBLEMS BUSINESS MEN WILL BE APPALLED IF THE WHOLE THING JUST IS REDUCED TO THESE PERSONALITY SQUABBLES AND JEALOUSIES AND RIVALRIES AND ACTUALLY ALL THE CANDIDATES NOW NEED TO SET UP CAREFULLY THE BASIS UPON WHICH WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WITHOUT CAUSING DAMAGE TO OUR ECONOMY IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS
AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY WITHOUT MAKING COUNTRY POORER IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG THAT THE FACT THAT HE'S THE BIG SERIOUS QUESTION THAT IS BEING OBSCURED BY THE BIZARRE MANOEUVRINGS OF PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL GO AND YOUR COURSE DESPERATELY WANTED US TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE FACT HE'S NOW THERE IS NO FOR WANT OF A BETTER PHRASE SOFT BRICKS IT CANDIDATE LEFT FOR THE LEADERSHIP IS THERE BUT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE AN EARLY ELECTION THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A SECOND REFERENDUM
YOU'RE STUCK WITH IT WE ARE STUCK WITH IT BUT THE THE LEADER OR THE PRIME MINISTER HAS GOT ACTUALLY TO ADDRESS THERE'S SERIOUS PROBLEMS HE OR SHE WILL TAKE OVER AND YOU WILL FIND A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY I HOPE AND THE NEED TO THINK THROUGH MORE CAREFULLY
POLICY OR DESIRE TO LISTEN TO EXPERTS MICHAEL GO AND REJECT AT ONE POINT WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS MENTIONED WILL DESCEND ON THESE FOUR CANDIDATES I I HEARD LIAM FOX AN HOUR AGO AND YOUR PROGRAMME WITH THAT LIAM WAS TRYING TO ADDRESS WHAT
WE NOW DO I THINK HE WAS PROFOUNDLY WRONG HE APPEARS TO IMAGINE THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS THE SAME ACCESS TO EUROPEAN MARKETS AS BRITAIN DOES AT THE MOMENT IT DOESN'T THAT'S WHY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS KILLED WITH CANADA TOGETHER WITH JAPAN WAS TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION INCLUDING OURS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE
AND BUT THESE THINGS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THE PRIME MINISTER HAS GOT TO PUT TOGETHER A TEAM WHO ARE REALISTIC THE DANGER ALL RIGHT ELECTION IS THERE OR COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER IN SHOWING THAT THE PURITY OF BRECHT'S OTHERWISE AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO STAND UP TO THE COMMISSION HOW MUCH THEY DISLIKE IMMIGRANTS BUT THE MOMENT THEY THINK BEING PRIME MINISTER THEY ARE UNDER A DUTY TO START
THINKING RESPONSIBLY ABOUT THE LONG TERM FUTURE RIGHT DRUG THE EAR AT THE MOMENT THE FAVOURITE BY A MILE IS THERESA MAY SHE'S GOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT NOT LEAST AMONGST CABINET COLLEAGUES
DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD MAKE A GOOD PRIME MINISTER COULD YOU SEE YOURSELF SUPPORTING HER NO THE BRYMON IT SHE CERTAINLY POPPA RESIDENT OF HATTERSLEY PRAISED ME TO USE IT MEANS IT'S THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PHRASED CABLE OF BEING POPE SHE'S ONLY GOT ALL THE ABILITIES OBVIOUSLY THAT SHE'S IN THE RIGHT CLASS OF CONTENDER I WOULD LIKE TO YOU HAD TO SPELL OUT
CAREFULLY BUT CONSIDERED AND CAUTIOUS POLICY POSITION CAUTIOUS BECAUSE IT'S GOT TO BE NEGOTIATED AND THE REST OF EUROPE BRRR MEXLEY MOST BRITISH BUSINESS OR WOULD BE INVESTORS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT THE BRITISH ACTUALLY NOW WANT TO NEGOTIATE AND THOUGH THAT THE OPTION OF COURSE PREFER
IS THE JOINED THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AS NORWAY DID WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF NORWAY NEGOTIATED FOR ENTRY INTO THE E.U. AND THEN IT WAS REJECTED IN A REFERENDUM AND THE NORWEGIANS HAVE FOUND THAT WORKS VERY WELL TO THEIR ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE THE SOONER YOU DO THAT THE BETTER THEN OF COURSE YOU CAN WE'RE MORE INFLUENTIAL MORNING INTO THE EUROPEANS IN NORWAY WE CAN START ADDING ALL KINDS OF THINGS IF YOU THINK
THERE ARE THINGS YOU WANT TO NEGOTIATE THAT CAN BE KIND OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA PLUS FOR THE BRITISH ALL RIGHT YES OR NO ON THERESA MAY IN THE LAST FIGHT I'M NOT SETTLING FOR A LOT OF THE TIME WELL I'M GOING TO HOPING TO HEAR FROM ONE OR TWO OF THEM I'M NOT NOT DETAIL SHOULD THAT BE RECKLESS PARTICULARLY IF THEY ALL RIGHT MAKING FOOLISH ERROR WE TALK OVER THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS I SUSPECT
# THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT WE'RE MARKING THIS MORNING ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE START OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME AND JIM WHO HAS BEEN WITH HER THROUGHOUT THE MORNINGS THERE AGAIN ON THE SITE OF THE BATTLEFIELD NORTHERN FRANCE LOGAN
OH GOOD MORNING JUST IN THAT CROWDS ARE GATHERING HERE AT THE T. AT THE MEMORIAL AT THE HEART OF THE SOMME BATTLEFIELD WHERE THE COMMEMORATIVE EVENT BEGINS IN ABOUT THREE HOURS THE PRINCE OF WALES AND HIS TWO SONS WILL BE HERE THE PRIME MINISTER TOGETHER WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF FRANCE A FORMER PRESIDENT OF GERMANY ANOTHER DIGNITY AND DESPITE THE SOLEMNITY OF THE BAND OF THE WELSH GUARDS HAVE BEEN LIFTING SPIRITS HERE IT WAS THE CROWD A GUY THAT I THINK THEY'RE ABOUT TO PLAY AGAIN AND YOU MAY HEAR THEM IN THE BACKGROUND
EVERYONE HERE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL HEAR MUSIC AND POETRY AND PERHAPS OF THE CLOUDS LIFT SOME OLD BIPLANES FROM THE GREAT WAR WILL TAKE TO THE SKIES NOW THE FOUR YEARS OF COMMEMORATIONS OF THE GREAT WAR A DISTILLED HERE AT THIS SPOT BECAUSE JULY THE FIRST NINETEEN SIXTEEN SUMMED UP SO MUCH BUT CAME TO REPRESENT IT FOR GENERATIONS AFTERWARDS WITH ME HERE
BESIDE THE MEMORIAL IS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY JUSTIN WELBY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS GREAT LOOMING MEMORIAL
BY LUCK CHINS ON A SPOT WHERE THE BRITISH AND GERMAN TRENCHES FACED EACH OTHER REALLY VERY CLOSELY WHAT COMES TO YOUR MIND CATASTROPHIC POLITICAL FAILURE
THAT THIS WAS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN MISCALCULATED ACROSS EUROPE HERE IN THE U.K.
AND THE RESULT WAS WAS SIXTY THOUSAND NAMES ON THAT MEMORIAL AND HOW MANY MORE BESIDES
HOW SHOULD PEOPLE BRING TO BEAR THEIR FEELINGS
ABOUT THAT HORROR ABOUT THE UNIMAGINABLE NUMBERS PERHAPS TWO MILLION BY THE TIME WAS ALL OVER AND ALL THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED WHEN THEY THINK OF THAT DISTANT HORROR AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD AROUND THEM HOW SHOULD BE BRING ONE TO BET ON THE OTHER WHERE THEY THINK THERE'S THERE IS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY MEMORIAL THERE IS SOMETHING HERE
THE NOBILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT THAT OF WAS WILLING TO DO WHAT THESE PEOPLE DID WHAT THESE MEN DID
ON BOTH SIDES AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT
THE CASUALTIES ON THE GERMAN SIDE WERE EQUALLY HORRENDOUS AND THERE'S ALSO THAT SENSE THAT WE HAVE A PROFOUND RESPONSIBILITY TOO
AND FIND WAYS OF DISAGREEING WELL THAT AVOIDS US HAVING EVER TO BUILD MORE MEMORIALS LIKE THIS
SURELY AFTER ONE HUNDRED YEARS ALONGSIDE THE FEELINGS OF PRIDE THAT YOU ALLUDED TO AT THE WAY PEOPLE BEHAVED HE HAD BRAVELY LOYALLY WHATEVER UNIFORM THEY WERE WEARING BUT IT'S ANOTHER FEELING AT THIS JUNCTION ONE HUNDRED YEARS ON ISN'T THERE AND THAT HAS TO BE DESPAIR BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED WELL I THINK WE'VE LEARNED I THINK TO SPEND NOW
AMBER OBVIOUSLY YOU'D EXPECT ME TO YOU TO SAY THAT I HOPE IT IS SOMETHING THAT HE'S GIVEN US BY GOD
I QUOTED EARLIER A VERSE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT SAYS THE ETERNAL GOD IS YOUR REFUGE UNDERNEATH ARE THE EVERLASTING ARMS SPOKEN TO ARE PEOPLE INTO SPARE ANNEXE
THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND A WAY FORWARD THAT THE NOBILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT THAT THE ASPIRATIONS THAT WE HAVE FOR PEACE CAN BE MET
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG ETHICAL BASIS FOR DOING THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG SPIRITUAL BASIS WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE IN EVERY HUMAN BEING
THE REALITY OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT AND FIND WAYS FORWARD AND WITHOUT TOUCHING ON
DAY TO DAY POLITICS AND THIS IS NOT WHAT THE QUESTION'S MEANT TO IMPLY
THAT HIS LEADERSHIP REQUIRED ISN'T THAT OF OF STRENGTH AND WITH SOME INSPIRATIONAL QUALITY
THERE IS AT ALL TIMES AND PARTICULARLY IN IN THESE YEARS THERE IS A NEED FOR LEADERSHIP THAT IS INSPIRATIONAL THE HUGELY COURAGEOUS BUT MOST OF ALL THAT IS PROFOUNDLY WHY IT'S THAT CAN LISTEN AS WELL AS SPEAK AND PERHAPS WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN WAS MORE ABOUT SPEAKING THAN LISTENING
MEMORY IS CELEBRATED HERE IN IN STONE AND IN THE CEMETERIES THAT SPREAD ACROSS THIS LANDSCAPE FROM WHERE WE'RE SITTING
AND IT IS UNQUESTIONABLE THAT MORE PEOPLE COME HERE THAN EVER BEFORE I ASKED THIS QUESTION EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME TO HUGH ON THE MILITARY HISTORIAN WHY DO YOU THINK IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OR SO AND THIS HAPPENED BEFORE THE WAR IN IRAQ
PEOPLE BEGAN SOME HOPE BUT PARTICULAR YOUNGER GENERATION TO TAKE MORE INTEREST IN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
HERE ON THE SOMME PASSION DEAL THAN AT ALL THE OTHER PLACES IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND IT BECAME SOMEHOW CLOSER TO THE NATIONAL HEART IT SEEMS THAN IT HAD BEEN FORTY FIFTY YEARS EARLIER I ENTIRELY AGREE WITH YOU I WATCH THAT WHEN I WAS A PARISH PRIEST HAS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE CAME EVERY YEAR TO THE SERVICE ON REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY EVERY YEAR
I THINK I THINK THERE'S A DEEP SENSE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT THERE WAS THEN A CALL
WE NEED A VISION WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE BUILDING IN THIS WORLD WE NEED SOMETHING THAT'S MORE THAN MATERIAL
AS THEY HAVE THE AND I THINK PEOPLE SEE
THE SENSE OF WHY THEY'RE IN THIS WORLD AND WHAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE HOW THEY CAN MAKE THE WORLD BETTER
ARCHBISHOP ACCOMPANIED BY THE BAND OF THE WELSH GUARDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
# AND THAT WAS JIM OF COURSE IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND HERE'S JONATHAN WITH A SPOT AGAIN THEY'VE DONE BETTER THAN ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT CAN WALES NOW ACHIEVE A NEW FOOTBALL LANDMARK AND REACHED THE SEMI FINALS OF A MAJOR TOURNAMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME THEIR STAR MAN GARETH BALE HAVE DESCRIBED TONIGHT'S QUARTER FINAL AGAINST BELGIUM IN
YOU'RE A TWENTY SIXTEEN AS THE BIGGEST GAME OF THEIR LIVES LET'S HEAR WHAT THE FORMER WELSH PLAYER JOHN HARTSON THINKS YOU'LL BE THERE FOR THE B. B. C. GOOD MORNING JOHN GOOD MORNING HOW KEY IS GARETH BALE BECAUSE UNLIKE ENGLAND'S PLAYERS HERE PEAS TO APPEARS TO HAVE THRIVED AS THE TEAM'S FOCAL POINT AND GOAL SCORER IN THE TOURNAMENT
YES WHAT GARETH IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE GROUP AND THAT'S WHAT DO YOU NOT I KNOW INCREDIBLE PLAY BUT YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T SEE HIMSELF LIKE THAT THE GROUP SEE HIM AS YOU KNOW IS VERY MUCH PART OF THINGS AND YOU KNOW IS HE DOESN'T COME WITH A BIG ENTOURAGE AND A BIG EGO WORKS HARD FOR THE TEAM
AND HE'S GOT THREE GOALS IN THREE IN IN IN IN THIS TOURNAMENT SO FAR SO MASSIVELY IMPORTANT HE WAS REALLY REALLY VITAL IN THE QUALIFIERS AND IT'LL TAKE A BIG PERFORMANCE FROM GARETH OBVIOUSLY TO HELP US GET THROUGH BELGIUM TONIGHT YOU MENTION THERE ABOUT HIS PLACE WITHIN THE GROUP THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE POWER OF TEAM SPIRIT AT THIS TOURNAMENT HOW MEANINGFUL IS THAT AGAINST A TEAM BELGIUM RANKED SECOND IN THE WORLD THEY'RE GOOD AREN'T THEY
YES WE WERE BUT I HAVE TO BE OUR VERY BEST TO GET HER RESULTS I THINK SIMILAR TO THEIR PERFORMANCE THAT WE SHOWED AGAINST RUSSIA WE WEREN'T SO GOT TO GAUGE NORTHERN ISLAND BUT IT'S A SIGN OF A OF A OF A GOOD SIDE WHEN YOU DON'T PUT PLAY PARTICULARLY WELL BUT YOU CAN STILL GET THE RESULTS AND GO THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND SO BELGIUM AND AN EXTREMELY GOOD SIDE THAT THEY DID THEY COME OFF A GREAT VICTORY AGAINST HUNGRY FOR NIL I IN HOWZAT SEEMS TO BE BACK TO FORM
SO AS I SAID IT'S A GAME IT WAS A SEMI FINAL PLACE FOR THE WINNERS WE ARE UNBEATEN AGAINST BELGIUM AND OUR LAST THREE TIMES WE'VE PLAYED THEN WE BEAT THEM THIS TIME LAST YEAR IN CARDIFF SO THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T GO IN FAIRLY CONFIDENT AND THEREFORE JUST EXTENDING THAT POINT IF YOU'RE THE UNDERDOGS THE EXPECTATIONS IN A SENSE ARE QUITE LOW SO THEREFORE AGAIN THERE'S A CHANCE TO PUNCH ABOVE YOUR WEIGHT AND ACHIEVE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL
YEAH WE SEEM TO THRIVE ON THE UNDERDOG TAG WE WERE THE DOGS COMING IN COMING IN TO THE TOURNAMENT IN THE GROUP STAGES WE HAD THE LIKES OF SLOVAKIA RUSSIA AND ENGLAND WE WERE UNDERDOGS TO GO THROUGH AND WE ENDED UP WINNING THE GROUP WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WALES WOULD HAVE WON THE GROUP ABOVE THEM THREE TEAMS THEN WE WERE FAVOURITES AGAINST NORTHERN IRELAND RIGHTLY SAW AND TONIGHT WILL BE UNDERDOGS AGAIN BUT I THINK I JUST THINK THE LADS SEEM TO THRIVE ON THERE AND THE DOG TAG AND PROVING PEOPLE WRONG AND THAT'S WHY SHE WAS BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER
A GOAL FROM PALAIS DID FOR JOHN CHARLES AND HIS WALES TEAM MATES IN THE LAST TOURNAMENT QUARTER FINAL IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT HOW HOPEFULLY THAT GARETH BALE AND COMPANY CAN GO ONE BETTER AND REACHED THE SEMI FINALS IT WOULD BE GREAT AS I SAID YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T EXPECTED TO COME OUT OF THE GROUP HAD TO BE THERE THE ONLY HOME NATIONS TEAM LEFT IN THE COMPETITION IS IS A FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT FROM CHRIS COLEMAN AND HIS PLAYERS SO IF WE CAN GET TO THE SEMI FINAL IS JUST CALL IT WHAT WE JUST WE JUST SHOW THAT WE'VE GONE ONE STEP FURTHER THAN WHAT THE GUYS DID IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT
IN LOSING IN THE WORLD CUP IN SWEDEN THERE ONE THERE ONE THERE ONE NIL TO BRAZIL OBVIOUSLY PALLY WITH THE GOAL SO IF WE CAN GO A STEP FURTHER IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC BUT EVEN IF WE DON'T I THINK THE LADS CAN WE HAVE CAN FEEL VERY VERY PROUD THEY'LL GET A HERO'S WELCOME WHEN THEY GO HOME BACK TO CARDIFF AND IT'S BEEN MAGNIFICENT FROM EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM JOHN HARTSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ENJOY THE GAME JOHN WILL BE WORKING FOR FIVE LIVE COVERAGE ON B.

# THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE THE UNVEILING OF LABOUR'S REPORT INTO ANTI SCIMITARS AND IN THE PARTY DIDN'T GO ACCORDING TO PLAN IN FACT RATHER THE OPPOSITE THE LEADER JEREMY CORBIN WAS ACCUSED BY SOME OF SUGGESTING THAT ISRAEL AND SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE COULD BE SEEN AS IN SOMEWAY EQUIVALENT AND THE HECKLER WAS SO UNPLEASANT TO A JEWISH M.P. WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE LAUNCH THAT SHE LEFT IN TEARS
THE CHAIR OF THE INQUIRY WAS CHAKRA BART. A FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP LIBERTY AND SHE'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WE DEAL FIRST OF ALL WITH THIS ISLAMIC STATE BUSINESS WHAT HE SAID WAS A JEWISH FRIENDS AND NO MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF ISRAEL OR THE NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT THAN A MUSLIM FRIENDS ARE FOR THOSE OF VARIOUS SELF STYLED ISLAMIC STATES ORGANISATIONS WHAT WHAT DID YOU YOU WERE THERE YOU WERE SO WHAT DID YOU TAKE HIM TO ME I TOOK HIM TO MAKE A DIRECT REFERENCE TO MY REPORT ACTUALLY SO I WANT IT I WANT TO BE CLEAR AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS HE WAS MAKING
NO COMPARISON WHATSOEVER BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ISIS OR ANYBODY ELSE HE WAS MAKING THE COMPARISON WHICH I MAKE IN MY REPORT RIGHT CAR BETWEEN THE WHITE THICK IF HE MENTIONED ISRAEL AS A STATE WHY DIDN'T REMEMBER MENTION FOR INSTANCE SAUDI ARABIA PUCK WELL OUT OF THE OTHER STATE WHAT HE WAS USING MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO ALL OF THOSE STATES AND ORGANISATIONS WHO WERE DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS MUSLIM OR ISLAMIC AND SHE WAS JUST CLUMSY NOT TO MENTION A PUNNET I WELL AT THAT POINT I MAKE IN MY REPORT WHICH HE'S REFERENCING IN A SHORTER SPEECH
IS A COMPARISON NOT BETWEEN THEIR ESTATES COS MY REPORT'S NOT ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY BUT A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE PREJUDICE THAT MINORITY GROUPS IN BRITAIN CAN FACE IN THE LIGHT OF EVENTS THAT HAPPENED A DIMENSION ONE STATE AND IT WAS EVERYWHERE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WHAT I WHAT I'M MARKING MY REPORT IS SOMETIMES JEWISH PEOPLE IN BRITAIN
FIND THEMSELVES REQUIRED BY THEIR BY THEIR NEIGHBOURS OR THEIR FRIENDS OR OCCASIONALLY FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE LABOUR PARTY TO EITHER CAN OR DEFEND OR EXPLAIN EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN ISRAEL AND PALESTINE BUT NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM THEY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE HAD A FIRM VIEW IN PARTICULAR IT'S UNFAIR TOWARDS FRESHERS ON CAMPUSES AND SO ON AND THE ONION EQUIVALENTS IS NOT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ANY MUSLIM STATE ORGANISATION BUT BETWEEN JEWS AND MUSLIMS COS MUSLIMS IN BRITAIN
OFTEN ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO BE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO CONDEMN OR DEFEND OR EXPLAIN AN ACTION THAT WAS NOT OF THEIR NAKED WHEN SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE MARTIN WADSWORTH A LABOUR ACTIVIST ASKED A QUESTION THAT DEEPLY UPSET RUTH SMITH M.P. WHO WAS THERE SHE SAYS THAT JEREMY CALL MEN FAILED TO INTERVENE AND I HAVE BENT IT TO SEE SPACE AND I'VE APOLOGISED TO HER IT WAS MY PRESS CONFERENCE AND I WAS CHAIRING IT AND I'M REALLY SORRY THAT SHE WAS
THAT SHE WAS TREATED IN THAT IN THAT WAY SEEMS A THEN THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY DON'T JUMP IN THE SAME AS I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN OR CAN I JUST SAY THAT BUT I WAS CHERYL I WAS CHAIRING THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND I PROBABLY DIDN'T GIVE HIM THE CHANCE TO JUMP IN BECAUSE I WAS SO QUICK IF YOU TELL YOU CAN LASTED OR HE HE HE CONCURRED WITH ME WHEN I ADMONISHED THE GENTLEMAN IN QUESTION FOR HECKLING NOT JUST NOT JUST MY SNEEZE BUT ME
AND FOR ABUSING THE PRIVILEGE OF ASKING A QUESTION OR NATIONAL PRESS CONFERENCE THE LEADER LOOK COMPLETELY CONCURRED WITH MONEY AND SUCH A LONG ARCH UNITY THERE WOODEN INFECTS HIM ACTUALLY TO SAY TO YOU CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING TO THIS PERSON AND PARTICULARLY WHEN THE M.P. WALKED OUT TO ACTUALLY SAY SOMETHING AND HE CHOSE NOT TO AND IT'S NOT I DIDN'T HARTLEY WHAT YOUR REPORTS ALL ABOUT THAT IS THAT THAT'S NOT MY IMPRESSION OF WHAT HAPPENED AND I THINK MAYBE HE AGAIN THE FAULT WAS WITH ME IF THIS HURTS THERE WERE JUMP WHAT
SHE HAD GOOD CAUSE FOR BEING UPSET TREATED RUDELY AT AT MY PRECIOUS THERE'S NO ONE FROM THE LEADER'S OFFICE GOT IN TOUCH WITH HER AFTERWARDS WHAT SHE WROTE THAT BLOKE IS A SIR AS SOON AS THE EVENTS HAPPENED I WENT TO SEE HER THAT AFTERNOON AND I WAS IN THE RENT WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKING TO SOMEONE NOT WHAT YOU ARE JOKING I SAID REMEMBER THE WHOLE POINT OF YOUR REPORT IT IS NOT YOUR JOB IS THEIR JOB IS THE LABOUR PARTY HIERARCHY AND IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT MUCH AS CHANGE LEAST TO HER IT DOESN'T WELL I
I SPOKE WITH HER IT WAS MY REPORT IT WAS IT WAS MY PRESS CONFERENCE SO I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR I HAVE TO SAY IT BUT WHAT FELT LIKE THE DELIBERATE MISREPRESENTATION OF THE LEADER'S SPEECH IT BY PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY VERY QUICK
TO TO MISUNDERSTAND AND CONDEMN AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY ALSO FOR THE GENTLEMAN HE BEHAVED FRANKLY INCREDIBLY RUDELY AT MY PRESS CONFERENCE AND PROBABLY MADE THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE ONE OF THE THINGS YOU DON'T CALL FOR IN EUROPE ON YOU MAKE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE WAY THE LABOUR PARTY SHOULD BEHAVE NO ONE THINKS YOU DON'T CALL FOR HIS LIFETIME BANS JUST KICK OUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ANTI SEMITIC RACES WHY NOT
BECAUSE I THINK ISN'T IT YOU EXPEL SOMEONE FROM THE PARTY THERE'S ALREADY A PRESUMPTION THAT IF THEY REAPPLY THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE COMPELLING FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS I AGREE WITH THAT BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE FOR EXAMPLE TO EXPEL SOMEONE AS A STUDENT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY THAT THERE WILL NEVER EVER EVER BE THE HOPE OF POSSIBILITY FOR LEARNING OR REDEMPTION AND I IT'S JUST NOT IN MY NATURE AND IN MY THINKING TO TUTOR CAN MAKE A RECOMMENDATION OF THAT KIND AND IN FACT I HOPE
THAT MY REPORT WILL BE ABOUT ASKING PEOPLE TO REFLECT AND AND LEARN AND TO SOME EXTENT TO REPENT ON A KIND OF SHOUTY SHOUTY ATMOSPHERE AND BEHAVIOUR WHICH IS WRONG WHETHER IT'S STRICTLY SPEAKING RACIST OR ANTI SEMITIC OR WE'RE NOT DO YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THE THINGS THAT YOU CALL FOR
CAN BE DONE UNDER JEREMY CORGAN GIVEN THAT HE IS CALLED HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH HIGH HIS FRIEND'S GIVEN THEIR SUSPICIONS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT WHAT HE REALLY THINKS ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS HE IS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT PROGRESS IS MADE WITHIN THAT I BELIEVE THAT THERE CAN BE PROGRESS IN RELATION TO MY REPORT HE EVER
HIS LEADER I LIKE THAT I JUST WANT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR HAVING COMMISSIONED THIS REPORT FOR NEVER ATTEMPTING TO INTERFERE WITH WITH MY FINDINGS HE WAS PRESENTED WITH A HARD COPY ONLY THE EVENING BEFORE YESTERDAY'S LAUNCH ANTI HAS WELCOMED THE ENTIRE REPORT WITHOUT QUALIFICATION AND ASKED
AND ASK THE PARTY INCLUDING HIS OWN CONSTITUENCY WITHIN THE PARTY TO TAKE AID AND I I WANT TO PAY TRIBUTE TO HIM FOR THAT I KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ALWAYS IN THE BUSINESS OF POLITICS TO TO TO TO BE KIND OR POLITE OR GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT'S CHEAPER I THINK MY COPING TO SAYS I WOULD HAVE SAID A FABULOUS MERINGUE SALLY CHECK I'VE GOT IT THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU
# TWENTY EIGHT OR NINE MARK CAN'T YOU HAVE A BANK OF ENGLAND GAVE A STRONG HINT YESTERDAY THAT INTEREST RATES WOULD FALL AGAIN SUE NOT THEY GOT ME BUT FOR THE PITFALL THAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR US FOR OUR PERSONAL FINANCES DOMINIC
YES JOHN HE GAVE THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE STAY HE COULD THAT RATES WOULD FALL PERHAPS THE SEEN THIS JULY AND SOME ECONOMISTS THINK WE COULD BE DOWN TO ZERO ZERO PERCENT INTEREST RATES BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND AS YOU SAY RATES ARE ALREADY THE LOWEST I'VE EVER BEEN HALF A PER CENT
FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS I'M JOINED DOWN THE LINE BY LOUISE COOPER THE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ANALYST TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR OUR WALLETS LOUISE WILL PUT ANOTHER RATE CUT MEAN WE ALREADY HAVE A VERY LOW RATES DON'T WE WELL IF YOU HAVE A TRACKER MORTGAGE WHERE THE TRACKER WHAT THE INTEREST RATE YOU CHARGED EQUALS BASE RATE
YOU COULD BE BORROWING FOR FREE AND THAT TELLS YOU THE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES THAT WE LIVE IN HOWEVER BEFORE WE GET TOO CARRIED AWAY AS IT'S ALL DUE TO BREAKFAST THIS IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM THERE ARE CURRENTLY ALMOST NINE TRILLION DOLLARS
YES NINE TRILLION DOLLARS OF NEGATIVELY YIELDING SOVEREIGN DEBT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT ACTUALLY YOU GIVE A COUNTRY ONE HUNDRED EUROS OR ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR WHATEVER ONE HUNDRED YEN AND THEY GIVE YOU BACK LESS THAN THAT A YEAR LATER WE WERE ACTUALLY
ARE TO HAVE SOMEONE LOOK AFTER YOUR MONEY FALLS IT SAY CONFRONTED WITH THESE BIZARRE TIMES WHAT SHOULD INDIVIDUALS DO BUT IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD IF YOU'RE BORROWING MONEY WHAT ABOUT IF YOU'VE GOT SAVINGS THIS IS THE PROBLEM SO FIRST OF ALL THIS
THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHERE DO I PUT MY SAVINGS WHERE DO I PUT MY FAMOUS TO GET ANY KIND OF RETURN AND WHAT THIS POLICY HAS DONE HAS FORCED PEOPLE
THE RISK CURVE SO RATHER THAN PUTTING MONEY IN THE BANK WE'RE UP TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND THIS PROTECTED THEY'VE HAD TO GO TO PEER TO PEER LENDING OR VARIOUS OTHER WAYS OR EVEN PUT YOUR MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET IF YOU PUT YOUR MONEY IN THE FOOTSIE FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE LOW TO THE HIGH YOU'D HAVE MADE TEN PER CENT IN JUST ONE WEEK BUT OF COURSE THAT'S A LOT RISKIER FOR CONTEXT IF YOU'RE PUTTING MONEY IN THERE
GUILT MARKET IF YOU'RE BUYING GOVERNMENT DEBT HE WOULD MAKE TEN PER CENT IN TEN YEARS SO THIS IS THE PROBLEM IT FORCES PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY AND FUND MANAGERS TO INVEST MUCH MORE BRISKLY COS YOU JUST CAN'T GET THE RETURN AN IMMENSE THAT FEAR BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE JUST NOT HAPPY WITH THIS IDEA OF TAKING RISKS WITH THEIR SAVINGS THEY THEY THEY WANT SECURITY WELL OF COURSE
THE PROBLEM IS THERE IS A PROBLEM FOR THE CURRENT SORT OF AGEING RETIRED POPULATION BUT REMEMBER THEY'RE THE ONES WITH JOBS FOR LIFE I'M DOING THE SUMMER SERIES ACTUALLY ON RADIO FOUR ABOUT THIS ABOUT HOW THE CURRENT SERIES KIND OF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AFFECTS YOUR FINANCIAL PROSPERITY BUT
IF YOU WERE TIRED YOU LIKE TO HAVE A FINAL SALARY SCHEME YOU LIKE TO HAVE A LOT OF ASSETS IN YOUR HOME A LOT OF EQUITY IN YOUR HOME SO YOU'RE KIND OF ALL RIGHT SIR YES THEY'RE COMPLAINING THEY'RE NOT GETTING MUCH ON THE CASH SAVINGS THE REAL PROBLEM AND THIS GOES BACK TO B.H.S. AND TATA STEEL AND ALL THOSE KIND OF COME IS THE REAL PROBLEM
IS FOR PENSIONS OF THEIR FUTURE BECAUSE BEFORE THE CRISIS GOVERNMENT DEBT TEN YOUR GOVERNMENT YOU DID SOMETHING LIKE FIVE PERCENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT NOW YIELDS BELOW ONE PER CENT BUT THEY'RE THERE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT OUR PENSIONS CANNOT BE INVESTED TO PROVIDE US WITH A DECENT INCOME FROM THE FUTURE THIS IS A FINANCIAL CRISIS FOR THE PENSIONS INDUSTRY YES WE LIVE IN STRANGE FINANCIAL TIMES THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOUISE COOPER AT THE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ANALYST
# THANKS DOMINIC IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD HALF AN HOUR AGO THE FORMER CHANCELLOR KEN CLARKE HAS GIVEN A NEW TWIST TO THE TORY LEADERSHIP CONTEST HERE IS THE VERY BLUNT MESSAGE HE HAD FOUGHT MICHAEL GO WHO'LL COURSE DECLARED THAT HE WAS A CANDIDATE YESTERDAY
I DO THINK MICHAEL GO WOULD DO US ALL A FAVOUR IF WE WERE TO STAND NOW AND SPEED UP THE PROCESS BECAUSE I DO THINK ONE OF THE FIRST PRIORITIES FOR A LEADER OF A PARTY AND CERTAINLY FOR A PRIME MINISTER IS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE TRUST SEVA AS POSSIBLE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES
WELL THERE WE ARE OUR DOMINIC IS THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. JUSTICE MINUTES HE WAS BACKING NOW MISTER GO WE GATHER ANYWAY YOU'LL TELL US THAT SO FOR THE SECOND JOHN P. B. B. C. IS DEFINITELY POLITICAL EDITOR OF THOUGHT FROM YOU FIRST JOHN ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT MY WORD WHAT A
STATE IT'S ALL BECOME IT HAS CONSPIRACY THEORY IS NORMAL AT WESTMINSTER ON A NORMAL DAY A LONG AGO FORGOTTEN WHAT NORMAL WAS EVER LIKE THIS IS AN ENTIRELY NEW PARALLEL DIMENSION IF YOU LIKE WE'RE SEEING THE ACCUSATION OF DEEP DUPLICITY BEING THROWN ABOUT THE PLACE OF LYING AND AND THROWN ABOUT IN FOUL LANGUAGE IN THE TEA ROOMS AND IT'S COME DOWN TO THIS THAT THE THE CONTEST NOW BETWEEN THE TWO B. PLAYERS IS MUCH MORE ABOUT CHARACTER
IT IS ABOUT POLITICS AND MICHAEL GO FOR COURSE HE HAS THE FLOOR TODAY THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS CHARACTER A QUESTION THAT HE'S RAISED HIMSELF ARGUING FOR SO LONG THAT HE HAD NO INTEREST IN WASN'T QUALIFIED TO BE PRIME MINISTER NOW BIG PLAYERS YOU HAVE TO BE PRIME MINISTER
REALLY SEE THAT'S WHAT THE PLAN IS IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT A BIT LITTLE BIT PRESUMPTIOUS SIR MAYBE SMACKS OF DISLOYALTY BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MICHAEL AND MICHAEL HESELTINE BACK BACK BUT HE WAS AGAINST MARGARET THATCHER IS THAT WHEN MICHAEL HESELTINE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE PRIME MINISTER NONE OF US BELIEVED IT FOR A SECOND AND MICHAEL MICHAEL GO WHO'VE HAD A RING OF PERFECT AUTHENTICITY SO EITHER HE WAS A MASTER OF DECEPTION
ABOUT THAT BETRAYS HIS QUESTIONS OR HE TRULY BELIEVED THAT HE WASN'T FIT TO BE PRIME MINISTER WHICH RAISES OTHER QUESTIONS AND SO IT COMES DOWN TO THAT HE WAS FIT TO BE THEIR JOB AND WHO DO YOU TRUST THE RIGHT WILL STAY WITH US A JOB BECAUSE WE'VE GOT DOMINIC ROYAL BONN AS WELL WHICH OF THOSE TWO PROPOSITIONS ARE DO YOU SUPPORT TO MY BUS DID HE MEAN IT AT THE TIME OR WAS HE BEING A BIT TOO CONSIDERS HER NO I DON'T
BUT EVERYBODY THINKS HE'S TREACHEROUS I MEAN LOOK AT THE PAPERS THIS MORNING BY LOOK AT THAT IT'S PRETTY RARE TO HAVE THIS SORT OF LIKE
AT THE TOP AND WE MOVE BEYOND WESTMINSTER PANTOMIME WHAT'S NOT SORRY BUT THAT JUST ON THAT BUT IT ISN'T REALLY JUST PANTOMIME AS IT DID WHEN IT WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY WITH THE WEIGHT OF KEN CLARKE ARE TALKING ABOUT STUDENT POLITICS WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO PEOPLE LIKE HESELTINE USE IN THE SORT OF LANGUAGE CONTEMPTIBLE THAT HE'S USED THIS IS A BIT BEYOND THAT IS ME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY VERY SERIOUS ISSUES HERE
WHAT HE'S DOING ALL RIGHT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT SORT OF SUPPORT HE'S GOT JOHN DOES HE HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT DO YOU THINK TO MAKE THEM A VIABLE CANDIDATE MICHAEL GOES GOT A PROBLEM AND THERESA MAY IS THE ONE WITH THE BIG MO WITH MOMENTUM SP SIXTY PLUS TEN PEAS A GOOD CLUTCH OF CABINET MINISTERS AND PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HER AS THE ONE WITH THE QUALIFICATIONS THE TEMPERAMENT
TO DO THE JOB I MEAN THERESA MAY IS THE FIRST TO SAY THAT SHE IS NOT EXCITING WHICH IS A CERTAIN PIECE OF OF HONESTY BUT THE ARGUMENT GOES THAT RIGHT NOW WITH THINGS AS DIFFICULT AS THEY ARE WHAT YOU NEED IS STABILITY AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THE FIRM HAND AT THE TILLER WITH THAT HE'S HER PITCH AND A LOT OF THEM ARE BUTCH MINSTREL ARE LAPPING IT UP THERE WE HAVE TO I DID I'M AFRAID JOHN PETER AND DOMINIC ROB THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
# THE TIME TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE HUNDRED YEARS AGO AT THIS MOMENT THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME HAD COMMENCED AND JIM HAS BEEN TALKING TO US ABOUT IT ALL MORNING WE JOIN HIM AGAIN NOW IN NORTHERN FRANCE
JUSTIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT WHEN SEBASTIAN FAULKS WROTE A GREAT STORY OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR HE CALLED THE NOVEL
BIRDSONG AND SO MANY OF THOSE WHO CAME HERE
AFTER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WROTE AND SPOKE ABOUT THAT CHORUS THAT COMES THROUGH THE TREES AS IT HAS BEEN THIS MORNING WHEN THE CEREMONIES BEGIN HERE AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHICH YOU CAN FOLLOW THROUGH THE DAY ON TELEVISION THAT FEELING OF TIME STANDING STILL MAY STILL TAKE HOLD OF MANY PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE THEIR OWN MEMORIES OF FAMILY REGIMENT FACTORY VILLAGE WHICH A DISTANT AND FRAGMENTARY BUT ON THIS DAY
VERY REAL SOMEHOW THE SONG FROM THE TREES HAS BECOME AN EMBLEM OF THE LIFE OF THIS PLACE THAT DID SURVIVE THE BATTLE
AND IT STILL HAS BEAUTY SO LET'S LEAVE YOU WITH THOSE BIRDS HERE IS SOMEONE WHO LOVES THE SOUND OF THE SEA
MY NAME'S GARY MOORE AND I'M A PROFESSIONAL WILDLIFE SOUND RECORDERS BASICALLY I WOULD WORK ON LOT OF PROGRAMMES LIKE WORLD WAR PROGRAMMES AND EYE SPECIALIST I GUESSED SKILL WOULD BE PARTICULARLY KNOWN FOR BIRDSONG
I'VE GOT LOTS OF GOT LITTLE RECORDER ON THE WAY BUT I'M CARRYING WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A DUSTBIN LID
IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A JOHN WALK BUT BASICALLY IT'S A LONG THINK ABOUT YOUR SATELLITE DISH ON THE SIDE OF YOUR HOUSE WILL PLACE IT LOOKS LIKE I'M HOLDING ONE OF THOSE IT'S A PARABOLIC REFLECTOR AND IT HELPS ME RECALLED HIGH PITCHED FREQUENCIES SUCH PERFECT FOR BIRDSONG AND PLACES LIKE UM THE JOINT PINNER THE OUTSIDER YOU IS A PINA IT'S LIKE A MASSIVE PIN OTHER FOCUSES THE SOUND ON THE CAP SHORT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT OF THE DISH AND THEN THAT ALLOWS ME TIME TO FIND AND GET PURE CLEAN BIRDSONG BASICALLY
AROUND US NOW WE'RE ON THE EDGE OF THE BLOCK MCGRATH ON THE CRATER THERE WAS EXPLODED THAT'S FROM TWENTY EIGHT IN THE MORNING AND YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT SOME SCORE A LOT
FOR THE SALFORD SURVEY WOULD HAVE HEARD WHEN THE DRUMS FOCI
SO TWO THING
THEY SAY THIS IS MY TERRITORY GO AWAY OR THEY SAY THIS IS WHERE I LIVE COME WITH ME
INTO THE BIRD SONG REALLY MAKES ME THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE
YEARS AGO MEANT THAT THE WOMEN BACK HOME WOULD THAT WHOLE GENERATION BETWEEN THE WARS NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO FIND TRUE LOVE NEVER WENT ON TO PRODUCE LANGUAGE THAT WAS WELL BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED
WE KNOW WITH THE SOLDIERS HOW MUCH BIRDSONG PLAYED A PART IN THEIR LIFE AS A WAY OF ESCAPING OF
THE POETS QUOTA OR IS IT ROSENBERG TALKS ABOUT LOCKS RELIEVES A TRENCH THERE'S A LOVELY PIECE ALL RIGHT GILBERT WATERHOUSE A POEM CALLED BIBBLE
TALKS ABOUT NOTCHING DOUSING IN THE WOODY TALKS ABOUT BEEN WOKEN BY A CUCKOO IN THE MORNING AND WE CAN TELL OF THE WOOD IS IN A GREAT PLAY
HE DESCRIBES THE BIRDS IN THE POEM THE WAY LISTENING YOU CAN CONTENT
BACK TO TAKE THEM TO A BETTER PLACE CLEARLY
THE PANDA OBJECT YOU LIKE IS ONE CALLED BILL WORKS AND IT STARTS OFF IN SOME CALL WOODING STOMP WOULD BE NAUGHTY GIRL SEWING ALL NIGHT AND THEN
AND PASSES I REALLY REALLY
HIS SERMON HERE WE GO IN SONG CALLED WOODY'S COURT WOULD THE CUCKOO'S WAY AT DAWN THE MAMBA
HALF A DOZEN LOCKS AS WELL SANG AND SANG IN THE BLUE THE CURTAIN OF DAWN
THAT SKYLARK SINGING IS ADMITTING THIS FRAME SONG AS DID TODAY IS IT
YEARS AGO SO THERE'S A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN US
AND THOSE SOLDIERS THAT REMOTE PLACES HUNDRED YEARS AGO WITHOUT
# AND THAT WAS GEN REPORTING FOR US AS HE HAS BEEN ALL MORNING FROM THE BATTLEFIELDS OF NORTHERN FRANCE TIME NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE AND IT IS TIME FOR OBVIOUS REASONS TO TALK ONCE MORE ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE POLITICAL WIFE AND MORE WIDELY FOR EQUALLY OBVIOUS REASONS OF THE RISE OF THE POLITICAL WOMAN MISSUS GO SARAH VINE THE WIFE OF THE MOMENT THERESA MAY PERHAPS ANDRA ANDRA LENT SOME AS WELL THE WOMEN IN CHARGE OR CLOSE TO BEING
IN CHARGE AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALL OF IT WITH LINDA MCDOUGALL WHO IS A JOURNALIST AND TELEVISION PRODUCER AND ALSO RELEVANT TO THIS DISCUSSION WIFE OF THE FORMER LABOUR M.P. AUSTIN MITCHELL IS IN OUR LEAD STUDIO ROBERT I CARE HE'S HERE WHO IS A THEATRE DIRECTOR AND WRITER MORNINGS YOU BOTH TOMORROW THEN I DO A WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF FUR SARAH VINES INTERVENTION
WELL EVERYONE ELSE SEEMS TO SAY IT'S LADY MACBETH BUT I I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE I I'VE DONE A VERY CAREFUL STUDY OF HER WRITINGS IN THE DAILY MAIL AND I DON'T THINK SHE'S HANKERING TO BE THE QUEEN OF THE DOWNING STREET KITCHEN SHE'S DESCRIBED HERSELF AS THE NEW KIND OF POLITICAL WIFE AND IN THAT GROUP SHE'S PUT MISSUS BLAIR MISSUS BROWN AND MISSUS CLEGG AND DENIS THATCHER AS AN HONORARY MEMBER AND SHE DESCRIBES HERSELF AS A LIONESS SHE SAYS
MICHAEL'S NOT ALLOWED TO GO OUT AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT HE THINKS OF THEM I KIND OF TIGER MUM APPROACH AND WILL STAY ABSOLUTELY AND SHE SAYS THAT SHE APPROACHES HER BUSINESS WITH WHITE HOT FURY THING IS SHE'S A SHE'S A BRILLIANT WRITER AND SHE'S QUICKLY COTTONED ON TO THE FACT THAT THE CHEAPEST AND THE BEST PEOPLE TO WRITE ABOUT YOUR OWN FAMILY BECAUSE YOU GET SHE GOT INTO ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW SHE WROTE ABOUT JUSTINE MILLER BAND'S KITCHEN AND THAT WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING
HEIDI ALEXANDER LOOKED AS IF SHE NEEDED TO EAT A FEW LESS HOBNOBS SO THOSE THINGS ARE NOT GOOD AND I HATE IT WHEN SHE WRITES LIKE THAT BUT SHE'S MANAGED TO GIVE US THE MOST WONDERFUL INSIGHT INTO MICHAEL GO AND SHE'S CERTAINLY CONVINCED ME THAT HE'S THE LAST PERSON YOU'VE NOT LIGHTING ON THE TORY AND YET OUR RATHER LIKE AS WELL AS GIVING INSIGHT WE ARE WE ARE CUT COME NATURALLY QUEASY AREN'T WAY AND THIS DOES GO RIGHT BACK TO SHAKESPEARE WE A QUEASY ABOUT THE POWERS BEHIND THE THRONE
OF COURSE AND I THINK THAT LADY MACBETH IS THE THE THE CLICHE OF CRAZINESS
PARTLY BECAUSE SHE'S THE PERSON YOU DON'T GET TO ALLOW THE PERSON WHO'S ONLY COS THEIR MARRIAGE OF THE PERSON YOU DID
I THOUGHT THAT WAS FASCINATING FOR THAT COMPARISON PARTLY BECAUSE THIS IS THE LEEKS EMAIL WE WERE REFERRING TO THAT'S RIGHT AND YOU KNOW ONE WONDERS HOW TACTICAL OR HOW ACCIDENTAL THAT WAS GIVEN BUT WHAT IT SUCCESSFULLY DOES HAS DEMOLISHED THE CANDIDATE WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT TO STAND AGAINST THEM I THOUGHT THERE WAS
I MEAN ON THE ONE HAND I FEEL SORRY BECAUSE YOU THINK EVERYONE'S PARTNER GIVE THEM ADVICE ABOUT THE THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO AT WORK WHEN IT'S A BIG DAY ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S QUITE A STRANGE THE SHIFT BETWEEN THE SECOND AND WHEN SHE SAYS YOU NEED TO DO THIS AND THEN THE STRANGE SORT OF THIRD PERSON AS IF HE'S A BRAND IS IT IS THE OTHER THING THAT SHAKESPEARE TELLS US THERE THAT ACTUALLY THIS EFFORT THAT WE CAN SOMETIMES MAKE TO SAY THAT THERE IS A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND THE PERSONAL LASHED THE WRIST OF COURSE THERE ISN'T
I MEAN IN SOME WAYS IT WILL IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY WITH BORIS TWICE JULIUS CAESAR SHAKESPEARE'S PREJUDICES IT WAS INVOKED FIRST BY BORIS HIMSELF AT THE START OF THAT RESIGNATION SPEECH ABOUT STUFF ABOUT TIME NOT TO FIGHT AGAINST THE TIDE OF HISTORY WHICH IS MORE OR LESS A DIRECT QUOTE FROM BRUTUS AND HIS FATHER OF COURSE SAYING TO ROOT OUT CUTTING BORIS'S CAESAR AND YOU DO WONDER
RIGHT ONE OF THE CARE WITH SHAKESPEARE IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE COW WITH THE BIT BEFORE THE BIT THAT BORIS IS REFERRING TO
WE AT THE HEIGHT ARE READY TO DECLINE AND LINDA WERE DO WERE TALKING ABOUT THE WOMEN BEHIND THE THRONE AS I WAS SUGGESTING AN INTRODUCTION WITH WE SHOULD ALSO BE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN WHO ARE INTENDING TO SIT ON THE THRONE BECAUSE WE ARE IN POTENTIALLY AM GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE WELL IT MIGHT BE MUCH STING THAN THAT WE MIGHT FIND OURSELVES IN AN OLD WOMAN'S OWN COS THE FIRST THING THAT NOW HAS TO COPE WITH IS THAT ALL OVER THE FRONT OF THE DAILY MAIL TODAY IS THEIR SUPPORT FOR HER HUSBAND'S OPPOSITION
A NEWSPAPER IS SUPPORTING THERESA MAY HOW I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR NEXT WEDNESDAY TO FIND OUT HOW SHE'S GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT BUT SO I PREDICT THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUT THERE TO PEOPLE WHO WILL FINALLY BE IN THE COMPETITION AT THE TOP OF THE TORY PARTY WILL BE THERESA MAY YES OF COURSE BUT ANDREA LETS THEM ANOTHER WHATEVER ANOTHER WOMAN WHO
WHO REALLY IS MUCH MORE CONVINCING I THINK IN THIS ROBE AND MICHAEL GO AND THEN WHEN WE TURN TO LABOUR AND ANGELA EAGLE DOES WHAT'S EXPECTED OF HER THEN WE COULD FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER HAVE AN ALL WOMAN COMPETITION YEAH AND LOTS OF INTERESTING THOUGHTS ABOUT THEIR PARTNERS AS WELL AND THE BACKUP WELL MISSUS GU PAIRS SPECIALISED DAMAGES TOLD US HOW HER HUSBAND CUTS HIS TOENAILS HOW HE TOOK SEVEN TIMES TO PASS HIS DRIVING TEST
AND HOW HE BUYS TROUSERS WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS THERE'S QUITE A LOT TO BE FOLLOWED IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CHOOSE TO GO TO A ROOT LINDA MCDOUGALL THANK YOU AND ROBERT IKE AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THAT IT OUT
