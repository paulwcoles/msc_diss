GENERALLY OVERCAST FIRST THING THIS MORNING THERE'S A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS JUST MOVING THROUGH ON THE BREEZE BUT MOST WILL HAVE A DRY DAY A THOSE SHOWERS FADING BY MID MORNING AND THEN SKYE HAS STEADILY BRIGHTENING SO WE SHOULD SEE SOME SPELLS OF HAZY SUNSHINE DEVELOPING FOR MOST THROUGH THE AFTERNOON THERE'S JUST THE RISK OF ONE OR TWO LATE SHOWERS THEN RETURNING TEMPERATURE WISE WILL BE UP TO NINETEEN TO TWENTY ONE QUITE WIDELY TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE IS POSSIBLE TWENTY THREE'S SEVENTY THREE FAHRENHEIT
NOW ON TO SOUTH WEST ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS WALES NORTH EAST ENGLAND AND NORTH WEST ENGLAND
LOTS OF CLOUD HERE THROUGH THE DAY TO DAY MANY PLACES WILL HAVE A LARGELY DRY DAY RAIN AND DRIZZLE WILL AFFECT PARTS OF LANCASHIRE NORTH AND WEST WALES ON AND OFF THROUGH THE DAY AND ELSEWHERE A FEW SHOWERS CAN BE EXPECTED BUT EQUALLY SOME BRIGHTNESS SHOULD COME THROUGH WE COULD GET A BIT OF SUNSHINE MOST LIKE TO SEE SUNNY SPELLS OVER THE MIDLANDS AND PARTS OF CUMBRIA WITH A BIT OF SUN TEMPERATURES COULD REACH TWENTY CELSIUS BUT GENERALLY CLOUDY SEVENTEEN TO NINETEEN WILL BE THE TOP TEMPERATURE
ON NOW TO NORTHERN IRELAND AND ALL OF SCOTLAND A FINE DAY FOR MANY HERE THERE WILL BE SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY OVER THE HIGHLANDS AND THE WESTERN ISLES AND ONE OR TWO SHOWERS DEVELOPING PARTICULARLY LATER ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND BUT MANY WILL AVOID THESE AND STAY DRY AND BRIGHT WITH SUNNY SPELLS AND TEMPERATURES GETTING UP TO BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY ONE CELSIUS TWENTY WHAT IS SEVENTY FAHRENHEIT THAT'S THE FORECAST
# ALEX THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHERE THERE IS A SINGLE STOREY RIGHT ACROSS THE FRONT PAGES AND A SINGLE FACE THAT OF TONY BLAIR LARGELY FROM THE APPEARANCE YOU MADE YESTERDAY IN THE WAKE OF THE CHILCOTT REPORT AT THE ODD FRONT PAGE PICTURE OF HIM WITH PRESIDENT BUSH BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THROUGH THE FINANCIAL TIMES CALLS THE CHILCOTT REPORT ONE THAT DELIVERS A HARSH VERDICT ON TONY BLAIR THE GUARDIAN CALLS IT A DEVASTATING VERDICT
ON THE IRAQ WAR THE TIMES HEADLINE BLAIR'S PRIVATE WAR WITH THAT LINE I WILL BE WITH YOU WHATEVER ON THE FRONT PAGE THE LINE FROM ONE OF THE MEMOS THAT MY BLAIR WROTE TO PRESIDENT BUSH THE SAME I'LL BE WITH YOU WHATEVER ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MIRROR THERE BOTH THE EYE AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH FOCUS ON WHAT MISTER BLAIR SAID YESTERDAY ABOUT TAKING THE SAME DECISION
AGAIN AND THE MOST SCATHING OF FRONT PAGES OF THE DAY IN THE DAILY MAIL AND THE SUN CALLING TONY BLAIR A MONSTER OF DELUSION IN THE MAIL AND ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SUN WEAPON OF MASS DECEPTION
A HUGE AMOUNT OF COMMENT IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF COURSE SOME PRAISE FOR THE REPORT ITSELF THE MAIL SAYS FAR FROM BEING A WHITE WASH THIS REPORT RAISES QUESTIONS WHICH SHOULD SHAKE THE ESTABLISHMENT TO ITS COMPLACENCY AND PROMPT URGENT REFORMS TO ENSURE NOTHING LIKE THIS COULD THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN BUT LET THE LAST WOULD GO TO REG KEYS WHO SENT A LANCE CORPORAL THOMAS KEYS WAS KILLED IN THE CONFLICT THANK YOU SIR JOHN
YOU'VE DONE THE FAMILY'S PROUD THE GUARDIAN'S COMMENT HAS THIS HEADLINE OVER IT BLAIR FOLLOWED A BUSH BLINDLY RUING IN A COUNTRY SHATTERING TRUST AND TRASHING HIS OWN REPUTATION THE TIMER'S ENDS WITH THIS THOUGHT IN ITS LEADING ARTICLE THIS WARDERS MADE ME A SURVIVAL THAN MOST OF MANY IRAQIS CAN HOPE FOR IN BRITAIN ITS LINK TO A DODGY INTELLIGENCE DOSSIER HAS FUELLED MISTRUST OF THE SECURITY SERVICES
AND CYNICISM ABOUT GOVERNMENT THIS LOSS OF FAITH HAS DEEPENED WITH THYME AND EXTENDS NOTE TO THE SCORER SHOWN FOR EXPERT OPINION THE RECENT WRECKS IT CAMPAIGN AT EACH END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE CHILCOTT REPORT A BRITISH PRIME MINISTER HAS FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS CATASTROPHIC MISJUDGMENT TO MISTER BLAIR'S ON IRAQ DAVID CAMERON'S ON THE REFERENDUM THEIR SUCCESSORS HAD THEIR WORK CUT OUT TO REBUILD THE PUBLIC'S TRUST
IT'S TEN PAST SIX CHILCOTT WAS AN INQUIRY INTO WHY AND HOW BRITAIN WENT TO WAR IN IRAQ BUT SOME OF THE REACTION FROM THOSE INVOLVED HAS BLAMED THE AMERICANS SO JEREMY GREEN STOP BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS AT THE TIME OF THE INVASION TOLD RADIO FOUR LAST NIGHT THAT THE UNITED STATES PUSHED THE U.K. INTO MILITARY ACTION TOO EARLY HE SAID THE U.S. DID NOT REALLY WANT A SECOND U.N. RESOLUTION TO JUSTIFY WAR
THE AMERICANS WERE GENUINE ABOUT IT BUT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS GENUINE ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT SADDAM COULD BE MADE TO BACK DOWN BEFORE WE HAD TO USE MILITARY FORCE AND GEORGE BUSH FOR A WHILE AGREED WITH HIM
BUT OTHER PEOPLE BEHIND GEORGE BUSH DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM AND THOUGHT IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME BUT IT WAS A VERY GENUINE ATTEMPT BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO SEE WHETHER THE SECURITY COUNCIL COULD PUT SUCH PRESSURE ON SADDAM HUSSEIN THAT MILITARY FORCE WAS NOT NECESSARY
SO JEREMY GREEN STOP JAMES LANDALE A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE HAS THERE BEEN ANY REACTION FROM THE AMERICANS TO THIS SORT OF CRITICISM JAMES NO NOT JET THEY ARE KEEPING A PRETTY LOW PROFILE IN RESPONSE TO THE TOOK A REPORT NOT SURPRISINGLY THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF DETAIL FOR THEM TO GET THROUGH AND ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF DIRTY LINEN THAT'S WASHED ABOUT U.K. U.S. RELATIONS IN THE PAST BUT IF YOU GO THROUGH SOME OF THE MEMOS THAT
TONY BLAIR SENT TO GEORGE BUSH YOU KNOW YOU SEE AN EXAMPLE A RELATIONSHIP I DON'T THINK ANY BRITISH PRIME MINISTER'S GOING TO HAVE WITH ANY U.S. PRESIDENT FOR A LONG TIME TO COME AND I THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED ABOUT JUST WHAT THE AMERICANS WERE UP TO AT THE TIME AND THE TENSIONS BETWEEN NOT JUST BETWEEN WASHINGTON LONDON BUT ALSO INTERNALLY WITHIN WASHINGTON BETWEEN THE PENTAGON AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT WHICH WAS FEELING SO
I'M SIDELINED BY MUCH OF WHAT WAS BEING DRIVEN BY PEOPLE LIKE THE THEN U.S. DEFENCE SECRETARY DONALD RUMS FELT THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF DETAIL IN THERE THAT I THINK THE AMERICANS WE WANT WE WANT TO LOOK AT AND I THINK WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION BETWEEN U.K. AND U.S. OFFICIALS IN TIMES TO COME FOR IT WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS THIS LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE THAT WILL BE THE INTERESTING PART WAS OF COURSE SO MUCH IS MADE OF THE SO CALLED SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP
AND THE THING IS IS THAT TONY BLAIR THE THING YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER ABOUT THIS IS THAT TONY BLAIR AT THE TIME
IN HIS HEAD WASN'T JUST WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE NINE ELEVEN IN HIS HEAD WAS YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER HE WAS A PRIME MINISTER WHO CAME TO OFFICE AS A MAN WHO SAW BEING CLOSE TO THE UNITED STATES WAS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT
THE LABOUR PARTY MAINTAINED IT SELECT ABILITY HIS ANALYSIS WAS FOR MANY YEARS LABOUR ELECTABLE BECAUSE THE PUBLIC SIMPLY DIDN'T TRUST IT ON NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY SO HIS POLICY WAS GET CLOSE TO ANY U.S. PRESIDENT YOU HE'D BEEN DISCUSSING SADDAM HUSSEIN WITH BILL CLINTON IN PREVIOUS AS BEFORE NINE ELEVEN AND SO WHAT YOU SEE IN THESE MEMOS THAT CHILCOTT REVEALS HE'S JUST THE EXTRAORDINARY STRATEGIC EFFORT THAT HE TOOK TO GET CLOSE TO WASHINGTON
COME WHAT MAY REGARDLESS OF THE POTENTIAL COSTS AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WOULD BE VERY UNUSUAL TO SEE REPLICATED IN THE FUTURE AND THAT IS THE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED BUT DIDN'T REALLY KNOW I MEAN THESE WERE DOCUMENTS THAT WITHOUT YOUR COT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DECLASSIFIED FOR A VERY LONG TIME OH ABSOLUTELY WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THESE YOU KNOW TO HAVE UNDER THIRTY YEAR RULING UNTIL THIRTY YEARS AFTER THEY'VE BEEN RECORDED BUT WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING IS THAT THE MEMOS REVEAL
THAT ALMOST AGAINST THE CARICATURE THAT A LOT OF THESE MEMOS ARE ACTUALLY GIVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DETAIL ABOUT JUST HOW HARD
TONY BLAIR TRIED TO SORT OF EXPLAIN TO THE AMERICANS PRECISELY WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE REST OF WORLD AS IN LOOK YOU DO NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE ARAB NATIONS YOU HAVE TO MOVE FURTHER ON MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING ANY INCOME SUPPORT FOR ANY ACTION IN IRAQ YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THE EUROPEANS THE FRENCH ARE INCREDIBLY OPPOSED WHAT YOU THINK THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO ABOUT THEM YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT'S THE THINKING UM IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT ALL OF THESE ARGUMENTS
TONY BLAIR MAKES AN INCREDIBLE DETAIL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SORT OF BUTTERING UP GEORGE BUSH PRAISING HIM FOR SPEECHES SORT OF BEEN A CALLING HIM WAS GREAT WORLD STATEMENT STATESMAN THAT HE'S GOING TO SET THE NEW POST WAR INTERNATIONAL ORDER IF IT JUST GOES TO THE UN A LITTLE BIT MORE SO YOU SAW THE GENUINE EFFORTS THAT TONY BLAIR WAS TAKING TO GET THE AMERICANS TO GO DOWN THE UNITED NATIONS ROUTE
# THE PROBLEM WAS AS WE ALL SAW ULTIMATELY THAT WAS A POLICY THAT ENGINE FAILURE BECAUSE THE AMERICANS ULTIMATELY IGNORED THE UNITED NATIONS JAMES LANDALE THANK YOU QUARTER PAST SIX THE DREAM ENDED FOR WALES AT APPROXIMATELY TEN PAST NINE LAST NIGHT RONALDO SCORED ONE GOAL AGAINST WALES AND THEN THREE MINUTES LATER ANOTHER AND THAT WAS IT YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE FANS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BUT SELDOM ENGLAND'S PERFECT THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED
LOVELY TO BE HERE FANTASTIC ATMOSPHERE WAS AMAZING WASN'T IT YEAH WE PLAY REALLY WELL WE CAN'T WE CAN'T GO AS FAR AS WE DID THE BIRDS IN ONE NIGHT REALLY WE LOOK TIRED NO GAME PLAN SO NO I MEAN
WE COME IN THE SEMI FINAL LOOK AT WOKE UP A FEW PRICES UP IN LYON LUGO WORLD CUP MATTHEW
INDEED WELL QUALIFICATION FOR THE WORLD CUP BEGINS IN SEPTEMBER JOHN AND I WAS TALKING TO THE WELSH CAPTAIN LAST NIGHT ASHLEY WILLIAMS WHO SAID THAT ACTUALLY THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS KEEPING THEIR SPIRITS UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE AS A TEAM HE SAID THEY'VE COME SO FAR TOGETHER HE DESCRIBED IT AS LIKE BEING ON A SCHOOL TRIP HE SAID IT WAS THAT THE WHOLE GROUP OF PLAYERS THE SQUAD EVERYONE BEHIND THEM
THEY SAY THEY'VE JUST HAD SO MUCH FUN HE SAID SO YES QUALIFICATION FOR THE WORLD CUP BEGINS IN SEPTEMBER AND A LOT OF THE FANS WERE POINTING TOWARDS THAT AS WELL SO THEY CLEARLY BILLET BELIEVE THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING THEY CAN BUILD ON WHEN I WAS GONNA SAY THE DEAD SERIOUS ABOUT THAT UP THERE AND WE HAVE TO TAKE WALES AS A FOOTBALL TEAM SERIOUSLY
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTICALLY MANAGED THROUGHOUT THIS TOURNAMENT AND IN THE RUN UP TO IT YOU KNOW
THAT THEY MISSED ARRAN RAMSAY LAST NIGHT HE WAS OUT BECAUSE OF TWO YELLOW CARDS IN THE RUN UP TO THE GAME THEY CERTAINLY DID MISS HIM AND I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE PORTUGUESE PLAYERS ACTUALLY WHO SAID IT TOOK THEM A LITTLE BIT TIME THEY'D OBVIOUSLY STUDIED THE WELSH TACTICS IN THE RUN UP TO THE GAME HE SAID THAT IT TOOK THEM A LITTLE BIT OF TIME
ACTUALLY OUT ON THE PEEL OUT ON THE PITCH TO TO WORK OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE WELSH WERE DOING BUT ONCE THEY HAD THEM THEY WERE ON TOP OF THEM IN THE SECOND HALF AND WALES PROBABLY DIDN'T PLAY AS WELL AS THEY HAD IN SOME OF THEIR PREVIOUS CAME CERTAINLY NOT AS WELL AS AFTER THAT FAMOUS THREE ONE WIN AGAINST BELGIUM ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATED TEAMS IN THE TOURNAMENT AND YET THEY DID DO THEMSELVES PROUD AND TALKING TO ALL THE FANS
IN THE GROUND YOU'VE GOT THE WORD GUTTED AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE WORD PROUD AND THERE WAS THIS LOVELY SCENE JOHN AT THE END WHERE FOR QUITE SOME MINUTES THE WELSH PLAYERS WENT OVER AND STOOD AND APPLAUDED THE FANS AND THE FEN SANG BACK AT THEM AND APPLAUDED THEM A LOT OF MUTUAL RESPECT AND WHAT A JOURNEY
# ABSOLUTELY REAL SPORTY MATTHEW THANKS VERY MUCH SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE POUND HAS HAD A BAD WEEK FALLING TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL AGAINST THE DOLLAR IN MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS COULD IT FALL EVEN FURTHER DOMINIC O'CONNELL HAS THIS MORNING'S BUSINESS NEWS DOMINIC COME ON IN SHOW YES THE POUND IS NOW FALLEN BY MORE THAN TEN PER CENT AGAINST THE DOLLAR SINCE THE VOTE OVERNIGHT IT WAS WORTH ONE POINT TWO NINE U.S. DOLLARS AGAINST THE EURO ONE POINT ONE SEVEN EUROS THERE'S MUCH DEBATE ABOUT WHERE IT GOES NEXT WHAT ARE WEAKENING POWER MEANS FOR BRITISH COMPANIES
THE STOCK MARKET HAS BEEN QUITE AS SHRUGGED OFF THE NEWS REALLY AT THE FOOTY ONE HUNDRED STILL UP ABOVE WHERE IT WAS BEFORE THE VOTE BUT FOR CONSUMERS IT'S LIKELY EVENTUALLY TO MEAN MORE EXPENSIVE FOOD HOLIDAYS AND PETROL
TO DISCUSS THIS IN THE REST OF THE I'M JOINED BY SIMON DEREK CHIEF CURRENCY TRYING TO JUST AT THE AMERICAN BANK BE IN WHY MELON AND KNEELED DUANE GLOBAL STRATEGIST ELLIE ANSWER GLOBAL INVESTORS SIMON IF I CAN START WITH YOU
PUT THIS IN A BIT OF CONTEXT THE POUND HAS BEEN ON A BIG SLIDE AGAINST THE DOLLAR FOR WHAT FIFTY YEARS OH COMFORTABLY IF YOU GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN SIXTIES STIRLING WAS TRAILING ABOUT TWO AND A HALF DOLLARS TO THE POUND AND EVER SINCE THEN WE'VE RATCHETED DAN I THINK THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COURSE LAST FORGER JERSEYS ONE DOLLARS SEVENTY FIVE POST NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE IT'S SIXTY FIVE WHO ARE COVER THE COURSE AND POST THE FINANCIAL CRISIS
WE WERE LIKE ONE FIFTY FORCE WE'VE BEEN STEADILY HEADING LOWER OVER THAT TIME IS LIKE THE VOLOS STERLING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THE STRAIN FOR THE ECONOMY THAT'S A FAIRLY COMMON FEATURE ACTUALLY FOR THE U.K. FOR A LONG TIME IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN BY MAGIC DUVET IT'S CLEAR THAT POLICY MAKERS IN THE LAST WEEK THE CHANCELLOR AND THE GOVERNOR MAKE COMING THERE MADE A PRETTY CLEAR THEY'D BE HAPPY WITH THAT WE COULD AND ARE PREPARED TO DO THINGS THAT WILL MAKE IT WEAKER ADELE THE CORRECTIVE YOU SO WILL MISTER CARNE HAD TO SAY JUST ON TUESDAY
HE HIGHLIGHTED LARGE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND HE SAID THAT QUITE EXPLICITLY AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED THAT THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL FOR THE POUND WAS RIGHT AND THEY WOULD ALLOW YOU THE U.K. TO BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE ON THE WORLD STAGE WE'RE MIXED INTO ONE DOLL TWENTY I THINK THAT'S FAIRLY REASONABLE I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE HAD A LOOK A LITTLE UNDER THAT THROUGH QUITE HONEST THINGS TEND TO OVERSHOOT
WE FIND IN THE NEW RIGHT PRICE FOR STIRLING WANT TWENTY DOESN'T SOUND THAT WRONG AND FOR CONSUMERS DOES THAT NECESSARILY MEAN THEY'RE ALL THOSE IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE PETROL FOOD
HOLIDAYS GO UP IN PRICE ON THE FACE OF IT YES BECAUSE THREAT QUITE CLEARLY BY THE THINGS FROM OVERSEAS BUT I THINK YOU'VE ALSO GOT TO REMEMBER WE'VE GOT A POTENTIAL FOR A SLOWING GLOBAL ECONOMY SO ACROSS THE BOARD WE COULD BE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT PRICES BEEN LLOYD GENERALLY THAT COULD THEREFORE ME THAT THAT'S WHAT WE FIND IS A SLIGHT MODERATION OF THOSE SHOP RISES MEAL IF I COULD BRING YOU AN WHAT COMPANIES DO WELL FOR A LOBE FROM A LOAD
CLEARLY WHAT WE WE'VE SEEN IN THE MARKETS IN THE LAST WEEK IS THAT THE BIG OVERSEAS EARNERS IN THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED WHO AS A GROUP OF HAVE UNDERPERFORMED AMID TO FIFTY SINCE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS HAVE DONE WELL SO THE BIG HEALTHCARE STOCK TO STAPLE STOCKS AND BECAUSE OF THE RESILIENCE OF OIL UNTIL YESTERDAY TO BE OIL STOCKS ALL EARN IN DOLLARS A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT CAUGHT MY EYE THOUGH THEY WAS DIAGEO WHICH IS WELL KNOWN BUT SOME IT MAKES WHISKY OR GOING TO SPEAR OUGHT TO HAVE THAT IN A LOT OF ITS MEANINGS IN DOLLARS
IT'S UP ABOUT SIXTEEN PERCENT SINCE THE BOAT THAT'S RIGHT WE'RE NOT I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN VERY SURPRISED HOW QUICKLY THE MARKET HAS GONE FROM A RISK OFF FOR THE WHOLE EQUITY MARKETS TO PICKING THE WINNERS AND LOSERS THEY ALMOST DID IT ON THE FRIDAY WE LEFT BUT IT'S A TWO SPEED MARK AND ISN'T IT WAS ONCE WERE DOING WELL FROM WEAK POUND AS ONCE WE'RE GETTING ABSOLUTELY HAMMERED LIKE THE DOMESTIC BANKS LLOYDS I'LL BE A SPARK OF ABOUT THIRTY PER CENT YES I MEAN I THINK WHEN ONE LOOKS PARTICULARLY THE BANKING SECTOR THERE ARE TWO UNDERLYING THEMES LLOYD'S IS REALLY TELLING YOU THAT THE MARKET IS FEARING A SERIOUS RECESSION
AT SOME POINT BECAUSE OF THIS THAT THIS THAT THIS THIS DECISION I THINK THE MORE INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND INVESTMENT BANKS ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE NOW THE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE POSITION OF THE CITY OF LONDON AND THE COMPETITION FROM PARIS AND FRANKFURT TO COME SO I THINK THEY'RE BEING BUFFETED BY BOTH THOSE FACTORS JUST A QUICK WORD YOU ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THESE PROPERLY FUNDS HAD BETTER BIT OR STOPPING WITHDRAWALS FROM FROM INVESTORS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS AND IT'S JUST BECAUSE A LIQUID INVESTMENT IT'S HARD TO SELL AN OFFICE BLOCK OVERNIGHT
WE WERE TOLD THAT BECKHAM THAT IN TWO THOUSAND CIVIL IN THOSE FIRST VERY FIRST HEDGE FUNDS GONE TO TROUBLE AND THEN WAS THE HARBINGER OF THE CREDIT CRISIS I THINK I'LL SEE ANY SIGNS OF HE LIQUIDITY UNNERVE INVESTORS AND THEREFORE THAT UNNERVES THE CONFIDENCE IN THE MARKETS BUT I I I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT WHAT I AM SURPRISED BY IS THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO TAKE THEIR MONEY OUT SO QUICKLY AFTER THIS DECISION WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS WE WE GENUINELY DON'T KNOW HOW OR IF AT ALL THE U.K. WILL SEE A COLLAPSE AND STERLING OR A SERIOUS RECESSION
I'M SURPRISED THAT IN THIS PERIOD OF HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY THAT MANY INVESTORS ARE TAKING THAT THAT THAT LONG TERM VIEW QUITE SO QUICKLY IT ALL TALKS TO INVEST AS BEING VERY NERVOUS DOESN'T THANK YOU MUCH NEIL ABOUT AND SIMON DEREK HAVE BEEN ONE MOMENT NOW THE C.B.I. THE BUSINESS FOR THE ORGANISATION HAS A CUNNING PLAN TO WARD OFF THIS OR ANY POST BRICKS AT SLOW DOWN START BUILDING POOR DRESS FOR THE C.B.I. AS PRESIDENT WILL MAKE A SPEECH TODAY IN WHICH HE URGED THE GOVERNMENT TO GET ON WITH THE NEW RUNWAY FOR THE SOUTH EAST HEATHROW OR GATWICK
AND OTHER BIG INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO PAULA'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO POOL WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO GET GOING NOW WELL I THINK IF EVER THERE WAS A TIME WHERE WE WANT TO SEE A BOOST TO THE U.K. ECONOMY IT IS NOW IN THIS PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY
THESE THREE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT YOU GET A VERY GOOD RETURN TO THE ECONOMY OF ABOUT THREE POUNDS TO EVERYONE POUND INVESTED YOU GET A GOOD RETURN IN TERMS OF JOBS CRATERED AND YOU GET GOOD LONG TERM IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY SO NOW'S A GREAT TIME TO BE BOOSTING THAT SORT OF INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO GET SOME EXTRA MOMENTUM INTO THE ECONOMY
TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE DANCER ONE PROBLEM WITH YOUR PLAN WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY AND YOU DIP TO G.P.S AT EIGHTY PER CENT WERE BORROWING SEVENTY FIVE DELINEATE JUST TO KEEP GOING AS WE ARE ARE YOU REALLY HAPPY WITH THE IDEA THAT THE GOVERNMENT BORROWS AN AWFUL LOT MORE LEAVES FUTURE GENERATIONS TO PAID OFF I THINK I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE IF WE WANT TO COMPETE IN A GLOBAL WORLD
AGAINST NATIONS THAT ARE INVESTING IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EXAMPLE IN AIRPORTS FRANCE GERMANY AMSTERDAM THERE VERY HAPPY TO EAT OUR LUNCH IF WE DON'T WANT TO COMPETE THEY WILL TAKE TO THIRTY BILLION A VALUE THAT WE CAN GENERATE BY TWENTY THIRTY
JEREMY HAPPY TAKE FIFTEEN BILLION OF A FRANCE RABBIT AGH SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION OF THEM SHALL WHILST WE PREVARICATE OTHER COUNTRIES WILL SEEDS THAT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES SO YOUR MESSAGE TO THE INCOMING CHANCELLOR WE SUSPECT IT WAS AN INCOMING CHANCELLOR IS DON'T WORRY ABOUT THOSE FISCAL TARGETS DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM IT'S IN THE BOOKS GET ON AND MAKE THE ECONOMY CAN PIDDLE OF SPINSTER MONEY NO YOU'VE GOT IT YOU'VE GOT TO MANAGE THE DEVILS THAT BUT BUT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT MAKING CHOICES AND THE AROUND PRIORITISATION AND AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE TO BOOST THE ECONOMY
JUST A WORD ON THE BRICKS OF VOTE PAUL THE C.B.I. WAS VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR OF US STAYING IN EUROPE DO YOU THINK PART OF THE BOAT WAS A REACTION AGAINST ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE C.B.I. THAT ASK PEOPLE TO DO ONE THING AND PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T LIKE WHAT BIG BUSINESS WAS SAYING I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM WAS A MESSAGE TO ALL OF US HAD U.K. SOCIETY
WE NEED TO LISTEN MORE CAREFULLY TO ALL PARTS OF THE NATION AND ALL PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY AND NOBODY BOARD THE COMMITTEE WOULD SAY WE REALLY SEE THAT WE HAVE A VITAL ROLE TO PLAY IN THE ECONOMY WE NEED PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE POSITIVE IMPACT WE HAVE
ON COMMUNITIES ON JOBS AND FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES SO I THINK FOR ALL OF US THERE'S A LESSON BUT WE NEED TO GET ON WITH RECOVERY IN MITIGATING DOWNSIDE RISKS AND GETTING ON AND GROWING THE ECONOMY CREATING JOBS THANK YOU VERY MUCH PAUL DRESS FOR A PRISON TO THE C.B.I.
# BRITAIN'S BOARDROOMS HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN A VERY MALE PLACE STUNT TO CHANGE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN LORD DAVIES INVESTIGATOR GENDER BALANCE ON BOARDS AND VINCE CABLE THE COALITIONS BUSINESS SECRETARY SET A TARGET FOR TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WOMEN ON FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED BOARDS
THIS MORNING WE SEE THE PUBLICATION OF A BIG REPORT TO HOW ALL THIS IS PROGRESSING AND GETTING WOMAN WOMAN PROPERLY REPRESENT AT THE TOP OF A BUSINESS AND WITH ME IS ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS DOCTOR SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE CRANFIELD SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT ON THIS RESEARCH SHOWS QUITE A MIXED PICTURE DOESN'T IT WITH WE HITTING THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TARGET BUT THE RATE OF APPOINTMENTS OF WOMAN TO BOARDS THIS IS SLOWING DOWN THAT'S CORRECT I THINK WAS IN PROGRESS IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL NUMBERS OF WOMEN ON BOARDS
IT HAS ACTUALLY SHIFTED A TWENTY SIX PERCENT FOR THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED AND AROUND TWENTY TWO PERCENT FOR THE FOOTY THROUGH FIFTY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT POWER GET WORDS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT UNTIL LAST YEAR IT'S THIRTY THREE PER CENT FOR TWENTY TWENTY SO NOW WE NEED TO LOOK AHEAD AND SEE HOW COMPANIES CAN TO THIS NEW TAG YET AND WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE RATE OF APPOINTMENT OF BUGS IT'S GONE DOWN A BIT SO IN ORDER TO HEED THE THIRTY THREE PER CENT WE ESTIMATE THAT ONE IN THREE NEW APPOINTMENTS MUST GO TO WOMEN
WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST YEAR ABOUT ONE IN FOUR APPOINTMENTS GOING TO WIN THE DEATHS THE LOWEST RATE IN ABOUT FIVE YEARS ISN'T IT SLOWED DOWN A BIT WHY SLOWING DOWN I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT LESS PUBLIC SCRUTINY AND CONVERSATIONS WHO'S THE DAVIES REVIEW HAS CONCLUDED AND HAS WORKED IN THE VISION AND INTO THERE
NEW HAMPTON ALEXANDER REVIEWER WHICH WILL SURELY GIVE GIVEN YOU BOAST OF THE CAMPAIGN AND RE FOCUS THE ATTENTION OF BUSINESS LEADERS ON THE COMPANIES WERE ONLY DOING THIS BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF NEGATIVE PUBLICITY I THINK IT'S MORE THAN THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT NAMING AND SHAMING I THINK IT'S ABOUT SHARING GOOD PRACTICE AND REALLY HAVING A COLLECTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD AND LEARN LESSONS ABOUT BETTER MANAGING OVER CITY ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF THE TARGET HAS BEEN THAT IT LED TO THE APPOINTMENT OF A LOT OF FEMALE NON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
WHAT DO YOU DO YOU ACCEPT THAT POINT WOULD YOU BE FINGERS AT SOME OF THE TEAM THAT CRITICISM I THINK CERTAINLY THE LONG TERM CHALLENGE IS ABOUT WOMEN IN THE EXECUTIVE PIPELINE AND EVERYBODY'S AWARE OF THIS AND INFECT THE NEW REVIEW OF THE HUNTLY ALEXANDER REVIEW WILL TACKLE EXACTLY THAT YOU NOW REPORTS THIS YEAR WE HAVE EXPANDED THE FOCUS OF ANALYSIS BELOW BOARD LEVEL AND WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES
WE FOUND THAT THERE IS ABOUT NINETEEN POINT FOUR PER CENT WOMEN'S THERE SO ACTUALLY FEWER WOMEN JUST BELOW BOARD LEVEL THEN ONWARDS TO THE PEACE OF THE PEOPLE WHO KIND OF ACTUALLY RUN THE COMPANY DAY TODAY BUT THAT ONE'S THE LOAD THAT THEM THE TOP BOARD AND IT'S THERE THAT REALLY WE NEED TO SEE WOMEN BEING A POINT COS THEN THEY CAN MAKE THE TRANSITION TO EXECUTIVE POSITIONS ON BOARD SO THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE PIPELINES FOR BOARD MEMBERS IN THE FUTURE AND THE SET IS IT GETTING BETTER REPRESENTATION WOMAN ON EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE'S GIVING
BIGGER WELL IT'S A GOOD QUESTION ACTUALLY WE DON'T QUITE KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE READILY AVAILABLE DATE OUT LOUD THAT NOBODY BUT HE WAS MEASURING IT NON THAT'S RIGOUROUSLY ENOUGH SO THAT WE FOUND THIS YEAR AS RESEARCHERS IS DEAD THEY DAYS NOT READILY AVAILABLE BECAUSE THERE'S NO MANDATORY REPORTING ABOUT IT SO WE REALLY THINK FOOTY COMPANIES SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO DISCLOSE TO GENDER BALANCE AT ALL LEVELS
IT'S WORTH SAYING AND PASSING THE NEXT BIG THING FOR COMPANIES IS GOING TO BE ETHNIC DIVERSITY ON BOARDS THAT'S GONNA BE PART OF THE OF THE LIB BARTER FOR THE PATTERN AS WELL ISN'T IT I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY BROUGHT IN THE CONVERSATION THERE'S ANOTHER REVIEW LOOKING AND DIVERSITY ON BOARDS THAT'S GOING TO COME UP
AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS CONFIDENT SAID TINGA VOLUNTARY GETS ON ALL THE DIMENSIONS OF DIVERSITY NIGER GENDER ESTATE FOR EXAMPLE KEEP THE ENERGY THEY HAVE TARGETS FOR GENDER ETHNICITY DISABILITY SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS AND THERE'S A VOLUNTARY TARGETS DEFINED IMPLEMENTED BY COMPANIES THEMSELVES

# THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM HAS BEEN NAMED MUSEUM OF THE YEAR THE JUDGES WHO CHOSE FROM A SHORTLIST OF FIVE MUSEUMS ACROSS THE U.K. DESCRIBED ITS DISPLAYS AS EXCEPTIONAL ENTERTAINING AND CHALLENGING TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN CHILCOTT HAS SPOKEN NOW WHAT OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL ERGOT IS NORMAN SMITH POLITICAL REACTION ON WELL I THINK THE OVERRIDING VIEW IS OF
CONDEMNATION REALLY OF MISTER BLAIR'S APPROACH TO POLICY IN IRAQ BECAUSE WHAT WE NOW SEEM TO HAVE IS A. FAIRLY METICULOUS AND REMORSELESS PICKING AWAY AT ALL THE DEFENCES MISTER BLAIR HAS CONSTRUCTED OVER THE PAST TEN TWELVE YEARS THE SUGGESTION THAT WE
HAD TO GET RID OF SADDAM BECAUSE IN THE POST NINE ELEVEN WORLD HE WAS A THREAT CHILCOTT TELLS US THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES TOLD MISTER BLAIR THERE WAS NO LINK BETWEEN IRAQ AND NINE ELEVEN THE SUGGESTION THAT HE NEVER GAVE UNEQUIVOCAL BACKING TO THE UNITED STATES WE NOW KNOW THERE A MEMO SUGGESTING HE DID GIVE UNCONDITIONAL BACKING THE SUGGESTION THERE WAS NEVER A DRIFT TO WAR NOW WE KNOW THAT MISTER BLAIR MY BUSH WERE TALKING ABOUT MILITARY ACTION MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE
THE CONFLICT THE FACT THAT IT WAS FLAWED INTELLIGENCE THAT WAS TO BLAME FOR THE CASE FOR WAR WE NOW KNOW MISTER BLAIR ATTACHED A CERTAINTY TO THAT FLAWED INTELLIGENCE WHICH IT DIDN'T DESERVE THE FACT THIS WAS ABOUT W.M.D. NOT REGIME CHANGE WE NOW KNOW BACK IN DECEMBER
PRIME MINISTER AND PRESIDENT BUSH WERE TALKING ABOUT REGIME CHANGE AND YESTERDAY MISTER BLAIR SAYING DESPITE ALL THAT IT WOULD RESULT IN A SAFER WORLD AND WE HAVE CHILCOTT SAYING NO ACTUALLY IT WAS AN INTERVENTION THERE WENT BADLY WRONG AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE ONLY CHARGED WHICH CHILCOTT DOES NOT STACK UP IS THE SUGGESTION THAT MISTER BLAIR LIED OR ACTED IN BAD FAITH BUT ON THE QUESTION OF JUDGEMENT
IT SEEMS TO ME CHILL COTTER'S PRETTY DAMNING AND CLEARLY VIEWS IRAQ AS A CATASTROPHIC ERROR OF JUDGEMENT THE TALK
GOSSIP PERHAPS REALLY RATHER THAN SERIOUS YOU TELL ME ABOUT IMPEACHING MY BLAIR AFTER THIS REPORT WAS PUBLISHED THAT'S GONE AWAY HAS IT WELL I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY
REALISTIC PROSPECT OF MISTER BLAIR BEING HAULED BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AS A WAR CRIMINAL INDEED I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS SIGNIFICANCE YESTERDAY LABELLED HIM A WAR CRIMINAL THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE FAMILIES MAY SEEK TO TAKE CIVIL ACTION AGAINST MISTER BLAIR FOR SO CALLED MALFEASANCE IN PUBLIC OFFICE HAVE BEEN NEGLIGENT ABOUT THE USE OF INTELLIGENCE I WONDER ACTUALLY WHETHER THEY WILL WANT
TO SPEND YEARS IN COURT BECAUSE I RATHER SUSPECT LISTENING TO THEM THAT THEY VIEWED THE CHILCOTT REPORT AS THEIR VERDICT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY WANT WHICH IS THE TRUTH AND MISTER BLAIR IN THE DOCK OF PUBLIC OPINION SO I'M NOT SURE
EVEN THEY WILL WANT TO TAKE NO M. P. IS LIKELY TO STAND UP AND SAY I WANT TO WIN PEACE WELL AND ALEX ALEX ALEXANDER'S TALKED ABOUT IT BUT I THINK IT IS DIFFICULT TO BE HONEST BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE SUGGESTING IS THAT HE SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR A SO CALLED A WAR OF AGGRESSION AS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT THE PROSECUTORS
HAS SAID THAT THEY CAN ONLY PROSECUTE CRIMES COMMITTED ON THE BATTLEFIELD NOT THE REASONS FOR GOING TO WAR SO I THINK THE PROSPECT OF MISTER BLAIR BEING CHARGED WITH BEING A WAR CRIMINAL I THINK THAT'S PRETTY REMOTE AND A QUICK THOUGHT ABOUT THE TORY LEADERSHIP CONTEST WILL KNOW TONIGHT WILL WE WE I MEAN WHO ARE THE TWO THAT IS WILL GET THE FINAL TWO YES THERESA MAY ALMOST CERTAIN TO GO THROUGH WHAT IS STRIKING THOUGH IT IS
# FEROCITY OF WHAT IS NOW EMERGING AS THE STOP ANDREA LEAD SOME CAMPAIGN WHICH WOULD SEEM TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT SHE IS ON COURSE TO GO THROUGH WITH MISSUS MAY BECAUSE WE'VE NOW HAD A VIGOROUS ATTEMPT TO SORT OF PICK A PART HER C.V. WHICH HE SEEMS TO
THEY DUMP HER ROLE IN THE BANKING SECTOR WE'VE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT HER TIES TO UKIP WE'VE HAD CRITICISM OF HER REFUSAL TO PUBLISH A TAX RETURN AND LAST NIGHT WE GOT CONFIRMATION THAT THERE ARE INDEED MOVES TO TRY AND GET SOME OF THERESA MAY'S SUPPORTERS TO BACK MICHAEL GO TO TRY AND SURE SHE DOESN'T GET ON TO THE FINAL BALLOT BUT THAT IS COMING UP FROM THERESA MAY SEIBERT FROM MICHAEL GOOSE TEEM WITH MICK BOWLS MY GOES CAMPAIGN MANAGER SENDING OUT THIS TEXT TO AROUND A DOZEN MAZE SUPPORTERS PLEADING WITH THEM
TO BACK MY LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A FEW LINES OF THE TEXT HE SAYS I'M SERIOUSLY FRIGHTENED ABOUT THE RISK OF ALLOWING ANDREA LED SOME ONTO THE MEMBERSHIP BALLET WHAT DID TERESA STUMBLES ARE WE REALLY CONFIDENT THE MEMBERSHIP WON'T VOTE FOR A FRESH FACE WHO SHARES THEIR ATTITUDES ABOUT MODERN LIFE LIKE THEY DID WITH I.D.S. QUESTION IS BUILD THAT BACK FIRE YOU'LL FIND OUT ABOUT HALF PAST FOUR THIS AFTERNOON
# AT THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN HOW DID THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES SPECIFICALLY M.I.SIX GET THE THREAT FROM IRAQ WRONG IN THE RUN UP TO THE WALL GORDON KARA IS A SECURITY CORRESPONDENT AND THE CHILCOTT REPORT REFERRED TO THE INTELLIGENCE AS FLAWED GORDON WHY WAS IT FLOORED WELL IT'S A PRETTY DEVASTATING ACCOUNT OF WHAT WENT WRONG WE GOT SOME RATHER STARTLING NEW DETAILS ABOUT
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS PARTICULARLY IN THE SOURCES THAT M.I.SIX RELIED ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAD THIS ASSUMPTION THAT IRAQ HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WAS JUST GOOD AT HIDING THEM WHICH THEY NEVER CHALLENGE BUT THEN JUST AT THE MOMENT THE DOSSIER WAS BEING DRAWN UP THEY WERE HUNTING FOR NEW INTELLIGENCE TO SUPPORT TO THAT CASE
AND THEY SEEM TO FIND IT AND THEY FOUND FOR INSTANCE ONE NEW SOURCE WHO CLAIM TO HAVE DIRECT ACCESS HER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS PRODUCTION BUT WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A FABRICATOR WHO TURNED OUT IT ALMOST CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE TO HAVE MADE UP HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS FROM WATCHING A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE RATHER THAN FROM HAVING ACTUALLY SEEN SOMETHING ALSO REMARKABLY PEOPLE RAISED THAT PRETTY QUICKLY WITH M.I.SIX YET IT TOOK THEM MONTHS TO WITHDRAW
THE INTELLIGENCE AND THEY DID THAT IN A VERY LOW KEY MANNER THE SAME WAS ALSO TRUE WITH THE INTELLIGENCE ON FORTY FIVE MINUTES TECHNICAL EXPERTS WEREN'T SHOWN THAT INTELLIGENCE AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER MATERIAL AND CHALLENGED IT AND YET THAT KIND OF INFORMATION WAS INCLUDED SO THE QUALITY CONTROL PROCESS AN M.I.SIX FAILED REALLY SERIOUSLY AND IND I MEAN AT LEAST ONE CASE THEY REALISE BEFORE THE INVASION THAT BUT THAT THE INFORMATION WAS WRONG
THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN WITH THAT THAT NEW SOURCE WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT DELIVERING ACCESS TO CHEMICAL CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS THEY THEY THEY BY FEBRUARY SO BEFORE THE WAR BELIEVED THAT THAT PERSON WAS LYING AND YET
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MINISTERS AND OFFICIALS WERE TOLD THAT AND YOU ALSO SEE IT AS THE MONTHS GO ON THAT ACTUALLY THERE'S THIS DELAY IN TELLING MINISTERS EVEN WHEN THEY'RE APPEARING BEFORE THE HUTTON INQUIRY THAT CERTAIN PIECES OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN IN THEY ONLY FIND OUT LATER DURING A FOLLOWING INQUIRY THE BUTLER ACQUIRED SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME PRETTY SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WENT WRONG THERE AND THE PROCESSES WITH M.I.SIX AS WELL AS FAILING TO CHALLENGE THE GOVERNMENT AND TONY BLAIR ON HOW HE TALKED ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE IN PUBLIC AND USING PHRASES LIKE BEYOND DOUBT DON'T DO WE LEARN ANYTHING FROM THE REPORT ABOUT WHY THERE WAS THIS DELAY BETWEEN REALISING THAT THE INTELLIGENCE WAS WRONG AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT MINISTERS
KNEW ABOUT IT NO WE DON'T GET A SPECIFIC REASON FOR THAT BUT BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THE CHALK REPORT HE'S CRITICAL OF IT AND IT SAYS IT'S NOT CLEAR I THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE CHILCOTT REPORT IS QUITE CAREFUL IT'S PUT ITS VERY DAMNING OF THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
BUT IT'S QUITE CAREFUL IN ITS LANGUAGE ABOUT ACCUSING THE INTELLIGENCE CHIEFS PERHAPS BECAUSE THE INQUIRY WANTED TO FOCUS THAT THE ISSUE ON TONY BLAIR IT LOOKS LIKE BUT IF YOU READ THE NARRATIVE AND THE DETAIL IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE REPORT IT IS VERY STRONG ABOUT SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE FAILINGS GORDON CAREER THANK YOU
SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND OBVIOUSLY A HUGE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE OF THE CHILCOT INQUIRY THE GUARDIAN SO THIS IS MORE FAR REACHING AND DAMNING DOCUMENT THAN MANY HAD EXPECTED REG KEYS WHO SON TOM DIED SERVING WITH THE BRITISH MILITARY POLICE IN IRAQ WRITES THAT THE REPORT CONFOUNDED HIS FEARS OF A WHITEWASH FOR HIM THE INQUIRY WAS JUDGE AND JURY AND ITS FINDINGS POINT THE FINGER OF ACCOUNTABILITY
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OR TONY BLAIR AND THEIR CRONIES WHO MY KEY CLAIMS HELPED THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER DECEIVE BRITAIN TO SOME DESCRIBES MISTER BLAIR AS A WEAPON OF MASS DECEPTION WHOSE NEGLIGENCE OR NAIVETY CONDEMNED ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE BRITISH TROOPS AND COUNTLESS IRAQIS TO THEIR DEATHS THE PAPER ACCUSES THE EX PRIME MINISTER OF ACCEPTING DUBIOUS EVIDENCE WITHOUT QUESTION AS WELL AS IGNORING CONTRADICTIONS AND WARNINGS THE SUN SAYS THE COURAGE OF BRITISH FORCES TOPPLED THE IRAQI LEADER SADDAM HUSSEIN
THE POLITICIANS HAD NO IDEA HOW TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY THE MAIL SAYS THE CHILCOT INQUIRY LAYS BARE THE APPALLING SHORTCOMINGS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND ESTABLISHMENT WHICH FAILED TO RESTRAIN MY BLAIR'S EXCESSES OR PROTECT BRITISH TROOPS FROM NEEDLESS DANGER CALLS FOR URGENT REFORMS TO MAKE SURE NOTHING LIKE THIS CATASTROPHE HAPPENS AGAIN THE MIRROR AGREES THAT HARD LESSONS MUST BE LEARNED BUT HE'S THE INQUIRY WOULD BE A DEVASTATING INDICTMENT
BUT SERIOUS QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED NAMELY THE PIVOTAL ISSUE OF WHETHER TONY BLAIR LED BRITAIN INTO AN ILLEGAL WAR BUT I'M SAYS SIR JOHN CHILCOT HAS CONCLUDED THAT BRITAIN FOUGHT A POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL CONFLICT THE PAPER ALSO REPORTS THAT A FORMER DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS LORD MACDONALD BELIEVES THAT BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEGAL CASE FOR WAR MISTER BLAIR COULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR MISCONDUCT IN PUBLIC OFFICE THE TIMES UNDERSTANDS AT SUCH A PROSECUTION APPEARS TO BE THE ONLY ROUTE FOR LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER BY RELATIVES OF THE VICTIMS
FOR THE TELEGRAPH SIR JOHN'S REPORT IS A LITANY OF SORROWS MISTAKES AND MISJUDGMENTS THE PAPER SAYS THE IMPRESSION GIVEN IS THAT OF THAT HAVE A DOWNING STREET TOO ABSORBED IN FIXING THE POLITICAL CASE FOR WAR TO WORRY MUCH ABOUT ITS AFTERMATH THE TELEGRAPH ADDS THAT SOME MAY SEEK TO USE THE INQUIRY TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS BUT THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE BUT OR TONY BLAIR'S JUDGEMENT TO GO TO WAR WAS UNDERSTANDABLE AT A TIME OF REMARKABLE INTERNATIONAL TURMOIL AND IT WAS BACKED BY MANY PEOPLE OF ALL POLITICAL PERSUASIONS
THE TIME IS A QUARTER TO SEVEN ON MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING SEVERAL SENIOR FIGURES AT THE CENTRE OF BRITAIN'S DECISION TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE HAVE RESPONDED TO THE CHILCOT INQUIRY IS CRITICISMS BY BLAMING THE UNITED STATES FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT FOLLOWED
THE PUBLICATION OF CHILCOTT DOMINATED PROCEEDINGS YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT BUT THERE WAS ALSO TIME FOR A GOVERNMENT DEFEAT ON THE FUTURE OF OTHER Y. U. NATIONALS LIVING IN BRITAIN OF PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN WHOM REPORTS THERE ARE SOME DECISIONS PRIME MINISTERS MAKE THAT REVERBERATE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AS HE STEPS DOWN AFTER HIS DEFEAT AN E.U. REFERENDUM
DAVID CAMERON SURELY KNOWS THAT AND IN THE COMMONS AS HE PRESENTED THE FINDINGS OF THE CHILCOT INQUIRY HE PASSED NO FINAL JUDGEMENT ON HIS PREDECESSORS DECISION TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ LESSONS WOULD BE LEARNED BUT INTERVENTION IS HARD
WAR FIGHTING IS NOT ALWAYS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART
OFTEN THE STATE BUILDING THAT FOLLOWS IS A MUCH MORE COMPLEX CHALLENGE WE SHOULD NOT BE NAIVE TO THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BEST PREPARED PLANS IN THE REAL WORLD THINGS CAN'T GO WRONG
AND EQUALLY JUST BECAUSE INTERVENTION IS DIFFICULT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ARE NOT TIMES WHEN IT IS RIGHT AND NECESSARY
THIRTEEN YEARS AGO JEREMY CORBIN WAS A REBELLIOUS BACKBENCHER ADDRESSING PUBLIC ANTI WAR RALLIES AND DILIGENTLY VOTING AGAINST HIS OWN LABOUR GOVERNMENT HE CAN HARDLY HAVE DREAMT THEN THAT TODAY HE'D BE THE LABOUR LEADER GIVING HIS VERDICT ON TONY BLAIR'S ACTIONS FROM THE DISPATCH BOX IN THE COMMONS AND OF DAVID CAMERON SEEMED RELUCTANT TO CONDEMN TONY BLAIR
JEREMY CORBIN DIDN'T MIND AT ALL THE WARS NOT IN ANY WAY AS SIR JOHN CHILCOT SAY IS A LAST RESORT
FRANKLY IT WAS AN ACT OF MILITARY AGGRESSION LAUNCHED ON A FALSE PRETEXT AS THE INQUIRY ACCEPTS AND HAS LONG BEEN REGARDED AS ILLEGAL BY THE OVERWHELMING WEIGHT
OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL OPINION IT LED TO THE DEATH
OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND THE DISPLACEMENT OF MILLIONS OF REFUGEES
DOES DAMS PULLS THE IRAQ WAR CHARLES KENNEDY WAS THE LEADER BACK THEN AND THE CURRENT LIB DEM LEADER TIM FARRON REMEMBERED THE BITTER CRITICISM HE'D SUFFERED FOR IT CHARLES KENNEDY WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG IN LEADING THE OPPOSITION ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AGAINST THE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE WAR AND SHOULD NOT THOUGH
WHO ACCUSED CHARLES KENNEDY OF APPEASEMENT SOME OF WHOM ARE STILL ON THESE BENCHES TODAY APOLOGISED TO HIM TO HIS FAMILY TO OUR SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN TO OUR COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE
LONG BEFORE THE IRAQ WAR LABOURS AND CLWYD HAD CAMPAIGN TO HIGHLIGHT THE MURDER AND ATROCITIES CARRIED OUT BY SADDAM HUSSEIN AND SHE DID NOT REGRET HER SUPPORT FOR THE WAR
AND I WISH PEOPLE WOULD ASK IRAQIS BECAUSE I WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE MISSION AS MANY IRAQIS ARE GRATEFUL MISTER SWEET
WE TOOK THE ACTION THAT WE DID
DAVID CAMERON AGREED THAT AT THE TIME PEOPLE HAD ACTED ON THE EVIDENCE IN FRONT OF THEM BUT WE HAVE TO BE FRANK AND THOSE OF US WHO VOTED FOR THIS THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT FOLLOWED
TRULY VERY POOR A FORMER VETERAN OF AFGHANISTAN THE CONSERVATIVE JOHNNY MERCER HE SPOKE FOR THE MILITARY PERSONNEL HAD THEIR FAMILIES IT'S A DESPERATE DAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF OUR SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN WHO I KNOW ARE WATCHING TODAY
WAR IS NOT A SPORTS AND NOW SHOULD BE A TIME OF DEEP INFLECTION AND HUMILITY ACROSS GOVERNMENT
AND ACROSS THE OPPRESSORS OF THE MILITARY WHO ADVISE THE GOVERNMENT FOR HIS VERDICT THE S.D.L.P. IS MARK DURKIN ADAPTED ONE OF TONY BLAIR'S OWN THE MOST FAMOUS LINES THIS IS NOT A DAY FOR SHOWING BITE BUT THERE'S THE PRIME MINISTER NOT AGREE THAT THE HAND OF HISTORY SHOULD BE FEELING SOMEBODY'S COLLAR
# THE IRAQ INQUIRY ECLIPSED BUT BRIEFLY WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE DAVID CAMERON'S CHIEF LEGACY AN OFFICE THE U.K.'S DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND LATER IN THE DAY THE GOVERNMENT WAS DEFEATED AS M.P.S BACKED HER LABOUR MOTION COLIN FOR OTHER E.U. NATIONALS TO BE PROMISED THE RIGHT TO REMAIN IN THE U.K.
BORIS JOHNSON SPEAKING IN THE COMMONS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE REFERENDUM BACK THE LABOUR MOVE WELL WELCOME THEY ARE NECESSARY THEY'RE A VITAL PART OF OUR SOCIETY AND I WILL BE PASSIONATELY SUPPORTING THIS MOTION
LABOUR'S SPOKESMAN ANDY BURNHAM SAID OTHER E.U. NATIONALS NEEDED TO HEAR THEY WERE VALUED AND WELCOME AMIDST ALL THE CHAOS IN OUR POLITICS LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK TODAY TOWARDS SANITY AND STABILITY AND PASSED THIS MOTION OVERWHELMINGLY
LABOUR'S MOTION SAID PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS BARGAINING CHIPS AND NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE MINISTER JAMES BROKEN SHA FELT THEY DIDN'T NEED TO BE USED AS LEVERAGE
ANY DECISION TO PRE EMPTY OUR FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS WOULD RISK UNDERMINING OUR ABILITY TO SECURE THOSE ARRANGEMENTS AND PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF E.U. NATIONALS AND BRITISH NATIONALS LIGHT AND TO GET THE BEST OUTCOME FOR BOTH FEARING DEFEAT THE GOVERNMENT TRIED TO AVOID ANY BUILT AT THE END OF THE DEBATE
OF THE COUNTRY NO
EVA'S ANGELA RAINER THEY'RE SHOUTING NO TO FORCE OF VAULT THE NON BINDING MOTION WAS BACKED BY TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE VOTES TO JUST TWO AS GOVERNMENT M.P.S LARGELY AT STAINED SUSAN HUME REPORTING AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST AFTER HALF PAST STATE OVER ON ONE NINE EIGHT LONG WAVE AND DIGITAL THE TIME IS TEN TO SEVEN
# A NEW CHIEF INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND WAS APPOINTED LAST MONTH AND M.P.S ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT NEIL CARMICHAEL'S CONSERVATIVE M.P. CHAIRMAN OF THE EDUCATION SELECT COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AMANDA SPELMAN THE PERSON IN QUESTION WHY ARE YOU NOT HAPPY I FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO TAKE HER AT THE REMAND THERE IS A VERY EXCELLENT PERSON IN MANY MANY WAYS AND HAS BEEN CHAIR OF OFF QUALEN PERFORMED ADMIRABLY
BUT DURING THE SESSION WE HAD WITH HER I THINK TWO THINGS EMERGE ONE WAS HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A CLEAR VISION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OFF STEAD AND SECONDLY THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH I WAS THINKING ABOUT CHILDREN SERVICES AND CHILD PROTECTION
A CLEAR VISION ABOUT THE FUTURE ASKED ISN'T IT OBVIOUS I MEAN IT'S TO KEEP SCHOOLS UP TO SCRATCH AND OF COURSE IT IS THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL FUNCTION BUT IT IS ALSO NECESSARY EFFECTIVELY TO BE A CHAMPION OF IMPROVING STANDARDS AND THAT JUST DID NOT COME OVER WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HEAR FROM HER THEN AYE WHAT DID YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM HER I'D HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT HER INTENTIONS TO DRIVE UP STANDARDS HER GIVEN
WELL IT'S A GIVEN IN THE SENSE THAT CLEARLY INSPECTION IS ALL ABOUT MAKING SURE STANDARDS ARE IMPROVING BUT WE DO NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF CRUSADING VIEW FROM THE CHIEF INSPECTOR AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS LACKING IN SO THAT ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO WERE THAT IT SOUNDS ALMOST I'M SURE YOU DON'T MEAN IT LIKE THIS
BUT IT SOUNDS AS IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE SOME ROSINGS STATEMENTS THAT WOULD GET PEOPLE CHEER RING FROM THE BENCHES AND IN FACT SHE WAS RATHER MORE MEASURED THEM BUT THEN DON'T YOU WANT THE CHIEF INSPECTOR TO BE RATHER MEASURED
OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO BE MEASURED BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO SIGNAL TO THE WORLD THAT BASICALLY WE DO NEED TO DRIVE UP STANDARDS IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAT WE ARE LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IT WE DO THAT WHY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ISSUES ABOUT SKILLS SHORTAGES WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO INCREASE OUR PUT ACTIVITY AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY DO GET A GRIP ON THIS WHAT SHOULD SCHOOLS BE DOING THEN THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING A LET'S TALK HERE WHAT ABOUT BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY
THE KEY THING ABOUT A GOOD SCHOOL IS EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP NOT JUST OF THE SCHOOL BUT WITHIN THE SCHOOL AND IT'S ALSO VERY NECESSARY I THINK TO PUT HER FOCUS ON SUBJECTS ARE MAKING SURE THAT THE DESIGN OF SUBJECTS AND THE PARTICIPATION OF STAFF IN PROMOTING THEIR SUBJECT IS AT ITS BEST AND THAT SOMETHING ELSE WILL BE SAYING IN AND IN A SEPARATE REPORT
BUT YOU CAN'T BLOCK THE APPOINTMENT CAN YOU NO WE CAN'T BLOCK IT THIS IS A DECISION FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE EDUCATION SELECT COMMITTEE HAS ERODED AND IMPORTANT ROLE AND THAT IS TO HOLD THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE MADE A VERY CLEAR VIEW IS WE'VE ALSO COMMENTED INCIDENTALLY ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF HEV'S DEAD BUT NOW THE SECULAR STATE AND I SHOULD BE MAKING A DECISION WHETHER TO APPOINT AMANDA NOT TO APPOINT AMANDA OR PERHAPS A PAUSE THE APPOINTMENT IT IS HER DECISION
DO YOU HAVE A ANOTHER PERSON IN MIND NO I DO KNOW THAT OR TWO OTHER PEOPLE WERE SORT OF MADE AVAILABLE DURING THE APPOINTMENTS PROCESS AS I SELECTED ONE IF YOU LIKE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND THAT IS AGAIN A MATTER FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE I SUPPOSE REALLY YOU JUST WANT ANOTHER MICHAEL WILSHAW AUDIENCE YOU MICHAEL WILL SHOW THE WATER TUBES BUT
WELL SIR MICHAEL HAS BEEN A VERY EFFECTIVE AND POWERFUL CHIEF INSPECTOR IT BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT PERSONALITIES THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE OFSTED CAN BE LEAD WELL FOR THE FUTURE AND I THINK THAT IF YOUR MIND IS APPOINTED I'M SURE THAT SHE WILL BE MINDFUL OF THE COMMENTS WE'VE MADE AND ADDRESS THEM
DURING THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD THERE IS OF COURSE STILL SIX MONTHS BEFORE SHE BECOMES CHIEF INSPECTOR IF SHE ISN'T A POINT IT WILL BE GOOD A GOOD OPPORTUNITY START REACHING OUT TO THE TEACHERS AND THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF SORT OF STARED MORE GENERALLY KNOW CARMICHAEL THANKS A LOT THANK YOU TIME IS SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN SCIENTIST FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SURREY HAVE PUT ON DISPLAY TWO TECHNOLOGIES THAT THEY PLAN TO USE TO HELP CLEAN UP SPACE

THE CHILCOT REPORTERS OPENED OLD WOUNDS ABOUT WHO DECIDED WHARTON WHEN IN THE RUN UP TO WAR IN TWO THOUSAND THREE SIR JEREMY GREEN STOCK BRITAIN'S AMBASSADOR AT THE TIME TOLD WELL TONIGHT TO THE UNITED STATES PUSHED THE U.K. INTO MILITARY ACTION TOO EARLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH SAFER HE SAID TO GIVE THE U.N. INSPECTORS ANOTHER SIX MONTHS TO LOOK FOR CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS IN IRAQ
AND HE TOLD NEWSNIGHT THAT THE U.S. DID NOT REALLY WANT A SECOND U.N. RESOLUTION TO JUSTIFY WAR THE AMERICANS WERE GENUINE ABOUT IT BUT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS GENUINE ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT SADDAM COULD BE MADE TO BACK DOWN
BEFORE WE HAD TO USE MILITARY FORCE AND GEORGE BUSH FOR A WHILE AGREED WITH HIM BUT OTHER PEOPLE BEHIND GEORGE BUSH DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM AND THOUGHT IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME
THOSE PEOPLE INCLUDED THE U.S. DEFENCE SECRETARY DONALD TRUMP'S FELT GENERAL TIM CROSS THE MOST SENIOR BRITISH OFFICER INVOLVED IN PLANNING THE WAR SO MY ROOMS FILLED WOULD NOT LISTEN EITHER TO THE U.N. THE U.K. OR EVEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE AFTERMATH OF THE INVASION AND AS A RESULT IRAQ'S ARMY WAS DISBANDED AND THE BA'ATH PARTY REDUCED WITHOUT CONSULTATION
TONY BLAIR'S FORMER HEAD OF COMMUNICATIONS ALASTAIR CAMPBELL TOLD NEWSNIGHT THAT THE AMERICANS DIDN'T DELIVER AS MUCH AFTER THE WAR AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE
THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT HAS NO INTENTION OF RE EXAMINING THE WAY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION APPROACHED THE IRAQ WAR IN LIGHT OF THE CHILCOTT REPORT SPOKESMAN JOHN KIRBY SAID WASHINGTON WAS CONCERNED ONLY WITH DEFEATING THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP OR DIE IN IRAQ AND SYRIA THE RECORD IS OUT THERE FOR ANYBODY TO SEE INTO A VALUE IT ON THEIR OWN

# THE CHILCOTT REPORT FOUND THE U.K. FAILED TO PLAN OR PREPARE FOR THE MAJOR RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME REQUIRED IN IRAQ THREE YEARS AFTER INVASION THAT FAILURE WAS PLAIN TO SEE WHEN I WENT TO BASRA IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SIX MADE A COUPLE OF BUSINESS IT WAS A CITY IN WHICH TWO THIRDS OF THE MEN WERE OUT OF WORK THE DEATH SQUADS AND THE MILITIAS PREYED ON THE POPULATION THEY WERE RARELY SHORT OF NEW RECRUITS KNOW JOBS MEANT NO PEACE
BUT THE SORT OF MASSIVE RECONSTRUCTION THAT WOULD CREATE JOBS WAS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL THERE WAS PEACE IT WAS THE WORST SORT OF VICIOUS CIRCLE I'M ON MY WAY FROM BASRA BASE INTO BASRA PALACE WHICH IS THE MAIN BRITISH BASE IN THE CITY OF BASRA HITS
MIKE WE HAVE TO DO THE TRIP HE'D DONE A FEW SECONDS AFTER I RECORDED THAT THERE WERE TWO TERRIFYING FLASHES OUTSIDE THEIR HELICOPTERS WINDOWS THE PILOT HAD FIRED OFF FLARES TO DIVERT ANY MISSILES AIMED IN OUR DIRECTION YOU'RE CONSTANTLY BEING REMINDED THAT YOU'RE IN DANGER
AND ONCE YOU'RE HERE ONCE YOU'RE IN BASRA PALACE YOU'RE A VIRTUAL PRISONER THAT A BRITISH DIPLOMATS HERE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE THE SECURITY COMPOUND INTO THE STREETS OF BASRA IN ALL THE MONTHS THEY'D BEEN STATIONED HERE I DID GET OUT ONCE BUT YOU'VE USUALLY GOT TO USE A WARRIOR THIS IS THE MOST HEAVILY ARMOURED OF HEAVILY ARMED THE BRITISH TEAM
IS ABOUT AS SAFE AS IT GETS ON THE STREETS IN BASRA WHAT BRITISH SOLDIERS CALL THE CORNICHE YOU CAN TELL THAT IT WAS ONCE A PRETTY ELEGANT PROMENADE
MY MILITARY ESCORT IS PRETTY JUMPY HERE EVEN WITH SO MANY CHILDREN ABOUT MAJOR CHRIS DE IS THE ESCORT COMMANDER SADLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT DAYS A RECENT WEEKS
EVEN AMONGST THE TYPICAL SCENES PEOPLE CAN EMERGE BUT I'VE PUSHED A LOT OF INDIRECT FIRE TAKES
LOT OF IT LANDS IN AMONGST THE CIVILIAN
GENERAL SIR RICHARD WAS IN COMMAND OF BRITISH FORCES IN THAT PART OF IRAQ SO THE EASTERNER RIGHT BETWEEN JULY TO A TWO THOUSAND SIX AND AUGUST SEVEN HE'S ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING WHAT WHEN YOU WENT WHEN YOU WERE POSTED THERE WHAT WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO FIND AND HOW DID THAT COMPARE WITH WHAT YOU ACTUALLY FOUND ONE I FOUND WAS A CITY IN THE HANDS OF THE MILITIA EVERY MOVEMENT AROUND THE CITY BECAME AN OPERATION IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND YOU JUST RIGHTLY HIGHLIGHTED THE REALITY OF ONLY BEING ABLE TO FLY IN AT NIGHT ROAD MOVES REQUIRED MAJOR MILITARY OPERATIONS WE SAW FREQUENT HAD EXTENSIVE FIGHTING
AND THAT VERY MUCH I THINK DIDN'T WEAR IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T CHIME WITH THE MESSAGE I GOT ONE I WAS BRIEFED IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE BEFORE I WENT OUT THAT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE ON TRACK FOR WITHDRAWAL
SO THE SITUATION WAS WAS WAS NOT GREAT BUT IT WAS AS YOU WILL REMEMBER I THINK I BRIEFED YOU AT THE TIME WE TALKED OF THE PART ABOUT THE OPERATIONS THAT WE WERE PUTTING IN PLACE TWO TO REBUILD AND REGAIN SECURITY IN BASRA SO IT WASN'T LOST BY THAT STAGE IT WAS LOST BY THAT STAGE WHEN WAS IT LOST
I THINK IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS LOST WHEN BY THE TIME THE DECISION HAD BEEN MADE TO PULL OUT BRITISH TROOPS FROM BASRA WHICH
THAT ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE AFTER MY MY TIME BUT I THINK IT WAS THE SENSE THAT I MEAN IT WAS IT WAS AS I DESCRIBED AT THE TIME THERE WAS VERY MUCH AN EXIT STRATEGY RATHER THAN A STRATEGY TO ACTUALLY PUT RIGHT THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY FIRSTLY THE INVASION AND THEN SECONDLY A PRESENCE AND WHEN YOU MADE THESE POINTS TO YOUR POLITICAL MASTERS WHAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE
I THINK I THINK I DO MY WEEKLY LETTERS YEAH THAT SUMMER LONG I'VE ONLY SCAN THE REPORT VERY QUICKLY BUT BUT MY WEEKLY LETTERS AND MANY OF THE POINTS MADE IN THOSE WEEKLY LETTERS ARE REPRODUCED IN THE REPORT
TO BE HONEST I DON'T THINK MY MESSAGE THE MESSAGE THAT WE COULD REALLY RESOLVE THIS GOT THROUGH AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO NEED A SIGNIFICANT SURGE OF TROOPS PERSONNEL
EQUIPMENT ET-CETERA ET-CETERA IF WE WEIGH TO TO REGAIN THE SITUATION I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH THAT THE MESSAGE SUDDENLY IT WAS ACCEPTED BY THE PRIME MINISTER WHEN HE CAME OUT IN DECEMBER SO I WROTE IF YOU ASKED ME TO WRITE TO HIM AND I DID AND I THINK HE CERTAINLY GOT THE POINT
RIGHT SO YOU DIDN'T GET THE SENSE THAT THEY SORT OF KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY SORT OF KNEW WHAT THE REALITY WAS BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT I THINK THEY HAVE THE AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF AND IT'S IT'S PERHAPS IT'S TOO GLIB TO ABOUT BLAME POLITICIANS POLITICIANS ARE ADVISED BY SENIOR OFFICIALS AND SENIOR MILITARY BUT I THINK THE PREVAILING
VIEW THE RECEIVED WISDOM IN PLACES LIKE THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE AND ELSEWHERE WAS THAT BRITAIN WANTED TO GET OUT WE SHOULD BE GETTING OUT AND CROSS DON'T FORGET PUT THIS IN THE STRATEGIC CONTEXT OF RAMPING UP IN AFGHANISTAN AT THE SAME TIME AS DRAWING DOWN IN IN IN IRAQ AND THERE WAS A VIEW CERTAINLY AMONG A NUMBER OF SENIOR MILITARY
THAT AFGHANISTAN WAS SOMEHOW A GOOD WAR WHERE IS IRAQ WAS A BAD WALL WE SHOULD GET RID OF IRAQ AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE TO TRY TO FIGHT TWO WARS ON WHILE WITH THE SAUCE IT'S A MISTAKE TO TO TO TO TO FIGHT TWO WARS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO DO IT
AND YOU WERE AGAIN MADE THAT POINT WAS MADE TO THE POLITICIANS WELL IT WAS SUDDENLY MADE TO AND MY PETS TO REPORT I CERTAINLY MADE THE POINT THAT THE ECONOMY OF FORCE APPROACH IS A FUTILE APPROACH THAT THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONDUCT WHAT WAS A DESCRIBED BY BY ONE JOURNAL AS A AS A AS AN INSURGENCY ON STEROIDS A COUNTER INSURGENCY OPERATION AGAINST THE SORT OF OPPOSITION WE WERE FIGHTING
YOU NEED TO MOBILISE AND CONCENTRATE EFFORT AND IT'S NOT JUST MILITARY EFFORT IT'S RECONSTRUCTION ITS DEVELOPMENT AT CIVIL EFFORT IN THE CLOSEST POSSIBLE HARMONY AND COMPLEMENTING THE MILITARY EFFORT AND YOU NEED TO DO IT VERY EFFECTIVELY
GENERAL MANY THANKS THANK YOU
ONE OF THE M.P.S WITH THE LONGEST CONNECTION TO IRAQ IS LABOUR'S CLWYD WHO WAS THE PRIME MINISTER'S SPECIAL ENVOY ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAQ FROM TWO THOUSAND THREE TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND THREE SHE VOTED IN FAVOUR OF THE INVASION AND SHE'S IN OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING HELLO HAVING SEEN CHILCOTT VERDICT THE OFFICIAL WORD ON THE WAR HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WAY THAT YOU CAST YOUR VOTE THAT DAY
WELL I WOULD HAVE CAST IT AGAIN ON THE BASIS OF THE EVIDENCE AS WE HEARD A LOT I KNEW MYSELF HAVING BEEN A LONG TIME CAMPAIGNER ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAQ WAY BEFORE THE WAR
I'D COLLECTED EVIDENCE FOR AN ORGANISATION I CHAIRED CALLED INDICT WHICH WAS SET UP BY THE AMERICANS TO WEARING THE MANE AND THE AGES THE REGIME TO JUSTICE
AND I HAD NO I KNEW THERE WAS SO MANY IRAQIS HALF A MILLION IRAQIS HAD DIED BEFORE THE WAR SIXTY THOUSAND KURDS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY SADDAM
MANY MORE DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES AND DOWN THEN THAT WAS AND THAT SHE WAS IN FOR ANGELS AS WELL THAT WAS WHAT INFORMED YOUR JUDGEMENT AT THE TIME BUT LOOKING AT IRAQ TODAY WOULD YOU CAST YOUR VOTE IN THE SAME WAY
WELL OF COURSE I MEAN EVERYBODY WITH HINDSIGHT FOR IT ASK A LOT MORE QUESTIONS BUT IT'S I THINK YOU CAN'T JUDGE PEOPLE'S ACTIONS AND WITH HINDSIGHT YOU HAVE TO JUDGE THEM I'M NOT AT THE TIME AND THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT SOMEONE LIKE ROBIN COOK DID HE ASSESSED WHAT WAS PUT AT THE TIME AND RESIGNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT COS HE SAID HE COULDN'T VOTE FOR THIS WARS AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHILCOTT SAID A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ WAS FORESEEABLE IN FACT TONY BLAIR HIMSELF PUT IT IN ONE OF THE MEMOS THAT HE WROTE TO PRESIDENT BUSH LOOK I CONTINUALLY ARGUED THE CASE OVER THE YEARS BEFORE THE WAR FOR INDICTING THE REGIME FOR WAR CRIMES CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND GENOCIDE AND I I BELIEVE THE REGIME COULD BE REMOVED BY OTHER
WAYS AND IT COULD BE YOU COULD A BIT REMOVED BY USING INTERNATIONAL LAW AN INDICTMENT AND IT'S IT WAS GREAT A GREAT REGRET TO ME AT THE TIME
THAT IN THE U.K. WHICH COULD HAVE LED THE WAY ON INDICTMENTS THEY'D NOT DO SO
AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF MAKING THE CASE PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF THE VICTIMS OF THE REGIME THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S JUST TIME FELT IT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT EVIDENCE THAT ABOUNDS AND IN FACT THE EVIDENCE HAD INDICTED COLLECTED WAS EVENTUALLY USED IN THE TRIALS IN BAGHDAD THE TRIAL OF SADDAM SAY A CHILD OF TARIQ AZIZ
AND SEVERAL OTHERS AND RE COLLECTORS VERY EXPLICIT EVIDENCE OF THE CRIMES OF THE REGIME BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IRAQ TODAY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AND WE'VE HEARD THE VOICES OF OF IRAQIS THROUGHOUT THIS WEEK AND REPORTS FROM A MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BOWEN
HE SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY HAS NOT HAD A PROPER DAY OF PEACE IN THIRTEEN YEARS THAT WAS THE RESULT OF WHAT YOU VOTED FOR IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
WELL I THINK SOME OF THE REPORTS I'VE HEARD OF BEEN QUITE SKEWED I'VE KEPT VERY CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE RIGHT THROUGHOUT THE YEARS I'M STILL IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH WHEN WE LOST ABOUT FIFTH EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO
DOWN TEND TO GO THERE AGAIN VERY SOON IT'S NOT TRUE FOR EXAMPLE AS IRAQ SECTARIAN WAR STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE NICK AT THE COUNTRY'S SHEER LOVED YOUR MAJORITY ROSE AGAIN SOMETIMES REGIME IN MARCH NINETEEN NINETY ONE
AND THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER UPRISINGS AND THE WEST ENCOURAGE PEOPLE AND THE IRAQIS IN THEIR UPRISING SO THERE WERE TWO REVOLTS AGAINST HIM PERSONALLY CODES AND SECONDLY FOR THE SHIA MUSLIMS IN THE SOUTH
WITH A MAJORITY OF IRAQ AND BOTH WERE PRESSED WITH GREAT BRUTALITY AND THE WEST AFTER THAT IS OF COURSE SET UP SAFE HAVENS A NO FLY ZONE
SANCTIONS WERE NOT PROPERLY WORKING THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO WORK BY THE UN BECAUSE OIL FOR FOOD AND THE FOURTH'S INITIALLY WAS USED BY SADDAM FOR HIS OWN WEANS AND WAS NOT TO USE AND FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ AND CLWYD THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# IT IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MARKS AND SPENCER HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR AGES TO STOP THE SLIDE IN THEIR CLOTHING SALES AND I'VE BEEN TERRIBLY WELL HAD IT DOMINIC NO THANKS JOHN IT WAS A NASTY SHOCK FOR HIM AND HIS SHAREHOLDERS THIS MORNING ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO PUBLISHED
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS UP TO THE START OF JULY AND IT SHOWED THAT SALES OF CLOTHING WITH DOWN EIGHT POINT THREE PER CENT THAT'S TWICE AS BAD AS MOST WERE EXPECTING MAYBE THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE ROUND ABOUT FOUR WITH ME AS BRIAN SINCE SITE DIRECTOR AT RETAIL EXPERTS TK GLOBAL BRIAN IT'S KIND OF THE SAME OLD STORY IN THE MISS BUT PERHAPS EVEN A BIT WORSE THAN THIS CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS AN ABSOLUTE SHOCKER ACTUALLY SAID THE EXPECTATIONS WERE DYING FOUR PER CENT PERHAPS DOWN SIX PERCENT BUT TIME MAYBE NINE PER CENT
IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE AND ALL FOR LISTED RETAILERS WHO HAVE REPORTED THIS MORNING HAVE POINTED TOWARDS SOME VERY UNPREDICTABLE WEATHER PATTERNS IS DISRUPTING THEIR
THEIR BUSINESS BUT THAT'S A NINE PERCENT DECLINE BUT IT DOES SUGGEST THAT ALL IS NOT RIGHT IN THE EMINENCE CLOTHING RANGE THAT OLD THAT OLD EXCUSE OF WITH A GOOD RETAIL CAN CHIEF EXECUTIVES HAVE GOT ANOTHER GREAT EXCUSE TO HEAVEN THEY WITH THE BRICKS AT VOTE AND IN THE STATEMENT STEVE ROWE WHO'S THE RECENTLY APPOINTED
CHIEF EXECUTIVE M. AND S. SINCE THAT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE WEEK IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENCE IT'S IN THE IN THE RUN UP TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM IT'S TOO EARLY TO QUALIFY THE IMPLICATIONS OF BRICKS AT THE YOU EXPECT CHIEF EXECUTIVES TO BE I'M NOT ONLY ON THE WAY THERE BUT ALSO BRICKS IT TO EXPLAIN THEIR POOR PERFORMANCE INDEED I THINK THAT THAT IS THE RE TELL US THIS MORNING HAVE MENTIONED I WAS A SLOW DOWN AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM HAS BEEN A MOCKED UP TO MUCH GREATER UNCERTAINTY SINCE
THE OUTCOME OF THAT REFERENCE AS WARM AND PRIMARK WHICH ALSO REPORTED THIS MORNING SUGGESTED THAT BRICKS IT WILL HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS MARGINS GOING FORWARD SO YEAH WE'VE GOT WEATHER WE'VE GOT PACKS IT ALL ALL ALL OF THE RETAILERS WHO REPORTS TO HER POINTED TOWARDS BOTH FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS A DISAPPOINTING PERFORMANCE STAY WITH HIM IN US FOR ONE LAST POINT DO YOU THINK THAT FINALLY IT'S TIME TO START THINKING SOME RADICAL THOUGHTS IN THE MISS IF WE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS TRIED TO REINVIGORATE CLOTHING SELLS THEY'VE ALL FAILED ISN'T IT TIME FOR SOMETHING BIG LIKE A BREAK UP OR SALE
WHETHER THEY'VE POINTED TOWARDS THE FACT THAT THEY'VE BEEN INVESTING VERY VERY HEAVILY AND LOWER PRICES AND FEWER PROMOTIONS WHICH EXPLAIN SOME OF THE DECLINE SO PERHAPS THEY ARE BEING A BIT MORE ADVENTUROUS A BIT MORE BOLD IN TERMS OF HAD THE TRYING TO GO TO MARKET BUT YOU LOOK AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE FOOD BUSINESS IN THE CLOTHING BUSINESS AND IF THERE HAVE BEEN SOME OBSERVERS HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR SOME SORT OF DIFFERENT APPROACH TO TO TO RUNNING THE BUSINESS SEPARATELY BUT I THINK THE BUSINESS IS INHERENTLY SOLID BUT THEY JUST NEED TO CRACK WOMENSWEAR AND THAT'S THAT'S THE BIG ASK WHICH IS
RESPECTING TO HOPEFULLY SEE SOME PROGRESS ON AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES THE OTHER ONE THE OTHER BIG RETAILERS REPORTING THIS MORNING THE SPORTS DIRECTOR MIKE ASHLEY WHO WHO WHO'S THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER HAS BEEN IN THE HEADLINES FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS SOME FRONT SLIT COMMITTEES THEIR RESULTS WENT TOO BAD BAD PIA DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE THERE
TRADING THIS WAS SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTING AGAIN THE WEATHER AND ENGLISH ENGLAND'S EARLY EXIT WON'T HAVE HELPED EITHER BUT YET CAN BE PROFITS RUNNING DOWN SLIGHTLY SOUNDS RUNNING DOWN SLIGHTLY AS WELL AND I THINK THAT BUT REASONABLY OPTIMISTIC LOOKING FOR TOWARDS THE NEXT YEAR THANK YOU MUCH BRYAN ROBERTS OF T. C. SEEK GLOBAL
# SONIC IT IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THREE YEARS AGO THE GOVERNMENT CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT G.P.S WOULD BE ABLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS BUT I'VE ACTUALLY NAMING THAT WAS ALL ANON ABOUT HE'S WITH THE REST OF THE HEALTH SERVICE ENERGY WITH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES NOW THAT IDEA HAS BEEN ABANDONED DOCTOR DANIEL POULTER IS WAS THE HEALTH MINISTER THOUGHT THREE YEARS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND FIFTEEN AND HE IS IN AN N.H.S. HOSPITAL DOCTOR MORNING TO YOU MORNING WAS THIS THE RIGHT DECISION TO ABANDON IT THAT IS
AND MY CONCERN ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS I I THINK THAT CUT THE INFORMATION SHARING IN THE N.H.S. IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY MANY YEARS PARTICULARLY IN THE SECONDARY CARE IN THE HOSPITAL SECTOR AND THAT INFORMATION SHARING HAS PROVEN TO BE SECURE IN HOWITZER USED DATA MAINTAINING PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY IT'S ALSO LED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN CARE AND WE ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT MATERNITY SERVICES AND THE
CONFIDENTIAL INQUIRIES INTO MATERNAL DEATHS TO LOOK AT HOW RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE MADE TO IMPROVE INDIRECT IMPROVE INTRODUCE INDIRECT CAUSE MATERNAL DEATH LIKE SUICIDE AND IMPROVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH DOESN'T TO KNOW THE INFORMATION SHARING IS GENERALLY A GOOD THING SO I WONDER WHETHER SOME OF THE
POLITICAL FOR RAW ABOUT DATA SHARING HAS GOT IN THEIR WAY PERHAPS OF RECOGNISING THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT TO PATIENTS EFFECTIVELY USING DATA TO IMPROVE CARE NOT FIT FIONA CALDECOTT WHO REVIEWED THE WHOLE THING SAID THAT HER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT IS NOT TO GO AHEAD WITH IT WAS CENTRED ON TRUST
BUILDING PUBLIC TRUST FOR THE USE OF HEALTH AND CARE DATA MEANS GIVING PEOPLE CONFIDENCE THAT THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION IS KEPT SECURE AND USED IN THEIR INTERESTS AND OBVIOUSLY WORRIED ABOUT THAT I THINK I THINK THERE'S A FAIR POINT I AM NOT DAME KILLED OR VIENNA HAS COME FORWARD WITH BECAUSE WE WE KNOW THAT CHESS HAS A GENERAL A VERY GOOD TRACK RECORD OF KEEPING HIM ENTERTAINING PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY WITH THE INFORMATION THAT IT IT HAS A THAN A G.P. SURGERY
OR IN HOSPITALS BUT IF WE GO BACK TWO OR THREE YEARS THERE WAS A BIG POLITICAL FOR ALL ABOUT WHAT WAS NOT MUCH MORE REALLY THEN EH YES VERY SIMPLE EXTENSION OF A PRINCIPLE THAT ORRERY EXISTS IN HOSPITAL CARE WHICH IS COLLECTING DATA TO MAKE SURE WE CAN LOOK AT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE
TO FACILITATE THE ABILITY TO REDUCE HEALTH INEQUALITIES BY SEEING SOME PEOPLE IN THE POPULATION WE LOOKED AT IN A CONFIDENTIAL AND POPULATION LEVEL HOW THAT DATA CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE HOW SERVICES ARE COMMISSIONED RUN
SO I THINK THAT POLITICAL FOR OR LEAD TO DON'T LOOKIN THIS IN RECOGNISING QUITE RIGHTLY THAT WHEN THERE'S A POLITICAL DEBATE CARRIED OUT IN THE NEWSPAPERS THAT CAN IMPINGE UPON TAKE PATIENT TRUST AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S ALREADY GOING ON THE OTHER MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY SAY WOULDN'T THEY SO LONG AS THEY COULD BE ASSURED THAT THEIR OWN IDENTITY WOULD BE SAFE YEAH BY ALL MEANS LET OTHER PEOPLE BENEFIT FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED FOR MANY MANY YEARS PARTICULARLY FOR DIRECT CARE IN
THE HOSPITAL SECTOR I OUTLINED FOR EXAMPLE HOW THAT DATA IS USED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOW WOMEN COULD BE CARED FOR AND HOW WE CAN REDUCE MATERNAL DEATH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S A VERY GOOD POSITIVE THING AND WILL HOPEFULLY IMPROVE MATERNITY SERVICES IN THE FUTURE AND THEIR HUGE BENEFITS GENERALLY TO RESEARCH FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE BETTER UNDERSTAND HER PATIENTS ARE CARED FOR
AND IT ALSO HELPS THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMISSIONING SERVICES LOCAL LEVEL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WORKED WELL AND WHAT HASN'T WORKED WELL BUT PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS ABOUT WE TALK OFTEN ABOUT INTEGRATING IN JOINING UP SERVICES IN MANCHESTER AND ELSEWHERE UNLESS WE CAN SHARE DATA EFFECTIVELY BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND NOT BE WORRIED ABOUT THAT THEN IT COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO COMMISSION EFFECTIVE INTEGRATED CARE AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BEAR IN MIND GOING FORWARD DOCTOR BOULDER THANKS
# TIME IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND AFTER LAST NIGHT'S BIG MATCH THE SPORTS NEWS COMES FROM ON THIS MORNING WITH MATTHEW PRICE MORNING MATTHEW
GOOD MORNING INDEED FROM LYON WHERE THE WELSH EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN DREAM CAME TO A CRUSHING END THEY WERE BEATEN TWO ZERO IN THE SEMI FINAL BY PORTUGAL CRISTIANO RONALDO SCORED IN QUICK SUCCESSION IN THE SECOND HALF TO SEAL THE RESULT
THE FANS AND THE PLAYERS ON THE WELSH TEAM APPLAUDED ONE ANOTHER AFTER THE GAME FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN THE STADIUM AND TWO WORDS KEPT COMING UP FROM THE SUPPORTERS GUTTED
BUT PROUD THAT IS EXACTLY HOW WELSH MIDFIELDER JOE LEDLEY TOLD ME THE PLAYERS WERE FEELING
VERY PROUD OBVIOUSLY SO GUTTED AS WELL JUST ONE STEP CLOSER TO THEIR DREAM BUT WE CAN HOLD OUR HEADS UP HIGH AND WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED IN THIS COMPETITION AND THIS FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENTS
WHAT DO YOU THINK WENT WRONG THIS EVENING I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE VERY STRONG PORTUGUESE TEAM
SLOPPY GOALS ON MA I THINK YOU LOOK COMFORTABLE WE HAD MORE MORE POSSESSION
WE DIDN'T HURT MONA AND YOU MISSED BARON RAMSAY DEFINITELY OF COURSE YOU KNOW WITH ARE FANTASTIC PLACE SUITS THE WAY WE PLAY
HE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE MESS BUT WE CAN'T JUST BLAME YOU KNOW HE'S DONE HIS TIME
THIS ONE THOSE THINGS WHERE WE CAN HOLD OUR HANDS UP I CAN'T CRITICISE ANYTHING WE'VE DONE WE DON'T THINK WE'RE COME THIS FAR AND I THINK THE FANS
WE JUST ARE ONE STEP CLOSER TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN THIS NOT THIS
NOT THIS YEAR ANYWAY WELL HIGH OWL ROBSON CARNE THE STRIKER WHO SCORED THAT MAGNIFICENT GOAL AGAINST BELGIUM IN THE PREVIOUS GAME ALSO TOLD ME THAT THE SUPPORTS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE
THEY'VE BEEN FANTASTIC SINCE ITS FIRST BALL'S KICKED IN THIS TOURNAMENT THEY'VE BEEN FULLY BEHIND US THEY'VE BEEN INSPIRATIONAL TO US THEY FOLLOWED US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY WE'RE JUST HOPEFUL DON'T WE WE'VE DONE HIM PROUD
IN ANYWAY DESCRIBE THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE DRESSING ROOM AFTERWARDS COS YOU'VE BEEN SO BUOYANT OBVIOUSLY AFTER EVERY SINGLE OTHER GAME YEAH OF COURSE PROFESSIONALS YOU KNOW NICE SO IT WAS IT WAS DIFFICULT BRAD SAME TIME WE'VE COME A LONG WAY IN THIS TOURNAMENT WILL TAKE A LOT AWAY FROM THIS AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD IN A FUTURE WE CERTAINLY HAVE DONE YOURSELVES PROUD WHAT WILL YOU TAKE AWAY FROM TODAY BECAUSE
CLEARLY HE DIDN'T GO AS WELL AS IT SHOULD HAVE DONE OF COURSE WHEN YOU'RE MISSING KEY PLAYERS AS WELL AT THIS LEVEL AT THIS STAGE YOU CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE SOMETIMES AT THIS LEVEL YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET A RUBBERY
SOMETIMES LOOKED AS THOUGH YOU WERE ALL A LITTLE BIT TIRED KNOW WHO WOULD FORGIVE THAT AFTER THE TOURNAMENT YOU'VE HAD BUT DID IT FEEL LIKE THAT
I THINK BOTH TEAMS RECEIVE FITNESS LEVELS MOTHER I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS A FACTOR OR KNOCK WILL TAKE A LOT AWAY
DID CRISTIANO RONALDO'S PRESENTS I MEAN HE OBVIOUSLY DREW A LOT OF ENERGY
DURING THE GAME WAS IT HIS PRESENCE THAT WAS JUST PERHAPS INTIMIDATING NO I DON'T THINK WE WERE INTIMIDATED AT ALL I THINK THE FIRST HALF WE CONTROLLED THE GAME
IF WE SCORED FIRST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARVESTED A VERY DIFFERENT STORY IN THE END IT WAS A SET PIECE THAT THEY SCORED FROM THEY DIDN'T UNDO US WITH SPECTACULAR PLATE WHERE DO YOU GO NOW
THE ROCK UP EXPECTATIONS NO AGAIN WILL GO INTO IT GIVEN OUR BEST AND GIVEN OUR ALL AS WE ALWAYS DO FOR THE NATION AND HOPEFULLY WILL WE COULD BE SUCCESSFUL AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE CHEERS THANK YOU

RESOLUTION BACKING ACTION YESTERDAY SIR JOHN CHILCOT INQUIRY CONCLUDED MY BLAIR RELIED ON FLAWED INTELLIGENCE AND THERE WAS INADEQUATE PLANNING FOR THE AFTERMATH OF THE CONFLICT

# GREYHOUND RACING IS TO BE BANNED IN NEW SOUTH WALES IN AUSTRALIA FROM NEXT YEAR BECAUSE OF WIDESPREAD CRUELTY THE DECISION FOLLOWS AN INQUIRY WHICH FOUND EVIDENCE OF MASS KILLING OF UNCOMPETITIVE DOGS AND THE USE OF LIVE ANIMALS SUCH AS PIGLETS AND POSSUMS DURING TRAINING SESSIONS
# THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT HOW CRUCIAL WAS BRITAIN TO THE UNITED STATES CALCULATION ABOUT INVADING IRAQ THE CHILCOTT REPORT INCLUDES MEMOS FROM TONY BLAIR TO GEORGE W. BUSH INCLUDING ONE WRITTEN A MONTH AFTER THE NINE ELEVEN ATTACKS SAYING WE NEED TO DEAL WITH SADDAM AT THE TIME DAVID FROM WAS A SPEECHWRITER FOR THE PRESIDENT THE AXIS OF EVIL WAS BASED ON HIS WORK I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE VALUE OF BRITISH SUPPORT IN THE RUN UP TO THE INVASION
BRITAIN WAS OF COURSE HUGELY IMPORTANT AND TONY BLAIR IN PARTICULAR WAS IMPORTANT IT WAS AS AS YOUR REMEMBER GEORGE BUSH HAD COME AND ARTHUR'S UNDER VERY CONTENTIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES CONTESTED RECOUNT AND THERE ARE SOME CLOUDS OVER HIS LEGITIMACY IN THE EYES OF MANY DEMOCRATIC SENATOR AS MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE
TONY BLAIR OUT OF SIDE WAS SOMETHING THAT STRENGTHENED THE COALITION OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IT SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE IN A RACK GEORGE
WHAT DID PUT TOGETHER A VERY PRACTICAL LITTLE COALITION OF HOW LONG THE RECALL AND JOHN KERRY LET'S ALL RECALL BOTH WERE ORDERED TO EVA OF THE MEASURES ARTS RACEHORSE IN IRAQ AND TONY BLAIR'S SUPPORT WAS IMPORTANT BY JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND TWO MONTHS AFTER NINE ELEVEN ATTACKS THE PHRASE AXIS OF EVIL WITCH AN AXIS THAT INCLUDED IRAQ WAS IN PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH THAT WAS A PHRASE THAT YOU COINED WHY
IN THOSE EARLY MONTHS AFTER THE NINE ELEVEN ATTACKS DID YOU PUT IRAQ IN THAT BRACKET I SPEAK
WHICH LISTED POSSIBLE THINGS ONE MIGHT SAY SPEECH RIDERS DO NOT MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHICH COUNTRY'S SIX IS GOING TO GO TO WAR WITH BUT THE MEMO THING YOU PUT IN SAID OR DID IT NOT IRAN IRAQ
AND HEZBOLLAH WERE ALL PART OF AN AXIS OF HATRED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES YES WELL IN THE END THE AXIS OF EVIL PHRASE WAS IRAN IRAQ AND NORTH KOREA AND THEY WERE POSED AS A THREAT WHEN YOU WROTE ABOUT THEM AS PART OF AN AXIS OF HATRED YOU SEE IRAQ AS A THREAT
OR JUST ALSO HATRED FOR SURE THESE WERE POTENTIAL THREATS ORAC AND BRITAIN HAD FOUGHT A WAR TO ACT NINETEEN NINETY ONE A DARINGLY GONE TO WAR AGAIN IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THERE A DEN I'M GOING CLASHES IN THE ELDERS DICK AIR CAMPAIGN IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND ALL OF THIS WAS INCONCLUSIVE BUT THAT IS STILL QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE PERCEPTION OF IRAQ AT THE TIME IN THE WAY THAT THE CASE FOR WAR WAS MADE THAT IT WAS AN IMMINENT THREAT BECAUSE OF THESE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
TO THE WEST WE NOW KNOW THAT THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WERE NOT THERE THE SECURITY AGENCIES GOING TOTALLY TAKEN SEES WHAT ABOUT THAT DO YOU BELIEVE ARE GOING TO WAR WAS THE RIGHT DECISION HOW DO I KNOW THERE ARE NO WHAT WAS A DESTRUCT NASH DESTRUCTION I WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T DO HUMANITARIAN WARTS I DON'T THINK WE'VE GOT
BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO DO AS WE ARE AWARE OF THE CAST OF THE WAR WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THE COST OF YOUR TURNIPS HAD WE NOT GOD WAS THERE SOME PRETTY BAD THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE
THIS HUGE SURGE AND OIL PRICES AFRICAN DOESN'T WORK I WAS COMING ANYWAY BECAUSE CHINESE ECONOMIC EXPERIENCE SO WITHOUT THE IRAQ WE HAVE TO HAVE A SITUATION TWO THOUSAND OR TWO THOUSAND FIVE TWO THOUSAND SEX WITH SADDAM SYNGE WHICH I WHITNEY WAS LARGELY FREE OF THE SANCTIONS IN RICKY WAS IMPORTANT ACT THERE YOU TWEAK THE U.S. U.K. INTERVENTION OFFERED IRAQ A BETTER FUTURE WHATEVER THE WEST PACIFIC SECTARIAN WAR WAS A CHOICE IRAQIS MADE FOR THEMSELVES REALLY YES
YES REALLY WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE BAD PLANNING ALL OF THAT THAT WHEN THAT REGIME THAT OPPRESSIVE AND VICIOUS REGIME FELT THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WORK TO BUILD A BIGGER OR BETTER FUTURE IT WAS NOT DETERMINED BY THE UNITED STATES THERE WAS A MILITARY AND THERE WAS A MILITARY AND POLITICAL AND SECURITY VACUUM THAT WAS CREATED
BY THE INVASION AND SAUTE NORTHERN CERTAINLY IN THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS AND TO SAY IT WAS THE IRAQIS WHO DID IT TO EACH OTHER IS I MEAN HE'S AN DISINGENUOUS
NO IT'S THE FACT IT WAS NOT GOING TO SIX TO SET I THERE WASN'T ABOUT HIM THEY'RE WORTH ALREADY SO WHAT DOES THE DISBANDING OF THE IRAQI ARMY BUT IT WAS NOT AMERICANS WHO SAID WHY DON'T YOU GO TAKE A POWER TOOL TO GRILL IT AND THE HEAD OF YOUR NEIGHBOUR
PEOPLE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE MADE THE DECISION TO TORTURE TO KILL A SET OF CAR BOMBS THEY MADE THOSE DECISIONS THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ELSE WE COULD HAVE FORMED A POLITICAL SYSTEM
THEY COULD'VE UNITED THEY COULDN'T EVEN SECOND A WE AS SHIITES AND SOUNESS AND CURVES WE REJECT THE AMERICANS THE BRITISH AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER THAT'S NOT WHAT HER THEIR COUNTRY HAD BEEN RIPPED APART BY INVASION THEIR ARMY HAS BEEN DISBANDED ENTIRELY BY THE AMERICANS IRAQ IRAN REARING REARING ITS HEAD ANY GET AND EXCEEDING ITS KERB ARMS AND THE DOUBT ANOTHER RETURN WHY DO THEY HAVE TO DO THAT SAID WHEN YOU LOOK AT IRAQ TODAY YOU DON'T FEEL ANY SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR
FOR SETTING A COURSE OF EVENTS IN INTO ACTION I DON'T ACCEPT THE VIEW THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS FROM HER WORLD IS THE CULT OF BEING OUT STOPS AND EVEN WHEN AMERICAN MAKE MISTAKES THE OSPREY OPPORTUNITIES AND THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER FUTURE FOR HER WORK WHY THAT WASN'T SEATS IS A STORY THAT ISN'T AS ASHLEY MORE ABOUT ORAC IS ABOUT GOING OUT IT'S DAVID FROM FORMER SPEECH WRITER FOR PRESIDENT BUSH
# TWENTY TO EIGHT NOW THERE MAY BE A RAY OF HOPE FOR SOME WORKERS THAT WORKS AROUND THE COUNTRY THE COMPANY'S GOING TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF SIMON YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS WELL SETI JAVID BUSINESS SECRETARY ON HIS WAY TO MUMBAI TO MEET THE CHAIRMAN SARRIS MYSTERY BEFORE A BOARD MEETING THERE AND I EXPECT TO THINGS TO HAPPEN THE FIRST IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT THEY ARE GOING TO SELL OFF SOME OF THEIR SPECIALTY BUSINESSES NOW THIS IS GOOD NEWS
FOR AROUND TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE IN STOCKSBRIDGE ROTHERHAM AND SOME OF THE WORKFORCE AT HARTLEPOOL THEY'RE CONFIDENT THEY CAN FIND A BUYER FOR THAT BUSINESS AND THE SECOND PART WILL BE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO FURTHER DELAY WHAT THE DECISION ON WHAT TO DO WITH THE REST THE BULK OF THEIR BUSINESS WHICH IS OF COURSE ALL THOSE PORT TALBOT EXACTLY THAN THE FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE
ALONE NOW THE DELAY WILL BE NOMINATED YOU THROUGH THINGS ONE ASSESS THE IMPACT OF BRIGGS IT WHILE I MULL THAT OVER AND SECONDLY TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S ANY RESULT ON WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THE PENSION FUND REMEMBER THIS IS THE BIG CITY WASN'T HE HAD A BIT OF BRITISH STILL PENSION OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS ARE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUND DEFICIT SUDSY JAVID ANNOUNCED THE CONSULTATION HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A ONE OFF LAW
TO BASICALLY REDUCE THOSE BENEFITS TO MAKE IT MORE MANAGEABLE AND MAKE IT PALATABLE TO SOME OF THE BIDDERS NOW THERE ARE SEVEN BIDDERS OUT THERE NONE OF THEM WANT THAT PENSION PLAN THERE ARE THREE OPTIONS ON THE PENSION PLAN THIS SECTION SIXTY SEVEN AS SUCH BUT CALL IT WHICH IS TO CHANGE IT IN LAW TO REDUCE THOSE BENEFITS
THERE'S ALWAYS THE P. P. F. THAT PENSIONS LIFEBOAT FUND AND THERE'S A THIRD OPTION WHICH ONE OF THE BIDDERS IS KEEN TO PROMOTE WHICH IS CALLED THE KODAK OPTION WHICH LITERALLY MEANS GOING ROUND ALL THE INDIVIDUAL
BENEFICIARIES OF THAT SCHEME AND SAYING WOULD YOU MIND SIGNING UP TO SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT BUT AS WE SPEAK THOSE OPTIONS THOSE BIDS I SHOULD SAY REALLY ARE STILL LIVE THERE STILL LIVE THE TARTAR REMEMBER IT WAS IN A TERRIBLE HURRY SO WE WANT TO GET SHOT OF THIS THIS IS LOSING A MILLION POUNDS A DAY HAVE SOUGHT TO SOFT PEDAL A LITTLE BIT ON THIS WHOLE PROCESS NOW PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE THE BUSINESS HE'S GOT BETTER STEEL PRICES HAVE GONE UP SO THEY'RE NOT LOSING QUITE SO MUCH MONEY
AND THE BIDDERS ARE GETTING PRETTY CHEESED OFF WITH TARSUS DELAY ON ALL OF THIS AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT IT SUITS TARTARE TO SOFT PEDAL THIS WHOLE PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'VE TURNED THEIR FOCUS TO EUROPE WHERE THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF MERGING OR LOOKING IN A MERGER WITH DECENT CROP THE BIG GERMAN INDUSTRIALISTS THEY'RE SAYING IT SUITS THEM TO LEAVE THIS TO WITHER ON THE VINE IN THE VERY WORDS OF ONE BIDDER WHILE I FOCUS ON EUROPE AND THE BIDDERS ARE GETTING CHEESED OFF NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE GETTING CLOSER TO ANSWERS ON THEIR FUTURE SIMON THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIMON JACK AREN'T BUSINESS EDDIE
# THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES RATE LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND TONY BLAIR APPEARS ON ALL THE FRONT PAGES THIS MORNING AS THEY REPORT EXTENSIVELY ON THE CHILCOT INQUIRY THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS THE REVELATION IN THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER TOLD PRESIDENT BUSH I'LL BE WITH YOU WHATEVER SHOWS THAT HE WAS SECRETLY PLOTTING AN INVASION OF IRAQ WITH THE UNITED STATES THE MIRROR BELIEVES THE MEMOS MISTER BLAIR WROTE TO MISTER BUSH SHOW THAT HE HAD A SLAVISH DEVOTION TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT
FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH I'LL BE WITH YOU WHATEVER WERE WORDS THAT SET BRITAIN ON THE PATH TO WAR THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER MAY HAVE FOLLOWED THIS WITH SOME CAVEATS BUT HIS EPITAPH IS WRITTEN IN THESE WORDS THE GUARDIAN SAYS WHAT FLOWED FROM THE PRIVATE PROMISE WAS A PERVASIVE POISON A SENSE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT PLAYING IT STRAIGHT ACCUSES MISTER BLAIR OF SAYING ONE THING QUIETLY TO MY BUSH WHILE KEEPING MANY OF HIS MINISTERS AND MILITARY COMMANDERS IN THE DARK REGARDING THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT AS THE BOSS
RATHER THAN THE BRITISH PEOPLE THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE INQUIRY HAS MAULED MY BLAIR'S REPUTATION THE DAILY MAIL ON ITS FRONT PAGE CALLED HIM A MONSTER OF DELUSION FOR STANDING BY HIS DECISION TO SEND SOLDIERS INTO BATTLE WHEN HE GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY
MY REFUSAL TO SAY SORRY FOR THIS AND HIS INSISTENCE THAT HE DO IT AGAIN REPRESENTS A SICKENING EAGER MANIA ON HIS PART THE MAIL COLUMNIST QUENTIN LETTS AS THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER PRESENTED HIMSELF AS SOME SORT OF RESTLESS PENITENT WHO PLEADED TO BE BELIEVED BEGGING HIS COUNTRY TO ACCEPT THAT HE HAD NOT LIED BLAIR'S PRIVATE WAR IS THE MAIN HEADLINE IN THE TIMES OF THINKS THE BOMBER PRIME MINISTER'S BEEN CRUSHED BY CHILCOT WITHERING VERDICT
PEOPLE'S POLITICAL SKETCH WRITER PATRICK COULD COMMENT ON MY DEFENCE OF THE INVASION THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH SPURTED CONSTANTLY HORNED HIM THIS IS A MAN WRITES MY KID WHO FELT SINCERE BUT HIS INSISTENCE THAT HE WAS RIGHT IS DRIVING HIM MAD THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
# WELL THE DREAM DIED LAST NIGHT OR DID IT WHALES ARE GOING TO BE TAKING HOME THE TROPHY AT THE END OF THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS BUT PRETTY SOON QUALIFYING BEGINS FOR THE NEXT WORLD CUP IN TWO YEARS' TIME OF THE FANS WHO SAW THEIR TEAM LOSE TWO NIL TO PORTUGAL LAST NIGHT WAS STILL IN GOOD HARD AND GOOD VOICE AT OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICE WAS WITH THEM
I'VE GOT ONE OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS OF THE WORLD AND POSSIBLY THE GREATEST YOUNGEST PLAYER
KIND OF I'M CONFIDENT IS THAT WEIRD THE ATMOSPHERE IS BUILDING HERE NOW UNDER THE SHADOW
FANS OF THE STADIUM IT'S HARD TO DISTINGUISH THE WELSH OF THE PORTUGUESE FANS EVERYBODY'S DRESSED IN
HI I'M MATTHEW WHAT'S YOUR NAME SCOTT HOW OLD ARE YOU SCOTT WHAT DO YOU THINK

STOP WHINING YOU'VE GOT TO GO YOU HAVE TO GO OFF TO
NOT MUCH HAPPENING I THINK THEY'RE A BIT RESERVED HOLDING BACK AND HOPEFULLY HE'LL OPEN UP IN A SEC
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE TEAM PERFORMANCE IN THE TOURNAMENT ARE SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF IT'S DISAPPOINTING
WE'RE GOING TO BE A BETTER TEAM FOR IT GUTTED I WOULD REALLY BRING PROUD SO IT ALL HERE
# WALES FANS SPEAKING TO MATTHEW PRICE OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT IN LYON LAST NIGHT AT THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN A GLASGOW STUDIO THIS MORNING IS MONA SIDDIQUI PROFESSOR OF ISLAMIC STUDIES AT NEW COLLEGE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
AS A LONG FAST OF RAMADAN AND WITH AID I ALMOST HESITATE TO USE THE WORD CELEBRATE THIS YEAR IT'S BEEN A TERRIBLE FEW DAYS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN WHICH SO MANY HAVE DIED
VIOLENCE IN THE CAFE YOU TUCKER ISTANBUL AIRPORT AND THE BUSY SHOPPING STREETS OF BAGHDAD HAVE KILLED HUNDREDS
AND THEN THE MOST RECENT ATTACKS IN MEDINA ISLAM SECOND HOLIEST CITY HAVE LEFT MANY MUSLIM AS WONDERING WHETHER ANYTHING REMAIN SACRED FOR THE JIHADISTS
IN AROUND TEN WEEKS' TIME PILGRIMS WILL BE TRAVELLING TO MECCA FOR THE ANNUAL HATCH PILGRIMAGE NO DOUBT THE SAUDIS WERE STEP UP SECURITY BUT THE QUESTION MANY WILL BE ASKING IS WHERE NEXT WILL THE KABIR IN METAL ITSELF BE A TARGET
IN THE ERA OF HASH TAGS ENCAPSULATING A PEOPLE'S MORNING OR SOLIDARITY THERE ARE PRAYER HASHTAG SAW ALL THESE PLACES BUT ONE OF THE MOST POIGNANT COMMENTS I READ AFTER THE TRAGEDY IN BAGHDAD WAS THAT PEOPLE CAME TO BUY CLOTHES TO CELEBRATE EAT NOW THEY'RE BUYING COFFINS
THERE IS A SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS AND NUMBNESS ALMOST BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT SO USED TO HEARING ABOUT THE SPREAD OF SPORADIC AND BRUTAL VIOLENCE IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES
BUT THE ATTACK ON MEDINA THE BURIAL PLACE OF THE PROPHET THE PLACE WHERE ISLAM EMERGED FROM A SMALL COMMUNITY OF BELIEVERS HAS BEEN SEEN AS AN ATTACK ON THE VERY SOUL OF ISLAM
THE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE INVASION OF IRAQ LED TO MANY THOUSANDS OF DEATHS IRAQ AND ITS NEIGHBOURING REGIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THE RAVAGES ABOUT IDA AND ISIS
BUT THE REGION OFTEN REFERRED TO AS HUMANITY'S CRADLE OF CIVILISATION HAS BEEN HOME TO SUCCESSIVE CIVILISATIONS SINCE HER SIXTH MILLENNIUM B.C. THIS IS ITS PROUD HISTORY DESPITE ITS CURRENT DIVIDED AND WAR TORN STATUS
YESTERDAY WE HAD MANY THINGS IN THE LONGER WAY TO CHILCOTT REPORT BUT IN ALL THE HEART RENDING ACCOUNTS FROM THE RELATIVES OF THOSE WHO HAD LOST LOVED ONES THE SENSE OF INJUSTICE REMAINED INJUSTICE AT THE LOSS OF BOTH BRITISH AND IRAQI LIVES WHATEVER THE INTENTIONS THE WARHEAD DESTROYED IRAQ RATHER THAN RESTORE HOPE
BUT AID IS ABOUT HOPE AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MUSLIMS SHOULD COME TOGETHER IN SOLIDARITY TO CELEBRATE RATHER THAN MERELY MOURN THESE ICONIC CITIES OF BAGHDAD ISTANBUL AND MEDINA
SIMPLY BEING WITH ONE ANOTHER IN DEFIANT AND SOLIDARITY AS FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND ACROSS CULTURES SHOWS RESILIENCE NOT INDIFFERENT TO SUFFERING
THESE CITIES GAVE BIRTH TO SOME OF OUR GREATEST CIVILISATIONS AND HOWEVER MUCH OF A CANCER TERRORISM HAS NOW BECOME IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD IT MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO DIMINISH THEIR HISTORY OR THEIR GRANDEUR
THAT WAS THOUGHT OF THE DAY WITH MONA SIDDIQI THE TIME IS TEMPLATE
# BY THE END OF THE DAY THEY'LL BE TOO CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CANDIDATES LEFT IN THE RUNNING AFTER ANOTHER ROUND OF VOTING BY TORY M.P.S THERESA MAY ANDREA LEAD SOME AND MICHAEL GO REMAIN IN THE RACE BUT ONLY TWO CAN GO THROUGH TO THE FINAL STAGE INVOLVING A BALLET OF CONSERVATIVE PARTY MEMBERS AND WAS TO GO TO CAMPAIGN MANAGER HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING FELLOW M.P.S TO VOTE FOR HIM EVEN IF THEY ULTIMATELY WANT MISSUS MAY AS PRIME MINISTER IN ORDER TO PUSH MISSUS LED SOME OUT
THE PARTY WAS LED FROM TWO THOUSAND THREE TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE BY MICHAEL HOWARD NOW LORD HOWARD WHO'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING LORD HOWARD IN WHICH OF THE THREE DO YOU WANT TO SEE AS A PRIME MINISTER
I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ANDREA LETS THEM IS BEST PLACED TO LEAD A COUNTRY INTO THIS EXCITING NEW FUTURE THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION SHE HAS THE VISION TO TO SEE THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH THEY'RE OUT THERE IN FRONT OF US
I THINK IT WOULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO HAVE A PRIME MINISTER WHO WAS VOTED WITH THE MINORITY RATHER THE MAJORITY OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE IN THAT MOMENTOUS FETE TWO WEEKS AGO ANDREA STARTED THE FRESH START GROUPING IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SOME YEARS AGO PROBABLY KNOWS AS MUCH IF NOT MORE ABOUT EUROPE
THAN ANY OTHER M. P. AND SHE'S THE PERSON I THINK TO GIVE US A FRESH START IN THIS EXCITING NEW FUTURE THAT LIES BEFORE US ARE YOU NOT CONCERNED ABOUT HER LACK OF EXPERIENCE NO CABINET EXPERIENCE I MEAN EVEN HER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE CITY WHICH HE TALKS ABOUT ROB RATHER A LOT
LOOKING LESS IMPRESSIVE THE MORE DETAILS THAT EMERGE ABOUT NET THERE AT THAT THERE I DON'T THINK THE EXPERIENCES IS HUGELY IMPORTANT DAVID CAMERON BUT EVEN PRIME MINISTER YES HE'D NEVER BEEN IN GOVERNMENT WHEN HE WAS ELECTED IN A GENERAL ELECTION BY THE PEEP YES BUT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN GOVERNMENT BEFORE HE BECAME PRIME MINISTER THERE ARE CLIMB MENTION TO OTHER THINGS WHICH REALLY ENTHUSED ME ABOUT ABOUT ANDREA FIRST
FIRST OF ALL I'M IMPRESSED BY WHAT SHE'S DONE SHE FOUNDED THIS PARENT INFANT CHARITY FOR THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN A SOCIETY WHICH I THINK DEMONSTRATES A PRACTICAL COMMITMENT WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT AND I MUST ALSO MENTION SOMETHING WHICH HAS CAUSED ME GREAT DISTRESS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS
SHE HAS MADE A CLEAR COMMITMENT TO THE MILLIONS OF E.U. CITIZENS AND YOU A COUNTRY HERO LAWFULLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM DECENT HARDWORKING PEOPLE SHE HAS MADE A CLEAR COMMITMENT THAT THEY CAN STAY HERE AND I AM DISMAYED BY THE FACT THAT THE HOME OFFICE
REGARD THESE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AS BARGAINING CHIPS IN A NEGOTIATION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION SO HAS MICHAEL GO MADE THAT COMMITMENT HE WAS ALSO ON THE SIDE THAT YOU BACKED THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SIDE IN THE REFERENDUM SET AND HE HAS CONSIDERABLE CABINET EXPERIENCE AS EDUCATION SECRETARY NOW AS JUST A SECRETARY WHY NOT MICHAEL GO I THINK I THINK HIGH REGARD FOR FOR MICHAEL I THINK HE WAS AN EXTREMELY GOOD EDUCATION SECRETARY
BUT I'M AFRAID THAT THE EVENTS OF LAST WEEK MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT I'M AFRAID TO TO SUPPORT HIM AND THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN COMPOUNDED BY THE TEXT WHICH YOU REFERRED IN YOUR EARLIER IN YOUR PROGRAMME THIS IS THE TEXT THAT WAS SENT OUT BY NICK BOLES HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER ASKING FELLOW M.P.S TO TO TO VOTE FOR HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT ANDREW LETS AND WAS KEPT OFF THE OFF THE FINAL TWO
BUT IT DOES REVEAL THOUGH THAT WHAT NICK SAID AS THAT IS I'M SERIOUSLY FRIGHTENED ABOUT THE RISK OF ALLOWING ANDREA LEAD SOME ONTO THE MEMBERSHIP BALLET ARE WE REALLY CONFIDENT THAT THEIR MEMBERSHIP WON'T VOTE FOR A FRESH FACE WHO SHARES THEIR ATTITUDES ABOUT MUCH OF MODERN LIFE
IT WOULD BE A RISK WOULD IT NOT TO PUT SOMEONE WITH SO LITTLE EXPERIENCE OF GOVERNMENT INTO THIS TOP WOULDN'T WE HAVE TO HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION CERTAINLY NOT NO WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION INDEED IT'S NOT EASY TO SEE HOW WE CAN HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION BECAUSE WE HAVE A LAW
WHICH PUTS IN PLACE FIXED TERM PARLIAMENT SO YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE SOME CONTRIVED MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE WOULD YOU GET ON AND YOU DID GET IT THROUGH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHERE YOU DO IT THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT WE'VE GOT A LAW FIXED TERM PARLIAMENTS THAT SHOULD STAY IN PLACE FOR THE MOMENT ANYWAY I SHOULD STAY IN PLACE FOR THE REST OF THIS PARLIAMENT SHE'S BEEN IN GOVERNMENT SHE'S IN TUNE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY
SHE KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS THE EXCITING FUTURE THAT LIES AHEAD OF US THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK SHE WOULD BE AN EXTREMELY GOOD PRIME MINISTER EVEN THOUGH SHE'S UNTESTED I MEAN PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EVEN SOME OF HER FELLOW M.P.S WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN WHO SHE WAS BEFORE THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THAT SHE'S BEEN IN GOVERNMENT SHE UNDERSTANDS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION EXTREMELY WELL I WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPRESSED WITH THE CONTRIBUTION SHE MADE IN THE DEBATES WE HAD OVER THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WHETHER WE SHOULD WITHDRAW
I THINK SHE'S THE RIGHT PERSON BUT HAD IT NOT BEEN FULL FOR THE WHAT YOU SAID WHAT YOU RECALL THE EVENTS OF LAST WEEK AND PARTICULARLY I THINK YOU MEAN THE THE DRAMA BETWEEN BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTING HIM HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT I WOULD FIND I WOULD HAVE FOUND IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT DECISION HAD THOSE EVENTS NOT HAPPENED
# BUT THEY DID AND WE ARE WHERE WE ARE O.K. SO YOU ARE NOW SUPPORTING AND ANDREA LET'S IN A BALLET TAKES PLACE TODAY WE'RE TALKING OF COURSE THE MORNING AFTER THAT THE CHILCOTT REPORT HAVING SEEN THE VERDICT AND YOU WERE THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR YOU AN OPPOSITION AT THE TIME OF THE INVASION
WHAT ARE YOUR REFLECTIONS ON ON THE VOTE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AT THAT TIME BECAUSE TONY BLAIR COULD NOT HAVE GOT THROUGH THAT FATE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SUPPORT OF YOU AND OTHER CONSERVATIVE M.P.S WHO OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED FOR THE WAR
LET ME BEGIN BY IT BY EXPRESSING MY MY PROFOUND SYMPATHY WITH WITH THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES AND WITH THOSE WHO WERE INJURED AND WOUNDED IN THE CONFLICT AND YES I DATED FOR THE WARNED I MUST ACCEPT MY SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY
I THINK THAT SIR JOHN TO CORN AND HIS TEAM HAVE DONE A VERY THOROUGH AND METICULOUS JOB IN LAYING BARE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MOST DISASTROUS DECISION THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS TAKEN FOR MANY YEARS AND
I THINK WE WERE GIVEN AN EXAGGERATED ACCOUNT OF THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH I THINK WEIGHED HEAVILY WITH MANY PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR THE WAR IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AT THAT TIME YOU THEREFORE REGRET ON THE WAY YOU VOTED I DO OF COURSE I DO I THINK THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN UTTERLY DISASTROUS THAT THAT DECISION HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOSS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES
AND THERE IS I I BELIEVE IN PART RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TERRIBLE SITUATION WE FACE IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD TODAY IT'S COARSE IT'S NOT HOLY RESPONSIBLE FOR IT BUT I THINK IT WAS A FACTOR AND CERTAINLY I DON'T THINK I DON'T QUITE SEE HOW ANYWAY
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE NOW COULD HAVE VOTED FOR THAT MOTION BECAUSE THE NATION WAS FULL OF REFERENCES TO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND TONY KNOW STANDS BY THE DECISION TO GO TO WAR WELL THAT'S THAT ABOUT THAT SOMETHING THAT HE HE WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT I I TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW
YOU WERE JUST BRIEFLY EARLIER THIS WEEK WE BUT LORD BUTLER CAME ON ON THE PROGRAMME WHO MENTIONED YOU AND IN THE CONTEXT OF EVENTS AT THE TIME YES THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THAT RIGHT LORD BUTLER SAID THAT I WAS ASKED DURING THE DEBATE ON HIS REPORT WHETHER I WAS ACCUSING TONY BLAIR OR MISLEADING THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND HE SAID HAD I GIVEN A DIFFERENT ANSWER THINGS MIGHT HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY BUT I WAS NEVER ACTUALLY ASKED THAT QUESTION I'VE CHECKED OUTSIDE I WAS NEVER ASKED THAT QUESTION
# AND I DON'T THINK ANYTHING I SAID WOULD'VE MADE THINGS DIFFERENT BECAUSE TONY BLAIR HAD A VERY LARGE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY AT THE TIME LORD HOWARD MICHAEL HOWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT THE WEATHER FORECAST HOLICS THANKS FROM THIS JOHN GOOD MORNING NOT QUITE AS CHILLY OUT THERE THIS MORNING MOSTLY THANKS TO MUCH MORE CLOUD AROUND THE DETAILS FOR TODAY'S SPLIT INTO THREE AREAS I'LL START WITH SOUTH EAST ENGLAND AND EASTERN ENGLAND GENERALLY OVERCAST FIRST THING THIS MORNING THERE ARE A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS DRIFTING BY BUT THEY'RE TENDING TO FADE

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE SEVENTH OF JULY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING SENIOR FIGURES CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH BRITAIN'S DECISION TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ SAY THE UNITED STATES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT FOLLOWED THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST WILL BE REDUCED TO TWO CANDIDATES TODAY AMID SIGNS OF FURTHER SQUABBLING WITHIN THE PARTY
AND WALES ARE HEADING HOME FROM EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN AFTER BEING DEFEATED BY PORTUGAL THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY NEIL SLEET SENIOR FIGURES AT THE HEART OF BRITAIN'S DECISION TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HAVE RESPONDED TO THE CHILCOT INQUIRY BY BLAMING THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT FOLLOWED
YESTERDAY SIR JOHN CHILCOT DELIVERED A SCATHING CRITIQUE OF THE WAY TONY BLAIR'S GOVERNMENT ACTED CONCLUDING THAT IT RELIED ON FLAWED INTELLIGENCE HIS REPORT ALSO FOUND THAT THERE WAS INADEQUATE PLANNING FOR THE AFTERMATH OF THE CONFLICT IS A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE
THE CHILCOT REPORTERS OPENED OLD WOUNDS ABOUT WHO DECIDED WHARTON WHEN IN THE RUN UP TO WAR IN TWO THOUSAND THREE SIR JEREMY GREEN STOCK BRITAIN'S AMBASSADOR AT THE TIME TOLD WELL TONIGHT TO THE UNITED STATES PUSHED THE U.K. INTO MILITARY ACTION TOO EARLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH SAFER HE SAID TO GIVE THE U.N. INSPECTORS ANOTHER SIX MONTHS TO LOOK FOR CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS IN IRAQ
AND HE TOLD NEWSNIGHT THAT THE U.S. DID NOT REALLY WANT A SECOND U.N. RESOLUTION TO JUSTIFY WAR THE AMERICANS WERE GENUINE ABOUT IT BUT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS GENUINE ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT SADDAM COULD BE MADE TO BACK DOWN
BEFORE WE HAD TO USE MILITARY FORCE AND GEORGE BUSH FOR A WHILE AGREED WITH HIM BUT OTHER PEOPLE BEHIND GEORGE BUSH DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM AND THOUGHT IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME
THOSE PEOPLE INCLUDED THE U.S. DEFENCE SECRETARY DONALD TRUMP'S FELT GENERAL TIM CROSS THE MOST SENIOR BRITISH OFFICER INVOLVED IN PLANNING THE WAR SO MY ROOMS FILLED WOULD NOT LISTEN EITHER TO THE U.N. THE U.K. OR EVEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE AFTERMATH OF THE INVASION AND AS A RESULT IRAQ'S ARMY WAS DISBANDED AND THE BA'ATH PARTY REDUCED WITHOUT CONSULTATION
TONY BLAIR'S FORMER HEAD OF COMMUNICATIONS ALASTAIR CAMPBELL TOLD NEWSNIGHT THAT THE AMERICANS DIDN'T DELIVER AS MUCH AFTER THE WAR AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE
THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT HAS NO INTENTION OF RE EXAMINING THE WAY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION APPROACHED THE IRAQ WAR IN LIGHT OF THE CHILCOTT REPORT A SPOKESMAN SAID THE FOCUS WAS ON DEFEATING ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA NOT ON ANALYSING DECISIONS MADE THIRTEEN YEARS AGO
DAVID FROM WHO WAS A SPEECH WRITER FOR PRESIDENT BUSH TOLD THIS PROGRAMME IT WAS UNFAIR TO BLAME HIS COUNTRY FOR THE VIOLENCE IN IRAQ SINCE THE CONFLICT
IT WAS NOT OUR CUNTS WHO SAID WHY DON'T YOU GO TAKE A POWER TOOL AND GRILL AND THE HEAD OF YOUR NEIGHBOUR PEOPLE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE MADE THE DECISION TO TORTURE TO KILL A SET OF CAR BOMBS THEY MADE THOSE DECISIONS THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ELSE THEY COULD HAVE FORMED A POLITICAL SYSTEM THEY COULD'VE UNITED THEY COULD HAVE EVEN SAID WE AS SHIITES AND SOON HIS INCREMENTS WE REJECT THE AMERICANS AND THE BRITISH I WANT TO WORK TOGETHER BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT

HER C.V. LISTING THE POST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DIRECTOR AT BARCLAYS LATER ADDED THE WORD DEPUTY AND INNOCENT ERROR ACCORDING TO TEAM LEAD SOME AND THE M.P. HAD BOASTED OF A HIGH POWER BACKGROUND HAD MERELY BEEN BIGGING HER UP MAYBE SO BUT THE CONTEST WILL BE MERCILESS THE FIGHT FOR THE TOP JOB IN POLITICS ALWAYS IS IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER LORD HOWARD TOLD THIS PROGRAMME HE WOULD BE SUPPORTING ANDREA LED SOME
# M.P.S HAVE EXPRESSED SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S PREFERRED CANDIDATE TO BECOME THE NEXT HEAD OF THE SCHOOL'S REGULATOR OFF STEAD THE EDUCATION SELECT COMMITTEE SAID THAT AMANDA SPELMAN HAD FAILED TO SHOW PASSION FOR THE ROLE AND DIDN'T FEEL THE BUCK STOPPED WITH OFSTED ON CHILD PROTECTION THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT MIZ SPELMAN IS DUE TO TAKE OVER FROM SIR MICHAEL WILSHAW AT THE END OF THE YEAR HAD A PROVEN TRACK RECORD AS A LEADER
THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. NEIL CARMICHAEL QUESTION BUT SPELMAN AND TOLD US THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE UP TO THE JOB HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A CLEAR VISION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OFFSET IT IS ALSO NECESSARY EFFECTIVELY WOULD TO BE A CHAMPION OF IMPROVING STANDARDS WE DO NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF CRUSADING VIEW FROM DID THE CHIEF INSPECTOR AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS LACKING IN SO THAT ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO WERE THERE
# TWO CHILDREN AGED TWO AND THREE HAVE DIED AFTER A CAR CRASHED INTO A LOCH NEAR OBAN IN ARGYLL YESTERDAY AFTERNOON A WOMAN WAS RESCUED
# INDIA'S TATA STEEL IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE TOMORROW THAT WILL POSTPONE THE SALE OF MOST OF ITS U.K. OPERATIONS INCLUDING PORT TALBOT IT WILL PROCEED WITH THE SALE OF ITS SPECIALITY STILL MAKING OPERATIONS WHICH EMPLOYS TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES CAN HARDLY PULL UM AND STOCKSBRIDGE MORE DETAILS FROM OUR BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK
BUSINESS SECRETARY SERGEY JAVID WILL FLY TO MUMBAI TONIGHT TO MEET TATA CHAIRMAN CYRUS MYSTERY AHEAD OF A BOARD MEETING AND WHICH IS EXPECTED TATA WILL ANNOUNCE ITS SELLING OFF ITS SPECIALTY STEEL BUSINESS THAT WILL HELP SECURE THE FUTURE OF SOME OF THE TWO THOUSAND WORKERS IN STOCKSBRIDGE ROTHERHAM AND HARTLEPOOL HOWEVER THE FUTURE OF ANOTHER NINE THOUSAND WILL BE FURTHER DELAYED AS TATA ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF BRIGGS IT
AND WAITS FOR THE RESULT OF GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF THE OLD BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME BY REDUCING BENEFITS TO MANY OF ITS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS THERE ARE SEVERAL ACTIVE BIDS FOR THE BUSINESS BUT NONE OF THEM WANT TO TAKE ON THE SCHEME AS IT STANDS
# WHALES HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT OF THE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN TOURNAMENT IN LYON BY PORTUGAL THE SEMI FINAL MATCH WAS DESCRIBED AS THE BIGGEST IN WELSH HISTORY BUT TWO GOALS IN TWO MINUTES IN THE SECOND HALF BY CRISTIANO RONALDO OR NANI ENDED THEIR HOPES OF FANS THE MANAGER OF WALES CHRIS COLEMAN EXPRESSED PRIDE IN THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS TEAM
YOU'RE ALWAYS HURT AND EXPECTED HURT THIS MUCH HOUSE MY SLEDGES TOLD THEM THEY SHOULD BE PROUD OF THEMSELVES THE NATION'S PROUD OF THEM THE SOYA TONIGHT BUT I THINK WHEN IT SUBSIDES THE LOOK BACK THEY SHOULD KNOW I WHAT HOW WELL HE'D DONE FOR THEIR COUNTRY BUT THESE FANS OUTSIDE THE GROUND IN LYON WERE MOSTLY FAR FROM DISAPPOINTED
IF ANYONE HAD SAID YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO THE SEMI FINALS OF THE START OF THE TOURNAMENT WE DO A SNAPPY RUNS OFF THE ADVENTURE IS OVER BUT I DO
DO YOU SUCH A GREAT TIME GAY PROUD OF BOYS DID A GREAT JOB GREAT RESULT AS FAR AS IT IS IS A PIECE OF HISTORY BUT THE SWING TO STOP WE WERE SECOND BEST UNFORTUNATELY BUT I THINK WE WERE WINNERS OF THE TOURNAMENT
# MARKS AND SPENCER'S SAYS IT EXPERIENCED AN EIGHT POINT NINE PERCENT FALL IN CLOTHING SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR THE RETAILER SAID THE SLUMP IN THE THREE MONTHS TO THE START OF JULY IT WAS WORSE THAN EXPECTED
# THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE PURPOSE OF THE CHILCOT INQUIRY WAS NOT TO APPORTION BLAME IT WAS TO POINT TO LESSONS THAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM THAT CATASTROPHIC WAR BUT IN THE END IT COMES DOWN TO THE SAME THING
YOU CANNOT LEARN LESSONS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT MISTAKES WERE MADE AND SOMEBODY HAD TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE MISTAKES SOMEBODY HAD TO BE TO BLAME FOR THE FIRST JUDGEMENT ON CHILCOTT RESTS ON JUST SIX WORDS FOR MANY PEOPLE SIX WORDS OUT OF TWO AND A HALF MILLION THEY ARE
I WILL BE WITH YOU WHATEVER THEY WERE WRITTEN IN A MEMO SENT BY TONY BLAIR TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MY BLAIR IS WITH ME NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THAT MEMO WAS WRITTEN ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF JULY TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WE WENT TO WAR IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WHAT YOU WERE DOING
IN THAT JULY MEMO WAS COMMITTING THIS COUNTRY TO A COURSE OF ACTION FROM WHICH THERE COULD BE NO RETURN
NO THEY COULD WELL HAVE BEEN A POINT OF RETURN BECAUSE ACTUALLY AFTER THAT
MEMORANDUM OF COURSE THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF IT WAS TO ENSURE THAT THE AMERICANS WENT DOWN THE UNITED NATIONS ROUTE TO DEALING WITH THIS WHICH WE THEN BID HANDS WE HAD A RESOLUTION THEN A NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WHICH HAD THE TERMS OF THAT RESOLUTION BEEN SATISFIED THEN THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A WAR
SO IT'S TRUE IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE I TOOK HER A DECISION AND I
STAND BY THAT DECISION THAT WE SHOULD BE RIGHT ALONGSIDE AMERICA IN DEALING WITH THESE PROBLEMS POST NINE ELEVEN AND THAT INCLUDED THE ISSUE OF IRAQ BUT IT ISN'T CORRECT TO SAY THAT WE HAD MADE SOME IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT TO TWO WAR INDEED ACTUALLY THAT TRIBUNAL REPORT
IN ITS FINDINGS MAKES IT CLEAR THAT AT THAT POINT NO DECISIONS TO GO TO WAR HAD BEEN TAKEN NO WHAT IS A JOHN CHILCOT SAYS HE'S MY BLAIR'S NOTE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN DISCUSSED OR AGREED WITH HIS COLLEAGUES SET THE U.K. ON A PATH THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE U.K. SUBSEQUENTLY TO WITHDRAW ITS SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED STATES AND WE KNOW THAT WHAT THE UNITED STATES WANTED
WAS TO OVERTHROW SADDAM HUSSEIN YES BUT THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT IT IS WRITTEN IN JULY AND THEN WE WENT IN NOVEMBER THE UNITED NATIONS SO AND
IF WE HAD SUCCEEDED IN THE UNITED NATIONS BECAUSE THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE AMERICAN MINISTRATIONS WANT TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION IMMEDIATELY
IN THE END PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE CLOSENESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP WE PERSUADED THE AMERICANS TO GO BACK TO UNITED NATIONS AND GET THAT RESOLUTION THERE SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY WILL WE WERE
IRREVOCABLY COMMITTED IN JULY WE WENT OF COURSE BECAUSE WE THEN WENT TO UNITED NATIONS IN NOVEMBER HOWEVER WHAT IS TRUE AND I COMPLETELY EXCEPT THE LIMITED
IS THAT WE WERE GIVING THE UNITED STATES A VERY CLEAR COMMITMENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ALONGSIDE THEM IN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE HOW WE DEALT WITH THAT IS ANOTHER MATTER IN NO IT ISN'T DOESN'T IT BECAUSE OF YOUR USE OF THE WORD WHATEVER WHATEVER I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT THE NEXT WORD I USE USERS BUT ONE I HAVE THE THE MEMO IN FRONT OF ME SO BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT YES IT'S TRUE OF COURSE LOOK I BELIEVED IF WE WERE GOING TO
DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE SATISFACTORILY WE HAD TO BE RIGHT ALONG SIDE THE U.S. WE WERE THEIR FOREMOST ALLY PUT POST NINE ELEVEN I STILL BELIEVE THAT WAS THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF WHAT I WAS SAYING TO THE PRESIDENT WAS LOOK
THERE'S NO POLITICAL ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO GET IN THE WAY OF MY SUPPORT BUT HOW WE DEAL WITH IT IS THE ISSUE AND WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE U.N. AND THAT IS EVENTUALLY WHAT WAS AGREED EXCEPT THAT YOU
ACCEPTED IN THAT MEMO THAT HE HAD TO BE REMOVED BECAUSE AS YOU SAY YOUR SECOND SENTENCE STARTING BUT THIS IS THE MOMENT TO ASSESS BLUNTLY THE DIFFICULTIES AND SO ON IN THE THIRD PARAGRAPH
SAY THIS THE FIRST QUESTION IS IN REMOVING HIM DO YOU WANT OR NEED A COALITION SO YOU HAVE ACCEPTED IN JULY
OF THAT ERA OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THAT HE WAS TO BE REMOVED IT IS EXPLICIT HERE AND SHE'LL COTTEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NOW ACTUALLY I THINK YOU'LL FIND WHEN YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE REPORT THAT WE WE CAN GO OVER THIS WHAT I'M LOOKING AT THE MEMO IF DIGGER NO AS I SAY I HAVE HAD HIM AND I DON'T SEE HOW ELSE ONE CAN READ THAT RIGHT BUT BECAUSE
IT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF TRYING TO PERSUADE THE AMERICANS TO GO BACK TO THE UNITED NATIONS SO IF THEY GO BACK TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND THEY GET A RESOLUTION THERE THAT OF COURSE
AT THAT POINT THE SPOONS MILITARY ACTION WHICH WAS MY PURPOSE AND GIVES US A CHANCE TO RESOLVE THIS PEACEFULLY INDEED YOU'RE FIND ELSEWHERE IN THE REPORTING IN THE EVIDENCE THAT AFTER NOVEMBER
THE NOVEMBER RESOLUTION WAS PASSED THERE WAS A CONVERSATION WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH EXCEPTED EXPLICITLY THAT IF THERE WAS COMPLIANCE WITH FOURTEEN FORTY ONE THERE WOULDN'T BE MILITARY ACTION SO I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING OF COURSE YOU CAN TAKE THESE THESE FRASERS AND DEBATE WHAT THEY MEAN BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU WHAT I MEANT WAS VERY VERY CLEAN WAS CLEAR TO THE AMERICANS
I'M RIGHT ALONGSIDE YOU IN DEALING WITH THIS BUT LET'S DO IT THE RIGHT WAY AND IT HAS TO BE DONE THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS BUT THERE WAS NOT THAT CAVEAT WAS NOT ENTERED THERE WAS IT I WILL BE IF IT WAS YOUR VERY FIRST PHRASE YOUR BELIEF FIRST SIX WORDS IN THIS FAIRLY LONG MEMO I WILL BE WITH YOU WHATEVER
THAT'S TOTAL COMMITMENT TO DO WHATEVER THE UNITED STATES WANTED TO DO WHICH WAS TO REMOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN IN OTHER WORDS GO TO WAR AND WE WOULD GO WITH HIM THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT BECAUSE THE VERY THING WE WERE ARGUING FOR AN JULY WHY DID HE WAS TO GO BEVERLEY IN THAT BECAUSE WHAT I WAS SAYING TO HIM IS IN DEALING WITH THIS
I'M I'M YOUR ALLY I'M GONNA BE ALONGSIDE YOU BUT THE REASON WHY THE NEXT WORD IS BAD HE'S SO THAT YOU CAN THEN GO ON TO SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY TOUGH I HAVE TO SHOW ANOTHER NOBLE JUST BITS THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SO THEN LATER YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE SAT DOWN AND HAD TO BE GOT RID OF THE FIRST QUESTION IS IN REMOVING HIM NOT AT ALL
SO YOU ACCEPTED THAT HE HAD TO BE REMOVED BECAUSE WE THEN WENT BACK TO UNITED NATIONS SO IF YOU HAD TO IF YOU CAME TO A POINT
WHERE THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE WE WERE GOING TO BE WITH AMERICA BUT THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF GOING BACK TO THE UNITED NATIONS WAS TO SAY LET'S DEAL WITH THIS DIFFERENTLY THIS WAS BACK IN IN
JULY TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WE WON'T EVEN A YEAR ON FROM NINE ELEVEN AT THAT POINT I WAS VERY CLEAR AND AFTER NINE ELEVEN
THERE WERE THOSE WITHIN THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS THEY'D THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED IN THE WEST TERRORIST ATTACK THE WORLD HAD EVER KNOWN THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITHIN THAT ADMINISTRATION IT WAS SAYING THAT WE'RE JUST DEAL WITH THIS OUR OWN AS AMERICA
AND I WAS TRYING TO SAY NO WE WE'VE GOT A BUILD AN INTERNATIONAL COALITION SO FESTIVAL IN RESPECT OF AFGHANISTAN WE DID BUILD SUCH WILL NOT QUITE YOU SAID DO YOU WANT OR INDEED A COALITION YOU WEREN'T ADAMANT ABOUT IT RAISES THE POSSIBILITY BUT YOU WEREN'T SAYING THERE HAS TO BE A COALITION HERE OTHERWISE WE WON'T BE WITH YOU NO I WAS ASKING THEM WHETHER THEY WANT TO SIZE WE'D WON BUT I WAS VERY CLEAR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE WON AND WHAT WE THEN ASSEMBLED
FIRST AS I SAY IN GETTING RID OF THE TALIBAN AFGHANISTAN WE WERE SUCCESSFUL I WAS THEN TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING IN RELATION TO IRAQ BY GOING BACK TO THE U.N. AND SO
I WILL SEND YOU CAN YOU CAN TAKE THESE PHRASES OUT BUT THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO REALISE WHAT IT WAS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE I WAS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT AT THIS POINT WHEN WE WERE
LESS THAN A YEAR FROM NINE ELEVEN WHEN THE WHOLE OF THE WORLD SECURITY BEEN TURNED ON ITS HEAD I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT AMERICA DID NOT FEEL ALONE THAT IT DID NOT FEEL COMPELLED TO GO IT ALONE I WANTED TO BUILD AS BIGGER COALITION AS POSSIBLE
FRANKLY I DIDN'T WANT THE U.K. TO BE THEIR PARTNER OF CHOICE TO BE THERE
THE FIRST TELEPHONE CALL THEY MADE ON THESE ISSUES AND THE FIRST COUNTRY TO JOIN THEM ON THE BATTLEFIELD IF NECESSARY THE ONLY COUNTRY AND THIS IS ANOTHER POINT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE FOR CHILCOTT MAKES OF THE MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ MIGHT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY MIGHT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY AT SOME POINT BUT IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WHICH IS WHERE WE WENT TO WAR OF COURSE THERE WAS NO IMMINENT THREAT FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN
RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT LET ME PICK UP THE POINT WAS IT TRUE IN RESPONSE YOU ACCEPT THAT IT'S TRUE WELL IT'S NOT TRUE IN THIS SENSE THAT BY THE TIME WE HAD GOT TO THAT POINT OF IT IN PASSIN THE U.N. IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND THREE AND BY THE WAY THE WERE OVER
FORTY COUNTRIES IN THIS COALITION THERE WAS OVER HALF THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS IN THE COALITION JAPAN WAS IN AUSTRALIA WAS IN IT YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE THAT THE BRITISH WEATHER KEY ALLIES OF AMERICAN IT'S TRUE THAT I HAD VERY MUCH SOUGHT TO MAKE HER SO BUT WHEN SIR JOHN CHILCOT SAYS WELL IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY LATER TO HAVE REMOVED SADDAM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT LATER MEANS AN AQUA LATER MEANS IN PART OF HAVING FIRM EVIDENCE THAT THEY DID INDEED HAVE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A THREAT TO US AND WHAT HE SAYS IS THE STRATEGY OF CONTAINMENT COULD HAVE BEEN ADAPTED AND CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME THE MAJORITY OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL SUPPORTED
CONTINUING U.N. INSPECTIONS ARE MONITORING I'M HERSELF SPOKE I DID A VERY LONG HALF HOUR INTERVIEW WITH HAMMERS BRICKS ONE OF THE CHIEF INSPECTOR'S WEAPONS INSPECTORS AND HE SAID HAD THAT THEY HAD MORE TIME THEY WOULD HAVE CARRIED ON DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT WHEN THEY WERE CALLED OFF THEY HAD NO EVIDENCE OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THAT'S WHAT I TRIED TO DO
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS IT WHAT I TRIED TO DO IN MARCH WHEN THERE WAS THIS IMPASSIVE HE WHEN HE'S I SAT DOWN WITH HANS BLIX AND WE CONSTRUCTED THE SET OF SIX TESTS BECAUSE SADDAM WAS NOT COMPLYING FOR EXAMPLE HE WASN'T ALLOWING INTERVIEWS TO BE CONDUCTED WITH THAT HIS KEY PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY THEY CAN ONLY BE CONDUCTED IN COUNTRY WHERE THEY CAN BE INTIMIDATED SO WE CONSTRUCTED A SET OF SIX TESTS THAT HE HAD TO COMPLY WITH
BUT THE AMERICANS FOR REASONS I UNDERSTAND WOULD ONLY ACCEPT THAT IT WAS BACK WITH AN ULTIMATUM AND BASICALLY THERE WAS A PROFOUND DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN PRESIDENT PUTIN AND PRESIDENT CHIRAC ON THE ONE SIDE AND PRESIDENT BUSH ON THE OTHER AND THEN AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE NOW
THE QUESTION THEN IS IN THE LONGER TERM
OH KATE IF PEOPLE SAY WILL YOU SHOULD DESIST JUST BACKED AWAY THEN I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT LET'S SUPPOSE WE HAD A LET'S SUPPOSE WE HAVEN'T TAKEN ACTION THIS IS WHERE I THINK THE FINDINGS OF THE IRAQ SURVEY GROUP ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT I MEAN THIS WAS THE AUTHORITATIVE REPORT DONE BY
LEADING THE U.N. WEAPONS INSPECTOR WITH FOURTEEN HUNDRED EXPERTS AND I THINK I WAS RIGHT AND WELL AND HE WAS A DEEPLY DEEPLY UPSET ANGRY ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE WAS CALLED OFF THE JOB THAT HE WAS DOING HE THOUGHT ADEQUATELY NO
IT'S CORRECT THAT HANS BLIX OPPOSES THIS BUT THE PERSON WHO LED THE FINAL IRAQ SURVEY GROUP BOUGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FOR AN CONDUCTED THE INTERVIEWS WITH SADDAM AND WITH HIS LEADING OFFICIALS
THE CONCLUSION OF THAT REPORT AND TO BE FAIR THE THE INQUIRY ACTUALLY ENDORSES THIS AND SAYS THESE FINDINGS ARE SIGNIFICANT WHAT HE SAYS IS YES THE REASON WHY THE INTELLIGENCE TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG WAS THAT SADDAM WAS KEEN TO GET RID OF SANCTIONS
AND THEREFORE WANTED TO GET RID OF THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF HIS PROGRAMME WELL HE RETAINED THE CAPACITY AND THE INTENT TO RECONSTITUTE THAT PROGRAMME
A NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME AND BE A CHEMICAL WEAPON LET ME REMIND YOU WHAT CHILCOTT SAID IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT POLICY ON IRAQ WAS MADE ON THE BASIS YOU WILL KNOW THIS QUOTE VERY WELL OF FLAWED INTELLIGENT AND ASSESSMENTS THEY WORKED NOT CHALLENGED AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HE WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT A LOT OF HIS LANGUAGE IS FAIRLY COMPLICATED THIS COULD NOT BE CLEAR WHETHER THEY WEREN'T CHALLENGED ON THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN WHY DIDN'T YOU CHALLENGE THEM
WELL I'M I RELIED ON THE ASSESSMENTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO ME BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY CERTAINLY GIVEN OUR EXPERIENCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER YES D'YOU HAVE TO HAVE CHALLENGED THEM MORE MORE CLEARLY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK THE INQUIRY ALSO EXCEPT THAT
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE WERE PRESENTED WITH THEM BY THE WAY AYE AYE SIR ALWAYS SAY THIS TO PEOPLE IF YOU WANT TO GO AND SEE THE ACTUAL INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT I RECEIVED YOU CAN GO AND READ THEM ONLINE AIDS YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT I WAS BEING TOLD YES BUT YOU DIDN'T CHANGE HIT THAT IS THE WHOLE WELL I COS YOU WANTED TO BELIEVE IT BUT IT WASN'T THAT I WANTED TO BELIEVE IT I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT OF COURSE IS THAT IS THAT GOING TO DO A COURSE OF ACTION NO IT WAS BECAUSE HAVING THE SAME THEY'RE ACTUALLY USE THESE WEAPONS AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE
IN THE IRANIAN WAR FOR EXAMPLE A MILLION CASUALTIES OF THAT WAR THE ONE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY HIS CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROGRAMME HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAMME THEY'VE BEEN STOPPED BY THE ISRAELIS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT YOU KNOW THE FIRST MILITARY ACTION EITHER TOOK AS PRIME MINISTER WAS ACTUALLY WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT
WHEN WE TOOK AIR STRIKES AGAINST BAGHDAD ON THE BASIS OF THE EXPULSION OF THE THEN WEAPONS INSPECTORS AND BY THE WAY FROM THAT MOMENT ON IT BECAME THE POLICY OF THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION
FIRST UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON THEN UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH FOR REGIME CHANGE AND IT WAS YOUR BELIEF ON ONE QUESTION HE CAME CLEAR TWO TO THAT OF THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT THAT YOU WOULD NOT GO TO WAR IN A RACK FOR REASONS OF REGIME CHANGE THAT WAS YOUR ORIGINAL POSITION AS IT WAS AS YOU WILL REMEMBER BUT ON THE QUESTION OF OF INTELLIGENCE YOU DENIED THE CABINET ACCESS TO THE FULL PAPERS THAT YOU WERE GETTING ON AND AGAIN I'M QUOTING CHILCOTT HERE
IF YOU DID NOT HAVE THE CABINET MEETINGS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE DISCUSSION SHE SHOULD HAVE HAD ALL OF THOSE INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING SOME OF WHICH YOU HAVE IT WOULD IT WITH JUST ONE OTHER PERSON WERE DENIED TO MANY MEMBERS OF THE CABINET THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY WEREN'T IN A POSITION TO CHALLENGING NO THAT'S THAT'S NOT CORRECT THAT'S WHAT CHILCOTT SAY NO I DON'T THINK HE SAYS THAT WHAT HE SAYS IS THIS WHICH SHOULD I ACCEPT THIS BY THE WAY MOST SCAR JUST GIVES OTHER PEOPLE KNOW WHAT HE SAID MOST DECISIONS ON A RIGHT PRE COMPLET WERE TAKEN EITHER BILATERALLY
BETWEEN MISTER BLAIR AND THE RELEVANT SECRETARY OF STATE OR IN MEETINGS BETWEEN MY BLAME MY STRAW MISTER HOON WITH NUMBER TEN OFFICIALS AND SOMETIMES JOHN SCARLETT SOME OF THOSE MEETINGS WERE MINUTED SOME WERE NOT YES BUT YOU WERE SUGGESTING THAT I KEPT BACK FROM PEOPLE THE INTELLIGENCE
ALL MEMBERS ALL MEMBERS OF THE CABINET INDEED MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION WERE ALLOWED FULL ACCESS TO AND THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND FULL ACCESS TO THE BRIEFINGS THERE WASN'T LOOK THERE WASN'T REALLY A DOWELLED IN MOST PEOPLE'S MINDS AND MOST INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT SADDAM HAD THIS CAPABILITY AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS PERFECTLY SIMPLE THAT HE'D HAD IT BEFORE HE'D USED IT SO BUT BUT YOU WASN'T A DON'T HOW DO YOU KNOW THERE WASN'T OUT THE WEAPONS INSPECTORS WEREN'T ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THE DRAWER
THE REASONS WHY FINALLY WHEN YOU CAME TO TO THE EIGHTEENTH MARCH THERE WAS AN IMPASSE IN THE U.N. HE HADN'T COMPLIED FULLY HE'D BEGUN TO COMPLY BUT THEN WE HAD BY THAT TIME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS DOWN IN THEATRE AS I SAY THERE WAS THEN AN IMPACT AND I HAD TO DECIDE WILL BE WITH AMERICA OR NOT WITH AMERICA DID WE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES BELIEVE IT WAS RIGHT TO REMOVE SADDAM OR NOT AND I
I I'VE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE WITH MY DECISION I TOOK IT IN GOOD FAITH COS I GENUINELY THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO WELL IN THAT CASE WHY WASN'T A LORD GOLDSMITH WHO WAS THE ATTORNEY JOHN THE TIME OF COURSE THE SENIOR LEGAL
OFFICER SHOULD HAVE NOT ASKED TO PROVIDE WRITTEN ADVICE WHICH FULLY REFLECTED THE POSITION ON THE SEVENTEENTH OF MARCH EXPLAINING AT THE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH THIS COUNTRY COULD TAKE MILITARY ACTION AND SET OUT THE RISKS OF LEGAL CHALLENGE THE ADVICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO MINISTERS AND SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO'S RESPONSIBLE THESE WERE DIRECTLY ENGAGED AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO CABINET THAT IS WHAT CHILCOTT
YES AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS HE DIDN'T PROVIDE THE WRITTEN ADVICE BECAUSE HE ATTENDED THE CABINET AND WAS THERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHAT ARE YOU LIKE BUT I LIKE TO SAY WHAT I MEAN LOOK AT IT IF HE'D
AGAIN A LOAD IT WASN'T IN FACT THE PRESIDENT I THINK FROM NOW ON THE LEGAL ADVICE PROBABLY IS PROVIDED IN WRITING TO CABINET BUT ALL I'M SAYING IS IT'S NOT THAT HIS ADVICE WAS CONCEALED AND SOME WAY HE CAME TO CABINET HE EXPLAINED HIS ADVICE WE EXPLAINED IT ORALLY ROUND THE CABINET TABLE AND CABINET MEMBERS WERE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT BUT FRANKLY IN THE END
WHAT MOST OF PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW IS WHAT HIS CONCLUSION WAS SO YOU KNOW I DON'T
I DON'T DISMISS THESE ISSUES OF PROCESS ALL THESE CRITICISMS THAT ARE MADE AT ALL THERE'S ONLY SO ENTERED FITTINGLY CLEAR ON THAT THEN THEN WHEN WE'VE CONCLUDED THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH IT WAS DECIDED THERE WAS A LEGAL BASIS FOR U.K. MILITIA WERE FAR FROM SATISFACTORY YOU ACCEPT THAT I ACCEPT THE PROCESS WAS FAR FROM SATISFACTORY SIR BUT NOT YOUR PART IN IT
OF COURSE MY PARTNER AS WELL I ACCEPT THE PROCESS WAS I DON'T ACCEPT THAT NO WHAT SHOULD YOU HAVE DONE ALL THE THINGS THAT HE SAYS WHICH IS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF HE'D PROVIDED THE ACTUAL WRITTEN ADVICE TO CABINET I PERSONALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT DIFFERENCE THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SINCE AS I SAY HE WAS THERE AND ROUND THE TABLE AND YOU COULD HAVE THEN HAD A PROPER CABINET DECISION ABOUT THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SPECIFIC ADVICE THAT HE WAS OFFERING AND THE REASONS FOR IT BUT THERE'LL BE WE HAD THAT ANYWAY HE WAS THERE AT THAT THEY'VE GOT
WELL YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T SAID WE DIDN'T HAVE THE DISCUSSION THAT LOOK I'M STANCES IN WHICH IT WAS DECIDED WERE FAR FROM SATISFACTORY BUT YOU ASKED ME SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE CABINET DISCUSSION
I ACCEPT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IN RETROSPECT AND IT WOULD HAVE BUT THEY MADE ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL IF YOU PROVIDED THE WRITTEN ADVICE AS OPPOSED HIM COMING AND ORALLY TAKING PEOPLE THROUGH THE ADVICE AND GIVING PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO QUESTION HIM NOW ACTUALLY AS A MATTER OF FACT PEOPLE DIDN'T QUESTION HIM BUT IF YOU CAN PUT ALL THESE
THESE POINTS IN THEM THERE I DON'T DISMISS THEM AT ALL I TAKE THEM VERY SERIOUSLY I TAKE ALL THE POINTS OF PROCESS VERY SERIOUSLY I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AS I SAID YESTERDAY FOR THEIR MISTAKES BUT I JUST ASKED PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON TWO THINGS ONE IS IS THE WORLD BETTER OFF
WITHOUT SADDAM IN POWER BECAUSE IN THE END THAT IS IN MY VIEW ONE AT LEAST CRITICAL QUESTION OUT OF THIS AND I WOULD ARGUE VERY STRONGLY THAT WHATEVER THE DIFFICULTIES OF PROCESS AND PLANNING IT WAS STILL THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THE SECOND IS WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IF YOU GO INTO
A CONFLICT LIKE THIS YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE JUNIOR PARTNER AMERICAN NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE ASSETS IN THIS
IS THIS SOMETHING WE WANT TO ENGAGE IN IN THE FUTURE AND ONE EYE THINGS ONE OF THE ONLY THING I FEEL THAT IS WHERE THE REPORTERS I THINK QUITE WE CAUSE WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL LESSONS WE REALLY WANT TO LEARN
ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF COMMITMENT ARE WE PREPARED TO MAKE AS A COUNTRY IN THE FUTURE RIGHT WHAT A LIE SO YOU'RE STILL SAYING AS I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE STILL SAYING IT WAS RIGHT TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ
IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND THREE BECAUSE SADDAM WAS DEPOSED RULER STILL SAYING THAT IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS THE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND I USE THE WORD NOT LIKELY AT ALL I USE THE WORD ENTIRELY SERIOUSLY THE CUTTER STRUCK AT THE STOP EVENTS THAT FOLLOWED SO I WOULD SAY TO YOU
IN ORDER TO TEST THAT PROPERLY COS I AGREE AND THE EVENTS IN IRAQ DID NOT TURN OUT AS WE WANTED IN THE COUNTRY WENT INTO CIVIL WAR WHICH WAS ONLY REALLY CURED BY THE SURGE AND THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DID YES THAT IS TRUE THAT IT CONCERT THAT IS WHAT THAT IS TRUE BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT AFTER THE SURGE IN TWENTY TEN IRAQ WAS ESSENTIALLY
A RELATIVELY PLY WHICH TIME HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN MURDERED BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE MURDERED BEFORE SADDAM WAS DEPOSED SO YOUR SON WAS QUICKLY BUT YOU'RE STILL SAYING
THAT EVENTS AT THE EVENTS THAT FLOWED FROM THAT WAR WOULD JUSTIFIED BECAUSE WE GOT RID OF AN ADMITTEDLY BRUTAL VERY NASTY DICTATOR WHO BRACKETS WAS NOT THREATENING THIS NATION AT ALL WELL I DO SAY THAT BUT LET ME JUST GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO EXPLAIN WHY IT'S NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE VICTIMS OF SADDAM BEFORE HE WAS DEPOSED IT'S ALSO FOR TWO OTHER REASONS
WHAT WE NOW KNOW AS I SAY FROM THE IRAQ SURVEY GROUP WHICH IS ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY ENDORSED BY THE INQUIRY REPORT IS THAT IF HE'D BEEN LEFT IN POWER HE WOULD HAVE GONE BACK TO HIS PROGRAMMES AGAIN AND I'VE GOT SOME SHAME WE CAN'T BE SURE OF THAT OF COURSE WE CAN'T BE SURE IN INSOMUCH THAT INTELLIGENCE WAS DEEPLY DEEPLY FLAWED HOW WOULD WE KNOW WHAT THIS INTELLIGENCE IS LET'S SAY
BASED ON AN ACTUAL CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM AND WITH HIS CHELA TENANTS I AGREE YOU CAN'T SAY FOR SURE BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER SAY WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN A PARTICULAR COURSE OF ACTION BUT I THINK IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE TO SAY THAT IF THIS REPORT IS RIGHT HE WOULD HAVE POSED A THREAT SPECIFICALLY ON THE ISSUE OF NUCLEAR AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUT MORE IMPORTANT WHEN THE ARAB SPRING BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND WIN ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES HAD THEIR GOVERNMENT'S EITHER TOPPLED OR PUT UNDER PRESSURE
I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO KEEP POWER IN THE SAME WAY AS A SAD IN SYRIA AND THE NIGHTMARE THAT IS SYRIA TODAY WHERE BY THE WAY DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES WE NOW HAVE THE WORST REFUGEE CRISIS THE WORLD HAS SEEN SINCE WORLD WAR TWO
AT LEAST IN IRAQ TODAY YOU'VE GOT IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS ACCEPTED AS LEGITIMATE THE PRODUCT OF AN ELECTION AND ACTING WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT YOU YOU SEEM TO BE ALMOST WRITING OFF THE HELLISH CONDITIONS THAT PREVAILED IN IRAQ WITHIN DAYS WILL BEAKS PERHAPS OF THE END OF THE WAR THE FACT THE MASSES OF PEOPLE WERE KILLING EACH OTHER AND THAT WAS BECAUSE YOU
AND THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES CERTAINLY MADE NO PROVISION AT ALL FOR WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER SADDAM HAD BEEN OVERTHROWN I THINK THE FESTIVAL IT WAS ANARCHY FIRST OF ALL
I DON'T WRITE IT OFF AT ALL I MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOT AND ONE OF THE REASONS I STOOD UP YESTERDAY AND SAID I ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY WITHOUT EXCEPTION WITHOUT EXCUSES PRECISELY
BUT I DO SAY THAT THIS IS THE DIFFICULTY BECAUSE IN THE END I HAD A
IN A SENSE TO VERY BINARY DECISIONS TO DECISIONS THERE DIDN'T DIDN'T HAVE ANY THERE WAS NO OTHER DECISION
ONE WAS WHETHER WE JOINED THE COALITION WITH THE AMERICANS AND THE OTHER WAS JOINING TO GET RID OF SAD A SANE AND ALL I'M SAYING IS WHEN YOU JUDGE THE WISDOM OF THOSE DECISIONS AND WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON THEM
IT IS IMPORTANT TO ASK OURSELVES THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE TAKEN THE OPPOSITE DECISION THAT I TELL YOU WHAT CHILCOTT SAYS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU DID WHAT YOU DID HE SAID THE RISKS OF INTERNAL STRIFE IN IRAQ ACTIVE IRANIAN PURSUIT OF ITS INTEREST REGIONAL INSTABILITY AND AL KINDA ACTIVE IN IRAQ WERE EACH EXPLICITLY IDENTIFIED BEFORE BEFORE THE INVASION SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU KNEW
WHAT THE DANGERS WERE BEFORE YOU SENT US TO WAR
IF YOU LOOK BACK THIS IS ONE PART OF THE OR THE SUMMARY OF HIS REPORT WHERE I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE OF THE EVIDENCE
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY CLEAR WITH THE PRINCIPAL THINGS WE WERE ADVISED ON WERE HUMANITARIAN DISASTERS THE POTENTIAL OF WELL NO THEY WERE LARGELY AVOIDED ACTUALLY HUMANITARIAN MAN IT IS ALL RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS THE SECTARIAN CONFLICT
FROM H.Q. ON THE ONE SIDE IRAN ON THE OTHER WE NOW KNOW SYRIA WAS ALSO SENDING PEOPLE ACROSS THE BORDER THE WARNINGS ON THAT WERE VERY VERY LIMITED MOST OF THE INTELLIGENCE INDICATED THAT THE IRANIANS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN SO OPPOSED TO SADDAM
WOULD NOT CAUSE TROUBLE INDEED THERE WAS DISPUTES IN THE INTELLIGENCE EVEN IN LATE TWO THOUSAND THREE EARLY TWO THOUSAND FOR ABOUT THAT AND YET THE IRANIANS ACTUALLY PLAYED A VERY
DESTABILISING PART IN IRAQ BUT I'M BACKING THIS YEAR BUT THE POINT IS THAT CHILCOTT SAID WHITEHALL DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR MINISTERS YOUR MINISTERS FAILED TO PUT COLLECTIVE WEIGHT BEHIND THE TASK THAT HAD TO BE DONE YOU TONY BLAIR DID NOT ESTABLISHED CLEAR MINISTERIAL OVERSIGHT OF U.K. PLANNING AND PREPARATION AND SHE DID NOT ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A FLEXIBLE REALISTIC AND FULLY RESOURCED PLANNED THAT INTEGRATED U.K. MILITARY AND CIVILIAN CONTRIBUTIONS AND ADDRESSED THE KNOWN RISKS THAT'S THE POINT
YOU WERE WARM TO VERY VERY CLEARLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THIS INVASION UNLESS CERTAIN THINGS WERE DONE AND YOU DIDN'T DO THEM IT'S ADULT IS WHAT WE SEE TODAY I ACCEPT THAT I ACCEPT MANY OF THE CRITICISMS ON PLANNING A LOW I WOULD POINT OUT THAT EVEN IF WE DIDN'T HAVE
SPECIFIC FORMAL COMMITTEES WE DID HAVE AD HOC COMMITTEES THAT WORKED REASONABLY SATISFACTORY BUT IT IT REALLY ISN'T RIGHT THAT WHAT WE WERE WARNED WOULD BE THE PRINCIPAL DANGEROUS WE FACED WERE ALQAEDA IRAN AND AS I SAY THIS ISSUE TO DO WITH SYRIA WELL CHILCOTT SPENT SEVEN YEARS LOOKING INTO THIS AND I DID BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE OF THE REPORT YOU'LL FIND IT'S A LOT MORE
NUANCED IN THAT PARROT WILL LET ME GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC AND THAT IS OUR OWN BOYS WHO WERE LENT THEM THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE FIGHTING THEIR MANY OF HER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE OF WHOM LOST THEIR LIVES OR WHY DIDN'T YOU LIKE THE M.O.D. TO PREPARE EARLIER OR INSIST THAT THEY ACTED FASTER ON EQUIPMENT AND FORCE PROTECTION IT WAS SHOCKING WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE YOUNG MEN WASN'T IT
I DON'T RECALL A SINGLE OCCASION IN WHICH WE WERE ASKED FOR
MORE RESOURCES MORE EQUIPMENT THAT WE DIDN'T SAY YES WE HAD AN ENDLESS SUCCESSION OF SENIOR MILITARY FIGURE SEEN SNATCH RUN LAND ROVERS ARE COFFINS
I I MEAN I'M NOT IN CHARGE AND CAN'T BE IN CHARGE OBVIOUSLY OF THE ACTUAL EQUIPMENT THE DISNEY SEVENTY ORDERS YES BUT JUST SAYING TO YOU IN THERE I THINK THIS AGAIN TO BE FAIR IF YOU READ THE BODY OF THE PORT THEY MAKE THIS CLEAR
RIGHT AT THE OUTSET WHAT I SAID AND AND GORDON BROWN SAID THE SAME IS THERE IS NO RESOURCE LIMITATION IF YOU TELL US WHAT YOU NEED YOU WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T I CAN'T SAY WHAT IS THE RIGHT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT TO USE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND ONE THING I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE ARMED FORCES IS THAT
THE FIRST PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN WAS ACTUALLY BRILLIANT MILITARY SUCCESS I MEAN WITHIN TWO MONTHS SADDAM WAS DEPOSED THE PROBLEMS WE GOT INTO OTHER PROBLEMS OF SECTARIAN TERRORISM WHICH WE SEE EVERYWHERE IN THE REGION TODAY
AND YOU CAN YOU CAN DO A LOT OF PLANNING FOR THOSE WHO SEE IF I WAS IN THE END O.K. DO THE FIGHT ON AND IT WASN'T YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IT WARM OF COURSE EVERYTHING IS MY RESPONSIBILITY NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY ALL I'M SAYING TO YOU IS THAT IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT SOUGHT BY OUR TROOPS OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO GET A REQUEST FROM THAT FOR THAT AND ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT ANY TIME WE EVER RECEIVED A REQUEST OR PEOPLE SAID
YOU WE NEED THIS EQUIPMENT RESOURCE WAS NEVER AN ISSUE AS YOU KNOW ARE OUR ATTITUDE WAS DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO CHILL CAN'T SAYS IT WAS A SERIOUS MATTER WE FOUND THE M.O.D. SLOW IN RESPONDING TO THE THREAT FROM IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES DELAYS IN PROVIDING ADEQUATE MEDIUM WEIGHT PROTECTED BEAGLES AND SO ON IT WASN'T CLEAR WHICH PERSONAL DEPARTMENT WITH THE M.O.D. WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR AND SO ON AND SO ON IT'S A HUGE INDICTMENT OF THE LACK OF PREPAREDNESS AND WE KNOW
THE OUTCOME OF THAT WE HAD ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE E. MIO MEN OR WOMEN DEAD
THE THE PARADISE FURTHER
THE CONFLICT AND I THINK I HAVE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS EXCEPTED WHERE WE FELL SHORT ALL I WOULD SAY ON THE EQUIPMENT AND THE SPECIFIC
ITEMS OF EQUIPMENT THE PEOPLE SORT IS THAT AT ANY POINT IN TIME WHEN PEOPLE NEEDED THAT FROM FROM THE POLITICAL SIDE AT LEAST THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING OTHER THAN FULL SUPPORT SO I DON'T
I CAN'T COMMENT ON DETAIL ON WHAT REQUESTS WERE MADE
THROUGH THE M.O.D. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE REQUESTS BUT FROM THE POLITICAL SIDE WE WERE ALWAYS VERY CLEAR THAT WE SHOULD GIVE EVERY SUPPORT WE POSSIBLY COULD YOU SAID YESTERDAY YOU FEEL MORE SORROW REGRET AND APOLOGY THEN THE PUBLIC AND I'M QUOTING MAY EVER KNOW OR BELIEVE
REGRET FOR WHAT PRECISELY REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF LIFE YES IT WOULD RENT FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS
INSOFAR AS THERE WERE MISTAKES MADE INSOFAR AS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS WAS WRONG AND I RELIED ON IT YES OF COURSE THAT THE INTELLIGENCE WAS WRONG AND YOU RELIED ON IT DO YOU REGRET THAT YOU DIDN'T INTERROGATE THAT INTELLIGIBLE TO RATHER MORE THOROUGHLY WELL OF COURSE I REGRET IN RETROSPECT THAT WE DIDN'T CHALLENGE SHOULD I DON'T YOU COS IT DOES SOUND A LITTLE BIT AS THOUGH YOU'RE SAYING A LOT OF PEOPLE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES AND THAT'S HUGELY REGRETTABLE BUT BUT ACTUALLY I SLIGHTLY STAND ABOVE ALL THAT WELL I DON'T THINK YOU COULD SAY THAT I MEAN YESTERDAY
STOOD UP AND ACCEPT THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND I DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO BECAUSE YOU WERE PRIME MINISTER SO YOU CAN'T RESULT FROM THAT AND THAT IS THE REALITY THE QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM THE WAY YOU DID THAT'S THE QUESTION ISN'T IT AND I AGREE COMPLETELY THERE WHEN YOU GO BACK OVER IT FOR EXAMPLE ON THE INTELLIGENCE
YES IN RETROSPECT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE CHALLENGE THAT I UNDERSTAND THE MISTAKES OF PLANNING AND SO ON AND SO FORTH ARE LOTS OF THINGS I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN EXPRESS DEEP REGRETFUL WHICH I FEEL THAT EVERY DAY DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT I DO WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY DAY IT WAS THE BIGGEST DECISION I EVER TOOK IN GOVERNMENT AS MOST DIFFICULT DECISION I EVER TOOK
BUT I SOMETIMES THE PROBLEM IS THAT I FEEL UNTIL I ACTUALLY SAY TO PEOPLE O.K. I WISH WE HAD NOT JOINED THE AMERICAN COALITION WE SHOULD NOT GOT RID OF SADDAM UNTIL I SAY THAT PEOPLE WON'T REALLY EXCEPT THAT I MEAN MY REGRET AND I CAN REGRET
THE MISTAKES I CAN REGRET MANY THINGS ABOUT IT BUT I I GENUINELY BELIEVE NOT JUST THAT WE ACTED OUT OF GOOD MOTIVES THAN I DID WHEN I DIDN'T GOOD FAITH BUT THEN I I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT
WE WOULD BE IN A WORSE POSITION IF WE HADN'T ACTED IN THAT WAY NO I MAY BE COMPLETELY WRONG ABOUT THAT AND THESE THESE ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT JUDGE SOME SAY YOU'RE DELUDED
WELL SOMEONE CAN JUST SAY WHAT WHY DON'T THEY JUST SAY THEY DISAGREE BUT IF IF SOMEONE
ONCE THERE TO DISAGREE THEY SHOULD AT LEAST AND THAT'S WHY I SET OUT IN SUCH DETAIL YESTERDAY THE COUNTER FACTUAL WHAT IF WE HADN'T DONE AT WHAT HAVE WE LEFT
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CONSEQUENCES DURING THE ARAB SPRING LOOK AT SYRIA TODAY LOOK AT LIBYA TODAY I I UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE STILL DISAGREE BUT AT LEAST DO DO DO ME THE RESPECT RESPECTIVE I RESPECT YOUR POSITION DO ME THE RESPECT OF GOING AND READING MY ARGUMENT AND UNDERSTANDING THAT
THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT YOU MAY DECIDE IN THE END NO I DON'T AGREE WITH IT BUT IT'S YOU DON'T LIKE MY WORRY IS WHEN ALL OF THESE DEBATES
CONDUCTED AROUND AROUND CHARACTER IN GOOD FAITH AND HIS EYES AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL WHAT YOU END UP THE CASUALTY HAVE OF THE OTHER OF A DEBATE THAT'S ALL ABOUT
THAT TYPE OF INVECTIVE IS IS IT YOU THEN UNABLE TO
TO HAVE A PROPER DEBATE ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE COS WE SEE IT EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD TODAY ISN'T A SENSE PERHAPS
WHICH YOU YOU'RE A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN WE KNOW THAT
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU IN A SENSE TO OFFER THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE WAR THE APOLOGY THE FULL APOLOGY THEY FEEL IS NEEDED BECAUSE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SIMPLY COULDN'T BEAR AND I WONDER WHETHER HE WHETHER YOU PRAY AT ALL AND WHETHER YOU ASK GOD FOR
GOODNESS I THINK UM THERE MAY WELL BE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT UNTIL I SAY I SAY I TOOK THE WRONG DECISION BUT I'M NOT PROPERLY SORRY I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT
BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IT BECAUSE BECAUSE I I DON'T
THINK THAT THIS STRUGGLE WAS IN VAIN IN THE END WHEN I LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST TODAY AND IT FORGIVE ME SAYING THIS BUT AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THE TIME WATCHING IT AND LOOKING AT IT I SEE THE STRUGGLE THAT'S GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHICH IS ALL TO DO WITH COULDN'T THESE COUNTRIES GET TO RELIGIOUSLY TOLERANT PLURALISTIC SOCIETY IS GOING TO GET TO RULE BASED ECONOMIES AND DEMOCRACY AND LOOKING AT IT AND I'M THINKING
O.K. WHAT WE DID IN REMOVING SADDAM HAD TERRIBLE CONSTANCE CONSEQUENCES THAT WE DID NOT FORESEE AND I UNDERSTAND ALL THE CRITICISMS BUT WHEN I LOOK AT IT TODAY I THINK STILL THAT WE WE MOVED WITH THE GRAIN OF WHERE THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BE IN THESE COUNTRIES AND IN THIS REGION AND IN THE END WHEN I LOOK AT OTHER
BATTLEFIELDS OR BATTLE GROUNDS IN THE REGION ARE WE BETTER OFF IN SYRIA IT THEN WE ARE IN IRAQ I DON'T KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT THIS DEBATE CAN'T JUST BE CONDUCTED IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHETHER
MY DECISION IN IRAQ WAS TAKEN ON ON RIGHT OR WRONG GROUNDS OR IN GOOD FAITH OR BAD FAITH IT'S AT SOME POINT WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HER AND WHAT I WOULD CALL A RE DEEP DEBATE ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE
# TONY BLAIR MANY THANKS IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICE WAS AT LAST NIGHT'S BIG EURGH TWENTY SIXTEEN MANSION NOW WITH THE SPORTS NEWS MORNING MATTHEW
GOOD MORNING MICHELLE ENGLAND MAY HAVE HAD A NIGHTMARE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT THE WELSH DREAM WAS WONDERFUL ENCHANTING AND MAGICAL STORY WHILE IT LASTED PORTUGAL HOWEVER BEAT WALES TWO ZERO TO GO THROUGH TO THE FINAL CRISTIANO RONALDO OR NANI BOTH SCORED

# TONY BLAIR'S TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT IT WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER IF HE HAD CHALLENGED MORE VIGOROUSLY INTELLIGENCE CLAIMS THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION MY BLAIR SAID THAT HE GENUINELY BELIEVED THE CLAIMS BECAUSE THE FORMER IRAQI LEADER HAD USED THEM BEFORE AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE
MY BLAIR'S COMMENTS FOLLOW SIR JOHN CHILCOT INQUIRY INTO THE INVASION OF IRAQ WHICH YESTERDAY CONCLUDED MY BLAIR RELIED ON FLAWED INTELLIGENCE HAD OVERSTATED THE THREAT POSED BY SADDAM HUSSEIN CONSERVATIVE M.P.S WILL DECIDE TODAY WHICH TO LEADERSHIP CANDIDATES WILL GO FORWARD TO A VOTE OF PARTY MEMBERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE CANDIDATES ARE THERESA MAY MICHAEL GO AND ANDREA LET'S
THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WHEN JEREMY CORBIN SPOKE YESTERDAY IN THE WAKE OF THE CHILCOTT REPORT HE CALLED THE INVASION OF IRAQ ILLEGAL AN ACTIVE MILITARY AGGRESSION A CATASTROPHE AND HE APOLOGISED ON BEHALF OF THE LABOUR PARTY FOR WHAT HE CALLED THE DISASTROUS DECISION TO GO TO WAR HE DID NOT HOWEVER ATTACK TONY BLAIR PERSONALLY ALL THE CONSERVATIVES FOR OVERWHELMINGLY VOTING FOR THE WAR IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND THREE DIANE ABBOTT THE SHADOW HEALTH SECRETARY IS WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING
WHY DIDN'T JEREMY CORBIN I'D TALK ABOUT TONY BLAIR PERSONALLY OR REFER TO HIM IT'S NOT ABOUT ATTACKING TONY BLAIR PERSONALLY IT'S ABOUT ALL THE BRITISH SOLDIERS THAT DIED THE THOUSANDS OF IRAQIS THAT DIED AND THE CATASTROPHIC RESULTS FOR THE REGION AND THE POINT I WOULD WANT TO MAKE COS I THINK IT'S GOT A BIT MUDDLED IS THAT
WHEN WE VOTED ON THIS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND I WAS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN THAT PERIOD WE WEREN'T ASKED TO VOTE ON REGIME CHANGE WHICH IS HOW TONY BLAIR AND OTHERS ARE NOW JUSTIFYING WHAT THEY DID WE WERE ASKED TO VOTE ON THE PRESENCE OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
AND THE EVIDENCE FOR THE PRESENCE OF FLAT LAST WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WAS ALWAYS EQUIVOCAL IRON OTHERS SMACK WITH SCOTT RITTER WHO WAS THE LAST WEAPONS INSPECTOR IN IRAQ AND HE SAID WHEN HE LEFT IRAQ THERE WERE NO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION APART FOR A FEW CHEMICAL WEAPONS WHICH WAS DEGRADED BY NOW THE EVIDENCE WAS NEVER A STRONG HAVE YOU YOU HAVE WRITTEN A YOURSELF ABOUT TONY BLAIR'S OWN ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY YOU'VE WRITTEN IN THE GUARDIAN TO SAY THE CHILCOTT REPORT PROVIDES A DEVASTATING INDICTMENT OF TONY BLAIR
PREPARATIONS FOR AN CONDUCT OF THE WAR MANY PEOPLE HAD EXPECTED THE JEREMY CORBIN WOULD USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK DIRECTLY ABOUT TONY BLAIR AND INDEED TO USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE CONSERVATIVES TO TASK FOR
MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE MOTION TO PASS THROUGH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS JEREMY DOESN'T ENGAGE IN THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL DESTRUCTION HE LEAVES THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE I'M NOT GOING TO BE HARSH ABOUT TONY BLAIR HE HAS DESTROYED HIS OWN REPUTATION THERE'S NO QUESTION OF THE BLAIR BROWN GOVERNMENT DID SOME AMAZING THINGS IN PREFERENCE IN SCHOOLS HOSPITALS AND THE REST OF IT BUT THEIR REPUTATION HAS BLED TO DEATH IN THE SANDS OF IRAQ
HOW SHOULD TONY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NEXT TO TONY BLAIR THERE'S TALK ABOUT PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS BY THEIR FAMILIES THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING FOR FOR WAR CRIMES PROSECUTIONS AND IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE BUT WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
THE FAMILY IS THE HEART OF THIS REALLY THEY ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS FORWARD WE WAIT TO SEE WHAT LEGAL ADVICE THEY KAT BUT JEREMY AND
I WILL AND OTHERS WILL STAND WITH YOUR FAMILY
OF DECEASED SOLDIERS AS WE HAVE DONE THROUGHOUT ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW IT IS THE WAY THAT IT HAS UNDERMINES PEOPLE CONFIDENCE IN POLITICS ANOTHER SAY WHO I AM WHICH TONY BLAIR HAS
TRASHED HIS OWN REPUTATION WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE PROSECUTIONS THOUGH OR DO YOU FEEL THAT WITH THE CHILCOTT REPORT THIS IS THE OFFICIAL VERDICT ON WHAT HAPPENED IT IS TIME TO DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND I THINK THE CHILCOTT REPORT IS EXCELLENT REPORT WHICH HAS
DETAILED WHAT HAPPENED BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT CALLING FOR VENGEFUL PROSECUTIONS THIS IS ABOUT SUPPORTING THE FAMILIES AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THE NOTION THAT THE CORRECT POSTURE FOR THE BRITISH IS ALWAYS TO BE ROBIN TO UNITED STATES BATMAN
BUT WHAT DID WHEN YOU AND JERRY COULDN'T HAVE DISCUSSED THIS AND CLEARLY IN THE END GIVEN THIS OFFICIAL VERDICT ON THIS YOU'VE ENDED UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF OF HISTORY AND BEING AMONG THOSE WHO VOTED AGAINST THE WAR AT THE TIME DID DID DID YOU CONSIDER WHETHER THIS WAS THE MOMENT TO GO FURTHER IN THE RESPONSE
I THINK SO ME MADE THE RESPONSE HE WANTED TO MAKE YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE VICTIMS HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE CATASTROPHE FOR THE REGION IT'S FOR OTHERS IN WESTMINSTER PLAY WESTMINSTER GAMES WE WANT TO TAKE THIS FORWARD AND IN PARTICULAR WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY AND WOULD DO IT WHEN YOU HAD TONY BLAIR EARLIER ON AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID WAS THAT I MEAN NOT NOT JUST THAT HE STANDS BY THE DECISION HE TOOK THAT IN HIS VIEW THE STRUGGLE
WAS NOT IN VAIN I DON'T THINK I MEAN I'VE AS PART OF MY OLD JOB SINCE LARSON DEVELOPMENT I TRAVELLED TO REFUGEE CAMPS IN GREYS AREN'T IN FRANCE AND I STUDIED WHAT'S BEEN IN THE LEBANON STUDY WHAT'S HUNTER SO IN A FRUIT JUICE AND SOME OF THE CHAOS IN THE REGION AND FOR TONY BLAIR TO SAY THE STRUGGLE WAS NOT IN VAIN FOR JESSE HASN'T REALLY CLOSELY EXAMINED THE CHAOS THAT WAS UNLEASHED BY THE ORIGINAL ILL FATED TO FIT
DECISION BY HIMSELF AND GEORGE BUSH DO YOU GO INTO A RATHER YOU HOLD THEM BOTH RESPONSIBLE FOR WEE WHAT YOU REFER TO IS CHAOS FORM FOR ALL OF IT THERE'S NO QUESTION
THAT THAT ILL FATED INTERVENTION BY BLAIR AND BUSH PRECIPITATE IT SOME OF THE CHAOS WE SEE IN THE REACH INTO THERE JUST HAVE A FINE FINAL THOUGHT ON ON WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THERE IN THE LABOUR PARTY AND THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGE TO THEM TO MISTER CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP
HAVE YOU SEEN IT OFF DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW ARE STILL WAITING FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE WHEN WE WHEN THEY PUT UP A CHALLENGE AND WE HAVE A LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND HOW DOES IT FEEL IN THE SHADOW CABINET OF SORT OF RATHER DEPOPULATED SHADOW CATTLE IT'S A GREAT SHADOW CABINET AND THE ORIGINAL LOOK AT THE THE KIND OF BLAIR CABINETS AND THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN A BUNCH OF HABIT ALWAYS ACTUALLY RATHER BLOATED THEM AS A MEANS OF KIND PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT IT'S A GREAT SET A CAP NO WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY INTERESTING TO DISCUSSION
DIANE ABBOTT SHADOW HEALTH SECRETARY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED FROM CHILCOTT ABOUT TO UP OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND THE WAY THEY WORK THE FUTURE FOR THE RACKET SAMPLE I'M GOING BY TWO
EXTREMELY SEASONED HERSELF FORGIVE THE WORD JOURNALIST PETER TAYLOR PRESENTER OF PANORAMA IRAQ THE SPIES WHO FOOLED THE WORLD THAN THAT PROGRAMME TOLD THE STORY OF FIELD INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE THERE WAS TALK A BIT ABOUT THAT AND CHRISTINA LAMB SUNDAY TIMES FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT WHO WAS IN IRAQ FROM MARCH TO SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND FREE IN THOSE MONTHS AFTER THE WAR WENT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN SHE'D WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT OR FAREWELL KABUL AND THAT ACTUALLY YOU CAN EXPLAIN WHAT THE CONNECTION THERE IS CHRISTINA
THIS IS THE STATE OF IRAQ AS WE SPEAK
YES I MEAN THAT YOU LISTENED TO TONY BLAIR'S SAYING THE STRUGGLE WAS NOT IN VAIN I WISH SHE COULD GO WITH ME ON ONE OF MY TRIPS AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST SO MANY OF THEIR FAMILY WHO CAN'T GO CAN'T SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S NO SECURITY
YOU GO TO THESE PLACES AND YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY WISH SADDAM WAS STILL THERE AND THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING THE FEEL THAT PEOPLE THINK IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE A DICTATOR WHO WAS DOING THESE AWFUL THINGS THAN THIS COMPLETE CHAOS THAT THEY HAVE TODAY WHERE YOU GO OUT IN THE MORNING AND YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK AT NIGHT BUT YOU HEARD TONY BLAIR SAYING THE MOMENTS AGO IN THAT LONG INTERVIEW
THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD HE SAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY SAY THAT I MEAN
LIVING IN THOSE COUNTRIES IS IT WE'VE GOT ALL THESE INTERVENTIONS IRAQ AFGHANISTAN LIBYA WHERE CERTAINLY IN IRAQ AND LIBYA MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF WE HAD NEVER INTERVENED TO SAVE THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
ARE BETTER THAN WE'VE DONE IT SO I THINK IT IS REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE PEOPLE'S LIVES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY RUINED SO MANY YOU'VE SEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND KILLED IN IRAQ
THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IF WE HADN'T ENTERED IRAQ AND WHEN THEY WERE LIVING UNDER A DICTATORSHIP OF COURSE IS A HORRIBLE SITUATION AND PEOPLE WERE BEING BRUTALLY MURDERED AND TERRIBLE THINGS WERE HAPPENING BUT YOU KNOW FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE IF YOU DIDN'T PUT YOUR HEAD UP ABOVE THE PARAPET IN THEIR LIFE WENT ON AS YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THOSE
BUT WHAT HIS WORDS I MEAN SECURITY IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING AND YOU KNOW I BEFORE ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED I THOUGHT THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS TO HAVE FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND BE ABLE TO EXPRESS YOURSELF AND NOW HAVING COVERED THESE COUNTRIES IN CONFLICT
MANY YEARS I WONDER BECAUSE IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT SECURITY IF YOU CAN'T SEND YOUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING KNOWING THAT THEY'LL COME BACK AGAIN IN THE EVENING THEN I'M NOT SURE THAT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY IDEALLY YOU HAVE EVERYTHING THERE IF YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A CHOICE PIECE PETER THE ROLE OF THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
THERE WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT A MONUMENTAL FAILURE OF INTELLIGENCE BUT IT WASN'T JUST THE INTELLIGENCE ITSELF IT WAS TONY BLAIR HAS JUST BEEN DISCUSSING WITH YOU IT WAS THE FAILURE OF TONY BLAIR AND THOSE AROUND HIM TO INTERROGATE THE INTELLIGENT HAD TO INTERROGATE THE INTELLIGENCE THAT HE WAS BEING GIVEN
AND THAT ACTUALLY STARTS AT THE VERY BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND TO WHEN ALASTAIR CAMPBELL AND TONY BLAIR RIGHT THE DOSSIER WHICH IS DESIGNED TO CONVINCE THE BRITISH PEOPLE THAT THE DANGER WAS CLEAR AND PRESENT THAT THE INTELLIGENCE WAS ABSOLUTELY ROCK SOLID IN FACT THAT INTELLIGENCE WAS BASED ON A SERIES OF REPORTS FROM THE JOINT INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WHO ARE SIMULATED ALL THE MATERIAL FOR MY M.I.SIX M.I.FIVE AND G.C.H.Q.
THE CRITICAL THING IS THAT THERE WAS INTELLIGENCE REPORTS WERE HEAVILY QUALIFIED AND THOSE REPORTS SAY THINGS LIKE THE INTELLIGENCE IS SPORADIC AND PATCHY THE INTELLIGENCE REMAINS LIMITED THERE'S VERY LITTLE INTELLIGENCE RELATING TO IRAQ'S CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAMME NOW ALL THOSE QUALIFICATIONS WERE OMITTED AND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY OMITTED FROM THEIR FINAL REPORT THAT WAS DESIGNED TO CONVINCE
THE BRITISH PEOPLE THAT IT WAS A JUSTIFIED OPERATION TO GO TO WAR AGAINST SADDAM HUSSEIN IT'S ALWAYS SURPRISE ME THAT THAT NOBODY IN THE JOIN EACH OTHER'S COMMITTEE OR SIR JOHN SCARLETT NEVER SAID TO TONY BLAIR PRIME MINISTER IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE THIS INTELLIGENCE YOU CANNOT USE IT IN THIS KIND OF DOCUMENT WITHOUT INCLUDING THOSE CRITICAL QUALIFICATIONS WHICH ARE IN OUR INTELLIGENCE AND THE FAILURE TO DO THAT I THINK IS IS IS IS IS DISGRACEFUL
WOULD BLAIR SHOULD YOU HEARD HIM YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID AT THEM A MINUTE AGO HE WAS A GOOD SHOOT SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE INTERROGATED THAT INTELLIGENCE MUCH MORE CAREFULLY CANNA LEHMAN DO THAT
WELL IF HE CAN GO BACK AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT IT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS I THINK IS M.I.SIX IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE SOURCE WHO SELLING THESE THINGS ONE OF THE SOURCES TURNED OUT TO BE A COMPLETE LOONY
WELL THERE'S ALL THE SAUCES ON MOST OF THE SOURCES IN THE END BY TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER AT WORK WERE DISMISSED BY HIM I SO THAT PARTICULAR CHAP WASN'T HE I MEAN HE ACTUALLY GOT HIS INFORMATION FROM A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THAT'S THE SENSE IN WHICH I USE THAT RATHER UNPLEASANT WORD IT'S
IT'S A TRAGIC COMEDY IF YOU LIKE BUT THAT PARTICULAR SOURCE CAUSE GREAT EXCITEMENT IT WAS THAT SOURCE REFERRED TO AS THE NEW SOURCE ON TRIAL THAT LED TO SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE RUSHING TO NUMBER TEN DOWNING STREET PRESUMABLY EXCITED BECAUSE HE HAD THIS NEW SOURCE WHICH PROMISED SO MUCH IN FACT THAT SAUCE WAS NEVER
A SOURCE DIRECTLY CONTACTED BY M.I.SIX IT WAS A SUBSIDIARY SOURCE AND THAT INTELLIGENCE WAS DEPENDING ON ANOTHER SUB SOURCE ANOTHER SUB SOURCE SO IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND
DID TONY BLAIR EVER ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE OR SIMPLY DID HE TAKE IT AS READ BECAUSE THE INTELLIGENCE FITTED HIS AGENDA THE SAME HAPPENED WITH PRESIDENT BUSH THEY HAD BOTH TONY BLAIR AND PRESIDENT BUSH HAD AN AGENDA THAT AGENDA WAS HEAVILY BASED ON THE INTELLIGENCE THEY RECEIVED AND THEY DID NOT QUESTION THAT INTELLIGENCE THE INTELLIGENCE AS CHILCOTT SO DEVASTATINGLY POINTS OUT
WAS FALSE CHRISTINA WOULD YOU EXPECT THIS REPORTER HAVE ANY INFLUENCE AT ALL ON THE WAY WE BEHAVE NOW IN SYRIA
I HOPE THAT IT HAS EFFECTS IN GENERAL ON A MAYBE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'D LIKE TO SEE A BIT MORE YOU NEED LESSONS LEARNT FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE IN ALL OF THESE INTERVENTIONS IS IT'S NOT DIFFICULT FOR A SUPERIOR WESTERN MILITARY TO TOPPLE ONE OF THESE REGIMES WE DO IT QUICKLY THREE WEEKS TO TOPPLE THE SADDAM REGIME SIMILE WITH TALIBAN AND GADDAFI
THE PROBLEM IS WHAT YOU DO AFTERWARDS AND THAT TO ME WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF GOING INTO IRAQ AFGHANISTAN ON LIBYA BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLANNED FOR AFTERWARDS AND I YOU BEFORE THE WAR IN IRAQ
INTERVIEWED LOTS OF PEOPLE AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE ASKED THEM WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR AFTERWARDS AND NOBODY WOULD TELL ME AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE BEING SECRETIVE IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT HE HAD NO PLAN WHATSOEVER AND HE'D BE IN BASRA AFTER THE BRITISH HAD TAKEN IT AND TO SEE ALL THE LOOTING AND THE BRITISH DOING NOTHING IT WAS AWFUL
INDEED CHRISTINA EXCUSE ME PETER TAYLOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S ALL FROM US OUR EDITORS TODAY WERE DAVE MCMULLEN AND MALLS AFTER THE NEWS MELVYN BRAGG AND IN OUR TIME FROM ALL OF US GOOD MORNING
B.B.C. NEWS AT NINE O'CLOCK TONY BLAIR SAID HE STILL BELIEVES IT WAS RIGHT TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ DESPITE SCATHING CRITICISM OF THE DECISION IN THE CHILCOTT REPORT THE ENQUIRY FOUND THE GOVERNMENT HAD JOINED THE U.S. LED INVASION IN TWO THOUSAND THREE ON THE BASIS OF FLAWED INTELLIGENCE AND THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD NOT POSED AN IMMEDIATE THREAT
SPEAKING ON TODAY HERE ON RADIO FOUR MY BLAIR SAID HE REGRETTED THE MISTAKES MADE IN IRAQ AND TOOK FULL RESPONSIBILITY BUT THE ACTION SHOULD BE JUDGED BY THE FACT THE WORLD WAS A BETTER PLACE WITHOUT SADDAM AND HE REJECTED THE SUGGESTION THAT HE HAD FAILED TO CHALLENGE THE INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE HE'D ALREADY DECIDED THAT THE IRAQI LEADER SHOULD BE DEPOSED I RELIED ON THE ASSESSMENTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO ME BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY CERTAINLY GIVEN OUR EXPERIENCE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER YES D'YOU HAVE TO HAVE A THEM MORE MORE CLEARLY BUT IT WASN'T THAT I WANTED TO BELIEVE IT I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT OF COURSE IS THAT SEVEN THE SAYING THEY ACTUALLY USE THESE WEAPONS AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE THE REMAINING THREE CANDIDATES TO BE THE NEXT CONSERVATIVE LEADER AND PRIME MINISTER WILL GO TO A FINAL VOTE OF M.P.S TODAY EITHER THERESA MAY MICHAEL GO FOR ANDREA LEAD SOME WILL BE KNOCKED OUT WITH THE OTHER TWO BEING PUT ON A BALLOT FOR PARTY MEMBERS
