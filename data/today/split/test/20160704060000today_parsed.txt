HAS LED TO A KIND OF HYSTERIA THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE SAYS HE WANTS TO CUT CORPORATION TAX TO LESS THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT TO HELP BRITAIN ATTRACT NEW INVESTMENT AND ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME
# DO YOU KNOW GOES INTO ORBIT AROUND JUPITER WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH THIS REALLY NASTY HAZARDOUS REGION FOR RADIATION BELTS THAT ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE PLANET AND THEY ARE NASTY
# THE EXTREME CONDITIONS FACING THE PROBE AND JULIE AS FINALLY AFTER A FIVE YEAR JOURNEY IT APPROACHES JUPITER AND COULD WE BE SAYING THE DEATH OF THE DEAD SEA SCIENTIST SAID SHRINKING ALARMING RATE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM
IN THE PAST GEOLOGISTS WERE LOOKING AT A VERY ANCIENT FEATURES TO OUR AT UNDERSTAND HOW THEY FORMED HERE WITH THOSE FEATURES FORMING IN FRONT OF OUR EYES THE C. NEWS READ BY SUSAN
# BORIS JOHNSON HAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF BEING TOO SLOW TO EXPLAIN HOW THE VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD BE MADE TO WORK IN THE INTERESTS OF THE U.K. AND EUROPE WRITING IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. SAYS THAT HYSTERIA HAS BROKEN OUT AMONG SOME REMAIN VOTERS AND THEY NEED REASSURANCE THAT THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT ONE OF MY JOHNSON'S ANNALISE HAS CLAIMED THAT THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GORE WAS UNFIT TO BE PRIME MINISTER HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN
BORIS JOHNSON SUGGESTS THE NEGATIVE PORTRAYAL OF BRITAIN OUTSIDE THE E.U. HAS LED TO A KIND OF HYSTERIA SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH FOLLOWED THE DEATH OF THE PRINCESS OF WALES HE CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE GOVERNMENT STATEMENT OF BASIC TRUTHS ABOUT LEAVING THE E. U. IN RESPONSE DOWNING STREET SAID ACTION HAD BEEN TAKEN TO REASSURE MARKETS AND A WHITEHALL UNIT WOULD PRODUCE PROPOSALS FOR BRITAIN'S WITHDRAWAL

BEN WALLACE WRITES IN EXCORIATING CRITIQUE OF MICHAEL GAVE HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF BETRAYING MISTER JOHNSON BY RUNNING FOR THE LEADERSHIP THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS MISTER GAVE COULD BE A SECURITY RISK AS PRIME MINISTER BECAUSE OF AN EMOTIONAL NEED TO GOSSIP PARTICULARLY AFTER DRINKING ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE CLAIMS A SPOKESMAN FOR MY SAID ONLY WE WISH BEN WALLIS WELL

# THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS PROPOSED A TAX CUT FOR BUSINESS AS PART OF PLANS TO ENCOURAGE MORE INVESTMENT IN THE U.K. FOLLOWING THE VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. MISTER OSBORNE TORE THE FINANCIAL TIMES HE WANTED TO REDUCE CORPORATION TAX FROM TWENTY TO LESS THAN FIFTEEN PER CENT HE'S ALREADY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO LOWER THE RATE TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT IN TWENTY TWENTY IS OUR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT FEEL LEG IT
BEFORE THE REFERENDUM GEORGE OSBORNE SAID THAT A VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD FORCE HIM TO INTRODUCE BILLIONS OF POUNDS' WORTH OF TAX INCREASES IN SPENDING CUTS IN ORDER TO REPAIR DAMAGE TO THE PUBLIC FINANCES IT'S NOW CLEAR THAT HIS REAL STRATEGY IS VERY DIFFERENT
THE PROPOSED CUT CORPORATION TAX WHICH WOULD GIVE THE U.K. ONE OF THE LOWEST RATES OF ANY MAJOR ECONOMY IS DESIGNED TO HELP THE COUNTRY ATTRACT NEW INVESTMENT IN COURT BUSINESSES WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN PUT OFF BY THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE COUNTRY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. HOWEVER IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN SUCH A CUT WOULD ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED
# A BRITISH LAW FIRM AS LIKE LAUNCHING A CHALLENGE TO PREVENT THE GOVERNMENT FROM INVOKING ARTICLE FIFTY TO TRIGGER THE PROCESS OF LEAVING THE E.U.

B. C. INVESTIGATION FIVE YEARS AGO WOULD BE COLLECTED THEY'RE STILL IN USE ACROSS BAGHDAD
# TRADE UNIONS ARE CLAIMING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN PERMISSION TO THE BELEAGUERED SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY TO CANCEL ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TRAINS A DAY STARTING NEXT WEEK SERVICES HAVE BEEN SEVERELY DISRUPTED FOR WEEKS BY STRIKE ACTION AND A SHORTAGE OF TRAINED CREWS SOUTHERN RAILWAY SAYS IT'LL CONFIRM DETAILS OF A TEMPORARY TIMETABLE LATER THIS WEEK

# THAT BORIS JOHNSON ARTICLE IN THE TELEGRAPH IS STRIKING STRIKING POVERTY MAKES NO REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT HE THOUGHT OF BECOMING LEADER OF HIS PARTY AND LEADER OF THE COUNTRY NO MENTION MICHAEL GO HE DOES INSTEAD FOCUS ON WHAT HE SAYS IS A KIND OF HYSTERIA A CONTAGIOUS MORNING OF THE KIND THAT I REMEMBER IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AFTER THE DEATH OF THE PRINCESS OF WALES HE SAYS THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE CROWDED OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE OR SHOUTING ABUSE AT HIM EACH MORNING
ARE EXPERIENCING THE LAST PSYCHOLOGICAL TREMORS OR PROJECT FEAR PERHAPS THE MOST THOROUGH GOING GOVERNMENT ATTEMPT TO MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION SINCE THE RUN UP TO THE IRAQ WAR
# LOTS MORE OF COURSE ON THE RACE TO BE ON EX PRIME MINISTER ON THE FRONT PAGES THE TIMES HAS UKIP ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO INSTALL LED SOME AS P.M. THIS IS BECAUSE THE PRINCIPAL DONOR TO NIGEL FARROW SAYS HE IS NOW BACKING ANDREA LEGEND BID TO GET IN THERE RUN OFF WITH THERESA MAY AND THE FRONT PAGE THE AYE AYE HAS PICTURES OF THEM BOTH SAYING BOYS BOYS TORIES EDGED TOWARDS A TWO WOMAN CONTEST FOR PRIME MINISTER THE GUARDIAN IT'S MORE INTERESTED ON ITS FRONT PAGE IN LABOUR'S LEADERSHIP
# PROBLEMS LABOUR M.P.S SUPPORTING JEREMY CORBIN THE GARDAI SAYS IN ITS LEAD STORY ARE URGENTLY SEEKING WAYS TO AVOID AN HISTORIC SPLIT AFTER THEIR LEADERS' REFUSAL TO RESIGN SET THE PARTY ON TRACK FOR A FEROCIOUS LEADERSHIP BATTLE THEY SIGHT LEN MCCLUSKEY FROM UNITED INTERVIEW YESTERDAY ON ANDREW MARR IN WHICH HE DESCRIBED THE ATTEMPTED COUP AS HE PUT IT AS A POLITICAL LYNCHING OF A DECENT MAN BUT ALSO SAID THAT COOGAN WAS A MAN OF STEEL AND THE GUARDIAN SAYS
THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS OF COOLING OFF BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES SOME CORBIN ALLIES DISCUSSING PLANS TO WIN OVER THE M.P.S WHO HAVE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN JEREMY CORBIN UNDER ONE PLAN DISCUSSED BY A LEFT LEANING M.P.S THE GUARDIAN SAYS MY COOGAN WOULD BECOME CHAIRMAN RATHER THAN SUPREME LEADER THE PHRASE KITCHEN CABINET HAS BEEN USED TO DESCRIBE A COLLECTIVE STYLE OF LEADERSHIP IN WHICH ADVISERS WOULD RUN OPERATIONS OR DO RUN OPERATIONS ALONGSIDE THE LEAD
# THE DAILY MAIL IS VERY UPSET BY TONY BLAIR OR MORE SPECIFICALLY AS IT SAYS IN ITS HEADLINE ARMIES FURY AT IRAC STITCH UP COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE CHILCOTT REPORT INTO THE IRAQ WAR IS PUBLISHED IN A PAPER REPORTS THAT THE CHILCOTT REPORT WILL NOT BE USED TO PROSECUTE TONY BLAIR FOR WAR CRIMES THAT'S BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT SAID THAT WAS NOT PART OF ITS REMIT BUT THAT SOLDIERS COULD BE PROSECUTED FOR THEIR ALLEGED WAR CRIMES
# THE DAILY MIRROR AMONG PAPER SAYING SOLAR POWER IS HITTING RECORD LEVELS IN THE U.K. GENERATED USES ODD REALLY GIVEN PLUS HUNG AS BEING THAT ANYWAY IT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN THE PAPERS GENERATED ALMOST A QUARTER OF OUR ELECTRICITY AT ONE POINT LAST MONTH
# IT IS NOW TEN PAST SIX NOW THE FRONT PAGE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS A STRIKING HEADLINE OSBORNE PUTS CORPORATION TAX CUTS AT THE HEART OF A BRICKS IT RECOVERY PLAN WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED TO THAT EMERGENCY WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALLED A PUNISHMENT BUDGET WHICH HE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE REFERENDUM ANDY VERITY ARE ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE MORNING TO AND THEY SOUND VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE WERE PROMISED OR THREATENED WITH
ON THE FIFTEENTH OF JUNE WE WERE TOLD THEY'D BE FIFTEEN BILLION POUNDS OF TAX RISES INCOME TAX WILL GO UP TO TWENTY TWO PERCENT HIGHER RATE TAX OF FORTY THREE PERCENT BOOZE WILL GET MORE EXPENSIVE SO WOULD FUEL CUTS TO THE N.H.S. SCHOOLS AND DEFENCE AND HE SAID THAT HE'D HAVE TO TEAR APART HIS MANIFESTO PROMISE NOW HE HAS DONE THAT BUT NOT IN THE WAY HE SAID HE'S TEARING ABOUT A DIFFERENT MANIFESTO PROMISE THE ONE HE'S BEEN GOING ON ABOUT SINCE TWENTY TEN WHICH SAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE BUDGET
INTO SURPLUS BY TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S THE ONE THAT HE'S GONE THE CORPORATION TAX IS INTERESTING BECAUSE HE WAS PLANNING TO CUT THAT ANYWAY DOWN TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT HE WAS TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT BACK IN TWENTY TEN AND IT'S DROPPED TO TWENTY PER CENT NOW THERE'S A QUESTION HERE IS THAT STIMULUS DOESN'T ACTUALLY HELP COMPANIES AND ATTRACT INVESTMENT AS IRELAND FOR EXAMPLE IS DOWN WITH ITS CORPORATION TAX RATE AND THE ANSWER IS SORT OF YES AND NO BECAUSE CORPORATION TAX RECEIPTS
HAVEN'T REALLY GONE UP THAT MUCH THEY'VE COME DOWN MORE OR LESS OVER THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS THE THEORY IS IF YOU CUT INTO THE BONE AND YOU GET MORE REVENUE COS YOU GET MORE COMPANIES BUT SO FAR THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HAPPENING TO BE FAIR TO MISTER OSBORNE ISN'T THIS ATTEMPTED TO STIMULUS ATTEMPT AT A BROOK SIGNPOST SAYING BRITAIN STILL OPEN TO BUSINESS BECAUSE HE WANTS TO AVOID ALL THOSE TAX RISES AND SPENDING CUTS WHICH COULD STILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE AUTUMN STATE
YES I MEAN THERE WAS ALWAYS A BIT OF A TENSION BETWEEN SAYING ON THE ONE HAND THERE BE A RECESSION ON AND ON THE OTHER HAND THERE BE TAX RISES ANY GOVERNMENT FACED WITH THE PROSPECT OF A DEFLATING ECONOMY IN A BIG ECONOMIC SHOCK LIKE BRECHT'S IT IS WOULD WANT TO TRY TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY
FOR EXAMPLE BY CUTTING TAXES OR BY RAISING SPENDING AND AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING HERE REVEALING THAT THE TOP CONCERN REALLY IS WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT THEY'RE INTERESTING QUESTIONS MAKE LIKE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE APPRENTICESHIP LEVY HE BROUGHT IN LAST YEAR WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO RAISE THREE BILLION POUNDS FROM BUSINESSES AND SLAP A HALF A PER CENT ATTACKS ON PAYROLLS OVER THREE MILLION WILL HE REALLY WANT TO DO THAT IF WE ARE HEADING FOR SOME SORT OF A RECESSION
AND WILL IT BE HIM WILL DISCOVER THAT SOON ENOUGH COS I DON'T SOMEHOW THAT MISTER OSBORNE IS LIKELY TO BE DELIVERING THE NEXT BUDGET HE MIGHT BUT I DOUBT ANDY VERITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH NICK THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX JUNO THE SPACECRAFT LAUNCHED FIVE YEARS AGO HAS BEEN TRAVELLING WELL EVERY INCH OF THE WAY
# JUPITER AND HAS ARRIVED EXTRAORDINARY IT'S A BILLION AND A HALF MILES WELL YOU'VE BEEN FUSSING WITH OUR EARTHLY CONCERNS IT HAS BEEN CARRYING ON ITS JOURNEY AND REBECCA MORALE OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT IN PASADENA IT'S BEING MONITORED FROM REBECCA WHEN I SAY IT'S A RIDE I IT HE'S PRETTY MUCH THERE ISN'T IT BUT BUT THERE ARE A FEW CRUCIAL THINGS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN
YEAH IT'S REALLY NEARLY THERE IT'S CLOSING IN FAST ON JUPITER WHICH NASA IS NOW DESCRIBING AS THE BIGGEST BADDEST PLANET IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM IT'S BEEN ON THIS EPIC JOURNEY TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION KILOMETRES FIVE YEARS TO GET THERE
BUT THE NEXT PART OF ITS MISSION IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT ESSENTIALLY IT'S TRAVELLING VERY VERY QUICKLY AT THE MOMENT AND TO BE SUCKED INTO ORBITS AROUND YOU BY THE IMMENSE
GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AROUND KEEPS IT ESSENTIALLY HAD TO SLAM ON ITS BRAKES AND IT DOES THIS BY BURNING ITS ENGINE FOR EXACTLY THIRTY FIVE MINUTES NOW IT DOES THIS ON AUTOPILOT BECAUSE IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FOR SCIENTIST TO BE CHATTING TO HIM CONTROLLING IT FROM HERE ON EARTH SO IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG WITH THIS ENGINE BURN IF IT DOESN'T BURN FOR LONG ENOUGH FOR THE COMPUTERS RESET THEMSELVES
IT WON'T BE HEADING FOR ORBIT AROUND JUPITER IT'S GOING TO BE BOUNCING BACK OUT INTO DEEP SPACE SO THERE'S A REAL MIX OF MISSION CONTROL OF KIND OF EXCITEMENT ALSO QUITE A FEW LOOKING SORT OF NERVOUS SCIENTISTS AROUND TO WHEN WE'RE GOING TO KNOW
WELL IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS AT FOUR EIGHTEEN IN THE MORNING TOMORROW SO IF THAT'S OUR TIME UP EARLY YET YEAH I'LL TIME YOU GET U.K. TIME SO IT'S ACTUALLY
WE'LL BE INDEPENDENT STATE HERE IN THE STATES COS WE'RE BEHIND SO YEAH HAPPENS OVERNIGHT SO THAT IT WILL IT WILL GO INTO ORBIT BUT THEN ACTUALLY THINGS GET MORE DIFFICULT STILL BECAUSE JUPITER IS A HOSTILE WORLD IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO ENCOUNTER THE TERRIBLE WEATHER DOWN THERE THESE GIANT STORMS RAGING ON THE SURFACE THE GREAT RED SPOT I MEAN THAT'S A STORM TWICE THE SIZE OF THE EARTH THAT HAS BEEN RAGING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS BUT THE RADIATION IS THE REALLY TRICKY THING BECAUSE ALL THE WHILE IT'S IN ORBITS IF IT DOES GET INTO ORBIT AROUND JUPITER IS GOING TO BE BLASTED
WITH CHARGED PARTICLES WHICH ARE GONNA BE CONSTANTLY BOMBARDING THE SPACECRAFT SO ALL OF THE INSTRUMENTS SHIELDED BY A THICK TITANIUM CASE BUT EVEN SO IT'S GONNA BE QUITE A SHORT MISSION AND SOME OF THESE INSTRUMENTS MIGHT MIGHT FAIL WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF IT ACTUALLY GOING INTO ORBIT SO IT'S IT'S A HOSTILE WORLD BUT HE'S GOING TO
# REBECCA THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORE ON JUNO DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME BACK AMARAL REPORTING PASADENA IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX WILL BRITAIN JOINED FORCES WITH THE GERMANS THIS MORNING THAT'S THE QUESTION ABOUT THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE WHERE SHAREHOLDERS ARE GONNA VOTE ON A TWENTY BILLION POUND MERGER WITH THEIR GERMAN RIVALS HIT TELL US ABOUT THAT AND THE REST OF THE BUSINESS NEWS DOMINIC A COM THANK YOU MUCH LIKE YES THE TWO COMPANIES INVOLVED THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE IN ITS BIG GERMAN COUNTERPART DEUTSCHE BURSAR
INSISTS THAT THE E.U. REFERENDUM RESULT WILL NOT AFFECT THE PLAN MERGER WILL THEY MIGHT BE RIGHT BUT THERE ARE SIGNS THAT THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES ARE NOT HAPPY THE PLAN WAS TO HAVE THE LEGAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE COMPANY HERE IN BRITAIN WHICH HAS MADE THE GERMAN FINANCIAL WATCHDOG RATHER UNEASY IT'S ASKING PERHAPS UNDERSTANDABLY HOW THE MOST IMPORTANT EXCHANGE IN EUROPE CAN BE RUN FROM OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU GET THE FEELING THAT POLITICS COULD STILL PLAY A BIG PART IN THE STEEL HERE'S WHAT JONATHAN BE STILL SENIOR CORPORATE PARTNER OF THE LAW FIRM PINSENT MASON HAD TO SAY TO B. B. C. WILL TEE VEE
THIS MERGER IS A LONG TIME IN THE PLANNING IT WASN'T CONDITIONAL UPON A POSITIVE VOTE IN THE REFERENDUM AND ISN'T SET TO CLOSE UNTIL THE FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR THERE'S NO CONDITIONS THIS MERGER RELATED RACE THAT VOTE I MEAN HE'S ALWAYS BEEN AT THIS COMPETITION BETWEEN FRANKFORT LONDON AND INDEED PARIS HAS TO
WHICH OF THEM IS IS THE LEADER AND IN LONDON HAS BEEN PRE EMINENT FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND HOPE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO BUT THAT PRESSURE CERTAINLY INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THIS VOTE NOT LEAST BECAUSE I THINK THIS CLOT DISCOMFORT THE IDEA OF A BUREAU TRAITS BEING SETTLED MAINLY LONDON AND YET NOT BEING PART OF THE
TALK ABOUT THAT AND THE REST OF THE MARKETS USED DAVID COMING HE'D HAVE U.K. EQUITIES AT STANDARD LIFE INVESTMENTS IS EDINBURGH STUDIOS GOOD MORNING DAVID MORNING THE THIS THE VOTE TODAY IS FOR THE BRITISH SHAREHOLDERS STOCK EXCHANGE THERE'S A GENERAL FEELING THAT IT WILL GO THROUGH O.K.
I THINK IT'S VERY LIVELY APPROVE THE DEAL OF THE GERMAN STILL HAVE TO VOTE AND TO BE HONEST I THINK THEY'LL APPROVE THE DEAL AS WELL BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT TEAMS FROM BOTH SIDES ARE SUPPORTIVE AND IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME IN COMING SO I THINK THAT WILL POTENTIALLY BE POLITICAL INTERFERENCE FROM GERMAN REGULATORS AND POLITICIANS BUT IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR TO ME THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY SCUPPER THE DEAL AS YOU MENTIONED THEY DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THEIR HEADQUARTERS IN LONDON BUT I THINK
UNLESS THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE I THINK THE DEAL WILL GO AHEAD ACTION IF IF THE WORST WORK WERE TO COME TO THE WORST AND THE GERMANS TURNED HER DOWN IT DOES SOME ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT FEATURES NO REASON WHY IT NEEDS
YEAH I THINK I THINK YOU'D PREFER TO BE A LARGER GROUP COULD STAY INDEPENDENT I THINK THERE'S A RISK IT COULD BE A BID FOR THE LOVELY ROLL HE'S DONE A FANTASTIC JOB AT THE OTHER SEE
A SIGNAL ANYWAY THE DEAL DOESN'T GO AHEAD I THINK THE COMPANY WOULD BE VULNERABLE FROM ANOTHER BID POSSIBLY THIS TIME FROM THE U.S. YES IT'S WORTH IT IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT THE AMERICANS ARE WAITING IN THE WINGS THEY HAVE LOOKED AT THE L.S.E. BEFORE
# IT'S MORE OF A BIGGER THEME WHICH IS ABOUT POLITICAL RISK THIS DEAL HAS SOME POLITICAL RISK YOUR JOT YOUR DAY JOB IS ALL ABOUT TALKING TO CHIEF EXECUTIVES WHAT DID THEY THINK ABOUT POLITICAL RISK AFTER THE BRICKS THAT REFERENDUM
I THINK THEY COME THE CONFIDENCE IS VERY FRAGILE AND PEOPLE WERE WORRIED AND COMPANIES ARE WORRIED AND PARTICULAR ABOUT THE RISK OF STAYING IN THE SINGLE MARKET BECAUSE SERVICE COME IS LIKE YOURSELVES AND EXPORTERS GOODS A SINGER MARK IS ABSOLUTELY KEY AND ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT TALKED ABOUT MUCH THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TARIFFS IF WE LEAVE THE SINGLE MARKET THE AVERAGE TURVES FIVE TO TEN PER CENT
IF YOU'RE FOR GOODS AND SERVICES WHEN THERE WERE DIFFICULT TO GET LICENCES EXCEPT FOR SOMETIMES A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SUS ASSUMPTION THAT WE CAN STAY IN THE SINGLE MARKET TARIFF IS A BIG ISSUE AND IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR WHETHER
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN OR STAND ON THAT I THINK BUSINESS IS LOOKING TO THAT SINGLE MARKET DEBATE AND FOCUSING ON WHAT THE OUTCOME IS BUT IN THE SHORT TERM THE HOLDING BACK INVESTMENT INTENTIONS THE FORKS AND TAKING DAY COURSE THE SORT OF BATTENING DOWN THE HATCHES HENCE AS CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISK OF GOING INTO RECESSION AND THE POLICY MEASURES WERE STARTING TO SEE COME OUT OF GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF CORPORATION TAX CUTS
ATTENTION ALL GOVERNMENT SPENDING EXCEPT DAVID THE BIG OBVIOUS INDICATORS FOR PEOPLE LISTENING THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED IN THE MARKETS HAVE BOUNCED BACK QUITE QUITE SHARPLY WHAT SOME WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WELL ALTHOUGH THE MARKET LAST WEEK THAT'S REALLY A FUNCTION OF THE STIRLING'S COLLAPSE STEPPING STONE OVER TEN PER CENT FORTY PERCENT OF THE FRUIT SOON HUNDREDS OR OVERSEAS IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY EXPOSED TO THE U.K. ECONOMY
BANKS TRAVEL AND LEISURE FACE BUILT THERE'S A LOT OF THOSE STALKS ARE STILL DAY OVER TWENTY PERCENT SINCE THE TWENTY SOLUTION THEY AT THOSE COMPANIES ARE WORRIED ABOUT RECESSION AND THE INVESTORS IN THOSE COMPANIES ARE WORRIED ABOUT RECESSION SO I THINK IT'S BEST TO LOOK AT
THE U.K. ECONOMY STIRLING'S A SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION HERE IN TERMS OF OF THE MARKET AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY ARGUE I THINK SO MARKETS OVER OVERPAYING FOR OVERSEAS EARNERS AT THE MOMENT BUT THERE WAS EXPOSED TO THE U.K. ECONOMY HAVE BEEN HIT A WEAK POUND THEM NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD THING
WE BAND IS NOT NECESSARILY GOOD THING BECAUSE IT PUSHES UP INFLATION INFLATION FORECASTS GO UP TO FOUR PER CENT FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHO PUSHES UP PETROL PRICES FOOD PRICE INFLATION AND CONSUMERS THEREFORE HAVE LESS CASH TO SPEND
THE BENEFITS TO EXPORTERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY CAN STAY IN THE SINGLE MARKET COS THERE'S A RISK OF TERRACE THAT BENEFITS IN TERMS OF LOWER EXPORT PRICING MIGHT NOT COME THROUGH SO
# AT THE MOMENT WEEK STIRLING'S NOT NECESSARILY POSITIVE FOR CONFIDENCE AND JUST ONE LAST QUICK POINT DAVID AND WE LOVE TALKING ABOUT MARKS AND SPENCER EVERYBODY HAS OF YOUR MARKS AND SPENCER WE HAVE A TRADING UPDATE LATER IN THE WRIST ARE YOU ARE YOU A BUYER OF MARKS AND SPENCER SHARES OR ARE YOU POSITIVE ABOUT MARKS AND SPENCER'S I THINK I'M IN A SHOW THAT WOMEN WILL NOT BE CALLED AS VERMINOUS I THINK THE SHIRAZ PARTLY GAME COS A RECESSION AND WE'VE TALKED MENTAL MENTION FOOD PRESENTATION
I THINK IT'S STILL DIFFICULT TO MAKE A POSITIVE CASE FOR M. AND S. AT THE MOMENT CONSUMERS GOING TO BE UNDER PRESSURE I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BECAUSE OF THE DISCOUNTERS WHETHER THEY CAN PUT PRICES UP AND FOOD I THINK THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT AS WELL AND THEY'VE STILL GOT TO RE PRICE IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCT THAT WAS GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE SOME MARGINS ARE COMIC ON THE PRESSURE THERE PLUS ANOTHER WEEK SUMMER IN TERMS OF WEATHER
THE NEW SEE YOU'RE STILL GOT AS WORK ER I'M AFRAID THANK YOU MUCH THEY BECOMING HEAD OF U.K. KRIS AT STANDARD LIFE INVESTMENT WELL MARKS AND SPENCER UNDER PRESSURE AND THERE ALSO SIGNS OF A WORRYING SLOW DOWN AMONG SMALL BUSINESSES A SURVEY OUT TODAY FROM THE FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH WAS COMPILED BEFORE THE REFERENDUM SHOWED THEIR CONFIDENCE WAS AT A FOUR YEAR LOW IT CLAIMS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF COMPANIES ARE PAYING TO CUT JOBS AND THE NUMBER PLANNING TO INVEST IS DOWN BY ALMOST ONE THIRD COMPARED TO A YEAR AGO
MY CHEERY HIS POLICY CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERATION OF SPORE BUSINESSES AND HE JOINS US MIKE WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THIS THIS FALLEN CONFIDENCE GIVEN THAT WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE REFERENDUM
CLEARLY IT IS NO SURPRISE IT'S THE THIRD QUARTER THAT IT'S DOWN AND IT'S ONLY JUST NOW INTO POSITIVE TERRITORY AND UNFORTUNATELY WILL SEE NORTHERN IRELAND AND INDEED LONDON VERY MUCH INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY ACCORDING TO THE INDEX
I THINK MANY OF THE REASONS ARE KNOWN NO SURPRISES IN SOME WAY AND THAT OF THE INCREASING COS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE FACED WITH AT THE MOMENT SO WE'VE HAD THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE HAVING TO MANAGE AND COPE WITH WE'VE SEEN CHANGES TO DIVIDEND TAXATION WE'VE GOT AUTO ENROLMENT TO CONTEND WITH AND THESE RIDING TO PRESSURE'S NOT JUST PURE COST BUT ALSO ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE FACED WITH
# AS YOU RIGHTLY SAY INVESTMENT INTENT IS NOW AT ITS LOWEST SINCE QUARTER THREE TWENTY TWELVE WE'VE GOT HAS A SAY THE INCREASE IN LABOUR COS BUT ALSO
BEFORE THE REFERENDUM WE HAD THIS PARALYSIS WITHIN GOVERNMENT SO NO DECISIONS WERE BEING TAKEN AND WERE CALLING ALONG WITH OTHERS FOR PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SO PARTICULARLY UP IN THE NORTH FOR THE TRANS PENNINE ROUTE TO REALLY GET ON AND DO IT WERE CALLING FOR DID SWOON STRICT INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ADVANCED THE ANNOUNCEMENT LAST WEEK TO PUT CAPACITY ON HOLD BY THE
HOLDING BACK ON THE DECISION ON HEATHROW OR GATWICK OR ANYWHERE QUITE FRANKLY IS NOT HELPFUL EITHER MY POTS ARE FEELING SINCE THE REFERENDUM WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF GREAT EXAMPLES IN THE PAPERS OF COMPANIES SAYING WE'VE GOT LOADS OF NEW EXPORT ORDERS BECAUSE THE PANDAS IS IT HAS FALLEN SO FAR WELL THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE WERE GETTING
SOME COMMENTS COMING BACK FROM SOME OF OUR MEMBERS THAT ACTUALLY WHILST THE SHORT TERM IS GOING TO CONTINUE AS IT WAS TO THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT
THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO MEAN WE'VE CALLED FOR THERE TO BE CONTINUED ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WHATEVER THAT FORM TAKES THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AS WE KNOW HAVE TO TAKE PLACE WE SHALL BE INPUTTING VERY MUCH ON BEHALF OF ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE
VIEWS ON THAT BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S UNKNOWN TERRITORY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MIKE CHERRY POLICY CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES STILL CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE BRICKS ABOUT MEANS FOR THE ARMY OF MIGRANT WORKERS WHO AND BRITAIN FILMS BRITISH COMPANIES OF COURSE RELY ON THOSE MIGRANT WORKERS IN A REPORT OUT THIS MORNING FROM THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATIONS
FROM THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION EXCUSE ME SAYS THEY NEED TO RE THINK WHAT THEY DO I'M JOINED BY TORSTEN BELL WHO'S A DIRECTOR OF THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION COURSE CAN YOU COME IN A BIT MORE ABOUT THE REPORT ON WHAT SING MOST USE MIGRANT LABOUR MOST WIN THIS BRICKS AT DEBATE WE'RE NOW MOVING FROM THE STAGE OF ABSTRACT POLITICS TO REAL FIRM'S DECISIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE IN THE COMING YEARS AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND A CONSENSUS FROM ALL THE CANDIDATES TO BE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTERS
A FOCUS ON BRINGING AN END TO FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WHICH WILL SEE A REDUCTION IN THE VOLUME OF MIGRATION FROM THE E.U. AND THAT WILL AFFECT JOBS BUT IT WON'T JUST AFFECT WHO DOES JOBS IT WILL AFFECT WHAT JOBS WE HAVE BECAUSE SOME SECTORS LIKE FOOD MANUFACTURING OR DOMESTIC SERVICE JOBS ARE VERY DEPENDENT ON MIGRATION UP TO A THIRD IN FOOD MANUFACTURING WORKERS ARE FROM THE E.U. AND THOSE FIRMS WILL HAVE TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT HOW THEY DO THEIR BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T JUST CARRY ON USING THE SAME APPROACH OF NEVERENDING LOOSE GOING O.K. JUST HAVE TO
PAY HIGHER WAGES SO SOME SECTORS MAY CHOOSE RESPOND BY PAYING HIGHER WAGES BUT IN THE LONGER TERM FUNK FIRMS WILL TEND TO RESPOND BY CHANGING HOW THEY DO THINGS THEY MAY HAVE ALSO PUT UP PRICES FOR EXAMPLE WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THERE ABOUT THE ABOUT FOOD MANUFACTURING WHAT OTHER SECTORS ARE REALLY AFFECTED THERE'S THE SERVICES IN THE N.H.S. IS A HUGE YUSRA MIGRANT LABOUR
THE N.H.S. IS A BIG USER OF MIGRANT LABOUR IN CERTAIN MEDICAL ROLES ALTHOUGH LOT OVERALL THE N.H.S. EMPLOYS BRITISH WORKERS THEY WERE MAYBE WE'RE NOT SAYING A THIRD WORKERS LIKE WE ARE WRITTEN IN FOOD MANUFACTURING AND ALSO THEY COME FROM ACROSS THE WORLD NOT JUST FROM THE E.U. AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE UNDER A MIGRATION BUT THE REAL QUESTION FOR FIRMS NOW IS HOW ARE THEY GOING TO RESPOND TO SOME FIRMS HAVE MORE OPTIONS THAN OTHERS SOME FIRMS
EMPLOY A GREATER USE OF TECHNOLOGY GREATER USE OF COMPUTERS DO YOU THINK THE LAST TWO YEARS BEING ALL OF US SCARED OFF BY THERE I DID THIS TOO MANY ROBOTS AROUND ONE OF THEIR RESPONSES BUT MAYBE LOOK WE NEED MORE ROBOTS IN THIS NEW WORLD AND THAT COULD DRIVE UP INVESTMENT THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR PRODUCTIVITY BRITAIN HASN'T SEEN ANY RISE AND PRODUCTIVITY SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THAT'S NOT A SIGN OF A WELL FUNCTIONING ECONOMY

ON AN INTERVENTION BY PHILIP HAMMOND WHO SAYS THAT THERE CAN BE NO TRICK THERE MUST BE A TRADE OFF HE SAYS BETWEEN FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WHY THIS MATTERS OF COURSE HE'S BACKING THERESA MAY WHY THIS MATTERS OF COURSE IS BECAUSE STOPPING FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WAS ACTUALLY THE CENTREPIECE OF THE BRICKS IT CAMPAIGN AND NOW THE CANDIDATE WHO SEEMS TO BE IN POLE POSITION IS BEING URGED
TO REACH SOME SORT OF DEAL OVER FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT INDEED IN HER SPEECH SELLING OUTER CASE TO BE LEADER THERESE MAY ACTUALLY INTIMATED THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME SORT OF DEAL AND I SUSPECT THAT WILL FUEL THE ANXIETY AMONG MANY BREAKS HER TEARS THAT HAVING A REMAIN PERSON AS THEIR LEADER MIGHT MEAN THEY DON'T GET THE SORT OF

THAT ACTUALLY WE DON'T NEED TO HANG AROUND TO TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY WE CAN PASS AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT GETTING US OUT BY CHRISTMAS NOW WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS THIS IS NOT JUST AN ARTICLE THERE IS A BODY OF TORY BRECHT'S SIT OPINION BEHIND THAT AND THERE IS A MOVE AMONGST TORY M.P.S JUST TO SPEED THIS WHOLE THING UP BECAUSE THEY SAY THERE'S NO POINT HANGING AROUND IT LEADS TO BUSINESS UNCERTAINTY MORE THAN THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STRIKE A DEAL BEFORE WE GET OUT IN OTHER WORDS LET'S LEAVE AND THEN WE'LL SORT OUT SOME SORT OF ARRANGEMENT ABOUT WHAT OUR TRADING TIES SHOULD BE WITH THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SO YOU WRITE THE TWO KEY THINGS I THINK HAVE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND TIMING AND WILL BE TALKING ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE WITH PHILIP IN THE FOREIGN SECRETARY JUST BEFORE EIGHT NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
# I'M NOT TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN THE HORROR OF THE BOMB ATTACK LATE ON SATURDAY NIGHT IN BAGHDAD HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY GRIEF AND BY ANGER BUT HER AS A CORRESPONDENT IN BAGHDAD AND ANGER DIRECTED MEANT A LOT OF IT AT THE PRIME MINISTER
YES YOU WERE VERY ANGRY YESTERDAY WHEN HE TRIED TO VISIT THE SCENE OF THE ONE OF THE DEADLIEST BOMBINGS IN AS MANY AS HE IS THEY CHASED HIS CONVOY WITH THIS STONES AND SLURS OR SWEAR WORDS THEY ARE HOLDING HIM RESPONSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CHIEFLY THE INTERIOR MINISTER
FOR THE DETERIORATING SECURITY SITUATIONS IN THE IRAQI CAPITA ESPECIALLY SECURITY FOR MANY IRAQIS HERE IN BAGHDAD COMES FIRST AND FOREMOST
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT HE COULD HAVE DONE AND HASN'T DONE
WELL I MEAN FOR THE BUST
FOUR TO FIVE YEARS OVER THE THE IRAQI CAPITAL OF THE IRAQI CABBIE TELL CHICK CHECKPOINTS EVERYWHERE
AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT
POLICE AND UNIFORMS AND THE MILITARY ARE THERE THE CAR BOMBS AND THE SUICIDE BOMBERS ARE STILL GETTING THROUGH THESE CHECKPOINTS SO THEY SAY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WRONG
ABOUT THE SECURITY MEASURES THAT FAILED TO PROTECT THEM IN THEIR CITY
AND MEANWHILE WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO DIED ENTIRE FAMILIES I UNDERSTAND AMONG THEM AND AND PRESUMABLY STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY CRITICALLY INJURED
YES I MEAN BECAUSE I MEAN THEY SAW SIDE BOMBING STRUCK AS A VERY BUSY
TIME AND IT IS VERY BUSY AND A RESIDENTIAL AREA IN CENTRAL BACK AT THAT IT'S CALLED CUT OTHER PEOPLE WERE JUST HAVING A MEAL CALLED TOSH ALL OVER THIS MEAL BEFORE THIS THOUGHT ANOTHER FASTING DAY OF THE HOLY MONTH OF ROMAN DONE AND THEY WERE GATHERING IN JUICE BARS AND CAFES AND RESTAURANTS AND SHOPPING CENTRES
THAT EXPLOSION WE WENT TO THE SCENE YESTERDAY AND THE EXPLOSION WAS SO BIG THAT MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T RECOGNISE THE BUILDING BECAUSE IT WAS BLACK AND AND THE THE FIRING GOLF BUT NOT JUST THE BUILDINGS ON ONE OF THE TWO SIDES OF THE ROAD BUT OTHER BUILDINGS UP TO SEVEN BUILDINGS WERE DESTROYED
BY THIS BOMBING AND PEOPLE HERE ARE VERY ANGRY BECAUSE THEY SAY THERE IS NO SYMPATHY IN THE WORLD WITH THEIR AGONY THEY SAY THAT P. AT THE WORLD STOOD MENACE OF SILENCE WITH THE VICTIMS OF THE PARIS APAX BANGLE AT THESE TURKEY
BUT HE HAD HIM BACK THAT IT'S ACCORDING TO THEM NOBODY FIELDS FOR THEM
# A QUAGMIRE IN BACK THAT THANKS VERY MUCH TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE PEOPLE MAY HAVE SPOKEN BUT THE LAWYERS ARE GOING TO BE SPEAKING FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME THEY WILL BE VERY BUSY INDEED ILLEGAL CHALLENGE IS BEING BROUGHT TO ENSURE THAT IT IS PARLIAMENT'S NOT OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER ON THEIR OWN WHO FILED FOR DIVORCE FROM THE E.U. BY SUBMITTING WHAT'S KNOWN AS ARTICLE FIFTY A LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CLIVE COLEMAN JOINS US NOW WHAT'S THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THIS CHALLENGE GUYS
OH KAY WILL MISH CONNED TO RARE THAT'S THE LAW FIRM INVOLVED THEIR CLIENTS WHO I'M TOLD ARE A SMALL BUT GROWING GROUP OF BUSINESS PEOPLE AND ACADEMICS ARGUE THAT UNDER THE U.K. CONSTITUTION THEIR DECISION TO TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY RESTS WITH PARLIAMENT NOW THIS FOLLOWS LEGAL OPINIONS IN ARTICLES THAT WERE PUBLISHED LAST WEEK BY EXPERTS INCLUDING POSSIBLY THE COUNTRY'S LEADING PUBLIC LAW BARRISTER LORD PANIC YOU SEE
AND THE ARTICLES ASSERTED OF MISH CONDOR REDS CLIENTS BELIEVED THAT ANY PRIME MINISTER USING EXECUTIVE POWERS NOW THESE ARE KNOWN AS PREROGATIVE POWERS THEY DERIVE FROM THE CROWN AND HE PROMISED TO USING THOSE TO START THE ARTICLE FIFTY PROCESS WILL BE ACTING UNLAWFULLY BECAUSE DOING SO WOULD OVERRIDE THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO EUROPEAN COMMUNITY'S ACT THAT'S THE ACT THAT ENSHRINES THE U.K. MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. AND GIVES ITS TREATIES EFFECT IN DOMESTIC LAW AND THE REASON IS THAT BY CASE LAW ON CONVENTION
ONLY LEGISLATION CAN OVERRIDE LEGISLATION IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE MINISTERS SIMPLY OVERRIDING LEGISLATION BY USING THESE PREROGATIVE EXECUTIVE POWERS AND SO AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT IS REQUIRED IT IS SAID TO GIVE THE PRIME MINISTER LEGAL AUTHORITY TO PRESS THE ARTICLE FIFTY BUTTONS
# ONE THING THAT WILL NOT BE KEEPING THEIR LAWYERS BUSY APPARENTLY WE'RE TOLD IS THE SUGGESTION THAT TONY BLAIR MAY BE SENT TO TRIAL AS A WAR CRIMINAL NOW VERY SIGNIFICANT THIS AHEAD OF THE CHILCOTT REPORT COMING OUT YOU'VE GOT ROCK INTO THE IRAQ WAR OF COURSE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS TIME WHY IS THERE NO LEGAL BASIS FOR A CHARGE A WAR CRIMINAL
SOME PEOPLE MAY BE A LITTLE SURPRISED BY THIS THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT HAS SAID THAT IT'S PROSECUTORS ARE GOING TO EXAMINE THE CHILCOTT REPORT FOR EVIDENCE OF RAW WAR CRIMES COMMITTED BY BRITISH TROOPS BUT THE DECISION TO GO TO WAR REMAINS OUTSIDE THE COURTS REMIT NOW IN A STATEMENT TO THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH IT SAID THAT AS ALREADY INDICATED BY THE OFFICE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE DECISION BY THE U.K. TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ FALLS OUTSIDE THE COURT'S JURISDICTION
AND THE ICY SEA PROSECUTORS OFFICES SAID THAT THE ICY SEA WAS LOOKING AT INTRODUCING A CRIME OF AGGRESSION WHICH WOULD COVER ILLEGAL INNOVATIONS BUT THAT HASN'T YET CRYSTALLISE AND INVENT ANY EVENT WILL NOT APPLY RETROSPECTIVELY SO THE ICY SEA CURRENTLY HAS JURISDICTION TO PROSECUTE INDIVIDUALS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMES OF GENOCIDE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND WAR CRIMES
ARTICLE EIGHT OF THE COURT STATUE DEFINES CRIMES OF AGGRESSION BUT THE COURT HE ISN'T YET ABLE TO PROSECUTE INDIVIDUALS FOR THESE CRIMES I CAN GIVE YOU IF WE HAVE TIME TO THINK OF IT LITTLE DETAIL AS TO WHY THAT IS WE HAVEN'T GOT MUCH BUT JUST BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD VERY O.K. WELL THE STATUTE THE STATUTE ORIGINALLY PROVIDED THAT THE COURT COULD NOT EXERCISE ITS JURISDICTION OVER THE CRIME OF HER AGGRESSION UNTIL THE STATES' PARTIES THE STATES SIGNED UP TO THE COURT
AGREED ON A DEFINITION OF THE CRIME AND SET OUT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT COULD BE PROSECUTED O.K. THAT'D MEN I'LL THEN THE DETAIL AT THAT POINT WE COULD SPEAK FOR HOURS WE SHOULD AND WE WILL THEN THERE WILL BE DAISY WOULD BE WILL AFTER WEDNESDAY CHILCOT IS OUT ON WEDNESDAY BUT THE HEADLINE IS THE IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS TONY BLAIR WHETHER YOU WANT HIM TO OR NOT WHETHER THERE'S EVIDENCE OR NOT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE
# TO BRING HIM BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT CLIVE COMMON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED SEVENTY MINISTERS HMM LOOK AT THE PAPERS THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND HAS WRITTEN AN ARTICLE FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IN SUPPORT OF THERESA MAY'S BID TO BECOME TORY LEADER HE SAYS SHE'LL WORK TIRELESSLY TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION TO KEEP THE COUNTRY SAFE AND TO UNITE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IF SHE BECOMES THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT RATHER THAN SQUANDERING TIME AND NEGOTIATING CAPITAL WE SHOULD RECOGNISE UPFRONT
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A TRADE OFF BETWEEN CONTROLS ON FREE MOVEMENT OF ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET ACCORDING TO THE DAILY MIRROR THE GOVERNING PARTY'S BRAWLING LIKE AN UNRULY RABBLE IN A BATTLE OF INSULTS FROM THE BATTLE OF IDEAS WHOEVER WINS THE DODGY RACE IT SAYS WILL LACK THE ONLY MANDATE WHICH COUNTS THAT OF THE COUNTRY
# OR SOME PRINTS PICTURES OF WHAT IT CALLS THE FIFTEEN MOST OUT OF TOUCH TORY M.P.S WHO THOSE WHO BACKED REMAIN BUT HAVE CONSTITUENCIES WHERE LARGE MAJORITIES VOTED LEAVE FIVE OF THEM ARE MINISTERS INCLUDING ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY LIST TRUST IN THE CABINET OFFICE MINISTER MATTHEW HANCOCK AND ACADEMIC WHO COMPILED THE FIGURES MATTHEW GOODE WENT
TELLS THE PAPER THE FIFTEEN WILL HAVE TO TREAD EXTREMELY CAREFULLY THERE TO RETAIN THE SUPPORT OF THEIR FAR MORE EURO SCEPTIC VOTERS AS AN ASIDE AN EDITORIAL IN THE TELEGRAPH POINTS OUT THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TORY LEADERSHIP RACE IN HISTORY WHICH DOESN'T INCLUDE AN ENGLISH MAN AS ALL THREE OF THE MEN IN THE CONTEST MICHAEL GAVE LIAM FOX AND STEPHEN CRAB WERE BORN IN SCOTLAND THE DAILY MIRROR LEADS ON THE HEARTBREAK OF RELATIVES OF CAROLINE AHERNE FOLLOWING HER DEATH ON SATURDAY
# PAPER SAYS THE FIFTY TWO YEAR OLD STAR DIED ALONE AT HOME HER FAMILY UNAWARE THAT HER BATTLE AGAINST LUNG CANCER HAD SUDDENLY TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE HER BROTHER PATRICK TELLS THE PAPER I'VE LOST A BEAUTIFUL SISTER IN THE WORLD HAS LOST AN AMAZING TALENT AN UNNAMED RELATIVE TELLS THE PAPER IT WAS TOO QUICK WE DIDN'T EXPECT HER TO GO SHE DIED ON HER OWN
# THE TIME NOW IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN OUR MAIN STORY THIS MORNING BORIS JOHNSON HAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF ALLOWING A KIND OF HYSTERIA TO GRIP SOME VOTERS BY FAILING TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO SHOW THE BENEFITS OF BRICKS AND AFTER A WEEK OF BRECHT'S AT MISERY DAVID CAMERON HAS RECEIVED SOME UNEXPECTED AND POSSIBLY UNWANTED SUPPORT ANDREI LUGOVOI THE FORMER RUSSIAN AGENT WANTED BY BRITAIN OVER THE KILLING OF ALEXANDER LITVINENKO HAS TOLD THE B.B.C. THAT MISTER CAMERON'S DECISION TO RESIGN SHOWED THAT HE WAS A DECENT PERSON
TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS WHEN YOU MISTER LUKE AVOIDED AT THAT HE WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE REFERENDUM RESULT IN RUSSIA SUMMER WONDERING WORK THAT POST BRECK SAID THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY MEET THE FATE OF THE SOVIET UNION AND OTHER WORDS UNRAVEL BE CONSIGNED TO HISTORY AS A MUSKET CORRESPONDENT STEVEN ROSENBERG REPORTS
THE YEAR WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
I'D TAKEN A YEAR OUT TO STUDY IN MOSCOW AND ON NOVEMBER THE SEVENTH REVOLUTION DATE I REMEMBER WATCHING THE MILITARY PARADE ON RED SQUARE
AND AS WAVES OF TANKS AND TROOPS SWEPT PAST THE SOVIET SUPERPOWER FELT A STRONG AS EVER
AND YET JUST TWO YEARS LATER THE U.S. IS SAR WAS GONE
ONE BY ONE THE FIFTEEN SOVIET REPUBLICS HAD EXITED THE UNION AND HAD DECLARED THEIR INDEPENDENCE
NOW THE SOVIET UNION WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION THE U.S.S.R. WAS AN EMPIRE THE E.U. IS NOT
BUT WITH REX IT CALLING INTO QUESTION THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT LESSONS CAN BE Y. YOU LEARN FROM WHAT HAPPENED HERE
QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO SUPER STATES IT'S ALWAYS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT BECOMES A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY IN MANY WAYS IRINA CLOCK OVER HIS EDITOR IN CHIEF OF NEW LITERARY OBSERVER
SHE BELIEVES THAT IF BRUSSELS WANTS TO SAVE THE EUROPEAN PROJECT IT SHOULD READ UP ON RUSSIAN HISTORY IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP GRADE COLLAPSES IN THE HISTORY OF RUSSIA THE COLLAPSE OF THE IMPERIAL THE CRASH AND THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION AT THE END OF THE CENTURY NEGLECTING THE NATIONAL CULTURAL DIFFERENCES CREATING THESE SEE YOU PUT A UNIFIED STRUCTURES
ALWAYS LEADS TO DISASTER AND A EUROPEAN UNIT YOU KNOW IT'S A CONICAL EMIRATES OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES DIFFERENT HISTORY IS A POLITICAL REGIMES SO PROBABLY YOU NEED MORE FLEXIBLE EDITOR YOU WANT TODD DIFFERENT BASH NOT AT TATTON
RUSSIA'S AMBASSADOR TO THE E.U. BLOODY MADE OF PAINTS A BLEAK FUTURE FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION THIS IS THE FIRST DAY
ACTUALLY THE PROCESS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION
HE'S NOT BORED DON'T FOLD OR BORES
BUT DID SEXUALLY ASTAIRE BECK ONCE BUT THIS IS LIKE
OF COURSE THEY WERE VERY VERY DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONS BUT THE U. S. S. R. AND B. E.
BUT BOTH UNIONS ARE DIFFERENT KINDS WELL YOU COULD ALSO PUT INTO THE LINED THE BRITISH EMPIRE
WOULDN'T YOU IS THERE ANYTHING ANY LESSON DO YOU THINK FOR THE E.U. TO LEARN FROM HISTORY
THERE ARE ALWAYS LESSONS FROM HISTORY
NEED TO BE LEARNED BUT SELDOM ON IT DOESN'T STRIDING SNAPPY THE RATS RUSSIAN STATE TELEVISION PREDICTS THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IT DESCRIBES THE E. USE AS A BALLOON LEAKING AIR AND DAVID CAMERON AS AN INGLORIOUS LOSER WITH BLOOD ON HIS HANDS WHO HAS SPLIT HIS COUNTRY
NO THAT'S CORAL RUSSIA IS NOT AN IMPARTIAL OBSERVER IT'S UNDER E.U. SANCTIONS AND IT FELL OUT WITH LONDON LONG AGO OVER THE ASSASSINATION IN LONDON OF THE FORMER RUSSIAN SPY ALEXANDER LITVINENKO
SHE'D LET US TO BOTH US BETTER MYSELF BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE THE OR YOU SO SHE'S NOT ANSWERS I MEET ONE OF THE TWO MET THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES BELIEVE KILLED ALEXANDER LITVINENKO
AND RE LUGOVOI THE FORMER AGENT NOW A RUSSIAN M. P. INSISTS HE'S INNOCENT AND RUSSIA REFUSES TO EXTRADITE HIM BUT HE HAD NO YOU'LL BE ALL OF THOSE IN YOUR PURSE
MISTER LUGOVOI TELLS ME HE'S PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY BRICKS IT AND CALLS ON MORE E.U. STATES TO ADOPT POSITIONS INDEPENDENT OF BRUSSELS
FROM THE FALL OF THE U.S. ASAHI SAYS THE Y. YOU SHOULD LEARN THIS LESSON YOU MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUALITY OF EACH MEMBER STATE AND THEN UNEXPECTEDLY THE PRIME SUSPECT PRAISES THE PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON WE HAD MODEL SHE SET EST MORT
I RESPECTED MY LUGOVOI TELLS ME IF HE SAYS HE'S RESIGNING THAT SHOWS HE'S A DECENT PERSON WHO TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS AT ALL NOR NEAR THAT IT SHEDS COMPLIMENTS FROM A. SUSPECTED ASSASSIN WILL COME AS LITTLE COMFORT TO MISTER CAMERON
AS FOR THE E.U. IT'S WILL NEED A PERIOD OF REFLECTION TO WORK OUT HOW TO AVOID THE SOVIET UNION'S FATE BEING CONSIGNED TO HISTORY
# STEVEN ROSENBERG REPORTING THERE THE TIME NOW IS TEN TO SEVEN
THE TRADE UNIONS ARE OFFERING TO BROKER A PEACE DEAL BETWEEN JEREMY CORBIN AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF LABOUR M.P.S IN THE SHADOW CABINET WHO SEEM INTENT ON DEPOSING HIM AS LABOUR'S LEADER THE GARDAI REPORTS THIS MORNING HE COULD BECOME IN EFFECT CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY WERE THE KITCHEN CABINET RATHER THAN WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS SUPREME LEADER OR MANUAL CORTEZ IS GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE T. E. DOUBLE S. A UNION JOINS US IN THE STUDIO HOW WOULD THIS MEDIATION THIS PEACE PROCESS WORK MY COURSE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
I MEAN I THINK THE LABOUR PARTY'S REALLY FORTUNATE THAT TRADE UNIONS AFFILIATE TO IT BECAUSE THE LEADERS OF THOSE STREET UNIONS COLLECTIVELY WE HAVE A WILL
TO TRY AND MEDIATE WE ALSO HAVE A WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE OF DOING THIS WE DO THIS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WE GO INTO CONFLICT SITUATIONS AND END UP WITH POSITIVE RESOLUTIONS SO I FULLY SUPPORT WHAT LEN PROPOSED YESTERDAY THAT TRADE UNION LEADERS LIKE MYSELF
LIKE LEN SHOULD BE GETTING INVOLVED NOW KNOCKING HEADS TOGETHER BECAUSE THE ONE THING WE REALLY NEED AT THIS POINT IS CALLED HEADS I'M FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE APPEAR TO HAVE LOST THEIRS YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR IS THERE ARE YOU IN THIS FAR FROM KNOCKING HEADS TOGETHER YOU TO NOT THE M.P.S IT HELPED YOU WROTE A LETTER
WITH LEN MCCLUSKEY SAYING THAT THIS CRISIS WAS DEEPLY REGRETTABLE AND UNNECESSARY HE'S DESCRIBED IT AS A COUP IS ALSO DESCRIBED IT AS A SINISTER PLOT I'M NOT SURE I'D BE WILLING TO GET A ROOM WITH YOU AND SHUT THE DOOR GIVES WHAT YOU SAID WELL I TELL YOU SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY NOT A CUCKOO BECAUSE TO WHO
TO HAVE A COUP AND EFFECTIVE COOL YOU NEED TO DECAPITATE THE LEADERSHIP THEY SUSSED BEEN LINGERING ON FOR A LONG TIME JEREMY IS STILL IN PLACE
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT WE'VE HAD A PETULANT RESPONSE FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER WE ARE BUT IT'S A REGRESSION GIVEN THAT YOU THINK THAT'S PURPLE ENTITLED VIEW WHY ON EARTH SHOULD THEY TAKE SERIOUSLY IDEA THAT YOU'VE GOT A COOL HEAD IN EITHER NO ARBITRARY BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOST THEIR HEADS WE HAVE SAID FROM THE START THAT WE ARE PROUD THAT THE LABOUR PARTY'S A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT IS A WAY TO CHALLENGE THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY
AND IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THAT IN TOTAL TO DO IT HAVE HAVEN'T CONTEST ABSOLUTELY IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THEY HAVE TO PUT UP OR SHUT UP BUT IF THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO PUT UP WITH THE NEED TO DO IS STOP THE PETULANCE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE VOTED FOR THE LABOUR PARTY AIN'T GONNA FORGET FOR THE TOWING
THE COUNTRY IS IN A CRISIS THE TORY PARTY IS IN A CRISIS WE NEED AN EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION YOU KNOW TODAY THE CHANCE ABOUT IN TAKES DEBBIE KNOWS THAT WE NEED AN EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION BUT IF YOU HAVE LOST MAJORITY SUPPORT OF YOUR OWN M.P.S IN YOUR SHADOW CABINET WHAT LEADER WOULD NOT CONCLUDE I CANNOT PROVIDE EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION WELL I THINK SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT JEREMY
IT'S A CONVENTIONAL LEADER AND WHAT WOULD BE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF CONVENTIONAL POLITICS BUT HE HE'S BRINGING IN A NEW KIND OF POLITICS YOU KNOW THE ONE THING THAT MANY LABOURERS M.P.S CANNOT FAR THEM IS THE FACT THAT HE'S OFF THE MEMBERSHIP AND FOR THE MEMBERSHIP IS NOT THERE FOR THEIR CONVENIENCE
THE REALITY IS THAT WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND MOVE FORWARD FROM IMPRESS UP WE'VE GOT LOOK TODAY GEORGE OSBORNE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S GOING TO
BUSINESS TAXES THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE LESS MONEY FOR SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS THE LABOUR PARTY NEAT TO BE OUT THERE FIGHTING
WHAT THE TORIES ARE DOING HE'S NOT A CONVENTIONAL LEADER IN THIS SENSE BRIEFLY HE'S ME WHICH IS HE'S NO INTERESTING ACTUALLY WINNING AN ELECTION AS FAR AS WE CAN I THINK IT'S GOT EVERY INTEREST IN WINNING AN ELECTION ACTUALLY THE RESULTS OF THE HYMN HAVE BEEN REMARKABLY GOOD LOOK AT THE BY ELECTIONS SO IS THAT IT LOOK LOOK LOOK WHAT WE'VE DONE IN LONDON AND LOOK WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TO THE END OF THE MEDIATION IS HE STAYS
# I DON'T WANT TO PRE WHAT MY HAPPEN THAT PROCESS BUT WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER WE NEED COOL HEADS THAT YOU CAUGHT IT TAKE THE T. S. T. DOUBLE I SAY THANK YOU FOR JOINING THE TIME SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN A GOVERNMENT REVIEW HAS SUGGESTED THAT WHITEHALL HAS TWENTY ACTIVE HANDS ON TRADE NEGOTIATORS
THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED WORKING FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION SO JOB NUMBER ONE FOR THE NEW PRIME MINISTER MAY WELL BE TO APPOINT SOME TRADE NEGOTIATORS AND DO SO PRETTY SHARPISH BECAUSE BRUSSELS HAS BEEN DOING THE JOB FOR US SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE WE HAVE A BIT OF CATCHING UP TO DO MICHAEL JOHNSON IS A FORMER TRADE NEGOTIATOR FOR THE U.K. GOVERNMENT TO SAY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THAT WHAT DO YOU THAT THE FIRST JOB IS IS TO GET A LOT OF PEOPLE A POINT WELL VERY MUCH SO BECAUSE I WAS THINKING BACK WHEN I WAS ASKED TO COME AND DO THIS INTERVIEW
TO THE PERIOD IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WHEN WE WERE NEGOTIATING WITH THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT LED TO THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION IN ITS PRESENT FORM AND AT THAT TIME I RECKON THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY HAD A
A WHOLE DIVISION OF SIXTY OR SO PEOPLE WORKING ON TRADE POLICY AND ROUND WHITEHALL IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS WAS TRADED INTERESTS THERE WORTH ANOTHER FORTY OR FIFTY SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING NORTH OF ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE WITH REAL EXPERTISE IN TRADE ANALYSIS A NEGOTIATION IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW BIG IS THE JOB
IT'S AN ENORMOUS JOB BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE NITTY GRITTY DETAIL ALL THE TIME IN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS THAT ANYBODY CAN GO INTO A ROOM AND MAKE RIGHT GREAT STATEMENTS OR AGREE GREAT PRINCIPLES BUT HE COMES TO THE TARIFF RATES ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS PARTICULARLY TO TERRIF RATES ON CARS THERE AND OTHER SENSITIVE PRODUCTS LIKE TEXTILES FOR EXAMPLE AND ELECTRONICS
THERE HAS TO BE DETAILED AND ONGOING CONSULTATION WITH THE INTERESTED INDUSTRIAL MICE ONE OPTION B. THOSE SIMPLY TO SAY WE WILL GO TO A KIND OF BASIC WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION A PROVED BASIC RATE OF TARIFFS AROUND THE WORSE WE WON'T HAVE TO DO INDIVIDUAL NEGOTIATIONS WHILE WE WORK OUT WHAT TO DO IN THE LONG ABOUT FUTURE WE COULD DO THAT BECAUSE
ONE THING THAT IMMEDIATELY WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN AFTER BRICKS IT WOULD BE THAT THE U.K. WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT LEVEL OF EXTERNAL TERRACE IT WAS GOING TO APPLY BECAUSE WE CAN'T ME APPLY THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF OF THE OF THE E.U.
AND WE COULD STICK TO THAT WE WE COULD AND INDEED I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY VIABLE OPTION BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HAVE TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELY AND CONSULT ON TARIFF RATES FOR ANYTHING IN EXCESS WOULD WE HAVE THIS FREEDOM THEN TO STICK TO THAT BUT FOR CERTAIN THINGS AND I'M THINKING THINK YOU PARTICULARLY STEEL ACTUALLY GIVEN WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING RECENTLY BUT WHETHER ACTUALLY AND IN CERTAIN CASES WE COULD SAY NO WE'RE GOING TO SLAP A BIG TIME YES YOU COULD AND IN AS FAR AS
AT THE TERRACE THAT WE SNAPPED ON WAS GREATER THAN THE RATE WE CURRENTLY APPLY UNDER THE COMMON CUSTOMS TERRIF OTHER INTERESTED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION WOULD HAVE RIGHTS TO DEMAND NEGOTIATION FOR COMPENSATION FOR EQUIVALENT
REDUCTIONS OF SIMILAR VALUE HIM OUT OTHER AREAS OF INTEREST TO THEM SO THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE A VERY COMPLEX NEGOTIATION SET OFF IN GENEVA IN THERE WHICH COULD MOUSE WHICH COULD LAST A VERY LONG SO YOU COULDN'T JUST SLAP IT ON AND THE OTHER IDEA JUST VIBRATE IN TWENTY SECONDS OR SO THAT'S THAT SOME PEOPLE JUST GET RID OF TERROR JUST SAY WE ARE OPEN FOR TRADE WITH EVERYONE WELL RING IT OFF IT MINFORD HAS SUGGESTED THAT AND OF COURSE THERE IS A GOOD ORTHODOXY COMIC CASE FOR SAYING THAT OR TRAY PROTECTION IS BED
# YOU JUST TRY TELLING THAT TO ALL THE INTERESTED SECTORS AND PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOOK FOR SPECIAL PROTECTION AS SOON AS YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE BAD I THINK IT'S VERY UNLIKELY MICHAEL JOHNSON FORMER TRADE NEGOTIATOR FOR THE U.K. GOVERNMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN BEN RICH IS HERE WITH OTHER MORNING BUT HOW THE NEXT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SOUTHERN AND EASTERN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY CAN EXPECTS A LOT OF DRY WEATHER THROUGH THE WEEK AHEAD BUT FURTHER NORTH AND WEST YES THEY'LL BE DRY SPELLS

SINCE PITT THE YOUNGER HAVING BEEN AN M.P. FOR JUST SIX YEARS AND A JUNIOR MINISTER FOR CHEST TO HER CAMPAIGN LAUNCHES FORMALLY TODAY SHE'LL BE BACKED BY THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. ANN MARIE MORRIS WHO'S IN THE STUDIO WITH US GOOD MORNING TO YOU AT A TIME OF ECONOMIC RISK AND UNCERTAINTY A TIME OF NATIONAL DIVISION A TIME OF INTERNATIONAL FEARS AND WRISTS AS WELL WHY ON EARTH IS IT TIME FOR A NOVICE TO BE MOVING INTO NUMBER TEN
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANDREW IS OR NOT IS AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING SOME REAL LIFE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE ANDREA HAS SPENT TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THE CITY SHE IS NO NOVICE SHE'S A HARD LADY SHE WILL ABSOLUTELY DRIVE THE COUNTRY FORWARD AND SHE HAS A VISION IN THE WAY THAT A COMPETITOR FRANKLY DOES NOT SHE SAYS I'M JUST HOLDING THE FORT AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOR A PRIME MINISTER JUST BE GREY OR TALK ABOUT THERESA MAY I AM INDEED I AM LET'S JUST DO WHAT DEAL WITH VEG TO FACTORIES NOT A NOVICE SHE HAS NEVER SAT IN A CABINET MEETING
I DON'T THINK HE'S NEVER HAD A NATIONAL SECURITY BRIEFING I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE SAT IN THE CABINET WE ALL HAD A NATIONAL SECURITY BRIEFING TO BE SOMEBODY WHO WAS EXTREMELY WELL PLACED TO NEGOTIATE THE BRETT'S EGGS IF YOU THINK ABOUT TERESA HAS VERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE THERE SHE NOT OF HOW TO NEGOTIATE IN TERMS OF BUT SHE DOES NOT HAVE ANDREW'S EXPERIENCE IN EUROPEAN ISSUE AND THIS WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF GOING TO HOSPITAL AND SOMEONE SAYING DON'T WORRY I KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT TO SAW OFF ONE OF YOUR LEGS WILL GET ONE OF THE MEDICAL STUDENTS IN
I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU I THINK YOU'RE COMPLETELY UNDERESTIMATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE ANDREA HAS ANY SPARE SHE HAS THAT NEGOTIATING IN THE REAL WORLD THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT HOW DOES BIG INVESTMENT BANKER FOR A DECADE QUALIFY YOU TO NEGOTIATE WITH WORLD LEADERS SOMETHING YOU'VE NO EXPERIENCE OF DOING BECAUSE WELSH IT WAS AN INVESTMENT BANKER SHE GOT INVOLVED IN MANY OF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE RECENT DOWNTURN OUT OR NOT SO RECENT DOWNTURN AND PLAYED A CRUCIAL PART IN HELPING THE BANKS AND ECONOMY THROUGH IT NOW YOU SAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A VISION WOULD IT BE RIGHT
FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO ELECT SOMEONE AFTER THIS BRECHT'S IT VOTE WHO SAID THE BRICKS IT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR OUR ECONOMY AND LEAD TO A DECADE OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY WOULD THAT BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT COMMENT HAS BEEN TAKEN WELL AT A CONCERT CONTEXT ANDREW PUTTING FORWARD
THE FRESH START OF USE WE WERE JUST IN CLARA'S ANDREA LEADS AND WHO PREDICTED THE BRICKS IT WOULD BE A QUOTES DISASTER FOR OUR ECONOMY LEADING TO A DECADE OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY I THINK IT WILL BE FAIR TO PUT HER IN CONTACT NICK WHAT SHE SAID WAS THERE A NUMBER OF REFORMS THAT NEED TO BE MET BUT IF THEY CAN BE MADE THEN GO FORWARD WE HAVE SEEN FROM WHAT DAVID TRY THAT IT SIMPLY CAN'T BE DONE FORGIVE ME THAT DOESN'T ALTER THE PREDICTION YOU MAY THINK THAT BEING IN EUROPE WOULD BE BETTER IF IT'S REFORMED BUT IF YOU USE THE WORDS WHICH LATER WERE CHARACTERISED AS PROJECT FEE
PRESUMABLY SHE MEANT AT THE TIME SHE SAID THEM THAT WAS HER PREDICTION ABOUT WHAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD MEAN SHE DIDN'T MEAN AND SHE DIDN'T SAY IN THAT SPEECH THREE YEARS AGO IF WE DON'T DO THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER IT WON'T BE A DISASTER SHE SAID IT WOULD BE A DISASTER
NICK I THINK WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH PREDICTIONS OVER THE LAST ELECTION WHICH WOULD WRONG OVER THE EURO AND THAT'LL BE GOOD I'M NOT SURE THAT WE CAN REALLY BUT IT'S A FUTURE LEADER AND WHETHER SHOULD BE GOOD OR BAD ON PREDICTION WELL SHE IS AN EXPERIENCE AND SHE SAID SOMETHING THREE YEARS AGO SHE NO LONGER BELIEVES NOW DOES SHE ALSO THINK ARE GETTING BACKING FROM THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY'S PRINCIPLE OPPONENTS IN UKIP IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT
MAKE NO MISTAKE ANDREA IS OR NO ONE'S POCKET REMEMBER VOTE LEAVE WAS VERY MUCH A CROSS PARTY INITIATIVE SHE'S GOT THE BACK IF YOU GETS MAIMED OWNER ARRAN BANKS THE BACKING OF PEOPLE LIKE HIS CELLAR STEWART DO YOU NOT THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO BE A PRIME MINISTER WHO COULDN'T YOU CAN GAIN THEIR SUPPORT ACROSS ALL THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM BUT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO TORY M.P.S ARE MEMBERS WE CAN END THIS DIVISION WITH UKIP IF YOU HAVE ANDREW SHE'LL BRING THEM ALL BACK IN
I THINK MY MESSAGE TO THE MEMBERS IT IS LOOK AT SOMEBODY WHO CAN NOT ONLY GIVE YOU GREAT OUR POSITION ON THE GO JETTING BACK BUT SOMEBODY WHO ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKE US FURTHER FORWARDS AND ISN'T GOING TO BE STEADY STATE SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY IS GOING TO GIVE US AN ELECTION WIN AND THAT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS WINNING THE BRECHT WENT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A MEMBERSHIP VOTE WHY DID YOU SAY ON THE SOFA YESTERDAY MORNING THAT SHE WOULD PUBLISH A TAX RETURN ONLY TO SAY BY THE EVENING THAT SHE WOULDN'T IN FACT DO IT UNLESS SHE ENDED UP IN THE LAST TWO FOR THE LEADERSHIP
MY UNDERSTANDING NICKI'S AT BUT THE PROPOSITION WHICH THE B. B. C. IS BUT ALL OF THE CANDIDATE IS WILL YOU WILL YOU PUBLISH IT TODAY BEFORE SHE SAID SHE'S ISSUE IF YOU'RE WELL IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS SHE SAYS SHE'S ONLY REPEATING THE CONDITIONS THAT HE WAS THE B. B. C. AS RABBITS ATE NO FORGIVE ME THAT'S NOT WHAT ANDREW MARR ASKED HE SIMPLY ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS IN HER PUBLISHER TAX RETURN AND SHE SAID YES
BUT NOW SHE SAYS YES MAYBE PERHAPS IF I GET TO THE ROSTER I LISTEN TO THAT NOT A SHELL AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT SHE WOULD PUBLISH IN A COURT WITH ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATE VERY VERY BRIEFLY EMERY IS IT SIGNIFICANT HAVE ASKED WHO MIGHT WELL BE WOMEN IS THAT TELLING US SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT POLITICS NEEDS
I THINK IT SAYS THAT WE CUT TO A POINT WHERE WE'RE NOT VERY MUCH A TILE WITH MEN WE CERTAINLY DON'T NEED ANY SPECIAL FAVOURS WE'RE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF FIGHTING A COLLAR AROUND FOR THE COUNTRY AND MAURICE THANK YOU JOHN
# THE TIME FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ANOTHER STEP TODAY IN THE DELAYED AT HINKLEY POINT NUCLEAR POWER STATION PROJECT NOT A FIND YES ES A FINAL NO BUT DOMINIKA CONNELL IS HERE WITH NONETHELESS AN IMPORTANT STEP HERE BECAUSE IT IS AFTER THE BRICKS ABOUT THE BRITISH AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS BOTH REPEAT BE A SUPPORT FOR THE LONG DELAYED HINKLEY POINT C. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN SOMERSET WHICH IS DUE TO BE BUILT AND PART FINANCED BY THE MAINLY STATE OWNED FRENCH POWER COMPANY
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE DELAYS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE STAGE THE BOSS OF E.D.F. SAID THAT MIXTURE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE'D ALL BE EATING CHRISTMAS DINNERS THAT WERE COOKED PARTLY ON POWER FROM THE STATION BUT WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT FINAL GO AHEAD
A CONSULTATION PROCESS BETWEEN E.D.F. AND THE FRENCH UNIONS ENDS ONE OF THOSE WHO SIGNED THE RIVER FROM THE U.K. UNION SUPPORTER THE PROJECTS THIS JUSTIN BOWDEN THE G.N.P. NATIONAL SECRETARY HE'S IN OUR STUDIO AND TUNBRIDGE WELLS JUSTIN DO YOU EXPECT YOUR FRENCH COUNTERPARTS TO BE A SUPPORTER OF ENERGY YOU HAVE BEEN
WELCOME MORNING OF THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT WHATEVER THE DECISION THAT'S MADE TODAY IN FRANCE AT THE FRENCH CENTRAL WORKS COUNCIL IT'S ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT HINKLEY POINT IS BUILT IT'S ACTUALLY VITAL FOR THE ENERGY NEEDS OF THIS COUNTRY AND FOR OUR FUTURE
IN TERMS OF LITERALLY KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON BUT WHY IS A VITAL COS I THINK THE FRENCH UNION SAY THAT IT'S IT'S NOT VITAL IT'S ABSOLUTELY DANGEROUS MIGHT BANKRUPT THE COMPANY
WELL IT'S ABSOLUTELY VITAL FOR THE U.K.'S ENERGY NEEDS THAT'S THE CONTEXT IN WHICH I I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN THIS TO THAT WE NEED THIS ENERGY AS PART OF OUR ENERGY SUPPLY CHAIN GOING FORWARD AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT ENERGY THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION DEVELOPING VERY QUICKLY IN THE U.K. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE RECENT UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AMONGST
THE FRENCH TRADE UNIONS FOR THE PROJECT AND THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT THEIR REASONS FOR THAT BUT FROM A U.K. PERSPECTIVE FROM A U.K. GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE IT IS VITAL THAT HINKLEY POINT IS GIVEN THE GO AHEAD AND THAT BUILDING COMMENCES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OTHER OTHER PROJECTS THAT CAN PROVIDE US WITH THE POWER THAT YOU COULD SUPPORT WHY SUPPORT THIS THIS THIS WHAT THE FRENCH THINK AS A COMPLETE DUD
WILL HINKLEY POINT HIS SCHEDULE TO PRODUCE AROUND ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT OF U.K. ELECTRICITY NEEDS GOING FORWARDS THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A HUGE RELIABILITY WE DO HAVE OTHER
FORMS OF ENERGY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY RELIABLE RENEWABLES LIKE WIND FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T BE COUNTED UPON AND IN FACT IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS WE HAD FORTY SIX DAYS WHEN THERE WASN'T SUFFICIENT WIND BLOWING IN ORDER TO MEET OUR ENERGY NEEDS SO WE NEED CLEAN AND RELIABLE ENERGY OR NUCLEAR IS AN ABSOLUTELY VITAL PART OF THAT STRUCTURE ON A DIFFERENT SUBJECT JUST UM OLIVE GOT YOU ON ARE YOU HAPPY WITH JEREMY CORBIN'S REFUSAL TO RESIGN AS LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE INDUSTRIAL POLICY
AND NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF JEREMY THE POSITION FROM THE G.N.P. HAS BEEN TO CALL FOR UNITY WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY AND FOR EVERYBODY TO PULL TOGETHER AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS PERIOD OF GREAT POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HOLD TOGETHER AND AND DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUSTIN BOWDEN G.N.P. NATIONAL SECRETARY
# THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED DOMINIC IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE YACHTS ARE BEING SQUEEZED OFF THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM BY FOCUS ON CORE SUBJECTS THAT IS THE CLAIM OF THE BACK FOR THE FUTURE CAMPAIGN WHICH WANTS THE EASY BACK ALL THE ENGLISH BACCALAUREATE AND YOU MEASURE OF SCHOOL PERFORMANCE TO INCLUDE ARTS SUBJECTS AT THE MOMENT IT INCLUDES ENGLISH MATHS HISTORY OR GEOGRAPHY THE SCIENCES AND HER LANGUAGE
JORDAN BY HENRY VAN FROM THE INCORPORATED SOCIETY OF MUSICIANS WHICH IS COORDINATING THIS CAMPAIGN MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE THAT THE ARTS ARE BEING SQUEEZED OFF THE CURRICULUM WE HEARD FIGURES ACTUALLY THE BEGINNING OF JUNE PUBLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION WHICH SHOWED THAT ART AND DESIGN HAS GONE DOWN FIVE PER CENT FOR ENTRIES THIS YEAR DRAMA FOUR PER CENT DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY TEN PER CENT MUSIC THREE PERCENT I MEAN AS I'VE SEEN NO DOUBT THAT THE ENGLISH BACCALAUREATE IS HITTING
ART SUBJECT IN SCHOOLS NOW YOU SAY NO DOUBT AT ALL BUT IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS THE FIGURES HAVE ACTUALLY GONE UP AND THEY WERE THIS NOT JUST BE THE SORT OF USUAL FLUCTUATIONS A PUPIL'S INTEREST IN SUBJECT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED LAST NOVEMBER THEY CONSULTATION WAS A KIND OF SOUPED UP THE TABLE IT'S MORE THAN JUST A SIMPLE PERFORMANCE META IT'S ACTUALLY SAYING THIS IS A HEADLINE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE FOR SCHOOLS SO ACTUALLY THE CHANGE IN THE DROP HAS BEEN SINCE THEY ANNOUNCED HIS NEW Y. BACK THIS FAR MORE SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY WANT NINETY PER CENT OF PEOPLES TO BE TAKING IT
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVELY COMPULSORY IN SCHOOLS AND SIR HEAD TEACHERS UNDERSTANDABLY HEAD TEACHERS ARE BASICALLY LIMITING OPTIONS FOR PEOPLES IN SCHOOLS AND SEEING THAT RIGHT NOW IS THERE A DANGER THOUGH WITH THIS CAMPAIGN HE HAD EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THOSE OF YOU WHO LOVE THE ARTS WANT WHAT DO YOU MAKE IT A SORT OF CHORE YOU MAKE IT A QUALIFICATION YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU MAKE IT SOMETHING A SCHOOL PUTS IN A LEAGUE TABLE RATHER THAN SOMETHING OF JOY AND CREATIVITY I MEAN I THINK
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES BEING WORTH EIGHTY BILLION A YEAR TO THE U.K. ECONOMY COMPARABLE TO A FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY COMPARABLE TO A CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY THEN THESE ARE SERIOUS QUALIFICATIONS THE THING THAT NEEDS TO BE IN THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM WE'RE NOT NECESSARY ASKING FOR THE ARTS TO BE ADDED AS A BOLT ON TO THE BACK SO MUCH AS IF THE BACK IS PULLED BACK AND THE GOVERNMENT COMMITS TO WATTS
NAME'S PROGRESS ATUM ATTAINMENT EIGHT IT'S AN EIGHT SUBJECT SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE IT ALLOWS THOSE RIGOUROUS ARTS SUBJECT'S MUSIC DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY DRAMA ART TO DESIGN TO COUNT ALONGSIDE SCIENCES WHICH ARE ALSO CRITICAL ENGLISH AND MATHS AND ALL THOSE OTHERS IN EFFECT YOU'RE SAYING MEASURE THE MOMENT OF A SCHOOL IN A IN A DIFFERENT WAY IN A WAY THAT INCORPORATES EXACTLY A BROADER BALANCE CORRECTLY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING I KNOW VERY CAREFULLY THAT YOU VERY CAREFULLY USE THE WORD RIGOUROUS SUBJECTS THERE WILL BE PEOPLE LISTENING
NOT YET MORE PRESSURE FOR A SOFT EASY LIE BACK AND ENJOY YOURSELF SUBJECTS TO BE ON THE CREW AND I THINK THE GOVERNMENT INTEREST LAY IN THEIR OWN CONSULTATION DOCUMENT MENTION THE PROFESSOR ALISON WALLS REVIEW OF QUALIFICATIONS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY SCRAPPED A WHOLE LOAD OF QUALIFICATIONS WHICH THEY DEEMED TO BE NOT WORTHY BUT THEY DIDN'T SCOUT THESE QUALIFICATIONS THESE QUALIFICATIONS ARE DIFFICULT THEY ARE CHALLENGING THEIR ACADEMIC AND INTELLECTUAL HENRY VAN FROM THE INCORPORATED SOCIETY MUSICIANS THANK YOU THANK YOU
# TIME TWENTY PAST SEVEN ONE IN FIVE OF ALL RAIL PASSENGERS AND ENGLAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY TRAVEL ON GO VIA THAMES LINK SERVICES THESE THAT THE SERVICES INTO LONDON MOST OF THEM FROM SUSSEX UNDER THE BROWNED SOUTHERN RIGHT DOWN TO BRIGHTON AND THEY'RE QUITE A MESS THERE'S ENGINEERING WORK AND THERE ARE DISPUTES WITH THE UNION ABOUT WHO CHECKS THE DOOR WHEN A TRAIN'S READY TO LEAVE AND NOW WE HEAR THERE IS TO BE AN EMERGENCY TIMETABLE FROM NEXT WEEK
HUNDREDS OF TRAINS CANCELLED OR SHOULD I SAY HUNDREDS MORE TRAINS CANCELLED STOPPED BRIEFLY TO RICHARD WESTCOTT OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT THIS IS A FIRM PLAN IS IT RICHARD THAT THE TIMETABLE THAT A SPECIAL TIMETABLE WITH FEWER TRAINS IS COMING IN NEXT WEEK
WE WERE NOW TIMETABLES COMING IN THEY'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE IT OFFICIALLY TOMORROW BECAUSE THE COMPANY GOES BEFORE THE TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE BUT THE UNIONS ARE SLURRING THEY'VE BEEN TO A MEETING AND NOW THEY'VE PUT A NUMBER ON IT UNCONFIRMED BY THE COMPANIES HAVE A SAYING THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CANCELLATIONS ARE DAY AND WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING THEY HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH DRIVERS AND THEN GONE OFF CONDUCTORS THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE TAKING DAYS OFF SICK AND SAID THIS IS THE WAY THEY CAN ACTUALLY
GIVE A BETTER SERVICE AND I DO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SOUNDS LIKE A HUGE NUMBER BUT AS PEOPLE WHO GET THAT LINE WILL KNOW FOR MONTHS THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THAT KIND OF THAT LEVEL OF CANCELLATIONS EVERY DAY ANYWAY I MEAN THAT'S KIND OF LIKE A NORMAL DAY AND IT IS UP TO THEM THEY CAN JUST DO IT
BASICALLY IF THERE IS NO CHOICE THEY CAN GO TO THE GOVERNMENT AND SAY LOOK WE NEED TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN THEY CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER SERVICE FOR THE CUSTOMERS SO IT IS A LAST RESORT OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD ON THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO LOSE INCOME FOR TICKETS BUT STARTERS BUT IT YES THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO IT IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCE O.K. RICHARD WESKIT THANKS LET'S TURN TO CAROLINE LUCAS WHO'S THE GREEN PARTY M.P. FOR BRIGHTON PAVILION IS ON THE LINE FROM BRIGHTON MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHO'S TO BLAME
I DON'T THINK PASSENGERS CARE WHO'S TO BLAME THEY JUST WANT A DECENT SERVICE AND HANG ON I SAID JUST THAT THEY DO CARE SURELY IN AS MUCH AS THEY WANT TO KNOW WHO SHOULD BE SORTING IT OUT WELL I I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK THAT THE RAIL COMPANY IS TO BLAME AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENT FOR TRANSPORT OUGHT TO BE GETTING THEM AROUND A TABLE WITH THE UNION BANGING HEADS TOGETHER NOT SIMPLY ROLLING OVER AND LETTING YET MORE CANCELLATIONS HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE LATEST EMERGENCY TIMETABLE WHICH TO BE FAIR AT LEAST WILL GIVE PASSENGERS SOME
CERTAINTY OVER WHICH TRAINS GOING TO BE CANCELLED OR NOT BUT THIS IS A SERVICE WHICH THEY'RE PAYING THROUGH THE NOSE FOR THERE BEING THREATENED WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GUARANTEE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ARRIVE AT WORK ON TIME SO IT'S AN APPALLING SERVICE BUT WE'VE ALSO HAD THIS GOING ON FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS WE HEARD BACK IN FEBRUARY
THE NUMBER OF CANCELLATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ALLOWED BEFORE THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WOULD BE BREACHED WAS ALREADY GOING UP FROM TWENTY THREE THOUSAND TO THIRTY TWO THOUSAND THAT BIT OF INFORMATION WAS SLIPPED OUT THREE MONTHS LATER ON THE EVE OF A RECESS SO THE M.P.S COULDN'T EVEN CHALLENGED THE COMPANY OVER THAT THIS COMPANY IS INCOMPETENT
THEY SHOULD BE STRIPPED OF THEIR FRANCHISE IT SHOULD GO BACK IN PUBLIC HANDS BECAUSE AT THE VERY LEAST THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE ALL OF THE DETAILS IT WILL BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IT WILL BE TRANSPARENT RATHER THAN REDACTED AND SECRETIVE AS IT IS NOW THE COMPANY SAYS THERE ISN'T THERE FACING ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIAL ACTION WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE CALLING IN SICK AND THAT THE CHANGES THEY WANT TO MAKE TO HAVING DRIVER OPERATED TRAINS ARE PERFECTLY SAFE AND REASONABLE AND MANY TRAINS RUN LIKE THAT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS IT IS
WELL WE CAN GET INTO THERE THE INS AND OUTS OF THAT PARTICULAR DISPUTE AND IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO THE UNIONS THEY WERE TELL YOU THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS TO BASICALLY STRIPPED THE ROLE OF THE GUARDS OF ALL OF THEIR SAFETY FUNCTIONS IF YOU BECOME AN ONBOARD SUPERVISOR RATHER THAN A GUARD TO THAT MEANS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME QUALIFICATIONS IF IT OF A TRAIN HAS DERAILED IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THAT NOW I'M NOT SORT OF TALK ABOUT THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF THAT BUT WHAT I AM SO WHAT IS IT THIS IS JUST THE LATEST BECAUSE
BEFORE THAT YOU ALSO HAD THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT RECRUITING ENOUGH DRIVERS WE'VE HEARD STORIES ABOUT THE FACT THAT DRIVERS WHO TOOK STRIKE ACTION WITH THEM BEING PREVENTED FROM DOING OVERTIME BECAUSE THIS PARTICULAR FRANCHISE DEPEND SO MUCH ON PEOPLE BEING PREPARED TO DO OVERTIME IF THEY ARE THEN PREVENTED FROM DOING OVERTIME AS A KIND OF A PUNITIVE MEASURE THEN ITS PASSENGERS AGAIN AND AGAIN WERE THE ONES
I TAKE THE POINT ABOUT THE COMPANY BUT IT IS A FACT ISN'T IT THERE ISN'T ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT BACKS THE UNIONS POINT THAT ALL THE UNIONS CLAYTON TRAINS WITH GUARDS ARE SAFER THAN TRAINS WITHOUT HIM
WE CAN ALSO THAT UNTIL A DISASTER HAPPENS WHEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES THE RAIL SAFETY STANDARDS BUT WHICH IS THE INDEPENDENT BORDERS LOOKED AT THIS HASN'T WAS ASKED TO LOOK AT IT BY THE B. B. C. AND THEY'VE SAID ABSOLUTELY PLAINLY THAT THERE IS NO INCREASED RISK FROM ATTACK A TRAIN BEING DESPATCHED WITHOUT A GUARD IN THAT THAT IS JUST WHAT THEY SAY AND THEY'VE LOOKED AT THE FACTS OF THIS AND THEY LOOK AT THE FACT
PLENTY OF TRAINS RUN LIKE THAT AS IT IS SO THAT I DON'T CLAIM FROM THE UNION JUST ISN'T SUBSTANTIATED IS IT I'M NOT HERE TO THAT DEFEND ONE LINE OR ANOTHER ON THIS AND I DO THINK IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING THE TRAINS PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE THESE QUALIFY PEOPLE ARE WARNING US ABOUT DANGERS AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE TAKING THAT SERIOUSLY BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS LATEST
THE BARKER OVER THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY HAS BEEN UNABLE TO RESOLVE THIS DISPUTE IS JUST THE LATEST IN A WHOLE SERIES OF THE BARK HAS THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER A YEAR OVER A YEAR AGO THE REAL MINISTER TOLD US THAT THIS LINE WAS FLASHING RED IN HER DEPARTMENT THIS WAS REALLY SERIOUS
# MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS GO BY AND A SORT OF THINGS GETTING BETTER THEY'RE GETTING VERY MUCH WORSE AND WE HAVE I SHOULD SAY I ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE MINISTER TO CLAIRE PERRY BUT SHOULD SHE HASN'T CHOSEN TO COME ON SO FAR CAN I ASK YOU TO FIND OUT THE WIDER QUESTION YOU'VE WRITTEN A LETTER TO JEREMY KORBEN DATON FOUND THE LIB DEMS TO LEARN WOULD PLY CAMERA ON BEHALF OF YOUR PARTY SAYING COME ON LET'S GET TOGETHER LET'S BE A PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE AT HAVE YOU HAD A REPLY FROM JEREMY CORBIN WHAT ARE YOU HOPING TO ACHIEVE
WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVE IS A WAY OF BREAKING A LOG JAM IN THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM WHEREBY AT THE MOMENT SO MANY PEOPLE FEEL UNHEARD THEY FEEL AND LISTENED TO AND ONE OF THE ANALYSES IF YOU LIKE OF THE
OF THE REFERENDUM RESULT WAS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE VOTING LEAVE BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT THEIR CONCERNS JUST HAVEN'T BEEN HEARD FOR FOR YEARS AND THAT'S NOT LEAST BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ELECTORAL SYSTEM ONLY CARES ABOUT THE MARGINAL VOTERS IN SWING SWING VOTERS IN MARGINAL CONSTITUENCIES WE WANNA CHANGE TO THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM NOT JUST FOR SPECIAL PLEADING THAT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS THAT PEOPLE GET LISTEN TO THAT WOULD BE AN ALLIANCE AMONG THOSE PARTIES WHERE YOU WOULDN'T STAND AGAINST EACH OTHER AT THE NEXT ELECTION EVEN IF HE CAME VERY QUICKLY
I WOULD LOVE TO EXPLORE EXACTLY THAT AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR THE SAME THING TO HAPPEN IF THIS PARTICULAR ELECTORAL SYSTEM IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR PARTIES THAT SHARE MANY CONCERNS SO MANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US BUT WE DO HAVE SOME COMMON VIEWS NOT LEAST ABOUT THE THE Y. YOU WHY DON'T WE ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEATING THE TOURISM AND HAVING A MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT FOR THIS COUNTRY THERE IS A MAJORITY I BELIEVE FOR THAT IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM

REPORTED ON THE INTELLIGENCE ABOUT W.M.D. FOR THIS PROGRAMME HE NOW LOOKS AT WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHY IT MATTERS NOW
I THINK I'M AN DANGERS YOU THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER YEAH FROM THE SKY A HOTEL ROOM IN AMMAN JORDAN IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND THREE
YEAH IN FRONT OF ME IS A MAN WHO SAID HE WAS A MAJOR IN SADDAM HUSSEIN'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICE BEFORE HE DEFECTED FROM OCTOBER SO WHEN HER MUM BYE
AFTER TALKING FOR HOURS AND SMOKING ENDLESS CIGARETTES THE MAJOR BRINGS UP THE MOST TOPICAL ISSUE IRAQ'S WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION HAVEN'T YOU MY LOVE ARTIST THIS IS WHERE
THEIR IDEA OF MY MOMENT LABORATORIES BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS EYES WHEN HE BROUGHT UP MOBILE BIOLOGICAL LABS WHICH MADE ME WARY THAT IN THE KNOWLEDGE HE WAS LINKED TO AN IRAQI OPPOSITION GROUP COMMITTED TO REGIME CHANGE
AND WHILST I LOOKED FOR MORE EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE WHAT HE SAID HIS CLAIMS WERE MADE PUBLIC IN THE MOST DRAMATIC FASHION LET ME TAKE YOU INSIDE
THAT INTELLIGENCE FILE AND SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE KNOW IN EARLY FEBRUARY THEN U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL ADDRESS THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL AND LAID OUT THE EVIDENCE FOR IRAQ'S WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
FOURTH SOURCE AN IRAQI MAJOR
WHO DEFECTED CONFIRMED RHETTA RACK HAS MOBILE BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH LIBRARIES
IN ADDITION I WAS WATCHING THAT IN THE U.N. BUILDING IN BAGHDAD THERE WAS A GROUP OF US ABOUT A DOZEN INSPECTORS AND WE ALL GATHERED ALL HE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BASICALLY LAUGHED STEVE ALLENTON WAS WORKING AS A U.N. INSPECTOR IN IRAQ SEARCHING FOR THEIR WEAPONS COLIN POWELL WAS TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER SITE THE INTELLIGENCE SAID THAT THERE WERE REFRIGERATED TRUCKS INTERPRET THAT AS A MOBILE BIOLOGICAL FACILITIES
SO WENT TO A SITE AND WE FOUND ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THEM AND WE LOOKED INSIDE AND THEY WERE SO OLD AND THERE WERE COBWEBS ALL INSIDE WE STILL TOOK THE SAMPLES AND THE RESULTS OF THE SAMPLES WERE NEGATIVE THAT WHEN THEY WERE JUST REFRIGERATED TRUCKS THE MAJOR I'VE MET IN AMMAN AND WHOM SIGHTED WAS IT LATER EMERGED A FABRICATOR
ANOTHER SOURCE CODENAMED CURVEBALL WAS ALSO MAKING UP CLAIMS ON BIOLOGICAL LABS AND THE SAUCY TOLD M.I.SIX THAT CHEMICAL WEAPONS COULD BE FIRED IN FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND ANOTHER WHO SAID THERE WAS ACCELERATED PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS THEY WERE LYING TOO
JOHN MORRISON HAD BEEN DEPUTY CHIEF OF DEFENCE INTELLIGENCE IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES I THINK IT WAS VERY MUCH M.I.SIX'S BECAUSE THEIR CHECKING PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN EVISCERATED
OVER THE YEARS THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROPER QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES THEY WERE NORMALLY ALWAYS HAVE GONE TO THE TECHNICAL EXPERTS TO MAKE SURE THE TECHNICAL DETAILS WERE CORRECT IN THIS CASE THEY DID NOT DO THAT ONE QUESTION FOR CHILCOTT IS WHY M.I.SIX GOT IT WRONG WAS IT JUST QUALITY CONTROL OR WAS IT TOO EAGER TO PLEASE ITS POLITICAL MASTERS
THERE WAS A SECOND INTELLIGENCE FAILURE ONE OF ANALYSIS AN ASSUMPTION THAT SADDAM HAD W.M.D. WAS NEVER CHALLENGED EVEN HIS INSPECTORS LED BY HANS BLIX ACTED ON THE INTELLIGENCE WE WENT TO ABOUT THREE DOZENS OF SITES THAT WERE GIVEN TO US
BY THE INTELLIGENCE U.S. AND U.K. AND PERHAPS SOME OTHERS BUT NONE OF THOSE CASES DID WE FIND ANY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION BUT I DO THINK THAT WHEN THEY HEARD FROM THE INSPECTORS THAT THEY SAY THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANYTHING AFTER ALL THEN THAT WAS BAD JUDGEMENT
TO GO AHEAD THE THIRD FAILURE FOR THE CHILCOT INQUIRY WAS THE WAY THE INTELLIGENCE WAS PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC THIS DOSSIER IS BASED ON THE WORK OF THE BRITISH JOINT INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
FOR EVER SIXTY YEARS BEGINNING WHEN TONY BLAIR ISSUED A DOSSIER ON THE WEAPONS HE RESTED HIS CASE ON THE EXPERTS OF THE JOINT INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE BUT THIS IS WHAT WE ARE TELLING ME THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER AND MY SENIOR COLLEAGUES THE INTELLIGENCE PICTURE THEY PAINT IS ONE ACCUMULATED OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS
IT IS EXTENSIVE DETAILED JOHN MORRISON WHO SERVED ON THE COMMITTEE ACCEPTS THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ANALYSIS HAD FLAWS BUT STILL BELIEVES THE PUBLIC PRESENTATION WRONGLY STRIPPED AWAY THE CAVEATS AND CAUTIONS ABOUT THE LIMITS OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY WAS OVERSTATED IN THE PRIME MINISTER'S INTRODUCTION WAS POSITIVELY HYPERBOLIC
HE SAID IN PARLIAMENT YOU KNOW IF YOU SAW THE AMOUNT OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH CROSSES MY DESK EVERY DAY TRACK OF COURSE CAN'T REVEAL ARE YOU WILL BE CONVINCED THERE WAS NO SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE FAILURES WERE CONSEQUENTIAL NOT JUST BECAUSE INTELLIGENCE WAS USED TO JUSTIFY WAR BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE LEGACY
WE'VE HEARD RECENTLY ABOUT PROJECT FEAR ABOUT DISTRUST OF EXPERTS AND IF YOU WANT TO LOCATE THE WELL SPRING OF PUBLIC SCEPTICISM ABOUT THE CLAIMS OF POLITICIANS AND THE WARNINGS HAVE THE EXPERTS THEY POINT TWO FOR VALIDATION THEN THERE IS PERHAPS NO BETTER PLACE TO START THAN IRAQ AND ITS MISSING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND IT WAS GORDON PEREIRA REPORTING AND WE'LL BE HEARING FROM LORD BUTLER HAD SHARED THE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR A VIEW OF INTELLIGENCE ON WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THE BUTTER REVIEW AT TEN PAST
# TIME NOW FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT THE TIMES LEADS ON ACCLAIM FROM THERESA MAY'S CAMP IN THE TORY LEADERSHIP ELECTION THAT UKIP IS PLOTTING TO INSTALL ANDREA LETS HIM AS PRIME MINISTER IT SAYS MISSUS LED SIMMS PROMISED TO TRIGGER BRITAIN'S FORMAL E. U. X. IT MORE QUICKLY THAN ARRIVALS HAS WON HER HUGE SUPPORT AMONGST WHAT IT CALLS HARDLINE BRICKS OR TEARS THE I PAID NEWSPAPER BELIEVED THE TORIES ARE EDGING TOWARDS A TWO WOMAN CONTEST BETWEEN THERESA MAY AND ANDREA LET'S
THE SUN HOWEVER SAYS IT'S A CONTEST FOR HEAVYWEIGHTS AND THAT SHOULD MEAN THERESA MAY AND MICHAEL GOES THE MANAGER OF BORIS JOHNSON'S ABORTIVE LEADERSHIP BID BEN WALLACE M.P. LEAVES THE DAILY TELEGRAPHS READERS IN NO DOUBT THAT MICHAEL GO IS ONE PERSON HE DOES NOT WANT TO SEE WINNING IN AN ARTICLE HE SAYS THINGS STARTED TO GO WRONG WITH MISTER JOHNSON'S CAMPAIGN FROM THE MINUTE MY CAME ON BOARD WITH A LEEK A DATE IN THE PRESS AND HE SAYS TO GO SPECIAL ADVISER DOMINIC CUMMINGS HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON EM PEAS AND ARSENIC
WHOEVER LEADS THE PARTY SAYS HAS TO BE TRUSTWORTHY AND ULTIMATELY WHAT MATTERS IN A CAMPAIGN IT'S HOW YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF THE DAILY EXPRESS HIGHLIGHTS LEGAL ATTEMPTS TO STOP WHOEVER BECOMES PRIME MINISTER FROM TRIGGERING ARTICLE FIFTY WITHOUT LEGISLATION APPROVED BY M.P.S THE PAPER SAYS IT'S SPARKED OUTRAGE OF WARNINGS OF RIOTS ON THE STRICT ACCORDING TO THE SUN A SNEERING TONY BLAIR SPARKED FURY YESTERDAY WITH HIS SUGGESTION THAT BRIDGE KEEP ITS OPTIONS OPEN OVER LEAVING ME BECAUSE
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE COULD CHANGE THE PAPER CALLS HIM A RIB MANIAC ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN LABOUR'S PREPARING FOR A DEAL TO AVOID A MISTER ERIC SPLIT IN THE BATTLE OVER THE PARTY'S LEADERSHIP THE PAPER SAYS THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OF A COOLING OFF BETWEEN THE TWO SCIENCE WITH MISTER CORBIN'S ALLIES CONSIDERING WHAT TYPE OF DEAL MIGHT SATISFY THE REBELS POWELL'S OF JEREMY CORBIN HAVE TOLD THE DAILY MIRROR HE'S ENJOYING HIS BATTLE WITH M.P.S AS HE AND JOHN MCDONNELL THE GUYS WHO FOUGHT ALL THEIR LIVES AGAINST THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY
# AN EDITORIAL IN THE PAPER SAYS THE CLAIM IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE AND IF IT IS TRUE MY ORGAN SHOULD REMEMBER TO SMILE NOT FROWN IN PUBLIC SIR CLIFF RICHARD PAULL GAMMA GENIE IN THE FORMER DEPUTY SPEAKER OF THE COMMONS NIGEL EVANS ARE PICTURED IN SEVERAL PAPERS CLASPING HANDS IN A DISPLAY OF SOLIDARITY HEADLINE IN THE DAILY MAIL CALLS THEM THE SURVIVORS' CLUB THE THREE MET YESTERDAY TO TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE OF BEING FALSELY ACCUSED OF SEXUAL OFFENCES THE MALE TALK TO THEIR REPUTATIONS BEING SHREDDED BEFORE THEY WERE CLEARED OF ALL ALLEGATIONS NIGEL EVANS IS QUOTED SPEAKING OF THEIR HELL
# AND SAYING THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE LAW SO THOSE ACCUSED OF SUCH CRIMES ARE NOT NAMED UNLESS THEY'RE CHARGED AND FINED ACCORDED THE TIMES A GOVERNMENT BACKED REPORT HAS RECOMMENDED THE T. JUNCTION SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH MINI ROUNDABOUTS TO MAKE ROADS MORE PENSIONER FRIENDLY MINISTERS HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT HIGHWAY SHOULD BE RE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT BRITAIN'S AGEING POPULATION CAN REACH FRIENDS SHOPS IN THEIR G.P.S
LESS RISK OF INJURY IT IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EAT WHEN YOU GO ON A JOURNEY OF A BILLION AND A HALF MILES REALLY WANT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU GET THERE AND WE HAVE ALL BEEN ON SUCH A JOURNEY
# WHETHER WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT OR NOT WITH THE JUNO SPACECRAFT BECAUSE IT'S TAKEN HUMAN INGENUITY AND CURIOSITY FAR FAR FROM EARTH TO THE OUTER REACHES OF JUPITER JUNO HAS LAUNCHED WAS LAUNCHED FIVE YEARS AGO IT HAS PRETTY MUCH ARRIVED AND IT'S PREPARING TO GET CLOSE TO THE PANEL
TO ITS HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT IT WAS A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AGO PASSED INTO JUPITER'S ELECTRIC FIELD AND THE INSTRUMENTS ON BOARD THE PROBE ARE ABLE TO RECORD THE SOUND OF WHAT HAPPENED
WELL THERE WE ARE THAT'S THE SOUND COMING FROM ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES TRAPPED IN A LOW DENSITY CAVITY AT THE EDGE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD THAT AT LEAST ACCORDING TO NASA ADAM MASTERS IS HERE WORKS ON A EUROPEAN MISSION TO JUPITER CALLED JUICE THAT'S DUE TO BE LAUNCHED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING I SUPPOSE THE PLACE TO START IS JUST ONE BECAUSE IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO MY GOODNESS WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS IN THEIR TIME BUT IN ALL THAT TIME IT'S BEEN GOING AT SOME SPEED
HURTLING UP TOWARDS STUPID YES AT GREAT SPEED SO FOR A TYPICAL MISSION TO JUPITER YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TIME FROM LAUNCH TO WHEN YOU ENTER INTO ORBIT AS GINO'S ABOUT TO DO OF SOMETHING LIKE FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS SO IF GINO'S FIGHT IS AS YOU SAID LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND ORBIT INSERTION IN JUST OVER TWENTY HOURS' TIME AND HOW MUCH COMMUNICATION AT THAT
DISTANCE AT HOW MUCH CAN A MINUTE BY MINUTE IF ANY COMMUNICATION CAN IT HAVE WITH WITH WITH US THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SO THE LIGHT TRAVEL TIME FROM JUPITER TO EARTH IS FORTY EIGHT MINUTES AND SO IF YOU SEND A SIGNAL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT FROM THE SPACECRAFT FORTY EIGHT MINUTES LATER WE HEAR ON THE GROUND
SO THAT MEANS THEY'RE MINUTE BY MINUTE CONTROL ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN EXACTLY SO A LOT OF THE OPERATIONS A LOT OF MANOEUVRES THE SPACECRAFT HAS TO EXECUTE A PRE
PLANNED AND WE SEND COMMANDS THE SPACECRAFT MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS IN ADVANCE RIGHT INCLUDING PRESUMABLY THIS ALL IMPORTANT THING THAT WE WERE HEARING ABOUT EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME WHERE THERE IS A KIND OF BRAKING SYSTEM IT'S ACTUALLY RUN THE ENGINES FOR I THINK THIRTY FIVE MINUTES IS THAT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THAT'S PROGRAMMED IT HAS AN AUTOMATIC THING IT EITHER HAPPENS OR IT DOESN'T THAT'S RIGHT SO THIS IS THE WHAT WE CALL THE ORBIT INSERTION BONE AS YOU SAID IT'S WHEN WE FIRE THE MAIN ENGINES TO SLOW DOWN THE SPACECRAFT BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU WON'T BE CAPTURED BY JUPITER'S GRAVITY
SO IT'S A VERY SORT OF NERVE WRECKING TIME BUT NOW WE'VE GOT A VERY GOOD HERITAGE OF DOING THIS SUCCESSFULLY THAT DONE IT BEFORE THE GALLAGHER SPACECRAFT AND IF IT WORKS WHAT THEN IF IT WORKS AND WE BEGIN THE REAL REASON WE'VE GONE TO JUPITER WHICH IS THE SCIENCE WAS DESIGNED TO DO SO IT'S GOING TO BE A PIONEERING MISSION IT'S GOING TO GO CLOSER TO JUPITER AND ANY SPACECRAFT EVER GONE AFTER TWO RELATIVELY LARGE CAPTURE ORBITS WE GO INTO A MUCH SMALLER SHORTER DURATION SCIENCE ORBIT SO WE GO VERY CLOSE OVER THE NORTHERN POLAR REGION
NOW THE MAIN SCIENCE OR JUNIOR DESIGNED TO DO IS TO EXPLORE THE ORIGINS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND HOW JUPITER FORMED SO THE KEY QUESTION IS HOW MUCH WATER IS THERE IN THE DEEP ATMOSPHERE WHAT'S THE INTERIOR STRUCTURE OF JUPITER LIKE AND WE HAVE VERY LITTLE IDEA ABOUT THAT WHICH IS WHY OF COURSE WE'VE LAUNCHED SUCH A HI TECH MISSION
BUT IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL IT IS ANSWERING SOME PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS EXACTLY RIGHT SO IT'S A VERY FOCUSED ON THE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS OF HOW THE SOLAR SYSTEM FORMED WHAT WAS DUPED HIS ROLE IN IT WE THINK DUPE IT WAS THE FIRST PLANET TO FORM SO IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT BODY PARTLY AS EVIDENCE BUT HOW LARGE IT IS
THAT'S THE SCIENCE WILL THERE BE PICTURES OF COURSE LOTS OF PICTURES ARE ALREADY BEEN WHICH IN THEMSELVES BE FASCINATE EXACTLY I THINK THERE'S A MOVIE ON THE NASA WEBSITE SHOWING A FULL ROTATION OF JUPITER THERE WAS ALSO A HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE CAMPAIGN WHERE THE FAMOUS HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE LOOKED AT JUPITER
THE WHOLE PLANET AND OF COURSE ALSO THE AURORA EMISSIONS AND A GROUP IN THE U.K. IN LEICESTER WERE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THAT AT YOUR CRAFT IS DUE TO BE LAUNCHED TWENTY TWENTY TWO DID DOING WHAT
SO THE FOCUS OF THE JUICE MISSION SEDUCES EASTON'S FIRST SO CALLED L. L. CLASS MISSION WITHIN THEIR COSMIC VISION PROGRAM WHICH MEANS IT'S A LARGE MISSION IS A FLAGSHIP AND THE FOCUS IS DIFFERENT TO JUNO THE TWO MISSIONS TO BE VERY COMPLIMENTARY IN TERMS OF DOING TUBULAR SCIENCE DEUCE IS DESIGNED TO REALLY EXPLORE AS WELL AS THE WHOLE JUPITER SYSTEM
I SORT OF ANALOGUE OF OTHER GAS GIANT SYSTEMS THERE'S A REAL FOCUS ON THE GALILEAN MOONS SO THESE ARE THE FOUR ALMOST PLANET SIZED REGULAR MOONS VERY CLOSE TO JUPITER ORBIT IN A PLANE THAT WERE FIRST SEEN BY GIRL EFFORT TELESCOPE HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO AND YOU'RE LAUNCHING TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH WITH ANOTHER FIVE YEARS BEFORE YOUR CRAFT GUEST SO THE TIME FROM LAUNCHED TO ORBIT INSERTION PRODUCE A LITTLE BIT LONGER
THAT THE TIME FOR THE TRANSFERS VERY SENSITIVE TO WHERE THE PLANETS ARE AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO SO A TRANSFER TIME IS SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS SO WE LOOK WE'RE LOOKING AT ORBIT INSERTION IN TWENTY TWENTY NINE
WELL GOOD LUCK WITH IT AND YOU MENTIONED EAST EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY IT WAS THAT'S RIGHT HE'S NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR OPINION OR AT LEAST HIS MEMBERSHIP OF IT ISN'T GOING TO BE ABLE I BELIEVE SO THERE ARE COACHES WHO ARE YOUR JOB'S NOT AT RISK I HOPE NOT ADAM MASTERS STAG
# IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER IN AUSTRALIA THIS MORNING'S FRANCIS CAMPBELL VICE CHANCELLOR OF SAINT MARY'S UNIVERSITY IN LONDON MORNING GOOD MORNING CALLUM GOOD MORNING
TODAY THE FOURTH OF JULY MARKS THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADOPTION OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND A BRICK WITH GREAT BRITAIN
BUT CALLING AT THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WITHOUT ON PACKING HOTHEAD MEANS COULD BE MISLEADING
TRUE IT DECLARES INDEPENDENCE FROM GREAT BRITAIN BECAUSE THEN COLONIES WERE NOT ABLE TO SECURE JOSS TREATMENT FROM KING GEORGE THE THIRD
BUT THE DECLARATION IN ITS LANGUAGE AND SENTIMENT IS ABOUT THE NEED TO DEPEND ON ONE ANOTHER IT SAYS WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT AND IT GOES ON THAT ALL ARE CREATED EQUAL WITH GOD GIVEN RIGHTS
IT CONCLUDES AND FOR THE SUPPORT OF THIS DECLARATION WITH A FIRM RELIANCE ON THE PROTECTION OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WE MUTUALLY PLEDGE TO EACH OTHER OUR LIVES OUR FORTUNES AND OUR SACRED HONOUR
IT IS NOT A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE FROM EACH OTHER NORTH FROM GOD MORE A DECLARATION OF SEPARATION AND A STATEMENT OF INTER DEPENDENCE ON ONE ANOTHER WITH A NEW COMMUNITY
WHAT IT SHOWS FOR A SOUL REGARDLESS OF NATIONALITY IS THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING THE BALANCE RIGHT BETWEEN INDEPENDENCE AND INTERDEPENDENCE
WE CAN ONLY EXERCISE OUR INDEPENDENCE AS HUMANS BECAUSE WE WERE FIRST DEPENDENT AS CHILDREN RELIANT ON NURTURING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES WE WERE FIRST PROTECTED AND THEN AND STAGES TRAINED TO TAKE A NEW STEPS AND OUR LIFE ALWAYS NAVIGATING AND BALANCING OUR INDEPENDENCE WITHIN SOCIETY
WE WILL AGAIN BE RELIANT ON NURTURING COMMUNITIES TOWARDS THE END OF OUR LIVES FOR RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS BALANCING OUR INDEPENDENCE WITHIN A COMMUNITY IS ALSO A TASK
CHRISTIAN'S PROFESSOR FIERCE AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT IT IS ALSO A SET OF SHARED BELIEFS HELD DEAR BY A COMMUNITY A FIERCE BIND TOGETHER REGARDLESS OF EARTHLY DIVISIONS
MANY CHRISTIANS ARE BAPTISED AS INFANTS DEPENDENT AT THAT TIME ON THE FIERCE OF PARENTS AND GODPARENTS TO A TEST FOR THEM AND TO MAKE THE PROFESSION OF FEAR
AS ADULTS THEY REPEAT THAT SAME PROFESSION ARE FIERCE AND REAFFIRM THEIR PROMISES EACH EASTER WHICH PARENTS AND GODPARENTS MADE FOR THEM AT THEIR BAPTISM
ON THIS FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND REAPPRAISE OUR OWN INDEPENDENCE AND IT'S HEALTHY LIMITATIONS AND ORIGINS AND REFLECT ON THOSE AND OUR FAMILIES COMMUNITIES AND SOCIETIES WHO HELP US KEEP A PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN THE I AND THE WEE
FOR IT IS IN THE MEETING OFF UNIQUE HUMAN DIFFERENCES THAT CIVILISATIONS ARE BORN NATURALLY AND AND WRETCH
# AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH FRANCIS CAMPBELL THE TIMES TEN TO EIGHT WE DON'T HAVE TO LET IT BE A DISASTER THE JOB OF THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER IS TO PREVENT PEOPLE BECOMING POORER AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THAT IS THE SOMEWHAT LESS THAN EUPHORIC FORECAST OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF LEAVING THE E.U. MADE BY A FOREIGN SECRETARY TODAY
PHILIP HAMMOND IS ENDORSING THERESA MAY AS HIS FAVOURITE CANDIDATE TO MOVE INTO NUMBER TEN AND THE JOINT IS ON THE LINE FROM WESTMINSTER MORNING MISTER HAMMOND MORNING NOW THE STOCK MARKET IS HIGHER THAN IT WAS THE POUND IS LOWER WHICH IS A GOOD TRADING OPPORTUNITY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ARE LINING UP TO DO TRADE DEALS WITH US ISN'T IT TIME YOU CHEERED UP AND STOP BEING PROJECT GLOOMY
ONE QUITE CHEERFUL MICK BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS IN THE FACE OR HEAD WE'VE GOT TO NEGOTIATE THE RIGHT DEAL WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT IS HEAVILY STRUCTURED AROUND ACCESS TO THE EUROPEAN MARKET AND WE NEED TO RETAIN AS MUCH OF THAT ACCESS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN
THUS MINIMISING ANY DAMAGE TO OUR ECONOMY FROM LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION AND AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO EXPLOIT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THERE WILL BE OVER THE LONGER TERM OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE COULDN'T DO BEFORE GOT TO DO BOTH OF THOSE TWO THINGS IN PARALLEL IF WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT THE BRITISH PUBLIC FROM THE IMPACTS OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND REALISE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THERE WILL BE IN THE FUTURE YOU'VE TALKED OF A. CENTRAL TRADE OFF BETWEEN ACCESS TO THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET AND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IN PLAY MAN'S LANGUAGE
OR YOU SIMPLY SAYING TO THE PUBLIC IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FEWER Y. U. IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY YOU WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT SOMEWHAT LOWER ACCESS TO THAT SINGLE MARKET
I THINK THAT THE NEW POLITICAL REALITY FOR US HERE IN BRITAIN IS THAT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT CANNOT OPERATE IN THE WAY IT IS OPERATED UP TO NOW THAT'S THE CLEAR UNDERLYING DECISION THAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE WERE TAKING ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD AND WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IN THIS ARTICLE IS RATHER THAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME DANCING AROUND THAT WE OUGHT TO ACCEPT IT HEAD ON WE OUGHT TO TALK TO
EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURS NOT THE COMMISSION IN BRUSSELS BUT BILATERALLY TO THE KEY COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND EXPLORE THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WE CAN HAVE THAT RESPECTS THAT CENTRAL
POSITION BECAUSE IT'S NO GOOD PRETENDING WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MESSAGE FROM THE BRITISH PEOPLE WITH WAS ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF COURSE IT WAS LEAVE THE E.U. BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT IT WAS DO SOMETHING TO GET CONTROL OF THE FLOW OF IMMIGRATION INTO BRITAIN WE'VE GOT A DEAL WITH EUROPE THAT ALLOWS US TO DO THAT IS PART OF THAT DEAL
THREATENING THE E.U. CITIZENS WHO ARE CURRENTLY HERE MAY HAVE TO GO HOME WHEN THE HOME SECRETARY WHO AFTER ALL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS YOUR CANDIDATE TO GO INTO NUMBER TEN IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME WHEN SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY SHE SAID AND I QUOTE
WE HAVE TO FACTOR THAT INTO NEGOTIATIONS WHEREAS OTHER PEOPLE BORIS JOHNSON MICHAEL GET OVER SAID LET'S BE CLEAR PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE FROM ME YOU ARE HERE FULL STOP
CERTAINLY NEITHER E.U. NATIONALS IN BRITAIN NOR BRITISH NATIONALS IN THE E.U. COUNTRIES WILL FIND ANY CHANGE IN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BUT WORDS THOUGH ISN'T IT OVER THE NEXT YES YES IT IS YOU COULD SIMPLY SAY COULDN'T YOU THEY'RE ALL HERE THEY'RE HERE TO STAY LOOK I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE NEGOTIATION WITH YOU PARTNERS INCLUDING AROUND FREEDOM TO MOVE FREEDOM TO WORK FREEDOM TO STUDY AND FREEDOM TO SETTLE AND I HOPE
WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO A POSITION WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO SAY TO THOSE E.U. NATIONALS WHO LIVE IN THE U.K. AND TO THOSE BRITS WHO LIVE IN E.U. COUNTRIES EVERYTHING'S FINE YOU CAN STAY AS YOU WERE BUT WE CAN'T ASSUME THAT WE'VE GOT TO NEGOTIATE
THAT WITH OUR FORMER EUROPEAN WHY YOU KNEW JUST DECLARE IT BECAUSE THERE'LL BE PEOPLE WITH GERMAN OR FRENCH OR POLISH NEIGHBOURS OR PLUMBERS OR NANNIES OR WORK MATES WHO WERE SAYING PHILIP TO REASON A. ARE PUTTING THEIR FUTURE ON THE LINE THIS MORNING AS PART OF SOME DEAL
NICK WHEN YOU GO INTO A NEGOTIATION ALL THE PARTS ARE MOVING ALL THE PARTS ARE ON THE TABLE AND IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO MAKE A UNILATERAL COMMITMENT ABOUT E.U. NATIONALS LIVING IN THE U.K. WITHOUT AT THE VERY LEAST GETTING A SIMILAR COMMITMENT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION UNDERSTOOD ABOUT BRITISH NATIONALS LIVING IN THE Y. YOU'VE GOT A VERY INTERESTING SENTENCE IN YOUR ARTICLE IN THE TELEGRAPH TODAY SIMPLY DOING ART AND YOU PUT IT IN QUOTATION MARKS STUBBORN BEST
BY DEMANDING ACCESS TO THE MARKET WHAT'S OFFERING NOTHING IN RETURN MAY SOUND BRAVE BUT WOULD BE FOOLHARDY DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY PARTICULARLY IN MIND WHEN HE WROTE THAT SENTENCE
THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE HERE IS THAT BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IS ALREADY SHAKEN BY THIS DECISION AND INVESTMENT FLOWS WILL BE REDUCED IN CONSEQUENCE WE COOK WHAT WE CAN'T DO IS SPEND A LONG PERIOD OF TIME
DEMANDING THINGS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT WE KNOW ARE NOT REALISTIC INTERESTING YOU TO PHRASE IT ON AND HOW DID HE I MEAN YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING MY SALMON IN QUOTATION MARKS IS THE PHRASE STUBBORN BEST USED IN AN EMAIL FROM MISSUS MICHAEL GO TO MISTER MICHAEL GO ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HE SHOULD DO THAT HE SHOULD BE AT HIS STUBBORN BEST SO THIS IS A CODED WAY OF SAYING MICHAEL GAVE HIS PROMISING YOU STUFF THAT HE SIMPLY CANNOT DELIVER
YES IT IS AND NOT VERY HEAVILY CODED I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THAT TO GET THE BEST OUT OF A NEGOTIATION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION FORMER PARTNERS AND TO DO IT QUICKLY WE NEED A PRAGMATIC APPROACH WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC WE NEED TO ACCEPT THAT THE TERMS OF TRADE MUST CHANGE BECAUSE
THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE VOTED DECISIVELY AGAINST THE KIND OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THAT WE'VE SEEN UNDERSTOOD WE HAD TO DO THAT KELLY'LL DECODING YOU'VE JUST CALL FOR OLD FASHIONED BRITISH PRAGMATISM YOU ALSO IN YOUR ARTICLES ARE THE TIME FOR DOGMATIC RHETORIC IS PAST MY GOATS RHETORIC
AND DOGMATISM LOOK THERE WAS A LOT OF RHETORIC DURING THE CAMPAIGN PROBABLY ON BOTH SIDES BUT WHAT THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT THAT DEBATE IS OVER THE BRITISH PEOPLE OF DECISIVELY VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ALL THE CANDIDATES IN THIS LEADERSHIP
COMPETITION ACCEPT THAT THAT DECISION HAS BEEN MADE SO THE QUESTION NOW IS NOT DO WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IT'S HOW TO GET THE BEST DEAL WHO IS THE PERSON WHO WAS PRIME MINISTER WILL BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THE BEST DEAL FOR BRITAIN PROTECT OUR ECONOMY AND ENSURE THE BEST OUTCOME FOR BRITAIN IN THE MEDIUM AND LONG TERM PHILIP HAMMOND THANK YOU JOIN US

DESPITE GOING OUT THE TEAM WERE PRAISED BY THOUSANDS OF FANS WHO ATTENDED THE MATCH I WATCHED IT ON A BIG SCREEN IN REYKJAVIK ICELAND SPORTS MINISTER IN THE GOOD ORSON SAID THE PLAYERS HAVE DONE THEIR COUNTRY PROUD ABSOLUTELY
WHAT A LIFE IN THIS GAME AT
THE PERFORMERS EVEN THOUGH I WAS I'M HAPPY WITH THAT
# LEGGY GOODNESS AND THERE THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT THIS WEEK WE'LL SEE THE PUBLICATION OF THE CHOKE AT REPORT INTO THE IRAQ WAR IT'S IRAQ CONTINUES TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISORDER THAT FOLLOWED THE DOWNFALL OF SADDAM HUSSEIN ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN PEOPLE DEAD IN ONE BOMB ATTACK AT THE WEEKEND
WE WILL TURN OUR MINDS ONCE AGAIN HERE TO THE FATEFUL DECISIONS THAT LED TO THE WAR AND TO THE CALAMITIES THAT CAME AFTER IT THE LOSS OF LIFE AND THE CHAOS THE POLITICAL FALL OUT FROM WEDNESDAY'S PUBLICATION IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE HUGE NOT LEAST FOR TONY BLAIR WHO WAS ACCUSED BY SOME IN HIS OWN PARTY HAVE BEING A WAR CRIMINAL
IN A MOMENT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR OF A PREVIOUS REPORT INTO IRAQ BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THE BUTLER HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE THAT PROVIDED THE BASIS FOR WAR AND FOUND MUCH OF IT WANTING BUT FIRST LET'S TURN TO OUR MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BYRNE WHO IS NINE FOR US FROM BAGHDAD AND JEREMY JUST AN APPALLING WEEKEND
ABSOLUTELY APPALLING TERRIBLE VIOLENCE AWFUL SADNESS AND A REMINDER REALLY OF THE
HESITATE TO USE WORDS LIKE THIS BUT THE CATASTROPHE THAT IRAQ HAS SUFFERED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE IT'S POSSIBLE TO TRACE A DIRECT LINE FROM THE INVASION THROUGH THE
CONFUSION THAT FOLLOWED THAT THE VIOLENCE THE GREAT SPINNING VORTEX OF VIOLENCE THE THE COALITION TROOPS DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO CONTROL THE COUNTRY AND THROUGH THAT TO THE THE ARRIVAL OF JIHADISTS INTO THE COUNTRY THE EMERGENCE OF A SECTARIAN WAR BETWEEN SHIAS AND SUNNIS NOW LOTS OF OTHER
PLAYERS MADE IT WORSE TO IRAQ IRAN
BUT THE FIRE WAS SET
BY AMERICA AND BRITAIN AND LIT BY AMERICA AND BRITAIN AND WHAT NOW FOR IRAQ JEREMY I AND IS THERE ANY REALISTIC HOPE ANOTHER THEM PARTITION THAT THAT CHAOS WILL COME TO AN END ANY TIME SOON
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REALISTIC HOPE OF THE CARERS WERE COMING TO AN END ANY TIME SOON A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE TALK ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF A CIVIL WAR BETWEEN SHEARS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY SHIA MILITIAS NOW IF AND WHEN THEY DEAL WITH THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF THE JIHADISTS OF ISLAMIC STATE DASH
SO THE DIFFICULTY HERE IS THAT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS DISCREDITED IT'S A LONG IT'S IT'S BUILT ALONG SECTARIAN LINES MANY OF THE PLAYERS AND POLITICS HAVE MILITIAS BEHIND THEM IT'S DESPERATELY UNSTABLE IN THE NORTH THE KURDS HAVE GOT THE ONLY AREA OF STABILITY WHICH IS THEIR OWN DISC THERE A REGION WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AS INDEPENDENT AS YOU CAN BE WITHOUT HAVING
NATIONAL FLAGS AND BEING A MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS SO THE REST OF IRAQ THE THE ARAB PART OF IT IS IN A TERRIBLE STATE AND WAS BAD AS WELL IS THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE HAVE BEEN FELT ACROSS THE REGION ESPECIALLY THAT WHOLE BUSINESS OF SECTARIANISM SECTARIAN VIOLENCE
AND THE SPREAD OF EXTREME SONY JIHADIST MOVEMENT GERRY BYRNE IN BAGHDAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET US TALK TO LORD BUTLER BUTLER FORMER CABINET SECRETARY WHO CHAIRED THAT TWO THOUSAND FOR A VIEW OF INTELLIGENCE INTO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THE BUTLER REVIEWS IT BECAME THEN GOOD MORNING TO YOU IT WON'T YOU ACCEPT JEREMY BURNS' POINT THAT WE ARE ESSENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MESS
I DO THOUGH I THINK THAT THE MAIN PROBLEM WAS THE INADEQUACY OF THE PLAN AFTER THE WAR I THINK THAT WAS LARGELY DOWN TO THE AMERICANS NOT TO US AS JEREMY SAID IT WOULD HAVE NEEDED FAR MORE RESOURCES TO BE PUT IN TO SEAL THE ARMS DUMPS TO SEAL THE BORDERS
AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT THERE WAS A VOID INTO WHICH THE INSURGENTS COULD COME AND IT WAS MADE WORSE BY DISMANTLING THE IRAQI STRUCTURE OF
OF GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH WE DID SAIL INTO BASRA DIDN'T WIN SOUTHERN IRAQ RATHER THINKING IT WOULD BE LIKE NORTHERN IRELAND WE HAD SPECIAL TALENTS THAT COULD PACIFIED IT WAS WHERE THE BEST NAIVE AND THAT IS AN ERROR ISN'T IT THE CHOKER HAS HIS LUCKY YES IT IS AND WE'LL SEE WHAT YOU GOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK WE DID HAVE SPECIAL TALENT SPOKE THE TASK WAS REALLY BEYOND VIVA
KAT WAS OUT OF THE BAG REMIND US OF WHAT YOUR REPORT ESSENTIALLY FOUND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY CHOKE AT HIS BUILDING ON IT TO SOME EXTENT YOU LOOKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE BUT BUT NOT JUST AT THE AT THE INTELLIGENT ALSO HOW WAS HE YES I THINK WHAT I COULD SUM UP WHAT A REPORT FOUND WAS THAT TONY BLAIR DIDN'T LIE TO US ABOUT THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT WORD W.M.D. AS INDEED DID MOST OF THE INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES IN THE WORLD HE WANTED TO BE IN HELPING THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS A DANGEROUS PERSON TO THE WORLD OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND THAT THE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM
MY CRITICISM OF HIM WAS ABOUT THE WAY HE REPORTED THE INTELLIGENCE HE EXAGGERATED THE RELIABILITY OF THE INTELLIGENCE DELIBERATELY
I WOULDN'T SAY DELIBERATELY DID VERSE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT ISN'T IT YOUR D. YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING HE EXAGGERATED ABILITY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT MADE A CASE THAT WAS THE RIGHT CASE TO MAKE EXACTLY EXACTLY HE WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE THE UNITED NATIONS OF THE WORLD THAT THERE WAS A PROPER LEGAL BASIS FOR TAKING MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ IN FACT OF COURSE THE JOINT INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAD SAID TO HIM THAT THE INTELLIGENCE WAS SPORADIC AND PATCHY
HE SAID TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IT WAS EXTENSIVE DETAILED AND AUTHORITATIVE AND THAT WAS WHERE THE INCONSISTENCY I DON'T CALL THAT A LIE HE MAY WELL HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF THAT IT WAS EXTENSIVE DETAILED AND AUTHORITATIVE BUT IT WASN'T BUT WAS IT AN ERROR OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE WHO DO YOU THINK THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE NOTED AT THE TIME IN TWO THOUSAND FOR NOT LEAST BY MISTER BLAIR HIMSELF
WELL I REMEMBER VIVIDLY THAT WHEN THERE WAS THE DEBATE ON MY REPORT MICHAEL HOWARD WAS ASKED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HE WAS THEN THEY'D WRITTEN THE WHEN HE WAS LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY DID TONY BLAIR MISLEAD THE HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY AND MICHAEL HAD WASN'T PREPARED AT THAT POINT TO SAY THAT HE WAS GIVEN A DIFFERENT ANSWER THEM THINGS HAVE MUCH HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY DO YOU THINK TONY BLAIR SHOULD HAVE RESIGNED
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE AND AT THAT POINT NO BECAUSE I THINK HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT HE WAS DOING WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS RIGHT AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT IN THE GREAT SPEECH HE MADE TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE EVE OF THE INVASION HE DIDN'T REALLY RELY ON THE INTELLIGENCE ABOUT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION HE RELIED ON ANOTHER ARGUMENT WHICH WAS IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION NOW AND IN TEN YEARS' TIME SADDAM HUSSEIN IS STILL A POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST ARMED WITH A NUCLEAR WEAPON
WOULD WE EVER FORGIVE OURSELVES IT WAS REALLY AN ARGUMENT LOOKING BACK TO THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THERE IS A HUGE ARGUMENT NOW AND THERE WILL BE POST CHOKER ON WEDNESDAY ABOUT THE LEGALITY OR THE ILLEGALITY OF THE WAR ITSELF DID DID YOU LOOK AT THAT AT ALL YES BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT INTELLIGENCE BORON BUT WE DID SEE THE ADVICE THAT WAS GIVEN BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
AND IT'S WELL KNOWN BIRTHS A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE INVASION THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID YOU WOULD BE VERY MUCH BETTER WITH A SECOND U.N. RESOLUTION TO AUTHORISE THIS
WE DIDN'T GET THAT SECOND RESOLUTION AT THAT POINT THE ATTORNEY SAID WELL NONETHELESS DID THE EARLIER RESOLUTION RESOLUTION ONE FALL FOR ONE OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL JUSTIFIED MILITARY ACTION
AND HE CAME TO THE VIEW THAT YES IT DID AND IS THEM MORE INFORMATION NOW THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO CHOKE AT THAT WASN'T AVAILABLE TO YOUR THAT WAS OUTSIDE THE INVESTIGATION IS THE MORE INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BEAR ON THAT QUESTION DO YOU THINK WELL THERE CERTAINLY IS MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO CHILCOTT BECAUSE WHAT THE PAPERS I SAW WERE ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE I DIDN'T SEE THE PAPERS ABOUT THE POLITICAL
EXCHANGES BETWEEN US AND THE AMERICANS WHICH CHILCOTT WILL HAVE SEEN AND THAT MAY INDEED THROW MORE LIGHT ON MATTERS OF THAT SORT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE REPORT IS THAT THERE WON'T BE A LEGAL ILLEGAL
PRONOUNCEMENT BY CHILCO AT AND THAT IT'S NOT A LEGAL COMMITTEE AND ONE ASSUMES THAT THAT IS PROBABLY THE CASE THAT'S GONNA LEAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WHAT WHAT'S THE POINT OF ALL THIS WELL I THINK THE POINT OF IT ALL WAS
PARTLY BECAUSE A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM THE BUT RELIEVED TO SEE THE PEOPLE WHO'D TAKEN THE DECISION BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT AND THAT WAS THE PUBLIC HEARINGS BUT ALSO OF COURSE THE TERMS OF REFERENCE COVERED ALL THE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED POLITICALLY AND MILITARILY FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TWO TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IT WAS A VAST REMIT TO HAVE DO YOU THINK
WELL I THINK THE PROBLEM FOR GOVERNMENTS IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS PRESSURE FOR EVERYTHING TO BE COVERED AND GOVERNMENTS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SAY NO WE'RE GOING TO NARROW IT DOWN WITH US PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE COVERING SOMETHING UP FOR WE'RE NOT SATISFIED SO THERE IS ALWAYS IS THAT PRESSURE
BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED IT TOOK SO LONG BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS THE VASTNESS OF THE REMIT THEN THERE WAS THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES ABOUT WHAT WE COULD SAY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EXCHANGES WITH TONY BLAIR THEN THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF GIVING PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE CRITICISED THE CHANCE TO MAKE THEIR REPRESENTATIONS AT FINALLY CLEARING WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WERE PUBLISHED
WHAT COULD BE PUBLISHED SO I I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT IT'S TAKEN AS LONG AS IT HAS BUT I THINK IT WILL BE AN EXTREMELY THOROUGH
PIECE OF WORK WILL WE KNOW IF IT'S TWO POINT SIX MILLION WORTH OF SEEMS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY WHEN YOU THINK THE COFAIDH THEN U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL WAS ABLE TO SAY ACTUALLY NA B. B. C. INTERVIEW YES I THINK THE WAR WAS ILLEGAL SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY THAT AFTER ALL THIS AND A REPORT NOW THAT WE'RE TOLD IS WHAT THREE TIMES THE LENGTH OF THE BIBLE THAT WE'RE STILL NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE THAT FOR OURSELVES WELL THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION CHILCOTT WAS ASKED TO DEAL WITH WHAT HE WAS ASKED TO DEAL WITH WAS WHAT HAPPENED
NOT ONLY IN THE LEAD UP TO THE WALL BUT DURING THE WAR AND AFTER THE WAR AND WHAT LESSONS CAN BE LEARNED FROM IT SO THE LEGAL ISSUE WASN'T ACTUALLY PUT TO HIM AND OF COURSE HIS REVIEW TEAM WASN'T EQUIPPED PROPERLY TO DEAL WITH THAT LEGAL ISSUE
JUST TURNING BACK TO IRAQ AND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW VERY BRIEFLY AT THE END I MEAN IT IS A PRETTY GLOOMY DESPERATE SITUATION IS IT I JUST WONDER WHETHER LONGER TERM WEATHER REPORTS LIKE YOURS REPORTS LIKE CHILCO
WILL CONTRIBUTE YOU WERE SOMEONE HAS BEEN ON THE INSIDE OF GOVERNMENT FOR SO LONG WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER WAY OF DOING THINGS IN THE FUTURE WELL ONE'S ALWAYS GOT TO HOPE THAT LESSONS WERE LEARNT NO SITUATION IS THE SAME BUT JUST DEALING WITH MY REPORTS
YOU CAN SEE THE MISTAKES THAT DECEIVED THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY INTO THINKING THAT SADDAM HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION I'VE TALKED TO THAT ABOUT THAT TO THE AGENCIES AND I HOPE THAT THEY HAVE LEARNT THE LESSONS FROM IT INDEED I KNOW THEY HAVE LEARNED A LOT OF THE LESSONS FROM IT AND INTELLIGENCE WON'T BE MISUSED IN FUTURE ROBIN BUTTER MORE BUTTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# TWENTY MINUTES PART TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT I THINK OF A ROBOT AND MOST OF US WILL THINK OF A MACHINE THAT MAYBE COULD TAKE OVER A HOUSEHOLD CHORE WE MIGHT EVEN WORRY ABOUT THE LOSS OF BRITISH JOBS BUT ROBOTS THOSE THAT EXIST NOW LET ALONE THOSE YET TO BE INVENTED HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS CARERS ARE ROBOTIC CONFERENCE AT THE SCIENCE MUSEUM TODAY IN LONDON WILL FEATURE SOME OF THEM AND IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING WE HAVE CASPER GOOD MORNING CASPER

I SUPPOSE IS A HUMANOID ROBOT IT'S CHILD SIZED IT HAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF HER MAYBE THREE YEAR OLD CHILD IT'S IT'S WEARING CLOTHING CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S CLOTHING SO WE HAD TO GO SHOPPING I HAVE TO ADDRESS CASPER CASPER HAS FEATURES THAT ARE A LIKE BUT SIMPLIFIED SO IT'S REALISTIC HUMAN LIKE FEATURES BUT MUCH MORE SIMPLIFIED THEN HUMAN FEATURES BECAUSE CASPER'S MAIN
JOB SO TO SPEAK IS TO TRY TO HELP CHILDREN WITH AUTISM TO LEARN ABOUT COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION QUITE SIMPLY THAT THEY TALK TO THEIR ROBOT THEY TAUGHT CASPER THEY ARE TALKING TO CASPER THERE INTO ACTING WITH CASPER THEY'RE TICKLING CASPER TACTILE INTO ACTION
IS ACTUALLY QUITE IMPORTANT IN I WAS SO WE HAVE PROGRAMME DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAMES CHILDREN PLAY THESE GAMES WITH THE ROBOT AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE PRESENT A TEACHER OR PARENT OR ANOTHER CHILD SO THAT CASPER CAN HELP THEIR CHILD WITH AUTISM VIA THE ROBOT TO INTER ACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A CARER IT ISN'T JUST SAYING WE'LL LOOK WE HAVEN'T GOT THE MONEY SO WE'RE GONNA LEAVE YOU WITH A WITH A SMALL PERSON WHO JUST HAPPENS TO BE

AND ACTUALLY THAT HASN'T PRODUCED A LEVELS A BUSINESS INVESTMENT THAT WE'VE NEEDED AND IN FACT BUSINESSES INVESTMENT HAS BEEN FALLING BACK AGAIN AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN HAPPEN AS THE CORPORATION TAXES ARE BEING CUT AND THEN THE LARGE COMPANIES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN EARNED INCOME AND SITTING ON IT SO THERE NOW SITTING ON SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS' WORTH OF WELL EARNED INCOME THAT THEY SHOULD BE INVESTING WHAT WE NEED CAN I ALSO SAY ACTUALLY WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THIS CUP BECAUSE IT WILL MEAN TOUCH OTHER TAXPAYERS MIDDLE AND LOWER OWNERS HAVING TO PAY FOR IT WE'VE ALREADY
CURRENT PUB FOUR BILLION BUDGET HOLE IN OUR IN OUR FINANCES AT THE MOMENT AS A RESULT THE MISMANAGEMENT LAST BUDGET SO I THINK WHAT'S NEEDED IS FIRST OF ALL ONE STOP CUTTING GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT BRING FORWARD A PROGRAMME OF INVESTMENT SHOP ALREADY PROJECTS PARTICULARLY THOSE AREAS WHICH ARE FELT LEFT BEHIND AND VOTED LEAVE IF WE CAN DO THAT WE START STIMULATING ECONOMY AND THAT WILL GIVE CONFIDENCE TO INVESTORS AS WELL OH CAME HE HEARD US FORGIVE ME WE'RE SHORT OF TIME BUT IN A WORD YOU'RE SAYING BORROW DON'T CUT
I'M SAYING INVEST DON'T CUT TAXES IN THIS WAY COS YOUR SILLY SHIFTING THE TAX BURDEN AND YOU'RE CREATING THIS ALMOST AS A EUROPEAN TAX HAVEN AND I THINK THAT WILL UNDERMINE OUR NEGOTIATIONS WERE AXE CONSTRUCT AWAY FORDING EUROPE COMMODORE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
# THE TIME TWENTY TO NINE ALTHOUGH THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH HAPPENING HERE ON EARTH WE HAVE MADE SPACE THIS MORNING THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME FOR THE JUNO SPACE CRAFT WHICH HAS BEEN TRAVELLING FOR FIVE YEARS ONE AND A HALF BILLION MILES AND HAS ARRIVED AT THE PLANET JUPITER PROFESSOR FRAN BEGGAR NO AS A MEMBER OF THE JUNO SCIENCE TEAM AND ON THE LINE FROM PASADENA I ASKED HER WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN NOW FOR THE MISSION TO SUCCEED
WE NEED TO HAVE A FULL ENGINE BURN I'VE BEEN THIRTY FIVE MINUTES THAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW TWENTY FOUR HOURS FROM NOW AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS HOPEFULLY IT WILL ALL WORK WELL WE HAVE ACTUALLY USE THE ENGINES AT LEAST THREE TIMES BEFORE SO THEY'RE NOT UNUSED IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS SINCE WE LAUNCHED SO HOPEFULLY HE'LL GO UP BUT IT'S A VERY NERVOUS TIME FOR ALL SPACE MISSIONS
TRYING TO GET INTO ORBIT AROUND A PLAN AND IF THE ENGINES DON'T WORK WHAT THEN I THINK YOU WOKE AT ALL WE JUST KEEP FLYING HORN OUT YOU KNOW IT'S SYSTEM RIGHT IF THEY'RE PARTIALLY BURNT THEN MAYBE THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN RECOVER BUT IT'S A KIND OF CRITICAL MANOEUVRE OH KAY LET'S ASSUME THEY DO WORK WHAT HAPPENS THEN
WELL THEN WE GO INTO TWO LARGE ORBITS WE GET SORT OF PRACTISE AND GET USED TO WHAT'S GOING ON
THEN LATER IN THE YEAR IN IN SEPTEMBER OR SO WE END UP AT IT'S ACTUALLY EARLY OCTOBER WE GO INTO A SERIES OF SHORT ORBITS TOO WEAK OR BEDS THAT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THERE'S A SPACE FAR SURVIVES SO WHAT WILL WE BE SENT THEN IN THE WAY OF INFORMATION AND PICTURES ARE SET WHAT WILL IT CHANGE
PERMISSION DID YOU KNOW MISSION IS ACTUALLY LESS ABOUT PICTURES MORE ABOUT OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE PROBE OUR ENVIRONMENT WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY FIELD OF JUPITER THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF JUPITER IT WANT TO PROBE IT USING VARIOUS DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS MICROWAVES U.V. INFRARED AND SO ON
AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S INSIDE BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW HOW DO YOU COULD HAVE FORMED
AND HOW OUR SOLAR SYSTEM FORMED AND ARE WE NEED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW DO YOU COULD HAVE CALLED IN THEY KNOW WARWICK TO UNDERSTAND HOW
THE REST OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM CAME TO BE HOW MUCH CLOSER THEN IF THIS MISSION IS A COMPLETE SUCCESS HOW MUCH CLOSER DOES IT TAKE US TO TO ANSWERING THAT REALLY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION
OF THE OLD BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THEORIES ABOUT WHERE DO YOU COULD HAVE FORMED HOW THE SOLAR SYSTEM FORMED AND THEY HAD VERY DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES FOR UNDERSTANDING NOT ONLY A SYSTEM BUT ALSO FOR MANY OTHER SALT SYSTEMS ARE WE'RE NOW FINDING AROUND OTHER STARS AND SO
AH THERE'S AN ISSUE OF THE TIMING THE COMPOSITION AND THE PROCESS BY WHICH CELLS IS FORMED AND JULIE WILL PUT THIS DOWN WE'LL KNOW THE AMOUNT OF HEAVY MATERIAL SO WATER
HEAVIER ELEMENTS METALS AND ROCKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AS A DEEP INSIDE JUPITER AND AT THE END OF IT WHAT HAPPENS THEN TO THE SPACECRAFT IS PLUCKY SPACECRAFT WHICH HE'S COME AN AWFUL LONG WAY WELL WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO HIT YOU ROPER BECAUSE EUROPA MAY HAVE LIFE UNDERNEATH SEA ICE
SO WE DON'T WANT TO BRING EARTH BARKS WHICH WILL BE BRINGING WITH THE SPACECRAFT INEVITABLY AT SO WE PLAN TO ACTUALLY SEND SPACECRAFT INTO JUPITER'S BURNETT UP TO PROTECT HORRIBLE OR EUROPE OR BEING THE MA'AM ONE OF ONE OF JUPITER'S BIG SACK INTO THE LARGE BIG GALLEON IN ROBA GALLERY CLOSED
AND YOU THINKING SUCCESSFULLY DO THAT INVENTION IT'LL BURN UP IN IN JUPITER THAT'S A LOT EASIER TO ORGANISE THAN GETTING INTO ORBIT SO I'M NOT SO WORRIED ABOUT THAT WERE BEST OF LUCK WITH IT ALL AND AS YOU SAY WE'LL KNOW MUCH MORE IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS' TIME PROFESSOR FRAN BACK THANKS VERY MUCH
# IT IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO KNOW I KNOW MANY HAVE PREDICTED THAT THE E.U. WILL BE PUT UNDER GREAT STRAIN AND STRESS BY THE BRICKS IT VOTE BUT A NEW FAULT LINE HAS EMERGED IN AN UNLIKELY PLACE IT'S BANKING THE ITALIANS ARE REFUSING TO DO WHAT THE GERMANS ARE TELLING THEM TO DO AND DOMINIC O'CONNELL BUSINESS PRESENTER CAN TELL US MORE ABOUT THIS THIS IS ABOUT WHAT THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES
TO SUPPORT BANKS THAT ARE IN TROUBLE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY TELL HIM BANKS HAVE GOT INTO DEEP TROUBLE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU MEASURE IT THEY HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY BILLION YEARS OF BAD DEBTS THAT TOOK TO ABOUT A QUARTER OF ITALY'S G.D.P. AND IT WAS BAD ENOUGH BEFORE THE BRICKS ABOUT BUT A BRICKS OF VOTE MADE THINGS WORSE HE SHARE PRICES WENT DOWN THIRTY PER CENT ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT AND THAT THEY REALLY NEED TO BAIL OUT THE BIG QUESTION THOUGH IS HOW DO YOU HELP THEM
ONE OF EUROPE'S BIG RESPONSES TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BANKING CRISIS ENTER THE EURO CRISIS WAS TO PUT IN PLACE I THINK OF THE EUROPEAN BANKING UNION WHICH MADE THE STANDARD SORT OF RULES IF YOUR BANK'S GONE TO TROUBLE THIS IS WHAT YOU HAD TO DO IT YOU HAD TO DO X. Y. AND Z. BUT HE TELLING TO SAID WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANY OF THAT
A TEAR IN THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER IS IS PUT IN TO GET THE PLANS AS WIDELY REPORTED ITALY JUST A PUMP BILLIONS OF EUROS OF STATE MONEY INTO THE BANKS TO KEEP THEM AFLOAT ONE REASON THEY MIGHT WANT TO DO THIS IS HE FACES THE ELECTORATE AS WELL IT'S IT'S EVERY DECISION IN EUROPE IS ALWAYS CAUSED BY REFERENDUM OR BUY ANOTHER HE HE HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM COMING UP IN OCTOBER AND HE HAS SAID IF HE LOSES A REFERENDUM HE'LL RESIGN AND GET OUT OF POLITICS NOW CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING INTO A REFERENDUM AND ATTAIN REFERENDUM ON THE CONSTITUTION
HAVING TO BE PUTTING BANKS INTO ADMINISTRATION AND BANKRUPTING BUSINESSES PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF WORK HE JUST DOESN'T WANT TO BE IN THE EUROPEAN SEPHY VERY CAREFUL ANGELA MERKEL ASKED ME VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE HE PUSHES HIM TOO HARD HE MAY WELL BE OTHER POLITICS ALTOGETHER SO IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT THEY HAVE TO WORK SO THE TEMPTATION WILL BE TO JUST GO QUIET MAYBE FOR A LITTLE WHILE UNTIL HE CAN WIN I THINK WE'RE HEADING FOR A COLOSSAL EURGH FUDGE
ANOTHER OF THOSE DOMINIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE DEAD SEA IS ONE OF THE GREAT ECOLOGICAL TREASURES OF THE WORLD ARE SUPER SALTY LAKE THAT CAPTURES THE WATERS OF THE RIVER JORDAN IN A MOUNTAINOUS LANDSCAPE BETWEEN ISRAEL JORDAN AND THE OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES IT'S THE LOWEST POINT ON EARTH
NEARLY HALF A KILOMETRE BELOW SEA LEVEL AND FOR YEARS THERE'S BEEN A FEAR THAT THE SEA MIGHT LIVE UP TO ITS NAME AND DIE AS THE COUNTRIES OF THE MIDDLE EAST DRAIN THE RIVER SYSTEM FOR PRECIOUS DRINKING WATER BUT IF THE SEA ISN'T EXACTLY DYING SCIENTISTS SAY THE WATER'S TOO DENSE TO EVER DISAPPEAR ENTIRELY
IT IS CERTAINLY SHRINKING AT AN ALARMING RATE MORE THAN A METRE A YEAR OUR CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CONNELLY HAS BEEN TO WATCH
IF YOU WANT TO DIP YOUR TOES IN THE DEAD SEA THE ISRAELI RESORT OF INK EDDIE YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR IT WHEN THE RESTAURANT GIFT AND SHOWER BLOCK WAS BUILT THIRTY YEARS AGO THE WATERS WERE LAPPING AT THE WALLS NOW THE SEA IS SHRINKING SO FAR AND SO FAST IT'S A TWO KILOMETRE RIDE THE WAVES ON THIS TOURIST TRAIN
I WAS GOING TO SHOW YOU IN REAL TIME PROGRAMMES NOT LONG ENOUGH ALL THE ANCIENT MYSTIQUE REMAINS OF COURSE YOU CAN STILL COACH YOURSELF IN HEALTH GIVING MINERAL RICH MUD
AND THEN BOB ABOUT ON WATER'S SO THICK WITH SALT YOU CAN SIT UP RIGHT IN IT
STILL WORTH ALL THE TROUBLE I WAS ASSURED BY NOR TALLEAH HOLIDAYMAKER FROM UKRAINE I NEVER USED TO SMOTHER THE IMPORT IN HERE IS A PURSE I DON'T KNOW I'M SO IMPRESSED HOW DOES IT FEEL
SOME WARRIORS MAKE YOU HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER OR SOMEWHERE
ALL AROUND HERE THAT THINGS ARE CHANGING AT A FRIGHTENING PACE UNTIL LAST YEAR THIS WAS THE SHOP OF A THRIVING TOURIST BEACH ALL FLIP FLOPS AND SOME CREAM NOW THE DISPLAY CASES ARE STRIPPED BARE AND THE LIGHT FITTINGS ARE RIPPED OUT
GHOST TOWNS HAD LEISURE FACILITIES THIS IS WHAT THEY'D LOOK LIKE THAT'S BECAUSE SINKHOLES ARE OPENING UP ALL OVER THE AREA INCLUDING ONE LARGE ENOUGH TO SWALLOW HOLE THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR
IT'S WORRYING AND DRAMATIC THIS SPECIFICALLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO USED TO RUN THIS BITCH TO WORK IN IT AND FELL FOR THEM
IT'S A LITTLE DISASTER PROFESSOR GIDDY BEAR IS AN ISRAELI EXPERT ON THE SINKHOLES OPENING AROUND THE DEAD SEA AS IT SHRINKS LEAVING UNDERGROUND SALT DEPOSITS WHICH COLLAPSE BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THOUSANDS OF SINKHOLES HAVE OPENED UP IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND HE SEES IT CAN BE BAD FOR LOCAL BUSINESS GOOD TIME TO BE A GEOLOGIST THOUGH
FRANKLIN YES IT IS WELL IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PLACES LIKE GEOLOGISTS LOVED TO WORK ON VOLCANOES LIKE TO WEAR ON EARTHQUAKE WITH THINGS ACTIVE
IN THE PAST GEOLOGISTS WERE LOOKING AT A VERY ANCIENT FEATURES AND TIED TO PREDICT OR DO I DO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY FORMED HERE WITH SEE THOSE FEATURES FOR ME
IN FRONT OF OUR EYES SO OF COURSE IT'S VERY GOOD TO DO THAT AND SEE THAT IN REAL TIME TO SEE HOW I THINK ALL IPHONE TO FEAR HOW HE GROWS SO IT'S REALLY A GOOD PLACE FOR A GEOLOGIST TO WORK
ALL AROUND THE GOATS WHO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING GEOLOGY HAPPENING IN REAL TIME AND THE SALTY EARTH CRUMBLED BENEATH YOUR FEET QUITE SHATTERED CRYSTAL
THE LANDSCAPE'S EXTRAORDINARY IMAGINE THE GRAND CANYON BUT THEY KOMO PARKED AT THE BOTTOM
THE SEA IS DYING BECAUSE THE COUNTRIES OF THE MIDDLE EAST ARE TAPPING INTO THE WATERS OF THE RIVER JORDAN THE ONCE FED IT
A FIX IS POSSIBLE A GRAND SCHEME TO BUILD A PIPELINE ACROSS THE DESERT FROM THE RED SEA FAR TO THE SOUTH AND THAT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE BUT SELL ROUGH MAN FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP ECHO PEAS SO THEY WOULD BE WORTH THE MONEY
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT SERVING DID IT'S BECAUSE IT'S NICE I'D LIKE A NICE WE THINK THAT SAVING TO SEA IS AN INDICATOR OF SUSTAINABLE LIVING IN THE AREA BECAUSE THE DITZY IS A SIGN FOR A SYMPTOM OF SICKNESS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN THAT AREA
SO THAT'S WHY THEY SAID HE WAS A BIT IT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD INDICATOR THAT WE HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM SICKNESS TO HEALTHY CONDITION HOPEFULLY ENVIRON
ON BOTH SHORES OF THE DEAD SEA THE HOTELS ARE ALWAYS BUSY
FOR THE MAJESTY OF NATURE THAN THE QUALITY OF THE CABARET YOU SUSPECT BUT WITH EVERY YEAR THAT PASSES
THE WALK FROM THE BALCONY TO THE BEACH IT'S GOING TO KEEP ON GETTING LONGER AND LONGER
# KEVIN CONNOLLY REPORTING THERE IS NOW NINE MINUTES TONIGHT IS GLOBALISATION OVER IT'S A BIG QUESTION BUT IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION IT IS THE FEAR OF THOSE WHO SAY THAT THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND CAPITAL AND GOODS AND SERVICES ACROSS BORDERS IS A GOOD THING AND ONE THAT ENRICHES THE WORLD BUT
IS POTENTIALLY UNDER THREAT THREAT FROM THE IT VOTE OF COURSE BUT ALSO IN AMERICA AND THE RISE OF DONALD TRUMP AND THAT THOSE THINGS THREATEN NOT JUST THE PROSPERITY OF INDIVIDUAL NATIONS BUT THE PROSPERITY OF THE WHOLE WORLD'S ANY MINTON BETTER EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE ECONOMIST AND SO IS MARIANNA MATS ARE CARTOONS PROFESSOR ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX AND AN ECONOMIC ADVISER JEREMY CAUGHT THAT MORNING TO YOU BOTH
SUNNY FIRST OF ALL HOW MUCH OF A THREAT IS GLOBALISATION UNDER NOW WELL I THINK YOU PUT IT VERY WELL THERE'S A HUGE GROUNDSWELL OF POPULAR ANGER AGAINST TODAY'S GLOBAL ORDER WHICH IS IDENTIFIED AS GLOBALISATION WHETHER IT'S THE BRECK THEIR VOTE HERE WHETHER IT'S TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHETHER IT'S MARINE LE PEN IN FRANCE THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT TODAY'S WORLD DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE INCLUDING US AT THE ECONOMIST TO THINK THAT THERE ARE GREAT GAINS TO BE HAD FROM A LIBERAL INTERNATIONALIST GLOBAL WORLD ORDER I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT TO BOTH
DO A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING THE BENEFIT BUT ALSO MORE IMPORTANTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE PEOPLE SHARE IN THOSE GAINS AND IF THAT WAS TO BE DONE MARIANNA WHAT KIND OF PRACTICAL MEASURES NEED TO BE TAKEN
CAN I JUST SAY THAT I ACTUALLY DISAGREE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THE WORD GLOBALISATION ACTUALLY CAPTURES ANY OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT US PARTICULAR TYPES OF POWER RELATIONSHIPS THEY HAVE ACTUALLY ACCOMPANIED THE FREE MOVEMENT OF FINANCE CAPITAL TECHNOLOGY ETCETERA AND SO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE WORKING POPULATION PROPER EYE DEFENCE OF SQUAB ACTUALLY THE WORD DEFENCE US AS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE A FENCE THAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE WENT INDUSTRIES CLOSED DOWN WHETHER IT'S STEEL CALL
WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE ACTUALLY BE QUIET IN THOSE COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS OF JOBS IN THE FACT THAT THOSE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS HAD NOT IN FACT ACCOMPANIED THAT'S NOT AN ANTI GLOBALISATION POINT IS A POINT TO GLOBALISATION IS TO BE BUTTRESSED BY OTHER THINGS IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT AND I THINK THE WORDS FINANCIAL AS ASIAN PRIVATISATION DEREGULATION WHICH HAVE AGAIN ACCOMPANIED THESE OPENING UP THAT MARKETS ARE THE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE
I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT HERE IN THE U.K. THAT WE'RE NOW PRIVATISING EVEN THE LAND REGISTRY WHICH ACTUALLY WAS A PUBLIC ASSET THERE WAS BRINGING MONEY TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR WHICH THEN POTENTIALLY CAN INVEST IN ALL SORTS OF THINGS WHICH IN FACT ALLOW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING DE INDUSTRIALISED TOO TO YOU HAVE WE KNOW OF THAT'S THE PROBLEM AND ALSO THIS LACK OF INNOVATION POLICY INDUSTRIAL POLICY WHICH CAN ACTUALLY TACKLE THE REAL PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH ARE STAGNANT PRODUCTIVITY FOR DECADES
I DON'T THINK IT REALLY MATTERS WHAT SHOW AND WE ADD TO THIS WAGNER GIVE IT THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY ANGRY WITH THE WORLD TODAY WHO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND ANOTHER WORLD EST HELPING AND BENEFITING A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT THE KIND THAT THE SKILLS YOU HAVE THE INCOME WHO ARE MOBILE AND THEY I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT I THINK
IN A DEMOCRACY RIGHTLY WE NEED TO WORK OUT A WAY TO MAKE ENOUGH PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY ARE BENEFITING IN THE GAINS AND THE GAMES ARE VERY REAL REGAINED SOME TRADE A VERY REAL THE GAINS FROM THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE FOR AN ECONOMY OVERALL ARE VERY REAL AND I THINK WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO FEEL LEFT BEHIND WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE IN INDUSTRIAL CITIES WHERE THE INDUSTRY HAS MOVED WITH IT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO COMPETE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ECONOMY WE NEED TO EQUIP THEM WITH THOSE SKILLS AND DO A BETTER JOB AT KIND OF REMAKING THE WELFARE STATE LATER THAT WASN'T IT
WELL I THINK YOU'RE IT'S A BIT LATE AND MANY OF US HAVE BEEN ARGUING FOR A WHILE THAT YOU NEED TO DO MORE TO TO PREPARE PEOPLE FOR THIS KIND OF ECONOMY BUT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE I MEAN NEVER SAY NEVER IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO IMPROVE THINGS IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO FOCUS MORE ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE THIS COUNTRY COULD DO WITH A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO RETHINK ABOUT THREE THINK THE WELFARE STATE SO THAT IT FOCUSES SPENDING ON THOSE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED IT
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS AS WHY IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE KINDS OF SKILLS THAT PEOPLE REQUIRE IN ORDER NOT TO BE LEFT BEHIND AND IT'S NOT JUST IF YOU WANT THE LAC ENOUGH I BELIEVE PUBLIC SPENDING ALSO IN PARTICULAR AREAS OF HELP THAN HUMAN CAPITAL FROM ASIAN BUT ALSO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH IN RECENT YEARS I WOULD SAY THE LAST SORT OF THREE DECADES HAS NOT FOR EXAMPLE THAN REINVESTING ITS PROFITS WE HAVE RECORD LEVEL HOARDING RECORD LEVEL FINANCIAL AS ASIAN WERE PROFITS ARE NOT BEING REINVESTED BACK UNTIL
PRODUCTION HUMAN CAPITAL R. AND D. WE HAVE VERY LOW LEVELS OF BUSINESS R.&D. SPENDING IN THIS COUNTRY SO THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT KIND OF POLICIES ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO INCREASE THAT YOU CAN HAVE POLICY POLICY AND ALSO HAVE GLOBALISATION AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO SURE BUT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN THAT I MEAN I REALLY DON'T FIND HER GLOBALISATION VERY USEFUL IT IS ABOUT OPENING MARKETS BUT WHERE IS THE MARKET THE MARKETS AND OUTCOME AT THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS IN ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO INVEST IN NEW OPPORTUNITIES COULD INVENT WAYS SUCH AS THAT CASE ANNIE IT'S NOT FAIR THAT GLOBALISATION
TAKES THE RAP FOR THESE THINGS ME WHAT MAN AND SAYINGS A PENNY THINGS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING COULD BE DOING AND THAT SHE ARGUES FOR THAT ACTUALLY IN A SENSE SEPARATE FROM GLOBALISATION THEIR DECISIONS THAT CAN BE MADE IN GLOBALISED ECONOMIES OR IN THE ABSENCE OF GLOBE ABSOLUTELY I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT BUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S FAIR TO BLAME BLAME GLOBALISATION A LOT OF THIS ANGER IS TARGETED AT THIS KIND OF AN INTEGRATED GLOBAL WORLD AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLICIES THAT THOSE WHO WERE AGAINST IT APROPOS OWNING SO SAY DONALD TRUMP IN AMERICA
IT IS TO PUT UP THE BARRIERS IT IS PROTECTIONISM BRICKS IT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT BASICALLY IT'S DISENTANGLING BRITAIN FROM THE BIGGEST MARKET IN EUROPE SO WHETHER OR NOT WHATEVER WE CALL IT THE RESULT OF THIS ANGER IS WE DON'T LIKE THE WORLD AS IT IS AND THEREFORE WE WANT TO PUT UP BARRIERS
AND THAT LEADS US WHERE MARIANNA MATT'S CARTER IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL POLICIES THAT COME IN EUROPE IN A BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN A BRITISH NATION OUTSIDE THE
I MEAN I JUST FIND IT VERY INTERESTING THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO CHINA AND ASKING FOR A CHINESE LONG TERM CAPITAL PRECISELY BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH SHORT TERM FINANCE YOU'RE BOTH IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR BUT ALSO IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY LOTS OF SHORT TERM AS I'M SO THERE'S THIS IRONY THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE SELLING OFF OUR STATE ASSETS TO THE CHINESE STATE SO WE'VE SEEN A BATSMAN PURE IDEOLOGY IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A PUBLIC PRIVATE IS THAT IN THIS COUNTRY THE PUBLIC SECTOR IF YOU WANT US IN SOME WAYS WAS DISMANTLING ITSELF BECAUSE HE'D HAVE HAD A VISION
HOW PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAN REALLY WORK TOGETHER TOWARDS NO OPPORTUNITIES BUT YOU KNOW THE KIND OF RADICAL REFORMS THAT BY THE WAY WE ARGUE FOR ANNA BUT THAT'S COMING OUT NEXT MONTH CALLED ME THINKING CAPITALISM REALLY REQUIRE US TO RETHINK WHAT KIND OF FINANCE DO WE NEED
AND ALSO IN TERMS OF THE LABOUR MARKET WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT LABOUR MARKET RIGIDITY IS AND SOMEHOW THERE IS THESE IMPEDIMENT OUT THERE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S TAX REGULATION OR IN THE LABOUR MARKET I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO GET RID OF THIS NOTION THAT THERE IS AN IMPEDIMENT AND ACTUALLY ASK YOURSELVES WHAT DO WE NEED TO CREATE ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE FUTURE AND CERTAINLY DOES THIS WOW YOU'D CERTAINLY WEREN'T FAVOURITE AS BRECK SIR GIVE US AT LEAST THE OPPORTUNITY TO PAUSE AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO BE ECONOMICALLY IN THE FUTURE
WELL THE IRONY IS YES I THINK IT DOES AND I THINK ONE OF THE VERY SMALL SILVER LININGS FROM THIS IS THAT WE ARE HAVING THESE KIND OF DEBATES IN THIS COUNTRY ABOUT WHAT KIND OF A POLICY SET OF POLICIES WE NEED IN THE COUNTRY TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AND TO TO COUNTER THIS POLITICS OF ANGER BUT OF COURSE THE IRONY IS THAT WE'RE DOING IT IF WE WHEN WE LEAVE AND DEPENDING ON HOW WE LEAVE BY CUTTING OURSELVES OFF TO GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE FROM A HUGE MARKET THAT HELPS SUSTAIN THAT PROSPERITY SO IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION I WISH WOULD BE HAVING THE CONVERSATION WITHOUT THE BREAKS
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE MARKET BY THE WAY A BILLION EUROS AND THE HORIZON TWENTY TWENTY EUROPEAN COMMISSION INNOVATION FIND BY THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS IF YOU LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO BE LOSING OUT ON AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY IN A COUNTRY THAT CONTINUES NOT TO REALLY BUT HERE AND HAVING AN INDUSTRIAL AND JUST STOLEN EUROPEAN INNOVATION FAIR WE CAN SPEND AWAY WE WERE GIVING THEM MORE MONEY THAN WE WERE A SINK THAT'S THE POINT BRECK SYRTIS MAKERS THAT DOESN'T LIKE THE FOURTH AND WE KNOW THAT WELL NO WE WERE WE DID AND THE POINT THAT THEY MAKE IS IS THAT WE WERE NECK CONTRIBUTORS THE EUROPEAN
THERE'S A SIMPLE AS THAT ISN'T IT WHAT FOR A LODGER WEAKEST PARTS OF THE U.K. ACTUALLY WEREN'T YEAH CORNWALL IN WELL WE CAN BUT ALSO TERMS AGAIN COMING BACK TO SOME OF THE KEY FINANCING THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO REJUVENATE THE COUNTRY WE WERE ACTUALLY NET CONTRIBUTOR SUFFERING AND UP THE EUROPEAN WRIST AND THAT ISN'T THAT THE POINT WE HAVEN'T GOT LONG AND TWENTY SECONDS OR SAY THERE ARE THERE IS A RISK THAT PEOPLE WHO RAIL AGAINST GLOBALISATION ARE NOW GOING TO BE DAMAGED BY OF COURSE AT THE POST LET'S ABSOLUTELY A RISK ABOUT BED AND THEN THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE THE BIGGEST LOSERS IN FACT FROM A WORLD WHERE BARRIERS GO UP SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
THERE'S PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN GLOBALISATION WHICH FRANKLY INCLUDE SOME EXODUS MAKE THE CASE AND THEN THINK LONGER AND HARDER BUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO EQUIP PEOPLE TO GAIN FROM IT TURNED HIM INTO MEADOWS MARIE NEAR MARIANNA MASSIVE PARTY THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH R.
