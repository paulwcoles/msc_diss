# SIX MINUTES PAST SIX THERE HAS BEEN A PROMISE OF SOME I CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER IT CAME FROM PHILIP AVERY HIMSELF BUT HE IS A MAN AT THE B.B.C. WHERE THEY SEND THIS MORNING MY PHILIP JUSTIN VERY GOOD MORNING IF YOU CATCH ME SAYING THE WORD PROMISE HAS GONE VERY WRONG WITH THE WEATHER BUT ESSENTIALLY FOR ENGLAND AND WALES TODAY IT'S A PREDOMINANTLY DRY DAY I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT SOMEWHERE IN EXCESS OF NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF YOU WILL STAY DRIVE FOR THAT FOR ALL OF TODAY'S DAYLIGHT HOURS
THERE ARE SOME SHOWERS AT THE MOMENT I'LL CONCEDE THAT ACROSS THE WESTERN PARTS OF WALES ONE OR TWO RUNNING TOWARDS THE NORTHERN SHORES OF BOTH DEVON AND CORNWALL AND WE'VE GOT SOME COLD AIR ALOFT IN THE CHANNEL AS WELL AND THAT'S GENERATED SOME SHOWERS IN THE EASTERN CHANNEL THESE ARE AFFECTING THE CHANNEL COAST AT ONE OR TWO SPOTS AN INLAND AREAS OF THE SOUTH EAST NOW THESE WILL TEND TO FADE AWAY AND THEN THE OFF THEM SCUSE ME THIS AFTERNOON I THINK WOULD JUST FIND THE EASTERN COUNTIES
ONE OR TWO LIGHT SHOWERS AND THAT REALLY IS THE EXTENT OF IT AS OTHERS FADE AND HAVING HAD THE CROWD REACH A CRESCENDO AROUND ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IT WILL TURN TO PETER OUT AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON SO BE LONG SUNNY SPELLS NOT DOING THAT MUCH FOR THE TEMPERATURES THOUGH SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY ONE SHOULD JUST ABOUT HIT THE MARK
AND THERE TO NORTHERN IRELAND HERE AGAIN A PRETTY DRY FAIR I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT LATE ON IN THE DAY WESTERN AREAS WILL START CLOUDING UP THIS IS THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE RAIN OVERNIGHT BUT BEFORE THAT IT'S A REALLY DECENT SORT OF DAY TEMPERATURES AND RANGE OF FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN AND FINALLY TO SCOTLAND WELL HERE TOO ENOUGH CLOUD ACROSS THE NORTH AT THE MOMENT FOR ONE OR TWO SHOWERS
I THINK THERE'LL BE A LOT OF CLOUD AGAIN ACROSS THE SHETLAND ISLES BUT ELSEWHERE I THINK JUST ONE OR TWO SHOWERS LIGHT ONES AGAIN ACROSS THE EASTERN SIDE OF SCOTLAND THIS AFTERNOON BUT MANY WILL STAY DRY TEMPERATURES OF THIRTEEN TO NINETEEN
# THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS DOMINATED HAVE CAUSED BY THE ARRIVAL OF THERESA MAY AND DOWNING STREET THE FIRST APPOINTMENTS TO HER CABINET THE GUARDIAN MAZE PLEDGED TO BRECK'S IT BRITAIN FRONT PAGE HAS A PICTURE OF THE MAZE ON THE DOORSTEP OF TEN DOWNING STREET THE PAPER SAYS SHE MADE A SPEECH TO THE MIDDLE GROUND ON THE STEPS OF NUMBER TEN BUT THEN THE CABINET TAKES A TILT TO THE RIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE APPOINTMENTS
A BORIS JOHNSON AND DAVID DAVIES AND LIAM FOX TO THREE OF THE KEY ROLES THAT SHE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY MAY BRINGS IN THE BRACTS ARE TEARS AS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HEADLINED THE FINANCIAL TIMES MAY SWEEPS INTO DOWNING STREET WITH HAMMOND AS CHANCELLOR PHILIP HAMMOND REPLACING GEORGE OSBORNE HE'S BEEN SACKED WHICH IS WHY THE TIMES HEADLINE IS MAIZE
CLEAN BREAK THE DAILY MAIL HAS LITTLE FLORENCE CAMERON THOUGH ON THE FRONT PAGE OR CAMERON'S LITTLE CUTIE IS WHAT IT CALLS HER SHEEP STYLES ON THE SUN'S FRONT PAGE AS WELL WHICH HAS A PICTURE OF THE CAMERON FAMILY AND THE HEADLINE GO WITH THE FLOW
ON THE INSIDE PLEDGES PLENTY OF COMMENT OF COURSE ON THE INITIAL APPOINTMENTS WE HEARD ABOUT LAST NIGHT TREVOR CABINET IN THE SUN SAYING THAT THE APPOINTMENT SO FAR PROVIDE A STARK WARNING TO BRUSSELS THAT MISSUS MAY INTENDS TO MAKE BRICKS AT WORK IN THE BRITISH NATIONAL INTEREST NOT IN EUROPE IT'S THE DAILY TELEGRAPHS ALASTAIR HEATH ALSO IMPRESSED BY WHAT MISSUS MAY AT LEAST
STARTED WHEN THEIR WAY OF APPOINTMENTS HE SAYS AT THE SAME TIME AS THOSE APPOINTMENT SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY TURBO CHARGE HER BRECK'S IT DEPARTMENT SHE NEEDS TO MOVE HUNDREDS OF CIVIL SERVANTS INTO IT AND ORDER THE MANDARINS TO MAKE THIS THEIR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY TRADE NEGOTIATORS AS WELL AND NEED TO BE RECRUITED THERE IS NO TIME FOR A HOLIDAY SAYS ALASTAIR HEATH SIMON JENKINS IN THE GUARDIAN THERE A BIT MORE OF A WARNING OF WHAT HAPPENS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD MAZE CABINET WILL BE INEXPERIENCED HE WRITES
BUT HER OPPONENTS ON EUROPE WILL BE VETERANS CHINO THAT SHE MUST SOMEHOW NEGOTIATE THE EXIT OUT OF BRECHT'S IT SHE MUST CONSTRUCT A COMPROMISE THERE KEEPS TRADING GOODS SERVICES IN LABOUR FLOWING WHILE MEETING AT LEAST THE LETTER OF THE REFERENDUM AS SHE VENTURES INTO THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF BRECHT'S ET SON JENKIN WRITES HER EQUIVOCAL VOICE FOR REMAINING IN THE U. Y. YOU WILL
THE POLICE WILL SEEM LIKE MINOR FOES COMPARED WITH THE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT
# IT'S TEN PAST SIX WELL ARGUABLY THE MOST STRIKING IN THE MOST UNEXPECTED OF YESTERDAY'S APPOINTMENTS WAS THAT OF BORIS JOHNSON TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE HOW WILL HE HANDLE THAT BOWL AND HOW MUCH IS THERE IN THE DROPPER FOREIGN SECRETARY GIVEN THAT THERE'S A SEPARATE BRICKS IT DEPARTMENT AND A NEW INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEPARTMENT JAMES ROBBINS A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE IS IT A HOLLOWED OUT FOREIGN OFFICE
AT THE EXTREME END OF THE ARGUMENT IT CERTAINLY IS BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BRAKES NEGOTIATIONS HAS BEEN GIVEN A NEW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION DAVID DAVIS AND YET HAVING SAID THAT OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE WILL REMAIN CENTRAL NEGOTIATIONS PARTLY BECAUSE BORIS JOHNSON AS FOREIGN SECRETARY WILL MEET HIS EUROPEAN UNION COUNTERPARTS HIS FELLOW FOREIGN MINISTERS VERY VERY REGULARLY IT OCCUPIES
A VERY LARGE PART OF THE TIME OF ANY FOREIGN SECRETARY HE'S ACTUALLY DUE TO MEET THOSE COUNTERPARTS FOR A WORKING DINNER IN BRUSSELS ON SUNDAY AND WE KNOW ALREADY THAT BRICKS IT WILL DOMINATE THE MENU NOW HE'S NOT GOING TO GET INTO DETAILED NEGOTIATIONS OF COURSE PARTLY BECAUSE BRITAIN HASN'T TRIGGERED ARTICLE FIFTY DECLARING ITS INTENTION FORMALLY TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE SUBJECT ROUND THE TABLE I'VE ALREADY FRANCE'S EXTENDING ITS PUSH FOR A QUICK BRITISH TRIGGER TO GET INTO NEGOTIATION SO YOU CAN SEE THAT
BORIS JOHNSON AS FOREIGN SECRETARY WILL HAVE TO PLAY INEVITABLY PLAY AN INTIMATE PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS EVEN IF HE SHARES THAT RESPONSIBILITY WITH OTHERS AND PLAY A DIPLOMATIC RODNEY HE WILL BE BRITAIN'S TOP DIPLOMAT AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY WE KNOW HIM FOR A WEE WONDER HOW HE WILL HANDLE THAT
I THINK GIVEN BORIS'S HISTORY OF WHAT MIGHT POLITELY BE CALLED GAFFES DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT VARIOUS FOREIGN LEADERS INCLUDING IT HAS TO BE SAID THE PRESENT THAT ESTATE'S BARACK OBAMA THE CERTAINLY GREECE HAVE RAISED EYEBROWS AROUND THE WORLD IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT
A SPOKESMAN THERE SAID THAT THEY WOULD WORK WITH WHOEVER WAS THE FOREIGN SECRETARY OF THIS WENT BEYOND PERSONALITY BUT YOU CAN SENSE ALREADY THAT PEOPLE ABROAD AT LEAST WILL BE PRETTY SHOCKED BY THIS THINKING THIS IS AN ODD PERSON FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW TO PUT IN CHARGE OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND OF COURSE BORIS JOHNSON HAS A REPUTATION FOR CHARMING PEOPLE
PERHAPS LESS THE POLITICAL ELITE BUT CHARMING PEOPLE AND HE'S WOO PLENTY FOREIGNERS BEFORE HIS FOREIGN TRAVELS AND AS YOU SAID SO HE'S GOING TO BE FACE TO FACE WITH HIS FELLOW EUROPEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS STILL FELLOW EUROPEAN UNION FOREIGN MINISTERS NEXT WEEK SO EVEN IF HE'S NOT RESPONSE OF THE BRECHT NEGOTIATIONS NEGOTIATIONS TO THEM HE WILL BE THE PUBLIC FACE OF THEM
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO STRESS I MEAN YES THE DETAIL WORK MAY BE DONE BY A NEWLY CREATED DEPARTMENT BUT THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE OUT THE BRICKS AT NEGOTIATIONS FROM THE WORK OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND THE FOREIGN SECRETARY I THINK
IT DOESN'T BEAR MUCH EXAMINATION I MEAN HE AFTER ALL AS FOREIGN SECRETARY WILL BE
IN ESSENCE NUMBER TWO IN THE HIERARCHY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH OTHER EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS THAT THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT THE PRIME MINISTER OF COURSE IT'S NUMBER ONE BUT IT AT THE SUMMIT WHO DO WE SEE WE SEE
AT THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT THE PRIME MINISTER WE SEE OFTEN THE FOREIGN SECRETARY AND HE'S THE ONE WHO REGULARLY SITS DOWN TO CRUNCH THROUGH ALL THE MAJOR ISSUES CONFRONTING THE EUROPEAN UNION
WITH THEM SO THAT HIERARCHY HE HAS TO PLAY A VERY LARGE ROLE SO THE IDEA THAT HE COULD BE MARGINALISED SIMPLY BY DEPARTMENTAL REORGANISATION I THINK IS
# JAMES ROBBINS THANK YOU TIME THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE VERY SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS BEING MADE AGAINST HUNGRY THIS MORNING BY A VARIETY OF HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS IT REFERS TO THE TREATMENT OF REFUGEES WHO ARE TRYING TO GET INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION FROM THE BORDER BETWEEN HUNGARY AND SERBIA AND NICK THORPE IS THERE ON THE HUNGARIAN SIDE OF THAT BORDER ON WHAT'S BEING SAID ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
JUST NOW ACTUALLY I'M JUST ON THE HUNGARIAN SIDE OF THE BORDER THIS IS WHERE ALL THE POLICE AND ARMY ARE CONCENTRATED JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE
ARE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN A TENSE MAKESHIFT SHELTERS AND JUST AS I'M SPEAKING HE'S ACTUALLY BECOMING QUITE
DRAMATIC NOT SMART BECAUSE OF THE POLICE MEASURES THIS TIME BUT BECAUSE OF THE
WHETHER IN VERY VERY HOT HERE THE LAST FEW DAYS THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES PEOPLE TRYING TO SHELTER FROM THE SUN BUT A STORM IS JUST BREAK
OUT A VERY STRONG WIND BLOWING AND YOU CAN SEE ARE SOME OF THE SHELTERS ACTUALLY BEING BATTERED BY THIS WIND
BLANKETS BEING BLOWN AWAY OUT OF WHICH THE SHELTERS ARE SO THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM NOW FOR THE MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ON THE FAR SIDE OF THIS BORDER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS RAZOR WIRE FENCE A IS THE IS THE
BUT THE ALLEGATION AGAINST THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT IS IS WHAT EXACTLY THAT THEY FORCE PEOPLE BACK WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T DO UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT THEY'VE DONE IT TO VIOLENTLY WHAT'S WHAT'S BEING SUGGESTED ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOUR EGGS EXACTLY
WHAT'S THE NEW REGULATIONS WHICH CAME INTO FORCE LAST WEEK SO ON THE FIFTH OF JULY THEY ALLOW HUNGARY TO RETURN PEOPLE
UP UNTIL THEN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PEOPLE WERE CROSSING ILLEGALLY THROUGH THIS RAZOR WIRE FENCE EACH DAY ARE WHAT THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES AND CAN NOW DO IS ROUND THEM UP EFFECTIVELY AND PUSHED THEM BACK THROUGH GATES IN THIS RAZOR WIRE FENCE OR INDEED OVER THE FRIENDS IT'S
AND WHAT THE HUNGARIAN POLICE AND ARMY ARE BEING ACCUSED OF HERE IS MISTREATING THEM USING EXCESSIVE FORCE AS THEY DO THAT NOT JUST EIGHT KILOMETRES INSIDE AS THE LAW ALLOWS WHAT WE'VE HEARD REPORTS OF TWENTY FIVE FIFTY KILOMETRES FURTHER IN SOME OF THE MIGRANTS I'VE SPOKEN TO SAYING THAT THEY WERE
PUNCH KICKED HAD PEPPER SPRAY STRAIGHT IN IN THEIR FACES AS THEY WERE BEING RETURNED
OTHERS FAMILIES SAYING THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE RECEIVING BETTER TREATMENT SEEMS TO BE THE SINGLE MALE MIGRANTS
MISTREATED OR ALLEGED THEY WERE MISTREATED IN THAT WAY
# NEXT UP ON THE HUNGARIAN BORDER THERE WITH SERBIA THANKS SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THIS COULD BE THE DAY THE BANK OF ENGLAND CUT INTEREST RATES IF SO IT WOULD BE THE FIRST MOVEMENT IN RATES AND SEVEN YEARS DOMINIC O'CONNELL HAS MORE IN THIS MORNING'S BUSINESS NEEDS MORNING DOMINIC THANK YOU MICHELLE MORNING YES THERE'S A WIDE EXPECTATION AT THE BANK'S MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE WILL CUT RATES TODAY
HAVE BEEN AT NOUGHT POINT FIVE PER CENT FOR SEVEN YEARS EVER SINCE THE BANKING CRISIS WHICH IS THE LOWEST I'VE EVER BEEN BUT NOW THEY MIGHT GO EVEN LOWER MARK CARNEY BEGUM OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND GAVE A BIG HEMP LAST WEEK THAT A RATE CUP WAS COMING IN RESPONSE TO WHAT HE CALLED THE ECONOMIC SHOCK OF THE REFERENDUM
WITH ME IS MARTIN BECK HE'S A SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE ITEM CLUB WHOSE OPINIONS ARE ALWAYS CLOSELY WATCH BECAUSE IT USES THE SAME ECONOMIC MODEL AS HER MAJESTY'S TREASURY MARTIN WHAT'S YOUR EXPECTATION FOR WHAT THE M. C. WILL DO TODAY AND WE THINK THAT THE M.P.C. WILL PROBABLY CUT RATES BY A QUARTER OF THE SENTENCE POINTS ARE DOWN TO NOUGHT POINT TWO FIVE PER CENT SO MARK ON ITS HEAD LAST MONTH AT THE M.P.C. REDUCE TODAY'S MEETING TO MAKE HER AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK WITH A FULLER ASSESSMENT NEXT MONTH THEY WILL PROBABLY SEE SOME ACTION TODAY
POSSIBLY FURTHER INTEREST RATE CUTS OR MORE I'VE STATE OF EASING HAPPENING NEXT MONTH I JUST JUST TO EXPLAIN THIS WHY DO CENTRAL BANKS CUT INTEREST RATES WHAT'S THE POINT OF DOING IT WELL IT STIMULATES THE ECONOMY IF YOU'RE PER BORROWER IF YOU'VE GOT A MORTGAGE OR A QUICK TUMOUR CREDIT LINE YOU'LL BE PAYING LESS AND INTEREST PAYMENTS
LOWER INTEREST RATES ALSO WORK BY WEAKENING THE CURRENCY IN BY PUSHING UP THE VALUE OF ASSETS LIKE SHARES ARE MAKING PEOPLE FEEL WEALTHIER SO IT WORKED FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CHANNELS SO IF HE DOES US TODAY ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE SHARE MARKET SHOULD GO UP THE POUND SHOULD WEAKEN AND IN THE REAL ECONOMY PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE CHEAPER MORTGAGES
AND MORE EXPENSIVE IMPORTS LOOK THAT'S RIGHT THERE ARE SOME DOWNSIDES YOU SO WE COULD MEAN MORE EXPENSIVE IMPORTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT WOULD PROBABLY ENCOURAGE
SHE WAS THE SHIFT SPENDING TOWARDS DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED GOODS AND SERVICES SO THE WEAKER POUND WORKS FOLK BY FRUIT EXPORTS BUT ALSO ON A DOMESTIC ECONOMY AS WELL IT'S BAD NEWS FOR SABRES ISN'T IT IT'S A DISINCENTIVE TO PEOPLE TO SQUIRREL MONEY AWAY IT IS ALTHOUGH SAVINGS RATES ARE ALREADY SO SO LONELY THAT I DON'T THINK IT'LL MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE AND OF COURSE AT THE MOMENT IF THE INTENTION IS TO GET PEOPLE TO GO AND SPEND AND TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMY
SAVING ISN'T NECESSARILY GOOD THING ENDA AND DEB YOU TOUCHED ON THE POINT THEY WERE ALREADY HAD VERY LOW INTEREST RATES FOR A VERY LIGHT THE LONG TIME THERE'S A QUARTER OF A PER CENT CUT ACTUALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL TO WHAT PEOPLE DO IT WON'T MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE WAS A LOWER INTEREST RATES DON'T JUST WORK BY CUTTING THE RATE YOUR PONY MORTGAGE THERE'S ALSO THESE OTHER CHANNELS FOR A COULD I'M HIGHER WEALTH SO
THAT THE EFFECT WILL BE MODEST BUT THEY WILL PROBABLY BE GREATER THAN THAT JUST LIKE THAT THAT'S SOLD EFFECT ON THEIR LOWER BORROW LOW BORROWED IT HAS A WIDER SORT OF AURA A FIT DOESN'T IT THAT'S RIGHT A BIT A BIT BOOST CONFIDENCE AS WELL AND BOOTS EXPECTATIONS AT THE BANK CAN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMY NUMBER CARNEY HAS HEAD HAS TO TRACK THE LAST WEEK SAYING THAT BY COMING OUT SO STRONGLY AFTER THE VOTE AND TALKING ABOUT HER RATE CUT
HE'S ACTUALLY TIED THEIR HANDS OF THE M.P.C. WHICH IS MEANT TO BE INDEPENDENT HE'S ONE OF ONLY NINE MEMBERS DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TOO FAR THAT HE'S ACTUALLY A BIT TOO POWERFUL I DON'T THINK SO I THINK GIVEN THE SURPRISE OF THE VOTE TO LEAVE IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT SOMEONE WITH STATURE IN POLICY MAKING CAME OUT AND SAID THAT
THE GOVERNMENT THE POLICY MAKERS COULD DO SOMETHING TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMY SO I THINK IT'S GOOD WHAT HE DID AS YOU SAY HE'S JUST ONE OUT OF NINE ON THE COMMITTEE BUT I GUESS I WAS GOVERNOR HE'S BUSY HE DOES CARRY A BIT MORE WEIGHT THAN THE AVERAGE MEMBER ON THE COMMITTEE IF HE CONTINUES IN THIS JOB BUT OF COURSE THE PERSON WHO APPOINTED HIM GEORGE OSBORNE HAS NOW LIFT THE TREASURY HOW DO YOU THINK HISTORY OR REMEMBER GEORGE OSBORNE'S HER TIME IN CHARGE
# I THINK DISAPPOINTING IF WE LOOK AT THE RECOVERY OF THE ECONOMY SINCE TWENTY TEN IT'S BEEN VERY WEAK I THINK THE FIXATION ON DEFICIT REDUCTION WAS PROBABLY A MISTAKE THAT THE CHANCELLOR COULD ABUSE FISCAL POLICY MUCH MORE TOWARDS SUPPORTING GROWTH RATHER THAN FOCUSING SOLELY ON RAISING TAXES AND CUTTING PUBLIC SPENDING THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARTIN BAKER THAT HE WHY ITEM CLUB YESTERDAY THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE PUBLISHED A REPORT ON BRITAIN'S PLAN TO BUILDING NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS
HE ESTIMATES OF THE TOP UP PAYMENTS WE'LL ALL HAVE TO MAKE TO THE OWNER OF THE PLAN HINKLEY POINT STATION HAVE RISEN BY AN EXTRAORDINARY SUM FROM SIX POINT ONE BILLION WHEN THE CONTRACT WAS SIGNED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS A NET SOMEONE EFFIE FOUND
BY BILL PAYERS LIKE YOU AND I WE ARE SIMON AUDIT MANAGER AT THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE WHAT HAS CHANGED WHAT WE'VE LOOKED AT IN THE REPORT IS THE DEAL FOR HINKLEY POINT C. THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROVISIONALLY AGREED WITH E.D.F. AND THE DIOR CENTRES ON A CONTRACT FOR DIFFERENT SQUARE BY GOVERNMENT HAS AGREED TO FIX THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT E.D.F. WILL RECEIVE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY HENTY POINT SEE FOR THE FIRST THIRTY FIVE YEARS THIS MEANS THAT IF THE PRICE THAT E.D.F. CAN RECEIVE
FROM THE MARKET FOR THAT ELECTRICITY THE WHOLESALE PRICE IS LESS THAN THE AMOUNT AS AGREED IN THE CONTRACT THAT E.D.F. WILL RECEIVE TOP UP PAYMENTS WE'VE SHOWN IN OUR REPORT IS THAT THE FORECAST VALUE OF THOSE TOP UP PAYMENTS HAS INCREASED WHEREAS IN OCTOBER TWENTY THIRTEEN EXPECTING TOP UP PAYMENTS
WAS AROUND SIX POINT ONE BILLION POUNDS THE LATEST ESTIMATE GOES UP TO TWENTY NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS SO THAT'S TWENTY NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS OVER THE THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF THE CONTRACT FOR DIFFERENCE AND THAT BEGINS AT THE POINT AT WHICH HITLER POINT C. STARTS GENERATING ELECTRICITY E.D.F. EXPECTS THAT TO BE IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE ALSO ARE SIMON ABOUT THE RISKS THAT STILL EXIST OF THE PROJECT AND WHAT BIG INVESTORS WANT BEFORE THEY WILL INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN BRITAIN
WHETHER THE DEAL GOES AHEAD HIS DECISION FOR E.D.F. AND THE GOVERNMENT'S BUT WHAT WE'VE SHOWN IN THIS REPORT IS THAT SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE DO HAVE CHANGED ITS NEGOTIATIONS BEGAN WE ALSO DESCRIBED THE VALUE FOR MONEY RISK RELATED TO THE WIDER MARKET CONDITIONS TO GOVERNMENT IS RELIANT ON PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTORS TO COME FORWARD WITH NEW GENERATING CAPACITY BUT IF A NUCLEAR ROUND ANOTHER LOW CARBON GENERATING SOURCES WHAT WE HIGHLIGHTED IS THAT UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE MARKET CAN BE A RISK THAT INVESTMENT COMING FORWARD
WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO EXTRA GOVERNMENT SUPPORT BEING REQUIRED WHICH WERE THEN MEAN HIGHER COSTS POTENTIALLY FOR CONSUMERS THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY APPROACH IS THAT NEW INVESTMENT IN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE IS PAID FOR BY ENERGY BILL PAYERS RATHER THAN THE TAXPAYER
LISTENING TO THAT AND WITH ME IN THE STUDIO IS THE KIND OF AND THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED MIGHTILY TO GET INTERESTED IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TOM STEVENSON DIRECTOR AT THE GIANT AMERICAN FUND FOR DEALT INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GUESS TODAY TOM THE MAN FROM THE AIR WAS RIGHT AS IN THE BIG INVESTORS LIKE YOUR FUND MEAD CERTAINTY OF RETURN BEFORE THEY'RE GOING TO PUT THE MONEY UP
WELL YES I MEAN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IS IS VERY ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS PARTICULARLY IN THE IN THE LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT ALREADY THIS MORNING INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO STAY LOWER FOR LONGER AND IN THAT ENVIRONMENT INVESTORS ARE ATTRACTED TO THE THE HIGHER RETURNS THAT YOU CAN GET FOR TYING UP YOUR MONEY FOR A LONG TIME
BUT OF COURSE THAT IS A REWARD FOR THE LIQUIDITY IN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO TIE YOUR MONEY FOR A LONG TIME THEN IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE THAT YOU HAVE THE POLITICAL STABILITY THAT THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN RELY ON ACCESSING YOUR MONEY FURTHER DOWN THE TRACK CRITICS WOULD SAY THAT BIG FUNDS LIKE YOURS ONLY WANT TO PUT THEIR MONEY UP WITH GUARANTEED RETURN THEY DON'T WANNA TAKE ANY KIND OF RISK ON THESE THINGS
WELL I MEAN IF INVESTMENT IS CUT HIS IS A BALANCE BETWEEN RISK AND REWARD AND YOU IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE HIGHER RIFFS AND LIQUIDITY IS ONE OF THOSE FACE THEN YOU NEED TO BE REWARDED BY A HIGHER RETURN OTHER THE NEWS IN THE MARKETS YESTERDAY WE HAD A WE HAD A DEAL THE PURCHASE OF POUND THEY ARE BELOW COST RETAIL OR BY A SOUTH AFRICAN RIVAL
IT'S THIS THERE ARE SOME DEALS GOING ON THE MARK OF THE BRICKS AT VOTE HASN'T STILL THINGS COMPLETELY BUT THIS WAS REALLY A COMPANY WHICH PROBABLY DESERVE TO BE PUT OUT OF ITS MISERY
LISTED AT THREE THIRTY AND BOUGHT YESTERDAY FOR TWO POUNDS TWENTY YES THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT STEIN OFFERS A SCENE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE AFTER THE FALL IN IN POINT LANDS PRICE BUT I THINK THE CURRENCY EFFECT HERE IS IS WORTH WORTH CONSIDERING
THE SOUTH AFRICAN RAND HAS APPRECIATED AGAINST THE POUND RECENTLY SO AFTER THAT AFTER THE FALL IN THE POUND ASSETS IN THE U.K. LIKE LIKE PAN THEN SUDDENLY SEE MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THE OVERSEAS BUYERS AND OPPORTUNITY FOR FOREIGN BUYERS THANK YOU MUCH TOM STEVENSON OF FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL WELL PERHAPS NOT SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOREIGN BUYERS TODAY WE GET ONE OF THE FIRST PIECES OF EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE HOUSING MARKET AFTER THE REFERENDUM VOTE IT'S THE MONTHLY SURVEY BY MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS
IN THE PAST THIS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY GOOD BAROMETER OF THE HOUSING MARKET AND IT SHOWS AT LEVELS OF ACTIVITY TO ENQUIRIES FROM NEW BUYERS AGREED SALES FELL SHARPLY LAST MONTH SIMON REUBEN SINISTER CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE ROYAL SOME COULD YOU PUT SOME CONTEXT HOW SHARP IS THE DIP AND HOW FAR DO WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO FIND A SIMILAR LIBERAL OF ACTIVITY
CERTAINLY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS A QUITE UP QUITE A PULL BACK IN THE BYRE ENQUIRIES IT'S FAIR TO SAY ACTUALLY THIS IS PART OF A TREND IT REALLY BEGAN IN APRIL AND THAT REALLY FOLLOWS WHAT WAS QUITE A STRONG FIRST QUARTER YOU'LL RECALL LURKED IN FACT GEORGE OSBORNE WHO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER INTRODUCED A SURCHARGE ON PURCHASES HAVE SECOND HOMES AND BUY TO LET WHICH TOOK EFFECT FROM THE FIRST OF APRIL SO IT WAS A BIT OF A RUSH IN THE MARKETS IN THAT FIRST QUARTER IT BEGAN TO UNWIND IN APRIL
ON TOP OF THAT OBVIOUSLY THEN THE BUILD UP TO THE REFERENDUM IN THE SUBSEQUENT OUTCOME HAS COMPOUNDED THAT TRAIN YOU'VE SEEN HER FALL BACK IN BYRON ENQUIRIES AND ALSO ANOTHER RETREAT IN THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTIES COMING ONTO THE MARKET SO THEY'RE THAT SHORTFALL THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR AND FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW HE'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE AND MORE VISIBLE IT'S QUITE A STEEP FOR THEM TO ABOUT A THIRD
THE THE WEATHER SUNNY IN THE PROPORTION OF EITHER OF OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE REPORTING THAT THEY'RE SEEING
A DROP IN INTEREST OVER THE MUM TO IS CERTAINLY IT'S ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THIRTY FIVE PERCENT HIGHER THAN IT WAS THEN THEN IT'S ALL THERE SO THE PROPORTION WHO ARE SEEING A FALL IS THIRTY PERCENT GREATER THAN THE PETS ZOO DERICE YEAH EXACTLY WHAT DOES THIS MEAN DO YOU THINK FOR HOUSE PRICES HOUSE PRICES ARE STILL GOING UP AND QUITE A LOT OF MARKETS AREN'T THOSE HOUSE PRICES ARE STILL RISING IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ABSOLUTELY BUT THEY'RE RISING AT A SLOWER RATE AND IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FORWARD LOOKING INDICATORS THEY'RE SORT OF SUGGESTING
THAT WE WILL SEE A FLAT LINING OR A SLIGHT DIP OVER THE COMING MONTHS THAT REALLY IS NO BAD THING LET'S BE HONEST IN MANY OF THE HOT MARKETS AROUND THE U.K. PRICES HAVE RISEN VERY SHARPLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE KEY THING AS FAR AS I THINK YOU KNOW THE THE INDUSTRY'S CONCERNED SO I SAID TO KEITH AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SALE SIDE BECAUSE WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THE MARKET COMPLETELY DUMB UP BECAUSE THAT HAS RAMIFICATIONS NOT JUST FOR
INDIVIDUAL BUYERS AND SELLERS HAS RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE WIDER ECONOMY THERE ARE SCIENCE AT THE FINANCES AVAILABLE TO TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN WE TALK ABOUT LOW INTEREST RATE BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND
CONFIDENT PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT TAKING THAT BIG LEAP OF BUYING A NEW HOUSE ISN'T IT ABSOLUTELY UNCERTAINTY IS IS CERTAINLY NO FRIENDS OF THE MARKET I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE FINANCE IS THERE IF YOU GO BACK A COUPLE YOU'LL GO BACK TO THE CREDIT CRUNCH THE FINANCE WASN'T THERE TO SUPPORT TRANSACTIONS THIS TIME ROUND WE KNOW BANKS ABOUT THE CAPITALISED
LAST WEEK'S MEASURE FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS PROVIDING GREATER CAPACITY FOR LENDING BUT ULTIMATELY CONFIDENCE IS CRITICAL AND IF IT'S NOT THERE PEOPLE WON'T MAKE THOSE BIG PERFECT AND JUST VERY QUICKLY SIMON STILL AS A TWO SPEED MARK AT LONDON THE SOUTH EAST AND THE REST WELL I THINK ACTUALLY IF IT'S TOO SWEET MARKET THEIR LONDON BUT LONDON'S GOING INTO REVERSE LONDON HAD A SLOWER MARKET

# TIME NOW IS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND YOU'RE LISTENING TO THEIR RADIO FOUR WITH MICHELLE SAME AND JUSTIN WEBB AND KATHY CLUSTERS HERE WITH A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS THE PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY IS BEGINNING HER FIRST FULL DAY IN DOWNING STREET AND SHE CONTINUES TO FORM HER NEW CABINET SHE'S EXPECTED TO GIVE SEVERAL MORE WOMEN SENIOR ROLES AMONG HER FIRST APPOINTMENTS LAST NIGHT PHILIP HAMMOND REPLACED GEORGE OSBORNE AS CHANCELLOR AND BORIS JOHNSON BECAME FOREIGN SECRETARY
MISSUS MAY HAVE SPOKEN TO THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL AND FRANCE'S PRESIDENT FRANCOIS LONGED AND TOLD THEM THAT BRITAIN NEEDS MORE TIME BEFORE STARTING NEGOTIATIONS TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION JEAN CLAUDE YOUNGER HAS URGED THE PRIME MINISTER TO START THE TALKS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
# THE BANK OF ENGLAND AS EXPECTED TO CUT INTEREST RATES TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE HEIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THEY'VE BEEN AT NOT POINT FIVE PER CENT SINCE MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
# PROPERTY SURVEYORS SAY THERE'S BEEN A NOTICEABLE DROP AN ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSING MARKET SINCE THE E.U. REFERENDUM A REPORT FROM THE SURVEYORS' ORGANISATION THE R. I C. S. SUGGEST SALES HAVE FALLEN SHARPLY ESPECIALLY IN LONDON AND THAT ENQUIRIES FROM NEW BUYERS ARE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY
# HUNGARY HAS REJECTED CLAIMS THAT IT'S POLICE AND SOLDIERS ARE USING EXCESSIVE FORCE TO EXPEL MIGRANTS TRYING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY FROM SERBIA HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH SAYS MIGRANTS ARE BEING BEATEN AND FORCED ACROSS THE BORDER A U.S. COURT HAS SENTENCED A CHINESE BUSINESSMEN TO NEARLY FOUR YEARS IN PRISON FOR CONSPIRING TO HACK INTO THEIR COMPUTER NETWORKS OF AMERICAN DEFENCE CONTRACTORS ZUBIN HAD ADMITTED TAKING PART IN A SCHEME TO HELP CHINESE MILITARY OFFICERS OBTAINED SENSITIVE INFORMATION

# REMARKABLE DISCOVERIES ABOUT LIFE IN BRONZE AGE BRITAIN HAD BEEN UNVEILED FOLLOWING A TEN MONTH ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE THE SITE NEAR PETERBOROUGH DATES BACK TO AROUND ONE THOUSAND B.C.
# THANK YOU HE'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND THERESA MAY HAS ONLY GIVEN US A HANDFUL OF CABINET APPOINTMENTS BUT IT IS QUITE A HANDFUL AND OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE TO COME TODAY NORMAN SMITH A SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR IS ON THE LINE AND LET'S START WITH BORIS JOHNSON NORMAN AND I MEAN I SUPPOSE THE QUESTION IS SUBSTANCE OR SHOWBIZ OR INDEED DEBATE I THINK A BIT OF BOTH
THE MOST STRIKING THING IS THE SHEER STUNNING SURPRISE OF MISSUS MAY'S DECISION TO BRING BACK BORIS JOHNSON A MAN WHOSE CAREER SEEMED PRETTY MUCH OVER AND TO GIVE HIM
ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR OFFICERS OF STATE BUT I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME PART OF A PACKAGE OF A MUCH BIGGER BOLDER BRASHER RESHUFFLE THAN ANYONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED AND BELIES MISSUS MAY'S IMAGES A RATHER CAUTIOUS CAREFUL POLITICIAN AND THE CLEAR INTENT WAS TO SEND OUT A MESSAGE OF CHANGE ALL CHANGE
AND SO IN THE SPACE OF WHAT A COUPLE OF HOURS WE IN EFFECT SAW THE DISMANTLING OF THE CAMERON CABINET SYMBOLICALLY WITH THEIR SACKING SACKING OF GEORGE OSBORNE BORIS JOHNSON HAS AS WE'VE MENTIONED A MAN WORTH NOTING WHO HAS NEVER HELD
ANY MINISTERIAL POSITION A MAN AND NOT NECESSARILY ASSOCIATED WITH DIPLOMACY OR TACKED BETWEEN NOW MOVES INTO THE FOREIGN OFFICE BRINGING BACK TO POLITICAL VETERANS LIAM FOX AND DAVID DAVIES WHO MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THERE
THE BEST DAYS WERE BEHIND THEM CREATING IN THE PROCESS TO ENTIRELY NEW GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT FOR EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TO DATE ONLY ONE CABINET MINISTER IS CLINGING ON TO THE SAME POST
AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF UPHEAVAL IN THE SPACE OF TWO HOURS AND AS I SAY MEANT TO SIGNAL A CLEAR DECISIVE BREAK WITH THE CAMERONIANS BROTHER WOMEN OR THE ONLY FEMALE APPOINTMENT SO FAR AS AMBER RUDD TO HOME SECRETARY BUT I THINK THAT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE WE WERE PROMISED A SIGNIFICANT PROMOTION FOR WOMEN THE OTHER
THING WHICH HASN'T HAPPENED SO FAR WHICH AGAIN WE SEEM TO BE ON COURSE FOR WAS A. MORE ONE NATION APPROACH BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S LOOKING TO ME LIKE A. FIVE FAIRLY HARD EDGED
BUT THE OTHER THING WHICH I THINK IS WORTH SAYING JUSTIN IS THE WAY MISSUS MAY HAS GIVEN BREAKS IT TO THE BRAKES ARE TEARS IT IS STRIKING THAT ALL THE BRECK SIT FACING POSITIONS WHETHER IT'S FOREIGN SECRETARY
BORIS JOHNSON WHETHER IT'S INTERNATIONAL TRADE FORGING THE NEW TRADE DEALS WITH LIAM FOX AND THE BRAKES AT MINISTER DAVID DAVIES ALL GO TO HARDLINE COMMITTED BREAKS HER TEARS AND IN PART OBVIOUSLY THAT IS THE THINKING IS TO GIVE BREAKS AT THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN IT AND WANT TO MAKE IT WORK IN PART IT'S REASSURANCE BUT I THINK ALSO THERE'S A HARD HEADED CALCULATION
BUT ALL THIS GOES WRONG MORE OF DIFFICULT DEALS HAVE TO BE DONE FROM MISERS REACH THEN BACKBENCHERS KICK UP MISSUS MAY CAN TURN ROUND TO THEM SAY DON'T BLAME ME BECAUSE IT'S THE BRAKES ARE TEARS WHO ARE RUNNING BRECK'S IT THOROUGHLY INTERESTING THOUGHT THAT ISN'T IT THAT ACTUALLY THIS COULD BE DIFFICULT AND THERE WILL BE COMPROMISES TO BE MADE AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMEONE OUT THERE MAKING THERE'S COMPROMISES SELLING THEM TO THE RIGHT OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THEN WELL DAVID DAVIS PROBABLY MOUNTED IT OUT BUT SHE HAS I THINK SHORT CIRCUIT IT
THE POTENTIAL FOR ENDLESS BACKBENCH GRIEF BECAUSE THERE'S NO DOUBT ALREADY THERE IS DEEP APPREHENSION AMONGST BREAKS OF TEARS ABOUT THE APPROACH TO ENDING FREE MOVEMENT BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE COMING OUT FROM TEA MAY IS ALL ABOUT CONTROLLING FREE MOVEMENT WHICH IS NOT AT ALL THE SAME AS ENDING IT SIMILARLY THERE BEEN A HUGE FOCUS ON TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF DEAL WITH THE SINGLE MARKET WHEN MANY BREAKS AT IS BASICALLY DON'T THINK WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE SINGLE MARKET SO YOU CAN SEE
# THERE ARE GOING TO BE COMPROMISES THERE ARE GOING TO BE DEALS AND THE TIMESCALE ALSO MAY TAKE AN AWFUL LOT LONGER SO WHY NOT LEAVE THAT TO THE BRAKES ARE TEARS THEMSELVES TO SORT OUT NORMAN THANKS A LOT MORE ON THIS COURSE DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME INCLUDING PHILIP HAMMOND THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER TEN PAST THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN WE WILL HEAR AT MIDDAY FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND ON WHETHER THERE IS TO BE AN INTEREST RATE CUT ANDREW VENICE VERITY ARE ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS ANDY
WELL THE CITY IT IS GIVING AN EIGHTY PERCENT PROBABILITY MICHELLE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF A CUT IN INTEREST RATES IT DAY THE EXPECTATION OF THE CITY IS IT WILL BE A QUARTER QUITE CUT RATHER THAN THE HALF POINT CUT BUT THERE ARE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE URGING THE BANKS SHOULD GO FURTHER IT'S IRONIC HERE WHEN THE RATE WAS CUT TO ITS LOWEST IN THREE HUNDRED YEARS BACK IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND NINE MERVYN KING SAID IT SUPPOSED TO BE AN EMERGENCY MEASURE
AND THAT HE HOPED THAT THEY WOULD GO BACK OUT SCENE SO STATUS CAN MAKE A BIT OF A RETURN ON THEIR MONEY AND HERE WE ARE SEVEN YEARS LATER WE'VE HAD EIGHTY SEVEN DECISIONS OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE AND IN ALMOST ALL OF THOSE DECISIONS THE EXPECTATION HAS BEEN THAT RATES AT SOME POINT WILL GO UP SING ABOUT TEN MONTHS AGO THERE WERE SOME VERY INTERESTING REMARKS BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S CHIEF ECONOMIST ANDY HOW PLAIN
WHO SAID THAT HE THOUGHT MAYBE THE NEXT MOVE IN RATES SHOULD BE DOWN IN OF COURSE THAT NOW LOOKS QUITE PRESTIGE BUT HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT EMERGING MARKETS RIGHT NOW LOOKS LIKE THE EMERGING MARKETS ARE WORRIED ABOUT US SO IF THEY DO CUT RATES AND DOES THAT MEAN THAT IT IS A SIGNAL THAT THEIR EXPECTATION IS THAT A RECESSION IS AROUND THE CORNER
VERY MUCH SO MY CHALET I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO FIND YOU HAVE TO LOOK HARD TO FIND A JUSTIFICATION FOR CUTTING MATES OTHER THAN THAT AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THE UPSIDE WRIST TO INFLATION ARE ACTUALLY QUITE STRONG HE'S HAD A BIG TEA VALUATION IN THE POUND WHICH MEANS OF COURSE THAT THE PRICES OF IMPORTED GOODS GO UP NO MATS TO BE AN UPWARD PRESSURE ON INFLATION
WE'VE HAD INFLATION BELOW TARGET NOW FOR THIRTEEN MONTHS SO THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GET IT BACK UP TO TWO PER CENT BUT ACTUALLY I THINK THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO WORRIED ABOUT TOO MUCH INFLATION AT THE MOMENT INFLATION THAT'S YOU DEAL WITH OUR DEBTS TO SOME EXTENT
AND IT'S SIMPLY A FISCAL POLICY IF THEY WERE TO BE SOME SORT OF FISCAL STIMULUS TO THE ECONOMY FISCAL POLICY IS COMPLETELY UP IN THE AIR WE NOW HAVE A SITUATION WITH CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED ON A PLATFORM OF AUSTERITY ENCLOSING THE BUDGET DEFICIT BY TWENTY TWENTY BUT THE OUTGOING CHANCELLOR ALREADY DUMPER IDEA AN INCOMING CHANCELLOR PHILIP HAMMOND WHO WAS YOUR FAVOURITE IT'S WELL HIS BOSS ISN'T SO THERE ARE A LOT OF PREDICTIONS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME SORT OF FISCAL STIMULUS IN ADDITION TO THE MONETARY STIMULUS WERE EXPECTING TODAY
# ANDY VERITY THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THERESA MAY'S FIRST HOURS AND GOVERNMENT STAREY CAMERAS LAST DOMINATE THE FRONT AS WELL AS THE INSIDE PAGES AS YOU'D EXPECT THE TIMES TALK TO MISSUS MACE CLEAN BREAK AS SHE CAST OUT THE LONGSTANDING CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE AND ONE OF THE GREAT OFFICES OF STATE TO BORIS JOHNSON THE GUARDIAN THINKS THAT THE NEW PRIME MINISTER MADE A SPEECH TO THE MIDDLE GROUND ON THE STEPS OF NUMBER TEN BUT THEN CHOSE A CABINET WHICH TOOK A TILT TO THE RIGHT IT SAYS
HER LANGUAGE WAS CENTRIST AND CONCILIATORY HER FIRST APPOINTMENT'S PUT VETERAN RIGHT WINGERS DAVID DAVIS AND LIAM FOX BACK IN GOVERNED THE DAILY TELEGRAPH BILLY'S MISSUS MAY HAS REACHED OUT TO BRECHT'S OR TEARS AND AN ATTEMPT TO RESHAPE BRITAIN'S ROLE IN THE WORLD THE FINANCIAL TIMES TALKS OF THERESA MAY SWEEPING INTO DOWNING STREET WITH PHILIP HAMMOND AS CHANCELLOR THE DAILY EXPRESS THINKS OF THE RESHUFFLE IS A SIGNAL OF MISSUS MADE MISSUS MAY'S DETERMINATION TO SHOW THAT BREAKS IT MEANS BRECHT'S IT
THE DAILY MAIL SAYS BEARING IN MIND THIS IS MAY WAS IT REMAIN AS SHE'S MADE A CLEVER AND ENCOURAGING SET OF BRECHT'S A TEAR APPOINTMENTS THE SUN HAS A PICTURE OF THE CAMERONS OUTSIDE DOWNING STREET AND IT'S FRONT PAGE GO WITH THE FLOW IT'S THE HEADLINERS IT DESCRIBES HOW DAVID CAMERON WAS UPSTAGED BY HIS GIGGLING THE FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER FLORENCE THE DAILY MAIL AGREES THE LITTLE GIRL WHO WASN'T IN BOURNE AND HER FATHER HELD HIS FIRST CABINET MEETING AT NUMBER TEN WAS THE STAR OF THE SHOW IN THE DAILY MIRROR DESCRIBES HOW MISTER CAMERON'S ELDER DAUGHTER NANCY HAD TO BE GIVEN A CONSOLING HUG BY HER DAD AS HER LIP QUIVERED
# THE PAPERS PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO BORIS JOHNSON'S APPOINTMENT AS FOREIGN SECRETARY THE TIMES WEIGHTS NO LONGER THAN PARAGRAPH THREE OF ITS FRONT PAGE TO GIVE DETAILS OF HIS OUTSPOKEN COMMENTS INCLUDING THE MOMENT WHEN HE COMPARED HILLARY CLINTON TO A SADISTIC NURSE INSIDE IT CONTINUES THE LIST OF GAS WITH A REMINDER THAT HE FLATTENED HER TEN YEAR OLD BOY WELL PLAYED RUGBY ON A TRADE VISIT TO JAPAN AND APOLOGISE TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA FOR LINKING IT TO CANNIBALISM AND CHIEF KILLING THE EYE HAS A SIMILAR LISTEN ASK SO WHY IS HE FOREIGN SECRETARY
BECAUSE THE EYE SAYS HE'S A PROMINENT LEAVER WHO'S HAD AMPLE PRACTICE REPRESENTING LONDON ON THE WORLD STAGE AND COMMANDS LIGHTENING FAST MASTERY OF A DETAILED BRIEF LAZARUS SLIGHT BORIS JOHNSON HAS COME BACK FROM THE POLITICAL DEAD RIGHTS ANDREW PIERCE IN THE DAILY MAIL HE SAYS THAT BORIS WAS BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED AT THE FAILURE OF HIS BID TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER HE COULD HARDLY HAVE IMAGINED IT WOULD BE WAKING UP TODAY AS FOREIGN SECRETARY IN THE MIRROR BELIEVES THAT GLITTERING PRIZE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A MAN WHO WAS SACKED TWICE FOR LYING
# AS TO INSULT AT MOST OF THE WORLD AT SOME POINT AND THE PAPER SAYS DECEIVE THE ELECTORATE OVER BRICKS AND OWEN SAID SENTRY IS A THIRD CANDIDATE IN THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP CONTEST APPEARS AND MOST OF THE PAPERS THE TIME SAYS HE'S TRYING TO SELL HIMSELF AS A UNITY LEADER BUT MODERATES THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF A SINGLE CANDIDATE STOOD AGAINST JEREMY CORBIN THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS THAT LABOUR M.P.S ARE SPLIT ON WHO WAS THE BETTER CANDIDATE BETWEEN MISTER SMITH AND ANGELA EAGLE
# TIMES EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING IS THERESA MAY IS GOING TO MAKE MORE APPOINTMENTS TO HER MINISTERIAL TEAM ON HER FIRST FULL DAY IN DOWNING STREET DAVID CAMERON'S LAST SESSION OF PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS YESTERDAY WAS A BRAVURA PERFORMANCE WITH THE MONTY PYTHON JOKE PHOTOGRAPH OF LARRY THE CAT AND A POSSIBLE AMERICAN ACCENT A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT ALICIA MCCARTHY WAS WATCHING
EM PEAS SAT IN THE AISLES CRAMMED INTO THE UPSTAIRS GALLERIES AND STOOD FIVE DEEP AT THE BACK OF THE CHAMBER TO WATCH DAVID CAMERON'S FINAL APPEARANCE AT PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS AFTER SIX YEARS AT NUMBER TEN
A TIME TO LOOK BACK AT HIS ACHIEVEMENTS OR AS LABOUR'S GEOFF SMITH PUT IT THE PRIME MINISTER CAME TO OFFICE PROMISING TO KEEP THE U.K.'S TRIPLE A. RATING
AND TOP DOWN N.H.S. REORGANISATIONS AND TO STOP HIS PARTY BANGING ON ABOUT
HALF IN THE PUBLIC GALLERY SAT SAMANTHA CAMERON AND THEIR CHILDREN THEIR ELDEST DAUGHTER WAVED THE PRIME MINISTER A RELAXED AND CONFIDENT REELED OFF A LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS MORE JOBS MORE APPRENTICESHIPS MORE MONEY FOR ENGLAND N. H. S. AND A CUT IN THE DEFICIT AND ONE MORE THING THERE WERE THIRTY THOUSAND GAY PEOPLE HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET MARRIED THEN I THINK THAT IS REAL PROGRESS
NEVER FORGET THE DAY ACTUALLY IN NUMBER TEN WHEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED VERY CLOSE TO THE FRONT DOOR SAID TO ME I'M NOT THAT IT EXTREME POLITICS MY CAMERON BUT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOUR LOT HAVE DONE I'M ABLE TO MARRY THE PERSON I'VE LOVED ALL MY LIFE THIS WEEKEND AND THAT WAS THERE ARE MANY AMAZING MOMENTS IN THIS JOB THAT CHURCH IT WAS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE IF THAT WAS ONE OF DAVID CAMERON'S FONDEST MEMORIES HOW WOULD HIS M. PEAS REMEMBER HIM THERE WAS HIGH PRAISE FROM THE VETERAN BACKBENCHER PETER LILLEY
THIRTY THREE YEARS IN THIS HOUSE WATCHING FIVE PRIME MINISTERS AND SEVERAL EX PRIME MINISTERS I SEEN HIM ACHIEVING MASTERY OF THAT
MY TIME DAVID CAMERON RECKONED THAT FOR ALL ITS THEATRICS P.M.Q.S DID HAVE A PURPOSE AND ATTRACTED ADMIRERS AROUND THE WORLD AS HE DISCOVERED ON A TRIP TO NEW YORK TO MEET THE THEN MAYOR MIKE BLOOMBERG
WE WALK DOWN THE STREET AND EVERYONE KNEW MIKE BLOOMBERG AND EVERYONE CAME UP AND SAID YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB NO ONE HAD A CLUE WHO I WASN'T EVENTUALLY SOMEONE SAID HEY CAMERON PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS WE LOVE YOUR SHOW
SOMEONE WHO WASN'T ENJOYING THE SHOW WAS THE S. M. PEAS WESTMINSTER LEADER ANGUS ROBERTSON HE TOLD DAVID CAMERON HE'D BE REMEMBERED FOR TAKING THE U.K. OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
WHAT ADVICE HAS HE GIVEN HIS SUCCESSOR ON TAKING SCOTLAND OUT OF THE E. U. AGAINST THE WISHES OF SCOTTISH VOTERS
DAVID CAMERON CALLED THERESA MAY A BRILLIANT NEGOTIATOR AND SAID HIS ADVICE WAS YOU KATE SHOULD BE AS CLOSE TO THE E.U. AS IT COULD THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN QUOTED THERESA MAY'S REMARKS THAT THE ECONOMY SHOULD WORK FOR EVERYONE ISN'T SHE RIGHT THERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN TOO MANY PLACES IN BRITAIN FOR YOU
THEIR ECONOMY HAS BEEN DESTROYED IN TOWNS THERE IN BECAUSE THE INDUSTRIES HAVE GONE THERE ARE LEVELS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT OR UNDER EMPLOYMENT AND A DEEP SENSE OF MALAY
DAVID CAMERON REPEATED HIS LIST OF HIS GOVERNMENT'S ACHIEVEMENTS AS TO JEREMY CORBIN'S ACCUSATIONS OF INACTION LET'S JUST TAKE THE LAST WEEK WE BOTH HAVE BEEN HAVING THESE LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS WE GOT ON WITH IT WE'VE HAD RESIGNATION NOMINATION COMPETITION AND CORONATION THEY HAVEN'T EVEN DECIDED WHAT THE RULES ARE
JEREMY CORBIN BRUSH THAT ASIDE DEMOCRACY IS AN EXCITING AND SPLENDID THING AND I MEAN
AS CONSERVATIVE M.P.S CHEERED AND BROADS DAVID CAMERON RECKONED MISTER CORBIN WAS NOT SO MUCH THE KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOUR IN THE BATTLE FOR DEMOCRACY MORE THE BLACK KNIGHT IN MONTY PYTHON'S HOLY
MANY TIMES BUT HE SAYS KEEP GOING IT'S ONLY A FLESH WOUND
AT A PREVIOUS P.M.Q.S DAVID CAMERON HAD OFFERED HIS MOTHER'S ADVICE TO JEREMY CORBIN SAYING SHE TELL HIM TO BASICALLY TIDY HIMSELF UP A BIT AND SING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM JEREMY CORBIN WAS GRATEFUL FOR HER ADVICE ABOUT TIES IN SUITS
THE LABOUR LEADERS FINAL QUESTION TO DAVID CAMERON WAS ABOUT A RUMOUR GOING AROUND THAT HIS DEPARTURE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED SO HE CAN SLIP SEAMLESSLY INTO THE VACANCY CREATED THIS MORNING ON STRICTLY BY LEN GOODMAN'S DEPARTURE IS THAT IS NEXT
DAVID CAMERON ASSURED HIM THE STRICTLY RUMOUR WASN'T TRUE THEN HOLDING UP A PICTURE OF LARRY THE DOWNING STREET CAT DAVID CAMERON WANTED TO QUASH ONE LAST BIT OF GOSSIP BUT SOMEHOW I DON'T LOVE LARRY I DO AND I HAVE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
I CAN'T TAKE LARRY WITH ME HE BELONGS TO THE HOUSE AND THE STAFF LOVE HIM VERY MUCH AS DO I. THE VETERAN CONSERVATIVE KEN CLARKE WAS THE LAST TO BE CALLED HE THANK DAVID CAMERON FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ELOQUENCE WIT AND HUMOUR AND URGED HIM NOT TO TURN HIS BACK ON THE COMMONS AS NO TWO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT REX IT MEANS AT THE MOMENT WE NEED HIS ADVICE AND YOU STATESMANSHIP AS MUCH AS WE ARE
DAVID CAMERON SAID HE'D MISSED P.M.Q.S BUT HE'D BE WILLING ON M.P.S FROM ALL SIDES THE LAST THING I'D SAY IS THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE
A LOT OF THINGS IN POLITICS YOU CAN GET A LOT OF THINGS DONE AND THAT IN THE END THE PUBLIC SERVICE THE NATIONAL INTEREST THAT IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
NOTHING IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO IT AFTER ALL AS I WANT SAID I WAS THE FUTURE ONCE
TORY M.P.S ROARED RISING TO THEIR FEET FOR A STANDING OVATION JOINED BY FORMER LIB DEM LEADER NICK CLEGG AND SOME LABOUR M.P.S DAVID CAMERON SMILED AND WAVED TO HIS FAMILY IN THE GALLERY AND LEFT THE FRONT BENCH FOR THE LAST TIME
# ALICIA MCCARTHY AND THERE'S MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AT HOPPER STATE ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND DIGITAL RADIO THE TIDE IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN A FEW MONTHS AGO ARCHAEOLOGISTS IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE SAID THAT I'M THERE TO UNCOVERED BRITAIN'S POMPEII THERE DISCOVERED THE BEST PRESERVED BRONZE AGE DWELLINGS EVER FOUND IN THIS COUNTRY WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THEIR FINDINGS THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE LAST TEN MONTHS THEY ARE OPENED UP TODAY AND ARE REPORTED TO MUFFET IS THERE NOW MORNING TIM
YES GOOD MORNING TO YOU I'M STANDING ON THE EDGE OF A CLAY QUARRY ABOUT FOUR MILES EAST OF PETERBOROUGH AND A FEW YEARS AGO BULLDOZERS UNVEILED WHAT SEEM TO BE UNUSUAL PIECES OF TIMBER TESTS WERE DONE FAST FORWARD TO TODAY AND THE CULMINATION OF A TEN MONTH EXCAVATION PROJECT ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS NOTHING LIKE NOTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE IT'S THOUGHT FIVE WOODEN HOUSES ON STILTS
ONCE STOOD ON THIS SITE A FIRE CAUSED THEM TO COLLAPSE AND THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE TIMBER FELL INTO THE WATER BUT THAT PRESERVED THEM IN REMARKABLE DETAIL IT IS IN EFFECT A SNAPSHOT OF LIFE THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO DEBORAH PRETTY IS THE INSPECTOR OF ANCIENT MONUMENTS FOR HISTORIC AND DEBORAH HOW BIG A DEAL IS THIS
WELL IT'S JUST FANTASTIC BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST PRESERVED BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT THAT'S EVER BEEN DISCOVERED IN THIS COUNTRY AS YOU'VE SAID WE'VE GOT PART OF A SETTLEMENT HERE AND PROTECTED BY A PALACE WITH FIVE HOUSES BUILT ON STILTS JUTTING OUT INTO THE WATER
THEY SAID THE FIRE AND THE FACT THAT THE WHOLE SITE FELL INTO THE WATER MAKE MEANS WE'VE GOT ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC PRESERVATION SO NOT JUST THE POTTERY IN THE METALWORK SURVIVES BUT ALL THE THINGS LIKE TEXTILES AND THAT I NEED AND DO THE TIMBER STRUCTURES THEMSELVES
ARE ALL IN FANTASTIC CONDITION IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT LIFE IN THE BRONZE AGE THIS LITTLE TRINKETS TWEEZERS POTS BUCKETS PLATTERS DECORATIVE TEXTILES LOOMS AND WHAT HAVE WE LEARNT ABOUT LIFE THREE THOUSAND YEARS
WHAT THE SHUT SITE SHOWS US IS THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE RELISHING LIVING IN THIS LANDSCAPE THERE ALTHOUGH THEY'VE CHOSEN TO LIVE BY THE WATER AND WE THINK THAT'S A DELIBERATE CHOICE BECAUSE IT GIVES THEM VERY EASY ACCESS ALONG THE WATERWAYS THAT THROUGH THE FENS AND MAYBE AND MAYBE ACROSS THE NORTH SEA INTO EUROPE
BUT THEY'RE ALSO EXPLOITING A HIGHLY MANAGED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE SO THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS COMFORTABLE COMFORTABLE LIFE ABOUT FOR BRONZE AGE POINT OF VIEW HOW CAN YOU BE SO CERTAIN THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY FROM THE
WELL THERE ARE SCIENTIFIC SCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUES WHAT WHICH ONE CAN USE ON THE ORGANIC MATERIALS THINGS LIKE CARBON FOURTEEN DATING BUT FASHION IS PUNISH FASHION IS NOT A NEW THING IN THE BRONZE AGE THERE'S THEY'RE BOTH TECHNOLOGICAL AND ARTISTIC DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MEAN THAT WE CAN WE CAN DATE THINGS LIKE POTTERY AND METALWORK FROM FROM THE STYLES ARE DIFFERENT STYLES WHICH EVOLVED THROUGH TIME AND SOME OF THE
FINEST TEXTILES HAVE BEEN FOUND AS WELL HAVEN'T THEY THAT'S RIGHT IN THE TEXTILES ARE REALLY EXCITING IN THE MANGE MADE FROM PLANT FIBRES SO WE'VE GOT FLAT FLAX HAVE GOT YOUR FINE LINEN AND THEN FABRICS MADE FROM NETTLES AND ALSO LINE BELFAST
LOOKING ROUND WHERE WE ARE STANDING RIGHT AT THE MOMENT THESE ARE ANCIENT TIMBERS AREN'T THEY
THEY LOOK UNREMARKABLE BUT THE STORY BEHIND THE SITE IS JUST MIND BOGGLING TO THINK THAT WHERE WE ARE STANDING NOW THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO THIS PROSPEROUS SETTLEMENT WITHOUT WENT SUDDENLY FIRE TOOK IT AWAY ABSOLUTELY WE STILL WE'RE STILL WORKING ON ONE WE KNOW QUITE WHY THE WHY THE FIRE HAPPEN WE DON'T QUITE KNOW BUT IT WAS IMMEDIATE AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT NO EVIDENCE OF FATALITIES
CLEARLY PEOPLE DIDN'T APPEAR TO HAVE STOPPED AND TAKEN THINGS WITH THEM BUT IT HAS LEFT US WITH THIS FANTASTIC PICTURE OF WHAT THAT THAN THEY WALKED AWAY
AND LEFT EVERYTHING HERE WE HAVE FOR YOU A LIVING KIT FOR THE BRONZE AGE FOR US ALL TO UNDERSTAND AND SEE THE POMPEII OF THE FENS I'VE HEARD IT DESCRIBED DEBORAH THANKS EVER SO MUCH THERE'S LOTS OF INFORMATION STILL TO BE GLEANED FROM THIS SITE AS LAID UNDISTURBED FOR THREE THOUSAND YEARS BUT THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING AND REASSESSING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BRONZE AGE HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN
# THANK VERY MUCH TIME EIGHT MINUTES TO SET THE CALLS FROM WORLD LEADERS THE BRIEFINGS THE NUCLEAR CODES WHAT ARE LIKELY TO BE THE PROTOCOLS AND PRACTICALITIES OF THERESA MAY'S FIRST FULL DAY AS PRIME MINISTER EVEN FOR SOMEONE A CUSTOM TO RUNNING ONE OF THE GREAT OFFICES OF STATE THERE WILL BE MUCH TO TAKE IN
DOCTOR KATHERINE HADDEN HIS CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORIAN AT THE INSTITUTE FOR GOVERNMENT AND INDEPENDENT THINK TANK PROMOTING MORE EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT AND SHE'S WITH US GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT HAPPENS ON A NEW PRIME MINISTER'S FIRST DAY DOWNING STREET IT'S VERY DIFFERENT SHEET THAT'S HOME SECRETARY SHE'S VERY EXPERIENCED IN A LOT OF MATTERS OF GOVERNMENT ON SHE'S ON NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SHE'S CHAIRED COBRA
SHE'S VERY FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF THE OFFICIALS BUT IT'S STILL A CEREMONIAL ROLE A LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY IS QUITE DIFFERENT FOR BEING PRIME MINISTER WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST DIFFERENT IS IT IS IT THE NUCLEAR CODES WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE NEW PRIME MINISTER HAVING A FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR BOTTOMS NOT ACTUALLY
QUITE CORRECT NO WE DON'T HAVE A BUTTON WE DON'T HAVE A THE FOOTBALL THEY'RE CODES THAT CARRIED ROUND LUCKY U.S. PRESIDENT BE YEAH IT'S A LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY
AND ALSO SOME RESPONSIBILITY REALLY THAT YOU CAN'T GET IN ANY OTHER JOB SEE WILL BE BRIEFED BY THE CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE STAFF ON EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE TRIDENT SUBMARINE CAN DO THAT IN ITSELF LEFT TONY BLAIR QUITE QUIET SO REPORTS TOLD US AS SHOULD THEN WE ASKED TO WRITE SOME LETTERS
THESE THEY DON'T DO THEM IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY THEY GO TO EACH OF THE SUBMARINES ARE HAND WRITTEN LOVE LETTERS THAT ARE THEN LOCKED IN A SAFE HOPEFULLY NEVER OPENED NEVER USED AND THEY'RE BASICALLY LETTERS OF LAST RESORT IF THE ENTIRETY OF THE U.K. WAS DESTROYED WATCH AT THAT SUBMARINE DO ANTS AND DAVID CAMERON'S LETTERS WILL BE DESTROYED AT THAT POINT THEY WILL BE AND SHE ALSO HAS TO APPOINT SOME NUCLEAR DEPUTIES THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
SO THE GAME THIS IS A TRADITION FROM FROM THE COLD WAR THE IDEA IS THAT IF THE PRIME MINISTER WAS INCAPACITATED IN SOME WAY WHO WOULD SHE WANT TO HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT
NOT REVEALED IN ANYWHERE WE DON'T KNOW WE KNOW ONE OF THEM WHICH WAS DENIS HEALEY BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES BUT APART FROM THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHEN THE ROUND WITH THE REST OF THE CABINET NO I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW IT'S ONE OF THOSE SORT OF VERY CLOSELY HELD SECRETS I GUESS THEY WOULD KNOW IF IT WASN'T THEM AND THEY WOULD KNOW IF IT WAS THERE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WINE OFFICEY LIGHTS HAVE BEEN MY DAVID CAMERON'S TIME THE CALLS FROM WORLD LEADERS SHE'S TAKEN SOME OF THEM ALREADY
NOT SURE IF WE KNOW YET IF SHE'S TAKEN THE CALL FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA WHAT WOULD COME PRETTY EARLY ON WE HAVE SEEN TWEETS FROM VARIOUS WORLD LEADERS IT MAY BE THAT THEY FOLLOWED UP THEIR CONVERSATIONS IT'S USUALLY EXPECTED THAT THESE PHONE CALLS START TO COME IN FROM PRETTY SOON AFTER THE APPOINTMENT IT'S IT'S WELL ORGANISED BY VARIOUS OFFICIALS ON EITHER SIDE YOU LARGELY FORMAL SORT OF CONGRATULATIONS I THINK WE SAID WE'VE HEARD SHE'S ALREADY SPOKEN TO A FEW EUROPEAN LEADERS AS WELL
AGAIN TALKING ABOUT IN GENERAL TERMS WHAT WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO YOU KNOW BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MY CASES LIKE ANGELA MERKEL WE KNOW THAT SHE SHE WANTS BRITAIN TO GET ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF OF ARTICLE FIFTY SO FUN IMAGINE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT MORE THAN JUST THERE
BASIC CONGRATULATIONS THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND SHE WILL HAVE KNOWN SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ALREADY BUT USUALLY THERE'S SO MANY PHONE CALLS TO GO THROUGH OBVIOUSLY SHE WAS BUSY RESHUFFLING HER CABINET LAST OR SHUFFLING HER CABINET SHALL WE SAY FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST NIGHT SO A LOT OF THE PHONE CALLS WON'T BE THE KIND OF DEPTH THAT SHE'LL BE WANTING TO GET IN THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SAID A FEW WORDS AND LIKEWISE THEY WOULD'VE DONE ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE AND SO FORTH AND ADD SOME OF THAT IS TO ALLOW THEM TO THEN PUT OUT STATEMENTS LIKE THE ONES WE'VE HAD THIS MORNING SAYING THAT
SHE'S ASKED THEM TO RESPECT THE TIME THAT THE U.K. NEEDS AND SHE SHE ALSO NEEDS TO GET IN ALL OF HER STAFF IN PLACE AND SHE SHE HAS A LOT LESS TIME NOW THEN WHEN SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO TO PREPARE FOR FOR BEGINNING WORK IN NUMBER TEN THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN SHE WILL HAVE HER OWN ADVISERS FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE AS FOR ON THE HOME OFFICE HOME OFFICE EVEN THAT SHE WILL HAVE TAKEN OVER WITH HER I SUSPECT THERE'S A MIXTURE THOUGH AT NUMBER TEN OBVIOUSLY DAVID CAMERA WOULD HAVE HAD A LOT OF SPECIAL ADVISERS WHO WOULD HAVE LEFT THE JOB WITH HIM
BUT THERE'S MANY OTHER OFFICIALS THERE WHO WOULD HAVE CONTINUED IN ROLL SHALL RE SHAPE NUMBER TEN I THINK IN HER OWN IMAGE BUT IT MIGHT TAKE HER SOMETIMES SHE MIGHT KEEP ASPECTS OF HOW CAMERON HAD ORGANISED IT BUT SHE MIGHT WANT TO AMEND IT IN VARIOUS WAYS TO SORT OF FIT WITH HER WORKING PRACTISES HER STYLE OF HOW SHE WANTS TO GOVERN
# DOCTOR CATHERINE HADDEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR THE WEATHER HAIRS PHILIP FAVOURING ON AGAIN FELT JUSTIN VERY GOOD MORNING TO JUST TWEETED A PICTURE ONTO THE B. B. C. TWITTER ACCOUNTS OF THE IMAGE THE LATEST SATELLITE IMAGE FROM ACROSS THE BRITISH ISLES AND IT SHOWS THE SCALE OF THE CLOUD AT THE MOMENT AND I'M NOT PUTTING THAT THEY'RE THERE FOR FOR ANY BAD REASON IT'S THERE TO SHOW YOU THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY ALMOST GOT A SUMMER'S DAY ON OUR HANDS SO BE WARNED HE WON'T BE USED TO THAT SO FAR THIS SUMMER
WE'VE GOT ONE OR TWO SHOWERS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES AT THE MOMENTS ONE OR TWO ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF WALES ONE OR TWO INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND THE ODD ONE IN THE SOUTH EAST AS WELL BUT ESSENTIALLY IT'S A DRY AND A GLORIOUS MORNING AND THAT'S THE WAY IT STAYS FOR MANY WHO FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY YES THE CLOUD WILL BUILD UP A LITTLE BIT IN PLACES AROUND ABOUT LUNCHTIME THEN TEND TO FADE IN SOME AREAS DURING THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON
I THINK WE WILL KEEP A LITTLE BIT MORE ACROSS THE EASTERN COUNTIES AND THERE WILL BE THE OCCASIONAL LIGHT SHALL WE GO BUT NOT WITH THE INTENSITY OR THE SCOPE THAT WE'VE HAD IN RECENT DAYS AND WEEKS A GLORIOUS DAY IN PROSPECT FOR MANY OF YOU TEMPERATURES AND ARRANGE A SIXTEEN TO TWENTY ONE A STYLE A BIT BELOW PAR AFTER WHAT HAS BEEN QUITE A CHILLY START TO THE DAY

THERESA MAY EXPLAIN TO EUROPE'S MOST IMPORTANT TWO LEADERS HER GOVERNMENT WOULD NEED SOME TIME TO PREPARE FOR ITS EXIT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE E.U. THE MISSUS MAY HAS CRACKED ON QUICKLY WITH SWEEPING OUT DAVID CAMERON'S CABINET MOST STRIKINGLY IN HER SACKING OF GEORGE OSBORNE DESPITE TURNING THE ECONOMY AROUND MISTER OSBORNE PAID THE PRICE FOR WARNING OF THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES OF A VOTE TO LEAVE

# A LABOUR DONOR IS PLANNING A LEGAL CHALLENGE TO THE PARTY'S RULING THAT JEREMY CORBIN CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED IN THE LEADERSHIP BALLOT MICHAEL FOSTER WHOSE FAMILY GAVE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TO THE PARTY SAID HE WAS CONCERNED AT WHAT HE CALLED THE APPARENT MANIPULATION OF THE RULES BY LABOUR'S RULING BODY THE ANY SEA WILL BE TALKING TO MISTER FASTER AFTER THIS BULLETIN
# THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE ITS CUTTING INTEREST RATES TO A NEW RECORD LOW THEY'VE STOOD AT NOUGHT POINT FIVE PER CENT SINCE MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WHEN THE BANK ANNOUNCED WHAT IT CALLED AN EMERGENCY REDUCTION AT THE HEIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME AHMED HAS MORE DETAILS
WITH FEARS ARE GROWING THAT BRITAIN COULD BE FACING A RECESSION DUE TO UNCERTAINTY FOLLOWING THE REFERENDUM RESULT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE MORE STIMULUS TO THE ECONOMY THE BANK'S GOVERNOR MARK CARNEY HAS SIGNALLED THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE WHICH SETS INTEREST RATES IS POISED TO ACT
AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE MADE AT MID DAY ON WHAT COULD BE THE FIRST TO CHANGE IN THE RECORD LOW INTEREST RATE AT NOUGHT POINT FIVE PER CENT FOR SEVEN YEARS A CUT WOULD BE A BOOST FOR SOME MORTGAGE HOLDERS AND LESS GOOD FOR SAVERS ADAM POSEN FORMER MEMBER OF THE M.P. SEE SAID THE BANK SHOULD BE BOLD
THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE GOOD CHOICES AT THIS POINT SO I THINK WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IS CUT RATE TWO ZERO IN ONE FELL SWOOP
AND THEREBY GIVE THE SHOCK AND AWE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY
OTHERS HAVE WARNED THE BANK AWAY FROM MOVING TOO SWIFTLY THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE ECONOMIC DATA PUBLISHED SINCE DOING THE TWENTY THIRD AND THE FALL IN THE VALUE OF STERLING CAN ACT AS A STIMULUS AS EXPORTS BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE
PROPERTY SURVEYOR SAY THERE'S BEEN A NOTICEABLE DROP IN ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSING MARKET SINCE THE REFERENDUM A REPORT FROM THE SURVEYORS' ORGANISATION THE R.I.C.S. SUGGEST SALES HAVE FALLEN SHARPLY ESPECIALLY IN LONDON AND THAT ENQUIRIES FROM NEW BUYERS ARE DION SIGNIFICANTLY

# DE MONTFORT REPORTING THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN EXCUSE ME A MAN WHOSE FAMILY IS REPORTED TO HAVE DONATED FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS TO LABOUR'S GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN IS TO LAUNCH A LEGAL CASE TO KEEP JEREMY CORBIN
OFF THE BALLET IN THE NEW LEADERSHIP ELECTION UNLESS HE CAN SECURE THE SUPPORT OF FIFTY ONE TEN P.'S THAT'S THE THRESHOLD FOR CHALLENGERS OF COURSE BUT THE RULING NATIONAL EXECUTIVE OF THE PARTY DECIDED ON TUESDAY NIGHT THAT IT DIDN'T APPLY TO THE MAN TRYING TO KEEP HIS JOB MICHAEL FOSTER IS THE CHALLENGER LABOUR PARTY DONOR I AM AS WELL A FORMER PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE AND IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING WHY ARE YOU DOING IT WELL THE ISSUE RAISED BY MY APPLICATION TO THE COURT IS A SIMPLE ISSUE OF THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES OF THE PARTY IT'S THE SAME ISSUE WHICH THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HATCHET CONSIDER ON TUESDAY NIGHT DO THEIR RIGHTS
RULES GIVE THE LEADER INCUMBENT LEADER THE RIGHT TO STAND WITHOUT THE RELEVANT NOMINATIONS
AND I'M SIMPLY CONCERNED THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IT'S ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW IT'S ESSENTIALLY A LEGAL ISSUE TO DO WITH THE CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES OF THEM RUSSIA ASSOCIATION LABOUR PARTY
WHICH I'M A MEMBER AND THEY HAD SOMEHOW DO YOU KNOW SOME PRETTY CLEAR LEGAL ADVICE DIDN'T THEY THE ANY SEA INCLUDING FOR MICHAEL MANSFIELD Q.C. VERY SENIOR LAWYER AND HE CONCLUDED THE RULES BY WHICH LABOUR PARTY'S GOVERNOR UNAMBIGUOUS THE LEADER DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY SIGNATURES TO BE NOMINATED IN A LEADERSHIP ELECTION WHERE THERE'S A POTENTIAL CHALLENGE
THERE WERE THREE BITS OF LEGAL ADVICE ALL OF WHICH FROM DIFFERENT Q.C.S ALL OF WHICH WERE CONTRARIAN AND NONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM WERE UNBIASED IN THEIR VIEW
OF THAT ADVICE ALL I AM SIMPLY SAYING IS THE ADVICE THAT WAS TAKEN WAS CERTAINLY NOT GIVEN THE EXPERT CONSIDERATION THAT IT WOULD RECEIVE FROM A HIGH COURT JUDGE
AND EVERYONE IN THE ROOM HAD A DIFFERENT POLITICAL AGENDA AND RULES OF ASSOCIATION SUCH AS A BOWLS CLUB A CHURCH
A SYNAGOGUE A CRICKET CLUB AND THE LABOUR PARTY SHOULD BE ADJUDICATED
BY A NEUTRAL COURT OF LAW BUT ALL THOSE BODIES ALSO WOULD BE ADJUDICATED BY A SENSE OF NATURAL JUSTICE AND ARE YOU NOT IMPRESSED BY WHAT LEN MCCLUSKEY TOLD US EARLIER ON IN THE WEEK HE IS IF YOU WANT TO CHALLENGE THE INCUMBENT SURELY THE BASIS OF NATURAL JUSTICE AND A BRITISH SENSE OF FAIR PLAY IS HOW HE PUT IT IS THAT THE INCUMBENT HAS TO BE IN A POSITION TO DEFEND HIMSELF SO YOU'VE GOT TO GET HIM ONTO THE BALLET OTHERWISE IT'S JUST GOING TO SEEM LUDICROUSLY UNFAIR
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT NATURAL JUSTICE WOULD BE LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NATURAL JUSTICE WOULD NOT BE IF A LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY AT SOME PARTICULAR TIME CLEARLY NOT MISTER CORBIN PRACTISED SOME ELEMENT OF MALFEASANCE
AND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO M.P.S VOTED HIM DOWN IN A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE
SO THAT HE HAD NO ABILITY TO USE THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY TO MAKE LEGISLATION OR OPPOSED LEGISLATION ON BEHALF OF THE LABOUR PARTY
IT WOULD BE CLEARLY LUDICROUS THAT THE LEADER IN THAT INSTANCE COULD SELF NOMINATE WITHOUT SUPPORT
ANY M.P. YEAH BUT I'M LOOKING AT THIS INSTANCE AND IN THIS INSTANCE HE'S GOT HUGE BACKING IN THE PARTY HASN'T BEEN IN THE JOB FOR LONG HE SAYS HE WANTS TO DO IT IT WOULD BE JUST AS A MATTER OF PRACTICAL POLITICS AS WELL JUST TO EXCLUDE HIM FROM THE BALLET WOULD BE CRAZY WOULDN'T IT
I'M VERY SORRY BUT WHEN YOU CAN
MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATION AND IT HAS A SET OF RULES YOU CANNOT IN BRITAIN A DEMOCRACY THAT STANDS OR FALLS BY THE APPLICATION OF LAW
BEND THE RULES TO SUIT A PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OR PARTICULAR POSITION THAT IT BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR
I DID OPPOSE OR DID NOT VOTE FOR JEREMY WHEN HE STOOD BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS AND AT THE PRESENT TIME I CHEW THINK THAT GERMANY SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO BE ON THE BALLOT BUT NOT AN AUTOMATIC RIGHT JUST IN ONE WORD WHEN YOU GOING HAIR DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOUR LEGAL CASE NOW AS IT WAS GOING TO BE DONE IN DAYS OR WEEKS OR WHAT
IF THE CASE IS HURT AND I THINK IT WILL BE HEARD I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE HEARD THE MATTER WILL BE DUE GATED IN DAYS NOT WEEKS O.K. MICHAEL FOSTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT WAS A NEW PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT LIKE NO OTHER THERESA MAY LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERAS IN DOWNING STREET AND TOLD ORDINARY WORKING CLASS FAMILIES WHO WERE ONLY JUST MANAGING THAT SHE WANTED TO SPEAK TO THEM DIRECTLY CAN SHE WIN THEIR SUPPORT AND HOW DOES SHE INTEND TO DO IT I'LL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS HAS BEEN TO ESSEX TO FIND OUT
THE CONSERVATIVES WERE PUT OURSELVES AT THE SERVICE OF ORDINARY WORKING PEOPLE THE MAY VISION THOSE CONSERVATIVES IN GOVERNMENT FOR WORKING PEOPLE
I BELIEVE THAT WHEN I SAY I DON'T REALLY ALWAYS KNOW IF THEY'VE GOT ANY IDEA ORDINARY WORKING CLASS PEOPLE ON THE BOAT WHY ARE THEY HAD TO COME
IN HARLOW IN ESSEX PLENTY OF SCEPTICS I DON'T KNOW THE CONSERVATIVES SEEM TO HAVE DRIFTED AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE
AND THEY'RE MORE FOR THE BANKERS AND
BUSINESSES COME AND LIVE MY LIFE A FEW
HOW DIFFERENT IT IS TO HER LIFE SHE NEEDS TO COME DOWN TO GRASS ROOTS AND WE SPEND TIME WITH HIM LIKE WE DO TO KNOW WHAT WE DO AND EARLIER TORY PRIME MINISTER CHANGE THE LIVES OF WORKING CLASS FAMILIES WITH A SCHEME THAT STILL SHAPES SOME CONSERVATIVE THINKING TODAY IF YOU'VE BEEN A COUNCIL TENANT FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE THE RIGHT BY LORD TO BUY YOUR HOUSE ON THERE TO
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BUY IT AT A PRICE THAT ONE THIRD BELOW MARKET VALUE MARGARET THATCHER'S RIGHT TO BUY POLICY LIVES ON BUT THERE'S NOT THE SAME COUNCIL HOUSING STOCK LEFT TO SELL OFF HER THERESA MAY SHE WOULD NEED A RATHER DIFFERENT PLAN STILL UNLESS WE DEAL WITH THE HOUSING DEFICIT WE WILL SEE HOUSE PRICES KEEP ON RISING
SHE'S CLEAR THOSE CLOSE TO HER A CLEAR HOUSING'S AT THE HEART OF THEIR AMBITIONS FOR EVEN A FEW THOUSAND TO PUT
A DEPOSIT DOWN AND IT'S NOT GONE UNNOTICED BY HOW THOSE CONSERVATIVE M.P. WHO'S SPENT HER CAREER INSISTING HIS PARTY DO MORE FOR THESE VOTERS ROBERT HELFEN WE NEED TO MAKE A COMMITMENT JUST AS WE WANT TO HAVE HELP PEOPLE WRITE TO BUY BUT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO FUND IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER WHETHER IT'S THROUGH TAX INCENTIVES OR YOU AND THREW YOU THE EXCHEQUER BUILDING SOCIAL HOUSING ACROSS THE U.K.
A MASSIVE NEW SOCIAL HOME BUILDING PROGRAMME THEY'VE NOT PROMISE THAT BUT MANY SENSE AN OPPORTUNITY SEAN WORTH AN ADVISOR HE'S WORKED CLOSELY WITH MISSUS MAY'S AIDS IN THE PAST
A NEW PROMISE IT DOES HAVE SOME POLITICAL LICENCE TO BE A LOT MORE RADICAL THAN PERHAPS SHE WOULD GET AWAY WITH ORDINARILY THAT AN AGENDA YOU COULD REALLY GET YOUR TEETH INTO MIXING PROGRESS FOR EXACTLY THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT APPEALING TO THAT AT ALL TO UNIVERSITY THEN YOU KNOW SHE WANTS BY PROPERTY SHE'S GOT TO FIVE GOT THOSE HOW MUCH JUST PUT A DEPOSIT DOWN ON A PROPERTY YOU KNOW THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING A WORKING PERSON
FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT CONVINCING EVEN SOME TORY VOTERS THAT ANYONE CAN LIVE AT NUMBER TEN AND UNDERSTAND THEIR LIVES IS ONE CHALLENGE PROVING THEY CAN CHANGE THOSE LIVES THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH
O.K. THEY WERE FROM A DIFFERENT THEY'RE ALL FROM A DIFFERENT CLASS O.K. MORE MIDDLE CLASS UPPER CLASS APPARENTLY THIS PLACE TO BE IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY PRIME MINISTER EVER WILL BE
# THAT WAS ROSS HAWKINS REPORTING FROM ESSEX TIME SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW OUR SHOPPERS KEEPING THEIR MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS FOLLOWING OF THE REFERENDUM VOTE WE ARE GOING TO FIND AT LEAST THE BEGINNINGS OF AN ANSWER TO THAT VERY VERY VITAL QUESTION TODAY SEVERAL BIG RETAILERS HAVING THEIR FINANCIAL RESULTS DOMINIC
IT'S A SET UP HAS BEEN FOR DOOM AND GLOOM LAST WEEK WE HAD A SURVEY FROM THE MARKET RESEARCH THEN G. OF K. WHICH SUGGESTED THAT BRITISH CONSUMER CONFIDENCE FELT AT THE SHARPEST RATE AND ALMOST TWENTY TWO YEARS AFTER THE BRICKS HAVE VOTE BUT THE EVIDENCE FROM THE FROM THE FIGURES THIS MORNING WE'VE HAD NUMBERS FROM MOTHER CLEAR SUPER DRY AND HELP THAT'S A GOOD SELECTION OF HIGH STREET
THEY WOULD SEEM TO SAY THE CONSUMERS AREN'T QUITE BEHAVING LIKE THAT THAT ACTUALLY SPINNING FIND THE RESULTS ARE NOT STELLA BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY O.K. AND AS MOTHER CASE CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARK NEWTON JONES PUTS IT IN HIS RESULTS STATEMENT WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY IMMEDIATE CONSUMER REACTION TO THE BRICKS IT VOTE WITH ME TO TALK ABOUT THESE THESE FIGURES AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN GENERAL IT'S JOHN COPS LIKE THE CHEAP RETAIL ANALYST AT THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE INTELLIGENCE
JOHN THE EXPECTATION WAS THAT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE WAS FALLING POLICE NUMBERS ARE NOT DISASTROUS WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN READ TOO MUCH INTO THEM
I THINK IT'S VERY EARLY TO SAY AT THESE NUMBERS ONLY REFLECT REALLY ONE WEEK OF THE SUPPOSED TO IT'S I THINK AND I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY MORE SIGNIFICANT CARE PUT THAT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DROPPED LAST WEEK
I THINK AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE SOME VERY TOUGH TIMES AHEAD FOR RETAIL I THINK THAT STRUCTURALLY THIS COMES AT A TIME WHEN THERE ARE STRUCTURAL CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN RETAIL THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS WELL SO MIGHT BE EH SEE THE BRICKS OF VOTE AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE WHO ACTUALLY IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF AFFECT IS RESHAPING THE HIGH STREET THAT MIGHT ACCELERATE SOME OF THOSE FACTORS YEAH IT'S TRUE I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT B.H.S. B.H.S. IS FAIRLY HAD THAT HAPPEN BEFORE PRAXIS AND THAT'S ALSO BEEN AUSTIN REED THIS YEAR THAT THAT ALSO FELL BEFORE
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF CHANGES GOING ON THE CHALLENGE FROM DISCOUNTERS THE THE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER PEOPLE ARE SHOPPING IN TERMS OF BUYING GOODS ONLINE ET-CETERA WE SAW SOME PRIME DAY YESTERDAY SO THAT THOSE THOSE FACTORS ARE ALSO GOING TO UNDERMINE HIGH STREET SALES ONE OF THE BIG THINGS OR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO USE THEIR WAS A WEEK A POUND
BRITISH SHOPPERS HAVE BEEN USED TO THE PRICE OF GOODS PICKLEY GROCERIES GOING DOWN FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED BUT YOU DIG IS THIS KIND OF THING THAT'S LIKE A CHANGE ISN'T IT YEAH THIS IS SOMETHING OF A DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR RETAILERS I THINK ON THE ONE HAND THAT THEIR COST BASE IS GOING TO GO UP AS THE POUND STERLING WEAKENS AND THAT MEANS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THE MARGIN SQUEEZE ON ONE SIDE WHEREAS BEFORE THEY WERE ENJOYING VERY CHEAP PRICES
BEING INSIDE IS AS CONSUMED REIGN IN SPENDING A CONSUMER CONFIDENCE THERE'S DROP AND THEY CERTAINLY STOP SWIMMING AND BIG TICKET ITEMS THEIR MARGINS CAN BE SQUEEZED FROM THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL BECAUSE CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO WANT TO SPEND LESS SO IN A WAY THIS KIND OF BRINKMANSHIP HERE WERE SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE IN THE MIDDLE FOR RETAILERS AND VERY QUICKLY IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT RETAILERS ARE A BIT LIKE EXPORT OF SOME OF THE RETAILERS LIKE BURBERRY THEY DO QUITE WELL ON THE POUND AS WE DON'T THEY YES I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE MOTHER COW RESULTS FOR ANOTHER FACTOR THERE SEVEN THE HAS EXTENSIVE IN SUCH OPERATIONS AND THEY WOULD HAVE BENEFITED FROM COUNTY HEADWINDS
WE'RE GOING TO GET SOMETHING LIKE A NINETY MILLION POUND PUNT FROM FROM THERE FROM THEIR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THEY'VE SUCH STRONG OPERATIONS IN CHINA WHICH EVEN NOW THAT'S BEEN DOING VERY WEAKLY IN CHINA IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD FOR THEM TO SEE THE CURRENCY COME BACK TO A MIXED PICTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN COBB STEAK FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT
# THANKS DOMINIC IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN COULD SCIENTIST BE ON THE BRINK OF FINDING A CURE FOR H.I.V. AFTER TEST FOR A NEW DRUG DEVELOPED IN THE U.K. SHOWED IT FINDING AND KILLING DORMANT H.I.V. IN HUMAN CELLS LUCY DORRELL IS PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD AND WORKED WITH THE DRUG COMPANY IMMUNO CALL ON THE TREATMENT SHE'S IN OXFORD STUDIO GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR GOOD MORNING WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING TO THESE DORMANT THE STORMONT FORM OF H.I.V.
SO THIS DORMANT FORM OF H.I.V. IS THE REASON WHY WE CAN'T CURE PEOPLE WITH H.I.V. WITH THE CURRENT ANTIRETROVIRAL MEDICATIONS THAT WE HAVE THEY'RE VERY EFFECTIVE AT KEEPING THE VIRUS IN CHECK AND STOPPING DAMAGE TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM BUT THEY DON'T WORK AGAINST THESE CELLS THAT ARE CARRYING THE DORMANT FORM OF H.I.V. BUT THIS NEW TREATMENT YOU WORKED ON DEAD
YES IT'S BEING PRECISION ENGINEERED TO FIND THOSE CELLS THAT ARE CARRYING H.I.V. AND TO RECRUIT WILL HARNESS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO HELP TO DESTROY THEM AND IT DOES THIS MORE EFFECTIVELY OR MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN THE BODY'S NATURAL IMMUNE RESPONSE A BIT OF A NEW YOU ACHIEVED THIS
IN LABORATORY CONDITIONS ALTHOUGH THESE WEB CELLS TAKEN FROM THE HUMAN BODY THAT'S RIGHT THESE WERE CELLS TAKEN FROM BOTH HEALTHY PEOPLE WITHOUT H.I.V. AND PEOPLE WITH H.I.V. WHO ARE WELL CONTROLLED ON THEIR MEDICATION AND WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THE DRUG WORKED IN THE WAY THAT WE EXPECTED IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS ABLE TO FIND THE CELLS AND
DESTROY THEM BUT AS YOU SAY THESE ARE LABORATORY CONDITIONS AND THE REAL PROOF WILL BE WHEN WE TEST THIS IN PATIENTS BUT LOOKING AT THE RESULTS YOU HAVE SO FAR DO YOU THINK WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF A BIT OF A BREAKTHROUGH OF A CURE
THIS IS A VERY EARLY WORK BUT IT IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR AN ENTIRELY NEW TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS WHICH IS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THIS THIS BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE OF TRYING TO ELIMINATE THESE REMAINING CELLS IN THE BODY THAT ARE HARBOURING H.I.V. SO I THINK THIS PAVES THE WAY FOR A REALLY EXCITING AND AN IMPORTANT
APPROACHES TO DO USE COMBINATIONS OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO TRY AND CURE PEOPLE OF H.I.V. DO WHAT WOULD YOU DO NEXT THEN TO TRY AND DEVELOP THIS SO WE HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE WORK IN THE LABORATORY TO CONFIRM OUR FINDINGS TO MODEL ANY EFFECTS ON TISSUES TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO UNWANTED EFFECTS AND TO DEVELOP AND DESIGN A CLINICAL TRIAL WHEREBY WE CAN TEST THIS DRUG IN PATIENTS
BUT A BIT A BIT THE IMPORTANCE OF GET GETTING TO ALL FORMS OF A VIRUS THAT MIGHT BE IN A HUMAN BODY ON THE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE DORMANT VIRUS CAN BECOME RESEARCH URGENT AND BECAUSE THERE ARE PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE EXACTLY SO WE WE'VE HAD
HUGE PROGRESS IN MAKING ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS AVAILABLE TO PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE THEY'RE MOST NEEDED BUT LESS THAN A FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO NEED TREATMENT RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY GETTING IT AND WHEN SOMEBODY STARTS TREATMENT THEY'RE TAKING MEDICATIONS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO YOU KEEP TRYING TO TO DEVELOP A CURATIVE INTERVENTIONS WHICH MEAN THAT AT SOME POINT PEOPLE WITH H.I.V. COULD ACTUALLY SAFELY STOP THEIR MEDICATION AND THEY WOULDN'T BE DEPENDENT ON IT SOUNDS EXCITING THANK YOU
# AND COULD A HEAD THANK YOU PROFESSOR LUCY DALTON UNIVERSITY OXFORD TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN TIME TO LOOK AT THE SPORT AND CARVINGS ARE GOLF THIS MORNING THEY'VE ALREADY GOT ON THE WAY THEY HAVE A D.

ONE OF THE LEADING BRECK'S AT CAMPAIGNERS BORIS JOHNSON SAID HE WAS PROUD AND HUMBLE TO HAVE BEEN NAMED THE NEW FOREIGN SECRETARY AMONG THE OTHER APPOINTMENTS LAST NIGHT PHILIP HAMMOND TO REPLACE GEORGE OSBORNE AS CHANCELLOR AND AMBER RUDD BECAME HOME SECRETARY
MISSUS MAY HAVE SPOKEN BY PHONE TO THE LEADERS OF GERMANY AND FRANCE SHE TOLD CHANCELLOR MERKEL AND PRESIDENT ALARMED HER GOVERNMENT WOULD NEED TIME TO PREPARE FOR NEGOTIATIONS ON BRITAIN'S DEPARTURE FROM THE E.U.
# LABOUR DONOR IS PLANNING A LEGAL CHALLENGE TO THE PARTY'S WILLING THAT JEREMY CORBIN CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED IN THE LEADERSHIP BALLOT MICHAEL FOSTER WHOSE FAMILY DONATED FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PINTS TO THE PARTY TOLD US HIS DECISION WASN'T ABOUT POLITICS HE SAID HE WAS CONCERNED LABOUR'S RULING BODY THE ANY SEA HASN'T FOLLOWED THE CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES
# THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS EXPECTED TO CUT INTEREST RATES TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE HEIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IS SORT THE RATES MAY BE HALVED TO NOUGHT POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT TO ENCOURAGE MORE SPENDING IN AN EFFORT TO BOOST THE ECONOMY
# PROPERTY SURVEYOR SAY THEY EXPECT HOUSE PRICES IN THE U.K. TO FALL OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. THEIR MONTHLY REPORTS SUGGEST THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES BEING PUT UP FOR SALE IS FALLING AT THE SHARPEST RATE SINCE RECORDS BEGAN HUNGARY HAS REJECTED CLAIMS THAT IT'S POLICE AND SOLDIERS ARE USING EXCESSIVE FORCE TO EXPEL MIGRANTS TRYING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY FROM SERBIA HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH SAYS MIGRANTS ARE BEING BEATEN AND FORCED ACROSS THE BORDER
# POLICE IN AUSTRALIA OR USING THE FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF A BRITISH BACKPACKERS MURDER TO APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC FOR INFORMATION TO HELP FIND HIS REMAINS A DRUG DEALER BRADLEY MURDOCH WAS CONVICTED OF KILLING PETER FALK NEO WHO WAS TWENTY EIGHT AND FROM HUDDERSFIELD IN THE OUTBACK BUT HAS NEVER CONFESSED TO THE CRIME AND MISTER FALCON WHOSE BODY HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND THE TIME IS NOW HALF PAST SEVEN
# FOR SEVEN YEARS THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETINGS HAVE COME AND GONE WITHOUT MUCH ATTENTION THAT IS HOW LONG WE'VE HAD INTEREST RATES AT HALF A PER CENT BUT IT MIDDAY TODAY WE DISCOVER IF THE BANKERS DECIDED TO CUT RATES DOWN TO A QUARTER OF A PER CENT OR POSSIBLY EVEN DOWN TO ZERO IF HE CUT COMES IT WILL BE PART OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY'S EFFORT HAS TRANSMIT STABILITY IN THE WAKE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COMMAND AHMED HAS BEEN CONSIDERING THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE POTENTIAL FOR HIS PLANS TO BEAR FRUIT
LIKE THEY WENT IN THE THE PLAY TO GAR GAR FROM MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND NINE ANDY I'M SURE ALL TODAY LISTENERS KNOW NUMBER ONE THE LAST TIME INTEREST RATES WERE CHANGED CUT TO A RECORD LOW OF NOUGHT POINT FIVE PER CENT
HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE AN EMERGENCY MEASURE
SEVEN YEARS LATER AND WITH SLIGHTLY LESS OF A POKER FACE CARNE THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS SIGNALLED THAT HE IS FINALLY READY FOR A MOVE BUT NOT AS MANY EXPECTED A YEAR AGO PUSHING INTEREST RATE UPWARDS
BUT DOWN AGAIN AS FEAR STALKED THE ECONOMY A RECESSION COULD COME COURTESY OF POST REFERENDUM UNCERTAINTY WITH WESTMINSTER INFLUX SOME OF SEE MISTER CARNEY AS A ONE MAN STABILITY MECHANISM
OFFERING REASSURANCE AS POLITICIANS REPLACE EACH OTHER WITH ALARMING REGULARITY MAYBE EVEN TOO MUCH OF A ONE MAN BAND THE ALL POWERFUL GOVERNOR PULLING THE LEVERS OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO SAY HE'S BEEN SOMETHING OF AN OASIS OF STABILITY IS SENIOR ECONOMIST AT THE M.P. PARA INVESTMENT PARTNERS
I THINK THE TRUTH IS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ALWAYS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY INFLUENTIAL WITHIN THE INSTITUTION AND IT TENDS TO BE THE CASE YOU'RE GOING TO GET POWERFUL PERSUASIVE INTELLECTUALLY CAPABLE PEOPLE RUNNING THESE INSTITUTIONS AND THEY WERE ALWAYS TEND TO BRING PEOPLE TOWARDS THEIR VIEW
WHAT DOES WORRY ME IS THERE IS SO MUCH AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO MUCH CONSENSUS WITHIN THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE AROUND WHAT TO DO THEY ALMOST ALWAYS VOTE IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE THERE NOT ALWAYS A LIFE NOT ALWAYS VOTING FOR THE EXACT SAME OPTION
IT IS TRUE THAT OTHER FORMER MEMBERS OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE WHICH SETS INTEREST RATES HAVE ACCUSE MISTER CARNEY OF SUGGESTING THIS CARD IF CUT IT IS BEFORE YESTERDAY'S CRUCIAL MEETING OF THE M.P.C.
WELL THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE VIEW OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND THERE ARE OTHERS I COME TO BLACK ROCK IT'S ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST INVESTMENT FUNDS IT'S GOT A BIG OFFICE IN THE CITY
OF LONDON I'M HERE TO SEE RUPERT HARRISON HE USED TO BE CHIEF OF STAFF TO WARN GEORGE OSBORNE AND NOW HE'S A PRETTY BIG PLACE
HERE I WANTED TO ASK HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND I'LL SKIN WAS HE JUST TOO POWERFUL
I THINK HE'S BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF STABILITY ACTUALLY FOR MARKETS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WHEN WE'VE HAD A LOT OF POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS ON THE FRONT FOR THAT INITIALLY DOING WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO MONITOR FINANCIAL STABILITY ENSURE THERE WAS LIQUIDITY AND MARKETS AND NOW SENDING VERY CLEAR SIGNALS THEY'RE WILLING TO ACT ON MONETARY POLICY SO I THINK THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO I DOUBT THAT MARK CARNEY THINKS HE'S ALL POWERFUL BECAUSE ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE INSTITUTION THAT HE WORKS IN HE'S BEEN DESIGNED VERY DELIBERATELY SO THAT HE IS ONE MEMBER OF A COMMITTEE WHEN THERE WHERE THE BIG IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE GOING TO BE MADE
MONETARY POLICY THE CONTROL OF INTEREST RATES CAN ONLY CARRY SO MUCH OF THE BIRD AND IF THE ECONOMY DOESN'T NEED RESCUING I ASKED ADAM POSEN A FORMER MEMBER OF THE M.P. SEE IF PEOPLE WERE SIMPLY EXPECTING TOO MUCH OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND LIKE IT SOME KIND OF ECONOMIC SUPERMAN IT'S NOT THERE THE BANK OF ENGLAND OR OTHER CENTRAL BANKS SHOULD TRY TO RESPOND TO CRISES THAT'S THEIR JOB
BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE IS TOO MUCH COMPLACENCY AND TOO MUCH EXPECTATION THAT THE TOOLS WILL BE VERY EFFECTIVE AT THIS POINT I THINK WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IS CUT RATES FROM FIFTY TO ZERO IN ONE FELL SWOOP
THEREBY GIVE THE SHOCK AND AWE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY
IN CENTRAL LONDON ONE OF BRITAIN'S PROPERTY
MAY MAYBE BIG MACRO ECONOMIC REASONS LONG TERM REASONS FOR PROVIDING MORE STIMULUS TODAY
JUST RATE CUTS ALSO HAVE A DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE EFFECT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE'S MORTGAGES ARE TIED TO THEM
ONE POST BRICKS IT BEER IS THAT HOUSE PRICES COULD FALL IF THE ECONOMY SLOWS AND THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF A WEAKENING MARKET
GOODBYE TO SOME SUCKER FOR HOMEOWNERS I'M HERE TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE
LOOSELY AND BURN YOU GO ON AHEAD OF U.K. RESIDENT RESEARCHER
IF THE BACK WAS AGREED TO REDUCE INTEREST RATES TODAY
IS THAT GOOD NEWS FOR MORTGAGE HOLDERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING TO GET
THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A RATE WHICH IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE BANK BASE RATE SEE
STRAIGHTAWAY WHAT YOU WILL SEE IN TERMS OF WATER'S COMING TO THE MARKET WE'VE ALREADY SEEN A BIG CUT IN MORTGAGE RATES
WHETHER THEY WILL SEE THE IMPACT OF THAT RATE CUT REMAINS TO BE SEEN THERE MORTGAGED RACHEL
STRANGE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN MY DRAINS BIRDIED OFF TODAY'S NUMBER ONE AS I'M SURE ALL THAT'S WHERE
WE'LL KNOW BY BIG DAY WHEN THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS CAN'T RATES BUT NOT FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS WHETHER THAT ACTION HAS ACTUALLY HAD ANY EFFECT ON BRITAIN'S WOBBLY CONNOR
COME ON AHMED OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR OF REPORTING THERE ANDREW LILY COLE IS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF EUROPE ECONOMICS AND CHAIR OF THE FREE MARKET THINK TANK THE INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS SHADOW MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE WHICH IS A GROUP OF INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND YOU'VE WRITTEN TO THE TIMES TODAY ARGUING AGAINST A CUT WHY WE HAVE INDEED
OUR VIEW IS THAT ALTHOUGH THAT IN THE RUN UP TO AT THE BRACTS A REFERENDUM OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO THEY COULD HAVE BEEN ARGUMENTS FOR EITHER RAISING OR LOWERING INTEREST RATES EITHER WAY THE EVENTS OF THE REFERENDUM CLEARLY CHANGE THE CONTEXT IT AND WE THINK THAT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A BIT OF A PAUSE BEFORE TO REFLECT AND SEE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN TERMS OF THE DATA BEFORE DECIDING HOW TO REACT SO YOU'RE NOT SAYING AN INTEREST RATE CUT HE'S NOT NEEDED IT'S JUST NOT THIS MONTH
WELL IT MIGHT I MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE NEEDED AT THE BANK OR SAT OUT WHAT IT THOUGHT WOULD BE THE IMPACT OF THE AIR FOR FOLK TO LEAVE THE E.U. WHAT IT SAID WAS THAT THIS WOULD BE LIKE TO HAVE IMPACT BOTH ON DEMAND FOR GOODS OR SERVICES
THE ABILITY OF THE ECONOMY TO SUPPLY THEM AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CONTROL INFLATION IT DEPENDS CRUCIALLY ON THE BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA YET WHICH TELLS US HOW THE BALANCE OF THOSE THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHANGED SO IT COULD BE THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IT EVEN IF YOU THOUGHT I DON'T THINK THAT THE IMPACT SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY NEGATIVE OVER THE LONG TERM IT THEM IT'S LIKELY TO BE SOME NEGATIVE IMPACT THERE BUT THE SHORT TERM
BUT EVEN IF YOU THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE QUITE NEGATIVE BUT IN THE SHORT TIME IT COULD BE BUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS THE ABILITY OF THE ECONOMY TO SUPPLY WAS DROPPING WHICH WOULD THEN MEAN THAT ACTUALLY INCREASED INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U. RATHER THAN THAT BEING DEFLATION WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT IF ANYTHING THE BANKS SHOULD CONSIDER RAISING RATES AND WE'VE OF COURSE SEEN THE MAIN ACTUAL DATA POINT WE HAVE IS THAT THE POUND FELL QUITE A BIT AFTER WE DECIDED TO LEAVE
THAT'S LIKELY TO PROVIDE SOME STIMULUS TO THE ECONOMY IN ITS OWN WAY AND IN FACT TO ADD TO INFLATION AND TAKE IT AWAY O.K. I MEAN IT IS EARLY ON THE DATA FRONT THERE WE ARE HAVE HAD SURVEYS FROM BOTH THE SERVICES SECTOR AND THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY POINTED TO A SHOP SLOWDOWN DOWN FOR THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TUNE WAS THE WORST MONTH FOR SEVEN YEARS SHORTS THEY'RE WORDS ABSOLUTELY THERE WERE SOME SLOWDOWN IN THE PERIOD IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM BUT THAT WAS OF COURSE BEFORE WITH THE RESULT THAT THE TIME WHEN WE WERE EXPECTED TO REMAIN AND THE POT OF WHAT PART OF THE POINT WOULD BE THAT THE
A REFERENDUM RESULT ITSELF CHANGES THE CONTEXT AND ONE SHOULD WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED SUBSEQUENTLY THE IT'S THAT IT'S THAT KEY POINT WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THESE THINGS I DON'T THINK AT THIS POINT IN TIME BECAUSE THERE'S A DANGER THAT BY ACTING IN THIS WAY THE BANK DOESN'T HAVE MUCH EFFECT BY CUTTING THE INTEREST RATE BECAUSE RATES ALREADY SOLO RATES RATE'S ALREADY OFF AT HALF POINT THEY DIDN'T STAY AT A HALF POINT FOR THOSE SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE
PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD CUT THEM ANY FURTHER IT WAS BECAUSE ONCE YOU GO THAT LOW RATE CHANGES BECOME COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE AT SOME OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO GO INTO NEGATIVE RATES IT HASN'T BEEN SEEM TO WORK FOR A TOTALLY WELL IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE IN THE ECONOMY NOW THE CORRECT THING WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN TO DO ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE EASING SO WHY A RATE CAPPED RATHER THAN VOTING FOR ADDITIONAL CARRY IT WELL WHAT WE SUGGESTED IT WHAT WE SUGGESTED A LETTER WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE WOULD BE
AND WE HAD SOME DISCUSSION THIS MEETING ON TUESDAY WOULD BE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO SEEK ORTH AUTHORISATION TO DO ADDITIONAL QUANTITY TO BE USING AND THEN HOLD THAT IN THE LOCKER IN CASE THEY NEED IT FOR LATER IN THE YEAR WE THINK THIS IS TOO EARLY IN TERMS OF THE DATE AT THIS STAGE TO JUSTIFY HAVING A RATE CUT ALL RATHER ACTIONS YOU WILL HAVE HEARD IT COME ON PLEASE ADAM POSE AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE SAYING THE REASON THEY SHOULD CUT RATE IS TO IS IN HIS WORDS
GIVE SHOCK AND AWE SHOW THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY NOT A SIGNAL BUT IT BUT IT IS BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE THING WHY WOULD THE BANK OF ENGLAND REACTED THE REFERENDUM BY SIGNALLING THAT IT THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS SOME KIND OF IMPENDING DOOM FOR THE ECONOMY TO STAVE OFF THE IMPENDING DOOM TRY TO YES BUT BUT THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE WHY WOULD THE FACT FOR EXAMPLE MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING WELL THIS IS SOME KIND OF BIG SHOCK TO CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
WHY WOULD THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE VOTED FOR SOMETHING MAKE THEM LESS CONFIDENCE IN WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE IT'S AN IDEA THAT WE FEAR THAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS BY JUST IT PRIVY PRODUCING A SIGNAL WHICH DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OTHER EFFECT YOU CREATE A FOCAL POINT WHICH WOULD THEN DRAGGED THE ECONOMY DOWN IN THE SHORT TERM RATHER THAN BOOST IT ANDREW LILY CODE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE DECISION OF COURSE WILL COVER AT MIDDAY
# THE TIME TWENTY TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND BORIS BOUNCES BACK IS THE DAILY MAIL'S FRONT PAGE HEADLINE OF THIS EXPRESSES SURPRISE THAT THERESA MAY AS HANDED THE KEY EACH OTHER FOREIGN SECRETARY DID BORIS JOHNSON THE MAIL SAYS IT TOOK MISSUS MAY JUST THREE HOURS TO STAMP OUR AUTHORITY ON NUMBER TEN SACKING GEORGE OSBORNE TURNING HER FORMER RIVAL INTO A GLOBAL AMBASSADOR FOR THE U.K. WILL ALSO TAKE CHARGE OF M.

# IT IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THE PRIVATE ART COLLECTION OF DAVID BOWIE WHICH IS LARGELY UNKNOWN TO THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO BE REVEALED FOR THE FIRST TIME NEARLY THREE HUNDRED WORKS BY ARTISTS INCLUDING DAMIEN HIRST HENRY MOORE STANLEY SPENCER ARE GOING TO GO ON DISPLAY AT SOTHEBY'S IN LONDON BEFORE BEING SOLD AT AUCTION IN NOVEMBER THEY'RE EXPECTED TO FETCH MORE THAN TEN MILLION POUNDS OUR ARTS CORRESPONDENT REBEKAH JONES HAS THIS EXCLUSIVE REPORT
BEHIND THREE SETS OF LOCKED DOORS IS A PRIVATE ROOM AT SOTHEBY'S I'VE COME HERE WITH THE ARTIST AND WRITER MATTHEW COLLINGS TO SEE SOME VERY SPECIAL PICTURES OWNED BY DAVID BOWIE
YOU'RE SAYING ALL THE COLOURS THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SATURATION WE'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF A HUGE SPIN PAINTING BY DAMIEN HIRST DAVID BOWIE HAD TO HAVE THAT HE REALLY VALUED
DAMIEN HIRST'S GLAMOROUS FREAKINESS
DAVID BOWIE BOUGHT HUNDREDS OF PICTURES BY MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY BRITISH ARTISTS INCLUDING FRANK AUERBACH PATRICK CORFIELD AND GRAHAM SUTHERLAND AND THEY HUNG ON THE WALLS OF HIS HOLMES HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIS COLLECTION IT'S A COLLECTION THAT REFLECTS A PARTICULAR PERSON
IT'S MOSTLY EMOTIONAL I WOULD CHARACTERISE IT AS BOHEMIAN ROMANTIC
EXPRESSIVE ART ART THAT CALLS FOR A GUT REACTION THAT'S IMMEDIATE BUT YOU FEEL EXCITED BY STRAIGHTAWAY
EVERYBODY KNOWS ME NOW WHILE THE WORLD'S KNOWS ALL ABOUT HIS MUSIC MUCH LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT DAVID BOWIE'S LIFE AS AN ART COLLECTOR IT WAS SOMETHING HE KEPT ALMOST ENTIRELY KEEPING FROM PUBLIC VIEW ALTHOUGH HE HINTED AT HIS PASSION IN A B.B.C. INTERVIEW
I'M NOT A BUYER OF THINGS I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT I'D BUY ADDICTIVE OBSESSIVELY PROBABLY IS
I THINK GIVEN COLLECTS TO BE SWANKY WHAT'S A BIG HIMSELF
HE REALLY COLLECTED BECAUSE YOU HAD A USE FOR THAT WORK AND IT WAS A PERSONAL USE TO SORT OF
NOT COS EMOTIONS A BIT IN ORDER TO CHANGE HIS STATE OF MIND I WOULD CALL THAT INSPIRATION WHEN THE BOOKS I HAVE THEM ALL OVER
THE ARTIST JOHN VIRTUE FLINGS HIS SKETCHBOOKS ACROSS HIS STUDIO THEY'RE FILLED WITH DRAWINGS HE'S MADE EXTRA MINUTE FLY WHAT
SPREAD OUT SPREAD OUT IN FRONT OF HIM HE THEN USES THEM TO CREATE HIS LARGE MONOCHROME LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS A FAVOURITE WITH DAVID BOWIE I HAD A PHONE CALL SAYING HI JOHN THIS IS DAVID I'M IN SAINT IVES CAN I COME UP AND SEE HIM AND I SAID
O.K. AND THE WHOLE OF THAT DAY WE WERE IN THE STUDIO WHO RANG ME IN THE EVENING SO I THOUGHT NOTHING BUT OUR CONVERSATIONS OUT OR NOTHING ABOUT THE WORKS I'M GOING BACK IN ON MONDAY TO GET SOME MORE AND HE DID AND SEVEN OF THEM ARE INCLUDED IN THE SALE
HELLO
THIS IS A JOURNAL THAT I KEEP US FROM TIME TO TIME I KEPT IT ON THE TWENTY SECOND OF FEBRUARY NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WHICH WAS THE NIGHT I MET DAVID
THIS WILLIAM BORE WAS INTRODUCED TO THE SINGER AT AN EDITORIAL BOARD MEETING FOR THE OLD MAGAZINE MODERN PAINTERS AND THE PAIR BECAME
I SAID WELL WE HAD A SMALL GOATEE UP CLOSE HIS FACE LOOKED QUITE LIVE DOING BAGGY
MIND YOU HE'S ALMOST FIFTY HOW CEILINGS FALSELY ABOUT ART I WAS EXTREMELY SERIOUS AND YOU GO TO ART SCHOOL HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
ARTISTS AND PAINTERS AND THEMES AND MOVEMENTS IT WAS NOT A HOBBY OR SOMETHING WHIM OF HIS HE WAS A VERY VERY SERIOUS PASSIONATE ENTREE
FANTASTIC LEAP SCUFFED DISTURBED SCRIBBLY IMPACTED SURFACE BUCKET SOTHEBY'S MATTHEW COLLINGS HE'S ADMIRING THE MOST VALUABLE WORK IN THE AUCTION THING THAT LOOKS LIKE
SORT OF GRAFFITI DAUBED ON THE WAR AIR POWER BY THE AMERICAN ARTIST JEAN MICHEL BASQUIAT IS EXPECTED TO FETCH UP TO THREE AND A HALF MILLION POUNDS I WOULD SAY THAT BASCA REALLY FITS IN
THE SENSIBILITY OF THE REST OF DAVID'S COLLECTION I THINK THAT'S TO DO WITH THAT VISCERAL EMOTIONAL IMPACT THAT HE LOOKS FOR IN ANY
# OUR ARTS CORRESPONDENT REBEKAH JONES REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN A CAMBRIDGE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND DOCTOR MICHAEL BANNER DEAN AND FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
NEW POLITICAL ADMINISTRATION SOMETIMES BEGIN IN GREAT EUPHORIA WHEN TONY BLAIR FIRST ENTERED DOWNING STREET IN MAY NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THERE WAS HEADY RHETORIC ABOUT THE ENDING OF ERAS AND EAGER EXCITEMENT AND ANTICIPATION AT WHAT THE NEW REGIME MIGHT DELIVER
FOR ME THIS MORNING'S POLITICAL DAWN FEELS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT NOT SO MUCH THE INTOXICATING EXCITEMENT OF WAKING TO A NEW DAY OPEN TO ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES MORE LIKE THE MORNING AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE
A NEW PRIME MINISTER SURELY AWAKES WITH METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING A CRACKING HEADACHE WHO'S SHE FACES UP TO HER CHALLENGE HOW TO RECONCILE THE DISAGREEMENTS AND TENSIONS WITHIN THE NATION AS WITHIN HER OWN PARTY REGARDING HOW WE SHOULD CONCEIVE OUR RELATIONS WITH THE REST OF EUROPE AND HAD TO DO THIS WHILE PROTECTING OUR ECONOMIC WELL BEING SENSITIVE AS THAT IS TO THE UNCERTAINTIES WHICH PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS THEMSELVES WILL EXACERBATE
FOR THE MOST PART CHRISTIANS HAVE THOUGHT THAT SOBER REALISM IS OF MORE APPROPRIATE MOOD FOR POLITICAL BEGINNINGS WILD EUPHORIA THIS IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF A CERTAIN ANXIETY CYNICISM ONE MIGHT SAY ABOUT THE BEHAVIOUR OF THOSE IN POWER
CERTAINLY THE OLD TESTAMENT ACCOUNTS OF THE SORRY MISS DEEDS OF SO MANY OF ISRAEL'S KINGS AND THE NEW TESTAMENTS PORTRAYAL OF THE PETTY POLITICAL MACHINATIONS WHICH LED TO CHRIST'S DEATH GO SOMEWAY TO JUSTIFYING THE PSALM MY SPIFFY INJUNCTION PUT NOT YOUR TRUST IN PRINCES
BUT IT IS ALSO A MATTER OF THE RECALCITRANT NATURE OF THOSE WHO ARE TO BE GOVERNED MOSES WAS ALWAYS COMPLAINING TO GOD ABOUT THE STIFF NECKED PEOPLE HE WAS CHARGED WITH LEADING AN SOLOMON ASK GOD WITH A TONE OF SOME DESPAIR WHO IS ABLE TO GOVERN THIS GREAT PEOPLE OF YOURS
BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS CHRISTIANITY HAS BEEN SOBERLY REALISTIC ABOUT THE FAILINGS OF RULERS AND OF THOSE THEY RULE IT WAS ALSO JUST TO MAKE THINGS A SPECIALLY DIFFICULT STILL HELD TO A HIGH IDEAL OF HUMAN SOCIETY
THE STORY OF PENTECOST WHEN GOD'S SPIRIT DESCENDS ON THE BELIEVERS OF ALL NATIONS GATHERED IN JERUSALEM SHORTLY AFTER JESUS'S DEATH PROVIDES AN EXALTED VISION OF UNITY BROUGHT FROM DIVERSITY
THOSE PEOPLE DIVIDED BY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ARE BROUGHT TO MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BY THE GIFT OF GOD'S SPIRIT ENABLING THEM TO COMPREHEND EACH OTHER'S TONGUES SO ALLOWING SYMPATHY AND FRIENDSHIP TO EXTEND ACROSS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES
IN CERTAIN CHRISTIAN RITES THE DIFFICULTY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN SYMBOLISED BY HAVING NEW BISHOPS DRAGGED TO THERE ARE PER SCRIBBLE CHAIRS BISHOPS WERE SUPPOSED INWARDLY TO SIGH NOT TO CHEER AS THEY WERE INSTALLED ON THEIR THRONES A NEW PRIME MINISTER INHERITS A FRACTIOUS PARTY A NATION DIVIDED AND DISINCLINED TO TRUST POLITICIANS AND THE PRESSING TASK OF RE ESTABLISHING GOOD RELATIONS WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS SHE WILL SURELY BE FORGIVEN FOR SIGHING NOT HUMMING THIS MORNING
BUT THEN IT BEHOVES THE REST OF US TO REMEMBER THAT LEADERSHIP IS A BURDEN IN PART JUST BECAUSE OF THE STIFF NECK PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO BE GOVERNED SO I HOPE FOR THIS PRIME MINISTER SAKE AS FOR ANY OTHERS WITH A SPIRIT OF UNDERSTANDING SYMPATHY AND FORBEARANCE ANIMATES NOT JUST OUR LEADERS BUT ALSO THOSE THEY WILL OTHERWISE STRUGGLE TO LEAD
# AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR MICHAEL BANNER THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT BORIS JOHNSON IS THIS NATION'S FOREIGN SECRETARY IN THE OLD DAYS THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT THAT HE WAS IN CHARGE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS INCLUDING COURSE RELATIONS WITH EUROPE BUT THESE ARE THE NEW DAYS AND THE VITAL WORK OF THESE NEW DAYS LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BEEN HANDED IT SEEMS TO ANOTHER NEW APPOINTMENT DAVID DAVIES WHO WILL OVERSEE A NEW MINISTRY OF BRECK SAID AND THAT'S WHAT A LIAM FOX IS GOING TO HAVE THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE SECRETARY DRUMMING UP NEW BUSINESS FOR BRITAIN
SO WHAT IS BORIS JOHNSON GOING TO DO AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW THESE NEW MINISTRIES GOING TO WORK SIR SIMON FRASER IS HERE WHO WAS UNTIL LAST YEAR THE PERMANENT UNDER SECRETARY THE BOSS AT THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH AS UND DIPLOMATIC HEAD DIPLOMAT HAS BORIS JOHNSON
WELL I THINK AS THE SAME FINANCIAL SERVICES PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO FOCUS ON TODAY'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND WHAT WHEN YOU MAKE THE FIRST ROUND OF CALLS AND WHEN HE HAS HIS FIRST MEETING AS WOULD YOU AS HIS SENIOR ADVISOR IF YOU WERE STILL IN THAT POSITION SAFE FOR INSTANCE ON OBAMA WHO HE CALLED APART KENYAN CAUSING QUITE A LOT OF OFFENCE WHEN HE MADE THOSE REMARKS WOULD YOU SAY
ADDRESS THEM IGNORE THEM OR WHAT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO MOVE FORWARD POLITICS IS POLITICS AND HE'S GOT A NEW JOB TO DO HE'S A VERY IMPORTANT JOB IT'S A RESPONSIBLE JOB IT'S A BUSY JOB IT'S A JOB IN WHICH YOU COMMAND ATTENTION YOU DON'T NEED TO SEEK ATTENTION
AND HE WILL BE SURROUNDED BY HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WHO WOULD ADVISE HIM I THINK HE WILL ADDRESS IT IN A PROFESSIONAL WAY AND ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE JOB WHICH YOU'VE JUST SAID IS IMPORTANT PEOPLE SAYING THE OPPOSITE A LOT OF JOURNALISTS COMMENTATORS BORIS WON'T HAVE A ROLE IN BRECK SETS AS THE ECONOMISTS JEREMY CLIFF THE CABBIE HENCE THE FROM THE GUARDIAN SAYING
BRECK'S IT WILL DO THE HEAVY LIFTING NUMBER TEN TAKES OVER FOREIGN POLICY IN A CRISIS WHAT'S LEFT IS THE IS THAT TRUE NO IT'S NOT TRUE I MEAN WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AS WHITEHALL BEING ORGANISED BY THE PRIME MINISTER QUITE RIGHTLY TO TACKLE AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE THE MASSIVE TASK THAT LIES AHEAD WHICH IS NEGOTIATING A DEPARTURE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S GOING TO BE A JOB THAT'S GOING TO INVOLVE THE WHOLE OF WHITEHALL BUT THE FOREIGN OFFICE IS GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY THE HEART OF IT BECAUSE THE FOREIGN OFFICE IS THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE MOST EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE
OF EUROPE BOTH IN LONDON AND OF COURSE TO OUR EMBASSIES AROUND THE WORD AT THE HEART OF IT OR IN CHARGE OF IT THEY'LL BE AT THE HEART OF IT WHO'S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE NEGOTIATION IS OBVIOUSLY DAVID DAVIS BECAUSE HE BECAUSE HE'S BEEN APPOINTED TO CONDUCT THAT NEGOTIATION THAT REALLY MATTERS DOESN'T IT THAT DOES TAKE AWAY A ROLL FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE IF NOT FROM THE FOREIGN SECRETARY YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE POLICY THAN SUBSTANCE OF THIS NEGOTIATION IS GOING TO COVER THE WHOLE RANGE OF DOMESTIC POLICIES
THE FOREIGN OFFICE IS GOING TO BE THE DEPARTMENT THERE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT SORT OF RELATIONSHIPS AND ENGAGEMENT INTERNATIONALLY TO ENSURE THAT WE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE IN A WAY WHICH HELPS US ACHIEVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME FOR THIS COUNTRY
AND I THINK IF ANYTHING I WOULD SAY IN RECENT YEARS A EUROPEAN POLICY HAS SUFFERED FROM INSUFFICIENT INVESTMENT CAN INVEST IN RELATIONSHIP BILLY DOES THE AT EXIT MINISTRY THAT HAVE ITS OWN
PHYSICAL POWER BASE WE UNDERSTAND IT'S GOING TO GET ITS OWN CIVIL SERVANTS IT WILL IT WILL DAVID DAVIES HAVE A PERMANENT SECRETARIES SEPARATE FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE WHERE PHYSICALLY WILL IT BE BUT IT'S EARLY DAYS MY UNDERSTANDING IS ONE OF THE OPTIONS WAS SIMPLY TO BOOST THE CENTRAL COORDINATION IN THE CABINET OFFICE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT HAS BEEN CHOSEN THAT THERE WILL BE A NEW DEPARTMENT FOR BRECHT'S IT IN FACT I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO SAY PUBLICLY THIS MAY BE NECESSARY
SO IT WILL BE ESTABLISHED AND CIVIL SERVANTS AND DIPLOMATS BUT SOME WILL BE MOVED INTO THAT FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS CLOSE CALLED ME WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE ON WHERE IT SHOULD SET IF IT'S NOT IN THE CABINET OFFICE WHICH IS WHERE AS YOU SAY THERE'S A EMBRYONIC OFFICE HAS BEEN UNDER RATHER LET WHEN IF IT'S NOT THERE OR COME IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE CAN WHERE WOULD IT GO
I ASSUME THAT AND A BUILDING OR ACCOMMODATION IS BEING SOUGHT NOW AND WILL HAVE TO BE FOUND AROUND THAT'S A TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM OTHER MINISTRIES ANOTHER SET UP SO THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING BUT IT'S EARLY DAYS AND I DON'T HAVE ALL THE DETAIL THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE COORDINATION ACROSS GOVERNMENT SO NOT ALL OF THE WORK OF BRECHT'S IT'S GOING TO BE DONE SIMPLY BY PEOPLE WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT THEY WILL BE REACHING OUT TO AND CAUGHT COORDINATING EXPERT TEAMS AND ALL THE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS WHITEHALL HOW MUCH OF
KERFUFFLE WILL IT CAUSE IN WHITEHALL THE CREATION OF THIS MINISTRY WITH YOUR INSIDER HAT ON BECAUSE WE WE'RE HERE ALREADY DON'T WE WITH THE THE EMBRYONIC MINISTRY THAT HAD BEEN SET UP IN THE CABINET OFFICE THAT THERE WAS UPSET THAT SOME VERY SENIOR PEOPLE MAY NOT VERY GOOD PEOPLE ARE BEING SUCKED INTO THAT
I'M NOT DOING OTHER THINGS WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE BEHIND THE SCENES A WAY IN WHICH IT'S SET UP GOING TO GOING TO SHOW US THE FIRST SATELLITE SAYS IN A BRITISH CIVIL SERVANTS AND DIPLOMATS ARE HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE AND THEY DO WHAT THEY'RE ASKED TO DO AND THEY WILL GET ON WITH THIS AND I THINK THEY'LL BE PLEASED ACTUALLY TO KNOW WHAT THE STRUCTURE IS GOING TO BE SO THEY CAN GET ON WITH GETTING THE DUCKS IN A ROW
TO UNDERTAKE THE NEGOTIATION ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WE DON'T LOSE TOO MUCH ENERGY AND TIME IN SIMPLY ORGANISING THE FURNITURE AND FINDING ACCOMMODATION BECAUSE WE'VE GOT NOW TO MOVE AHEAD WITH ESTABLISHING ON NEGOTIATING POSITION AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO CONDUCT THIS REALLY MAJOR CHALLENGE IN NEGOTIATING WITH EUROPE AND IN ENGAGING WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD
ALF HOW FAR THIS IS OR GO MORE TO THE SUBSTANCE OF IT HOW FAR DOWN THE ROAD CAN MISSUS MAY KICK THE CAN OF ARTICLE FIFTY IF SHE
BESIDES THAT THAT'S THE WAY SHE WANTS TO GO AND WHILE SHE'S PREPARING TO GET THE CIVIL SERVICE SORTED OUT WHILE SHE HAS HER INFORMAL TALKS IN REALISTICALLY WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PROGRAMME WANNABE BUT I PERSONALLY THINK THAT'S A BIT TOO MUCH ATTENTION BEING PLACED ON THE SIMPLE ISSUE OF TRIGGERING ARTICLE FIFTEEN WHAT REALLY MATTERS NOW IS THAT WE GET OUR PREPARATION RIGHT THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT TO DO IN TERMS OF ORGANISATION IN TERMS OF SETTING ON NEGOTIATING MANDATE IN TERMS OF THINKING THROUGH THE PROCESS
AND IT WOULD BE A BIG MISTAKE TO GO OFF HALF AT HALF COCK ON THIS WE NEED TO GET OURSELVES ORGANISED SO WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE CHANCE OF NEGOTIATING OUTCOME OVERTIME I SAY THIS BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE SAYING TO HER TAKE TIME WE RECOGNISE THAT THERE IS PRESSURE ON THE CONTINENT AND IN PUBLIC OPINION BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS RIGHT
# SIMON FRASER FORMER PERMANENT UNDERSECRETARY AT THE FUN KOMAROV OFFICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND PHILIP EVA IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER FORECAST
MICHELLE THANKS EXCUSE ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY GOOD MORNING TO ENGLAND AND WALES FIRST OF ALL A LOT OF FINE DRY WEATHER TO BE HAD TODAY THAT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE THIS MORNING THE ONE FLY IN THE OINTMENT IS THAT THERE WILL BE A SCATTERING AND NO MORE THAN THAT HAVE REALLY QUITE LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS SOME EASTERN COUNTIES DURING THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON BUT OTHERWISE DRY FINE THE CLOUD MAY DEVELOP
ROBBIE HAVE YOU SUNSHINE FOR A WEE WHILE BUT I THINK HE EVEN COME THIS AFTERNOON SOME OF THAT CLOUD WILL BEGIN TO PETER OUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT EASTERN SIDE TEMPERATURES AS CONSEQUENT SIXTEEN TO TWENTY ONE DEGREES FOR NORTHERN IRELAND PRETTY SIMILAR SORT OF FAIR HERE ALTHOUGH I THINK LATE ON IN THE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING IF YOU'VE GOT PLANS YOU'LL BE ROBBED OF YOUR DAY'S SUNSHINE SIMPLY BECAUSE A WEATHER FRONT IS LOOMING AT JUST OVER THE HORIZON QUITE LITERALLY THAT VEIL OF CLOUD WILL SPREAD HIM BUT BEFORE THAT WITH SOME SUNSHINE FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN WILL BE YOURS

OVERNIGHT WILL FILL THAT CLOUD IN AND FRIDAY A DIFFERENT BEAST ALTOGETHER WITH SOME PRETTY WET WEATHER EVENTUALLY FOR THE GREATER PART OF SCOTLAND PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND THE WESTERN HILLS AND COASTS OF ENGLAND PARTICULARLY THE NORTH AND WEST AND FOR WESTERN WALES TO ALL GETTING REALLY RATHER CLOUDY MURKY AND A WEE BIT WET AS WELL SO MY ADVICE IS MAKE THE MOST EACH DAY IF YOU

NEWS IS READ BY CATHY CLAXTON THERESA MAY WILL APPOINT MORE MINISTERS TO HER NEW CABINET TODAY AFTER STUNNING THE POLITICAL WORLD BY MAKING BORIS JOHNSON FOREIGN SECRETARY AND DISMISSING GEORGE OSBORNE
THIS MORNING THE NEW CHANCELLOR PHILIP HAMMOND SAID THE DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAD RATTLED CONFIDENCE IN THE MARKETS AND HE'D DO WHATEVER WAS NECESSARY TO STEADY THE ECONOMY HERE IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THE SCALE OF THERESA MAY'S RESHUFFLE IS PROVING MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE AND RADICAL THAN MANY EXPECTED UNDERLINING MISSUS MAY'S DESIRE TO SIGNAL A CLEAR BREAK WITH THE CAMERA AND YEARS IN THE SPACE OF ONE EVENING THE CHANCELLOR WAS SACKED BORIS JOHNSON GIVEN THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND KEY CAMPAIGNERS BROUGHT IN TO OVERSEE BRAX SIT WITH DAVID DAVIS'S BRECHT'S ADMINISTER AND LIAM FOX CHARGED WITH FORGING NEW TRADE DEALS
TO UNDERLINE HER COMMITMENT TO QUITTING THE E.U. MISSUS MAY ALSO CONCLUDED A SERIES OF PHONE CALLS WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS BY STRESSING HER COMMITMENT TO DELIVERING THE WILL OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THIS MORNING HOWEVER THE NEW CHANCELLOR PHILIP HAMMOND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BRECHT SAID HAD UNSETTLED THE MARKETS WITH COMPANIES PUTTING DECISIONS ON HOLD HE RULED OUT THOUGH THE PROSPECT OF AN EMERGENCY BUDGET
MEANWHILE LATER TODAY THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AS MISSUS MAY'S SEEKS TO MEET HER PLEDGED TO PROMOTE MORE WOMEN AND TO CREATE A GOVERNMENT FOCUSED ON THE CONCERNS OF WORKING PEOPLE WITH MANY OF HER APPOINTMENT SO FAR FIGURES FROM THE RIGHT OF THE PARTY
HOW MUCH APPETITE MISSUS MAY HAS FOR FURTHER PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM MAY ALSO BECOME CLEARER ONCE IT'S KNOWN WHO WILL BE THE SECRETARIES OF STATE FOR HEALTH EDUCATION AND WORK AND PENSIONS
# BORIS JOHNSON SAID HE WAS VERY PROUD AND HUMBLE TO TAKE OVER THE FOREIGN OFFICE THAT LABOUR M.P.S HAVE ALREADY CALLED ON HIM TO APOLOGISE TO BARACK OBAMA DURING THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN MISTER JOHNSON DESCRIBED THE PRESIDENT AS A PART KENYON WHO HARBOURED AN ANCESTRAL DISLIKE OF BRITAIN LAST NIGHT THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION URGED THE U.K. NOT TO DELAY THE START OF BRECHT'S AT NEGOTIATIONS AS A EUROPE EDITOR KATYA ADLER REPORTS
JEAN CLAUDE YOUNG SAID THE U.K. REFERENDUM HAD CREATED WHAT HE CALLED A NEW SITUATION WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED SOON POLITE WORDS THAT JUST ABOUT HIDE THE ENORMOUS FRUSTRATION HE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER E.U. LEADERS FEEL THAT THE U.K. IS CLEARLY IN NO IMMEDIATE HURRY TO START FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS TO LEAVE THERESA MAY'S NEW SECRETARY FOR BRECK SAID THE ANTI E.U. DAVID DAVIES HAS SAID AS MUCH
HIS APPOINTMENT ALONG WITH THAT OF THE LEADING LEAVE CAMPAIGNER BORIS JOHNSON AS FOREIGN SECRETARY WILL SET Y. YOU ALARM BELLS ARE RINGING A WORLD AWAY FROM THE CORDIAL LETTER JUST SENT TO THERESA MAY JEAN CLAUDE JUNKER ACCUSED MISTER JOHNSON OF TELLING UNTRUTHS TO BRITISH VOTERS BEFORE THE E.U. REFERENDUM
# A LABOUR DONOR IS MOUNTING A LEGAL CHALLENGE TO THE PARTY'S WILLING THAT JEREMY CORBIN CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED IN THE LEADERSHIP BALLOT MICHAEL FOSTER HE'S FAMILY DONATED FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS TO THE PARTY SAID HE WAS CONCERNED AT WHAT HE CALLED THE APPARENT MANIPULATION OF THE RULES BY LABOUR'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MY FASTER TOLD US HE WANTED THE RULES TO BE LOOKED AT BY AN INDEPENDENT JUDGE
THE ADVICE THAT WAS TAKEN WAS CERTAINLY NOT HER THE EXPERT CONSIDERATION THAT IT WOULD RECEIVE FROM A HIGH COURT JUDGE
AND EVERYONE IN THE ROOM HAD A DIFFERENT POLITICAL AGENDA AND RULES OF ASSOCIATION SUCH AS A BOWLS CLUB A CHURCH
A SYNAGOGUE A CRICKET CLUB AND THE LABOUR PARTY SHOULD BE ADJUDICATED BY NEUTRAL COURT OF LAW
# THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE ITS CUTTING INTEREST RATES TO A NEW RECORD LOW THEY'VE STOOD AT NOT POINT FIVE PER CENT SINCE MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WHEN THE BANK ANNOUNCED WHAT ARE CALLED AN EMERGENCY REDUCTION AT THE HEIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME OW AHMED HAS MORE DETAILS
WITH FEARS ARE GROWING THAT BRITAIN COULD BE FACING A RECESSION DUE TO UNCERTAINTY FOLLOWING THE REFERENDUM RESULT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE MORE STIMULUS TO THE ECONOMY THE BANK'S GOVERNOR MARK CARNEY HAS SIGNALLED THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE WHICH SETS INTEREST RATES IS POISED TO ACT
AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE MADE AT MID DAY ON WHAT COULD BE THE FIRST TO CHANGE IN THE RECORD LOW INTEREST RATE AT NOUGHT POINT FIVE PER CENT FOR SEVEN YEARS A CUT WOULD BE A BOOST FOR SOME MORTGAGE HOLDERS AND LESS GOOD FOR SAVERS ADAM POSEN FORMER MEMBER OF THE M.P. SEE SAID THE BANK SHOULD BE BOLD
THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE GOOD CHOICES AT THIS POINT SO I THINK WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IS CUT RATES TWO ZERO IN ONE FELL SWOOP
AND THEREBY GIVE THE SHOCK AND AWE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY
OTHERS HAVE WARNED THE BANK AWAY FROM MOVING TOO SWIFTLY THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE ECONOMIC DATA PUBLISHED SINCE DOING THE TWENTY THIRD AND THE FALL IN THE VALUE OF STERLING CAN ACT AS A STIMULUS AS EXPORTS BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE
# PROPERTIES SURVEYOR SAY THERE'S BEEN A NOTICEABLE DROP AN ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSING MARKET SINCE THE E.U. REFERENDUM A REPORT FROM THE SURVEYORS' ORGANISATION THE R. I C. S. SUGGEST SALES ARE DOWN AND PRICES ARE SET TO FALL HERE'S A PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT SIMON GUMPERT
SO FAR IT'S THE MORE EXPENSIVE PARTS OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND AND LONDON ESPECIALLY WHICH HAVE BEEN MOST AFFECTED BY THE BRECK'S IT VOTE WITH SALES FALLING THROUGH AND BUYERS TRYING TO GET MONEY OFF AT THE LAST MOMENT SOME ACHIEVING REDUCTIONS OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS AGENTS ESTIMATE THAT IN CENTRAL LONDON PRICES HAVE DROPPED BY FIVE PER CENT ALREADY THERE ON THE STREETS OF THE CAPITAL YOU'LL FIND PLENTY WHO WELCOME THAT BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD A HOME

# REBEKAH JONES REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT THE GOVERNMENT I LEAD WILL NOT BE DRIVEN BY THE INTERESTS OF A PRIVILEGED FEW THE WORDS OF THERESA MAY AS SHE ENTERED DOWNING STREET FOR THE FIRST TIME AS PRIME MINISTER THIS MORNING THEY'LL BE MORE APPOINTMENTS TO HER CABINET AFTER THE FIRST SIX INCLUDED THREE BIG ROLES GOING TO BRECK SITTERS INCLUDING BORIS JOHNSON AS FOREIGN SECRETARY AND THERE IS A CRUCIAL CHANGE IN THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT OFFICE IN THE LAND GEORGE OSBORNE WAS NOT MOVED SIDEWAYS BUT OUT
THE NEW CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER IS PHILIP HAMMOND AND HE'S IN OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO GOOD MORNING CHANCELLOR GOOD ONE CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU LET'S TALK FIRST ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND WATERED NEEDS WILL THERE BE AN EMERGENCY BUDGET
I DON'T ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR AN EMERGENCY BUDGET WE WILL WANT TO WORK CAREFULLY WITH THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND OTHERS THROUGH THE SUMMER TO PREPARE FOR THE AUTUMN STATEMENT WHEN WE WILL SIGNAL AND SET OUT THE PLANS FOR THE ECONOMY GOING FORWARD IN THE VERY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE NOW
FACE AND THEN THOSE PLANS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE BUDGET IN THE SPRING IN THE NORMAL WAY THAT'S A HUGE CHANGE ISN'T IT JUST THREE WEEKS AGO GEORGE OSBORNE WAS TELLING US THERE WOULD BE AN EMERGENCY BUDGET IN THE EVENT OF A BRICKS AT THOSE TACK RIGHT TAX RISES SPENDING CUTS
NOW YOU'RE SAYING NONE OF THAT'S NEEDED WE WILL FACE SOME CHALLENGES IN THE SHORT TERM IN MANAGING THE ECONOMY IT HAS HAD A SHOCK AS A RESULT OF THEIR DECISION ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT WAS SHAKEN CONFIDENCE IT HAS CAUSED MANY BUSINESSES TO PAUSE INVESTMENT DECISIONS
THAT THEY WERE MAKING I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR US NOW IS TO SEND SIGNALS OF REASSURANCE ABOUT THEIR FUTURE AS QUICKLY AND AS POWERFULLY AS WE CAN TO THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT COMMUNITY TO BRITISH BUSINESSES AND TO BRITISH CONSUMERS SO THAT WE CAN GET THOSE DECISIONS STARTING TO BE MADE AN INVESTMENT STARTING TO FLOW INTO THE U.K. ECONOMY I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR REASSURANCE BUT YOU WERE IN
INTEGRAL PART OF WHAT WAS CALLED PROJECT FEAR YOU SAID IN FEBRUARY THAT IN THE EVENT OF A BRITISH EXIT THERE WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY A CHILLING EFFECT ON INVESTMENT JOB CREATION AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AND WE'VE SEEN ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAPPENING OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS THERE HAS BEEN A CHILLING EFFECT WE'VE SEEN AN EFFECT IN MARKETS WE HAVE SEEN BUSINESS INVESTMENT DECISIONS BEING
PAUSED BECAUSE BUSINESSES NOW WANT TO TAKE STOCK WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE WILL TAKE FORWARD OUR RENEGOTIATION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT OUR ASPIRATIONS ARE FOR THE FUTURE TRADING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HE'S MOVED WITH SIGNIFICANT SPEED TO PUT IN PLACE A NEW GOVERNMENT
WHICH CAN START TO DELIVER THAT CERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE AND WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITH THE GOVERNMENT BEING APPOINTED AS WE SPEAK IS IMMEASURABLY STRONGER POSITION THAT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN IF WE WERE WAITING UNTIL SEPTEMBER THE NINTH FOR THE NEW PRIME MINISTER TO BE APPOINTED AND I THINK WE'VE NOW GOT THE SUMMER PERIOD TO TAKE STOCK
PREPARE OUR PLANS AND SET THEM OUT IN THE AUTUMN IN A WAY THAT I HOPE WILL RESTORE CONFIDENCE ABOUT WHERE THIS ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE WELL ALTHOUGH IF THERE IS THIS CHILLING EFFECT THAT YOU STILL BELIEVE HAS IS THE CASE AND IS HAPPENING NOW OR THEN SURELY THERE'S A STRONG ARGUMENT FOR DOING SOMETHING PRETTY SOON GEORGE OSBORNE WAS TALKING AFTER THE REFERENDUM ABOUT CUTTING CORPORATION TAXES HAVE YOU GOT A FISCAL STIMULUS IN MIND WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE
LOOK I'M NOT GOING TO IF YOU DON'T MIND I'M NOT GOING TO SET OUT A VIEW ABOUT WHAT THE WHAT THE RESPONSE IS THE ECONOMY NEEDS RIGHT NOW SITTING HERE THIS MORNING I WAS A POLITICAL STATE BUT HE'S A FISCAL STIMULUS NEEDED THAT SO I MEAN IF YOUR TALK IF YOU'RE DESCRIBING AT A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY THEN YOU KNOW ONE WOULD ASSUME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING HAVE YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER I THINK LOOK I'M GOING TO BE SITTING DOWN WITH THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND IN LESS THAN AN HOUR AND WITH THE OTHER
EXPERTS AND LEADING PLAYERS IN THE ECONOMY DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY JUST TO TAKE STOCK BUT MY INITIAL JUDGEMENT IS THAT THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY HAS COME FROM BUSINESSES
CAUSING DECISIONS THAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE TAKEN INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND I THINK THE MOST URGENT THING WE NEED TO DO IS SEND A SIGNAL TO BUSINESS ABOUT OUR INTENTIONS AND A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO TAKING THIS AGENDA FORWARD NOW SO THAT AS WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE DO SO IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE BRITISH ECONOMY AND ENSURES THAT BRITAIN WILL REMAIN AN ATTRACTIVE DESTINATION FOR INVESTORS COMING HERE FROM OVERSEAS
MAINTAINING THAT FLOW OF INVESTMENT WHICH HAS BEEN CREATING THAT TWO AND A HALF MILLION JOBS THAT WE'VE CREATED IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN YOU WERE A KEY ARCHITECT OF THE AUSTERITY PLAN YOU WORKED CLOSELY WITH GEORGE OSBORNE BEFORE TWENTY TEN AS HIS SHADOW CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY TO JOB YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAD IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE LIB DEMS AND THE COALITION
DO YOU STILL BELIEVE IN ELIMINATING THE DEFICIT AND IF SO BY WHEN
WHAT WE DID IN TWENTY TEN WAS EXACTLY THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE THE BRITISH ECONOMY THEN AND WE'VE MADE ENORMOUS PROGRESS BY REDUCING THE DEFICIT BY TWO THIRDS RE CAPITALISING BRITAIN'S MAJOR BANKS CREATING TWO AND A HALF MILLION JOBS GETTING THIS ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN WE ARE IN AN IMMEASURABLY STRONGER POSITION TODAY THAN WE WERE IN TWENTY TEN BUT NOW WE ARE ENTERING
A NEW FACE IN THE STORY OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY WITH THE DECISION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION OUR ECONOMY WILL CHANGE AS WE GO FORWARD IN THE FUTURE AND IT WILL REQUIRE
A DIFFERENT SET OF PARAMETERS SEAL HAD UNTIL IT WAS ONE THIRD OF THE DEPTH THAT THAT STILL THERE THEN WE'VE GOT OF COURSE WE'VE GOT TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT BY WHEN FURTHER BUT LOOKING AT HOW AND WHEN AND AT WHAT PACE WE DO THAT AND HOW WE MEASURE
OUR PROGRESS IN DOING THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NOW NEED TO CONSIDER IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE ECONOMY IS FACING SO AT A KEY BUT THE THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THERE OVER THERE THE IN THE IMMEDIATE PERIOD FROM NOW IS THE E.U. NEGOTIATION THE EXIT FROM FROM THE E. UNA YOU SAID RECENTLY THAT YOU THOUGHT FINALISING A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REST OF THE E.U. COULD TAKE LONGER THAN THE SECOND WORLD WAR
TO YOUR NEGOTIATION PERIOD AND POTENTIALLY FOUR YEARS ON TOP OF THAT DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT SO WHAT I WAS DOING WAS RESPONDING TO A QUESTION IN PARLIAMENT ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR RATIFYING ANY NEW TREATY THAT BRITAIN ENTERS INTO WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AS WE LEAVE AND THAT WILL HAVE TO BE RATIFIED ALMOST CERTAINLY BY NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS ACROSS TWENTY SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES AND THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME BUT LOOK
THE IMPORTANT POINT IS NOT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO RATIFY THE DETAILED TREATY IT'S HOW LONG IT TAKES US TO GET TO AN AGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT THE PRINCIPAL TERMS OF THAT DEAL
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN DO THAT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER SO THAT PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUSINESSES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE TRADING RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO BE BETWEEN BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT IS DAMAGING OUR ECONOMY TODAY RIGHT NOW IT'S UNCERTAINTY FOR BUSINESSES THAT WANT TO GO AHEAD INVESTING IN NEW EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY BUILDING NEW FACTORIES CREATING NEW JOBS THEY WANT TO KNOW
ON WHAT TERMS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SELL INTO THE SINGLE MARKET OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ONCE BRITAIN IS OUTSIDE THAT YOU WELL ON THAT NOTE I WANT TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU OF WHERE YOU STAND ON A FEW QUICK ISSUES AND IN SUCCESSION ONE THE CITY OF LONDON AND WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO JOBS IN THE CITY OF LONDON HOW ARE YOU GOING TO STOP PARIS FRANKFURT FOR EXAMPLE ALLURING JOBS AWAY FROM THE CITY
IN THE IN THE SHORT TERM THE CITY OF LONDON IS HIGHLY RESILIENT IT'S A VERY COMPLEX WEB
OF MARKETS AND SUPPORTING INDUSTRIES LEGAL SERVICES BUSINESS SERVICES IT ISN'T SO EASY FOR ANYWHERE ELSE TO SET ITSELF UP AS A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE TO THE DENSITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT SERVICE IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE'VE GOT CITY OF LONDON BUT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WE
I HAVE VERY CLEARLY IN OUR MINDS THE NEED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO EUROPEAN UNION SINGLE MARKET FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN LONDON AND I JUST SAY THIS IS NOT ONLY IN LONDON'S INTEREST IT'S IN THE INTERESTS
OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS WELL LONDON PROVIDES A CRUCIAL
ICH ECONOMIC SUPPORT SERVICE TO THE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANIES OF MANY MANY EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES AND THEY WOULD BE IMMEASURABLY POORER IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES JUST BRIEFLY A THOUGHT ON ON TO TWO THINGS THAT ARE IN THE OFFING OR MAYBE IN THE OFFING HEATHROW EXPANSION WILL IT HAPPEN UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT HINKLEY POINT WILL HAPPEN AT ALL
ON THE DECISION ABOUT THE LOCATION OF LONDON'S THIRD AT LONDON'S ADDITIONAL RUNWAY THAT WILL BE A DECISION NOW FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO MAKE A LITTLE HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION COLLECTIVELY THROW WILL HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT YET A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE AND WE WILL BE SITTING DOWN TO LOOK AT THE OUTPUT I WANT I WANT TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE OF THE ADDITIONAL WORK THAT THE TRANSPORT SECRETARY
ORDERED EARLIER THIS YEAR WHICH HAS BEEN DONE AT HINKLEY POINT AND HINDI BUT LOOK WE NEED TO REPLACE BRITAIN'S AGEING POWER GENERATION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S A CHALLENGE WE FACE BECAUSE THE THE BLAIR AND BROWN GOVERNMENTS FAILED
TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE HINKLEY POINT PROJECT GOING AHEAD WE WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO OUR CHINESE AND FRENCH PARTNERS IN THAT PROJECT OBVIOUSLY
AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNCERTAINTY HAS BEEN CREATED BY THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW THE NEW GOVERNMENT IS NOW IN PLACE THAT WILL BE ENGAGED WITH THOSE PARTNERS AGAIN FROM TODAY I HOPE WILL BE ABLE TO DO WE'RE GOING TO BUY TO A CONCLUSION VERY SOON BUT AT WHAT COST HAS BEEN REPORTED TODAY THAT THAT THE COST OF THE NEW REACTOR AT HINKLEY POINT COULD REACH NEARLY THIRTY BILLION POUNDS
WELL I HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE REPORTS AND I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THOSE FIGURES YET BUT I DID I OBVIOUSLY I WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE AT THAT PRICE DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO APPROACH THIS ON THE BASIS THAT
POWER GENERATION BEING ABLE TO DELIVER A RELIABLE POWER SUPPLY IS AN ABSOLUTE PREREQUISITE FOR A MODERN DYNAMIC FUNCTIONING
ECONOMY AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO GENERATE THE POWER THAT'S NEEDED FOR THE U.K. GRINNED HINKLEY POINT WILL MAKE A HUGE CONTRIBUTION SIX PER CENT OF OUR TOTAL POWER GENERATION CAPACITY AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROJECT GOES AHEAD
FINALLY HOW IS THIS NEW CABINET GOING TO WORK LOOKING AT THE APPOINTMENT SO FAR YOU'VE GOT AMBER ARRIVED AT THE HOME OFFICE IN CHARGE OF M.I.FIVE AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE YOU'VE GOT BORIS JOHNSON IN CHARGE OF M.I.SIX AND THIS IS A MAN WHO AMBER RUDD SAID SHE WOULDN'T TRUST TO DRIVE HER HOME FROM A PARTY AT THE END OF THE EVENING AND HE'S OVERSEEING THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE G.C.H.Q.
AND YOU SEE IT HERE SHOULD I MEAN THE CABINET WORKS COLLECTIVELY WE'VE GOT A RANGE OF DIFFERENT CHARACTERS AND A RANGE OF DIFFERENT STYLES AND A RANGE OF DIFFERENT TALENTS AND THAT'S WHAT GIVES A CABINET IT'S STRENGTH THE LEAD IN THE TONE WILL BE SET BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE FOREIGN OFFICE THE HOME OFFICE THE TREASURY ARE ALL
WELL OILED MACHINES WITH HIGHLY SKILLED AND COMPETENT CIVIL SERVANTS LEADING THEM AND ANY NEW MINISTER AS I AM TODAY AS BORIS JOHNSON IS IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE IS AMBER RUDD IS IN THE HOME OFFICE GOING INTO A GREAT DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT
FROM SENIOR OFFICIALS AROUND THEM THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CONTINUITY OF THAT KEEPS THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT RUNNING AND I THINK PEOPLE CAN BE ASSURED OF THAT AS WE MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM ONE SECRETARY OF STATE TO ANOTHER THERE IS VERY STRONG CONTINUITY PROVIDED BY OUR VERY HIGH CALIBRE OFFICIALS
PHILIP HAMMOND CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT ON A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG WAS LISTENING NEW PHASE FOR THE ECONOMY LAURA THAT'S WHAT THE MAN SAYS
INDEED HE DID HE SAID THE ECONOMY WILL CHANGE AND THAT TO QUOTE HIM REQUIRES A DIFFERENT SETTLES PARAMETERS I THINK THERESA MAY ALREADY SAID THAT SHE WOULD RELAX DROP THEIR GOAL OF PAYING OFF THE DEFICIT BY TWENTY TWENTY QUITE CLEARLY THIS NEW GOVERNMENT IS OPEN TO TAKING A DIFFERENT
APPROACH GEORGE OSBORNE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PRETTY RUTHLESSLY TOLD THAT HIS SERVICES ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED BUT ALSO HE'S PHILIP HAMMOND IN THE GOVERNMENT WITH A BIT OF AN AWKWARD PROBLEM ON THIS QUESTION OF THE EMERGENCY BUDGET THAT HE SAID HE'D HAVE TO DO IF WE LASSIE YOU JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THEY WILL NOT BE AN EMERGENCY BUDGET THAT WAS MADE CLEAR BY AN APPARENT THE AUTUMN STATEMENT IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST BIG OCCASION
IT'S CLEAR FROM PHILIP HAMMOND THEY WANT A PERIOD OF CALM HE HOPE IS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR DECISIONS WHEN THEY SEE FIT
WITH THE PRESSURES AND DEMANDS OF GOVERNMENT DON'T ALWAYS MAKE THAT POSSIBLE BUT YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A MESSAGE FROM HIM THIS MORNING ON ALMOST EVERY ISSUE WAS I WILL NOT BE RUSHED WE WILL NOT BE RUSHED WHETHER ON THE E.U. DEAL ECONOMIC DECISIONS OR ANYTHING ELSE BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THE HOPE AND EXPECTATION AMONG SENIOR MINISTERS IS OF COURSE THAT SOME OF THE VERY BIG PIECES CAN BE DISCUSSED VERY SOON FOR EXAMPLE HE'S SEEN THE GOVERNMENT BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY TODAY
AND INDEED ON THE E.U. PHILIP HAMMOND ALREADY SAID A FEW DECADES AGO INFORMAL TORROX MIGHT BE ABLE TO START EXTREMELY SOON
SOME ISSUES PERHAPS OVER WHAT HAPPENS TO IAN YOU NATIONALS HERE AND BRITS ABROAD A DEAL AND AN UNDERSTANDING COULD BE REACHED VERY QUICKLY BEFORE WE PLUNGE INTO DETAILED NEGOTIATIONS HOWEVER THEY ARE GOING TO WORK WITH ALL THESE NEW DEPARTMENTS ARE NEW FIGURES WELL EXACTLY AND HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND LAURA WHAT IS THAT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR GOING TO BE BETWEEN BORIS JOHNSON THE FOREIGN SECRETARY DAVID DAVIES THE BRECK SAID
SECRETARY WHO WE WERE TALKING TO THE FORMER PERMANENT SECRETARY THE FOREIGN OFFICE DID HALF AN HOUR OR SO AGO WERE SAYING THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO COMPLETELY SEPARATE MINISTRY IN A SEPARATE BUILDING WITH A SEPARATE SET UP ITS OWN PERMANENT SECRETARY HOW DOES ALL THAT WORK
STRAIGHT UP JUST AND THE ANSWER IS NOBODY QUITE KNOWS YET IT'S JUST NOT CLEAR HOW THESE THREE DIFFERENT BITS OF THE JIGSAW ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER YES IT'S CLEAR THEY WILL BE DISTINCT DEPARTMENTS WHERE WHETHER THEY END UP ACTUALLY IN DIFFERENT BUILDINGS OR NOT WHO KNOWS YOU KNOW IT'S QUITE COMMON IN WHITEHALL THESE DAYS ACTUALLY DO YOU HAVE ONE ARM AND A SMALLER ONE TUCKED AWAY IN THE BOWELS OF ANOTHER THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS UNUSUAL BUT CLEARLY WITH THOSE
THREE MEN WHO ALL I HAVE TO SAY ARE NOT KNOWN AS TERRIBLY EASY PEOPLE TO PLACATE SHALL WE SAY ONE OF THESE SUGGESTIONS ONE OF THE THINGS IS HOW ARE THEY GOING TO PULL AGAINST EACH OTHER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DAVID DAVIES IS IN A MEETING ROOM IN BRUSSELS TALKING ABOUT THE LATEST PHASE OF THE NEGOTIATION WAS IT YOU'LL HAVE TO PHONE BORIS JOHNSON BEFORE HE'S ABLE TO SEE SOMETHING TO HIS FELLOW MINISTERS AROUND THE TABLE IS LIAM
GOING TO BE ON THE OTHER LINE SAY NOW YOU CAN'T PROMISE THIS UNTIL I'VE SORTED OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CHINA WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW THAT TRIO ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AND IT'S IT'S LIKELY IN THE MANNER OF THESE THINGS IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF TENSION BETWEEN ALL OF THEM WHAT I WOULD SAY THOUGH IS IF YOU THINK OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE YOU KNOW THERE IS A SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW BORIS JOHNSON'S JOB MIGHT BE MUCH DIMINISHED BECAUSE SO MUCH OF IT HAS GONE OVER TO DAVID DAVIS'S DEPARTMENT OR WHATEVER
THE WHOLE SUITE IF YOU LIKE THAT WHOLE POLICY AREA HAS JUST HAD AN ENORMOUS DOUBLING TREBLING QUADRUPLING WHATEVER IN ITS WORKLOAD WITH WHAT HE'S GOING TO GO ON WITH US LIVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SO WHATEVER THE ACTUAL PECKING ORDER IS GOING TO BE PLENTY OF WORK FOR ALL OF THEM TO DO IT ALTHOUGH OF COURSE IN WESTMINSTER THERE WILL BE A LOT OF GUESSING GAMES ENTIRELY BUT OF SPECULATION OVER WHO OUT OF THE THREE OF THEM
IS REALLY THE BOSS I JUST FINALLY LAURA WE'RE EXPECTING MORE NAMES MORE IMPORTANT CABINET NAMES THIS MORNING BUT NOT NOT FOR AN HOUR TO UNDERSTAND EDDIE DIEM AND THEN THE OBVIOUS QUESTIONS IS THIS THIS QUESTION OF OF THE PROMOTION OF WOMEN ISN'T IT WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING WE'VE HAD AN AMBER RUB THEN SHE WAS TAKING OVER A DEPARTMENT WHERE THERESA MAY ALREADY WAS MEANT NO CAN A NET GAIN AS IT WERE WERE WHAT WHERE WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING THIS MORNING
INDEED DON'T FORGET THOUGH THAT THE PRIME MINISTER IS A WOMAN DON'T FORGET ALSO THAT THERESA MAY IS NOT THE KIND OF POLITICIAN WHO WILL GIVE SOMEBODY A JOB BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER I MEAN LET'S BE COMPLETELY CLEAR ABOUT THAT SHE'S JUST NOT THAT KIND OF POLITICIAN CERTAIN SHE'S ALWAYS WORKED HARD TO TRY TO PROMOTE WOMEN COMING INTO PARLIAMENT TO TRY TO BUILD UP THE NUMBERS ON THE TORY BENCHES OF WOMEN COMING INTO THE PARTY
BUT IN TERMS OF THE NEXT LOT OF APPOINTMENTS I THINK WE WILL SEE THEIR FEMALE NAMES COMING IN THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT MAYBE JUSTINE GREENING PROBABLY A JOB FOR ANDREA LEAD SOME BUT ONE OF THE BIG DILEMMAS IS WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL GO DOES HE GET KEPT IN HIS JOB OR NOT FROM ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THE NEXT LOT OF NAMES SHOULD START EMERGING BANKS IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND A SPORTS NEWS THIS MORNING COMES FROM ROYAL TROON CARTY AS THEIR MORNING CARTY

THIS IS AN UNUSUAL EVENT IN INDIA AS A CELEBRATION OF THE INCREDIBLE SACRIFICE MADE BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIAN SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR THE ORGANISERS HOPE IT WILL MARK THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA OF REMEMBRANCE HERE IN INDIA I'M JOINED BY THE MAN WHO'D LED THE EFFORT SQUADRON LEADER RANA TUNA SO WHY ARE YOU LAUNCHING THIS TODAY
TODAY MARKS THE CENTENARY OF MAJOR CAVALRY CHARGE IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY AN INDIAN CAMPION BRIGADE DURING THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME AND WE HAD THE DRAGOON GUARDS AS WELL AS THE TWENTY THIRD HE CAN ALWAYS TAKE PART IN THE CHARGE IN THE WESTERN FRONT AND AS EXPECTED
REALLY SIGNIFICANT CASUALTIES SO THIS DAY WAS CHOSEN SPECIFICALLY TO MARK THAT OCCASION AND THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THE NUMBER OF INDIAN LIVES LOST IN BOTH THE FIRST AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR ARE REALLY QUITE STAGGERING REMIND US OF THOSE FIGURES
WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD A VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INDIANS FOR BOTH THE WORLD WAS AMOUNTING TO A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND AND IN WORLD WAR TWO I SHOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE INDIAN ARMY WAS THE LARGEST ONE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN CONFLICT AND NUMBERING OVER TWO POINT FIVE MILLION
AND SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND DIED IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR WHICH OF COURSE THAT THE CENTURY OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME IS THIS MONTH WHY HASN'T INDIA TENDED TO COMMEMORATE THIS INCREDIBLE SACRIFICE SO MANY INDIANS MADE
WHERE THEY'RE AT IT LARGELY I THINK BOYS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT FOR MANY YEARS AFTER INDEPENDENCE THESE METALS WERE SEEN AS BEING PART OF A COLONIAL LEGACY AND THEREFORE SOMETHING THAT WASN'T REALLY PART OF OUR HISTORY BUT I THINK WE ARE NOW AT THAT POSITION WHERE WE CAN RECLAIM PART OF OF PAST AND ARE COMMEMORATED
AND YOU THINK INDIAN PETE THE INDIAN PEOPLE WILL BE KEEN TO DO THIS COS YOU'VE LAUNCHED ON A PROJECT HAVING YOU INDIA REMEMBERS WHAT WHAT DOES INDIANS INDIA REMEMBERS ALL ABOUT THAT THE PROJECT OF COURSE SEEKS TO ENGAGE WITH CIVIL SOCIETY AT LARGE IN THE ARMED FORCES OF COURSE HOLIDAY HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT TRADITION OF REMEMBRANCE
WE DON'T INTEND TO PREACH THE CONVERTED BUT BUT ACTUALLY HOPEFULLY CREATE A GROUNDSWELL CULTURE OF REMEMBRANCE WITHIN INDIAN SOCIETY AND THE PROJECT THEREFORE IS AIMING TO ENGAGE WITH THE YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC TO ACHIEVE THIS I JUST VERY BRIEFLY WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES SOLDIERS HAVE MADE ON OUR BEHALF
WHEN I DO THINK THERE'S A FAMOUS SAYING THAT SAYS IF YOU DON'T LEARN FROM THE LESSONS OF HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT THEM AND SIMILARLY I THINK IF YOU DO NOT REMEMBER THE PAST ARE COUNTRY BUT DOESN'T DO THAT AS LIKELY NOT TRAVEL TO
SO I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO'VE FOUGHT AND DIED IN THESE TWO IN THE WARDS SO WANTS MY SQUADRON RUNNER TRAINER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR PROJECT THANK YOU
# JUSTIN THANK YOU OUR SOUTH ASIA CORRESPONDENT JUSTIN ROAD UP THEIR SIXTY MINUTES TO NINE UP TO TEN THOUSAND POLICE AND SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO STOP MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES CROSSING THE RAZOR WIRE FENCE ALONG HUNGRY SOUTHERN BORDER WITH SERBIA A NEW LAW CAME INTO FORCE LAST WEEK ALLOWS THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES TO PUSH THOSE CAUGHT ILLEGALLY ON THEIR TERRITORY BACK INTO SERBIA
CAUSED A NEW BUILD UP OF FOR MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ARE VERY POOR CONDITIONS ON THE SERBIAN SIDE OF THE FENCE BESIDE TO TRANSIT ZONES WHERE THE HUNGARIANS ARE ALLOWING HIM JUST TWO HUNDRED MIGRANTS A WEEK NEXT THOUGHT IS THERE AN ASCENT THIS
IT'S MID MORNING AT THE MAKESHIFT REFUGEE CAMP RIGHT UP AGAINST THE TRANSIT ZONE AT THE HUNGARIAN BORDER FENCE HERE AT WATER GOSH
MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN MOSTLY FROM AFGHANISTAN WHILE QUEUING TO WASH THEMSELVES WAFFLING CONTAINERS FROM TWO TAPS
HELLO GEORGIA RICH FROM DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS TOLD ME THE MEDICAL PROBLEMS HE ENCOUNTERS EVERY DAY
OR HYGIENE WORE A DIET THAT'S WELL LIMITED AXIS TO GREEN
MOST OF THE LAND IS DRY AND SANDY AS YOU CAN SEE AND TEMPERATURES HERE CAN ARISE LIKE SUB SAHARAN TEMPERATURES SO ALL DEPTH CONTRIBUTES TO INCREASE SEEM OPERAS BRITA ATTACK HIS INFECTION'S THOUGH
BUT HE AND HIS TEAM ARE ALSO TREATING NEW INJURIES HE SAYS ALLEGEDLY INFLICTED BY HUNGARIAN POLICE AND SOLDIERS WHO CATCH MIGRANTS WHO ILLEGALLY CROSS FOR FRIENDS WE CAN WITNESS
THIS IS ALL I'VE GOT DRAMA DEATH CAN BE RELATED GREEN EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
AND FROM THE DUST AND ONES THAT WE COLLECTED FROM THE REFUGES WE EVIDENCE THAT THIS YOU'VE BEEN MISTREATED IN SOME WAY FROM A HUNGARIAN PULLEYS
OOZES CUTS DOG BITES STICKS AND SHAPED BRUISES ON THE BODY'S SAMI ACROSS TWICE I'M ALLEGES THAT HE WAS MISTREATED BY THE POLICE BOTH TIMES
I'VE GOT THE POISED AND THEY'RE PRETTY SPREAD BY THE POLICE THE HUNGARIAN PLEASE POPEYE JINGLE YOU KICKING ME AND BE AWAY FROM ME THE STEAKS YOU KNOW THE POLICE STEAKS WELL LET HIM BE AT THE B. AND B. IN PEOPLE
THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES SAY THEY SIMPLY ESCORT MIGRANT BACK TO SERBIA AND THAT BY DOING SO THEY'RE PROTECTING THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND THE WHOLE YOU FROM IRREGULAR IMMIGRANTS
SO THE ONLY WAY INTO HUNGARY NOW IS LEGALLY ONE BY ONE THROUGH THE TRANSIT
IT'S AROUND ELEVEN IN THE MORNING NOW AND TODAY'S FIFTEEN LUCKY ONES ARE BEING ALLOWED THROUGH A HEAVILY GUARDED METAL TURNSTILE INTO THE TRANSIT ZONE TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM
THE SPOKESMAN OF THE U.N. REFUGEE AGENCY IN HUNGARY AND SHE ONE SAYS THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES SHOULD ADMIT FINE MORE THIS IS VERY RADICAL
ADVOCATE FOR MORE BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE FORCED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SPANS REEKS OR EVEN MORE THAN ONE MONTH IN THESE SUBHUMAN CIRCUMSTANCE
THESE PEOPLE THESE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WE WANT TO FOLLOW THE RULES FOR ONCE OR BE AUTHORITIES AND DON'T WANT TO FORMALLY OFFER SURELY SUDDENLY DID
MANY PEOPLE I SPOKE TO IN THE CAMP SAY THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THE DANGERS OF THE JOURNEY AND WILL WAIT PATIENTLY HERE FOR THEIR NAMES TO BE CALLED FROM A LIST WHICH GETS LONGER EVERY DAY

# NICK THORPE REPORTING THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE IT IS TWO YEARS SINCE MARLENE ALI BECAME ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNISABLE FACES IN ENGLISH CRICKET BOTH BECAUSE OF HIS ABILITY AS AN ALL ROUNDER AND BECAUSE OF HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOK THE BEARD THAT'S FEARED OR SOME CALLED HIM TODAY HE'S PART OF AN ENGLAND TEAM PLAYING IN THE FIRST INVEST TECH TEST AGAINST PAKISTAN THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH HIS FAMILY CAME TO THE U.K. WHEN WE MET AT LORDS I ASKED HIM WHAT THAT WILL BE LIKE
I THINK IT'S VERY VERY EXCITING IT'S DIFFERENT TO OTHER SERIOUS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN
MY GRANDAD WAS ON SMOTHERS AWESOMENESS OR IT'S VERY SPECIAL FOR ME AND I WANT A LOT OF FAMILY COME OVER AND SAY NURSE CAN BE TOUGH TO FOR YOU GUYS BUT I CAN'T
I FEEL TORN BETWEEN ENGLAND
UNTIL THEY WERE AS A KID AND NEVER HAVE
DAD'S MOTHER'S FROM ENGLAND SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY
SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN QUITE CROSS WITH HER ALWAYS
BUT FOR ENGLAND AND IT WAS SPECIAL TO ME BECAUSE WHEN I GO THERE AND I'VE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME I KNOW IT'S A LAND WHERE MY MOTHER WAS BORN
I'M GOING TO FIND THAT ARE SPECIAL BUT APART FROM THAT THAT'S IT REALLY
HER GRASP OF THE LANGUAGE DON'T YOU BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN IN THE PAST WHEN ENGLAND PLAY PAKISTAN YOU'VE USED YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF OR TO ITS DETRIMENT I KNOW THERE ARE QUITE A BIT ACTUALLY
IN THE INNER ORDERS WERE A SIMILAR WHAT'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT SMELLS YOUNGER AND STUFF AND I PICKED IT UP FROM THERE BUT MY MOTHER
THE SPEAKER ON THE KASHMIRI LANGUAGE LANGUAGE SO QUITE WARM AND ALMOST A LIFT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU
TOLD ALISTAIR COOKE WAS WHAT THE WHAT THE OTHER SIDE WERE SAYING ON THE FIELD OBVIOUSLY THEY COULD BE SAYING THE WRONG THING BUT MY SPOT ON THIS WHEN THEY SPEAK I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IF THE TROUBLE WHY DO IT STUFF AND THAT KIND OF
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT
YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO TO THIS TEST I CAN'T WORK VERY EXCITED I THINK THE QUALITY OF THE CRICKETS COULD BE QUITE HIGH UP ON BOTH TEAMS HAVE A LOT OF GOOD PLAYERS AND SORT OF
BECAUSE IF YOUR CRICKETING SUCCESS YOU TODAY ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN AND HIGHEST PROFILE BRITISH MUST
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU IT'S ALL RIGHT I WAS SPEAKING TO A FRIEND ACTUALLY YESTERDAY AND HE WAS TELLING ME IT'S A BIG RESPONSIBILITY AND THINGS LIKE THAT
LET US JUST HAVE MUSLIM PLAY CRICKET
PLAYING FOR ENGLAND PLAYING FOR THEIR COUNTRY FAWNING THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I DON'T SEE I THINK IN THE BACK OF MY MIND IT WAS HER RESPONSIBILITY
REPRESENTING MUSLIMS AND ISLAM AND BRITISH ASIANS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT IT'S A POSITIVE THING AS LONG AS I CAN PERFORM
WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND I CAN BEHAVE MYSELF
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME BEFORE THE PERFORMANCES TO BE A GOOD PERSON TO PEOPLE ELEVEN HAVE A POSITIVE
IN CRICKET HOW IMPORTANT IS YOUR FAITH TO YOU THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I FEEL LIKE MAKES ME FEEL FREE I CAN BE LOWER AND IT'S EXACTLY WHERE I WANT TO BE
IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT I FEEL CAN GIVE ME HAPPINESS OR NINE TONNES OF ANYTHING BUT CRICKET THIS IS IMPORTANT BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS IMPORTANT AS MY RELIGION IF I DEFACE CRICKET
THIS IS IT AND HOW HAVE YOU COPED WITH THE ATTENTION ON YOU IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
YOUR POSITION IN THE ENGLAND TEAM IS STAND OUT BEING MUSLIM PLAYING FOR ENGLAND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN LIKE IT'S BEEN GOOD
DON'T PAY FOR LIKE THAT AND YOU GO TO RESTAURANTS AND STUFF WHICH IS
WITH MY FAMILY AND PEOPLE I TAKE A PICTURE
I THOUGHT PART OF BEING INTERNATIONAL CRICKETER YOU'RE CERTAIN THERE'S GOOD THINGS AND THERE'S NOT SO GOOD BUT WILL SEE DISCO
US AND AFTER THE REFERENDUM IF IN SOME WORRYING SIGNS ABOUT INCREASING THEY CRY
DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT CLIMATE FOR MINORITY COMMUNITY
THE STUFF I MEAN I THINK CERTAIN COMMUNITIES
IT'S TOUGHER FOR FOUR PEOPLE AND US OBVIOUSLY THE STORIES YOU HEAR ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING A LITTLE BIT ALL OVER US BUT IT WAS TOUGH AND IT DOES FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE ON YOUR GUARD ALMOST A LITTLE BIT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DISAPPOINTED I THINK OBVIOUSLY
STUFF BUT FOR ME IT'S A PART OF LIFE SOMETIMES AND HE'S JUST GOING TO HOPEFULLY GET THROUGH THE ROUGH BIT
YOU SEE A LIGHT AT THE END OF IT AND IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT GOOD LUCK FOR THE TEST MATCH AND THANK YOU NO PROBLEM THANK YOU
# THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE WE HAVE LEARNT A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THERESA MAY'S NEW GOVERNMENT THIS MORNING WE HAD OF COURSE FROM PHILIP HAMMOND CHANCELLOR WE KNOW AS WELL ABOUT THE APPOINTMENT OF BORIS JOHNSON'S A FOREIGN SECRETARY AND THERE'S BEEN REACTION TO THAT RIGHT AROUND THE WORLD LET'S TALK
TO DANNY FINKELSTEIN LAW FINKELSTEIN THE TIMES POLITICAL CALMNESS AND TO MARY RIDDELL AS WELL HIS IMPERIAL COMMUNIST ON THE TELEGRAPH MORNING TO YOU BOTH MADE FIRST OF ALL THAT
NEW CHANCELLOR HE WAS AN INTERESTING PHRASE AS ONE OF THE ECONOMY HE SAID HE'S IN A NEW PHASE WHAT DO YOU THINK HE MEANS BY THAT WELL I'M IN PHILIP HAMMOND REPUTATION IS IS THAT OF A HAWK SO WE WHAT WE MIGHT EXPECT OR FEAR THAT IS
PERHAPS AN EVEN MORE AUSTERE PHASE THAN IT WAS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT REALLY TO SEE HOW HOW THIS CAN BE AT ALL A BRIGHT OR A BOOMING TIME FOR THE ECONOMY IT MAY BE THAT HE'S JUST PLAYING FOR TIME TO SEE HOW THINGS HOW HOW THINGS PAN OUT BUT I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY WE SHOULD WE SHOULD ASCRIBE TO MUCH HOPE AND OPTIMISM TO HIS INITIAL COMMENT DANNY FINKELSTEIN
DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE BEEN A SLOWING DOWN IN GROWTH YOU CAN TELL THAT BY TALKING TO ANYONE IN BUSINESS THAT'S CAUSED BY UNCERTAINTY AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THE BRICKS AT HYPOTHESIS WHICH IS THAT IN THE LONG RUN WILL GET GREATER GROWTH BY TAKING CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE OF A TRADING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ONE THAT WOULD PRODUCE MORE GROWTH IN THE SHORT TIME IT WERE ALWAYS PRODUCED MORE UNCERTAINTY IN THE SHORT RUN SO YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN I THINK THERE'S A FEELING THAT IT MAY BE MORE SEVERE THAN PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAD FELT IT WOULD BE
SO HE'S HE'S PREPARING THE WAY IN WHAT HE SAID TO US THIS MORNING FOR SOME KIND OF LOOSENING ISN'T HE HAVE OF HIS FISCAL STANCE IN THAT THERE'S NOT CLEARLY WHAT ABOUT DON'T IT IS
I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY LONGER POSSIBLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE BUT SURPLUS BECAUSE THAT REQUIRED THE ECONOMY TO KEEP GROWING AS IT HAD DONE UNDER THE PREVIOUS CHANCELLOR I THINK IT WON'T DO THAT NOW FOR SOME TIME AND THEREFORE THAT IN IN THE AUTUMN STATEMENT THEY'LL HAVE TO BE A A REBALANCING OF THE ECONOMIC POLICY AND THE GOVERNMENT
HAS SOME ROOM SOME WIGGLE ROOM THAT IS CREATED BY ABANDONING THE SURPLUS ROLE BUT THAT DOESN'T CREATE MAGIC CASH SO IT WILL STILL HAVE TO IF WE GROW LESS WE'LL HAVE LESS TO SPEND YEAH BECAUSE IT WAS INTERESTING WASN'T IT MARRIED AL LISTENING TO TREES MADE YESTERDAY
THE MOOD ME AS IF I PUT IT LIKE THAT IS ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE
EAT AN AWFUL LOT WILL DEPEND WHEN I GET AN EMERGENCY BUDGET BUT WE ARE GOING TO GET A BUDGET WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE AUTUMN STATEMENT ET-CETERA LOT IS GOING TO DEPEND THE PRACTICALITIES OF PUTTING THAT INTO PRACTICE IF THEY'RE REALLY INTENDING TO PUTTING INTO PRACTICE WILL QUICKLY BECOME VERY OBVIOUS YES ABSOLUTELY IT'LL BECOME OBVIOUS ALMOST INSTANTLY AND IT'S SOMETHING TO WATCH OUT FOR WITH EVERY INCOMING PRIDE MINISTER WHERE YOU DRAW A LINE BETWEEN THE RHETORIC AND THE REALITY
THERESA MAY'S SPEECH AS YOU SUGGEST YESTERDAY JUSTIN WAS QUITE A RADICAL SPEECH ON HELPING THOSE AT THE BOTTOM SHE OF COURSE IS LARGELY STATE EDUCATED SHE'S TRYING TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO AND THEY PERHAPS RATHER MORE PRIVILEGE KATRA THAT PRECEDED HER
BUT SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT UP VERY VERY QUICKLY WITH ACTION BECAUSE THEY EAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT DANNY RIGHTLY SAYS IS A MUCH MORE SEVERE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAN LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAD HOPED FOR A GOING TO BECOME APPARENT TO ORDINARY VOTERS I THINK VERY VERY QUICKLY INDEED AND DANNY ON EUROPE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE PROMOTION OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS TO RELIEVE THE KEY ROLES
THERESA MAY HASN'T GOT A BIG MAJORITY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT SHE'S SOLIDIFIES HER LEADERSHIP BY ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BOTH IN THE PARTY AND IN THE COUNTRY BELIEVE SHE'S SERIOUS ABOUT LEAVING AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S DONE BY SELECTING THE PEOPLE THAT SHE'S SELECTED TOBY DAVIS IN MY VIEW IT IS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE ONE WHO HAS THE GREATEST GRASP OF THE DETAIL AND THE CLEAREST IDEA OF HOW HE WANTS TO NEGOTIATE
THE WAY THAT I LOOK AT HIS WORK IS IT'S A VERY INTERESTING HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THE ECONOMY AND NOW WE'VE DECIDED TO LEAVE WE'LL HAVE TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS I'VE BEEN A BIT SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE BALANCE OF THE BENEFITS AND COST MYSELF BUT I THINK OF THE GOVERNMENT HAVING DECIDED TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE HE QUITE A GOOD PERSON TO HAVE DOING THAT BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE HE HAS THOUGHT CLEARLY ABOUT IT AND IS IT ALSO A CLEVER POLITICS MARY RIDDELL THAT THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE IF IT IS TO BE A BIT OF A MESS
THE NEGOTIATING AND THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME DIFFICULT COMPROMISES PEOPLE EARN CHARGE OTHER ONES WHO WHO WANTED IT WELL WE'LL HAVE TO SEE ABOUT THAT I ADMIRE OF DAVID DAVIES I THINK HE IS A POLITICIAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY AND RICK ARE LET'S SEE WHAT HE CAN DO AS FOR BORIS JOHNSON DAVID CAMERON MAY HAVE BEEN THE FUTURE ONCE BUT BORIS HAS BEEN THE FUTURE AT LEAST TWICE OR THREE TIMES I THINK AND HERE HE IS POPPING UP AS FOREIGN SECRETARY
IT'S A GAMBLE BY THERESA MAY AND IF IT DOESN'T PAY OFF THIS PUTTING BREAKFAST IN THE HANDS OF THE BEDOUIN THE BREAK THE TEARS IT WILL REBOUND ON HER THE BOP WITH THE BUTT BUT WILL STOP WITH HER AND SO I THINK THIS IS THIS IS TRULY A GAMBLE IT'S A POTENTIALLY REALLY DIFFICULT ONE ISN'T IT DANNY BECAUSE TIME WHEN YOU LOOK AT DAVID DAVIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH BORIS JOHNSON BECAUSE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR ENTIRE DEPARTMENT AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND THERE'S NEW BRECHT'S APARTMENT WHO'S IN CHARGE
WHEN YOU SAID WHEN YOU CHOOSE A NEW GOVERNMENT YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO CREATE TENSIONS AND ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT THERE WAS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER IN THE PRIME MINISTER WHICH WAS ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED SO THE TWO OF THEM REALLY WORKED IN LOCKED STEP WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY THAT I'D HAVE BEEN OUTRIGHT TENSION AS THEY HAVE BEEN BETWEEN BLAIR AND BROWN BUT OTHERWISE JUST MORE DISTANT RELATIONSHIPS AS THEY WERE BETWEEN OTHER CHANCELLORS AND PRIME MINISTERS
YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO A MUCH MORE TRADITIONAL FORM OF THAT IN THIS GOVERNMENT SO YOU'VE GOT THERESA MAY'S RHETORIC GOING TOWARDS IN THE WAY THAT SHE SUGGESTED YOU KNOW THE PRIVILEGED VIEW BUT THEN YOU'VE ALSO GOT PHILIP HAMMOND IN CHARGE OF TAX AND BENEFITS POLICY SO YOU YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT FAULT LINES PLAY OUT AND THERE'S GOING TO BE OBVIOUSLY WHAT IS THE LINE BETWEEN DAVID DAVIS'S DEPARTMENT FOXES BUT
THE KEY THING IS THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED ON A POLICY THAT OF PURSUING WHAT THE ELECTORATE DECIDED TO DO WHICH IS TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NOW IT'S GOING TO GIVE THAT EXPRESS SHORTENED TO RES MO'S GOT TO ENSURE THAT IF IT ISN'T SUCCESSFUL THE REASON WHY IT'S NOT SUCCESSFUL AS A HYPOTHESIS IS WRONG BUT NOT WITH YOU RESIST O.K. THAT IF IT WAS FINE THANKS DAVE OUR EDITORS SARAH NELSON NICKEL A STAMP BRIDGE GOOD MORNING
