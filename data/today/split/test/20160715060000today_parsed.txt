# THANKS VERY MUCH PHIL IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX AT LEAST EIGHTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED WHEN A LORRY WAS DELIBERATELY DRIVEN INTO CROWDS DURING THE BASTILLE DAY CELEBRATIONS IN NICE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE LATE LAST NIGHT THE DRIVER'S BEEN SHOT IN THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES SAY THEY FOUND WEAPONS AND GRENADES IN HIS LORRY VIDEO FROM THE SCENE SHOWED PEOPLE RUNNING IN PANIC AND TRYING TO TAKE SHELTER
INITIALLY IN THE CHAOS IT WASN'T CLEAR WHAT WAS HAPPENING GREY SON MORROW WAS IN THE CROWD WITH HER FAMILY WHEN THE ATTACK HAPPENED I GOT SEPARATED TERRAIN AND UNCLE AND I WAS LOOKING AROUND THROUGH THEM AND WE JUST HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON A LITTLE PEAK HERE I THINK YOU'VE OVER SCREAMING KIDS ARE CRYING BUT HAVE OUR BETTER RUTT I'M SUCH A PART OF THAT EVENING IT WAS SUCH A PERIOD NO DRILL SHALL SAY WAS NEAR THE BEACH AND SAW WHAT HAPPENED SUDDENLY WE SAW A TRUCK COMING
AND WE THOUGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE FOUND THE TRUCK'S ALREADY YOU MATCH WITH THEM
IT'S RIGHT AT THE THOUGHT OF HIM IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW OF THAT TRUCK
I'M BACK
ALL OF A SWORD BUT IT'S AN EXCELLENT MAN HE LOVED
WHAT ARE YOU SO MEAN AND BE SCREAMED AT ME IT WAS DIP AWAY IT'S ANOTHER EYE WITNESS KEVIN HARRIS SAW THE EVENT UNFOLDING ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR OF A NEARBY HOTEL I'VE HEARD A LOT OF SCREAMING AND SHOUTING I CAME OUT OF WHAT I WRIT AND IN FRONT OF ME
LYING ON THE ROAD I SPOKE TO MIKE MY NEIGHBOUR ON THE BALCONY NEXT DOOR HE SAID THAT WHY
JOIN THE DEAD ON THE FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER BERNARD CHASM NERVE HAS BEEN VISITING THE SCENE OF THE ATTACK IN THESE LIVED IN ALDOUS HAD CLOSER DO YOU WHAT IF SO MORAL THE DEATH TOLL FROM THIS TRAGEDY IS EXTREMELY HIGH EIGHTY PEOPLE DEAD EIGHTEEN THEN CRITICAL CONDITION NUMEROUS PEOPLE INJURED
WE THINK AGAIN OF THE FAMILIES OF THESE VICTIMS THOSE WHO ARE TODAY PLUNGED INTO GRIEF BUT ALSO THE OTHER CITIZENS OF MISS WHO ARE THE SEASONING PROFOUNDLY TRAUMATISED AND PUSHED INTO ANXIETY
WHICH IS THE HE BROUGHT IT ON EGGY TUDOR LET'S TURN AT ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX TO THE PAPERS SEVERAL OF WHICH MANSION THERE LATER ADDITIONS TO COVER WHAT'S HAPPENED IN FRANCE THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MIRROR SEVENTY FIVE KILLED BY TERRORISTS IN A TRUCK WE KNOW NOW THAT THAT DEATH TOLL HAS RISEN
AND IT HAS PICTURES OR SEVERAL OF THE PAPERS DO OF THE JUST UNBELIEVABLE SCENES OF DEVASTATION AFTERWARDS BODIES IN THE STREET COVERED IN BLANKETS IN PICTURES IN THE DAILY MIRROR AND ONE
SHOT OF A WOMAN SITTING NEXT TO A BODY COVERED BY A BLANKET SHE APPEARS TO BE ON A MOBILE PHONE SHE'S KNEELING DOWN AND
THE BACKDROP THAT SORT OF ICONIC NICE SHOT OF LIGHTS TWINKLING IN THE DISTANCE AND THE GUARDIAN AS WELL DOZENS DEAD IN NICE ATTACK AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WITH A NUMBER OF
EYEWITNESSES QUOTED ON THE FRONT PAGE INCLUDING AND JOURNALIST LOCAL JOURNALIST WHO SAID THAT THE DRIVER WAS STEERING FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO RUN DOWN THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PEOPLE
HE SAW BODIES HE SAID FLYING LIKE BOWLING PINS AS THE LORRY DROVE ON
# THE EARLY EDITIONS OF THE PAPERS NOT SURPRISINGLY ARE COVERED OVERWHELMINGLY COVER THE STORY OF YESTERDAY THE NEW APPOINTMENTS TO THERESA MAY'S CABINET THE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY MIRROR MARCH OF THE MERIT OF KRATZ AND IT'S A STEAM PICKED UP BY MANY OF THE PAPERS THE DAILY TELEGRAPHS HEADLINE MAZE STATE SCHOOL CABINET
BECAUSE IN THE WORDS OF THE PAPERS IN THE MALE MAY LOADS HER NEW TEAM WITH STATE EDUCATED MINISTERS MORE STATE EDUCATED MINISTERS THAN ANY PREVIOUS CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT
AND IT'S IN THE PAPERS MAKE THE POINT THAT SHE BRUSHED ASIDE THE DAVID CAMERON REGIME IN LESS THAN A DAY AT THE TIMES HEADLINE MAY AXES CAMERON ALLIES IN RUTHLESS CABINET CARLA'S THEY POINT OUT THAT GO MORGAN AND LET WHEN ALL SACKED IN WHAT THE MALE CAUSE THE MOST BRUTAL DAY OF CABINET SACKINGS IN MODERN HISTORY AND IT AND IT IS OF COURSE ACROSS ALL THE NEWSPAPERS AND MANY OF THE INSIDE PAGES WHAT THE NEW CABINET LOOKS LIKE AND HOW DIFFERENT IT IS FROM THE LAST ONE
# JUST A WORD FROM THE REUTERS NEWS AGENCY THAT THE ATTACKER IN NICE WAS KNOWN TO THE FRENCH POLICE IT'S BEING SUGGESTED THIS MORNING FOR COMMON LAW CRIMES AS WRITERS PUT IT BUT NOT TO THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE FROM A NICE CHAIN
# COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME BUT AT THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX WE SHOULD TURN TO ANOTHER BIG PIECE OF NEWS TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER GOING TO SCOTLAND COLIN BLAINE JOINS US ON THE LINE FROM SCOTLAND AND COLIN WITH A WITH A VIEW TO WHAT HE'S OBVIOUSLY SHE'S OBVIOUSLY GONNA MEET NICOLA STURGEON BUT DO THEY HAVE A KIND OF SENSE OF WHAT IT IS THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE TODAY OR IS IT JUST GETTING TO KNOW YOU OR WHAT I THINK IS A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK FOUR
THERESA MAY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THIS VISIT IS THAT SHE SHOWS HER COMMITMENT TO THE UNION BECAUSE YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THAT WITHIN MINUTES OF BECOMING PRIME MINISTER ON THE STEPS OF DOWNING STREET SHE SPOKE ABOUT THE UNION AS A PRECIOUS PRECIOUS BOND SHE SHE'S LAYING DOWN A MARKER THAT SHE WILL BE A DEFENDER OF THE UNION IN THE WAY THAT DAVID CAMERON HAD PROMISED TO BE HIMSELF THE OTHER SIDE OF IT OF COURSE IS THAT THEY WILL BE DISCUSSING
THE BREAD'S NEGOTIATIONS AND SCOTLAND'S VERY DIFFERENT POSITION IN THE VAULT THAT SIXTY TWO PERCENT VOTED IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN AS OPPOSED TO THIRTY EIGHT FOOT FOR LEAVING AND NICOLA STURGEON'S POSITION ON THAT IS THAT SHE IS DETERMINED TO FIND WAYS OF PROTECTING SCOTLAND'S INTERESTS SHE HOPES THAT WILL BE DONE THROUGH HAVING INFLUENCE IN THEIR BREAKS AT NEGOTIATION BUT IS THAT ENOUGH DO YOU THINK
WELL AT THIS STAGE I THINK IT IS I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHAT CHIC SHE CAN EXPECT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERE IS BEHIND WHAT NICOLA STURGEON SAYS THE IMPLICIT THREAT THAT IF IF IT ISN'T DELIVERED IF SHE DOESN'T GET SOME MEANS OF PROTECTING SCOTLAND'S INTERESTS THEN SHE CAN MOVE ON TO PRESSING FOR A SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM BUT THE STARS ARE NOT OUR LINE FOR THAT FOR THE S.N.P. AT THIS STAGE BECAUSE
THE REACTION TO BRIGGS IT HAS NOT I THINK BEEN STRONG ENOUGH IN THE OPINION POLLS IT WOULDN'T BE SOMETHING THAT NICOLA STURGEON WOULD WANT TO RISK AT THE MOMENT HOWEVER IT'S IN THE BACKGROUND AND IT DOES GO FOR LEVERAGE TO PRESS FOR CHANGE THE OTHER THING SHE'S DONE IT SHE SET UP A COUNCIL OF INDEPENDENT EXPERTS NICOLA STURGEON TO CONSIDER
THE WAYS IN WHICH SCOTLAND MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN LINKS WITH THE Y. YOU WANT THINGS LIKE TRADE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH WORKERS' RIGHTS AND IMPERSONAL TERMS OF THE TWO DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER WELL I DON'T THINK THAT BUT BUT THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY THERE IS
A POTENTIAL UPSIDE FOR BOTH OF THEM IF THEY CAN GET ON I THINK THERE IS AND THE THE EARLY COMMENTS FROM NICOLA STURGEON IN PARTICULAR WERE I THINK WARM RESPECTFUL ENCOURAGING AT CONCEDING THAT THEY DO HAVE VERY DIFFERENT POLITICAL POSITIONS
BUT SEEING THAT OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A LONG AND TRYING TO FIND COMMON GROUND TO TO PRESS AHEAD SO NO CONCESSIONS ON THE BIG POLITICAL POINTS IN ADVANCE OF COURSE BUT HER WILLINGNESS TO TRY TO WORK TOGETHER COLIN THANKS AND WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE SCOTTISH SECRETARY THERE IN MY BELL LATER ON
# IT'S SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX WELL NOW THAT TERESA MAY HAS A CABINET PLACE TRADE IS GOING TO DOMINATE THE AGENDA AT LEAST FOR THOSE WITH A BUSINESS BRIEF KATIE PRESCOTT IS HERE WITH MORE CAKE THANKS MORNING SARAH AS YOU SAY WHAT GOES ON AROUND NEGOTIATED NEGOTIATING TABLE WHAT DEALS ARE DONE AND OF COURSE ON WHAT TERMS IS REALLY GOING TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF EVERYONE'S MINDS OVER THE LONG MONTHS AHEAD TO THE ONE THING ALL BUSINESSES ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS THIS CLIMATE OF UNCERTAINTY THAT WE'RE IN THE UNKNOWN BRECHT'S THAT WORLD THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO ENTER
TO CREATE SOME SENSE PLAN BUSINESS IS BOTH HERE AND ABROAD WANT TO SEE THAT TRADE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BEING MADE AND FAST ONE ORGANISATION WITH SKIN IN THE GAME WHEN IT COMES TO U.K. TRADE IS THE COUNCIL OF BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IN EUROPE KNOWN AS COB AND DAVID THOMAS IS THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN GOOD MORNING DAVID GOOD MORNING SO YOU'RE THE UMBRELLA ORGANISATION THAT REPRESENTS BUSINESSES IN EUROPE THAT TRADE WITH BRITAIN THAT TRADE AND ALSO INVEST IN BRITAIN AND HAVE BRITISH
CAPITAL INVESTED IN THEM SO IT'S PEOPLE WHO HAVE A STAKE IN THE BRITISH RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH WITH THE E.U. AND EUROPE IN GENERAL AND THEY'RE BASED IN YEAR AND THEY'RE BASED IN EUROPE THERE
WE HAVE MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE CHAMBERS ARE NETWORK
IN MORE THAN FORTY COUNTRIES AND THESE CUNT COMPANIES ARE RANGING FROM VERY LARGE MULTINATIONALS LIKE DOWN TO SMALL ONES BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AND ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT ACTUALLY BRITISH COMPANIES
IT'S ACTUALLY SHOWS THE PUT THE BRITISH ECONOMY'S DIVERSITY IF IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM YOU THAT SIDE OF THE TABLE SO WHAT JUST DOING BUSINESS WITH THE U.K. LOOK LIKE FROM EUROPE AT THE MOMENT RIGHT AT THE MOMENT EVERYBODY'S IN KIND OF AUTOPILOT WAITING TO SEE WHAT WHAT HAPPENS OF COURSE THAT INITIALLY IT WAS FOR WHAT KIND OF GOVERNMENT IS BRITAIN GOING TO HAVE I THINK THERE'S NOW HAVING A BIT MORE CLARITY IN THAT
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FROM FROM THE EUROPEAN ASIDE THE THAT THE GOVERNMENTS IN EUROPE ALSO DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO THEY'RE NOT REALLY GIVING TOO MUCH OF A LEAVE
AND BECAUSE MOST OF THE CHAMBER NETWORKS IN EUROPE A GOVERNMENT BACKED THERE'S NOT MUCH LEAD COMING FROM THOSE CHAMBERS EITHER TWO TO THEIR LOCAL BUSINESSES AND THE LOCAL ECONOMY SO IT'S VERY MUCH DOWN TO THE TO THE BRITISH
CHAMBER NETWORK AROUND EUROPE TO ACTUALLY KEEP BUSINESS GOING AND SAYING COME ON GUYS WE CAN SEE THERE'S STILL LOTS OF BUSINESS OUT THERE AND IN FACT WE'VE WE'VE
AND TO THE VERY STRONG PROGRAMME ACROSS EUROPE NOW THROUGH THE BRITISH CHAMBERS IN IN THOSE COUNTRIES TO TO REALLY TRY TO PUT SOME CONFIDENCE BACK INTO DOING BUSINESS I WASH THIS BUSINESS IS SAYING TO YOU ON THE GROUND THAT THEY'RE SAYING
THAT NUMBER ONE THEY'D NEVER WANTED BRITAIN TO EXITS AND WE MADE THIS PLANE IN IN THE ELECTION PERIOD WE ACTUALLY DID A SURVEY THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE DID ANOTHER BIG PIECE OF WORK LAST YEAR CALLED EVOLVING BECAUSE WE ALL THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE BRITAIN
STAYING INSIDE OF EUROPE FOR THEIR REFORM AGENDA NEEDING TO BE FOLLOWED AND UNIVERSALLY EVERYBODY YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE NEED TO REFORM THE MARKET IN EUROPE
AND THEY ARE STILL HOPING THAT THE EXIT NEGOTIATIONS CAN LEAD TO A REFORM OF OF THE ECONOMY OF THE MARKET ACROSS EUROPE
MOST OF THE TIME THAT BRITAIN ACTUALLY LEAVE THE UNIT AND YOU'VE WRITTEN AN OPEN LETTER CALLING FOR YOU SAYS CERTAINTY
IN TERMS OF SPECIFICS WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE FROM GOVERNMENT WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IN WE'RE GETTING SOME SIGNALS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO TO BUSINESS FOR FOR ASSISTANCE AND FOR GUIDANCE BUT I THINK WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY TO LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT NOT JUST PURELY THE DOMESTIC CONTEXT BECAUSE THERE'S A COMMONALITY ACROSS THE WHOLE OF EUROPE ABOUT WHAT BUSINESS NEEDS
AND BUSINESSES IN EUROPE ARE NATURAL ALLIES OF THE U.K. BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE U.K. ECONOMY AND WE SHOULD UTILISE THAT LEVERAGE AND COCOA IS THAT MULTI NODAL NETWORK ACROSS EUROPE THAT ACTUALLY CAN BE USED BY GOVERNMENT
AND THE GOVERNMENTS IN EUROPE TO ACTUALLY BRING THIS CONSENSUS TOGETHER AND MOVE IT FORWARD JUST FINALLY THEN I SPOKE TO A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT THEY FELT THE U.K. WOULD BE BETTER OFF OUTSIDE THE BECAUSE IT COULD BE MORE FEET TO FETCH MUCH MORE LIVES IN ARRANGING ITS OWN TRADE DEALS
DO YOU THINK THAT COULD BE THE CASE WAS CERTAINLY THE THE E. USE THAT WAS UM
SIX MONTHS AGO THERE ARE ARGUMENTS TO SAY THAT THE ISSUE WAS AND ALWAYS IS
WHAT WAS GOING TO BE
POST IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT THAT MISTER CAMERON HAD AND IF THAT AGENDA HAD BEEN PUT FORWARD AND ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED A LOT OF THE RED TAPE AND BARRIERS THAT SMALL BUSINESS VLAD WOULDN'T DISAPPEAR
# THANK YOU VERY MUCH DAVID THOMAS EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IN EUROPE LET'S TURN TO THE MARKETS NOUN CHRIS RALPH IS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT SAINT JAMES'S PLACE GOOD MORNING CHRIS GOOD NOT A FEW HOURS AGO WE SAW CHINESE G.D.P. FIGURES SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN WE EXPECTED
YES I THINK SLIGHTLY HARD POSSIBLY NOT IN LINE WITH WITH MARKET EXPECTATIONS OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ALWAYS A TIME BIT CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE VERACITY OF DATA COMING OUT OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT BUT WHAT I THINK WE SAW IS THAT INDUSTRY AND CONSTRUCTION WAS ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY STRONGER THAN THE FIRST QUARTER UP SIX POINT ONE PERCENT THERE WERE SOME STIMULUS BY STATE FIRMS BUT ACTUALLY A LACK OF INVESTMENT BY PRIVATE COMPANIES SO WAS A BALANCING ITEM
IT'S SLIGHTLY FEELS WE'VE TAKEN OUR EYE OFF THE CHINESE BOWL AT THE MOMENT DOESN'T IT I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BUT BUT I THINK IN REALITY CHINESE WAITED PROBABLY AT A LOWER LEVEL THAN THEM THOSE FIGURES BUT GROWTH IS STABILISED HERE AND AS YOU SAY PEOPLE ARE LESS WORRIED ABOUT IT THAN THEY WERE A FEW MONTHS AGO LET'S MOVE THAT LED TO YOU KAY WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO YESTERDAY'S INTEREST RATE DECISION
I THINK SURPRISE I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN THE MARKETS WERE EXPECTING AN INTEREST RATE INCREASE I CERTAINLY WAS EXPECTING A SORRY IN INTEREST RATE CUT OF CERTAINLY EXPECTING AN INSECT I'M DEFINITELY NOT AN INCREASE BUT I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN CLEAR IS THAT THE MONK MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE HAVE STATED THAT IF THE EVIDENCE AND THEY WANT TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON EVIDENCE
AT THEIR NEXT MEETING IN AUGUST IT'S ON THE FOURTH OF AUGUST SO IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF SORT OF THREE WEEKS AGO IF THEY'RE SEEING THAT THAT CONDITIONS ARE NOT SO FAVOURABLE THAN THEY THEN THEY WILL LOOK TO TO LOWER RATES AT THAT POINT THERE WAS LATE ONE VOTE IN FAVOUR OF KEEPING RATES
LEVEL AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND ALSO NOT CHANGING THEIR SET PURCHASED REGIME LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN AUGUST AND OBVIOUSLY ON THAT DAY WE GET THE INFECTION REPORT OUT AS WELL SO HE'LL BE QUITE INTERESTING DATA POINT OBVIOUSLY SAW THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF TREES MAKES CABINET YESTERDAY WAS THERE A SENSE IN THE MARKET THAT POLITICAL STABILITY
CREATE SOME SORT OF MARKET STABILITY ARE DEFINITELY AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN THAT SINCE SINCE FOR THE FAST CHANGING POLITICAL NEWS THAT WE'VE HAD THIS WEEK FOOTSIES BEEN STRONGER STIRLING'S BEEN A BIT STRONGER IT'S REACTING TO THE FACT THAT
POLITICAL SYLLABLE STABILITY IS GOOD AND WE MIGHT SEE SOME POLICY DIRECTION OVER OVER THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS RATHER THAN IT BEING DELAYED BY TWO MONTHS THROUGH A SEWER COMPUS CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN
I THINK ACTUALLY IT'S IT'S TOO EARLY TO GET ANY FEEL FOR WHAT THE NEW LEADERS OF THE INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO SO WHETHER IT'S DAMIAN GREEN AT WORK AND PENSIONS CLERK AT THE SLIGHTLY WE ORGANISE BUSINESS DEPARTMENT WE'LL WAIT AND SEE BECAUSE RAFE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT SAINT JAMES'S PLACE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
# IF YOUR REGULAR WAKE AT QUARTER PAST SIX FOR THE BUSINESS BIT OF THE TODAY PROGRAMME CHANCES ARE YOU'VE GOT YOUR HANDS WRAPPED AROUND A CUP OF COFFEE A FRIDAY BOSS THIS WEEK MAKES HIS MONEY FROM YOU EARLY RISERS AS HE RUNS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST WELL KNOWN COFFEE COMPANIES TO SECULAR WAZZA IS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COFFEE COMPANY BY THE SAME NAME AND GREAT GRANDSON OF LUIGI THAT'S HE FOUNDED THE VATS ARE COFFEE OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS BUT IT RECENTLY BOUGHT FRENCH BRAND CUT YOU ARE OUR VERY OWN DOMINIC O'CONNELL SPOKE TO HIM AND HE ASKED IF THE COMPANY IS EXPANDING TOO QUICKLY
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE I'D SAY HE'S ALWAYS CONSIDER AND HIGH QUALITY COFFEE BIDDERS SAME TIME HE'S A PORTABLE COFFEE'S A MASS MARKET PRODUCT IS NOT FOR A MISH SO WE NEEDED TO BE HIGH QUALITY THE SAME TIME SO WE WANT TO APPROACH ALLOW AJIT RANJ OF CONSUMER WORLDWIDE SO ONE OF THE ROLE OF THE FAMILY TO KEEP UNDER CONTROL THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS THAT THE COMPANY'S GOING TO BELIEVE
SO FOR EXAMPLE THE FAME IN A MEMBER OF SAINT VERY INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS IS NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ENCRUSTED TO THEIR RESERVE CHAT AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT
SO FOR EXAMPLE MYSELF AM I TRAVELLING QUITE A LOT IN THERE THE COFFEE PRODUCING COUNTRY ALL THE FAMILY MEMBERS WITH THE COFFEE TASTING SO WE WERE REALLY LOUD TO TO SAY YES DESIS TO GIVE OUR S.S. AND TO SAY YES THIS IS A PRODUCT THIS IS LARRY
WE DON'T WE DO IT WITH THE MATS OF AERIALS AND TO KEEP OF COURSE THE QUALITY AND HIGH ELEVEN WILL LAUNCH IN FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FIRST THE THAT'S EASTERN PRODUCT THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW QUITE THERE WE ARE
BUT WE HAVE THE CHANCE OF PRESENTING A VERY HIGH QUALITY TEA EASTERN PRODUCT THIS IS THE LINE WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT PEOPLE CAN HAVE HER WHEN THEY BUY A LOT THAT'S A COFFEE I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
DO YOU EXPECT MUCH DISRUPTION TO YOUR BUSINESS FROM THIS I SPARED TO OF COURSE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND A BULLETIN ON THE MARKET THAT SHORT TERM SPEAKIN LONG TERM I DON'T KNOW
THEY CAN SAY THAT WE WANT AT ALL WE WE'RE BUSINESS AS USUAL IN U.K. THERE BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH DISCOUNT AND THERE IS STRONG WE ESTABLISH OUR SIR SIGNORINA TEAM NINETY I PERSONALLY WAS HERE WHEN WE ESTABLISHED THE COMPANY MANY A CIGAR INCHES RICO REMEMBER THE PHRASE WE WOULD BUILD THE COMPANY FOR END THE BRAND FROM SCRATCH SO WE ARE VERY PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED IN YOUR COUNTRY
ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ARE THE COLONY WE'VE HAD ANOTHER POSSIBILITY OF A BAIL OUT FOR THE ITALIAN BANKS ITEALAIN MANUFACTURING HAS BEEN DOING O.K. BUT DO YOU THINK IT HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE OR YOU A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED I CAME IN WHY YOU TELL ME THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS A LOT OF FANTASTIC THINGS AS NATURE OF ART CULTURE AND THE FOOD WOULD BE
IT'S A SECTION ABOUT COMPLETION ECONOMICALLY AND FINANCIALLY SPEAKING SO REALLY AT THAT ACCOUNT BECAME IN THE STAND WHERE WE ARE
DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR MANY MANY YEARS I THINK THE PROBLEM IS TO TRY TO MAKE THE COUNTRY MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR RARE FOR INVESTORS
THEN AT THE END I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MUCH MORE TRANSPARENCY ESPECIALLY IN ECONOMY IN THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE HAVE STILL A LOT OF BED KAY'S OR CORRUPTION HE BANKS THERE AN EXAMPLE OF
THE AREAS THEY CAN SAY SELL I AM I THINK OF THE COUNTRY OR STEAL A GRAPE THE PATIENT BECAME ABSOLUTELY AMAZING WE HAVE TO BELIEVE IN IT AND HAVE IT WE HAVE TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE PEOPLE THAT THIS IS NOT A THREAT THAT IS THE WAY WE HAVE TO FOLLOW IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THE COUNTRY HERE'S AN IDEA PERHAPS YOU COULD LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW DESIST FREE ITALY COULD BE A DISASTER

BUT NOTHING'S GOING ON BUT IT'S ALL GONNA BE FINE AND THEN LAID HER CROUCHING IN A RESTAURANT WITH A WHOLE LOAD OF YOUNG CHILDREN
KEEP THEM CALM AND OF COURSE THEY CAN'T THEY'RE CRYING AND
WATCHING THAT REALLY WAS I THINK THE MOST HEARTBREAKING THING A REPORTER JOHN DONALDSON IS ON THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS NICE WHERE THE ATTACK HAPPENED LAST NIGHT AND JOHN WHAT IS THE SCENE THERE NOW THIS MORNING
A LODGE POLICE CORDON HAS BEEN SET UP NOW WE'RE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED METRES DOWN FROM WHERE I CAN SEE THE TRUCK SITTING ON THE PROMENADE IS ON IT LOOKS TO HAVE ITS WINDSCREEN RIDDLED WITH BULLET HOLES
A LOT OF PEACE IT DOWN OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF MEDIA AND JUST LISTENING TO THAT GUY YOU HEARD FROM THERE I MEAN THE PROMENADE IS ONLY LAST NIGHT WHICH IS A HUGE BOULEVARDS STRETCHING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE EAST
WILL HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY PACKED LAST NIGHT BASTILLE DAY CELEBRATIONS HAD JUST FINISHED FINISH FAMILIES WERE DOWN
WATCHING THE FIREWORKS AND IT WILL HAVE BEEN CHOCK A BLOCK AND THIS TRUCK REARED UP ONTO THE PAVEMENT
AND WAS DRIVEN WE UNDERSTAND THA TWO KILOMETRES THROUGH THOSE CLOUDS SO CROWD SO WELL OVER A MILE
CAUSING ABSOLUTE CARNAGE AND IT'S CLEAR FROM WHAT WE WERE HEARING FROM SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW IT THAT INITIALLY THEY JUST THOUGHT IT WAS OUT OF CONTROL IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE THE TRUCK THAT THEY REALISED THAT THIS WAS A MORE LIKELY A TERRORIST
THAT'S RIGHT THERE ARE SOME REPORTS THAT THE DRIVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIRING GUNS OUT OF THE WINDOW CERTAINLY PLEASE SAY GUNS AND GRENADES WERE FOUND IN THE TRUCK ONCE HE HAD BEEN KILLED BUT INITIALLY
PEOPLE WON'T HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON THEN THEY'LL HAVE SEEN THIS TRIP UP ON THE PAVEMENT IT WAS APPARENTLY SWERVING ACCORDING TO SOME WITNESSES TO TRY AND HIT AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE I MEAN THIS WOULD BE LIKE DRIVING DOWN OXFORD STREET IN CENTRAL LONDON ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT BUSY
WHAT ARE THEY ABLE TO TELL US ABOUT THE MAN WHO WAS DRIVING THE TRUCK AND WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT IS WHETHER THE PIECE OF I.D. THAT THEY FOUND IN THE TRUCK ACTUALLY BELONG TO
THE DRIVER THAT IS NOT CLEAR BUT THE POLICE SAY THEY HAVE FOUND SOME I.D. IN THE TRUCK BELONGING TO A THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD MAN
FROM THE EAST OF JORDAN FRENCH TUNISIAN NATIONALITY NOW THE REUTERS NEWS AGENCY HAS JUST REPORTED THAT THAT MAN ON THAT I.D. CARD AT LEAST IS KNOWN
# TO POLICE BUT NOT TO THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES IN FRANCE AND OBVIOUSLY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE DETAILS LATER IN THE DAY TWENTY WILL OF COURSE BE BRINGING YOU ANYTHING WE HAVE AS WE GET IT THIS MORNING JOHN DONNA SOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH A TIME TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN OWEN SMITH IS GOING TO LAUNCH HIS CAMPAIGN TO BE LABOUR LEADER TODAY NICK SABINE IS WALES POLITICAL EDITOR AND IS ON THE LINE WHAT'S HE GONNA SAY
WHAT HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DEEP PERIL THAT THE LABOUR PARTY BELIEVES IN SOMETHING HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS NOW AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR A NEW GENERATION OF LABOUR LEADERS TO COME IN AFTER PLENTY OF SPECULATION HE FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS GOING TO PUT HIS HAT INTO THE RING A FEW DAYS AGO THEN HE TALKED ABOUT BEING HAVING US FOR A COMBINATION OF
RADICALISM AND CREDIBILITY THIS SENSE THAT HE CAN APPEAL TO THE LEFT OF THE PARTY WITH THAT ANTI AUSTERITY CREDENTIALS BUT ALSO HAVE AN ELECT ABILITY WHICH HE BELIEVES JEREMY CORBIN DOESN'T HAVE LATER THIS MORNING HE WILL
FORMERLY HAVE AN EVENT AT A LOCAL COLLEGE NEAR HIS HOME TOWN OF PONT TO BREATHE I SEE A BIT OF WHAT HE'S GOING TO SAY AND I THINK THERE'LL BE MUCH MORE OF A PERSONAL FEEL ABOUT IT HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIS POLITICAL AWAKENING IN THE MINERS' STRIKE IN SOUTH WALES HOW HE'S ROOTED IN THE SOCIALIST PRINCIPLES OF HIS HOME TOWN
AND IN DOING THAT I THINK YOU TRIED TO DEAL WITH ONE OF HIS BIG CHALLENGES WHICH IS PROFILE HE HAS A POLITICAL PROFILE IN WALES HE HAS A POLITICAL PROFILE AT WESTMINSTER BUT IT'S OUTSIDE AND AROUND THE REST OF THE U.K. THAT HE REALLY NEEDS TO BECOME BETTER KNOWN TELL PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE IS
AND MOST URGENTLY OF COURSE TO DO THAT TO THEIR LABOUR MEMBERSHIP WHO WILL VOTE IN THIS CONTEST YOU'RE IN THE COURSE OF THE SUMMER YOU'VE GOT AN INTERESTING IDEA ON EUROPE HASN'T HE HE SEEMS TO BE SUGGESTING THAT WE SHOULD ONCE WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT WITH EUROPE AND INDEED WHAT WE'RE LIKELY TO GET WITH YOU ARE ONCE THE OUTLINE OF A DEAL IS THERE THAT WE SHOWED WHAT GO GO GO BACK TO ANOTHER REFERENDUM YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
SORT OF TOUCHED ON BY A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE BUT HE WAS QUITE EXPLICIT ABOUT TO DO A NEWSPAPER INTERVIEW THIS WEEK THAT ONCE THE TERMS OF THE BREAK ZILLI KNOWN THEN THOSE SHOULD BE PUT BACK TO THE COUNTRY EITHER BY A REFERENDUM OR IN THE FORM OF A GENERAL ELECTION SO JUST VERY MUCH THIS SENSE THAT IT NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE COUNTRY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR SAY OBVIOUSLY HE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ACCUSATIONS THAT'S NOT DEALING WITH
THE DEMOCRATIC WISHES OF SO MANY IN FACT SO MANY LABOUR SUPPORTERS AND IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN AREAS LIKE THE SOUTH WALES VALLEYS WHERE THE LAUNCH WILL BE LATER THIS MORNING WHICH PREDOMINATELY VOTED TO LEAVE BUT IT WILL BE ONE OF THE POLICY AREAS THAT HE WILL BE LOOKING TO PUT OUT THERE AND CERTAINLY TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE HIMSELF I THINK FROM ANGELA EAGLE'S MAY CONTENDER AND OF COURSE JEREMY CORBIN WHO BOTH OF THEM WILL BE UP AGAINST NEXT THANK YOU

THE FORMER FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS MITTERRAND ONE SAID MARGARET THATCHER HAD THEIR EYES OFF CALLY KILLER
# ONE LABOUR M.P. HE'S SCARED BRITAIN'S NEWEST PRIME MINISTER THERESA MARY HAS THE JUDGEMENT OF KILLER KILLER THE APPOINTMENT OF THE NEW FOREIGN SECRETARY MUST BE THE MOST REMARKABLE SINCE THE EMPEROR CALIGULA APPOINTEES HORSE AS A SENATOR
LABOUR'S KEVIN BRENNAN ON THE CHOICE OF BORIS JOHNSON AS FOREIGN SECRETARY IN THERESA MAY'S DRAMATIC AND RADICAL GOVERNMENT RESHUFFLE AND AS EVER WITH MY JOHNSON HIS WAS THE APPOINTMENT WHICH GOT EM PEAS MUST STIRRED UP THE S.N.P. SPOKESMAN PETE WISH IT FELT IT REFLECTED WELL ON THERESA MAY IN ONE RESPECT WE THOUGHT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER THE NEW PRIME MINISTER DIDN'T HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR
WE'RE GOING TO PRUNE THAT WENT TOTALLY WRONG BY A POINT ON THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXBRIDGE IS A FORMER SECRETARY
YOU COULD ALMOST HAVE HERE OF THE GUFF WAS OF RASTA FROM PARLIAMENT'S AMBASSADOR
LAST NIGHT AS A NEWS GOT AROUND THAT BORIS WAS IN CHARGE OF THE U.K.'S FOREIGN POLICY AND INDEED IN M.I.SIX SIX IS ALSO IN CHARGE OF TWO
CHRIS GRAYLING NOW TRANSPORT SECRETARY BUT THEN LEADER OF THE HOUSE AVOIDED ANY COMMENT ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON SO OTHER M.P.S PRESSED HIM AGAIN THIS WAS THE LIB DEM TOM BREAK WHO SEEM TO WANT TO KNOW HOW U.K. MANUFACTURERS WILL FEEL DEMAND FOR MAJOR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE
EH TRANSCONTINENTAL NETWORK OF ZIP WIRES TO ENABLE A NEW FOREIGN SECRETARY TO TRAVEL CHEAPLY AND WITH LOW ENVIRONMENTALLY LOW ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND IN THE STYLE HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO AROUND THE WORLD
OF COURSE TOM BREAK HAD BEEN RECALLING THOSE PICTURES OF A BURLY AND BE SUITED MY JOHNSON BECALMED ON A ZIP WIRE WITH THIS TWO LITTLE FLAGS AGAIN CHRIS GRAYLING PLAYED A VERY STRAIGHT BAT INDEED WELL IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA MISTER SPEAKER BUT I THINK WILL PROBABLY BE INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S MORE USED TO CARS TRAINS AND BUSES
LABOUR'S SPOKESMAN PAUL FLYNN FELT DAVID CAMERON'S DOWNFALL HAD BEEN A POLITICAL SUICIDE NOW THERESA MAY WAS DOING THE SAME WE SEE IN THE GOVERNMENT BEING CREATED NOT FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY
BUT IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE PERPETUAL INTERNAL WAR IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO IN EURO
GIVEN LABOUR'S OWN TROUBLES CHRIS GRILLING WAS SURPRISE PAUL FLYNN WRIST ASKING THAT I'M GOING TO SPEAK AT THIS WEEK OF ALL WEEKS FOR A LABOUR POLITICIAN YOU TALK ABOUT INTERNAL WAR POLITICAL PARTY
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN TO GET RID OF THAT LEADER THEY JUST CAN'T DO IT HE'S ON THE BALLOT PAPER WILL PROBABLY WIN AGAIN AND THEY'LL BE RESIGN ALL YEAR IT IS A COMPLETE SHAMBLES THEY ARE COMPLETE DISGRACE THIS COUNTRY POLITICALLY I WILL TAKE NO LESSONS FROM THEM THE WARS WITHIN POLITICAL PARTIES

WE CONGRATULATE THREW HIM THE PRIME MINISTER ON HER CHOICES ON THE QUALITY OF HER SACKINGS AND DISMISSALS FOR GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT ON A CROSS PARTY BASIS THE SECRETARIES OF STATE THE MEMBERS FAILED MY MEMBERS WERE HOPING PRICE AND HAUPTMANN OR SOMERSET SERIOUS POLITICIANS
BUT THEIR WAR SEEMS TO BE THE COURT JESTER OF THE NEW FOREIGN SECRETARY SURE CHARLES THESE SERIOUS POLITICIANS HAVE THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTS OF STATE OR WILL THEY BE ANSWERING TO THE NEW FOREST
CHRIS GRAYLING WISELY DECLINED TO PUT THE MINISTERS IN ANY ORDER WELL WHEN THE DAY STARTED EVERYTHING WAS STILL IN A STATE OF FLUX THAT ENERGY SECRETARY AMBER RUDD WAS NOW THE HOME SECRETARY SO WHILE EXCITING THINGS WERE GOING ON ELSEWHERE WHO WAS GOING TO ANSWER COMMONS ENERGY QUESTIONS FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
IT WAS YES ANDREA LEAD SOME FOUR DAYS PREVIOUSLY SHE WAS STILL IN THE RUNNING TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER HERSELF NOW I WENT BEFORE HER NEW CABINET JOB WAS ANNOUNCED SHE WAS THE ONLY ENERGY MINISTER LEFT IN THE COMMONS BUT SHE WAS STOIC ABOUT IT
I'M QUITE USED TO BEING THE LAST PERSON ON THE BATTLEFIELD SO I KNOW MY PLACE UP AND DOWN SHE JUMPED FOR THE NEXT HOUR ANSWERING ALL THE QUESTIONS ON HER OWN AND AFTER ALL THESE TURBULENT WEEK'S HISTORY IN THE MAKING PARIS STRUGGLES AND UNCERTAINTY THERE ONE TIME PRIME MINISTERIAL CANDIDATES SPOKE IN THE END FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME MORE THAN A NICE HOLIDAY

OH CHRISTOPER MAP IS FRENCH SOCIALIST M. P. HE WAS IN NICE LAST NIGHT HE JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU YOU MUST BE DESPERATELY SHOCKED
IT'S GOOD MORNING YES OF COURSE I THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE NIGHT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE CELEBRATION OF THE YEAR OF THE BEST T. V. FORTY MUCH ALIGNED ON I THINK THAT'S
THAT'S WHAT THREW RUGS I WOULD MAKE YOU TORE MY FAMILY OTHER WANTED TO TAKE PART IN THIS VERY DID YOU FANCY IN THE EASTER AROUND THE POINT OF THIS PLACE I'VE GOT THAT THAT'S A TERRIBLE EVENING WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
WHERE ARE THEY PRETTY BANDS ARE ANNOUNCED THE EXTENSION OF YOUR MAJESTY THAT YOU WERE
MORE LESS ADMITTED USED TO TO THE SECURITY FORCES BUT WHAT WILL WE DO ABOUT THREE REALLY I THINK THAT'S IT'S NOT IN TERMS OF SECURITY OFF ANTI TERRORIST NATIONS BUT WE NEED TO GO FURTHER I THINK IF CHAMPS OFF SHARING INFORMATION OFF OF SHARING MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE CAME A FEW ROUND SOME MAYBE RETREAT I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN TACKLE BLUE SKY AND A FEW BANDS BECAUSE
WE DO YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THE TRUCK JUST CAME INSIDE THE CITY WITH THE YEAR ON THE PRODUCT IS GREAT I THINK THAT THAT'S A VERY STRANGE FEELING AS YOU HAD DEAR THE FIREWORKS AND THEN WHEN YOU HEAR SOME GUNSHOTS YOU DON'T REALISE THAT DO YOU THINK THAT NEXT IT'S AN EXTENSION OF THE OTHER FIREWORKS BUT THAT'S NUTS
THAT'S THAT'S WE OR YOU WE'VE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING VERY EURGH COMPETITION SAY I DO I THINK WE WILL YES WE NEED TO WERE TO BE AWARE OF THAT BUT IS THERE ENOUGH BEING DONE COULD EARN MORE IS THERE MORE TO BE DONE WHEN IT COMES TO REACHING OUT TO COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO HAVE THE KIND OF INTELLIGENCE THE KIND OF SENSE OF WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT IS BEING FELT BY INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
I THINK THAT'S THE HARDEST BORN TO SO YOU WANT WITH THE MAXI SIX SECURITY SHE JUST WORRIED YOU COULD YOU'LL TRAIN SHE WERE TOO PRECARIOUS HE'S TERRIBLE ACT THAT'S THE WAY YOU CAN PROVE THERE WAS THAT'S FROM SOMETHING FROM HAPPENING THAT'S OUR MOST IMPORTED WHAT SO YOU NEED TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION
BEFORE IT HAPPENED SO YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HER AND SO ON THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S HORRIBLE YOU SEE THAT ONE IN DO YOU READ YOUR CHAMP
SO MANY PEOPLE OR JUST WITH THE SCANNER OFF FROM LAST BUY IT THAT'S THE WORST THING IS THERE WAS A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL ACTION
WE KNEW WE HAD A TOOTH I DON'T DO IT AT THE FORMATIONS CHARITIES THAT WE ALERTED US THAT'S A LITTLE BIT BUT IT COULD USE A NEW TECHNICS BOMB SEEN CARD SOMETHING ABOUT ROBERTS YOU WERE SPRAYED WITH A FEELING OF FEAR
THAT'S THAT'S VERY HEARTS YOU SHE WERE TO ALL THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY THAT THAT FEELING OF FEAR IS GOING TO PLAY INTO THE HANDS OF THE FAR RIGHT IN FRANCE DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT
I THINK WE NEED TO BE STRONG AND YOU NEED TO TO CHOOSE TEN UP TOGETHER AND SO WE KNOW THAT SOME KIND OF TO YOUR ATTACKS WE HAPPEN A TRUNCHEON AT HAD THAT THE PRIME MINISTER SAY THAT YOU'VE BEEN SEEING THE SAME THING DURING THE LAST MARCH
THE AUTHORITIES HERE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME TOUR ATTACKS IN THE FUTURE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO STAMMER AND FIGHT FOR OWL VERY USE
WE NEED TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE OUR ER FREEDOM MORALLY LIBERTY THAT'S WHY I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ANTI LODGED ANTI TERRORIST STATION A WEEK WE HAVE THE LAWS WE HAVE EVERYTHING NOW BUT
WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP THE SENSE OF FREEDOM AND THAT'S IT YOU RUN IF THE PRICEY THREE HEIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE CHERRIES ONE OF US DID YOU
# CRYSTAL CREMA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THIS MORNING IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN A WOMAN WHO HAD OVARIAN TISSUE REMOVED AND FROZEN BEFORE HAVING CHEMOTHERAPY HAS GONE ON TO HAVE A HEALTHY BABY BOY FROM THE EXIT PRODUCED IS THE FIRST TIME THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE U.K. AND ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN THE WORLD
WELL THE MAN WHO OVERSAW THE TREATMENT AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY IN THE CENTRE FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS PROFESSOR RICHARD ANDERSON WHO'S WITH US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THIS WOMAN WHO I THINK IT HAPPENED ELEVEN YEARS AGO THAT THE PERCEPTION OF HER OVARY WAS MOVED SHE HAD VERY LITTLE HOPE THAT IT WOULD WORK AT THAT TIME DID YOU THAT'S RIGHT AS YOU SAY THIS WAS A QUITE A LONG TIME AGO AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE VERY UNCERTAIN AND LIKE WE STILL ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW EFFECTIVE THIS IS AND HOW MANY WOMEN THIS REALLY WILL WORK FOR
BUT IT'S A FANTASTIC DEMONSTRATION THAT IT CAN WORK BECAUSE WHAT SHE HAD THE FROZEN OVARIAN TISSUE RE IMPLANTED AND WENT ON TO CONCEIVE NATURALLY THAT'S RIGHT SO WE CARRIED OUT SOME KEYHOLE SURGERY ELEVEN YEARS AGO TO TAKE PIECES OF OVARY AND THEN WHEN SHE CAME BACK TO SEE US LAST YEAR SAYING SHE WANTED TO START A FAMILY WE CARRIED OUT A FURTHER KEYHOLE SURGERY
PUT THE PIECES OF OVARY BACK ON WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY PRETTY CLOSE TO WHERE WE TAKEN THEM ON ALL THOSE YEARS AGO AND WONDERFULLY IT STARTED WORKING AND SHE WAS ABLE TO FALL PREGNANT AND HAVE THIS OFF OBVIOUSLY OFFERS HUGE HOPE FOR ANYONE WHO IS HAVING CANCER TREATMENT AT A YOUNG AGE
THAT'S RIGHT SO I THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT THAT BACKGROUND HERE IS THE WONDERFUL ADVANCES IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCERS OF OF CHILDREN YOUNG WOMEN THAT HAVE REALLY RADICALLY CHANGED THE CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OF THESE CONDITIONS THAT USED TO BE SUCH TERRIBLE NEWS AND NOW THE GREAT MAJORITY WILL GO ON AND SURVIVE
SO INCREASINGLY WERE FOCUSING ON IMPROVING THEIR LONG TERM OUTCOMES FOR THESE PATIENTS AND ONE OF THE RISKS THAT THEY WORRY AND PARTICULARLY AS A FOCUS FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AS THE RISK TO LOSS OF THEIR FERTILITY SO YES THIS IS A GREAT STEP FORWARD I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT SHE HAD SORT OF CONSIDERED IT WAS SOMEBODY POSSIBLY YOUTH WHO HAD PROPOSED TO HER YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT DOING THIS WELL IT WAS HER ONCOLOGIST SEARCHING GLASGOW WHO REFER TO THROUGH TO US IN EDINBURGH THEY WERE AWARE THAT WE WERE DEVELOPING THIS THIS SERVICE FOR OUR GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN
SO YES IT WAS FANTASTIC THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF IT AND WERE ABLE TO SEND HER THROUGH AND WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE THIS FORWARD FOR HER BECAUSE SHE ATE SHE WAS AN ADULT WHEN THIS PROCEDURE WAS CARRIED OUT ON HER ARE YOU DOING IT TO MANY MUCH YOUNGER GIRLS YES SHE WAS TWENTY TWO SO SHE WAS ADDER REALLY PROBABLY A FAIRLY IDEAL YOUNG ADULT AGE FOR THIS BUT YES WE HAVE ALSO BEEN CARRIED THIS OUT ON CHILDREN OF VERY YOUNG AGE I THINK THE YOUNGEST IS ONLY ABOUT FOUR MONTHS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS FOR
SO THERE ISN'T REALLY A LOWER LIMIT OF AGE FOR THIS BECAUSE THE THE ISSUE FOR WOMEN IS THAT THEY FORM ALL THE EGGS IN THEIR OVARIES BEFORE THEY'RE BORN SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU HAVE THE MOST AND THEN THEY'RE PROGRESSIVELY LOST OVERTIME SO REALLY THE YOUNGER THE BETTER
SO THE TISSUE THAT YOU'VE REMOVED FROM THEIR FOUR MONTH OLD YOU WILL HOPE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE TO RE IMPLANT IN THE PATIENT WHEN THEY'RE AN ADULT AND THAT AND GO ONTO ABSOLUTELY NOW COURSE THAT MAY NOT BE MYSELF UP BY THE TIME THEY AGAINST BUT IT SHOWS QUITE WHAT A LONG TIME SCALE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THIS SORT OF TREATMENTS
THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO'S HAD THIS BABY IN THIS WAS ELEVEN YEARS AGO THAT WE DID THIS AND CHILDREN THAT WERE STORING ON WHO MIGHT BE ONLY A FEW YEARS OLD YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE TWENTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE THEY COME BACK TO SEE US WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN OF COURSE CAN THE SAME BE DONE FOR MEN THAT'S EVEN PERHAPS EVEN MORE EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENTAL SO OBVIOUSLY SPERM STORAGE FOR ADULT MEN HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME
BUT BE ABLE TO STORE PIECES OF TESTIS TISSUE FROM PRE PRE BATTLE BOYS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT CURRENTLY ISN'T DEVELOPMENTS AND WE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED SERVICE FOR THAT HERE IN EDINBURGH AND CARRIED OUT THAT PROCEDURE ON ON A SMALL NUMBER OF YOUNG BOYS WHO ALSO CAMBIO OF ANY YOUNG AGE
THE QUESTION WITH THEM IS THAT AT THE MOMENT IS MORE AN EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE WERE REALLY A LITTLE UNSURE AS TO HOW WE CAN DEAL WITH THE TISSUE AND HOW BEST TO PUT IT BACK BUT OF COURSE IF WE DON'T STORE IT NOW WE WON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY IN TEN FIFTEEN YEARS WHEN THEY WANT TO COME BACK PROFESSOR RICHARD ANDERSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# TIME THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND PHILIP AVERY SAY LITTLE JUSTIN THANKS VERY GOOD MORNING TO SEE IT'S A BRIGHT ENOUGH START ACROSS THE EASTERN SIDE OF ENGLAND'S BUT IF WE LOOK AT ENGLAND AND WALES AS A WHOLE OUT TOWARDS THE WEST WE ALREADY HAVE THE FIRST SIGNS OF A WARM FRANCE AN AREA OF CLOUD ALREADY PRODUCING RAIN ACROSS WESTERN WALES AND THIS WILL WORK ITS WAY ACROSS ALL OF ENGLAND AND WALES DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY AROUND ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY I THINK MUCH OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THE NORTH MIDLANDS WILL SEE SOME REALLY QUITE HEAVY RAIN AT TIMES FOR A TIME
THAT THEIR MOVES AWAY AND WE'RE LEFT WITH THIS GREAT RAFT OF CLOUD AND OTHER SOUTHERN COUNTIES FOR THE MOST PART WILL SPEND MUCH OF THE DAY DRY AND THERE'S A CHANCE OF SOME SUNSHINE COMING THROUGH DESPITE ALL THE CLOUD THAT COULD POP THE TEMPERATURES UP TO TWENTY ONE ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF WALES AND EVENTUALLY PERHAPS ONCE THE HEAVIEST RAINS GONE ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PENNINES SOME NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE AT SOME POINT BUT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CLOUD AND THERE IS THAT CHANCE OF RAIN AS A SAY ROUND ABOUT THE MIDDLE PART OF THE DAY FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IT REALLY IS QUITE WET AT THE MOMENT
THEN THE RAIN WILL CLEAR AROUND ABOUT LUNCHTIME FOR A TIME BEFORE COMING BACK INTO NORTHERN AND WESTERN PARTS PARTICULARLY BUT AGAIN IF THE CLOUD BREAKS AND IT IS A BIT OF AN EFFORT YOU COULD SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE NINETEEN WHICH WILL BE GENERALLY AVAILABLE TWENTY ONE COULD WELL BE YOURS AND FOR SCOTLAND THE RAIN EVENTUALLY GETTING INTO THE SOUTH WESTERN QUARTER EARLY THIS MORNING AND THEN WORKING ITS WAY UP TO THE NORTH EAST OF THE MAINLAND BY A ROUND ABOUT SORT OF MID AFTERNOON TO SHETLAND BY THIS EVENING AND A HIGH OF NINETY

RUN AWAY NICK SEE MICK BEING WHERE THE TRUCK WHAT'S THAT
EACH NOW THERE WAS A SEPARATE BODY BEHIND THE TRUCK WHICH LIKE I KIND OF ASSUMED THAT WAS PROBABLY THE PERPETRATOR SIR THERE WAS A LOT OF POLICE AROUND NOT BODY UNDERNEATH NO CHANNEL AND WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE CHILDREN AMONG THE DEAD AND OBVIOUSLY CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN CELEBRATING AND WATCHING SUN IT'S ABSOLUTELY
WILL HAVE BEEN LOTS OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES LOTS OF VERY YOUNG PEOPLE I'M SURE SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE IN THE HOTEL AFTER IT HAPPENED I WAS UP IN THE ROOM I DIDN'T GO THAT DOWN WITH DON'T YOU WE WENT OUT OF THEIR ROOM IT WOULD BE WERE RUMOURS OF EQUAL BEING IN THE HOTEL NEXT THE WOODS LOOK THAN THE ONE ON THE OTHER
AND IN TERMS OF ANY WERE YOU GIVEN ANY ADVICE WHAT WHAT WAS THE SORT OF THE FEELING IN THE ADVICE USE NOTHING BUT I DIDN'T I DIDN'T MEAN ANY FUN

I NOW KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN MANY BUT HE'S A BIT DOWN THE PROMENADE TO THE GROUP HERE THERE WERE JUST REALLY CLOSE TOGETHER AND THEY HADN'T OTIS'S ONE SEPARATE BOB YOU'VE GOT TREES DIMENSIONS IT WAS JUST A VERY STRANGE PEOPLE
KEVIN HARRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US OUR CORRESPONDENT JOHN DONNA IS DOWN ON THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS ON ON THE ROAD WHERE THIS TRUCK HAD DRIVEN THAT THE TWO KILOMETRES AND JOHN WE WERE HEARING THAT THE SCENE AS KEVIN SAYS FROM HIS HIS BALCONY WHAT ARE YOU AWARE OF NOW AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON
POLICE HAVE SET UP A CORDON IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED METRES FROM WHERE THE TRUCK IS NOW RESTING
ONTO THE WINDSCREEN IS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS AND PRESUMABLY FORENSICS ARE IN CARRYING OUT
LOOKING INTO WHAT THEY CAN FIND
LAST NIGHT YOU COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF AMBULANCES INTO THE NIGHT AS BODIES WILL HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND OBVIOUSLY THE INJURED BEEN TAKEN TO HOSPITAL THIS MORNING OBVIOUSLY THE PROMENADE IS COMPLETELY
SHUT DOWN BUT IT'S WE WERE HEARING THERE FROM THAT EYEWITNESS
IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY PACKED WITH PEOPLE AND THE REMARKABLE THING
THE MOST STRIKING THING FOR ME AT LEAST I MEAN THIS TRUCK ABLE TO DRIVE THROUGH THE CROWD
FOR MORE THAN A MILE TWO KILOMETRES THE POLICE DRIVING AT SPEED
THROUGH A STREET PACKED WITH PEOPLE AND MANY MANY CHILDREN WILL HAVE BEEN OUT LAST NIGHT FOR THESE FIREWORKS AND DO THEY KNOW THAT THERE WAS JUST ONE THAT IT WAS A LONE ATTACK
WELL INITIALLY THERE WERE REPORTS THAT PIECE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN ACCOMPLICE BUT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE COME TO NOTHING AT CERTAINLY POLICE WILL BE LOOKING INTO
WHETHER THIS MAN WAS OPERATING ALONE OR WHETHER HE WAS PART OF SOME SORT ADVERT BUT CERTAINLY AT THIS STAGE WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO NOW
IS THAT HE WAS APPARENTLY A THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD MAN A LOCAL MAN FROM
OF FRENCH TUNISIAN JAWOHL NATIONALITY AND THAT HE WAS KNOWN TO POLICE
BUT NOT TO THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES THE
THERE HAD BEEN A STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT WAS JUST ABOUT TO BE LIFTED IT HAS NOW EFFECTIVELY BEEN RE IMPOSED EXTENDED THIS IS THE REACTION THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE POLITICIANS IN FRANCE AND THE AUTHORITIES WHAT WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW
WELL IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY REALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT FRANZ WAS ALREADY IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT WAS DUE TO EXPIRE OR THINKING ABOUT TWO WEEKS' TIME AFTER THOSE ATTACKS IN PARIS
IN NOVEMBER THAT KILLED SOME HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE
FRANCOIS LON APPEARED ON TELEVISION LATE LAST NIGHT TO SAY THAT HE WAS EXTENDING
THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY BUT I THINK WHAT IS SO SHOCKING ABOUT THIS ATTACK IS ITS ITS BRUTALITY AND ITS SIMPLICITY WHAT CAN YOU DO TO STOP SOMEONE
DRIVING A VEHICLE INTO PEOPLE I MEAN IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING
EUROPE AND CERTAINLY ON THE SCALE I KNOW THAT IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN PLACES LIKE ISRAEL THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT
BY PALESTINIANS AGAINST ISRAELIS WHETHER DROVE CARS INTO PEOPLE
IT'S VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP UNLESS YOU CAN FIND OUT WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MOTIVATED TO DO THIS KIND OF THING AND IT JUST SEEMED LIKE THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WON'T WEREN'T AWARE OF THIS MAN JOHN JONATHAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# BUT I'M NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERESA MAY IS WASTING NO TIME GETTING TO GRIPS WITH ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT SHE FACES THAT IS OF COURSE WHAT TO DO ABOUT SCOTLAND WHERE MOST PEOPLE VOTED TO STAY IN THE ROOM WHERE THE FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON IS CONSIDERING HER OPTIONS INCLUDING SHE SAYS PRESSING FOR A NEW INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM WE CAN TALK TO THE SCOTTISH SECRETARY DAVID MANDELAS IN OUR RADIO CAR GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING AND THE TWO OF THEM MEET TODAY WHEN THEY MEET DOES MISSUS MAY HAVE A PLAN
TO OFFER SOMETHING TO NICOLA STURGEON IN THE WAY OF FLEXIBILITY ON THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE
FIRSTLY WHAT MISSUS MAY'S MAKE CLEAR AND SHE MADE IT CLEAR ON THE DOWNING STREET TO EDGE A DOORSTEP IS THAT SHE'S ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO OUR UNITED KINGDOM KEEPING SCOTLAND AS PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THAT SHE'S VISITING SCOTLAND TODAY AS ONE OF HER AS HER FIRST OFFICIAL VISIT US AS PRIME MINISTER
OBVIOUSLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAD MADE CLEAR AND I'M SURE MISSUS MABEL MAKE CLEAR THAT THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE VERY MUCH AT THE HEART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH I'M GOING TO TAKE PLACE THAT IS SHE WILLING TO GO ANY FURTHER I WONDER THAN THE LAST GOVERNMENT THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT HAS SHE GOT ANYTHING UP HER SLEEVE TODAY THAT SHE CAN SAY TO NICOLA STURGEON LOOK THIS IS THIS IS POTENTIALLY THE INVOLVEMENT YOU COULD
I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT WE WANT THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT TO BE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS AND MISSES ME WHAT SHE HAS DONE IS ALREADY SET OUT A STRUCTURE
FOR THOSE NEGOTIATIONS TO TAKE PLACE WE'VE GOT A MINISTER CABINET MINISTER AND DAVID DAVIS NOW WHO'S GOING TO HAVE THE OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE NEGOTIATIONS BEHIND THAT A DEPARTMENT IS FORMING WHICH WILL HAVE THE
THE PROCESS ELEMENTS OF THAT AND THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT WILL BE VERY VERY MUCH INVOLVED AT THAT THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSIONS
BETWEEN SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS AS TO HOW THAT WERE ALL WORK OF COURSE COMPROMISE OWN PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO VERY MUCH SEE THAT THE U.K. GETS THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL NOT JUST FOR THE
FOR THE U.K. AS A WHOLE BUT FIRST SCOTLAND WE'RE ALREADY ENGAGING VERY CLOSELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN SCOTLAND SCOTTISH BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE AS TO EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE BUT WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN VERY VERY CLEAR ON IS THAT THEY WANT TO SEE A TEAM NEW KEY APPROACH THAT SCOTT THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT IN U.K. GOVERNMENT WORKING TOGETHER AND WHAT
PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND DON'T WANT IS THIS TOXIC AND DIVISIVE ISSUE OF A SECOND SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM BEING PUT ON THE TABLE AND ISSUES AROUND THE E.D. UNIT WHAT THEY DO WANT THOSE TO STAY IN THE U. AND THAT HAS SOME MORAL FORCE DOESN'T IT
THEIR VOTE IN SCOTLAND WAS LIKE THE VOTE ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE U.K. IT WAS A VOTE FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM TO REMAIN IN THE E.U.
WHAT THE FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLAND AND HER PARTY THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY WON HIS FIRST SCOTLAND TO LEAVE THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT'S A RAISON PETRA THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH THEY DON'T HIDE THAT BUT THERE WASN'T A VOTE ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE THAT IF IF THE U.K. DIDN'T REMAIN IN THE E.U. THAT SCOTLAND WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE U.K. A LOT OF LITTLE BITS
I DON'T SEE IT IT'S NOT OBVIOUS I DON'T SEE ANY MOOD IN SCOTLAND TO HAVE HIS SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM WHAT I SEE IS A MOOD
TO GET SCOTLAND AND THE REST OF THE U.K. THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL FROM THE E.U. NEGOTIATIONS I THINK YOU'RE ANXIOUS IS MABEL SAY TO THE FIRST MINISTER THAT THAT IS WHAT SHE IS DETERMINED TO DO DO YOU THINK WHEN THERE IS TALK OF INDEPENDENCE AND NICOLA STURGEON HAS MENTIONED IT SALMON AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT MUCH FURTHER AND SUGGESTED IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO HAPPEN NOW DO YOU THINK THEY'RE BLUFFING
I THINK THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO INDEPENDENCE FOR SCOTLAND BUT FOR THE REFERENDUM AT THAT AT THAT IS THAT IS THAT IS THEIR RAISON PETRA I THINK THE FIRST MINISTER HAS BEEN QUITE OPEN SHE WON'T HAVE A REFERENDUM UNLESS SHE THINKS SHE CAN WIN IT SHE MAY THINK AT THE MOMENT THAT SHE HAS CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SHE HAS A BETTER CHANCE
BUT WHAT THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND ARE VERY VERY CLEAR AND THIS IS CLEAR IN IN PAULING THAT'S BEEN TAKEN PLACE EVEN THOUGH HE MET IN A VERY SORT OF TUMULTUOUS PERIOD WHERE I THINK YOU COULDN'T FULLY RELIANT PULLING PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND ARE IN NO MOOD FOR A SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM AND BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR IN SCOTLAND
ISN'T IN THE MOOD TO HAVE ISSUE OF SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE BLURRING THE VERY VERY IMPORTANT NEGOTIATIONS TO GET SCOTLAND THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL FROM THE E. U. NEGOTIATION AND JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT IT IF THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THAT DEAL WHEN IT EMERGES AND IF THERE WAS A MOVE FOR ANOTHER REFERENDUM IT WOULD NOT BE STOPPED BY WESTMINSTER WOULD IT REALISTICALLY ALTHOUGH PERHAPS LEGALLY THAT COULD HAPPEN IT IT WOULDN'T
THERE ARE TWO ISSUES ONE IS A PROCESS ISSUE COULD THERE BE ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM AND OF COURSE THERE COULD BE ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM BUT
THE BIG ISSUE IS SHOULD THERE BE ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM GIVEN THAT OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE VOTED EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO TO REMAIN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM I'M CLEAR THE SHOULDN'T AND WILL CONTINUE TO PASSIONATELY MAKE THE CASE FOR THAT AND ALSO FOR THE BENEFIT SCOTLAND GETS FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM DAVID THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# IT'S NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND GOOGLE'S BEEN HIT BY NEW ANTI TRUST CHARGES BY THE EUROPEAN UNION KATIE PRESCOTT DOES IT WITH MORE KATIE THANKS SARAH THIS IS THE LATEST IN A LONG RUNNING AND EXTREMELY COMPLEX A GO BETWEEN EUROPEAN COMPETITION COMMISSION AND GOOGLE THIS TIME THE COMMISSION IS TAKING UMBRAGE OVER GOOGLE SEARCH ON THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND ALLEGING THAT GOOGLE HAS ABUSED IT'S HUGE MARKET SHARE TO PROMOTE ITS OWN SHOPPING SERVICES Y. YOU COMPETITION COMMISSIONER MARGARET HAVE A STAYER SAYS THAT GOOGLE HAS NO RIGHT TO LIMIT ITS RIVALS
BUT GOOGLE SAYS IT SERVICES ACTUALLY PROMOTE COMPETITION SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DAN TENSIONS A PARTNER ON THE LITIGATION TEAM AT THE LAW FIRM GOOD MORNING DAN GOOD MORNING KATIE WHAT ARE THESE LATEST COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS FOCUSING ON WHAT MIGHT SOMEONE THINK A RATHER OBSCURE ASPECTS OF GOOGLE'S VARIOUS SERVICES IN THE LATEST ONE IS
HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES IN YOUR FINE TWO PEOPLE WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS A GOOGLE SEARCH BOX ON THOSE SITES AND YOU CAN PUT YOUR SEARCH TURN INTO THERE AND YOU GET AXES TO GOOGLE'S USUAL SEARCH RETURNS AND IT'S THAT SERVICE THE ABILITY TO TO TO GET SEARCH RETURNS ON THIRD PARTY WEBSITES THAT THE COMMISSION FOCUSING ON THAT THAT'S ON TOP OF TWO OTHER THINGS THEY CONCERNED WITH
THE PROMINENCE THAT GOOGLE GIVE TO THEIR OWN PRICE COMPARISON SHOPPING COMPARISON SERVICE ON THEIR OWN SEARCH RETURNS AND ALSO THE ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM THE WAY THAT THEY'VE TRIED TO MAKE THAT THE DOMINANT OPERATING SYSTEM FOR MOBILE PHONES AS WE SAID THIS IS A LONG RUNNING SAGA AND THESE ARE ONLY THE LATEST ALLEGATIONS BEING MADE WHAT'S THE HISTORY TAUGHT US
THE COMMISSION HE RUNNING TO THEIR RESTAURANTS WITH THE THESE VARIOUS COMPETITION ISSUES WHICH THEY'RE FACING BUT IT ALSO THEY FACE PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF THE LAW OF DATA TAKE PROTECTION AND THERE WAS A VERY WELL KNOWN CASE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO FROM THE EUROPEAN COURT CALLED GOOGLE SPAIN WHICH ESTABLISHED THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN AND THAT MEANT A GREAT DEAL OF WORK IN ADMINISTRATION FOR GOOGLE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR NAMES REMOVED FROM GOOGLE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
IS THERE A SENSE THAT WITHOUT BRITAIN AS PART OF THE E.U. THAT THE EUROPEAN CONFIDENT COMPETITION COMMISSION WILL HAVE LESS CLOUT WHEN IT'S A SEWING BITS AND SIS LIKE PICK UP I DON'T THINK SO I MEAN THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF EUROPEAN UNION THAT REMAINS IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE MARKET IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED WITHOUT THE U.K. HOWEVER I THINK IT DOES SHOW THE EFFICACY OF THE ONLY THE E.U. IS IS REALLY
A SUBSTANTIAL SIZE TO TAKE ON A GLOBAL GIANT LIKE GOOGLE ONE COULDN'T IMAGINE THE U.K. COMPETITION AUTHORITIES REALLY BEING ABLE TO ENGAGE IN ANY SERIOUS WAY FINALLY THEN WHAT COULD THE FULL OUT OF ALL THIS BE WELL AT THESE PROCESSES ARE LONG AND SLOW AND MAY TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO GET SOME KIND OF CONCLUSION BUT WHO WILL BE CONCERNED ABOUT TWO THINGS THE FIRST ONE IS AN ADVERSE REGULATORY FINDING WHICH COULD BE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL FINE UP TO TEN PERCENT OF GLOBAL TURNOVER SIR COULD BE ENORMOUS
BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT THEN YOU COULD OPEN THE WAY TO CIVIL CLAIMS AND THEN THE OTHER THIRD PARTIES WHO SAY THEY'VE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THIS MAY SEEK TO RECOVER DAMAGES FROM GOOGLE JUST YESTERDAY SO IT WAS RECOVERED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION POUNDS FROM MASTERCARD IN I'M JUST SUCH A CLAIM WILL GOOGLE GIVES ITS RESPONSE TO THIS IN EIGHT WEEKS I'M SURE I'M SURE IT WILL RUN AND RUN THAT'S DONE TENSION ELSEWHERE

# THE FORMER SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY OWEN SMITH WILL FORMALLY LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN TO BE THE LABOUR LEADER HE WILL SAY THAT HE CAN STEER THE PARTY AWAY FROM A DISASTROUS SPLIT AND RETURN IT TO GOVERNMENT HE ENTERED THE RACE AFTER HIS FORMER SHADOW CABINET COLLEAGUE ANGELA EAGLE ANNOUNCED HER CHALLENGE TO JEREMY CORBIN
# PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MUST ADDRESSED HONESTLY THE ISSUES OF RACIAL BIAS AND THE WAY AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE TREATED BY THE POLICE IN A PUBLIC MEETING AIRED ON TELEVISION MY OBAMA CONCEDED THAT SOCIETY OFTEN REGARDED BLACK MEN AS DANGEROUS AND SPOKE OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCES OF BEING SHAN'T HE CALLED ON COMMUNITIES AND THE POLICE TO WORK TOGETHER
# THE UNITED NATIONS HAS FOR THE FIRST TIME DESCRIBED FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AS CHILD ABUSE AND SAID THE PRACTICE MUST END IMMEDIATELY MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION WOMEN AND GIRLS HAVE BEEN CUT FOR CULTURAL RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL REASONS MAINLY IN AFRICA THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA THE UN HAD PREVIOUSLY TURNED IT A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION THE TIME IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT AS YOU WOULD EXPECT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS LAUNDERS BEEN TALKING OVERNIGHT ABOUT SECURITY LET'S HEAR SOME OF WHAT HE'S BEEN SAYING
# AND THIS SYDNEY NICE IS NOW THAT HITS YOU IT'S ALL OF FRANCE IT WHICH IS UNDER THE THREAT OF ISLAMIC TERRORISM
NUMEROUS MEASURES HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN WE WE'VE REINFORCED A LEGISLATIVE POWERS BUT WE MUST INCREASE OUR LEVEL OF PROTECTION AGAIN FIRSTLY WE WILL KEEP OPERATING AT A HIGH LEVEL OPERATIONS CENTRE WHICH ALLOWS US TO MOBILISE TEN THOUSAND SOLDIERS IN ADDITION TO POLICE FORCES I'VE ALSO DECIDED TO
CALL UP OPERATIONAL RESERVES SO THAT WE CAN DEPLOY THEM ON ANY PLACES WE NEED THEM AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THE CONTROL OF BORDERS BUT FINALLY I'VE DECIDED THAT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WHICH WAS TO END ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF JULY WILL BE EXTENDED BY THREE MONTHS
I WAS PRESIDENT ON ON SPEAKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ON FRENCH TELEVISION PETER NORMAN IS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE STUDY OF RADICALISATION AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON I ASKED HIM WHAT HE MADE OF WHAT PRESIDENT HAVE HAD TO SAY IT SEEMS VERY HELPLESS AND ONE ALMOST FEELS A LITTLE BIT SORRY ABOUT TEN BECAUSE THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING HE CAN DO IT IF YOU
DRIVE A LORRY INTO A CROWD OF PEOPLE IT DOESN'T SEEM OBVIOUS HOW THE PRESENCE OF FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS COULD PREVENT THIS SO THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR HIM BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SIX OR SEVEN ATTACKS LIKE THIS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AN OBVIOUS SOLUTION IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANYTHING THAT HE CAN EASILY FIX
ONE OF THE THINGS HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS SECURING FRANCE'S BORDERS YES AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF SOLUTION CASE HAD THEIR PARENTS' ATTACKS IN NOVEMBER WHERE THE ATTACKERS CAME FROM BELGIUM BUT WE WILL HAVE TO SEE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHETHER THE ATTACKERS WERE COMING FROM OUTSIDE OR WHETHER THEY WERE ACTUALLY FROM NICE BECAUSE KNEES
FOR ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS AND WHO HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THIS HAS BEEN IF YOU WANT A G. HAD IT'S A BREEDING GROUND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WE WE'VE SEEN DOZENS OF PEOPLE WERE GOING FROM NICE TO THE ISLAMIC STATE TO SEE THE FIRST RECORDED ATTEMPTED ATTACK IN EUROPE WAS HAPPENING VERY CLOSE NEARBY IN CANNES
AND SO IT IS I THINK QUITE LIKELY THAT THE ATTACKERS WERE ACTUALLY COMING FROM WITHIN THE VICINITY OF RATHER THEN FROM BEING A BRIBE ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT FRANCOIS LONG TO SUGGESTED IS THAT THE
ATTACKS ON THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IN SYRIA AND IRAQ SHOULD BE RID DOUBLED IN SIZE AND INTENSITY THAT PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THIS THAT HE SAW IS PROSECUTING THAT WAR WITH MORE VIGOUR
AND THIS KIND OF MAKES SENSE IN THE SENSE THAT OF COURSE IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE ATTACKS WERE NOT SO CALLED LONE WOLF ATTACKS BUT THEY WERE DIRECTED FROM WITHIN SANDY IRAQ WHICH WE AT THIS POINT DO YOU NOT KNOW THEN IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO TRY TO ELIMINATE THE SORT OF SANCTUARY AND THEIR SORT OF SAFE HAVEN THAT ISIS ENJOYS AND C. N. IRAQ BUT OF COURSE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WHAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE SPECULATED A PAST YEAR OR SO IS THAT
AS IRAQ AND SYRIA BECOME LESS OF A STATE FOR ISLAMIC STATE OF THE ART ACTUALLY RESORTING TO MORE TERRORISM OR BRA AT THE ALMOST TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR THEIR FOR THEIR LOSSES IN C. N. IRAQ BY LASHING OUT IN EUROPE AND OTHER PLACES AND IN THAT SENSE
FIGHTING ISLAMIC STATE CAN C. N. IRAQ MAY ACTUALLY HAVE ALMOST THE OPPOSITE EFFECT AND YET THERE NEEDS TO BE DOESN'T THERE A POLITICAL RESPONSE
AS WELL AS A SECURITY RESPONSE CAN ABROAD RESPONSE AND FRENCH PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE BUT IT ALSO MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT BECAUSE HAVING BEEN TO FRANCE MANY TIMES SENSE THE FIRST ATTACKS IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THERE CHARLIE ADORE TAGS
IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THE FRENCH PEOPLE ARE IN DENIAL ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN DEPLOY AS MUCH SECURITY AS YOU LIKE YOU CAN DEPLOY A LOT OF SOLDIERS ON THE STREET IN FRANCE THE ULTIMATE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS A VAST FRENCH MUSLIM POPULATION IN FRANCE STEAD FEELS DEEPLY ALIENATED THAT HAS PRODUCED THIS PHENOMENON WE HAVE SEEN MORE PEOPLE GO FROM FRANCE TO THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
THEN FROM ANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRY IF YOU GO TO THE SUBURBS OF PARIS FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU HAVE SIMILAR PLACES IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE THEY'RE FEELING ALMOST LIKE UNGOVERNED TERRITORIES SO YOU HAVE ALMOST AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE FRENCH PROJECT AND WHENEVER WHENEVER A TERRORIST ATTACK LIKE THIS HAPPENS IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS THIS REALLY DEEPLY ROOTED PROBLEM
ANY FRENCH POLITICIANS DOING WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO START TO ADDRESS THAT TO BE HONEST I CAN'T SEE ANY END MY FEAR IS DAD IF ANYTHING THIS ATTACK WILL STRENGTHEN THE FAR RIGHT AND AS MARINE LE PEN AND ON BOARD TRYING TO CAPITALISE ON
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE ONCE THE FAR RIGHT TO WIN AND CAPITALISE ON THIS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY COME TO POWER FRENCH MUSLIMS WILL THROUGH EVEN MORE ALIENATED IT WILL POLARISE THE SITUATION EVEN MORE AND THEY WILL BECOME STRONGER AS A RESULT
THERE WAS PETER NORMAN FROM KING'S COLLEGE LONDON IT'S TWENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND OF COURSE MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN WRITTEN SINCE THEIR EARLY EDITIONS TO REFLECT WHAT'S HAPPENED IN NICE DOZENS KILLED US TERROR STRIKES FRENCH RIVIERA IS THE HEADLINE IN THE LATER EDITION OF THE TELEGRAPH WHICH DEDICATES MOST OF ITS FRONT PAGE
TO THE ATTACK THE PAPER SAYS A LORRY MOUNTED THE PAVEMENT AND ZIGZAG THROUGH THE CROWD THE DAILY MAIL DESCRIBED HOW THE WHITE LORRY RAN OVER PEOPLE AS THEY TRIED TO FLEE THE DRAMA UNFOLDED AS FIREWORKS FILLED THE NIGHT SKY EXPLAINS THE EXPRESS WITNESS TELLS THE PAPER NOBODY KNEW WHAT TO DO EXCEPT HIDEAWAY AS GUNMEN WERE RUMOURED TO BE TARGETING HOTELS
# THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE DATE OF THE ATTACK FRANCE'S NATIONAL DAY OF CELEBRATION IS SEEN A SYMBOLIC COMING ONLY MAKE EIGHT MONTHS AFTER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN PARIS THERESA MAY'S RESHUFFLE ALSO MAKES THE FRONT PAGES IT WAS THE MARCH OF THE MERITOCRATIC ACCORDING TO THE DAILY MAIL WHICH SAYS THAT MISSUS MAY LOADED THE CABINET WITH STATE EDUCATED MINISTERS DURING THE MOST BRUTAL DAY OF TOP LEVEL SACKINGS IN MODERN HISTORY THE DAILY TELEGRAPH REFERS TO THE STATE SCHOOL CABINET FOR THE GUARDIAN CABINET HAS TAKEN ON THAT IT PUT AS TO STINK THAT'S PRIVILEGED FLAVOUR
I AM LADY MAYOR YOU SWINGS THE AXES THE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY EXPRESS AS IT TALKS OF THE BOLDEST CABINET RESHUFFLE IN MEMORY THE TIMES AGREES THAT IT WAS A RUTHLESS CABINET KARL IT SAYS THERESA MAY'S SCYTHE THROUGH DAVID CAMERON'S ALLIES IN A PURGE MORE BRUTAL THAN HAROLD MACMILLAN'S NIGHT OF THE LONG KNIVES IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO FOR THE MAIL IT WAS THE DAY OF THE LONG STILETTO
# FINANCIAL TIMES BELIEVES THE DECISION BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO HOLD INTEREST RATES WAS A PAUSE FOR BREATH AND A CHANCE TO CALIBRATE ITS NEXT MOVE RATHER THAN A JUDGEMENT THAT THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE FROM PRAXIS HAS BEEN CONTAINED NOTHING'S REALLY LOST BY HOLDING ON FOR THREE WEEKS HUGGIES THE GUARDIAN AS THE BANK SHOWS THAT IT'S IN CONTROL OF EVENTS THE SOMETHING'S THE BANK'S DECISION MEANS ONE THING THAT THE APOCALYPTIC WARNINGS ABOUT THE ECONOMY BEFORE THE REFERENDUM OR JUST HYPE DESIGNED TO TERRIFY VOTERS
# AND THE MAIL AND THE EXPRESS REVEALED THAT DAVID CAMERON HIS FAMILY HAVE MOVED FROM DOWNING STREET TO A SEVENTEEN MILLION POUND TOWNHOUSE IN LONDON BORROWED FROM A FRIEND BUT SAYS THE EXPRESS THE MOVES ALREADY UPSET THE NEIGHBOURS ONE COMPLAINT SHE'S BEEN KEPT AWAKE AT NIGHT BY POLICE SLAMMING DOORS AND TALKING ANOTHER SAYS SHE LIKES DAVID CAMERON DOESN'T WANT HIM LIVING ON THE STREET BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY RISK

MORNING PAUL TAYLOR TELL US ABOUT THE THIS PARTICULAR DOCUMENT WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT AND WHY IT'S SO GREAT TO HAVE IT THAT WELL THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK ONE OF THE OBVIOUS ONES AS IT CONTAINS THREE OF THE KNOWN SHAKESPEARE SIGNATURES SO THAT HIS OWN HANDWRITING'S ON IT AND THEN BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE BEQUESTS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE WILL THAT TELLS US AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT HIS FRIEND HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY THE DEEP SORT OF PROVISIONS HE'S MAKING FOR THEM
AND GIVES US A REAL SENSE OF WHAT HE'S DOING TO PUT HIS AFFAIRS IN ORDER AND THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT NORMALLY ON DISPLAY BUT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF COMMEMORATIONS CELEBRATIONS THIS YEAR YOU YOU HAVE IT FOR JUST A FEW WEEKS YEAH IT'S A VERY SORT OF SPECIAL THING FOR THE TRUST TO HAVE THE WILL BACK IN STRATFORD AS YOU SAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS IT'S ONLY HERE FOR A FEW WEEKS BIG BECAUSE WE NEED TO PROTECT IT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO ENJOY AS WELL DOCTOR KATIE MAYOR YOU HAVE I NO BEEN ANALYSING IT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT IT ESTABLISHED WHAT
WHAT WE DID IS AFTER WE REALISED IT WAS GOING TO BE SUCH A BIG ANNIVERSARY YEAR WE DECIDED TO UNDO SOME OF THE PREVIOUS CONSERVATION TREATMENT TO RETURN IT TO MORE CLOSELY TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE THIS MEANT THAT THEN WE COULD TAKE IT TO THE BRITISH LIBRARY FOR WHAT'S CALLED MULTI SPECTRAL IMAGING AND THIS IS WHEN THE DOCUMENT IS EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT BANDS OF LIGHT
IMAGES ARE CAPTURED AND THEN YOU CAN SEE DETAILS THAT YOU CAN'T SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE AND THIS ALLOWED US TO SEE THAT THE DOCUMENT IS NOT A UNIFORM DOCUMENT THE INK IS NOT OF THE SAME TYPE ON THE DOCUMENT IN THE PAPERS DIFFERENT WHICH HAD LONG BEEN SUSPECTED BY SCHOLARS BUT ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO SEE IT WITH THE MULTI SPECTRAL IMAGING WE CAN THEN SEE WHICH SETS OF INK MATCHED TOGETHER SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONS WHERE HE'S ADDED AN EXTRA DETAILS ON PAGE TWO
OF BEQUEST TO HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND TO HIS THEATRICAL FELLOWS AND THESE MATCH DON'T MATCH OF EARLIER SET OF EDITIONS SO IT SUGGESTS THAT THE DOCUMENT IS BEING RE WRITTEN AND REVISED OVER A LENGTH OF TIME AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THE SIGNATURES ARE WRITTEN SIGNATURE OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE AND HIS LAWYER FRANCIS COLLINS ARE IN A DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER SIGNATURES AND ONE OF THEM IT WAS WEARING HER DEATHBED SIGNATURE WHICH SIT BY ME POSSIBLY THE LAST THING HE WROTE
IT LOOKS LIKE THE LAST SIGNATURE IS THE CLEAREST ONE AND THEN THE OTHER TWO PAGES OF THE WILL ARE ALSO SIGNED AND THEY ARE VERY WOBBLY SIGNATURES SO IT SUGGESTS THAT MAYBE THOSE ONES WITH THE LATER ONES PAUL TAYLOR WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY COPIES OF IT PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT IT IF THEY GO ONLINE AND WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL ABOUT HEADING TO YOU AND HAVING A LOOK AT THE REAL THING
I THINK IT'S GREAT TO BE ABLE TO READ IT ONLINE INTO THE EXPLORE THE CONTENT OF IT BUT THERE'S NOTHING COMPARES REALLY TO BEING UP CLOSE NEXT TO IT AND THINKING THAT SHAKESPEARE HAD THIS DOCUMENT IN HIS HANDS PROBABLY CHECKING IT THROUGH RIGHT ADDING A CYGNET HAS TO IT SO IT'S THE PHYSICALITY OF IT THE FACTOR IN THE SAME ROOM AS A DOCUMENT FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD THAT SHAKESPEARE HIMSELF HELD IN HIS HANDS AND WAS DICTATING THE CONTENT OF AN IN PREPARATION FOR IT YOU HAD TO MAKE CONSIDERABLE CHANGES I UNDERSTAND TO ENSURE THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO
I MEAN YOU IT YOU DON'T WANT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN TO PUT OFF IT'S TEA WHILE IT'S IN YOUR CARE NO OF COURSE NOT SO WHAT WE HAVE AN EXHIBITION SPACE WHICH IS SORT OF KITTED OUT WITH PROPER SHOWCASE HIS SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS AND ALL OF THOSE WERE ASSESSED AND CHECKED AND A FEW GRADES WERE MADE TO MAKE SURE THE WILL WOULD BE LOOKED AFTER JUST AS WELL IN STRATFORD AS IT WILL BE AT THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES NORMALLY
YES YOU MENTIONED SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS I SUPPOSE IT IS LITERALLY A PRICELESS DOCUMENT OH ABSOLUTELY SO IT'S A ONE OF A ONE OF A KIND THING YOU COULDN'T PUT A PRICE ON AND THE THREE WEEKS ONLY BECAUSE IT COULD FADE I SUPPOSE DOCTOR GETTING TO THAT'S A QUESTION FOR YOU REALLY ISN'T IT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO IT SO THE LIGHT A BIT
IT'S DANGEROUS FOR IT TO BE EXPOSED TO TOO MUCH LIGHT OBVIOUSLY THE CONDITIONS ARE VERY CAREFULLY CONTROLLED SO NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO IT AND IT WILL ACTUALLY COME BACK TO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF DISPLAY AFTER IT'S BEEN SHAKESPEARE TRES SAKE SPIT BIRTHPLACE TRUST BUT THEN YEAH IT WILL EVERYTHING WILL BE CHECKED HER CONDITION WILL BE CHECKED AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE PUT IN STORAGE FOR A GOOD FEW YEARS NOW
RESTED FOR TWENTY YEARS HE HAS HIS DOCTOR KATIE MAYOR PAUL TAYLOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS YOU CAN SEE THAT IN STRATFORD UPON AVON THE TIME THIRTY MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKING AND A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING'S CATHERINE PATTERNS TO THE EDITOR OF THE TABLET MORNING GOOD MORNING JUST
# WHEN THE CAMERON FAMILY WALKED OUT OF DOWNING STREET FOR THE LAST TIME ON WEDNESDAY I DETECTED THE ODD TEAR FROM THE CHILDREN THAT'S HARDLY SURPRISING THIS WAS THE PLACE THEY HAD CALLED HOME FOR MOST OF THEIR YOUNG LIVES IT WAS A REMINDER OF HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO LIVE SOMEWHERE SAFE AND SECURE THAT HELPS PEOPLE BOND AS A FAMILY
FOR MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY PARTICULARLY IN THE MOST POPULATED REGION OF LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST HOUSING IS NOT ABOUT SECURITY AND FAMILY HIGH HOUSE PRICES BENEFIT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A HOME OR HAVE A MORTGAGE BY MAKING MORE MONEY THAN PEOPLE CAN HOPE TO SAY FROM THEIR PAY
BUT EVEN THOUGH PRICES ARE FINALLY STARTING TO STALL AN INSTITUTE OF FISCAL STUDIES REPORT THIS WEEK SHOULD PRICES ARE STILL SO HIGH IN THE SOUTH THAT EVEN PEOPLE IN THE PROFESSIONS CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY AND OFTEN RAISING THEIR CHILDREN IN CRAMPED PRIVATELY RENTED ACCOMMODATION
SHELTER SAYS SOME PEOPLE PUT OFF HAVING A FAMILY AT ALL BECAUSE OF THIS COST WELL PROPERTY WEBSITE RIGHT MOVE SO AS GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO HELP PEOPLE BY FAMILY HOMES HAVEN'T WORKED SO FAR
BUT THE STRUGGLE TO FIND A HOME ISN'T NEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY THE NEED FOR SHELTER HAS BEEN ONE OF HUMANITY'S PERENNIAL PRIORITIES THE BIBLE CONFIRMS MANKIND'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS TO BOTH ITS NARRATIVES AND ITS METAPHORS
IT'S BOOKS OF THE STORY OF A DESERT PEOPLE AND ARE FILLED WITH REFERENCES TO THE NEED FOR WATER FOR FOOD FOR GOOD HEALTH FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF WAR AND HOPING FOR PEACE
THE SURROUNDINGS MATTERS TO THEM TOO THEY FIERCE STORMS AT SEA BUT THEY LOOK UP TO THE MOUNTAINS AS PLACES OF WONDER AND THEY NEED SHELTER AS WELL AS THE ACCOUNT OF JOSEPH AND MARY LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO STAY AND HAVING TO BED DOWN IN A STABLE REMINDS US
JESUS ASSURES HIS DISCIPLES THAT IN HIS FATHER'S HOUSE THERE ARE MANY DWELLING PLACES A METAPHOR BASED ON HOW IMPORTANT SOMEWHERE TO LIVE IS TO PEOPLE ALL THESE ISSUES REMAINS IMPORTANT TODAY PRISON BY THE CABINET MINISTERS WHO RUN THEM HEALTH FOOD IN THE ENVIRONMENT LAW AND ORDER AT HOME DEFENCE
EXCEPT FOR ONE FOR YEARS HOUSING HAS NOT HAD A CABINET MINISTER FOCUSED SOLELY ON THIS VITAL NEED BUT THERESA MAY THE NEW PRIME MINISTER THE STATED THAT HOUSING MUST BE A PRIORITY
PERHAPS AS A VICAR'S DAUGHTER SHE HAD SCRIPTURE READINGS AT SUNDAY AFTER SUNDAY SERVICE REFLECTING HOW IMPORTANT SHELTERS OR MAYBE THAT YEARNING STRUCK HER
A STABLE AFFORDABLE HOME NOT A GET RICH QUICK PROPERTY IS WHAT SO MANY PEOPLE NEED OR IS THE BOOK OF PROVERBS PUTS IT A CRUST OF BREAD IN A HOUSE OF LOVE
# AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH CATHERINE PATTERNS TO THE EDITOR OF THE TABLET THE TIMES TENT AWAY WHAT DOES A NEW MINISTER FOR BRECK'S IT DAVID DAVIS THINK OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. SHOULD LOOK LIKE WE KNOW FROM AN ARTICLE HE WROTE EARLY THIS YEAR MONTHS BEFORE HE GOT THE JOB THAT HE LIKES THE LOOK OF CANADA
HE WROTE THAT HE WAS TRAILED TRADE DEAL WITH CANADA WOULD BE A PERFECTLY GOOD STARTING POINT FOR OUR DISCUSSIONS I'LL CANADA'S TRADE MINISTER CHRISTIE AFR ELAND IS IN LONDON AT THE MOMENT AND HE'S HERE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING SARAH WOULD YOU MIND IF I START JUST BY EXPRESSING ON MY OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF CANADA HOW HEARTBROKEN WE ARE REPAID THE TRAGEDY IN NICE AND THEIR ARTEFACTS ARE REALLY WITH THE PEOPLE THERE AND WITH THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE INDEED
# AND ON THIS QUESTION OF THE TRADE DEAL THOUGH CANADA WHAT DO YOU HAVE TAKEN SEVEN YEARS TO NEGOTIATE YOU'VE YET TO SIGN BUT IT IS THERE IT'S BEING HELD UP AS A MODEL
FOR SOMETHING THAT THE U.K. COULD FOLLOW DO YOU THINK SUCH A DEAL WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE UK
WELL LOOK WE ARE REALLY PROUD OF OUR TRADE AGREEMENT IT'S CALLED SEATER WE CONSIDER THIS TO BE AND MANY PEOPLE DO A GALL TO STANDARD AGREEMENT IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST AMBITIOUS TRADE AGREEMENT THE E.U. HAS EVER NEGOTIATED AND FROM OUR STANDPOINT IT'S AN EVEN DEEPER A RELATIONSHIP THEN ARE NOW AFTER AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. AND MEXICO SO THIS IS A GREAT DEAL
AND WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD AS YOU MENTIONED SARAH TINK JET CEDAR SIGNED WE HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FAR
IMPLEMENTED WERE WORKING TO GET THAT DONE EARLY NEXT YEAR SO THE E. THE U.K. WILL BE PART OF CEDAR AND THAT'S GREAT OH BUT MY PARTICULAR QUESTION WAS REALLY SEATER MAY BE GREAT FOR CANADA BUT WOULD A SIMILAR DEAL DO YOU THINK WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE U.K. IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE
YOU KNOW WHERE THE U.K. HAS A BRAND NEW CABINET I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO YOUR DISCUSSION THERE AND THAT'S GOING TO BE FOR THEM TO JUDGE BUT WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO SHARE WITH THEM AND WE HAVE BEEN SHARING IT A TECHNICAL LEVEL YOU KNOW SOME REAL DETAILS OF EXACTLY HOW CEDAR WORKS WHAT THEY HANG HERE WE GO HAVE ALREADY GOT IN CONTACT WITH YOU AND SAID LOOK HOLD ON HOW DOES THIS WORK CAN WE COPY IT WELL WE'VE BEEN HAVING TECHNICAL EXCHANGES FOR SHIRT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING DOCTOR FOX THIS AFTERNOON
O.K. FOR THOSE OF US WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TECHNICALITIES OF IT CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT IT'S COMPLICATED WHAT'S TRADERS COMPLICATED SARA REALLY CLUMP IN IT WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED TRADE NEGOTIATORS IN CANADA AND WE DON'T HAVE SO MANY AND I GUESS THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST PROBLEMS
IT CERTAINLY TAKES A BIG VERY EXPERT TEAM TO NEGOTIATE TRADE AGREEMENTS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THEY ARE REALLY REALLY COMPLEX CEDAR IS ALMOST TWO THOUSAND PAGES CAN I ASK YOU THAT WHAT I WAS OR HAD BEEN GOING TO ASK IS FOR THOSE OF US OUTSIDE IN THE YOU KNOW THE DEAL WE CURRENTLY HAVE WITH THE E.U. WE'RE JUST WE'RE JUST PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IT'S A FORTY YEARS EFFECTIVELY HAVE LEGISLATION IN PLACE IF WE COPIED YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES FROM WHERE WE STAND AT THE MOMA
LOOK SEE THERE IS A GREAT DEAL AS TRADE DEALS GIRL BUT IT'S NOT MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. IT SAY SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
THERE ARE I MEAN IT'S JUST LIKE TIS THOUGH STOUR THERE ARE AMBITIOUS SERVICES AGREEMENTS INSIDE CEDAR BUT THE LEVEL OF ACCESS THAT THE U.K. HAS WITH PAST BREEDING IS NOT REPLICATED IN CEDAR AND SPORTING IS THE RIGHTS THAT BANKS THAT THE CITY OF LONDON HAS TO TRADE YOU THINK WE WOULD LOSE THAT
WELL CERTAINLY LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY AND THE ACCESS ON FINANCIAL SERVICES IN SEATER IS NOT AS CLOSE AS WHITE E.U. MEMBERS HAVE AMONGST THEMSELVES
AND ANOTHER AREA WHERE A CEDAR IS NOT AS AMBITIOUS EARS ON WEBER MOBILITY THERE IS SOME GOOD MOBILITY FOR PROFESSIONALS BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE INSIDE THE E.U. OF COURSE MANY PEOPLE IN THE U.K. WOULD LISTEN TO THAT AND THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT WE DON'T WANT SO MUCH MOBILITY
IN IN NEGOTIATIONS THE CANADIAN POSITION IS ACTUALLY TO ALWAYS BE VERY AMBITIOUS WITH MOBILITY WE THINK THAT THAT FACILITATES TRAY BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE CANADIAN VIEW AND THE CANADIAN CANADIAN BANKS WHO HAVE WHO HAVE HEADQUARTERS WHO HAVE SERIOUS OFFICES HERE IN LONDON IF THE U.K. DOES NOT KEEP ITS PAST SPORTING RIGHTS TO THE E.U. WOULD THEY MOVE
YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A LOT OF THINGS BUT I'M NOT IN CHARGE OF CANADA'S BANKS SO I'LL LEAVE IT TO THEM TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT CAN USE IT CAN YOU MIX YOU UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENTS IS IT I DO UNDERSTAND AND I'M JUST WONDERING THAT BECAUSE I'D BE WOULD SAY LOOK FINE WE TAKE A HIT BUT IT'S A PRICE THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PAY AND ULTIMATELY TWO YEARS DOWN THE LINE WOULD BE IN A BETTER POSITION
AGAIN YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE A JUDGEMENT FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO MAKE OH KAY OF COURSE
WHAT WE DO KNOW FROM DAVID DAVIES HE WROTE TWO WEEKS AGO IN IT WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT A RELATIONSHIP'S GOOD LUCK LIKE WAS THAT WE STOPPED STRIKING SOME BILATERAL TRADE DEALS HE POINTS OUT THAT THE FUR SHOULD BE STRUCK WITH THE U.S. CHINA AND CANADA
WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF TRADE BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES HOW QUICKLY DO YOU THINK WE COULD HAVE A NEW BILATERAL DEAL IN PLACE TO REPLACE THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENT WITH THE E.U.
WELL WHAT'S LUCKY WHEN IT COMES TO CANADA U.K. RELATIONS WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT A REALLY REALLY STRONG WE EXPORT ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION POUNDS' WORTH TO THE U.K. EVERY YEAR WE IMPORT ABOUT EIGHT BILLION AND ON INVESTMENT CANADIAN INVESTORS INVEST FORTY FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION POUNDS INTO THE U.K. EVERY YEAR SOUTH WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST FRIENDS WERE FAMILY
THE GOOD NEWS WAS
ON THE TIME WINDS A BIT SEEDY IS ON RIGHT NOW THE U.K. WILL BE A PARTY TO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A MEMBER OF THE E.U. SO WE ARE ALREADY ON A TRACK TO HAVE THE U.K. AND CANADA HAVE AN EVEN CLOSER A FOUNDATION FOR OUR TRADING RELATIONSHIP AND THAT WILL BE QUITE SIN AND SO WHAT DO YOU GOT A EARLY NEXT YEAR SO THE ARGUMENT IS WHAT YOU'VE GOT A READY OVEN DEAL THAT YOU CAN JUST SWAP FOR BUT AS A BI LATERAL RUN RATHER THAN ONE WITH THE
WELL AT THIS STAGE IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE SWAPPING IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE U.K. WOULD BE A PARTY TO AS A MEMBER OF THE E.U. BUT THEY WEREN'T IN FERMENTING
WELL YOU ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE ACCORDING TO WORK I AM SHEARING IN WHAT I BELIEVE ARE THE TECHNICAL CIRCUMSTANCES YOU'RE VERY LIKELY TO STILL BE EARLY NEXT YEAR WHEN SEATER WILL BE IMPLEMENTED
RIGHT AND SO YOU WOULD BE PARTY TO THAT AND SO THEN YOU KNOW THEN THE ISSUE WILL BE FOR THE U.K. AND THE E.U. TO FIGURE OUT THEIR OWN NEW TRADING RELATIONSHIP AND A PART OF THAT FIGURING OUT WILL BE FIGURING OUT HOW CEDAR WERE WORKS BETWEEN HISTORY PARTIES CRITTER PHELAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY PLEASURE THERE THREE MINUTES TO TO THE WEATHER

POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING IT HE WAS ACTING ALONE INSIDE THE LORRY OFFICERS SAY THEY FOUND GUNS AND GRENADES THIS WAS AN INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK TERRIFYING IN ITS BRUTALITY AND SIMPLICITY A VEHICLE USED AS A WEAPON OF WAR

MICROSOFT WAS BACKED BY THE LIKES OF AMAZON APPLE AND SISQO THEY SAID OF MICROSOFT HAD LOST IT WOULD HAVE SET A PRESIDENT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES' DEMANDING ACCESS THE SERVICE LOCATED BEYOND THEIR BORDERS
THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS CONSIDERING WHETHER IT WILL APPEAL AGAINST THE RULING IF IT DOES THE CASE COULD BE HEARD BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT OFFICIAL FIGURES SHOW CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW BY SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE THREE MONTHS BETWEEN APRIL AND JUNE AT THE SAME RATE AS THE FIRST QUARTER WHICH REPRESENTED THE SLOWEST PACE OF GROWTH SINCE EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND NINE DURING THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
# THANK YOU IT IS TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT IT TOOK ONE MAN TO BRING HAVOC AND TERROR TO THE CITY OF NICE LAST NIGHT WE STILL DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MUCH ABOUT WHO HE WAS BUT WE KNOW ALL TOO MUCH ABOUT THE SUFFERING HE CAUSED AND WE KNOW AS WELL THAT THE REACTION OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT OF THE FRENCH STATE WILL B.T. REDOUBLE ITS SECURITY EFFORTS BUT ALSO TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EXTREME DIFFICULTY OF DOING ANYTHING
IN THE SHORT TERM THAT MIGHT OFFER PROTECTION AGAINST AN ATTACK LIKE THIS THEY'D LAST NIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA PRAISED FRANCE AND AS HE PUT IT THE EXTRAORDINARY RESILIENCE AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES THAT HAVE MADE FRANCE AN INSPIRATION TO THE ENTIRE WORLD THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. TALKED OF ALL DEMOCRACIES BEING BESIEGED AND FACING A TERRIBLE THREAT
IN A MOMENT A FORMER FRENCH INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WE'RE HOPING TO TALK TO ABOUT WHAT TIME HE MAKES ABOUT THE EFFORT THAT THE PRESIDENT ON ON THE EXTRA EFFORT THE PRESIDENT ON ARMED ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT BUT FIRST LET'S TURN TO THE EVENTS OF LAST NIGHT AND WE'LL HEAR FIRST FROM KEVIN HARRIS WHO SAW IT UNFOLD FROM A NEARBY HOTEL
LYING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND IT'S TO THE LEFT THERE WERE MANY MANY BODIES THEY EAT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY AND THAT WAS THE PRIVATELY MUG WITH THAT ROUTE BUT THERE'S JUST NO HE WAS MOVING THAT WAS
I VERY QUICKLY I'LL BE TALKING TO ANOTHER CHASSIS IS THE JUDGE SAW NOT MY TIME BUT ALSO THE ATTACKER THEMSELVES I THOUGHT THE GUY FROM THE BEGINNING HE GOT RUN OVER LOOK AT PEOPLE AND WE'VE GOT A BEGINNING IT'S ALWAYS AN ACCIDENT I'VE HIM TAKING GOLD IN THE GARDEN UNDER TRYING TO SUGAR PUT IT WHEN YOU SAW OF
BUT THAT FILM AT EVERYTHING THE AND EVERYTHING BUT THERE'D BE PEOPLE ON BUT UP A BIT I WAS RUNNING WITH THE PEOPLE ON THE BEACH BECAUSE PEOPLE YOU COULD BLOW I ALREADY HAVE A PUB OR SOMETHING YOU CRIPPLE THE CAR AND KILL ALL THE PEOPLE AROUND HER DID YOU SEE
HOW QUICKLY DID THE POLICE SHOWED HIM HOW LONG DID HE HAVE TO SHOOT BEFORE SO IT WAS ALL RIGHT
I WAS NOT HER AL SHAFI WHO WAS THAT THERE LET'S TURN NOW TO FRANK GARDNER OUR SECURITY CORRESPONDENT AND FRANK STARTING I SUPPOSE WITH WHO THE KILLER WAS THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES SAYING VERY LITTLE DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA AT THE MOMENT
WE DO FROM WHAT THE FRENCH MEDIA IS SAYING THAT HE IS HE'S BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD TUNISIAN BORN FRENCHMAN WITH A A A KNOWN HISTORY OF PETTY CRIME BUT NOT ON THE TERRORISM WATCH LIST SO HE'S KNOWN TO THE POLICE OR SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THEFT AND VIOLENCE BUT NOT MOON TO HAVE ANY LINKS TO TO RADICAL IS MISSED GROUPS
HE WAS PROBABLY LOCAL THEY THINK THEY ARE NOW DESPERATELY TRYING TO FIND OUT IF HE HAD ACCOMPLICES THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN LOOKING AT HIS FINGERPRINTS ON DOCUMENTS LOOKING TO SEE IF ANYBODY HELPED HIM HARD THIS VEHICLE WHERE DID YOU GET THE WEAPONS FROM AND SO ON WAS HE ACTING ALONE
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN AN IMMEDIATE OF COURSE DISGUSTING REACTION FROM SUPPORTERS OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE CHEERING THIS VARY FROM USING A HASHTAG PRE FOR NICE WHICH IS IN OTHER WORDS PRAYED FOR TO CELEBRATE THE ATTACK RATHER THAN FOR MOURNING THE VICTIMS
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THIS ISN'T CLAIMED IN SOME WAY BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY CALLED FOR
SOME SOME MONTHS AGO THEIR SPOKESMAN UPPER MUHAMMED I'D LOVE MONEY CALLED FOR EXACTLY THIS KIND OF THING SO SAME TIM POLLARD WITH EXPLOSIVES YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN DO THINGS LIKE THIS BUT
I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO A TIGHTENING UP OF SECURITY AND A LOT OF EUROPEAN CITIES YEAH I MEANT ON THE SUBJECT OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE CALLING FOR IT AND IN A SENSE OF IT HAPPENING PERFORMING THERE HAVE BEEN THESE TYPES OF ATTACKS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKED TO AN EXTENT DISMISSED HAVEN'T THEY BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HAD KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE NUMBER ONE BUT ALSO THAT THE PEOPLE INVOLVED HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE MENTALLY UNSTABLE AND IT WASN'T QUITE SURE WHETHER HE'S TERRORISM OR NOT I'M THINKING BACK A COUPLE YEARS TED TO DIJON TO TOUR YES
EXACTLY AND YOU OF COURSE WERE A PARIS CORRESPONDENT C. PROBABLY FOLLOWED HIM MORE CLOSELY THAN OTHERS THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE HAVE BEEN WARNINGS OF THIS BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ANYBODY HAS DONE IT ON SUCH A SCALE AND SO EFFECTIVELY
AND I THINK WHAT REALLY MATTERS NOW IS IS TO FIND OUT HOW OR SEVERAL THINGS WAS IT IN'T IT WAS IT INTO YOU CONNECTED TO TWO OFFICIAL TERRORIST CALLS I'D BE SURPRISED IF IT WASN'T HOW WAS HE ABLE TO
GET HOLD OF THIS VEHICLE AND DRIVE IT INTO SUCH A CROWDED PLACE THERE WERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOWN THERE AT THAT TIME IT'S EXTRAORDINARY IF YOU LOOK AT IT THE BARRIERS THAT AROUND SO THAT THE HOUSE THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER THEY WENT UP IN TWO THOUSAND THREE TO STOP ANYBODY DOING SOMETHING LIKE CRASHING A VEHICLE INTO THE HOUSE OF THE PARLIAMENT PEOPLE WILL NOW BE LOOKING AT THOSE PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES
TO STOP THIS KIND OF THING UNFORTUNATELY THIS KIND OF SELF STARTING ATTACK HAS BECOME THE NEW PATTERN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND IT'S ALMOST CERTAINLY IN RESPONSE TO THE MILITARY PRESSURE
THAT SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IS UNDER IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE LOSING TERRITORY EVERY DAY AND SO THEY'RE LASHING OUT AT SOFT UNDEFENDED TARGETS LIKE THIS AND IT'S NOTABLE THAT A LOT OF THE VICTIMS WERE CHILDREN

THAT GEORGE WAS ONE OF MARK KIND DID A BRILLIANT JOB IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REFERENDUM RESULT A STABILISING MARKETS USING THAT PLANNING BUT WHAT NO ONE COULD DO A COURSE IN ADVANCE WAS WORK OUT ALL THE THINGS WHICH ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK HARD OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS TWO YEARS AND IN TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET THAT GET THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS READY TO NOT LEAST TO START THE NEGOTIATIONS
WE OF COURSE HANDED CONTROL BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE WE HANDED OVER CONTROL OF TRADE DEAL NEGOTIATIONS TO THEIR KNEES SEE HOW MANY TRADE NEGOTIATORS DO WE HAVE WELL YOUR WRAPS IT RIGHT THE TRADE NEGOTIATORS WHOAH BRITS AT THE MOMENT ARE BASICALLY WORKING FOR THE ONE OF HOW MANY OF THEM QUITE A NUMBER BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THEY'RE EMPLOYED THERE
AND IT'S UP TO THEM WHETHER THEY'RE RECRUITED INTO WHITEHALL THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY EXPERIENCED TRADE NEGOTIATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD AS WELL DO WE HAVE ANY HERE NO NO WE DON'T HAVE TRADE NEGOTIATED A TRADE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON IN THE YEAR SO WE'LL HAVE TO HIRE A WHOLE DAVID DAVID'S GOING TO HAVE TO HIRE A GROUP TO DEAL WITH THE E.U. NEGOTIATIONS AND LIAM FOX OF COURSE WHAT I THINK IS AN EXCELLENT PLAN OF THERESA'S TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE IS ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO HIRE A GROUP OF
TRADE NEGOTIATORS AND THEN I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY SOME OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED ONES WILL NEED TO BE USED PROBABLY TO TRAIN UP A CADRE OF YOUNGER CIVIL SERVANTS AND THE WORK HAS ALREADY BEGUN IN FACT BEGAN ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO TWO TO ENSURE THAT THE EXPERIENCE STRAIGHT NEGOTIATORS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE BRIGHTEST AND THE BEST OF THE CIVIL SERVICE WHO THEN OF COURSE WE WILL
IT WAS ALWAYS DOES COLLECT A HUGE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE YOU MAKE THE POINT ABOUT WE HAVE DAVID DAVIS OF COURSE TAKING ON YOUR ROLL LIAM FOX TAKING ON THIS TRADE ROLE AND OF COURSE BORIS JOHNSON AS FOREIGN SECRETARY NOW YOU KNOW ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS THEY ARE NOT KNOWN AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOT ON IN THE PAST CAN YOU SEE IT WORKING OH TOTALLY YES FIRST WILL THEY'RE ALL THREE VERY TALENTED INDIVIDUALS SECONDLY ACTUALLY POLITICIANS ARE TERRIBLY GROWN UP I REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD WHEN WE STARTED I KNOW I KNOW
THE MEDIA NEVER QUITE BELIEVE US BUT ACTUALLY WHEN WE STARTED THE COALITION BACK IN TWENTY TEN WHICH I WAS INVOLVED IN FORMING I WAS TOLD BY ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY WISE AND OLD IN THE MEDIA AND ELSEWHERE THAT IT COULD NEVER LAST YOU COULDN'T DO IT POLITICIANS COULDN'T OF COURSE WE COULD MANAGE IT THE TRUTH IS WHEN YOU FACE A NATIONAL CRISIS OF THE KIND WE FACED IN TWENTY TEN OR A NATIONAL CHALLENGE OF THE KIND WE FACE TODAY
POLITICIANS COME TOGETHER AND WORK IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST AND GET THINGS DONE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT ANY ORDINARY INSENSIBLE GROUP PEOPLE DO POLITICIANS ARE VERY GOOD AT DOING AND REALISTICALLY THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAVE GIVEN THAT WE ARE STARTING FROM SCRATCH HOW LONG
WILL IT TAKE HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE BEFORE WE CAN START HAVING MEANINGFUL NEGOTIATIONS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY AT THE MOMENT CAN COMPLETE DETAIL BUT I I UNDERSTAND THE DAVID DAVIS HAS SUGGESTED THAT WILL TAKE A FEW MONTHS TO GET HER THINGS SORT OF COOKED TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN BEGIN A PROPER NEGOTIATION AND THEN PROBABLY A COUPLE OF YEARS TWO TO INTIMATE THAT THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A VERY SENSIBLE STARTING POINT IT WILL ONLY KNOW AS WE GO ALONG JUST HOW TRICKY THIS TURNS OUT TO BE AND HOW LONG IT TAKES
DO YOU ARE CONFIDENT HANDING OVER TO HIM ARE YOU THAT HE'S THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB WE KNOW THAT HE SAID YES I MEAN I'VE KNOWN FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND NEGOTIATED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THINGS WITH THEM AND I TELL YOU HIS JOLLY TOUGH COOKIE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED AND WE ALSO NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S COMMITTED TO THE TASK WHICH HE CERTAINLY IS AND SOMEBODY WHO'S ANALYTICAL POWERFUL AND HE IS DEFINITELY THAT
YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIBED AND YOU MAKE THE POINT ABOUT YOU DO GO BACK TO THE EARLY DAYS OF DAVID CAMERON YOU WERE DESCRIBED AS THE GANDALF OF THE PROCESS OF FORMING POLICY FOR HIS FIRST GOVERNMENT YOU BACKED HIM AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY WHEN YOU SAW WHEN YOU SAW WHAT THERESA MAY DID OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS DID IT FEEL LIKE A PURGE OF THE CAMEROON'S TO YOU WELL THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT HE WAS DOING WHAT I THINK I WOULD HAVE DONE AND HER PLACE WHICH IS TO PUT HER OWN STAMP ON A NEW CABINET AND MAKE A CLEAN BREAK AND
GO THE ACTION SHE TRYING TO GO WHEN YOU BECOME ELECTED AS LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY I THOUGHT SHE WAS MANIFESTLY THE RIGHT PERSON TO DO THE JOB AT THIS POINT YOU ARE ENTITLED TO LEAD THE PARTY IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT LEADERSHIP I THINK EARLY STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT SHE'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE A TREMENDOUS THAT THERE'S DEFINITELY BEEN AMBITION TREES AND I GO BACK EIGHTEEN YEARS OR SOMETHING IN BOTH OF US HAVE BELIEVED FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME THAT SORT OF COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM IS THE ANSWER
AND SHE SET THAT OUT AND SHE'S DRIVING TOWARDS IT SHE'S UNITING THE PARTY SHE'S BROUGHT PEOPLE FROM EVERY KIND EVERY PART OF THE PARTY TOGETHER I THINK SHE'S DOING THE RIGHT THINGS AND BOTH OF YOU HAVE BELIEVED THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WHAT HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD ENOUGH BECAUSE WHAT WAS INTERESTING AND STRIKING HEARING HER WAS WONDERING WHETHER IS THIS SOMETHING THAT SHE SAT QUIETLY AND CABINET THINKING AND FEELING ANGRY ABOUT OR IS IT A SORT OF CONVERSION AS A RESULT OF THE BRECK'S IT VOTE WHERE SHE'S THOUGHT PEOPLE ARE VOTING NO BECAUSE
THEY'RE ANGRY AT LOSING OUT FROM ANY BENEFITS OF NOT LEAST IMMIGRATION I DON'T THINK IT'S EITHER OF THOSE THINGS IN THE SENSE THAT FOR THE WHOLE OF THE TEN YEAR OLD DAVID CAMERON AS PRIME MINISTER WE DROVE TOWARDS TRYING TO BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER AND TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES ARE LIFE CHANCES OF PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT ACTUALLY UNITES THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AT THE MOMENT I MEAN I THINK YOU'LL FIND ONE HUNDRED PER CENT ARE CONSERVATIVE M.P.S BEHIND THAT LIFE CHANCERS STRATEGY AND WHAT SHE'S RECOGNISED IS THAT A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED
WE'RE ACTUALLY VOTING ABOUT THEIR OWN PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND SHE'S POINTING OUT THE NEED TO GIVE THOSE PEOPLE THEIR LIFE CHANCES WHICH WILL ENABLE THEM TO FEEL PART OF IT HAVE A STAKE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE RIGHT KIND OF WAY AND THAT'S CLEARLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND YET BUT WHAT SEEM SO STRIKING ABOUT THAT IS THERE SHEEP SHE MADE THAT POINT ABOUT COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM SHE SAID SHE NEEDED TO REUNITE THE PARTY EVERYBODY ACCEPTS THAT AND SHE'S BROUGHT IN HER RIVALS IN THE PROCESS BUT THOSE SHE'S BOOTED OUT AH
ALL THE CAMEROON'S THOSE WHO WERE TIGHT AROUND DAVID CAMERON ALMOST A REJECTION OF THE LAST FEW YEARS OF THIS GOVERNMENT I DON'T IT'S QUESTION OF REJECTION OF THE LAST FEW YEARS IT'S JUST THAT WHEN YOU CHANGE THE BLOODY CHANGE THE GUARD I DON'T THIS IS A NATURAL PROCESS I'VE MORE OR LESS EVERY WORKING DAY OF MY LIFE FOR THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS I'VE HAD CONTACT WITH DAVID CAMERON THROUGH THE DAY IT'S A VERY IT WAS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT THING THAT THERE WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE TRYING TO
PRODUCE A PARTICULAR WAY OF GOVERNING WHICH THE WHOLE CABINET BOUGHT INTO IT AND IT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT PROPONENTS OF ALL THOSE THINGS BUT OF COURSE WHEN YOU CHANGE YOU HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER THEY WANT THEIR OWN PEOPLE AROUND THEM AND THEY WANT TO DO THINGS HER OWN WAY AND IT'S RIGHT THAT SHE SHOULD DO THAT

# WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE A BIT WET IN THE NORTH BRIGHTER IN THE SOUTH AND THE EAST YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE TIME FOR A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM CAROLINE NICHOLS
AT LEAST EIGHTY FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE FRENCH RESORT OF NICE AFTER A LORRY WAS DRIVEN AT CROWDS WATCHING A FIREWORKS DISPLAY TO MARK BASTILLE DAY AN EYE WITNESS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THE DRIVER OPENED FIRE ON POLICE WHO SHOT HIM WHEN HE REFUSED TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE WITHOUT MAKING ANY ATTEMPT TO NEGOTIATE WITH HIM PRESIDENT ALARM SAID WHAT HAPPENED HAD ALL THE ELEMENTS OF A TERRORIST ATTACK THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN FRANCE IS BEING EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER THREE MONTHS

# LYING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND IT'S GOT THE LEFT THERE WERE MANY MANY BODIES THEY EAT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY AND THAT WAS TO PRIVATELY MUG WITH THAT ROUTE BUT THERE'S JUST NO HE WAS MOVING THAT WAS
LET'S TURN TO AS HIM ELDER FRY AWAY WHO IS A POLITICAL SCIENTIST AND EXPERT IN JIHAD AS AND JOINS US NOW ON THE LINE AND WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN HEARING DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME IS THAT ACTUALLY
NICE IS A HOT BED AND A REALLY A PLACE IN WHICH RELATIONS ARE VERY POOR AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS ARE POOR AND IN A SENSE THIS ISN'T A SURPRISE WOULD YOU GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT'S TRUE
LIKE THAT WOULD GO WITH THAT
AND THE REGION ABOUT ME AND THE REGIONAL MUCH TOGETHER I REALLY RANKING ROUTE AND POTTERY LIKE IN THE TOP THREE DEPARTURES ABSURD YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOU'D FELT A PROBLEM AND IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT YOU TO LATENESS MARBLED LIKE ABBA WHICH A POINT I'D LET YOU TRY A MUM WELL IT'S HISTORY IT'S A
WHETHER HE'S DEAD OR ALIVE I'VE DONE THAT MAN ALMOST YEAH I'LL BE A GIANT EYE LOOKS ONE WHICH MEANS THE LOCAL KINDER BRAHMS AND TO YOU AND YOU LOOK VERY PRETTY AND IT WILL TELL YOU IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
UM
BUT THE WORK IS BEING DONE IS IT COVERS WHAT WE WERE HEARING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME FROM NATALIE GU LAYERED SENATOR IN THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT IS IS THAT IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR FRANCOIS LONG TO TALK ABOUT SECURITY MEASURES AND UNDERSTANDABLE BUT ACTUALLY SHE SAID LOOK WE'VE ALREADY GOT A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND THIS HAPPENED DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY WE NEED TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS IN OTHER DIRECTIONS YOU MADAM IS TOTALLY RIGHT
WAKE UP CALL AND COME ON
I THINK THE PURPOSE WAS MOULD WE'LL EXTRICATE AND
IT'S HAVING TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH
HOW MANY WAKE UP CALL STUFF HAS GOVERNMENT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AS WELL DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US
# IT'S NOT TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE THE GOVERNMENT I LEAD WILL ALWAYS BE ON YOUR SIDE THAT WAS THE MESSAGE FROM THE NEW PRIME MINISTER THERESA MADE TO PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND SHE'S GOING TO BE HEADING THERE TODAY FOR MEETINGS WITH THE FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE E.U. AND THE UNION STEWART HOSIE IS THE S. M. PEAS DEPUTY LEADER AND HE'S IN DUNDEE GOOD MORNING MORNING AND SHE WILL BE TOLD WHAT BY NICOLA STURGEON EH SHE WILL BE GREETED
GENTLY I THINK THERE'LL BE A CORDIAL YOUR CONVERSATION I'M SURE THE FIRST ONE SO I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON HER ELECTION TO BECOMING PRIME MINISTER AND THEN WE'LL GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY WHICH IS
THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE THOUGHT IT TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BY HIS SIGNIFICANT DECREE THAT POSITION THAT STATUS WITHIN THE E.U. HAS TO BE MAINTAINED
WE KNOW THOUGH THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S DISMISS THAT THE IDEA THAT SCOTLAND WOULD HAVE A SEPARATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET AND WE KNOW THAT THE BRECHT'S IT MEANS BRECK'S IT WHAT'S O.K. HE'S LEAVING THE E.U. SO HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THOSE TWO WAS THE PRIME MINISTER SAID BREAKS IT MEANS BREAKS IT AND PHILIP HAMMOND DID SAY THERE'D BE NO SEPARATE ARRANGEMENT FOR SCOTLAND I HAVE TO SAY I THOUGHT THAT WAS A RATHER DEFINITIVE STATEMENT IS RATHER BOXED HIMSELF INTO A CORNER
TO SEE SUCH A DEFINITIVE THING HAVING BEEN IN THE POST BUT THEY WERE TWENTY MINUTES I THOUGHT WAS SLIGHTLY FOOLISH SO WHAT THE
FIRST AS WHY WHY BECAUSE IF HE STICKS IF THE GOVT IF THE GOVERNMENT IN WESTMINSTER STICKS TO THAT LINE WHAT WILL HAPPEN THE FIRST MINISTER HERE SET UP A STANDING COUNCIL ON EUROPE TO EXPORT EVERY POSSIBLE OPTION TO MAINTAIN SCOTLAND STATUS WITHIN THE Y. YOU KNOW NO ONE KNOWS PRECISELY WHERE WHERE THAT'S GOING TO LET THEM DO THE WORK FAST BUT I THINK IT WAS FOOLISH OF PHILIP HAMMOND TO SEE NO CATEGORICALLY AT THE VERY BEGINNING HAVING BARELY BEEN IN THE JOB
UNTIL THE COMMISSION HAS REPORTED IF THEY SAY THERE'S A WHEEL WHICH THIS CAN BE DONE THEN I THINK PRAGMATICALLY PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT TO SIMPLY SLAMMED THE DOOR AT THIS POINT IT IS NOT A VERY SMART THING TO DO POLITICALLY OR ECONOMICALLY I MEAN THERE IS SOMETHING THAT PRESUMABLY IS WEIGHING ON ALL SIDES IN THIS WHICH IS AS WE WERE HEARING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME THAT THE STARS ARE NOT ALIGNED AT THE MOMENT
FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM YES YOU MAY HAVE THE MORAL YOU MAKE THE POINT A BIT SCOTLAND VOTED TO REMAIN BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ISN'T YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MANY OPTIONS
WELL LET'S SEE WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE FIRST OF ALL BUT THAT'S THE FIRST MINISTER HAS SAID YOU KNOW IF IT REQUIRES SCOTLAND TO BECOME INDEPENDENT TO MAINTAIN OUR STATUS IN THE E.U. AND THEN WE'LL LOOK AT HOW WE ACHIEVE THAT BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW I WAS SIMPLY TRIED TO MAKE SURE
WE CAN STAY IN THIS MARKET ARE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE THAT WE RETAIN THE RIGHT TO FREE TRAVEL WE RETAIN ACCESS TO THAT MARKET WITHOUT TART OF BARRIERS ALL OF THE THINGS WHICH I'D LIKE HER TO COME BY BECAUSE OF THE DECISION TO BREAKS IT BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT IS
IF WE'RE BEING ASKED TO RESPECT THE WISHES OF THOSE WHO VOTED TO LEAVE AND WE DO THEN THE U.K. GOVERNMENT NEED TO RESPECT THE WISHES OF SCOTLAND WHO WANTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO STEER HIM BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS SURELY AN ARGUMENT FOR
WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WHETHER DAVID DAVIES CAN SECURE OR SOMETHING THAT THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND ULTIMATELY JUDGES O.K. WE CAN LIVE WITH THAT
I THINK THESE NEGOTIATIONS WILL GO ON OF COURSE THE WILL AND WE'LL TRY TO BE AS CONSTRUCTIVE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL WITH IF THAT'S WHERE WE END UP
BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE U.K. GOVERNMENT MINISTERS TALK ABOUT BI LATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT OF GERMANY AT THIS COME IN THE NEXT COUNTRY THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE E. U. WORKS THERE'LL BE NOT BILATERAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.K. AND INDIVIDUAL E.U. COUNTRIES THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE A U.K. Y. YOU TRADE DEAL AND I CAN IMAGINE A LARGE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES INSIDE THE EE YOO HOO SEEING THIS THING
PUSHED AND PULLED IN ALL DIRECTIONS BECAUSE OF THE BREAKS HER DECISION NOT BEING DREADFULLY KEEN ON HAVING A FAST TRACK FOR THE U.K. BUT THEY WILL HAVE FROM THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS FROM THEIR OWN PEOPLE FROM THEIR OWN BUSINESSES PRESSURE TO SORT SOMETHING OUT FOR JOBS AND ULTIMATELY IT WILL BE IN THEIR INTEREST TO COME TO SOME SORT OF DEAL
WHAT ONE WOULD HOPE SO I'M ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT PRESSURE WILL BE THE OTHERS NO QUESTION THAT'S THE CASE BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS PRESSURE FOR ME A CONSTITUENT ON HER BUSINESS FOR SOMETHING TO BE DONE DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NEGOTIATING TABLE IN FRANCE OR GERMANY OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN EUROPE
I'M GOING TO SEE THINGS IN EXACTLY THE SAME WEIGHT OF WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW I WAS PART OF THE E.U. IS UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THAT MARKET THAT'S BEEN PUT AT RISK AND OUR DETERMINATION SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION IS THAT'S MAINTAINED FOR SCOTLAND STEWART HOSIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE TOTTENHAM RIOTS OF TWENTY ELEVEN BEGAN WITH A SINGLE EVENT SHOOTING OF MARK DUGGAN CHEERING WHAT IS CALLED A HARD STOP POLICE SEARCH AND THE FILM HAS BEEN MADE IT'S CALLED THE HEART STOP AND IT EXPLORES THE EVENTS OF THAT DAY AND
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS AS WELL AND GEORGE AND FONTS FOR IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEART STOP IS HERE AND SO IS MARCUS KNOCKS HOOK WHO WAS A FRIEND OF MARK DUGGAN A CHILDHOOD FRIEND OF MARK DUGGAN AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO STARTED THE RIOTS MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING MARKERS NOT HOOK FIRST OF ALL TELL US ABOUT THE EVENTS TELL US ABOUT THE LINK THAT THERE WAS BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED TO MARK DUGGAN THAT DAY AND THE FIRST SMASHING OF POLICE GUARD
SO ON FOUR FOR MORE WAS SHORT MY POLICE ARE NEAR DON'T KNOW POLICE HAD COME TO HIS HOUSE OBVIOUSLY INFORM HIS FAMILY DO OBVIOUSLY HAD BEEN SHOT WELL COME IN FISH WHICH WAS THE FRIDAY THERE WAS STILL NO NEW STUD OR POLICE TO STILL NO NEWS ON PLEASE COME TO THE FAMILY HE NEVER STILL NEVER HEARD NOTHING REWARDING SITUATION
SO FROM FRIDAY EVENING RUBICON DECIDED WE WILL GO DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION ON SATURDAY TO OBVIOUSLY FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIM SO SATURDAY WE COVERED ON YES THEY'RE ON THE WALL OR FOREMOST
UM I MEAN I MEAN WHAT DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION I MEAN THE CROWD WAS MADE UP OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN MAINLY THERE'S NO MY MUM WAS THEN WHAT'S MY MOST
UM SO WE'VE GONE TO THE POLICE STATION
MORE FROM WANTS KIDS SOMEONE SOON SHE WENT AT A POLICE STATION TO REPORT HE'S DEAF AND TOWARDS OR ASK QUESTIONS ON THE POLICE HASN'T COME ROUND TO HIS MUM'S HOUSE TO OBVIOUSLY
FROM THE THUNDER DAYS DEAD SAW IT SHE WAS INFORMED UP SOME COMMISSION OF POLICE WAS GOING TO COME AND SPEAK TO HER AND TO JUST BASICALLY JUST WITH HER OWN SO AFTER SIX HOURS OF WAITING
OFFICER IN UNIFORM CAME OUR BASES HAD A COMMISSIONER PLEASE CAN'T MAKE IT AND IT WILL GAIN CONTROL OF THE DAY AND TO BASICALLY CLEAR THE STREETS WHAT DID YOU DO THAT
OBVIOUSLY ANTICIPATE IN THE OFFICES ARE OVAL UM COS I WAS I WAS KEEN TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH MARK
I WAS JUST DEVASTATED AT THE FRONT DOWN WAS HE WAS A COMING TO SPEAK TO US SO UM I KIND OF JUST TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO SAY WELL ALL RIGHT
BEFORE IT IS HER OR DON'T I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING SO ONE TOTTENHAM WAS PLAYING ON THAT DAY AND THERE'S A LOT OF OFFICERS ON THE STREETS OF THEM DOING CROWD CONTROL
SO I SAID THAT BEFORE I LEAVE HERE I'M GONNA I SUPPOSE ATTACK ON A LIMB AND UM WHAT DID YOU DO IT SO
A CORONER CON COUPLE GUYS AND SAID OUT GOING TO THE THE OWN GO ON BY THE POLICE COME BETWEEN YOUR FIRE IN AND STUFF LIKE THAT I SHOULD OFFER THE WOODEN OFFICE WOULD HAVE CAME OVER
WHEN THEY'RE OUT OF SEASON ORDER OF FROM RIGHT GEORGE I'M BERNZY YOU YOU TOOK THAT AS THE STARTER
OF YOUR FILM ANY USE AM I RIGHT IN THINKING IT IS BASICALLY SYMPATHETIC IN THE SENSE THAT IT IT SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES OF THAT RIOT AND TO LINK THEM VERY CLOSELY TO WHAT HAPPENED THERE WITH MOUNT UP
YES THERE IT IS I THINK IT'S SYMPATHETIC IN THAT IT IS
IT WAS ALWAYS MY INTENTION TO TRY AND EXPLORE THE HUMANITY OF THE MAN HE'S DEATHS SPOT THE U.K. RATS COS I FELT THAT WAS SOMEWHAT MISSING IN THEIR NEWS REPORTS
THAT CAME OUT SUBSEQUENT MOCKED UP AND STEP WHETHER THE NEWS REPORT SUGGESTED HIM IT'S NOT REALLY DISPUTED IZZY DID THAT HE WAS HIMSELF SOMEONE WHO HAD BEHAVED VERY BADLY IN THE PAST AND HE WASN'T A SYMPATHETIC CHARACTER DUPER TREMORS THAT WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU WATCH THE FILM THE HARD STOP IT'S REALLY A FILM THAT FOLLOWS MARCUS AND CURTIS WHAT THAT WAS TO CHILD FRIENDS SO OF COURSE
IN THE FILM YOU GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON MOCK YOU ALSO GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THEIR OWN LIVES GROWING UP WITH MARKED UP AND AND AND AND WHAT THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE NET NO POINT TRIED TO PORTRAY THEMSELVES ALL MOCKED UP IN THOSE ANGELS THEY WERE IN THE FILM THEY'RE VERY VERY FORTHRIGHT AND OPEN ABOUT THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WITHIN THE FILM YOU ALSO GET TO KNOW THESE GUYS AND I THINK THE TRUTH CAN BE FOUND
IN WHAT THEY SAY BUT ALSO WHAT YOU SEE THEM DOING I WANT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE LISTENING MIGHT IT WILL HANG ON THE TRUTH IS THAT HE HAD A GUN IN THE CAR AND THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF VIOLENCE INCLUDING BUNS THAT MARCUS WAS INVOLVED WITH THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED
IF THAT WAS THE CASE AND DON'T WE KNOW TWO THINGS FROM THE INQUEST VERDICT AND THAT TO CONCLUSIONS WERE DRAWN ONE THAT HE DID NOT HAVE A GUN IN HIS HAND WHEN HE WAS SHOT BUT IN THE CAN'T COUNTY BUT HE'S LAWFULLY KILLED NOW UP IF HE HAD A GUN IN THE CAR BUT I DON'T THINK
JUSTIFIED TO HIM BEING SHOT TWICE AND KILL
BECAUSE IF SOMEONE HAS A GUN IN THE CAR OR IN A SUITCASE OR THEY HAVE HOW CAN THAT PERSON PRESENT A THREAT IF THEY THEN X. I'M NOT GOING INTO WHETHER IT WAS JUSTIFIED OR NOT BUT JUST WHETHER THE FILM WILL BE SEEN BY SOME PEOPLE AS AN ATTEMPT TO TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS THAT THIS WAS IN A WAY UNDERSTANDABLE AND GREW IN A WIDER SENSE JUSTIFIABLE WHEN ACTUALLY IT WASN'T REALLY
WON'T EVEN JUST TO WANT GEORGE WAS IN THERE WAS NOT EVIDENCE TUNNELS HAVE GONE IN A CORE BALLISTA AND EVEN THE PATHOLOGIST COULDN'T EXPLAIN HOW THE GUN WAS FOUND
WHEN YOU FEEL AWAY FROM HIS BODY YEAH BUT THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE CAR AND HAVE BEEN THROWN AWAY WHEN ASSUMPTION IT'S NOT FOR US ALL RIGHT AND ASSUMPTION THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK PERFECTLY REASONABLE BUT I JUST WONDER FROM YOUR OWN ACTIONS AS WELL WHETHER I MEAN IT IF SOMEONE WATCHES THIS FILM WHO IS GENUINELY NEUTRAL ON WHAT HAPPENED THEN AND TOTTENHAM WELL WILL THEY WHAT IS THE ADDED PICTURE THAT THEY WILL GET THAT THERE MIGHT NOT HAVE AT THE MOMENT O.K.
REMEMBER TO EIGHTY FIVE
IN THE WIND THE FIRST BALL OR FORM ROWERS CINCHES SUTURED GERRIT WAS CURED OBVIOUSLY I WOULD HAVE BEEN ME MARK AND THE EVER POSTER AN IPHONE COAST WOULD HAVE BEEN A MAP FOR
SO OBVIOUSLY SINCE IT SEEMS TO THEREFORE P.C. BLAKELOCK I MEAN LIKE I SAY IN THE FILM YOU GET HIM PLEASE PLEASE HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT ON MY ESTATE AND IN BIG NUMBERS AND ALWAYS HARASSED PEOPLE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OBVIOUSLY WHAT HAPPENED P.C. BLAKELOCK AND OBVIOUSLY I GREW UP INTO INTO I BECAME OFF AN AGE WHERE POLICE ARE RUNNING LOST NO ONE THAT I CAN ALSO PRESS AND ASKED TO GET MY SHOULDERS ARE SOMETHING THAT KIND OF GREW INTO SOUL
THE FILM IS ABOUT IS ABOUT THE STATE OF RELATIONS AS YOU SEE THEM IN TOTTENHAM AND RELATIONSHIPS JUST FINALLY VERY BRIEFLY FOR GEORGE RELATIONS THAT ARE AS BAD TODAY AS THEY WERE WELL GIVEN THE
CONCLUSION OF THAT THE DUCK ON THE VERDICT AS I'VE JUST SAID WHICH IS THAT HE WAS LAWFULLY KILLED YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT COMMUNITY WHICH HAVE HAD THIS HISTORY AND IT HAS AS THEY SAY A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE GOING BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE FOR THE REGIONAL BROADWATER FARM RIGHT
THEY IT DOESN'T I DON'T SUPPOSE INTENDED THEN WE HAVE A FEELING OFF OF HOPEFUL OH K. THE FUTURE LEGALLY BUT THEY'RE GEORGIAN ANSWER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MARCUS KNOCKS OUT HOW COS WELL THANKS PAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES TONIGHT SOMEONE TOOK A PHOTO OF DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AT A CAFE IN LONDON YESTERDAY AND SOMEONE TOLD THE DAILY MAIL THAT MISTER CAMERON LOOKED CHEERFUL BUT MISTER OSBORNE LOOKED DEFINITELY SUBDUED HE LOOKED THOUGHTFUL AND WELL OF COURSE HE MIGHT HE RAN THE ECONOMIC AFFAIRS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MAJOR POWERS FOR SIX LONG YEARS
AND NOW VERY SUDDENLY HE DOESN'T WHAT SHOULD HISTORY'S FIRST TAKE BE ON GEORGE OSBORNE THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER FOR A SHARE SHARMA IS HARE'S HEAD OF EMERGING MARKETS AND GLOBAL CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST AT MORGAN STANLEY AUTHOR OF A BOOK CALLED THE RISE AND FALL OF NATIONS AND JUDITH THAT IS WITH US AS WELL AS MANAGING EDITOR OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES MORNING TO YOU BOTH
YOU'RE FIRST TAKE GILLIAN TETT SUCCESS OR FAILURE WELL FROM AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE AND SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN NEW YORK MY SIR TIME HIS MAIN SUCCESS IS MAKING THE U.K. ECONOMY SEEM FANTASTICALLY BORING UNTIL ABOUT A MONTH AGO HE INHERITED AN ECONOMY VERY TRAUMATISED BY THE PETROL CRISIS AND HAD A LOT OF STABILITY
OTHER SMALL THINGS HE DID HE SUPPORTED DEVOLUTION IN A POLITICAL SENSE SOMEWHAT SURPRISING BECAUSE IT GAVE POWER TO SOME OF HIS OPPONENTS ANNUALS IT'S MOTHER QUITE UNRECOGNISED THINGS I WAS DOWN AT EXETER UNIVERSITY YESTERDAY AND THEY POINTED OUT HE HAD BEEN A FANTASTIC DEFENDER OF THE SCIENCE AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUDGET AS WELL SO QUITE A MIXED BAG BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE HE MADE THE U.K. ECONOMY LOOK PRETTY BORING FOR QUITE A LONG TIME DID HE ALSO CHALMERS SOME HIS CRITICS SUGGEST
A GOAT TOO HARD TOO FAST WITH THE EFFORTS TO CUT THE ANNUAL DEFICIT TO EVENTUALLY PAY DOWN THE DEBT AT A STAGE WHERE HE DIDN'T NEED TO DO
YES YOU CAN ARGUE THAT HE DID THAT BUT I THINK THAT WAS MORE BARK THAN BITE BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF FISCAL CONSOLIDATED THAT HAPPEN UNDER HIS WATCH IT WAS NOT THAT AGGRESSIVE AS HE'S MADE OUT OF THESE I THINK IT'S DAWN WAS VERY SHARP BUT HIS ACTIONS WERE MUCH MORE MUTED AND ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND TERM I THINK THAT HE WAS BEGINNING TO TRIANGULATE WAS SO UNDERSTAND THAT INCOME INEQUALITY IS A BIG ISSUE HE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT SO DOCKING ABOUT HIGHER MINIMUM WAGES AND STARTS I THINK THAT HE WAS MUCH MORE BARK THAN BITE REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT
HIS ACTUAL TRACK RECORD DO YOU GREAT AND I DO AND I THINK UNTIL A FEW MONTHS AGO HE HAD DONE A RATHER CLEVER SLEIGHT OF HAND IN THAT HE PERSUADED INTERNATIONAL MARKETS OF THE U.K. WAS IN THAT EMBARKING ON AUSTERITY AND THAT'S ONE THING HELPED TO KEEP THE MARKET SO CALM AND YET THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF AUSTERITY SHE SAYS WASN'T THAT GREAT AND ECONOMY CONTINUED TO GROW QUITE IMPRESSIVELY STILL I THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE POTENTIAL CUTS TO TAX CREDITS OR CAUSE NEVER
IT HAPPENED IN THE END OF THAT YOU COULD SAY IS IT IS A POLITICAL ERROR BUT IT'S ALSO POTENTIALLY WASN'T IT AS EVIDENCE THAT THAT PHRASE WERE ALL IN IT TOGETHER REALLY WASN'T THE CASE WHEN IT CAME TO HATE HIM AND HIS HIS POLICY WELL POTENTIAL REALLY IS A KEY WORD HERE IN THAT MOST THE CUTS DIDN'T HAPPEN AND I THINK WHEN HISTORY LOOKS BACK AT GEORGE OSBORNE HAS TWO POINTS FIRST OF ALL WE WON'T KNOW HOW HISTORY JUDGES HIM UNTIL WE SEE HOW THE CURRENT THE NEW CROP ARE LEADERS DO
IF THEY MESS UP DRAMATICALLY IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS HE WILL LOOK PRETTY STABLE AND GOOD IF THEY ACTUALLY TAKE BRETT AND TAKE THE PART THE BRECHT'S IT AND DELIVER A STRONG GROWTH AND IT WON'T SEEM QUITE SO DAZZLING BUT SECONDLY HE'S SOMEBODY WHO WAS ABOVE ALL ELSE A PRAGMATIST HE WAS A VERY PRAGMATIC MANAGER AND HE WASN'T A GREAT IDEA AND OTHER SUCH IN MY VIEW
AND ALTHOUGH HE TALKED ABOUT BENEFIT CUTS AND THINGS IT WAS AS MUCH ABOUT TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE DEBT PROBLEM RATHER IMPOSES A STRONG IDEOLOGICAL VISION OF WHERE THE ECONOMY SHOULD GROW IS HIS GREATEST FAILURE BRITISH ARMOUR THAT HE DIDN'T PREVENT BRECK'S
YEAH I THINK THAT SUMMER POLITICAL STANDPOINT IT IS BUT I FEEL HE DONNED NOISE TO WHAT HE COULD'VE DONE FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME BECAUSE AS I SAID A BIT IN MY BOOK THAT THERE'S A MASSIVE ANTI ESTABLISHMENT WAVE RUNNING ACROSS THE WORLD TODAY SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE POPULARITY RATINGS AS WE DO OFF DEED LEADERS IN THE WORDS TWENTY LARGEST DEMOCRACIES DOES THAT AT AN ALL TIME LOW TODAY
AND THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY TELLING IT IS A VERY POWERFUL ANTI ESTABLISHMENT WAVE AND I THINK THAT BREAKS IT GOT SORT OF QUITE UP IN THAT WHAT IS IT IS IT A WAVE THOUGH THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF PEOPLE IN OTHER WORDS IF IF THOSE CONDITIONS OF THOSE IF THEY'VE BEEN A SENSE GENUINE SENSE THAT GLOBALISATION WAS WORKING FOR EVERYONE AND THAT YOU COULD HAVE MADE IT WORK FOR EVERYONE COULD COULD COULD THAT SORT OF POLITICAL
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE BEING UPSET AND ATTACKING GOVERNMENTS COULD THAT BE BROKEN YES IT IT COULD BE HAD WHAT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS FACING TO IT IS THAT THIS IS THE WEAKEST RECOVERY IN REINFORCED WHAT HISTORY AND INCOME INEQUALITY HAS COME UP TO BE A REALLY BIG ISSUE WHICH IT WAS NOT A DECADE AGO AND IN THAT REGARD HE SEEMED A BIT INSENSITIVE
WITHOUT ISSUE WITH THE FACT THAT INCOME INEQUALITY HEAVILY EMERGED AS A VERY BIG ISSUE BUT I MUST GO BUT ONE THING IN CONTEXT HERE WHICH IS WE MUST ALWAYS LOOK AT THIS IN TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS AND IN THAT REGARD THE U.K.'S GROWTH RATE UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP WAS PRETTY MUCH STUFF THE HIGHEST FOR ANY DEVELOPED COUNTRY
SO IT'S A VERY WEAK ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACROSS THE WORLD BUT THE GROW THROUGH THAT YOU COULD ACHIEVE UNDER HIM WHERE'S RELATIVELY HIGH COMPARED TO OTHER KIND WOULD HAVE DONE MORE GILLIAN TETT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THAT GROWTH OR MORE EQUALLY SPREAD HE CERTAINLY GOT IT DONE I SUSPECT HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE IF YOU'D STAY IN OFFICE FOR LONGER THE TRAGEDY IS THAT ONCE HE STARTED GETTING DREAMS OF BEING PRIME MINISTER WE HAD THE OMNI SHAMBLES BUDGET AND THEN WE HAD THE RIDICULOUS
POST BRECK'S IT BUDGET THREATS A FEW WEEKS AGO WHICH WAS TERRIBLY TONE DEATH AND THE POINT AT WHICH I WAS MAKING ABOUT THE ANGER OF PEOPLE NOT NECESSARILY EQUATING TO THE REAL CUT ECONOMICS ALWAYS IN MANY WAYS WAS CAPTURED BY THAT BRECHT'S THAT THREAT BUDGET BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY HE WAS WARNING PEOPLE TRY AND HE'S A BIG STICK AND IT WAS ONCE AGAIN THE ELITE LECTURING A BIT ORDINARY VOTERS WITH QUITE NASTY BACKLASH EFFECT
