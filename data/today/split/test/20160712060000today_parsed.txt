COMPLEX MULTI VITAMINS WERE UNLIKELY TO BE NEEDED I'M AN UNNECESSARY EXPENSE HOWEVER PRODUCERS HAVE MULTI VITAMINS TO SURVEYS WHICH SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF POTENTIAL MOTHERS DON'T CONSUME ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF NUTRIENTS LIKE IRON AS PART OF THE OVERALL DIET

# THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHRIS IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THE MORNING'S PAPERS I SUSPECT THEY WANT TO KEEP A SET OF THESE IN THE MAY HOUSEHOLD NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY ALL MARK THE DAY ON WHICH THERESA MAY EMERGED AS OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER BUT BECAUSE IT MAY BE THE LAST DAY SHE GET SUCH EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG AND POSITIVE COVERAGE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY NEWSPAPER
MAY DAY IS THE HEADLINE IN THE ONLY NEWSPAPER MAY TAKES FAST TRACK TO NUMBER TEN IS HOW THE GUARDIAN PUTS IT MOST THEM CAN'T RESIST HAVING A PRIME MINISTER OR A PRIME MINISTER ELECT WITH ONE SYLLABLE NOT THREE BUT THE MALE PREFERS CORONATION OF TERESA WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE BIG KISS PLANTED ON HER CHEEK BY HUSBAND PHILIP YESTERDAY OUTSIDE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
THE SUN DUBS HER MAGGIE MAY IN AT NUMBER TEN IT SAYS AND IT'S HEADLINERS HEEL BOYS OVER A PICTURE YES YOU GUESSED IT OF THOSE KITTEN HEELS THE TELEGRAPH CALLS IT THE BEST DEAL FOR BRITAIN ONLY THE DAILY MIRROR HAS A NEGATIVE TONE TO ITS HEADLINE A NATION IN CRISIS IT SAYS AN EARLY ELECTION BRING IT ON IS ITS HEADLINE QUOTING WORDS SHE USED THERESA MAY THAT IS
WHEN GORDON BROWN BECAME PRIME MINISTER WITHOUT HOLDING A GENERAL ELECTION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ITS LEADER COLUMN WARM MISSUS MADE IT THAT SHE WILL BE GUILTY OF NAUSEATING HYPOCRISY AS THEY PUT IT IF SHE DECIDES TO SQUAT IN NUMBER TEN FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS UNTIL MAY TWENTY TWENTY BEFORE GOING TO THE POLLS BUT MOST OF THEIR LEADER CALLED ONES ARE PRAISING THEE
THE TIMES SAYS MISSUS MADE NOW COMMANDS A POLITICAL STAGE ON WHICH THE ONLY LEADING BEX SETTEE HERE LEFT STANDING IS ONE WHO PRETENDED TO BE HER REMAIN ANDY'S GRAVELY WOUNDED JEREMY CORBIN BRITAIN STILL HAS NO OPPOSITION BUT AT LEAST IT'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN CHOSEN
AND IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THE STATE OF THE NATION RESTS ON HER SHOULDERS THE GUARDIAN DESCRIBED WAS A KNOWN UNKNOWN THIS IS MAY COMES TO THE PREMIERSHIP PROMISING CONFIDENCE UNITY A NEW IDEAS YESTERDAY'S SPEECH WAS A DOWN PAYMENT ON THAT BUT COLD ECONOMIC WINDS MAY END HER HONEYMOON VERY QUICKLY SHE IS IN SOME WAYS THE MOST INTERESTING AND HARD TO READ TORY LEADER SINCE JOHN MAJOR WHAT DONALD RUMS FELT WOULD'VE CALLED A KNOWN UNKNOWN
BUT SHE COMES TO OFFICE AT A TIME THAT WOULD HAVE CHALLENGED THE CHURCHILL A DELIGHTFUL CARTOON BY PETER BROOKES AS EVER DELIGHTFUL IN THE TIMES CAPTURES HOW SHE MADE ITS POWER RED CARPET TREATMENT IS THE HEADLINE OVARIES THE RED IN THIS CASE IS A POOL OF BLOOD EMERGING FROM THE DOOR OF NUMBER TEN AND THERESA MAY IS TIPTOEING IN THOSE KITTEN HEELS OVER THE BODIES OF MICHAEL GO MOVE WITH A DAGGER IN HIS BACK ANDREA LED IN THE DAGGER IN HERS BORIS JOHNSON ONLY DAVID CAMERON HAS A DECK
IN HIS FRONT BUT THAT IS HOW SHE SEEMS TO HAVE COME TO POWER ACCORDING TO HIM AT LEAST IT WAS NOW TEN PAST SIX I WONDER HOW LONG THAT KITTEN HEELS THINGS WERE LOWER WELL QUITE A LOT AND WHAT IS INSTINCT JOHN ISN'T IT IT'S TO SEE HOW THE CARTOONIST WILL CAPTURE AND THERE'S A DEFINITE LOOK OF MARGARET THANK YOU THERE IS DEFINITELY THE WAY JULES SOME OF THE CARICATURE BUT THEY ARE
# YEAH AND IT'LL SIT WITH HER FOR A LONG TIME I SUSPECT ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE RIFT IS FINALLY OVER NO NOT THE RIFT IN THE TORY PARTY THIS IS THE RIFT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE UNITED STATES THE HE GAVE HILLARY CLINTON THE RUN OF A LIFE WILL FINALLY INDOORS AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HERE'S BERNIE SANDERS OF COURSE AND GARY O'DONAHUE IS THE B.B.C.'S WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT
MORE THAN A YEAR INCOMING THIS THEY'VE BATTLED IT OUT THROUGH THE THE PRIMARY AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS PREPARED TO PUT HIS WEIGHT BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON INTERESTING THING WILL BE JUST TO WHAT EXTENT HE WILL DO THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY FULL BLOODED ENDORSEMENT THE OPTICS IN THE CHEMISTRY WILL BE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING BUT I CAN YOU CAN BET YOUR BOTTOM DOLLAR THAT SHE WOULDN'T HAVE AGREED TO DO THIS EVENT IF SHE HADN'T HAD SOME PRETTY COPPER BOTTOMED ASSURANCES ABOUT HIS LOYALTY GOING FORWARD
AND IMPART THAT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS A GREAT GULF BETWEEN THEIR POLICY POSITIONS WASN'T IT ARE THERE ANY SIGNS THAT THEY HAVE GROWN CLOSER TOGETHER
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS HAS BEEN A REAL WRANGLE OVER WHAT THEY CALL THE PLATFORM FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN THE WEEK AFTER NEXT THAT EFFECTIVELY IS THE SORT OF POLICY DOCUMENT THE PARTY PRETENDS TO RUN NO ONE'S ACTUALLY BOUND BY IT AND BERNIE SANA'S CAN POINT TO A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE FOR EXAMPLE HE'S GOT A COMMITMENT FOR A FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR OVER TIME BEAR IN MIND IT'S SEVEN
TWENTY FIVE AT THE MOMENT SO THAT'S QUITE A A SORT OF ASPIRATIONAL TARGET IF YOU LIKE THE VERY VERY POPULAR ON WHAT THEY CALL THE PROGRESSIVE LEFT HERE AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME KEY AREAS IN EDUCATION HEIGHT HAVE FUNNY OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND HEALTH POLICY WHERE SHE HAS MOVED TOWARDS HIM SO HE HAS EXTRACTED SOME SIGNIFICANT STUFF WILL IT MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT SHE WILL HAVE TO SORT OF RUN TO THE SENSORS
DATES DOING AMERICAN ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH DOES SHE NEED HIS SUPPORTERS AND ALL THE SIGNS THERE THAT SHE'S GOING TO GET THEM SHE DOES NEED THEM I MEAN THESE ARE THE YOUNG THE INVIGORATED WE SAW THEM AT HIS RALLIES SEVENTY HOT YEAR OLD WHISKERY OLD SENATOR FROM FROM VERMONT PRODUCING THESE HUGE CROWDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE
SHE DOES NEED THEM TO COME OUT PARTICULARLY THE YOUNG WOMEN THAT SUPPORTED BERNIE SADA SHE WILL FEEL SHE NEEDS HE PHONE ME BECAUSE ONE OF HER BIG PROBLEMS HIS HOW DO YOU SELL A CLINTON PRESIDENCY HAD AN IMAGE OF A SORT OF VISION FOR THE FUTURE ON SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG ON ONE WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO INVIGORATE THAT THE YOUNG AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE YOUNG ARE PREPARED TO VOTE FOR HER SO IT DOES MATTER TO HER GARROW DONNY THANK YOU
# FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE CLIMATE CHANGE COMMITTEE HAS PRODUCED ITS LATEST WARNING ON THE EFFECT OF GLOBAL WARMING ROGER HE'S OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS FLOODING THE DOMINO EFFECT THAT IT WILL CAUSE AND DAMAGING THE U.K.'S INFRASTRUCTURE
YES JOLLY NICE OF THE OFFICIAL ADVISORS TO THE GOVERNMENT THE GUARDIANS OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE ACT IF YOU LIKE AND THIS REPORT WILL INFORM THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT WHICH IS COMING IN JUST OVER A YEAR'S TIME AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF FLOODING AS YOU SAY AND THE DOMINO EFFECT IN FACT THEIR PHRASES
CASCADING RISKS ON INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHAT HAPPENS FOR INSTANCE NOW WE KNOW RATHER BETTER ABOUT THIS COS WE SAW IT HAPPENING IN LANCASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE DURING THE WINTER FLOODING IS THAT WHEN A BRIDGE GOES DOWN FOR INSTANCE IT'S NOT JUST THE BRIDGE THAT GOES DOWN IT'S THE GAS PIPES ON THE BRIDGE THE ELECTRICITY CABLES ON THE BRIDGE THE I.T. CABLES ON THE BRIDGE AND KIND OF RECKON THAT BEFORE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THIS COASTAL FLOODING ON A ROAD FOR INSTANCE TO A POWER STATION WILL MEAN THAT POWER STATION CAN'T GET IN COLD FOR INSTANCE OR
WOOD PELLETS IN THE CASE OF DRAX THE COMMITTEE SAYS THAT WE'VE REALLY GOT TO GET A LOT SMARTER AT SEEING HOW THESE KEY BITS OF INFRASTRUCTURE LINKUP TOGETHER AS THE CLIMATE WARMS AND ON THE THE RISK OF FLOODING THEY THEY BASED THAT ENTIRELY DO THEY ON WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE OCEANS THE OCEANS RISING
MORE RAIN OR WHAT WELL OCEANS OCEANS AND RAINFALL TO JOHN I MEAN THESE ARE PROJECTIONS BUT BASED ON THE BEST SCIENCE AND THEIR UNCERTAIN BUT THE POINT ABOUT THIS REPORT HE'S THAT IT'S LOOKING AT RISKS IN OTHER WORDS WHAT HAS THE GOVERNMENT GOT TO PLAN FOR WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT NEED TO THINK ABOUT IN FUTURE IS THAT AS THE TEMPERATURE RISES I MEAN THEY'RE A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS JOHN THAT HAVE COME UP THE LIST OF PRIORITIES HER SINCE THIS LAST ASSESSMENT FIVE YEARS AGO
ONE OF THEM I THINK IS INTERESTING IS HIS FARMING IT MENTIONS THAT THE BEST SOILS IN ENGLAND THE FENNEL AND SOILS WHICH WE'VE LOST EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE PEAT LANDS AT THE MOMENT IN THE FENS BECAUSE OF DRYING OR SOIL BEING WASHED AWAY IN HEAVY RAIN AND BECAUSE OF DRAINAGE THEY THINK THAT ALL OF THE SOILS WILL BE GONE THE PETE WILL BE GONE WERE TO THIRTEEN SIXTY YEARS UNLESS FARMERS CHANGE THE WAY THEY FARM BUT THAT WILL MEAN RULES OF COURSE AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THIS GOVERNMENT WILL WANT TO IMPOSE RULES ON THAT SORT OF THING
AND THE OTHER INTERESTING AREA WHERE I THINK RULES ARE AT PLAY IS IN THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WOULD YOU ALSO GONE UP THE AGENDA IN TERMS OF IMPORTANCE WITH AN AGEING POPULATION THEY'RE FORECASTING THAT THEY COULD BE A TRIPLING OF THE AMOUNT OF HOT WEATHER DEATHS AND WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IS THAT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ON FUEL EFFICIENCY TO SAVE PEOPLE'S BILLS AND TO STOP PRODUCING UNNECESSARY MISSIONS THE CHEAPEST WAY FOR BUILDERS TO BUILD BUILDINGS HAS BEEN TO BUILD THEM WITH SMALL WINDOWS
AND SMALL WINDOWS DON'T LET IN A LOT OF AIR IF HE'S GETTING VERY HOT SO THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE SIR JOHN KREBS PROPOSED TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT BUILDERS SHOULD BE ENFORCED TO HAVE PLENTY OF VENTILATION BUT HE WAS TURNED DOWN ON THE GROUNDS IT WAS TOO ONEROUS TO BUILDERS SO THIS CAN BE SOME TRICKY POLICY ISSUES AROUND THIS ROGER THANKS A LOT
# IT IS COMING UP TO SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX WHAT ON EARTH DID SHE MEAN BY THAT IT'S GRISHAM WE'RE GONNA FIND OURSELVES ASKING QUITE A LOT ABOUT THERESA MAY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WEEKS AND MONTHS YESTERDAY MORNING BEFORE WAY BEFORE SHE KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO BE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER MISSUS MAY HAD QUITE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT HOW BUSINESSES SHOULD BE RUN DOMINIC O'CONNELL HAS BEEN LOOKING AT WHAT SHE SAID AND OF COURSE AS THE REST OF THE BUSINESS STOP IT WAS JUST BEFORE ANDREA LEAD SOME WITHDREW SHE MADE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE CAME UP WITH A QUITE A FEW BIG IDEAS FOR BUSINESS
AND SHE ALSO AND PASSING MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE NO BACKSLIDING ON BRICKS IT THE NEED FOR STRONG PROVEN LEADERSHIP TOO
THROUGH WHAT WILL BE DIFFICULT AND UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL
THE NEED OF COURSE TO NEGOTIATE THE BEST DEAL FOR BRITAIN IN LEAVING THE E.U. AND TO FORGE A NEW ROLE FOR OURSELVES IN THE
EXIT MEANS BRECHT'S IT AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A SUCCESS OF IT
BUT WHAT REALLY MADE BOSSES SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE WILL HER PLANS FOR CHANGES IN THE WAY COMPANIES ARE RUN SHE WANTS A GOVERNMENT TO HAVE POWER TO STOP TAKE OVER BIDS SHE WANTS SHAREHOLDERS TO HAVE BINDING VOTES AND EXECUTIVE PAY AND THE ONE THAT I THINK WILL REALLY PUT A SHIVER THROUGH SOME BOARDROOMS TO PUT EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES ON BOARDS IT'S QUITE COMMON IN GERMANY BUT QUITE ALIEN TO THE BRITISH BOARDROOM WITH ME ARE SIRRAH HIM CHARLES PARTNER IN THE CITY OF ORPHAN ELLEN OVARY SHE SPECIALISES IN EMPLOYMENT LAW
SO LET'S GO BACK TO BASICS ON THIS SHE'S TALKING ABOUT EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES ON BOARDS THAT MEANS I'D HAVE TO BECOME DIRECTORS BUT ADRIC DOMAIN SOMETHING'S QUITE SPECIFIC IT DOES THERE ARE LOTS OF MARKETING DIRECTOR'S PAPERCLIP DRAPER'S OR SOMETHING BUT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT LEGALLY AT LEGAL DIRECTOR WHAT WHAT AS A DIRECTOR
YES THAT'S RIGHT SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THE TITLE OF DIRECTOR BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MEAN THEY SIT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING PEOPLE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY THEY'RE THE PEOPLE THEY DECIDE THE STRATEGIC DIRECTION OF THE COMPANY THEY TAKE THE BIG DECISIONS ON WHERE THE COMPANY MAY INVEST IT'S MONEY WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THE COMPANY'S GOING TO PURSUE
AND LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE WHEN THINGS GO WRONG AS WELL YES THEY ARE YES ABSOLUTELY THEY HAVE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THEY WILL BE CALLED FI DE SRI DUTIES TOWARDS THE COMPANY WHO APPOINTS THEM AT THE MOMENT HE HAS THE POWER TO APPOINT YOU DIRECTOR I DIRECTORS EITHER APPOINTED BY SHAREHOLDERS OR THEIR APPOINTED BY THE OTHER DIRECTORS ON THE BOARD TO THE COMPANY'S VERY SELF REGULATE IT SO THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF DISCRETION ESTHER ESTHER WHO CAN BE A DIRECTOR SAY THEORETICALLY AS MAY THERESA MAY'S PLAN COULD HAPPEN QUITE QUICKLY YOU COULD JUST TELL PEOPLE TO A POINT
AND CLEARER PRISONERS AND THAT WOULD HAPPEN YOU NEED TO HAVE A MANDATORY CHANGE IT WHAT IF IT'S GOING TO BE A MANDATORY APPOINTMENT YOU NEED TO HAVE A CHANGE IN THE LAW TO SAY COMPANIES HAVE TO HAVE EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE BOARD
IF IT'S VOLUNTARY THEN THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO BE A LEGAL CHANGE AND COMPANIES THINK HE JUST DECIDE HOW MANY EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES THEY WANTED TO HAVE FROM WHAT SHE SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE SHE WANTED TO BE COMPULSORY SHE SAID IF I'M PRIME MINISTER WE'RE GOING TO HEAD CONSUMERS REPRESENTED ON COMPANY BOARDS AND WORKERS AS WELL THAT DIDN'T SOUND TO ME LIKE A A VOLUNTARY TARGET THAT SATELLITE COMPULSION YES I AGREE AND THERE'S YOU MENTIONED THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE GERMAN MODEL WHERE IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATION A THIRD OF YOUR SUPERVISORY BOARD
IS MADE UP OF EMPLOYEE REPRESENT THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STRUCTURE ISN'T IT THEY HAVE TWO SETS OF BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD AND THAT AND A BOARD UNDERNEATH WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF IT SO IT'LL BE A GIANT UPHEAVAL TO THE WAY OUR COMPANIES ARE RUN YES THAT'S RIGHT YOUR THEY HAVE A TEAT HERE SYSTEM WHERE IS IT THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT'S BEEN PROPOSED HERE IT WOULD BE EMPLOYEES BEEN PUT ONTO THE MAIN BOARD AND THEN DECISION'S BEEN TAKING IN THEIR UNANIMOUS MAJORITY VOTE WAY SO IT WOULD REQUIRE BIGGER PEOPLE AND COMPANY BOUGHT AND WHAT ABOUT CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVES OF THE THING
WHAT HOW DO YOU FIND A CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE GONE ABORT I GUESS IT'LL BE DONE IN A SIMILAR WAY TO NON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO PUT THEMSELVES FORWARD FOR THOSE POSITIONS WILL DO SAY THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE ON THE SEA OF KNOWING THE COMPANY WELL HAVING WORKED WITH THEM AND DONE BUSINESS WITH THEM IN THE PAST AND HOPEFULLY HAVING SOME EXPERIENCE OF THAT INDUSTRY
THANK YOU CYRIL INCHES FROM ALAN ELLEN AND OVARY WITH ME NOW TO DISCUSS THEN THE REST OF THE MARKET A MARKET CAESAR'S JUSQU'A GROUND THE EQUITY FUND MANAGER AT SCHROEDER'S JESSICA THE OTHER THING THAT TERESA MAY DID YESTERDAY WAS MOVE THE MARKET WHEN WE KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED SHOT UP IT'S NOW AND THEN LIVE A MONTH HI THIS ONE THE NOSE THAT KNOWS HOW TO MAKE MARKETS MOVE DOESN'T SHE WELL I THINK IT'S QUITE A LOT OF IT'S BECAUSE MARKETS REALLY DON'T LIKE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AS EXCITING AS IT MAKES THE TODAY PROGRAMME
FOR MANAGERS REALLY STRUGGLE STRUGGLE WITH IT SO I THINK THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD A SHORT IN PROCESS WE KNOW WHO THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER IS AND PEOPLE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO START LOOKING IN MORE DETAIL AT HER POLICIES IS HELPFUL AND I THINK WHAT WAS MOST INTERESTING ABOUT THE MARKETS ARE SOME OF THE SECTORS THAT HE'D SOLD OFF THE NOSE SAID THE REAL ESTATE AND THE HOUSE BUILDERS WHICH HAVE BEEN REALLY
DEEPLY HIT ON BREAD IT CONCERNS SO A BIT OF A BOUNCE BACK AND IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE AGAIN THE OTHER PART OF THE MARKET THE MOOD WAS SORT OF THE SMALLER COMPANIES WHICH AGAIN HAD BEEN VERY BADLY WHICH SHOULD BE QUITE REASSURING FULL OF US SHOULDN'T IT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THEN INTERNATIONAL AND THIS ARE THINKING THAT THE U.K. ECONOMY ACTUALLY MAY NOT BE VERY BADLY HURT IF IT HAS A BIT
A PERIOD OF PROPER LEADERSHIP I THINK THAT THE REALLY KEY THING WILL BE OUR ABILITY IN THE U.K. TO ATTRACT INWARD INVESTMENT AND DEFINITELY WITH THE CURRENCY DEPRECIATING I SWIM TO A NUMBER INVESTORS WHO ARE RUNNING THE RULER EVERYTHING'S THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE CERTAINTY OVER A SORT OF WHAT ECONOMIC GROWTH LOOKS LIKE BUT PEOPLE WITH A VERY LONG TERM VIEW ARE THINKING ABOUT BEING OPPORTUNISTIC AND USING THIS WEEK IT'S REMINDED YET AGAIN ISN'T IT THE MARKET'S REALLY DO PRICE POLITICAL RISK THESE MARKETS DO NOT EXIST IN A VACUUM
DEFINITELY NOT AND PART OF THAT IS THE POLICY FRAMEWORK IS IT SO IMPORTANT FOR HOW COMPANIES OPERATE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND THE KNOCK ON IMPACT SUGGESTS THIS COMPANIES DON'T OPERATE IN A VACUUM AND THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGES ACCORDING TO THE BACK
THAT DROP AND THAT'S WHAT WE RESPOND INTO PERNICIOUS TOUCH QUICKLY ON ON ANOTHER BIG PIECE OR MARCUS NEWS YESTERDAY AT BURBERRY THERE PUTTING ONE HUNDRED RETAIL AND LUXURY GIANT CHRISTOPHER BAILEY WAS REPLACED AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE HE TOOK OVER I THINK IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO FROM ANGELA ANTS AND STRAIGHT AWAY THERE WAS SOME CALLS TO SAY LISTEN THIS GUY'S A CREATIVE GENIUS HE SHOULDN'T BE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND THEY'VE FOUND THEIR WAY OUT OF IT
IT WAS A BIT LIKE MAKING YOUR STAR STRIKER OR YOUR MANAGER YOU KNOW HUGELY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESSOR OF BURBERRY BUT BEING A CHIEF EXECUTIVE KEN EVOLVES AND TEDIOUS THINGS LIKE HAVING TO MEET PEOPLE LIKE ME ABOUT ALSO BURBERRY HAD INCREASINGLY ON THE BACK OF ITS SUCCESS ROLLED OUT AND HAD MORE OF A RETAIL FRANCHISE AND THAT OLD FASHIONED SAILING SAME RETAIL IS DETAIL IS SO TRUE SO THEY'VE BOUGHT SOMEBODY INTO A
ALONGSIDE BOTH WILL BE REPORTING HIM TO THE CHAIRMAN BUT HE'S GOT A STRONG RETAIL BACKGROUND AND THEN HE'S GOT A GOOD DAD A GOOD JOB WITH THE LIKES OF CELINE AND YOU THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR THERE'S ACTUALLY GOOD MARKET IF THIS WHAT IF THIS WERE A DIFFERENT COMPANY I THINK PEOPLE BE WOULD BE ALARMED AT THE CHEAP AT TWO MILE AT THE TOP AND THEIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE HAD BEEN SIDELINED
ACTUALLY IT'S A VITAL FOR BABY WILL BE AT THE KEEPER HOLD A BABY AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT SHAREHOLDERS THINK I THING EXACTLY AND THIS IS ABOUT BRINGING A SKILL SET THAT COMPLEMENTS HIS HIS HIS CREATIVE SCRIPTS GIRLS AND HOPEFULLY MAKING FOR A STRONGER COMPANY OVERALL SO THE RULES ARE VERY MUCH AT COMPLY OR EXPLAIN AND I THINK IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU KNOW THE EXPLANATION SEEMS SENSIBLE AND JUST ONE QUICK QUITE AMUSING STORY OVERNIGHT FROM AMERICA
HE'S LESS SHARES THE ELECTRIC CAR COMPANY WERE UP FOUR PER CENT BECAUSE YVONNE MUSK THE BILLIONAIRE WHO WHO RUNS THE COMPANY PUT OUT A TWEET SAYING I'M WORKING ON A TOP SECRET TEARS OF A MASTERPLAN PART HOPING TO PUBLISHED LATER THIS WEEK THIS IS A MODEL FOR U.K. CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS
# I'M NOT QUITE SURE ARE REGULATORS LIKE RELEASES BY TWITTER FEED AND THE LAWYER NEXT AND HE'S LOOKING QUITE HORRIFIED ABOUT THIS AS WELL SO THAT WILL LEAVE THAT ASIDE I THINK WE NEED MORE TOP SECRET MASTER PENCE THANK YOU MUCH JUST GROUND FROM U.K. EXCUSE ME FROM SCHROEDER'S NOWT THIS TIME LAST SUMMER'S FARMERS' LEADERS WERE IN WHITEHALL TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY CALLED A CRISIS IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY THERE IS A MILK GLUT AND SOME FARMERS ARE FEW FARMERS DO LOSE MONEY ON EVERY PINT THEY PRODUCE
TODAY ARE THE BIGGEST DAIRY CO OPERATIVE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IT'S TEAMING UP WITH AS LAUNCHING A NEW FOUR POINT BOTTLE THAT WILL SELL FOR ONE POUND FIFTY OF WHICH TWENTY FIVE P. GOES BACK TO THE CO OPERATIVE PARLOUR NOW WITH ME IS DAVID CHRISTENSEN THE BOARD OF REPRESENTATIVES MEMBER FOODS HE'S BEEN A FARMER BEFORE THE TWENTY YEARS IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS I THINK THEY WERE PRODUCES ABOUT FIVE MILLION LITRES OF MILK A YEAR YES THAT'S IT ABOUT FIVE MILLIMETRES JUST OUTSIDE OXFORD HOW WILL THIS HELP FARMERS HAVING THIS NEW HIGHER PRICE
ANY MONEY THAT COMES BACK INTO THE POT IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR US BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN REALLY TOUGH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS REALLY I'M SUPPLY AND DEMAND HAVE BEEN OUT OF BALANCE NOW ELTON WE CAN'T ALTER THAT SUPPLY AND DEMAND THAT WHAT WE CAN DO IS TRY AND GET MORE FROM THE MARKET TRY AND RECONNECT WITH A CUSTOMER TRINE AND DRIVE INNOVATION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT ONE POINT FIFTY FOR FOUR PINTS I CAN GET TO TESCO AND BY FOUR POINTS FOR A POUND
WHAT WHY WOULD I GO OUT OF MY WAY TO PAY EXTRA FOR IT FIT FOR THE MILK WE DID INITIATIVE LIKE THIS LAST YEAR AND IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL SO WE THEN DID SOME FURTHER RESEARCH ON IT AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS SIXTY PER CENT OF THE CONCEALMENT SAID THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR THEIR DAIRY PRODUCTS IF THEY KNEW THAT THAT EXTRA MONEY WILL GO DIRECTLY BACK TO THE FARMERS AND SOME FURTHER RESEARCH WILL SHOW SAID THAT MANY CONSUMERS ALSO FELT MORE COMFORTABLE BUYING THE DAIRY PRODUCTS FROM A COMPANY THAT THE FARMERS OWNED AS WELL
SO BOTH HAVE THAT'S GIVEN US CONFIDENCE TO HAVE A GO AT THIS JUST BE CLEAR THAT THE MONEY GOES BACK TO THE CO OPERATIVE OR DOESN'T GET DIRECTLY TO THE FARMERS HAVE A CROP OF NEEDS TO MAKE MONEY OF THE LONG TERM BEFORE THE FARMER WILL SEE BENEFIT FROM THIS THAT'S NOT CORRECT YES ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE SUPERMARKETS ABUSING THE POOR FARMER OR IS IT ACTUALLY A MUCH BIGGER PICTURE ABOUT A GLUT IN WORLD NOT PRODUCTION NO IT'S IT'S SUPPLY AND DEMAND OUT OF A LINE AT THE MOMENT THAT'S THE PROBLEM A NUMBER OF FACTORS CHINA AND RUSSIA STOPPED BUYING ALL THE EMBARGO WITH RUSSIA
AT A TIME OF GLOBAL OVERPRODUCTION AS WELL TO THE WHOLE THING GOT COMPLETELY OUT OF THINK EUROPEAN NOT QUOTED SPENDING LAST YEAR A LOT OF MY EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES WHO WERE SHACKLED BY QUOTAS LET THE BRAKES OFF SO SUDDENLY YOU HAVE A LOT OF MILK COMING ONTO A DIFFICULT MARKET TO START WITH AND THAT COMBINATION MEANT THE PRICE JUST TANKED AND THAT'S WHAT'S GIVEN SUCH DIFFICULT TIME ARE SOME FARMERS HAVE RISK OF LOSING THE FARM SOME DAIRY FARMERS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY SOME WILL GO OUT NOW THAT
IT IS IT IS AN ONGOING PROCESS OF COURSE THAT HAPPENS NORMALLY THROUGH THE TURNOVER FARMS BUT MORE WOULD HAVE GONE OUT IN THIS PERIOD THAN THEM BEFORE JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO DIFFICULT HEMISPHERE SOME SIGN OF THERE BEING A BIT OF AN EQUILIBRIUM IN THE MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND COMING A BIT MORE INTO INTO SINK YES WE THINK WE HAVE WITH PROPER THINK WE JUST PASSED THE BOTTOM WENT WE'RE NOT SURE WE NEED A BIT MORE CONFIDENCE BUT THE GLOBAL AUCTION NOW HAS AS MAINTAIN LEVEL FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE WEEK GOT ALL THREE AUCTION SORRY SO WE THINK WE'RE JUST ABOUT THERE BUT WE NEED A BIT MORE CONFIDENCE AND JUST HAVE A SLIGHTLY BROADER POINT
BRITAIN HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT WOULD A NAME TO THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY MEAN FOR FOR YOU AS A FARMER I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE SAME ANSWER FROM ASIA GET FROM MOST OF THE BUSINESS COMMENTATORS IT'S A SEA OF UNCERTAINTY OUT THERE WE JUST DON'T KNOW AT THE MOMENT IT WILL DEPEND UPON WHAT ATTITUDE U.K. GOVERNMENT TAKES TOWARDS A CULTURE SECTOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH DAVID CHRISTENSEN FROM OTHER FOODS

# A UNITED NATIONS TRIBUNAL IS SAID TO GIVE HER LONG AWAITED RULING ON CHINA'S CONTROVERSIAL TERRITORIAL CLAIMS OVER ALMOST ALL THE SOUTH CHINA SEA THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN CEMENTING THEIR CLAIM TO THE WATERS BY TURNING REEFS INTO ARTIFICIAL ISLANDS CAPABLE OF BEING USED AS MILITARY BASES BEIJING HE SAID IT WON'T BE BOUND BY THE RULING
# PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL SPEAK AT A MEMORIAL SERVICE IN DALLAS LATER FOR THE FIVE POLICE OFFICERS KILLED BY A SNIPER LAST THURSDAY PROTESTS HAVE CONTINUED AND THE NUMBER OF U.S. CITIES OVER THE POLICE SHOOTINGS LAST WEEK OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN LOUISIANA AND MINNESOTA
# AN EXPERT REVIEW HAS FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT TAKING MULTI VITAMIN TABLETS DURING PREGNANCY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF MOTHERS OR THEIR BABIES AND SAYS THEY ARE AN UNNECESSARY EXPENSE THE REVIEW PUBLISHED IN THE DRUG AND THERAPEUTICS BULLETIN SAYS HIGH DOSES OF VITAMIN A. CAN EVEN HARM A DEVELOPING FOETUS BUT IT DOES SAY WOMEN SHOULD TAKE FOLIC ACID AND VITAMIN D. MANUFACTURERS SAY THE STUDY DOESN'T TAKE ACCOUNT OF U.K. DIETS
# ARCHAEOLOGIST FROM OXFORD UNIVERSITY I FOUND EVIDENCE OF ANCIENT STONE TOOLS USED BY MONKEYS IN BRAZIL THE RESEARCHERS UNEARTHED STONES THAT THE ANIMALS USED TO CRACK OPEN NUTS WHICH ARE SAID TO BE AT LEAST SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS OLD THE DISCOVERY IS THE LATEST EVIDENCE OF NON HUMAN TOOL USE IN NUMEROUS SPECIES FROM APES TO CROWS
# THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN THE COUNTRY HAS A NEW PRIME MINISTER TOMORROW AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW AND THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF THING FOR MISSUS MADE TO DO IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR GETTING A CABINET TOGETHER FOR A START NORM WELL THAT WILL BE THE FIRST CHALLENGE THE PACE OF EVENTS HAS CRANKED UP THE PRESSURE ON MISSUS GO MISSUS MAY APOLOGIES VERY FREUDIAN INDEED TO MOVE VERY VERY QUICKLY INDEED
AND IT WILL INCENSE I THINK GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO THE SORT OF GOVERNMENT MISSUS MAY IS GOING TO LEAD WHETHER IT IS GOING TO BE A MOMENT OF CHANGE IN OUR POLITICS OR A MOMENT OF CONTINUITY BECAUSE THIS IS HER MOMENT OF MAXIMUM POWER WHEN SHE COMES IN AND SHE HAS A CLEAN SLATE SHE CAN DO WHAT SHE WILL
IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT SHE WAS SAYING IN HER SPEECH YESTERDAY SHE CLEARLY SIGNALLED SHE WANTED HER PREMIERSHIP TO BE DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF MY CAMERON AND MISTER OSBORNE FLAGGING UP AREAS OF REFORM IN TERMS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY WHICH WOULD SIGNAL A BREAK WITH THE PAST
AND EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT MISSUS MAY IS SHE'S NOT GIVEN TO GRAND THEATRICAL GESTURES AND SHE SEEMS TO PRIZE ABOVE ALL LOYALTY AND COMPETENT SO I SUSPECT THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONTINUITY IN THEIR NEW GOVERNMENT A LOT OF SPECULATION OBVIOUSLY ON THE POSITION OF THE CHANCELLOR
MANY PEOPLE SUGGESTING HE WILL BE MOVED BUT MAYBE TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE SO RETAINING A SIGNIFICANT POST ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FATE OF THE BIG BEASTS OF BRECHT SAID BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO THEIR POSITION I WOULD THINK MUCH MORE VULNERABLE IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR CONDUCT DURING THE LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN THERE MISSUS MAY COULD WANT TO KEEP MICHAEL GO TO FINISH PRESENT REFORMS LASTLY THERE'S THE ISSUE OF WHO WILL BECOME THE BRECK SIT MINISTER THAT SHE HAS PROMISED NOW THE LIKELY
FIGURES THERE COULD BE CHRIS GRAYLING HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER PROMINENT BREAKS SETTEE ALL LIAM FOX WHO INTRODUCED AT A SPEECH YESTERDAY ALL RIGHT IVY EVEN DAVID DAVIS ACTOR YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME IS GOING TO BE CHARLES HAVE YOU GOT TEN SECONDS TO DO IT IN WELL THE SPECULATION IS IT WILL BE PHILIP HAMMOND BECAUSE HE'S A FORMER CHIEF SECRETARY HE'S THE MAN WHO WAS THOUGHT TO GET THE DEFENCE BUDGET UNDER CONTROL LIKE MISSUS MEYER SEEMS A SAFE PAIR OF HANDS SO HE WOULD SEEM TO BE
# THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATE RIGHT WE'LL HOLD YOU TO THAT THANKS NORMAN THERE ARE OTHER THINGS HAPPENING IN POLITICS AS WELL AT TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THEN WILLIE HE'LL WON'T TO BE ABLE TO RUN EVEN AS THE TORIES DISPLAYED CHARACTERISTIC RUTHLESSNESS AND ENDED THEIR LEADERSHIP CONTEST LABOUR ARE STILL ARGUING ABOUT WHETHER JEREMY CORBIN CAN RUN IN MARES ARE POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON AND SEEN A RATHER INTERESTING LETTER TELL US MORE
VERY INTERESTING DEEDS ARGUMENTS I THINK IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT AT THIS TIME THE LABOUR ANY SEES MEETING AT TWO O'CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE RENT OF THE QUESTION AS YOU SEE IS WHETHER JEREMY WILL HAVE TO SEEK THE NOMINATIONS FROM FIFTY OF HIS FELLOW M.P.S NODDED TO GET ON THE BALLOT AND EFFECTIVELY DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST ANGELA EAGLE'S CHALLENGE HIS OPPONENTS WANT TO KEEP HIM OFF BECAUSE THEY THINK YOU CAN'T BE THAT
THRESHOLD OF THEIR PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUES BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN TODAY IS A LETTER FROM HIS SOLICITORS WHICH USED TO SPECIALISE ACTUALLY AND BOTH HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION UNDID PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS THE LESS AND THEY HAVE BEEN ENGAGED BY JIM KENNEDY WHO'S OUR TRADE UNION MEMBER OF LABOUR'S EDDIE SEE AND THEY'VE WRITTEN TO THE PARTY'S GENERAL SECRETARY
NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT UNLESS JEREMY CORBIN IS ON THE BAR THAT THEY WILL SUIT WHAT THEY CALL AN INJUNCTION JUMPED OF REMEDY ANOTHER WANTS TO GO TO THE HIGH COURT AND TRY TO STOP THE LEADERSHIP ELECTION TAKING PLACE LES IS PUT ON THAT BALLOT THEY'RE ALSO QUARTERING TWO BITS OF THE ADVICE THAT THEY HAVE SEEN ONE ACTUALLY COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITE UNION MAKE A ONCE THROUGH Q.C. ANOTHER BY DENTISTRY CHAMBERS WHICH THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP HAVE SEEN THEY SAY THAT THE RULES SAY HE SHOULD UNEQUIVOCALLY BEYOND THE BALLOT AND
CHALLENGING THE PARTY'S GENERAL SECRETARY TO PUBLISH HIS LEGAL ADVICE IF HE'S GOT ANY ADVICE TO THE CONTRARY YOU SHOULD PUBLISH IT IF THEY SHOULD GIVE IT TO ME IT WAS LABOUR'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE BEFORE THIS AFTERNOON I MEAN THAT'S NOT CRUCIAL THINGS TODAY ISN'T IT THAT IAN MCNICHOL A GENERAL SECRETARY IS SAID TO HAVE HIS OWN LEGAL ADVICE THAT SAYS CORBIN DOES NEED FIFTY DAMES OF LABOUR M.P.S BACK HIM IF HE'S EVER TO RUN
THAT'S RIGHT AND EFFECTIVELY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT THAT LEGAL ADVICE PUBLISH IT BUT ALSO SUGGESTED ME MIGHT HAVE LEGAL ADVICE THAT SAYS THE OPPOSITE THAT SAYS IT SHOULD IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE ON A BAL AUTOMATICALLY AND THEY'RE SEEING IF IT DOESN'T PUBLISH THAT WILL PUSH SUE HIM FOR LEGAL COSTS AS A PRETTY HEAVY HANDED LES ANYTHING I'M SURE PEOPLE THAT A RECORD WOULD SEE AS A QUITE THREATENING LETTER ACTUALLY NOT THE SORT OF THING
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE ARRIVING IN THE POST FROM YOUR LAWYERS SO EFFECTIVELY THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHAT THE SAME BUT ALSO COMPLAINING THAT THE MEETING THIS AFTERNOON HAS BEEN HELD AT ONLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS NOTICE SO IN OTHER WORDS A SUGGESTION OR PERHAPS THAT'S NOT ENOUGH NOTICE FOR SOME PEOPLE SUPPORT JEREMY CARBON TO GET THERE
UNDERLYING THREAT IF YOU LIKE THOUGH RIGHT EVEN CHALLENGE AT THIS AFTERNOON'S MEETING ANY DECISION IT REACHES IT WASN'T THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL BE TALKING TO ANGELA EAGLE AND TO LEN MCCLUSKEY AT THE UNITE UNION LATER THE BREAK TWENTY TWO MINUTES SEVEN KNOW WHO OWNS THE SOUTH CHINA SEA THAT IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING AS WHAT A COURT HAS BEEN TRYING TO DECIDE FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS IT'S GETTING NEAR TO REACHING A DECISION ROBIN BRAND HE'S A CHINA CORRESPONDENT BUT A BACKGROUND ROBIN
# WELL THIS GOES BACK TWO THOUSAND YEARS JOHN HOW'S THAT FOR THAT CHINA BILLY CLONES OVER VAST SWATHES OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA GOING BACK THAT LONG IT POINTS TO A MAP SHOWING WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE NINE DASH LINE FROM NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN AND THAT IS ITS HISTORICAL BASE REALLY TO ITS CLAIM OVER THIS VAST SWATHES OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA OR BECOME A U. SHAPED NINE DASH LINE THE BRUSHES ALONGSIDE THE COASTLINE OF
MALAYSIA VIETNAM OF TAIWAN AND CRUCIALLY THE PHILIPPINES AND IS THE PHILIPPINES GOVERNMENT THAT HAS BROUGHT THIS CASE CHINA FROM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ONWARDS IT WANTS A RULING ON THE LEGALITY OF THAT NINE DASH LINE AND ALSO THE STATUS OF SOME OF THESE ISLANDS OR OTHER TERRITORIES WITHIN THE SEE IF CHINA DOESN'T GET WHAT IT WANTED THE PHILIPPINES DON'T GET WHAT THEY WANT OTHER DANGERS IN THIS
YES THERE ARE I MEAN THERE HAVE BEEN MILITARY CONFLICTS IN THE PAST NINETEEN SEVENTIES NINETEEN EIGHTIES WITH VIETNAM PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND CHINA IS A COUNTRY WITH THE PRESIDENT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS ASSERTING HIS CONTROL OVER THIS COUNTRY'S MILITARY AND ASSERTING CHINA'S INFLUENCE WITHIN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND BEYOND WE'VE SEEN HUGE PROPAGANDA EFFORTS HERE IN CHINA LEADING UP TO THIS RULING CHINA DOESN'T WANT TO MILITARY CONFRONTATION ISN'T THE REALITY IS
NO ONE WANTS A MILITARY CONFRONTATION BUT WHAT THIS PITTS IS NOT REALLY CHINA AGAINST THE PHILIPPINES BUT CHINA AGAINST THE UNITED STATES THEY STAND BEHIND THE PHILIPPINES THEY ARE CONCERNED PRESIDENT OBAMA NO DOUBT HIS SUCCESSOR IS CONCERNED ABOUT CHINA'S INCREASED ASSERTION OF ITS INFLUENCE IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
AND THEY WANT TO COUNTER THAT OF COURSE AND THIS RULING TODAY WILL BE CRUCIAL BECAUSE IF HE GOES AGAINST CHINA AS MANY EXPECT THAT COULD HERALD SOME KIND OF A RETREAT MAYBE IN TERMS OF ITS PRESENCE ON THOSE ISLANDS ISLANDS IT HAS CONSTRUCTED HAS BUILT UP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS INTO EFFECTIVELY MILITARY BASES AND JUST A QUICK THOUGHT DOES CHINA WANT TO TROUBLE YOU SAY IT'S NOT LOOKING FOR TROUBLE BUT IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN WOULD IT THEN RESPOND
YES IT WILL RESPOND WHEN I SAY TELL HE'S NOT WE CAN PATROL I DON'T THINK I WAS GOING FOR MILITARY CONFLICT BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE INTENTION OF PRESIDENT SHE PING AND THE BEIJING GOVERNMENT IS TO INCREASE ITS INFLUENCE IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND BEYOND THAT IT'S CHANGED ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME OF SMALLER NEIGHBOURS WHO HISTORICALLY IT WAS SEEN AS BEING MUCH MORE
SYMPATHETIC TO IT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW IF THIS RULING GOES AGAINST THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HOW THEY CAN RETREAT HOW THEY CAN BACK DOWN HAVING HAD ALL THIS CONSTRUCTION AND HE IS A MAN PRESIDENT SHEETING THING WAS INCREASINGLY ASSERTED HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE CHINESE MILITARY AS WELL AND THEY WON'T WANT A HUMILIATING RETREAT THANKS ROBIN
# NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS MAKES THE FRONT PAGES PICTURE THERESA MAY CELEBRATING THE MALE HAS A CLOSE UP OF HER BEING KISSED BY HER HUSBAND PHILIP CORONATION OF TERESA IT SAYS IN THE GUARDIAN SHE SEEN WALKING PAST APPLAUDING IN CHEERING CONSERVATIVE M.P.S THE SON HAS A LARGE PICTURE OF HER LEOPARD PRINT SHOES WITH AN INSET PHOTO OF HER LAUGHING HE'LL BOYS SAYS THE HEADLINE
NEW P.M. CAN REUNITE THE TORIES AND DELIVER BRECK'S HOWEVER THE MIRROR IS IN THE MOOD FOR CONFRONTATION PICTURED CENTRE CHIN UP NOSTRILS PROMINENT NECK VEINS BULGING AN EARLY ELECTION BRING IT ON THE MIRRORS HERE POINTS EITHER BRITAIN'S NEW PRIME MINISTERS HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BY ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE TORY M.P.S
NOUGHT POINT NOUGHT NOUGHT NOUGHT FOUR PER CENT OF THE ELECTORATE THINK YOU'VE GOT ALL THOSE NOTES RIGHT HAMMER FERN IN THE EYE HE SAYS MISSUS MAY MIKE HAVE RULED OUT HOLDING A GENERAL ELECTION UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY BUT THAT WAS BEFORE SHE KNEW SHE'D BE HANDED THE PRIME MINISTER SHIP ON A PLATE NOW SHE MUST BITE THE BALLOT TO GET THE MANDATORY GRADES AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING SPECULATION IS ALREADY RIFE ABOUT WHO WILL BE WHO HE MISSUS MAY'S FIRST CABINET ACCORDING TO THE TIMES BORIS JOHNSON IS SAID BY FRIENDS TO EXPECT LITTLE MICHAEL GAVE WITH HIM SHE'S FREQUENTLY CLASH
MUST FEAR FOR HIS FUTURE NOT SO SAYS THE SUN'S TREVOR KAVANAGH MISSUS MAY HE SAYS MUST SWALLOW HARD AND GIVE THE JOB OF CHANCELLOR OR FOREIGN SECRETARY TO A LEADING BRICKS A TEAR AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PROVEN HEAVYWEIGHT CANDIDATE TO TAKE ON THE BRUSSELS BLOB MICHAEL GO VEE SAYS MOST OF THE PAPERS FANCY A PROMOTION FOR THE FORMER DISPENSE SECRETARY LIAM FOX A MALE SAYS HE'S A LONGSTANDING DINNER COMPANION OF THE NEW P.M. AND COULD BE MADE CABINET MINISTER
FOR BRICKS BEYOND THEIR PERSONALITIES ONE OF MISSUS MAY'S BIRMINGHAM SPEECH YESTERDAY MADE BEFORE ANDREA LEAD SOME DROPPED OUT OF THE LEADERSHIP RACE EXTRAORDINARY SAYS NORTH PRACTICALLY IN THE GUARDIAN SHE NOT ONLY ATTACKED THE GROTESQUE LEVELS OF EXECUTIVE PAY BUT MADE AN UNEQUIVOCAL PLEDGE TO GIVE EMPLOYEES REPRESENTATION ON COMPANY BOARDS THE F. T. SAYS IT WAS NOT THE MESSAGE BIG BUSINESS WANTED TO HERE ON THE OTHER HAND A FINANCIAL MARKETS RAVENOUS FOR ANY MORSEL OF CERTAINTY PICKED UP
# WHEN SHE BECAME THE LAST WOMAN STANDING THERE CERTAIN SAYS HER VICTORY TRIGGERED AN AMAZING RALLY TAKEN THE STOCK MARKET TO AN ELEVEN MONTH HIGH THE EXPRESS GOES PAST ASSAYED DIRECTED EXIT BRITAIN IS BOOMING COMPARATIVELY SCANT ATTENTION IS PAID TO LABOUR TO ANGELA EAGLE'S LEADERSHIP BID THE MALE DOESN'T GET INTO IT UNTIL PAGE THIRTY SIX THE TIME SAYS ON ANY NORMAL DAY SHE WOULD HAVE LED THE NEWS BUT IN THE EVENT A CAMPAIGN LAUNCH WAS IT SAYS AN EMBARRASSING SIDE SHOW
THE EYE SAYS THAT THREE QUARTERS OF THE MEDIA WHO WERE THERE SNEAKED OUT AS THE LAUNCH CAME AT THE EXACT MOMENT WHEN ANDREA LET'S QUIT THE MIRROR LIKED IT THOUGH MISTER EAGLE THAT PAPER SAYS PUT IN AN IMPRESSIVE GUTSY SHOWING POLLY TOYNBEE IN THE GUARDIAN USES METAPHOR TO SUM UP LABOUR'S POSITION THE PARTY IS IN FREEFALL SHE SAYS BUT ALSO ON A BIZARRE CEASE OR AS ITS MEMBERSHIP RISES SO IT SUPPORT IN THE COUNTRY FALLS
# IT IS QUARTER TO SEVEN ON THE MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS OF COURSE THAT DAVID CAMERON WILL CHAIR HIS FINAL CABINET MEETING TODAY AS THERESA MAY TRIES TO RESTORE CONSERVATIVE UNITY BY FORMING A NEW TEAM THAT BALANCES THE OPPOSING SIDES FROM THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN ON EX PRIME MINISTER'S PROMISED TO MAKE BRECK'S IT A SUCCESS EVEN THOUGH SHE CAMPAIGNED FOR BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. BUT WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FINAL SAY OVER HOW AND WHEN
THE U.K. DOES LEAVE A THOUSAND BARRISTERS HAVE SIGNED A LETTER TO DAVID CAMERON CALLING FOR M.P.S TO BE GIVEN THE LAST WORD IN A FREE VOTE BUT GOVERNMENT LAWYERS THINK THE PROCESS OF LEAVING THE E.U. DOESN'T NEED THEIR APPROVAL ALL CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN NOW REPORTS ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT
IT'S THE QUESTION EVERYONE'S BEEN ASKING WHEN WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNMENT THAT WAS THE LABOUR M.P. HELEN GOODMAN IT'S BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY FEW WEEKS BUT PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN THE BACKDROP TO THE NON STOP POLITICKING RATHER THAN A LEADING PLAYER
HELEN GOODMAN WAS WORRIED THAT THE COMMONS WOULDN'T GET A SAY IN THE DECISION TO TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY THE FORMAL PROCESS FOR ENDING THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HERE SHE'S AT STAKE OUT THE CULMINATION OF FORTY YEARS OF LEGISLATION ISN'T IT EXTRA READ TO SUGGEST THE CHANGES TO BE SHOULD NOT NOW COME BACK TO THIS
PRIORITIES AND TRADE OFFS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO EVERYONE LIVING IN THE U.K.
SURELY HE IS NOT SUGGESTING THEY SHOULD BE DECIDED IN WHITEHALL BEHIND CLOSED DOOR WHILE PARLIAMENT IS PRESENTED WITH
A CABINET OFFICE MINISTER JOHN PENROSE SAID GOVERNMENT LAWYERS BELIEVED THE PRIME MINISTER DIDN'T NEED TOGET PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL BEFORE TRIGGERING ARTICLE FIFTY BUT HE ADDED THAT HE WAS SURE EVERYONE AGREED THAT DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES SHOULD OUTRANK LEGAL FORMALITIES MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND FOR MAIDENHEAD WHO LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO HIS NEW PRIME MINISTER
THAT'S THERESA MAY BY THIS POINT ON MONDAY AFTERNOON M.P.S KNEW THAT MISSUS MAY WOULD BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHEN HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR IN SAYING THAT BRICKS IT MEANS BRECHT'S
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE DESTINATION TO WHICH WE ARE TRAVELLING IS NOT IN DOUBT THE MEANS AND HOW WE GET THERE WE'LL HAVE TO BE EXPLAINED
I THINK IT IS ONLY FAIR TO WAIT UNTIL SHE IS PRIME MINISTER AND SHE HAS A CHANCE TO LAY OUT A PROGRAMME SHE HAS A CHANCE TO LAY OUT THE PROCESS AND THEREFORE WHEN PARLIAMENT WILL BE HAVE A CHANCE TO DISCUSS AND DEBATE THESE ISSUES AND AT THAT POINT I'M SURE ALL WILL BE REVEALED
A CONSERVATIVE FORMER CABINET MINISTER JOHN REDWOOD HAD HIS OWN SUGGESTION FOR THE BEST WAY TO AS HE PUT IT TAKE BACK CONTROL AND SEEK PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL PROCEED QUICKLY TO REPEAL THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
WHILST TRANSFERRING ALL EUROPEAN MORE RELEVANT TO THE SINGLE MARKET
INTO BRITISH FLOOR BUT AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING OUR BORDERS AND KEEPING OUR CONTRIBUTIONS THAT'S WHAT WE VOTED FOR A NEW GOVERNMENT DELIVER THAT PROBABLY LABOUR'S SHADOW CABINET OFFICE MINISTER LOUIS' HAIG SUGGESTED THE NEW PRIME MINISTER SHOULD TAKE A CONSIDERED VIEW ON THE FUTURE OF NEGOTIATIONS
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY INDICATED IT WILL CONSULT THE DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATION AND THE MAYOR OF LONDON AND IT MUST DO THE SAME WITH HER MAJESTY'S OFFICIAL OPPOSITION THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DEVELOP A CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT THE COUNTRIES NEGOTIATING PLAN SHOULD BE AND THAT SHOULD BE PUT TO A VOTE IN THIS HOUSE THE S.N.P. PETE WISHART PICKED UP ON THAT POINT ABOUT CONSULTING THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT
THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL CONFIRM THAT BEFORE ANY PROCESSOR SPARTAN ARTICLE FIFTY EVER SCOTTISH A FOOL WE CONSULTED AND THE APOSTLE SAINT FOR ANY SORT OF MOVE FORWARD
IT'S ALSO REMAINED IN THE MINISTER AND SCOTLAND DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE STORY INSPIRED AND IT'S A SCOTTISH PEOPLE FROM FREE FOR US I'LL SORT THEM
WE'VE YET TO ANY OF US HER SEE THAT WE RESPECT THE SCOTTISH RESULT AND JUST HERE TO MAKE SURE THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE ALSO TO QUEUE WHAT THE IMPORTANT
THE MINISTER JOHN PENROSE TOLD MISTER WISHART A COMMITMENT TO CONSULT WASN'T THE SAME THING A SEEKING OUTRIGHT CONSENT OR CONSERVATIVE LEAVE CAMPAIGNER DOCTOR LIAM FOX SO THE REFERENDUM WASN'T A CONSULTATION IT WAS AN INSTRUCTION FROM THE BRITISH PEOPLE THE PRIME MINISTER ORIGINALLY SAID THAT HE WOULD TRIGGER
ARTICLE FIFTY IMMEDIATELY SO PRESUMABLY FELT HE HAD THE FULL LEGAL AUTHORITY TO DO SO
THERE'S MY UNCLE FRED EXCEPT THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO HAVE A VOTE BEFORE ASKING FIFTY IS TRIGGERED I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY
IT'S A CLEAR ATTEMPT TO QUARTER THE DEMOCRATIC WILL
BUT A LABOUR FORMER CABINET MINISTER BEN BRADSHAW ARGUED THAT REFERENDUMS WERE ADVISORY AND PARLIAMENT WAS SOVEREIGN ISN'T IT THEY CONSTITUTIONAL
RAGE AND A SUPREME IRONY THAT THOSE PEOPLE OVER THERE WHO BASE THEIR ARGUMENT FOR BREAKFAST ON PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY NOW WANT TO DENY THIS HOUSE EVER
AND SUGGEST SUGGESTED AN UNELECTED PRIME MINISTER UNELECTED WITH NO MANDATE AGREES TO SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL DECISION FOR THIS COUNTRY IT'S A DISGRACE AND THEY MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH IT
JOHN PENROSE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY BRADSHAW WAS AN EXPERIENCED POLITICIAN HE MAY BE RIGHT ON STRICT CONSTITUTIONAL LEGALITIES BUT I'M AFRAID THAT DIMMOCK DEMOCRATICALLY HERE'S FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG ANDY SAID IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR M.P.S TO THUMBED THEIR NOSES AT THE BRITISH PEOPLE
THAT WAS SEAN CURRAN REPORTING AND OF COURSE YOU CAN HEAR MORE ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AT HOP ESTATE ON LONG WAVE OR ON DIGITAL
# IN APRIL A WOMAN WITH DUAL BRITISH IRANIAN NATIONALITY TOOK A TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TO IRAN FOR A HOLIDAY WITH HER PARENTS AS THEY WERE LEAVING AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS ARRESTED BY REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS AND SHE IS STILL BEING HELD WILL RICHARD LUCK WRAPPED IT IS HER HUSBAND MEZZANINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JOHN WHAT HAPPENED HOOPS AT THE AIRPORT WAS IT YES HE'S AT THE AIRPORT AND AS SHE WAS
TAKING HIM TO GO HOME SHE WAS PICKED UP BY THE GARDEN INITIALLY SHE WAS TOLD THERE WAS A POSSIBLE PROBLEM AND THEN SHE WAS WAS TAKEN OFF FOR QUESTIONING SHE WAS THERE WHICH WAS GABRIELLA OUR DAUGHTER WHO WAS GIVEN BACK TO HER HER PARENTS AND SAID THIS'LL TAKE A FEW HOURS AND THEN SHE JUST DISAPPEARED SO I'M KNOCK O.K. IS SHE WITH HER DAUGHTER STILL WITH YOU AT ALL NO NO GABRIELLA'S CURRENTLY WITH HER GRANDPA WITH HER GRANDPA BUT HER PASSPORT'S BEEN TANIA AND HER BRITISH PASSPORT HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE RELISH WE CAN'T SO SHE CAN'T TRAVEL OVER AND HAVE THEY GIVEN NO REASON
NO SO YESTERDAY IN FACT IN THE COURT IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE NEWSPAPERS IT WAS ANNOUNCED TO HER CASE HAD GONE TO COURT WHEN THERE WERE CHARGES WHAT CASE WHAT CHILDREN ARE BUT THERE WERE NO CHARGES GIVEN SO WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT
WHAT SHE'S BEEN HELPFUL AND THEN THEY'VE BEEN STUFF IN THE NEWSPAPER IN NOTHING IN THESE PAPERS IN VARIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE RADIO IRANIAN PRESS SAYING THAT SHE WAS INVOLVED IN THE SOFT OVERTHROW OF THE REGIME IMPLYING THAT SHE'S THERE ON SOME SORT OF MISSION WITH HER DAUGHTER
OVERTHROW BUT IT WAS JUST CRAZY BECAUSE SHE'S NOT BEEN POLITICALLY ALL TASHA YOU'RE ACTUALLY NO NO SO SHE'S A CHARITY WORKER SHE WAS THERE ON HOLIDAY SHE WAS THERE ON HOLIDAY FULL TIME TO THE BABY BEING THERE A NUMBER OF TIMES JUST FOR A FAMILY VISIT WHAT'S THE FOREIGN OFFICE A FOREIGN OFFICE DOING ABOUT IT
WELL THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN MAKING REPRESENTATIONS TEARS HE RAIN IN GOVERNMENT ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS AND ONE OF THE STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED THREE WEEKS AGO WAS THAT
HER FAMILY WERE GIVEN A MESSAGE TO GIVE TO ME TO GIVE TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE WHICH WAS TO SAY WE WILL RELEASE HER AND THEN WE WILL CLOSE THE CASE IF YOU COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON AGREEMENT ON OR THEY DIDN'T SPECIFY THEY SAID THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WOULD KNOW THE AGREEMENT
BIZARRE SO IT'S A REALLY STRANGE WAY OF CONDUCTING ONE INDEED ON WHEN YOU SAID AS I'M SURE YOU HAD TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT WHAT DO THEY SAY TO YOU THEY ARE SO I REPORTED IT OBVIOUSLY AS I'VE HEARD IT AND THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND I'M SURE THAT WILL BE TRUE FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM AND THAT THEY WOULD CHECK WITH THE EMBASSY BUT WHAT IS IT DO YOU HAVE ANY SUSPICIONS AS TO WHAT MAY BE GOING ON HERE NO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THE NUMBER OF
BRITISH OR AMERICAN OR CANADIAN IRANIANS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN RECENT MONTHS SINCE THE PARROT PUNCH ELECTION TO RUN THAT ARE BEING HELD FOR DIFFERENT REASONS AND IT IT FEELS LIKE IT'S PARTLY DOMESTIC POLITICS AND THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD TRYING TO ASSERT THEIR POWER AGAINST ANOTHER PARTS OF INTERNATIONAL SO YOU'RE WISE WIFE AND OTHERS ARE JUST PAWNS IN THIS IT THAT'S SO THAT'S MY VIEW IS THAT YES MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTER ARE BEING HELD US IN THIS POLITICAL PAWNS IN A POLITICAL GAME COURAGEOUS ISN'T IT IT'S JUST MENTAL
IT WAS JUST CRAZY I MEAN IF YOU HAD ANY CONTACT WITH HER SO FOR A LONG TIME NOT FOR A LONG TIME SHE WAS KEPT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT WASN'T ABLE TO CALL AND WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT SHE WASN'T ABLE TO WALK
WITHOUT OATS AND THAT SHE WAS JUST BEFORE JUST BEFORE THE FEAST THE EAD AND SHE WAS ALLOWED TO CALL ME FOR HER FOR A FEW MINUTES AND SO WE WERE THEN QUITE HOPEFUL THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE RELEASED BECAUSE IRAN DOES RELEASE PEOPLE AT THAT RELIGIOUS FEAST AND THEN I SAY YESTERDAY SHE WAS WAS TAKEN TO COURT
WELL KEEP IN TOUCH OF COURSE AND WE WISH YOU WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN SHE MAY HAVE BEEN AT THE TOP OF THE CABINET FOR MANY YEARS BUT REMARKABLY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER WILL ACTUALLY APPROACH THE JOB THOSE YOU'VE DEALT WITH THE HOME SECRETARY HAVE HAD JUST A GLIMPSE OF HOW SHE APPROACHES DECISIONS AMONGST THEM ALASTAIR MORGAN WHO SUCCESSFULLY LOBBIED THERESA MAY TO SET UP AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY TO EXAMINE THE POLICE'S HANDLING OF THE UNSOLVED MURDER OF HIS BROTHER THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR DANIEL MOORE MORNING TO YOU MY GOOD MORNING
YOU MUSTN'T HAVE HAD VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF TREASON BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU'RE ASKING CONSERVATIVE HOME SECRETARY WEREN'T YOU TO CONFRONT THE POLICE IN A WAY MANY OF HER LABOUR PREDECESSORS HAD REFUSED TO DO YES WE'D HAD PRETTY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT
WITH WHOM THEY'D EAT THEY'D REFUSED TO MEET US AT ANY POINT AND SO WE WENT INTO THE MEETING WITH HER OUR FIRST MEETING WITH HER WITH VERY LOW EXPECTATIONS
AND WERE THEY FULFILLED THEM IN AND PEOPLE OFTEN DESCRIBE HER AS I SEE IS THAT DIFFICULT WOMAN AS KEN CLARKE CALLED WOULD SHE INITIALLY SHE WAS COOL QUITE RESERVED WITH US WE WERE IT WAS QUITE A CONFRONTATIONAL MEETING BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN IGNORED FOR SO LONG THAT WE WERE VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE HOME OFFICE AND
AS I SAID IT WAS CONFRONTATIONAL BUT
WELL AFTER THAT WHEN WE HAD A SECOND MEETING SHE SHE HAD OBVIOUSLY DONE HER HOMEWORK ON THE CASE AND WAS VERY RECEPTIVE TO WHAT WE WERE SAYING SHE ASKED
INTELLIGENT PERCEPTIVE QUESTIONS AND THEN IT WENT ON TO HER PROPOSING
A PANEL OF ENQUIRY SO YOU HAD A SENSE THAT BETWEEN YOUR FIRST AND SECOND MEETING SHE'D GONE AWAY AND CHANGED HER MIND THAT SHE LISTEN TO WHAT YOU'D SET WELL INITIALLY SHE'D SAID THAT THE POLICE SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE CORRUPTION THAT THE MET HAD ALREADY ADMITTED AND WE WERE VERY VERY
AGAINST THAT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE POLICE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE AT ALL IN THEM AND SO WE PROTESTED AT THIS AND I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT TAKEN ABACK BUT
IN BETWEEN MEETING SHE'D OBVIOUSLY SHE'S OBVIOUSLY DONE HER HOMEWORK AND FROM THEN ON FROM THEN ON IN IT WAS A MUCH MORE
TOO MUCH MORE OF A TWO WAY DIALOGUE AND HOW BIG A DECISION WAS IT FOR HER TO TAKE IT WE KNOW THAT SHE CONFRONTED THE POLICE EVER HILLSBOROUGH SHE KNOWS WHICH HE DID OVER THE ISSUE OF PAIN ALSO THE WAY IN WHICH THE POLICE FEDERATION WAS ORGANISED AND OPERATED FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE CASE DID THIS WOULD REQUIRE A DEGREE OF BRAVERY TO DO THIS OH ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND NOT ONLY THAT THERE WAS ALSO A MEDIA ASPECT OF THE CASE WHICH WAS WHICH AGAIN IS IT TASTE BRAVERY TO CONFRONT
THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS OF INTERFERENCE BY A MAJOR NEWSPAPER IN ONE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS SO IT WAS IT WAS A SERIOUS MAN BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOUR POLITICS ARE DO YOU FIND YOURSELF AS A REAL THINKING
PHEW I FEEL RELIEVED THAT SHE'S TAKING OVER HER OTHER ALL SORTS OF OTHER REASONS THAT YOU DON'T LIKE THE IDEA NO I'M
I WAS OF THE CANDIDATES ON ON DISPLAY SO TO SPEAK SHE WAS DEFINITELY THE ONE I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN AMONGST THE CONSERVATIVES ALISTAIR MORGAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US

# THANK YOU IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WANTED A NEW CLICHE TO CAPTURE THE DIZZYING THE DISORIENTATING THE DAZZLING UNPREDICTABILITY OF POLITICS A DAY NEVER MIND A WEEK TURNS OUT TO BE AN ABSOLUTE ETERNITY THIS TIME YESTERDAY MORNING DAVID CAMERON KNEW OR FORTY DO THAT HE HAD ANOTHER NINE WEEKS AS A PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY KNEW OR THOUGHT SHE KNEW THAT SHE FACED A LONG HOT SUMMER'S CAMPAIGN FOR HIS JOB
BUT BY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON ALL THAT HAD CHANGED THOSE OF US IN WESTMINSTER WITNESSED THE FACT THE POWER WAS ON THE MOVE
INSIDE THIS IN STEPHEN'S ENTRANCE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS JUST BEFORE FIVE P.M.
A GATHERING OF THE FACES OF THE NEW TORY LEADERSHIP THERESA MAY WILL COME HERE IN JUST A FEW MINUTES TO APPEAR BEFORE THE CAMERAS TO MAKE HER FIRST STATEMENT AS THE NATION'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER
IT'S GREAT I THINK THE BEST CANDIDATE WAS THE ONLY CANDIDATE STANDING SHE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT PRIME MINISTER AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT WHEN YOU WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND DID ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA YOU'D BE STANDING HERE NOW ABOUT TO EMERGE WITH THE NEXT ONE MYSTERY TO BE
YEAH NO THAT'S FIONA'S AN INKLING AN INKLING THAT OVERTIME SHE MIGHT DROP OUT BUT WE DIDN'T EXPECT A SECRET YOU'RE HEADING OUTSIDE FOR THE PHOTO OPPORTUNITY SO HERE YOU ARE LOOK WE'RE WALKING TOGETHER I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M GAY CRASHING HERE AS YOU WALK OUT ONTO THE STAGE
WITH BRITAIN'S NEXT MOMENT PRIME MINISTER HOW DOES THAT FEEL YES IT'S A VERY EXCITING MOMENT I SECOND
BRITISH WOMAN PRIME MINISTER AND A STICK RAY BUT THAT'S A TORY LADY SO WERE WALKING OUT OF SAINT STEPHEN'S ENTRANCE
WHERE THE CAMERAS ARE WAITING FOR THIS PHALANX OF TORY POLITICIANS AND I'VE GOT TO GET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MICROPHONES
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE ME THE BALL CONTROL OVER THEIR LIVES AND THAT'S HOW TOGETHER WE WILL BUILD A BETTER
NO PRIME MINISTER QUITE YET BUT AWARE THAT SHE WILL
IT'S ONLY FOR THE TODAY PROGRAMME THE MORNING TRYING TO SCAN A RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY OF THIS PARTY ONE MINUTE YOU'VE GOT DOZENS OF CABINETS THE NEXT YOU'VE GOT RID OF ALL OF MY ONE ALL WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE TESTED OUR CANDIDATES AND WE HAVE MADE SURE THAT THEY'VE GOT THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT THEY NEED FOR THE JOB BUT THEY ALSO KEPT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY
IT'S PERFECTLY CLEAR FROM THE MARKET INSTABILITY AND OR SAY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION NEGOTIATOR
I'M REALLY STARTING TO START TO BUBBLE UNDER THE SURFACE THAT WE NEEDED TO GET BACK TOGETHER YOU GET A MOVE ON AND SO WE RESPONDED TO THAT HE'S MADE A DECISION QUICKLY WELL WE'VE HAD IT HAS BEEN FAIR TO SAY A VERY QUICK LEADERSHIP CONTEST THAT I WOULD SAY THAT THE TWO LEADING LADIES FOUGHT IT WITH INTEGRITY
I THINK ANDY DID THE RIGHT THING SHE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY NEEDED LEADERSHIP QUICKLY AND IT WAS VERY GRACIOUS STEP ASIDE IS IT AN EXAMPLE TO THE LABOUR PARTY WHEN THE LABOUR PARTY ARE AGONISING ABOUT WHETHER TO AGONISE ABOUT A LEADERSHIP CONTEST IS THERE A LITTLE BIT OF YOU THAT SECRETLY THINKS
WE KNOW HOW IT'S DONE IN A BOTTLE WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S ALWAYS WISE TO TRY AND ADVISE ON THE PARTY'S ON HOW TO RUN THEIR LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS BUT ALL I'LL SAY IS LOADS OF LABOUR M.P.S HAVE BEEN COMING UP TO ME SAYING THEY WISH THEY COULD GET ON WITH THE SAME JOB AS QUICKLY
HOW DID IT HAPPEN HOW DID A TWO HORSE RACE MEANT TO LAST NINE WEEKS BECOME A RACE LASTING JUST TWO MORE DAYS IT ALL HAPPENED BECAUSE ANDREA LEAD SOME CONCLUDED ON SUNDAY THEY DID IT BECOME TOO MUCH AND LATE AT NIGHT
RANG FRIENDS AND ALLIES AND SUPPORTERS TO TELL THEM
THAT SHE WAS THINKING OR WITHDRAWING FROM THE RACE PRINCIPLE AMONGST THEM IAIN DUNCAN SMITH I THINK THE LAST WEEK WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF PERSONAL ABUSE AND ARE QUITE DELIVERED ATTEMPT TO DENIGRATE HER CHARACTER
ON A SCALE I WASN'T QUITE EXPECTING THE PROPENSITY OF PEOPLE TO DO THAT I THINK IT WAS WHAT IT'S LIKE THEY'VE MADE HER WONDER THAT IF THIS GOES ON FOR NINE WEEKS THEN THE PARTY WILL BE SEVERELY DAMAGED AND GOVERNMENT WILL BE DAMAGE WITH IT
I THINK SHE TOOK A FAIRLY BRAVE DECISION AND LIGHT OF DAWN AND SAID DO I REALLY WANT TO DELIVER THAT IF I HAD SAID TO YOU A FEW WEEKS AGO YOU WIN THE REFERENDUM AND THEN FIRST BORIS THEN MICHAEL GOES AND THEN ANDREA LEAD SOME WILL GET KNOCKED OUT OF THE RACE TO BE THE NEXT TORY LEADER
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE SAID TO ME I SAID THAT'S THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ALMOST AT ANY GIVEN OPPORTUNITY THEY WILL CONFOUND EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT WELL HAPPEN THEY HAVE DONE IT AGAIN AND I GUESS HE'LL CARRY ON DOING IT AGAIN BUT ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IT NEVER CEASES TO SURPRISE
# IT NEVER CEASES TO SURPRISE IAIN DUNCAN SMITH TALKING TO ME YESTERDAY THE TIME IS NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S THE EFFECT OF GLOBAL WARMING IS TO PRODUCE THE SORT OF FLOODING WE'VE BEEN WARNED TO EXPECT THERE WILL BE A DOMINO EFFECT ON ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES GAS I.T. CONNECTIONS EVEN FOOD PRODUCTION THAT'S WHAT THE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE IS GOING TO TELL US TODAY LORD CRIBS
OF THE ADAPTATION SUB COMMITTEE AT THE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND HE'S WITH ME GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOW THE DOMINO EFFECT MEANING WHAT LEFT LET'S ASSUME THE SCENARIO IS THAT THE WATERS RISE THERE'S SEVERE FLOODING ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT DOES THAT DO APART FROM CAUSE ENORMOUS INCONVENIENCE
WELL THIS REPORT WHICH IS COMING OUT TODAY IS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF ALL THE EVIDENCE WE'VE GOT UP TO DATE IT'S INVOLVED OVER EIGHTY AUTHORS TAKEN THREE YEARS TO PRODUCE HIS TWO THOUSAND PAGES LONG SO WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY THE VERY SIMPLE CONDENSED SUMMARY BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS OUT OF THE SIXTY ALSO RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL ARISE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE THERE ARE SIX THAT ARE URGENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTION ON ONE OF THOSE IS FLOODING
THE GOVERNMENT'S REALLY TAKING FLOODING SERIOUSLY AFTER PARTICULARLY AFTER LAST WINTER I'D LANCASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE OR LANCASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE FLOODS BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES REMEMBER DAWLISH WARREN A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD EVEN FLASH FLOODING IN LONDON JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK WHERE CARS WERE FLOATING IN THE STREETS AND PEOPLE FLOODED OUT OF THEIR BASE OF PEOPLE THERE SO WE'VE ALWAYS HAD FLOODS WE HAVE ALWAYS HAVE FLOODS BUT THE CLIMATE MODEL SUGGESTS THAT FLOODING IS GOING TO INCREASE IN INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY IN THE FUTURE
AND SO COMING BACK TO YOUR POINT WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF FLOODING ON INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES BUT ALSO ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND ONE OF THE POINTS WE DRY OUT IS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE ELECTRICITY COMMUNICATIONS TRANSPORT ARE ALL INTER CONNECTED AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO LOOK AT IS IS TO LOOK AT HOW THESE DIFFERENT
BITS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE COULD THROUGH A CASCADE EFFECT BE BROUGHT DOWN THAT CASCADE EFFECT WOULD WORK HOW THEN
WELL JUST A SIMPLE EXAMPLE IF IF THERE WAS A BRIDGE THAT WASHED OUT IN THE FLOOD AND THAT BRIDGE CARRIED UNIT COMMUNICATION'S CABLES TELECOMS AND ELECTRICITY THEN NOT ONLY WOULD THE TRANSPORT'S BE AFFECTED BUT THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY MAY LOSE ITS POWER AND MAY LOSE ITS TELECOMMUNICATIONS
FLOODING IS NOT THE ONLY RISK WE DRAW ATTENTION TO FOR URGENT ACTION I JUST MENTION A COUPLE OF OTHERS ONE IS FOOD PRODUCTION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE ARE DEPENDENT PARTLY ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE FOR A FOOD THEREFORE CLIMATE CHANGE IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE WE GET OFF FOOD FROM BUT ALSO OUR OWN SOIL BUT ALSO OUR OWN SOIL AND THAT THE SAD FACT IS THAT WE'RE NOT MANAGING OR SOIL SUSTAINABLY
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEAT SOIL IN IN EAST ANGLIA THAT'S THE MOST FERTILE SOIL IN ENGLAND EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THAT SOLIDUS DISAPPEARED SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY IF YOU GO TO A PLACE JUST SOUTH OF PETRA PETERBOROUGH THERE'S A GIANT METAL POST STICKING OUT OF THE GROUND THAT MARK THE TOP OF THE PEAT SOIL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY AND THAT'S NOW STICKING WAY UP IN THE AIR
IF WE CARRY ON AS WE ARE WE'LL HAVE LOST ALL THAT SOIL WITHIN A GENERATION RIGHT NOW YOU'RE DRAWING ATTENTION TO WHAT A POTENTIALLY CATACLYSMIC AFFECTS WHAT YOU'RE NOT DOING I ASSUME HE'S SAYING THIS IS WHAT IN GOVERNMENT MUST DO NOW WE ARE SAYING THAT THESE ARE LONG TERM EFFECTS BUT SOME OF THEM REQUIRE ACTION URGENTLY
TO BUY THE ACTION WE DON'T SPECIFY THE ACTUAL WE JUST SAY THESE ARE THE RISK THAT WE KNOW IF YOU DON'T ACT NOW YOU'LL REGRET IT IN TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS' TIME WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THE LONG TERM VIEW BECAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO SHIFT THINGS AROUND IF WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE A SOIL SUSTAINABLY WE NEED TO START NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN AMBITION TO DO THAT THEY SHOULD GO ON THE BASIS OF THIS RISK ASSESSMENT TELL US PRECISELY HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT LORD KREBS MANY THANKS THANK YOU
# IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN IF THE EFFECT OF GLOBAL WARMING I'M SO SORRY THE WRONG THING THERE MARK CARNEY'S GOING TO FACE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT THIS MORNING ON THE HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY AS ALWAYS SMALL BUSINESSES ARE VITAL DOMINIKA COP HAS THE LATEST ON THEIR MOOD THANKS THAT GUESS THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED AND THE POUND WERE BOTH UP YESTERDAY AFTER THERESA MAY'S CONFIRMATION AS PRIME MINISTER BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OF A SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE HAS ITS LATEST QUARTERLY SURVEY OUT TODAY
AND SHOWS A PRE LACKLUSTRE RUN UP TO THE EUROPEAN UNION VOTE ADAM MARSHALL'S THE ACTING DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BBC AND WHAT DOES A SURVEY SHOW MORNING DOMINIC I THINK WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT GROWTH IS STATIC IT BEST VERY MUCH IN A HOLDING PATTERN A LOT OF BUSINESSES WERE HOLDING BACK BUT THEY WERE HOLDING BACK AND NOT JUST PRIOR TO THE REFERENDUM BUT INDEED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS GROWTH REALLY BEEN SLOWING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME NOW ACROSS BOTH SERVICES AND MANUFACTURING AND WE NEED TO TAKE NOTE OF THAT AND TAKE THE APPROPRIATE ACTION SO NOT JUST THE BRICKS
VOTE CHILLING THINGS WELL WHAT ELSE IS SLOWING THINGS DOWN WELL OF COURSE YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THE CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE SLOW DOWN IN SOME OF THE EMERGING MARKETS WHERE WE WERE JUST STARTING TO SEE MORE BRITISH TRADE SOME UNCERTAINTY DOWN TO GEOPOLITICS AND EVERYTHING ELSE NONE OF THOSE THINGS HAD AN IMPACT ON BUSINESS MOOD WELL BEFORE THE REFERENDUM CAME INTERVIEW SO I LAST SNAPSHOT WHICH REALLY SHOWS WHAT WAS GOING ON RIGHT BEFORE THE REFERENDUM REALLY SHOWS SLOW AND ANAEMIC GROWTH WHAT THIS MEANS PEOPLE NOT HIRING NOT TAKING A BASEMENT DECISIONS JUST
PEOPLE SITTING ON THEIR HANDS THAT THERE WERE QUITE A LOT OF BUSINESS IS SITTING ON THEIR HANDS AND I THINK IT'S NOW INCUMBENT ON THE NEW GOVERNMENT WHEN WHEN IT IS APPOINTED TO START TAKING ACTION TO GET THE MOVING AGAIN AND THE BIGGEST THING THAT THEY COULD DO REALLY TO GIVE BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AND GET THE ANIMAL SPIRITS GOING AGAIN IT'S GET UP INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS GOING
TOO MANY OF THOSE HAVE BEEN DELAYED AS BUSINESSES LIKE LIKE OURS HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR A VERY LONG TIME PROBLEM OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE ARGUMENT THERE WAS A WAY TO SOME MONEY COME FROM WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY WERE BORROWING BORROWING SEVENTY FIVE BILLION A YEAR WOULD DO YOU REALLY SERIOUSLY SAY YOUR THE SMALL BUSINESS MEMBERS WILL BE HAPPY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO LOAD UP ON DIT WHICH THEY HAVE TO REPAY WITH HIGHER TAXES NOT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER OF COURSE THAT DEBT IS AT RECORD LOW PRICES OR GOVERNMENT CAN BORROW QUITE CHEAPLY RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE ON RECORD VERY MUCH SUPPORTING AN INFRASTRUCTURE BLITZ
WE NEED TO DO THAT WE CAN START WITH BROADBAND AND WITH HOUSES WHICH ARE PRETTY QUICK TO DO MOVE ON TO TRANSPORT AND ENERGY AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU CROWD IN BUSINESS INVESTMENT BECAUSE YOU MAKE THE MORE CONFIDENT YOU REALLY CROWD THEM AND GET THEM GOING AND JUST VERY QUICKLY WHAT DO SMALL BUSINESSES WANT FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION

BY HITTING PEOPLE IN THE WORKPLACE AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CONTEST OF IDEAS AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR THAT THAT'S NOT JUST OF IDEAS IT'S INTERESTING AS I'VE JUST LOOKING THROUGH SOME OF THE WAYS YOU VOTED OVER THE YEARS YOU VOTED IN FAVOUR OF OF THE IRAQ OH HANG ON A MINUTE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REPEAT OH COME ON DARLING THAT'S GOING AROUND TWITTER THAT THAT ISN'T THE POINT AT ALL IS IT THE POINT IS THAT IF WE GET THE LABOUR PARTY'S GOING TO ELECT A NEW LEADER
EVERYBODY HAS AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THAT MY VOTING RECORD IS OPEN I AM A LOYAL AND THAT'S ALL I WAS GOOD I AM ONLY OIL LABOUR PARTY MEMBER VOTED I SUPPLY AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE SPENT ON ON THEIR HEALTH OF VOTE I'VE TRIED AND I VOTED TO GET WELL I HOPE YOU DID NOT VOTE AGAINST THE WILSON HI WHO'S THAT YOU ARE RATHER MORE NUANCED IN YOUR APPROACH TO POLITICS THAN THIS ONE I AM I'M ON THE TOP I AM I AM YES NO MORE THAN
GIRL FROM WORKING CLASS ROOTS WHO UNDERSTANDS MODERN LIFE I THINK THAT OF COURSE ON TRIDENT I THINK THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO HAVE A PROPER DEFENCE I FAVOUR MINIMUM WAGE
I VOTED FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT TO MAKE SURE THIS COUNTRY HAD A NATIONAL ALL RIGHT WHAT YOU DO WHEN JEREMY WHEN THE CONSERVATIVES WERE ACTUALLY VOTING AGAINST IT AND SAYING IT WOULD BE A JOB DESTROY AND THAT HAS HELPED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE A BETTER LIFE AND WE HAVE TO GO VIA IN WAGES THE IMPORTANT LET ME LET ME SAY WHERE I'M DIFFERENT FROM JEREMY I WOULD PROVIDE STRONG LEADERSHIP I WOULDN'T BE HID IN MY ROOM NOT TALKING TO LABOUR MEMBERS AND I HAVE TO SAY ALSO
BUT JEREMY DIDN'T NOT CAMPAIGN WITH ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HE THEN CAME OUT AND SAID WE HAD TO SIGN ARTICLE FIFTY STRAIGHT AWAY THAT WOULD CAUSE CHAOS WE NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME DISENTANGLING OURSELVES IN EUROPEAN UNION IN A WAY WHICH DOES THE LEAST DAMAGE WE NEED TO BE VERY FOCUSED ON THAT SO I WOULDN'T RUSH TO THE EXIT AS I'VE JUST SAID ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD DO IMMEDIATELY HIS GUARANTEE
THAT E. YOU MINIMUM RIGHTS AT WORK OR GUARANTEED IN BRITISH LAW WE'VE ALSO GOT TO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE EQUAL PAY FOR WORK OF EQUAL VALUE WHICH AFFECTS MILLIONS OF WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND EASE YOU LAW WE WANT OUR GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT THAT ALL RIGHT WHY'S MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THE WOMEN AT WORK FACE HAVING THEIR WAY JUST CUT THAT CANNOT BE ACCEPT YOU USE THE WORD STRONG TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF AND YOU'D ACCEPT I IMAGINE THAT YOU'VE GOT TO BE PRETTY RUTHLESS AS WELL IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A POLITICAL LEADER
LEADER OF A PARTY AND YET THE NATION HEARD YOU SHEDDING A TEAR YEAH A COUPLE OF TIMES ON THE RADIO AND ON TELEVISION WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT JOANIE CALL GOING TO MANY PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HANG ON DON'T WE WANT SOMEBODY WHO WEEPS IN THE FACE OF THIS SORT OF THING CONFRONTING
HOOTIN FOOTING WELL LET ME JUST SAY THIS I TRIED FOR NINE MONTHS TO FULFIL MY PROMISE TO LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS TO TRY TO MAKE JEREMY CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP WORK AND IT WAS JUST
EMOTION AND THAT I HAD BEEN UNABLE TO DELIVER THAT DON'T THINK THAT SHEDDING A LITTLE YOU'RE ENTITLED TO DO IF YOUR LISTEN THERE ARE MORE THIS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO BE A LEADER AND I THINK BEING IN TOUCH WITH YOUR EMOTIONS IT'S QUITE AN IMPORTANT PLAYING THEM IS DIFFERENT FROM BEING INTO THEM CAN'T QUITE IMAGINE WAS IT DIFFICULT REASON EITHER WELL WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT I THINK WE WENT FROM LETITIA TITIAN'S OUGHT TO BE HUMAN BEINGS
AND LEADERS CAN BE HUMAN BEING BUT SHOULDN'T YOU BE ABLE YES INDEED BUT MY POINT IS SHOULDN'T YOU BE ABLE TO CONTROL THOSE EMOTIONS WHEN YOU'RE UNDER GREAT LOOK I'M NOT CRYING NOW AM I NO YOU STAY HERE IS WHETHER YOU'VE GOT A VISION FOR THE COUNTRY WHETHER YOU CAN PROVIDE STRONG LEADERSHIP TO UNITE THE LABOUR PARTY AND HEAL OUR COUNTRY IN THESE DANGEROUS TIMES I BELIEVE I'VE GOT ALL OF THOSE QUALITIES
# AND ILLEGAL THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED IT IS TWENTY TWO EIGHT WILL BE TALKING TO LEN MCCLUSKEY ANGELA'S CLOSE FRIENDS JUST BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS WHICH OF COURSE DOMINATED BY THE STORY THERESA MAY EMERGING AS OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER THE DAILY TELEGRAPH GIVES OVER THE WHOLE OF ITS FRONT PAGE TO A SHOT OF MISSUS MAY RECEIVE A KISS ON THE CHEEK FROM HER HUSBAND PHILIP OUTSIDE THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER THE PHOTOS ON THE FRONT OF THE TIMES TWO AND MOST OF THE OTHER PAPERS QUENTIN LETTS WRITES IN THE MAIL
THAT HE WAS THE MAN BEHIND IT GIVE HER A KISS I CRIED OBEDIENT FELLOW HE DID WRITE TO MISTER LETS THE SUN SAYS MISSUS MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER IT RUNS THE HEADLINE BRECK'S YOU'LL HEALING REPORTING THAT SHE'S PROMISED TO HEAL THE NATION'S E.U. REFERENDUM WOUNDS BUT THE PAPERS CARRY MORE THAN A WHIFF OF DISCONTENT THE TIMES HAS A CARTOON OF MISSUS MAY ENTERING NUMBER TEN ON A RED CARPET OF BLOOD SHE SEEN WALKING OVER THE BODIES OF LEADING LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS KNIVES STUCK IN THEIR BACKS ELSEWHERE
PAPER OR FIRST OF THE CURSE OF THE BRICKS ARE TEARS OF SEEM TAKEN UP BY TELLING GANESH IN THE F. T. IN THE BIZARRO WORLD OF BRITISH POLITICS HE SAYS A COUNTRY VOTED TO LEAD THE Y. YOU WILL NOW BE LED BY SOMEONE WHO WANTED TO STAY JOHN CRACE IN THE GUARDIAN SAYS CONSERVATIVE M.P.S HAVE COMBINED THE BRUTALITY OF THE STALINIST PURGE WITH THE LOW COMEDY OF A CARRY ON FILM THEY TRUSTED THE COUNTRY TO REACH THE RIGHT DECISION IN THE REFERENDUM BUT THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE BY GIVING THE UNTAMED FRINGES OF THE PARTY YOU SAY IN THE LEADERSHIP
WHAT OF THE OTHER TWO MAIN ACTORS IN YESTERDAY'S WESTMINSTER DRAMA DAVID CAMERON NOW ANDREA LEAD SOME THERE'S A MIXTURE OF RELIGION AND SYMPATHY FOR THEM BOTH THE MIRACLES THE OUTGOING PRIME MINISTER A SKIN DEEP SHOWMAN WHO PROMISED TO BUILD ONE NATION BUT THREATENS TO LEAVE A DISUNITED KINGDOM THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE CURTAIN HAS FALLEN BEFORE HE WAS READY TO LEAVE THE STAGE WITH MISSUS MAY SWIFT VICTORY
DASHING HIS HOPES OF DEFINING HIS LEGACY DURING A RELATIVELY LEISURELY LAST FEW MONTHS IN OFFICE THIS IS LEADS THE MAIL SAYS SHE RAN HER CAR CRASH CAMPAIGN ONE UNNAMED M.P. WHO SUPPORTED HER IS QUOTED SAYING SHE'S A GUTLESS COWARD WHO CONNED US INTO THINKING SHE WAS SOMETHING SHE WASN'T IN THE TIMES RACHEL SYLVESTER WHO CONDUCTED THE SORT OF MOTHERHOOD INTERVIEW WHICH PRECIPITATED HER DOWNFALL RIGHT THAT THIS WAS NOT A CANDIDATE WHO COPED WELL IN A CRISIS
BUT NORMAN TEBBIT IN THE TELEGRAPH SAYS MISSUS LEAD SUMMER'S BEEN VICTIM OF AN INTENSE SMEAR CAMPAIGN RUN BY SUPPORTERS OF MISSUS MAY OF COURSE SHE NEVER CLAIMED THAT BEING A MOTHER GAVE AN EDGE SHE MERELY EXPRESSED A NATURAL PRIDE IN HER FAMILY SAYS MUCH OF THE HATRED SHE SUFFERED A RISES FROM HER OPPOSITION TO GAY MARRIAGE FINALLY THE HOT QUESTION WHO'S GOING TO BE MISSUS MAY'S CABINETS THE TIME SAYS SHE'S PUT GEORGE OSBORNE'S TENURE AS CHANCELLOR IN DOUBT WITH A FIERCE ATTACK ON HIS FAILURE TO KAREN CARRY OUT DEEP ECONOMIC REFORM
HE FANCIES PHILIP HAMMOND THE FOREIGN SECRETARY TO TAKE OVER AT NUMBER ELEVEN BUT THE F.T. POINT OUT THERE MISSUS MAY HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT EASING BACK AUSTERITY AND SPREAD CHEAP FILLERS IT SAYS HE'S NICKNAMED IS A FISCAL HAWK THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
# TWO BROTHERS SEPARATED FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS WHO'D LOST ALL HOPE OF EVER SEEING EACH OTHER AGAIN HAVE HAD A REMARKABLE REUNION NOR AN ALLY I'M NOT THEIR REAL NAMES ARE SEPARATED IN AFGHANISTAN WHEN A WARLORD KILLED THEIR FATHER AND BURNT THEIR HOUSE DOWN
LAMB AND HIS MOTHER FLED TO PAKISTAN NOR ESCAPED TO EUROPE THEY LOST ALL CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER THEN THE SERENDIPITY STEPPED IN A LAMB HAPPENED TO MEET A MAN IN A PAKISTANI CAFE WHO IS VISITING FROM ENGLAND HE HAD A PICTURE OF GNAW ON HIS PHONE WITH THE HELP OF JOURNALIST EDWARD LAWRENCE ALARM TRACKED HIS OLDER BROTHER DOWN SO WE CONWAY WAS THERE FOR THE REEN
UNTIL THEN I CAN'T LET GO OF EACH OTHER
THEY ARE BASED CRYING
USING MY BRETHREN THEY LAST SAW EACH OTHER SEVEN YEARS AGO AT THEIR HOME IN A VILLAGE IN AFGHANISTAN
NOW THEY STAND ON A DIRT TRACK BY A MOTORWAY IN CALAIS IN THE SO CALLED
NEVER BELIEVED IN THINK BUT IT'S NOT A BIG MAN
YOU WERE REALLY TRY NOR HE WAS TWENTY TWO CAN HARDLY BELIEVE HOW HIS BABY BROTHER SIXTEEN YEAR OLD ALARM HAS GREY
HAND IN HAND THEY WALK TO THE WOODEN HEART ALARM HAS BEEN LIVING IN FOR THE LAST EIGHT
SO HOPEFULLY NOW IN MORE I'M ENJOYING MY LIFE ON MY VAN
SO THIS IS YOUR HOUSE AS WE SIT ON THE FLOOR OF THE SMALL PLYWOOD HEART THEY TELL THE STORY OF HOW THEY BECAME SEPARATED THEM NOR HAD BEEN OUT PLAYING WITH HIS FRIENDS IN THEIR VILLAGE HE RETURNED HOME TO FIND IT WAS ON FIRE
HIS FAMILY NOWHERE TO BE FOUND HAVE PEOPLE WAS HRANT WAS HAPPEN EITHER YOU COULD SEE THERE WAS A FIRE EXPLAIN TO COMMUNE AN EGO HORNBY ANNOYED HE WOULD NOW ASK PRIYA SHOWED BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE MY FAMILY HIS FATHER HAD BEEN KILLED BY A LOCAL WARLORD HIS MOTHER HAD FLED WITH ALARM
NO MADE HIS WAY TO EUROPE HE TRIED AND FAILED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HIS FAMILY
IT WAS A CHANCE ENCOUNTER IN A CAFE IN PAKISTAN TWO YEARS AGO THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE BOYS' REUNION AT THE CAFE A LAMB GOT CHATTING TO A MAN WHO WAS VISITING FROM THE U.K. THE MAN SHOWED HIM PHOTOS ON HIS PHONE AND UP POPPED A PICTURE OF NOEL SAID THAT IF THE LAW NOW TRANSLATES FOR ALARM
I SAW YOU A PICTURE ON THE PHONE FIRST I THINK YOU UNTIL THAT MOMENT ALARM HAD NO IDEA THAT HIS BROTHER WAS IN ENGLAND I TOLD HIM BECAUSE HE'S MY BROTHER HOW DO YOU KNOW BROTHER
WHAT HOW DOES HE FEEL WHEN HE SAW THE PHOTO THE EXCITING MOMENT BECAUSE WHEN I SAW YOU A PICTURE BECAUSE I WAS A CON CONTRA MY HARD MY GOD PLUS SHOWED THEY CAN OPEN THEIR JUMP HE BEGS FOR MAN TO PUT HIM IN TOUCH WITH NO BUT THE MAN DIDN'T BELIEVE HE WAS HIS BROTHER
ALARM SAYS THEIR MOTHER DIED HEARTBROKEN WORRYING ABOUT THE SON SHE WOULD NEVER SEE AGAIN
WAS GOING OH LOUIS I MEAN SHE WAS SHE GO TO A PICTURE
BEEP AFTER HIS MOTHER DIED ALARM TRAVELLED TO CALAIS WHERE HE MET A FREELANCE JOURNALIST WHO HELPED HIM TO FIND HIS BROTHER
SENT CHOCOLATES NOR HAS BROUGHT GIFTS FOR HIS BROTHER INSURED WITH ONE BODY SPRAY
ALARM IS IMPATIENT TO GET TO ENGLAND AND MUCH TO HIS BROTHER'S DISTRESS HE TRIES AT NIGHT TO BOARD LORRIES BOUND FOR THE U.K.
IN THEORY UNDER E.U. AGREEMENT ALARM SHOULD BE ABLE TO JOIN HIS BROTHER AND APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN BRITAIN
BUT IT COULD TAKE MONTHS FOR THE AUTHORITIES IN BOTH COUNTRIES TO PROCESS HIS CLAIM
FAR MORE THAN THE SHELLEY AFTER JUST A FEW HOURS TOGETHER NORMA SLEEVE ALARM BEHIND IN CALAIS AND CATCHES FERRY BACK TO BRITAIN
ANSWER
THIS IN THE FINAL NOW THAT HE'S SEEN YOU'LL BE FINE
HE PROMISES TO RETURN SOON AND BEGS HIS BROTHER TO BE PATIENT I DON'T KNOW ME VERY WELL THEN THEY'RE MADE OF MONEY ONE DAY HE SAYS WE WILL HAVE A BEAUTIFUL LIFE
# SO HE CONWAY REPORTING THERE IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EAT AND IT IS TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A CAMBRIDGE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE WRITER ANNE ATKINS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING JOHN
MY CLERGYMAN GOD GRANDFATHER WAS TALKING TO A WOMAN IN A HAT AFTER A WHILE HE SAID HE'D ENJOYED MEETING HER AND HOPE TO MEET HER HUSBAND TO YOU ARE MY HUSBAND SHE SAID I BLAME THE HAT
IT RUNS IN OUR FAMILY PROSPER GROWS HERE OR FACE BLINDNESS RECENTLY FEATURED IN THE PROGRAMME WHO ARE YOU AGAIN MY PATERNAL UNCLE AND AUNT CHATTED FOR TEN MINUTES AT THE PARTY BEFORE WORKING OUT HOW THEY KNEW EACH OTHER I SOMETIMES FAILED TO RECOGNISE MY OWN CHILDREN ARE ONE OF OUR SONS SELDOM HAS ANY IDEA WHO HE'S TALKING TO HE ASKED THE PRETTY GIRL HE'D KNOWN ALL HIS LIFE FOR HER NAME THEN SAID I KNOW SOMEONE CALLED EXACTLY THE SAME HOW DAUGHTER SPOTS PEOPLE BY THEIR DOGS
I DO HOWEVER RECOGNISE VOICES AND NOTES AND IT'S NOT THAT I CAN'T SEE YOU WHEN I'VE HAD TO GIVE POLICE STATEMENTS BY PAGES OF DETAILED DESCRIPTION HAVE CAUSED ADMIRED ASTONISHMENT BUT MY BRAIN INTERPRETS SOUND OVERSIGHT MY LAPTOP IS COVERED IN IRRITATING INCOMPREHENSIBLE ICONS INSTEAD OF EASILY INTELLIGIBLE WORDS MY DISABILITY IF IT THIS ONE WAS BEING BORN INTO AN AGE OF FISSION
IT WAS NOT ALWAYS SO SHAKESPEARE'S PLOT ARE FULL OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY THAT SEEMS FAR FETCHED TO SOME BUT NOT TO ME
CLOTHES BEING THEN FAR MORE EXPENSIVE AND PERHAPS LIMITED TO ONE OR TWO OUTFITS PROVIDED VITAL SOCIAL AS WELL AS PERSONAL CLUES VIOLET POSING AS A BOY MODELLED HER WARDROBE ON HER LOST BROTHERS SUE OF COURSE WAS TAKEN FOR HIM
THESE PLAYS WRITTEN FOR AN AUDIENCE RATHER THAN SPECTATORS PROVIDE ALL IN THEIR LANGUAGE SCENERY AND WHETHER GESTURE AND ACTION AS WELL AS CHARACTER
IT WAS NOT JUST THE ELIZABETHANS ON EASTER MORNING MARY DIDN'T RECOGNISE HER RISEN LORD UNTIL SHE HEARD HIS VOICE SAUL OF TARSUS REALISED THE TRUTH WHEN HE LOST HIS SIGHT AND HEARD HIS NAME CALLED RESUS LIKE THE VISIONARY HOMER WAS PHYSICALLY BLIND BUT THE ONLY ONE WHO RECOGNISED OEDIPUS
I WONDER WHAT WE LOSE WITH THE ART OF THE ORAL ON THE TELEVISION PRESENTING KIRK COURSE I HEARD THAT AT THE AGE THAT MOST COMMUNICATION IS BODY LANGUAGE I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT UNTIL WE WATCHED THE RUSHES THE SMILE THE OUTFIT WHAT ALL UNLIKE ON RADIO WHERE CONTENT IS PARAMOUNT WORDS SEEMED VIRTUALLY IRRELEVANT BUT HOW CAN WE CHANGE OUR MINDS LET ALONE OUR LIVES WITHOUT THE LOGIC OF LISTENING
THE MODERN IDEA THAT SEEING IS BELIEVING IS AT ODDS WITH JUDAEA CHRISTIANITY WHEN THOMAS LIKE FILER A TWIN USED TO VISUAL CONFUSION SAID HE COULDN'T BELIEVE UNTIL HE'D SEEN
JESUS COMMENDED BY CONTRAST THOSE FOR WHOM TESTIMONY IS PROOF SEEING REALLY SHOWS US THE EVIDENCE SPEAKING EXPLAINS AND INTERPRET IT
FAITH COMES FROM HEARING AND HEARING FROM THE WORD WROTE SAINT PAUL
IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD THE WORD WAS WITH GOD AND THE WORD WAS GOD THE APOSTLE JOHN ILLUSTRATES HOW LANGUAGE ILLUMINATES LISTENING HE'S LEARNING
IN AN ASTONISHING PARADOX IT IS THE WORD THAT SHINES LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS
# THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH ATKINS THE TIME IS TEN TO EAT WHEN YOU PRIME MINISTER'S MOVE INTO NUMBER TEN THERE'S USUALLY A LOT OF SPECULATION AS TO WHAT WILL BE TOP OF THEIR AGENDA NO NEED TO GUESS WHAT IT'LL BE FOR THERESA MADE BRICKS IT OF COURSE AND TO USE HER OWN WORDS MAKING BREAKS IT A SUCCESS
WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF WHAT SHE MIGHT STAND FOR THE REST OF HER DOMESTIC AGENDA THERESA MAY'S FAULT NO GENERAL ELECTION SHE PUBLISH NO MANIFESTO SO WHAT CAN WE KNOW ABOUT HER PLANS A CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS HAS BEEN LOOKING BACK AT THEIR CAREER TO TRY TO SPOT THE CLUES
THE NEW CONSERVATIVE LEADER HAS MADE A CAREER OF TELLING HER PARTY WELL IT DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR OPPORTUNISM
INTELLECTUAL SELF INDULGENCE IDEOLOGICAL OBSESSIONS QUICK FIXES EASY ANSWERS I'M AFRAID THEY'VE ALL GOT TO GO
THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN A YOUNG MODERNISER CALLED DAVID CAMERON WAS THE TORIES FRESH HOPE THAT SAME YEAR THERESA MAY'S STARTED WOMEN TO WIN A CAMPAIGN TO MAKE THE CONSERVATIVE BENCHES A LITTLE LESS MALE ALONGSIDE A COLLEAGUE AND JENKIN SHE KNEW THAT WE LOOKED SEXIST THAT WE LOOKED ANTI WOMEN AND THAT YOU KNOW WE HAD TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS BY HAVING MORE WOMEN IN PARLIAMENT
SHE STUCK HER NECK OUT VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AND WAS QUITE HAPPY TO RATTLE THE CAGE OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHICH AT THAT TIME DIDN'T SEE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND DIDN'T THINK IT MATTERED
AND IN THAT CAGE RATTLING HER THEN CHIEF OF STAFF NOW TORY M.P. ANDREW GRIFFITHS SUGGESTS THERE'S A HINT ABOUT HER FUTURE IN GOVERNMENT
I THINK IF ANYTHING TO REASONABLE TAKE WHAT DAVID CAMERON ACHIEVED FURTHER AND FASTER DAVID CAMERON WAS A MODERNISER AND I THINK THERESA MAY WILL TURBO CHARGED
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE COUNTRY BEYOND THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY EVEN SOME OLD FRIENDS LIKE DAVID WILLIAMS WHO SERVED ALONGSIDE HER AS A COUNCILLOR AREN'T CERTAIN I'VE KNOWN HER FOR PROBABLY THIRTY YEARS I'VE NEVER HEARD HER ASSOCIATE HERSELF WITH A PARTICULAR LINE OF THINKING I'VE NEVER SEEN HER AS BEING SOMEBODY THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO EASILY PEN LABEL ON AS BEING RIGHT WING OR LEFT WING
BEYOND THE PROMISES HE'S MADE ABOUT BRECHT'S IT THEN IS SHE THE RIGHT WINGER WHO'S HOME OFFICE SENT OUT VANS WITH ADVERTS TELLING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO GO HOME OR FACE ARREST OR IS SHE THE LIBERAL WHO THEIR TREATMENT PROGRAMMES GIVE FOIL TO DRUG USERS NORMAN BAKER A LIB DEM COLLEAGUE OF HERS AT THE HOME OFFICE WHO WENT ON TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE
SHE WAS HAPPY TO AGREE TO A SUGGESTION OR DRUG USERS SHOULD BE HANDED PARAPHERNALIA IN ORDER TO ENABLE THEM TO SMOKE ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES RATHER THAN INJECTING THEM WHICH IS ACTUALLY A VERY LIBERAL POLICY AND A VERY SENSIBLE ONE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH POINT TO BE QUITE A RISKY ONE FOR A CONSERVATIVE
IT'S NOT SUCH A MYSTERY IN A SPEECH THREE YEARS AGO SHE SET OUT THEMES OF REFORMING CAPITALISM CHALLENGING EXECUTIVES PROTECTING SOME INDUSTRIES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN HER BRIEF CAMPAIGN AND PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND HER THINKING REPEATEDLY DIRECTED ME TO A SCATHING ARTICLE BY HER FORMER AND CURRENT CLOSE AIDE NICK TIMOTHY WHICH SAYS THERE'S A MINORITY OF PEOPLE IN THEIR PARTY WHO FRANKLY DO YOU NOT CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT OTHERS AND THAT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT'S GOT IT WRONG ON HOUSE BUILDING
IMMIGRATION ON PROTECTING PENSIONER BENEFITS HE ASKS SHE HOUSE WHAT DOES THE TORY PARTY OFFER WORKING CLASS FAMILIES AND THE POLITICIANS KNOWN FOR HER CAUTION MAY BRING MORE CHANGE THAN SOME EXPECTS ANDREW GRIFFITHS
WHEN SHE CAME TO PARLIAMENT AND SAW AND THE CLIQUES SAW THE OLD BOYS' NETWORK SAW THE WAY THAT THINGS OPERATED I THINK SHE GOT FRUSTRATED ABOUT THAT AND I THINK SHE WAS DETERMINED TO CHANGE IT SHE DOESN'T WANT BUSINESS AS USUAL
BUT AS TWERE REZA BEGINS TREAT TALES FROM THOSE CLAIMING TO BE ON FIRST NAME TERMS WITH HER WITH CAUTION
I ASKED THAT FRIEND DAVID WILLIAMS A SIMPLE QUESTION WHETHER YOU'D EVER MANAGED IN THIRTY YEARS ACQUAINTANCE TO MAKE SMALL TALK WITH A FUTURE PRIME MINISTER
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I'VE HAD A CONVERSATION SORT OF SAT IN A PUB WHERE THEY DRINK IN HAND AND I HAVE BUT WHETHER YOU COULD CALL THAT SMALL TALK I'M NOT TOO SURE
IT WAS A LONG WAY OF SAYING NO HE HASN'T ROSS HAWKINS REPORTING THERE JOIN ON THE LINE BY A SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH TODAY NORMAN YESTERDAY OF COURSE THE TORIES ALL TALK AS IF THEY'RE ALL DELIGHTED THAT THERESA MAY'S TAKE EM THEY'RE ALL UNITED BY
SHE IS GOING TO FIND THERE'S A MIGHTILY HARD PARTY TO MANAGE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ISN'T SHE I THINK HER BIG BIG CHALLENGE OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE WHICH IS FACE SUCCESSIVE TORY PRIME MINISTERS WHICH IS EUROPE THERE'S NO GETTING AWAY FROM IT IT IS THE ISSUE WHICH IS BROKEN SUCCESSIVE PREMIERSHIPS AND IT IS THE ONE THAT WILL CONFRONT HER STRAIGHTAWAY SHE WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT BRICKS IT ACTUALLY MEANS AND ALREADY THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNALS FROM THOSE AROUND HER LIKE PHILIP HAMMOND THAT FOR HER BRECHT SAID
IS A NEGOTIATION THAT THERE WILL HAVE TO BE SOME SORT OF FINESSING AROUND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT WILL ALARM IF YOU LIKE THE BRICKS IT HARD LINERS FOR WHOM ENDING FREE MOVEMENT IS AN ABSOLUTE SO SHE LIKE EVERY TORY PRIME MINISTER I THINK WILL HAVE TO TRY AND ENSURE HER PREMIERSHIP IS NOT TOTALLY OVERWHELMED
AND POTENTIALLY CAPSIZED BY THIS ISSUE OF EUROPE AND ITS PURPLEY POSSIBLY THAT IT COULD BE COULDN'T IT AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT I AM TO JOHN MAJOR IT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO DAVID CAMERON AS WE NOW KNOW AND WITH A MAJORITY THIS SMALL THERESA MAY WILL FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AND I THINK THE DIFFICULTY IN ADDITION TO THAT IS LISTENING TO HER SPEECH IS SO FAR SHE CLEARLY WANTS TO SET OUT HER OWN DISTINCTIVE DOMESTIC AGENDA SHE DOES NOT JUST WANT TO BE A BOLT ON
TO THE CAMERON OSBORNE YEARS SHE'S TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE ECONOMY A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO GOVERNMENTS HAVE A CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF FOCUS ON WORKING PEOPLE I SUSPECT A DIFFERENT STYLE OR SLIGHTLY LESS MEDIA FOCUS STYLE OF GOVERNMENT AS WELL BUT HER ROOM TO SKETCH OUT THIS DIFFERENT AGENDA MAY BE PROFOUNDLY COMPROMISED BY THE ENORMITY
OF THE CHALLENGE OF BRECHT SAID AND THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH WILL BE SAPPED FROM HER AND HER GOVERNMENT BY HAVING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND OR EXCESS AND IN EFFECT SHE COULD BECOME THE BRACKS IT PRIME MINISTER NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE HAD HOPED TO TALK TO LEN MCCLUSKEY AT THIS TIME BUT WE MADE THAT MANAGED TO LOSE HIM BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE HEARD NORMAN SMITH'S RINGTONE THAT WORTH IT FOR THAT LOAN MISTER MCCLUSKY WE WILL HERE AT TWENTY PAST EIGHT WE WILL NOW HEAR THE WEATHER FORECAST FROM
# I SAW JOHN WORTH MANY VISITS BEEN QUITE A CLOUDY START TO THE DAY BUT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME SUNSHINE COMING THROUGH NOW TODAY THOUGH A DAY OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS THOSE SHOWERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN AFFECTING WALES AND SOUTH WEST ENGLAND SO LET'S START WITH THE FORECAST DETAIL HERE
SHOWERS WILL CLEAR THEN THROUGH THE MORNING AND THE AFTERNOON LOOKS BRIGHTER WITH SOME SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES OF AROUND EIGHTEEN DEGREES WITH A FRESH NORTHWESTERLY BREEZE TO THE BREEZE IN THE SUNSHINE PROBABLY NOT FEELING TOO BAD ACROSS THE MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA SOUTH EAST ENGLAND HERE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME SUNSHINE COMING THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING SHOWER THE HADDOCK IN KENT IS CLEARING AWAY FROM THE EAST COAST AND THROUGH THE REST OF THE MORNING GOING TO START TO SEE SOME BIG CLOUDS DEVELOPING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON THOSE SHOWERS WILL FORM SOME REALLY HEAVY ONES TODAY THE HEAVIEST OF WHICH COULD BRING US
HALF A MONTH'S WORTH OF RAIN IN THE SPACE OF JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS SO THERE IS THE RISK OF SOME LOCALISED SURFACE WATER FILLING SOME CLAPS OF THUNDER AND TEMPERATURES BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY ONE IN NORTHERN ENGLAND ESCAPING THE WORST OF THE DAY'S WEATHER SHOULD STAY DRY AND BRIGHT WITH SOME SUNNY SPELLS FOR MOST AREAS JUST A FEW MORNING SHOWERS ACROSS THE PEAKS AND ITS PARTS OF YORKSHIRE BUT CLEARING QUICKLY HIGHS OF AROUND EIGHTEEN DEGREES
IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND ACTUALLY WE'RE STARTING THE DAY ON A CLOUDY NOTE BUT IT'S REASONABLY BRIGHT AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE MORNING WE'LL SEE SOME SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH BUT AGAIN WE ARE GOING TO SEE A FEW SHOWERS THE SHOWERS WILL TEND TO BE QUITE ISOLATED TODAY LIMITED REALLY TO THE WESTERN ISLES IN THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND THEY'LL BE MORE WIDESPREAD IN NORTHERN IRELAND WHERE THERE COULD BE ONE OR TWO HEAVY ONES AND TEMPERATURES FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND PEAKING AT AROUND SEVENTEEN DEGREES WITH NORTH WESTERLY BREEZE BLOWING TODAY MAKING HER FEEL A LITTLE ON THE FRESH SIDE SO

THE RAPID HANDOVER OF POWER IS BOTH A BLESSING AND A BURDEN FOR MISSUS MAY IT MEANS SHE'LL HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY OVER THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO SHAPE A NEW GOVERNMENT AND DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH PROMINENT FIGURES LIKE GEORGE OSBORNE BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO MISSUS MAY THERE'S ALSO PLEDGED TO CREATE A BRECHT SAID MINISTER WHICH SHE'S PROMISED WE'LL GO TO HER LEAVE SUPPORTER
WITH NO LEADERSHIP CONTEST THOUGH MISSUS MADE DOES NOW HAVE TIME TO WORK OUT HER STRATEGY FOR BRECHT SAID AHEAD OF THE LIKELY START OF NEGOTIATIONS IN THE AUTUMN AND THIS MORNING THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON A SUPPORTER OF MISSUS MAY SAID THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE OF BRECHT SAID REINFORCE MISSUS MAYS CASE FOR NOT HOLDING AN EARLY GENERAL ELECTION

ALTHOUGH THOSE AROUND MISSUS MAY HAVE SIGNAL SHE WANTS TO SET OUT HER OWN DISTINCTIVE DOMESTIC AGENDA WITH THE FOCUS ON WORKING PEOPLE SHE'S LIKELY TO FACE IMMEDIATE PRESSURE FROM SOME IN HER PARTY NOT TO COMPROMISE OVER BRECHT SAID AND TO END FREE MOVEMENT
HER CHALLENGE TO ENSURE HER GOVERNMENT IS NOT OVERWHELMED BY THE ISSUE OF EUROPE THE ISSUE THAT HAS BROKEN THE PREMIERSHIP AND SUCCESSIVE TORY PRIME MINISTERS

# AN EXPERT REVIEW HAS FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT TAKING MULTI VITAMIN TABLETS DURING PREGNANCY IMPROVES THE HEALTH OF MOTHERS OR THEIR BABIES ALTHOUGH IT SAYS WOMEN SHOULD TAKE FOLIC ACID AND VITAMIN D.

THE TABLETS ARE OFTEN MARKETED AS BEING VITAL FOR MOTHER AND BABY DELIVERING ALL THE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS FOR PREGNANCY AND CAN COST ABOUT FIFTEEN POUNDS A MONTH WHILE RESEARCHERS FOUND STRONG EVIDENCE THAT FOLIC ACID REDUCE THE RISK OF CONDITIONS SUCH AS SPINE ARE BITTER AND SOME SIGNS THAT VITAMIN D.

THE WINTER FLOODS IN LANCASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE WASHED AWAY BRIDGES AND TAUGHT CLIMATE ADVISERS A LESSON BECAUSE THOSE BRIDGES DIDN'T JUST CARRY CARS THEY ALSO SUPPORTED PIPES AND CABLES AND WHEN THE BRIDGES FELL INTO THE RIVERS SO DID PEOPLE'S HEATING ELECTRICITY AND INTERNET
WE RISK A CASCADE OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS THE REPORT SAYS
FARMING IS ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN THE MOST FERTILE SOILS IN EAST ANGLIA ARE BEING WASHED AWAY AND BLOWN AWAY THE REPORT SAYS AND THAT FORECAST IT'LL GET WORSE AS THE CLIMATE HEAT UNLESS FARMERS CHANGE THE WAY THEY PLAY
THE U.K.'S AGEING POPULATION IS ALSO AT RISK THE COMMITTEE WARNS THAT HEAT RELATED DEATHS WILL TRIPLE AND LESS VENTILATION IS IMPROVED IN HOMES CARE HOMES AND HOSPITALS THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE ADVICE WE'LL INFORM ITS POLICY
# ARCHAEOLOGISTS WHO HAVE CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF THE SOUTH DOWNS NATIONAL PARK USING A LASER MOUNTED ON AN AIRCRAFT SETS UNCOVERED EVIDENCE OF PREHISTORIC FARMING ON AN ASTONISHING SCALE
THEY'VE DISCOVERED A HUGE FIELD SYSTEM BURIED UNDER ANCIENT WOODLANDS IN WEST SUSSEX AND HE'S HAMPSHIRE WHICH INDICATES THE ENTIRE AREA WAS ORGANISED AS A FARMING COLLECTIVE THE TEAM SAY THEIR DISCOVERY SUGGESTS THAT PRE ROMAN BRITAIN WAS FAR MORE ADVANCED THAN PREVIOUSLY REALISED THAT ON IT'S TEN PAST EIGHT DAVID CAMERON WOULD SHARE HIS LAST CABINET MEETING THIS MORNING THERESA MAY WILL CHAIR FIRST NEXT
# TUESDAY MORNING THERE WILL BE MANY MINISTERS AND BACKBENCHERS GLANCING NERVOUSLY HAVE THEIR PHONES WAITING FOR THE CALL THEY HELP WILL COME FROM THE NEW PRIME MINISTER OFFERING THE JOB THEY WANT SO THAT'S ONE TO ASK MISSUS MAY HAS TO DEAL WITH OVER THE COMING DAYS PUTTING TOGETHER A CABINET THEN SHE HAS TO TACKLE
THE BIG ONE HOW TO DEAL WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL LEAD TO THIS COUNTRY LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION I'M JOINED BY TWO POLITICIANS ON EITHER SIDE OF THAT PARTICULAR DIVIDE THERESA VILLIERS NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY SHE VOTED COURSE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION KEN CLARKE
FORMER CABINET MINISTER HIMSELF AS WE KNOW WHO THE LEAVES I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY MY CLERK REGARDED THE REFERENDUM AS AN ABOMINATION I DO THINK IT'S A PRETTY PECULIAR WAY OF DECIDING ACTUALLY DOZENS AND DOZENS OF COMPLICATED QUESTIONS WE'VE GOT WRAPPED UP IN THE BIG QUESTION IN A MODERN SOPHISTICATED STEAK RIGHT SO THERE WE ARE WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE ARE AND I DON'T THINK BEFORE WE GET ONTO THAT A QUICK WORD FROM EACH OF YOU ABOUT THE CABINET FIRST WILL PRESUMABLY AGREE THERE WILL BE BIG MASSIVE CHANGES
THERE IS I THINK IT'S HARD TO SAY BUT ONE WOULD EXPECT A NEW PRIME MINISTER TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES I'M SURE TERESA WARM TO DRAW ON TALENTS FROM ACROSS THE PARLIAMENTARY CHANGED THE CHANCELLOR CHANGED FOR A SECRETARY
I THINK IT WOULD BE PRESUMPTIOUS OF ME TO MAKE I DICTION WAS ON IS THAT COS YOU'RE IN THE CABINET BUT YOU MISTER CLARK DON'T HAVE TO BE COY ABOUT THESE THINGS IF WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER BLOODY TYPICAL WOMAN I DID SO SHE WAS GOOD AT THAT HE'S ALL RIGHT NOW COMPARED WITH MARGARET THATCHER OVER THE CAMPAIGN PEOPLE THOUGHT I'D GIVEN HER THE BIGGEST PLUG SHE COULD HAVE HAD SO FAR I'M GOING ALL RIGHT WITH THERESA AND THERESA'S ENTITLED TO HAVE HER OWN CABINET AND I ACTUALLY THINK HAVING A TOUGH PRAGMATIC WOMAN
IS PROBABLY ABOUT RIGHT I WAS ONE OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE I GAVE STEPHEN CRABB A FRIENDLY VOTE THE FIRST KNOWING HE WOULDN'T WIN THEN SWITCH TO THERESA AND SHE'LL HAVE HER OWN CABINET SHALL HAVE AROSE IN THE INFANT BUNCH I WOULDN'T GUESS FIRSTLY TO MAKE HER OWN MIND UP BUT ONE OF US ALL OVER THE BURB BURB ABOUT UP SHE'S GOT TO BALANCE THE PARTY SHE'S GOT A REAL PROBLEM ARE BRINGING THEIR WARRING WINGS OF THE PARTY TOGETHER
ER SHE IS SHE'LL COMBINE HER OWN STRONG PERSONAL OPINIONS ABOUT WHO SHE WANTS TO WORK WITH WITH A DESIRE TO BRING THE PARTY TOGETHER MAJORITY ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT EASILY GOT IT DOES I'M YEAH IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH ANYWAY TO DO DIFFICULT THINGS AS GEORGE OSBORNE HAS BEEN FINDING EVER SINCE THE ELECTION WAS OVER AND TO ACTUALLY GET THE REAL HEADBANGERS TOGETHER BOTH SIDES AND TO SEE FOR YEARS OF GOVERNMENT THROUGH
WILL REQUIRE SOME POLITICAL SKILLS AND FREEZERS WAY BUT SHE SHE'S PRAGMATIC SHE'LL WANT TO GET ON AND DO THINGS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A REST FROM SOUND BITES AND PUBLIC RELATIONS AND ALL THE STUFF THAT SIMPLY ROUSED PUBLIC ANGUS'S RING DOESN'T GET RID OF THE SOUND BITES COME ON THERESA VILLIERS ABOUT A BETTER ONE IT'S NOT THE ONES ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT IN THERE SINCE THE BLAIRITE DAY ASK TERRY BUT I DO WHETHER YOU'RE ONE OF THE HEAD BANGERS BUT SHOULD SHE
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A BRICK CITY SHOULD SHE BALANCE OF THE CABINET
WELL AS ONE AUJAS I I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT BOTH REMAIN AS AND LEAF CAMPAIGNERS WILL BE REPRESENTED IN THE SHOWER I'VE GOT TO BE BALANCES REALLY THE PARISH I THOUGHT AND I'M SURE SHE WOULD WANT YOU KNOW A CABINET THERE WILL SEEK TO UNIFY THE PARTY BUT I WOULD URGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE RESHUFFLE TO BE INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE NEW PRIME MINISTER I NEED A LABEL IF SHE ONLY HAD HER TWO OR THREE WRECKS IT AND ALL THE REST REMAIN AS YOU WILL BE VERY PLEASED WITH THAT WOULD YOU
I I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY A MATTER FOR OUR NEW PRIME MINISTER HOW SHE CHOOSES HER CABINET BUT SHE NEEDS SUPPORT FROM EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY WE NEED TO MAKE A SUCCESS OF THIS BRECHT'S IT DECISION AND THE WAY WE DO THAT IS BY DELIVERING STABLE GOVERNMENT AND THE WAY WE DELIVER STABLE GOVERNMENT IS BY GIVING FIRM BACKING TO OUR NEW PRIME MINISTER WHAT ABOUT THE MANDATE KEN CLARKE SHOULD YOU THINK ABOUT A FAIRLY EARLY ELECTION MAYBE NOT NO
AFTER THE LAST MONTH OR TWO OF CAMPAIGNING THE IDEA OF NOW HAVING A ELECTION YOU'LL HAVE THE ENTIRE PUBLIC PROTESTING AND VERY PECULIAR RESULT THEY MIGHT SAY WE WANT TO VOTE IN OUR OWN GOVERNMENT THE WAY FOLLOWING A LONG STANDING CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE OF COUNTLESS
PRIME MINISTERS WHO'VE TAKEN OVER BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY WE HAVE A FIXED PARLIAMENT PIECE OF LEGISLATION SO WE'VE GOT FOUR YEARS AND WHAT THE RISEN HUGE LIST OF VERY DIFFICULT
PROBLEMS THAT THERESA AND HER GOVERNMENT TO RETREAT FOR MAY AND A GOVERNMENT HAVE GOT TO GET THEIR HEADS ROUND AND THE PRESS ARE SO LOVING ALL THIS PERSONALITY STUFF
THAT THEY WANT ANOTHER ELECT WE DIDN'T MAKE IT UP YOU KNOW IT WAS YOU LOT YOU'VE GOT IT GOING IT WAS RESPONDED TO WITH ENTHUSIASTS HELD BY TOO MANY POLITICIANS LIKE WELL INDEED THERE RIGHT SO WHAT SHOULD THE NEXT STEP BE WHAT SHOULD THAT ARE AS REGARDS ARTICLE FIFTY WELL HER SHOULD SHE HAVE DOES SHE HAVE DO YOU BELIEVE IN HER HEAD A TIMETABLE OF WHEN SHE WILL ACTUALLY INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY
I HOPE YOU'VE GOT NOTHING FIXED AND AHEAD COS I HAVEN'T EITHER TO YOU NEEDS TO TERRIFIC AMOUNT OF STUDY TO WORK OUT THE TACTICS WHAT SHE WANTS AND NEGOTIATE ARTICLE FIFTY STARTS THE PROCESS YOU CAN'T START THE PROCESS UNTIL YOU'VE WORKED OUT YOUR OWN NEGOTIATING AINS THEN YOU'VE GOT TWO YEARS AT LEAST NOW THE OTHER THING IS IT IS A NEGOTIATION
SO YOU ARE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH TWENTY SEVEN OTHER GOVERNMENTS ALL OF WHOM HAVE GOT THEIR PARLIAMENTS THE MEDIA THEIR INTERESTS I ACTUALLY THINK WE'VE GOT ONE COMEDY INTERESTED WE COULD ALL DAMAGE OUR PROSPERITY FOR THE FUTURE IF WE DON'T NEGOTIATE FOR SUITABLE CONCLUSION THAT ALL KINDS OF THINGS YOU CAN LEAVE ON ONE SIDE IT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY SECURITY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY WAS TO REASON MOST BACKWARDS AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS
BUT SORT OUT THE OUTLINES OF ECONOMIC AND TRADING RELATIONSHIPS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE DONOR REQUIRED GATE SKILL WHICH COULD BE FAIR I THINK EVERYBODY REALISES THE NEW GOVERNMENT REQUIRE A WEEK OR TWO BEFORE IT'S READY TO TRIGGER ARTICLE THIRTY FIVE A WEEK OR TWO
WELL WE CAN'T JUST DRIFT ON WITH UNCERTAIN TRY BECAUSE OUR OWN BRITISH POLITICS KEEP LARKING ABOUT THEY'VE ALL GOT TO GET A TEAM TOGETHER NEGOTIATE WORK OUT WHAT THEY WANT YOU KNOW I WAS IT WAS A VERY SHORT TIME TO ISABELLA'S WHAT DO YOU THINK LIKE THE HOUSE AND SHE DREW THE ARTICLE FIFTY WHAT IT'S LIKE AND I DON'T THINK THERE IS A NEED TO RUSH INTO TABLE WHAT DO YOU HAVE A RIGHT FIFTY
I THINK WE NEED A PERIOD AS KEN SAID TO PREPARE ON NEGOTIATING POSITION LOOK AT ALL THE OPTIONS AND I THINK I HAD SOME INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER EUROPEAN MINISTERS AND THEY'D HAVE TO BE INFORMAL BECAUSE YOU CAN'T UNDER THE OTHER OF THE RULES YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY SORT OF FORMAL NEGOTIATION UNTIL YOU PUT A GOOD ARTICLE FIFTY BUT THAT'S CORRECT BUT I DO THINK THERE IS A WILLINGNESS IN THE REST OF EUROPE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND AS IN ALL OUR INTERESTS
THE INTEREST OF OUR EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURS AND OURSELVES TO GET A SENSIBLE AND CONSTRUCTIVE TO LOOK BUT I'M GOING TO A NATION SHORT I'M SURE ARE QUITE CLEAR WHEN YOU THINK ON FIFTY SHOULD BE TRIGGERED HOW SOON ARE WE TALKING WEEKS OR MONTHS I I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T PUT A DATE ON IT AT THE MOMENT NO BUT I THINK THEY RECOGNISE THE NEED TO GIVE AS MUCH CERTAINTY AS POSSIBLE SURE BUT THEN THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO GET YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA OF HOW SOON IT SHOULD HAPPEN THEY'LL GIVE ME A DATE AND EXPECT THAT BUT BUT A ROUGH IDEA OF
I'M A KNIGHT I CERTAINLY THINK DO YOU KNOW ANOTHER TWO OR THREE MONTHS OF INFORMAL DISCUSSION IS NO TRACE OF THAT WELL YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET VERY FAR FOR A START WITH INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS THE OTHER EUROPEANS CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THEY DO GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE BRITISH AT THE MOMENT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT NO NAWAB WRECKS IT MEANS SO THEY ADDED INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WERE GOING TO MAKE YOUR MIND UP WHAT A VISUAL ISN'T GONNA GET RIVER ALL THEY WISH
WE SHOULD HAVE COME WITH DEFINITELY A BRITISH POSITION AND OF COURSE IT WILL INVOLVE DIDN'T TAKE WE WON'T GET THE BRITISH POSITION WHATEVER WE START WITH RIGHT TABLE SHOULD BE WHAT THEIR TIMETABLE SHOULD BE A PIG WILL TAKE A FEW WEEKS TO GET A BRITISH NEGOTIATE MAGICIAN COS NO TWO BRICKS THEIR NEW TRICK A LOT OBVIOUSLY AFTER A FEW WEEKS YOU TRIGGER ARTICLES AND THEN YOU SET THEN YOU REALLY GET DOWN WITH THE MOGO SHITTING TEAM HEADED BY AT LEAST ONE CABINET MINISTER
A TEAM OF EXPERTS TO REALLY AND I WOULD BEGIN I THINK BECAUSE OF THE RISKS TO THE REAL ECONOMY NOT JUST OF FINANCIAL MARKETS GOING DOTTY BUT THE FACT THAT NOBODY'S GOING TO INVEST THAT WHERE I FEAR LIKELY TO GO INTO A RECESSION IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS I HOPE I'M WRONG WE NEED TO GET ON WITH CLARIFYING THE TRADE AND ECONOMIC POSITION FIRST THANK YOU WE'LL BE AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH KEN CLARKE AND THERESA VILLIERS I SUPPOSE IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT
# AND ATTEMPTED POLITICAL LYNCHING A SQUALID COO WHO'S PLOTTERS WILL BE BRANDED FOREVER WITH THE MARK OF INFAMY THOSE THE TO BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE ATTEMPT TO REMOVE JEREMY CORBIN IS LABOUR'S LEADER BEING USED BY A MAN WHO SAYS THAT HE WANTS TO RE ESTABLISH MUTUAL RESPECT BETWEEN LABOUR M.P.S AND THE REST OF THE PARTY HE IS OF COURSE LEN MCCLUSKEY GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE UNITE UNION AND HE'S IN BRIGHTON FOR THE UNIONS CONFERENCE
MORNING TO YOU MISTER MCCLUSKY GOOD MORNING EH IF THAT'S HOW YOU TALK WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH MUTUAL RESPECT WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU SAY WHEN YOU WANT A BIG ROW BUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SAYING IT HOW IT IS BUT OF COURSE THE WRONG ALAN SQUALID LYNCHING AND WELL THERE'S THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS A POLITICAL LYNCHING IT WAS SQUALOR AND IT CONTINUES TO BE SQUABBLE AT THE REALITY OF COURSE IS THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE ON FROM THIS AND THAT'S WHY I'VE CALLED
FOR THIS ELECTION FOR THE LEADERSHIP TO BE CONDUCTED IN A CIVILISED THE WAY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN I'VE ALREADY YOU QUOTE PART OF MY SPEECH
BUT YOU DIDN'T QUOTE WAS MY CALL FOR A RECONCILIATION WITH THE P. L. P. RIGHT HARD TO RECONCILE WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY'RE GUILTY OF A SQUALID COUP A LYNCHING GOT THE MOULD LAWRENCE QUITE IT'S QUITE EASY NICK IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME THE REALITY IS I ALSO SAID THAT LABOUR M.P.S CONCERNS HAD TO BE ADDRESSED AND THERE HAD TO BE A RECONCILIATION SO OF COURSE FATS
AN OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE IN THE ELECTION THAT WERE NOW ABOUT TO GO INTO LET'S TEST THIS MUTUAL RESPECT IF WE COULD IF LABOUR'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE DECIDES TODAY THAT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY INCLUDING JEREMY CORBIN MUST HAVE THE SUPPORT OF AT LEAST FIFTY M. PEAS WILL YOU RESPECT THAT DECISION NO I THINK THAT WOULD BE SEEN AS A SWORD IT FIX I THINK IT WOULD BE ALIEN TO THE TRADITIONS OF THE LABOUR
PARTY INDEED IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE ALIEN TO THE CONCEPT OF NATURAL JUSTICE FOR JEREMY CORBIN IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY ON THE BALLOT PAPER THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE MISTER MCCLUSKEY IS THE SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED BODY OF YOUR PARTS AND SO I DON'T KNOW YOU SAY NO I WON'T RESPECT NO NO IT IS SO THE RULE SNAKE IN THE RULES ARE NOT AMBIGUOUS ON THIS IT SAYS VERY CLEARLY
WHERE THERE IS NO VACANCY WHERE THERE IS NO VACANCY AND THERE ISN'T ONE THE CHALLENGER MUST GET FIFTY ONE OR TWENTY PERCENT OF M.P.S CLEARLY FORGIVE ME YOU'VE CLEARLY CLEOME ALL THE WHAT INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES COS THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE LEGAL OPINION AND WE'VE GOT SOME DOUBT ABOUT WHAT THE OUTCOME BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A QUESTION OF AN INTERPRETATION OF THESE RULES THEY'RE FAIRLY SIMPLE IF THEY WANNA READ THAT
YOU'LL SEE THAT IT'S QUITE CLEAR THE CHERRY COME ON BLIMEY MAKE THIS AND YOU GO TO COURT LET ME JUST GET THIS WOULD YOU DON'T KNOW LET'S LET'S NOT RUSH AHEAD OF OURSELVES NICK WE'RE NOT RUSHING YOU SEEN A MEMBER WHICH HAS A WARRANT TO GO TO THAT WOULD YOU BACK LET ME LET ME JUST I'M SHREDDING THIS WAY EVANGELINE OR IN OR ANYBODY ELSE WISHES TO CHALLENGE THE INCUMBENT AND IT'S THEIR RIGHT TO DO SO OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T NEED ALL THIS HISTRIONICS OF
OF RESIGNATIONS THEY COULD HAVE DONE THIS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WITHOUT OR WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH IF THEY WANT TO CHALLENGE THE INCUMBENT THEN SURELY THE BASIS OF NATURAL JUSTICE AND THE BRITISH SENSE OF FAIR PLAY THAT INCUMBENT HAS TO BE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES
IN THE ARENA OF DEBATE THE CRUSH OF A MILLION PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM LESS THAN TEN MONTHS AGO AT LEAST HAVE THEIR SAY THAT SURELY THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS O.K. SO YOU DON'T RESPECT THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVES RIGHT TO MAKE THIS DECISION DO YOU EXPECT VOTERS SAY THAT WELL YOU DID AN EFFECTIVE I DIDN'T THAT THAT O.K. LET'S MOVE ON TO THE VOTERS THE LATEST OPINION POLL SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT TORI LEE
BUT THE CONSERVATIVES WOULD WIN A GENERAL ELECTION IF IT WAS HELD NOW NOW DO YOU RESPECT VOTERS' OPINIONS OF JEREMY CORBIN ARE THEY WRONG AS WELL NO OF COURSE I RESPECT EVOKED IS THE VOTES THE REAL VOTES THAT WE'VE HAD NOT THE OPINION POLLS SO FAR HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN THE FOUR BY ELECTIONS THERE WE'VE HAD SOME TO JEREMY'S LEADERSHIP LABOUR
HAS WON ALL FOUR AND INCREASE THE MAJORITY SIGNIFICANTLY LOST SEATS IN THE COW WE WILL ELECTIONS THEY OPPOSITION HAD EVER DONE FOR NICK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY UNFAIR AS YOU WELL KNOW HE LOST EIGHTEEN SEATS AGAINST THE HIGH WATERMARK OF ED MILLIBAND LEADERSHIP OF TWENTY TWELVE THE TORIES LOST FORTY EIGHT SEATS HE WAS EXPECTED BY MANY OF HIS ENEMIES TO LOSE A LOT MORE ON THIS COUP AS YOU KNOW HAS BEEN BREWING
FOR QUITE A WHILE ONE OF THE SORT OF PEOPLE I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR OWN MEMBERS DUE RESPECT THEIR VIEWS NOW AN OPINION POLL BY YOU CURVE SAYS THAT TWO THIRDS OF YOUR MEMBERS OF THE UNITE UNION SAY THAT HE'S DOING A BAD JOB MY ALMOST HALF OF THEM SAY HE SHOULD STEP DOWN NOW ARE THEY THE PEOPLE YOU RESPECT WHICH WHICH OF COURSE DOWN IN MY POLICY CONFERENCE WHY DON'T YOU COME DOWN HERE AND ASK A THOUSAND DELEGATES WHO REPRESENTS HON MEMBERS FROM EVERY SINGLE
VILLAGE FROM EVERY SINGLE TOWN AND CITY IN OUR NATION'S ASK THEM WHAT THEY THINK I DON'T KNOW WE'VE ASKED ORDINARY MEMBERS ARE REPULSED OUR HOUSE WHO THOUGHT ULSTER ORDINARY MEMBERS ISN'T IT AGAIN YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT THESE KIND OF POLES CAN BE TWISTED AND INTERPRETED IN ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WEBER LOOK NICK HERE'S THE TRUTH FORGET ABOUT FORGET ABOUT THE POLES FORGET ABOUT EUCH EUCH OF EVANGELOS OR I WANT OR ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO CHALLENGE JEREMY THAT'S FINE
JEREMY SHOULD BE ON THE BALLOT PAPER AND WE SHOULD TRY TO CONDUCT THE CAMPAIGN IN A CIVILISED MANNER I WILL ACCEPT THE RESORTS I WILL ACCEPT THE RESULT I HOPE EVERYBODY ELSE WELL O.K. BUT I WON'T ACCEPT A FIX AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY WHAT APPEARS TO BE DEVELOPING AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS DEEPLY REGRETTABLE LAST ONE SEE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU USED THE LANGUAGE OF RESPECT
BUT YOU DON'T RESPECT THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVES RIGHT TO MAKE HIS OWN DECISION YOU DON'T RESPECT THE VOTERS' VERDICT ON MY CORBIN AND APPARENTLY NOT YOUR OWN MEMORIES AND A BOWL THE TRUTH THAT'S THE TRUTH IS MISTER MCCLUSKY YOU HAVE DECIDED YOU'VE GOT CONTROL OF THE LABOUR PARTY AND YOU'RE SIMPLY NOT GOING TO LET YOUR LEG MICK THAT'S NONSENSE AND IT ISN'T TO YOUR JOURNALISTIC CREDIBILITY AT ALL THE REALITY IS OF COURSE I EXTRACT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
OF THE LABOUR PARTY LET JEREMY GO ON THE PAPER LET HIM BE INVOLVED IN THE ARENA OF POLITICAL DEBASE UNLESS AMEN BAZ IN THE LABOUR PARTY DECIDE WHO THEY WANT AS THEIR LEADER I WILL ACCEPT THAT DEMOCRATIC ROLE
WHAT I WANT TO ACCEPT IS ANY SORDID LITTLE FIX WHICH IS ALIEN TO OUR TRADITIONS O.K. LEN MCCLUSKEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JODIE

I THINK THAT THEY'RE JUST USING THE DIZZY VIRUSES AS A BIT OF AN EXCUSE IN SOME WAYS IS THAT A LOT OF GOLFERS IT'S VERY HIGH ON THEIR AGENDA BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE TOP FEW ON THE MEN'S SIDE ESPECIALLY DECIDING THAT THEY WOULD RATHER NOT BE THERE AND WANT TO TAKE A WEEK'S REST
LET'S FACE IT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY WHY THEY OF COMPETING AT THE GAMES AND WHEN YOU TRAINED AS AN ATHLETE FOR FOUR YEARS TO TRY AND GET TO THE BIGGEST EVENT IN SPORT WITHIN MY SPORT IT CERTAINLY IS THE OLYMPIC GAMES IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THINK VERY HARD ABOUT PULLING OUT YOU'RE A KEEN AMATEUR GOLFER WHEN YOU FEEL LESS INCLINED TO WATCH THE OLYMPICS AND THE GULF
NO NOT AT ALL BUT ANY ANY SPORTS ARE DONE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OLYMPICS OR OUT OUTSIDE I WILL WATCH AND VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT NO HINT OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE BRITISH ROWING TEAM BECAUSE AS THEY CAME IN I ASK THE QUESTION BECAUSE ROWING'S A WATERBORNE SPORT A DISEASE SPREAD BY MOSQUITOS YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONCERN

ARE SAYING IT IS SAFE TO COMPETE IT'S WHO THEY ARE REALLY PUTTING THE OLYMPIC GAMES ON THE LINE IF THEY THINK THERE IS ANY ISSUE AT ALL JUST THINK WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM

REFERENDUM
# LABOUR'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WILL DECIDE THIS AFTERNOON WHETHER JEREMY CORBIN HAS TO GET THE SUPPORT OF AT LEAST FIFTY ONE LABOUR M.P.S AND ANY PEAS TO TAKE PART IN THE LEADERSHIP CONTEST B.B.C. NEWS OR SEEN A SOLICITOR'S LETTER THREATENING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE GOVERNING BODY IF HE IS PREVENTED FROM AUTOMATICALLY SENDING THE HEAD OF THE UNITE UNION LEN MCCLUSKEY TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT IT WOULD BE A SORDID FIX OF MISTER CORBETT WAS NOT AUTOMATICALLY ALLOWED ONTO THE BALLOT PAPER
# AN EXPERT REVIEW HAS FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT TAKING MULTI VITAMIN TABLETS DURING PREGNANCY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF MOTHERS OR THEIR BABIES ALTHOUGH IT SAYS WOMEN SHOULD TAKE FOLIC ACID AND VITAMIN D. MANUFACTURERS SAY THE STUDY DOESN'T TAKE ACCOUNT OF U.K. DIET
# A UNITED NATIONS TRIBUNAL IS SAID TO GIVE HER LONG AWAITED RULING ON CHINA'S CONTROVERSIAL TERRITORIAL CLAIMS OVER ALMOST ALL THE SOUTH CHINA SEA THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN TURNING REEFS INTO ARTIFICIAL ISLANDS CAPABLE OF BEING USED AS MILITARY BASES
# TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE IT'S EMERGED OVERNIGHT THAT THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES INCLUDING THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE DID THEIR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT AMERICA WOULD NOT LAUNCH A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AGAINST THE GREAT BRITISH BANK H.S.B.C. AND JOINED BY DOMINIC CON OLD DOMINIC THIS IS
ALL ABOUT A MONEY LAUNDERING INVESTIGATION BY THE DEPARTMENT IT IS AND YOU REMEMBER THE PHRASE THAT WAS COINED AFTER THE CREDIT CRISIS TOO BIG TO FAIL ONE NOW WE'VE GOT A NEW ONE TOO BIG TO JAIL IT GOES BACK TO THE PUB OR JUST HAD A LONG RUNNING INVESTIGATION STARTED AFTER THE CREDIT CRISIS INTO MONEY LAUNDERING BY TWO BRITISH BANK STANDARD CHARTERED H.S.B.C. AND C'S CASE THERE WERE SOME VERY DAMAGING ALLEGATIONS MONEY LAUNDERING FOR THE MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS ARRAIGN RAIN ORGANISATIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE CLEARLY BEEN A BREACH OF AMERICAN SENTIENT
IF THIS HAD GONE ON TO A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION THE AMERICANS PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TAKEN AWAY A A LICENCE TO DEAL IN DOLLARS EIGHTY SPECIE A BIG INTERNATIONAL BANK WITH UNABLE TO DIONNE DOLLARS IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE END OF H.S.B.C. BUT CERTAINLY WHEN THEIR FACE A VERY HEALTHY FUTURE
NOW THERE'S BEEN THE DISLOCATION BY THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE KIND OF THEM RATHER LIKE ONE OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEES AND IT'S UNCOVERED ALL SORTS OF PRESSURE BEING PUT ON THE AMERICANS BY AMERICAN REGULATE BY BRITISH REGULARS EXCUSE ME INCLUDING GEORGE OSBORNE AND I'VE GOT A LITTER THE JAWS OR GEORGE OSBORNE WROTE TO BE IN NINETY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE
AND HE SAYS AND IT'S NOT MY INTENTION TO AND FROM INTERFERE WITH YOU OR YOUR ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY BUT HE GOES ON TO SAY AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL FIND THIS AMAZING THE SCALE OF THIS ENFORCEMENT ACTION PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE STANDARD CHARTERED CASE IS LEADING MANY TO SUGGEST THE U.K. BANKS ARE BEING UNFAIRLY TARGETED WHICH ISN'T IT FOR A CHANCELLOR TO SAY IN THE FACE OF WHAT COULD'VE BEEN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BY THE U.S. AUTHORITIES RIGHT AND HOW DID THEY RESPOND TO THAT
IN THE END A CBBC DID NOT FACE A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION WE THINK THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE WE CAN'T KNOW EXACTLY IN THE END THAT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE REPORT SAYS THAT PRESENTS ALL THIS EVIDENCE HE SAYS THIS WAS A PRESSURE WAS BEING PUT ON IN THE END OSBORNE MAKES THE POINT I THINK THIS IS A POINT THAT WAS ACCEPTED BY THE APARTMENT JUST AS AMERICA IF YOU SHUT DOWN H.S.B.C. YOU SHUT DOWN
A BIG CHUNK OF THE WORLD ECONOMY AND YOU'LL END UP CUTTING OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE WE HAVE TO DO IS I THINK THE THAT THIS IS A RATHER BORING AN OBVIOUS POINT TO MAKE IT IF THEY DID SOMETHING WRONG SOMETHING THAT WAS IF OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS DESERVING OF A CRIMINAL CONVICTION SOMEBODY GOING TO JAIL WE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T HAVE GOT INVOLVED IN THAT SHOULD BE AT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT AND I THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY RELEVANT GIVEN THERESA MAY'S SPEECH YESTERDAY WHICH HE TALKED ABOUT SHARING THE BENEFITS OF OF CAPITALISM
THE CONSERVATIVES NOT BEING TOO CLOSE TRY NOT TO BE TOO CLOSE THAT WAS A SEMI WILL HEAR YOU HAVE YOU HAD HER CHANCEL HER CHANCE THERE FOR THE MOMENT ANYWAY SHOWING THAT HE IS VERY CLOSE TO AND REMEMBER H.S.B.C. WAS AT THAT POINT ONE OR A FEW YEARS AFTERWARDS TALKING THAT WITH HER AT LIFT THE YOU CASE WE DID HAVE A BIG LEVER TO PULL IN THE END IT PAID A ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR FIND TO THE AMERICANS TO SETTLE IN TO A BIG FINE BUT NO DRIP
# MANY BAGS TWENTY FIVE TO NINE NOW PRIME MINISTER THE SEQUEL WAS NOT THE ONLY THING PREMIERING IN LONDON LAST NIGHT
IMPACT COULD BE WORSE IT'S NOT IT'S A RECOGNITION GUIDE
JASON BOURNE WOULD COME
THE LATEST IN THE BLOCKBUSTER BORN FRANCHISE AT ITS EUROPEAN PREMIERE LAST NIGHT THE AMNESIAC AGENT MAYBE ALL FICTION BUT HE LIVES IN WHAT IS FOR MANY AN ALL TOO REAL WORLD CONJURED INTO LIFE BY THE BRITISH DIRECTOR FORMER DOCUMENTARY MAKER STORE WARS OF GRANADA'S WORLD IN ACTION PAUL GREENGRASS I MET PAUL YESTERDAY AND ASKED HIM WHY HE FELT LIKE THIS WAS THE RIGHT TIME TO RETURN TO THE BOURNE FRANCHISE AFTER NEARLY A DECADE AWAY
THE FIRST THING I DID ACTUALLY GO TIMOTHY I WAS I SAT AND WATCHED THE FIRST THREE IDENTITY SUPREMACY AND ULTIMATUM
AND IT WAS AMAZING TO ME HOW WELL THEY REFLECTED THE SORT OF PARANOIA OF THE MID NOUGHTIES PERMIT TWO THOUSAND
WHICH WITH THE YEARS OF THE BUSH ASCENDANCY IN THE WAR IN IRAQ AT ALL THE KIND OF MISTRUST AND PARANOIA THAT I THINK GOT INJECTED INTO OUR CULTURE AT THAT TIME AND SO THE IDEA OF THIS CHARACTER RUNNING AROUND SAYING THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT IS AND I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR IT REALLY SPOKE TO THOSE TIMES
BUT NOW WE'RE IN
A DIFFERENT TIME IT'S TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE MADE THE LAST ONE THERE WAS BARELY ANY SOCIAL MEDIA AND THERE YOU HAVE THESE GIGANTIC CORPORATIONS IN THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE GROWN UP LITERALLY WITHIN A DECADE
YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE POWER BASE OF THE OPPOSITION THE HACKING COMMUNITY THE OTHER JULIAN ASSANGE IS SNOWDON'S THAT'S PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED THE LANDSCAPE AND
IT'S GIVEN RISE TO INSTABILITY AND IT'S GIVEN RISE TO A MULTIPLICITY OF POWER SO
WHAT YOU GET TO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU START THIS BALL MOVIE IS WELL HE CAN'T JUST BE OPPOSED TO THE C.I.A. THERE ARE OTHER POWERS OUT THERE AND SO THAT GIVES US OPPORTUNITIES AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY'S AGONISING ABOUT WHAT ITS MOOD IS PACE BRICKS IT MAYBE BEAUTIFUL MAKE AS A BETTER PERSON TO ASK THAN A POLITICIAN WHAT'S OUT THERE
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I MEAN AT THE MOMENT I THINK IT'S CONFUSION WE'RE JUST NOT IN A STABLE PLACE
SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED IT SEEMS TO ME IN OUR POLITICS WHERE WE'RE EXPERIENCING LOSS OF POWER LOSS OF CONTROL IN A PROFOUND WAY
LISTEN I MIGHT I'M A REMINDER
BUT YOU COULDN'T BE NOT STRUCK BY WHAT A CHORD THAT PHRASE TAKE BACK CONTROL
IT HAD POWER IT REALLY DID
WITH PEOPLE THAT'S I THINK HOW PEOPLE FEEL THEY FEEL A GREAT LOSS OF CONTROL
ACROSS A WIDE SPECTRUM OF OF LIFE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE CHALLENGE NOW OF POLITICS AND IT IS A VERY VERY PROFOUND CHALLENGES HOW DO YOU
REGAIN CONTROL AND TALKING IN THE BROADEST SENSE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BRICKS IT HERE IT'S THE MOTORS OF GLOBALISATION IS SO POWERFUL
BUT I THINK POLITICIANS OF WHATEVER PERSUASION ARE FINDING IT VERY HARD TO GET A PURCHASE ON IT GREEN ZONE AND ANOTHER MEDIA DIRECTED ALL ABOUT OF COURSE GRETA AND IN BAGHDAD ABOUT THE SEARCH FOR WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
WHEN YOU SAW THE REALITY AND THE CHILCOTT REPORT DID HE TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T FEEL YOU ALREADY KNEW
I MEAN I ONLY READ THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND I OBVIOUSLY WATCHED TWO COTS INTRODUCTION AND MY WATCH TONY BLAIR'S PRESS CONFERENCE AND IT WAS
DEPRESSING I FOUND ON A HUMAN LEVEL
I WAS STRUCK BY HIS ANGUISH I THOUGHT BUT HE WAS GENUINELY ANGUISHED AND I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO BE A BLIND OR A BLINKERED PERSON NOT TO FEEL
I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM BUT BUT I I CAN SEE
IT'S PART OF THE SAME THING I MEAN IF SOMEBODY AS COMMANDING AS TONY BLAIR WAS IS REDUCED TO THE
FAIRLY PITIABLE HUMAN AND INTELLECTUAL POSITION THAT HE WAS IN OF NOT REPUDIATING SOMETHING THAT'S CLEARLY WAS A MISTAKE AND YET FEELING AGONISED
IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE ELECTORAL POLITICS HAS GOT TO IN TERMS OF CHILL CUT ITSELF
I WOULD HAVE EIGHT VOTED IN FAVOUR AT THE TIME I BELIEVED IT
THAT'S WHY I MADE GREEN SON BECAUSE I FELT SO SORELY ITS FIRST SHOCKED AND ANGRY WHEN IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE
TRUE THAT'S WHY I MADE THAT FILM ABOUT A CHARACTER A YOUNG AMERICAN
OFFICER WHO WAS GIVEN THE JOB OF FINDING THE W.M.D. HE WENT THROUGH THE JOURNEY THAT I THINK ALL OF US WENT THROUGH HE WENT IN BELIEVING THEY WERE THERE AND THEN THAT FIRST SCENE HE FINDS THEY'RE NOT THERE ON THEN HE WANTS TO KNOW WHY WHAT HAPPENED
JOURNEY WAS THE ONE THAT WE WENT THROUGH AND I THINK THAT IT HAS HAD
PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR TRUST
LAST TO TODAY AND I'LL GETTING WORSE I THINK TERRY FINAL QUESTION ABOUT MOVIES
YOU'VE MADE THE BOURNE SERIES AND MANY PEOPLE ARGUE YOU'VE CHANGED EVERY OTHER SERIES IN THE PROCESS BOMBED FOR EXAMPLE FANCY HAVING A GO AT HIM LATER
HONESTLY AND TRULY NOW I MEAN I KNOW BARBARA BROCCOLI SHE SHE'S A WE'VE DISCUSSED IT
IT'S A BIT LIKE THE FOOTBALL TEAM YEAH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU CAN'T
YOU DON'T NEED A MAN AND I LIKE THAT HOW ALEX AND I'VE SAID BEFORE YOU KNOW I THINK
LISTEN IT'S A GREAT GREAT FRANCHISE OF COURSE IT IS IT'S BEEN GOING FOR FIFTY YEARS IT GOT A SALUTE IT SUCCESS
BUT SPEAKING PERSONALLY AS A FILM MAKER I THINK ENCODED IN BOND ARE A SERIES OF VALUES ABOUT BRITAIN ABOUT THE WORLD ABOUT MASCULINITY ABOUT POWER ABOUT THE M.P.
THAT I DON'T SHARE QUITE THE REVERSE WHEREAS SEEM BORN I THINKING CODE IT IS MUCH MORE SCEPTICISM THERE'S A NON SOME OF THEM BORN HE'S AN ASS
WHEREAS BOND IS WORKING FOR THEM AND SO SPEAKING AS ONE OF THE PEOPLE AS A KID IT WAS ALWAYS AT THE BACK OF THE CLASSROOM AND BREAD ROLLS ON DEFINITELY ON THE BORN SIDE OF THE FENCE OR A GRASS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
# TIME NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE ON EX PRIME MINISTER IT IS AS YOU KNOW TO BE A WOMAN SHE GOT THE JOB AFTER HER OPPONENT A WOMAN DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE AND IF IT IS OF COURSE A MIGHTY BIG IF JEREMY CORBIN IS DEPOSED THERESA MAY MAY WELL FACE A WOMAN AS THEIR NEXT LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION WOMEN ARE ALSO IN CASE YOU'D NOT NOTICED FIRST MINISTERS IN BOTH SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND TOO
SO SOMETHING CHANGED IN OUR POLITICAL CULTURE WAS THE VERY FACT THAT WE STILL REGARD THIS IS NOTEWORTHY A SIGN OF HOW FAR WE STILL HAVE TO GO LET'S SPEAK TO THREE WOMEN WHO IF THEY'LL FORGIVE ME FOR TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN'S AGE REPRESENT THREE POLITICAL GENERATIONS SHIRLEY WILLIAMS FORMER LEADER OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IN THE LORDS OF COURSE JOINS US FROM HOME MARIA MILLER FORMER CULTURE SECRETARY IN THE COALITION GOVERNMENT IS HERE AND SHE LOOKS TO BE LABOUR M.P. FOR HAMPSTEAD IN KILBURN TO SHIRLEY IF I MAY BRING BEGIN WITH YOU
DID YOU EVER SEE THINK YOU'D SEE A DAY LIKE THIS IN WHICH SO MANY WOMEN WERE IN TOP POSITIONS OR FIGHTING FOR THEM
GOOD MORNING WELL I'M VERY PLEASED ABOUT IT IT'S A REAL BREAKTHROUGH IT'S WORTH SAYING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK BACK TO WIN A BOY OR A BOY OR A GIRL WAS A SCHOOL THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE SHAPING OF THEIR WHOLE CHARACTER AND WE'RE LOOKING REALLY AT A GENERATION WHO WERE EDUCATED IN BRITAIN IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WHICH IS WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SWINGING BRITAIN ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THE UNITED KINGDOM WAS MOVING TOWARDS A MUCH MORE MODERN SUITS HER
AND A LOT OF THOSE YOUNG WOMEN WHO TODAY ARE INDEED LEADERSHIP POSITIONS OR CHALLENGING FOR THEM WERE EDUCATED AT POINT AT WHICH GIRLS BEGAN TO BE SEEN AS EQUAL INABILITY TO BOYS AS APPOINTMENT COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS HAVE MADE FAR MORE SCHOOLS CO EDUCATIONAL AND THEY USED TO BE AND WHERE GIRLS WERE BEGINNING TO GET INTO UNIVERSITY AT LEVELS AND HIS SCALES ARE QUITE UNKNOWN IN EARLIER GENERATIONS ON TIME ON A CERTAIN SHIRLEY WILLIAMS WAS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION
OH YES OF COURSE THERE'S AN ICE USED TO SAY THAT I DO THINK THE SUMS ARE DOING IT MARIA DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT AS IT WERE THIS IS THE LEGACY OF WHAT HAPPENS A LONG LONG TIME AGO IS THAT SOMETHING CHANGED THE CULTURE OF POLITICS I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE OF THE TWO I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF POLITICS REALLY WHEN MARGARET THATCHER BECAME PRIME MINISTER WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN SHE WAS THE FACE OF POLITICS FOR ME BROUGHT POLITICS TO LIFE AND MAY BE INTERESTED IN IT
AND PERHAPS MORE RELEVANT BECAUSE SHE WAS A WOMAN BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO BEEN A SHIFT IN THE CULTURE AND POLITICS AS WELL OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS I JOINED PARLIAMENT TEN ELEVEN YEARS AGO NOW AND THE CHANGES THAT ARE QUITE REMARKABLE IN THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME YOU LIVE DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE AT A MOMENT OF CHANGE OR DO YOU THINK THERE'S A REAL RISK OF COMPLACENCY AND EVEN SAYING THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTICE THAT WE DO HAVE MORE WOMEN IN POLITICS NOW ESPECIALLY LEADERS BUT GOOD GOVERNANCE ISN'T JUST ABOUT ONE PERSON IT'S ABOUT PULLING THE
PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS STILL A THIRD OF WOMEN IN PARLIAMENT WE STILL HAVEN'T GOT TO THE POSITION WHERE WE'VE GOT FIFTY FIFTY SO FOR ME IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ONE PERSON WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THEIR COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE OF PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE AND I'LL BE INTERESTED TO SEE HOW PRIME MINISTER'S MAZE CABINET LOOKS LIKE CHILE WERE LIVES THAT WILL BE A TEST WON'T IT IN THERE IS A SENSE THAT RATHER LIKE MARGARET THATCHER SHE WAS A WOMAN WHO MADE IT IN A MAN'S WORLD PLAYING ESSENTIALLY TO MEN'S RULES IS THAT FAIR
I THINK SHE'S A VERY I THINK SHE'S A STRONG ONE CLEAR WOMAN SHE'S A WOMAN WITH A VERY CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT SHE WANTS WHERE SHE'S GOING AND SHE HAS HAD THE COURAGE OVER THE YEARS THROUGH CRITICISE HER OWN PARTY WHEN SHE THINKS IT'S GOING WRONG AND HAVING SAID THAT HOWEVER THIS ISN'T JUST A BRITISH PHENOMENON IF YOU LOOK AT THE REST OF EUROPE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT IN AMERICA IF YOU LOOK AT AFRICA IN ALL THESE PARTS OF THE WORLD AND GOING TO ASSUME WOMEN MOVING FORWARD AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE AS I THINK WAS QUITE RIGHTLY SAID EARLIER
WE'RE SEEING A CULTURAL SHIFT WHERE WOMEN ARE BEGINNING TO BE ACCEPTED AS FULL CITIZENS LIKE I DO HAVE TO ADD MY WARNING NOTE ON THAT IS THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF THE WORLD LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MOST OF THE ARAB WORLD WHERE WOMEN STILL HAVE PUZZLE A VERY LONG WAY TO GO IN ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED AS HAVING AN EQUAL CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE TO MEN AND I HOPE YOU SEE THAT CHANGED BECAUSE ALL THE EVIDENCE FOR EXAMPLE NATIONS HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX SHOWS WHERE WOMEN ARE EXCLUDED OR LARGELY A SEGREGATED FROM THEM
THE SOCIETY'S DECISIONS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GET A LESS SUCCESSFUL APPROACH TO GOVERNING AND WHERE THEY ARE FULLY PART OF THE OTHER DECISION MAKING PROCESS MARIE MILLER BACK AT HOME WITHOUT REOPENING THE ROW THAT THERE WAS THIS WEEK
WOMEN GET INTO THE TOP YES BUT IT'S STILL QUITE COMMON FOR THOSE WOMEN TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN TO NOT BE MOTHERS DO YOU THINK THERE IS STILL A PROBLEM ABOUT COMBINING HIGH OFFICE WITHOUT TOUCHING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARENTHOOD I DON'T THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S UNIQUE TO POLITICS I THINK THAT'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND BOSS TREASON MEI MEI A SHATTERED ANOTHER LAYER OF THE GLASS CEILING
I THINK WOMEN LISTENING TO THIS INTERVIEW THIS MORNING WILL BE THINKING THAT THEY'RE A LOT MORE GLASS CEILINGS OUT THERE AROUND THE COUNTRY OFTEN LINKED SO THEY HATCH THEIR CHILD CARING RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEIR OUTER CARE RESPONSIBILITIES SO IT'S MODERNISING THE WORKPLACE NOT JUST IN PARLIAMENT BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY WHICH I THINK IS ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES OF THE MAKE UP AND
WHAT I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PARLIAMENT AS MARIA'S JUST SAID I WAS A LOCAL COUNCILLOR AND ONLY TWELVE PERCENT OF COUNCIL LEADERS ARE FEMALE AND EVEN AN COUNCIL YOU HAVE SUCH LONG HOURS WHICH ARE NOT REALLY CHILD FRIENDLY SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT LAYERS OF POLITICS IS NOT JUST ABOUT PARLIAMENT AT THE ASSEMBLY IT'S ABOUT LONDON MELTY AND ABOUT COUNCIL AND IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT GENUINELY REPRESENTATIVE AND WE DO NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS A CULTURE THAT'S MORE FRIENDLY FOR WOMEN
AND I THINK MEN TALK VERY SAD YES SURELY ARE MEN MARIA JELLY JELLY PERFECTLY LIT GO MET WHAT WARRIOR SELL I THINK IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN FORGOTTEN AND THE ARGUMENT ABOUT THERESA MAY NOT HAVING CHILDREN THAT MOST OF THE OUTSTANDING WOMEN POLITICIANS OF THE LAST COUPLE OF GENERATIONS HAVE BEEN WOMEN WHOM MAY HAVE BEEN MARRIED BUT DID NOT HAVE CHILDREN BARBARA CASTLE IS ONE EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MIND THERE ARE MANY MORE IT WAS QUITE
TYPICAL THAT EITHER WITH VARIOUS ALL WOMEN WITHOUT CHILDREN WERE THE ONES THAT TOOK UP THE SERIOUS POSITIONS IN POLITICS SO IT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT POINT ON CHILDREN ONLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT ON WHETHER THE BURDEN THAT MARIA'S TALKED ABOUT OF HAVING HUGE DOMESTIC RESPONSE RELIGIOUS AS WELL ONCE YOU DO HAVE CHILDREN MAKE IT QUITE DIFFICULT FOR A WOMAN TO REACH THE HIGHEST POINT PERFECT BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OF A WOMAN PRIME MINISTER IS BACKED UP BY MORE WOMEN IN PARLIAMENT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WHERE WE ARE CHANGING THE AGENDA AS WELL
WHEN I FIRST JOINED PARLIAMENT FLEXIBLE WORKING WAS NOT ON THE AGENDA IT WOULDN'T BE TALKED ABOUT BY PETER MANDELSON NOW IT'S FIRMLY CENTRE STAGE BERNICE WILLIAMS I DON'T WANT TO LET YOU GO WITHOUT ASKING YOUR ADVICE AND A RATHER IMPORTANT SUBJECT AT THE MOMENT WOULD BE SENSIBLE TO SET UP A NEW CENTRE PARTY YOU TRIED A WHILE AGO THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN PARTY YOU SAY THE LIB DEMS ARE NOW A TARNISHED BRANDS PLENTY OF PEOPLE ON THE LABOUR PARTY THINKING OF DOING IT WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE
I DON'T THINK LIB DEMS I THOMAS BRAND BUT STILL LET ME SAY RIGHT AWAY AS WITH WELL I DON'T I DON'T SEE BUM I THINK THOSE WERE THE WORDS OF TIM FARRON YOUR LEADER
WELL HE'S I THINK HE'S THINKING ABOUT A LONG TIME BACK BUT ANYWAY THERE WE ARE LET ME SAY RIGHT AWAY THAT I THINK THERE IS A CASE FOR NOT A POT SENT A PARTY BECAUSE THEY'RE ARE REALLY QUITE DEEP DIVISIONS NOT LEAST ON THINGS LIKE CIVIL LIBERTIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTIES BUT I THINK WELL THERE IS ROOM FOR AND WE OUGHT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IS A LINK BETWEEN PARTIES AND PARTICULAR SUBJECT AREAS FOR EXAMPLE I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESS IN BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER THAT WE HAD BOTH PEOPLE WHO WERE IN FAVOUR AND AGAINST
EXIT SITTING ON COMMITTEES ARE LOOKING INTO THE WHOLE ISSUE OF HOW WE NEGOTIATE AN OUTCOME THIS AND THERE'S ABLE TO LIVE WITH BY BOTH PROS MANTIS THE VOTE WAS VERY CLOSE IT'S NO GOOD TRYING TO
THEN A BULLY ONE SIDE BY THE POWER OF THE OTHER I THINK WE ACTUALLY GOT TO HAVE THEY COMMITTEE AT ALL PARTIES SITTING TO DISCUSS WITH THE GOVERNMENT ISSUE OF HARRIER NEGOTIATOR NOW ISN'T ANONYMOUS I'M FREE OTHER S.D.P. NO I DON'T THINK SO SHIRLEY WILLIAMS BARONESS WILLIAMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARIA MILLER AND TULIPS AND HE THINKS
# ANDREW AND I IF THERE IS ONE THING ALL PRIME MINISTERS HAVE IN COMMON IT IS THAT THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR LEGACY WHAT VERDICT WILL HISTORY PASS ON THEM SOMETIMES IT'S CLEAR CHURCHILL WON THE WAR THAT THEY GAVE US THE WELFARE STATE AND SO ON SOMETIMES PRIME MINISTERS COME AND GO AND HISTORY BARELY NOTICES IF AT ALL AND DAVID CAMERON WELL LET US DISCUSS HIS LEGACY OR LACK OF IT WITH POLLEN MACKENZIE WHO WAS LIBERAL DEMOCRAT POLICY ADVISER AT NUMBER TEN DURING THE COALITION
FRANCIS MAUDE LORD MAUDE WHO WAS TORY PARTY CHAIRMAN CABINET MINISTER AND SIR ANTHONY SELDON POLITICAL HISTORIAN WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT DAVID CAMERON'S TIME AT NUMBER TEN SO LET'S START WITH YOU SIR ANTHONY LET'S ASSUME FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS DISCUSSION THAT WE WILL ALL AGREE THAT HE WILL BE DEFINED BY THE REFERENDUM BUT IN WHAT WAY
MONEY TO GO TO DEVELOPMENT AND MODERNISED TO PARTY AT YES IT ENDED IN A DISASTER PARTLY FOR HIM HE WAS
FOR MANY YEARS THESE ARE HISTORICAL ACHIEVEMENTS AND YES THE REFERENDUM WENT AGAINST HIM I THINK THE VERDICT OF HISTORY WILL BE PARTLY WEATHER BRITAIN AND THE HOUSE IS THIS A DIVIDED NATION IS SHIRLEY WILLIAMS PLAYING WITH A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH MANY MORE
O.K. SO THAT SO THAT IS YET TO BE SETTLED POLLY MCKENZIE SHOW SIR ANTHONY MENTION THE COALITION AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT PART OF HIS LEGACY YEAH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN DAVID CAMERON IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN MADE THAT BIG OPEN GENEROUS OFFER AND BECAME THE LEADER OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT AND I THINK IN THAT DECISION THERE WAS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO BE THE PRIME MINISTER THAT IN A WAY ANTHONY HAS JUST DESCRIBED A REFORMING CENTRIST AMBITIOUS AND AN HISTORIC FIGURE
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF WHAT I SEE AS HIS PRIMARY WITNESS WHICH IS A TENDENCY TO OVER PROMISE TO GET THROUGH SHORT TERM DIFFICULTY WE DON'T ALL DO A BIT OF THAT OH YEAH AND THE LIB DEMS HAVE DONE IT TOO PROMISING THINGS WERE IMPOSSIBLE BUT I THINK DAVID CAMERON SYSTEMATICALLY PROMISED THINGS THAT WERE IMPOSSIBLE ON IMMIGRATION IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO ONE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND THEN ON REFORMING THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND AS A RESULT CREATED THIS GREAT SORT OF CARBUNCLE OF THE DISASTER WHICH WILL COMPLETELY DISGUISE ANY MORE MORE SORT OF DEEP UNDERSTANDING OR RECOGNITION OF HIT OF HIS WIDER REFORMS RIGHT FRANCE'S MORE DEER AS FAR AS THE REFERENDUM GOES ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT THE ANTI SELDON SAID THE TRUE ABOUT THE VOTE TONY BLAIR OF HER BUT THAT'S THE POINT FREUDIAN SLIP THERE ABOUT DAVID CANNON BECAUSE
TONY BLAIR DID ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IN THE END HE'S GOING TO BE DEFINED BY THE RECORD NOW WELL I THAT IS INEVITABLY GOING TO BE THE SORT OF THE EASY THING FOR PEOPLE TO SAY I THINK THEY'VE BEEN THREE PHASES IN DAVID CAMERON'S CAREER AT THE TOP OF POLITICS AS PARTY LEADER IN OPPOSITION AS HEAD OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT AND THEN THIS LAST YEAR MORE THAN A YEAR AS HEAD OF HER MA'AM MAJORITY GOVERNMENT
AND I THINK HE WILL LOOK BACK AND OTHERS WILL LOOK BACK AND SEE THAT LAST PHASERS OBVIOUSLY THE LEAST SUCCESSFUL AND IT WOULD BE A VERY GREAT PITY IF ATTENTION WERE TO BE DISTRACTED FROM THE AMAZING ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIRST OF THE JUST ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE WOULD JUST ABOUT TALK WE JUST COME OUT OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE ROLE OF WOMEN AND PART OF THE TOP OF POLITICS
ACTUALLY THERESA MAY AND DAVID CAMERON WERE VERY EARLY IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANY WOMEN WE DIDN'T AND HE ABSOLUTELY RECOGNISED THAT THAT WAS A PROBLEM AND WE MADE SOME WE TOOK SOME VERY IMPORTANT STEPS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN TORY M.P.S WITHOUT RESORTING TO ALL WOMEN SHORTLISTS WHICH LABOUR HAVE DONE AND THAT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT I MEAN MOVING THE CONSERVATIVE
PARTY TO MAKE IT MUCH MORE CONTEMPORARY MUCH MORE IN TOUCH WITH BRITAIN ABLE TO REPRESENT BRITAIN AS IT IS TODAY THAT WAS A HUGE ACHIEVEMENT AND IT REQUIRED REAL LEADERSHIP AND HE GAVE THE PARTY AT THAT REAL LEADERSHIP FOR FOUR AND A HALF I DON'T KNOW WHAT OF THE SORTS OF AND THEN I THOUGHT BUT I THINK I THINK T'NORTH SEGUE INTO THE ROLE AS HEAD OF THE LEADER OF THE COALITION GOVERNMENT THE FACT THAT HE HAD DONE THAT MEANT THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WAS WHICH IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SOME YEARS BEFORE
AN ACCEPTABLE PARTNER FOR THE LIB DEMS IN A COALITION GOVERNMENT AND THAT ENABLED HIM TO BRING TOGETHER AND IT WAS VERY MUCH UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP A COALITION GOVERNMENT AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS IN DEEP CRISIS AND NEEDED A STRONG AND BROAD BASED GOVERNMENT TO TACKLE THE PROBLEMS OF THE DEFICIT AND THE FINANCIAL CRASH AND I THINK THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD HAVE DONE THAT AND I THINK I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE
THE DEFINING FEATURE OF HIS REALLY LOGICAL KARA BUT I THINK FRANCES IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ABOUT WHAT DAVID CAMERON DID TO THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN OPPOSITION BUT ONCE HE CAME IN TO TO GOVERNMENT HE BASICALLY GAVE UP ON THAT PROJECT AND I DID WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GAY MARRIAGE THE CHALLENGERS TO THE PARTY SO OFTEN STOPPED AND IN A WAY THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS BECAME A SORT OF AN EXCUSE IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DOING THE HARD WORK WITH THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY I DON'T AGREE RIGHT WELL LET'S LET'S COME IN ON THAT HE'S ALMOST INDEPENDENT ARBITER
I AGREED WITH EVERYTHING WITH HOLLYWOOD STAYING UP TO THAT POINT IT WAS
I'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT YOU KNOW
THEN ADD EXACTLY AND WE REMEMBER EVEN THE SEWERS REMEMBER TONY BLAIR FOR IRAQ AT LEAST I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND WE'RE GOING TO REMEMBER
I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO WHERE WE BEGAN WE'RE GOING TO REMEMBER DAVID CAMERON FOR THE REFERENDUM THAT TOOK US OUT OF EUROPE THAT IS THE CASE ISN'T IT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE AND IN A WAY I
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS I THINK IT WAS A WEAKNESS IN HER REFUSAL TO CHALLENGE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO TIP TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THEIR DEMANDS FOR A REFERENDUM HE PROMISED THEM THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD WIN IT AND IT'S THAT ARROGANCE AND COMPLACENCY WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN DAVID CAMERON STAND FOR AND THAT IS A PROBLEM HAS ADVANCED MORE THAT HE WILL BE SEEN AS SOMEBODY WHO MADE A COLOSSAL MISJUDGMENT FOR THE WORST REASONS REALLY I DON'T THINK IT WAS FOR THE WORST REASONS
NOR DO I THINK IT WAS NECESSARILY MUCH AS I THINK THEY WERE AN ANCHOR THEM IN THE LIBRARY PART I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KIND OF UNFORCED ERRORS ALONG THE WAY AND I DON'T THINK THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WAS PARTICULARLY EDIFYING FROM EITHER SIDE AND I REMAINED ON THE CLOUD THROUGHOUT MY THOUGHT THE ARGUMENTS WERE MUCH MORE FINELY BALANCED THEM EITHER SIDE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED AS INDEED THE NATION SEEMS COLLECTIVELY TO HAVE DONE TO FIND THE BALANCE THE I'LL GO AND FIND YOUR BALANCE BOTH SIDES MADE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS ON THE ONE SIDE ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF US ALL IT THAT ANSWER
ABSOLUTELY HE BUT HE'S THE KINDA GUY WHO WILL NOT EVER TRIED TO RIZAL FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT HE'S TAKEN THE RESPONSIBILITY AND HE KNOWS THAT THIS WILL BE
ONE OF THE THE PRINCIPAL DEFINING THING OF HIS PREMIERSHIP AND I THINK THAT SAD BECAUSE HE'S ACHIEVED SUCH A LOT I THINK HE'S BEEN A GOOD INFLUENCE ON OUR POLITICS YOU'VE GOT TEN SECONDS EACH ON THEIR SUCCESS OR FAILURE AS A PRIME MINISTER SINCE YOU'RE TALKING FOR US I THINK DEFINITELY SUCCESS LEADING THE COALITION GOVERNMENT SUCCESSFULLY AND GETTING BRITAIN OUT OF A HELLUVA MESS HOLLY FAILURE GRASP FROM THE JAWS OF SUCCESS TO ANTHONY
POLLY MCKENZIE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THAT'S ALL FROM US IT WILL SOON BE ALL FROM HIM AS WELL OUR EDITORS TODAY LAURA COOPER AND JOEL MORTALS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
