BUILDING GREAT DO CRISTIANO RONALDO WHO'D TRIED AS HE WAS STRETCHERED OFF JUST AS HE HAD TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN THE TEAM FELL AT THE LAST HURDLE WAS BY NOW CRYING TEARS OF JOY
AFTER ALL THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC PAIN AND TRAUMA OF RECENT YEARS INCLUDING A EUROZONE BAILOUT SOME FANS FOUND TIME TO PHILOSOPHISE IT'S NOT ONLY A MILE FROM THE FOOTBALL FOR OLIVE
WE MUST LEAVE OURSELF PUB SOMETIME YOU COULD BUY
DUNDEE FINE WIDDLED UPON
JUST NEED TO BE ASKED HEALTH PORTUGAL'S PRESIDENT A BALLARD WHO ATTENDED THE MATCH IN PARIS ALONG WITH THE PRIME MINISTER WAS ALSO QUICK TO DRAW BROADER LESSONS GET HIM NOT TO DO IT UP AND I SAID WE WERE EUROPE'S BEST WE DRESSED WE SUFFERED A LOT BUT WE SHOWED WHAT WE ASK TOUGH ONLY UNITED
ABLE TO DO ANYTHING WITH PORTUGAL AT ITS BEST SO WE GOT UP FOR NOW THOUGH IT'S ALL ABOUT CELEBRATION BACK IN LISBON AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE THE HEAD OF STATE IS THIS AFTERNOON TO RECEIVE THE SQUAD AND DECORATE THEM FOR THEIR UNIQUE ACHIEVEMENT ALISON ROBERTS REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND IT IS THE START OF THE FARNBOROUGH AIR SHOW THIS MORNING WHICH MEANS LOTS OF AEROPLANES OF COURSE MAY BE LOTS OF BUSINESS DEALS AS WELL WHICH IS WHY DOMENICO CORAL IS THIS MORNING MORNING DOMINIC
# GOOD MORNING JOHN FROM FARNBOROUGH AIRPORT AND HAMPSHIRE WHERE THE FAMOUS HERE SHOW IS ABOUT TO GET UNDERWAY SO QUIET AT THE MOMENT A BIT OF PALE SUN PEERING INTO THE RANKS OF PARKED AIRCRAFT IN FRONT OF ME BUT THEY DID TODAY'S HE SAID IT WILL BE VERY NOISY THE SKY WILL BE FILLED WITH DEAFENING ROAR OF JIT'S FARM HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PLACE WITH THE LATEST AIRCRAFT ARE SEEN BY THE PUBLIC FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN FIFTY FOUR YEARS AGO THE STAR OF THE SHOW WAS A VERY BRITISH TECHNICAL TRIUMPH
I'VE GOT A NINETEEN SIXTY TWO BUT PLENTY BAD FLYING THIS PLANE AN EXHIBITION WOULD BE A PRETTY
OUR PUPPY POWER BY A BETTER PART OF HER BOTH ENDED THE BABY'S BROTHER NEIGHBOURLY HUNTER DEMONSTRATED HIGH RATE OF CLIMB
THAT OF COURSE WAS THE HARRIER JUMP JET WHICH WE'RE NOT TO BECOME A REAL WORKHORSE FOR THE ROYAL AIR FORCE AND THE ROYAL NAVY THIS YEAR'S STAR WILL BE ANOTHER JUMP
THAT WAS THE F. THIRTY FIVE THE AIR FORCE'S BUYING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY OF THEM IN A SENSE IT'S A REPLACEMENT FOR THE HARRIER BUT ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE A DIFFERENT PIECE TO START OFF WITH SOME AMERICAN NOT A BRITISH PLANE MADE BY LOCKHEED MARTIN AND ALSO IT IS BY SOME DISTANCE THE BIGGEST MILITARY AIRCRAFT PROGRAM EVER EMERSON AMERICA THINK THEY'RE OVER THERE THIRTY YEARS OR SO IT'S IN SERVICE IF THIRTY FIVE PROJECT WILL BE WORTH IN TOTAL SOME ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS A TRILLION DOLLARS
JUST AS WELL SOME BRITISH COMPANIES HAVE GOT A BIG SHARE OF THE WORK ROLLS ROYCE HAS HELPED BUILD THE SYSTEM THERE LET'S TAKE OFF AND LAND VERTICALLY THAT THE JUMPING BIT OF THE JUMP SHIP AND B.A.E. SYSTEMS ARE BRITISH DEFENCE CONTRACTOR HAS A FIFTEEN PERCENT SHARE OVER ALL OF THE PROGRAMME I ASKED IAN KING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF B.A.E. SYSTEMS HOW IMPORTANT THE F. THIRTY FIVE BALLS TO THE BRITISH DEFENCE INDUSTRY
IT'S FANTASTIC THAT THE COMPANY IS ON BOTH THOSE TWO PRE EMINENT COMBAT AIRCRAFT PROGRAMMES AT THE SAME TIME A TYPHOON IN THERE THIRTY FIVE WE HAVE A FIFTEEN PERCENT WORK SHARE AND WE CONTRIBUTE THROUGH A TEN PER CENT FROM THE U.K. THE FUSELAGE VERY HIGH END MANUFACTURING
A FIVE PERCENT THROUGH THE U.S. WITH THE ELECTRONIC WARFARE AND THROUGH A CONTRIBUTION AUSTRALIA SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMME TO THIS COME ON WHAT'S WHAT'S THE VALUE TO THE COMPANY OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS MALE WILL BECOME A SECOND LARGEST PROGRAMME BUT AT THE END OVAL IN ABOUT THREE YEARS' TIME I THINK PEOPLE FORGET IS THAT WE'RE STILL RAMPING UP MANUFACTURING SO WE'RE ABOUT SIXTY SETS
A YEAR AND WILL GO TO ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SETS A YEAR BY TWENTY TWENTY SO IT'S A FANTASTIC SORT OF PROGRAMMED TO BE ON IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TENS OF BILLIONS OF POUNDS OH YES ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY
WITH ME NOW IS THE MAN IN THE HOT SEAT THE MAN HAS TO FLY THE PLANE DURING THE SHOW PETE WILSON THE B.A.E. SYSTEMS TEST PILOT PETE PEOPLE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE HERRIOT'S A BIT OF A BIT OF A BRITISH ICON HOW DOES IT COMPARE WITH WHAT YOU'RE FLYING TODAY THE F. THIRTY FIVE QUITE A DIFFERENT THING
YES MORNING DOMINATE THEIR HARRIER WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IN ITS TIME BUT IT'S NOW FIFTY YEARS ON AS YOU SAY AND WE'VE DEVELOPED THE AEROPLANE FROM ITS HUMBLE BEGINNINGS INTO A PHENOMENAL EXPEDITIONARY CAPABILITY WE FITTED RADARS WE FITTED WHERE MISSILES AND THE AIRPLANE AS GONE PROVEN ITSELF IN COMBAT MANY MANY TIMES INDEED IT IS STILL IN SERVICE TODAY
WITH THE U.S. ARMED FORCES BUT THE THE F. THIRTY FIVE IS BORN OUT OF A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IDEA SO WHY YOU MIGHT LOOK AT IT AND SEE ANOTHER AEROPLANE THAT HOVERS IN THAT SENSE YOU THINK THAT IT IS A DIRECT DESCENDANT IT'S REALLY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IDEA I THINK THE COMMONALITY THAT I WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT IT'S THE ABILITY TO TAKE THE AEROPLANE TO AN EXPEDITIONARY PLACE TOO AUSTERE PSYCHO AND OPERATE OUT OF THE DESERT OR PERHAPS KEY TO THE U.K. AS OPERATE OFF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER
AND FOR THAT SENSE WE'RE BUILDING A COUPLE OF NEW F. THIRTY FIVE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS WHO COME INTO SERVICE AND WE JUST COPY THAT'S A GOOD POINT WE SHOULD REMEMBER THIS PLANE AS DISTANT FOR THE TWO NEW ROYAL NAVY AIRCRAFT CARRIERS ISN'T IT CORRECT AND UNIQUELY THE U.K.'S IN A BEAUTIFUL POSITION WE'RE SPENDING A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT WE ARE PUTTING A CARRIER IN THE WATER AND AN AIRCRAFT IN THE AIR CON OR SIDE BY SIDE AND THE U.K.'S IN THIS VERY BEAUTIFUL POSITION OF DEVELOPING THESE TWO THINGS TO TO WORK TOGETHER
ONE MORE GENERAL QUESTION PETE YOU'RE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FOR ME WE YOU CAN'T THUMP ME ISN'T IT IS IT IS IT TRUE THAT THE TEST PILOT SITE YOU ACTUALLY A BIT OF A DYING BREED THAT THE MIX THE F. THIRTY FIVE WILL BE THE LAST OF THESE MEN
AND ACTUALLY FUTURE IS ALL ABOUT DRONES BEING FLOWN FROM COMPUTERS NO I THINK THE FUTURE IS A MIXED FUTURE I THINK FOR SURE THEY'RE GOING TO BE UNMANNED ELEMENTS TO TO WHAT WE OPERATE IN THE WAY BEAR SYSTEMS BUT THE MAN IN THE AIR IS AN IMPORTANT DECISION MAKER HE TAKES IN INFORMATION HE ASSESSES HE CAN DEVELOP HIS THOUGHT PROCESSES HIS SITUATIONAL AWARENESS ONE WHEN HE'S IN THE FIGHT EMBEDDED IN IT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM BEING REMOTE FROM IT SO I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE
FOR SURE I CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER THEY WILL BE ANOTHER MANNED FIGHTER PROJECT BUT MY BELIEF HONESTLY IS THAT THERE WILL BE THANK YOU VERY MUCH PEOPLE PETER AND THE OTHER PILOTS WILL BE TRYING TO IMPRESS THE CROWDS BELOW WITH THE DISPLAYS THE FLIGHTS ARE ALSO ABOUT SOMETHING THE PLANES AND THAT'S THE SECRET OF FARM BUT THERE ARE TWO FARMERS THE ONE THE PUBLIC SEES THE AIR DISPLAY MINISTER HIDDEN ONE THE DEALS ARE DONE ON THE COMPANY
BEHIND ME WHEN I SAY SHADOWS EXIT THE MORE LIKE MINI OFFICE BLOCKS WITH MEETING ROOMS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL VINNIE'S FOR WINING AND DINING AIRLINE BOSSES IN THE FITS JUICE I ASKED THE INKING AGIN THE CHIEF EXEC OF B.A.E. SYSTEMS JUST HOW IMPORTANT FABER WAS
OH I THINK IT'S MASSIVELY IMPORTANT TO BRITISH INDUSTRY AND SPECIFICALLY WHERE WE ARE IN THE WORLD AT THIS STAGE TO SAY THAT WE ARE STILL COMMITTED TO DEFENCE AND SECURITY SO IT'S A GREAT SORT OF OPPORTUNITY TO POSTMARK THE CAPABILITIES THAT WE HAVE BOTH IN TERMS OF CUSTOMER CAPABILITIES AND THE DISTANT DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH CAPABILITIES IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET PEOPLE OR COALESCES PEOPLE IN AND WE GET GREAT SUPPORT YOU FOR YOU KAY'S GOING TO STAY OPEN FOR BUSINESS THIS IS THE FOOTPRINT FOR THAT
WITH ME IS THE MAN WHO HAS TO ORGANISE FARMER PAUL EVERITT HE'S A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF A. D. S. THE SPACE AND DEFENCE TRADE ASSOCIATION PAUL A FEW YEARS AGO FOR PERHAPS TEN YEARS AGO THE IDEA WAS THAT FARMER AND SHOWS LIKE IT WERE ON THE WAY OUT THERE THESE FLYING DISPLAYS ARE A BIT OUTDATED BUT FOUND SEEMS TO IT SEEMS TO ME HE'S HAD A BIT OF A NEW LEASE OF LIFE
WELL THAT'S GOOD WE CERTAINLY THINK SO AND I THINK THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS TO THE FIRST IS THAT WE'VE EMBRACED THE MOST INTERNATIONAL OF GLOBAL AIR SHOWS SEVENTY ONE PER CENT OF THE EXHIBITORS HERE ARE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.K.
HUGE NUMBERS OF SENIOR POLITICIANS FROM AROUND THE WORLD WILL BE HERE THIS WEEK BUT HE'S TRYING TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO COME TO THEIR COUNTRY AND INVEST BUT ALSO SOME DEALS AROUND THE PLACE BUT ALSO THE SECOND THEME IS WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SITE TO IMPROVE IT TO BRING UP BRING IT UP TO THE KINDS OF STANDARDS YOU WOULD FIND AT THEIR VERY BEST
THIS YEAR WHEN WE TAKE DOWN ONE OF THE PERMANENT STRUCTURES WILL BE BUILDING A NEW PERMANENT EXHIBITION AND CONFERENCE CENTRE
WHICH FOR US IS THE NEXT STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SHOW AND OF THE SITE TO ENSURE THAT WE DO REMAIN THE PLACE WHERE THE GLOBAL AEROSPACE AND AVIATION INDUSTRY COMES IT'S ALL ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION ISN'T IT FOR YOUR MEMBERS THE BRICKS IT VOTE MUST HAVE BEEN A BIG THING BUT A LOT OF THE PLANES WE SEE HERE ARE THE RESULT OF INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS AIRBUS OF COURSE BECAUSE IT IS ALL ABOUT EUROPEAN PARTNERSHIP THIS LITTLE BIT OF US A STEP BACKWARDS FOR YOUR MEMBERS
BUT BRITAIN WILL BE LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK WE WERE VERY CLEAR THAT WE AS AN INDUSTRY WE CERTAINLY WANT TO THE U.K. TO REMAIN PART OF THE E.U. CLEARLY THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES DON'T NOW WE'VE MADE THAT DECISION I THINK IS AN INDUSTRY WE MEET THOSE CHALLENGES HIM PRETTY GOOD
HEART LAST HE WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR FOR US THE CIVIL AEROSPACE BUSINESS IS GROWING SIX AND A HALF PER CENT LAST YEAR WERE EMPLOYING MORE PEOPLE WERE TAKING ON MORE APPRENTICES SO I THINK WE'RE WELL SET FOR THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES WELL BEYOND EUROPE I MEAN DAVID CAMERON'S GOING TO BE HERE LATER TODAY HE SIGNING TO BIG MULTI MILLION BILLION POUND DEALS BOTH WITH BOEING IN AMERICAN COMPANY ONE FOR MARITIME RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT THE OTHER ONE FOR AN UPGRADE OF THE APACHE HELICOPTER
# THE U.K. HAS A LONG TRADITION OF TRADING WILL BE ON THE EUROPEAN UNION ABSOLUTELY WE ARE A GLOBAL BUSINESS WE'VE GOT THE BIGGEST CONTINGENT FROM THE U.S. AND INDEED FROM AFRICA AND CHINA HERE AT THE SHOW AND CLEARLY THE MIDDLE EAST AS WELL A R. E. ARE IMPORTANT
PLAYERS HERE BUT ALSO INPUT IMPORTANT MARKETS FOR US AS AS AN INDUSTRY SO I THINK WE'RE WELL SET TO KIND OF EMBRACE THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE I THINK THE REAL CHALLENGE IS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT PERHAPS TWO YEARS ENSURING THAT THE INEVITABLE UNCERTAINTY THAT COMES WITH THE DECISION DOES NOT PREVENT COMPANIES INVESTING HERE IN THE U.K.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH PAUL NEVER HAVE PAID THE EARS NOW TO DISCUSS THE OTHER BUSINESS USE ON JOINT FROM THE STUDIO BY RAMA KRISHNA AND THE GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGISTS AT J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND A BIG WEEK FOR US LOOKING FORWARD TO THURSDAY WE HAVE A MEETING OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S INTEREST RATE SITTING COMMITTEE B. M. P. C. AND MOST PEOPLE EXPECT IT TO BE A CUTTING INTEREST RATES DON'T THEY
YES GIVE HIM THE GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION AROUND THE U.K.'S ECONOMIES FUTURE PROSPECTS AS WELL AS WHERE THE REFERENDUM RESULTS WILL ALL TAKE THE U.K. ECONOMY FORWARD WE DO HAVE A LARGE EXPECTATION FOR MOST ECONOMISTS AND MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THERE WILL BE A RAKE HURT EITHER THIS WEEK OR SOMETIME IN THE NEXT FUTURE AND THEY'D REMEMBER WORD ALREADY A VERY LOW LEVEL FOR THE U.K.'S ECONOMIC HISTORY IT'S IT'S WORKED FOR HIM FOR SEVEN YEARS WE'VE HAD THE LOWEST INTEREST RATES HALF A PER CENT
COULD GO DOWN TO BUY A POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT GOING TO QUARTER OF PER CENT OR MAYBE EVEN TO ZERO DO YOU THINK IT COULD BE I DO THINK THERE'S A BIT OF HESITATION FROM A LOT OF CENTRAL BANKERS MARCONI OTHER BANK OF ENGLAND INCLUDED THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAST TOO QUICKLY TOO NEGATIVE
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT ARE STILL UNKNOWN WE'VE SEEN IN THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK BANK OF JAPAN GOING NEGATIVE BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME HESITATION FROM MARCONI AND THE COMMITTEE THERE YOU GO A BIT SLOWER BEFORE GETTING INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY
JUST QUICKLY CLIPPING THE BIT THERESA MAY THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADERSHIP HOPEFUL IS MAKING A SPEECH TO HIM WHICH HE'S GOING TO ASK THAT TO TALK ABOUT TO BIG CHANGES IN COMPANY LAW A BINDING VOTE ON CORPORATE PAY
AND WORK REPRESENTATION ON BOARDS THERE'S PROBABLY WORTH POINTING OUT ON THAT LAST POINT IT WOULD REQUIRE A BIG CHANGE IN THE LAW TO BRING THAT ABOUT WOULDN'T IT YES THE WORK REPRESENTATIONS ON BOARD IS AN INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THE U.K.'S DONE FOR EXAMPLE OTHER COUNTRIES DENMARK GERMANY AND SWEDEN ARE FURTHER ALONG IN THAT SPECTRUM WITH THAT MY REPRESENTATION AND YOU'D THINK THAT
ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF THAT HIS EMPLOYEES OF A COMPANY NO BEST PERHAPS WHAT IS NEEDED ON THE GROUND YOU SEEN LARGER AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE A LONG TERM INVESTMENT IN COUNTRIES AND COMPANIES THAT DO HAVE LARGER WRECKER REPRESENTATION AND US THAT MIGHT BE A BIG CHANGE FOR U.K. COMPANIES TO TAKE WHAT THE EMPLOYEES
I NEED A BETTER ACTIVITIES OR FUTURE INVESTMENTS INTO A COMPANY MAKING THE DECISION MAKING
IT WOULD INDEED BE A BIG CHANGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AROUND THE KRISHNA FROM J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGER

# RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE RESPONDED TO THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGED BY RAISING PRICES OR REDUCING PROFITS RATHER THAN CUTTING JOBS THE ONLY RATE OF SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY WAS INTRODUCED IN APRIL THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT BY THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION WHICH QUESTION FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES THE THINK TANK HAS ALSO WARNED THAT THE U.K.'S DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. COULD AFFECT THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW WAGE POLICY
# HUNDREDS OF SOUTHERN RAILWAY SERVICES HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY DROPPED IN AND AMENDED TIMETABLE HIM RESPONSE MONTHS OF DESTROY A DISRUPTION BECAUSE UM AN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE ACTION BY A N.T. MEMBERS AND HIGH LEVELS OF STAFF SICKNESS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO CANCELLATIONS ON SOUTHERN SERVICES FROM THE SOUTH COAST TO LONDON THE COMPANY HOPES THE TIMETABLE WILL OFFER MORE CERTAINTY FOR PASSENGERS ANGRY COMMUTERS ARE HOLDING A PROTEST AT VICTORIA STATION
# AND THE COALITION GOVERNMENT IN JAPAN LED BY SHINTO ABBEY HAS WON A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY IN THE UPPER HOUSE IT GIVES MY HOBBY THE OPTION TO TRY TO REVISE JAPAN'S PACIFIST CONSTITUTION
# IT IS NOW TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN ANGELA EAGLE IS MAKING HER PITCH FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LABOUR PARTY TODAY IT'S A STRANGE CONTEST IN THAT'S A BIT OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT NORMAN SMITH ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR STRANGE NORMAN BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY GOT A LEADER AND HIS NAME HE'S CALLED IN HE SAYS HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE
IT'S STRANGE IN SO MANY WAYS JOHN I MEAN I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S ITS UNIQUE REALLY I CAN'T RECALL A LABOUR LEADER BEING CHALLENGED SO SOON AFTER BEING ELECTED WHAT JUST TOUCH TEN MONTHS AGO AND THIS FROM A PARTY WHICH TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SOPPY AND SQUEAMISH ABOUT GETTING RID OF LEADERS NOW VAST CHUNKS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY ARE RUNNING AROUND LIKE MAD AXEMAN DETERMINED
TO OUST JEREMY CORBIN AND STRANGE IN THE SENSE TO HIM THAT IT AS FAR AS I CAN SEE HE'S NOTHING REALLY TO DO ABOUT POLICY YOUR BIG ISSUES OF THE DAY OR JEREMY CORBIN STANCE ON TRIDENT OR WHATEVER IT IS ALL TO DO ABOUT THE MAN IT IS ABOUT GETTING RID OF JEREMY CORBIN BECAUSE OF A CONVICTION AMONGST MANY LABOUR M.P.S THAT
HE POSES A FUNDAMENTAL THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF THE LABOUR PARTY AS A VIABLE PARLIAMENTARY ORGANISATION AND THEREFORE AS A POTENTIAL FUTURE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY TAKE THE VIEW THAT HE SEES THE LABOUR PARTY HAVE SOME BROADER EXTRA PARLIAMENTARY FORCE TO WHICH HIS PARLIAMENTARY ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST BOLTED ON AND THEN OFF FOR THAT REASON THEY ARE UTTERLY AND TOTALLY DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM COME WHAT MAY AND IF THAT MEANS SHE DOESN'T GET ON THE BALLOT I MEAN I SUSPECT MANY PEOPLE THAT WOULD SEEM
SLIGHTLY EXTRAORDINARY THAT ARE SITTING LEADER WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DEFEND HIS POSITION OR WHATEVER'S BEEN ELECTED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY THEY ARE QUITE PREPARED FOR THAT AND IF THAT MEANS ALSO JEREMY CORBIN TAKING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST HIS OWN PARTY AGAIN ANOTHER UTTERLY EXTRAORDINARY CONCEPT THEY ARE PREPARED AS IT WERE TO SEE HIM IN HIGH COURT BECAUSE THEIR VIEW IS THAT HE MUST GO COME WHAT MAY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT ANGELA EAGLE I MEAN SHE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT
POLICY DIFFERENCES WITH JOEY GOT IN FACT I SUSPECT SHE'S PROBABLY GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH HIM THAN SHE HAS WITH THE OLD BLAIRITE RUMP IN THE PARTY AND SHE IS AN ANTI AUSTERITY CANDIDATE JUST LIKE JEREMY CORBIN YES THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCES OVER TRIDENT AND IRAQ BUT THIS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT ABOUT IDEOLOGY OR ABOUT ABOUT POLITICS IT IS ENTIRELY ABOUT PERSONALITY AND ONE PERSON JEREMY CORBIN AND IT'S GOOD AT THE PARTY APART IS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS
I THINK IT WILL BE UNIQUE TO IN THE BRUTALITY OF THE CONTEST BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD WE'VE ALREADY SEEN TOM WATSON DESPERATELY TRYING TO BROKER SOME SO HE'D GET ON AT THE END HE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO FIND ANY COMMON GROUND SO MUCH SO THAT A SORT OF DIVIDE NOW APPEARS TO HAVE OPENED UP BETWEEN LEN MCCLUSKEY AND TOM WATSON AND YOU WONDER HOW THE MASS OF THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP ARE GOING TO RESPOND IF THEY SEE THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY
LAUNCHING THIS UNRESTRAINED MOVED TO GET RID OF THE MAN WHO YOU KNOW MOST OF THEM OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED FOR ONE OTHER THING JOHN WHICH I FOUND STRIKING WHEN I WAS TALKING TO PEOPLE LAST NIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LOSE BECAUSE THEY COULD WELL LOSE OF JEREMY CORBIN GETS ON THE BALLET AND I WAS TOLD WELL THERE'LL BE OTHER LEADERSHIP CONTEST SO COME WHAT MAY THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING AND GOING AND GOING UNTIL THEY GET RID OF HIM NO ONE THANKS A LOT
# IT'S NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN NEARLY FIFTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN BATON ROUGE ON THE SIXTH NIGHT OF PROTESTS ABOUT THE KILLING OF BLACK MEN BY POLICE THE B.B.C.'S U.S. CORRESPONDENT LAURA BECAUSE IN BAT ROUGE AND I ASKED HER FOR THE LATEST
YES THOSE IN PROTESTERS MARCHED THROUGH WHAT IS A VERY IMPOSING STATE CAPITOL BUILDING AND STOOD ON THE STEPS THEY'VE DONE THIS ALMOST DAILY SINCE OPEN STIRLING WAS KILLED LAST WEEK AND THEN A NUMBER OF PROTESTERS HAD THE IDEA TO BLOCK A HIGHWAY AND AS THEY DID SO POLICE BLOCKED THE WAY THE POLICE HERE IN BATTER ROOS HAVE BEEN TAKING A VERY DELIBERATE APPROACH THEY HAVE BEEN USING LARGE NUMBERS AND THEY ARE ARE THEY
ASKS AND RIOT GEAR AND THERE'S A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF THEM THAT TRIED TO KIND OF LIGHTING UP AGAINST PROTESTERS THERE IS AN IMAGE WHICH I'M SURE WILL COME TO REPRESENT THIS WEEK WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN IN BATTLE AND IT'S THAT LINE OF WHITE POLICE OFFICERS IN RIOT GEAR
ONE SOLITARY BLACK WOMEN IN E. FLIMSY SUMMER DRESS WHO'S OBVIOUSLY CARRYING NOTHING OTHER THAN A MOBILE PHONE FACING UP TO THEM AND I THINK CERTAINLY WHEN YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN BATON ROUGE THEY ARE DETERMINED WITH THEIR CARDBOARD SIGNS TO FACE UP TO THE POLICE THEY HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN LARGE NUMBERS ON SATURDAY NIGHT IT WAS OVER ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE
ARRESTED THEY'VE SINCE BEEN LATE GO BUT THEY ARE DETERMINED TO KEEP UP SOME KIND OF PRESENCE EVEN IF IT'S A LESSER PEASANTS AS IT IS TONIGHT AND THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY BEING DRIVEN BY RAGE BY ANGER BUT ARE THERE ARE ALSO SPECIFIC THINGS THAT THEY WANT THE POLICE TO DO
THEY WANT THE OFFICERS RESPONSIBLE FOR ORTON'S STERLING SETH TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THEY DO NOT TRUST THE SYSTEMS I THINK OF THE TWO CITIES WHERE BLACK MEN WERE KILLED BY POLICE LAST WEEK THIS WAS THE ONE THAT CAUSED THE MOST CONCERN CERTAINLY IT WAS THE ONE WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ACTED WITH URGENCY THEY TOOK OVER THE INVESTIGATION
AND THEY ARE HOLDING THAT VERY INTIMATE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION WHEREAS IN MINNESOTA THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND I THINK EVEN BLACK LIVES MATTER ACTIVISTS WERE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN HERE THEY'VE CALLED FOR A COW THIS IS AN AREA WITH A REAL HISTORY OF SLAVERY AND CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLES AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FAR WHEN YOU SPEAK TO A NUMBER OF THESE PROTESTERS MAY FEEL THAT SURFACE IN THE POLICE HERE
IT'S SOMETHING THEY'VE ENDURED FOR A LONG TIME AND KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SOLIDARITY NOW THAT THEY HAVE UNITY
# BEEF THERE OF GIVE JOINED TOGETHER IN THAT COLLECTIVE RATE THE WANT POLICE TO BE HELD MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND THEY WANT THE PRA OUR T.V. CERTAINLY ARE PERCEIVED BRUTALITY TO END LAURA REBECCA THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY TO SEVEN LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THERE IS NO ESCAPING THE SMILING FACE OF ANDY MURRAY WIMBLEDON CHAMPION ON THE FRONT PAGE OF EVERY PAPER THE MALE PICTURES IN WITH HIS ARMS WRAPPED AROUND THE TROPHY THE EXPRESS CALLS A MAGNIFICENT MURRAY
ONCE HAD A PHOTO OF HIM KISSING THE SILVER CUP THE TIME CELEBRATES WITH A SPECIAL WRAP AROUND COVER SHOWING HIM PUNCHING THE AIR WITH THE WORDS HE'S DONE IT AGAIN THE TELEGRAPH AT LAST SOMETHING FOR THE WHOLE NATION TO CHEER BUT IT DOES ADD WITH BRITAIN DIVIDED BY BRECK'S HIDDEN SODDEN BY SUMMER RAIN ANDY MURRAY PROVIDES SOME WELCOME WARMTH WITH A MAGNIFICENT VICTORY
THERE'S PLENTY OF DISCUSSION AS TO WHAT LAY BEHIND ANDY MURRAY SUCCESS SOME SPORTS WRITERS POINT TO THE CHAMPIONS DEVASTATING RETURN OF SERVE THE TELEGRAPHS JIM WHITE SAYS EVEN AS MILOSZ ROUND WHICH FIRED DOWN THE BALL AT SPEEDS OF UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILES AN HOUR MARIA USE THE FORCE OF THE SERVE AGAINST HIM RETURNING THE BALL WITH VICIOUS SPIN OTHER PAPERS EXAMINE HOW HIS LIFE HAS CHANGED OFF THE COURT NOTING THAT THE BIRTH OF MARIE'S DAUGHTER SOPHIA FIVE MONTHS AGO WAS GIVEN HIM EXTRA MOTIVATION
# IT SEEMS SHE ALSO HELPED HIM ARRIVE FRESH FOR THE FINAL ACCORDING TO THE SUN MURRAY TOLD PRINCE WILLIAM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MATCH THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD SLEPT THROUGH FOR THE PAST THREE NIGHTS SOMETHING WHICH THE PINK PRINCE DESCRIBED AS A GOOD OMEN THE MIRROR LEADS WITH THE BID BY THE FORM OF SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY ANGELA EAGLE TO TOPPLE JEREMY CORBIN IT'S POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT BEN GLAZE AGAS OF THEIR SURVIVAL MY IS AT STAKE GORDON HAS VOWED DIVIDE ON HE'D SAID FIGHT ON HE SAID HE COMMANDS THE SUPPORT OF THE VAST MAJORITY
OF THE PARTY'S MEMBERSHIP AT THE TIMES HE'S SCATHING ABOUT HIM IT SAYS THE M.P.S EFFORTS TO UNSEAT WAS CORBIN AND NOT SOME SHADY PROCEDURAL MANOEUVRE BUT A BELATED NECESSARY BUT EVEN VALIANT ATTEMPT TO RESTORE LABOURED TO BEING A CREDIBLE FORCE THERE'S ALSO PLENTY OF COVERAGE OF THE RACE TO SUCCEED DAVID CAMERON WITH THERESA MAY PROMISING TO CRACK DOWN ON EXECUTIVE PAY IF SHE BECOMES PRIME MINISTER THE FINANCIAL TIMES SUPPORT SHE WANTS BUT WORKERS ON THE BOARDS OF BRITISH COMPANIES AS WELL AS IMPOSE TIGHTER CONTROLS ON PAY
IT'S SO PITCH IS RISKY GIVEN SHE NEEDS THE SUPPORT OF OLDER RIGHT WING CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS TO BECOME PARTY LEADER AND JAMES KIRK AT WRITING IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WARNS AGAINST WRITING OFF THE CHANCES OF MISSUS MAY'S RIVAL ANDREA LEAD SOME HE SAYS MANY TORY MEMBERS FEEL INSULTED AND IGNORED BY THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER MAY SEE VOTING FOR MISSUS LEADS HIM AS A DIRECT REBUKE TO MISTER CAMERON'S PROJECT
# THE GUARDIAN HAS A TRAIL OF AIRPORT DELAYS AT STANSTED BECAUSE OF THE WRONG KIND OF SUNSHINE IT SAYS THE SETTING SUN IS CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR PASSENGERS WITH BIOMETRIC PASSPORTS THAT'S BECAUSE THE CAMERAS IN THE PASSPORT ALL THE POINTING DIRECTLY INTO THE SUN'S GLARE ON SUMMER EVENINGS AND THAT STOPS THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO CHECK WITH THE PEOPLE'S FACES ACTUALLY MATCH THE IMAGE STORED IN THE PASSPORT
AND EXPERTS TOLD THE GUARDIAN THE HUMAN EYES WELL ADAPTED TO HANDLE BRIGHT LIGHT CAMERAS ARE GETTING BETTER BUT THEY ARE STILL NOT PERFECT IT'S NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTENDER ANDRA LED SOME HAS APOLOGISED FOR SUGGESTING THAT HAVING CHILDREN MADE HER A BETTER CANDIDATE THAN HER RIVAL TO REASON
# TOMORROW IS THE BIGGEST DAY IN WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE MARCHING SEASON IN NORTHERN IRELAND WHEN LOYALISTS ORANGEMEN PARADE THROUGH THE STREETS THANKS TO PEACE AND IMPROVED RELATIONS IT'S A DAY THAT'S FAR LESS FRAUGHT THAN IT ONCE WAS BUT IN SOME AREAS THERE IS STILL SERIOUS TENSION AND DIVISION
THAT DIVISION IS ALSO EVIDENT IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND VOTED IN THE REFERENDUM THE MAJORITY VOTED TO REMAIN AS DID MOST POLITICAL PARTIES INCLUDING MODERATE UNION UNION S. A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY THOUGH VOTED TO LEAVE ENCOURAGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTY CENTRAL REPORTS
EVERY TWELFTH OF JULY MEN AND BOYS FROM LOYALIST ESTATES IN NORTH BELFAST
PARADE IN UNIFORM WITH DRUMS AND FLUTES AND SUPPORTERS DOWN WHAT'S BECOME THE MOST CONTENTIOUS VOTE IN THE CITY
THREE YEARS AGO THE PARADES COMMISSION CHANGE THEIR RETURN ROUTE TO STOP THEM MARCHING BACK IN THE PAST SHOPS AND HOMES IN THE NATIONALIST AREA OF A DOOR
EVER SINCE THE ORANGE ORDER'S BEEN PROTESTING I JOINED THEM ONE EVENING LAST WEEK SPENCER BEATTIE IS THE DEPUTY COUNTY GRAND MASTER OF THE ORANGE LODGE OF BELFAST THAT'S THE POLICE WAITING FOR HER IN THE ORANGE PARADE COMING UP
ON A SNAKE YOU PROTEST THIS IS A PROTEST IT'S NOT A PARADE
THIS IS INNATELY PROTEST YES AND WHY DO YOU HOLD IN EVERY SINGLE NIGHT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PROTEST HERE FOR THE LAST BY AN EXCESS OF THOUSAND DAYS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL WE GET A THROUGH IT
AROUND TWENTY MEN IN ORANGE COLLARS WALKED SLOWLY UP THE ROAD SIX ARMOURED POLICE CARS BLOCK THEIR WAY IT LOOKED LIKE A WELL REHEARSED ROUTINE THE ORANGEMEN STOPPED WITHOUT OBJECTION CHATTED WITH THE OFFICERS EVEN TOOK PHOTOS
THREE YEARS AGO THIS POINT ON THE TWELFTH OF JULY THEY WERE SERIOUS DISTURBANCES AND THERE'S BEEN TROUBLE SINCE THEY POLICE THIS YEAR SO TENSIONS ARE NOT AS MUCH AS THEY'VE BEEN IN THE PAST
FATHER GARY DONNEGAN THE LOCAL CATHOLIC HOLY CROSS CHURCH HAS BEEN TRYING TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE AT THE MOMENT THERE IS KIND OF
I KIND OF A SIMMERING ON REST IN TERMS OF OFF THERE IS NO RETURN PREYED ON THE TWELFTH OF JULY THERE IS A MORNING PARADE AND THE RESULT OF THAT MEANS THAT
POSSIBLE TENSION ON THE LOYALIST UNIONIST PROTESTANT COMMUNITY AND APPREHENSION OF HOW THAT WILL ACTUALLY MANIFESTED ITSELF ON THE NASH OF REPUBLICAN CATHOLIC SAID OF THE PAINTING THERE'S DIVISION TWO OVER THE E.U. REFERENDUM
EVERYONE I SPOKE TO WITH THE PROTEST MEMBERS OF THE ORANGE ORDER BANDSMEN TOLD ME THEY HAD VOTED LEAVE ON A PATCH OF WASTE GROUND IN THE PROTESTERS CARAVAN I MET TINA PATRICK A VOLUNTEER
IN HER COAT PATTERNED WITH UNION JACKS UNION JACK CUSHIONS BY HER SIDE SHE EXPLAINED WHY SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR NORTHERN IRELAND TO LEAVE THE E.U.
REASONS ECHOED THOSE I'VE HEARD IN POST INDUSTRIAL PARTS OF ENGLAND WE HAVE LAST QUITE A LOT I ENTERED A STRAY WITHIN THERE SIR YOU ARE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T GET JOBS
WE HAVE LOST OUR MELONS WE HAVE LAST
I PULLED IT OUT BUT CAN'T SO THAT WE COULD DO MORE FOR OURSELVES A'IGHT THEN
BUT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS REALLY HELPED NORTHERN IRELAND IN TERMS OF GRANTS IN TERMS OF SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS MILLIONS OF EUROS
HOW LONG IN THAT POOL
WE NEED TO LAND TO SUSTAIN OURSELVES AND THE MORE THAT THAN IRELAND I DON'T THINK WE CAN CONTINUE TO STAY AND SUSTAIN OURSELVES WE NEED TO LEARN DA DE DAH PURRS
MOST PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND THOUGH SEE THE SITUATION DIFFERENTLY THEY VOTED TO REMAIN
AND IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING THE VOTE THERE WAS A GREAT RUN ON IRISH PASSPORT APPLICATIONS
PEOPLE HERE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR DUAL NATIONALITY POST OFFICES RAN OUT OF FORMS
BUT NOW A SIGN THAT CALMS RETURNED INSIDE THE MAIN POST OFFICE HERE IN BELFAST IS A BIG PILE OF IRISH PASSPORT APPLICATION FORMS AND I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE PICKING ONE UP
IT'S REALLY GOOD HERE FOR THE NORTH
THERE WILL BE A OF PROBLEMS FOR NORTH AND SOUTH IT'S REAR AND STUFF
IN THE CITY CENTRE SOME PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OTHERS LOOKED FORWARD TO A UNITED IRELAND I'M ACTUALLY GLAD BECAUSE NOW THAT THAT'S HARBOURNE MORE COUNTRIES HAVE ONE OFFERED FOR THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND OF ONE COUNTRY GETS AT THE NEXT ONE'S GOING TO GET ANSWERS GOING TO BE A LOG ON THE FIRE
BETTER THAN ON THE WANTED EVERYTHING IS UNCERTAIN NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF FLEX IT WOULD BE
AND WOULD THERE BE A NEW BORDER HOW WOULD THAT WORK
WITH NORTHERN IRELAND BE BETTER OFF WITH BRITAIN ALL WITH IRELAND IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
FEW PEOPLE EXPECT A CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN THE SHORT TERM THOUGH SO WHERE'S THE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE AND THE MARCHING SEASON APPROACHES ITS HEIGHT FATHER DONNEGAN BACK IN ARDOYNE IS WORKING HARD TO KEEP THE ARGUMENTS AND THE MARCHING APART IT'S QUITE COMPLEX AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO WAIT TO SEE HOW THIS CLEARS OUT
YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY IN THE MARCHING SEASON ARE AS WE CALLED A MAD TIME IN A SENSE WE HAVE TO NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO USE WHAT DOES HAPPEN AND IT TO KIND OF BE CLEARED OUT OF THE STREETS OF OUR DINER BELFAST
# THAT WILL CENSURE BERG REPORTING THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN FIFTY M. P. DECLARES SHE WANTS TO BE THE LEADER OF A PARTY THE LEAST YOU CAN RELY ON IS THE SUPPORT OF HER CONSTITUENCY OR SO YOU MIGHT THINK WHAT SO PERHAPS IN THE CASE OF ANGELA EAGLE WHO WANTS TO BE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY PAUL DAVIS IS THE VICE CHAIR OF HER CONSTITUENCY WALLAH SEE HE'S ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
COME ON JUMP AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN SOME EMAILS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSING AROUND IN YOUR CONSTITUENCY WHAT A WHICH ONCE EMOTION THAT SAYS THIS C. L. P. HAS NO CONFIDENCE IN ANGELA EAGLE M.P. OR TRYING TO
WELL THERE IS A MOTION TO THAT EFFECT AND I'M SURE THAT WILL BE A DEBATE OUR NEXT MEETING ON THE TWENTY SECOND AND WHAT'LL HAPPEN DO YOU THINK I DON'T NOTICE HIM TWELVE HUNDRED MEMBERS OF A PARTY NOW IN WHILE I SEE THAT WAS NINE HUNDRED BEFORE THE TWENTY FOURTH OF JUNE I CAN'T POSSIBLY SAY WERE ALL TWELVE ONTO THOSE PEOPLE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY LIVELY DEBATE DO YOU RECKON THAT MOST OF YOUR SALE PEEL IT A ROOM CORGAN SUPPORTERS
NO WAY OF KNOWING I'VE NEVER ASKED ANYBODY REALLY HAS NOT BEEN IN THIS OH NOBODY MUST HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT MUCH YOU MUST TALK ABOUT NOTHING ELSE NO WELL YOU KNOW UP UNTIL THE TWENTY FOURTH OF JUNE ANGELA EAGLE WAS SUPPORTING JEREMY CORBIN SO THE PARTY WAS UNITED IN ONE AUSSIE SINCE THEN
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE NOT A NICE BUILT TO A FIT ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE NOW THEY'RE GONNA FOLD ALL THAT WOW THEY SUPPORT HOW DID YOU WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
I WANNA SEE IF ELECTION NOW WE'RE BOTH PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT PAPER RIDER AROUND THEIR MEMBERS TO DECIDE WHO DO YOU THINK'S THE BEST LEADING KNOW ABOUT WHO'S THE BEST CONSTITUENCY M.P. THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO BE IN A GOOD CAUSE M.P. WHO'S THE BEST LEADER
RIGHT BUT HERE'S THE THING ISN'T IT IF THE M.P.S SAY THAT MISTER CORBIN SHOULD NOT BE ON ABOUT THE BALLET BECAUSE HE WON'T UNLESS OF COURSE HE GETS FIFTY ONE M.P.S TO SUPPORT HIM IF HE FAILS TO GET FIFTY ONE M.P.S THEN HE SHOULDN'T BE ON THE BALLOT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT
I THINK THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE UNITED IN BELIEVING IN DEMOCRACY IN FAIRNESS AND
YOU KNOW HE WON CLEARLY LAST TIME WHEN THE LABOUR PARTY WANTED TO WIDEN DEMOCRACY THEY'VE GOT ONE DEMOCRACY AND DIDN'T LIKE THE RESULT I DO THEN THAT'S VERY GOOD AND YOU KNOW I NO LIKE ME HAD A GREAT FAN OF FOOTBALL PORTUGAL NEARLY ONE MY STEADY ON WITH THAT I THINK A MAN WHEN HE'S DOWN SICK PUT YOU ON THE EARLY ONE LAST NIGHT
BY A GOAL THAT THEY COULD HAVE SCORED FROM A FOUL THAT WASN'T REALLY A FOUL THE REF A REAR HERE LOSING MAY HAVE BEEN WELL OUT NOT THE REST OF THE PEOPLE THE REFEREE BY THE LAWS GAVE THE FINAL THE WARM
THAT WHALE ON IT WOULD'VE THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WILL THINK IF ANGELA EAGLE WINDSOR CONTEST AGAINST GEM FOR LEADERSHIP WITHOUT JEREMY KORBEN BEING ON THE BALLOT PAPER THAT'S FAIR IT MIGHT BE WITHIN THE RULES I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS TO BE DECIDED NEW QUITE MUST QUOTE AT THE RULES BEFORE BUT IT WAS SOMETHING PEOPLE THINK WAS FAIR AND I THOUGHT IN THE THINGS DEMOCRACY ALL RIGHT WHAT SO WHAT DO YOU THINK PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE
RULES THAT SAY YOU CAN STAND IN AN ELECTION FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY GO TO THE MEMBERSHIP THAT IS IF YOU HAVE THE SUPPORT OF A GIVEN NUMBER GIVEN PROPORTION OF M.P.S THEN THAT'S FINE THAT'S PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THAT GIVEN A NUMBER OF M.P.S THEN YOU CAN'T STAND WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
I DON'T SEE THE RULES READING THAT WAY IN THAT WILL PROBABLY END UP THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO DECIDE ISN'T IT IT IS BUT YOU KNOW I WOULD HOPE THESE M.P.S WHO HAVEN'T BEEN LISTENING TO PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME WOULD SAY MAYBE DIDN'T SUPPORT JEREMY CORBIN LAST TIME
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING STARING OUT THERE THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN POLITICS BEFORE WHO DO SUPPORT HIM MAYBE HE SHOULD BE ON THE BALLOT PAPER AGAIN UNLESS OF COURSE THEY ARE THROUGH DEMOCRACY WOULD BE DON'T USE OFTEN THESE DAYS UNLESS THEY'RE SORT OF ENTRY ISTS OR SOMEBODY WRAPS UP TROUBLEMAKERS OR PERHAPS EVEN TORIES SOON JOIN THE PARTY SAID WE WANT TO KEEP
WE JUST HAD THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ENTRIES JOIN THE LABOUR PARTY AND WHILE HE SAID AND THINK WE HAD THAT MANY INTERESTING BACCHANAL HEYDAYS AND MILITANT SO OTHER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND INTEREST INTO LABOUR PARTY WHEN THEY SOLD THE NOW MEMBERS DUST DEMOCRACY PAUL DAVIES THANKS VERY MUCH
# IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN PEOPLE LIVING IN BRITAIN'S SEASIDE TOWNS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE POORLY EDUCATED UNEMPLOYED CLAIM BENEFITS AND LIVE IN HOUSES WHERE THEY HAVE TO SHARE FACILITIES THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE BRITISH HOSPITALITY ASSOCIATION IT WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO APPOINT A SEASIDE SAR TO HELP REVIVE STRUGGLING COASTAL TOWNS
WELL IF HE IBRAHIM IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE BRITISH HOSPITALITY ASSOCIATION AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK EH SEASIDES A CAN DO I MEAN AFTER ALL THERE WAS ONE APPOINTED BACK IN TWENTY THAT DUNCAN BALLANTYNE UNDER GORDON BROWN WHAT DIFFERENCE CAN THEY MAKE WE NEED TSAR THAT WILL ACTUALLY STAY THE COURSE
SOMEBODY THOSE ABSOLUTELY DEDICATED TO MAKING THIS HAPPEN NOT JUST FOR GLOSS BUT FOR REAL SO SOMEONE LIKE LORD HESELTINE WHO CAN REALLY HELP TO TRANSFORM AND REGENERATE COASTAL COMMUNITIES JUST AS HASN'T FINDED FOR LIVERPOOL
WHAT IS THE PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH COASTAL COMMUNITIES I MEAN IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE BUT YOU AGAIN IN THIS REPORT OUT TODAY I LIKE THE PARTICULAR PROBLEM ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS THAT WE HAVE A FANTASTIC COASTLINE IN THIS COUNTRY THOUSANDS OF MILES AND ONLY A FRACTION OF THAT HUGE COASTLINE HAS BEEN TAPPED INTO FOR THE ASSETS THAT IT PROVIDES TO CREATING THRIVING ECONOMIES
WITH HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM HAS BEEN PART OF THAT WHAT WE WANT IS TO HELP TO HELP TO UNLOCK THAT THRIVING BOOSTING ECONOMY ACROSS ALL COASTLINE AND ALL COASTAL COMMUNITIES WERE NOT I. TOURISM AND SOME IS IT TOURISM THAT YOU THINK IS THE ANSWER TOURISM CAN BE PART OF THE ANSWER THIS IS NOT ONLY ABOUT TOURISM YOU NEED TO HAVE A GOOD STRONG DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY SO THAT THESE PIECES CAN BE GREAT PIECES TO WORK LIVE AND ALSO THEN TO VISIT
THE I MEAN ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES YOU'VE GOT IS THAT
AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE BRITISH COASTLINE IS SOME PARTS OF IT PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE TOWNS ARE NOT THEIR RUN DOWN IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF FLYING CHEAPLY TO THE MED WHERE YOU CAN HAVE GUARANTEED SUN OR GOING TO I'M NOT GOING TO NAME A TOWN BUT SOMEWHERE WHERE IT MAY RAIN THE WHOLE TIME YOU'RE THERE WHY WOULD YOU PICK THE LATTER
TOURISM ACTIVITIES CHANGED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS YOU MAY GO ON ONE MAIN VACATION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT NOW MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING INCREASINGLY ADDITIONAL BREAKS SO YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK IN COURT ONE QUARTER TO QUARTER THREE QUARTER FOR AND YOU CAN GET IF WE WEATHER EVERYWHERE ACROSS EUROPE THIS SUMMER IT HASN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY GREAT IN TERMS OF WEATHER CONDITIONS SO I DON'T THINK WHETHER WOULD HOLD BACK
THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE THESE TOWNS INTO THRIVING COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE CAN LIVE AS I SAID WORK ENJOY AND BE VISITED AND YOU SAY YOU WANT A SEASIDE SADE TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE TO STAY THE COURSE UNLIKE THE RUM IN THERE THE PREVIOUS ONE AREN'T YOU INVESTING TOO MUCH HOPE IN WHAT ONE INDIVIDUAL CAN DO
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A LEADER BUT IT'S NOT JUST A LEADER WE HAVE IS SUE TODAY A SEVEN POINT PLAN AND PART OF THAT IS TO CREATE A COASTAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY IF YOU HAVE A STRATEGY WHICH HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED YOU NEED TO HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WHO WILL HELP TO CREATE
THE DYNAMICS AND TO DELIVER ON THAT STRATEGY THE ROLE OF THE TSAR IS TO ACTUALLY BRING THOSE GROUPS TOGETHER INVESTORS THE PRIVATE SECTOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND MINISTER IN D.C. ALGAE AND OTHERS TO WORK TOGETHER AND ONE TSAR A CAPTAIN COAST IF YOU LIKE IS ABSOLUTELY INVALUABLE CAPTAIN CASED AND WON ONE TOWN THAT'S DOING IT WELL WHERE WOULD YOU POINT TO AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A LOOK AT BOURNEMOUTH FOLKESTONE THERE ARE MANY AREAS THAT ARE DOING IT
# IF IT WERE HIM THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TALKING OF THE WEATHER AND ALL THAT RISK FOR THIS IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT'S THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO PACK THAT SO WE'VE GOT LOW PRESSURE IN CHARGE AT THE MOMENT COOL NORTHWESTERLY WINDS FEEDING HIM BUT IF YOU'RE OUT OF THE WIND HE MANAGED TO GET A BIT OF SUNSHINE
HE'LL FEEL O.K. OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT TODAY THEY'RE NOT A GREAT DEAL OF SUNSHINE TO BE FOUND FIRST THING MOST OF US STARTING OFF CLOUDY TODAY WE DO HAVE RAIN OR SHOWERS AFFECTING QUITE A FEW AREAS ACROSS SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS AND EASTERN ENGLAND IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF DRY WEATHER THIS MORNING TO A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS MOST STARTING ON A CLOUDY NOTE AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY THINGS WILL BRIGHTEN UP THERE'LL BE SOME SUNSHINE DEVELOPING BUT AS THE TEMPERATURES BEGIN TO RISE IN THE AFTERNOON WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME SHOWERS MOVING IN IN THOSE SHOWERS

UNION SAYS THE COMPANY HAS CUT TRAINS TO TRY TO RIG APPALLING PERFORMANCE FIGURES BUT SOUTHERN SAYS IT'LL STILL BE RUNNING AT NINETY FIVE PERCENT CAPACITY DURING PEAK TIMES TWO AND FROM LONDON VICTORIA

CELEBRATIONS IN PUBLIC SQUARES AND LIVING ROOMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN THE WHISTLE BLEW AFTER EXTRA TIME

IT HELPED ERASE THE MEMORY OF LOSING TO GREECE IN THE FINAL OF THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS WHEN THEY WERE HELD IN PORTUGAL TWELVE YEARS AGO
FOR A COUNTRY THAT HAS SUFFERED HARD TIMES IN RECENT YEARS SEEING HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS EMIGRATE TO MORE PROSPEROUS ECONOMIES INCLUDING FRANCE THIS IS A SWEET VICTORY NOT ONLY TEN MILLION PEOPLE IN PORTUGAL ARE CELEBRATING BUT MILLIONS OF PORTUGUESE
# ALISON ROBERTS ARE REPORTING IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN ANGELA EAGLE IS TO LAUNCH A BID TO BE THE LABOUR'S LABOUR LEADER TODAY JEREMY CORBIN IS MEDICALLY HE WILL NOT RESIGN BUT THE RULES ARE NOT CLEAR WHETHER HE HAS TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF M.P.S TO GET HIS NAME ON THE BALLOT PAPER SO IT COULD BE DOWN TO A COURT TO DECIDE OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS IS HERE TO EXPLAIN
TAKE US THROUGH WHY THERE IS A DISPUTE YESTERDAY WE HAD THE EXTRAORDINARY PROSPECT OF A LABOUR LEADER TAKING HIS OWN PARTY TO COURT IF HE DIDN'T GET THE RESULT HE WANTED OUT OF THIS THE ISSUE COMES UP BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT AND ARGUABLY INCREDIBLE DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE RULE BOOK THIS IS THE SECTION THAT DEALS WITH LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES WHERE THERE IS NO VACANCY NOMINATION MAYBE THOUGHT BY POTENTIAL CHALLENGES
EACH YEAR PRIOR TO THE ANNUAL SESSION OF PARTY CONFERENCE IN THIS CASE ANY NOMINATION MUST BE SUPPORTED BY TWENTY PER CENT OF THE COMBINED COMMONS MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY NOW SO THIS IS THE ISSUE DOES THAT ONLY MEAN ANY NOMINATION FOR A POTENTIAL CHALLENGER NEEDS THAT TWENTY PER CENT FIFTY ONE M.P.S OR DOES IT INCLUDE THE LEADER AS WELL NOW LABOUR HAVE
TWO DIFFERENT BITS OF LEGAL ADVICE OFFERING TO ENTIRELY CONTRARY OPINIONS ON THIS JEREMY CORBIN'S OPPONENT SAY THAT THIS IS PERFECTLY SIMPLE NEIL KINNOCK WAS THE LEADER BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT HE WAS CHALLENGED BY TONY BENN LAW IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT HE DID GET NOMINATION SO THERE'S A PRECEDENT AND THEY DON'T THINK QUITE POSSIBLY RIGHTLY THAT JEREMY CORBIN CAN GET THOSE NOMINATIONS
BUT THIS ISN'T A JOKE WHO'S A BARRISTER A QUEEN'S COUNSEL HE'S PUBLICLY VOCIFEROUSLY OPPOSED TO JEREMY CORBIN INVOLVED IN LABOUR POLITICS BUT HE ARGUES ON THIS LEGAL POINT CORBIN IS RIGHT BECAUSE PRESTON DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT HE SAYS IF YOU READ A CONTRACT WRONGLY IN THE PAST IT DOESN'T MAKE THAT FALSE READING CORRECT IN THE FUTURE AND THE RULES HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES
FROM TWO THOUSAND TIBETAN POTENTIAL CHALLENGERS NEEDED TO HIT THE TWENTY PERCENT THRESHOLD BUT PRE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
EVERYONE NEEDED TO HIT THE THRESHOLD SO EVEN IF IT'S RIGHT TO SAY THAT NEIL CONNECT WHEN CHALLENGED NEEDED TO HIT IT IT TELLS YOU NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT WHETHER AFTER A RULE CHANGE JEREMY KORBEN WOULD BE TICKETED SO ROSS WHO IS GOING TO WIN THE ARGUMENT WELL THE ANY SEA GETS THE FIRST DECISION THEY'RE LIKELY TO MEET TOMORROW IF THIS FORMAL CHALLENGE HAPPENS TODAY THE ONLY SEA IS NOT A DUSTY YOU LAWYERS CONCLAVE THIS WILL BE A TEST OF POLITICAL MIGHT IN A PRETTY EVENLY DIVIDED COMMITTEE POSSIBLY FOLLOW
BY LEGAL CHALLENGE THEY'LL ALSO HAVE TO DECIDE AFTER WHICH FOLK NEW MEMBERS AFTER WHICH DATE NEW MEMBERS DON'T GET TO VOTE AND HOW MUCH TO CHARGE THOSE REGISTERED SUPPORTERS WHO FAMOUSLY PAID JUST THREE POUNDS LAST TIME AND EITHER WAY THE OUTCOMES BLOODY KEEP JEREMY CORBIN SUPPORTERS OH KEEP JEREMY CORBIN OFF THE BALLET AND HIS SUPPORTERS ARE VERY UNLIKELY TO ACCEPT THE RESULT IF HE'S ON THE BALLOT IT MAYBE THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM FOR HIM TO WIN THERE IS SIMPLY NO RISK FREE WAY OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE HIM TO ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE
O.K. ROSS HAWKINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL SITTING ALONGSIDE RIGHT HERE IN THE STUDIOS CHRISTINE SHAW CROFT WHO IS ON THE N.E. SEE THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SHE'S VERY MUCH HERE IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY WE SHOULD MAKE CLEAR RATHER THAN SPEAKING FOR THEM GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND YOU THINK THAT JEREMY CORBIN HAS TO BE ON THAT BALLOT DON'T IT YES HE'S QUITE CLEAR TO ME FROM THE RULES ANY NOMINATIONS THE SECTION ANY NOMINATIONS REFERS TO POTENTIAL CHALLENGERS
ALSO WHEN THE RULE WAS TIDIED UP AND WENT TO CONFERENCE SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE AT THE EXPLANATION ALONGSIDE THAT'S THAT RULE WHICH WAS IN THE CONFERENCE PAPERS ANYONE CAN READ IT AND IT ACTUALLY SAID THIS REQUIRES POTENTIAL CHALLENGERS TO SEEK NOMINATIONS POTENTIAL CHALLENGERS AND THAT WENT THROUGH CONFERENCE O.K. YOU ARE JUST ONE MEMBER ON THE N.E. SEE THERE AND IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR WHEN YOU ALL SIT DOWN TOMORROW AND IT WILL BE TOMORROW WON'T IT YOU DECIDE
WHICH WAY WILL GO I'VE NOT ACTUALLY HAD A NOTICE FOR THIS MEETING YET BUT I'M TOLD THERE'S A MEETING TOMORROW IT WILL BE UP TO THE THE N.E.C. TO DECIDE WE'LL SEE WHAT RECOMMENDATION WE GET FROM THE GENERAL SECRETARY BUT I THINK MOST OF US ARE QUITE CLEAR WHAT THE RULES ARE SAYING AND THE ONLY REASON WE'RE HAVING THIS ARGUMENT IS THAT JEREMY CORBIN HIS OPPONENTS WANT TO KEEP HIM OFF THE BALLOT PAPER BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR ONLY HOPE OF WINNING WHEN HE IS ON THAT BALLOT PAPER HE WILL WIN
HAVE YOU SEEN THE LEGAL ADVICE THERE JEREMY CORBIN A SCENE BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY'VE HAD LEGAL ADVICE THAT SUPPOSEDLY SAYS HE DOESN'T NEED THE SUPPORT OF LABOUR M.P.S HAVE YOU SEEN THAT ADVICE HE'D BEEN GIVEN IT AND THE ANY SEA HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN EITHER SETS OF ADVICE YEAH I HAVE ACTUALLY INFORMALLY SINGING BARRISTER ADVICE WHICH SAYS THAT YES HE SHOULD BE ON THE BALLOT PAPER HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GET THE NOMINATIONS OF COURSE WHAT COULD THEN HAPPEN IS THAT THERE IS A LEGAL CHALLENGE WHICHEVER WAY IT GOES
I WOULD'VE HOPED THAT WE DON'T NEED TO BE GOING DOWN THIS ROAD IF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY WE JUST ACCEPT THE DEMOCRATIC MANDATE THAT JEREMY HAS OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM AND SINCE THEN MEMBERSHIP AS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED I REALLY DOES AND WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS PROBLEM THAT'S INTERESTING COS ANOTHER THING YOU HAVE TO DECIDE TOMORROW IS WHO GETS TO VOTE OF THE MEMBERSHIP THEY'RE WORTH HE WAS ELECTED BY FIFTY NINE PER CENT OF THE REGISTERED WHAT NOT INCLUDING THE REGISTERED SUPPORTERS LAST TIME YOU PAID THREE POUNDS
WHAT HAPPENS THIS TIME WHEN'S THE CUT OFF POINT FOR THOSE WHO CAN SIGN UP FOR A RELATIVELY MINIMAL AMOUNT AND VOTE WELL THAT'S GOT BE DECIDED BY THE N.E.C. AND ALSO THE AMOUNT THEY PAY I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO BE THREE POUNDS BUT I THINK A LOT OF THE MEMBERSHIP INCREASE WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS
IS THOSE REGISTERED SUPPORTERS SIGNING UP AS FULL MEMBERS WHICH IS WHAT THE INTENTION ALWAYS WAS WE WANT FULL MEMBERS OF THE LABOUR PUT THE CUT OFF WILL BE WHEN IT WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE ELECTION LAST TIME IT WAS IT WAS TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION LAST TIME BUT THAT'S THAT'S YET TO BE DECIDED OH KAY SO LET'S SAY HE GETS HE DID HE DOESN'T NEED THE WRIST SUPPORT OF EM PEAS WHICH YOU KNEW EXCEPT YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET
WELL WE'D HAVE TO SEE BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON TO KEEP OFF THE BALLOT PAPER AND THAT'S TO HAVE CONTEMPT FOR THE VIEWS OF THE MEMBERSHIP O.K. BUT HE AND HE HAS THE ODD THERE ARE GOING TO BE HE'S HAVING CONTEMPT FOR OF THE VIEWS OF THOSE HE NEEDS TO LEAD SO WE HAVE A SITUATION LET'S SAY WHERE HE'S ON THE BALLOT HE'S REALLY ELECTED HE'S THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY HOW DOES HE OPPOSED THERE WERE NONE OF HIS M.P.S WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
WELL I WOULD HOPE THAT THE HEN PEAS WERE THEN I ACCEPT THE DEMOCRATIC DECISION OF THE MEMBERS WE WE DON'T WANT TO BE AT WAR THE MEMBERSHIP AND THE AND THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY LIKE THIS WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP BUT WE REALLY CANNOT HAVE THE M.P.S WHO WE ALL SUPPORT WE ALL RESPECT WE CAN'T HAVE THEM TONY MANNERS SAYING WELL I'M SORRY VOTE IN THE WRONG WAY WE DON'T ACCEPT IT BUT THESE LOOK A DEMOCRACY WORK FOR THE INTERESTING THING IS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED FOR HIM AND SAY LOOK HE'S
WHATEVER ELSE HE IS HE'S NOT AN EFFECTIVE LEADER I WAS SAYING THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS IS SUCH THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF
CERTAIN M.P.S IF THERE'S A SPLIT IN THE BODY OF THE LABOUR PARTY SPLIT ARE YOU SAYING LOOK THAT'S THE PRICE FOR THE POSITION THAT WE'RE TAKING NOT AT ALL I'M HOPING THE LABOUR PARTY DOESN'T SPLIT AND THE PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT A DEMOCRATIC MANDATE I DON'T THINK IT'S QUESTION OF JEREMY'S LEADERSHIP QUALITIES IT'S PEOPLE A POLITICALLY OPPOSED TO HIM HE'S BRAVE HE'S HONESTY'S PRINCIPLE HE DOESN'T BACK DOWN UNDER PRESSURE THEY SOUND LIKE PRETTY GOOD LEADERSHIP QUALITIES TO WAS
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGH WHO SUGGEST THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS JUST THE CONCLUSION OF A BATTLE THAT WAS PROBABLY COMING ANYWAY A BATTLE FOR WHO IS WHERE ON THE LEFT AND THAT THE PARTY MAY END UP SPLITTING DO YOU ACCEPT THAT WHICHEVER WAY IT GOES THAT'S A POSSIBILITY
I JUST HOPE THAT EVERYONE COMES TOGETHER YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT A DEMOCRATIC DECISION WHEN TONY BLAIR WAS A LEADER I HAD TO PUT UP WITH IT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WAS RATHER UNHAPPY ABOUT THE INVASION OF IRAQ BEING CHIEF AMONGST THEM BUT YOU JUST YOU JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT A DEMOCRATIC DECISION NOW JEREMY'S GOT A MANDATE FAR FAR LARGER THAN THAN ANY LEADERS EVER GOT BEFORE WE SHOULD WE SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THIS PROBLEM EVERYONE SHOULD GET BEHIND HIM AND DO YOU THINK IF IT COMES TO A GENERAL ELECTION HE CAN
GAIN SEATS FOR M.P.S DEFINITELY WE'VE WE'VE WON A GREAT MANY QUE PARLIAMENTARY BY ELECTIONS POLICE CRIME COMMISSIONER ELECTIONS IN TORY SHIRE COUNTIES AND SO ON OF COURSE WE CAN WIN A GENERAL ELECTION WE CHRISTINE SHAW CRAFT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE FARNBOROUGH AIR SHOW'S ABOUT TO BEGIN THE WORLD THIS MORNING ANYWAY AND WE JOIN OUR BUSINESS PRESENTER DOMINIC O'CONNELL COS THEY DO A LOT OF BUSINESS
# THEY CERTAINLY DO DON'T THEY CERTAINLY DO AND THE SUN HAS COME OUT THE FIRST GUESTS ARE JUST ARRIVING AT THE CAR PARK AND WALKING UP THE HILL INTO THE CHALET IT'S A BIG EVENT THE BIGGEST EVENT REALLY FOR THE END FOR THE DEFENCE IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES THE BIGGER BIT ON THE CALENDAR FOR THE YEAR PEOPLE COME HERE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO DO BUSINESS IN THERE'LL BE ONE TELL THE CONVERSATION I CAN GUARANTEE YOU
WHAT DOES BRITAIN'S VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION MEAN FOR THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY A LOT OF THE AIRCRAFT HERE THAT ON THE SPELL BE FLYING LATER TODAY AT THE PRODUCT OF INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS COLLABORATIONS OFTEN WITH EUROPEAN PARTNERS I ASKED IAN KING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF B.A.E. SYSTEMS OUR BIGGEST DEFENCE CONTRACTOR WHAT IT ALL MEANT FOR BRITISH BUSINESS
I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IT DOES BECAUSE WE DON'T TRADE WITH THE E.U. AS A DEFENCE ENTITY IT'S WITHIN VIGIL NATIONS AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE U.K. GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TAKE HIS FOOT OFF THE PEDAL IN TERMS OF DEFENCE AND SECURITY AND ITS PRIMARY ROLE WHICH IS THE DEFENCE OF THE OF THE NATION ADDICTED SERVES I THINK THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WILL ENDURED AND THEY WILL ENDURE BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE ARMED FORCES THAT WE HAVE AND THE QUALITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND CAPABILITIES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR INDUSTRY
I'M JOINED BY WARREN EAST TO CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ROLLS ROYCE TO BIG HERO IN JAMAICA POWS MAINLY THE AIRCRAFT ON DISPLAY HERE WARREN WHAT DID YOU TAKE FOR THE BRICKS HAVE VOTED YOU IN KING THERE IS A BIT IS IT A BIG DEAL FOR YOUR COMPANY WELL OF COURSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT WE JUST HAVE TO GET ON WITH IT IF YOU LOOK AT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO THEN PROBABLY THREE QUARTERS OF THAT IS COMING FROM OUTSIDE OF THE E.U.
AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT GLOBAL VIEW WHATEVER'S HAPPENED WITH WITH A VOTE FOR BRECHT'S IT IT'S HAPPENED AND WE NEED TO MOVE ON ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES OF THE CAMPAIGN WAS THAT ROLLS ROYCE SAID QUITE CLEARLY THEY HAVE BEEN
THEY WANT BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT DERBY WHERE YOU'RE BASED AND IT'S THE SPIRITUAL HOME OF ROLLS ROYCE FOR FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS
VOTED TO LEAVE DO YOU THINK PEOPLE JUST IGNORED WHAT ROLLS ROYCE IT OR WHAT BUSINESS
OR THAT THEY ALL THAT THEY MADE THE CONNECTION AND DECIDEDLY SOMETHING ELSE ANYWAY WELL PEOPLE HAD TO MAKE THEIR OWN MINDS UP IT WAS A PERSONAL MATTER AND HOW DERBYS IT HAS A POPULATION OF ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION PEOPLE AND WE EMPLOY ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND A LOT MORE PEOPLE IN DERBY THAN IN BOWLS WERE THEN ROLLS ROYCE AND EVEN WITHIN ROLLS ROYCE THEN PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS JUST LIKE THEY DID IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
ABSOLUTELY THE BUT PILOT BUT PART OF THIS WHAT WE SEE HERE TODAY IS ALL ABOUT COLLABORATION AND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION EUROPEAN PARTNERSHIP
BRICKS IT GIVE YOU ANY OPPORTUNITY SEE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE PERHAPS NO I THINK PRETTY MUCH AS WE AS WE JUST HEAR THE IAN FROM FROM B.A. TALK TALKING ABOUT
WE DO BUSINESS WITH DIFFERENT COMPANIES WHEREVER THEY HAPPENED TO BE WHERE TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS WE COLLABORATE WITH TECHNOLOGY LEADERS AND PRODUCE GREAT GREAT PRODUCT IT WOULD BE A BLOW WHEN YOU'VE GOT BIG OPERATIONS IN GERMANY WOULD BE A BLOW IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE BETWEEN THOSE TWO HEADQUARTERS IN INDEED WE DO AND WE DO THINK THAT ABILITY IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US AS
OTHER THINGS ARE IMPORTANT LIKE THE DETAIL OF THE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENT SECTOR TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT GET STRUCK OVER THE OVER THE COMING YEARS ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AEROSPACE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HOW THAT INVOLVES ITS ALL IMPORTANT BUT WE NEED TO WE NEED TO WORK WITHIN THOSE LIMITS AND FIND CREATIVE WAYS OF GETTING AROUND WHATEVER PROBLEMS COME AWAY
FARMERS WHAT ABOUT DEALS AND YOU'VE BEEN VERY QUICK OUT OF THE BLOCKS YOU'VE GOT ONE ALREADY A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUND ODD ODD A DEAL TO BUY A SPANISH PARTNER YOU ALREADY OWN QUITE A LOT OF THE KEY TELL US I.T. PEA IT'S CALLED YEAH STATE THEY MAKE HIGH VALUE COMPONENTS THAT GO IN OUR ENGINES WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OR SO AND THIS DEAL'S GOING TO ENABLE US TO CAPTURE MORE OF THAT VALUE FOR ROLLS ROYCE IN FUTURE

# THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SEVEN TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND ROB BONNET'S BACK WITH THE SWAP THEY SARAH SO ANDY MURRAY HAS HIS SECOND WIMBLEDON TITLE ACHIEVED YESTERDAY ON CENTRE COURT IN STRAIGHT SETS AGAINST CANADA'S MIDDLE SURROUNDED SHOULDN'T RUN IF YOU'RE WATCHING ON T.V. YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE SEEN HIS COACH IVAN LENDL BREAK INTO SOMETHING APPROXIMATING TO ASSIST HER TO HER SMILE AT LITTLE'S BEEN BACK WITH MURRAY FOR JUST OVER A MONTH AND SAYS HE'D LIKE TO BE THERE AGAIN NEXT YEAR DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MURRAY WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT
SHE'S A LEADER THAT'S IMPORTANT I TRUST AND WHAT HE DOES I JUST LIKE THAT HE'S VERY HONEST WITH ME IN THE TEAM HE SAYS EXACTLY WHAT HE THINKS I DON'T
YOU DON'T ALWAYS LIKE BUT IT IS OFF KNOW WHAT I NEED TO HEAR AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE WORKED EXTREMELY WELL TOGETHER AND WE DO WORK FOR ME AND SAID TO OUR CORRESPONDENT RUSSELL FOR THEIR MORNING RUSSEL HOW MURRAY SAYS IT'S BEST TENNIS IS AHEAD OF HIM SO I WONDER HOW MUCH THAT MIGHT DEPEND ON LENTIL STAYING IN HIS CORNER
I THINK MENDEL IN MANY WAYS IS THE FINAL PART OF THE JIGSAW ROB THE TIMING HE'S RETURNED TO THE TEAM WAS IMMACULATE AFTER THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF LOSING TO NOVAK DJOKOVIC IN THE FRENCH OPEN FINAL LENTIL RETURNED AND BECAUSE OF THEIR SUCCESS IN THE PAST GIVES MURRAY ENORMOUS CONFIDENCE HE TRUSTS HIM IMPLICITLY BUT MURRAY HAD BEEN PLAYING SOME FANTASTIC TENNIS FOR A WHILE HE HAS A FABULOUS WIDER SUPPORT TEAM AND HE PEAKED
FOR TWO WEEKS HERE AT WIMBLEDON HE PLAYED SUPERBLY IN MELBOURNE AND IN PARIS TO FINISHED RUNNER UP IN THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN IN THE FRENCH OPEN BUT NO QUESTION ABOUT IT HE WAS THE SUPREME PLAYER OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND HE HAS A CHANCE TO WIN MORE GRAND SLAMS IN THE FUTURE HE'S ONLY JUST TURNED TWENTY NINE FOR TENNIS PLAYER THESE DAYS JUST COMING INTO PEAK FORM HERE FEELING THAT TAKES ME IN A SENSE MY NEXT OBSERVATION DOC OF IXION FEDERER UNEXPECTEDLY REMOVED FOR CAUTION THE TOURNAMENT BY OTHERS BUT IT IS TEMPTING TO BELIEVE THAT BUT CURRENT FORM WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM TO THE VICTORY YESTERDAY ANYWAY
ABSOLUTELY ME LOST ROUND EACH BEAT ROGER FEDERER WHO HAD A FANTASTIC COUPLE OF WEEKS WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW LITTLE TENNIS IS PLAYED AND THE FACT THAT HE'S APPROACHING HIS THIRTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY I THINK MURRAY WOULD HAVE BEATEN FEDERER REASONABLY CONVINCINGLY IN A FINAL AND AS FOR NOVAK DJOKOVIC ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT A GRAND SLAM CHAMPIONSHIPS
IDENTIFIES THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD IN A GIVEN FORTNIGHT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION THAT OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS ANDY MURRAY WAS THAT PLAYER YES FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TALKING MURRAY WON'T HE WITH THE DAVIS CUP CAPTAIN LEON SMITH ABOUT TAKING PART IN THAT QUARTER FINAL TIE THIS WEEKEND
IN SERBIA DOCKING WHICH ABSENCE FROM THAT BUT WHAT'S YOUR HUNCH ABOUT MURRAY
MY HUNCH IS HE WILL NOT PLAY HE SAYS HE WANTS TO ENJOY THIS WIMBLEDON TRIUMPH IT'LL BE DIFFICULT TO DO SO IF HE JUMPS ON A PLANE TO BELGRADE TO PLAY IN THE QUARTER FINAL TOMORROW I THINK ALSO HE NEEDS TO BE FAIRLY RUTHLESS THE OLYMPIC STARTING IN WEEKS THAT'S A BIG TARGET IN SINGLES AND DOUBLES AND THE U.S. OPEN TWO WEEKS AFTER THE OLYMPICS FINISHED IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE TO PLAY ALL OF THOSE EVENTS AND NOT LET YOUR CHANCES LATER ON IN THE SEASON SUFFER FELT LIKE YOUR OWN ANSWER FOR THAT QUESTION IS PROBABLY NO RUSSELL FULLER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WERE LEWIS HAMILTON
FOURTH WIN THE BRITISH GRAND PRIX PROMPT AND PROMPTED HIM TO SAY THAT IT WAS THE BEST RACE IN THE WORLD HE'S NOW JUST ONE DRIVERS' CHAMPIONSHIP POINT BEHIND MERCEDES TEAM MATE AND RIVAL NICO ROSBERG WHO IS DEMOTED TO THIRD PLACE AFTER TEN SECOND PENALTY FOR ILLEGAL RADIO FEEDBACK MORE ON THAT IN AN HOUR BUT FOR PORTUGAL A ONE NIL WIN FOOTBALL'S EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL AGAINST FRANCE IN PARIS THE GOAL IN EXTRA TIME FROM ED THERE ARE BIGGER TOURNAMENT BUT NOT NECESSARILY ACCOMPANIED BY AN IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY ACCORDING TO OUR CORRESPONDENT JOHN MURRAY
THIS WAS THE FIRST TWENTY FOURTEEN EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP AND IT WAS WON BY YOUR SIDE THEY'D ONLY JUST AVOIDED GOING OUT AT THE GROUP STAGE WHO IN FACT WOULDN'T ONLY ONE MATCH IN NINETY MINUTES THAT WAS AGAINST WALES IN THE SEMI FINALS AND THE TOURNAMENT PROVIDED MEMORIES TO LAST A LIFETIME FOR THEM
NORTHERN IRELAND AND FOR TEAM SUCH AS ICELAND HUNGARY AND ALBANIA AND IT DID THE SAME TOO FOR THE FIRST TIME CHAMPIONS PORTUGAL BUT THERE IS AN INESCAPABLE FEELING THAT THE QUALITY OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP IT'S BEEN DILUTED IN ORDER TO BROADEN ITS APPEAL WHICH TAKES US TO OUR RACING TIPS FOR TODAY WINDSOR EIGHT O'CLOCK NUMBER FIVE CUPPA DIEM LADY

DESPERATE TO PROVIDE IT TRY TELLING THAT TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE NEED TO GET INTO LONDON EVERY DAY TO DO THEIR JOBS BUT HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME OF IT BECAUSE SOUTHERN RAIL WHO RUN THE SERVICE KEEP CANCELLING TRAINS IN FACT TODAY AS WE JUST HEARD ON THE NEWS THEY WILL BE DEMONSTRATING BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF SERVICES HAVE SIMPLY BEEN REMOVED FROM THE TIMETABLE WILL ONE OF THOSE PROTESTERS ONE OF THOSE COMMUTERS SET OFF ON HIS JOURNEY OF THE LAST HALF HOUR

BETWEEN CANCELLATIONS DELAYS AND SHORT FORMATIONS IT'S BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET TO WORK AND BACK RELIABLY
I'M FRUSTRATED WITH SOFTEN HAVE CAUSED BY MAINLY FRUSTRATED WITH THE GOVERNMENT THEY SEEM TO HAVE DECIDED THAT SOUTHERN AND THEIR PARENT COMPANY THE GO AHEAD GROUP ARE TOO BIG TO FAIL WHEN WE COMPLAIN TO SOUTHERN WE GET TOLD THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT GOVERNMENT AUTHORISATION WHEN WE COMPLAIN TO THE GOVERNMENT WE'RE TOLD HE'S THE TRAIN OPERATORS RESPONSIBILITY
COMMUTERS KNOW WHAT THEY WANT WE WANT MEANING FOR COMPENSATION NOT JUST DELAY WE PLAY WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE TICKETS ACROSS THE NETWORK WITHOUT RESTRICTION WE WANT TRAINS DECLASSIFIED SO WE STAND A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING A SEAT MOST OF ALL WE DESPERATELY NEED A REVIEW OF THE G.T. A FRANCHISE AGREEMENT EITHER TO GIVE IT SOME TEETH WHAT A KICK SOUTHERN OUT AND GET SOME PEOPLE IN WHO CAN RUN THE RAILWAY
WELL I BETTER SEE IF I CAN DO THAT TODAY AND GET ME TO WORK
WELL GOOD LUCK TO HIM THAT WAS ALEX PROSSER SNARLING AND I'M JOINED BY THE PERSON WHO CAN ANSWER ALL THOSE QUESTIONS FOR HIM AND WILL THAT IS THE REAL MINISTER CLAIRE PERRY GOOD MORNING WHAT INTO NOW IS IT RIGHT THAT YOU'RE SCARED THEY'RE TOO BIG TO FAIL THE COMPANY THAT OWN SOUTHERN RAIL

FOR DECADES IT'S BEEN UNDER INVESTED IN PEOPLE ARE TRAVELLING ON OLD TRACK ON OLD TRAINS THROUGH STATIONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN MODERNISED AND SO THE THAMES LINK PROGRAMME IT WAS PUT IN PLACE
WORK A FEW YEARS AGO WILL BE COMPLETED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALMOST SEVEN BILLION POUNDS OF SPENDING ON ON THIS ENTIRE NETWORK WILL DELIVER A MUCH BETTER SERVICE AND OF COURSE WELL BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THOSE WORKS COME TO AT ANOTHER TWO YEARS TO WADE OF THIS MISERY YOU NO BEING ABLE TO GET IN WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS IT WAS QUITE CLEAR WHEN I BECAME MINISTER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT ACTUALLY AT THE THINKING BEHIND THE LEVEL OF DISRUPTION WHEN YOU'RE DOING A MAJOR ENGINEERING PROJECT ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO CUSTOMERS TRAVELLING TODAY
WAS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH AND THEY ME THEY DIDN'T DO THEIR JOB WELL ACTUALLY I THINK THERE WERE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT MAJOR ENGINEERING WORKS ON A VERY BUSY PART OF THEY DID NOT DO THE JOB I THINK THAT'S THE REALITY ISN'T IT COLLECTIVELY BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT NETWORK RAIL AND THE OPERATOR SO YOUR LOTS AND DO THE JOY I THINK LET WELL CAN I JUST POINT OUT THAT ACTUALLY CUSTOMERS DON'T ACTUALLY CARE WHOSE FAULT IT IS I CAN TELL OH THEY DO BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PUT RIGHT AND UNLESS YOU KNOW WHOSE FAULT IT IS HOW DO YOU PUT IT RIGHT ON WHAT THEY SAY IS VERY SIMPLE
GET RID OF THESE PEOPLE THEN WERE RUNNING CHARLIE TRY NOT JUST SOMEBODY ELSE TO BE TRY AND ANSWER ONE QUESTION JOHN SOAKED SO SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE FAILURES WE'VE SEEN ON THIS LINE ARE A RESULT OF THE TRACK ALL RIGHT INVESTMENT GOING IN THAT'S NOT ANYTHING THE FRANCHISE OWNER CAN CONTROL WHAT THE FRANCHISE OPERATOR CAN CONTROL IS THE PUNCTUALITY OF TRAINS THEY'RE ACTUALLY RUNNING WHEN THERE ARE DELAYS AND THE STAFF THEY'VE GOT ON BOARD AND I HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSELY INVOLVED IN THIS WORK TRYING TO JOIN IT ALL UP AND BY APRIL OF THIS YEAR AS ALEX SAID
THINGS WERE SWEAR O.K. WE WERE LOOKING ABOUT SHOT IT'S GONE INTO MELT OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS IN APRIL WE HAD A RELIABILITY RATE OF ABOUT EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT NOT GOOD ENOUGH I'LL BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT BUT SINCE THEN WE HAVE SEEN BOTH BUT PLANNED UNPLANNED INDUSTRIAL ACTION ARE JUST MEN THERE IS NO CERTAINTY ABOUT THE SERVICES AND IT'S JUST BEEN AS ALEX SAID ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL SO REALLY TRYING TO DIG THROUGH WHAT PROMISE I PROMISE L.A. THAT WE'RE INTRODUCING NEW TRAINS RIGHT ACROSS THIS NETWORK BRAND NEW TRAIN STATE OF THE ART AND INSTEAD OF
THE CONDUCTOR OPERATING THE DOORS THE DRIVER OPERATES THE DOORS WERE SOME OF THE UNION BOSSES HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT RIGHT THE SECOND THING IS IF I MAY COMPANY'S INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS HANDLING HAS NOT BEEN GOOD AND SO YOU'VE HAD THE COMPANY IN THE UNION BASICALLY IN A STAND OFF AVERY DRIED SO THAT SO THE COMPANY HAS MADE A MESS OF IT EFFECTIVELY THAT'S PRETTY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING NO I'M SAYING THAT COLLECTIVELY THE SYSTEM HAS NOT DELIVERED FOR CUSTOMERS SO WHAT DO WE WRITE THAT THE CUSTOMERS AREN'T INTERESTED IN ALL THAT SORT OF JARGON WE HAVEN'T DELIVERED FOR THE CUSTOMERS AND THEY CANNOT THESE PEOPLE A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CANNOT GET TO WORK
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS ASKING YOU WILL YOU REVIEW THE FRANCHISE GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE PERHAPS LET THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT TAKEN OVER AS THEY I HAVE NO IDEOLOGICAL ADDICTION TO PUT IT RIGHT SO ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT IF I WERE A SO MUCH LET ME LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION IF I WAS TO SAY TODAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S GOT AROUND THE FRANCHISE WOULD ANYTHING CHANGE WE HAVE GOT A REAL WEIRD WITH EASTERN REAL SAME WELL ACTUALLY DIDN'T SAY MANAGEMENT TEAM CAME IN HOUSE AROUND THEIR FRANCHISE
WELL AS WE'VE PROVEN PROBLEMS WE'VE GOT ARE A MAJOR AMOUNT OF ENGINEERING WORKS AND A WHOLE SERIES OF INDUSTRIAL ACTIONS BOTH OF WHICH WOULD CONTINUE REGARDLESS OF HIS NAME'S ON THE DOOR SO WE HAVE GOT TO GET THE COMPANY AND THE UNIONS TO SORT OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES ARE BY THE WAY TODAY WHAT I'VE GOT EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING TODAY TO TO THE UNIONS IS I UNDERSTAND
THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY FEEL THAT CHANGING THIS ONBOARD ROLL NOBODY LOSES THEIR SECOND ON BOARD STAFF MEMBER COULD BE SEEN AS THE THIN END OF THE WEDGE I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S NERVOUSNESS ABOUT THAT AND SO WE WILL CHARON GUARANTEE THAT ROLE IN THIS AND FUTURE I KNOW WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THAT RULE YOU MEAN EVEN IF THEY GET RID OF THE GUARD AS IT WERE TO USE AN OLD FASHIONED TERM EVEN IF THEY GET RID OF THE GUARD THERE WILL STILL BE THAT OTHER PERSON ON THE TRAINS AND THAT PERSON WILL HAVE NO CHANGE IN CONDITIONS THEY WILL REMAIN IF THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO
HELP PASSENGERS ON THE TRAIN MORE BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAPPY WITH THAT COS THEY'D HAVE TO PAY THEIR WAY BY WEALTHY AND THAT HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY PART OF THE PLANT THERE HAVE BEEN NO JOB LOSSES NO DE SKIN SO IN THAT CASE WHY HAVEN'T THE UNIONS CALLED OFF WELL IT'S INDUSTRIAL ISLAND THESE GOING SICK AND I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THAT QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THE QUESTION TO MAKE CASH AND I THINK WE HAVE MADE AND OFTEN RUNS THE UNION AND THIS IS THE POINT I DO WITH THIS IS HAPPENING IN SCOTLAND TOO IT'S NOT JUST HAPPENING IN THE SOUTH EAST IT'S HAPPENING IN SCOTLAND OVER THE EXACTLY THE SAME DISPUTE TRYING TO STOP THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW TRAY WHICH IS ACKNOWLEDGED HAVEN'T YOU THE COURSE LAST FEUMAIL
BUT THE COMPANY ITSELF HAS NOT BEEN COMPETENT IT HASN'T RUN THE RAILWAY I AS WELL AS WELL I THINK ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE RUNNING THE DAY TO DAY SERVICES ARE AMONGST THE BEST WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COMPANY YOUR OWN WELL ULTIMATELY WANT THE BEST PEOPLE RUNNING THE RAILWAY FOR THE BENEFIT OF PASSENGERS BUT I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES AROUND THE INDUSTRIAL HANDLING OF IT HAVING INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES IN THIS CASE AND I ALSO THINK YOU'D NEED TO MAKE IT HATCHES A PUNISHING THEM WELL THEY HAVE
THEY HAVE WITH THEIR WE'VE CONTRACTED WITH THEM AND AGAIN THIS IS THE STRUCTURE OF CONTRACT IT'S WAY UP THERE MIGHT BE TOO MUCH DETAIL FOR PEOPLE TRYING DON'T OVERSTEER ON THE STRETCHER WE DON'T HISTORICALLY WE HAVEN'T CONTRACTED FOR A FORD THERE
PUNCTUALITY OF THE TRAINS PARTLY BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED NETWORK RAIL HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON PUNCTUALITY AND THE COMPANY CAN'T CONTROL THAT BUT IT'S BEEN QUITE CLEAR TO ME THAT COMPANIES WHO CANNOT DELIVER A GOOD SERVICE PARTICULARLY OVER THE THINGS THEY CAN CONTROL SHOULD NOT BE BIDDING FOR NEW FRANCHISES AND WE KNOW WE NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT THAT AT LEAST SO THEY WON'T BE TAKING ON ANY MORE FRENCH WELL WE NEED TO HAVE A SERIOUS QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCE GOING FORWARD BUT CAN I JUST SAY ON THE EMERGENCY
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF TRAINS WILL RUN THIS PLAID THAT MEANS PEOPLE CAN NOW HAVE SOME CERTAINTY ABLE TO TRAIN THEY WANT TO TAKE HOME TO OR TO WORK AND THIS WILL CONTINUE FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND I HOPE THAT THE UNIONS WILL WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE SIT DOWN WITH THE COMPANY AND SORT OUT THIS DISPUTE CLAIRE PERRY THANKS A LOT
# IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TAKING A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND MOST BELIEVE ANDY MURRAY'S GIVEN A DIVIDED COUNTRY A MUCH NEEDED LIFT AT LAST SOMETHING FOR THE WHOLE NATION TO CHEER SAYS THE TELEGRAPH ALONGSIDE A PICTURE OF THE WIMBLEDON CHAMPION HOLDING THE TROPHY THE TIMES DEVELOPS THE THEME SAYING IT WAS AS IF IN THIS SUMMER OF DISCOMBOBULATION THERE WAS A NEED FOR SOMETHING UNIFYING IT PRAISES MURRAY FOR HIS ARTISTRY AND RUTHLESSNESS ON COURT AND ARGUES HE NOW STANDS
THE WORLD'S PANTHEON STRIKES MAX HASTINGS AT THE MAIL A JOYOUS EXCUSE TO WAVE THE UNION FLAG FROM START TO FINISH HE SAYS MURRAY LOOK LIKE THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO WIN THOSE COATED LENTIL NEVER LOST HIS DEFAULT EXPRESSION OF A PUBLIC HANGMEN WITH TOOTHACHE THE CONFIDENT WAY IN WHICH MARRIED TOOK A PART HIS OPPONENT IS PRAISED BY THE TELEGRAPH JIM WHITE FOR YEARS HE SAYS IF WE SAW TENNIS PLAYER UTTERLY CONFOUNDED WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH HE HAD TO DO TO BEAT THE GENIUS CONFRONTING
IT WAS A BRITON SHAKING HIS HEAD IN DESPAIR HERE IT WAS A BRITAIN DOING THE CONFOUNDING YOU CALLS FOR MONEY TO BE KNIGHTED THE INTENDED ARGUES THE EYE RATHER ARGUES HE'S STAKED A CLAIM AS BRITAIN'S GREATEST EVER SPORTING STAR
# IN THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE REIGN OF RAP AND ROGER FEDERER IS LONG GONE MORAY HAS BECOME THE CHIEF CHALLENGER FOR THE WORLD NUMBER ONE NOVAK DJOKOVIC THE TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH ANDREA LEAD SOME E'S APOLOGY TO THERESA MAY FOR APPEARING TO SUGGEST THAT BEING A MOTHER MADE HER BETTER PLACE TO BE PRIME MINISTER MISSUS LED SOME TELLS THE TELEGRAPHS ALLISON PEARSON THAT SHE'S BEEN GUILTY OF NAIVETY AND HER HANDLING OF THE INTERVIEW WHICH LED TO THE FOR OR THE ECONOMIST WRITES THAT THIS LOVELY SPARKY WOMAN SOUNDED LIKE THE LIFE FORCE HAD BEEN DRAINED OUT OF HER
# THE GUARDIAN LEADS WITH A STORY THAT SAYS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING STEPS TO CHANGE THEIR GENDER HAS RISEN DRAMATICALLY DURING THE PAST DECADE THE STORIES BASED ON INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM BRITAIN'S FOURTEEN GENDER IDENTITY CLINICS CALLED THE GUARDIAN THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND PUT AN ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION POUNDS TOWARDS THE SERVICES LAST YEAR BUT IT SAYS THE WAITING TIME FOR HER FIRST APPOINTMENT IS NOW ABOUT NINE MONTHS WITH CAMPAIGNERS WARNING THAT THOSE SEEKING HELP OR MORE LIKELY TO KILL THEMSELVES THAN THE REST OF THE POPULATION
# SIXTY MINUTES TO EIGHT SPEECHES ARGUMENT DEBATE IT'S THE WAY POLITICIANS ENGAGE WITH THE WORLD BUT IT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO LISTEN TO THE WELCOME COLLECTION'S BEEN STAGING A PROJECT THAT'S TEACHING PEOPLE A LANGUAGE WITHOUT WORDS THE AIM TO SHOW HOW SPEECH AND MUSIC ARE LINKED
RESEARCH AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY IS REVEALING HOW CONVERSATION THAT ENGAGES PEOPLE HAS MUSICAL RHYTHMS AND THAT AS SOON AS WE'RE FORCED TO LISTEN TO LECTURES SPEECHES OR OTHER PEOPLE'S ARGUMENTS THE MUSIC DIES AND WE BEGIN TO TURN OFF DAVID SILLITOE REPORTS
THE NEW SUN SILENCE THE SOUND THE SOUND OF SILENCE THAT MAY BE MY FAULT I MAY WE DO HAVE DAVID SAID
HE ALTOGETHER NOW AYE AYE I WILL
WE WERE SITTING IN A LITTLE SEMI CIRCLE WITH AN ARTIST EMMA SMITH THAT THIS IS HER VOICE HER WELCOME COLLECTION OF VERY AND SHE WAS TEACHING AS A NEW LANGUAGE NO WORDS JUST SO CENTRE AS WE BEGAN TO REPEAT OUR NONSENSE PRAISES TOGETHER IT STARTED TO SOUND ODDLY MUSICAL
AND WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION YOU MOVE THIS IS DAD OUT JOSIE WE STARTED TO HEAR A RIVER
ONLY BY A RHYTHM THAT THEY REALISED ME BAD DAY TO DAY TRIP CHAT BECAUSE WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR QUITE A WHILE I THINK YOUR VOICE KIND OF CHANGES TO BE SIMILAR IF THAT MAKES SENSE SO WHEN YOU'RE USED TO BEING AROUND SOMEONE
YOUR VOICE CHANGES TO KIND OF SEE A WEDGE BOTH COME TOGETHER QUITE BIRDS YET SO IT'S THERE IT'S THERE STRAIGHTAWAY WHO'S THAT THERE ISN'T A BIT OF THE BEAT
AND LISTENING TO THE RECORDING OF THE CONVERSATION WAS A LANGUAGE ARTIST EMMA SMITH AND IAN CROSS PROFESSOR OF MUSIC AND SCIENCE AT WILSON COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE THERE IS A TENDENCY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THINK THAT CONVERSATIONS ALL RIGHT ME YOU ME YOU
BUT ACTUALLY JUST AS WAS HAPPENING PRECISELY HERE THEY'RE NOT JUST SONS
THEIR SONS AND INTERJECTIONS LIKE O. O. KAY IT'S WHAT WE DO WHEN THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP AND WEAR AND SIDE R.T. WITH EACH OTHER AND HIS AGREEMENT AND THAT'S WHEN IT STARTS TO COME OUT
I'M GUESSING THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A REVELATION OF COURSE CONVERSATIONS FILLED WITH GESTURES AND SOUNDS THAT AREN'T QUITE
BUT HOW MANY OF US THINK OF THEIR RHYTHM AND THE BEAT OF A CONVERSATION WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES GETTING ON WITH SOMEONE WE MAY NOT REMEMBER WHAT WE SAY BUT WHEN THERE'S A SHIP'S YEARS' WORK WITH THE TO AND FRO OF THE WORDS WE SEEMED TO CLICK
EQUALLY CHIT CHAT
PROFESSOR CRUST THINKS IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE YOU SUPPORT WE HYPOTHESISE AND SUSPECT IS THAT THE SAME PROCESSES WONDERING LIKE MUSIC AS IN DIRECTION AS UNDERLIES SPEECH AS A DIRECTION AND WE TYPICALLY DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS WHAT WE DO
AND THIS THEY THINK HAS DEEP ROOTS LISTEN TO THIS THE POLYPHONIC COMMUNICATION OF THE BARK OR PAPER
CONVERSATION IT'S THOUGHT IS STRONGLY LINKED TO COULSON TAKE AWAY THE INTERACTIONS IN LECTURES MONOLOGUES OR AN ARGUMENT ON THE RADIO
MUSIC DIETS HE'S PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE THAT SINGING TOGETHER IN A CHOIR LEADS TO A VERY STRONG ENHANCED SENSE OF MUTUAL AFFILIATION BUT THIS IS ANOTHER THING WINKING LOOK AT IS WHAT THAT SINGING INTERACTION IS HOW YOU CREATE THIS KIND OF INTERLOCKING MUSICAL PROCESS WILL VOTE IF I BRING THROUGH ONE OF THE BATTLE OF HORNS
WE COULD DO SOME INTERLOCKING STUFF YEP SURE IAN AND EMMA TOOK OUT THEIR PARLOPHONE I SORT OF AFRICAN XYLOPHONE TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE PLAYING TOGETHER
BUT ONCE THEY GET INTO MUSICAL SINK IT'S MY PLEASURE IT'S THE TO AND FRO WOULD BE GETTING ON
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THINKING ABOUT THIS RELATION TO WHAT YOU MIGHT HEAR ON THE RADIO WHERE EVERYONE SUDDENLY GOES AND SOME OTHER MODE WHEN YOU ALL TURNED TAKING RATHER THAN THAT NATURAL FORM OF CONVERSATION THEY WERE DOING ALL THE TIME SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE GETTING ON THEIR SPEECH PATTERNS
MIRROR ONE ANOTHER THERE WAS A STUDY THAT LOOKED BUT PLATER'S BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AND HE FIND THAT THOSE WHO CONVERTS MOVED WITH THEIR VOCAL PRODUCTIONS OF THE JUDGES BEFORE THEM THEY WERE PLEADING WERE MORE LIKELY TO GET JUDGEMENTS IN THERE FOR EVER IF YOU WANT PEOPLE
TO LIKE YOU OR DO YOU GET ON WITH YOU BEWARE OF YOUR MUSICALITY THEN I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING SO MANIPULATIVE AND FRIENDLY BUT PEOPLE DO TRY MANIPULATIVE LIKE POLITICIANS SOMETIMES TO THE REGULARITIES THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO DRAW PEOPLE THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE YOU LIKE
AND USUALLY IT'S PLONKING COULD'VE HIS PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE EFFECT WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THIS VERY REGULAR WEAR THEM COS IT'S A BIT TOO BORING RATION ANYWAY PEOPLE WON'T LISTEN ALL THE PROBLEM ALSO IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER IT YOU CAN SEE QUITE CLEARLY MANY U.K. POLITICIANS JUST AIN'T GOT MORE OF A FRIENDLY CONVERSATION AGREEMENTS
AS THE GREATEST MUSICALITY LOOKED ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO DISCORD ON IT I LIKE THAT WAS DAVID CILLA'S YOU'RE THERE IT IS NOW TEN TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT WITH HER BEING WITH US THIS MORNING IS THE WRITER RHIDIAN BROOK ARE MORNING GOOD MORNING
# THE RADIO IS ON IN THE BACKGROUND AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HER LEADERSHIP ELECTION GETTING UGLY AND YOU HALF LISTEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN UNIMPORTANT EVENT BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED DIGESTING THE DIGESTED VERSIONS OF CHILCOTT TWO POINT SIX MILLION WORDS IN ORDER TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS WHAT AND WHO TO BLAME BUT THERE'S ANOTHER LEADERSHIP CONTEST BEING ANNOUNCE PLUS A BIG ARTICLE ABOUT RACIAL PROBLEMS IN AMERICA TO READ AND YOU OUGHT TO WATCH THE INTERVIEW WITH THE PERSON WHO MIGHT BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER SO YOU DO THAT WHILE SIFTING THROUGH ALL THE TWEETS AND POSTS ABOUT BRICKS
AFTER A WHILE YOU FEEL YOU'VE ABSORBED A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT LEARN NOTHING AND YOU FEEL ANGRY OR ANXIOUS OR CONFUSE SO INSTEAD YOU WATCH MURRAY WHEN WIMBLEDON OR THE ENTIRE SEASON FIVE OF THE WALKING DEAD AND LET THE CONSOLATIONS OF SPORT OF THE FICTIONAL PROBLEMS OF A POST APOCALYPTIC WORLD TAKE YOUR MIND OFF IT ALL
THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES THESE LAST FEW WEEKS WHEN IT'S BEEN HARD TO KEEP UP WITH THE NEWS EVEN EMBARRASSED OUTLINE THE SPEED THE MOMENTOUS NAS THE CLAMOUR OF IT AND THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WE HAVE TO PROCESS LET ALONE UNDERSTAND IT ALL INCREASES THE SENSE OF FEELING OVERWHELMED
SOMEONE RECENTLY ASKED IS BRITAIN ABOUT TO DIE OF NEWS IT'S EVEN BEEN SUGGESTED THE NEWS IS BAD FOR US BUT RATHER THAN INFORMING US IT INHIBITS THINKING MAKES AS PASSIVE AND INDIFFERENT TO THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS WHILST REAFFIRMING ELSIE IN OUR EXISTING PREJUDICES ADD TO THAT THE PROBLEM OF THE NEWS ITSELF BEING DISTORTED OR MISREPORTED AND IT'S TEMPTED TO IGNORE IT ALL FOR GOOD
BUT I'M NOT SURE WITHDRAWAL IS THE ANSWER IT'S OFTEN WHEN EVENTS ARE AT THEIR MOST CONFUSING AND TROUBLING THAT WE NEED TO ENGAGE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEM BETTER
THE CHALLENGE FOR US SEEMS TO BE HOW DO WE STAY INFORMED ABOUT THE ISSUES OF THE DAY WITHOUT BEING OVERWHELMED OR PARALYSED BY THEM HOW DO WE SEE CLEARLY THROUGH THE FOREST OF WORDS AND FLASHING OF IMAGES TO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON WITHOUT FIRST BEING BLINDED AND THEN JADED
WE DON'T WANT TO BECOME THE KIND OF NATION DESCRIBED IN DEUTERONOMY A NATION WITHOUT SENSE WHERE THERE IS NO DISCERNMENT AND IF THERE'S A QUALITY THAT CONSUMERS DELIVERERS AND MAKERS OF GNUS NEED IT'S THE GIFT OF DISCERNMENT THE SOUND JUDGEMENT THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO TELL GOOD FROM BAD RECOGNISE TRUTH AND INTEGRITY AND THAT MAKES FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE
IT CAN HELP US IN THE WAY WE RESPOND TO NEWS AT THE TIME WE TAKE TO CONSIDERATE WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT AND TO SEE WHAT IS IMPORTANT
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD STAY ENGAGED IN ORDER TO BE WHAT SCRIPTURE ENCOURAGES US TO BE A PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE TIMES THEY'RE LIVING IN SO THAT THEY CAN KNOW BEST WHAT TO DO AND DISCERN WHAT THE END WILL BE
# AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH RHYDIAN BOOK THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT AT LAST SOMETHING FOR THE WHOLE NATION TO CHEER THAT'S HOW ONE OF THE PAPERS SUMS UP ANDY MURRAY'S VICTORY AT WIMBLEDON YESTERDAY BUT IT WASN'T THE ONLY BRITISH WIN IN A REMARKABLE WEEKEND FOR U.K. SPORT WITH ONE OF HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL LADIES IN HIS CAREER CHRIS

OR ABOUT TO GET A NEW LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION MAYBE THERE WILL BE CHOSEN BY THIS IS WHERE IT GETS A BIT COMPLICATED THE EXISTING LEADER JEREMY CORBIN WAS CHOSEN BY MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY TEN MONTHS AGO BUT MOST LABOUR M.P.S WANT TO TURF HIM OUT AND STOP HIM RUNNING AGAIN BECAUSE IF HE DID
HE PROBABLY WON'T AGAIN ONE OF THOSE M.P.S AS HARRIET HARMAN FORMER DEPUTY LEADER OF THE PARTY WE WERE HOPING TO SPEAK TO HER PERHAPS RULE WILL LATER IN THE PROGRAMME SHE WANTS ANGELA EAGLE TO TAKE OVER FROM MISTER CORBIN THE OTHER IS DIANE ABBOTT WHO WANTS MY ACCORDING TO HANG ON IN THERE AND HE WAS WITH ME IN THE STUDIO BUT LET'S GO FIRST TO LAURA CAN SMOKE A POLITICAL EDITOR
LAURA THIS IS A MESS ISN'T IT BY ANY STANDARDS ALL THAT INSTABILITY IS RATHER ENOUGH TO SORT OF MAKE YOU FEEL SEASICK DOESN'T IT WHEN I TALK ABOUT ALL THAT LEADERSHIP VACUUM IS THAT THERE ARE OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT BUT YOU KNOW
THE BIG THING HERE IS THAT AFTER MONTHS OF MUTTERING AND A SLOW MOTION COUP THAT HAS FAILED TO PERSUADE JEREMY QUARANTA TO QUIT THERE IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE TO HIM ANGELA EAGLE WILL STAND UP TODAY AT A SPEECH IN CENTRAL LONDON AND SAY THAT SHE IS RUNNING AGAINST HIM SHE'S RUNNING FOR THE JOB THERE'S BEEN NO SIGN AT ALL THAT JERRY CALLING WILL BADGE WHAT STARTED WITH A SMALLISH GROUP OF LABOUR M.P.S SAY THEY COULDN'T SERVE UNDER HIM
SPREAD OVER THE MONTHS AND MONTHS BUT HE'S DUG IN DEEPLY INTO THE BUNKER STILL ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT YOU'LL HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE MEMBERSHIP MEMBERSHIP HAS STARTED GROWING TOO BUT THAT IS WHERE THEY ARE LABOUR M.P.S JUST FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS THE ONLY CHANCE THEY HAVE IS TO TRY TO ACTUALLY GET HIM OUT THROUGH A LEADERSHIP CONTEST
EVEN IF THEY ABSOLUTELY CANNOT BE ASSURED OF WINNING AND EVEN IF THERE IS STILL THIS LEGAL DISPUTE OVER WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY ON THE BALLET OR NOT NOW WILL ONLY ANSWERED BE ANSWERED BY THE PARTIES ANY SEA THERE STANLEY COMMITTEE THAT WILL MEET TOMORROW WHY DO THEY WANT TO GET RID OF HIM THEY SAY HE IS NOT PROVEN TO BE A GOOD LEADER BUT HE HAS ME TESTED YET AS I MEAN IN THE SENSE OF AN ELECTION OR ANYTHING
WELL I THINK THERE ARE KEY THINGS HERE I THINK FIRSTLY FACE FOR A SMALL GROUP OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO SUPPORT JEREMY CORBIN BECAUSE THEY WERE IMPLACABLY OPPOSED TO HIM A POLICY OF SHOOT I THINK THERE WAS A BIGGER GROUP WHO RESPECTED THE MANDALAY OVERWHELMING ENTHUSIASM BUT HE HAD BRINGING A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE INTO THE PARTY TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO HIM THEY WANTED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER RECENT MONTHS IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN JUST ISSUES ABOUT COMPETENCE
HOW MUCH DID YOU ACTUALLY DO IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN FOR EXAMPLE HE SUPPORTS YOU SAY THAT HE WAS OUT AND ABOUT ALL THE TIME YOU HEAR A VERY DIFFERENT TALE FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE CAMPAIGN ON QUESTIONS JUST ABOUT HOW YOU FUNCTION IN PARLIAMENT AFTER RESHUFFLES AND THEN MASS RESIGNATIONS THERE ISN'T EVEN RIGHT NOW A FULL LIST OF PEOPLE ON THE FRONT BENCH SO LAST WEEK FOR EXAMPLE IN THE COMMONS THAT WAS A PRETTY BIZARRE
AT TIMES PEOPLE COULD HAVE TURNING UP TO THE DISPATCH BOX FOR THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE NOT BEING QUITE SURE WHO WAS MEANT TO BE OPPOSING THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER ACROSS FROM THE DISPATCH BOX SO THERE ARE PLENTY OF M.P.S WHO SAY ACTUALLY THE TEST THAT HE HAS SEEN SO FAR HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO MEET BECAUSE LABOUR IS NOT WORKING IN PARLIAMENT AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT FUNCTIONING IN WHAT WE MIGHT ATOLL CONSIDER TO BE A NORMAL WAY WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS WOULD SAY IS WHEN IT COMES TO PARLIAMENTARY BY ELECTIONS OR WHEN IT COMES TO THE COUNCIL ELECTIONS OR OTHER ACTUAL ELECTORAL TESTS
JEREMY CORBIN ABSOLUTELY HASN'T BEEN DOING THAT BADLY AND THEY BELIEVE THAT BASICALLY POLITICS SHOULD BE DONE IN A DIFFERENT WAY ALL RIGHT MOST OF THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY THE TRADITIONAL TERMS OF THE DEAL IF YOU LIKE BETWEEN THE LEADER AND HIS PARTY HAVE BEEN BROKEN BROKEN QUITE TIME TO GO ALL RIGHT YOUR BEST GUESS AND IT'S GOT TO BE A GUESS WITH SLEEP AND WIPING THE CAVEAT WAS QUITE A LOT OF GOOD YOU KNOW THE QUESTION FOLLOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN
I THINK THERE WILL BE A LEADERSHIP CONTEST THAT MUCH NOW SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR IT SEEMS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THE ANY SEA WOULD SAY THAT THE SITTING LEADER WILL NOT BE ON THE BALLOT THERE ANY SEA IS VERY FINELY BALANCED BUT IT LOOKS TO ME VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SEE THAT BECAUSE
THE MEMBERS I THINK WOULD FEEL EXTREMELY DISGRUNTLED IN THAT SITUATION AND JEREMY CORBIN HAS PROBABLY ABOUT HALF THE SUPPORT OR NEED ANY SEA BUT THAT OF COURSE IS A QUESTION IT WILL ONLY BE SETTLED TOMORROW BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL BE GOING INTO A LEADERSHIP CONTEST WITH JEREMY CORBIN ON THE BALLOT ANGELA EAGLE ON THE BALLET BUT POTENTIALLY
SMITH THE SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WORK AND PENSIONS HE TODAY SEEING JEREMY CORBIN AGAIN PRIVATELY TO SUGGEST WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS FRESH IDEAS THAT COULD AVERT A CONTEST BUT I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT WE WILL HAVE EAGLE VERSUS KORBEN OVER THE SUMMER WHILE MAY VERSES LED SOME IS RUNNING AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE RACE IN THERE FOR THE UKIP LEADERSHIP TO READY
YOU WERE FUNNY EARLIER HOLIDAY NOT MUCH CHANCE OF THAT LYING DOWN UP AND IF YOU'RE PLANNING ANY HOLIDAYS ARE YOU WITH THEM WELL NO QUITE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S TURN TO DIANE ABBOTT WHO'S BEEN LISTENING TO ALL THAT ELLA I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT ONE AND YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ENEMY SEE SAYS NO HE CAN'T BE ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE HE HASN'T GOT TWENTY PER CENT
LABOUR M.P.S SUPPORTING HIM WHAT WOULD HE DO WITH DO IT WHAT DO YOU TAKE COURT ACTION SHOULD YOU TAKE WHAT ACTION I DON'T KNOW ABOUT COURT ACTION WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT IT'S CONTRARY TO ALL THE RULES OF NATURAL JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS THERE SITTING LEADER SHOULD NOT BE ON THE BALLOT I'M WAITING TO HEAR ANGELA EAGLE SPEAK OUT ABOUT THIS COS WHAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE IS IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE BALLET WITH THE LITRE SO SHE SHOULD BE SETTING OUT OF THOSE ROLLS UNDER THE RULES
NO DON'T SAY THAT THAT'S THE ROUTE OR NOT AT ALL HOW WILL I KNOW YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THAT TO THE LOO BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT ANGELA EAGLE IS IN A STRANGE POSITION OF WANTED TO CHINESE LEADERSHIP BUT NOT WANTING THE LEAD ON THE BACK THAT MAKES NO SENSE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE EITHER DOES IT TO HAVE THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY
WELL YOU KNOW I MEAN LAURA'S JUST SAYING THAT NO PARTING PALMS NOT FUNCTIONING THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE I'M NOT LOST RONNIE PHIL ALL THE LARGE SHADOWS JOBS LAST WEEK ANDY BURNHAM LED A VERY IMPORTANT DEBATE ON THE STATUS OF E.U. NATIONALS LIVING HERE I LET IT ABOUT ON THAT TOTALLY PHONEY PROMISED BY THE BRECHT'S CAMPAIGNERS
THAT THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK THEY CLAIM GOES THAT YOU WOULD GO TO THE N.H.S. WE ARE FUNCTIONING IT MAYBE THE MEDIA'S GIVING MORE PUBLICITY TO THE REAL WORLD HANG ON WE ARE A BUNCH OF ENABLE HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO FILL ALL THE SHADOW JOBS ALL THE OPPOSITION JOB THERE ARE A LOT BETTER BE THERE'S A LOT OF THEM BUT NONETHELESS NOT TO BE ABLE TO FILL THOSE JOBS FOR WHICH NORMALLY YOU'D EXPECT THEN PEAS TO BE FIGHTING TOOTH AND NOT TO GET THEM YOU WILL KNOW
SINCE YOU'VE HAD A BLOATED CABINET AND APLENTY CHANNEL THAT'S NOT THERE FOR REASONS OF PARTY MANAGEMENT IT THAT'S TRUE THINGS HE'LL BE HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO HAVE STOMPED OFF CARRYING THEIR AND BALL TO SAY HO HOLD ON THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE ON THE FRONT EDGE IT WAS THEIR INTENTION TO DRIVE JEREMY THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT I'M NOT I'M NOT DISPUTING THAT MOMENT BUT NEITHER YOU NOR I HAVE EVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS IN POLITICS BEFORE
I MEAN THEY'VE GONE A BIT FAR I DON'T THINK IT'S WHAT PARTY MEMBERS BUT THEY'VE GONE A BIT FAR BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT JEREMY CORBIN ARE GOING TO GO ON A BIT FAR BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A BIT WORKED UP SOME OF THEM AND THEY SAID THEY DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE
WAS ELECTED WITH THIS BIG MAN AND ACTUALLY ON ALL THE ELECT TOOL TEST YOU SPACE THE BY ELECTION AND SO ON HE STUNG PERFECTLY WELL AND THIS IDEA THAT CHERYL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BRECHT'S WINNING IS JUST ABSURD WELL COME BACK TO THAT A SECOND
THE FACT THAT YOU TALK ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND THE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY THE HEART ALL THAT BUT YOU SEEM TO FORGET THAT EACH OF THOSE M.P.S WHO IS OPPOSED TO MISTER CORBIN WAS HIMSELF OR HERSELF ELECTED BY HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE IT HAPPENS TO BE
AND THEREFORE THEY THEMSELVES HAVE A DEMOCRATIC MANDATE THEY WERE ELECTED AS LABOUR PARTY M.P. INDEED THE LABOUR PARTY HAS ELECTED ITS LEADER ANGELA IS COMPLETELY WITHIN HER RIGHTS TO RUN SO LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LEADERSHIP ELECTION WITH JEREMY ON THE BALA AND ANGELA AND WHOEVER ELSE WANTS TO RUN AND THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT WE WILL SEE ALL I WOULD ASK I THINK YOUR PARTY MEMBERS WOULD ASK IS THAT FINALLY
M.P.S GET BEHIND THE LEADER THAT THE PUB THERE NOT GOING TO ARE THEY THAT'S PERFECTLY CLEAR AGE WELL THEY NEED COURAGE SHOCKED BUT REGARD HIM AS DISASTROUS AND YOU KNOW THE ONE THING YOU KNOW THAT EVERY BEV USED SINGLE M.P. NOSES THE ONE THING YOU WORRY ABOUT MORE THAN ANYTHING FOR OBVIOUS REASONS PERFECTLY CREDIBLE TO LOSE WEIGHT IS HOLDING ON TO YOUR SEAT AND THEY THINK IF JEREMY CORBIN LEAD YOU INTO THE NEXT ELECTION AN AWFUL LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR SEATS
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT AT ANY GIVEN TIME YOU FIND A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LEADER OF THE PARTY IT'S ABSOLUTELY CASE APOLLA'S LIP OD HE'S TAKEN IT TO EXTREMES BUT WHAT PARTY MEMBERS WERE AND OUR BEST HOPE
OF GETTING A GOOD RESULT IN THE FORTHCOMING GENERAL THAT'S WHETHER IT'S NEXT YEAR OR TWENTY TWENTY IT'S FOR PEOPLE TO UNITE AND GET ON WITH TAKING THE FIGHT TO THE TOURIST CAN I ANGELA EAGLE PUPPY NICE WOMAN WHAT SHE IS IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING IS I'M FEELING EAGLE IS THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK CANDIDATE SHE VOTED FOR THE IRAQ WAR AND MORE BESIDES AT LEAST AT THE VERY LEAST OF PARTY MEMBERS WILL BE OFFERED A CLEAR POLITICAL TROY LET ME GIVE YOU A QUOTE
FROM JOHN LANDSMAN WHO WAS YOU KNOW CHAIRS MOMENTUM THE ORGANISATION THAT SUPPORTS MISTER CORBIN DEMOCRACY GIVES POWER TO PEOPLE
WINNING IS THE SMALL BIT THAT MATTERS TO POLITICAL ELITES WHO WANT TO KEEP THE POWER THEMSELVES
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT FOR MY CONSTITUENTS IN HACKNEY WHICH TOOK ABOUT DIVISIONS WE'VE SEEN A WEALTHY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO HACKNEY BUT ALSO EXTRAORDINARY POVERTY FOR MY COS IT'S LIKE ME WINNING IS EVERYTHING AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WIN ON TO JUGGLE COPING WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE
BECAUSE WHEN THAT WENT ACTUAL PEOPLE VOTING ACTUAL ELECTION WE'VE IMPROVED OTHER EVERY TIME BUT YOU KNOW THE ONE THING THAT DETERS PEOPLE FROM VOTED FOR A POLITICAL PARTY IS IF THEY THINK THAT PARTY IS SPLIT AND THE LABOUR PARTY WILL BE IF THIS GOES AHEAD WHEN NO IF ANY LONGER WHEN THIS GOES AHEAD IF YOU END UP WITH JEREMY CORBIN STILL IN POWER
STILL AS THE LEADER YOUR PARTY WILL BE IRREDEEMABLY SPLIT THIS IS A WESTMINSTER BUBBLE THING WHAT AT NUT THE GRASS ROOM WE'VE GOT EIGHTY PER CENT OF YOUR M.P.S WHO CAN'T STAND JEREMY YOU'RE TALKING DON'T WANT LET LEADER WESTMAN WHAT OF COURSE THE DEATH MEANT THAT I'M TORN AT THE GOVERNMENT NEVER DON'T TALK ABOUT THE PARTY AND ORDINARY PEOPLE THE GRASSROOTS JENNY WENT TO THE DURHAM MINERS' GUILE AND GOT AN AMAZING RECEPTION AT THE GRASS ROOTS
PEOPLE WANT THE PARTY TO EAT IN WESTMINSTER DO YOU NOT THAT'S WHAT THEY WON'T HURT YOU BUT AS I SAID A MINUTE AGO LABOUR M.P.S THEMSELVES HAVE A MANDATE A DEMOCRATIC MANDATE THEY THEY ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST LABOUR M.P.S AND THEREFORE NOT ME
IT MEANS THAT THEY SHOULD SUPPORT THE LABOUR LITRE SHOULD SURELY SUPPORT FOR THE THE PERSON WHO THEY THINK IS BEST FOR THE LABOUR PARTY AND THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE THE LEGS THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE TO ARGUE THAT CASE LAST SUMMER IN THE LEADERSHIP ELECTION
IN THE END WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AS A PARTY I I THINK THAT IS A AS WITHIN HER RIGHTS TO RUN SHEEP RUN WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT THIS TALK OF THE LABOUR PARTY SPLIT IT I WENT TO THE WHOLE S.T.P. ERA LET ME TELL YOU THERE WILL BE NO SPLIT THERE WILL BE NO SPLIT ALL RIGHT WELL WE MAY TALK AGAIN SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE DIANE ABBOTT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# IT'S TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT NOW DOZENS OF PROTESTERS WERE ARRESTED AGAIN LAST NIGHT IN BATON ROUGE IN LOUISIANA FOLLOWED DAY NOTHER TENSE STAND OFF WITH POLICE THEY WERE DEMONSTRATING FOR THE SIXTH STRAIGHT NIGHT AFTER THE DEATH OF ALTON STIRLING A BLACK MAN WHO WAS SHOT DEAD BY POLICE OFFICERS DESPITE SOME CLASHES THE PROTESTS HAVE BEEN LARGELY PEACEFUL BUT THEY SHOW NO SIGN OF ENDING AS LAURA BICKER REPORTS
IN BATON ROUGE THE PROTESTS CONTINUE
IT'S NEARLY A WEEK SINCE ALTON STIRLING WAS KILLED BY POLICE AND THERE HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS EVERY DAY
THIS ONE IS THE AFTERMATH OF A PEACEFUL MARCH TO THE LOUISIANA STATE CAPITOL BUILDING
HUNDREDS DECIDED TO TRY TO MAKE IT TO THE MAIN HIGHWAY BUT POLICE HAVE BLOCKED THERE WE WE TRIED FATHER OUT IN THE MORNING HE STARTED WALKING IN THE BLACK
THAT'S THEIR SKILL WITH BJORK HE WILL BE OUT ON THE LIBRARY'S HE'S BEEN PEACEFUL AT HOME
TOLD TO GET OFF THIS STREET WHERE THEY'LL BE ARRESTED
SOME WITHIN THE PROTEST PLEAD FOR THEM TO DO IS
BUT IF YOU GET LAST UP YOUR BOSSES
OFFICERS IN MY GEAR IN GAS MASKS EVENTUALLY MOVE FORWARD AND THE CROWED RUNG I PERSONALLY DON'T FEEL PROTECTED BY THE POLICE THERE ARE BIG SCARY ESTABAN STAB LIKE YOU'RE SCARED TO GET STARTED THAT'S NOT LAYERS YOU NEVER KNOW
THE GAG GAG IS SAD FOR RITA FORWARD REGISTRATION SO YOU GET TO EXPLORE YOU GET TO GO GIVE YOUR REGISTRATION YOU SHALL BE FORGIVEN REGISTRATION I THINK THEY ARE YOU A GRAND UP UNTIL MAGGOT NOWADAYS IF YOU MIND BLOW
I HAVEN'T I'VE GOT MY FRIENDS WORRY NILE CLAIRE FOR YOU COME ON AND IT WOBBLED AND RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S REALLY JUST SO IF I DON'T LIKE WHAT IT'S PERSONAL ANY PEOPLE AROUND LIKE ME TO SAY BECAUSE WE I WANT TO BE THE NEXT WEEK THE NEXT BEDROOM ON THE NEXT KNOW ELDON STERLING WITH THIS IS
AS THIS WILL DISCOURAGE THE DEMONSTRATION
HERE IS CALLED AN L. RAD ANOTHER DEFUSING TACT
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING
THE LARGEST GATHERING ON SATURDAY NIGHT SALFORD ONE HUNDRED S. THEY INCLUDED TWO JOURNALISTS AND THE BLACK LIVES MATTER LEADER DID IN THE CASE PLEASE SURE UNDER THE RIBS WHAT NOBBY SINCE
I KNOW THE ONLY PEOPLE DELAVAL NEST NIGHT WITH BEN REALLY PLEASED TO FIND THAT OTHER PROCESSES REMAIN PEACEFUL BOTH HERE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY
BUT JUST AS THE JAILS ARE EMPTIED THEIR FILLED BACK UP AGAIN WITH PROTESTERS
THE STATE GOVERNOR HAS DEFENDED THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE CALLING THE RESPONDS PROPORTIONAL
HE CALLED FOR CAM AND ADMITS MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO BRING THE POLICE AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY TOGETHER
OTHER LEADERS PATROL EACH PROTEST TRYING TO KEEP THE PEACE AMONG THEM IS CLEVE DONE JUNIOR WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS MADE THERE WE SAID ALL RIGHT TANA PADS AND WE WANNA BE OUTRAGE WANNA PROTEST WHY DO SOME CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BUT WE DON'T WANT OUR COMMUNITY AND WE DON'T WANT TO HARM US
ONCE IN THE RIGHT TO PROTEST ALONGSIDE THE NEEDS OF THE CITY IS PROVING DIFFICULT AND THIS PATTERN OF DAILY DEMONSTRATIONS SHOWS NO SIGN OF IT
EXTRA POLICE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP AND THEY ARE IN LARGE NUMBERS AND INFILL COMBO
EVENTUALLY EACH EVENING THE CROWDS DUDE
BUT THE ANGER THE OUTREACH REMAINS

# WHETHER A WIDESPREAD SHOWERS CLOUDY AT FIRST SOME BRIGHTNESS LATER THOUGH THE NEWS BUT THE SUNSHINE IT OVER LONDON AS I SPEAK O.K. YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM CHARLES CARROLL ANDREA LEAD SUMMER HAS APOLOGISED TO HER CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP RIVAL THERESA MADE FOR ANY HURT SHE CAUSED WITH HER COMMENTS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING CHILDREN MISSUS LED SOME HAS TOLD THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THAT SHE'S FELT UNDER ATTACK SINCE THE REMARKS WERE PUBLISHED
AIDS TO MISSUS MAY WHO DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN HAVE SAID SHE NEVER BELIEVED MISSUS LED SOME INTENDED TO CAUSE OFFENCE THE FORMER SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY ANGELA EAGLE WILL FORMALLY LAUNCH HER LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE AGAINST JEREMY CORBIN TODAY SAYING SHE WANTS TO SAVE THE LABOUR PARTY HE INSISTS THAT HE HAS THE OVERWHELMING BACKING AT THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP ON THIS PROGRAMME THE SHADOW HEALTH SECRETARY DIANE ABBOTT WHO SUPPORTS MISTER CORBIN REJECTED SUGGESTIONS BY SOME IN THE PARTY THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE ON THE BALLOT PAPER
# THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE IS IN NEW YORK TODAY ON THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF TRADE MISSIONS DESIGNED TO CALM GLOBAL INVESTORS WORRIED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF BREAKS IT IN AN ARTICLE FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL HE SAYS BRITAIN IS LEAVING THE E.U. BUT NOT WITHDRAWING FROM THE WORLD
# AND BRITAIN'S BIGGEST RAIL FRANCHISES REMOVING HUNDREDS OF SERVICES FROM TODAY TO TRY TO DEAL WITH A LONG TERM LA DISRUPTION PASSENGERS SOME OF WHOM SAY THEY'VE LOST THEIR JOBS AS A RESULT OF THE PROBLEMS ON SOUTHERN RAILWAY ARE HOLDING A PROTEST AT VICTORIA STATION IN LONDON TWENTY FIVE TO NINE HALF HOUR AGO WE HEARD THE LABOUR M.P. DIANE ABBOTT SAY THERE WILL BE NO SPLIT IN THE LABOUR PARTY AND JEREMY CORBIN WILL PROBABLY BE RE ELECTED AS ITS LEAD UP WELL WE SHALL SEE WHAT WE KNOW AS WE SPEAK
# FOR SURE THAT IS IS THAT MISTER CORBIN IS BEING CHALLENGED FOR THE LEADERSHIP BY ANGELA EAGLE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE MISTER CORBIN WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO ENTER THE CONTEST BECAUSE OPPONENTS SAY IF HE DOESN'T GET ENOUGH M.P.S NOMINATING HIM WITHIN THE RULES DON'T ALLOW HIM TO STAND AND I'M JOINED BY THE FORMER DEPUTY LEADER OF THE PARTY SHE WAS BRIEFLY ACTING LEADER LAST YEAR BEFORE MY GORDON'S ELECTED HARRIET HARMAN GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING LET'S DEAL WITH THE
BORING BIT IN ONE SENSE BUT VITALLY IMPORTANT BIT IN THE OTHER AND THAT AND THAT IS THE RULES OF THE LABOUR PARTY DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT A LEADER HAS TO GET ENOUGH M.P.S IF HE IS ABLE TO STAND FOR RE ELECTION
YES AND HAS TO HAVE THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF LABOUR M.P.S TO BE THAT ALTERNATIVE GOVERNMENT DOES ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS SO JUST JUST DEAL WITH WHETHER HE ABSOLUTELY HAS TO HAVE THAT THE TWENTY PER CENT OF LABOUR M.P.S AND ANY PEAS HE HAS TO HAVE TWENTY PERCENT CENT BE DOESN'T GET THOSE TWENTY PER CENT CAN'T BE ON THE BALLOT
YES AND FOR THE REASON AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE LEADER NEEDS TO LEAD AN ALTERNATIVE LABOUR GOVERNMENT SO THAT PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO ARE SUFFERING WHAT THE TORIES ARE DOING IN THIS COUNTRY CAN LOOK AND SEE THAT THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE LABOUR GOVERNMENT AND NOBODY IS SAYING YOU KNOW THAT JEREMY CORBIN CAN'T ENTER THE CONTEST BUT HE CAN'T SAY I'VE GOT THE RIGHT ONCE HAVING GOT ELECTED WITH THE SUPPORT OF LABOUR M.P.S
NOW THAT I FAILED AND I'VE LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF THOSE LABOUR M.P.S I'VE GOT THE RIGHT TO CARRY ON COME WHAT MAY IT IS PARTIES DIVIDED PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HER LABOUR POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY CAN BELIEVE IN AND THEY DON'T HAVE THAT NOW THAT'S WHY WE NEED A CHANGE OF LEAD BUT IT WAS YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE TWO VERY CLEAR LEGAL VIEWS ON THIS SOME SAY YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT OTHERS SAY NO YOU'RE WRONG AND IF IT GOES TO COURT IT COULD GO EITHER WAY AND IN ANY CASE IT'S LIKELY ISN'T IT THERE'D BE ANY SEA WILL AGREE
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF RULING BODY OF THE PARTY WILL AGREE THAT HE SHOULD BE ON THE BACK WELL I THINK STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT FROM THE LEGAL POINT TO THE IDEA THAT THE LEADER OF THE PARTY HAVING LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF LABOUR M.P.S THEN TAKES
THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE OR THE PARTY TO COURT IT'S JUST MORE DYSFUNCTION UPON MORE DYSFUNCTION AND THE PARTY IS SUFFERING BUT THE REASON WHY A CONSTITUTION WHICH WAS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SAID THAT THERE HAS TO BE A NOMINATION PROCESS AND THAT THE LEADER OF THE PARTY HAS TO HAVE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF SUPPORT OF THE PARTY IN PARLIAMENT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO LEAD THE PARTY IN PARLIAMENT
AS WELL AS THE WIDER PARTY IN THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS REACHING OUT TO VOTERS AND SO IT MAKES SENSE DOESN'T IT THAT ACTUALLY YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WIN THAT SUPPORT AND I WOULD SAY COS I KNOW THAT JEREMY KORBEN TALKS A LOT ABOUT HIS MANDATE AND
I KNOW THAT IT'S HAVING SEEN MANY LEADERS CLOSE UP SEVEN OF THEM IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO LEAD THE LABOUR PARTY IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO BE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION BUT IF YOU WIN THAT LEADERSHIP
THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO FAIL IT GIVES YOU THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING THE CHANCE TO TRY AND LEAVE THE PARTY BUT IF YOU FAIL YOU CAN'T TAKE THE PARTY DOWN WITH YOU THAT'S NOT FAIR I'M JUST WONDERING HOW YOU EXPLAIN TO THE LABOUR PARTY MEMBER WHO VOTED FOR JEREMY CORBIN
ALONG WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS SAW HIM DULY ELECTED THEN SEES HIM FORCED TO STAND DOWN BECAUSE A GROUP OF DISAFFECTED LABOUR M.P.S
DOESN'T WANT HIM AS THEIR LEADER I WONDER HOW YOU EXPLAIN HE'D THINK DEMOCRATIC TERMS THE PARTY VOTE FOR THE MAN THE M. P. SAY AFTER A FEW MONTHS WELL ACTUALLY WE DON'T WANT HIM AND THAT'S IT HE'S GONE
I I DON'T THINK THERE'S A GROUP OF DISAFFECTED LABOUR M.P.S I THINK THERE ARE SOME LABOUR M.P.S WHO NEVER SUPPORTED JEREMY AND EXPECTED HIM TO FAIL AND MIGHT NOW BE SAYING I TOLD YOU SO THERE ARE ACTUALLY THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY WHO'RE HAVING NOT SUPPORTED HIM WOULD STILL HAVE WANTED HIM TO SUCCEED AND THERE ARE ALSO THOSE WHO VOTED FOR HIM AND STRONGLY SUPPORTED HIM WHO HAVE NOW LOST CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND I THINK THAT THERE
IT IS DIFFICULT TO LEAD AND HE'S SHOWN THAT WHILST NOBODY'S SAYING HE'S A BAD MAN HE IS NOT A LEADER BUT WHAT'S THE PROOF OF THAT THAT'S THE THING THOUGH YOU DON'T LIKE IT O.K. YOU MAY NOT LIKE AN IDEOLOGICALLY YOU PERSONALLY BUT I'M TALKING COLLECTIVELY A BUG HOPE MOST OF LISTEN GUYS YOU'VE PUT THAT QUESTION YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE HIM IDEOLOGICALLY
MANY OF THE M.P.S WHO VOTED FOR NO CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND WHO REALISE RELUCTANTLY THERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE OF LEADER OF PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED HIM WHO DID IN YOUR WORDS LIKE HIM WHO DO IDEOLOGICALLY IDENTIFY WITH HIM THAT THIS IS A FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP AND I'LL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES THE FIRST IS THE E.U. REFERENDUM BY THE WAY THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS THAT THE LABOUR PARTY'S HAD WHICH CAUSED US TO LOSE IN TWENTY TEN
THAT WAS NOT JEREMY CORBIN'S FAULT LOSING TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT WAS NOT JEREMY CORBIN'S FAULT THE LABOUR PARTY HAS DEEP PROBLEMS NOT CAUSED BY JEREMY CORBIN BUT THE QUESTION IS IS JEREMY CORBIN THE LEADER WHO CAN HELP SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS AND UNFORTUNATELY HAVING WON THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD TAKE THE PARTY FORWARD IT IS EVIDENT EVEN FROM THOSE WHO MOST STRONGLY SUPPORTED HIM
THAT HE ACTUALLY CAN'T AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE WHICH WILL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES IS THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT AS WE NOW SEE DIDN'T LOSE IT IF YOU LOOK WELL HE DIDN'T WELL HE SAYS HE DID HIS DAMNEDEST WE SET UP WHEN I WAS ACTING LEADER OF THE LABOUR IN CAMPAIGN SO WE COULD HAVE A STRONG LABOUR ARGUMENT ABOUT WHY IT WAS IN BRITAIN'S INTEREST TO STAY IN EUROPE
AND HE GAVE OUT MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT WHAT LABOUR'S POSITION ALL RIGHT AND I ALONG WITH OTHER LABOUR M.P.S HEARD ON THE DOORSTEP PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT WE WERE FOR LEAVE ALL RIGHT SAY OTHER POINT WELL THERE'S A NUMBER OF POINTS ABOUT HOW COULD WE HAVE GOT TIME FOR AN ON THERE O.K. SORRY REFERENDUM BUT THE OTHER POINT IS THAT LABOUR M.P.S ARE HEARING ON THE DOORSTEP
PEOPLE WHO ARE CLEARLY SAYING THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE HE COULD BE PRIME MINISTER AND WITH HIM AS LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY THEY CANNOT SEE THAT HOPE THAT THEY NEED FOR LABOUR TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE GOVERNMENT HARRIET HARMAN MANY THANKS

PART OF D. C. WEBS ROLE WAS TO ASSEMBLE MATERIAL THAT MIGHT ASSIST THE CASE AND HE SPOKE TO TONY ABOUT HIS MUM A POTENTIALLY CRUCIAL WITNESS GIVING EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL TONY IS VERY VERY DEFENSIVE AND CARING OF HIS MUM
HE DID NOT WANT TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR THAT COURT I JUST SAID YOU'RE PUSHING FOR ME TO DO SOMETHING I DO ON A DO WHAT DO YOU DO IF IT WAS YOU AND I KNOW IT WAS AN HONEST ANSWER AND I THINK THAT WAS FROM THAT MOMENT THAT'S WHEN A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WAS FORGED ALTHOUGH THE COURT CASE RESULTED IN TWO GUILTY VERDICTS THE CONVICTIONS WERE OVERTURNED ON APPEAL AND THE CASE REMAINS OFFICIALLY UNSOLVED
MURDER WITHOUT MOTIVE FOR KILLING OF A WOMAN WHO HADN'T AN ENEMY IN THE WORLD
IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE PRIMARY SCHOOLTEACHER JOY HEWER WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND STABBED TO DEATH IN EAST LONDON FOR HER SISTER PENNY BARNES THE SHOCK OF THE BRUTAL MURDER WAS MADE WORSE BY THE WAY THE CASE WAS HANDLED BY THE POLICE FAMILY LIAISON OFFICER SHE FELT THE F. HELLO DIRECTED TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY THERE COULD'VE BEEN A LOT MORE COMMUNICATION INITIALLY BETWEEN THE F.A. AND ALL MEMBERS
THAT'S WHAT FUNDAMENTALLY WENT WRONG AND HOW DID THAT LEAVE YOU FEELING AT THAT TIME AND THEY'VE JUST FEELING TOTALLY SHUT
DISEMPOWERED EXCLUDED HELPLESS AND HOPELESS
ADDED TO THE OFFICE GREEN THAT PARTICULARLY MY PARENTS I THIEVING
AND IS AWFUL EXPERIENCE WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF STEPHEN LAWRENCE'S FAMILY ULTIMATELY LED TO AN OVERHAUL OF THE SYSTEM AND LAST YEAR AS POLICE PREPARED AN ANNIVERSARY APPEAL TO FIND HER SISTER'S KILLER PENNY WAS ASSIGNED A NEW F. FELLOW WHO'S FINALLY GIVING HER THE INFORMATION AND SUPPORT SHE KNEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING THIS EVENING I'M NORMAN MCCUE D.C.I. ONE OF THE S.I. I SEE THIS SKATING OFFICES ON THE HOMICIDE MAJOR
IN A SIGN OF HOW FAR POLICE HAVE COME IN RECOGNISING THE IMPORTANT ROLE PLAYED BY FAMILY LIAISON OFFICERS SCOTLAND YARD INVITED A GROUP OF FELLOWS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO COME UP WITH FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
DES IS ABOUT YOURSELVES THE FAMILIES YOU ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE HERE TWO OF THOSE ATTENDING WAS SOPHIA SPRING AND ANDREA MCDERMOTT THEIR SISTER CASSIE WAS MURDERED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN GET OUT
FROM A FAMILY LIAISON OFFICER I THINK HONESTY I THINK THAT TRUST TRUST BUILT IN THAT RELATIONSHIP HE FELT THAT WE COULD ASK
IT WAS IT WAS O.K. TILL WE COULD SCREEN MAKE A SHOUT WE CAN LIST RAGE COS WE WERE IN THAT PERIOD OF RAGE IN MARIO AND DANI
HE WAS MARIO'S OR DID IT SO ENTICING THAT MEMORY CAME BACK YEAH MARIO'S SUGH LAIR MURDERED CASSIE MCDERMOTT BUT IT TOOK A FURTHER EIGHT YEARS BEFORE HE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND THAT WAS AFTER HE'D ATTEMPTED TO KILL ANOTHER WOMAN CARA HEIGHT WHO WAS LEFT WITH BRAIN DAMAGE WHICH BADLY AFFECTED HER SPEECH OW
I PRAY YOU DEAR HOW COULD YOU DO THAT NO AND THESE AMAZING NO
NOW REFLECTING ON A PROTRACTED CASE WHICH INVOLVED COMPLEX LEGAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE NEW DOUBLE JEOPARDY LAWS THE FAMILY LIAISON OFFICER FOR THE MCDERMOTT'S CATHERINE GREGORY IS PASSING ON HER UNVARNISHED ADVICE TO OTHERS IN THE ROLL DON'T TRY AND
AND WE SAY A BAD WORD I WENT TO YOU CAN SOPER DOES THAT DON'T BULLSHIT PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT TO BE STRAIGHT NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS BECAUSE THE WORST THING HAS HAPPENED TO THAT FAMILY COULD EVER HAPPEN SO NOTHING YOU CAN SAY IS EVER GOING TO MATCH THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE TOLD ABOUT THEIR RELATIVE NOT ONE DIME
# DANNY SHAW REPORTING THERE ON F. L. THOSE THERESA MAY WILL LAUNCH HER CAMPAIGN FOR THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP THIS MORNING WITH THE PROMISE OF PUT WORKERS ON THE BOARDS OF MAJOR COMPANIES AND CURB EXCESS CORPORATE PACE SO SHE WANTS A BRITAIN THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGED FEW DIANE CALL IS PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AT MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY FORMER ADVISER TO THE TREASURY I I THINK WE PROBABLY WRITTEN WORKS FOR EVERYONE NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGED FEW ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE HAVEN'T WE
WELL CERTAINLY BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THERE WAS A FASHION FOR WORK WORKERS ON BOARDS THERE'S THE STAKEHOLDER CAPITALISM ARGUMENT IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SO IT DOES COME AND GO BUT OF COURSE WE HAVE SEEN UNSUPPORTABLE EXCESS IN EXECUTIVE PAY BRITISH IT'S VERY BADLY MANAGED HE'D REALLY HAS GONE BONKERS RECENTLY HASN'T IT RECENTLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS
YES AND IT WILL BE A BIT LESS BAD OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS EARLIER BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT WHICH I THINK ALL REASONABLE PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO AGREE THAT AT THE TOP COOKED EXECUTIVES ARE PAID FAR TOO MUCH AND A PACKAGE OF MEASURES THAT WOULD LIMIT THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT COMPANIES WORK IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES IN SERVICE VERY SENSIBLE BUT HOW DO YOU STOP IT
BUT USING CORPORATE LAW USING EXACTLY THE KIND OF THINGS AS I GATHER MISSUS MAY IS SUGGESTING THAT YOU LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF BOARDS YOU LOOK AT HOME AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEES WORK YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF REPORTING THAT COMPANIES HAVE TO DO IT DOES TAKE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION TO GET ALL THIS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IN THE END IT IS FOUR
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE AND THEN THE FULL BOARD TO AGREE SO IF THEY THINK THAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS WORTH TWENTY MILLION QUID A YEAR AND THEY VOTE FOR THAT GOVERNMENT HAS NO POWER AT THE MOMENT EVEN IF IT HAD THE WILL POWER TO STOP THAT AND SAY NO HE'S ONLY WORTH TWO MILLION OR FIVE HUNDRED QUID OR SOMETHING
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY TIME IT WOULD TAKE CHANGES IN CORPORATE LAW I THINK TO BRING THIS ABOUT SHAREHOLDERS HAVE ADVISORY POWER AND WE'VE SEEN SOME SHAREHOLDER VOTE DISCOMFORT WITH THE LEVELS OF PAY YEAH BUT THAT'S IT THIS COMFORT ISN'T IT YEAH AND ABOUT TIME TOO BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT A BOARD MAKING THE DECISION
AND THEY HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN WORKING VERY NICELY FULL OF PEOPLE ON BOARD THERE ARE WRAPPED UP PUT RATCHETS AND THEIR PAY OR HAVING A CHANGE IN CORPORATE LAW THAT WILL BRING THIS ABOUT I THINK HE'S HE'S WELCOME A LITTLE BIT OF A SURPRISE TO HEAR IT FROM A CONSERVATIVE O.K. MINOR IS CHRIS HOME TO YOU EXACTLY THAT IN THE IDEA OF THAT OF THE TORIES WERE VOTING FOR
CURBS ON SOME OF THEIR BIGGEST DONORS APART FROM ANYTHING ELSE BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK IT WILL COME AS A BIG SURPRISE OR A MATTER OF HORROR TO LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THE CORPORATE WORLD AS WELL I THINK IT WILL TODAY CHIEF EXECS
THEY'VE GOT PLENTY OF MONEY IN THE BANK ALREADY THANKS THEY CAN THEY CAN COPE WITH IT BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CORPORATE MOTIVE RECOGNISE THAT THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR BUT IF YOUR YOU CAN'T NO SINGLE COMPANY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP THIS UP PUT A CHIP BY ITSELF SO I THINK SOME MEASURES IN THE LAW TO BRING IT ABOUT WE WELCOME AND THAT WOULD BE WHAT A STRAIGHTFORWARD PIECE OF LEGISLATION SAYING WHAT IT COS YOU CAN'T PUT A TOP AN UPPER LIMIT CAN DO YOU CAN'T SAY NO C.E.O. SHOULD GET MORE THAN
TWO MILLION OR WHATEVER IT IS I WOULD IT WORK WHAT IT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE MAKING SHAREHOLDER VOTE SPINE DOING THE TALKING IT TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF CORPORATE REPORTING THAT'S REQUIRED FOR EXAMPLE MAKING IT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT THAT THE RATIO OF TOP TO AVERAGE PAIN THE COMPANY HAS TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT SO THERE'S NO DIRECT WAY OF DOING IT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO SEE THE GOVERNMENT TELLING COMPANIES HAD TO BE RUN
WE DO HAVE VERY BADLY MANAGED COMPANIES IN THE U.K. IT'S PART OF THE REASON OUR PRODUCTIVITY LEVELS ARE LOWER THAN OTHER COUNTRIES AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS THE ANTAGONISTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MANAGERS AND PEOPLE ON THE SHOP OH INTERESTING THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
# IT'S FIVE MINUTES TO NINE THERE WILL BE NO SPLIT THAT'S WHAT DIANE ABBOTT TOLD US HALF AN HOUR AGO HOW COULD THERE NOT BE THERE WILL BE A LEADERSHIP CONTEST ILLEGAL HAS WILL LAUNCH HER CHALLENGE TODAY AND WHAT'S THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF LABOUR M.P.S DO YOU NOT WANT JEREMY CORBIN THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF LABOUR MEMBERS DO SO HOW COULD HE PLAY OUT WELL HERE IN THE STUDIO STEPHEN BUSHY SPECIAL CORRESPOND WITH HER NEW STATEMENT JACKIE ASHLEY IS POLITICAL JOURNALIST OF COURSE GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING JACKIE ASHLEY CAN YOU SEE
WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE POT LABOUR PARTY'S PRETTY NOW DO IT WELL YOU GO ROUND ALL THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LITTLE ELSE WITH THEIR LABOUR M.P.S IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND YOU KEEP THINKING WELL IT SURELY CAN'T SPLIT CAN IT BECAUSE EVERYONE REMEMBERS THE S.T.P. I REMEMBER THE S.D.P. WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG JOURNALIST MYSELF BUT I THINK TIMES ARE DIFFERENT NOW AND I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS YOU THINK ACTUALLY PROBABLY THE PARTY MIGHT WELL SPLIT AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE
IF JEREMY CORBIN IS RE ELECTED AND I BELIEVE THAT IF HE'S ON THE BALLOT HE WILL BE RE ELECTED BECAUSE PARTLY BECAUSE OF THESE A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND NEW MEMBERS IF HE IS RE ELECTED THEN I THINK ALL THOSE M.P.S WHO DON'T SUPPORT HIM WILL CONTINUE NOT TO SUPPORT HIM THEY WON'T COME INTO LINE AND SO WHAT DO THEY DO THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THEIR SEATS SO THEY DO PERHAPS SPLIT AWAY
BUT THEY COULD STILL LOSE THE SEATS OF THOSE BUT OR WERE WELL THEY COULD BUT IN A WAY THEY'VE NOTHING TO LOSE HAVE I THINK THERE'S TWO OPTIONS ONE THEY CAN SET UP A SEPARATE LITTLE GROUP WITHIN PARLIAMENT TO SAY O.K. SO WE'RE NOW THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION WITHIN PARLIAMENT BUT I THINK MORE LIKELY IS THAT A NEW GROUP FORMING IN THE COUNTRY PADDY ASHDOWN HE'S YOU KNOW HE'S ALREADY STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS
A WHOLE SORT OF PRO E.U. MOVEMENT WHICH WAS START OFF AS A MASS MOVEMENT A LOT OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND WHO KNOWS YOU MIGHT GET TORY REMAIN AS IF ANDREA LEAD SOME WERE TO BECOME THE PRIME MINISTER YOU MIGHT GET LIB DEMS WHO WERE CERTAINLY NEED A BIT OF A BOOST AT THE MOMENT AND YOU MIGHT GET YOU KNOW THE MAINSTREAM IF YOU LIKE LABOUR PARTY WHOLE SHATTERING OF NOT GOING TO THE PARTIES IS STEPHEN BUSH WHAT ABOUT WEARING YOU ON WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN THE WAY THIS PLACE
I THINK JACKIE'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND IF HE IS ON THE BALLET HE WILL BE RE ELECTED AND THERE WILL BE A SPLIT IT FEELS THAT EVEN PEOPLE IN THE LABOUR PARTY WHO I WOULD DESCRIBE AS BEING BORN INTO IT THE KIND OF LABOUR M.P.S WHO NAME THEIR CHILDREN OFF TO FORMER LABOUR PRIME MINISTERS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEAVING THE LABOUR PARTY SO THERE'S BEEN A BIG BIG SHIFT AMONG CORBIN'S CRITICS
HOWEVER I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT THAT FAR LABOUR'S RULES ARE NOT VERY HELPFULLY WRITTEN AND MY INSTINCT IS TOM WATSON BREAKING OFF THESE PEACE TALKS SO ABRUPTLY IRRITATING THE TRADE UNIONS I THINK HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT IF HE DIDN'T HAVE AN ACE IN THE HOLE AND I THINK HE'S ACE IN THE HOLE ISN'T THE ONLY SEES GONNA RULED AND HE HAS TO COLLECT NOMINATIONS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CANDIDATE BUT THEN THE ONLY SEA AND WE KNOW A MEETING TOMORROW AND TO CONSIDER THIS IF THEY DO KEEP HIM OFF THE BALLOT PAPER THOUGH HE'S SAID HE'S GOING TO CHALLENGE IT
AND I'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING TO A LOT LOTS OF JUDGES AND I AM YET TO FIND SOMEONE WHO SAYS WELL ACTUALLY
IF THE ANY SEA HAS A REASONABLE ARGUMENT FOR WHY THEY FOLLOWED THE RULES THAT WAY THEY KNOW I HAVEN'T I'M YET TO FIND A JUDGE WHO WANTS TO GET INVOLVED IN THAT PARTICULAR MESS TO BE HONEST IT'S A PRIVATE ASSOCIATION JUST AS WITH A TRADE UNION AND THERE'S GONNA BE SOME INTERESTING KNOCK ON EFFECTS LATER DOWN THE LINE BUT THE SOME OF THE TRADE UNION LEADERS OF COURSE GETTING TO RETIREMENT AGE I'D LIKE TO RUN FOR RE ELECTION THERE THEY'RE HITTING UP AGAINST THEIR OWN INTERNAL RULES SO
I THINK HE COULD BE KEPT OFF AND ACTUALLY IT COULD BE THE MARK THE END OF THE STORY BUT DEFINITELY THE END OF THE LEADERSHIP STORY A BIT BUT THEN A DIFFERENT SPLIT AWAY BECAUSE YOU THEN HAVE ALL THOSE MEMBERS I MEAN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WHO WERE COMPLETELY HACKED OFF BECAUSE THEIR WISHES ARE BEING DROPPED IT YES AND I SUPPOSE THE AT THE QUESTION THEN IS DO THEY ALL JUST LEAVE THE LABOUR PARTY AND A LOT OF THEM ARE JOINED VERY RECENTLY PAYING THEY'RE THREE POUNDS NINETY TWO A MONTH WHICH IS CHEAP AT THE PRICE THEY JUST THEN LEAVE AND GO OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE OR DO THEY STAY AND TRY AND
WORK IN ANOTHER WAY TO GET A LEFT WING LEADER BACK INTO THE LEADERSHIP CONTEST AND I SUSPECT THEY WON'T GO AWAY I THINK HAVING MADE THIS MUCH HEADWAY WHICH THEY'VE DONE VERY SUCCESSFULLY OVER THE PAST WILL RELEASE ITS CORBIN WAS ELECTED I DON'T THINK THEY'LL GO AWAY AND SO I THINK THE TROUBLE THEN MOVE TO THE CONSTITUENCY PARTY LEVEL WHERE YOU HAVE ALL SORTS OF CALLS ALREADY HAVING CALLED FOR DESELECTION HAVE A LOT OF THE M.P.S WHO HAVEN'T SUPPORTED CORBIN
BUT NOW IT'S SO INTERESTING YOU RAISE THIS IDEA OF ANOTHER PARTY FOR ME BUT I MEAN PARTICULARLY YOU MAKE THE POINT OF ANDREA LEAD SOME IS ELECTED CONSERVATIVE LEADER WHICH I THINK IS HIGHLY POSSIBLE BY THE WAY DO YOU I DO BECAUSE BECAUSE I THINK THE TORY PARTY MEMBERSHIP UNLIKE THE LABOUR MEMBERSHIP HAS SHRUNK RECENTLY I THINK IT'S MORE A HARD CORE OF I THINK QUITE RIGHT WING AND VERY PRO BRECHT'S IT CONSERVATIVES AT THE GRASS ROOTS AND I THINK THEY'RE QUITE CAPABLE OF ELECTING ANDREA LED TO SOME
EVEN THOUGH AGAIN YOU'VE GOT THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY WANTING REZA MADE BY QUITE A LARGE MAJORITY SO THEN PERHAPS BUT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN EVER TIBBLE ANYWAY BECAUSE OF THE WAY OF PEOPLE'S POLITICS THAT THAT ACTUALLY COMES DOWN TO THE IDEOLOGIES BEHIND ALL THESE CON WELL IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT MOST A LARGE PART OF THE BRITISH ELECTORATE I WOULD SAY A FAIRLY MIDDLE OF THE ROAD IF YOU END UP WITH THE CONSERVATIVES LED BY ANDREA LEAD SOME LABOUR LED BY JEREMY CORBIN
IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE ISN'T IT THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW REALIGNMENT TO FILL THAT MIDDLE GAP A FINAL WORD STEPHEN BUSH THERE WILL BE A SPLIT YEAH I THINK ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THERE WILL BE TWO SEPARATE LABOUR PARTY'S THIS TIME NEXT YEAR GREAT
