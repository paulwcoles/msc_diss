IT'S ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT ONE IN FOUR CHILDREN RECEIVES OUT OF SCHOOL TUITION YET MANY ARE BEING TAUGHT BY PEOPLE WHO HAD NO CRIMINAL RECORD CHECKS IF THE TUTOR IS SUPPLIED BY AN AGENCY IT'S LIKELY BUT NOT CERTAIN THEY'LL HAVE BEEN VETTED BUT IF A TUTOR IS SELF EMPLOYED THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR ANY CHEQUES AT ALL
THE N.S.P.C.C. SAYS IT'S A LEGAL LOOPHOLE AMONG SEVERAL CASES IT HIGHLIGHTS IS THAT OF ROBERT MITCHELL FROM BOLTON A SCIENCE TUTOR WHO WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE ABUSING PUPILS DESPITE HAVING BEEN CONVICTED OF POSSESSING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDECENT IMAGES OF CHILDREN

# SI MC ATTACH A REPORTING THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S GET THE WEATHER FORECAST PHILIP AVERY STANDING BY AT THE B.B.C. WEATHER CENTRE MORNING FELT MICHELLE VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU LET'S RUN A BROAD BRUSH AWAY OVER THE WEATHER PROSPECTS FOR ENGLAND AND WALES FIRST UP THE LAST OF THE OVERNIGHT RAIN IS STILL THERE ACROSS PARTS OF EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST WILL TAKE A PART OF THE MORNING AT LEAST TO GET AWAY INTO THE NORTH SEA AND THEN SOMETHING OF A DRIER INTERLUDE IN SOME OF THESE EASTERN PARTS UNTIL

INTO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND MORE GENERALLY I THINK THOSE EARLY SHOWERS THERE ACROSS THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND THERE MAY BE MORE THIS AFTERNOON FEW WERE ON TO THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PENNINES TEMPERATURES AROUND ABOUT THE MID TEENS TWENTY IN THE LONDON AREA PERHAPS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND SOUTHERN AND WESTERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND WILL HEAR SOME AIR HE'S ALREADY SEEN ONE OR TWO SHOWERS I THINK THESE WILL BECOME MORE PREVALENT AS THE DAY GETS GOING AND HEAR SOME OF THE SHOWERS REALLY QUITE SHARP MAY EVEN HEAR THE ODD RUMBLE OF THUNDER
GENERALLY SPEAKING THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND WILL BE SOMEWHAT DRIER ALTHOUGH I WOULD BE AT ALL SURPRISED COME MID AFTERNOON TO SEE SHOWERS POPPING OFF OVER THE HIGHER GROUND PARTICULARLY THE GRAMPIANS FOR EXAMPLE ORKNEY IN QUITE WELL WITH SOME DECENT DRY WEATHER HERE SOME SUNSHINE LESS SO THAT PROSPECT I'M AFRAID FOR SHETLAND MISERABLE FARE HERE FOR A GOOD PART OF THE DAY TEMPERATURE AGAIN IN THE MID TEENS THANK YOU PHIL IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS DOMINATED HAVE CAUSED BY THE STORY THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO GET A NEW PRIME MINISTER
# AND TO WAVE FAREWELL TO THE OLD ONE TO DAVID CAMERON ONE STOREY ONE PARTICULAR ANGLE DOMINATES THOUGH AS A RESULT OF A BRIEFING FROM THERESA MAY'S NEW TEAM AND IT IS CAPTURED IN THE DAILY MAIL HEADLINE MAZE WOMEN ON THE MARCH THERESA MAY TODAY THE PAPER SAYS BECOMES BRITAIN'S SECOND EVER FEMALE PRIME MINISTER WILL SWIFTLY PROMOTE A STRING OF WOMEN TO SENIOR CABINET POSTS NOW LOTS OF NAMES BUT MOST OF THEM SPECULATIVE
THE NAMES YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON TODAY AMBER RUDD TIPPED POSSIBLY TO BE HOME SECRETARY JUSTINE GREENING CURRENTLY OF COURSE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY TIP FOR A TOP JOB PRETTY PATEL TO KAREN BRADLEY CURRENTLY HOME OFFICE MINISTER WORKING ALONGSIDE THERESA MAY ANDREA LED TO THE OTHER WOMAN WHO CHALLENGE BRIEFLY FOR THE TORY LEADERSHIP THE WAY IN WHICH OTHER PAPERS PUT IT GUARDIAN MAZE DRIVE FOR MORE WOMEN IN HER CABINET MAY SET TO BOOST RANKS OF TOP FEMALE POLITICIANS CEPT IT SAYS THE F.T.
AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY THE PAPERS AND CALL TIME ON OSBORNE IN OTHERWISE THIS'LL COULD ALSO BE THEIR LAST DAY IN GOVERNMENT FOR GEORGE OSBORNE AND FINALLY THE TELEGRAPH ON THIS HAS A HEADLINE ABOUT MY CAMERON AS I LEAVE TODAY HE QUOTAS AND AS TELLING THE PAPER I HOPE PEOPLE WILL SEE A STRONGER COUNTRY
# THE OTHER MAIN STORY IN THE PAPERS TODAY IS THE LATEST ON THE LABOUR PARTY IN THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE GUARDIAN'S FRONT PAGE JEREMY CALLED WAS JUBILANT LAST NIGHT AFTER THE PARTY'S RULING NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DECIDED THAT HIS NAME SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY APPEAR ON THE BALLOT PAPER IN THE LEADERSHIP CONTEST TRIGGERED BY ANGELA EAGLE'S CHALLENGE THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THAT WHEN MY SPOKE TO CHEERING SUPPORTERS AFTER THE DECISION CAME THROUGH HE EFFECTIVELY LAUNCHED HIS RE ELECTION CAMPAIGN BY SAYING
HE WOULD TAKE HIS MESSAGE OF FIGHTING IN QUALITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO STRENGTHEN LABOUR THE TIMES POINTS OUT THOUGH THAT IN A BOOST FOR THE MODERATES THE ANY SEA ALSO RULE THAT ONLY THOSE WHO'D BEEN MEMBERS OF THE PARTY FOR SIX MONTHS COULD VOTE IN THE CONTEST TO MOVE THAT WILL PREVENT THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO'VE SIGNED UP SINCE THE E.U. REFERENDUM THREE WEEKS AGO
FROM HAVING A SAY IT ALSO RULE THE PEOPLE WANTING TO SIGN UP AS REGISTERED SUPPORTERS ARE STATUS AGUS AM A ONE OFF IT IN THE CONTEST MUST PAY TWENTY FIVE HANDS RATHER THAN THE THREE POUNDS REQUIRED FOR LAST SUMMER'S LEADERSHIP ELECTION THE MIRRA PUTS IT THIS WAY BATTLE FOR THE PARTY'S FUTURE IT SAYS AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE UNCIVIL WAR
COULD SPLIT LABOUR FOR EVER IT SAYS THAT REBEL M.P.S MAY LEAVE THE PARTY IF CORBIN WINS THE LEADERSHIP VOTE WHICH MANY OF THEM ARE VERY VERY NERVOUS THAT HE MIGHT DO WELL THAT WAS WHAT WAS DOMINATING WESTMINSTER YESTERDAY EVEN THOUGH OF COURSE PEOPLE MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THERESA MAY TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER MAN IT WAS THERE FOR US WAS ROSS HAWKINS BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT
WHAT DECISIONS WERE TAKEN ROSS GIVE US A SENSE OF THE RAW EMOTION THE RAGE THAT IS GRIPPING THE LABOUR PARTY AT THE MOMENT
JEREMY CORBIN SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT DID NOT EXPECT TO WIN THIS ARGUMENT EVER SINCE IT WAS HER THAT THERE WILL BE A SECRET BOAT ON THE N.E. SEE THEY DIDN'T EXPECT HIM TO BE STRAIGHT ON THE PAD AND WHEN HE WAS WITH THAT NEWS CAME THROUGH ONE A. WAS SO EXCITED HE WAS HUGGING PEOPLE AS THOUGH WE JUST SCORED THE WINNING GOAL I WAS TALKING TO A CLOSE ALLY OF JEREMY CORBIN MEMBER THE SHADOW CABINET AND A LABOUR M.P. JAMIE REID CAME UP INTERRUPTED A CONVERSATION POINT A FINGER AT THIS MEMBER OF THE SHADOW CABINET AS YOU'VE
ALMOST KILLED THE LABOUR PARTY THERE IS SUCH CONCERN NOW ABOUT THE TENOR THE ABUSE IN THIS DEBATE BUT I'M TOLD BY TWO SAUCES THE ANY SEA TOOK THE DECISION LAST NIGHT TO SUSPEND
ALL THE LOCAL LABOUR PARTY L. P. AND BRANCH MEETINGS UNTIL THE NEW LEADER IS ELECTED BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT HARASSMENT INTIMIDATION AND BULLY TO SEAL PAYS CONSTITUENCY LABOUR PARTIES WILL NOT MEET AT ALL OVER THIS PERIOD AT TWO SOURCES HAVE TOLD ME THAT THAT THAT WAS THE DECISION AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE STORIES THAT WE'VE HEARD TIME AND AGAIN
ALLEGATIONS OF HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS OF INTIMIDATION ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE NOW THE OTHER THING WE DON'T LAST NIGHT WAS IF YOU LIKE THE RULE BOOK FOR THIS CONTEST SO ONLY MEMBERS WHO JOINED AFTER JANUARY THE TWELFTH WILL GET A VOTE THAT WILL WIPE OUT TENS AND TENS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO THERE WILL BE A BRIEF PERIOD NEXT WEEK WHEN REGISTERED SUPPORTERS CAN WHEN PEOPLE CAN REGISTER TO BE A REGISTERED SUPPORTER TO HAVE A ONE OFF FOLKS IN THIS CONTEST THAT WILL COST THEM
TWENTY FIVE POUNDS MUCH MORE THAN THE THREE BEFORE ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO PAY THREE POUNDS LAST LEADERSHIP ELECTION THEY WERE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE TO RE REGISTER AND DO THAT AGAIN IF THEY WANTED TO IF THEY HADN'T BECOME MEMBERS BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY MUCH MORE NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW DO THESE RULE CHANGES AFFECT THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME THERE'S NO DOUBT AS YOU SAY IT WAS A VICTORY FOR JEREMY CALLING TO GET ON THE BALLOT DESPITE THE FACT YOU CAN'T M.P.S TO BACK HIM
BUT THESE MEMBERSHIP CHANGES ARE THOSE WIPING OUT ALL THE PEOPLE HE'D RECRUITED IN HIS SUPPORTERS TO BACK HIM IS IT SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR HIS OPPONENT THEY WILL WIPE OUT SOME THEY WILL WIPE OUT THOSE SINCE JANUARY NO ONE HAS A CLEAR IDEA OF THE THE MAKE UP OF THESE NEW MEMBERS BETWEEN PRO JEREMY CORBIN AND ANTI JEREMY CALL IN THERE SOME PRETTY ROUGH ESTIMATES OF
WHAT IT WILL STOP THOUGH IT'S A RECRUITMENT RACE BECAUSE THERE'LL BE JUST TWO DAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO SIGN UP AS WELL THE RACE TO BE THE NEXT LABOUR LEADER GET TAKES A NEW TURN TODAY THOUGH BECAUSE A NEW NAME COMES ON BOARD OWEN SMITH WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIM JOINING THAT RACE HE IS SET TO DECLARE WE ALREADY HAVE ONE DECLARED ANTI CORBIN CANDIDATE THE REGAL AND IN A NUTSHELL THE POLITICS OF THIS A HUGE FEELING THEY SHOULD ONLY BE ONE
ANTI JEREMY CORBIN CANDY IS THE REGAL IS OWEN SMITH THAT IS LIKE TO BE DECIDED ON WHO CAN PROVE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST SUPPORT AND I SUSPECT THE DISCUSSION WILL COME DOWN TO A VERY SIMPLE POINT WHICH OF THOSE TWO CANDIDATES CAN SAY THEY HAVE THE BEST CHANCE AND CAN PROVE IT BY SAYING THEY HAVE THE MOST NOMINATIONS ONE M. P. VERY CLOSE DORIAN SMITH TOLD ME LAST NIGHT WE HAVE MORE SUPPORT THAN ANGELA AND THE TEST WILL BE IS THAT TRUE
# TALK IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX RESCUE TEAMS ARE CONTINUING TO SEARCH THROUGH THE SITE OF THE TRAIN CRASH IN SOUTHERN ITALY THAT KILLED TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE THE B. DAN JOHNSON IS AT THE SITE NEAR THE TOWN OF ANDREA IN POO OR DAN DO WE KNOW YET HOW IT CAME TO BE THAT TWO TRAINS WERE ON THE SAME BIT OF TRACK AT THE SAME TIME
THERE'S NOT A THING FOR CERTAIN THE INVESTIGATION WILL GET UNDER WAY PROPERLY LATER THIS MORNING AND THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT HOW THOSE TWO TRAINS COULD HAVE ENDED UP ON THE SAME SINGLE PIECE OF TRACK SPEEDING TOWARDS EACH OTHER THE SPEED RESTRICTION SIGNS BY THE LINE HERE SAY ONE HUNDRED KILOMETRES AN HOUR AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE TWO TRAINS WE'RE DOING SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT WHEN THEY HIT EACH OTHER IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TIME
FOR THE DRIVERS TO DO ANYTHING IN TERMS OF EMERGENCY BRAKING SO THIS WAS A VERY FORCEFUL IMPACT AND THE PILE OF WRECKAGE HERE BY THE LINE THIS MORNING GIVES YOU SOME IDEA OF THE POWER INVOLVED THERE ARE HUGE DIGGERS HERE STILL SHIFTING THE WRECKAGE FROM THE LINE
MAKING A PILE OF SCRAP METAL WHICH REALLY IS UNRECOGNISABLE AS PARTS OF A TRAIN IT LOOKS LIKE A SCRAP HEAP BUT THIS IS THE EVIDENCE THAT INVESTIGATORS WILL START GOING THROUGH LATER TODAY AND STILL SADLY AS THEY MOVE PIECES OF WRECKAGE THEY ARE OCCASIONALLY FINDING MORE BODIES TO AND THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER SAW THE SITE FOR HIMSELF
HE DID YES MATTIE YOUR N.Z. CAME HERE LAST NIGHT TO THANK THE RESCUE WORKERS AND TO SHOW SOME SUPPORT FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS HE HAS EMPHASISED THAT THERE WILL BE A FULL INVESTIGATION HE SAID NOTHING SHOULD BE HELD BACK TO GET ANSWERS FOR THOSE FAMILIES THERE HAS BEEN SOME
BAD HISTORY WITH RAIL ACCIDENTS IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THIS WAS A PRIVATELY RUN LINER OF RURAL COMMUTER LINE DOWN IN THE SOUTH OF ITALY AND THE CRASH HAPPEN ON QUITE A REMOTE SPOT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE MAIN STATE RUN INTERCITY LINES THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT INVESTMENT AT TIMES BUT IT APPEARS THAT THESE TWO TRAINS WERE BOTH MODERN SO THE FOCUS OF THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE ON WHETHER THERE WAS SOME FORM OF
TECHNICAL FAILURE WITH THE LINE SIDE EQUIPMENT OR THE TRAINS THEMSELVES OR WHETHER THIS CAME DOWN TO HUMAN ERROR EITHER ON THE PART OF THE DRIVERS OF ONE OF THE TWO TRAINS OR THE SIGNALLERS WHO WERE CONTROLLING WHICH PIECES OF TRACK THEY WERE ON ONE
# DAN JOHNSON INPUT THANK YOU IT'S SIX SIXTEEN NOW WE GET A NEW PRIME MINISTER WE PROBABLY GET A NEW CHANCELLOR IF NOT TODAY BY TOMORROW WILL THAT MEAN NEW ECONOMIC IDEAS THERESA MAY SUGGESTED THAT SHE MIGHT BE THINKING BIG ABOUT THAT DOMINIC O'CONNELL IS HERE WITH SOME GUESTS WHO ARE PREPARED TO HELP HER WITH A FEW IDEAS OF THEIR OWN AND OF COURSE THE REST OF THE BUSINESS NEWS THANK YOU MUCH AND IT GETS THE THINGS WE DO KNOW ABOUT THERESA MAY SUGGEST THAT ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT SHE MIGHT NOT BE QUITE WHAT WAS EXPECTED
SHE'S EMBRACING QUITE IF WING IDEAS SHE WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE THE POWER TO STOP TAKE OVER BIDS TO GIVE SHAREHOLDERS BINDING VOTES ON EXECUTIVE PAY AND TO PUT EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES ON BOARDS SHE'S ALSO SAID SHE WILL SCRAP GEORGE OSBORNE'S PLAN THAT'S FOR A BUDGET SURPLUS BY TWENTY TWENTY WILL IT SEE IF WE CAN GENERATE SOME IDEAS FOR HER IN HER FIRST THEIR POWER WITH ME FROM A CHELMSFORD STUDIOS IS ANDREW SENTENCE A FORMER MEMBER OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
COMMITTEE ANOTHER SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISER AT THE ACCOUNTANTS P.W.C. AND WITH ME IS JONATHAN PORTERS IN THE STUDIO DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH AND IF I COULD START WITH YOU WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID WAS TO DITCH THE SURPLUS TIGER OFFER OF GEORGE OSBORNE
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF FISCAL POLICY ECONOMIC GROWTH NOW LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SO STRONG OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WITH THE EXTRA UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY LEAVING THE E.U. BUSINESS CONFIDENCE WEAKENED THEIR SCIENCE THAT INVESTMENT MAY BE WEAKENING AND SO IT'S NATURAL IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO BE HIGHER
AND IT MADE THEM BE DIFFICULT TO GET IT DOWN TO A SURPLUS BY TWENTY TWENTY I THINK THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET WAS ALWAYS TO SOME EXTENT RATHER ARTIFICIAL I THINK THE MAIN THING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT OVER THE MEDIUM TERM OVER FIVE TO TEN YEARS THE BUDGET DEFICIT IS COMING DOWN THE EXACT DATE OF TWENTY TWENTY IT'S NOT THAT SACROSANCT WHAT SHE SHOULD DO THEY WHAT TO BE FIRST ON HER AGENDA WHEN SHE SETTING UP A NEW ECONOMIC POLICY
I THINK THIS TO ER TO BROAD THINGS FIRST OF ALL SHIFTING THE EMPHASIS IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING AWAY FROM THESE BIG PRESTIGE PROJECTS PARTICULARLY H. S. TWO AND IT MAY STILL GO AHEAD BUT TRYING TO PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON SMALLER PROJECTS THAT CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER BENEFITS IN THE SHORT TERM THAT CAN BE COMPLETED WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS OR THREE YEARS AND THEREFORE WE CAN SEE THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF BOWS BY TWENTY TWENTY
AND SECONDLY I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE EMPHASIS ON WHAT ECONOMISTS CALL SUPPLY SIDE MEASURES WHICH ARE THINGS THAT HELP BUSINESS BUT DON'T NECESSARILY COST THE GOVERNMENT MONEY REDUCING THE BURNED AND REGULATION ON BUSINESS RELAXING PLANNING CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING AND SMALL BUSINESS AND CRUCIALLY GIVING THE GO AHEAD FOR AIRPORT EXPANSION IN THE SOUTH EAST WHICH CAN BE DONE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR
IT CAN'T BE DONE AT HEATHROW THEN CAT WHICH WILL BE GIVEN THE GO AHEAD BUT IF WE REACHING OUT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IT'S CRAZY THAT WE CAN'T BUILD ANOTHER RUNWAY IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND SO DO SOME MORE SPINNING BUT DO IT ON THINGS WILL ACTUALLY GET THE ECONOMY GOING QUICKLY I'M NOT SURE IT ACTUALLY MEANS
VERY MUCH EXTRA SPENDING I THINK SHIFTING THE EMPHASIS AWAY SLIGHTLY AWAY FROM THESE LONGER TERM PROJECTS LIKE H. S. TWO TWO SHORTER TERM PROJECTS WHICH WILL ACTUALLY DELIVER BENEFITS WITHIN TWO TO THREE YEARS
JONATHAN IF I COULD BRING YOU IN NOW WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE BUDGET SURPLUS TIGER I THINK YOU'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF WAS IT WAS A BIT OF A FOLLY REALLY I SAID AT THE TIME IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS SIMPLY NOT CREDIBLE IN THE ECONOMIC SENSE IT WOULD NOT SURVIVE IN A MILD AND IT INDEED IT HASN'T EVEN SURVIVED THE PROSPECT OF A DOWNTURN THERE WAS NO ECONOMIC LOGIC TO IT WHATSOEVER
IT'S ABANDONMENT IS ENTIRELY WELCOME OF COURSE AS ANDREW SAYS THE GOVERNMENT DOES NEED A MEDIUM TERM FISCAL POLICY THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THERESA MAY AND HER NEW CANCER WILL ADOPT SOME VERSION OF THE POLICY THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED BY OTHER PARTIES IN THE DEED LOTS OF OTHER ECONOMIST THAT IS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET
ON A CURRENT BASIS BUT TO BORROW SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOR INVESTMENT SPENDING OR THEY WERE SURE GO FOR POLICY WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE SHOULD DO SHE'S SHOULD SHE'D BE BORROWING AT THE MOMENT SO CHEAP TO BORROW AT THE MOMENT IT'S EXTREMELY CHEAP TO BORROW AT THE MOMENT IN FACT WITH INTEREST RATES AT THEIR LOWER GOVERNMENT BORROWING RATES AT THEIR LOWEST LEVEL IN RECORD ECONOMIC HISTORY WHEN I SAY THAT I MEAN GOING BACK
THREE THOUSAND YEARS NOT JUST A FEW DECADES IT'S CLEAR WHAT THE MARKETS ARE TELLING US THE MARKET TELLING US THAT THE GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO BE BORROWING AND IT OUGHT TO BE SPENDING ON A PRINT WITH HER AND YOU MIGHT EXPECT THERESA MAY COMING FROM A SLIGHTLY DRY CONSERVATIVE BACKGROUND
WOULD NOT BE IN FAVOUR OF THAT BUT WHAT SHE HAS SAID ABOUT ECONOMIC POLICY SHE'S ACTUALLY PINCH SOME QUITE LEFT WING IDEA SAY DIFFERENT SHE MIGHT BE IN FAVOUR OF OF SPINNING A LOT MORE BORROWING AND SPENDING WELL I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT BORROWING AND SPENDING ON PUBLIC INVESTMENT WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE LEVELS IS A PARTICULARLY LEFT OR RIGHT WING OUT IDEA IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE GAUDY COMMONSENSE AND I AGREE WITH ANDREW ACTUALLY TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ABOUT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ABOUT CONCENTRATING ON THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE RELATIVELY QUICKLY SO FOR INSTANCE YOU COULD ALLOW
COUNCILS AND HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS TO TO BUILD HOUSES IF AS ANDREW ALSO SAYS YOU RELAX BY ANY RELATIONS YOU COULD DO ALL OF THAT ACTUALLY QUITE QUICKLY YOU WANNA DRESS ONE OF THE U.K.'S BIGGEST PROBLEMS OF COURSE WHICH IS THE SHORTAGE OF HAS ANDREW WHAT ABOUT THEIR POINT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE BORROWING MORE IT'S THERE IT'S THERE WE HAVE THE LOWEST BORROWING COS SINCE THE STONE AGE
WELL I THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF SCALE I THINK WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE SORT OF LEVELS OF BORROWING THAT WE HAD AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THEY WERE UNSUSTAINABLE AND WE'RE STILL NOT REALLY AT A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF BORROWING AT THE MOMENT AND BORROWING COULD WELL GO UP IF THE ECONOMY WEAKENS AS MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS BECAUSE OF LACK OF CONFIDENCE AND UNCERTAINTY
SO IT'S A QUESTION I THINK MORE OF SHIFTING THEIR PRIORITIES WITHIN GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND PARTICULAR WITHIN INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING YES A LITTLE BIT MORE EXTRA SPENDING BUT THAT WILL HAVE TO BE CLAWED BACK AT SOME POINT BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO GET THE BORROWING LEVEL DOWN TO A LOWER LEVEL EVEN IF WE FOLLOW THE RULE THAT JONATHAN'S TALKING ABOUT CAN JUST JUST CHANGING TACK PRIM AND LOOKING AHEAD TO THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE TOMORROW AND DO WE HAVE AN INTEREST RATE DECISION
NOT A CRITICISM OF MARK CARNEY THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND FOR TYING THE HANDS OF THE M.P. SEE IF YOU WERE STILL ON THE P.C. WOULD YOU FEEL THAT YOU'D BEEN STRONG ARMED INTO A RATE CUT
NO I I'VE I'VE NEVER BEEN A STRONG ARMED BY ANYBODY I VOTED AGAINST THE GOVERNOR FOR ABOUT A YEAR WHEN I WAS ON THE M. P. C. I THINK THE JOB OF THE M.P.C. IS FOR EACH MEMBER TO MAKE AN INDEPENDENT JUDGEMENT AND IF I WAS MAKING MIND DEPENDENT JUDGEMENT I WOULDN'T BE VOTING FOR A RATE CUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO ACHIEVE VERY MUCH INTEREST RATES ALREADY VERY LOW AND ACTUALLY STABILITY AND MONETARY POLICY IS PROBABLY WHAT WE NEED NOW AND JONATHAN JUST QUICKLY DO YOU THINK A RATE CUT THIS LIKELY AND WHEN WOULD YOU GO FOR ONE
I THINK I PROBABLY WOULD ALTHOUGH I DO AGREE WITH ANDREW THAT IT ACTUALLY WILL HAVE LIMITED IMPACT AT THE MOMENT AND MEASURES TO IMPROVE CONFIDENCE ACTUALLY TO TAKE ACTION ON ON SETTING OUT WHAT THE NEW FISCAL POLICY SOME EXTRA SPENDING IN THE SHORT TERM AT LEAST ON PUBLIC INVESTMENT WILL ACTUALLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN BOOST IN CONFIDENCE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO EVERY SENTENCE OF PETER AND JONATHAN PORTRAITS FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH WILL ONE THING TERESA MAKE WON'T WHICH PREVIOUS PRIME MINISTERS COULD RELY ON HIS LOTS OF TAX REVENUE FROM THE NORTH SEA THAT OIL PRICE MEANS MOST PRODUCE THAT THEY ARE MAKING ANY MONEY SO CAN'T PAY MUCH TAX IN FACT THE FORECASTS OTHER NORTH SEA TAX REVENUE WILL FALL TO ZERO QUITE SOON
# THERE'S A BIG STRIKE BALLOT TODAY AMONGST OFFSHORE WORKERS AT WOOD GROUP WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIG PROVIDERS OF OF THE WORKFORCE TO THE NORTH SEA IT'S CUT PAY BY ONE FIFTH AND MADE OFF THOUSANDS OF STAFF WITH ME IS RICHARD MALLINSON FROM AN ANALYST ENERGY ASPECTS RICHARD THIS IS ALL PART OF QUITE A GRIM OUTLOOK FOR THE NORTH SEA ISN'T IT
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ESSENTIALLY THE NORTH SEA IS ONE OF THE HIGH COST AREAS OF PRODUCTION AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT MEANS ONLY MAKES SENSE TO INVEST IN PERIODS OF SUSTAINED HIGH OIL PRICES AND ALTHOUGH WE'VE SEEN A RECOVERY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THE LOWS IN JANUARY THERE'S VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE SO MUCH SO FAR IN THE INDUSTRY
WE'RE GOING TO SEE HIGHER OIL PRICES TO COME OR A SUSTAINED PERIOD AND SO COMPANIES SIMPLY AREN'T SPENDING MONEY AND THAT MEANS PRODUCTIONS LIKE FALLEN AS YOU'VE MENTIONED TAX REVENUES HAD BEEN HIT VERY HARD YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT KNOW FROM TIME TO TIME BUT A RENAISSANCE IN THE NORTH SEA BEER WASTE OF SHETLAND DEVELOPMENTS ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF BUT THESE ARE PRETTY SMALL COMPARED WITH WHAT WENT BEFORE AREN'T THEY
WHAT WE'RE STILL SEEING IS THE THE LAST PROJECT FROM A WAVE OF INVESTMENT WHEN OIL PRICES WERE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ABOUT THEY'RE COMING THROUGH NOW BECAUSE THEY TAKE THREE FOUR YEARS BUT IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT THEM TODAY WITH THE ECONOMICS MAKE SENSE TO START THEM ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO MUCH THERE THAT CAN BE DONE TINS OF TEXT STIMULATION THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISM BECOME AS VERY SLOW TO CUP CUT THE TAX RATES ON NORTH SEA PRODUCES IT COULD THEY DO MUCH MORE IS THAT REALLY JUST FIDDLING AT THE MARGINS
WELL OBVIOUSLY EVERY TIME PRICES FALL YOU YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE INDUSTRY LOBBYING FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE TAX REGIME YOU COULD DO A LITTLE BIT THERE BUT I THINK THE REALITY IS AROUND THE WORLD WE'VE SEEN THIRTY FIVE FORTY PERCENT OF GLOBAL CAP IT'S CUT IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS UNTIL THE COMPANIES WANT TO SPEND AGAIN AND UNTIL PRICES ARE HIGHER IT'LL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE U.K. GOVERNMENT OR MAYBE POST AN INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THE CASE THAT NORTH SEA OIL IS AN ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT
NOW OIL TRADERS WILL BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT AN INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY REPORT OUT TODAY IT'S A IT'S A REGULAR UPDATE ON THE STATE OF YOUR MARKET ONE OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT IT IS THAT THE MIDDLE EAST PRODUCES A TRADITIONAL PRODUCERS ARE GRABBING BACK MARKET SHARE IN THIS ERA OF LOW OIL PRICES AREN'T THEY YOU THINK THEY'LL BE BORNE OUT TODAY
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG TRENDS THE CONTINUING TO HIGHLIGHT SO WE'LL SEE SAUDI ARABIA'S PRODUCTION IT'S RISING TOWARDS ITS SUMMER PECAN DEMAND THAT THE THEY COUNTRIES ALSO BEEN PUSHING MORE OIL OUT ALONGSIDE IRAN WHICH HAS COME BACK FROM SANCTIONED THIS YEAR HAS BEEN EXPORTING A LOT MORE SO YES CERTAINLY THOSE MIDDLE EASTERN PRODUCER SENDING MORE OIL TO ASIA THERE IS GROWTH IN DEMAND THERE IN PARTICULAR FROM INDIA
BUT IT'S STILL COMPETITIVE BETWEEN THE PRODUCERS ABOUT WHO GETS TO LOCK IN THAT AND THE LONG TERM PICTURE IS STILL AN OIL WELL A RELATIVE OIL GLUT HIGH PRICES ARE GOING TO STAY LOW FOR QUITE A LONG TIME I DON'T THINK SO AND I WOULD SAY THE I.A.E.A. HAS CHANGED THEIR TUNE QUITE A BIT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'RE LOOKING NOW AT A MUCH MORE BALANCED MARKET FOR THE SECOND HALF THIS YEAR INTO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE'S UM
BIG DISAGREEMENT STILL ABOUT THE PACE OF THAT REBALANCING BUT I THINK EVERYONE NOW ACCEPTS THAT THE SCALE OF THE CLOT HAS COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY THAT PROCESS WAS ACCELERATED BY THE WILDFIRES IN CANADA BY THEIR LOSSES IN NIGERIA BUT IT'S ALSO A STRUCTURAL THING LOWER PRICES LOW INVESTMENT HAVE REDUCED SUPPLIES WHILE DEMAND HAS BEEN DOING WELL
IT'S THAT CAMP CARRIES ON WE'RE IN A MUCH MORE BALANCED MARKETING OIL PRICES MIGHT START TO MOVE FINALLY MAYBE A FEW MONTHS OF WEAKNESS BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND BRECK'S IT BUT THEN I THINK AS WE GET TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR WE'LL SEE PRICES GOING UP FURTHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH RICHARD AND ALLISON OF ENERGY ASPECTS
# IT'S BRINGING A MARKET SCARCER MAIN CUPBOARDY FROM IT IS AHEAD OF EQUITY RESEARCH IT BURNT OFF AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT THEY ALL PRICE OF COURSE HANGS OVER MANY THINGS DOESN'T IT A LAME BUT IT'S MADE OUT OF OIL INTO FASHION AND THE TRADING UPDATE TODAY FROM BURBERRY YESTERDAY THEY REARRANGE THE HAD BROUGHT SOME EXCUSE ME THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY THEY REARRANGE THE TOP MANAGEMENT CHRISTOPHER BAILEY SLIGHTLY SIDELINED THEY WILL BE HAD BY DEMAND FALLING IN CHINA AND THE POUND'S WEAKNESS WAITING WE SHOULD HELP THEM
IT COULD DO YES I MEAN THIS MORNING WE SAW LIKE FOR LIKES DOWN AROUND FIVE PER CENT ARE PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH WITH EXPECTATIONS AS YOU SAID WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF BOARD CHANGES THE PREVIOUS CREATIVE DESIGNER WAS ALSO THE SEE I THINK THAT WAS POSITION WAS PROVING TO BE UNTENABLE SO THEY'VE BROUGHT IN A NEW SEA AND INVENTED A NEW TITLE OF PRESIDENT AND CREATIVE DESIGNER
BUT I THINK THE PROBLEMS FACING BURBERRY MORE SORT OF LONG TERM AND DIFFICULT AND HARD FOR THEM TO OVERCOME THEIR NOT NECESSARILY CONSIDERED TO BE A TOP LINE LUXURY GOODS LIKE COMPANY LIKE PRIOR DREW L.V.M.H. AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO TRY AND KEEP UP WITH
CHANGING DEMAND PROFILES AND THE BRICKS OF VOTE WAS MEANT TO HAVE KILLED OFF DEALS BUT WE DID HAVE ONE YESTERDAY WHICH WAS PURCHASED BY A BIG CHINESE CONGLOMERATE OF GUY HANDS AS CINEMA CHAIN THE ODEON CINEMA CHAIN HOWEVER THIS IS PERHAPS SIGN OF ANOTHER WEAKNESS CAUSE
MY HANDS WAS PLANNING TO FLOAT THIS ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE INSTEAD HE SOLD IT TO A CHINESE BUYER HASN'T HE YES I THINK HE WAS PLANNING ORIGINALLY FOR A FOR AN I.P.O. OF THIS WE'VE STEPPED CERTAINLY SEEN THE I.P.O. MARKETS SLOW DOWN THIS YEAR AND I THINK UNTIL WE GET A BIT MORE CERTAINTY ON THE OUTLOOK THAT COULD CONTINUE YES INTERESTING TO SEE CHINESE BUYERS MOVING INTO THIS MARKER THERE ARE SOME BARGAINS TO BE HAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH ELAINE COVERLY OF BREWIN DOLPHIN

RADIO FOUR WITH MICHELLE A SANE AND NICK ROBINSON AND CHARLES CARROLL HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS DAVID CAMERON WILL FACE M.P.S IN THE COMMONS THIS LUNCH TIME FOR HIS LAST PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS HE'LL LEAVE DOWNING STREET AFTER SIX YEARS AS PRIME MINISTER TO FORMALLY OFFER HIS RESIGNATION TO THE QUEEN PAVING THE WAY FOR TERESA MADE TO TAKE OFFICE IT'S THOUGHT A NUMBER OF WOMEN ARE IN LINE FOR A SENIOR ROLES IN THE NEW CABINET
# A SECOND LABOUR M.P. HE IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTION TODAY TO RUN FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY THE FORMER SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY OWEN SMITH WILL JOIN ANGELA EAGLE IN CHALLENGING JEREMY CORBIN MEDICAL STAFF IN ENGLAND HAVE BEEN TOLD TO TREAT SEPSIS WITH THE SAME URGENCY AS A SUSPECTED HEART ATTACK THE CONDITION WHICH DEVELOPS WHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM GOES INTO OVERDRIVE WHILE TRYING TO FIGHT AN INFECTION IS THOUGHT TO CAUSE AS MANY AS TEN THOUSAND AVOIDABLE DEATHS EVERY YEAR
# RECOVERY EFFORTS ARE CONTINUING IN SOUTHERN ITALY FOLLOWING YESTERDAY'S HIGH SPEED RAIL CRASH AT LEAST TWENTY THREE PEOPLE DIED WHEN TWO PASSENGER TRAINS COLLIDED ON A REMOTE STRETCH OF LINE NEAR THE CITY OF BARI AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HAS ACCUSED THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE USING WIDESPREAD FORCED DISAPPEARANCE TO CRUSH POLITICAL DISSENT IT SAYS THAT HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS AND POLITICAL ACTIVISTS HAVE VANISHED WITHOUT TRACE SINCE EARLY LAST YEAR
# THE CHILDREN'S CHARITY THE N.S.P.C.C. IS URGING THE GOVERNMENT TO CLOSE A LEGAL LOOPHOLE TO ENSURE THAT PRIVATE TUTORS WHO WORK WITH CHILDREN OR SUBJECT TO COMPULSORY CRIMINAL RECORD CHECKS IT'S ESTIMATED THAT AROUND A QUARTER OF CHILDREN IN THE U.K. HAVE TUITION OUTSIDE SCHOOL

# AND M.P.S SAY THE GOVERNMENT IS BADLY LETTING DOWN SERVICE PERSONNEL BY PROVIDING THEM WITH POOR QUALITY ACCOMMODATION AND OFTEN LEAVING THEM WITHOUT BASIC THINGS SUCH AS HOT WATER AND HEATING THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS MILITARY HOUSING HAS BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE OVER THE LAST YEAR
# THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHANCE IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN AND IT IS MAY DAY THE DAY WE GET A NEW PRIME MINISTER AND SHE HAS TO BEGIN TO ASSEMBLE HER NEW TOP TEAM NORMAN SMITH OR ASSOCIATE POLITICAL EDITOR WILL HAVE ANOTHER VERY BUSY DAY TAKE US THROUGH THE CHOREOGRAPHY WILLIE NORMAN OF DAVID CAMERON'S DEPARTURE AND MISSUS MAY'S ARRIVAL
IT ALREADY BEGINS I THINK WITH PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS MISTER CAMERON'S LAST ONE NOT THE USUAL SORT OF POLITICALLY CHARGED EVENT THERE SOME MORE I REFLECTED MAYBE EVEN LIGHT HEARTED MOMENT WHEN M.P.S CAN PAY TRIBUTES TO THE PRIME MINISTER THERE MISTER CAMERON I IMAGINE WILL WANT TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME IN THE COMMONS SAYING THANK YOU TO COLLEAGUES
AND THEN HE GOES BACK TO DOWNING STREET WHERE HE WILL SAY FAREWELL TO STAFF BEFORE MAKING THE JOURNEY TO THE PALACE TO HAND IN HIS RESIGNATION TO THE QUEEN AND THEN A SHORT TIME LATER THERESA MAY WILL MAKE THE SAME JOURNEY BEFORE RETURNING TO DOWNING STREET AND EXPECT MAKING A STATEMENT ON THE STEPS WHEN SHE WE'LL SKETCH OUT HER VISION HER AMBITIONS AND I THINK WE ALL WANT TO
CHART A DIFFERENT COURSE TO SIGNAL THAT SHE IS DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT TO DAVID CAMERON THEN OF COURSE SHE HAS TO GET DOWN TO THE HARD BUSINESS OF FORMING A NEW GOVERNMENT ONE THING WE HAVE BEEN BRIEFED OVERNIGHT IS TO EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN THE CABINET INCLUDING IN THE VERY AND THE MOST SENIOR POSTS SO I WOULD IMAGINE WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE A WOMAN EITHER AS CHANCELLOR OR FOREIGN SECRETARY OR OR DEFENCE SECRETARY
AND ALSO WE HAVE BEEN TOLD TOP PRIORITY HAS BEEN GIVEN TO APPOINTING THIS NEW BRA EXIT MINISTER TO HANDLE OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH EUROPE AND THE SEARCH HAS ALREADY BEGUN FOR A BUILDING TO HOUSE THE NEW BRICKS AT DEPARTMENT IT'S WORTH SAYING ISN'T IT NORMAN THAT WHEN WE TALK OF HER CHOOSING HER NEW TEAM SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A TEAM OF ASSISTANTS READY TO GO INTO DOWNING STREET IN THE SENSE THAT
A LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION HAS MONTHS YEARS MAYBE TO PREPARE IF SHE'D BEEN RUNNING IN THE LEADERSHIP CONCERT SHE WOULD HAVE HAD NINE WEEKS TO PREPARE SHE'S HAD A BAD DAY AND A HALF EVERYTHING HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY ACCELERATED BY THE ABORTED LEADERSHIP CONTESTS AND THAT DOES PUT HUGE HUGE PRESSURE ON MISSUS MADE TO CONSTRUCT A NEW GOVERNMENT BUT
THE ONE PLUS THAT SEEMS TO ME AND IT IS A BIG PLUS BY THE FACT THERE ISN'T THIS LEADERSHIP CONTEST IT DOES AT LEAST BUY HER TIME TO WORK OUT HER STRATEGY WITH REGARD TO EUROPE WHICH LET'S FACE IT HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO SHAPE
DEFINE AND MAKE OR BREAK HER PREMIERSHIP BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS SHE FACES MANY WAVES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS DAVID CAMERON IN SOME WAYS MORE PROFOUND BUT PERHAPS MOST PRESSING IS THE FACT BEHIND HER IS A LARGE TRANCHE OF REBELLIOUS BRECK'S A TEAR CONSERVATIVE M.P.S WHO WILL BE WATCHING HER LIKE A HAWK FOR ANY SIGN OF COMPROMISE BACKSLIDING AND IF THERE IS THEN I THINK THERE IS ABSOLUTE THE POT ABSOLUTELY THE SAME POSSIBILITY
THIS MADE FACING THE DIFFICULT IT'S MISTER CAMERON FACED IN TERMS OF GETTING LEGISLATION THROUGH PERPETUAL REBELLION IN FACT PROBABLY WORSE BECAUSE I IMAGINE MANY OF THEM NOW HAVE A TASTE FOR REBELLION JUST A QUICK ONE MOMENT SHE COULD PLEASE THEM I SUSPECT BY WAVING GOODBYE TO A SECOND PERSON FROM DOWNING STREET AND THAT IS GEORGE OSBORNE
I THINK THAT IS PERHAPS BECOMING INCREASINGLY LIKELY I HAVE TO SAY THAT WAS A LOT OF SPECULATION YESTERDAY THAT MAYBE HE WILL MOVE TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND I THINK HE'S PROBABLY HOLDING OUT FOR THAT I DON'T THINK HE'D ACCEPT A LOWER ROLE IN GOVERNMENT BUT THE FACT IS SHE HE HAS BECOME ALMOST A LIGHTNING ROD FOR ALL THE ANGER FELT OVER THE WAY THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WAS FORD ADDED TWITCH MISSUS MAY HERSELF IN HER LAUNCH SPEECH JUST THE OTHER DAY IT SEEMED TO ME
TOOK QUITE A DELIBERATE SWIPE AT MISTER OSBORNE SAYING THERE'VE BEEN PLENTY OF PUBLIC SERVICE BUT THERE HADN'T BEEN MUCH DEEP ECONOMIC REFORM AND I THOUGHT SHE ALSO SEEM TO PLAY DOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF DEFICIT REDUCTION SO I SUSPECT WE MAY INDEED TO SEE A NEW CHANCELLOR AND PERHAPS MISTER OSBORNE MAY BE ON ITS WAY OUT NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU
# THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE HEALTH WATCHDOG FOR ENGLAND IS ISSUING GUIDANCE ON SEPSIS FOR THE FIRST TIME TELLING STAFF TO CONSIDER IT FOR ALL PATIENTS WHO APPEAR TO HAVE A SERIOUS INFECTION JANE DRAPER HE'S OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT EXPLAIN FIRST WHAT IT IS JANE YET SEPSIS HAPPENS IT IT'S A FORM OF BLOOD POISONING AND IT DEVELOPS WHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS TRYING TO FIGHT AN INFECTION BUT IT RUNS OUT OF CONTROL AND IT CAN GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT ATTACKS ORGANS CAUSING DAMAGE
AND IT CAN EVEN KILL PEOPLE IN IT IN FACT KILLS MORE PEOPLE EVERY YEAR THAN BREAST BOWEL AND PROSTATE CANCER COMBINED SO THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IT'S A LIFE THREATENING CONDITION BUT IT'S DIFFICULT DIAGNOSED WITH CERTAINTY SO THESE GUIDELINES TODAY ARE AN ATTEMPT TO HELP DOCTORS AND NURSES THROUGH THAT'S WHY DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE BECAUSE THE SYMPTOMS ARE EASILY CONFUSED WITH THOSE OF OTHER CONDITIONS THEY CAN BE QUITE VAGUE AND THEY DON'T PRESENT IN THE SAME WAY IN
THE PATIENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT HAVE A FAST HEARTBEAT BUT YOU MIGHT NOT YOU MIGHT HAVE A VERY HIGH OR LOW TEMPERATURE BUT YOU MIGHT NOT OR YOU MIGHT HAVE A FEVER SO WHAT THIS GUIDANCE DOES IS SET OUT SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS IN CLEAR TABLES TO HELP MEDICAL STAFF
LOOK AT THE RISK AND ASSESS IT ALSO BASED ON PEOPLE'S AGE BECAUSE THAT IS A FACT OR IF YOU'RE VERY YOUNG OR VERY OLD YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH SEPSIS AND WHETHER YOU'RE PRESENTING IN A SURGERY OR A HOSPITAL WHETHER YOU'VE HAD A RECENT OPERATION SO JUST TO REALLY TRY AND NARROW DOWN SOME OF THESE FACTORS THAT WILL HELP SPEEDY DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE IT CAN BE TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS IF IT'S DETECTED EARLY ENOUGH AND AT THE MOMENT IT SEEMS ARE AS MANY AS
TEN THOUSAND AVOIDABLE DEATHS FROM THIS EVERY YEAR YES THAT'S RIGHT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND DEATHS IN ALL EVERY YEAR BUT A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH PROBLEMS WHICH WERE PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE THEIR LIVES ANYWAY BUT YES AT A HUGE
AMOUNTS UP TO TEN THOUSAND THAT ARE AVOIDABLE SO THERE'S A HUGE GAME IF THIS GUIDANCE IS FOLLOWED THROUGH AND ACTED UPON AND THIS SUCH AS THIS REALLY ZOOMED UP THE AGENDA THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE REPORTS ONE BY THE HEALTH SERVICE OMBUDSMAN ALSO AN OFFICIAL NATIONAL ENQUIRY LAST YEAR AND THEN IN JANUARY A WOMAN CALLED MELISSA MEAD WHO'S ONE YEAR OLD SON WILLIAM DIED AFTER A SERIES OF MISSED OPPORTUNITIES
BY THE N.H.S. WHICH DIDN'T MANAGE TO SPOT AND DETECTIVE SEPSIS SHE SHOWED GREAT ELOQUENCE AND SPEAKING OUT AND I THINK IT REALLY SORT OF CAPTURED A MOMENT SO THIS HAS BECOME VERY IMPORTANT WILL BE SPEAKING TO HER LATER IN THE PROGRAMME AND TO THE PROFESSOR WHO HELPED THE WATCHDOG NICE DEVELOPED THESE NEW GUIDELINES ARE JANE DRAPER THANK YOU NINETY MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS
AND MISSUS MAY'S DRIVE FOR MORE WOMEN IN HER CABINET THAT'S HOW THE GUARDIAN PUTS IT IN ITS LEAD THE PAPER SAYS THAT ALLIES INCLUDING AMBER RUDD AND JUSTINE GREENING ARE AMONGST THOSE EXPECTED TO BE IN LINE FOR PROMINENT POSITIONS AS THERESA MAY BECOMES PRIME MINISTER MAZE WOMEN ON THE MARCH IS THE HEADLINE FOR THE MALE WHICH BELIEVE MISSUS RUDD COULD BE HOME SECRETARY OR EVEN CHANCELLOR THE PAPER'S POLITICAL EDITOR AT LARGE ISABELLA SHOT THE NEW PRIME MINISTER IS ALSO UNDER PRESSURE TO OFFER GEORGE OSBORNE OR POLITICAL LIFELINE THE DISCREDITED CHANCELLOR
IS SHE SAYS DESTINED FOR THE FOREIGN OFFICE THE FINANCIAL TIMES THOSE SAYS SOME OF MISTER OSBORNE'S FRIENDS BELIEVE YOU MAY LEAVE GOVERNMENT IT SAYS PHILIP HAMMOND IS BACKED BY TORY M.P.S TO REPLACE HIM AT THE TREASURY BUT POINTS OUT THAT WHAT IT CALLS HIS HAWKISH FISCAL STANCE AND FREE MARKET APPROACH ARE AT ODDS WITH MISSUS MAY'S PLAN TO END AUSTERITY AND REIN IN CAPITALIST EXCESS THE TIMES IN ITS EDITORIAL WARNS MISSUS MAY THAT WHAT IT CALLS HER STRIKINGLY CENTRIST ALMOST LEFTIST ECONOMIC STRATEGY
RISKS DEPRESSING GROWTH AND DISCOURAGING INVESTMENT EXPRESS BELIEVES THAT MISSUS MAY WILL SEEK TO HEAL REFERENDUM WOUNDS BY APPOINTING BRICKS IT BACKING MINISTERS TO SENIOR ROLES WITH CHRIS GRAYLING EXPECTED TO GET ONE OF THE TOP JOBS POSSIBLY IT SAYS FOREIGN SECRETARY THE TELEGRAPH MEANWHILE BELIEVED THERESA MAY'S LIKELY TO WANT TO GIVE BORIS JOHNSON A PROMINENT POSITION AND QUOTES HIS FRIENDS ARE SAYING HE WANTS TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE
THERE IS MUCH COVERAGE TO OF THE DEPARTURE OF DAVID CAMERON WHO THE MALE BELIEVES HAS LEFT THE NATION IMMEASURABLY STRONGER THAN HE FOUND IT FOR THE SUN THOUGH MISTER CAMERON'S YEARS AS PRIME MINISTER WILL NOT BE LOOKED BACK ON KINDLY HE IS A DECENT MAN IT SAYS
# IT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT TO SHOW FOR HIS TIME IN DOWNING STREET THE MIRROR BELIEVES HE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS A FAILURE IT'S EDITORIAL DESCRIBES HIM AS AN ARROGANT MAN WHO CALLED A REFERENDUM TO FIX AN INTERNAL PARTY PROBLEM LABOUR WRIST BLOODY SPLIT AFTER CORBIN BEACH REBELS IS THE LEAD HEADLINE FOR THE TIMES AFTER JEREMY CORBIN ENSURED HIS NAME WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE ON THE BALANCE FOR A LEADERSHIP CONTEST BUT IT SAYS THERE WAS A BOOST FOR MODERATE TO PUSH THROUGH NEW RULES ON WHO WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE FOR THE EXPRESS LABOUR APPEARS ON THE BRINK OF MELT DOWN
AND THE RULING ANY SEA CAVED IN TO PRESSURE FROM WHAT IT CALLS MISTER CORBIN'S HARD LEFT SUPPORTERS AND THE PARTY'S MILITANT UNION PAYMASTERS KORBUT WINS ROUND ONE SAYS THE SUN WHICH SEES LAST NIGHT'S DECISION AS THE START OF A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF LABOUR AND FINALLY THE EYES AMONG SEVERAL PAPERS TO REVEAL WHAT IT TAKES TO GET A PRIME MINISTER AND THEIR FAMILY OUT OF DOWNING STREET AFTER A REMOVAL FIRM DELIVERED THREE HUNDRED THIRTY PACKING BOXES THIRTY ROLLS OF TAPE AND THREE ROLLS OF BUBBLE WRAP
# IT ALSO SAYS THE CAMERAS WEREN'T ACTUALLY LEAVE TODAY HAVING BEEN GIVEN MORE TIME TO FINISH PACKING THE MALE'S CARTOONIST MAC PICTURES MISSUS MAY CLIMBING INTO BED ALONGSIDE HER HUSBAND AND DAVID AND SAMANTHA CAMERON REMEMBER THIS IS ONLY UNTIL YOU FIND THE KEYS TO YOUR NEW PLACE SHE SAYS IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE TODAY DAVID CAMERON SIX YEARS AS PRIME MINISTER END TODAY AFTER HE ANSWERS M.P.S' QUESTIONS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WILL GO TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE TO OFFER HIS RESIGNATION
# MARK CARNEY THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND DENIED TRYING TO FRIGHTEN THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION WHEN HE FACED M.P.S PEAS YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT WHILE THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SAID A NEW E.U. UNIT WAS BEING SET UP TO BRING TOGETHER WHAT HE CALLED HER THE BRIGHTEST AND THE BEST HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HERE
ONE THING BOTH LEAVE AND REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS SAY IS THAT IT'S NOW TIME TO LOOK NOT BACK BUT TO THE FUTURE
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY BECAUSE WHEN THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY APPEARED BEFORE THE TREASURY COMMITTEE HE WAS CHALLENGED OVER WHETHER THE BANK HAD TAKEN SIDES IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BY ISSUING GLOOMY WARNINGS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF LEAVING MARK CARNEY INSISTED IT HAD BEEN HIS DUTY TO GIVE IT TO HER STRAIGHT
IF WE VIEW SOMETHING AS THE BIGGEST RISK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION A STATUTORY OBLIGATION TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO PARLIAMENT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THE TO THE PEOPLE'S UNITED KINGDOM TO COME STRAIGHT
HE SAID THE BANK MADE NO APOLOGY FOR DOING ITS JOB I CONSERVATIVE LEAVE SUPPORTER JACOB REES MOGG WAS STILL RATHER CROSS
DID THE BANK OF ENGLAND CONSIDER WHETHER IT WAS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO RISK RISK
BANK OF ENGLAND AND THE FINANCIAL POLICY COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE OF ITS STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITY IS PERFECTLY CAPER
STARTING IT DID SO WITH A PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVE AND ALTHOUGH IF WE BASED MAN IT DO YOUR CARS AROUND YOU LIKE MYSTERIES BUT I THINK THE QUESTION TO BE HONEST MY FILE BUT I THINK I THINK YOUR QUESTION WHICH US I THINK I THINK THE TWO CAST IT INTO QUESTION SHOULD CONSIDER
THEIR MOTIVATIONS AND THEIR JUDGEMENT WELL SO MUCH FOR THE PAST NOW TO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT AND FOR MANY YEARS LITTLE BRITISH LADS AND LASSES WHO DREAMED OF BECOMING TRADE NEGOTIATOR AS WHEN THEY GREW UP WOULD BE ANSWERED WITH HER BITTER SNORT FROM GRIZZLED OLD VETERANS WHO'D CHOMP ON THEIR PIPES AND TELL THEM NOT TO THINK OF IT THERE WAS NO FUTURE IN THE INDUSTRY THE WORK HAD ALL GONE OVERSEAS BUT NOW THEIR DREAMS COULD BE REALISED AT LAST
YES THE GOVERNMENT IS ACTIVELY SEEKING TO RECRUIT TRADE SPECIALISTS INCLUDING APPROACHING FORMER CIVIL SERVANTS WHO HAVE RETIRED OR MOVE TO THE PRIVATES
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND SIGNALLING A NEW DON EVEN FOR THOSE GRIZZLED OLD TIMERS UNTIL NOW OLD TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WERE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE Y. YOU HENCE THE NEED FOR THE U.K. TO RECRUIT SOME OF ITS OWN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES LABOUR'S JIM CUNNINGHAM FEARED THAT LIKE TOP FOOTBALLERS THEY'D BE ABLE TO NAME THEIR PRICE
TEL WHILE HE'S HOME MUCH THIS IS GOING TO COST
MISTER SPEAKER NOT AT THIS STAGE WHAT I CAN TELL HIM HE'S IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES FACING THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WE NOW DO
RECRUITMENT OF TRADE SPECIALISTS IS WHATEVER THAT COSTS US IS LIKELY TO BE AN INVESTMENT VERY WELL WORTH MAKING
FARMING AND CONSTRUCTION ARE AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S ANXIOUS STILL TO BE ABLE TO RECRUIT FROM OVERSEAS NOW TRADE NEGOTIATION HAS BEEN ADDED TO THAT LIST BY THE S.N.P. A COME ED SHAKE I HOPE THE SICH ESTATES IS IRONY IN THE FACT THAT THE VERY BEST IF I TAKE THE BULLSHITTERS I'D FACED IN
WE CAN PROVIDE A STUDENTS TO
FROM THAT I WANT MY BALL THEY DID BRING IN THE BEST TREAT NEGOTIATORS NOTWITHSTANDING
PHILIP HAMMOND WASN'T GOING TO BE CHAUVINISTIC ABOUT IT BUT HE HAD ONE CAVEAT I SEE NO REASON WHY WE WOULDN'T HIRE PEOPLE WHO WERE NON BRITISH
IF THEY WERE THE BEST PEOPLE TO DO THEIR JOB CLEARLY ONE WOULD NOT WANT TO HIRE THE CITIZEN OF ANOTHER COUNTRY TO NEGOTIATE A TROPHY WITH THAT COUNTRY
EARLIER A PHILIP HAMMOND HAD WELCOMED EMILY THORNBERRY SITTING OPPOSITE HIM TO HER NEW ROLE AS THE SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY BUT GIVEN JEREMY CORBIN'S DIFFICULTIES AND PUTTING TOGETHER A SHADOW GOVERNMENT HE NOTICED SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY JUST ONE OF THOSE SHADOW MINISTER
FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO WELCOME THE HONOURABLE LADY TO HER PLACE WITH HER
COMPACT TEAM A MODEL
MICHAEL I HOPE HAVE IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY IN THE U.K. ECONOMY
EMILY THORNBERRY AGREED THEY WERE A COMPACT BUT SHE SAID FORMIDABLE TEAM AND SHE WANTED IF SHE AND PHILIP HAMMOND WOULD CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS WAY
IF RUMOURS OF PROMOTION ARE TRUE THIS MAY BE MY FINAL SESSION WITH A SEXUAL ESTATE BEFORE HE DID
EVERYONE IS IN PHILIP HAMMOND WILFULLY MISUNDERSTOOD HER FIRST OF ALL I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR THE HONOURABLE LADY SAYING THAT SHE EXPECTS PROMOTION I THOUGHT THOSE THAT WERE EXPECTING PROMOTION THROUGH THEIR HAT IN THE RING YESTERDAY ON THE LABOUR PARTY SIDE THAT MAYBE SHE'S GOING TO BE A LATE ENTRANT TO THAT PARTICULAR COMPETITION
YOU I MEANT YOU EMILY THORNBERRY YELPED BUT HE PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE MAYBE LIFTING THE CURTAIN A LITTLE ON HIS OWN DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATING TECHNIQUE SUE'S NEW REPORTING THERE'S MORE OF COURSE FROM ESTON IN PARLIAMENT ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT
# THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THREE WEEKS TO GO TO THE OLYMPICS AND IN RIO THE BRITISH TEAM WILL BE HOPING BUT NOT NECESSARILY EXPECTING TO MATCH THE SIXTY FIVE MEDALS ACHIEVED IN LONDON IN TWENTY TWELVE ONLY THREE OF THOSE MEDALS WORTH A SWIMMING A SPORT THAT SOMEHOW FAILS TO FIRE THE IMAGINATION OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THE WAY THAT IT DOES IN THE UNITED STATES AND AUSTRALIA ROB ON IT HAS BEEN TO LONDON'S AQUATIC CENTRE TO CONSIDER WHY
PUBLIC POOLS CLOSING AND INHOSPITABLE OUTDOOR POOL CLIMB
INTERMITTENT SUCCESS AT ELITE LEVEL JUST THREE ELEMENTS THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN BRITAIN'S APPARENT INDIFFERENCE TO A SPORT WHOSE BACK PAGE APPEARANCES ON LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE FOR YOUR OLYMPIC CYCLE
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S THE LEGACY OF THIS MODERN AQUATIC CENTRE AT THE QUEEN ELIZABETH OLYMPIC PARK RISING PARTICIPATION AT AMATEUR LEVEL A RECENT DOMINANCE HERE IN LONDON AT THE EUROPEAN
SO CURRENT RESTAURANT WORLD CHAMPION ADAM P.T. FOUR TIMES A GOLD MEDALLIST IN LONDON TAKES THE OPTIMISTIC VIEW TIMMINS GET IN THERE
ON THE WHOLE PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW I'VE SAID THE TEAM'S BEEN REFRESHED AND PEOPLE GO
WHO WERE THESE GUYS AND AS YOU COME THROUGH AND YOU GET MORE SUCCESSFUL OVER THE YEARS I THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL GET BEHIND US
HOUSEHOLD NAMES YOU WANT PEOPLE TO RECOGNISE YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS YOU'RE IN SEARCH OF CELEBRITY STATUS RATHER THAN THE GOLD MEDAL
THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA HAVE SWIMMING STARS PHELPS MAGNUS AND EXCEPT FOR ROLE MODELS OF MEDIA CELEBRITIES WISE
AMONGST THE INITIATIVES TELEVISION'S DUEL IN THE PAUL BRITAIN VERSUS THE U.S.A. ACROSS DIFFERENT FORMATS IN THE STATES THEY LOVE IT BUT NOT
DAVID SPARKS IS BRITISH SWIMMING'S
WHEN WE PUT THAT PROPOSITION IN FRONT OF THE BROADCASTERS IN THE U.K. BUT THEY'RE LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC
I THINK THE BROADCASTERS IN THE U.K. SAY WELL WHERE DOES IT FIT IN WORLD SWIMMING EUROPEAN SWIMMING OLYMPIC GAMES MAYBE WHAT BRITISH BROADCASTERS ARE SAYING IS THAT TELEVISION IT'S DULL IT'S JUST ATE SPLASHES IN THE POOL
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS WHY WOULD N.B.C. THINK THIS IS GREAT T. V. N. GO PRIME TIME T. V. COAST TO COAST AND OTHER BROADCASTERS DECIDE THAT THIS IS DOLL
AND THAT MEDIA INDIFFERENCE HAS CONSEQUENCES SAYS DUNCAN GOODHEW ANOTHER IN A LONG LINE OF BRITISH BREASTSTROKE OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALLISTS HE'S FROM THE NINETEEN EIGHTY MOSCOW
TWO AND A HALF MILLION SWIMMING REGULARLY THERE'S MORE
FOOTBALL BY A LONG WAY BUT YET THEY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A CONNECT BETWEEN EXCELLENCE AND THE HEROES AND HEROINES AT THE TOP OF THEIR SPORT AND THE PEEP
MAYBE SWIMMING SHOULD TRY TO TAKE A LEAF OUT OF CYCLING SPORT WHERE THERE HAS BEEN THIS CONNECTION MADE BETWEEN PARTICIPATION AND LEISURE
STANDARDS ARE AT OLYMPIC GAMES AND WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT'S WHERE A COMMERCIAL SPOT
SMALL SHIP OF BOTH REAL LEAD AND ACROSS TO SEBACEAN MAN HAS MANAGED
INTERESTINGLY THROUGH THE RESULTS THEY'VE GOT FROM A MASS PARTICIPATION THAT
NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANTS TAKING PART IN THE VENTS HAVE GONE UP THE NUMBER OF THE FIGHTERS ON THE ROADS HAVE GONE UP AND OF COURSE
SO WILL THE OLYMPICS PROVIDE THE ROLE MODELS THAT PETEY AND OTHERS THAT SWIMMING
FINAL WORD WITH DAVID SPOTS WE'RE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC BUT THE U.S.A. ARE SO STRONG
AND ALSO WE'RE SEEING AUSTRALIA COMING BACK VERY STRONG INDEED BUT WE'LL BE THERE AND WILL BE PUSHING HARD FOR MEDALS AND WE BELIEVE WE'VE GOT THE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY DO
# IT IS NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN A RECORD NUMBER OF SO CALLED HATE CRIMES ARE RESULTING IN PROSECUTIONS IN THE COURTS THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE SAYS THAT HE'S HANDLING A GROWING NUMBER OF CRIMES MOTIVATED NOT JUST BY RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS HATRED BUT ALSO BY THOSE WHO TARGET THE DISABLED WERE JOINED BY THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS ALISON SAUNAS GOOD MORNING TO MORNING HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THE IS THE RISE
THE RICE IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE ARE NOW SEEN THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PROSECUTIONS EVER THAT WE HAVE PROSECUTED UNDER HATE CRIME STRANDS AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SHOWN INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN COMING FORWARD IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THE POLICIES AND THE TRAINING THAT WE PUT IN PLACE FOR PROSECUTORS HE'S WORKING WE'RE WORKING HARD WITH POLICE COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BUILD STRONG CASES THE OTHER FIGURE THAT'S I THINK GOOD NEWS FOR THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM THESE CRIMES IS THAT WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN OVER FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THOSE
AND OVER SEVENTY THREE PER CENT PLEA GUILTY WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT VICTIMS DON'T HAVE TO COME TO COURT TO GIVE EVIDENCE SO TRYING TO WORK OUT WHETHER THIS IS AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF THESE HATE CRIMES WHETHER IT'S INCREASED REPORTING HIS EYES SHE REALLY PRETTY DIFFICULT TO DO IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT SOME OF THIS IS BECAUSE THOSE INCREASED CONFIDENCE AND PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT ACTUALLY SOME OF THIS WHICH
ORDINARILY PEOPLE MIGHT JUST THINK THEY HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THEY DON'T IT IS A CRIME AND THEY CAN REPORT IT AND IT WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND SOME OF IT MAY POSSIBLY BE AN INCREASING OFFENCES OF SUCH WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD HATE CRIME WE TEND TO THINK FIRST I THINK OF RACE AND PERHAPS INCREASINGLY OF RELIGION HOW MUCH ARE THEY AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE HATE CRIMES THAT YOUR DEAL WITH
THEY ARE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY RACE AND RELIGIOUS HATE CRIME AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT WE SEE THE HIGHEST FIGURES AND TRADITIONALLY HAD SEEN THE HIGHEST FIGURES BUT WE ARE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BOTH HOMOPHOBIC TRANS PHOBIC CRIME AND DISABILITY HATE CRIME WHERE WE'VE SEEN THE LARGEST INCREASE AND THAT CERTAINLY WHERE WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TO REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REPORT AND GET PEOPLE TO RECOGNISE THAT SOME OF THE OFFENDING WHICH THEY
ALMOST TRADITIONALLY HAVE PUT UP WITH IS THE WRONG WORD BUT THEY'VE SORT OF GONE ALONG WITH THEY DON'T HAVE TO IT IS A CRIME AND THEY CAN REPORT IT IT IS A CRIME YOU SAY HOW CLEAR IS THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT WOULD BE ONE LEVEL MIA BANTER AT THE OTHER PRETTY OFFENSIVE ABUSE
AND WHERE DOES IT CROSS THE LINE INTO SOMETHING YOU WOULD ACTUALLY CALL NO THIS IS A CRIME A CRIME I MEAN THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE LEGISLATION IS THAT HATE CRIME IS A CRIME IF SOMEBODY PERCEIVES THERE TO BE HOSTILITY OR PREJUDICE AGAINST THEM SO IF WE KNOW THAT SOMEBODY IS ATTACKING AN INDIVIDUAL EITHER SORT OF PHYSICALLY OR ABUSIVELY BY THEIR LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE A CRIME IF THEY'RE SHOWN THE HOSTILITY OF THE PREJUDICE BECAUSE OF THEIR
PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS NOW THERE HAVE BEEN CLAIMS THAT THE E.U. REFERENDUM PRODUCED AN INCREASE IN HATE CRIME IT CLEARLY DID PRODUCE AN INCREASE IN REPORTING IS IMPOSSIBLE SAY ON WHAT SORT OF SCALE AND WHETHER YOU'RE EXPECTING HAS THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE TO HAVE MORE WASN'T ASIANS MAKE I MEAN I THINK THE NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF'S COUNCIL INDICATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A SPIKE
INI IN REPORTING HATE CRIME POST THE REFERENDUM WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE SOME OF THAT COME THROUGH TO US IN CHARGES WE KNOW WE ARE CHARGING MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER BEFORE SO WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THAT SPIKE REFLECTED TOO EARLY TO SAY WHETHER THAT HAS YET HAPPENED WHEN WE SOMETIMES HEAR THESE PERCENTAGES
WHAT IS A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF CRIMES CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DISTORTING AGAIN DO YOU GET A SENSE OF SCALE I MEAN CERTAINLY AS FAR AS SORT OF NUMBERS ARE CONCERNED WE ARE PROSECUTING MORE NUMBERS THAN EVER BEFORE AND ACROSS ALL THE STRANDS THAT WE RECORD THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP SO AS WELL AS THE PERCENTAGES SO AS FAR AS INCREASES TO COME I DON'T BEG ALISON SOWN AS DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND PHILIP AVERY IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER FORECAST
# THANKS VERY MUCH LET'S TAKE A FAIRLY BROAD BRUSH IF I MAY ACROSS THE WHOLE OF ENGLAND AND WALES THE LAST OF THE OVERNIGHT RAIN IS YET TO CLEAR FROM PARTS OF EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST AND WILL PROBABLY TAKE HALF A MORNING SO TO DO THEN THERE'S A BIT OF A LULL IN PROCEEDINGS
AND I'VE ALREADY LOOKING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO THE WEST BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PRETTY SHARP SHOWERS ALREADY ACROSS PARTS OF WESTERN WALES THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND ONE OR TWO STRAIGHT ONES INTO THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND TO THIS RAFT OF SHOWERS WILL GRADUALLY EASE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE MIDLANDS THROUGH CENTRAL SOUTHERN ENGLAND TOWARDS EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY PROBABLY NOT ROCKING UP INTO EAST ANGLIA THE SOUTHEAST UNTIL SORT OF AFTER LUNCHTIME SOME OF THESE REALLY QUITE SHARP
BUT THERE'S SOME SUNSHINE IN BETWEEN AND AS I'VE SORT OF SUGGESTED BEING THE NATURE OF SHOWERS SOME PEOPLE MISSED THESE ALTOGETHER AND I THINK YOU'VE GOT A BETTER CHANCE OF MISSING THEM IN THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND ONE OR TWO HERE PERHAPS AND FEWER PERHAPS THIS AFTERNOON TOO FOR PARTS OF THE NORTH WEST SO IT'S NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM TEMPERATURES IN THE MID UPPER TEENS FOR MOST OF US
TO NORTHERN IRELAND AND SOUTHERN AND WESTERN SCOTLAND WHERE THEY'RE ALREADY SHOWERS HERE TO BE HAD THESE TENDING TO BE A WEE BIT SHARPER THAN THOSE FURTHER SOUTH MIGHT EVEN HEAR THE ODD RUMBLE OF THUNDER LITTLE BIT MORE PREVALENT PERHAPS FOR A TIME COMING TOWARDS LUNCHTIME EARLY AFTERNOON BUT AGAIN SOME SUNSHINE IN BETWEEN AND AGAIN THE TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TEENS THE NORTH AND EASTERN SCOTLAND SHOULD SEE FEWER SHOWERS ORKNEY A WEE BIT OF SUNSHINE LESS OF A CHANCE PERHAPS FOR SHETLAND WHERE I THINK THERE'S GENERALLY MORE CLOUD SOME FOG AROUND

I'M MISTY ACCUSES THE JUDICIARY OF COMPLICITY AND SAYS THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE REPEATEDLY DENIED THAT ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES ARE HAPPENING CHINA HER STRONGLY CRITICISED THE PHILIPPINES AFTER A U.N. TRIBUNAL RULED THAT BEIJING'S TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN THE SOUTH CHANT RULED AGAINST BEIJING TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA THE DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ACCUSED MANILA OF STIRRING UP TROUBLE AND ACTING IN BAD FAITH
# RESCUE WORKERS ARE STILL AT THE SCENE OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL CRASH IN SOUTHERN ITALY IN WHICH AT LEAST TWENTY THREE PEOPLE DIED TWO PASSENGER TRAINS COLLIDED HEAD ON NEAR THE CITY OF BARI A REPORTER DAN JOHNSON IS
TEAMS HAVE WORKED THROUGH THE NIGHT CLEARING THE REMAINS OF THE WRECKED CARRIAGES FROM THE LINE THIS MORNING THEY KEEP PILING UP THE TWISTED METAL ONTO A SCRAP HEAP THAT GIVES SOME IDEA OF THE FORCE INVOLVED IN THIS IMPACT OCCASIONALLY WORKERS DISCOVER ANOTHER BODY
THE INVESTIGATION WILL FOCUS ON HOW TO TRAINS ENDED UP ON THE SAME TRACK SPEEDING TOWARDS EACH OTHER ITALY'S PRIME MINISTER MATTI OREN HE CAME HERE LAST NIGHT AND PROMISED THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES WOULD GET ANSWERS
# M.P.S SAY THE GOVERNMENT IS BADLY LETTING DOWN MEMBERS OF THE ARMED SERVICES BY PROVIDING THEM WITH POOR QUALITY ACCOMMODATION THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS FAMILIES HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT HEATING AND HOT WATER AND COOKING FACILITIES FOR MANY MONTHS AT A TIME IT WARNS THAT THE PROBLEM HAS GOT SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE OVER THE PAST YEAR
# THE GOVERNMENT IS BEING URGED TO CLOSE A LEGAL LOOPHOLE WHICH ALLOWS PRIVATE TUTORS TO WORK WITH CHILDREN WITHOUT BEING VETTED IT'S ESTIMATED THAT AROUND A QUARTER OF CHILDREN IN THE U.K. HAVE TUITION OUTSIDE SCHOOL BUT THOUSANDS OF SELF EMPLOYED TUTORS AREN'T SUBJECT TO COMPULSORY CRIMINAL RECORD CHECKS JOHN BROWN IS FROM THE N.S.P.C.C.
WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO DO WANT TO GET ACCESS TO CHILDREN FOR REASONS OF ABUSE AND EXPLOITATION WILL SEEK OPPORTUNITIES WHERE ARE ABLE TO BE ALONE WITH CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY BEING A PRIVATE TUTOR IS ONE EXAMPLE WHERE OF COURSE YOU DO YOU'RE IN A TRUSTED POSITION AND YOU CAN BE ALONE WITH THE CHILD
# THE HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON HEARSE ASKED VISITORS NOT TO PLAY THE NEW MOBILE PHONE GAME POKER MONT GO WHILE ON THE PREMISES SAYING THAT IT'S DISRESPECTFUL THE GAME HAS BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS SINCE IT WAS LAUNCHED FIVE DAYS AGO AND ALREADY HAS A SIMILAR NUMBER OF ACTIVE DAILY USERS AS TWITTER HERE'S A U.S. CORRESPONDENT PETER BOATS

# PETER BOWS REPORTING THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP BATTLE GOT EASIER FOR JEREMY CORBIN LAST NIGHT AFTER THE PARTY'S RULING EXECUTIVE DECIDED THAT HE DIDN'T NEED THE BACKING OF M.P.S TO HAVE HIS NAME ON THE BALLOT HE WILL HOWEVER HAVE MORE THAN ONE CHALLENGER WITH THE FORMER SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY OWEN SMITH EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT HE WILL STAND MISTER CORBIN HAS STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE GRASS ROOTS LABOUR MOVEMENT MOMENTUM
IT'S NATIONAL ORGANISER IS JAMES SCHNEIDER WHO'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THE OTHER PART OF THE ANY SEA DECISION YESTERDAY WAS THAT THOSE JOINING THE LABOUR PARTY AFTER THE TWELFTH OF JANUARY WILL NOT HAVE A VOTE IN THE LEADERSHIP CONTEST UNLESS THEY PAID TWENTY FIVE WITHIN TWO DAYS IS THAT FAIR I DON'T THINK THAT IS FAIR
THE LABOUR THE JOIN LABOUR MEMBERSHIP FORM ON THE WEBSITE HAS SAID IN THAT IT STILL SAID LAST TIME I CHECKED LAST NIGHT THAT IF HE JOINED THE LABOUR PARTY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE IN LABOUR LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS WE'VE SEEN SINCE THEIR BRECHT'S IT VOTE PROBABLY THE LARGEST SURGEON POLITICAL PARTY MEMBERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY WITH ALMOST ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE JOINING THE LABOUR PARTY AND A GREAT NUMBER OF THOSE WHO JOINED ON THE BASIS THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE IN A FUTURE LEADERSHIP ELECTION ANGELA EAGLE ON SUNDAY WHEN SHE WAS TOURING THE STUDIOS
WAS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO JOIN THE LABOUR PARTY TO VOTE FOR HER SO IT DOES IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH YOU PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING OF BEING ABLE TO VOTE IN A LEADERSHIP CONTEST IF YOU THINK THIS IS NOT FAIR WILL YOU BE CHALLENGING THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE DECISION WON'T BE FIRM MOMENTUM TO TO CHALLENGER BUT I'M SURE THERE'LL BE PEOPLE LOOKING AT IT YOU'VE HAD A
CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN DONATIONS HAVEN'T YOU AND MEMBERS MANY TODAY'S MOMENTUM YES YES WE HAVE WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING AROUND ELEVEN THOUSAND TODAY AND SMALL DONATIONS AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POUND THIRTY WOULD YOU CONSIDER USING SOME OF THAT MONEY TO GO TOWARDS THIS TWENTY FIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE LABOUR PARTY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT WE HAVE TO TAKE ADVICE ON WHETHER THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED I'M NOT SURE IS IT SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO DO
WE'D HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE PARTY'S RULES O.K. WELL THE POSITION THE PARTY IS IN TODAY IS THAT NOT ONLY HAS IT GOT AND ISSUE WITH HOW EFFECTIVE IT CAN BE IN PARLIAMENT TO GIVEN THE JEREMY CORBIN ONLY HAS THE SUPPORT OF TWENTY PER CENT OF HIS M. PEAS BUT THERE IS ALSO AN ISSUE ABOUT HOW IT OPERATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO LABOUR SOURCES HAVE TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT THE ANY SEAS HAD DECIDED TO SUSPEND ALL LOCAL PARTY MEETINGS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT HARASSMENT INTIMIDATION AND BULLYING
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT THEY HAVE SUSPENDED ALL LOCAL PARTY MEETINGS IN AND THEY'LL NEED TO BE LOCAL PARTY MEETINGS IN ORDER TO FOR LOCAL PARTIES TO HAVE THEIR VIEW ON HOW THEIR MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE IN THIS IN THIS NOMINATION I DIDN'T HEAR THAT COME OUT THERE YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT HARASSMENT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE POINTED THE FINGER DIRECTLY AT MOMENTUM FOR HAVING A RESPONSIBILITY FOR FOR THAT SORT OF CLIMATE
LET'S BE VERY CLEAR HARASSMENT INTIMIDATION IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG AND DOESN'T HAVE A PLACE IN POLITICS AS JEREMY CORBIN HAS REPEATEDLY SAID AS MOMENTUM REPEATEDLY SAYS WE HAVE RECEIVED NOT A SINGLE CASE WHERE SOMEONE HAD SAID THIS IS A MEMBER OF MOMENTUM AND THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND IF THEY WERE IF THAT EVER DOES HAPPEN WE WILL INVESTIGATE AND IF ANYBODY IS FOUND TO HAVE BREACHED A MEMBER OF THE MOMENTUM STOOD UP AT THE LAUNCH OF THE ANTI CEMETERIES AND REPORT BY SHOVING OFF TO MEMBER MOMENTUM THERE THE PERSON YOU'RE NOT A MARRIED M.P.
NOT A MEMBER OF MOMENTUM AS HE SAID AS HE SAID THE NEXT DAY NOT A MEMBER OF MOMENTUM THOUGH THEY'RE BENT AT OTHER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF YOUR FELLOW ORGANISER STAN KEEBLE HAS WRITTEN ABOUT A CIVIL WAR BEING LAUNCHED BY THE HARD RIGHT SAYING THE LEFT MUST RESPOND WITH THE COMBINATION OF DISCIPLINARY THREATS CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AND RE SELECTION MEASURES I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S NOT INTIMIDATION OR WORSE WENT I DON'T THINK AT ALL
PAINTING THINGS IN TERMS OF A CIVIL WAR IS THAT NOT QUITE INFLAMMATORY I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT QUITE A LOT OF THE HEADLINES ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PARTY PEOPLE ARE WRITING ABOUT INTENSIVE OR IT'S NOT THE TERMS I WOULD THAT'S COMMENTARY THOUGH IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN PEOPLE WITHIN THE PARTY START TO PIT ONE PART OF IT AGAINST ANOTHER USING A TERM LIKE CIVIL WAR
I IT'S NOT A TERM THAT I WOULD USE HER DO YOU NOT THINK HOWEVER THAT YOU CAN SAY THAT'S CAUGHT SAYING THAT THERE'S A CIVIL WAR IS IN SOME WAY IT INTIMIDATION OR HARASSMENT I THINK THE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES SHOULD TRY TO TAKE THE HEAT OUT OF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE HAVE TWO MONTHS NOW TO TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE POLICIES THAT THE LABOUR PARTY SHOULD BE PUTTING FORWARD AND HOW SHALL WE BE ORGANISING THE COUNTRY TO RE ENGAGE WITH VOTERS AND THAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN A CIVIL MANNER ON BOTH SIDES AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT ALL THE LEADERS SHOULD BE CALLING FOR AND INDEED ARE CALLING FOR
JAMES RYDER THANK YOU SO HOW WILL THOSE WHO WANT TO DEPOSE JEREMY CORBIN NOW REACT MARGARET HODGE LABOUR M.P. FOR BARKING BOUGHT THE MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE IN MISTER CORBIN SHE JOINS US FROM OUR RADIO CAR MORNING TO YOU MOTHER
GOOD MORNING NOW STILL LISTENING TO THAT IS JAMES SCHNEIDER OF THE MOMENTUM MOVEMENT BUT IT PEOPLE WILL LISTEN TO IT AND SAY SOUNDS QUITE REASONABLE MAN HE SAYS NOT A SINGLE INCIDENT IS CONNECTED TO MOMENTUM ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO HIM ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK HIS ORGANISATION IS REALLY UP TO
WELL IT'S A STANCE THAT STATEMENT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING FOR JEREMY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AROUND AND JEREMY ARE INDULGING IF THIS IS THE NEW KINDS OF POLITICS IT'S A DIRTY POLITICS THAT I WANT NO PART OF
BRICKS BEING THROWN TO WINDOWS PEOPLE BEING CAUGHT SCUM PEOPLE BEING INSULTED PICKERING BULLIED PEOPLE BEING INTIMIDATED I YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY FIFTY YEARS OF POLITICAL LIFE HAD TO REFER TO REALLY OFFENSIVE EMAILS I RECEIVED ANTI SEMITIC EMAILS TO THE POLICE
THIS IS NOT THE NEW POLITICS IS ACTUALLY THE OLD POLITICS IT'S THE POLITICS I FOUGHT IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN PEOPLE LIKE JOHN MCDONNELL AND KEN LIVINGSTONE AGAIN WERE IN LEADERSHIP ROLES IT WAS A POLITICS OF INTOLERANCE AND BULLYING
INTIMIDATION AND AT THAT TIME ACTUALLY NICK I REMEMBER AN OCCASION WHEN AGAIN I HAD PEOPLE IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBER TEARING UP WOOD FROM THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND HURLING AT ME AND MY GREAT FEELING TODAY IS I'M SEEING TODAY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE SAME THING THAT I SAW IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WELL MYSTICAL WHEN SAYS HE CONDEMNS IT MISTER SCHNEIDER IS HERE FROM MOMENTUM HE'S CAMPAIGN GROUP SAYS THAT THEY CONDEMN IT
THEY SPLIT WITH STOPPING IT THEY'VE THEY'VE GOT A STOP IT IT'S NO GOOD YOU KNOW THESE ARE PEOPLE WORKING IN JEREMY'S NAME THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND JEREMY
FAR TOO MANY INDIVIDUALS MEMBERS ARE PARLANCE A AND AND OTHERS ARE BEING INTIMIDATED BULLIED HARASSED PHYSICALLY BESIDES MY AND THEN COME BACK TO YOU COS HER MOTHER THOUGHT SHE SAYS WHETHER IT'S BEEN DONE IN YOUR NAME OR NOT YOU COULD STOP IT
THE IDEA THAT JEREMY CORBIN OR MOMENTUM ALL THOSE AROUND HIM ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A BRICK TO ANGELA EQUALS WINDOW IS ABOUT LOOKING AT A LIST OF AS IN SHE JUST NOT ONE INCIDENT WITH FINE BUT BUT ALL OF THOSE WHO IS ABOUT AS LOGICAL AS SAYING THAT ANGELA EAGLE'S SAY OR MARGARET HODGE SAY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH THREATS OR JEREMY CORBIN HAS RECEIVED WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WHICH IS A PROBLEM IN SOCIETY ABOUT THE TONE IN WHICH WE TAKE OUR DEBATE AND WE SEE IT MOST IN ITS ONLINE FORM
MY I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH AND IT MARGARET HODGE ROGERS LATER SHE'S GOING TO SAY IT DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE IT DIDN'T HAVE THREE YEARS IT DIDN'T HAPPEN UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF ED MILITANT MELBOURNE THE LAST TIME WE HAD THIS SORT OF ATMOSPHERE IN THE LABOUR PARTY WAS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT
WE'RE FIGHTING IT PROBABLY THE HEART OF IT LIES IN WHAT IS WHAT IS THIS ARGUMENT WHAT IS A BATTLE ALL ABOUT I CAME INTO POLITICS TO CHANGE THE WORLD THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATED ME
AND I WOULD PUT AT MY PROBLEM WITH JEREMY IN THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM IS THAT THEY'RE NOT IN POLITICS TO CHANGE THE WORLD THEY'RE IN POLITICS TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE MACHINERY THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO BE FAIR HE ELECTED IN A DEMOCRATIC ELECTION AND HE WOULD SAY THAT HE WANTS TO CHANGE THE WORLD BUT OF COURSE HE HAS A BUYER IN THE LABOUR PARTY TO DO IT AND IT IS YOU PEOPLE WHO ARE SPLITTING THE LABOUR PARTY YOU PRODUCE IN THE ANGER BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CAN'T ACCEPT YOU LOST
THE HEAT HE CAME IN HE WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY NINE MONTHS AGO THAT PRIVILEGE DOES NOT GIVE HIM THE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE LABOUR PARTY WHEN HE IS FAILING SO BADLY THREE SAW CARTILAGE
WHETHER THE A BRIEF IF I COULD JUST PUT TO MARGARET HODGE WE KNOW OWEN SMITH IS GOING TO DECLARE THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR LABOUR HE NEEDED TODAY DOES IT WORRY YOU THAT THOSE ON YOUR SIDE IF YOU LIKE ARE NOW SPLIT BETWEEN SUPPORTERS OF MISTER SMITH AND SUPPORTERS OF ANGELA EAGLE
WE'VE GOT A HUGE NUMBER OF VERY TALENTED PEOPLE IN THE LABOUR PARTY IF OWEN SMITH COMES FAULTS IF ANYBODY ELSE COMES FORWARD WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS THAT THERE ARE MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED THROUGH PROBABLY THE CHIEF WHIP WHERE WE HAVE HUSTINGS IN THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY AND WE CHOOSE ONE CANDIDATE AS THE UNITY CANDIDATE
TO FIGHT FOR THE HEART THE EXISTENCE AND FOR THE FUTURE OF A DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY THAT CAN PROVIDE A STRONG OPPOSITION AND HAVE HOPE A FEAR OF FORMING A NEW GOVERNMENT MARGARET HODGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHANGE NOT THANK YOU
# THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHAT SORT OF ECONOMIC POLICIES WILL A NEW PRIME MINISTER PURSUE THERESA MAY TALK THE OTHER DAY ABOUT GIVING SHAREHOLDERS OR VOTE ON CHIEF EXECUTIVE PAY THAT WAS AN IDEA PUT FORWARD BY THE COALITION AND DOMINIC'S BEEN SPEAKING TO THE MAN WHO CAME UP WITH THE PLAN DOMINIC AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SPEAKING TO HIM LIVE IN A MINUTE BUT YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT FOR AN INCOMING CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY SAID SOME QUITE SURPRISING THINGS SHE PROMISED HAVE A PROPER INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY TO BE ABLE TO BLOCK TAKEOVERS
SHE WANTS SUPPORT WORKERS ON THE BOARDS OF MAJOR FIRMS AND SHE WANTS TO GIVE SHAREHOLDERS BINDING PAY BUT EVERY YEAR FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES IF YOU THINK YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THOSE IDEAS BEFORE WILL YOU HAVE SIR VINCE CABLE CHAMPIONED INDUSTRIAL TRAGEDY AND BINDING PAY VOTES WHEN HE WAS A COALITIONS BUSINESS SECRETARY AND HE'S NOW SALFORD STUDIOS VINCE WERE YOU SURPRISED TO FIND YOUR OWN IDEAS COMING BACK AT YOU END AND FROM THE INCOMING CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER
NOT TILL CLAY I'M IN TREES AMAZE ALWAYS BEEN VERY SELF CONTAINED AND STUCK TO HER BRIEF SO I THINK PEOPLE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THEIR VIEWS BUT SHE DID MAKE A SPEECH I THINK BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN
WHEN SHE ENDORSE THE WHOLE IDEA OF INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY YOU KNOW WORKING CLOSELY WITH BUSINESS FOR THE LONG TERM AND ONE OF A SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS OF THE COALITION SHE NEVER OF COURSE ATTRIBUTED THIS TO THE LIB DEM PARTNERS IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT WAS IT'S WORKED SUCCESSFULLY I THINK BUSINESSES ANXIOUS TO SEE THAT KIND OF LONG TERM APPROACH COMING BACK AND IF SHE IS IN FAVOUR OF IT THAT'S GREAT I THINK YOU'RE VERY SPECIFIC THING WHICH WAS INTERESTING WAS HER OPPOSITION TO THE TAKEOVER THE FRASER TAKE ZE ANIKA
WHEN I WAS TWO WHEN WE MANAGED TO SEE IT OFF BUT SHE'S ARGUING I THINK FOR NOW OFFER A MUCH MORE FRENCH STYLE AND AWESOME INTERNATIONAL CHAMP IT IS I THINK MY RADICAL DO YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE IT IS QUITE A RADICAL THING TO BE ABLE TO SAY WILL PROTECT INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES FROM BEING TAKEN OVER YOU NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT DOING
WE DID IN THE PARTICULAR CASE OF ASTRAS ANIKA BUT THE CHEESE I THINK WANTED TO GO FURTHER AND IF WE DO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S OF COURSE ONE AREA WHERE NATIONAL POLICY IS MUCH FREER AND IT WOULD BE IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OLD TO BECOME MORE FRIENDLY
THAT THAT THAT COMING TO SOME SENSE IN THAT PARTICULARLY IN INDUSTRIES WHERE THERE'S A BIG SCIENCE BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT TRYING TO PROTECT WHAT ABOUT THIS QUESTION ON BINDING VOTES ON PAY YOU LOOKED AT THIS THE IDEA THAT SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE ABLE TO REJECT A SILLY NUMBER FOR A CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN A PARTICULAR YEAR
THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND YOU DIDN'T WHY NOT WELL WE DID WE DID BRING IN BANDING VOTES FOR FORWARD LOOKING PAY POLICY ON POLICY NOT ON THE NUMBERS AND NOT ON THE RETROSPECTIVE PAY AND I'D CERTAINLY IN WOULD ENCOURAGE HER TO HAVE A FRESH LOOK AT THAT THE REASON WE DIDN'T WAS A TECHNICAL LEGAL PROBLEM THAT YOU'D GET SHAREHOLDERS BOATING DOWN CONTRACTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN SIGNED IN THE GREED
# THAT IN A TOUGHENING UP THE POLICY I WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN FAVOUR OF THAT AND HAVEN'T ENCOURAGER THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE MUCH ON HER MIND AS INWARD INVESTMENT AND AS BUSINESS SECRETARY HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME MAKING SURE BRITAIN'S BIG CAR PLANTS KIT NEW MODELS THIS HAS GOT TO BE A WORRY NOW THERE WERE GRIPPED THE EUROPEAN UNION IF YOU HAVE AS A SECRETARY WOULD YOU BE SPENDING ALL YOUR TIME TALKING TO NESSA
WELL THE OTHER CAR COMPANIES THE AEROSPACE COMPANIES OF COURSE THESE DID WARM DURING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THAT THEIR FUTURE IN THE U.K. WAS AT SOME EXTENT AT RISK THEY WERE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO CLAIM THEY WERE GOING TO WALK AWAY I'M SURE THEY WERE ON THE PROBLEM NOW IS THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY WHEN IT COMES TO
LAUNCHING A NEW MODEL BUILDING A NEW FACTORY IT'S OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL IT'S GOING TO GO AGAINST THE U.K. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE NEW PRIME MINISTER GIVES HER BACKING TO A LONG TERM INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY TO GIVE CONFIDENCE VINCE CAN I ADD A QUESTION HERE YOU CLASHED WITH THERESA MAY WHEN SHE WAS HOME SECRETARY KNEW HER BUSINESS SECTOR ON THIS ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION AGAIN AND AGAIN WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE WAY SHE DID BUSINESS
# WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE BE PREPARED FOR IN HER STYLE OF GOVERNING SHE WAS ALWAYS VERY COURTEOUS AND A BIT FROSTY BUT THE MEN THAT'S THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT I DIDN'T KILL ANY PERSONAL ANTAGONISM TOWARDS HER BECAUSE SHE WAS DOING HER JOB AND I WAS DOING MY JOB AND MY CONCERN WAS THAT WHEN IT CAME ROUND TO DRASTICALLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF OVERSEAS STUDENTS
SO CALLED TEAR TWO VISAS FOR HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE SHE WAS ACTUALLY DOING ECONOMIC HARM IT WASN'T JUST MY VIEW CERTAINLY OR GEORGE OSBORNE TOOK EXACTLY THE SAME FOR YOU THAT SHE WAS VERY VERY DETERMINED TO IMPLEMENT THE POLICY WHICH SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN A SORT OF DISREGARDED THE WIDER ECONOMIC CONTEXT I JUST HOPE THAT IT WAS A CASE OF HER DOING HER JOB AND NOW THAT SHE'S IN THE TOP JOB SHE'LL TAKE A WIDER PERSPECTIVE WE SHALL SEE WE'LL KNOW VERY SOON VINCE CABLE VINCE CABLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT DOMINATED THE CONDOM AS WELL
# THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN MILITARY HOUSING HAS GOT SO BAD THAT SOME SOLDIERS ARE LIVING IN BUILDINGS WITH SEWAGE LEAKING OUT OF THE PIPES THAT'S ONE OF THE FINDINGS OF A REPORT RELEASED TODAY BY M.P.S ON THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE WHO SAY ACCOMMODATION HAS GOT SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LETTING DOWN SERVICE PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE REPORTER SEE MACA TOUCHES HERE
AND WITH MORE ON THIS WHAT SORTS OF CONDITIONS WERE DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT SOONER WELL JUST GIVE YOU A BIT OF BACKGROUND MICHELLE ALL SERVICE PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE OFFERED SUBSIDISED HOUSING IT'S PART AND PARCEL OF BEING IN THE MILITARY BUT TODAY'S REPORT ACCUSES THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE OF LETTING DOWN ITS SOLDIERS BY SOMETIMES PROVIDING THEM
WITH POOR QUALITY HOUSING OFTEN WITHOUT BASIC FACILITIES SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE HEAT HOT WATER A WORKING BOILER SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS I'VE HEARD YOU JUST MENTIONED IN YOUR INTRO THERE I'VE SPOKEN TO A SOLDIER WHO SAID THAT HIS PIPE IS LEAKING AND THERE'S SEWAGE SEEPING OUT OF IT SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE CONDITIONS ARE ALSO REFERRED TO IN THIS VERY DAMNING REPORT TODAY AND IT'S GOT WORSE OVER THE LAST YEAR WHY WOULD THAT BE
WELL THE M.O.D. SAYS THAT IT OUT SOURCES ITS HOUSING TO A COMPANY CALLED CAREER ALIEN AMY AND THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF FINDING PROPERTIES ARE MAKING SURE THEY'RE UP TO SCRATCH THIS COMPANY CAME INTO PLAY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND THE ACCUSATION IS THAT THIS COMPANY WAS NOT VERY WELL PREPARED IN TACKLING THE NEEDS OF MILITARY PERSONNEL THEY DO SAY THAT THEY HAVE PUT CHANGES INTO PLACE NOW AND THINGS ARE WORKING A LOT BETTER BUT I THINK
WHAT IS KEY HERE MICHELLE IS THAT HOUSING IS AN ISSUE THAT COMES UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN YOU SPEAK TO MILITARY PERSONNEL AND THIS REPORT NOW PUTS FURTHER PRESSURE ON MINISTERS TO MAKE DRASTIC CHANGES THE COMMITTEE ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF FAILING TO KEEP ITS PROMISE SET OUT IN THE MILITARY COVENANT NOW YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THAT'S THE PLEDGE THAT WAS ENSHRINED IN LAW BY DAVID CAMERON IN TWENTY ELEVEN THAT
PERSONNEL WILL BE LOOKED AFTER AND PROVIDED WITH GOOD ACCOMMODATION THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE SAYS THAT SWIFT ACTION AS I SAID HAS BEEN TAKEN AND THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TO THE M.P.S RECOGNISE THAT THEY SAY YES BUT THEY'RE SAYING THEY WANT FURTHER PROOF FROM THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE THE CASE SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THEY'RE GOING TO BE BADGERING AWAY I'M KEEPING A VERY CLOSE EYE ON HIM HE COULD TOUCH HER THANK YOU

I SPENT LAST NIGHT IN WESTMINSTER WHERE PREPARATIONS WERE BEING MADE FOR THE TRANSFER OF POWER
OPPOSITE THE MOST FAMOUS BLACK DOOR IN THE WORLD HERE ON DOWNING STREET IS A FOREST OF STEP LADDERS WHITE TAPE TO MARKING OUT THE POSITION FOR THE SNAPPERS THE PHOTOGRAPHERS THE T.V. CAMERAMAN TO GET THEIR PICTURES
OF A UNIQUELY BRITISH MOMENT THE MOMENT WHEN POWER TRANSFERS FROM ONE PRIME MINISTER TO THE NEXT FROM DAVID CAMERON TO THERESA MAY
PARKED ON THE SIDE STREET OVERNIGHT THE PRIME MINISTERIAL LIMO COVERED UP POLISH NO DOUBT FOR THAT FINAL JOURNEY TO SEE HER MAJESTY AT THE PALACE
WHO KNOWS WHAT ADVICE THE OUTGOING PRIME MINISTER WILL GIVE HIS SUCCESSOR HE MAY SAY THIS THOUGH
THAT THE CAREFULLY CRAFTED SOUND BITES THE PROMISES THE GOOD INTENSE ARE ALL NOTHING COMPARED WITH A SINGLE JUDGEMENT OR A SINGLE MISJUDGEMENT ASKED TONY BLAIR ABOUT ORAC ASKED DAVID CAMERON ABOUT THE E.U. REFERENCE
MOMENTOUS DAYS LIKE THESE THIS LITTLE PATCH OF GRASS OPPOSITE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS COLLEGE GREEN
BECOMES AN ENCAMPMENT COMPLETE WITH THE TENTS IN THE GAZEBOS OF THE T.V. NEWS GUYS MILLING AROUND THEM
POLITICIANS OF ALL COLOURS AND HUES EAGER TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY KNOW
AND OF COURSE TO HIDE WHAT THEY DON'T ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT BRING
ONE QUESTION HANGS OVER THIS PLACE HOW MUCH CHANGE HOW MUCH CONTINUITY WILL THERE BE BETWEEN THE CAMERON AND THE MAY ERAS
AND THE DIRTY SECRET WHICH FEW WILL BE WILLING TO ADMIT IS THAT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERESA MAY HAS BEEN AT THE TOP A BRITISH GOVERNMENT FOR MANY MANY YEARS SHE'S BEEN REMARKABLY SECRETIVE ABOUT WHAT SHE REALLY
CAN WALK ON SECRETARIES DIVED
NOW IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS
THAT'S HIS WIFE EVER IS IN POLITICS AS WE ALL KNOW NEVER TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED AND YOU SAT AT THE CABINET TABLE WHAT YOU SAW THE OLD DEPARTING PRIME AS YOU SAW THAT KNEW WHAT WHAT WAS IN YOUR MOUTH
WHAT WAS IN MY MIND WAS THAT WHEN DAVID CAMERON BECAME LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND HE WAS THERE WITH THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY AND I BELIEVE THAT HE'S MADE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
FAR FAR MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION AS A WHOLE AND THAT IS A TREMENDOUS TRIBUTE TO HIM DESPITE ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT HE'S DONE HIS PREMIERSHIP AS WELL
DO WE KNOW YET HOW MUCH CHANGE HOW MUCH CONTINUITY THEY'LL BE BETWEEN THE MAY ADMINISTRATION AND THE CAMERON WERE ALL WAITING TO SEE
I'M GOING TO LURE US FORM A COALITION MINISTER I THINK IT IS A VERY BIG THING WHEN YOU GO INTO OFFICE FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT'S REALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT HER CHALLENGE NOW IS I THINK IF YOU'RE TAKING OVER AS LEADER OF A PARTY THAT'S ALREADY IN
WITH COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE ALREADY GOT STRONG VIEWS ABOUT PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE
ACTUALLY YOU DON'T HAVE THAT BLANK PIECE OF PAPER WHICH CAN BE QUITE A BIG ASSET WHEN YOU'RE TAKING OVER FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE TO RECALIBRATE FROM WITHIN GOVERNMENT THAT ARGUABLY AS A TOUGHER
I'M MICHAEL LOIS I'M THE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR NORTHAMPTON NORTH AND I'M THE PARLIAMENTARY PRIVATE SECRETARY TO THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY SOON TO BE PRIME MINISTER
WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT TERESA IS THAT SHE'S UNFLAPPABLE EVERYTHING IS FRANKLY CALM
OTHERS MAY BE SHALL WE SAY EXCITED BY THE SITUATION OTHERS MAY BE RUSHING ABOUT
THERESA MAY IS SOMEONE WHO CAN BE RELIED UPON FOR STEADINESS
FOR PROFESSIONALISM AND FRANKLY HAS ALREADY DISPLAYED THAT IN HER PUBLIC SERVICE SO FAR SHE'S LASTED MICK IN THE HOME
FOR OVER SIX YEARS IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY RECORD IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE SO FAR SHE'D BEEN WAITING FOR THIS JOB FOR QUITE A WHILE AS A CHEF
I THINK THAT SHE'S BEEN WORKING IN THE HOME OFFICE NICK EXTREMELY HARD AND THAT'S WITHIN THE POSSIBILITY
AROUND THE CORNER FROM COLLEGE GREEN DOWN A QUIET STREET THROUGH AN ARCHWAY
BUSINESS CARRIES ON AS USUAL INSIDE THE WESTMINSTER BUBBLE WHICH AT THIS TIME IN THE AIR MEANS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE AND A CANAPE BECAUSE THE BRITISH BANKERS ASSOCIATION ARE HAVING THEIR SUMMER PARTY
LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING HER SPEECH FROM PHILIP HAMMOND FOREIGN SECRETARY OR MAYBE SUE CHANCER OF THE EXCHANGE
THANK YOU WE'VE CERTAINLY BEEN LIVING IN INTERESTING TIMES OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF WEEKS I CERTAINLY CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE IT
WHAT I WANT TO SEE NOW AND I HOPE I'LL BE A PART OF IT BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE IT IS A GOVERNMENT IN PLACE
THAT HAS A CLEAR POSITION NOT ONLY ON OUR APPROACH TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH EUROPE BUT ON THE OTHER BIG CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING US AS
THE MARKETS MAY HAVE CALMED A LITTLE THE BANKERS MAY BE RELIEVED THE TORY PARTY MAY BE PATTING ITSELF ON THE BACK THAT IT'S FOUND SOME WAY THROUGH THIS CRISIS BUT WHEN M.P.S TROOP THROUGH HERE THE CENTRAL LOBBY OF THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT TO HEAR DAVID CAMERON TAKE PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS
FOR THE VERY LAST TIME THE FUNDAMENTALS WILL NOT HAVE CHANGED THREE YEARS AGO WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS EUROPEAN REFERENDUM I ASKED MISTER CAMERON
WHETHER HE HAD A PLAN B. JUST IN CASE HE LOST THE ANSWER HE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE WAS NO
THERESA MAY NOW HAS TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES IT IS SHE WHO WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BIGGEST FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGE THAT ANY GOVERNMENT HAS FACED IN DECADES IT IS SHE WHO MAY FIND THAT SHE HAS TO MAKE YET MORE AUSTERITY CUTS IT IS SHE WHO WILL HAVE TO DO IT WITH A TIDY PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY
SHE MAY COME TO REALISED THAT TODAY HER FIRST DAY AS PRIME MINISTER WAS BY FAR HER EASIEST
IT'S NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND ME'S WOMEN OF POWER IS THE HEADLINE FOR THE DAILY MIRROR WHICH SAYS AMBER ARE JUSTINE GREENING AND ANNA SUPERIOR ALL TIPPED FOR SENIOR ROLES WHILE WHAT IT CALLS BRICKS IT BACKING TORIES ANDREA LEAD SOME ENTRIES ARE VILLAS ARE LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED THE TIME SAYS MISSUS MAY'S EXPECTED TO HAND THIS IS ROD ONE OF THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IN CABINET WITH THE TREASURY DEEMED MOST LIKELY
FOR THE SUN MISSUS MAY'S USHERING IN A GIRL POWER REVOLUTION AT NUMBER TEN IT ALSO QUOTES FRIENDS OF GEORGE OSBORNE ARE SAYING HE'LL WALK AWAY FROM GOVERNMENT UNLESS HE'S MADE FOREIGN SECRETARY OR TRADE SECRETARY
TAKE YOUR PICK YOU AS YOU LOOK AT THE PAPERS IT'S WHO GETS WHICH JOB THE GUARDIAN CLAIMED THE CHRIS GRAYLING HAS BEEN NAMED AS A FROM RUTHERFORD CHANCELLOR AND MISSUS MAY WILL APPOINT OTHER SENIOR BRICKS IT CAMPAIGNERS IN THE PAPER SAYS SUCH AS BORIS JOHNSON AND PRETTY PATEL IT'S PART OF EFFORTS TO UNIFY THE PARTY THE DAILY MAIL SAYS THAT ONE OF HER FIRST APPOINTMENT WITH A CABINET MINISTER IN CHARGE OF AS IT PUTS IT TAKING US OUT OF THE E.U. WITH LIAM FOX
OH YES AND ALSO CHRIS GRAYLING SAID TO BE THE FAVOURITES MAY WILL STOP MIGRANT CRISIS DECLARES THE FRONT OF THE DAILY EXPRESS WHICH SAYS IT'S LEARNED THERESA MAY WILL MAKE STRICT NEW LIMITS ON IMMIGRATION HAD TOPPED DEMAND FOR AN E. YOU EXIT DEAL SOMETHING ITS EDITORIAL DESCRIBES THIS REASSURING NEWS THE FINANCIAL TIMES MEANWHILE REPORTS WHAT IT CALLS A SURGEON BRITAIN'S APPLYING TO BECOME CITIZENS OF OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES TO PRESERVE THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE AND WORK ON THE CONTINENT THE TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH THE DEPARTURE OF DAVID CAMERON WHO'S INTERVIEW WITH THE PAPER PROVIDES ITS HEADLINE
AS I LEAVE TODAY I HOPE PEOPLE WILL SEE A STRONGER COUNTRY THE PAPERS EDITORIAL PRAISES MY CAMERA'S ACHIEVEMENTS AND SAYS IT HOPES HE REMAINS IN THE COMMONS WHERE WE CAN OFFER MUCH WISE ADVICE TO THERESA MAY BUT THE GUARDIAN BELIEVED HE MORE FROM A POLITICIAN OF PROMISE WHO OFFERED A NEW VERSION OF CONSERVATISM INTO HER PRIME MINISTER HER BROKEN PROMISES CAMERON SLIDES INTO POLITICAL AFTERLIFE IS THE HEADLINE FOR THE F. T. WHICH SAYS HE LEAVES OFFICE WITH HIS DOMESTIC POLICY AGENDA
# LARGELY UNFINISHED ON CIVIL WAR COULD SPLIT LABOUR FOREVER IS THE LEAD HEADLINE FOR THE DAILY MIRROR WHICH SAYS REBEL M.P.S COULD LEAVE IF JEREMY CORBIN WINS THE LEADERSHIP BATTLE FOR THE PAPER'S POLITICAL EDITOR JASON BEATTIE IT'S AGONISING TO WATCH THE SLOW PAINFUL DEMISE OF LABOUR THE POISON IN LABOUR'S VEINS IS NOW SO DEEP HE SAYS NOBODY CAN SEE A WAY OF ENDING THIS HARMONIOUSLY FOR THE TELEGRAPH THE DECISION TO GUARANTEE MY PLACE ON THE BALLET WAS A MAJOR BLOW FOR EM PEAS HOPING TO REMOVE HIM
# THEY RECEIVED A BOOST WHEN RULES THAT ALLOWED ANYONE TO VOTE IN LAST SUMMER'S CONTEST BY PAYING JUST THREE POUNDS WE DITCHED BUT AMIDST ALL THE POLITICAL CHANGE ONE PROMINENT FIGURE HE'S DEFINITELY KEEPING HIS JOB THE CHIEF MOUSER TO THE CABINET OFFICE THE DAILY EXPRESS'S AMONGST THOSE TO REPORT THAT LARRY THE DOWNING STREET CAT WILL REMAIN AT NUMBER TEN
AS HE'S A CIVIL SERVICE CAT HAPPY AS LARRY IS THE HEADLINE FOR THE EYE FOR THE TIMES WILL BE A REASSURING CONSTANT IN CHANGING TIMES AND THE MALES CARTOONIST PUGH PICTURES TO DOGS WATCHING ANNOUNCEMENT ON T. V. LARRY THE CAT TO STAY AT NUMBER TEN IT SAYS AND THEIR REMARK IN ONE TO THE OTHER CRONYISM AT ITS WORST THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
# NOW IF YOU KNOW ONLY TWO THINGS ABOUT VINCENT VAN GOGH THEY'LL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE THAT HE PAINTED THOSE SUNFLOWERS AND HE CUT OFF PART OF HIS EAR TO GIVE TO A PROSTITUTE
BUT STOP THERE YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THE SUNFLOWERS OF COURSE BUT NEW RESEARCH UNVEILED IN AMSTERDAM YESTERDAY SUGGESTS THAT VAN GOGH CUT OFF ALMOST ALL OF THAT AND GAVE IT TO SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN A BROTHEL BUT WAS NOT A PROSTITUTE BERNADETTE MURPHY IS IN AMSTERDAM SHE IS THE AUTHOR OF VAN GOGH THE TRUE STORY GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING TO YOU HOW DID YOU BEGIN TOUGH PIECE THIS STORY TOGETHER AT THIS ALTERNATIVE VERSION OF EVENTS
RATHER STRANGELY I FOUND A DOCUMENT IN AMSTERDAM IN THE ARCHIVES DATED NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE IT WAS JUST A SORT OF SMALL LINE IN THE LETTER WHICH TOOK ME ON A JOURNEY TO UNITED STATES WHERE HIDING IN ARCHIVE IN THE BANCROFT LIBRARY IT WAS A DRAWING TO MAKE A DOCTOR WHO TREATED FINGER
AND THAT DRAWING APPEARED TO SHOW THAT HE CHOPPED OFF A LOT MORE RESERVED THAN WE EVER KNEW YES HE TOOK TO
PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE YEAR AND EVEN IF THE PUBLIC HAS ALWAYS KNOWN SORT OF AT LEAST ASSUMED THAT HE HAD CUT OFF HIS EAR NOW THE STORY THEN WAS THAT HE'D TAKEN THIS ONLY GIVEN IT TO A PROSTITUTE IN A BROTHEL WHEN AGAIN YOU FOUND A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VERSION OF EVENTS THAT TOOK A LOT MORE PIECING TOGETHER THERE'S LOTS OF SMALL DETAILS LOCAL DETAILS I LIVE IN FRANCE AND SO LITERALLY LIVE LOCALLY YOU PICK UP BITS AND PIECES ALL OVER THE PLACE AND EVENTUALLY I TRACE THE FAMILY AND SPOKE TO THE FAMILY
ONE THEY EVENTUALLY CONFIRMED THEY WEREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT SOME VERY EVENTUALLY THEY CONFIRMED COULD INDEED HAVE HER SHE WAS A CLEANER IN THE BROTH THOUGHT THEY WERE VERY UPSET THAT FROM BUT SHE'D SUFFERED ALL HER LIFE AND PEOPLE WERE IMAGINING THAT SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE
THE DETAILS ARE A FASCINATING IN THEMSELVES BUT YOU'RE ALSO TELLING US SOMETHING RATHER DIFFERENT ABOUT VAN GOGH IN OTHER WORDS THE ASSUMPTION THAT BOOZE ALCOHOL WAS OFTEN A CAUSE OF THIS BUT YOU THINK IT WAS NOT HE WAS MENTALLY ILL
WELL I SLIGHTLY DISAGREE WITH THE VAN GOGH MUSEUM ON THIS BECAUSE I CAN FIND NO EVIDENCE OF VINCENT AROUND DRINKING OUT SOUND FOR THE FAMOUS DRINK THAT WHICH DROVE HIM CRAZY I CAN'T FIND IT BEING SOLD PARTICULARLY IN AT THE TIME WAS VERY COMMON IN PARIS BUT IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY PROMINENT
SO I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE OVER EXAGGERATED THE IDEA OF ALCOHOL BEING THE COURSE AND WHEN YOU SEE THE DRAWING IT ALL COMES TO LIFE THAT THE MAN CREATING WHAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS
AND THERE'S A FASCINATING REASON YOU'VE COME UP WITH FOR WHY HE MIGHT HAVE CUT OFF HIS EAR AND GIVEN IT TO THE GIRL THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED
YES I THINK IT'S THE ONLY PART OF THE BOOK WHICH UNITS INVEST COULD BOOK AND IT'S THE ONLY PART OF THE BOOK WHERE I MAKE MY OWN SUGGESTION ON SOMETHING I REALLY WANT TO AVOID ENDLESS THEORIES ABOUT THINGS BUT I THINK I BELIEVE I KNOW NOW WHY HE CUT IT HE CUT OFF HIS IN WHY GIVE IT TO THAT PARTICULAR GIRL BECAUSE UM
THE GIRL HAD HAD A VERY UNUSUAL ACCIDENT AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND I HAVE NOW GOT FIVE PRESS ARTICLES WHERE'S PEPYS WE HAD A COUPLE OF THEM WHICH I DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HE GIVES A ALMOST CASE I RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY HAS HE GIVES HER THE PRESENT OF HIS FLESH AND HIS FLESH FOR HER FLASH YES FOR HER FLESH
BUT NO IT'S VERY IF YOU KNOW HER STORY IT'S IT'S ALMOST THE MOST STRANGE STORY SHE BEGAN HERE HERE AND WAS TREATED BY PASTA THE PASTA INSTITUTE BECAUSE SHE'D BEEN ATTACKED BY A DOG AND SHE HAD A VERY BAD SCAR ON HER ARM ON HER LEFT ARM AND VINCENT TOOK HER HE'S LEFT HERE AS SOME SORT OF COMPENSATION FORGIVE ME WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE BUT MUCH MORE DETAIL IN YOUR BOOK VAN GOUGH'S THE TRUE STORY BERNADETTE MURPHY THANK YOU
# IT'S NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY OF THE SPEAKER WITH US THIS MORNING IS LORD SINGH DIRECTOR OF THE NETWORK OF SIKH ORGANISATIONS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MICHELLE THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY POET JOHN DRYDEN REFLECTING ON DEMOCRACY WROTE NOREEN'S THE PEOPLE'S JUDGEMENT ALWAYS TRUE THE MOST ME AS GROSSLY S. THERE PHEW
MANY ON THE REMAIN SIDE OF THE REFERENDUM MAY FEEL THAT THIS SPEAKS FOR THEM WELL ON BOTH SIDES AGREED THAT THE DEMOCRATIC DECISION MUST BE RESPECTED NO MATTER HOW CLOSE THE RESULT
THE INCOMING PRIME MINISTERS THERESA MAY HAS ALREADY PLEDGED TO RESPECT THIS DECISION TO LEAVE AND SHE BEGINS THE TASK OF STEERING THE COUNTRY THROUGH UNCERTAIN TIMES
AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS WE'RE NOW FORCED TO LOOK AFRESH AND BASIC QUESTIONS OF IDENTITY SOVEREIGNTY AND ASPIRATIONS IN OUR RELATIONS WITH EUROPE AND WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD
IT'S A SAD ASPECT OF HUMAN NATURE THAT SOMETIMES THE EASIEST WAY IN GETTING SOMEONE ON OUR SIDE IN DISCUSSION OR DEBATE IS TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE WE CAN BLAME FOR ALL OUR PROBLEMS IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES IT WAS PEOPLE FROM THE COMMONWEALTH IN RECENT DEBATE WE HAVE HEARD UNHELPFUL NASTY LANGUAGE ABOUT IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES WHICH IS LED TO A RISE IN HATE CRIMES
IT ALL REMINDS ME OF WHAT I CALL INDERJIT LAW THAT WHEN TWO OR MORE PEOPLE CAN FIND SUFFICIENT IN COMMON TO CALL THEMSELVES US THEY'LL IMMEDIATELY LOOK FOR IN THEM TO DESPISE TO STRENGTHEN THEIR NEW FOUND UNITY
WE SEE IT IN RIVALRY BETWEEN FOOTBALL FANS BUT IN ITS EXTREME FORM WHICH CAN LEAD TO HORRORS LIKE THE HOLOCAUST AND MORE RECENT GENOCIDES
IN THE END OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY GURA NANA WITNESSED UNNECESSARY DIVISIONS IN THE RELIGIONS AROUND HIM AND STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNISING COMMON BELIEFS AND ASPIRATIONS WERE URGE IN THE FIFTH GURU TOOK THIS EMPHASIS ON COMMONALITIES FURTHER BY INCORPORATING SOME OF THE NURSES OF HINDU AND MUSLIM SAINTS IN OUR SCRIPTURES THE GURU GRANTS
TO EMPHASISE COMMON ETHICAL TEACHINGS WHILE THE NINTH GURU GONNA TAKE THE HARD BIT GAVE HIS LIFE DEFENDING THE RIGHT OF ALL PEOPLE TO FREEDOM OF BLEAK
MY HOPE IS THAT LATER TODAY WHEN TERESA ME ASSUMES OFFICE AS PRIME MINISTER SHE WILL SIMILARLY USE HER CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE TO FOCUS ON COMMONALITIES LIKE THE PURSUIT ASSERTION JUSTICE AND RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS AND BELIEFS OF OTHERS AS SHE LEAVES THE COUNTRY TO A NEW FUTURE THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH LORD SINGH DIRECTOR OF THE NETWORK OF SIKH ORGANISATIONS
# IT'S ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IF YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM CHEST PAIN A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL WILL ASK THEMSELVES COULD IT BE A HEART ATTACK AND IN THE SAME WAY PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM A SERIOUS INFECTION WILL NOW PROMPT THE QUESTION COULD IT BE SEPSIS SEPTICAEMIA OR BLOOD POISONING CAUSES MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND AVOIDABLE DEATHS EVERY YEAR A NEW GUIDANCE FROM NICE THE HEALTH WATCHDOG FOR ENGLAND WILL NOW URGED DOCTORS AND NURSES TO CONSIDER IT AS A POSSIBILITY EARLY ON
IN DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN MELISSA NEEDS ONE YEAR OLD SON WILLIAM BECAME VERY ILL WITH WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE SEPSIS AND DIED SHE'S IN A TRUE STUDIO GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING WE SPOKE TO YOU IN JANUARY ABOUT HOW THE ONE ONE ONE SERVICE HANDLED WILLIAMS' CASE IS THIS GUIDANCE TODAY WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR
ABSOLUTELY OF COURSE IF THIS GUIDANCE HAD BEEN THERE WHEN WE HAD VISITED THE DOCTORS AND OF COURSE THE OUT OF HOURS DOCTORS WE MIGHT NOT BE IN THIS POSITION TODAY YOU KNOW WE CAN ONLY WELCOME
AND THEN THE NICE GUIDELINES AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THEM TO TREAT SEPSIS IN SUCH AS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY WHICH OF COURSE IT IS HOW MANY TIMES DID WILLIAM SEE A DOCTOR A G.P. BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL ELEVEN
ELEVEN TIMES OVER A PERIOD OF WEE THAT WAS OVER A PERIOD OF WEEKS BUT IN THIRTY SIX HOURS BEFORE HE DIED THREE TIMES AND NO ONE MENTIONED SEPSIS NO NOT AT ALL
AND DO YOU DO YOU THINK THEY JUST HADN'T THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT THAT COULD BE A POSSIBILITY EVEN THOUGH HE'D BEEN ILL FOR SO MANY WEEKS I DON'T THINK THEY HAD NO IDEA I JUST THINK THEY WEREN'T THINKING SEPSIS AND I THINK WE'RE IN A POSITION NOW WHERE IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT A PERSON IS BEING
IS IS PRESENTING AS POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS THEN SEPSIS NEEDS TO BE DISCOUNTED IMMEDIATELY NOT LAST BECAUSE AS WE KNOW AND SEPSIS IS A VERY PROGRESSIVELY QUICK CONDITION WHAT WERE HIS SYMPTOMS
WILLIAM WAS HE HAD INITIALLY HE HAD A VERY HIGH FEVER OVER FORTY WHICH THEN DROPPED TO THIRTY FIVE WE WE HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN TOLD BY THE DOCTOR THAT AT A TEMPERATURE DROP WAS WAS A GOOD THING SO WE WE DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT BUT ACTUALLY THAT'S A SIGN OF POOR CIRCULATION AND WILLIAM SKIN WAS VERY PALE HE HE WAS CLAMMY HE WAS VOMITING EM HE'S HE DIDN'T HAVE VERY WET NAPPIES
SO THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY THE SIGNS THAT AS WHEN WE AS A PARENT LOOKED AT HIM COLLECTIVELY WE DIDN'T THINK ALL OF THOSE TOGETHER A SEPSIS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SEPSIS WAS AND LATER ON WHEN YOU REALISED WHAT IT WAS AND INTO TO THINK THAT HIS DEATH WAS AVOIDABLE
THAT MUST BE HEARTBREAKING I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING THAT CAN PREPARE YOU TO LOSE YOUR CHILD BUT TO THEN BE TOLD THAT HE SHOULD HAVE AND COULD HAVE SURVIVED WITH THE RIGHT TREATMENT IS HE'S JUST HIS IS JUST INCOMPREHENSIBLE
LISTENING TO THIS IS PROFESSORS SORT OF FILES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON IS CHAIR OF THE NICE GROUP TO DEVELOPS THE NEW GUIDELINES HE'S WITH US FROM BOURNEMOUTH GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR GOOD MORNING WHY DO YOU THINK WE'RE IN THIS CASE G.P.S ARE PERHAPS OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ANTS HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN SO UNAWARE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF SEPSIS I THINK I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
WITH WHO IF YOU LOOK BACK TO ALWAYS BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT SOME PEOPLE COULD HAVE COULD HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED OR NOT I THINK INDIVIDUAL CASES ARE INTO INDIVIDUAL CASES BUT WHAT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR
BOTH FROM MISSUS MATES SON'S CASE AND FROM MANY OF THE CASES ARE INVESTIGATED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY AND HEALTH SERVICE OMBUDSMAN
IS THAT THAT MANY DOCTORS JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT SEPSIS JUST AS MISSUS MEETS EXPLAINED AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IS GET PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT IT AND TRIGGER THOSE THOUGHT PROCESS ISN'T A PEN IN THEIR BRAINS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS THAT THE FACT IS THAT MOST PEOPLE WITH INFECTION DON'T HAVE SEPSIS AND NEVER WILL DEVELOP SEPSIS
AND WE ALSO MUSTN'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE BEING GIVEN BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS WILLY NILLY AND CAUSE HER MORE OF AN ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE PROBLEM WELL BUT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TRIED TO DO WHAT'S NEEDED
IS A STRUCTURED APPROACH WHEREBY CLINICIANS CAN CAN UNDERSTAND THE RISK FACTORS AND EXPLICIT NON SPECIFIC SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF SEPSIS SO THAT
IF THEY'RE THERE THEN TREATMENT CAN BE ESCALATED AND SO RUN US THROUGH WHAT THEY ARE BECAUSE OF MELISSA METERS MENTION WILLIAMS' SYMPTOMS BUT IF IN SIMPLE TERMS GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT WHAT ARE THE WARNING SIGNS SO THAT SO THAT'S WHAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICALLY DIFFICULT FOR BOTH PARENTS AND CLINICIANS IS THAT SEPSIS IS WERE VERY NON SPECIFIC NON LOCALISED CONSTELLATION OF SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS PATIENTS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE TEMPERATURE
THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEHAVIOURAL CONCERNS ONE OF THE KEY THINGS IS IS FOR DOCTORS AND NURSES TO LISTEN TO THE FAMILIES WHETHER IT'S PARENTS OF A CHILD OR SPRUCES AND OR OR DAUGHTERS SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF OLD PEOPLE
ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT OFTEN SEEMS TO HAPPEN IS HIS HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DON'T ALWAYS LISTEN TO TO FAMILY CONCERNS THERE ARE OTHER RISK FACTORS SUCH AS BEING UNDER ONE BEING ELDERLY HAVING HAD SURGERY AND IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS HOPING RECENTLY PREGNANT
BUT THOSE THINGS ARE JUST TRIGGERS TO TO MAKE YOU THINK IS THIS PERSON IN FRONT TO ME REALLY ILL AND THEN THERE'S A THERE'S A STRUCTURED APPROACH TO LOOKING AT THAT ILL PERSON IT LET'S ATTACK LET'S LOOK AT THEIR HEART RATE THEIR RESPIRATORY RATE AND ANOTHER THING AND HIP AND ME THERE THE THING IS OVER CASES LIKE WILLIAMSON ON I'M NOT THAT FEW AND FAR BETWEEN IN THE SENSE WE HAD TEN THOUSAND AVOIDABLE DEATHS FROM SEPSIS IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY YEAR THAT'S TRUE BUT
BUT THESE OCCUR ACROSS THE HEALTH SPECTRUM SO PEOPLE WILL PRESENT IN GENERAL PRACTICES PEOPLE ARE IN HOSPITAL THEY'RE ON HOSPITAL WARDS THEY GO TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
FOR INDIVIDUAL CLINICIANS THESE UP THESE ARE REALLY RARE OFFENCE TO MOST PEOPLE A PUTT PUTT FROM EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS MOST CLINICIANS AND NURSES WON'T SEE SEPSIS VERY OFTEN IN THEIR CAREERS SO SO IT REALLY IS
CHANGING A CULTURE TOOK TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT AND CONSIDER THE DIAGNOSIS AND WORK THROUGH WHETHER IT COULD BE AND IF IF THEY'RE REALLY SET GET ON AND GET THEM TO HOSPITAL AND GET THE TREATMENT IN EARLY AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT SO SICK THEN THERE'S ARE A WAY OF ASSESSING THEM AND MAKING SURE PARTICULARLY MAKING SURE SENIOR ENOUGH DOCTORS ARE PRESENT TO BE ABLE TO
DECIDE WHETHER SOMEBODY'S GOT SEPSIS AND TO TO ACTUALLY BE EXPERIENCED ENOUGH TO SAY YES I NEED TO TREAT THIS PERSON QUICKLY OR NO I CAN WAIT MELISSA MADE IT'S CLEARLY FROM WHAT THE PROFESSOR IS SAYING I MEAN THESE DEED THERE ARE AVOIDABLE DEATHS BUT IT'S ALSO COMPLEX TO DIAGNOSE SEPSIS HOW REASSURED ARE YOU WITH THIS NEW GUIDANCE
I'M I'M VERY REASSURED WE WE NOW HAVE THE CLINICAL PATHWAYS AND TALK IT'S AVAILABLE FOR G.P.S AND CLINICIANS TO ALL BE THINKING THE SAME WAY AND DEALING WITH AND TRIAGING AS THE PROFESSOR JUST SAID IN IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE WHERE'S MOST CASES WITH WITH A PERSON WITH INFECTION THEY THEY WON'T HAVE SEPSIS BUT EQUALLY WE CAN'T DISCOUNT IT AND SO
I'M THANKFUL THAT FINALLY SEPSIS IS GOING TO BE TREATED AS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY LIKE A PATIENT PRESENTING WITH CHEST PAIN AND A POTENTIAL HEART ATTACK BECAUSE OF COURSE WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING FORTY FOUR THOUSAND DEATHS A YEAR
IF THAT WASN'T THE CASE BUT UNLIKE SOMETHING LIKE MENINGITIS WAY OVER THE YEARS PARENTS HAVE BECOME VERY AWARE OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR THIS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AREA YEAH IT IS INNIT AND SEPSIS DOES IT MIMICS OTHER CONDITIONS LIKE A SEVERE CASE OF FLU AND OBVIOUSLY HIS PROFESSOR SAID AND DOCTOR ON DANIEL TO SAID YOU KNOW IT CAN IT CAN FORM FROM ANY KIND OF INFECTION A CHEST INFECTION WHICH OBVIOUSLY WILLIAM HAD PNEUMONIA A WATER INFECTION POSTOPERATIVE BUT IT'S ABOUT
THE PUBLIC AND ALSO CLINICIANS THINKING SEPSIS AND IF WE HAVE THAT JOINED UP WRITING AND THEY'RE THINKING SEPSIS AND WE ASK COULD THIS BE SEPSIS THEN ACTUALLY WE'RE IN A MUCH MORE ADVANCED ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION TO BE ABLE TO TRIAGE IT MORE APPROPRIATELY AND THOUGHT FOR ONWARD CARE MELISSA MADE THANK YOU AND THANK YOU ALSO TO PROFESSOR SAUL FAST THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT PHIL AVERY'S BACK WITH THE

IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTION TODAY TO RUN FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY THE FORMER SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY OWEN SMITH WILL JOIN ANGELA EAGLE IN CHALLENGING JEREMY CORBIN THIS PROGRAMME UNDERSTANDS LABOUR'S ANY SEA HAS SUSPENDED ALL ROUTINE CONSTITUENCY AND BRANCH MEETINGS WHILE THE CONTEST TAKES PLACE BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION ONLY MEETINGS FOR NOMINATIONS AND CAMPAIGN PLANNING WILL GO AHEAD IAN WATSON REPORTS FROM WESTMINSTER
OWEN SMITH WERE ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION TO STAND FOR THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP ONCE HE'S SPOKEN TO MEMBERS BUSINESS SOUTH WALES CONSTITUENCY AT LATER TODAY HIS MATES JEREMY CORBIN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS BUT FAILED TO CONVINCE HIM TO STEP ASIDE AND AVOID THE POTENTIALLY BRUISING CONTEST MISTER SMITH TOLD TO B. B. C. HE AGREED WITH THE DECISION OF LABOUR'S RULING NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE LAST NIGHT TO PUT TO MISTER CORBIN ON THE BALLOT THAT'S MEMBERS NOT M.P.S SHOULD DECIDE WHO LEADS THEM
YOUR POSITIONED HIMSELF ON THE LEFT OF HIS PARTY AND TO THE LEFT OF THE OTHER CHALLENGER ANGELA EAGLE HE BELIEVES THAT MISTER CORBIN'S ARTIST EDITED POLICIES ARE RIGHT BUT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T SEE THE CURRENT LEADER AS A POTENTIAL PRIME MINISTER ACTUALLY EAGLE ARGUED LAST NIGHT THAT LABOUR AS A PARTY OF EQUALITY SHOULD THEIR ELECT A WOMAN LEADER AND STRESSED TO EXPERIENCE IN FRONT RANK POLITICS

# MEDICAL STAFF IN ENGLAND HAD BEEN TOLD TO TREAT SEPSIS WITH THE SAME URGENCY AS A SUSPECTED HEART ATTACK THE REGULATOR NICE SAYS IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A POSSIBLE DIAGNOSIS MUCH EARLIER WHEN TREATING PATIENTS HERE'S JANE DRAPER
SEPSIS IS THOUGHT TO CAUSE AS MANY AS TEN THOUSAND AVOIDABLE DEATHS EVERY YEAR IT'S DETECTED LATE IN MORE THAN A THIRD OF PATIENTS BECAUSE THE SYMPTOMS CAN BE VAGUE THIS FORM OF BLOOD POISONING DEVELOPS WHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM RUNS OUT OF CONTROL WHILE FIGHTING AN INFECTION
NICE WANTS DOCTORS AND NURSES TO CONSIDER SEPSIS MUCH EARLIER WHEN PATIENTS HAVE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS A FAST HEARTBEAT EXTREME TEMPERATURE OR FEVER THE GUIDANCE SAYS ANYONE THOUGHT TO HAVE THIS ILLNESS SHOULD BE SENT TO HOSPITAL BY AMBULANCE AND SEEN BY A SENIOR DOCTOR OR NURSE STRAIGHT AWAY ONCE
CARE SERVICES IN ENGLAND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER AND DISABLED FACE SIGNIFICANT CUTS THIS YEAR BECAUSE COUNCIL TAX INCREASES HAVEN'T RAISED ENOUGH MONEY TO MEET RISING COSTS A SURVEY OF DIRECTORS OF ADULT SOCIAL CARE FOUND THAT THE EXTRA MONEY DOESN'T EVEN COVER THE INCREASED STAFFING COSTS CREATED BY THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE OUR SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT ALISON HOLT REPORTS
ALL OF THE DIRECTORS WHO RUN THE COUNCIL SERVICES IN ENGLAND THAT HELP OLDER AND DISABLED PEOPLE WITH SUCH THINGS AS WASHING AND DRESSING TOOK PART IN THE SURVEY IT FOUND MOST LOCAL AUTHORITIES INCREASED COUNCIL TAX BY TWO PER CENT TO HELP PAY FOR ADULT SOCIAL CARE RAISING AN EXTRA THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS BUT THAT COVERED LESS THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING COSTS RESULTING FROM THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE
WITH COUNCIL BUDGET SQUEEZED AND MORE PEOPLE NEEDING SUPPORT DIRECTORS ONE SERVICES WILL HAVE TO BE CUT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH INSISTS COUNCILS WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE MONEY OVER TIME AND THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO MAKE SAVINGS
# THE NUMBER OF PROSECUTIONS FOR HATE CRIMES AGAINST DISABLED PEOPLE HAS RISEN BY MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT IN A YEAR THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE'S ANNUAL REPORT SHOWS THERE WERE NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE CASES IN THE TWELVE MONTHS TO APRIL RANGING FROM INSULTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO VERBAL ABUSE AND PHYSICAL ASSAULTS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HATE CRIME PROSECUTIONS HAS ALSO RISEN BY JUST UNDER FIVE PERCENT WITH MORE THAN FOUR OUT OF FIVE CLASSED AS RACIALLY OR RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED
THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS ALISON ALISON SAUNDERS TOLD US IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN AN INCREASE IN OFFENCES OR SIMPLY OF REPORTING
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT SOME OF THIS IS BECAUSE THOSE INCREASE CONFIDENCE AND PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT ACTUALLY SOME OF THIS WHICH ORDINARILY PEOPLE MIGHT JUST THINK THEY HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THEY DON'T IT IS A CRIME AND THEY CAN REPORT IT AND IT WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND SOME OF IT MAY POSSIBLY BE AN INCREASING OFFENCES AS SUCH

THE GROUP SAYS THREE TO FOUR PEOPLE A SEIZED EVERY DAY USUALLY WHEN HEAVILY ARMED SECURITY FORCES STORMED THEIR HOMES MANY ARE HELD FOR MONTHS AT A TIME AND OFTEN BLINDFOLDED AND HANDCUFFED FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD AND MISTY ACCUSES THE JUDICIARY OF COMPLICITY AND SAYS THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE REPEATEDLY DENIED THAT ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES ARE HAPPENING
# RESCUE WORKERS ARE STILL AT THE SCENE OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL CRASH IN SOUTHERN ITALY IN WHICH AT LEAST TWENTY THREE PEOPLE DIED TWO PASSENGER TRAINS COLLIDED HEAD ON NEAR THE CITY OF BARI A REPORTER DAN JOHNSON IS THERE
TEAMS HAVE WORKED THROUGH THE NIGHT CLEARING THE REMAINS OF THE WRECKED CARRIAGES FROM THE LINE THIS MORNING THEY KEEP PILING UP THE TWISTED METAL ONTO A SCRAP HEAP THAT GIVES SOME IDEA OF THE FORCE INVOLVED IN THIS IMPACT OCCASIONALLY WORKERS DISCOVER ANOTHER BODY

# NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS VINCENT VAN GOGH CUT OFF HIS ENTIRE EAR RATHER THAN JUST PART OF IT AS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN THOUGHT
THE EVIDENCE WAS DISCOVERED IN A LETTER BY THE DOCTOR WHO TREATED HIS WOUNDS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH INCLUDES SKETCHES OF THE AMPUTATION IT ALSO SUGGESTS THE WOMAN THE ARTIST GAVE THE YEAR TO WHO WAS NOT A PROSTITUTE BUT ARE MADE IN A BROTHEL WHO HAD BEEN INJURED BY A DOG BITE THE RESEARCHER WHO UNCOVERED THE LETTER BERNADETTE MURPHY TOLD THIS PROGRAMME SHE ALSO QUESTIONED THE WIDESPREAD BELIEF THAT HE'D BEEN DRIVEN MAD BY DRINKING
I CAN'T FIND IT BEING SOLD PARTICULARLY IN ART AT THE TIME WAS VERY COMMON IN PARIS BUT IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY COMING IN NOT SO I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE OVER EXAGGERATED THE IDEA OF ALCOHOL BEING THE COURSE AND WHEN YOU SEE THE DRAWING IT ALL COMES TO LIFE THAT THE MAN WAS CREATING WHILE HE WAS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS
# THE AUTHOR BERNADETTE MURPHY IT'S NOW TEN PAST EIGHT IT'S BOUND TO BE A DAY OF HIGH EMOTION TEARS FOND FAREWELLS NO DOUBT CRIES OF GOOD RIDDANCE HAS DAVID CAMERON LEAVES DOWNING STREET FOR THE LAST TIME SMILES GOOD WISHES AND ANXIETY LOTS OF ANXIETY AS HIS SUCCESSOR TERESA MAY TAKES HIS PLACE IN A MOMENT WE'LL HEAR FROM A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE INCOMING PRIME MINISTER'S TEAM BUT FIRST NONE OF THAT EMOTION
WILL BE ANYTHING LIKE AS RAW AS THE RAGE CURRENTLY GRIPPING THE LABOUR PARTY HAS IT AGONISES OVER WHO SHOULD FACE MISSUS MAY AS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION AND NEXT POTENTIAL PRIME MINISTER STEP FORWARD THEN THIS MORNING OWEN SMITH WHO WAS UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO LABOUR'S SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY AND WHO ANNOUNCES TODAY THAT HE WILL CHALLENGE JEREMY CORBIN FOR THAT JOB GOOD MORNING TO YOU MISSUS SMITH GOOD MORNING
JEREMY IS THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY HE WON A STONKING GREAT MAJORITY HE'S TAKING US INTO THE ELECTION IN TWENTY TWENTY END OF QUOTE OWEN SMITH JANUARY WHAT CHANGED
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS CHANGED I THINK THE DRAMATIC COLLAPSE OR FAITH AND CONFIDENCE IN JEREMY AND THE WIDESPREAD BELIEF NOW IN THE LABOUR PARTY THAT WHILST JEREMY HE'S A GOOD MAN WITH GREAT LABOUR VALUES WHO HAS DONE A LOT FOR THIS PARTY AND I THINK CHANGED THE DEBATE IN THIS COUNTRY ABOUT OUR ECONOMY HE'S BEEN A RIGHT ABOUT LOTS OF THINGS ANTI HYSTERICALLY BUT HE IS NOT A LEADER WHO CAN LEAD US INTO AN ELECTION AND WIN FOR LABOUR AND WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD
TO HAVE A DAY LIKE TODAY WITH THE TORIES ARE POPPING CHAMPAGNE CORKS AND CELEBRATING THE VAIR CORONATION AND THE PROSPECT OF A LABOUR GOVERNMENT FEELS SO DISTANT FOR WORKING PEOPLE WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT IN LABOUR WE NEED TO TURN THE PAGE JOHN MACDONALD THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR IS CLEAR WHAT CHANGED PLOTTING AND CANAL LEAVING IS WHAT HE SAID AT A RALLY YESTERDAY THE ONLY GOOD THING SAID MISTER MCDONNELL ABOUT IT WAS THE PLOTTERS WERE EFFING USELESS AND I QUOTE
THAT'S NOT LANGUAGE HE SHOULD BE USING AS SHADOW CHANCELLOR IT'S SYDNEY NOT LANGUAGE I WOULD BE USING BUT THE TRUTH IS JOHN MACDONALD IS PART OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THE LABOUR PARTY I WANTED THIS TO BE RESOLVED WITHOUT A DAMAGING DIVISIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST I WANTED JEREMY CORBIN TO FIND A WAY TO HEAL THE LABOUR PARTY TO BRING US BACK AND UNITE US I'VE PUT THAT IN ON THREE OCCASIONS TO JOHN MCDONNELL I SAID I FEARED THAT HIS HE DID DECIDED THE PEOPLE ON HIS PART OF THE PARTY
WANTED TO SPLIT THE LABOUR PARTY AND HE SAID TO ME HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE SAID IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES I AM NOT PREPARED TO STAND BY AND LET THE LABOUR PARTY THE PARTY I LOVE THAT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST FORCE FOR GOOD IN THIS COUNTRY SPLIT IT CANNOT HAPPEN YOU MAKE THAT SOUND TERRIBLY REASONABLE BUT IN REALITY HE SURELY YOU WERE DOING THIS YOU WERE GOING TO SEE THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY A MAN WHO STILL IT SEEMS HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE MEMBERSHIP AND YOU WERE SAYING TO HIM QUIT
OR I ALONG WITH LABOUR M.P.S WERE REFUSED TO WORK WITH YOU WILL SPLIT THE PARTY AND WILL LAUNCH A LEADERSHIP BID YOU SAY IT'S DISTRACTING ON THE DAY THERE'S A NEW PRIME MINISTER WHO'S DOING THE SPLITTING WHO'S DOING THE DISTRACTING THEY WILL SAY IT TO YOU LET ME BE TOTALLY CLEAR I WAS NOT EVER PART OF ANY PLOT OR COUP AGAINST JEREMY CORBIN I REFUSED TO HAVE ANY PART IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND I THINK
IT HAS BEEN DESTRUCTIVE FORM A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT WHO JUST LIKE THOSE ON THE LEFT IT SEEMS TO ME PREPARED TO SEE LABOUR SPIT I PUT TO JEREMY I MET WITH HIM THREE TIMES IN THE LAST TEN DAYS SAYING THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS YOU CAN COMPROMISE BUT MY FEAR IS WHAT JEREMY'S VERY TASTY THIS TERRITORY AS BEYOND SIMPLY BY PUTTING IN A SERIES OF DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES FOR HIM TO HEAL THE PARTY NOT AS RECENTLY AS TWO DAYS AGO THESE HAVE BEEN REJECTED AND I THINK THAT LEAVES PEOPLE LIKE ME NICK
WHO LOVE THIS PARTY AND WANT TO SEE A LABOUR GOVERNMENT FORCED TO PUT A HAT IN THE RING AND SAY I CAN HEAL THIS PARTY I CAN BE A CREDIBLE LADEN LABOUR LEADER AND THE NEXT LABOUR PRIME MINISTER PEOPLE LIKE YOU SAYING MANY PEOPLE WELL NOT TO BE FAIR I KNOW WHO YOU ARE NOW
MIGHT NOT BE SURPRISING BUT YOU'RE A WELSH M.P. YOU WERE TAKING PART IN THE WELSH LEADERS' DEBATES AT THE GENERAL ELECTION AND YET A RECENT POLL YOU'LL BE FAMILIAR WITH IT SAID THAT SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF PEOPLE ASKED FOR A VIEW OF YOU AS THE NEXT LABOUR LEADER ACTUALLY HADN'T GONE OPINION THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE WHERE'S ANGELA EAGLE THEY REPRESENTS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND WAS BETTER KNOWN
ANGELA EAGLE'S BEEN IN PARLIAMENT FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS QUARTER OF A CENTURY I'VE BEEN IN PARLIAMENT FOR SIX YEARS AND IN THE WELSH JOB FOR A PERIOD OF THAT SO I'M NOT SURPRISED ABOUT THAT BUT THEY'RE GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO KNOW ABOUT ME THEY'RE GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO ABOUT HOW ARE YOU WILL BE A RADICAL INCREDIBLE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY AND HOW I CAN HEAL A PARTY AND PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE LABOUR PARTY WANT THAT LET'S GET A SENSE OF YOU AND I'M AFRAID THIS HAS TO BE QUICK FIRE THERE'LL BE OTHER OCCASIONS FOR YOU TO SPELL OUT IN MORE DETAIL BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW YOU IRAQ WAR FOR OR AGAINST
AGAINST I WASN'T IN PARLIAMENT UP THE TIME I WOULD HAVE VOTED AGAINST I WAS OPPOSED TO IT AT THE TIME IF PARLIAMENT VOTES NEXT WEEK AS WE EXPECT IT TO DO TO SAY THAT TONY BLAIR WAS IN CONTEMPT OF PARLIAMENT DO YOU VOTE TO SAY WAS THAT HE LIED OR NOT NO I DON'T THINK I WOULD VOTE DOG TONY IN CONTEMPT I THINK THAT IT WAS CLEARLY THE WRONG DECISION FOR US TO GO TO WAR BUT I THINK THIS IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED IN CONDEMNING ONE INDIVIDUAL TRIDENT FOR OR AGAINST
I WANT A MULTILATERAL DISARM THE WORLD I AM SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE A MEMBER OF C. N. D.I. FUNDAMENTALLY WANT THE WORLD TO BE WITHOUT NUCLEAR BOMBS HOWEVER I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT WE PRESENTLY DO NEED TO RETAIN A NUCLEAR CAPABILITY IN THIS COUNTRY I WILL VOTE TO RETAIN NUCLEAR BOMBS ON WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE LIKE VERNON KOKO THIS MORNING YOU SAID FORMER NORTHERN IRELAND SPOKESMAN FOR YOUR PARTY IT IS CLEARLY RIDICULOUS TO HAVE TWO CANDIDATES ARE POSING JEREMY CORBIN
NOT ONLY THERE SAYING YOU SPLIT THE LABOUR PARTY OR SPLITTING THOSE WHO WERE OPPOSED TO JEREMY CORBETT'S LEADERSHIP OF THE LABOUR PARTY ONE OF THE THINGS JEREMY HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ABOUT IS THAT THE MEMBERS IN THE LABOUR PARTY FUNDAMENTALLY MATTER AND THE MEMBERS I THINK WILL BE PLEASED THERE JEREMY CORBIN IT'S ON THE BALLET TODAY IT'S THE RIGHT DECISION BY THE ANY SEE IN THE MEMBERS WILL WANT A WIDE CHOICE PLACED BEFORE THEM I THINK I'VE GOT A RADICAL INCREDIBLE SET OF POLICIES I WANNA PUT THAT IN THE MEMBERSHIP I WANNA MAKE MY CASE TO BE THE NEXT LEADER OFF
NOT JUST THE LABOUR PARTY BUT THE NEXT LABOUR PRIME MINISTER FINALLY LET ME PUT BACK TO YOU THE QUESTION YOU PUT TO JOHN MCDONNELL ISN'T THE TRUTH THAT YOU'RE READY TO SPLIT THIS PARTY IF YOU DON'T GET YOUR WAY NO I WILL NEVER SPLIT THE LABOUR PARTY I WOULD BE LABOUR TILL THE DAY I DIE AND I WILL STICK WITH MY LABOUR PARTY THROUGHOUT HER YOU'LL GO BACK TO SAYING WHAT YOU SAID JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO JEREMY CORBIN IS THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY HE'S THE LEADER TILL THE ELECTION END OFF I WILL STAND IN THIS ELECTION AND I WILL DO THERE
DECENT THING AND FIGHT JEREMY CORBIN ON THE ISSUES JUST AS HE WILL DO WITH ME AND AT THE END OF THAT I WILL STAND BEHIND WHOEVER THE LEADER IS BUT I HOPE AND I EXPECT IT WILL BE ME OWEN SMITH THANK YOU THANKS A LOT
# IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND WHATEVER SHAPE THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP TAKES THE FRONT BENCH OPPOSITE THEM IN PARLIAMENT WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT VERY SOON THERESA MAY WILL BE ANNOUNCING HER CABINET REPORTEDLY ONE WITH SEVERAL WOMEN IN HIGH PROFILE POSITIONS HER LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN WAS RUN BY CHRIS GRADING CURRENTLY THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND HE'S IN OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO GOOD MORNING MY
ARE YOU HOPING TO BE REWARDED WITH ONE OF THE BIG JOBS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER PERHAPS I WAS VERY CLEAR WHEN I AGREED TO TAKE ON SHARING TERESA'S CAMPAIGN THAT I DIDN'T WANT JOB OFFERS I DIDN'T WANT TO DO DEALS IT'S ALL ABOUT HER PICKING THE RIGHT PEOPLE FOR THE JOB THAT SHE'S GOT AND I'LL DO WHATEVER IF ANYTHING SHE ASKED ME TO DO AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR EVERYONE THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT TEAM TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES WE FACE
BUT HOW IMPORTANT WILL IT BE TO YOU OR SOMEONE WHO SUPPORTED LEAVE IN THE REFERENDUM THAT EITHER YOU OR SOMEONE FROM THE SAME SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT AS YOU GET ONE OF THOSE BIG JOBS TERESA'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THE MINISTER WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LEADING THE PROCESS OF TAKING US OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL BE SOMEBODY WHO CAMPAIGNED TO LEAVE YOUR OPINION AND I THINK THAT'S VERY SENSIBLE IT WILL ENSURE CONFIDENCE AMONGST THOSE IN THE PARTY YOU DID CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE
THAT THEY HAVE A CHAMPION WHO BELIEVES IN WHAT THEY COMPARE CAMPAIGN FOUGHT IT WHO THAT IS AMONGST MANY OF US THAT BE A MATTER FOR THERESA BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND PROPER THAT PROCESS SHOULD BE LED BY SOMEBODY WHO WAS AT THE HEART OF THE LEAD CAMPER AND IF NONE OF THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT REALLY TOP JOB CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER FOREIGN SECRETARY HOME SECRETARY GO TO A BRICKS AT HER YOU WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THERESA NOW LOOKS UPON THE PARTY US NOT BRECK SITTERS NOT STAY AS NOT REMAIN AS SNOT LEAVE US
BUT ACTUALLY A TEAM OF CONSERVATIVES WHO HAVE A MANDATE FROM THE COUNTRY TO DELIVER NOT SIMPLY PRAXIS BUT ALSO THE AGENDA WE WERE ELECTED ON A YEAR AGO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT ONE NATION AGENDAS CONTINUE THAT WE CONTINUE THE REFORMS THAT WE'VE BEEN PURSUING OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS AND I SPRAY MUCH BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT THE BEST PEOPLE FOR THE JOB NOW OF COURSE TERESA IS GOING TO WORK WANT TO MAKE SURE SHE'S GOT IT BALANCE TICKET THERE REPRESENTS THE VIEWS ARE DIFFERENT PARTS THE PARTY
EVERY SENSIBLE PRIME MINISTER DOES THAT BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE FOR THE ROLLS BUT A BIG PART OF THE AGENDA ON WHICH YOU ELECTED A YEAR AGO WAS THE ECONOMY AND THE PLEDGES FOR EXAMPLE TO IT TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT IT'S INTERESTING TO CONTRAST THAT WITH WHAT THERESA MAY SAID IN A SPEECH EARLIER ON THIS WEEK WHERE
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE SO HOW WILL HER ECONOMIC POLICIES BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE I THINK THAT INEVITABLY A NEW PRIME MINISTER BRINGS NEW IDEAS TO THE JOB BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WILL BE A COMMON THREAD ALL THE WAY THROUGH WHAT WE DO US A GOVERNMENT IF YOU TAKE THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WHICH GEORGE OSBORNE INTRODUCED IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS
VERY MUCH A PART OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYONE MOVING FROM BEING A HIGH WELFARE LOW WAGE SOCIETY TO A HIGHER WAGE LOWER WELFARE SOCIETY SURELY THE BEST WAY TO GO AHEAD WITH THINGS THAT'S A PROCESS WE STARTED AN UNCERTAIN WE WANT TO CONTINUE OR PUBS SO SOME OF THE MORE LEFT WING IDEAS THEN WILL BE IF WE CAN CALL THEM THAT WILL BE WILL BE PART OF THIS WEEK SHE TALKED ABOUT SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON CORPORATE PAY BEING BINDING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LEFT WING AND WHEN I DO I THINK
THE TAG OF RIGHT AND LEFT CAN BE SOMETIMES MEANINGLESS IN TODAY'S WORLD I MEAN THAT DOES THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE REPRESENT A LEFT WING POLICY OR RIGHT WING POLICY DOES A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON WELFARE GETTING PEOPLE INTO WORK REPRESENT A RIGHT WING POLICY OR A LEFT WING POLICY LET'S LET'S LET'S LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THE BUDGET SURPLUS SHE'S DITCH THAT IDEA ALREADY AND WHEN SHE TALKS FUNNY CONNIE THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE THAT'S A STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT TONE FROM ONE THAT TALKS
PRIMARILY ABOUT REDUCING THE DEFICIT WE SEE I THINK WE WERE ELECTED TWELVE MONTHS AGO ON A PLATFORM OF ONE NATION CONSERVATISM ON THE PLATFORM OF CONTINUING SOCIAL REFORMER OF ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT LIFE CHANCES THE FINAL DISCUSSION IN DAVID CAMERON'S FINAL CABINET MEETING YESTERDAY WAS ABOUT A LIFE CHANCES AGENDA AND THIS UNIVERSAL SUPPORT AROUND THE CABINET TABLE FOR THAT AND ACROSS THE PARTY
WE DO NOT SUCCEED OR SAME NATION BY HAVING PARTS OF A PUT A POPULATION SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY SIMPLY LEFT BEHIND IT ACTUALLY LOWERS OUR PRODUCTIVITY LOWERS OUR ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS AS WELL US BEING DIVISIVE SOCIALLY SO IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IN EVERY RESPECT WHAT IS THE RIGHT THING THAT SHE SHOULD DO ON ON THE BRICKS AT NEGOTIATIONS AND TRIGGERING ARTICLE FIFTY FOR IT FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS IT MAID MADE YOU THINK
SHE WOULD DELIVER BRECK'S IT WELL ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT I'VE KNOWN THERESA FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS SHE WAS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST PEOPLE I KNEW WHEN I JOINED THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY I KNOW THAT SHE IS THE KIND OF PERSON IF SHE'S GIVEN A TASK AND SHE'S BEEN GIVEN THE MANDATE BY THE ELECTORATE SHE WILL SEE THAT THROUGH AND SHE'LL SEE IT WELL AND SHE'LL DO IT IN THE INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT TO ME WAS CRUCIAL I LOOKED IN THE EYE I GOT A PROMISE FOR HER BUT SHE REALLY MEANT THE BRAKES IT MEANT BRECHT'S IT AND I FEEL VERY HAPPY THAT SHE IS THE PERSON WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND THE SKILLS
TO CAUSE AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WHERE SHE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN OTHER GOVERNMENT'S NEGOTIATING COMPLICATED TREATIES LIKE THE ONE TO EXTRADITE ABU QATADA SHE WILL DO THIS HE SHALL DO THIS WELL BUT SHE'LL ALSO DO IT CAREFULLY AND I'M VERY CLEAR AND I SAID IT RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH THE THE CAMPAIGN THAT WE NEED TO TAKE THIS PROCESS CAREFULLY WE SHOULDN'T RUSSIANS TRIGGERING ARTICLE FIFTY WE SHOULD DO A PREPARATORY WORK WE SHOULD BE CERTAIN ABOUT WHAT OUR OBJECTIVES ARE AND THEN WE SHOULD START THE FORMAL PROCESS AND WE'LL SEE
CONTINUE THIS PROCESS WILL BEGIN THIS PROCESS WITH THE WITH THE HELP OF A OF A FIFTY FIFTY GENDER BALANCED CABINET IS THAT HER AIM I DOUBT HAVE TERESA WILL BE LOOKING AT A STATISTICAL BASIS BUT SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A CHAMPION OF GETTING MORE WOMEN INTO PARLIAMENT AND THAT'S GOOD IF YOU LOOK AT THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY TODAY COMPARED WITH WHEN I WAS ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND WON WHEN I WAS ACTING TWO THOUSAND ONE AMONGST THE THIRTY THREE NEW CONSERVATIVE M.P.S THAT ONE WAS A WOMAN
THAT WAS CLEARLY NOT RIGHT SIXTEEN YEARS LATER WE'RE NOW IN A POSITION WHERE WE'VE GOT A MUCH MORE BALANCED PARLIAMENTARY PARTY WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY TALENTED WOMEN WHO ARE IN MINISTERIAL POSITIONS WHO ARE ASPIRING TO MINISTERIAL POSITIONS SO WE GET A BETTER MORE BALANCE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE NATION WE LIVE IN PARTY AND THAT'S THE RIGHT THING CHRIS GRAYLING THANK YOU LISTENING TO ANNOUNCE OUR POLITICAL EDITOR ANOTHER QUIET DAY FOR LAURA COONS BIRD LAURA MORNING TEA
NOT MUCH TO DO TODAY REALLY HE WOULD NOW WE'VE ALL BEEN TOLD WE SHOULD BE PEG YOUR ATTENTION TO THE WOMEN THEY WILL END UP COMING INTO MORE SENIOR ROLES IN THE CABINET BUT I WONDER IF THE BIGGER DECISION FOR THERESA MAY TODAY IS ACTUALLY ABOUT THREE MEN GEORGE OSBORNE AND MICHAEL GO AND BORIS JOHNSON SHE'S GOT TO WORK OUT WHAT ON EARTH TO DO WITH EACH OF THEM
HE DOES WORK IN THIS IS A BIG GENERATIONAL AND ALSO A STRATEGIC QUESTION WHAT DOES SHE DO WITH THOSE BIG NAMES WHO ARE SO STEEPED IN THEIR BEST AND ALSO THE WORST
NOT JUST OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS BUT HAVE THE LAST FEW YEARS BORIS JOHNSON GEORGE OSBORNE MICHAEL GOES NOW THERE IS A TEMPTATION WHICH WOULD BE A VERY BOLD MOVE TO MOVE THEM ALL OUT THAT WOULD SEND A VERY STRONG MESSAGE THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT
TIMES HAVE CHANGED THAT NOTTING HILL TORIES THE NOTTING HILL BOYS AS THEY'RE SOMETIMES KNOWN SOMETIMES KNOWN AS A REAL CLIQUE THEY WILL NOT HAVE A PLACE IN THIS WAY AND THEIR WAY OF DOING POLITICS IS OVER HOWEVER TERESA MADE CRICKET ALL ABOUT STABILITY
AND THERE'S A VERY STRONG DESIRE FOR THAT SUMMER GEORGE OSBORNE'S ALLIES EXPECT HIM BASICALLY TO DO A JOB SWAP WITH PHILIP HAMMOND THE CURRENT FOREIGN SECRETARY MOVE INTO THAT JOB AS PHILIP HAMMOND A SAFE PAIR OF HANDS MOVED INTO NUMBER ELEVEN THERE'S BEEN CHATTED TO YOU ABOUT MICHAEL GO STAYING WHERE HE IS AT THE JUSTICE
APARTMENT EVEN KNOW SOME OF HIS RELATIONSHIPS ARE SO BROKEN WITH SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES LET HIM STAY WHERE HE IS LET HIM GET ON WITH PRISON REFORM WHICH HE SEEMS TO CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT BUT LIKE PREVIOUS TORY LEADERS IS A BIG QUESTION WHAT DO YOU DO WITH BORIS JOHNSON OF COURSE DAVID CAMERON HAD BASICALLY PROMISED HIM A JOB IN THE CABINET THAT EVEN BEEN SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT
THE JOB MIGHT BE AFTER THE REFERENDUM BUT FOR TERESA MAY I THINK THAT FOR HER NOT TO HAVE HIM AROUND THE TABLE WOULD BE LOSING OUT ON HAVING A BIG TORY ACTIVISTS CHEERLEADER HAVING SOMEONE WHO'S GOT BIG PUBLIC PROFILE BIG POPULARITY IN THE COUNTRY
# BUT SOMEONE HERE SHALL WE SAY SHE MIGHT NOT SEE HE'S ALWAYS BEEN RELIABLE MEANTIME THE SMALL MATTER OF A CRISIS IN THE LABOUR PARTY WHO IT MIGHT BE STEP FORWARD OWEN SMITH WILL THAT BE GREETED WITH CHEERS AND THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY OR BOOZE AS PEOPLE SAY WE NEED ONE CANDIDATE WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU CONFUSING
I THINK BOTH ARE LOOK GOING SMITH I THINK YOU COULD TALK ABOUT THIS VERY CAREFULLY HE'S OBVIOUSLY CONSULTED WITH COLLEAGUES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE'S LAUNCHING SOME KIND OF MISSION WHERE GOING GONNA FALL OFF THE EDGE OF A CLIFF AND LAND IN THE SUMP AT THE BOTTOM ON HIS OWN WONDERING WHY HE TOOK THIS KIND OF RACE OR WHETHER OR NOT HE'S GOING TO LAUNCH HIMSELF OFF INTO A CONTEST THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY WIN HE DOES HAVE PEOPLE AROUND HIM YOU BELIEVE THAT HE CAN DO IT HE SAID SORRY TO DROP BUT HE SAID WITH ENORMOUS CONFIDENCE AT THE END OF MY INTERVIEW AND I WILL WIN
HE DOES BELIEVE THAT AND I THINK CRUCIAL TO THAT IS THE FACT THAT HE WASN'T IN PARLIAMENT DURING THE IRAQ WAR AND HE THEREFORE DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE IRAQ WAR AND WE KNOW THAT AMONG LABOUR ACTIVE
THE NEW GENERATION WHO'VE COME IN TO THE PARTY SINCE JEREMY CORBIN HAS BEEN IN CHARGE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE CLEAR TO ME HE'S PREPARED TO USE US AS AN ADVANTAGE OVER ANGELA EAGLE WHAT WAS ALSO CRITICAL THOUGH IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH YOU HE SAID THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A SMALL GROUP ON THE LEFT AND A SMALL GROUP ON THE RIGHT WHO SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN SPLITTING THE PARTY RATHER THAN KEEPING IT TOGETHER
THERE WILL BE M.P.S WHO WILL HAVE HEARD THAT AN ACTIVIST HUGH YOU PROBABLY WILL HANG THEIR HEADS AND BE VERY SORRY TO HAVE HEAR HIM GO DOWN THAT ROAD OF LAYING BLAME ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PARTY FOR THE MESS THAT THEY ARE NOW IN AND NO QUESTION THEIR M.P.S HAVE TALKED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE SAID WHATEVER IT'S THINKING I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO WE NEED TO HAVE ONE CANDIDATE IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY HOPE
JEREMY CORBIN INTERESTING TO WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO MARGARET HODGE SENIOR M.P. IN THE LAST HOUR OF THE PROGRAMME SUGGESTING IN THE END THEY MAY STILL BE ABLE TO HAVE ONE CANDIDATE IT COULD BE JUST SAY IT COULD BE THAT THE EARLY WEEKS OF THE CONTEST SEE ANGELA EAGLE I OWEN INSPECT BOTH INVOLVED BUT IN THE END IT COMES DOWN TO ONE CANDIDATE WHO TAKES ON JEREMY
BUT IT'S SO MUCH AND PLAYS SO MUCH IN STATE WHO KNOWS THINGS IS SO SURPRISING THE MOMENT THEY MAY EVEN BE ANOTHER CANDIDATE YET TO A MARRIAGE NO KIDS NO MORE TO KEEP YOU BUSY VENEER HAD A REFERENDUM AND CHANGE OF PRIME MINISTER CHANGE OF LABOUR LADY MUST BE BORED AT THE JOB REALLY BUT THANK YOU
# IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND CHRIS DENNIS IS HERE WITH THE SPORT HOPEFULLY TO CALM US DOWN CHRIS YEAH NOTHING BORING ABOUT THE SPORTS NEWS THIS MORNING THIS MORNING'S HEADLINES INCLUDE AN EMBARRASSING ONE NIL DEFEAT FOR CELTIC BY A PART TIME TEAM FROM GIBRALTAR IN THE SECOND QUALIFYING ROUND OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IT WAS BRENDAN RODGERS FIRST COMPETITIVE MATCH IN CHARGE AND A CALL FROM RORY MCILROY THIS MORNING FOR MORE DRUG TESTING IN GOLF AFTER ADMITTING THAT HE COULD EASILY TAKE BANNED SUBSTANCES UNDETECTED IF HE SO
THE FIRST TEST OF THE SUMMER SERIES AGAINST PAKISTAN STARTS AT LORD'S TOMORROW GARY BALANCE ARE SET TO RETURN TO THE BATTING LINE UP JAMES ANDERSON WILL BE MISSING THROUGH INJURY BUT THE BIG TALKING POINT IS THE RETURN TO INTERNATIONAL CRICKET OF THE PAKISTAN FAST BOWLER MOHAMMAD AMIR AFTER SERVING A FIVE YEAR BAN AND A PRISON SENTENCE FOR SPOT FIXING
AMIR WAS FOUND GUILTY AND MEMBER OF DELIBERATELY BOWLING NO BALLS IN THE CORRESPONDING TEST AT LORD'S SIX YEARS AGO I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THE ENGLAND CAPTAIN ALISTAIR COOK AND I ASKED HIM HOW HE FEELS ABOUT HIS RETURN
IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING TUNNELS I PLAYED IN THAT TEST MATCH IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND IT WAS A VERY VERY STRANGE TEST MATCH AT LORD'S HE'S ACCEPTED HIS PUNISHMENT WAS DONE HIS PUNISHMENT HE'S DONE HIS TIME AND HE'S BACK I THINK ONE THING WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE
ICI SI DO IS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A NO TOLERANCE THING TO MATCH FIXING FOR NOW ON BECAUSE NOW WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GAME
THAT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING OR PLAYING AS A GENUINE GAME WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE THOSE WHISPERS ABOUT IT WILL TARNISH THE GAME DO YOU SEE A DIFFERENCE ACTUALLY BETWEEN MATCH FIXING AND SPOT FIXING THAT HE WAS SPECIFICALLY FOUND GUILTY
NO I DON'T I THINK ANYONE WHO MAKES FINANCIAL GAINS FROM AGAIN A CRICKET FOR UNDERPERFORMING IS IS A SIMPLE IS THE SAME THING REALLY ISN'T IT IN MY OPINION
WE'VE GOT THIS GOT TO BE A DETERRENT TO WHICH STOPS PEOPLE DOING IT AS I SAID WE PEOPLE WHO PAY GOOD MONEY TO WATCH GAMES OF CRICKET WON IT NO THAT IS A CONTESSA GENUINE CONTEST AND IT'S BOTH SIDES YOU KNOW INCLUDE THE UMPIRES AND EVERYONE INVOLVED ARE GIVEN THEIR BEST
TRY AND WIN THAT GAME OF CRICKET WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A DETERRENT WHICH IF PEOPLE DO GET TEMPTED BY EXTRA MONEY FOR DOING THAT I THINK THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE HIGH INCREDIBLY HIGH TO STOP STOP THAT
ANY SYMPATHY FOR HIM AT ALL HE WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN LET'S NOT FORGET AND I'M SURE HE WAS UNDER QUITE A LOT OF PRESSURE TO YOU IN THE RESTING THEM TEAM HAVE IN A STRANGE SORT OF WAY SOME SYMPATHY FOR HIM
YOU UNDERSTAND IT MUST HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY TOUGH TIME FOR HIM WITH OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND IN THAT IN THAT SITUATION WE CERTAINLY WITH THE HIERARCHICAL SYSTEM THE WAY PAKISTAN WORK WAS I SUPPOSE AYE CAPTAIN AS WELL RIGHT I DO HAVE SOME SYMPATHY WITH HIM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG AS WELL
HE DID SOMETHING WHICH I'M SURE IS NOT VERY PROUD OF HIS PUNISHMENT FOR THAT AND HE'S COMING BACK TO PLAY NOW AND IT'S GREAT FOR THE GAME OF CRICKET BECAUSE HE IS HE'S A WORLD CLASS BALLROOM ONE OF ONE OF THE BEST AROUND WHAT SORT OF RECEPTION DO YOU THINK YOU'LL GET FROM THE LORD'S CROWD
I DON'T KNOW IT'S ALWAYS AN EMOTIVE SUBJECT ISN'T IT IT WILL BE AN EMOTIVE TIME AS AN ENGLAND SIDE WE HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY THE SERIES YOU'RE NOT US ENGLAND AND PAKISTAN HISTORICALLY IS ALWAYS HAD SOME CONTROVERSIAL MOMENTS
I HOPE FOR THIS FOUR TEST MATCH SERIES WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE GAME A GOOD TEA VERY GOOD SIDES GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND PLAYING SINGLE CRICKET AND WE TALK ABOUT THE ON PHIL STUFF RATHER THE FIELD STUFF AWAY FROM MOHAMMED AMIR HIMSELF HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ALASTAIR THAT MATCH FIXING IS STILL OUT THERE AND IS STILL BEING DONE AS WE SPEAK
I GENERALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I HOPE IT'S NOT GOING ON COS I REALLY WANT TO BE WATCHING THE GAME OF CRICKET AND HOPING THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUT OFF HER WHAT SAY WHAT'S HAPPENED TO MOHAMMAD MOHAMMAD AMIR AND REALISE HOW GREAT THE GAME OF CRICKET IS
WE'VE GOT TO PROTECT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS THAT QUESTION AND I JUST HOPE IN GOOD FACE THAT PEOPLE ARE
I'M DOING IT BECAUSE WE WERE SO LUCKY DO YOU PLAYING CRICKET FOR ENGLAND OR ANY COUNTRY AND WE SHOULD WEAR EVERY PLAYER HAS TO REALLY REMINDER THAT RESPONSIBLY SOMETIMES AND PEOPLE
DEFINITELY A DUE TO WATCH A FAIR CONTEST ALASTAIR COOK THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING AND ALL THE BEST FOR THE TEST SERIES AHEAD

# THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER SAID THAT HE DOESN'T THINK THAT HE'LL HAVE A PROBLEM DEALING WITH MISSUS MAY SPEAKING IN CHINA HEARD JOHN CLAW YONKERS SAID THAT THE TERMS OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD NOT BE NEGOTIATED IN A HOSTILE MOOD THE FORMER SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY OWEN SMITH IS TO STAND IN THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP CONTEST MISTER SMITH WHO'LL JOIN ANGELA EAGLE IN CHALLENGING JEREMY CORBIN TOLD US HE WOULD BE A RADICAL AND CREDIBLE LEADER WHO COULD HEAL THE RIFT IN THE PARTY
# DOCTORS IN ENGLAND ARE BEING URGED TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH THE SYMPTOMS OF SEPSIS AS URGENTLY AS THOSE WHO HAVE CHEST PAINS THE CONDITION IS THOUGHT TO CAUSE AS MANY AS TEN THOUSAND AVOIDABLE DEATHS EVERY YEAR AND COUNCIL SAY THAT ADULT SOCIAL CARE SERVICES MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT CUTS BECAUSE COUNCIL TAX INCREASES HAVEN'T RAISED ENOUGH MONEY TO MEET RISING COSTS THEY SAY THE EXTRA FUNDING WON'T EVEN COVER THE COST OF PAYING STAFF THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE
# TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE FOR A WORLD BOTH OF OUR MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES WERE IN A LEADERSHIP LINDO BUT FOR THE CONSERVATIVES THAT IS NOW OVER FOR LABOUR ALTHOUGH JEREMY CORBIN'S POSITION HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED BY THE FACT HE WON'T NEED THE SUPPORT OF M.P.S TO GET HIS NAME ON THE BALLOT PAPER
THE CONTEST IS WIDER ANOTHER M. P. OWEN SMITH HAS THROWN HIS HAT INTO THE RING AFTER ANGELA EAGLE WE'RE JOINED FROM WESTMINSTER BY THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MACDONALD GOOD MORNING MORNING IT'S QUITE A CONTRAST ISN'T IT THE CONSERVATIVES WHATEVER THEIR DIFFERENCES IN THE PAST LINING UP BEHIND A NEW PRIME MINISTER LABOUR IN TURMOIL TURMOIL WE'RE GOING INTO A TECHNOCRATIC COLLECTION THAT'S DEMOCRACY I THINK WE'VE GOT THREE CANDIDATES NOW THERE MIGHT WELL BE MORE SO THEY'LL HAVE HER
A GOOD I THINK AN INTERESTING POLICY DEBATE AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY OUR MEMBERS WILL DECIDE WHO THEY WANT AS LEAD ON THEN WILL UNITE BEHIND THAT LEADER YOU MAY NOT SEE IT AS A TURMOIL BUT LOOK AT THE DEATH THREATS AGAINST ANGELA EAGLE THE BRICK BEING THROWN INTO HER CONSTITUENCY OFFICE ANTI SEMITIC EMAILS SENT TO MARGARET HODGE WHICH IS REPORTED TO THE POLICE THAT'S A ABSOLUTELY APPALLING BUT LET'S FIRST LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS
CERTAINLY DURING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND SINCE THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THERE'S THE BIN LEVELS OF ABUSE AND OUR STREETS AS WELL I THINK THE POLITICAL CLIMATE AT THE MOMENT IS APPALLING IN TERMS OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON I DON'T THINK THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY ONE POLITICAL PARTY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I THINK THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALMOST OUTSIDE APOLOGISE SO YOU DON'T TAKE ANY SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT I MEAN YOU GIVE TALKED OF A COUP FOR EXAMPLE
THAT PUT A COUP IS NOT ABOUT A COUP WAS A POLITICAL PLOT IT'S NOT IT'S THIS WAY IT'S A WAY YOU CHOOSE TO TALK ABOUT A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE STARTED YET BUT IT'S A POET SORRY A AS A POLITICAL WORD THAT'S USED IN COMMON POLITICAL PARLANCE THAT'S NOT ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENCE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THE WHOLE EXERCISE THAT'S GOING ON AT THE MOMENT ACROSS ALL OUR POLITICAL PARTIES AND IF YOU HAVE LISTENED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ALL THE POLITICAL LEADERS
WHO SAID WE WILL NOT TOLERATE ABUSE THEY A SOCIETY WITHIN A POLITICAL SYSTEM AND ALL OF THEM TO A PERSON THE UNITED HAVE CONDEMNED IT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ALL DONE AND IF IF ANYONE
IF ANYONE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY POLITICAL PARTY THAT IS ENGAGED IN ANY FORM OF ABUSE WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE ACTION IS TAKEN THEY'RE KICKED OUT ALL RIGHT LET LET LET ME PLAY TO YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT THIS WAS A RECORDING THAT'S BEEN MADE BY THE GUARDIAN AS AS WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T BEING RECORDED PRESUMABLY IT WAS LAST NIGHT IN A RALLY OR LABOUR ALI THAT WAS HELD AFTER THE ANY SEA MEETING THIS IS WHAT YOU SAID

THERE'S A SMALL GROUP IN THE LABOUR PARTY WHO FROM DAY ONE HAVE NOT ACCEPTED JEREMY KORMAS MANDATE THEY JUST HAVEN'T AND WE'VE KNOWN THAT AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE LAST TEN MONTHS THAT THEY WERE WELL THEY WERE PLOTTING A COUP I'M AFRAID THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF JEREMY AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING NOW LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THAT'S HAPPENED IT'S BETTER TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT RATHER THAN TO TRY AND COVER IT UP THOUGH AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAY TO ME IF I'M GOING TO SAY COME ON PAUL COS YOU'RE DESTABILISING THE LABOUR PARTY
THEY'VE STOOD THEY'VE KEPT ON AT THAT AND THERE TRYING TO SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY THEY CAN TO UNDERMINE HIM NOT I THINK I REGRET THAT BUT THERE ARE TINY CROUP THE BULK OF THE LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS THE BULK OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY JUST WANNA GET ON WITH THE JOB OF CHANGING OUR SOCIETY I THINK AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS LEADERSHIP ELECTION WILL BRING OUT MY WELCOME ALL THE CANDLES COME BEFORE BECAUSE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SET OUT THEIR STALL WHAT THEIR POLICIES ARE HOW WE WANT TO GO FOR GLOVE A DEMOCRATIC DEBATE
IT WILL BE AN AMICABLE DEBATE IT WAS LAST YEAR THE CANDIDATES LAST YEAR GOT ON EXTREMELY WELL THAT WILL BE THE SAME THIS YEAR DON'T WHATEVER OUR MEMBERS DECIDE WHOEVER'S GOING TO BE THE LEADER WILL UNITE BEHIND THEM I THINK WILL FORM AN EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION DO YOU EVER ASK YOURSELF IF YOU AND JEREMY CORBIN AT THE TOP OF THE PARTY MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW WHY IS IT THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN A CLIMATE LIKE THIS IN THE PARTY SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTY I DON'T THINK IT IS I DON'T THINK IT IS ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE LABOUR PARTY AS SUCH I THINK THERE'S A POLITICAL CLIMATE UNFORTUNATELY WHICH CAN BE QUITE HOSTILE THAT THAT HE WAS SEEN THAT DURING THE AFFRONT TO CAMPAIGN AND SUBSEQUENT TO THAT IF YOU LOOK AT JEREMY'S STYLE OF POLITICS JEREMY IS THE MOST CARING COMPASSIONATE PERSON I'VE MET IN POLITICS AND HE'S TRIED TO INTRODUCE A MORE CARING AND KIND OF FORMER POLITICS KNEES ADVOCATE OF THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN
SOMETIMES THIS ABUSE GOES ON HE'S HAD A LOOK I I CAN'T SPEAK FOR HIM BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS NOW
THE LEVELS OF ABUSE HE SUFFERED HAVE BEEN A DISGRACE DEATH THREATS AFTER DEATH THREATS AND THE HAYES IS NOT MADE A BIG FUSS ABOUT THAT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT HE'S JUST CARRIED ON HIS CALM WAY AND I JUST HAVE NOTHING BUT RESPECT FROM IN THAT BUT ALSO WHAT HE'S DONE HE'S TRIED TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT HE'S MADE IT TIME AND TIME AND I HAVE AS WELL
CLEAR THE ABUSE SHOULD SHOULD NOT BE PART OF A POLITICS AND WILL STAMP IT OUT WHEREVER WE CAMP AT THAT YOU WON'T BE USING WORDS LIKE PLOTTERS AND CONNIVE US NO THAT'S JUST NORMAL POLITICS THAT IS OR YOU WILL BE USING THAT THAT'S NORMAL POLITICAL DESCRIPTION IS NOTHING TO DO LET'S BE CLEAR
THAT IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LEVELS OF ABUSE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON WHATSOEVER OF COURSE POLITICS CAN BE RUMBUSTIOUS IN DEBATE BUT THERE WERE WORDS THAT IT ISN'T ABUSE OF SUCH JOHN MCDONNELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE WE FOUND OUT TODAY WHICH ATHLETES WILL REPRESENT THE U.K. AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN RIO DE GENERIC SOME OF WORRIED ABOUT TRAVELLING TO BRAZIL BECAUSE OF ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT THE SEEKER VIRUS THE GOLFER FOR EXAMPLE RORY MCELROY WITHDREW FROM THE OLYMPICS LAST MONTH BLAMING FEARS ABOUT ZEKE
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION ADVICE IS THAT RIO SHOULD BE SAFE FOR TRAVELLERS OF THEM PREGNANT WOMEN OR THOSE WHO ARE THINKING OF CONCEIVING WE'RE DAVIS NOW REPORTS FROM THE OLYMPIC CITY WITH LESS THAN FOUR WEEKS TO GO BEFORE THE OPENING CEREMONY
SIX MONTHS AGO DEVASTATING NEWS AND MOSQUITO BORNE VIRUS THAT COULD HAVE TERRIBLE REPERCUSSIONS FOR NEW BORN BABIES WAS SWEEPING THROUGH BRAZIL
HAD ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY A YEAR BEFORE AND CASES OF MICROCEPHALY WERE BEEN REPORTED FROM THE NORTH EAST TO RE EDITION ERA WITH THE OBVIOUS RISK TO PREGNANT WOMEN THEY WERE EVEN CALLS FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES TO BE POSTPONED SO BLOOD HERE
THIS MUST GIVE SOMEBODY LOCK WAS ARE IN MY HANDS IN AREAS AROUND RIO'S OLYMPIC PARK WE FOUND PLENTY OF MOSQUITOES EVEN AS HEALTH OFFICIALS LED HIGH PROFILE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS BUT THE BRAZILIAN WINTER HAS SET IN MOSQUITOES ARE MORE SCARCE AND MANY EXPERTS LIKE PAOLO PARADE
AN OBSTETRICIAN FROM THE FERNANDEZ FORGET INSTITUTE CONCLUDE THE CITY WILL BE SAFE WE ARE NOT HIDING
NO WELL
I THINK BLACK WOULD HELP A BIT HE'S ASIAN
PREPARE TO RECEIVE
AUGUST THE FIFTH OPENING CEREMONY IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER AS WITH THE WORLD CUP TWO YEARS AGO BRAZIL IS RATHER LATE GETTING THINGS FINISHED INCLUDING THE TEMPORARY STADIUMS HERE ON COPPER CABANA BEACH BUT THE GAMES WILL GO AHEAD AND EXCEPT FOR THE FOUR TOP MALE GOLFERS IN THE WORLD MOST ATHLETES SELECTED WILL TRAVEL TO RIO DESPITE THE FEARS ABOUT ZEKE
IT'S THE RIGHT DECISION SAYS FIVE TIMES OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALLIST AND TEAM G.B. AMBASSADOR SIR STEVE REDGRAVE IS THAT OBVIOUSLY IT'S PORT MORTEM FRONT BECAUSE OF THAT THE MEN GOLFERS NOT THE FEMALE BUT THE MEN OFF
I THINK THEY'RE JUST USING ME AS AN EXCUSE WE'RE SAYING AND THE IRISH SAYING THE BRITISH OLYMPIC ASSOCIATION
HE'S O.K. TO GO PROPOSE
I'LL BUZZ YOU BRAZIL HE'S IN PUBLIC RELATIONS OVERDRIVE TO PROVE THAT THE COUNTRY IS READY INTERIM PRESIDENT MICHEL TEMA SAYING THAT HE'S NO LONGER A CONCERN AND THAT THOUSANDS OF TROOPS WILL KEEP THE CITY SAFE
NO DOUBT VISITORS AND VIEWERS AND LISTENERS AT HOME WILL EXPERIENCE THE BEST THAT RIO HAS TO OFFER THE LONG TERM PROSPECTS FOR RIO AND FOR BRAZIL SEEM LESS CERTAIN WITH ONLY WEEKS TO GO BEFORE THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH
THAT WAS WHERE A DAVIES REPORTING PROFESSOR TRUDY LANG LEADS TO GLOBAL HEALTH NETWORK AND IS BASED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS THE SCALE OF THE THREAT NOW POSED BY THE ZEKE A VIRUS
YEAH I THINK YOUR REPORT JUST NOW I WAS IT WAS VERY SENSIBLE AND SPOT ON I THINK IT'S ALL AROUND HAVING A PROPORTIONATE RESPONSE RELATIVE TO THE RISK AND THE INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH COMMUNITY I THINK WE'RE AT LEAST COMFORTED THE OLYMPICS IS KEPT SEEKER IN THE PUBLIC ATTENTION BUT IT'S NOT A REAL ISSUE DO YOU SENSE THAT SOME ATHLETES SOME GOLFERS PERHAPS OR PERHAPS USING IT AS A BIT OF AN EXCUSE THEY DON'T FANCY PLAYING IN THE OLYMPICS OF THE BLAMING THE VIRUS
I THINK I THINK A FEW MONTHS AGO IF YOU WEEKS AGO AND THERE WAS A CALL TO MOVE THE OLYMPICS IT WAS AROUND TWO ISSUES ONE WAS INDIVIDUAL RISK TO THE ATHLETES THEMSELVES IN THE SECOND
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER HE COULD BE SPARED FURTHER BY HAVING THE OLYMPICS RUNNING RIO AND AS REPORT TO STATE HER QUITE CORRECTLY IT'S NOW WINTER IN THE AIR AND THERE'S NOT MUCH AGE IS AROUND TWO TO BITE AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN AT A DIFFERENT TIME OF YEAR
AND ALSO THERE'S ZEKE IS GOING ON IN SIXTY COUNTRIES FOR THE DAY TO DAY TRAVEL IN AND OUT OF THOSE COUNTRIES IS IS IS IS THE ONGOING ISSUE AROUND SPREADING SEE CASE THAT'S A QUESTION AND NOT THE OLYMPICS AT ALL NOW THEY'RE REALLY INDIVIDUAL ATHLETE
THE INDIVIDUAL ATHLETES IT'S REALLY NOT A DARE PROPORTIONATE MISSED RELATIVE TO OTHER INFECTIONS THEY COULD GET ONE OF THEIR OTHER THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER EXPECTANT MOTHERS OR WISH TO BE SOON IS THAT SOMETHING THEY SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WE KNOW THE JENISA JESSICA ENNIS HILL HE'S NOT STAYING AT THE BRITISH TEAM CAMP FOR THESE OLYMPICS
EXACTLY AND THAT'S WHERE WHERE THE PUBLIC HOUSE PRICES VERY CLEAR THAT IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO BECOME PREGNANT THEN THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFERENT CASE WILL TOGETHER BECAUSE THEN THE RISK BECOMES MORE PROPORTIONATE TO YOUR INDIVIDUAL SITUATION
AND THEREFORE IN A SENSE YOU'RE YOU'RE PLEASED AS YOU SAY THIS IS HIGHLIGHTED PROBLEMS BUT THINK THAT OFTEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTRIBUTING THEIR DECISION NOT TO GO TO THE VIRUS ARE GETTING IT WRONG GETTING IT OUT
YES SEEKER IS STILL A MASSIVE PUBLIC OUT INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY AND THERE'S A HUGE COORDINATED RESEARCH RESPONSE JUST YESTERDAY WE WERE TALKING
WITH EUROPEAN COMMISSION ABOUT AND EUROPEAN FUNDING FANCY KURT RESEARCH AND
THIS IS THE REAL WORK THEY NEED TO GO ON STILL WE STILL NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE FIND OUT HOW WE CAN PREVENT AND TREAT IT AND IT'S OF COURSE A CONCERN FOR THE OLYMPICS BUT THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN VERY SENSIBLE PROFESSOR TREE THANK YOU
# THE TIME THAT IS A QUARTER TO NINE WHAT WILL BRECHT'S IT MEAN FOR BIG INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS PARTICULARLY THE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ESTIMATED TO BE NEEDED FOR PROJECTS ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE THAT NUMBER COMES FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS SIR JOHN AHMET WHO'S SETTING UP A GROUP TO ADVISE THE CABINET OFFICE ON THE CONCERNS OF THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR ON THE EFFECT OF LEAVING THE E.U. HE'S WITH US NOW GOOD MORNING SIR JOHN GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS OF THE SECTOR
VERY SIMPLY THE SECTOR RELIES VERY HEAVILY ON PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT FOR INVESTORS LOOK FOR CERTAINTY THOSE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN RESEARCH IN THE INDUSTRY WHICH IS QUITE CENTRAL TO THE INDUSTRY RELY ON EUROPEAN FUNDING TO A LARGE DEGREE
THE INDUSTRY IS RELIES ON EUROPEAN COATS AND STANDARDS AND USES THEM AND CONTINUES TO USE THEM AND I'M FINALLY SKILLS AS YOU MENTION ABSOLUTELY IN VITAL TO THE INDUSTRY AND TO DO A LOT OF THOSE SKILLS COME FROM EUROPE HOW SO HER OF THEIR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS THAT WILL BE NEEDED BY TWENTY TWENTY FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMMISSIONED HOW MANY OF THEM WOULD WOULD BE BRITISH DO YOU THINK AND HOW MANY WOULD WE NEED FROM OUTSIDE THE U.K.
IT'LL VARY ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BUT I WOULD EXPECT ROUGHLY TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT WOULD COME FROM OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY IN LONDON IT COULD BE HIGHER OH CASE BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE THEN TO IMAGINE THAT WE COULD TRAIN UP ENOUGH WORKERS TO FILL THAT GAP IF FOR EXAMPLE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
COMES TO AN END AS MOST PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING TO HAPPEN I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TRAIN UP THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM WITHIN THE U.K. WITH NO WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT HAPPEN FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS TO SUDDENLY REVERSE THAT TO FIND SUFFICIENT
PEOPLE IN THE U.K. WHO WANTED TO ENTER THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AT ALL LEVELS THIS IS NOT JUST LABOUR THIS IS ENGINEERING SKILLS WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT SO IT IS IT YOUR FEAR THAT EVEN PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE ARE GOING ARE GOING TO BE DELAYED ALL MADE MORE EXPENSIVE OR POSSIBLY EVEN NOT SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY
THEY COULD CERTAINLY BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE ARE THEY COULD BE DELAYED INVESTORS COULD DELAY BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE INDUSTRY TO DELIVER THEREFORE THOSE ARE RISKS AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO SEE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CERTAINTY AROUND THESE ISSUES FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE INDUSTRY AND THAT IS AN AREA WHICH HOPEFULLY THE GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE PROGRESS ON THE MAKE REACH AGREEMENT ON
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I REALISE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BUT WE NEED TO TRADE WITH EUROPE WE DO TRADE WITH EUROPE HAVE COMPANIES TRADE WITH EUROPE A RESEARCHER'S RELY ON EUROPEAN FUNDING PROJECTS RELY ON EUROPEAN FUNDING SO THERE ARE SOME BIG GAPS IN THE FUTURE OF INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH EUROPE AND THERE ARE QUESTION MARKS OVER A COUPLE OF BIG FUTURE PROJECTS AIRPORT EXPANSION IN THE SOUTH EASTERN H. S. TWO
AIRPORT EXPANSION THAT'S VERY CLEAR RECOMMENDATION BE MADE TO THE GOVERNMENT OVER A YEAR AGO NOW IT NEEDS TO BE GOT ON WITH IT'S THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY TO SIGNAL TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD THE U.K. IS UP AND RUNNING FOR BUSINESS AND HE'S GOING TO ENCOURAGE MAJOR INVESTMENT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO I WOULD URGE THAT DECISION TO BE MADE WELL IT CAN BE NOW MADE IMMEDIATELY BY THE NEW PRIME MINISTER
H. S. TWO IS MOVING AHEAD AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE AHEAD IT'S ANOTHER ANOTHER GOOD WAY OF DEMONSTRATING TO OUTSIDE INVESTORS THAT THE U.K. IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS SO JOHN OMELETTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE
# BEEN THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL THEATRE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND HARDEST JOBS IN THE ARTS A JOB THAT RUFUS NORRIS HAS DONE FOR JUST OVER A YEAR HE'S HAD TO FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL SIR NICHOLAS HYTNER AND DEAL WITH COLLEAGUES CRITICS AND THE BRICKBATS COME WITH SO HIGH PROFILE A ROLE BUT BOX OFFICE SALES ARE AT A SEVEN YEAR HIGH AND THERE HAVE BEEN HIT SHOWS AS WELL AS SOME MISSES OUR ARTS EDITOR WILL GUMPERT NOW REPORTS
WE'RE NOW GOING BACKSTAGE THERE'S A WOODWORK SHOP THEN THERE'S METALWORK
WE'RE GOING PAST WARDROBE A LONG ROOM WITH LOTS OF CUTTING TABLES AND A LOT OF WARDROBES
SURE WITH THE BIGGEST THEATRICAL EMPLOYER IN THE COUNTRY FOR A GUY LIKE YOU WITH US
EXCELLED AS A DIRECTIVE IT'S NEVER BEEN A MANAGING DIRECTOR HOW IS IT BECOMING A BOSUN TO UP A LITTLE
PRETTY FRIGHTENING REALLY A MINUTES IT THE MAIN THING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY AROUND YOU'RE BRILLIANT AND THEN THE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY AROUND THEM ARE BRILLIANT ON YOU GO WITH THIS ONE AS WELL
IT WAS A BIT
IT'S REALLY SQUEEZING INTO IT EVERYWHERE O.K.
THE RUFUS NORRIS HE STARTED THIS JOB IT IN APRIL TWENTY FIFTEEN I THINK THE THINGS THAT I'VE LEARNT IN THE LAST FOURTEEN
I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN TOLD GROW LEATHER SKIN QUICK IN THE RELENTLESS NATURE OF THE STEEPLECHASE THAT IS THIS
THE REALISATION THAT THE CRITICISM FROM OUTSIDE AND SOMETIMES FROM INSIDE
HE'S GOING TO BE CONSTANT AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO START GETTING USED TO AND SEEING AS PART OF THE
RIGHT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS I SUPPOSE EIGHTY ROPES GOING DOWN TWENTY THIRTY METRES TO THE STAGE FLOOR AND THEY'RE ALL ATTACHED THE LIGHTING
SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS THE OLIVIER THEATRE DURING THE LATTER STAGES OF THE SET UP FOR THE THREE CHEKOV PLACE WAS GOING TO BE PLAYING OVER THERE
TWENTY FIVE SHOWS A YEAR AND IT'S MASSIVELY IMPORTANT THAT THEY'RE AS GOOD AS THEY CAN BE BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THEY APPEAL TO AS BROAD AN AUDIENCE AS POSS
WE CALLED A NATIONAL THEATRE SO WE SHOULD BE SPEAKING TO THEM
IS YOUR STARTING POINT THAT IT CURRENTLY ISN'T MY STARTING POINT IS THAT IT COULD BE MORE
I'M INHERITING THIS ORGANISATION HAD A HEIGHT
THE AUDIENCE FIGURES ARE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC FOUR POINT THREE MILLION
BUT OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS FURTHER TO GO IS THERE A RISK IF YOU'RE GOING TO SHIFT NATIONAL THEATRES
THAT YOU COULD LOSE YOUR CORE AUDIENCE THAT WOULD BE A RISK IF ONE WERE FOOLHARDY THE CLASSICS WILL ALWAYS REMAIN THE SPINE OF OUR WORK
I THINK THERE MAY BE MORE PRODUCTIONS IN THE FUTURE THAT THAT CORDY
WANT TO GIVE A WIDE BERTH TO CENTRE WE'VE HAD A COUPLE RECENTLY BUT THE FACT THAT THEY WERE PACKED OUT MEANS SADISTIC THIS SKILL BECOMES ABOUT BALLET
IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE DO YOU FIND IT ALL
BIG CORPORATE BANKING BRANDS FOR EXAMPLE SUPPORTING AND ACTUALLY MAYBE IN YOUR HEART OF HEARTS YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT ON
I THINK INEVITABLY WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THAT AGAIN
I THINK IT COMES WITH THE JOB WE DO SEVERAL BIG FUNDRAISING EVENTS AND I WAS OUT ONE OF THEM SEVERAL YEARS AGO
NICK HYTNER WAS FRONTING IT UP I'M ON MY TABLE WERE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO TO MY KNOWLEDGE NEVER WENT TO THE THEATRE AND WERE BEHAVING IN A WAY THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE MY CHILDREN AT HOME AND
THE CONTRIBUTION THAT THOSE PEOPLE ON THAT NIGHT WERE MAKING TO IT IN THAT END
A SHOW LIKE LONDON ROAD ALL OF THESE BANKERS ON THAT OCCASION ON MY TABLE IT WAS AND THEY KISS
I WAS SITTING THERE CRITICISING THEM AND FEELING SLIGHTLY HOLIER THAN NOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS NOW I DO AND ACTUALLY IT WAS A VERY SIMPLE MOMENT AND NOW I WELCOME IT BECAUSE
LEARNING DEPARTMENT DOES FANTASTIC WORK DID DIVERSITY THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MOMENT DOESN'T COME FOR NOTHING WHAT'S BEEN THE LOWEST MOMENT WHAT'S BEEN THE MEMORIES WHAT WHAT ON EARTH DID I TAKE THIS
I MEAN ON A PERSONAL LEVEL THERE'S BEEN A FEW MOMENTS WHERE I'VE THOUGHT I CAN'T DO IT WHILST ON JUST NOT VERY GOOD BUT CERTAINLY THE LOWEST MOMENT WAS I THINK THE PRAXIS
BECAUSE IT REALLY EXPOSED HOW MUCH WORK THERE IS TO DO TO REALLY MAKE MAKE THIS COUNTRY JOINED
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO THE NATIONAL THEATRE
THE FACT IS IT COULD HAVE SERIOUS FINANCIAL WITH QUESTIONS
FIRST JOB AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IS TO EDUCATE OURSELVES AND TRY AND FIND OUT WHY IT IS THAT ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE NATIONAL THEATRE ARE ENTIRELY DISREGARDED BY HALF THE POPULATION
OR SEEN AS IRRELEVANT OR NOT SPEAKING FOR HIM TO GO I THINK I'VE GOT A GREAT JOB
IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS THE NATIONAL THEATRE IS AN INTERNATIONAL BRAND AND WE'RE ONLY GOING TO INCREASE THAT
# OUR ARTS EDITOR WILL GONE PUT SPEAKING TO RUFUS NORRIS AT THE NATIONAL THEATRE THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES TO NINE HELICOPTERS WILL HOVER OVERHEAD THE PHOTOGRAPHERS WILL JOSTLE REPORTERS WILL WRESTLE TO CAPTURE THE MOMENT WHEN POWER TRANSFERS FROM DAVID CAMERON TO HIS SUCCESSOR THERESA MAY
WHAT THEY WILL BE HAPPENING BEHIND THAT BLACK DOOR AND INSIDE BUCKINGHAM PALACE AS FIRST THE CIVIL SERVICE AND THEN HER MAJESTY BID FAREWELL TO ONE PRIME MINISTER AND GREET THE NEW ON PETER HUNT OUR ROYAL CORRESPONDENT CAN TAKE US THROUGH THE CHOREOGRAPHY OF THE MORNING PETER
GOOD MORNING THIS ON PAPER IS OF THE QUEEN'S ONE KEY POWER TO APPOINT A PRIME MINISTER OBVIOUSLY IT SEVERELY LIMITED BY CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION SO WHAT WE'LL SEE IS DAVID CAMERON FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF WINSTON CHURCHILL HER FIRST PRIME MINISTER HE BACK IN FIFTY FIVE LEFT DOWNING STREET PUFFING AS YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED ON A CIGAR WEARING A FROCK COAT AND TOP HAT AND A BOW TIE I MEAN MY CAMERA WON'T BE SIMILE DRESS BUT HE'LL MAKE A SIMILAR JOURNEY TO THAT ONE IN FIFTY FIVE REMEMBER
THE QUEEN'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER HAD FOUGHT IN THE BOER WAR DURING VICTORIA'S REIGN HE'LL GET TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE THE QUEEN THEN WILL BE THE ONLY WITNESS AS SHE HAS BEEN SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY TWO ON THESE MOMENTS FOR THE LAST ACT OF A PRIME MINISTER AS MISTER CAMERON TENDERED HIS RESIGNATION
AND THEN NICK WILL BE WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT WE WILL NOT HAVE A PRIME MINISTER FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT PERIOD AS WELL THERESA MAY TRAVELS UP THE MALL BEFORE THE FIRST OF POTENTIALLY MANY PRIME MINISTERIAL ENCOUNTERS WITH THE MONARCH SHE WILL MEET THE QUEEN THE QUEEN WILL SAY I LOVE YOU
IN A POSITION TO FORM A GOVERNMENT SHE'S OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT TERESA MAY SOMEONE WHO COMMANDS THE CONFIDENCE OF THE HOUSE OF THE COMMONS THERESA MAY ALSO YES AND AT THAT MOMENT SHE BECOMES PRIME MINISTER OF COURSE SHE LOOKS FORWARD TO MANY POTENTIAL ENCOUNTERS WITH THE MONARCH AS I SAY AND IN THE PAST THE QUEEN HAS TALKED ABOUT THESE WEEKLY AUDIENCES AND SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER
UNBURDEN THEMSELVES LOTS OF UNBURDENING FOR MISTER CAMERON PERHAPS TO DO LORD STUART WOULD REMEMBERS WELL WHAT IT IS LIKE THE TRAUMA OF THE EMOTION TO LEAVE DOWNING STREET FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS ADVISOR TO GORDON BROWN
MISTER CAMERON WAS THE ONE DRIVING UP DOWNING STREET TO TAKE OVER AND GORDON BROWN AND HIS TEAM WERE LEAVING AND HE JOINS US HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TROY NEXT I SAY TRAUMA IS THAT HOW IT FEELS WHEN YOU'RE INSIDE YEAH IT DOES FEEL A TRAUMA A LITTLE BIT LIKE A GRIEF THERE ARE THREE THINGS GOING AT ONCE ON A DAY LIKE TODAY ONE IS WITH THE THE THINGS YOU SEE IN PUBLIC THE CEREMONY THE GOODBYES DOWNING STREET OUTSIDE THE NUMBER NUMBER TEN DOOR THE PROCESSION TO THE PALACE THE SECOND HIS PEOPLE INSIDE
QUITE EMOTIONAL SAYING GOODBYE NICKING MINE OR BITS OF MEMORABILIA IN MY CASE WHICH I'D NEVER ADMIT IN PUBLIC AND WHAT DID YOU STILL WHERE WE OUGHT TO BE TOLD POSSIBLY COMMENT AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS THE CIVIL SERVANTS WHO ARE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE POLITICAL STAFFERS
ARE ALSO SAYING THEIR GOODBYES BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE FURTIVELY RUNNING AROUND PREPARING FOR THE QUICK TRANSITION TO YOU MISSUS MAY'S TAKEN AND ALL THAT'S GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME IN A VERY AND THE WORLD IS WATCHING IN AND OFTEN INSIDE NUMBER TEN WEEK WE SPENT THAT DAY JUST SITTING WATCHING THE WORLD WATCHING US WATCHING THE T.V. SCREEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER TEXTING YOU ARE LOTS OF OTHER JEWELLERS LIKE ME TAKES A YOU ANOTHER SAY WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE WAS NO BIT OF INFORMATION WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE NUMBER TEN THE WAS TOO TRIVIAL THAT DAY TO BE PUT ON AARON I THOUGHT ONE POINT
THERE'D BE ABOUT OUR RUNNING ON SKYE SAYING OR AND B. BE SEEN FATS HER SAYING GORDON BROWN I'M PEELS HIS FIFTH BANANA OF THE DAY BECAUSE IT WAS THAT LEVEL OF MINUTIAE OF DETAIL THAT YOU SEEM TO WANT NOW THE THE MANAGER WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HEARD IS WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE LETTER BECAUSE EVERY OUTGOING PRIME MINISTER WRITES A LETTER TO THEIR SUCCESS OR IS IT MORE THAN SIMPLY SAYING GOOD LUCK
I THINK YOU SPEAK FOR GORDON GORDON A VERY HEARTFELT LETTER ABOUT THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING HOPING THAT KAREN WOULD APPRECIATE THAT SURE I'M SURE I'M SURE HE DOES ABOUT THE FAMILY HOPING THAT THE FAMILY BE WILL BE COMFORTABLE THERE AND BE HAPPY THERE AND LEAVING HIM A BOTTLE I THINK IT WAS ONE OF WHISKY ALONGSIDE THE LETTER SO I'M SURE WILL DO SOMETHING WE HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LETTER BECAUSE IT'S A COLLEAGUE OF HIS TAKING OVER
BUT IT'S A MOMENT TO BE SINCERE AND HEARTFELT I THINK YOU MENTIONED THE FAMILY WHAT MAKES IT EMOTIONAL FOR DAVID CAMERON TODAY WHAT MADE IT EMOTIONAL FOR GORDON BROWN IS IT'S NOT JUST YOU LEAVING YOUR OFFICE YOU'RE LEAVING YOUR FAMILY HOME YOU'RE SAYING TO YOUR CHILDREN WE'VE GOT TO GO NOW KIDS THAT'S IT NO MORE PLAYING IN THAT GARDEN NO MORE YOUR BEDROOM YOU'RE UP YOU'RE OUT AND NO MORE GOING BACK TO AT ANY POINT THAT'S IT THAT'S IT IT'S IT'S A BRUTALITY I THINK THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND ANYWHERE ELSE IN POLITICS
IT IS IT IS TRAUMATIC IT'S TRAUMATIC FOR THE FAMILY IT'S TRAUMATIC FOR THE ADVISERS AND I THINK THERE IS A MIXTURE OF DELIGHT AND EMPTINESS THAT COMES IN THE DAYS AFTERWARDS WHEN THE PHONE STOPS RINGING YOU TOLD ME ON THE DAY THAT WE WERE LEAVING THEY PREPARED FOR THE PHONE TO STOP RINGING AND IT DID
AND YOU JUST HAVE TO BE READY FOR THAT I SHOULD THANKS NOT CALLING MY LAWYER YES I APOLOGISE I SHOULDN'T SHE YOU STILL FEEL THE EMOTION OF IT NOW YOU'RE AN OPPONENT OF DAVID CAMOGIE DISAGREE WITH HIM FUNDAMENTALLY ON EUROPE BUT AT THE HUMAN LEVEL DO YOU FEEL FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY TODAY WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM I DO PARTLY COS OF THE ABRUPTNESS OF THE N. PARTLY BECAUSE WORKING IN NUMBER TEN WHATEVER YOUR POLITICAL AFFILIATION IS NOT JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY PRIVILEGE AND HONOUR BUT
YOU THINK WHEN YOU WORK AT NUMBER TEN THE PHONE CAN RING AT ANY POINT AND WHEN IT RINGS YOU'LL HAVE TO DROP EVERYTHING AND THAT THOUGHT IS WITH YOU TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY FOR HOWEVER LONG YOU'RE THEREFORE IN OUR CASE IT WAS THREE YEARS AND HIS TEAM'S CASE IT WAS LONGER AND WHEN THAT GOES THERE'S RELIEF BUT THERE'S ALSO A DEEP SENSE OF LOSS AND IT MIGHT SOUND IT MIGHT SOUND TRIVIAL COMPARED TO THE KINDS OF LOSS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE AND PROBABLY IS BUT IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF GETTING A LOT A LOT OF ADJUSTMENT AND NOT BEING AT THE CENTRE OF THINGS I THINK THAT DAVID CAMERON WILL BE
WILL BE TOUGH I SUSPECT YOU ADJUST TO IT PRETTY WELL BUT I THINK FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS IT WILL BE QUITE TOUGH NOTHING REALLY PREPARES YOU FOR THAT LOSS OF OFFICE I THINK STUART WOULD MOULD WOULD THINK YOU JOIN IT ALTHOUGH COUNSELLING FROM NICK ROBINSON IS AVAILABLE THAT'S ALL FROM US SARAH NELSON AND MATTHEW PRICE OUR EDITORS GOOD MORNING
