# IT IS JUST COMING UP TO SIX MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A FIRST LOOK AT THE WEATHER ALEX DEAKIN IS AT THE B.B.C. WEATHER CENTRE THIS MORNING HE LIKES HELLO THERE JUSTIN GOOD MORNING A WET START FOR MANY OF THIS MORNING TURNING A BIT BRIGHTER AND DRIER AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY AND FOR MANY IT SHOULD BE A FINE FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING THE FORECAST FOR TODAY SPLITS INTO THREE AREAS I'LL START WITH SOUTH EAST ENGLAND
A BRIGHT START IN SOME PLACES BUT OVERALL QUITE A LOT OF CLOUD THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE MORNING A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS DRIFTING BUYER TO DURING THE MORNING BUT THEY'LL TEND TO FADE OUT SPIRAEA EARLY AFTERNOON AND THEN GRADUALLY SKIES WILL BRIGHTEN UP DURING THE AFTERNOON TO REVEAL SOME SUNNY SPELLS BY LATE AFTERNOON AND THROUGH THE EVENING TEMPERATURES TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY THREE CELSIUS MAYBE TWENTY FOUR CELSIUS THAT'S SEVENTY FIVE FAHRENHEIT
ON TO SOUTH WEST ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS WALES NORTHWEST ENGLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND
A DULL START HERE WITH RAIN AND DRIZZLE IT MANY PLACES QUITE BREEZY TOO BUT THE RAIN WILL FIZZLE OUT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS THE WINDS WILL GRADUALLY EASE FROM MID MORNING ONWARDS WE SHOULD SEE SKY STARTED TO BRIGHTON WITH SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING PRETTY QUITE PLEASANT TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWO DEGREES CELSIUS JUST THE SMALL CHANCE OF ONE OR TWO ISOLATED SHOWERS BUT MOST WILL AVOID THOSE AND HAVE A DRY END TO THE DAY
ON TO NORTH EAST ENGLAND AND ALL OF SCOTLAND CLOUDY AND WET HERE AT THE MOMENT THE RAIN IS HEAVY IN PLACES AS WELL THE RAIN SHOULD AGAIN HE IS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS AND STEADILY SKIES WILL BRIGHTEN FROM MID MORNING TO REVEAL A MIXTURE OF SUNNY SPELLS AND A SPRINKLING OF SHOWERS DURING THE AFTERNOON THE SHOWERS THERE WILL BE WELL SCATTERED MANY WILL AVOID THEM AND STAY DRY BUT WHEN THEY DO OCCUR THEY COULD BE ON THE HEAVY SIDE EQUIPE STREET THE MOMENTS THE WINDS THE WINDS GRADUALLY EASING TEMPERATURES SIXTEEN TO MAYBE TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS
# THAT'S THE FORECAST THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ALEX IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THE MORNING'S PAPERS ALL HAVE THEIR PICTURE ALL THE HEADLINE OF THE WHICH SUM UP THE FACT THAT BRITAIN IS TO HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER WHO WILL BE A WOMAN WHO'LL BE THE NEW MAGGIE THAT'S THE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY MAIL WHAT IS STRIKING THOUGH IS HOW PAPERS THAT NORMALLY DISAGREE ARE AGREED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN THEIR VIEW IT HAS TO BE THERESA MAY AND NOT ANDREA LETS THEM SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LABOUR'S ABORTING DAILY MIRROR
HAS THE HEADLINE BE AFRAID BE VERY AFRAID MAGGIE TOO IT SAYS WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE ORIGINAL MARGARET THATCHER OF COURSE AND ALONGSIDE HER ANDREA LEAD SOME WHOM THE PAPER DUBS A TORY EXTREMISTS AND SAYS IN AS IS IN A SURGE TO BECOME THE U.K.'S SECOND FEMALE PRIME MINISTER INSIDE THEY DESCRIBE HER OR THEY GET WHAT M. P. ANONYMOUSLY DESCRIBE AS UKIP
IN A SKIRT BUT WHAT IS STRIKING TURN TO THE NORMALLY TORY SUPPORTIVE COURSE SUN NEWSPAPER IT'S HEADLINED THE IRON MAY THE WORDS MAIDEN THERESA MAY EAT GIVES YOU TEN REASONS WHY IT'S IN THE WORDS OF PAPER MUST BE TERESA AND TEN REASONS IT CAN'T BRING ANDREA RANGING FROM EXPERIENCE TRUST TEX AND TRACK RECORD AND SO ON THE HEADLINE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAPER THE SUN LEADING OBVIOUS
THE FABULOUS GOING TO BE A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO WOMEN IS OF COURSE THE FRONT PAGE NEWS AND DISCUSSION EM LOTS OF THE PAPERS INCLUDING THE GUARDIAN WHICH POINTS OUT THAT NO PARTIES EVER CHOSEN BETWEEN TWO WOMEN FOR LEDA AND PERKINS THAT GUARDIAN COLUMNIST ON THE FRONT PAGE SAYS THERE'S THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY THIS IS AN ENTIRELY UNPRECEDENTED TURN OF EVENTS THAT ONE
IS THE FIRST BUT SECOND BECAUSE NO PARTIES HAVE HAD CHOSEN BETWEEN TWO WOMEN FOR LEADER LET ALONE PRIME MINISTER AND THERE IS A P.H.D. THESIS TO BE WRITTEN ON WHY THE PARTY OF TRADITION CAN MAKE SPACE FOR WOMEN WHILE U.K. WIDE PARTIES OF THE CENTRE AND THE LEFT EXCEPT THE GREENS STILL HAVE NOT ELECTED A FEMALE LEADER LET ALONE A FEMALE PRIME MINISTER
# THE GUARDIAN ALSO HAS ON ITS FRONT PAGE A SORT OF DAY TWO STORY REALLY ON THE CHILCOTT REPORT YOU S. BLUNDERS IN IRAQ LED TO THE RISE OF ISIS SAYS HAMMOND THAT'S QUOTING THE FOREIGN SECRETARY OF COURSE WHO CLAIMED THAT THE MOVES BY PAUL BREMMER THE AMERICAN IN CHARGE OF RUNNING A RAG AFTER THE INVASION TO DISMANTLE THE IRAQI ARMY HAD PROVED TO BE DISASTROUS MISTAKE THE BLAME BEING PUT ON THAT RATHER THAN THE DECISION TO BACK THE WAR WHICH OF COURSE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY DID EVEN THERE WAS TONY BLAIR'S LABOUR PARTY WHO ARE IN GOVERNMENT
# TREATING PETS WITH HOMEOPATHY IS UNETHICAL POTENTIALLY DEADLY AND SHOULD BE BANNED ACCORDING TO QUITE A FEW VETS THE STORY IN THE DAILY MAIL AND OTHER PAPERS AS WELL MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND VETS VETERINARY NURSES SCIENTIST ANIMAL LOVERS HAVE WRITTEN TO THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF VETERINARY SURGEONS URGING THE REGULATED TO BLACKLIST
HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES HOMEOPATHY IS PRACTISED BY FIFTY FULLY QUALIFIED VETERINARY SURGEONS IN THE U.K. OR OFTEN OFFERED TREATMENT APPARENTLY CORE ALONGSIDE THE CONVENTIONAL ONES
THE DISCIPLINE CLAIMS TO PREVENT AND TREAT DISEASES BY USING DILUTED FORMS OF PLANTS AND HERBS MUCH THE SAME THING AS THEY DO WITH HUMANS BUT SCIENTISTS ARGUE THAT THE KIDS ARE SO DILUTED BUT THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY REALLY PROVIDE REAL CARE AND OF COURSE THAT DIFFICULTY WITH ANIMALS IS THAT THERE CAN'T BE MUCH OF A PLACEBO EFFECT WAS I DON'T KNOW THEY GET IN THERE
# NOW HE'S ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX A SHOOT OUT ADDS A PROTEST ABOUT POLICE VIOLENCE IN DALLAS HAS ENDED WITH FOUR POLICE OFFICERS DEAD AND MORE INJURED AND WE'VE BEEN HERE IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES WELL THAT A SUSPECT HAS NOW BEEN ARRESTED
THERE WERE VIGILS TAKING PLACE IN CITIES ACROSS AMERICA LAST NIGHT FOR THE TWO BLACK MEN SHOT DEAD IN RECENT DAYS BY POLICE OFFICERS ALTON STERLING IN BATON ROUGE AND FOR CASTILLE IN MINNEAPOLIS THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE THE SHOTS WERE FIRED IN DALLAS TEXAS AND HE'S REALLY INTO THE TEAM THIS IS NOW
THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE IN DALLAS LAST NIGHT JUST HOURS BEFORE THAT BARACK OBAMA SAID THEY WERE BIASES IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT HAD TO BE ROOTED OUT AND RACISM SHOULD BE A CONCERN FOR ALL AMERICANS WHEN INCIDENTS LIKE THIS
THERE'S A BIG CHUNK OF OUR FELLOW SAID US ASSUMING THAT FEELS AS IF
BECAUSE THE COLOUR OF THEIR SKIN THEY ARE NOW BEING TREATED THE SAME AND THAT HERDS AND THAT'S YOUR TROUBLE ALL OF US THIS IS NOT JUST A BLACK ISSUE IT'S NOT JUST SAID SPANA GIVES YOU THIS IS AN AMERICAN ISSUE THERE WE SHOULD ALL CARE ABOUT OR FAIR MINDED PEOPLE
SHOULD BE CONSERVED ALSO SOME PRETTY BLUNT SPEAKING FROM THE GOVERNOR MARK DAYTON IN IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA WHO THIS IS WHERE MANY HAPLESS WEAR ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS TOOK PLACE WHO SAID HE DIDN'T THINK THAT A POLICE OFFICER WOULD HAVE SHOT AND KILLED A DRIVER WHO WAS PULLED OVER FOR A BROKEN REALISED IF THE DRIVER HAD BEEN WHITE WITH US HAVE HAPPENED IF THOSE PASSENGERS WAIT I DON'T THINK
SO I'M FORCED TO CONFRONT AND I THINK ALL OF US IN A SORT OF OUR SINGLE RENT THIS IN THIS KIND OF
RACISM EXISTS AND THE OTHER SON COME ON UP ON ALL OF US DON'T BOTHER WERE GOING TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO SEE THAT SO DOESN'T HAPPEN YOU CONTINUE TO HAPPEN
# ONE THIS DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME WILL HE LIVE OF COURSE ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN DALLAS SIX THIRTEEN REMEMBER FEARS OVER THE CLOSURE OF THE STEELWORKS IN PORT TALBOT WELL IT MAY BE PUT ON HOLD TO TODAY THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAJID JAVID IS IN MUMBAI FOR TALKS WITH THE OWNERS ARE NOT JUST BOUGHT TALBOT BUT PLANTS RATHER ROTHERHAM STOCKBRIDGE AND HARTLEY PULL AS WELL YOU GITA THE MAYA IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN MUMBAI MORNING TO YOU GEEZER WHAT WHY THE EXPECTATION THE TARTARE MAY NOW CHANGE THEM
WELL THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE STEER BOARD IS MEETING AFTER THE U.K. VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT
VOTE HAS HAD BIG IMPLICATIONS FOR DATA WHICH HAS FACTORIES NOT JUST IN THE U.K. BUT IN EUROPE IN THE NETHERLANDS AS WELL NOW A QUARTER OF THE STEEL THE TARTAR PRODUCERS IN THE U.K. IS SOLD TO EUROPE SO IT'S A CLEAN MARKET AND WHAT KIND OF ACCESS THE COMPANY WILL NOW
TO DAD MARKET WILL OBVIOUSLY BE A BIG CONCERN OBVIOUSLY NOT JUST THE DATA BUT ALSO FOR ANYONE WHO POTENTIALLY WANTS TO BUY THE BUSINESS AND SO UNTIL THERE IS SOME CLARITY UNTIL THEY ARE ABLE TO ASSESS WHAT THE LORD REALLY MEANS FOR BUSINESSES THEY'RE EXPECTED TO A HALT
THIS IS THE ONGOING PROCESS EXCEPT FOR THE PLANTS IN HARTLEPOOL RATHER ROOM AND STOCKSBRIDGE NOW BUSINESS SECRETARY SUCH A JOB IT IS EXPECTED TO MEET POTTER CHAIRMAN CYRUS MYSTERY TODAY
HE'S BEEN HERE EVERY SINGLE TIME THE TARTARS HOW THE BOARD MEETING AFTER THE ANNOUNCED IN MARCH THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BE SELLING ITS BRITISH OPERATIONS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED VARIOUS INCENTIVES SINCE THEN ONE OF THEIR BEING STICKING POINTS FOR ANY DEAL TO BE STRUCK WAS THE PENSION LIABILITY WHICH RUNS INTO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS
AFTER THE LAST BOARD MEETING HERE INLAND BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAD OPEN A CONSULTATION IN PARLIAMENT ON CHANGES TO THEIR PENSION LAW SO KEEPING IN MIND THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WAS ALL BRITISH GOTTEN STANCE HAS SEEN MORE A COMEDY TIVE ALSO THE GLOBAL PRICE OF STEEL
HAS BEEN RISING DATA DOES SEEM A LITTLE BIT IN LESS OF A HIGH WE NOW HAD TO SELL THE BUSINESS THEN THEY WERE IN MARCH AND BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD WE ARE EXPECTING AN ANNOUNCEMENT CONFIRMATION OF THAT STORY LATER TODAY
WHILE THE BOARD MEETING IS DUE TO START IN ABOUT AN HOUR FROM NOW AND WE ARE TOLD THAT YOU CAN GO ON TILL THE EVENING WE ARE EXPECTING AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO BE MADE AFTER THAT THE CARTER HAS ALWAYS BEEN FULL OF SURPRISES THE LAST TIME WE WERE EXPECTING A SHORTLIST OF BIDDERS TO BE ANNOUNCED THEY DIDN'T DO THAT SO WE WOULD REALLY ONLY CERTAINLY NO ONCE THE MEETING IS OVER THIS
# IF YOU TELL THEM I THINK YOU'RE VERY MUCH SIXTY MINUTES PAST SIX BEEN TWO WEEKS NOW SINCE BRITAIN WOKE UP TO A FUTURE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ONE REASON REGION THAT THE UNION ARE VERY DECISIVE BOOT WAS SUNDERLAND AND KATIE PRESCOTT IS THIS MORNING FOR A BUSINESS NEWS LOOKING AT THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND SUNDERLAND AND THE REASONS PERHAPS BEHIND THAT DECISION MORNING KATIE
GOOD MORNING JUSTIN YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FAR FROM WHERE I'M STANDING ON THE WATERFRONT IN THE HEART OF SUNDERLAND TO FIND SIGNS OF ITS INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE LOOKING ACROSS THE WATER HERE THE CITY'S GLASS SCENT AS A MONUMENT TO THAT RICH HISTORY
THE SUNDERLAND THAT ONCE BUILT SHIPS THAT SAILED ON EVERY SEA HE'S REBUILT A NEW INDUSTRY FROM THE SKILLS OF THOSE DECIMATED SHIPYARDS CARS THE THIRTY YEAR OLD NISSAN FACTORY HERE EMPLOYS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DIRECTLY THROUGH THE MANY BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SPRUNG UP AROUND IT THE MUSEUM DOWN THE WATER FOR HOURS EVEN LAUNCHING AN EXHIBITION DEDICATED TO IT
BUT OVER HALF OF ITS CARS AND INDEED MOST OF THE GOODS PRODUCED HERE IN THE NORTH EAST SOLD TO THE E.U. AND WITH SO MANY JOBS DEPENDANT ON EUROPE IT MIGHT SEEM ODD THAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN RESONATED SO STRONGLY HERE BUT THERE WERE OTHER ECONOMIC REASONS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE SIXTY ONE PER CENT OF THEM WANTED OUT
OF WATER COS THE REAR THE CALL
AND YOU KNOW IT JUST IT'S JUST EVERYTHING ALL THERE WAS IN THE STREET WHERE YOU LIVE
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S MORE PEOPLE GET ME AND ARD TIME
I MEAN WHEN I WAS WELL AND I WASN'T EVEN IN THE DEN THERE WAS JOBS HE WOULD NOW AS I SEE OTHERS
JUST
USED AROUND UP WE WERE SISTER I WISH I'D BROUGHT IT IN THE PALE BORING
JUST EVERYTHING I WISH I'D TOOK ME TIME ABATED AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT
OPEN TO BACK THE ONLY SMALL LITTLE COUNTRY AND I DON'T SEE WHY
THE MAFIA BUT WERE YOU WORRIED AT ALL ABOUT JOBS GOING FROM THE AREA LISTEN I DON'T THINK
THEY'VE GOT A BIG PLANT OF THE WASHING
I'M NOT PREJUDICED
THAT SHOULD BE THE LOLLIES PEOPLE ME TOO MANY FOREIGNERS
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER THAN WHAT I WANT
I DON'T MIND DO YOU LESS MONEY OR ANYTHING
TOO MANY SPRAY
IN THE HEART OF SUNDERLAND NEXT TO THE STATE MUSEUM IN WINTER GARDENS IS THE SUNDERLAND SOFTWARE CENTRE FUNDED MY E. GRANTS IT HOUSES SOME OF THE CITY'S RENOWNED TECHNOLOGY COMPANY
ADAM HILL IS THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF CONSULT IN DESIGN
IT'S REALLY I'VE BEEN RACKING MY BRAINS TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND HOW IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED I THINK HE WAS A BIG SHOCK FOR US BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THAT IT'S BEEN A BIG WAKE UP CALL BUT ACROSS THE NORTH EAST REGION THAT ACTUALLY THINGS WERE NOT QUITE AS EVERYONE AS EVERYONE EXPECTED IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE'VE HAD THAT WE'VE GOT
YOUR BUSINESS DEALS A LOT WITH
YOU CONTRACT SO HOW DO YOU FEEL FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THE REFERENDUM RESULT FROM FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE WE'VE LOST WE HAVEN'T LOST THE CONTRACT YET BUT ONCE THE ONCE THAT ONCE WE LEAVE THE E.U. THEN WE WEREN'T AND THOSE CONTRACTS ARE UP THEN WITH THEY WON'T BE RENEWED WE KNOW THAT ALREADY IT'S A BIG A BIG CHANGE IT'S CAN HAPPEN I'M SITTING HERE IN THIS GLEAMING NEW BUILDING FUNDED BY THE E.U. IT MUST FEEL SLIGHTLY STRANGE FOR YOU THAT SUNDERLAND VOTED OUT WERE YOU SURPRISED
YOU COULD MAYBE UNDERSTAND HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT THE OTHER WAY YOU KNOW HOW HOW PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT A BIG SOCCER US AND WONDERED HOW THEY'RE GOING TO EAT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE WORRIED ABOUT ARE YOU GOING TO EAT BUT FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE IT DOES SEEM A BIT AS A SENSE VERY DISAPPOINT
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO GALVANISE VOICES BUSINESS VOICES IN THE LOCAL AREA IF WE JUST SIT BACK AND LET THINGS HAPPEN IT WILL ONCE AGAIN BE CONTROLLED BY WHATEVER M.P.S IN LONDON IN WESTMINSTER DECIDE FOR US AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE BUSINESSES IN THE REGION AND PARTICULARLY FOR US AND SOME
OR OUT ALL BUSINESSES NOW I WANT TO SAY IN WHAT HAPPENS NEXT TO WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IT'S A PRINTING MACHINE
EVEN MCDOWELL RUNS PREDATORY PRESS WHICH MAKES MACHINES THAT PRINT
BISCUIT TINS AND BOTTLE TOPS HE AND MOST OF HIS HUNDRED STRONG WORKFORCE VOTED
EXCITED BY WHAT HE BELIEVED
OPPORTUNITY
IT'S UP TO US NOW TO TAKE THIS AND HAVE THE SERIOUS ABOUT
IF WE DO THIS THE FUTURE WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT
THE BETTER ECONOMIES
MORE ADVENTUROUS MORE
LOOK AT THIS AND START
YES WE'RE OUT OF EUROPEAN COMMUNITY THIS PRIVATE FEELS STRONG LINKS WITH THEM STILL BUT HOWEVER
STANDING HERE BY THE SIDE OF THE WAY WITH ME AND SEAGULLS CIRCLE OVERHEAD AS YOU CAN PROBABLY HEAR IT'S JAMES RAMSBOTTOM WHO IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE NORTH EAST ENGLAND CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE JAMES THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING HERE WE ARE IN A PLACE THAT SO ENTWINED WITH EUROPE IT'S WE'VE GOT THE LARGEST TRADE SURPLUS IN ENGLAND
AND EVEN THE PORTS IN THE NORTH EAST SYMBOLICALLY FACED TOWARDS EUROPE
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT DIDN'T RESONATE WITH VOTERS I DON'T THINK THAT THE MESSAGES THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN TRIED TO GET THROUGH ABOUT THE ECONOMY REACHED PEOPLE WHO FUNDAMENTALLY FELT DISENGAGED FROM THE ECONOMY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THE REASONS THEY FELT DISENGAGED I THINK ARE MANY AND VARIED BUT I THINK REALLY THAT THAT WHOLE SORT OF BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS DID NOT GET THROUGH
IS THERE A SENSE THAT IN THE LOCAL PSYCHE HERE THERE'S A FEELING THAT ECONOMIC PROSPERITY HASN'T REACHED THE REGION DO YOU THINK THAT'S CORRECT I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S CORRECT I THINK THE NORTH EAST HAS HUGE POTENTIAL INDEED A MANTRA IS OFTEN THAT
THE NORTH EAST IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO SOLVE IT'S AN ASSET THAT SHOULD BE MAXIMISED BUT I THINK OUR POLITICIANS FOR TOO LONG HAVE TRIED TO PLAY THE GAME OF TALKING THE REGION DOWN AS A WAY OF ENCOURAGING MORE FUNDING TO THE REGION RATHER THAN WHAT WE WOULD DO IS JUST SAY WHAT GREAT BUSINESS WE'VE GOT HERE AND WE REALLY DO HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE BUSINESSES YOU'VE SPOKEN ABOUT YOU'VE TALKED PREVIOUSLY TO OTHER BUSINESSES HERE YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE RANGE AND THE WAY THAT THIS REGION HAS REINVENTED ITSELF WE'VE GOT HUGE STRENGTHS
YOU MENTION THIS AUNT LET'S TALK ABOUT IT IT'S OBVIOUSLY A HUGE EMPLOYER IN THE REGION DIRECTLY BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES THAT WORTH ALONG ITS SUPPLY CHAIN
THE FACTORY THE COMPANY HASN'T SAID THAT IT'S LEAVING THE NORTH EAST FAR FROM IT SAYS IT'S MONITORING THE SITUATION
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT BELIEVING THE REGION RIGHT NOW IT IS ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE CAR PLANT IN THE WHOLE OF THE WORLD IT'S A FANTASTIC BUSINESS HUGE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN MADE THERE AND IT'S MAKING SOME OF THE BEST MODELS GOING BUT I THINK THEY WILL BE CONCERNED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK EXTRA HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT NEW MODELS IN THE FUTURE COME HERE AND WE AS A REGIONAL ECONOMY REALLY NEED TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ENSURE THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THAT
IT STRIKES ME FROM SPEAKING TO A LOT OF THE BUSINESSES HERE THAT WHAT'S REALLY
THE DIFFICULTY IS THE SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY AND WHILE POLITICIANS COULDN'T QUIT
MUDDLE AROUND OVER WHO'S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE BUSINESSES JUST HAVE TO SORT OF KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON YES AND I THINK THAT WHAT YOU SEE NOW IN THE NORTH EAST IS A REGION THAT HAS REALLY ADAPTED TO CHANGE IN THE PAST THIS WAS THE AREA OF SHIPBUILDING WE'VE REINVENTED BEYOND THAT BUT I THINK WE'RE NOW FACING ANOTHER HUGE PERIOD OF CHANGE THEIR BUSINESSES HERE A GREAT BUSINESSES IN SO MANY WAYS BUT CHANGE IS HARD WORK AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY PULL TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE CHAMBER WITH THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU WERE QUICK TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT ECONOMIC PROSPERITY STAYS IN THE NORTH EAST WE'RE TRYING TO BRING AS MUCH STRENGTH TO THAT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND PARTICULARLY HELPING THEM TO REACH OUT TO OTHER MARKETS ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT FORTY NINE PER CENT OF EXPORTS HERE GO TO EUROPE WE'VE GOT TO FIND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IN THE YEARS AHEAD
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL LET'S HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT THE MARKETS SITTING ALONE IN A LONDON STUDIO IS RICHARD DUNBAR HIS INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT GOOD MORNING RICHARD MORNING
LISTENING TO A REPORT FROM SUNDERLAND IS THIS A MICROCOSM OF WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM BUSINESS AROUND THE COUNTRY
I THINK IT IS IN A SENSE YOUR BUSINESSES WERE MOSTLY SHOCKED BY THE RESULT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO BUT AS WE'VE HEARD IN BOTH THOSE REPORTS ARE JUST GETTING ON WITH IT SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE AS THEY SEE IT AND THEY'RE GETTING ON WITH DOING BUSINESS IN DO MORE BUSINESS OR IN MANY CASES ARE DOING LESS BUSINESS FOR EXPECTING TO DO LESS BUSINESS FROM A MARKET PERSPECTIVE OF THE PAST
YOU COUPLE OF WEEKS HAS BEEN MUCH AS CHAINS ALSO THE PINES WEAKER THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE STOCK MARKET THAT ARE MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE U.K. A LOT WEAKER BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE WE'VE HAD CONSIDERABLE POLICY RESPONSES BOTH ON THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND FROM THE TREASURY TO TRY AND INJECT SOME SOME GROWTH BACK INTO THE ECONOMY IN AN ECONOMY THAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY SLOWLY OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS
WE'VE SEEN THE FIRST PUBLICATION OF A CONSUMER CONFIDENCE SURVEY THIS MORNING THE FIRST ONE THAT LOOKS CONFIDENT SINCE BRICKS IT UNSURPRISINGLY CONFIDENCE IS DOWN
YES THAT'S NOT NOT A SURPRISE I THINK INVESTORS WILL BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT BOTH THIS A SURVEY AND THE SURVEYS THAT WILL FOLLOW IT OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS TO TRY AND GAUGE WHAT BUSINESSES ARE THINKING WHAT CONSUMERS ARE THINKING SOME SOME BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS ARE
VERY AFFECTED BY THE VOTE OF TWO WEEKS AGO OTHERS A LITTLE AFFECTED OR NOT AFFECTED AT ALL I TRY TO GET THE AGGREGATE OF THAT AND TRY AND WORK OUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE IS CAUSING SOME HEAD SCRATCHING AMONGST ECONOMISTS AND ONCE INVESTORS IN GENERAL AND THESE SURVEYS OF THE NEXT PERIOD WILL GIVE US SOME CLUE AS TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON AN ECONOMY
# LOOKING AT ATTEMPTS TO KEEP PEOPLE CARMEN WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF BUSINESS SECRETARY SAGEDE JAVED'S TRIP TO INDIA TODAY
WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THE TRIP A TWOFOLD FIRSTLY TO TALK TO THE TARTARE BOARD THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'LL HAVE MET SINCE THE VOTE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND TO TRY AND START SOME BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS IN TERMS OF TRADE
I THINK OUR POLITICIANS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER FAIRLY QUICKLY AND I WE'LL HAVE TO GET THE PLANE JOURNEYS BOOKED FAIRLY QUICKLY TOUCHY KEPT THINGS MOVING BUSINESSES AS WE'VE HEARD ARE GETTING ON WITH IT EITHER DOING OR NOT DOING AND THE POLITICIANS WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE WISE AT ALSO GET ON WITH IT PRETTY QUICKLY I THINK
LET'S TRY AND FIND A SILVER LINING IT IT'S FRIDAY AFTER ALL WE GET U.S. S. JOB DATA LATER TODAY WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING FROM THAT WELL THEY DID IT ALL WE HAD A MONTH AGO IT WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTING AND OBVIOUSLY MUCH FOCUS CORRECTLY AND RIGHTLY ON THE BRAKES AT THOUGHT AMONGST INVESTORS GLOBALLY BUT THE END OF THE U.S. ECONOMY IS THE BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMY IN THE WORLD
THE PRICE OF MONEY THERE IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PRICE IN THE INVESTOR WORLD AND WE ARE EXPECTING THE U.S. COLLEGE HAVE OTHER JOBS OVER THE LAST MONTH WHICH SHOULD GIVE SOME EVIDENCE AT THE U.K. OR THE U.S. ECONOMY
HE'S GROWING IS CHUGGING ALONG REASONABLY SENSIBLY AND THAT WILL BE HELPFUL TO THE WHOLE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND INDEED OURSELVES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION AT THE U.S. ECONOMY IS GENERALLY A RISING TIDE THAT WILL LIFT MANY BOATS AND THERE ARE MANY THAT COULD DO WITH IT AT THE MOMENT
THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH RICHARD DUNBAR INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT

# THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS IN DALLAS TEXAS OVERNIGHT GUNFIRE FOR POLICE DEAD SEVERAL OTHERS INJURED SOME OF THEM SERIOUSLY AND ALL OF IT OF COURSE FOLLOWING THE KILLING BY POLICE OF TWO BLACK MEN IN SEPARATE INCIDENTS IN RECENT DAYS BOTH OF THEM APPARENTLY COMPLETELY UNWARRANTED NICK BRYANT IS A U.S. CORRESPONDENT JOINS US NOW LIME JUST BRING US UP TO DATE NECK WITH WHAT THE POLICE ARE SAYING ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED THEN INDEED WHAT IS HAPPENING IN DALLAS
DRESSED IN THE STREETS OF DOWNTOWN DALLAS WAS THRONG WITH PROTESTERS AND POLICE WENT DOZENS OF SHOTS RANG OUT THE GUNFIRE SCATTER THE CRAP PEOPLE RUNNING IN PANIC I'M SURE IT'S THERE WHERE THE SHOTS WERE COMING FROM THE DALLAS POLICE HAVE SAID THAT IT APPEARS THAT TWO SNIPERS OPEN FIRE AMBUSH STYLE AS THEY DESCRIBED IT FOR AN ELEVATOR POSITIONS SEVERAL OF THEIR POLICE OFFICERS WERE SHOT DEAD
WHAT THE SUSPECT HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AFTER A VERY VIOLENT SHOOT OUT WITH POLICE FOOTAGE OF MERGING OF THAT TAKEN ON PEOPLE SMARTPHONES PEOPLE ARE LOOKING DOWN ON THIS THIS GUNFIRE WHERE A LOT OF GUNFIRE WAS EXCHANGED A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE WAS FOUND NEARBY AND THAT'S BEEN SECURED BY THE DALLAS BOMB SQUAD EARLIER THE POLICE HAD SAID THE SUSPECT'S THREATENED TO PLACE A BOMB
IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA AND LITERALLY JUST AS YOU CAME TO BE JUSTIN THE DALLAS POLICE CHIEF IS JUST OUT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND SAID THAT THE POLICE ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH ANOTHER SUSPECT WHO IS APPARENTLY HOLED UP IN A GARAGE IN DOWNTOWN DALLAS AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS ACTUALLY SPEAKING NOW IT'S VERY CHAOTIC
IT'S A STILL FLUID SITUATION BUT THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN A RANDOM MULTIPLE SHOOTING POLICE OFFICERS HERE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY TARGETED AND DELIBERATELY TARGETED ONE ASSUMES BECAUSE OF THESE TWO SHOOTINGS I MENTION INTRODUCTION THERE WHERE WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE RECENTLY AND ABOUT WHICH THERE IS SUCH HUGE ANGER
THAT WOULD BE ONE THEORY IS THAT IT'S A KIND OF RETALIATION BUT THAT'S BY NO MEANS CLEAR WE SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW THE MOTIVE AT THE MOMENT THE POLICE HAVEN'T EVEN SPECULATED ABOUT THAT THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN ANY INDICATION IT'S ONLY THE PAST SORT OF A HALF HOUR OR SO THAT THEY MANAGED TO TAKE ONE OF THE SUSPECTS INTO CUSTODY AS I SAY ONLY THE LAST FEW MINUTES THEY'VE SAID THEY'RE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH ANOTHER ONE WE DON'T KNOW IDENTITY OF THE SUSPECTS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR MOTIVATIONS WOULD BE
BUT IT IS OBVIOUSLY AN INCREDIBLY SORT OF UPSETTING AND STRESSFUL DISTRESSING SITUATION MIGHT RAWLINGS WHO'S THE MAYOR OF THAT DALLAS AND SAID IT WAS ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED THERE THIS EVENING BECAUSE THE PROTESTERS STARTED IN A VERY SORT OF ANGRY WAY BUT NON VIOLENT WAY AND OBVIOUSLY IT TOOK THIS DRAMATIC AND HORRIFIC TOUR
# O.K. WELL I KNOW YOU'LL KEEP US UPDATED DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME NICK BRYANT FOR THE TIME BEING THANKS TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN THREE HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND THAT PROVIDE COMPLEX HOT CARE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO STOP DOMINIC WHO'S OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT CAN TELL US MORE DOMINIC WHO'S WHO'S DOING THE STOPPING AND WHY ARE THEY DOING IT HELLO
HELLO DOMINIC CAN YOU HEAR US YES I CAN I DON'T WANT TO JUST TELL US MORE ABOUT WHO IS STOPPING THESE HOSPITALS CARRYING ON WITH COMPLEX HEART SURGERY AND TREATMENT AND WHY THEY'RE DOING IT
SO THIS IS PROPOSALS BY N.H.S. ENGLAND FOR NEW TREATMENT FOR ALL PATIENTS YOUNG AND OLD WHO SUFFER FROM CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE SO THIS ISN'T PEOPLE WHO NEED A HEART BYPASS
IN THE MID SIXTIES FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS PEOPLE WHO ARE BORN WITH HEART PROBLEMS AND THAT AFFECTS AROUND NINE OUT OF EVERY ONE THOUSAND BABIES BORN IN THE U.K. AND IT FOLLOWS WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THE PUBLICATION OF A VERY DAMNING REPORT INTO HIGH DEATH RATES AMONG BABIES WHO UNDERWENT CARDIAC SURGERY AT BRISTOL ROYAL INFIRMARY THAT LAUNCHED
PRETTY MUCH A FIFTEEN YEAR DEBATE BETWEEN FAMILIES AND SURGEONS AND HOSPITAL MANAGERS AND N.H.S. MANAGERS OVER HOW AND WHERE TO RUN SERVICES
SO N.H.S. ENGLAND HAS COME UP WITH THESE PROPOSALS WHICH INVOLVE REMOVING SPECIALIST SURGERY IS HIGHLY COMPLEX BEDROOM IS EXTREMELY VULNERABLE PATIENTS FROM CENTRAL MANCHESTER
LESTER AND THE ROYAL BROMPTON IN LONDON AT THAT SURGERY WILL BE MOVED ELSEWHERE THERE IS ALSO AN ISSUE AROUND WHAT THEY CALL SPECIALIST MEDICAL CARE SIR THAT'S FOR EXAMPLE
CENTRES WHERE DOCTORS MAY CLOSE A HOLE IN THE HEART OR WIDEN SOMEONE'S ARTERIES BUT HE'S ALSO GOING TO CEASE IN BLACKPOOL SOUTH MANCHESTER PAPWORTH NOTTINGHAM AND IMPERIAL COLLEGE IN LONDON THIS IS PART OF A PATTERN WE'VE SEEN ACROSS COUNTRIES AND WE SAW IT WITH STROKE WHERE CONTROVERSIAL THOUGH IT IS THERE WAS A MOVE TO SPECIALISE TO MOVE TO A MORE SPECIALIST CENTRES TO CLOSE OTHER CENTRES AND IT WAS CLAIMED THAT TREATMENT WAS THEREFORE MUCH BETTER AND THE DEATH RATE FOR LOWER AND YET LOCAL PEOPLE OFTEN OBJECT TO THESE THINGS
THEY DO I MEAN THE LOGIC BEHIND THIS HE SAY IS THAT THESE CENTRES HAVE TO BE BIG ENOUGH TO ALLOW SURGEONS TO CARRY OUT THESE COMPLEX OPERATIONS ON A REGULAR BASIS SO THERE SO THEY'RE GOOD AT THEM AND THE EVIDENCE DOES SUPPORT THAT TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS RECEIVE WHAT N.H.S. ENGLAND CALLED SUSTAINABLE HIGH QUALITY CARE BUT
A PLAN WAS LAUNCHED SOME YEARS AGO THREE YEARS AGO IT COLLAPSED IN THE FACE OF A LEGAL CHALLENGE N.H.S. IN THEM WERE TOLD TO GO AWAY AND START ALL OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THERE WAS HUGE SHOUT CRY FROM PATIENT GROUPS AND FROM THE INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS WHICH WERE TOLD AT THAT TIME
THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE SERVICES AND I THINK WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE VERY SIMILAR TREATMENT THIS TIME ROUND WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM YOUR BOSS AT THE ROYAL BROMPTON HE SAYS THIS IS AN IRRATIONAL AND RECKLESS DECISION DESCRIBED IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY
TOMMY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL BE HEARING FROM ALL SIDES HOSPITAL FROM PATIENTS AND FROM THE N.H.S. ENGLAND AUTHORITIES AS WELL LATER IN THE PROGRAMME TIMES TWENTY TO SEVEN BARACK OBAMA AND DAVID CAMERON MEET TODAY AT THE NATO SUMMIT IN WARSAW LEAST TO SET OUR CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT IS THEIR LAST ONE FOR BOTH OF THEM
# CERTAINLY LAST ONE FOR BOTH OF THE MAYOR WORLD VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE THAT BARACK OBAMA HEAD THOUGHT HE WOULD SEE WHEN HE ENDED HIS TIME AS PRESIDENT REMEMBER THAT WHEN HE BEGAN HE SAID THAT HE WOULD GET AMERICA OUT OF WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN NOW SEEM TO BE LIKE FOREVER WARS HE TALKED ABOUT TAKE MOVING AWAY FROM A CONCENTRATION ON THE DEFENCE OF EUROPE
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING A NEW BRIGADE HERE TO PROTECT THE POOR BALTIC STATES HERE AT THIS HOUR NATO SUMMIT AND OF COURSE IT IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST TIME THAT HE HAS SEEN DAVID CAMERON FACE TO FACE SINCE THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHERE THE TALK OF THE ITEM NOT OFFICIALLY ON THE AGENDA
EXIT WILL BE A POINT OF DISCUSSION HERE AND YOU MENTIONED THE BEEFING UP OF NATO'S PRESENCE IN EASTERN EUROPE WHAT WHAT IS BRITAIN'S ROLE IN THAT GOING TO BE
BRITAIN HAS ALREADY COMMITTED TO PROVIDING TROOPS TO BE PART OF THIS NEW ALLIANCE THIS NEW BRIGADE ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE THAT THOSE COMMITMENTS WERE MADE BEFORE ANY DECISION WAS TAKEN ON WHETHER TO REMAIN OR TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I THINK ONE OF THE MESSAGES THAT DAVID CAMERON WILL WANT TO MAKE HERE IS THAT BRITAIN STILL REMAINS A MEMBER OF THE NATO ALLIANCE STILL VERY MUCH HE'S A PLAYER AT THE TABLE
THE BRITISH ARE TRYING TO DOWNPLAY THIS TO SAY THAT PAX IT'S NOT GOING TO BE UP PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS BUT TO EVERYONE ELSE YOU TALKED YOU SAID IT WILL BE TO USE THE PHRASE THAT'S BEING WIDELY USED TO CLICHE BUT IT'S A WENT THAT USING THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM BUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IN WHAT SENSE BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATE ORGANISATIONS AND EVERYONE'S MADE IT PERFECTLY PLAIN THAT BRITAIN REMAINS COMMITTED TO TO NATO WHAT WHAT'S THE FEAR OR INDEED IS THERE A FAIR AMONG OTHER NATO COUNTRIES THAT SOMEHOW WE ARE GOING TO BE PULLING BACK FROM NATO AS WELL AS THE
THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE ALIGNED TO SIR GOING TO OPERATE FOR EXAMPLE BRITAIN WAS ALWAYS KNOWN TO BE ONE OF THE TOUGHEST VOICE WITH THE WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION CALLING FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA OR SOME AMERICAN OFFICIALS WERE SAYING BEFORE THE SUMMIT GETS UNDERWAY WE HOPE THAT THE SAINTS TO GET RUSSIA WILL BE MAINTAINED THAT THERE WON'T BE A WOBBLE WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW THAT BRITAIN'S STRONG VOICE SEEMS TO BE ON ON THE WAY OUT
THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT DEFENCE SPENDING THIS IS ONE OF THE MESSAGES THAT BARACK OBAMA WILL BRING HE'S BEEN SAYING REPEATEDLY THAT AMERICA CANNOT BEAR THE ENTIRE BUT IT BRANCH EUROPEAN NATIONS TO INCREASE SPENDING ON DEFENCE THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT BRITAIN'S PRIORITIES GOING FORWARD WHAT KIND OF SPENDING THERE WILL BE
BRITAIN WILL WANT TO SEE THAT THERE IS THERE IS NO CONCERN BUT IF ANYTHING IS IS CHIC AND OF COURSE IT DOES IT DOES CREATE QUESTIONS ALL DOWN THE LINE THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO SAY BUT IT IS THE SAME BUT OF COURSE WE ARE LOOKING INTO A DIFFERENT WORLD MY THANKS
# IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN TAKE A LONG LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS NOW SEVERAL OF THEM USE THEIR FRONT PAGES TO BRING MARGARET THATCHER INTO THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST WHICH IS THE DAILY MAIL AS A BATTLE BETWEEN TWO WOMEN WHO WANT TO FILL HER SHOES AND SOME BELIEVED THAT ONLY THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY CAN FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THE IRON LADY THE PAPER SAYS HER RIVAL THE ENERGY MINISTER ANDREA LEAD SOME WOULD BE A HUGE GAMBLE AS PRIME MINISTER AND ADDS THAT SHE'D BEEN UNCONVINCING DURING QUESTIONING ABOUT CLAIMS SHE MADE ON HER C.V.
THE SON TAKES THE VIEW THAT ALTHOUGH MISSUS MAY WANTED BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. WHERE'S MISSUS LED SOME CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE PAPER TRUST THE HOME SECRETARY TO DELIVER ON BRICKS THE GUARDIAN SAYS MISSUS LETTERMAN'S REGARDED AS STRAIGHT TALKING AND SHE MADE A CLEAR PITCH YESTERDAY TO RIGHT WING TORIES BY CRITICISING GAY MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AND STATING THAT SHE WOULD REPEAL THE BAN ON FOX HUNTING IT SAYS ONE REASON WHY SHE COULD BEAT MISSUS MEZ BECAUSE SHE'S A CONFIDENT MEDIA PERFORMER AS A HOME SECRETARY HE'S COMPETENT
RATHER THAN CHUMMY AND TIME SAYS THAT ANDREA LED TO MAS SURGE FROM OBSCURITY TO ENTER A CONTEST WITH MISSUS MAY WHO IT IS NOW FACES A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS CHALLENGE BUT THE PAPER CONSIDERS THE HOME SECRETARY TO BE THE FAR STRONGER CANDIDATES AND URGES TORY MEMBERS NOT TO CHOOSE IDEOLOGY OVER CAPABILITY OR DAILY MIRROR URGES ITS READERS TO BE AFRAID VERY AFRAID OF MISSUS LED SOME PAPER DESCRIBES AS MAGGIE TO THE MIRROR IS CONCERNED BECAUSE WHAT THE VOCALS HURT HOSTILITY TO GAY MARRIAGE AND REPUGNANT SUPPORT FOR FOX HUNT
# THE SUN SAYS IN THE PAST TEN DAYS AROUND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE JOINED THE LABOUR PARTY CALL INTO THE PAPER THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE WHOLE TORY PARTY AND HALF OF THOSE WHO JOINTED SO TO KEEP JEREMY CORBIN AS LABOUR LEADER FOLLOWING THE REVOLT AGAINST HIM BY HIS M.P.S AND I'LL GO FOR THE GUARDIAN MY CORBIN WRITES THAT HIS PARTY'S PRIORITY MUST NOW BE TO MOBILISE WHEN HE CALLS AN ASTONISHING NEW FORCE IN BRITISH POLITICS MORE THAN HALF A MILLION MEMBERS NOW YOU KNOW THIS IS THE QUESTION YOU'VE BEEN ASKING ALL WEEK
# HE'S TARZAN GAY DOES HE SWING BOTH WAYS THAT'S THE QUESTION POSED BY THE TIMES THE PAPER ALSO BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF THE NEW LEGEND OF TARZAN FILM WHICH HAS FEATURED A GAY KISS BETWEEN THE HERO OF THE JUNGLE AND A BELGIAN SOLDIER THE SCENE WAS CUT FROM THE FINAL EDIT BECAUSE SAYS THE TIMES
# PERPLEXED AUDIENCE THE TIMES CALLED AND SUDDENLY MEN HEADLINE THIS MORNING'S THE FOUR POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND SEVERAL WOUNDED IN DALLAS TEXAS AFTER SNIPERS OPENED FIRE AT A PROTEST ABOUT THE FATAL SHOOTING OF TWO BLACK MEN BY POLICE IN THE UNITED STATES
# IT WASN'T THE SNAPPY EST OF TITLES WHEN A GROUP OF M.P.S QUESTION THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND YESTERDAY THEY CALLED THE SESSION FOREIGN POLICY DEVELOPMENTS JULY TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN A CLASSIC BRITISH UNDERSTATEMENT BUT AT LEAST AS A CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN REPORTS THEY DID HAVE AN AWFUL LOT TO TALK ABOUT
EARLIER THIS WEEK WHEN THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CROSS EXAMINED THE SO CALLED MINISTER FOR BRECHT'S IT OLIVER LETWIN THE M.P.S ACCUSED MINISTERS OF A DERELICTION OF DUTY FOR NOT HAVING ANY BACK UP PLANS FOR A U.K. DEPARTURE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE CRISPIN BLUNT RETURN TO THE SUBJECT WITH PHILIP HAMMOND WHY WAS NO CONVINCING FLOWING
I'M NOT SURE THAT I SEE THE NEED AND THE DECISION HAS BEEN MADE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED OVER A TIME SCALE THAT RUNS INTO YEARS
MY BLUNT SAID THE COMMITTEE HAD WARNED THE FOREIGN OFFICE BACK IN APRIL THAT IT WOULD FACE CHALLENGES FOLLOWING A VOTE AND YOU'RE THE OFFICE THIS WERE SAT THERE WITH THEIR POLITICAL INSTRUCTION
TO DO NOTHING PREPARED ME FOR ACTIONS CHAIRMAN THROUGHOUT THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
DREW ATTENTION AS TO OTHERS IN THE CAMPAIGN TO LIKELY CONSEQUENCES OF HER LEAVE THEIR VOTE
AND THE REACTION THAT I HEARD WAS THAT THIS WAS A SCAM
I THINK IF WE HAD SOUGHT TO ENGAGE DEPARTMENTS OF STATE IN PREPARING
EVIDENCE OF THE LIKELY CONSEQUENCES OF A LEAF VOTE THAT INFORMATION HAD FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS AN UNWARRANTED INTERVENTION IN THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN
PHILIP HAMMOND SAID THE U.K. WASN'T READY TO START HAVING FORMAL TALKS ABOUT LEAVING THE E. U. I DON'T THINK THAT AT THE MOMENT
FOR VARIOUS REASONS NOT LEAST OF WHICH WE DON'T HAVE THE NEW PRIME MINISTER IN POST
THE MOMENT WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO BEGIN SUBSTANTIVE NEGOTIATIONS IMMEDIATELY
THIS WEEK THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT CITIZENS OF E.U. COUNTRIES WHO ARE LIVING AND WORKING IN THE U.K. WILL BE ALLOWED TO STAY HERE THE FOREIGN SECRETARY STRESSED THE NEED TO GET A DEAL PROTECTING U.K. CITIZENS LIVING IN OTHER E.U. MEMBER STATES AND SAID IF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TOOK A UNILATERAL DECISION THAT COULD UNDERMINE LATER NEGOTIATIONS AN ARGUMENT THERE DIDN'T GO DOWN WELL WITH THE S. N. PEAS STEPHEN GETHIN'S
SOUNDS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORK REMEMBER PEOPLE MADE THE RICE THEY HAVE FAMILIES
BUT THAT'S PART OF YOUR NEGOTIATING PROCESS I VOTED REMAIN SO THE DIVE IT'S A DESI FOR INSECT BUT I THINK I FIRST POINT I FEEL LIKE I WANTED IT I WANTED TO CONTINUE
THOSE RIGHTS THAT THE FACT IS YOU SAYING THEIR RIGHTS AS HARD AT THE NEGOTIATE SO WHAT I'M SAYING THE FACT IS SO LONG AS WE WERE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
THOSE RIGHTS ARE GUARANTEED ASAL
BY THE TERMS OF OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS WE CEASED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN
THE RIGHTS OF OUR CITIZENS AND THE CITIZENS OF OTHER COUNTRIES TO LIFT TO WORK TO ESTABLISH
TO INVEST IN BUSINESSES TO OWN PROPERTY WE'LL ALL HAVE TO BE AGREED AND I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE AGREED ON A. FULLY RECIPROCAL
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS SAID THERE CAN BE NO INFORMAL TALKS ABOUT THE U.K. LEAVING THE Y. YOU UNTIL THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TRIGGERS ARTICLE FIFTY WHICH WILL START A TWO YEAR WITHDRAWAL PROCESS PHILIP HAMMOND SAID HE'D BE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS NOW IF THE BUREAUCRATS IN BRUSSELS WOULD SAY TODAY
WE ARE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND TALK
TO THE U.K. GOVERNMENT ABOUT A DEAL BUT THE SHAWS THEIR MUTUAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS IN EACH OTHER'S COUNTRIES I'M SURE THE U.K. WOULD BE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS
LABOUR'S MIKE GAPES SAID IT WASN'T BRUSSELS BUREAUCRATS WHO ROUND THE EUROPEAN UNION IT WAS THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION YOUR PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY WITH THE MEMBER STATES
WHO ARE QUITE RIGHTLY VERY
ABOUT THE DECISION THAT PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY TOOK THE FOREIGN SECRETARY DISAGREED I DON'T DETECT ANGER
AMONG COLLEAGUES THAT I SPEAK TO IN THE MEMBER STATES I DETECT DISAPPOINTMENT
AND BEWILDERMENT FRANKLY IN SOME PLACES WHERE I DO SENSE
HE'S IN THE INSTITUTIONS IN BRUSSELS WHERE PEOPLE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY'RE
THEIR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE I'VE BEEN SERIOUSLY THIS RAY
AND HE SAID POLITICIANS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WERE MUCH MORE SYMPATHETIC THAN E.U. OFFICIALS TO THE POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES BRITISH MINISTERS NOW FOUND THEMSELVES IN HAVE YOU GOT IT SEAN CURRENT REPORTING THERE IT'S TEN TO SEVEN
# NOW WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA OF SNIFFER DOGS USING THEIR NOSES TO DETECT DRUGS EXPLOSIVES OR SMUGGLED FOOD NOW THOUGH SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING TO CREATE SNIFFER RODENTS MICE AND RATS DOCTOR PAUL FINE STEIN IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
DOGS LIKE MICE LIKE YOUR MEN'S DETECT ODOURS USING BRA DETECTOR SHEEP IN THERE KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACT IN A CERTAIN VOTERS THOUSANDS A BIT FROM TIME THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS TO ABLE TO DETECT THEM BUT THEY'RE NOT TUNE GET ANY WINE ODOUR SO KIND OF ANIMALS SO WE TRIED TO CREATE MORE ANIMALS THAT I NEVER LIKED DOGS
WITH SLIGHTLY SPECIAL ATTRIBUTE WE ARE THEIR WORK SEAN TO PAY ATTENTION TO ONE ORDER SO THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT INSTEAD OF TRAINING SAY A DOG YOU'RE BREEDING A RODENT THAT EMERGES ALREADY WITH A NOSE SENSITISED TO DRUGS OR EXPLOSIVES OR WHATEVER
THAT'S CORRECT YOU HAVE SUMMED IT UP PERFECTLY AND WHAT IS IT YOU'RE HAVING TO DO TO THE ANIMAL IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO COMMON AND D.N.A. TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS THEN WET IT WERE ABLE TO GENETIC ELEMENTS TO THE MOUSE GENOME AND AS SUCH WERE ABLE TO MODIFY THE GENETIC STRUCTURE OF A MOUSE AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE TAKING
A RECEPTOR GENE SOMETHING IS ONLY EXPRESSED IN THE NOSE OF THE OR ANIMAL WE MODIFIED HOWARD GETS SELECTED FOR EXPRESSION
SO THAT INSTEAD OF BEING RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED IN THE NOSE WE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF CELL BUT NO STRESS THERE JEAN QUITE CONSIDERABLY AND HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO TELL THAT IT'S WORKING IF YOU LIGHT WELL THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS TO DEFINE WORKING ONE WORRY A DEFINING WORK HE IS
WE CAN LITERALLY PEER INTO THE NOSE AT THE MOUSE BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE NEW CELLS SO WE CAN SIMPLY ASK DID WE CHANGE THE NUMBER OF CELLS THAT ARE MARKED IN THE NOSE MORE COMPLEX WAY WHICH I THINK IS WHERE ARE YOU GOING OUT IS WE SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE WE COULD EITHER
LIES THE BRAIN IN REAL TIME TO SEE IF THEIR BRAINS WERE MORE ACTIVE IN THE PRESENCE OF OLDER IN THE SECOND WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST EXCITING PART OF THE RESEARCH IS WEARY TEST THE ANIMALS' BEHAVIOUR EARLY TO SEE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO DETECT LOWER DOSES DANNY NORMAL ANIMAL WORK
AND IN BOTH CASES WE WE FOUND THOSE RESULTS SO IN THEORY IN THE FUTURE BORDER CONTROL OR MINE CONTROL THEY COULD CARRY WITH THEM MICE OR RATS IN THE HOPE THEY'D HELP GUIDE THEM TO THINGS THAT EITHER HUMANS WANT TO AVOID OR WANT TO DETECT THAT'S CORRECT WELL IT'S FASCINATING TO WORK WITH MY MATES VERY EASY DID YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT HAVE DRIED RED SO THAT'S EASY DOGS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GENETICALLY MODIFY NOT POSSIBLE SO
CURRENTLY WE HAVE THE SYSTEM SET UP IN MICE AND WERE TRYING TO TRANSLATE INTO RAD SOME PERHAPS ONE DAY WILL BE ABLE DO AND DOGS WHICH WERE ACTIVELY WORKING ON RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY RATS ARE BEING USED IN AFRICA TO SEEK OUT AND THE MIND FIELDS THERE ARE FOR LANDMINES
# WELL I DIDN'T KNOW THAT DID YOU SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN WE NEED MORE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH GOOD TECHNICAL SKILLS SO SAYS THE GOVERNMENT AND THEY'RE PLANNING AN OVERHAUL OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION BUT OF COURSE THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME SUCH A CRY AS BEEN HEARD OR INDEED SUCH AN OVERHAUL UNDERGONE LORD SAINSBURY'S HERE DAVID CENTURY LABOUR PAIR WHO CHAIRED AN EXPERT PANEL ON TECHNICAL EDUCATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT MORNING TO YOU ALL AND AT THIS TIME IS SOMETHING THAT A CHANGE REALLY PROFOUNDLY
I THINK SO BECAUSE AS YOU'VE SAID WE'VE WE'VE HAD AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS
ALSO THIS IN FACT I THINK OVER THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS THERE'S BEEN TWENTY EIGHT ACTS OF PARLIAMENT ON EFFIE TECHNICAL EDUCATION
BUT PEOPLE HAVE NOT REALLY TAKEN A SERIOUS LOOK AT IT CERTAINLY NOT GONE AND WHAT WE DID WHICH WAS TO GO AND LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE GOOD TECHNICAL EDUCATION SYSTEM I JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT WHERE WE TALK WE CAN LEARN FROM THEM THESE ARE CHOICES SO PEOPLE GO UP TO G.C.S.E. AND THEN THE CHOICES THAT THEY MAKE AFTER IT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE CHOICES THAT ALONG A TECHNICAL LINE OUGHT TO BE CLEARER AND MORE OF IT
MEAN WE WE HAVE TOTALLY CHAOTIC SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE A YOUNG PERSON WILL BE FACED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIRTEEN THOUSAND QUALIFICATIONS THEY'RE NOT OF VALUE IT'S NOT KNOWN WHETHER THEY REALLY ARE THE ONES THAT EMPLOYERS WANT
TODAY ONE EXAMPLE IF YOU THINKING YOU WANT TO BE A PLUMBER THERE ARE THIRTY THREE DIFFERENT QUALIFICATIONS YOU CAN TAPE NO ONE KNOWS WHICH OF THOSE ONES OF GOOD ONES AND ABOVE ALL ONES WHICH WORK IN THE MARKET PLACE SO IF YOU TAKE THAT QUALIFICATION AND YOU GO TO AN EMPLOYER
THE EMPLOYER WILL SAY WELL I'LL TAKE YOU RATHER THAN SOMEONE WHO HASN'T GOT THE QUALIFICATION AND WHEREAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF COURSE IS A. LEVELS AND A DEGREE LEVEL EVERYONE NOW SO WHEN I LOOKED ABROAD AT WHAT HE'S DONE BETTER WHAT IS THE MODEL THAT WE SHOULD BE FOLLOWING IT
ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE A NATIONAL SYSTEM OF QUALIFICATIONS WHICH IS LAID DOWN
BY THE GOVERNMENT WITH CLEAR ROOTS PROBABLY FIFTEEN TWENTY ROUTES AND THAT SAYS IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A PLUMBER OR YOU WANT TO GO
TO SOCIAL CARE OR YOU WANT TO BE AN ENGINEER THIS IS THE ROUTE YOU TAKE MY SPACE INSIDE TO IT AS WELL THAT MATTERS
WELL I THOUGHT I DON'T THINK IT'S STATUS PEOPLE JUDGE OF THESE THINGS ON THE RESULTS PEOPLE
WANT TO THAT THE LEVELS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IF YOU GET A LEVEL THAT'S WHAT GETS YOU INTO UNIVERSITY AND WE'VE GOT INTO UNIVERSITY YOU GET THAT THAT GETS A BETTER JOB AND BETTER PAY YOU CAN'T SAY THAT
OF OUR QUALIFICATIONS TO DE BRIEF ONE ABOUT LABOUR BECAUSE YOU ARE LABOUR BACK AND THUNDER ARE YOU INTERESTED IN FINDING A NEW PARTY IF IT WERE TO SPLIT FROM LABOUR
I THOUGHT I'VE DONE THAT ONCE I I THINK IT'S A YOUNG MAN WITH THE PAY OF COURSE YEAH I THINK THAT YOUNG MAN'S GAME AND IT WASN'T HUGELY SUCCESSFUL THE LAST TIME WE
# PERHAPS IT WAS A PRELUDE TO TONY BLAIR COMING IN BUT BUT YOUR MONEY'S NOT GONNA BE INVOLVED THIS TIME ROUND IF LABOUR DECIDE I THINK IT'S A YOUNG MAN'S GAME TO DO THAT SORT OF THING LORD SAINSBURY NICE TALK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND LET US TURN TO THE WEATHER HAS ALEX TAKEN THEY SWIM AT CHAIR JUSTIN GOOD MORNING WET START TO THE DAY FOR MANY BUT THINGS WILL BRIGHTEN UP AND DRY UP THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE MORNING AND FOR MANY IT WILL BE A FINE AFTERNOON AND EVENING THE FORECAST FOR TODAY SPLITS INTO THREE START WITH SOUTH EAST ENGLAND

# THOMAS MORGAN REPORTING THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN HAD BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY NIGHT OF VIOLENCE IN DALLAS TEXAS SNIPERS WE WERE HEARING IN THE NEWS OPENING FIRE ON THE POLICE FOR POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED SEVEN ARBOURS
HAVE BEEN WOUNDED TWO SUSPECTS ARE SAID TO BE IN CUSTODY AND ALL OF THAT HAPPENING DURING A DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE FATAL SHOOTINGS IN RECENT DAYS OF TWO BLACK MEN SAIT PRESENTS EVENTS THAT SEPARATE SIDES OF THE COUNTRY BY WHITE POLICE OFFICERS THE ORGANISER OF THE BLACK LIVES MATTER RALLY THE REFERENCE CHEF HOOD HAS BEEN TELLING THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS WHAT HE SAW AS THOSE SHOTS WERE FIRED I WAS LEAN APPROACH
I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH ANOTHER OFFICER I HEARD WAS SOUNDED BY SIXTY
IS A SCRAMBLE OF TOWARDS THE SHIRES OUR OWN AWAY FROM IT'S TRYING TO GET PEOPLE ON THE STREET
RED OR MYSELF TO SAVE OUR SHOW WE MANAGED TO GET THROUGH TO BOB WHELAN WHO IS FREELANCE JOURNALIST BASED IN DALLAS THAT TIME IN DALLAS'S MOSES WHAT TEN PAST ONE OR SO IN THE MORNING AND BOB CAN WE START WITH WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING NOW WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE POLICE OPERATION
WHICH IS RIGHT AT THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN BUT THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH HIM AND ALSO HAVE BEEN TRADING GUNSHOT TO THE OTHER TWO SUSPECTS IN CUSTODY ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN RELIEVED HE WAS THE SO CALLED PERSON OF INTEREST WHO
SO EITHER A LOT OF PROTESTERS STILL CRAP
AND WHAT ARE THE POLICE SAYING ABOUT THE OFFICERS WHO WERE INJURED BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE FOUR DEAD BUT QUITE A FEW MORE HAVE HAVE BEEN SHOT
THE POLICING AND THE THING ABOUT POTENTIAL MOTIVES BUT WAS TO BE WITH NOBODY MAKING A MANIFESTO OR A DECLARATION PUBLIC TO BE STEMMING FROM THE
BUT BUT OBVIOUSLY EM THOSE TWO SHOOTINGS THAT YOU REFER TO WHERE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROTESTS WEREN'T THERE THAT WAS IT WAS GOING ON
BUT THAT PROTEST WAS ENTIRELY PEACEFUL AND PRESUMABLY THE PLACE WERE POLICING IT PERFECTLY NORMAL
PRESUMABLY THEN I MEAN WHAT THE POLICE ARE LOOKING AT IS IT'S SOMEONE OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO'D DECIDED FOR WHATEVER REASON WHETHER OR NOT THEIR MOTIVES TURN OUT TO BE CONNECTED ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THOSE TWO DEATHS AT YOU REFER TO THOSE TWO SHOOTINGS YOU REFERRED TO THE SOMEONE WHO CAME IN AND DECIDED TO USE THIS OCCASION TO DO WHAT THEY DID YES THAT'S THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO AND THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE THIS MARCH WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY FOLLOWING
WHOEVER PLANNED OR PARTICIPATED THEY HAD TO WORK VERY QUICKLY TO BE WELDED TO THE FAR END TO BE SET UP AND READY FOR THE POLICE AS THEY CAME BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPRESSED ASLEEP BOB WILL AND JOURNALIST BASED IN DALLAS IN A PUDDING FOR US LIKE SOMETIMES THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# SEVEN FOURTEEN GIVE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THEIR CHOICE IN THEY'LL USUALLY WANT TO BE TREATED IN THEIR NEAREST THE LOCAL HOSPITAL THE STAFF WHO TREAT THEM WILL ALMOST ALWAYS AGREE BUT IF YOU GIVE MEDICAL EXPERTS THE CHOICE THEY WERE MORE LIKELY ARGUE THE CARE WILL NOT JUST BE OF HIGHER QUALITY BUT BE SAFER TO IF IT'S PROVIDED IN A SPECIALIST CENTRE ALBEIT ONE THAT MAYBE SOME DISTANCE AWAY THE QUESTION OF WHO SHOULD MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER A HOSPITAL IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE COMPLEX SURGERY AND CARE IT'S PATIENTS NEED
HE'S RAISED BY THE DECISION OF N.H.S. ENGLAND TO STOP THREE HOSPITALS TREATING PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX HEART CONDITIONS WILL TALK TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OR ONE OF THOSE AFFECTED IN JUST A SECOND FIRST THOUGH HUGH PYM IS OR HEALTH EDITOR HUGH THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE SORTS OF DECISIONS WE SAW ON STROKE CARE IN WHICH THERE'S NO ATTEMPT TO CENTRALISED TO SPECIALISED TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES
YES YOU SUMMED IT UP WELL THERE MAKE THIS IS A BIG DEBATE IN THE N.H.S. IS IT BETTER FOR PATIENTS' OUTCOMES IF YOU CONCENTRATE SERVICES ON FEWER SPECIALIST AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE THE SURGEONS DOING THE MOST OPERATIONS OR TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES IN THAT FIELD SO YOU ACHIEVE A HIGHER STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE OR DO YOU STICK WITH YOUR EXISTING GEOGRAPHICAL SPREAD WHICH IS MAYBE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PATIENTS IN THE HOSPITAL
THAT ARE SPREAD FURTHER AFIELD WILL SAY THEY PROVIDE JUST AS GOOD A SERVICE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ARE TRYING TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE ON CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE SURGERY LARGELY AFFECTING CHILDREN WITH A HOLE IN HER HEART AND ANOTHER VERY COMPLEX CONDITIONS AS A RESULT OF AN ENQUIRY AT BRISTOL ROYAL INFIRMARY FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHICH EXPOSE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS SORT OF SURGERY WITH A BUNDLE HEALTH REVIEW GOT NOWHERE IT GOT BOGGED DOWN WITH LEGAL CHALLENGES
SO N.H.S. ENGLAND HAVE STARTED THE PROCESS AGAIN THEY SAID THEY'VE GONE OUT AND CONSULTED WIDELY THEY'VE CREATED CLINICAL STANDARDS AND SAID IF YOU MEET THE STANDARDS FOR EXAMPLE DOING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE OPERATIONS PER YEAR THEN YOU CAN CONTINUE DOING THE SURGERY IF YOU DON'T YOUR TRANSFER SERVICES SO INSTEAD AGAIN OF COURSE FORGIVE ME AND THERE IS THIS IS AN OBJECTIVE HURTLE ACROSS IT OR YOU DON'T IN THEORY IT IS NOT AS OBJECTIVE JUDGEMENT EXACTLY IN THE SAME WE'VE CREATED THE STANDARDS WE'VE CONSULTED WITH SURGEONS
WITH PATIENTS WITH HOSPITALS IN CREATING THE STANDARDS IT'S BEEN A VERY TRANSPARENT PROCESS IT'S NOT AN ARBITRARY PROCESS AND WILL IT MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR PATIENTS IN LEICESTER FOR EXAMPLE IF I HAVE TO GO TO BIRMINGHAM WILL IT MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IF THEY DON'T GO THE ROYAL BROMPTON BUT THEY GO TO TO GUY'S AND SAINT THOMAS'S INSTEAD BUT SOME OF THE HOSPITAL'S INVOLVED HAVE ALREADY
COME OUT AND SAID VERY STRONG WITH THIS IS IRRATIONAL AND EXTRAORDINARY UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS LEICESTER FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM SAY THEY ARE MEETING STANDARDS THEY HAD VERY GOOD OUTCOMES AND INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN THIS AREA YOU CAN THANK YOU LET'S INDEED HERE FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF LEICESTER'S N.H.S. HOSPITAL TRUST HE'S JOHN ADLER GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THESE ARE THEY NOT OBJECTIVE STANDARD SO YOU CAN'T OBJECT ONE NEW FAILED TO MEET THEM
I THINK THE FIRST THING TODAY OUR OBJECTIVE STANDARDS AND THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT THE STANDARD THAT WE HAVE TO MEET HIS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PROCEDURES ON CHILDREN PER SURGEON PER YEAR AND WE WILL MEET THAT STANDARD THIS YEAR LAST YEAR WE DID THREE HUNDRED THIRTY IF YOU MULTIPLY UNDER TWENTY FIVE BY THREE WE HAVE THREE SURGEONS THAT'S THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE WE WILL GET THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THIS YEAR SO WHY ARE YOU BEING AS IT WERE IN EFFECT CLOSED OUT
WELL THAT'S WHERE WE TALK ABOUT THE RATIONALITY OF IT THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE BASIC MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS THIS PIECE OF WORK THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN VOLUME AND OUTCOMES AIDS ESSENTIALLY A PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT ARGUMENT AND WE BUY INTO THAT COMPLETELY THE PROBLEM IS THAT WEEK FOR WHATEVER REASON AND IT IS ENGLAND ARE INSISTING ON CLOSING A CENTRE WHICH
ALSO A VERY IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE IS WE HAVE JUSTICE GOOD OUTCOMES AS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE I THINK WE PUZZLED BECAUSE YOU YOU AGREE WITH THE STANDARD YOU SAID SUBJECTIVE AND YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING YOUR MEETING IT AND YET BEING CLOSED WHAT IS THE REASON THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO LEICESTER N.H.S. HOSPITAL TRUST AS TO WHY YOU CANNOT CARRY ON TREATING PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX HEART DISEASE
THE REASON BEING GIVEN TO US IS SIMPLY THAT IT IS ENGLAND DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GET TO THE NUMBER THAT HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED BUT WE THINK THAT THE YET TREATING QUITE ENOUGH PEOPLE NO THAT'S RIGHT BUT WE WILL DO SO THIS YEAR BUT AT THE OTHER THING BUT THIS CAN GET QUITE COMPLICATED BUT TRY AND KEEP IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS AT THE MOMENT WE ARE MARGINALLY SHORT OF THE NUMBERS THE EVIDENCE SPACES THAT ACTUALLY ANYTHING ABOUT ABOUT EIGHTY
PROCEDURES POSTAGE AND PER YEAR IS WHERE'S WHERE THE SORT OF TIPPING POINT IS THEY WERE WELL ABOVE THAT AND THE KEY THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IN FORCING THIS APPROACH IT WILL CAUSE A GREAT DEAL OF DESTABILISATION FOR EXAMPLE TO CHILDREN'S INTENSIVE CARE CAPACITY WHICH WE KNOW FROM OUR COVERAGE LAST WEEK HE'S HE'S IN A STATE OF CRISIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WERE SIMPLY ISN'T SUFFICIENT
AND THEREFORE THE PRICE BEING PAID FOR THIS MARGINAL GAME IS SIMPLY TOO GREAT IT'S WHY WE DESCRIBE IT AS A RASH YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT USING ALL THE MEANS AT OUR DISPOSAL TO REVERSE THIS INTENTION THAT IS CODE FOR GOING TO COURT ISN'T IT NOT NECESSARILY WE ARE TAKING LEGAL ADVICE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY SCOPE THERE MINOR WAS A JUDICIAL REVIEW FORGIVE ME THAT WAS A JUDICIAL REVIEW WASN'T THERE A FEW YEARS AGO IN THE ROYAL BROMPTON MANAGED TO OVERTURN A DECISION
THAT'S RIGHT AND INDEED THERE WAS ANOTHER BODY CALLED INDEPENDENT FOR ASIAN PARA WHICH ALSO OVERTURN THE LAST DECISION THIS SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE REVIEW WHICH IS THE ONE YOU'RE REFERRING TO A FEW YEARS AGO WAS IT WAS A MESS I THINK BY BY GENERAL CONSENT THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN BETTER I WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH THAT IT HAS BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT BUT WE FEEL THE CONCLUSION THAT HAS BEEN COME TO IS COMPLETELY PREMATURE AND AS THE SAY WRIST DESTABILISING A SERVICE WHICH IS WHICH IS PRODUCING EXTREMELY GOOD OUTCOMES JOHN WE TALK ABOUT LEICESTER IN BIRMINGHAM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOTHING FOR THE WHOLE OF THE EAST OF ENGLAND THAT WE SERVE AS WELL
# I THINK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL BE TALKING LATER TO THE FATHER OF ONE OF THE PATIENTS AT LEICESTER AND ALSO AS THE DEPUTY MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF AN H.S.E. PLUMBER TWENTY PAST SEVEN NATO HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEAT TODAY IN WARSAW THERE SUMMIT IS GOING TO CONFIRM THAT BRITAIN WILL JOIN THE U.S. CANADA AND GERMANY TO CREATE FOR NATO BATTALIONS TO DEFEND THE BALTIC STATES AND POLAND AGAINST RUSSIAN AGGRESSION WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR US OUR DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HAS BEEN TO ESTONIA WHERE THE BRITISH LET BATTALION IS EXPECTED TO BE STATION
HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES ON A MILITARY TRAINING RANGE IN STONIER AMERICAN TROOPS WATCH BY BRITISH AND DYSTONIA AND SOLDIERS CALLING AIR STRIKES FROM THE U.S. WARPLANE DUBBED THE TANK PAST
THIS IS THE CULMINATION OF A SERIES OF LARGE NATO EXERCISES ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE HELPING TRAIN FOR A CONVENTIONAL WAR AGAINST THE WELL ARMED ENEMY TO REPEL AN INVASION BUT THOSE TAKING PART ARE RELUCTANT TO SAY AGAINST WHOM ABOUT TRAINING WITH A PARK
AND IT IS ABOUT RUSSIA WRITES ABOUT TRAINING WITH OUR PARTNERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE KNOW HOW TO WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THE ALLIES
AND TO SHOW THAT MAKE ME TAUGHT THEM IN THE FACE OF RUSSIAN AGGRESSORS SUPPORT THEM NOT AGAINST SOMEBODY IT'S JUST TO SUPPORT THEM
IT'S SOMEHOW MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND TROOPS FROM ACROSS THE ALLIANCE HAVE BEEN HONING THEIR SKILLS IN OLD FASHIONED HEAVY METAL WARFARE
USING ARTILLERY AND ROCKETS AND MISSILES ALL THE REMINDER OF THE COLD WAR ERA AND ONE OF THOSE SOLDIERS TAKING PART MAY BE RELUCTANT TO SAY THIS IS ABOUT RUSSIA IS STONY AS MOST SENIOR MILITARY COMMANDER GENERAL RE HOTEL HE'S NOT
RUSSIA'S BEHAVIOUR IN THE LAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE AND RUSSIA HAS SHOWN THAT THE WILLING AND CAPABLE OF USING THEIR CONVENTIONAL MILITARY POWER IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THEIR POLITICAL OBJECTIVE
IT'S NOT JUST TRAINING AT THE WARSAW SUMMIT NATO LEADERS WILL CONFIRMED THEY'LL BE REINFORCING THE BALTIC STATES AND POLAND WITH A CONTINUOUS PRESENCE OF AROUND FIVE
ON ITS EATING THEM AND IT'S ALSO INCREASING ITS MILITARY PRESENCE
WITH AROUND FIVE HUNDRED BRITISH TROOPS DUE HERE IT IS FROM THE START
THE CITIZENS OF A OR WANT REASSURANCE EVERY JUNE THEY CELEBRATE THEIR INDEPENDENCE FROM THE OLD SOVIET UNION THIS YEAR THE PEOPLE ARE VERY WHO LIVE JUST THIRTY KILOMETRES FROM THE RUSSIAN BORDER PROUDLY WAIVE THAT A STONY AND FLAGS AS THEY WATCH NATO SOLDIERS TAKE PART IN THE PARADE
WITH US IS A STONY AS PRIME MINISTER FOR HER PRESENCE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
NOT FORMING TROOPS AGAINST RUSSIA BUT THIS IS SENDING A MESSAGE THAT WE ARE HERE TOGETHER WE ARE A ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR
SHOULD BRITISH PEOPLE BE WORRIED THAT THE TROOPS MAY BE IN THE LINE OF DANGER IF THEY COME HERE OF COURSE HE WAS A CHIMP THE NORTHERN NOT BUST THE YARN THAT RUSSIAN EDGY INSUFFERABLE NOT ANOTHER DUE THE SEVENTH O.K. SHE'S CONVENIENT
PRESIDENT PUTIN THOUGH IS NOT GOING TO STAND BY AND WATCH RECENTLY HE ASKS WHY NATO WAS EXPANDING TOWARDS RUSSIA'S BORDER IN RESPONSE RUSSIA'S BEEN STEPPING UP ITS OWN MUCH LARGER SNAP MILITARY EXERCISES NATO SAYS IT WANTS DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA NOT A NEW COLD WAR BUT ITS NEXT MOVE WILL MAKE THAT HARD
# JONATHAN BILL REPORTING THERE SEVEN TWENTY FOUR BACK TO SUNDERLAND ON THE QUESTION OF ENGLAND'S EXPORTING THE REGION'S FUTURE KATIE PRESCOTT IS THERE WITH THE BUSINESS ESTES MONICA
GOOD MORNING IS THERE VOTE FOR BRICKS IT HERE MEANS MORE THAN LOSING THE NORTH EAST BIGGEST MARKET IT'S HARD TO MOVE IN SUNDERLAND WITHOUT TRIPPING OVER AN E.U. FLAG SIGNIFYING FUNDING FOR A BUILDING PROJECT BUT THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOCATING SOME OF THAT CASH IS ANDREW HODGSON HE'S CHAIRMAN OF THE NORTH EAST LOCAL ENTERPRISE PARTNERSHIP THAT'S A VENTURE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS TO IMPLEMENT THE LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN GOOD MORNING ANDREW RON ACATERY
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SIX YEAR PLAN INVOLVING EUROPEAN CASH WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THAT MONEY NOW
WELL TODAY WE'VE COMMITTED ABOUT EIGHTY NINE AND A HALF MILLION POUNDS OVER FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN MILLION POUND PLAN AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FOUR MILLION IN THE PIPELINE BUT OF COURSE THAT MEANS THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION POUNDS WHERE WE'RE NOT CERTAIN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR REASSURANCES FROM GOVERNMENT TO THIS CAN BE REPLACED
SO YOU'RE ASKING GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STUMP UP
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN FOUR LEGS IT WILL BE SO OBVIOUSLY CERTAIN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR SOME REPLICATION OF THE MECHANISM THAT ENABLES US TO GET ACCESS TO THAT MONEY
WHAT WAS THE MONEY FOR WHAT'S GOING TO BE LOST IF IT DOESN'T COME THROUGH WHEN I WILL CURRENT PIPELINE WAS ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF THOUSAND BUSINESSES AND ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE CURRENT CASH AND THAT'S FROM A RANGE OF PROJECTS FOR OUR ENTERPRISE LAWNS THROUGH SOME REAL RURAL NETWORKS BUSINESS GROWTH HOPES SOME SKILLS INVESTMENT I'M SORT OF A WHOLE HEAP OF THINGS IT'S A LOT OF MONEY AND THERE'S CLEARLY A LOT OF PROJECTS ARE SUPPORTED BY THESE BUGGERS CAPITAL
IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY WHAT DO YOU WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO GOVERNMENT NOW WHAT'S YOUR PITCH TO THEM WHAT WE THINK THE NORTH EAST A FANTASTIC PLACE TO INVEST AND THIS THIS IS NOT HAND OUT MONEY WE LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT ALL OUR INVESTMENTS AND WE WANT FURTHER INVESTMENT MONEY FOR THE NORTH EAST WE DO HAVE ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OF OTHER FUNDS THAT WE WERE ALREADY INVESTING SO WE JUST THINK THAT WE WANT TO SEE A FAIR ALLOCATION OF OF FUNDING GOING FORWARD
DO YOU THINK BRICKS IT'S BEEN A DISASTER FOR THE NORTH EAST KICKING OUT ITS BIGGEST MARKET AND ALSO LOSING ALL OF THIS MONEY FROM EUROPEAN FUNDING
I THINK IT'S BROUGHT GREAT UNCERTAINTY BUT IT WAS A POLITICAL DECISION WITH ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES I MEAN WE ARE WHERE WE ARE WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY PRAGMATIC ABOUT IT AND AS I SAY THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO WHICH DON'T INVOLVE FUNDING IT OR WE CAN INVEST IN OUR SKILLS WE CAN BRING SKILLS AND EDUCATION ARE BUSINESS TOGETHER WE COULD BRING INNOVATION THROUGH OUR UNIVERSITIES AND BUSINESS WE COME BY AND OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO SO AND DISASTERS WERE TOO STRONG A WORD WE ARE WHERE WE ARE ON A JOURNEY AND WILL JUST KIND OF PICK UP AND MOVE ON FROM THERE

# SOME LEADING HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND HAVE BEEN TOLD TO STOP PROVIDING COMPLEX HEART CARE BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT STANDARDS IN H. S. ENGLAND HAS CARRIED OUT A REVIEW AND DECIDED THAT SURGERY AND OTHER CARE SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED IN FEWER CENTRES THE ROYAL BROMPTON AND HAREFIELD N.H.S. TRUST IN LONDON IS AMONG THOSE HOSPITALS WHICH WILL NO LONGER CARRY OUT HEART OPERATIONS
# HUNDREDS OF BRITISH TROOPS HAD TO BE SENT TO POLAND AND DYSTONIA AS PART OF NATO'S RESPONSE TO CONCERNS ABOUT RUSSIA THE PRIME MINISTER WILL ANNOUNCE AT THE NATO SUMMIT IN WARSAW THAT THE BATTALION OF FIVE HUNDRED SOLDIERS WILL BE DEPLOYED TO HIS STONIER AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TROOPS WILL BE STATIONED IN POLAND

# GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DELIGHTED TO HAVE WON SO MUCH SUPPORT FROM MY COLLEAGUES ITE ONE BOAT TO WOMEN TO TORIES TO POTENTIAL LEADERS WHO WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT WHETHER THE COUNTRY LIKES IT OR NOT ARE DESTINED TO BE DUBBED THE NEW MAGGIE THAT THOUGH IS WHERE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN MAY AND LED SOME END WHAT OF COURSE MADE THE CASE EVER SO QUIETLY FOR REMAIN THE OTHER ARGUED EVER SO PASSIONATELY
LEAVE ONE IS HIGHLY EXPERIENCED THE LONGEST SERVING HOME SECRETARY FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY THE OTHER WOULD BE THE LEAST EXPERIENCE PRIME MINISTER THIS COUNTRY HAS HAD SINCE PITT YOUNGER NOT ONLY IS ANDREA LED TO MAD NO CABINET EXPERIENCE UNLIKE DAVID CAMERON OR TONY BLAIR SHE IS NOT SERVED AN APPRENTICESHIP AS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION
BUT THIS RUN OFF IS ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN THAT MAY AND LED SOME OF FIGUREHEADS FOR TWO VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS OF CONSERVATISM BACKED BY DIFFERENT FACTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN AT WAR IN THE PARTY FOR NIGH ON A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
WELL DO HERE
YESTERDAY ANDREA LENGTHENS BAGGERS MARCHED ON WETS MINSTER THE SOUND A BIT SUITED MINISTERIAL TORIES CHANTING MAY SEEM A LITTLE INCONGRUOUS BUT IT WAS IN TRUTH THE PERFECT SYMBOL OF THE FACT THAT SHE AND MANY OF HER BACKER'S SEE THEMSELVES AS PART OF A SORT OF PEASANTS' REVOLT AGAINST THE TORY ESTABLISHMENT AND AGAINST DAVID CAMERON'S PROJECT AT TORY MODERNISATION SAME COACHES THE DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR OF THE TIMES
ANDREW IS THE CANDIDATE OF THE TRADITIONAL RIGHT NOW EIGHT DAYS AGO SHE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A TRIBE OF HER OWN BUT SOME FIGURES FROM THE TRADITIONAL RICE THE PARTY DECIDED THAT SHE WAS THEIR BEST HOPE OF GETTING INTO POWER YOU WILL SEED SOME SIMILARITIES IN ANDREW LEADS AND CAMPAIGN TEAM GOING BACK ALL THE WAY TO NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHEN JOHN REDWOOD TRIED TO OUST JOHN MAJOR
FROM DOWNING STREET YOU'LL ALSO SEE SOME SIMILARITIES IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE WHEN I.D.S. IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WENT FOR THE TORY CROWNED SUCCESSFULLY ONLY TO BE THROWN OUT THREE YEARS LATER SO THERE IS A STRAW AND THAT RUN THROUGH THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY STRETCHING BACK TWENTY YEARS
LET'S PITCH OF COURSE LOOKS TO THE FUTURE SHE PRESENTS HERSELF AS A TRUE BELIEVER AN OPTIMIST ABOUT BRITAIN'S FUTURE RATHER THAN A RELUCTANT CONVERT TO THE CAUSE OF BRECK'S IT BENEATH THIS THOUGH SHE SEEKING TO BUILD A COALITION OF MANY TORY ACTIVISTS WHO DAVID CAMERON HAS ANTAGONISED OVER THE PAST DECADE AS HIS PARTY'S LEADER THOSE WHO OBJECTED TO GAY MARRIAGE
THOSE RESISTING THE BUILDING OF H. S. TWO THOSE YOU WANT TO SEE A VOTE TO LIFT THE LEGAL BAN ON FOX HUNTING THOSE WHO WANT A MORE RADICAL AND MORE RESOLUTE AND MORE THATCHERITE APPROACH FOUR YEARS AGO LED SOME URGED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO WORKERS' RIGHTS FOR COMPANIES WITH THREE OR FEWER EMPLOYEES
I COULD ENVISAGE A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAD NO REGULATION WHATSOEVER NO MINIMUM WAGE NO MATERNITY OR PATERNITY RIGHTS NO UNFAIR DISMISSAL RITES AND
AND NO PENSION RIGHTS ABSOLUTELY NO REGULATION WHATSOEVER FOR THE VERY SMALLEST COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO GET OFF THE GROUND IF THAT SPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS ONE REASON THE TORY RIGHT WARMS TO ANDREA LEAD SOME ANOTHER MUCH MORE FAMOUS SPEECH EXPLAINS WHY THEY'RE SO SUSPICIOUS OF THERESA MAY OUR BASE IS TOO NARROW AND SO OCCASIONALLY OUR SYMPATHIES YOU KNOW WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL US THE NASTY PART
I KNOW THAT'S UNFAIR YOU KNOW THAT'S UNFAIR BUT IT'S THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WE NEED TO CONVINCE AND WE CAN ONLY DO THAT BY AVOIDING BEHAVIOUR AND ATTITUDES THAT PLAY INTO THE HANDS OF A
NO MORE CLIP MORALISING NO MORE HYPOCRITICAL FINGER WAGGING WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO ALL AREAS OF OUR SOCIETY THAT WAS THE FAVOURITE TO BE THE NEXT TORY LEADER SPEAKING BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TO IS WHAT CONVINCED SOME INNER PARTY THAT MAY HE'S TOO POLITICALLY CORRECT
TO ESTABLISHMENT TOO CAUTIOUS SAM COATS OF THE TIMES AGAIN ONE OF THE FASCINATING THINGS ABOUT THERESA MAY IS SHE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A TRIBE ONCE UPON A TIME SHE WAS A MODERNISER SHE RATHER SHED THAT IMAGE WHEN SHE WAS HOME SECRETARY AND THE PEOPLE STANDING BEHIND HER OR A KIND OF ORDER LOOSE COALITION OF PEOPLE HAVE WORKED WITH HER PEOPLE WHO ARE CAREERISTS AND PEOPLE DRAWN FROM THE WING OF THE PARTY THAT CONSIDERED THEMSELVES TO BE PRAGMATIST IT'S A SORT OF MELTING POT OF ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE
THERESA MAY DOES HAVE THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF TORY M.P.S STRIKINGLY SHE ALSO HAS THE BACKING OF NEWSPAPERS AS DIVERSE AS THE MAIL AND THE MIRROR AND THE SUN SO SAY SOME SHE IS SURE TO WIN BUT REMEMBER THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT THE REFERENDUM THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID BEFORE HE ENDORSED BRECK'S IT BEFORE HE ENDORSED ANDREA LET'S
STUNNING ACHIEVEMENT BY ANDREA LET'S UM I THINK SHE'S GOING TO PROVIDE EXACTLY THE RIGHT KIND OF POSITIVE AND OPTIMISTIC
CONFIDENT LEADERSHIP THAT THIS COUNTRY BORIS JOHNSON WAS CLEARLY NOT IMPRESSED BY THERESA MAY'S DECLARATION THE BRAKES IT MEANS BRICKS IT HE KNOWS SHE KNOWS WE KNOW THE TRUTH IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT BREAKS IT MAY SAYS WE'LL TAKE TIME IT'LL BE COMPLEX IT'LL NEED AN EXPERIENCED NEGOTIATOR BREAKS IT LED SOME IMPLIES IN CONTRAST NEEDS TO BE DELIVERED FAST SHOULD BE EMBRACED SHOULD BE TREATED WITH HOPE AND NOT FEAR I CAN'T HEAR YOU
WHO THEN SHOULD THE COUNTRY BE READY FOR TERESA OR ANDREA THAT QUESTION WILL SEEM FOCUS ON MUCH MUCH MORE THAN SIMPLY A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT WOMEN
AND AT TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT LET US TURN TO THE PAPERS WHICH OF COURSE ARE ALL DOMINATED BY ALL OF THAT THE MALE IN THE TIMES SAYING THEIR DEMANDS BY SOME CONSERVATIVE M.P.S TO SPEED UP THE LEADERSHIP CONTEST FOLLOWING WHAT THE MAIL DESCRIBES AN HISTORIC DAY AT WESTMINSTER THE REALISATION THAT BRITAIN IS TO GET IT SECOND WOMAN PRIME MINISTER BOTH PAPERS REPORT THAT MORE THAN FORTY M.P.S WANT EITHER HOME SECRETARIES THERESA MAY ALL THE ENERGY MINISTER ANDREW LEADS
TO DOWNING STREET IN DOWNING STREET IN SITU BEFORE SEPTEMBER THE NINTH WHEN THE CONTEST IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCLUDED THE BACKBENCHERS HAVE SIGNED A LETTER CALLING FOR A FASTER TIME TABLE IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST THE TIME SAYS THE LETTER WAS ORGANISED BY THE POTTY FORMER PARTY CHAIRMAN GRANT SHOUTS WHO SUPPORTS MISSUS MAY THE PAPER BELIEVES A TRUNCATED CONTEST WOULD HELPER SINCE IT WILL GIVE MISSUS LED SOME LESS TIME TO INTRODUCE HERSELF TO GRASSROOTS TORIES ACCORDING TO THE TIME SOME CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE MISTER CAMERON IS INSISTING ON THE CURRENT TIME TABLE
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SWAN SONG WITH WORLD LEADERS AT A G.TWENTY SUMMIT IN SEPTEMBER IT IS AN ABSURD TIME TO WAITRESS THE SUM WHICH ONCE THE VOTING PERIOD HALVED BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IT SAYS CAN'T BE RUDDERLESS FOR SO LONG ALISON PHILLIPS AND THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE A SUMMER OF STATEMENT JEWELLERY POWER SUITS AND FEROCIOUSLY SET HAIR THE LIKE OF WHICH WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE ALEXIS COLBY
KRYSTAL CARRINGTON OR IN DYNASTY THE COLONISTS SAYS SHE CAN'T RESIST THE SEXUAL STEREOTYPING IN THE CASE OF MISSUS MAY AND MISSUS LED SOME DAILY TELEGRAPHS MATT CARTOON HAS TWO MEN PLAYING GOLF AND ONE IS SAYING TO THE OTHER ONLY MEN CAN BE MEMBERS HERE A WOMAN'S PLACE
# HE'S RUNNING THE COUNTRY THE GARDAI MEANWHILE IS REPORTING THAT THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN IS EXPECTED TO OFFER HIS BACKBENCHERS A FREE VOTE IN THE COMMONS DEBATES THE RENEWAL OF THE TRIDENT NUCLEAR WEAPONS SYSTEM AN ISSUE WHICH DIVIDES MY CAULDRON OF COURSE FOR MANY LABOUR M.P.S ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY LABOUR REBELS WILL INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON HIM TO RESIGN BY VOTING AGAINST HIM ON THE ISSUE LATER THIS MONTH THE TIMES AS FURTHER COVERAGE OF THE CHOKER INQUIRY PICKING UP ON CRITICISMS OF SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE WHO WAS HEAD OF M.I.SIX IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE

THE GOVERNMENT BLAMED WESTERN EMBASSIES AND FAILED POLITICAL PARTIES SOCIAL MEDIA DISSIDENTS RECEIVED A STERN WARNING

BY STANDARDS THAT EVEN WE DIDN'T EXPECT BUSINESSES HAVE CLOSED DOWN TRANSPORT HEADS HEADS HAS STAYED AWAY PEOPLE LITERALLY STAYED INDOORS BECAUSE IF WE GO TO THE STREETS WE GET
THAT IS TRUE THIS WAS MONDAY IN HARARE
TAXI DRIVERS DEMONSTRATED OVER THE MULTIPLE POLICE ROAD BLOCKS SEEN AS TOOLS OF RAISIN EXTORTION THAT VIDEOS POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA SHOWED POLICE BRUTALLY BEATING PEOPLE WITH BAT ON
IT WAS A RIOT AT THE SOUTH AFRICAN BORDER POST WITH TRADERS WERE STOPPED FROM IMPORTING GOODS UNDER A NEW LAW
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AS MUCH AS NINETY PERCENT WITH NO CASH IN THE ECONOMY CIVIL SERVANTS OF BEING PAID DOCTORS AND NURSES ARE ON STRIKE
FINANCE MINISTER PATRICK MARTHA HAS BEEN IN EUROPE PUSHING FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT SPEAKING TO THE B.B.C.'S HARD TALK PROGRAMME THIS WEEK HE BLAMED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY EVERYTHING CAMBRIDGE SAYS BAD TORSTEN DWARF WE

# THAT WAS ALISTAIR LEAF HEAD REPORTING IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER AND A GLASGOW STUDIO THIS MORNING HE'S JOHN BELL OF THE IONA COMMUNITY COME ON IT GOOD MORNING THERE'S A FLEECE WHICH HAS BECOME COMMONPLACE AT THE CONCLUSION OF A DEBATE OR REPORT ON A SIGNIFICANT DISASTER WHETHER THAT REALLY LIKES THEM PUT A FINANCIAL COLLAPSE AND THIS PHRASE SAYS IT COULD CONTINUOUSLY SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE CHILCOTT REPORT IT CONSISTS OF THE WEREN'T LESSONS WILL BE AWARE
I SOMETIMES WONDER WHY GIVEN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT FACE HAS BEEN REPEATED WE'RE NOT PERFECT PEOPLE
THAT IS BECAUSE THE FREEZE HAS AN INHERENT WEAKNESS IT SUGGESTS THAT THERE WAS ALMOST A CORRECT PROCEDURE WHICH HAVE FOLLOWED WILL YIELD RESULTS BUT IF ABANDONED WILL LEAD TO MISTAKES THAT HOLDS FOR SOME THINGS BUT NOT FOR ALL
MANY CHILDREN GO TO PIANO LESSONS BUT EVEN IF THEY GET THE FINGER GREAT AND CAN PLAY SCALES PERFECTLY THAT DOESN'T LEAD TO GUARANTEED SUCCESS ON THE CONCERT PLATFORM OR EVEN THE ASPIRING PIANISTS DEVELOPING A LOVE FOR MUSIC
MANY PEOPLE WHO IN THE YOUNGER YEAR HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO LAY BEETHOVEN'S FUR ELISE WILL AGREE YOU CANNOT ACQUIRE MUSICALITY SIMPLY BY GOING TO PIANO LESSONS
SOME PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE CHILCOTT REPORT DOES NOT HAVE MANY LESSONS REGARDING THE FUTURE MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE THINGS LIKE STATESMANSHIP POLITICAL INTEGRITY APPROPRIATE MILITARY ENGAGEMENT CANNOT BE ACQUIRED SIMPLY BY FOLLOWING RULES
SUCH THINGS ARE THE FRUITS OF WEST THEM
AND WEARS THEM AS NOT THE PRODUCT OF A COURSE OF INSTRUCTION LEADING TO A DOCTORATE AND PHILOSOPHY IT IS THE MATURE REFLECTION ON PERCEPTION INTUITION AND EXPERIENCE AND IT TENDS NOT TO SPEAK AND PLATITUDES BUT TO ENCAPSULATE A PROFUNDITY AND ONCE AT ALL CAN PONDER
JESUS WHO'S HEBREW TRADITION A SUPPOSED TO WEST THEM AS ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS GIFTS OF GOD WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST AND MOST SUCCINCT EXPOSE HER TOAST
TWO OF HIS OBSERVATIONS WHICH I SLIGHTLY PARAPHRASE SEEM TO ME TO BE PARTICULARLY PERTINENT AS WE CONSIDER THE FINDINGS OF THE CHILCOT INQUIRY
THE FIRST AS THIS WHEN A IN PRESENCE THE KITS ARE POLICE HAD ME COME BACK AND FIND A CLEAN GO AND FIND SEVEN OTHERS TO MAKE THE POLICE EVEN WORSE THAN BEFORE
THAT WEEK OBSERVATION IS AS PIGMENT TO REGIME CHANGE IN A VILLAGE HALL AS MUCH AS THE NATION AND THE SECOND CONCERNS ANY ENDEAVOUR POLITICAL OR PERSONAL WHICH HAS RAMIFICATIONS AFFECTING OTHERS
NO ONE BUILDS A TERROR WITHOUT FIRST COUNTING THE COURSE
HERE AS ELSEWHERE JESUS DOES NOT MAKE INTELLECTUAL CONJECTURE US BUT OFFERS DEEP PERCEPTIONS ON LEFT LATE
THIS IS WEST THEM NEITHER A CRITIQUE NO WHAT A SOLUTION BUT A GIFT WHICH COMES FROM HEAVEN AND EARTH
IT IS CALLED AN SCRIPTURE NOTHING LESS THAN THE DIALLING AND DELIGHT OF GOD SOMETHING TO BE SAW IT AS IF IT WERE A BURIED TREASURE
# AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH JOHN BELL THE TIME IS EXACTLY TEN TO EIGHT
THOUSANDS OF NATO TROOPS TO BE SENT TO THE BORDER A RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN DEPLOYMENT MISSILES A WAR OF WORDS IT IS ALL VERY REMINISCENT OF THE COLD WAR TODAY A SUMMIT OF NATO LEADERS IN WARSAW WILL SIGN OFF A PLAN TO DEPLOY TWO TO THREE THOUSAND TROOPS TO POLAND AND THE BALTIC STATES WHO WANTED LOST THE PRIME MINISTER WILL ATTEND PERHAPS THE LAST TWO FOR OUR DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON I SPOKE TO HIM BEFORE HE SET OFF AND ASKED HIM WHY THESE DEPLOYMENTS ON RUSSIA'S BORDERS WERE NEEDED
BUT THEY'RE NEEDED TO REASSURE OUR ALLIES ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF NATO
THAT NATO IS THERE TO PROTECT THEM TO DETER RUSSIA FROM ANY FURTHER AGGRESSIVE MOVES WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CRUMB HERE AND THE UKRAINE THEY'RE ALSO TO DEMONSTRATE CONTINUING BRITISH LEADERSHIP IN NATO WE'RE GOING TO BE ONE OF ONLY FOUR COUNTRIES PUTTING A BATTALION INTO ONTO THE EASTERN BORDER WILL BE COMMITTING ADDITIONAL TROOPS TO POLAND AS WELL DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE MAY SAY THIS LOOKS LIKE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE NEW COLD WAR NO NATO WAS A DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE
THESE ARE MEASURES TO REASSURE THOSE COUNTRIES ON THE EASTERN SIDE ESTONIA LATVIA LITHUANIA AND POLAND COUNTRIES LIKE THAT THAT WE'RE READY TO COME TO THEIR ASSISTANCE SO THEY'RE THERE TO REASSURE AND TO DETER THEY'RE NOT THERE TO TO BE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS ANYBODY NATO ALWAYS SAID IT WAS A DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE AND OF COURSE THAT'S NOT HOW IT WAS SEEN IN MOSCOW
DO LEADERS HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT IT WILL NOT BE SEEN THAT WAY IN MOSCOW NOW THEY WILL BE FEARFUL OF WHAT YOUR OBJECTIVES REALLY ARE WE WANT TO DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA AND THERE IS A FRAMEWORK FOR THAT MEETINGS OF THE NATO RUSSIA OR COUNCIL AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF AREAS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE WERE
TO WORK WITH RUSSIA FOR EXAMPLE WE DID OVER THE DEAL IN IRAN STOPPING THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAMME WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH RUSSIA AND BRING IN THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA TO AN END WE WANT A PROPER ENGAGEMENT WITH RUSSIA BUT WE CAN'T FORGET WHAT HAPPENED WHICH IS THAT RUSSIA TRIED TO CHANGE INTERNATIONAL BORDERS BY FORCE THAT HAS DESTABILISE COUNTRIES ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF NATO AND THIS IS THE KIND OF REASSURANCE THEY'VE BEEN SEEKING
NOW BEFORE THE REFERENDUM VOTE YOU SAID TO LEAVE THE E.U. WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY IRRESPONSIBLE AT A DANGEROUS TIME WHAT YOU NOW SAY AROUND THAT NATO SUMMIT TABLE SORRY I'VE GOT IT WRONG IT'S FINE WE WILL STILL BE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS ALLIANCE
WELL IT ISN'T FINE IT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT BUT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE IN MY VIEW IT DOES THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES ADD TO WHAT NATO GIVES US BUT NATO IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR DEFENCE AND WHAT WILL BE TELLING OTHER LEADERS OTHER DEFENCE MINISTERS TODAY IS THAT WE'LL BE DOING MORE IN NATO TO COMPENSATE FOR A WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL BE LEADING HARDER INTO THE ALLIANCE AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE DEPLOYMENTS THAT WE'RE ANNOUNCING TODAY MORE TROOPS IN POLAND AND A WHOLE BATTALION OF TROOPS IN A STONY
DOING MORE IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT NOW IF YOUR WARNINGS IN THE WARNINGS OF DAVID CAMERON GEORGE OSBORNE AND OTHERS WERE RIGHT IF INDEED THE COUNTRY GETS POORER IN THE SHORT TERM AS A RESULT OF THIS VOTE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO MUCH LESS RATHER THAN MORE WE'RE ALL WORKING EXTREMELY HARD THE CHANCELLOR AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE WE STABILISED THE ECONOMY AND THAT WE DON'T SEE HER PAWS HAVE AN INVESTMENT AND A SLACKENING OFF
OR OF GROWTH BUT THE DEFENCE BUDGET IS GOING UP IT WENT UP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX YEARS IN APRIL AND IT IS COMMITTED TO INCREASING EVERY SINGLE YEAR OF THIS PARLIAMENT AND IT NEEDS TO BECAUSE WE FACED THREATS WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH A DASH IN THE MIDDLE EAST WE'VE GOT THIS AGGRESSION FROM RUSSIA AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ARMED FORCES HAVE THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED THE NATO TARGET AS YOU KNOW IS A PERCENTAGE OF G.D.P. TWO PER CENT OF THE NATION'S WEALTH CLEARLY FOR A LESS WEALTHY THAT'S LESS MONEY
WELL WE'RE MEETING THEIR TARGET AT THE MOMENT OR ARE ONE OF ONLY FIVE COUNTRIES TO DO SO WE'RE COMFORTABLY MEETING THEIR TARGET TO GET EASIER TO MEET BUT IT INVOLVES LESS MONEY IF THE IF THE ECONOMY IS GETTING SMALLER
BUT THAT MAY BE SO BUT THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE IS COMMITTED TO INCREASE EVERY YEAR OF THIS PARLIAMENT SO LET'S LET'S NOT START TALKING OURSELVES INTO SOMETHING THAT ISN'T HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT LET'S NOT TALK OURSELVES DOWN WE ARE COMMITTED TO SPENDING MORE AND OUR DEFENCE AND YOU'RE HERE AT FARNBOROUGH NEXT WEEK AT THE AIR SHOW I HOPE A WHOLE SERIES OF ANNOUNCEMENTS COMMITTING US TO THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE STRATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW
BEFORE CHRISTMAS THIS LOOKS LIKELY TO BE THE PRIME MINISTER'S LAST EVER NATO SUMMIT IN AS AN EMERGENCY ONE IS CALLED HIS SUCCESSOR WILL COME NOW YOU'RE KNOWN TO BE A SUPPORTER OF THERESA MAY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO FELLOW DEFENCE MINISTERS TO FELLOW PRIME MINISTER'S IF THEY SAY
# IS THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY REALLY CONTEMPLATING CHOOSING AN ALMOST COMPLETE NOVICE AS ITS NEXT LEADER FIRST I'LL BE REASSURING THEM THAT THE DECISION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES NOT MEAN BRITAIN IS TURNING ITS BACK ON THE WORLD ON THE CONTRARY IT WILL BE WORKING EVEN HARDER WITH OUR ALLIES ARE KEY ALLIES LIKE THE UNITED STATES WILL BE DOING MORE IN THESE OTHER ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS LIKE NATO WILL BE TAKING A LEADING ROLE IN PEACE KEEPING BRITAIN ST IS WILL REMAIN AN INTERNATIONAL
OBVIOUSLY I'M A SUPPORTER OF THERESA MAY BECAUSE I THINK AT THIS POINT SHE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT TRACK RECORD TO TAKE THE COUNTRY FORWARD NOW TO STABILISE THE ECONOMY COULD ENDURE A ROOM IT'S A SECURITY WELL INTO VINCENT SECURITY WOULD THERE BE RISKS IN NOT CHOOSING THE PERSON YOU REGARD AS THE EXPERIENCE THE SAFE GANDER
WELL I'M I'M I'M NOT GOING TO KNOCK HIM AT HER HER OPPONENT BUT I'M COMMITTED TO THERESA MAY HAVE WORKED WITH HER ON SECURITY DAY IN DAY OUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS CONTRACT THEN CHOOSING HER BECAUSE SHE HAS THE SHE HAS THE EXPERIENCE SHE'S ALREADY A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SHE WORKS TO PROTECT HOMELAND SECURITY JUST AS I DEAL WITH THREATS ABROAD LIKE LIKE DASH AND OUR COMMITMENTS TO NATO AND WE WORK TOGETHER AND I'VE SEEN
I'VE SEEN HER DEAL WITH CRISIS I'VE SEEN HER CHURCH THE COBRA EMERGENCY COMMITTEE I'VE SEEN A HANDLE THESE THINGS AND SHE'S ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED ABOVE ALL TO KEEPING THIS COUNTRY SAFE AND CHOOSE MY CHOICE MICHAEL FALLON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

HE'S INVOLVED IN A STAND OFF SITUATION WITH OFFICERS THEY HAVE BEEN EXCHANGING SOME GUNFIRE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THIS PERSON WHO IS A PARTY NOT CO OPERATING AND HAS BEEN MAKING NUMEROUS THREATS SAYING THINGS LIKE THE END IS COMING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HURT AND KILL MORE KILMORE OFFICERS SAYING THAT THERE ARE BOMBS ALL OVER THE PLACE REFERRING TO THE GARAGE PARKING STRUCTURE WEATHER HOLD OPENED AN IMPOSSIBLY DOWNTOWN
DALLAS AS WELL SO ARE STILL A VERY TENSE SITUATION AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE VERY VERY LATE AT NIGHT OF COURSE IN DALLAS AT THE MOMENT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD IF YOU WORK IN DOWNTOWN DALLAS DON'T COME TO WORK IN THE MORNING THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS AREA IS SAFE AND IT SEEMS THAT THEY'VE GOT QUITE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE THEY CAN ACHIEVE AND THESE PEOPLE SAYING THEY WANT TO TO ATTACK THE POLICE BUT NOT SAYING WHY
NO AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE POLICE CHIEF HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT THEY ARE GETTING VERY LITTLE CO OPERATION THEY ARE STILL FAR FROM UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS MOTIVATING THESE PEOPLE THE POLICE SEEM TO BE FAIRLY CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE WORKING TOGETHER THE POLICE CHIEF SAID THEY WERE TRIANGULATED IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS WITH THEIR RIFLES AIMED AT PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AND SPECIFICALLY AMBUSH THE STYLE AT THE POLICE OFFICER'S IMPLYING THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANNING OF THIS EVENT OF THE ROOT OF THE PROTESTERS WOULD TAKEN THAT IT HAD BEEN
# SEEMINGLY QUITE CAREFULLY PLANNED PIT OF THOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY PAST EIGHT DON'T TAKE ME HOME PLEASE DON'T TAKE ME HOME THAT WAS THE CHANT SUNG BY WELSH FOOTBALL FANS AS THEIR DREAM ENDED TODAY THE TEAM DOES RETURN HOME TO WHAT WILL NO DOUBT BE A HERO'S WELCOME IN CARDIFF BUT WILL THEIR SUCCESS WILL THE INFECTIOUS EXCITEMENT OF THEIR FANS CHANGE THE WAY THE COUNTRY'S SEEN AROUND THE WORLD WILL IT MEAN THAT IS JUST A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR WELSH PEOPLE TO EXPLAIN
WHAT EXACTLY THEIR COUNTRY IS NOT IN OTHER WORDS A PART OF ENGLAND TO DISCUSS THAT WE'RE JOINED BY PROFESSOR ANNETTE PRITCHARD HE'S PROFESSOR OF TOURISM AT CARDIFF METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY AND A DIRECTOR OF THE WELSH CENTRE FOR TOURISM RESEARCH AND ALSO BY PROFESSOR PETER STEAD CULTURAL AND SPORTING HISTORY MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR PRITCHARD FIRST OF ALL
IS IT REALLY THAT DIFFICULT FOR WALES TO BE AS IT WERE ON THE GLOBAL MAP FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WALES IS
YES TRADITIONALLY IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR WALES IT'S HAD SUFFERED FROM VERY LOW BRAND AWARENESS BRAND RECOGNITION AND KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTION ABOUT WHAT WHALES IT SO THE FIRST MINISTER CARWYN JONES SAID HE WAS HOPEFULLY NO LONGER HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE IT'S NOT A PART OF ENGLAND DO YOU THINK A FOOTBALL MATCH THIS ONE TOURNAMENT CAN REALLY MAKE THAT DIFFERENT
I DEFINITELY DO THINK THAT THIS THIS FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT HAS BEEN AMAZING IN TERMS OF PUTTING WALES ON THE GLOBAL STAGE IT'S GOT VERY FAIRYTALE QUALITIES A JOURNEY OF THE TEAM FROM ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEENTH IN THE WORLD A FEW YEARS AGO TWO SEMI FINALISTS OF THE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ONE WHICH JUST CAPTURED THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE GLOBAL MEDIA SPORTING FANS AROUND THE WORLD AND I THINK IT'S BEEN A GREAT TALE TO TELL
AND THAT'S ONLY GOING TO HELP WALES IN THE FUTURE TELL STELLA TAIL SHARE OF COURSE PETER STEAD THERE IS ALWAYS A DANGER THERE IS NO YOU'RE A HISTORIAN A DANGER THAT WE KID OURSELVES AFTER ALL LONDON DID OFF THE OLYMPICS IN TWENTY TWELVE THAT SOMEHOW ONE SPORTING EVENT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING IT IS IT'S ALWAYS A PROBLEM WITH THAT WITH POPULAR CULTURE THAT THINGS CAN BE EPHEMERAL BUT I THINK I THINK THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A PROFOUND CHANGE WE SURPRISE OURSELVES WE WERE DELIGHTED BY THE WAY IN WHICH THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN LONDON ESPECIALLY
HAS JOINED IN THE WELSH SUCCESS I CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE TODAY PROGRAMME FOR THE WONDERFUL WAY THAT IF HE LET YOU USE THIS GOOD NEWS FROM WALES YOU KNOW TO OFFSET THE SORT OF IT WITH HER AND HER BUTTONS YOU'VE HAD IT IS IT IS IT IS A GOOD STORY AND A NEW IMAGE OF WALES HAS EMERGED ESCAPED FROM STEREOTYPES BECAUSE I THINK ALL THE PEOPLE WE'VE SEEN ON THE STREETS OF LYONS AND SO ON THE WAY THEY'VE DONE US PROUD THAT KNOW THEY'RE NICE LOOKING THEY SPEAK NICELY YOU'VE GOT A SENSE OF HUMOUR THEY WERE WONDERFUL SONGS
THEY BEHAVED IMPECCABLY I THINK WE'VE SURPRISED OURSELVES YOU KNOW WE SUDDENLY REALISED WE A SLIGHTLY MORE MATURE BETTER EDUCATED MORE COSMOPOLITAN COUNTRY THAN WE THOUGHT WE WERE AND CERTAINLY I THINK WE'VE DO IT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON THIS FOOTBALL FOR MO'S ALWAYS POPULAR IN WALES BUT THERE'S BEEN AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW CONTRAS I'D SAY YES IN THE LAST TWO DECADES THERE ARE ELEMENTS IN WALES IN THE B. B. C. AND IN THE PRESS WHO HAD TO DELIBERATELY CULTIVATED RUGBY AS A BADGE OF WELSH IDENTITY
BUT RUGBY IS ALWAYS BEEN A REGIONAL GAME IN WALES WHERE HIS FOOTBALL PAID FOR ALL QUILLS JUSTIN IS SMILING AND HUMPHRIES IS NOT HERE TO ANSWER THERE'S BEEN A REAL SOUNDS WORSE I DID HAD YOU TO TALK TO MY COLLEAGUES I TAUGHT IN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES AND SPEND THE LOT ON ELECTION TIME EXPLAINING THAT WEARS DOESN'T JUST EXIST
IN A FEUD IN FANTASY BUT SINCE SWANSEA HAD BEEN IN THE PREMIERSHIP CONNIE'S GOING AROUND THE WORLD TO CHINA TO MALAYSIA TO AMERICA REALISED THAT SWANSEA IS BETTER KNOWN THAN WALES AND BETTER THOUGH THE CARDIFF AS WELL BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM CONTROVERSIAL CLAIM THEIR PROFESSORS DEFINITELY BEEN PROFESSOR PUT YOUR BACK IN A FUN EH
THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING GOING ON ALSO ABOUT THE ENGLISH ATTITUDE TO THE WELSH ISN'T THERE I WAS SURROUNDED BY WELSH FANS IN LYON JUST TWO NIGHTS AGO AND ENJOYING IT THEY SEEM RATHER PLEASED THAT AN ENGLISHMAN WAS CHEERING THEM ON DO YOU THINK THAT WILL ALSO HELP BECAUSE MOST OF YOUR TOURISM COMES FROM OTHER PEOPLE IN THE U.K. NOW DOESN'T IT
UNDOUBTEDLY I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A MASSIVE BOOST TO THE DOMESTIC TOURISM MARKET FOR WALES YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCHING THE WELSH GAMES I THINK THERE'S BEEN A REALLY FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE LOTS OF ENGLISH FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN TELLING ME THAT THEIR SUPPORT IN WALES IN THAT TOURNAMENT YES I THINK THERE'S A PERHAPS LORD MATURE RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPING BETWEEN ENGLAND AND WALES AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE THE THE IMAGE THE SUCCESS THEY HAVE THE FAIRYTALE QUALITY
HOWEVER ADVERTISERS ARE PICKING UP ON THAT FAIRYTALE QUALITY I THINK THAT IS GOING TO ENCOURAGE MORE ENGLISH PEOPLE TO COME TO WALES COS I THINK IT'S BEEN A VERY WELCOMING A VERY ATTRACTIVE TEAM ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE YOU KNOW THAT CAN ONLY BE GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED PROFESSOR PRITCHARD PROFESSOR PETER STEAD AS WELL THE MEMORY I WILL CHERISH FROM LYON IS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO A GROUP OF GERMAN FANS WHY THE WELSH FANS WERE CLAPPING AND CHANTING SHEEP

# A NUMBER OF HOSPITALS RENOWNED FOR TREATING HEART DISEASE HAVE BEING TOLD THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER CARRY OUT COMPLICATED SURGERY OR TREATMENTS OR REVIEW BY N.H.S. ENGLAND HAS LOOKED IN DETAIL AT THE CARE GIVEN TO CHILDREN AND ADULTS BORN WITH HEART DISEASES BUT SEVERAL N.H.S. TRUSTS SAY THAT THEY WILL FIGHT THE DECISION
# MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED BRITISH SOLDIERS HAD TO BE STATIONED IN EASTERN EUROPE TO HELP DETER ANY POSSIBLE RUSSIAN THREAT DAVID CAMERON WILL CONFIRM THE DEPLOYMENT AT HIS LAST NATO SUMMIT AS PRIME MINISTER AND MORE THAN THIRTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTACK ON A SHIA MUSLIM HOLY SITE IN IRAQ WORSHIPPERS HAD BEEN CELEBRATING EAT WHEN A BOMB WENT OFF
# THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN MEDICINE DO YOU DELIVER IT WHERE PEOPLE WANTED TO LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY LIVE ACCESSIBLE VISIBLE TO HER LOCAL COMMUNITY WHAT DO YOU CONCENTRATED IN PLACES THERE MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO GET TO BUT WHERE THE CONSTANT DELIVERY OF HIGH QUALITY CARE ACTUALLY IMPROVES ITS QUALITY WE SEEN THE TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WHO SUFFER STROKES REALLY CHANGE IN RECENT YEARS WITH SPECIALIST CENTRES THAT YOU GET TAKEN TO RATHER THAN THE NEAREST HOSPITAL
NOW WE'RE BEING TOLD THE PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM CONGENITAL HEART CONDITIONS AND ENGLAND ARE ALSO GOING TO BE TREATED IN THE FUTURE IN FEWER PLACES THREE UNITS IN LEICESTER AND MANCHESTER AND IN LONDON ARE GOING TO CLOSE LET'S TALK FIRST TO ADAM TANSI WHOSE SON ALBERT HAS BEEN TREATED AT THE HEART UNIT AT LEICESTER'S GLENFIELD HOSPITAL THAT'S ONE OF THOSE UNITS THAT'S UNDER THREAT OF CLOSURE AND HE JOINS US ON THE LINE FROM LEICESTER GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT HAVE THEY DONE FOR YOUR SON
WELL I MEAN THEY'VE KEPT HIM ALIVE SO
I'VE BEEN IN THIS SYSTEM FOR NEARLY SEVEN YEARS HIS FIRST OPERATION WAS AT SEVEN DAYS OLD HE HAD ANOTHER ONE AT NINE MONTHS OLD BOTH OPEN HEART SURGERY HE THEN HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK WHEN HE WAS TWO AND A HALF YEARS OLD AND THEY REMOVED THE BLOCKAGE FROM ONE OF HIS ARTERIES WHICH WAS SORT OF A WORLD'S FIRST AND PROBABLY ONLY HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE WAS ADULT SERVICES AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES ON THE SAME SITE
HE WENT ON TO HAVE A HEART TRANSPLANT IN NEWCASTLE IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND SINCE THEN THEY HAVE MONITORED HIM
REGULATION OR HE'S THERE ALMOST ON A WEEKLY BASIS AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES THAT HE CONTINUES TO HAVE AND BUT WHEN HE GOES IN TO THAT HOSPITAL AND LESTER YOU ARE COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT HE IS RECEIVING RELATIVELY CLOSE TO HOME THE BEST TREATMENT THAT HE COULD
I WAS ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION OF THAT AND I DON'T THINK N.H.S. ENGLAND HAVE SAID ANYTHING ANY DIFFERENT THAT'S WHAT'S CONFUSING ABOUT THIS THAT THE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT ARE COMING OUT TO GLENFIELD ARE MUCH BETTER THAN SOME OF THE UNITS THAT ARE NOT BEING QUESTIONED AT THIS POINT I MEAN THERE'S BEEN A VERY DAMNING REPORT OVER BRISTOL YET AGAIN IN THE LAST FEW DAYS
SERVICES THERE WILL CONTINUE BOILED ACCOUNTS AS IT HAS DONE FOR MANY MANY YEARS DESPITE THE NUMBER OF DISASTERS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE HOW MUCH LOCAL SUPPORT IS
FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN AND FOR A WIDER SENSE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT HOSPITAL CARRYING ON DOING THIS WORK ISN'T IT LOOK I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE LOCAL SUPPORT FOR A LOCAL HOSPITAL BUT THE REALITY IS THIS IS ABOUT BUILDING THE STRONGEST NATIONAL SERVICE POSSIBLE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN COULDN'T UNITS AROUND THE COUNTRY ALREADY IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S ONE OF THESE IN EVERY CITY SO
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY TRAVEL INTO THIS UNIT FROM THE GREATER EAST MIDLANDS WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS THE CENTRE OF LEICESTER AND PEOPLE ARE COMING ALL THE WAY FROM THE EAST COAST ALREADY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PATIENTS IN SKEGNESS RIGHT DOWN TO SORT OF THE NORFOLK AREA ARE ALREADY COMING ACROSS THAT IS THEIR LOCAL CENTRE
SO THE TWO TO TAKE THAT OUT OF THE NATIONAL PICTURE WOULD BE RIDICULOUS ADAM TANSY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US ALL THE BEST TO YOU AND TO YOUR SON AS WELL AS TALK NOW TO JONATHAN FIELD AND WHO IS THE DEPUTY MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF N.H.S. ENGLAND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU SAY FIRST TO THE POINT THAT THE CARE THAT PEOPLE GET AT THAT HOSPITAL IN LEICESTER THAT'S THREATENED WITH CLOSURE IS OF THE VERY BEST
I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNISE THAT THERE IS EXCELLENT CARE THAT IS GOING ON THIS ISN'T ABOUT SAYING THAT THE CARE CURRENTLY AT THE CENTRES IS UNSAFE IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE QUALITY OF CARE REMAIN SAFE NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE BUT WON'T KNOW IF THEY CARRY ON DOING THE OPERATIONS AND ATTRACTING GOOD PEOPLE WHY WOULD IT NOT
FROM THE STORE YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD THAT THE CASE THAT HAS TOLD US ABOUT THAT CARE WAS BETWEEN LEICESTER BUT ALSO IN NEWCASTLE WHERE THE TRANSPLANT WAS UNDERTAKEN THE MONITORING THAT IS ONGOING
HIGHLY LIKELY TO CONTINUE WITHIN LEICESTER BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOVING THE SURGICAL CARE NOT THE MEDICAL CARE
FROM THERE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE NOW TAKEN TWO YEARS TO BRING TOGETHER THEY'VE BEEN AGREED A CLINICAL EXPERTS BY PATIENT INVOLVEMENT BEEN OUT TO CONSULTATION BEEN AGREED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS THE WAY FORWARD ARE NOW IMPLEMENT TO WHAT FRUSTRATES PEOPLE AND WHERE WE HAD IT THERE WE HAD ALSO EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF LEICESTER'S N.H.S. HOSPITAL TRUST SAYING THAT WE WE DO THIS WORK
REALLY WELL AND NOBODY INCLUDING YOU IS SUGGESTING THAT THEY DON'T DO IT WELL SO PEOPLE ARE REALLY MYSTIFIED AS TO WHY SHOULD CLOSE COS BOO COME FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU SPECIALISE AND YOU HAVE SURGEONS DOING A LOT OF OPERATIONS THAT THEY IMPROVE AT THOSE OPERATIONS OUTCOMES ARE BETTER EVERYONE'S ON BOARD WITH THAT BUT LEICESTER'S ONE OF THOSE PLACES SHE CURRENTLY LESTER DOESN'T NEED THE NUMBER OF CASELOAD THAT THIS STANDARD SUGGEST THAT HE SAYS THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TO IT AND HE ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL SOON SO THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE IS THE MINIMUM FOR NOW
AND THAT THEN INCREASES BECAUSE WE NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SURGEONS WORKING TOGETHER TO FIVE HUNDRED FOR THAT NUMBER OF CASELOAD FOR LEICESTER THAT WERE TAKEN FROM A MODELLING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ALL THE INCREASE WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE OVER THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS AH SO IT IS WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO THEN OR DID YOU JUST MAKE THIS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ALL WE HEARD EARLIER ON FROM THE PEOPLE AT LEICESTER BUT YOUR VIEW IS THAT THEY SIMPLY ARE NOT GOING TO MEET THE PROPER MINIMUM TARGET FOR THE WORK TO BE SAFELY DONE AND DONE BETTER IN THE FUTURE
IT'S THE NUMBER OF CASES NOW IT'S A NUMBER OF CASES THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE THERE IN THE FUTURE IT'S THE CO LOCATION OF OTHER SERVICES THE PAEDIATRIC SPORT IN PARTICULAR THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS THE BUSY THREE PARTS CRITICAL PARTS TO THEIR STANDARDS ARE TWO HUNDRED STANDARD SIX THEMES
BUT THE THREE CRITICAL PARTS THAT WERE LOOKING UP FOR THEIR SUMMON CASELOAD IS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PER SURGEON THAT'S GOT VERY STRONG SUPPORT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS ARE SPECIALIST SOCIETIES THE NUMBER OF SURGEONS WORKING TOGETHER SO WE MOVE TOWARDS AT LEAST THREE IF NOT THEN TO FOUR SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR HIGH QUALITY SERVICE AND THEN THE CO LOCATION OF OTHER ESSENTIAL PAEDIATRIC SERVICES THOSE TRUST THERE WE ARE SUGGESTING THAT WE'RE MOVING SPECIALIST SURGICAL CARE FROM
WE DON'T BELIEVE MEAT THAT NOW FROM ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY'VE SENT TO US AND WE'VE LOOKED AT AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THEY'LL ME MATED IN THE FUTURE HENCE NEUN TAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT GETTING HIGH QUALITY SAFE CARE FOR THE FUTURE ON A BIG REST NOW THIS GOES TO COURT
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE DISTRACTED BY LEGAL ARGUMENT BY DISTRACTING EXPERTS INTO LEGAL DISPUTES AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO ENSURE HIGH QUALITY SAFE CARE NOW BUT IMPORTANTLY INTO THE FUTURE BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT WENT TO COURT IN THE PAST THAT HOSPITAL IN LONDON THE BROMPTON AND ACTUALLY WAS OVERTURNED THE DECISION AND THAT WILL ENCOURAGE PEOPLE NOW TO THINK ACTUALLY COULD HAPPEN AS WELL WITH LESTER
I'M SURE THE PUBLIC WOULD NOT WANT THE N.H.S. TO BE PUTTING RESORTS AS IN TO LEGAL DISPUTES RATHER THAN THOSE RESOURCES INTO ENSURING THE QUALITY OF CARE NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE WE'VE HAD A VERY ROBUST PROCESS WE WERE ASKED FOR SECRETARY SOAKED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IS FOR TWO YEARS GETTING THE STANDARDS TOGETHER GOING CONSENSUS GETTING THEM CHALLENGE TO GET IN AND CONSULTED ON NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS WHICH ENSURE WE CAN IMPLEMENT THOSE STANDARDS AND HIGH QUALITY CARE NOW AND SAFELY INTO THE FUTURE
# JOHN THE FILM DEPUTY MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF N.H.S. ANGLER PACKS THANK YOU TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE HEAD TEACHERS TRYING TO PROMOTE EQUALITY AND TO PREVENT RADICALISATION OF THEIR PUPILS FACE OVERT INTIMIDATION THE CULTURE OF THE FEAR WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED IN BIRMINGHAM SCHOOLS TWO YEARS AGO STILL EXIST THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF SIR MICHAEL WILSHAW THE CHIEF OF INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND THE HEAD OF OFSTED TO WHO JOINS US FROM SALFORD THIS MORNING GOOD MORNING TO YOU SIR MICHAEL
GOOD MORNING CAN YOU GIVE US SOME SENSE OF THE SCALE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT RESISTANCE STILL GOING ON IN A HANDFUL OF SCHOOLS WHERE THERE ARE ACTIVISTS WHO IS TO JUDGE YOU TALKING OF THIS BEING A VERY WHITE PROBLEM
I'VE BEEN TO BIRMINGHAM NOW FOR SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND SPOKEN TO HEAD TEACHERS AND OTHERS IN THE EAST BIRMINGHAM AREA IN THE SO CALLED TROJAN HORSE AREA
THESE HEAD TEACHERS HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB ALONG WITH THE NEW GOVERNING BOARDS IN THE SCHOOLS TO MAKE TOO MUCH SAFER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE BUT MY CONCERN EXPRESSED AND IT'S A CONCERN AFTER HAVING SPOKEN TO THESE HEAD TO HEAD TEACHERS IS THAT IT VERY MUCH DEPENDS ON THE STRENGTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL HEAD TEACHER AND THE INDIVIDUAL COVERING BOUGHT HER BODY
WHETHER TRUE OR NOT KEPT ARE KEPT SAFE ALL OF THEM SAID TO ME WHEN I MET A GROUP OF TWELVE THIRTEEN HER TEACHER'S A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT THINGS ARE BETTER BUT THEY FEEL VERY UNSUPPORTED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WHO DO NOT MEET WITH THEM REGULARLY THEY EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT
WHEN THEY WEAR ME PROMOTE EQUALITY IN THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY WHEN THEY TRY TO WIDEN BROADENED THE CURRICULUM THEY FACED OPPOSITION FROM SOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY NOT ALL COMMUNITY THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WANT TO SUPPORT THIS CAUSE BUT THERE ARE A SMALL NUMBER WHO WERE STILL WANT TO UNDERMINE THEIR POSITION YOU WANT THE COUNCIL TO TOUGHEN UP IT HAS RELEASED A STATEMENT CLAIMING IT'S THE BEGINNING OF A THREE YEAR PLAN TO DO THIS BUT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS THIS RIGHT THAT ONE OF YOUR INSPECTORS ARE SENIOR FIGURE
SHOULD ACTUALLY PERMANENTLY BE BASED IN AREAS LIKE BIRMINGHAM TO ACTUALLY ENSURE THE COUNCIL DOING WHAT'S NECESSARY WHAT WE'VE BEEN TO BIRMINGHAM WE'VE BEEN TO BRADFORD AND WE'VE BEEN TO LUTON AND IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THEY'RE NOT TAKING THEIR SAFEGUARDING RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY PARTIS PARTICULARLY TO PIT CHILDREN FROM EXTREMISM AND RADICALISATION I'VE SUGGESTED TO MICKEY MORGAN THE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT WE SHOULD APPOINT A SENIOR
INSPECTOR HER MAJESTY'S INSPECTOR IN EACH OF THESE PREVENT REGIONS TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL AUTHORITY DO THEIR JOB PROPERLY CAN YOU HELP US REFLECTED A CHOICE OF NEXT PRIME MINISTER HE MAY RECALL THERE WAS A ROW BETWEEN THERESA MAY HOME SECRETARY ABOUT THIS SO CALLED TROJAN HORSE SCHOOLS WITH THAT ONE MICHAEL GO FEROCIOUS ROW ARE REPORTED ON ISN'T THE TIME YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO SEE HER UP CLOSE TO MAKE A JUDGEMENT ON ER JUDGEMENT WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT
DO YOU KNOW I'VE NOT SPOKEN TO THE HOME SECRETARY I OF COURSE MET WITH MICHAEL GO WHEN HE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION RADICALISATION AND EXTREMISM IS A SERIOUS ISSUE LOCAL AUTHORITIES A CHARGE OF PROTECTING CHILDREN AND WE FOUND THAT IN BIRMINGHAM THEY WEREN'T SO JOIN IT WAS GO FEMALE YOU MAY REMEMBER IT WAS A VERY I'M NOT I'M NOT
I WOULD NOT IN A POSITION TO TAKE SIDES ON THIS ONE O.K. OH THE MALES YOU'VE GOT A LOT A ROW DON'T TAKE YOUR WAY DON'T TO GO IF YOU DON'T I'VE GOT NOTHING TO SELL IT THERE'S NO POINT WAITING YOU DAMAGE THAT WILL BE INTERESTING SEE IF YOU DID HAVE A REFLECTION THERE IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT HOW ABOUT YOUR SUCCESS AT WHICH I SUSPECT YOU WILL HAVE A VIEW ON AMANDA SPELMAN HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE BUT M.P.S AFTER A HEARING WITH HER AT THE EDUCATION SELECT COMMITTEE SAY THEY CANNOT BACKER AND YET THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS SAYING I PLOUGH ON WHO'S RIGHT
WELL YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT ME TO COMMENT ON MY MY SUCCESSOR AT HOME SURE I'M SURE I'M SURE I'M SURE AMANDA WE ALL DO HAVE A VERY GOOD JOB EVERYONE WHO IS APPOINTED TO THIS THE JOBS COME COMES WITH THEIR OWN BACKGROUND THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE PERSONALITY AND STYLE I'M SURE AMANDA WILL BE DIFFERENT TO ME BUT THAT'S NO BAD THING TO MICHAEL WILSHAW THANK
# THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE AMONG THE TARGETS OF THE CHOKE UP TO REPORT WHERE THE BOSSES OF THE SECURITY SERVICES WHO ALLOWED THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING TO BE USED IN THE WAY THAT IT WAS AND CRUCIALLY PERHAPS DIDN'T INFORM THE POLITICIANS DIDN'T INDEED INFORMED THE PRIME MINISTER WHEN WHAT THEY WERE HEARING CHANGED IN TONE LET'S TALK TO FRANK GARDNER OUR SECURITY CORRESPONDENT A BIG FOCUS FRANK ON SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE THOUGH THEN BOSS OF M.I.SIX
YES THUMB IN THE BUCK STOPS I THINK PRETTY MUCH WITH HIM AND WITH HIS SERVICE MENTIONED THE SECURITY SERVICES BUT IT WASN'T M.I.FIVE IT WAS MY SIX THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR I THINK THE WORST INTELLIGENCE FAILURE OF OUR TIME AND
GO TRAWLING THROUGH THE TRANSCRIPTS A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE CHILCOT INQUIRY YOU COME ACROSS HERE TRANSCRIPTS OF WHAT SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE TOLD A LOT OF IT IS BLACKED OUT IS REDACTED IS FRANKIE LOOKING AT LOOKING AT THE HEIGHT OF A ZEBRA YOU KNOW SO MANY BLACK STRIPES ON IT BUT YOU DO GET AN IMPRESSION FOR THIS AT THE ENORMOUS PRESSURES THEY WERE UNDER AND THE SHORT CUTS THAT WERE TAKEN HE SAYS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE DEPLOYED
TO DEAL WITH THE IRAQ ISSUE THE WORK THE HOURS THEY WORKED WERE COMPLETELY ABOMINABLE THEY WERE WORKING TWENTY A DAYS THEY RAN OUT OF AIR ABYSS THEY HAD MORE TRAINED ARABIST THAN THE FOREIGN OFFICE BUT THEY RAN OUT
FURTHER ON THERE'S AN UNNAMED S.A.S. M.I.SIX OFFICER WHO'S JUST CALLED S.A.S. TO HE SAYS I THINK WE WERE WE WERE SHOWING SIGNS OF STRETCH THERE WERE CONCERNS THAT SOME OF THE NEWER MATERIAL WAS SO TO SPEAK HAD BEEN TORN OFF THE TELEPRINTER AND RUSHED ACROSS TO NUMBER TEN WITH SHALL WE SAY A LITTLE MORE HASTE THE MOST
APPROPRIATE AS PUTTING A MORALLY THAT'S THE QUALITY OF THE STUFF THAT IS COMING IN AND BEING PASSED ON TO NUMBER TEN AND THE OTHER THING THAT REALLY STRUCK A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKING AT CHILCO HAD IS THAT THE WHEN THINGS CHANGED AND IN PARTICULAR WHEN A SINGLE SOURCE
WAS REVEALED TO BE ALMOST CERTAINLY ALIVE WHO HAD BEEN TELLING LIES FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THAT WASN'T PASSED ON TO THE PRIME MINISTER IT'S IT'S UNFORGIVABLE A LOT OF FUSS WAS MADE ABOUT IT WHEN HE WAS DISCOVERED SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE PERSONALLY DROVE OVER TO NUMBER TEN TO GO AND BRIEF TONY BLAIR IN PERSON SAYING WE'VE GOT THIS NEW AND VERY EXCITING SAUCE
AND YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN HE WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN TELLING PORKIES IT WAS THOUGHT OF PEOPLE KEPT RATHER QUIET ABOUT IT FOR FAR TOO LONG BY THEN THOUGH THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE WE'VE GONE TO WAR WE HAD INVADED THE MESS UP HAD ALREADY STARTED
FUNDAMENTALLY THE PROBLEM WAS A LACK OF CHECKS AND BALANCES AND THE QUESTION WHICH I THINK NEEDS TO BE A SAINT WHICH PEOPLE IN WHITE WILL SAY CAN BE ANSWERED IS HAVE THEY LEARNT THEIR LESSONS OTHERS SUFFICIENT BALANCES AND DISTANCE PUT IN BETWEEN
THE PEOPLE WHO GATHER THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE PEOPLE WHO ASSESS IT AND THEN IN TURN THE PEOPLE WHO ASSESS IT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE POLICY AND OTHER
WELL PEOPLE ARE WHITE AUGHT SIR YES THERE IS NOW SO IF YOU LOOK AT M. I. SIX FOR EXAMPLE THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GATHERING US BASICALLY SPYING ON A FOREIGN ENEMIES THEY HAVE
THREE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS THEY HAVE THEIR TARGETING OFFICERS THAT MEANS CHOOSING PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT TO TRY AND CONVERT INTO AGENTS WHETHER SOMEBODY INSIDE ICE'S SAW IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAMME OR NORTH KOREAN DEFECTOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU HAVE THE CASE OFFICER WHOSE JOB IT IS TO ACTUALLY GAIN CHARMAN WHOO THAT THAT PERSON AND TURN THEM INTO A SAUCE INTO AN AGENT AND THEN THAT CASE OFFICER SUPPLIES THE MATERIAL TO REPORTS OFFICER WHO WILL CHALLENGE IT AND ASKED TOUGH QUESTIONS SHOULD DO AND SAY MAY THROW THAT I'M NOT IMPRESSED WITH THAT AND GO BACK TO YOUR SAUCE AND
BASICALLY TRY AND GET THEM TO PROVE IT HE THEN HAS TO THEN MAKE HIS OWN ASSESSMENT WHICH GOES UP TO THE JOINT INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS INSIDE WHITEHALL AND THEY WILL THEN MAKE THEIR OWN ASSESSMENT OF IT
IN THE ROCK RUN UP TO THE IRAQ WAR THOSE PROCESSES EXISTED BUT WERE BEING IGNORED THEY WERE BEING OVERRUN BY THE SHEER RUSH TO TO PROVIDE INFORMATION IN A HUGE RUSH PROVIDE INTELLIGENCE IT WASN'T PROPERLY TESTED AND THAT'S WHERE THEY CAME DOWN
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY MISTAKES LIKE THIS AGAIN BUT CERTAINLY NOT ON THAT SCALE THEY DO MAKE MISTAKES
THERE WAS THAT THERE WAS A CASE NOT THAT LONG AGO WHEN IT TURNED OUT THAT M.I.SIX HAVE BEEN PAYING SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SOMEBODY THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A HIGHLY PLACED TALIBAN NEGOTIATOR AND IT WAS A PAKISTANI GROCER FRANK THANKS
# YOU DID PAUSE OFF TO HEREFORD TO HIT THIRTEEN IT'S TONIGHT WHO WITH A SELECT GROUP OF PEOPLE ALL CHOOSE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER WHAT DO TORY PARTY MEMBERS THINK AND BELIEVE IN THE MODERN ERA A LOT OF COURSE HINGES ON THOSE QUESTIONS FOR THERESA MAY FOR ANDREA LEAD SOME FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE A REPORTER BOB WALKER HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO CONSERVATIVE CLUB MEMBERS IN HUCKNALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE
THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED THE THATCHER ROOM WHERE WE HAVE OUR LOCAL BRANCH MEETINGS THERE'S A BIG PORTRAIT OF MARGARET THATCHER BUT ALSO OTHER LEADERS WILLIAM HAGUE JOHN MAJOR I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE PHOTOS ARE FROM AFTER ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY THE GLORY YEARS
BRADLEY I'M A LOCAL COUNCILLOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOOK NO CONSERVATIVES ON CARNIVAL FOR MORE OF THE SAME TO BE HONEST I THINK THAT IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS I THINK THE ECONOMY IS BACK ON ITS FEET I THINK WE'RE GOING IN A GOOD DIRECTION AND ACTUALLY AS MUCH AS OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE REFERENDUM AND COMING OUT OF EUROPE I THINK THE SAFE PAIR OF HANDS AND THE EXPERIENCE HAD IS WHAT WE NEED SO I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THERESE AND I'M A FARMER DAVID CAMERON I'M THAT GUTTED HE'S GOING TO BE HONEST AND I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE IN THE SAME TIME SO I THINK TO HIS MOST WANT TO DO
MY NAME'S CAROLINE HOLMES BAMFORTH AND I'M A PROFESSIONAL CLUB SINGER SO I DO ME A LOT OF NORMAL PEOPLE IN THE WORKING MEN'S CLUBS I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY GOOD CHANGE TO HAVE A FEMALE IN CHARGE AND YOUR CHOICE TERESA MAY WHY
I THINK SHE'S A VERY STRONG WILLED LADY I THINK SHE CAN BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AS A WHOLE I FEEL SHE'S GOT A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL SPEAK TO ALSO BELIEVED THAT SHALL BE A VERY STRONG PRIME MINISTER IF SHE SUCCEEDS GRANT HOPKINSON I WORK IN A FAMILY BUSINESS SAY TILE SHOP IN HOT
I THINK AFTER THE REFERENDUM WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING FOR A FRESH DIRECTION CONSIDER IN THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE HAS BEEN TURNED ON ITS HEAD I THINK WE KIND OF NEED SOMEONE WHICH IS ABDICATING TO LEAVE YOU AT THE WAY ANDREW ELAPSE AND FOR ME AS I'VE SEEN THE CANDIDATES IN VARIOUS INTERVIEWS MORE AND MORE DRAWN TO I DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH INTO
ABOUT YOU MORE IN TOUCH WITH THE COMMON BOAT IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT FROM HER BACKGROUND AND I THINK SHE COULD PROBABLY CONNECT WITH MOST IN THE COUNTRY FOR MY NAME'S DEAN BAMFORTH MATURE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTANT THAT'S YOUR CHOICE
TREAT ME WITH THE RECENT PEOPLE BOTH FROM THE REFERENDUM DAVID BECOMES RESIGNATION BUT POLITICS IN GENERAL I THINK WE JUST NEED SOME SOLIDITY AND I THINK THREE MAY OR OFFERS THAT
SOME VOICES THEY'RE FROM HUBBLE IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE TIMBALE WAS LISTENING TO THAT HE'S PROFESSOR OF POLITICS AT QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND HAS BEEN WORKING ON SOMETHING CALLED THE PARTY MEMBERS PROJECT ALSO A LISTENING AT LISA MARCO WHO WAS UNTIL RECENTLY EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY NEWSPAPER PROFESSOR BELT STARTING WITH YOU YOU STUDY THE MEMBERS GIVE US A PEN PORTRAIT WHAT IS A TYPICAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY MEMBERS MEMBER THESE DAYS
WELL TICKLE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MEMBER IS ACTUALLY QUITE ELDERLY AROUND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE MEMBERS THAT WE SURVEY JUST AFTER THE GENERAL ELECTION IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AGED SIXTY AND OVER THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONSERVATIVE PARTY MEMBERS ALSO LIVE IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND INCLUDING LONDON SO THAT WILL BE AROUND SIXTY PERCENT OF THEM LIVE IN THAT REGION
WHICH IS ACTUALLY QUITE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MEMBERSHIP'S STRENGTH IS SEATS WHERE CONSERVATIVE PARTY M. P. SIT AND THAT MEANS THAT THE M.P.S I THINK ARE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE QUITE A LOT OF INFLUENCE OVER OVER THOSE MEMBERS THEY ALSO READ THE KIND OF NEWSPAPERS THAT YOU EXPECT THEM TO READ THE MOST READ NEWSPAPER IS THE TELEGRAPH THE TIMES
THEN THE MALE NOT SO MANY OF THEM READ THE SUN OR THE MORE POPULAR TABLOIDS IF YOU LIKE STRIKINGLY LET IN THREE PER CENT IN YOUR SURVEY READ THE SUN STRIKING FOR THIS REASON THE SUN IS CLEARLY VERY INFLUENTIAL WITH PEOPLE HE VOTE TORY OR POTENTIALLY INFLUENTIAL BUT SEEMS TO MATTER VERY LITTLE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TORY MEANT I THINK SO AND THAT IS BECAUSE
TORY MEMBERS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY MIDDLE CLASS SO IF YOU USE THE COMMON CATEGORISATION A. B. C. ONE FOR MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE AROUND EIGHT OUT OF TEN CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS WOULD FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY SO IT'S PROBABLY TO DO WITH WITH THEIR THEIR CLASS AND TO SOME EXTENT THEIR EDUCATION NOW THESE THIS BACKGROUND THAT YOU PAINT OLDER IN THE SOUTH FOR TOM DID YOU REALLY TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR VIEWS AND WHETHER THEY WILL CHOOSE A CANDIDATE BASED ON WHO THEY AGREE
OR AS WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THAT REPORT ON THE BASIS OF THOSE THEY THINK A ELECTABLE OR SOLID OR MATURE I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT YOU CAN'T SIMPLY READ OFF PEOPLE'S VIEWS FROM DEMOGRAPHICS BUT WE ALSO ASK OF COURSE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT THEIR IDEAS
THEY ARE VERY SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE IT HAS TO BE SAID THE MORE SO AS THEY GET OLDER BUT THEY DO BELIEVE FOR EXAMPLE IN AND STIFFER SENTENCES THEY DO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE TAUGHT RESPECT IT'S QUITE A NUMBER OF THEM ARE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE BUT NOT AS MANY AS YOU MIGHT THINK ACTUALLY AND THAT REALLY DOES SPLIT ALONG AGE LINES O.K. LET ME BRING IN LISA MARK TO THAT
ALL THE PAPERS EVERY SINGLE FROM PAGE WE TOO WERE FOCUSED ON NOT THE CHOICE OF POLICIES BUT ON THE FACT IT IS TWO WOMEN WHICH IS A MOMENT IN HISTORY IS IT NOT TWO WOMEN RUNNING AGAINST EACH OTHER
BUT IS THAT WHAT SIGNIFICANT AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED WE'RE GOOD MORNING I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT ONLY IN THAT IT ACTUALLY TAKES AWAY ONE OF THE EXPECTED NARRATIVES IN AND HE WAS GOING TO RUN NEXT IF IT WAS A MAN AGAINST A WOMAN THAT WOULD BE PITTED IN A WAY WHICH I THINK MIGHT BE RATHER AGGRESSIVE IN FACT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS BECAUSE IT'S A WOMAN AGAINST A WOMAN THAT TAKES AWAY THAT WHOLE STREAM OF YOU NO CHILDREN OR SHOES OR ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND ACTUALLY I THINK THE FOCUS COULD BE
AS LONG AS WE WE WE TAKE THAT NARRATIVE IS MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON THE POLICIES ARE YOU SURE BECAUSE I READ IN THE MAIL ON SUNDAY THERESA MAY DOING SOMETHING SHE'S NEVER BEEN WILLING TO DO BEFORE ALL TALKING ABOUT WHY SHE DIDN'T HAVE CHILDREN
I HEAR ANDREA LEAD SOME A FORMAL CODE WE ALL UNDERSTAND REPEATEDLY REFERRING TO HER FAMILY HER CHILDREN HER GRANDCHILDREN WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WOMEN ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF STICKING THE KNIFE INTO EACH OTHER POLITICALLY JUST AS MUCH AS MAD ON THE WELL OF COURSE THEY ARE BUT IT YE I SUPPOSE WHAT I THINK ABOUT AS A WOMAN WHO'S BEEN AT OF TEAM LEADER IF YOU LIKE IS THAT WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS TO BE JUDGED ON
THOSE SORTS OF ISSUES AGAINST SOMEONE WHO MIGHT NOT BE FACING THINKING ARE WE ONE OF THE MOST IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT CHILDREN AND FAMILY ONE THING THAT WOMEN AND INPUT POSITIONS OF POWER ARE CONSTANTLY TOLD US CAN THEY HAVE A PROPER WORK LIFE BALANCE MEN DON'T GET ASKED THAT MEN WHO TALK ABOUT THIS WELL I THINK WE SHOULD ASK IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND ASK THERESA MAY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SHE'S HER CHILDREN THAN SHE DOES ALL MALE POLITICIANS THIS SAME QUESTIONS IN THE NEXT CONTEST MAYBE IT WILL HAVE TO BE ONE WORD I'M AFRAID PROFESSOR BAIL SIMPLE ONE WHO'S GOING TO WIN
MAY YOUR OH I SAID ONE WORD AND YOU COULD SO CONFIDENT HE SAID YOUR ONE WORD MAY
# THAT WE ARE FOR IT MAYBE LED TO HIM OF COURSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOTH THANK YOU ARE TIMES SIX MINUTES TO NINE A PETITION IS GOING TO BE SUBMITTED TODAY SIGNED BY OVER A THOUSAND VETS AND CALLING ON THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF VETS TO BLACKLIST HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENTS
FOR ANIMALS MARK ELLIOTT HE'S VICE PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION OF HOMEOPATHIC VETS AND IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND YOU'RE UPSET AND I DID WELL TO BE HONEST THIS DEBATE HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR MANY YEARS THE SAME DEBATE WAS PUT TO THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION TWO YEARS AGO AND THEY COMPREHENSIVELY REJECTED THE SORT THIS SORT OF PETITION BECAUSE THERE WERE CERTAIN THE EVIDENCE FOR HOMEOPATHY
AND THEY FELT THEY COULDN'T BAN HOMEOPATHY WHEN THE EVIDENCE FOR THEIR OWN PRACTICES WORDS PRETTY SKETCHY AT BEST HOMEOPATHY IS USED BY OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE IT'S WIDELY USED IN OTHER COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY BY VETS AS WELL AND I USE EVERY DAY MY PRACTICE POINT IS WITH THE PEOPLE THOUGH THERE'S A PLACEBO EFFECT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IT MIGHT HAVE AN EFFECT IT MIGHT HAVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT BUT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT IT COULD WORK IN HERE THAT ALL THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE
MUST BE THAT IT CAN'T AND IN THOSE CONDITIONS WHERE AN ANIMAL CAN'T FEEL A PLACEBO EFFECT IS WRONG ISN'T IT TO GIVE IT TO THEM AND NOT AT ALL NO THE INITIAL EFFECT THE REASON PERHAPS WAY WERE ATTACKED AS THOSE SPECS YOU PRACTISING UP THESE BECAUSE WE DO GET RESULTS AND WE'RE OBVIOUSLY DENYING THE PLACEBO EFFECT WE'VE PUBLISHERS' ASSOCIATION A NUMBER OF CLINICAL PAPERS ONE OF THE SOME OF THE LARGEST COHORT STUDIES EVER PUBLISHED AND SOME OF THOSE WERE PUBLISHED IN THE U.K. IS VETERINARY RECORD
AND IF THERE IS THERE'S A WIDE EVIDENCE BASE FOR HOMEOPATHY IS JUST IGNORED BY ITS DETRACTORS ALL RIGHT MARC ELLIOTT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LES TURNED TO DANNY CHAMBERS WHO IS THE VET WHO STARTED THIS PETITION IS WITH ME NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU THE MORNING SHE SAID IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT YOU HAVE EVER SEEN THAT HOMEOPATHY CAN WORK IN VETS OR PETE
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION EMMA IS A HOMEOPATHY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN PART OF OUR CULTURE FOR A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS THAT HAS BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY AND ALL THE GOOD QUALITY STUDIES WHICH HAVE BEEN PERFORMED MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISEASES OVER MANY YEARS MAINLY IN HUMAN PATIENTS NONE OF THE GOOD QUALITY STUDIES HAVE MANAGED TO SHOW THAT IT HAS ANY EFFECT WHATSOEVER
AND THAT'S BECAUSE A HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE ALMOST BY DEFINITION DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN IT THAT'S EXACTLY IT I MEAN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT CLEARER TALKING ABOUT HOMEOPATHY OR NOT HANDLED HERBAL MASEN OTHER TYPES OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES AND THIS IS THE BELIEF THAT A SOLUTION HOW THE ACT OF SUBSTANCE HAS BEEN DILUTED SO MUCH THERE'S NOT A SINGLE MOLECULE LEFT AND THAT SOMEHOW HELPS THE BODY HEAL ITSELF
AND THAT EVENT SCIENTIFICALLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER AND THE TRIAL SHOWED AS WELL AND THE POINT IS THERE MIGHT BE SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING WELL I USE AND IT WORKS FOR ME BUT BUT YOUR POINT WILL BE WELL THAT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL THING THAT A HUMAN MIGHT FEEL BUT AN ANIMAL CLINIC UP YES EXACTLY RIGHTS HAVE BEEN PEOPLE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN TREATED THEY'RE HOPING THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL BETTER
AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF BEING TREATED HER THERE BUT ANIMALS DON'T KNOW THE RECEIVING TREATMENT I MEAN FOR ME THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A TREATABLE DISEASE IN AN ANIMAL OR HUMAN BUT FOR INSTANCE THAT HYPERTHYROIDISM A CAT CUSHING'S DISEASE AND A HORSE VERY COMMON DISEASES AND OLDER ANIMALS IF THEY THERE ARE DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN AND LICENCE TO WORK
AND IN THOSE CONDITIONS YOU'D EXPECT THOSE ANIMALS TO GO ON AND HAVE MANY YEARS OF HEALTHY LIFE AHEAD OF THEM AND IF YOU GIVE HOMEOPATHY INSTEAD OF A PROVEN TREATMENT YOU EFFECTIVELY WITHHOLDING TREATMENTS AND THAT THAT'S WHERE I HAVE A REAL ISSUE WITH IT SO YOU'RE CONVINCED THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY HARM IS BEING DONE TO UNLEVEL SUFFERING CAUSE
BY THE CONTINUED PRESCRIPTION OF HOMEOPATHIC REMEDY YES DEFINITELY I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING MORE UPSETTING THAN HAVING TO PUT AN ANIMAL TO SLEEP BECAUSE THE OWNER OVER DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE TREATED THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT BUT IT'S EVEN MORE UPSETTING WHEN THE OWNER WAS HAPPY TO GET TREATMENT HAPPY TO PAY FOR IT AND HAD THE MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT HOMEOPATHY WOULD HELP AND I THINK THAT BEING PROMOTED BY
A VETERINARY SURGEONS AS IS UNETHICAL THAT'S IT'S GOING TO BE MISUSING OWNERS LIMITED FINANCIAL THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS A BIG BUDGET AND IF THEY SPEND ON HOMEOPATHY THEY'RE SIMPLY WASTING IT AND ANIMAL WELFARE IS AT RISK I BLACKLIST IN THERE THE INTRODUCTION OF DID INDIA YOU LOOKING ACTUALLY FOR A BAD IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF VETERINARY SURGEONS TO IMPOSE
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE AND I THINK THEY WOULD BE VERY AN APPROPRIATE STEP BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS WRONG THAT IN A MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS INCLUDING DOCTORS AND THAT'S ALLOWED TO GIVE SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN TERM PHATIC NOT TO WORK AND YOUR CHANCE OF GETTING IT I'LL BE SPEAKING TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF VETERINARY SURGEONS LATER TODAY AND PUT IN THESE I AND THERE ARE SOME VETS WHO WILL DISAGREE WITH IT AND WE JUST HAVE A MUM
YES SOME TOPLESS WHO DISAGREE WITH THEM THERE'S ALWAYS SOME PEOPLE WHO WHO DON'T ACCEPT IT YOU HAVE SCIENTIFIC WISDOM ALSO SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN'T LIKE IT PEOPLE WHO DON'T ACCEPT SCIENCE THAN CHAMBERS THANKS THAT'S ALL FROM US TODAY OUR EDITOR'S WORD JOEL MALLS AND TRACY RUBINSTEIN GOOD MORNING
