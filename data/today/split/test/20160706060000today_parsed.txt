WE WON'T KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY IN THAT THE OUTCOME UNTIL SEPTEMBER THE NIGHT ONLY I CAN UNITE THE COUNTRY QUITE FROM HAND THE TELEGRAPH AFTER HER GETTING ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE VOTES IN THE FIRST ROUND FIRST BLOOD TO THERESA AND THAT IS THE DAILY MAIL ALTHOUGH THEY MAKE THE POINT THAT PICKED UP BY A NUMBER OF PAPERS IS THERE A PLOT TO SABOTAGE ANDREA LEAD SOME SECOND PLACE COS SHE CAME IN SECOND AND ALL THE PAPERS NOT SURPRISINGLY PICK UP ON KEN CLARKE'S COMMENTS YESTERDAY
THE GUARDIAN HAS THEM ACROSS ITS FRONT PAGE MICHAEL GO FOR IT WAS HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT MICHAEL GO WITH MICHAEL GAVE AS PRIME MINISTER WOULD GO TO WAR WITH AT LEAST THREE COUNTRIES AT ONCE AND HE LETS THEM SO LONG AS YOU UNDERSTAND SHE'S NOT TO DELIVER ON SOME OF THE EXTREMELY STUPID THINGS SHE'S BEEN SAYING AND HAVE THERESA MAY THERESA IS A BLOODY DIFFICULT WOMAN BUT YOU AND I WORKED WITH MARGARET THATCHER AND THEN THAT BLOODY DIFFICULT WOMAN PHRASE WAS TRENDING ON TWITTER YESTERDAY AS MANY WOMEN WERE JOINING UP WANTING THE BADGE AND T. SHIRT TO APPLY TO THEM TOO
# THE TIMES HAD A STORY ON ITS FRONT PAGE ABOUT DIESEL CARS IT'S AS DRIVERS OR DIESEL CARS FACE THE WORLD'S TOUGHEST AIR POLLUTION PENALTIES UNDER PLANS FOR LONDON THAT COULD BE EXTENDED TO OTHER CITIES ARE TEN POUNDS A DAY TOXICITY CHARGE WILL BE IMPOSED NEXT YEAR ON PETROL AND DIESEL CARS AND BANDS MADE BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE ENTERING CENTRAL LONDON ON THIS WILL BE ADDED TO THE ELEVEN POUND FIFTY CONGESTION CHARGE THAT'S WHAT SO HE CAN'T THE MAYOR OF LONDON SAID

# IT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO WIN TONIGHT THE MIRROR HAS A STORY ABOUT CHILCOTT ALL THE PAPERS HAVE STORIES ABOUT YOU'VE GOT THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOING TO LEAD AT THE LEAVES ON IT AND IT'S HEADLINE IS JUDGEMENT DAY BERLIN BRACED FOR BLISTERING ATTACK IN IRAQ WAR REPORT LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT REPORT TO OUR MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BOWEN WHO IS IN BAGHDAD AND JEREMY
THE EFFECT OF THE WAR PUT ASIDE ALL THE REST OF THE ROOM AND AT THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON IRAQ HAS BEEN WHAT WHAT'S THE WORD YOU USE
CATASTROPHIC AS QUITE A GOOD ONE RIGHT IRAQ IS IN A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE STATE AND JUST IN THE LAST YEAR SINCE YESTERDAY EVENING THE THE DEATH TOLL FOR THAT BOMB ON SUNDAY MORNING HAS GONE UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH MINISTRY HERE WHICH MAKES IT AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THE BIGGEST SINGLE BALL
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE SINCE ALL OF THIS STARTED NOW IRAQ WAS IN A BAD STATE BEFORE THE INVASION BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS JUST OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT IT GOT A LOT WORSE AS A RESULT OF IT
AND THE EFFECT ON THE MIDDLE EAST AS A WHOLE
WELL THE CONTAGION FROM IRAQ HAS BEEN EXPORTED AND THE YOU KNOW THE MIDDLE EAST AS WELL KNOWN TO BE DIFFICULT
CHAOTIC AT TIMES REGION BUT THERE ARE SOME FACTORS IN THE WAY THINGS ARE IN THE WIDER MIDDLE EAST THAT YOU CAN LINK BACK NOT WHOLLY BUT TO ARE QUITE A LARGE DEGREE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN IRAQ SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THE
THE RE IGNITION OF THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEAR OLD SHEARS SONY ARGUMENT WHICH HAS TURNED INTO SECTARIAN WAR NOT REALLY ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS BUT MORE I THINK BECAUSE AND SCRUPULOUS LEADERS HAVE USED IT AS A WAY OF OF SEIZING KEEPING MAINTAINING
AND ALSO THE IMPACT OF THE JIHADIST GROUPS THERE WERE NO JIHADISTS TO SPEAK OF IN IRAQ BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE IN THE CHAOS THAT FOLLOWED WHEN THE COALITION TROOPS WEREN'T ABLE TO POLICE THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY THEY DISSOLVE THE AMERICAS DISSOLVED THE IRAQI ARMED FORCES AND BASICALLY TOOK DOWN THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT AND THE WHOLE PLACE WAS A VACUUM A LOT OF JIHADISTS CAME IN HERE
AND THEY FORMED A KINDER IN IRAQ WHICH GUESS WHAT IS NOW CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND WE ALL KNOW THE WAY THAT THAT HAS EXPORTED ITS OPERATIONS WERE PRETTY MUCH WORLDWIDE JEREMY MANY THANKS
# IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX WALES FACED PORTUGAL IN THE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN SEMI FINALS TONIGHT THE FIRST TIME THE FOOTBALL TEAM TEAMS REACHED THE LAST FOUR IN A MAJOR TOURNAMENT WHEN THEY SURPRISE WELSH FANS WERE IN BUOYANT MOOD AHEAD OR HEAD OF THE MATCH IN LYON LAST NIGHT
OH YEAH OVER THE MOON I WAS HAPPY TO GO HOME AT THE GROUP STAGES
IF YOU WEREN'T SO I DID EVER SINCE NOW PART OF THE TEAM I JUST SPENT ALL MY LIFE SAVINGS WITH HAIRY PANINI WE DIDN'T EXPECT TO GET SO FAR DO YOU BELIEVE THIS
WOULD EVER HAPPEN ARE YOU CRAZY NOW ABSOLUTE UP BUT NOW WE'RE HERE WE HATE TO SAY AS WELL AS WE WILL WITH THERE'S A POLICE WE CAN GO ON THE WAY
AND WE'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED THAT BEFORE IF A SPORTS CORRESPONDENT ALEX CAPSTICK SCUSE ME JOINS US FROM THE HONOUR AND ALEX ARE MANY WELSH PEOPLE OUT THERE FOR THE MATCH TONIGHT
THERE ARE FAR MORE WELSH PEOPLE THAN THERE ARE PORTUGUESE FANS HERE IN LYON BUT NOT AS MANY AS YOU MIGHT PERHAPS THINK A FEW OF THEM WERE SAYING THAT SOME OF THEIR FRIENDS HAVE DECIDED TO STAY AT HOME THEY WERE CONFIDENT OF REACHING THE FINALS OF THE SAVING THE LAST OF THEIR MONEY
TO WATCH FRIENDS IN THE FINAL ON SUNDAY IN PARIS AT LEAST THAT'S WELL BUT THOSE THAT ARE HERE ARE REALLY ENJOYING THE ATMOSPHERE REALLY REALLY PLEASED TO BE HERE DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD BE EXPECTED YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE THERE ON THE STREETS OF LIAM ARE REALLY GETTING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND THEY THINK THEY REALLY BELIEVE THAT WHEN THEY PLAY TODAY WHEN THEY PLAYED PORTUGAL THEIR TEAM DO HAVE A CHANCE O.K. WELL HOW MUCH OF A CHANCE REALISTICALLY
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TEAM IN WALES AT HAVE SURPRISED EVERYBODY BUT THEY PLAYED REALLY REALLY WELL THE TEAM IS MADE UP ABOUT HALF THE SQUAD PLAY IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE WE LOOK AT THE PORTUGUESE TEAM ALMOST ALL OF THEIR SQUAD PLAYED THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE REGULARS LIKE BY A MUNICH LIKE A REAL MADRID THERE A GOOD TEAM BUT THEY HAVEN'T PLAYED ONE AT THIS TOURNAMENT
SO FAR THEY'VE ONLY WERE ONE GAME AT ONE NIL AGAINST CROATIA AND THAT WAS IN EXTRA TIME THEY DREW ALL OF THEIR GROUP MATCHES THEY PORT POLAND ON PENALTIES IN THE QUARTER FINALS THEY JUST HAVEN'T PLAYED VERY WELL THEY HAVE A LOOK VERY GOOD BUT THEY'VE MANAGED TO FIND A WAY THROUGH WHEREAS WALES HAVE BEEN EXHILARATING ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST MATCH WHEN THEY BEAT
A BELGIAN THREE ONCE IF SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT WHALES COULD BE THE FAVOURITES FOR THIS GAME OF COURSE WALES DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT THEY STILL CONSIDER THEMSELVES VERY MUCH THE UNDERDOGS IN THIS GAME AND IT WAS STILL WOULD BE A HUGE HUGE SURPRISE IF THEY WERE TO BE CRISTIANO RONALDO AND HIS TEAM TO GET TO THE FINAL BUT IF THEY DO IT'LL BE WHAT THE FIRST TIME A BRITISH TEAM HAS GOT INTO THE FINAL OF A MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY SIX
ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE ISN'T IT AND THE FIRST TIME WALES HAVE BEEN IN A MAJOR TOURNAMENT SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WHEN THEY LOST TO ASE BRAZIL IT'S A WONDERFUL STORY AND WHEN THEY ENTERED THIS TUNNEL WHEN THEY CAME TO THIS TOURNAMENT
CHRIS COLEMAN THE KIT BUT THE MANAGER WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY THEY LOOKED AT THEIR GROUP AND THEY THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THEY COULD GET OUT OF THE GROUP THEY THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO THE QUARTER FINALS BUT HE DID SAY IF I'M HONEST HE DIDN'T THINK THAT I'D GET TO THE SEMI FINALS BUT HE BELIEVE IN HIS PLAYERS HE SAID HE'S GOT A VERY GOOD SET OF PLAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT INTO PLACE OR HIS PLAN TO WIN THE GAME SO HE'S
WELL WELL WHAT WHERE IS HE SURPRISE THEY'VE GOT TO THE SEMI FINALS HE KNEW HE HAD A GOOD SORT OF PLAYERS AND HE KNEW THAT IF THEY COULD PUT INTO PLACE WHAT HE HIS PLAN HIS TACTICS AND THEY WOULD HAVE A CHANCE ALEX CAPSTICK THANKS VERY MUCH
# SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE POUND WAS DOWN AGAIN YESTERDAY AS THE MARKETS ARE DIGESTED THE LATEST ANNOUNCEMENT REMARK ON IT GOVERNS THE BANK OF ENGLAND DOMINIC DETAILS OF WHAT HE SAID AND HIS PLANS TO KEEP THE BANKS LENDING WHICH IS FRIGHTFULLY IMPORTANT IT CERTAINLY IS THIS JOHN STERLING TOOK A HAMMERING YESTERDAY IT WAS DOWN TO ONE DOLLAR TWENTY NINE THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN IN THIRTY ONE YEARS
MOSTLY CAUSED BY A SPEECH BY MARK CARNEY WHEN SHE MEDICALLY THE BANK OF ENGLAND WAS READY TO PRINT MORE MONEY ECONOMY I THINK WERE PROBABLY MORE ON THAT NEXT WEEK CARNEY'S IMMEDIATE MESSAGE YESTERDAY IT WAS ALL ABOUT HELPING THE BANKS TO LEND HE SAID HE WOULD LET THEM EAT INTO THEIR RAINY DAY RESERVES THE IDEAS OF THIS WILL FREE UP BILLIONS FOR NEW LENDING THIS WAS HOW HE EXPLAINED IT
IT MEANS THAT THREE QUARTERS OF U.K. BANKS ACCOUNTING FOR NINETY PERCENT OF THE STOCK OF U.K. LENDING WILL IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY HAVE GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPLY CREDIT TO U.K. HOUSEHOLDS AND FIRMS
SPECIFICALLY THE F.P.C. IS ACTION IMMEDIATELY REDUCES THE REGULATORY CAPITAL BUFFERS BY FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS AND THEREFORE RAISES THOSE BANKS CAPACITY TO LEND TO BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS BY UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION
JOINING ME IS HUGH VENTS VENUS HIT OF EUROPEAN BANKS RESEARCH AN ABYSS FROM MORGAN STANLEY HUGH WHY IS ALL THIS WHY DO WE HAVE THIS FOCUS ON THE BANK STIRLING THIS COMING DOWN AND YET MARK CARNEY SPINNING ALL THIS TIME MAKING SURE THE BANKS ARE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY WHY ARE THE BANKS ARE IMPORTANT I WOULD DOMINIC AND CONNIE WANTS TO ENSURE THAT BANKS ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM IN THE LAST CRISIS BANKS FOR THE TRANSMISSION MECHANISM OF STRESS BOTH FROM
PUT SOME OF THEIR POOR LOANS THEY WERE NOT RESILIENT ENOUGH AND OBVIOUSLY THEY TRANSFERRED SOME OF THEIR FEARS MARKETS AROUND FUNDING AS WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK THE BANKS WERE SIMPLY A MUCH BETTER SITUATION TRIPLE THE CAPITAL RATIOS FAR BETTER FUNDED LOTS OF RESERVES AND ALSO THE IMPORTANT BEEN STRESSED SO I THINK THEY'RE BETTER
BUT THIS NEW POWER GIVE THE CHANCELLOR GCS IS TO TRY AND LEAN INTO THE LEAN IN AND THEY'D LEAN AGAINST IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT IS WHY THE BANKS ARE GOING TO FALL OVER IT'S JUST THAT HE SEES THAT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY THE KEY TO THEIR CHARGE IF HE'S GOING TO GET SOME GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY ABSOLUTELY THE BOTTOM LINE AS CONNIE SAID TO TOSS YESTERDAY AS ITS LENDING DOESN'T HAPPEN HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE IT'S BECAUSE OF LACK OF DEMAND NOT BECAUSE THE BANKS HAVE ONLY GOT ANY FUCKING IN THERE IN THE PLUMBING SO WHAT HE SAID YES THEY WILL SHOULD FREE UP ANOTHER HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION POUNDS OF LIMPING ROUGHLY
IS THAT ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AND HE'S SAID THE DEMAND OUT THERE TO BORROW IT WHEN I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM I THINK OVER A MEDIUM TERM THAT'S VERY HELPFUL INITIATIVE BUT IT IS UNTESTED COS THE CHANCE WHEN HE GAVE THESE POWERS I THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT WHAT WE SEEK A MADGE IN THAT DEMAND WILL BE SOMEWHAT LACKLUSTRE OUR VIEW OF THE ECONOMY
PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS ARE SLOWING BUSINESS INVESTMENT WAS LIKE SLOW TO AND SO ACTUALLY THE BANK'S PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH CAPITAL LEND THIS IS JUST ONE EXTRA SORT OF VALVE TO TO OPEN UP TO ABSOLUTELY BEAT RAZER SURE THAT THAT THE BANKS AND WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT BRITISH BANKS BUT REALLY THEY'RE AT THAT THIS PROBLEM IS A EUROPE WIDE PROBLEM IT'S CARNAGE IN THE EUROPEAN BANKING SIP IF YOU THERE'S A MEASURE OF EUROPEAN BANKS HEALTH COULD BE EURO STOCKS AND BECS YOU HAVE STOP BANKS AND MIX IT'S HALVED IN VALUE IN THE LAST YEAR
ALL LOOK FOR ME THAT THIS IS A SEISMIC SHOCK BUT NOT A SYSTEMIC ONE I DON'T THINK BANK'S FALL OVER BUT IT CLEARS HAVING SHOCKWAVES WHETHER IT'S TO A COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE FONZ WITH US YOU CAN BANKS IT'S CLEARLY AGGRAVATED THE WEAK LINKS IN THE SYSTEM SO IN ITALY NINETEEN PERCENT OF THE LOANS FROM ITALIAN BANKS ARE SOUR AND THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS FACING A REAL DILEMMA ABOUT HOW TO REINFORCE THE CAPITAL THE BANKING SYSTEM WHICH WE DID BUT THEY DIDN'T DO ENOUGH SIZE
WITHOUT ACTUALLY CAUSING MORE DISLOCATION IT'S EVEN THE MIGHTY DEUTSCHE BANK IS IN TROUBLE ISN'T IT OF ITS SHARE PRICES HAVE THEIR LAST YEAR DEUTSCHE BANK COULDN'T INTO TROUBLE NO I DON'T PERCEIVE IT IDENTITY THAT COULD AND WHAT'S FASCINATING IF YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF FUNDING FOR DEUTSCHE BANK IT'S REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE EVEN THOUGH THE EQUITY PRICES GONE DOWN TO THE MARKET'S REALLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT ARE THE RETURNS THIS BUSINESSES DO THEY NEED TO TOP UP THE TANK WITH MORE CAPITAL BUT NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT THE RESILIENCE AND STABILITY OF THEIR BUSINESS
THANK YOU RIGHT YOU'RE MIGHT COME BACK TO YOU IN A MINUTE BUT TURNING THAT MARKETS JANE FROM RATHBONE ASSET MANAGER JANE WITH THE BIG NEWS YESTERDAY IN THE MARKET WAS AT THESE PROPERTY PHONES WHICH HAVE STOPPED AND BLISTERS TAKING MONEY OUT
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE BANKS AND THE RISKS AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE THEY PLAY COULD THESE PROPERLY FUNDS BE ANOTHER SYSTEMIC THRIP BUT WE HAVE A LOOK FOR HIM HE'S COMING UP TO BLINDSIDE OR STEPHEN I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF
PROPERTY COMPANIES WHOSE SHARES ARE FREELY TRADED AT PROPERTY INVESTMENT TRUSTS WHO SHARES HER STILL FREELY TRADED THE ISSUE IS THAT YOU'VE GOT A FUND WRAPPED AROUND PROPERTIES WHICH ARE QUITE DIFFICULT TO SELL THAT FUND MAY HAVE TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT IN CASH WHEN PEOPLE TAKE THEIR MONEY OUT OF THEIR REMOVING MORE THAN TEN TO TWENTY PER CENT OF THE VALUE OF THAT FUND
THE FUNGI THING GETS TO A POINT WHERE IT HAS TO START TO SELL PROPERTY WHICH TAKES SOME TIME QUITE HARD TO MOVE AN OFFICE O.K. SO THEY HAVE TO CLOSE IT WHILE THEY GIVE THEMSELVES AND TIME TO SELL IT IT DOESN'T MEAN THIS DISASTER CUT EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME FROM BEING A BIT CYNICAL HERE BUT WE WERE TOLD I REMEMBER IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHEN THOSE FIRST BEAR STEARNS HEDGE FUNDS GOT TROUBLE AND I THINK SOME FRENCH BANKS AS WELL
DON'T WORRY IT'S JUST A ONE OFF THESE ARE HER LIQUID ASSETS IT'S NOT A SIGN OF A BIG PROBLEM WHAT DO YOU KNOW IT WAS SHIT THE THINK WAS THE THREAT TO THE MARKET I THINK I THINK IT'S DEEPLY UNHELPFUL SO WHAT THAT SO FAR ONE QUARTER OF ALL THE ASSETS IN THE RETAIL FUNDS ARE CLOSED IF YOU GO BACK TO GERMANY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE ROUGHLY HALF GOT CLOSED SO IT PROBABLY IS MORE TO COME I THINK THE GOOD NEWS FOR ME THOUGH IS THE BANKS ARE LESS IMPLICATED THIS TIME LAST YEAR BANKS ONLY PROVIDED ONE THIRD OF THE FUNDING TO COMMERCIAL SECTOR
IF YOU GO BACK TO PRE CRISIS IT WAS TWO THIRDS SO I THINK THE BANKS HAVE STRONGER BUT OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT INVESTORS ARE NOW SHOULDERING A LOTS OF WOBBLING FINANCIAL REGULATION WAS TO PUSH THE RISKS OUT OF THE BANKS
INTO THE INVESTORS WERE INVESTORS NOW ARE TAKING ON MORE OF THAT RISK AND I SEE THIS IS ONE CONSEQUENCE JANE WHAT'S SO WHAT'S THE MESSAGE HERE FOR FOR AVERAGE INVESTORS BUT WHO NEEDS SOME ADVICE AND IN TIMES LIKE THIS INTEREST RATE CUTS COMING WE THINK THE POUND GOING DOWN
PROPERTY ASSETS LOOKING IFFY WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE TOOK TO CLIENTS WHAT SHOULD THE AVERAGE LISTEN TO BE DOING
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME AND THAT IS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CASH TO GET YOU THROUGH THE DIFFICULT TIMES THEN YOU CAN AFFORD TO HOLD ON AS LONG AS THEY'RE GOOD QUALITY INVESTMENTS YOU SHOULD HOLD ON THE THE ISSUE ABOUT STOP MARK IS THERE THEY'RE ALWAYS VOLATILE PRICES GO UP AND DOWN AND IN TIMES OF STRESS BUT YOU SHOULD HOLD ON UNLESS YOU'RE A FORCED IF YOU'RE FORCED TO RAISE CASH WHICH IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
EXACTLY AND IF I COULD JUST THINK SIXTY FOUR ONE BREAKING STORY THAT'S COMING A FORMER FINANCIAL SERVICES OMBUDSMAN HAS HAD LAUNCHED A A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT HE SAYS AGAINST MASTERCARD OVER EIGHT FOR NINETEEN BILLION POUNDS OVER THE FEES OR CHARGES TO RETAIL
JUST TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT OF THE NOMINEE WAS RETAIL NOT MANY OF US REALISE WE GOING TO PUT A CARD IN THE MACHINE IN A SHOP THAT THE RETAILERS PAYING FOR THE PRIVILEGE THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN SOME RETAILERS DO PASS THAT ON BUT BUT NOT THAT MANY AND OF COURSE IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE DON'T SEE THERE'S NOW A CAP ON THESE CHARGES BUT OF COURSE BEFORE IT WAS IT WAS A PRETTY FREE MARKET
THANK YOU VERY MUCH JANE FROM INVESTMENT FROM RATHBONE'S INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND OF COURSE HE EVENTS FAMOUS HEAD OF EUROPEAN BANKS RESEARCH AT MORGAN STANLEY STAYING WITH PROPERTY IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS WE HAVE HAD THOSE CLOSURES OF THOSE BIG INVESTMENT FUNDS THEY WERE RUN BY STANDARD LIFE BIBA AND ENERGY THEY BUY OFFICE BLOCKS RETAIL PARKS INDUSTRIAL ESTATES BUT INVESTORS WANT HELP BECAUSE THEY FEAR THE FALLING VALUES
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS SIGHTED THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET AS ONE OF THE REST OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY SINCE THE SINK THERE HAS TAKEN AN CAPITAL FROM OVERSEAS AND HEAD BECOME IN ITS WORDS STRIPS LET'S HEAR WHAT MARK CARNEY HAD TO SAY
IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT ADJUSTMENTS IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE COULD TIGHTEN CREDIT CONDITIONS FOR U.K. BUSINESSES
FOREIGN FLOWERS OF CAPITAL INTO COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE FELL FIFTY PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN
TRANSACTION VOLUMES HAVE FALLEN FURTHER DURING THE SECOND QUARTER SHARE PRICES OF PROPERTY REET DROP SHARPLY FOLLOWING A REFERENDUM WHAT GREAT TIMING IT'S THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTE OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS TODAY THERE'LL BE A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY CONFERENCE AND WITH US IN OUR SOUTHAMPTON STUDIO IS LUCY AND COOK FROM THE PROPERTY GROUP SAMPLES HE'S THE U.K. HAD RESIDENTIAL RESEARCH
LUCY AND TELL US ARE WE HEADED FOR A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY CRASH I LOOK I THINK IT'S FAR TOO EARLY TO BE MAKING THOSE KIND OF STATEMENTS THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE OUTLOOK IS WEAKER FOR THE U.K. RESIDENTIAL MARKET AND I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM SENTIMENT IS LIKELY TO CURB HER APPETITE FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE THOSE BIG CAPITAL PURCHASES BUT IN THE LONGER TERM THIS JUST UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE
WIDER ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WILL BE AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE HOUSING MARKET I THINK CRITICALLY IMPORTANTLY IS WHAT HAPPENS TO INTEREST RATES OVER THE LONGER TERM BECAUSE THAT DICTATES THE SQUEEZE THAT YOU HAVE ON HOUSEHOLD FINANCES WHICH IS OFTEN THE MAIN DETERMINANT OF HOUSE PRICES IN THERE
CURRENTLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING BACK BASE RATES THAT COULD BE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN LENDERS MARGINS BUT CERTAINLY NOT THE SPIRALLING INTEREST RATES WHICH WOULD CAUSE FOR EXAMPLE SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF REPOSSESSION WYCHWOOD WHICH WOULD SORT OF PUSH HOUSE PRICES INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY LOOKS LIKE AS THINGS CURRENTLY STAND IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE BENIGN ANNOUNCE YOU SUNG UNCERTAINTY WERE PRETTY CLEAR WE WANT AND THIS IS INTENTIONS REALLY
CARNEY TALK ABOUT A FIFTY PERCENT DROP IN OVERSEAS INVESTMENT PROPERTY AND WE'VE HAD THESE THREE PROPERTY FUNDS HAD TO GO HAD TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS FOR WITHDRAWALS THOUGH THAT IF WE DON'T HELP HOW MUCH MORE EVIDENCE DO YOU NEED YEAH WELL LOOK I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THOSE ARE HUGELY RELEVANT TO THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY MARKET THE FUNDS THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH A MUCH MORE WEIGHTED TOWARDS COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY THE MONEY WHICH IS PUT INTO THEM IS FAR MORE
LUCE THAN THAT WHICH GOES INTO THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR WHICH CONTINUES TO BE OVERWHELMINGLY DOMINATED BY U.K. HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR INVESTMENT ATTRACTIVE IT'S A SORT OF LONDON AND THE WRIST ISSUE BUT IS IT STILL A TWO SPEED MARKET
WHAT SINKS CURRY STAND WHAT'S ANY OF THE LAST TEN YEARS IT HAS BEEN NO DOUBT ABOUT IT LONDON HOUSE PRICE GROWTH FAR OUTSTRIPPED THE REST OF THE U.K. THROUGH THE COURSE OF SINCE AROUND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HOWEVER WE'VE SEEN A HOUSE PRICE GROWTH SPREAD A BIT MORE WIDELY NONE THE LESS IT MEANS LONDON IS MUCH MORE HEAVILY PRICED COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE U.K. THAN IT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY AND IF WE SEE FOR EXAMPLE A TIGHTENING OF LENDING CRITERIA WHERE THE BANKS BECOME A BIT MORE CAUTIOUS THAN THAT
THEN FOR THEREFORE PULL BACK ON HOW MUCH THEY LAND RELATIVE TO PEOPLE'S INCOMES THAT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE A DRAG ON HOUSE PRICES IN LONDON THAN A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY YOU TALK ABOUT INTEREST RATES
DOESN'T REALLY MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE OF FRED'S GOT LOWER RORY HAD HURT AN HISTORIC CHLO DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE CONSUMERS' BEHAVIOUR THAT MUCH IF WE CUT BY ANOTHER POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT SAY WELL I'M NOT I PERSONALLY I'M NOT CONVINCED IT WOULD ACTUALLY BECAUSE I THINK EVEN IF YOU WERE TO HAVE THOSE CUTS ENRAGED AT THE PROSPECT THAT ACTUALLY LENT US MARGINS WILL GO UP AS THEY PERCEIVE THERE TO BE MORE RISK IN THE SECTOR AND THEREFORE REQUIRE MORE RETURNS BUT FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S ABOUT THE CONTINUATION OF THIS LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT
# THANK YOU VERY MUCH LUCY AND COOK FOR THE PROPERTY GROUP SETTLES THAT'S TONIC TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX NO HERE IS SLIGHTLY WITH THE SPORT GOOD MORNING WALES ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST GAME IN THEIR HISTORY A EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP SEMI FINAL AGAINST PORTUGAL OUR FOOTBALL CORRESPONDENT LOOKS AHEAD TO TODAY'S MATCH

# TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SUITE WITH A NEWT THE LONG AWAITED REPORT INTO THE IRAQ WAR WILL BE PUBLISHED THIS MORNING THE INQUIRY'S CHAIRMAN SIR JOHN CHILCOT SAID HE HOPES IT WILL ENSURE THAT MILITARY INTERVENTION ON SUCH A SCALE WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT MORE ANALYSIS AND POLITICAL JUDGEMENT SIR JOHN SAID THE REPORT WOULD CRITICISE INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS
# THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE WEEKEND SUICIDE BOMBING IN BAGHDAD HAS RISEN TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ATTACK CARRIED OUT BY THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IS THE DEADLIEST IN THE IRAQI CAPITAL SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND THREE U.S. LED INVASION
# THERESA MAY HAS SAID SHE'S THE ONLY CANDIDATE LEFT IN THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST WHO CAN UNITE THE PARTY THE HOME SECRETARY HAD A BIG LEAD IN THE FIRST ROUND OF VOTING WINNING THE SUPPORT OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE TORY M.P.S HALF THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY ANDREA LEAD SOME AND MICHAEL GO FOR THE ONLY OTHERS LEFT IN THE CONTEST AFTER LIAM FOX WAS ELIMINATED AND STEPHEN CRAB WITH DREW
# THE POUND HAS FALLEN TO HER NEW THIRTY ONE YEAR LOW AGAINST THE DOLLAR DURING TRADING IN THE FAR EAST AMID HEIGHTENED FEARS ABOUT BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION AT ONE POINT STERLING DROPPED BELOW ONE DOLLAR TWENTY EIGHT BEFORE RECOVERING SLIGHTLY
# IT'S EMERGED THAT PRISON OFFICERS HAVE STAGED UNOFFICIAL WALKOUTS AT FIVE PRISONS IN ENGLAND BECAUSE OF SAFETY FEARS THE PRISON OFFICERS' ASSOCIATION WHOSE MEMBERS ARE BANNED FROM GOING ON STRIKE SAID THEY WERE NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND ASSAULTS ON STAFF LAST YEAR THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE HAS ANNOUNCED EXTRA FUNDING OF ALMOST THIRTEEN MILLION POUNDS TO IMPROVE SAFETY IN SIXTY NINE PRISONS
# N.H.S. INSPECTORS HAVE REVEALED THAT A PATIENT LAY DEAD FOR UP TO FOUR AND A HALF HOURS AT ONE OF LONDON'S BUSIEST ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS WITHOUT BEING SPOTTED NORTH MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL TRUST SAYS THE UNIT HAD SUFFERED FROM A SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS THE CARE QUALITY COMMISSION'S REPORT SAYS THE SITUATION IS IMPROVING
# THE SOUTH AFRICAN ATHLETE OSCAR PISTORIUS IS EXPECTED TO LEARN TODAY WHETHER HE'LL GO TO JAIL FOR THE MURDER OF HIS GIRLFRIEND REEVE ESTEEM CAMP THREE YEARS AGO HE WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER ON APPEAL AND COULD NOW FACE A SENTENCE OF FIFTEEN YEARS IN JAIL
# TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IN AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM A GROUP OF JOURNALISTS WILL BE LOCKED UP ON ACTUALLY LOCKED INTO A ROOM WITH A COPY OF THE CHILCOTT REPORT AND NOT RELEASED UNTIL THE REPORT IS PUBLISHED AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ONE OF THOSE JOURNALISTS WILL BE OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT PETER HUNT AND PETER SO I SUPPOSE THE BIG QUESTION
TWO BIG QUESTIONS YOU WANT ANSWERED WE ALL WANT ANSWERED IS WAS THE WAR A LEGAL WAR AND WILL WE DECEIVED
YES I THINK WE'VE GOT A HINT OF SOME OF THE CRITICISMS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THAT REPORT IN THE WORDS THAT SIR JOHN CHILCOT GAVE IN AN INTERVIEW FOR ALL BROADCASTERS LAST NIGHT THERE'S BEEN BROADCAST THIS MORNING WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED IF WE EVER WENT TO WAR AGAIN
FOR THERE TO BE CAREFUL CHALLENGE ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTIVE POLITICAL JUDGEMENT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY PHRASES COLLECTIVE POLITICAL JUDGEMENT SO I THINK ONE CAN DRAW FROM THAT THAT THEY MAY WELL BE SOME PRETTY STRINGENT CRITICISM OF TONY BLAIR'S STYLE OF GOVERNMENT THE SO CALLED SOFA
GOVERNMENT THIS PHRASE THAT JOHN PRESCOTT USED WHEN HE CAME HERE HE SAID HE WAS ON THE SOFA ALL THE TIME AND WHAT EMERGED DURING THE IRAQ INQUIRY WAS THAT THERE WERE NO RECORDS OF KEY MEETINGS IT WASN'T CLEAR WHO WAS THERE NO PAPER ON THE WALL WAS PUT BEFORE THE CABINET IN THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE
WE WERE COMMITTED TO BATTLE AND THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY COLLECTIVELY MADE A DECISION TO FIGHT WAS JUST THREE DAYS BEFORE THE HOSTILITIES BEGAN ON THE ISSUE OF LEGALITY I MEAN THAT WILL BE REALLY INTERESTING ISSUE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY DO PASSED JUDGEMENT ON THAT NONE OF THEM IS A LAWYER A TRAINED LAWYER THEY HAVE HEARD FOR MANY INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS AND I SUSPECT RATHER LIKE
JOURNALISTS ARTISTS ARCHITECTS AND THE OTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE ECONOMISTS IF YOU GATHER SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS AND THE REMAIN THEY MAY NOT ALL ALL COME TO THE SAME AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN TIPSY WHAT JUDGEMENT THEY PASS ON THAT ON THE ISSUE OF LEGALITY THEY WILL OBVIOUSLY BE A FOCUS IN THE REPORT ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE TIME LORD GOLDSMITH BECAUSE HE DECIDED THE CONFLICT WAS LEGAL JUST THREE DAYS BEFORE THE INVASION AND AFTER MONTHS OF PERSONAL DOWN AND IF
THE REPORT FINDS THAT THE WAR WAS NOT LEGAL AS YOU SAVED IT PROBABLY UNLIKELY THAT THEY WILL DO IT AT LEAST IN THOSE START TERMS BUT IF THEY WERE TO DO THAT WOULD PEOPLE THEN BE ABLE TO USE THAT TO JUSTIFY OR ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY THE ARREST OF TONY BLAIR
MANY EMINENT LAWYERS OR SAID THEY WOULDN'T BECAUSE THEY WOULD THEY POINT TO THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT WHICH WAS MADE CLEAR THAT A DECISION TO GO TO WAR IS NOT PART OF ITS JURISDICTION AND SO WHAT MANY INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS STRESS IS THAT WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE COS OF THIS WHOLE REPORT ABOUT LESSONS TO BE LEARNT AND WHAT THEY ARGUE SUCH CAMPAIGNERS WOULD NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT HOW THE LAW CAN BE CHANGED
FOR THE FUTURE AND OF COURSE IN ALL OF THIS WHAT WOULD BE FASCINATING JEREMY CORBIN CHOOSES TO RESPOND WHEN HE'S AT P.M.Q.S THIS AFTERNOON A YEAR SO THE POLITICAL RATTRAY THINGS LIKE
WE KNOW WHAT JEREMY CORBIN HAS SAID IN THE PAST HE WAS ONE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY LABOUR M.P.S WHO WERE OPPOSED TO THE WAR HE HAS IN THE PAST SAID THAT HE WOULD WAIT TO SEE THE EVIDENCE TO PASS JUDGEMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT TONY BLAIR IS GUILTY OF A WAR CRIME SO WE'LL KNOW HIS JUDGEMENT IN A FEW HOURS' TIME PETER MANY THANKS FOR NOW
# IT'S NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN THERESA MAY THE HOME SECRETARY WAS WAY OUT AHEAD ON THE FIRST ROUND OF M.P.S VOTING NEXT ROUND IS TOMORROW NORMAN SMITH IS A ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN WITH HER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE VOTES YESTERDAY SHE PULLED MORE THAN ALL HER RIVALS PUT TOGETHER
SHE'S SHE'S NOT QUITE INVINCIBLE BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE HOW ANYONE STOPS BIGOTS TO GET WHAT FIFTY PER CENT OF THE VOTE IN A BALLET OF FIVE CONTENDERS IS A FORMIDABLE ACHIEVEMENT AND ALL THE SIGNS ARE HAVE VOTE WILL KEEP GOING UP IN THE SUBSEQUENT CONTACTS BECAUSE STEPHEN CRABB AND LIAM FOX HAVE BOTH SAID THEY'RE GOING TO BACK SO ONE IMAGINES A SIZEABLE CHUNK OF THEIR COMBINED FIFTY VOTES WILL GO TOWARDS
BUT MORE THAN THAT THERE IS WHAT I WOULD CALL THEM THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF CAREER ENHANCEMENT IN OTHER WORDS TORY M.P.S WANT TO BE ON THE WINNING SIDE IN THE HOPE THAT IF THEY ARE THE VICTORIOUS CONTENDER WILL BESTOW SOME PREFERMENT UPON THEM OF COURSE MISSUS MAY STILL HAS TO WIN IN THE COUNTRY BUT TALKING TO PEOPLE I THINK THEIR HOPE IS THAT IF SHE WINS SUCH A HUMUNGOUS MAJORITY AMONGST M.P.S
IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR CONSERVATIVE ASSOCIATIONS TO SEND BACK A CANDIDATE WHO CLEARLY DOES NOT HAVE THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF TORY M.P.S BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK ACROSS THE ISLAND THE DIFFICULTIES THE LABOUR PARTY'S IN WHERE THEY OBVIOUSLY DO YOU HAVE A LEADER WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE BACKING OF M.P.S AND SO I THINK THE HOPE OF TEA MADE IS IF THEY GET AN ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING MAJORITY THEN CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS IN THE COUNTRY WILL FALL IN BEHIND MISSUS
ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN SOME SUGGESTION THAT BECAUSE THERESA MAY'S SUPPORTERS WOULD PREFER SHE WAS UP AGAINST MICHAEL GO RATHER THAN A DRAY LEADS AND THERE MAY BE SOME TACTICAL VOTING TOMORROW YES THIS IS PUT ABOUT BY MISSUS LED SOME SUPPORTERS IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN MICHAEL GOES POSITION IS EVEN MORE DIRE THAN HIS THIRD PLACE WOULD SUGGEST I MEAN IT SEEMS TO BE MY IS REALLY GOING TO STRUGGLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH TO THE FINAL
CONTEST BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE HAS A BALL AND CHAIN AROUND HIS ANKLE WHICH FRANKLY IS BORIS JOHNSON AND
I GET THE FEELING THAT MY WHILE HE SAYS HE'S STILL IN IT TO WIN IT WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING IS ALMOST THE LAST STAND OF THE TORY MODERNISERS AND HE IS DETERMINED TO GO DOWN ALL GUNS BLAZING THIS MORNING IN AN ARTICLE IN THE TIMES
RE STATING SORT OF TORY SOCIAL REFORM AGENDA SAYING HOW THEY MUST BECOME THE PARTY MUST BECOME WARRIORS FOR THE DISPOSSESSED THEY'VE GOT TO ADDRESS ISSUES LIKE PRISON RE OFFENDING LIKE LOW EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AMONGST BROLLY WHITE WORKING CLASS CHILDREN DO SOMETHING ABOUT CHILDREN LEAVING CARE THE PROBLEM THERE IS YOU WOULD IMAGINE THAT SORT OF AGENDA WOULD APPEAL TO STEPHEN CRABBY CLEARLY HASN'T BUT MORE THAN THAT IN THESE
UNCERTAIN TIMES YOU JUST SENSE WHAT PEOPLE ARE PERHAPS LOOKING FOR HIS SECURITY CERTAINTY STABILITY NOT SORT OF FURTHER RADICAL REFORM HOWEVER NOBLE THAT MIGHT BE AND IT'S CLEAR HOW POPULAR SHE IS AMONG M.P.S
IS SHE POPULAR AMONGST THE MEMBERSHIP WELL SHE HAS APPARENTLY BENEATH THE RADAR ACTUALLY BEEN DOING AN AWFUL LOT OF CONSTITUENCY EVENTS OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS SO SHE'S CLEARLY BEEN DILIGENTLY WORKING HER WAY SHE HAS A PROFILE WHICH SHE'S UP AGAINST ANDREA LEAD SOME WILL VASTLY
OVERSHADOW WHAT MISLED SOHN OR CAN OFFER AND AS I SAY I THINK IT'S IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW MISLED SOME CAN CLAW THIS BACK ALBEIT SHE IS COMING FROM ALMOST NOWHERE AND HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED A DEGREE OF MOMENTUM
NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH NINETEEN MINUTES TO SERVE A LOCAL PAPERS AND THAT'S THE BIG STORY FOR PRETTY WELL ALL OF THEM AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT BLOOD TO THERESA THAT'S THE MAIL'S HEADLINE THE TIMES SAYS THE FINAL RUN OF PICTURES MICHAEL GOALS AND ANDREW LEADS THEM IN A BATTLE TO BECOME THE BRICKS IT CHALLENGER TO TERESA MAKE THE MIRRORS SAYS BRITAIN HAS EDGE CLOSER TO A SECOND WOMAN PRIME MINISTER
THE MAIL ASKED THAT QUESTION THOUGH IS IS THERE A PLOT TO SABOTAGE MY LEAD SOME AND ACCORDING TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES MISSUS LED SOME SUPPORTERS SUSPECT THAT SOME FIFTEEN BACKERS HAVE MISSUS MAY VOTED TACTICALLY FOR MISTER GAVE TO TRY TO ENSURE HE'S IN THE FINAL SHORTLIST IN TOMORROW'S FINAL ROUND AS THEY BELIEVE HIS TARNISHED BY HIS POLITICAL ASSASSINATION OF BORIS JOHNSON AND CAN'T WIN THEY ARE WELL MISSUS MEYER'S IN POLE POSITION WE SHALL BE ACUTELY AWARE THAT AS A REMAIN SUPPORTER SHE'S OUT OF STEP WITH THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP VOTED FOR BRECHT'S HAD IN THE REFERENDUM
IT WAS THAT IN THE PREVIOUS TWO TORY LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS CONDUCTED UNDER THE PRESENT RULES THE INITIAL FRONT RUNNERS WERE REJECTED BY THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP THE FINANCIAL TIMES AND THE GUARDIAN LEAD ON WHAT THE F. T. CALLS THE GROWING ECONOMIC FALLOUT FROM BRECK'S IT ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN CITY WATCHERS BELIEVE MORE PROPERTY FUNDS ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW STANDARD LIFE AVIVA AND M. AND G. IN SUSPENDING TRADING IT SAYS INVESTORS ARE RACING FOR THE DOOR AMID FEARS OF A PLUNGE IN THE VALUE OF OFFICE BLOCKS AND SHOPPING CENTRES
# IN POST BRECHT'S IT BRITAIN THE MAIN STORING THE EXPRESS SAYS THAT AS BRITISH POLITICIAN A STRUGGLE TO GET TO GRIPS WITH THE DECISION TO LEAVE THE E. YOU ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES BEHIND THE VOTE THE MIGRANT CRISIS IS GETTING WORSE BY THE DAY IT REPORTS THAT FIGURES BY THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION FOR MIGRATION SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ENTERING THE E.U. BY SEA SOARED BY SIXTY PERCENT IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS THE PICTURE OF TONY BLAIR COVERS MUCH OF THE MIRROR'S FRONT PAGE UNDER THE HEADLINE JUDGEMENT DAY
THE PAPER'S LEADER COLUMN DESCRIBES THE PUBLICATION OF THE CHILDREN CHILCOT INQUIRY IS A MOMENT OF TRUTH IT SAYS THE FAMILIES OF SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN KILLED IN THE IRAQ WAR DESERVE THE FULL TRUTH ABOUT THE DISASTROUS CONFLICT AND IT WILL INSULT THE MEMORY OF THE FALLEN AND DAD PAINTER GRIEVING RELATIVES IF THE ENQUIRY PULLS ITS PUNCHES AND ALL THE PAPERS LOOK AHEAD TO WHAT THE GUARDIAN CALLS THE BIGGEST GAME IN THE HISTORY OF WELSH FOOTBALL AND POSSIBLY AND WELL SPORT
# THE SUN SAYS WALES CONTINUE THEIR UNSTOPPABLE MARCH INTO TONIGHT'S EURO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEMI FINAL WITH ONLY PORTUGAL STANDING BETWEEN THEM AND THE FINAL WHEN THE WELSH TEAM WALKS ON TO THE PITCH IN LYON THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THEY WILL HAVE THE GOOD WISHES OF THE ENTIRE UNITED KINGDOM BEHIND WHERE ALL OF WELSH NOW THE PAPER DECLARES THE MIRROR HAS THIS CRIED YOU SCUM LYING AND MARIE IN OTHER WORDS
# COME ON WALES YES IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT THE LONG AWAITED CHILCOTT REPORT WHICH LOOK TO BRITAIN'S ROLE IN THE IRAQ WAR WILL BE PUBLISHED AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING CRITICISM IS EXPECTED TO BE LEVELLED AT THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR
# THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY WARNED YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT BY THE CORROSIVE EFFECTS OF SOME OF THE LANGUAGE USED DURING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN HE CALLED ON POLITICIANS NOT TO TEAR AT EACH OTHER IN THE AFTERMATH HE WAS SPEAKING ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE DEBATE IN THE LORDS ON THE REFERENDUM RESULT A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN REPORTS
LIKE MANY PEERS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY THE MOST REVEREND JUSTIN WELBY VOTED FOR THE U.K. TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. HE SAID EVENTS OF THE LAST FORTNIGHT HAD LED TO TRAUMATIC AND DYNAMIC CHANGES THE COURSE OF THE CAMP
SPACE ROBUST AS IT PROPERLY SHOULD BE ON SUCH GREAT ISSUES BUT IT TIME TO GO FOR THE LINE ON BOTH SIDES IT'S NOT MERELY BEING ROBUST BUT BEING UM EXCEPT
THROUGH THOSE COMMENTS WHERE CREATED CRACKS IN THAT THING
OF THE POP POLITENESS AND TOLERANCE OF OUR SOCIETY THROUGH WHICH SINCE THE REFERENDUM
WE HAVE SEEN AND EYE WELLING OF POISON AND HATRED THAT I CANNOT REMEMBER IN THIS COUNTRY FOR VERY MANY
AT THE START OF THE DEBATE THE LEADER OF THE LORDS LADY STOLE SAID THE NEXT TWO DAYS WOULD GIVE PIERS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER SOME CLEAR THINKING ON THE ISSUES FACING THE COUNTRY THE PUBLIC AS A WHOLE
HOWEVER THEY BOATED DESERVE
WITH A REFERENDUM RESULT THEY HAVE ASKED US TO COME TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT WORKS FOR EVERY
AND SHE SAID IT WAS A CHANCE FOR THE HOUSE OF LORDS TO SHOW WHY IT EXISTED GIVEN THAT COMMENT IT WAS HARDLY A SURPRISE WHEN THE FORMER HEAD OF THE CIVIL SERVICE AND EX CABINET SECRETARY LORD ARMSTRONG DECLARED THAT THE U.K. FACED AN EXISTENTIAL AS WELL AS A POLITICAL CRISIS AFTER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE
I DO NOT REMEMBER SUCH AN UNHOLY MESS AS WE'RE ENOUGH EXCEPT PERHAPS AFTER THE SERIES
THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PEERS LADYSMITH SAID THE GOVERNMENT HADN'T PLANNED FOR A LEAVE VOTE AND SHE COMPLAINED THAT DRAWING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN FALSE PROMISES HAD BEEN MADE ON A GIGANTIC SCALE
THE MOST OBVIOUS IS THE INSISTENCE BEFORE THE VOTE THAT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
BEFORE THAT BEEN DENIED WITHIN HOURS OF THE POLES CLAIMS
THE LIB DEM LEADER IN THE UPPER HOUSE LORD WALLIS SAID HE WAS DEVASTATED BY THE RESULTS OF THE REFERENDUM HE WAS ONE OF MANY PEERS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT TO SAY THAT E.U. NATIONALS LIVING IN THE U.K. SHOULD NOT BE USED AS BARGAINING CHIPS IN ANY FUTURE TALKS
IT'S NOT EVEN HAVE AS IF IT WAS A PRACTICAL BARGAINING POSITION
A GOVERNMENT WHICH CAN'T EVEN MANAGED TO DEPORT FORTY CRIMINALS WITH NO RIGHT TO REMAIN IT'S NOT PAID AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ALL SORT OF CAUGHT UP TO THREE MILLION YOU USE
THE CONSERVATIVE FORMER CHANCELLOR LORD LAWSON WAS THE FIRST LEAVE CAMPAIGNER TO SPEAK IN THE DEBATE HE SAID THE REFERENDUM VOTE HAD BEEN A MOMENTOUS DECISION AND HE SAID THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER HAD AN HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE UNITED KINGDOM THE MOST DYNAMIC AND FIERCE COUNTRY IN THE WHOLE OF YOU
TO FINISH IN A WORD THE JOB WHICH MARGARET THATCHER STYLE
AND TO BECOME A BEACON BEACON TO OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS CURRENTLY EMBROILED IN A FAILED AND DUDE EXPECT
THE LORDS IS PACKED FULL OF EXPERTS AND ONE OF THEM IS THE HISTORIAN AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERT LORD HENNESSEY APART FROM THE TREASURY WHICH HAD PLANS IN PLACE FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO STABILISE THE MARKET'S GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES WERE EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN TO DRAW UP CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR X.
WE MAY PRIDE OURSELVES MY LORDS ON BEING A BACK OF THE ENVELOPE NATION BUT THIS WAS EXCESSIVE
NEVER HAVE I ENCOUNTERED SO MANY PEOPLE WITH SO FEW IDEAS ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN THE FACE OF A FIRST ORDER CRISIS NEVER COMPLAINTS ABOUT A LACK OF PLANNING FOR A LEE VOTE WEREN'T RESTRICTED TO THE LORDS HOW MUCH IS IT AN ACT OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE THAT THIS PLANNING HAS NOT BEEN THIS CONTINGENCY PLAN HE'S NOT BEEN UNDER WAS NOT UNDERTAKEN BEFORE THE REFEREE
THAT WAS THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CRISPIN BLUNT QUESTIONING OLIVER LETWIN THE MINISTER HE'S BEEN PUT IN CHARGE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW BRECK'S IT UNIT MY LETWIN SAID THERE WOULD BE A NEW PRIME MINISTER IN SEPTEMBER SO IF YOU'RE ASKING THE PRACTICAL QUEST
IS IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO DISEASE PRE DESIGN THE STRATEGY FOR NEGOTIATION
THE ANSWER IS IT WOULD AS THINGS HAVE TURNED OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
AND TO THE ACCUSATION THAT HE'D BEEN LEFT HOLDING THE BABY MY LETWIN SAID THE BABY WAS BEING FIRMLY HELD AND HIS INTENTION WAS THAT THE BABY THE U.K. TO YOU AND ME SHOULD PROSPER SEAN CURRAN REPORT IN THERE YOU CAN HEAR MORE YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT ONE LINE EIGHT LONG WAVE RADIO JUST UP THERE HALF A STATE IT IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN
# HILLARY CLINTON WILL NOT FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR USING HER PRIVATE EMAIL FOR OFFICIAL COMMUNICATION WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF THE F.B.I. ITS DIRECTOR SAID SHE WAS EXTREMELY CARELESS BUT SHE HADN'T INTENDED TO BREAK THE LAW A CONCLUSION THAT DONALD TRUMP ARRIVAL FOR PRESIDENT SAYS SHOWS THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED HE SAYS ARE YOU SURPRISED PRIVATE YOU MUST PUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IN DANGER
LAST ASK PRESIDENT OBAMA APPEARED FOR THE FIRST TIME ALONGSIDE TO JOIN THIS CAMPAIGN AT A RALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA HE SAID HE WANTED TO SEE HER BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN HILLARY CLINTON
A RATHER DIFFERENT RESPONSE AS I SAID FROM THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP HE SAID IT WAS DISGRACEFUL SHE HADN'T BEEN CHARGED OVER THE EMAIL SCANDAL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I ALWAYS FELT THAT HILLARY CLINTON WHAT ESCAPED CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR A DANGEROUS AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOUR
BECAUSE I ALWAYS KNOW AND I ALWAYS SEE AND IT
THAT OUR SYSTEM IS IN FACT RICK IT'S TOTALLY RICK OH KAY IT'S CORRUPT IT'S RIG IT'S DISGRACEFUL
I'LL TELL HER GRIFFIN WAS AN ADVISER TO THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN WHEN HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE MADE OF THE F.B.I.'S FINDINGS
WELL I THINK THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SORT OF PERPLEXED BY THIS BECAUSE I THINK WHAT THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR MY SAID THAT HILLARY CLINTON HEAD DONE HERE MANY PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE DOES INDEED FIT THE STANDARD THE STANDARD FOUR CHARGES ON EMMELINE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
IS IS IS INTENTIONAL OR GROSSLY NEGLIGENT AND A WHILE BUT HE SAID EXTREMELY CARELESS WHICH IS PRETTY CLOSE TO GROSSLY NOW AUDIENCE I THINK THIS WAS A VERY CLOSE CALL HERE AND I THINK THE RESULT OF
HE'S GOING TO BE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HOW HE PLUNGED FOLLICLE PERMANENCE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN REPUBLICANS WERE SUPPORTED TRUMP ARE GOING TO JUMP ON US AS AN EXAMPLE THE GRIT THE PROCESSORS REARED AND HE'S GETTING AWAY WITH SOMETHING ELSE HERE AND I THINK IT'S GONNA REALLY HARDEN AS SUPPORTERS BUT YOU CLEARLY BELIEVE SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHARGED DO YOU THINK IT'S A RIGGED SYSTEM
WELL WHAT WHAT I THINK PERSONALLY I THINK WHAT'S MOST INTERESTING HERE IN THE REASON THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE NARRATIVE IN THE POLITICAL DEBATE HERE IN THE U.S. IS THAT A LOT OF WHAT IS DRIVING DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORT IS THE FEELING AMONG VOTERS ESPECIALLY REPUBLICAN WORKING CLASS WHITE BIRDERS THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN RIGGED AGAINST TODAY
RIVALRY SO TOO IT'S NOT A BIG STRETCH FOR THEM TO IMAGINE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS GETTING AWAY WITH SOMETHING HERE IN THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN RIGGED IN HERBERT AND I THINK IT IS GOING TO STRENGTHEN TRUMPS MOVEMENT
AND AT THE VERY LEAST STRENGTHEN HIS BASE SUPPORTERS I'M HILARY DIDN'T GET EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED TODAY WHICH WAS YOU KNOW A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH HOW SHOOT HIM ON THE SEAM OUT SITUATION WHICH YOU GOT INSTEAD WAS A STRONG AND MANAGEMENT FROM THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR BUT DID NOT GET A CHARGE
AND TWO PEOPLE SEE THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS THING THAT SHE'S DONE I MEAN I'M CLEARLY THE GIVEN A ROLE IT WAS SERIOUS BUT DOES IT PLAY WIDELY AMONGST THE PUBLIC OR SOMETHING THAT WAS IMMORAL I THINK THAT THE FEELING THAT PEOPLE HAD FOR A LONG TIME HILLARY CLINTON
HAS NOT BEEN ON THE UP AND UP FOR MANY MANY YEARS THROUGH THE COOKED THROUGH PER SINCE AIR EVER SINCE I WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND EVEN BEFORE THE COINS HAVE SORT OF BEEN FOLLOWED BY THIS SERIES OF SCANDALS GOING ALONG AND HERE WE ARE WITH THE NEXT ONE IS IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME THEY'VE SORT OF GOT AWAY WITH THAT IN THAT'S REALLY DRIVEN CONSERVATOR BASE VOTERS TO HAVE IN THE EXTREME
DISDAIN FOR EVERY THING HAVING TO DO WITH IT WITH THE QUIETENS AND HILARY QUITE AND PROTECTS AND SO I THINK YES YOU CAN SEE THIS BE CONTINUE TO BE A NURSE YOU FOR OUR EQUIPMENT ON COURT AND CONTINUE TO AFFECT HER IN THE POLLS ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL STRENGTHEN OUR POSITION AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE DO TAKE THE SITUATION SERIOUSLY IN NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE SPECIFIC SITUATION BUT BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT TELEGRAPH IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# IT IS NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN YOU KNOW HOW WE WERE TOLD SIX MONTHS AGO THE BUTTER IS AFTER ALL GOOD FOR US GREAT WELL NOW YES WHAT YEP FOR THEY HAVE GONE BACK TO THE OLD ADVICE IT'S NOT WHAT I SAY THAT TOM SANDERS IS THE MAN WHO KNOWS ABOUT IT HE'S EMERITUS PROFESSOR
OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING OH DEAR I DON'T KNOW I DON'T WANT TO ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS THE ANSWERS YOU YOU DECIDED YOU HAD A GROUP OF OTHERS PRESUMABLY DECIDED THAT
BUT HE'S STILL THERE BEFORE US WELL YES I MEAN I THINK I THINK IT'S AT THE OVERALL DIET THAT REALLY MATTERS NESTS NEW STUDY IS MOST POWERFUL EVIDENCE WE HAVE THEY STARTED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAINLY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND FOLLOWED THEM UP FOR THIRTY YEARS AND THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE CHANGES IN THEIR DIET
EVERY TWO TO FOUR YEARS SO IT'S A REAL GOOD STUDY THEY'VE ADJUSTED POOR FACTORS SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE FAMILY HISTORY OF DISEASE ACCEPT HER IN THIS AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT REPLACING SATURATED FAT WITH UNSATURATED FATS THAT'S TYPE ABOUT TO GET IN VEGETABLE OIL AND THINGS LIKE NUTS AND FISH IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER RISK OF DYING
A NEW FACTOR THEY FOUND IS THAT ACTUALLY IT LOOKS LIKE EATING FISH MAY PROTECT YOU FROM A GENERATION THINGS LIKE PARKINSON'S ALZHEIMER'S SO THE NEWS REALLY DOES
SUPPORT THE GUIDELINES WHICH GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO CUT BACK AND SATURATED PATENT REPLACEMENTS ACTUALLY RIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY IN
THE SATURATED FAT RANGE BUT IT IS THE PRIME OFFENDER PRESUMABLY YES I WHEN I DON'T THINK A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER DOES YOU ANY HARM ON YOUR TASTE BUT I THINK THE EATING LASHINGS OF CREAM IS NOT A GOOD IDEA RIGHT MESS OF THE SATURATED FAT IS COMING FROM FATTY MEAT PRODUCTS SAUSAGES BURGERS IT PARTICULARLY IN THE AMERICAN DIET AND ALSO IN PITS LIKE CAKES AND PASTRIES AND WHAT THIS STUDY ALSO SHOWS HAS ACTUALLY
CUTTING FAT OUT AND EATING A LOT MORE REFINED CARBOHYDRATE SUGAR AND REFINED STARCHES IS ASSOCIATED AN INCREASED RISK OF OF OF OF DIE BECAUSE WHAT WE'D BEEN TOLD TO GETHIN YOU'LL BE FAR MORE FAMILIAR WITH ALL THESE WARNINGS AND B. BUT WHAT WE'D BEEN TOLD AGAIN IS THAT SUGAR IS THE REALLY BIG EVIL
I THINK FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE HAVE SUGAR DRINKING CONTRIBUTES TO OBESITY BUT FOR THIS SORT OF AGE GROUP AND REMEMBER THEIR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THEN REALLY WEREN'T HUGE SUGAR CONSUMERS LIKE THAT WHAT THIS IS FOCUSING ON IS THE ISSUE ABOUT TYPES ABOUT AND IT
IT WAS THE FIRST STUDY REALLY TO IDENTIFY THAT PROCESS THAT'S CONTAINING TRANS FATTY IT THEY COME FROM A TYPE OF OIL CORPS PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL WERE STRONGLY LINKED TO INCREASE RISK OF HEART DISEASE BUT ALSO THIS ALSO SHARES ITS RELATED TO CANCER WE'VE GOT RID OF THEM IN THE U.K.
BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME COUNTRIES IN EUROPE THAT USE PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED OIL IT'S IMPORTANT WE PROBABLY HAVE LEGISLATION TO STOP THERE THEIR USE ALL RIGHT YOU'VE GOT LESS THAN A MINUTE I FEAR TO TELL US WHAT'S THE PERFECT DIET WELL WHAT AGE YOU ARE I KNOW YOU HAVE I THINK THE ADVICE HE'S PART OF A MEDITERRANEAN TYPE AT EYE LITTLE WRECK ME PLENTY OF FRUIT AND VEG AND YOU CAN USE VEGETABLE OIL
AND YOU CAN USE VEGETABLES RIGHT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE NOW SAY THAT THINGS LIKE SUNFLOWER OIL ACTUALLY A PRETTY RUBBISHY WHAT THIS STUDY SHOWS IT SHOWS ACTUALLY PEOPLE WHO WAIT THAT TYPE OF POLY UNSATURATED IN SUNFLOWER OIL WITH ACTUALLY THERE SAFELY WITH A LOWER RISK OF HEART DISEASE LOW RISK LOW RISK OF
OF DYING SO EVEN IF YOU USE IT FOR COOKING BECAUSE AGAIN ONE OF THOSE ONE OF THE LATEST BIT OF VICES FRIED CHIPS IN SOME FLOUR OH WELL I I THINK CHIPS THE BEST TREAT HAND OCCASIONALLY YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OIL IN YOUR MAN AT ALL DEEPLY DEPRESSING ON THE OTHER HAND THAT'S A VERY NICE AND SO'S OLIVE OIL HERE WE ARE JOHN SANDERS THANKS A LOT

THAT SOUND YOU REFER TO YOU THAT'S WHY I PROBABLY HIM CALLED DOODLE DOODLE BUGS A BOM BOM BOM CHUCK CHUCK CHUCK SILENCE AND SILENCE WAS THAT MOMENT YOU KNEW YOU HAD TO TAKE COVER THE PROGRAMME THAT GIVES A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE TO CURRENT EVENTS
SO THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER TECHNOLOGICAL CIVILIAN AND MILITARY REVOLUTION THE LONGVIEW PRESENTED BY JONATHAN FRIEDLAND RETURNS NEXT MONDAY MORNING AT NINE AND THEN AVAILABLE ON THE B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WEBSITE
# COMING UP IN THE PROGRAMME WE'LL BE TALKING TO THE WELSH COMEDIAN ELLIS JAMES AS HE MAKES HIS WAY TO FRANCE TO WATCH WALES PLAY PORTUGAL IN THE EUROS TONIGHT EIGHT O'CLOCK YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND JOHN HUMPHRYS
# IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE SIXTH OF JULY THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING WITH A REPORT ON THE IRAQ WAR BY SIR JOHN CHILCOT WILL FINALLY BE PUBLISHED THIS MORNING THE MILITARY AND POLITICIANS SUCH AS TONY BLAIR AND EXPECTED TO FACE CRITICISM
# THE CONTEST TO BE THE NEW CONSERVATIVE LEADER AND PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THREE CANDIDATES WITH THERESA MAY SCORING THE MOST SUPPORT SO FAR AND WALES ARE PREPARING FOR THEIR SEMI FINAL CLASH AGAINST PORTUGAL AT EURO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY NEIL SLEEP MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS AFTER IT WAS SET UP THE CHILCOT INQUIRY INTO THE IRAQ WAR WILL PUBLISH ITS FINDINGS THIS MORNING
# IT'S MORE THAN THIRTEEN YEARS SINCE TONY BLAIR COMMITTED BRITISH FORCES TO THE U.S. LED INVASION SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS TOPPLED QUICKLY BUT IRAQ HAS BEEN RIVEN BY SECTARIAN CONFLICT EVER SINCE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF IRAQIS DIED ALONG WITH ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE U. K. SERVICE PERSONNEL CLAIMS THAT THE IRAQI LEADER HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION PROVED UNFOUNDED
TONY BLAIR HAS SAID HE DOES NOT REGRET REMOVING A BRUTAL DICTATOR THE INQUIRY WAS ASKED TO IDENTIFY WHAT LESSONS SHOULD BE LEARNED ITS CHAIRMAN SIR JOHN CHILCOT HAS SAID HE HOPES FUTURE MILITARY ACTION WON'T BE LAUNCHED WITHOUT MORE RIGOUROUS ANALYSIS IS OUR CORRESPONDENT PETER HUNT
THE TASK WAS DAUNTING TO INVESTIGATE THE BUILD UP TO WAR THE MILITARY ACTION AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE U.K.'S RESPONSE IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THE REPORT FILLS TWELVE VOLUMES CONTAINS TWO POINT SIX MILLION WORDS AND IS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE LENGTH OF WAR AND PEACE
THOSE CRITICAL OF TONY BLAIR'S LEGACY DEFINING DECISION TO GO TO WAR WILL FOCUS INITIALLY ON THE CONTENTS OF TWENTY NINE MEMOS THE LABOUR PRIME MINISTER SENT THE U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH
DO THEY CONTAIN PRIVATE PROMISES OF SUPPORT WHICH WEREN'T MADE PUBLIC AT THE TIME WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED FOR WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THE WARS LEGALITY AND THE PLANNING FOR THE AFTERMATH
JOHN CHILCOT HAS OUTLINED WHAT HE HOPED THE REPORT'S PUBLICATION WOULD ACHIEVE THE MAIN EXPECTATION THAT I HAVE IS THAT IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE IN FUTURE TO ENGAGE IN A MILITARY OR INDEED A DIPLOMATIC ENDEAVOUR ON SUCH A SCALE AND OF SUCH GRAVITY WITHOUT REALLY CAREFUL
CHALLENGE ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTIVE POLITICAL JUDGEMENT BEING APPLIED TO IT
JOHN ALSO SAID HIS COMMITTEE HAVEN'T SHIED AWAY FROM CRITICISING INDIVIDUALS WHERE THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTED SUCH FINDINGS
THE INQUIRY WASN'T ASKED TO ESTABLISH GUILT OR INNOCENCE BUT THE REPUTATIONS OF A NUMBER OF SENIOR FIGURES IN THE THEN LABOUR GOVERNMENT ASIDE FROM TONY BLAIR WILL BE CLOSELY SCRUTINISED IN THE REPORT AS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IN WATSON EXPLAINS THE IRAQ WAR AND WHAT FOLLOWED HAS CAST A LONG SHADOW OVER BRITISH POLITICS AND FOREIGN POLICY
TONY BLAIR WOULDN'T APOLOGISE FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN UNST SITTING SADDAM HUSSEIN BUT SHE HAS ALREADY EXPRESSED REGRET ABOUT INACCURATE INTELLIGENCE AND HAS RECOGNISED THAT HE UNDERESTIMATED THE EXTENT OF FACTIONAL FIGHTING THAT WOULD BE UNLEASHED
IT'S FAR MORE LIKELY THAT THE CURRENT TO LABOUR LEADER WILL APOLOGISE FOR HIS PARTY'S ROLE IN THE CONFLICT ONCE THE IS PUBLISHED JEREMY CORBIN WAS A LEADING FIGURE IN THE STOP THE WAR DEMONSTRATIONS IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE DURING THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP CONTEST LAST YEAR HE REPEATED HIS LONG HELD BELIEF THAT THE CONFLICT WASN'T JUST CATASTROPHIC BUT ILLEGAL
BUT ANY POLITICAL CRITICISM CHILCOT IS UNLIKE THE TO BE LIMITED TO TONY BLAIR AND ENQUIRY IS SCRUTINISED THE PROVISION OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT ANTIQUITY OF POST WAR PLANNING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL ADVICE ALL OF WHICH COULD MEAN THAT THERE'LL BE QUESTIONS FOR THE THEN FOREIGN SECRETARY JACK STRAW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL LORD GOLDSMITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE GEOFF HOON AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY CLARE SHORT TO ANSWER
IRAQI OFFICIALS SAY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE NOW KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A SUICIDE BOMBING IN BAGHDAD ON SUNDAY HAS RISEN TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THE ATTACK CLAIMED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IS THE DEADLIEST IN THE IRAQI CAPITAL SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND THREE INVASION

# GENERAL REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHEN GORDON BROWN ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WOULD BE A PROPER INQUIRY INTO THE IRAQ WAR LED BY SIR JOHN CHILCOT HE SAID IT MIGHT TAKE A YEAR
THAT WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO THIS MORNING IT'LL BE PUBLISHED AMONG THE MANY WHO WILL BE STUDYING ITS FINDINGS CAREFULLY WILL BE THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE CHANGED FOREVER AS A RESULT OF THE WAR THE FAMILIES OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE BRITISH MILITARY PERSONNEL WHO DIED IN IT ONE OF THOSE IS KAREN THORNTON SHE IS ON THE LINE OH GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING AND YOUR SON LEE WAS TWENTY TWO WHEN HE DIED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AS A RESULT OF BEING SHOT A SINGLE GUNSHOT WOUND WHILE HE WAS ON PATROL IN BASRA THAT'S RIGHT ISN'T IT YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
AND WHEN YOU HEARD THAT TERRIBLE NEWS OBVIOUSLY GRIEF CAME FIRST AND
EQUALLY OBVIOUSLY GRIEF IS STILL WITH YOU BUT WHAT OTHER QUESTIONS A LOT OF THE BIG QUESTIONS THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE ANSWERED IN THAT REPORT
TODAY I WAS JUST HOPING TO GET THE TRUTH AND JUST FIND OUT ABOUT ALL THE LIES THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN TOWELS AND IT WAS PLANNED A YEAR BEFORE WE ACTUALLY WENT INTO IRAQ AND JUST ABOUT THEIR LACK OF EQUIPMENT WE JUST WANT THE TRUTH AT THE END OF THE DAY
AND AS FAR AS THE LIES ARE CONCERNED WHAT WHAT WORRIES YOU IS THAT MISTER BLAIR HAD ALREADY AGREED WITH PRESIDENT BUSH THAT HE WOULD GO TO WAR AND THAT EVERYTHING HE DID AFTER THAT WAS DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE THAT YEAH
WHY ARE YOU LET ME USE THE WORD SUSPICIOUS OF WHAT HE HAS SAID TO US BECAUSE OF COURSE HE'S ASSURED US MANY TIMES OF THAT WAS NOT THE CASE
I JUST THINK IT WAS ALL BASED ON LIES I THINK EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THAT MAN'S MOUTH HAS BEEN A THE KITE IN A MAC WHY
I JUST THINK HE'D AGREED WITH GEORGE BUSH THE EDGE FOR THAT WAS GOING TO GO IN THERE AND ANY KIND OF INTELLIGENCE HE GOT IN THAT YEAR HE JUST TOTALLY EXAGGERATED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WENT TO WAR WITH HER
AND YOU SAY YOU WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE WERE TOLD YOU WERE IN PARTICULAR AND THE SOLDIERS THEMSELVES WERE TOLD ABOUT EQUIPMENT
YEAH I THINK THE EQUIPMENT THEY WERE SENT WITH THE EITHER DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH EQUIPMENT EITHER QUIT THE EQUIPMENT THE DISH HAVE WASN'T FIT FOR PURPOSE AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW TONY BLAIR SENT INTO WAR WITH THAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT THAT JUST COST SO MANY LIVES AND THE LACK OF IT
WHAT HAVE YOU AND OTHER MOTHERS AND RELATIVES HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE YOU HAD THAT TERRIBLE NEWS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX
JUST GRIEVING FASTENS INDOORS HE'S REALLY JUST TRYING TO GET THE TRUTH AT THE END OF THE DAY AND HAS BUSY CHATTING ABOUT THAT ONE AND WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TRYING TO GET THE TRUTH WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
WE'VE BEEN GOING TO MEETINGS BEEN CAMPAIGNING TO GET THIS INQUIRY
AND WAS IT IN THE END THE WAY THE INQUIRY WAS CONDUCTED PUTTING ASIDE THE LENGTH OF TIME IT HAS ALL TAKEN BUT WAS IT WHAT YOU WANTED TO HAPPEN DID IT WAS THE SORT OF ENQUIRY YOU HAD HOPED WOULD TAKE PLACE
I DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT UNTIL TODAY WE READ WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE REPORT BUT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD THE NEWS IT'S NOBODY'S GOING TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT AND I THINK THAT'S SO WRONG YOU THINK THAT'S WRONG WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN THEM I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO LIED
SHOULD BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE AND BY HELD TO ACCOUNT YOU MEAN WHAT
TRY TO WALK WALK AROUND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH SO MANY PEOPLE
SO YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE TONY BLAIR OF FACING TRIAL
DEFINITELY BUT BUT SURELY THAT DEPENDS ON THE RESULT OF THIS INQUIRY ON THE FINDINGS OF THIS ENQUIRY YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING IT DEPENDS ON OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE RETAIN THE REPORTS IF IT IS PROVED THAT YOU'D LIED
THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR
THE PROBLEM IS ISN'T IT THAT THE INQUIRY IS NOT SPECIFICALLY LOOKING INTO AS IT WERE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAR IT'S TRYING TO ANSWER THAT VARIOUS QUESTIONS AS WE KNOW BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY IN TO CULPABILITY
NO IT'S POSTIE FOR LESSONS ANY FUTURE THAT'S RIGHT COMPLEX BUT ALSO I DO THINK THAT IF IT'S PROOF THAT HE LIED THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO JUST GET AWAY
SO YOU'D LIKE TO SEE HIM FACE SOME SORT OF CAUGHT
IF IT'S PROVED THAT WHAT WE HEARD IN THE MEDIA AND EVERYTHING IF IT'S PROVED THAT THE LIGHTS IT'S TRUE ABOUT ALL THE LIES THEN DEFINITELY MISSUS THORNTON THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US
# THINKING IT'S NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN A PATIENT LAY DEAD FOR HOURS IN ANY IN NORTH MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL BEFORE ANYONE NOTICED THAT'S ONE OF THE SHOCKING FINDINGS OF N.H.S. INSPECTORS THEY ALSO FOUND THAT STAFF WERE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP FOR FEAR OF RETRIBUTION AND ON ONE DAY THERE WAS ONLY ONE COMMODE FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PATIENTS THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF HOSPITALS SIR MIKE RICHARDS
WITH US IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING CAN YOU GIVE US SOME SENSE OF WHAT THE INSPECTORS FOUND AS TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN IT IS ONE OF LONDON'S BUSIEST HOSPITALS IT IS INDEED ONE OF LONDON'S BUSIEST HOSPITALS AROUND FIVE HUNDRED PATIENTS A DAY GO THROUGH THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
AND WHAT WE FOUND WERE PROBLEMS AT EVERY STEP SO IF YOU CAME BY AMBULANCE THERE WERE DELAYS IN HANDOVER TO THE EMERGENCY STAFF ROUGHLY SPEAKING TWO AMBULANCES A DAY WERE BEING DELAYED FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR BEFORE THE PATIENTS WERE BEING RECEIVED BY THE EMERGENCY STAFF IF YOU WALKED INTO THE HUT THAT ANY DEPARTMENT THE SO CALLED TRIAGE SYSTEM WHICH TELLS YOU WHICH WAY TO GO WASN'T WORKING YOU COULD BE LONG DELAYS BEFORE YOU WERE EITHER ASSESSED BY A NURSE OR A DOCTOR
ONCE YOU WERE IN THE DEPARTMENT THERE WERE FURTHER LONG DELAYS TO HAVE PEOPLE ON TROLLEYS THEY WEREN'T BEING PROPERLY CHECKED WHILE THAT WHILE THEY WERE IN THE DEPARTMENT AND SO THEY WEREN'T THEN GETTING INTO THE WARDS IN A TIMELY WAY SO ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS WHICH IS WHY THERE IS THE SUGGESTION THAT A PATIENT LAY DEAD FOR UP TO FOUR AND A HALF HOURS YES THAT WAS HER INVESTIGATION AT THE HOSPITAL HAD ACTUALLY DONE ITSELF AND BUT THAT WAS THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAD THAT THEY WERE NOT DOING THE ROUNDS PROPERLY TO MAKE SURE THE PATIENTS WERE O.K.
WE CAN SAY THIS WAS AN INCREDIBLY BUSY HOSPITAL BE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE WERE NO CONSULTANTS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AFTER ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT YES THEM THE MAIN PROBLEM FOR THIS DEPARTMENT WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE GOOD ENOUGH LEADERSHIP IN THE DEPARTMENT I THINK THE LEADERSHIP ISSUE IS REALLY THE CRITICAL ONE AND
SO THAT THE JUNIOR STAFF WERE NOT SUPPORTED AT WITH A MIDDLE GRADE DOCTORS SO AND THERE WERE TOO FEW CONSULTANTS BUT NOR WERE PEOPLE BEING ATTRACTED TO WORK IN THAT DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR POOR LEADERSHIP AND IT WAS PRESUMABLY THAT WHICH LED TO THIS CULTURE WHERE NOBODY FELT THEY COULD SAY ANYTHING ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS WAS THE INSPECTION WAS IN APRIL YES IT'S ONE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS NECESSARILY PARTICULARLY HIGH PRESSURE POINT IN THE YEAR AT THAT TIME WE HEAR ABOUT THINGS OVER CHRISTMAS AND THROUGH WINTER I THINK
A AND E. DEPARTMENTS ARE FACING STRAIN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND THAT'S TRUE ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT THIS WAS THE PICTURE THAT WE SAW IN APRIL WE WENT BACK IN IN MAY AND IMPACT WE DID GO BACK IN LAST WEEK AND I CAN SAY THAT THINGS HAVE TURNED A CORNER NOW AND SAY I THINK THE SITUATION IS DIFFERENT AND THAT IS NEW LEADERSHIP IN THAT DEPARTMENT THEY HAVE STRENGTH AND BOTH THE MEDICAL AND THE NURSE LEADERSHIP
ADDITIONAL A STAFF ARE BEING BROUGHT IN A TEAM HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SUPPORT THE STAFF THERE AND THINGS ARE ALREADY CHANGING SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE EXTRA DOCTORS THAT I KNOW PERSONALLY HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE ALREADY BUCK AND HOW DO I KNOW THAT BECAUSE STAFF WHO SAID THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT THE HOSPITAL ARE NOW SAYING THEY WON'T LEAVE THE HOSPITAL WE CONSTANTLY HEAR HOW THE N.H.S. IS PRETTY MUCH AT BREAKING POINT
IS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS A REFLECTION OF THAT AULD COULD COULD THIS BE AVOID IT DOES IT NEED TO BE LIKE THAT
WELL WHAT WE SEE IS VARIATION WE DO SEE SOME VERY GOOD A.&E. DEPARTMENTS DESPITE THE STRAIN THAT EVERYBODY'S UNDER THERE ARE TEN WE HAVE RATED AS OUTSTANDING WE'VE EVEN SEEN OTHERS WHERE THEY WERE INADEQUATE WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN TURNED ROUND SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT IMPROVEMENT AND I COME BACK TO THE NEED FOR LEADERSHIP BOTH THE LEVEL OF THE TRUST OVERALL THE SUPPORT BEING GIVEN BY THE TRUST AND AT THE LEVEL OF THE EMERGENCY DEPART SO ITS LEADERSHIP MANAGEMENT RATHER THAN RESOURCES
WELL I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE REAL STRAINS ON RESOURCES AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE DON'T WANT MORE GUNS WE DO WANT MORE DOCTORS AND NURSES THAT IS TRUE IN THE N.E. DEPARTMENT BUT GOOD LEADERSHIP CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE SO MIKE RICHARDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ON THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS BEEN MEETING THE BOSSES OF THE BIG BANKS HE WANTS UNDER KEEP BLENDING AFTER THE REFERENDUM VOTE DIE
# YES I HAVE WITH ME SIR HOWARD DAVIES CHAIRMAN OF THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND HE WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO'S AT THE MEETING THE MEETING CAME OF COURSE ON THE SAME DAY THAT MARK KIND OF THE GUN OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAID BANKS COULD EAT INTO PART OF THEIR RAINY DAY RESERVES THE IDEA THAT THIS WILL FREE UP ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION POUNDS OR NEW LIMPING SO WHAT WAS THE MOOD OF THE MEETING AND WANT TO THE CHANCELLOR I HAVE TO SAY
THE CHANCELLOR WAS ACTUALLY ASKING US QUESTIONS PRIMARILY ASKING US WHAT WE WERE SEEING FROM OUR LOAN OFFICERS AND BRANCHES ABOUT DEMAND FOR LENDING AND WE WERE ABLE TO TELL HIM THAT THE POSITION IS NOT SO BAD BUT THERE IS SOME SLOW DOWN PARTICULARLY IN THE PROPERTY MARKET AND PARTICULARLY WHERE YOU HAVE OVERSEAS INVESTORS AND PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE LONDON
SO HE WAS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND ALSO OF COURSE CONCERNED TO SAY WELL IS IT TRUE THAT THE BANKS ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS FOR SMALL FIRMS ET-CETERA TO WHICH I THINK WE CAN HONESTLY SAY YES WE ARE NOT UNDER STRAIN FROM A CAPITAL POINT OF VIEW WE HAVE MONEY AVAILABLE TO LEND
THIS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION EXTRA THE MARK CARNEY TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY WHICH WHICH WILL BEEN NEW MONEY I GUESS IN THE SENSEI WILL MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE IS IT ENOUGH TO MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE IS THE DEMAND FOR IT
WELL WHAT DID THE BANK OF ENGLAND ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY WAS THAT THEY WERE NOT IMPOSING ANOTHER SLUG OF CAPITAL ON THE BANKS WHICH THEY HAD SAID AS RECENTLY AS MARCH THEY WOULD IMPOSED BY NEXT YEAR SO BY COMPARISON WITH WHERE WE WILL BE NEXT YEAR WE WILL NOT HAVE TO HAVE AS MUCH OF A RESERVE AS WE AS WE SHOULD HAVE DONE SO THAT IS IN THEORY CREATES MORE ROOM TO LEND
BUT THE GOVERNOR DID SAID QUITE RIGHTLY THAT THE KEY IS WHAT THE DEMAND FOR LENDING HIS LAST TIME WE HAD A PROBLEM IN THAT DEMAND FOR LENDING SELL BUT ALSO SUPPLY FELL BECAUSE THE BANKS HAD TOO LITTLE CAPITAL AND SO THEY WERE TRYING TO BUILD UP THEIR RESERVES IN ORDER TO SURVIVE THAT IS NOT THE POSITION
TODAY SO I THINK IT'S PRIMARILY A DEMAND THIS YEAR AT THE MOMENT HAVE A ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND ITSELF IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE BIG LOSERS FROM THE REFERENDUM VOTE BEFORE THE VOTE THE SHARES WERE UP AROUND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY P. RIGHT DOWN TO ABOUT ONE SIXTY P. WHY HAVEN'T PISSED AS TURN THEIR BACK ON THE BANK
IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY BANK SHARES HAVE REACTED SINCE THE REFERENDUM VOTE IT'S CLEAR THAT THOSE BANKS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY EXPOSED TO THE U.K. ECONOMY SPECIFICALLY HAVE BEEN THE ONES THAT HAVE SUFFERED MOST AND THAT'S THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND AND LLOYDS PRIMARILY SO INVESTORS ARE SAYING THERE'S GOING TO BE A SLOWDOWN IN THE U.K. ECONOMY
THAT IS PARTICULARLY BAD FOR BANKS MOST OF WHOSE BUSINESSES IN THE U.K. WHICH IS NOW TRUE OF ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND OTHER BANKS LIKE H.S.B.C. WHO'VE GOT FOREIGN EARNINGS IN DOLLARS OR IN HONG KONG DOLLARS HAVE BEEN
CUSHIONED IF YOU LIKE FROM THAT EFFECT BUT IF YOU ARE A MAJOR U.K. BANK YOU CANNOT HIDE FROM WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE U.K. ECONOMY INDEED IF YOU DID YOU MAKE IT WORSE BECAUSE IF WE THEN PULLED IN LENDING IN THE U.K. TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM LOSSES YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD MAKE THEM IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT AS WE ARE ALL POORER THAT'S A RESULT OF THIS AREN'T WE BECAUSE WERE ALL INVESTORS AND THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND AND YOUR COMPANY TED THE TAXMAN OWNS WHAT ARE SEVENTY SOMETHING YES THE TAXPAYER OWN SEVENTY THREE PERCENT OF US
AND YES HAS LOST QUITE A LOT OF MONEY ON THAT SHAREHOLDERS MAY COME BACK OF COURSE WE WOULD HOPE IT WELL BUT HAS FOR THE MOMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS PLANNING AT SOME STAGE TO RE PRIVATISE NOT QUITE THE RIGHT WAY BUT TO CELSIUS IN THE MARKET YES IT'S SELDOM AT STAKE GIVING THAT'S GONE FURTHER BACK AS A RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM BUT REALISTICALLY IT PROBABLY HAS I MEAN THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER VIEW AT THIS WHEN WE GET A NEW GOVERNMENT AND THEY WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT PHASING THEY WERE PLANNING TO SELL DOWN MOST OF THEIR STATE BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT
ELECTION WHICH IS WHAT GEORGE OSBORNE SAID BUT OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT IGNORE THE PRICE AND YOU KNOW IT WOULD NOT BE A GREAT TIME TO SELL A LARGE PIECE OF A BANK AT THE MOMENT INTO A FALLING MARKET SO I THINK ONE CAN DEDUCE THAT THAT IS LIKELY TO BE LATER RATHER THAN SOONER NOW THAT THE REFERENDUM VOTE WASN'T THE ONLY THING THE ONLY CLOUD ON THE HORIZON THROWBACK A SCONE YOU SAW HER BIG LITIGATION OUTSTANDING IN AMERICA
SOME PEOPLE SPECULATED THE FIND COULD BE UP TO NINE BUT THEY'VE GOT AND OF COURSE THE DOLLAGHAN STRENGTHENED NOW WERE YOU CLEVER EM DID YOU HEDGE AGAINST THAT FINE FROM AMERICA YES HE DID SO YOU SEE PROTECTED YOURSELF AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DOLLAR AHEAD OF THE BOAT
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE FINE WILL BE BUT WE HAVE TAKEN OUT SOME PROTECTION I'M GONNA TELL YOU PRECISELY HOW MUCH BUT WE DIDN'T NOTICE THIS YES THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR HOWARD DAVIES CHAIRMAN OF THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND
# AND DOMINIC THANKS VERY MUCH TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE LAST TIME WALES EVEN PLAYED IN A MAJOR FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT WAS BACK IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT TONIGHT THEY COMPETE FOR A PLACE IN THE FINAL OF THE EUROS IF THEY BEAT PORTUGAL AND GET THROUGH IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME A BRITISH SIDE HAS REACHED AN INTERNATIONAL FINAL SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY SIX QUITE A MOMENT

I'LL BE FOLLOWING WALES SINCE I WAS ABOUT TEN AND I THOUGHT OF THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THAT TIME
I'VE WATCHED ABSOLUTE DOGGEREL MOTHER IT'S A COMPETITION BUT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE TO SUPPORT A SUCCESSFUL SIDE AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET SOME SIMILAR PLAYERS HAVE A MONTH FOR THE TOURNAMENT STARTED AND
THIS SUCH THIS SO APPROACHABLE LOWLANDS THIS SUCH A GOOD BUNCH THE COUNTRY SORT OF CAN REALLY BE PROUD OF THEM IT'S LIKE I CAN'T PUT INTO WORDS OH K. NOW YOU SAID BEFORE THE GAME WITH BELGIUM THAT IF THEY BEAT BELGIUM YOU'D EAT CHIPS AND MAYO AND DRINK ELEVEN PERCENT LAGER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'VE STUCK TO THAT PROMISE BUT WHAT
B. PORTUGAL I HAVE TO BE HONEST THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN I THINK I THINK I NEED TO STOP MAKING SUCH OUTLANDISH COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY KEEP WINNING AND I KEEP HAVING TO ME AND SORT OF LIVE BY THESE ABSURD RULES UPSET MYSELF
IF I DID EAT CHIPS TO MAKE YOU DRINK ADRIC PER CENT MARGARET'S ESTIMATE THAT IT WILL BE VERY SHORT LIKES SOMEONE I'VE GOT WORK WHATEVER WHATEVER HAPPENS THERE'LL BE A NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M A I'M A LIGHT FOR THE FINAL ON SUNDAY IF WE GET THERE WELL WE'RE EXCEPT THIS HIGHER SPIRITUAL PLANE THAT YOU'RE ON AS A RESULT OF THIS THE SEMI FINAL GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT YOU'LL BE LIKE IF THEY GET INTO THE FINAL
WHEN I THINK I'VE CREATED MY OWN RELIGION BY THEN FOR RELIGION IN ENTIRELY BASED ON THE DOCTRINES OF CHRIS COLEMAN I THINK REMARKABLY YOU'VE GOT JOHN HUMPHRYS SIDE UP TO THE RELIGION DOES HE DOES GIANT PRETEND TO BE IMPARTIAL NO NOT YOU GET HELEN WHO'S LUCKY EH COURSE I THINK JOHN SAID TO ME THIS MORNING AT FOUR M.

SPORTS EDITOR DAN ROWAN IS IN LYON AHEAD OF MUCH MORNING DAN
IT'S NOT SUCH A HUGE DAY IN THE HISTORY OF WELSH FOOTBALL HOW DID THE TEAM GET HERE
IT DOES TAKE SOME EXPLAINING THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WHAT WHALES HAVE ACHIEVED HERE IN FRANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN I THINK SCARCELY BELIEVABLE A FEW WEEKS AGO FIRST TOPPING THEIR GROUP WINNING FOUR OUT OF THEIR FIVE MATCHES SO FAR IN THEIR FIRST SEMI FINAL AS YOU SAID IN THERE ONE HUNDRED FORTY YEAR TEAM HISTORY BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THIS HASN'T HAPPENED BY ACCIDENT IT'S NO LUCKY FLUKE THIS FIRST AND FOREMOST HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF A FANTASTIC TEAM SPIRIT SIMILAR I THINK TO SURPRISE PREMIER LEAGUE WINNERS LEICESTER CITY THE PLACE SEEMED TO BE
PLAYING FOR EACH OTHER THEY'RE MORE THAN THE SUM OF THEIR PARTS THE WELSH MOTTO AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD IS TO GET A STRONGER BUT THIS IS NO SIMPLE MARKETING GIMMICK WALES REALLY DO LIVE BY THOSE WORKS THEY SEEM TO BE FRIENDS THERE'S A TOGETHERNESS AND A BOND BETWEEN
HAS PROVED CRUCIAL BOTH IN QUALIFYING AND THEY'RE HERE IN FRANCE YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE WAY THEY CELEBRATE AFTER MATCHES IN THE WAY THAT THEY THEY TRAIN UP IN NORTHERN FRANCE WHERE THEY'RE BASE THAT'S BEEN FORCED I THINK ON WHAT'S BEEN A REMARKABLE JOURNEY IS TAKING THEM FOR A LOWLY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEENTH IN THE WORLD RANKINGS AS RECENTLY AS TWENTY LEATHER
ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE TOP TEN NOW AND THAT REVIVAL I THINK WAS STARTED BY FORMER MANAGER GARY SPEED AND THEN AFTER HIS TRAGIC DEATH IN TWENTY ELEVEN BY HIS FRIEND AND FORMER TEAM MATE CHRIS COLEMAN WHO DESERVES HUGE CREDIT FOR THIS SUCCESS AND USED TACTICS AND SELECTIONS HAVE PAID OFF TO SUCH DRAMATIC EFFECT HE MAY ONLY BE PAID A SMALL PROPORTION OF WHAT HOT SHOULD AS ENGLAND MANAGER OR COLEMAN'S COME OF AGE AS A COACH HERE WILES OF A WELL ORGANISED THEY CAN ONE DIFFERENT WAYS THEY HANDLED THEIR ONE DEFEAT TO ENGLAND
THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY AND BOUNCED BACK IMMEDIATELY AND THEN AS THE PLAYERS OF COURSE IN WALES ARE BUILT AROUND THE WORLD CLASS STAR GARETH BALE FOR HIM PLAYING FOR IS
HE MEANS SO MUCH YOU GET THE BEST OUT OF HIM PLAYS LIKE OUR RAMSEY JOE ALLEN DEFENDER ASHLEY WILLIAMS HAVE ALL BEEN CRITICAL TO KNOW WALES IS A SMALL COUNTRY COMPARED TO THE OTHER FOOTBALLING SUPERPOWERS
THE SMALLEST OF POPULATION TERMS EVER TO SEMI FINAL SAW A LOT'S BEEN INVESTED IN SCOUTING TALENT BORN ELSEWHERE NINE OF THIS CURRENT SQUAT IN FACT WERE BORN ACROSS THE BORDER IN ENGLAND ARE PLAYING
THIS TEAM SEEMS TO MEAN SO MUCH THOUGH FOR THOSE PLAYERS PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE BEEN SELECTED ELSEWHERE SO THEY WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY AND AFTER WAITING FIFTY YEARS FOR A MAJOR TAUNT MISCHANCE SIMPLY HAS TO BE TAKEN WE'VE SEEN WITHOUT IT SEEMS PLACE BE BORED ALMOST BY
MAJOR TOURNAMENTS NOT THIS WELSH TEAM WHO SEEM TO BE RELISHING IT THE WELSH F.A. ALSO HAVE A TURNOVER THAT'S A FRACTION OF THE ENGLISH F.A. BUT THEY'RE PUT IN PLACE A HIGH PROFESSIONAL SYSTEM WITH HUGE INVESTMENT FACILITIES COACHING SCOUTING EVEN THE CHOICE OF HOTEL THE AEROPLANE THE WELSH
BAILS PHYSIO AT REAL MADRID FOR EXAMPLE'S BEEN BROUGHT OVER IN SEARCH OF THOSE MARGINAL GAINS THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND THEN ON TOP OF ALL THOSE THINGS AS THE FANS INCREDIBLE SUPPORT HERE IN FRANCE ESPECIALLY HERE TONIGHT NO DOUBT IN LYON AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS APPEAR TO HAVE COME TOGETHER AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME IN THE WALES AS YOU SAY ON THE VERGE OF HISTORY

# WITH US HERE NOW WITH ALL THE DETAILS GOOD MORNING MICHAEL MORNING SIR GOOD MORNING JOHN IT'S THREE TIMES LONGER THAN THE BIBLE AND HAS TAKEN MORE TIME TO PRODUCE THAN THE WAR IT SET OUT TO EXAMINE BUT TODAY THE CHILCOTT REPORT INTO THE INVASION OF IRAQ AND ITS AFTERMATH WILL FINALLY BE PUBLISHED WE DON'T NEED TO TELL US THE WAR WAS A DISASTER THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MOSTLY CIVILIANS DEAD MILLIONS DISPLACED THE SECTARIAN CIVIL WAR AND MEDIEVAL E. BRUTAL RELIGIOUSLY INSPIRED LUNACY SPREADING ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST
BUT IN ALL THAT EVIDENCE AND ANALYSIS WILL BE LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER TO THE SIMPLE BUT DIFFICULT QUESTION WAS THE DECISION TO GO TO WAR MORALLY JUSTIFIED IF IT WAS TAKEN IN GOOD FAITH BUT ON INFORMATION SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND TO BE INCORRECT IS IT FAIR TO BE CONDEMNED WITH HINDSIGHT AND WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MORALITY AND CONSEQUENCE IS RIGHT AND WRONG GOOD AND EVIL TO BE DETERMINED BY OUTCOME WOULD WE WORRY FOR A SECOND IF IRAQ WAS NOW A FLOURISHING AND PEACEFUL DEMOCRACY THE MORAL MAZE AFTER THE NEWS AT EIGHT TONIGHT

YOU GUYS YES YES I COULD TRY AND RUN UP THAT ARGUMENT MICHAEL GO OVERCOME COME FIRST BUT I THINK IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE TRICKY IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THERESA MAY IS GOING THROUGH TO THE BALLET RIGHT EXACTLY PAY MORE THAN THE SAME YES I AGREE WITH THAT AND I THINK
WE HAVE A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT FORWARD THEIR TWO BEST CANDIDATES IT'S PARTY LEADER BUT IT IS ALSO PRIME MINISTER AND I THINK THAT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE PARTY AND THE PUBLIC WILL NOT FORGIVE US IF WE DO NOT DO THAT RIGHT AND IT HAS TO BE IN YOUR OPINION PENNY MORE THAN IT HAS TO BE YOUR WOMAN BECAUSE SHE WAS A WOMAN IT SEEMS HAVE GOT TO BE TWO WOMEN ON THE LIST IS THAT RIGHT I DON'T THINK SO I THINK A THA A FINAL WITH TWO WOMEN AND IT WOULD BE VERY EXCITING BUT I THINK IT'S GOT TO BE ON MERIT
ANDREA I THINK HE'S THE STRONGEST CANDIDATE ON THE ECONOMY SHE IS THE PERSON WHO HAD THE FORESIGHT TO SET UP THE FRESH START PROJECT FIVE YEARS AGO TO LOOK AT WHAT WE COULD LEVER FROM THE E.U. AND WHAT LEAVING WOULD MEAN SHE HAD THE FORESIGHT TO DO THAT AND SHE'S A TREMENDOUS SOCIAL REFORMER AND I THINK THAT THE MEMBERSHIP CERTAINLY
WOULD LIKE A RUN OFF BETWEEN THE TWO LADIES I BOOZING I THINK MICHAEL GAVE IS THE MOST EXPERIENCED OF THE TWO CANDIDATES HAVE IN EFFECT VYING FOR THE SECOND SPOT ON THE BALLET HE'S BEEN A SENIOR CABINET MINISTER OBVIOUSLY AS EDUCATION SECRETARY PUSHING THROUGH IMPORTANT REFORMS AND NOW IT'S JUST A SECRETARY DOING THE SAME KIND OF THING IN TERMS I THINK WHAT MOTIVATES MICHAEL AND YOU'VE SEEN IT FROM HIS SPEECHES AND ALSO FROM
HIS CAREER IN THESE PACE IS ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE IT'S ABOUT REACHING OUT TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND ENSURING THAT NO ONE IS EXCLUDED FROM A SOCIETY I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT WHAT WE WE NEVER REALLY MENTION ABOUT MICHAEL IS
HE IS VERY CLOSE TO THE CHANCELLOR PRIME MINISTER HE WAS VERY MUCH AT THE CENTRE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S APPS ON A WHOLE RANGE OF OTHER THINGS SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT WILL A WAS VERY CLOSE BUT THE CHARTS OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND B. MAYBE NOT SUCH A GOOD THING TO HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY CLOSE TO THE CHANCER REALLY GIVEN THE WAY THINGS HAVE ARE AND DIE OR C. WHEREVER WE ARE HE'S
PROVEN TO BE A RUTHLESS ASSASSIN I DON'T AGREE WITH AT ALL I MEAN HE OILING YOUR CAMPAIGN I DON'T AGREE WITH ANY OF IT I MEAN HE CAMPAIGNED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE BASIS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT ANYONE
IN THE CABINET WHO FELT WE SHOULD LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD DO SIR MICHAEL CAMPAIGN FOR THAT AND I THINK HE WAS BRAVE ACTUALLY TOO NOT TO BITE HIS TONGUE AND SORT OF GO ALONG WITH THE BORIS BANDWAGON BUT TO ACTUALLY CALL IT OUT AND FOLLOW IT THROUGH TO ITS LOW EXCEPT THAT IT RAISING ABOUT AS JUDGE HOUSING THAT OBVIOUSLY IT'S OBVIOUSLY CAUSED MICHAEL'S AND DIFFICULT BUT WHAT I THINK YOU SAW FROM THE BALLET YESTERDAY IS THAT FROM THAT POSITION THE MORE M. PEAS AND COLLEAGUES HAVE SEEN HIM AGAIN THERE MICHAEL THEY KNOW THE MICHAEL THEY TRUST THE MICHAEL
WHO THEY SEEN PUSHING THROUGH TOUGH REFORMS AND STICKING TO HIS GUNS THE MORE THEY'VE COME TO SUPPORT THE OTHER BIT IS WHEN HE LEAVES BUILDING THE MOMENTUM PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU USE THE WORD TRUST NOW IN RELATION TO MICHAEL GOLD PEOPLE WILL JUST SORT OF TAP THE SIDE OF THE NOSE AND SAY WAR WHAT TRES FAST COME ON I THINK BORIS ABOUT THAT THEY WILL SAY I THINK THEY'LL SAY THE TRUST A MAN WHO WAS PREPARED TO MAKE THAT DECISION
WHEN HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION THAT HE FELT BORIS HAS A HUGE RANGE QUALITIES AND HAS BEEN A BRILLIANT MAYOR OF LONDON BUT HE FELT IT WASN'T THE RIGHT MATERIAL TO BE PRIME MINISTER A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SUPPORTED THAT JUDGEMENT SINCE MICHAEL MADE IT AND MICHAEL HAS NOW STEPPED UP AND SAID
HE IS READY TO LEAVE THE PARTY READY TO BE PRIME MINISTER I THINK THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS DIALECT YOU'VE GOT THIS DECISION AND IT'S RIGHT THAT THE MEMBERSHIP SHOULD HAVE THE TWO MOST EXPERIENCED CANDIDATES ONE IN EFFECT REPRESENTING REMAIN ONE REPRESENTING LEAVE BUT BOTH OF THEM VASTLY EXPERIENCED HAVING BEEN SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE CABINET FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS AND PAY MORE BURST OVER THE QUESTION A TRUST WITH YOUR CANDIDATE AS WELL WE READ IN THE TIMES THIS MORNING THAT SHE IS BEING
MISLEADING THAT'S THE WORD THEY USE BUT OVER CLAIMS ON HER C. V. NO THIS IS TOTALLY BOGUS ARTICLES THAT SHE WAS NOT GIVEN THE RIGHT TO REPLY TO AND IN CASE YOU'RE LISTEN BUSILY PUZZLED BUT IT IT IT IS TRYING TO THERE'S A CONCERTED EFFORT TO TRY AND RUBBISH ANDREAS STELLA
CAREER IN FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE IS AN INVESTMENT MANAGER AND WHAT THE THE POINT THEY MAKE IS THAT DURING TEN YEARS AT THE EVENTS AT THE THE INVESTMENT FUND IN MOSCOW PETROL SHE DID NOT HAVE ANY ROLE IN MANAGING FUNDS OR ADVISING CLIENTS DESPITE THE TITLE SENIOR INVESTMENT OFFERS INTERPRETER THEY DON'T THEY DON'T MENTION HER DECADE AT BARCLAYS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THIS IS A CONCERTED EFFORT TO RUBBISH A STELLAR CAREER AND IMPLY JUST MAKING THE TEA
WELL I WOULD I WOULD SAY IT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL FOR OUR PARTY MEMBERSHIP AND THE COUNTRY THIS IS THE PRIME MINISTER WE'RE PICKING HERE THAT WE PUT FORWARD THE BEST CANDIDATES AND I WOULD SAY TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES ON THURSDAY IF YOU ARE VOTING FOR A CANDIDATE WHO YOU DO NOT THINK HE'S THE BEST PERSON TO LEAVE US DOING SOMETHING WRONG JUST TO BE QUITE CLEAR DID SHE RUN AN INVESTMENT FUND DID SHE RUN A MANAGEMENT TEAM
YES SHE HAS SHE WELL SHE'S WORKED A DECADE A BARCLAYS AND BOTH THOSE JOBS AT BARCLAYS WAS A SILLY DID SHE WAS DOING SHE WAS DOING INVESTMENTS SHE WAS RUNNING RUNNING THE FUND SHE WAS RUNNING A FUND SHE WAS ALSO MANAGING THE GLOBAL BANKING NETWORK WE'VE PUT HER C.V. OUT THERE AND
ANDREA'S STOCK IS HIGH IN THIS AREA SHE FIRST CAME TO PROMINENCE BY HER FORENSIC CROSS EXAMINATION WHEN ON THE TREASURY TEAM SHE HAS HUGE SUPPORT HUGELY RESPECTED BY ECONOMIST BY BUSINESS PEOPLE SHE HAS TREMENDOUS SUPPORT IN THE AIR THIS AREA
AND IT IS BECAUSE SHE IS THE STRONGEST CANDIDATE ON THE ECONOMY AND THE STEWARDSHIP OF THE ECONOMY PARTICULARLY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS GOING TO BE SO CRITICAL PROBABLY THE CUP I DON'T KNOW HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE HASN'T HAD THE SORT OF EXPERIENCE WE KIND OF EXPECT FROM A PRIME MINISTER WELL RECENT PRIME MINISTERS AND CHANCELLORS HAVE NOT HAD CABINET EXPERIENCE OR INDEED ANY MINISTERIAL EXPERIENCE BEFORE TAKING OFFICE
ANDREA HAS BEEN IN GOVERNMENT HELD IMPORTANT ROLES IN GOVERNMENT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY SHE HAS REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY ON THE STEWARDSHIP OF THE YUKON ALL RIGHT AND FINANCIAL SO YOU'VE BOTH BEEN PROMOTING YOUR CANDIDATE AS ONE WOULD EXPECT TELL US WHY THE OTHER GUY SHOULDN'T GET IT ALL THE OTHER ONE SHOULDN'T GET BUSY IN THE CASE OF SOME WHY NOT
THEN ENTER A LONG TIME BUT I AS I SAY I DON'T THINK SHE HAS THE EXPERIENCE SHE'S RISEN VERY QUICKLY SHE IS AND THAT IS IMPRESSIVE AND SHE WAS A PROMINENT CAMPAIGNER FOR LEAVE BUT I THINK IF YOU CONTRAST RELATIVE INEXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT WITH MICHAEL GOES VERY HIGH LEVEL EXPERIENCE OF GOVERNMENT I JUST DON'T THINK THE TWO COMPARE MICHAEL IS VERY WELL KNOWN IN THE PARTY HE WAS HE HAD EXTREMELY POPULAR FIGURE ON
EVERY KIND OF GRASS ROOTS SURVEY AND I THINK IF HE GETS ONTO THE BALLET HE WILL ENGAGE WITH PARTY MEMBERS AND HE'LL BE A FANTASTIC PENNY MORTON WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE MICHAEL GOVE GIVEN THAT HE BEEN IN THE CABINET EDUCATION SEPARATE JUST A SECRETARY AND SO ON VERY EXPERIENCED WE NEED SOMEONE THAT'S NOT JUST GOING TO GET US THROUGH THE NEXT FEW YEARS BUT ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY THE MAKING OF US AND I'M AFRAID LOVE MY COLLEAGUES DEARLY BUT WE NEED
FRESH LEADERSHIP TO DO THAT WE NEED SOMEONE THAT CAN REINVIGORATE POLITICS WE COULD NEED SOMEONE THAT CAN UNITE THE NATION SHE'S GETTING SUPPORT OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY FROM LABOUR SUPPORTERS FROM ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE AND SHE I THINK IS IS WHAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS THANK YOU BOTH VERY MODERN AND EFFORT
# IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE FINANCIAL TIME SAYS THAT AFTER BRECK SIT IT'S CHILCOTT AS ALL THE PAPERS LOOK AHEAD TO THE PUBLICATION OF THE REPORT ON THE IRAQ WAR THE MIRROR DESCRIBED IT AS A MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR MAIL SAYS BEREAVED RELATIVES WERE FIND OUT EXACTLY WHY THEIR LOVED ONES WERE SENT TO THEIR DEATHS AMONG THE MOST EXPLOSIVE REVELATIONS IT ADDS WILL BE THE DETAILS OF TWENTY NINE SECRET LETTERS NOTES AND CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN TONY BLAIR AND PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH IN THE RUN UP TO WAR
GUARDIAN THE MIRROR THERE CERTAINLY ALL SET OUT A LIST OF QUESTIONS THEY THINK THE REPORT MUST ANSWER AMONG THE SUN'S QUESTIONS WAS THE WALL LEGAL AND WAS NINE ELEVEN A JUSTIFICATION FOR WAR GUARDIAN WANTS TO KNOW IF THE INVASION INCREASED THE RISK OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IN BRITAIN IT WAS THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN IS EXPECTED TO FULFIL A PROMISE HE MADE DURING HIS LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN TO APOLOGISE ON BEHALF OF LABOUR FOR THE ALL
# THE MALE ACCUSES THE BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR MARK CARNEY OF RELENTLESSLY TALKING BRITAIN DOWN AFTER HIS WARNING YESTERDAY THAT THE ECONOMIC RISKS OF BRECHT'S IT HAD BEGUN TO CRYSTALLISE THE PAPER SAYS THAT WITH SHARES BUOYANT THE CHEAPER POUND BOOSTING EXPORTS AND COUNTRIES QUEUING UP TO DO BUSINESS WITH POST BRECHT'S IT BRITAIN THERE'S A HUGELY OPTIMISTIC STORY TO BE TOLD THE TELEGRAPH SUGGESTS THAT A SPEECH FROM DAVID CAMERON EXTOLLING BRITAIN'S ABILITY TO OVERCOME MANY DIFFICULTIES WOULD HELP TO REASSURE A JITTERY NATION
# FINALLY HOW DO YOU FANCY KEEPING A GOAT AS A PET ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH RESEARCHERS AT QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY IN LONDON HAVE CARRIED OUT EXPERIMENTS THAT SUGGESTS GOATS COULD RIVAL DOG WAS INFORMING AN EMOTIONAL BOND WITH THEIR OWNER'S ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE STUDYING HAS TOLD THE TELEGRAPH TO GOATS GAZE AT HUMANS IN THE SAME WAY AS DOGS DO WHEN THEY'RE ASKING FOR A TREAT THAT REACH BUT THE AUTHORS ALSO WON THE GOATS ARE NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR URBAN DWELLERS BECAUSE AS THEY TOLD THE TIMES
THEY'RE SOCIABLE BUT THEY DO NEED A FEEL
WELL WHO'D HAVE GUESSED THAT SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
# THERE ARE JUST HOURS TO GO BEFORE THE LONG AWAITED REPORT INTO THE IRAQ WAR IS PUBLISHED ENQUIRY HEADED BY SIR JOHN CHILCOT WAS LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE BY THE THEN PRIME MINISTER GORDON BROWN ITS PURPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE REASONS WHY BRITAIN INVADED IRAQ HOW DECISIONS WERE MADE AND WHETHER ANY LESSONS CAN BE LEARNT FOR FUTURE CONFLICTS
ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE BRITISH PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE WAR THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND THEY'VE BEEN CRITICISMS FROM THOSE WHO SERVED THAT THE U.K. WAS UNPREPARED FOR A FULL BONE CONCH CONFLICT AND WHICH SOME SAY LED TO THE MESS THAT IRAQ IS IN NOW OUR REPORTER SEEMA COULD TOUCH HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO TWO FORMER SOLDIERS WHO WERE AMONG THE FIRST TO STEP FOOT ON IRAQI SOIL AT THE START OF THE WAR
I JUST CARRIED ON THE NICKING BREAKFAST AND THEN OPEN UP THIS ENVELOPE AND THERE IT WAS AND VERY STUCK LETTER AND A BIT OF THE PAGE NOTICE OF COMPULSORY CALL OUT LANCE CORPORAL MCMENEMY
SATURDAY FIFTEENTH FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THE DAY IN MCMENEMY FOUND OUT HE WAS BEING DEPLOYED TO IRAQ LANCE CORPORAL DAMIAN HEARNE WAS ALREADY IN KUWAIT ON STANDBY AS IT BECAME CERTAIN THAT HOSTILITIES WERE TO BEGIN WE MOVE TO PLAYSCHOOL CAN'T COYOTE WHICH IS JUST ON THE ORAC YOU EIGHT BORDER AND AS SOON AS THE DEADLINE PASSED IN WE WENT
IN THE MIDDLE OF MARCH THE AMERICANS BEGAN THEIR OFFENSIVE THE BRITISH SOON FOLLOWED
SURE ENOUGH NEXT DAY AFTER THE BOMBS ALL DROP THEM BAGHDAD THE VARIOUS LINES OF BRITISH ARMY TROOPS ALL STARTED MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS IN THE VEHICLES AND WE WERE WE WERE OVER THERE AND THEY WON
SOME OF THE SOLDIERS FELT UNPREPARED THEY SAY THEY WEREN'T GIVEN THE RIGHT KIT ALL KIT THAT WORKED PROPERLY
WERE ISSUED WITH THEIR BODY ARMOUR VESTS WERE GIVEN CERAMIC PLATES ONE FOR THE FRONT ONE FOR THE BIKE AND THAT'S WHAT STOPS UP A BLIP
THE FIRST WEEKEND TO THEIR THEIR COMBAT CAMPAIGN ITSELF WE WERE ASKED TO GIVE THEM UP MORE ASKED THAT THERE WAS OTHER TRIPS WHO WOULD BE COULD BE FATAL
PERHAPS ON FOOT AND THE ONES WHO ARE IT WANTS FOOD SHOULD HAVE THOSE CERAMIC PLATES COS HE MAY HAVE MORE NEED FOR IT AT THE TIME WE WERE ASKED TO BE WE WERE MANNING VEHICLE CHECKPOINTS ON FOOT
SO WE WERE VERY MUCH AT THAT POINT IS AS FAR AS WE WERE CONCERNED IN THE FIRING LINE AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD BE ASKED TO GIVE UP CERAMIC PLATES WHICH THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN STOPPING A BULLET NOT THERE WAS APPARENTLY A SHORTAGE OF THE RIGHT COMBAT GEAR AND MANY OF THE TROOPS WORE GREEN COMBATS RATHER THAN THE APPROPRIATE DESERT CAMOUFLAGE KIT
WHEN TONY BLAIR CAME OUT TO VISIT THE TROOPS I WAS BASED AT UNCAS SIR AND HE CAME TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE TROOPS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THE CAMPAIGN
I WAS STILL IN GREEN KIT AT THE TIMES ARE STILL IN U.K. KIT AND WE WERE TOLD BY THE CAMP SERGEANT MAJOR WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE VISIT THAT ANYBODY WHO'S IN GREEN WANTS TO STAY AWAY FROM THE PARADE DO NOT COME NEAR THE PREY TO PRIME MINISTER DOESN'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE DRESSED IN ADEQUATE ALL THE WRONG KIT IT WOULD SEND OUT THE WRONG MESSAGE THE SITUATION SOON BEGAN TO ESCALATE AND SAINT DOWN WHO SAYING WAS OUSTED FROM POWER
IN APRIL HIS STATUE WAS PULLED DOWN AND CROWDS JEERED ENCHANTED IN CELEBRATION BUT ACCORDING TO THESE MEN WHAT CAME NEXT WAS WHAT THE BRITISH MILITARY WAS COMPLETELY UNPREPARED FOR
THERE WAS NO PLANNING NO PREPARATION FOR THE BIGGIE AFTERMATH FOR D. ONE OUT OF THERE THE CONFLICT FACE BUT HE HAD NOT PLANNED IN MIND AND LOOTING WAS HAPPENING
IMMINENTLY ARE IMMEDIATELY I SHOULD SEE AFTER THEIR COMBAT FITTED FINISHED HE WOULD LITERALLY THIS NOT WILL STILL BE GOING OUT OF THE TANK AND THE PEOPLE OF THE BUILDINGS BEHIND LOOTING IT COMING OUT WITH FRIDGE FREEZER ON THE BACK IN THE TABLE IN CHEER WHEREVER YOU GET THE HANDS ON COMPLETE ANARCHY AND WE WERE TAUGHT JUST TO BACK AWAY FROM THAT NOT TO GET INVOLVED
I THINK THE BRITISH AND THE AMERICANS UNDERESTIMATED HOW FRACTIOUS ORAC WAS AND SADDAM HUSSEIN HELD THAT TOGETHER AND WITHOUT SOMEBODY LIKE HIM AT THE HELM
DEMOCRACY WAS NEVER GOING TO WORK IN AN AREA LIKE THAT WHERE THERE WAS SO MUCH DEEP ANGER AND RESENTMENT
THEY SAY IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ BEGAN VIEWING THEM WITH SUSPICION AND ANGER IN A MATTER OF MONTHS THERE WAS A CHANGE IN FEELING THEY SAY AND THAT RESULTED IN MORE DIVISION AMONG THE POPULATION AND A PERILOUS INSURGENCY
TODAY'S REPORT SHOULD ANSWER SOME CRUCIAL QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY PERSONNEL AND JOURNALISTS OVER THE YEARS WAS THE U.K.'S PARTICIPATION IN THE WAR JUSTIFIED AND WAS THE MILITARY READY FOR SUCH A COMPLEX WALL AND ITS AFTERMATH BUT EVEN BEFORE ITS PUBLICATION SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE ADMITTED THAT THEY WERE ILL PREPARED SOMETHING THAT IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS MUCH AWAITED DOCUMENT
IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST TENANTS INTO A HUGE MESS YEAH IT MAKES ME FEEL DISAPPOINTED I'M STILL PROUD OF EVERYTHING WE ACHIEVED BECAUSE WE DID THE JOB WE WE WERE TOLD TO DO BUT LOOKING ON THE FALL OUT OF IT IT'S SOMETHING I THINK IF MOST PEOPLE COULD CHANGE HISTORY THEY WOULD PROBABLY SAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO ABOUT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY
# SEEMA COULD FETCH A TALKING THERE TO PEOPLE WHO KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE IN THAT WAR THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US THIS MORNING IS LORD SINGH WHO IS THE RECTOR OF THE NETWORK OF SIKH ORGANISATIONS MORNING GOOD MORNING JOHN
IN THE RECENT MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE BRAVERY OF THOSE KILLED ON THE BATTLEFIELDS OF WORLD WAR ONE I WAS PARTICULARLY MOOD BY A PIECE IN THE TIMES BY DANIEL FINKELSTEIN ABOUT THE COURAGE OF BIRTH HIS PATERNAL AND MATERNAL GODFATHERS
GRANDFATHERS BOTH REGARDED THE MICHELLE SHE WAS INTENSELY PATRIOTIC AND BOTH WERE DECORATED FOR THEIR HEROISM HOWEVER THERE WERE ON THE GERMAN SIDE OF THE CONFLICT COURAGE CAN BE FOUND IN BOTH FRIEND AND FELLOW AND PATRIOTISM IS ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE
WELL IT'S RIGHT AND PROPER TO HONOUR THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY WILL NEVER LEARN FROM HISTORY IF WE FAILED TO REFLECT ON ITS LESSONS THIS THOUGHT IT WAS IN THE MIND OF THE QUEEN'S GRANDFATHER KING GEORGE THE FIFTH AS YOU LOOKED UPON ROWS AND ROWS OF ENDLESS GREAT USE IN FLANDERS AND COMMENTED THAT WE WILL HAVE FAILED TO HONOUR THE MEMORIES OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR ALL IF WE ALLOW SUCH SLAUGHTER TO EVER OCCUR AGAIN
LATER GENERATIONS WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF HINDSIGHT NEED TO ASK QUESTIONS LIKE DID THE WAR ADVANCED THE CAUSE OF PEACE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE IN EUROPE OR ELSEWHERE
AND DID THE PUNITIVE REPARATIONS DEMANDED OF GERMANY IN ANY WAY CONTRIBUTED TO THE RISE OF ADOLF HITLER
TODAY WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THE LONG DELAYED CHILCOT INQUIRY INTO THE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WAR IN IRAQ THERE WILL ALSO BE SIMILAR QUESTIONS AND INEVITABLE RECRIMINATIONS
WHAT IS BEYOND DISPUTE IS THAT THE LONG SUFFERING PEOPLE AFTER YOUR OUTBACK ARE AS WE SAW IN THE WEEKEND TERRORIST OUTRAGE IN A SHOPPING MALL IN BAGHDAD AND THE DEATH OF MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE STILL FAR FROM HOPE FOR PEACE AND TRUE DEMOCRACY
I WAS RECENTLY INVITED TO THE FORMAL UNVEILING FOR BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED SHORT PRAYER INCLUDED IN PRAYERS SAID BEFORE THE START OF FORMAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE LORDS
IT REMINDS PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT ALL SELFISH INTERESTS AND PARTIAL AFFECTIONS TO ONE SIDE IN DELIBERATION
IT'S REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE SIKH DAILY PRAYER NEAR THUS THE CONCLUDE SEEKS SERVICE IS IN GOOD LARA'S AND CLOSES WITH THE WORDS SO THAT COUPLER AND PLEDGE TO WORK FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF ALL
SUCH SENTIMENT SHOULD BE CENTRAL TO ALL DEBATE AND POLITICAL DECISION MAKING IN HELPING US TO REFLECT OBJECTIVELY ON THE PAST AND WORK TOGETHER TOWARDS A BETTER FUTURE
# THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH LORD SAYING THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT THE N.H.S. SET ASIDE TWENTY SIX POINT ONE BILLION POUNDS LAST YEAR TO COVER THE COSTS OF COMPENSATION FOR MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE THAT IS A QUARTER OF ITS ENTIRE BUDGET EVERY YEAR TO PAY FOR ITS MISTAKES
THE LATEST JUDGEMENT AGAINST IT CAME YESTERDAY WHEN A HIGH COURT JUDGE ORDERED A SETTLEMENT OF ELEVEN MILLION POUNDS TO A MOTHER WHOSE CHILD WAS BORN WITH SEVERE CEREBRAL PALSY SHE GAVE BIRTH AT KING GEORGE HOSPITAL PART OF BARKING HE RING IN REDBRIDGE N.H.S. TRUST
AND SHE'S IN A RADIO CAR NOW AND I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE HER REAL NAME BUT WE SHALL CALL HER JANE OR HER SOLICITOR EDWINA RAWSON FROM TH ER FIELD FISHER IS HERE WITH ME IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH
MORNING HER JANE CAN YOU TAKE US BACK TO
THE TIME YOUR SON WAS BORN AND WHEN YOU FIRST REALISED SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG
O.K. SO I'VE GONE TO THE HOSPITAL'S WHO EATS PREY ARE I HAVE A CHECK UP EVERYTHING SEEMS O.K.
WHEN I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL THE FIRST THING THAT ACTUALLY SAID TO ME WAS THAT I SHOULDN'T BE AT THIS HOSPITAL I SHOULD BE BASE ANOTHER HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEIR PREGNANCY WAS HIGH RISK ANYWAY BUT RATHER THAN TRANSFER ME THERE IN SIZE TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO KEEP ME BEAR WHAT'S THE PREGNANCY THE LABOUR ALBUS VERY UM VERY INTENSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IT'S VERY HARD SIR
MY SON'S IN DISTRESS AT ONE POINT MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS HIGH SO VERY TRAUMATIC AND I WAS IN A DILATING THE WAY THEY WANT BE SOCIETY IT'S ABOUT THEY KIND OF JUST SAID WELL LEAVE IT TO NATURE UM I CAN SEW
THE POINT OF BEING IN LABOUR WHEN I WAS READY TO GIVE BIRTH TO MY SON WHEN HE WAS BORN AT IT'S OF IT WAS WRONG WHEN HE WAS CRYING AND HE WAS COMPLETELY STILL WASN'T CRYING AND THAT'S WHEN
ALL OF THE DOTS HAS RUSHED TO HIM AND IT'S HER WORK AND MY SON BUT PRIOR TO THAT I HADN'T SEEN MUCH DOCTORS IT WAS JUST DIFFERENT NURSES IN AND OUT IN AND
THAT'S WHEN I THAT RECKON I'M A FAN AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WHEN I DIDN'T HEAR THAT CRY BECAUSE HE WASN'T ACTUALLY BREATHING WHEN HE WAS BORN BUT THEY HAVE SINCE ESTABLISHED THAT
THE STAFF HAD SPOTTED THE PROBLEM AND GIVEN YOU A CAESAREAN JUST FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE THEN
THE CHANCES ARE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE HE WOULD'VE BEEN BORN YES AND THAT THAT'S THE BITTERSWEET
IN ESSENCE OF THIS WHOLE SITUATION FOR ME THE FACT THAT I WENT INTO A SPORTS HALL ON THE FOURTEENTH OF APRIL I GAVE BIRTH TO MY SON ON THE FIFTEENTH OF APRIL IN THE MORNING AND ONE MINUTE EIGHT IN THE MORNING AND I WAS IN HOSPITAL FOR NINE O'CLOCK
AND THE FORCE TEN SO THERE WAS LIKE A BIG WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO DO SOMETHING AND THE FACT THAT IT'S A SORRY FORGIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING BUT YOUR SON'S NOW NINE SO IT'S TAKEN AN AWFUL LONG TIME TO GET TO THIS POINT WHERE THEY ARE APOLOGISE I THINK WE'VE APOLOGISED BEFORE BUT YOU HAVE THIS SETTLEMENT THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY ELEVEN MILLION POUNDS GOING TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
IT WILL SEE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING FOR THE RESOURCES THAT MY SON NEEDS CARE ALL SAY
WHEN WE WERE DEPENDENT ON THE COUNCIL ABOUT THE CARE THAT WE WERE GUESSING FOR MY SON WAS NEXT AND I THINK WE WERE GETTING FREE ABBOTS A WEEK AND EVEN THEN I WAS A BIG BATTLE FOR ME JUST TO GET THOSE THREE HOURS CONSIDERING THAT MY SUMMERS AND HIGHER RATE DISABILITY AND MOBILITY AND I'M A SINGLE PARENT AND I HAD TO GO FREE CHERRY ORGANISATIONS TSCHUSS TO SECURE THAT THREE HOURS A WEEK MY SON SAY THAT THE COMPENSATION IN REGARDS TO PROVIDE AND EQUIPMENT THERAPY
ALL THE THINGS THAT HE NATURALLY BE GETTING OFF THE N.H.S. AND HAS A SERVICE BECAUSE OF HIS CONDITION THE THINGS I'VE HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH NOW I CAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE MEANS ACTUALLY GET WHAT HE NEEDS TO GIVE HIM A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE LET ME BRING IT RAWSON NOW WHO'LL I SAYS A SOLICITOR YOU WANT YOU DEAL WITH A LOT OF THESE CASES I MEAN IT'S QUITE A STARTLING FIGURE THAT A QUARTER OF THE WHOLE OF THE N.H.S. BUDGET HAS TO GO ON BASICALLY MISTAKES
YES I AGREE WITH THAT COMPLETELY AND WHAT I REALLY DO WANT TO SEE IS WE HAVE AN N.H.S. WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THESE MISTAKES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO REALLY BE AWARE OF AS WELL IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF MISTAKES THAT ARE MADE
IN TREATMENT ON THE N.H.S. THAT DON'T RESULT AND CAN'T RESULT IN COMPENSATION BECAUSE THE LAW RECOGNISES THAT SOME DOCTORS DO MAKE MISTAKES BUT THESE MISTAKES THESE PAYOUTS ARFUR VERY VERY VERY SERIOUS MISTAKES
MISTAKES WHICH ARE SO UNREASONABLE BUT NO REASONABLE DOCTOR COULD'VE GIVEN TREATMENT IN THAT WAY AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM
THE PROBLEM IS TO BE A DRESS WE NEED TO LOOK MORE CAREFULLY AT THE MISTAKES THAT ARE BEING MADE I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS IT'S THE SAME MISTAKES THEY COME UP TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND IT'S UPSETTING SO THOSE WHO MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO THINK THAT WITH THIS HE'S GONE MAD THAT IT WOULD WIN SUCH A LITIGIOUS SOCIETY YOU'RE SAYING NO THAT'S NOT I AM ABSOLUTELY SAYING NO
I GET SO MANY PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE THINKING THAT THEY'VE GOT A CASE AND WOULD LIKE ME TO DO A CASE FOR THEM BUT AN AWFUL LOT OF THEM WE JUST CAN'T HAVE MISTAKES DO HAPPEN
# EDWINA RAWSON AND JANE AS WELL AS RECORDING YOU THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST ALEX I THREW US JOHN GOOD MORNING BUT A BIT OF A CHILLY START TO THE DAY TEMPERATURES RISING NOW THANKS TO THE HELP OF SOME SUNSHINE WILL BE A FINE SUMMER'S DAY FOR MOST THERE ARE SOME DETAILED DIFFERENCES THOUGH IT SPLITS INTO FOUR AREAS FOR TODAY LET'S START WITH SOUTH EAST ENGLAND SOUTH WEST ENGLAND EASTERN ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS WALES AND NORTH EAST ENGLAND

SO WHAT YOU DOING ERIC HERE TROUBLE AT ONE OF YOUR CLUBS BRIEF LIVES RETURNS NEXT MONDAY AFTERNOON AT TWO FIFTEEN AND AVAILABLE ON THE B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WEBSITE
LATER ON THIS PROGRAMME MUSICAL PRODIGY WHO'S COMPOSED AN ENTIRE VIOLIN CONCERTO AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN AND TIM HENMAN ON ANDY MURRAY YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY
# IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE SIXTH OF JULY THE HEADLINES SO JOHN CHILCOTT REPORT ON BRITAIN'S ROLE IN THE IRAQ WAR WILL BE PUBLISHED THIS MORNING AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTAIN CRITICISM OF TONY BLAIR THE MILITARY AND THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
# ONLY THREE CANDIDATES REMAIN IN THE CONTEST TO BE CONSERVATIVE LEADER WITH THERESA MAY WAY AHEAD AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF VOTING AND WHALES ARE PREPARING TO TAKE ON PORTUGAL FOR A PLACE IN THE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN FINAL THE B.B.C. NEWS
# SEMI FINAL RATHER THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY NEIL SLEET MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS AFTER IT WAS SET UP THE CHILCOT INQUIRY INTO THE IRAQ WAR WILL PUBLISH ITS FINDINGS THIS MORNING IT'S MORE THAN THIRTEEN YEARS SINCE TONY BLAIR COMMITTED BRITISH FORCES TO THE U.S. LED INVASION SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS TOPPLED QUICKLY BUT IRAQ HAS BEEN RIVEN BY SECTARIAN CONFLICT EVER SINCE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF IRAQIS DIED ALONG WITH ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE U.K. SERVICE PERSONNEL
CLAIMS THAT THE IRAQI LEADER HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION PROVED UNFOUNDED TONY BLAIR HAS SAID THAT HE DOES NOT REGRET REMOVING A BEAUT BRUTAL DICTATOR THE INQUIRY WAS ASKED TO IDENTIFY WHAT LESSONS SHOULD BE LEARNED ITS CHAIRMAN SIR JOHN CHILCOT IT SAID HE HOPES FUTURE MILITARY ACTION WON'T BE LAUNCHED WITHOUT MORE RIGOUROUS ANALYSIS HE'S OUR CORRESPONDENT PETER HUNT
THE TASK WAS DAUNTING TO INVESTIGATE THE BUILD UP TO WAR THE MILITARY ACTION AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE U.K.'S RESPONSE IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THE REPORT FILLS TWELVE VOLUMES CONTAINS TWO POINT SIX MILLION WORDS AND IS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE LENGTH OF WAR AND PEACE
THOSE CRITICAL OF TONY BLAIR'S LEGACY DEFINING DECISION TO GO TO WAR WILL FOCUS INITIALLY ON THE CONTENTS OF TWENTY NINE MEMOS THE LABOUR PRIME MINISTER SENT THE U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH DO THEY CONTAIN PRIVATE PROMISES OF SUPPORT WHICH WEREN'T MADE PUBLIC AT THE TIME
WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED FOR WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THE WARS LEGALITY AND THE PLANNING FOR THE AFTERMATH SIR JOHN CHILCOT HAS OUTLINED WHAT HE HOPED THE REPORT'S PUBLICATION WOULD ACHIEVE
THE MAIN EXPECTATION THAT I HAVE IS THAT IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE IN FUTURE TO ENGAGE IN A MILITARY OR INDEED A DIPLOMATIC ENDEAVOUR ON SUCH A SCALE AND OF SUCH GRAVITY WITHOUT REALLY CAREFUL
CHALLENGE ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTIVE POLITICAL JUDGEMENT BEING APPLIED TO IT
JOHN ALSO SAID HIS COMMITTEE HAVEN'T SHIED AWAY FROM CRITICISING INDIVIDUALS WHERE THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTED SUCH FINDINGS
ANTI WAR CAMPAIGNERS WILL STAGE A DEMONSTRATION IN WESTMINSTER AS SIR JOHN PRESENTS HIS REPORT LEADERS OF THE STOP THE WAR COALITION C. N. D. AND OTHER GROUPS WILL DEMAND TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND RELATIVES OF SOME OF THE BRITISH SOLDIERS KILLED IN IRAQ HAVE JOINED CALLS FOR TONY BLAIR TO BE CHARGED WITH WAR CRIMES CURRENT THORNTON SON LEE DIED IN BASRA IN TWO THOUSAND SIX SHE TOLD US SHE WASN'T OPTIMISTIC THAT THE REPORT WOULD DELIVER JUSTICE
WHAT I'VE HEARD IS NOBODY'S GOING TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO LIGHT SHOULD BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE TRIED TO WALK AT WAR CRIMES THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH SO MANY PEOPLE
IRAQI OFFICIALS SAY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE NOW KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A SUICIDE BOMBING IN BAGHDAD ON SUNDAY HAS RISEN TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THE ATTACK CLAIMED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IS THE DEADLIEST IN THE IRAQI CAPITAL SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE INVASION AND MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BOWEN IS IN BAGHDAD
IRAQIS ARE TOO TIED UP IN THE DIFFICULTIES OF DAILY LIFE TO WORRY MUCH ABOUT BRITAIN'S INQUIRY BUT AFTER PRAYERS AT THE MAIN SUNNI MOSQUE IN BAGHDAD ON THE LAST NIGHT OF RAMADAN A GROUP OF MEN WAS SCATHING ABOUT BRITAIN AND AMERICA'S ROLE IN THE INVASION WHICH THEY SAID HAD DESTROYED IRAQ ONE MAN ALSO SAID HE FEARED FOR HIS LIFE IF HE WAS SEEN TALKING TO A JOURNALIST
IRAQ HAD BIG PROBLEMS BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE BUT THE INVASION OPENED THEIR DOORS TO AN INFLUX OF JIHADISTS AND THE AMERICANS IMPOSED A POLITICAL SYSTEM BASED ON SECTARIANISM WHICH THE BED AT THE MOSQUE SAID
BUT IRAQ ON THE ROAD TO SECTARIAN WAR AS UNSCRUPULOUS LEADERS MANIPULATED THE FEARS OF SHIAS AND SUNNIS TO TRY TO HOLD ON TO POWER OR TO SEIZE IT
# THERESA MAY SAID SHE'S THE ONLY CANDIDATE LEFT IN THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST WHO CAN UNITE THE PARTY THE HOME SECRETARY HAD A BIG LEAD AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF VOTING WINNING THE SUPPORT OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE TORY M.P.S HALF THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY HER CLOSEST RIVAL ANDREA LEAD SOME RECEIVED SIXTY SIX VOTES WITH MICHAEL GO THIRD ON FORTY EIGHT BOTH LIAM FOX WHO FINISHED LAST AND WAS ELIMINATED AND STEPHEN CRAB WHO WITHDREW HAVE SAID THEY WILL SUPPORT MISSUS MAY HE'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALEX FORSYTH
AFTER ONE ROUND OF VOTING IN WESTMINSTER THERE ARE JUST THREE CANDIDATES LEFT IN THIS RACE ONLY TWO NAMES WILL GO FORWARD TO CONSERVATIVE PARTY MEMBERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO WILL CHOOSE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY'S CURRENT LEAD AMONG EM PEAS PUTS HER IN POLE POSITION TO MAKE THE FINAL BALLOT THE BATTLE IS NOW BETWEEN ANDREA LEADS SOME AND MICHAEL GO FOR SECOND PLACE
BOTH BRECK'S IT BACKERS MY GAVE LAST NIGHT HIGHLIGHTED HIS EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT SAYING HIS WORKERS THE FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY AND CURRENT JUSTICE SECRETARY PROVED HE COULD DRIVE CHANGE IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION
SUPPORTERS OF MISSUS LED SOME THE ENERGY MINISTER HAVE SOUGHT TO MAKE A VIRTUE OF HER EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE POLITICS CITING HER BACKGROUND IN BUSINESS AND FINANCE BOTH CAMPS WILL BE CANVASSING HARD AMONG EM PEAS BEFORE THEY VOTE AGAIN TOMORROW AND THERESA MAY'S TEAM WHILE BUOYED BY HER SUPPORT IN PARLIAMENT WILL BE FAR FROM COMPLACENT WHERE THE MOOD AMONG PARTY MEMBERS IS HARD TO PREDICT
# THE POUND HAS FALLEN TO HER NEW THIRTY ONE YEAR LOW AGAINST THE DOLLAR DURING TRADING IN THE FAR EAST AMID HEIGHTENED FEARS ABOUT BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION AT ONE POINT STERLING DROPPED BELOW ONE DOLLAR TWENTY EIGHT BEFORE RECOVERING SLIGHTLY
# ONE OF LONDON'S BUSIEST AND E. DEPARTMENTS HAS BEEN ORDERED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AFTER INSPECTORS RATED SERVICES AS INADEQUATE THE CARE QUALITY COMMISSION FOUND THAT NORTH MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL TRUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS THAT ON ONE OCCASION THE PATIENT LAY DEAD FOR UP TO FOUR AND A HALF HOURS BEFORE BEING FOUND
THE DEPARTMENT LOGS TWENTY TWO SERIOUS INCIDENTS IN THE PAST YEAR THE HOSPITAL SAID IT WAS EXTREMELY SORRY FOR THE PROBLEMS THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF HOSPITALS SO MIKE RICHARDS TOLD US THE LACK OF GOOD LEADERSHIP WAS AT THE HEART OF THE PROBLEMS
I THINK THE LEADERSHIP ISSUE IS REALLY THE CRITICAL ONE AND SO THAT THE JUNIOR STAFF WERE NOT SUPPORTED LAW WITH A MIDDLE GRADE DOCTORS SO AND THERE WERE TOO FEW CONSULTANTS BUT NOR WERE PEOPLE BEING ATTRACTED TO WORK IN THAT DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR POOR LEADERSHIP
# PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS MADE HIS FIRST APPEARANCE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN SUPPORT OF HILLARY CLINTON'S BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING HE WAS READY TO PASS THE BAT ON TO HURT HE ATTENDED A RALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA JUST HOURS AFTER THE F.B.I. CRITICISED MISSUS CLINTON'S HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL WHILE SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE BUT OFFICIAL SAID SHE WOULDN'T FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES MISTER OBAMA TOLD THE CROWD OF CLINTON'S SUPPORTERS THAT NO ONE WAS BETTER QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT
HILLARY CLINTON THERE TO BE THEN THAT'S PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF THE DECISION NOT TO CHARGE MISSUS CLINTON HAS ANGERED HER REPUBLICAN RIVAL FOR THE PRESIDENCY DONALD TRUMP I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I ALWAYS FELT THAT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD ESCAPE CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR A DANGEROUS AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOUR
BECAUSE I ALWAYS KNOW AND I ALWAYS SEE AND IT
THAT OUR SYSTEM IS IN FACT RIG IT'S TOTALLY RICK OH KAY IT'S CORRUPT IT'S RIGGED IT'S DISGRACEFUL
# B.B.C. NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT PRISON OFFICERS HAVE WITHDRAWN LABOUR OR STAGED UNOFFICIAL WALK OUTS AT FIVE PRISONS IN ENGLAND BECAUSE OF SAFETY FEARS THE PRISON OFFICERS' ASSOCIATION WHOSE MEMBERS ARE BANNED FROM GOING ON STRIKE SO THERE WERE NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND ASSAULTS ON STAFF LAST YEAR THE HIGHEST NUMBER FOR AT LEAST A DECADE HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
ALTHOUGH TWO OF THE STAFF WALKOUTS AT WETHERBY YOUNG OFFENDERS INSTITUTION IN WEST YORKSHIRE AND WORMWOOD SCRUBS IN WEST LONDON WERE KNOWN ABOUT DETAILS OF THE OTHER THREE HAVE ONLY JUST EMERGED IN MAY FOR MEMBERS OF STAFF REFUSED TO CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES AT THE MOUNT PRISON IN HERTFORDSHIRE WHILE FORTY PRISON OFFICERS AT HOME HOUSE JAIL IN COUNTY DURHAM WITHDREW IN PROTEST ABOUT CHANGES TO THE REGIME
THE LATEST UNOFFICIAL ACTION OCCURRED LAST MONTH WHEN OFFICERS ON TWO WINGS AT SWINTON HALL IN STAFFORDSHIRE LEFT PRISONERS LOCKED IN THEIR CELLS BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE HAS ANNOUNCED EXTRA FUNDING OF ALMOST THIRTEEN MILLION POUNDS TO IMPROVE SAFETY IN SIXTY NINE PRISONS INCLUDING FOUR OF THOSE WHERE STAFF HAVE TAKEN ACTION
# THE SOUTH AFRICAN ATHLETE OSCAR PISTORIUS IS EXPECTED TO LEARN TODAY WHETHER HE'LL GO TO JAIL FOR THE MURDER OF HIS GIRLFRIEND'S READER STAY IN CAMP HE COULD NOW FACE A SENTENCE OF FIFTEEN YEARS IN JAIL WHALES FACE THE BIGGEST FOOTBALL MATCH IN THEIR HISTORY TONIGHT WHEN THEY TAKE ON PORTUGAL FOR A PLACE IN THE FINAL OF EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN THOUSANDS OF FANS HAVE DESCENDED ON LEON WANT TO WATCH THE GAME FROM WHERE A SPORTS EDITOR DAN ROWAN REPORTS
# WALES HAVE UPSET THE ODDS IN A WAY SCARCELY BELIEVABLE IN FRANCE THEIR SKILL AND SPIRIT SEEING THEM FINISHED TOP OF THEIR GROUP AND THEN BEAT HIGHLY FANCIED BELGIUM TO BECOME GENUINE CONTENDERS NOW PORTUGAL STAND IN THEIR WAY MUCH OF THE BUILD UP HAS FOCUSED ON THE DUEL BETWEEN TWO FOOTBALLING SUPERSTARS WALES TALISMAN GARETH BALE AND HIS REAL MADRID TEAM MATE CRISTIANO RONALDO

# AMONG THE MANY QUESTIONS THE CHILCOTT REPORT SUPPOSED TO ANSWER TODAY IS WHETHER THE WAR IN IRAQ WAS A LEGAL WALL WHERE THE PARLIAMENT WAS MISLED INTO GIVING ITS APPROVAL WHETHER THE INTELLIGENCE PRODUCE TO SUPPORT THE INVASION HAD BEEN MANIPULATED THAT ARE SOME QUESTIONS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT HAD BEEN ANSWERED LONG SINCE THE EFFECT THE WAR HAS HAD ON IRAQ ITSELF AND THE WIDER MIDDLE EAST AND OF COURSE ON THE BRITISH MILITARY WHO TOOK PART IN THE INVASION A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE MEN AND WOMEN DIED THEIR FAMILIES ARE AMONG THE MANY WHO HAVE BEEN PRESSING FOR ANSWERS
BRITISH SOLDIERS FINALLY TOOK DOWN THEIR FLAG IN SOUTHERN IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AFTER A CAMPAIGN THAT HAD EFFECTIVELY BEGUN SIX YEARS EARLIER IN THE UNITED STATES
ON A DOOR WILL COME TO THE UNITED NATIONS HIS EXCELLENCY MISTER GEORGE W. BUSH AND TO INVITE HIM ADDRESS THE GENERAL
ON AMERICAN YEAR AGO WE SAW THE DESTRUCTIVE INTENTIONS ARE VERY ENEMIES AND OUR GREATEST FEAR IS THAT TERRORIST WILL FIND A SHORT CUT TO THEIR MERDE AMBITIONS WHEN AN OUTLAW REGIME SUPPLIES THEM WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES
TO CURE ON A MASSIVE SCALE IN ONE PLACE AND ONE REGIME
WE FIND ALL THESE DANGEROUS IN A MOST LETHAL IN AGGRESSIVE FORMS
TODAY WE PUBLISHED A FIFTY PAGE DOSSIER DETAILING THE HISTORY OF IRAQ'S WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION PROGRAMME
IT'S BREACH OF U.N. RESOLUTIONS AND THE CURRENT ATTEMPTS TO REBUILD THAT ILLEGAL PROGRAMME
MUST DEMONSTRATE ASIANS ARE TAKING PLACE AROUND THE WORLD THIS WEEKEND IN PROTEST AGAINST A POSSIBLE WAR WITH IRAQ THEY START
I'M HERE BECAUSE OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING LAST TEAM UPSON AT THEY BELIEVE HERE IN THE START SEEING THERE IS ADJUST COURSE TO GO TOWARDS PEAKING AT THE RALLY AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF WHICH SHE WAS ONLY RECENTLY A MEMBER MO MOWLAM
ALL THEIR WORK IS TO BE THEIR BURST REQUIRED
THERE WAS A MOMENT OF DISSENT OR YOUNG IRAQI WOMAN LIVING IN LONDON NO ONE HERE HAS ANY CONTACT WITH THE TRUE UNRESTRICTED OPINION INSIDE IRAQ EVERYONE INSIDE IRAQ WANTS A SADDAM RID OF AND THEY ARE REALISTIC IN KNOWING THAT THEY CANNOT GET RID OF HIM THEMSELVES BECAUSE OVER HALF A MILLION IRAQIS HAVE DIED TRYING TO GET RID OF
BUT I INTEND TO JOIN THOSE TOMORROW NIGHT
WHO VOTE AGAINST MILITARY ACTION
IS FOR THAT REASON AND THAT REASON ALONE AND WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I RESIGN FROM THE
ON TUESDAY NIGHT I GAVE THE ORDER FOR BRITISH FORCES TO TAKE PART IN MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ
TONIGHT BRITISH SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN ARE ENGAGED FROM AIR LAND AND SEA THEIR MISSION TO REMOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM POWER AND DISARM IRAQ OF ITS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY BOMBING HERE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS BUT JUST BEFORE THAT THERE WOULD BE
KILLER DISPLAY OR MILITARY THAT MANY OF US THERE
THANK YOU FOR THE IVORY WENT UP BLANE EAMONN
IT'S BLUE PARATROOPERS ENCOUNTERED SOME RESISTANCE FROM PARAMILITARY FORCES AS THEY ENTERED BASRA
PARTS OF THE CITY THE STILL NOT UNDER THEIR CONTROL BUT TODAY HE'S CHEERING CROWDS FLOCKED TO SEE THEM
BRITISH TROOPS WERE PATROLLING WITH EASE RIGHT THROUGH THE CITY CENTRE WITH A STATION FOR YOU RIGHT
PEOPLE ABOUT FRIENDLY THEY'LL ASSUME VERY PLEASED
SO FAR OF COURSE WE DO NOT KNOW THE FATE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN OR JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO A SENIOR OFFICIAL TELLING US THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HIS WHEREABOUTS MAY BE AS WELL IS THAT TOP ADVISERS CLOSE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
BUT THE BRITISH ARE STILL TRYING TO CRUSH DANGEROUS POCKETS OF RESISTANCE
BRITISH COMMANDERS ARE WORRIED THEY NOW FACE A GUERRILLA STYLE INSURGENCY
WHAT WE'RE NOW SEEING IS ELEMENTS FIGHTING OR SLIGHTLY MORE IRREGULAR BATTLE POSITIONING THEMSELVES IN THE BUILT UP AREAS AND COMING OUT TO THREATEN US
TANGO TWO ONE BROTHER WE ARE RECEIVING HARASSING OCCASIONAL FIRE FROM THE NORTH WEST
A BRITISH SOLDIER HAS BEEN KILLED IN ACTION IN SOUTHERN IRAQ HE DIED THIS MORNING AT SOUTH WEST OF BASRA SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WELL ANOTHER BRITISH SOLDIER KILLED IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SO CALLED FRIENDLY FIRE INCIDENT GROUP CAPTAIN AL LOCKWOOD IS THE BRITISH ARMY SPOKESMAN
THE SECTARIAN DIVIDE IT DOES SEEM TO BE GROWING IN PARTS OF IRAQ OF THE DOZENS OF ATTACKS BY SUNNI INSURGENTS MANY HAVE BEEN TARGETED AT THE SHIA MUSLIMS WELL IT DUST IF THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF MIGHT BE THERE WILL BE A WAR BETWEEN US AND THE SOUNESS I WILL BE A FIGHT AND THAT WILL COME SOON
AT THE PUB
GOOD EVENING HE EVEN COMPARED HER DAILY LEVELS OF VIOLENCE THAT RAVAGE IRAQ TODAY MARKS A NEW AND BLOODY LOW MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A COORDINATED SERIES OF CAR BOMBINGS AND MORTAR ATTACKS IN THE HOSPITAL INSIDE A CITY THE FACES OF THE SHIA WOUNDED TOLD THE WHOLE STORY
CONFUSION PAIN AND FEAR
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED POLITICIANS HAVE NOT BROUGHT PEACE INSTEAD ARMED MILITIAS ARE SETTING THE AGENDA ON THE WORST DAY FOR BOMBINGS IN BAGHDAD SINCE THE FALL OF SADDAM
IF YOU TAKE THE LONG VIEW WHICH IS WHAT I TRY AND DO IRAQ IN NINETEEN NINETY SADDAM I TO SAY HAD THE CHOICE OF EITHER GETTING HIS NUCLEAR BOMB WHICH YOU VERY NEARLY HAD GOT HOLD OF WORLD INVADING KUWAIT HE COULD DO EITHER FORTUNATELY FOR US QUIT FIRST
NEVER GOT HOLD OF THIS BOMB AND NOW HE CAN'T DO EITHER THICK SO YOU TAKE IT OVER THE LONG RUN I THINK THE POLICY REGIME CHANGE WAS JUST
LIKE A HOLIDAY FOR THE FAMILY REALLY NICKING OR THE LEAD UP TO THAT I OR Y. AND AND MY REPLACEMENT YEAH I'M PROTECT
WHEN PLAYING THE BOY'S MAGNO UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU THINK LOOK AT THE DATE EVER BUNCH THEY ARE THEN DID NEED CLEAN OR WHY
THE ARCHIVE MATERIAL IN THAT MONTAGE WERE SUPPLIED TO US UNITED NATION MATERIAL ALL THAT WAS SUPPLIED TO US BY C.N.N.
LET ME TURN TO EMMA SKY A FORMER BRITISH DIPLOMAT IN A ROW ACTUALLY WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT HER EXPERIENCES THE UNRAVELLING THE HIGH HOPES AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES IN IRAQ AND THE STORY OF HOW YOU CAME TO BE THE GOVERNING A WHOLE DISTRICT OF IRAQ IS REALLY QUITE EXTRAORDINARY DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE DOING THAT DID YOU
NO NOT AT ALL I MEAN AFTER THE INVASION THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SENT OUT AN EMAIL ASKING FOR VOLUNTEERS TO GO OUT TO IRAQ TO ADMINISTER THE COUNTRY FOR THREE MONTHS IF WE HANDED IT BACK TO THE IRAQIS
AND I WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS VERY MUCH AGAINST THE WARM BUT I WANTED TO GO OUT TO IRAQ TO IRAQ TO APOLOGISE TO IRAQIS FOR THE WAR AND TO HELP THEM REBUILD THEIR COUNTRY I DON'T WANT THE ONLY WESTERNER THEY HAVE ARE MET TO BE A MAN WITH THE GUN AND I'VE HAD A DECADE WORKING IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES SO I HAD SOME USEFUL SKILLS TO CONTRIBUTE
BUT BEFORE I LEFT THE U.K. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT MY JOB WAS GOING TO BE NOBODY TOLD YOU NOBODY SAID WE ACTUALLY WANTED TO DO A VERY SENIOR VERY RESPONSIBLE GOVERNING THE ROLE NOT AT ALL I DON'T THINK PEOPLE HAD EVEN THOUGHT THAT FAR AHEAD EXTRAORDINARY I WAS JUST TOLD GET R.A.F. BRIZE NORTON JUMP ON THE PLANE TO BASRA
WHERE I'LL BE MET AT THE AIRPORT BY SOMEBODY HOLDING A SIGN WITH MY NAME ON IT AND TAKEN TO THE NEAREST HOTEL HAS BASRA WAS WOKING OR SOMETHING WHEN HE WAS THREE MONTHS AFTER THE INVASION THE WAR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OVER I THOUGHT IT SOUNDED PLAUSIBLE I THOUGHT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT MUST KNOW WHAT IT WAS DOING THEY JUST HADN'T TOLD ME
REALLY SO WHEN YOU SAW THAT QUITE THE OPPOSITE WAS THE CASE WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION WELL I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS I GOT TO BASRA WHEN NOBODY WAS EXPECTING ME THERE WAS NOBODY THERE TO MEET ME OR ANYTHING
SO WHAT I THEN THE NEXT DAY HE TOOK ANOTHER PLANE UP TO BAGHDAD I MADE MY WAY TO THE PUBLICAN PALACE WHICH IS TO BE SADDAM'S PALACE WAS NUMB HEADQUARTERS OF THE COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY AND I SAID HI I'M EMMA FROM ENGLAND COME TO VOLUNTEER
AND THERE I WAS YOU MY FIRST BRIEFING THAT WAS FROM A BRITISH COLONEL WHO TOLD ME THE SITUATION IN IRAQ WAS STABLE AND THINGS WOULD BE FINE
AND THEN OFF YOU WENT TO YOUR PROVINCE THIS I'VE GOT ENOUGH PEOPLE IN BAGHDAD TRY THE NORTH SO YOU WERE JUST KIND OF FARMED OUT YOU WERE JUST SORT OF TOLD GO AND SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO YES I FEEL UP TO MO'S ON THE SAID WE'VE GOT SOMEBODY HERE KEEP ON GOING TO KEPT ON GOING AND WHEN I ARRIVED IN COOK COOK THEY SAID YOU ARE THE SENIOR CIVILIAN YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THE PROVINCE REPORTING DIRECTLY TO AMBASSADOR BRAM OTHER HEAD OF THE COALITION IN BAGHDAD EXTRAORDINARY NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN YOUR LIFE BEFORE
NO I'VE NEVER MANAGED TO TOWN IN BRITAIN THAT ALONE RUN A PROVINCE IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S COUNTRY A PROVINCE THAT WAS ACTUALLY AS WE STILL AT WAR IN EFFECT OH YES THEN I REALISED IRAQIS TO MY NEW ROLE SERIOUSLY WHEN IN MY FIRST WEEK INKLE COOK AND SURGEONS TRIED TO ASSASSINATE ME REALLY
THAT WAS JUST WEAK ONE IN THE FIRST WEEK THEY HAVE THEY TRIED TO KILL IT YES THEY CAME TO THE HOUSE THAT I WAS LIVING AND IN DOWNTOWN COOK COOK AND FIRED FIVE ROCKETS INTO A FIVE HOUR PEACHES INTO THE HOUSE WITH ME AND ATE AND HOW LUCKY TO ESCAPE WHEN I WAS VERY LUCKY
AND THE REASON ALL OF THIS IS IMPORTANT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT NOW ALL THESE YEARS AFTER THE SIERRA THE EVENT IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS CHILCOTT HAS TO FIND HIS WHETHER WE MADE THE RIGHT SORT OF PLANS ARE INDEED ANY PLANS FOR A POST SADDAM IRAQ
WELL I THINK MY OWN PERSONAL EXAMPLE SHOWS THE LACK OF PLANNING FOR THE OFT
PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF JUST TURNED UP AS VOLUNTEERS THE MAJORITY WERE FROM AMERICA BUT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT FROM BRITAIN RESPONDED TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE'S REQUEST FOR VOLUNTEERS
AND WHEN I ARRIVED THERE WAS NO STRUCTURE FOR ME TO FIT IN TOO I HAD NO JOB DESCRIPTION NOBODY EVER TOLD ME HOW TO RUN A PROVINCE I WAS GIVEN NO DIRECTION AT ALL
AND OF COURSE FOR THE MILITARY THE POLICE FORCE WERE ALL DISBANDED THEY WILL HAVE THEIR WEAPONS WERE THEY DIGGING IN MANY CASES THEY SIMPLY TOOK THEIR WEAPONS HOPE WITH THEM THE WHOLE PLACE WAS IN CHAOS
AND THOSE DECISIONS TAKEN EARLY ON BY THE COALITION TO DISMISS THE CIVIL SERVANTS TO COLLAPSE WANT TO DISSOLVE THE SECURITY FORCES LED TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE STATE OF IRAQ THERE WAS ANARCHY
AND IT WASN'T ANARCHY WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED BUT IT STARTED TO GO THAT WAY BECAUSE THERE WAS A TOTAL POWER VACUUM
AND I DON'T THINK ANY COUNTRY COULD SURVIVE A FOREIGN INVADER DISMISSING ALL THEIR CIVIL SERVANTS AND DISSOLVING THEIR SECURITY FORCES IT LED TO CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ WHAT IS THE VERY LEAST THEN IN THAT CONTEXT YOU EXPECT CHILL GOT TO SAY TODAY
I HOPE IN THE CHILCOTT REPORT A MINUTE HIGHLIGHTS WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ SO THIS BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIMITATIONS OF EXTERNAL ACTORS IN FOREIGN LANDS
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IF POLICY IS SET IT MUST BE BASED ON RATIONAL AND REALISTIC EXP GOLDS AND ASSUMPTIONS
WE TEND TO JUST GO FROM POLICY DOWN TO TACTICS THAT ANY STRATEGY THERE HAS TO BE A NATIONAL STRATEGY BUT HOW DO YOU BRING ABOUT A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN THESE COUNTRIES IF WE ARE TO USE MILITARY FORCE IT'S NOT JUST THE KILL BAD GUYS
IT HAS TO BE TO TRY TO BRING ABOUT SOME POLITICAL SOLUTION TO MILITARY FORCES ARE MEANS NOT AS ENDS IN ITSELF WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THOUGH THAT AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS NOT ALL THE CHAOS AND THE BLOODSHED THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THAT REGION CAN BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF
MISSUS BLAIR AND BUSH
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THE DECISION TO GO TO IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WAS WRONG IT WAS BASED ON THE PRESUMPTION THAT IRAQ HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION BUT NOTHING THAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WAS INEVITABLE OR PRE ORDAINED IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER FUTURES FOR IRAQ AND IRAQI POLITICIANS IRAQI LEADERS THEMSELVES SHOULD TAKE A GREAT SHARE OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HAPPENED BUT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE LEARNED LESSONS FROM IT COS THAT AFTER ALL IS THE POND TO CHILCOTT
WELL I'M NOT CONVINCED AT THIS STAGE THAT WE HAVE LEARNED LESSONS
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE IRAQ OR SYRIA IT IS A CIVIL WAR THAT IS GOING ON AND AN EXTERNAL ACTOR IF YOU LIKE HAS TO TRY AND MEDIATE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT GROUPS TO CREATE A PEACE AGREEMENT THAT IS INCLUSIVE
# EMMA'S GUYS THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED FOR TALKING TO US AND I SHOULD TELL YOU OBVIOUSLY AS YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THEY WILL BE COVERAGE OF THE CHILL COOK REPORT THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON B.B.C. NEWS PROGRAMMES INCLUDING THE COURSE OF THE WORLD AT ONE THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST EIGHT ALMA DEUTSCHE WROTE HER FIRST OPERA AT THE AGE OF SEVEN SHE WROTE HER VIOLIN CONCERTO AT NINE THIS YEAR HER FULL LENGTH OPERA OF CINDERELLA WILL BE PREMIERED IN VIENNA
SHE'S JUST ELEVEN NO WONDER SHE'S BEEN COMPARED WITH MOZART BUT ARMOUR COMES FROM DORKING IN SURREY AND SHE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOW I KNOW THAT YOU STARTED PLAYING PIANO AND VIOLIN AT WHAT JUST THE AGE OF THREE WHEN I I STARTED PLAYING THE PIANO WHEN I WAS TWO
AND THE VIOLIN WHEN I WAS THREE AND ACTUALLY I STARTED TO COMPOSE WHEN I WAS FOUR SO WRITING THINGS DOWN ON PAPER YOU JUST FOUND THAT THE MUSIC WAS COMING TO YOU YES I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT HE WAS CALLED COMPOSING THEN I JUST SIT AT THE PIANO AND PLAY THEIR IDEAS I HAD IN MY HEAD
LET'S HEAR ONE OF THEM WHICH ACTUALLY YOU CAME UP WITH THIS WHEN YOU WERE NINE AND IT'S WHAT YOU'LL BE PLAYING AT THE HENLEY FESTIVAL TOMORROW IT'S THE THIRD MOVEMENT OF YOUR VIOLIN CONCERTO AND I THINK YOU'RE WHAT THIS IS YOU PLAYING THE VIOLIN IN IT WITH THE ISRAELI PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA YOU PLAYED WITH THEM IN TEL AVIV LAST IN LAST YEAR LET LET'S HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF IT
IT'S LOVELY TO AND SHE TO WATCH YOU LISTENING TO THAT HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU
WELL WHEN I WAS WHEN WHEN I WAS PLAYING WITH THE WITH THE ORCHESTRA IN THE BEGINNING
I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT SUSPICIOUS THEY LOOKED AS IF YOU KNOW WHO'S THIS LITTLE GIRL IN HER BUT THEN WHEN I TEND TO THEN AND THEY STA I PAID MAKE A DENT
BUT I THINK THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR MINDS IMMEDIATELY AND YET I PRAY THAT YOU WHEN YOU'RE COMPOSING I DON'T IF YOU STILL DO I MEAN YOU'VE GROWN UP A BIT SINCE NINE BUT YOU ARE COMPOSED WHEN YOU'RE SKIPPING YES I STILL DO
I HAVE A SKIPPING ROPE WHICH ACTUALLY I DON'T SKIP WITH IT I JUST WAVE IT AROUND AND THEY TELL STORIES IN MY HEAD AND THEN SOMETIMES A MELODY JUST POPS INTO MY HEAD AND SO THAT'S HOW I GET MY TUNES OR SOMETIMES WHEN I'M JUST WAKING UP I GET THEM ALL I'M JUST FALLING ASLEEP OR AT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT MAY AND ASLEEP
GETTING THE TUNES FOR ME ACTUALLY THAT'S THE EASY BIT BUT THEN THEN HAVING TO SIT DOWN AND DEVELOPING IT INTO PROPER PIECE SO AND COMBINING IT WITH OTHER MELODIES IN A COHERENT WAY POLISHING IT
THAT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT BIT FOR ME AND YOU HAVE CINDERELLA YOUR FIRST FULL LENGTH OPERA STAGE THERE WHICH WILL BE PREMIERED THIS YEAR EXACTLY COULD BE PREMIERED IN VIENNA WHICH IS EXTREMELY EXCITING BECAUSE THE N. IS THE CAPITAL OF MUSIC BUT I'M ALSO REALLY HOPING THAT IT WILL BE PERFORMED HERE IN ENGLAND
NOW I HAVE TO I MEANT I SHOULD CORRECT MYSELF BEFORE I FORGET I MADE HIM SINGS IN HENLEY FESTIVAL YOU'LL BE PERFORMING ON FRIDAY I THINK I SAID TOMORROW BUT OF COURSE YOU ARE BEING LIKENED TO MOZART HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT WELL AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IF I WAS
AGAIN JUST A LITTLE MOTOR I THINK IT'LL BE A BIG BORIC BECAUSE I WOULD JUST WRITE EXACTLY WHAT MODS I DID WRITTEN BEFORE I THINK THEY WOULD PREFER TO BE A LITTLE
BUT THEY ARE THAT BUT WHAT I CUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT YOU KNOW THESE IN I HOPE ABOUT SAY TUNES BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY I MEAN THE MUSIC JUST COMES TO YOU DOES IT
YES THE MUSIC JUST COMES TO ME AND THEN I HAVE TO THEN I HAVE TO DEVELOP IT SO I'M GOING TO GO AND PERFORM THE THIRD MOVEMENT OF MY VIOLIN CONCERTO IN THE HENLEY FESTIVAL
WHICH BRING TURTLE IS SINGING HIS ARIAS FROM THE OPERA THEN HE INVITED ME TO COME AND PLAY AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE FLOATING STAGE IN A RIVER SO MINUTE A BIT SCARED THAT THEY MIGHT FALL IN BUT THEN THERE'S A WHOLE ORCHESTRA US I EXPECT IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT
AND TO THE WAY THE PEOPLE REACT TO YOU I MEAN YOU MAKE THE POINT ABOUT WHEN YOU HOW THE ORCHESTRA WERE REACTING TO YOU THEY HAD SUSPICIONS AND THEN DO YOU GET A LITTLE BIT BORED THAT PEOPLE THINK ARE GOODNESS THEY JUST THINK I'M A WELL AND I THINK SOMETIMES
SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT OLD AND FAT AND I HAVEN'T GOT A BEER AND EMINEM OR DEAD THEN MAYBE I'M NOT SERIOUS COMPOSER BUT I THINK THAT ALL ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN
THERE'S CHILDREN WHO IF FOOT OUT FOR I WOULD LIKE THEM TO A CLASSICAL MUSIC I THINK IT WOULD BE IF THEY KNEW THAT I'M NOT DEAD AND FAT AND HAVE A BEER HEAD THEY WOULD
THEY WOULD START TO LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC A LITTLE BIT MORE MY MUSIC AND THEY WOULD FIND IT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY INTERESTING O.K. WELL WE'RE GOING TO HEAR YOU PLAY LIVE A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME BUT ON THE DEUTSCHE FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# HE HAS THE IMPOSSIBLE TASK OF FOLLOWING THAT I DO APOLOGISE I CAN'T COMPETE APART FROM THE FACT I STOPPED GROWING AT ELEVEN O.K. LITERALLY MY ONLY CONNECTION I'M AFRAID IT IS HISTORIC JOURNEY AT EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN CONTINUES TONIGHT AS THEY PLAY PORTUGAL FOR A PLACE IN THE FINAL OF THEIR FIRST MAJOR TOURNAMENT SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WORLD CUP GARETH BELLS ISRAEL MADRID TEAM MATE CRISTIANO RONALDO WAS SEEN AS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO EARTH IS PROGRESS BUT CAPTAIN ACTUALLY WILLIAM SAYS THEY'RE NOT FOCUSING ON WHEN I'LL DO TOO MUCH
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS IN THE WORLD BUT THEY DO UP OTHER WEAPONS AS WELL IN A TEAM SO WE WEREN'T WE'RE NOT OBSESSING OVER HIM WE DO OUR WORK AND WE PLAYED THEM THE RESPECT THAT THEY DESERVE
WHEN WE AND NULLIFY THEM AS A TEAM AS WE HAVE DONE OR TOURNAMENT KICK OFF IS AT EIGHT P.M. AND A WIN FOR WALES WOULD MAKE THEM THE FIRST BRITISH TEAM TO REACH A MAJOR TOURNAMENT FINAL SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY SIX NOW HISTORY MAY MAKE PORTUGAL THE BOOKIES' FAVOURITE BUT CAN'T FORM I SUGGEST OTHERWISE WALES WON FOUR OUT OF THEIR FIVE GAMES IN NORMAL TIME WHEREAS PORTUGAL HAD REACHED THE SEMI FINALS
FAILING TO WIN AT ALL IN NINETY MINUTES AT WIMBLEDON VENUS WILLIAMS HAS BECOME THE OLDEST GRAND SLAM SEMI FINALIST FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AT THE AGE OF THIRTY SIX AFTER BEATING KAZAKHSTAN'S HERE ARE SLOW VA CHEVETTE IN STRAIGHT SETS AND THE PROSPECT OF A WILLIAM SISTERS' FINAL REMAINS AS DEFENDING CHAMPION SERENA ALSO REACHED THE LAST FOUR IT'S MEN'S QUARTER FINAL DAY TODAY ANDY MURRAY WILL TAKE ON TWELFTH SEED JO WILFRIED TSONGA ON CENTRE COURT AND FORMER BRITISH NUMBER ONE
TIM HENMAN JOINS US FROM S. W. NINETEEN MORNING TIM GOOD MORNING WE THOUGHT THAT KERRY ELSE WOULD BE A TEST FOR ANDY MURRAY AND HE WASN'T MUCH OF ONE IN THE END WHAT ABOUT JOE WILLIE TSONGA
YEAH IT IS IT IS ANOTHER REAL POTENTIAL TEST TSONGA BEAT FEDERER OUT ON THIS COURT YEARS GO FROM TWO SETS TO LOVE DOWN HE'S HE'S GOT A BIG BIG GAME AND I THINK HE'S PLAYING VERY WELL AT THE MOMENT BUT YOU KNOW I LIKE THE WAY HE'S BEEN PLAYING HE WAS SO IMPRESSIVE AGAINST JUST DISMANTLED HIM IN THE FIRST SET AND KIRI OR SAID NOTHING LEFT AFTER THAT SO HE'S IN A VERY GOOD SPOT RIGHT NOW
YES AND ANDY MURRAY CERTAINLY BEEN VERY IMPRESSIVE HE'S YET TO DROP A SET AT THIS YEAR'S TOURNAMENT DO YOU THINK THAT'S DOWN TO A BOOST FROM REUNITING WITH COACH IVAN LENDL
WELL NO I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST AND HE'S THE ONE AS TO GO OUT ON THE COURT AND DELIVER THE GOODS AND HIT THE SHOT SO HE'S THE ONE THAT'S BEEN PLAYING VERY WELL FOR A LONG TIME YOU GO BACK SORT OF THE LAST PROBABLY TEN WEEKS ONTO THE CLAY COURT SEASON IN ROME AND MADRID WHERE HE WON AND WAS IN THE FINAL FINAL THE ROLE AND GARETH HE'S BEEN PLAYING GREAT TENNIS AND THAT'S EVEN THOUGH IT'S A DIFFERENT SURFACE A GREAT FOUNDATION COMING INTO TO WIMBLEDON SO HE'S BACK THAT UP WITH WINNING THE TITLE AGAIN AT QUEEN'S FOR THE FIFTH TIME
YEAH HE DOES HE DOES LOOK LIKE HE'S IN GREAT SHAPE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY AND I'M SHORT HAVE LENTIL BACK IN HIS CORNER WILL WILL HELP PSYCHOLOGICALLY TO DISCUSS DIFFERENT TACTICS AND DIFFERENT SCENARIOS IN THE LATTER STAGES OF SLAMS BECAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WHAT LEMON LENDL WAS INVOLVED IN A LOT DURING HIS CAREER SO NO THINGS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT'S FOR SURE AND FIRST UP ON CENTRE COURT TODAY IS ROGER FEDERER VERSUS MARIN CHILL ITCH HOW DO YOU THINK THAT
I WOULD MAKE FEDERER THE SLIGHT FAVOURITES JUST GIVEN HIS SORT A GRASS COURT RECORD AND HIS HISTORY HERE IN THIS TOURNAMENT BEEN A SEVEN TIMES CHAMPION BUT CHILL IT IS DANGEROUS WHEN THEY PLAYED AT THE U.S. OPEN IN THE SEMI FINALS CHILL IT BEAT FEDERER IN STRAIGHT SETS IN A FEDERAL APPRECIATE THE DANGERS AND IT'S ABOUT WHO CAN COME OUT AND DELIVER THE GOODS ON THE DAY AND THE PERSON THAT GET SOME CHANCES AND TAKE THOSE CHANCES WILL OBVIOUSLY COME OUT ON TOP
LET'S HAVE A QUICK WORD ON THE OTHER QUARTER FINALS TODAY QUERY VERSIS ROW NATURE AND BERDYCH UP AGAINST POOEY
YEAH AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S THE SORT OF HALF OF THE DRAW THAT JOCKEY WHICH IS VACATED SO ALL THOSE PLAYERS WILL BE LOOKING AT THE THE OPPORTUNITY AND AQUARIA OBVIOUSLY BEATING DJOKOVIC HAS GOT TOUGH MATCH AGAINST ROUND IT

THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE WEEKEND SUICIDE BOMBING IN BAGHDAD HAS RISEN TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THE ATTACK CARRIED OUT BY THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IS THE DEADLIEST IN THE IRAQI CAPITAL SINCE THE U.S. LED INVASION
# THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY SAYS SHE'S THE ONLY CANDIDATES WHO CAN UNITE BRITAIN AFTER HER RESOUNDING VICTORY IN THE FIRST ROUND OF VOTING IN THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST MISSUS MADE TOPPED THE POLL WITH THE SUPPORT OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE M.P.S ANDREA LENT SOME AND MICHAEL GOES OVER THE ONLY OTHERS STILL IN THE RUNNING
# THE POUND HAS FALLEN TO HER NEW THIRTY ONE YEAR LOW AGAINST THE DOLLAR DURING TRADING IN THE FAR EAST AMID HEIGHTENED FEARS ABOUT BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION AT ONE POINT STERLING DROPPED BELOW ONE DOLLAR TWENTY EIGHT BEFORE RECOVERING SLIGHTLY
# THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE IT WAS MEANT TO BE OVER AFTER SIX DAYS OF STRIKES BY JUNIOR DOCTORS SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR THEIR UNION THE B.M.A. STRUCK A DEAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT WON THEY RECOMMENDED THE DOCTORS EXCEPT BUT YESTERDAY THE DOCTOR SAID NO
FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT VOTED TO REJECT THE DEAL SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW WELL NO ONE REALLY KNOWS THE GOVERNMENT MAY IMPOSE THE DEAL THE DOCTORS MAKE UP BACK ON STRIKE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THE MAN WHO LED NEGOTIATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE JUNIOR DOCTORS JOHANN MULLER WANNA HAS RESIGNED HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
THEY MADE A MISTAKE IN VOTING TO REJECT THIS TODAY THE FACT IS THAT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME THOSE A CHRONIC UNDERSTAFFING AND UNDERFUNDING OF THE N.H.S. ON YOUR PROGRAMME TODAY WE'VE HEARD TWO STORIES ABOUT ABOUT JUST THE EFFECT OF FRONT LINE ON FRONT LINE STAFF AND
THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL BREAKDOWN IN TRUST BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND FRONT LINE STAFF AND ACTUALLY NO MATTER WHAT WE COULD TRY TO DO TO IT TO ALLEVIATE THE KIND OF THE CONCERNS OF DOCTORS THE FACT IS THAT MOST FRONTLINE STAFF SEE THE GOVERNMENT WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO ATTACK THEM AND UNDERMINED THEM IN THEIR JOBS AND THIS IS AN INDICTMENT OF THAT BUT DO YOU NOT ACCEPT PART OF THE BLAME FOR THAT THE WAY YOU HANDLED NEGOTIATIONS HAS LED TO THIS POINT
WELL I HAVE TO SAY THAT IF I WERE HAVING WATCHED THE GOVERNMENT UP CLOSE WOULDN'T REGARDS TO GO SHH OCEAN I'M SLIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING THE OTHER NEGOTIATIONS COMING UP THAT BUT THE FACT IS THAT WHAT THEY DO THEY'RE NEGOTIATING TACTIC SEEMS TO BE JUST ATTACKING PEOPLE UNDERMINING THEM THEY KNOW WE STARTED OFF THIS PROCESS IN JULY LAST YEAR WITH THE WITH THE GOVERNMENT COMING OUT IN QUITE
BRUTAL WAY AGAINST AGAINST YOUNG DOCTORS NOW THE QUESTION IS IS THAT THE RIGHT TACTICS TO TAKE WITH A FRONT LINE GROUP OF STAFF I WOULD QUESTION WHETHER ACTUALLY THAT IS A GOOD OPENING POSITION YOU ARE BEING DISINGENUOUS HERE AREN'T YOU IN THAT IN MAY THE HEALTH SERVICE JOURNAL PUBLISHED A SERIES OF WHAT'S THAT MESSAGES FROM YOUR TEAM THE B.M.A. JUNIOR'S DOCTOR'S TEAM NOT LEAST IN WHICH YOU SAID IN ONE OF THE MESSAGES
THAT THE BEST SOLUTION MIGHT INCLUDE PLAYING OUT THE DISPUTE FOR SO LONG THAT IT WOULD FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE THEIR CONTACT CONTRACT AGAINST OUR SUPPORT THE FACT IS THAT YOUNG DOCTORS WERE INVOLVED IN THE CRUCIBLE OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISPUTES OF OF THE GENERATION OF A GENERATION AND I ACCEPT THAT THOSE THOSE MESSAGES WERE
WERE DIFFICULT BUT YOU CAN THOSE MESSAGES YOU WROTE THAT I ACCEPT THAT BUT YOU THINK HANDED TO SPIN IT OUT THE FACT IS THAT WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER IN ONE OF THE MOST STRESSFUL TIMES IN OUR PROFESSION YOU SAW YESTERDAY ABOUT HUNTLEY SO WHY WERE YOU SPINNING IT OUT BUT THAT'S I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE THE FACT IS THAT UNDER MY UNDERLYING ALL OF THIS IS THE FACT THAT JUNIOR DOCTORS FELT INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY ANGRY INCREDIBLY UPSET WITH HOW THEY WERE BEING TREATED
AND THE FACT IS THAT JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE THE FRONT LINE STAFF TO KEEP THE N.H.S. GOING LIKE THE NURSES LIKE THE MIDWIVES THE VERY STAFF THAT KEEP THE N.H.S. GOING IN THAT ANGER THAT WAS CAUSED BY THE GOVERNMENT ATTACKING THEM UNDERMINING THEM ABSOLUTELY BEING SO
VINDICTIVE INNIT IT'S NATURE AGAINST THEM IS WHAT MAKES TOXINS ABSOLUTELY REJECT THESE KIND OF THE DEAL THAT WAS IN FRONT OF IT SPENT ON SPENT BOAT LET ME QUOTE ANOTHER OF THESE WHAT'S THAT GROUPS BECAUSE GRID TO TRY TO BUT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU WERE COMING FROM GIVEN WHAT YOU SAY NOW BECAUSE IT IS ALSO IN THIS GROUP SAYS THE COMMITTEE WANTED TO DRAW THIS DISPUTE RIGHT OUT WITH PUNCTUATED INDUSTRIAL ACTION FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD
AND TIE THE DEPARTMENT FELT UP IN KNOTS FOR THE NEXT SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN MONTH THE FACT IS THAT DOCTORS I WENT ROUND THIS COUNTRY FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS TALKING TO DOCTORS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND THE LEVEL OF ANGER THAT FRONT LINE STAFF HAVE IS INCREDIBLE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF TRUST WITH GOVERNMENT THE FACT IS THAT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT CAME OUT AND DECIDED THAT THE WAY TO APPROACH CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WAS TO BELITTLE AND ATTACK FRONT LINE STUFF THAT WAS A HUGELY DAMAGING WAY TO APPROACH THIS
SO THE ANGER THAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF HOPE WITH WITH THE N.H.S. STAFF
IS IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT HOW THIS GOVERNMENT TREATS N. H. THE N.H.S. GENERALLY AND HOW THE GOVERNMENT TREATS HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE THEY'RE WANTING FOR THAT IT EVENTUALLY BECAME POLITICAL THEY WANTED TO BRING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT OVER THIS THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT DOCTORS ARE NOT BROUGHT TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT I HAVE TO SAY THE A BIT KIND OF ACCUSATIONS THAT THEY THAT SOMEHOW THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WOULD WANT TO DO THAT IS IS FRANKLY APPALLING BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT WE'RE TALKING A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE
INCREDIBLY NOT POLITICISED THIS THIS HAS BEEN A SOMEWHAT OF A POLITICAL AWAKENING FOR MOST OF THESE YOUNG DOCTORS BUT THE WHY DID SPRING AWAKENING WE WHAT YOU HAVE TO ASK IS WHY DOES NINETY EIGHT PER CENT OF A PROFESSION THAT IS SO PLACID NORMALLY VOTE FOR INDUSTRIAL ACTION WHY IS THAT SCUM ON A REGULAR REGULAR IN REGULARLY THROUGH THIS DISPUTE SO INDUSTRIAL RING AWAKENING TO END AUSTERITY HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT
THE COMMENTS THAT CAME OUT FROM SOME OF THAT AT VARIOUS POINTS DURING I MEAN I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE SAID BUT THE POINT IS THAT ACTUALLY WHAT WE SEE WITH YOUNG DOCTORS IF THEY SEE THE N.H.S. CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED CHRONICALLY UNDERSTAFFED YOU SAW YOU HEARD TODAY O.K. TO PUT TO HER STORIES ABOUT WHY HOW FRONT LINE STAFF HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERSTAFFING IN THE SAFETY ASPECTS IN THE N.H.S.
NOW THESE ARE YOUNG DOCTORS THAT DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO THE N.H.S. AND WHEN THEY SEE THAT ON A DAY IN DAY OUT BASIS AND THEN THEY HAVE THE GOVERNMENT COME OUT AND ATTACK THEM AND MAKE OUT THAT THEY'RE THE PROBLEM THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A REAL PROBLEM SHOULD HAPPEN NOW THIS IS A DEAL THAT YOU RECOMMENDED SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSE IT OR WERE YOU MISTAKEN AND RECOMMENDING IT AND THEY SHOULD BE FURTHER STRONG I HAVE TO SAY THAT I THINK THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT FACES THIS GOVERNMENT AND THIS COUNTRY IS THAT THEY NEED TO BUILD TRUST WITH THEIR FRONT LINE STAFF OF THE N.H.S.
WHATEVER THE DEAL ON THE TABLE IS THE FACT IS THAT VOTE SHOWS THAT DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS TO GET ROUND THE COUNTRY AND EXPLAIN IT THAT THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL BREAKDOWN IN TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO REBUILD THAT AND THAT MEANS TAKING A STEP BACK LOOKING AT THE WAY IT DEALS WITH THAT WITH FRONT LINE STAFF AND GENUINELY APPROACH THIS IN A MUCH MORE CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER I WANNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
# SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO KNOW THEY SAID THERESA MAY WOULD WALK IT AND SHE DID MORE VOTES IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE CONTEST AND ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES PUT TOGETHER SO IT SEEMS PRETTY SAFE TO PREDICT THAT THERE WILL BE ONE OF THE TWO NAMES ON THE BALLOT WHEN CONSERVATIVE PARTY MEMBERS VOTE TO CHOOSE THE NEXT LEADER THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER AND A COUPLE OF MONTHS BUT WINNING THE SUPPORT OF M.P.S IS NOT THE SAME AS WINNING THE SUPPORT OF THE MASS MEMBERSHIP ONE OF MISSUS M.

SHOT WHEN I GO BACK YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU FOR THAT ONE RIGHT BUT BUT LOOK
THE FACT THAT SHE HAS THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT AMONG M.P.S DOES NOT MEAN SHE'LL HAVE THE SAME SORT OF KIND OF SUPPORT AMONG THE MASS MEMBERSHIP DOES IT WE'VE SEEN THAT THEY CAN BE SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT M. PEAS AND WHAT MEMBERS OF THE LABOUR PARTY
AND SHE WOULD PREFER NOT TO LOOK AT WELL BUT THINK SHE WOULD SHE WOULD PREFER TO FACE MICHAEL GO THAN TO PREFER THEM THAN TO FACE LETTERMAN I HONESTLY THINK IT WILL BE BRILLIANT FOR THE MEMBERSHIP SO I HAVE A CHOICE OF ANY ONE OF THE THREE NOW CLEARLY TREATS HER HE'S GOING TO GO WHEREVER AND AND AND I'VE COURSE SO WHILST THE QUESTION SO IT'S HELPING WHEN I OFTEN EXPLAIN YOURSELF ONLY MIND

WANT HER TO BE PRIME MINISTER WANTED OFFICER THIS THIS BLOODY DIFFICULT WOMAN AND I'M QUOTING KEN CLARKE OF COURSE THE BLOODY DIFFICULT WOMAN WITH NOT MUCH FOREIGN EXPERIENCE THAT'S THE ONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CANEZE HIS CANE EITHER I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR MANY MANY YEARS HE FORGET TO SAY THAT WE'VE BOTH WORKED AND HE WAS TALKING TO MALCOLM RIFKIND I DO BELIEVE AT THE TIME AND HE WENT ON TO SAY WHICH YOU YOU'VE LEFT OUT OF THE QUOTE WE HAD THAT WAS LIKE IT WE BOTH
WE BOTH WORK WITH MARGARET THATCHER AND ANYBODY MY WORK AM I RIGHT YOU WERE ALSO TELL YOU SHE WAS A VERY DIFFICULT ONE BUT PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST PRIME MINISTERS WITH HE HE DID SAY THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE BUT THERE IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM FOR HER ISN'T THERE IN THAT SHE VOTED THREE SHE SUPPORTED THE REMAIN CAMP THE COUNTRY VOTED TO LEAVE THE YOUNG THAT THAT IS A PROBLEM ISN'T IT WHAT IF IT WAS I WOULDN'T BE SINGING WITH OUR CAMP PEOPLE LIKE LIAM

# STIRLING LEEDS U.K. ASSETS DOWN AS BRECK'S IT FALL OUT FEARS GRIPPED MARKETS THAT'S THE HEADLINE IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIS MORNING INVESTORS HAVE STOP FROM CASHING IN ON THREE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FUNDS CREDIT RATING AGENCIES HAVE DOWNGRADED THE U.K. IN THE POUND IS AT A THIRTY YEAR LOW AGAINST THE DOLLAR HOW MUCH DOOM AND GLOOM ARE WE FACING AS A RESULT OF THE VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WERE RUPERT HARRISON IS CURRENTLY CHIEF MET MACRO STRATEGIST FOR MULTI
ASSETS ARE BLACKROCK ROCKER HE WAS THEIR CHIEF OF STAFF TO GEORGE OSBORNE AND CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL ECONOMIC ADVISORS UNTIL TWENTY FIFTEEN HE'S HERE AND WE JOINED ALSO ON THE LINE BY PIPPA MOM BURN WHO'S AN AMERICAN POLICY ANALYST AND USED TO BE A WHITE HOUSE ECONOMICS ADVISER GOOD MORNING BOTH GOOD MORNING RIBBON HAS SOME THINGS ARE GRIM YOU WOULD SAY
WELL IT'S EARLY DAYS BUT I'M AFRAID IT SO FAR THINGS ARE PANNING OUT BROADLY AS THE BANK OF ENGLAND IN THE TREASURY AND MANY OTHERS WARNED BUT ALL WE HAVE SO FAR AS REALLY FINANCIAL MARKETS TRYING TO FIND THEIR WAY FLYING BLIND WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY DATA BUT WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IN THE U.K. ECONOMY FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE TRYING TO FORM THEIR VIEW OF WHAT THE RIGHT VALUE FOR STERLING IS WHERE THE STOCK MARKET SHOULD BE BUT IT WON'T REALLY BE FOR ANOTHER MONTH AT LEAST UNTIL WE GET SOME REAL DATA ON WHAT BUSINESSES ARE DOING WHICH IS REALLY WHAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE I SUPPOSE WOULD SUSPECT THAT THIS IS ON PAPER JUST WAIT THESE PRICES COULD GO UP AGAIN YES OF COURSE I MEAN THAT'S THE JOB OF FINANCIAL MARKETS TO TRY AND ANTICIPATE WHAT THEY THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT I THINK THAT FAR WAS THE AMAZING THING IS THAT MARKETS AROUND THE ENTIRE WORLD REALLY ARE STILL BEING DRIVEN BY THIS EVENT AND WE'VE SEEN IT SO THAT THE MARKET THE BIGGEST MARK IN THE WORLD FOR YOU U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT WAS SET REALLY THE FLOOR ON INTEREST RATES FOR THE WHOLE WORLD
AS THOSE INTEREST RATES HAVE FALLEN TO NEAR RECORD LOWS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS PROBABLY A BIT OF AN OVERREACTION BECAUSE BRICKS IT WAS I THINK A BIG DEAL FOR THE U.K. AND PROBABLY AN ISSUE FOR EUROPE BUT I DON'T SEE HOW IT AFFECTS THE WHOLE WORLD TO THE EXTENT THE MARKET'S A FACTORING IN AT THE MOMENT I'D PEPPER MARGARET I THINK YOU WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S ONLY SHORT TERM FOR THE U.K.
YES I WOULD AND I WOULD AGREE WITH WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT ED BRITISH TAKE BREAGHA TERRIBLY SERIOUSLY BUT THE REST THERE WERE ACTUALLY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT BRIBES AND EARS AND THE BUCKETS ARE DOWN IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE REALISATION THAT THE ITALIAN BANKS ARE IN NEED OF A MAST BAIL OUT
AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE ABUSE ON CHINA MAYBE IN A WEAKER POSITION THAN EVERYBODY HAD PARTS SO YOU KNOW GLOBAL MARKETS ARE JUST INTO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS NOT JUST THE SAVANNAH I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT
NOW THERE'S HUGE ANTICIPATION OF FATHER EXITS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE GROWTH OF THE ENTIRE E.U. SENTIMENT ON THE CONTINENT IS REALLY POWERFUL
SO THE POSSIBILITY OF EXITS FROM E.U. MEMBERS BEYOND BRETON HAS TO BE FACTORED IN BY THE MARKETS AS WELL
AND THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S ABOVE THE VERY DOWNWARD TREND ON THE MARKET TODAY ARE TRYING TO MOST BANANA CERTAINLY BAD FOR THE BRITISH AND I HAVE TO SAY A LOT OF INVESTORS LOOKING AROUND THE WORLD SAYING WELL IF I HAVE TO CHEERS
GIVEN CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND GIVEN THE DRUG DOES ON AS JUST ANOTHER CHANCE CUT ACTUALLY THE U.K. MAY TURN OUT TO BE A SAFER PLACE TO KEEP MY CAPITAL THAN INCITING EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S UNRAVELLING
RIBA HARRISON IF YOU WERE STILL AND PERHAPS YOU ARE STILL OCCASIONALLY GIVING THE OCCASIONAL BIT OF ADVICE TO GEORGE OSBORNE WHAT WOULD YOU ARE YOU NO NOT REALLY NO O.K. BUT IF YOU WERE IF YOU HAD HIS EAR AGAIN WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD BE DOING NOW TO STEADY THE SHIP WELL THE TRUTH IS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT CAN BE DONE STUDY STRIPPERS NOT REALLY IN HIS CONTROL AND THAT IS TO GIVE A
CLEAR ROAD MAP OF WHAT THAN THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER WAS GOING TO DO ABOUT A NEGOTIATION WITH THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIP'S GOING TO BE BECAUSE I DISAGREE I THINK THE IMPACT IS LARGELY A U.K. IMPACT AND THE IMPACT IS REALLY ABOUT UNCERTAINTY AND WE'VE SEEN SOME EARLY INDICATIONS OF LOWER ADVERTS FOR JOBS AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS BEING DELAYED AND IT'S THIS COLOUR CHRONIC UNCERTAINTY FACING IN A U.K. BUSINESS NOW ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE TRADING RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO BE WITH EUROPE AND ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY
WHOEVER IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE TRY AND NARROW DOWN SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY THAT ITS BUSINESSES FACE ABOUT ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET IN PARTICULAR THAT'S REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND YOU WOULD ARGUE THAT IN THEY GO THAT'S THE CRITICAL THING TO GET AS MUCH ACCESS AS POSSIBLE I WOULD FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW AS MUCH ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET IS POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S GOING TO MINIMISE THEIR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION EGGHEADS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU SEE AS A RESULT OF THIS HOW DO YOU THINK THAT A POLITICIAN SHOULD BE CAPITALISING ON IT WHAT SHOULD THEY BE DOING
WELL FIRST OF ALL I MUST TALK ABOUT THE TRADE FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW IS BRITISH TRADE REVERTED TO THE W.T.O. BUT LET'S LIGHT GOVERNS THE TRADE WITH UNITED STATES OR NOBODY COMPLAINS ABOUT A DISASTER SO AND THE SUPERMARKET IT'S NOT EVEN A COMPLETED FROM ROMANY SO YES O.K. THERE ARE SOME UNCERTAINTIES BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF BREAKDOWN OF THE TRADE RELATIONSHIP COS UNDER THERE
WHETHER COMPOST BY THE NATION ROLLS THE EUROPEANS KEVIN MCALEER BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M LINERS WERE BRITISH POLITICIANS HAVE TO DO THEY HAVE TO BOTH REUNITE THE KINGDOM AND FORGED A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNION THIS IS A HIGH PASS IN NEXT WHY IMPORTANT ALTERATIONS MAY HAVE SHOES AND WORSENED LEADER WHICH IT LOOKS LIKE SHE WELL COOL SHE HAS IN HER CABINET NEGOTIATING THESE THINGS ON HER BEHALF O.K. TRICKY TASKS

IT'S WHAT EVERY P.E. TEACHERS AS I THINK YOU STRAIGHT YOU MAINTAINED YOUR STRENGTH AND DEVELOP YOUR WEAKNESSES YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE GARETH'S OBVIOUSLY WAS A FANTASTIC FOOTBALLER WITH HIS LEFT FOOT THEN YOU JUST TRY TO ENCOURAGE THE FACT THAT YOU COULD USE IS RIGHT AS WELL I SEE IT WASN'T IT WAS THE OTHER KIDS A CHANCE WAS IT WAS A BIT OF THAT AS WELL AS WELL HE'S A NICE BLOKE I KNEW HIM AS A YOUNGSTER WELL THERE MY BROTHER KNEW WELL THAT
