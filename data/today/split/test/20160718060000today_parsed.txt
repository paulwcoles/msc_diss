SHE WANTED TO BE A RECKLESS GAMBLE TO ABANDON THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON HAS WRITTEN AN ARTICLE IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WILL BE SPEAKING TO HIM AT TEN PAST EIGHT THIS MORNING ABOUT THIS HE SAYS THAT A VOTE TO RENEW TRIDENT WILL SHOW THAT DESPITE THE BRECHT'S REFERENDUM DECISION ARE CERTAINLY NOT TURNING OUR BACK ON THE SECURITY
OF EUROPE AND THE REST OF THE WORLD THE TELEGRAPH POINTS OUT THAT THE VOTE COULD SEE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED LABOUR M.P.S DEFYING THEIR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN BY SUPPORTING TRIDENT
# REMARKABLE STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MIRROR IT'S ABOUT A WOMAN CALLED DEBBIE STILL NO WHOSE LITTLE GIRL WAS KILLED IN A CAR CRASH WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN AND THE MISSUS STERN AND MADE THE DECISION THIS TERM HER HEART SHOULD BE OFFERED FOR A TRANSPLANT AND SHE HAS MET THE LITTLE GIRL WHO RECEIVED AT THE HARD AND WHO IS NOW FIT AND WELL AND MISSUS STONER
WENT TO MEET HER SHE LISTENED TO HER HEART AND SHE DESCRIBES IT LIKE THIS IT'S REALLY HARD TO EXPLAIN MY FEELINGS I KNEW HER HEART WAS NO LONGER JADE'S BECAUSE SHE'S NO LONGER HERE BUT IT WAS A PART OF HER IT GAVE ME GOOSE BUMPS I WAS CRYING BUT THEY WEREN'T TEARS OF SADNESS ALTHOUGH I LOST THE MOST PRECIOUS THING IN MY LIFE SHE IS CONTINUING TO LIVE ON IN A WAY IT IS A REALLY DEEPLY MOVING STORY
# THE TIME IS NOW TEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND OF COURSE THE OTHER BIG STORY IN THE PAPERS IS THE SHOOTING IN BATON ROUGE LOUISIANA THREE POLICE OFFICERS SHOT DEAD BY A LONE BLACK GUNMEN NICK BRYANT IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN BATON ROUGE ASKED HIM IF AMERICA HAD BEEN HALF EXPECTING ANOTHER SHOOTING LIKE THIS
THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN THE FEAR I MEAN THERE'S BEEN THIS RACIAL TENSION THAT HAS BEEN AT BOILING POINT REALLY FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS THERE WAS THAT POLICE SHOOTING OF A BLACK MAN IN BATON ROUGE THAT WAS FOLLOWED UP JUST DAYS LATER BY POLICE SHOOTING OF ANOTHER BLACK MAN IN MINNESOTA THEN WE HAD THAT RETALIATORY ATTACK HIM DALLAS WHERE FIVE POLICE OFFICERS WERE KILLED SO THERE WAS THIS FEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER INCIDENT HAPPENED THIS MORNING IT FORTY LOCAL TIME
THE POLICE WERE CALLED AFTER A BLACK MAN WAS SIGHTED IN BLACK CLOTHING WITH A RIFLE ON A HIGHWAY JUST YARDS REALLY FROM THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS HERE IN BATON ROUGE PEEP BASICALLY AMBUSH THE OFFICES THAT ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND HE KILLED THREE OF THEM
AND THAT LONE GUNMAN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED NOW IS A MAN CALLED GAVIN EUGENE LONG HE'S A TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD AFRICAN AMERICAN FOR MISSOURI HE'S A FORMER MARINE WHO SERVED A SIX MONTH TOUR OF DUTY IN IRAQ HE ALSO HAD AN ONLINE ALIAS COSMO POST A VIDEO MESSAGES ON THE INTERNET COMPLAINING ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AT THE HANDS OF POLICE CALLING FOR BLACK MEN TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR RACE WHAT'S THE MOOD
IN THE UNITED STATES I KNOW IT'S TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS IT UP TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT ARE PEOPLE SAYING JUST WE'VE GOT TO STOP IT OR ARE THEY SAYING WE ARE
IN SOME WAY AT FAULT HERE THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS FOR CALM FROM A NUMBER OF COURSES TONIGHT ONE OBVIOUSLY CAME FROM THE BULLY PULPIT OF THE WHITE HOUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE EVE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CONVENTION SAYING THIS WASN'T A TIME FOR INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC DONALD'S HAVEN'T RESPONDED TO THAT JUST MINUTES LATER ON TWITTER HE SAID THAT MY OBAMA DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE A COUNTRY'S DIVIDED IS A DIVIDED CRIME SCENE AS HE PUT IT AND IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE WE'VE ALSO HAD LEADERS OF THE BLACK LIVES MATTER
CAMPAIGN CALLING FOR FOR FOR CALM AND BECAUSE THEY'RE CLEARLY WORK WHERE WHERE THIS COULD LEAD I MEAN IT IS VERY TENSE AT THE MOMENT AND THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING FOR CARMEN I HAVE TO SAY I WATCHED HIS TELEVISED ADDRESS IN A CROWDED DEPARTURE LOUNGE ON THE WAY TO BATON ROUGE DOZENS OF PEOPLE WERE SAT AROUND JUST ONE OF THEM
ACTUALLY LOOKED UP AT THE SCREEN AND LISTEN TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING AND I THINK HE SPOKE EARLIER THIS WE SPOKE LAST WEEK IN DALLAS ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF HIS WORDS WELL TODAY PEOPLE WEREN'T EVEN LISTENING NICK
# THE TIME IS NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE NOW BEEN ARRESTED IN TURKEY WITH THE PRESIDENT VOWING TO PURGE STATE INSTITUTIONS OF THE VIRUS THAT LED TO THE COUP MARK LOWE AND HE'S IN ISTANBUL AND MARK OUT NOT SURPRISINGLY THAT SO MANY OF THESE WERE FROM THE MILITARY BUT ALMOST THREE THOUSAND A FROM THE JUDICIARY WHAT'S THE THINKING THERE
THE FEELING IS SARAH WITH THE GOVERNOR BELIEVES THAT THESE ARE FOLLOWERS OF THE EXILED ISLAMIC PREACHER WHO LEN WHO THE GOVERNMENT BLAMES FOR FERMENTING THIS ATTEMPTED COUP HE IS A MAN WHO WAS ONCE A CLOSE ALLY OF PRESIDENT HAD ONE HELPED HIM TO COME TO POWER AND THEN WENT AND LIVED IN THE U.S. WAS ACCUSED BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BY THE GOVERNMENT OF LEAKING MASSIVE PHONE CALLS TO WHICH SEEM TO IMPLICATE THE GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION MISSED OUT ON CALLS THAT AN ATTEMPTED COUP IN THEN
OF COURSE BLAMED FOR THIS ATTEMPTED COUP AS WELL MY DENIES EVERYTHING BUT THIS IS CLEARLY AN ATTEMPTED PURGE NOW OF THE DISSENTERS OF THE OPPONENTS IT'S AN ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE ARCH LOYALISTS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE AND OF THE INSTITUTIONS SO WHAT MY ADD ONE SEEMS TO HAVE DONE IS TURNED AN OPPORTUNE TURNED AN ATTEMPTED COUP REALLY INTO AN OPPORTUNITY HE'S GONE FROM ALMOST LOSING CONTROL LAST FRIDAY NIGHT
TO SUDDENLY FEELING CONFIDENT HE CAN TIGHTEN IT BUT THERE HAS BEEN A WARNING YESTERDAY THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS SAID MY ONE'S NOT USE THIS AS A BLANK CHEQUE TO SUDDENLY CLAMPED DOWN EVEN MORE ON DESCENT I THINK THAT WILL CLEARLY BE US CAST BY E.U. FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING TODAY IN BRUSSELS AT WHICH BORIS JOHNSON WILL MAKE HIS FIRST APPEARANCE WHAT DIFFERENCE IS IT LIKELY TO MAKE IN TURKEY I MEAN IT'S LONG BEEN KNOWN THAT HE HAD WANTED MORE POWER THIS GIVES HIM THAT OPPORTUNITY
IT DOES BUT IT WILL IN TRENCHES POWER EVEN MORE IT WILL TIGHTEN HIS CONTROL AND REALLY MY ADD ONE IS IS THE THE GREAT POLITICAL SURVIVOR HE IS THE BULLY BOY OF TURKISH POLITICS WHO WILL EMERGE FROM THIS STRONGER HE WILL TIGHTEN HIS CONTROL HE WILL MAKE SURE THAT ANYBODY IT'S DEEMED TO BE THOUGHT TO BE A FOLLOWER OF MY GLEN WILL BE
WILL BE ROUNDED UP AND THAT IS VERY WORRYING FOR HIS CRITICS THERE HAVE BEEN BIG PRO GOVERNMENT RALLIES EVERY NIGHT I WAS HEARING FROM TAX AND SQUARE LAST NIGHT THE PRO AIRED ONCE SONGS BLARING OUT FOR MANY HOURS HUGE PRODUCTS OF FLAG WAVING EXERCISES
SO CLEARLY MISSED OUT ONE WILL EMERGE IN THE STRONGER IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM THE BIG QUESTION I THINK SARAH IS HOW ON EARTH THIS HUGE ATTEMPTED COUP COULD HAVE EVEN HAPPENED IT MUST HAVE BEEN WEEKS IN THE PLANNING AND FOR A MAJOR GROUP WITHIN THE MILITARY TO PERHAPS PUT THESE PLANS INTO PROCESS TO TRY TO LAUNCH HELICOPTERS TO ARE REPORTS EVEN THAT TWO F. SIXTEEN FIGHTER JETS
MY ONE'S PLAIN COMING UP TO ISTANBUL AND COULD EVEN OPENED FIRE ON HIM THIS KIND OF PLANNING LOGISTICAL OPERATION TAKES WEEKS EITHER IT WENT ON UNDER THE NOSES OF THE AUTHORITIES OR THERE WAS SOME KIND OF COLLUSION CLEARLY SHOWS A MASSIVE INTELLIGENCE FAILURE AND INDEED DEEP RIVALRIES AND HOSTILITIES WITHIN TURKEY'S HIGHEST STATE INSTITUTIONS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT MISTER ADAM OR TRIED TO ROOT OUT MARLON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# THAT EITHER SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX ONE OF BRITAIN'S TOP TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IS FACING A BID FROM A JAPANESE RIVAL ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER THERESA MAY PROMISE TO STOP PREDATORY TAKEOVERS DOMINIC I DIDN'T THINK THAT THERE WERE PREDATORY TAKE OVER YOU WERE SAYING THAT THEY DON'T DO THAT NOT NOT PREDATOR IN THE SENSE OF CONTESTANTS AND IT'S A LONG LONG GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN YOU HAD THESE REALLY BIG TAKEOVER BATTLES THINGS TEND TO BE AGREED WAS THAT THEY JUST DON'T HAPPEN
TODAY'S NEWS IS GOING TO BE IN CAMP BREAKING ABOUT AN HOUR'S TIME WE EXPECT TO HEAR THE DETAILS OF THE JAPANESE BUT FOR ARMOUR HOLDINGS ARE CAMBRIDGE COMPANY THE DESIGNS COMPUTER CHIPS THE BIDDER IS SOFT BANK JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY CONGLOMERATE IT'LL OFFER TO PAY ABOUT TWENTY FOUR BILLION POUNDS TO BUY WHICH NOT EVERYONE WILL HAVE HEARD OF
IT IS WITHOUT DOUBT THOUGH BRITAIN'S PREMIER COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IT DOESN'T MAKE THE CHIPS BUT IT DESIGNS FOR A BEWILDERING RANGE OF MOBILE DEVICES ODDS I YOU'VE GOT ONE IN YOUR HOME AND YOUR EYE PHONING YOUR TABLET MAYBE EVEN IN YOUR WASHING MACHINE
THERE ARE BOUND TO BE CALLS FOR THE DEAL TO BE BLOCKED ANOTHER FARM BIT OR TAKING OUT A BRITISH STAR ALL THAT KIND OF THING AND THERESA MAY THE NEW PRIME MINISTER IN A SPEECH JUST BEFORE SHE WAS MADE THE NEW CONSERVATIVE LEADER PROMISED A PROPER INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY THAT WOULD STOP PREDATORY TAKE IT WELL WITH ME TO DISCUSS THE DEAL AS INDEPENDENT MARKETS ANALYST FROM BECOMING GOOD MORNING BRENDA MORNING TOMMY IS SOFT BANK THIS JAPANESE COMPANY WHICH IS KNOCKING ON THE DOOR OF ARM
A SOFT BUNKER'S BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE AND WRITE A RELIEF BEGAN AROUND THIRTY YEARS AGO AS A SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION COMPANY BUT SINCE THEN IT HAS REALLY GONE ON IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS AND NOW HE'S CERTAINLY A TELECOMMUNICATIONS GLAMOUR IT INVESTS IN ONLINE START UPS FROM INDIA TO CHINA AND IT OWNS A MOBILE CARRY US BOTH IN THE U.S. AND IN JAPAN TO THE GUY WHO RUNS SOFT BANK IS IT IS A VERY INTERESTING QUIRKY JAPANESE EXECUTIVE CALLED MASH IS ON AND HE KNOWS A DEAL WHEN HE SEES IT DOESN'T HE BOUGHT A STAKE AND ALI BARBER
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS THE GIANT CHINESE INTERNET AND IT'S NOW WITH SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SO HE KNOWS A GOOD THINGS BUT WHY ARE THEY AFTER IS THE SECRET SAUCE THAT WILL CERTAINLY IT IS HAS BEEN RAISING CASH OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS HE'S TRIED TO CAN HAVE PAID AND A DEBT AND BOTH TO ITS WAR CHEST BUT I THINK ALL THESE BIG DEALS ARE ALL PART OF THAT YOU'RE NOT A BIG A BIG SCENARIO IT HAS A BIG MOBILE TECHNOLOGY GOING ON IN THE U.S. AND JAPAN AND I SUPPOSE GETTING THE CHIPS THE DESIGNER
AS WELL REALLY KIND OF PUSHES IT ALL TOGETHER AND MAKES IT LOOK VERY SORT A SYNERGISTIC AND REMIND US JUST WHAT HARM DOES IT'S NOT EXACTLY A HOUSEHOLD NAME AS A NO I SUPPOSE IT REALLY SINCE BUT IT IS A MASSIVE CHIP DESIGNER AND IT WOULD YOU NO LICENCE A LOT OF THIS CHIPS TO THE LIKES OF SAMSUNG AN APPLE AS WELL SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED THE CHIPS AS WELL BUT WHAT IT DOES IS HAVE A VERY HIGH PROFIT MARGINS BECAUSE OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSOCIATED WITH DESIGNING THESE CHIPS
SO IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BE OTHER TAKEOVER BIDS FOR ARM ON THE BACK OF THIS A CERTAIN YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE A LITTLE BIT HEAD PLAY AROUND THERE SO I CAN'T IMAGINE THE INTEL OR ONE OF THE BIG SILICON VALLEY FIRMS WILL SETTLE IT'S HIM SUSPECT WALKS OFF THE THUMB THERE MUST BE A CANDLE JUST IN TERMS OF THE PRICE ARE PLAYING IS A BIG GLOBAL COMPANY BUT IT IS QUITE SMALL IN TERMS OF THE TURNINGS IN TERMS OF PUTTING ONE HUNDRED IT MAKES ABOUT A PROFIT OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A YEAR
MY BACK AT THE BACK OF THE FAG PACKET CALCULATION THAT MEANS SOFT BANK IS PAYING EIGHTY TIMES EARNINGS WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY UNHEARD OF MULTIPLE FOR TAKEOVER EVEN AND TECHNOLOGY IT IS PRETTY INTENSE BUT THIS IS REALLY THE TIMES WE LIVE IN AT THE MOMENT FOR FACADE BANKER GOING TO PAY SEVENTEEN POUNDS IN CASH FOR EACH SHARE IN ARM AND THAT'S A FORTY THREE PERCENT PREMIUM TO THE CLOSING PRICE LAST WEEK
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ARM SHARE PRICE OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO IT HASN'T REALLY GONE VERY FAR AND IT DOES TEND TO TRACK WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH UPPER SHARE PRICE WHICH HAS BEEN ULTIMATELY A LITTLE BIT DEPRESSED RECENTLY RELATIVE TO THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE'S BOUND TO BE SOME HOO HA ABOUT THE SPLIT TERESA MAY DID MAKE THE SPEECH DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE ANY LEVERS AND ITS DISPOSAL ANY BUTTONS IT CAN PUSH IMMEDIATELY TO STOP BITS LIKE THIS
OH WELL YOU KNOW WE CAN'T RULE ANYTHING HOUSE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN ADVANTAGEOUS FOR STUFF BANK AT THE MOMENT GIVEN THE WAY THE POUND AS AT ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT LOWER THAN WHERE IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO SO IT DOES MAKE I'M A VERY ATTRACTIVE TARGET BUT AGAIN THIS WILL COME INTO PLAY WITH WHAT THERESA MAY OR SAYING IN THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THESE BUSINESS DEALINGS ARE BAD FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST BUT
IS THIS A COPPER VIED AND OFFER UP MY JOB FOR EXTRA GROWTH AND THAT COULD VERY WELL BE GOOD FOR THE BRITISH NATIONAL INTEREST AND JUST ONE QUIRK OF THE STEEL THE CHAIRMAN OF ARM IS A NAME THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT RECOGNISE STUART CHAMBERS HE WAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF PILKINGTON ANOTHER GREAT BRITISH INDUSTRIAL NAME AND IT WAS BOUGHT BY
THE JAPANESE AND TWO THOUSAND SIX IF HE MIGHT HAVE CALLED ON SOME OLD FRIENDS IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE JAPAN HAD BEEN DOING A LOT OF THEM AND OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS SO HE'S GOOD HE'S INVOLVED IN THIS AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRENDA KELLY AS ONE IMPORTANT BRITISH COMPANY LOOKS IT TO LEAVE THE U.K. ANOTHER WAS COMING BACK THIS IS ANY OS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST CHEMICALS COMPANY
# IT MOVED ITS H.Q. HOW TO BRITAIN SIX YEARS AGO IT WENT TO SWITZERLAND BUT NOW PART OF IT IS COMING BACK ASSETS AS AS IS IT'S EXCUSE ME IT'S CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER THE BILLIONAIRE JIM RATCLIFF ONE OF THE U.K.'S RICHEST PEOPLE AND A MAN WHO HAS PLANNED BY THE WAY WILL HEAR A BIT MORE ABOUT THE SLATER TO REVIVE THE LANDROVER DEFENDER WE'RE JOINED FROM MANCHESTER BY TOM CROCKY A DIRECTORATE ANY US TOM CAN YOU TELL US WHICH BIT OF ANY OFFICERS COMING BACK TO BRITAIN AND WON
AH GOOD MORNING DOMINIC WELL WE'LL END UP WITH ABOUT HALF OF OUR BUSINESS BACK IN THE U.K. PRO MARYLEE ALL OF WHAT WE CALL A UPSTREAM BUSINESS OUR OIL AND GAS BUSINESS SO WE BOUGHT A BIG GAS BUSINESS LAST YEAR WE NOW SUPPLY GASSED ABOUT ONE IN TEN U.K. HOMES
I SHELL GAS BUSINESS IS THAT DEVELOPS WILL BE U.K. BASED OUR BUSINESS UP IN GRANGEMOUTH OBVIOUSLY A BIG REFINERY UP THERE IS U.K. BASED AND A BIG NEW GLOBAL P.B. SEE BUSINESS WHICH WE SET UP FOR THIS VERY RECENTLY THAT'S ALL U.K. BASED AND END THE MOVED TO SWITZERLAND WAS IT WAS A BIT TO DO WITH TEXT WAS A BIT TO DO WITH THE ROW OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THAT GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE WIN WIN YOUR SCONE TO TROUBLE AFTER THE AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS BUT WHY WHY NOW WHY COME BACK TO BRITAIN
I THINK THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS THE MAIN REASON IS BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF BUSINESS WERE DOING IN THE U.K. HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY SO THE ACQUISITION LAST YEAR OF A GAS BUSINESS HAS BEEN A BIG INCREASE IN OUR TOTAL OPERATION IN THE U.K. THE GROWTH OF OUR GRANGEMOUTH BUSINESS NOW BECAUSE AS OF THE AUTUMN WE'RE GOING TO BE BRINGING SHELL GAS IN FROM AMERICA INTO GRANGEMOUTH THAT'S GOING TO REJUVENATE THAT BUSINESS WE'RE REINVESTING MASSIVELY IN IT WE'RE SPENDING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ON THAT BUSINESS UP THERE
SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE JUST COMING AT THE SAME TIME IN THE NOW'S THE RIGHT TIME IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE JIM RADCLIFFE HAS GOT SICK OF THE TASTE OF SWISS CHEESE AND SHANNAH CUCKOO CLOCKS NO ABSOLUTELY NOT IT'S NELSON TELL US A BIT ABOUT SHOW YOU'RE YOU ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PLAYERS IN FACT PROBABLY THE BIGGEST PLAYER IN THE PUSH TO DEVELOP SHELL GUESS IN BRITAIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT AND I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO QUITE A LOT MORE AREN'T YOU YES WE ARE I MEAN WE WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE FOURTEENTH ROUND LAST YEAR LICENCES WE NOW HAVE ABOUT A MILLION ACRES UNDER LICENCE
BACK END OF THIS YEAR AND THROUGH INTO NEXT YEAR WE'RE GOING TO BE APPLYING FOR PLANNING TO DO QUITE A BIT OF TEST DRILLING SO YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF PLANNING APPLICATIONS COME IN RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING ALL THE SEISMIC TESTING ACROSS ALL THE AREAS THROUGH THE NORTH OF ENGLAND SO THAT'S GOING TO COME THROUGH HOPEFULLY TO FRUITION IN THE NEXT SIX TO NINE MONTHS IS IT IS THERE ANY IMPEDIMENT TO YOU DOING TEST RUNNING YOU CAN DO CHEST DRILLING BUT YOU CAN'T PRODUCE THE GAS IS THAT ONE THERE IS I MEAN IT'S THE SAME IMPEDIMENT EACH STAGE FOR YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO HAVE PLANNING PERMISSION AND TO DO THAT
YOU HAVE TO GET LOCAL PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING THE BENEFITS AND WE'RE SPENDING A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME GOING ROUND TALKING TO LOCAL PEOPLE TRYING TO GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN MANAGE THE RISK ISSUES AND AS IMPORTANTLY WE CAN BRING A HUGE AMOUNT OF PROSPERITY TO PARTS OF THE U.K. THAT REALLY REALLY NEED IT NOW SEEMS A BIT OF A LEAP BUT NOT ONLY SHALL GUESS BUT ALSO THE LANDROVER DEFENDER WHICH ANY OS LOOKING AT BUYING THE RIGHTS TO THE LAND ROVER DEFENDER OF JAGGER AND UPWARDS WHICH HAS STOPPED MAKING UP WHY DOESN'T WANT TO DO THIS AND WE WANT TO BUILD IT
WHY FIRST OF ALL IS BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IT'S A GREAT VEHICLE WE THINK THERE IS STILL A NICHE MARKET FOR IT WE CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT FOR A LARGE COMPANY LIKE JAIL I YOU MAKE SOME FANTASTIC VEHICLES IT MIGHT THE OLD LAND ROVER DEFENDER MIGHT NOT FIT WITH THEM ANY MORE WE THINK THERE STILL A MARKET FOR IT WHERE WE DON'T KNOW YET WE'RE DOING A BIG STUDY RIGHT NOW IT WILL COME TO FRUITION HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF DECEMBER THAT POT WILL MAKE HER DECISIONS BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THIS IN THE U.K. WE'D LIKE TO
# RE ESTABLISH THEIR BEST OF U.K. MANUFACTURING WE THINK THAT THE FLOOR WITH THE OLD CAR WAS ITS RELIABILITY WE'D WANT TO MAKE THE BEST OFF ROADER THAT IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND WE THINK THERE'S A MARKET THERE IF WE CAN DO THAT FANTASTIC THANKS VERY MUCH TOM CROCKY OF ANY US WELL IT'S A NEW WEEK SOAP TIME PERHAPS FOR ANOTHER GLOOMY FORECAST FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY THE Y. Y. ITEM CLUB THIS IS THE FORECASTING GROUP THAT USES THE SAME ECONOMIC MODEL HAS THE TREASURY
AS WE FACE A SHORT SHARP SHOCK AFTER THE REFERENDUM BUT THE FALL OF THE POUND WILL CUSHION THE ECONOMY BY BOOSTING BRITISH EXPORTS DOWN THE LINE FROM YORK AS PETER SPENCER THE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO THE Y. Y. ITEM
PETER WHAT ARE YOU SAYING WHAT HAPPENED TO GROWTH OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS WELL WE ARE ABOUT TO SLOW WE'VE ALREADY SEEN GROWTH SLOW AS WE RUN INTO THE REFERENDUM RESULT PARTICULARLY WE'VE SEEN FALLS AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AN INVESTMENT AND NOW THAT WE'VE SEEN THE RESULTS OF THE VOTE TO LEAVE THE UNCERTAINTY THAT THAT CASTS OVER BUSINESS PLANNING
UNTIL WE CAN ACTUALLY STRIKE SOME NEW TRADE DEAL WITH DE THAT UNCERTAINTY WILL SURELY HIT
IN BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND WE THINK THAT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE WILL TAKE A KNOCK AS WELL BUT AS YOU SAY THERE IS THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THERE FOR EXPORTERS WHO STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AT LEAST WITH THAT LOW APPARENT JUST GIVE SOME OF THEIR NUMBER PETER'S NUMBERS PETER WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING GROWTH TO BE THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IT TO BE NOW
WELL WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON NEXT YEAR THE MOMENTUM IN THE ECONOMY SHOULD MEAN THAT WILL GROW BY SAY ONE POINT NINE PER CENT CALLED TWO PER CENT THIS YEAR BUT THE REAL WORRY IS ABOUT NEXT YEAR
WE WE WERE LOOKING FOR GROWTH OF TWO AND A HALF PER CENT NEXT YEAR ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE ALL OF THAT INVESTMENT THAT HAD BEEN HELD UP BY THE REFERENDUM WE SAW THAT COMING THROUGH UNFORTUNATELY WON'T THAT WILL REMAIN ON HOLD SO THAT TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT GROWTH FIGURE AS BEEN REVISED DOWN TO NOUGHT POINT FOUR PER CENT ESSENTIALLY
SO ALMOST ALMOST ALMOST NO GROWTH NEXT YEAR WELL THERE IT'S GOING TO BE GROWTH NEXT YEAR BUT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO FIND AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT IN OVERSEAS MARKETS I'M AFRAID SHOULD THE BANK OF ENGLAND BE CUTTING RATES AT THE MOMENT
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAVE A VERY DELICATE PROBLEM BECAUSE IF THEY CUT RATES TOO FAST AND BUILD UP THEIR PORTFOLIO OF QUANTITATIVE EASING THEN THAT COULD UNDERMINE THE POUND EVEN FURTHER AND CAUSE MORE INFLATION
THAN WE'RE ALREADY WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT TWO AND A HALF PER CENT PLUS INFLATION NEXT YEAR SO THEY HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMY WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE EXCHANGE RATE A VERY DELICATE BALANCING ACT THANK YOU VERY MUCH PETER SPENCER OF THE ITEM CLUB
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT OF DAIRY IN THERE JUST AS YOU WERE IN THE DIG NICE LET'S DO IT IN CONCERT HERE IS SONALI

# IT'S NOW TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE AND CHRIS ALDRIDGE IS HERE WITH THE NEW M.P.S WILL DECIDE TODAY WHETHER TO APPROVE THE REPLACEMENT OF BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR ARMED SUBMARINE SUCH AN ESTIMATED COST OF AT LEAST THIRTY ONE BILLION POUNDS THERESA MAY WILL SAY THE COUNTRY'S ULTIMATE SAFEGUARD CAN'T BE ABANDONED OUT OF MISPLACED IDEALISM LABOUR M.P.S ARE DIVIDED ON THE ISSUE THE S.N.P. WILL VOTE AGAINST
# PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS CALLED FOR RESTRAINT AND UNITY AFTER THREE POLICE OFFICERS WERE SHOT DEAD IN BATON ROUGE LOUISIANA THE GUNMEN ON AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO'D SERVED IN THE MARINES WAS KILLED HE POSTED VIDEO MESSAGES ON THE INTERNET COMPLAINING ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AT THE HANDS OF POLICE AND CALLING FOR BLACK MEN TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR RACE
# ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARMOUR HOLDINGS HAS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT'S BEING BOUGHT BY A JAPANESE FIRM SOFT BANK ARM HOLDINGS EMPLOYS MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CAMBRIDGE ITS MICROCHIP DESIGNS ARE USED IN DEVICES SUCH AS APPLES I PHONE
# EUROPEAN UNION FOREIGN MINISTERS WHO MEET TODAY ARE EXPECTED TO CALL ON THE TURKISH PRESIDENT REG ATTIRE BUT ADAMANT TO RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AS HE DEALS WITH THOSE WHO ORGANISE THE FAILED COUP AGAINST HIM MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DETAINED OVER THE WEEKEND INCLUDING GENERALS JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS
# THE FORMER FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY SAID FOREIGN NATIONALS WITH LINKS TO RADICAL ISLAM SHOULD BE EXPELLED FROM FRANCE IMMEDIATELY HE SAID THE LORRY ATTACK IN THESE EXPOSED THE GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY
# THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN M. PEAS WILL DEBATE TRIED AND TODAY WHETHER TO REPLACE THE EXISTING VANGUARD SUBMARINES OR SCRAPPED THE WHOLE SYSTEM NORMAN SMITH HIS ASSISTANT POLITICAL ADDED A NUMBER START ABOUT THE THE VOTE NORMAN NO I THINK M.P.S WERE ALMOST CERTAINLY VOTE OVERWHELMINGLY TO RENEW OUR COMMITMENT TO THE TRIDENT SUBMARINE AS M.P.S HAVE DONE EVERY TIME THEY VOTED ON IT SINCE TONY BLAIR'S GOVERNMENT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HAS BEEN CONFIRMED AND EVERY SUCCESSIVE
STRATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW SO TONIGHT'S VOTERS PRIME MARILEE A SYMBOLIC BUT IT IS ALSO DEEPLY POLITICAL TO MISSUS MAY WANTS TO SHE'LL BE OPENING THE DEBATE SHE WANTS TO UNDERSCORE
BUT SHE'S GETTING ON WITH THE HEAVY LIFTING OFF GOVERNMENT SHE WANTS TO BIND THE WOUNDS OF THE TORY PARTY AFTER THE PROFOUNDLY DEVICE OF BRECHT'S HAD VOTES SHE WANTS TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD BRITAIN IS STILL ENGAGED IN GLOBAL SECURITY ISSUES AND YES SHE WANTS TO CHUCK A POLITICAL HAND GRENADE INTO THE RANKS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY WHERE THE VOTE WILL EXPOSE PROFOUND AND ENTRENCHED
DIVISIONS WITH LABOUR'S SET TO PERFORM A THREE WAY SPLIT UNDER THE GUISE OF A FREE VOTE SO MISTER CORBIN WILL VOTE AGAINST IT'S LONG BEEN ESTABLISHED POSITION TO BE OPPOSED TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT IN DOING SO WILL IN EFFECT REBEL AGAINST HIS OWN PARTY'S POLICY ON TRIDENT WHICH IS TO RENEW
HIS SHADOW DEFENCE FOREIGN SECRETARIES CLIVE LEWIS AND EMILY THORNBERRY WILL ABSTAIN BECAUSE THEY SAY THIS VOTE AS A GIMMICK AND THE COSTS HAVE NOT BEEN BOTTOMED OUT HIS DEPUTY LEADER
WE'LL BACK RENEWAL AND IN THE PROCESS OF CRITICISED ABSTENTION IS UNACCEPTABLE AND ALSO HAS CHIDED THE BIG UNION LEADERS LIKE LEN MCCLUSKEY FOR BACKING MISTER CORBIN BUT AT THE SAME TIME WANTING SECURITY OVER DEFENCE JOBS AND ALL THIS
HAS ALSO BECOME EMBROILED IN THE WHOLE LEADERSHIP CONTEST WITH MISTER CORBIN SAYING HE WANTS TO MAKE A STANCE ON TRIDENT CENTRAL TO HIS CAMPAIGN WHILE ANGELA EAGLE ARE KNOWN SMITH HAVE SIGNALLED THEY DO WANT TRY AND RENEWED RIGHT SO THE UPSHOT OF ALL THIS IS THE TRIDENT WILL BE RENEWED LABOUR RULE WILL BE MORE DAMAGED YES I MEAN
IN A FUNNY SORT OF WAY THE VOTE HE'S ALMOST ACADEMIC AND THIS SENSE THAT BY THE TIME OF THE NEXT ELECTION THE MONEY THE BUILDING WORK WILL ALREADY BE WELL UNDER WAY FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE FOUR TRIDENT SUBMARINES REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER LABOUR'S DEFENCE REVIEW COMES UP WITH EXCEPT TO SAY TWO THINGS JOHN IF LABOUR WERE TO WIN
THE NEXT ELECTION THERE MISTER CORBIN HAS ALREADY SAID HE WOULD NOT PRESS A NUCLEAR BUTTON SEWN AWAY THE DETERRENT WOULD BE REDUNDANT BUT THERE IS A MORE PRACTICAL POSSIBILITY IN THAT THE NUCLEAR WARHEADS THEMSELVES HAVE TO BE VOTED ON I THINK IN TWENTY TWENTY NOW IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IF MISTER CORBIN WAS TO CHANGE HIS PARTY'S POSITION ON TRIDENT ANTI WERE TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION THEN IN THAT FOR HER LABOUR COULD REFUSED TO RENEW
THE MISSILES SO YOU COULD END UP WITH A SITUATION WHICH MISTER CORBIN HAS MOOTED BEFORE A BUILDING THE SUBMARINE'S THEREBY PROTECTING DEFENCE JOBS BUT NOT EQUIPPING THEM WITH NUCLEAR WARHEADS NORMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH BE TOLD OF THE DEFENCE SECRETARY AT TEN PAST EIGHT
# IT'S TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE U.S. REPUBLICAN PARTY ARE HOLDING THEIR ANNUAL CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND ARE HIGHER THIS WEEK DONALD TRUMP WILL FINALLY BE ANOINTED THE PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE JIM KNOCKED IS THERE AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE MOOD AT THE CONVENTION
THE AT THE EVENT AND BATON ROUGE

THAT IT HAS ON THE WHOLE POLITICAL ARGUMENT BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE CONVENTION ORGANISED BY THE PUBLICAN'S HERE ENTITLED MAKE
A BIGGER AFTER THE EVENT
THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT DONALD TRUMP IS MAKING LAW AND ORDER ONE OF THE BIG THEMES OF THIS CONVENTION
ALONG WITH MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN DO BETTER DEALS AROUND THE WORLD
MUM OF COURSE SPOKE EARLIER TODAY ABOUT THIS NOT BEING AT

BUT AT THE CONTEST FOR THE PRESENTLY AT ALL ABOUT AND NOBODY
DEVICE WOULD BE BETTER THAN MY COMPANY WOULD TAKE THAT HIMSELF I MEAN THAT'S NOT A BIT
ME AND IT IS AS YOU SAY IT'S A WEEK LONG FOUR DAY EVENT WHAT'S THE POINT OF IT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT FOUR DAYS WELL YOU'RE GOING TO BE NOMINATED THAT'S A POINT OF IT AFTER THE PRIME TO GIVE YOU
FOOD
THE GREAT LAUNCHING PAD FOR THE CAMPAIGN PROPER
AFTER THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AND HILLARY CLINTON DOMINATION
MOST PECULIAR CONVENTION
AND IN THE TRUMP STYLE WE'RE GOING TO HELP SPORT TRUMPED CHILLED
ON THE VERY NIGHT IN PRIME TIME QUITE APART FROM THE MAN HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE
THE PARTY AND THEY'RE ALL OF REPUBLICAN FIELD BY MOTHER
COULD BE THE GUY HE'S
HE'S HAD A FEW DRINKS AT THE BAR
ABOUT WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE THAT WRONG
GOT TO START COMING UP WITH
BUT PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE
RIGHT NOW HE WOULD SAY WELL THE POLLS I'M BAD ON THE ARM BAD FOR HIM BUT I THINK IF HE DOESN'T SLIGHTLY CHANGES TO THEM THIS WEEK
A BIT THEN ALL THAT MOMENTUM THAT HE'S BUILT UP
BUT HE'S GOT FROM PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRAIN TO WATCH SOMETHING DIFFERENT WANT SOMEBODY FROM OUTSIDE POLITICS I'LL REPORT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME
BUILT JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM HERE IN OHIO A THAT ANGER AND IT'S VERY POOR
# AND THAT IS A CHALLENGE THIS WEEK DEMS KNOTTY THANKS VERY MUCH TWENTY TO SEVEN AND WE'RE ABOUT TO GET MORE EVIDENCE OF HOW RUSSIA HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING IT ATHLETES TO CHEAT AT THE OLYMPICS DOWN RHONE A SPORTS EDITOR IS ON THE LINE ARE DOWN THIS COULD BE A DEVASTATING REPORT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED TODAY IT COULD JOHN YES PERHAPS ONE OF MOST DAMAGING DAYS IN THE HISTORY OF THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT BECAUSE
ALL THIS STEMS FROM EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS OF STATE BACK TO TREATING IN RUSSIA THAT THE FORMER HEAD OF MOSCOW'S DRUGS TESTING LABORATORY MADE BACK IN MAY GRIGORY RODCHENKO OFF HAS TURNED WHISTLEBLOWER HE'S NOW LIVING IN HIDING IN THE UNITED STATES AND HE AND EFFECT SAID THAT HE'D
IT'S SABOTAGE THE SORT SHE TWENTY FOURTEEN WINTER OLYMPICS DOPING DOZENS OF RUSSIAN ATHLETES IN A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED CONSPIRACY A PLOT OR ORCHESTRATED WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT ITSELF HE'S CLAIMS READ LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A CRIME NOVEL HE SAID THE DRUGS TEST SAMPLE BOTTLES SUPPOSEDLY TAMPER PROOF WERE BROKEN INTO AND SWITCHED THROUGH A HOLE IN THE WALL OF THE LAB AT NIGHT WITH THE HELP OF THE SECURITY SERVICES
THAT SHEETS WERE PROTECTED OTHER MAJOR EVENTS TO RUSSIA STRONGLY DENIED THESE ALLEGATIONS AND SAYS IT HASN'T HAD A CHANCE TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS HIS CLAIMS BUT IF AS EXPECTED A LAW PROFESSOR RICHARD MCLAREN COMMISSION BY THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY CONCLUDED TODAY IN WHAT'S THOUGHT TO BE A DAMNING REPORT THE ENTIRE OLYMPIC ANTI DOPING PROGRAMME WAS INDEED SUBVERTED AND OTHER SPORTS AND EVENTS PERHAPS THAT RUSSIA WAS HOSTED IN RECENT YEARS WERE ALSO AFFECTED THERE WILL INEVITABLY BE OVERWHELMING PRESSURE
ON THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE TO BAN THE ENTIRE RUSSIAN TEAM FROM THE FORTHCOMING RIO GAMES WELL HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PART IN THOSE GAMES IF THIS THESE FINDINGS ARE UPHELD THAT'S WHAT MANY WILL ARGUE THAT THE COUNTRY'S TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETES ALREADY PART AFTER A PREVIOUS WILD REPORT LAST YEAR FOUND EVIDENCE OF STATE SPONSORED CHEATING IF THE ENTIRE TEAM WAS THROWN OUT IT WOULD MEAN FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN RUSSIA BOYCOTTED THE APE THE LOS ANGELES GAMES THE WORLD'S LARGEST COUNTRY WILL BE ABSENT FROM
SPORT'S BIGGEST MEGA EVENT IN THE FALLOUT OF COURSE WOULD BE CONSIDERABLE NOR SPLITS ALREADY OPENING UP ON ONE SIDE YOU HAVE THE U.S. ANTI DOPING AGENCY ALONG WITH TEN OTHER NATIONAL ANTI DOPING AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD TWENTY ATHLETE GROUPS REPRESENTING OLYMPIANS HAVE ALSO ALL COME TOGETHER TO DEMAND A TOTAL RUSSIA BAN IF MCLAREN'S REPORTERS AS DAMNING AS AS WE EXPECT ON THE OTHER THE I.O.C. ITSELF
WHOSE PRESIDENT THOMAS BARK HAS SAID THAT IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO PUNISH CLEAN RUSSIAN ATHLETES COLLECTIVE JUSTICE WOULD BE WRONG HE SAYS FOR THIS WRONGDOING BUT JUST TWO WEEKS OUT FROM THE RIO GAMES EVENT THAT ALREADY HAS ENOUGH CONCERNS FROM ZEKE ER TO SECURITY TO BE TO THE TO THE BRAZILIAN ECONOMY THIS IS CERTAINLY THE LAST THING THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT NEEDS DOWN MANY MORE ON THIS LATER EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS
# A WOMAN IS PICTURED ON THE FRONT OF THE TIMES AT A FUNERAL IN ANKARA FOR A FAMILY MEMBER KILLED DURING THE FAILED COUP THERE EYES CLOSED SHE LATER HEAD AND ARMS ON HER COFFIN COVERED IN THE TURKISH FLAG THE PAPER SAYS A REGIONAL CATASTROPHE HAS BEEN AVERTED BUT IN PRESIDENT HEARD WHEN THE WORLD NOW FACES THE PROSPECT OF A VENGEFUL ISOLATED AND UNPREDICTABLE LEADER
THE GUARDIAN REPORTS THAT MY WHEN SOBBED UNCONTROLLABLY WHEN HE TRIED TO EULOGISE ARE FATHER AND SON AT A FUNERAL IN ISTANBUL YESTERDAY IT SAYS HE'S RIDING A WAVE OF POPULAR ANGER AGAINST THE COUP PLOTTERS AND HAS BEGUN A PURGE OF THE TURKISH STATE THAT LYING IN THE MALE TURKEY FEAR OF MIGRANTS SURGIT SUGGEST OF THE FAILED COUP MEANS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION'S DEAL WITH ANKARA TO STOP PEOPLE CROSSING THE MEDITERRANEAN IS IN DOUBT BECAUSE MIGRANTS COULD ARGUE THAT TURKEY IS NO LONGER SAFE
# THE MIRROR CONCENTRATE ON WHAT HE CALLS COO HELD FOR WHOLE BRITS AND DESPERATE BRITONS ARE RUSHING TO CANCEL THEIR HOLIDAYS IN TURKEY IT SAYS BUT BECAUSE THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAS NOT ADVISED AGAINST TRAVEL THERE THEY COULD BE LEFT OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE TOUR OPERATORS WILL NOT HAVE TO COVER THEIR COSTS THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON WRITES IN THE TELEGRAPH THAT TODAY'S COMMONS VOTE ON THE RENEWAL OF BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM IS A FITTING WAY FOR THERESA MADE TO BEGIN HER TENURE AS PRIME MINISTER
HE SAYS DEFENCES THE FIRST DUTY OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NUCLEAR BOATS PROVIDE THE ULTIMATE GUARANTEE OF OUR SECURITY THE GUARDIAN INTERVIEW JEREMY CORBIN AT YESTERDAY'S TOLPUDDLE MARTYRS FESTIVAL IN DORSET AND REPORT HE'LL BE PUTTING NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AT THE HEART OF HIS LEADERSHIP ELECTION CAMPAIGN HE TELLS HER PAPER THE U.K. AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD
# FINANCIAL TIME SAYS THE TURF BATTLES ARE OPEN OPENING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE IN WHITEHALL FOLLOWING THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAS BEEN HOLLOWED OUT IT SAYS WITH MANY OF BORIS JOHNSON'S OFFICIALS TRANSFERRED TO THE NEW MINISTRY FOR BRECK'S IT LED BY DAVID DAVIES THE SUN SAYS MY JOHNSON WILL BE SPIED UPON FROM WITHIN SO ALAN DUNCAN A KEY ALLY OF MISSUS MAY WAS APPOINTED AS HIS NUMBER TWO YESTERDAY
IN THE TELEGRAPH DAVID CAMERON'S FORMER COMMUNICATIONS SHE WONDERS WHETHER MISTER DAVIS'S STAFF WILL BE ABLE TO DEEP DIVE INTO THE WIRING'S OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS WHAT AUTHORITY WE HAVEN'T EXACTLY MY PILLS AND ASKS SO IS MY DAVIES IS AN INDEPENDENT THINKER TO PUT IT POLITELY AND THERE WAS A POTENTIAL FOR FIREWORKS IT'S NOW COMING UP TO QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT THE FUTURE OF BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR DEFENCES WILL BE DECIDED BY M.P.S WHEN THEY VOTE TODAY ON WHETHER TO REPLACE THE FOUR SUBMARINES THAT CARRY TRIDENT MISSILES
# NOW THEN THE
FRENCH AUTHORITIES HAVE DETAINED A THIRD PERSON IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRUCK ATTACK IN NICE A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MAN HE'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS PART OF THE ATTACKERS ENTOURAGE THE FORMER FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY HAS CRITICISED THE GOVERNMENT FOR WHAT HE CALLED ITS FAILURE TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY AGAINST TERRORIST ATTACKS
THE BULLY BOBBY FALCON COMPLAIN CHRONITON GEAR BUT FIRST YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE ARE AT WAR TOTAL WAR OUR ENEMIES HAVE NOTED BOOZE NO BOUNDARIES NO PRINCIPLES SO I'M GOING TO USE STRONG WORDS
IT WILL BE THEM OR US AND WE WILL HAVE TO BE DETERMINED TO SEE THIS THROUGH NOT JUST IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE TERRIBLE TRAGEDY OF NEEDS BUT OVER SEVERAL YEARS BUSKERS SAVAGE
WELL CAMILLE GRANT IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE FOUNDATION FOR STRATEGIC RESEARCH IT'S A THINK TANK ON DEFENCE AND SECURITY ISSUES A GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING FRANCE AT WAR TOTAL WAR THE QUESTION IS HOW THAT WAR SHOULD BE WAGED IS THIS SOME SENSE IN FRANCE EMERGING OF WHAT POSSIBLE ANSWERS ARE
WELL IT'S WE ARE FACING DIFFICULT TIMES OVER THE LAST YEAR OR LEGISLATION HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED OR MILITARILY HAD BEEN PUT ON THE STREETS OR ER THE ARTIST BEING THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY SO THE EAD THE SITUATION DO YOU ABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR THAT MATTER TO YOUR POSITION TO INTRODUCE NEW LEGISLATION YOU TOLD US TO FIGHT TERRORISM IS LIMITED
ESPECIALLY IN DELIGHT OF THE LATEST THE TURKS ATTACKING WHICH WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF ATTACK WHICH IS ALIEN PREDICTABLE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO DETECT EARTH THROUGH INTELLIGENCE STOOD INDIVIDUALLY PERPETRATED THE ATTACK IT'S NOT BEEN INFERIOR THAT'S NOT BEEN IN IRAQ A YOU'RE NOT BEEN TRAINED BY CASES
AND ER WHERE'S NOT EVEN ON THE RADAR SCREEN THAT'S THE RADICALISED AND TERRORIST SO THAT'S IT IS THAT MAKES THE STRIKE AGAINST TERRORISM EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED EVEN THOUGH THERE'S BEEN SOME SUCCESS THANKS TO SECURITY FORCES THERE'S BEEN
THIS FADED VERY GOOD CARROTS THAT HAVE BEEN DETECTED PRIORITY THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME OF THE NETWORKS THAT THEY'VE BEEN SMOKED AND SO WE LEFT THAT SENT FOR LOOK AUGUST VERITY SITUATION
WHICH MAKES ER JUDGEMENT COMPLICATED IT MEASURES EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO DESIGN WHAT IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THIS MAN WHO CARRIED OUT TO THE WITH A TRUCK ATTACK HAD BEEN VERY RECENTLY RADICALISED BUT WE HAD THE INFORMATION IS STILL ONLY COMING IN ON THAT ISN'T IT WE DON'T KNOW
IT'S VERY PRECISE WE HAVE A VERY AWKWARD PROFILE MANY WEANS AND AURAL HOME SECRETARY SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS THIS SOME SORT OF STRUCK RADICALISATION
IN FACT WE HAVE A PROFILE THAT COMBINES A TEA TREE NO VIOLENT VIOLENT MAN WITH SOME ELEMENTS THAT POINTED TO SOME SORT OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER
BUT ALL SURE IF SOME OF CONVERSION TO A RED SCUM
INDO LATEST WEEKS THAT PROBABLY GAVE IN HE MEANING TRUE TO COOK FOR TRADE THESE ACTIONS OR SIBLING IN OTHER TIMES HE WOULD HAVE SIMPLY COMMITTED SUICIDE OR ACT AGAINST HER FAMILY
AND I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS NICOLAS SARKOZY WAS CALLING FOR WAS ANY FOREIGN NATIONALS WITH LINKS TO RADICAL ISLAM TO BE EXPELLED FROM FRANCE PRACTICALLY IS THAT POSSIBLE AND IS THERE A PUBLIC APPETITE FOR SUCH A FORM OF CLAMPED
THE PUBLIC APPETITE FOR USE THERE NOW THAT WE ARE FACING SECOND LARGE SCALE IT'S A KING IN A PERIOD OF LESS THAN A YEAR WITH STUFF DARK GOODS WHICH MAKE EVERYONE FEEL VERY
OR POTENTIALLY TARGETED SINCE THE ATTACKS OF MOVES FROM LIFTS THE EYE DUMPTY FIGHT TARGETS TO A RANDOM ATTACKS WHEREVER THERE IS A PUBLIC GATHERING
SHOULD THE DEED THERE IS AN APPETITE FOR FOR TOUGH MEASURES THE PROBLEM IS WE EAST TOUGHER MEASURES WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE
WE INTRODUCED IN CONTRAST A NEW WING AT THE GENTS LAW WHICH IS OUT THERE VERY VERY EARLY AND HE WAS OF NUTRIENT STORING DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE THERE WAS THIS DEBATE ON WHETHER WE COULD
HE'S REFUSED FRENCH FASHION HE'D TO BY NATIONAL HAD ACQUIRED FRENCH NATIONAL LYCHEE YEAH DO ALL OF THESE ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO BITS WHICH YOU TOOK IT SERIOUSLY YOU CAN QUESTION BUT ALSO WHETHER IT'S A PRACTICAL MEASURE KEMI A GRANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# TEN TO SEVEN M. P. IS ALTHOUGH TODAY ON WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE TRIDENT NUCLEAR SYSTEM TO DEAL WITH THAT THE SCRAP IT AND IF IT WAS LEFT TO THE PUBLIC TO DECIDE WELL JOE TWYMAN IS THE HEAD OF POLITICAL OR SOCIAL IF YOU GO WITH ME AND ALSO ON THE LINE IS SARAH SMITH OFF ASK SCOTLAND EDITOR JOE PUBLIC NOT MASSIVELY ENTHUSIASTIC BUT BROADLY
THAT'S RIGHT THE REPLACEMENT FOR TRIDENT ESSENTIALLY ON A LIKE FOR LIKE BASIS IS THE MOST POPULAR OPTION BUT IT'S BY NO MEANS OVERWHELMINGLY POPULAR FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF PEOPLE SAY REPLACEMENT THAT'S DOUBLE THE NUMBER THAT SAY GET RID OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS COMPLETELY AND ONLY JUST OVER ONE IN TEN SAYS ALL ACTUALLY THIS HALFWAY MEASURE OF HAVING THE SUBMARINES BUT NOT THE NUCLEAR ON COMMIS THAT'S JEREMY I DID YES THAT'S RIGHT
AND THEY DON'T LIKE THAT NO THAT'S NOT THE MOST POPULAR AND EVEN AMONG THE LABOUR PARTY IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT LABOUR SUPPORT AND TWENTY FIFTEEN YOU SEE THAT THAT'S WHERE THE BIG DIVISION IN THE COUNTRY OR LIZA THIRD SAYING REPLACE A THIRD SAYING GET RID OF COMPLETELY REALLY VERY CLOSE
AND WHAT IF YOU DRILL DOWN A BIT AND SAY IF YOU CAN SPEND THE MONEY ON CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS OR WHATEVER DO YOU HAVE YOU DONE THAT SORT OF RESEARCH THEN IT GETS REALLY REALLY COMPLICATED COS PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A PARTICULARLY GOOD IDEA OF THIS ABOUT THIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEFENCE GENERALLY IS NOT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR PEOPLE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S RESONATING MASSIVELY AND JUST OVER ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAYS THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT ALL
DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY IDEAS OF THE DAYS WHEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MARCH THROUGH THE STREETS OF THIS COUNTRY THERE THAT THEY'VE GONE IT'S NOT SO MUCH NUCLEAR POWER NO THANKS IT'S MORE SORT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHO CARES WELL IT WELL THAT'S INTERESTING BUT THEY DO CARE IN SCOTLAND SARAH THEY CERTAINLY DO AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
LATER TODAY IS THAT THERE ARE FIFTY NINE M. PEAS AND SCOTLAND FIFTY EIGHT OF THEM ARE GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THE RENEWAL OF TRIED AND THAT'S THE FIFTY FOUR P. M. PEAS TO FORMER S.N.P. M.P.S PLUS ALSO THE ONLY LABOUR M.P. IN SCOTLAND AND THE ONLY LIB DEM M.P. IN SCOTLAND WE'LL ALL VOTE AGAINST RENEWAL SO THAT WILL LEAVE THE ONE TORY M.P. IN SCOTLAND THE SECRETARY OF STATE THERE AS THE SOLE SCOTTISH M. P. VOTING IN FAVOUR OF RENEWAL OBVIOUSLY IT WOULDN'T STOP THE RENEWAL OF TRYING BUT IT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE
THAT'S THE STORY THE S.N.P. ARE TELLING SCOTLAND AT THE MOMENT ABOUT THE DIVERGENCE BETWEEN POLITICS AND THE REST OF THE U.K. AND SCOTLAND BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME WITH THE VOTE ON THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHEN SIXTY TWO PER CENT OF SCOTS VOTED TO STAY IN IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE COUNTRY ARE MOVING IN OPPOSITE POLITICAL DIRECTIONS THE S.N.P. WILL SAY AND THEY WANT TO KEEP BUILDING UP THIS NARRATIVE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AS THEY
CONSIDER THE IDEA OF A SECOND REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE IF IT LOOKS LIKE SCOTLAND OR THE REST OF THE U.K. JUST CANNOT AGREE ON THINGS LIKE TRIDENT IT HELPS THEIR CASE AND POLITICIANS ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THAT IS THE PUBLIC DO YOU THINK THERE'S A WHOLE AWARE THAT DO YOU THINK PEOPLE IF YOU STOP HIM IN THE STREET DO THEY SAY YOU AND I I CAN SEE THAT SCOTLAND IS DIVERGING FROM THE REST OF BRITAIN
WELL OVER THE BREAKS AT VERY MUCH TRIDENT IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH SO MANY OF THE SCOTTISH M.P.S ARE AGAINST THE POLL SHOWS SCOTTISH VOTERS TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT HERE THE LATEST ONE THAT WAS DONE AND MADE TWENTY SIXTEEN HAD FORTY TWO PERCENT AGAINST THE RENEWAL OF TRIDENT FORTY THREE PERCENT IN FAVOUR OF IT'S GOTTEN OFTEN HAS BEEN SPLIT ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY ON TRIDENT IT'S QUITE A REAL POLITICAL ISSUE HERE BECAUSE OF COURSE
SUBMARINES ARE BASED IN SCOTLAND BECAME A HUGE TO TECHNICAL ISSUE DURING THE TWENTY FOURTEEN REFERENDUM OR THOSE WHO ARE AGAINST THE RENEWAL OF TRIDENT D'YOU FEEL IT VERY PASSIONATELY HUGE PROTESTS ACROSS SCOTLAND ON SATURDAY IN THIRTY SIX DIFFERENT TOWNS AND CITIES BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY THE MAJORITY OPINION AMONG VOTERS RIGHT JO HAVE YOU DONE ANY RESEARCH ON HOW
PEOPLE OF ENGLAND PEOPLE IN ENGLAND REGARD SCOTLAND IN THIS CONTEXT ARE THEY ARE WE MOVE AWAY FROM THEM MOTHER THEY MOVE MADE WORSE OR WHATEVER WELL WHEN IT COMES TO TRIDENT THERE'S NOT REALLY MUCH OF A PERCEPTION ABOUT WHERE THE WHERE THE COUNTRY LIES BE THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM BRITAIN ENGLAND OR SCOTLAND AND SCOTLAND IS MORTIFIED BUT NOT REALLY A PERCEPTION THAT'S THE THAT'S BEEN PICKED UP IN THE REST OF THE YEAR AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY JOE AND THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
# IT'S SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN FOR THE FIRST TIME ASTRONAUTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WILL ATTEMPT TO SEQUENCE D.N.A. THEY USING A VERY SMALL BIT OF KIT TO DO IT AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT WILL WORK IN MICROGRAVITY IT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE BRITISH COMPANY OXFORD NANO PORT TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR GENETICIST CECIL ALL IS IN NEW YORK HELLO TO YOU HELLO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THANKS FOR COMING ON CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE PLAN IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
YEAH I THINK FIRST LET ME JUST TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT D.N.A. D.N.A. ISN'T EVERYTHING THAT'S LIVING SO IT'S AN HOUR IN HUMANS IT'S GENES BUT IT'S ALSO IN BACTERIA AND PLANTS AND FUNGI AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK FOR D.N.A. YOU CAN LOOK FOR ALL THESE THINGS AND YOU CAN FIND BY THE SEQUENCING THEN YOU CAN FIND ONE ACTUALLY EARS AND IF IT'S HEALTHIER OR SICK OR CHANGING IN ANYWAY
SO IS THIS A CHECKING ON D.N.A. THAT WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TAKEN UP THEIR BACTERIA MICROBES THAT ARE ON THE SPACE STATION OR IS IT LOOKING FOR LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS BUT IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE SO ACTUALLY THIS IS THE WORKING WITH AN INCREDIBLE CREW AT NASA AND THEY'RE THE ONES RACHEL DECIDING ON THE PROJECT AND WE'RE ENABLING THEM TO DO IT WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY BUT FIRST OF ALL BE A PROOF OF CONCEPT WILL THE SEQUENCING ACTUALLY WORK IN SPACE AS IT DOES I KNOW
AND THEN MOVING FORWARD IT WILL BE THINGS LIKE THE ENVIRONMENT UP THERE SO REMEMBER WIDER AND AARON EVERYTHING IS RECYCLED I THINK THE WATER'S BEEN THERE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS SO LOOKING AT WHAT'S IN THE WATER IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE WATER LOOKING AT THOSE MICROBES AND LOOKING AT THEIR D.N.A. IS VERY IMPORTANT SO WILL THAT BE THE FIRST THING THAT'S TESTED BY THIS MACHINE
I DO NOT HAVE THE EXCEPT PLANS YET COS RIGHT NOW FIRST WILL JUST TESTS DOES IT ACTUALLY WORK AS WELL AS IT DOES ON EARTH AND HOW IT DOES THE VIBRATION IN LUNCH AND ALL THIS THE LONG TIME AND SPACE WILL THAT CHANGE THEM AND THE MICRO GRAVITY WILL THAT CHANGE HOW IT WORKS BUT THEN EVENTUALLY THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO LOOK AT AND THEN A PIECE OF KIT I MENTION IT'S VERY SMALL IT'S TINY ISN'T IT ONE HUNDRED NANOGRAMS OR SIZE OF A MARS BAR
OAK AND BUT IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY THAT YOU CAN SEQUENCE D.N.A. WITH SOMETHING THAT SIZE IT'S NOT PRESUMABLY WHAT YOU WOULD CHOOSE TO USE IT'S JUST THE CIRCUMSTANCES MEAN LOOK WE'VE GOT THIS BIT OF KIT THAT WORKS ON EARTH LET'S SEE IF IT WORKS UP THERE
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AS WELL WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND ARE THERE IN THE FIELD THEY'RE USED EVERYWHERE LOOKING AT HUMAN D.N.A. LOOKING AT SICKO IRA'S IMBECILE IN WEST AFRICA IT IF IT IS THE PREFERRED SEQUENCE OF A LOT OF
IF THE LABS O.K. SO SO THEN IT'S AS YOU'VE MET POINT OUT THE FIRST TEST WILL BE DOES IT ACTUALLY FUNCTION IN SPACE WILL THE ASTRONAUTS BE TESTING THEIR OWN D.N.A.
NOT THIS TIME ROUND AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY BUT EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY THEY WELL AN AWFUL ALSO THERE'S THIS THING CALLED THE MICRO BY ON BUGS THAN MICROGRAMS A LIVE INSIDE US AND ON OUR SKIN WE CAN TEST FOR THOSE THINGS AND SEE IF THEY'RE REACTING THE SAME WAY THERE THEY WERE ON EARTH AND OFFERED LOOKING AT LONGER SPACED LIGHTS LIKE WHEN YOU
THAT'S RIGHT HAVE TO BE AWAY FOR ME A LONG TIME HE'S VERY HELPFUL TO MONITOR THESE CABLE THINGS IN REAL LIFE O.K. SO THIS IS THE FIRST STAGE IN A PROCESS THAT YOU EXPECT TO BE OBVIOUSLY BE GOING ON FOR YEARS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT IS THREE MINUTES TO SEVERAL TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST

SOURCES CLOSE TO THE DEAL SO THE JAPANESE COMPANY THINKS ARM IS WELL PLACED TO EXPLOIT THE CYCLE INTERNET OF THINGS WHICH WILL SEE MICROCHIPS EMBEDDED IN A WHOLE NEW CATEGORY OF HOUSEHOLD AND BUSINESS DEVICES
TWENTY FOUR BILLION POUND TAKEOVER POSES INTERESTING QUESTIONS FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT THERESA MAY HAS PUT FOREIGN TAKEOVERS ON HER RADAR OF BUSINESS DEALINGS THAT MAY BE BAD FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST ON THE OTHER HAND THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE KEEN TO SHOW THAT THE VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS NO IMPEDIMENT TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT
THE B. B. C. UNDERSTANDS THE COMPANY WILL COMMIT TO DOUBLING THE SIZE OF ARMS U.K. WORKFORCE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS

HE SAID THE DRUGS TEST SAMPLE BOTTLES WERE BROKEN INTO AND SWITCHED AND THAT CHEATS WERE ALSO PROTECTED AT OTHER MAJOR EVENTS RUSSIA HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS BUT IF MCLAREN CONCLUDES THAT THE OLYMPIC ANTI DOPING PROGRAMME WAS SUBVERTED THERE WILL BE CALLS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE TO BAN THE ENTIRE RUSSIAN TEAM FROM THE FORTHCOMING RIO GAMES THE COUNTRY'S TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETES ALREADY BARRED AFTER A PREVIOUS REPORT FOUND EVIDENCE OF STATE SPONSORED DOPING LAST YEAR
# EUROPEAN UNION FOREIGN MINISTERS ARE EXPECTED TO CALL ON THE TURKISH PRESIDENT REG IT TYRE PAIRED TO RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW IN HUMAN RIGHTS AS HE DEALS WITH ALLEGED ORGANISERS OF THE FAILED COUP AGAINST HIM ON FRIDAY THE MINISTERS WHO ARE MEETING IN BRUSSELS WILL ALSO DISCUSSED TURKEY WITH THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY OVER THE WEEKEND MISTER EDWIN ACTED DECISIVELY AGAINST THOSE WHO ACCUSES OF BEING PART OF THE PLOT AS MARK GLOWING REPORTS FROM ISTANBUL
PRESIDENT ONE HAS TURNED AN ATTEMPTED COUP INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO LAUNCH A PURGE OF DISSENTERS AND ENTRENCH HIS CONTROL YET FURTHER
MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DETAINED INCLUDING SOLDIERS JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS ACCUSED OF BEING PLOTTERS OR FOLLOWERS OF THE EXILED PREACHER FED TO UGLY LEN WHO THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES WAS BEHIND
THE PRESIDENT SAYS AN EXTRADITION REQUEST WILL BE SENT TO THE U.S. WHERE MY LIVES BUT THE AMERICAN SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY HAS WARNED THAT CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF HIS INVOLVEMENT WOULD BE REQUIRED THE EXTRADITION IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN ESPECIALLY SINCE PRESIDENT ONE HAS TALKED OF REINTRODUCING THE DEATH PENALTY OUTLAWED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOR
# A MINUTE'S SILENCE WILL BE OBSERVED IN FRANCE THIS MORNING IN MEMORY OF THE EIGHTY FOUR PEOPLE KILLED IN THE LORRY ATTACK IN NICE ON THURSDAY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IS FACING ACCUSATIONS THAT IT HASN'T DONE ENOUGH TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY THE FORMER PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY HAS SAID FOREIGN NATIONALS LINKED TO RADICAL ISLAM SHOULD BE EXPELLED FROM THE COUNTRY IMMEDIATELY AS LUCY WILLIAMSON REPORTS FROM THESE
DEMOCRACY MUST NOT BE WEAK SAID MY SARKOZY NOR SIMPLY COMMEMORATE DEMOCRACY MUST SAY WE WILL WIN THE WAR
FRANCE'S GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT SEES ITSELF AT WAR WITH VIOLENT JIHADISTS BUT A THIRD MAJOR ATTACK IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS HAS LED TO CRITICISM OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADERS AND DIVISIONS OVER HOW TO RESPOND
FRANCE'S LATEST ATTACKER WASN'T TAGGED AS A JIHADIST NEIGHBOURS DESCRIBE MOHAMMED BUDDHA AS A VIOLENT LONER WHO LIKE TO DRINK LIFT WEIGHTS AND SALSA DANCE
FRANCE'S PRIME MINISTER HAS SUGGESTED THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN RADICALISED TOO QUICKLY TO TRIGGER THE AUTHORITIES' ATTENTION THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY OTHERS LIKE HIM ARE LIVING HERE
# A NEW STUDY SAYS PEOPLE AGED UNDER THIRTY FIVE COULD BECOME THE FIRST GENERATION TO EARN LESS THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR LIFETIME RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT BY THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION A THING TANK FOCUSING ON THE LIVING STANDARDS OF PEOPLE ON LOW AND MIDDLE INCOMES IT SAYS THE UNDER THIRTY FIVES EARNED ON AVERAGE EIGHT THOUSAND LESS DURING THEIR TWENTIES THAN THE PREVIOUS GENERATION
# THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN ARM HOLDINGS HE'S ONE OF THE U.K.'S BIGGEST AND MOST ADMIRED TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IT'S MICROCHIPS ARE IN BILLIONS OF DEVICES INCLUDING APPLES I FOUND TODAY IT'S BOARD WILL RECOMMEND THAT IT BE TAKEN OVER BY THE JAPANESE COMPANY SOFT BANK A DEAL WORTH TWENTY FOUR BILLION POUNDS WAS I'M A JACK A BUSINESS EDITOR IS HERE SIMON DO WE SEE THIS IS A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING
WELL THAT'S A QUESTION WE SEE IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING COS AS YOU SAY IT IS THE STANDARD BEARING COMPANY FOR ALL THIS IS GREAT ABOUT U.K. TECHNOLOGY ANY TIME ANYONE SAYS WHERE A ENTAILS WEAR OFF FACEBOOK WHAT ABOUT ARM HOLDINGS WHAT ABOUT THAT IT EMPLOYS THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CAMBRIDGE
VERY HIGHLY SKILLED AS WELL IT DESIGNS CHIPS GOING BILLIONS ARE DEVICES AS YOU SAY THE I PHONE LOTS OF OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND UP TO NOW IT HAS BEEN A STAUNCHLY AND FIERCELY INDEPENDENT COMPANY COS IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE SAID MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE BIG WOULD LIKE TO BUY THIS BUT WE'VE GOT A NEW MANAGER NEW MANAGING DIRECTOR NEW CHAIRMAN
AND THIS DID THAT DEAL TO SELL IT TO THIS BIG JAPANESE COMPANY WILL POSE A VERY ANCIENT QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND IT WILL SAY ARE WE OPEN FOR BUSINESS OUR WEE WELCOMING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT OR AS THERESA MAY SAID IN THE HOURS BEFORE SHE BECAME PRIME MINISTER I'LL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR HOSTILE FOREIGN TAKEOVERS WHICH BUT WHICH AGAINST THE NATIONAL INTEREST
WHAT SOFT BANK ARE SAYING IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF U.K. BASED EMPLOYEES SO I SUSPECT THAT THE LATTER THAT THIS IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS WITH THIS IS SHOWING THAT WE'RE OPEN THAT BREAKS IT HASN'T MEANT HASN'T DETERRED FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE U.K. BUT THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS TO BE THROWN UP HERE NOT LEAST U.K. BASED EMPLOYEES WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WE'VE GOT A LOT OF JAPANESE CODE IS COMING IN OR IS IT BRITISH WORKERS IT'S WELL THESE THESE PEOPLE WHO I DON'T GROW ON TREES UM OBVIOUSLY IT'S IT'S BASED IN CAMBRIDGE COS THAT'S A GREAT FINAL OF TALENT COMING OUT OF THAT UNIVERSITY
BUT THEY'RE NOT EASY TO COME BY SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO OVERSEAS TO GET THEM TO BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO HIRE THIS A THREE AND A HALF THOUSAND MORE HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE ARE WE GONNA SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE SO MANY FROM THE E.U. AND WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM PLACES LIKE JAPAN POSSIBLY INDIA THIS IS THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME SO THIS TWENTY FOUR BILLION POUND DEAL REALLY INSTEAD OF IN A NICE NEAT LITTLE NUTSHELL
CREATES A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION ABOUT WHAT OUR INDUSTRIAL STRETCH IS GOING TO BE AND IN WHOSE DECISION IS IT BECAUSE YOU WERE AS YOU SAY YOU HAVE IT THE BOARD RECOMMENDING IT TO SHAREHOLDERS IF IT WERE DOWN TO SHAREHOLDERS OR DOES THIS HAVE TO GO PAST THEIR PRIME AND NOW THIS IS A ULTIMATELY ADDISON DECISION FOR SHAREHOLDERS IN LESS THEY CAN POINT OUT THERE ARE SOME SECTORS WHERE IT'S VERY SENSITIVE WITH THIS IN DEFENCE IF IT WAS B.A.E. SYSTEMS YOU COULD SAY WELL ACTUALLY SOMETIMES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE GOLDEN SHARE
AND THEY COULD STOP THIS NOW THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THE GOVERNMENT COULDN'T MAKE IT DIFFICULT THEY COULD SAY IT COULD AFFECT THE TAKEOVER PANEL WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THIS BUT I THINK THAT THEY WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR THEM
TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS WAY BUT NEVERTHELESS A VERY INTERESTING TEST FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND A NEW INDUSTRIAL BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH AS YOU SAY THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TO PULL IT THEY CAN'T THEY WILL HAVE A COMMENT ON IT THERE WILL BE PUT AT THIS ISN'T THIS GREAT AW OH DEAR IT'S A FOREIGN TAKEOVER OF SOMETHING OF ITS TREASURES AND WE WE SAY TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AS IF IT'S OWNED BY MISTER AND MISSUS BIGGINS OR WHATEVER OF COURSE IT'S NOT IT'S OWNED BY INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS ALL OVER NEVERTHELESS IT IS A HOME GROWN CHAMPION OF TECHNOLOGY
AND IT FALLING INTO FOREIGN HANDS WILL BE SEEN AS VERY IN TESCO'S AND WHOEVER ITS OWNERSHIP IT STAYS OUTSIDE CAMBRIDGE WITH EMPLOYING PLENTY OF PEOPLE HERE THEIR COMMITMENT IS TO BASICALLY DOUBLE THE WORKFORCE THAT THEY HAVE THERE I THINK THIS AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST WITH TARTARE WHAT IT BROUGHT DRAG YOUR LANDROVER WHEN WE HAVE FOREIGN OWNERS WHO PUMPIN PLENTY OF MONEY AND ENHANCE THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY THAT EVERYONE THINKS THIS IS A JOLLY GOOD THING WE HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS PARTICULAR ONE GOES SAM AND JACK THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WELL IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN A POLICEMAN SHOT DEAD IN AN AMERICAN CITY THREE OF THEM THIS TIME IN BATON ROUGE IN LOUISIANA THE CITY WHEN A BLACK MAN WAS SHOT DEAD BY POLICE A FORTNIGHT AGO AND ONCE AGAIN ALONE BLACK GUNMAN WAS THE KILLER HE WAS SHOT DEAD BY THE POLICE AND ONCE AGAIN PRESIDENT OBAMA WENT ON TELEVISION MY FELLOW AMERICANS WE CAN PROVE
THROUGH WORDS AND THROUGH DEEDS THAT WE WILL NOT BE DIVIDED
WE'LL HAVE TO KEEP ON DOING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
THIS COUNTRY GETS UNITED THAT'S HOW WE BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER
ONLY WE CAN PROVE THAT WE HAD THE GRACE AND THE CHARACTER AND THE COMMON HUMANITY TO END THIS KIND OF SENSELESS VIOLENCE TO REDUCE
MISTRUST WITHIN THE AMERICAN FAIR I'D BE TALKING TO TARA WICCA WHO AS A DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THE BATON ROUGE CITY COUNCIL SPEAR SHARKING AND UNBELIEVABLE I THINK EVERYONE IS
STILL KIND OF IN THE STATE OR SHOUT TRYING TO A GRASPING IN SORT OF PUT OUR MINDS AND OUR HEARTS AROUND WAS ACTUALLY HAS A PARROT HERE WE NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS STARTED THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE EXPERIENCING
WHY NOT JUST BECAUSE WE WORKED SO HARD AREN'T AS A COMMUNITY WIND THE ANSWER'S STERLING SHOULD IT HAPPEN TO REALLY TRY TO DO THINGS OR DIFFERENT HERE IN OUR CITY OUR WHOLE ON FOCUS IN OURS REALLY MANY OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WAS JUST THAT WE WANTED THIS TO BE AN ATMOSPHERE OF PEACE GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOICED HER CONCERNS TO PROTEST
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WASN'T BEING DONE IN A VERY PEACEFUL WAY IN DO IT IN A WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW OUR SILLY TO HUGH OR WANT SORT OF ALL THE DUST AND EVERYTHING TRICIA BACK TO NORMAL THAT WOULD BE IN A BETTER PLACE WEREN'T YOU PERHAPS HALF EXPECTING SOMETHING
AWFUL TO HAPPEN AFTER THE KILLING OF A BLACK MAN BY POLICE AND SEEING WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES DAME I THINK THE THOUGHT WAS WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY THESE SOME SECOND WAVE ONCE THE VERDICT WOULD BE RELEASE IN TERMS OF WHITE HEAD WHATEVER CURD THERE
THE INDIVIDUALS MAKING THOSE DECISIONS BUT THIS SORT OF RIGHT ON THE HEELS OF THE FUNERAL AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT CROWD ARE COMPLETELY OFF GUARD SO WHAT IS GOING WRONG IN AMERICA
I THINK THAT THERE'S A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OR LACK OF COMPASSION EVERYONE AT THE END OF THE DAY WANTS THE SAME THING A GOOD DECENT QUALITY OF LIFE WITH THEIR FAMILY ARE ECONOMIC EQUALITY IN A COMMUNITY THAT THEY CAN FEEL SAFE HERE BUT IF A LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION FEELS THERE'S THIS EQUALITY DOESN'T EXIST THEN IT'S INEVITABLE THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE TROUBLE ISN'T IT
I AGREE I AGREE THE HOPE WAS ALWAYS THAT THERE WILL BE SOME RECOGNITION SON AREN'T FORWARD MOVE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE THINGS HAVE THE CHANGE IN THAT THEY COULD CHANGE PARCEL WITHOUT VIOLENCE AT THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE THERE THEY'RE INDIVIDUALS THERE BELIEVE THAT
VALANCES ARE IS A CATALYST FOR CHANGE IN YOU KNOW THIS BOY THAT SITTING DOWN ACROSS THE TABLE HERE IN EACH OTHER'S STORY HAVING A REASONABLE CONVERSATION GETS FACILITATED AND UNDERSTOOD COULD ASSHOLE BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF CHANGE IS JUST UNFORTUNATE EFFORT THAT THE VIOLENCE IS THERE USUALLY GUESS THE LOUDEST
AND THE FRIGHTENING THING IS THAT THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY BLACK PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR WHO WILL SAY THEY HAD IT COMING
YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THAT IN THERE IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE ESPECIALLY HERE YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE'S ALWAYS TWO OF THE OFFICERS WERE ASSHOLE AFRICAN AMERICAN IN IN TO SAY THE ONLY ONE DESERVES TO BE SHOT AND KILLED
FOR DOING THEIR JOB IS TO ME HE'S SO INHUMANE AND INSOLE WE'RE JUST WITH ABSOLUTELY NO COMPASSION YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND AND I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT SAY THERE ARE JUST AS BAD AS THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR HOUR HERE ARE COMMITTING THESE CRIMES THAT ARE PLAY IN THE SEA THESE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH INEQUALITY SO WHAT DOES AMERICA HAVE TO DO NOW
I THINK AMERICA HAS THAT LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SAY WHO ARE WE HOW WE DEFINE REDEFINE REDEFINING OURSELVES AS A COMMUNITY EFFIE THERE'S NO MORE HIDING BEHIND A GREAT COUNTRY WHICH WITH A GREAT COUNTRY BUT IT'S THE SAME WE ARE A COUNTRY WITH ISSUES IN HOLES IN THE SIDE OF WAY
BLOWING A BALLOON UP THERE HAS A HOLE IN A WEEK IN IT THIS COUNTRY IS A VERY DIVERSE COUNTRY WAS BUILT UPON THEIR BACKS OF OF NEARLY INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS IN THE SNOUT O.K. FOR ONE PART OF THE COMMUNITY TO BENEFIT IN THE THEATRE TO SUFFER AT THE EXPENSE OF ANOTHER CAR A WICKHAM MANY THANKS FOR TALKING TO US
# IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN SINCE THE REFERENDUM WE'VE HEARD FROM POLITICIANS AND A FEW BUSINESS LEADERS BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO CONTROL THE PURSE STRINGS OF CORPORATE BRITAIN
BACK TO BUSINESS NIGHT NEWS NOW WITH DOMINIC WHO IS HERE AGAIN HAVE A DOMINIC THANK YOU CYRIL I'M JOINED BY DAVID SPRULE WHO'S THE SENIOR PARTNER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE UPTON THE ACCOUNTANCY FIRM IT'S JUST PUBLISHED A SURVEY OF FINANCE TRICK IT'S A COVERS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE TO FINANCE THE FOOT IN THE FOOTSIE THREE FIFTY AND OTHER LARGE PRIVATE COMPANIES QUITE A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY IN THE SECOND QUARTER THREE QUARTERS OF FINANCE TRIGGERS SAID THERE WERE LESS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FINANCIAL PROSPECTS FOR THE COMPANY
HE WAS ONLY THIRTY TWO PER CENT IN THE PREVIOUS QUARTER THEY WERE THAT'S QUITE A BIT OR QUITE A BIG JUMP IN LISS CONFIDENCE IT'S ALL DOWN TO POST REFERENDUM BLUE'S ALWAYS OR SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON
I THINK HE'S MAINLY DUE TO THE POST REFERENDUM BLUES DOMINIC I MEAN CLEARLY CONFERENCE HAD BEEN SLIPPING IN THE PREVIOUS COUPLE OF QUARTERS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS THERE'S TWO POINTS I THINK JUMP OUT FROM AT THE FIRST AS YOU'VE GOT A RECOGNISED THIS WAS SURVEY WAS TAKEN AT THE POINT OF MAXIMUM UNCERTAINTY SHORTLY AFTER A REFERENDUM BEFORE WE HAD A PRIME MINISTER APPOINTED EXCESS
BUT THE SECOND THING IS IT IS A BIGGER DIP IN CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAD IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEHMAN'S BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SO THOSE TWO POINTS I THINK PUT A SORT OF GUIDE RAIL AROUND AROUND HAD TO INTERPRET THE POINT THAT WITH THE RELEVANCE OF THE SERVERS AT THE FINANCE FOR THE DIRECTORS OF THE PEOPLE WHO DECIDE TO SPEND OR NOT TO SPIN AND THAT IS THE BIG FEAR POST BRICKS IT IS AND PEOPLE JUST DOING NOTHING THAT IS AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE EURO CRISIS AND LEHMAN Z'S UNCERTAINTY
HE'S THE BIGGEST NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT NEGATIVE CONFIDENCE COMES THROUGH IN TERMS OF THEY LOWER APPETITE TO TAKE RISK ON THE BALANCE SHEET WHICH IN PRACTICAL TERMS MEAN LESS SPENDING LESS HIRING LESS CATTLE AND WHETHER IT'S IN THE SURVEY SURVEY OR ANECDOTALLY SHOULDN'T THERE BE FINANCE TRICKS THIS OUT THERE FROM EXPORTERS WHO SAY YIPPEE A WEEK A POUND LET'S GO TO TOWN
AND THERE ARE SO THIS ISN'T ALL ONE SIDE BUT IT GOES TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THEIR BUSINESS OVER THE MEDIUM TERM THIS DOESN'T SAY THEY'RE NOT AS CONFIDENT THEIR LONG TERM STRATEGY IT DOESN'T SAY THERE AREN'T STILL OPPORTUNITIES
AND WE'RE DOING THE SERVER GET OCTOBER MY EXPECTATION IS WE'D SEE SOME CONFIDENCE PICKING UP AT YOU'RE RIGHT THE CURRENCY IS A REAL ADVANTAGE IT IS THOUGH ISN'T IT IT'S A FINANCE DIRECTOR'S JOB TO BE A BIT HE OR IF SHE IN IT AND SAY WELL THINGS ARE A BIT GLUM
IT IS BUT EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THEY CAN ALSO BOUNCE BACK PRETTY QUICKLY AS CONFIDENCE COMES BACK SO YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK IN THESE SORT OF SURVEYS AND WE CAN'T DENY THE FACT THE FACTS ARE THE FACTS THAT AT THE MOMENT AT THE SERVICE TAKEN THERE'S A SORT OF AN OVER REACTION TO THE TO THE BAD NEWS
AS GOOD NEWS AND SAID STARTS COMING IN HOPEFULLY WILL SEE THAT REVERSING THERE CAN BE OTHER BUT OTHER SIDES TO WEAKER POINT CAN'T THEY'RE MISSING THIS MORNING AT A VERY BIG BID FROM JAPAN FOR ARM HOLDINGS ONE OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY CHAMPIONS TWENTY FOUR BILLION POUNDS WOULD YOU EXPECT TO SEE MORE THINGS LIKE THIS AS FOREIGN COMPANIES ENCOURAGED BY WE COULD COME SHOPPING FOR BARGAINS IN THE U.K.
I THINK WE WOULD BE SEEING QUITE A LOT OF COMMENT AROUND THE OP THE BUYING OPPORTUNITY I THINK IT TELLS US TWO THINGS ONE IS IT REMINDS US THAT WE HAVE SOME GREAT ASSETS HERE SOME GREAT BUSINESSES AND SOME GREAT SKILLS THAT REALLY UNDERPIN THE IF THE ECONOMY BUT BUT ABSOLUTELY I'D EXPECT TO SEE MORE BUYING BY FOREIGN INVESTORS INTO ASSETS IN THE U.K. WITH US WITH A LOT OF BAND THANK YOU MUCH THEY WOULD COUGH DELIGHT
# IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN ON THE WEST IS WATCHING EVENTS IN TURKEY WITH GREAT TREPIDATION AFTER THE FAILURE OF MILITARY COUP ON FRIDAY THE FEAR IS THAT PRESIDENT THE ONE WE'LL USE IT AS AN EXCUSE TO SEIZE EVEN MORE POWERFUL HIMSELF ALREADY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED INCLUDING HUGE NUMBER OF JUDGES AND EVERYONE HAS REFERRED TO THE CAUSE OF THE REVOLT AS A VIRUS THAT HE WILL ERADICATE COULD YOU WHAT REPORTS FROM ISTANBUL
WITH CALM NOW RESTORED MOSQUES ON SUNDAY PLAYED HOST TO FAMILIES BEARING THEIR LOVED ONES
THE DEATHS WERE POLITICAL THE GOODBYES
CROWD OF MOURNERS HAVE WALKED UP TO THE MOSQUE THEY'RE WAITING TO GO IN
THIS HEAVY SECURITY EVERYBODY'S BEING PATTED DOWN BEFORE THEY
THIS GRAFFITI NEEDS NO TO KING NO
ON THE SHORES OF THE BOSPHORUS YOU'D NEVER KNOW HOOD TAKING PLACE
THE BRIDGES LINKING ASIA TO EUROPE THAT WERE BLOCKED BY SOLDIERS ON FRIDAY NIGHT AN HOUR
THE FERRIES BELOW ARE RUNNING AND THE PEOPLE OF ISTANBUL ARE TRYING TO GET
RAMSAY IS ENJOYING A SPOT OF FISHING O.K.
WHO ISN'T HAPPY FOREVER WE HAVE WITNESSED TWO COUPS NINETEEN SIXTY AND NINETEEN EIGHTY
AND THE COUNTRY WENT BACK THIRTY YEARS EACH TIME THE WORST DEMOCRACY IS BETTER THAN THE BEST
WHILE THE REVOLT MAY HAVE SHOCKED PRESIDENT EARLY ONES RULE IT'S ALSO GIVEN HIM GROUNDS TO TIGHTEN HIS GRIP CLAMPING DOWN ON THOSE HE SAYS WERE CONNECTED TO THE REVOLT SIX THOUSAND ATTENTION SO FAR MANY EXPECT THAT TO RISE
HOW THE GOVERNMENT DEALS WITH THOSE WHO ARRESTED IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF TURKEY'S DEMOCRACY FOR THIS EPISODE SO REALLY BE TRUE TO ITS SPIRIT AS IT IS
CELEBRATED HERE THERE'S A DARNE OF DEMOCRACY AS A RENEWED UP OR TURKEY FOR TURKEY TO IMPROVE ITS EPIC STANDARDS THE DUE PROCESSES RELATING TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE SCHOOL WHERE TEN SHOULD BE VERY METICULOUSLY CHARIOT
WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT IS TO DISTINGUISH THAT THEY'RE REALLY BAD APPLES FROM THE AIR
IF THIS IS NOT DONE THEN THIS COULD EASILY TURN OUT TO BE SOMEBODY JUDGEMENTS AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSING THE
ON SUNDAY EVENING ANOTHER NIGHT OF VALLEYS CALLED FOR BY PRESIDENT EARLY WHEN HE'S ASKED PEOPLE TO MARK THEIR SUPPORT IN THE COMING DAYS WAVING FLAGS THE CROWD IT'S OVERWHELMINGLY PRO ADD ONE APART FROM A FEW
AS MAY IS ONE OF THOSE UNTIL THE THREAT IS OVER UNTIL WE GO BACK TO NORMAL WAY THINGS IT IS EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY
HE'LL BE ON THE STREETS IF EVERYONE'S COUNTRY EVERYONE'S PARLIAMENT OR A BUILDING THAT WAS BOMBED I CANNOT EMPHASISE THIS
I HAD A GO AT THE REFUSE THIS TO BE PULLED TO SIZE I THINK IT'S A NATIONAL ISSUE NOT A PORTABLE ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE A PART
IT'S THE TURKEY IS A DIVIDED COUNTRY THE RALLY'S STILL PROVE THAT POINT A BREAK IN THE CELEBRATIONS TO LISTEN TO THE VERSES OF THE KORAN
PRESIDENT ERRED ONE HE'S STILL GETTING HIS MOST LOYAL SUPPORT FROM THE COUNTRY'S CONSERVATIVE MUSLIM BASE BECAUSE ATTEMPTS MAY STRENGTHENED HIS GRIP ON POWER MIGHT NOT MAKE HIM ANY MORE UPON ANYTHING IN THE LONG RUN
# KATIE WATSON REPORTING THERE FROM ISTANBUL IT'S NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND IT'S TIME AGAIN FOR SOME JUICE AND HE'S BACK WITH US ALISON ALLIE HELLO AGAIN IT'S BEEN CALLED ONE OF THE GREATEST ROUNDS OF GOLF OF ALL TIME IT WAS CERTAINLY RECORDS HAVE PLENTY AT ROYAL TROON YESTERDAY'S HENRIK STENSON AND PHIL MICKELSON WENT TOE TO TOE IN THE FINAL ROUND OF THE OPEN WITH STENSON TRIUMPHING AND WINNING THE CLARET JUG LET'S SPEAK TO A GOLF CORRESPONDING IN CARTER MORNING IN
MORNING SO IT WAS A RECORD EQUALLING FINAL ROUND OF SIXTY THREE FOR STENTS IN HIS FIRST MAJOR WIN WHERE DOES THIS RATE IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF PLAY FOR YOU
I THINK IT RANKS RIGHT UP THERE HE SET A NEW RECORD FOR HER FOUR HOT FOR ROUND TOTAL AS FAR AS THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP IS CONCERNED THE LOWEST IN IN RELATION TO PARK NO ONE HAS BEEN TWENTY UNDER PAR
BEFORE AN OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP TO WIN SO STATISTICALLY IT'S RIGHT UP THERE BUT SIMPLY THE QUALITY OF THE GOLF THE RELENTLESS NATURE OF BIRDY AFTER BIRDIE AFTER BIRDIE I REALLY WAS EXTRAORDINARY AS BOTH PLAYERS REALLY PUSH THEMSELVES ON THEY SEPARATED THEMSELVES FROM THE REST
TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE WE OFTEN REMEMBER NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN IN THE JEWEL IN THE SUN WHEN TOM WATSON BE JACK NICHOLAS THIS WAS VERY VERY SIMILAR OH KAY HENRIK STENSON ISN'T OF THE LEGENDARY STATUS OF THOSE TWO BUT NICHOLSON IS CERTAINLY UP THERE AND IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY MICK STENSON ONE AT TWENTY UNDER PAR
PLAY IT FINISHED BY THREE SHOTS IN THE PLAY FINISHED THIRD WAS FOURTEEN SHOTS BEHIND HIM AND THE TWO PLAYERS REALLY BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN EACH OTHER IT MUST BE A TOUGH LOSS FOR PHIL MICKELSON TISSUED SIXTY FIVE AND STILL LOSE BY THREE SHOTS
VERY MUCH SO AND HIS TOTAL OF TWO SIX SEVEN FOR THE FOUR SHOTS WOULD HAVE EQUALLED THE LOWEST SEVENTY TWO HOLE TOTAL IN THE FOOT ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE YEAR HISTORY OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP SO THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA
FOR QUALITY OF GOLF THAT NICHOLSON PLAYED AND YET IT STILL WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN INDEED IT WAS ONLY GOOD ENOUGH FOR A FURTHER THREE SHOT DEFEAT MICKELSON IS FORTY SIX YEARS OF AGE YOU WONDER HOW MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO WIN THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIPS PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU PLAY AS WELL AS THAT THAT AND STILL CAN'T GET THE JOB DONE DO YOU THINK GOLF NEEDED A DAY LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY AFTER ALL THE CRITICISM OF THOSE OLYMPIC WITHDRAW
I THINK SO SIR NO I THINK THAT GOLF DESPERATELY NEEDED SOMETHING AS EXCITING AS THIS IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE PRIVILEGE TO BE INSIDE THE ROPES WALKING WITH THE GROUPS THE STAMP AID OF SUPPORTERS BETWEEN EACH HOLE WAS WAS LIKE SOMETHING FROM FROM DAYS GONE BY I CAN'T REMEMBER SCENES QUITE LIKE IT IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS JOB OVER A DECADE AND A HALF
IT WAS A DAY TO REALLY CAPTURE THE IMAGINATION I SUPPOSE FROM GOLF'S POINT OF VIEW THERE WILL BE A DEGREE OF DISAPPOINTMENT THAT A BIGGER TELEVISION AUDIENCE DIDN'T SEE IT BECAUSE OF COURSE THIS WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT IT HAS GONE FROM TERRESTRIAL TELEVISION
ON THE B. B. C. FOR LIVE COVERAGE BUT EVEN SO IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY DAY FOR GOLF AND IT DID NEED THAT AFTER ALL THE BAD PUBLICITY IAN CARTER THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS MORNING ENGLAND'S CRICKETERS HAVE LOST THE OPENING TEST OF THE SERIES AGAINST PAKISTAN CHASING TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE TO WIN ON THE FOURTH DAY AT LORD'S THE HOME SIDE WERE UNDONE BY SOME INSPIRED PAKISTANI BOWLING WITH TOURISTS WINNING BY SEVENTY FIVE

# IT IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT M.P.S WILL VOTE TODAY TO KEEP THE TRIDENT NUCLEAR MISSILE SYSTEM THERE'S NOT MUCH DOUBT ABOUT THAT THERE IS SOME DOUBT AS TO HOW MANY LABOUR M.P.S WILL JOIN IN THAT BOAT AND EFFECTIVELY DEFY THE LEADERSHIP OF JEREMY CORBIN HE'S ALWAYS BEEN OPPOSED TO TRIDENT BUT HE'S BEEN FORCED TO ALLOW HIS M.P.S HAVE A FREE VOTE TO MANY WILL VOTE TO BUILD A NEW GENERATION OF SUBMARINES ONE OF THEM IS JOHN WOODCOCK HE TOLD RADIO FOUR'S WESTMINSTER WHY
THERE HAS BEEN NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AT ALL IN THE FACTORS WHICH HAS LED THE LABOUR PARTY FUN
MANY YEARS NOW TO BE IN SUPPORT OF MAINTAINING THE DETERRENT WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TO INVOKE NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL UPON THE UNITED KINGDOM MANY LABOUR M.P.S SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST SO CALLED FREE VOTES WITH SERIO END AND IT IT IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS A FREE ABOUT ON SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL MATTER OF NO NATIONAL SECURITY EXCEPT TO SAY THE BLUSHES OF THEIR LEADER WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE LABOUR PARTY'S ESTABLISHED POLICIES
WELL LET'S SEE WHETHER THE SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY BELIEVES IN THEM SHE IS EMILY THORNBERRY SHE WAS THE SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JOHN AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE AT ALL TO DO YOU'RE GOING TO ABSTAIN WHY I'M GOING TO ABSTAIN BECAUSE FRANKLY THEY TORY GOVERNMENT OR PLAYING GAMES WITH US AS YOU SAY YOURSELF IN YOUR IN YOUR PROGRAMME THIS IS A VOTE THAT ISN'T NEEDED AND I DIDN'T SAY THAT HIT HIM WITH RESPECT I DIDN'T SAY THAT
WHILE THE HEADLINE THAT I WAS LISTENING TO THIS MORNING YOU WERE SAYING THIS AS IT WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES THE GOVERNMENT IS PROCEEDING WITH IT IN ANY EVENT AND THEY THEY ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT ME AND HAD A MAIN GATE VOTE BUT THEY'VE NOW DECIDED THEY DON'T NEED A MAIN GATE VOTES SO THIS VOTE IN THE LAST WEEK PARLIAMENT IS ALL ABOUT PLAYING GAMES WITH THE LABOUR PARTY AND TRYING TO
YOU EMBARRASS US AND WELL AND I CAN SEE NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD INDULGE IN IT WELL ON THAT POINT WHAT WHY WE SHOULD INDULGE IN IT WE HAVEN'T HAD A VOTE ON TRIDENT FOR VERY NEARLY TEN YEARS AND THAT WAS ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF WHERE THOSE WE KEEP IT OR NOT THIS IS MORE DETAILED AND SURELY PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO KNOW HER MAJESTY'S OPPOSITION WHAT'S HER MAJESTY'S OPPOSITION POSITION IS
HER MAJESTY'S OPPOSITION OUGHT TO BE HOLDING THE GOVERNMENT TO ACCOUNT AND WHEN YOU SAY THIS ISN'T A DETAILED IT ABSOLUTELY ISN'T MULTI NATURALISM IN THIS MOTION IS FRANKLY AN ABSOLUTE AFTERTHOUGHT AND IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO RETAIN ANY TO UP CAPABILITY WE OUGHT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT MULTILATERAL ISN'T RIGHT SO WHAT IS YOUR POSITION I AM LET ME WEAR IT AND THE SECOND POINT IS
THAT IN THIS THIS IS NOT DETAILED IN THAT IT DOES NOT GO INTO THE COSTS YOU KNOW ANY OTHER DECISION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD WANT TO MAKE ON THIS THE SINGLE BIGGEST INVESTMENT BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO MAKE THEY WERE YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO GO INTO SOME DETAILS ON COS NOW THEY SAY THAT IT'LL COST THIRTY ONE BILLION PLUS TEN BILLION OR TO REBUILD THE SUBS
BUT THEY WON'T TELL US ABOUT HOW MUCH INFRASTRUCTURE WILL COST IT WHERE THEY WON'T TELL US HOW MUCH THE MAINTENANCE WILL COST NOR THE LOT NOR THE WARHEAD NOR THE LIFETIME COSTS SO THEREFORE YOUR OPPOSITION SUCH AND SO WHEN WE ASKED THE GOVERNMENT HOW MUCH IT WAS GOING TO COST THE GOVERNMENT SAID ISN'T IT THE GOVERNMENT SAID THEY NEEDED A SAFE SPACE
TO CONSIDER THEIR OPTIONS AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC GAZE UNFETTERED FROM COMMENTS ABOUT AFFORDABILITY NOW YOU TELL ME JOHN IS THAT A DETAILED PROPOSAL NO IT'S NOT RIGHT AND THEREFORE ON THE BASIS OF THAT WHAT IS YOUR POSITION YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO ABSTAIN AT THE VOTE SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES WILL WE JUST HEARD FROM ONE OF THEM WILL VOTE FOR KEEPING TRIDENT OTHERS WILL VOTE AGAINST INCLUDING YOUR LEADER WHAT IS YOUR POSITION YOU'RE THE FOREIGN SECRETARY YOU WILL THE DEFENCE SECRETARY
THE LABOUR PARTY'S POSITION IS THAT WE ARE HAVING A REVIEW AND WE ARE LOOKING SENSIBLY AND IN A GROWN UP WAY AT ALL THE OPTIONS THE OPTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN CONSIDERED PROPERLY IN OUR VIEW AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE LEADING JEREMY CORBIN IS GOING TO VOTE AGAINST SO HE WASN'T WHAT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE POINT OF HAVING A REVIEW IS WHEN YOUR LEADER HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO VOTE AGAINST AN EVEN IF TRIDENT IS RENEWED AND EVEN IF HE BECOMES PRIME MINISTER
AND THERE IS A TRIDENT NUCLEAR WEAPONS SYSTEM IN IN ACTION HE WOULD NOT PRESS THE BUTTON
JEREMY IS GOING TO CAMPAIGN AND ALWAYS WILL CAMPAIGN FOR UNILATERAL MULTIPLE AND WEEP THAT UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT THAT YOU KNOW THAT HE'S ALWAYS BEEN HIS POSITION BUT THE LABOUR PARTY THE LABOUR PARTY HAS TO COME TO A COLLECTIVE DECISION AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT BY WAY OF COLLECTING EVIDENCE AND CONSIDERING IT IN A PROPER WAY AND AS AS AS I WAS SAYING
WE HAVE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO'VE YOU CONTRIBUTED TO MY REVIEW WE HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF HOUSES AND WE YES THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED HE'S BEEN QUITE EXTRAORDINARY SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO GET THE RESULT I DIDN'T
WE WERE GOING TO GET IT THE WEEK AFTER BRECHT'S IT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT BRECHT'S IT HAPPENED AND THAT HAS AN EFFECT ON ALL OF THE COUNTRY'S MONEY WE HAVE TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHETHER YOU KNOW THIS IF IT PLEASE JUST HAVE A LOOK AT IT
WELL IT'S CERTAINLY SIR DO YOU KNOW WHAT MONEY IS IMPORTANT YET MONEY IS IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY AT A TIME OF FINANCIAL STRESS RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE LESS LIKELY THEREFORE THAT YOU WOULD SUPPORT IT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU CALL FINANCIAL STRESS OTHER WAS AS A RESULT OF BRECHT'S IT IT IS LESS LIKELY THAT THE LABOUR PARTY WILL BE IN FAVOUR OF RENEWING TRIDENT IS THAT WHAT YOU SAY
NO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THERE ARE A RANGE OF OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THEY SHOULD BE LOOKED AT CAREFULLY IN IT FOR US AT A TIME LIKE THIS TO BE GOING FOR THE MOST EXPENSE DEFENSIVE ALL OF ALL THE OPTIONS IS IN MY VIEW RECKLESS THERESA MAY TALKS ABOUT IT BEING RECKLESS FOR US NOT TO VOTE TODAY I THINK THAT IT IS RECKLESS TO PLOUGH ON AHEAD WITH THE MOST EXPENSIVE OF ALL THE VARIOUS OPTIONS AND THERE ARE STEP DOWNS THAT WE CAN TAKE
I THINK THAT IT IS ALSO ABSOLUTELY AT THE HEART OF THE LABOUR PARTY PHILOSOPHY THAT WE SUPPORT MULTILATERAL ISM IT'S TRADITION THAT GOES BACK TO NYE BEVAN THROUGH HAROLD WILSON AND MARGARET BECKETT AND THIS GOVERNMENT IS MAKING NO EFFORT ON THE MULTILATERAL FRONT AT ALL NOT A LATERAL TALKS HAVE ABSOLUTELY GROUND INTO THE GROUND WE'VE COME TO A HALT AND THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT THAT TO EMILY THORNBERRY MANY THANKS
# IT'S NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THEY COME TO STRIKINGLY SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE FAILED COUP IN TURKEY THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE COUNTRY HAS AT LONG LAST TAMED ITS ARMY BUT IN SO DOING HAS UNLEASHED A VIOLENT MOB THE DAILY MAIL SALUTES THOSE WHO BRAVELY DEFENDED THEIR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT BIG CONDEMNS WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS
BARBARIC SCENES OF REVENGE IT SHOWS WHAT IT CALLS DISTURBING IMAGES OF SOLDIERS HALF NAKED AND BOUND WHILE IT'S CORRESPONDENT IN ISTANBUL REPORTS THAT A SOLDIER WAS BEHEADED ON THE BRIDGE OVER THE BOSPHORUS
LET'S HOPE FOR THE SAKE OF THIS WONDERFUL WONDERFUL COUNTRY SAYS THAT PRESIDENT WHEN'S BRUTAL REPRESSION DOES NOT TRIGGER AN EVEN GREATER CRISIS THE FINANCIAL TIMES SAYS THE BACK STORY TO THE ATTEMPTED COUP IS MY ONE SEE SAWING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ARMED FORCES AS PRIME MINISTER HE DE FANGED CULLING THE TOP BRASS BUT IT SAYS DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS AS PRESIDENT HE HAS PLAYED THE NATIONALIST CARD AND RELAUNCHED ALL OUT WAR AGAINST KURDISH DISSIDENTS BRING IN THE GENERAL'S BACK INSIDE THE CIRCLE OF POWER
THE TELEGRAPH TRIES TO WORK OUT WHY THE COUP FAILED IT SAYS PLANS WERE WELL LAID BUT HAD TO BE RUSHED INTO EXECUTION WEMBLEY PUTSCH ISTS HEARD THE GOVERNMENT WAS ABOUT TO ISSUE ARREST WARRANTS FOR SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF SUPPORTING THE EXILED CLERIC THAT YOUR LOGO
# THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE RESPONSE IN FRANCE TO THE LORRY ATTACK IN NICE HAS BEEN MARKEDLY DIFFERENT TO THAT AFTER THE PARACHUTING SHOOTINGS LAST NOVEMBER THIS TIME IT SAYS THE ANGER AND ACCUSATIONS BETWEEN OPPOSING POLITICIANS HAS BEGUN EVEN BEFORE THE FAMILIES HAVE HAD TIME TO BURY THEIR DEAD IT CREATES A LOCAL NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST SAYING IT MAY BE TIME FOR COMPASSION AND MORNING BUT IT'S ALSO A TIME FOR QUESTIONING POLITICAL LEADERSHIP THE MAIL SAYS THE KILLER MOHAMMED BULLER WAS ON A COCKTAIL OF DRUGS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA ALCOHOLISM AND DEPRESSION
# THE PAPER SAYS IT'S VISITED HIS FATHER AND SEEN A RECORD OF HIS PRESCRIPTIONS THAT POINT TO A DISTURBED MENTAL STATE THE TIMES USES FOUR PAGES AND A LEADING ARTICLE TO REPORT ON THE VOTE TO RUN NEW BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM IT SAYS THE CLOCK ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF IMMINENT NUCLEAR CONFLICT STILL STANDS AT THREE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT HE'D URGES M.P.S TO BACK THE PROCUREMENT MOTION IN THE COMMONS TODAY TO GIVE REASSURANCE TO BRITAIN'S ALLIES THAT WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT UPHOLDING A ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER
GREEN M.P. CAROLINE LUCAS REHEARSES HER ARGUMENTS IN THE EYE NEWSPAPERS SHE SAYS THESE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE DEATH ON AN UNIMAGINABLE SCALE AND DO NOTHING TO HINDER THE REAL THREAT OF LONE GUNMAN OR EXTREMISTS
# THE TIME IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT REPUBLICANS ARE GATHERING IN CLEVELAND OHIO TO NOMINATE DOMINANT DONALD TRUMP AS THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HE'S ALMOST THERE THE MAN WHO ME YEAR AGO EVERYONE WAS WRITING OFFERS AN OVERBLOWN SELF PUBLICIST SO WHERE HAS HE FOUND HIS DETERMINATION GYMNOPEDIES BEEN FINDING OUT ON THE ROAD PARTICULARLY
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WHEN COUNTRIES NEED REVOLUTION NOW NOBODY WANTS TO SEE KNIVES AND PITCHFORKS AND GUNS ON THE STREET BUT
WE NEED A POLITICAL REVOLUTION
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IS A REVELATION THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE CRYING OUT FOR IT
BERNARD SCHIFFER EIGHTY ONE SERENADING DONALD TRUMP WITH HIS OWN SONG AND THE REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN IN YOUNGSTOWN OHIO TALKING OF REVOLUTION
ANGER AND EXCITEMENT BUT TRUMP BLEND AND HERE IN AMERICA'S RUST BELT WITH A STEEL MILLS WERE ONCE A CAULDRON OF PROSPERITY THAT ANGLE IS BOILING ALL AROUND YOU YOU CAN SEE WHY
THIS DOWN HERE STRUTHERS WANTS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THE RESTORERS ON BOTH SIDES THERE WERE TWO DEPARTMENTS GENERAL DICKIE RETIRED STEELWORKER AND UNION NEGOTIATOR GRANDSON OF IMMIGRANTS CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THERE WERE JOBS JOBS
JOBS THEREFORE FATHER HE WORKED TO THE RADIANCE IN THIS BUILDING ON THE ROAD WITH A BROKEN
WE'RE STANDING NOW ON A PIECE OF GROUND THAT WAS A RICH INDUSTRIAL LANDSCAPE WHICH TREES AND SHRUBS AND WILD FLOWERS AND NOW ENCROACHING BUT YOU CAN SEE THE SIGNS OF THE PAST ALL AROUND US AN OLD RAILWAY TRACK THE BED OF IT THEY'RE ON RAISED STONE
NO BROKEN INTO AN OLD RAILWAY TRAIN ITSELF LIES THERE RUSTING AND BEHIND US THE HULKS OF OLD STEEL MILLS WHAT WAS THIS LIKE IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE SEVENTIES WHEN IT WAS THUNDERING AWAY WHAT WOULD WE HAVE SEEN
A BEEHIVE OF ACTIVITY THERE WAS PLAYERS FURNACES HERE THEY WERE CALLED PLANTS HERE THERE WAS ALWAYS MACHINE OR REMOVING IT WAS STEEL ON STEEL THE SIRENS WERE ALWAYS BLARING YOU COULD HEAR THE SIRENS AT NIGHT AND THE DAY CAME
WHEN YOU KNEW THAT IT WAS GOING TO END
IT WAS SEPTEMBER NINETEENTH NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WE WERE TOLD THAT THE COMPANY WOULD CLOSE THE ENTIRE CAMPBELL WORKS THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON OUR LIVES OUR LIVELIHOOD OUR FUTURE OUR FAMILIES OUR COMMUNITY THE AMERICAN DREAM BECAME HARDER AND HARDER TO ACHIEVE THOSE THAT STAY THEY FOUND THAT THE PAY CHEQUE DIDN'T AMOUNT TO THE SAME AS THE FACTORY WORK AS THE MILL JOBS THE LIFE BECAME HARDER AND HARDER
THESE ARE THE TANKS AND BOMBS HAD WORN
THE CAR IN
THE BALLADEER OF URBAN AMERICA BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN WITH HIS MOURNFUL ANTHEM TO THIS PLACE BECAUSE THE PAIN ISN'T AN INVENTION OF DONALD TRUMP IT'S FELT BY THOSE WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF GETTING THEM A VOTE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS A PILLAR OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY POLITICS SINCE THE DEPRESSION OF THE THIRTIES AND F.D.R.'S NEW DEAL
THE QUESTION ON WHICH THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION MAY TURN IS WHETHER MANY OF THEM MIGHT NOW TON TRUMPS WAY
ON THE NIGHT OF THE PRIMARY HERE THE REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN MARK MONRO WATCHED SOMETHING HE'D NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE
THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS HOW MANY REPUBLICANS VOTED AT THE PRIMARY ELECTION IT WAS THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND AND I FROZE
I FELL OFF MY CHAIR THERE WERE ONLY FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND REPUBLICANS
STANDING AT ANOTHER SITE WHERE THE MILLS HAVE BEEN PULLED DOWN HOOSIER ROYAL OF THE UNITED STEEL WORKERS' UNION CONFIRMS IT HE'S WORRIED
WHAT WE FEEL IS THAT MISTER TRUMP IS ACTUALLY PREYING UPON THE FEARS AND THE ANGLE OF THE CONTRACTION OF THE STILL ENTREES WATCHING PEOPLE'S JOBS GO OVERSEAS THE CLOSURE OF PLANTS
IF THEY HEAR SOMEONE SAYING I'M WILLING TO HAVE A TRADE WAR WITH CHINA THEY SAY ABOUT TIME TOO
EXACTLY THEY LIKE THAT KIND OF RHETORIC A JOB NOW WAS TO EDUCATE BECAUSE RHETORIC IS RHETORIC AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF SUBSTANCE TO WHAT YOU SAID
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS UNORTHODOX HE TALKS ABOUT HIMSELF ALL THE TIME OFFENDS SOMEBODY IN NEARLY EVERY SPEECH AND USES LANGUAGE WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE MODERN ERA CLINTON ISN'T JUST WRONG HE SAYS BUT CORRUPT AND A CROOK
IT'S AS IF A POTENT DRUG HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO THE BLOODSTREAM OF THE CAMPAIGN WE HAVE TO GET OUR ENERGY BACK MY GRANDPARENTS CAME FROM EUROPE BUT THEY ALL CAME FROM BOULOGNE BECOME THE RIGHT WAY WHAT'S THE BIG ISSUE FOR YOU THE SAFETY OF OUR COUNTRY
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I THINK WE NEED TO THROW OUT SOME PEOPLE THEIR DUMP HER LONG HAIR WHO
THE WEEK OF US THAT'S THE SPIRIT AMONG THESE REPUBLICANS WAITING TO HEAR HIS RUNNING MATE AN AXE
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE A MAN WHO I TRULY
BELIEVE WILL BE OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY AND WILL BE THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT GOES BECKY THANK YOU
WHY ARE YOU SPORTING TRUMP HE'S REAL GOOD WITH ECONOMICS I ALSO THINK HE'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY IS FOREST SECURITY WE NEED AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDE AGGRESSOR FOR SUCCESS AND IN MAKING THIS COUNTRY GREAT
HE'S JUST THE RIGHT MAN AT THIS TIME AND OUR LIVES EVERYONE I KNOW AS FED UP WITH GOVERNMENT THEY'RE FED UP WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING AND IF WE DON'T MAKE A CHANGE WE WILL NOT HAVE A COUNTRY HIS PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT MANY REPUBLICANS FIND THEM UNPALATABLE MANY IDEOLOGICAL CONSERVATIVES ARE WEARY WHICH IS WHY AT THE WEEKEND HE CHOSE THE ULTRA CONSERVATIVE GOVERNOR PETS TO RUN WITH IT
NO MAD MAHDI MAN NO WINE THE NEXT TIME WE BOAT SENT A MESSAGE TO THE OTHERS YOU DON'T FLOAT MY BOAT
THIS IS AN ELECTION INFLUX DRIVEN BY ANGER RIVEN BY UNCERTAINTY THE BIGGEST UNKNOWN OF ALL STILL BEING DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF
AT THE CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND STARTING TODAY EVEN THE SOLDIERS IN HIS OWN ARMY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT
YOU HAVE IT FOLKS
VOTE FOR PRESIDENT YEAH
# THAT WAS JIM REPORTING WE SHALL BE HEARING MUCH MORE OF HIM IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF THERE ISN'T IS NOW AT ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY UM WITH US THIS MORNING IS DOCTOR JANE LEACH THE PRINCIPLE OF WESLEY HOW'S THE METHODIST COLLEGE IN CAMBRIDGE WE WANT TO GET IN YOUR MORNING JOHN
MOMENTOUS EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS SEEM TO HAVE RAIN SO THICK AND FAST BUT IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP
WHILST THE AFTERSHOCKS OF THE REFERENDUM AND ITS CONSEQUENCES HAVE YET TO BE ABSORBED AT HOME NEWS FROM AROUND THE WORLD FROM BAGHDAD FROM ORLANDO FROM DALLAS FROM NEATH FROM TURKEY FROM BATON ROUGE RAISES FURTHER QUESTIONS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TAKEN FOR GRANTED US OF THINGS
SUDDENLY THOSE OF US WHO LIVE MOST OF OUR LIVES IN RELATIVE PEACE TIME AND A RELATIVELY STABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE MADE AWARE THAT THINGS CHANGE BUT NOTHING LASTS FOREVER EVEN THAT CIVILISATIONS CAN FALL
NOT PERHAPS QUITE THERE BUT WHEN EVENT SEEM SO RANDOM AND SO BRUTAL AND PRESSING WHERE DO WE TURN FOR SOME STILLNESS IN WHICH WE CAN PAUSE AND THINK AND DISCERN HOW TO ACT ONE OF THE PLACES TO WHICH I AND I'M TEMPTED TO PANIC IS POETRY AND PART OF WHAT THE BEST OF IT CAN DELIVER IS THE NAMING AND CONTAINMENT OF THE VULNERABLE SENSE OF HOW SMALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE IN THE FACE OF EVENTS
T.S. ELIOT IN EAST COKER ECHOING THE BOOK OF ECCLESIASTES WRITES ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH HOUSES ARE BUILT AND ARE DESTROYED AND I REPLACED OR RETURNED TO OPEN FIELDS
ELLIOT SETTING IS DOMESTIC AND IT IS WRITING ABOUT THE IMPERMANENCE OF EVERYTHING AND HOW IN THE FACE OF THE CRUMBLING OF WHAT WE KNOW KNOWLEDGE ACQUIRED TO EXPERIENCE SEEMS WEAK OR EVEN USELESS AND HOW EVERY MOMENT REQUIRES A NEW AND SHOCKING EVALUATION OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN
IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN OUR VALUES ARE IN QUESTION AND OUR WAY OF LIFE SEEMED UNDER THREAT AND OUR RESPONSES SEEM INADEQUATE THERE ARE PERHAPS ONLY THREE OPTIONS TO FLEE TO BLUSTER OR DIGGING DEEPER
FOR ME THE GOING DEEPER IS FACILITATED BY POETRY FOR ELLIOT IT HAPPENS THROUGH CHRISTIAN RITUAL AND WHAT RITUAL DOES FOR US IS TO MAKE AS TO BE STILL AND TO KNOW HE'S ELLIOT PUTS IT THAT THE ONLY WISDOM WE CAN HOPE TO ACQUIRE IS THE WISDOM OF HUMILITY
THE WISDOM THAT COMES FROM KNOWING OURSELVES TO BE SMALL AND YET UNAFRAID BECAUSE WE ARE HELD AND LOVED
IN THE POEM CALLED DEFERRED NICHT DISH DERMIS BOOKED TRANSLATED BY ANITA BURROWS AND JOANNA MAY SEE MANY MORAY REAL COLOUR PUTS IT LIKE THIS BE EARTH NOW AND EVEN SONG WITH A GRAND LYING UNDER THAT SKY
BE MODEST NOW LIKE A THING RIPENED UNTIL IT IS REAL SO THAT HE WHO BEGAN AT ALL CAN FEEL YOU WHEN HE REACHES FOR YOU
PERHAPS THIS RETREAT INTO POETRY OR RITUAL SEEMS TO QUIETEST TOO PASSIVE WHEN THERE'S MUCH TO RAGE ABOUT A MUCH TO DECIDE AND MUCH THAT NEEDS FIXING
ELLIOT AND REAL KARA BOTH DRAWING ON AN ANCIENT BIBLICAL WISDOM THAT IT'S THE STILL SMALL PLACE FROM WHICH TRUE ACTION SPRINGS ACTION THAT IS NOT DRIVEN BY FEAR OR EGO BUT BY SOBER TRUTH AND BY LOVE
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH DOCTOR JANE LEACH THE TIME HE WAS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT WORLD LEADERS HAVE WORN TURKEYS PRESIDENT ADD A WOMAN NOT TO USE THE FAILED COUP WAS A CHANCE TO CRUSH ALL DISSENT
SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED SINCE SATURDAY MORNING ALMOST HALF FROM THE JUDICIARY AND THE PRESIDENT HAS SUGGESTED REINTRODUCING THE DEATH PENALTY HE'S BEEN CRITICISED FOR YEARS FOR HIS INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN STYLE ZEB JANE CANDOUR IS IN HIS JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY AND ASKED IF SHE UNDERSTOOD WHY PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT HE WOULD DO
ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST WITH YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS CONCERN I AM SO WHY CONCERN HAS BEEN EXPRESSED THE TURKISH PEOPLE HAVE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS THAT
HOW IMPORTANT THEIR DEMOCRACY IS TOM HOW IMPORTANT THEY WERE KIND OF SYSTEM AND TO REDUCE THIS DOWN TO PRESENT OUR THE ONE HE'S GOING TO MAKE GREATER USE OF POWER AND ABUSE THE PEOPLE EVEN MORE IS ACTUALLY INSULTING TO THE TURKISH PEOPLE AN ORIENTALIST APPROACH THAT IS OUTDATED AND SHOULD BE
BRITISH DEMOCRACY IS UNDERGOING TESTS AT THE MOMENT AND IN THE FIRST TWENTY FIRST FIFTEEN HOURS OF THAT PEST THEY PROVE THAT
DEMOCRACY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO THEM THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO DIE FOR IT EVERYONE HAS AS MUCH POWER AS THE PEOPLE GIVE HIM AT THE MOMENT THE CONSTITUTION THAT IS IN PLACE WHICH WAS INTRODUCED BY A MILITARY JUNTA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY IS
A COMPETITION IT GIVES THE PRESIDENT HUNG LIMITED POWER
THERE IS A NEED FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION ALL POLITICAL PARTIES ARE AGREED ON THIS THE TURKISH PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER'S FEELS THIS TIME FOR THE WORST RESPECTED THE TURKISH PEOPLE INDEED AND YOU'RE NO THAT FOREIGN LEADERS WERE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE COUP AND THE CRITICISM IT'S A BIT LATE THERE THERE OPPOSITION CAME IN THE MORNING WHEN THE COUP HAD BEEN DEFEATED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE POSITIVE FOR THE TURKISH PEOPLE IF THEY'D THE MISSION ARRIVED MUCH MUCH QUICKER DO YOU THINK THOUGH THAT I MEAN YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS A CRITICISM THE TURKISH PEOPLE THE FIERCE SURELY IS NOT ABOUT WHAT TURKISH PEOPLE WANT BUT IT'S WHAT HOW PRESIDENT ONE MIGHT USE THIS I DON'T THINK WHAT CAPONE PARTY GOVERNMENT OR PRESIDENT AND ONE WANTED ANYTHING
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE TURKISH PEOPLE WANT TO WEAR THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT RICK WE INTRODUCE OUR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND HIS ACTUAL QUOTE IS
THIS WILL I ASSUME THAT THIS WILL BE DISCUSSED IN PARLIAMENT BY ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES HE'S A PARLIAMENT WILL DISCUSS THIS THIS IS DEMOCRACY AT WORK AND THE WEST NEWS TO STOP RECEIVING IT IN A WAY THAT
ACTUALLY MARK ACCURATE ANYONE BUT THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN THE PAST NOT LEAST TIGHTENING CONTROLS IN THE MEDIA AND WE'VE SEEN ALREADY MOVED TO I JUST INTERRUPT YOU AGAIN
YEP PEOPLE WHO WERE PUT ON TRIAL FOR HER JOURNALISM WE'RE NOT PUT ON TRIAL THE PRESIDENT'S ORDERS THEY'RE PUT ON TRIAL AT THE PROSECUTOR'S PUBLIC PROSECUTORS ORDERS THE PRESIDENT HAS IN FACT HIDING MANY MANY OF THE PEOPLE THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S PUT ON TRIAL BUT WE DO KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LAST
SINCE FRIDAY NEARLY THREE THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS HAVE BEEN EITHER SUSPENDED HAVE BEEN ARRESTED MANY SUSPENDED
PEOPLE WILL BE UNDERSTANDABLY FEARFUL THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING IS CRUSHING ANY FORM OF DISSENT OH KAY ONCE AGAIN THE PRESIDENT'S NOT DOING AS THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING PLEASE STOP PRODUCING AND WE HAVE DOESN'T TURKEY TO PRESENT AND ONE WAS THERE'S A GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNMENT IS IN PLACE THE GOVERNMENT IS FUNCTIONING AS IT PROVED
AND FRIDAY NIGHT SO I CAN'T CHECK WHAT DO YOU DO YOU BELIEVE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE EFFECT OF THIS CLUE WILL BE TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY IN THE TURKEY RATHER THAN THE REVERSE WHICH MANY FEAR INDISPUTABLY YES WITHOUT ANY MESSING YES IF THE PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO FUNCTION TOGETHER AND TO WORK TOGETHER AND PULL TOGETHER AS THEY HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER NINETY YEARS
DEMOCRACY HAS WON THE TURKISH PEOPLE HAT WILL HAVE ONE
JANE CANDOUR TALKING TO BE JUST A LITTLE EARLIER WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW BY SEVE GIE A COSH CHEST ME WHO WAS EDITOR IN CHIEF OF A NEWSPAPER TODAY'S A MAN IT WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE GOVERNMENT IN MARCH AS PART OF A MEDIA CRACKDOWN THEN HELLO TO YOU HI NEWT YOU HEARD WHAT WAS SAID THERE THAT THIS IS THE PRESIDENT JUST RESPONDING TO A DEMOCRACY IT'S HIS GOVERNMENT IT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT
I'VE GOT I CANNOT BE MORE I MEAN ALL THE ACTIONS OF THE PRESENT GO ON AHEAD BE SIGNALLING INCREASING TO ATTAIN IF NOT BEST FOR DEGREES HERE IN TURKEY AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS DESPICABLE ARE TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FAILED QUIRK IS JUST GOING TO GIVE OUR DON IN ANOTHER PROTECTS TO CONSUL OF THEY'D HIS DICTATORSHIP
IS IT ALL IN THE STEAD AND THE DEBT THE ATTENTION OF OUR JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS END AND JOURNALISTS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN THE GUN I EVEN THINK HE'S FOLLOWING UP ALL THE HOURS AFTER
AND THE FAILED HOW COULD YOU BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE PURGED STARRED PERIGEE
ARE THE MEMBERS OF DID YOU DO THIS IS A BIT OF BRIGHTENING THERE HIS PREVIOUS PROFILING OF JUDICIARY MEMBERS AND THIS IS JUST GOING TO GIVE HER AN EXCUSE TO OUR CLEANING UP THE REMAINING IN TURKEY BUT YOU HEARD THE ARGUMENT THERE FROM JANE CANDOUR THAT ACTUALLY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S IT WAS THEM GOING AFTER THE THE MEDIA DID THE PRESIDENT HE PARDON
FUNNY BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS IN TORQUAY THAT THE JUDICIARY IS AND HAS BEEN UNDER CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING THE CORRUPTION AND REST AGH OCEANS ARE LAUNCHING A SYSTEM THEY ESTABLISHED ONE JUDGE COURT
WHICH ARE HAND PICKED BY THE ONE AND BEING A UNDER I'VE GOTTA TAKE TAKE IT UNDER THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE HOPING UNDERGOING A BY THE ORDERS OF THE GOVERNMENT JUST O'DONNELL HIMSELF EVEN I'VEGOT HIMSELF REPLACED THIS MIST ACTUALLY THE VERY PRIME MINISTER HE HANDPICKED BECAUSE SHE'S VERY VERY BIG WE ONLY HAVE A FEW SECONDS I JUST WONDER I KNOW YOU'RE OUT OF THE COUNTRY COULD YOU WOULD YOU GO BACK TO TURKEY

ABSOLUTELY WE PROMISED IN THE STRATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS THAT WE WOULD BE INVITING PARLIAMENT TO ENDORSE THE PRINCIPLE OF A FOUR BOAT DETERRENT TAKES AROUND TWELVE YEARS TO DESIGN AND BUILD A NUCLEAR SUBMARINE THE CURRENT SUBMARINES BECOME OBSOLESCENT IN THE EARLY TWENTY THIRTIES SO WE NEED TO GET ON PLAN THE FOUR NEW BOATS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE ASKING PARLIAMENT TO SUPPORT BUT THAT DOES THIS EVENING BUT THAT VOTED IN PRINCIPLE IS YOU SAY THAT WAS AGREED BACK IN
WHAT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN YEARS AGO BUT THIS IS THE NEW PARLIAMENT AND THE NEW STRATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW AND WE'RE ASKING THEM TO ENDORSE THAT PRINCIPLE SO THAT WE CAN GET ON AND START BUILDING THE BOATS AND GIVE THE SUPPLY CHAIN THERE ARE NEARLY A THOUSAND COMPANIES INVOLVED IN THIS WITH LOTS OF JOBS GIVE THE SUPPLY CHAIN THE CONFIDENCE THEY NEED THAT THESE FOR REPLACEMENT BOATS WILL BE BUILT RIGHT SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL US NOW THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY START AS IT WERE IN KING THOSE CONTRACT WHAT ARE THEY CALLED AT THE MAIN GATE OR SOMETHING
YES WE'VE ALREADY STARTED TO DESIGN THE FOUR NEW BOATS TO PURCHASE SOME OF WHAT ARE CALLED THE LONG LEAD ITEMS THINGS THAT TAKE TIME TO CONSTRUCT SO WE SPENT MONEY ALREADY THEN YES PARLIAMENT THROUGH THE ESTIMATES AUTHORISES PUBLIC SPENDING AND WHY WE HAVE THE VOTE FOR SOME YEARS WE HAVE BEEN STARTING TO PREPARE TO DESIGN AND ASSESS HOW WE WOULD BUILD THE FOUR NEW SUBMARINES BUT THE BOAT HERE AS ON THE
PRINCIPLE OF HAVING THE FOUR BOAT REPLACEMENT OH AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE DECIDING TONIGHT THIS IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT ODD DOESN'T IT TO HAVE ALREADY SIGNED CONTRACTS OR TO HAVE ALREADY SPENT SOME MONEY YOU HAVE TO RECALL SOMETHING THAT PARLIAMENT HASN'T YOU SAY A GREAT WITH ODD AND HAS BEEN SOME PRELIMINARY EXPENDITURE BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THE MAIN CONTRACTS HAVE STILL TO BE SIGNED INDEED WE ARE DESIGNING A NEW DELIVERY BODY TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE BOATS
ARE DELIVERED ON TIME AND A BUDGET IN A WAY THAT HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE WITH WILL WE'VE HAD AS YOU WILL RECALL WE'VE HEARD WARSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED RATHER LATE AND RATHER TOO AND RATHER MORE EXPENSIVE HERE THAN ORIGINALLY FORECAST SO WE'RE SETTING UP A NEW DELIVERY BODY TO ENSURE THAT THESE ONES ARE PRODUCED ON TIME AND TO BUDGET
AND THAT IS PART OF THE CASE THAT WE'RE PUTTING TO PARLIAMENT TODAY AND YOU COULD APPLY THAT SAME THOSE ESTIMATES INACCURACIES AS IT WERE TO TRIED AND COULDN'T YOU BECAUSE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THEY RECKON IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY BILLION THEN IT WENT UP TO TWENTY SIX BILLION IT'S AROUND ABOUT THIRTY ONE BILLION WITH A TEN BILLION CONTINGENCY FUND SO THAT'S GOING TO BE AS WE SPEAK COS THEY USE
CONTINGENCY FUND OF COURSE AS WE SPEAK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FORTY BILLION GOD KNOWS WHAT WILL BE LED BY THE TIME WE GET THERE WELL WE WE HAVE TO ESTIMATE THE COST EVERY SO OFTEN WE UPDATED THAT WANT TO GET IT WRONG MASSIVELY NO WE ARE UP TO NO THERE'S BEEN INFLATION AND SO ON WE UPDATED THE COST AT THE STRATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND THIRTY ONE BILLION IS OUR LATEST ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE FOUR BOATS ARE GOING TO COST AND REMEMBER THESE ARE FOR BOATS THAT ARE GOING TO DEPLOY THEIR MISSILES FOR
THIRTY YEAR PERIOD THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY THIRTIES THE TWENTY FORTIES AND THE TWENTY FIFTIES SO YOU NEED TO SEE THE COST AGAINST THAT THIRTY YEAR TIMESCALE ALL RIGHT WELL LET'S ASSUME IT DOES HAPPEN AND LET'S ASSUME IT COMES IN ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE ON COS THE BIGGER QUESTION THE MUCH BIGGER QUESTION IS WHY WE NEEDED A EDNA SEMI IS WHAT YOU WROTE IN THE TELEGRAPH THIS MORNING AND ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS YOU REDUCED IS THAT THREE YEARS AGO NO ONE SAW ISLAMIC STATE COMING
THAT NOW NORTH KOREA OR TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TERRORIST GROUPS ARE TRYING TO GET HOLD OF THEM MISSUS MAY HAS MADE MUCH THE SAME POINT ABOUT THE THREAT FROM TERRORISM SURELY THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE PRECISELY WHAT YOU DO NOT WANT
TO COMBAT TERRORISM IT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE TERRACE WOULD LOVE A STAB NUCLEAR WEAPONS WOULDN'T THEY
LOOK WE CAN'T CHOOSE THE THREATS THERE ARE OUT THERE AGAINST US AND WE CAN'T ALWAYS PREDICT WHAT THREATS WILL COME WE'RE GOING TO CHOOSE WHAT WE FIGHT THEM WITH WELL WE CAN'T BE SURE WHAT THREATS WILL COME AGAINST BRITAIN IN THE TWENTY FORTIES THE TWENTY FIFTIES WE ARE INCREASING OUR SPENDING ON ALL KINDS OF DEFENCE AGAINST TERRORISM
AGAINST CONVENTIONAL ARMS BUILD UP BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP MODERNISING OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS WE KNOW WHY OTHER ROGUE STATES ARE TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS WE KNOW THAT RUSSIA IS MODERNISING ITS NUCLEAR ASS AND WE KNOW THAT THE UNITED STATES OUR PRINCIPAL ALLY IS DOING EXACTLY THE SAME
YES THERE ARE MORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS OUT THERE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE MOST EXTREME FORM OF THREAT AGAINST US BY MODERNISING A DETERRENT THAT SERVED US PRETTY WELL FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS CONSERVATIVE
AND LABOUR BUT THE IDEA OF DEFENDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON THE BASIS THAT IT WOULD HELP US IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM IS SIMPLY RISIBLE ISN'T IT NO WE SPEND MONEY ON TERRORISM ARE SPENDING MORE ON THAT OF COURSE WE DO BUT WE DON'T SPEND ENOUGH IT'S NEVER ENOUGH IS IT I MEAN OF COURSE IT'S NOT YOU'D BE THE FIRST THERE'S A POLISH DIDN'T ADMIT THAT
YOU WOULD ALWAYS LIKE TO HAVE MORE THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE SO ON A SOUNDER GETTING MORE JOHN WE'RE INCLUDE THE DEFENCE BUDGET IS INCREASING WERE SPENDING MORE ON TERRORISM DEPLOYING MORE ARMED POLICE IN OUR CITIES WERE SPENDING MORE ON THE SECURITY SERVICES WERE WORKING ON DE RADICALISATION WE'RE INCREASING THE CONVENTIONAL DEFENCE BUDGET SPENDING MORE ON TROOPS AND PLANES BUT WE CAN'T NEGLECT OUR NUCLEAR FORCE AS WELL IT THE SUBMARINE'S BECOME OBSOLESCENT
AT THE END OF THE TWENTY TWENTY'S THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTY THIRTIES SO WE NEED TO DECIDE NOW WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD TO DISPENSE WITH THEM AND ARE VIEW THERESA MAY'S VIEW THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW AND IN FACT BOTH BULLETS OF MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES AT THE LAST ELECTION IS THAT THIS IS A GAMBLE WE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO TEST SO CAN YOU GIVE ME AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE MIGHT USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BECAUSE OF A TERRORIST SPECIFICALLY
A TERRORIST THREAT LOOK WE USE A NUCLEAR WEAPONS EVERY DAY IT'S A CONTINUOUS PATROL THAT DETERRENT IS OUT THERE ALL THE TIME THEY ARE THERE AS A DETERRENT I'M ASKING YOU THE CIRCUMSTANCE IS USED AS A DETERRENT BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR ADVERSARIES AND THIS GOES DIRECTLY TO YOUR POINT WHETHER THEIR OTHER NUCLEAR STATES ROGUE STATES OR TERRORIST GROUPS WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS
UNSURE AS TO HOW WE MIGHT RESPOND AND WHETHER WE WOULD RETALIATE BUT WHERE DOES THAT THAT IS THE THEORY OF DETERRENCE AND WON'T USE OUR SUBMARINES TO DETER
EVERY SINGLE DAY IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN THE THEORY OF DETERRENCE IN THE DAYS WHEN IS THIS IS THAT THE QUESTION OF MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION WHICH WAS THE DOCTRINE OF THE COLD WAR AND SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT IT WORKED AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION BECAUSE THEY KNEW IF THEY FIRED ONE AND US WE FILE ONE AT THEM BEEN THE END OF IT WITH TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS IT IS PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE THE MADDEST OF THOSE TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS WOULD DEARLY LOVE US TO CHUCK A NUCLEAR BOMB AT SOMEBODY WE'D BE DOING THEIR JOB FOR THEM
WELL I DON'T I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY SURE THAT WE CAN ALWAYS DETER ANY KIND OF ADVERSARY WHETHER IT'S A COUNTRY OR A TERRORIST GROUP
BY LEAVING THEM UNSURE AS TO HOW WE WOULD RETALIATE IF YOU'RE SAYING WE SIMPLY SHOULDN'T BOTHER TRYING TO DEFEND OURSELVES OF THE CONIFER AND I DON'T AGREE JUSTIN WE DEFEND OURSELVES FAR MORE EFFECTIVELY IF WE DON'T SPEND THAT MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITH YOU CAN ENVISAGE EVER USING WELL I'VE TOLD YOU WE DO YOU USE THESE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ALL RIGHT SINGLE DAY WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL THE THREATS AGAINST US WHETHER THEY'RE CONVENTIONAL NUCLEAR OR TERRORISTS THEY ALL NEED TO BE MODERNISED TO FENCE
# COSTS MONEY ALL RIGHT QUICK THOUGHT ABOUT TERM BRECK'S AT THE FRENCH MINISTER SAID THIS MORNING THAT BRITAIN SHOULD START THE FORMAL PROCESS A PROCESS OF LEAVING THE E.U. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO PREVENT EUROPE FALLING INTO UNCERTAINTY WHAT DO YOU THINK HE MEANS BY SOON AS POSSIBLE
WELL WHO'D HAVE TO ASK HIM I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE WE WERE OPERATING ON WE WILL TRIGGER THE EXIT PROCESS AS SOON AS WE HAVE DECIDED ON A NEGOTIATING STRATEGY WHICH IS BEING DEVELOPED BY DAVID DAVIS WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THIS ON THE REST OF THE CABINET AS SOON AS WE HAVE
DECIDED AND FINALISED OUR NEGOTIATING STRATEGY THEN WE'LL BE IN A POSITION TO START FORMALLY TRIGGERING THE EXIT WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE WELL THAT'S THAT'S TO BE DECIDED NOW AS WE FORMULATE THEIR STRATEGY FOR WITHDRAWAL THEN THE EXIT PROCESS WILL FOLLOW
BUT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE END OF THIS YEAR OR EVEN PERHAPS THE END OF NEXT YEAR WELL BEFORE WE TRIGGER THAT POSE I THINK IT'S TOO SOON TO SET OUT AN EXACT TIME TABLE THE NEW GOVERNMENT WAS ONLY FORMED WITH GREAT RESPECT JOHN LAST WEDNESDAY SO IT HAS TO HAVE HAD A GO SAVING STRATEGY IS NOW BEING PREPARED AND ONCE THAT IS FINALISED THEN YOU WILL SEE THE FORMAL
PROCESS BEGIN TO START TO OPERATE BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND CAN'T YOU WHY THEY'RE GETTING A BIT TETCHY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL BECAUSE LOOK BRITAIN'S TAKEN THIS VOTE THEY WANT TO GET OUT WE WANTED TO GET OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING IN THE FUTURE I THINK THAT KNOW THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH THIS IS NOT BY BEING TETCHY WHETHER IT'S THEM OR WHETHER IT'S US THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT TO BE SORTED OUT THERE A LOT OF JOBS AT STAKE IN THIS WE NEED TO BE SURE ABOUT OUR FUTURE
RELATIONSHIP WHAT SHAPE THAT WILL TAKE WITH THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WESTERN EUROPE WE NEED TO PREPARE TO SIGN AND NEGOTIATE AND SIGN TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD I'M AFRAID THAT CAN'T BE DONE IN TWO OR THREE DAYS WE NEED TO SORT THAT OUT VERY CALMLY BUT ONCE THE NEGOTIATING STRATEGY IS FINALISED THEN YOU WILL HAVE YOUR ANSWER ON WHEN THE TIME TABLE WILL BE TRIGGERED MICHAEL FALLON THANKS
# THE TIME NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S APPEALED FOR CALM AND RESTRAINT AFTER THREE POLICE OFFICERS WERE KILLED IN THREE OTHER INJURED WHEN A GUNMAN OPENED FIRE IN BATON ROUGE LOUISIANA YESTERDAY IT COMES AFTER TWO WEEKS OF UNREST ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AFTER POLICE SHOT AND KILLED TWO BLACKMAN LAURA BICKER REPORTS NOW FROM BATON ROUGE
BATTLE ROUGE IS ONCE AGAIN IN PEEL
A COMMUNITY TORN APART BY TWO SHOOTINGS
THE CITY IS USUALLY QUIET USUALLY STILL ON A SUNDAY ALMOST EVERYTHING STOPS FOR A CHURCH BUT NOT ON THIS
POLICE WERE RESPONDING TO A NINE ONE ONE CALL TO REPORTS A MAN WAS CARRYING A GUN ALONG THE METRE MOTOR WEEK NOT FAR FROM THE MAIN POLICE STATION
WHEN HE ARRIVED HE SHOT AT THEM WE'RE GOING OUT WE'RE WITNESSES SEE HE FIRED INDISCRIMINATELY
THE CITY ME A KIP HOLDEN SAID IT BEGAN AS AN AMBUSH STYLE ATTACK AND THAT THIS MAY BE A DEFINING
EIGHTY RELATIONS THIS IS TRULY A SAD DAY GOING BAD AND ROUTE AS WE NOW MEET AGAIN THE HAND SENSELESS KILLINGS WE CONTINUED I ASK THE QUESTION AND CONTINUE TO MAKE THE STATE
PEACE PREVAIL IN BAD ROUTE IN THIS PARISH BATTLE ROUGE HAS BEEN A CITY DIVIDED SINCE OFFICER SHOT AND KILLED ALTMANN STERLING OUTSIDE A CONVENIENCE STORE
MOBILE PHONE FITTED SURE THE OFFICERS HOLDING HIM DOWN GUN POINTED TO THIRTY SEVEN
YEARS OF TENSION BETWEEN POLICE AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY FINALLY ERUPTED INTO THESE OF DEMONSTRATIONS THEY WERE COALS OF NO MORE CRIES FOR JUSTICE

MOST WERE PEACEFUL BUT THERE WERE SOME UGLY SCENES AS PROTESTERS FACED OFF AGAINST POLICE IN HERE
HUNDREDS WERE ARRESTED THE GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA IS JOHN BELL EDWARDS THERE SIMPLY IS NO PLACE FOR MORE
THAT DOESN'T HELP YOU DOES IT FURTHER THE CONVERSATION IT DOES ADDRESS ANY INJUSTICE PERCEIVED OR REAL
IT IS JUST AN INJUSTICE IN A LOVE ITSELF THE MOTIVE FOR THIS SHOOTING IS NOT YET CLEAR THE GUNMAN WAS TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD GAVIN LONG FROM KANSAS CITY MISSOURI IT'S THOUGHT HE RENTED A CAR AND DROVE TO BATON ROUGE THE QUESTION IS WHY
HE SERVED IN THE MARINES FOR FIVE YEARS INCLUDING IN IRAQ HE LEFT A TRAIL OF ONLINE WRITINGS AND VIDEOS ON SOCIAL MEDIA MOSTLY COMPLAINTS AT THE WEEK AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE TREATED BY POLICE
YOU GOTTA FIGHT BACK HE TOLD HIS FOLLOWERS JUST A WEEK AGO
THIS IS THE KIND OF RHETORIC SOME BLACK LEADERS IN BATON ROUGE HAVE FOUGHT SO HARD TO PREVENT AMONG THEM HAS BEEN CLEAVED DONE JUNIOR WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BUT WITH A LOT ALLOWANCE A LOT

THEIR LOVE AND CARE FOR THEM WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT WERE MORE LIKE BEING ARE DIFFERENT BUT WE DO HAVE TO COME TO THE REALISATION THAT THE ISSUE HERE THERE IS A PROBLEM
ONE OF THE VICTIMS MONORAIL JACKSON WAS BLACK AND PROUD OF HIS BADGE HE'S PICTURED ON FACEBOOK HOLDING A YOUNG CHILD
I SWEAR TO GOD I LOVE THIS CITY HE WROTE BUT SOMETIMES I WONDER IF IT LOVES ME
IN A UNIFORM I GET NASTY HATEFUL FULL LICKS AND OUT OF UNIFORM SOME CONSIDER ME A THREAT

# PRONUNCIATION CHRIS ALDRIDGE WITH THE NEWS DON'T GET ME INVOLVED THERESA MAY WILL OPEN A DEBATE IN THE COMMONS AHEAD HAVE A VOTE ON WHETHER BRITAIN SHOULD REPLACE ITS AGEING NUCLEAR ARMED SUBMARINES THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON TOLD US THAT GIVING UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS WOULD BE A GAMBLE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE BECAUSE FUTURE THREATS WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THAT THE SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY EMILY THORNBERRY SAID THE VOTE WAS A POLITICAL GAME AIMED AT EXPOSING DIVISIONS WITHIN LABOUR
# ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARM HOLDINGS SAYS IT'S AGREED TO BE BOUGHT BY A JAPANESE FIRM SOFT BANK FOR TWENTY FOUR BILLION POUNDS THE CAMBRIDGE BASED COMPANY DESIGNS MICROCHIPS USED IN DEVICES SUCH AS APPLES I PHONE IT'S EMERGED THAT THE BLACK GUNMAN WHO KILLED THREE POLICEMEN IN THE AMERICAN CITY ABOUT EN ROUGE YESTERDAY HAD POSTED VIDEO MESSAGES COMPLAINING ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS BY POLICE AND CALLING FOR BLACK MEN TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR RACE THE GUNMAN GAVIN LONG WAS SHOT DEAD
# YOU DETAILS ABOUT STATE SPONSORED DOPING IN RUSSIA ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGED TODAY IN A REPORT COMMISSIONED BY THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY INVESTIGATION WAS LAUNCHED AFTER A FORMER SENIOR RUSSIAN OFFICIAL SAID HE DOPED DOZENS OF ATHLETES AT THE SAATCHI WINTER OLYMPICS
# IT'S NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN THE U.K. EVERYONE POINTS TO ARM HOLDINGS IT'S THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF THE BRITISH TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY BUT IT IS PROPOSING NOT TO BE BRITISH ANY LONGER IT'S MANAGEMENT HAS JUST AGREED TO BE BOUGHT BY A JAPANESE COMPANY FOR TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOMINIC O'CONNELL IS BACK WITH US AND DOMINIC YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO ARMS CHIEF EXEC I HAVE SERIOUS I JUST HAVE A CHAT TO SIMON SEEKERS WHO RUNS A
AS SHE SAID IT'S BEEN AGREED TO BE BOUGHT BY SOFT BANK JAPAN IT'S GOING TO BE TWENTY FOUR BILLION POUNDS MIGHT NOT BE A HOUSEHOLD NAME BUT IT'S A WORLD LEADER IN SHIP DESIGN SO ALL THAT CLEVER TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE I PHONE WORK YOUR TERROR WERE KEEPING YOU WASHING MACHINE WORK COMES FROM A SOFT BANK HAS PLEDGED TO KEEP ARMS HEADQUARTERS IN CAMBRIDGE AND DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF U.K. JOBS FOR ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED
TO ABOUT THREE THOUSAND AND TO KEEP THE ARM MANAGEMENT TEAM IN PLACE CYNICS MIGHT SAY WE HAVE HEARD THESE KIND OF ASSURANCES BEFORE FROM A FOREIGN BUT US ONCE IN THE COMPANY THEY MEAN NOTHING BUT CYGNUS TOLD ME THE TWO COMPANIES ARE IN TALKS WITH THE TAKEOVER PANEL WHICH IS THE CITY WATCHDOG THAT POLICE AS THESE BIG DEALS TO MAKE THESE ASSURANCES LEGALLY BINDING NOW I'M STRUGGLING TO SEE HOW THEY WERE QUITE DO THAT BUT THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE THE DETAILS HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THE DEAL HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY THE TWO COMPANIES ARE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR ABOUT A DECADE
BUT THE TAKEOVER TALK STUDS IS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HAPPENED HAPPEN VERY FAST HE SAID THAT THE REASON THE ARM BOARD HAS CHOSEN SOFT BANKERS IS RECOMMENDING THE DEAL THE SIR RIGHT PARTNER IT WON'T JEOPARDISE OUR NEUTRALITY IT WORKS FOR APPLE IT WORKS FOR SAMSUNG WHICH O'CONNOR MANUFACTURERS WORKING WITH SOPPING WON'T WON'T HARM IT AT ALL AND WE HAVE ALREADY HAD A COMMENT ON THIS FROM THE NEW CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER DRAWDY WELCOMING IT FROM THERE SOUNDS VERY QUICK OUT OF THE BLOCKS AND TAKEN IN CONTEXT THERESA MAY BEFORE SHE WAS MADE
A CONSERVATIVE LEADER PROMISED A PROPER INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY THAT WOULD STOP PREDATORY TAKE IT WAS FOR THE PAYMENT HASN'T HUNG AROUND HE SAID THAT THIS DE SOPPING OFFER SHOWED THAT BRITAIN HAS LOST NONE OF ITS ALLURE TO INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS NOW YOU MIGHT REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME WE HAD A BIG DEAL LIKE THIS WE NEED AN AMERICAN COMPANY CALLED PFIZER BID FOR EXTRAS INIKA
DAVID CAMERON GOT BADLY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF PUBLIC OPINION HE CAME OUT AND FAVOUR THE DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC MOOD TURN SOUR ON THE DEAL HE LOOKED A BIT FOOLISH THIS MARKET TO COME BACK TO HAUNT FOR THE PAM AND DOMINIC THANKS VERY MUCH WHILE LISTENING TO THAT IS THE FORMER BUSINESS ET SECRETARY THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS VINCE CABLE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS IS THIS GOOD NEWS FOR THE D. U. K. OR BAD NEWS
WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD EXPERIENCES WITH OVERSEAS TAKEOVER CARTLAND LENT YOU A LAND ROVER AND A W. AND MY NAME AND THESE THINGS CAN WORK BUT I DON'T WORRIED ABOUT THIS FOR A WHOLE SET OF
PROBABLY MAKING THEM LEGALLY MY DOMINIC MAKES THE POINT THAT TERESA MAY WHEN SHE WAS PITCHING TO BE CONSERVATIVE LEADERS SAID TALKED ABOUT A PROPER INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY SHOULD BE CABLE OF STEPPING IN TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS STEPPING IN TO DEFEND A SECTOR AND SHE WAS PARTICULARLY REFERRING TO PHARMACEUTICALS FROM MENTIONING THE ASTRA'S ANIKA'S PFIZER DEAL BUT IT SORT OF HINTED THAT
IN A CASE LIKE THIS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO STEP IN THEY COULDN'T THOUGH COULD THEY
POSED BREAKS IT
RIGHT AND WHEN THE CHANCELLOR SAYS THAT THIS SHOWS THAT BRITAIN HAS LOST NONE OF ITS ALLURE TO INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS BRITAIN IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS AND OPEN TO FOREIGN INVESTMENTS WHICH HE SET OFF THE BACK OF THIS AND CERTAINLY FROM WHAT WE'VE DONE IS HE'S ONLY COME UP IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS SO CLEARLY IT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE IDEA OF THE U.K. LEAVING THE E.U. DOESN'T AFFECT THIS SORT OF INWARD INVESTMENT
# VINCE CABLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY TWO MINUTES AND I KNOW ONE OF THE DARKEST DAYS IN THE HISTORY OF THE OLYMPICS MOVEMENT THAT'S WHAT MANY ARE ANTICIPATING TODAY WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THE REPORT INTO THE WAY THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN WINNING MEDALS OVER THE YEARS BY CHEATING NOT ONLY OF SOME OF THEIR TOP ATHLETES BEEN TAKING ILLEGAL DRUGS BUT THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF HAS CONSPIRED IN ENCOURAGING IT AND COVERING IT UP WELL MICHELLE BROKEN AROUND THE U.K.'S ANTI DOPING ORGANISATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS
NOW RUNS A DIFFERENT ORGANISATION CALLED SPORTING INTEGRITY AND THIS IS THE PRECISE OPPOSITE OF SPORTING INTEGRITY MICHELLE BROKEN AND THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT IS THAT THIS WAS AN INDEPENDENT REPORT
WELL THIS IS A HUGELY IMPORTANT DAY I THINK NOT ONLY IN THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT BUT ALSO IN THE ANTI DOPING SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY SEE THE VERY SYSTEM WE HAD PUT IN PLACE TO HELP PROTECT ATHLETES WRIGHTSON AND ABILITIES TO PARTICIPATING DRUG FREE SPORT
WE KNOW HAS BEEN CORRUPTED AND WE KNOW THAT FROM REPORTS THAT SEEM TO BE COMING OUT ONE AFTER THE OTHER WE HAD THEIR FOCUS ON ATHLETICS BUT THIS IN PARTICULAR IS IS FOCUSING ON ALLEGATIONS MADE BY THE FORMER HEAD OF THE LABORATORY IN IN RUSSIA HELEN AND ANTI DOPING SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED AS CORRUPTING AND HE APPARENTLY HAS
HAS BEEN GIVING EVIDENCE TO THE HEAD OF THIS INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION ABOUT HOW THIS ALL HAPPENED OVER THE SAATCHI OLYMPICS SO NOW THIS MOUSSE YOU ATHLETICS TO ALL THE WINTER OLYMPIC SPORTS AND HE'S NOW IN HIDING THAT DISCLAIMER THAT'S RIGHT IN HIDING IN THE UNITED STATES AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY A QUESTION MARK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS COMPROMISES
EVERY SPORT COMING OUT OF RUSSIA IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THEY DO THEY'VE BEEN DOING IS TAMPERING WITH TESTS URINE SAMPLES FOR INSTANCE AFTER THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN PRESUME THEORETICALLY THEY'VE BEEN KEPT IN TAMPER PROOF BOTTLES BUT THEY FOUND WAYS OF GETTING AROUND THAT I MEAN IS THAT SORT OF LEVEL OF CORRUPTION
YES AND THAT AND THAT THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL WILL WORRY THE WHOLE ANTI DOPING WORLD BECAUSE IF THE TAMPER EVIDENT BOTTLES HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE TAMPERED WITH AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED IT SEEMS AT THAT COULD HAVE COMPROMISED THE RESULTS FROM THE SAATCHI OLYMPICS SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO
WELL I MEAN AT THE MOMENT WE ARE ALL HOLDING OUR BREATH WAITING TO SEE BECAUSE IN MANY RESPECTS THE SYSTEM HAS TO WORK ON TRUST THAT NATIONAL ANTI DOPING ORGANISATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL SPORTS FEDERATIONS ARE FOLLOWING THE WORLD ANTI DOPING CODE PROCESSES BREAD
THIS IS THIS IS WHERE REALLY THREE WEEKS OUT FROM THE RIO OLYMPICS I'M SURE THERE ARE ATHLETES WHO WERE HUGELY UNDER PRESSURE TO PERFORM THERE WONDERING WHY IT IS THEY'RE NOT JOINING WHAT THEY APPEAR TO SEE IS THE THRONE OF ATHLETES WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHEAT I DON'T WELL RUSSIA CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE
AND THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR STEP OF COURSE TO BAN A WHOLE COUNTRY DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE BANNED WELL IF SOMEBODY IS CORRUPTING THE SYSTEM OF COURSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION AND WE KNOW THERE THERE IS THERE A SMALL PRECEDENTS THERE INTERNATIONAL WEIGHTLIFTING HAS NEVER SHIED FROM BANNING COUNTRIES WHO EXCEED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DOPING OFFENCES IN A YEAR FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES BUT I THINK
THE PRESSURE ON THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE ITSELF TO ACTUALLY UNDERTAKE A BAN IS HUGE AND NOT ONE THAT I THINK THEY WANT TO TAKE WILLINGLY BECAUSE THIS COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE LOST FUTURE VENUES FOR AN OLYMPIC GAMES AND THIS REALLY GOES TO THE HEART OF WHAT INTEGRITY HEARS ABOUT DO WE ACTUALLY WANT A SPORT TO BE
FAIR CLEAN AND SOMETHING THAT WE WANT FUTURE GENERATIONS TO ENJOY OR DO WE REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THIS LEVEL OF SUSPICION THE LACK OF TRUST THAT'S BEEN BUILDING UP OVER RECENT MONTHS MICHELLE BROKEN MANY THANKS IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE

IT'S EARLY IN THE MORNING THEY'VE JUST HAD THEIR BREAKFAST AND THE YOUNGSTERS ARE FORMED AN ORDERLY QUEUE THERE ABOUT TEN OF THEM AGED BETWEEN TEN AND THIRTEEN QUEUING UP TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR H.I.V. MEDICATION FROM NURSE
ACCESS TO TREATMENT MAY HAVE COME A LONG WAY FEWER BABIES ARE BEING BORN WITH THE DISEASE BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WHICH STILL KEEPS INFECTION RATES HIGH HERE IS STIGMA
GILL JOHNSON HAS THE JOB OF MENTORING YOUNGSTERS LIKES ANNELI PREPARING THEM TO GO INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD BUT IT'S A HOSTILE PLACE IF YOU'RE A TEENAGER WITH THE AIDS VIRUS WE NEED YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE INFECTED SHOULD BE AMBASSADORS FOR FOR H.I.V. POSITIVE YOUNG PEOPLE BUT THEY STILL VERY NERVOUS
VERY EMBARRASSED ABOUT COMING FOR IT BECAUSE THEY WILL BE JUDGE THEY WON'T BE RIDICULED AND MAY BE REJECTED CHANGING ATTITUDES TO SEX AND TO THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN IN SOUTH AFRICA WILL BE CRUCIAL IF INFECTION RATES AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TO BE REVERSED
SCIENCE MAY HAVE MOVED ON BUT SOCIETY IS LAGGING BEHIND SO THE EXPERTS AND AIDS IS STILL A FOUR LETTER WORD THAT SPELLS SHAME
# THAT WAS KAREN ALLEN REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE STABILITY OF TURKEY MATTERS TO ALL OF US IT IS IN THE JARGON A DIPLOMAT'S A STRATEGICALLY VITAL COUNTRY WHICH IS WHY WESTERN GOVERNMENTS ARE SO WORRIED BY WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING THERE SINCE FRIDAY HERE'S BORIS JOHNSON THE FOREIGN SECRETARY AS HE WENT INTO A MEETING OF E.U. FOREIGN MINISTERS I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN VIEW OF THE FAILED
WE SEEN THAT RESTRAINT MODERATION ON YOUR SITE ABOUT HOIST YOUR HAM
WELL YES THE CODED FAIL BUT THE AFTERMATH IS PROVING SCARY A MASSIVE CLAMPDOWN THOUSANDS OF ARRESTS NOT JUST IN THEIR MILITARY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED JUDGES LOCKED UP TO PRESIDENT ONE IS BECOMING MORE POWERFUL BY THE MINUTE OR SO IT SEEMS SHOULD THAT WORRY US WAS HE A MORALE IS A RESEARCH FELLOW BUT THE ARMY'S NEW CENTRE FOR HISTORICAL ANALYSIS AND CONFIT RESEARCH BARONESS WHO IS A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PEERS MEMBER OF YOUR PARTY GROUP ON TURKEY ZOOMER
SHOULD WE BE WORRIED IN THE SENSE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS OBVIOUSLY ACCRUING MORE POWER TO HIMSELF I THING AT THIS STAGE THIS IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT IT PRESIDENT ACQUIRING MORE POWER PERSONALLY DIS IS ABOUT ESTABLISHING LAUREN AUDIT AND FEARS OVER ENOUGH TO MAP EXCUSE ME IN A SHUT THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO CONTAIN OR BE SEDUCED OF TRYING TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THESE MILITARIA OFFICIALS SAID NETWORKS ME AREN'T MILITARY WHERE DID THEY WERE PART OF THIS SO
EXCUSE ME SO IT'S ALL THE MORE CORRECT TO CHALLENGED TO GO ARE MEANT TO ASK REDEMPTIVE REMAIN WRITTEN BUT I WOULDN'T JUST MAKE THIS ABOUT A DYING JUST YET WHAT ABOUT YOU
I THINK HE HAS JUST SAID IS CORRECT I THINK WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO HE'S TRYING TO DO NOW IS TO RESTORE HIS HIS AUTHORITY AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PALE Q. HAS INDEED FAILED AND THERE AREN'T ELEMENTS OF IT STILL IS STILL TRYING TO RESEARCH BUT I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THE PEOPLE SHOWED THE PEOPLE CAME OUT IN THEIR MASSES TO HIS CALL TO OVER TWO TO MAKE SURE THE CREW WASN'T SUCCESSFUL
BUT THEN HE HAS TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ECO PARTY THE RULING PARTY MUST ALSO REMEMBER THAT THE OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE GONE OH NO FRIENDS ABOUT HER ONE ALSO SUPPORTED DEMOCRACY THE RULE OF LAW AND TRIED THEIR BEST TO GET PEOPLE TO REJECT
THE MILITARY COUP BUT THEIR FOLLOWERS FIRST PEOPLE WHO AREN'T NATURAL OR A.K. SUPPORTERS MUST ALSO BE SUPPORTED AND WHAT TURKEY REALLY NICE IS NOW MORE DEMOCRACY NOT LESS DEMOCRACY AND WHEN HE WAS START LOCKING UP JUDGES IN THIS NUMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED JUDGES LOCKED UP
I WON'T YOU'RE NOT ALL LUCKED OUT I THINK SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR POSTS THE SUM OF THE NUMBER HAS BEEN BACKED UP BUT IT IS IT REALLY RIDDLE NO WE HAVE SEEN TODAY DECOMMISSIONING OF SOME THOUSANDS OF POLICE OFFICERS AS WELL SO THE COUNTRY'S CLEARLY GOING TO DO IT TRULY DISTURBING AN OPEN ENDED PROCESS BUT I THINK ITS WEIGHT AND ITS ALLIES WITH TIN Y. U. N. INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COME BY AND SAY HAVE A LOOK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE TO MATTER DISCO IS HANDLED PROPERLY WRITTEN WITH FOR EXAMPLE
TALKS ABOUT BRINGING BACK DEATH PENALTY TO TURKEY'S TRILBY AND IT WILL STOP YOU NEGOTIATION TALKS FOR GOOD BUT AT THE SAME TIME OF COURSE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT THE IMMEDIATE COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER SUCH A HISTORIC AN UNPRECEDENTED SERIES OF U.S. HAVE AND FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS WILL BE MESSIER DOWN RE IMAGINED STOPS THE E.U. THE ADMISSION OF COURSE TALK THOSE STALKS LADIES
NO CAN'T TOO THERE THROUGH THAT HAS THE DEATH PENALTY IS LIKELY TO BE ALLOWED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS IT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE UM THE MORE IMMEDIATE EFFECT AND THAT IS THE AGREEMENTS WE'VE MADE IT OVER MIGRANTS CROSSING FROM TURKEY INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT EFFECT WILL IT HAVE ON THAT
OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE IN THE FOREMOST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY'VE BEEN VERY KEEN TO ENCOURAGE TURKEY WOULD START THE RESTART THE ACCESSION TALKS AND TO GET INTO DEALS IN ORDER THAT TURKEY CONTAINS THE THREE MILLION OR SO SIERRA JEWS THAT THEY ARE HOSTING IN THEIR COUNTRY AND OF COURSE THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE FACTOR IN THE DESTABILISATION OF TURKEY WERE SEEN THE TERRORIST ATTACKS
AND YOU KNOW KNOCK ON EFFECTS RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS TO REACH OUT FAR MORE IN THERE MORE IN THERE MORE GROWN UP WAY TO TURKEY RATHER THAN DANGLING A CARROT
A FIT EUROPEAN ACCESSION TO TO ACTUALLY EXCEPT THE TURKEY IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND NEIGHBOUR VERY STRATEGIC WHOOPS CHEEKY IMPORTANT COUNTRY AND NOT JUST USE IT IN A WAY THAT YOU KNOW YOU WILL CONTAIN ALL THE SIRHAN REFUGEES OR STOP THEM COMING INTO EUROPE WHICH IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND OF COURSE THE BRICKS ARE DEBATING
IN BRITAIN HASN'T HELPED IN PAINTING TURKEY AS A COUNTRY OF SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION MUSLIMS THAT ARE ALL GOING TO COME OVER TO BRITAIN IN THE WAY THAT OH NOW FOREIGN SECRETARY WAS SAYING DURING THE CAMPAIGN PAINTING TURKEY IN THAT IN THAT SORT OF LIGHT HAS NOT BEEN HELPFUL AS WE'VE DEMONSTRATED AT THE TURKISH PEOPLE EXTREMELY PROUD OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WANT DEMOCRACY AND WANTS AND I MOST WANT TO REMAIN THERE SO THAT HAS TO BE SUPPORTED SO HOW SHOULD WE
DEALING WITH THE ONE NOW WHAT'S YOUR ATTITUDE TO HIM I THINK FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT I DO I DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT'S A VERY LARGE COUNTRY TO TIZZY BUT WAS IT A MASSIVE IMPLICATIONS THAT WILL UNFOLD FOR ME DYLLIS FOR HER NOT TO AFRICA FOR EUROPE WERE DIVIDING REGION SO FIRST OF ALL I THINK GOOD AND GOOD RELATIONSHIPS GO A LONG WAY IF WE TOOK A STRUCTURES IT'S NOT AN IMPERSONAL REALITY ACTING AT THIS STAGE YOU ARE FACING A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS JUST SO LIGHT
DIRECT PHYSICAL THREAT TO ITS EXISTENCE EXPRESSIONS OF SOLIDARITY AND GENUINE SUPPORT THEN FRIENDSHIP WILL GO A LONG WAY DOWN JUST INNUENDOS AND STATEMENTS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF EUROPEAN UNION AT THIS STAGE AND SECONDLY CLOSE TO ASK FOR A RULE OF LAW HAS TO BE COMMUNICATED NOT IS THERE WE ARE STICK THERE HE'S BEEN GREAT IN THIS MAGICAL WAY BUT ACTUALLY FOR STABILITY OR TURKEY THAT ON ME A SOLITAIRE KID THAT IS DEPENDABLE AND RELIABLE ON CLEAR LEGAL BOUNDARIES WILL PREVENT FURRED RECLUSE
THIRDLY FROM NOW ON TURKEY WILL NEED SUBSETS A CREATIVITY AND REFORMING IT'S MATIS STRUCTURES FORM ENGLISH JUDICIAL STRUCTURES ARE FORMING THIS PULLEY STRUCTURES YOU CAN UNION COULD STAND UP AND OFFER A PRAYER ACTIVE PRESENCE IN OUR LODGES IF I'M PUT SISSY'S GET ALONGSIDE THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND SAY WELL HUGH I DID BEST PRACTICES HE RIDE ILLEGAL FAIR MARKS LET US HELP YOU LET US BE PART OF THIS PROCESS LET US STRENGTH STRENGTHEN TURKISH SOCIETY AND ALSO SUPPORT THE SEWER SOCIETY IN TURKISH MEDIA WOULD BE TRULY IMPORTANT
GOVERNMENT HAS A TENDENCY TO GIVE A KNEE JERK REACTION AND BAM PESTS BANDS ON MEDIA STOPS HE WERE THE WRITER SICHER INTERESTING THE OLD THE LAST THREE DAYS IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO HIT THE STREETS ET-CETERA SO I THINK FOR YOU COMMUNION TO CONTINUALLY REMINDED THAT LOOK ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES WHERE ARE DUE VEST MAJORITY I'VE TEXTED NOT WANT THIS WE HAVE TO END SHOULD AT THIS REMAINS THAT WAY WE MUST END IT THERE I'M AFRAID THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH OF HIM OR RATHER BONUS
# IT'S SIX MINUTES TO NINE WHY HAVE WE BEEN SO SURPRISED SO SHOCKED BY THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS THE REFERENDUM RESULT RESIGNATION OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE CHALLENGE TO THE LABOUR LEADER THEY WERE ALL THINGS THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT AS POSSIBILITIES AND IT WHEN IT HAPPENED IT FELT AS THOUGH THE WHOLE WORLD WAS CHANGING IN AN ENTIRELY UNPREDICTABLE WAY
DAVID SPEAKER HELTER IS THE WINTON PROFESSOR FOR THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE'S STATISTICAL LABORATORIES IN CAMBRIDGE AND IN BRISTOL IS THE PHILOSOPHER JULIAN BUDGIE BUDGIE AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING MORNING PROFESSOR SPEAK WILL HER WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT OUT VOTING OUT WAS A POSSIBILITY IF WE PUT ASIDE FOR A MOMENT THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT PLANNING FOR IT WHY WERE WE ALL MENTALLY SO UNPREPARED
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DUST DON'T THINK THROUGH ALL THE POSSIBLE FUTURES THAT MIGHT HAPPEN NICE KIND OF THINK OF THE FUTURE IS AN UNCOUNTABLE NUMBER OF CONTINUOUSLY BRANCHING POSSIBLE PATHS FOR JUST ONE OF THESE PATHS END UP HAPPENING EACH ONE'S VERY UNLIKELY BUT IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SURPRISES YOU NEED TO REALLY SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT WHERE THESE PATHS MIGHT TAKE YOU IMAGINING ALL THESE POSSIBLE FUTURES
AND WE'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT I DON'T THINK POLITICIANS ARE VERY GOOD AT IT AT ALL FORTUNATELY SOME PEOPLE ARE QUITE GOOD AT HISTORY YOU MAY GET A BIT BORED DOING YOUR HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK ASSESSMENT FOR YOUR LOCAL FETE BUT BUT PEOPLE OPERATE NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS HAVE TO THINK OF EVERYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG AND YOU MAY NOT KNOW THERE'S A PUBLIC NATIONAL RISK REGISTER OF CIVIL EMERGENCIES IT'S A NATIONAL SECURITY RISK REGISTER WERE PEOPLE THINK THROUGH
ALL THESE POSSIBLE DISASTERS CATASTROPHES THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO THAT WHEN THEY DO HAPPEN THAN NOT SURPRISED OH CAPA JULIA BUT THAT THAT'S THEIR JOB TO DO THAT FOR THE REST OF US WE'VE GOT OUR LIVES TO GET ON WITH SO PRESUMABLY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE RANGE OF THE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX POSSIBILITIES IN LIFE BUT EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU'RE IT PROFESSIONALLY I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT REALLY SORT OF GETS TO YOU PERSONALLY COS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH ANY DAY
WE HAVE TO GO ON THIS BASIC ASSUMPTION OF THINGS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE PRETTY MUCH AS THEY HAVE DONE BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY LITTLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHERE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LAWS OF PHYSICS BEHIND IT OR THE PRINCE WAS BEHIND IT WE TURN ON THE TAP WATER'S GOING TO COME OUT YOU PRESS THE SWITCH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO COME ON WE WOULD GO CRAZY IF WE WERE CONSTANTLY THINKING ABOUT ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH THINGS MIGHT NOT CONTINUE THE SAME SO WE INEVITABLY LULLED INTO THIS SORT OF JUST
BASIC EXPECTATION THINGS ARE GOING TO BE MORE OR LESS THE SAME EVEN IF INTELLECTUALLY WE UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SECURE EMOTIONALLY SO INSTINCTIVELY THAT'S THE PLACE WE'RE STUCK AT IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE THE REFERENDUM RESULT WHICH HAS TRIGGERED SO MANY OTHER THINGS BUT WAS A BINARY CHOICE I MEAN THERE WERE
MORE THAN HALF THE COUNTRY HAVE MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE WHO VOTED WANTED IT TO HAPPEN WHY IT STILL DOESN'T QUITE ALTON AWAY WHY EVERYBODY SEEM SO SURPRISED AFTERWARDS WHAT I SAID I THINK EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED IF YOU SPEAK TO PEOPLE IN IN SORT OF TOWNS LIKE LIKE RATHER A RICH I KNOW IN OTHER PLACES IN IN AREAS WHERE PEOPLE DID VOTE OUT THEY'RE NOT SURPRISED AT ALL A LOT OF THEM
I THINK IT GOES TO SHOW THAT AGAIN A SENSE OF WHAT'S NORMAL THESE ARE VERY MUCH SHAPED BY OUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS THE PEOPLE WE LISTEN TO THAT THE NEWSPAPERS ARE RE READING THE INFORMATION WE GET THAT CREATES LITTLE BUBBLE WHICH PROTECTS OUR STATUS QUO WORLDVIEW PROFESSOR SPEAK DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THEN WHY GOVERNMENT SEEMED SO UNPREPARED FOR THE OUTCOME I MEAN I AGREE WITH JULIAN THAT'S HOW I AM AS WELL I WAS I WAS SURPRISED BUT ACTUALLY WHAT YOU DO HOPE IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND THE BANK OF ENGLAND OR WHATEVER
WHO ARE BEING A BIT MORE SERIOUS THAN THE REST OF US BECAUSE NOW YOU CAN THINK WELL YOU KNOW IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT CHANCE THE BRICKS IT WOULD WIN WAS BEING GIVEN ON THE ON THE BETTING MARKETS AND JUST THINK O.K. WHAT IF WE DID GO DOWN THAT PATH AND THEN SUDDENLY ACTUALLY LOOKS QUITE REASONABLE CAMERON MIGHT RESIGN QUICKLY MADE BEING THE NEXT PREMISES NOT AT ALL IMPLAUSIBLE EVEN BORIS JOHNSON AS FOREIGN SECRETARY ONCE YOU DO START THINKING IN THIS WAY WHICH I ADMIT IS VERY DIFFICULT VERY ALIEN TO US
THEN ACTUALLY THIS MAY BE A WAY TO AVOID SURPRISE AND YET THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THOUGH THAT EVEN IF YOU HAD THOUGHT IN ADVANCE THESE THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN WHEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS ISN'T THERE A SORT OF MAYBE JUST BECAUSE IT'S A CHANGE THERE'S AN EXCITEMENT FEAR A SENSE OF THE INSTABILITY WELL AS WELL I THINK THAT BECAUSE WE'RE SO USED TO THINGS CONTINUING THE SAME WHEN ANY KIND OF EXCEPTIONAL EVENT HAPPENS WE TEND TO ASSUME THAT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS CASE IT MIGHT BE
BUT OFTEN ACTUALLY THE MOST DIFFICULT CHANGES DON'T OCCUR AS A RESULT OF A BIG EVENT TO TAKE ONE EXAMPLE MOTHER BIGGEST CULTURAL SHIFTS IN OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN WE'VE GONE FROM A SITUATION WHERE NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY STAND AS LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND BE AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE FROM A SITUATION WHERE NO ONE COULD HAVE STOOD BEING FOR IT NO MAJOR EVENT HAPPENED IN THAT TIME BUT THAT HAS BEEN A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT SHIFT WHERE SOMETHING LIKE LIVE AID A HUGE BIG EVENT ARGUABLY DIDN'T CHANGE SOCIETY IN THE WAY THAT A LOT OF COMMENTATORS AT THE TIME THOUGHT IT WOULD
DO YOU THINK ULTIMATELY THOUGH THEREFORE PROFESSORS BIGGER HEALTH GIVEN WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE THAT WE SHOULD THINK DIFFERENTLY THAT WE SHOULD PERHAPS ON THIS PROGRAMME WE SHOULD BE ASKING DIFFERENT QUESTIONS RATHER THAN JUST SAYING TO SOMEBODY RATHER SIMPLY WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO HAVE
WELL ACTUALLY I DO AGREE I THINK THIS BUSINESS OF JUST GETTING SOMEONE TO STATE WHAT OFTEN WHAT THEY HOPE WILL HAPPEN RATHER THAN WHAT THEY THINK WILL HAPPEN IS IS PRETTY REMOTE I THINK MUCH BETTER TO THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES AND MAYBE YOU COULD ACTUALLY ASK PEOPLE HOW LIKELY THEY THINK IT'S GOOD THAT IT WILL HAPPEN AND SHE USED AND THINK THROUGH THESE LESS LIKELY EVENTS AND JUST THINK THROUGH THOSE CONSEQUENCES WHERE THE PEOPLE'S ZONE OUT AS A RESULT OF THAT PROFESSOR DAVID SPEAKER HOLTER JULIAN BUT JEANIE THANK YOU EDITORS WERE TRACY RUBINSTEIN AND LAURA COVER FROM ALL OF US TO ALL OF YOU GOOD MORNING
