IT'S SIX O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH NICK ROBINSON AND JUSTIN WEBB THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON IS TO ANNOUNCE WHOLESALE REFORM OF THE PRISON SERVICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES GIVING NEW POWER TO GOVERNORS MORE THAN TWO DAYS AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE IN TAIWAN RESCUERS HAVE PULLED TWO PEOPLE ALIVE FROM A COLLAPSED BUILDING
ALSO IN TODAY'S PROGRAMME CALLS FOR THE CHIEF OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE TO APOLOGISE OR RESIGN OVER THE WAY THE FORCE INVESTIGATED ALLEGATIONS OF HISTORIC SEXUAL ABUSE ABOUT SET SENIOR FIGURES WHY THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING NEW REGULATIONS FOR CONTROVERSIAL EXPERIMENTS THAT COMBINED CELLS FROM HUMANS AND ANIMALS
SOME OF THESE EXPERIMENTS MIGHT GET VERY CLOSE TO OR EVEN CROSS OVER BOUNDARIES WHICH PEOPLE FIND VERY DISTASTEFUL OR UNETHICAL
AND THE LONG STANDING EUROSCEPTIC CHARLES MORE REPORTS FOR US ON IMMIGRATION AS THE DEFINING ISSUE OF THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM FORMER AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER JOHN HOWARD HAS SOME ADVICE THE GREAT MASS OF THESE DROWNING PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT CONTINUED IMMIGRATION AND GIVEN OUR HISTORY QUIET HIGH IMMIGRATION BUT REALLY
WHEN I THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S LOST CONTROL OF WHO IS COMING TO THE PLACE THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY DIANA SPEED
PLANS TO TRANSFORM THE PRISON SERVICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL BE SET OUT BY DAVID CAMERON TODAY HE'LL CONDEMN THE FEELINGS OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM AS SCANDALOUS AND SAY THAT PRISONERS SHOULD BE TREATED AS POTENTIAL ASSETS RATHER THAN LIABILITIES HE'S DANNY SURE
IT'S HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR A PRIME MINISTER TO TAKE SUCH A CLOSE INTEREST IN PRISON REFORM BUT DAVID CAMERON WANTS TO MAKE IT A GREAT PROGRESSIVE CAUSE IN BRITISH POLITICS HE BELIEVES JAILS ARE FAILING BECAUSE OF HIGHER REOFFENDING RATES AND LEVELS OF VIOLENCE DRUG TAKING AND SELF HARM WHICH HE SAYS SHOULD SEAMUS ALL
MY CAMERON WANTS GOVERNORS TO HAVE AUTONOMY OVER HOW PRISON SPEND THEIR BUDGETS AND WHICH EDUCATION SERVICES THEY USE THE IDEA WILL BE PILOTED IN SIX PRISONS THIS YEAR LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW SO THE PLANS FOR REFORM PRISONS AS THEY'RE BEING CALLED CAN BE ADOPTED MORE WIDELY THE HOWARD LEAGUE FOR PENAL REFORM SAID THE PRIME MINISTER'S VISION WOULDN'T BECOME A REALITY WHILE PRISONS REMAINED OVERCROWDED
THE ENERGY COMPANY TO A TOWEL IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT HAS BEGAN PRODUCING GAS FROM A HUGE NEW PLANT IN THE SHETLAND ISLANDS IT'S THOUGHT THE SITE WILL EVENTUALLY PRODUCE EIGHT PER CENT OF THE U.K.'S SUPPLY OF GAS
THE PRIME MINISTER IS EXPECTED TO SAY THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO PULL OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MIGRANT CAMPS LIKE THE JUNGLE IN CALAIS COULD APPEAR IN SOUTH EAST ENGLAND IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM ON THE E.U. MEMBERSHIP DAVID CAMERON OR SUGGEST THERE'S NO ARRANGEMENT ALLOWING BRITISH BORDER GUARDS TO CHECK PASSPORTS IN FRANCE COULD BE SCRAPPED IN THE EVENT OF A VOTE TO LEAVE CRITICS HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF SCAREMONGERING OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON REPORTS
IT'S THIRTEEN YEARS SINCE THE BRITISH AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS AGREED THAT PEOPLE HEADING TO THE U.K. FROM CALAIS WOULD FACE CHEQUES FROM BRITISH BORDER GUARDS WHILE STILL IN FRANCE IN THAT THOSE WITH NO ENTITLEMENT TO TRAVEL TO THE U.K. COULDN'T LEGALLY AT LEAST EVEN BOARDS THE BOAT OR TRAIN
NOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS PLANNING TO ARGUE THAT IF VOTERS BACK LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION FRANCE WOULD USE THIS AS AN EXCUSE TO SCRAP THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS MANY MIGRANTS WOULD NOT ENCOUNTER A BRITISH BORDER GUARD UNTIL THEY WERE ON BRITISH SOIL A SPOKESMAN FOR VOTE LEAVE ONE OF THE GROUP'S ARGUING FOR WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION SO THE CLAIM AMOUNTED TO THE HEIGHTS OF SCAREMONGERING ADDING THAT THE AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR E.U. MEMBERSHIP
SEARCH TEAMS HAVE RESCUED TWO PEOPLE FROM A COLLAPSED BUILDING IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN MORE THAN TWO DAYS AFTER IT WAS TOPPLED IN AN EARTHQUAKE THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE ARE NOW KNOWN TO HAVE DIED IN THE BUILDING AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED ARE STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR A CORRESPONDENT RUPERT WRINKLED HAYES SENT THIS REPORT FROM THE CITY OF TIME

THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL HAS SAID IT WILL IMPOSE NEW SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREA AFTER THE COUNTRY LAUNCHED A LONG RANGE ROCKET UNITED STATES ACCUSED NORTH KOREA OF TRYING TO ADVANCE ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME AND OF ATTEMPTING TO DEVELOP INTERCONTINENTAL MISSILES FROM WASHINGTON LAURA BICKER REPORTS
NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SANCTIONS FOR A DECADE ASSET FREEZERS TRAVEL BANDS AND FINANCIAL EMBARGOES HAVE ALL BEEN ATTEMPTED THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY IS NO COIN ON THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL TO IMPOSE WHAT HE DESCRIBES A SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES ON PYONGYANG THAT COULD INVOLVE TOUGHER FINANCIAL PENALTIES ON AN ALREADY IMPOVERISHED COUNTRY THE FEED IN CHINA IS OF ECONOMIC REFUGEES FLEEING TO ITS BORDER
THE U.S. HAS ALSO DECIDED TO TAKE DEFENSIVE ACTION AND WILL BEGIN FORMAL TALKS TO DEPLOY AN ADVANCED MISSILE DEFENCE SHIELD IN SOUTH KOREA PLASTIC SURGEONS ARE REPORTING THAT A RECORD FIFTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE UNDER WENT COSMETIC PROCEDURES IN BRITAIN LAST YEAR THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR AESTHETIC PLASTIC SURGEONS SAYS NINE OUT OF TEN PATIENTS WERE WOMEN BUT THE NUMBER OF MEN HAVING OPERATIONS IS INCREASING

A TEST BY NORTH KOREA U.S. URGES CHINA TO PUNISH PEE ON YANG FOR THE ROCKET TEST IS THE PAPERS LEAD STORY THE TIME CHOOSES INSTEAD TO GO ON THE N.H.S. N.H.S. LOCUMS EXPLOIT CRISIS TO GET HIGHER RATES OF PAY IT'S GOT AN INTERVIEW WITH AN N.H.S. REGULATOR WHO POINTS OUT THAT THE INDIVIDUAL DOCTORS OR NURSES WHO SAY WHEN THEY'RE ASKED TO DO AND AN EXTRA SHIFT I WANT X. FOR THAT CHEF NO NO I WANT X. PLUS Y. COS I'VE JUST BEEN OFFERED Z. FROM HER NEXT DOOR HOSPITAL
THE MALE CHOOSES TO GO ON THE PRIME MINISTER'S BIG SPEECH ON PRISON'S LOCK UP PRISONERS JUST FOR THE WEEKEND IS THEIR HEADLINE AND THE GUARDIAN'S HEADLINE IS WHAT THEY CALL AN EXCLUSIVELY YOU ACT OVER TAX AVOIDANCE BY GLOBAL FIRM SAYING THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ARE GOING TO PRODUCE NEW RULES AND YOU MAY RECALL WE HAD A BIG INTERVIEW WITH THESE COMPETITION COMMISSIONER MARGARETHE VESTIGE IT RECENTLY AND SHE'S WORKING ON NEW RULES TO CRACKDOWN ON COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK AND AMBER'S IN THE PAPERS
DAILY MIRROR LEADS ON THIS DECISION BY FILMMAKERS TO EXPLODE A BUS ON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF LONDON MORONIC IS THE MIRROR'S HEADLINE SEVEN SEVEN SURVIVORS ATTACK FILMMAKERS FOR SPARKING PANIC WITH A BLAST BOMB OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT A HUGE FIREBALL THERE'S AN AMAZING PICTURE ACTUALLY THE MIRROR CLAIMS IT'S SPARKED FEAR AND PANIC YESTERDAY
THERE WAS A STUNT FOR THE JACKIE CHAN MOVIE THE LATEST ONE CALLED THE FOREIGNER STARS PIERS BROSNAN AMONG OTHERS BUT HER DESPITE WARNINGS FROM PRODUCERS UNSUSPECTING PASSERS BY AND CHILDREN PLAYING IN A PARK NEXT TO THE BLAST NEAR PARLIAMENT NO IDEA IT WAS MAKE BELIEVE THEY HAVE
TALK THE MIRROR TO SECURITY CONSULTANT CALLED JOHN TAYLOR WHO'S TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER CARRIE DIED AT ALDGATE TUBE ON SEVEN SEVEN HE WAS WORKING AND IT HUNDREDS OF YARDS AWAY FROM THIS EXPLOSION AT TATE BRITAIN THE ART GALLERY HAD NO IDEA THAT THE GLASS WAS TAKING PLACE PENNY THERE HAD BEEN WARNINGS HAVE BEEN WARNINGS ABOUT FILMING
BUT NOT WARNINGS ABOUT THE BUS BEING BLOWN UP WAS ACTUALLY ON LAMBETH BRIDGE WITH A FEW ACROSS TO WESTMINSTER A COUPLE OF PAPERS LOOK AT THE PRESSURE ON BERNARD HOGAN HOWE THE HEAD OF THE MET WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT AFTER SEVEN OR EIGHT HE'S GOING TO FACE M.P.S' QUESTIONS THE TELEGRAPH TELLS US AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND THE MAIL SAYS THAT HE IS FINALLY READY TO APOLOGISE IN BRACKETS SAYS IF ONLY TO SAVE HIS JOB IT IS NOW TEN PAST SIX
NOW WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE ABOUT THE NORTH KOREAN ROCKET LAUNCH NOT EXACTLY ON THE FRONT PAGES OF THE PAPERS TODAY BUT CERTAINLY ON THE INSIDE PAGES AND PLENTY OF PEOPLE SAYING THAT IT IS A REALLY SERIOUS BUSINESS GIVEN THAT THE NORTH KOREAN LEADERSHIP SEEM SO DANGEROUS EVEN DERANGED SOME PEOPLE WOULD SUGGEST THAT POTENTIALLY THIS ROCKET LAUNCH GIVES THEM A WAY OF DELIVERING A NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT WE KNOW THERE HAVE
SOUTH KOREA'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UN OH JUNE SAID IT WAS TIME FOR THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL TO PASS A TOUGH RESOLUTION AGAINST NORTH KOREA THE ONLY WAY TO STOP MOST KOREA FROM GOING FURTHER DOWN THE NUCLEAR PATH IS TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE REGIME
THAT HE HAS NO OPTION BUT TO CHANGE IT IS THEREFORE AN URGENT TASK BEFORE DISCUTER CONSTRUE TO ADOPT IS SIGNIFICANT AND ROBUST SECLUDED CAST RESOLUTION THAT EXCEED
MOST COURIERS EXPECT ASIANS AND SENDS A MESSAGE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WE'RE NEVER TOLERATE ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT TURNED KEVIN CAME OUR CORRESPONDENT IN SEOUL SOUTH KOREA I MEAN I SUPPOSE THE FIRST THING IS
THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL IS MUCH MORE UNITED ON THIS THAN ON ANY OTHER SUBJECT REALLY AT THE MOMENT ISN'T IT AND HAS AT LEAST MET AND DECIDED THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE AND EVERYONE IS UP FOR THAT
WILL BE THAT HIS NATION SAID USE OF BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY BY NORTH KOREA EVEN IF CHARACTERISED AS A SATELLITE LODGE OR A SPACE WATCH YOUR CALL COULD CONTRIBUTE TO
CHRI IST NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME AND SAID IT WAS A SERIOUS VIOLATION OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND SOUTH CREEK HAS WELCOMED YOU KNOW DES NATIONS DECISION TO PURSUE FURTHER SAYING SHE'S AGAINST THE NORTH YEAH BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE
WELL I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS THERE THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT STEPS CAN BE PIGGIN WHEN THE NORTH HAS BEEN SINGED IN SO MANY TIMES
THIS TIME THE NORTH HAS CONDUCTED A NUCLEAR TEST AND HAS ENGAGED IN BALLISTIC MISSILE ACTIVITY THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL HAS SAYING SEND IT WITH BARE ARMS TRADE AND THE BLOCKING OF BY NATURAL TRANSACTIONS AND A BEAR EVEN EXPORTING LUXURY GOODS ON TO DEAL WITH
WHAT FURTHER AND STRONGER STATIONS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED COULD COOK COULD CHINA AGREED TO STOP AUCH OIL SICKNESS FOR INSTANCE TO THE NORTH THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION AND MOST EXPERTS ARE POINTING TO THE POLITICAL WILL OF CHUCK OF CHINA AND SAYING THAT POLITICAL WILL IS STILL NOT THERE
THE NATION'S SECURITY COUNCIL HAS YET TO COME UP WITH AN AGREEMENT I THINK SHIN'S IN RESPONSE TO NORTH KOREA'S FOURTH NUCLEAR TEST IN JANUARY
NOW THAT HAS GONE AHEAD WITH THE ROCKET LARGE WILL BECOME HARDER FOR CHINA TO RESIST INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO EXERT MORE INFLUENCE ON ITS ALLY NEIGHBOUR
OH KEVIN CAME IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH TALK MORE ABOUT THIS TWENTY SEVEN IT IS SIX THIRTEEN NOW THAT WE'VE REACHED A HIGH IN THE LIST OF STORM MANY NAMES TO HIT THESE AISLES STORM IMOGEN IS ON ITS WAY BRINGING EIGHTY MILE AN HOUR WINDS HIGH TIDES AND HEAVY SHOWERS POLICE SERGEANT COLIN TAYLOR IS ON SAINT MARY'S IN THE ISLES OF SCILLY
WE'VE HAD SOME VERY HIGH WINDS OVERNIGHT WINS THE ROCK ROOFS ON HOUSES HERE
IT'S ALSO HIGH TIDE JUST BEFORE DAWN
AND SEEN SOME SPECTACULAR GREEN WAVES COMING IN AND POUNDING THE KEY HERE AND OPEN TOP IN SENDING SPRAY
FORTY OR FIFTY FEET INTO THE AIR IT'S CLEAR SKIES AT THE MOMENT SO WE'VE GOT NO RAIN THERE HAD BEEN READY GROWING UP IN THE OVERNIGHT AND TO BRING HIS MORE SCOTT BINGHAM A REPORTER IS IN NEWQUAY SCOTT PRESUMABLY NOT A DAY TO GET THE BOAT TO GO SURFING
CERTAINLY NOT WE'RE HERE UP ON THE HEADLAND ABOVE NEW THE NORTH CORNWALL COAST AND WINDS ARE GUSTING AROUND EIGHTY MILES AN HOUR HERE AT TIMES WE'RE HAVING TO SHELTER IN THE LEE OF A HOTEL AND HER LAST NIGHT THE FIRE EXIT ACTUALLY BLEW IN AT ONE POINT SMASHING OR CRACKING THE GLASS
BUT AMBER WARNINGS ARE IN PLACE THAT MEANS BE PREPARED BASICALLY ACROSS THE WHOLE OF CORNWALL WITH JUST OVER AN HOUR AGO THE MET OFFICE HAS ISSUED A WARNING A PHENOMENAL SEAS OFF THE COAST
SOME TRAIN SERVICES ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST DOWN IN WALES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED NETWORK RAIL IS WARNING PASSENGERS TO EXPECT DELAYS ON SOME ROOTS AND HERE CLOSER TO HOME IN IN THE REGION HAS BEEN LOCALISED FLOODING
SOME DEBRIS ON THE ROADS THE A. THIRTY FIVE NEAR DORCHESTER FOR INSTANCE IS BLOCKED AND THE SEVERN BRIDGE HAS BEEN CLOSED BUT IT'S THIS WIND WHICH IS REALLY CAUSING PROBLEMS HERE THAT'S EXPECTED TO AFFECT THEIR MORNING COMMUTE SO WHERE DRIVERS ARE BEING WARNED TO TAKE CARE ON THE ROADS AS THEY HEAD OUT THIS MORNING TO RARELY TALKED ABOUT ROAD FLIGHTS TO PRESUMABLY COULD BE DISRUPTED IN CERTAIN AREAS
YES CERTAIN FLIGHTS OUT OF THERE IT'S NEWQUAY HERE ALMOST CERTAINLY DO YOU EXPECTED TO BE AT THE AIRPORT IS JUST A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY SO I'M BEING VERY BUFFETED BY THE WIND SO FLIGHTS ARE LIKELY TO BE DISRUPTED THE INFORMATION AS EVER IS TO CHECK WITH THE AIRPORT BEFORE TURNING UP
AND SOME FERRY SERVICES ARE DUE TO BE AFFECTED AS WELL WITH THOSE HEAVY SEAS AND THE WINGS FOR NIGHT THE RAIN SEEMS TO HAVE HOLD OFF BUT THERE IS STILL SOME LOCALISED FLOODING OR RANG SO
YES IT IS PRETTY PRETTY BLUSTERY HERE SCOTT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRAVING IT CLEARLY IS MORE SEVERE WEATHER AT THE MOMENT THERE'S ALSO A SLIGHT SENSE THAT IF YOU GIVE IT A NAME IT'S GOT TO BE SERIOUS ENOUGH TO DO IN THE NEWS AS WELL IF WE JUST SAID IT'S A BIT BLOWY
ROGER ORDER HE RETURNED QUITE MERIT THE SAME COVERAGE BUT THERE WE ARE LET'S CROSS FROM ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY RIGHT THE WAY ACROSS THE OTHER SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX BECAUSE SIMON IS IN SHETLAND AND THIS MORNING IT IS A VERY BIG DAY FOR SHETLAND NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE SIMON NO JUSTIN THANK YOU TAKE EFFECT HAVE SURPRISINGLY MILD MORNING HERE TO REGULAR LISTENERS OF THE SHIPPING FORECAST IT'S ACTUALLY RATHER WARM AND NOT WINDY AT ALL AND IT'S SURPRISING BECAUSE YOU'RE CLOSER TO NORWAY HERE THAN WE OUGHT TO SCOTLAND AND WE'RE HERE
BECAUSE LES TODAY WERE EXPECTING CONFIRMATION OF THE U.K.'S BIGGEST CONSTRUCTION PROJECT SINCE THE OLYMPICS WILL COME ON LINE AND START DELIVERING GAS WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE UP EIGHT PER CENT OF ALL THE U.K.'S GAS NEEDS ANOTHER FANFARE HOWEVER AROUND THIS PROJECT HAS OF COURSE BEEN MUTED SOMEWHAT WHY WHAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY TO OIL AND GAS PRICES I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO MICHAEL BY HIS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA FOR THE TOE TOLD THE FRENCH ENERGY GIANTS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION BUSINESS
I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IN A PROJECT LIKE THIS AND IN MANY OIL AND GAS PROJECTS IS TO TAKE A LONG TERM VIEW OF OIL PRICES AND OF GAS PRICES
WHEN WE EMBARKED UPON THIS PROJECT THE OIL PRICE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN IT IS NOW JUST TO GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF THE GAS PRICE IN THE U.K. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS MORE THAN HALVED BUT WE NEED TO TAKE A LONG TERM VIEW OF OIL PRICES AND GAS PRICES TO SEE THE RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENT THAT WE MAKE BECAUSE WE WILL BE PRODUCING FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS WITH SOMETHING LIKE LIKE ANT
IS THIS THE LAST PLANT OF ITS KIND THAT YOU CAN ENVISAGE DOING IN THIS AREA THE LAST DAY EVER OF LOOKING INCREASINGLY BYGONE ERA FOR THE NORTH SEA
SO THAT I AM TO MORE DEVELOPMENT IS AN INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT IT'S SUB SEA WE HAVE FOUR WELLS ON ONE FIELD ONE WELL ON THE OTHER LITTER DRILLED THREE KILOMETRES DOWN FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA THERE IS NO PRODUCTION FACILITIES THAT ARE LOCATED AT THE SURFACE AND WERE ABLE TO CONTROL THAT FROM ONE HUNDRED FORTY KILOMETRES AWAY IN THE SHETLAND ISLANDS
WHAT THAT ALLOWS US TO DO IS TO PUT IN PLACE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE AND OTHERS CAN THEN TIE IN NEW FIELDS NEW DEVELOPMENTS NEW GUESS RESOURCES TO AND THIS IS AN INTERESTING AND EXCITING NEW OPENING OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE U.K. AND FOR ITS CONTINENTAL SHELF
SO YOU BASICALLY TECHNICAL ADVANCES MEAN THAT YOU CAN DO MORE FOR LESS AND END AWAY ONCE IT'S UP AND RUNNING IT SORT OF IT IT'S A RUNS ITSELF IS SLIGHTLY JOB LIGHT SURE THERE WAS A LOT OF JOBS THAT WENT INTO THE CREATION OF THIS BUT ONCE IT'S GOING IT RUNS ITSELF
I WOULDN'T SAY IT RUNS ITSELF THIS IS REALLY IS A TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGE TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN PLACE A PROJECT LIKE THIS AND THEN TO RUN IT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ONE HUNDRED FORTY KILOMETRES OFFSHORE THAT'S LIKE RUNNING A PROJECT IN BATH FROM THE CENTRE OF LONDON WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO INTERVENE AT ALL
SO WHILE IT IS TRUE TO SAY WE'VE GENERATED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF JOBS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF THIS WE HAD A PEAK OF SOMETHING LIKE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SHETLANDS ONCE WE GET INTO THE OPERATIONS THAT NUMBER DROPPED QUITE CONSIDERABLY BUT WE WILL CREATE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY AND EIGHTY NEW TECHNICAL POSITIONS IN THE SHETLANDS TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE THIS FACILITY
THERE'S BEEN THIS TALK ABOUT DASH FOR GAS I KNOW YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ENERGY SECRETARY DO YOU FEEL THAT THE U.K. HAS GOT A COHERENT AND CLEAR ENERGY POLICY
I THINK YOU SHOULD PROBABLY ASK AMBER RUDD THAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IT'S CLEAR FOR US THAT OUR PRODUCTION LEVELS AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR BOTH TO THE U.K.'S ENERGY MIX AND TO THE SECURITY OF SUPPLY QUESTIONS FOR ENERGY LONG TERM IN THE U.K.
IF YOU KNEW PRICES WERE GOING TO BE HERE TODAY WOULD YOU HAVE STARTED FIVE YEARS AGO AND PUT IT OTHER WAY WOULD YOU BUILD ANOTHER ONE OF THESE TODAY
I THINK IF I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ANOTHER ONE OF THESE TODAY USING THE TECHNOLOGY WE'VE GOT AND FOR A LONG TERM ECONOMICS WE CAN DERIVE AGAIN FOR LONG TERM GAS PRICES WE WOULD BE LOOKING VERY SERIOUSLY AT THIS PROJECT AGAIN YES YOU WOULDN'T SAY LET'S LET'S HOLD OFF YOU WOULDN'T ROUND THE BOARDROOM TABLE AT HOTEL THEY WOULDN'T SAY GOSH ACTUALLY AT THESE PRICES WE'RE NOT SURE IT MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE
I THINK AROUND THE BOARD TABLE AT HOTEL WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE ECONOMICS LONG TERM OF ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE SHORT TERM VOLATILITY OF ALL PRICES AND THE LONG TERM OUTLOOK THAT WE HAVE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS PROJECTS WHERE WE CAN USE OUR EXPERTISE TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF SOCIETY FOR ENERGY AND CREATE VALUE FOR OURSELVES
SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY HE MADE OUT THAT YOU KNOW GAS MAY BE LESS ENVIRONMENTALLY DAMAGING THAN COAL BUT IT STILLER A HYDROCARBON AND DIGGING BIG HOLES IN THE SEA BED IS NOT THE BEST USE OF OUR TIME WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO PEOPLE LIKE THAT
SO GAS HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE ENERGY BALANCE GOING FORWARD AND IS AN IMPORTANT TRANSITION FUEL THAT CAN HELP US MEET THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECT ONE OF THE THINGS I POINT OUT ABOUT THIS PROJECT IS ITS ENVIRONMENTAL CREDENTIALS WERE IN A SENSITIVE AREA
IN THE SHETLANDS WHERE WE PUT THE GAS PLANT AND IS PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO THE LONG TERM WE WILL BE STORING SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF PEAT FOR THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT SO THAT WE CAN REINSTATE THE PEAT BOGS WHEN WE LEAVE AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE KNOWN WE WERE THERE TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE QUANTITY OF PEAT THAT WILL BE STORING IT SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN TIMES THE ALBERT HALL FULLY FILLED WITH PEAT
AND SO IT'S A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT ON OUR SIDE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO OUR COMMITMENT
MICHAEL BURRELL FROM TOTALITY ANNOUNCEMENT EXPECTED A LITTLE LATER THIS MORNING I'LL GIVE YOU AT ALL IN THE NEXT HOUR OF THIS FORMIDABLE FACILITY IT REALLY IS QUITE SOMETHING BUT FOR THE MO LET'S GET THE THOUGHTS OF RICHARD DUNBAR INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND JOINS US ACTUALLY DONE A LOT FROM EDINBURGH BUT CONFUSING BUT RICHARD ON THAT POINT ABOUT THE OIL PRICES THAT WE WERE TOLD THAT WAS ONE MARKET FELL THE ENERGY MARKET OTHER MARKETS WOULD TAKE COMFORT FROM THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A JOLLY GOOD THINK ABOUT HASN'T REALLY HAPPENED
THE RULE OF THUMB FROM THE ECONOMIST WOULD BE THE PRICE FOR TEN PER CENT OF THE OIL PRICE ADDS ABOUT POINT TWO PER CENT TO GLOBAL GROWTH AND YOU WITH THE HAT BEFORE THAT YOUR FORMULA PRICE OF FIFTY PER CENT YOU WE SHOULD HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS AND I THINK THERE'S VARIOUS REASONS WHY THAT'S NOT BEEN THE CASE THE FIRST BEING THAT INVESTORS ARE SAYING THE PRICE IS TELLING ME SOMETHING
SOMETHING BAD ABOUT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS PERFORMING WORSE THAN PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING PREVIOUSLY WHEN WE'VE HAD FALLS OF THIS MAGNITUDE IT'S A LIGHT CENTRAL BANKS CUT INTEREST RATES WITH BUT WITH INTEREST RATES AT ZERO AT THE MOMENT THAT'S NOT REALLY POSSIBLE AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK THE PRECIPITOUS NATURE
OF THE FALL HAS CAUSED PROBLEMS IN THE LIGHTS AND MIDDLE EAST BRAZIL VENEZUELA AND I THINK SOME OF THE JUPITER YOUR POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE OUTWEIGHING THE OUT UNDOUBTEDLY DEPOSIT POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS FOR HER FOR THE USERS OF THE OF OIL BECAUSE MARKETS AS THEY FINISH THE WEEK LAST WEEK ON THE BACK FOOT AND THERE THERE WERE SOME WEAKER EMPLOYMENT DATA OUT OF THE U.S.
IT WAS MIXED EMPLOYMENT DATA THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY JOBS CREATED WHICH WAS A LITTLE FEWER THAN INVESTORS HAD EXPECTED BUT THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE EARNINGS AND THERE WAS MORE HOURS WORKED SO THE FEDERAL RESERVE WATCH THE LABOUR MARKET VERY CAREFULLY AND THERE WAS GOOD AND BAD NEWS FOR THE FARED IN THESE FIGURES MARKETS TOOK AT NEGATIVELY ON FRIDAY BUT EXPECTATIONS OF INTEREST RATES HAVE RISEN AGAIN
AND UNITED STATES PURELY BECAUSE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME OF THE DOOM SAYERS ARE SAYING THAT THERE IS ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. ECONOMY AND THERE IS AN INCREASE EARNINGS AND MORE EYES BEING WORKED WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THINGS MAYBE A LITTLE MORE POSITIVE AND SOME HAD EXPECTED THE MARKETS ARE PRETTY EDGY AREN'T THEY I MEAN GOLD HAD ITS BEST WEEK IN THE YEAR'S LAST WEEK WHAT TO INFER FROM THAT
COOL IS DIFFICULT TO VALUE AT THE BEST OF TIMES AND HENCE BECOMES AN INVESTMENT STORYTELLERS PARADISE BUT THAT SAID I THINK WE'RE IN A WORLD WHERE CENTRAL BANKERS SEEM TO BE
FALLING OVER THEMSELVES TO COME UP WITH FURTHER CLEVER WAYS TO DO THEIR CURRENCIES AND THEY'RE FOR HAVING SOMETHING IN YOUR PORTFOLIO WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS OF CENTRAL BANKERS PROBABLY HAS SOME MERIT AND I SUSPECT THAT THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN THE PRICE THIS YEAR AND I SUSPECT MORE WILL COME TO THAT CONCLUSION THEN AND THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD
OH KAY RICHARD DUNBAR FROM ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT MANY THANKS LET US REMIND YOU THE BUSINESS DO THIS MORNING IS COMING FROM LERWICK IN SHETLAND AND THIS IS A GROUP OF ISLANDS THAT'S BEEN TRANSFORMED BY THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND SHETLAND DID WHAT MANY THINK THE U.K. SHOULD HAVE DONE WHEN IT'S NORTH SEA OIL SET ASIDE SOME OF THAT MONEY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ISLANDS' LONG TERM A SORT OF SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND IF YOU LIKE I WENT TO LOOK FOR SOME OF THE TRAPPINGS OF ALL THAT OIL WEALTH
SO WE'VE COME TO BRAY WHICH IS A VILLAGER ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE ON THE WEST COAST OF THE ISLAND YOU CAN SEE OUT TO SEA THERE'S A COUP OVER THERE THERE'S A FISH AND CHIP SHOP THERE'S A CURRY HOUSE BRAY HIGH SCHOOL JUST ON ON MY LEFT HERE AND NEXT TO IT IS THIS PLACE

MARIAL ART CENTRE IN THE MIDDLE OF LOWICK WERE PARTLY FUNDED
BY THE SHEPHERD CHARITABLE TRUST A FUND SET UP BY COMPENSATION PAYMENTS WHEN THE OIL INDUSTRY CAME TO DISTURB EVERYONE'S LIFE HERE IN SHETLAND DECADES AGO
I'M JONATHAN WILLS I'M SHETLAND COUNSELLOR ANNUM VICE CHAIR OF THE SHETLAND CHARITABLE TRUST THE IDEA WAS THAT EVERY SMALL COMMUNITY IN SHETLAND NOT JUST LERWICK THE THE ONLY TOWN WOULD BENEFIT SO IN EVERY COMMUNITY PER THOUSAND PEOPLE OR MORE YOU HAVE A LEISURE CENTRE OFTEN WITH A POOL YOU'RE SEVEN OLD PEOPLE'S HOME
NORMALLY YOU WOULD HAVE FOR A POPULATION TWENTY TWO THOUSAND YEARS I'VE WON THE GRANNY FOUND IN THE TOWN IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE OIL INDUSTRY CAME AND DISRUPTED EVERYTHING
THE POPULATION WENT UP BY A THIRD ALL THESE IMMIGRANTS THESE OIL INDUSTRY IMMIGRANTS THEY DID IT HOUSES THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH HOUSES ROADS WERE TERRIBLE SOCIAL SERVICES WERE UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE EDUCATION WAS UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE A DISTURBANCE PAYMENT WAS
AND THAT OVER THE YEARS TO ABOUT TWO THOUSAND WHEN IT ENDED AMOUNTED TO EIGHTY ONE MILLION POUNDS A TRUST WAS SET UP AND ALL THAT MONEY WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUST THE TRUST INVESTS
DOCTOR SHARES IN BONES OF PROPERTY DOES IT CAUSE A LOT OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE USED FOR WELL WHERE THERE'S MONEY THERE'S ALWAYS SQUABBLES BUT THEY'VE ALL BEEN RESOLVED
SO FAR IN A FRIENDLY FASHION BECAUSE OUR TRUST ACTS TO FUND OTHER TRUSTS THERE'S A RECREATION TRUST WHICH RUNS THE LEISURE CENTRES IN THE POOLS THERE'S AN ARTS TRUST WHICH RUNS
WONDERFUL CULTURAL CENTRE MARIAL THAT WAS SITTING IN THIS EVENING AND AFTER THE RECENT CRASH IN THE STOCK MARKET OF COURSE WE'VE LOST MONEY WE WILL HAVE A NEW POLICY THAT WE'RE NO LONGER GOING TO DIP INTO THE CAPITAL
TO HELP US OVER THESE ROUGH TIME WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS TRUST SELF SUSTAINING IN PERPETUITY WE TOOK THAT EIGHTY ONE MILLION WE HAVE INVESTED IT AND IT'S ACTUALLY RAISED THEY'VE GOT TURNED OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OUT OF THAT WAS SPENT GETTING ON FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN A COMMUNITY OF TWENTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE

THE PRIME MINISTER WILL SAY A VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD LEAD TO MIGRANT CAMPS LIKE THE ONE IN CALAIS APPEARING IN SOUTH EAST ENGLAND AND SUGGESTED TO BRITISH EXIT COULD SEE FRANCE SCRAPPING THE AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWS U.K. BORDER GUARDS TO CHECK PASSPORTS IN FRANCE CRITICS HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF SCAREMONGERING
SEARCH TEAMS IN TAIWAN HAVE RESCUED A MAN AND A WOMAN FROM A COLLAPSED BLOCK MORE THAN TWO DAYS AFTER IT WAS BROUGHT DOWN BY AN EARTHQUAKE THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE DIED IN THE QUAKE AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED ARE STILL MISSING
UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL SAYS IT WILL DRAW UP NEW SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREA FOLLOWING PYONGYANG ZE LAUNCH OF A LONG RANGE ROCKET THE SECURITY COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY CONDEMNED TO THE NORTH KOREAN ACTION DESCRIBING IT AS DANGEROUS UNITED STATES OR SAID IT CAN'T BE BUSINESS AS USUAL AS PYONGYANG AND STRINGENT NEW SANCTIONS ARE NEEDED
A TEENAGER WOULD APPEAR IN COURT THIS MORNING CHARGED WITH TERROR OFFENCES THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD FINNISH NATIONAL WHO LIVES IN SOUTH EAST LONDON IS ACCUSED OF PLANNING TERRORIST ACTS HE WAS ARRESTED AT STANSTED AIRPORT ON FRIDAY STRONG WINDS AND HEAVY RAIN BROUGHT BY STORM IMOGEN ARE CAUSING DISRUPTION ACROSS SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND SOUTH WALES WINDS OF MORE THAN NINETY MILES AN HOUR HAVE BEEN RECORDED SPEED RESTRICTIONS ON RAILWAYS HAVE LED TO SERVICES BEEN DELAYED OR CANCELLED
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVING COSMETIC SURGERY IN BRITAIN HIT A RECORD HIGH LAST YEAR OR FIFTY ONE THOUSAND AND NINETY PER CENT OF OPERATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT ON WOMEN WITH THE BIGGEST INCREASE BEING IN LIPO SUCTION
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HE DINER IT'S A TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW CLAIM FOLLOWED BY COUNTER CLAIM A GLIMPSE OF THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN TO COME YESTERDAY THE LEADING LEVER DAVID DAVIS CLAIM THE MORE MIGRANTS WOULD COME HERE AS A RESULT OF DAVID CAMERON'S REFORMS TO THE TODAY THE PRIME MINISTERS WE'VE JUST BEEN HEARING HE'S READY TO CLAIM THAT THE SO CALLED JUNGLE MIGRANT CAMP WERE MOVED TO THE U.K. IF WE DO VOTE TO LEAVE THE E. YOU MAKING SENSE OF IT ALL
OR A SYSTEM OF POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH I SUPPOSE NO BUT IT PROVES THAT THEY BOTH SIDES THINK IMMIGRATION IS A KEY DRIVER OF VOTES IT ABSOLUTELY DOES UNDERLINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH IMMIGRATION IS GOING TO BE CENTRAL TO THIS REFERENDUM BUT I THINK IT IS ALSO INDICATIVE OF A DESIRE WITHIN DOWNING STREET TO MAKE THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN MUCH MORE ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY HENCE THIS WARNING THE PRIME MINISTER'S GOING TO ARGUE THAT IF WE LEAVE THEN THE JUNGLE WILL IN EFFECT COME
TO DOVER IN OTHER WORDS THE SORT OF CAMPS ALONG THE FRENCH FERRY PORTS WHICH ARE POLICED BY THE FRENCH AT THE MOMENTS THEY WILL NO LONGER BE WILLING TO DO THAT AND WE WILL HAVE TO DO IT HERE IN OTHER WORDS A SORT OF CHAOS AND SQUALOR AND VIOLENCE THAT YOU SEE AT THOSE CAMPS WILL COME TO THE U.K. NOW THOSE CAMPAIGN TO LEASE THAT IS NONSENSE IT IS PROJECT FEAR US TRYING TO FRIGHTEN PEOPLE AND BY THE WAY IS A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WE HAVE WITH FRANCE IT IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE E.U.
DOWNING STREET SAY EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WILL CHANGE IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH COUNTRIES IN THE REST OF EUROPE IF WE PULL OUT BUT THERE IS A BROADER CONTEXT TO THIS AND THAT IS I THINK
NUMBER TEN WANT TO PUSH THE ARGUMENTS AROUND SAFETY AND SECURITY SO AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE HAVING THIS MORNING I THINK WE'LL HEAR MUCH MORE ABOUT ATTEMPTS TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES WHICH ENABLE TERROR SUSPECTS TO COME TO THE U.K. MORE ABOUT THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT MORE ABOUT SHARING OF INTELLIGENCE WITH OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS AND MY SENSE IS THAT THERE IS A DESIRE TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE VERY TECHNICAL ARGUMENTS AROUND YOU NO TAX CREDITS AND EVER CLOSER UNION AND RED CARDS TO THE MUCH MORE
VISCERAL GUT INSTINCTS OR DO YOU FEEL SAFE DO YOU FEEL AS A COUNTRY WE WOULD BE BETTER PROTECTED IF WE PULL OUT ITS PEOPLE FOR VOTERS THERE HIS NAME DIFFICULT I HAVE TO SAY FOR A BH JOURNALISTS AS WELL THAT IN MANY OF THESE CASES YOU SIMPLY CANNOT ANSWER WHICH SIDE IS TELLING THE TRUTH THESE ARE MATTERS OF JUDGEMENT AS TO WHETHER THE FRENCH WOULD OR WOULD NOT FOR EXAMPLE TEAR UP THIS AGREEMENT NO AMOUNT OF ASKING QUESTIONS CAN PROVE THAT THEY WOULD
ALTHOUGH THEY WOULDN'T AT AND TO SOME EXTENT THAT IS INDICATIVE OF THE WHOLE DEBATE IF YOU TAKE EVERY AREA THERE IS A COMPLETE BLIZZARD OF FAX AND COUNTER FACTS WHERE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC IT IS VERY HARD TO COME TO A KERNEL OF TRUTH WHICH
FROM MY READING ACTUALLY MAKES THIS CAMPAIGN HARDER FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO PULL OUT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ALWAYS EASIER TO MAKE THE CASE TO KIND OF HANG ON TO NURSE FOR FEAR OF WORSE AND IT'S A MUCH HIGHER BAR TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY THERE ARE BRIGHTER SUNLIT UPLANDS OVER THERE IF YOU WILL JUST MAKE THE CHANGE SO IN A WAY WHERE THERE IS THIS COMPLETE CONFLICT OF FACT WHERE IT'S VERY HARD TO GET ANY CLEAR TRUTH
THAT DOES SEEM TO MEET HAD GIVEN ADVANTAGE TO THOSE WISHING TO STAY NOW TALKING OF HANGING ON TO NURSE WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO TODAY I THOUGHT I WAS GOT A VERY BIG SPEECH
ON PRISON REFORM AND THE SUGGESTION SEEMS TO BE FROM HIS FRIENDS THAT HE IS HANGING ON TO HIS FRIENDS MY CAMERON VERY CLOSE TO HIM OF COURSE RATHER THAN HIS PRINCIPLES WHICH WOULD LEAD HIM TO SAY LET'S GET OUT HUGE HUGE SPECULATION AROUND WHAT MICHAEL GO IT WAS GOING TO DO AS YOU SAY WE HAVE THE SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER TODAY WHICH NUMBER TEN AS THE FIRST MAJOR SPEECH ON PRISON REFORM BY PRIME MINISTER IN TWENTY YEARS YOU WOULD EXPECT SURELY FOR GOODNESS SAKE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY TO BE OUT THERE ON THE AIRWAYS MAKING THE CASE NO SIGN OR SIGHT OF HIM
WHY BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE WILL INEVITABLY FACE THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO WILL HE WON'T HE THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS IF HE DOES DECIDE TO CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE HE WILL NOT TAKE A LEADING ROLE I HE WILL NOT LEAD THE CAMPAIGN DELIBERATELY PITCHING HIMSELF AGAINST THE PRIME MINISTER CONTINUING SPECULATION AROUND BORIS JOHNSON IT WAS A LENGTHY ARTICLE IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH TODAY
I MEAN READING IT ON THE ONE HAND ON THE OTHER HAND DOESN'T SEEM TO COME TO ANY CONCLUSIONS BUT MY SENSES IF I WAS IN NUMBER TEN READING THAT I WOULD TAKE THE VIEW THAT ACTUALLY BORIS JOHNSON HE'S LEANING TO SUPPORT THE PRIME MINISTER BECAUSE OF THIS HE'S A MAN GIRDING HIS LOINS FOR THE BIGGEST POLITICAL TUSSLE OF HIS LIFE IT IS A VERY RHETORICALLY UNDER CHARGED APPROACHES TAKING AND DOES NOT SEEM TO ME TO BE THE SORT OF APPROACH AS SOMEONE WHO'S PREPARING TO DO BATTLE
WE WILL WATCH THIS SPACE NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT TURNED OUT TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN THE FUTURE OF BRITAIN'S TOP POLICEMAN DOES NOT LOOK SECURED DANNY SURE AS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY THINGS WITH SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE THE COMMISSIONER OF THE MET THINGS COMING TO A HEAD IN WHAT THE NEXT TWO WEEKS
WELL I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ISSUES HERE THE FIRST ISSUE IS ABOUT OPERATION MIDLAND THE CONTROVERSIAL INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED SEX ABUSE AND MURDERS INVOLVING MEMBERS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IT'S A CONTROVERSIAL OPERATION WHICH A NUMBER OF THE NEWSPAPERS ARE SAYING HE'S GOING TO BE WOUND UP AND THIS PRESSURE ON SIR BERNARD IT IS SAID TO MAKE APOLOGIES TO YOUR BRAMBLE AND THE FAMILY OF LITTLE BRITAIN
AND THAT TOGETHER WITH THE FACT THAT HIS CONTRACT RUNS OUT IN SEPTEMBER HE WANTS TO BE HE WANTS IT TO BE EXTENDED HE'S BEEN OFFERED AN EXTENSION OF THE YEAR BY THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON IT'S NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE HOME SECRETARY WHETHER SHE AGREES ON UP THOSE TWO EST YOU SEEM TO BE CONFLATED
I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE IS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THEM BECAUSE THE DECISION THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY WILL HAVE TO MAKE WILL BE BASED ON A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND THE FUTURE OF THE MET
AND NOT JUST AT THIS INVESTIGATION BUT A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS SEEM TO BE LINKING THE TWO AND THERE HAS ALSO BEEN AN INVESTIGATION HASN'T CONDUCTED BY DORSET POLICE DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE IN TO THE LEON BRITTAN BUSINESS AND THE WAY IN WHICH THAT CASE WAS HANDLED AND BASICALLY SAYING THAT THAT THAT THERE WAS A CASE IT WAS RIGHT THAT THE THING WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED AS THAT WEIGHING ON SIR BERNARD'S BEHALF
WELL IT CERTAINLY HELPS THE MET IN THE SENSE THAT IT THIS REVIEW BY DORSET POLICE SUPPORTS THE BROAD APPROACH THAT SCOTLAND YARD TOOK DURING THE INVESTIGATION ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME CRITICISMS AND SOME WEAKNESSES WITH THE INQUIRY SO THAT WALL WILL NO DOUBT HELP A LITTLE BIT BUT AS I SAY I DON'T THINK THAT IN THE BROAD RANGE OF THINGS OR THERESA MAY WHEN SHE COMES TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOUSE
WILL LOOK AT THAT PARTICULAR CASE WHAT SHE WILL LOOK AT IS THE METS RECORD ON CRIME FIGHTING TERRORISM ARE TACKLING A FINANCIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE BUDGET AND THE FUTURE GOING FORWARD THERE'S GOING TO BE MAYORAL ELECTIONS IN MAY SHE PROBABLY WON'T WANT TO BIND BORIS JOHNSON SUCCESSOR FOR THREE YEARS
BY ALLOWING THE APPOINTMENT OF SOMEONE FOR A LONG TIME SO THOSE ARE THE ISSUES I THINK A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS AFTER PUT IT VERY DELICATELY PUT I THINK ONE OR TWO OF THEM MAY HAPPEN AGENDA AGAINST SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE MAN THAT PERHAPS IS INFLUENCING SOME OF THE COVERAGE WHEN YOU MADE A POINT THERE DANNY AND A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SUBJECT PRESENCE ON THE PRIME MINISTER TODAY IS THIS REALLY I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO SEE ACTION MEN THAT GENUINELY CHANGES OUR PRISONS IS THAT WHAT WE BEING PROMISED
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS A PILOT SCHEME INVOLVING SIX WHAT HAD TO BE CALLED REFORM PRISONS WHICH WILL BE ANNOUNCED LATER THIS YEAR THAT WILL HAVE THAT WILL ALLOW GOVERNESS TO HAVE FAR MORE CONTROL OVER PRISON BUDGETS THE EDUCATION SERVICES THEY COMMISSION AND IF THAT POLITICS IS THOUGHT TO BE SUCCESSFUL THEN LEGISLATION WILL FOLLOW ALLOWING MORE PRISONS TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE
WHETHER THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN THE LONG RUN AND ACHIEVES THE PROMISES OBJECTIVES OF IMPROVING REHABILITATION AND LEARNING PROSPECTS FOR PRISONERS WELL THAT WOULD DEPEND ON REALLY WHETHER YOU CAN GET THE PRISON NUMBERS DOWN BECAUSE I THINK MOST PEOPLE AGREE THAT WITH EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PRISONERS IN JAIL AT THE MOMENT AND STAFFING PRETTY STRETCHED
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE TO THE PROSPECTS OF OFFENDERS SO IT'S I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND WHAT OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS THE PRIME MINISTER MIGHT MAKE IN TERMS OF SENTENCING I THINK THAT THAT'S THE CRUCIAL THING THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR IN HIS SPEECH TODAY THAT'S HUNCHING WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE PRISON REFORM TRUST HOOKED HOPPER STATE DANNY SURE THANKS
IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS MOST OF THEM REPORT THE IDENTITY OF ANOTHER BRITISH MEMBER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE SO CALLED I.S.L. NICKNAMED THE BEETLES WHICH BEHEADED WESTERN HOSTAGES IN SYRIA THE GUARDIAN SAYS IT'S INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED THAT THE THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD GREW UP IN WEST LONDON AND ATTENDED THE SAME MOSQUE AS TWO OTHER BRITISH MILITANTS INCLUDING THE CELL'S LEADER MOHAMMAD M. WILES
WIDELY KNOWN AS COARSE AS JIHADI JOHN WHO WAS KILLED IN A DRONE STRIKE IN NOVEMBER THE TELEGRAPH CLAIMS THE MAN IS A QUEEN'S PARK RANGERS FAN WHO TRAVELLED TO GO OVER GAZA IN TWO THOUSAND NINE ON AN AID CONVOY ORGANISED BY THE FORMER M.P. GEORGE GALLOWAY THE TIMES EDITORIAL FOCUSES ON THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE MIND HIS VIEW IN ITS VIEW I SHOULD SAY HIS CONTRACT SHOULD NOT BE EXTENDED DESCRIBING SIR BERNARD'S MANAGEMENT OF THE INVESTIGATION INTO
AND ALLEGED TO V.I.P. PAEDOPHILE RING AS DISASTROUS THE TIMES ACCUSED OF LACKING BOTH SOUND JUDGEMENT AND AN ABILITY TO WITHSTAND HA SCRUTINY WHEN JUDGEMENT IS QUESTION HE GOES ON TO ARGUE THAT THE FAILURES AND OPERATION MIDLAND START AT THE TOP LEADING TO THE UNAVOIDABLE CONCLUSION BUT A CONTRACT EXTENSION WOULD BE TOO GENEROUS YESTERDAY REVIEW OF SCOTLAND YARD'S HANDLING OF A RAPE ALLEGATION AGAINST OR BRITAIN CONCLUDED
THAT INVESTIGATION WAS NECESSARY PROPORTIONATE AND PUT IT JUST ABOUT AN INVESTIGATION BY THE SUN AS EXPOSE WHAT THE PAPER CALLS A MIGRANT MISTER BIG IS ALLEGED TO HAVE SMUGGLED THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS INTO THE U.K. IT CLAIMS THE MAN WAS FILMED TAKING FOUR THOUSAND FROM AN UNDERCOVER REPORTER AS PAYMENT FOR TRAFFICKING THE SONS EDITORIAL ARGUES IT IS SHAMEFULLY EASY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO ENTER BRITAIN AND SAYS IT'S TIME FOR DAVID CAMERON TO STEP UP
AND DEAL WITH A MATTER OF URGENT NATIONAL SECURITY GUARDING CLAIMS THAT EXCLUSIVE DETAILS OF HOW EUROPEAN UNION OFFICIALS ARE DRAWING UP NEW LEGISLATION TO FORCE MULTI NATIONAL COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE THEIR EARNINGS AND TAX BILLS IN EUROPE THE DRAFT WHICH IS GOING TO BE PRESENTED IN APRIL AIMS TO MAKE FIRMS OPEN UP THEIR TAX ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE YEW GOVERNMENTS TO FULL PUBLIC SCRUTINY THE GUARDIAN SUGGEST INITIATIVE WILL ANGER WASHINGTON WHICH IS ALREADY ON THE WARPATH OVER WHAT IT PERCEIVES AS THE E.U. IS TARGETING A BIG U. S. DIGITAL COMPANIES IN ITS TAX INVESTIGATIONS
THE PAPERS ARE DIVIDED OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN REFORMS TO THE PRISON SYSTEM WHICH WE WERE JUST HEARING ABOUT ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT DAVID CAMERON WILL RIP UP DECADES OF CONSERVATIVE ORTHODOXY ON CRIME AND PUNISHMENT WHEN HE ANNOUNCES THE GREAT PROGRESSIVE CAUSE OF BRITISH POLITICS BUT THE MALE IS CONCERNED THE RADICAL PLANS WILL ALLOW THOUSANDS OF INMATES NEARING THE END OF THEIR SENTENCES TO LEAVE JAIL DURING THE WEEK AND SUGGEST THAT MY CAMERA'S LANGUAGE WILL MAKE SOME WORRY HE'S GOING SOFT
ON CRIME AND I'M AT THE HEADLINE MORONIC THE MIRROR SAYS SURVIVORS OF THE LONDON BOMBINGS OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE OF CRITICISE FILMMAKERS WHO BLEW UP A BUS OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT ACCORDING TO THE PAPER THE STUMP SPARKED PANIC THERE WAS NO PRIOR WARNING OF THE BLAST
THE MIRROR'S EDITORIAL ARGUES THE IDIOT TO MAKERS OF THE JACKIE CHAN MOVIE DESSERT TO BE HAULED OVER THE COALS FOR FAILING TO POST ADEQUATE WARNINGS APPLAUSE THE HOSTILE REACTION THERE WAS ON TWITTER TEACHING THEM THAT ALL PUBLICITY IS NOT GOOD PUBLICITY IT IS A QUARTER TO SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON WILL SET OUT PLANS TO OVERHAUL JAILS IN ENGLAND AND WALES SAYING THE FAILURE OF THE PRISON SYSTEM IS SCANDALOUS
THERE WERE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND SYRIANS FLAYING ALEPPO HAVE MASS AT THE BORDER WITH TURKEY THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES THEY HAVE KEPT THE CROSSING CLOTHES PRESENT NO ONE SAYS IF THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION FOR THE REFUGEES THEY COULD BE ALLOWED IN BUT FOR NOW TURKISH AID CONVOYS OF PROVIDING THEM WITH SHELTER AND FOOD ON THE SYRIAN SIDE
OF COURSE CALLED ON TURKEY TO ALLOW IN THOSE FLEEING PERSECUTION BUT IT'S ALSO PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ANKARA TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES WHO THEN MOVE ON TOWARDS EUROPE A TURKEY CORRESPONDENT MARK LEARN HAS BEEN MEETING SOME OF THE INJURED ARE BEING ALLOWED INTO TURKEY FOR TREATMENT
A FEW MINUTES DRIVE FROM THE GILLES BORDER CROSSING BETWEEN TURKEY AND SYRIA IS THE STATE HOSPITAL WHILE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES
HELD ON THE SYRIAN SIDE NOT ALLOWED TO CROSS THE HEAVILY WOUNDED BROUGHT HERE INTO TURKEY FOR URGENT CARE
ON THE BENCHES OUTSIDE THE MAIN ENTRANCE THERE ARE ROWS OF SYRIAN PATIENTS ONE MAN HERE HAS GOT A BANDAGE OVER HIS EYE AND WHAT LOOK LIKE SHRAPNEL WOUNDS ON HIS HANDS AND FACE JUST LOOK AT THE SMOKE A LITTLE
LIFTING UP HIS JUMPER NOW
THERE ARE PROBABLY ABOUT FIFTEEN SHRAPNEL WOUNDS ON HIS BACK HIS LEGS IS IT
WHEN DID YOU COME HERE TO KILL US CON I CAME HERE THREE DAYS AGO IN A RUSSIAN AIR A STRIKE HIT MY HOME THE WALL COLLAPSED ON TO MY HEAD SHRAPNEL HIT MY EYE
I'VE LOST IT FOR GOOD A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED IN THE STRIKE DO YOU THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION COULD BE PUSHED OUT OF A LEPER COMPLETELY THERE WAS HAD I SAID FORCES WONT BE ABLE TO TAKE A LA THOUGH ON THEIR OWN BUT WITH FRESH AND EIRE STRIKES YES EVERYONE INSIDE WILL BE KILLED BY SHELLING OR A STAFF LIKE IN MY BUYER THE RUSSIANS ARE DROPPING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED BOMBS A DAY
ONE OF THE HOSPITAL STAFF HAS JUST COME OUT TO TALK TO US HIS NAME IS MET MET
MISSION SHOULD'VE COMPRESSES THEM AS ON THE PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED TO YOU THERE AREN'T THREE SYRIAN OVER HALF OF THOSE WHO COME
MOST OUR OWN COUNTERS THEY'RE MISSING A LIMB OR N.I. YOU'RE ABLE TO COPE WITH THE NUMBERS YOU WERE IF THE BORDER IS OPEN THIS IS RICKY HE CAN COPE WITH ANYTHING
THE AMBULANCES TO SEE IF WE CAN GET INSIDE
OH
INTO A DIFFERENT PART OF THE HOSPITAL NOW GENERAL SURGERY
THERE'S A MAN HERE WITH A VERY BIG SCAR ON HIS LEG
NOMINATE ALEC LAUGH LAUGHY WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU TIM THOUGHT HELLO
AIR STRIKE IT A LEPER CITY I LAST MY NEED AND WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK AGAIN I GOT OUT OF THE CITY FIVE DAYS AGO BEFORE THE REGIME TOOK OVER THE MAIN ROAD TOWARDS TURKEY
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE FACT TURKEY IS NOT OPENING THE BORDER CLICKY DOGS AND TURKEY WAS OPEN THE BORDER BECAUSE FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE UNDER I'D RECITE CHILDREN OLD MEN AND WOMAN MANY OF THEM SLEEPING IN THE STREETS WITH NO SHELTER
BUT THE CROSSING REMAINS SHUT THE GATES OPENING ONLY TO TRUCKS DELIVERING VITAL SUPPLIES TO THE REFUGEES ON THE OTHER SIDE
TURKEY IS UNDER CONFLICTING PRESSURES TO HELP THOSE FLEEING DANGER WHILE ALSO BEING TOLD BY THE E.U. TO STEM THE FLOW OF REFUGEES GOING WEST
BETWEEN THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN SYRIA AND THE MIGRATION CRISIS IN EUROPE THIS COUNTRY IS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
THERE WE ARE IT IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN O'CLOCK HOW DO YOU MEASURE A DOG'S I.Q. ASSUMING OF COURSE THAT CHOOSING TO LIVE WITH JUSTIN WEBB OR EVAN DAVIES IS NOT A GOOD ENOUGH MEASURE OF ANY POOCHES INTELLIGENCE AND PERHAPS JUST AS IMPORTANTLY THE QUESTION WHY DOES WOULD YOU WANT TO WANT TO MEASURE A DOG'S EYE Q. WHAT DOCTOR ROSALIND ARDAN A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS HAS BEEN DOING IT AND GET OUR ANSWER THAT QUESTION
WHY DO WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE I.Q. OF A DOG STOP DROP WELL IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO KNOW IF A DOG'S COGNITIVE ABILITIES WERE STRUCTURED SOMEWHAT SIMILARLY TO HUMANS COGNITIVE ABILITIES AND THEIR DOGS TO SOME EXTENT TENDED TO BE GOOD AT THE THING TESTS IN GENERAL RATHER THAN JUST SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD BE INTERESTING HAS IT ANY VALUE
I THINK IT WOULD AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT OUR RESEARCH COS IT'S PROMISING THAT WE COULD REALLY TEST THIS RELIABLY AND VALIDLY IN HUMANS WE KNOW THIS INTELLIGENCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND HEALTH AND EVEN LIFESPAN
I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE FOR OTHER ANIMALS TOO SO WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THESE DOGS WE ADMINISTERED A RANGE OF TESTS TO THERE WE TESTED WHETHER DOGS THAT COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN QUANTITY ISN'T GO FOR THE LARGER ONE WITH THE DOGS COULD FINALLY HUMAN POINT IN WHERE THE DOGS COULD FIND THEIR WAY TO A HUGE TO SOME FOOD SHOULD YOU SPELL OUT A BIT HOW DO HOW DO YOU TELL WHETHER THEY CAN TELL A LARGE NUMBERS ABOUT ABOUT AMOUNT OF FOOD
O.K. DEFINITELY ABOUT FOOD SO WE PRESENTED THEM WITH TWO PLATES OF FOOD AND ONE HAD A SLIGHTLY SMALLER CIRCUMFERENCE OF SMEARED FOOD THAN THE OTHER AND THEN WE DID THIS A FEW TIMES AND WE SAW TO WHAT EXTENT TO DOGS RELIABLY GO TO THE LARGER SMEAR OF CIRCLES FOOD AND HOW DO YOU CHECK THAT HE'S NOT JUST AT RANDOM
WELL WE DO IT SEVERAL TIMES AND SO WE CAN SAY WHA WHAT WOULD BE CHANTS AND WHAT IS GRATED ENCHANTS SO WE FOUND THAT DOGS THAT WERE MORE ACCURATE WHERE QUICK AS WELL AND DO YOU IN THE END CONCLUDE THAT THERE ARE CLEVER DOGS OR CLEVER SPECIES OF DOGS BECAUSE ANY DOG OWNER WILL TELL YOU I'VE GOT SUCH AND SUCH THERE WELL KNOWN TO BE DA AFTER THEIR WELL KNOWN TO BE BRIGHT
YES WE ONLY TESTED WITHIN ONE GREED SO THAT WE DIDN'T CONFOUND LEG LENGTH WITH BRAINS SO WE JUST USE BORDER COLLIES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFAIR TO TEST A DACHSHUND AGAINST A GREYHOUND FOR EXAMPLE SO YOU NOW BELIEVE THAT DOGS LIKE HUMANS IF THEY'RE GOOD AT ONE TEST THEY'RE GOOD AT MULTIPLE TESTS THE RESERVE IF YOU LIKE SOME MEASURE OF I.Q. SO WHAT NEXT FOR RESEARCH
ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO REPLICATE IT JUST ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE STUDY SHOWING THIS IS TRUE SO WE WANT TO DO IT AGAIN AND BIGGER AND IS YOUR CONCERN TO HELP IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND THE HEALTH CARE OF ANIMALS OR ARE YOU THINKING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEARN ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS FROM THE BEHAVIOUR OF DOGS AND THE I.Q. OF DOGS THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE CARE OF ALL OF US ABSOLUTELY BOTH WE WANT TO ULTIMATELY WORK HER WAY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HEALTH
BUT ANYTHING THAT WE FOUND OUT THAT WILL HELP HUMANS WILL ALSO HELP DOGS TO LOOK AT THOSE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE AND HEALTH LATER ON IF WE GET THAT OPPORTUNITY DOCTOR ROSALIND ARDENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED I THINK SWALLOWING A SOCK DEREK OUT IF THERE'S A LITTLE KNIVES NOT BEING MASSIVELY BRIGHT I DON'T WANT TO INSULT YOUR DOG YEAH VERY INTELLIGENCE TEST OF THE LANDS OF ECONOMICS THERE'S COVER THAT TOFFEE
FOOLISH IN THAT RESPECT ANOTHER DOG'S MANY DOGS MANY DOG OWNERS A CONTACT IN THE ACTION WITHIN MORE EXTRAORDINARY THEY ONE OF SOLID FORTY THREE SOCKS BUT HE DOGS HAVE GOT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE EMAILING DOGS NOW ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH HUMANS AND ANIMALS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN BECAUSE HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRIDS
PHRASE THAT CONJURES UP ALL MANNER OF NASTY THINGS REALLY THE HOME OFFICE SAYS GOING TO SET UP A COMMITTEE TO REGULATE EXPERIMENTS IN THIS AREA BECAUSE EXPERIMENTS ARE OF COURSE DONE IN THIS AREA AND IT WAS SUGGESTED TO US THAT MANY OF THOSE EXPERIMENTS COULD RESULT IN VERY GOOD THINGS HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE IF NOT NOW TOM FILLED IN OUR SCIENCE EDITOR IS HERE YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS TOM I KNOW WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN DONE AT THE MOMENT
WELL THERE CERTAINLY IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS CONJURING UP ALL SORTS OF DIFFICULT IDEAS ABOUT DOC TOMORROW'S ISLAND OR ALL OF THE THE CHIMERA OF GREEK MYTHOLOGY BUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS WORK THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME ACTUALLY TO MAKE LABORATORY ANIMALS BETTER MODELS OF HUMAN DISEASE
AND WHEN I WHEN I SAID BETTER I MEAN THAT MIGHT BE BY ADDING SMALL AMOUNTS OF HUMOUR MATERIAL GENES TISSUE SO THAT FOR INSTANCE A MOUSE MODEL WHERE YOU'VE INTRODUCED SOME HUMAN LIVER CELLS TO THE MOUSE'S LIVER THAT MIGHT THEN BE A BETTER MODEL FOR FOR TESTING FOR FOR DEVELOPING NEW DRUGS AND TREATMENTS AND BATS OR SAY THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME AND HAS BEEN REALLY REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL AT HELPING TO UNDERSTAND DISEASE PROCESSES TO DEVELOP NEW DRUGS AND NEW TREATMENTS
BUT AS THIS SCIENCE HAS PROGRESSED AS IT'S BECOME POSSIBLE TO INCORPORATE MORE AND MORE HUMAN MATERIAL INTO THESE ANIMAL MODELS AND TO MORE SOPHISTICATED EXPERIMENTS
THAT'S REALLY RAISE THESE CONCERNS THAT AT SOME POINT THE SCIENCE IS GOING TO RUN UP AGAINST OR EVEN RUN ACROSS THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS PUBLICLY EXCEPT WITH WHAT KIND OF EXPERIMENT WHAT KIND OF PRAT WELL THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IF YOU LIKE MIGHT BE GROWING ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT IN PIGS OR SHEEP OR HUMAN ORGANS IN ANIMALS HOW IT QUITE YOU DO THAT HOW YOU'D WORK OUT THE SCIENCE LET ALONE WHETHER YOU WANTED
TO DO THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER EXPERIMENTS TO LOOK AT DISEASES LIKE ALZHEIMER'S OR PARKINSON'S WHERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO BRAIN MATERIAL TO AN ANIMAL MODEL AND EVEN A HIGHER PRIMATE A NON HUMAN PRIMATE NOW THAT'S GOING TO ENHANCE BRAIN FUNCTION AND THEN THERE'S AN ISSUE THERE ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE RICKY WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIMENTING ON AND HOW HUMAN YOU'RE MAKING AN ANIMAL IF YOU
FOR THE GOOD REASON OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALZHEIMER'S OR PARKINSON'S IS HE'S DEVELOPING IN THE BRAIN AND I SAID AT THE OUTSET THE HOME OFFICE GOING TO SET UP A COMMITTEE TO REGULATE ECZEMA AS IT IS IS THAT IT THE COMMITTEE WILL HAVE THEIR SAY SO YES YOU CAN DO IT NO YOU CAN'T YES IT WILL THE BELIEVE IT WE ACTUALLY THE BASIC LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS THIS KIND OF RESEARCH WAS ACTUALLY PUSHED PUT THREW IN A FREE VOTE IN THE COMMONS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT BUT THERE'S BEEN NO REGULATORY MECHANISM THAT'S EVER BEEN SET DOWN SINCE THEN
AND THE ACADEMY A MEDICAL SCIENCES WAS ASKED TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND PRODUCED A REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND IT SUGGESTED DIVIDING THESE EXPERIMENTS INTO THREE DISTINCT CATEGORIES AND CALL FOR THIS FORMATION OF A NEW COMMITTEE TO OVERSEE COORDINATE HIM AND APPROVE RESEARCH AND I UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE MODEL THAT'S NOW BEEN ADOPTED BY THE HOME OFFICE WHICH IS GOING TO WHICH HAVE OBVIOUSLY REGULATES ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS IN THE U.K. AND THESE PROPOSALS WERE DUE TO BE PUBLISHED IN JANUARY BUT HAVE BEEN HELD UP BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT
PUBLIC REACTION THE PRESS REACTION ABOUT FRANKENSTEIN SCIENCE HEADLINES BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A VIEW ON ISN'T IT NOT TO BE DISCUSSING WELL ABSOLUTELY MADE I DON'T THINK THIS CAN BE ANY DOUBT THAT THERE WILL BE OBJECTIONS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALWAYS SUBJECTED TO ANY KIND OF
WE KNOW THIS FROM FERTILITY SAYS ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES EMBRYOS OR GENETIC RESEARCH ON EMBRYOS WHETHER THEY'RE HUMAN OR ANIMAL YOU CAN SEE HOW SO THAT THOSE PEOPLE WOULD OBJECT TO THIS KIND OF THING AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CONTACT THIS COMMITTEE AND SAY OH ABSOLUTELY YES I THINK THE IDEA IS THIS COMMITTEE WOULD VERY MUCH OPERATE IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE RIGHT AND AND PEOPLE WOULD BE INVITED AND THERE HAS BEEN POLLING IN THAT SORT OF THING PEOPLE WOULD BE INVITED TO TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ON PHIL THANKS
IT IS NOW THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND BEN RICHES HERE WITH THE WEATHER MOTORMOUTH MORNING NICK THANK YOU STORM IMOGEN IS MAKING HER PRESENCE FELT THIS MONDAY MORNING WE HAVE A MET OFFICE AMBER BE PREPARED WARNING FOR WIND ENFORCER PARTS OF SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND SOUTH WALES COULD WELL CAUSE SOME DISRUPTION IN PLACES THERE'LL ALSO BE SOME HEAVY THUNDERY RAIN FOR SOME OF US AS WELL I'LL BEGIN WITH THE FORECAST ACROSS SOUTH WEST ENGLAND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THE SOUTHERN HALF OF WALES AND THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE MIDLANDS SOME VERY WINDY WEATHER HERE TODAY

IT WAS A SIMPLE DIPLOMATIC GIFT I THINK NO ONE IN NORTH CHINA AT THAT POINT WHAT MANGLES WERE SO HOW DID IT LEAD TO MASS HYSTERIA THE WORKERS WERE RELUCTANT TO TREAT THE MANGO FRUIT TO BE EATEN BUT RATHER ARSENAL GAVE GRAPHIC TO BE REVERED AND EVEN WORSHIPPED
BENJAMIN RAN EXPLORES THE STRANGE STORY OF MAO'S GOLDEN MANGOES EVEN IN SMALL TOWNS IN REMOTE REGIONS THOUSANDS WOULD TURN OUT TO WELCOME THE TRAVELLING MANGA
FRIDAY MORNING AT ELEVEN ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WANTED TO ASK YOU IN THE NEXT HOUR OF THIS PROGRAMME THE PROMINENT EUROSCEPTIC CHARLES MORE REPORTS ON THE ISSUE HE THINKS MATTERS IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR NICK ROBINSON AND JUSTIN WEBB
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING PRISON GOVERNORS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL HAVE GREATER CONTROL OVER HOW THEIR JAILS ARE RUN UNDER PROPOSALS FOR WHOLESALE REFORM BEING SET OUT BY DAVID CAMERON
A GAS PLANT WHICH WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY FOR TWO MILLION U.K. HOMES HAS BEGUN PRODUCTION IN THE SHETLAND ISLANDS THE PRIME MINISTER WILL SAY THAT MIGRANT CAMPS COULD APPEAR IN SOUTH EAST ENGLAND IF BRITAIN WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE B. B. C. NEWS READ BY DIANA SPEED
PLANS TO TRANSFORM THE PRISON SERVICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL BE SET OUT BY DAVID CAMERON TODAY HE'LL SAY HE WANTS TO GIVE GOVERNORS GREATER CONTROL OVER HOW JILL SPEND THEIR MONEY AND MAKE IT EASY TO COMPARE PRISONS PERFORMANCE BY PUBLISHING DATA SUCH AS REOFFENDING RATES AND THE NUMBER OF INMATES WHO FIND A JOB ONCE THEY'RE RELEASED MY CANNON WILL CONDEMNED THE FAILINGS OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM A SCANDALOUS AND SAY PRISONERS SHOULD BE TREATED AS POTENTIAL ASSETS RATHER THAN LIABILITIES HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
IT'S HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR A PRIME MINISTER TO TAKE SUCH A CLOSE INTEREST IN PRISON REFORM BUT DAVID CAMERON WANTS TO MAKE IT A GREAT PROGRESSIVE CAUSE IN BRITISH POLITICS HE BELIEVES JAILS ARE FAILING BECAUSE OF HIGHER REOFFENDING RATES AND LEVELS OF VIOLENCE DRUG TAKING AND SELF HARM WHICH HE SAYS SHOULD SEAMUS ALL
MY CAMERON WANTS GOVERNORS TO HAVE AUTONOMY OVER HOW PRISON SPEND THEIR BUDGETS AND WHICH EDUCATION SERVICES THEY USE THE IDEA WILL BE PILOTED IN SIX PRISONS THIS YEAR LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW SO THE PLANS FOR REFORM PRISONS AS THEY'RE BEING CALLED CAN BE ADOPTED MORE WIDELY THE HOWARD LEAGUE FOR PENAL REFORM SAID THE PRIME MINISTER'S VISION WOULDN'T BECOME A REALITY WHILE PRISONS REMAINED OVERCROWDED
THE FRENCH ENERGY COMPANY TO A TOWEL HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE FIRST GAS FROM A NEW FIELD OFF THE SHETLAND ISLANDS HAS BEGUN FLOWING TO THE MAINLAND IT'S BEEN THE LARGEST CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN THE U.K. SINCE THE OLYMPICS I BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT SIMON JACK REPORTS FROM SHETLAND
IT'S TAKEN FIVE YEARS TO BUILD AND COST THREE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS BUT FRENCH ENERGY GIANT HER TILE HAS TODAY CONFIRMED THE LACOMBE UM TOM OR GAS FIELD IS NOW DELIVERING GAS TO THE MAINLAND GAS IN THE SEABED ONE HUNDRED FORTY KILOMETRES NORTH OF THE ISLANDS IN TWO THOUSAND FEET OF WATER WILL MAKE ITS WAY HERE TO SHETLAND BUT ON TO SAINT FERGUS NEAR ABERDEEN WHERE WILL JOIN THE NATIONAL GRID AND EVENTUALLY CONTRIBUTE EIGHT PER CENT OF THE U.K.'S GAS NEEDS IT'S A BIG DAY FOR TELL AND THE ISLAND
BUT THE RECENT COLLAPSE IN ENERGY PRICES MUTED THE FANFARE AROUND THIS PROJECT PUBLICLY THE COMPANY IS SAYING THIS IS A LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND PRICES MAY WELL RECOVER THE PRIVATELY MANY ADMIT THAT AT CURRENT LEVELS THE INVESTMENT IS HARD TO JUSTIFY
WITH WEEKEND REPORTS PREDICTING THE LOSS OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OIL PLATFORMS IN THE NORTH SEA MANY WILL WONDER IF SHETLAND WILL EVER SEE THIS LEVEL OF INVESTMENT AGAIN
THE PRIME MINISTER IS EXPECTED TO SAY THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO PULL OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MIGRANT CAMPS LIKE THE JUNGLE IN CALAIS COULD APPEAR IN SOUTH EAST ENGLAND IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM ON E.U. MEMBERSHIP DAVID CAMERON OR SUGGEST THERE'S AN ARRANGEMENT FOLLOWING AND ALLOWING BRITISH BORDER GUARDS TO CHECK PASSPORTS IN FRANCE COULD BE SCRAPPED IN THE EVENT OF A VOTE TO LEAVE CRITICS HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF SCAREMONGERING AND POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON REPORTS
IT'S THIRTEEN YEARS SINCE THE BRITISH AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS AGREED THAT PEOPLE HEADING TO THE U.K. FROM CALAIS WOULD FACE CHEQUES FROM BRITISH BORDER GUARDS WHILE STILL IN FRANCE REMEMBER THOSE WITH NO ENTITLEMENT TO TRAVEL TO THE U.K. COULDN'T LEGALLY AT LEAST EVEN BOARDS THE BOAT OR TRAIN
NOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS PLANNING TO ARGUE THAT IF VOTERS BACK LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION FRANCE WOULD USE THIS AS AN EXCUSE TO SCRAP THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS MANY MIGRANTS WOULD NOT ENCOUNTER A BRITISH BORDER GUARD UNTIL THEY WERE ON BRITISH SOIL A SPOKESMAN FOR VOTE LEAVE ONE OF THE GROUP'S ARGUING FOR WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION SO THE CLAIM AMOUNTED TO THE HEIGHTS OF SCAREMONGERING ADDING THAT THE AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR E.U. MEMBERSHIP
SEARCH TEAMS ARE RESCUED TWO PEOPLE FROM A COLLAPSED BUILDING IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN MORE THAN TWO DAYS AFTER IT WAS TOPPLED IN AN EARTHQUAKE THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE DIED IN THE EARTHQUAKE MOST IN THE BUILDING AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED ARE STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR A CORRESPONDENT RUPERT WRINKLED HAYES SO THIS REPORT FROM THE CITY OF TIME

MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN CHILDREN ARE OFTEN NOT OBVIOUS A CHILD MIGHT BE WITHDRAWN OR LONELY AGGRESSIVE OR AGITATED BUT SPOTTING THE SIGNS AND OFFERING SUPPORT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN HELPING TO PREVENT DEEPER PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS DEVELOPING THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTING ONE POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS IN CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS AND WANTS EVERY SCHOOL TO HAVE ACCESS TO A COUNSELLOR
BUT A SNAPSHOT SURVEY BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS SUGGEST TWO THIRDS OF PRIMARIES IN ENGLAND DON'T HAVE A COUNSELLOR BASED ON SITE THE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE'S ROYAL PATRON OF THE CHARITY PLACE TO BE WHICH OFFERS SUPPORT TO SCHOOLS SHE HAS URGED THEM TO PRIORITISE THE EMOTIONAL WELLBEING OF PUPILS ALONGSIDE ACADEMIC SUCCESS

THE METROPOLITAN POLICE AS IT'S CONSIDERING DEPLOYING EAGLES TO INTERCEPT DRONES AMID CONCERNS AT THE DEVICES ARE INCREASINGLY BEING USED TO COMMIT CRIME THE FORCE'S INTEREST AND EMPLOYING BIRDS OF PREY AS CRIME FIGHTERS FOR THOSE TRIALS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHAT DETAILS FROM HARVEY COOK THE GROWING POPULARITY OF DRONES HAS ALREADY LED TO A NUMBER OF NEAR MISSES WITH AIRCRAFT THE REMOTE CONTROL DEVICES HAVE ALSO BEEN USED TO SMUGGLE ITEMS INTO JAILS AND THERE ARE FEARS THAT THEY COULD BE EXPLOITED BY TERRORISTS
THE COMMISSIONER OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE IS SUPPORTED BY THE TIMES TO HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY A VIDEO SHOWING AN EAGLE TRAINED BY DUTCH POLICE SWOOPING ON A DRONE GRABBING IT WITH ITS CLAWS AND TAKING IT DOWN
AS SENIOR OFFICER IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE NETHERLANDS TO SEE IF THE NEW FLYING SQUAD COULD WORK IN LONDON OR SCOTLAND YARD SPOKESMAN SAID THEY WERE INTERESTED IN ALL INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND WILL BE LOOKING AT THE USE OF BEAGLES BY THE DUTCH POLICE HARDLY COOK REPORTING THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE COMMISSIONER OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE IS UNDERSTOOD TO WANT TO KEEP HIS JOB AND HIS CONTRACT EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER BUT THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY HE IS NOT UP TO IT AND IN PARTICULAR HE'S CRITICISED FOR
TWO INQUIRIES INTO ALLEGATIONS OF HISTORICAL SEX ABUSE THEIR CLAIMS ABOUT LORD BRAMALL THAT WERE THEN CROPPED AND THE INVESTIGATION OF A RAPE ALLEGATION AGAINST THE LATE CALLED BRITTAIN LEON BRITTAN WHO DIED WITHOUT BEING TOLD THEIR CASE AGAINST HIM HAD BEEN CROPPED SIR BERNARD IS DUE TO APPEAR BEFORE THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE OF THE COMMONS HAD A COUPLE OF WEEKS' TIME THE FORMER CHILDREN'S MINISTER TO MORTON IS A CONSERVATIVE M.P. ON THAT COMMITTEE AND JOINS US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING JUSTIN WHAT DO YOU THINK SIR BERNARD NEEDS TO DO TO KEEP HIS JOB
IS AN APOLOGY ENOUGH DOES THAT MEAN THAT IN YOUR VIEW HE SHOULD THEN BE GIVEN AN EXTENSION OF HIS CONTRACT
MET APOLOGY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY JAMES VAUGHAN THE DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE OF DORSET WHO LOOKED AT THE INVESTIGATION INTO LEON BRITTAN AND SAID AMONG OTHER THINGS I'M A NUMBER ONE THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THE NUMBER TWO IMPORTANTLY THAT IT WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED TO YOU DO YOU ACCEPT THAT IT WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED
PLEASURE THE JOB YOUR COLLEAGUE NOW NIGEL EVANS ARE SAID THE VAUGHAN INQUIRY THE INQUIRY INTO WHAT THE METROPOLITAN POLICE WERE DOING WITH REGARD TO LEON BRITTAN WAS A WHITEWASH YOU WOULDN'T GUESS SO PARTS
POINT THOSE PEOPLE WHO IN THE FRENCH WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT IT WAS MANY MONTHS AND THAT'S BEFORE THEY'RE ACTUALLY AT HOME BUT THERE WERE NO LONGER BEING INVESTIGATED ALL THAT WAS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
BUT IT IS LIGHT WAS RED BUT THAT THEN COMES BACK THOUGH DOESN'T IT BUT THEY HAD MORE THAN AN APOLOGY ISN'T DOESN'T WHAT YOU'VE JUST OUTLINED SUGGEST THAT SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOUSE SHOULD NOT BE CARRYING ON IN THE JOB BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE FAILINGS OF OF THAT POLICE INVESTIGATION
BY THAT STAGE HE WILL HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING AND APOLOGISE PROPERLY TO BUT LORD BRAMALL WHO'S UNDOUBTEDLY OWED
THE REAL PERPETRATORS THEY HAD BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF THIS FROM ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL SEX CASES COMING BEFORE THE CASE IS COMING FOR THE C.P.S. ARE FIXED CASES ONE IN FIVE PRISONERS
IT WAS ALSO AN UNDERMINING THE CONFIDENCE WITH OTHER SURVIVORS TO COME FORWARD
WELCOME TO LOUGHTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH TONY DOES WILL BE TALKING TO JAMES VAUGHAN THE DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE OF DORSET AFTER DEPARTMENT WHO WERE LORD LAMONT AS ONE IT IS NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK IMMIGRATION IS ALREADY EMERGED AS A KEY BATTLE LINE IN THE FORTHCOMING REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THE REFERENDUM OF COURSE ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD REMAIN IN OR LEAVE THE E.U. THE PRIME MINISTER'S YOU HEARD IN THE NEWS TALKING ABOUT THE RISK THAT THE JUNGLE MIGRANT CAMP
WOULD BE FORCED TO LEAVE CALAIS AND COME TO THESE SHORES IN THE EVENT THAT WE LEFT IN YESTERDAY THE MANY FOUGHT HIM FOR THE LEADERSHIP DAVID DAVIS SAYING IMMIGRATION WOULD ACTUALLY GO UP AS A RESULT OF THE REFORMS THAT HE'S NEGOTIATING IN THE WELL IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE'RE GOING TO BE INVITING DIFFERENT PROMINENT PEOPLE FROM THAT SIDE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE DEBATE TO REPORT FOR THIS PROGRAMME ON THEIR VIEWS FIRST MARGARET THATCHER'S BIOGRAPHER THE COLUMNIST CHARLES MOORE
WE'LL TALK TO HIM ABOUT HER VIEWS AFTER EIGHT THIRTY BUT FIRST LET'S HEAR HIS ON THE ISSUE HE REGARDS AS SO CRUCIAL THAT ISSUE OF COURSE OF IMMIGRATION
I THOSE BORN HERE IN HASTINGS IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES BRITAIN WAS AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY BY JOINING WHAT IS NOW THE E.U. I BELIEVE WE LOST THAT BIRTHRIGHT IN THE COMING REFERENDUM WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO REGAIN IT
MY INSTINCT IS TO VOTE TO LEAVE BUT SOMETHING'S WORRY ME ONE IS IMMIGRATION IN MILLIONS ARE ON THE MOVE WE NEED MORE THAN EVER TO BE FREE TO CONTROL WHOM WE LET IN BUT ON THE OTHER HAND A MODERN COUNTRY NEEDS IMMIGRANTS I WANTED TO FEEL SECURE BUT NOT TO CUT OURSELVES OFF FROM THE WORLD
HOW CAN THE RIGHT CONTROL BE ACHIEVED COULD REFORM ITSELF TO MANAGE THIS ALL MUST WE DO IT ALONE AND WHAT IS THE REALITY OF MASS IMMIGRATION FOR OUR OWN PEOPLE AS THEY TRY TO MAKE A LIVING NOT ONLY IN BIG CITIES BUT HERE IN A POOR COASTAL TOWN LIKE HASTINGS THESE QUESTIONS ARE MAKING THEMSELVES
WANNA CUT IT ROUND THE SHRUBS AND SO I GET A NICE EVEN LOWER ALL THE WAY ROUND CUTTING TURF FOR A CUSTOMER'S FRONT GARDEN STUART TRICKLE RUNS A PROPERTY MAINTENANCE COMPANY EVEN FOR A BUSINESS IS BUILT UP A GOOD CUSTOMER BASE HE FINDS THAT YOU USE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF PROBLEM
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE FOUND IT IT'S AFFECTED US MORE OTHER COMPANIES HAVE BEEN TAKING
MORE OF THE FOREIGNERS AS THEY COME OVER THEY CAN PROBABLY CHARGE CHEAPER
THE MORE WE CAN SO YOU'RE HAVING TO CUT PRICES TO BE IN COMPETITION AND THESE ARE MAINLY POLES THING THE POLISHERS SORT I ESTABLISHED
NOW I THINK IT'S MORE U.K. ME ROMANIANS COMING IN AS WELL I THINK SHE'S FINDING IT HARDER AND HARDER WE'VE BEEN IN THE E.U. MOST OF YOUR LIFE ACTUALLY BUT THIS HAS BECOME MUCH MORE OF AN ISSUE I JUST AS THERE ARE MORE WORKERS FROM POOR COUNTRIES COMING IN DOES IT FEEL TO YOU AS IF THIS IS A SORT OF MAKE OR BREAK ISSUE WHEN THE REFERENDUM COMES ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD STAY OR LEAVE
WHEN THE REFERENDUM DOES COME I THINK IT WILL MAKE A MASSIVE IMPACT
WHERE WE WILL BE IN BUSINESS IF WE STAY IN THE E.U. IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE WE WILL STRUGGLE AND I THINK THE SMALLER BUSINESSES LIKE MYSELF
I THINK WE'LL GO OUT OF BUSINESS FOR ME I WOULD RATHER BE OUT THE WAY AND I THINK WE'VE GOT
SOME DEMOCRACIES HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION WITHOUT THE SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS WHICH PEOPLE LIKE STUART WILL FEEL
I ASKED JOHN HOWARD THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA HOW THIS CAN WORK THE STRIDE HERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A COUNTRY THAT EXCEPT AN IMMIGRATION WE'RE BUILT ON IMMIGRATION MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT THE GREAT MASS OF THESE DROWNING PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT CONTINUED IMMIGRATION AND GIVEN OUR HISTORY QUIET HIGH IMMIGRATION THEY WEREN'T REALLY MIND WHERE THEY COME FROM THAT REALLY
WHEN I THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S LOST CONTROL OF HIS COMING TO THE PLACE AND THEY SAY WELL IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL HIS COMING THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO SUPPORT MANY PEOPLE COME JOHN YOU'RE AN OLD FRIEND OF BRITAIN AND YOU KNOW AS WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS BIG DECISION THIS YEAR OR NEXT WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO US AS WE TRY TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS I CAN ONLY SAY
THAT I THINK I SPEAK FOR MOST OF MY FELLOW COUNTRY MEN AND WOMEN IN SAYING THAT CONTROLLING WHO COMES TO YOUR COUNTRY IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY SUPPOSE AUSTRALIA WERE IN THE SORT OF FEDERATION OR UNION THAT BRITAIN IS WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO PURSUE THE IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT YOU FEEL YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO BE I WELL THERE'S NAE DOUBT THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION CANNOT PURSUE AN INDEPENDENT MIGRATION POLICY THING SOME PEOPLE ARE
WELL THE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO PERSUADE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE A COLLECTIVE POLICY THAT MAKES SENSE WELL O.K. KAY TRY THAT THAT'S THAT'S A MATTER FOR THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE UNION BUT IF YOU WANT REAL INDEPENDENTLY CONTROLLED YOUR BORDERS YOU CAN SHARE THAT INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION WITH OTHER NATIONS BUT WHAT HAVE THE OPTION OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK
I WENT TO TALK TO MY OLD FRIEND RADIC SIKORSKI THE FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER OF POLAND AND HE BELIEVES THE ONLY SOLUTION IS A EUROPEAN
I REMEMBER AS A PART OF THE SHOWING HIM SIR AND WE DRAW EUGE INDIVIDUAL BENEFITS VIBE YOU KNOW
IT'S JUST VISAS BUT EVEN THOUGH I DIE DOC
FOR OUR SCHOOL NO WE'RE BROUGHT UP UNDER COMMUNISM
GETTING A PASSPORT TO GO ABROAD WAS A HUGE PRIVILEGE OF THE COMMUNIST AUTHORITIES THIS IS LIFE CHANGING
AND OF COURSE IT'S A SYSTEM THAT WE WANTED TO DEFEND AND WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE COUNTRIES SUCH AS OURS WHO ARE TAKING FAR MORE IN THERE
YOURS OBVIOUSLY AND WORRY ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD THINK OF AS A SOVEREIGN RIGHT WHICH IS TO SAY YOU CRUSH THE EXISTENCE
PROPERLY POLICED SHOGUN REGIME GIVES YOU DOUBLE PROTECTION IF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAME IN AN UNCONTROLLED MANNER INTO EUROPE SOME
ACTUALLY MAKE IT TO COLOUR AND BEYOND THE ONLY PROTECTION FOR BRITAIN IN THE SYSTEM WHICH YOU ENVISAGE IN ADMIRE BRITAIN CAN EXERCISE NO INDEPENDENCE
RIGHT IN THIS IF YOU WANT TO KIND OF RECOVERY OF CONTROL OVER YOUR NATIONAL BOARD AT THE SCEPTICS ARE TALKING ABOUT IT ANOTHER WAY
IF YOU WANTED TO LIMIT THE RIGHT OF YOUR CITY
TO TRAVEL AND WORK AND SETTLE IN BRITAIN
YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOT JUST THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT ALSO THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA INTO THE UNCHARTED WATERS
TRADE ORGANISATION TO HAVE THAT KIND OF CONTROL WELL I CAN SEE WHY POLES WITH A TERRIBLE HISTORY OF INVASION BY GREATER POWERS LOOK TO THE EUROPEAN UNION TO PROTECT THEIR SECURITY
DAVID CAMERON'S DRAUGHTY YOU'LL ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK TRIES TO REACH A COMPROMISE WITH THE NEEDS OF COUNTRIES LIKE POLAND BUT THE AUSTRALIAN EXAMPLE IN WHICH ISLAND COUNTRY WORKS OUT ITS OWN RULES FOR ITSELF IS SURELY MORE RELEVANT TO BRITAIN THE APPARENT PARADOX IS THAT ONLY A NATION CONFIDENT OF ITS FREEDOM TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT CAN FEEL HAPPY ABOUT LETTING THEM IN AS LONG AS WE STAY IN THE E.U. WE LACK THAT FREEDOM
THAT CHARLES MOORE'S PERSONAL VIEW WILL BE QUIZZING HIM ON IT AFTER EIGHT THIRTY AND LATER THIS MONTH THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE ECONOMIST MAGAZINE'S ANNIE MINTON BED THOSE WE'LL BE REPORTING FOR US SHE BELIEVED THAT BRITAIN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE E.U. AND SHE'LL TELL US WHY ACCESS TO THAT EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET IS THE ISSUE WHICH MATTERS MOST TO HER
I'M NOT TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN NORTH KOREA HAS SUCCEEDED IN UNITING THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL NO MEAN FEAT THE COUNCIL DECIDED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THE LAUNCH OF A LONG RANGE ROCKET ON SUNDAY BY THE NORTH KOREANS WAS PART OF ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAMME AND SEEMS TO BE AN EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO FIRE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT ENEMIES INCLUDING OF COURSE THE UNITED STATES HERE'S THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UN SAMANTHA PART WHAT NORTH KOREA IS DOING WITH EACH OF THESE ACTS THESE ILLEGAL ACTS WITH EACH OF THESE LODGES
IS THE LARGEST THEMSELVES ARE ADVANCING NORTH KOREA'S CAPACITY TO ADVANCE ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME
THEY ARE NOT MERELY PROVOCATIONS WITH EACH ONE OF THESE ACTIONS THAT HE PURE CAME AS ONE STEP CLOSER TO ITS DECLARED GOAL OF DEVELOPING NUCLEAR TIPPED INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES AND WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT
ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN BUT TO GOWER IS CHAIRMAN OF THE ENERGY SECURITY INSTITUTE WHICH IS A THINK TANK IN BEIJING HE THINKS AMERICA NEEDS TO CHANGE TACK IF CHINA AND AMERICA ARE TO MOVE TOGETHER TO BRING REAL PRESSURE TO BEAR ON THE NORTH KOREANS
FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAVE YOU ESTATES TO GET ON TO THE SAME PAGE I THINK THEY NEED TO OVERCOME MAJOR DIFFICULTIES RECENTLY HAVE ESTATES GOVERNMENT IS AND INK SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
URGED TO CHIME OUT WHO WORK CLOSELY AND CO OPERATE FULLY WITH THE YOU'VE HAD ESTATES IN SOLVING THERE'LL BE CLEAR PROLIFERATION ISSUE PIETY P. O. K. OF THE OTHER HAND ARE FROM THE CHINESE FEEL AT LEAST THEY KEPT A VERY MIXED AND CONFLICTING SIGNALS FROM THE LAND THE STATES BECAUSE ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME THE SECRETARY OF DEFENCE AND CARTER PUT POORER MORE PRESSURE AND SENT THE U.S. NAVAL SHIP IN TO THE TWELVE
MY ALL TERRITORIAL WATER OF CHINESE ISLAND SOUTH CHINA SEA SO THIS ACTUALLY ERODES IF NOT DESTROYS ANY SEA INCENTIVE ON THE PART OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE UNITED STATES ARE ANY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL THERE STOOD UNDER A BURGER WHO IS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF NUCLEAR POLICY AT THE ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING FIRST QUESTION I SUPPOSE IF AMERICA WERE TO TAKE VICTOR GOWER'S ADVICE THERE DO YOUR BASICALLY PUT EVERYTHING ELSE TO ONE SIDE AND SAY TO CHINA WE WE WON'T OPPOSE THE OTHER AREA LET US WORK TOGETHER ON THIS DO YOU THINK IT WOULD WORK
I THINK I'D BE QUITE UNPALATABLE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS BUT THE FIRST ONE IS SIMPLY POLITICALLY UNITED STATES AT THIS TIME AND ITS ALLIES IN THE REGION SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN ESPECIALLY NEED TO BE DEMONSTRATING TO THEIR OWN POPULATIONS THAT THEY'RE TAKING THIS MATTER VERY SERIOUSLY AND ARE WILLING TO PURSUE A STRONG RESPONSE
AND THAT TO SOME EXTENT INCLUDES PRESSURING CHINA SO THE IDEA THAT SIMPLY THOSE PRESSURE TACTICS COULD FALL ENTIRELY BY THE WAYSIDE IN ORDER TO PURSUE MORE GOOD NATURED DIPLOMATIC OUTREACH TO CHINA EXCLUSIVELY IS I THINK
PROBABLY UNFEASIBLE O.K. GIVEN THAT THAT IS THE CASE
WHAT THEN REALISTICALLY CAN BE DONE BECAUSE WE SEEM TO REPORT WE REPORT ON THESE ON ON THE PROGRESS THAT NORTH KOREA MAKES ALONG ITS NUCLEAR TRACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND PEOPLE COME UP WITH OPPOSITION AGAIN AND AGAIN AT THE END BUT ACTUALLY THERE ISN'T MUCH THAT SEEMS TO BE DONE WHAT DO YOU THINK REALISTICALLY CAN BE
ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IS THAT SIMPLY
WERE TO LAY IN SOME RESPECTS IF OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO SLOW NORTH KOREA'S TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENT BECAUSE WENT NORTH KOREA HAS MANAGED TO DO IS PUT A LOT OF THE PROCESSES FROM MANUFACTURING IN HOUSE IN COUNTRY WHICH MEANS THAT THEY HAVE REDUCED DEPENDENCY UPON FOREIGN SUPPLIER FOR SOME OF THE COMPONENTS FOR THE NUCLEAR AND MUSCLE PROGRAMMES THAT THEY NEED
THE ALTERNATIVE HOWEVER WHICH THE U.S. AND SOUTH KOREA SEEM TO BE TURNING TO A ESPECIALLY IS TO PURSUE GREATER PRESSURE STRATEGIES IN THE FORM OF MORE GENERAL SANCTIONS ON ON TRADE AND FINANCE AND THAT IS WHERE THE FRICTION WITH CHINA IS COMING AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY ANY STRATEGY THAT ONE COULD ENVISION
FOLLOW AT THIS POINT IN TIME IS GOING TO HAVE A
CHANCE OF SUCCESS WHETHER THAT'S SIGNIFICANT DIPLOMACY OR GENERAL SANCTIONS BECAUSE WE HAD THE POWER THEY'RE SAYING WE CANNOT AND WE WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO GET NUCLEAR TIPPED INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES IN OTHER WORDS A MISSILE THAT COULD THREATEN LOS ANGELES HOW CLOSE ARE THEY DID DID DID THERE DO YOU
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A SEVERE LACK OF INFORMATION WITH REGARDS TO THE TEEPEE OH KAY'S PROGRESS IN THIS AREA WITH SATELLITE LAUNCH AS WE CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE CERTAINLY DEVELOPING THE ABILITY NOW TWICE IN A ROW TO PUT A SATELLITE INTO ORBIT WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT GOT THAT SATELLITE UP THERE AS FUNCTIONING AND TO SOME REASONABLE RELIABLE EXTANT
BUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE OUR RE ENTRY CAPABILITY THAT IN THE COURSE OF A NUCLEAR STRIKE COULD BRING A PAYLOAD BACK DOWN TO EARTH TO A TARGET WHICH IS ONE OF THE KEY ASPECTS OF THAT PROCESS IS A DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT QUESTION
AND A BURGER FROM SERVICES DID YOU THANKS IT IS SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN NOSE JOBS BREAST REDUCTIONS EYELID SURGERY ALL GROWING IN POPULARITY AND NOT JUST AMONGST WOMEN BUT AMONGST MEN TOO BECAUSE PLASTIC SURGERIES BEING HAD IN RECORD NUMBERS ACCORDING TO NEW DATA FROM THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION IF AESTHETIC PLASTIC SURGEONS THE CONSULTANT PLASTIC SURGEON RADGE EVE GROVER IS WITH US IN THE STUDIO AND COMPILED THE STATISTICS HOW BIG A GROWTH IN THIS IS A WE SEE
WELL WE'VE SEEN DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IN THE LAST YEAR BUT REALLY OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE PROBABLY SEEN A DOUBLING IN THAT TOTAL FOR SOMEBODY IN YOUR SORT OF JOB DO YOU SIMPLY SAY HOORAY MORE BUSINESS WELL ACTUALLY THIS IS WORRYING TO US BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS NOW BEING SEEN AS A COMMODITY
WHEREAS IN ACTUAL FACT IT'S A MEDICAL PROCEDURE WITH RISKS AS WELL AS BENEFITS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OUR ASSOCIATION HAS CAMPAIGNED FOR OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS IS IN FACT TO HAVE A BAN ON ADVERTISING BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE COMING FOR SURGERY NOW OR I ACTUALLY INAPPROPRIATE A SURVEY OF OUR MEMBERS DOWN THREE YEARS AGO SHOWED THAT THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF PATIENTS COMING REALLY SHOULD BE TURNED AWAY AND ARE BEING TURNED AWAY BY MEMBERS TURN AWAY ON WHAT GROUNDS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A MEDICAL REASON WHY THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE SURGERY FOR EXAMPLE
THEY'RE OVERWEIGHT OR THE DIABETIC PERHAPS THEY'RE SMOKING AND SOMETIMES THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY HAVE FROM SURGERY THERE'S NO WAY OF BEING MET WITH A BAN ON ADVERTISING HAVE MUCH IMPACT BECAUSE AWAY THIS FREE ADVERTISING EVERY DAY YOU OPEN A MAGAZINE YOU LOOK ON A T.V. PROGRAMME PLASTIC SURGERY WORK AS IT'S OFTEN CALLED IS SO COMMON AMONG CELEBRITIES THAN A SENSE THAT'S A KIND OF FREE ADVERTISING FOR YOUR INDUSTRY
I THINK THAT'S MADE PEOPLE HAVE LESS STIGMA ATTACHED TO HAVING COSMETIC SURGERY BUT SOME OF THE MARKETING PRACTICES THAT WAS REVEALED DURING THE REVIEW WHICH WAS PERFORMED TWO YEARS AGO ACTUALLY SHOWED THAT THERE ARE VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT ARE BEING TARGETED FROM THIS TYPE OF SURGERY FOR EXAMPLE OR DIVORCEES SOME CLINICS WERE RUNNING DIVORCE FEELGOOD PACKAGES AND I THINK IF WE LOOK AT LITERALLY SORRY
CHANGE THE WAY YOU LOOK COS MAYBE THAT'LL CHEER YOU UP IF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOCIALLY HE RECITES DRAMATIC AND ACTUALLY IF WE LOOK AT ADVERTISING IN PRESCRIPTION ONLY MEDICINES AND THIS IS BANNED SO IF YOU LOOK AT SUPPLEMENTS THEY HAVE BENEFITS BUT NO BUT THEY ARE LITTLE RISK MEDICINES ARE PERCEIVED TO HAVE RISKS AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE ADVERTISED IF WE LOOK AT THE SAME SITUATION WITH SURGERY SURELY FOR GOODNESS' SAKE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS RISKS AND THIS SHOULD THEREFORE BE BANNED IN THE SAME WAY THAT IN MEDICINE IS RAJIV GROVER THANK YOU US
TWENTY NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND ROB IS HERE WITH THE SPOT AND IT'S JUSTIN HELLO AGAIN WHAT MANCHESTER UNITED MANAGER LOUIS VAN CARLY'S CLEARLY LOSING PATIENCE WITH REPORTERS WE KEEP ASKING HIM ABOUT HIS JOB THE LATEST CONTEXT BEING A ONE ALL DRAW AT CHELSEA WITH THEIR FORMER MANAGER JUSTIN MARINE YO CONTINUALLY BEING LINKED WITH AN EVENTUAL MOVE TO OLD TRAFFORD A DALLAS FAN CARL WAS FRUSTRATED BY COST LATE EQUALISER FOR CHELSEA AFTER LINGARD HAD STRUCK BRILLIANTLY FOR UNITED BUT HE LOST HIS RAG WITH ONE REPORTER ASKING HIM WHETHER WE'D ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO UNITED'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE

WELL MEANWHILE DEFEAT AT BOURNEMOUTH WOULD'VE LEFT ARSENAL EIGHT POINTS OFF LEFT THE CITY'S MOMENTUM AT THE TOP OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE BUT THEY WON TWO ZERO SO IT'S JUST JUST FIVE POINTS AND IN THE SCOTTISH CUP IT WAS EAST KILBRIDE NIL CELTIC TWO BUT HEARTS TO THE BUNYAN TWO WE'LL HAVE THE ONLY MATCHES IN RUGBY UNION SIX NATIONS CHAMPIONSHIP WITH IRELAND SIXTEEN WALES SIXTEEN YESTERDAY'S RESULT IN DUBLIN SOMETHING OF A COMEBACK FOR WALES WHO ARE THIRTEEN NIL DOWN AT ONE POINT IS THEIR CAPTAIN SAM WARBURTON CREDITS WHILE HER MAKING OUT SHE'S LYING THERE BUT I'M GLAD THAT WE MANAGED TO CRAWL BACK INTO THE GAME
TO GET A DRAW OUT OF IT SO EVERY TIME WE COME BACK AND GO JOE I GUESS THAT'S NOT MISS NOT TOO BAD A CORRESPONDING ROBINSON'S ON THE MORNING IN SIXTEEN ALL DRAW WHATEVER WARBURTON SAYS THAT HAS TO BE UNSATISFACTORY DOESN'T IT FOR BOTH TEAMS REALLY
IT IS YES WHEN YOU THINK THAT FOUR OF THE SIX TEAMS NOW CAN'T WIN THE GRAND SLAM OF HAD THEIR FIRST ROUND MATCHES AND THAT MATCH IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING GAME BUT IT DIDN'T HIT THE HEIGHTS AND ALSO THERE'S AN INJURY TO DAN BIGOT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO WALES I THINK BOTH OF THOSE TEAMS WILL BE VERY VERY FRUSTRATED ALL THIS GOOD NEWS I SUPPOSE FOR ENGLAND WHO LEAD THE TABLE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF THIRTY SIX HOURS ON FROM THEIR WIN AT MURRAYFIELD HOW DO YOU REFLECT ON EDDIE JONES FIRST MATCH IN CHARGE
I THINK HE'LL BE VERY SATISFIED WITH IT BUT IT WASN'T A GREAT PERFORMANCE THERE THE POINT IS THAT COME THE MIDDLE OF MARCH AT THE END OF THE SIX NATIONS ENGLAND WILL BE A FAR BETTER TEAM THAN THEY ARE NOW HE SAID TWO WEEKS WHICH IS ACTUALLY ONLY SEVEN TRAINING SESSIONS
FROM THE WORLD CUP TO ACTUALLY LICK HIS TEAM INTO SHAPE SO OF COURSE HE WAS PLEASED THAT THE SET PIECE WORK THEY'RE ONLY TWO INCIDENTS WENT WRONG IN ALL THE SCRUMS AND THE LINE OUTS IT WASN'T GREAT IN THE LOOSE AND THE BACK DIVISION HARDLY CUT FREE BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WON AT MURRAYFIELD YOU CAN BUILD ON THAT HE'S FORTUNATE THAT HE GETS A GAME AGAINST ITALY THIS WEEK WITH THE TEAM
OR BE ABLE TO RUN FREE AND THEN HE'LL GO INTO THE FINAL THREE MATCHES SO ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T SENSATIONAL IT WAS A VERY SOLID START AND HE'LL BE ABLE TO BUILD ON THAT IN THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT NEXT FIVE WEEKS FOR HIM YES THE FINAL POINT YOU JUST TOUCHED ON THIS AND ON THEN BIGGER FOR EXAMPLE THE SECOND ROUND OF MATCHES AS YOU SAY COMES NEXT WEEKEND THEY ALSO BE SHORT RECOVERY TIME AHEAD OF THE FINAL ROUND FOR MATCHES IT'S A PRETTY BRUTAL SCHEDULE A SEASON ISN'T IT
IT IS BUT IF YOU THINK OF THE WORLD CUP THAT'S EVEN WORSE IF YOUR PLANE RIGHT THROUGH WITH MORE MATCHES IF YOU GET TO THE FINAL AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM AND HE'S ALSO FORTUNATE THAT IT'S GOT ITALY NOW THAT WILL GIVE HIM CHANCE TO PERHAPS MAKE TWO OR THREE CHANGES TO INTRODUCE THE PLAYERS YOU WANT TO SEE LATER IN THE TOURNAMENT
AND HE KNOWS THAT FRANCE AND ITALY NEITHER WILL BE WORLD BEATERS I THINK YOU'LL BE PRETTY PLEASED WITH WITH LIFE AT THE END OF THE WEEKEND IT ROBERTSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED SAID OF THE RACING TIPS AND MUSSELBURGH TWO O'CLOCK NUMBER ONE FAGAN WOLVERHAMPTON FOR TO NUMBER THREE HERCULEAN PRINTS

IN SOME AREAS YES BUT IN THE NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND THIS WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST THIRTY FORTY YEARS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOOD SENT LOTS OF ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE IN ABERDEEN AND THIS IS WHY WOULD A MEL OH WHATEVER OFFICERS A LOCAL INDUSTRY SO THEREFORE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF INDIGENOUS EXPERIENCE
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE HEADLINES ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OIL AND GAS PRICES I WANT YOU'VE LIVED AND WORKED IN THIS INDUSTRY IN THIS AREA FOR SO LONG
WHAT THE BORIN CONVERSATIONS PEOPLE THINKING OH MY GOODNESS ME WHAT
YES THERE'S A LOT OF THAT GOING ON WE'VE GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO ARE OUT OF WORK NO THAT WELL AND NEVER EVEN THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN OUT OF WORK IT'S A HARD DANGEROUS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A FEW OF THESE SLUMPS BEFORE LET'S HOPE THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE SLUMS AND EVERYTHING IS BACK ON TRACK AGAIN
THAT WAS DAVE WINKS THE TERMINAL MANAGER I'M JOINED NOW BY MALCOLM BELL COUNCIL CONVENOR FOR SHETLAND AND JUST THAT SUBJECT YOU CAN'T HAVE A PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE WITHOUT HAVING A MASSIVE IMPACT ON ISLAND OF TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE AT THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE HAD AN INFLUX OF THREE THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS OF THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS ON AN ISLAND
AS A POPULATION TWENTY TWO THOUSAND THAT'S A FAIRLY MAJOR IMPACT HAS POSITIVES AS WELL AS THIS BENEFITS IMAGE FOR EXAMPLE OF YOU
PERSON LOOKING TO BUY HER FIRST HOUSE OTHER THAN TO RENT IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT AS THEY'RE DIFFICULT TO GET TOURIST BEDS BUT THEN AGAIN IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE OUR TRANSPORT COMPANY THEN THERE'S BEEN BOOM TIME
ALSO THE SERVICE INDUSTRY SO IT'S HAD A BIT OF US IN THIS BIT OF IT BUT WE ARE VERY USE THE OIL INDUSTRY HERE WE HAD THEM BACK IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES WE HAVE ALONG PRETTY WELL TOGETHER BUT HOW LONG WILL THAT LAST OVER WITH JUST A TALKING THERE TODAY AND SOME PEOPLE HE SAYING SPIRIT NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE OUT OF WORK ARE BEGINNING TO WORRY ABOUT THERE ABOUT THEIR FUTURE AND YOU MUST SEE WITH PRICES AT THE MOMENT WE'LL LEVEL WE MAY NEVER SEE INVESTMENT IN SHETLAND OF THIS SCALE AGAIN
THE PRICE GOES UP AS GOES UP WE EXPECT WE'VE HAD OVER TO SEE HERE SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WE EXPECTED TO BE HERE FOR A TILL THE TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY FIFTY THE OIL TERMINAL WHICH WAS WHICH WAS BUILT IN THE SEVENTIES IS KNOWN EDEN PATTERN I DO REFURBISH SO EXPECT THAT THAT WILL TAKE PLACE AND CLEARLY SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE
THE OIL INDUSTRY WILL ADAPT BUT OF COURSE WE DO KNOW THAT EVENTUALLY OIL WILL GO THEN WHAT WILL BE HERE FOR EVER WE WILL BE BACK TO THE INDIGENOUS INDUSTRIES THAT WE'VE ALWAYS HAD FOR EXAMPLE TOURISM PROVISION IN THE SIEVE WHICH IN FACT IS HER BIGGEST INDUSTRY AND WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THE FUTURE DO YOU SEE THAT
YOU SEE THE EVIDENCE OF OF INVESTMENT DRYING UP AT THE MOMENT
NO AS I SAY I THINK THAT
SOMEONE IS COMING TO THE STAGE WHERE IT'S BEEN REFURBISHED IN THE LOT INVESTMENT AND THAT WE WOULD EXPECT BUT CLEARLY THAT'S GOING TO BE PERHAPS A SLIGHTLY MORE THAN WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED AND VERY QUICKLY DO YOU THINK SHETLAND HAS DONE WELL OUT OF THE OIL AND GAS AND RECEIVED A PEOPLE THINK THEY'VE GOT A FAIR DEAL AND THEY'VE BENEFITED FROM IT
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE NO THAT WAS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES BEFORE OIL ARRIVED AND I GUESS MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT'S BEEN A BENEFIT OH KAY WILL HAVE LOTS OF NICE SWIMMING POOLS LEISURE CENTRES AS AN ARTS CENTRE HERE FANTASTIC ROADS OR PAID FOR PARTLY FUNDED BY THE OIL AND GAS WEALTH WHICH HAS BEEN HERE OVER THE LAST FEW DECKER'S MALCOLM BELL THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED
AND THANK YOU TO YOU TIME SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EH WE SHOULD BRIEFLY MENTIONED THE SUPERBOWL WHICH HAPPENED YESTERDAY YESTERDAY EVENING IN AMERICA ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION VIEWERS ON TELEVISION IS CAUSE A MASSIVE SPORTING EVENT BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT IT WAS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION VIEWERS AROUND THE WORLD AND BECAUSE OF THAT THOSE HUGE HUGE SUMS BUT A SHELL THAT BY ADVERTISERS TO BE ABLE TO BUY A THIRTY SECOND COMMERCIAL IT'S FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
THE THIRTY SECOND THE MATCH ITSELF WERE A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT BUT A SURPRISE RESULT THE DENVER BRONCOS BEAT THE FAVOURITES THE CAROLINA PANTHERS TWENTY FOUR TEN AND ANOTHER SURPRISE TO BRITISH BAND OPENING THEIR HALF TIME CELEBRATIONS THE KEY MOMENT COLD

ASK WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSED REFORMS TO THE E.U. ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK WRITING IN THE TELEGRAPH HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE EXCELLENT LANGUAGE USED TO PROMISE IMPROVEMENTS TO COMPETITIVENESS BUT ARGUES WE'VE HEARD THIS KIND OF THING FOR A WHILE ON SOVEREIGNTY HE PRAISES DAVID CAMERON FOR DOING BETTER THAN EXPECTED IN SECURING A MOVE AWAY FROM EVER CLOSER UNION BUT GOES ON TO ASK HOW BANKABLE IS THIS AND COMMENTS

SHOW ARGUING THERE'S A REAL RISK OF A CAREER THREATENING ACCIDENT TIME THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER HURRAH STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE AND DOCTOR GILES FRASER PRIEST IN CHARGE OF SAINT MERRYN EWING TO GOOD MORNING JUSTIN
IF LIKE ME YOU'RE GOING TO MISS THE B.B.C.'S ADAPTATION OF WAR AND PEACE ON A SUNDAY NIGHT HERE'S ANOTHER ADAPTATION OF A MUCH SHORTER TOLSTOY STORY PERHAPS WORTH PONDERING FOR THE BEGINNING OF LENT WHICH STARTS ON WEDNESDAY IT'S CALLED THE THREE QUESTIONS
THERE WAS ONCE A KING WHO ASKED HIS ADVISERS A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS WHAT'S THE RIGHT TIME TO START THINGS WHO ARE THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO
HIS PREY SPOKE OF RELIGION HIS DOCTORS HAVE HEALTH AND HIS SOLDIERS OF WAR BUT DISSATISFIED WITH THESE ANSWERS THE KING TRAVELLED DEEP INTO THE WOODS TO FIND A WISE HERMIT WHO ONLY SPOKE WITH PEOPLE WHO ONLY SPOKE WITH SIMPLE PEOPLE LIVING HIS BODY GOD A DISTANCE AWAY THE KING PUT ON PEASANT CLOSE AND APPROACH THE FRAIL HERMIT WHO IS BREATHLESSLY DIGGING A HOLE BUT THE HERMIT DIDN'T ANSWER THE KING HE JUST SPAT ON HIS HANDS AND KEPT ON DIGGING
ALL OF A SUDDEN A STRANGE MAN WHEN OUT OF THE FOREST AND COLLAPSED IN FRONT OF THE KING WITH BLOOD POURING FROM HIS SIDE THE KING AND THE HERMIT CARRIED THE MAN INTO THE HOUSE WASHED AND BANDAGE HIS WOUNDS AND THEN THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP
WHEN THE KING WOKE UP IN THE MORNING THE STRANGE MAN WAS STARING INTO HIS EYES
DO I KNOW YOU THE KING ASKED FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE I CAME HERE TO KILL YOU THE STRANGE MAN SAID I CAME HERE TO TAKE REVENGE ON ALL THE WAYS YOU'VE ROOM TO ME AND AS I APPROACHED THIS COTTAGE YOUR BODY GOD RECOGNISED ME AND STABBED ME I'D HAVE BLED TO DEATH HOW DO YOU NOT SAVED ME SO NOW I'M IN YOUR DEBT I BEG YOU TO FORGIVE ME
THE KING WAS PLEASED HE'D MADE PEACE WITH HIS ENEMY BUT WE STILL WANT TO BE AN ANSWER TO HIS QUESTIONS SO HE RETURNED TO THE HERMIT AND DEMANDED TO REPLY LOOKING UP FROM HIS SPADE THE HERMIT SIDE
YOU DON'T GET IT DO YOU HE SAID TO THE KING YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR ANSWER
OH IT'S NOT WAR AND PEACE BUT IT'S A VERY LENTON STORY TYPICAL OF THE LATE TOLSTOY FOR THE LANTERN JOURNEY A JOURNEY OF SELF DISCOVERY BEGINS WITHIN A STRIPPING US DOWN OF OUR FINERY IT'S A JOURNEY IN WHICH ENEMIES ARE RECONCILED AND PIECES ESTABLISHED
TOASTER WAS NO FAN OF THE RUSSIAN CHURCH OR THEIR ESTABLISHMENT ANSWERS INDEED HE WAS EXCOMMUNICATED IN NINETEEN OH ONE BUT INCREASINGLY IN HIS OLD AGE HE FOUND WISDOM IN THE FOLK TEACHING OF THE POOR JUST AS THE RESTLESS CAMPER ZOOK OFF DID IN LAST NIGHT'S EPISODE OF WAR AND PEACE
FOR TOAST OI CHRISTIANITY WAS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS THE SIMPLE PREACHING OF NON VIOLENCE AND FORGIVENESS THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT LOVE GOD AND LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR AND IT WAS THIS TEACHING THAT SO INFLUENCED THE LIKES OF GANDHI WITH WHOM TOAST WERE REGULARLY CORRESPONDED
THE ANSWERS TO THE KING'S QUESTIONS WEREN'T CLEVER OR DIFFICULT HE DIDN'T NEED REPORTS OR SPECIAL ADVISERS ALL HE NEEDED WAS THE COURAGE TO CARE FOR THE THREATENING STRANGER AND TO RECOGNISE HIM AS A FRIEND AS NOT AS AN ENEMY THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR GILES FRASER
BUT I MUST ENTER WAIT DAVID CAMERON IS GOING TO SAY TODAY THAT HE WANTS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PRESENT SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO DESCRIBE THE CURRENT SYSTEM A SCANDALOUS HE SAYS HE WANTS MODERN MORE EFFECTIVE PRISONS HE WANTS TO BE A PRESENT GOVERNOR'S COMPLETE CONTROL HE'S PROMISED SIX NEW PRISONS ARE WHAT HE CALLS REFORM PRISONS TO BE CREATED THIS YEAR SO ALSO GOING TO SAY THAT HE NEEDS WE NEED AN URGENT RETHINK OF THE WAY PRISONS TREAT WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT OR WHO ARE NURSING NEWBORN BABIES
AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE USUALLY SENT TO A MOTHER AND BABY UNIT THERE ARE SIX OF THEM IN ENGLAND BABIES CAN STAY WITH THEIR MOTHERS THERE FOR UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE'VE SPOKEN TO A ONE EX OFFENDER SHE WAS AT HOLLOWAY PRISON FOR FRAUD SHE WAS ALLOWED TO GIVE BIRTH IN HOSPITAL AND THEN MOVED TO PETERBOROUGH PRISON SHE'S RELEASED NOW SHE SPOKE TO A REPORTER SHE WANT TIME IN A CAFE IN SOUTH LONDON AND STARTED BY DESCRIBING WHAT HE'D HAVE BEEN LIKE IN HOSPITAL
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CONTACT YOUR FAMILY UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY CONFIRMED LABOUR INITIALLY IT WAS JUST MYSELF
TWO ESCORTS ARE WITH ME
IF I NEED TO GO TO THE TOILET THEY WILL OBVIOUSLY FOLLOW ME AND FIND OUT
WHEN I WAS IN THE PROGRAMME WITH HIM BEING OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM BUT BUT IN THE SAME ROOM THE CURTAINS WERE DRAWN SO THEY WERE VERY MUCH PRESENT
THEY KIND OF GET NOTES IN THE HOTEL THEN SHE SHOULD BE TOUGH BECAUSE I'M NOT HIGH RISK THERE NORMALLY THEY'LL COST HE WOULDN'T
YOU GO INTO LABOUR
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU HAD THE BABY AND AFTER SEVEN DAYS WE WERE MOVED TO PETERBOROUGH VERY VERY NEW AND IT'S GOT A LOVELY KITCHEN DOWNSTAIRS THE ROOMS LOOK LIKE A UNIVERSITY
LIKE A DORMITORY LIKE REALLY SMALL AND WITH YOUR TOILET AND STUFF AND YOU HAVE THE SHOWERS ARE OUTSIDE SO IT WAS VERY PLEASANT VERY NEW LOOKING SO AND WAS VERY VERY BIG
AND WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO LOOK AFTER YOUR BABY WERE YOU ABLE TO WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN THEY HAD WOKEN UP SO YOU WERE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE OR BEEN WITH ANYBODY SO WHEN YOU GO TO SHOUT WAS YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THE BABY WITH YOU TO THE SHOWER IF YOU'RE HAVING A SHOWER YOU'VE GOT TO PUT IT
YOU'VE GOT TO SAY WITH HIM YOU CAN'T UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES LEAVE YOUR CHILD WITH ANYBODY DID YOU FEEL A SOLIDARITY BETWEEN YOU WHEN THE OTHER PRISONERS WHO ARE NEW MUMS AS WELL IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WOMEN WE WANT TO BASE AND THEN MUM'S AS WELL THAT PERSONALITIES SOMETIMES FAVOURITISM LIKE THAT LIKE THERE'S A LADY THAT'S BEEN THERE FOR A YEAR AND A HALF THE VERGE
STUFF I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW HER AND HER CHILD LIKE FAMILIES
THINGS WITHOUT GETTING DONE FOR HER MORE THAN THEY WERE FATHERS SO LITTLE
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU WILL TELL HER ABOUT THIS TIME OF HER LIFE WHERE SHE WAS BORN YEAH I WOULD DEFINITELY TELL HER THAT I'M DEFINITELY GOING
TALK TO HER ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I DID IN MY PAST THAT WEREN'T SO GOOD
AND HOW I ENDED UP IN THE SITUATION AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WERE SO THAT SHE DOES
CHOOSE THE SAME LIFE SO I CHOSE CONSIDERING THAT YOURS WASN'T A VIOLENT CRIME DO YOU THINK THERE COULD HAVE BEEN ALTERNATIVES DIFFERENT WAYS TO DEAL WITH THIS
I CAN IMAGINE SOME OF THE LISTENERS HEARING THIS AND THINKING SHE DONE WHAT SHE DONE AND SHE DESERVES WHAT SHE GETS AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT TO A CERTAIN DEGREE HOWEVER THE CHILD IS TO WIN
EVEN IF YOU'RE VERY PREGNANT THE CHILD INSIDE YOU BESTOW INNOCENT AND ALTHOUGH THEY SAY CHILDREN ARE NOT PRISONERS EFFECTIVELY THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE BEHIND BARS I THOUGHT WAS IF THEY COULD BE FOSTER WAS THEY COULD BE TAN
I DON'T THINK WOMEN SHOULD BE
IN FITTING WITH THEIR BABY I DON'T THINK ANY CHILD SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT IT WAS A FORMER PRISONER TALKING TO SIOBHAN TIE JULIET LION IS DIRECTOR OF THE PRISON REFORM TRUST AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU WERE BORN IN WIDEN WIDER IN JUST A SECOND BUT FIRST ON THAT QUESTION TO DOWNING STREET NOW SAYING AN URGENT RETHINK OF THE WAY PRISONS TREAT WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT OR NURSING NEWBORN BABIES IF THERE IS TO BE AN URGENT RETHINK WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT RETHINK WHAT LINE SHOULD BE SHOULD IT BE
WELL AROUND NINE THOUSAND WOMEN GO TO PRISON EVERY YEAR ABOUT HALF OF THEM HAVE GOT BABIES OR SMALL CHILDREN AND THERE ARE JUST A FEW BABIES THAT ARE KEPT IN PRISON
WHEN YOU SEE THAT YOU'VE GONE OUT FEELING THAT THERE MUST BE BETTER SOLUTIONS CERTAINLY IN GERMANY THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THE HOSTELS THAT THAT YOUNG WOMAN WAS DESCRIBING WHERE WOMEN ARE CURFEW WHERE CHILDREN CAN STAY WITH THEIR MUMS EVEN GO TO SCHOOL FROM FROM THERE AND THAT APPEARS TO BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND IS THAT THE DIRECTION YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING IN NOW COS YOU'RE GOING TO THE SPEECH AREN'T YOU GOING TO HEAR WHATEVER THAT'S RIGHT WELL IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE IN AND THAT'S A RECOGNITION I THINK THAT MOST WOMEN IN PRISON
HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF SERIOUS CRIME LIKE RAPE AND ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEN THEY'VE BEEN PERPETRATORS OF PETTY PERSISTENT OFFENDING THERE HAD TO BE BETTER WAYS OF GETTING WOMEN OUT OF TROUBLE AND STOPPING THAT CYCLE OF CRIME I I'VE ACTUALLY MET A WOMAN IN A PRISON IN MANCHESTER WHO WAS BORN IN THAT PRISON SORT OF THIRTY YEARS BEFORE
AND THAT SORT OF AWFUL CYCLE THE WIDER POINT
THERE ARE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ROUGHLY PRESENT AREN'T THAT WHAT CRITICS OF THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD SAY IS THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED ON YOUR WATCH IT IS JUST LUDICROUS TO BECOMING TODAY AND SAYING WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS AND THAT AND REFORM PRESENCE AND IT'S A SCANDAL I SUPPOSE IT HAS BECOME A SCANDAL WHILE YOU'VE BEEN PRIME MINISTER
THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE IS IT CERTAINLY DREW IT WAS CERTAINLY THINGS HAVE GOT PARTICULARLY WORSE OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS AND THAT'S BECAUSE STAFF HAVE BEEN CUT BY A THIRD OF THE BUDGET HAS BEEN SLASHED THAT'S DEFINITELY MADE THINGS WORSE AND WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY INCIDENTS OF SELF HARM A WEEK AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ASSAULT SOMEONE PRISONERS SOMEONE STAFF SO IT'D MAKE HER BODY SAYING TODAY
WELL IF IT'S GENUINELY PART OF A SOCIAL LEGACY PROGRAMME WHICH SOME PEOPLE SAY IT IS THEN IT'S REALLY WELCOME IT IS TIME A PRIME MINISTER GOT TOUGH HENRI CONVICTION RATES AND GOT TOUGH ON THE FAILURE RATE OF PRISONS OF COURSE IT IS MANY SCHOOLS OR HOSPITALS WHERE IN ESTATE THE WHOLE OF OUR PUBLIC SERVICES WOULD BE MILK BUT HE MUST HAVE SEEN THOUGH THAT THE OVERCROWDING WAS HAPPENING MY GOODNESS HAVE BEEN WARNINGS ON THIS PROGRAMME ALONE PEOPLE COMING ON AND INSPECTORS ARE PRESENT IN THE RESTAURANT SAYING THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR YEARS
HE IS JUST NOT CONCEIVABLE IS IT THEN YOU NOTICE ALL OF THAT STUFF GOING IT'S FAIR TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS IS TRUE OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS AS WELL A DIFFERENT STRIPES THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM AND OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF PRISON POPULATION IS DOUBLES BUT THE RHETORIC OF BEING TOUGH ON CRIME WHICH
PEOPLE MISCONSTRUE AS MEANING WE'VE GOT TO BUILD MORE PRISONS OR WE'VE GOT TO MAKE PRISONS MORE PUNITIVE WHEN ALL THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YOU CAN MAKE THEM MORE EFFECTIVE JUST TWENTY SECONDS OR SO THE IDEA OF GETTING PRESENT GOVERNOR'S COMPLETE CONTROL WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE CENTREPIECE GOOD IDEA
GOOD IDEA IT IF ALONGSIDE THE BETTER AND FEEL CHRISTENS PROGRAMME WITH GOVERNORS WITH MORE RESPONSIBILITY YOU'VE REALLY GOT PROPER OPTIONS FOR THE COURTS SO YOU'VE GOT THE COMMUNITY PENALTIES YOU'VE GOT THE TREATMENT OPTIONS YOU'VE GOT WAYS OF GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF ADDICTIONS IN NOT ALL THE SOLUTIONS LIE BEHIND BARS

ON SHETLAND THE PRIME MINISTER WILL SAY THAT MIGRANT CAMPS COULD APPEAR IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND IF BRITAIN WERE TO CHOOSE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND TWO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PULLED ALIVE FROM THE RUBBLE OF A TOWER BLOCK IN TAIWAN JUST TWO DAYS AFTER IT COLLAPSED IN AN EARTHQUAKE THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY DIANA SPEED
PLANS TO TRANSFORM THE PRISON SERVICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL BE SET OUT BY DAVID CAMERON TODAY HE'LL SEE HE WANTS TO GIVE GENEROUS GIVE GOVERNORS GREATER CONTROL OVER HOW JAIL SPEND THEIR MONEY AND MAKE IT EASY TO COMPARE PRISONS PERFORMANCE BUT PUBLISHING DATA SUCH AS REOFFENDING RATES AND THE NUMBER OF INMATES WHO FIND A JOB ONCE THEY'RE RELEASED MY CANNON WILL CONDEMNED THE FAILINGS OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM A SCANDALOUS AND SAY PRISONERS SHOULD BE TREATED AS POTENTIAL ASSETS RATHER THAN LIABILITIES HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANI SURE
IT'S HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR A PRIME MINISTER TO TAKE SUCH A CLOSE INTEREST IN PRISON REFORM BUT DAVID CAMERON WANTS TO MAKE IT A GREAT PROGRESSIVE CAUSE IN BRITISH POLITICS HE BELIEVES JAILS ARE FAILING BECAUSE OF HIGHER REOFFENDING RATES AND LEVELS OF VIOLENCE DRUG TAKING AND SELF HARM WHICH HE SAYS SHOULD SEAMUS
MY CAMERON WANTS GOVERNORS TO HAVE AUTONOMY OVER HOW PRISON SPEND THEIR BUDGETS AND WHICH EDUCATION SERVICES THEY USE THE IDEA WILL BE PILOTED IN SIX PRISONS THIS YEAR LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW SO THE PLANS FOR REFORM PRISONS AS THEY'RE BEING CALLED CAN BE ADOPTED MORE WIDELY THE HOWARD LEAGUE FOR PENAL REFORM SAID THE PRIME MINISTER'S VISION WOULDN'T BECOME A REALITY WHILE PRISONS REMAINED OVERCROWDED
THE FRENCH ENERGY COMPANY TO A TILE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE FIRST GAS FROM THE LAGGAN THEM TO MOORFIELDS HAS BEGUN FLOWING TO THE MAINLAND THROUGH ITS NEW PLANT ON SHETLAND IT'S BEEN THE LARGEST CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN THE U.K. SINCE THE OLYMPICS THE FACILITY SHOULD EVENTUALLY PROVIDE ENOUGH POWER FOR TWO MILLION HOMES AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT SIMON JACK REPORTS FROM SHETLAND
IT'S TAKEN FIVE YEARS TO BUILD AND COST THREE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS BUT FRENCH ENERGY GIANT HER TILE HAS TODAY CONFIRMED THE LAC UM TOM OR GAS FIELD IS NOW DELIVERING GAS TO THE MAINLAND GAS IN THE SEABED ONE HUNDRED FORTY KILOMETRES NORTH OF THE ISLANDS IN TWO THOUSAND FEET OF WATER WILL MAKE ITS WAY HERE TO SHETLAND BUT ON TO SAINT FERGUS NEAR ABERDEEN WHERE IT WILL JOIN THE NATIONAL GRID AND EVENTUALLY CONTRIBUTE EIGHT PER CENT OF THE U.K.'S GAS NEEDS IT'S A BIG DAY FOR TOE TELL AND THE ISLAND
BUT THE RECENT COLLAPSE IN ENERGY PRICES MUTED THE FANFARE AROUND THIS PROJECT PUBLICLY THE COMPANY IS SAYING THIS IS A LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND PRICES MAY WELL RECOVER THE PRIVATELY MANY ADMIT THAT THE CURRENT LEVELS THE INVESTMENT IS HARD TO JUSTIFY WITH WEEKEND REPORTS PREDICTING THE LOSS OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OIL PLATFORMS IN THE NORTH SEA MANY WILL WONDER IF SHETLAND
WILL EVER SEE THIS LEVEL OF INVESTMENT AGAIN THE PRIME MINISTER IS EXPECTED TO SAY THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO PULL OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MIGRANT CAMPS LIKE THE JUNGLE IN CALAIS COULD APPEAR IN SOUTH EAST ENGLAND IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM ON E.U. MEMBERSHIP DAVID CAMERON WILL SUGGEST THAT AN ARRANGEMENT ALLOWING BRITISH BORDER GUARDS TO CHECK PASSPORTS IN FRANCE COULD BE SCRAPPED IN THE EVENT OF A VOTE TO LEAVE CRITICS HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF SCAREMONGERING ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH REPORTS
NUMBER TEN WANT TO TURN THE DEBATE OVER IMMIGRATION IN THIS REFERENDUM TO THEIR ADVANTAGE HENCE THE WARNING IF WE PULL OUT THE MIGRANT CAMPS IN CALAIS AND ELSEWHERE WILL COME TO TOWNS ALONG THE SOUTHERN COAST OF ENGLAND THOSE CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE HAVE ATTACKED THE CLAIM AS PART OF WHAT THEY DUB
PROJECT FEAR BY NUMBER TEN TO SCARE VOTERS INTO STAYING IN THE E.U. THEY ALSO ARGUE THE ARRANGEMENT WITH FRANCE IS A BI LATERAL DEAL AND NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DOWNING STREET THIS MORNING SAID EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WOULD CHANGE HAVE WE LEFT THE E.U. INCLUDING THE WILLINGNESS OF THE FRENCH TO POLICE CAMPS LIKE THE JUNGLE
A WARNING BY NUMBER TEN IS PART OF A WIDER MOVED TO SHIFT THE FOCUS IN THIS CAMPAIGN TO ISSUES OF NATIONAL SECURITY WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE STRENGTH AND ABILITY E.U. MEMBERSHIP GIVES THE U.K. TO SHARE INTELLIGENCE STOP TERRORISTS FROM TRAVELLING AND ARREST SUSPECTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES

NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SANCTIONS FOR A DECADE ASSET FREEZERS TROUBLE BANDS AND FINANCIAL EMBARGOES HAVE ALL BEEN ATTEMPTED THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY IS NO COIN ON THE U.N.

A RECORD NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN BRITAIN UNDERWENT COSMETIC SURGERY LAST YEAR JUST OVER FIFTY ONE THOUSAND HAD SOME SORT OF PROCEDURE AND INCREASE OF THIRTEEN PERCENT ON TWENTY FOURTEEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THE INCREASE AMONG MEN OPTING FOR SURGERY WAS GREATER THAN AMONGST WOMEN BUT HAS THE DETAILS ALTHOUGH NINE OUT OF TEN PROCEDURES ARE CARRIED OUT ON WOMEN WITH BREAST ENLARGEMENT STILL THE MOST POPULAR OPERATION THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR AESTHETIC PLASTIC SURGEONS SAYS THE NUMBER OF MEN LOOKING TO HAVE THINGS LIFTED
TUCKED OR AUGMENTED HAS DOUBLED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WHILE FACIAL PROCEDURES ARE BECOMING MORE POPULAR IT'S LIKE POST SUCTION WHERE FAT IS SUCKED OUT TO MAKE THE PATIENT SLIMMER THAT'S GROWING FASTEST AMONG BOTH SEXES UP TWENTY PERCENT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT THE B. DOUBLE A. P. S. SAYS PEOPLE NEED TO REALISE PLASTIC SURGERY IS NOT A COMMODITY AND IF AN OPERATION GOES WRONG THE PATIENT CAN'T JUST RETURN IT TO THE SHOP
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SAYS IT'S CONSIDERING DEPLOYING EAGLES TO INTERCEPT DRONES AMID CONCERNS THAT THE DEVICES ARE INCREASINGLY BEING USED TO COMMIT CRIME THE FORCE'S INTEREST AND EMPLOYING BIRDS OF PREY AS CRIME FIGHTERS FOR THOSE TRIALS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHAT DETAILS FROM HARVEY COOK THE GROWING POPULARITY OF DRONES HAS ALREADY LED TO A NUMBER OF NEAR MISSES WITH AIRCRAFT THE REMOTE CONTROL DEVICES HAVE ALSO BEEN USED TO SMUGGLE ITEMS INTO JAILS AND THERE ARE FEARS THAT THEY COULD BE EXPLOITED BY TERRORISTS
THE COMMISSIONER OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE IS SUPPORTED BY THE TIMES TO HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY A VIDEO SHOWING AN EAGLE TRAINED BY DUTCH POLICE SWOOPING ON A DRONE GRABBING IT WITH ITS CLAWS AND TAKING IT DOWN AS SENIOR OFFICER IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE NETHERLANDS TO SEE IF THE NEW FLYING SQUAD COULD WORK IN LONDON OR SCOTLAND YARD SPOKESMAN SAID THEY WERE INTERESTED IN ALL INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND WILL BE LOOKING AT THE USE OF BEAGLES BY THE DUTCH POLICE
HARVEY COOK REPORTING THERE IT IS TEN PAST EIGHT APOLOGISE ADMIT YOUR MISTAKES OR FACE THE SACK SO SAY THE CRITICS OF BRITAIN'S TOP POLICE OFFICER THE COMMISSIONER OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SIR BERNARD WHO CAN HOWL THEY CLAIM THAT THE METS HANDLING OF ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BY HIGH PROFILE INDIVIDUALS
HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF A TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE AND AN EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE ONE AT THAT FRIENDS OF THE FORMER HEAD OF THE BRITISH ARMY FIELD MARSHAL LORD BRAMALL AND THE FORMER HOME SECRETARY THE LATE LORD BRITAIN COMPLAINED THAT THEY WERE IN EFFECT DECLARED GUILTY AND THEN ASKED TO PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE SIR BERNARD WILL FACE QUESTIONING BY THE COMMONS HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SOON WE SPOKE TO ONE MEMBER OF THAT COMMITTEE TIM LOUGHTON EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME

AN APOLOGY LORD BRITAIN'S FRIENDS HAVE DEMANDED AN APOLOGY TO YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT HE DIED UNAWARE THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM CLAIM THAT HE'D RAPED HER NINETEEN YEAR OLD STUDENT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN HAD BEEN DROPPED NOW THAT'S JUST ONE REASON FOR THE ANGER THOSE FRIENDS FEEL ANOTHER IS THEIR BELIEF THAT THE METS PURSUIT OF LORD BRITTEN WAS DRIVEN BY POLITICAL PRESSURE IN PARTICULAR FROM THE MAN WHO'S NOW LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON THE OFFICER ORIGINALLY IN CHARGE OF THE INVESTIGATION
D.C.I. PAUL SETTLE TOLD M.P.S LAST YEAR THAT HE WAS ANGRY WHEN HIS JUDGEMENT NOT TO PURSUE THE CASE AGAINST LORD BRITTEN AND NOT TO INTERVIEW HIM WAS OVERTURNED
I SAW IT AS A BETRAYAL TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST BECAUSE I DON'T I THOUGHT THAT I'VE BEEN FRANK AND HONEST WITH HIM AND TRANSPARENT FROM THE OUTSET WE HAD IN VISITS OUR OFFICE WOULD HAVE HIM MEETS A TEAM
SO HE COULD GAIN CONFIDENCE IN WHAT WE WERE DOING AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE WOULD TAKE THE INVESTIGATION WHERE THE EVIDENCE LETTERS
WE WEREN'T THERE WITH AN AGENDA WE WERE THERE TO DO A JOB IT WAS AS SIMPLE AS THAT I KNOW I SAW IT AS A VERY LOW BLOW TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST MOST OF THE VOICES WE HAVE HEARD IN RECENT DAYS HAVE CRITICISED THE MET BUT WHAT AN IMPORTANT REPORT WAS PUBLISHED YESTERDAY WRITTEN BY JAMES VAUGHAN DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE FOR THE DORSET POLICE HE CARRIED OUT A REVIEW OF THE METS HANDLING OF THE BRITAIN CASE AND MISTER VAUGHAN YOU CONCLUDED THAT THEY HAD BEHAVED PROPERLY
MORE NET YESSITY YES EXONERATED PEOPLE SAY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR REPORT WHICH I HAVE ISN'T THE TRUTH YOU WERE ONLY LOOKING MERRILY INTO THE PROCESS OF HOW ONE PARTICULAR INVESTIGATION INTO LORD BRITAIN INTO ONE SPECIFIC ALLEGATION WAS CARRIED OUT NOT IN OTHER WORDS OVER AN OVERVIEW OF THE WAY ALL THESE CASES WERE LOOKED INTO
THAT'S RIGHT MY MY REVIEW WAS AROUND A SINGLE ALLEGATION OF A NON RECENT NATURE DATING BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AND MY TERMS OF REFERENCE ARE VERY CLEAR TWO TO REVIEW THAT INVESTIGATION THAT INVESTIGATION ALONE
WHAT DO YOU SAY THEN TO THE POLICE OFFICER WHO WE JUST HEARD FROM WHO REALLY ORIGINALLY DEALT WITH A CASE AND CONCLUDED THERE SIMPLY WASN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE AND THEN FOUND HIS JUDGEMENT OVERTURNED
POLICE OFFICERS ARE ASKED TO MAKE JUDGEMENT CALLS EVERY DAY NICK I'D REVIEWED THE INFORMATION ON THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO THE OFFICER WHO MADE THAT DECISION AND I'VE DRAWN A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION ON THE SAME INFORMATION BUT THE C.P.S. ALSO GAVE THEIR ADVICE THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE AND SAID RIGHT FROM THE OUTSET THAT THEY FOUND IT DIFFICULT ON THE BASE OF THE COMPLAINT AGAINST BRITAIN DIFFICULT TO SEE THAT ANY OFFENCE HAD BEEN COMMITTED
THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTAND IN SOME EARLY INVESTIGATIVE ADVICE WAS SOUGHT FROM THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE THEY THEY GAVE A SOME ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE THEY DIDN'T MAKE COMMENT DIRECTLY TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS THE CASE DO YOU THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE THAT THE CASE WAS REOPENED THAT THAT OFFICER WE HEARD FROM HAD HIS JUDGEMENT IGNORED AFTER THIS CASE HAD BEEN RAISED ON THE FLOOR ALLOWS COMMONS BY TOM WATSON
I THINK THAT THE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THE HOUSE BY TOM WATSON FOLLOW IN THE THE ALLEGED VICTIM IN THIS CASE RACE AND HER CONCERNS WITH HIM
I THINK IT'S RIGHT AND PROPER THAT A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT CAN BRING THOSE THOSE CAUSE FOR CONCERN TO THE HOUSE AND THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT THE CASE WAS REVIEWED AGAIN HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THE ORIGINAL POLICE OFFICER
WE HAVE YES AND HE WOULD MAKE THE CASE WOULDN'T YOU WOULD NEED THAT YOU NEED HARD EVIDENCE YOU DON'T JUST NEED AN ALLEGATION YOU JUST DON'T NEED WHAT NO DOUBT WAS TERRIBLE STORY FROM SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE A VICTIM YOU DO NEED HARD EVIDENCE AND THERE DIDN'T WASN'T MUCH OF THAT WAS THAT
YOU NEED HALF OF HARD EVIDENCE TO CHARGE PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL OFFENCES WHAT YOU NEED IN TERMS OF UNDERST OF CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION IS THERE'S AN ALLEGATION
ALLEGATIONS THESE DAYS ARE TAKEN SERIOUSLY TO IMPROVE IT AND CONFIDENCE AND BRINGING THESE ALLEGATIONS TO THE FOUR THAT THE ROLE OF THE PLACE IS TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY INVESTIGATE AND THOROUGHLY SICK TO FIND A FOR EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION THAT EITHER UNDERMINES OR SUPPORTS THAT SO THAT ALL THOSE ALL THOSE FACTS CAN BE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A FILE FOR OUGHT TO BE PRESENTED TO PROSECUTORS TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO CHARGE THIS EVEN YOUR OWN HIM FORGIVE ME
AND IN THIS CASE THE JUDGEMENT OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE WHICH I SO I SUPPORT IN MY REVIEW THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
SO YOU ENDED UP MORE OF THE MET ENDED UP YOU'VE ENDED UP PRECISELY WHERE THE ORIGINAL POLICE OFFICER BEGAN WHICH IS THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE THERE WAS VERY LITTLE PROSPECT OF ANY CHARGE BEING BROUGHT AND YET LORD BRITTEN DIED UNAWARE THAT THAT CONCLUSION HAVE BEEN REACHED AND NO APOLOGY HAS BEEN GIVEN TO HIS FAMILY DO YOU NOT THINK THAT OVERALL THIS HAS DISCREDITED THE METROPOLITAN POLICE
THAT STILL WITH THE THE THE QUESTION THEIR DECISION THAT WAS TAKEN RELATIVELY EARLY THE INVESTIGATION TO CLOSE INVESTIGATION AS I'VE SAID WHEN I REVIEWED THE SAME INFORMATION OF THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO THE DECISION MAKER I DREW A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION ABOUT IF I'VE BEEN THE SENIOR INVESTIGATING OFFICER I MAY WELL HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE INVESTIGATION TO BE TO BE MORE SATISFIED THAT THE CASE COULD BE CLOSED THE CASE WAS CLOSED BEFORE AN INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED WITH LAW BRITAIN MIGHT MY
CONCLUSIONS WERE THAT THAT WAS A PREMATURE POINT WHICH TO CLOSE INVESTIGATION
WELL LISTENING TO YOU AND I HOPE YOU'LL STAY ON THE LINE TO RESPOND TO HIM LISTENING TO YOU IS LORD LAMONT WHO IS A FORMER CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR OF COURSE AND CLOSE FRIEND OF LEON BRITTAN WHO IS A FORMER WAS A FORMER HOME SECRETARY WHAT DO YOU MAKE HER WHAT YOU'RE HEARING
WELL I THINK THE REPORT TWIST OF FAIRLY SKIMPY REPORT IS ONLY THREE PAGES LONG THE TERMS OF REFERENCE YOU HAD TO BE EVEN LONGER THAN THE REPORT I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH CONCERNED WITH PROCESS RATHER THAN
THE HARD FACTS OF THE CASE AND I THINK THE BRITTAIN FAMILY WILL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH THIS REPORT IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THERE IS EVIDENCE BUT AS YOU WERE HINTING THAT EVIDENCE HAS TO BE TESTED WHAT EVIDENCE WAS GOOD LORD BRITAIN HAD EVER MET EVER KNEW THE WOMAN WHO IS MAKING THE ACCUSATIONS DID THEY
TEST WHERE THE PLACE WHERE THIS ASSAULT WAS ALLEGED TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE AND WAS IT CREDIBLE THAT THAT WAS THE PLACE THAT THEY ALSO TOOK PLACE LET'S ASK HIM JAMES ONE IS ON THE LINE DID YOU TEST DID THE METRO ON POLICE ORIGINALLY TEST WITH LORD BRITTEN HAD MET THE WOMAN IN QUESTION ANNE HAD BEEN TO THE PLACE IN QUESTION
THERE'S TWO POINTS THERE NICK FIRST IS THEY'VE REPORT THERE'S BEEN PUBLISHED ON THE HUMBER FAIR SELECT COMMITTEE WEBSITE IS A SUMMARY OF MY OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSION HAS THE THREE BEDROOMS WHICH SHE'S THREE PAGES THEY REPORTERS AS DEALS WITH THE INFORMATION IN THE DETAIL IN MUCH MUCH FURTHER DE DECAY LET'S DO THE DETAIL THEY'RE NOW ON CAN YOU ANSWER LORD LAMONT'S QUESTION AND THE SECOND POINT IS THAT I'VE SUPPLIED A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT TO THE COMMISSIONER OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE
THE THE METROPOLITAN POLICE HAVE THEN WRITTEN TO THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE IN CONFIDENCE AND I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO COME TO TO GO INTO IT WOULD BE DRAWN ONLY FURTHER DETAIL ON THE REPORT THAT'S A MATTER FOR THE COMMISSIONER YOU DO KNOW THE ANSWERS THE MET NO THE ANSWER'S THE COMMITTEE KNOW THE ANSWERS BUT THE PUBLIC AREN'T LIKE THE WHAT WHAT ACCOUNTS EH NECK IS THAT I WAS SATISFIED ON THE CONCLUSION OF MY REPORT THAT THE INVESTIGATION UNDERTAKEN BY THE METROPOLITAN POLICE WHICH WASN'T PERFECT
BUT BUT THE INVESTIGATION THE UNDERTOOK A THOROUGH LET ME BRING HER MUM BACK IN I'M AFRAID COS OF YOU KNEW A LOT OF TIME AND HIM NOT SO MUCH LAUDANUM WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER POINTS MISTER VAUGHAN SAYS IT WAS PERFECTLY PROPER FOR MISTER WATSON TO ROAST IT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HIGHER GROUP AGREED IT WAS PURPOSEFULLY PROFFER HIM TO RAISE THE CASE I'M NOT SURE IT WAS PROPER FOR HIM TO RAISE IT PUBLICLY BUT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE THE ISSUE WAS HE KEPT ON PRESSING
WHY THE INVESTIGATION WASN'T CONTINUING WHILE OLD BRITAIN HADN'T BEEN INTERVIEWED THIS CASE WAS REFERRED FOR TIMES TO THE C.P.S. THAT SEEMS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY THING WHEN THE C.P.S. HAD CONCLUDED IT SHOULDN'T BE PURSUED FURTHER THEN YOU HAD THE EXTORTING BUSINESS OF SUGGESTING THAT LORD BRITAIN TOOK PART IN A DENTED TO PARADE HOW CAN I HAVENAE DENTED HIM PARADE WHEN THE PERSON WHO'S BEING ACCUSERS ARE VERY WELL KNOWN PUBLIC FIGURE OBVIOUSLY THE QUEUE'S SNOOPING WHAT HE HE HE LOOKS LIKE
I BELIEVE THIS LIST OF COMPLAINTS YOU HAVE IS SO SERIOUS THAT BERNARD WHO CAN SHOULD QUIT OR INDEED NOT HAVE HIS CONTRACT RENEWED BY THE HOME SECRETARY WHEN IT COMES UP SOON WHEN I THINK HE'S GOT TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS I THINK PERSONALLY HE'S GOT TO APOLOGISE AND YOU KNOW THERE WERE OTHERS SERIES HOW LOCATIONS AND AGAINST FRAUD BRITAIN BEYOND THIS CASE THE ONES THAT INVOLVED LORD BRAMALL AS WELL AND PEOPLE SEPARATE OPERATIONS YES BUT PEOPLE ARE RIGHTLY SAYING LORD BRAMALL IS OWED AN APOLOGY AND I THINK LORD BRITTEN IS OWED AN APOLOGY FOR BOTH OF THEM
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS ISN'T IT WHICH IS THE ESTABLISHMENT LOOKS AFTER ITSELF FORGIVE ME YOU'RE A FRIEND OF LAW BRITAIN AND THEN LORD BRITTEN WAS A FORMER WOULD IN THE PAST NO DOUBT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO HIS FRIENDS IN THE POLICE AND SO ON AND SO ON AND VICTIMS WHO ARE NOT WELL CONNECTED SIMPLY COULD NEVER COMPETE IF THERE HAD BEEN A PROPER CASE TO ANSWER THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS WEIGHT IF YOU LIKE OF ESTABLISHMENT ASSUMPTIONS THAT EVERYTHING'S FINE
WELL NO ONE IS SAYING EVERYTHING IS FINE NO YOU'RE SAYING FOR ONE MINUTE THAT THIS SHOULDN'T BE INVESTIGATED KNOW LORD BRITAIN WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW HE WOULD SAY IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BUT THE QUESTION WAS WAS THIS INVESTIGATED IN THE WAY ANY OTHER CASE WOULD BE INVESTIGATED OR WAS IT IN THE POST BUT AFTER SEVERAL WORLD PURSUED WITH VIGOUR THAT ACTUALLY GOT IT ALL OUT OF PROPORTION
LORD LAMONT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE JAMES VAUGHAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING THE TIMES TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT WE COULD HAVE A REAL BLOWOUT IN AMERICAN POLITICS TOMORROW AND ONE THAT MIGHT HAVE MESSAGES FOR US IN TERMS OF ELECTORS DISSATISFACTION WITH LIFE IN GENERAL AND EXISTING PARTIES AND CANDIDATES IN PARTICULAR THERE IS A REAL CHANCE THAT THE TWO WINNERS OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY THAT SECOND CONTEST TO WHITTLE DOWN THE PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS FOR THE DEMOCRATS AND THE REPUBLICANS WILL BE
DONALD TRUMP ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND BERNIE SANDERS
ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF FOCUS ON DONALD TRUMP WE THOUGHT WE'D FOCUS A LITTLE BIT MORE ON SENATOR SON SELF DESCRIBED SOCIALIST DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST FROM VERMONT KENNY REALLY SUSTAIN HIS CHALLENGE TO HILLARY CLINTON IN OTHER STATES COULD HE POSSIBLY WIN GYM REPORTS NOW FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE
BUT HE IS STICKER OH LOOK AT ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM BARNEY HERE WE GO A FIGHT FOR HEART
THEY KNOW I DON'T GET BURNED I DON'T GIVE UP I BELL IN THE ARENA AND I AM PREPARED TO MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT HAVE A WRAP OUR ECONOMY
THE DEMOCRATIC RACE IS ABOUT UNLOCKING THE PASSION BERNIE SANDERS THE SEPTUAGENARIAN SENATOR FROM NEXT DOOR HAS BROUGHT A RADDLE TACKLE ARMY TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY STUDENTS LIBERALS WANTING TO MATCH THE PASSION ON THE RIGHT SOME AGEING HIPPIES IT'S TRUE
PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT A SONG TO SAY
AN ASSAULT ON THE AMERICAN ELITE AND YOU SENSE A MYSTIFICATION AND HILLARY CLINTON HASN'T SHE BEEN DOING THIS ALL HER LIFE
I KNOW THAT I AM VIEWED AS A DIRECT THREAT TO THE FORCES THAT CALL A LOT OF THE SHOTS IN THIS COUNTRY
BUT YOU SEE PIE THE REASON I AM RUNNING IT WAS BECAUSE I HAVE STOOD UP AGAINST THESE FORCES I HAVE BEN ON THE FRONT LINES AGAINST THEM AND I'M STILL STANDING AND STILL TRYING TO BRING ME DOWN SO I'VE HIT THE SCROTE LET ANYBODY COULD EVER HAVE HER HAIR
ALL RIGHT AND YOU GET THERE SHE GETS BIG CROWDS AS EVER I WATCHED HER AT A COLLEGE TAKING QUESTIONS FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF MOVING IN AND OUT OF THE CROWD AND HAVING TO EXPLAIN WHY SHE THOUGHT SOME PEOPLE COULDN'T WARM TO HER I KNOW THAT THERE ARE VERY BIG BASE OF YOUNG VOTERS ARE AND THEY'RE NOT SUPPORTING ME AND I JUST WANT
ANY OF YOU KNOW AND OTHERS THAT YOU KNOW NOW KNOW THAT I'M SUPPORTING YOU I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS LIKE DAT FROM COLLEGE AND MAKING AFFORDABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND YOU KNOW
GETTING THE KINDS OF JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES BACK INTO OUR ECONOMY AND IT WILL PRIMARILY BENEFIT YOUNG PEOPLE AND THAT'S
BUT IT'S THE YEAR OF THE OUTSIDERS LOOK AT THE STUDENTS PUSHING BURMESE BANDWAGON HERE ON A WINTER'S AFTERNOON IN PORTSMOUTH BY THE SEA AND YOU REALISE THAT SHE WAS FIRST LADY BEFORE MANY OF THEM WERE BORN
ALL HAD EXPERIENCE UNRIVALLED IN EITHER PARTY IS UNDERSTOOD AND THEN SOMEHOW TAKEN FOR GRANTED
THANK YOU HE'S THE MOST HONEST AND HE SOON SANTA AUTO I BELIEVE IN WHY NOT HILARY I FEEL IS VERY REAL AND HILARY
MADONNA IS IT SOMETHING THAT IT'S NOT VERY APPROACHABLE YES I DON'T YOU AND THE WAY THERE SHE COMES ACROSS IS JUST VERY BOY
BERNIE HAS JUST KIND OF STOOD FOR THE SAME THING AS ANTHEA'S LIKE LITTLE NUANCES NEW ALL THE ISSUES SO I THINK JUST STEADINESS IS JASMINA HIM RATHER THAN
HE HAS UNLOCKED
BASH THE WALL STREET MOGULS REDISTRIBUTE WEALTH MAKE UNIVERSITY TUITION FREE GET THE YOUNG TO GO AND VOTE AND INVOLVE THEM IN A POLITICAL REVOLUTION NOTHING LESS IT'S AS IF THE REPUBLICAN ARGUMENT ABOUT BELIEF
AN IDEA OF AMERICA THAT PULSES WITH EMOTION NEEDS DAMMING ON THE OTHER SIDE IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS THEY'RE SAYING THE SAME THING LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS
TO REVITALISE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE POLITICAL PROCESS IS THE MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE
BY WHICH THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE FEEL DRAWN UP TOP AND WHEN WE DO THAT WOULD CHANGE
PORTERS WANT THAT VISION FOR A CHANGE BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN LATELY I HAVE BEEN LIKE SHOULD ON FOREIGN POLICY
THE MOST IMPORTANT FOREIGN POLICY ISSUE IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY
WAS THE WAR IN IRAQ I WAS RIGHT ON THAT ISSUE HILLARY CLINTON WAS RAW
OVERTURE TO A LONG DRAMA BERNIE SANDERS LOOKS AS IF HE WILL HAVE A BIG WIN HERE TOMORROW NIGHT BUT HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF THE BIG FIGURES AND HER PARTY THE NATIONAL ORGANISATION AND THE MONEY TO WIN MORE DELEGATES IN THE PRIMARIES AND COME OUT OF THE CONVENTION IN THE SUMMER AS THE NOMINEE
BUT IF IT IS SHE WHO FACES A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN THE AUTUMN LIFTED BY A CRUSADING CONSERVATIVE CAMPAIGN SHE MAY BE GRATEFUL FOR LESSONS FROM BERNIE SANDERS IN HOW TO TURN AN ARGUMENT INTO A MOVEMENT
BERNIE BECAUSE HE'S THE FIRST GUY TO COME ALONG THAT SEEMS TO BE MOVING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WHERE THE ECONOMICS OF THE WORLD INCLUDING
BIG BIG DRUG COMPANIES THAT SERVES CUP OF THOSE WORDS ARE RIPPING EVERYBODY OFF
ON THE AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO TOGETHER
IN THE PAIR FORWARD STARTS THIS TUESDAY IN HAMPSHIRE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
TO BE GIRLY IT'S LIKE
HE'S GOING TO TAKE IT ALL AWAY I REALLY
IF HE DID IT WOULD BE AS SURPRISING AS PRESIDENT
AND THAT'S WHY THE WORLD IS WATCH
JIM KNOCKED TEA THERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WE WILL HEAR MUCH MORE FROM HIM OF COURSE WHEN WE GET THE RESULTS EXCITING RESULT FOR SHOULD BE TWO ON WEDNESDAY MORNING AND WITH NEWS OF EXCITING RESULTS IN THE FOOTBALL AND OTHER THINGS IS ROB WITH THE SPORTS NEWS THANKS TAKE YES HELLO AGAIN MANSION UNIMAGINABLY FINE CARLY'S FILLING YOUR BACK PAGES AGAIN THIS MORNING THAT LOUIS LET'S RIP IS AMONGST THE HEADLINES AFTER ANOTHER SPIKY POST MATCH NEWS CONFERENCE IN WHICH HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE SPECULATION MAKING JUST SIMMERING HERE WITH THE OLD TRAFFORD JOB AND HE RESPONDED BY ASKING THE REPORTER ABOUT THE QUALITY OF HIS RESEARCH AND WITH THE HEAT
THE REPORTER WAS GOING TO BE SACKED JOE'S INJURY TIME EQUALISER IN A ONE ALL DRAW THAT WAS IRRITATED HIM BUT ARSON THEY KNOW THE ARSENAL MANAGER WILL BE PLEASED THAT HIS SIDE'S TUNA WIN AT BOURNEMOUTH DREW THEM ALONGSIDE TOTTENHAM IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE BOTH FIVE POINTS NOW ADRIFT OF THEIR LEADERS LEFT THE CITY AND ALAN SIXTEEN WELL SIXTEEN LEFT BOTH TEAMS IN THE MIDDLE OF RUGBY UNION SIX NATIONS TABLE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF MATCHES ISLAND HAD BEEN LEADING BY THIRTEEN POINTS TO NIL
WELL DONE THE BRONCOS TWENTY FOUR CAROLINA PANTHERS TEN WAS THE OVERNIGHT RESULT INSUPERABLE FIFTY THE MATCH IN SANTA CLARA CALIFORNIA SOMETHING OF A SURPRISE AS CAROLINA HAD ONLY BEEN DEFEATED ONCE IN THE WHOLE SEASON BY THE MATCH ITSELF WAS
WELL MISTAKE RIDDEN AND THEREFORE UNDERWHELMING THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD DENVER QUARTERBACK PEYTON MANNING A HOUSEHOLD NAME IN THE U.S. AND MAYBE EVEN IN SOME HOUSEHOLD HERE HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE HIS RETIREMENT BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED NOT NOW AT LEAST HIS FORMER TEAM MATE AND SUPERBOWL WINNER WITH THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS ROCKY BOYLAN THINKS IT'S IMMINENT

ROB THANKS START THERE WE CAN HAVE NOW ANDREW MARR IS ALREADY HERE WITH THE DETAILS MONEY USE INDEED MIND AND BODY MIND AND BODY IN SPECIFIC TERMS CAN WE USE A MENTAL POWERS TO CURE ILLNESSES AND SUPER CHARGED THE WAY WE LIVE OR IS IT ALL QUACKERY I'M JOINED BY A SCIENCE WRITER AND A GAMES EXPERT WHO WANT TO PERSUADE YOU WE CAN CONTROL OUR BODIES WITH OUR MINDS AS WELL AS BY A.C. GRAYLING
ON THE ORIGINS OF THE MIND BODY SPLIT BACK IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND THE DIRECTOR SIMON MCBURNEY WHOSE LATEST THEATRE WORK PLUNGES US INTO THE HALLUCINOGENIC AND MIND CHANGING DEPTHS OF THE AMAZON RAINFOREST IT IS ALL IN THE MIND OR IS IT JOIN ME TO THINK AFRESH ABOUT YOUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS ON START TO THE WEEK AT NINE ALL IN THE MIND OF ONLY YOU MIGHT SAY THANKS I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THAT TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE LOOK AT THE WEATHER SEVERE GALES IN THE SOUTH SQUALLY SHOWERS
RATHER KARMA ELSEWHERE YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO PHONE IT ROBINSON AND JUSTIN WEBB AND DIANA SPEED IS HERE WITH HER SOME EPPONNEE'S PRISON GOVERNORS WILL BE GIVEN MORE POWERS OVER THEIR BUDGETS AND A NEW GOVERNMENT PLANS TO SHAKE UP THE WAY PRISONS ARE RUN IN ENGLAND AND WALES DAVID CAMERON ALSO HE BELIEVES THE CURRENT PRISON SYSTEM IS FAILING BECAUSE OF HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE DRUG TAKING AND RE OFFENDING
THE FRENCH ENERGY COMPANY TO ATTILA'S ANNOUNCED THAT GAS HAS BEGAN TO FLOW FROM ITS FIELD OFF THE SHETLAND ISLANDS TO THE MAINLAND THE LAGGAN TO MOORFIELD IS EXPECTED TO SUPPLY EIGHT PER CENT OF THE U.K.'S GAS THERE'S A WARNING FROM DOWNING STREET THERE'S A VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD LEAD TO MIGRANT CAMPS SUCH AS THE ONE IN CALAIS APPEARING IN SOUTH EAST ENGLAND DAVID KAREN WILL SUGGEST THAT A BRITISH EXIT COULD LEAD FRANCE TO SCRAP THE AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWS U.K. BORDER CAN BORDER GUARDS TO CHECK PASSPORTS IN FRANCE
MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND HOMES IN SOUTH WEST ENGLAND HAVE LOST POWER AND STRONG WINDS AND HEAVY RAIN HIT THE REGION WIND SPEEDS OF MORE THAN NINETY MILES AN HOUR WERE RECORDED OFF THE ISLE OF WIGHT THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE WHEN INSULIN WAS DISCOVERED THE DOCTORS WHO DID IT INJECTED THEMSELVES WITH THIS LIFE SAVING HORMONE WHICH THEY EXTRACTED FROM THE FOETUS OF A CALF THEY SURVIVED INSOLENT WENT ON TO SAY
DOZENS HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF LIVES BUT THERE ARE PLENTY DANGERS INVOLVED IN MIXING UP HUMAN AND ANIMAL BODIES AND THIS PROGRAMME HAS LEARNT THAT THE HOME OFFICE IS TO SET UP A NEW COMMITTEE TO REGULATE SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRIDS THE NEW REGULATIONS WOULD OVERSEE SOME PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL RESEARCH SSH THE GROWING OF HUMAN ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT IN ANIMALS LIKE PIGS
OR ADDING HIGHER FUNCTIONING HUMAN NEURAL CELLS TO NON HUMAN PRIMATES TO STUDY CONDITIONS LIKE ALZHEIMER'S OR PARKINSON'S IN A MOMENT WE'LL TALK TO THE AUTHOR OF THE REPORT THE FORMS THE BASIS OF THE NEW REGULATIONS ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCE'S PROFESSOR MARTIN BARBARA BUT FIRST SCIENCE EDITOR TOM FIELD AND LOOKS AT THE SCIENCE BEHIND HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRIDS
THE SIMPLE SAUCERS PROBABLY MIGHT WANT TO DO IS TO UNDERSTAND THE PARTICULAR GENE BASIC EXPERIMENTS THAT INVOLVE ADDING HUMAN GENES OR TISSUE EVEN WHOLE ORGANS TO LABORATORY ANIMALS PARTICULARLY MICE AND RATS OH OF COURSE NOTHING NEW BUT THESE ARE VERY VALUABLE TO STUDY ALL SORTS OF ASPECT OF DISEASE
RESPONSE TO GROWTH ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND HAVE HELP RESEARCHERS LIKE THE FRANCIS CRICK INSTITUTES PROFESSOR ROBIN LOVELL BADGE
THAT'S TO GO TO HUMAN DISEASE PROCESSES DEVELOP AND TEST NEW DRUGS AND TREATMENTS THESE HAVE NO BEARING AT ALL ON THE ANIMAL LOOKS OR BEHAVES BUT GIVE US VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION
SO MAKING THERE'S WAITERS
BUT THAT'S THE TECHNOLOGY HAS PROGRESSED IT'S BECOME POSSIBLE TO ADD MORE AND MORE HUMAN MATERIAL TO ANIMAL MODELS
THAT'S ALLOWED SCIENTISTS TO DO INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED AND POWERFUL EXPERIMENTS BUT AT SOME POINT PROFESSOR LOVELL BADGE BELIEVES IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAND BACK TAKE STOCK SOME OF HIS
MIGHT GET VERY CLOSE TO OR EVEN CROSS OVER BOUNDARIES WHICH PEOPLE WOULD FIND VERY DISTASTEFUL OR AN EFFORT
SO WHAT SORT OF THINGS ARE WE TALKING YOU CAN IMAGINE A LOT OF THINGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO WITH US GROWING WHOLE HUMAN ORGANS IN ANIMALS
IF YOU WERE GOING TO TRY AND REPLACE A BIG CHUNK OF THE BRAIN THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT
DEFINITELY IF IT WAS A LONG NIGHT GOOD EVENING THIS IS SUSAN HUME AT WESTMINSTER THE BEN SEEKED LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK TO ALLOW RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRIDS WAS ACTUALLY SET DOWN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT GO AHEAD BUT TIME NOW MOONS REGULATES RE MECHANISM HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE
A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS IS CALLING FOR GREATER CONTROLS ON SOME RESEARCH WHICH INVOLVES IMPLANTING HUMAN CELLS INTO ANIMALS ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCE'S WAS OURS TO TABLE PROPOSALS AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN PUBLISHED A REPORT ANIMALS CONTAINING HUMAN MATERIAL THE DIVIDED EXPERIMENTS INTO THREE DISTINCT CATEGORIES AND CALLED FOR THE FORMATION OF A NEW COMMITTEE TO OVERSEE AND APPROVE OF RESEARCH TO SUPERVISE THE EXPERIMENT
I UNDERSTAND THE HOME OFFICE HAS NOW EXCEPTED THIS MODEL AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW REGULATOR THREE BODY WILL BE THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT'S ANIMALS IN SCIENCE COMMITTEE THE OXFORD ACADEMIC DOCTOR JOHN MANDERS BUT THERE ARE FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT HAS BEEN DELAYED OVER CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEGATIVE REACTION AND ACCUSATIONS OF FRANKENSTEIN SCIENCE
OH THAT'S TOM FAILED AND LET'S TALK TO PROFESSOR MARTIN BARBARA BARBARA'S CHAIR OF THE ACADEMY MEDICAL SCIENCES AND IS ON THE LINE UP MCCAMBRIDGE JUDY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TO YOU DO YOU DO YOU THINK THE HOME OFFICE GETTING IT RIGHT SO THEY SET UP THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE WILL THEN MAKE THE DECISION IS THAT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT
WELL MY UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T RELEASED THE DETAIL IN THE SEA BUT I'M ASSURED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO FOLLOW ROUGHLY THE QUITE CLOSELY THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE PUT FORWARD THE REASON FOR HAVING THIS JUDGED BY A VERY SENIOR COMMITTEE WHICH IS HAS MANY DIFFERENT SORTS OF SCIENCE REPRESENTED ON IT AS WELL AS NON SCIENTIST
THE REASON FOR DOING IT THAT WAY IS THAT THE SCIENCE IS MOVING SO FAST THAT IF YOU JUST TRY TO WRITE OUR RULES SAY YOU CAN DO THIS AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT THEY'RE BOUND TO BE WRONG SO I DO THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO AND WHAT KINDS OF THINGS MIGHT WE BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT DOING IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WE DON'T DO AT THE MOMENT
WELL THE AREA THAT'S GROWING VERY QUICKLY AT THE MOMENT DUE TO RECENT TECHNICAL ADVANCES IN MANAGING STEM CELLS AND EMBRYOS IS
CRYING TO GROW HUMAN ORGANS EVEN LARGER ANIMALS SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GROUPS IN THE U.S. GOOD TRYING TO DO SIGNAL STACK CREATE A HUMAN LIVER GROWING IN SAY A SHEEP SO THAT WIN THE SHEEP IS EVENTUALLY BUTCHERED YOU CAN GET IN PRINCIPLE AN ORGAN THAT IS MADE OF HUMAN SOULS AND SUITABLE FOR TRANSPLANT INTO A HUMAN BEING AND DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO THAT
WELL I THINK IT WOULD HAVE AN ENORMOUS MEDICAL IMPACT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO DO IT AND IT WAS SAFE AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS AND IT'S NOT EASY BUT I CAN'T SEE WHY WE SHOULDN'T AT LEAST TRY I THINK WE WOULD LEARN AN AWFUL LOT AND WE WILL DO AN AWFUL LOT OF GOOD I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IT IN AREAS LIKE THIS THEY ARE SENSITIVE THEY
DEFINITELY GIVE ONE A SLIGHTLY STRANGE FEELING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THAT THAT A GROUP OF US DECIDED SOME YEARS AGO THAT WE SHOULD DO WE SHOULD PRO ACTIVELY START TO LOOK INTO THIS AND SET OUT SOME GROUND RULES WHAT WILL WORRY
PEOPLE PARTICULARLY IS WHEN IT COMES TO TURN TO EGG OR SPERM CELLS WON'T HAVE THESE REALLY FUNDAMENTAL SELLS THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN ALTER AN ANIMAL IN A WAY THAT IN IN A SENSE MAKES IT SLIGHTLY HUMAN THAT'S PROBABLY OVERSTATING IT ISN'T THAT BUT THOSE THOSE AREAS WHICH WILL DEEPLY WORRIED
YEP AND I SHARE THE COMMENT YOU'VE JUST MADE WE ALSO RAN A BIG PUBLIC CONSULTATION EXERCISE AT THE TIME AND THE PUBLIC AND WE THE SCIENTISTS FELT MUCH THE SAME THE THREE AREAS THAT WE THOUGHT WE NEEDED TO BE LOOKED AFTER VERY CAREFULLY WHERE ANYTHING THAT INVOLVED CREATING HUMAN GERM CELLS FUNCTIONING IN AN ANIMAL ANYTHING THAT INVOLVED MESSING AROUND WITH THE BRAIN OF AN ANIMAL ALSO DID IT MIGHT ACQUIRE
SOME FORM OF HUMANNESS AND ANYTHING WHICH CHANGE THE ART WOULD APPEARANCE IN SOME WAY THAT MADE IT SORT OF ROCK PARTICULARLY HUMAN AND THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT WE SAID SHOULD NOT SIMPLY BE SUBJECT TO THE KIND OF REGULATION THAN ALL THAT LEVEL EXPERIMENTS OR A SUBJECT TO WHICH SHOULD GO THROUGH THIS INCIDENTALLY IT'S NOT A NEW AND DIFFERENT COMMITTEE THIS IS PUTTING THIS
THE SORT OF THING ON THE AGENDA AND ME MADE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HOME OFFICE'S MOST SENIOR ANIMAL ADVISORY CAPACITY WHICH IS THERE ANYWHERE
IS A FASCINATING AREA PROFESSOR MARTIN BARBARA THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE WE'LL HAVE MIGRANT CAMPS IN KENT SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER WARNING US THAT WE SHOULD NOT RISK LEAVING THE E.U. KNOW WE CAN ONLY CONTROL OUR BORDERS IF WE LEAVE THE SO SAID THE COLUMNIST FORMER DAILY TELEGRAPH EDITOR CHARLES MOORE IN THE FIRST OF OUR AUTHORED REPORTS AHEAD OF THAT REFERENDUM ON WHETHER TO REMAIN OR LEAVE CHARLES MOORE JOIN US ON THE LINE FROM SUSSEX MORNING TO YOU CHARLES
YOU YOU ARE OF COURSE JUST BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT YOUR VIEWS YOU ARE OF COURSE AS MANY PEOPLE KNOW MARGARET THATCHER'S AUTHORISED BIOGRAPHER SO WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE CLAIM BY HER FORMER FOREIGN AFFAIRS ADVISER CHARLES PAUL THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE SAID NO NO NO IF SHE'D STILL BEEN ALIVE SHE WOULD HAVE SAID POSSIBLY YES WELL MAYBE HE DON'T LIKE IT MUCH BUT WE'VE GOT TO STAY IN
MY JOB IS ALWAYS TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT MISSUS THATCHER DID DO AND THINK RATHER THAN TO SPECULATE ON WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE CHEF I'VE GOT A BIT OF COURSE I DID SHE DID BACK THE BIGGEST EXTENSION A MAJORITY VOTING EVER SEEN IN EUROPE LOSING PAIRS FOR THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT ON A SCALE NEVER BEFORE SEEN SHIT SHIT
SHE DID INDEED AND SHE CAME TO REGRET THIS AND SHE WELL WHOLE TIME SHE WAS IN OFFICE SHE SUPPORTED OUR MEMBERSHIP THERE WITH INCREASING LACK OF ENTHUSIASM AND AFTER SHE LEFT OFFICE YOU PRIVATELY
I THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO LEAVE AND TOLD ME THAT UNTIL THAT QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO YOU ARE CONFIDENT JUST BRIEFLY THAT SHE WOULD HAVE SAID GET OUT IF SHE WAS STILL ALIVE TODAY NO I I WON'T DO THE HYPOTHESIS I DON'T LET ON YOU'RE WRONG TO SPECULATE UNDERSTOOD YOU TOLD US WHAT SHE TOLD YOU IN THAT THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THAT'S FIRST HAND EVIDENCE IS NOT GUESSWORK IT'S NOT SPECULATION LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID SAY IN YOUR REPORT THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF AUTHORED REPORTS WILL DO FOR THE PROGRAMME YOU ESSENTIALLY ARGUED THAT IN ORDER TO CONTROL OUR BORDERS WE HAVE TO LEAVE THE E.U.
WHAT THOUGH RELICS OF COURSE HE SAID TO YOU FORM A POLISH FOREIGN MINISTER WHAT ABOUT THE EXAMPLE OF NORWAY WHAT ABOUT THE EXAMPLE OF SWITZERLAND COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT IN THE E.U. BUT WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE MARKETS OF THE E.U. AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR BORDERS OPENED TO THE E.U. AS WELL WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT
EVERY COUNTRY HAS TO HAVE IMMIGRANTS IN THE MODERN WORLD AND WE WILL HAVE QUITE A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS WHATEVER HAPPENS AND MANY OF THEM MUCH OF THAT WILL BE A VERY GOOD THING IF THE QUESTION IS WHO HAS THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY HERE AND IF YOU HAVE THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY THEN OF COURSE YOU COULD MAKE NEGOTIATIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ALL WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND YOU COME TO SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT
THE PROBLEM WITH WHAT WE HAVE AT PRESENT IT SEEMS TO ME IS THAT WE HAVE NO ULTIMATE AUTHORITY AND IN THIS RESPECT ON THIS SUBJECT THE GREATEST RECRUITING SERGEANT FOR THE LEAF CAMPAIGN IN THIS COUNTRY IS ANGELA MERKEL BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY THREW OPEN THE GERMAN BORDERS MOST EXTRAORDINARY ACTION AND OF COURSE THAT HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WHOLE OF THE REST OF THE UNION INCLUDING ULTIMATELY
BRITAIN LOOSER WHAT'LL ACTION IS SO ALARMING YOU SAY ULTIMATE AUTHORITIES TAKE THE SWISS IT IS TWO YEARS THIS WEEK SINCE THE SWISS PEOPLE IN A REFERENDUM VOTED TO CUT MIGRATION TWO YEARS ON THEY HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN CUTTING MIGRATION FROM THE E.U. BECAUSE THE BASICALLY SAYS THEM NO NO YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO HAVE FREE TRADE IN THE WAY THAT YOUR PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE THEM RICH AND ALSO SAY SORRY WE DON'T HAVE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE
OR DO YOU THINK HE'S A VERY DIFFERENT PROPOSITION IS A SMALL COUNTRY IT'S LANDLOCKED AND IT'S SURROUNDED BY MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE A MARITIME NATION IN AN ISLAND ONE AND WE TRADE ALL OVER THE WORLD I DON'T I DON'T THINK THE COMPARISON IS A VALID ONE DO YOU NOT THINK ON TRADE GROUNDS IT IS ON SIMPLY THIS WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF FREEDOM JUST FINISH THE THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT OF FREEDOM OF TRADE IS THAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MATCHED WITH FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM IT'S NOT TRUE
NO THAT'S NOT REALLY TRUE I MEAN WE HAVE VERY FREE TRADE NOT COMPLETELY FREE TRADE BUT WITH THE UNITED STATES AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND AND WE HAVE WORK PERMIT SYSTEMS AND VISAS AND ON WITH SUCH COUNTRIES HE SINGS ARE NOT EASY BUT THEY BASICALLY WORK I THINK WE COULD MAKE THAT WORK IF WE WANT IF THEY HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO LEAVE WE COULD NEGOTIATE A BETTER DEAL THAN THE SWISS OR THE NORWEGIANS
IS YOUR OBVIOUS WERE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT YES MUCH MORE IMPORTANT COUNTRY MUCH MORE POWERFUL COUNTRY YES AND THEREFORE BE POSSIBLE TODAY DOES IT WORRY YOU THAT IN A SENSE YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR A PRINCIPLE HIM AND YOU'RE QUITE CLEAR YOU WERE YOU CALLED IT A BERTH RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE WANT THE RIGHT TO CONTROL BUT IS IT HAPPENS VOTERS YOU OUGHT TO KNOW WE'D PROBABLY END UP LETTING A LOT OF PEOPLE IT ANYWAY COS IT MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE TO DO SO
IN THE PROGRAMME WE HEARD EARLIER THAT THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA JOHN HOWARD MADE THIS POINT HE HE MADE THE POINT THAT YOU CAN ELECT YOU CAN ADMIT A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS AND YOU CAN OFTEN BE RIGHT TO DO SO A LONG AS YOUR PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE YOU CAN CONTROL WHO COMES AND HOW MANY
AND WE LACK THAT CONFIDENCE AND THAT ACTUALLY MAKES US MORE ANTI IMMIGRATION AND WE SHOULD BE MORE ATTEMPTS AND FRIGHTENED DRAKE'S AUSTRALIANS HAVE TAKE OF A RISK TO TAKE A PRINCIPLE ISN'T IT
IT'S NOT A RISK FOR A PRINCIPLE IT SHITS FOR WHAT IT IS PARTLY BRUCE WAS ALSO A PRACTICE AND IT'S NOT A RISK WE EXPERIENCES FOR ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF OUR HISTORY WE KNOW HOW WE MANAGE THESE THINGS WITHOUT IT THE IDEA THAT WE'RE LEAPING IN THE DARK IT'S MUCH MORE OF A LEAP OF THE DARK I THINK TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS VERY UNCERTAIN SITUATION WAS SHOWING AND WITHIN THE E.U. TWO IN AN ERA OF MASS MIGRATION CHARLES MOORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US AND AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING IN THE PROGRAMME WE'LL HEAR AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW IN THE WEEKS TO COME
THE TIME NOW IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE SIMON'S BEEN IN SHETLAND TODAY ON THE DAY THAT TO TOWEL ANNOUNCED THAT ITS NEW FLAGSHIP GAS FIELD IS NOW OPERATIONAL AS NOT ANY OLD GAS FIELDS GOING TO PROVIDE EIGHT PER CENT OF ALL OF THE U.K.'S GAS NEEDS STILL THE U.K. THE INDUSTRY I SHOULD SAY THE GAS INDUSTRY NOT NECESSARILY IN THE BEST OF PLACES SIMON'S BACK ON THE LIMES YOU PROBABLY HEAR IN THE BACKGROUND MEMO SIMON
MORNING YES I'VE BEEN JOINED BY A SEAL JUST TO MAKE SURE I DON'T THINK A BUILDING IN THE BACKGROUND HERE IN THE PORT OF LOWICK LES I DON'T IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE FILM LOCAL HERO BIG MULTINATIONAL OIL AND GAS COMPANY FINDS OIL AND GAS NEAR THINLY POPULATED ISLAND AFTER A BIT OF A WING AND A ING DECIDE TO LET THEM GET ON WITH IT AND GENERAL PROSPERITY IN SEE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE STORY OF SHETLAND OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES YOU'D SEE THE TRAPPINGS OF THAT OIL AND GAS WEALTH ALL AROUND BEAUTIFUL
THIS BUILDINGS LEISURE CENTRES ART CENTRES ET-CETERA BUT THE ATMOSPHERE THE LANDSCAPE IS CHANGING I WENT TO FIND OUT UP GET PEOPLE TO REFLECT ON THE IMPACT THE OIL AND GAS THAT HAD ON SHETLAND
DICK KIND HAVE BENEFITED AND WAY JOBS AND STUFF BUT THAT GOES UP AND DOWN LIKE ROLAND REECE COS AT THE MOMENT WE SEE THE OIL AND GAS PRICES ARE PLUNGING AND JOB SITTING LONG BEFORE AND THAT KIND OF THING
IT'S IT'S OVER THE YEARS THAT IT'S THERE'VE BEEN FLUCTUATIONS BEFORE IS THE MOOD IN SHETLAND A POSITIVE ONE OR PEOPLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE HAPPENING WITH OIL AND GAS WELL YOU CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC FOR THE OPERA BEATS AND WAS KINDA OBVIOUSLY KIND OF PORTION OF SHAPE THINGS GO AND GREET THEM AND SAY THAT THAT'S WELL AT THE MOMENT NO ONE GUY A LOT OF PEOPLE BE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR JOBS BUT THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER SECTORS AS WELL
O.K. WITH THE FISH AND STUFF AS WELL SO IF THEY'RE GOING TO GET ON WITH THAT AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT
THAT WAS A LOCAL MUSICIAN MORRIS WHO I SPOKE TO LAST NIGHT I'M JOINED NOW BY SANDRA LAWRENSON IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE PORT AUTHORITY HERE IN SHETLAND WHAT PLANS WHEN YOU LOOK TO THE FUTURE DO YOU SEE FOR CHEF
THE NEXT THING WE ARE LOOKING TO DO HERE IN THE PORT AT LAD WITNESS HER FOCUS ON OFFSHORE DECOMMISSIONING BECAUSE THE MATURER FIELDS IN THE EAST SHETLAND BASIN IT'S VERY HEAVY CONCRETE THAN INFRASTRUCTURE
AND IT WILL BE A BIG TASK TO BE COMMISSIONED THOSE PLATFORMS WE'VE BEEN WORKING DOING THAT FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS
BUT INVESTING IN NEW QUAYSIDE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH
THE DECOMMISSIONING WHEN IT STABS IN THEIR NEST ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE PREPARING FOR THE DEMISE OF NORTH SEA OIL
IT'S A CONTINUAL EVOLUTION SUMMER THE FIELDS IN FACT HAVE BEEN REDEVELOPED
THE HYATT BOILED PLACE
BUT KNOW THAT THE PRODUCTION COST WILL BE UNECONOMIC WE EXPECT TO SEE DECOMMISSIONING ACCELERATING
AND SOME OF THE OLDER PLATFORMS THAT IT WON'T BE ECONOMIC TO MAINTAIN BEING MOVED BECAUSE HERE CARGO SHIP NOW DISA REVVING UP FOR THE TUG MADE ABOUT TO TAKE IT OUT IT WILL BE SAID THE OIL AND GAS IS NOT THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN IN SHETLAND THERE ARE OTHER INDUSTRY
THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE ISLANDS COMES FROM FISHING AND AQUACULTURE AND DEAL THE WE HAVE
FRESH PRODUCT SALMON AND WHITE FISH GOING OUT IN THE FERRY TO THE MAINS
AND THEN FOR THAT OR FEEL INTO THE CONTINENT PRESUMABLY THE SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ARE NOT HELPING IN THAT THAT HASN'T HELPED WITH MACKEREL WHICH USED TO BE A BIG MARKET IN RUSSIA YOU CLEAN AND OTHER
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WHERE IT'S A BIT OF THAT MIGHT HAVE A CHALLENGE BUT STILL AND FANTASTICALLY HEALTHY FISH STOCKS AND SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE PLENTY MORE FISH IN THE SEA FOR THESE A TIEBREAK SANDRA LAWRENCE AND MANY MANY THANKS AND AS I SAY IT'S A LOVELY DAY WITH THE SAILORS JUST JOINED US BY THE BY THE HARBOUR AND THEIR CARGO BOAT IS HEADING OUT TO THE MAINLAND I'LL BE GETTING ON A SIMILAR BOAT IN A FEW HOURS TIME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED SIMON TEN TO NINE AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IN THE PROGRAMME THE PRIME MINISTER IS WARNING THAT THE JUNGLE THE MIGRANT CAMP IN OTHER WORDS HIS CURRENT IN CALAIS COULD END UP APPEARING IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND WHY ARE YOU SO IS THAT A CREDIBLE CLAIM X. ASK ROB WIGHTMAN WHITEMAN WHO'S THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE U.K. BORDER AGENCY OR RATHER HE WAS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND JOHN'S ON THE LINE MORNING TO YOU MISTER WHITE
WHY ON EARTH MIGHT LEAVE YOU TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT IS AFTER ALL A BILATERAL TREATY BETWEEN BRITAIN AND FRANCE
WHY WHAT WOULD BE IN IT FOR THEM I MEAN OBVIOUSLY AT ONE LEVEL ALL THE TROUBLE MOVES TO THIS SIDE OF THE CHANNEL BUT THIS WAS ALL PART OF SORTING OUT THE SAME GAP CAMP IN THE PAST
VERY VERY VERY QUICK LAST ONE IF YOU COULD WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER CLAY MADE ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S PROPOSE BENEFIT CHANGES WILL ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE TO THIS COUNTRY COS IT TAKE TIME FOR THEM TO COME INTO OPERATION PEOPLE WILL CARMINE THERE'S LARGE NUMBERS AS THEY CAN IN ORDER TO CLAIM THEIR HIGHER BENEFITS WHILE THEY STILL EXIST WELL I THINK THIS IS A LOT LESS
ALL RIGHT SO I DO WHY DO YOU WE'RE SHORT OF TIME RUB OINTMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US THE TIME SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH GOT INTO HOT WATER WITH ITS OBITUARY OF SIR TERRY WOGAN'S SOME SAID IT WAS A FUSS ABOUT NOTHING BUT OTHERS COMPLAINED VERY TRENCHANT LATE THAT THE OBITUARY WAS AT TIMES DISRESPECTFUL PATRONISING MEAN SPIRITED
SIR TERRY WOGAN WAS THE MOST POPULAR AND BEST LOVED BROADCASTER IN BRITAIN INFECTING HER MIDDLE BROW OLD FASHIONED BRAND OF GENTLE IRISH WHIMSY THAT BARELY CAN
LOVED WHAT HE HAD BECOME BUT OFTEN FELT UNLOVED AND INSUFFICIENTLY CHERISHED AS WHEN HE AGREED TO PRESENT AWARDS TO THE CRAFTSMEN OF HIS TRADE FOR NO FEE MILLIE THE PRICE OF A ROOM WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT THE DEAL WAS JUST THAT HOTEL ROOM ONLY NO BREAKFAST
THE PRICE OF WHICH HE HAD TO PAY HIMSELF FROM HIS REPORTED EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND SALARY HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF BADLY DONE BY HOW DO YOU WRITE A GOOD OF BETRAY THEN OR BETRAY THAT TELLS YOU THINGS THAT DOESN'T OFFEND DOOR IS IT FINE TO OFFEND THE PEOPLE REALLY TOO TOUCHY AND ROSE HERE AS A BETRAYER EDITOR OF THE ECONOMIST AND SAYS MATTHEW BANNISTER PRESENTS THE LAST WORD ON RADIO FOUR MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING MORNING I IMAGINE YOU'RE NOT TOO FUSSED ABOUT OFFENDING
I'M NOT BUT IN A WAY I OPT OUT OF IT I CHEAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I DON'T SET MYSELF UP TO BE A JUDGE OF SOMEONE IN A BIT WHAT I DO IS GO BACK TO WHAT THEY'VE SAID ABOUT THEIR LIVES SO MY FIRST JOB IS TO GO AND FIND INTERVIEWS THEY'VE GIVEN NORA
ARE BIOGRAPHIES AUTOBIOGRAPHIES THEY'VE WRITTEN AND I TRY TO GET THEIR VIEW OF THE WORLD AND I TRY TO GET INSIDE THEIR HEADS AND RIGHTLY BITCHY FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW SO WHATEVER COMES OUT HE'S ACTUALLY WHAT THEY'VE SAID OF THEMSELVES AND IF THEY HAD DONE BAD THINGS THAT TENDS TO COME OUT TO AUTOMATICALLY ARE NATURALLY AND ODDLY ENOUGH IT ALTHOUGH IT CAN OFFEND PEOPLE I THINK IT'S ALSO
IT'S NOT AS HE'S NOT A JUDGEMENT BY THE OBITUARIES TO AND I THINK THAT IS QUITE IMPORTANT YOU AGREE MATTHEW BANNISTER I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO SPECULATE ON WHAT PEOPLE THINK THE ROLE OF AN OBITUARY IS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S LIKE A SORT OF OBI E. AND SOME KIND OF ACCOLADE TO GET AN EDITOR IN THE ECONOMIST OR ON RADIO FOUR OR WHATEVER I DON'T THINK IT IS THAT I THINK THE WORLD OF AN OBITUARY IS TO TRY TO PAINT A FULL AND VIVID PORTRAIT OF THE PERSON CONCERNED
WARTS AND ALL IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO THE TELEGRAPH OBITUARY WAS GOOD I CAN SEE WHY SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UPSET BY THE TELEGRAPH OBITUARY THE TONE OF THE TELEGRAM WOULD BE TRUE PARTICULARLY FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS AS WELL LOVED AS TERRY WOGAN BUT I THINK THAT THE HER BITTEREST WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO DO WHAT I WOULD TRY TO DO ON THE AIR WHICH IS TO GET BENEATH THE CLICHES THAT OCCUR WHEN SOMEBODY DIES TO TALK MORE ABOUT THEIR CHARACTER AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S A SERVICE TO EVERYBODY IF YOU CAN PAINT A PROPER PICTURE
OF WHAT SOMEBODY WAS LIKE RATHER THAN GIVING A SURFACE AND CLICHED VIEW PERHAPS IN SHOULD QUOTE PEOPLE THERE WHO ARE WILLING TO BE QUOTING AS ONE ONE LINE LOOKING INCREASINGLY BORED BY HIS GUESTS IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT PRISING STORIES OR INDEED MUCH OF ANY INTEREST AT ALL OUT OF THEM WASN'T HIS STRONGEST SUIT TO THE POINT WAS HE WAS A BIGGER STAR ON THE PEOPLE ON THE SOFA THIS IS IN THESE CHAT SHOW AND THAT UPSET SOME PEOPLE I'M AROUND IF IT HAD BEEN SOURCED PERHAPS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND IT'S A CATTY
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IT HAD BEEN SO AS TO I THINK BUT I STILL FEEL THAT YOU DO YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE CHARACTER WARTS AND ALL LEAD HIM GIVEN HIMSELF BUT HIS WARTS AND ALL IF YOU LIKE
I NOT CLEARER ABOUT HOW IT IS BEST TO DO THIS THING BUT
DO YOU OF COURSE I MUST ONE LAST WORD WE TALKED TO PEOPLE THEMSELVES AND WE HAD WITH TERRY WOGAN'S A BICKERING WE INTERVIEWED SOME OF HIS SCHOOLMATES AND I'D READ THAT TERRY WAS VERY GOOD AT RUGBY AT SCHOOL SO I SAID TO WANNABE SCHOOLMATES I GATHER HE WAS VERY GOOD AT RUGBY AND HE SAID HE WASN'T THAT COULD ACTUALLY SO BUT COMING FROM HIM IT WAS EXPRESSED WITH WARMTH WITH WEIGHTS AND OBVIOUSLY WE KNEW WHO WAS SAYING IT AND SO I DON'T THINK IT WAS
HURTFUL AND HE WENT ON TO SAY OF COURSE I WOULD YOU'D LOVE TERRY AND WHAT A GREAT INFLUENCE HAD BEEN IN HIS LIFE BUT I THINK SOME CRITICISM IS PERMISSIBLE PERHAPS AS YOU SAY PUT IN THE MOUTHS OF SOMEBODY WHO CAN STAND UP AND BE COUNTED HOW MUCH EASIER WHEN THE PERSON IS GENERALLY THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
A BAD PERSON AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME OBVIOUS OBITUARIES MIGHT YOU COULD BE AS UNPLEASANT AS YOU LIKE BUT THERE ARE SOME WHERE YOU CAN BUT I THINK ALL THE SAME IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHOW THAT THERE'S A HUMAN SIDE TO THESE MONSTERS AND CERTAINLY I'VE WRITTEN A BETRAYS PEOPLE THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR ONE OF A SEGREGATIONIST SHERIFFS IN SELMA ALABAMA
I DID HE'S A BIT TRUTH FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW AND WHEN I HAD HIM TALKING ABOUT NIGGERS NEEDING THE CATTLE PROD TO PUT IT IN QUOTES BUT THAT WAS HOW HE SAW IT HE WAS HANGING HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN ROPE IF YOU LIKE AND WE THEREFORE THAT WAS A WAY TO TO GIVE A JUDGEMENT ON HIM BUT NOT FROM THE OUTSIDE RATHER MORE FROM HIS OWN WORDS AND AND TELLS A STORY TO ME ON A SPECIAL PROGRAMME WE'VE BEEN MAKING FOR RADIO FOUR FOR NEXT SATURDAY CALLED THE ART OF THE OPIATE ABOUT THE REACTION SHE GOT WHEN SHE PROFILED OSAMA BIN LADEN
AND IT WASN'T THAT SHE HAD DONE THE PROFILE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS IT IT WAS THAT WAS PARTLY THAT TOO BECAUSE IF YOU SELL THE PROFILE THAT I KNOW IT HE'S A SORT OF ACCOLADES AN M.B.E. HE'S HAD TO DO AN EDIT AT ALL ESPECIALLY FOR AMERICANS SEEMS TO BE A PARTICULAR WHERE THE ENTERPRISE THAT'S RIGHT SIR PEOPLE OBJECTED TO THE VERY IDEA THAT THE VERY IDEA OF ONE BUT THEN AS MATTHEW WAS HER TELL YOU IT WAS A LITTLE PERSONAL THINGS ABOUT IT AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE HUMANISING SOMEBODY WHO WAS SEEN TO BE VILIFIED WAS OFFENSIVE PARTICULARLY TO YOUR AMERICAN READERS I THINK
AND THE POINT IS IT'S GOT TO BE INTERESTING HASN'T HAMMOCK AT THE PERSON SITTING I LIKE TO BELIEVE IT BUT BE INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERY HUMAN BEING IS INTERESTING I MEAN THE MAN WHO SWEEPS THE STREET AS INTERESTING EVERYONE TO MY MIND THIS WET THEIR INDIVIDUAL PAGE OF REMEMBRANCE
