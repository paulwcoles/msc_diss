WE WOULD SEE MIGRANT CAMPS IN KENT CAMERON THE SCAREMONGER IS THE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY MAIL ALTHOUGH IT DECIDES TO PUT THE WORD SCAREMONGER IN QUOTES THAT IS THE SENTIMENT IN ITS EDITORIAL AS WELL
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HAS THE HEADLINE FRANCE WE WON'T MOVE THE BORDER QUOTING NOT NEW COMMENTS FROM FRENCH MINISTERS BUT COMMENT MADE BACK IN OCTOBER BY BERNARD HAS A NERVE THE FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER WHO SAID THAT CALLING FOR THE BORDER WITH THE ENGLISH TO BE OPENED IS NOT A RESPONSIBLE SOLUTION HE WAS RESPONDING TO CALLS IN FRANCE TO CHANGE THE ARRANGEMENT WHICH EFFECTIVELY MOVED THE BORDER
FROM DOVER TO CALAIS AND THE SUN EDITORIAL ECHOES THE COMMENTS OF IT'S A FELLA EUROSCEPTIC PAPERS SAYING VOTERS WOULD PREFER ALMOST FAILURE TO CYNICAL WHOPPERS
THE MAIN STORY FOR BOTH THE TIMES AND THE GUARDIAN IS WHAT THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES THE THINK TANK SAID YESTERDAY ABOUT THE TURMOIL ON THE GLOBAL STOCK MARKETS AND HOW IT THREATENS TO LEAVE A TWO BILLION POUND BLACK HOLES AS THE GUARDIAN IN GEORGE OSBORNE'S DEFICIT REDUCTION PLANS THE GUARDIAN SAYS ON A DAY WHEN SHARE PRICES CRASHED IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES THE FIRST SAID THE PLAN TO PUT THE U.K. BACK IN THE BLACK BY THE END OF THE CURRENT PARLIAMENT WAS VULNERABLE TO A PROTRACTED
FINANCIAL MARKET PANIC AND THE TIMES HEADLINE PETROL RISE PETROL PRICE RISE IN PROSPECT BECAUSE THE IFE HAS ALSO SAID THAT THE CHANCELLOR MAY BE FORCED TO RAISE PRICES AT THE PETROL PUMPS IN ORDER TO MEET HIS ELECTION PLEDGE IT IS FREEZING FUEL DUTY HAS BECOME A CENTRAL PLANK OF GOVERNMENT POLICY UNDER THE CHANCELLOR BUT HE COULD BE FORCED TO LOOK AT RAISING IT TO FILL THE HOLE IN THE COUNTRY'S FINANCES
IT'S NOW TEN PAST SIX ALL WOMAN ACCUSED OF FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS BY HER EMPLOYER STARBUCKS AS IT HAPPENS HAS SUCCESSFULLY SUED ON THE GROUNDS THAT SHE HAD A DISABILITY DYSLEXIA CLIVE COLEMAN ALL LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAN TELL US MORE UNUSUAL CASE THIS GOT
IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE AS FAR AS PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM DYSLEXIA AS CONCERNED AS A SUPERVISOR AT STARBUCKS IN CLAPHAM IN SOUTH WEST LONDON MEASURE CALLED SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING THE TEMPERATURE OF FRIDGES AND WATER AT SPECIFIC TIMES AND ENTERING THE RESULTS INTO A DUTY ROSTER NOW SHE HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH READING WRITING AND TIME STARBUCKS KNEW ABOUT HER DYSLEXIA BECAUSE SHE TOLD THEM ABOUT IT
EVERY EMPLOYER HAS A DUTY UNDER THE EQUALITY ACT TO MAKE REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO HELP EMPLOYEES WITH A DISABILITY AND FAR FROM DOING THAT IN RESURRECTS CASE SHE WAS ACCUSED OF FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS AFTER MISTAKENLY ENTERING THE WRONG INFORMATION IN THE ROSTER SHE WAS GIVEN LESSER DUTIES SHE WAS ASKED TO RETRAIN SO SHE TOOK STARBUCKS TO AN EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL
ALLEGING DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION THE TRIBUNAL FOUND THAT STARBUCKS HAD FAILED TO MAKE THESE REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS FOR HER DISABILITY AND HAD DISCRIMINATED AGAINST HER BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF HER DYSLEXIA EITHER MISTAKEN ENTRIES IN THE ROSTER AND I'D ALSO FOUND THAT SHE HAD BEEN VICTIMISED BY HER EMPLOYER AND THERE APPEARED TO BE LITTLE OR NO KNOWLEDGE OR UNDERSTANDING OF EQUALITY ISSUES
IN A STATEMENT STARBUCK SAID THAT IT WAS IN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH HER AROUND SPECIFIC WORKPLACE SUPPORT AND THAT IT WAS COMMITTED TO HAVING A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE CAN WHICH YOU SPOKE EXCLUSIVELY TO ME SHE SAYS THE ACCUSATIONS OF LYING PUSHED HER TO THE EDGE THERE WAS A POINT THAT I WANT IT'S INSIGHT BECAUSE I'M NOT A FRAUD
THE NAME FRAUD ITSELF IT USED I SHOULD CAN EXIST FOR ME IS QUITE A SERIOUS CHAP SUCKING UP CRAIG YES I NEARLY COMPLETELY IN THE ME LIKE
BUT I HAD TO THINK WITH MY KIDS AND THAT THAT'S THE SORT OF WE MADE ME BOUNCE
TO REMIND HER THAT CLIP CLIVE ISN'T IT OF HOW SERIOUS THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED HAVE USED THIS PHRASE REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WAS BEING TALKED ABOUT IN THE TRIBUNAL WORK PLAY SUPPORT WHAT SORT OF THINGS DO THEY THINK IS NECESSARY FOR AN EMPLOYER TO DO IF THEY'VE GOT SOMEONE LIKE THIS LADY'S GOT DYSLEXIA
SURE WELL LOOK JUST VERY BRIEFLY JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM THE BRITISH DYSLEXIA ASSOCIATION SAY ONE IN TEN PEOPLE HAVE DYSLEXIA TO SOME DEGREE SO THAT REPRESENTS A HUGE CHUNK OF THE WORKFORCE THEY SAY THIS IS A BIG ISSUE OR MANY PEOPLE SIMPLY WON'T KNOW THEY HAVE DYSLEXIA BECAUSE IT WASN'T IDENTIFIED AT SCHOOL AND THE ASSOCIATION SAYS THAT MANY DYSLEXICS OF STRUGGLING IN THE WORKPLACE WITH VERY HIGH LEVELS OF ANXIETY BECAUSE EMPLOYERS SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE TRAINING OR THE AWARENESS TO MAKE THESE ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM
WHAT CAN HELP WERE FIRST OF ALL THE ASSOCIATION ITSELF WILL COME IN AND ASSESS AND ADVISE EMPLOYERS THINGS LIKE HAVING RECORDING DEVICES IN MEETINGS HELP WITH PROOF READING HELP WITH TAKING PHONE MESSAGES CAN REALLY ASSIST MEASURER CALLED SHE TOLD ME WHAT WOULD HELP HER TO WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY IF I'M DOING YOUR BANKING
LEAVE ME TO IT WE ME MAKE MAKE MISTAKES GIVE ME TIME TO GO BACK AND BACK TACK AT BECAUSE I CAN BACKTRACK IT EVENTUALLY IT BECOMES SUCH A PROTEIN HE'LL BECOME O.K. BECAUSE THIS THING BEING BEAMED
FASCINATING CASE CLIVE COLEMAN THANKS FOR JOINING US THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT IS WARNING THAT MORE SYRIANS ARE HEADING FOR THE BORDER BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES FLEEING THE BOMBING OF SYRIA'S LARGEST CITY ALEPPO BY PRESIDENT ASSAD'S FORCES AND THE RUSSIANS ARE REPORTER CELINE GARRITY'S ON THE SYRIA TURKEY BORDER AND HOW MANY YEARS TURKEY PREPARING FORCEFULLY
WELL WHAT'S THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NO MUM ACQUITTAL WHICH SADIE YESTERDAY WAS DRAMATIC ACTUALLY HE MENTIONED THAT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND REFUGEES COULD BE
IT'S TURKEY'S BORDERS HE SAID THIS COULD OF COURSE BE THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AS HE PUT IT BUT PEOPLE ACTUALLY WERE TALKING ABOUT HER COS PEOPLE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
ONE MILLION PEOPLE COMING TOWARDS TURKEY SO THERE IS THIS NUMBER IS GOING ON PROPER PROBABLY TO PREPARE THE TURKISH PUBLIC OPINION TO SUCH DRASTIC LEVELS OF AN INFLUX GOD SIXTY THOUSAND REFUGEES AND I THINK THAT THE TURKISH BORDER IS OF COURSE WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT AND THE ONES WHO ARE ALREADY THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM WHAT WHAT OF WHAT HELP IS THERE FOR THEM
WELL UM IT'S A CROUTON WISH ALSO PUT THAT NUMBER ALMOST DOUBLED MORE THAN DOUBLED THAT NUMBER THE NUMBER WAS AT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND YESTERDAY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER SAID THE CERIUM REFUGEES NOW SHELTERING IN CAMBS ALONGSIDE THE TURKISH BORDER WAS AROUND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND THESE ARE
ARE MAINLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND OLD PEOPLE AND THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO WAIT AT THE BORDER BECAUSE THE TURKISH BORDER CROSSING STILL REMAINS CLOSED I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME PEOPLE WHO MADE THEIR WAYS AND WONDERED WHAT MADE THEIR WAY ACROSS THE BORDER AND BEING TREATED IN TURKISH HOSPITALS TODAY TOLD ME ABOUT THE DRASTIC SITUATIONS THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE EVEN SLEEPING IN OUR SOME LUCKY ONES AS THEY PUT IT WE'RE SLEEPING IN TENTS
BUT THE OTHERS WE'RE OUT IN THE COLD OUR SLEEPING UNDER TREES IN THE MUD AND ALL OF THEM TOLD ME THEY JUST WANT TO GO BACK BECAUSE ALL THEIR FAMILIES THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN WERE STILL STAYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOARD AND THEY SAID WE JUST WANT TO GO BACK TAKE OUR FAMILIES AND COME BACK TO SECURITY INTO TURKEY SO HE'D GET IT ON THE TURKEY SYRIA BORDER THANK YOU
IT'S A QUARTER PAST SIX NOW IF YOU'VE BEEN TEMPTED TO CHEER YOURSELF UP AND IT'S COLD AND WET BUT LOOK AT HOLIDAY BROCHURE STARING AT THE SUN AND THE BLUE SKY YOU'RE NOT ALONE BUT THE TRAVEL SUITOR IS STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT AT THE MOMENT AS J. LYMAN WILL TELL US WITH THAT AND ALL THE REST OF BUSINESS YES GOOD MORNING IF THAT'S TRUE TERROR ATTACKS AND PARIS TURKEY TUNISIA EGYPT AND NOW THE ZIGGER VIRUS IN THE CARIBBEAN THEY CAN OR RUIN HOLIDAY PLANS AND SERIOUSLY AFFECT TRAVEL COMPANIES
WE JUST HAD AN UPDATE FROM ONE OF THE BIGGEST TROUBLE FIRMS TO E. WHICH OWNS THOMPSON AND FIRST CHOICE IT SAYS ITS GLOBAL TURNOVER WAS UP FIVE PER CENT IN THE FIRST FINANCIAL QUARTER TO THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION EUROS BUT PRE TAX LOSSES WERE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION EUROS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER WHICH TWO HE SAYS IT'S NORMAL BECAUSE ESTHER PAY FOR ALL THOSE HOTELS IN ADVANCE OF THE SUMMER TO HIS RIVAL'S THOMAS COOK UPDATE US ON THURSDAY SO LET'S HAVE A CHAT ABOUT THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY IN GENERAL WITH MARTIN ALLCOCK FROM TRAVEL TRADE CONSULTANCY GOOD MORNING TO YOU MARTIN
MORNING JOE WHAT DID YOU MAKE THEM THE TWO RESULTS THEY'RE ACTUALLY SURPRISINGLY GOOD I THINK JOE I MEAN THERE'S THE FIRST QUARTER RESULTS WHICH TELL US WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON UP UNTIL THE END OF DECEMBER BUT FOR ME MORE INTERESTINGLY IS THE SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE FIRST MONTH OF OF THIS YEAR JANUARY PARTICULARLY
VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR TRAVEL COMPANIES THESE GUYS CAN EXPECT TO SELL UP TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THEIR ANNUAL HOLIDAYS JUST IN THAT ONE MONTH SIR GETTING OFF TO A GOOD START IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THEM AND SOME PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN NECESSARILY SCARED OFF LOW I SUPPOSE WE NEED TO REMIND PEOPLE OF THAT TRAVEL COMPANIES LIKE TO EAT NO LONGER SELL HOLIDAYS IN TUNISIA AFTER THE TERROR ATTACK IN SEUSS AND THEY'RE NOT TAKING ANY ORDERS FOR SHARM EL SHEIKH EITHER
THAT'S RIGHT SO I WOULDN'T SAY THEY'VE BEEN NECESSARILY SCARED OFF CERTAINLY NOT AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE HASN'T BEEN A BIG CHANGE IN IN BEHAVIOUR SO ONE NUMBER THAT JUMPS OUT HERE IS IS THEIR TURKISH BUSINESSES DOWN FORTY PER CENT NOW TURKEY IS IT IS A BIG MARKET HAS BEEN A BIG MARKET FOR THEM
A LOT OF MODERN HOTEL CAPACITY IN THERE IT'S A IT'S A GOOD QUALITY CHEAP DESTINATION FOR FOUR FOR TEARY AND FOR THOMAS COOK AS WELL ACTUALLY WHAT YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE IS THIS IS THIS RE TRENCH TO SPAIN WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR THESE WHEN YOU SEE THE SORTS OF EVENTS SO BRITISH HOLIDAY MAKERS AND GERMAN POTENTIALLY ARE BUYING IN TRADITIONAL MARKETS BECAUSE OF THAT
TERROR QUESTION THAT'S RIGHT A BIT BIG PUSH BACK TO WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL SAFE DESTINATIONS SPAIN IN THE CANARY ISLANDS IS THE OBVIOUS ONE AND THEN THEY WILL BENEFIT HUGELY FROM THE KIND OF INCIDENTS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND WITH THAT POSE A PROBLEM IF PEOPLE RETRENCHED TO TRADITIONAL MEDITERRANEAN NORTH MEDITERRANEAN MARKETS WOULD THERE BE A CAPACITY SHH I OTHER OF HOTEL BEDS TO DEAL ALL THIS ABOUT WELL I THINK IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A HUGE
PROBLEM I MEAN GOOD FOR THE HOTELIERS IN SPAIN OBVIOUSLY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO COMMAND GOOD GOOD GOOD PRICING THROUGHOUT THE SEASON BUT DON'T FORGET THERE IS OF THE COUNTRIES IN EUROPE GERMANY HAS A A BIG TRADITION OF A SUMMER HOLIDAY IN SPAIN IS A BIG FAVOURITE FOR THEM AS WELL YOU SEE THE NON DIX AGAIN WHO TRADITIONALLY MAYBE HAVE GONE FURTHER AFIELD WILL RETRENCHED SPAIN SO THERE'S LIKELY TO BE A BIG CAPACITY PROBLEM THAT MEANS
WON'T BE CERTAINLY IS AS CHEAP AS WE'VE MAYBE SEEN INDIAN IN YEARS GONE BY SO THAT WILL PUSH THE PRICE OF THE FAMILY HOLIDAY UP I WOULD SAY AND VERY BRIEFLY IT MIGHT AN OIL PRICE HAS GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAS THAT AFFECTED PRICES I DON'T THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT PUSH THROUGH AT THE MOMENT ACTUALLY NO THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THESE GUYS BY THE ROYAL AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE THEY HEDGE TO TO TO COVER THE COST OF ANY FLUCTUATIONS SO A LOT OF THEM WILL HAVE BEEN TIED IN TO MUCH HIGHER OIL PRICES FOR FOR MOST OF LAST YEAR WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE OIL PRICE
THAT THE IMPACT OF THAT COME THROUGH ON THEIR COST BASE BUT BUT INEVITABLY I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING JUMPING OUT OF THE SUPERB MARTIN ALLCOCK THERE FROM TRAVEL TRADE CONSULTANCY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR MARKETS GUESSES PARIS AND FROM FIDELITY WORLDWIDE INVESTMENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU PARIS WHILE A LOT OF RED ON THE BOARD YESTERDAY AND THIS MORNING ESPECIALLY THE BANKING SECTOR
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I THINK THAT WHAT YOU WANT YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE NOW I THINK HIS MANY MARKET PARTICIPANTS STARTING TO LOSE FAITH IN THE CAPACITY OF CENTRAL BANKS TO ACTUALLY DRIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR
FOR MONETARY STIMULUS TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY THAT MANY CENTRAL BANKERS HAVE ADVERTISED THAT THEY SHOWED THAT CHEAP INTEREST RATES AND Q. E. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I THINK THE DIFFICULT INGREDIENT HERE IS IS ALL ABOUT CONFIDENCE YOU KNOW AFTER A POINT IS THERE A QUESTION THAT SHE CONFIDENCE STARTS TO FALL IN THE ECONOMY I THINK THE OTHER
CHALLENGE FOR A LOT OF CENTRAL BANKERS AT THEY FOCUS VERY HEAVILY ON INFLATION AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD WITH SORT OF FALLING ENERGY PRICES AND WIDELY THREAT OF GLACIATION YEAH WHY DID THIS INFLATIONARY TRENDS AND THEREFORE AND WHILST ACTUALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT FALLING ENERGY PRICES AS YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT'S
INCOME POSITIVE TO MANY MANY CUSTOMERS BUT IF YOU ARE IF YOU ARE TARGETING INFLATION OF THE CENTRAL BANK YOU KNOW PERHAPS YOU'RE PERHAPS YOU'RE FACING DOWN THE WRONG ENEMY AND THE BANKS WERE PARTICULARLY HIT YESTERDAY AND SUSPEND BERKELEY SHOW WERE SUSPENDED AT ONE POINT COS THEY WERE DOWN SO MUCH WHY WHY THE BANKS SPECIFICALLY DODGER BANK WAS DONE ONLY TEN PER CENT YESTERDAY I THINK I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IT'S TWO THINGS FIRSTLY THAT THERE A BANK AS A BUSINESS IS A LEVERET ENTITY SO IT HAS A KID
EXPOSURE TO WEATHER THE MACRO ECONOMY I DON'T LIKE ANY ENGLISH THAT BASICALLY MEANS IT'S A LOT OF DEATH THAT'S RIGHT IT HAS A LOT OF DEBT AS PART OF THEIR BUSINESS MODEL NOW THE INVESTMENT BANKS HAVE A DOUBLE EXPOSURE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO EXPOSED TO THE STOCK MARKET AS WELL SO FEARS ABOUT THE MACRO ECONOMY AND FEARS ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET OF THE REASON OF THESE PACKS IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN SO HAVE AND IS IT ALSO A PARIS BECAUSE THEY ARE KIND OF MORE GLOBALLY FOCUSED THEN FOR EXAMPLE A B'S WHICH IS GOING TO SHRINKING TOWARDS MORE U.K. FOCUS BACK THAT'S RIGHT
OH KAY ARE BRIEFLY THERE WAS TALK ABOUT H.S.B.C. STAYING IN LONDON THE FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTING TODAY THAT THEY JUST BE C. HAS KIND OF CHANGED ITS MIND AND THE ENVIRONMENT IS CHANGE WHAT WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
WELL OBVIOUSLY WE HAVEN'T SEEN AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM FROM FROM THE COMPANY BUT I THINK THAT IF WE GO BACK TO LAST YEAR'S BUDGET IS VERY CLEAR THAT THE CHANCELLOR WAS WAS HOPING FOR THIS IS AN OUTCOME AND HENCE THIS PREPARING US TO RE EXAMINE THE BANKING LEVY WERE B. WAS B. C. WAS HARDEST HIT IF THIS DOES TURN OUT TO BE THE CASES WILL BE A POSITIVE FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY SPUR PARIS AND THEY'RE FROM FIDELITY WORLD INVESTMENT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US NOW OLD BILLINGSGATE MARKET IN LONDON IS PLAYING HOST TO A VERY NEW TECHNOLOGY TODAY

THE TIME IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN ACCESS TO ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN ENGLAND IS INADEQUATE WITH SOME PATIENTS HAVING TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO GET ESSENTIAL HELP THAT'S THE FINDING OF A REPORT INTO PSYCHIATRIC CARE PUBLISHED TODAY MICHAEL BUCHANAN A SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE HOW MANY PEOPLE MICHAEL ARE THOUGHT TO BE IN THIS POSITION WHERE THEY'RE HAVING TO TRAVEL A LONG WAY TO GET THE RIGHT MENTAL HEALTH HELP
THIS INDEPENDENT REVIEW MICHELLE SAYS BUT THE ESTIMATE IS THAT FIVE HUNDRED PATIENTS EACH MONTH AFTER THE NOVEL MORE THAN FIFTY MILES AND ORDER TO RECEIVE ESSENTIAL CARE AND KNOW WHAT THE REPORT SAYS THAT BUT IF YOU LIVE IN A RURAL AREA OF PERHAPS YOU NEED TO BE REALLY SPECIALIST CARE THAN THAT MAY BE APPROPRIATE BUT BY AND LARGE IT CONCLUDES THAT FOR MOST OF THESE PEOPLE IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE AT ALL AND WE KNOW THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE WE DID SOME REPORTING LAST YEAR THAT SHOW THAT THE PROBLEM IN ENGLAND HAD INCREASED BY TWENTY THREE PERCENT BETWEEN
THEY'RE BETWEEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE THERE THE THE LEAD IN SOME CASES PEOPLE TO HAVING THE TWO TO KILLING THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY'RE IN CRISIS AND CAN'T GET A BAG THAT HAS LED TO A SORT OF PORT POINTS OUT IT DOES LEAD TO ONE PATIENT BEING ACTUALLY
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO BED AVAILABLE GOING OUT AND STABBING SOMEBODY AND BEING CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER IN THE MAY AND IT ISN'T IT IS LEADING TO PATIENTS FEELING ISOLATED IT HE'S LEAVING TO THEM STAYING IN HOSPITAL A LOT LONGER THAN IT WAS LEADING TO THEM BEING
TAKEN LONGER TO RECOVER AND SALFORD ALL THERE WAS REASONS DISC REVIEW SAY IT SHOULD END WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS BY OCTOBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND IT'S ALSO SUGGESTING THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING QUITE SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF WHAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE SOMETHING AKIN TO THE FOUR HOUR WAITING TIME TARGET AND ANY
INDEED IT'S PART OF THIS THIRD BRANDON ATTEMPT I SHOULD SAY TO TIME GOOD PHYSICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATED IN THE SAME WAY AS YOU SEE IN A. AND E. YOU HAVE AFFORD EITHER TIME TARGET BY WHICH YOU I'VE GOT TO BE SEEN BY A MEDIC AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT MINISTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR ALF AND OFFICIALS AT N.H.S. IN THEM THEY FOCUS INTENTLY ON WHAT THOSE SEE HIS WHITE COUNT YOU DO THE SAME THING FOR FOR MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE BY BRINGING IN A TEST TARGET LIKE THAT YOU WOULD FOCUS ATTENTION ON WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT BY A GEARED BY OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN
A PATIENT IN CRISIS SHOULD EITHER BE ADMITTED WITHIN FOUR HOURS I'D BE GIVEN APPROPRIATE HELP BY CRISIS CARE TEAMS OF COMMUNITY HEALTH TEAMS AT THE SAME TIME WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAVE SAVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS IS THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY ASKED EDDIE CHESS ENGLAND TO STOP THIS PRACTICE OF SENDING PEOPLE LONG DISTANCES TO GET CLEAR AND THEY HAVE SAY THEY'VE LOOKED AT THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS CRUCIALLY AT THIS POINT WE HAVEN'T SAID WHOEVER THEY WILL COMMIT TO THESE TIME LINES OF BEAT THESE DEADLINES
OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALTHOUGH WE HAD EXPECTED A MAJOR GOVERNMENT REPORT ON MENTAL HEALTH AND THE NEXT WEEK OR SO OR SO PERHAPS WE WILL COMMITMENTS TO THESE DEADLINES WILL BECOME MORE APPARENT TO THE COMING DAYS WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS INDEPENDENT REPORT LORD CRISP NIGEL CHRIS AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK
HE'S NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN COULD THE TRIDENT NUCLEAR WEAPONS SYSTEM GO THE WAY OF THE SPIT FAR AT THAT'S WHAT LABOUR M.P.S WERE TOLD LAST NIGHT THEY WERE TOLD BY EMILY THORNBERRY THE SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY AND ON THE MORNING AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE SOME OF THE REVIEWS WERE NOT TOO FLATTERING WHERE THEY NORMANS
IT WAS I THINK A FAIRLY ROBUST MEETING TO PUT IT KINDLY THORNBERRY HAD TO APPEAL TO LABOUR M.P.S TO STOP SHOUTING HAD AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE P. L. P. HAD TO PAUSE PROCEEDINGS JUST TO SETTLE THINGS DOWN AND YES THERE WAS SUPPORT FROM US THORNBERRY BUT AT THE SAME TIME OTHER LABOUR M.P.S TO HER FACE ACCUSED OF LIVING IN LALA LAND AND SO ON AND
YOU KNOW IF EUROPE IS THE GREAT FISSURE IN THE TORY PARTY DEFENCE AND TRIDENT AS BECOMING THE GREAT FISSURE IN THE LABOUR PARTY AND I THINK MY THORNBERRYS DIFFICULTY LAST NIGHT WAS NOT JUST THE CLUMSY ANALOGY WITH SPITFIRE BUT
HER APPEAL TO LABOUR M.P.S TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND ABOUT TRIDENT HER ARGUMENT BEING THAT IT MAY BE OUT OF DATE IN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS' TIME BECAUSE IT'LL BE VULNERABLE TO UNDERWATER DRONES AND CYBER WARFARE BUT MANY LABOUR M.P.S TAKE THE VIEW THAT SHE AND CERTAINLY JEREMY CORBIN DO NOT HAVE AN OPEN MIND ON THE FUTURE OF TRIDENT AND A COMMITTED NOT TO RENEWING IT
AND FOR THEM I THINK IT'S NOT JUST AN ISSUE OF DEFENCE CAPABILITY MANY OF THEM VIEW IT AS AN ISSUE OF POLITICAL CREDIBILITY AND THEIR FEAR I THINK IS THAT JUST AS THEY BELIEVE THE PARTY WAS NOT VIEWED AS ECONOMICALLY CREDIBLE AT THE LAST ELECTION HE NOW RISKS COMPOUNDING THAT BY NOT BEING STRATEGICALLY CREDIBLE AND WE ARE HEARING SOME LABOUR M.P.S SUGGESTING THEY MADE PUT FORWARD THEIR OWN MANIFESTOS AT THE NEXT ELECTION
COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO TRY AND WHATEVER THEIR PARTY NATIONALLY MIGHT DECIDE THAT'S AND THEY HAVE GOT DON'T MIND EITHER THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT TRIED MUST BE RENEWED AND I SUPPOSE IF YOU'RE A SUPPORTER OF MISS THORNBERRY OR AN JEREMY CORBIN YOU COULD SAY WERE NO WONDER THEY BRIEF THE MEDIA AFTERWARDS THAT SHE WAS LIVING IN A LOT OF THEM THEY WOULD WOULDN'T THEY YEAH AND I MEAN THAT IS THE CENTRAL DIFFICULTY HERE MUST ALWAYS GOING TO COME UP WITH THE REVIEW IN JUNE IN THEN THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND HAVE SOME AGREE PARTY POSITION SEPTEMBER BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE HOW YOU BRIDGE THE DIVIDE BEYOND
COMING UP WITH THE FUDGE WHICH IS WHAT I SUSPECT IN THE END THEY WILL HAVE TO DO BECAUSE THE BULK OF THE SHADOW CABINET TO DO THE MAJORITY OF THE PEEL P. ARE WEDDED TO KEEPING TRIDENT I SUSPECT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONSTITUENCY PARTIES WANT TO GET RID OF IT CRITICAL IT'S GOING TO BE THE ROLE OF THE UNIONS THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN PROTECTING JOBS WHICH IS WHY JEREMY CORBIN CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF SUBS WITHOUT NUKES BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SETTLE ON SOME SORT OF FUDGE
BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE HOW THEY BRIDGE THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE TWO SITES AND ME MOTHER RESIST ANOTHER STORY WHICH LABOUR WANTS US TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT OF COURSE IS THIS LETTER THAT'S COME IN FROM THEIR HOME SHADOW HOME SECRETARY TO THE HOME SECRETARY ABOUT THE LIVE US INQUIRY THAT PHIL'S LIKE ANCIENT HISTORY WHAT DO YOU SAY NORM ANDY BURNHAM IS CONVENING A CONFERENCE AT WESTMINSTER DAY OF VARIOUS CAMPAIGN GROUPS WHO ARE PRESSING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO COMMIT TO HOLDING THE SECOND STAGE OF THEIR LEVERSON ENQUIRY WHICH LOOKS INTO RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE POLICE AND THE PRESS INTO PHONE HACKING INTO POLICE CORRUPTION AMID SIGNS SHALL WE SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS BECOMING SOMEWHAT LUKEWARM ABOUT IT IN PART ONE SUSPECTS BECAUSE LEVISON ONE DESPITE TWO YEARS AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF WITNESSES AT THE END OF THE DAY DID NOT RESULT IN MUCH BEYOND THE CENTRAL PROPOSAL TO SET UP AN INDEPENDENT REGULATOR WHICH MOST OF THE NEWSPAPERS IGNORED IN PART TWO I SUSPECT BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY AWARENESS ABOUT
UNSETTLING THE PRESS IN THE RUN UP TO A VERY DIFFICULT EURO REFERENDUM AND IMPART TO BECAUSE OF WHAT I WOULD TERM AN INQUIRY ITIS A SENSE OF THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF INQUIRIES SOME GOING ON AND ON AND ON YOU THINK OF CHILL CAN'T YOU THINK OF
THE PLANNED INQUIRE INTO CHILD ABUSE AND THERE MAY JUST BE A RESERVATION ABOUT HAVING YET ANOTHER INQUIRY INTO THE PRESS ALL THAT MINISTERS ARE SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL ALL THE COURT CASE IS CURRENTLY GOING ON THERE CONCLUDED BEFORE REACHING THE FINAL DECISION ON IF THEY WERE HOPING FOR A BETTER AND EASIER HEARING IN THE IN THE WHAT WE USED TO GO TORY PRESS THEY'RE NOT GETTING ON AT THE MOMENT ON EUROPE NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US

THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN ON MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION CHAIRED BY A FORMER N.H.S. CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAYS THE HEALTH SERVICE IN ENGLAND SHOULD STOP SENDING MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS HUNDREDS OF MILES FOR
JUNIOR DOCTORS WILL BE ON STRIKE AGAIN TOMORROW AS A RESULT THOUSANDS OF HOSPITAL OPERATIONS WILL BE CANCELLED THAT SAY HEALTH MINISTERS IS BECAUSE THE DOCTORS' UNION THE B.M.A. SIMPLY WON'T NEGOTIATE YESTERDAY IN THE COMMONS LABOUR ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF MISHANDLING THIS DISPUTE HE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN
THE CASUAL OBSERVER COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING THAT THE HEALTH MINISTER BEN GUMMER HAS ACQUIRED A NEW AND RATHER UNUSUAL NICKNAME FOR THE SECOND MONDAY IN A RAY HIS APPEARANCE IN THE COMMONS WAS MARKED BY SHOUTS OF WHERE IS HE
LABOUR HAD ASKED THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT AN URGENT QUESTION BUT MISTER GUMMER WAS AT THE DESPATCH BOX TO TALK ABOUT TOMORROW'S PLANNED STRIKE ROBUST CONTINGENCY PLANNING HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE TO TRY TO MINIMISE RISK OF HARM TO THE PUBLIC
I REGRET TO INFORM THE HOUSE BUT LATEST ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED THE ROW IS OVER WORKING HOURS AND PAY FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND THE SHADOW HEALTH SECRETARY HEIDI ALEXANDER ACCUSE JEREMY HUNT OF INSULTING THE INTELLIGENCE OF DOCTORS BY TELLING THEM THEY'D BEEN MISLED BY THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
IF HE WAS HERE MISTER SPEAKER I ASK HIM IF HE REGRETS THE WAY HE'S HANDLED THIS DISPUTE HE HASN'T EVEN GOT THE NERVE TO TURN UP
MISTER SPEAKER NO ONE IS SAYING THE EXISTING JUNIOR DOCTOR CONTRACT IS PERFECT BUT SPEAK TO ANYONE IN THE AIR
I'LL TELL YOU THAT THIS WHOLE EPISODE HAS BEEN AN EXERCISE IN USING A SLEDGEHAMMER TO CRACK A NUT
SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THERE WASN'T A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION SHE ASKED MY GUMMER TO RULE OUT IMPOSING A NEW CONTRACT ON THE JUNIOR DOCTORS HE SAID THE DOOR WAS STILL OPEN FOR THE B.M.A. TO RETURN TO TALKS BUT AT SOME POINT WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE CHANGES WHICH ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET THAT CONSISTENCY OF SERVICE
OVER THE WEEKENDS WE CANNOT DELAY THIS ANY LONGER AND BEN GUMMER SAID MINISTERS DID HAVE REGRETS ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED WE HAVE REGRETS THAT THE BEER MAY WILFULLY MISLED ITS MEMBERS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS
MAKING THEM BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A CUT TO PAY INCREASE AND OURS ARE NEITHER OF WHICH WAS TRUE THE S. M. PEAS DOCTOR PHILIPPA WHITFORD SAID IT COULDN'T ALL BE PUT ON THE B.M.A. AND SHE POINTED OUT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS AND SCOTLAND WEREN'T ON STRIKE
JUNIOR DOCTORS ALREADY WORK SEVEN DAYS AND SEVEN NIGHTS A WEEK SO I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW THE JUNIOR DOCTORS CAN ACTUALLY BE A BARRIER
IN THIS CASE TO THE SAFETY OF PATIENTS I DO THINK
BUT LOOKING BACK THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND INDEED THE MINISTER MAY REGRET HOW THIS WAS HANDLED RIGHT FROM LAST SUMMER IT HAS BEEN SO COMBATIVE
A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT FORMER HEALTH MINISTER NORMAN LAMB SUGGESTED THE GOVERNMENT HAD CHOSEN THE WRONG TARGET CHAIRS OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF HOSPITALS CONSTANTLY TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE NO DIFFICULTY STAFFIE THERE HOSPITALS OVER WEEKENDS HIS JUNIOR DOCTORS AND YET AT THE SAME TIME
A G.P. OUT OF HOURS SERVICES ARE UNDER INCREDIBLE STRAIN IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY COVER IS THREADBARE THAT SURELY IS WHERE THE REAL SAFETY CONCERNS
MISTER GUMMER SAID THE GOVERNMENT WAS LOOKING AT THE CONTRACTS FOR G.P.S AND CONSULTANTS AS WELL AS THOSE FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE CONSERVATIVE CRISPIN BLUNT WONDERED IF THE MINISTER COULD HELP HIM THE MESSAGING I'VE HEARD FROM THE B.M.A. IS THAT THIS DISPUTE IS NOTHING TO DO WITH
WE'VE HEARD THE ISSUES DESCRIBED AS A NOT BY THE SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE YET IT IS ALLEGED TO A NATIONAL STRIKE THE FIRST TIME IN FOR FOR FORTY YEARS I WAS THE SECOND STRIKE A ROVING FACE THE DUST WILL ACTUALLY GAIN WHAT IS GOING ON
BEN SAID THAT WAS HIS QUESTION FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE B.M.A. LABOUR FORMER MINISTER BEN BRADSHAW WASN'T IMPRESSED BY JEREMY HUNT NON APPEARANCE IS IT NOT AT THE VERY LEAST OUGHT MISTER SPEAKER THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE YET AGAIN CHOOSES TO STAY AWAY AND NOT COME HIMSELF
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT BEFORE THEIR HOUSE I KNOW THE A FORMER HEALTH MINISTER HOW DIFFICULT THE B.M.A. CAN BE BUT THIS WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE TO ME THAT IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS BECOME THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO A SENSIBLE SOLUTION TO THIS
BEN GUMMER HAD BEEN KEEPING SCHOOL THE PREVIOUS LABOUR GOVERNMENT NUMERICALLY HAD FAR MORE SCRAPS OF THE BEER MADE IN THIS PREVIOUS COALITION AND THIS GOVERNMENT HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR
YOU HE WILL KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A MARK OF ALL HEALTH SECRETARIES TO HAVE DISPUTES OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER WITH THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND HE SAID JEREMY HUNT WOULD BE IN THE COMMONS TODAY FOR HIS REGULAR QUESTION TIME
THAT WAS SEAN CURRAN REPORTING CAN HEAR MORE OF COURSE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT OVER ON ONE NINETY EIGHT LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO SHALL WE HAVE TOP STATE AND IN POLITICS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC VOTING'S BEGUN IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THREE SMALL COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE BEGIN VOTING AT MIDNIGHT AND THE RESULTS FROM DICK'S PHIL NOTCH WHICH HAS JUST NINE VOTERS CAME IN IN THE LAST HOUR
THE RESULTS I'LL BE PUB HAD BEEN SO WE HAVE FOUR DON'T TAKE UP TOO
I'M O.K. SICK WE HAVE THREE
THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE BUT WE BOTH HAVE BEEN WRONG BUT I WERE DEMOCRATIC SIDE WE HAVE FOUR BALD VERY SALINGER
SORRY SO THE FIRST TWO VOTES FOR DONALD TRUMP WHO'S BEEN LEADING THE OPINION POLLS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE JIM NOT HE'S THERE TO WATCH IT ALL FOR US AND I ASKED HIM FIRST ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN I HAD THREE OR FOUR HOURS AGO MICHELLE AND SOUNDING AS HE ALWAYS
MISTER ANGRY VENTING THE ANGER OF THE PEOPLE WHOSE FRUSTRATION HE SAYS THAT HE REPRESENTS NOW HE'S NOT JUST ANGRY HE'S ALSO QUITE
FUNNY AND HE TAKES HIS AUDIENCE ALONG WITH THEM HE IS IN A STATE OF EUPHORIA HE THINKS HE WILL WIN
THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY ALL THE OTHER CAMPAIGNS THINK HE WILL WIN AS WELL AND HE WILL HEAD OFF TO
SOUTH CAROLINA IN TEN DAYS' TIME AS SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES HE CAN WIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION NOW THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF ANGST IN REPUBLICAN RANKS ABOUT A TRUMP NOMINATION THEY WORRY ABOUT AND THEY WORRY ABOUT HIS
HIS POLICY HIS STYLE ALL THE REST OF IT BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT AND THE REAL STORY HERE TOMORROW NIGHT ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE AGENDAS GOING TO BE WHOSE SECOND IS IT MARK OR RUBY OR WHO WAS COMING UP AND HAD A DISASTROUS DEBATE
IN THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND HE'S BASED HAVE SLIPPED BACK A WEE BIT JEB BUSH JOHN CASEY
UNKNOWN IN EUROPEAN TERMS UNKNOWN OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST PRETTY WELL UNKNOWN OUTSIDE OHIO THREE TEN ELECTED GOVERNOR OF WHAT I WAS DOING RATHER WELL HERE SO BASIC BUT
TED CREWS WHO WON THE IOWA CAUCUSES AND RUBY OR ARE ALL STRUGGLING AWAY THERE FOR THAT SECOND PLACE AND THAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE
REALLY HOW THE RACE PLAYS OUT FROM HERE ON IN AND MAKE NO MISTAKE COME IN THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THIS IS HUGELY IMPORTANT
THE PROSPECT OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO START TAKING VERY SERIOUSLY AND SIMPLE AS THAT AND ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE HILLARY CLINTON HASN'T LOOKED AS IF SHE HAS MUCH HOPE OF WINNING THIS PARTICULAR STATE IT DOES SHE SOUND AS IF SHE'S RESIGNED TO THAT YES BERNIE SANDERS
THE INDEPENDENT TERRITORIES CAUCUS WITH THE DEMOCRATS OF COURSE BUT IT WOULD BE TYPICALLY INDEPENDENT SENATOR FROM VERMONT NEXT DOOR WILL EVERYBODY ACCEPTS WIN
IT'S ALSO BELIEVED BY PRETTY WELL EVERYBODY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE AGENDA THAT SOONER OR LATER HILLARY CLINTON WILL BECOME THE NOMINEE BUT YOU KNOW THAT ARE BIG QUESTIONS FOR HER TO ANSWER HERE I SPENT A BIT OF TIME WITH HER OR WATCHING HER OVER THE WEEKEND
AND IT'S FORCEFUL IT'S OF COURSE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT IT
IT'S ABSOLUTELY FULL OF EXPERIENCE AND SO ON BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT GUTSY EXCITEMENT GOING TO A BERNIE SANDERS RALLY YESTERDAY FULL OF KIDS STUDENTS
THEY WERE ECSTATIC ABOUT THIS MAN WHO COULD SOMEHOW ENCAPSULATE A SENSE OF EXCITEMENT VERY LIKE THE SENSE OF EXCITEMENT THE DONALD TRUMP ON THE OTHER SIDE EXCITES IN TROOPS WHO ARE FLOCKING TO AND WERE NOT
REGULAR VOTERS NOT REGISTERED REPUBLICANS ARE REGISTERED DEMOCRAT BUT THEY WANT TO SAY
WE LIKE THIS GUY AND WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH TIM KNOTTY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THANK YOU

EMILY THORNBERRY DEFENCE REVIEW HAS HAD EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK OF UNITING UNILATERAL DISARMER HAS SUCH AS A LEADER JEREMY CORBIN AND THE MAJORITY OF LABOUR M.P.S WHO SUPPORTS THE RETENTION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS SO IT WAS PERHAPS HARDLY SURPRISING THAT SOME M.P.S TAUGHT HER SHE WAS LIVING IN LA LA LAND AND LATER DESCRIBED TO PERFORMANCE AS WAFFLY
THE SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY HAS PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED HER OWN OPPOSITION TO RENEWING BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM BUT INSISTED TO REVIEW WOULD BE WIDE RANGING EXAMINING THE THREATS FROM TERRORISM AS MUCH AS A FUTURE OF TRIDENT
RAISED QUESTIONS OF A WEATHER TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES COULD A NEW NUCLEAR SUBMARINES OBSOLETE BUT EMPHASISED AT ALL MY LABOURS ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN SEPTEMBER COULD CHANGE THE PARTY'S POSITION THAT'S LIKELY TO BE AFTER THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS AN INITIAL VAULT AND TRIDENT ALONE LABOUR M.P.S WHO BACKED RENEWAL TO INSIST THEY'RE FOLLOWING EXISTING PARTY POLICY
POLICE IN HONG KONG USED ABOUT ONS AND PEPPER SPRAY IN CLASHES WITH PROTESTERS FOLLOWING AN OPERATION TO CLEAR ILLEGAL STREET VENDORS FORTY EIGHT POLICE OFFICERS WERE INJURED AND TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE ARRESTED IT WAS THE WORST UNREST IN THE TERRITORY SINCE PRO DEMOCRACY POACH PROTESTS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

A B. B. C. SURVEY SUGGESTS MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF CHILDREN AGED BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS DESPITE MOST WEBSITES AND ABS HAVING A MINIMUM AGE LIMIT OF THIRTEEN NEWSROUND SPOKE TO A THOUSAND TEN TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS ACROSS THE U.K. HE'S MARC ASHDOWN
FACEBOOK IS THE MOST POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA SITE AMONG THE CHILDREN SURVEYED WITH HALF OF THEM SIGNED UP INSTAGRAM WHAT'S UP AND SNAP CHATS ARE ALSO WIDELY USED BUT THESE SITES ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A MINIMUM AGE LIMIT OF THIRTEEN
A QUARTER OF THE TEN TO TWELVE YEAR OLD SURVEYED SAID THEY'D BEEN BULLIED OR TROLLED ONLINE AND MORE THAN A THIRD ADMITTED THEY'D MADE FRIENDS IN CYBERSPACE WITH SOMEONE THEY'D NEVER MET IN PERSON
EVEN SO THE MAJORITY SAID THEY FELT HAPPY USING SOCIAL MEDIA OF THE MAJOR SIGHTS ONLY INSTAGRAM RESPONDED SAYING USES ARE REQUIRED TO BE OVER THIRTEEN THEY SAY THEY CONSTANTLY WORKING TO CREATE A SAFE OPEN AND FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL THEIR USES MARC ASHDOWN REPORTING IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE I.R.A. OR GORM AND THEIR WEAPONS ARE GONE SO SAID SINN FEIN TO GERRY ADAMS IN RESPONSE TO THIS
THAT THE SOUND OF THE MAYHEM WHICH FOLLOWED FOUR GUNMEN OPENING FIRE IN THE REGENCY HOTEL IN DUBLIN ON FRIDAY NIGHT WEAR A BOXING MATCH WAS BEING STAGED THE GOVERNMENT HAD MARCHED IN WEARING PARAMILITARY UNIFORMS AND NEED KAREN CARROT KALASHNIKOVS THE GROUP WHICH CALLS ITSELF CONTINUITY I.R.A. FIRST CLAIMED AND THEN PUZZLINGLY LATER DENIED RESPONSIBILITY THE MAN TARGETED WAS SAID TO BE A MEMBER OF THE RIVAL REEL I R. A.
THEN LAST NIGHT FOUR DAYS LATER ANOTHER MAN WAS SHOT DEAD IN DUBLIN THE POLICE FEAR IT MAY HAVE BEEN A REPRISAL FOR THAT HOTEL ATTACK WITH A GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN UNDERWAY AND IRELAND SINN FEIN WHICH HOPES TO GET AS MANY AS ONE IN SIX VOTES IT INSISTED THAT IT WAS SIMPLY A BATTLE BETWEEN THOSE JERRY ADAM
GERRY ADAMS DUBBED CRIMINAL THUGS WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON LET'S JOIN JOHN MOONEY THE ISLAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FOR THE SUNDAY TIMES MORNING TO YOU JOHN GOOD MORNING CRIMINAL THUGS PARAMILITARIES OR FRANKLIN'S THERE NO DISTINCTION
SIGNIFICANT PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS SO BRAZEN
AND WHAT ARE WE MEANT TO MAKE OF THE BIZARRE SITUATION IN WHICH CONTINUITY I.R.A. ONE MINUTE CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN THE NEXT DENY IT
THERE'S LONG BEEN KNOWN OF COURSE THAT EVEN AFTER THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT EVEN AFTER AS GERRY ADAMS CLAIMS THE I.R.A. WAS DISBANDED THERE WERE STILL PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO REGARDED THEMSELVES AS PARAMILITARIES PREPARED TO USE VIOLENCE IS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT ANY SORT OF SCALE ON THE NUMBERS INVOLVED
JOHN MOONEY THIS IS A MATTER OF COURSE JOHN MANY THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WELL THE SECOND PART OF THE LEVERSON INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRESS AND THE POLICE EVER TAKE PLACE WHEN THE INQUIRY WAS ANNOUNCED THIS STAGE WAS PUT ON HOLD BECAUSE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE WAKE OF THE PHONE HACKING SCANDAL AND POTENTIALLY CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS NEEDED TO BE COMPLETED
NOW THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM HAS WRITTEN TO CABINET MINISTERS DEMANDING THAT PART TWO OF LEVERSON GOES AHEAD HE'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SIR WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU THINK IT WON'T GO AHEAD WITH THE REPORT'S LATE LAST YEAR THAT SUGGESTED THAT I WOULD WANT TO PRAISE TO HIS NAME THE GOVERNMENT FOR BEING PREPARED TO SHINE A LIGHT ON SOME OF THE DARKER MOMENTS IN OUR COUNTRY'S PAST
BUT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE STILL FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE FROM THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE SEVENTIES EIGHTIES AND NINETIES I'M INVITING SOME OF THEM TO PARLIAMENT TODAY AND THE COMMON THREAD BETWEEN THEM IS AN UNHEALTHY CLOSENESS BETWEEN GOVERNMENT POLICE AND PRESS THAT'S THE COMMON THREAD BETWEEN ALL OF THESE CAMPAIGNS
AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THE SECOND STAGE LEVELS AN AND IS CRUCIAL IT NEEDS TO SET OUT A MUCH BETTER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE PRESS BETTER TO PROTECT VICTIMS GOING FORWARD AND GIVE THEM THE JUSTICE THAT THEY DESERVE
THE WHAT THE HOME OFFICE HAS SAID TO US IS THAT NO DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN AND THAT ALL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND TRIALS RELATED TO POLE ONE OF LEATHER SIR NEED TO BE CONCLUDED FIRST NOW IF IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THEY'VE BEEN HARDLY ANY CONVICTIONS POSTAL LEVERSON IN TERMS OF OF ANY PAYMENTS TO PUBLIC OFFICIALS EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HISTORIC CASES OF PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE IT DOES RATHER SUGGEST THAT IN TERMS OF THE PRESS HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POLICE THERE ISN'T REALLY A SMOKING GUN
I DON'T ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE SAW SOME OF THE REVELATIONS THAT THEY WERE ABOUT HACKING YES YOU'RE RIGHT ONLY LEAD TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CONVICTION BUT THERE WERE CONVICTIONS BUT I THINK THERE WAS ANY DOUBT THAT THERE WERE WIDESPREAD
PRACTICES THAT WERE AGAINST THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND ALONGSIDE THAT THERE ARE OTHER CASES THAT INVOLVE POLICE AND PRESS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PHONE HACKING SCANDAL OR WILL KNOW BUT THEY'RE CONNECTED AREN'T THEY IN TERMS OF A LACK OF OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FOR INSTANCE IS THAT THE DANIEL MORGAN CASE AND HIS BROTHER DONE BROTHER ALISTAIR HE'S COMING TO PARLIAMENT TODAY
OF COURSE THE CASE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE HILLSBOROUGH SITUATION OBVIOUSLY WE'RE STILL AWAITING THE VERDICT OF THE INQUEST SO THERE'S A LIMIT TO WHAT CAN BE SAID ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IN OUR COUNTRY'S PAST WERE A AN UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICE AND PRESS HAS LED TO A FEELING THAT JUSTICE HAS BEEN DENIED
AND I BELIEVE THE SECOND STAGE OF THE LEVELLERS INQUIRY IS CRUCIAL TO TO DRAW TOGETHER ALL OF THOSE THREADS TO LEARN FROM THEM AND THEN SET OUT A BETTER BASIS FOR A RELATIONSHIP IN THE POLICE IMPRESSED GOING FOR WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE
CONDUCT FOR POLICE OFFICERS WHEN WHEN DEALING WITH THE PRESS AND I THINK THAT DOES NEED TO BE SET UP THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HOPE LEVERSON TWO WOULD DO BUT WE DO OFTEN A LOT OF SLABS AND WE HAVE LOTS OF ENQUIRIES WE OFTEN ORDERED AND IF YOU LOOK AT LEVERSON ALONE COST OF SOMETHING LIKE FIVE MILLION DO YOU REALLY FEEL THAT PART TWO IS GOING TO ACHIEVE
SOMETHING THAT THAT IS WORTH IT YES I DO BECAUSE I THINK WE'LL ONLY GET THE FULL VALUE OF THAT MONEY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SPENT ON THIS IF WE SEE THE JOB THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT'S ONLY DONE HALF THE JOB AT THE MOMENT I TAKE THE POINT ENTIRELY THAT THERE ARE
INVESTIGATIONS THAT NEED TO CONCLUDE BEFORE WE PROCEED BUT I'M CALLING TODAY FOR FOR A COMMITMENT THAT WILL HAPPEN THE PRIME MINISTER PROMISED THERE WOULD BE A SECOND STAGE INQUIRY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND HE WAS RIGHT TO SUGGEST THAT I BELIEVE THIS IS PART OF POLICE REFORM AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE NEED TO BE SURE GOING FORWARD THAT VICTIMS OF INJUSTICE CANNOT BE TREATED IN THIS WAY AGAIN WHEN HER VERSION OF EVENTS IS PERPETRATED THROUGH THE PRESS SOMETIMES
THAT SETS BACK THEIR CAMPAIGN TO GET TO THE TRUTH O.K. HOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL FIGHTING FOR THE TRUTH ALL THESE YEARS ON ON ANOTHER SUBJECT THERE'S A MEETING OF THE SHADOW CABINET LATER TODAY ON THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT YOU WERE AT THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY LAST NIGHT MEETING WHAT WHAT DID YOU THINK OF WHAT EMILY THORNBERRY SAID ABOUT
TRIDENT POTENTIALLY GOING AWAY THE SPITFIRE I WAS AT THE PARLIAMENT TREVOR PARTY AND IT CONFIRMED SOMETHING THAT MANY OF US HAVE LONG SUSPECTED THAT THE DEBATES ABOUT TRIDENT IN THE LABOUR PARTY'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT REMIT WELL I KNOW THAT FROM THE LEADERSHIP OF STINGS AND I SET UP MY POSITION VERY CLEARLY THEN MULTILATERAL EST NOT SO UNA NATURALIST AND I WOULD VOTE FOR THE RENEWAL OF TRIDENT I BELIEVE THE WORLD IS
IS VERY UNCERTAIN AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN TAKE A STEP ON OUR OWN INTO THE UNKNOWN RIGHT NOW SO I'VE SET UP MY POSITION WE ALWAYS KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT DEBATE FOR THE PARTY THERE ARE TWO POSITIONS HERE THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONCILE AND THE PARTY'S GOT TO FIND SOME WAY OF ACCOMMODATING THOSE POSITIONS AND MOVE FORWARD AND NOT LET THIS ISSUE TAKE OVER EVERYTHING HOW COULD IT
RECONCILE THOSE THOSE TWO POSITION I SAID I THINK IT IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ISN'T IT THERE'S SOME HYBRID OPTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE FOUND THAT THEY THEY JUST DON'T WORK SO
THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN IN THE PARTY ABOUT HOW CAN YOU REALISTICALLY TRY AND FIND A HALFWAY HOUSE OR MOST PEOPLE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT YOU CAN'T AND THEREFORE IF THERE ARE TWO POSITIONS THAT ARE DEEPLY HELD ON BOTH SIDES BUT WHO CAN'T EASILY BE RECONCILED THE PARTING IS TO FIND SOME WAY OF ACCOMMODATING THAT'S ALLOWING PEOPLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND ACTUALLY MOVE ON TO OTHER ISSUES AND HOLD THE GOVERNMENT TO ACCOUNT ON ON MANY OTHER ISSUES WHERE IT WHERE IT'S FAILING PEOPLE
ANDY BURNHAM THANK YOU THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING TO THE SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY EMILY THORNBERRY AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN JOE'S HERE WITH A BUSINESS NEEDS JEFF YEAH I JUST A BRIEF NOTE ON THE MARKETS ARE BECAUSE AS WE DISCUSSED ABOUT AN HOUR AGO THE MARKETS IN ASIA OR DOWN MARKEDLY THOSE THAT WERE OPEN MANY OF THEM WERE CLOSE FOR THE CHINESE NEW YEAR THE MICHAELMAS DOWN FIVE POINT THREE FIVE PER CENT WITH BANKS DOWN AROUND TEN PER CENT ALSO DOWN IN AUSTRALIA ALSO DOWN IN INDONESIA
THIS FOLLOWS FROM A EUROPEAN MARKET SELL OFF OF AROUND THREE PERCENT YESTERDAY BASICALLY TRADER SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN A VIEW THAT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CENTRAL BANKS CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE GROWTH OR EVEN PREVENT A GLOBAL RECESSION SO LET'S SEE BUT MARKETS DO WHEN THEY OPEN AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING HERE IN EUROPE BEFORE THAT THAT'S TRYING TO HOUSE BUILDING AND ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST HOUSE BUILDERS READ ROW HAS JUST SAID THAT IT'S PRE TAX PROFIT
WHA'S UP FOURTEEN PERCENT FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THEIR FINANCIAL YEAR TO ONE HUNDRED FOUR MILLION THE NUMBER OF NEW PROPERTIES COMPLETED BY RED ROLE WAS UP EIGHTEEN PERCENT TO TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S HELP TO BUY SCHEME HELPING DEMAND A LOSS AND LET'S TALK TO STEVE MORGAN THE CHAIRMAN AND FOUNDER OF RED ROAD MORNING STEVE GOOD MORNING JO RECORD NUMBERS FOR YOU GUYS HELP TO BUY HELPED A LOT
HELP TO BUY A CERTAINLY HELPED THE MARKET DEAD QUITE DEFINITELY BUT IT'S NOT JUST HELP TO BUY THIS BUT THE MARKET IS STRONG DEMAND IS STRONG AND HAS BEEN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WE THINK IT'S SET TO CONTINUE AND IF THE HELP TO BUY SCHEME WERE TO END WITH I HAVE A PRETTY DRAMATIC IMPACT ON YOU
WELL QUITE HELPFULLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN HER TIME TIME LINE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE AROUND AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND SO THAT THAT THAT IS VERY HELPFUL FOR US TO INVEST BECAUSE KNOWING THAT THAT IS THEIR GIVES US CONFIDENCE THEN TO GO UP BY A LOT MORE LAND WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DOING BEEN INVESTING VERY STRONGLY IN LAND AND GET GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS WITHOUT THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROBABLY GET THE SAME
HAVE THE SAME CONFIDENCE TO INVEST AND THERE'S A REPORT OUT TODAY FROM THE LIB DEM SUGGESTING THAT THE AVERAGE PROPERTY IN THE U.K. WILL BE OVER A MILLION POUNDS BY TWENTY THIRTY TWO BUT AFFORDABILITY ISSUE'S GOING TO BE A SERIOUS PLAYER ISN'T IT
WELL I DON'T RECOGNISE THOSE FIGURES AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THESE THINGS COME FROM BUT AFFORDABILITY IS AN ISSUE PARTICULARLY AROUND LONDON IT'S NOT SO MUCH AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT AGAIN THE THE NEW FORTY PER CENT HELP TO BUY WE'LL WE'LL HOPEFULLY GET PEOPLE FIRST TIME BUYERS ONTO THE LADDER AND SKILLS SHORTAGES THAT'S ANOTHER THING I PRESUME YOU LIKE SO MANY OTHER SECOND WORRY ABOUT
SKILL SHORTAGE IT IS AN ISSUE FOR THE INDUSTRY IT IT'D PROBABLY LESS OF AN ISSUE THAN IT WAS SIX TWELVE MONTHS AGO WE ARE RED ROE IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF TRAINING WE HAVE MORE APPRENTICES TRAINEES RELATIVE TO OUR SIZE AND ANY OTHER ANY OTHER BUSINESS SO WE RECOGNISE THAT AS A PROBLEM AND IT'S SOMETHING ARE VERY DEEPLY TRYING TO DOUBT DO SOMETHING ABOUT STEAM MORGAN THE CHAIRMAN AND FOUNDER OF RED ROPE
TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN WOULD YOU OR HAVE YOU ALLOWED A TWELVE YEAR OLD TO USE INSTAGRAM SNAPPED AT FACEBOOK OR ANY OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA YOU SHOULDN'T BECAUSE THE MINIMUM AGE IS THIRTEEN AND YET A SURVEY HAS FOUND THAT NEARLY EIGHTY PER CENT OF TEN TO TWELVE YEAR OLDS HAVE A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT IT WAS COMMISSIONED BY B.B.C. NEWSROUND WHICH HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO YEAR SEVEN CHILDREN AND SUNDERLAND ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA
INSTAGRAM AND UP POST PICTURES
FOR MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAT FOLLOWERS I HAVE INSTAGRAM MASSAGER SAY USE THAT TO CHEF AUTOS AND I HAVE YOUTUBE BITTER JUST SAY
RESEARCH VIDEOS AND WATCH VIDEOS AND STUFF NEVER REALLY SEEN ANY BULLYING GOING ON AND I'VE NEVER BEEN VALETED AYE AH'VE X.P. BUT H.P. PRIVATE MESSAGES BELIQUE ASHURA JED I'M JUST LEAVING IT I WORRY FRIENDS RUSH HOUR YOU TRUE ACCOUNT AS WELL ELVES LOOK DOWN THE COMMENT ON ONE AND I SWEAR I HAVE YEARS OF LANGUAGE
ANY COMMENTS LIKE THAT AND ALSO VERY FEW GOOD ONES
WOULD THE POWER LINES WILL PLEASE HORRIBLE WANT ONE OF MY FRIENDS HAS BEEN QUITE BADLY BULLIED ON THE SOCIAL NETWORK AND TAKE ME DID IT AFFECT HER QUITE BAD BECAUSE SHE'S NEVER BEEN AND LOOKED IN
SOME SEVEN CHILDREN WHO WAS SPEAKING TO B. B. C. NEWSROUND WILL CAROLINE HAS DOES EDUCATION MANAGER CHILD INTERNATIONAL A CHARITY WHICH WORKS WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ON INTERNET SAFETY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING IT IS A VERY STRIKING FOR SCENTED AT THE EIGHTY PER CENT OF TEN TO TWELVE YEAR OLDS USING SOCIAL MEDIA ABSOLUTELY IT IS A STRIKING PERCENTAGE BUT TODAY'S SAFER INTERNET DAY AND TODAY THE SCENE FOR SAFER INTERNET DAY PLAY YOUR PART FOR A BET INTERNET
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INTERNET IS A SAFE AND POSITIVE PLACE FOR THEM TO BE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT THEIR PARENTS ISN'T IT IF YOU'RE I MEAN DO YOU THINK THAT THAT THE PARENTS OF THESE TEN TO TWELVE YEAR OLDS WERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA DON'T MIND THEM BEING ON IT OR JUST AREN'T AWARE THAT THESE SITES GENERALLY HAVE A HAVE A MINIMUM AGE OF THIRTEEN WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THE MOST PARENTS ARE UNAWARE OF THE THIRTEEN AGE RESTRICTION IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE EDUCATING PARENTS AND CARERS ABOUT HOW TO KEEP THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN SAFE ONLINE
AND SAY FOR INTERNET DAY IS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WE'RE COLLABORATING WITH DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE LOTS OF RESOURCES ON OUR SITE SAFE INTERNET DOT ORG DOT U.K. WHICH WILL SHOW PARENTS EXACTLY HOW TO PUT IN PRIVACY SETTINGS IF THEIR CHILDREN ARE UNDERAGE AND IF THEY ARE USING IT AND ALSO WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT GUIDELINES AS TO WHAT A CHILD NEEDS TO BE TO BE ON THE SET AND WEBSITE AND IT IS THIRTEEN GENERALLY THERE FOR THE RIGHT AGE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA COS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW OF MY TWELVE YEAR OLD IS ON IT DOES IT REALLY MATTER
IN A FEW MONTHS' TIME THEY'LL BILBY AT THE LEAP THAT THERE WAS NOT A LEGAL AGE AT THE MINIMUM AGE ANYWAY THEIR TERMS TO CONDITIONS DO STIPULATE A MINIMUM AGE OF THIRTEEN FOR CHILD IS ON AN INSTAGRAM OR A FACEBOOK SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT THEY HAVE BROKEN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND IF REPORTED OR FOUND OUT THEY COULD BE REMOVED FROM THAT SERVICE SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS EMPHASISED TO CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE DESPITE THEIR AGE THAT IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE AT THE RIGHT AGE TO BE ON THE SERVICES
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE THINGS ONLINE THAT CAN UPSET A CHILD AND THERE OUR AGE RESTRICTIONS FOR A REASON IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT CHILDREN KNOW WHERE TO GO TO IF THEY SEE SOMETHING ONLINE THAT DOES WORRY THEM FOR EXAMPLE SO AS LONG AS PARENTS ARE AWARE THAT THEIR CHILD IS ON A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT THEY NEED TO SIT WITH THEIR CHILD AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE PRIVACY SETTINGS HAVE OPEN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR CHILDREN SAY THAT THEY CAN REALLY KEEP EACH OTHER SAFE ONLINE OH WHAT ABOUT YOUTUBE TUBE WHICH WE KNOW NOW IS IS THE WAY THAT LOTS OF CHILDREN CONSUME
TELEVISION CONTENT OF OF ALL KINDS SO HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT POLICING YOUR CHILDREN'S USE OF YOUTUBE I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO PARENTS KNOWING WHAT CHILDREN ARE DOING ONLINE IF YOU'RE A PARENT AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOUR CHILD IS ON YOUTUBE OR WHAT THEY'RE USING YOU CHEAP FOR ENGAGE THEM IN A POSITIVE CONVERSATION FEATHER USING YOUTUBE FOR FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE TO WATCH ALL KINDS OF PERFECTLY HARMLESS THINGS AND YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE SITTING THERE WITH THEM OF COURSE THERE ARE PARENTAL CONTROLS ON SOMETHING LIKE YOU CHEAP THAT YOU CAN TURN ON OF COURSE WITH ANYTHING ONLINE
IT'S QUITE TRICKY TO POLICE THAT AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT LEAK THROUGH THE PARENTAL CONTROLS SO IT'S EQUIPPING CHILDREN WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO COME TO A PARENT OR A CARER IF THEY SEE SOMETHING THAT WORRIES THEM IT'S THEIR PARENTS' DUTY AS WELL TO KEEP TABS ON EXACTLY WHAT THAT CHILD AS A LOOKING AT SO MAYBE A QUICK CONVERSATION ASKING THEM WHAT THEY'RE DOING MAKING SURE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE SPIED UPON BUT MAKING SURE THAT TOGETHER THEY'RE USING THE INTERNET SAFELY
CAROLINE HURST FROM CHILD LET INTERNATIONAL THANK YOU THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND ROB'S HERE WITH THE SPORT MORNING ROB MORNING HERE SUPPORT CLEMENT HAS BEEN DISMISSED AS MANAGER OF DERBY COUNTY THIS FOLLOWING A SEVEN MATCH RUN IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP WITHOUT A WIN FOR THE CLUB SURELY STILL HAS HOPES OF PROMOTION THEIR FIFTH IN THE TABLE DERBY COUNTY
CHELSEA'S FRENCH INTERNATIONAL DEFENDER CUT THE ZOOMER LOOKS LIKE BEING OUT OF THE GAME FOR AS LONG AS SIX MONTHS HE SUSTAINED A SERIOUS LEG INJURY DURING SUNDAY'S GAME AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED AND WILL MISS NOT ONLY THE REST OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON BUT ALSO MOST LIKELY A PLACE IN THE FRENCH TEAM DURING EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN ON HOME SOIL
WE'RE NOT A CRICKET AND THE THIRD ONE DAY INTERNATIONAL TODAY IN CENTURION SOUTH AFRICA AGAINST AN ENGLAND SIDE WHICH LEAVES THE FIVE MATCH SERIES TWO NIL AND CAN THEREFORE CLINCH OVERALL VICTORY WITH A WIN TODAY SO THE REQUIREMENT FOR SOUTH AFRICA IS AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN SOUTH AFRICAN BATSMAN
A GOOD TEAM AND THEY BRING THE CRICKET BUT THE SAME TOKEN IF YOU GET THEM IN THE BORDER WE ORGANISED TO BALL I THINK WE'RE GOING TO USE WHATEVER SCORE I'VE DONE IS THEY COULD'VE WON THE CRICKET WE COULD REGARD FEEL THEN SUNTANNED IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO DEFEND THE WHATEVER THE CASE IS GOING TO BE OUR BEST GAME AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF THE DAY FOR US
AND THEY'LL BE MATCH COMMENTARY ON TEST MATCH SPECIAL OF COURSE STARTING ELEVEN FIFTEEN AND SIMON MANN FROM THE COMMENTARY TEAM IS ON THE LINE SO MANY SCENE A LOT OF ENGLAND HAVEN'T YOU OVER THE YEARS MUCH OF IT I SUPPOSE A DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE BUT BY WAY OF CONTRAST HAVE YOU EVER SEEN QUITE SO BUOYANT AND POSITIVE
I THINK THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING ENGLAND TEAM I'VE SEEN IN MY BROADCASTING CAREER I'M NOT SURE IT'S THE BEST ENGLAND TEAM HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ENGLAND TEAMS THE PAST HAVE REACH WORLD CUP FINALS NINETEEN NINETY TWO BUT I'M THAT WEAK WE'VE GOT TO THE STAGE NOT SO MANY YEARS AGO WHERE YOU TURN UP FOR ONE DAY INTERNATIONAL YOU THINK OH IT'S ANOTHER ONE DAY GAME THESE DAYS YOU GO TO ONE DAY INTERNATIONAL REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF WATCHING THIS ENGLAND TEAM WITH A BIG TEST FOR THEM OF COURSE WILL COME WHEN THE CHAMPIONS' TROPHY COME BAN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN THE WORLD CUP IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BOTH THOSE TOURNAMENTS IN ENGLAND THEY'VE GOT A HUGELY ENCOURAGING YEAR SINCE THE SHAMBLES OF LAST YEAR'S WORLD CUP SO YOU MENTIONED THE LONG TERM THERE DEE DO YOU SENSE A STRENGTH AND A PERMANENCE IN THIS REVIVAL
WELL I THINK SO BECAUSE THE TEAM IS IF YOUNG THEY'VE GOT LOTS OF EXCITING YOUNG PLAYERS PLAYERS LIKE JOSH BUTLER JOE ROOT BEN STOKES I THINK IF THERE IS A FLAW IN THIS SIDE IT IS IN THE BOWLING THEY HAVE LOTS OF OPTIONS THAT'S ONE THE REASONS THEY'VE DONE VERY WELL HERE THEY HAVE SIX BOWLING OPTIONS SOUTH AFRICA ONLY HAVE FOUR BUT PERHAPS THE INDIVIDUAL QUALITY IS A LITTLE BIT LACKING I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE AREA AND HOW THEY GOT SOMEONE THERE CAN COME ON AND TAKE A WICKET WHEN A WICK IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE GAME I THINK THAT THAT'S THE ONE AREA
FIELDING THERE'S BEEN SOME ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT FIELDING IN THIS SERIES TO STUNNING CATCHES BY STOKES AND JORDAN TO GET RID OF THE VILLIERS AND THE BATTING LINE UP IS IMMENSE THEY'VE GOT DOWN TO NUMBER TEN WITH TREMENDOUS POWER AND THEY THEY GO FOR IT AS WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY THEY WANT TO PLAY THAT'S THE WAY THEY PLAYED SINCE THE WORLD CUP IS EXTREMELY REFRESHING IT'S REALLY EXCITING TO WATCH BUT NEVERTHELESS WITH DUE RESPECT TO THEIR HOSTS I SUPPOSE IT'S A FAIR QUESTION TO ASK WHERE THE SOUTH AFRICA ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING A PROPER TEST FOR ENGLAND
THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION THEY THEY HAVE GOT GOOD INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS THE LIKES OF SHE'S NOT BEEN A VERY GOOD FORM IN THIS SERIES TO VILLIERS WHO'S BEEN JUST NIPPED IN THE BUD WITH THOSE TWO EXCELLENT CATCHES THAT I MENTION THEY DON'T HAVE THE BOWLING OPTIONS THEY'VE GOT BOWLERS WHO WERE INJURED LIKE STAYING AND FOR LAND AND ALBERT WAS INJURED AT THE START OF THE SERIES THEY NEED TO REST MORECAMBE AND RIB ARDOUR THEY ARCHING OF NOT LOST
HURST AND ONE DAY SERIES AT HOME FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THAT GIVES AN INDICATION OF THE POTENTIAL FOR A BIG ACHIEVEMENT HERE IS THIS THE BEST SOUTH AFRICAN SIDE I'VE SEEN CERTAINLY NOT IF SHE'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE WEAKEST SO AFRICAN SIDES I'VE SEEN SINCE THEY CAME BACK TO INTERNATIONAL CRICKET IN THE EARLY NINETIES

THE MAIN INDEX OF SHARE PRICES IN JAPAN THE MIKADO IS CLOSED DOWN BY ALMOST FIVE AND A HALF PER CENT FOLLOWING BIG LOSSES YESTERDAY ON STOCK MARKETS IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES STOCK MARKETS IN CHINA AND HONG KONG WERE CLOSED FOR PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM WAS WARNED THAT IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR LABOUR TO REACH AN AGREED POSITION ON TRIDENT MY BURNHAM WHO BACKS THE RENEWAL OF TRIDENT TOLD US A REVIEW BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY EMILY THORNBERRY WAS SET TO BE VERY DIFFICULT
A B. B. C. SURVEY SUGGESTS THAT MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF TEN TO TWELVE YEAR OLDS HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS DESPITE MOST WEBSITES AND ABS HAVING AN AGE RESTRICTION OF THIRTEEN OR ABOVE NEWSROUND SPOKE TO A THOUSAND TEN TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS ACROSS THE U.K. AND FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY HAD ACCOUNTS ON SITES SUCH AS FACEBOOK SNAP CHAT AND INSTAGRAM
THE TIME IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO AID THE LEADERS OF SEVERAL CHARITIES WORKING WITH ELDERLY PEOPLE HAVE TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT AGE YOU CASE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN A CONCERN TO THEM FOR SOME TIME AND THAT THEY DECIDED NOT TO BE PART OF THE MERGER THAT CREATED IT THE TIE UP BETWEEN AGE CONCERN AND HELP THE AGED SIX YEARS AGO FOR THAT REASON AGE U.K. HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR RECOMMENDING ENERGY DEALS THAT WERE NOT THE CHEAPEST OPTION A REPORTER SEE MACA TETRA IS HERE WITH MORE ON THIS
YES MICHELLE LAST WEEK WE HEARD CLAIMS THAT AGE U.K. WAS MAKING MONEY FROM SELLING INSURANCE AND OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WEREN'T NECESSARILY THE CHEAPEST FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS FOR CHARITY STRONGLY REJECTED THE ALLEGATIONS BUT SINCE THEN MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING FORWARD SAYING THE COMMERCIAL ARM OF THE CHARITY HAS MADE THEM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE NOW I'VE SPOKEN TO SEVERAL C.E.O.S OF THE INDEPENDENT CHARITY AGE CONCERN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO MERGE AND BE PART OF AGE U.K. BUT MANY DECIDED AGAINST THE IDEA STEVE DE TH BRONZE AGE CONCERN IN EXMOUTH AND THIS IS WHY HE DECIDED TO STAY INDEPENDENT THEY WERE SOMETHING LIKE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HUNDRED SIXTY OTHER AGE CONCERN'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO CHOSE NOT TO POT AS YOU CAN AT THE TIME
I WOULD GUESS THAT MANY DOWN FELT THE SAME WAY THAT WE DID THERE WERE IMPLICATIONS THAT ANY COMMERCIAL TYRES WOULD BE PRODUCTS THAT COULD ONLY BE DEALT WITH BY AGE CONCERN AT THE TIME AGE U.K. ENTERPRISES AGAIN IS SOMETHING THAT WE FELT WASN'T QUITE ETHICAL TO A SMALLER LOCAL CHARITY WE WERE VERY MUCH THE CO FACE AND WE HAD CONSIDERED THAT AGE U.K. WOULD BE DOWN A ROUTE OF SELLING PRODUCTS
LIKE OTHERS I'VE SPOKEN TO HE SAID IT WAS IMPLIED THAT IF YOU WERE TO JOIN FORCES WITH AGE U.K. OR POKE FOLIO OF PRODUCTS WILL BE PROMOTED AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT BARRY DUKE IS THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF AGE CONCERN IN DEVON HE ALSO DECIDED AGAINST JOINING THE CHARITY
THESE COMMISSION DEALS WITH THE UTILITY BUSINESS ALL THOSE THOUGHTS TO SUPPLY FOR EXAMPLE A PERSONAL ALARM OR FINANCIAL PRODUCTS FOUND IN OUR OPINION COMPROMISE HER CHARITIES IMPARTIALITY SPECIALLY WHEN WORKING WITH OLDER PEOPLE
HOW DID YOU COME I MADE US A CONTRACTION OFF FURTHER REQUIRE THE TRANSFER OF OUR CLIENTS' DETAILS THROUGH THEM REQUIRED TO PERCEIVE LOSS OF INDEPENDENCE AS A CHARITY AND DID NOT OF SUITABLE MARGINS OF INCOME TO COVER OUR COSTS
I'M ONLY SURPRISED A GREATER INTEREST HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN BEFORE AND I HOPE THAT I WILL PUBLICLY HE WAS SURE ALL OLDER PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF BUT AFTER SIX YEARS THEY ARE STILL NOT BRAND OF PETRUSHKA
NOW AGE U.K. HAVE TOLD US IN A STATEMENT THAT THEY OFFER GOOD VALUE PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE RELIED ON BY OLDER PEOPLE IN A VOLATILE MARKET PLACE FOR EXAMPLE THEY SAY OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS HAVE NO CANCELLATION OR CHANGE FEES NO UPPER AGE LIMIT INTEREST FREE INSTALLMENTS THERE WHICH RECOMMENDED THEY SAY IN THE QI FIVE STAR RATINGS THEY ALSO SAY ANY NET PROFITS GO STRAIGHT TO CHARITABLE ACTIVITY SUPPORTING VITAL WORK FOR VULNERABLE OLDER PEOPLE
THANK YOU WILL WE HAVE REPEATEDLY ASKED AGE U.K. FOR AN INTERVIEW BUT THEY HAVE REFUSED TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME BUT WE'RE JOINED NOW BY DAN CURRY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF NEW PHILANTHROPY CAPITAL I THINK TANK THAT SPECIALISES IN THE CHARITY SECTOR AND ADVISES DONORS ON HOW TO USE THEIR MONEY HE RAN THE NUMBER TEN POLICY UNIT WHEN GORDON BROWN WAS PRIME MINISTER GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OF COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN CHARITIES BUT BETWEEN CHARITIES AND COMMERCIAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE ONES THAT AGE U.K.'S BEEN CRITICISED
I THINK SORT OF COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WON'T BEAT FOR EVERYONE AND CLEARLY SOME PEOPLE WHO YOU'VE JUST BEEN SPEAKING TO HER DIDN'T LIKE THEM BUT IN PRINCIPLE I DON'T SEE ANYTHING PARTICULARLY WRONG WHAT A CHARITY'S GOT TO DO IT'S GOT TO FOCUS ON ITS MISSION ON HELPING IT'S BENEFICIARY GROUP AND IF FOR INSTANCE IT CAN IT FINDS THAT TURKS BENEFICIARY GROUP IN THIS CASE OLDER PEOPLE BUT IT COULD BE PEOPLE WITH OTHER CONDITIONS ARE FINDING IT HARD IN THE MARKET TO FIND A GOOD DEAL ON A MOBILE PHONE OR ELECTRICITY OR SOMETHING AND THEY CAN DO A DEAL
WHICH IS A GOOD DEAL THEY CAN DIRECT THE PEOPLE THEY WANT TO HELP TOWARDS IT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT I THINK THEY'RE IMPROVING EXCEPT SOMETIMES THE DEAL THEY'RE RECOMMENDING ARE NOT THE CHEAPEST ONES THERE IS OF COURSE AN ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER IT'S A GOOD DEAL OR NOT AND I'M NOT GONNA COMMENT ON THIS THAT'S FOR THAT'S A TISSUE ISN'T IT THAT WOULD CHANGE YOUR ENTIRE PERCEPTION OF WHETHER THAT CAREER COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENT IS IS THE RIGHT THING MORALLY FOR A CHARITY TO HAVE I THINK IT'S GOT OF COURSE HE'S GOT TO BE A GOOD DEAL OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT HELPING A BENEFICIARY GROUP IF YOU'RE GUIDING THEM TO THE WRONG
AREA WHETHER IT'S A MORAL ISSUE AND I THINK SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT GET THAT WE JUST HEARING FROM FEEL IT'S MORALLY WRONG FOR CHARITIES TO GET INVOLVED IN FOR INSTANCE GUIDING THEIR BENEFICIARY GROUP TO A BIT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR THEY CAN GIVE THEM A GOOD DEAL AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT AS ONE OF THE JOYS OF THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR THERE SOME CHARITIES BUT DO GET MIXED UP IN DOING COMMERCIAL DEALS AND SO ON THEY THINK THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO PURSUE THEIR MISSION AND AS LONG AS THEY COULD DEALS WHICH LIKE THAT MATTERS THAT'S O.K. THERE'S OTHERS WHO FEEL THEY DON'T TOUCH THAT THAT IS ETHICALLY WRONG AND I THINK THAT'S FINE TOO
BUT AS FAR AS THAT THE CLIMATE IS CONCERNED ARE YOU SAYING THAT THAT THESE SORTS OF THINGS IN THIS DAY AND AGE AND CAN GIVEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF CHARITIES HAVE FUNDRAISING IS THIS NECESSARY TO AT LEAST LOOK INTO TWO COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT BRING IN THE MONEY
CHARITIES ARE HAVING A BIT OF A TOUGH TIME AT THE MINUTE THEY SEEM TO BE IN THE CENTRE OF A KIND OF MEDIA STORM WITH SOME LEGITIMACY AND SOME OF THE THINGS IN THE WAY THAT THEY WERE FUNDRAISING OVER THE OLIVE COOK AFFAIR BUT I DON'T THINK THAT LEGITIMISES GETTING MONEY ANY WHICH WAY IT COMES BUT I DO THINK IN A SENSE IF YOU COULD DO A DEAL WITH THE COMMERCIAL PLAYER WHICH WOULD HELP YOUR VIEW OF THE PEOPLE YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP
AND YOU ACTUALLY DON'T PURSUE THAT YOU'RE SORT OF LETTING THEM DOWN SO I THINK IT'S THEM THE MORAL ISSUE IS IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS CLEAR THAN THOSE IN THE CHARITY SECTOR WHO SAY WE ARE ABOUT A VOLUNTARY SOME WE DON'T TOUCH THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHATSOEVER THERE THAT KEEPS US PURE THAT'S THAT'S A POSITION BUT YOU MAY WILL BE LETTING DOWN THE VERY PEOPLE HE SAY YOU'RE THERE TO TRY AND HELP WITH THEN YOU HAVE TO BE TOTALLY UPFRONT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING DON'T YOU AND IN THIS CASE THIS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE ELDERLY POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE WEB EVEN MORE CARE IS NEEDED
YOU HAVE TO BE TOTALLY UP FRONT YOU HAD TO BE TOTALLY TRANSPARENT YOU HAVE TO GET THE BEST DEAL AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER IN THE AGE U.K. CASE THAT WITH THAT WAS THE SITUATION BUT I THINK OF CHARITIES GOT FRIGHTENED AWAY FROM THIS SAYING MY GOD YOU KNOW IF IF WE DO ANY SORT OF DEAL WHICH WE THINK IS GOING TO HELP HER BENEFICIARY GROUP BUT IF IF ONE THING GOES WRONG AND IT WILL END UP ON THE TODAY PROGRAMME OR SOMETHING AND THEY ALL RUN AWAY FROM THESE THINGS I THINK WITH BE LETTING DOWN A LOT OF BENEFICIARIES DONE CORI THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S TWENTY TO EIGHT AND TIME TO LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IS ONE OF SEVERAL TO EXAMINE THE PRIME MINISTER'S CLAIM THAT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD LEAD TO MIGRANT CAMPS IN ENGLAND LIKE THE JUNGLE IN CALAIS THE PAPER SAYS HIS SUGGESTION HAS BEEN UNDERMINED AFTER WAS TOLD BY FRENCH SAUCES THAT IT WON'T SCRAP THE BORDER ENTRANCE WHICH ALLOW U.K. STAFF TO CHECK PASSPORTS IN CALAIS
THE DAILY MAIL MAKES CLEAR ITS VIEW WITH THE HEADLINE CAMERON THE SCAREMONGER AND AN EDITORIAL CALLING IT BOCA SCARE TACTICS TO FRIGHTEN VOTERS IN STAYING IN THE E.U. BUT THE TIMES REPORTS THAT THERE IS SUPPORT FOR DAVID CAMERON SCENARIO FROM THE FORMER HOME SECRETARY LORD BLUNKETT WHO HELPED DRAW UP THE FRENCH BORDER DEAL IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IT ALSO QUOTES THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF KELLER IS SAYING WE'LL HAVE TO CANCEL HIS AGREEMENT BECAUSE ENGLAND
WOULD BE IN EUROPE ANY MORE MOST PAPERS INCLUDE DRAMATIC PHOTOGRAPHS ILLUSTRATING THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER OF STORM IMAGE IN THE SOME PICTURES WHAT IT CALLS A WAVE OF TERROR AS THE SEA SMASHED OVER A LIGHTHOUSE IN EAST SUSSEX WHILE THE GUARDIAN AND THE TIMES SHOW DIFFERENT VIEWS OF HUGE WAVES EXPLODING OVER THE SEA WALL AT PORTHCAWL IN SOUTH WALES MATT'S CARTOON IN THE TELEGRAPH STRIKES A LIGHTER NOTE HE'S DRAWN A BABY'S CHRISTENING WITH THE PROUD FATHER COMMENTING WERE CALLING HER IMOGEN BECAUSE OF HER TERRIBLE WIND
CAMERON'S MUM FIGHTS TORY CUTS IS THE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY MIRROR IT SAYS THE MARY CAMERON IS EIGHTY ONE HE SIGNED A PETITION AGAINST THE CLOSURE OF CHILDREN CENTRES BY CONSERVATIVE COUNCIL IN OXFORDSHIRE JILL HERE SHE RUNS THE CAMPAIGN TOLD THE PAPER IT SHOWS HOW DE POSTERITY IS CUTTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE WHEN EVEN DAVID CAMERON'S MUM HAS HAD ENOUGH MISSUS CAMERON A RETIRED MAGISTRATE CONFIRM THAT HER NAME WAS INDEED ON THE PETITION BUT WOULDN'T DISCUSS IT FURTHER WITH THE MIRROR THE PAPER SAYS IT'S A CASE
MUM KNOWS BEST THE DAILY TELEGRAPH REPORTS ON A NEW DISPUTE OVER THE FAMOUS KOHINOOR DIAMOND THAT'S PART OF THE CROWN JEWELS IT WAS MINED IN INDIA HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO FOUND ITS WAY TO QUEEN VICTORIA AND IS PART OF THE CROWN ONCE WORN BY THE QUEEN MOTHER THE PAPER SAYS A BRITISH TRAINED PAKISTANI LAWYER HAS NOW BEGUN A LEGAL CLAIM TO HAVE THE GERM RETURNED TO PAKISTAN CLAIMING THAT IT WAS STOLEN THE PAPER POINTS OUT THAT THE AUTHORITIES IN INDIA HAVE ALSO DEMANDED THE JEWEL BE RETURNED TO THEM SETTING THE STAGE
FOR A COMPLEX THREE WAY DISPUTE BRITAIN HAS CONSISTENTLY REJECTED THE CLAIMS LETTERS UNEARTHED IN THE B.B.C. ARCHIVE GET COVERAGE IN SEVERAL PAPERS INCLUDING THAT EXPRESS THEY REVEAL THAT SIR TERRY WOGAN WHO DIED LAST WEEK WAS TWICE REJECTED BY THE B.B.C. INDEPENDENT SHOWS THE SECOND LETTER HE WROTE ASKING ABOUT A JOB IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE HE RECITE RECEIVED A POLITE REJECTION FROM DAVID AT SABRA THEN CONTROLLER OF B.B.C. TWO ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY'D ALREADY GOT ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO CAME FROM DUBLIN
THE TIME IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW IT'S ALL BEEN A RIDDLE FACING THE SCIENTIST WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES A TINY ANCIENT BACTERIUM SINCE LIGHT AND MOVE TOWARDS IT WELL THE ANSWER APPARENTLY IS THAT THE WHOLE ORGANISM AXE MY CAN ONLY BOIL FOCUSING LIGHT PROFESSOR CONRAD MONEY NO IT'S FROM THE QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY IN LONDON CO THE STUDY REALLY I EYEBALL YES ABSOLUTELY SO THEY WORK ARE VERY MUCH LIKE THAT
IT'S A VERY IT'S A VERY MUCH SMALLER SYSTEM SO A BACTERIUM IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED BILLION TIMES SMALLER THAN A HUMAN EYEBALL BUT IT WORKS AND ESSENTIALLY VERY MUCH THE SAME WAY SO IF IT FOCUSES LIGHT AND FOCUS IS AN IMAGE OF A LIGHT HOW I'M SURE IT'S COMPLICATED ANSWER BUT WHAT'S IN A SIMPLE VERSION OF IT HOW CAN YOU TELL HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING WE SAW THIS BY ACCIDENT SO WE WERE VERY PUZZLED ABOUT HOW THE BACTERIA COULD SEE WHERE THE LIGHT WAS COMING FROM
AND THE MORE WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE MORE PUZZLED WE GOT
BUT BY ACCIDENT ACTUALLY WE JUST LOOKED AT THEM UNDER A MICROSCOPE WITH AN UNUSUAL ILLUMINATION FROM THE SIDE AND WE NOTICE THAT EACH CELL'S LIKE A TINY LENS SO WE COULD ACTUALLY SEE A FOCUS SPOT OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CELL FROM THE LIGHT AS YOU CAN SEE WHAT HE'S DOING NO OTHER POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THIS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH COULD IT IN SOME WAY CONTRIBUTE TO KIND OF HUMAN ADVANCEMENT
WELL WE DIDN'T SET OUT WITH THAT IN MIND WE WERE JUST VERY VERY CURIOUS AND PUZZLED ABOUT THE QUESTION BUT IT IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THESE OPTICAL EFFECTS THAT WE SAW SO SPHERICAL BACTERIA LIKE LITTLE LENSES AND SOME OF THE ELONGATED ONES SEEM TO BE LIKE FIBRE OPTICS
IT SEEMS TO US THAT THIS MUST HAVE A BIG EFFECT ON THE AMOUNT OF HOW LIGHT IS ABSORBED FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS SO IF WE WANT TO EXPLOIT PHOTOSYNTHETIC BACTERIA BETTER AS SOME SOLAR POWERED
CELL FACTORIES THEN I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT SO WE CAN WE CAN MAKE THEM INTERACT MORE EFFICIENTLY WITH THEIR LIGHT FURTHER PROOF THAT SOME OF THE BEST DISCOVERIES ARE MADE SLIGHTLY BY ACCIDENT YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR COMING AND JOINING US AND TELLING US ABOUT IT PROFESSOR MILLIONAIRE THERE OF QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY IT'S NOW A QUARTER TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IN THE SPEAKER AND A GLASGOW STUDIO THIS MORNING IS JOHN BELL OF THE IONA COMMUNITY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
IT WAS FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN I WORKED IN THE NETHERLANDS THAT I FIRST BECAME AWARE THAT BRITAIN DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS I HAD A FRIEND CALLED YOURSELF WHO LIKE MANY YOUNG DUTCH PEOPLE SPOKE SEVERAL LANGUAGES FLUENTLY HE WAS STUDYING CRIMINOLOGY AND WAS OCCASIONALLY CALLED ON BY THE POLICE TO HELP THEM AND TO A FEW FRENCHMEN SPANIARDS WHO'D BEEN ARRESTED THE POLICE WERE KEEN WHEREVER POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THOSE UNDER INVESTIGATION FROM SPENDING EVEN A MATE IN THE SALE
IT WASN'T THAT THE DUTCH WERE SO OFTEN CLAIM RATHER THEY WANTED TO ENSURE THAT ONLY THOSE WHO SERIOUSLY MEDITATED INCARCERATION SHOULD BE LOCKED UP THEN AS NOW MOST EUROPEAN NATIONS HAD LABELS OF IMPRISONMENT FAR BELOW THAT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
I NEVER THOUGHT THE PRESENCE WHETHER LEGITIMATE FEES INTEREST UNTIL I REALISED HOW MANY OF THE STARS IN THE RELIGIOUS FERMENT IN THE PAST AND PRESENT HAD BEEN BEHIND BARS PEOPLE LIKE JEREMIAH JOHN THE BAPTIST PETER POLE ALL THE WAY UP TO MARTIN LUTHER KING OF COURSE YOU MAY ARGUE THEY NEVER DID ANYTHING REALLY WRONG BUT TO SOME EXTENT RAKE AND DRAWN OUT ON A VARIABLE SPECTRUM
WHETHER IT'S THE POETS WHO WROTE THIS SAM'S THE AUTHORS OF THE BOOK OF ISAIAH OTHER ONCE OF JESUS THEMSELF THERE'S AMPLE WITNESS THAT ONE OF THE PASSIONS OF GOD HAS TO LIBERATE THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT BE PRESENT
PEOPLE WHO I KNEW FOR TEN YEARS AND TELL HAS PREMATURE DEATH PERHAPS THE MOST GIFTED INTELLECTUAL I'VE EVER MADE IT AS A CHILD HE'D BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED NEGLECTED AND DEBARRED FROM CONVENTIONAL SCHOOLING
YET WHILE INCARCERATED HE TAUGHT HIMSELF GREEK THEIR GERMAN PHILOSOPHERS AND THEOLOGIANS AND WON A PLACE AT UNIVERSITY HAS UNDATED ABILITIES WERE NEVER IDENTIFIED OR ENCOURAGED AND PLEASANT NOT AND EIGHT SO WAS HE PREPARED FOR FREEDOM I ONCE ASKED THEM HOW MANY MEN AND HIS WHEN FELT WERE UNABLE TO READ OR WRITE OR MAY HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF ABUSE EARACHE AND ARROW AND A THUMB
SO IT'S WELCOME NEWS OF THE PRIME MINISTER AS RETHINKING PENAL POLICY WELL WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO PRESENT PEOPLE WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT HAVE PRESENT STOP BEING REFERRED TO AS ESTABLISHMENTS WHICH CULTIVATE CRIMINALITY AND INSTEAD THEY COULD BECOME VALUED FOR REFORMING LIVES AND DEVELOPING POTENTIALS FOR SELF ESTEEM RESPONSIBLE LOVING AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP
AND JESUS GREAT PARABLE OF THE SHEEP AND THE GOATS ARE KING AND DATES THE SELF RIGHTEOUS BY LISTING ALL THE GOOD TO THE FIELD TO DO AND RESPOND STILL APPLY AMONG OTHER THINGS WHEN DID WE SEE YOU AND PRESENT I'M NOT HERE FOR YOU
WELL MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE PRISONS AND THEIR PRACTICES HAVE HAD SUCH A LOW AND NEGATIVE PUBLIC PROFILE THAT WE ALL MATE CLAIM IGNORANCE OF THEIR SHORTCOMINGS
IF FOR THE GOOD OF US ALL HAD BECOME MUCH MORE PART OF POWER POSITIVE PUBLIC CONCERN AND CONVERSATION WE MAY BE SPEARED THE CENSURE OF HEAVEN
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH JOHN BELL THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO WAIT LEAVE THE E.U. AND MIGRANT CAMPS WILL OPEN ON THESE SHORES THAT WAS THE STARK CLAIM OF THE PRIME MINISTER YESTERDAY HIS ARGUMENT THAT FRANCE WOULD TEAR UP THE TREATY WHICH IN EFFECT MOVE THE BRITISH BORDER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL THEY STAY WITH THE REACTION OF A MAN HE USED TO SERVE IN MY CAMERON'S CABINET FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY AND PROMINENT LEAVE CAMPAIGNER LIAM FOX
IT IS NONSENSICAL IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE SCAREMONGERING BUT WHAT'S WORSE IS PLAIN WRONG
THIS WAS A TREATY THAT WAS MADE BETWEEN THE BRITISH AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS HAVE GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE E.U. AND WHAT'S MORE THE FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER MADE VERY CLEAR IN OCTOBER LAST YEAR
THAT IT WOULD NOT BE TO FRANCE'S ADVANTAGE TO TEAR THIS AGREEMENT UP IT WOULD SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL TO PEOPLE SMUGGLERS IT WILL RESULT IN A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE
IT WOULD RESULT IN A BIG PROBLEM FOR FRANCE WITH MORE PEOPLE ACTUALLY COMING TO CALAIS
WELL UNTIL LAST MONTH A MAN IN PARIS THE U.K.'S AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE IN OTHER WORDS WAS SIR PETER RICKETTS BEFORE THAT HE WAS THE PRIME MINISTER'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORY REJOICES IN STUDENT MORNING TO YOU SIR PETER GOOD MORNING NOW THERE WE HEARD LIAM FOX QUOTES THE FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER BERNARD GAZZA YOU ONLY A MATTER OF MONTHS AGO SAID WE DON'T WANT TO TEAR UP THIS BALL TO TREATY WERE NOT INTERESTED IN DOING THIS IT WAS A STUPID THING TO DO SO WAS THE PRIME MINISTER SCAREMONGERING
NO UM THIS TREATY BILATERAL TREATY BUT IT WAS MADE IN THE MULTILATERAL CONTEXT WHERE BRITAIN AND FRANCE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER ACROSS A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES IN THE INTERIOR JUSTICE AREA POLICE CO OPERATION AND SO ON IF THE CONTEXT CHANGED AND BRITAIN MADE A MAJOR DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. AT THAT I THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT FRANCE WOULD REVIEW ITS POSITION AS WELL AND WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO
BEAR IN MIND WHAT FRANCE IS DOING THAT IT'S GOT A THOUSAND OF ITS CRACK RIGHT POLICE DEPLOYED AND CARRY FAR MORE IN MARSEILLES THEY ARE BOTTLING UP EFFECTIVELY SEVEN THOUSAND OR MORE MIGRANTS IN THE COUNSELLOR AND KELLY THEY'RE TAKING A LOT OF POLITICAL FLAK FOR THAT THERE'S A LOT OF HUMANITARIAN PRESSURE ON THEM THEY DOING IT EFFECTIVELY TO PROTECT OUR BORDER
WE GET A SECURE BORDER THE FRENCH CARRY A LOT OF THE LOAD THEY DOING IT BECAUSE THEY SEE US AS A VERY IMPORTANT ALLY IN THE E.U. ON A WHOLE RANGE OF AREAS OF CO OPERATION POLICE AND CRIME IF THAT STOPPED THEN I THINK THE INCENTIVES CHANGE FOR FRANCE
QUITE SIMPLY THEY SAY THERE'S NOTHING IN IT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE YOUR BORDER ON OUR SHORES MEANING THAT THAT JUNGLE CAMP THE CAMP THAT WE SEE DOWN THE COAST AS WELL AT DUNKIRK THERE'S NOTHING IN OUR INTEREST AS FRENCH THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO KEEP THAT GOING
YES IT WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE ALREADY IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY IN FRANCE THEY CALL THAT RICK REPUBLIC UP INCLUDING THE MAN HE'S JUST BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE REGION THAT INCLUDES CALAIS THEY ARE OPENLY CALLING FOR THIS TREATED THE NEW TOOTHY TREATY WHICH ESTABLISHES THE BORDERS IN FRANCE TO BE ABROGATED THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT GETTING A SIX MONTHS' NOTICE AND I THINK IF WE CHANGE THE CONTEXT BY LEAVING THE E.U. THE FRENCH ARE BOUND TO LOOK AT THAT AGAIN
AS OF NOW MY COUSIN HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUSLY STAUNCH ALLY IN WORKING WITH US TO HELP MANAGE THOSE BUSHES AND KALLIE BUT FOR THE FUTURE I THINK THAT COULD CHANGE A HEART I CAN HEAR PEOPLE SAYING IF THEY'RE NOT SHOUTING AT THEIR RADIO THIS IS THE BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY ESTABLISHMENT DOING WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN PRO THE E.U. THEY CLUB TOGETHER THEY WARN TERRIBLE THINGS WILL HAPPEN IF WE DARE TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT OUR OWN DESTINY IN OUR OWN FUTURE WE'RE AN ISLAND FOR GOODNESS SAKE OF COURSE WE CAN PROTECT UPWARDS
I'M THE GUY WHO WAS PAID INTO LAST MONTH TO BE OUR MAN IN FRANCE TO UNDERSTAND THE FRENCH YOU KNOW WHAT THEY MIGHT BE THINKING AND I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S A HUGE INCENTIVE FOR FRANCE TO GO ON PAYING THE POLITICAL PRICE THE PRICE IN TERMS OF POLICE RESOURCES TO DEFEND BRITISH BORDER
IF THE U.K. DECIDES TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAVE THOSE MIGRANTS THEY DO WANT TO STAY IN FRANCE THE FRENCH DON'T YOU WANT THEM IN FRANCE AND THERE'S A STRONG POLITICAL FEELING IN FRANCE
THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO MOVE THE BORDER BACK TO THE U.K. AND WE CAN DEAL WITH THE MIGRANTS NOW AS I MENTIONED USED TO BE DAVID CAMERON'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVICE HE DID THAT JOB OF COURSE WHEN HE TOOK A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION TO ATTACK LIBYA LEADING TO THE FALL THAN DEATH ULTIMATELY OF COLONEL GADAFFI THERE IS TALK ONCE AGAIN ISN'T THERE IN THE CAPITALS OF THE WEST
OR TAKING FURTHER MILITARY ACTION AGAINST LIBYA WHAT MIGHT BE THE RATIONALE NOW FOR ACTING OF COURSE NOT AGAINST THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT NOW BUT AGAINST THE FORCES OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IN THE COUNTRY
WHEN THE ACTION WE TOOK IN TWENTY ELEVEN I THINK WAS RIGHT BECAUSE IT STOPPED THE BLOODBATH IN BENGHAZI IT GAVE THE LIBYAN OPPOSITION GROUPS A CHANCE TO GET TOGETHER FORM A COHERENT GOVERNMENT WITH A COHERENT SECURITY STRUCTURE AND BASICALLY REINVENT THEIR COUNTRY
THEY FAILED TO DO THAT WHICH IS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
BUT NOW BECAUSE OF THE UNGOVERNED SPACE THERE IT'S A THREAT TO ALL OF US IN EUROPE AS YOU SAY ISIS IS MOVING IN SO THERE IS A CASE FOR DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY AND
HELP THEM PRODUCE STABILITY IN LIBYA THEY'VE GOT TO DO IT I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD OF BRITISH COMBAT FORCES
BEING DEPLOYED SEEMS TO ME TO BE VERY VERY REMOTE BUT I THINK SUPPORTING THE LIBYANS IN DOING A MORE EFFECTIVE JOB OF GOVERNING THEIR OWN SPACE I CAN CERTAINLY SEE THE RATIONALE FOR THAT SUPPORTING TO GOVERN THEIR OWN SPACE WHICH COULD MEAN FURTHER AIR STRIKES AND COULD MEAN DECISIONS TO TRY TO PROTECT THOSE HUGE OIL AND GAS RESERVES
THAT MATTER TO EUROPE SO MUCH I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT TO MAKE BRITISH MINISTERS SAY WILL BRITISH POLICY IS BUT I THINK WE CAN ONLY DO ANYTHING IF THERE IS AN EMERGING LIBYAN SECURITY STRUCTURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY CAN'T BRING SECURITY TO LIBYA HERSELF THAT IS THE DEBATE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT THAT IS HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT THERE IS NOT CURRENTLY A LIBYAN GOVERNMENT THERE IS NO DEAL INDEED THERE ARE TWO HAVE BEEN U.N. EFFORTS TO TRY TO BRING ABOUT SOME AGREEMENT
DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO SIMPLY TO WAIT UNTIL THERE'S A SHARED STRUCTURE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY JUST SAY LOOK THE THREAT TO THE WEST IS SO GREAT IN TERMS OF A TERRORIST BASE IN TERMS OF THE THREAT TO THE OIL AND GAS RESERVES THERE WHICH IS GOING TO MILITARILY INTERVENE ANYWAY WELL I THINK WE CAN SUPPORT THEY KNOW WE CAN BE PART OF THE PROCESS AS WE HAVE BEEN WITH THE UN TO PRODUCING STRUCTURE THAT WE CAN GET BEHIND
BUT I THINK AIR STRIKES JUST ON THEIR OWN IN A VACUUM WITHOUT DRIVING TOWARDS SOME SORT OF LIBYAN LEAD SECURITY STRUCTURE ON GOING TO ACHIEVE VERY MUCH NOW I ASK YOU THIS IN PART BECAUSE NATO MEETS TO DISCUSS SOME OF THIS TOMORROW WE'VE GOT A FOREIGN AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY ABOUT
WHETHER THE POLICY WAS RIGHT YOU'LL KNOW THERE'LL BE PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS PROGRAMME SAYING FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T DO ANY MORE MILITARY ACTION LOOK HOW MESSED UP IT WAS AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN YOU'VE JUST SAID YOU THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING THE DECISION YOU WERE INVOLVED IN BACK THEN WHY SO GIVEN THE CONSEQUENCES SEEM SO DISASTROUS
FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE WE DID STOP A BLOODBATH IN BENGHAZI WE DID GIVE THE LIBYAN INSURGENCY AGAINST GADDAFI THE OPPORTUNITY FIRST TO OVERTHROW GADDAFI AND THEN TO COME TOGETHER TO REINVENT THEIR COUNTRY AFTER THOSE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF DISASTROUS GADDAFI RULE THEY HAVEN'T DONE A VERY GOOD JOB WITH THAT
BUT I THINK WE'VE STILL GOT TO BE THERE TO TRY AND SUPPORT THEM IN THAT DIRECTION AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY SIMPLY THIS IS ALWAYS PREDICTABLE WHENEVER THE WEST GETS INVOLVED IN THE MIDDLE EAST THEY ALWAYS MAKE THINGS WORSE THEY ALWAYS GENERATE ANGER THEY ALWAYS IN EFFECT SPONSOR THE CREATION OF THE VERY PEOPLE WHO THEN COME AND ATTACKERS A YEAR TWO YEARS THREE YEARS LATER WELL THAN WE'VE HAD IN THIS CONVERSATION THOSE WHO ARE SUPPORTING MORE MILITARY ACTION NOW AND AS YOU SAY THERE'LL BE THOSE WILL BE AGAINST ANY FURTHER MILITARY ACTION
I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT TO BRITISH MINISTERS TO WORK THAT OUT TO MAKE THAT DECISION BUT YOU KNOW YOU JUST FINALLY FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU DON'T THINK THE EXPERIENCE OF TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN SHOULD MAKE IT IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES OPPOSED TO EVER USING MILITARY ACTION AGAIN IN LIBYA OR ON THE WIDER MIDDLE EAST I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE YOUR DECISIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME
SO WATCH THIS SPACE ABSOLUTELY YES AND IF WE DID YOU WERE IN PARIS DO YOU THINK IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE AMERICANS WANT THE BRITISH THE FRENCH AND OTHERS TO JOIN IN MILITARY ACTION DO YOU THINK THEY'D BE LIKELY TO DO THAT
AGAIN I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT I THINK IF WE HAVE SOME EMERGING LIBYAN SECURITY STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THEN I'M SURE THAT THE THREE COUNTRIES ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT TOGETHER AND WE WERE ALL I THINK HAVE A SENSE THAT WE OUGHT TO BE PART OF FINDING A SOLUTION SIR PETER RICKETTS THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US ABOUT THAT AND INDEED OF COURSE ABOUT THE BORDER AND KELLY THANK YOU THANK YOU
THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND THEN RICH IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER THEN THANKS VERY MUCH MICHELLE WELL A SIGH OF RELIEF I THINK FOR MANY TODAY BECAUSE AFTER STORM IMAGE IN BROUGHT SUCH PROBLEMS YESTERDAY TODAY LOOKS CONSIDERABLY CALMER THERE'LL BE A CHILLI FEAR IT'LL STILL BE QUITE BREEZY AND WE'LL SEE SHOWERS OR LONGER SPELLS OF RAIN IN PLACES

THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT IF YOU TURN UP TO A HOSPITAL ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT YOU WILL GENERALLY BE SEEN WITHIN FOUR HOURS BUT IF YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM THERE IS NO SUCH TARGET EVEN ONCE DIAGNOSED IT IS FAR FROM CERTAIN THAT YOU WILL GET AN ADEQUATE STANDARD OF CARE CLOSE TO WHERE YOU LIVE
A REPORT INTO INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC CARE IN ENGLAND SAYS THAT SOME SEVERELY ILL PEOPLE ARE TRAVELLING HUNDREDS OF MILES TO GET THE HELP THEY NEED DAMAGING THEIR CHANCES OF RECOVERY OR THE REPORT AUTHOR WAS THE CROSS BENCH PEER LORD CRISP THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF N.H.S. ENGLAND AND WE'LL SPEAK TO HIM IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST WE'RE JOINED FROM A SALFORD STUDIO BY LAURA NOT OR WHO IS TWENTY FIVE AND HAS A LONG TERM MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION GOOD MORNING O.K. WHEN WERE YOU FIRST DIAGNOSED I WAS DIAGNOSED AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN AFTER A YEAR IN HOSPITAL
WE SPENT A YEAR IN HOSPITAL YEAH IT'S ALL USED AS AN ADOLESCENT
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT WANT ONCE YOU WERE YOU WERE DIAGNOSED HOW DID YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL IN ORDER TO TO GET THE HELP YOU NEED WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO YOU AND BACK THERE
THERE WAS MORE CARE AVAILABLE WHEN I NEEDED MORE INTENSIVE CHI MEANT IN TERMS OF A SECURE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE I WAS SO DETERMINED TO END MY LIFE AT THAT TIME I DID HAVE TO TRAVEL FROM LINCOLNSHIRE TO KENT THAT THAT WAS A SPECIALIST SERVICE SO IT WASN'T SO MUCH A CASE OF BEDS NOT BEING AVAILABLE HOW OFTEN DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT WELL I WAS IN THAT HOSPITAL FOR SEVEN MONTHS SO IT WAS A CASE OF
WELL MY FATHER DRIVE IT DOWN WHEN YOU WANTED TO SEE ME OR IF I HAD WEEKEND LEAVE IT BE A CASE OF TRAVELLING AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I GOT MY TWENTIES IT WAS ACTUALLY LAST NOVEMBER THAT I EXPERIENCED HAVING TO TRAVEL DUE TO A LACK OF BEDS AND AND THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO NOW
IT WAS YEAH BUT I WHEN I BECAME UNWELL IN NOVEMBER IT WAS DECIDED THAT I NEEDED TO GO INTO HOSPITAL AND WHERE I AM IN LINCOLNSHIRE THERE WHERE NEIGHBOUR TO NOWHERE NE BEDS IN SURROUNDING COUNTIES AND I HAD THE CHOICE BETWEEN MANCHESTER AND LONDON
AND YOU ENDED UP GOING TO TO MANCHESTER TO BE ADMITTED YEAH WE FELT THAT MANCHESTER WOULD BE EASIER TO GET TO THE END SORT OF CENTRAL LONDON AND HOW DIFFICULT WAS IT WILL BUMP PARTICULARLY ALSO FOR YOUR FAMILY FOR THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT YOU NEEDED TO HAVE TO TRAVEL THAT SORT OF DISTANCE IT WAS REALLY HARD BECAUSE UP UNTIL THAT POINT MY FAMILY HAD BEEN MY
MY CARERS AND THEY WERE LITERALLY CARING FOR ME TWENTY FOUR SEVEN STAYING AWAKE THROUGH THE NIGHT AND SUDDENLY I WAS FAR AWAY AND THEY COULD SORT OF KEEP AN EYE ON ME AND MAKE SURE THAT HOWEVER WELL SEE HOW I WAS DOING REALLY AND ALSO IT WAS HARD FOR ME BECAUSE THE FAMILY SUPPORT AND SUPPORT AND FRIENDS AS WELL IS A MASSIVE CONTRIBUTOR TO YOU
I DON'T KNOW RECOVERING FROM A REAL ABSOLUTELY WELL AND YOU'RE OUT OF HOSPITAL NOW AS YOU LOOK BACK DO YOU THINK THEY'D KICK I DO YOU KNOW THAT WAS A SPECIALIST UNIT IN AND IT WAS THE RIGHT PLACE FIT FOR YOU TO BE DO YOU THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT SOLUTION FOR YOU EVEN THOUGH YOU HAD TO YOU HAD TO TRAVEL THAT GREAT DISTANCE AND YOUR FAMILY DID AS WELL
IT WASN'T A SPECIALIST UNIT IT WAS JUST AN ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH UNIT AND I DID RECEIVE FANTASTIC CARE AND LOOKING BACK NOW THEY TRAVEL IN THE DISTANCE WASN'T IDEAL I CAN'T FOLD TO THE HOSPITAL AND THE TREATMENT I DID RECEIVE
LISTENING TO WHAT YOU'VE HAD TO SAY IS NIGEL CRISP LORD CHRIS THE AUTHOR OF THE REPORT THAT HAS EMERGED TODAY AND THE TRAVELLING OF LONG DISTANCE DISTANCE IS ONE THING THAT YOU LOOKED AT BUT OVERALL IT IS A PICTURE OF OF OF PEOPLE FINDING IT REALLY HARD TO GET THE HELP THEY NEED
YES IT IS WE HEARD A NUMBER OF STORIES LIKE LAURA NETTLES ONE JUST WHEN WE WERE DOING THIS REPORT AND THAT THE PICTURE'S EMERGES IS WHY DO WE TREAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY WE TREAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SEVERELY PHYSICALLY ILL AND WE WOULDN'T EXPECT TO TRAVEL A LONG WAY FOR A HEART ATTACK OR A STROKE SO FOR GENERAL
ACUTE CARE AND LAURA METAL MAKES THAT POINT CAREFULLY IT SHOULD BE DELIVERED LOCALLY AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A NUMBER OF TRUST MANAGED TO DO THAT
THERE ARE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN SOME AREAS BUT NOT NECESSARILY EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS REAL SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THERE'S THE BEGINNING TO BE THE POLITICAL WILL TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN YES AND IN IS THAT THERE'S A BIG REPORT COMING OUT IN THIS NEW MONEY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAS A PLEDGED TO MENTAL HEALTH BUT THE TRUST THAT YOU SAY ALL GETTING THIS RIGHT WHAT ARE THEY DOING WELL
YOU HAVE TO THINK OF BEDS HAS BEEN PART OF A CONTINUUM OF THE SERVICE AND IN MANY PLACES THERE THEY MAY BE ABLE TO DEVELOP ALTERNATIVES TO GOING INTO HOSPITAL GOING TO HOSPITALS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST THING FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE IT CUTS THEM OFF EVEN IF IT'S THE LOCAL HOSPITAL IT MAY BE IF THEY LOSE THEIR TENANCY IF THEY'RE RENTING A HOUSE THEY MAY LOSE THEIR JOB YOU KNOW THOSE SORT OF THINGS MAY HAPPEN TO THEM
SO IDEALLY YOU TRY AND HAVE HOME TREATMENT SO IN A LOT OF TRUSS YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING TREATMENT AT HOME WITH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE THEM TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY SO YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE RIGHT NUMBER OF BEDS AND THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HOME TREATMENT AND PEOPLE ARE GETTING THAT BALANCE RIGHT IN SOME PLACES BUT IT'S ALSO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE TRUST'S IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM SAYING THIS IS A PRIORITY
IT'S ABOUT COMMISSIONERS THAT'S THE PEOPLE WHO PLANNED THE SERVICE RECOGNISING THAT WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS RIGHT AND THAT IT'S TIME THAT WE WE HAD A REAL CHANGE IN MIND AND YOU SUGGESTED ONE WAY TO GET THAT CHANGE IN MINDSET IS TO HAVE SOMETHING AKIN TO THE FOUR HOUR ANY WAITING TIME TARGET THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THERE IS A THING CALLED THE N.H.S. CONSTITUTION WHICH MAKES CERTAIN PLEDGES TO PEOPLE AND THEY MAKE A PLEDGE ABOUT ONLY WAITING FOR HOURS IN A. AND E. WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE A PLEDGE ABOUT ONCE IT'S BEEN DECIDED YOU NEED TO BE ADMITTED AND YOU'RE SEVERELY ILL
THEN THAT SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN FOUR HOURS AS WELL OR YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS HOME TREATMENT WITHIN FOUR HOURS SO YOU'RE NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT HOW NEAR TO USE THAT TO A PATIENT THAT BED NEEDS TO BE A FAT BEDS A LONG WAY WHEN YOU SPEND MOST THOSE FOUR HOURS GETTING THAT WOULD NO I'M SORRY THAT WE MET TWO RECOMMENDATIONS THERE ONE IS ABOUT THE FOUR HOUR WAIT AND THE SECOND ONE IS THAT WE SHOULD PHASE OUT LONG DISTANCE TRANSFERS
A LONG DISTANCE THING WHAT WELL ACTUALLY WHAT WE SAY IS THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE DETERMINED LOCALLY IN CONSULTATION WITH PATIENTS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE IN A RURAL AREA IT MAY BE REASONABLE TO TRAVEL RATHER LONGER NOT FROM SALFORD TO LINCOLNSHIRE AND AS WE HEARD JUST THEN THEN IF YOU ARE IN ISLINGTON FOR EXAMPLE SO IT NEEDS TO BE DETERMINED LOCALLY BUT WE ARE BUT WE DO KNOW THAT N.H.S. ENGLAND
HAS ACTUALLY ALREADY STARTED WORK ON GETTING THE DEFINITIONS FOR THIS RIGHT SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A NATIONAL FRAMEWORK AND THEN LOCAL PEOPLE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT'S ACCEPTABLE WHAT'S REASONABLE IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HERE THERE'S A THERE'S A SORT OF TRADE OFF BETWEEN HAVING CARE CLOSE TO AND PERHAPS GETTING THE BEST POSSIBLE SPECIALIST CARES IF THE N.H.S. IS TRYING TO DEVELOP SPECIALIST CENTRES
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BY THEIR VERY NATURE THEY CANNOT BE EVERYWHERE YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE POINTS TO CONGREGATE YOUR RESOURCES IN IF YOU DON'T LIVE NEAR ONE OF THEM THEN IT IS GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THAT'S I THINK THE POINT THAT LAURA METAL MAKES THAT ACTUALLY THE SPECIALIST SERVICE SHE WENT TO WAS AN ADOLESCENT WAS A LONG WAY AWAY THAT'S A SORT OF EQUIVALENT IF YOU LIKE OF THE HEART TRANSPLANT BUT THE HEART ATTACK
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DEALT WITH IN YOUR LOCAL HOSPITAL AND WHILST WE SLAY PEOPLE SEE THAT AS A SPECIALIST SERVICE DON'T WAY ACTUALLY IT'S A SORT OF SPECIALIST SERVICE THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE LOCALLY AS OPPOSED TO THE REALLY SPECIALIST SERVICE WHICH IN MENTAL HEALTH MAY BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES OR SOME KIND OF INTENSIVE CARE THAT PEOPLE NEED
BUT FOR GENERAL ACUTE CARE THE EQUIVALENT AS I SAY OF THE STROKES OF THE HEART ATTACKS THAN THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE ACCESSIBLE LOCALLY AND I ATE GIVED YOU ARE A FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF N.H.S. ENGLAND AND WE'RE TWENTY FOUR HOURS AWAY FROM ANOTHER DOCTOR'S STRIKE IF YOU WERE STILL IN YOUR OLD JOB WHICH SIDE IN THIS DISPUTE WOULD YOU SAY NEEDED TO COMPROMISE THE B.M.A. OR JEREMY HUNT
I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT CLOSE TO IT BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS DISPUTE IS THAT
THIS ISN'T I THINK JUST ABOUT THE TECHNICALITIES OF THE DISPUTE I THINK THIS IS ABOUT JUDY DOCTORS FEELING UNDERVALUED UNLOVED AND NOT CARED FOR IT'S REMARKABLE THAT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT
OF JUNIOR DOCTORS VOTED IN FAVOUR OF THE STRIKE THAT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT AND I THINK THAT'S A SET I THINK THIS DISPUTE IS A SYMPTOM OF SOMETHING ELSE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WHEN THE WRIST PEWTER'S RESOLVED THAT THE GOVERNMENT ARE LEADERS OF THE HEALTH SERVICE WILL SIT DOWN WITH THE JUNIOR DOCTORS EVERYWHERE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT THE REAL ISSUES ARE AND WHY IT IS THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ON WHOM THE FUTURE OF
THE N.H.S. DEPENDS TO A LARGE EXTENT AS WELL AS NURSES AND OTHERS OF COURSE THAT ACTUALLY WHY ARE THEY FEELING SO DISGRUNTLED SO UNHAPPY WITH WHAT A FANTASTIC JOBS BECAUSE ACTUALLY I'M NOT A DOCTOR
BUT BEING A DOCTOR IN MANY WAYS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST JOBS IN THE WORLD THAT RATHER SUGGEST THAT YOU THINK JEREMY HUNT SHOULD BE MORE CONCILIATORY PERHAPS AT THIS WELL I THINK THAT THERE ARE WIDER ISSUES HERE AND I THINK THEY I HAD NOWHERE NEAR ANY OF THE DISCUSSION HERE CAN I MAKE ONE OF THE FINAL POINT ON THIS THOUGH WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS WITH MENTAL HEALTH IS WE END UP TALKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IF I MAY JUST GO BACK TO TO MENTAL HEALTH FOR A MOMENT I THINK JUNIOR DOCTORS IN MENTAL HEALTH IN A REALLY DIFFICULT
POSITION AT THE MOMENT COS THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO CARRY THE BURDEN OF TRYING TO FIND BEDS FOR PEOPLE SO I THINK THE SORT OF THING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ABOUT MAKING THAT EASIER USING THE NEW MONEY THE GOVERNMENT SAID HE'S COMING AND THERE ARE
AND THE POLITICIANS WERE VERY MUCH I THINK ONSIDE WITH THIS I THINK WILL EASE THE SORT OF SITUATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LORD CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW A TWENTY PAST EIGHT LET ME JUST BRING SOME NEWS THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM GERMANY IS ABOUT A VERY SERIOUS TRAIN CARE CRASH SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE DIED AFTER TWO TRAINS COLLIDED IN THE SOUTHERN GERMAN STATE OF BAVARIA THE PEOPLE HAVE SAID IT LOOKS AS IF THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED HAVE BEEN INJURED AND TWO PEOPLE HAVE DIED OBVIOUSLY IT'S A SERIOUS SITUATION THAT TRAIN CRASH UP JUST BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK AND IF WE GET MORE ON THAT WILL BRING IT TO YOU
AT THE TIME AT TWENTY PAST EIGHT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY YOU MAY RECALL YESTERDAY ON THE PROGRAMME JIM WAS REPORTING ON HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SAUNDERS HIS RACE TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT BUT LET US CONFESS WE HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM SOME PEOPLE LISTED ON A MONO RADIO ONLY HEARD THIS
THEY KNOW I DON'T GET BURNED I DON'T GIVE UP I BELL IN THE ARENA AND I AM PREPARED TO MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT HAVE A REP I ACADEMY AGAIN
WHAT WAS MISSING WAS THIS THIS WILL NOT BE AN EASY FIGHT THEY HAVE ENDLESS SUPPLIES OF MONEY AND POWER
WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE WE HAVE
AND IT DIDN'T END THERE IT'S AS IF THE REPUBLICAN ARGUMENT ABOUT BELIEF AND IDEA OF AMERICA THAT PULSES WITH THE MOTION NEEDS BURNING ON THE OTHER SIDE IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS THEY'RE SAYING THE SAME THING LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS
AND OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT YOU TO MISS ANYTHING ON THIS PROGRAMME AS JIM SAYS WE DO ALL NEED BERNIE SO HIS LISTENERS WITH STEREO RADIOS HEARD INSTEAD WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE LIKE SOUNDED LIKE FOR EVERYBODY
OUR MOST IMPORTANT TASK IS TO REVITALISE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE POLITICAL PROCESS IS THE MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE
BY WHICH THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE FEEL DRAWN UP TOP AND WHEN WE DO THAT WOULD CHANGE
TO CHERYL'S YOU SEE ARE BETTER THAN ONE BUT SOMETIMES TWO CHANNELS CAN GET MIXED INTO ONE SPEAKER AND IF YOU'RE STILL PUZZLED ABOUT WHAT AN EARTH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT MEANS THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO HERE YESTERDAY NOTHING VERY MUCH AT ALL ON TOMORROW MORNING'S PROGRAMME WE'LL HAVE GYMS REPORTS ON THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARIES INCLUDING BERNIE SANDERS FULL AND UNINTERRUPTED
WE HOPE FOR AND IF WE GET IT WRONG YOU CAN ENJOY A FEW SECONDS OF SILENCE INSTEAD I WAS LISTENING AT HOME YESTERDAY MORNING BUT OF COURSE I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME AND MY INTERNET CONNECTION SO NOW NOW I KNOW AS WELL WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED AT THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT NEVER TRIED TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
WHY ISN'T IT RIGHT TO TAKE IT IN SYRIA THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT THE MINISTER'S POSE JUST A FEW MONTHS BACK BUT COULD ANOTHER QUESTION BECOMING SUIT IF IT'S RIGHT IN A RACK AND IT'S RIGHT IN SYRIA WHY NOT LIBYA WHERE THREE THOUSAND NICE FIGHTERS ARE SAID TO HAVE AMASSED AND AFRAID TO BE READY TO STRIKE AGAINST AND TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR COUNTRY'S VITAL OIL AND GAS FIELDS
FRANK GARDNER IS THE B.B.C. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT JOBS ON THE LINE AND WERE ALSO JOINED BY BALLS OOH DARK SKIP FORGIVE ME DARA GAZZA WHO IS BELL'S FEEDS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT AND RECENTLY RETURNED FROM LIBYA FRANK FIRST OF ALL HOW SERIOUSLY IS THE POSSIBILITY OF MILITARY ACTION NOT NECESSARILY AIR STRIKES OF COURSE BUT MILITARY ACTION BY THE WEST BEING TALKED OF IN LIBYA
TALKED ABOUT IN WASHINGTON THE PENTAGON ARE VERY KEEN TO DO MORE THAN THEY'RE DOING AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE WAITING FOR ORDERS FROM THE PERSON WHO IS VERY RELUCTANT TO GET INVOLVED IN YET ANOTHER
I FIDDLED ISLAMIC STATE COULD BE RECRUITED AND TO COME AND JOINED THEIR RANKS THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD
BUT IN LIBYA ELLA'S HERS I'M SURE THE OTHER CORRESPONDENT WALK WELL UH BUILDER TELL YOU IT'D ABSOLUTE BASKET CASE OF DIFFERENT COMPETING RIVAL MILITIAS YOU CAN'T JUST GO BLUNDERING IN
THE MOST EXTREME WHICH MOVE
INTERNATIONAL ARE YOU WESTERN MILITARY BOOTS ON THE GROUND
TO WORK WITH THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS FINDING A CREDIBLE FOR THAT REPRESENT THE LIBYAN PEOPLE I WAS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OH KATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO TO BALLS OH DEREK YOU MY APOLOGIES FOR PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME WRONGLY TO THEIR FIRST UP WHO WAS A SAY HAS JUST RECENTLY RETURNED FROM LIBYA WE HEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN DON'T WE ABOUT THESE COMPETING THESE WARRING FACTIONS TO GOVERNMENTS MANY MORE FACTIONS OF COURSE HOW TURBULENT HOW TRAUMATIC WAS IT WHEN YOU WERE IN THERE BE A REASON
I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT EVEN JUST TO GOVERNMENT ANY MORE NOW YOU HAVE THREE GOVERNMENT IF YOU COUNT THE U.N. BACK TO TUNIS BASED GOVERNMENT THAT THE U.S. AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES HAVE ENDORSED IT'S BASED IN FIVE STAR HOTELS IN AT THIS POINT IT HAS NO CREDIBLE FORCES ON THE GROUND SO IT'S A REAL MASS AND NONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOGNISE EACH OTHER IN A DISH AND WITHIN EACH OF THE GOVERNMENT'S SO TO SPEAK WITHIN EACH OF THE
CALL THIS INTO CAMPS THERE'S A SPLINTERING EFFECT GOING ON SO FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT IN TRIPOLI WHICH HAD THE SUPPORT OF MILITIAS AND POLITICAL ORGANISATIONS IN TRIPOLI AND MIZ WRITER IT'S COMING APART WITH MANY PEOPLE AND MIZ RIOTER GOING THEIR OWN WAY AND YOU ALSO HAVE HUGE SWATHES OF THE COUNTRY FOR EXAMPLE BUNNY WELL LEAD WHICH IS A CITY TO THE SOUTH EAST OF THE CAPITAL TRIPOLI WHICH RECOGNISES NONE OF THE GOVERNMENT
THEY RUN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS AND EVEN HAVE THEIR OWN FLAG AT THIS POINT SO IT'S A REAL COMPLICATED SITUATION AND IT'S GETTING IN SOME WAYS MORE FRAGMENTED BY THE DAY
THE CONCERN IN WESTERN CAPITALS IS NOT JUST THE AMASSING OF ALL THOSE I S. FORCES BUT ALSO THE THREAT TO OIL AND GAS SUPPLIES THE ECONOMIST RECENTLY SAID THAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN SOONER RATHER THAN LATER THE TIMES EDITORIAL AT THE WEEKEND SAID MILITARY ACTION SHOULD NOT BE DELAYED BEYOND THE SPRING THIS IS NOT MISSION IMPOSSIBLE
AND IN SOME WAYS IT IS MISSION IMPOSSIBLE AT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO HEAR IT YOU'RE GOING TO HIT HER I S. HEADQUARTERS IN CERT THERE HAVE THAT EVERY DAY THEY ARE BRINGING HUNDREDS OF STATE EMPLOYEES INTO THE HEADQUARTERS TO SERVE HUMAN SHIELDS THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HEARING
ARE YOU GOING TO PUT TROOPS ON THE GROUND HOW MANY TROOPS IN WHAT CAPACITY IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF A EASY MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF ISIS IN LIBYA AND YET ON THE GROUND WITH WIPER YOU'RE TALKING SOMEWHERE LIKE LIBYA URGING I'M SORRY YOU'VE GOT
WHAT IS SOMEONE ENCOURAGING IS THE THREAT OF ISIS ITS BRUTALITY ITS VICIOUSNESS THE STORIES OF WHAT IT'S DOING TO THE AREAS UNDER ITS CONTROL AND ITS TERROR ATTACKS ON ALL LIBYAN FACTIONS ARE SORT OF FOCUSING ATTENTION ON THE PART OF LIBYA'S FRAGMENTED NASCENT SINCE SECURITY FORCES ON THE THREAD OF IS SO THAT WHEN I WAS THERE IN MAY OF LAST YEAR
PEOPLE WERE UNDERPLAYING THE ISIS THROUGHOUT THIS IS NO BIG DEAL ALL THE WEST IS OVER PLAYING IT AND NOW YOU HAVE A MUCH DIFFERENT ATTITUDE MUCH MORE SHARPER FOCUSED ATTITUDE ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS MESS ON THE GROUND BUT STILL BECAUSE OF THOSE POLITICAL DIFFERENCES BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL FRAGMENTATION THERE
FRANK GARDNER WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE HOPE OF CREATING A COHESIVE STRATEGY AGAINST ACES BAUZA DARRA GUY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND ROB'S HERE WITH THE SPORT THANKS MICHELLE GOOD MORNING AGAIN WILL TOP LINES THIS MORNING INCLUDE A KNEE INJURY OF CHELSEA'S FRENCH INTERNATIONAL KURT ZOOMER WHICH LOOKS SO SERIOUS THAT HE SET THEM IS NOT ONLY THE REST OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON BUT ALSO THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS IN THE SUMMER AND THERE'S ALSO THE DISMISSAL OF DERBY COUNTY MANAGER PAUL CLEMENT HE PRESIDED OVER A RUN OF SEVEN MATCHES WITHOUT A WIN IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP
ALSO HANGING BY A THREAD YOU'D IMAGINE GARY NEVILLE FORMER MANCHESTER UNITED AND ENGLAND DEFENDER NOW IN CHARGE OF VALENCIA TRADITIONALLY ONE OF SPAIN'S MORE POWERFUL CLUBS BUT FALLING DEEP NOW INTO THE BOTTOM HALF OF LOVELY GIRL FOLLOWING A RUN OF NINE GAMES WITHOUT A WIN UNDER NEVILLE'S INEXPERIENCED LEADERSHIP AT TOMORROW'S TEAM FACES BARCELONA IN THE SECOND LEG OF THEIR SPANISH CUP TIE THEIR SEVEN NIL DOWN AFTER LAST WEEK'S FIRST LEG
AND THEY GOING TO THE MATCH AFTER YET FURTHER HUMILIATION AT THE WEEKEND DEFEAT BY RAIL BUT IT'S STILL NEVILLE REMAINS DEFIANT THERE'S NO DOUBT AT TIMES LIKE THIS IT'S A IT'S A MOMENT WHERE EVERYONE IS TO STAY TOGETHER I AGREE THAT NO EVERYONE SHOPPERS
MORE THAN EVERYONE BUT WE STUCK WITH THEM I CONTINUE TO WORK I CONTINUE TROP BELIEF AND CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ODDS OF BETWEEN
SO THE QUESTION FOR SPANISH FOOTBALL JOURNALIST BEGONIA PALACES SIMPLE ENOUGH HOW MANY MORE DEFEATS CAN VALENCIA'S OWNER TAKE WELL THAT'S A TRICKY QUESTION BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE EXPECT THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE IN CHARGE STILL WERE IN THESE SECOND LEVEL OF THE SEMI FINAL OF THE SPANISH CUP AGAINST RATS
HE'S BASICALLY LOST ALL HIS CREDIT AFTER IN GETTING DEFEATED AS WEAK AND I DEFEAT AGAINST BETTY'S LAST WEEKEND THAT LEFT NEVVY NOBODY FLIES OPUS JUST BUT THEN REALITY IS THAT THE OWNER OF THE CLUB BE DUDLEY HAS THE LAST WORKS AND HE'S THE ONE THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY USING SINGAPORE
HE HAS TO MAKE THOSE YOU'RE ALWAYS VERY GOOD FRIENDS WE ARE AND BASICALLY HE WAS A WELL APPOINTED HE'S RESISTING ALL THE CALLS TO SATURN AT THE MOMENT SHE'S BEING QUITE INDULGENT ISN'T IT REALLY I MEAN ANY OTHER MANAGER YOU'D IMAGINE AT LEAST A MANAGER NOT WITH THE SAME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OWNER WOULD HAVE GONE BY NOW
YEAH AND TO BE HONEST EVERY HAS BEEN VERY DEFIANT AS WELL CHRISSIE'S THING ALDOUS CALLS I MEAN PEOPLE ARE CALLING HIM TO RESIGN
THERE IS A PLANNING PRAISE ACTUALLY TO REPLACE AND THE SPORTS DIRECT OFFICE WAS THAT'S THE UPPY CUT HAS ALREADY SOMEONE IN MIND TO REPLACING POISE KWANG AROUND WAS THE FORMER MANAGER BUT NO ONE HAS THE POWER TO SACK THE GARY NEVER USE ONLY THE OLDER AND BASICALLY HE IS RESISTING OLDER MORE GENERALLY BIGGER DEER A BRITISH MANAGERS HELD IN HIGH REGARD IN SPAIN THERE IS A LONG TRACK RECORD GOING BACK TERRY VENABLES JOHN TOSHACK AND THEN MORE RECENTLY DAVID MOYES

THE WEATHER IS GOING TO BE A DAY OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS WITH THE WINDS EASING YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH MICHEL A SANE AND NICK ROBINSON TIME NOW THIRTY THREE PAST OF THE VERSE TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE AND TIME FOR A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM NEIL SLEET
AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION HAS URGED THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND TO STOP SENDING MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS HUNDREDS OF MILES FOR CARE THE COMMISSION WAS CHAIRED BY A FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE HEALTH SERVICE LORD CHRIS WHO TOLD US THAT NEEDED TO BE BETTER PLANNING OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND A CHANGE IN MINDSET IN THE N.H.S. THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS CRUCIAL THAT PEOPLE RECEIVED THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CARE THEY NEEDED AS CLOSE TO HOME AS POSSIBLE
THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM HAS TOLD US IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR LABOUR TO REACH AN AGREED POSITION ON THE TRIDENT NUCLEAR DETERRENT HE SAID THE PARTY'S REVIEW OF DEFENCE POLICY WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT POLICE IN SOUTHERN GERMANY SAY SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AND SERIOUSLY INJURED IN A TRAIN CRASH SEVERAL CARRIAGES ARE REPORTED TO HAVE OVERTURNED WHEN TWO TRAINS COLLIDED NEAR BART I PLING IN BAVARIA
TURKEY SAYS THE NUMBER OF SYRIAN REFUGEES HEADING TOWARDS ITS BORDERS COULD RISE TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MANY PEOPLE ARE FLEEING AN UPSURGE IN FIGHTING AROUND THE NORTHERN CITY OF ALEPPO
POLICE IN HONG KONG SAY FIFTY FOUR PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED DURING PROTESTS LAST NIGHT IT'S THE WORST UNREST IN THE TERRITORY SINCE THE PRO DEMOCRACY PROTESTS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NEIL IS THAT TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE TRIDENT COULD SOON BE AS OBSOLETE AS THE SPITFIRE THAT'S WHAT LABOUR M.P.S WERE TOLD LAST NIGHT BY THE WOMAN CHOSEN BY JEREMY CORBIN
TO HELP PERSUADE THEM TO CHANGE THEIR PARTY'S POLICY ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS GIVEN THAT THEIR LEADER WAS ELECTED AS A LIFELONG SUPPORTER OF UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT THIS WAS WHAT ONE OF THOSE YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY TWEETED STRAIGHTAWAY AFTERWARDS OH MY GOD OH DEAR
OH DEAR I THINK I NEED TO GO LIE DOWN AND DOTMAN DREW THAT WAS THE LABOUR M.P. MADELEINE MOON A LONG SERVING MEMBER OF THE DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE AND A REPRESENTATIVE AT THE NATO POT LAST WEEK I WAS IN WASHINGTON
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OTHER TWENTY EIGHT NATIONS WHO WERE THERE THE BIG QUESTION THEY WANTED TO ASK WAS WHAT DOES YOUR PARTY DOING WHAT ARE YOU SAYING BECAUSE
THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN NATIONS SEE IT AS PART OF THEIR DETERRENTS TOO THEY SEE IT AS PART OF THEIR SECURITY AND THEIR VERY WORRIED
EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME MICHELLE SPOKE TO THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM WE ALWAYS KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT DEBATE FOR THE PARTY THERE ARE TWO POSITIONS HERE THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONCILE AND THE PARTY'S GOT TO FIND SOME WAY OF OF ACCOMMODATING THOSE POSITIONS AND MOVE FORWARD AND NOT LET THIS ISSUE TAKE OVER EVERYTHING HOW COULD IT
RECONCILE THOSE THOSE TWO POSITION I SAID I THINK IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ISN'T IT THERE'S SOME HYBRID OPTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE FOUND THAT THEY THEY JUST DON'T WORK
WELL HERE WITH US HE'S THE SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY EMILY THORNBERRY GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING THOUGH YOU MAY DISAGREE ON LOTS OF THINGS BUT WERE YOU TEMPTED TO AGREE WITH YOUR COLLEAGUE MADELEINE MOON AFTER THAT MEETING AND THINK OH MY GOD I WANT TO LIE DOWN IN A DARKENED ROOM
IT'S A HARD JOB THAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN I ACCEPT THAT IT'S A HARD JOB BUT I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE PROCEED WITH GOODWILL AND IF WE ARE PREPARED TO GO INTO THIS AND LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE THE EVIDENCE WILL DRAW US TO CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS AND WE NEED TO HAVE ALL THE OPTIONS ON THE TABLE AND WE NEED TO HAVE A PROPER DEBATE WITHIN THE PARTY
AND OBVIOUSLY I MEAN IT'S IT'S BEEN WELL WELL REHEARSED FOR FIVE PERHAPS POSSIBLY SIX PEOPLE AT THE PEEL PEEL LAST NIGHT KICKED OFF BUT I DON'T THINK THEY NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE WHOLE OF THE PARLIAMENT YOU KNOW THEY SAID YOU WERE LIVING IN LALA LAND YOU SAID WERE WAFFLY THEY WERE NO THEY WERE NOT TO FLATTER IT WORKED LET'S FOCUS ON THE SUBSTANCE YOU TALK ABOUT THE EVIDENCE WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAID TO THEM THE TRIDENT MIGHT ONE DAY LOOK AS OBSOLETE AS SPITFIRE
I WAS EXPLAINING WAS THAT IT HAD BEEN I HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND TOLD THAT IT WAS EITHER TRIDENT OR NOTHING IT WAS A BINARY OPTION AND OUR VIEW IS THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BINARY OPTION WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT ALL THE POSSIBILITIES AND I SAID THAT HERE THERE ARE QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE TO BE ASKED ABOUT TRIDENT AND THERE ARE FORTHCOMING JET ARE GENERATIONS ARE DRAINS THE CAN THE CAN WORK UNDER SEIZE THE MOMENT THEY HAVE TWO PROBLEMS ONE IS COMMUNICATIONS AND THE OTHER IS BATTERY LIFE
I WAS EXPLAINING TO THE P. L.P. THAT I'D ACTUALLY MET ONE OF THE YOUNG TURKS AT THE MOMENT WHO IS DEVELOPING THESE TRENDS AND THEY ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO BUT ACTUALLY THE SEAS WILL NO LONGER BE OPAQUE THE IDEA OF EARTHY TRIDENT REPLACEMENT IS THAT IT CAN HIDE IN THE SEA
IF TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING FASTER THAN THAT THEN IT MAY WELL BE THAT TRIDENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HIDE AND IF THAT'S RIGHT
THEN IF WE ARE TIPPED HER BET EVERYTHING ON MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION WE HAVE TO BE ASSURED THAT IT'S GOING TO WORK
AND IF HE CAN'T HIDE ME MORE THAT IS A PROBLEM AND IT IS RIGHT FOR THE OPPOSITION BEFORE COMMITTING OR VOTING FOR HER COMMITMENT WHICH WOULD COST ACCORDING TO CRISPIN BLUNT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT BILLION POUNDS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS SO WHAT I WAS SAYING TO PROBLEM FOR TRIDENT THERE ISN'T IT IN OTHER WORDS I'M PUZZLED BY YOU SAYING THERE FOR IT'S NOT A BINARY OPTION NOW THAT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD ARGUMENT ADDED TO LOTS OF OTHER PURPLY GOOD ARGUMENTS THERE MIGHT LEAD PEOPLE TO SAY
DON'T WASTE THE MONEY DON'T SPEND MONEY ON A DETERRENT YOU CAN NEVER USE AND THAT MIGHT BE DETECTED WHAT IT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO SAY IS THAT DOES IT THERE'S A MIDDLE POSITION BETWEEN HAVING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND NOT HAVING NUCLEAR WEAPONS I THINK THAT WE JUST HAVE TO I THINK THAT AS A SAY THE POINTERS AS THAT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WHICH IS A PERFECT OPTION I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE WE NEED TO PICK IT UP AND LOOK AT IT HONESTLY AND SAY
THIS IS IT THIS THIS HAS CERTAIN ADVANTAGES AND THERE'S A CERTAIN DISADVANTAGES ALTHOUGH IT WAS THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CHALLENGE THOSE WHO WERE SAYING IT HAS TO BE TRIDENT I MEAN LEADING US WE JUST PUSH THIS ON THIS THERE IS JEREMY CALLING WAS OPEN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES ONE WAS TO HAVE SUBMARINES WITHOUT MISSILES OF COURSE THAT IS STILL JUST A BANDING ON NUCLEAR DETERRENT MAYBE A GOOD THING BUT IT'S NOT A MIDDLE POSITION IS
WELL THERE ARE THERE'S MORE SUBTLETIES TO JET TWO TO SOME THINGS THAT JEREMY WAS SUGGESTING THAT WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS I DON'T WANT TO START HE DISCUSSING HEAR ON THE RADIO THE PROS AND CONS OF ALL THE VARIOUS OPTIONS AND PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DRAWN YESTERDAY AT THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY BUT IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WERE PEOPLE SAYING EMILY THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE TO TRY THEY STAY EVEN IF YOU CAN'T SPELL THEM CONTRIBUTE I'M SURE BUT THEY EXIST THESE OPTIONS
THE OTHER OPTION IS IT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO YOUR COLLEAGUE FOR GOODNESS SAKES THE SHADOW WAS EDGES VERY SENIOR MAN ANDY BURNHAM SAID LOOK LET'S BE HONEST THESE ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONCILE THESE POSITIONS IS THE SIMPLE ANSWER STOP TRYING YOU KNOW THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS IN POLITICS JUST GO TO THE PUBLIC AND SAY SOME OF US WANT TO NUCLEAR DETERRENT SOME OF US DON'T AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL VOTE
I THINK THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID OF HAVING A DEBATE WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY AND ACTUALLY I THINK THIS IS A DEBATE HIS TIME HAS COME I THINK THAT IT'S A DEBATE THAT THEY THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO HAVE AND WE HAVE A WEBSITE AND WHICH WE ARE INVITING PEOPLE TO CONTRIBUTE AND WE WANT THERE TO BE A BIG DISCUSSION BEFORE SUCH A MAJOR DECISION IS MADE
DO YOU RULE OUT OLD LABOUR M.P.S GOING INTO A GENERAL ELECTION SOME WITH A MANIFESTO SAYING VOTE FOR US AND YOU DO GET TRIED NUCLEAR SUBMARINES AND OTHERS SAYING VOTE FOR US AND YOU DON'T
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE DISCUSSION FIRST BEFORE PEOPLE JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS WHEN YOU'VE GOT A VOTE TO TAKE PART IN VERY SOON POSSIBLY IN A MATTER OF WEEKS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THE TORIES PROBABLY WANT TO WRONG FOOT YOU ON THIS SO WILL YOU VOTE OR DO YOU THINK YOU'LL UPSTAGE
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AGAIN TO NOTE THAT THE TORIES ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS AS BEING A MAIN GATE DECISION A DECISION WHICH THERE'S A NO POINT OF RETURN IN RELATION TO TRIDENT AND THAT IS UNTRUE THEIR OWN SICK THEIR OWN REVIEW SAYS THAT THEY WILL NOT BE HAVING A MAIN GATE VOTE
SO IF THEY DO ASK FOR A VOTE WOULD BE A VOTE ON PRINCIPLE WE HAD A VOTE ON PRINCIPLE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THERE WILL BE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FAVOUR OF TRIDENT WHO WILL BE ASKING THE QUESTION WHAT ON EARTH HAVE THE TORIES BEEN DOING SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THAT WE NOW NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER VOTE IN PRINCIPLE IF THEY ARE NOT PLAYING GAMES WITH US WHY DON'T THEY GET ON WITH IT SO YOU THINK CITY DAPS THIS VOTE DON'T PLAY THE GAME
I THINK THAT THEY ARE THAT THAT IF THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR THEY ARE PLAYING GAMES WITH US AND WE ARE HAVING A LEGITIMATE REVIEW IN THE LABOUR PARTY ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IF THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT THEN I THINK THAT THAT DOES NOT SHOW THEM IN A GOOD LIGHT IN NATIONAL SECURITY IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND SHOULDN'T BE PLAYED WITH WELL IT'S IMPORTANT IT SHOULD BE PLAYED WITH I GUESS THAT'S THE PROBLEM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE ARE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING AT EVIDENCE WHERE THEY'VE GROWN UP CONVERSATIONS ON ON TIME FOR THE NEXT ELECTION AS HAD THE CONTRARY VIEW IS THIS
IT'S JUST NOT SERIOUS TO POSE AS AN ALTERNATIVE GOVERNMENT WITH A MAN WHO WANTS TO BE PRIME MINISTER WHO WE KNOW NOW WOULD NEVER USE TRIDENT WE ASSUMED BY THE WAY AS IF YOU WERE DEFENCE SECRETARY WOULD NEVER EVER THREATENED TO USE TRIED AND WOULD YOU
IF IF YOU COULD HAVE WEAPONS NEED TO BE THREATENED THAT THEY HAVE FAILED EVERYBODY SAYS THAT THE WHOLE POINT IS ABOUT YOU COULD WEAPONS AS THAT YOU DON'T USE THEM BUT HE FEEL YOU WOULDN'T LET A MALE ANYWAY WHATEVER THEN SECRETARY AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE TOO TO WORK AT ALL YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY WITH CONFIDENCE I HAVE A BIG STICK MY STEAK A STOUTER THAN YOUR STICK AND BOTH SIDES NEED TO BE CONFIDENT BUT ACTUALLY

WELL THERE YOU HAVE A LITTLE BLAST OF IT BUT WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM CARDIFF BYE DAVID STOUT WHO PLAYS FIGARO AND BY ELIZABETH WATTS WHO PLAYS THE COUNTER'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING GOOD MORNING DAVID START SO THERE IS NO HAPPY EVER AFTER FOR HAPPILY EVER AFTER FOR DOVER FOR F. FOR FIGARO WELL THERE MAY WELL BE IF IT'S GIVEN THAT TITLE BUT IT'S A TWISTY TURNY THING OPERA THE ENDING IS IF I DON'T GIVE IT AWAY BUT CERTAINLY NOT
WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT EXPECT GOOD GOOD IDEA TO HAVE TO KEEP EVERYONE GUESSING BUT FIGARO HIMSELF WHAT IS HE LIKE IN THIS SEQUEL COMPARED TO THE FIGARO THAT WE KNOW BEFORE FROM THE BARBER OF SEVILLE AND FROM FROM THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO WELL HE'S A REALIST I THINK THAT FIGURE OUT OF ALL THE CHARACTERS IN THE
IN THE BULL MUSHY TRILOGY IS PROBABLY THE ONE WHO'S MORE IN CONNECTION WITH REAL LIFE AND HIS OWN FEELINGS AND IN THE FURRED WE LEFT WITH
FOR PART OF THE TRILOGY WERE LEFT IN A SITUATION WHERE THE ALMAVIVA HOUSEHOLD IS NOT PARTICULARLY CONTENT AND WE ENTER INTO THE ELLEN LANGER AND DAVID PARTLY WORLD IN A STATE OF REVOLUTION IN NINETEEN THIRTIES AND THE ARM OF EVA'S ARE FLEEING FROM THEIR CASTLE
AND FIGURE HAS GREAT LOYALTY PARTICULARLY TO THE COUNTESS AND TRIES TO MAKE ENDS MEET BY REINVENTING HIMSELF AS AS THE BARBER HE WAS IT WHERE ELIZABETH YOU PLAYED THAT THE COUNTESS WHAT WHAT IS THE ATTRACTION TO YOU OF HAVING THIS SORT OF FOLLOW UP IF YOU IF YOU LIKE TWO TO MOZART

ON TWO AND UTILISE THE SAME SET OF SIMILAR COSTUMES SIMILAR PERSONNEL AND WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME THREE SUCCESSIVE NIGHTS AND COME AND SEE THE STORY PLAY TO ITS CONCLUSION AND ELIZABETH WHAT WHAT WHAT WAS IT WHAT WAS THE ATTRACTION FOR YOU WHEN I GET TO PLAY IT'S MY FIRST CAN TESTS AND I GET TO PLAY THE COUNTESS IN THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO AND THE COUNTESS IN DIVORCE THE TWO VERY DIFFERENT STYLES
WE'VE GOT THAT NORMAL MOZART ORCHESTRA EIGHT FOR THAT MARRIAGE OBVIOUSLY BUT THEN WE HAVE AN ORCHESTRA WITH AN ACCORDION FOR FIGURE GETS A DIVORCE MUSIC HAS ELEMENTS OF STRICTLY COME DANCING ALONG WITH ELEMENTS OF SHIN BURGH SO IT'S JUST A GREAT A GREAT MIX UP AND THEY'VE GOT GREAT SHOW SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON TO TALK TO US ABOUT ELIZABETH WATTS AND DAVID SPOUT OR DAVID STOUT AND IT'S A PART OF THE WELSH NATIONAL OPERA'S SERIES OF PRODUCTIONS
IT IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TONIGHT AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE DETAILS OF YOUR INTERNET BROWSING BEING STORED SO THE POLICE MIGHT ACCESS IT THAT POWER IS PART OF THE DRAFT INVESTIGATORY POWERS BILL WHICH IS BEING LOOKED AT BY A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE AT THE MOMENT AND AIMS TO OVERHAUL SURVEILLANCE AN INTERCEPTION PAT WAS THE COMMITTEE REPORTS ON IT THIS THURSDAY AND OR SECURITY CORRESPONDENT GORDON PEREIRA HE'S LOOKING AT SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES STARTING TODAY WITH WHAT ARE CALLED INTERNET CONNECTION RECORDS
IF I SAID CAN I LOOK AT YOUR INTERNET BROWSING WHAT WOULD YOUR REACTION BE NO EH NOT VERY SCIENTIFIC SAMPLE OF ONE PERSON AT A LOCAL INTERNET CAFE NONETHELESS HIGHLIGHTS THE TENSION'S MANY FEEL OVER INTERNET BROWSING WHY
IT'S A PERSONAL THING IN THAT IT'S LIKE THEM UP THROUGH SOME HIS DIARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IF THE POLICE SAID WELL WE WANT IT STORED SO THAT WE CAN INVESTIGATE CRIME
UM WELL IT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER I SUPPOSE ISN'T IT
DEPENDS ON ALMOST BE NEWS FOR THE DRAFT INVESTIGATE POWERS BILL PROPOSES FOR THE FIRST TIME KEEPING SO CALLED INTERNET CONNECTION RECORDS FOR A YEAR
SO WHY DOES LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT CHRIS PHEROMONES AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION IN THE NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE GOT IMMENSE VALUE FROM TELEPHONE RECORDS AND THEY HAVE BEEN IMMENSELY USEFUL IN SOLVING ALL SORTS OF CRIMES WERE NOW FACED WITH A POSITION WHERE
A LOT OF COMMUNICATIONS ARE BEING TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET LETS LET'S ASSUME FOR ONE SECOND WHERE INVESTIGATING YOU WHEN YOU USE A TRADITIONAL PHONE
AND YOU'RE GOING TO CONDUCT A SCIMITAR CRIMINALITY OVER OVER A PERIOD OF WE BELIEVE YOU ARE AND WE GET YOUR PHONE RECORDS AND IT SHOWS THAT YOU FOUND THE BANK OR PHONE A HIRE COMPANY FOR A CAR PHONE AN AIRLINE COMPANY TO BOOK A FLIGHT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ONCE WE'D IDENTIFIED THAT YOU PHONED THEM WE COULD THEN FOLLOW THEM UP IF YOU BOOKED THOSE THINGS THROUGH THE INTERNET
WE WOULD CURRENTLY GET IS THE RECORD TO SHOW THAT YOU CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET BUT NOTHING BEYOND THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T INVOLVE STORY PEOPLE'S FULL INTERNET BROWSING HISTORY BUT RATHER A RECORD OF THE WEBSITE'S UP TO THE FIRST SLASH IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULD SAY YOU'VE VISITED THE B.B.C. NEWS WEBSITE BUT NOT WHICH STORY YOU READ
EVEN THAT CRITICS ARGUE IT'S A STEP CHANGE RATHER THAN JUST AN UPDATE GRAEME SMITH IS A LEADING LEGAL EXPERT ON THE INTERNET AND PRIVACY INTERNET CONNECTION RECORDS REALLY GO FAR BEYOND AN ITEMISED PHONE BILL DID LOGS THE PLACES YOU'VE VISITED THE
PLACES YOU GO TO TO BUY THINGS THAT'S MUCH MORE LIKE GOING OUT OUTSIDE OUR FRONT DOORS AND HAVING A UNIVERSAL
C.C.T.V. SYSTEM AND THE WAY IT'S LEAST LIE ITEMISED PHONE BILLS IS THAT IT REALLY LOGS
OUR READING HABITS IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT IT IS ONLY UP TO THE FIRST SLASH SO IT'S RATHER LIKE SEEING A LIST OF ALL THE TITLES OF ALL THE BOOKS NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES THAT YOU BRED IS NOT EVERY PAGE IN EVERY BOOK YOU READ BUT IT'S ALL THE TITLES SO WHAT DO THE COMPANIES WHO'LL BE REQUIRED TO STORE THOSE RECORDS FOR TWELVE MONTHS I THINK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL
THEY'RE NERVOUS ABOUT BEING TOLD TO GENERATE AND THEN STORE SENSITIVE DATA NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT COULD BE A TARGET FOR HACKERS ANTHONY WALKER IS DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE INDUSTRY BODY TECH K. THESE ARE RECORDS OF YOUR ONLINE ACTIVITY AND THAT ALLOWS SIGNIFICANT INFERENCES TO BE DRAWN ABOUT YOUR POLITICAL PREFERENCES RELIGIOUS OR SEXUAL PREFERENCES VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION COMPANIES HAVE TO SCORE THIS INFORMATION WILL RECOGNISE THAT CALL THE OF BY THE CONSUMERS AND THEREFORE IT NEEDS TO BE KEPT VERY VERY SECURE
AND OF COURSE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND RISKS FOR COMPANIES IN IN HAVING TO HANDLE THAT DATA THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT IS BEING ASKED HERE WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS WOULD BE THE TECHNICAL IMPLICATIONS AND CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF THE COST IMPLICATIONS FOR COMPANIES ARE VERY CLEAR OTHERS FROM BUSINESSES DIRECTLY INVOLVED HAVE ALSO TOLD ME THEY'RE NERVOUS ABOUT THEIR COSTS AND FEES ABILITY AS WELL AS THE DANGER THAT THE CATEGORIES OF DATA THE STATE WANTS KEPT COULD BE EXPANDED
ALL OF THAT SIGNALS THAT INTERNET CONNECTION RECORDS MAY PROVE TO BE THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL OF ALL THE PROPOSALS IN THE NEW BILL
GORDON CAREER OF REPORTING THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO NINE WHEN LIVERPOOL PLAY WEST HAM TONIGHT THERE COULD BE MORE OF WHAT WE SAW AT THE WEEKEND LIVERPOOL FANS TEN THOUSAND OF THEM WALKING OUT OF THEIR MATCH AGAINST SUNDERLAND IN PROTEST AT AN INCREASE IN TICKET PRICES NEXT SEASON WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM MERSEYSIDE BY KEITH CALVIN WHO'S FROM THE SPIRIT OF SHANKLY LIVERPOOL F.C. SUPPORTERS UNION IT HELP TO ORGANISE THAT WALK OUT AND HE'S A MEMBER OF THE CLUB'S TICKET WORKING GROUP GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING DO YOU THINK YOU'RE NEGOTIATING HAND WITH THE CLUB HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED BY THAT WALK OUT I'M NOT ON PER CENT SURE ON THAT ONLY TIME WILL TELL THE CLUB OBVIOUSLY I'VE DECIDED TO
VISUALLY A BIT OF A AT MUM SHALL WE HAVEN'T BEEN BUCKING SORT SHOW WHO KNOWS BUT YOU HOPE YOU HOLD THE TICKET PRICES ARE TOO EXPENSIVE THE HIGHEST ONES ARE GOING TO BE SEVENTY SEVEN POUNDS NEXT SEASON ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A LOT OF MUCH CHEAPER TICKETS WILL KNOW THAT'S A BIT OF A FALLACY THAT THERE'S NOT A GREAT DEAL OF TICKETS THE CLUB ARE FIXATED ON THEIR LOWEST PRICE OF NINE BECAUSE SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY A NINE POUND TICKET
OUT OF NEARLY A MILLION SALES TICKETS IS LESS THAN NOUGHT POINT ONE TWO FIVE PERCENT AT THAT PLACE AND WHICH ARE BASICALLY GOING TO BE AT THE BACK AT THE BRAND NEW MAY STAND WHERE YOUR VIEWS EH IMPAIRED BUT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF TICKETS AVAILABLE FOR NEXT SEASON ARE GOING TO BE LESS THAN THOSE TOP PRICE BUT THERE'S OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WON'T BE PAYING MORE
O.K. AND WHAT BUT AGAIN I MEAN IT'S THEY'RE NOT THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE ARE THEY ARSENAL WEST HAM
MORE EXPENSIVE UP CLOSER TO ONE HUNDRED YEAH COURSE THE EYE YOU CAN'T DENY THAT BUT THAT'S NOT THE ARGUMENT ARGUMENT AS A CLASS FOOTBALL
AND CERTAINLY IN THE PREMIERSHIP TO TAKE HER PLACE OF TWO HIGH ACROSS THE BOARD SPECIALLY WITH THE MONEY THAT'S COMING INTO THE GAME HAS BEEN COMING TO GAME FOR THE LAST PROBABLY TEN YEARS I WAS GOING TO BE COMING TO THE GAME EVEN MORE NEXT SEASON BUT SOME OF THAT THAT MONEY IS EARMARKED FOR GOOD CAUSES ISN'T IT TO BE GIVEN AWAY SOMETHING LIKE A BILLION POUNDS IS GOING TO LOWER LEAGUES AND GRASS ROOTS FOOT WHICH WE DON'T HANG ON TO ALL OF IT ALSO ASSURED YOUR DOES CORRECT BUT OBVIOUSLY FOOTBALL CLUBS IN THE PREMIERSHIP AND MAKE MORE MONEY THAN YOU'VE EVER DONE
I WAS ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS A VERY VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THAT TO MAKE A LOT OF OUR LIVES GOING TO A FOOTBALL GAME A LOT EASIER AND TO STOP PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN GOING TO GAME FOR THIRTY FORTY YEARS BEEN PLACED OUT OF DOING SOMETHING TO DAWN AND GIVE LOVE DOING FOR YEARS SO WHAT SHOULD THE HIGHEST PRICE WHAT IS THE POINT AT WHICH YOU'D BE PREPARED TO COMPROMISE
WE'VE BEEN PREPARED TO COMPROMISE ON THROUGH THE LAST THIRTEEN AT A FOOTBALL CLUB A FOOTBALL CLUB AND I WAS ON BEEN PREPARED TO COMPROMISE THE BASICALLY NOT LISTEN TO A WORD WE SERVE IT DONE WHAT THEY'VE GONE AND THAT'S THEIR CHOICE OBVIOUSLY BOUGHT FOR ME AND FOR THOSE AS AN ORGANISATION WE WENT INTO THESE
WHITLEY PROPOSALS MONITOR WHEN CATEGORISATION ONE WAS TO LOWER THE PRICE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE GUARDS GOT TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR THE MAJORITY TO GET INTO AND THE OTHER ONE WAS TO GET MORE LOCAL YOUNG EWES INTO THE GAME NOW
MORE USERS OF THE GAME WHICH IS HIS HE SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING BUT A BIT OF MONEY GOES INTO THOSE THINGS THAT YOU WANT RATHER THAN INTO THE NEXT LOT OF PLAYERS THEY MIGHT BUY IT IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO IN YOUR VIEW EVEN IF IT AFFECTS THE FORTUNES OF THE CLUB WELL WE'RE NOT HERE TO ER CERTAINLY AN ARGUMENT OF THE FOOTBALL CLUB OVER I'LL FOOTBALLER MATTERS THAT'S FOR THEM TO DECIDE I DID CHOOSE TO SPEND THAT MONEY OR WHERE ASKING FOR OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AS AN ALL POINT ONE TWO FIVE PER CENT OF
ACTUAL INCOME THAT THE CLUB GENERATES IT'S NOT A GREAT DEAL AND WE'VE GOT WHAT I CAN FOR TO MAKE A BETTER THAN EVERYBODY KEITH CALVIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
IT IS FIVE TO NINE NOW TALKING OF SPORT YOU CAN PUT YOUR MONEY ON A WIMBLEDON LADIES' CHAMPION IN PROBABLY TWO THOUSAND THIRTY THREE MAYBE FOUR OF TAKES A BIT OF TIME ANDY MURRAY'S WIFE KIM SERIES JUST GIVEN BIRTH TO A BABY GIRL NO PRESSURE ON HER OF COURSE BUT IF SHE CAN WIN WHEN SHE SEVENTEEN WILL BE DOING THAT NOW THAT MAYBE A BIT OF NEWS THAT THEY WILL BE RAISING A GLASS TO TONIGHT DOWN THE DOG AND DUCK
OR EVEN THE MOON UNDER THE WATER THAT NAME WHICH MAY SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU YOU MAY NOT KNOW WAS FIRST USED BY GEORGE ORWELL WHO WROTE AN ESSAY ON WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS THE PERFECT POP IT IS SEVENTY YEARS SINCE HE DID IT SO WE ASKED DRINKERS TO RECITE HIS WORDS
MY FAVOURITE PUBLIC HOUSE THE MOON UNDER WATER IS ONLY TWO MINUTES FROM A BUS BUT HE'S ON A SIDE STREET AND DRUNKS AND ROWDIES NEVER SEEM TO FIND THEIR WAY THERE EVEN ON SATURDAY NIGHTS ITS CLIENTELE THOUGH FAIRLY LARGE CONSISTS MOSTLY OF REGULARS WHO OCCUPY THE SAME CHAIR EVERY EVENING AND GO THERE FOR CONVERSATION AS MUCH AS FOR THEIR BEER IF YOUR ASS WHY YOU FAVOUR A PARTICULAR PUBLIC HOUSE IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL OR PUT THE BEER FIRST
I THINK THE MOST APPEALS TO ME ABOUT THE MOON UNDER WATER IS WHAT PEOPLE CALL ITS ATMOSPHERE IN ORDER THERE'S GENERALLY A GOOD FIRE BURNING AT LEAST TWO OF THE BARS THERE ARE PUBLIC BUYER A SALOON BAR A LADY'S BUYER AND UPSTAIRS A DINING ROOM THE BARMAID'S NO MOST OF THEIR CUSTOMERS BY NAME
I TAKE A PERSONAL INTEREST IN EVERYONE THEY'RE ALL MIDDLE AGED WOMEN TWO OF THEM HAVE THEIR HAIR DYED IN QUITE SURPRISING SHADES THEY CALL EVERYONE DEAR IRRESPECTIVE OF AGENTS
NOT DUCKING PUBS WHERE THE BARMAID CALL YOU DUCK YOU ALWAYS HAVE A DISAGREEABLE RAFFISH ATMOSPHERE THEY'RE PARTICULAR ABOUT THE DRINKING VESSELS AT THE MOON UNDER WATER AND NEVER FOR EXAMPLE MAKE THE MISTAKE OF SERVING A PINT OF BEER IN HER HAND THERE WAS GRASS APART FROM GLASS AND PEWTER MUGS THEY HAVE SOME OF THOSE PLEASANT STRAWBERRY PINK CHINA ONES WHICH ARE NOW SELDOM SEEN IN LONDON
TRYING TO MONTHS WENT OUT ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE LIKE THEIR DRINK TO BE TRANSPARENT BUT IN MY OPINION BEER TASTE BETTER OUT OF CHINA THE MOON UNDER WATER IS MY IDEAL OF WHAT A PUB SHOULD BE AT ANY RATE
BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO REVEAL SOMETHING WHICH THE DISCERNING AND DISILLUSION READER WILL PROBABLY HAVE GUESSED ALREADY THERE IS NO SUCH PLACE AND IF ANYONE KNOWS OF A PUB THAT'S DRAUGHT STOKED OPEN FIRES CHEAP MEALS MOTHER THE BARMAIDS AND NOR RADIO I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S NAME WAS SUBPOENAS PROSAIC AS THE RED ON THE RAILWAY
I'M JOINED BY JAMES DOWDESWELL A COMEDIAN WHO IN TRIBUTE TO ORWELL PERFORMS A SHOW CALLED THE PERFECT PUB AND IS WRITING A BOOK OF THE SAME NAME HAS THE RECIPE FOR A PERFECT PUB REALLY CHANGED I THINK NICK THE THE CORE VALUES OF THE SAME THE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR LANGUAGE
FOR EXAMPLE THE NOWADAYS THAT WOULD START MY FAVOURITE PUB IT'S IN AND THE HOT SPOT BUT IT'S OFF THE BEATEN TRACK SO BINGE DRINKING IDIOTS CAN'T FIND IT EVEN WITH GOOGLE MAPS IF YOU KNOW WHAT WIFE I TOO THOUGH OH YEAH THE BETTER TIMES YOU SEE WIFE I ADVERTISED BIGGER THAN BEER
BUT THEIR BASIC RAW INGREDIENTS COULD DRAFT AN OPEN FIRE CHEAP MEALS THAT ORWELL TALKED OF THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO JUST TORE BITS OF CITIES LOOKING FOR PUBS JUST LIKE THAN STRUGGLE TO FIND EXACTLY I
I ONCE DID A SHOW UP IN LEEDS AND I WENT TO FIVE PUPS BEFORE I CAN FIND ONE WITH DECENT DRAUGHT BEER WHEN YOU DID YOUR SHOW YOU'VE GOT MEMBERS THE AUDIENCE KNEW TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT WAS A PERFECT PUB COULD THEY AGREE OR IN TRUTH DIS ONE PERSON'S VISION OF WHAT IS PERFECT ACTUALLY HORRIFIED SOMEBODY ELSE OH YEAH THE BIGGEST CONTENTION WAS T. V. IN THE PUB THAT USED TO SPLIT THE CROWD EVERY SINGLE NIGHT SOME PEOPLE COME IN AND THE WATCH SPORT OTHER PEOPLE COME IN FOR A CHAT
AND YOUR RECIPE MY RECIPE IS A BLEND OF ALL THOSE THINGS I LIKE A GOOD FIREPLACE GOOD DRAFT DALE AT SPORT WHEN I WANT IT SO MAYBE THAT'S IN A DIFFERENT BAR I'D QUITE LIKE A BOUNCY CASTLE OUT THE BACK MY FAVOURITE SUGGESTION WILL YOU OH DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU LOOK A LITTLE YELLOW FOR ME FOR ME YEAH I THINK IT'S SUGGESTED SOMEONE SUGGESTED A FIREMAN'S POLE FROM THE TOILETS TO THE BAR
I THINK A GOOD IDEA THAT IS A BRILLIANT SEE I WOULDN'T HAVE SUCH A PLACE EXISTS YOU'VE NOT BEEN TOLD IT DOES I'VE NOT YET NOW WE WANT YOUR TWEET YOUR EMAILS TELL US ABOUT THE THE POLE ON THE BAR AND THEY CAN HEAR THE SHOW WHERE WE SEE YOUR SHOW THE PERFECT PUB I'M DOING IT NEXT AT THE BATH COMEDY FESTIVAL I THINK ON APRIL THE
