# PETER THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMING UP TO EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND OF COURSE IT IS THE FALL OUT FROM BRECHT'S IT STILL ON ALL THE FRONT PAGES NO SURPRISE THE TELEGRAPH PICKS UP IN THE STORY YESTERDAY OF SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS MANY MARRIED COUPLES MIGHT HAVE SOME SYMPATHY WITH WHICH IS AN EMAIL FROM SARAH VINE TO A HUSBAND MICHAEL GAVE WHICH HE ACCIDENTALLY SENT TO A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS THOSE THAT SHE INTENDED TO READ IT
SHE'S BASICALLY WARNING A HUSBAND OUT THE RISKS ARE BACKING BORIS JOHNSON AND TRYING TO GET INTO NAIL BORIS JOHNSON DOWN ON VARIOUS ISSUES BEFORE HE GIVES HIS ENTIRE SUPPORT AND SHE IS YES THAT PAUL DAY COS THE EDITOR OF THE MAIL AND RUPERT MURDOCH THE OWNER OF THE SUN AND THE TIMES QUITE INSTINCTIVELY DISLIKE BORIS BUT WOULD BACK HIM IF MY GAVE WAS INVOLVED IN HIS CAMPAIGN WE'VE STRUGGLED TO FIND THE STORY IN THE DAILY MAIL THIS MORN
THE BIG STORY IN THE DAY ON THE FRONT PAGE ANYWAY IS ABOUT BRECHT'S IT AND IF YOU WANT TO GET A BIT OF ELUCIDATION ON THE SUBJECT OF CLEARING UP A FEW POINTS DON'T READ THE FINANCIAL TIMES AND THE DAILY MAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH OPPOSITE APPROACHES THE MALES IS THAT FRANCE HAS SIGNALLED THAT THE E.U. YOU COULD STRIKE A DEAL WITH BRITAIN ON IMMIGRATION A MAJOR BOOSTED SAYS FOR HOPES OF A SMOOTH EXIT FOR THE U.K.
HOWEVER THE F. T. SAYS EUROPEAN LEADERS ISSUED A STARK RIB US TO BRITISH HOPES OF A FAVOURABLE NEW TRADE DEAL WITH THE E.U. YESTERDAY HARDENING THEIR CONDITIONS FOR ALLOWING ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AFTER THE E. YOU AFTER THE U.K. RATHER LEAVES THE EUROPEAN SO YET AGAIN YOU PAYS YOUR MONEY MAKES HIS CHOICE
# THE EYE AND DAILY MIRROR THEY'RE UNITED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE LABOUR PARTY NOW IT'S CIVIL WAR IT SAYS ACROSS THE DAILY MIRROR DEPT WITH AFTER TOM WATSON SAYING THAT CORBIN MUST QUIT AND WITH THE NEWS THAT WE'RE GOING TO ANGELA EAGLE IS EXPECTED TO GO FOR THE LEADERSHIP TODAY LABOUR'S FIGHT TO THE DEATH IS THE HEADLINE ON THE EYE THE TIMES HAS THE STORY ON ITS FRONT PAGE THE JEREMY CORBIN WANT US TO STAND DOWN BUT HE'S BEEN BLOCKED BY DOING SO
FROM DOING SO BY HARD LEFT ALLIES WERE TRYING TO KEEP CONTROL OF LABOUR THIS IS ACCORDING TO SENIOR PARTY SOURCES HE'S BEING URGED TO REMAIN IN HIS POST COULDN'T TIMES BY JOHN MCDONNELL THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR STRONGEST ALLY ON THE PARTY'S LEFT AND ALSO THEIR PAPERS SUGGEST ANOTHER SENIOR PARTY SAW SAID IT'S ALSO BY SEAMUS MILNE WHOSE HIS COMMUNICATIONS CHIEF FINALLY IF YOU ENJOY A LIE IN THAT'S GOOD IF YOU'RE A WOMAN BUT NOT IF YOU'RE A MAN
# YET ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION OF HOW MEN OTHERS SUFFERING SEX HERE WE GO RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EXTRA SLEEP MAKE CUT WOMEN'S RISK OF DEVELOPING DIABETES HOWEVER THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE FOR THERE WE SUFFER
THE TIME IS TEN PAST NO COMMENT AT ALL DID IT TO THINKING HOW THEY CAN BE USED IN FUTURE
# THE DIRECTOR OF THE C.I.A. JOHN BRENNAN HAS SAID IT WAS ISLAMIC STATE BEHIND THE LATEST TERROR ATTACK IN TURKEY RICHARD GALPIN IS OUR WORLD AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT THAT'LL COME AS NO GREAT SURPRISE I IMAGINE RICHARD
NO NOT AT ALL IT'S SLIPPY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HERE HE'S BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG RIGHT
THE MOMENTS AFTER THIS ATTACK TOOK PLACE THE GOVERNMENT SAID THEY BELIEVED IT WAS SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE WHICH WAS BEHIND IT OF COURSE
IT'S NOT CONFIRMED AND CERTAINLY NO GROUP HAS ADMITTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR CARRYING OUT THE ATTACK BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STYLE OF THE TART THIS MARAUDING STYLE
WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS ALSO WEARING SUICIDE BELTS THEY MOVED TO DIFFERENT AREAS THAT LOOK LIKE IT WAS A COORDINATED
ATTACK SO THAT CERTAINLY IS THE WORKING ASSUMPTION AT THE MOMENT AND WHY ARE THEY ATTACKING TURKEY IN THE WAY THAT THEY ARE
I THINK THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT TURKEY IS SEEN AS BEING A CLOSE ALLY OF WESTERN POWERS OF COURSE IT'S PART OF THE WEST'S MILITARY ALLIANCE NATO IT'S ALSO JOINED THE U.S. LEADS
COALITION ATTACKING ISLAMIC STATE IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT AREAS AND THE INCH NICK BASE IN TURKEY IS BEING USED BY U.S. WAR PLANES TO COME
AIR STRIKES ON TARGET SO I THINK FOR ALL THOSE REASONS IT'S ALSO IN SOME RESPECTS AN EASY TARGET OF COURSE THERE'S THE LONG BORDER
ANNE'S TURKEY PEOPLE CAN GET ACROSS QUITE EASILY
THEREFORE ABLE TO MOVE INTO THIS AREA AND THERE ARE REPORTS YOU DON'T KNOW OF COURSE AT THIS STAGE BUT THERE ARE AND CONFIRM
PROTECTED ISLAMIC STATES DID MOVE INTO TURKEY YOU QUITE RECENTLY
# RICHARD MANY THANKS IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX THE SCIENCE MINISTER JOE JOHNSON WILL BE SPEAKING TO LEADING SCIENTIST TODAY NOT LEAST CONSIDER WHAT BRECK'S IT WILL MEAN FOR THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND RESEARCH TOM FIELD AND IS A SCIENCE EDITOR AND TOM THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY IN A WAY NOT ENTIRELY UNIFIED BUT THEY'RE VERY OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR THE E.U. NOT LEAST BECAUSE THEY ARGUE THAT THE U.K. GETS OUT MORE THAN IT PUT IN
NOT I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WITH AS YOU SAY ONE OR TWO NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS WAS DEVASTATED BY THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM AS NO TWO WAYS ABOUT THAT I SPOKE TO SIR PAUL NURSE YESTERDAY THAT'S THE NOBEL LAUREATE IS GOING TO BE BOSS OF THE NEW FRANCIS CRICK INSTITUTE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY HE DESCRIBED IT AS THE WORST DISASTER FOR U.K. SCIENCE EVER
AND THAT THE REAL UNDERPINNING BEHIND THAT IS
THESE DAYS SCIENCE IS NOT ABOUT ONE BLOKE IN A GARRETT AND THINKING AWAY ABOUT A PROBLEM LIKE EINSTEIN DID AND COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION IT'S A COLLABORATIVE ADVENTURE AND THE U.K. HAS THRIVED AND PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN THIS IT WIDER COLLABORATIVE CO OPERATIVE ATMOSPHERE WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION
IT'S FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IS THEIR PARTICULAR CONCERN HERE I MEAN BASICALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT THE BEST BRAINS TO THE BEST UNIVERSITY SOME OF THE BEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD AND HAVE REALLY BEEN ABLE TO BECOME A SCIENTIFIC POWER HOUSE HERE IN THE U.K. A LEADING LIGHT FOR SCIENCE ENDURE THEY'RE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT MONEY THOUGH AREN'T THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY'RE BASICALLY THE TWO CONCERNS COME DOWN TO WE PAY IN
QUITE A LOT OF MONEY INTO THE SCIENTIFIC KITTY IF YOU LIKE FOR EUROPE BUT WE GET OUT A LOT MORE IN TERMS OF THE GRANTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SO WELL AT SCIENCE AND THE SECOND IS THIS IDEA OF FREE MOVEMENT THOSE ARE THE TWO KEY THINGS THAT IT IS A COLLABORATIVE VENTURA AND PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND AND COME AND SHARE THEIR IDEAS AND DO THEIR GOOD SCIENCE HERE AT
WHAT UNIVERSE DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY IDEAS AS TO HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS IN THE NEW WORLD WHATEVER THE NEW WORLD LOOKS LIKE WELL THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM I MEAN WHEN I SPOKE TO SIR PAUL HE TALKED ABOUT A POLITICAL VACUUM ABOUT NOBODY BEING IN NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE PLAN IS THERE WAS NO PRE PLANNING AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM RESULT AND I THINK
# WE'RE GOING TO HEAR SOME INITIAL THOUGHTS FROM JOE JOHNSON LATER TODAY BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A PLAN AND THE PLAN DEPENDS SO MUCH ON WHAT DEAL WE CAN STRIKE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION OVER THE COMING TWO YEARS IT'S A STORY WE'LL BE RETURNING TO HER NOT THIS TEN TO EIGHT THIS MORNING TOM FIELD AND THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S A QUARTER PAST SIX BEFORE THE REFERENDUM GEORGE OSBORNE WARNED OF MANY DIRE CONSEQUENCES IF WE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ONE OF THEM WAS THAT HOUSE PRICES WOULD PLUNGE DOMINIC
WAS HE RIGHT WELL YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE CHANCE AS WARNING ON HOUSE PRICES HE WARNED OF THIS IMMEDIATE SHOCK THERE WOULD SEEM PRICES DOWN BY EIGHTEEN PERCENT QUITE A SPECIFIC NUMBER THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE MARKET'S SHARE THE SAME HOUSEHOLDERS AND HOSPITALS EXCUSE ME AN ESTATE AGENCY CHAINS HAVE TAKEN A HAMMERING SINCE ABOUT
NOT EVERYONE SHARES THAT VIEW WITH ME IS PROFESSOR DAVID MILES OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE A FORMER MEMBER OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE DAVID DO YOU SHARE THE CHANCELLOR'S GLOOMY VIEW OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO HOUSE PRICES
I DON'T THINK I DO I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT IN THE U.K. ECONOMY RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE U.K. HOUSING MARKET WOULDN'T BE WOULDN'T BE TOP OF MY LIST I THINK IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION FROM THE FINANCIAL CRASH OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHERE THE BANKS WERE IN REAL PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY AND THE SUPPLY OF LENDING MORTGAGES PRETTY MUCH DRIED UP MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES WENT UP TO HIM FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE
RIGHT NOW I THINK THE BANKS ARE IN A MUCH MORE ROBUST SITUATION THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S PREPARED TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING I DON'T THINK THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME AT ALL IS THAT MORTGAGE RATES GO UP
I SUSPECTED THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO ARE NERVOUS ABOUT BUYING HOUSES RIGHT MAYBE PEOPLE WHO WERE ABOUT TO BUY WILL PULL OUT I SUSPECT THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN THE MARKET MAY DIP DOWN FOR A WHILE BUT A BIG FALL IN HOUSE PRICES WELL WHO KNOWS BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME THERE ARE SOME PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS WHO ARE BETTING ON A HOUSE PRICE FALL THEY SEEM TO BE THINKING THAT WAY IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR SHARE PRICE OF POO HAVE SUMMONED ONE OF THE BIG HOUSE BUILDERS IN MARCH TWENTY TWO POUNDS IT WILL OPEN TODAY AT FOURTEEN POUNDS THAT'S THAT'S A THIRD OF ITS PHILBY
THAT INDICATES THAT THERE'S A BIT OF NERVOUSNESS AROUND THE HOUSING MARKET ABSOLUTELY NERVOUSNESS AROUND IN THAT MARKET AND MORE GENERALLY IN THE ECONOMY RIGHT MAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE
BUT I THINK THE THE DRIVERS HAVE BIG FALLS IN HOUSE PRICES HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SHARP INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES AND A COLLAPSE IN CONFIDENCE NEGATIVE EQUITY DRIVING SOME PEOPLE INTO A POSITION WHERE THEY MAY NEED TO SELL I DON'T THINK THOSE THINGS ARE ON THE HORIZON RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU TOUCHED ON INTEREST RATES IF YOU WERE SITTING ON THE M. P. C. WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING THAT THERE IS A LOT OF NOTES UP FROM CITY ECONOMISTS SUGGESTING ZERO
INTEREST RATE HAD BY THE END OF THE YEAR FOR BRITAIN
WELL I THINK IT IT'LL DEPEND VERY MUCH ON HOW THINGS SEEM TO BE PLAYING OUT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS IF I WAS ON THE COMMITTEE I WOULDN'T BE IN A GREAT HURRY TO DO SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY I THINK THERE'S BEEN ACTUALLY A PRETTY ORDERLY FINANCIAL MARKET RESPONSE TO THIS THIS PRETTY UNEXPECTED
THE EVENT MOVEMENTS IN STOCK PRICES AND THE EXCHANGE RATE HAVE BEEN I MEAN SIGNIFICANT BUT BUT NOT DRAMATIC SO I I DON'T THINK IF I WAS STILL ON THE COMMITTEE I'D BE RUSHING TO PULL LEVERS AND YOURSELF RIGHT NOW I THINK IT WILL BE TIME TO SIT
AND WAIT AND SEE HOW THINGS SEEM TO BE PANNING OUT IN TERMS OF SPENDING AND G.D.P. UNEMPLOYMENT YOUR ADVICE IS TO KEEP IT PIECES KEEP YOUR POWDER DRY IF IT WAS ME RIGHT NO I WOULD BE WANTING TO TAKE HER SORT A GOOD HARD LOOK AT WHAT THE HARD EVIDENCE IS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY AND NOT FEEL THE NEED TO RUSH INTO ANYTHING AND THEY WERE THE BIG QUESTION WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONFLICTING VIEWS ON THIS
HAS THE BRICKS AT VOTE BEEN A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING FOR THE BRITISH ECONOMY I THINK THE LONG I MEAN I THINK IN THEN IN THE NEAR TERM CLEARLY WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS UNCERTAINTY NOW THAT THAT'S PROBABLY BAD FOR ME YOU TURN ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE IS WHAT IS THE LONG RUN ECONOMIC IMPACT OF BEING
OUTSIDE AND THERE I JUST MAKE ONE POINT WHICH IS THAT THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY AND HERE'S WHY I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS DONE FOR EXAMPLE BY THE TREASURY IN THE LONG RUN COS OF BEING OUTSIDE THEY HINGE CRUCIALLY ON WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE LEVEL OF LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY IN THE U.K. HOW PRODUCTIVE WITH YOUR AVERAGE WORKER IN THE U.K. BE AND THAT'S AN ISSUE ON WHICH WE KNOW SO VERY LITTLE
AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND UP TO TODAY THE LEVEL OF LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY IN THE U.K. HAVE PROBABLY FALLEN BY SOMETHING OF THE ORDER OF FIFTEEN PERCENT RELATIVE TO WHERE PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT HAPPENED SO ON THE CRUCIAL ISSUE OF THE LONG ONE COSTS WHICH IS ALL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO LOW PRODUCTIVITY
ECONOMIST FRANKLY ARE LARGELY IN THE DOG SO THERE ARE BIGGER BIGGER ISSUES WERE EVEN THAN THE BRICKS IT VOTE THANK YOU PROFESSOR DAVID MILES OR TURN TO THE WIDER MARKETS NOW AND IF YOU THINK IF YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AFTER THE BRICKS AT VOTE I SUGGEST YOU TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AFTER A BIG RISE YESTERDAY IT WAS UP THREE AND A HALF PER CENT IN A SINGLE DAY THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED HAS NOW RECOVERED ALL THE GROUND LOST AFTER THE REFERENDUM
AND IF THAT'S NOT CONFUSING ENOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING SIGNALS ABOUT HOW STRONG CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REALLY IS THE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND DICK'S WHICH IS RUN BY YOU GO FROM THE CENTRE FOR ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS RESEARCH WAS FALLING BEFORE THE VOTE AND IT HAS CONTINUED TO FALL IT'S NOW AT ITS LOWEST FOR THREE YEARS HE AND SCOTT CAUGHT SCOTS COOK EXCUSE ME SCOTT CORFE DIRECTOR AT THE CINDER FOR ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT CONSUMERS
SHOCKED BY THE REFERENDUM RESULT THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND THERE'S UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOMES HOUSE PRICES JOB SECURITY WHICH WE THINK IS GOING TO WEIGH ON CONSUMER SPENDING AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE CHANCE FOR A RECESSION OVER THE COMING PERIODS AND SERIOUS CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT BUT WE THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS POSSIBLY A BRIEF RECESSION RATHER THAN AN ALL OUT CRISIS BUT YESTERDAY ON THIS PROGRAMME WE HEARD FROM DIXONS CARPHONE BOSS JAMES AND HE SAID EVERYTHING WAS JUST
SINCE IN THE LAST FIVE DAYS OF HIS PRETTY EARLY DAYS WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN TRADE PRETTY MUCH CONTINUE AS BEFORE WITH SAILS UP I THINK THE MOST CUSTOMERS ARE CARRYING ON WITH THEIR LIVES I THINK WE GET VERY TIED UP IN IN A IN A IN A WORLD'S HAD BY THINKING THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY ARE BUT I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY THAT THEY'RE JUST CARRYING ON DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING BEFORE SO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON I'M JOINED BY CAN ONLY FANATIC EQUITIES ANALYST THAT YOU B'S CAN WE WERE TO GET ON FRIDAY AT THE U.B.S. TRAINING FOR ME WATCHING THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED TUMBLE
NONE OF IT EVER HAPPENED WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER IS THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED IS NOT REALLY EXPOSED TO THE U.K. ECONOMY AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE U.K. SO THREE QUARTERS OF ITS SALES ACTUALLY LEAVE THE U.K. AND ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF ITS SALES LEAVE EUROPE SO YOU HAVE A CURRENCY FOLLOWING VERY RAPIDLY THAT'S THE FIRST ORDER OF EVENTS THE CURRENCY MOVES VERY QUICKLY BUT IT TAKES TIME AND THAT BENEFITS ARE AN AINS BECAUSE YOUR OWN OUTSIDE THE U.K. AND BRING YOUR MONEY BACK ON
WITH A WEAKER STERLING SO I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE BIG INTERNATIONAL DEFENCE LIVES WITHIN THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED EVEN A VODAFONE OFFER SOME PROTECTION SO THEY LIKE THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MID CAPS THE FOOTY TO FIFTY
AND YOU LOOK AT ASSET CLASSES AROUND THE GLOBE INCLUDING YOU S. BAHN SWITZERLAND THE WORST PERFORMING ASSET CLASS SINCE THE DAY THAT THE RESULT CAME UP WAS THE FOOTSIE TO FIFTY JUST GO BACK OVER THAT AGAIN THE FOOTY TO FIFTY IS AN IMPORTANT INDEX ISN'T IT COS IT'S REGARDED AS A BIT OF BENCHMARK OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE U.K. ECONOMY AND YOU JUST SAID IT'S BEEN THE WORST PERFORMER
SINCE THURSDAY SINCE THE VOTE YES OF EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD I'VE JUST YES WE'VE GOT A CHART NOT EVERY EVERY EVERYTHING BUT WE LOOK AT ABOUT FORTY ASSET CLASSES AROUND THE WORLD THAT PEOPLE FOCUS ON WHETHER IT BE GOLD U.S. EQUITIES U.S. BONDS SPANISH BONDS EQUITIES EXCEPT ARRGH SO PEOPLE WAKING UP THIS MORNING TO READ THAT THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED HAS RECOVERED
THEY SHOULDN'T JUST THINK IT'S ALL FINE BECAUSE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE FOOTY TO FIFTY WHICH IS A BIT A GAUGE OF U.K. ECONOMY AND IT'S STILL NOT GREAT ABSOLUTELY JUST TODAY WERE CUT IN A U.K. ARE ECONOMISTS ARE CUTTING A U.K. G.D.P. GROWTH BY ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT THIS YEAR AND FIFTY TO SEVENTY PERCENT NEXT YEAR SO THAT'S A BIG CUT TO DOMESTIC GROWTH SO IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO DOMESTIC CROW IF YOU WILL START TO FEEL IT HOUSEHOLD CASH FLOWS I'M GOING TO START TO FEEL IT BECAUSE COSTS ARE GOING TO GO UP
AND YOUR WAGES AREN'T GOING TO GO UP TO MATCH THAT IT'S ALSO A VERY PATCHY MARKET ISN'T IT THERE ARE SOME SHEARS AS YOU INDICATED THERE DOING ABSOLUTELY FINE ANOTHER NOT WHICH AREAS ARE YOU LOOKING AT TO DO WELL ON WHICH TO DO POORLY
I THINK THIS ONE THING THAT WE DO LOOK AS ACQUIT EQUITY INVESTORS WE LOOK AT SOMETHING CALLED A QUALITY STARK AND THEN ARE JUST CHEAP VALUE STARK IN QUALITIES HIGHER RETURNS AND CAPITAL AND PROFITABILITY THEY'RE DOING VERY WELL THAT WAS A SECOND US PERFORMING ASSET CLASS SINCE THE VOTE CAME OUT QUALITY AS A STYLE THAT LARGE CAT DEFENCES ARE SWITZERLAND PERHAPS BECAUSE IT'S A NON EUROPE Y. YOU TRADE OR NON E. YOU TRADE THOSE SORTS OF ASSET CLASSES BEYOND THE DOMESTIC STUFF THE RETAILERS YOU MENTIONED AT THE HOUSE BUILDERS
# LOOK OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH KAREN ALL THE VIEW B'S NOW GRAPHENE HAS BEEN A SCIENTIFIC SENSATION TO FORM OF CARBON THE SAME STUFF THAT YOU'RE FINDING IN COLWYN DIAMONDS BUT OF COURSE IT HAS THESE NEAR MIRACULOUS PROPERTIES ONE HUNDRED TIMES STRONGER THAN STEEL CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND OF COURSE IT'S TRANSPARENT
IT WAS ALSO FOR A WHILE ANYWAY A STOCKMARKET SENSATION BUT YESTERDAY ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT HAD PROMISED TO CASH IN ON THE BOOM GRAPHENE MANNEQUIN HEAD IT'S SHEER SUSPENDED FROM TRADING NEVER A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT
GRAPHENE MANIC HIM SAID IT WASN'T IN A POSITION TO FILE ITS ACCOUNTS ON TIME IT TOLD THE B. B. C. WHO WAS WORKING TO PUBLISH THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE NOW TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF GRAPHENE AND ITS COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION WITH US IN OUR SALFORD STUDIOS HAS JAMES BAKER GRAPHENE DIRECTOR FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER WHERE OF COURSE THE MATERIAL WAS FIRST PROPERLY ISOLATED JAMES COULD YOU TELL US AGAIN JUST JUST WHAT IS GRIFFIN AND WHY IS THAT SO FANTASTIC
SO SO GRAPHENE WAS FIRST ISOLATED IN UNIVERSITY MANCHESTER IN TWO THOUSAND FOR TWO SCIENTISTS TAKEN STICKY TAPE AND GRAPHITE PEELED A SINGLE ATOMIC LAYER OF CARBON SO GRAPHENE IS A SINGLE ATOMIC LAYER OF CARBON
OR WHY A COMPANY STRUGGLING WITH IT WE HAD THIS NEWS FROM GRAPHENE MANIC HIM YESTERDAY IS IT ALL A BIT TOO EARLY TO PUT TO PREDICT HUGE RICHES FROM US SO FROM TWO THOUSAND FOR TODAY GRAPHENE FROM ONE PERSPECTIVE IS HIS TWELVE YEARS YOUNG OR TWELVE YEARS OLD SO AS A NEW MATERIAL IT'S STILL QUITE EARLY IN ITS LIFE CYCLE COMPARED TO FOR EXAMPLE SILICONE ALL CARBON FIBRE SO TWELVE YEARS HE'S STILL QUITE YOUNG AND INITIALLY PEOPLE INVESTED IN HOW YOU ACTUALLY PRODUCE THIS WONDER MATERIAL GRAPHENE SO MANY DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR PRODUCING GRAPHENE MATERIAL HOWEVER WHAT YOU'RE SEEING VERY RAPIDLY NOW PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS IT'S A REAL ADVANCE IN PEOPLE NOW LOOKING AT APPLICATIONS USING THE GRAPHENE AND TODAY YOU CAN BUY EVERYTHING FROM TENNIS RACQUETS FRUIT TO FISHING RODS FRUIT TO CYCLE TYRES WERE PEOPLE ARE ADDING A SMALL AMOUNT OF GRAPHENE TO AN EXISTING COMPONENT AS A COAT IN OR AS A COMPOSITE
TO MAKE THAT PRODUCT STRONGER OR LIGHTER OR MORE CONDUCTIVE I'LL BE ANY GOOD AT BRITAIN IN EXPLOITING THIS THERE'S THAT THERE'S A COMMON THEME ISN'T THERE OF BRITAIN GOES BACK TO THE JET ENGINE AND FRANK WHITTLE OF BRITAIN DISCOVERING SOMETHING AND THEN LOSING OUT ON ON ON THE RICHES THAT FOLLOW
SO MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT PROGRESS IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF PATENTS AND CERTAINLY IF YOU MEASURE IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF PATENTS AND U.K. HAS SEVERAL HUNDRED PATTERNS COMPARED TO FOR EXAMPLE CHINA WHO HAS MANY THOUSANDS IF YOU LOOK AT APPLICATIONS I WOULDN'T HERE IN MANCHESTER THE NATIONAL GRAPHENE INSTITUTE AND WE ALSO HAVE A GRAPHENE ENGINEERING INNOVATION CENTRE ON THE WAY WE HAVE OVER FIFTY INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS BIG COMPANIES SMALL COMPANIES LOTS OF S. NIS WORKING TOGETHER TO LOOK AT THE VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OF GRAPHENE
IF YOU LOOK AT ACTIVITY IN TERMS OF APPLICATIONS YOU SEEING QUITE A LOT OF LEAD PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF U.K. COMPANIES BOTH BIG COMPANIES AND ALSO SMALL COMPANIES AND I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY IN A LEADING POSITION IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATIONS WHERE THE VALUE IS CREATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH JAMES BAKER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER

# A REVIEW INTO A SPECIALIST CHILDREN'S CARDIAC UNIT SERVING THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND SOUTH WALES HAS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF SHORTCOMINGS INCLUDING UNDERSTAFFING AND A LACK OF APPROPRIATE NURSING SKILLS THEIR REPORTS HAD PATIENTS AT BRISTOL ROYAL HOSPITAL FOR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN PUT AT RISK OF HARM BUT OUTCOMES OF TREATMENT BUT NO WORSE THAN AT OTHER SUCH CENTRES
# THE COMMONS TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE SAYS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ABANDON PLANS TO CONVERT MORE MOTORWAY HARD SHOULDERS SIN TO NORMAL LANES MINISTERS WANT TO OPEN UP SOME HARD SHOULDERS TO TRAFFIC AS A RELATIVELY CHEAP WAY OF EASING CONGESTION THEN SAYS SAFETY WON'T BE AFFECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE SAID THE SCHEME WOULD POST SIGNIFICANT RISKS
# A RECORD NUMBER OF NEW MEMBERS HAVE BEEN INVITED TO VOTE FOR NEXT YEAR'S OSCARS AFTER AN OUTCRY IN THE PAST TWO YEARS BECAUSE ALL THE NOMINEES IN ACTING CATEGORIES WERE WHITE
THEY'LL BE ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED NEW ACADEMY MEMBERS ALMOST HALF OF THEM WOMEN AND FORTY PER CENT FROM ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND WE'LL KNOW BY NOON HE'LL BE THE NEXT LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND THEREFORE PRIME MINISTERS OR AT LEAST WE'LL KNOW WHO WON'T BE NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NOMINATIONS CLOSED AT NOON
# THEY DO AND WE GET THE TWO BIG BEASTS ENTERING THE FRAYED TODAY JUST HOURS AFTER EACH OTHER THERESA MAY AND BORIS JOHNSON TERESA MADE TODAY'S SETTING OUT HER PITCH IN A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE AND IF I COULD BOIL IT DOWN IT SEEMS TO ME SHE'S PRESENTING HERSELF AS THE MISSUS MERKEL CANDID SERIOUS MINDED HARDWORKING COMPETENT
CREDIBLE WILLING TO DO THE HARD YARDS IN GOVERNMENT POINTING TO HER PERSISTENCE IN GETTING RID OF ABU QATADA HER READINESS TO TAKE ON VESTED INTERESTS LIKE THE POLICE OVER STEPHEN LAWRENCE HILLSBOROUGH STOP AND SEARCH HER COURAGE STANDING UP TO THE AMERICANS OVER THE EXTRADITION OF GARY MCKINNON SHE ALSO
SAYS SHE IS THE UNITY CANDIDATE YOU CAN BRING TOGETHER THE BRICKS AT HERS AND THERE REMAIN AS SHE SAYS SHE WOULD SET UP A NEW POST OF A IT CABINET MINISTER TO OVERSEE THE PROCESS OF WITHDRAWAL AND SHE PRESENTS HERSELF AS A ONE NATION CONSERVATIVE TO BE FAIR PRETTY MUCH ALL THE CANDIDATES SEEM TO BE PITCHING THEMSELVES AS TERMINATION CONCERT BUT OF COURSE MISSUS MERKEL'S OF THEE
LEADER WHO GAVE HER FREE ENTRY PAST TO AS MANY MIGRANTS AS WANTED TO COME SHE WILL ASSIST YOU WON'T WANT TO DO THAT NOW AND I SUPPOSE HER ACHILLES HEEL WILL BE THE FACT THAT SHE HAS FAILED TO GET NET MIGRATION DOWN BUT IT'S A SORT OF IT'S A STYLISTIC SIMILARITY BECAUSE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN BORIS JOHNSON AND THERESA MAY I MEAN THEY ARE POLAR OPPOSITES IN ABSOLUTELY EVERY WAY PERSONALLY MISSUS MAY QUOTE MUCH QUIETER
SHY BORIS JOHNSON OUTGOING FLAMBOYANT POLITICALLY MISSUS MAY A SMALL SEE SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE BORIS JOHNSON METROPOLITAN SOCIAL LIBERAL I MEAN EVEN THE SARTORIAL STYLE AS ENTIRELY YOU KNOW BORIS JOHNSON CRUMPLED CRUMPLED BICYCLE HELMET AND HER KIDS' MEALS AT ALL ACCURATELY TURNED THAT INDEED AND THERE'S ONE SORT OF DAGGER BLOW IN HER ARTICLE WHICH SHE SAYS THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT A GAME
IT'S A SERIOUS BUSINESS THAT HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE'S LIVES AND YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL BORIS JOHNSON WINCE AT THAT HAD A VERY QUICK THOUGHT ABOUT THE LABOUR PARTY STILL TEARING ITSELF APART FIGHT FOR CONTROL GOING ON REALLY
IT'S A FIGHT NOT JUST OVER THE LEADERSHIP BUT OF THE SORT HER FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE PARTY WITH ANGELA EAGLE EXPECTED TO THROW HER HAT INTO THE RING LATER TODAY
REAL QUESTION MARK OVER WHETHER SHE CAN WIN BECAUSE AGAINST HER SHE SEEMS TO HAVE THE MASSED RANKS OF THE UNIONS ARE LARGE NUMBERS OF ORDINARY PARTY MEMBERS INCLUDING IT SEEMS IN HER OWN CONSTITUENCY IN THE FACT THAT IN THE DEPUTY LEADERSHIP CONTEST I THINK SHE CAME IN FOURTH IN HER FAVOUR THOUGH SHE IS NOT PART OF THE LONDON METROPOLITAN POLITICALLY SHE'S A LIVERPUDLIAN SHE'S A WOMAN SHE'S A GOOD PERFORMER
IN THE COMMONS AND YOU KNOW THERE IS A REAL DESIRE AMONGST LABOUR M.P.S FRANKLY TO HAVE ANYONE BUT JEREMY CORBIN BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THE PARTY'S ON THE CUSP OF A TUSSLE BUT NOT SEEN SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES PROBABLY WORSE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BECAUSE THE BENEFITS NEVER HAD A GRASP OF THE PARTY THE UNIONS WERE STILL A SORT OF
BALANCING MODERATING FORCE AND NICK AND BEN I DID NOT HAVE CONTROL OF THE PARTY MACHINE ALL THAT IS NOW COMPLETELY CHANGED SO IT IS GOING TO BE REALLY VERY VERY BRUTAL CONTEST I SUSPECT THANKS
# IT'S NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN CHILDREN RECEIVING CARDIAC TREATMENT AT BRISTOL CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL WERE REPEATEDLY GIVEN POOR CARE AND THEIR PARENTS WERE LET DOWN SO SAYS AN INDEPENDENT REPORT HUGH PYM IS THE B.B.C.'S HEALTH EDITOR AND HUGH THIS WAS A REPORT CHAIRED BY THE Q.C. ELEANOR GRAY WHO FOUND WHAT
WELL I THINK IMPORTANTLY SARAH SHE FOUND THAT THERE WERE SHORTCOMINGS IN CARE THIS COVER THE PERIOD TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH WEREN'T ON THE SCALE OF WHAT WAS DISCOVERED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE WHAT A PUBLIC ENQUIRY THEN DISCOVERED MAJOR SHORT COVERING COMINGS IN CHILDREN'S CARDIAC SERVICES IN BRISTOL
THIS LATEST REVIEW LOOKING AGAIN AT PROBLEMS WHICH HAD BEEN REPORTED BY PARENTS DID FIND THOUGH THAT CARE WAS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD HAVE
I'VE BEEN IN THAT PARENTS WERE LET DOWN IT FOUND THERE WAS UNDERSTAFFING INVOLVING NOT ENOUGH NURSES NOT ENOUGH SKILLS ACROSS THE THE WHOLE FIELD
AND THAT THERE WAS A RISK OF HARM TO PATIENTS THEY TALK OF SERIOUS FAILINGS CRUCIALLY THOUGH THEY DO ALSO CONCLUDE THAT THE OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF THEIR TREATMENT AT THE CARDIAC SERVICES THAT WERE LOOKED AT WERE BROADLY IN LINE WITH OTHER SPECIALIST AREAS WHICH IS WHY I SUPPOSE SHE'S CALLING FOR A REVIEW INTO ALL PAEDIATRIC CENTRE
YES WHAT SHE RECOMMENDED THAT THERE WAS A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TRUST INVOLVED UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS BRISTOL FOUNDATION TRUST BUT THE REVIEW ALSO SAID THAT THERE WAS A CASE FOR LOOKING AT ALL PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE SERVICES BECAUSE WHAT WAS DISCOVERED
IN THE REVIEW WAS THAT THERE WERE HEAVY STRAINS PLACED ON FAMILIES BY THE LIMITATIONS ON CAPACITY THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH BEDS OR SPECIALIST EQUIPMENT AND THE DERMOT GREY Q.C. FEELS THAT THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM AT OTHER HOSPITALS AS WELL AND QUOTES REQUIRES PROPER ATTENTION SO SHE'S RECOMMENDED A NATIONAL REVIEW
AND H. S. ENGLAND SAYS IT WILL CARRY OUT SUCH A REVIEW ANOTHER INTERESTING CONCLUSION OF THE REPORT WAS THAT PARENTS TALKING TO CLINICIANS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED IF THEY WISH TO TO USE THEIR MOBILE PHONES TO RECORD CONVERSATIONS AS LONG AS THE CLINICIAN IS HAPPY WITH THAT THE DOCTOR'S HAPPY BECAUSE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HERE WAS A BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN
PARENTS BETWEEN MEDICAL STAFF AND THAT ALSO I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT NATIONAL OUTCOME OF THIS REVIEW I HAVE TO SAY THE TRUST HAS SAID THAT IT'S WELCOME THE REPORTED ACCEPT THE FINDINGS IT SAYS IT'S EXTREMELY SORRY FOR THE SHORTCOMINGS AND CARE ALTHOUGH IT DOES NO THE REPORT SAYS THERE HAVE BEEN IMPROVEMENTS SINCE THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY

LEADERS THAT BRITAIN WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE IF IT WANTS ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET BUT THE MALE TAKES HEART FROM THE SUGGESTION BY THE FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER MICHELE SAP THAT THERE WOULD BE NO RED LINES IN NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE SINGLE MARKET THE PAPER'S HEADLINE EUROPE STARTS TO CRACK ON MIGRANTS
# THE SPORTS PAGES WIDELY REPORT GARETH SOUTHGATE'S APPARENT DECISION TO RULED HIMSELF OUT OF THE JOB OF ENGLAND MANAGER ROY HOBBS AND OF COURSE RESIGN FROM THE POST ON MONDAY AFTER THE TEAM'S HUMILIATING DEFEAT BY ICELAND AT EURO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE EXPRESS SAYS SOUTHGATE COACH OF THE ENGLAND UNDER TWENTY ONES AT THE FORMER ENGLAND DEFENDER WOULD HAVE TO BE PERSUADED EVEN TO CONSIDER TAKING IT ON A SHORT TERM BASIS THE GUARDIAN SCRIBES DECISION AS A SIGNIFICANT SETBACK FOR THE F.A.

# DISCARDED CHIPS AND PORK RIBS PORK RIBS BUT NO IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND ART MAY NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY HAS DECLARED THAT SHE'LL BE A CANDIDATE IN THE CONTEST TO SIXTY DAVID CAMERON SAYING SHE WANTS A NEW AND RADICAL PROGRAMME OF SOCIAL REFORM
BORIS JOHNSON WILL LAUNCH HIS LEADERSHIP BID LATER THIS MORNING NOT UNCONNECTED WITH ALL THAT ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY DAY AT WESTMINSTER YESTERDAY JEREMY CORBIN FACED MORE CALLS TO STAND DOWN AFTER YET MORE RESIGNATIONS FROM HIS SHADOW CABINET AND SENIOR CONSERVATIVES BEGAN THEIR CAMPAIGNS TO REPLACE DAVID CAMERON A DOWNING STREET AND AS IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH THERE WAS THE FIRST SESSION OF PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTION SINCE THE COUNTRY VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN REPORTS
IN ALICE IN WONDERLAND THERE'S A LEARNED DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW MANY IMPOSSIBLE THINGS A PERSON CAN BELIEVE BEFORE BREAKFAST NOW POST BRECK'S IT WESTMINSTER IS HAVING TO CONSIDER ALL SORTS OF THINGS MANY M.P.S ONCE THOUGHT WERE IMPROBABLE
TO ITS CRITICS PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS OFTEN RESEMBLES A PARLIAMENTARY VERSION OF THE MAD HATTER'S TEA PARTY THINGS WERE MUCH CALMER YESTERDAY EVEN THOUGH ONCE AGAIN IT WAS STANDING ROOM ONLY IN THE COMMONS CHAMBER JEREMY GO ON THEN THANK YOU
ALL THOSE NOISES OFF CAME FROM CONSERVATIVES THE LABOUR BENCHES STARTED QUIET AND THEN TURN DOWN THE VOLUME IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THE LABOUR LEADER ASKED ABOUT THE REFERENDUM ON THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION JEREMY CORBIN SAID LAST WEEK'S VOTE IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE E.U. WAS A REJECTION OF THE STATUS QUO THE PRIME MINISTER HAS TWO MONTHS LEFT WILLIE LEAVE A ONE NATION LEGACY
LEGACY AND WILL THAT ONE NATION LEGACY BAY THE SCRAPPING OF THE BEDROOM
THE BANNING OF ZERO HOURS CONTRACTS AND CANCELLING OF THE CUTS TO UNIVERSAL CREDIT
DAVID CAMERON DOESN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST BUT HE WAS HAPPY TO INTRUDE ON LABOUR'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS BUT HE TALKS ABOUT JOB INSECURITY AND MY TWO MONTHS TO GO IT MIGHT BE HER MY PARTY'S INTEREST FOR HIM TO SIT THERE IT'S NOT IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST AND I WOULD SAY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MAN
ONCE AGAIN THE CHEERS CAME FROM CONSERVATIVES THE LABOUR BENCHES WERE SILENT AS MANY M.P.S SIMPLY STARED AT THEIR OPPONENTS THE S.N.P. LEADER AT WESTMINSTER ANGUS ROBERTSON WANTED TO KNOW WHAT DAVID CAMERON WAS DOING TO PROTECT SCOTLAND PLACE IN EUROPE A STRONG MAJORITY VOTED FOR SCOTLAND TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN
MINISTER AND NICOLA STURGEON IS IN BRUSSELS TODAY SHE'S MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
THERE WERE JEERS FROM THE S.N.P. WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL FOR THE U.K. WOULD ALSO BE THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL FOR SCOTLAND THERE WERE MORE JEERS WHEN UKIP'S ONLY M.P. DOUGLAS CARS WELL GOT TO HIS FEET
I THANKED THE PRIME MINISTER FORGIVING US LAST WEEK GREAT EXERCISE IN DEMOCRACY
THE BOOZE AND HECKLES WERE SO LOUD THE SPEAKER HAD TO STEP IN TO MAKE SURE MY CAR'S WELL COULD FINISH HIS POINT WE ONLY LEAVES SIDE SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT ALTHOUGH WE WON IT WAS A NARROW MANDATE FOR PLENTY OF DECENT PATRIOTIC PEOPLE VOTING FOR HER
DOES THE PRIME MINISTER AGREE WITH ME THAT BOTH SIDES NOW NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE A NEW POST E. YOU NATIONAL CONSENSUS
WHEREBY WE HAVE CLOSE LINKS WITH OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES IN EUROPE AND BEYOND
DAVID CAMERON AGREED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR PEOPLE AND THE COUNTRY TO COME TOGETHER BUT LATER DURING HER MOTHER DEBATE HE REFLECTED THAT IT WAS A TOPSY TURVY WORLD I'VE NEVER FELT GREATER SUPPORT FROM MY PARTY AND I'M LEAVING I'VE NEVER SEEN AN OPPOSITION LEADER WITH THEIR SUPPORT HE'S STAYING IT'S A VERY
AS SOMEONE ABOUT TO ENTER THE POLITICAL GRAVEYARD PERHAPS I COULD MISQUOTE MY FAVOURITE BAND AND SAY LET'S MEET AT THE CEMETERY GATES
A VERSION OF A LINE FROM A SONG BY THE SMITHS BUT THE PRIME MINISTER ISN'T THE ONLY POLITICIAN WHO'S A FAN HERE'S THE LABOUR M.P. KERRY MCCARTHY
IF THE PRIME MINISTER IS GOING TO GET OUT HIS COPY OF THE QUEEN IS DEAD ALBUM HE MIGHT WANT TO DEPRESS MYSELF EVEN FURTHER BY LISTENING TO MY FAVOURITE TRACK I KNOW IT'S OVER ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE LABOUR PARTY'S CONCERNED IT'S AND THERE IS A LIGHT AND IT NEVER GOES
THERE WAS A BIT MORE OF THIS AS DAVID CAMERON RECITED MORE LYRICS FROM THE ALBUM AND YET NO ONE THOUGHT TO QUOTE ANOTHER CLASSIC LINE BY THE SMITHS I WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB AND THEN I FOUND A JOB AND HEAVEN KNOWS I'M MISERABLE NOW
ONLY TWO M.P.S HAVE PERFORMED ON TOP OF THE POPS ONE OF THEM THE S. N. PEAS PETE WISH ASK HAD BEEN STUDYING THE PARLIAMENTARY RULE BOOK ERSKINE MAY RATHER THAN ALBUM NOTES AND SUGGESTED HIS PARTY SHOULD REPLACE LABOUR AS THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION
THE CURRENT OFFICIAL OPPOSITION HAS LOST TWO THIRDS OF THE SHADOW CABINET
LET'S MEET UP IN WHAT REMAINS OF THE FRONT BENCH MOVE LONGER COMMANDS THE SUPPORT OF THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THIS BACKBENCH
IF ANY LABOUR M.P. HAD BEEN WORRYING ABOUT THE SEATING ARRANGEMENTS THE COMMONS SPEAKER JOHN BERCOW WAS ABLE TO PUT THEIR MINDS AT REST I CAN CONFER
THE LABOUR PARTY APPARENTLY CONSTITUTES THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION
SO JUST ANOTHER IMPOSSIBLE THING BUT INTERESTINGLY MY BURKA SAID HE'D THOUGHT ABOUT THE MATTER BEFORE DELIVERING HIS RULING AND HAD TAKEN EXPERT ADVICE
SEAN CURRAN REPORTING THERE ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT MORE JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND DIGITAL RADIO IT IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN
# ON FRIDAY MORNING TOMORROW TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO DESCEND ON TEAT FAR MEMORIAL IN FRANCE TO COMMEMORATE THE ONE HUNDRED YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME IT WAS THE SINGLE BLOODIEST DAY FOR BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE GREAT WAR JIM NOTTIE IS HE ASKED TO SECURE STRAW ON THE LEADING WORLD WAR ONE HISTORIAN WHY THIS DAY IS DEEMED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN OUR HISTORY
WHEN WE WERE PLANNING THE CENTENARY WHEN ALL THE INITIAL DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING ON BEFORE TWENTY FOURTEEN IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLEAR THAT THE FIRST TO JULY TWENTY SIXTEEN WOULD BE THE ONE WAY POINT BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTY
AND WHY IS THAT THE CASE I THINK PARTLY BECAUSE SO MANY SO MANY COMMUNITIES ALREADY MARKETS AND PRECISELY BECAUSE IT IS THE DAY WHEN THE BRITISH ARMY SUFFERED THE SINGLE HEAVIEST LOSSES IT IN ONE DAY
I THINK THE OTHER REASON THAT IT MATTERS IS THAT
HE GOES BACK TO THE POINT ABOUT THIS BEING A CITIZEN ARMY SO MANY SMALL COMMUNITIES WERE DIRECTLY AFFECTED MANY COMMUNITIES WERE SPARED BUT BECAUSE OF POWELL'S BATTALION RECRUITMENT BECAUSE FRIENDS GOING TO THE FAR END TO GO THE FRONT FRIENDS GOING FROM THE SAME STREETS OR FROM THE SAME WORKPLACES OFF IN THE SAME SCHOOLS
IF VAMP BATTALION SUFFERED HEAVY LOSSES ON THE FIRST JULY THEN THAT COMMUNITY WAS HIT TOO SO IT BROUGHT THE IMPACT OF THE WAR HOME LOCALLY RATHER THAN SIMPLY NATIONALLY IT REALLY MEANT SOMETHING TO LOCALITIES
# SIR HUGH STRON THERE SPEAKING TO JIM AND IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO SEVEN RAIN FORESTS DON'T NORMALLY BURN BUT RESEARCH LED BY PROFESSOR JOSS BARLOW FROM THE LANCASTER ENVIRONMENT CENTRE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS SHOWS THAT WHEN HUMANS AND THEIR FORESTS EVEN IF THEY'RE PROTECTING THEM
THEN THE RAINFORESTS BECOME MUCH MORE FLAMMABLE PROFESSOR JUST BARLOW AS I SAY HE'S FROM THE LANCASTER ENVIRONMENT CENTRE AND LED TO THAT STUDY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING RAIN DON'T NORMALLY BURNS IF WHAT IF HUMANS WERE NOWHERE NEAR RAINFORESTS THERE WOULDN'T BE FAR
THAT'S TRUE THERE IS A HISTORY OF WILDFIRE WITHIN THE RAINFOREST BUT MAYBE THOSE FIRE RETURNING TO FOOLS MAYBE EVERY THOUSAND YEARS AS A FIRE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IT'S ONLY RECENTLY THAT FIRES HAVE A TURNING EVERY DECADE OR MORE FREQUENTLY AND YOU SUGGEST THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE HUMANS NEARBY INVOLVED IN SOME ACTIVITY EVEN IF THEY'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THE RAINFOREST
THE FIRST OF THE GET THE BURNING FOR VARIOUS REASONS IN PART IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE LOGGED THOSE FORESTS MAKE THEM MORE FLAMMABLE BECAUSE THE THE THE CANOPY IS MORE OPEN THE UNDERSTOREY TRIES OUT MORE IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF THE HUMAN ACTIONS IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE FOREST SUCH AS AGRICULTURE AND ROADS TO SAY THAT THAT'S WHERE THE IGNITION SOURCES COME FROM OH KIM BUT YOU WERE LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT FOREST COVER THE AREAS THAT WERE PROTECTED AND WHAT DID YOU FIND
SO WE LOOKED AT A RANGE OF DIFFERENT FOREST COVERS BUT ON THE MOST EXCITING AND STARK EXAMPLES IS IS WHERE BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ACQUIRE LAND HOLDERS TO MAINTAIN EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE ORIGINAL FOREST COVER DISAPPEAR A VERY POSITIVE SCENARIO FOR MOST ENVIRONMENTALISTS WE FOUND THAT THE RESULTING LANDSCAPES ONLY RETAINED AROUND FIFTY PER CENT OF THEIR POTENTIAL VALUE BECAUSE OF THINGS SUCH AS LOGGING AND FIRE
SO WHAT WHERE WE MIGHT BE THINKING GREAT THERE'S EIGHTY PER CENT FOREST COVER YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOT NOWHERE NEARER EIGHTY PER CENT EXACTLY SO WHAT IS THE ANSWER
WELL FIRST OF ALL I THINK POLICY MAKERS ARE RIGHT TO FOCUS ON REEF PRODUCING DEFORESTATION THEY NEED TO CONTINUE DOING THAT BECAUSE ANY FIRST IS BETTER THAN NO FOREST BUT OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT WE NEED TO GO MUCH FURTHER IMPROVE THE MONITOR REGULATION OF FOREST DISTURBANCE SUCH A SELECTIVE LOGGING AND FIRE
RIGHT AND AS FAR AS THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF FOREST COVER AND THAT SHOULD BE PUSHED HIGHER SHOULD
I THINK THE EIGHTY PER CENT FIRST COVER IS THAT AS HIGH AS IT WILL BE EVER IT'S NOT PRACTICAL TO TRY AND PUSH THAT HIGHER BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN HIS VERY LARGE BLOCKS OF FOREST IN THE PROTECTED AREAS RECENTLY SOME OF THESE LARGE PROTECTED AREAS HAVE BECOME UNDER THREAT BUT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THOSE BUT IF YOU HAVE EIGHTY PER CENT OF FOREST COVER WHY DOES IT END UP ONLY BEING FIFTY AT THE EFFECTIVELY FIFTY PER CENT
EFFECTIVELY IT'S FIFTY PERCENT BECAUSE OF THE DISTURBANCE WHEN YOU LOG A FORESTER YOU HAVE A FIRE WHEN YOU START TO LOSE THE THE TYPICAL SPECIES OF THE PRIMARY RAINFORESTS SO YOU LOSING THE BIRDS WITH THE WITH THE THAT ARE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANETS AND INCREASING THEIR RISK OF PLAY WILL EXTINCTION
RIGHT SO ULTIMATELY THOUGH FROM WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IT IS THE FIRE THAT'S DOING THE DAMAGE
IT'S DIFFICULT TO POINT YOUR FINGER AT A PARTICULAR DISTURBANCE BUT IT'S JUST MY EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN THOSE LANDSCAPES WE'VE SEEN THE WILD FIRES HAPPEN TIP IN THE LAST YEAR AND IT IS THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON ANY ON THE BIODIVERSITY THAT'S REMAINING AND IS THE RATE OF FIRE INCREASING YEAH EVIDENCE ARE SHOWN AT THE RATE OF FIRE'S INCREASING IN THERE AND JUST IN THE LAST YEAR WERE DOING ON GAME RESEARCH THERE AND HALF OF US STUDY PLOTS BENT AT THE END OF TWENTY FIFTEEN
AND YOU WHAT YOU LOOKED AT A WHOLE RANGE I THINK DIDN'T YOU A WHOLE RANGE OF DIFFERENT FOREST TYPED A WHOLE RANGE OF DIFFERENT PERCENTAGE OF LAND COVER CENTRE OF FOREST COVER REMAIN IN THE LANDSCAPE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE SUITE OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES IN THAT REGION PROFESSOR JUST BARLOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
# SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN EVERY GOVERNMENT IN LIVING MEMORY HAS PROMISED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT IT WILL NARROW THE GAP BETWEEN PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF SOCIETY ON THOSE AT THE BOTTOM MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE UP THE SOCIAL LADDER BUT THE LATEST SOCIAL ATTITUDE SURVEYS WHOSE PEOPLE THINK IT'S EVEN HARDER NOW THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST MIRANDA PHILLIPS IS THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR OF THE BRITISH SOCIAL ATTITUDES SURVEY SHOWS THAT THEY COULD MORNING HUGH MORNING WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT
WELL THE REPORT OUT TODAY FROM THAT SOME SOCIAL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE'S A PERCEPTION OF A CLASS DIVIDE IN BRITAIN AND IT'S PRETTY STRONG EVIDENCE SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF US SAY THAT THERE'S A CLASS DIVIDE THAT'S WIDE OR VERY WIDE
AND A SIMILAR PROPORTION SEVENTY THREE PERCENT SAY THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO MOVE BETWEEN THE CLASSES AND THAT PROPORTION IS ACTUALLY INCREASED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF LIVING THROUGH RECESSION HAS ACTUALLY HAS SHARPENED PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF THIS CLASSIFIED AND WE CAN SAFELY SAY CAN WE THAT THAT PERCEPTION IS THE REALITY BECAUSE AFTER ALL IF THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF THEM PRESUMABLY THEY WON'T TRY TO LEAP UP TO THE NEXT RUNG OF THE LADDER OR WHATEVER AND THEREFORE IT BECOMES SELF FULFILLING
PERCEPTIONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN THINGS LIKE THIS AND THERE IS OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE TO THAT SOCIAL MOBILITY IS HARDER NOW THAN IT USED TO BE BUT THE BRITISH SOCIAL ATTITUDES SURVEY IS ALL ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK AND PERCEIVE THAT PERCEIVED TO BE GOING ON AND CERTAINLY IT DOES SEEM THAT PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO FEEL IT'S POSSIBLE TO MOVE UP THROUGH THE CLASSES
BUT FASCINATING WHEN WE LOOK AT CLASS IDENTITY THAT'S WHEN WE ASKED PEOPLE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE WORKING CLASS OR MIDDLE CLASS AT AROUND SIX IN TEN PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE WORKING CLASS AND THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT MAP ON TO THE PROPORTION WHO HAVE A WORKING CLASS JOB SO WE KNOW THAT AFTER THE DECLINE IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES FOR EXAMPLE THE PROPORTION WITH THE WORKING CLASS JOB IS REALLY IN A MINORITY NOW ARISING HORTA THAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT YOU'D THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE OPPOSITE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE SAYING THEY'RE MIDDLE CLASS
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ASPIRATION IN TERMS OF DOING BETTER IN IN YOUR LIFE PERHAPS SEEKING A A HIGHER PAID JOB OR A BETTER SKILLED JOB BUT WHAT IS FASCINATING HERE IS THAT IT SEEMS THAT IDENTITY IS SOMETHING THAT'S MORE INGRAINED AND CERTAINLY IN THE ANALYSIS WE'VE DONE IT'S CLEAR THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO SAY THEY FEEL WORKING CLASS EVEN IF THEY'VE GOT A MANAGERIAL OR A PROFESSIONAL JOB
IF THEIR FATHER HAD A WORKING CLASS AND IF THEY THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE A DEGREE SO RELATES TO THEIR BACKGROUND SO IT'S IT'S NOT SO MUCH RESENTMENT THEN AS PRIDE ALMOST IS IS THAT POSSIBLE IN OTHER WORDS YOU KNOW I'M WORKING CLASS AND PROUD OF IT IS IS THERE AN ELEMENT OF THAT IS IT I THINK THAT'S TRUE I MEAN
THERE IS AN IDEA THAT PERHAPS IT'S JUST MORE EMBEDDED OR INGRAINED AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY PEOPLE CHOOSING TO BE ONE OR THE OTHER SO I THINK IT'S PERHAPS NOT SO MUCH NOT CONSCIENCE YOU MEAN WHEN THE PEOPLE HAVEN'T GIVEN A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT INTO CIDER YES I THINK ON BALANCE I'M WORKING CLASS THEY JUST I THINK AND I THINK IT IS S. S. AN INGRAINED FEELING THAT'S TO DO WITH WHERE YOU COME FROM AND TO LOOKING LOOKING AT YOUR RATES BUT WE DO KNOW WE DID SOME QUALITATIVE WORK ON THIS THIS IS MORE IN DEPTH INTERVIEWS SOME YEARS AGO
WE KNOW THERE'S ALSO A SENSE OF BEING TRUE TO YOUR ROOTS ARE NOT BEING A FAKE IF YOU LIKE SO SO I THINK A LOT OF FACTORS ARE COMBINING TO GIVE SOMEONE A FEELING THAT THEY'RE EITHER WORKING CLASS BUT GIVEN THAT THAT ATTITUDE PERSISTS OR DOES IT MEAN THE PEOPLE HAVE LOST FAITH IN POLITICIANS ABILITY TO CHANGE THEIR SOCIAL STRUCTURE OUGHT TO IMPROVE THEIR LIFE TO HELP THEM IMPROVE THEIR LIFE CHANCES
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'VE LOOKED UP DIRECTLY AND I DATE IT WOULDN'T LET US DO THAT BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT TRUST IN POLITICIANS HAS BEEN LAID FOR SOME TIME HASN'T IT ALWAYS BEEN LEARNED IT PRETTY MUCH OUR SURVEY'S BEEN RUNNING NOW FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND IT IT'S FLUCTUATES BUT IT IT'S PRETTY OUT THE PUBLIC ARE PRETTY SCEPTICAL
WHAT WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS EVIDENCE ON THE CLASS IDENTITY IS THAT IT PERHAPS EXPLAINS SOME OF THE SOCIAL DIVISIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR SOCIETY PARTICULARLY SINCE THE VOTE LAST WEEK IF YOU HAVE SIX IN TEN PEOPLE WHO FEEL WORKING CLASS THOSE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO PERCEIVE A CLASS DIVIDE AND TO THINK IT'S HARD TO MOVE BETWEEN THE CLASSES
THEN IT SUGGESTS AN INCREASED DISCONNECT BETWEEN THERE AND AND MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE AND THAT ISN'T GOING TO BE GOOD IN TERMS OF UNITING THE COUNTRY GOING FORWARD VERY INTERESTING BERNARD PHILIP THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
# THANK YOU IT'S NOW THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST PETER GIBBS HERE THANKS VERY MUCH SARAH A BETTER CHANCE OF STAYING DRY TODAY BUT NOT COMPLETELY THAT'S FOR SURE AND A RATHER SHOWERY IN COOL OUTLOOK TO THE REST OF THE WEEK BUT ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES AT THE MOMENT MOST PLACES ARE STARTING DRY A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE HERE AND THERE AS WELL PARTICULARLY ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND THROUGH THE MIDLANDS BUT A BIT OF RAIN AROUND FOR THE SOUTH EAST JUST TO START WITH THAT WILL TEND TO CLEAR AWAY OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS
REPLACED BY JUST ONE OR TWO SCATTERED SHOWERS BUT THEN LATER IN THE DAY SOME MORE PERSISTENT RAIN GETS INTO NORTHWEST ENGLAND WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND TEMPERATURES MID TO HIGH TEENS BUT COULD GOES HIGH TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO IN SOME BRIGHTER PARTS OF EASTERN ENGLAND A CLOUDY DAY AHEAD SO FOR NORTHERN IRELAND SOME OUTBREAKS OF SHOWERY RAIN WHICH COULD TURN HEAVY AT TIMES PARTICULARLY THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON COOL AND BREEZY HERE AS WELL JUST FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN DEGREES THE HIGH
ACROSS SCOTLAND EASTERN SCOTLAND GETTING THE BEST DEAL AS FAR AS A DRY AND BRIGHT WEATHER IS CONCERNED ACROSS NORTHERN SCOTLAND AND SOUTH WEST SCOTLAND IT WILL BE CLOUDIER QUITE SHOWERY AT TIMES AS WELL AND A COOL BREEZE BLOWING IN HERE JUST FOURTEEN DEGREES IN THE WEST AROUND ABOUT EIGHTEEN DEGREES IN THE EAST TONIGHT BIT OF RAIN FOR MOST OF US THAT'LL CLEAR TO SUNNY SPELLS AND SCATTERED HEAVY SHOWERS TOMORROW WITH A RATHER COOL BREEZE AND THAT'S THE THEME TAKES US RIGHT INTO THE WEEK

YOU MAY ALREADY HAVE DRIVEN ON WHAT'S CALLED A SMART MOTORWAY WHERE THE HARD SHOULDER IS OPEN TO TRAFFIC TEMPORARILY WHEN IT'S REALLY BUSY THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO EXTEND THE IDEA SO THAT THE HARD SHOULDER IS USED ALL OF THE TIME ON AROUND THREE HUNDRED MILES OF MOTORWAY CALLED ALL LANE RUNNING IT'S A RELATIVELY CHEAP WAY OF WIDENING ROADS BUT THE TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE SAYS IT'S WORRIED THE NEW DESIGN ISN'T SAFE
IT ARGUES THE EMERGENCY RUN OFF AREAS ARE TOO SMALL TOO FAR APART AND OFTEN GET BLOCKED UP BY DRIVERS ESPECIALLY OVERSEAS LORRY DRIVERS WERE JUST TAKING A BREAK IT'S ALSO SAYS THAT IT'S HARD TO CLOSE SECTIONS OFF IN AN EMERGENCY THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE SYSTEMS ALREADY BEEN TRIALLED ON THE M.

# THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN ANGELA EAGLE THE FORMER SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY WILL CHALLENGE JEREMY CORBIN FOR THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP TODAY SHE'S EXPECTED TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT LITTLE BIT LATER MY CORBETT HIS FACE MANY CALLS TO RESIGN BUT HE STILL HAS THE BACKING OF THE BIG TRADE UNIONS AND MANY PARTY ACTIVISTS
AND AT A RALLY OF SUPPORTERS LAST NIGHT HE INSISTED HE WOULD CARRY ON OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICE HAS BEEN TO STOKE WHERE ALL THREE CONSTITUENCIES ARE HELD BY LABOUR BUT WHERE MOST VOTERS CHOSE TO LEAVE THE E.U. HE SET OUT TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY THINK OF THE PARTY'S LEADER
AT THE CENTRE OF STOKE A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STANDING CHATTING ROUND A BICYCLE
MUSIC'S PLAYING FROM THE SPEAKER THAT'S BEEN STRAPPED TO THE CROSS CAR A FEW MEN WHO LOOKED CLOSE TO RETIREMENT ARE HANGING AROUND
TO BE WHY USED TO BE HEAVEN INTO THE LEAD AT THE START CORNS NO HE'S NO THING LIZZIE
THESE WERE TO BE REFUGEES HELPING THEM OR YOUR LABOUR
USED TO BE FOR NOT THAT WRONG WHY NOT IT WAS WHERE DO YOU KNOW IT
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TOWNS THAT FEELS FOR TERRY LEFT BEHIND I'M WANDERING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF STOKE NOW IT'S SIX IN THE EVENING AND JUST LISTEN
THERE'S BARELY ANYONE
IT'S A TOWN WITH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT THE JOBS THAT DO EXIST ARE LOW SKILLED IT SHOULD BE RICH PICKINGS FOR LABOUR IT ALWAYS USED TO BE
THE REFERENDUM BROUGHT BACK TWO VOTES AMON WAS THE NOW BUT THE OTHER WAS A RESPONSE TO SARAH
THIS IS RUTH ROSA NOW A LOCAL LABOUR COUNCILLOR SHE AND HER FELLOW LABOUR COUNCILLOR CHRIS ROBINSON BELIEVE THE REFERENDUM RESULT PROVIDES A CLEAR ANSWER AS TO WHO SHOULD LEAD THEIR PARTY IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THOSE BOATS WERE REALLY HARD
THE THE MOST DEPRIVED AREAS AND WHAT THE SAME AS WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS THIS IS A PROTEST BOATS IF YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE AUSTERITY ISSUE
JEREMY CORBIN HAS BEEN BANGING ON ABOUT THAT THAT WOULD THEN SEEM TO SAY THAT HE IS THE RIGHT MAN TO CONTINUE LEADING THE PROPERTY I ABSOLUTELY THINK EARS WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT WE FOUGHT FOR HIS ELECTION TO GET TO GET HIM ELECTED TO LEAD IT SO DID THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERSHIP
AND I THINK IT'S A LEADERSHIP ELECTION COME TOMORROW NEXT WEEK WHEN ABI HE WOULD GET RE ELECTED THE DIFFICULT QUESTION THEN FOR YOU YOUR LOCAL COUNCIL IS IN STOKE WHO SUPPORT YOUR NATIONAL LEADER
AND YET YOUR LOCAL M.P. DOES NOT SUPPORT THE LEADERSHIP HEY THAT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT ONE FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE PER CENT OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE LABOUR PARTY SAID THEY WANTED CORBIN AS LEADER SURELY OUR LOYALTY LIES WITH THOSE
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A DANGER IN THE WAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT CLEARLY BUT THE QUOTES ELITES OF LONDON DIDN'T LISTEN TO THEM OVER YOU
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A DANGER IN YOUR PARTY THAT THE QUOTES ELITES OF LONDON WON'T LISTEN TO YOU OVER CORBIN ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THE WESTMINSTER BUBBLE AND THE P.L. PENNY ABSOLUTELY TRYING TO SAY LET'S HAVE A NEW LEADER AND ACROSS TO ITS MEMBERS ARE ABSOLUTELY
NO WE WON'T CALL WHEN WE CHOSE CORBY WE WANTED TO RETURN TO THOSE CORE VALUES OF LABOUR
AND GOES TO VOTE AGAIN
MATTHEW PRICE THERE INSTEAD WELL THE M.P. BARRY GARDNER BECAME THE SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE WITH THIS WEEK WHEN THERE WAS A MASS EXODUS FROM JEREMY CORBIN'S TEAM AND HE'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IT'S YOUR DEPUTY LEADER RIGHT TOM WATSON WHEN HE SAYS THAT THE PARTY NOW FACES AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS YES I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE WE HAVE
FOR THE PAST NINE MONTHS HAD A LEADER THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY DON'T SUPPORT
THAT'S BEEN THE SITUATION IT'S NOTHING NEW TO YOUR EARLIER PROGRAMME I THINK SAID THAT HE'D LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE HIPPY L.P. IN FACT HE NEVER HAD IT BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE P. L. P. DOESN'T OWN THE LABOUR PARTY
THE PARTY IS MADE UP OF ITS MEMBERSHIP AND THEY VOTED JUST NINE MONTHS AGO FIFTY NINE PERCENT OF THEM TO HAVE JEREMY AS LEADER IS IT TRUE THAT YOU WERE THE ONLY M.P. WHO SPOKE UP FOR HIM AT THE PUB AT THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PUT THAT MEETING ON MONDAY LET ME BE CLEAR KNOW WHAT I DID WAS I SAID THAT I FOUND IT INCONCEIVABLE
VETA TOUCH TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAD A PRIME MINISTER WHO HAD BEEN FORCED TO RESIGN BECAUSE HE HAD CAUSED A REFERENDUM AND NEEDLESS REFERENDUM SIMPLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF KEEPING HIS OWN BACKBENCHERS ON SIDE IN HIS OWN PARTY WHEN THE POUND HAD CRASHED TO A THIRTY FIVE YEAR LOW AND THE STOCK MARKET HAD COLLAPSED
WHEN WE WERE SEEING ALL THESE SIGNS OF PANIC AND INSTABILITY IN THE COUNTRY I THOUGHT IT WAS INCREDIBLE THAT MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LABOUR PARTY THOUGHT IT MORE IMPORTANT TO TURN IN ON THEMSELVES AND HAVE A DISPUTE ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE LEADING THE PARTY THAN TO ACTUALLY STAND AT THE DESPATCH BOX AND ATTACK THE GOVERNMENT
FOR THE CRISIS THAT THEY HAD PRECIPITATE IT DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY FEAR WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO LABOUR AT A GENERAL ELECTION THIS HAS BEEN A PLOT THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR MANY MANY MONTHS IT HAS BEEN ORCHESTRATED AND I THINK ACTUALLY IT WAS RUSHED OUT BECAUSE
NOBODY EXPECTED THE BRECHT'S IT RESULT TO GO THE WAY IT DID AND SUDDENLY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY NOW THAT WAS A MISTAKE BECAUSE IT MEANT THAT AT A CRITICAL TIME IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS LET OFF THE HOOK I WANT TO HOLD THE GOVERNMENT TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT IT HAS DONE BUT WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE EVEN ED MILLIBAND COMES OUT AND SAYS THE SITUATION IS THAT'S UNSUSTAINABLE AND HE'S CALLING ON HIM WHILE HE'S NOT LEAST
WHAT IF HE IF HE KNOWS THEN IS HE RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS JEREMY CORBIN SHOULD GO HE MAKES THE ARGUMENT MY JUDGEMENT IS THOSE CAUSES FOR WHICH JEREMY FIGHTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SERVED IF YOU GOES IS HE RIGHT LOOK SO YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT AN EX STENCIL CRISIS WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY MY VIEW IS THAT WE ARE SEEING A COMPLETE FRAGMENTATION OF THE
WHAT USED TO BE TAKEN AS THE CORE SUPPORT FOR EACH OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND I THINK BRITISH POLITICS IS BREAKING UP AND IN AN INCREDIBLY RAPID AND INTERESTING WAY THE DEMOGRAPHY OF BRITAIN IS IS FORCING THAT
WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY IS AT THE REFERENDUM
MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO FELT THAT THEIR CONSTITUENTS WOULD PROBABLY VOTE FOR BRECK'S IT THERE WERE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO DID NOT WANT TO GO OUT AND CAMPAIGN FOR REMAIN AND BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT IT WOULD PREJUDICE THEIR CHANCES AT A FUTURE GENERAL ELECTION SO WOULD WE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ELECTION NOW LEADERSHIP ELECTION
ANGELA EAGLE'S GOING I WELCOME THAT BY THE WAY I DO I REALLY DO BECAUSE THIS IS THE WILLOWS VOTE FOR JEREMY CORBIN AGAINST ANGELE I'LL WAIT AND SEE WHO STANDS THERE WILL BE NO ANGELA EAGLE WE KNOW ANGELA STANDING AND I SUSPECT THAT THERE WILL BE OTHERS WHO COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK I WILL JUDGE ALL THE CANVAS AND THE MET LOOK LET ME BE CLEAR I DID NOT KNOW WHAT EMILY GOING TO JEREMY CORBIN I DID NOT SUPPORT JAMMY AS LEADER I DID NOT VOTE FOR HIM AS LEADER AND I DID NOT AND NOMINATE IN THIS LEADER
BUT I WILL NOT SEE THE GOVERNMENT LET OFF THE HOOK AND THE LOGICAL CONCERT IT WHAT ABOUT YOU LOT THAT WILL BE ON THE TEAM I KNOW THE LOGICAL ANSWER TEAM AT SIR FOR THOSE OFF EVERYONE RESIGNING WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EMPTY DESPATCH BOX ACROSS
THE TABLE FROM MINISTERS YOU CANNOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE NO PROPER OPPOSITION BUT JUST FOR THOSE OF US OUTSIDE ONE OF THE PRESUMPTIONS YOU SEE ALL HIS TEAM RESIGNING YOU PRESUME THAT'S PARTLY ON WHAT THEY KNOW OF THE WAY HE LEADS NOW YOU'VE BEEN IN THAT TEAM YOU'RE A MORE SENIOR POSITION NOW
IS HE A LEADER LOOK FIFTY NINE PER CENT OF OUR PARTY ELECTED TO MISLEAD HER THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS PEOPLE ARE SAYING OF BRECK'S IT BARRY FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY VOTED FOR IT THEREFORE WE MUST RESPECT THAT THEY MUST ALSO RESPECT THE FACT THAT HE HAS A MANDATE FROM THE PARTY WE HAVE A PROCESS ARRY FOLLOW AND THAT CHALLENGE WILL BE MADE AND IT WILL BE FOLLOWED THROUGH WE'LL SEE WHO EMERGES AS THE LEADER AT THE END OF THAT BARRY GARDNER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
# EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S BEEN AND HERE'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT FOR YOU IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT WEEK A TRICKY WEEK FOR THE BANKS AND SO FAR NONE OF THEM AS WANTED TO SPEAK TO US BUT NOW FINALLY ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO PUT HER HEAD ABOVE THE PARAPET DOMINIC IT IS
YES YOU'RE RIGHT JOHN WELL IT IS JANE ANGER DEAR MADE OF STERNER STUFF THAN THE CHIEF EXECS OF BS AND BARCLAYS WE ASKED HIM TO COME AND TALK ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE MARKET OR THE BIG BANKS THE SHARE PRICES ARE DOWN ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT SAINT THAT SINCE THE VOTE THEY DIDN'T WANNA COME ALONG BUT JANE ANCHOR DEAR DID JANE AND YOUR SHARES ARE DOWN AS WELL I THINK BEFORE THE VOTE YOU ARE TRAINING AS HIGH AS ABOUT THREE POUNDS THIRTY NOW ABOUT TWO POUNDS FORTY BUT MORE RELIC BUT YESTERDAY SHE WAS DOWN ABOUT A THIRD
WHY ARE INVESTORS TURNING THEIR BACKS ON U.K. BANKS WELL FIRST OF ALL DONE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT BANKING INTO WAYNE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND IN SOCIETY AND HOW INVESTORS ARE LOOKING AT US AND THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
SO FROM AN INVESTOR PERSPECTIVE OF COURSE INVESTORS DON'T LIKE UNCERTAINTY AND THEY DON'T LIKE SHOCKS AND BECKS IT WAS HER BOTH OF THOSE THINGS IT WAS A SURPRISE THAT GAVE AN UNCERTAIN VIEW OF THE MARKET GOING FORWARDS THAT'S AFFECTED BACK SHARE PRICES BECAUSE BANKS ARE SO ATTACHED TO A VIEW OF THE U.K. ECONOMY BUT THE THING I SHOULD MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR FOR I THINK FOR ALL BANKS IS THAT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY THE REGULATORS AND OTHERS SINCE
FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS MADE BANK STRONG WELL CAPITALISED HIGHLY LIQUID REALLY FOCUSED ON CUSTOMERS AND BANKS LIKE VIRGIN MONEY ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO GIVE GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE TO BE REALLY STRONG CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A GREAT BRITISH ECONOMY AND THAT WILL COME BACK IN BANKS SHARE PRICES VERY SOON I BELIEVE ONE OF THINGS THAT'S WEIGHING ON BANK SHARE PRICES AND YOURS AT VIRGIN MONEY I THINK IS THE PROSPECT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES
IT'S QUITE LIKELY THE BANK OF ENGLAND CUT INTEREST RATES AGAIN THANKS FIND IT HARD TO MAKE MONEY WITH INTEREST RATES ARE LOW DON'T THEY I THINK THAT THE VIEW ON INTEREST RATES GOING FORWARD OBVIOUSLY ISN'T FOR ME IT'S FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE LOOKING AT THIS MUCH MORE BROADLY AS FAR AS THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY IS CONCERNED OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNOR'S GOING TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR ECONOMY TO THRIVE POST BRECHT
AND FOR ME THE A THRIVING U.K. ECONOMY IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FOR OUR SOCIETY OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR BANKS IN THE SPECIFICS OF INTEREST RATES BECAUSE ALTHOUGH WE'LL ALL HAVE TO BE CREATIVE TO MANAGE THROUGH THAT ENVIRONMENT WILL DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO DO THAT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN ON HOUSE PRICES WE HAD PROFESSOR DAVID MILES ON EARLIER A FORMER MEMBER OF THE M.P.C.
WHO SAID THAT GEORGE OSBORNE'S BIG WARNING ON HOUSE PRICES WAS ACTUALLY A BIT OVER THE TOP WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN ON HOUSE PRICES WELL AGAIN I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL BUT I THINK THAT PROVIDING THAT WE RETAIN CONFIDENCE THAN ACTUALLY OUR ECONOMY AND SOCIETY WILL CONTINUE TO THRIVE
SO I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD NOT PANIC THEY SHOULD CONTINUE TO THEIR MOVE TO INVEST IN THEIR HOMES AND EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS PRE BRECK'S IT AND THAT'S THE WAY TO SUSTAIN A GOOD HOUSING MARKET SO MY MY MESSAGE ABSOLUTELY AGES IN A POST BRECK'S IT WE SHOULD ALL GET TOGETHER AND HAVE CONFIDENCE ABOUT OUR FUTURE AND THAT CONFIDENCE WILL COME THROUGH TO HOUSING MARKET AND TO SHARE PRICES AND OUR ECONOMY OVERALL THANK YOU MUCH JEN DIE A VIRGIN MONEY
# IF IT WAS DORIC AT TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S THE GOVERNMENT FIRST SUGGESTED THAT MOTORWAY HARD SHOULDERS SHOULD BE USED AS NORMAL LING'S MUCH CHEAPER WAY OF CUTTING CONGESTION AND BUILDING NEW LANES WERE M.P.S SAY THEY ARE NOT CONVINCED THAT IT ISN'T A BIT RISKY LEWES' ALMAN IS A LABOUR M.P. CHAIRS THE COMMONS TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE AND SHE'S WITH ME ARE RISKY FOR THE OBVIOUS REASON I SUPPOSE THAT YOU'VE NOWHERE TO ESCAPE TO
THAT'S RIGHT THE GOVERNMENT WANT TO MAKE A VERY BASIC CHANGE AND WE ALREADY HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED SMART MOTORWAYS WERE THE HARD SHOULDER MIGHT BE TAKEN OUT OF USE FOR SOME OF THE TIME THE EMPEROR THAT'S RIGHT WHERE THERE ARE VARIABLE SPEEDS AND INFORMATION FOR MOTORISTS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THE GOVERNMENT NOW PLAN TO GO AHEAD WITH THREE HUNDRED MILES OF MOTORWAY WITH NO HARD SHOULDER AT ANY TIME
WITH FAR FEWER REFUGE AREAS FOR VEHICLES TO GO TO WHEN THEY BREAK DOWN THERE WITH LES INFORMATIONS AROUND ON THE MOTORWAY SO MOTE WAS JUST WHAT IS HAPPENING AND ON THESE TROUSERS HAVE BEEN HELD SO FAR AND ONLY TWELVE MONTHS OF TRIALS ON PART OF THE M. TWENTY FIVE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT BRINGS SOME EXTREMELY INCREASED RISK
WHEN VEHICLES BREAKDOWN ON A ALIVE LANE A BREAKDOWN HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET OFF THAT LIVE LANE HOW THE EMERGENCY SERVICE IS GOING TO GET TO THEM THE RISK IS MUCH HIGHER THE GOVERNMENT WANT TO PLOUGH AHEAD BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER HAVE THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTS AS A RESULT A BIT OF THOSE TRIALS THAT IS
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ACCIDENTS THERE WAS ONE FATAL ACCIDENT WHEN SOMEBODY DID BREAK DOWN ON A LIVE LANE AT NIGHT AND THERE WERE FATALITIES AND THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT DOES HAPPEN ON PROPERLY AS IT WERE TO SAFETY LANES ANYWAY DOESN'T IT I MEAN WE'VE GOT A SHOULDER ANYWAY THERE ARE ACCIDENTS AT THAT PARTICULAR ACCIDENT HAPPENED IT'S STILL BEING INVESTIGATED TO SEE EXACTLY
WHITE OCCURRED CURTAIN AND WIFE THE PERSON INVOLVED HE'D DIE BUT NORMALLY THERE ARE THREE YEARS OF TRIALS ON VIEW SCHEMES BEFORE A DECISION IS MADE TO GRILL THEM OUT IN A VERY BIG WAY AND THIS TIME IT'S JUST BEEN TWELVE MONTHS OR EVALUATION YET HIGHWAYS ENGLAND TELL US AT SAY THINK THAT'S ENOUGH THEY GOING AHEAD WE'VE HEARD WARNINGS FROM THE EMERGENCY SERVICES
WARNINGS FROM VEHICLE OPERATOR REMOVALS AND FROM OTHER PEOPLE USING THE MOTORWAY THAT THE REAL DANGER THE INCREASED RISK IS IN THAT LIFE WHEN PEOPLE GREATER IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW I THINK DON'T WE THAT TRAFFIC JAMS IN AND OF THEMSELVES CAN CAUSE ACCIDENTS BECAUSE CARS HAVE TO SLOW DOWN OTHER CARS GOLD AND ALL THE REST OF IT THAT SIMPLY
MOVING THE TRAFFIC OR MORE STEADILY WHICH CLEARLY YOU WOULD DO WITH FOUR LANES RATHER THAN THREE BUT THAT IN ITSELF MIGHT HELP TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE HARD SHOULDER CLEARLY THERE WOULD BE THE PROBLEMS YOU DESCRIBE BUT MIGHT THERE BE BENEFITS AS WELL WITH THE M. FORTY TWO SCHEME TOSS WORK AND THAT JUST KEEP THE TRAFFIC MOVING AND IT'S A SAFE IN MANY RESPECTS BUT THERE'S A PLANTS NOW FOR WHAT'S BEING CALLED ALL THE RUNNING
IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT IT'S NO HARD SHOULDER AT ALL AND HAVING FOUR FUEL REFUGE AREAS AND THAT'S VERY CRITICAL TO WOULD YOU BE HAPPIER IF THE M. FORTY TWO PLAN WAS EXTENDED THAT'S TO SAY AS I UNDERSTAND IT ANYWAY USING THE MOTORWAY THE RAIN THE HARD SHOULDER COMES INTO USE ONLY WHEN IT'S NEEDED NOT TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THE M. FORTY TWO WORKS
AND IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THAT WAS EXTENDED AND THEN THE WHORE CHILDREN MIGHT BE TAKEN OUT OF USE WHEN REQUIRED BUT NOT PERMANENTLY AND THEY'RE A REFUGE AREAS FOR BROKEN DOWN COST TO GET TO WITHIN ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED METRES THE PLANS FOR WHAT'S CALLED ALL THEY RUNNING A VERY DRASTIC CHANGE IS FOR THAT SPACING TO BE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRES AT THE LONGER BLONDE I'M NOT MOTHER IT'S A LONG AT THE MOMENT IT'S A LONG GAP AND THE EMERGENCY SERVICES TELL US THAT IF HER
AT DIG THIS BROKEN ON THE LIVE MOTORWAY THERE MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO THE JUNCTION MILES AHEAD AND COMPACT AND ALSO THERE'S INFRINGEMENT OF THE LAWS AND KNOW WHEN THERE ARE MOTORWAYS CLOSE DOWN BECAUSE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT ON IT THERE IS AN INFRINGEMENT ABOUT EVERY FOUR MINUTES SO THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION PEOPLE NOT KNOWING THE REGULATIONS AND THE LAW'S NOT BEING AND FALL IN A SINGLE WORD YOUR COMMITTEE SAYING THINK AGAIN WE'RE SAYING THINK AGAIN BEFORE YOU GO AHEAD WITH THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# IT'S NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN CHILDREN HAVING HEART TREATMENT AT BRISTOL CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL WERE REPEATEDLY GIVEN POOR CARE AND THEIR PARENTS WERE LET DOWN THAT'S THE FINDING OF AN INDEPENDENT REPORT CHAIRED BY THE Q.C. ELEANOR GRAY SHE WAS ASKED BY THE N.H.S. TO LOOK AT THE SPECIALIST UNIT AFTER COMPLAINTS BY THE FAMILIES OF CHILDREN TREATED THERE SHE FOUND NURSES WERE REGULARLY UNDER PRESSURE CHILDREN WERE PUT AT RISK OF HARM AND THERE WAS POOR COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILIES AND SHE'S CALLED FOR A WIDER INQUIRY
INTO A PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE SERVICES AND ENGLISH IN ENGLAND AND ELEANOR GRAY HE'S IN BRISTOL NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOW YOU WERE OFF TO LOOK AT THIS AS I SAY WHEN FAMILIES COMPLAINED AND NOTABLY WHERE FAMILIES WHERE CHILDREN HAD DIED
CAN YOU SAY THAT THOSE DEATHS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF THE CARE HAD BEEN BETTER NO I DON'T THINK WE CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT COMPARED TO THE FIRST PUBLIC INQUIRY BUT I WAS INVOLVED IN ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO
WHEN THE INQUIRY REVEALED WHAT'S CALLED EXCESS DEATHS IN THAT UGLY STATISTICAL TERM WE'VE NOW GOT A GOOD SYSTEM FOR REPORTING OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF MORTALITY RIGHT ACROSS THE U.K. AND THAT GUY AT THE OUTCOMES IN BRISTOL WERE COMPARABLE TO OTHER CENTRES ACROSS ENGLAND
BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE POOR CARE THE POOR EXPERIENCE OF CARE WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED THAT WHERE WE SEE WE SAW IT HAPPENING I CAN SEE THE OUTCOMES WERE COMPARABLE IN EFFECT WITH THE TREATMENT WAS THE SAME AS THEY WOULD HAVE GOT ANYWHERE ELSE SO YOU'RE SAYING EVERYWHERE THERE IS A RISK OF HARM AND PORK
NO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED AT CERTAIN TIMES BEFORE SOME REALLY QUITE FUNDAMENTAL AND IMPORTANT CHANGES WERE MADE IN BRISTOL THAT CHILDREN WERE RECEIVING POOR CARE IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF THE NURSING INPUT THE QUALITY OF COMMUNICATION ON THE WARD
IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX AREAS OF SURGERY AND TREATMENT IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO HIGHLIGHT OR TO IDENTIFY WHAT IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE HAD ON THE OUTCOMES FOR THE CHILD YOU'RE NO WHAT WE'VE DONE SORRY FORGIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE MOTHER OF ONE YOUNG BOY WHO DIED SAYS THAT A LOT OF THE FAMILIES ARE UNHAPPY WITH THEIR PERSONAL REPORTS THEY'RE UPSET THEY FEEL IT'S A COVER UP A WHITE WASH
WELL WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE RECOGNISES THAT I LOOKED AT THESE TOGETHER WITH A VERY LARGE EXPERT PANEL INVOLVED CLINICIANS NOT CONNECTED WITH BRISTOL BUT FROM LONDON FROM EDINBURGH FROM LEICESTER FROM NEWCASTLE
IT WAS THEIR JUDGEMENTS ABOUT THE CARE THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THOSE INDIVIDUAL REPORTS THAT WE DELIVERED PERSONALLY AND CONFIDENTIALLY TO FAMILIES AND WE'VE SAID THAT WE'LL MEET WITH THEM AND DISCUSS WHAT WE HAD TO SAY IN THOSE REPORTS AND A NATIONWIDE INQUIRY IS NOW REQUIRED
WELL THE NATIONAL REVIEW WE'VE ASKED N.H.S. ENGLAND HAVE A REVIEW OF THE PROVISION NURSE PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNITS BECAUSE WE THINK THAT WE SAW A LOT OF EVIDENCE OF PRESSURES ON FAMILIES BECAUSE OF CANCELLATION OF OPERATIONS AND WE THINK THAT THEY SORT OF PRECIOUS REALLY ONLY INCREASING AND IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT THAT NOT JUST IN BRISTOL BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND A GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH

THE MIRROR SAYS NOBODY CAN PREDICT WHERE ANGELA EAGLE'S CHALLENGE JEREMY CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP WILL END WITH THE PAPER ADS IT'S LIKELY TO BE MESSY WHEN MY CORBIN'S PRAETORIAN GUARD OF UNION LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS AND SHEATHING SWORDS AND HOLDING SHIELDS FIRM A BATTLE IS INEVITABLE ACCORDING TO THE MIRROR AND IT WON'T BE PRETTY THE EYE SAYS SOME CORBIN SUPPORTERS HAVE WAITED DECADES TO RE CLAIM OWNERSHIP OF THE LABOUR MOVEMENT THE PAPER GOES ON I WOULD NEVER FORGIVE EM PEAS IF THEY TRIED TO STOP THEIR LEADER FROM MAKING THE BALLOT PAPER
# THE SUN IS DISAPPOINTED THAT DURING PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS YESTERDAY DAVID CAMERON WAS NOT ABLE TO OFFER ANY REASSURANCE ABOUT THEIR LONG TERM FUTURE OF E.U. CITIZENS LIVING WORKING OR STUDYING HERE PAPER SAYS IT'S NOT FAIR THAT THEY FACE A SUMMER OF UNCERTAINTY UNTIL THE NEW PRIME MINISTER BEGINS NEGOTIATIONS OVER BRITAIN'S EXIT VINCENT SITS THERE IN BRITAIN LEGALLY THEY MUST BE TOLD UNEQUIVOCALLY THEY CAN STAY AND THE SAME GOES FOR BRITS LIVING ON THE CONTINENT
ACCORDING TO THE TIMES THE GOVERNMENT'S PREPARING TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE DECISION ON AIRPORT CAPACITY IS TO BE LEFT TO DAVID CAMERON SUCCESSOR IN A MOVE THAT IN EFFECT SPELLS THE END OF MOVES TO BUILD A THIRD RUNWAY AT HEATHROW IT SAYS BOTH BORIS JOHNSON AND THERESA MAY THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS OPPOSE HEATHROW EXPANSION OR MY CAMERAS CONCLUDED THERE'S LITTLE POINT TO MAKE A DECISION THAT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE OVERTURNED
# THE TIME IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AND WANTING TO THROW THEIR HAT IN THE RING TO LEAD THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND SO BE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER MUST DO SO BY MIDDAY TODAY THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS BORIS JOHNSON AND THERESA MAY WAS SET OUT THEIR COMPETING VISIONS FOR THE PARTY AND THE COUNTRY THE DAY PROGRAMMES ROSS HAWKINS HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO AND HOW THEY GOT TO THIS POINT
BORIS JOHNSON AND THERESA MAY HAVE HISTORY ALMOST TWELVE YEARS AGO HE WAS IN TROUBLE THAT'S WE'VE BEEN HEARING THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. BORIS JOHNSON HAS BEEN SACKED AS ONE OF THE PARTY'S VICE CHAIRMAN AND SACKED BOTH OF EM LEADER MICHAEL HOWARD ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT AN AFFAIR THE MORNING AFTER THE NEWS BROKE ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES SPOKE TO G. M. T. V. I THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE APPEARED TO STAN TO DENY THE STORIES WHICH NOW APPEAR TO BE TRUE I THINK MICHAEL HOWARD HAS DONE THE RIGHT THING
THAT SWIFT APPEARANCE ON THE AIRWAVES ON A DIFFICULT DAY ONE FRIEND OF BORIS JOHNSON TOLD ME LEAD TO BAD BLOOD AND A GENUINELY BAD RELATIONSHIP WITH THERESA MAY
STILL HIS CAREER ENDURED SEVEN YEARS LATER HE WAS THE MAYOR OF LONDON SHE THE HOME SECRETARY
BOTH ON HOLIDAY WHEN RIOTS ERUPTED ACROSS THE CAPITAL THERESA MAY WHO HADN'T TRAVELLED SO FAR GOT BACK FIRST TO MAKE HER STATEMENT SINCE SATURDAY NIGHT LONDONERS HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT THERE ARE NO EXCUSES FOR VIOLENCE CAN YOU HEAR ME AT THE BACK
AND BY THE TIME BORIS JOHNSON GOT A SAVERS IN CLAPHAM SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE HOME SECRETARY HE WAS THE ONE WHO FACE THE TOUGH QUESTIONS AND NO ONE WILL SEE IT TO BE FAIR AND THAT IS WHY I'VE GOT IN MIND MANY MORE POLICE ON THE STREET WHAT ABOUT ONE OF THE MORE DEFINING MOMENTS WAS IN THE RIOTS WHEN THEY CLEARLY AS HOME SECRETARY IN THERE NEEDED TO COMMUNICATE IT BECAME CLEAR
THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS SPEAK COMPLETELY CANDIDLY TO EACH OTHER STEVEN GREENHOUSE WHICH BORIS JOHNSON'S DEPUTY MAYOR FOR POLICING IN HIS SECOND TERM AFTER THE CLEAR UP THE MAYOR DECIDED LONDON'S POLICE STEVE WATER CANNON AND APPROVE THE PURCHASE OF THREE OF THEM BUT HE NEEDED THE HOME SECRETARY'S PERMISSION TO ACTUALLY USE THEM AND HE DIDN'T GET IT
I CAN INFORM THE HOUSE THAT I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO AUTHORISE THE VASSAR THERE FOR NINE THOUSAND WATER CANNON AS A POLICING TACTIC FOR OPERATIONAL USE IN ENGLAND AND WALES WE FELT LET DOWN THAT'S THE POINT THAT WE HAD GONE THIS FAR
AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO INDICATION THAT THE HOME SECRETARY WAS NOT GOING TO GRANT THE LICENCE IT WAS VERY MUCH THE REASON WHY WE FELT UPSET AT THE POINT AT THIS POINT ALL THIS AFTER BORIS JOHNSON HAVE BEEN MOCKED BY GEORGE OSBORNE IN THE BUDGET SPEECH TO SOME ALLIES SUSPECTED AN ATTEMPT TO HUMILIATE HIM TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE LONDON BASHING YOU MIGHT THINK THAT A CAPITAL WAS A MODERN BADDER
IN TRUTH THOUGH THEY CONFERENCE SPEECHES HAVE LONG FELT LIKE HUSTINGS AND OF COURSE
I WOULD YOU ARE BRITISH VALUES WILL WIN THE DAY AND WE WILL PROVE
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THOSE TWO CHARACTERS AS CLEAR TO CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS BY NOW AS IT IS TO PERSONAL FRIENDS LIKE CATHERINE MAYER WHO KNOWS THEM BOTH BUT HE'S CLOSE TO THERESA MAY BLACK AND WHITE
ABSOLUTE OPPOSITES ON A ONE TO ONE HE'S A BATTERED THAT ALSO I FIND IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO GET TO NOTE THEN TERESA SHE'S NOT AN EXTROVERT
PEOPLE ARE NOT RUSHING TO BE TAKEN PICTURE WITH HER BUT SHE'S JUST A STRAIGHT
COURAGEOUS CALM SACK TRAWLER PERSON
THE PERSON LETTING IT BE KNOWN SHE'LL REFUSE TO DO ANY DEAL WITH BORIS JOHNSON IN THIS CAMPAIGN YOU CAN BE CERTAIN AT LEAST OF THIS UNLIKE SOME PREVIOUS WESTMINSTER BATTLES THERE REALLY IS NO CLOSE FRIENDSHIP HERE TO SACRIFICE AT THE ALTAR OF POLITICAL AMBITION
# ROSS HAWKINS REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND OUR SPEAKER THIS MORNING IS NICK BAINES THE ANGLICAN BISHOP OF LEEDS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JOHN HOW LONG THOUGH LORD HOW LONG IS THE THREE THOUSAND YEAR OLD CRY OF A HEBREW POET NOT AN EXPRESSION OF MISERY FROM ENGLAND FOOTBALL FANS IT'S A CRY THAT BURNS IN THE HEART AND SOMETIMES ESCAPES THE LIPS OF THOSE WHO LOOK AT THE WORLD AND WEEP AT YET ANOTHER TRAGEDY ANOTHER OFFENCE
THE HORROR OF ISTANBUL IS JUST THE LATEST IN A LITANY OF HORRORS ON THE EVE OF THE CENTENARY OF THE SLAUGHTER AT THE SOMME WE ENCOUNTER AGAIN THE SORT OF SAVAGERY THAT STRIPS AWAY THE VENEERS OF CIVILISATION THAT WE LONG FOR
AIRPORTS ARE TERRIBLE TARGETS THESE PLACES WERE DIFFERENT WORLDS INTO SECT WERE DIVERSE HUMANITY GLANCES OFF EACH OTHER IN TRANSIT SINCE WE CIRCLE OUR TINY PLANET THEY SHOULD BE PLACES SVEN COUNTER OF SURPRISE AND RECONCILIATION DEPARTURES CRISSCROSSING ARRIVALS THEY ARE PLACES WHERE THE WORLD CONNECTS WE WERE EXPOSED TO THE RICHNESS OF HUMANITY AND CULTURE
SO IT'S NOT ONLY TRAGIC WHEN PEOPLE HATE US ATTACK INNOCENT TRAVELLERS IN THE NAME OF THE VIOLENT IDEOLOGY BUT IT STRIPS OF SABAH LONGING FOR PEACE HOW LONG GO LORD HOW LONG PERHAPS A QUESTION THE LORD OUGHT TO BE ASKING
BUT TALKING OF STRIPPING AWAY THE VENEERS OF NORMALITY OR CIVILISATION WE ARE COMPELLED TO ASK WHERE THE VIOLENCE OF HATRED BEGINS THE LAST WEEK HAS SEEN A MARKED INCREASE IN RACIST INCIDENTS IN HER OWN COUNTRY WITH PEOPLE BEING SHOCKINGLY ABUSED IN PUBLIC AND CARDS BEING SENT TO POLISH CHILDREN TELLING THEM TO GET OUT MAYBE WE ARE GOOD AT KEEPING SUCH SENTIMENTS UNDER THE SURFACE UNTIL THEY'RE GIVEN SANCTIONED BY THE EROSION OF THE SOCIAL INHIBITORS THAT NORMALLY KEEP THEM IN CHECK
BUT JUST AS RACISM BEGINS NOT AS A SCREAMING CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE BUT AS A SEED THAT GETS WATERED BY SILENCE AND BY RUMOUR SODAS ITS ANTIDOTE ONE OF THE STORIES JESUS TOLD US PERTINENT HERE THE PLACE WHERE GOD IS TO BE FOUND IT'S LIKE A MUSTARD SEED TINY EASILY TO TREAD ON
YET WHERE IT TAKES ROOT HIDDEN FROM SIGHT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GROW INTO A TREE WHOSE BRANCHES OFF FOR A PLACE OF REFUGE AND HABITATION FOR THE BIRDS OF THE AIR OF COURSE WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IMAGE IS THAT THE BRANCHES DON'T GET TO BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHICH BIRDS MAKE THEIR NESTS AMONG THEM
THIS IS A PICTURE NOT JUST OF HOSPITALITY BUT OF NURTURE IF RACISM AND VIOLENCE GREW FROM SMALL SEEDS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE ROOT IN THE MINDS AND HEARTS MORE CHILDREN THEN IT'S EQUALLY TRUE THAT THESE WILL BE CHALLENGED NOT BY WISHFUL SILENCE BUT BY THE PLANTAIN WATERING THE NURTURING OF SEEDS THAT GROW HOPE COMMITMENT AND LOVE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO DIG AT THE BAD SEED A GOOD ONE HAS TO BE PLANTED IN ITS PLACE
# AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH NICK BRINGS THE BISHOP OF LEEDS TIME IS NOW TEN TO EIGHT THE NOBEL LAUREATE AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY PROFESSOR SIR PAUL NURSE HAS SAID RESEARCH IN THIS COUNTRY IS FACING ITS BIGGEST THREAT IN LIVING MEMORY U.K. UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH CENTRES RECEIVED BILLIONS FROM THE E.U. AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY RELIES ON FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE A QUARTER OF THE SCIENTIST WORKING AT CAMBRIDGE ARE FROM THE E.U.
THE SCIENCE MINISTER JOE JOHNSON WILL BE SPEAKING TO SCIENTIST TODAY WHO WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW DAMON GLOVER WAS THE FIRST AND LAST SCIENTIFIC ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION SHE'S NOW ABERDEEN ABERDEEN UNIVERSITY AND SHE TOLD ME ABOUT HER FEARS
MY CONCERN WILL BE VERT AND NEGOTIATION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL SOMEHOW AFFECT HER ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS BOTH THE FUNDING STREAM WHICH HAS HER EYES AND TWENTY TWENTY
TO INFLUENCE THE STRATEGY OF WHAT THAT FUNDING US FOCUSED TOWARDS AND WILL LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO GET THE BEST MINDS IN THE WORLD TO COME TO THE U.K. AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY HERE THERE ARE COUNTRIES LIKE TURKEY AND ISRAEL WHO HAVE ACCESS TO A HORIZON TWENTY TWENTY FUNDING AND THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE NEW THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR WHAT THEY GET THEY CANNOT INFLUENCE ANYTHING THAT IS DONE IN HORIZON TWENTY TWENTY SO THEY'RE REALLY POOR RELATIVES
AND THE ARGUMENT IS THAT WHAT AS THINGS STAND WE GET MORE FUNDING OUT OF THE E.U. THAN WE PUT IN SUBSTANTIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO RESEARCH SO IF WE LOOK AT THE LAST FUNDING PROGRAMME WE GOT ABOUT EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION EUROS OUT OF THAT PROGRAMME AND A PROPORTIONAL CONTRIBUTION WAS FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION EUROS IF THERE WAS SOME WAY TO PROTECT THAT BUT TO CHANGE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT SO THAT WE HAVE BETTER CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION WOULD THAT SATISFY SIGNED
NOT REALLY BECAUSE WE WANT FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT WE RELY ON TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE FROM HORIZON TWENTY TWENTY AND THERE'S A PRECEDENT HERE IN SWITZERLAND WAS A FOOL ASSOCIATED COUNTRY OF HORIZON TWENTY TWENTY AS SOON AS THEY VOTED IN A REFERENDUM TO RESTRICT IMMIGRATION IN SWITZERLAND OVERNIGHT
THEY BECAME A NON ASSOCIATED COUNTRY AND COULD NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS O.K. SAY THE WORST HAPPENS AND WE LOSE THESE THINGS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT REALLY MAKE BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY HOLD ON A SECOND YOU'RE DOING THE U.K. DOWN HERE WE HAVE BRILLIANT SCIENTISTS WILL STILL HAVE BRILLIANT SCIENTISTS YEAH YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE STILL WILL BE ABLE TO DO SCIENCE
BUT SCIENCE IS UNUSUAL BECAUSE IT IS TRULY GLOBAL AND SO IF I OR PUBLISH A PAPER BUT JUST WITH OTHER U.K. SCIENTISTS ALL THE EVIDENCE SAYS THAT PAPER IT WILL HAVE LESS IMPACT THAN IF I PUBLISH WITH INTERNATIONAL CO AUTHORS DO YOU ABSOLUTELY MADE THE POINT SCIENCES GLOBAL SCIENCE WILL STILL BE GLOBAL IF WE'RE OUT OF THE E.U. AND WE CAN STILL WORK WITH EUROPEAN PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE WORLD SURELY
BUT WE HAVE TO FIND THE FUNDING MECHANISM TO ALLOW US TO DO THAT WE HAVE A PERFECT SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT AND THAT'S GOING TO BE
UNDERMINED OR DENIED TO US AS PART OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ON THAT COSTING HOW MUCH WITH THE U.K. GOVERNMENT NEED TO PUT IN TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS I THINK THAT U.K. GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO FUND U.K. SCIENCE JUST SHY OF AN EXTRA ONE BILLION POUNDS PER ANNUM
WE COULD PROVIDE THAT FUNDING BUT WE STILL WOULDN'T HAVE THEIR MINDS SO THAT WON'T BE ADDRESSED JUST BY U.K. GOVERNMENT PUTTING IN A LOT OF FUNDING
DAMON GLOVER TALKING TO ME EARLIER WELL HERE IN THE STUDIOS PROFESSOR ANGUS DALGLEISH IS A SPOKESMAN FOR SCIENTISTS FOR BRITAIN AND CAMPAIGNED FOR BRECK'S IT GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TO YOU EXCEPT THESE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE DAMAGE THAT WILL BE DONE TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BY REMOVING FREE MOVEMENT AND LIMITING THE FUNDING NO I DON'T I THINK IT'S RATHER HYSTERICAL ACTUALLY BECAUSE SCIENCE SCIENTISTS RATHER LIKE FISH THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE THE WATERS ARE TERRITORIAL BOUNDARIES ACCEPTS
I REALLY DON'T THINK IT WAS THEY INTERFERE WITH THE COLLABORATION THAT WE'VE ALL HE'S DONE WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE FUNDING WHICH IS THE MONEY THAT WE PAY IN AND GET OUT AND IT'S VERY FOCUSED ON THAT MAT SUM OF MONEY WHICH WAS MENTIONED THERE WHICH IS FOR THE PEER REVIEWED HUNDING
IF SHE DIDN'T MENTION THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LARGE STRUCTURAL FUND THERE TOO WHICH WE PAY A FORTUNE INTO AND GET VERY LITTLE OUT AND THE SCIENTISTS FORMER E.U. FREELY ADMIT HAD AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF THAT MONEY CANNOT BE TRACED IT JUST GOES ON A CORRUPTION AND WAIST WHICH I THINK HAD LARGELY DEFINES STRUCTURAL FUNDING HOW MUCH WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S OF SORT OF WHAT SIZE IS IT AND WHAT'S IT FOR SIZE SIZES ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN BILLION
AND WE GET LESS THAN TWO BILLION OUT OF IT HOW MUCH DO WE PUT INTO IT ABOUT EIGHT BILLION FAR AS I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A NET GAIN OF SIX BILLION THAT WE COULD GET FROM THAT WHICH WE COULD SPEND
ON ON ACROSS THE BOARD YES I DO AND THAT'S THAT'S JUST PART OF THE BUDGET THERE GOES ON SCIENTIFIC RELATED ISSUES THERE'S ALL THE OTHER PARTNERSHIPS MONEY THAT WE PUT IN THERE WE DON'T GET BACK AND YOU QUITE RIGHTLY SAY A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMMES ABOUT BEING IN THE E.U. AND REALLY CAN YOU TELL ME THAT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE TOP TEN UNIVERSITIES FOR THE TOP EIGHT ARE YOU KAY
ONE OF THEM IN SWITZERLAND NOT IN THE IN THE CUP PENNY QUITE ABOUT SWITZERLAND WHICH IS THAT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY VOTED TO RESTRICT IMMIGRATION OVERNIGHT THEY WERE EFFECTIVELY EXCLUDED FROM THIS FUND WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WE'RE NOT SWITZERLAND WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST TRADING ORGANISATION IN THE WORLD WE ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC VOICE IN THE WORLD WE HAD MORE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS
EXCEPT RENEE IMPACT THAN THE REST OF EUROPE SO I DON'T SEE WHY WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A VOICE IF WE JUST PARTICIPATE AS WE'RE DOING AND I DON'T SEE ANY I MEAN YOU'RE GOOD IT'S NOT THERE THERE'S THE FUNDING THERE IS ALSO THIS QUESTION OF FREE MOVEMENT YOU HAVE SIR PROFESSOR SIR PAUL NURSE OR LET NO BELLA YOU HAVE MAJORITY PROBABLY OF SENIOR SCIENTISTS IN THIS COUNTRY ALL THE UNIVERSITIES SAYING THIS WOULD BE BAD IF NOT JUST FOR THE FUNDING BUT ALSO FOR THE FREE MOOD MOVEMENT THAT ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO COME AND WORK HERE
THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO COME AND WORK HERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIS FREEDOM OF LABOUR AS OPPOSED TO FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND IF WE DON'T WE WILL NOT HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON PEOPLE TO COME HERE
FOR JOBS AND FOR BASICALLY WHAT I WHY NOT WHY SO WHY ARE THERE RULES ABOUT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT NOT GOING TO APPLY TO SCIENTISTS HAVE THEY APPLY TO EVERYBODY ELSE BUT THEY ARE GOING TO END UP GOING TO APPLY THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S GOING TO BE THRASHED OUT IN THEIR OR NOT THEY'VE APPLIED TO PEOPLE WHO YOU REALLY NEED YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM THE E.U. COMING TO BE DOCTORS OR NURSES EXCEPT FOR HERE WHEN THERE'S A JOB TO GO TO YOU THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE I MEAN HALF THE PEOPLE WHO COME HERE AREN'T EVEN IN THE Y. YOU THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE IF THEY NEEDED SO I THINK THAT
THERE'S BEEN A BIG CONFUSION ABOUT MOVEMENT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR SO COME OUT SO ON THE NUMBERS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY LOOK THE NUMBERS HAVE TO COME DOWN YOU WOULD SAY FROM WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THE NUMBERS DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO COME DOWN IT'S JUST WHO WE GET IN THERE IT'S THAT WE'VE ALWAYS SUGGESTED THAT ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS APPOINT A STYLE SYSTEM LIKE THEY HAVE IN AUSTRALIA AND THEN PEOPLE COME EASILY BACK AND SAY OH YES BUT THAT'S TO INCREASE IMMIGRATION FOR THE SAME THING CAN BE USED ARE HERE TO DECIDE
AT THE QUALITY OF PEOPLE WHO YOU HAVE COME IN AND I THINK THAT THIS IDEA THAT WE HAVE IT WE WE WON'T GET THE BEST BRAINS HAVE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION IS CLEARLY NOT TRYING I CAN THINK OF HALF A DOZEN REALLY TOP PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE FROM AUSTRALIA OR NEW ZEALAND THEY'RE NOT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SO I DID NOT THINK THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE REALLY HIGH CALIBRE IT'S GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO AT ALL PROFESSOR ANGUS DALGLEISH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST PETER NICE JOHN SCORCH ON THE WAY COOL BREEZY SHOWERY THEMES FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK BUT ACTUALLY ACROSS MUCH OF ENGLAND AND WALES TODAY THERE WILL BE QUITE A BIT OF DRY WEATHER SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE AT THE MOMENT FOR MANY PLACES AS WELL BUT IT WILL TEND TO CLOUD OVER I THINK AS THE DAY WEARS ON ONE OR TWO SHARP SHOWERS POPPING UP ACROSS SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THIS AFTERNOON ONCE THE EARLY MORNING RAIN IS CLEARED AWAY EASTERN ENGLAND COULD SEE ONE OR TWO OF THOSE AS WELL AND THEN LATER ON ITS WESTERN START TO SEE SOME MORE PERSISTENT RAIN BY THIS EVENING

THE REPORT SAYS THAT OUTCOMES OF TREATMENT WERE BROADLY COMPARABLE TO OTHER CENTRES THE REPORT MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE TRUST RUNNING THE HOSPITAL AND CALLS FOR A NATIONAL REVIEW OF PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE SERVICES AS THE AUTHOR ELEANOR GRAY Q.C. EXPLAINS
WE SAW A LOT OF EVIDENCE OF PRESSURES ON FAMILIES BECAUSE OF CANCELLATION OF OPERATIONS AND WE THINK THAT THOSE SORT OF PRECIOUS REALLY ONLY INCREASING AND IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT THAT NOT JUST IN BRISTOL BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND H.

THEY ARE BOTH AS WE SPEAK MAINTAINING A DISCREET SILENCE BUT I'M JOINED BY TWO I SUPPOSE I COULD CALL THEM PROXIES IN A AWAY ONE FOR EACH OF THEM DAMIAN GREEN WHO IS THERESA MAY'S CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN FORMER HOME OFFICE MINISTER HIMSELF OF COURSE AND NADINE'S I'LL BE CONSERVATIVE M.P. ALSO A MEMBER OF BORIS JOHNSON'S CAMPAIGN LET ME BEGIN WITH YOU DAMIEN GREEN AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU BOTH THIS SAME QUESTION WHAT IS
THE PROPOSAL USED ALL THE IDEAL MODEL OF A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEW EUROPEAN UNION AFTER WE HAVE SIGNED UP TO ARTICLE FIVE AND ALL THE REST OF IT ARE WE GOING TO SAY WE INSIST ON BEING IN THE SINGLE MARKET AND WE INSIST ON THERE BEING NO MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE HE'S NOT UNDER THE SAME PROPOSAL OF THE SAME PLANS WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT WHAT WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE HOW MANY HOURS IF YOU'VE GOT WOOD YOU'VE GOT ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS O.K. THE THE THE IDEAL IS HE'S THE ONE THAT GIVES US
THE MOST ABILITY TO TRADE WITH THE SINGLE MARKET IN BOTH GOODS AND SERVICES SERVICES ARE HUGELY IMPORTANT WHAT'S THAT I'M GOING TO RATHER THAN THE IDEAL BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE IDEAL IS BUT WHAT IS THE MINIMUM YOU'D ACCEPT YOUR CANDIDATE THERESA THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A SPECTRUM WHERE AS IT WERE THE STATUS QUO SHE'S JUST BEEN REJECTED BY THE BRITISH PEOPLE SO WE CAN'T HAVE THAT COS THEY CLEARLY WANT MORE CONTROL OVER
WHAT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT TO IT SO WE CAN'T HAVE THAT AND AT THE OTHER END IS NOT BEING IN THE SINGLE MARKET NOT BEING ABLE TO TRADE IN GOODS AND SERVICES AND BOTH OF THOSE THOSE ENDS ARE UNDESIRABLE SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS NEGOTIATE THE DEAL GIVES US THE BEST ABILITY
TO TRADE GOODS AND SERVICES BUT ALSO GIVES US A MUCH MORE CONTROL OVER THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING IN WHERE WE LAND ON THAT SPECTRUM IS CLEARLY WHAT THE FOCUS OF THE NEGOTIATE WELL INDEED BUT BUT YOU GO INTO THE NEGOTIATIONS OBVIOUSLY WITH A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM BUT THERE WOULD BE AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED MISSUS MAY WOULD AS PRIME MINISTER
NEGOTIATE ON THE QUESTION OF FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE SHE WOULD NOT BE SAYING TO THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN COUNTRIES SORRY THEY CAN'T COME HERE ANY LONGER THAT'S PUTTING IT PATERNITY RUDELY BUT NONETHELESS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YEAH BUT CLEARLY IT'S THE OTHER WAY ROUND REALLY THAT WHAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE SAID IS THAT THE FREE MOVEMENT OF THEY WANTED HAS NOT PASSED IS UNACCEPTABLE SO THEREFORE WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE A NEW ARRANGEMENT
CLEARLY WE CAN'T DO THE THE DETAILS OF THAT BEFORE THE NEGOTIATIONS START AND INDEED IT'S CLEAR THIS MORNING WE'VE HAD SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT RESPONSES FROM A FRENCH MINISTER AND A SENIOR GERMAN MINISTERS TO WHAT'S ACCEPTABLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SNOOKER THREE MOVEMENTS NOT ON THE TIP IT WAS WHAT THE GERMANS WERE AND BUT THE FRENCH SAID IT IS ON THE TABLE SO WE WILL BE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEGOTIATING POSITION AT THE OTHER SIDE IT'S YET UNDERSTANDABLY SO I THINK THAT THE
YEAH THEY WILL CLEARLY BE SOMEWHERE ON THAT SPECTRUM AS THEY SAY IT IS VITAL OBVIOUSLY FOR A FUTURE ECONOMIC AND HER WEAKNESS IS PROBABLY THIS ISN'T IT IMMIGRATION ONE OF THE WEAKNESSES POPHAM HAVE MANY STRENGTHS OF COURSE BUT HER WEAKNESS IS THAT SHE HAS BEEN HOME OFFICE MINISTER TO SECRETARY FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND IF YOU READ A LONG TIME
AND DURING THAT TIME WE HAVE SEEN IMMIGRATION RISE WE'LL IT'S OF A THIRD OF A MILLION NET IMMIGRATION AS WE SPEAK AND THAT ISN'T WHAT WAS PROMISED AND SHE WAS IN CHARGE DURING THAT PERIOD SHE SHE'S BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL HOME SECRETARY ANYONE CAN REMEMBER AND HAS HAS GOT NOT WE'RE IMMIGRATION EACH STATEMENT IMMIGRATION SHIT SHE HAS DONE MORE TO BRING IT DOWN TO ABOLISH THINGS LIKE POKERS COLLEGES AND ONE OF NONETHELESS THE BOTTOM LINE
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM HAS INDEED BEEN THE AMOUNT OF IMMIGRATION FROM THE E.U. AND THAT'S NOW WHAT'S ON THE TABLE THERE ARE MANY THINGS
THAT THAT HAVE BEEN TURNED THINGS LIKE PEOPLE DON'T CONDUCT SHAM MARRIAGES WITH BRITISH PIERRE URBAN CLOSE DETAILS THEY MADE A PLEDGE TO TENS OF THOUSANDS NO IFS NO BUTS AND WE'RE NOT TALKING OF TENS OF THOUSANDS WERE TALKING ABOUT A THIRD OF A MILLION PEOPLE THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE AND HE DID THE WERE TWO KEY PRINCIPLES HERE ONE IS THAT YOU WANT TO BRING IN
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE USEFUL ARMOUR AND THEN WE'LL COME OUT AND WE WANT TO DO THAT AT THE SAINT I DON'T I JUST WANTED TO CLOSE THE BORDERS BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT WHO ARE JUST COMING HERE TO TO CLAIM BENEFITS OR SO ON AND WE HAVE BEEN
MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL AT THAT THE MOST COUNTRIES THE OTHER THE OTHER KEY OUT IT'S NOT A PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE THE BRITISH ECONOMY HAS BEEN A JOB CREATING MACHINE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN PARTICULAR HAVEN'T GOT THAT STRIKING THAT BALANCE IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT ALL RIGHT BUT BUT NOPE NOBODY COULD'VE BEEN TOUGHER NOBODY COULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONSISTENT THING HAVE SOME SORT OF WIND MIGHT NOT BE IN THIS SITUATION MIGHT WE HAD THAT SHE MISSES ME
PLAYED A RATHER MORE UPFRONT PART IN THE CAMPAIGN SHE WAS SHE WAS ALMOST INVISIBLE WASN'T SHE WINCED WE KNEW THAT SHE'D BEEN FAIRLY SCEPTICAL INDEED QUITE PROFOUNDLY SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION SHE DID CAMPAIGN FOR REMAIN BUT ONLY JUST AND IT'S POSSIBLE
BUT IF SHE'D BEEN OUT THERE LIKE BORIS JOHNSON BARNSTORMING AROUND THE PLACE MAYBE SHE COULD HAVE SWUNG QUITE A FEW VOTES I THINK THE THE BARNSTORMING AROUND THE PLACE AS YOU PUT IT WAS WAS CLEARLY LESS THAN BY THE PRIME MINISTER IS THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER AND SHE WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED A DIFFERENCE ACTUALLY HANDS AND CHI CHI MADE HER VIEWS CLEAR SHE MADE
A VERY THOUGHTFUL SPEECH AND BUT THAT'S THE POINT YOU MADE A VERY WEAK SHE WASN'T OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING WASN'T SHE WAS IT WHAT'S THAT WHAT WE WE'RE DISCUSSING HOW IS THE IS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT THE FACT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER STOOD DOWN AND WHAT WE BOTH THE DEMONISE HIM PEAS AND THEN MEMBERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT IS WHO IS THE BEST PRIME MINISTER WHO'S GOING TO BE THE BEST PRIME MINISTER TO TAKE ON
A ONE NATION INCLUSIVE AGENDA TO MAKE US AS TERESA'S GOING TO SAY THIS MORNING A COUNTRY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE AND A FORM OF CONSERVATISM THAT DOES MAKE CLEAR THAT WE'VE GOT BIG PROBLEMS IN A COUNTRY THAT MAKES CLEAR THAT CONSERVATISM IS NOT JUST ABOUT INDIVIDUALISM IT IS ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONS WE WANT TO DEFEND ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE
WHO FEEL THEY'VE BEEN FAILED BY THE SYSTEM WHICH WAS A LOT OF THE REASON I THINK PEOPLE VOTED TO LEAVE IS WHAT WE NEED CAN WRITE WITH WHAT AS WHAT AS YOU SAY IS EVERYONE KNOWS SHE'S TOUGH SHE'S CONSISTENT WHEN SHE SAYS SOMETHING TODAY SHE STILL GOING TO MEAN IT TOMORROW AND SHE GETS HER WAY SHE GOT ABU QATADA OUT OF THE COUNTRY SHE KEPT GARY MCKINNON IN THE COUNTRY ALL RIGHT SHE HAS MANY SUCCESSES O.K. THANKS FOR THAT DAMIEN GREEN SIMILAR QUESTION DUE TO START WITH AND THAT IS FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE
WHERE SLIGHTLY CONFUSED AREN'T WE AS TO WHERE BORIS JOHNSON STANDS BECAUSE HE SAID BACK IN FEBRUARY THE SINGLE MARKET IS OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE HE SAID TO ANDREW MARR
EARLIER THIS MONTH THAT WE WON'T WHEN YOU ANDREW ASKED HIM WON'T WE WE WON'T BE IN THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET HE SAID ABSOLUTELY HE WROTE AFTER THE REFERENDUM BRITISH PEOPLE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO GO ON TO WORK IN THE E.U. TO LIFT TO TROUBLE STUDIED BY HOLMES SETTLE DOWN AS THE GERMAN EQUIVALENT OF THE C.B.I. HAS VERY SET TO REMIND US THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE FREE TRADE AND ACCESS TO THE SUPERMARKET WHERE ON EARTH DOES HE STAND ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE WELL
WE HAVE TO DELIVER FOR SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE VOTED TO LEAVE I THINK THE PUMPS IT WAS RIGHT TO SAY IN HIS RESIGNATION SPEECH AS ALSO WHEN HE DID THE ROUNDS OF THE STUDIO THAT HOOO BECAUSE PRIME MINISTERS TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT NEW AGENDA DELIVERING I'M GOING I'M GOING I'M GOING I'M GOING TO COME ALL RIGHT
THIS YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T A TRADE OFF JOHN IT'S NOT A TRADE OFF BETWEEN CONTROLLING OUR BORDERS AND STOPPING FREE MEAT FREE MOVEMENT HAVING AN AUSTRALIAN STYLE POINTS SYSTEM AND TRADING WITH EUROPE STILL TRAPPED ANYWAY EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR ECONOMY TO SERVICES WE'VE NEVER HAD A SINGLE MARKET IN SERVICES IN EUROPE BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE SINGLE MARKET IT IS IMPORTANT THE FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER
SIMON FRASER HEAD AND I'M NOT SORRY WHAT IS HIS POSITION BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR POSITION HE SAYS IT IS COUGH OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE THEREFORE IS IT OF SUCH VALUE THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO ALLOW E.U. CITIZENS TO COME AND LIVE AND WORK IN THIS COUNTRY SIMPLE QUESTION WELL THE SIMPLE ANSWER TO THAT
AND BORIS WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS IS WE HAVE TO HAVE AN AUSTRALIAN BASED POINTS SYSTEMS OR STRAIGHT MISSED A BIT THAT POINTS SYSTEM WHERE WE CONTROL OUR BORDERS CONTROL OF OUR ECONOMY AND WE STILL CAN GET ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET YOU'VE HEARD THE FRENCH FINANCE WAS SIMON FRASER WHO LED THE FOREIGN OFFICE CAME TO MY COME ON THE FRONT A FAIR SELECTION WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OF THIS
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A TRAIT OF THERE COULD BE A BRITISH MODEL WHERE WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND CONTROL OUR BORDERS OR STOP FREEMAN AND IF WE DON'T GET THAT WE BE IDLE SINGLE NO THAT'S MY POINT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A TRADE OFF YOU CAN NEGOTIATE ON BOTH SIDES AND WE'RE HEARING NOISES FROM EUROPE FROM EXPERTS THAT SAY YOU CAN YOU ARE YOU HEARD WHAT THE RIGHT HAND MAN TO ANGELA MERKEL SAID AN HOUR AGO ON THIS PROGRAMME AND HE DIDN'T
AND THEN I HEARD THE FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER AND THE FINNISH DEPUTY PRIME TO SAY THERE THAT THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR THE YOU ALL RIGHT HAVING ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET THE POINT BEING HERE IS BORIS IS GOING TO DELIVER A POSITIVE MESSAGE A MESSAGE THAT IS ABOUT US BELIEVING OURSELVES BELIEVING IN A VALUABLE COUNTRY HE HASN'T CAMPAIGNED WITH HIM THROUGH THIS PERIOD WITH MICHAEL THEY BOTH ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE
PASSIONATE ABOUT THOSE FAMILIES ON NATIONAL WAGE WHO GET HURT BY FREEMAN TELL YOU WHAT ALL WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT HIM ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON SINCE THE CAMPAIGN ENDED AND WE VOTED FOR ABRAXAS WE KNOW THAT HE'S PRETTY PASSIONATE ABOUT CRICKET COS HE WENT OFF PLAYING CRICKET AT THE WEEKEND HE DIDN'T BOTHER GOING INTO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO HEAR DAVID CAMERON DIDN'T BOTHER GOING AT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS FOR P.M.Q.S YESTERDAY HASN'T SAID VERY MUCH AT ALL AND THAT WHICH HE HAS SAID HE'S SLIGHTLY RESULT FROM I THINK YOU SEE A SERIOUS FIGURE
THE VERY SERIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT THE BUSINESS MY IN NICK BOLES WHO'S A REMAIN WHO CAME ON SIDE NICK GIBBS OF THE EDUCATION WHICH HAS COME ON SO HE'S BRINGING THE HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HIS GAVEL JONTY'S DORJI BE OPENED THIS WEEK THE CHIEF WHIP ASKED FOR TWIGS MEMBERS TO MEET TOGETHER TO UNITE THE PARTY HE TURNED UP
IT WAS A NO SHOW SO HE IS ABOUT UNITING THE PARTY UNITING THE COUNTRY HE'S A WIN THERE IN FRONT OF US A LABOUR CITY YES ONE TWICE UP AND SAID SO DURING THE LUST YOU WILL HEAR IN THIS MORNING WE WILL TO THAT YOU WILL HEAR A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND POSITIVITY AND THEIR MESSAGE ABOUT BRINGING THE COUNTRY TO GET LONDON BY EVERY POLLSTERS DEFINITION IS A LABOUR CITY HE'S WON TWICE
HE DELIVERED AT THEIR MOST SUCCESSFUL OLYMPICS HE SAT ON A COBRA A SEVENTEEN BILLION POUND BUDGET FOR LONDON HE FACED AN IAN BLAIR WHEN HE FELT THE MET WASN'T FIT FOR PURPOSE THIS IS A MAN WHO MAKES DECISIONS AND BRINGS THE PARTY TO GO AND WREAK DRINKS IN THE BAR AS LONG AS YOU'LL SEE TODAY THEY PIECE TOGETHER WHO WILL SEE REMAIN ARE STANDING NEXT TO A BURST OF SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WE NEED THE BEST TEAM TO NEGOTIATE A NEW
BUT SETTLEMENT WITH EUROPE AND BORIS WILL DELIVER THAT AND HE WILL HAVE THAT PASSION THAT THEY WERE ABOUT ABOUT DELIVERY FOR SEVENTY MILLION PEOPLE WHO VOTED TO LEE FINAL FINAL QUICK THOUGHT IN IT'S ONE ABOUT
OR MICHAEL GUV'S WIFE AND THE INFAMOUS NOW PRIVATE EMAIL THAT SHE SENT IN WHICH HE MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT SHE AT LEAST THERE SEEM TO BE THE MESSAGE OF IT SHE DOESN'T TRUST BORIS JOHNSON HERSELF SHE WANTED SPECIFIC GUARANTEE IS NOW THIS IS MICHAEL GOES WIFE SHE WANTED SPECIFIC GUARANTEES ON IMMIGRATION CONTROLS ET-CETERA ET-CETERA IN OTHER WORDS DON'T TRUST HIM
OR AT LEAST THAT WASN'T HER SPECIFIC LANGUAGE FOR THAT PERSISTENT TO CLEAR IMPORT WASN'T IT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH BOTH MICHAEL AND BORIS SARAH VINE IS MARRIED TO MICHAEL WIVES HAVE ALL SORTS OF PIECE OF ADVICE FOR THE HUSBAND AS MY WIFE DOES
BUT MICHAEL HAS MADE HIS DECISION AND YOU WILL SEE AND WORK AS HE DID FOR THE CAMPING HAND GLOVE WITH BORIS BE PASSIONATE ABOUT DELIVERING FOR BOTH THE SEVENTEEN MILLION HOOVERED OUT BUT THE FORTY EIGHT PER CENT WHO HAD TO REMAIN THE WAY WE DO THAT IS A POSITIVE MESSAGE THAT WE WORK TOGETHER ALL THE TALENTS GET A NEW SETTLEMENT WITH EUROPE AND PROTECT THOSE ON NATIONAL LIVING WAIT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE WORKING CLASS FAMILIES IN THE COUNTRY NOW EMIGRANTS THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT
# ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMEMORATIONS OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR FALLS TOMORROW WHEN WILL MARK THE START OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME ON THE FIRST JULY NINETEEN SIXTEEN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO JIM KNOCKED HE WILL BE THERE FOR US ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND HE'S BEEN TALKING TO THE CHORISTERS OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY WHO'LL BE SINGING AT THE START OF AN ALL NIGHT VIGIL THIS EVENING IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT THE ABBEY'S BEEN OPEN IN THIS WAY FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS SINCE THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO
THE QUEEN IS GOING TO BE AT THE START OF THE VIGIL TONIGHT AT THE PLACE WHERE THE GRAVE OF THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR BROUGHT FROM THE BATTLEFIELDS AND WHOSE NAME IS KNOWN TO NO ONE IS IN THE ABBEY KNAVE NEAR THE GREAT WEST DOOR I WENT TO HEAR THE BOY CHORISTERS REHEARSING A POWERFUL SERVICE SINGING AN ANTHEM BY THE CONTEMPORARY COMPOSER JUDITH BINGHAM THAT USES SOME WORDS FROM THE WAR POET WILFRED OWEN WHO DIED IN FRANCE A WEEK BEFORE THE ARMISTICE IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
IT'S NOT REALLY BETWEEN THE TWO MEMORIES JUST DO IT TO HIM O.K. IN THE FIRST WAR
AND WITH JAMES O'DONNELL ORGANIST AND MASTER OF CHORISTERS NOW TELL US HOW THIS SERVICE WAS CONCEIVED HOW DOES PUT TOGETHER AND WHAT IT'S SAYING ONE OF THE MANY PRIVILEGES OF WORKING HERE IS THAT FROM TIME TO TIME THERE IS A THERE'S A NATIONAL MOMENT
WHERE ACTUALLY IT FEELS RIGHT FOR THAT TO TAKE PLACE HERE AND THEN THERE'S THE THE GREAT CHALLENGE OF ACTUALLY WORKING OUT HOW TO EXPRESS THAT MOMENT IN THEIR TERMS AND IN MY CASE OBVIOUSLY MY CONCERN IS MUSICALLY AND HOW THOSE TWO THINGS FIT TOGETHER AND HOW THEY HOW THEY CAN HAVE A WIDER RESONANCE THAT WILL SPEAK VERY POWERFULLY TO PEOPLE AS THE NIGHT LONG VIGIL BEGINS
THEY'LL BE SINGING RALPH VAUGHAN WILLIAMS IS SONG OF PAINFUL LONGING THE
LET'S HAVE A WORD WITH A COUPLE OF THE BOTTOM SHALL WE AND YOU
I'M TWELVE AND THIS VISUAL TOUCHES ON EVENTS THAT HAPPENED ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO FATHER BEFORE YOU
THOUGHT OFF WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU I THINK WAS THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR IN THE ABBEY IT'S GOT A VERY DIRECT MEANING WITH STRAW OCCUPATION BECAUSE YOU SEE THE ABBEY EVERY DAY YEAH
IN EVERY SERVICE WE DO THE WHOLE POINT IS TO BRING YOU BACK TO THAT TIME I THINK DIFFERENT THE TUDORS BINGHAM
HERE'S AN ASPECT OF THE FEEL
IT'S NOT A VERY SORT OF IT'S NOT YOUR CLASSIC PIECE THAT WE DO BUT IT IT'S SOMEHOW SEEMS CLOSER TO REAL EXPERIENCE YEAH THE SORT OF THE RICHARD REITERATING OF MADNESS
JUST THE
FIFTY EIGHT NO HOLE ONTO IT A BIT MORE
IT'S SORT OF MAD AND
THERE'S A SORT OF IDEA IN IT IT'S ILLUSTRATING A PICTURE WHICH
WHICH IS NEEDING BETCHA
IT'S ALL ABOUT TALKING ABOUT IT HAVE A LOLLY IS HERE IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER
WHAT THOSE PEOPLE WENT THROUGH ALL AROUND THE ABBEY THERE ARE MONUMENTS TO PEOPLE WHO DIED IN THE HALL FOR THE VIGIL SERVICE FOR THE FOR THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME IT IS GOING TO BE LESS THAN THIRTY MINUTES AND SO ABSOLUTELY EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF IT HAS TO BE PACKED WITH MEANING
OH

TWO TONIGHT AT HALF PAST SEVEN AND TOMORROW I'LL BE AT VAL ON THE SOMME BATTLEFIELD FOR THE START OF THE COMMEMORATION THERE WHERE IT JUST BEFORE HALF PAST SEVEN NOW TIME THERE WILL BE TWO MINUTES SILENCE TO MARK THE MOMENT WHEN ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE BATTLES OF THE GREAT WAR

# YOU ARE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TONIGHT LET'S HAVE SOME OF THE NEWS FROM CHRIS ALDRIDGE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY HAS ENTERED THE RACE TO SUCCEED DAVID CAMERON SAYING THE COUNTRY NEED STRONG PROVEN LEADERSHIP TO NEGOTIATE THE BEST POSSIBLE TERMS FOR LEAVING THE E.U. THE FORMER MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON WILL JOIN THE CONTEST'S THIS MORNING HIS AIDES SAY HE'LL SET OUT A POSITIVE VISION FOR BRITAIN OUTSIDE THE
THE FOREMOST SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY ANGELA EAGLE WILL LAUNCH HER CHALLENGE THIS AFTERNOON TO REPLACE JEREMY CORBIN IS THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY HE'S LOST THE SUPPORT OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF LABOUR M.P.S BUT INSISTED LAST NIGHT HE HAD A MANDATE FROM HIS ELECTION LAST YEAR AND WOULD BE CARRYING ON
# A MAJOR BANK IN SINGAPORE HAS SUSPENDED LOANS TO INVESTORS BUYING PROPERTIES IN LONDON BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES AFTER THE BRECHT'S IT VOTE UNITED OVERSEAS BANK SAID IT WANTED TO ENSURE ITS CUSTOMERS WERE CAUTIOUS WITH THEIR INVESTMENTS
# AN INVESTIGATION INTO A SPECIALIST CHILDREN'S CARDIAC UNIT HAS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF SHORTCOMINGS INCLUDING UNDERSTAFFING IN THE LACK OF APPROPRIATE NURSING SKILLS TO REPORT SAID PATIENTS AT BRISTOL ROYAL HOSPITAL FOR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN PUT AT RISK OF HARM BUT OUTCOMES OF TREATMENT HAD BEEN NO WORSE THAN AT OTHER SUCH CENTRES
# CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE BEFORE THE REFERENDUM WE TRIED TO ANSWER SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND CUT THROUGH THE THICKET OF CLAIMS AND COUNTER CLAIMS BY ASSEMBLING A PANEL OF B.B.C. EDITORS WILL BE DOING THE SAME AGAIN THIS MORNING AND OF COURSE ITS PARTICULAR QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT BRETT'S IT COULD MEAN AND WE HELD THE SAME INSTRUCTIONS AS EVER BREVITY BECAUSE WITH US A PUPIL WHO KNOW AN AWFUL LOT
KATYA ADLER A EUROPE EDITOR NORTHERN SMITH A PERSISTENT POLITICAL EDITOR MARK EASTERN A HOME EDITOR SIMON JACK A BUSINESS EDITOR WHAT THEY KNOW COULD FILL THE NEXT EIGHT HOURS WE WANT TO ASK YOU SPECIFICALLY THOUGH THESE QUESTIONS MARK LET'S START OFF WITH YOU PETER GILBERT WANTS TO KNOW WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO RETAIN Y. YOU CITIZENSHIP
AFTER THE U.K. LEAVES O.K. WELL U.K. CITIZENSHIP DOESN'T EXIST IN ITSELF OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BE A CITIZEN OF A COUNTRY THAT'S A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THAT WOULD THEN BRING YOU ALL THE RIGHTS AND ENTITLEMENTS OF BEING A MEMBER THE RULES FITTED CITIZENSHIP THOUGH VARY HUGELY ANCESTRY CAN BE HELPFUL IF YOU'VE GOT AN ITALIAN GRANDFATHER BURIED SOMEWHERE OR A GERMAN MOTHER THAT COULD BE JOLLY USEFUL THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT ACROSS THE CROSS THE UNION BUS
DISSENT MARRIAGE OR THROUGH NATURALISATION THESE ARE ALL POSSIBLE ROUTES TO CITIZENSHIP IN IRELAND FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE BORN IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO HAVING BEEN BORN IN THE SOUTH SO THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR FOR THOSE WITHOUT A HELPFUL RELATIVE OR HELPFUL BIRTHPLACE ESTABLISHING RESIDENCY IN YOUR CHOSEN COUNTRY IS USUALLY A PREREQUISITE YOU HAVE TO LIVE THERE BUT THAT MAY WELL BECOME A LOT MORE DIFFICULT OF COURSE ONCE WE LEAVE THE E.U. FORMALLY
MARRYING AND HE USED TO DISTANT OR GETTING A JOB MIGHT HELP BUT AGAIN THERE ARE RULES AS THERE ARE IN THE U.K. FOR NON E.U. CITIZENS AND RESIDENCY DOESN'T LEAD AUTOMATICALLY TO CITIZENSHIP TO OUTSIDE U.K. SYSTEMS WILL BE TREATED EXACTLY THE SAME AS AMERICANS INDIANS NORTH KOREANS AND EVERYONE ELSE
# BILL WANTS TO KNOW A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION WHAT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT AND IN WHAT ORDER AND JOIN THAT UP WITH SHAUN SINCLAIR WHO SAYS WE WILL STILL MAKE PAYMENTS TO AND UP PULLS THE RULES OF THE E.U. UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE ACTUALLY LEAVE SO IT MAY NOW FEEL THESE UM NEXT EIGHT HOURS AS HIS
SO IF YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THE ATTITUDE IN THE REST OF THE E.U. THEY FEEL THAT THE U.K. VOTED OUT AND WE NOW WANT TO GET ON WITH IT BUT FRUSTRATINGLY FOR THEM UNDER E.U. RULES THE BALL IS NOW FIRMLY IN BRITAIN HAS CAUGHT THE U.K. HAS TO FORMALLY NOTIFY THE E.U. THAT IT WANTS TO LEAVE AND ONLY THEN THAT CANTOR FOR DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS START TO THAT MEANS UNTANGLING THE U.K. FROM EVERYTHING YOU AND THAT WILL BE HUGELY COMPLEX AND ALSO STARTING NEW TRADE NEGOTIATIONS
THIS FORMAL NOTIFICATION PROCESS IS CALLED INVOKING ARTICLE FIFTY OF THE LISBON TREATY BRITAIN WOULD LIKE TO HOLD OFF INVOKING ARTICLE FIFTY TO LET KNOWS WHAT HER FUTURE DEAL WITH THAT YOU COULD LOOK LIKE AND THE E.U. WANTS THE OPPOSITE SO IT'S REFUSING TO TALK UNTIL FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS START NOW IN THEORY UNTIL AT LEAST TWO YEARS INTO ONGOING FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS WE REMAIN FULL MEMBERS OF THE E.U. WITH ALL RIGHTS LIKE FULL AXIS OF THE SINGLE MARKET UNTIL COMMITMENTS SO THAT MEANS HAVING TO CONTINUE TO PAY INTO THE E.U. BUDGET
AND EXCEPT E.U. MIGRATION BUT THIS SUPPOSES NO UNILATERAL ACTUALLY SO FOR EXAMPLE IF DAVID CAMERON SUCCESSOR DECIDES TO IGNORE RULINGS FROM THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE OR BLOCK ACCESS TO A LABOUR MARKET FOR E.U. MIGRANTS THEN RULES ARE OUT THE GLOVES ARE OFF AND THINGS COULD GET MESSY O.K. WELL GIVEN THAT COMPLEXITY THE QUESTION FOR YOU NORMAN COMES FROM NICK GILLIBRAND WHICH IS
# WILL THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER HAVE THE TIME TO SORT OUT BOTH THE ISSUE OF BRECHT'S IT AND MANAGE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS QUITE POSSIBLY NOT NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE SORT OF HUGE POLITICAL IN TRACKED ABILITY OF WITHDRAWING FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT HAVE YOU LISTENED TO SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS THEY ARE ALREADY WARNING OFF POTENTIAL QUOTES GOVERNMENT GRIDLOCK BECAUSE
THE CIVIL SERVANTS WILL BE GRAPPLING WITH CHANGE THAT THEY HAVE NEVER DEALT WITH BEFORE SO ALL DONE HUNDREDS OF E.U. LAWS WILL HAVE TO BE REWRITTEN AMENDED WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WE WANT TO KEEP WHAT WE WANT TO GET SHOT OF GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS WILL BE PLUNGED INTO UPHEAVAL DEPARTMENTS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT WILL NO LONGER BE HANDING OUT MONEY THROUGH THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY THEY'LL HAVE TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN FUNDING MECHANISMS
FARMERS AND FOR FISHERIES AND THERE IS A SENSE OF THERE SIMPLY WON'T BE THE SPACE TO COME UP WITH A SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE AGENDA AND I THINK THE BRUTAL TRUTH IS BECAUSE BRECK SAID HE'S NOT GOING TO BE A BACK OF A FAG PACKET EFFORT THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER MAY INDEED FIND HE HAS VERY LITTLE TIME ENERGY AND SPACE TO DO MUCH MORE POLITICALLY
AND SIMON JOHN ROSS OR WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT ALL COST THE EXIT PROCESS ITSELF WHAT IT WILL COST THE COUNTRY BUT IT'S A SORT OF RELATED QUESTION AWAY LOTS OF WAYS YOU CAN LOOK AT COST WE'VE SEEN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IF YOU ADD UP THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED FOOTSIE TO FIFTY WHICH THE U.K. A FOCUSED ONE IF YOU ADD THEM BOTH UP THERE DOWN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED BILLION YOU CAN LOOK AT THE COST THE ECONOMY IF WE HAVE TO LOSE ONE PERCENT OF G.D.P. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION POUNDS BUT I THINK WHAT YOU MEAN JOHN IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE COST THEM I ASKED A VERY SENIOR FORMER
TO CIVIL SERVANTS ABOUT THIS AND THEY RECKON TWENTY PER CENT OF ALL TREASURY MAN HOURS AND TWENTY PER CENT OF ALL CABINET OFFICE MAN HOURS WILL GO INTO THIS FOR THE NEXT TWO TO FOUR YEARS AND THAT WOULD BE AT A COST OF EIGHTY MILLION PLUS FORTY FOR THE TREASURING AT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION POUNDS PER YEAR FOR POSSIBLY THE NEXT FOUR YEARS HALF A BILLION QUID
# MARK GIVEN THAT THERE WAS DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT RESULTS FIONA PATTERSON WANTS TO KNOW HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND WILL BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY ENGLAND AND WALES WOULD LEAVE THE E.U. AND SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND WOULD REMAIN PART OF IT
INTERESTING I'M NOT WELL IT'S THE U.K. OF COURSE THAT IS CURRENTLY AN E.U. MEMBER AND IT WILL BE THE UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT THAT PRESSES THE BUTTON FOR THE WHOLE OF THE U.K. TO WITHDRAW SO FORMALLY SPEAKING SCOTLAND MUST BE PART OF THAT PROCESS THEY MUST LEAVE ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE U.K. AND THEN IN THEORY THEY COULD BECOME AN INDEPENDENT STATE AND PERHAPS THEN APPLY IN THE NORMAL WAY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE E.U. AND THE U.K. GOVERNMENT MAY SEEK TO BLOCK ANY ATTEMPT TO BREAK UP THE UNITED KINGDOM BUT THE PRESSURE'S ON THE UNION WHO KNOWS HOW GREAT THEY MAYBE NORTHERN IRELAND
SAME AGAIN BUT PERHAPS ONE MIGHT IMAGINE THAT THEY THEY LEAVE THE E. U. K. U. K. TO BECOME PART OF AN EXISTING E.U. MEMBER JOINING WITH THE REPUBLIC THAT OF COURSE GIVEN THE HISTORY OF THE ISLAND OF IRELAND IS FAR FROM A STRAIGHTFORWARD PROPOSITION BUT NONE OF THIS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD TO BE HONEST SO THAT'S THE FORMAL POSITION BUT WE ARE IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY HERE THE E.U.
THEY MIGHT GIVEN THE UNIQUE SITUATION DECIDE TO AMEND THEIR RULES THEY COULD PERHAPS FIND A WAY FOR SCOTLAND TO INHERIT THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP SOME ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE TO ACCOMMODATE NORTHERN IRELAND THE POINT IS THAT THAT THESE ARE RULES THEY'RE JUST RULES THEY'RE NOT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND THE U.K. MIGHT BE VERY KEEN TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGE TO ITS INSTITUTION OF THE U.K. VOTING TO LEAVE BY FINDING A MECHANISM WHERE IT LOSES ONE MEMBER AND GAZE IT GAINS ONE OR TWO MORE
AND CASSIA SHEPHERD HAS CROSS I'VE SPLIT A AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE'S MINDS IS IT FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR THAT HIDEOUSLY THAT'S A SEE PEOPLE WITH A JOB TO GO TO OR FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE WHETHER HE GOT A JOB OR NOT
OH KAY WHAT HAD BEEN PART OF THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET MEANS RESPECTING FULL FREEDOM SO THAT'S THE FREE MOVEMENT OF MONEY OF CAPITAL OF GOODS SERVICES AND PEOPLE AND BEING PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET MEANS I CAN APPLY FOR A JOB IN SPAIN AS EASILY AS A SPANIARD CAN I CAN LIVE IN ANY E.U. COUNTRY BUT THEIR WEALTH
ALL THE BENEFITS I'M ENTITLED TO THAT VARIES BECAUSE THAT'S TO DO WITH NATIONAL NOT E.U. LAW AS LONG AS THAT LORD TREATS ALL E.U. CITIZENS LIVING IN THAT COUNTRY THE SAME WAY WHAT WHAT'S BEING DISCUSSED NOW THAT THE U.K.'S VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND WHERE IMMIGRATION WAS SUCH A HUGE ISSUE IN THE CAMPAIGN IS WHETHER IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE FULL OR CLOSE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT YOU CITIZENS HAVING UNLIMITED ACCESS TO THE U.K.
AND A LABOUR MARKET YOU LEADERS HAVE SAID A VERY LOUD NO ANGELA MERKEL SAYS NO CHERRY PICKING ALLOWED IN IN A FUTURE DEAL THEY DON'T WANT THE U.K. TO GET A QUICK EASY ATTRACTIVE DEAL OUTSIDE THE E.U. THAT COULD TEMPT OTHER EURO SCEPTIC MEMBER STATES TO LEAVE BUT WE HAVE TO SAY NEGOTIATIONS HAVEN'T STARTED YET THIS IS A PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION AND BRUSSELS IS KNOWN AS THE CAPITAL OF COMPROMISE OF COURSE
AND NORMAN ONE FOR YOU FROM DAVID HORN COME THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT EFFECTIVELY VETO ANY U.K. PARLIAMENT LEGISLATION AND ACTING BRECK'S IT BECAUSE OF A REQUIREMENT FOR A MOTION OF LEGISLATIVE CONSENT WITHIN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO CATEGORICALLY NO
I'M NOT A LEGAL EAGLE BUT I UNDERSTAND THE SUPPOSED TO SECTION TWENTY NINE OF THE SCOTLAND ACT NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WHICH EFFECTIVELY BINDS THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT TO ACT IN A MANNER COMPATIBLE WITH EUROPEAN LAW AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE MENDED OR REPEALED IN THE SUGGESTION IS THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT COULD SAY NO BUT ACTUALLY ALL THEY CAN DO IS WITH HOLD THEIR CONSENT THEY COULDN'T VETO
THAT PROCESS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERTS SEEM TO AGREE ON THAT THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT THE AUTHORITY THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT DOES NOT OVERRIDE THE AUTHORITY OF WESTMINSTER AND I NOTICED THE OTHER DAY ALEX SALMOND THE FORMER SCOTLAND FIRST MINISTER CONCEDED THAT NICOLA STURGEON DID NOT HAVE THAT POWER AND TO BE HONEST POLITICALLY I SUSPECTED NICOLA STURGEON DID TRY TO DO THAT WOULD PROBABLY RE IGNITE THE BATTLE OF BANNOCKBURN I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A RUNNER POLITICALLY EITHER
# NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ALSO THANKS TO MARK EASTERN SIMON JACK AND CAPTURE
IT IS NOW SEVENTEEN SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WE'VE BEEN HEARING IN THE PROGRAMME THIS MORNING ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW THAT FOUND THE CHILDREN HAVING HEART TREATMENT AT BRISTOL CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL REPEATEDLY GIVEN POOR CARE AND THEIR PARENTS WERE LET DOWN
THE REPORT WAS CHAIRED BY THE Q.C. ELLEN A GREY SHE WAS ASKED TO LOOK AT THE SPECIALIST UNIT AFTER COMPLAINTS BY THE FAMILIES OF CHILDREN TREATED THEN SHE FOUND NURSES WERE READILY UNDER PRESSURE AND THERE WAS POOR COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILIES BUT CRITICALLY SHE FOUND THAT THE OUTCOMES OF TREATMENT THERE WERE BROADLY COMPARABLE TO OTHER CENTRES
WELL WE'RE JOINED BY FAY VALENTINE IN SHE'S IN OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO HER LITTLE BOY LUKE DIED AT THE AGE OF SEVEN AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY AT THE HOSPITAL IN TWENTY TWELVE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS REPORT THAT'S COME OUT TODAY TODAY FROM ELEMENT
OBVIOUSLY HE'S A LOT TO TAKE ON IS IT'S A LARGE DOCUMENT
I THINK WHERE SHE HIGHLIGHTS FAILINGS AND THINGS DID GO WRONG IT SEEMS TO BE QUITE EASILY FASTLY DOWNPLAYED THEN THIS SEEMS TO BE NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN AFFECTED THEM OR HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES AS WELL AT THE HOSPITAL
THEY MAKE IN THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND CHANGES TO BE MADE WHICH IS GREAT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN THAT HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES AND HAVE BEEN AFFECTED SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THAT AND SEVENTEEN USED TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT REALLY WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH LUKE
WELL
THERE'S A LOT A LOT GONE ON THERE I MEAN HE WAS ONE OF THESE THEY'D BUY THAN THEIR VERY NATURE VERY COMPLICATED CASES HE WAS BORN WITH A CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT YES OBVIOUSLY WENT THROUGH FOR THE FINAL STAGE OF HIS OPERATION HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO PICK HAVE JUST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER AN INCIDENT YOU'VE GONE TOWARD THIRTY TWO WITH THE CARE THAT HE RECEIVED UP THERE WAS JUST
FRIGHTENING AND THERE WAS NO WAY BACK WE WERE PLEADING WITH STUFF SAYING HE NEEDS TO GO BACK SOMETHING'S WRONG THEY WERE JUST IGNORING US
WARD THIRTY TWO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THIS REPORT YOU FELT THAT WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAVING MORE INTENSIVE CARE THAN HE WAS GETTING YEAH HE WILL HE WAS BLEEDING INTERNALLY AND THEY DIDN'T PECK WE WERE ITALIAN SOMETHING WAS WRONG THEY BUT BUT SAID WE WERE OVER ANXIOUS PARENTS AND ANTELOPES TO LAKE LOOKS CHEST FELT WERE BLURTING OUT A CARDIAC ARREST ON THE WARD
THERE WAS NO SURGEON IN THE HOSPITAL AND SOME OF THE FOUNTAINS OF THE ARSEY ERE YOU FOUND THAT STUFF DIDN'T KNOW WAY OF RESUSCITATION EQUIPMENT WAS THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO CALL IN THE REST IT TOOK TWENTY MINUTES RESURGENT FROM HOME

# THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS WAITING FOR WHOEVER IS THE NEW PRIME MINISTER IS WHETHER TO BUILD A NEW RUNWAY IN THE SOUTH EAST HUGELY CONTROVERSIAL THE CHAIRMAN OF TESCO'S ONE THAT IT'LL BE A DISASTER IF THE DECISION IS DUCK DOMINIC I SEE SOME BREAKING NEWS AND JOHN WE'VE JUST BEEN TOLD THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO SAY TODAY THAT WE BE NEW DECISION ON A RUNWAY
UNTIL A NEW PRIME MINISTER WAS ELECTED THAT MEANS IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THERE'LL BE ANY DECISION BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND THERE ARE SOME IMMEDIATE REACTION FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WHICH WAS VERY HOPEFUL OF A NEW RUNWAY I SPOKE TO SEE A FEW MINUTES AGO TO THE CHAIRMAN OF TESCO JOHN ALLEN HE'S ALSO THE LEADER OF THE LOBBY GROUP LONDON THIRST WHAT SPEAKS FOR THE LONDON BUSINESS COMMUNITY ASK THEM WHAT THIS TODAY WOULD MEAN FOR BUSINESS IN LONDON
I THINK IT WILL BE A VERY SERIOUS SETBACK NOT JUST FOR LONDON BUT FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY BECAUSE ACTUALLY THERE'S VERY STRONG CONSENSUS I MEAN EVERY POLITICIAN I'VE EVER SPOKEN TO EXCEPT THERE'S NEED FOR MORE RUNWAY CAPACITY THAT NEED IS EVEN GREATER I THINK IN A POST BREAKS IT ENVIRONMENT WHEN WE YOU KNOW THERE IS TALK ABOUT GREATER CONNECTIVITY TO THE REST OF THE WORLD WE NEED IT
AND I THINK IT WILL BE VERY UNHELPFUL IF THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES THAT HE'S GOING TO PUT THE DECISION OFF YOU NO NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT FOR THE END TH TIME LARGELY I THINK FOR REASONS OF INTERNAL PARTY MANAGEMENT NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST TO DO SO
AND LOOKING PAST THE IMMEDIATE QUESTIONS OF RUNWAY EVEN MORE WORRYINGLY ELLEN SAID THAT BRICKS AT THE BRICKS OF VOTE MY INWARD INVESTMENT IN BRITAIN WAS NOW FROZEN
THE MOST PREDICTABLE I THINK SHORT TERM EFFECT IS THAT WE'RE CLEARLY GOING TO BE STARVED OF INWARD INVESTMENT UNTIL THERE'S CLARITY ON THE POST BREAKS SITUATION IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN INTRODUCING NEW CAR MODEL AND YOU'VE GOT TO INVEST IN A PRODUCTION LINE OR A NEW FACTORY ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD IT IN THE U.K. UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT THE POST BRACES SITUATION'S GOING TO BE OR YOU COULD BUILD IN SLOVAKIA OR SOMETHING SO I THINK WE'LL BE STARVED OF INWARD INVESTMENT
IN THAT SITUATION ONE OF THE WAYS THE GOVERNMENT COULD OFFSET THAT IS BY ACTUALLY GETTING INVOLVED IN SOME SELECTED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD PARTLY REPLACE IT STIMULATE JOBS AND SO ON
# THAT WAS JOHN ALLEN CHAIRMAN OF TESCO AND LONDON FIRST THERE'S DOMINIC NINE MINUTES TO NINE A CURE FOR ALZHEIMER'S IS A LONG WAY OFF STILL BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE AREN'T MANY WAYS OF HELPING PEOPLE WITH A HORRIBLE DISEASE ESPECIALLY IN ITS EARLIEST STAGES ONE OF THEM IS POETRY EXPERTS HAVE FOUND THAT HEARING OR READING A SPECIFIC PROBLEM
CAN TRIGGER MEMORIES OF TODAY THE CHARITY LITERATURE WORKS IS LAUNCHING AN EVENT AIMED AT HELPING PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA FIND ONE THAT WORKS FOR THEM WILL TRACY GARDI'S THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CHARITY LITERATURE WORKS SHE ALSO CARES FOR HER MOTHER SHEILA WHO HAS DEMENTIA AND ALSO JOINED HERE BY IAN SHARE OF WHOSE ACADEMIC PUNCH IT LEAVE THE DEMENTIA AT PLYMOUTH
UNIVERSITY TRACY TELL ME ABOUT HOW IT WORKS OR WHAT YOUR MOTHER HAS EXPERIENCED WE'VE LAUNCHING TODAY NATIONAL MEMORY DAY AND THAT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LITERATURE WORKS AND COMMITTEE UNIVERSITY IN THE PLYMOUTH LITERATURE PROJECT TO PLYMOUTH UNIVERSITY AND WITH ALZHEIMER'S SOCIETY AND THE POETRY ARCHIVE AND THE WAY IT WORKS IS
WE THINK THAT IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT RHYTHM AND METER THAT GOES WITH POETRY AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS I WAS TALKING TO SIR ANDREW MOTION ONCE AFTER AN EVENT AND ASKED STILL A FORMER POET LAUREATE OF THE FORMER POET LAUREATE YES I WENT RIGHT TO THE TOP AND ASKED WHAT KIND OF POEMS A WOMAN WHO WENT TO A SCHOOL IN BEDFORDSHIRE COUNTRY ONE ROOM SCHOOL IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND FORTY SEVEN AROUND THAT AGE DURING THE WAR WHAT POEMS THEY MIGHT HAVE LEARNT AND THEN I READ THEM OUT TO MY MOTHER MY MOTHER IS FULL TIME CARED FOR AT HOME BY MY BROTHER I DON'T CARE FOR HER FULL TIME AT ALL
BUT SHE HAS A FEW STORIES AND THE STORIES ARE GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER AND SHE LOVES TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND SHE LOVES TO FEEL ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN BE TALKED BACK AND HAVE PEOPLE LOOK AT HER AND LISTEN TO HER SO I RECITED SOME POEMS AND SIR ANDREW MOTION GAVE ME A LIST OF FIVE WHEN WE GOT TO THE LISTENERS SHE SPARKED UP AND SHE REALLY RESONATED WITH THE HORSE THAT'S IN THE LISTENING AND WE CAN HEAR I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF THAT
IS THERE ANYBODY THERE OH NOBBY A SUFFOLK WHAT SUFFOLK PUNCH POOR NOBBY HE TROD ON A WASPS' NEST
BUT IT'S BONE IT'S ONLY BONE WE LED HIM TO AND FRO IN THE HARVEST TIME MICHAEL AND ME
FIRST FIELD THEN BARN IN HARD THIS TIME MY BROTHER AND ME OUR NEXT WHAT'S RED
BRIGHT RED TRACTOR YES POOR NOBBY WELL I SAW AUNT MARY CUT HIM UP SHE CUT HIM UP
SHE SLICED HIM IN HER KITCHEN WITH THE FLAGS AND BLOOD BLOOD RAN OVER HER ELBOW AND TRACY THAT REALLY DID SOMETHING FOR YOUR MOTHER RESONATED WITH HER IT DID YES THAT'S THE POEM THAT SOUND YOU CREATED AFTER WE HAD READ THE LISTENERS TO HER SO SHE'LL SOON AS SHE HEARD ABOUT THE HORSE IN THE LISTENER SHE SAID I HAD A HORSE MY FAVOURITE HORSE WAS NOBBY
AND SUDDENLY THESE STORIES CAME SPILLING OUT ABOUT HOW AFTER THE WAR THAN EMISSIONS FACTORIES STARTED MAKING FARM MACHINERY SHE GOT BACK FROM SCHOOL AND ALL THE HORSES SO HE TOOK HER RIGHT BACK INTO HER CHILDHOOD ABSOLUTELY SHE IS AT THE STAGE WHERE SHE'S REMEMBERING A LOT MORE ABOUT THE WAR YEARS WHEN SHE WAS UP TO ABOUT AGE THIRTEEN SHE COMES BACK FROM SCHOOL ONE DAY AND ALL THE SHIRE HORSES ARE GONE AND IT'S A HUGE MOMENT IN HER LIFE THAT'S NOT BRILLIANT IS IT AND IAN WHAT
IS THERE ANY KIND OF ACADEMIC EXPERT SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION FOR THIS I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THAT WORDS ARE VERY POWERFUL IF I SAID TO YOU TODAY JOHN WHAT POEMS DID YOU LEARN AT SCHOOL I MEAN IF HE REFLECTED BACK NOT ONLY WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO TELL ME THE POEM BUT ALSO EMOTIONS AROUND IT AND PEOPLE YOU WERE LEARNING THAT FOLLOWS US ABSOLUTELY AND WE'RE USING THAT AS A TOOL
SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DEMENTIA CAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WE CAN TAKE THEM BACK IN TIME AND THEN THEY CAN START EXPRESSING WORDS FEELINGS ICH SICHER I'VE SEEN THIS WORK IN A COUNTRY IN A RURAL COMMUNITY WHERE A PERSON WITH DEMENTIA WAS AN EX FARMER'S WIFE AT THE RURAL POEM WAS READ TO HER SHE ACTUALLY TOOK THE PEOPLE BACK TO WEAR IN THE FIELDS EXCEPT RESEARCHER WHERE THEY WERE FEEDING THE ANIMALS TAKEN THE CTTEE ING
UP TO THE FARM HAND SO THIS PLUS MUSIC MUSIC'S VERY POWERFUL AS WELL IT STIMULATES EMOTIONS FEELINGS AND THAT SO TOGETHER THOSE TWO HOPEFULLY OVER THE NEXT YEAR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY POETS WORKING WITH PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA IN MEMORY CAFES EXCEPT AROUND THE COUNTRY AND TREATED VERY QUICK FINAL THOUGHT EVEN IF IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING AS IT WERE SCIENTIFICALLY THEY'RE GETTING PLEASURE FROM IT
IT GIVES THEM PLEASURE IT GIVES THE FAMILY PLEASURE IT GIVES ALL OF THEIR FRIENDS PLEASURE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT WHEN THEY VISIT SAINT MUM'S EYES SHE SMILES USE ENGAGED SO THE IMPACT OF IT IS OF A MUCH WIDER RIPPLE EFFECT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE MEMORY CAFES BUT ALSO EVERYBODY THAT ENGAGES WITH THEM EVERY DAY WELL GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR PROJECT HOPE A LOT OF PEOPLE GET TO HEAR ABOUT IT TRACY GARY ANDY AND SHELLEY THANK YOU
# KIDS MUCH IT'S NOW FIVE MINUTES TO NINE WE KNOW ONE THING FOR SURE ABOUT THE BATTLE FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LABOUR PARTY MOST LABOUR M.P.S WANT GERECKE JEREMY CORBIN GONE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO VOTED FOR HIM TO GO VERSES FORTY WHO SUPPORTED HIM BUT M.P.S ARE NOT THE PARTY AND IT'S THE MEMBERS WHO WILL DECIDE SO LET'S TRY TO GET SOME IDEA OF WHERE THE ARGUMENTS GOING IN THE CONSTITUENCY WE'RE JOINED FROM GLOUCESTER BY DICK GREENSLADE WHO'S CHAIR OF STROUD CONSTITUENCY LABOUR PARTY AND FROM LEEDS BY COUNCILLOR ALICE SMART
WHO IS ON THAT LEEDS CITY COUNCIL ONE OF SEVENTY SEVEN LABOUR COUNCILLORS WHO SIGNED A JOINT LETTER CALLING ON JEREMY CORBIN TO GO GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH AND WANTED MORNING DICK GREEN SAID YOU SUPPORT HIM DON'T YOU I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE WHERE WE ARE NOW ICE HAVE SPORTY JEREMY CORBIN I PROBABLY STILL WILL I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE IN THE POSITION WE ARE NOW IN THE WAY WE ARE HOUSE I HAVE NO OBJECTION WHATSOEVER TO
A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT STANDING FOR THE LEADERSHIP AGAINST JEREMY THAT'S A PERFECTLY REASONABLE THING TO DO WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS THE WAY IN WHICH A PARLIAMENT BUT PARTIES BEHAVED AS FAR AS I KNOW HER NO CONSULTATION WITH MANY OF US WHO HAVE GOT NO M.P.S TO REPRESENT US THERE DO YOU FEEL THE SAME ABOUT THE WAY THIS HAS COME ABOUT KAT ALICE SMART
I MEAN TO A DEGREE MY VIEW IS THAT THE CURRENT SITUATION FOR THE PARTY IS HE'S REALLY DEVASTATING AND IT IS FOR THE COUNTRY AS WELL YOU KNOW I MEAN WE NEED A STRONG EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION
THE WARD I REPRESENT IS ONE OF THE MOST DEPRIVED AREAS IN LEEDS AND THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT THEY HAVE A LABOUR COUNCIL THEY HAVE A LABOUR M.P. WHAT THEY NEED IS A LABOUR GOVERNMENT AND MY VIEW AND ED YOU HAVE A LOT OF MEMBERS A LOT OF STAIRS IS THAT JEREMY CORBIN JUST ISN'T ABLE TO DELIVER THAT O.K. SO YOU'RE PLEASED TO SEE THIS DEGREES DO YOU THINK HE COULD DELIVER THAT BECAUSE I'LL BE YES IT WAS THE REFERENDUM RESORT AT THE PROSPECT OF A GENERAL ELECTION THAT FOCUSED LABOUR M.P.S MINES
WELL THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE BUT
HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR THIS FROM BUT MY MONTHS SOMETHING OF THAT SORT OF BEEN STRONG OPPOSITION TO HIM IN THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY I THINK YOU'VE BEEN HAMSTRUNG ALL THE WAY HE HAS STRONG SUPPORT A GRASSROOTS LEVEL AND I THINK THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS NOT TO DO WHAT THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY DID BUTTER HAVE A STRAIGHTFORWARD VOTE FOR THE LEADERSHIP LOOKS AS THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I PROBABLY WILL SUPPORT JEREMY MYSELF BUT I WAIT TO SEE WHO THE CONTENDERS ARE NOT WHAT IS BEST FOR THE COUNTRY AND FOR THE PARTY
ALICE ALICE SMART WE KNOW THAT ANGELA EAGLE IS OUTSTANDING DO YOU THINK SHE CAN DO BETTER IN THE COUNTRY THAN JEREMY CORBIN CAT YES I DO I THINK
I THINK I THINK I THINK JEREMY HAS A LOT TO OFFER THE LABOUR PARTY AND THE LABOUR MOVEMENT AND THE WIFE WHAT DID IN SIGNING THIS LETTER AND SPEAKING OUT IS NOT A CRITICISM OF HIM AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AN ACT OF DISLOYALTY TO THE PARTY OR THE LEADER AND BUY DO YOU THINK HE ISN'T HE IS AN EFFECTIVE AND HE DOESN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE AND THE SUPPORT OF HIS M.P.S AND ITS MEMBERS
AND I HOPE THAT ANGELA EAGLE OR WHICHEVER CANDIDATE STEPS FORWARD IS ABLE TO COMMAND THAT RESPECT BOTH IN THE P. UP IAN THE WIDER MOVEMENT IN THE WIDER MEMBERSHIP THE TIMES ARE SUGGESTING THIS MORNING THAT ACTUALLY HE WANTS TO GO BUT HE'S BEING EFFECTIVELY HELD THERE BY THE SENSE THAT HE WOULD BE BETRAYING THE LABOUR MOVEMENT OF WHICH HE FEELS THAT HE REPRESENTS THAT PART WHICH HE DOES NOT HE'S BECAUSE JOHN MCDONNELL AND OTHERS ARE FORCING HIM TO STAY
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT IT RINGS LIKE WHAT I JUST DON'T KNOW IT'S A POSSIBILITY BUT I THINK THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO HAVE AN ELECTION I DON'T SEE NO REASON WHY JEREMY SHOULDN'T STAND AND LET THE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY TO SYED
IF THOSE MEMBERS AND WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS SO MANY WHO SIGNED UP FOR WHAT THREE POUNDS TO VOTE FOR JEREMY CORBIN THE CHANCES ARE THAT HE THERE'S A VERY STRONG CHANCE THAT HE WOULD BE ELECTED AGAIN THEN WHAT THE M.P.S JUST FILE IN BEHIND HIM I THINK THAT'S THEIR JOB ISN'T IT
THEY DON'T REPRESENT THE WHOLE OF THE LABOUR PARTY THEY REPRESENT SMALL PART OF IT I THINK OF THE LABOUR PARTY DECIDED TO USE THE RIGHT LEADER AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL BUT IF THEY DO AND I THINK M.P.S MUST WORK WITH HIM AND START TO LOYALTY RATHER THAN SNIPING AT HIM AND ALICE SMART IF HE IS ELECTED AGAIN WILL YOU ACCEPT HIM AS LEADER OF THE PARTY
YES ABSOLUTELY I THINK ALL M.P.S AND ALL PARTY MEMBERS SHOULD ACCEPT WHOEVER IS LEAVE THE PARTY BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND BID ME MUST LEAVE IT THERE ALICE SMART DICK GREENSLADE THANK YOU OUR EDITORS GOOD MORNING
