A COUPLE OF EXCEPTIONS ACROSS WALES AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE GOT SOME HEAVY SHOWERS FALLING AS SNOW OVER HIGHER GROUND ONE OR TWO OF THOSE SHOWERS WILL DRIFT DOWN INTO DEVON AND CORNWALL BUT THAT SHOULD FADE AWAY THROUGH THE AFTERNOON WITH SOME BRIGHTER WEATHER COMING THROUGH OVER ON THE NORTH SEA COAST THOSE SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO PECK AWAY AT CASA PARTS OF YORKSHIRE LINCOLNSHIRE INTO NORFOLK AS WELL THE FALLING SNOW AT THE MOMENT BUT THEY WILL TURN INCREASINGLY TO RAIN THROUGH THE DAY TEMPERATURES ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES TODAY ON THE CHILLY SIDE FIVE TO EIGHT WITH COLD NORTHERLY BREEZE
A COLD START ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND AS WELL AND INCREASINGLY WET ONE TO THE CEMENT RAIN SPREADING IN FROM THE NORTH COULD SEE A LITTLE BIT OF SNOW OVER THE MOUNTAINS POSSIBLY SOME ICE FOR A TIME BUT THAT WILL CLEAR AWAY A BRIGHTER AFTERNOON A DRIER AFTERNOON HIGHS OF SIX OR SEVEN DEGREES
FOR SCOTLAND QUITE A QUIET DAY ACTUALLY MOST AREAS DRY WITH SOME GOOD SUNNY SPELLS AFTER A FROSTY START A BIT MORE CLOUD FOR THE WESTERN ISLES FOR WEST COAST FROM ARGYLL NORTHWARDS WITH SOME PATCHY RAIN HIGHS AROUND FIVE OR SIX DEGREES WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT A FROST THEY TONIGHT ACROSS THE U.K. FAIRLY WIDESPREAD CLOUD THOSE SPREADING FROM THE WEST LATER IN THE NIGHT WILL TEND TO LIFT THE FROST IN MANY AREAS BUT BRING A TRANSIENT SPELL OF HILL SNOW AND THEN SOME PATCHY RAIN ON AND OFF THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW BUT AT THE SAME MUCH MILDER BY THE END OF THE WEEK
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE STORY THAT IS A MOST FRONT PAGES IS THAT OF THE NEWS THAT BRITAIN IS TO SEND SHIPS TO THE EDGY AND SUE TO HELP HER WITH THE MIGRANT CRISIS THERE AND ASH HAS U.K. WARSHIP IS DESPATCHED TO TERM BACK MIGRANTS ACT IT'S NOT A WARSHIP BUT IT IS A ROYAL NAVAL VESSEL AND A COUPLE OF BORDER VESSEL BORDER FORCE VESSELS AS WELL TRY AND THE IDEA IS TO GET INVOLVED WITH THEIR NATO MISSION
TO HELP EASE THE MIGRANT CRISIS ENGULFING EUROPE U.K. DEPLOYS TROOPS IN REFUGEE CRISIS IS THE HEADLINE IN THE GUARDIAN AT KAMEN SENDS NAVY TO STOP MARGARET SMUGGLERS IN THE TIMES AND U.K. WARSHIP DISPATCHED AMBER MAGGOTS IN THE INDEPENDENT
DON'T TELEGRAPH DOES NOT THINK MUCH OF THE STORY THAT YOU HAD ABOUT THE NEWS WE'RE GOING TO BE COVERING YOU IN THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME BUT MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE BEING ASKED TO TAKE PERSONAL M.O. TAYZA MAKE LIFESTYLE CHANGES TO DOUBLE THEIR CHANCE OF A HEALTHY RETIREMENT IS QUITE A BIG PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGNS GOING TO START THREE AND A HALF MILLION POUNDS BEING SPENT ON THAT INCLUDING APPARENTLY A FIVE MINUTE QUIZ ASKING PEOPLE QUESTIONS SUCH SUCH AS HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW WITH A SLIDING SCALE RESPONSE FROM REALLY KNACKERED TO FULL OF BEANS
AND OF COURSE ASKING HOW MUCH YOU DRINK HOW MUCH YOU SMOKE AT SAINT TRY AND THE INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS GIVEN A QUOTE DON'T TELEGRAPH SAYING IT'S US BOUNDING THAT THIS HECTORING QUANGO HE'S SQUANDERING THREE MILLION POUNDS PROMOTING A TEDIOUS WEBSITE THAT NOBODY WOULD VISIT
AT THE INDEPENDENT HAS A ROUGH HER REMARKABLE STORY ABOUT A CAR PARK THAT YOU CAN'T DRIVE TO IT WAS PART OF A REDEVELOPMENT IT WAS PUT ON A ROOF ABOVE A GYM COMPLEX IN FARNBOROUGH AND IN THE WORDS OF THE INDEPENDENT RESIDENTS OF THE HAMPSHIRE TOWN ALLEGEDLY PLAYED BY PARKING PROBLEMS REACTED WITH INCREDULITY TO THE NEWS OF THIS SECRET REEF TOP CAR PARK THERE'S BEEN HAVE BEEN LYING UNUSED ABOVE THEM FOR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY BE REACHED BY FOOT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO DRIP DROP OFF THEIR CAR THERE TO DO A BIT OF SHOPPING WILL EITHER NEED
WE NEED SOME SORT OF CUNNING PLAN IN THE WORDS THE INDEPENDENT OR CRANE IS EXTRAORDINARY STORY THE TIME IS TEN PAST SIX THE ROYAL NAVY AS WE WERE HEARING IS GOING TO BE JOINING A NATO DEPLOYMENT IN THIS OGEE AND SEA AIR DANNY SAVAGES ON THE GREEK ISLAND OF LES BOSS AND SARAH'S MAKING CAREFUL DISTINCTION BETWEEN A WARSHIP AND SOME OTHER KIND OF WHAT ACTUALLY ARE WE SENDING WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO
WE'RE GOING TO JUSTIN YES R. F. A. MOUNT'S BAY THE MOST WARSHIPS ARE H.M.S. HER MAJESTY'S SHIP THIS ONE IS ROYAL FLEET AUXILIARY MAN SPACE IT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A CLUE FOR THE SHIP'S ROLE IT'S NOT A WARSHIP IT'S A LARGE ONE THOUGH IT'S PAINTED BATTLESHIP GREY IT HAS A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE FRONT SUPER STRUCTURE AT THE FRONT AND THEN HAVE THE LONG BACK FLAT BECKETT'S AN AMPHIBIOUS LANDING SHIP
IT'S GOING TO BE HERE IN THE IN BASICALLY USING A HELICOPTER THAT'S ON BOARD TO PATROL THE COASTLINE BETWEEN TURKEY AND GREECE TO HAVE A LOOK LET'S GET AN OVERVIEW OF THAT AREA BETWEEN THE ISLANDS BETWEEN THOSE SHORTER CROSSINGS THAT THOSE BOATS ARE MAKING OFF WITH MIGRANTS ON ACROSS THE AEGEAN HERE TO ISLANDS LIKE LES BOSS AND WILL BE OUT
AT SEA AND SPOTTING THE SMUGGLERS AND ARE LURKING ALERTING THE TURKISH COAST GUARD TO WEAR THOSE SMUGGLERS ARE SENDING PEOPLE FROM THE BEACHES SO THAT THEY CAN INTERCEPT THE SMUGGLERS AND B. THEY COULD INTERCEPT THE BOATS AND SEND THEM
BECAUSE THE WHOLE AIM OF THIS OPERATION BASICALLY AND IT'S NOT JUST THE U.K. THAT SENDING ASSETS HERE IT'S LOTS OF THE OTHER NATO FORCES AS WELL IT'S TO STOP THE FLOW OF WATER ACROSS THAT STOP THE FLOW OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE EDGY AND HERE TO THE ISLANDS FOR PEOPLE COMING ACROSS BECAUSE IT'S STILL HAPPENING ALL THE TIME AND WE'VE BEEN WITNESSING IT ALL WEEKEND HERE YEAH THAT'S AN INTELLIGENCE GATHERING ROLE BUT IF THE INTELLIGENCE IS USED BY THE TURKISH SIDE THEN HE'S USELESS
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT HAS BEEN THE ISSUE SO FAR BECAUSE THERE ARE AGREEMENTS ALREADY IN PLACE TO TRY AND STOP PEOPLE COMING ACROSS FROM TURKEY AND IT'S NOT WORKING AND THERE WAS A FEELING HERE ON THE ISLAND I THINK I'M ON THE OTHER ISLANDS IN THE GREEK AREA THAT BASICALLY THE TURKISH COASTGUARD ESPECIALLY IS JUST NOT DOING ENOUGH
TO TURN THESE MIGRANT BOATS AROUND IT OFTEN SEES THEM BUT IT'S NOT MAKING ENOUGH EFFORT TO SEND THEM BACK AND WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT IS THAT IT'S A NARROW STRAIGHT SAY SAY IT'S FIVE OR SIX MILES BETWEEN HERE AND TURKEY THE INTERNATIONAL WATER LINE IS DOWN THE MIDDLE AS SOON AS THEY COME INTO GREEK WATERS THOSE BOATS HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BY GREEK COASTGUARD
AND THE PEOPLE HAVE BEING BOUGHT OFF THE BOATS ON THE GREEK COASTGUARD SHEEP'S AND BOUGHT INTO PORT EN MASSE SO YESTERDAY WE SAW TONIGHT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PEOPLE BROUGHT IN ON ONE BOATS OR SITTING ON THE DECK BEEN BOUGHT INTO THE PORT HERE LOOKING PRETTY SORRY FOR THEMSELVES AFTER BEING HAULED OUT OF THOSE LITTLE BOATS AT SEA BY THE GREEK COASTGUARD JUST INTEGRATE WATERS AND BRINGING THEM HERE
DANNY SAVAGE ON LESBOS THANKS IT'S NOW THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX DEMOCRATS IN THE U.S. STATE OF MAINE HAVE JUST CHOSEN BERNIE SANDERS AS THEIR CANDIDATE BUT HE IS TRAILING SOME DISTANCE BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON IN THE RACE TO BE THEIR PARTY'S CANDIDATE THEY WERE UP AGAINST EACH OTHER AND DEBATE ON C.N.N. LAST NIGHT AND I SPOKE TO OUR CORRESPONDENT KIM CAT ASS ABOUT IT
VERY FABULOUS WAS MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN USUAL
HE USED A LOT OF CUTTING ATTACKS AGAINST HIS DEMOCRATIC RIVAL HILLARY CLINTON AND HE ATTACKED HER AS A LONGTIME SUPPORTER OF FREE TRADE HE INTERRUPTED HER QUITE A BIT WHICH DID NOT GO DOWN WELL WITH THE AUDIENCE
AND THAT'S PERHAPS BECAUSE THIS IS SANDRA'S FEELS THAT THE NOMINATION IS SLIPPING OUT OF HIS HANDS HE STILL HAS A LOT OF RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO STAY IN THIS RACE AND FIGHTS FIGHT MISSUS CLINTON STATE BY STATE BUT SHE IS NOW WELL AHEAD OF HIM
IN THE COUNT OF DELEGATES THAT SHE NEEDS TO SEIZE THE DOMINATION WHAT DO THEY BOTH SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP RACE TO BE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WELL THEY BOTH INSIST THAT THEY'RE THE BEST PLACED TO WIN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IF THEY'RE UP AGAINST MISTER TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ON HER PART HAS TAKEN TO
PUSHING BACK AGAINST MISSUS TRUMP RHETORIC THAT SHE'S DESCRIBED AS HATEFUL HAD BIGOTED BY CALLING FOR KINDNESS AND LOVE SHE'S SAID THINGS LIKE I KNOW THAT PEOPLE WILL ROLL THEIR EYES WHEN POLITICIANS SAY THESE WORDS BUT I THINK THIS WORKS BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IN THE CLINTON CAMP THEY'RE GETTING READY FOR WHAT COULD BE A VERY
TOUGH THEN PERHAPS NASTY FIGHT IF MISTER TRUMP DOES INDEED BECOME THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE AND INDEED IF OR IS IT JUST A CASE OF WHEN SHE BECOMES A DEMOCRATIC ONE
BY THE MIDDLE OF MARCH IT WILL BECOME ALMOST MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR MISTER SANDRA'S TO WIN THE NOMINATION WE HAVE MICHIGAN COMING UP
ON TUESDAY WITH THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN DELEGATES UP FOR GRABS AND THEN FLORIDA WHERE MISSUS CLINTON IS THE LEADING OF THE PORES BY A POLICE THIRTY POINTS AND THAT'S TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DELEGATES BUT AS I SAID MISTER SANDERS IS INTENT ON STAYING IN THIS RACE
AS LONG AS HE CAN HE SAYS UNTIL THE CONVENTION IN JULY AND TO SOME EXTENT OF THE ENERGY THAT HE BRINGS TO THE RACE WILL BE HELPFUL TO MISSUS CLINTON HE HAS A LOT OF VERY YOUNG SUPPORTERS AND SHE WILL NEED THEM TO TURN OUT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER
THANKS VERY MUCH THE TIME QUARTER PAST SIX VERY BIG NEWS OVERNIGHT ABOUT E.D.F. ENERGY FIRM WITH THEM SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS POTENTIALLY FOR PLANS TO BUILD NEW NUCLEAR PLANT AT HINKLEY POINT JOE IS HERE WITH THAT AND THE REST THE BUSINESS YOU'VE POINT THANK YOU GOOD MORNING JUSTIN YES ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG SOURCES THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AT E.D.F. TOM UP YOU COME OW HAS OFFERED HIS RESIGNATION
BECAUSE THE NEW NUCLEAR REACTOR AT HINCKLEY IN SOMERSET COULD RUIN THE ENTIRE COMPANY THE EIGHTEEN BILLION POUND INVESTMENT IN BRITAIN COSTS MORE THAN THE ENTIRE VALUE OF E.D.F. MARKETS GUEST THIS MORNING IS MARK A SHADOW FROM LLOYDS BY THE CHIEF INVESTMENT SIR GOOD MORNING TO YOU MARCUS CAN I ASK WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING ON HERE AT THESE REPORTS ARE TRUE
YES SO CLEARLY THE FRENCH GIANT TO EIGHTY FIVE PER STAY DON'T AND I THINK WHAT IS ALSO RENTED A PROJECT IS THAT THE PROJECT HAD AND HAS CHINESE INVESTORS WHO MIGHT BE CHANGING THEIR VIEWS ON THE PROJECT THEY CLEARLY WE'VE HAD A FALL DRAMATIC FALL IN ENERGY PRICES AND ELECTRICITY PRICES OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS AND THEREFORE THE CONSIDERATION OF THE PROJECT FROM A COMMERCIAL STANDPOINT
IT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY OVER RECENT MONTHS I KNOW YOU CAN COME ON A POLITICAL ISSUES MARCUS BUT IT DOES APPEAR TO SOME AS IF THE POLITICAL WILL TO FORCED THROUGH THE HINKLEY POINT PROJECT BY THE BRITS AND THE FRENCH SEEMS TO BE OVERRIDING THAT THE FINANCIAL SENSE OF THE INVESTMENT BECAUSE AS I SAID THE INVESTMENT IS NOW WORTH MORE THAN YOUR ENTIRE VALUE
IT IS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TOO TO REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT E.D.F. HAS A NUMBER OF THOSE PROJECT ON AT THE MOMENT SO THIS IS I THINK ALSO RELEVANT ANTS AS YOU HAVE HINTED THAT THE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES ARE IN ALMOST A BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT AND ALSO I THINK IT'S A SIGN THAT E.D.F. HE'S RECENTLY BORROWED BILLIONS TO PAYS DIVIDENDS SO THERE'S QUITE IT'S QUITE A TOUGH
SITUATION A TOUGH CALL IT'S A PERFECT STORM FOR E.D.F. ISN'T IT BECAUSE AS YOU SAID THE OIL PRICES HAVE COLLAPSED SO THEIR POTENTIAL PROFITS OF REVENUES ARE FALLING BUT THIS DEAL THEY'VE ALREADY COMMITTED TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO THIS DEALER I JUST WONDER WHETHER WHETHER IF THIS RESIGNATION IS TRUE WHETHER THAT WILL PROVE THE END OF THE PROJECT WILL JUST BASICALLY HAVE TO BE CANCELLED
THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY AT THIS STAGE YOU NEED TO DEAD PRICES THERE AGAIN APART FROM THE THE CORE QUALITY PRICES FALLING NETWORK COSTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS HAVE RISEN DRAMATICALLY AS WELL WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY PART OF THERE NOT ONLY TO COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS BUT ALSO THE POLITICAL ANGLE AT THIS PROJECT LET'S MOVE ON TO SENIOR MANAGERS REGIME WHICH COMES INTO FORCE TODAY WHICH MAKES SENIOR BANKERS PERSONALLY LIABLE
FOR MISTAKES OR FRAUD COMMITTED BY ONE OF THEIR TEAM THEY COULD EVEN GO TO JAIL AND THAT'S WHAT LET ME START BY ASKING ARE YOU A SENIOR MANAGER POTENTIALLY ARE YOU ON THE HOOK I AM A SENIOR MANAGER AND I'M AFFECTED BY SENIOR MANAGERS REGIME AND ITS WIDE RANGING REGULAR TORY CHANGE PUTS CUSTOMERS AT THE SCENT OF ALL DECISION MAKING WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD THING WE HAD LLOYD'S SUPPORTERS INTO INDUSTRY WIDE INITIATIVE OF COURSE AND WE ARE FULLY PREPARED
TRAINING HAS TO BE PUT IN PLACE WHAT IS REALLY A POUT IT'S ABOUT STRENGTHENING THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF BANKS AND TO RAISE STANDARDS OF INDIVIDUAL CONDUCT AT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF WRITTEN DOWN THERE BUT DO YOU THINK IT WILL CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR OF THE MINDSET THERE GOES ON THE BANKERS AND ALSO I YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT WORRIED THAT YOU MIGHT END UP IN JAIL DUE TO A MISTAKE OR SOMEONE ELSE SO I THINK IT IS LARGELY OR IS IT HAS ALREADY CHANGED BEHAVIOUR OF MANAGERS IN BANKS BECAUSE
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD MONTHS OF PREPARATION FOR THIS AND I THINK THERE IS MUCH MORE CLARITY AND POSITION NOW ABOUT MINIATURES ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF US WORK TOGETHER CLOSELY TO MAKE THIS WORK AND TO DEFINE WHAT IS CALLED YOU KNOW THE DESIGNATED SENIOR MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AND ALSO THEIR PRESCRIBED RESPONSIBILITIES WERE ALLOCATED TO ME AND COLLEAGUES IN AT LLOYDS AS WELL AS IN OTHER BANKS I THINK
THAT CLAIRE HAD IS USEFUL MAKES IT ALSO MORE TRANSPARENT FROM THE OUTSIDE TO LOOK AT BANKS AND TO UNDERSTAND THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO PRO MARKET MARCUS AT WOMAN THAT STAB HIM AND THEY'RE FROM LLOYDS BANK THANKS FOR JOINING US THE CREDIT RATINGS AGENCY MOODY'S HAS PUT SAUDI ARABIA THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES KUWAIT AND CATARRH ON REVIEW FOR A POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE
IT'S ALSO CUT BAR RAINS SOVEREIGN AND RACING TO JUNK LAST WEEK BLAMING INDIA RECORD LOW OIL PRICES BUT MANY OF US JUST SAW THIS AS A BELATED RESPONSE TO OLD NEWS COLIN ELLIS IS CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER AT MOVIES GOOD MORNING TO YOU COLIN GOOD MORNING
IS IT A LATE RESPONSE TO PLUNGING OIL PRICES I THINK IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHERE OIL PRICES WILL SETTLE WE'VE ONLY RECENTLY REVISED DOWN OUR IN HOUSE ASSUMPTION WHICH WE BASE ALL OF OUR RATINGS ON FOR OIL PRICES AND SO WE NEEDED TO REFLECT THAT IN RATINGS HAVING DONE SO
AND WHAT IS THERE TO WORRY ABOUT SPECIFICALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THESE THESE ARE PETROL ECONOMIES THEY'RE DEPENDENT ON OIL BUT THEY'RE ALSO SITTING ON HUGE CASH CUSHIONS YES I THINK THE REVIEW WILL FOCUS REALLY ON TWO THINGS THE FIRST IS
HOW DOES HOW DO THESE LOWER PRICES FEED TO IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMIC AND PHYSICAL DETERIORATION THAT WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE FOR EACH OF THESE COUNTRIES TELL YOU THERE'S A SINGLE PREVAILING RISK FACTOR THAT'S RELEVANT FOR ALL OF THEM BUT THAT DEGREE OF DETERIORATION COULD VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY
AND THE SECOND THING WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON IS WHAT'S THE POLICY RESPONSE GOVERNMENT'S OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LOT OF LEVERS THAT THEY CAN PULL TO ADJUST AND COPE WITH LOW OIL PRICES BUT WE WANT TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT HOW THOSE CHOICES DIFFER FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND HOW EFFECTIVE THEY WILL BE
MOODY'S DON'T TELL GOVERNMENTS WHAT TO DO BUT THEY DO DROP HUGE HINTS SHOULD THESE COUNTRIES DIVERSIFY MORE WE SOLD DUBAI DID BY TURNING SO INTO HER SHOPPING AND TRAVEL MECHA USING THE TERM COULD CELTIC ARABIA DO THAT
AS YOU SAID WE DON'T GIVE POLICY ADVICE BUT ONE THING WE DEFINITELY LOOK FOR IN ALL OF OUR SUFFERINGS AS A DEGREE OF DIVERSIFICATION AND RESILIENCE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE FEW COUNTRIES WERE THE ONLY ONE IN THIS OIL REVIEW THAT WE AFFIRM THE RATING WAS NORWAY ON FRIDAY NO WAY HAS A VERY WELL DIVERSIFIED VERY STRONG ECONOMY AND ACTUALLY DESPITE THE FALL IN OIL PRICES WERE STILL SING TAX REVENUES
AND THE CURRENT ACCOUNT POSITION HOLDING UP REMARKABLY WELL SO DIVERSIFICATION CAN DEFINITELY BOOST YOUR CREDIT STANDING VERY BRIEFLY WHAT COUNTRY SHOULD READ BE PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT
WELL I MEAN OUR RATINGS ARE RELATIVE RANK ORDERING SO THE FURTHER DOWN THE RATING SCALE YOU GO THE MORE CONCERNED VENEZUELA WAS SUITABLY THREE NEGATIVE SO THAT'S AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN BE TO DEFAULT WITHOUT ACTUALLY DEFAULTED
O.K. THANKS VERY MUCH COLIN ELLIS FROM MOVIES REPORT REPORTER TODAY BY A THINK TANK THE INDEPENDENT TRANSPORT COMMISSION SUGGESTS THAT AIRCRAFT NOISE AND EMISSIONS FROM LARGE AIRPORTS SUCH AS HEATHROW AND GATWICK ARE NOT AS BIG AN ISSUE AS MANY HAD CLAIMED DOCTOR STEPHEN HICKEY JOINS ME NOW FROM THE I.T.C. GOOD MORNING DOCTOR TOPIC IT GOOD MORNING
I SUPPOSE WE NEED TO STRESS THAT SOME OF YOUR AT THINK TANK IS FUNDED BY HEATHROW AND GATWICK IS A TRUE THEY'RE BOTH MEMBERS WERE FUNDED BY QUITE A WIDE RANGE OF TRANSPORT AND RELATED INDUSTRIES BUT WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT THINK TANK AND WE COMMISSION INDEPENDENT RESEARCH OH KAY AND YOU'RE FOUND AS I SUGGESTED THAT NOISE AND EMISSIONS SUCH AS NITRIC OXIDE WON'T BE AS BIG BEGIN ISSUE AS MANY HAD FEARED WELL WHICH AS WE KNOW THE DAVIS COMMISSION RECOMMENDED EXPANSION AND PARTICULARLY THE MAJOR HUB AIRPORT WHICH IS MUSIC AS HEATHROW
AND THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS FOR THAT WERE VERY STRONG BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS PAUSED ON MAKING A DECISION ON THAT BECAUSE OF CONCERN PROPER CONCERN ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS SO WE THOUGHT IT'D BE USEFUL TO LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE INDUSTRY IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE OPERATIONS TO SEE HOW WELL HOW OLD BASE THOSE CONCERNS MIGHT BE
YOUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT LARGER AIRPLANES SUCH AS THE LARGER SEVEN FORTY SEVENS THEY ATE THREE EIGHTIES WILL DRIVE FUEL EFFICIENCIES BUT LARGER PLANES ARE ALSO NOISIER HOW DO YOU SQUARE THAT CIRCLE THE ESSENTIALLY IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE YOUR C.O.TWO IT'S BETTER TOO
PUT MORE PASSENGERS ON ONE PLANE AS IT WERE THAT HAVE LOTS OF INDIVIDUAL PLANES SO THAT'S THE NUTS THERE'S A QUITE A BIG C.O.TWO TO ADVANTAGE IN THE USE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF BIG PLANES RATHER LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL PLANES IN TERMS OF NOISE THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT CLEARLY IS THAT IT CONCENTRATES THE NOISE AT ONE PLACE RATHER THAN SPREADS IT MORE WIDELY AND THERE ARE PROS AND CONS ABOUT THAT
BUT IN TERMS OF NOISE THE OVERALL FINDINGS OF THE REPORT OF THAT ACTUALLY NOISE HAS BEEN COMING DOWN VERY MARKEDLY OVER THE LAST SORT OF THIRTY OR SO YEARS AND THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS QUITE STRONGLY THAT NOISE WILL CONTINUE TO REDUCE OVER THE NEXT THIRTY OR SO YEARS DOCTOR STEPHEN TICKET HICKEY THERE FROM THE INDEPENDENT TRANSPORT COMMISSION THANKS FOR JOINING US THEY'RE GETTING MORE WOMEN INTO WORK COULD BRING THE U.K. ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION POUNDS OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS ACCORDING TO P.W. SEES WOMEN IN WORK INDEX
THE U.K. RISES TO SIXTEENTH PLACE ON THE INDEX UP FROM TWENTY FIRST OR TWENTY FOURTEEN DUE TO LOWER FEMALE UNEMPLOYMENT AND A NARROWING OF THE GENDER PAY GAP JOINING ME NOW IS GAYNOR BADLY FROM YOUR HEAD OF PEOPLE AT P.W.C. THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT O.K. UP TO SIXTEEN GREAT GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHO'S ABOVE US OF THE MAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRY SO THE IGNORED COMPANIES ARE AT EVER CONSISTENTLY WE'VE BEEN DOING IS INDEX OR RIGHT AT THE TOP SAID ICELAND THAT'S RIGHT U. S. IS JUST ABOUT WORSE FOR A FRANCIS ABOVE US
JENNY'S JUST BELOW US NEVERLAND IT'S BELOW US THEY WERE IN THERE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK REALLY CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHERE THE HUNDRED SEVENTY BILLION POUNDS COMES FROM AND WHAT PERIOD IS THAT IT'S REALLY JUST A SNAPSHOT IS ILLUSTRATIVE FIGURE TO SHOW THAT THERE IS AN ECONOMIC IMPACT OF GETTING MORE WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE HE SAID TO ME JUST RECALCULATED THE NUMBERS ASSUMING THAT WE HAD AS MANY FEMALE WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE FULL TIME AND PART TIME THAT'S THE REAL DIFFERENT IT IS A GUESSTIMATE
IN TERMS OF GETTING WOMEN INTO THE WORKFORCE BRITAIN'S ECONOMY'S MOSTLY SERVICES BASED THAT CANNOT BE SAID FOR MANY OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE ABOVE BRITAIN IN THE LIST SO WHY CAN'T BRITAIN GET PEOPLE WHO WORK IN SERVICE SECTOR TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE HOW THE EMPLOY WOMEN
I WISH I KNEW THE EAR THERE WAS THERE WAS A SILVER BULLET I THINK THAT IS THE I THINK THAT IS THE ANSWER IS A KIND OF CULTURAL THING THAT WE TEND TO THINK OF WORK IS NINETY FIVE IN THE OFFICE IT'S FULL TIME AND IF YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU HAVE TO GO PART TIME AND THERE'S GOT TO BE A MIDDLE GROUND THEM IN FACT THAT'S THE WAY I WORK MYSELF LOTS OF US DO SO SO BEING FLEXIBLE USING TECHNOLOGY MEASURING OUTPUT
NOT IN POETS SAID THAT THE WORK GETS DONE WE HAD TO TRUST A WORKFORCE TO GET IT DONE IN THE RIGHT AND IS THAT A QUESTION OF WOMEN NEEDING TO CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE WOULD TO GET BACK TO WORK FOR US OR EMPLOYERS NEEDING TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURES WITHIN WHICH THEY WORK IT'S BOTH I THINK AND I THINK IT'S MANY EMPLOYERS HAVE TO GIVE PERMISSION IN THAT THE YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE MEASURING OUTPUT'S NOT INPUTS AND PERMISSION TO WORK FLEXIBLY VERY CLEARLY GET THE MESSAGE THAT THEY TRUST THEIR WORKFORCE TO WORK IN A WAY THAT WORKS FOR THEIR FAMILY LIFE GAYNOR BADLY THERE HEAD OF PEOPLE APPEAR BE THANKS FOR JOINING US THANKS COLIN THANKS MARCUS

TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN THE E.U. AND TURKEYS WE WERE HERE ARE GOING TO HOLD AN EMERGENCY SUMMIT TODAY ON MIGRATION CHRIS MORRIS CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE AND IT FEELS CHRIS LIKE A A CRUNCH MOMENT
YES JUST IN A LOT OF BIG ELEMENTS COMING TOGETHER I THINK THERE'S AN ELEMENT AND SOME OF IT OF DECLARING THE STABLE DOOR SHUT AFTER THE HORSE HAS BOLTED BECAUSE WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THERE IS GOING TO BE A COLLECTIVE DECLARATION TODAY THAT THE ROUTE THROUGH THE BALKANS IS CLOSED WELL IT'S ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED THAT THROUGH UNILATERAL DECISIONS TO IMPOSE BORDER RESTRICTIONS AND BUILD FENCES
AND THOSE RESTRICTIONS OF COURSE MEAN THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE NOW STUCK IN GREECE WITH THAT NUMBER RISING EVERY DAY AS MORE PEOPLE ARRIVED IN THE GREEK ISLANDS SO ONCE AGAIN WE GET TO THE CRITICAL ISSUE CO OPERATION WITH TURKEY AND TRYING TO STOP THE VAST MAJORITY OF REFUGEES MIGRANTS GETTING TO EUROPE IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IS NOT WITHOUT CONTROVERSY AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL FOR EXAMPLE
SAYING THIS MORNING THAT THIS IS A DANGEROUS AND DELIBERATE PLOY BY E.U. LEADERS TO SHIRK THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND NEWS TURKEY AS THEIR OWN BORDER GUARD TO STOP PEOPLE FLEEING WAR AND PERSECUTION SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF LEGAL AND MORAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY FORWARD FOR TURKEYS ALREADY BEEN PROMISED A LOT OF THINGS HAVE MEANT INCLUDING MONEY IN ORDER TO KEEP PEOPLE THERE HOW HAS THAT HAVE THOSE PROMISE HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED DORIS TURKEY NOT KEEPING IT SIDE OF THE BARGAIN WHAT'S GOING ON
THERE'S A BIT OF CHICKEN AND EGG GOING ON TURKEY SAYS IT WILL DO THINGS ONCE EUROPE DOES THINGS AND VICE VERSA THE MONEY HAS BEEN PROMISED IT WILL BE DELIVERED THREE BILLION EUROS I THINK THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE IS THE IDEA OF A MASS RETURN OF PEOPLE AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE POTENTIALLY ALL NON SYRIANS BEING SENT BACK FROM THE GREEK ISLANDS TO TURKEY OR PERHAPS EVEN BEING INTERCEPTED BY THIS NEW NATO OPERATION AND BEING SENT BACK TO TURKEY
IS TURKEY IN THE INTERNATIONAL JARGON A SAFE COUNTRY A LOT OF PEOPLE OR PULL ARGUE THAT IT ISN'T THERE'S A THERE'S A WAR GOING ON IN THE SOUTH EAST OF TURKEY AGAINST THE KURDISH MINORITY WE'VE SEEN
HOW TURKEYS DEALING AT THE MOMENT WITH CRITICISM WE SAW THE CLOSURE OF THE MAIN NEWSPAPER OR THE TAKEOVER THE MAIN NEWSPAPER IN TURKEY OVER THE WEEKEND A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THAT TURKEY IS NOT A SAFE PLACE TO RETURN PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE BEEN SEEKING ASYLUM IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WILL HEAR FROM THE TURKEY'S DEPUTY AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K. TEN PAST EIGHT CHRIS MORRIS THANKS

THE POOREST HERE SPEAK NO FRENCH ONLY RANDY I ASKED THEM WHETHER THEY FEEL ANY HOPE FOR THE FUTURE EXCUSE OWN DID DISPLAY
THEY'RE REAL ALI IS NOT SO MUCH FOR MEDICAL CARE OR BECK O.K. SHOULD BUT QUITE SIMPLY SECURITY BECAUSE
FOR SOME TIME NOW THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO OUTSIDE AT NIGHT BECAUSE THERE ARE SHOOTINGS THE EXPLOSIONS BUT THAT IT'S NOW A PLACE WHERE THE SECURITY FORCES DON'T TEND TO COME
WE DRIVE TO ANOTHER CHURCH THAT CONVOY SURROUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT SECURITY FORCES ON THE STREET THERE'S AN ATMOSPHERE OF FOREBODING AND POLICE ON EVERY CORNER
FOR MANY YEARS FOR UNDIE FOUGHT A BLOODY CIVIL WAR LIKE NEIGHBOURING RWANDA BETWEEN WHO TO AND TUTSI THERE'S ETHNIC SPLIT FOR THREATENING TO RESURFACE AGAIN AS A PRESIDENT SEEKS TO CLING TO POWER IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE CHURCH STILL HAS INFLUENCE A DELICATE BALANCING ACT PLAY WHERE DOES SEAN I'VE I DID FOR YEAR BOOK

THEN THE BEST AND HIMSELF ARRIVES PERFORMER THROUGH TO REBEL LEADER AND A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY SEEKS TO PERSUADE HIM OF THE NEED TO BRING HIS COUNTRY TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF ALL
WHETHER PEER HUNKER IN DIESER WILL LISTEN TO THIS MAN OF GOD IS FAR FROM CLEAR WHERE THE ARCHBISHOP HOPES THEIR TALKS WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE HE CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAS A TIME WHERE THERE WAS A NEED FOR RECONCILIATION I
UNDERSTOOD THAT HAS OBVIOUSLY MEETING MEANING WITH THE OPPOSITION THERE'S A REAL PASSION FOR THE COUNTRY TO GO FOR
THE SENSE OF DARKNESS THERE'S A GOOD LEVEL
BUT THERE IS ALSO THIS THIS REAL CONCERN ABOUT WHAT WHERE THEY MIGHT
THE BUTCHER BURROUGHS ANGLICAN CATHEDRAL JUSTIN WELBY SPOKE FROM THE HEART ISN'T CALLED ON ITS PEOPLE AS HE DID ITS PRESIDENT TO RECONCILE AND FORGIVE
BEFORE THE ETHNIC HATREDS OF THE PAST ARE REEKIN

MATT LAYERS UNISON NATIONAL ENERGY OFFICER HE JOINS US FROM LEICESTER GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE PLAN TO CUT THAT TO CUT JOBS WELL PRECIOUS LITTLE REALLY WHICH IS VERY DISAPPOINTING WHEN THIS NEWS COMES OUT LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL BE VERY WORRIED
WE HAD VERY LITTLE TO TALK ABOUT IN THE SENSE THAT THE BUSINESS ITSELF HASN'T GIVERS GIVING ANY INFORMATION RIGHT I MEAN WE ARE BUT THEY'RE POST PUBLISHING THEIR FOLIA RESULTS TOMORROW SO I'LL GIVE ME THAT IS THE TIME AT WHICH THEY GO PUBLIC WITH THE NEWS ONE WELL THE THING IS WHEN THIS SORT OF NEWS COMES OUT OFTEN
TRADE UNIONS ARE GIVEN INFORMATION PRE BRIEF SO THAT WE CAN AT LEAST RESPOND AND TRY AND DEAL WITH SOME OF THE HUGE ISSUES THAT ARISE FROM THIS SORT OF STUFF
ALL WE HAVE IS THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE IN THE MEDIA RIGHT SO YOU'RE LEARNING BECAUSE THE B.B.C. UNDERSTANDS ITS SALES AND MARKETING ROLES THAT ARE GOING TO BE WORST HIT YES I MEAN WE'VE SEEN JOBS ALREADY LOST IN THIS BUSINESS WE SAW A LOT OF JOBS OFFSHORE TO WE'VE SEEN WORK OUTSOURCED TO TO CONTRACTORS
THIS IS ALL PART OF THE PROBLEM THIS BUSINESS NEEDS INVESTMENT IT NEEDS TO IMPROVE ITS LEVELS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I FOR ONE CANNOT SEE
FURTHER AXING OF JOBS IN THIS WAY A QUARTER OF THE WORKFORCE CAN SIGNIFY ANY SORT OF HOPE FOR RECOVERY
IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE ARE PROBLEMS THAT ARE PECULIAR TO NPOWER OR IS IT AS A RESULT OF THEIR FALLING OIL AND GAS PRICES AND THEREFORE OTHER SUPPLIES ARE IN SIMILAR SITUATION WELL UNQUESTIONABLY OTHER SUPPLIERS HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND WE'RE DEALING WITH
BEEN DOING THIS LODGE JOB LOSSES AND OTHER BUSINESSES THE REALITY WITH EMPIRE POWER IS THAT IT IS IN A PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH WITH TERMS IT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS
AND LOTS OF CUSTOMERS AND WE WANT THE BUSINESS TO TURN THAT AROUND AND WE ARE ASKING AND HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME NOW FOR A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN THAT AREA TO ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS AREN'T KEPT WAITING TO ENSURE THE PROPER BILLING TAKES PLACE THAT REQUIRES MORE PEOPLE MORE JOBS AND BETTER SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT WORK CAN BE CARRIED OUT AND THE REALITY IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS AFTER PATTERN IS REORGANISATION MANAGEMENT CULT FILMS COMING IN TO SAY YOU NEED TO DO THIS YOU NEED TO DO THAT

THE FINES THAT HAVE BEEN LEVELLED AGAINST THE BUSINESS AND I THINK IF YOU TOOK THAT INTO ACCOUNT THE SITUATION MAY BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THE REALITY IS IT WAS TWENTY SIX MILLION POUNDS IN DECEMBER THEY WERE ORDERED TO PAY TO THAT WAS JUST THE FINE BUT THEN OF COURSE THERE'S BEING REPEATED PROBLEMS WITH BUILDING
WHICH WILL HAVE LED TO A LOSS OF REVENUE INTO THE BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS IS LOSING CUSTOMERS AND THEY NEED TO HAVE A STRATEGY TO TURN THAT AROUND TO HOLD ON TO THOSE CUSTOMERS TO GROW THE CUSTOMER BASE THAT LES THANKS VERY MUCH

HAD SAID THAT IT WAS BEHIND AN ATTACK ON A PRISON OFFICER IN BELFAST ON FRIDAY THE FIFTY TWO YEAR OLD MAN WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED ONE A BOMB EXPLODED UNDER HIS VAN AS HE WAS DRIVING TO WORK THREE MEN AND A WOMAN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED HE WAS OUR IRELAND CORRESPONDENT CHRIS BUTLER
IN A STATEMENT TO THE B. B. C. THE GROUP SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE NEW IORI SAID ITS MEMBERS CARRIED OUT LAST WEEK'S UNDER CAR BOMB ATTACK AND IT CLAIMED THEY TARGETED THE PRISON OFFICER BECAUSE HE'D BEEN TREATING COLLEAGUES WHO WORK IN THE GALLERY NORTHERN IRELAND'S HIGH SECURITY JILL WHAT DISSIDENT REPUBLICAN PRISONERS ARE HELD
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NEW I.R.A. WHICH WAS FORMED OUT OF A NUMBER OF OTHER DISSIDENT GROUP BEANS WENT ON TO CLAIM THAT THE BOMB CONTAINED A QUANTITY OF THE EXPLOSION OF SEMTEX
WILL CONCERN THE POLICE WHO HAVE ALREADY WARNED THE DISSIDENTS ARE PLANNING TO TRY TO KILL MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES TO COINCIDE WITH THE CENTENARY OF THE EASTER RISING WHICH WAS A REBELLION IN IRELAND AGAINST BRITISH RULE
THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN HAS SET OUT PLANS TO CHANGE WHAT SHE CALLS AN OUTDATED INEFFICIENT AND UNFAIR SCHOOL FUNDING SYSTEM IN ENGLAND SHE SAID THERE WERE ANOMALIES TO BE IRONED OUT FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOLS IN ROTHERHAM RECEIVE FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS MORE PER PUPIL EACH YEAR IN SCHOOLS IN PLYMOUTH DESPITE SIMILAR LEVELS OF NEED
SHE CONCEDED THAT SOME SCHOOLS WOULD LOSE MONEY BUT THE OVERALL SCHOOLS' BUDGET WOULD BE PROTECTED LABOUR'S SAID THE DEVIL WOULD BE IN THE DETAIL MISSUS MORGAN SAID A KEY PROPOSAL WAS TO FUND ALL SCHOOLS DIRECTLY RATHER THAN THROUGH LOCAL AUTHORITIES
THERE ARE HISTORICAL ANOMALY SINGS OR HAVEN'T BEEN TACKLED NOW FOR OVER A DECADE THERE ARE IN EFFECT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO DIFFERENT FORMULAE OPERATING ACROSS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE GIVEN HER MONEY AND THEN THEY HAND OUT THREE DIFFERENT FORMULAS LOCALLY WE NOW SEE THAT THERE ARE SCHOOLS WHERE EVEN JUST ACROSS A NEIGHBOURING BOUNDARY THERE'S HUNDREDS OF POUNDS' WORTH OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCHOOLS THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT OR SUSTAINABLE GOING FORWARD
PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND IS URGING PEOPLE TO ADOPT A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE IN MIDDLE AGE TO DOUBLE THEIR CHANCES OF GOOD HEALTH IN OLD AGE THE ONE NEW CAMPAIGN IS DESIGNED TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL ADVICE ON HOW TO AVOID DISEASES IN RETIREMENT WHICH COULD SAVE THE N.H.S. BILLIONS OF POUNDS EACH YEAR THERE'S A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT DOMINIC HUGHES
LIFE EXPECTANCY IN THE U.K. IS AT A RECORD HIGH BUT THE YEARS WE LIVE FREE OF ILL HEALTH HAVE NOT KEPT PACE SO WE'RE LIVING LONGER BUT WE'RE ALSO SICKER THE NEW CAMPAIGN BY PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND AIMS TO CHANGE THIS PICTURE IN PARTICULAR IT'S TARGETING THOSE NOW ENTERING MIDDLE AGE BETWEEN THE AGES OF FORTY AND SIXTY A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE VIEW THAT GOOD HEALTH IN MIDDLE AGE GREATLY INCREASES THE CHANCE OF A HEALTHY OLD AGE
EXPERTS SAY IMPROVING DIET BEING MORE ACTIVE CUTTING DOWN ON DRINKING AND STOPPING SMOKING CAN PAY DIVIDENDS WHEN THEY'RE OLDER AND THAT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO CHANGE BAD HABITS WHAT ARE KNOWN AS LIFESTYLE FACTORS ACCOUNT FOR AROUND FORTY PERCENT OF ALL DEATHS IN ENGLAND AND HER ESTIMATED TO COST THE N.H.S. ELEVEN BILLION POUNDS EACH YEAR
THE MAN CREDITED WITH THE INVENTION OF EMAIL THE AMERICAN RAY TOMLINSON HAS DIED HE WAS SEVENTY FOUR HE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SENDING ELECTRONIC MESSAGES FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER ACROSS NETWORKS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AND PIONEERED THE USE OF THE AT SYMBOL IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE AMERICAN RADIO STATION N. P. PEART ASKED RAY TOMLINSON WHAT WAS IN THE FIRST EMAIL
EVERYBODY ASKED THAT BUT I DON'T REMEMBER EVERY SINGLE WORD OF IT THE MAIN THING IS THERE ARE A LOT OF TEST MESSAGES THESE THINGS DON'T WORK OUT OF THE BOX COUSIN WAS NO BACH'S EVERY TIME YOU TEST YOU HAVE TO GENERATE SOME KIND OF A MESSAGE AND YOU MIGHT DRAG YOUR FINGERS ACROSS THE CUBE OR JUST TAPE THE OPENING PHRASE FROM LINCOLN'S GETTYSBURG ADDRESS OR SOMETHING ELSE SO TECHNICALLY THE FIRST EMAIL US COMPLETELY FORGETTABLE AND THEREFORE FOR GARDEN RAY TOMLINSON
THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN BRITAIN IS SENDING A SHIP OPERATED BY THE ROYAL NAVY AND TO BORDER FORCE VESSELS TO THE MEDITERRANEAN TO JOIN A NATO MISSION TO STOP MIGRANTS CROSSING FROM TURKEY TO EUROPE THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE MEETING OTHER E.U. LEADERS TODAY FOR AN EMERGENCY SUMMIT TO CONSIDER WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP GREECE AND TURKEY THIS WOMAN HAD A GREEK REFUGEE CAMP MADE A DESPERATE PLEA TO BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE HER JOURNEY FURTHER INTO EUROPE
AND I WAS HERE WE ARE YOUNG AND BE CHILDREN BAGHDAD'S SO HE'D HAPPILY WITH THEM BAPS YEAH WE CAN HEAR BEHIND ME
AND NOW I CAN'T YOU OFFER YOUR MANATEE LENNY NOT THAT THIS IS WHERE THERE'S NOT A WAY TO STAY HERE THERE'S NO HERE PLEASE
NEVER O.K. WELL WE'RE JOINED FROM WESTMINSTER BY THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED TODAY AS PART OF THAT'S SOLUTION THAT SHE REFERS TO THEIR MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT WE ARE SENDING A NUMBER OF SHIPS FROM THE LOOK OF THEM I MEAN THEY'RE THE SHIP HAS BEEN OPERATED BY THE ROYAL NAVY IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL SHIP WHAT DOES THE HOPE THAT THIS THEY CAN ACHIEVE
WELL FIRST OF ALL IT IS A NAVY SHIP WITH MARINES ON BOARD WITH MEDICS ON BOARD AND IT IS DESIGNED TO HELP THE HELP BUILD UP A PROPER PICTURE OF WHO WHO IS BEING SENT ACROSS THIS PARTICULAR GAP BETWEEN GREECE AND TURKEY AND TO HELP THE GREEK AND TURKISH COASTGUARDS DEAL WITH IT WE'RE NOT SENDING A WARSHIP
WARSHIPS AREN'T THE BEST KIND OF SHIPS TO RESCUE SMUGGLERS AND EXHILARATION SHIP WITH PLENTY OF SPACE PLENTY OF STORES AND ABOVE ALL WITH A HELICOPTER ON BOARD AND THAT WILL JOIN THE GERMAN CHIP GREEK SHIP A TURKEY SHIP AN ITALIAN SHIP AND A CANADIAN SHIP IN TRYING TO BRING SOME ORDER TO THIS PART OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ABOVE ALL TO SAVE LIVES OH KAY SAY THE SO IT'S
ITS MISSION IS TO PICK UP PEOPLE THAT IT FINDS IN THE SEA AND RESCUE THEM THE PRIMARY MISSION IS TO BUILD UP A PROPER PICTURE OF THE SMUGGLING ROUTE OBVIOUSLY IF THERE ARE MIGRANTS AT SEA THE LAW OF THE SEA DICTATES THE NEAREST VESSEL MUST PICK THEM UP THE FIRST THING IS TO BUILD UP A PICTURE OF THESE ROOTS AND TO START BREAKING THE SMUGGLERS BUSINESS MODEL SMUGGLERS ARE MAKING MONEY OUT OF PEOPLE DROWNING NOW WE'VE HAD SEVERAL HUNDRED
DROWNED THIS WINTER SEVERAL THOUSAND DROWNED THIS YEAR AND WHAT'S ESSENTIAL IS TO WORK OUT WHERE THIS SMUGGLING IS PEOPLE SMUGGLING WAS DONE FROM AND THEN TO GET A POLICY IN PLACE OF RETURNING PEOPLE WHICH IN THE END WILL STOP PEOPLE MAKING THIS VERY VERY DANGEROUS CROSSING IT HASN'T SEEMED THAT THAT HAS BEEN THIS SORT OF ITS BUT IT'S A GAP IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ROOTS THAT IS THE PROBLEM
IT IS SOME IN THERE ARE SMUGGLERS COMING ACROSS RIGHT ACROSS THE GEUM FROM LES BOSS IN THE NORTH TURN TWO THROUGH THE DODECANESE TO TEQUILA SOUL NUMBER OF OF ISLAND ROUTES ARE BEING ATTEMPTED AND THEY'RE BEING ATTEMPTED BY ORGANISED GANGS WHO ARE TRAFFICKING PEOPLE NOW THERE MAKING MONEY OUT OF THIS ARE TAKING PEOPLE NOT FROM SYRIA BUT FROM AFGHANISTAN PAKISTAN PLACES MUCH FURTHER AFIELD AND WE HAVE TO PUT A STOP TO THIS BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE LIVES LOST AND MORE MISERY O.K. SO
LET'S ASSUME THAT THEIR INTELLIGENCE IS PICKED UP IT'S ESTABLISHED THAT THERE IS A ROOT WHAT THEN HAPPENS YOU FEED THE INFORMATION TO THE TURKISH COAST GUARD AND THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THEY DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THAT ROUTE AND YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT YES THE TURKEY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO CROSS ALREADY THIS YEAR THE TURKISH COASTGUARD AND INDEED THE GREEK AUTHORITIES ARE BECOMING FRANKLY OVERWHELMED AND WE NEED TO DO MORE TO HELP BRING BUILD UP THERE
CAPACITY TO HELP THEM GET A PICTURE OF WHERE THE SMUGGLING IS BEING ATTEMPTED AND ABOVE ALL TO START RETURNING PEOPLE WHAT'S NOT HAPPENED SO FAR ANYWHERE IN EUROPE IS THAT PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN RETURN ONCE THEY START BEING RETURNED THAN THERE IS LESS PROSPECT OF PEOPLE PAYING MONEY AND THE SMUGGLERS MAKING MONEY OUT OF WHAT IS A VERY DANGEROUS CROSSING YOU SAY THAT TURKEY IS BEING OVERWHELMED AND THEY NEED HELP BUT WE HAVE DONE AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DEPUTY AT THE TURKISH DEPUTY AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K. WHICH WILL BE RUNNING IN AN HOUR'S TIME AND HE SAID
LOTS OF MONEY'S BEEN PROMISED NO MONEY HAS YET TURNED UP TO HELP TURKEY AND THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE MAKING EXACTLY THAT POINT AT THE MEETING IN BRUSSELS TODAY EUROPE HAS PROMISED TURKEY AND THAT NOW NEEDS TO BE DELIVERED AND THE COASTGUARD THERE NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED AND WE NEED TO TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO HELP TURKEY WAS TAKEN IN A HUGE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS NOT JUST FROM SYRIA BUT IS NOW TAKING PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET CROOKED CROSS TURKEY INTO EUROPE SO WE HAD DO WE HAVE TO HELP
AND IN IN AND THE WAY THAT WE HELP WILL WIN NOW AGREED TO AN E.U. COASTGUARD BEING SET UP BY THE SUMMER WHICH IS WHAT THE E.U. COMMISSION WANTS OTHERS ALREADY WE'RE NOT PART OF THIS OF COURSE BECAUSE WE'RE OUTSIDE THE BORA AREA LET ME MAKE THAT CLEAR THE UNITED KINGDOM IS NOT PART OF SHOW AND SO WE WE'RE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE BORDER THING BUT WE'RE HELPING WE HAVE THE BIGGEST NAVY IN EUROPE WHEN PEOPLE ARE BEING DRUNK SURE RIGHT WE HELP THE Y. YOU BECAUSE THIS IS PART OF THE PROCESS OF DEALING WITH THIS IS THAT THERE IS
FURTHER INTEGRATION IN THE REST OF THE E.U. FOR IT THE SETTING UP OF A COASTGUARD THAT IS RUN BY THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION TO DECIDE WE'RE NOT PART OF IT BUT IF THEY WANT TO STRENGTHEN THE WHAT'S CALLED THE FROM TEX THE BORDER FORCE OPERATION THEN THAT'S ENTIRELY A MATTER FOR THEM BUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS PARTICULAR CRISIS
MICHAEL FALLON THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE TIME FORTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN BARACK OBAMA AS LED TRIBUTES TO NANCY REAGAN WHO DIED AT THE AGE OF NINETY FOUR YESTERDAY SHE WAS THE PRESIDENT OF WARM AND GENEROUS PERSON WHO HAD REDEFINED WHAT IT MEANT TO BE THE FIRST LADY PRESENT DIDN'T ALWAYS TREAT HER WITH SUCH RESPECT IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND MATE JUST AFTER BEING ELECTED HE HAD TO APOLOGISED AFTER MAKING THIS CARELESS REMARK IN TERMS
AND SPEAKING TO FORMER PRESIDENTS I'VE SPOKEN TO ALL OF THEM THAT ARE LIVING OBVIOUSLY PRESENT IN COURT AND I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A ABOUT THIS OH YES THE SENSES THE ASTROLOGERS THE WHITE HOUSE REFURBISHMENT THE ANTI DRUGS CAMPAIGN THAT PEOPLE SAID WAS PREDICTABLE AND CONDEMN TO FAILURE
SHE SAW HER FAIR SHARE OF CONTROVERSY DID NANCY REAGAN BUT SHE SAILED THROUGH IT AND IN RECENT YEARS AS BARACK OBAMA DISCOVERED WITH THE REACTION TO THAT REMARK SHE WAS REGARDED BY AMERICANS RIGHT ACROSS THE POLITICAL DIVIDE AS A PERSON OF SUBSTANCE AND INTEGRITY I'VE BEEN TALKING TO GAIL HODGES BUT WHO WAS THE WHITE HOUSE SOCIAL SECRETARY UNDER THE REAGAN'S CAME TO NAME NANCY WELL AND VISITED HER JUST LAST OCTOBER
IT WAS POIGNANT BECAUSE SHE SAID THAT SHE FELT THAT GOD HAD FORGOTTEN I SORT OF KNEW WHICH MEANT BY DAD AND WE DISCUSSED HOW GOD I HADN'T FORGOTTEN HER BECAUSE HE WANTED HER TO STAY AROUND TO YOU SEE THAT HER HUSBAND HAD BECOME THE GOLD STANDARD FOR WYATT A PRESIDENT SHOULD BE BY BOAT
THE REPUBLICAN AND THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AT THE END OF HER LIFE SHE WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT RONALD REAGAN HAD GONE FROM BEING A GRADE B. MOVIE ACTOR TO REALLY THE GOLD STANDARD OF WHAT A PRESIDENT SHOULD BE AND WHEN SHE TOLD YOU THAT GOD HAD FORGOTTEN SHE SHE JUST MEANT THAT SHE SHOULDN'T STILL BE HERE SO MANY OF HER FRIENDS WEREN'T EXACTLY ONE BY ONE THEY WERE AT LEAVING HER AND I THINK CARING FOR
HER HUSBAND WAS A VERY LONELY DECADE IN HER LIFE WHERE SHE DID IT BEAUTIFULLY AND WITHOUT COMPLAINT OF COURSE
I'M SURE THAT SHE FELT LONELY DURING THAT TIME TAKE THIS BACK TO THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU MET HER FIRST TIME I MET HER I WAS INTERVIEWED BY HER UPSTAIRS IN THE RESIDENCE OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND I HAD LUNCH WITH MY DIVA PRIOR TO THE INTERVIEW AND HE TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD NOT FORGET WHEN I WENT
AND FOR MY DAD TO RONALD REAGAN WOULD NOT BE PRESIDENT WERE IT NOT FOR MISSUS REAGAN AND HE SAID IF YOU GET THE JOB YOU SHOULD NEVER FORGET THAT I WAS GOING ON WITH THE ASTROLOGERS I THINK THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT OF RONALD REAGAN PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED HER YOU KNOW SHE IS FROM A CERTAIN
THINGS LIKE THAT WORSE SOME WYATT YOU KNOW PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE CONSULTED ASTROLOGERS HER REFURBISHMENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE CAUSED CONTROVERSY DIDN'T IT BECAUSE OF ITS EXPENSE AND THE SENSE IN WHICH IT SEEMED TO BE GILDING IT IN A WAY THAT WASN'T NECESSARY HOW DID SHE
RECOVER FROM THAT BECAUSE A COURSE AND ONCE SHE LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE AND CERTAINLY AFTER SHE LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE SHE WAS GENUINELY A VERY POPULAR PERSON THE REFURBISHMENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE WAS DION COMPLETELY WITH PRIVATE MONEY NOT WITH ANY GOVERNMENT MONEY I ALWAYS FELT THAT SHE GOT A BAD RAP FROM THEM AT BECAUSE IT WAS MONEY THAT SHE RAISED PRIVATELY FROM FROM FRIENDS AND IT DIDN'T COST
THE TAX PAID HER ANYTHING SHE WAS ABLE TO DIFFUSE IT BY DRESSING UP AS A BAG LADY M. GOING TO WITH A GRID GRIDIRON GAYNOR AND SINGING A SECOND HAND CLOSE TO SECOND HAND ROW I WAS I WOULD SAY THAT AFTER THEY WARM TO HER AND TALKING OF WARMING TO HER
AFTER SHE'D LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE SHE CAMPAIGN DIDN'T SHE FOR RESEARCH INTO STEM CELL TECHNOLOGY THIS WAS IN CONNECTION OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT SIMON'S THAT HER HUSBAND WAS SUFFERING FROM AND DID SO IN THE TEETH OF CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT THAT WAS REALLY GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TOOK SOME GUTS
WHERE AGAIN AND WAVES ARE FRIENDS AFTER LEAVING THE WHITE HOW SHE WOULD NEVER ENDORSE A CANDIDATE SHE ALWAYS WAITED FOR THE PARTY TO NOMINATE A CANDIDATE SHE DIDN'T ROCK THE BOAT SO THERE WERE TIMES YOU DIDN'T TIME SHE DIDN'T IRAQ IT GAIL HODGES BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US

IT'S MID AFTERNOON HERE THE SUN IS SHINING AT PADDINGTON RECREATIONAL GROUND HERE IN WEST LONDON
LOTS OF SICKNESS ACTIVITIES GOING ON AROUND HERE THERE'S AN OUTDOOR GYM DIRECTLY OPPOSITE ME A HOCKEY GROUND JUST BEHIND IT AND THE RUNNING
I'M MARK HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES CAN BE ENCOURAGED TO BE MORE FEET I'VE GOT A DOG SO DO YOU GO DOG WALKING BUT I THINK IT'S TIME ISN'T IT HE'S HAVING THE TIME SAW THAT SORT OF THING WHEN YOU WORK FULL TIME YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY IS ACTUALLY QUITE DIFFICULT TO FIND TIME BUT HAVING THE HAT THAT WAS A DOG DOG WALKING IS EASY ISN'T IT YOU CAN JUST TAKE YOUR DOG OUT BUT IT IS A DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE PUT OFF AND YOU HAVE AN EXCITED YOU'VE BEEN AT SCHOOL HOW COULD YOU BE ENCOURAGED
I THINK WE WERE INTIMIDATED FROM AS YOU SAY AND WORRIED ABOUT NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP YEAH AND HOW THEY LOOK BACK IN THE GYM TOTALLY IF THERE WAS A LOT OF COLOUR YOUNG FIT PEOPLE IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE ANSWER
TO HAVE MAYBE JIM'S MORE OPEN TO PEOPLE OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES MAYBE
MY NAME'S ALEX I'M SMART A COACH OUTCOMES FROM ESSENCE TO HOCKEY CLUB SO AS A TRAINER AND A COACH HOW WOULD YOU ENCOURAGE A FORTY EIGHT YEAR OLD COUCH POTATO Y. HOPES TO DO EXERCISE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FIND AN EXERCISE THAT YOU FIND ACCESSIBLE AND SUITABLE TO YOUR LIFESTYLE SO DOESN'T MEAN NECESSARILY SIGNING UP FOR A MARATHON OR JOINING A GYM SO MAYBE HE'S JOINING A KIND OF A CLUB
YOU CAN PLAY CASUALLY ONCE FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS JOINING A RUNNING CLUB WALKING A TOG GAVE SWIMMING JUST AS EASIER SAID THAN DONE THOUGH ISN'T IT TO GET UP AND SWIM OR PLAY SPORTS EVERY WEEK WITH YOUR FRIENDS IT'S NOT AS EASY IS IT
I THINK YOU JUST NEED TO START SMALL YOU NEED TO SET YOURSELF A TARGET SAVING THAT'S RIGHT ONCE A WEEK I'M GOING TO GO FOR A SWIM AND THE NEXT MONTH O.K. I'M GO TWICE A WEEK I KNEW ONCE WE CONSUME TWENTY MINUTES AND PUT IN HER DIARY I THOUGHT IT'S A REALLY GOOD TIP THERE IT'S IN THERE YOU'VE GOT TO GO IT'S LIKE A MEETING ON APPOINTMENT YOU GOING SWIMMING YOU GOING RUNNING GOING WALKING WHATEVER
PEOPLE IN A PARK TALKING TO SEE MY POTENTIAL AND I AM JOINED HERE BY PROFESSOR KEVIN FENTON WHO'S NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF HEALTH AND WELL BEING PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE MORNING TO YOU THAT YOU WERE NODDING AS YOU WERE LISTENING TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE ABOUT MAKING SMALL CHANGES EVERY DAY AND BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THOSE CHANGES THAT CAN REALLY HELP TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH HER HEALTH
ARE YOU NOT IN FANTASISING PEOPLE THEY'D BY TALKING TO THEM IN THE WAY THAT YOU ARE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY KNOW THESE THINGS HAPPENED TO THE NEED TO BE
LECTURED HECTOR PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IN THIS WAY WELL YOU KNOW WE OFTEN ASSUME THAT PEOPLE KNOW THESE THINGS BUT THE REALITY IS MANY OF US DON'T WE GET BOMBARDED BY MESSAGES AND SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY HARD TO TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL THE MESSAGES THAT WERE GETTING AND OF COURSE THE EVIDENCE IS CHANGING EVERY DAY SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE UPDATE THE KEY MESSAGES THAN EVIDENCE SO PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS RISK WHAT ARE YOU UP DATA THEN THEN I MIGHT NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD
SO FOR EXAMPLE HOW THESE RISKS WHETHER IT'S SMOKING EXERCISE OR WE MIGHT SMOKING'S HOLIDAY I'LL BE NO BETTER EXERCISE IS GOOD FOR US WE DON'T NEED TO TELL US THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S NEW DATA SAYS THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU DON'T INVEST IN SOME OF THESE HEALTHY BEHAVIOUR DOING YOUR ADULTHOOD THAN YOUR RISK OF DEMENTIA CAN BE INCREASED SO HAS THIS NEW INFORMATION IT'S A REAL ENGLISH RATHER I MEAN WE KNOW THOSE THINGS ARE HEALTHY BUT WHAT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT WE WILL YOU'RE DOING THEN IS MAKING THAT DIRECT
LINK BETWEEN THOSE BEHAVIOURS THOSE THINGS WE DO AND THE STUFF THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO US LATER ABSOLUTELY AND PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER SO INSTEAD OF HAVING SINGLE MESSAGES ON SMOKING TODAY IN A BEASTLY TOMORROW PUTTING IT TOGETHER IN ONE PACKAGE SO THAT WE ARE HELPING PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS
BOTH FOR THEIR ASSAULT TERM AS WELL AS FOR THE LONG TERM AS WELL AND IT'S COSTING THREE MILLION PRESUMABLY A DROP IN THE OCEAN WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT COULD BE SAVED IF WE WERE TO TAKE THIS AND BUY ABSOLUTELY THESE CONDITIONS THESE BEHAVIOURS RESULT IN CONDITIONS WHICH COSTS THE N.H.S. NEARLY ELEVEN BILLION POUNDS PER YEAR SO THIS IS A VERY SMALL INVESTMENT BUT THROUGH THIS WE CAN HAVE A NEW ENGAGEMENT AND EMPOWERING AND INFORMATIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BUT STEPS THAT THEY CAN TAKE TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW DEFINITE THIS IS TO WORK BECAUSE I SUPPOSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
PEOPLE WILL BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHETHER THE TONYS RIDE AND WHETHER THE ACTUAL METHODS YOU'RE USING TO GET TO PEOPLE ARE RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS WHETHER THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY DO NEED TO BE GOT TO WILL BE GOT TO BUY THIS KIND OF PROGRESS WHAT THE GOOD THING IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE RUNNING VERY SUCCESS TE SUCCESSFUL NATIONAL CAMPAIGN SO WHETHER A CHANGE FOR LIFE CAMPAIGN WHICH AND GAITERS FAMILIES AND CHILDREN OR THE STOPPED OVER CAMPAIGN WHICH WE RUN EVERY YEAR WHICH ENGAGES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SMOKERS TO HELP THEM TO QUIT
AND WE KNOW THAT THESE FRONT CAMPAIGNS ARE EFFECTIVE IN BOTH RAISING AWARENESS AND CHANGING BEHAVIOUR SO ARE PLAYING THE BEST TECHNIQUES FROM THE LESSONS LEARNT FROM THOSE CAMPING WHAT ACTUALLY ARE YOU GOING TO MEND IT JUST JUST GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MESSAGE WE'LL REACH PEOPLE SIR FIRST OF ALL USING THE LANGUAGE THAT REALLY RESONATES WITH PEOPLE SO THEY ARE ONLINE QUIZ WHICH REALLY DOES A SELF ASSESSMENT FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC USE USES EVERYDAY LANGUAGE WHICH IS REALLY SO WHETHER KNACKERED EXACTLY COLOURFUL AND CREATIVE TO ENGAGE PEOPLE
AND THEN SECOND WE'RE USING A RANGE OF ONLINE TOOLS THAT WERE LINKING PEOPLE TOO SO THAT WHETHER YOU'RE ON FACEBOOK OR WAITING ON TWITTER YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS TOOLS AND THEY CAN HELP YOU TO REDUCE YOUR DRINKING BEHAVIOUR'S BECOME MORE ACTIVE
OR OF COURSE MY WHOLE FEELING ARE YOU GOING TO MONITOR THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS WORKING AND BENNETT IF IT IS WELL ABSOLUTELY WE DO THIS FOR ALL OF OUR CAMPAIGNS ALL OF OUR CAMPAIGNS ARE RIGOUROUSLY VALUE IT WILL SORT OF BE LOOKING AT THAT ONLINE ENGAGEMENT WITH ON THE ONE YOU CAMPAIGN WE ALSO BE LOOKING AT POPULATION DATA TO SHOW WHETHER OR NOT BEHAVIOURS ARE ACTUALLY CHANGING HER RAPIDLY ARE CHANGING BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO REALLY HELP ALL OF US TO IMPROVE HEALTH

THE LOCAL COUNCIL DENIES MISMANAGEMENT AND EXPLAINS THAT PLANS FOR A LINK UP WITH A NEARBY MULTI STOREY CAR PARK HAVE BEEN DELAYED IT IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT ONE OF THE HOTTEST TOPICS IN SCIENCES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SPECIFICALLY WHETHER HEY HI WELL OUR ROBOTS ALREADY COMPUTERS WITHOUT BODIES TO BECOME SUPERIOR TO HUMANS EVEN A THREATENING US AS STEPHEN HAWKINS WORN
I HEARD DON'T TELL WHITLAND EDWARD CROP RUN AND BRILLIANT CREASING HUMANS WHO ARE LIMITED BY LAW PLAY A LOT
CAMBRIDGE SCIENCE FESTIVAL BEGINS TODAY AND ASKS WHERE THERE REALLY IS THE CASE THAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MIGHT MATCH OUR OWN WHAT WILL THE WORLD LOOK LIKE WITH REALLY CLEVER MACHINES EVEN CREATIVE THOUGHTFUL PLANTS BARBARA SACK HIM IS ON THE LINE YOU'RE A SCIENTIST AT THE UNIVERSITY IN CAMBRIDGE AND SAYS PROFESSOR ALAN WINFIELD ENGINEER AND ROBO ETHICIST HE'S ON THE LINE FROM BRISTOL GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING MORNING PROFESSORS OR HACK HIM FIRST OF ALL ARE WE TALKING
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAVE WE REACHED A STAGE NOW WHERE WE ARE GENUINELY TALKING ABOUT
COMPUTERS OR ROBOT THAT ARE IT'S IN AN UNDERSTANDABLE SENSE CLEVERER THAN WE ARE
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THIS MOVING AHEAD VERY RAPIDLY AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE MOVING TO THE BENEFIT OF SOCIETY BUT AT THE MOMENT MOST OF THESE COMPUTERS EVEN THE VERY VERY CLEVER ONES WHICH CAN BE GRAND MASTERS CHESS OR A GIRL A VERY DEDICATED MACHINES SO UNLIKE YOUR EYES WHERE WE CAN DO MANY THINGS WE HAVE TO DO OUR OWN JOBS AND WE HAVE TO
I HAVE DIFFERENT ROLES AS PARENTS OR THEN WE HAVE TO PUT SOME OF US MAY HAVE SPECIAL GIFTS OF BEING ABLE TO SING IN THE CHOIR OR PLAY THE PIANO AND HE'S A VERY DEAD DEDICATE MACHINE SEW MY OWN VIEW IS THAT THE MACHINE WON'T BE TAKING US OVER COMPLETELY AT ANY
VERY CLOSE TIME IN THE FUTURE BUT DOES THAT GIVE US A SPACE THEN PROFESSOR WINFIELD WHERE WE MISSION SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE SITUATION THAT MIGHT BE UPON US WHEN WHEN THEY DO THREATEN US A RIVAL US YES ABSOLUTELY SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT FOR INSTANCE A ICE SYSTEMS
ARE ENGINEERED TO HIGH STANDARDS OF SAFETY AND ACCOUNTABILITY SO NO LESS THAN WE'D EXPECT ABOUT WASHING MACHINES CARS AND AEROPLANES SO YOU KNOW AS A HIGH SYSTEMS MOVE FROM PERHAPS SOMEWHAT IN AN INCONSEQUENTIAL TO SAFETY CRITICAL
WE NEED I THINK GOVERNMENTS FRAMEWORK SO NO LET ME EXPLAIN IF AN A.I. RECOMMENDS THAT YOU BUY A PARTICULAR BOOK AND IT TURNS OUT IT WAS A BAD RECKON AND RECOMMENDATION IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH BUT WHEN A.I.S SYSTEMS ARE DRIVING YOUR CAR IT MATTERS A GREAT DEAL SO SUCH AYE SYSTEMS WILL NEED INDUSTRY STANDARDS
TRUSTED BODIES TO CERTIFY THEIR SAFETY AND TO INVESTIGATE WHEN THEY GO WRONG PERHAPS A KIND OF DRIVERLESS CAR EQUIVALENT OF THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY AND WHO SHOULD THAT BE PROFESSORS WE THOUGHT SUFFICIENTLY ABOUT HOW WE HOW WE ORGANISE
NO I DON'T THINK WE HAVE UM WE HAVEN'T ENOUGH EITHER ABOUT HOW SOCIETY IN THE FUTURE WILL BE AFFECTED BECAUSE OF COURSE WITH ALL THESE THINGS LIKE DRIVERLESS CARS AND ROBOTS AND FACTORIES AND SO FORTH PEOPLE WILL BE HAVING TO DO DIFFERENT KINDS OF JOBS
COULD BE VERY GOOD FOR SOCIETY WE MIGHT HAVE MORE LEISURE TIME WE CAN SPEND WITH OUR FAMILIES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW BEING IN THE WORKPLACE IS VERY FOR FILLING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU GET A SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT WELL BEING AND YOU SOCIALLY INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALAN SAID THAT THESE MACHINES ARE ACTUALLY USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF SOCIETY
AND THE THING THAT STEPHEN HAWKING WAS WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT THE LONGER TERM THREAT ALAN WINFIELD THE IDEA THAT WE CREATE
MACHINES THAT SOMEHOW HAVE THEIR OWN CREATIVITY THEIR OWN SEPARATENESS
RIMMER US DID IS THAT A KIND OF SEPARATE ORDER OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO WORK AT IT IS YES I MEAN IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT THING I MEAN MY OWN VIEW IS THAT THE GAP BETWEEN CURRENT A.I. AND AND KIND OF HUMAN EQUIVALENT TO A.I. IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE GAP BETWEEN
CURRENT SPACE ENGINES IF YOU LIKE IN THE WARP DRIVE THE STAR TREK WARP DRIVE THERE'S A LONG WAY OFF IT'S A VERY LONG WAY OFF YES DO YOU AGREE PROFESSOR SACK HIM ANOTHER ONE DO YOU AGREE THAT'S A LONG WAY OFF NUMBER TWO WOULD IT BE RIGHT OR IS IT SIMPLY TOO EARLY FOR US TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT MACHINES THAT HAD SOULS OR THOUGHT OF THEMSELVES AS HAVING SOLD
I DO AGREE WITH ALAN I THINK THE FACT IS THAT ALTHOUGH MACHINE LEARNING US MOVING AHEAD VERY RAPIDLY AND THAT'S ABLE TO HELP MACHINED LEARN WE STILL AS HUMANS HAVE MOTIVATION GOALS SELECTION COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND WE HAVE WE'RE VERY FAST AT SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND WE HAVE EMPATHY
SO THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN DO THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR COMPUTERS TO DO IT WAS STEPHEN'S TALKING WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS WAS MACHINES AND TAKING OFF ON THEIR OWN AS HE PUT IT RE DESIGNING THEMSELVES AT AN EVER INCREASING RATE WELL BALANCE BETTER PLACED TO COMMENT ON THAT BUT I DO I DO THINK THAT THAT WILL NOT BE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE EVEN MACHINE LEARNING AS HELPING THEM TO LEARN HOW TO DO THESE THINGS AND TO PERHAPS
THEY WILL HAVE TO SHOW MORE CREATIVITY IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TALON WELFARE LAST WORD ON THAT WELL I THINK WE DO NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF RISKS I THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD BE IN A SENSE THINKING ABOUT NOT NOT OBSESSIVELY WORRIED ABOUT IF YOU LIKE SUPER INTELLIGENCE BUT CERTAINLY MINDFUL AND CONCERNED TO BUILD IF YOU LIKE ETHICS INTO THE PROCESSES OF DESIGN OF THESE SYSTEMS PROFESSOR ALAN WINFIELD AND PROFESSOR BARBARA HACKING AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A CLASS GETS TO DO THIS MORNING IS MONA SIDDIQUI HE'S PROFESSOR OF ISLAMIC STUDIES AT NEW COLLEGE AT THE AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING MANY YEARS AGO A BRITISH DIPLOMAT TO PAKISTAN TELL ME OF THE MILLIONS HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN THE CAR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY OVER THERE
IN HIS VIEW IT WAS A GOOD TRADE LINK BUT ALSO CAPACITY BUILDING I SUGGESTED THAT RATHER THAN INVEST ONLY IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WHY NOT PUT SOME MONEY INTO THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES IN COUNTRIES WERE DEVELOPMENT WAS STILL AN ONGOING CONCERN
HE THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTERESTING IDEA BUT THE POOR COUNTRIES NEEDED INVESTMENT FROM VOCATIONAL TRAINING RIO JOBS TO GET THE ECONOMY GOING AND ARTS AND HUMANITIES WERE MORE ABOUT SELF INDULGENCE
TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAVING A SIMILAR CONVERSATION AS PART OF THEIR AMBITION TO MOVE UP THE INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE TABLES WHY NOT EXPAND THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES SPACE IN UNIVERSITIES
ONE SENIOR AUTHORITY IN THE EMIRATES SAYS WE HAVE THE BEST ENGINEERS THE BEST ARCHITECTS DENTISTRY EVERYONE WANTS TO COME HERE
HE LOOKED AT ME AS IF TO ASK WHAT WAS THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES AD
HIGHER EDUCATION ISN'T ABOUT POLARISING THE SCIENCES FROM THE ARTS A FUTILE AND DAMAGING BINARY FOR ALL OF US WHO CARE ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION TRYING TO CREATE A BETTER SOCIETY ISN'T A DISCIPLINE IT'S A MORAL COMMITMENT
BUT IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE THERE ARE FEWER INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL FREEDOMS LESS PLURALISM WHERE THE SPIRIT OF CRITICAL INQUIRY KNOWLEDGE FOR KNOWLEDGE SAKE HE'S SEEN A SUSPECT WHAT IS CONSIDERED A REAL EDUCATION MATTERS
IF THERE IS LITTLE OR NO PLACE FOR LITERATURE ETHICS IN PHILOSOPHY SUBJECTS WHICH TAKE US INTO OUR OURSELVES OPEN OUR MINDS TO HUMAN DIVERSITY AND CULTURAL RICHNESS THROUGHOUT HISTORY THAN ANY SOCIETY INCLUDING OUR OWN IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING INTELLECTUALLY AND EMOTIONALLY CLOSED
THE REAL VALUE EDUCATION IS ABOUT SEEING ALTERNATIVES CHALLENGING EVERY DAY PRACTICES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO PROVOKE US NOT ONLY TO THINK ABOUT WHO WE ARE BUT WHO WE MIGHT BECOME AS INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIETY
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT IS IT TO BE HUMAN IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS WITHOUT EXPECTING ANY DEFINITIVE ANSWERS
GROWING UP I WAS ENCOURAGED TO SAY THE PRAYER GOD INCREASE MEAN MY KNOWLEDGE THE PRAYER IS ABOUT DESIRE FOR LEARNING NOT A PLEA FOR ANSWERS
INVESTING IN THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES IS ABOUT INVESTING IN A FULLER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD AND BEING ABLE TO SEE OUR HISTORIES AND CULTURES THROUGH A MORE CRITICAL LENSE
WITHOUT THIS LENS KNOWLEDGE CAN SO EASILY SLIP INTO CONVICTION AND TRIUMPHALISM AS CAN BE SEEN IN THE RISE OF INTOLERANT TO RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALISM WAS THIS CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE
IT SEEMS TO ME RATHER THAN ME RATHER THAN BEING VIEWED AS A LUXURY A HOLISTIC EDUCATION WHICH CREATE SPACE FOR CRITICAL THINKING SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED AS FUNDAMENTAL TO COEXISTENCE AND PEACE
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH MONA SIDDIQUE IS THE TIMES NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT MATTHEW GARNET IS BEING HELD IN AN EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC WARD IT BECAUSE HE ASSAULTED HIS FAMILY HE'S FIFTEEN HAS AUTISM AND BECAUSE HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM THINKS HE'S IN PRISON
HIS FAMILY SAY THEY KEEP BEING TOLD BY N.H.S. ENGLAND THAT HE WILL BE MOVED TO A MORE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT UNIT BUT HE'S NOW BEEN THERE SIX MONTHS HIS FATHER ROBIN GARNETT IS IN A RADIO CAR GOOD MORNING TO YOU MISTER GARNETT
MORNING AND YOU AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND EXPECTED HIM TO BE THERE A FEW DAYS YES OUR UNDERSTANDING WAS AFTER HERE TO ATTACKED TO SWITCH WAS EARLY SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR IT CLEARLY WASN'T A CRIMINAL CASE
AND THAT THE OAK THE ONLY OPTION OFFERED TO US WAS A SECTIONING WHICH SO WE WE AGREED TO THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY THING WE COULD BUT OUR ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THAT WAS A TEMPORARY HOLDING MEASURER FOR PROBABLY A MATTER OF DAYS WEEKS AT THE MOST AND THEN HE WOULD MOVE TO THE THE APPROPRIATE PROVISION WE NEVER DREAMT IT WOULD BE HALF A YEAR WHAT DID HE DO WHAT IS HE LIKE AND WHAT DID HE DO THAT YOU'RE IN THIS SITUATION
HE HAS OR HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM WHEN IT'S VERY YOUNG ONLY MUCH MORE RECENTLY THAT HE'S HAD A DISTRAUGHT DIAGNOSES OF A.D.H.D. GENERALISED ANXIETY I'M REALLY THAT ANXIETY AND DISTRESS HAS JUST GROWN
OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS I'D SAY AND HE'S KIND OF REVERTED TO FIGHT OR FLIGHT MODE AMOUNT KIND OF LED TO A SERIES OF ATTACKS IT'S CULMINATED IN
YEAH QUITE A QUITE A BAD ATTACK ON MYSELF MY WIFE AND SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR SO THEN HE WAS TAKEN INTO THIS PSYCHIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COULD YOU TAKE HIM OUT IF YOU WANTED TO
WELL UNDER SECTIONING IS IT'S VERY HARD I I HAVE SOME RIGHTS AS I THINK THEY CALL IT THE NEAREST RELATIVE BUT ESSENTIALLY IT'S SO I CAN APPEAL THINGS AND DISAGREE BUT I WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH
PROCESSES WHERE WHERE THE DOCTORS COULDN'T CAN ARGUE THE OPPOSITE AT ANY POINT SO SO NO IT'S IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OUT OF THE SYSTEM ONCE YOU'RE IN IT AND YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT A PLACE HAS BEEN FOUND AT HIT FOR HIM SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU WANT HIM TO BE A PLACE CALLED SAINT ANDREWS BUT IT'S RIGHT HE JUST NEVER HE HAS NEVER BEEN MOVED THERE DESPITE THE VARIOUS PROMISES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE
YES SO THERE'S BEEN A STATEMENT THIS WEEKEND'S CONFIRMING THAT HE WILL BE MOVED THERE BUT NOT CONFIRMING HER DATES THAT'S NOTHING NEW WE THEY REFER WAS WAS AGREED BY ALL PARTIES BACK IN SEPTEMBER SO THE FACT WE COULD BE DERMOT HE'S NOT BEEN IN DISPUTE IS LITERALLY THE BEDS ARE BLOCKED THERE'S WE BELIEVE THERE'S NOW SIX YOUNG PEOPLE
AT SAINT ANDREWS WAITING TO MOVE ON TO THEIR APPROPRIATE PROVISION AND MY SON HAS SPENT HALF A YEAR LITERALLY JUST WAITING FOR ABOUT IT'S THAT SIMPLE OH CLAMP HEARTBREAKING AND AND HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE THE EFFECT ON HIM HE'S WHAT
AND IF YOU THINK OF HER IF YOU THINK HE WAS LIKE A FIVE YEAR OLD
IT'S MY HEART IT'S A WHOLE KING FIFTEEN YEAR OLD YOUNG ADULT BUT PETE HE KIND OF SEES A WORLD LIKE A FIVE YEAR OLD SO FOR HIM HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S THERE HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HE'S ILL IN ANY WAY HE SEES ILLNESS AS A PHYSICAL THING
SO THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SENSE OF A BUILDING HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE IN WHERE THE DOORS ARE LOCKED AS THAT HE MUST BE IN PRISON SO HE HE SEES IT AS A PUNISHMENT FOR FOR WHAT HE DID SIX MONTHS AGO
AND WHEN YOU SPEAK TO THAT INPUT AS FAR AS THE N.H.S. IS CONCERNED ARE YOU SYMPATHETIC IN THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO BECAUSE THERE ARE NO BEDS IN THE PLACE THAT HE'S BEEN ALLOCATED
I THINK IT'S HARD SO WE'VE NOT HAD ANY DIRECT CONTACT WITH N.H.S. ENGLAND'S AT ALL IN SIX MONTHS IT'S VERY HARD TO TRACK DOWN WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE FOR THESE THINGS WHEN WE'VE ASKED THE PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTANT IN CHARGE OF MATTHEW'S CASE FOR CONTACT DETAIL THEY'VE THEY'VE REFUSED TO GIVE IT OUT SO IT SEEMS THEY'D NOT REALLY INTERESTING TALKING TO PARENTS IN CASES LIKE THESE SO WHO ARE YOU SPEAKING TO WHO GETTING INFORMATION
IT'S VERY HARD SINCE A PETITION AND ATTENTION HAS BEEN ON THE CASE WE STARTED HAVING CALLS FROM PEOPLE THAT WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE WE STARTED GETTING CALLS RETURNED BY PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T IN THE PAST WE'VE HAD SOME HEALTH CONVERSATIONS
LOCAL AUTHORITY HAVE GOT INVOLVED I THINK THE FIRST TIME AND THEY SEEM TO BE PUSHING VERY HARD TO GET PEOPLE TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND MOVE THINGS ON SHOULD BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THEY HAD SAID YOU PUT A PETITION ON CHANGE DOG OR ORGAN IT'S NOT UP TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SIGNATURES FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE SYMPATHETIC AND UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD SIMILAR SITUATION
YES I THINK WE WE FELT WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING AFTER HALF A YEAR AS PARENTS YOU WANT TO HELP YOUR CHILDREN SO THAT WAS THE ONLY THING WE CAN THINK TO DO THEIR RESPONSE HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING AND HUMBLING I THINK WE FELT WE WERE KIND OF BEEN ON HER OWN IN THERE
SEEING SUCH A RESPONSE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL FOR US WERE ALSO HEARTBREAKING TO REALISE THERE'S LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE GOING THROUGH VERY SIMILAR SITUATION
ROBIN GARNETT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US ABOUT THAT THANK YOU
THE TIME THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT PETER GIVES US HERE WITH THE WEATHER THANKS JUSTIN GOOD MORNING STILL FEELS LIKE WINTER NOW OUT THERE BUT IT WILL FEEL MUCH MORE LIKE SPRING BY THE END OF THE WEEK COULD SEE TEMPERATURES AS HIGH AS FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN DEGREES TODAY STILL DEFINITELY A CHILL IN THE AIR WINDS BLOWING IN FROM THE NORTH HAVING SAID THAT ACTUALLY MOST OF US WILL END UP WITH A DRY DAY WITH SOME GOOD LONG SUNNY SPELLS BUT THERE WILL BE A FEW EXCEPTIONS TO THAT CLOUDY SKIES AT THE MOMENT ACROSS WALES
RUNNING DOWN TO DEVON AND CORNWALL THAT'S A CLOUD BRINGING A FEW SHOWERS AS WELL IT'S BEEN GIVING SOME SNOW OVER HIGHER GROUND BUT THAT WILL TEND TO FADE AWAY THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON WITH SOME BRIGHTER SPELLS COMING THROUGH HERE AS WELL AND AFTER A RATHER CLOUDY DAMP START ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND I THINK HERE TOO WE SHOULD GET SOMETHING A BIT BRIGHTER
FOR THE AFTERNOON SHOWERS THOUGH NEAR NORTH SEA COASTS OF ENGLAND ALWAYS THERE OR THEREABOUTS THROUGH TODAY THEY WILL TURN MORE TO RAIN SLEET OR SNOW BY THIS AFTERNOON WITH THEIR MUCH OF SCOTLAND THOUGH STAYING DRY AND FAIRLY SUNNY THROUGHOUT MOST TODAY APART FROM THE FAR NORTH WEST WE JUST FIND SOME CLOUD AND PATCHY RAIN TEMPERATURES GENERALLY ACROSS THE U.K. RANGING FROM FIVE TO EIGHT DEGREES A FAIRLY WIDESPREAD FROST FOR A TIME TONIGHT THEN RATHER CLOUDY WITH SOME PATCHY RAIN TO COME FOR TOMORROW
PETER THANK YOU VERY MUCH LATER THIS MORNING WOULD YOU FOR PRESENTS SEAMUS HEANEY'S FINAL WORK READ BY IAN MCKELLEN
PART OF YOU IT'S TIME I HEARD YOUR STORY SEAMUS HEANEY'S FINAL WORK HIS TRANSLATION OF VIRGIL'S EPIC STORY OF INDIA'S TAKE YOU WITH HER SWORD FROM YOUR HSC
GO AHEAD ON THE ROAD NOW WE WERE SPLENDID BEEN TESTED
NOW NOW YOUR COURAGE MUST
READ BY IAN MCKELLEN IF YOU WILL AND MUST GO THAT FAR
UNDERSTAND WHAT ELSE YOU MUST DO SEAMUS HEANEY'S EARED BOOK SIX ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR THIS MONDAY TO FRIDAY MORNING AT NINE FORTY FIVE
IN THE NEXT HOUR OF THIS PROGRAMME THE MAN CREDITED WITH TEACHING FORTY MILLION CHILDREN TO PLAY PIANO WILL BE PLAYING FOR US AND ZAMMO FROM GRANGE HILL ON MINTING NANCY REAGAN AND THE JUST SAY NO DRUGS CAMPAIGN YOU'RE LISTENING TO THEIR RADIO FOUR SIR MONTAGUE AND JUSTIN WEBB
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE SEVENTH OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING A SUMMIT OF E.U. LEADERS WILL ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THE MIGRANT ROUTE THROUGH THE WESTERN BALKANS IS NOW CLOSED BRITAIN ASCENDING PATROL BOATS TO DETER PEOPLE SMUGGLING BETWEEN TURKEY AND GREECE A SENIOR EXECUTIVE AT THE FRENCH FIRM E.D.F. HAS REPORTED HE'D RESIGNED WARNING THE PLANS TO BUILD TWO NUCLEAR REACTORS IN BRITAIN COULD RUIN THE COMPANY
SO THE FARM SITES ARE TO BE TURNED INTO HAVENS FOR ENDANGERED BIRDS AND RAY TOMLINSON THE MAN WHO DREAMT UP EMAIL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE HAS DIED IN THE UNITED STATES B.B.C. NEWS READ THIS MORNING BY CHARLES
BRITAIN IS SENDING AN AMPHIBIOUS LANDING SHIP AND TWO OTHER VESSELS TO THE AEGEAN SEA HER AS PART OF A NATO MISSION TO STOP PEOPLE SMUGGLERS TAKING MIGRANTS FROM TURKEY TO GREECE THE SHIP WHICH CARRIES A HELICOPTER IS EXPECTED TO START OPERATIONS IN THE COMING DAYS SPOTTING SMUGGLERS AND PASSING THE INFORMATION TO TURKISH COAST GUARD SO THEY CAN INTERCEPT THE BOATS THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON TOLD US THE AIM WAS TO END FURTHER MISERY AND LOSS OF LIFE
THE FIRST THING IS TO BUILD UP A PICTURE OF THESE ROOTS AND TO START BREAKING THE SMUGGLERS BUSINESS MODEL SMUGGLERS ARE MAKING MONEY OUT OF PEOPLE DROWNING NOW WE'VE HAD SEVERAL HUNDRED DROWNED THIS WINTER SEVERAL THOUSAND DROWNED THIS YEAR AND WHAT'S ESSENTIAL IS TO WORK OUT WHERE THIS SMUGGLING IS PEOPLE SMUGGLING WAS DONE FROM THEM AND TO GET A POLICY IN PLACE OF RETURNING PEOPLE WHICH IN THE END WILL STOP PEOPLE MAKING THIS VERY VERY DANGEROUS CROSSING
THE DEPLOYMENT COMES AS E.U. LEADERS GATHER IN BRUSSELS FOR A SUMMIT WITH THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER TO TRY TO CUT SIGNIFICANTLY THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS ARRIVING ON THE GREEK ISLANDS A DRAUGHT SUMMIT COMMUNICATE HE SAYS THE MIGRANT ROUTE THROUGH THE WESTERN BALKANS IS NOW CLOSED I'LL CORRESPONDENT MARK LOWE AND REPORTS FROM A KEY TURKISH CROSSING POINT FOR MANY MIGRANTS HEADING FOR THE E.U.
FROM THE SHORE HERE IN CHESHIRE IT'S LESS THAN FIVE MILES TO GREECE AND THE DESPERATE ARE STILL MAKING THE JOURNEY TWO THOUSAND REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ARE REACHING THE GREEK ISLANDS EVERY DAY THE E.U. WILL PRESS TURKEY TODAY TO HALF THAT NUMBER BY CLAMPING DOWN ON SMUGGLERS AND INCREASING PATROLS HOPING TO HOLD TRAGEDIES LIKE YESTERDAY WHEN AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE DIED AS A BOAT SANK SOUTH OF HERE
ANKARA WILL BE PRESSED TO RE ADMIT ECONOMIC MIGRANTS DEPORTED FROM THE E.U. WITH PLANS AND RETURN TO RESETTLE IN EUROPE SOME REFUGEES ALREADY IN TURKEY THERE ARE CONCERNS IN BRUSSELS ABOUT ROLLING OUT THE RED CARPET FOR THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER JUST AFTER HIS GOVERNMENT TOOK OVER THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST NEWSPAPER AND TEAR GASSED PROTESTERS A SIGN OF A PERCEIVED AUTHORITARIANISM THAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY A PROBLEMATIC PARTNER
BUT IF THE E.U. IS TO STAND ANY CHANCE OF REDUCING THE NUMBERS FROM ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND OR SO WHO'VE ALREADY ARRIVED THIS YEAR TURKEY IS CRUCIAL AND IT SEEMS CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATE OF TURKISH DEMOCRACY WILL BE LARGELY GLOSSED OVER OUR CORRESPONDENT GAVIN LEE HAS BEEN WATCHING THE LATEST ARRIVALS OF MIGRANTS ON THE GREEK ISLANDS
THERE ARE JUST FIVE NAUTICAL MILES BETWEEN WHERE I'M STANDING ON THE COASTLINE OF HEELS TOWN ONE OF THE FIVE ISLANDS WERE MOST OF THE REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ARRIVE AND THE TURKISH COASTLINE THE BEACHES OF
AND ON THIS PORT WE'VE SEEN AROUND A DOZEN SMUGGLERS' BOATS SMALL RUBBER DINGHIES COME IN SINCE THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING THE DYNAMICS HAVE CHANGED HERE THOUGH WHEN I WAS HERE SIX MONTHS AGO THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES ON THE ISLAND NOW THERE'S MORE ORDER
THERE'S MORE CONTROL AS ONE MAIN PROCESSING SIDE IS CALLED A HOT SPOT WHERE PEOPLE ARE IDENTIFIED THEY HAVE THEIR FINGERPRINTS TAKEN AS BEST AS POSSIBLE THEY STAY THERE AT THOSE CONSIDERED REFUGEES GO ONTO THE MAINLAND WE KNOW
NO THEY GO FURTHER NORTH IT'S A BOTTLENECK AT THE MOAT IN MACEDONIA WHERE VERY FEW GO THROUGH AND THOSE CONSIDERED ECONOMIC MIGRANTS ARE SENT TO ATHENS DETAIN
A SENIOR EXECUTIVE OF THE FRENCH ENERGY GIANT E.D.F. OFFICE REPORTED TO HAVE RESIGNED IN A DISPUTE OVER ITS PLANS TO BUILD A NUCLEAR PLANT AT HINKLEY POINT IN SOMERSET IT'S THOUGHT THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER THOMAS BICKNALL ARGUED THAT PUSHING AHEAD NOW WOULD PUT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE AT RISK IT WAS OUR INDUSTRY CORRESPONDENT JOHN MOYLAN
JUST LAST WEEK AT AN ANGLO FRENCH SUMMIT DAVID CAMERON AND FRANCOIS LAWNED CONFIRMED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE HINKLEY POINT PROJECT NOW ACCORDING TO REPORTS FROM PARIS E.D.F.'S CHIEF FINANCE OFFICER HAS RESIGNED AFTER EXPRESSING CONCERNS THEY'RE GOING AHEAD WITH THE PLANT NOW WOULD JEOPARDISE E.D.F.'S FINANCIAL SITUATION
THE TWIN REACTORS PLANT FRANKLY POINT WILL COST EIGHTEEN BILLION POUNDS AND WHILE SOME OF THAT WILL BE PAID BY E.D.F.'S CHINESE PARTNERS THE FRENCH ENERGY GIANT WILL STILL HAVE TO FIND BILLIONS OF POUNDS AT A TIME WHEN ITS OWN FINANCES ARE STRETCHED
E.D.F.'S REVENUES HAVE BEEN HIT BY FALLING POWER PRICES IT NEEDS TO SPEND TENS OF BILLIONS UPGRADING AGEING NUCLEAR PLANTS IN FRANCE IT'S TWO NEW PLANTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN FRANCE AND FINLAND ARE ALSO BOTH WAY OVER BUDGET AND BEHIND SCHEDULE
THE F. HAS INDICATED THAT A FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION ON HINKLEY POINT WILL BE MADE THIS YEAR BUT ONE OF THE FRENCH UNIONS HAVE SEATS ON E.D.F.'S BOARD RECENTLY TOLD B. B. C. AT THE HINKLEY POINT PROJECT SHOULD BE DELAYED DOCTOR PAUL DORFMAN FROM THE ENERGY INSTITUTE AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON TOLD US IT WAS NOW HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT E.D.F. WILL BE IN A POSITION TO CONFIRM THE PROJECT IS GOING AHEAD IN A STATEMENT DO YOU NEXT MONTH
JOHN LONGWORTH HAS RESIGNED AS THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE FOR PUBLICLY SUPPORTING A U.K. EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION DURING A SPEECH LAST WEEK IN A STATEMENT RELEASED LAST NIGHT THE PRESIDENT OF THE B. C. C. NORA SENIOR SAID NO POLITICIAN HAD INFLUENCED THE DECISION THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE NORTH EAST CHAMBERS OF COMMONEST COMMAS JAMES RAMSBOTTOM TOLD THIS PROGRAMME IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION
BECAUSE WE WERE NOT GOING TO CAMPAIGN ON EITHER SIDE AND THAT JOHN WAS DOING SO THAT YOU KNOW JOHN THEN TOOK THE RIGHT STEP TO ULTIMATELY RESIGNED AT THE MOMENT THAT JOHN WAS GIVING HIS SPEECH IT WAS VERY VERY CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT WAS INVOLVED WITH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT THIS WOULD BE THE OUTCOME
THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN SET OUT PLANS TO CHANGE WHAT SHE'S CALLED AN OUTDATED INEFFICIENT AND UNFAIR SCHOOL FUNDING SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AT THE MOMENT SCHOOLS WITH A SIMILAR MIX OF CHILDREN CAN RECEIVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF FUNDING PER PUPIL DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE IN THE COUNTRY MORE DETAILS FROM OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
NICKY MORGAN SAID SCHOOL FUNDING WAS BASED ON ODDITIES OF HISTORY AND NO LONGER REFLECTED REAL NEED SHE GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF ROTHERHAM WHICH RECEIVES FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS MORE PER PUPIL EACH YEAR THAN PLYMOUTH TO SPITE SIMILAR LEVELS OF NEED
MISSUS MORGAN SAID LOCAL NEEDS HAD CHANGED DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS SIGHTING LINCOLNSHIRE WHERE THE PROPORTION OF PUPILS ELIGIBLE FOR FREE SCHOOL MEALS HAVE DOUBLED AND SOUTHWARK WHERE IT HAD NEARLY HALVED TEACHING UNIONS CLAIMED THAT THEIR PLANS HAS OUTLINED IN THE CHANCELLOR'S AUTUMN STATEMENT WOULD MEAN A REAL TERMS DECREASE IN SCHOOL BUDGETS
PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND IS URGING PEOPLE TO ADOPT HEALTHY HABITS IN MIDDLE AGE TO DOUBLE THEIR CHANCES OF GOOD HEALTH IN OLD AGE RESEARCHERS SAY LIFE EXPECTANCY IN THE U.K. IS AT A RECORD HIGH BUT THE NUMBER OF YEARS PEOPLE LIVE FREE OF ILL HEALTH HASN'T KEPT PACE PROFESSOR KEVIN FENTON FROM PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND SAID IT WASN'T AN ATTEMPT TO HECTOR PEOPLE BUT TO GIVE THEM THE LATEST INFORMATION AND SAVE THE N.H.S. MONEY
OF COURSE THE EVIDENCE IS CHANGING EVERY DAY SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE UPDATE THE KEY MESSAGES THAN EVIDENCE SO PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS RISKS AND A NUMBER OF HEALTH OUTCOMES THESE BEHAVIOURS RESULT IN CONDITIONS WHICH COSTS THE N.H.S. NEARLY ELEVEN BILLION POUNDS PER YEAR SO THIS IS A VERY SMALL INVESTMENT BUT THROUGH THIS WE CAN HAVE A NEW ENGAGEMENT AND EMPOWERING AND INFORMATIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BUT STEPS THAT THEY CAN TAKE TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH
SOLAR FARM SITES ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES ARE TO BE DEVELOPED INTO NATURAL HABITATS FOR THREATENED SPECIES OF BIRDS SUCH AS SKYLARKS AND LAPWINGS THE JOINT PROJECT BY THE R.S.P.B. AND THE GREEN TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND ESCARGOT IS DESIGNED TO CONSERVE WILDLIFE BLIGHTED BY INTENSIVE FARMING MORE DETAILS FROM JOHN IRONMONGER
THIS CONSERVATION PROJECT IS AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE STEEP DECLINE OF FARMLAND BIRDS AS TREES AND HEDGEROWS ARE WIPED OUT BY INTENSIVE FARMING METHODS NUMBERS OF TURTLE DOVES AND TREE SPARROWS IN PARTICULAR HAVE DWINDLED BY AROUND NINETY PER CENT OVER THE PAST FORTY YEARS
IT'S HOPED SEED RICH PLANTING IN THE SPACES BETWEEN PANELS AT LARGE SOLAR FARMS WILL HELP TO REPLACE GLOSS BIRD HABITATS WHILE ATTRACTING BEES BUTTERFLIES AMPHIBIANS AND OTHER ANIMALS THE R.S.P.B. SAYS IT WILL ADVISE AN S. GO ON HOW BEST TO PROVIDE FOR THESE PRIORITY SPECIES AT SITES INCLUDING CORNWALL YORKSHIRE AND ANGLESEY
THE MAN CREDITED WITH THE INVENTION OF EMAIL THE AMERICAN RAY TOMLINSON HAS DIED HE WAS SEVENTY FOUR HE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SENDING ELECTRONIC MESSAGES FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER ACROSS NETWORKS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IN A SPEECH YEARS LATER HE SAID HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING BUT HAD NO NOTION WHATSOEVER OF ITS ULTIMATE IMPACT FROM SAN FRANCISCO HERE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA TECHNOLOGY REPORTER STAVELY
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED BILLION EMAILS WILL BE SENT AROUND THE WORLD TODAY BUT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE THE FIRST WAS SENT BY RAY TOMLINSON TO RAY TOMLINSON HISTORIC STEP THAT WOULD CHANGE THE VERY NATURE OF HUMAN COMMUNICATION
HIS INNOVATION WAS TO COMBINE TWO EXISTING SYSTEMS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SEND MESSAGES FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER TO SIMPLIFY THIS PROCESS HE DECIDED TO COMMANDEER THE AT SYMBOL THEY KEY THERE AT THE TIME WAS BARELY USED BUT IS NOW UBIQUITOUS
IN THE DECADES THAT FOLLOWED MANY INNOVATIONS HAVE PROMISED TO BRING ABOUT THE END OF THE EMAIL BUT NONE HAVE EVER SUCCEEDED IN BETTERING TOMLINSON'S REVOLUTIONARY WORK DAVE LES REPORTING THE TIME TEN PAST EIGHT HERE AS THE HORRIBLE CONUNDRUM THAT THE LEADERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE TO CONFRONT IN THEIR CRUNCH MIGRATIONS SUMMIT MEETING WITH THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT TODAY THEY NEED TURKEY ON BOARD THEY CANNOT SOLVE THIS WITHOUT
TURKISH CO OPERATION AND YET THEY REGARD TURKEY AS AN UNRELIABLE PARTNER AT BEST A NATION NOT FULLY COMMITTED TO EUROPEAN VALUES ONLY THIS MORNING THE LAST HALF HOUR OR SO THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THE RECENT CLOSURE OF AN OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER IN TURKEY WAS UNACCEPTABLE SO WHAT TO DO ABOUT TURKEY WITH PRESIDENT HAD ONE REPORTEDLY THREATENING TO SEND MORE MIGRANTS INTO EUROPE IF HE DOESN'T GET WHAT HE WANTS SHOULD THE E. USE ADMIT TO HIS DEMANDS
OR STAND FIRM AND ACTUALLY HASN'T TURKEY GOT A DECENT CASE TO MAKE THAT IT HAS BEEN TREATED RATHER POORLY IN A MOMENT WE WILL HEAR THE TURKISH VIEW FROM THEIR DEPUTY AMBASSADOR TO LONDON FIRST THOUGH TO A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS WHO SPENT THE PAST WEEK INCREASE
COME ON FELLA THIS IS THE RECEPTION CENTRE OR HOT SPOT ON THE ISLAND OF LES BOSS WHERE REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS COME WHEN THEY FIRST ARRIVED IN EUROPE IN A SLIGHTLY DISORGANISED GAME OF VOLLEYBALL GOING ON JUST BEHIND ME AND IT'S NOTABLE THAT ADMITS THE EXHAUSTION AND THE WORRY YOU SEE HERE THERE IS ALSO OPTIMISM THEY FINALLY ARRIVED
ISN'T EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD AFGHAN WHO'D BEEN TRAVELLING FOR MORE THAN A MONTH NOW FROM KABUL WITH HIS FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BROTHER I'M SO HAPPY IN HER I WANT TO GO AT MY BROTHER OF GARDENS AND AFTER THAT WE'VE GOT THE ARM AS A DOWN HERE AND AFTER THAT JERRY MONEY BUT HAVE YOU HEARD THAT THE BORDER IS CLOSED AT THE MOMENT INTO MACEDONIA BUT I KNOW THAT
BUT JUST MAYBE AT AUDLEY
AFGHANS IS CLOSED AND THE MOMENT RIGHT RIGHT THREE MOTORS THE GOODS OR MONEY AND LURK UNSEEN AND MY LETTUCE
BUT WHAT'S ALSO NOTABLE IS THAT THE OPTIMISM DOESN'T ALWAYS LAST LONG THIS IS ATHENS PEOPLE BEING SHEPHERDED ONTO A BUS TO MOVE FROM ONE TEMPORARY CAMP TO ANOTHER AS BORDERS CLOSE AND EUROPE'S POLITICIANS PLAN A TOUGHER RESPONSE MANY HERE SENSED THAT THE WELCOME MAT IS BEING SLOWLY WITHDRAWN FROM HOMS IN SYRIA IS SITTING BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
HE'S BEEN HERE A WEEK HE'S DISCOURAGED AND HAS THIS ADVICE FOR REFUGEES YET TO ARRIVE IN GREECE IN THE SKIRL OF THE HARDER WE LOAD UP A LIP ON IT AND THE PLANNER RIGHT NOW I'D SAY DON'T COME
A LOT OF PEOPLE LEAVE FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR CHILDREN BUT IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THEM HERE AT LEAST IT'S SAFER THERE'S NO SHELLING BUT DON'T THINK YOU'RE LEAVING SO YOU CAN EDUCATE YOUR KID BUT OF COURSE IF THEY OPEN UP THE BORDER THAN EVERYTHING WOULD BE DIFFERENT
BUT THE RHETORIC IS CERTAINLY HEATING UP A MAN WHO WILL CHAIR TODAY'S SUMMIT DONALD TUSK SPENT MOST OF LAST WEEK ON THE ROAD TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS IN GREECE HE HAD THIS WARNING FOR ILLEGAL MIGRANTS DO NOT COME TO EUROPE DOES NOT BELIEVE THE SMUGGLERS
DO A LOT TO RISK YOUR LIVES AND YOUR MONEY IF THIS ALL FOR NOTHING AND IN TURKEY HE HINTED AT THE RESPONSE THAT'S IN THERE WORKS IF PEOPLE TRY TO KEEP ON COMING
IN EURO THEIR MOST PROMISING METHOD SEEMS TO BE A FAST AND LARGE SCALE MECHANISM TO SHIP BACK REGULAR MIGRANTS ARRIVING IN GREECE
THAT COULD MEAN ALL NON SYRIANS WHICH RAISES A VARIETY OF LEGAL AND MORAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REFUGEES AND ECONOMIC MIGRANTS AND WHEN IT'S SAFE TO SEND BLOOD
AND AT THIS CAMP YOU DO MANY ON THE GREEK MACEDONIAN BORDER SUGGESTIONS EVEN ASSYRIANS COULD FACE PROBLEMS MACEDONIA MAY ONLY LET PEOPLE TRAVEL NORTH IF THEY'RE FROM CERTAIN PARTS OF SYRIA BUT AND MORE WAR TORN THAN OTHERS
WHETHER THEN SARB AGE TO HEAR GOD ALI MUST STAFFORD HAS BEEN ON THE BOARD OF SIXTEEN DAYS NOW WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO KIDS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO IF THEY SENT ME BACK TO TURKEY HE SAYS IT WAS HARD LIVING THERE
AND I DON'T WANT TO I'M GOING TO WAIT HERE HE'LL SEE I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK I'M GOING TO WORK
THAT'S ONE LESS FORCE EVERY DAY BRINGS MORE NEW ARRIVALS THERE IS NO OFF SWITCH YOU CAN CLOSE BOARDERS GET NATO TO PATROL THE SEAS BUT STILL THEY WILL COME NESTLE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH REFUGEES HERE AS A VOLUNTEER FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS AND HE HAS THIS MESSAGE FOR EUROPEAN LEADERS IN US SEEING WHAT HAPPENS REALLY YEAH BECAUSE I THINK THEY DO
THEY SEE ONLY NUMBERS IF THEY SEE ONLY PROBLEMS BUT WE HAVE TO DO
HUMAN BEINGS SO PEOPLE OF COURSE SUE PEOPLE IF TO BABIES
SO THEY MUST COME HERE TO SEE TO FEEL HOW WAS IT
BUT IN EVERY COUNTRY POLITICIANS ARE UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF THIS MIGRATION CRISIS IT IS EUROPE'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE AND NOTHING WILL RESOLVE IT QUICKLY WELL I WAS CHRIS MORRIS IN GREECE I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO GEM ISSUE WHO IS THE TURKISH DEPUTY AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K. AND HE BEGAN BY TELLING ME ABOUT THE DEPTH OF THE CRISIS THAT HIS COUNTRY WAS FACING
ACCORDING TO THE U.N. TO RICKY HAS BECOME THE BIGGEST REFUGEE HORSING COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED SYRIANS UNDER TEMPORARY PROTECTION TURKEY IS NOW TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND SYRIANS ARE ACCOMMODATED IN TWENTY FIVE TEMPORARY PROTECTION CENTRES
AND HER PROVIDED WITH FOOD NON FOOD ITEMS HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICES AS WELL AS PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSISTANCE AND ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH HELP FROM THE WELL WE SPENT MORE THAN EIGHT BILLION U.S. DOLLARS AND THAT'S JUST FOR THE SYRIANS ARE IN THEIR TEMPORARY PROTECTION CENTRES THIS IS NOT INCLUDE A FREE EDUCATION AND THE HEALTH CARE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE CITY'S WRITE ME A PROMISED YOU THREE BILLION IN IN EUROS IN HELP YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S NOT NEARLY MATCHING WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY SPENT
WELL FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE POCKETS OF IN TURKEY'S POCKETS IT'S GOING TO GO TO THE TO THE TO THE SYRIANS DIRECTLY AND THIS HAS THE AMOUNT THAT'S THAT'S COME IN FROM THOSE THREE BILLION EUROS IS
IS NEGLIGIBLE SOFA REALLY BECAUSE THE MONEY'S BEEN PROMISED HASN'T IT YOU'RE SAYING HE'S NOT TURNING UP WELL IT HAS BEEN PROMISED BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS AND A LOT OF MONEY WHAT ABOUT OTHER FORMS OF HELP THE E.U. HAS TO ACTON IN COHESION AND THE E.U. HAS TO WORK IN UNITY WAS TURKEY
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT TURKEY CANNOT SOLVE ALONE THERE MUST BE SHARING HER BURDEN AND RESPONSIBILITY NOW THERE WAS A THERE WAS AN TURKEY E.U. SUMMIT LAST NOVEMBER THAT SUMMER THERE WAS A JOINT ACTION PLAN THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT GOES MUCH FURTHER THAN ILLEGAL MIGRATION OR RE ADMISSION
THERE COMMITMENTS FOUGHT FOR TURKEY COMMITMENTS FOR THE E.U. INCLUDING THE THREE MANIA IS THAT YOU MENTIONED THESE THESE MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN FOR THESE COMMITMENTS AND THESE ARE COMMITMENTS FOR NON VISA TRAVEL BETWEEN TURKEY AND THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR THE REEVE IFICATION OF TURKEY'S EFFORTS TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S WHAT YOU TALK IT INCLUDES THAT AS WELL YES BUT THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNREALISTIC ISN'T IT WILD TURKEY
PUTS JOURNALISTS IN PRISON AND BEHAVES AS IT HAS DONE RECENTLY TO MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION THERE IS NO PROSPECT IS THAT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BECOMING COSIER WITH TURKEY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO IS IN PRISON FOR EXAMPLE FOR IT FOR IT FOR
WHATEVER PURPOSES YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THERE FOR HIM FOR A MURDER THERE PEOPLE AND THEREFORE ESPIONAGE YEAH I'M SURE THEY'RE NOT CHARGED WITH JOURNALISM BUT THE FACT IS THAT YOU HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF JOURNALISTS IN PRISON AND REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS WORLD PRESS FREEDOM INDEX PUTS TURKEY AT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINTH AMONG ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY COUNTRIES THAT HE'S DEEPLY UNFREE THE THERE'S NO JOURNALIST IN PRISON
A BIT BITTER BECAUSE OF THE JOURNALISTIC ACTIVITIES TO RICKI THAT TURKEY HAS TAKEN A LOT OF REFORMS INCLUDING THE DIFFER INCLUDING THE CLEANING IN THE AREA OF FREEDOM OF PRESS AND
I CAN I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE MANY REFORMS THAT ARE BEING UNDERTAKEN IN TURKEY THE THE THE RATS HAD AN OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER SEIZED AND ITS POLICIES CHANGED IN THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY FREE I JUST I'M MAKING THE POINT THAT FOR TURKEY TO BE SERIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT JOINING THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE CHANGES AT HOME WHICH ACTUALLY THE TURKISH PRESIDENTS CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE WILLING TO COUNTENANCE
TURKEY TURKEY TURKEY JOINING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS A STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES AND THE LIKE I CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR YEARS THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON TURKEY AS A MEMBER STATE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T WANT PROBLEMS RELATING TO IRAQ AND SYRIA AT ITS BORDERS NOW YOU CAN SEE HOW SHORT SIGHTED THAT VISION WAS HIS TURKEY BLACKMAIL IN EUROPE
YOUR TURKEY IS NOT BLACKMAILING YOU ARE BULLETS BUT IT'S DISHEARTENING TO SEE THAT TURKEY HAS THAT THAT EUROPE HAS REMEMBERED TURKEY ONLY OUT OF THAT OF THE MIGRATION CRISIS LAST SUMMER THERE IS A PRACTICAL ISSUE HERE THERE AS WELL ISN'T IT THAT THAT WERE THE EUROPEAN UNION TOO
GET CLOSER TO TURKEY PERHAPS WITH VISA FREE TRAVEL ET-CETERA IT WOULD THEN RISK IMPORTING ALL THESE PEOPLE
AT THE MOMENT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS TRYING TO KEEP OUT OF EUROPE AND IN TURKEY SO THAT THAT THERE IS A PRACTICAL REASON WHY WOULDN'T DO IT
IT'S TO BE THAT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE BECAUSE I SUPPOSE THEY DID THESE ARE MIXING APPLES AND ORANGES TOGETHER ONE OF THEM IS ILLEGAL MIGRATION AND TURKEY'S DONE A LOT TO STAND THAT YOU KNOW WE WE WE HAVE WE WE HAVE
A LOT OF THE COASTGUARD FOR EXAMPLE IN PLACE TO STOP THAT ILLEGAL MIGRATION WE HAVE WE WE WE WE HAVE A STRONGER BORDER BORDER BROUGHT BORDERS DO CHECKS WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE DEPLOYED TO THE BORDERS
TURKEY'S THREAT STILL STAND AND IT WAS A THREAT MADE BY PRESIDENT HAD A RUN AT THAT SUMMIT WASN'T IT HE AND THAT YOU REFERRED TO THE END OF LAST YEAR A THREAT TO SIMPLY OPEN THE DOORS AND IF IF NEGOTIATIONS DON'T GO WELL THEN YOU'LL JUST SENT PEOPLE OVER IN LARGE NUMBERS
BUT THAT DOES NOT HAVE THREATS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE A THREAT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT REALISTIC FOR US FA FA FA FA FA OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS TO ASK US TO TO OPEN OUR SOUTHERN BORDERS FOR HUMANITARIAN PURPOSES BUT CLOTHES OUR CLOTHES OUR EASTERN BORDERS FOR MIGRATION PURPOSE THAT'S THE NUB OF IT ISN'T THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE ASKING ME TO DO
WELL TURKEY HAS RICHARD SO IT HAS A TRADITION THAT GOES BACK TO THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY OF PROVIDING A SAFE HAVEN FOR FOR THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN FLEEING FROM PERSECUTION REGARDLESS OF THEIR RELIGION RELIGIOUS ETHNIC OR LINGUISTIC BACKGROUNDS TURKEY CANNOT CLOSE ITS DOORS TO PEOPLE IN NEED OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO RICKY'S EXERTING EVERY EFFORT TO TO MINIMISE IRREGULAR MIGRATION
WE WE WE HAVE THROUGH JOINT OR A SINGLE OPERATIONS INTERCEPT AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IRREGULAR MIGRANTS WE HAVE SAVED NINETY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE
FROM THE SEA ALONE AND THAT'S JUST LAST YEAR I THINK PEOPLE RECOGNISE THAT THAT TURKEY HAS DONE QUITE A JOB OF WORK IN THIS BUT AT THE SAME TIME PRESIDENT UNDER ONE TO ONE WAS QUOTED AS SAYING WE CAN OPEN THE DOORS TO GREECE AND BULGARIA ANY TIME AND PUT THE REFUGEES ON BUSES THAT SOUNDS LIKE A THREAT
WE TOOK HIS TURKEY IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO TO TO TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TRICKY CANNOT DO THIS A LOT TURKEY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AND SO IF YOU CAN'T SOLVE A CYLON GENOSHA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THIS MORNING
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE FRENCH ENERGY GIANT E.D.F. HAS CONFIRMED THIS MORNING THAT ITS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER THOMAS PICK AMMA HAS RESIGNED FROM THE COMPANY THEY ACTUALLY MADE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT TO THE ROLE
HE RESIGNED IT'S UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE HE WAS FEARFUL OF WHAT THE COMPANY'S DECISION IF IT WENT AHEAD TO BUILDING A NEW REACTOR AT HINKLEY POINT WHAT IT WOULD DO TO ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OUR BUSINESS EDITOR COME ON AHMED IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU COME ON
I MEAN THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY I RECKON ON A HUGELY IMPORTANT DECISION FOR BRITAIN ALSO THIS IS BEAMER SAGA THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SO MANY YEARS NOW AND I SORT OF MORE CHAPTERS IN IT THAN WAR AND PEACE THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE POWER PROJECT IN THE WORLD THE DECISION TO BUILD A NEW POWER STATION AT HINKLEY POINT IN SOMERSET EIGHTEEN BILLION POUNDS IT WILL COST
IT WILL NOT START PRODUCING POWER FOR A DECADE AND IT HAS BEEN LONG PLANNED AND FRANKLY LONG DELAYED INTERESTINGLY THOUGH HERE
MY WAS A WELL KNOWN CRITIC OF THIS SCHEME AND IT APPEARS THAT HIS RESIGNATION HAS BEEN SPARKED FOLLOWING THE MEETING BETWEEN DAVID CAMERON AND FRANCOIS ALONG LAST WEEK WHERE AGAIN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT BOTH GOVERNMENTS WANTED TO BACK THIS DEAL THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IS AN EIGHTY PER CENT STAKE HOLDER OWNER OF E.D.F.
AND FRANKLY THE PEOPLE I'VE SPOKEN TO THIS MORNING HAVE SAID IF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S GOING AHEAD IT IS GOING AHEAD WHATEVER THE CRITICISMS OF THE COST WHATEVER THE IDEA THAT IF WE JUST BUILT GAS FIRED POWER STATIONS THAT WOULD BE BETTER QUICKER AND CHEAPER WAY OF ENSURING THAT WE KEEP THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE U.K. WHATEVER THOSE ARGUMENTS AREN'T THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE COMMITTED AS IS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO THIS PROJECT GOING AHEAD AND THEREFORE IT APPEARS IT IS GOING AHEAD WITHOUT MY PICK HIM UP O.K. I MEAN IT'S THE ROLE OF A FINANCE OFFICER OBVIOUSLY TO SAY LOOK THIS IS FOR THEIR FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES HERE BUT IF YOU HAVE THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BEHIND A. COMPANY AND EFFECTIVELY GUARANTEEING IT DOES IT MATTER
WELL THAT'S THE POINT HAS BEEN MADE TO BE THIS MORNING THAT FRANKLY PEOPLE WITHIN THE BUSINESS THE COMPANY E.D.F. CAN HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE TAKING ON THE HUGE AMOUNT OF DEBT THEY NEED TO FUND THIS PROJECT BUT IF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT DECIDES THAT E.D.F. IS NOT ONLY GOING TO BUILD THIS NEW TYPE OF NUCLEAR POWER STATION IN THE U.K. DESPITE PROBLEMS OF SIMILAR TYPE OF POWER STATION IN FRANCE ITSELF AND IN FINLAND
THAT IT IS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT THEY'VE SIGNALLED THAT E.D.F. CAN SELL ITS STAKE IN THE FRENCH NATIONAL GRID CAN SELL POLISH POWER STATIONS AND ALSO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN TAKING DIVIDENDS OUT OF E.D.F. HAVE STARTED BUYING SHARES SO THEY ARE HELPING E.D.F.'S CASH POSITION BY BUYING SHARES THEMSELVES OR THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL DESPITE THE CONTROVERSY IS THAT HINKLEY POINT
SOME POINT POSSIBLY SARAH WHEN WE'RE STILL ALIVE BUILT

DAVID CAMERON SAYS THE ROYAL NAVY WILL JOIN A NATO OPERATION AGAINST PEOPLE SMUGGLERS IN THE AEGEAN SEA IN THE COMING DAYS HE MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN ADVANCE OF THE SUMMIT TODAY INVOLVING Y. YOU HEADS OF GOVERNMENT AND TURKEY TURKEY'S DEPUTY AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K. GEMMA SHEK TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT THE E.U. HAD PROMISED A LOT OF MONEY TO HELP TURKEY RUN CAMPS FOR REFUGEES BUT HAD SENT ONLY A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT SO FAR
SHARES IN THE FRENCH ENERGY GIANT E.D.F. HAVE FALLEN SHARPLY BY EIGHT PER CENT IN EARLY TRADING BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF PLANS TO BUILD A NEW NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN SOMERSET HAD BEEN CONFIRMED THAT THE COMPANY'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER HAS RESIGNED APPARENTLY BECAUSE HE FEARED THE PROJECT COULD THREATEN E.D.F.'S FINANCIAL POSITION
THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE JOHN LONGWORTH HURST RESIGNED AFTER PUBLICLY SUPPORTING A BRITISH EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION A B. C. C. STATEMENT SAYS NO POLITICIAN INFLUENCED THE DECISION AND MINISTERS HAVE SET OUT PLANS TO OVERHAUL THE SCHOOL FUNDING SYSTEM IN ENGLAND WHICH ALLOCATES MORE MONEY TO SCHOOLS IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAN OTHERS LOCAL AUTHORITIES AREN'T TO BE REMOVED FROM THE PROCESS ALL SCHOOLS IN FUTURE WILL BE FUNDED CENTRALLY
HEY CHARLES IT IS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE IS THERE LIFE ON MARS WE'RE GOING TO GET A CLOSER LOOK ADD A DEFINITIVE ANSWER WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY IS ROCKET IN JUST A WEEK'S TIME THE ROCKET IS ROMANTICALLY ENTITLE THE TRACE GAS ORBIT UP BUT NEVER MIND PROFESSOR ANDREW COATES IS FROM UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON'S MULLARD SPACE SCIENCE LABORATORY WHICH BUILT SOME OF THE CIRCUIT BOARDS FOR THE ORBITER AND HE'S BEEN FILLING ME IN ABOUT THE PRICE
THERE ARE TWO MISSIONS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE EXO MARS PROGRAMME THIS IS THE GREAT EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY YOUNG RUSSIAN MISSION SUCH ADMISSIONS SO THE FIRST ONE HE'S LOOKING FOR METHANE THE SECOND ONE IS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR LIFE SO WITH THEIR FIRST MISSION WE'RE LOOKING FOR METHANE ON MARS AND THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH ACTUALLY SHOULDN'T BE THERE ON MARS OR SHOULD BREAK UP INTO SUNLIGHT RELATIVELY QUICKLY SO THE FACT THAT IT'S THERE INDICATES THAT THERE'S A SOURCE THE SOURCE OF METHANE COULD BE TO DO WITH GEOTHERMAL ACTIVITY OR IT COULD BE TO DO WITH CURRENT LIFE
THAT'S A MISSION LOOKING REALLY FOR POSSIBLY THE POSSIBLE TWO CURRENT LIGHTFOOT MARS THE SECOND MISSION AYE SIR MILES TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT'S GOING TO DRILL UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE UP TO TWO METRES FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT'S THE ONE WHICH WE'RE BUILDING THE CAMERA SYSTEM FOR THE PAN COME INSTRUMENT THAT WILL DRAW UNDER THE SURFACE
UP TO TWO METRES THAT'S AS FORTY TIMES BETTER THAN PREVIOUS SPACECRAFT HAS DONE I'VE DONE BECAUSE CURIOSITY WHICH IS ON THE SURFACE AT THE MOMENT DRILL FIVE CENTIMETRES SO THIS IS GOING TO DRILL BELOW THE OXIDISING ENVIRONMENT AND THE HIGH RADIATION ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING ULTRAVIOLET ON THE SURFACE THAT'S REALLY NOT CONDUCIVE TO CURRENT LIFE BUT THAT SECOND MISSION IS LOOKING FOR SIGNS OF PAST LIFE AT THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION YEARS AGO WHEN MARS WAS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HAD LIFE AND SO
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING WITH BOTH MISSIONS FOR FOR LIFE ANYWHERE BEYOND ON THE METHANE ISSUE YOU DO YOU SAID IT COULD BE CAUSED BY GEOTHERMAL ACTIVITY RETHINK HER MA'S BEEN DESPERATELY COLD I MEAN IS IS IT LIKELY IT WOULD BE AN EXCITING RESULT IN ITSELF SO EITHER RESULT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S TO DO WITH GEOTHERMAL ACTIVITY COS WE DO THINK REALLY BUT MILES'S PRETTY MUCH DEAD NOT MUCH HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE IT LOST ITS HEAT OF FORMATION FROM EARLY IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM
VERY EARLY BECAUSE IT'S A SMALLER PLANET THAN EARTH EARTH KEPT THAT GOING AND KEPT ITS MAGNETIC FIELD GOING BUT MARS LOST ITS MAGNETIC FIELD AND AT THAT POINT THE ATMOSPHERE STARTED STRIPPING AWAY AND HE BECAME BASICALLY I'M HABITABLE AS FAR AS WE KNOW BUT CURRENTLY THAN THE MILES AS WE HAVE IT TODAY IS RELATIVELY COLD US ABOUT ZERO DEGREES ON ON THAT ON THE SUNLIT SIDE
BUT MINUS ONE HUNDRED TO MINUS HUNDRED TWENTY AT NIGHT AND SO THE INSTRUMENTS ON THE ROVER AND EVERYTHING HAVE TO SURVIVE ALL THAT THERE REALLY WERE LOOKING FOR US FOR SIGNS OF LIFE WITH THE ROVER WHICH WHICH WAS PERHAPS THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION YEARS AGO BEARING IN MIND THE AGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AS FOUR POINT SIX BILLION YEARS YEARS AGO AND SO THIS IS EARLY IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM'S HISTORY ARE YOU GOING TO SETTLE IT DO YOU THINK OF THESE THEN
TWO MISSIONS ALLIED MISSIONS GOING TO SETTLE I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT WE WERE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE IN THE CASE OF THE METHANE WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHERE THAT IS COMING FROM THE SEASONAL VARIATION AND BASICALLY TYING IT UP WITH WATER UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE WITH A SECOND MISSION LOOKING FOR LIFE
IT HAS ALL THE POSSIBILITIES YOU KNOW WHO LAND IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND ARE ABLE TO DRIVE OVER TO THE PLACE WHERE WHICH IS RIGHT ARE WE WE ANALYSE THAT WITH THE CAMERA SYSTEM AND ALSO WITH SUBSURFACE SOUNDING INSTRUMENTS TO LOOK AT WHERE HE'S GOOD ROCK OUTCROPS CROPPED UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE SO FOR IN THE RIGHT PLACE WE MAY WELL DISCOVER IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS LIFE ON MARS PROFESSOR ANDREW COATES FROM YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINE THE CHINESE CONCERT PIANIST LANG LANG IS SO SUCCESSFUL AND POPULAR THAT HE IS CREDITED WITH ENCOURAGING FORTY MILLION CHILDREN IN CHINA TO LEARN THE PIANO
HE'S NOW HOPING TO BRING THE LANG LANG EFFECT HERE HE'S PRODUCED A SERIES OF PIANO BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AND IS HOPING TO CONVINCE BRITISH CHILDREN THAT CLASSICAL MUSIC IS COOL AND TO CONVINCE THEIR PARENTS THAT MUSIC EDUCATION MATTERS TO EVERYONE BUT I HAVE MOVED TO A DIFFERENT STUDIO IN BROADCASTING HAS WON WITH A PIANO AND WITH ME HERE IT'S LIKE THAT GOOD MORNING TILL MORNING MORNING SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE LANG LANG PIANO METHODS THAT SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE WAY THAT YOUNGSTERS LEARN TO
WE ARE TRYING TO INSPIRE THE KIDS TO LEARN MUSIC IN A VERY ENJOYABLE WAY AND SO WE HAVE MADE THIS KIND OF A CHARACTER AND THE CHARACTER OF TEN ACTUALLY TEACHING THEM HOW TO PLAY THE SUPERHERO SONG HOW TO PLAY
THEY'RE BUREAU FOR KIND OF DRAGON BALD SONG AND THEN HOW TO KIND OF INSPIRED BY A FAMOUS EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE PAST FROM TODAY AND I WAS ALWAYS EATING THE SPACE SO WE'RE USING THEIR THERE BASICALLY AT ALL OF
AND ASPECTS IN OUR LIFE OR OUR OUR CHILDREN'S ALIVE AND THEN WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE THAT I STUCK KUNG TURNED LEG BEING SCALES BEING POWDERY THE CHORDS AND WE INSPIRED CHILDREN TO PRACTISE IN THE MORE HE MADE YOU MADE IT FOR ME OH KAY OF COURSE THE WAY THAT YOU LEARNT COS YOU STARTED PLAYING PIANO WHEN YOU WERE THREE AND YOUR FATHER FAMOUSLY I THINK WHEN YOU WERE NINE SAID YOU WEREN'T
GOOD ENOUGH SO YOU SHOULD KILL YOURSELF AND YOU WERE VERY PRESSURED THIS IS OF COURSE RATHER DIFFERENT YEAH I MEAN I HAD THIS PART BUT SAME TIME I ALSO WAS A BIG A FAN OF CHARACTER AND I REMEMBERED REALLY THEY'RE A LOT OF DIFFICULT TIME BED WON
CAN KIND OF PUT MYSELF INTO THE CHARACTER I SOMEHOW LOVE THE PLAY SO I WAS BORN IN JEWELS GEMINIS OR THIS WAY I THINK IN LIFE SOMETIMES I GET THE MORE YOU CAN SCREAM UNDER TO A SURFACE
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT ONE OF THINGS THAT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WAY YOU TEACH IS THAT YOU TRY TO TEACH CHILDREN TO USE TWO HANDS MUCH EARLIER THAN PERHAPS OTHER TEACHING METHODS WOULD YEAH I LIKE TO HAVE A BETTER BALANCE AND THE FORM HERE WAS A REALLY REALLY GREAT I HAD A GREAT TEACHER HALL TOLD ME A LOT HARDER FOR
AS A KID MAKE BACH FOR EXAMPLE AND ICE I REMEMBER THERE WAS A SUCH A GREAT TRAINING A DEMONIC BOTH BRAINS AND AND FOR ME THE BALANCING ISSUE HIS NEED TO BE SOFT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING O.K. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PLAY US THAT FOOT AS FAR AS FAR AS CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED IT'S DIFFICULT ASK YOU TO PLAY SOMETHING TERRIBLY SIMPLE COS IT'S DRILLS LIKE AN ABSURDITY
THIS KIND OF A CONCERT PIECE FROM OUR BOOK LABEL ONE AND A. IS CALLED THE CELEBRATION
I MET HIM BUT ONE
WHAT THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THEY CAN PLAY SOMETHING THEY FEEL IS A PROPER PERFORMANCE PRETTY A PRETTY EARLY WELL YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A KIND OF A TRAINING COURSE BEFORE AND THEN
AND THEN THEY HAVE A CONCERT PIECE TO PLAYS AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE IS KINDA DRAGON BOAT RACING
IT'S ALSO ONE OF CUTTER BUT BEFORE BUT AT JUST GOOD IT WORKS WE'VE GOT LIMITED TIME WE'RE HOPEFULLY GOING TO HEAR YOU WHERE WE WILL HEAR YOU PLAY BEFORE THE END OF THE PROGRAMME
YOUR ARGUMENT WITH THIS IS THAT THE ADVANTAGE ACTUALLY FOR ANYBODY BY LEARNING MUSIC IS THAT THEY DEVELOPED PARTS OF THEIR BRAIN THAT BENEFIT THEM IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN FOR ME WHERE THERE YOU'LL BECOME PIANO IST PROFESSOR LEE NUT BUT I STUDIED PIANO GAVE THE GREED JOY OF SHARING YOUR CREATIVITY AND
MUSIC CAN WE CUT ABBYA TYPE WRITER YOU KNOW I MEAN NOTHING WRONG THIS TYPEWRITERS BUT THE THING IS THE MUSIC WE NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING LIVE
ALF FROM THAT TO PIECES HE'S CRAZY HE'S A KIND OF COME FROM NOWHERE BUT THEN HIS SO PRESIDENT AND WE HARRY TIME WE NEED A GREEN THERE TROY BACK
TO EARTH TOOL TO THEIR LIVE PERFORMANCES AND THAT NEED TO BE INSIDE OFF THE FIRST YOU KNOW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LEARNING YOU NEED TO HAVE THEIR FEELINGS RIGHT AWAY
AND IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU WOULD PLAY THAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF PLAYING TO INSPIRE SOMEBODY TO SAY LOOK YOU START WITH THIS RELATIVELY SIMPLE THING YOU COULD END UP
DOING WHAT YEAH I'LL TRY AND DO THAT YOU READ THE BOOK BUT WE ALSO HAVE SO THAT I ACTUALLY RECORDED A LOT OFF THE CASTOR PIECES FOR THE KIT LIKE WHAT I BELIEVE HOLDS SAMLIN SHOULD BE ORANGE YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THE KIND OF INTERPRETATION THAT YOU CAN LEARN SOMETHING AWE INSPIRED
IN THE END OF THE DAY I WANT THEM TO HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME A PIANO IS ABOUT IN NEED TO BE COMMUNICATED AND NEED TO BE WE NEED TO LIVE A STAGE AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT I WANT THE KIDS TO FEEL
WELL FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL BE HEARING YOU PLAY JUST IN JUST BEFORE THE END OF THE PROGRAMME THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE EVERY DAY THIS WEEK WE'RE GOING TO BE ILLUSTRATING THE NEWS HEADLINES SO IF YOU GO TO OUR WEBSITE WHICH IS CLEARED UP TO U.K. SLASHED TODAY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND NEWS ILLUSTRATED ITS ANIMATED VIDEO AS A OF AN EXPERIMENT BRILLIANT TELLING THE NEWS IN A WAY THAT YOU WON'T HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE ANYWAY THAT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS WEEK AND THAT IS THERE AN UP AND RUNNING ALREADY NOW
TALKING NEW IDEAS THERE IS A SUGGESTION A VERY STRONG SUGGESTION FROM PROFESSOR ADAM GRANT TO IS A PROFESSOR AT THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS IN PENNSYLVANIA VERY VERY FAMOUS BUSINESS SCHOOL THAT WE ARE IN BUSINESS AND INDEED IN THE REST OF OUR LIVES NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH
TIME AND SPACE FOR PROCRASTINATION BECAUSE IT IS PROCRASTINATION THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE GOOD IDEAS THE BOOK IS CALLED ORIGINALS HOW NOW NONCONFORMIST CHANGE THE WORLD ADAM GRANT AS SIR ALAN GRANT IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU IT MIGHT TELL US ABOUT PROCRASTINATION BECAUSE WE'D BE SORT OF THAT TAKE IT OUT OF DAILY LIFE AS MUCH AS WE CAN YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD PUT IT BACK IT
I CERTAINLY HAVE SO I'M THE OPPOSITE OF A PROCRASTINATE OR I'M A PRE KRATZ INATOR I ALWAYS FEEL PRESSURE TO GET THINGS DONE EARLY YOU KNOW THAT PANIC THAT YOU FEEL A COUPLE HOURS MY DEADLINE WHEN YOU HAVEN'T PREPARED YEP EVERY MORNING YEAH GREAT I FEEL THAT ABOUT THREE MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF SOMETHING COSTLY RUSHING AHEAD TO GET THINGS DONE AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT WAY TO BE PRODUCTIVE THAT ONE DAY I HAD A STUDENT WHO CAME TO ME AND SAID YOU KNOW I HAD MY MOST CREATIVE IDEAS AND M. PROCRASTINATING AS LIKE THAT'S CUTE WHERE THE FOUR PAPERS
M. M. ANT BUT DID YOU THEN COME UP WITH EVIDENCE THAT ACTUALLY IN IN AREAS OF LIFE THAT ARE IMPORTANT PROCRASTINATION HELPS AND HAS HELPED IN THE PAST YEAH SHE STARTED GOING INTO A CUPPA COMPANY IT'S AND SURVEYING PEOPLE AREN'T HALF AND HE PROCRASTINATED
AND THEN GOT THE BUSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THERE WERE AND SURE ENOUGH TO PROCRASTINATE AS LIKE ME WERE LESS CREATIVE THAN PEOPLE WHO PROCRASTINATED SOMETIMES SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CHRONIC PROCRASTINATE AS WHO ARE ALWAYS PUTTING THINGS AFTER THE LAST MINUTE AND SHE SAID I DON'T KNOW THEY WERE AND THOUGHT MY SURVEY WE THEN WENT INTO THE LAB AND RAN SOME EXPERIMENTS AND IT TURNED OUT THAT IF YOU WERE GIVEN A IDEA GENERATION TASK AND INSTEAD OF DIVING READ INTO IT YOU PROCRASTINATED BY PLAYING MINESWEEPER SOLITAIRE FIRST YOU WERE SIXTEEN PERCENT MORE CREATIVE
REALLY YEAH THEY'RE THE IDEA OF STARTING EARLY BUT THEN DELAYING YOUR FINISH IS A GREAT WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE TIME TO INCUBATE AND ENCOURAGES YOU TO DO MORE DESERT IDEA CLAIM MEN IN IN YOUR BOOK NOT ONLY THAT THAT THIS WORKS IN COMPANIES BUT THAT SOME OF THE KIND A GREAT MOMENTS OF ON A HUMAN HISTORY REALLY MIND MARTIN LUTHER KING'S I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS THE MONA LISA OTHER EXAMPLES OF
WHAT PEOPLE JUST COMING THOSE GREAT ARTISTS COMING TO THE RIGHT DECISION THE MOTORIST AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT YES IN THE GREATEST SPEECHES A WORLD HISTORY WERE REWRITTEN AT THE LAST MINUTE SO THAT YOU HAD A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO IMPROVISE WHEN YOU'RE STILL AT STAGE AS OPPOSED TO GETTING THE SCRIPT SENSED OUR MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND DE VINCI HE SPENT SIXTEEN YEARS WORKING ON AND OFF AND THE MONA LISA
AND HE FELT LIKE A FAILURE BECAUSE HE WAS CONSTANTLY GETTING DISTRACTED HE WROTE IN HIS JOURNAL TELL ME IF ANYTHING EVER WAS DONE WE DIDN'T REALISE AT THE TIME THERE WAS SOME OF THE DE VERSIONS LIKE EXPERIMENTS AND ARTEX CHANGE THE WAY THAT HE MUDDLED LATE AND ULTIMATELY MADE HIM A BETTER PINNER AND HELP HIM BECOME THE REDSTARTS MAD HOW DOES A COMPANY HUDDLE ORGANISATIONS BUILD IT
INTO THEIR FUNCTION I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THEY TRIED TO ALLOW FOR MORE PROCRASTINATION IS TO REALISE THAT TO BE ORIGINAL YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE FIRST YOU JUST HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT AND BETTER AND THAT MEANS THAT STARTING PROJECTS IS REALLY USEFUL BUT SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO BE A SLOW TO FINISH ONE OF THEIR HABITS THAT I'VE ADAPTED ACTUALLY I'VE STARTED
LITERALLY IN MY RIDING STOP IN MID SENTENCE AND PUT SOMETHING AWAY FOR A FEW WEEKS WHICH IS AGONY BUT WHEN I COME BACK TO IT I HAVE ALL SORTS OF NEW IDEAS AND ELSA HAVE ENOUGH DISTANCE FROM IT TO WONDER WHO WROTE THIS GARBAGE AND I THINK THIS IS MORE OF US COULD DO IS TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO START SOMETHING BUT THEN WHEN HE'S PARTIALLY FINISHED WE'RE GONNA PUT IT AWAY AND COME BACK TO IT LATER BUT ADAM ROUND AUTHOR OF ORIGINALS ARE NON CONFORMISTS CHANGE THE WORLD THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S QUARTER TO NINE IN LONDON IS ONLY BUILDING HALF THE HOMES IT NEEDS AN EIGHT IN EVERY TEN OF THOSE NEW HOMES IS UNAFFORDABLE TO EIGHT IN EVERY TEN LONDONERS THE LONDON HOW'D HOUSING COMMISSION PART OF THE THINK TANK THE I.P. P. R. SAYS THAT IF WE'RE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THE MAYOR AND LOCAL COUNCILS NEED MORE PLANNING AND TAX POWERS THE GOLDEN AGE OF COUNCIL HOUSE BUILDING WAS BACK IN THE SIXTIES AND HIS PACK THEY CLIP THAT CAPTURES THE OPTIMISM OF THAT TIME
BEEN COUNTING DOWN DAYS ARE REALLY MODERN DEVELOPMENT A GROUP OF THIRTY NINE COUNTRY HOUSES ALL LOOKING ON FOR THE
MY PRESENT BETTER THAN THESE HOUSES ARE ALMOST LIKE UREA CENTRAL HEATING IS HIGH AND WARM AIR
AS A SERVING HATCH THERE COULD
AND IT ALWAYS THESE ARE FAMILY HARDLY BUILT AS AN EXPERIMENT
CAFE A PARFAIT CLIP THERE WERE THE CHAIR OF THE MUM HAS AND COMMISSION ORD CATHOLIC JOINED US HE'S ALSO CHAIR OF PEABODY ONE OF THE LARGEST AND OLDEST HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS IN LONDON GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING MORE PLANNING AND MORE TAX POWERS MEANING WHAT ONE MORE ABILITY TO TACKLE THIS HUGE PROBLEM THAT LONDON FACES IT IS A QUITE UNPRECEDENTED HOUSING CRISIS
THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A PROPERTY IN LONDON IS TWELVE TIMES THE AVERAGE SALARY WE HAVE PRICES NOW THERE ARE UP TO FORTY FIVE PERCENT ABOVE THE PRE CRASH PRICE SO WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS LONDON IS BEST PLACED TO LEAD THE RESPONSE TO THIS WHICH ULTIMATELY IS BUILDING MORE HOUSES
SO AND IT'S WHICH IS WHY YOU CALL FOR MORE PLANNING POWERS WHICH IS TO WHAT OVERRULE THE VARIOUS PLAYERS IN IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET SOMETHING BUILT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS THAT THE ISSUES OF LONDON ARE PARTICULAR TO LONDON AND IT NEEDS MORE ABILITY TO LEAD THE PROCESS ITSELF SO WE SAY THAT THE LONDON PLAN SHOULD BECOME THE PLAN FROM LONDON NOT JUST PART OF A WIDER NATIONAL PLANNING POLICY WE ALSO SAY THEY SHOULD HAVE POWERS TO
BORROW TO BUILD NEW PROPERTIES AND YES THEY'VE GOT TO BE OF GOOD QUALITY BUT I THINK WE'VE LEARNT FROM THE SIXTIES AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT AND DO THAT WELL I'LL GIVE HER TIME SOME CASES IT'S THE COUNCIL THEMSELVES THAT'S THE PROBLEM AND YOU'RE ARGUING THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE POWERS I THINK WHAT WE FIND AND WHAT WE DID FIND IN OUR REPORT WAS ACTUALLY THERE'S A BIG COMMITMENT AMONGST THE LONDON BARRISTER DO MORE HOUSING ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE IS
THEY CAN CHARGE AN ECONOMIC RATE FOR THEIR PLANNING SERVICES TO BIG DEVELOPERS AND THAT'S A MISTAKE IN MY VIEW WE SAY THEY MARE WITH THE LONDON BOROUGH SHOULD HAVE FLEXIBILITY ON THAT SO YES OF COURSE THERE ARE ALWAYS BE FRUSTRATIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS
MY ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE LONDON BOROUGHS GET THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEING THE EFFECTS OF IT EVERY DAY WITH THEIR RESIDENTS EVEN IF YOU WERE TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF HOUSES BUILT AND THEREFORE GET CLOSER TO WHAT IT NEEDED TO BE MUM YOU'RE STILL NOT MAKING THE RECONNECTION BETWEEN POP WHAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD AND THE COST OF THESE HOUSE WILL LOOK IT'S TAKEN US A WHILE TO GET INTO THIS POSITION AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE US A GOOD TIME TO GET OUT OF IT AND THE RIP THEIR WAY THROUGH THIS IS TO BUILD BOTH PRIVATE HOUSES
AND PUBLIC HOUSES WE NEED TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE RENT IN FACT WE SAY HALF OF THE NEW HOUSES IN LONDON OR TO BE AFFORDABLE RENT HOUSES THERE ARE ACCESSIBLE TO ORDINARY LONDONERS BUT IN A LOT OF DEVELOPMENTS THAT'S WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP IT'S THE ROW OVER WHETHER YOU'RE PROVIDING FIFTY PER CENT OFF FORTY PERCENT OR THIRTY PERCENT FOR WHAT ABOUT YOU YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ABOUT THAT WE GO FOR THESE A LONG PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS USING VERY EXPENSIVE LAWYERS AND CONSULTANTS WHO THEN GO ON THE OTHER SIDE
IN THE NEXT NEGOTIATION SO WHAT WE SAY HERE IS LET'S HAVE A STANDARD TARIFF ACROSS LONDON EVERYBODY SIGNS UP THERE EVERYBODY SOUNDS ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS THEN LORD CATHOLIC THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TONIGHT
AND NOW THE SYRIAN PEACE TALKS SHOULD RESUME IN GENEVA LATER THIS WEEK
