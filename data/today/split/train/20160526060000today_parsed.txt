FUTURE INCREASES IN PAYMENTS WOULD BE BASED ON THE CONSUMER PRICE INFLATION MEASURE WHICH IS USUALLY BELOW THE RETAIL PRICES INDEX USED CURRENTLY MY WEB SAID RUSH TO LEGISLATION COULD LEAD DOWN A DANGEROUS PATH HERE OUR BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK
THE FIFTEEN BILLION POUND FUND AND IT'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUND DEFICIT HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF UNEASE FOR CURRENT OWNERS TARTAR AND A DEAL BREAKER FOR ANY WOULD BE BUYERS PRODUCING ITS BURDEN WOULD MAKE A SALE EASIER AND MAY EVEN CONVINCED TARTARE TO HANG ON TO ITS U.K. STILL BUSINESS FORM PENSIONS MINISTER STEVE WEBB HAS DESCRIBED THE IDEA AS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
BUT UNION LEADERS ARE LIKELY TO ACCEPT THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS A BETTER DEAL THAN SEEING THE PENSION SCHEME PLACED INTO THEIR PENSIONS LIFEBOAT FUND WHICH CAN SEE SOME MEMBERS LEAST TEN PER CENT OF THEIR PAY OUT IMMEDIATELY AND SEE LOWER INCREMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS

KEEPING ORDER PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL LONGER THAN NECESSARY CAN DAMAGE THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY AND IS EXPENSIVE BUT IT'S A GROWING PROBLEM LAST YEAR BED DAYS LOST IN THIS WAY AND ENGLAND REACHED ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION THAT'S MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT IN TWO YEARS AND THE N.A.O.

PHIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX AND HER LOOKING OUT TO THE NEWSPAPERS IT IS A PICTURE A SERIES OF PICTURES THAT TELL A STORY A VERY GRIM STORY FEATURED IN MANY OF THE PAPERS MANY OF THE FRONT PAGES THE MOMENT THAT A FISHING BOAT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN CAPSIZED AND ALL THE PICTURES ALL THE PAPERS CARRY WITH SIMILAR IMAGES
FIRST THE BOAT UPRIGHT THEN IT TURNING CAPSIZING AND THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ON BOARD SLIDING INTO THE SEA IT'S A VERY VERY GRIM IMAGE ULTIMATELY THE BOAT ENDS UPSIDE DOWN WITH JUST A FEW PEOPLE CLINGING TO ITS HULL AS THE REMAINDER IN THE WATER BEING PICKED UP
FOR THE MOST PART BY AN ITALIAN PATROL BOAT IT DOES SEEM DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ONE HUNDREDS ON BOARD THIS SHIP THAT THE DEATH TOLL MAY AT LEAST SO FAR HAVE BEEN FIVE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ARE MISSING BUT WE KNOW THAT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED JUST A BIT LESS THAN THAT WERE PICKED UP BY THE ITALIANS AND OF COURSE IT FOLLOWS AS THE SUN PUT SIT THE
THE NEWS THAT THE NAVY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN HAVE PICKED UP SIX THOUSAND FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS OVER MONDAY AND TUESDAY THAT MADE OF COURSE OFF THE COAST OF LIBYA THE TIMES HAS AN INTERESTING STORY FROM ITS CORRESPONDENT ANTHONY LLOYD IN LIBYA WHO SAYS THAT BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES FIRED A MISSILE TO DESTROY AN ISLAMIC STATE TRUCK PACKED WITH EXPLOSIVES IN LIBYA THIS MONTH THAT'S A QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE LIBYAN COMMANDERS INVOLVED WHO SAID THAT HE HAD HELP
FROM THE ENGLISH AS HE DESCRIBED IT IT IS SAYS THE PAPER THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF BRITISH SOLDIERS HAVE A COMBAT ROLE AGAINST I S. IN LIBYA WHICH WILL PROMPT CLAIMS FROM SOME M.P.S THAT PARLIAMENT IS BEING BYPASSED ANOTHER GOOD STORY IN THE TIMES AS WELL ON THE FROM PAGE CAMERON IS REALLY A FAN OR BRICKS IT SAYS HIS CLOSE FRIEND STEVE HILTON OF COURSE HAS BEEN AROUND HIS FORMER ADVISER AND FRIEND WHO TELLS THE PAPER
IF HE THAT'S THE PRIME MINISTER WAS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC OR A BACKBENCH M.P. OR A JUNIOR MINISTER EVEN A CABINET MINISTER I'M CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD BE FOR LIVE AS PRIME MINISTER HE SEIZED IT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
THE TELEGRAPH AS ONE OF THOSE TO PICK UP ON THE STORY OF HOW ICE SIS ISLAMIC STATE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE RECRUITING PEOPLE APPARENTLY USING THE KIT INTERNET CAT CRAZE TO LURE POTENTIAL JIHADISTS AND AND POTENTIAL WIVES AS AN IMAGE WHICH SAYS AT THE TOP HEY GIRLS AND THEN THERE'S A GUY POINTING TO A JAR OF NOT TELL US THING COME AND JOIN ISIS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE SOMEBODY A GUNMAN HOLDING THE KID
IT'S BEING FLAGGED UP BY THE U.S. ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL JOHN CARLIN SAYING THERE THEY KNOW THAT KITTENS
IT IS TEN PAST SIX THAT PICTURE STARES OUT FROM MANY FROM PAGES A PICTURE OF REFUGEES FALLING INTO THE SEA OFF THE COAST OF LIBYA WELL THE MESSAGE TO G.SEVEN LEADERS ARE MEETING AT A SUMMIT IN JAPAN THIS MORNING IS IF WE EITHER G. SEVEN DO NOT TAKE THE LEAD IN MANAGING THIS CRISIS NOBODY WELL THAT'S THE WORDS THOSE ARE THE WORDS
OF DONALD TUSK IS PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL AND IS JOINING THE LEADERS INCLUDING DAVID CAMERON GATHERING IN JAPAN WITH THEM IS A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE MORNING TO YOU JAMES HOW HIGH ON THE AGENDA IS THIS QUESTION OF MANAGING THE REFUGEE CRISIS
I THINK IT IS IT IS VERY MUCH ON THE AGENDA THERE'S NOT ONE OF THESE ISSUES THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED IN THE MARGINS OF THIS SUMMIT IT IS FORMALLY PART OF THE AGENDA LATER ON TODAY THE SPENDING THE MORNING TALKING ABOUT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BUT THEN THEY GET ON TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF WHICH SECURITY IN TERRORISM APART BUT CLEARLY MIGRATION CANNOT BE AVOIDED NOW AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE NOW IS AN ATTEMPT BY THE E.U. TO TRY AN INTERNATIONALISED THIS ISSUE DONALD TO US THIS MORNING WAS VERY EXPLICIT HE SAID
AID THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD NOT JUST PROVIDE MORE MONEY TO COUNTRIES THAT ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS HE CITED SPECIFICALLY TURKEY JORDAN AND LEBANON SO LOOK THEY ARE PROVIDING AN INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL GOOD THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY SHOULD PAY FOR THAT BUT HE ALSO SAID INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION SHOULD GET MORE INVOLVED PROVIDE NEW MECHANISMS OF FINANCING THIS THING HE ALSO SAID THAT THE WORLD COMMUNITY SHOULD LOOK AT FINDING NEW WAYS OF
SETTING UP INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ROUTES THROUGH WHICH MIGRANTS CAN MOVE AROUND COUNTRIES IN WAYS THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE IN THE PAST IN OTHER WORDS HE'S SAYING LOOK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT IT CAN'T JUST BE AN ISSUE OF I THINK CRISIS MANAGEMENT IN EUROPE
IS THERE ANY APPETITE AMONGST THE LEADERS TO TAKE ON A ROLE THE LEADERS PARTICULARLY HER NOT MEMBERS OF THE E. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN RELUCTANCE EVEN WITHIN THE YOU JAMES FOR COUNTRIES WERE NOT ON THE BORDERS DO NOT HAVE PEOPLE COMING TO THEM FROM THE SEA TO TAKE REFUGEES WHO THEY DON'T NEED TO TAKE
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SENSE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GET SOME KIND OF FORMAL AGREEMENT TO DO ANYTHING TODAY THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS AT THE SUMMIT THE WHAT TUSKS MY SAID WAS WHAT WE HOPED FOR IS AT LEAST SOME GOODWILL IN INDICATION THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE TRUST CAN BE INCHES WILLING TO TAKE UP I THINK CLEARLY
NOT ALL OF THEM HAPPEN AND IMMEDIATE DOG IN THIS PARTICULAR FIGHT BUT I THINK ALL OF THEM ARE AWARE OF THE HUGE INSTABILITY THERE POTENTIALLY THESE KIND OF ISSUES CAN CAUSE WHICH ARE GLOBAL CAUSED BY IT'S NOT JUST THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA IT'S ALSO ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES IN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA AND SO THEY HAVE A SENSE THAT THIS IS
AN ISSUE THAT CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON BEYOND BOUNDARIES SO I THINK THERE'S AN AWARENESS ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE WILLING TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE MONEY WELL WE WENT TO SEE JAMES UNDONE JAPAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'RE HOPING TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDER OF THE BOAT THE RESCUED SO MANY THOSE REFUGEES AND ALSO TO ITALY'S EUROPE MINISTER LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IT'S NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE H. S. TWO IS OVERPRICED MAYBE TOO FAST FOR ITS OWN GOOD ACCORDING TO A GROUP OF TRANSPORT EXPERTS ROGER KARABINERS OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER WHO IS THIS GROUP OF TRANSPORT EXPERTS WHAT ARE THEY SAYING
IT'S A GROUP OF ACADEMICS AND MANY OF THEM QUITE EMINENT MANY OF THEM RETIRED WHO SAY THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE RETIRED THEY CAN NOW TAKE A TRULY INDEPENDENT VIEW ON H. S. TWO THEY THINK THAT BROADLY SPEAKING A LOT OF ACADEMIA AND CONSULTANTS AND BIG BUSINESS HAVE BEEN SUCKED INTO THE GREAT CIRCLE AROUND H. S. TWO AND WILL BENEFIT FROM PROFITS AND THEY SAY THEY THINK THAT'S LED TO INSUFFICIENT SCRUTINY AND THEY'RE MAKING A FEW POINTS FIRSTLY ARE DUBIOUS ABOUT THE ROUTE ALTHOUGH THEY SUPPORT OUT HIGH SPEED RAIL THERE
DUBIOUS ABOUT THE ROUTE THEY THINK THE NEW LINE WILL HELP LONDON MORE THAN IT HELPS TO NORTH AND ONE THING AND YOU JUST MENTION THAT IN THE LEAD IN THERE THEY'RE ESPECIALLY CRITICAL DECISION BY H. S. TWO TO FUTURE PROOF THEIR TRACK IN THEIR TERMS BY BUILDING IT SO IT CAN TAKE SUPERFAST HIGH SPEED TRAINS RUNNING AT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES
AN HOUR NOW THAT'S MUCH FASTER THAN ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILES AN HOUR WHICH IS NORMAL FOR CONTINENTAL HIGH SPEED TRAINS WHICH COVER MUCH GREATER DISTANCES AND THE ACADEMICS IT SIMPLY CAN'T BE JUSTIFIED IN LITTLE LITTLE BRITAIN AND IT'S REALLY INCREASE THE COST AND CREE INCREASED CARBON EMISSIONS TO AND THOSE COSTS IN THE COMPARATIVE COMPARISON WITH THE WAY THE FRENCH DO THESE THINGS IS PHENOMENAL
I MEAN IT I REALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS YESTERDAY WHEN THE ACADEMIC SENT ME THEIR CALCULATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE COSTS AND I DIDN'T PLUG THIS STORY FOR FILM FOR MOST OF THE DAY BECAUSE I REALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS RIGHT BUT THE ACADEMICS ARE SAYING THAT FOR AN EQUIVALENT PIECE OF HIGH SPEED TRACK IN FRANCE H. S. TWO WILL COST FIVE TIMES AS MUCH
I PUT THAT FIGURE TO THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE LUNCH ELEVEN O'CLOCK IT TOOK UNTIL SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING TO GET A RESPONSE AND THAT RESPONSE WAS NO RESPONSE SO THEY DIDN'T RESPOND TO THE ALLEGATION THAT IT WILL COST FIVE TIMES AS MUCH ALTHOUGH THEY DO MAKE THE POINT IN THE ACADEMICS ACCEPT THAT LAND IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE U.K. IT'S MUCH MORE URBANISED BUT THEY SAY THE ACADEMICS SAY THAT PART OF THIS COST INCREASE IS BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA FAST RUNNING
AND THEY WANT THE THE WHOLE DISS YOU LOOKED AT BY AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY WHERE WE HOPE WE'LL GET A RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OR THE TECHNICAL DIRECTOR OF H. S. TWO AT HALF PAST SEVEN THIS MORNING ROGER THANKS VERY MUCH SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX NOW THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANNED CUTS TO BRITISH STEEL PENSION BENEFITS IN A BID TO SAVE TATA STEEL'S U.K. OPERATIONS
WARNINGS THIS MORNING THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR MANY PEOPLE WAY BEYOND THE STEEL INDUSTRY ROB YEUNG IS HERE WITH THAT AND THE REST OF MY MORNING YES GOOD MORNING AS TRYING TO SELL ITS LOSS MAKING YOU CAISTEAL BUSINESS MAKING WAS A VERY UNCERTAIN TIME FOR ITS ELEVEN THOUSAND WORKERS A BOARD MEETING OF THE COMPANY IN INDIA YESTERDAY FAILED TO COME UP WITH A LIST OF PREFERRED BIDDERS THE SALE PROCESS HAS BEEN MADE MORE DIFFICULT BY THE ALMOST HALF A BILLION POUND BLACK HOLE IN THE BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME SO LATER TODAY THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTED TO SAY
HE'S CONSIDERING CUTTING PENSION BENEFITS TO HELP SAVE THE COMPANY AND THE JOBS THAT THE PLAN IS ALREADY CAUSING UNEASE THE FORMER PENSIONS MINISTER STEVE WEBB HAS SAID THIS COULD TAKE MINISTERS DOWN A DANGEROUS PATH AND HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR WORK AS WELL BE ON THE STEEL INDUSTRY WILL WITH US IS THE INDEPENDENT PENSIONS EXPERT JOHN RALPH MORNING JOHN GOOD MORNING ROB SIMPLY WHAT MIGHT THESE CHANGES INVOLVE WELL LISTEN LET'S LOOK LET'S NOT GET TOO CARRIED AWAY AT THE MOMENT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THE DETAIL HAS ALWAYS THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAIL
I'M VERY CLEAR THAT WHAT WE DO KNOW HOWEVER DOESN'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL TO ALLOW TATA STEEL U.K. TO BE SOLD AS YOU SAID THERE'S AN ANNOUNCEMENT PENDING THERE ARE SEVERAL BIDDERS IN THE FRAME ARE THEY GOING TO TAKE ON THE PENSION SCHEME UNDER THIS QUOTES NEW ARRANGEMENT WELL NO THEY'RE NOT ANY MORE THAN THEY WERE UNDER THE OLD ARRANGEMENT SO I'M VERY CLEAR THAT THE ONLY ROUTE IS FOR THE PENSION SCHEME TO BE SEPARATED FROM
TALK TO STEAL U.K. FOR THE OPERATING BUSINESS IS TO BE SOLD FOR THEIR PENSION SCHEME THEN TO SORT OF WANDER AROUND AS A ZOMBIE SCHEME IT'S GOT TO HAVE A SPONSOR HOWEVER AND THE ONLY SPONSOR THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN IS THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW IT IS BUT IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS ONE OF THE CHANGES COULD BE CHANGING THE RATE AT WHICH PENSIONS ARE INCREASED EVERY YEAR FROM THE HIGHER RETAIL PRICES INDEX OF INFLATION TO THE LOWER CONSUMER PRICES
INDEX WHAT KIND OF A DIFFERENCE MIGHT THAT MAKE TO THE DEFICIT OF THE PENSION SCHEME AND AS FAR AS BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME IS CONCERNED IT IS AT THE MOMENT ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION LIABILITY IS IT WILL REDUCE THOSE LIABILITIES BY ABOUT TWO AND A HALF BILLION NOBODY'S GOING TO BE ANY MORE INTERESTED IN THE TWELVE AND A HALF BILLION POUND PENSION SCHEME THAN THEY ARE IN A FIFTEEN BILLION POUND PENSION SCHEME THE PENSION SCHEME WILL HAVE TO BE SEPARATED
THE GOVERNMENT COS I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY ELSE PREPARE TO DO IT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO STAND BEHIND IT THAT RAISES ALL SORTS OF PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES IT MAY WELL BE ILLEGAL UNDER EUROPEAN STATE AID RULES EVEN IF IT ISN'T WHY ON EARTH DOESN'T BUT HE STILL PENSION SCHEME HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE
ENTER THE FOCAL PENSION PROTECTION FUND WHICH IS WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE DOES WHY SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT SHOES TO GIVE THIS PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT WHY SHOULD THE TAXPAYER WHY SHOULD YOU AND ME ROB STAND BEHIND THIS PARTICULAR SCHEME IN THIS PARTICULAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND IF THIS IS A BROADER CHANGE A CHANGE THAT AFFECT MORE THAN JUST THE OLD BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME WHAT COULD THAT MEAN FOR FOR EVERYBODY ELSE WHO PAYS INTO A PENSION FUND IT'S GOT TO BE A BROADER THING
WE ARE GETTING RATHER CARRIED AWAY WITH OURSELVES I BELIEVE IN THE COCK UP THEORY OF GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN CONSPIRACY THEORY OF GOVERNMENT I DON'T BELIEVE AND I DON'T KNOW ANY INSIDE KNOWLEDGE I DON'T BELIEVE IT PEOPLE IN BUSINESS WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAVEN'T THEY'RE MAKING UP PUBLIC POLICY ON THE HOOF IN RESPONSE TO EVENTS WHICH IS NEVER A GOOD OUTCOME RIGHT AND SO IS SO IS STEVE WEBB RIGHT THEN THAT THIS IS A DANGEROUS MOOD I THINK I THINK STEVE WEBB IS EST IS SCAREMONGERING WE NEED TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS A PERMISSIVE CHANGE
IT'S NOT A BLANKET CHANGE THAT MEANS FROM A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME EVERYBODY CURRENTLY PAYING A P.I. COMPOSED C.P.I. IT MEANS THAT INDIVIDUAL TRUST THESE ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE CHANGES WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO GO TO COURT TO DO THERE RIGHT AND THERE PROBABLY HAVE TO GET REGULATOR APPROVAL TO DO THAT
IT'S NOT A BLANKET CHANGE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE COMPANY'S GOT TO BE ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU JOHN JOHN INDEPENDENT PENSIONS EXPERT FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE NEWS BUSINESS THERE'S A CALL THIS MORNING FOR INTERNET GIANTS TO HELP FINANCIALLY SUPPORT OLD FASHIONED JOURNALISM THAT THEIR WEBSITE LINKED TO THINK TANK PUBLIC ACCESS COMPANY SUCH AS GOOGLE SHOULD BE MADE TO PAY FOR THEIR KNEES THEY TAKE FROM OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS AND PROMOTE ON THEIR OWN WEBSITES WILL DOCTOR JUST INCH LOSS BERG GREAT TODAY'S REPORT AND HE'S GOT US GOOD MORNING
BRIEFLY TELL US HOW THE LEVEE WOULD WORK QUITE SIMPLE REALLY IT WOULD BE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THE REST PUPPY REPORT IS A SIMPLE LEVY ON REVENUES WHICH IS MUCH HARDER TO AVOID THEN PROFITS TAX AND IT WHICH COULD BE ADMINISTERED BY AN INDEPENDENT BOARD WITH THAT APPOINTMENT SYSTEM MODELLED ON SOMETHING THAT THE PRESS RECOGNITION PANEL WANT TO REGULATE THE INTERNET
NOT AT ALL WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS RECOGNISE THAT HUGELY PROFITABLE MEDIA BUSINESSES HAVE SOME MODICUM OF RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT SOME OF THE LEAST PROFITABLE FORMS OF JOURNALISM DORINDA ACUTE PRESSURE IN THE DIGITAL AGE ON THESE NEWSPAPER WEBSITES WHICH GET TRAFFIC FROM THE LIKES OF GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK ESSENTIALLY BENEFITING FROM FREE ADVERTISING FROM THESE ONLINE PLATFORMS
AH YES AND NO I THINK CERTAINLY THERE THERE IS AN ARGUMENT TO SAY THAT SOME OF THE BIGGEST NEWS BRIAN'S DEFINITELY BENEFIT TO SOME DEGREE OR IN SOME WAY FROM THE HUGE REFERRAL TRAFFIC THAT COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK GENERATE
BUT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF SMALL INDEPENDENT NEWS PLAYERS THERE ARE SUFFERING AND HIS JOURNALISM IS REALLY UNDER THREAT AND I THINK WHAT THE LEVY SHOULD SUPPORT HIS IS THOSE FORMS OF JOURNALISM NAMELY LOW CALL AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM THROUGH A WHOLE RANGE OF DIFFERENT VEHICLES
ISN'T THE REALITY THAT MANY NEWSPAPERS HAVE JUST FAILED INNOVATE THEY FAILED TO KEEP UP WITH CHANGING TECHNOLOGY UNLIKE ANY INDUSTRY THAT FAILS TO CHANGE WITH THE TIMES THAT WILL DIE OUT WELL I MEAN LET'S JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING THIS LOVERS LEVY IS NOT ABOUT PROPPING UP AN AILING BUSINESS OR INDEED NEWSPAPERS AS SUCH IT'S ABOUT PARTICULAR FORMS OF JOURNALISM THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE FOURTH ESTATE
WITHOUT THOSE OR WITH THOSE FORMS OF JOURNALISM UNDER PRESSURE THEN DEMOCRACY IS IN CRISIS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU DOCTOR JUSTIN SLOSS BURGER THERE WHILE THAT WE'VE BEEN HERE AT THE PRINT INDUSTRY HAS AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE THE NEW DAY NEWSPAPER CLOSED RECENTLY AFTER JUST TWO MONTHS IN CIRCULATION SO IT MIGHT SEEM AN ODD TIME FOR YET ANOTHER PRINT PUBLICATION TO BE LAUNCHED YET THERE IS A NEW TITLE AVAILABLE THIS MORNING IN LONDON IT'S CALLED SWIPE AND IT PROMISES TO BE THE BEST OF THE INTERNET IN PRINT
BONNIE GUYTON HE'S AT EDITOR IN CHIEF GOOD MORNING MORNING DO YOU HAVE LOTS OF MONEY THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LOSE
NOT AT ALL ACTUALLY BUT I THINK PRINT IS FAR FROM DEAD I THINK THERE'S A RECENT SURVEY FOUND THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE PREFER READING IMPRINT ACROSS ALL AGE RANGES AND SOME MAGAZINES ARE REALLY SUCCEEDING WITH CIRCULATION GROWING
SO I THINK IT'S THERE'S BEEN A FAVOURITE INNOVATORS IN A LOT OF PRINT PUBLICATIONS AND
PARTICULAR IN TERMS OF BUSINESS MODELS SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'VE COME UP WITH THEIR KIND OF INNOVATIVE EDITORIAL MODEL WHERE WE SOURCE CONTENT FOR OVER SEVENTY WEBSITES WE'VE GOT SIGNED
WHY WOULD I WANT TO READ SOMETHING IN PRINT ON A THURSDAY I PROBABLY READ ONLINE ON MONDAY WAS SUCH ENORMOUS VARIETY OUT THERE THAT I DON'T THINK YOU READ MOST OF THE STUFF IN SWIPE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SO MANY WEBSITE SIGNED UP AND LOTS OF SMALL PUBLISHERS LIKE SOME SOMEONE LIKE RATING KINGDOMS THAT SHE REALLY GREAT TRAVELLER REPORTING SITE SO THERE'S LOTS OF STUFF THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE MISSED
ON THE NORTH A LOT OF THE THAT THE BEST THINGS ONLINE BUT THEY'RE THE VIDEO CLIPS AREN'T THEY KNEW CLEARLY CANNOT TO PUT THESE IN A PRINT PUBLICATION SURE THAT'S TRUE BUT WE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT THE MAGAZINE TO BE BIGGER THAN JUST THE PAPER VERSION AS WELL PROVIDE KIND OF EASY WAYS TO GOOGLE THE VIDEOS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT ALSO THERE'S LOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT WRITING WHO REALLY GOOD JENS AND BEING DONE BY NATIVE PUBLISHERS AS WELL SO WHAT KIND OF RESEARCH HAVE YOU DONE TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS NOT ANOTHER PRINT FLOOR
WELL I MEAN WE ARE JOINING THE FREE MAGAZINE MARKET WHICH IS REALLY BOOMING IN LONDON AT THE MOMENT AND
YEAH I MEAN WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE GOING FOR A MILLENNIAL TARGET MARKET AND WE THINK THERE'S NO FREE MAGAZINES CURRENTLY AIMED SPECIFICALLY AT THAT SO WE'RE REALLY COMFORTING THAT THEY REALLY DON'T LIKE HE'LL BE AROUND IN A YEAR'S TIME
ABSOLUTELY OH KAY THANKEE BODY GUIDE TO THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF SWIPE A MARKETS GUESS THIS MORNING AS LAURA FALL THE U.K. EQUITY FUND MANAGER AT HENDERSON GLOBAL INVESTORS MORNING MORNING MOBILE PROVIDER THREE SAYS IT'S GOING TO RUN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR TRIAL IN THE U.K. WORK BLOCKS ALL ADS FOR ITS CUSTOMERS
THAT'S GOING TO UPSET AN AWFUL LOT OF ONLINE BUSINESS MODEL DOESN'T IT YEAH EXACTLY IT'S AN INNOVATIVE IDEA BUT I THINK IT WILL UPSET QUITE A FEW ADVERTISING AGENCIES AND COMPANIES THAT HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR THOSE ADVERTISING SLOTS ONLINE THAT IS REALLY
WHERE COMPANIES ARE MOVING TO TO ADVERTISE A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE SWITCHING ADVERTISING BUDGET AWAY FROM FREE TO AIR T.V. INTO ONLINE
IF THERE IS A MOVE TO BLOCK THESE THAT IT COULD BE QUITE DISRUPTIVE POPULAR WORSE WITH USERS HAVE WEBSITES PERHAPS YES EXACTLY I THINK YOU'LL BE POPULAR FOR CUSTOMERS I THINK THREE HAVE BEEN QUITE GOOD AT DOING IS IS
BEEN QUITE IN A BIT HE SAID THEY'VE ALREADY SWITCHED OUT OF ROAMING CHARGES IF YOU IF YOU TRAVEL INTERNATIONALLY SO IT'S QUITE GOOD FOR BUSINESS TRAVELLERS AND THIS IS QUITE A NEW IDEA SO WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT GOES REALLY LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRICE OF OIL IS NOW ABOVE FIFTY DOLLARS A BARREL FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR WHAT'S DRIVING IT UPWARDS AND IS IT GOING TO STAY ABOVE FIFTY DOLLARS I THINK IT CAN I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT YOU KNOW WE MEET A LOT OF OIL COMPANIES THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE HAD BEEN CUT
ACROSS THE LISTED OIL COMPANIES NOW HAS TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON SUPPLY AND WE ARE STARTING TO SEE SUPPLY OF OIL OUTSIDE OF OPEC COMING DOWN WHILE DEMAND HAS BEEN QUITE RESILIENT SO KNOW WHAT ECONOMICS WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE PRICE CAN GO UP IN IT HAS IT WAS BELOW THIRTY IT'S NOW AS YOU SAY GOT ABOUT FIFTY
SO I THINK IT CAN GO HIGHER ONCE WE GET TO ABOUT SIXTY DOLLARS THAT TENDS TO BE WHERE MOST OIL COMPANIES CAN START TO MAKE MONEY AGAIN SO THAT WOULD SUGGEST IT JUST A BIT MORE TO GO BEFORE YOU START TO GET BACK INTO THAT MORE COMFORTABLE PLACE FOR THE OIL COMPANIES WE SHALL GOT ALL COMPANIES ANNOUNCING JOB LOSSES WE HAD ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE IN THE NORTH SEA ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY BY SHELL DOES THAT SUGGEST THAT
THAT OIL COMPANIES AREN'T NECESSARILY CONFIDENT THAT THE PRICE OF OIL IS GOING TO CONTINUE UPWARDS I THINK WHAT YOU COULD SEE SHELL IS QUITE A UNIQUE CASE IN THAT IT BROUGHT B.G. SO IT'S INTEGRATING THOSE COMPANIES AND MAKING JOB LOSSES AS A RESULT BUT I THINK WHAT WE COULD SEE IS THAT THE OIL PRICE GOES UP AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A LOT OF OIL COMPANIES HAVE CUT COS YOU COULD THEN INTO QUITE A GOOD PERIOD FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY WERE COSTS HAVE BEEN CUT PRICES ARE GOING UP
AND VERY BRIEFLY LLOYDS BANKING GROUP THAT THE SHARES YESTERDAY PAST THE LEVEL AT WHICH TAXPAYERS BREAK EVEN ON THEIR STATE DOES THAT MEAN THAT GEORGE OSBORNE WILL TRY TO GET RID OF THEIR FINAL PUBLIC STEAK PRETTY SOON I WOULD EXPECT SO YES SO THAT WE CAN COMPLETELY BACK AND TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THE BANKING INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE HAS RECOVERED I'LL BE YES IT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MATTER THE DIFFERENCE WITH A B.

THERE ARE CALLS FOR RADICAL ACTION TO DEAL WITH DELAYS AND DISCHARGING PATIENTS ONCE THEY'RE READY TO LEAVE HOSPITAL THE SPENDING WATCHDOG THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY OLDER PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL WHEN THEY DON'T NEED TO BE THERE AND THE COST TO THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND THAT'S MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S INCREASING FUNDING TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM
A GROUP OF INDEPENDENT TRANSPORT EXPERTS HAS QUESTIONED THE DECISION TO DESIGN ENGLAND'S NEW HIGH SPEED RAIL NETWORK SO IT CAN SUPPORT TRAINS GOING AT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES PER HOUR THEY SENT MEANS THE SCHEME IS FAR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF TRAINS WERE RESTRICTED TO ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILES PER HOUR AND WILL RESULT IN HIGHER CARBON EMISSIONS AS SPOKESMAN FOR H. S. TWO TRAINS WERE GETTING FASTER THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND KEEPING THE SPEED LOWER WOULD NOT MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THE ENVIRONMENT
A U.S. GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG AS WARNED AT AMERICA'S NUCLEAR ARSENAL IS RELIANT ON OUTDATED COMPUTER SYSTEMS INCLUDING SOME THAT STILL USE FLOPPY DISKS THE PENTAGON SAYS THEY'LL BE GONE BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN CUT THE WORKERS' PENSIONS TO SAVE THEIR JOBS THAT AS WE WERE HEARING DURING THE BUSINESS NEWS
IS THE FORMULA THE GOVERNMENT'S EMBRACING IS IT TRIES TO FIND A BUYER FOR TATA STEEL AND ITS PORT TALBOT PLANT NORMAN SMITH JOINS ME NOW IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR WE CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT MINISTERS WILL UNVEIL LATER TODAY NO I THINK WE'RE PRETTY CLEAR YEP THEY ARE LOOKING AT BASICALLY CUTTING THE LIABILITIES OF THE TARTARE PENSION FUND BY ENSURING FUTURE INCREASES ARE NOT INCREASED IN LINE WITH THE RETAIL PRICE INDEX BUT WITH THE CONSUMER
PRICE INDEX AND I'M TOLD THEIR MOTHER LOOKING AT WHETHER THEY'LL MAKE A STATEMENT IN THE COMMONS I THINK I'LL CERTAINLY HAVE TO MAKE A STATEMENT BECAUSE LABOUR WILL I'M SURE SEE KWAN AND THE IS QUITE SIMPLY THIS THE PENSION LIABILITIES A MASSIVE MASSIVE DISINCENTIVE FOR ANY POSSIBLE BUYER BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST THE TATA STEEL WORKERS WHO IN THE PENSION FUND IT'S ALL THE BRITISH STEEL WORKERS WHO WERE THE SORT OF PRECURSORS OF TARTAR STILTON AND THE CONTROVERSY IS CREATED BECAUSE THIS REQUIRES A CHANGE IN THE LAW AND BE A CHANGE THE LAW THAT POTENTIALLY COULD AFFECT WORK AS LOTS OF OTHER SCAPED
THE KEY SORT OF RISK FOR MANY SORT OF CRITICS OF THIS IS THAT THIS IS NOT CONFINED TO TOTTER AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT GET INTO DIFFICULTIES CAN THEY SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO CUT A PENSION FUND TO SO WE CAN REDUCE THE BILL THERE THAN OTHER COMPANIES AND SAY WELL THAT'S NOT FAIR THEY'VE GOT AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE IN OTHER WORDS YOU CANNOT CONFINE IT TO TART AND THAT IS WHAT I THINK LABOUR AND THE UNIONS ARE LOOKING FOR SOME SORT OF GUARANTEE THAT THIS WILL BE LIMITED TO TATA
HAVE TO SAY IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR TO ME THAT EVEN DOING THIS WILL BE A SUFFICIENT TO GET POTENTIAL BUYERS ON BOARD BECAUSE IT IS STILL A HUGE HUGE LIABILITY AND NONE OTHER THAN THE FORMER PENSIONS MINISTER IN THE COALITION GOVERNMENT STEVE WEBB WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM HIM LATER TODAY IS SAYING DON'T DO THIS YOU'LL REGRET IT AND THERE IS ONE OTHER THING THIS IMPACTS ON THAT'S VERY DIRECTLY WHICH
OVERSHADOWS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WHICH IS A OLD FRIEND THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE GOVERNMENT ABSOLUTELY CANNOT AFFORD TARTARE TO GO BELLY UP BEFORE THE E.U. REFERENDUM NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE BAD PUBLICITY WITH THOUSANDS OF JOBS BEING LOST BUT BECAUSE AMONGST THE MOST PROMINENT DEMANDING THE GOVERNMENT DO SOMETHING HAVE BEEN PR EXIT M.P.S WHO POINTED THE FINGER OF BLAME AT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO ENSURE WE DON'T GET CHEAP
CHINESE STEEL IMPORTS DUMPED ON US NOT MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL HEAR FROM STEVE WEBB AND THE TRADE UNION REPRESENTING STEELWORKERS JUST BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK TIME IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN RYANAIR HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF BREAKING ELECTORAL LAW BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH IT SPENDING ON CAMPAIGNING FOR THE U.K. TO STAY IN THE E.U. ROSS HAWKINS HE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS THIS IS NORMALLY A TRAP YOU MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO HEAR ABOUT WITH REGARD TO POLITICAL PARTIES BUT A COMPANY
A COMPANY IN THIS CASE IN ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING IMAGES I THINK LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS GEORGE OSBORNE VINCE CABLE ED BALLS ALL FRIENDS TOGETHER MAKING THE CASE REMAIN IN FRONT OF THAT HUGE SIGN WRITTEN RYANAIR AIRCRAFT THE AIRLINE IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT IT IS CAMPAIGNING REPORTED THE INTENSE THIS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EURO IT'S OFFERING DISCOUNTS FOR VOTERS TO COME HOME AND VOTE TO REMAIN NOW VOTE LEVERS REPORTED THEM TO THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT REGISTERED AS CAMPAIGNERS
IN THE REFERENDUM AND THE RULES SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO BE REGISTERED IF YOU INTEND TO SPEND MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND WHAT VOTE LEVER ARGUING HERE THEY'RE SAYING THAT THIS ISN'T JUST PROCESS THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE A WORKABLE RULES IN THIS DEBATE THE RIGHTS THE GOING TO GOVERN SPENDING RYANAIR THEY MAY HAVE A VERY SIMPLE GET OUT WHICH IS THAT THEY ARE BASED IN IRELAND THEY SAID THEY WILL GO ON CAMPAIGNING AND THEY CALLED THE LEAF CAMPAIGN LEAVE LOONIES
BUT THEY VOTE LEAVE HAD ALREADY AS YOU SAY THIS IDEA OF CHEAP FLIGHTS IF YOU COULD DO HELP PEOPLE COME BACK TO VOTE THEY VOTE LEVERED REPORTED TO THEM THEM TO THE POLICE OVER THAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT THEY'D ALREADY GONE TO THE POLICE THAT THE MESS ARE LOOKING AT THAT MAKING AN ASSESSMENT AS THEY ALWAYS SAY THE ALLEGATION THERE WAS IN EFFECT BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION SOMETHING THAT IS ENTIRELY DISMISSED BY THE AIRLINE NOW THEY ARE GEARING UP VOTE LEAF OR A ANOTHER RAIL TOMORROW IN AFFECTS ABOUT THE RULE BOOK ABOUT THE RULES AROUND HEARD OF THE RESTRICTIONS
ON THE CIVIL SERVICE TRYING TO BUILD UP THIS ARGUMENT THAT THEY ARE IN AN UNFAIR FIGHT WHAT MATTERS HERE THOUGH IS THAT EVEN IF FACES BY THIS EVEN IF THEY SAY O.K. I THINK SOMEHOW THIS IS MUCH EASIER FOR DAVID CAMERON SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT THEN YOUR SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT IS THAT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE THEM TO COME OUT ON THE VOTE LEAVE SITE OR CHANGE THEIR MIGHT AND THEY SIMPLY CANNOT KNOW WHAT EFFECT THAT WOULD HAVE RUSSELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN THEY A BAND THAT'S WHAT WE USED TO CALL LEGAL HIGHS THE PRODUCTION SALE DISTRIBUTION AND SUPPLY OF THEM HAS BEEN ILLEGAL SINCE MIDNIGHT CAN A BAN WORK JOIN ON THE LINE BY A CORRESPONDENT ANGUS CRAWFORD EXACTLY HOW WILL THIS BAND WORK ANGUS BECAUSE ONE OF THE POINTS OF LEGAL HIGHS WAS THAT THEY COULD JUST BE RE CONCOCTED A NEW FORMULA DEVELOPED EACH AND EVERY DAY AND THEREFORE THAT MADE THEM VERY VERY HARD IT WAS ALWAYS SAID TO POLICE
THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO ONE KNOWS BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER BEEN IN THIS TERRITORY BEFORE AND JUST REMIND YOU WHAT LEGAL HIGHS SO CALLED LEGAL HIGHS ARE THEY LITERALLY JUST UNREGULATED CHEMICALS PACKAGED UP TO LOOK VERY ATTRACTIVE PARTICULARLY TO YOUNG PEOPLE'S SOLD TOTALLY OPENLY ONLINE AND IN SO CALLED HEAD SHOPS ON THE HIGH STREET IN THE PAST WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS WANTED TO BAN A GRUB OR SET OF DRUGS THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THEM
NAMED THEM AND BANNED THEM BUT IN THIS APPROACH THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT ALL SO CALLED PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES ARE NOW BANNED THAT IT'S UP TO OTHERS TO PROVE EXEMPTION SO WE NOW KNOW THAT ANY SUBSTANCE MADE TO GIVE YOU THE UTERUS PSYCHO ACTIVE EFFECT IS
WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF ALCOHOL CAFFEINE NICOTINE AND SOMETHING CALLED POPPERS SO IN A SENSE THE POLICE CAN TAKE ANYTHING THEY LIKE THEY CAN SAY LOOK IT'S CLEAR WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO DO AND IT IS UP TO THE PERSON DISTRIBUTING OR PRODUCING IT'S A NO NO REALLY IT'S DESIGNED FOR SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT OF COURSE WE HAVEN'T GOT TO THAT POINT WE HAVEN'T YET HAD ONE OF THESE PROSECUTIONS AND WE KNOW THAT THIS ACT WAS DELAYED ONCE BECAUSE OF CONCERNS THAT IT WAS SIMPLY UNENFORCEABLE WE ALSO KNOW THE POLICE BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF MONEY DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST SAID PROVING THAT A PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE WHICH IS JUST GOING TO BE A WHITE SUBSTANCE IN A CLEAR PLASTIC BAG IS PSYCHO ACTIVE IT'S MODELLED ON THE IRISH DO THOUGH IS IT NOT ANGUS
EXACTLY AND AS WE'VE HEARD FROM IRELAND THEY BROUGHT IN A BAND THAT SIX YEARS AGO AND ALTHOUGH THEY DISAPPEARED FROM THE HIGH STREET THE HEAD SHOP'S CLOSED IT WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF THESE SUBSTANCES WE ALSO DO YOU KNOW THAT GETTING PROSECUTIONS HAS BEEN DIFFICULT THERE'S BEEN VERY FEW AND IN
DEATHS HAVE GONE UP SO THE BIG QUESTION ABOUT THIS BILL IS ACT IS WILL IT ACTUALLY STAMP OUT THE TRADE OR WILL IT RISK SIMPLY DRIVING IS ON THE
ANGER'S CRAWFORD THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WILL BE HEARING AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK FROM A WOMAN WHOSE SON DIED IN IRELAND AFTER TAKING ILLEGAL HI IT'S NOW TWENTY MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE TIMES LEADS ON WHAT IT SAYS IS THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF BRITISH SOLDIERS BEING USED IN A COMBAT ROLE AGAINST ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN LIBYA IT REPORTS THAT A SPECIAL FORCES TEAM DESTROYED A LORRY PACKED WITH EXPLOSIVES NEAR MIZ RATA EARLIER THIS MONTH
THE TIME SAYS THE DISCLOSURES CAUSED DISQUIET AMONGST SOME M.P.S WHO FEAR SPECIAL FORCES ARE BEING USED FOR CONVENTIONAL COMBAT OPERATIONS TO GET ROUND THE NEED FOR PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL FOR THEIR DEPLOYMENT BRITAIN WOULD FACE WHAT ARE DESCRIBED AS TORTUOUS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION IF THE COUNTRY VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U. THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE LEAD STORY IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES THE PAPER SAYS BRICKS IT CAMPAIGNERS HAVE ARGUED THE U.K. COULD RELY ON W.T.O. RULES IF IT NO LONGER PART OF THE E.U. SINGLE MARKET
BUT THE HEAD OF THE W.T.O. HAS TOLD THE F.T. THE BRITAIN WOULD NOT SIMPLY BE ABLE TO CUT AND PASTE TERMS THAT LIMP BEING CREATED IN TWO DECADES OF NEGOTIATIONS LED BY BRUSSELS THE DAILY MAIL SAYS AN E.U. REFERENDUM ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN BY OPERATION BLACK VOTE HAS SPARKED FURY BY PORTRAYING A BRECK'S IT SUPPORTER AS AN AGGRESSIVE WHITE SKINHEAD THE AD FEATURES AN ELDERLY ASIAN WOMAN AND A TATTERED THUG FACING EACH OTHER ACROSS A SEESAW WITH THE SLOGAN A VOTE IS A VOTE
OPERATION BLACK VOTE TO EXPLAINS ITS INTENDED TO SHOW MINORITY ETHNIC COMMUNITIES THAT THEIR VOICES MATTER NIGEL FARRAJ TELLS THE MAIL IT'S DEPLORABLE AND DIVISIVE
ON ITS FRONT PAGE THE GUARDING COVERS THE LAUNCH OF WHAT HE CALLS A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO DEFEAT ONLINE MISOGYNY IT SAYS RECLAIM THE INTERNET WILL FEATURE CONSERVATIVE LABOUR AND LIBERAL DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS RESEARCH CARRIED OUT FOR THE CAMPAIGN THE GUARDIAN REPORTS AND SHOW MISOGYNY ON A HUGE SCALE IS CURRENTLY OCCURRING ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE DAILY TELEGRAPH ANNOUNCES THE POTENTIAL END OF THE LINE FOR TICKET CLIPPERS ON TRAINS IT SAYS THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OLD METHOD FOR SHOWING TICKETS HAS BEEN YOU HAVE BEEN USED
COULD BE PHASED OUT BECAUSE INSPECTORS AND EAST ANGLIA HAVE COMPLAINED PROCESSING HUNDREDS OF TICKETS A DAY HE'S HURTING THEIR WRISTS LESS ONEROUS TECHNIQUES WILL NOW BE DEPLOYED FINALLY FROM A TECHNOLOGY OF THE PAST TO ONE OF THE FUTURE THE F.T. LOOKED INTO SO CALLED BIO GAS IT MAY REFER TO IT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY WERE REFERRING TO THE OMISSIONS RELEASED BY HUMAN SEWAGE IT REPORTS THE WATER REGULATOR OFF WHAT HAS TALKED UP THE POSSIBILITY OF THE VAST PLUMES
RELEASED BY WHAT IS KNOWN AS SLUDGE BEING FED INTO THE GAS GRID OR BURNED TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY OR FORT ACKNOWLEDGES ITS INDUSTRY SIR MAYBE A TAD SQUEAMISH ABOUT BUT HIS BOSS TELLS THE F.T. IT BEARS OUT THE OLD ADAGE WHERE THERE'S MUCK THERE'S BRASS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT MINISTERS HAVE BEEN WARNED AGAINST CHANGING THE LAW ON PENSIONS IN A BID TO ATTRACT BUYERS FOR TATA STEEL'S REMAINING U.K. OPERATIONS
TIME NOW IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LIVES OUTING FOR THE DEPUTY'S AT PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS YESTERDAY AS THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE LABOUR'S ANGELA EAGLE WHEN THE HEAD TO HEAD ON PARTY SPLIT A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN YOU KNOW REPORT
WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AWAY IN JAPAN QUESTION TIME WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CHANCELLOR HAND LABOUR'S ANGELA EAGLE TO SHOW WHAT THEY COULD DO JUST IN CASE THE TOP JOBS EVER DO COME FRAE A HELPFUL FIRST QUESTION FROM A CONSERVATIVE MARIA COALFIELD SOFTEN THINGS UP FOR THE CHANCELLOR
DISAGREE BUT THE FIRST PRIORITY OF ANY GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE THE DEFENCE AND SECURITY
CHANCELLOR OUTLINED FOR ME THE STEPS AND THIS GOVERNMENT IS TAKING TO REPLACE A TRIDENT NUCULAR
NO WORRIES GEORGE OSBORNE KNEW THIS ONE WE WILL BRING FORWARD VOTES IN THIS HOUSE AND WE ASK M.P.S FROM ALL SIDES OF THE HOUSE TO SUPPORT THIS VITAL COMMITMENT
WHEN SHE STANDS ON THE HONOURABLE LADY REPRESENTING THE LABOUR PARTY SHOULD INDICATE THAT SUPPORT TODAY TRIDENT TOUCHES A RAW NERVE FOR LABOUR BUT WITH HER TWIN SISTER MARIA SITTING ALONGSIDE ANGELA EAGLE GOT A BIG CHEER FROM HER OWN SIDE WHEN SHE STOOD UP AND SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO TOPPLE INTO THE TRIDENT TRAP BEFORE SHE HAD EVEN STARTED
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE BOW UNTRIED AND YOU SHOULD GET ON WITH
CHANGING THE SUBJECT SHE MOVED ON TO EUROPE SING THE CONSERVATIVES WERE SPLIT AND DESCENDING INTO VICIOUS ACRIMONY SO WAS GEORGE OSBORNE HAVING TO RETHINK HIS FRIENDS LAST WEEK THE EMPLOYMENT MINISTER CALLED THE PARADE
THEY COULD BE A BONFIRE OF WORKERS
DOES THE CHANCELLERY WITH CAR OH DOES HE AGREE WITH LEN MCCLUSKEY
NO MENTION OF THE UNION BOSS LEN MCCLUSKEY BUT GEORGE OSBORNE WANTED AGREEMENT ALL ROUND AS SHE KNOWS WE AGREE ON THIS I THINK IT'S BETTER THAT BRITAIN REMAINS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHY DO IT
SOME CONSENSUS NOW AND SOME OTHER ISSUES LIKE HAVING AN INDEPENDENT NUCLEAR DETERRENT LET'S HAVE A CONSENSUS ON THAT ANGELA EAGLE'S INTERPRETATION OF THAT WAS I THINK HE'S JUST A CRADLE
SHE MIGHT BE FIGHTING ON THE SAME SIDE AS GEORGE OSBORNE ON EUROPE BUT THAT WASN'T GOING TO STOP HER ENJOYING THE POLITICAL TROUBLE IT'S CAUSING TWENTY NINE DAYS TO GO UNTIL THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION THIS COUNTRY HAS FACED IN A GENERATION WE HAVE BEFORE US A GOVERNMENT IN
ADRIFT AT THE MAN
GEORGE OSBORNE SAID IT WAS NO SECRET THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OVER EUROPE THAT WAS WHY THEY WERE HAVING A REFERENDUM OH AND WHAT ABOUT LABOUR THEY ALL SEEM TO WANT OUT OF WESTMINSTER LET'S LOOK AT HER PARLIAMENTARY
DESERTING A SINKING
SHADOW HEALTH MINISTER WANTS TO BE THE MAN FOR LIVERPOOL YOU'VE GOT THE MEMBER FOR BURY SOUTH WANTS TO BE THE MAN FOR MANCHESTER THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY WANTS TO BE THE MAYOR FOR BOTH CITIES
HE SAID WE WERE CREATED JOB OPPORTUNITIES WE DIDN'T MEAN JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE WHOLE SHADOW
BUT IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THE ATTACKS FROM BEHIND STARTED UP THE CONSERVATIVE BERNARD JENKIN IS FURIOUS THAT PRO E.U. MATERIAL WILL STILL BE ON GOVERNMENT WEBSITES DURING THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM SOMETHING HE SAID WOULD BE ILLEGAL
MY RIGHT OF A FRIEND'S ENTHUSIASM TO BLUDGEON THE BRITISH VOTER INTO SUPPORTING THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THEY DON'T REALLY LIKE
HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY PLANNING TO BREAK THE LAW GEORGE OSBORNE SAID HE THOUGHT GOVERNMENT WEBSITES WOULD STAY WITHIN THE LAW BUT VOTERS WERE BEING FACED WITH A HUGE IMPORTANT ISSUE SO
LET'S DEBATE THE SUBSTANCE RATHER THAN THE PROCESS AND THEN THE BRITISH PEOPLE WILL FEEL THAT THEY HAVE HAD A RANGE OF OPINIONS AND THEY CAN MAKE THEIR OWN MIND
AS THE CAMPAIGN WHEREAS ON THE CLAIMS AND COUNTER CLAIMS ARE GETTING EVER MORE INTENSE NEVER MIND THE ECONOMY THE CONSERVATIVE RICHARD DRAX HAD A NEW ONE IS SPECIALLY DESIGNED TO WORRY M. PIECE
WHAT A PRIVILEGE IT IS TO BE CALLED BY YOU BECAUSE OF THE REMAINING TEAM HAVE THEIR DAY ON THE TWENTY FOURTH OF JUNE I SHALL HAVE TO PI BY EMAIL TO HER YOUNG CALF TO ASK A QUESTION
SURPRISING NEWS IF TRUE BUT IT WOULD MAKE PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS A LOT QUIETER
SUSAN HUME REPORTING AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE AS USUAL AT HALF EIGHT ON LONG WAVE AND DIGITAL RADIO IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE KILLING OF THE LEADER OF THE TALIBAN WILL A MAN SAW IN A DRONE STRIKE AT THE WEEKEND WOULD REDUCE THE SUPPLY OF OPIUM FROM AFGHANISTAN HE OFF HE AFTER ALL WAS CONSIDERED PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR AN INCREASE IN OPIUM WHEN THE TALIBAN WERE IN GOVERNMENT BUT OPIUM IS INCREASINGLY BEING GROWN ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING IN GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED AREAS AS A CORRESPONDENT JUSTIN ROLLER HAS BEEN DISCOVERING
WE'VE JUST TURNED OFF THE MAIN ROAD AND DRIVING IN A FARMING COMMUNITY THERE ARE BIG
MUD WALLS EITHER SIDE OF US AND THEN THEY OPEN OUT TO FIELDS THIS WAS NEVER TRADITIONALLY A POPPY GROWING AREA BUT NOW
LARGE QUANTITIES OF POPPY ARE GROWN HERE
WE PULL OVER BESIDE A HUGE POPPY FEEL
WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY IS THAT THIS IS JUST OVER HALF AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE CITY OF MAZAR E. SHARIF THIS REGION IS BY AFGHAN STANDARDS RECKONED TO BE A MODEL OF GOOD GOVERNANCE WHO COME INTO THE FIELD IT'S
IT'S JUST AFTER DAWN AND THIS IS THE IDEAL TIME FOR COLLECTING OPIUM THEY SCORED THE POPPY HEADS LAST NIGHT
A LINE OF FOUR OR FIVE LITTLE SCRATCHES AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THE OPIUM WELLS UP AND SEATS OUT AND FORMS IT'S A WHITE PASTE WITH A BLACK CRUST OVER AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW AND THEN IF YOU CAN HEAR
IT'S GREAT BEING THIS PASTE AWAY WITH A LITTLE SICKLE SHAPE NIGHT THEY'VE GOT AND COLLECTING IT UP
IT'S QUITE WATERY ISN'T IT DO YOU DRY THE OPIUM WAR WHICH ARE USING ANOTHER WAY THOUGH
HOW MUCH OPIUM WILL YOU COLLECT TODAY IN THIS LITTLE SCHEME ONE AND HALF A KILO SO ONE AND A HALF KILOS AND HOW MUCH WOULD ONE AND A HALF YEARS BE WORTH HERE WASN'T IT
ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND AFGHANIS WHICH IS WHAT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ABOUT SEVENTY WHICH I HAVE TO SAY I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT OPIUM PRICING THAT THAT'S QUITE I'VE GOT THAT'S WORTH A LOT MORE WHEN IT TURNS UP ON THE STREETS OF BRITAIN AS HEROIN WHICH IS OF COURSE
ALMOST CERTAINLY WHERE IT'S HEADED I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN AS WE TALK A MAN APPROACHES WITH AN A.K. FORTY SEVEN I'M ANXIOUS BUT THE FARMER TELLS ME NOT TO WORRY THE AS THE LOCAL PLACEMENT
OVER A COUPLE OF SAFFRON TEETH THANK YOU THE FARMER TELLS ME HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO GROW OPIUM HE GETS THREE TIMES AS MUCH FOR IT AS OTHER CROPS
IT IS OBVIOUS THE AUTHORITIES KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING I SAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE GUY SITTING NEXT TO YOU IS LOCAL POLICEMAN THAT ACCURATELY THE BULLIES HELPERS PRODUCER ALTAR FROM HERE THEIR LOCAL BEATEN THE UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURES ON US THE UNDERSTAND WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GROW PALE THEY TREAT US WE'LL ALL GET ALONG FINE SUDS HE SAYS HE LIKED OURS PAY A SMALL AMOUNT BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN PER CENT OF HIS PROFITS
TO LOCAL OFFICIALS IF WONDERFUL SHIRLEY LOOK WHAT ABOUT HELEN I'M GOING TO WAS CELICA BEHELD THE GOVERNMENT OR THE GOVERNMENT HELPS THIS THERE'S BUSINESS ONLY WORKS BECAUSE EVERYONE HELPS EACH OTHER ON OF COURSE I DON'T YOU IT IS A PATTERN REPEATED ACROSS THE COUNTRY SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW POPPY CULTIVATION EXPANDING IN MANY GOVERNMENT CONTROL AREAS OFTEN WITHIN SIGHT OF OFFICIAL BUILDINGS SO RELATE
AND THIS IS WHERE SULIMAN AS HIM HIS OFFICE YEAH BUT THE MINISTER OF COUNTER NARCOTICS O.K. BRILLIANT YET WHEN WE VISITED THE COUNTER NARCOTICS MINISTRY IN KABUL THE OFFICIAL LINE IS THAT AFGHANISTAN IS WINNING THE WAR ON DRUGS
THEY'RE ONLY UNSTUCK IF FARMERS GREW OPIUM IN AREAS THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS THEN YOU CAN BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAIN THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL DESTROY IT WITH THE HELP OF LOCAL PEOPLE AND THE POLICE BUT THE OFFICE OF MINISTER SALMA AS AMY IS LINED WITH MAPS SHOWING HOW MUCH OPIUM IS BEING GROWN AND WEAR AND MOST OF THE AREAS MARKED
IN THEORY AT LEAST UNDER OFFICIAL CONTROL BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE MAPS AROUND YOUR OFFICE TO SEE THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF POPPY BEING GROWN IN GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED AREAS ON THE AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT FARMERS ARE NOT GROWING OPIUM GRILLING BUT BECAUSE OF THE POVERTY AND HERE THEY ARE SO THERE MAY BE SOME PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE GROWING OR PIANO
THE TRUTH IS THAT WITH OR WITHOUT MULLAH MAN SAW AT THE HEAD OF THE TALIBAN AFGHANISTAN IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE MORE OPIUM
AND THEREFORE HEROIN THAN THE WORLD CURRENTLY CONSUMES IT ISN'T HARD TO WORK OUT WHAT THAT MEANS
MORE AND CHEAPER HEROIN COMING TO A STREET NEAR YOU
JUSTIN ROLLER REPORTING THERE IT'S SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE H. S. TWO COSTS FIVE TIMES AS MUCH PER MILE TO BUILD AS THE LATEST HIGH SPEED T.G.V. RAIL LINE BEING BUILT IN FRANCE AND ACCORDING TO A GROUP OF TRANSPORT ACADEMICS THEY ALSO QUESTION WHY IT'S BEEN DESIGNED TO RUN AT SUPERFAST SPEEDS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES PER HOUR WHICH IS MUCH LESS GREEN THAN THE MORE TYPICAL FAST TRAIN SPEED OF ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY
ONE OF THOSE BEHIND THE REPORT IS TONY MAY WHO'S EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF TRANSPORT ENGINEERING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS GOOD MORNING TO YOU PROFESSOR GOOD MORNING NOW DID IF YOU HAD ROGER HAD BEEN A SHORT DAY A FEW MOMENTS AGO SAYING THAT WHEN HE FIRST SAW YOUR FIGURES ON THIS HE STRUGGLED TO BELIEVE THE COSTINGS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO HIGH HOW DID YOU REACH THEM WELL IT THEY ARE EXTRAORDINARY AREN'T PLAY THE FIFTY SIX BILLION POUNDS BILLION POUNDS THAT H. S. TWO IS EXPECTED TO COST IS A GOVERNMENT FIGURE
THE COSTS OF THE BEELINE COME FROM MY WELL REGARDED RAIL TECHNOLOGY WEBSITE WHICH PROVIDES ESTIMATES FOR ALL SUCH PROJECTS IN A WAY IT'S NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING AT EUSTON ARE LOW
THAT IS GETTING ON FOR THE COST OF THE WHOLE OF THAT T. V. V. LINE SO IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE VERY OPEN DESIGN PROJECT AND WHAT CONCERNS US MOST
IS THAT IT HAS FOUR OBJECTIVES BUT AS WE SEE IT IT WILL ONLY EVER REACH ONE OF THEM O.K. BUT JUST BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THOSE OBJECTIVES ON THE QUESTIONS HAVE CROSSED IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR EXACTLY EXACTLY THAT TAKE THE LOCATION YOU POINT OUT EUSTON CENTRAL LONDON EXPENSIVE OH OF COURSE
YES AND WE'RE NOT COMPARING LIKE WITH LIKE BUT A FIVEFOLD INCREASE ISN'T WERE YOU THINK JUSTIFIABLE IF YOU TURN IT THE OTHER WAY ROUND AND SAY WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR OUR FIFTY SIX BILLION
WHAT THE SCHEME WAS DESIGNED TO DO WAS ADD CAPACITY OUT OF LONDON IMPROVE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CITIES REGENERATE THE NORTH MUCH MADE OF THAT AND CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS
AND THE ONLY ONE OF THOSE THAT IT CLEARLY AND
ACCEPTABLY ACHIEVES HIS INCREASING CAPACITY
THE OTHERS ARE VERY DOUBTFUL INDEED O.K. BUT IT WAS LET'S TAKE TWO OF THOSE OTHERS IMPROVING CONNECTIONS DOESN'T IT OBVIOUSLY DO THAT WELL OF COURSE IT DOES BETWEEN LONDON AND THE CENTRE OF LEEDS AND THE CENTRE OF MANCHESTER BUT WHAT'S HIDDEN IN THE INFORMATION IS IT'S PLANNED ALONGSIDE CUTS TO EXISTING SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE OF STOCKPORT AND WAKEFIELD WILL HAVE THEIR SERVICE FREQUENCY TO LONDON
SO THEIR ALTERNATIVE IS TRAVEL INTO MANCHESTER INTO LEEDS IN ORDER TO BENEFIT I'M GOING TO BE RIGHT BUT YOU JUST LOOK AT THE POPULATION OF LEEDS MANCHESTER VERSUS STOCKPORT WAKEFIELD AND THERE'S A LOGIC TO THAT WELL THERE IS BUT THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE JOSEPH ROWNTREE FOUNDATION FIGURES ON WELL THAT TWELVE MOST IMPOVERISHED CITIES
TEN OF THEM ARE IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND SO THERE'S A CLEAR CASE FOR INVESTING IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND BUT NONE OF THEM IS IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO EITHER OF THOSE STATIONS WHO TAKE SOMEONE LIKE BRADFORD OR ROCHDALE THEY ARE LIKELY TO SUFFER
AS LEEDS AND MANCHESTER GROW BUT ISN'T THERE AN ARGUMENT THAT AND THIS BRINGS US TO ONE OF THOSE THIRD OBJECTIVES WHICH IS REGENERATES IN THE NORTHERN WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE THAT IF YOU DO BUILD UP LEEDS AND MANCHESTER YES THERE MAY BE ELEMENTS AROUND IT THAT A HIT BUT OVERALL THE WHOLE AREA WILL BENEFIT
TO SOME EXTENT BUT THE EVIDENCE IS VERY VERY
WE'VE LOOKED AT THREE ECONOMISTS ESTIMATES OF THE REGENERATION BENEFITS AND THEY RANGE FROM TEN MILLION A YEAR TO FIFTEEN BILLION A YEAR SO THE ECONOMISTS DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS ANYWAY LOOK AT THE FORTY BUT WE'RE WE'RE UP AGAINST TIME WHAT'S IN A WORD WOULD YOU CANCEL IT
WHAT I WOULD DO WOULD BE TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES I THINK TEN TEN BILLION FOR CAPACITY IN LONDON AND TWENTY BILLION PREPARE FOR IMPROVEMENTS ON THE NORTH AND YOU'D HAVE A SIGNIFICANT SUM LEFT FOR OTHER BETTER CAUSES TONY MAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH PHIL AVERY'S HERE WITH THE WEATHER AT THREE MINUTES
MAKES IT VERY GOOD MORNING TO SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND STARTING OFF WITH A WEE BIT OF FOG BUT THERE IS SOME SUNSHINE TO BE HAD TEMPERATURES RESPONDING TO THAT YOU GET ON INTO THE TEENS QUITE NICELY SOMEWHERE MAYBE AROUND ABOUT THE LONDON AIR TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE COME THIS AFTERNOON FURTHER NORTH THROUGH WALES THE MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA A LOT OF CLOUD THIS MORNING DRY FOR THE MOST PART IT WILL IMPROVE WITH TIME AND THERE WOULD BE A BIT THE SUNSHINE YOU GET TO MAYBE THE ODD LIGHT SHOWER THIS AFTERNOON
AND WE'LL LOOK AT THE MID TEENS FOR HER TEMPERATURE THEN NORTHERN IRELAND NORTHERN ENGLAND SOUTHERN SCOTLAND OR YOU'RE STUCK UNDER AN AWFUL LOT OF LOW CLOUD HERE THAT'S THE WAY I'M AFRAID IT'S GOING TO STAY FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY THERE'S SOME RAIN AND DRIZZLE WITH THAT SOME HILL FOG AS WELL IT'S MISERABLE FAIR TEMPERATURES STUCK IN THE LOW TEENS IF YOU'RE LUCKY AND THE HEAVIEST OF THE RAIN SOUTHEY SCOTLAND'S AND THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND SO WHAT GOOD NEWS
ANYWHERE NORTH OF THE CENTRAL BELT IN SCOTLAND IN FOR A DRY DAY WITH SOME SUNSHINE THERE WILL BE SOME CLOUD AROUND ABOUT THE MORAY FIRTH AGAIN AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN RECENT DAYS AND THE BEST OF IT HERE THE TEMPERATURES SEVENTEEN IF YOU STUCK WITH SOME LOW CLOUD YOU MAY BE CLOSER TO ELEVEN OR TWELVE
THANKS VERY MUCH PHIL IT'S A BIT OF A TREAT THERE SATURDAY MORNING ON RADIO FOUR YOU JUST SWALLOWED
MY HAND CREAMS AND I WANTED TO KIND OF GO BACK TO SQUARE
JUST DO IT AS WE DON'T IT THE BEATLES PAUL MCCARTNEY IN CONVERSATION I COULDA JUST GONE INTO A SUPER GROUP BUT WINGS WE ENDED UP PLAYING UNIVERSITIES AND PUNCTUATED TO TOWN HALL

HE TALKS TO JOHN WILSON IN MASTER TAPES THIS SATURDAY MORNING TEN ON B.B.C. RADIO
IN THE NEXT HOUR ON THIS PROGRAMME WILL BE DISCUSSING THE MIGRATION CRISIS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WITH ITALY EUROPE MINISTER AFTER DRAMATIC PICTURES EMERGED OF A SHIP SINKING YESTERDAY WITH MANY MANY REFUGEES ON BOARD AND WE'LL HEAR FROM A MOTHER WHO LOST HER SON TO LEGAL HIGHS AND WHAT SHE THINKS OF TODAY'S NEW BAND YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY WITH NICK ROBINSON AND SARAH MONTAGUE
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE TWENTY SIXTH MAY THE HEADLINES THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT A PLAN TO CHANGE THE LAW ON PENSIONS TO HELP FIND A BUYER FOR TATA STEEL'S MAKING TATTERS STILL MAKING OPERATIONS IN THE U.K. THE TWO SIDES IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WILL FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION AS THE LATEST MIGRATION FIGURES ARE PUBLISHED AND ARE SPENDING WATCHDOG SAYS DELAYS AND DISCHARGING HOSPITAL PATIENTS ARE COSTING THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THE GOVERNMENT'S BEING URGED TO MAKE A COMMON STATEMENT ON ITS PLANS TO CHANGE THE LAW ON PENSIONS IN A BID TO FIND A BUYER FOR THE REMAINING U.K. OPERATIONS OF TATA STEEL MINISTERS WANT TO REDUCE THE LIABILITIES OF THE OLD BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME RUN BY TATA BY BASING FUTURE ANNUAL INCREASES IN PAYMENTS ON A DIFFERENT MEASURE FROM THE ONE CURRENTLY USED
THE FORMER PENSIONS MINISTER STEVE WEBB SAID RUSH LEGISLATION WRIST DRIVING A COACH AND HORSES THROUGH THE SECURITY OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS BEYOND THE STEEL INDUSTRY IT'S A BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON
UNIONS ARE LIKELY TO SUPPORT GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS TO REDUCE THE BENEFITS OF ONE OF THE U.K.'S BIGGEST PENSION SCHEMES IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT IN THE COMMONS MINISTERS WILL OUTLINE PROPOSALS THEY COULD REDUCE BENEFITS BY CHANGING THE ANNUAL INCREASE FROM THE CURRENT RETAIL PRICE MEASURE OF INFLATION TO THE USUALLY LOWER CONSUMER PRICE MEASURE
FIFTEEN BILLION POUND FUND AND IT'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUND DEFICIT HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF UNEASE FOR CURRENT OWNERS TARTAR AND A DEAL BREAKER FOR ANY WOULD BE BUYERS PRODUCING ITS BURDEN WOULD MAKE HER SELL EASIER AND MAY EVEN CONVINCED TARTARE TO HANG ON TO ITS U.K. STILL BUSINESS FORM PENSIONS MINISTER STEVE WEBB HAS DESCRIBED THE IDEA AS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
BUT UNION LEADERS ARE LIKELY TO ACCEPT THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS A BETTER DEAL THAN SEEING THE PENSION SCHEME PLACED INTO THEIR PENSIONS LIFEBOAT FUND WHICH CAN SEE SOME MEMBERS LEAST TEN PER CENT OF THEIR PAY OUT IMMEDIATELY AND SEE LOWER INCREMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS
THE SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION IS LIKELY TO DOMINATE CAMPAIGNING IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE TODAY AS THE LATEST OFFICIAL FIGURES ARE NET MIGRATION HAVE PUBLISHED THE FORMER HOME SECRETARY LORD BLUNKETT'S WHO BACKS THE REMAIN SIDE WILL SAY IT WOULD BE A CALAMITY AT AN AGREEMENT ALLOWING U.K. BORDER CONTROLS ON FRENCH SOIL WAS SCRAPPED
BUT THE FORMER SHADOW HOME SECRETARY DAVID DAVIS OR LEAVE CAMPAIGNER WILL CLAIM THAT E.U. MEMBERSHIP HAS SEEN BRITISH JOBS TRANSFERRED TO WORKERS FROM THE CONTINENT HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON
SENIOR FIGURES IN THE REMAIN CAMP BELIEVE THEY ARE WINNING THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT FOR CONTINUED E.U. MEMBERSHIP BUT TODAY A FORMER CONSERVATIVE EUROPE MINISTER REFUSED TO GIVE GROUND DAVID DAVIES WILL ACCUSE THOSE WHO WANT TO STAY IN THE E.U. OF BAKING A RELENTLESS PESSIMISTIC CASE WILL CLAIM AT THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A JOB'S TRANSFER MACHINE WHICH SWITCHES EMPLOYMENT IN THE U.K. FROM BRITISH WORKERS TO THOSE FROM THE CONTINENT
THE FORMER LABOUR HOME SECRETARY DAVID BLUNKETT FOOTED NO TO JOIN IN WHAT WAS THE E.C. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES BUT IN A SPEECH TODAY THE WORLD HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN UNTIL ATTEMPT TO FATE AS OPPONENTS ON THEIR CHOSEN TERRITORY OF IMMIGRATION
YOU SUGGEST YOU MEMBERSHIP HELPED HIM NEGOTIATE THE CLOSURE OF THE SONG GUTS CAN'T CARRY MORE THAN A DECADE AGO AND ESTABLISH BRITISH BORDER CONTROLS ON FRENCH SOIL
THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK HAS APPEALED FOR GLOBAL SUPPORT HELP DEAL WITH THE MIGRANT CRISIS IN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST HE WAS SPEAKING IN JAPAN AT THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT OF INDUSTRIALISED NATIONS A DAY AFTER DRAMATIC PHOTOGRAPHS EMERGED OF AN OVERCROWDED BOAT CAPSIZING OFF THE COAST OF LIBYA KILLING FIVE PEOPLE FROM THE SUMMIT IN A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE REPORTS
PRESENT TO US SAID GEOGRAPHY MEANT THAT EUROPE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE MOST RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEALING WITH THE MIGRATION CRISIS AND HE SAID THE NUMBERS COMING ACROSS FROM LIBYA TO ITALY IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WERE NOT ENCOURAGING
BUT HE SAID THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD TO RECOGNISE THAT THIS WAS ALSO A GLOBAL CRISIS SO HE URGED WORLD LEADERS AT THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT HERE IN JAPAN TO PROVIDE MORE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PARTICULARLY TO COUNTRIES HOSTING MOST REFUGEES HE SAID THAT TURKEY JORDAN AND LEBANON WHERE MILLIONS HAVE FLED FROM SYRIA WERE PROVIDING A GLOBAL PUBLIC GOOD AND THEY SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL COMMUNITY MY SAID HE DID NOT EXPECT ANY SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENTS LET'S JUST START HE SAID WITH SOME GOODWILL
THE SPENDING WATCHDOG IN ENGLAND SAYS DELAYS AND DISCHARGING PATIENTS FROM HOSPITAL COSTING THE N.H.S. MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE IS CALLING FOR URGENT ACTION TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM
KEEPING ORDER PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL LONGER THAN NECESSARY CAN DAMAGE THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY AND IS EXPENSIVE BUT IT'S A GROWING PROBLEM LAST YEAR BED DAYS LOST IN THIS WAY AND ENGLAND REACHED ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION THAT'S MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT IN TWO YEARS AND THE N.A.O. RECKONS THE TRUE FIGURES MUCH HIGHER
HE PUTS THE OVERALL COST OF THE PROBLEM AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION POUNDS AND WHILE IT ACKNOWLEDGES THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EFFORTS TO TACKLE DELAY DISCHARGES IT SAYS THERE NEEDS TO BE A STEP CHANGE IN PERFORMANCE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN ENGLAND SAYS IT'S INCREASED FUNDING AND IS WORKING WITH THE N.H.S. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE TRANSFERS OUT OF HOSPITAL
A GROUP OF INDEPENDENT TRANSPORT EXPERTS HAS DESCRIBED THE PROPOSED NEW HIGH SPEED RAIL LINK H. S. TWO AS AN OVERPRICED PROJECT THAT WILL FAIL IN MANY OF ITS OBJECTIVES ACADEMICS SAY THEY SUPPORT THE PROJECT IN PRINCIPLE BUT CLAIM IT COULD BE COMPLETED MUCH MORE CHEAPLY AND WITH LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS HERE'S OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER HERBIE
THESE ACADEMIC SUPPORT HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT THE DUBIOUS ABOUT THE ROUTE OF H. S. TWO AND THEY THINK IT'LL BENEFIT LONDON MORE THAN IT HELPS THE NORTH THEY ALSO OPPOSED THE DECISION TO DESIGN THE H. S. TWO TRACTOR TAKES SUPER FAST TRAINS RUNNING AT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES AN HOUR MUCH FASTER THAN ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILES AN HOUR NORMAL FOR CONTINENTAL HIGH SPEED TRAINS WHICH COVER MUCH GREATER DISTANCES
THE ACADEMICS SAY THE U.K. IS FAR TOO SMALL TO JUSTIFY THE EXTRA COST OF DISRUPTION THEY CALCULATE THAT SUPER FAST RUNNING WILL ALSO INCREASE CARBON EMISSIONS BY A QUARTER
H. S. TWO SAY THE CARBON INCREASE WILL BE LESS THAN THAT BUT THEY DIDN'T COMMENT ON ANOTHER ALLEGATION THAT THE COST OF BUILDING H. S. TWO PER MILE WILL BE FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN BUILDING A SIMILAR HIGH SPEED TRACK IN FRANCE
A REPORT BY U.S. SPENDING WATCHDOG HAS FOUND SOME OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT'S COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE SO OLD THAT THEY STILL USE FLOPPY DISKS THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE SAYS THE BUDGET TO MAINTAIN AGEING TECHNOLOGY HAS THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT ON MODERN I.T. INFRASTRUCTURE
A BAN ON PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES KNOWN AS LEGAL HIGHS HAS COME INTO FORCE ACROSS THE U.K. THIS HAVE BEEN EXPRESS THAT DEALERS WILL NOW USE WHAT'S CALLED THE DARK WEB KEITH DOYLE REPORTS
SO CALLED LEGAL HIGHS WERE LINKED TO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED DEATHS IN THE U.K. LAST YEAR THE CHEMICALS ARE DESIGNED TO GIVE USERS THE SAME EFFECT AS DRUGS SUCH AS CANNABIS AND COCAINE THEY HAD BEEN SOLD LEGALLY UNDER A MULTITUDE OF NAMES INCLUDING BLACK MAMBA AND SPICE THE PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION SALE AND SUPPLY OF THE CHEMICALS IS NOW ILLEGAL WITH OFFENDERS FACING UP TO SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON
POLICE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO SHUT DOWN SO CALLED HEAD SHOPS WHICH SELL THEM AND ONLINE BUSINESSES THAT SUPPLY DRUG PARAPHERNALIA THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS COUNCILS IN ENGLAND WARNED OF THE TRADE COULD MOVE ON TO HIDDEN WEBSITES AND CALLED FOR MORE RESOURCES TO TACKLE THE ONLINE THREAT
THE B.B.C. HAS LEARNED THAT THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND IS SPENDING THREE TIMES MORE ON PRIVATE AMBULANCES FOR NINE NINE NINE CALLS THAN IT DID FOUR YEARS AGO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAYS PRIVATE AMBULANCES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RIGOUROUS INSPECTIONS AS N.H.S. VEHICLES
THE ROYAL NAVY IS LOOKING INTO CLAIMS THAT THE WRECK OF A BRITISH SUBMARINE LOST DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR HAS BEEN FOUND OFF SARDINIA AND ITALIAN DIVER MASSIMO BOND SAYS HE DISCOVERED THE VESSEL KNOWN AS P. THREE ONE ONE AT A DEPTH OF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FEET HUGH MORGAN HAS THE DETAILS
THE P. THREE ONE ONE WAS LAST SEEN IN DECEMBER NINETEEN FORTY TWO WHEN SHE LEFT MALTA TO TAKE PART IN OPERATION PRINCIPLE AN ALLIED ATTACK ON ITALIAN WARSHIPS OF SARDINIA SOME REPORTS SUGGEST SHE MAY HAVE BEEN SUNK BY ITALIAN MIND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE BODIES OF THE SUBMARINE'S CAPTAIN COMMANDER RICHARD KAYLEIGH AND THE CREW OF SEVENTY ONE WERE NEVER FOUND COMMANDER K'EHLEYR ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY DECORATED SUBMARINE COMMANDERS OF THE WAR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DESTROYING MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND TONNES OF ENEMY SHIPPING
HIS SUCCESS IN THE NICKNAME DEAD EYE DICK MY BOND ONLY SAYS HE WAS ABLE TO POSITIVELY IDENTIFY THE SUBMARINE AS THE P. THREE ONE ONE BY THE TWO CHARIOT MAN TORPEDOES STRAPPED TO THE HULL A ROYAL NAVY SPOKESMAN SAID IT WAS EXAMINING ITS RECORDS TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE WRECKAGE FOUND COULD BE THAT OF A ROYAL NAVY SUBMARINE
HUGH MORGAN REPORTING IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IMAGES COULD SCARCELY BE MORE DRAMATIC THE FIRST SHOWS A FISHING VESSEL CRAMMED WITH PEOPLE OFF THE COAST OF LIBYA IN THERE NEXT IT'S BEGINNING TO TURN OVER AFTER THE MIGRANTS ON BOARD HAVE RUSHED TO ONE SIDE HAVING SPOTTED A RESCUE SHIP
FINALLY IT TURNS OVER CASTING MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE INTO THE C. SAMA SEEN HANGING ONTO THE EDGE BY THEIR FINGERTIPS OTHERS I'D SEEN TRYING TO BALANCE ON THE RIM MIRACULOUSLY IT SEEMS THE CHEST FUN EITHER OF THEM HAVE DIED OF THE ITALIAN NAVY CAME TO THEIR RESCUE COMMANDER FRANCESCA VASO THE COMMANDER OF THE BETTER CA PATROL BOAT THAT RESCUED THE MIGRANTS HAS BEEN TELLING US WHAT HAPPENED
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WAS OVERCROWDED AND THEY BUILT THE THIRD PARTY THAT ALTHOUGH I TRY TO KEEP THE PEOPLE SHOUTING TO THEIR MAIN THEY BLEED
THE IMAGES ARE UNUSUAL WHAT HAPPENED IS NOT THIS WEEK ALONE SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAVED IN THE WATERS BETWEEN LIBYA AND ITALY THESE I'M NOT REMEMBER PEOPLE FLEEING THE WAR IN SYRIA IN THE MAIN BUT ESCAPING CONFLICT AND POVERTY IN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA NIGERIA SOMALIA GAMBIA AND ERITREA I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO SANDRO COSY ITALY'S EUROPE MINISTER ABOUT THE RESCUE
IN THE THREAD IN THE EXCITING NEWS THE THAT WE WE NEVER MENACE TO SAVE SO MANY LIVES FOR OVER FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND WE THINK THAT THAT IS FALSE TO SAY HE LIVES IN THEM
AND WE WANT YOU TO STRENGTHEN OUR OPERATION AND WE THINK THAT THE FALSE THAT UNITY THAT THESE PICTURES ARE RARE THEY ARE DRAMATIC BUT THIS SORT OF POTENTIAL TRAGEDY IS HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE WEEK
YES EVERYTHING ALL WEEK BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR NOW THAT ONCE HE'S ON THAT ENDED WITH THE CLOTHES YOU'RE THE FAT OR THE SO CALLED BIKE I WROTE TO THE MATRON JAN IT POSSIBLE ABOUT AGAIN AND THAT IS WHY I HAD TO CHANGE HER BODY SINK AT THE NECESSARY MEASURE NOT THERE'LL BE NORTH AFRICA WE'VE HEARD A VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING THIS YEAR BUT IT IS STILL ROUGHLY IN LINE IS IT NOT WITH A VERY HIGH NUMBERS WE SAW LAST YEAR
YEAH YEAH THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND THAT IS WHY THOSE WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT THE INVASION THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF THE SAME
END BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT WE CAN WE NOT DO NOT THEY'VE TOOK OF ME THE SAME STAKES THAT GUN NAME AND THESE VERY KEENLY IN NOT UPPY ER IN THE END WITH YEAH MEN THE FLOOR AT EVERY PARTY
IS THAT POSSIBLE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERE IS A LIBYAN GOVERNMENT NOW IT IS STILL A WEAK AND UNSTABLE GOVERNMENT ARE THEY CAPABLE OF DOING WHAT YOU THINK IS NECESSARY IT IS AS DIFFICULT AS COMPLEX AS NECESSARY WE ARE AT THE BEGINNING ON THIS NEW GOVERNMENT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THEN THEY'RE TRAINING FOR THE REPEAL YOU NOT TO BE TRAIN NOT THE LETTERING
THAT IF YOUNG CAUSED TO SOURCE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT UNDER THEIR EUROPEAN OPERATION YOU ENOUGH FOR MADE THE OPERATION CAN NOW WE'LL SOON BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN THE VERY THOUGHT OF AND THESE ARE ALL A POSITIVE STEP IT TOWARD THE RIGHT DIRECTION YOU GET YOU NEED THE SUPPORT OFF OF THE PARTNERS AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE WERE EITHER
RIGHTLY TODAY AT THE G.SEVEN TOWARDS PRESIDENTS PRESIDENT TO SCHOOL YOU'LL GO A RISK OF THE SUPPORT THAT YOU SEVEN OF THE REPAIR YOU KNOW IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS CRIES YOU SEEN THE MATRON YEAH NOT IN AFRICA WE HAVE SEEN HOW THE E. USE DEAL WITH TURKEY EFFECTIVELY STOPPED THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS ACROSS THE SEAS TO GREECE IS SOMETHING SIMILAR POSSIBLE OR DO YOU THINK IT IS NEVER POSSIBLE TO STOP THE FLOW ON THAT SCALE FROM LIBYA
IT IS BOTH SYMBOLIC THESE STICKY OUT THAT THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CONTEXT TO BATH MUST SHOW THEIR FEAR OF MINISTERS OF THE SAME DETERMINATION AND THE SAME YOU NEED THE BEST SURE WITH CHUCKIE YOU TALK OF UNITY YOU IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES INCLUDING BRITAIN WHO HAVE EFFECTIVELY LEFT IT TO ITALY AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHO ARE DEALING WITH THIS INFLOW TO DEAL WITH IT PRETTY MUCH ON THEIR OWN DO YOU STILL BELIEVE NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE
I THINK THAT THAT THINGS HAVE IMPROVED THE SOUTH DELHI IT DAHLIA STANDARD JOB FOR THE VIOLA UNION THEY THEY'RE ALL ON ITS OWN THERE FOR A LONG TIME TO FIND THAT THERE ARE OTHER PARTNERS ROCKALL MEET YOU COMMIT THAT IF THEY WERE SERIOUS DISCUSSING PROPOSED THAT WHICH WE'RE ITALIAN PROPOSAL IF THE BEGINNING AND WHICH OTHER RIGHT
SUCH AS A EUROPEAN BORDER POOR EASTERN EUROPE YOUNG COURSE AND NOTABLY A NEW RELATIONS THE NEW PET ON DEVELOPING AND IMMIGRATION BETWEEN EUROPE AND AFRICA WE DON'T LEAVE THAT THOSE ARE THE TOUR RIGHT AND TO SPEED UP WE HAVE TO GO VERY FAST MY COSY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BE HERE IN THE WHOLE OF THAT STORY FROM THE ITALIAN NAVY COMMANDER JUST AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN M.P.S HAVE WARNED THAT AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN EVERY YEAR COULD BE AT TERRIBLE RISK BECAUSE THE POLICE DON'T RESPOND WHEN THEY GO MISSING THE PARLIAMENTARY GROUP FOR RUNAWAY ARE MISSING CHILDREN AND ADULTS IS CALLING FOR THE SYSTEM OF CATEGORISING CHILDREN AS EITHER MISSING OR ABSENT TO BE SCRAPPED
THAT'S BECAUSE THE POLICE ONLY RESPOND WHEN A CHILD IS DESCRIBED AS MISSING AND YET THE M.P.S SAY THAT MANY ABSENT CHILDREN ARE IN DANGER OF BEING GROOMED AND SEXUALLY EXPLOITED OR INVOLVED IN CRIMINALITY WHETHER LABOUR M.P. AND KOFI WHO CHAIRED THAT ENQUIRY IS WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THE DEFINITIONS OF THESE TWO CATEGORIES MISSING OR ABSENT DIFFER ACCORDING TO WHETHER A CHILD IS JUDGED AT RISK AND SURELY THAT IS RIGHT THAT THE POLICE SHOULD PRIORITISE THOSE WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO COME TO HARM
OF COURSE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THAT INITIAL CATEGORISATION IS DONE BY A POLICE CALL HANDLER WHO ASKS MAYBE SOME VERY BASIC QUESTIONS AND AT THAT POINT THE CHILDLESS THEY PUT INTO EITHER A MISSING OR AN ABSENT CATEGORY AND OF COURSE WITH ABSOLUTE CATEGORY THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE POLICE RESPONSE WITH THE MISSING THERE IS SO IT'S VERY RELIANT ON A VERY CRUDE ASSESSMENT TOOL INITIALLY
THE ARGUMENT THEN SURELY IS TO GET THOSE QUESTIONS RIGHT BUT TO KEEP THE SYSTEM BUT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IT SHOULD BE AN ABANDONED ENTIRELY WELL I THINK IF WE ARE REALLY TO ASSESS RISK AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT IT'S ABOUT SAFEGUARDING CHILDREN WE NEED TO HAVE THE MAXIMUM INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT CHILD'S LIFE AND IT'S NOT ONLY THE POLICE WHO HAVE THAT INFORMATION CHILDREN SERVICES HAVE INFORMATION SCHOOLS OF INFORMATION
PARENTS OF INFORMATION AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT USES THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO MAKE ACH AN ACCURATE RISK ASSESSMENTS OF THOSE CHILDREN WHO ARE AT RISK GET THE RESPONSE THAT IS NEEDED TO PROTECT THEM
DID YOU ESTABLISH THAT ANY INDIVIDUAL ANY CHILD WERE SPECIFICALLY IN DANGER AS A RESULT OF BEING WRONGLY CUT WELL WE HAD EVIDENCE GIVEN TO US ACQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE OF A CASE OF A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO IN FACT THEY'D BEEN THIS DESIGNATED ABSENT FOR FOUR WEEKS
AND WHEN EVENTUALLY SHE WAS RECLASSIFIED IT WAS FOUND THAT SHE'D BEEN INVOLVED IN SEXUAL EXPLOITATION TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ABUSE AND AGAIN ANOTHER CASE THAT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION WAS OF BOYS WHO HAD TO REPEATED ABSENT EPIC REPEATEDLY ARE CATEGORISED AS ABSENCE BUT WERE BEING GROOMED FOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY BY ORGANISED CRIME
SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT CHILDREN CAN GO MISSING FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME BUT THOSE SHORT PERIODS OF TIME CAN BE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN A GROOMING PROCESS AND ACTUALLY WE NEED TO GET IN VERY EARLY AND THAT GROOMING PROCESS TO PREVENT HARM COMING TO CHILDREN AND THIS
CATEGORY THIS AT THIS WAY THIS IS WORKS IS NOT REALLY VERY HELPFUL OH KAY WERE WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE CHIEF CONSTABLE WHO'S THE LEAD AT THE NATIONAL POLICE CHIEFS CANCELLED ON THIS ISSUE A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME AND COFFEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHAT'S THE ECONOMIC COST OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH WOMEN STARTING THEIR OWN COMPANIES OR BUSINESS DEALS HE'S HERE WITH ROBBIE
ONE IN TEN WOMEN IN THE U.K. WANT TO START A BUSINESS BUT DON'T ACCORDING TO A SURVEY BY FACEBOOK IT SAYS HER LACK OF CONFIDENCE AND SELF BELIEF ALONG WITH FINANCIAL INSECURITY PREVENT WOMEN FROM TURNING THEIR IDEAS INTO COMPANIES THE ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORK CALCULATES THAT IF WOMEN DID FULFIL THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL AMBITIONS THEY COULD UNLOCK TEN BILLION POUNDS FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY WOMEN CURRENTLY ONLY RUN ONE FIFTH OF THE U.K.'S SMALL BUSINESSES
BARONESS MENDELSSOHN NICOLA MENDELSSOHN IS FACEBOOK'S VICE PRESIDENT FOR EUROPE THE MIDDLE EASTERN AFRICA AS TO WHAT THEIR STUDY HAD FOUND
SO WE'VE DONE A SURVEY WE'VE DONE A PIECE OF RESEARCH TO FIND OUT WHY IT IS THAT ONLY ONE IN FIVE BUSINESSES IN THE U.K. ARE ACTUALLY BEING SET UP BY WOMEN AND THE RESEARCHERS REALLY TOLD US THAT ACTUALLY IT'S AN OVERARCHING LACK OF CONFIDENCE THAT'S THE REASON THAT'S HOLDING WOMEN
MONEY IS AN ISSUE AS LOT OF COURSE FACEBOOK HAS AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHOT THERE SHOVELLING MONEY TOWARDS WOMEN IN THE U.K. YOU FANCY STARTING UP A BUSINESS ALREADY SEEING THAT ARE OVER SEVENTY PER CENT INCREASE IN WOMEN ACTUALLY SETTING UP BUSINESSES IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE SO WE WANTED TO SEE HOW WE COULD ENCOURAGE MORE WOMEN TO SET UP BUSINESSES BECAUSE ACTUALLY IF THEY DO SO THERE IS A HUGE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE THAT WILL SEE AN IMPACT THAT WILL HAPPEN THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW BUSINESSES
FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW JOBS BEING CREATED WHICH WOULD RESULT IN TEN BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY SO IF YOU'RE NOT PUTTING MONEY THEIR WAY HOW ARE YOU ENCOURAGING OR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE WOMEN TOLD US WAS ACTUALLY THAT THEY NEED PRACTICAL HELP THEY NEED WORKSHOPS THEY NEED UNDERSTANDING THEY NEED SUPPORT AND OVER HALF OF THEM TOLD US THEY ACTUALLY NEED DIGITAL AND TECH SKILLS TO HELP THEM BUILD THEIR BUSINESSES SO THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT WERE DOING WERE PARTNERING WITH THE FEDERATION FOR SMALL BUSINESS
WORKING WITH THE BRITISH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WERE MAKING ACTUAL REAL WORKSHOPS WE'VE GOT ONE GOING TODAY WE'VE GOT SIX HUNDRED SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS COMING THERE'S ONLINE LEARNING CORPORAL OR CALLED SHE MEANS BUSINESS GO OUT AND CHECK IT OUT INTO THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT YOU WANT WOMEN TO SET UP BUSINESSES ONLINE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT THEM TO BE SETTING UP A SMALL SHOP ON THE HIGH STREET OR A SMALL MANUFACTURING OUTFITS WE WON ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT SETTING UP A BUSINESS ON FACEBOOK IS THAT IT ACTUALLY GIVES YOU AN INSTANT SHOP WINDOW IT GIVES YOU AN INSTANT MOBILE STRATEGY
AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE OVER THIRTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.K. THAT ARE ON FACEBOOK YOU HAVE ACCESS NOT JUST TO PEOPLE IN THE U.K. THAT YOU CAN SELL YOUR WARES TO YOU HAVE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD ISN'T ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ABOUT HALF OF NEW BUSINESSES IN THE U.K. FAIL WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AND SO IT IS A HUGE PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL GAMBLE FOR PEOPLE
IT IS BUT WE ALSO SEE IS THE FACT THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN TARGET SO PRECISELY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE SELLING I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF KELLY WHO'S IN MIDDLESBROUGH SET UP AN ONLINE BUSINESS SELLING FASHION WHERE SHE NOW HAS A THREE MILLION TURNOVER IN JUST IN THREE YEARS SO THERE'S LOTS AND LOTS OF WONDERFUL ROLE MODELS OUT THERE ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WOMEN TOLD US WAS ACTUALLY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROLE MODELS OUT THERE NO WANT TO SEE MORE
IF INSTINCT THAT FACEBOOK SAYS IT'S TRYING TO EMPOWER WOMEN IN THE U.K. WHEN EARLIER THIS WEEK FACEBOOK HAD TO APOLOGISE FOR ESSENTIALLY BANNING A PHOTOGRAPHIC ADVERT FOR PLUS SIZE MODELS AS I SAID WE HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THE U.K. MILLIONS MILLIONS THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE EVERY DAY ON FACEBOOK MILLIONS OF ADVERTS
WE GET IT WRONG SOMETIMES WE GOT IT WRONG IN THAT RESPECT WE APOLOGISED AND THEY HAD IS BACK UP AND RUNNING THERE'S A CAMPAIGN BEING LAUNCH TODAY BY A CROSS PARTY GROUP OF M.P.S WHO ARE CALLING FOR INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES TO ACT TO DEAL WITH ONLINE MISOGYNY AND HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM DO YOU THINK THAT IS
AND SHOULD YOU BE DOING MORE TO DEAL WITH IT SO I'M AWARE OF THE WORK THAT YVETTE COOPER SPEAR HEADING TODAY I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT WE DO A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA ALREADY WORKING WITH ORGANISATIONS LIKE WOMEN'S AID THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE ON FACEBOOK FOR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT YOU DON'T TAKE DOWN
MISOGYNISTIC COMMENTS AS SOON AS I MET DID WE TAKE DOWN CONTENT WORRIED THERE'S BULLYING OR VIOLENCE OR THINGS LIKE THAT WE ABSOLUTELY DO TAKE THAT CONTENT DOWN THAT WAS FACEBOOK'S VICE PRESIDENT FOR EUROPE AND AFRICA THERE BARONESS MEDDLESOME ROBBIE THANKS VERY MUCH TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN
AS OF MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT LEGAL HIGHS WERE MADE ILLEGAL THE PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES ACT BANS THE PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION SALE AND SUPPLY OF LEGAL HIGHS SUCH A SPICED NITROUS OXIDE AND MIAOW MIAOW THE NEW LAWS BASED ON ONE IN IRELAND WHICH BAND'S ANYTHING WHICH HAS A CYCLE EFFECT ACTIVE EFFECT ON THE BRAIN APART FROM ALCOHOL NICOTINE CAFFEINE AND POPPERS
KAREN VANDA SIP AND HE'S FROM IRELAND BUT HER SON JIMMY DIED TWO YEARS AGO AFTER TAKING SPICE WHICH HE'D BOUGHT HERE IN KENT AND SHE JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW FROM LONDONDERRY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING YOU HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS LAW DO YOU THINK IF IT HAD BEEN IN PLACE JIMMY WOULD NOT HAVE DIED
I DEFINITELY FEEL JIMMY WOULD STILL BE HERE IF HE WASN'T ABLE TO HAVE WALKED INTO A SHOP TO PURCHASE THESE PRODUCTS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THIS BAN IT'S SOME SCIMITAR ONE IN IRELAND IT DOESN'T BAN THE USE OF IT IT DOESN'T MAKE THAT ILLEGAL IT'S THE SALE OF IT AND THAT'S WHERE WHAT HAPPENED TO JIMMY AND AWAY ISN'T HE WALKED INTO A SHOP TO BUY IT
HE DID HE WENT INTO A HEAD SHOP AND TO ACTUALLY BUY A T. SHIRT
HE PURCHASED HIS T. SHIRT AND THIS SYNTHETIC CANNABIS WAS AT THE COUNTER AND HE ASKED WHAT IT WAS AND THE LADY P. UNCOUNTED TOLD HIM WHAT IT WAS AND SO HE PUTS A BAG THAT UP AS WELL
CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT THE EFFECT THAT HAD ON HIM AND IT RAISED HIS BLOOD PRESSURE IS SO HIGH AND SO FAST THAT HE HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK AND HE WAS
DE FIBRILLATED AND REVIVED AND BROUGHT THAT ROUND TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BUT ON THE WAY TO HOSPITAL HE IS HIS BRAIN BEGAN TO SWELL AND IT CRUSHED HIS BRAINSTEM THEY'VE NIM BRAINDEAD
AND YOU HAD A CALLER AS I UNDERSTAND IT AT THE POINT THAT AS I THINK IT WAS THAT HE HAD BASICALLY BEEN FOUND UNCONSCIOUS
YES I HAD A CALL FROM HIS DAD TO SAY THAT HE'D BEEN FOUND UNCONSCIOUS HE PERSISTS SUSPECTED HEART ATTACK AND THAT HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO HOSPITAL AND HE WAS FINE AND TWENTY MINUTES LATER I GOT ANOTHER CALL TO SAY THAT THE PREY NOTES AT ALL AND AND CRUSH THE BRAINSTEM
AND HE WAS ON A LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE AND HOW SOON COULD I GET
AND WAS HE OPENED WITH YOU I MEAN IS HE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT WOULD HAVE POSSIBLY TAKEN IT BECAUSE IT BECAUSE IT WAS LEGAL YEAH HE CAME OUT THE SHOP THE SHOWED HIS DAD WHAT HE WELL HE WASN'T TRYING TO HIDE IT WHAT AFTER HE BOUGHT IT BEFORE HE TOOK IT
BECAUSE I SUPPOSE IN IN HIS MIND IT WAS BOUGHT IN THE SHOPS SO THEREFORE PSI
HE WASN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG HE WASN'T SORT OF SMOKE IN ANY ILLEGAL DRUG SO I DON'T SUPPOSE HE FELT HE HAD ANY NEED TO HIDE IT
THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THAT ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF THIS LAW WILL BE THAT YES IT WILL DISAPPEAR FROM THE HIGH STREET BUT AS WHAT HAPPENED IN IRELAND THEY HAVE BEEN VERY VERY FEW PROSECUTIONS IN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS HAVE GONE UP
YEAH THAT'S THAT IS CORRECT HE HAS
THESE PRODUCTS ARE STILL GOING TO BE AVAILABLE AT THE SAME AS ANY OTHER BAND PRODUCTS
SO THEREFORE EDUCATION IS PARAMOUNT BUT OVER IN ENGLAND AN ISLAND THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW WE GETS THE KIDS EARLY TO KNOW THE DANGERS SO THEY CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION FOR THEMSELVES BUT YOU'RE STILL YOUR PLEASE THIS LAW HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN WE ARE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED IT HAS COME INTO EFFECT
IT'S JUST A SHAME THAT WE SORT OF PAID SUCH A HIGH PRICE FOR FOR HAVING IT
I HAD HADN'T HEARD OF LEGAL HIGHS AND HAD VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ON THEM UNTIL THIS HAPPENED TO JIMMY WELL KAREN TO SIP AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THANK YOU VERY MUCH

QUICK LOOK AT THE WEATHER WARMER IN THE SOUTH CLOUDIER AND COOLER FURTHER NORTH YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S NOW HALF PAST SEVEN LET'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THE GOVERNMENT IS BEING WORN WITH A PLAN TO CUT BENEFITS FOR THE OLD BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME TO HELP SAVE TATA STEEL'S U.K. OPERATIONS COULD TAKE MINISTERS DOWN A DANGEROUS PATH THE PROPOSALS WOULD BASED PENSION INCREASES ON THE CONSUMER PRICE INFLATION MEASURE RATHER THAN THE RETAIL PRICE INDEX WHICH IS USUALLY HIRE THE FORMER PENSIONS MINISTER STEVE WEBB SAYS RUSH CHANGES TO PENSION RULES RISK DRIVING A COACH AND HORSES THROUGH THE SECURITY OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS
IMMIGRATION IS LIKELY TO BE THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AS THE FINAL SET OF OFFICIAL MIGRATION FIGURES BEFORE THE POLL THE PUBLISHED THE FORMER HOME SECRETARY LORD BLUNKETT WHO SUPPORTS THE REMAIN SIDE WILL SAY IT WOULD BE A CALAMITY OF BRITAIN WAS FORCED TO ABANDON ITS BORDER CONTROLS IN CALAIS BUT THE EURO SCEPTIC FORMER SHADOW HOME SECRETARY DAVID DAVIS WILL SAY THAT BRITISH WORKERS HAVE LOST OUT AS A RESULT OF THE E.U. MEMBERSHIP
THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE DONALD TUSK HAS CALLED FOR GLOBAL HELP IN DEALING WITH THE MIGRANT CRISIS SPEAKING AT A SUMMIT OF THE G.SEVEN GROUP OF INDUSTRIALISED NATIONS IN JAPAN HE SAID MORE ASSISTANCE WAS NEEDED TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES LIKE TURKEY JORDAN AND LEBANON THAT WERE HOSTING THE MOST REFUGEES
THE SPENDING WATCHDOG IS CALLING FOR RADICAL ACTION OVER DELAYS AND DISCHARGING PATIENTS WHO ARE READY TO LEAVE HOSPITAL THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS PEOPLE BEING KEPT IN HOSPITAL UNNECESSARILY COSTS THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR
NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CAUSED A SHARP INCREASE IN CANCER RELATED DEATHS IN THE THIRTY FIVE MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE STUDY IDENTIFIED AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND DEATHS IN THE FOLLOWING TWO YEARS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND REDUCED HEALTH SPENDING
A CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN LAUNCHED THIS MORNING TO TACKLE ONLINE ABUSE AND RECLAIM THE INTERNET AND PEAS THE GIRL GUIDES AND MUM'S NET ARE AMONG THOSE BACKING THE INITIATIVE TO TACKLE SEXISM RACISM AND OTHER ONLINE INTIMIDATION
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT H. S. TWO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE BEING BUILT BETWEEN LONDON AND BIRMINGHAM AND MANCHESTER IS COSTING FIVE TIMES AS MUCH TO BUILD AS THE LATEST HIGH SPEED T.G.V. RAIL LINE BEING BUILT IN FRANCE THAT'S THE FINDING OF A GROUP OF INDEPENDENT TRANSPORT EXPERTS AND THEY SAY THAT OF ITS FOUR OBJECTIVES TO INCREASE CAPACITY
IMPROVE CONNECTIONS REGENERATE THE NORTH AND REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE IT WILL ONLY ACHIEVE ONE OF THOSE AN INCREASE IN CAPACITY
WE'RE JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY GILES THOMAS WHO IS TECHNICAL DIRECTOR OF H. S. TWO GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SIR LET'S START WITH THAT QUESTION OF COST FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AS FRANCE NOW ON THE ONE HAND
IT'S OBVIOUS BUT IF YOU'RE BUYING LAND IN THE U.K. NOT LEAST IN SOMEWHERE LIKE USED AND IT'S GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN PARTS OF RURAL FRANCE BUT THE SUGGESTION FROM THIS SEEMS TO BE THAT IMPART THE REASON IT'S COST SO MUCH MORE IS BECAUSE YOU'RE SET ON THIS FASTER SPEED WHICH ISN'T NECESSARY
O.K. WELL LET'S TAKE THIS IN STEPS I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO BE COMPARING APPLES WITH WITH APPLES NOT APPLES WITH PEARS
THE T.G.V. EXTENSION IS AN EXTENSION TO A CURRENT LINE AND THEY IT'S TRUE THAT THE FRENCH HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE OF BUILDING HIGH SPEED LINES I THINK THERE ARE SEVEN THOUSAND KILOMETRES OF HIGH SPEED LINE IN EUROPE AND WE OURSELVES HAVE ONE HUNDRED KILOMETRES SO OF COURSE WE'RE LEARNING WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY LEARNING FROM THE FRENCH AND FROM OTHERS AROUND EUROPE ABOUT THE COSTS OF A OF A SYSTEM
BUT IF IF YOU COMPARE COOKED CORRECTLY THE LINE EXTENSION DOESN'T HAVE ANY STATIONS THEY'RE RUNNING OFF INTO THE RUNNING OFF INTO EXISTING STATIONS WHEREAS HIGH SPEED TWO IS OF COURSE A NETWORK WHICH COMPRISES OF TEN NEW STATIONS
IT'S ALSO AS YOU SAID EARLIER GOING THROUGH SOME VERY EXPENSIVE PARTS OF THE OF OF THE U.K. IN A MUCH MORE DENSE ENVIRONMENT AND OF COURSE THE COSTS THAT WE ARE QUOTING INCLUDE ROLLING STOCK AS WELL WHICH
THE T. G. V. LINE DOESN'T PROFESSOR TONY MAY WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM EARLIER MADE THE POINT LOOK WE'RE NOT COMPARING LIKE WITH LIKE BUT PART OF THAT COST IS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SET ON RUNNING IT ULTRA FAST AT TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILES AN HOUR RATHER THAN ONE HUNDRED NINETY MILES AN HOUR AND ON COST GROUNDS AND ACTUALLY GOES ON ON ENVIRONMENTAL GROUNDS BUT JUST TAKE THE COST ONE IT'S NOT WORTH IT WELL WE ARE DESIGNING FOR THE FUTURE OF COURSE WE NEED TO BECAUSE
WE LOOK AROUND THE WORLD AND WE SEE THAT OTHER RAILWAYS IN JAPAN AND CHINA AND INDEED IN EUROPE ARE ALL SPLIT STARTED TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF SPEED SO NOBODY WOULD THANK US IF WE ENDED UP BUILDING A RAILWAY WHICH CAME INTO SERVICE IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX WHICH ACTUALLY COULDN'T THEN BE ADAPTED TO FUTURE TECHNOLOGY
AS AS TRAINS AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPS WE WILL BE ABLE TO GO FASTER AND NOT GENERATE AS MUCH NOISE BUT BUT WHAT AS ONE OF YOUR OBJECT ESTATES AN ENTIRELY UNDERSTANDABLE ONE ONE OF THE AIMS IS TO REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE AND BECAUSE OF THAT SPEED YOU ARE IT WILL NOT DO THAT WELL THE ROUTE OF COURSE INTO THE FACT THAT THE STRAIGHTER THE TO THE MORE DIRECT THE ROUTE THE LESS IMPACT IN MANY WAYS WE HAVE ON THE ACTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE COUNTRYSIDE
SO WE'VE REALLY SET ABOUT TRYING TO BALANCE THE NEEDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE AND THE BENEFITS THAT H. HAS TWO OFFERS AS WE PROVIDE SOME FANTASTIC JOURNEY TIMES UP TO MANCHESTER IN ONE HOUR EIGHT MINUTES LEEDS IN ONE HOUR TWENTY THREE BUT IN A WAY I COULD ASK THE SAME QUESTION AGAIN WHICH IS ABOUT THIS EXTRA SPEED BECAUSE AT THAT SORT OF SPEED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN TWO HUNDRED FORTY YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY SAVING THAT MUCH TIME
WELL WE ARE WE WE FIRST OR YOU ARE SAILING TIME THE FURTHER YOU GO THE MORE TIME YOU END UP SAVING BUT THE EXTRA SPEED
THE DESIGN WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD IS EFFECTIVELY FOR THE FUTURE THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED KILOMETRES PER HOUR OR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILES PER HOUR IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WEAK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PHYSICS ALLOWS THAT BUT WHEN WE GO INTO OPERATION WILL START AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR OR THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY KILOMETRES
AND YES THAT IS FASTER THAN WE SEE IN OTHER COUNTRIES BUT AT THE MOMENT WE THINK THE TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW US TO DO THAT AS EFFICIENTLY AND BITCH AND YOU ACCEPT THAT THE PRICE FOR HAVING THOSE EXTRA A FEW MINUTES OFF THE JOURNEY TIME UP THE COST OF THAT THE PRICE OF THAT IS TO BE PAY BOTH FINANCIALLY
AND IN LESS AND LESS GREEN RESULT NO PERHAPS I HAVEN'T MADE MY CASE CLEARLY ENOUGH I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ALIGNMENT OF THREE HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY KILOMETRES PER HOUR THE DIFFERENCE IS SO SMALL THAT ONE WOULD WANT TO INVEST THAT EXTRA MONEY AND HE DID
WE WERE ASKED BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCES IN SPEED AS PART OF A CONSULTATION AND WE DECIDED WE WOULDN'T CHANGE THE ROUTE ALIGNMENT AT ALL AS A RESULT OF THAT ONE OF THE OTHER CRITICISMS IS THAT IT'S SETTING OUT TO IMPROVE CONNECTIONS AND JET AND REGENERATE THE NORTH BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT PARTLY BECAUSE AS THEY MAKE THE POINT THAT YES IT'LL BE GREAT FOR PEOPLE IN LONDON AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IS EFFECTIVELY A BETTER CONNECTED NEW LINE FROM LONDON BUT IT'S NOT INVESTMENT IN THE NORTH IT'S RATHER TO THE NORTH
WELL I DISAGREE I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHICH WILL ALLOW SO MUCH MORE CAPACITY TO BE PROVIDED THAT THE CONVENTIONAL NETWORK WILL BE FREED UP AND CHOICES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT CITIES AND IN A FAR MORE EFFICIENT WAY SO NOTTINGHAM STOCKPORT WAKEFIELD SERVICES THEY WILL SUFFER BUT THAT'S THAT'S A PRICE NO I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE PROPER CHOICES AND OF COURSE IN THE BUDGET IN TWENTY SIXTEEN
MONEY WAS BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR NORTHERN CITIES TO BE ABLE TO START TO CONSIDER EXACTLY HOW TO ACTUALLY BAKE THE MOST BENEFIT OF THE CONNECTIONS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE CHARLES THOMAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE PAPERS MANY OF THEM FEATURE THOSE STARTLING IMAGES OF THE MOMENT ABOUT FILLED WITH MIGRANTS CAPSIZED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WILL BE HEARING FROM THE ITALIAN NAVY COMMANDER JUST AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK THE SCENE OR PEOPLE TUMBLING INTO THE SEA IS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TELEGRAPH THE GUARDIAN
THE TIMES AND THE SUN AND THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE PHOTOS TAKEN BY THE ITALIAN NAVY WHICH WENT TO THE MIGRANTS RESCUE SHOW PEOPLE SWIMMING FOR THEIR LIVES IN THE BOAT ABOUT TO TOPPLE OVER THEM THE SUN DESCRIBES HOW THE RAMSHACKLE VESSEL HAD ONLY TRAVELLED EIGHTEEN MILES FROM THE LIBYAN COAST WHEN IT TIPPED OVER COASTGUARDS TELL THE PAPER THE INSTANT MARKS THE START OF THE SUMMER SURGE OF MIGRANTS ATTEMPTING TO REACH THE E.U.

WE PUT EXTRA STRAIN ON PUBLIC SERVICES AS THE REFERENDUM DEBATE RUMBLES ON THE DAILY MAIL IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES USE THEIR EDITORIALS TO REFLECT I'M HAPPILY ON THE TONE IN WHICH IT'S BEING CONDUCTED THE MALE ACCUSES DAVID CAMERON OF HYSTERICAL SCAREMONGERING ON THE PART OF REMAIN SUGGESTING HE'S DIMINISHING HIMSELF IN THE DIGNITY OF HIS POSITION THE F.

THE GOVERNMENT'S MISSING IT IMMIGRATION TARGET THAT MUCH WE ALREADY KNOW BY EXACTLY HOW MUCH THEY'RE MISSING IT WILL LEARN LATER TODAY THE RELEASE OF THE LATEST STATISTICS IS CERTAIN TO FUEL THE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER LEAVING THE Y. U. IS THE ONLY WAY TO REGAIN CONTROL NOT JUST OF HOW MANY PEOPLE COME INTO THE COUNTRY BUT TO PRECISELY
A DEBATE HAS BEEN FUELLED BY AN ARGUMENT BUT WHO SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COME HERE TO COOK UP THE NATION'S FAVOURITE DISH
DAVID WELL DONE ALMAN
THIS DOCUMENT THOSE ARE ALL THE INGREDIENTS NOT JUST IN A GREAT BRITISH CURRY BIG COCKED UP HERE
BUT IN A ROW THAT'S BUBBLING IN THE KITCHENS OF INDIAN RESTAURANTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ARE RATHER BEGINS WITH WHERE THE NATION'S CURRY CHEFS COME FROM AND IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE ANSWER
YOU MAY NEED TO THINK
HE'S ALREADY SURE BRIAN YEAH MATE HONEST I DON'T WHAT
YEP I HAVE HIS SPEND IS THAT FOR ME FOR DECADES YOU CHICKEN TO KILL YOUR VINDALOO WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY COOKED BY SOMEONE FROM BANGLADESH PERHAPS SOMEONE WHOSE FATHER WAS NODDY
THE VOICES YOU HEAR ABOVE THE CHOPPING THEM THE SIZZLING ARE INCREASINGLY FROM EASTERN EUROPE AS PEOPLE BORN HERE DON'T WANT THEIR JOBS
TOUGHER IMMIGRATION RULES MEANS IT SIMPLY COST TOO MUCH TO BRING NEW CHEFS
FROM BANGLADESH PRESSURE CANDOUR CAR IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANGLADESH CATERERS ASSOC
WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE BRITISH MINISTERS TO M. PLAYED EUROPEAN UNION PEOPLES AND YOU'D HAVE BEEN UNION PEOPLES WE WILL COME
ESPECIALLY WE GOT SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE INTERESTED THE WORLD FROM ROMANIA AND BULGARIA BUT THEY'RE NEVER THERE NEVER STATE I DON'T BLAME THEM THERE'S A LANGUAGE PROBLEM CULTURE PROBLEM AND MAINLY THE SMELL PROBLEM FOR THEM IS BED CANNOT SEND IN THE CHRISTMAS SO WHAT CAN I GET THIS PEOPLE
SO IF A J.P. MORGAN CAME BRINGEN SKILLED PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OR BIG BROTHERS CAN DO IT WHY NOT FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS WISE A DOUBLE STANDARD FOR THE IMMIGRATION POLICY
HOW DOES YOUR EXPERIENCE AS SOMEONE RUNNING A CHAIN OF CURRY SHOPS HOW'S YOUR EXPERIENCE AFFECT YOUR ATTITUDE AS TO WHETHER WE SHOULD LEAVE OR STAY IN THE YEAR WE SHOULD LEAVE BECAUSE HE BLAME UNIONS ARE CREATING MANY PRESSURE
SPECIALLY FOR THE MIGRATION WE COULD HAVE A BETTER MUCH BETTER SKILLED PEOPLE FROM ABROAD WE HAVE TO GIVE CHANCE FROM EVERYBODY IN THIS WILD WAS FIT FOR THE JOB'S NOT FOR COLOUR NOT FOR THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL I DIDN'T IT
DO YOU TEACH THESE GUYS HOW TO COOK THESE
COME ON THEN COME ON NICE BIG ENGLISH MISS BE GOOD AT THE ROMAGNA YOU SPEAK REMAIN BEHIND
GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF RUBY FOR COLOURS PICK SOMEBODY TO GET
AND WE'RE GOING TO GIVE ME A BOY WHO REMIND AND THEN LIVE IN THEIR BOOK SOMEBODY MAGNET BUT
WHAT DO I DO MY BEST AND WHATEVER WE DON'T GIVE ME
WHY SHOULD IT BE EASIER WHY SHOULD IT BE CHEAPER TO HIRE A ROMANIAN TO WORK IN A CURRY HOUSE KITCHEN
BANGLADESH IT'S A QUESTION MANY BRITISH ASIANS ASK MANY BELIEVE THAT IMMIGRATION RULES NOW DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AND FEED THEM
FROM SOUTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE
O.K. UM TELL ARRIVES WHERE SHRUB IN EPSOM MY NAME'S JEFFREY
BEEN HERE SINCE I WAS FIFTEEN THE RESTAURANT HAS BEEN HERE FOR TWENTY SEVEN
FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND THIS IS HOW EXCELLENT BUT IT IS BECOMING HARDER AND HARDER FOR YOU TO FOLLOW IN THEIR CHEFS TO MAKE THE FOOD
SO BUSINESS WHO WANTS TO BRING IN ANYONE FROM SORT OF THE STORAGE OCCUPATION LESS THEY HAVE TO PAY A FEE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SPONSOR LIE SINCE AND THIS WAY YOU SPONSOR A MIGRANT FROM
WITHIN OUTSIDE WOMEN A KIND OF COMMON MILES TO COME AND WORK IN THE KITCHEN
BEING ABLE TO GET THE LICENCE NOW IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TASK ESPECIALLY FOR A RESTAURANT WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY INDIAN RESTAURANT SECTOR I HAVING THIS SPOT A LICENCE THERE'S SO MUCH RED TAPE
AND IT'S NOT JUST GETTING THE LICENCE BUT THERE'S NOW A MINIMUM SALARY SO THERE'S A BIG CHANGE IN RELATIVELY RECENT TIMES THEY HAVE TO PAY A MINIMUM SALARY TO GET SOMEONE TO WORK IN YOUR KITSCH YET THERE'S MILLIGAN CELERY I REMEMBER IT USED TO BE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PER ANNUM AND IT'S GONE UP TO THIRTY THIRTY THOUSAND EVERY YEAR
KAREESHA THIRTY THOUSAND PER YEAR AS WELL AS OTHER OTHER CRITERION TOUCHES NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE TAKE WAITING TO PROVIDE TAKEAWAY SO AS WELL AS BEING ASKED THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY THIS
THIRTY THOUSAND YOU CAN'T EVEN SUPPLEMENT THE EXTRA MONEY BY OFFERING TAKEAWAY SERVICES BUT IF WE LEFT THE E.U.
MAGICALLY OVERNIGHT NO ROMANIANS OR POLES OR BULGARIANS CAME DO YOU THINK IT WOULD CERTAINLY GET EASIER
FOR PEOPLE FROM YOUR COMMUNITY IN THE BANGLADESHI COMMUNITY TO COME HERE I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GET ANY EASIER AT ALL RIGHT NOW IMMIGRATION IS SOMETHING THAT NO MINISTER REALLY WANTS A TOUCH SO FINALLY YOUR DECISION THEREFORE IN THE REFERENDUM
MY DECISION WOULD BE TO STAY IN BECAUSE HAD WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO TAP INTO THEIR EASTERN EUROPEAN SECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY WHO WERE WILLING TO DO THE JOBS THAT BRITISH PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO DO SO WE HAVE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS WHO ARE CUMIN COMING IN WORKING HARD AND TH OF FILLING THE VACANCIES THAT OTHERWISE RIGHT NOW I THINK THE RESTAURANT WOULD BE CLOSED BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE STAFF THAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO THOSE JOBS THAT AREN'T WILLING TO DO
THE BENTLEY CAMPAIGN HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO CLAIM THAT A VOTE TOOK WHITNEY YOU WITH SEE
WOULD ONLY BE TRUE THOUGH IF THE BRITISH PEOPLE WANTED THEIR POLITICIANS TO RELAX THE IMMIGRATION RULES TO ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO COME HERE FROM OUTSIDE
AND THE PROPER WOOD THAT IS EVEN IF YOU COULD SWITCH OF E.U. IMMIGRATION JUST LIKE
THERE'S STILL AN AWFUL LOT MORE PEOPLE COMING HERE THE MOST FACTORS TO SAVE PEOPLE
STOPPING FOR CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION THAT'S THE MAIN REASON PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE LEAVE GIVE FOR CHOOSING TO VOTE THAT WAY BUT EVEN IF WE DID
THE DEBATE ABOUT WHO WE WANT TO HEAR HOW MANY WE WANT TO HEAR WHAT JOBS WE WANT PEOPLE TO DO
ONLY JUST BE BEGINNING THE MIND
AND THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN A LONDON THROUGH THIS MORNING'S ELIZABETH OLDFIELD HE'S DIRECTOR OF THEOS THEIR RELIGION AND SOCIETY THINK TANK OF MORNING GOOD MORNING
THIS WEEK A PLAY CALLED INCOGNITO OPENED IN NEW YORK THE SCRIPT IS BY NICK PAIN HE'S BEEN HAILED AS THE NEW TOM STOPPARD A GIANT OF INTELLECTUAL THEATRE
IT FOCUSES ON THE VERY TOPICAL THEME OF IDENTITY
DRAWING ON FOUR STOREYS AND MORE THAN TWENTY CHARACTERS THE PLAY EXPLORES WHAT NEUROSCIENCE IS TELLING US ABOUT HOW OUR BRAINS WORK AND ECHOES WITH ONE OF HUMANITY'S DEEPEST QUESTIONS WHO AM I
THE PLAY'S CENTRAL CONCERN IS WHERE OUR SENSE OF SELF COMES FROM IS IT JUST A COLLECTION OF MEMORIES AND MENTAL WORK AROUND IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT US THAT'S INTRINSIC ALWAYS SIMPLY A JUMBLED FILING SYSTEM OF INFORMATION AND INFLUENCES THE NEW YORK TIMES AS THE PLAY CHALLENGES OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL NOTIONS OF AUTONOMOUS SELFHOOD
WE LIVE IN AN AGE THAT'S FASCINATED BY IDENTITY AND IT'S CURRENTLY SHOWING UP MOST CLEARLY IN DEBATE AROUND GENDER IDENTITY
I NEXT CENSUS MAY ASK ABOUT IT AND WHAT SOCIAL MEDIA SITE CURRENTLY GIVES U.K. USERS DOZENS OF OPTIONS FROM WHICH TO SELECT THEIR GENDER SELF DEFINITION
UNDERSTANDING HERE WE ARE IS A DEEP AND HEALTHY HUMAN NEED AND A TASK THAT WE INSTINCTIVELY FEEL WILL LEAD TO FLOURISHING
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH FINDING THE RIGHT LANGUAGE A LABEL BETTER UNDERSTANDING OUR BRAINS I'M PACKING OUR PASTS THERE HOPE FOR MANY IS THAT IF WE REALLY KNOW WHO WE ARE PERHAPS WE WILL FEEL AT HOME IN OUR SKINS
LOTS OF THESE ARE IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTION OF IDENTITY
CHRISTIANITY OFFERS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE PROJECT OF WORKING OUT OUR TRUE SELVES PARADOXICALLY CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THAT WE FIND A STABLE SENSE OF SELF NOT OR NOT SOLELY BY GAZING INWARDS BUT BY TURNING OUT BEYOND OURSELVES
THE OLOGY STARTING POINT FOR IDENTITY IS THAT ALL HUMANS ARE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF A TRINITARIAN GOD
IF GOD IS TRINITY THAT HIS FATHER SON AND HOLY SPIRIT FUNDAMENTALLY RELATIONAL AND SO ARE WE
INTERESTINGLY NEUROSCIENCE SCIENCE ITSELF TO SOME EXTENT CONFIRMS THIS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE BRAIN IS INTENSELY SOCIAL IT'S VERY MATTER IS FORMED AND MOULDED BY THE HUMAN CONNECTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE EMBEDDED BABIES' BRAINS LITERALLY TAKE SHAPE WHEN THEY EXPERIENCE LOVING INTERACTION
IN THE WORDS OF AN OLD MOBILE PHONE ADVERT THEN I AM WHO I AM BECAUSE OF EVERYONE ELSE
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND HERSELF EXCEPT IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHERS AND THEREFORE THE UNVEILING OF OURSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS CAN ONLY GET US SO FAR
JESUS SUMS UP THIS PARADOX SAYING IT'S ONLY WHEN WE ARE WILLING TO LOSE OURSELVES IN SERVICE AND RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A TRUE SELF CAN BE FOUND
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH ELIZABETH OLDFIELD IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT CUTS WORKERS' PENSIONS TO SAVE THEIR JOBS AND TO SAVE A VITAL BRITISH INDUSTRY THAT IN ESSENCE IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANNING IN THEIR EFFORTS TO FIND A BUYER FOR TATA STEEL AND TO KEEP THAT MILLER PORT TALBOT OPEN LATER TODAY MINISTERS WILL UNVEIL A PROPOSAL TO CHANGE THE LAW TO TACKLE THE NEARLY HALF A BILLION POUND DEFICIT IN THE STEELWORKERS PENSION SCHEME
THE SELLERS WANT IT TO HAPPEN THE POTENTIAL BUYERS WANTED TO HAPPEN THE WORKERS TO A IT SEEMS PREPARED TO STOMACH IT BUT THERE ARE WARNINGS TODAY THAT IT SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR THE PENSIONS OF PEOPLE IN OTHER INDUSTRIES IN A MOMENT WE'LL HEAR FROM STEVE WEBB RUSE ISSUED THAT WARNING HE WAS OF COURSE THE PENSIONS MINISTER IN THE LAST
GOVERNMENT DURING HIS FIRST THEY SIMON JACK A BUSINESS EDITOR NOW WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE DEAL BUT IS ON THE TABLE SON WILL THIS IS THE OLD BRITISH STEEL PENSION FUND IT'S A GIANT PENSION SCHEME IT'S FIFTEEN BILLION POUNDS WORTH IT'S GOT A DEFICIT IS YOU SAY A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND MEMBERS IT IS A DEAL BREAKER TO ANY POTENTIAL BUYER SO WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT WELL THE PLAN TODAY IS TO REDUCE THE INCREASE IN BENEFITS BY THE SMALLER INFLATION MEASURE C.P.I. RATHER THAN THE LARGER MEASURE
A P.I. WHAT DOES THAT GET YOU THAT GETS RID OF ABOUT TWO AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS' WORTH OF THE LIABILITIES BUT IT WOULD REDUCE BENEFITS MEMBERS IN FUTURE YEARS ON THE SURFACE THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE MANY PENSION SCHEMES HAVE AD PRECISELY THAT CHANGE HERE AT THE B.B.C. FOR EXAMPLE OF THE PARTS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR MANY MANY PRIVATE FIRMS HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM APIA
BUT NOT WHEN YOU'VE GOT EXISTING PENSION SCHEME MEMBERS SO IT'S FINE FOR GOING FORWARD BUT THIS WOULD BE A CHANGE AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE THE WEB WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM IS SAYING IT'S A DANGEROUS MOVE BUT OUI OUI I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME UNION LEADERS ARE WELL PREPARED TO ACCEPT THIS BECAUSE IT'S BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS TO SEE THIS SLIDE INTO THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND WHERE BENEFITS WOULD BE REDUCED BY EVEN MORE
AND THAT THAT WOULD BE SO THEY'RE SAYING LOOK AT AND ALSO IT WILL BE SUCH AN UNWIELDY FUNDS TO GO INTO THE P. P. F. IT MIGHT START TO WAY DOWN THAT LIFEBOAT SO STEVE WEBB JOIN IS NOW ON THE LINE FROM WESTMINSTER WHY IF THE WORKERS ARE PREPARED TO PUT UP WITH IT WHY IF THAT UNION REPRESENTATIVES OR PREPARED TO PUT UP FOR IT ARE YOU SAYING DON'T DO IT
I THINK NOBODY DOUBTS THE GOVERNMENT'S MOTIVES OR NO HE DOESN'T WANT TO TRY AND SAVE STEEL JOBS THE WORRY IS THE KNOCK ON EFFECT OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE RUSHED LEGISLATION THIS IS A COMPLEX AREA THE SISTEMA PROTECTING PENSIONS HAS BUILT UP OVER MANY YEARS AND IF SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING WITH THE BEST INTENTION TO TRY AND TACKLE A SHORT TERM CRISIS THE DANGER IS THAT THIS DOESN'T JUST AFFECT ONE PENSION IT AFFECTS MANY AFFECTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND ONCE SHE BREAKS THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PENSION RIGHT YOU'VE BUILT UP IS YOURS IS SACROSANCT
THEN THAT CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF WHAT WE DO AND COULD HAVE RIPPLE EFFECTS THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THE SUGGESTION IS THAT THE LEGISLATION WILL ACTUALLY SAY THAT THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN IN AN EMERGENCY HOW DEFINED AS AN INTERESTING QUESTION OF COURSE AND ALSO THAT THE TRUSTEES WOULD HAVE TO APPLY TO A COURT FOR PERMISSION TO MAKE THE CHANGE DO YOU NOT THINK THOSE ARE ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS IT ALL HELPS BUT OF COURSE EMERGENCIES AS YOU SAY HE IS ILL DEFINED FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS AGO
PERHAPS THERE WASN'T AN EMERGENCY NO THERE IS A TATTER IF YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER EMPLOYER WHO'S PERHAPS FINDING THINGS DIFFICULT STRUGGLING TO MEET THE PENSION LIABILITIES COULD THEY ARTIFICIALLY CREATE AN EMERGENCY ONCE WANT SOMETHING SO CAN YOU GET THIS TERRIBLE MORAL HAZARD THAT PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO WALK AWAY FROM THEIR PENSION PROMISES SUDDENLY SEE A ROUTE TO DO SO OBVIOUSLY THE COURTS COULD BE PART OF THIS PROCESS I THINK WE COULD BE LEGAL CHALLENGE EUROPEAN CONVENTION WRITES ON PROPERTY
AND IF THIS WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM PEOPLE IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF THIS ENDED UP IN THE COURTS AND TOOK A VERY LONG TIME AND I JUST THINK IF YOU THINK THAT SOME LIKE THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT YOU KNOW WELL MEANING LEGISLATION IN RESPONSE TO OUTRAGE AND WE LOOK BACK NOW AND THINK THAT WAS RUSHED IT WAS BAD LEGISLATION AND MY WORRY IS THE SAME THING COULD HAPPEN AGAIN HERE NOW WE'VE HEARD IN MANY INDUSTRIES NOT LEAST FROM THE COLLAPSE OF B.H.S. AT THE MOMENT THE PENSIONS ARE A MAJOR PROBLEM
OVERALL IS YOUR ANXIETY THAT THERE ARE MANY OWNERS OUT THERE WHO WOULD LOVE TO GET OUT OF THEIR PENSION LIABILITIES AND WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A LEGAL ROUTE TO DO IT ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THE THE SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THESE SALARY RELATED PENSION SCHEMES ARE IN DEFICIT BE CUMULATIVE DEFICIT RUNS INTO HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF POUNDS AND MANY OF THE BUSINESSES FOR EXAMPLE WOULD LIKE TO
THEIR OWNERS WOULD LIKE TO SELL THEM THEY CAN'T SELL THEM BECAUSE OF THAT THE PENSION PROMISES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND ONCE IT BECOMES APPARENT ONCE AS A PRESTON ONCE THERE'S A LOOPHOLE THAT SAYS ACTUALLY YOU KNOW YOU CAN WALK AWAY FROM SOME OF THE PENSION PROMISES YOU'VE MADE ONCE THAT RUBY CAN HE'S CROSSED THEN THERE IS A DANGER THAT THE NEXT FIRM COMES ALONG THIS IS WE'RE A SPECIAL CASE IF STEELE IS IMPORTANT SOUTH WALES HOW ABOUT THE MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES WHERE THE SORTS OF PENSION SCHEMES APPLIANCE THAT REALLY IS THE WORRY FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT
THE NEED TO KEEP PENSION PROMISES SOME IN THERE EST SUGGESTION SIMON JET THAT THERE ARE SOME IN GOVERNMENT STILL WHO HAVE SOME OF THESE ANXIETIES THAT THIS IN OTHER WORDS MAY BE VERY FAVOURED BY THE BUSINESS DEPARTMENT DESPERATE TO FIND A BUYER FOR TATA STEEL BUT OTHERS ARE SHARE STEVE WEBB CONCERN WE KNOW THE DEMOGRAPHIC PICTURE IS THAT THAT THESE PENSION LIABILITIES ARE GETTING BIGGER WE ARE LIVING LONGER AND SAYS SOMETHING WE'RE SEEING IT BECOME A REAL FEATURE OF BUSINESS LIFE AS WELL AS PUBLIC I'VE GOT A FUND A PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS AS WELL
THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN GET GET RID OF THEM IS A REAL MORAL HAZARD THE REASON THEIR PENSIONS REGULATOR WAS INVENTED WAS TO TRY AND BE THE GOALKEEPER TO STOP PEOPLE SHOVING THIS STUFF IN THE BACK OF THE PENSIONS PROTECTION NET AND THERE IS ONE OTHER POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE JOHN RALPH WHO WE HAD ON EARLIER TODAY SAID
DOING A DEAL LIKE THIS MIGHT EVEN FALL FOUL OF STATE AID RULES THAT HAS TO BE WORKED OUT AS WELL VERY VERY FINAL WORD STEVE WEBB HOW MUCH WORSE WOULD BE THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE THOSE STEEL STEELWORKERS JUST IN TEN SECONDS SO SOME REASSURANCE IS A GOOD SCHEME IT'S WELL RUN BUT TODAY'S WORKERS WOULD SEE TEN PER CENT LESS PENSIONS MORE INFLATION PROTECTION WAS ERODED
STEVE WEBB AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED SO I'M INJECTED THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR WEATHER FORECAST PHIL AVERY'S HERE AGAIN HELLO PHIL I SARAH THANKS VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING THIS SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND PROBABLY SEEING SOME OF THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE AROUND AT THE MOMENT ARE LIKELY STAY THAT WAY FOR A GOOD PART OF THE DAY THOUGH AS THE HEAT POURS THROUGH IT WILL BE A WARMER DAY THAN WAS THE CASE YESTERDAY HE MIGHT JUST POP OFF SOME SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON ONE OR TWO OF THOSE COULD BE ON THE SHARP SIDE
MID TEENS CERTAINLY MAYBE TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE IN SUMMER IN THE SOUTH EASTERN QUARTER KNOWS WHO MOVE THROUGH TO WALES THE MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLIA CLOUDY START HERE AS WELL BUT I THINK THERE WILL BE SOME SENSE OF THE CLOUD LIFTING AND BREAKING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND YOU WILL GET TO SEE WEE BIT OF SUNSHINE IT SHOULD BE ESSENTIALLY A DRY DAY WE'RE LOOKING AGAIN AT THE TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TEENS

STUCK IF YOU'RE LUCKY AROUND ABOUT SORT OF TWELVE OR THIRTEEN DEGREES NORTH OF THE CENTRAL BELT WEATHER SOME SUNSHINE TO BE HAD HERE YOU MAY BE ROBBED OF THAT TOWARDS EVENING AS SOME OF THIS CLOUD MOVES UP FROM THE SOUTH BUT ESSENTIALLY IT'S A DRY DAY WITH SOME SUNSHINE THE CLOUD IS STILL THERE TO BE HAD AS WAS THE CASE YESTERDAY ROUND ABOUT THE MORAY FIRTH AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A HIGH IN THE WEST OF SEVENTEEN OF NORTHERN ISLES ELEVEN OR TWELVE OVERNIGHT

GOOD MORNING IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE TWENTY SIXTH OF MAY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING MINISTERS ARE TO SET OUR PROPOSALS TO CHANGE THE LAW ON PENSIONS TO HELP FIND A BUYER FOR TATA STEEL'S U.K. BUSINESS
THE TWO SIDES IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WILL FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION TODAY AS THE LATEST MIGRATION FIGURES ARE PUBLISHED A U.S. GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG AS AMERICA'S NUCLEAR FORCES ARE RELIANT ON OUTDATED COMPUTERS INCLUDING SOME USING FLOPPY DISCS THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THE GOVERNMENT IS TO MAKE A COMMON STATEMENT ON ITS PLANS TO CHANGE THE LAW ON PENSIONS IN A BID TO HELP SAVE THE JOBS OF THOUSANDS OF STEELWORKERS MINISTERS HOPE POTENTIAL BUYERS HAVE TATA STEEL'S U.K. OPERATIONS WILL FIND THE BUSINESS MORE ATTRACTIVE THE LIABILITIES OF THE OLD BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME RUN BY TATA A REDUCED THEY PROPOSED BASING FUTURE ANNUAL INCREASES IN PENSION PAYMENTS ON AN INFLATION MEASURE WHICH IS USUALLY LOWER THAN THE ONE CURRENTLY USE IT AS A BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK
THE FIFTEEN BILLION POUND PENSION FUND AND IT'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUND DEFICIT HAS BEEN A DEAL BREAKER FOR ANY WOULD BE BUYERS IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT IN THE COMMONS MINISTERS WILL ANNOUNCE A CONSULTATION THAT COULD REDUCE FUTURE BENEFITS BY CHANGING THE ANNUAL INCREASE FROM THE CURRENT RETAIL PRICE MEASURE OF INFLATION TO THE USUALLY LOWER CONSUMER PRICE MEASURE FORMER PENSIONS MINISTER STEVE WEBB HAS DESCRIBED THE MOVE AS SETTING A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT BUT THE B.B.C. UNDERSTANDS THAT SOME UNION LEADERS HAVE ACCEPTED THIS PROPOSAL IS A BETTER DEAL FOR MEMBERS
THEN SEEING THE PENSION SCHEME PLACED INTO THEIR PENSIONS LIFEBOAT WHICH CAN SEE SOME MEMBERS OF THESE TEN PER CENT OF THEIR PAY OUT IMMEDIATELY AND SEE LOWER INCREMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS THE PROPOSAL AND THE UNION REACTION REFLECTS THE SENSE OF URGENCY ON ALL SIDES TO RESOLVE AN INDUSTRIAL CRISIS WHICH HE'S PUT TEN THOUSAND STEELWORKERS JOBS IN IMMINENT DANGER STEVE WEBB TOLD US THAT RUST CHANGES TO PENSIONS LEGISLATION COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR WORKERS WELL BEYOND THE STEEL INDUSTRY
THIS IS A COMPLEX AREA THE SISTEMA PROTECTING PENSIONS AS BUILT UP OVER MANY YEARS AND IF SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING WITH THE BEST INTENTION TO TRY AND TACKLE A SHORT TERM CRISIS THE DANGER IS THAT THIS DOESN'T JUST AFFECT ONE PENSION IT AFFECTS MANY AFFECTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND ONCE SHE BREAKS THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PENSION RIGHT YOU'VE BUILT UP IS YOURS IS SACROSANCT THAN THAT CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF WHAT WE DO AND COULD HAVE RIPPLE EFFECTS THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT
THE SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION IS LIKELY TO DOMINATE CAMPAIGNING IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE TODAY AS THE LATEST OFFICIAL FIGURES ON THEIR MIGRATION HAVE PUBLISHED THE FORMER HOME SECRETARY LORD BLUNKETT WHO BACKS THE REMAIN SIDE WILL SAY IT WOULD BE A CALAMITY OF AN AGREEMENT ALLOWING U.K. BORDER CONTROLS ON FRENCH SOIL WAS SCRAPPED
BUT THE FORMER SHADOW HOME SECRETARY DAVID DAVIS LEAVE CAMPAIGNER WILL CLAIM THAT E.U. MEMBERSHIP HAS SEEN BRITISH JOBS TRANSFERRED TO WORKERS FROM THE CONTINENT HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON
SENIOR FIGURES IN THE REMAIN CAMP BELIEVE THEY ARE WINNING THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT FOR CONTINUED E.U. MEMBERSHIP BUT TODAY A FORMER CONSERVATIVE EUROPE MINISTER REFUSED TO GIVE GROUND DAVID DAVIES WILL ACCUSE THOSE WHO WANT TO STAY IN THE E.U. OF BAKING A RELENTLESSLY PESSIMISTIC CASE AND WILL CLAIM AT THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A JOB'S TRANSFER MACHINE WHICH SWITCHES EMPLOYMENT IN THE U.K. FROM BRITISH WORKERS TO THOSE FROM THE CONTINENT
THE FORMER LABOUR HOME SECRETARY DAVID BLUNKETT FOOTED NOTE ADJOINING WHAT WAS THE E. C. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES BUT IN A SPEECH TODAY THE WORLD HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN UNTIL ATTEMPT TO FATE HIS OPPONENTS ON THEIR CHOSEN TERRITORY OF IMMIGRATION
YOU SUGGEST YOU MEMBERSHIP HELPED HIM NEGOTIATE THE CLOSURE OF THE SONG GUTS CAN'T CARRY MORE THAN A DECADE AGO AND ESTABLISH BRITISH BORDER CONTROLS ON FRENCH SOIL
THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK HAS APPEALED FOR GLOBAL SUPPORT TO HELP DEAL WITH THE MIGRANT CRISIS IN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST HE WAS SPEAKING IN JAPAN AT THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT OF INDUSTRIALISED NATIONS A DAY AFTER A DRAMATIC PHOTOGRAPHS EMERGED OF AN OVERCROWDED BOAT CAPSIZING OFF THE COAST OF LIBYA KILLING FIVE PEOPLE FROM THE SUMMIT IN A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE REPORTS
PRESENT TO US SAID GEOGRAPHY MEANT THAT EUROPE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE MOST RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEALING WITH THE MIGRATION CRISIS AND HE SAID THE NUMBERS COMING ACROSS FROM LIBYA TO ITALY IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WERE NOT ENCOURAGING
BUT HE SAID THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD TO RECOGNISE THAT THIS WAS ALSO A GLOBAL CRISIS SO HE URGED WORLD LEADERS AT THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT HERE IN JAPAN TO PROVIDE MORE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PARTICULARLY TO COUNTRIES HOSTING MOST REFUGEES HE SAID THAT TURKEY JORDAN AND LEBANON WHERE MILLIONS HAVE FLED FROM SYRIA WERE PROVIDING A GLOBAL PUBLIC GOOD AND THEY SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL COMMUNITY MY SAID HE DID NOT EXPECT ANY SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENTS LET'S JUST START HE SAID WITH SOME GOODWILL
THERE ARE CALLS FOR RADICAL ACTION TO DEAL WITH DELAYS IN DISCHARGING PATIENTS ONCE THEY'RE READY TO LEAVE HOSPITAL THE SPENDING WATCHDOG THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY OLDER PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL WHEN THEY DON'T NEED TO BE THERE AND THE COST TO THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND THIS MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S INCREASING FUNDING TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM
A REPORT BY U.S. SPENDING WATCHDOG HAS FOUND SOME OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT'S COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE SO OLD THAT THEY STILL USE FLOPPY DISKS THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE SAYS THE BUDGET TO MAINTAIN HER AGEING TECHNOLOGY IS THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF THE INVESTMENTS ON MODERN I.T. INFRASTRUCTURE FROM WASHINGTON GARY O'DONAHUE
YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT THE FLOPPY DISK WAS NOW AN HISTORICAL ARTEFACT BUT IT TURNS OUT IT'S ALIVE AND WELL WITHIN THE U.S. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT AND USED TO STORE DATA IN THE SYSTEM THAT COMMUNICATES WITH THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF AMERICA'S NUCLEAR DETERRENT
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES TECHNOLOGY IS SO LIMITED THAT YOU NEED ABOUT THREE MILLION OF THEM TO APPROACH THE STORAGE CAPACITY OF A TEN DOLLAR U.S.B. MEMORY STICK
BUT THE PENTAGON ISN'T ALONE U. S. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEMS ARE WRITTEN IN A COMPUTER LANGUAGE DATING FROM THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHICH FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH ON THE FLOPPY DISCS THE PENTAGON SAYS THEY'LL BE GONE BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR THOUGH THE FORTY YEAR OLD COMPUTERS THAT USE THEM MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO REACH THE MUSEUM
PROBATION OFFICERS SAY THEY'RE BEING TOLD NOT TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST OFFENDERS WHO FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF HER SENTENCE BECAUSE THE PROBATION COMPANIES THEY WORK FOR RISK BEING FINED THE CLAIM EMERGED IN A REPORT BY THE INSPECTORATE OF PROBATION ON THE NEW SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES AND THE WHICH LOW OR MEDIUM RISK OFFENDERS ARE SUPERVISED BY STAFF WORKING FOR TWENTY ONE COMMUNITY REHABILITATION COMPANIES HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
AS PART OF THE NEW PROBATION SYSTEM PAYMENTS FOR COMMUNITY REHABILITATION COMPANIES ARE LINKED TO OFFENDERS COMPLYING WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR SENTENCE AND NOT COMMITTING FURTHER CRIMES EVIDENCE UNCOVERED BY INSPECTORS HOWEVER SUGGEST THAT MAY DETER PROBATION STAFF FROM TAKING ACTION AGAINST OFFENDERS WHO BREACHED COMMUNITY ORDERS
A NUMBER OF PROBATION OFFICERS SAID THEY HAD BEEN TOLD NOT TO RECOMMEND TO THE COURTS THAT AN OFFENDER'S COMMUNITY SENTENCE BE REVOKED IN SUCH CASES BECAUSE THEIR COMPANY WOULD INCUR A FINANCIAL PENALTY ONE OFFICER SAID THEIR ORGANISATION'S APPROACH WAS TO DISCOURAGE ENFORCING COMMUNITY ORDERS OR THE CONDITIONS OF A PRISONER RELEASED ON LICENCE THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE SAID IT WAS WORKING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT
A GROUP OF INDEPENDENT TRANSPORT EXPERTS HAS PUBLISHED A REPORT CRITICISING THE PROPOSED NEW HIGH SPEED RAIL LINK H. S. TWO SAYING ITS BENEFITS COULD BE ACHIEVED MUCH MORE CHEAPLY AND WITH LOWER C.O.TWO EMISSIONS ONE OF THE AUTHORS PROFESSOR TONY MADE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS TOLD US IT WAS TIME TO ASK WHAT TAXPAYERS WERE GETTING FOR THEIR FIFTY SIX BILLION POUNDS
WHAT THE SCHEME WAS DESIGNED TO DO WAS ADD CAPACITY OUT OF LONDON IMPROVE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CITIES REGENERATE THE NORTH AND CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS AND THE ONLY ONE OF THOSE THAT IT CLEARLY SHE WAS HIS INCREASING CAPACITY
BUT CHARLES THOMAS THE TECHNICAL DIRECTOR OF H. S. TWO INSISTED ITS BENEFITS WOULD BE WIDE RANGING WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHICH WILL ALLOW SO MUCH MORE CAPACITY TO BE PROVIDED THAT THE CONVENTIONAL NETWORK WILL BE FREED UP AND CHOICES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT CITIES AND IN A FAR MORE EFFICIENT WAY
THE B.B.C. HAS LEARNED THAT THE AMOUNT SPENT BY THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND ON PRIVATE AMBULANCES FOR NINE NINE NINE CALLS IS THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN FOUR YEARS AGO THAT RISE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF EMERGENCY CALLS DAVISON REPORTS
FOLLOWING A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST THE ELEVEN AMBULANCE TRUSTS ACROSS ENGLAND TOLD THE B. B. C. THEY SPENT MORE THAN SIXTY EIGHT MILLION POUNDS ON PRIVATE PROVIDERS RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY CALLS IN THE PAST YEAR THE HIGHEST SPENDER WAS SOUTH CENTRAL AT THIRTEEN MILLION POUNDS FOLLOWED BY NEARLY TWELVE MILLION IN LONDON AND TEN MILLION IN THE SOUTH EAST TRUST SAID ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS BEHIND THE INCREASE WAS A SHARP RISING CALLS FOUR AND A HALF PER CENT IN A YEAR THE UNISON UNIONIST DESCRIBED THE FIGURES AS CREEPING PRIVATISATION OF THE N.H.S.
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAYS TRUSTS OCCASIONALLY USE OTHER PROVIDERS TO HELP WITH SPIKES AND DEMAND AND THESE PROVIDERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RIGOUROUS INSPECTIONS AS N.H.S. AMBULANCES
THE ROYAL NAVY IS LOOKING INTO CLAIMS THAT THE WRECK OF A BRITISH SUBMARINE LOST DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR HAS BEEN FOUND OFF SARDINIA THE VESSEL AND ITS CREW OF SEVENTY ONE VANISHED AFTER LEAVING MALTA IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO TO TAKE PART IN AN ALLIED ATTACK ON ITALIAN WARSHIPS AND ITALIAN DIVERS HAS HE RECOGNISED IT FROM TWO MAN TORPEDOES STRAPPED TO THE HULL THE TIME IS NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT
THE SOUND RECORDED ON AN ITALIAN NAVAL VESSEL IN THE MEDITERRANEAN THE PICTURES THAT GO WITH IT A GRIM AND SHOW EVERYTHING THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION HOPED IT HAD STOPPED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE CROWDED ONTO A FISHING BOAT AS IT'S APPROACHED BY THE ITALIAN PATROL SHIP IT CAPSIZES PEOPLE ARE THROWN INTO THE WATER MORE FALL FROM THE DECK ON TOP OF THEM ITALIAN NAVY THROUGH ANY INFLATABLES THEY CAN INTO THE SEA TO TRY TO RESCUE THEM
FRANCESCA YOU THAT'S IS COMMANDER OF THE BETTY CA PATROL BOAT AND OVERSAW THE RESCUE I SPOKE TO HIM A SHORT WHILE AGO VIA A SATELLITE PHONE AS HE HEADED BACK TO LAND WITH THE HUNDREDS THAT HE AND HIS CREW HAD PICKED OUT OF THE SEA HE TOLD ME ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED FROM THE FRIDGE
WHAT'S CLEAR FROM THE IMAGES IS THAT AS PEOPLE ARE FALLING INTO THE WATER OTHERS ARE SLIDING ACROSS THE DECK AND LANDING ON TOP OF THEM DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE DROWNED IN THE RESCUE
BECAUSE OF COURSE ANYBODY WHO WAS STILL IN THE HULL OR DOWN BELOW IN INSIDE THE SHIP WOULD HAVE BEEN LUCKY TO SURVIVE
WE DON'T KNOW HOW ARE THEY THOSE THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN ON BOARD YOUR SHIP HARDLY OLA I AM FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW WOULD BE OLA WINE THERE ARE NO CRITICAL ENGLISH HERE NOW IT IS YOUR JOB TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS SAVE SEA OPERATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN HAVE YOUSE EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE I MUST SAY MAUREEN I KNOW WHAT I'M MAXED OUT IN IT'S A SITUATION OF MEGAN IT WOULD WHAT EFFECT DOES IT HAVE ON YOU AND THE CREW

THAT WAS COMMANDER FRANCESCO YOU'VE HAD SO TALKING TO ME A LITTLE EARLIER WILL AS DRAMATIC AS THAT RESCUE WAS THOSE FIVE HUNDRED OR SO THAT HE'S PICKED UP ONLY A FRACTION OF THEIR FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED MIGRANTS THAT ITALY'S COASTGUARD SAY THEY PICKED UP SINCE THE START OF THE WEEK PETER SUTHERLAND IS THE U.N. SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION MIGRATION AND HE'S IN A RADIO CAR GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING DO YOU THINK THAT IMPART WE'RE SEEING THIS MASSIVE INCREASE IN NUMBERS FROM LIBYA BECAUSE OF THE DEAL BETWEEN TURKEY IN THE E.U.
THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE CASE AND RELATIVELY FEW ALTHOUGH THE CAPTAIN REFERRED TO SYRIAN REFUGEES BEING PART OF TOES TO WERE BEING SAVED RELATIVELY FEW SEEM TO BE COMING ACROSS AS LESS THAN ONE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED ACROSS NORTH AFRICA TO USE AS THEY JUMP OFF SPOT FOR TRAVEL ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN MOST SEEM TO BE COMING FROM SUB SAHARAN AFRICA
LAST WEEK I WAS IN A CAMP IN SICILY AND OH SO THAT'S EVERY BELL DOING VIRTUALLY IN THE CAMP WAS DEFINITELY FROM SUB SAHARAN AFRICA BUT THE NUMBERS SO STARTING SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR FORTY TWO COWS AND MIGRANTS HAVE ARRIVED IN THEIR NATION AND IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND
AND THIS GENERALLY STARTS TO INCREASE AS THE GOOD WEATHER OF THE SUMMER APPROACHES AND THAT'S WELL FIRST SEEING SO WHAT DO YOU THINK NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT BUT THE COMPLEXITY OF ANSWERING THAT QUESTION HAVE IS CONSIDERABLE BECAUSE WHILST WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A MASS OF FLOW OF PEOPLE DRIVEN BY DIFFERENT CALLS
MOST OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT MATTER OF TRIPS FROM TURKEY TO GREECE HAVE BEEN REFUGEES WHO WERE ESCAPING PERSECUTION MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE COMING FROM LIBYA PROBABLY I'M NOT REFUGEES THEY'RE PROBABLY ECONOMIC MIGRANTS PEOPLE WHO WERE ESCAPING FROM POVERTY
BUT SOME ARE ALSO ESCAPING FROM A DROUGHT FOR AN EXAMPLE IN SOMALIA MANY COME ACROSS FROM SOMALIA BUT YVETTE WHAT CAN BE DONE IN A PUB PART OF THE DIFFICULTY HERE IS THAT WHY THERE'S AN AGREEMENT IS SALTWOOD TURKEY BY THE E.U. YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE GOVERNMENT WE'RE TO RICHARD TO END SAID TRUE AND WORKING EFFECTIVELY OBVIOUSLY IN TURKEY
IN LIBYA THERE IS NO OF PARITY WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE CAN DO YOU AS EFFECTIVELY
IN BRINGING ABOUT THE REDUCTION OF IRREGULAR MIGRATION AND CONVERTING ED'S I WOULD HOPE TO HAVE SOME MORE REGULAR OR ILLEGAL MIGRATION SO WHAT DO THEY DO THAT AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE THE CAPTAIN OF THAT SHIP ABOUT TO ARRIVE IN ITALY WITH ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MIGRANTS SHOULD THEY SHOULD THEY MOST OF THEM JUST TO BE RETURNED TO A NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRY
EACH AS A NUN TYPE A MONK TO BE EVALUATED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE REFUGEES IF THEY'RE A REFUGEE USED THEN THEY CAN LAUGH AND SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED IF THEY ARE NOT REFUGEES NAMELY PEOPLE WHO WERE ESCAPING PERSECUTION AND THEY ARE OPEN TO BEING RETURNED
BUT IT DEPENDS REALLY ON THE INDIVIDUAL WHERE'D THEY COME FROM AND WHO WILL ACCEPT THEM BACK AND IT'S AN EXTREMELY COMPLICATED THE OPERATION THE RESULT OF THIS IS THAT PEOPLE ARE IN CAMPS FOR PROLONGED PERIODS OF TIME
THE FIRST PRIORITY OF COURSE HAS TO BE WHAT THE ITALIAN AND OTHER NAVIES ARE DOING BUT I WANT TO PAY PARTICULAR TRIBUTE TO THE ITALIAN MAYBE SAVE LIVES ONCE THEIR LIVES ARE SAVED THEN DID INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO BE PROCESSED IN A HUMANE AND DIGNIFIED WAY AND YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THEY ARE REFUGEES ARE NOT IF THERE ARE ENOUGH REFUGEES AS I SAY THEY DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT
TO ASYLUM AND AS FAR AS THE HERE WE ARE THE BURDEN ON ITALY CLEARLY HUGE WHAT SHOULD OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES BE DOING
I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A WHOLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FINANCIAL AND IN SHARING THE MIGRANTS
ON THE BASIS OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE TWO COUNTRIES AND THE FRONTLINE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION GREECE AND TURKEY OR GREECE AGREE SEND INSTANTLY SO THEREFORE EVERYBODY CANNOT STAND BACK AND SIMPLY SAY EDULIS RECEIVED THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND MIGRANTS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT'S IT AT THESE PROBLEM IS THIS
IT'S A EUROPEAN PROBLEM AND IT'S A GLOBAL PROBLEM BUT THERE'S HOPE FOR YOU COULD'VE BEEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN URGING ITS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT SINCE THIS CRISIS STARTED AND LITTLE OR AT LEAST NOT AS MUCH ON THE SCALE THAT IS REQUIRED HAS CHANGED WHAT
COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE TO MAKE OTHER COUNTRIES SHARE ITALY AND GREECE HIS BURDEN
I THINK THAT CONSTANT EXPLANATION OF AUTOS HAPPENING AND THE DREADFUL CONDITIONS BUT THIS GIVES RISE TO IS THE ALDERLEY
BY A POLITICAL ANSWER TO THIS I THINK DEBS COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD NOT JUST IN EUROPE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SHARE AND THIS SOME COUNTRIES ARE STEPPING UP TO THE MARK IN CANADA FOR AN EXAMPLE THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE
HOPEFULLY LATER IN THE YEAR WE HAVE A CONFERENCE IN SEPTEMBER AND THE RELATED NATIONS MORE WILL STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND THE UNITED STATES I THINK AS A RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IT SEEMS TO BE ABOUT TO TAKE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP ALSO AND US
JUST ONE BRIEF THOUGHT THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD POINT TO THE DEAL BETWEEN THE E.U. AND TURKEY AND SAY THE FACT THAT THOUGH IS THERE IS IT'S ACCEPTED THEY WILL BE IMMEDIATELY SENT BACK TO TURKEY HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE SOME WOULD SAY YOU SEND THESE PEOPLE BACK IMMEDIATELY AND THAT WILL STOP THE FLOW
THE TURKEY AGREEMENT HAS CERTAINLY HAD AN ENORMOUS EFFECT BUT THE ARRANGEMENT HAS LOVE BEEN PROPERLY CONCLUDED EVERYBODY HAS TO BE SATISFIED THAT THOSE WHO WERE SENT BACK ARE GOING TO BE PROPERLY TRIGGS IT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS UNDERTAKEN TO DO VARIOUS THINGS AND IT'S ARRANGEMENTS WITH TURKEY NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN PROPERLY CONCLUDE MY FEAR IS THAT LIVED THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT CONTINUED
THEN WE COULD HAVE A RECURRENCE OF THE LARGE FLOWS FROM TURKEY TOUR TO GREECE PETER SUCH THAT SOLD DAD'S IN LEGAL WAY ABOVE AGREEMENT CAN BE BROUGHT TO A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION PETER SUTHERLAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT ANYONE WHO THOUGHT THE DONALD TRUMP WAS UNELECTABLE FORGOT TO TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT HIS LIKELY OPPONENTS IN THIS NOVEMBER'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION NOT ONLY HAS HILLARY CLINTON GOT NEGATIVE RATINGS ALMOST AS HIGH AS MISTER TRUMP'S NOT ONLY IS SHE FACING DAMAGING ENQUIRIES INTO HER USE OF A PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE
SHE IS ALSO STILL STRUGGLING TO SEE OFF THE CAMPAIGN OF BERNIE SAUNDERS HE'S FIGHTING TO THE END AND MAY YET PRODUCE WHAT HE HIMSELF CALLS A MESSY DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN JULY JIM JIM KNOCKED REPORTS NOW FROM CALIFORNIA
BERNIE'S ARMY ON THE MARCH
THEY'RE FEELING THE BURN IN THIS PARK IN SAN DIEGO STUDENTS SOME BEARDED SURVIVORS OF THE SIXTIES WEARING THE OLD CLOTHES
THERE'S A STALL SELLING SOCIALIST PAMPHLET EVEN A LARGE MAN IN A KILT IT'S NO SURPRISE WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THE MARCH HAS BEEN BLESSED BY SOME AZTEC DANCERS
IT'S ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOME JUST TO BEAT CLINTON IN THE DELEGATE CANTON THE REMAINING PRIMARIES HE'S BEHIND BY MORE THAN SHE WAS WHEN SHE GAVE UP AGAINST BARACK OBAMA IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUT HE LOVES THE CROWD AND HE WANTS
TO BE CERTAIN THAT DONALD SHRUB IS THE FEEDED AND THAT WE MIGHT
I'VE GOT A CAMPAIGN TO DO THERE
IT'S MYSTIFYING TO OLD POLITICAL PROFESSIONALS ERIC BOWMAN IS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN A CLINTON SUPPORTER AND HE'S IRRITATED BY TALK OF HER NEGATIVE RATINGS WITH SOME VOTERS
BERNIE SANDERS NEGATIVE RATING IS FIFTEEN POINT HIGHER THEM A NEGATIVE RATING SO LET'S START WITH THAT REALITY O.K. HERE'S AVERAGE NEGATIVE RAIDING A SEVENTY THREE PERCENT IT'S AS HIGH AS ANY NOMINEE
AND HE'S GOT NO DOUBT ABOUT THE BEST PERSON TO STOP THEM
TAMARA WERE HARD WORKERS IRON FAMILIES ARE SUPPORTED STREETS ARE SAFE AND COMMUNITIES ARE STRONG AND WEAR A MUD TRANCE HEY
THIS IS AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN WITH A RESIN ME THE TRICK BANG SHE'S A BRILLIANT LAWYER
SHE WAS A UNITED STATES SENATOR SHE WAS A FIRST LADY SHE WAS A SECRETARY OF STATE SHE'S DONE MORGAN HELP CHILDREN CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE EDUCATION
TRUG CAN ONLY TALK IN METAPHOR ISM IN LARGE BANNERS WHEN YOU LISTEN TO HER TALK STANDING NEXT TO HIM
YOU SEE SUBSTANCE AND ABSTINENCE
BUT IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT SOME SANDERS FANS SAY THEY WILL NEVER SUPPORT HER TRY BYE
IF HE DOESN'T MAKE IT WOULD YOU
WHY NOT IF IT'S AGAINST TRUMP DOWN THEIR TRACK WINS ANYWAY SHE'S NOT WE WANT TO FOR
MAKE IT YES I DO BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THAT YOU JUST GAVE IN ITS BE O.K. WHAT DO YOU DO HAVE HILARY WINS A NOMINATION WHAT DO YOU DO IN NOVEMBER
AND GONNA LIGHT BERNIE'S NAME IN THERE WEDGE ALLEGEDLY I WAS GOING TO
I CAN'T ME BOY ROW IF SHE WEREN'T BUT NOW I WON'T EVEN VOTE FOR AFTER ALL OF THE DIRTY TRICKS THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYED
ON THE MARCH THEY SPEAK OF A MOVEMENT SOMETHING DEEPER THAN THE POLITICS OF THE MOMENT AND THE SOUND AS CAMPAIGN HAS MOBILISED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS AND SO CALLED MILLENNIAL THE UNDER THIRTIES
AND TOUCHED A NERVE WITH THOSE WITH NEVER COME UNDER THE CLINTON SPELL LIKE THE DEMOCRAT MAY BURROW WHEN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS IN CHALLENGE TWO
TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THEMSELVES THERE WAS BIG FINERY IS HERS THAT SECRETARY CLEM HAS BEEN HAMMERING
IS A REMNANT OF AN OLIGARCHY
LIKE MANY AMERICANS I WORK TO DISMANTLE
LIKE MANY AMERICANS WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF NOT HAVING A VOICE IN OUR OWN GOVERNOR
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LET'S BUST STRUGGLING
THAT'S THE SENTIMENT THAT REPUBLICANS HOPED TO EXPLOIT IN THE COMING CAMPAIGN IT'S IRRITATING TO DEMOCRATS LIKE STEPHANIE MILLER JUST BACK FROM BEING A START TIME OF THAT HILARY FUNDRAISER SHE BROADCASTS A SYNDICATED RADIO SHOW FROM HER HOME IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS AND SHE'S A STAND UP COMEDIAN
IT IS THE STEPPING OR SHOW UP DO IT SIX MINUTES AFTER THE HOUR THREE TWO TO ME I UNDERSTAND THE PASSION AND ALL THAT THAT'S BEHIND IT IT JUST DOESN'T IT'S A WAR AGAINST MOUTH AT THIS POINT VERY CENTRES HASN'T HAD ONE NEGATIVE AD RUN AGAINST HIM THERE'S A REASON WHY KARL
SUPER PAK WAS RUNNING ADS AGAINST HILLARY THEY WANT TO RUN AGAINST BARNEY THEY WERE IN THERE CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO TO A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD SOCIALIST JEWEL FROM FROM MINE WHEN YOU SEE WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO HILARY I MEAN THEY DON'T NOTHIN LEFT THE THRONE HILARY IS SO I THINK THAT
BUT YOU KNOW SHE CERTAINLY IS TESTED IN THAT WAY ME AND SHE JUST GETS UP AND PUT ON A NEW PARENTS WHO SOON IT WAS BACK OUT THERE AGAIN AND I THINK PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED BUT IT WE'RE GOING TO TRUMP AS A FIRE
YOU SUCK WORDS ADIDAS SANDERS OR ARE YOU SUPPORT ME THERE'S MUCH MORE THAT UNITES US THEN DIVIDES
BUT IS THAT ENOUGH TO UNITE THEM ERIC BOWMAN THINKS HE KNOWS WHERE THE ELECTION WILL BE ONE MORE O'NEILL'S MAY DECIDE THE SELECTION
THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE LARGEST AGED VOTING AGE GROUP ALWAYS A THRIFTY FIVE AND OLDER WHICH BY THE WAY AS A CONSTITUENCY THAT STRONGLY SUPPORTS OR EQUIPMENT ON THE ISSUES THE THINGS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CARE ABOUT
COTTON CHERISH THOSE WITH EVE IF EVEN IF SHE DOESN'T GO AS FAR AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO PERHAPS
BUT THEY COULD DO WITH A UNITED PARTY AFTER THE CONVENTION AND THE SANDERS CAMPAIGN IS SO STRONG SO PASSIONATE THAT SOME OF THEM ARE STARTING TO WORRY THAT IT COULD BE DIFFICULT MAYBE THEY NEED A DOSE OF OPINION POLLS PUTTING TRUMPER HEAD IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET BUT IT MIGHT
BIRDIED PAD WE'RE HERE TO SEE YOU NOT THAT IT WOULD PUT OFF THESE SOLDIERS AND BURMESE CAUSE MOCO TILTED FRIEND WITH A BIG VOICE
ON THEIR WAY TO THE CONVENTION AND IN THEIR WAY AS REMARKABLE AS DONALD TRUMP'S BONE ARMY
NINETY NINE PRESERVE OUR GOODS
THAT WAS A GUILTY FRIEND JIM KNOCKED YOU'VE GOT TWENTY NINE AND HIS PROSTATE IN HERE IS ROBERT ROB BONNET IN A PAIR OF TROUSERS WITH THIS ALWAYS IN A PAIR OF TROUSERS JUST THANKS NICK GOOD MORNING TO YOU IN A WEEK OF A MAJOR MANAGERIAL COMING AND GOING IN FOOTBALL THIS MORNING THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO'S STAYING RATHER URBAN AGES COULD HAVE ACTIVATED A RE LEASE CALLS IN HIS CONTRACT AFTER NEWCASTLE UNITED'S RELEGATION FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE BUT HE'S CHOSEN TO STAY TALKING OF THE PASSION OF THE FANS AND OF HOW THE CLUB HAS A GREAT FUTURE HE HAS A THREE YEAR DEAL

THE LAST COURSE CHANGES WERE COMPLETED IN TWENTY TEN THEY DIDN'T DO THE JOB THE NATURE OF A FAMOUS OLD COURSE WAS WAS RADICALLY ALTERED NOT TO THE PLAYERS LIKING BUT ALSO THE NATIVE GRASSES VERY QUICKLY GOT INTO THE RELAYED GREENS AND THE PROBLEM AT THIS TIME OF YEAR IS THAT THE GRASSES GROW AT DIFFERENT RATES AND SO BY MID AFTERNOON UNDERNEATH THE SUNSHINE THEY'VE BEEN WATERED A LITTLE BIT AS WELL
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE GRASS STARTS GROWING AT DIFFERENT RATES THE PUTTING SURFACE HAS BECOME BUMPY AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EIGHTEEN NEW GREENS FOR NEXT YEAR AND WENT WITH THE PROMISING HUGE IMPROVEMENTS FOR FUTURE EVENTS OH ME MEANWHILE THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS WILL HAVE RYDER CUP SELECTION ON THEIR MINDS WHEN THEY YES THEY WILL AND I THINK A PLAYER TO WATCH THIS WEEK IS SCOTLAND'S RUSSELL KNOX WHO IS BASED IN THE UNITED STATES HE HAS BEEN FOR HIS ENTIRE CAREER BUT THAT THE END OF LAST YEAR HE WON A BIG TOURNAMENT IN CHINA THAT PUT HIM ON THE RED RYDER CUP
RADAR HE REALISED THAT IT WAS AN ATTAINABLE GOAL AND SO HE JOINED THE EUROPEAN TOUR THAT'S WHY HE'S MISSING ONE OF HIS FAVOURITE EVENTS IN AMERICA THIS WEEK TO PLAY HERE HE IS DETERMINED TO MAKE EUROPE'S RYDER CUP TEAM AND OTHERS WHO WILL BE KEEN TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION INCLUDE LEE WESTWOOD AND LUKE DONALD THIS WEEK IN COLOUR THANK YOU WE'LL LOOK OUT FOR RUSSELL KNOCKS BUT ME MUM WE MUST MAKE DO WITH A RACING TIP BANGOR ON DEE THREE TEN NUMBER ONE DREAMS OR THEATRE PAID UP FOUR O'CLOCK NUMBER FOUR MOLTEN GOLD

BEATS THE RHETORIC WEARING THE REFEREE THE BAY DOESN'T IT IT DOES A QUICK LOOK AT THE WEATHER WARMER IN THE SELF CLOUDIER AND COOLER FURTHER NORTH YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE SOME OF THE NEWS FROM CHRIS ALDRIDGE THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING RADICAL CHANGES TO THE BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME RUN BY TATA WHICH WOULD SEE BENEFITS PEG TO A LEVEL OF INFLATION WHICH IS GENERALLY LOWER IT'S HOPING THE MOVE WILL HELP THE SALE OF TATA'S U.K. OPERATIONS
THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT DONALD TUSK IS APPEALING FOR GLOBAL SUPPORT TO HELP DEAL WITH THE MIGRANT CRISIS HE WAS SPEAKING IN JAPAN AT THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT TODAY AFTER DRAMATIC PICTURES EMERGED OF AN OVERCROWDED BOAT CAPSIZING OFF THE COAST OF LIBYA THE U.N. SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR MIGRATION PETER SUTHERLAND TOLD US THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD A DUTY TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES ON THE FRONT LINE OF THE PROBLEM GREECE AND ITALY
THE SPENDING WATCHDOG IS CALLING FOR RADICAL ACTION OVER DELAYS AND DISCHARGING PATIENTS WHO ARE READY TO LEAVE HOSPITAL THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS KEEPING PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL UNNECESSARILY COSTS THE N.H.S. ENGLAND EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR
A U.S. GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG HAS WARNED THAT AMERICA'S NUCLEAR ARSENAL IS RELIANT ON OUTDATED COMPUTERS THAT URGENTLY NEED TO BE UPGRADED IT SAID SOME PENTAGON SYSTEMS USED FLOPPY DISKS
THANK YOU CHRIS IT'S TWENTY FIVE TO NINE WE'RE NOT IN CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS THAT'S THE CENTRAL CLAIM OF COURSE ARE MANY WHO BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO REGAIN THAT CONTROL IS TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAVE YOU SURE TO BE BOOSTED WHEN THE LATEST IMMIGRATION STATISTICS ARE PUBLISHED LATER TODAY THEY'RE SET TO SHOW THE GOVERNMENT IS NOWHERE NEAR MEETING ITS TARGET OF GETTING NET MIGRATION DOWN TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS
TODAY THE MAN WHO WAS HOME SECRETARY WHEN THE DECISION WAS TAKEN TO ALLOW POLES AND OTHER EAST EUROPEANS TO COME HERE IN RECORD NUMBERS WILL CLAIM THAT WE DO HOWEVER STILL CONTROL OUR BORDERS THAT MAN IS OF COURSE DAVID NOW LORD BUNKER DE JOINT IS ON THE LINE MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HOW DO YOU CLAIM THAT WE'RE STILL IN CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS BECAUSE SURELY
THE RESULT OF OUR E.U. MEMBERSHIP IS WE CANNOT ADMINISTERS CANNOT DETERMINE HOW MANY COME HERE WE CAN'T SAY WHO COMES HERE AND THEY CAN'T SAY FROM WHERE OH YES AND THEY CAN'T CHECK WHO IS COMING AND WHETHER THEY ARE AUTHORISED TO DO SO WE CAN CHECK WHETHER THEY ARE PREPARED TO WORK AND IF THEY'RE NOT WE HAVE POWERS ALREADY AND WE SHOULD BE USING THEM UNDER THE HABITUAL RESIDENCE TEST TO BE ABLE TO RETURN PEOPLE
BACK HOME THE PARTISANS DOESN'T IT DAVID BLUNKETT THE ODD SERIOUS CRIMINAL THE ODD PERSON WHO DOESN'T WELL TWICE THE WORK THEY TO MARCH TWELVE THOUSAND OF THOSE KIND OF RETURNEES OVER THE LAST DECADE BUT MANY PEOPLE DISCOURAGED FROM COMING ACROSS THE CHANNEL
BY THE INTERVENTION OF OUR SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION STAFF ON FRENCH SOIL AND IF YOU'D JUST FORGIVE ME FOR A MINUTE BY CORRECTING YOU THAT WE DIDN'T JUST SIMPLY SAY TO POLES ALL THOSE COMING IN ON THE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOR JUST COME HERE WE SAID IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME HERE WE'D RATHER YOU WORK
LEGALLY LEGITIMATELY THAN WE WOULD YOU BE IN THE SUB ECONOMY FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE WHO REGISTERED TO WORK IN TWO THOUSAND FOR FOUR PER CENT WERE ALREADY IN THE COUNTRY AND THE REASON I MAKE THAT POINT IS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD COME IN ILLEGALLY IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BORDER CONTROLS ON FRENCH SOIL THE REASON THIS IS SO IMPORTANT NICK AND IT'S IT'S A VITAL PART OF ARGUING WITH
THOSE WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE FEARS ABOUT MASS MIGRATION THEY WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE WORLD WHO LIVE IN COMMUNITIES WHICH I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH GLOBALISATION OFTEN AFFECTED BADLY BY IT IS THAT WITHOUT THOSE CONTROLS ON FRENCH SOIL OUR BORDER WOULD BE MOVED BACK TO KENT IN OTHER WORDS WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE BORDER CONTROLS
IN FRANCE WHICH PUT ALLOW US TO WEED OUT TO PREVENT PEOPLE WHO WILL KNOW RIGHT TO COME TO THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM DOING SO THEY HAD REACHED THE SOIL OF BRITAIN THEY'D CLAIM ASYLUM OR THEY DISAPPEAR INTO THE SUB ECONOMY OR WORK ILLEGAL O.K. I THINK WHAT A FASCINATING THEME OF WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID OF THE SPEECH YOU'RE GIVING WHICH I'VE WRITTEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT INEVITABILITY THAT'S A PHRASE YOU USE IN YOUR SPEECH I DO BECAUSE IT'S INEVITABLE IMAGES DOES QUESTION
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MANY PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WELL NO FOR BRITAIN IT IS NOT INEVITABLE THAT PEOPLE COME HERE BECAUSE WE ARE AN ISLAND IT IS MUCH EASIER FOR BRITAIN TO A WRECK BORDERS TO MAINTAIN BORDERS TO HAVE BARRIERS TO PEOPLE COMING PRECISELY BECAUSE OF OUR GEOGRAPHY AND THAT IF YOU DON'T MIND IS WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO
WELL MY ARGUMENT IS ALL ABOUT THE FACT THAT GLOBALISATION IS UNAVOIDABLE AND WE EITHER FACE IT AND WE WORK TOGETHER OR WE WILL BE SWEPT ASIDE BY BY THE POWERFUL INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES FROM FINANCE THROUGH TO GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK AND AMAZON AND THE BIG MINING COMPANIES OR BY NATION STATES WITH POPULATIONS OF OVER A BILLION
CHINA INDIA DOING DEALS WITH THESE COMPANY WITH THESE COMPANIES BECAUSE OF THE MARKET THAT THEY PROVIDE SO IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THOSE CONSTITUENTS YOU USED TO HAVE TOLD YOU HOW CONCERNED THEY WERE ABOUT IMMIGRATION
TOUGH I'M REALLY SORRY WE CANNOT DO IT I KNOW COS IT WASN'T TURNED AND IT ISN'T AND I LIVED WITH THEM AND I WENT TO SEE THEM AND I SHARED A LOT OF THEIR FEARS AND PAIN MIGHT MY MESSAGES THAT INTELLIGENTLY RATIONALLY WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AS WE DO FROM THE THE PLAYGROUND OF THE SCHOOL BULLY ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE CREATION OF THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT
IF YOU'RE ISOLATED AND YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL YOUR POWER INFLUENCE YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE CHANGE IS DIMINISHED AND IF YOU JOINED TOGETHER YOU CAN DO SOMETHING AND WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH THE AGREEMENT WITH TURKEY THAT WAS MENTIONED A FEW MINUTES AGO WHICH HAS STEMMED THE TIDE THROUGH GREECE MACEDONIA BUT WHO DID EXAMPLE FORGIVE ME THAT AGREEMENTS OR I JUST WANT TO PICK THAT UP OF PRECISELY THE PROBLEM WHICH IN RETURN FOR THAT DEAL TO STOP PEOPLE CROSSING THE WATERS TO GREECE
TURKEY SAYS WE MUST OUR VISA FREE TRAVEL WE WANT TO SPEED UP OUR MEMBERSHIP JENNY OR IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH AN ILLEGAL FLOW OF MIGRANTS TURKEY SAYING WE NOW ON A MASSIVE INCREASE IN THE LEGAL FLAT THEY ARE SAYING THAT BUT WE'RE NOT PART OF SHOWING THEM WE WE HAVE AN OPT OUT IN TERMS OF THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT SO WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND I HOPE
NEXT FOUR WEEKS WE'VE GOT FOUR WEEKS TODAY TO GO WE'LL TRY AND HAVE A REASONABLE INTELLIGENT DEBATE WHERE THIS IS NOT ABOUT PERSONALITIES OR WHO'S GOING TO BE PRIME MINISTER OR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE CONSERVATIVE PART OF THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF BRITAIN AND WHETHER WE CAN USE COLLECTIVE STRENGTH TO TACKLE GLOBAL
PROBLEMS OF THESE UP WHETHER IT'S SECURITY WHETHER IT'S MASS PEOPLE MOVEMENTS NINETEEN MILLION PEOPLE DISPLACED OUT OF THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN ACROSS THE WORLD CAN WE PULL TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER AND CAN WE HAVE A BIT OF RESPECT FOR THOSE IN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE
OUR ANTAGONISM TO BUREAUCRACY WHO ARE EQUALLY WORRIED ABOUT UNFETTERED PEOPLE MOVEMENT THEY ROCKET WHO HAVE ALL THE SAME INSTINCTS THAT WE HAVE LET'S WORK WITH THEM VERY BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD ARE YOU WORRIED THAT LABOUR VOTERS SIMPLY DON'T SEE THIS AS THEIR FIGHT YES OF COURSE I AM I'M WORRIED THAT THEY DON'T SEE IT AS THEIR FIGHT I I'M WORRIED THAT THEY THINK THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO
I GONE ERA AND I THINK THOSE OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO BE ON A PUBLIC PLATFORM HAVE DONE A LOT OF TRAVELLING WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS I WAS TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF PUTTING OUR SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION ON TO FRENCH SO WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO START TALKING LANGUAGE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND BUT TO REASSURE THEM THAT WE HAVEN'T LOST OUR MARBLES EITHER DAVID BLUNKETT LAW BUNKER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE HAVE EVER BEEN TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN BUT A CHINESE COMPANY HAS PLANS TO DOMINATE THE DEEP THEY'RE BUILDING A SUBMARINE THAT WILL TAKE HUMANS TO THE DEEPEST PLACE IN THE OCEAN THE MARIANA TRENCH WHICH LIES NEARLY SEVEN MILES DOWN BUT AS TENSIONS GROW IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE MARINE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED AS A GLOBAL SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT REBECCA MOREL NOW REPORTS
I'VE COME TO A SHIPYARD A FEW HOURS SOUTH OF SHANGHAI AND A HUGE CEREMONY IS UNDERWAY THERE ARE BALLOONS FLYING THERE'S MUSIC PLAYING DRAGONS DANCING
THIS IS ALL FOR THE MAIDEN VOYAGE OF A GIANT RESEARCH SHIP WHICH IS ABOUT TO GO TO THE WATER FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
WITH ITS TETHERS CUT THE ONE HUNDRED METRE LONG VESSEL ROLLS INTO THE SEA
BUILT IN A YEAR WITH ITS ONBOARD LABS EQUIPPED WITH THE LATEST SCIENTIFIC KIT IT WILL EVENTUALLY EXPLORE THE WORLD'S OCEANS
BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO HELP CHINA PLUNGED BENEATH THE WAVES IT'S BEEN DESIGNED AS A LAUNCH PAD FOR SUBMARINES THAT CAN GO ANYWHERE NO MATTER HOW DEEP
SHAPE IS A VERY STREAMLINED THAT'S RIGHT COS HE WANTED TO TRAVEL QUICKLY HELP HELP HOW LONG TO GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA YEAH LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS AT SHANGHAI OCEAN UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR IT'S WAY WAY TRUE SHOWS ME AROUND A FULL SCALE MODEL OF A SUBMARINE THAT WILL EVENTUALLY LAUNCH FROM THIS MOTHER SHIP MOST IMPORTANT PART IS THIS
CAMERON ALISON IT'S ABOUT TEN METRES LONG BRIGHT RED AND INSIDE THERE'S ROOM FOR A CREW OF THREE PROFESSOR IT'S WAY HAS SET UP A COMPANY CALLED RAINBOW FISH AND ITS GOAL IS TO TAKE HUMANS TO THE DEEPEST PART OF THE OCEAN THE MARIANA TRENCH WHICH LIES NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND METRES DOWN IN THE PACIFIC
UP TO NOW HE'S NO MUCH LESS A BACH HAS A DEEPER O'SHEA'S THEN NO
ABOUT AS A SOPHIE'S WITH OUR MOANS AND MARS THAT WHY WE WOUND TO DEVELOP A SUBA MACER BIRSS POOR DITCHES IT DEEPER SEAT
THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE SEA AS A PLACE ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND THE DEEPEST DIVE EVER MADE BY MAN AT THE CAR AND I DON'T WASH WENT DOWN SEVEN MILES IN THE MARIANA TRENCH THE VERY FIRST EXPEDITION WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY WHEN U.S. NAVY MAN DOG WALTZ AND SWISS EXPLORER JACQUES PICCARD MADE THE RECORD BREAKING DIE
BUT THEY WERE FOLLOWED DECADES LATER BY HOLLYWOOD DIRECTOR JAMES CAMERON WHO TOOK THE PLUNGE ALONE IN TWENTY TWELVE IN A BRIGHT GREEN SUBMARINE
RAINBOW FISH WANTS TO BE NEXT CARRYING OUT A DIVE IN TWENTY NINETEEN BUT CHINA'S GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO SET ITS SIGHTS ON THE DEEP IT'S MANNED CHAO LONG SUBMERSIBLE HAS CARRIED OUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED DIVES REACHING AN IMPRESSIVE SEVERAL KILOMETRES DOWN
NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING A NEW VESSEL THAT CAN GO EVEN DEEPER ITS PURPOSE THEY STRESS IS SCIENTIFIC BUT WHILE CHINA IS INVOLVED IN TERRITORIAL DISPUTES IN PLACES LIKE THE SOUTH CHINA SEA SOME FEAR MARINE TECHNOLOGY COULD TIGHTEN CHINA'S CONTROL ON THE OCEAN
BUT THE RAINBOW FISH TEAM SAYS IT'S VENTURE ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS
WHOOSHING IS THE COMPANY'S MANAGING DIRECTOR HOLD ON THE WHOLE RESEARCH IS INSIDE A CHILD NOW BUT WE'RE CONSIDERED THIS IS A VERY MUCH INTERNATIONAL CO OPERATION WE GET AN AMERICAN SCIENTIST THAT THE RUSSIA SCIENTISTS THE EUROPEANS FOUND HIS AN UP OR BE PART OF THE TEAM FOR NOW THE DEEPEST DEPTHS REMAIN A MYSTERIOUS ALIEN WORLD BUT CHINA'S UNDERWATER PLANS ARE PROGRESSING QUICKLY AND IT COULD BE THE NATION THAT WILL OPEN UP THIS FINAL FRONTIER
PROFESSOR WAY AGAIN I WANT TO LIKE THERE'LL BE THE FORCE OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE PUT LEECHES OR MIGHT ANY CHANGE
WE CREATED OUR PRESENT A HISTORY THAT'S MAKING ME EXCITING LOOK AT THAT
FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE TIMES THIS MORNING HAS A FASCINATING ACCOUNT OF HOW BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES FIRED A MISSILE AT AN ISLAMIC STATE TRUCK PACKED WITH EXPLOSIVES IN LIBYA IT'S EVIDENCE THAT EVEN WITHOUT GROUND TROOPS BEING SENT TO THE COUNTRY EVEN WITHOUT A DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BRITISH FORCES DO YOU HAVE A COMBAT ROLE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO ANTHONY LLOYD THE TIMES CORRESPONDENT WHO'S IN THE LIBYAN CITY OR MISS ROSSER
ANSWER US WE'RE SPECIAL FORCES BLOWING UP STOOD LIKE THIS
THEY ARE ARE BEING USED IN LIBYA AND RUBBING HIS TOO
STATE WEAPONS THAT LOCAL LIBYAN FORCES SEEM QUITE UNABLE
AND THAT LOCAL LIBYAN FORCES MIZ THIS ROTTEN WHO PROVED THEMSELVES MORE THAN
APPEARS NEXT IN TRYING TO DEAL WITH VERY FORCE MOVING SHOES
I'D BE WILL SLIP IN ALL THAT AND QUITE SORT OF CONFUSED AS TO HOW TO DEAL WITH ISLAMIC STATE TACTICS AND WITHOUT THE INPUT OF FOREIGN SPECIAL
BEATEN ON THE BATTLEFIELD BY DEREK YOUR ACCOUNT HAS PEOPLE RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY SEE ONE OF THESE SUICIDE VEHICLES EXCEPT FOR A SMALL TEAM OF BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES
TO THOSE WHO WERE IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY OF THIS A VEHICLE COMING HURTLING DOWN THE ROAD
NICK THEN THIS WEAPON MURDER GOOD
BUT IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT
WHEN IT EXPLODES CHILDREN OR PEOPLE
CLOSE CHARGE HOWEVER THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES TEAM WITH A GROUP OF LIBYAN COMMANDED
WE'RE TALKING A COUPLE OF KILOMETRES AWAY FROM THE APPROACH TO THIS VEHICLE
MAP COORDINATES A BREW
THE VEHICLES COMING FORM
NOT AT ALL
THE WAY THEY TOOK OUT THE WEAPON AND THERE IS A VIEW PRESUMABLY FROM THOSE LIBYAN FORCES THAT WITHOUT THAT BRITISH HELP WITHOUT THE AMERICANS TOO THEY WOULD CONSISTENTLY HAVE SETBACKS AT THE HANDS OF
PRIVATELY GOOD TO HELP HER WORSE AND SPECIAL
AND KNOW WITHOUT WESTERN SPECIAL
WEAPONS AND TAXES BUYS HER MYSTERY SPECIAL FORCES ARE ALWAYS TREATED DIFFERENTLY IN POLITICS BUT THERE WILL BE WON'T THERE PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS IF YOU THINK HOLD ON WE NEVER HAD A VOTE M.P.S NEVER HAD A SAY ON THE LOCATION OF BRITISH FORCES ON THE GROUND IN LIBYA BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN EFFECT
HORSES SUPPORT WHICH GROUPS THEY SUPPORT
OH AND WHO ULTIMATELY BRITAIN MIGHT HELP
LAWKS WEEK AT THE PIANO HELMET A U.S. ANOTHER WORLD
AGREE TO SUPPORT A NEW GOVERNMENT IN TRIPOLI WE LAWN SPECIFICALLY TO BE USED AGAINST ISLAM
AND ALL THE REST OF IT NO I'D MUNCH IS QUITE UNKNOWN UNTIL LLOYD IN LIBYA THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TEN MINUTES TO NINE NEANDERTHALS WERE BUILDING COMPLEX UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES BY FIRELIGHT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO THAT'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE HOMO SAPIENS ARRIVED IN EUROPE THAT'S THE SUGGESTION FROM A PAPER THAT'S BEEN PUBLISHED IN NATURE AND DETAILS MYSTERIOUS SMALL WALLS FOUND DEEP INSIDE A CAVE IN FRANCE IT SUGGESTS THAT THE
ANCIENT COUSINS OF HUMANS WERE CAPABLE OF MORE COMPLEX BEHAVIOUR THAN HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT WERE PROFESSOR CHRIS STRINGER IS RESEARCH ON HUMAN ORIGINS AT THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM AND HE'S IN A RADIO CAR THE MONEY PROFESSOR STRINGER GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS FINDING AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE
WELL IT IS A REMARKABLE FIND BECAUSE AS YOU'VE SAID THIS IS FAR FAR OLDER THAN ANY STRUCTURES WE KNOW OF OF THIS COMPLEXITY BUYER EVEN BY MODERN HUMANS AND NOT ONLY THAT IT'S REALLY DEEP WITHIN THE CAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED METRES INTO THIS CAVE SYSTEM SO WELL AWAY FROM ANY NORMAL LIGHTING AND THESE STRUCTURES THERE ARE THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THEM AND ONE OF THEM IS MORE THAN
SIX METRES LONG THE WOLVES ARE ALL OF STALAGMITES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY BROKEN UP AND SELECTED AND THEN BUILT UP
AT LEAST FORTY CENTIMETRES HIGH AND OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MEANING OF THESE IS THIS IS A COMPLETELY EXCEPTIONAL FAR END SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY NEANDERTHALS LIVING THIS FAR IN THE CAVE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME OR DID THE STRUCTURES HAVE SOME OTHER MEANING FOR THE NEANDERTHALS BUT WE HAD PRESUMED THAT THEY WERE WERE FAR MORE PRIMITIVE THAN THAT ARE NOT CAPABLE OF BUILDING SOMETHING LIKE THIS AT SUCH DEPTH USING FIRELIGHT
WELL THERE'S A LONG RUNNING DEBATE ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT THE NEANDERTHALS AREN'T FROM US BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE EVIDENCE HAS BUILT UP THAT
ANY BEHAVIOURAL GAP BETWEEN US AND THEM IS CONSIDERABLY NARROWED BUT IT'S STILL A VERY SURPRISING FIND THE NEANDERTHAL WAS CERTAINLY HAD SOME ASPECTS OF COMPLEX BEHAVIOUR UNDOUBTEDLY BUT THIS SHOWS THAT OBVIOUSLY A GROUP OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY CAPABLY FEEL ORACLES OF ENGINEERING STRUCTURE OF BUILDING QUITE A COMPLEX STRUCTURE PLANNING IT AND EXECUTING IT
WELL AWAY FROM ANYWHERE THAT WE NORMALLY NEW NEANDERTHALS WOULD LIVE THIS IS THE SHOWS THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THEM WERE A SEEMINGLY AT HOME AS DEEP IN THE CAVE AS THEY WERE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE AND THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BINNED FOR LIVING OR COULD IT HAVE BEEN FOR SOME OTHER RITUALISTIC REASON
WELL THIS IS WHAT WE WE DON'T KNOW OF COURSE IN THIS WAS A COLD STAGE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO IT WAS IT WAS A VERY COLD STATION POSSIBLY VERY CAGED BEING A RELATIVELY WARM AND STABLE ENVIRONMENT MAYBE THEY WOULD SIMPLY LIVING DOWN THERE AS A REFUGEE AS AS A MORE HOSPITABLE PLACE
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS THAT WEATHER UNDERNEATH THE PRESENT STRUCTURE COS OF IT'S COVERED BY SEDIMENT THE MIDDLE OF THE STRUCTURES ARE COVERED BY SEDIMENT AND BY CLAVE STALAGMITE MATERIALS BUILT UP RIGHT SO POSSIBLY UNDERNEATH THERE ARE IS EVIDENCE OF THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY LIVING THERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT AT THE MOMENT PROFESSOR CHRIS STRINGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE FOR MANY THE PHRASE DUNKIRK SPIRIT STILL ENCAPSULATES SOMETHING VERY BRITISH SENSE OF DEFIANCE IN THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING ODDS THIS IS HOW THE STORY OF THE MASS EVACUATION OF BRITISH AND ALLIED TROOPS IN MAY NINETEEN FORTY WAS TOLD BY THE B.B.C.'S BERNARD STUBBS WHO WITNESSED THOSE FAMOUS LITTLE SHIPS RETURNING TO DOVER
SOON AFTER DAWN THIS MORNING I WATCHED TWO WARSHIPS STEAMING
LISTING HEAVILY TO PORT UNDER THE ENORMOUS LOAD OF MEN SHE CARRIED ON HER DICKS ALL OF THEM WHAT
WERE COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED BUT THE MOST AMAZING THING WAS THERE PRACTICALLY EVERY MAN WAS REASONABLY CHEERFUL AND MOSTART MANAGED A SMILE
WAS THAT EXTRAORDINARY ACCOUNT NEVERTHELESS SPUN IN MODERN LANGUAGE TO PRESENT DUNKIRK AS MORE LIKE A VICTORY THAN THE REALITY WHICH WAS THAT IT WAS A RETREAT DOCTOR TANYA DANIEL TODMAN JOINS US NOW HE'S HISTORY LITERATURE AT QUEEN MARY AND IS THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK BRITAIN'S WAR INTO BATTLE SPUN MAYBE GOT THE LANGUAGE HE'D USE BUT WAS IT PRESENTED WITH A GLOSS THIS ACCOUNT I THINK THAT'S THAT IDEA OF THE REPORTING OF DUNKIRK PERHAPS BEING PARTIAL
IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING HOW PEOPLE LISTENED AND HEARD ABOUT THE EVENT AT THE TIME SO STUBBS B.B.C.'S NAVAL CORRESPONDENT FROM BEFORE THE WAR
DEFINITELY IN THAT REPORT YOU HEAR HIM TALKING A BELT THE RETREAT FROM DUNKIRK IN TERMS OF NATIONAL HEROISM ENDURANCE AND EPIC OF SURVIVAL THAT SHOWS THAT BRITAIN IS GOING TO TO NOT BE PUT OUT OF THE WAR BY THIS GREAT FEAT AT ANY TIME THERE IS ALWAYS PRESSURE ON JOURNALISM BROADCASTER SAYS IT WOULD TO BE PART OF THE NATIONAL EFFORT PARTICULARLY IF THIS IS SEEN AS A WAR THAT MIGHT THREATEN
THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY ITSELF BUT ARE YOU SAYING SOMETHING MORE IN THE BOOK THAT THERE WAS DIRECT CO OPERATION WITH THE MILITARY AND THE B.B.C. WELL ACTUALLY AT THIS POINT THE B.B.C.'S UNDER GREATER STATE CONTROL THAN AT ANY OTHER POINT IN ITS HISTORY BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL I THINK ABOUT THINKING THAT THIS IS JUST THE RESULT OF A STATE PROPAGANDA MACHINE ACTUALLY
THE SYSTEMS FOR PRESENTING THE WATER THE PUBLIC ARE NOT WORKING AS WELL AT THIS POINT AS THEY WOULD BE LATER ON AND DO THE FALL OF FRANCE HAS HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY SO A CONFUSION ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING SO ACTUALLY WHAT YOU SEE I THINK HE'S DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE MACHINE SOMETIMES GIVING DIFFERENT STORIES SO A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THIS BROADCAST
THE DIRECTOR OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE FOR THE BUT IT LITERALLY FORCE GETS ONTO THE RADIO AND EXPLAINS THAT ALTHOUGH THIS HAS BEEN A DEFEAT THE ARMY'S GOING TO SURVIVE AND IT DEFINITELY WASN'T THE SOLDIERS FAULT IT'S THE FAULT OF THE PRE WAR GOVERNMENT THE FAULT OF THE FRENCH AND THE BELGIANS AND THAT CAUSES OUTRAGE IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE IN THE WAR OFFICE BECAUSE HOW CAN SOMEBODY BE SAYING THE THINGS ABOUT BRITAIN'S ALLIES
OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY WAYS GOT ITS REPUTATION DURING THE WAR FOR ITS INDEPENDENCE AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU ENSURE AT TIMES LIKE THAT THAT IT IS NOT PROPAGANDA THAT YOU'RE PRODUCING
WELL I I THINK AT THE TIME PEOPLE WOULD PEOPLE STUBBS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE SEEN THEMSELVES AS PRODUCING PROPAGANDA THE B.B.C. IS RUN BY PEOPLE WHO ARE PATRIOTIC WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IN VERY BROAD TERMS AND I THINK THEY SEE THEMSELVES AS REPORTING INDEPENDENTLY BUT WITH A PARTICULAR THEY DOING SOMETHING FOR THE NATION YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT THAT BRITAIN'S WAR INTO BATTLE DOCTOR DANIEL TOOK THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU THE TIME IS NOW FOUR MINUTES TO NINE
