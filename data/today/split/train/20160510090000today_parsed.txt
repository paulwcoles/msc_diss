THE FARMER OF WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS CLAIMED THAT DAVID CAMERON WAS FORCED TO ABANDON ONE OF THE KEY DEMANDS HE WAS PLANNING IN HIS Y. YOU RE NEGOTIATIONS LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THEY WERE UNVEILED BECAUSE GERMANY TOLD HIM TO MISTER DUNCAN SMITH WHO QUIT THE CABINET IN MARCH HAS TOLD THE SUN THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WANTED AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON Y. U. MIGRATION TO THE U.K. BUT AGREED TO DROP THE DEMAND BECAUSE OF PROTESTS FROM BERLIN
HE SUGGESTS THE WHOLE SPEECH MISTER CAMERON DELIVERED SETTING OUT BRITAIN'S DEMANDS IN NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS SHOWN TO THE GERMANS BEFOREHAND FOR APPROVAL DOWNING STREET SAYS MISTER CAMERON HAS HAD HIMSELF DECIDED A DIFFERENT WAY OF DEALING WITH THE ISSUE WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CAROLE WALKER
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH TOLD THE SUN THAT AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON E.U. MIGRATION WAS IN MISTER CAMERON'S DRAFT SPEECH UNTIL THE MIDNIGHT HOUR BUT IT WAS DROPPED BECAUSE OF A DE FACTO VETO BY THE GERMANS HE ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER A PUTTING BRITAIN IN A COMPLIANT POSITION TO ANOTHER COUNTRY WHICH DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE OUR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART
THE FINAL DEAL INCLUDED AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON BENEFITS NOT ON MIGRATION A DOWNING STREET SPOKESMAN SAID THE PRIME MINISTER MADE CLEAR AT THE TIME THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD DECIDED AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON MIGRATION WAS NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY FORWARD AND DECIDED TO RESTRICT BENEFITS INSTEAD TO END THE SOMETHING FOR NOTHING CULTURE

U. THE AUTHOR SAY THIS IS TRUE IN FOREIGN POLICY DEFENCE POLICY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE MATTERS
THE FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY AND LEAVE CAMPAIGNER LIAM FOX HAS DISMISSED THE WARNING IS OUT OF DATE HE SAID THE SIGNATORIES WERE FROM A VERY DIFFERENT ERA

DEBATE AMONG BUSINESS LEADERS IN ITS FINAL POLL BEFORE THE REFERENDUM THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE FOUND SUPPORT FOR HER STAYING IN HAD DROPPED FROM SIXTY PERCENT TO FIFTY FOUR PERCENT SINCE FEBRUARY THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BUSINESS PEOPLE SURVEYED WISHING TO LEAVE HAS RISEN FROM THIRTY TO THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT

WEATHER CENTRE GOOD MORNING MATT GOOD MORNING MICHELLE TAKE A MORNING TO AS WELL ONCE AGAIN PARTS U.K. SIZZLED IN THE SUNSHINE YESTERDAY ISLE OF SKYE RECORDED THEIR WARMEST MAY DAY ON RECORD TEMPERATURES REACHING TWENTY SIX POINT SEVEN DEGREES ANOTHER WILL WANT TO COME ACROSS SCOTLAND TODAY PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST ANOTHER DRY SUNNY DAY WITH THEIR CLEAR BLUE SKIES FOR THE VAST MAJORITY LIVE BIT OF LOW CLOUD ACROSS SOME EASTERN AREAS BUT THAT SHOULD
QUICKLY CLEAR AND BREAK THROUGH THE NEXT FEW HOURS TEMPERATURES THOUGH WITH THE WIND COMING IN OFF THE NORTH SEA SOMEWHERE AROUND THIRTEEN TO SEVENTEEN ACROSS EASTERN PARTS TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE CELSIUS IN THE WEST FOR MUCH OF NORTHERN IRELAND ANOTHER DRY DAY LITTLE BIT MORE CLOUD AROUND TODAY AND THIS MORNING ACROSS PARTS OF THE COUNTY DOWN AND ANTRIM AS WELL AS A MOTHER COULD JUST BE ONE OR TWO SHOWERS BUT MOST WILL STAY DRY THROUGH THE DAY THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE TO THE NORTH COAST HIGHS OF AROUND NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWO DEGREES
FOR NORTHERN ENGLAND HAVE GOT A FEW HEAVY SHOWERS TO LANCASHIRE AND SOUTH CUMBRIA THEY WILL EASE AWAY MOST WILL HAVE A BIT ON THE DRY DAY WITH SOME SUNSHINE BEST OF WHICH ACROSS CUMBRIA AND NORTHUMBERLAND ELEMENTS THERE WAS STILL BE FLICKING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON IN THE LIKES OF LIVERPOOL MANCHESTER LEEDS SHEFFIELD HULL YOU COULD SEE SOME HEAVY RAIN LATER ON THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN ON THE EASTERN COAST TWENTY TWO IN THE WEST

THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS THE LATEST IN THE DEBATE OVER THE E.U. REFERENDUM FEATURES ON THE FRONT PAGE THE TELEGRAPH AND THE TIMES DIFFERENT STORIES THOUGH BOTH FOCUSED ON LETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN TO THEIR RESPECTIVE PAPERS BECAUSE FIVE FORMER NATO CHIEFS HAVE WRITTEN TO THE TELEGRAPH WARNING THAT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD GIVE SUCCOUR TO THE WEST'S ENEMIES
THEY SAY THE FULMINATE ACHIEVED SERVED BETWEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THEY SAY IT'LL BE TROUBLING IT BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE SIGNATORIES AND GOOD LORD CARRINGTON WHO WAS THE SERVE THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THEY ALSO POINT OUT ALSO THE LAST SURVIVING MEMBER OF CHURCHILL'S GOVERNMENT OTHER TIMES THE LETTER WRITTEN TO IT IS FROM THIRTEEN FORMER U.S. SECRETARIES OF STATE AND DEFENCE AGAIN
THEY SAY THAT DON'T VOTE FOR BREAKFAST BRECK'S IT THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT BRITAIN MUST NOT BANK ON ITS SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS OF GLOBAL INFLUENCE IT WOULD SUFFER IF IT LEFT THE E. YOU THEY SAY THAT THE COUNTRY'S PLACE AND INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD WOULD BE DIMINISHED IN EUROPE WILL BE DANGEROUSLY WEAKENED AFTER A VOTE TO LEAVE
THE DAILY MAIL'S LEAD STORY THOUSANDS OF HOT VICTIMS KILLED BY PAUL CARE ITSELF THEY SINK THAT HEADLINE HONOUR STUDY THAT'S BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL AFTER RESEARCH CARRIED OUT BY THE UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS AND UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON RESEARCHERS ANALYSE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES OF THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF HEART ATTACK IN HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND AND WALES OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND FOR EACH CASE THEY CHECKED IF THE PATIENT HAD BEEN GIVEN
THIRTEEN TREATMENTS INCLUDING SCANS DRUGS AND MEDICAL ADVICE IT FOUND THAT IN EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT OF CASES PATIENTS DID NOT RECEIVE AT LEAST ONE OF THE INTERVENTIONS FOR EXAMPLE A DRUGS CRUCIAL SCANS OR INDEED THE RIGHT TYPE OF ADVICE AFTERWARDS AND THE RESEARCHERS CONCLUDED THAT IF ALL PATIENTS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD HAD RECEIVED THE INVESTIGATION AND TREATMENTS FOR WHICH THEY WERE ELIGIBLE AROUND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DEATHS MAY HAVE BEEN PREVENTED
THE DAILY MAIL SAYS THAT SHOCKINGLY THE RESEARCHERS HAVE WARNED THAT THE TRUE NUMBER OF NEEDLESS DEATHS COULD BE TWICE AS HIGH AS THEIR ESTIMATE NOW THE TIMES PICKS UP ON A RATHER SURPRISING STORY ABOUT A PRINCIPAL IN THE ROYAL BALLET HE'S GOT A LITTLE BIT INFURIATED PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY BY SOME COMMENTS OF A REVIEWER IN THE PRINCIPLE IS EDWARD WATSON AND HE HAS GINGER HAIR REDHEAD HE'S A REDHEAD
HE SAYS THIS RATHER IRRITATES HER REVIEW HE DOESN'T NAME THE REVERE BUT THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT IT'S SOMEBODY GOOD ALISTAIR MCAULEY IN THE NEW YORK TIMES WHO'S TWICE REFERRED TO WATSON'S PALE SKIN AND AUBURN HAIR IN NEGATIVE REVIEWS HE'S DESCRIBED HIM AS FREAKISH AND OVERWROUGHT MIND YOU THIS REVIEWER HAS ALSO DESCRIBED HIS BALLET PARTNER JENNIFER RINGER AS FAT
DAGGERS DRAWN IN THE WORLD BELL THERE'S THE VAPOURS THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX A FIFTH OF THE CANADIAN TOWN OF FORT MCMURRAY HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY THE WILDFIRE THAT'S BEEN RAGING IN CENTRAL CANADA OF THE PAST WEEK OUR NORTH AMERICA CORRESPONDENT LAURA BAKER WAS A AMONG JOURNALISTS ALLOWED INTO THE TOWN TO SEE THE DAMAGE
THE FIRST THING IS WHEN YOU DRIVE TOWARDS FOR MY MONEY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE ONLY ALLOWED IN UNDER POLICE ESCORT IN WHY IT'S STILL NOT SAFE TO RETURN AS YOU DRIVE ALONG THE MAIN HIGHWAY SIXTY THREE ALONG THE SIDES THE TWEEZER STILL SMOULDERING THEY ARE STILL THROWING WATER ON FROM HELICOPTERS AND IT'S JUST ENTIRELY
THEN YOU COME INTO FORT MCMURRAY ITSELF AND YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE EDGES OF THE DAMAGE THERE'S A RESTAURANT O'BRIEN YOU RESTAURANT HAS JUST BEEN UTTERLY DESTROYED IN THE ONE NEXT TO IT IS COOKED IS STILL STANDING AND THEN THEY TOOK US TO THE WORST HIT NEIGHBOURHOOD IT'S A NEIGHBOURHOOD COLBY CAN HELL THIS IS WHERE FAMILIES WE'D HAVE STEVE IT'S WITH ONE OF THE NICEST NEIGHBOURHOODS IN FORT MCMURRAY AND IT IS
UTTERLY DESTROYED YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THAT HOLMES HAD BEEN THERE YOU CAN TELL THE FEROCITY OF THE FIRE BECAUSE THE METAL HAS BEEN TWISTED WITH THE HEAT ALL THAT'S LEFT ARE THE PHONE DACIANS OF HOMES YOU CAN TELL THEY HAVE BEEN GARDENS ZERO BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE GARDEN EQUIPMENT BUT STILL THAT IS THE ONLY SIGN THAT THIS HAS BEEN OUR HOME THE ENTIRE FABRIC THAT MAKES A HOME HAS GONE
IT'S ALMOST IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE FIRE HAS JUST RAVAGED ITS WAY THROUGH AND THEN YOU TURN ANOTHER CORNER AND THE HOSPITAL SYLVIA THE SCHOOL STILL THERE THERE'S A PLAYGROUND STILL THERE AND YOU CAN FEEL THAT THERE YOU'RE STILL BACK IN THE CITY AND THEN YOU GO ONTO THE NEXT NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT'S BEEN DESTROYED SO THIS FIRE HAS BEEN VERY VERY UNPREDICTABLE FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO TRY TO GET UNDER CONTROL WHAT ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN EVACUATED WHAT ABOUT THEM
FOR THOSE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN EVACUATED FROM FORMING THEIR ENDING AREAS THEY ARE BEGINNING TO REALISE THAT IT WON'T JUST BE A FEW DAYS IT WON'T JUST BE A FEW WEEKS IT MIGHT BE MONTHS BEFORE THEY WILL RETURN HOME DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE THE BEAR TO PREMIER RITUAL NOTLEY SAID LOOK WE ARE PUTTING A PLAN IN PLACE BUT IT'LL BE TWO WEEKS BEFORE WE EVEN HAVE A PLAN AND THEN WE WILL WORK AT SEEING
WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN RETURN HOME THERE ARE TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED HOMES IN FORT MCMURRAY THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AND THEY'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT AND WEIRD THEY CAN BE REBUILT BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO POWER THERE'S NO WATER THERE'S NO GAS AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE WERE ALLOWED IN WAS UNDER POLICE SUPERVISION SIR CERTAINLY RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN TOLD BE PATIENT BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN SEE THEIR CITY AGAIN
THAT WAS LAURA BECAUSE REPORTING FROM CANADA THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ONE YEAR OLD BEN NEEDHAM ON THE GREEK ISLAND OF COS A TEAM OF BRITISH POLICE OFFICERS WILL BE MAKING A FRESH APPEAL OVER THE CASE OUR CORRESPONDENT YOU GITA LYNN MY JOINS US FROM COS AN APPEAL ON WHAT BASIS YOU GITA
THEY ARE HOPING TO MAKE AN APPEAL FOR ANYONE WHO'S GOT ANY INFORMATION ON THIS ISLAND OR IN THIS COUNTRY TO COME FORWARD THERE REALLY FOCUS REALLY IS ON PUTTING OUT THE MESSAGE IN THE GREEK MEDIA AND SOME PHONE NUMBERS OUT THERE BUT I ACTUALLY AT THE SITE WHERE BEN DISAPPEARED FROM IT'S A FARMHOUSE IN BEAUTIFUL COS COUNTRYSIDE NOW THIS IS AN ISLAND OBVIOUSLY SURROUNDED BY WATER BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY INLAND IT'S A LITTLE BIT UP IN THE MOUNTAINS SO YOU'VE GOT
BIG BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS BEHIND AND A GREAT VIEW OF THE SEA AND IT'S VERY QUIET MANY PARTS OF COURSE ARE QUITE TOURISTY BUT THIS LOOKS LIKE AN AREA WHERE IT'S ACTUALLY JUST THE LOCALS WHO STAY ONE NARROW ROAD WHICH IS JUST ABOUT WIDE ENOUGH TO FIT A VEHICLE AND THIS IS WHERE HIS GRANDPARENTS WERE STAYING AND THIS IS WHERE HE DISAPPEARED FROM WHILE HIS MOTHER WAS WORKING AT A LOCAL HOTEL
AND THE FACT THAT THE POLICE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE APPEAL THERE SUGGESTS THAT THEY STILL THINK TWENTY FIVE YEARS ON THAT SOMEONE ON COURSE MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING MIGHT SAY SOMETHING NOW
THAT SUDDENLY WHAT HIS MOTHER VERY STRONGLY BELIEVES KERRY NEED WAS ALSO EXPECTED TO BE HERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR FROM NOW AND THAT'S WHY LAST YEAR SHE APPEARED ON A GREEK TELEVISION SHOW PUTTING OUT AN APPEAL THEN HE'S WELL FOR ANY INFORMATION ABOUT HER SON SHE STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT SOMEONE ON COURSE STILL NO SOMETHING AND PERHAPS ANY INFORMATION EVEN IF IT SEEMS INSIGNIFICANT TO THEM MIGHT ACTUALLY HELP IN THE SEARCH FOR HER SON
THE GITA LEE MY ON COST THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST SIX THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES WHO WANT BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. HAS FALLEN VICTORIA FRITZ IS BACK WITH US FOR THE BUSINESS THIS MORNING VICTORIA GOOD MORNING TO YOU YES NOT ONLY THAT SARAH BUT ACCORDING TO A SURVEY
BY THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE THE PERCENTAGE OF BUSINESS LEADERS THAT WANTS BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS RISEN BY SEVEN PERCENT IN ONLY TWO MONTHS SO WE'VE SEEN A NARROWING IN THE VOTING INTENTIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO RUN BRITAIN'S BUSINESSES AS THINGS STAND THE LOBBY GROUP CLAIMS THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT OF EXECUTIVES SAY THEY WOULD VOTE TO LEAVE AND FIFTY FOUR PERCENT WISH TO REMAIN IN THE E.U.
I'M JOINED NOW BY ADAM MARSHALL THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE CHAMBERS GOOD MORNING TO YOU ADAM GOOD MORNING IS IT ONLY NATURAL THAT AS WE COME CLOSER TO THAT REFERENDUM DATE THE POLL SUCH AS YOURS WOULD NARROW WHAT DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON I THINK IT IS NATURAL BECAUSE I THINK BUSINESS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A WIDE RANGING DEBATE AND ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH SIDES I THINK WHAT THE SURVEY SHOWS IS THAT BUSINESS OPINION CAN BE DYNAMIC AND FLUID AND INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS PEOPLE MAY INDEED CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT THE SUBJECT
THERE IS OF COURSE STILL EIGHT PER CENT THAT IS UNDECIDED ACCORDING TO YOUR POLE OR DO YOU THINK MEMBERS ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD OF THOSE WHO EXPRESSED A PREFERENCE TO EITHER REMAIN OR LEAVE NINETY PER CENT OF THEM SAY THEY'RE NOW VERY COMMITTED TO THE VIEW THAT THEY'VE EXPRESSED SO THEY'RE NOT FROM MOVING IT'S ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WHO'VE ALREADY STATED A PREFERENCE NOW SAY THAT THEY MIGHT CHANGE IT AND ON THE EIGHT PER CENT ARE STILL UNDECIDED SO THE NUMBER OF BUSINESS PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT PITCH THEIR SIDE AND DECIDED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO STICK WITH IT IS IN FACT SHRINKING
SO WE HAVE QUITE A HIGH CONFIDENCE LEVEL IN THE SURVEY NOW OF COURSE WE'VE HAD A PLETHORA OF REPORTS FROM PURCHASING MANAGER SUGGESTING THAT INVESTMENT IN THIS COUNTRY IS STALLED GROWTH IS VIRTUALLY NON EXISTENT AS A RESULT OF UNCERTAINTY OVER THE REFERENDUM YOU REPRESENT BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES DO THEY SEEM FEARFUL TO YOU HAVE THE REFERENDUM AND OF ITS RESULT I SPENT QUITE A LOT OF TIME VISITING WITH BUSINESSES I WAS IN THE BLACK COUNTRY AND ALSO UP IN YORK JUST LAST WEEK
AND WHEN YOU TALK TO FIRMS LARGER AND SOME MEDIUM SIZED FIRMS DO TALK ABOUT THE REFERENDUM AS BEING ONE OF THE FACTORS CAUSING THEM TO PUT OFF SOME DECISIONS ARE PERHAPS TAKE DIFFERENT DECISIONS THEN THEY OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE DONE FOR MANY SMALLER FIRMS THOUGH OF COURSE NEXT WEEK IS THERE TIME HORIZON AND THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN IT THAT MUCH CONSIDERATION SO ANYTHING AFFECTING THEM
IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WIDER ECONOMY NOT JUST THE REFERENDUM ALONE AND SMALL BUSINESSES MAKE UP THAT THE BACKBONE OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S WHERE WHAT WE ARE SAYING TO OUR POLITICIANS IN WESTMINSTER IS THIS YOU'VE HAD TUNNEL VISION ABOUT THE REFERENDUM NOW FOR BETTER PART OF A YEAR WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT MATTERED TO BUSINESSES WHETHER THAT BE GETTING THE SKILLS THEY NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO THAT ONCE THE REFERENDUM IS OVER ON JUNE THE TWENTY FOURTH
O.K. ADAM FOR THE MOMENT WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE NOW OF COURSE WE'VE HAD A FLURRY OF FIGURES FROM THE HOUSING MARKET TO THE HIGH STREETS THAT HAVE ADDED TO EVIDENCE OF A GO SLOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE BRITISH ECONOMY A REPORT TODAY FROM THE BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM REVEALS THAT SHOP SALES STALLED FOR THEIR SECOND MONTH IN A ROW MOST NOTABLY ONLINE RETAIL SELLS SOMETHING OF A BRIGHT SPOT IN RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN THE SLOWEST GROWTH IN THREE YEARS HERE'S HELEN DICKINSON FROM THERE BE ARSEY
WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE IS SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT WE ALL INTERACT MORE AND MORE OF US ARE USING BOTH STORES AND ONLINE WHETHER IT IS THROUGH OUR PHONES
AT OUR DESKS OR AT HOME ON A HOME COMPUTERS AND THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT IS ONLINE AND OFFLINE IS MUCH MORE BLURRED THAN IT WAS BEFORE SO WHITE IT ALMOST BECOMES LESS RELEVANT IN TERMS OF HOW YOU ACTUALLY MEASURE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO THEY ALL BECOME PART OF OUR INTERACTION A SHOPPING EXPERIENCE
OUR MARKET'S GUESS THIS MORNING AS LAURA LAMBIE SHE'S A SENIOR INVESTMENT DIRECTOR ADAM BEST WEALTH AND INVESTMENT AND SHE JOINS US NOW FROM GLASGOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU LAURA GOOD MORNING NOW THERE'S BEEN TWO RETAIL ADMINISTRATIONS IN RECENT WEEKS OF COURSE THE DEPARTMENT STORE B.H.S. AND THE FASHION RETAILER AUSTIN REED THE REPORTING SEASON SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PEPPERED SO FAR WITH PROFIT WARNINGS IT'S A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME
IT'S NOT BEEN EASY FOR THE FOR THE HIGH STREET OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE HAD SOME BIG NAMES ANNOUNCING DISAPPOINTING PERFORMANCE IS SUCH AS NEXT BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME BRIGHT SPARK A QUITE INTERESTINGLY H.M.V. WHICH YOU MEMBER WENT BUST NOT SO LONG AGO WAS TAKEN OVER AGAIN AND IT'S PREDOMINANTLY HIGH STREET
AND IT IS NOW GAINING DRAINED ON ITS ONLINE COMPETITORS AS I THINK CONSUMERS PERHAPS QUITE LIKE THE FEEL OF BUYING D.V.D.S AND GAMES AND C.D.S FROM PHYSICAL SHOPS SO I THINK US AS HELEN DICKINSON SAID IT'S TRYING TO GET THE MIX RIGHT BETWEEN HIGH STREET AND ONLINE THIS THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE BOTH
AND OF COURSE THE RETAIL FOOTPRINT IN THE U.K. SEEMS TO BE SHRINKING ANOTHER SET OF DATA PUBLISHED TODAY PURPORTS TO SHOW THE EFFECT THAT NEXT MONTH REFERENDUM AS HAVING WITH NERVOUS EMPLOYERS CHOOSING TEMPORARY OVER PERMANENT STAFF WHILE THEY AWAIT THE RESULTS IF I CAN JUST BRING ADAM MARSHALL OF THE BCD BACK INTO THIS DISCUSSION NOW YOU WERE OFTEN TALKING ABOUT THE SKILL SHORTAGE IN THIS COUNTRY YET INCREASINGLY BUSINESSES ARE TURNING TO TEMPORARY AN AGENCY WORKERS
BUSINESSES NEED TO CHOOSE DON'T THEY DO THEY WANT A FLEXIBLE WORKFORCE WHAT DO THEY WANT TO BETTER SKILLED ONE ALL BUSINESSES WANTED BETTER SKILLED WORKFORCE AND THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU SEE FROM THEM ON THAT IS ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT BUT IN TIMES OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPANIES OUT THERE THAT PRIZE FLEXIBILITY SO WHETHER THAT'S THE REFERENDUM HAD OF THAT SOME OF THE GLOBAL CONDITIONS IN COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA THAT BUSINESSES ARE SEEING OR INDEED THE SLOWING ECONOMY HERE AT HOME I THINK YOU'RE ENTERING INTO A PERIOD WHERE THAT FLEXIBILITY IS BECOMING MORE PRIZED BY COMPANY
AND SPEAKING OF THOSE SORT OF WIDER ISSUES A LAW IT SEEMS A LONG TIME AGO THAT THE CHANCELLOR WAS WARNING OF A DANGEROUS COCKTAIL OF ECONOMIC RISKS AT LARGELY OUTSIDE THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN LONGER STILL SINCE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBLE GREEK SOVEREIGN DEBT DEFAULT HAVE THESE THREATS GONE AWAY NO RESUS HAS REARED ITS HEAD AGAIN
THIS IS ON THE BACK OF HER DEBT REPAYMENTS IN JULY AND THE THEY'RE THE FINANCE HEADS OF THE MAJOR EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN GETTING AROUND THE TABLE AND TRYING TO WORK OUT JUST HOW THEY CAN SUPPORT THAT THEY DO NOT DEFAULT ON THIS DEBT REPAYMENT
OF COURSE THE OTHER BIG THREAT OR AT LEAST BIG SLOWDOWN WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE WORLD AS CHINA IT SEEMS THAT CHINA IS AWASH WITH CREDIT STIMULUS IN FACT THERE'S MORE OF THE STUFF RELATIVE TO G.D.P. ECONOMIC GROWTH THEN THERE WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WHEN IT WAS OF COURSE UNLEASHED BY BEIJING Y. ISN'T IT HAVING THE DESIRED EFFECT ON THE CHINESE ECONOMY
I THINK YOU DO HAVE TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT WE HAD A LOT OF IT'S SOMETIMES CONFLICTING FIGURES FROM CHINA WITH
YESTERDAY EXPORTS WERE DOWN AND BUY ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT IMPORT STONE BY TEN POINT NINE BUT MORE RECENTLY OVERNIGHT WE'VE HAD PRODUCER TRACES WHICH HAVE DECLINED AT THE SLOWER STREET FOR SIXTEEN YEARS SO THERE'S QUITE A MIXED MESSAGES MESSAGE COMING THROUGH YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THOUGH THAT THE CHINA STILL GROWING AT OVER SIX PERCENT I THINK A FIGURE THAT MOST WESTERN ECONOMIES WOULD BITE YOUR ARM OR FOUR SO
IT'S IT'S ALWAYS WORRYING IF THE SECOND BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND THE GROWTH OF SLOWING BUT WE NEED TO WE NEED TO KEEP THAT IN CONTEXT I THINK ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THERE IS SOME SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER THAT SIX PERCENT FIGURE IS ACCURATE DO YOU THINK THOUGH THAT YOU KNOW THE CORPORATE DEBT LEVELS THAT WE'RE SEEING PARTICULARLY AND NOTABLY IN ASIA IS THE NEXT TO FINANCIAL CRISIS WAITING TO HAPPEN
I THINK RECENT HISTORY WOULD DICTATE THAT THEY THERE IT'S STILL FRESH IN THEIR MINDS AND SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THE BUBBLE BURSTING THAT WE DID WITH THE MORE DEVELOPED ECONOMIES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE LAYER AT THE LESSONS OF THAT AND I SUSPECT IT WILL BE A SOFTER RATHER THAN A HARD LANDING WELL LET'S CERTAINLY HOPE SO ALTHOUGH AT THE MOMENT IT SEEMS THAT MARKETS ARE VERY MUCH DIVIDED ON THAT
YES AND AS A SEE THERE ARE CONFLICTING ECONOMIC FIGURES THERE ARE COMING OUT AND WHEREAS WE SAW MARKETS AND FALLING SLIGHTLY YESTERDAY ON FEARS THAT THE CHINESE AND THE ECONOMY WAS SLOWING DOWN I SUSPECT THAT MIGHT BE REVERSED THIS MORNING ON THE BACK OF A SLIGHTLY POSITIVE FIGURES WE HAVE SEEN THE ASIAN STOCK MARKETS A REBOUND A LITTLE BIT OVERNIGHT LAURA LAMBIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MUM OF THREE WHO LEFT HER JOB BECAUSE SHE WAS TIRED OF THE COMMUTE HAS WON AN AWARD DUBBED THE OSCAR OF WOMEN IN BUSINESS SARAH WOOD HAS ONE OF THE WOMEN IN BUSINESS AWARD AT THE VERVE TIKO AWARDS FOR HER ONLINE VIDEO ADVERTISING FIRM UNRULY THE PRIZE COMES JUST MONTHS AFTER UNRULY WAS SNAPPED UP BY RUPERT MURDOCH'S NEWS FOR REPORTEDLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION SERRA WERE JOINED
I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME CONGRATULATIONS ON THE AWARD I SUSPECT THERE WAS A LOT OF FREE FLOWING CHAMPAGNE LAST NIGHT THANK YOU FOR COMING IN SO EARLY THIS MORNING HOW DO YOU FEEL
CONSIDERING THERE WAS SO MUCH CHAMPAGNE LEFT LIGHT AND SO MUCH GREAT CONVERSATION CELEBRATION I FEEL I FEEL GOOD THIS MORNING IT WAS A WONDERFUL NIGHT LOTS OF WINNERS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS WERE THERE AND IT HAS AN AWARD IT'S GOT SUCH A LONG HISTORY AND TRADITION IT'S BRILLIANT TO BE PART OF THAT MOVEMENT SUPPORTING FEMALE BUSINESS LEADERS LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR COMPANY UNRULY AT IT HELPS VIDEO ADVERTS GO VIRAL NOW I WONDER WHETHER YOU KNOW INSTINCTIVELY WHETHER SOMETHING IS GOING TO WORK OR THERE'S A PRECISE SCIENCE TO THIS
WE WOULD SAY THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE SHARING YOU MAY KNOW INSTINCTIVELY WHAT YOU WOULD SHARE BUT THAT MAY NOT BE THE SAME THING THAT'S A SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL IN INDONESIA WOULD SHARE AT A CERTAIN TIME OF DAY ON A SPECIFIC DEVICE SO WE BRING SCIENCE AND DATA TO THE GUT INSTINCT THAT MANY PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE AND THEN WHAT WE DO IS WE HELP SPREAD THE WORD VERY QUICKLY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE GREAT CONTENT YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE IT AT SPEED AND SCALE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH CONTENT OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET THE BRANDS ARE COMPETING WITH
ABSOLUTELY NO NEWS CALLER PAID ROUGHLY FIFTY PERCENT UP FRONT AND FIFTY PERCENT ON RESULTS FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND VIDEO ADVERTISING OF COURSE IS HAVING MIXED SUCCESS WITH PAY WAR STRATEGIES AND ANOTHER NEW CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS ADD BLOCKING SOFTWARE PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE NOISE TO HOW YOU CAN GET HOLD OF HIM A FIFTY EIGHT MILLION SO VIDEO I'D SPEND IT'S GROWING EXTREMELY QUICKLY AGREE FIFTY PER CENT LAST YEAR IN THE U.K. ACCORDING TO THE I.P.
BUT WITH THAT GROWTH COMES GROWING PAINS IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR THE AD INDUSTRY AS IT MOVES FORWARD THAT IT DOES THAT IT DOESN'T JUST PUT OUT MORE ANTS BUT IT CREATES BETTER ADS AND THEN DISTRIBUTES THEM IN SOCIAL NOT ANTI SOCIAL VIDEO FORMATS SO I'M REALLY A BIG MESSAGES ABOUT FANTASTIC CONTENT DISTRIBUTED IN POLITE ADD FORMATS WHERE THE USER IS ACTUALLY IN CONTROL OF THE EXPERIENCE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE MURDOCH'S DIGITAL TITLES MAKE MORE REVENUE BUT ISN'T A FUTURE FREE CONTENT THESE DAYS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL WATCHING
QUALITY CONTENT HAS A COST AND THIS IS THE ARGUMENT THAT WE AS AN INDUSTRY NEED TO WIN AND WHAT I WOULD SAY THERE IS QUALITY CONTENT TO SERVE QUALITY AND THAT'S WHERE I'M REALLY CAN COME IN AND REALLY HELP OUR VISION IS TO TRANSFORM DIGITAL ADVERTISING FOR THE BETTER AND THAT'S ALL WORKING TOWARDS NOW YOU'RE UNUSUAL FOR A TECH FIRM INSOFAR AS ROUGHLY HALF YOUR STAFF THE FEMALE HALF OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM I BELIEVE OF FEMALE DO YOU POSITIVELY DISCRIMINATE
WE HAD NO NEED TO POSITIVELY DISCRIMINATE BECAUSE WE HAVE AWESOME PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS OF ALL GENDERS COMING TO UNRULY AND FLOURISHING AND WE HAVE A MERITOCRATIC CULTURE WE WORK HARD BUT WE GIVE EVERYBODY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED IT'S MORE ABOUT ATTITUDE THAN SKILL
DO YOU THINK WE NEED A SEPARATE ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FOR WOMEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE IT'S GREAT TO CELEBRATE ANYBODY SUCCESS AS AN ENTREPRENEUR I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS AND AS A MUM OF THREE AND I THINK IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO SHOW YOUNG WOMEN THAT THERE ARE MANY ROUTES TO SUCCESS AND THAT LEADERS DON'T ALL NEED TO LOOK THE SAME SARAH WOULD CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH

THAT'S RIGHT THIS IS THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND IT STARTED ITS INVESTIGATION AFTER THE DRONE STRIKE AGAINST RAHART CALM IN AUGUST LAST YEAR FROM AN R.A.F. DRONE HE WAS IN SYRIA AT THE TIME IN THE U.K. WOULD NOT AUTHORISE PARLIAMENT HAD NOT AUTHORISED ARMED FORCE AGAINST SYRIA SO THERE WAS THIS QUESTION WHAT LEGAL AUTHORITY WAS THIS CARRIED OUT UNDER WAS IT OUTSIDE OF AN ARMED CONFLICT NOW IN THE END THERE WAS CONFUSION OVER WHAT THE EXACT STATUS WAS IN THE END THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THIS WAS
PART OF THE ARMED CONFLICT IN IRAQ WHICH HAD THEN SPILLED OVER IF YOU LIKE INTO SYRIA JUSTIFYING THIS STRIKE BUT THE COMMITTEE THEN LOOKED AT THE BROADER ISSUE WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT POLICY ON CARRYING OUT DRONE STRIKES OUTSIDE OF ARMED CONFLICT AND DOES IT FOR INSTANCE HAVE A SIMILAR
POLICY TO THE U.S. POLICY WHICH IS OFTEN KNOWN AS TARGETED KILLING AND WHICH HAS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL AND THEY FOUND THAT THERE IS A GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT THEY CAN THEY BELIEVE CARRYING OUT DRONE STRIKES AGAINST INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE OF A CONFLICT ZONE OUTSIDE OF AN ARMED CONFLICT WHERE THEY THINK AN IMMINENT TERRORIST ATTACK OR ATTACK ON THE U.K. MIGHT BE PLANNED BUT THE ISSUE FOR THE COMMITTEE WAS WELL UNDER WHAT LEGAL BASIS
IS THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS LAW COMPLIANCE TO THIS IS THEIR CLARITY ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES AN IMMINENT THREAT IN JUSTIFYING A STRIKE IN THE COMMITTEE FOUND THIS SIMPLY WASN'T ENOUGH CLARITY SURROUNDING THIS POLICY WHEN IT CAME TO THE LAW AND WHAT THE CONCERN IS BOTH PRESUMABLY OVER WHO IS TARGETED BUT ALSO ANY SUBSEQUENT LEGAL REPRISALS AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE SITTING THERE AUTHORISING THE ACTION
EXACTLY IT'S WHETHER IT'S WHETHER NOT JUST THE LAWS OF ARMED CONFLICT BUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS LAW APPLIES IN SUCH A CASE WHERE IT'S OUTSIDE OF AN ARMED CONFLICT AND THEREFORE WHETHER YOU NEED TO HAVE A CLEAR JUSTIFICATION WHETHER THEY'D NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR INSTANCE AN INQUEST AN INVESTIGATION AFTER THE FACT AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE FORMS OF LEGAL COMPLIANCE THEN THE COMMITTEE SAYS THERE IS A RISK THAT OTHER COUNTRIES COULD TRY AND PROSECUTE BRITISH OFFICIALS OR OR MILITARY PERSONNEL
FOR NOT BEING COMPLIANT WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW IF THEY HAVEN'T PUT THOSE KIND OF SAFEGUARDS LEGAL SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE OVER THE USE OF DRONES OUTSIDE OF AN ARMED CONFLICT GORDON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER'S REFORM DEAL THE RENEGOTIATION THAT WAS SUCH A FOCUS OF THE END OF LAST YEAR AND UNTIL THE DEAL WAS ANNOUNCED BUT TODAY THE FORMER CABINET MINISTER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHO'S ON THE LEAVES SIDE IS FOCUSING ON IT NORMAN SMITH OR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR JOINS US AND PARTICULARLY HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE STAND THAT GERMANY TOOK ON THE PROCESS NORMAN
MISTER DUNCAN SMITH SUGGESTED IN EFFECT THERE WAS A GERMAN VETO OVER THE DEAL THAT MISTER CAMERON STRUCK PARTICULARLY ON THE ISSUE OF MIGRATION AND THAT MISTER CAMERON SAYS MISTER DUNCAN SMITH WAS ALL SET TO DEMAND THAT THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY BREAK THE BRITAIN WOULD SAY WE'RE GOING TO
HALT ALL E.U. MIGRATION BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURES ON PUBLIC SERVICES AND THAT THAT DEMAND WAS DROPPED AT THE LAST MINUTE SAYS MISTER DUNCAN SMITH BECAUSE OF GERMAN OPPOSITION AND GERMAN WARNING SORT OF MISTER CAMERON DID THAT THAN THEY WOULD FEEL OBLIGED TO ATTACK THAT IDEA AND INSTEAD MISTER CAMERON WAS FORCED TO COME UP WITH THIS RATHER COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF BENEFIT CURVES WHERE
E.U. MIGRANTS GET TAX CREDITS ON A SORT OF TIERED BASES AND THEY GET CHILD BENEFIT ON A PRO RATA BASIS AT THE COST OF LIVING IN THEIR COUNTRY
AND HE SUGGESTS THAT THIS WAS DONE PURELY TO APPEASE THE GERMANS AND HE SAYS QUITE WHAT HE SAYS HE SAYS WE PUT OURSELVES IN A COMPLIANT POSITIONED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY WHICH DOESN'T HAVE OUR BEST INTERESTS NECESSARILY AT HEART NOW A NUMBER TEN THIS MORNING DO YOU NOT CATEGORICALLY DENIED THAT THEY SAY THEY SIMPLY DO NOT RECOGNISE HER I MEAN I THINK THE TRUTH OR SIMPLY THIS THAT
IF THE DEAL WAS GOING TO BE SOLD TO THE REST OF EUROPE THERE MISTER CAMERON YES OF COURSE HE HAD TO HAVE GERMAN BACKING OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE SUNK WITHOUT TRACE AND I THINK IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR ALL ALONG THIS IS MYRTLE HAD MADE A VERY CLEAR GERMANY WAS NEVER GOING TO SIGN UP TO ANYTHING WHICH SHE REGARDED AS CURBING FREE MOVEMENT WITHIN THE E.U.
THE GREY AREA IS EXACTLY HOW MUCH INFLUENCE MISSUS MERKEL EXERTED ON THE PRIME MINISTER HE'S ALSO SAYING IN DUGGAN'S WITH HE'S ALSO SAYING THAT THE U.K. IS NOW IN A WORSE POSITION THAN BEFORE THE RENEGOTIATION IN WHAT WAY IN A NUMBER OF WAYS IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS OF THE DEAL BECAUSE THE BLOOD HE DOESN'T THINK THE MIGRATION BENEFIT COUNCIL MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE PEOPLE COME HERE TO WORK HE SAYS NOT TO CLAIM BENEFITS BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE DEAL MISTER CAMERON HAS
STRUCK HIS EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEVISE THIS BENEFIT SYSTEM WHICH HAS TEARED TAX CREDITS AND PRO RATA CHILD BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF PEOPLE IN POLAND AND ELSEWHERE MORE THAN THAT HE SAYS WE HAVE GIVEN UP OUR RIGHT TO BLOCK
EUROZONE INTEGRATION INSTEAD WE'VE GOT THIS RIGHT TO RAISE CONCERNS OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND WIDE THAT MATTERS IS BECAUSE THE EUROZONE CLEARLY WANTS TO PRESS AHEAD WITH FURTHER HARMONISATION OF BANKING RULES THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE CITY AND HE BELIEVES WE HAVE SURRENDERED OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND IT'S CRUCIAL AREAS THEN JUST BRIEFLY AND NORMAN A DAY AFTER THE SECURITY WAS THE BIG FOCUS WE'VE GOT ANOTHER SET OF LETTERS ARGUING FOR REMAIN WE HAVE FIVE FORMER
SECRETARY GENERALS OF NATO WRITING TO THE TELEGRAPH TODAY CUTTING AWAY AT WHAT WAS IF YOU LIKE THE CENTRAL PILLAR OF THE BRECHT SAID ARGUMENT YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS NATO NOT EUROPE THAT WAS A GUARANTOR OF PEACE THESE MATER LEADER SAYING ACTUALLY THE E. U.TWO IS CRITICAL TO SECURING PEACE AND WERE BRITAIN TO PULL OUT THAT WOULD DAMAGE EUROPE WHICH WOULD QUOTES GIVE SUCCOUR TO THE WEST'S ENEMIES AND ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE THIRTEEN FORMER U.S. SECRETARIES OF STATE SECURITY ADVISERS AND A LETTER TO THE TIMES
SAYING IN EFFECT DON'T COUNT ON THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP TO MAKE UP FOR ANY LOSS OF INFLUENCE IN BRITAIN PULLS OUT OF THE E. U. THAT BRITAIN WILL BE ITS INFLUENCE WILL BE DIMINISHED AND IT SHOULDN'T THINK JUST BECAUSE IT HAS CLOSE TIES WITH THE U.S. THAT IS GOING TO MAKE UP FOR IT SO SECURITY AGAIN IS GOING TO FORM ONE OF THE CENTRAL ELEMENTS OF THE ARGUMENT TODAY NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU IT'S NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE DAILY MAIL CONCLUDES THAT YESTERDAY WAS ONE OF THE MOST FRENZIED OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN SO FAR THE TELEGRAPH TALKS ABOUT THE GLOVES BEING OFF AFTER BORIS JOHNSON CHALLENGE DAVID CAMERON TO ANSWER FIVE KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT REMAINING IN THE E.U. THE PAPER FEELS IT'S REASONABLE TO ASK WHAT HAPPENS NEXT OF BRITAIN STAYS THE DAILY EXPRESS PRAISE AS MISTER JOHNSON FOR MAKING A BARNSTORMING SPEECH SAYING HE MADE THE CASE FOR BRECHT'S IT WITH INTELLIGENCE HONESTY AND CHARISMA
THE GUARDIAN PLEASE MISTER CAMERON MADE A SERIOUS CASE AND HIS SPEECH AND TRIED TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF DEBATE IT SAID HE SET OUT FOR PRACTICAL ARGUMENTS INCLUDING THAT CO OPERATING IN EUROPE PRESERVES INTERNATIONAL STABILITY AND COMBATS THE TERRORIST THREAT BUT THE DAILY MAIL ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER OF EXAGGERATING THE RISKS OF BRECHT'S IT THE SUNSET SAYS IT'S OBVIOUS HE DOES NOT BELIEVE FOR A MOMENT THERE LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD TRIGGER A WORLD WAR THE ONLY REASON HE'S BROUGHT IT UP I'LL GIVE THE PAPER IS THAT THE POLES ARE NECK AND NECK AND THE PANIC BUTTON HAS BEEN
THE FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTS THAT THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE BELIEVES THAT BRECHT SAID COULD LEAD TO THE LOSS OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IT SAYS HE'S WARNING CAME AS IT EMERGED THAT SEVERAL INVESTMENT BANKS OR DISCUSS CLAUSES IN LOAN DOCUMENTS TO ALLOW THEM TO INCREASE INTEREST RATE IF THERE'S A VOTE TO LEAVE THE MALE THINKS THE DEVELOPMENT PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF PRO BRUSSELS CAMPAIGNERS LED BY MISTER OSBORNE WHO HAVE WARNED THAT LOANS AND MORTGAGES COULD BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE IF BRITAIN GOES IT ALONE
THE MAIN STORY IN THE MAIL IS ABOUT A NEW STUDY WHICH HAS FOUND THAT MORE THAN THIRTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED NEEDLESSLY OVER TEN YEARS BECAUSE OF POOR CARE AFTER A HEART ATTACK RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT NINE OUT OF TEN PATIENTS DID NOT RECEIVE THE CORRECT TREATMENT INCLUDING SCANS DRUGS AND MEDICAL ADVICE THEY SAY THEIR FAILURE TO STICK TO INTERNATIONAL TREATMENT GUIDELINES CONTRIBUTES TO A QUARTER OF DEATHS FROM HEART ATTACKS
DAVID CAMERON IS DUE TO HOST AN INTERNATIONAL ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMIT IN LONDON ON THURSDAY BUT THE GUARDIAN PREDICTS KEY U.K. OVERSEAS TERRITORIES LED BY THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS WILL RESIST HIS CALLS TO MAKE FRESH CONCESSIONS ON ENDING TAX SECRECY THE FINANCIAL TIMES URGES MY CAMERA TO BE CAUTIOUS ARGUING THAT MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES BEING CONDUCTED IN BRITISH OFFSHORE CENTRES ARE LEGITIMATE WHAT'S NEEDED IT SUGGESTS HE'S A CONCERTED INTERNATIONAL EFFORT NOT OF PIECEMEAL WANT TO MAKE INROADS INTO RESTRICTING ILLICIT OFFSHORE FINANCE
AND THERE ARE MANY TRIBUTES TO THE AUSTRALIAN TELEVISION PRODUCER REG GRUNDY WHO CREATED THE SOAP OPERA NEIGHBOURS THE EXPRESS SAYS HE WAS KNOWN AS THE GODFATHER OF AUSTRALIAN TELEVISION THE TELEGRAPH TELLS HOW HE DEVELOPED GAME SHOWS SUCH AS WHEEL OF FORTUNE AND THEN EXPORTED THEM TO OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING BRITAIN THE TIMES AS MY GRAND IT WAS FIRM AND FAIR WITH HIS EMPLOYEES AND HIS POLICY WAS NOT TO KILL OFF CHARACTERS IN NEIGHBOURS THE ONE EXCEPTION WAS AN ACTOR WHO FELL OUT WITH HIM OVER
OUR MENUS THIS MORNING THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AS ACCUSE DAVID CAMERON OF GIVING GERMANY HAVE VETO OVER ONE OF BRITAIN'S KEY DEMANDS DURING THE E.U. REFERENDUM NEGOTIATIONS IT WAS A DAY OF BACKTRACKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY IN THE COMMONS LAST NIGHT A MINISTER CONFIRM TO BRITAIN WOULD TAKE LOAN SYRIAN CHILD REFUGEES FROM EUROPE ONE EARLY IN THE DAY THE EDUCATION SECRETARY SAID THE PLAN TO FORCE ALL STATE SCHOOLS TO BECOME ACADEMIES WAS BEING WITHDRAWN WATCHING IT ALL UNFOLD WAS A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN
IN POLITICS AS IN LIFE YOU TURNS THREE POINT TURNS OR ANY SORT OF REVERSAL IS SOMETHING WE'D ALL PREFER TO EXECUTE QUIETLY AND WITHOUT TOO MANY ONLOOKERS THE NEWS THAT THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN WAS DROPPING PLANS TO FORCE ALL STATE SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND TO BECOME ACADEMIES EMERGED ON FRIDAY WITH THE ROAR OF ELECTION RESULTS TRAFFIC VICKY MORGAN DID COME TO THE COMMONS TO ANNOUNCE THE CHANGE THOUGH IT SOUNDED AT FIRST AS IF SHE WAS STILL GOING IN EXACTLY THE DIRECTION SHE PLANNED
ACADEMIES ALL THE VEHICLE WHICH ALLOW SCHOOLS ARE LEADERS TO INNOVATE WITH THE CURRICULUM HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY SET THE PAY AND CONDITIONS FOR THEIR STAFF AND BRING ABOUT GREATER COLLABORATION WITH OTHER SCHOOLS WE STILL WANT EVERY SCHOOL TO BECOME AN ACADEMY BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO THERE WAS A BUT COMING
WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT A HARD DEADLINE LEGISLATING FOR BLANK PAST ISSUE ACADEMY ORDERS
THAT IS WHY WAS HE CRYING OUT OFF FRIDAY WE HAVE DECIDED IS NOT NECESSARY TO TAKE BLANKET POWERS TO CONVERT GOOD SCHOOLS IN STRONG LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ACADEMIES AT THIS TIME AS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO STAND AROUND SMIRKING AS YOU PERFORM THE TRICKY MANOEUVRE THOSE WHO TOOK TO THE AIRWAVES THIS WEEKEND TO CROW ABOUT A VICTORY IN THE BATTLE AGAINST RISING STANDARDS WILL FIND THEMSELVES SORELY DISAPPOINTED
SHE DIDN'T SAY WHO SHE MEANT BUT HER LABOUR'S SHADOW LUCY PILE WAS CERTAINLY PLEASED AT DEVELOPMENTS IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT DESPITE HER BEST EFFORTS THIS U. TURN IS GETTING THE AIRING IT DESERVES TO
AS FOR THE IDEA THERE WAS NO REAL CHANGE OF DIRECTION HOWEVER SHE WANTS TO DRESS IT UP DROPPING HER DESIRED TO FORCE ALL SCHOOLS TO BECOME ACADEMIES BY ARBITRARY DEADLINE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS A KEY CONCESSION
SCHOOL LEADERS SHOULD TAKE IT AS A VERY CLEAR SIGNAL BUT THE THOUGHT IS OFF THEIR THROAT AND THEY SHOULDN'T FEEL THEY NEED TO JUMP BEFORE BEING
NOW GRAHAM STEWART WAS ONE OF THE CONSERVATIVES WHO PUT PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE COURSE OVER FORCING SCHOOLS TO BECOME ACADEMIES HE BEGAN BY TAKING THE SECRETARY OF STATE ON HER STATEMENT AND FOR THE WAY SHE'S ENGAGED WITH
BUT JUST TO BE SURE DOES SHE AGREE THAT IF LOCAL AUTHORITIES DO
TO DELIVER OUTSTANDING SCORES AN EXCELLENT OVERVIEW AND INTERVENTION BUT THEY CAN CONTINUE THE ANSWER WAS YES OF COURSE
IF IT WERE CHARGED IN A GOOD SCHOOL ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY STRONG LOCAL AUTHORITY THE FACT I WANT TO GET ON WITH DOING THAT LOTS OF CONSERVATIVE M.P.S THANK NICKY MORGAN FOR HER CHANGE OF MIND NONE LESS SO THAN STEVE BRIAN WHO HAD BEEN SAVED FROM A RATHER TORRID TIME IN HIS CONSTITUENCY BY THE NEWS
I HAPPENED TO BE IN A MEETING AND SHE COUNTY ACCOUNTS WITH THE LEADER IN THE SCHOOL'S LEGAL FRIDAY AFTERNOON I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE FIRST HALF OF THE MEETING DIDN'T GO AS WELL AS THE SECOND
I HEARD HER ANNOUNCEMENT OH CASTLE NO
MICKEY MORGAN SAID IT WASN'T PRECISELY HE'S MEETING WHICH HAD SET THE TIMING OF HER ANNOUNCEMENT ON FRIDAY THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO FOUND ITSELF FORCED INTO A CHANGE OF MIND ON ANOTHER FRONT THE RESETTLEMENT IN THE U.K. OF MIGRANT CHILDREN FROM EUROPE THE HOUSE OF LORDS HAS REPEATEDLY INSISTED THE U.K. SHOULD TAKE SOME OF THE CHILDREN AND TO STAVE OFF THE PROSPECT OF A DEFEAT IN THE COMMONS TO MINISTERS HAVE GIVEN IN LATE LAST NIGHT THE HOME OFFICE MINISTER JAMES BROKEN SHIRE MEDITATIVE OFFICIAL
ACCEPTING THIS A MOMENT DEMONSTRATES THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO DO MORE FOR REFUGEE CHILDREN ACROSS THE GLOBE WHAT'S UP UPHOLDING THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE ENCOURAGING VULNERABLE PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT
WE REMAIN OF THE VIEW THAT WE CAN HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT BY SUPPORTING REFUGEES AND AFFECTED REGIONS AND THE COUNTRIES HOSTING THEM THOSE WE RESETTLE HERE ARE THE EXCEPTIONS ARE CONSERVATIVE SIR GERALD HOWARTH STILL DIDN'T SEE BY THE U.K. SHOULD TAKE ON CHILDREN WHO'D ALREADY ESCAPED DANGER
THESE CHILDREN ARE ALREADY IN SAFE COUNTRIES WAS THE MINISTER OF THOSE
WHO SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT SUGGESTING THAT SOMEHOW FRANCE AND GERMANY AGREE SIR NOT SAFE COUNTRIES THE MINISTER SAID THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISED THE PRESSURE'S ON COUNTRIES SUCH AS GREECE IN THE LORDS LABOUR'S LORD DUBS WHO'D HEADED THE CAMPAIGN HAD CALLED FOR A THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE U.K. LABOUR STEPHEN DOUGHTY WONDERED WHETHER THAT WAS STILL POSSIBLE
IS HE GOING TO ACT WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF THIS FIGURE OF THREE THOUSAND PERHAPS CAN GIVE US ANY INDICATION ON THE SHORTS AND PERHAPS BEFORE THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR STARTS HOW MANY ROUGHLY IS HE LOOKING THAT WE WILL SUPPORT THE MINISTER EXPLAINED THAT AN ARBITRARY FIGURE WASN'T RIGHT HARD PRESSED LOCAL AUTHORITIES NEEDED TO BE CONSULTED AND IN THE END THE COMMONS AGREED TO THE GOVERNMENT'S CHANGE OF HEART ON UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN MINISTERS WILL HOPE THAT IT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THEY FINALLY MANAGED TO PART
REPORTING ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT MORE AS USUAL AT HALF PAST EIGHT ON DIGITAL AND LONG WAVE NOW AT THIRTY MINUTES TO SEVEN FOR THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF REPORTS ON THE ROAD AHEAD OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM WE ARE IN THE NORTH EAST THIS MORNING IN THE SEASIDE TOWN OF WHITBY WHERE MANY BLAME THE E.U. FOR THE DEMISE OF THEIR FISHING INDUSTRY AND OUR ZOE CONWAY'S THERE GOOD MORNING ZOE
GOOD MORNING SARAH I'M LOOKING OUT AT STUNNING WHITBY HARBOUR IT REALLY IS BEAUTIFUL WITH THE REFLECTIONS OF THE BOATS IN THE WATER BUT WHAT'S STRIKING LOOKING OUT AS IT IS HOW DIFFERENT IT LOOKS TODAY TO HOW IT WOULD'VE LOOKED A FEW DECADES AGO I'M TOLD THAT IN THE MORNINGS I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MANY TRAWLERS HERE THAT YOU COULD STEP FROM ONE SIDE OF THE HARBOUR TO THE OTHER BY STEPPING ACROSS THEM
BUT TODAY THERE'S ONLY ONE WHITE FISH TRAWLER LEFT AND THAT'S OWNED BY RICHARD BREWER AND HE'S WITH ME NOW AND RICHARD A LOCAL FISHERMAN SAID TO ME THAT THERE'S SO LITTLE FISHING GOING ON AND WHITBY NOW THAT IT'S LIKE A MUSEUM I MEAN WHO DO YOU BLAME FOR THAT
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S A SAD FACT THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW FISHING VESSELS LEFT WORKING FROM WHITBY THE MEN BLAME IN MY OPINION POSSIBLY PUT HER FIRMLY AT THE DOOR OF THE
IT WAS CALLED THE COMMON MARKET A MARKET PLACE SHE ISN'T ANY MORE I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE OVER MORE AND MORE OF OUR SEVENTEEN WERE WHILE OUR INDUSTRY
HOW CAN YOU BLAME THE E.U. FOR THE LACK OF HERRING IN THE SEA THAT'S NOT A RESULT OF AN E.U. DIRECTIVE AND IF YOU WANT TO FISH FOR WHITE FISH THAT YOU NEED TO GO UP TO SCOTLAND TO PETERHEAD THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY'S TO BE MADE ISN'T IT THAT'S WHAT THE FAULT IS IT
WELL AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A LOT MORE FISH IN THE NORTHERN WATERS BUT DOWN HERE WITH THE DECLINE IN THE EUROPEAN FLEETS WHEN THE FRIDGE WITH THE COMMISSION IN THE THE EIGHTIES IN THE NINETIES THERE IS VERY LITTLE EFFORT IN THE NORTH SEA THAT'S ALL MEMBER STATES NOT JUST
WHITBY HAS DECLINED AND SCARBOROUGH DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS AND THAT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A VERY VERY LESS FISHING OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE A VERY SMALL QUARTERS AT THE MOMENT WHICH WE TRIED TO INCREASE AND ALSO WORKING ALONGSIDE THAT WE HAVE ARE A DESERT SEA REGIME WHICH ONLY GIVES US SO MANY DAYS PER YEAR TO WORK I WOULD FIND THAT VERY VERY HARD TO KEEP THE VESSEL AS PROFITABLE
BUT THERE WOULD STILL HAVE TO BE A QUOTA SYSTEM EVEN IF WE CAME OUT OF THE E.U. YOU WOULDN'T THERE I MEAN YOU'D HAVE TO NEGOTIATE SHELLFISH HERE FOR EXAMPLE ARE SOLD TO FRANCE AND SPAIN THAT HAVE TO BE A SYSTEM TO GO SHH OCEAN AROUND A QUOTA EVEN THE U.K. GOVERNMENT WOULD NEED A QUOTA SYSTEM FOR CONSERVATION REASONS
TOTALLY I MEAN CONSERVATION IS WHAT FISHERMEN RULE WITHOUT YOU YOUR MOST HOW IT MUST BE CONSERVE HOOTER GENERATIONS I HAVE MY SONS FOLLOW ME IN THE INDUSTRY AND WE'RE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BEHIND THAT
BUT WITH A MODERN SIZES WE CAN USE THESE DAYS SURELY THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY RATHER THAN PUT PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS THERE SHOULD BE A BETTER WAY OF CONSERVING THE STOCKS BUT IN THE STOCKS RECOVER TO ER SUSTAINABLE LEVEL BUT STILL STILL KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE COMING INTO THE FISHING INDUSTRY
MOST PRIZED FACING THAT RICHARD IS GOING TO BE VOTING OUT I'LL BE BACK IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WHERE I'LL BE GETTING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE UP AND SPEAKING TO ONE OF THE SHIPBUILDERS HERE IN WHITBY WHO IS CONCERNED THAT THE IF THAT BREAKS IT COULD AFFECT HER BUSINESS DEALS WITH THE REST OF EUROPE BACK BACK TO YOU SARAH THANKS VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS TEN TO SEVEN AS TEN AND ELEVEN YEAR OLDS IN ENGLAND SET THEIR SPELLING PUNCTUATION AND GRAMMAR TEST TODAY THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION IS AGAIN UNDER FIRE BECAUSE IT IS EMERGED THAT THIS TEST APPEARED ONLINE AHEAD OF TIME LAST MONTH THE TEST FOR SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS HAD TO BE SCRAPPED AFTER IT EMERGED IT HAD BEEN POSTED ONLINE WE'RE JOINED BY ROBERT PIGGOTT OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME ROBERT
YES THIS TIME THE PEARSON THE COMPANY WHO SUPPLY THE EXAMS ARE POSTED THE PAPER ON THEIR SITE FOR A SHORT PERIOD TO A TALK BY THE GOVERNMENT
AND IT WAS TAKEN DOWN LAST NIGHT BUT NOT BEFORE IT HAD BEEN SEEN BY MARCO CAESAR SEVERAL DOZEN PEOPLE I UNDERSTAND IN THE COUNTRY THEY CAN INCLUDE PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO ALSO ADMINISTERING THE TEST AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE SECURITY BREACH REALLY COMES
THEY WOULD NORMALLY GO TO THE THE TEAM LEADERS FOR MARCUS BUT NOT TO ALL THE MARKERS THEMSELVES AND IT DID REPRESENT QUITE A SERIOUS BRIDGE AND OF COURSE IT'S HUGELY EMBARRASSING FOR THE GOVERNMENT COMING ON TOP OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS YOU MENTIONED WELL EXACTLY I MEAN THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION SAYING THAT THAT IT WAS PEARSON RESPONSIBLE RATHER THAN THEM BUT WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE THEM GIVEN THAT IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS THAT IT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A VERY CONTROVERSIAL TEST PARENTS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT IT MAKES CHILDREN STRESSED AND ANXIOUS THAT IT DISTORTING THE CURRICULUM AS TEACHERS FOCUS ON THE ACTUAL TEST QUESTIONS AND OF COURSE WE HAD THE BOYCOTT BY WHAT'S THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF PUPILS LAST WEEK SO COMING ON TOP OF ALL THAT CONTROVERSY IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE UM IT'S PARTLY ABOUT APPEARANCE IN THIS REALLY DOESN'T LOOK GOOD THE D. F. HE MUST HAVE BEEN HOPING THAT THESE TESTS WOULD AT LEAST GO OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT AND NOW WE'VE GOT THIS HAPPENING AS WELL
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THESE MARKERS ARE ANDRE AND A STRICT CONTRACT THEY HAVE TO GO ONTO THIS SECURE SITE WITH A PASSWORD AND SOMEONE HAS BROKEN THAT BREACH THEIR CONTRACT BY BY LEAKING IT OUT BUT OF COURSE IT DOES COME OFF TO THE FACT TO TEST FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS THE BASELINE TESTS WERE SUSPENDED EARLIER IN THE YEAR AFTER THREE TESTS WERE FOUND NOT TO BE COMPARABLE WE HAVE THE THE SPELLING AND GRAMMAR TEST FOR SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS AS YOU SAID AND NOW THIS ALL ON TOP OF THE ACADEMY'S KLIMT
AND HE REALLY IS A VERY AWKWARD TIME FOR FOR NICKY MORGAN AND THE DEPARTMENT AND IT MEANS THAT PARENTS WERE HEARING ABOUT THIS AND HIS CHILDREN ARE OF A SITTING THIS TEST TODAY HAVE A MEMBER MIGHT WELL BE ANGRY ALREADY ABOUT IT AND THEN THERE'S A SENSE THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT AHEAD OF TIME YES I MEAN THERE IS A SENSE THAT THE TEST HAS BEEN COMPROMISED DON'T AND IT UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE AS LABOUR ARE POINTING OUT PARENTS AND TEACHERS CONFIDENCE IN THE PRIMARY ASSESSMENT SYSTEM AND I THINK THERE IS A CASE TO BE MADE THERE AND CERTAINLY EAT CHILDREN
YOU'D HAVE SEEN THIS COULD HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT ISN'T IT ONLY REALLY TAKES THAT IN THERE COME AT CURRENT CLIMATE LET'S NOT FORGET TO THAT SCHOOLS ARE JUDGED ON THESE RESULTS TO SOW THIS ONE MATTERS IN THE SENSE EVEN MORE THAN THE ONE WITH THE SPELLING AND GRAMMAR TEST FOR SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS THAT WAS POSTED ONLINE WITH PRACTICE MATERIALS IN JANUARY AND HAD TO BE SCRAPPED IT MATTERS EVEN MORE
THAT ONE WAS GOING TO BE FED OUT OVER THIS COMING MONTH ONE OF OUR TOP BASIS BY SCHOOLS THIS ONE IS SAT LIKE A GHQ ON A PARTICULAR DAY AT A PARTICULAR TIME AND THE RESULTS GO OFF TO CENTRAL MARKING AND THEN THE THE RESULTS MATTER IN THIS WAY SO YES IT IS IT IS A BIG BLOW EVEN IF IT'S PEARSON WHO ACTUALLY LET THIS GO UP ONTO THE SITE ROBERT THANK YOU WERE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY CHRISTINE BLOWER GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING TO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS
WELL THE FACT IS THAT WE WROTE TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE AT THE END OF LAST MONTH ON THE TWENTY NINTH APRIL TO SAY THAT THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN IT'S IN CHAOS THEY SHOULD JUST SCRAP THE TESTS FOR THIS YEAR AND START AGAIN BY TALKING WITH THE PROFESSION ABOUT WHAT A PROPER SYSTEM OF ASSESSMENT FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN WOULD LOOK LIKE
AND FRANKLY THE NEWS TODAY THAT NOW THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE KEY STAGE TWO SPELLING PUNCTUATION GRAMMAR TEST REINFORCES THAT VIEW WE ALSO KNOW TODAY THAT THERE ARE THERE'S A COMRADES SURVEY TO SHOW THAT CHILDREN FEEL UNDER MASSIVE PRESSURE ABOUT DOING THESE TESTS AND IN IN HIS REPORT ROBERT PICK IT MADE ALL OF THE POINTS THAT I WOULD HAVE MADE THE FACT IS THAT THEY ARE VERY HIGH STAKES
AND THEY ARE THE WRONG TESTS AT THE WRONG TIME AND NOW THEY'RE COMPANY SO YOU WERE ALREADY PRETTY ANGRY ABOUT ALL OF THIS DO YOU DO YOU TAKE THE POINT FROM THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION THAT THIS IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST TIME WHERE IT WAS OR A PARENT TO WHO SAW THIS ON THEIR WEBSITE AND AND BROUGHT IT TO TO WIDER ATTENTION THIS TIME THIS WAS A SECURE SITE AT THIS TEST APPEARED ON AND SOMEONE WHO HAD ACCESS TO THAT SITE
BREACHED THAT THE CONFIDENCE PLACED IN THEM WELL THE FACT IS THAT HOWEVER THIS HAPPENED AND OBVIOUSLY I ONLY KNOW WHAT I'M HEARING THIS MORNING HOWEVER IT HAPPENED IT HAS COMPROMISED THE TESTS WE DIDN'T LIKE THE TEST IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THE FACT IS THE TESTS ARE COMPROMISED AND IT JUST ADDS TO THE GENERAL SENSE OF CHAOS ABOUT NOT JUST THE CURRICULUM BUT IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT THIS YEAR
AND SO WE WE WERE WE REPEAT THAT WE THINK THAT FOR THIS YEAR THE RESULTS OF THESE TESTS SHOULD BE SCRAPPED AND NOT USED FOR ANY PURPOSE WHATSOEVER AND IF THEY'RE NOT WHAT WHAT SHOULD WHAT SHOULD PARENTS IN SOME SOME PARENTS OBVIOUSLY SENDING THEIR CHILDREN OFF TO DO THESE TESTS TODAY YES AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING I SAW ONLINE OVER THE WEEKEND FROM FROM A TEACHER SAYING THAT THE WAY TO SPEND THE WEEKEND BEFORE YOU'RE DOING THESE TESTS IS ACTUALLY TO GO FOR A WALK RIDE YOUR BIKE READ A BOOK NOT WORRY ABOUT THEM THAT'S THE BEST ADVICE TO PARENTS THIS MORNING
DON'T SEND YOUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL WORRIED ABOUT THESE TESTS AND FRANKLY PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT ALONG WITH US TO SAY THAT NO RESULTS OF THESE TESTS SHOULD BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE IT'S DEEPLY REGRETTABLE THAT CHILDREN WILL BE PUT THROUGH THEM WHEN FRANKLY THEY ARE COMPROMISE WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON THE IDEA OF BOYCOTTING THEM
WELL THE THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS TO GIVE YOU THIS YEAR THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO SAY TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT THESE TESTS SHOULDN'T OCCUR THIS YEAR AND THE WRITING TEST HAPPENED LAST HAPPENED YESTERDAY AND THERE'S PLENTY OF MATERIAL AROUND TO SAY THAT THERE WAS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THE WRITING TEST THIS THE SPELLING PUNCTUATION GRAMMAR TEST IS COMPROMISE NOT BY THE NATIONAL TEACHERS DOING ANYTHING BUT BY OTHER THINGS HAPPENING SO EVENTUALLY IF WE CAN'T MAKE ANY PROGRESS WE WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER
WHETHER WE SHOULD BOYCOTT THEM BUT YOU'RE NOT AT THAT POSITION YET ON THE BASIS OF THIS NO BUT WE ARE SAYING TO GOVERNMENT IF THESE TESTS A COMPROMISE YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY USE THE RESULTS FOR ANY PURPOSE

THE FARMER WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS CLAIMED THAT GERMANY FORCED DAVID CAMERON TO ABANDON ONE OF THE KEY DEMANDS HE WAS PLANNING IN HIS Y. Y. YOU RE NEGOTIATIONS LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THEY WERE UNVEILED MY DUNCAN SMITH WHO QUIT THE CABINET IN MARCH HAS TOLD THE SUN THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WANTED AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON E.U. MIGRATION TO THE U.K. BUT AGREED TO DROP THE DEMAND BECAUSE OF PROTESTS FROM BERLIN
HE SUGGESTS THE WHOLE SPEECH MISTER CAMERON DELIVERED SETTING OUT BRITAIN'S DEMANDS IN NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS SHOWN TO THE GERMANS BEFOREHAND FOR APPROVAL DOWNING STREET SAYS MISTER CAMERON HAD HIMSELF DECIDED A DIFFERENT WAY OF DEALING WITH THE ISSUE WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IS OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CAROLE WALKER
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS LAUNCHED A STINGING ATTACK ON WHAT HE SAID WAS DAVID CAMERON'S FAILURE IN THE RENEGOTIATION OF BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. HE TOLD THE SUN THAT AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON E.U. MIGRATION WAS IN MISTER CAMERON'S DRAFT SPEECH UNTIL THE MIDNIGHT HOUR BUT IT WAS DROPPED BECAUSE OF A DE FACTO VETO BY THE GERMANS
HE ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER A PUTTING BRITAIN IN A COMPLIANT POSITION TO ANOTHER COUNTRY WHICH DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE OUR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART AND SAID THE U.K. WAS IN A WORSE POSITION THAN BEFORE THE RENEGOTIATION
THE FINAL DEAL INCLUDED AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON BENEFITS NOT ON MIGRATION ALLOWING THE GOVERNMENT TO RESTRICT MIGRANTS IN WORK BENEFITS FOR FOUR YEARS WHEN THERE ARE EXCEPTIONAL LEVELS OF MIGRATION A DOWNING STREET SPOKESMAN SAID THE PRIME MINISTER MADE CLEAR AT THE TIME THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD DECIDED AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON MIGRATION WAS NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY FORWARD AND DECIDED TO RESTRICT BENEFITS INSTEAD TO END THE SOMETHING FOR NOTHING CULTURE
SENIOR FIGURES FROM EVERY QUITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HAVE WARNED THAT BRITAIN WILL LOSE INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD IF IT LEAVES THE Y. YOU THIRTEEN AMERICAN POLITICIANS INCLUDING THE FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY LEON PERN ETTA AND THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT HAVE TOLD THE TIMES THAT THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH WASHINGTON WOULD NOT COMPENSATE THE U.K. FOR A DIMINISHED GLOBAL ROLE
FIVE FORMER SECRETARIES GENERAL OF NATO HAVE ALSO VOICED CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECT BRECK'S AT MIGHT HAVE ON SECURITY THEY SAID A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD UNDERMINE THE ALLIANCE AND GIVE SUCCOUR TO THE WEST'S ENEMIES BUT THE FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY AND LEAVE CAMPAIGNER LIAM FOX TOLD NEWSNIGHT THAT THE WARNINGS WERE OUT OF DATE
A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE FROM VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE THAT WE ARE IN NOW AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEN BUT I THINK WE'RE ENTERING INTO A VERY DIFFERENT PERIOD IN TERMS OF GLOBAL SECURITY STRUCTURES I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM OUTSIDE
THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD ACTUALLY GIVEN IMPETUS TO THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF NATO WHICH I THINK HAVE BEEN LONG NEGLECTED
THERE'S BEEN A NARROWING OF THE GAP IN THE E.U. DEBATE AMONG BUSINESS LEADERS IN ITS FINAL PAUL BEFORE THE REFERENDUM THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE FOUND SUPPORT FOR STAYING IN HAD DROPPED FROM SIXTY PERCENT TO FIFTY FOUR POINT FIFTY FOUR POT PERCENT SINCE FEBRUARY THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BUSINESS PEOPLE SURVEYED WISHING TO LEAVE HAS RISEN FROM THIRTY TO THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S AS IRISH THE GOVERNMENT TO CLARIFY THE LEGAL CASE FOR THE USE OF AIR STRIKES BY UNMANNED DRONES AGAINST SUSPECTED TERRORISTS THE CALL FROM THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS FOLLOWS THE KILLING IN SYRIA LAST YEAR OF A BRITISH CITIZEN BY AN R.A.F. DRONE THE GOVERNMENT INSISTED SUCH ACTIONS WOULD BE TAKEN ONLY WHEN THEY COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW HERE'S OUR SECURITY CORRESPONDENT GORDON CAREER
THE COMMITTEE SAYS THERE WERE CONTRADICTIONS AND INCONSISTENCIES IN THE GOVERNMENT'S EXPLANATION OF ITS POLICY ON DRONE STRIKES IN THE WAKE OF THE KILLING OF RAHART KHAN THE BRITISH MILITARY HAD NOT BEEN AUTHORISED BY PARLIAMENT TO ENGAGE A MILITARY ACTION INSIDE SYRIA AT THAT STAGE AND THE STRIKE WAS JUSTIFIED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ARMED CONFLICT IN IRAQ
THE COMMITTEE SAYS IT'S ESTABLISHED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE A POLICY TO USE LETHAL FORCE ABROAD AS A LAST RESORT AGAINST THOSE SUSPECTED OF PLANNING ATTACKS EVEN IF OUTSIDE AN ARMED CONFLICT
THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THIS REQUIRES URGENT CLARIFICATION THE COMMITTEE ARGUES ESPECIALLY OVER WHAT CONSTITUTES AN IMMINENT THREAT AND WHEN IT COMES TO ACCOUNTABILITY AFTER A STRIKE
THE U.S. MILITARY SAYS IT'S KILLED A SENIOR LEADER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN IRAQ A PENTAGON SPOKESMAN SAID ABU WAHID DIED IN ANBAR PROVINCE ALONG WITH THREE OTHERS LAST FRIDAY IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER A WAR PLANE OR A DRONE WAS INVOLVED
OR GRAMMAR PUNCTUATION AND SPELLING TESTS DUE TO BE TAKEN BY ALL TEN AND ELEVEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN IN ENGLAND THIS MORNING HAS BEEN ACCIDENTALLY POSTED ONLINE IT'S THE SECOND TIME IN THREE WEEKS THAT ONE OF THE CONTROVERSIAL SATS HAS BEEN PUBLISHED EARLY BY MISTAKE LABOUR SAYS CONFIDENCE IN THE TEST HAS BEEN UNDERMINED AND HAS CALLED FOR AN EMERGENCY REVIEW HERE'S OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
LAST MONTH THE SPELLING AND GRAMMAR TEST FOR SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN HAD TO BE ABANDONED AFTER THE PAPER WAS POSTED WITH PRACTICE MATERIALS THREE MONTHS EARLY THIS TIME TO SPELLING AND GRAMMAR PAPER FOR SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND TEN AND ELEVEN YEAR OLD PUPILS WAS PUBLISHED BY PEARSON THE COMPANY SUPPLYING THE TESTS
THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION SPOKESMAN SAID THE PAPER ACCIDENTALLY APPEARED FOR A SHORT TIME ON A SITE ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO REGISTERED MARKERS VIA A PASSWORD HE SAID A MARKER HAD BEEN GUILTY OF A BREACH OF CONTRACT IN SHARING THE INFORMATION AND AN INVESTIGATION WAS UNDERWAY
THIS YEAR'S MORE CHALLENGING SATS HAVE BEEN CONTROVERSIAL WITH PARENTS CLAIMING THEY MAKE CHILDREN STRESSED AND ANXIOUS AT THE LATEST MISTAKE IN ADMINISTERING THEM WILL BE ACUTELY EMBARRASSING FOR MINISTERS
OFFICIALS IN CANADA HAVE HAD THEIR FIRST LOOK AT A CITY THAT'S BEEN BADLY DAMAGED BY HUGE WILDFIRE NEARLY NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE FLED THEIR HOMES AND FORT MCMURRAY LAST WEEK THOUSANDS OF HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BUT THE PREMIER OF THE PROVINCE SAID NEARLY NINETY PER CENT OF BUILDINGS HAD SURVIVED A CORRESPONDENT LAURA BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST JOURNALISTS ARE ALLOWED INTO THE EVACUATIONS
THE FIRE HAS BEEN BRUTAL FAMILY NEIGHBOURHOODS HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A MASS OF MELTED METAL AND BLACKENED CONCRETE ONLY THE FOUNDATIONS REMAIN EVERYTHING THAT MADE THESE HOSES ARE HOME HAS GONE
IT'S CLEAR THE BLAZE HAS BEEN UNPREDICTABLE IN SOME PARTS AN ENTIRE STREET HAS BEEN DESTROYED AND THE NEXT IS UNTOUCHED THE MEAN BUILDINGS IN FORT MCMURRAY HAVE NOT BEEN HARMED THE HOSPITAL THEY'RE NEARLY ALL OF THE SCHOOLS ESCAPED DESTRUCTION BUT THE CITY IS STILL NOT SAFE THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHICH ARE STILL SMOULDERING AND THERE'S NO POWER WATER OR GAS OFFICIALS ARE WARNING THAT IT WILL BE AT LEAST TWO WEEKS BEFORE THERE'S A PLAN IN PLACE FOR RESIDENTS TO RETURN
A B.B.C. INVESTIGATION HAS FOUND THAT MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MIGRANTS WHO DIED TRYING TO CROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN HAD BEEN BURIED IN UNMARKED GRAVES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AT LEAST SEVENTY BURIAL SITES WERE IDENTIFIED IN TURKEY GREECE AND ITALY THE AUTHORITIES SAY THEY ARE OVERWHELMED AND LACK THE RESOURCES TO PROPERLY DETERMINE WHO HAS DIED OR TO LOCATE THE ROOM THEIR RELATIVES
A MAN IN HIS FIFTIES HAS BEEN SHOT DEAD IN WEST BELFAST IT'S UNDERSTOOD HE WORKED AS A DELIVERY DRIVER IT'S THE THIRD SHOOTING IN THE CITY WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
SCIENTISTS AT THE ROYAL BOTANIC GARDENS IN KEW HAVE PUBLISHED WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS THE FIRST GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF THE WORLD'S PLANTS THE RESEARCH PROVIDES A NEW TALLY FOR THE NUMBER OF SPECIES KNOWN TO SCIENCE AND CARRIES A WARNING THAT A FIFTH OF ALL PLANTS ARE AT RISK OF EXTINCTION IS OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT REBECCA
THIS NEW STOCKTAKE SUGGEST THERE ARE NOW THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE THOUSAND PLANTS KNOWN TO SCIENCE BUT THE RESEARCHERS AT KEW GARDENS SAY THIS MAY BE A FRACTION OF WHAT'S THERE LAST YEAR ALONE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND NEW SPECIES WERE DISCOVERED THEY INCLUDE A GIANT TREE THAT STANDS NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET TALL ARE FOUND IN THE FORESTS OF GOT BORN IN WEST AFRICA FIVE NEW SPECIES OF ONION AND A SPRAWLING INSECT EATING PLANT DISCOVERED IN BRAZIL
BUT THE REPORT WARNS THAT ONE IN FIVE OF ALL PLANT SPECIES IS UNDER THREAT VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE HABITAT LOSS OR DISEASE THE SCIENTISTS ALSO SAY THERE ARE NOW FIVE THOUSAND INVASIVE SPECIES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING PLANTS LIKE JAPANESE KNOTWEED THAT'S A PUTTING NATIVE FLORA AT RISK
REBECCA MORALE REPORTING THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IN AUGUST LAST YEAR AND R.A.F. DRONE TARGETED AND KILLED RIYADH KHAN A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD FROM CARDIFF WHO HAD TRAVELLED TO SYRIA TO JOIN SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
THE PRIME MINISTER SAID LATER THAT HE HAD BEEN PLOTTING BARBARIC ATTACKS ON BRITISH SOIL BUT A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE IS NOW CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CLARIFY ITS POSITION ON DRONE STRIKES OUTSIDE OF ARMED CONFLICT THE LABOUR M.P. HARRIET HARMAN WHO CHAIRS THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS IS WITH US GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND WHY IS THE POSITION NOT CLEAR
WELL BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT ARE NOT CERTAIN OF THE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH THEY'RE DOING THIS THEY'RE BOTH CONFUSED AND CONFUSING I THINK NO ONE WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO BE STANDING AROUND FEELING THAT THEY CAN'T TAKE ACTION WHEN A TERRORIST IS OPERATING ABROAD AND THREATENING TO KILL US BUT NOR DO WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO BE TRIGGER HAPPY AND I THINK THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO ENSURE
WE'VE GOT A CLEAR LEGAL FRAMEWORK WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS OPERATING ON AND THAT THIS INDEPENDENT SCRUTINY AFTERWARDS AND NEITHER OF THOSE IS HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IN OUR REPORT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IS THAT THE MILITARY ACTION THAT KILLED OUR KIND WAS ARMED CONFLICT BECAUSE OF THE U.K. WAS ALREADY INVOLVED IN THE CONFLICT IN IRAQ AND THIS WAS THE ACTION AND SO HE WAS AN EXTENSION OF THAT IS THAT IS THAT NOT CLEAR
WE SAY IN A REPORT THAT WE BELIEVE ULTIMATELY THAT THAT IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS SAYING BUT IT'S NOT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING TO BEGIN WITH THEY WERE SAYING DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THEN THEIR PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE SAID SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO THE UN WAS IT SELF DEFENCE OR WAS IT AN EXTENSION OF WHAT WE'D BEEN DOING IN IRAQ AND THE POINT IS YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING AND THEN DECIDE WHAT YOUR JUSTIFICATION IS AFTERWARDS YOU HAVE TO DECIDE IN ADVANCE WHAT YOUR JUSTIFICATION IS AND WHAT THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IT'S AND
THEY THEY HADN'T SO WE'RE SAYING THAT WE ACCEPT THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THE AUTHORISATION OF THE USE OF FORCE IN IRAQ THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO TAKE THAT ACTION IN SYRIA AGAINST TO READ KHAN THEY'VE ALSO SAID THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO DO DRONE STRIKES TO TARGET AND KILL INDIVIDUALS
OUTSIDE OF ZONES WHERE WE'RE IN ARMED CONFLICT FOR EXAMPLE LIKE IN YEMEN OR IN SOMALIA OR IN LIBYA AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A PROPER LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THAT AND ALSO INDEPENDENT SCRUTINY AFTERWARDS BUT YOU'VE GOT DO YOU DO YOU
SAVE THAT FOR ACTING PRE EMPTIED LEON ON THE ON THE BASIS OF INTELLIGENCE THAT SOMEONE MIGHT BE ABLE MIGHT BE ABOUT TO PLOT IN A TACKLE CARRY OUT AN ATTACK ON BRITISH SOIL IS NOT ENOUGH OF A LEGAL BASIS NO IT IS A LEGAL BASIS JUST NOT CLEAR IT HAS TO BE CLEAR WHAT THE THRESHOLDS THAT THEY ARE AND ONE OF THE THINGS IT IN ORDER TO MAKE IT LAWFUL IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY OUTSIDE AN AREA OF ARMED CONFLICT
EVERYBODY'S CLEAR ABOUT THE LAWS OF WAR AND THEY THEY PROVIDE THE STANDARDS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU'RE IN A WAR SITUATION BUT WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF A WAR SITUATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL LAW REQUIRES AND INDEED OUR HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REQUIRES IS THAT THIS INDEPENDENT SCRUTINY AFTERWARDS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A POLICE OFFICER KILL SOMEBODY HERE ON THE STREETS OF LONDON
AUTOMATICALLY IT'S REFERRED TO THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION NOT BECAUSE THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT THEY'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG BUT BECAUSE IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE IF THE STATE TAKES HER LIFE AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE INDEPENDENT SCRUTINY AFTERWARDS AND HOW DO I LOOK IN A MOMENT THE PROBLEM IS THAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS SAID THEY'RE GOING TO BE TARGETING PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE'RE NOT IN ARMED CONFLICT
BUT THERE'S NO SCRUTINY INDEPENDENT OF THE M.O.D. AS TO WHETHER THE INTELLIGENCE WAS RIGHT WHETHER THE PERSON THEY KILLED WAS THE RIGHT PERSON AND WHETHER IT WAS JUSTIFIED BUT WE ARE IN AN AGE WHERE SO MUCH OF THE WAY WE CONDUCT WARFARE TO DEBBIE WARFARE IN COUNTER TERRORISM IS THE LINES ARE OFTEN SO BLURRED COMPARED TO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK HAS ESTABLISHED WHERE YOU HAD A QUICK CLEAR DIVIDE BETWEEN WARP WHICH HAPPENED ABROAD AGAINST ESTATE ON THE ONE HAND
OR CRIME AND TERRORISM THAT HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY ON THE OTHER AND ACTUALLY NEW TECHNOLOGY AND THE RISE OF A FORCE LIKE EYES'LL DIAS HAS ACTUALLY CHANGED THAT AND WE'RE SAYING THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE A LEAD IN THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE
AND IN THE UN TO REVIEW AND CLARIFY THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK SO THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK THE GOVERNMENT IS OPERATING UNDER IS ONE WHICH MATCHES TODAY'S CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY NEED TO DO THIS NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN AND SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW BUT IF IT'S NOT LAWFUL THEN SOMEBODY IN THE MILITARY WHO DOES ONE OF THESE TARGETED KILLINGS COULD BE EXPOSED TO A CHARGE OF MURDER
WON'T YOU WITH US UP I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR REACTION TO LAST WEEK'S LOCAL ELECTION RESULTS AND PARTICULARLY REALLY THAT THE LESSONS THAT YOU THINK LABOUR NEEDS TO DRAW OR SHOULD DRAW FROM SUCCESSES LIKE THE ELECTION OF SIDIQUE KHAN IN LONDON IN THE NEW BRISTOL
WELL I THINK THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE ELECTION OF SIDIQUE KHAN AND MARVELLOUS MARVIN RHYS IN BRISTOL AND ALL THE LABOUR COUNCILLORS WHO HELD THEIR SEATS BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL VERY CLEAR THAT ALTHOUGH WE ARE ONE POINT AHEAD OF THE TORIES IN THE SHARE OF THE VOTE IN THE ELECTIONS COMPARED TO WE WERE SEVEN POINTS BEHIND LAST YEAR IN THE GENERAL ELECTION THAT IS NOT NEARLY GOOD ENOUGH AND ONE OF THE THINGS SIDIQUE KHAN HAS BEEN SAYING IS HE WON BECAUSE HE REACHED OUT
BEYOND LABOUR'S CORE BASE AND IN BEING THE MAYOR OF LONDON HE'S GOING TO BE THE MAYOR FOR ALL LONDONERS NOT JUST LONGSTANDING LABOUR'S JEREMY DOBBER NEEDED TO DO TO SELL HIM WELL OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO BE DOING BETTER AND JEREMY CORBIN SAID THAT HIMSELF AT THE PEEL P. LAST NIGHT WE NEED TO BE DOING BETTER IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO GOVERNMENT AND ACTUALLY PUT OUR POLICIES INTO ACTION
HARRIET HARMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN THE ROYAL BOTANIC GARDENS IN KEW HAVE PUBLISHED A COMPLETE A. TO Z. OF EVERY PLANT IN THE WORLD HE SAYS THE FIRST TIME THAT'S HAPPENED ALL FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND SPECIES OF PLANT DOCUMENTED
IN ONE PLACE IT'S LED THEM TO SUGGEST THAT A FIFTH OF ALL PLANTS ARE THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION WILL PROFESSOR KATHY WILLIS IS DIRECTOR OF SCIENCE AT THE ROYAL BOTANIC GARDENS IN KEW AND ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS WHO COMPILE THE REPORT SHE'S IN OXFORD NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOW I SAID EVERY PLANT IN THE WORLD BUT PRESUMABLY THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE YET TO BE DISCOVERED HE HAS THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE COME ACROSS WE WANNA FIRST QUESTIONS THE ASKED IN THIS REPORT WAS SQUAT HOW MANY PLANT SPECIES ARE THERE
AND WE'VE COME ACROSS THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE THOUSAND FROM ALL THE VARIOUS DATABASES AND THE INTERNATIONAL PLANT NAMES INDEX BUT EVERY YEAR TWO THOUSAND USED PLANTS BECAUSE ON AVERAGE I HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE THE BEST DISCOVER NEW PLANTS ARE CHINA AUSTRALIA AND BRAZIL SO THERE'S THERE'S MANY MANY MORE PLANTS TO BE DISCOVERED AND WE JUST I THINK WE'RE JUST TOUCHING THE SURFACE HERE OH KAY SO EXCITEMENT ABOUT NEW PLANTS DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU RAISE INCOME IN THIS COMPILATION IS
HOW MANY SPECIES ARE IN DANGER OF DYING OUT FOREVER YEAH VERY VERY WORRYING I THINK A CALL FOR ACTION TO ALL OF US GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT PLANTS ARE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF HUMAN WELLBEING FROM FOOD FUEL MEDICINES AND ALSO CLIMATE REGULATION AND IF WE LOOK AT THE ACTUALLY WHAT IS CAUSING THE EXTINCTION THREAT OF THESE PLANTS RIGHT NOW THE PREDOMINANT EXTINCTION THREAT IS AGRICULTURE
AND ALSO LOGGING SO FOR EXAMPLE GLOBALLY TWO POINT THREE MILLION SQUARE KILOMETRES FOG OF FOREST HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THAT ANYBODY THINKING ABOUT THAT IT MUST HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT ON ALL WE ALWAYS DO AND IT WAS THROUGH LOSS OF REALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES
PRODUCE YOU SAY A CALL FOR ACTION FOR ALL OF US FOR MOST OF US WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN CONTRIBUTE ALL I THINK WE CAN CONTRIBUTE EVERYONE CAN CONTRIBUTE THROUGH FIRST OF ALL BEING JOINING IN WITH HELPING TO IDENTIFY AND IMPORTANT PLANT AREAS WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE U.K. WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE SUCH SHITE SITES ALONE AND THESE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY PLANT LIFE INTERNATIONAL
SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING WE CAN ALL DO BUT THEN ALSO BEING VERY PRAGMATIC AS A GLOBAL COMMUNITY ABOUT THOSE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO CAN WE NEED TO CONSERVE BECAUSE OF THE PLANTS THEY CONTAIN IN AFFECTS THE NATURAL CAPITAL THAT'S PROVIDED BY BIO DIVERSITY AND I THINK WE NEED TO VIEW THIS AS IMPORTANT AS THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND THAT ANY OTHER NATURAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE RIVERS THE GEOLOGY AND ONCE WE START TO DO THAT ALL OF US NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT LANDSCAPE PLANNING AND PROTECTING THOSE AREAS THAT CONTAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT PLANTS FOR US BIT FOOD
OR FUEL OR EVEN FOR CLIMATE REGULATION WE ALL TEND TO GET QUITE EXCITED ABOUT ANIMALS BECOMING EXTINCT PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO CARE SO MUCH ABOUT PLANTS I KNOW THIS IS A FAILING OF ALL OF US I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR BREAKFAST TABLE TO REALISE HOW MANY THINGS ON THE TABLE WILL BE PROVIDED BY PLANTS AND I THINK ONE OF THE PROMS OF PLANTS ARE NOT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING BIOLOGY THEY'RE NOT THE MOST ATTRACTIVE LOOKING THING MANY OF OUR CROP WILD RELATIVES FOR EXAMPLE OF REALLY WEEDY LOOKING EXAMPLES SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE CROP WILD RELATIVE OF THE BANANA IS A FIT IT'S THE SIZE OF A FINGER
AND IT'S FULL OF REALLY LARGE BLACK SEEDS IF YOU BITE INTO AND THEY BREAK YOUR TEETH SO UNDERSTANDABLY ONE WON'T GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO EITHER PICK THE THING OR CONSERVE IT SO WE NEED TO GET MUCH BETTER EXPLAINING IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF THESE PLANTS AND WHAT THEY PROVIDE FOR ALL OF US IN TERMS OF HUMAN WELLBEING AND OF COURSE Q. IS FAMOUSLY TRYING TO GET TOGETHER THIS SEED BANK OF EVERY NOTE IS THE SEEDS OF EVERY KNOWN PLANT THAT'S RIGHT WE'VE ALREADY GOT TWO BILLION SEEDS IN THERE
AND OUR AIM IS TO GET TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S FLORA BY TWENTY TWENTY BUT IT'S NOT JUST ANY WILD FLORA IT IS THINGS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT THINGS ARE DOING DANGER HAD THINGS AS HIGHLY VULNERABLE SO FOR EXAMPLE WE ALREADY HAVE IN THERE A NUMBER OF SPECIES THAT HAVE GONE EXTINCT IN THE WILD AND IT'S A LIVING SEED BANKS HER EVERY EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS WI THAT WEE GERMINATE THE SEED AND BUILD A BUILD UP FURTHER SEED AND THEN MOVE ON SO THAT EFFECTIVELY WE HAVE THE GENETIC RESOURCE TO REPLACE LOST POPULATIONS
PROFESSOR CATHY WILLIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN EASYJET'S JUST REPORTED A LOSS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR VICTORIA FRITZ HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THOSE RESULTS FOR US VICTORIA HEY IT'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU MICHELLE THAT'S RIGHT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT OF COURSE UNUSUAL FOR AIRLINES TO POST A LOSS OVER THE WINTER MONTHS AND FOR MOST OF THE PROPHET TO COME IN THE BUSY SUMMER SEASON PRE TAX PROFITS FEE EASYJET HAVE COME IN AT TWENTY FOUR MILLION POUNDS IN TERMS OF THE LOSS THAT DOES ACTUALLY COME
TO A PROFIT OF SEVEN MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO I'M JOINED NOW BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF EASYJET CAROLINE MCCALL FROM NUMEROUS OFFICES IN THE CITY GOOD MORNING TO YOU CAROLINE MORNING NOW WE'VE HAD A SPATE OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS WE'VE HAD ATTACKS AND STRIKES BY AIRPORT STAFF IN EUROPE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR HOW MUCH HAS THIS SET YOUR AIRLINE
WELL IT'S IT'S CLEARLY HAS BEEN A VERY DIFFERENT DIFFICULT EXCEL ENVIRONMENT BUT JUST TECHNICALLY ACTUALLY THE REASON FOR THE LOSSES FOREIGN EXCHANGE THAT SOFTENING OF THE POUND AGAINST THE EURO SO IF YOU TAKE THAT CONSTANT CURRENCY WE WOULD HAVE MADE A PROFIT OF FIVE MILLION WHICH IS NEARLY THE SAME AS LAST YEAR IT'S ACTUALLY AFFECT ON OUR NUMBERS IS FOREIGN EXCHANGE HOWEVER YOU'RE RIGHT AND WE HAD A VERY STRONG FIRST HALF DESPITE THE VERY CHALLENGING EVENTS STARTING AT SHARM EL SHEIKH WHICH
WE'RE ONE OF THE VERY FEW AIRLINES FLY TO AND THEN FOLLOWED OF COURSE BY THE VERY TRAGIC EVENTS IN PARIS THEN BRUSSELS SO THOSE DEFINITELY HAVE AN EFFECT ON CITY TO CITY FLYING AS PARIS AND BRUSSELS I MEAN AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE TO STIMULATE DEMAND AT THE RIGHT TIME
TO GET PASSENGERS BACK IN FLYING AND THAT DOES HAPPEN I MEAN ACTUALLY IT DOES TAKE WEEKS BUT ACTUALLY AFTER A FEW WEEKS PEOPLE WANT TO GET BACK TO NORMAL AND THEY START FLYING AGAIN
AS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DOING BEFORE BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN VERY CHALLENGING SO A VERY STRONG FIRST HALF BUT REVENUES THEY WERE SHY OF EXPECTATIONS AND YOUR PLANES ARE NOT FOLD THE LOAD FACTOR THE PERCENTAGE OF THE PLANE THAT IS OCCUPIED IS EIGHTY NINE PER CENT TO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RESPOND TO THAT CAPACITY NUMBER SHOULD BE BRINGING PRICES THAT'S NOT RIGHT ACTUALLY IT'S A LATE FACTOR IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT WAS LAST YEAR'S A LATE FRACTURES EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN PERCENT AND IT WAS EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN PERCENT LAST YEAR OUR REVENUE AS ART
MARGINALLY SO IT'S ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION NEARLY ONE SEVEN SEVENTH ONE SIR ACTUALLY OUR NUMBERS ARE NOT THAT SHY OF EXPECTATIONS WHAT WE HAVE SURPRISED THE CITY ABOUT A COST CONTROL SO WE ARE VERY ACTIVELY MANAGED A COST BASE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT IN LIGHT OF THE MUCH MORE UNPREDICTABLE REVENUE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE OF EXTERNAL EVENTS AND ACTUALLY I THINK THAT'S GONE DOWN VERY WELL SO FAR
BECAUSE OUR COSTS PER SEAT IS DOWN YEAR ON YEAR AND AND THAT'S GOOD WITH AND WE'VE SAID IT THAT IT WILL BE FLAT AND DOWN FOR THE AIR AS CAROLINE AND DOING I JUST WANT TO BUTT IN QUICKLY IF I MADE UNLIKE MOST AIRLINES YOUR FUEL BURN IS INCREASING PILOTS ARE HAVING TO MAKE UP TIME PRESUMABLY BY FLYING FASTER THAT IS NOT COST EFFECTIVE BUT I WONDER IF IT'S SAFE I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GOT THAT FROM THAT IS ALSO NOT CORRECT I'M AFRAID OUR PILOTS ARE HIGHLY TRAINED THEY ACTUALLY
A VERY FUEL EFFICIENT AGES PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST FUEL EFFICIENT HELEN'S IN THE WORLD IF YOU FLEW HIS JET YOU'D BE TWENTY TWO PERCENT ON YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMPARED TO ANY OTHER AIRLINE ON THE ROUTE THAT WE FLY PARTICULARLY THE THE AIRLINES AND SAY NO WE ARE NOT USING MORE FUEL IN FACT WE'RE USING LESS FUEL YEAR ON YEAR SO I'M NOT SURE WHERE YOU'RE GETTING THAT FROM EITHER O.K. CHIEF EXECUTIVE EASYJET KAREN MCCALL WE'RE GONNA LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU
VICTORIA THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN DAVID HENTY SPENT FIVE YEARS IN PRISON FOR FORGING PASSPORTS HE WENT ON TO FAKE MASTERPIECES AND SELL THEM ON EBAY YOU COULD'VE BOUGHT HIS LOWRY FOR THREE HUNDRED POUNDS WHEN THE TELEGRAPH BLEW HIS COVER HE WAS BANNED FROM THE SITE BUT THE PUBLICITY LED TO OTHER COMMISSIONS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD PEOPLE GOT IN CONTACT WANTING REPRODUCTIONS DAMN DONE AND NOW HE HAS AN EXHIBITION A SHOW OF FAKE SOME LITTLE BEING IN BRIGHTON LATER THIS MONTH

IT WOULD BE A CHANCE TO GET THEIR TARGETS IT'S UNBELIEVABLE IMPORTANCE OF THE GAME IS GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO WIPE OUT THE EMOTION SOMEONE DEAD BUT WE HAVE TO AS A WHICH OF THE CHANNEL AS THEN THEN WE HAVE TO LIMIT THE NEGATIVE PART OF SEE EMOTIONS
MCNULTY B.B.C. CHIEF FOOTBALL WRITER WILL BE COVERING THE MATCH PHIL GOOD MORNING TO YOU COME ON IN GARY SO AN EVENING ANOTHER STYLE DREW AN EMOTION AHEAD BUT FOR MANCHESTER UNITED NO ROOM FOR SENTIMENT NOT AT ALL NO BECAUSE FOR AT ALL WHICH APPEARED CLOSE FOR SO LONG SUDDENLY OPEN WITH THEIR WIN AT NORWICH CITY AND MANCHESTER CITY ONLY DRAWING AT HOME TO ARSENAL AFTER LOSING IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE AT SOUTHAMPTON THEY NOW HAVE THEIR FUTURE IN THEIR OWN HANDS IF YOU LIKE AS FAR AS THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IS CONCERNED AND THEY KNOW THAT VICTORY AT WEST HAM TONIGHT AT HOME TO BOURNEMOUTH AT THE WEEKEND
MEANS THEY'LL FINISH IN THE TOP FOUR KNOW WHAT I'M AT MANCHESTER CITY DO AT SWANSEA UNITED WILL BE WITHOUT ANTHONY MARSHALL BUT THEY WILL HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF HER BE SNOWING THEY WON AT WEST HAM IN THE F.A. CUP QUARTER FINAL REPLAY ALTHOUGH A SLATTERN BUILEACH MENTION TO YOU THERE WEST HAM WILL ALSO WON VICTORY THEMSELVES TO KEEP THEIR EUROPA LEAGUE HOPES HIGH AND OF COURSE IF UNITED COULD ACHIEVE A TOP FOUR FINISH IT WOULD MORE QUITE A TURN AROUND AT THE EXPENSE OF MANCHESTER CITY BECAUSE OF COURSE WHEN
PEP EOLAS ARRIVED ANNOUNCED TO BE COMING TO THE ETIHAD IN FEBRUARY IT SEEMED AS IF THE TWO CLUBS ARE MOVING IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS UNITED ARE DROPPED INTO THE EUROPA LEAGUE AND OF COURSE AT THAT TIME LEAVE ANGLES FUTURE WAS THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SPECULATION AND NOW ULTIMATELY THIS IS A MATCH AND THEN VICTORY IN THE FINAL GAME THIS IS A MATCH TONIGHT THAT COULD SAVE HIM THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT OF HIS MANCHESTER UNITED CAREER TONIGHT

CUP AT WEMBLEY AGAINST CRYSTAL PALACE NEXT MONTH IN FACT ONE GAALE EVEN NOTED THE CHANGE OF MOOD HIS PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY WHEN HE REMARKED THAT HE WAS BEING ASKED ABOUT UNITED'S OPPONENTS RATHER THAN HIS OWN SUCKING WHICH HE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN ON THE AGENDA FOR MONTHS NOW

IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS CLAIMED DAVID CAMERON DITCH TO DEMAND FOR AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON MIGRATION AS PART OF HIS E. U. RENEGOTIATION AFTER GERMANY OBJECTED TO THE PLANS THE FARMER WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY TOLD THE SUN THAT BERLIN WAS OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE FROM THE OUTSET AND IT'S VITO MEANT MISTER CAMERON'S ATTEMPTED REFORMS HAD FAILED DOWNING STREET SAID KERBS NEGOTIATED ON IN WORK BENEFITS FOR E.U. MIGRANTS WERE A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY FORWARD
SENIOR WHITE HOUSE DEFENCE AND FOREIGN POLICY OFFICIALS FROM THE PAST FOUR DECADES SO BRITAIN'S STANDING IN THE WORLD WOULD BE LESSENED IF IT LEFT THE E. U. THEY'VE RISEN TO THE TIMES TO WARN THAT THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LONDON AND WASHINGTON WOULD NOT COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS OF INFLUENCE FIVE FORMER NATO SECRETARIES GENERAL HAVE ALSO VOICED CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF BREAKFAST BRECK'S IT ON SECURITY LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SAY THEIR VIEWS ARE DATED
M.P.S HAVE CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO CLARIFY THE LEGAL CASE FOR THE USE OF AIR STRIKES BY UNMANNED DRONES AGAIN SUSPECTED TERRORISTS THE CROSS PARTY JOINT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS RAISED CONCERNS FOLLOWING THE KILLING AND SILLIER LAST YEAR OF A BRITISH CITIZEN BY AN R.A.F. DRONE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS DRONE STRIKES ARE CARRIED OUT ONLY IF THEY COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW
LABOUR HAS CALLED FOR AN URGENT REVIEW OF TESTS FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN ENGLAND AFTER A SECOND EXAM IN THREE WEEKS WAS PUBLISHED ONLINE BY MISTAKE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PUPILS WERE DUE TO SIT THE ASSESSMENT OF SPELLING PUNCTUATION AND GRAMMAR WHICH APPEARED FOR A SHORT TIME ON A PASSWORD PROTECTED EXAM BOARD WEBSITE BEFORE BEING TAKEN DOWN THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION HAS LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION
THE PREMIERE OF THE CANADIAN PROVINCE OF ALBERTA SAYS IT WILL BE AT LEAST TWO WEEKS BEFORE HER PLAN IS IN PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO BEGIN TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES AND FORT MCMURRAY OFFICIALS SAY EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF BUILDINGS HAD SURVIVED THE HUGE WILDFIRE WHICH CAUSE THE EVACUATION OF THE CITY
BRITISH DETECTIVES HAVE FLOWN TO THE GREEK ISLAND OF COS WHERE THEY'LL MAKE A FRESH APPEAL FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF BEN NEEDHAM ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE LITTLE BOY WAS TWENTY ONE MONTHS OLD WHEN HE VANISHED DURING THE HOLIDAY WITH HIS MOTHER AND GRANDPARENTS
IT'S NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO DECIDE ON THE EXACT ROUTE OF H. S. TWO HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE THAT WILL LINK LONDON WITH BIRMINGHAM LEEDS AND MANCHESTER THE SUNDAY TIMES REPORTED THAT PEOPLE ON THE PROJECT HAVE TOLD THEM THAT TO KEEP COSTS DOWN STATIONS AT MANCHESTER AIRPORT AND SHEFFIELD'S MEADOWHALL SHOPPING CENTRE
MIGHT BE AXED WHEN MANCHESTER AIRPORT IS THE U.K.'S THIRD BUSIEST AIRPORT AND IMPORTANT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SO CALLED NORTHERN POWER HOUSE WHICH IS WHY SOME ARE CONCERNED AT THESE REPORTS AND WE'RE JOINED BY TONY LLOYD WHO IS INTERIM MAYOR OF GREATER MANCHESTER AS WELL AS POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONER FOR THE AREA HE'S NOT SALFORD STUDIO GOOD MORNING MIND CHEW SO YOU WERE OBVIOUSLY AS INTO A MARE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE RAIL LINE OVER THERE
MONTHS YEARS WHAT INFORMATION HAVE YOU GOT HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT THESE STATIONS MIGHT BE DROPPED NO NONE WHATSOEVER THERE'S BEEN NO DIRECT INPUT INTO INTO PEOPLE IN GREATER MANCHESTER THAT I'M AWARE OF WHAT I CAN SAY THOUGH IS THAT THERE WOULD BE ABSOLUTE FURY
IF THIS THESE REPORTS HAVE PROVED TO HAVE ANY FOUNDATION AND I WILL BE SEEKING EARLY CLARIFICATION MANCHESTER AIRPORT IS THE THE THIRD LARGEST AIRPORT IN THE U.K. ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN EUROPE VERY FEW OF THE COUNTRIES
WHAT DON'T WASTE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LINK THAT AIRPORT ONTO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LINK THAT I ASSUME HE'S STILL PLAN TO GO AHEAD TWO TO MANCHESTER AND UNTIL HEAT SO WE DO NEED CLARIFICATION WE DO NEED TO HAVE THESE ROOM DENIED OR IF NOT THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO REPORT TO PARLIAMENT AMONGST OTHER PLACES AND OF COURSE I'LL BE RACING THIS NOW WITH BOTH THE TRANSPORT SECRETARY AND THE CHANCELLOR
BUT WE DO KNOW WE DO KNOW THAT MANCHESTER PICCADILLY IS THE CONTINUED BELLA WE KNOW THAT THE TRANSPORT SECRETARY PATRICK MCLOUGHLIN SAID AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THAT THAT CONTINUES TO THE RIGHT LOCATION FOR THE MANCHESTER TERMINUS AND WE KNOW FROM EARLIER THAT THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THE ACTUAL THE LINK TO THE AIRPORT IS COMPLICATED AND SPENCE HAVE BECAUSE OF THE TUNNELLING REQUIRED IF
IT'S REQUIRED TO DROP IT TO KEEP COSTS DOWN THEN IT MAY NOT BE IDEAL BUT DO YOU RECOGNISE THAT IT MIGHT HAVE TO BE AN OPTION NO THIS SORT OF CHEESE PARING MEAN FRANKLY WOULDN'T TAKE PLACE IF WE WERE DISCUSSING CROSS RAIL GOING ACROSS LONDON AND THAT THE PEOPLE AND INDEED FROM THE MIDLANDS UPWARDS WILL LOOK ASKANCE AT A VIEW THAT WE CAN CHEESE PIE
IN THIS WAY THIS THIS AIRPORT THE CASE FOR THE AIRPORT LINK IS AN OBVIOUS ONE THE RELATIVES THIS IS THAT WITHIN TWO HOURS TRAVEL OF THE AIRPORT ONE THIRD OF THE U.K. POPULATION LIVES IT'S AN IMPORTANT NATIONAL ASSET NOT SIMPLY FOR THOSE NORTHERNERS
SOMEWHERE UP THERE NOW AND IN THAT CONTEXT THE EXPECTATION IS THIS COAT THIS MUST GO AHEAD IT'S ALSO IN THE SAME REPORT IN PASSING ALTHOUGH IT IMPORTANTLY IN PASSING WAS THE THE THE THE THREAT TO A LINK WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE HIGH SPEED LINK TO CARRY ON UP TO SCOTLAND NOW I THINK
PEOPLE BOTH IN SCOTLAND AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND WILL BE DIZ MADE WITH THAT IDEA THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE THIS PIECEMEAL ROLL OUT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL DIDN'T IN BRITAIN THAT
IT'S CONCENTRATED INITIALLY IN ANY CASE ON LONDON TO BIRMINGHAM IS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT NORTH OF BIRMINGHAM BUT SURELY I MEAN YOU'VE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE AND IF THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE THEN THERE ISN'T THERE AN ARGUMENT LOOK LET'S GET IT STARTED AND THEN WE ADD ON WHEN WE CAN AFFORD IT I MEAN YOU SAY IT'S JUST THE NORTH IT'S FACING THIS THE PARING BACK BUT LINKS TO HEATHROW AND THE HIGH SPEED ONE THE LINK TO THE CHANNEL TUNNEL HAVE ALREADY GONE
THIS CHEESE PARING ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO BUILD NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK MOST OF US WILL REGARD IT AS BEING A HOLLOW PROMISE THE THE IDEA LET'S GET SOMETHING DOWN AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ONE OF THE FIT US ALL THE WAY THROUGH FRANKLYN'S BEEN THAT IF I SPEED NOW SPEED SYSTEM GOES LONDON TO BIRMINGHAM THE GOVERNMENT IN THE FUTURE
COULD END UP CANCELLING THE THE LINKED THE NORTH NOW THAT WOULD BE GROSSLY UNACCEPTABLE BUT IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT HERE THEY ARE WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PARTICULAR ROUTE THAT GOES NORTH IT IS THAT IT IS THE RUPERT AND THE ROUTE TO A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF NORTHERN INFRASTRUCTURE AND I WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE WELL THIRD PIECE AIRPORT IN THE COUNTRY AND THE AIRPORT FOR VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND IN TERMS OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE
TO FAIL TO LATE MAT ONTO ONTO THERE BARRY SPEED RAIL SYSTEM WOULD SIMPLY BE BOTH CHEESE PAIN BUT BUT FRUSTRATING IN THE SENSE THAT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE NORTH THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE OF THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND GOVERNMENT ROUND THE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NORTH DOES DEPEND
ON THIS AND THIS THIS KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IF THE COMMITMENT ISN'T THERE IT'S A VERY POWERFUL SIGNAL OF A FAILURE TO COMMIT TO THAT NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT AND YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO SEEK URGENT CLARIFICATION REALISTICALLY CAN YOU GET SOME SORT OF GUARANTEE NOW GIVEN THAT SO MUCH WILL NEED TO BE UP IN THE AIR WHILE COSTS ARE BEING WORKED OUT
WELL THE THE MAIN STRUCTURE NO NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND REALLY OUGHT TO DO YOU KNOW THE IDEA FOR PUTTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN FOR THE FUTURE IT SHOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE COMPREHENSIVE YES IN TERMS OF THE LINE TO MANCHESTER PICCADILLY BUT COMPREHENSIVE INCLUDING
THE THIRD BIGGEST AIRPORT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WITH TONY LLOYD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES THE RETURN OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHANCELLOR TO THE FRAY WITH BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO UP AGAINST THEM MARKS THE MOST INTENSE PHASE YET IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
THE PAPER SAYS MISTER CAMERON SPEECH YESTERDAY CONFIRMED THAT HIS CAMPAIGN WILL FOCUS RELENTLESSLY ON THE ECONOMY AND SECURITY WHILE THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN BELIEVES IT HAS TWO MESSAGES THAT CUT THROUGH TO VOTERS IMMIGRATION AND THE COST OF BRITAIN'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE E.U. WHAT'S NEEDED ARGUES THE TELEGRAPH IS SOMEONE WHO CAN ARTICULATE A VISION OF BRITAIN OUTSIDE THE E.U. AND MISTER JOHNSON IT SAYS HE'S THE MAN TO DO IT THE DAILY EXPRESS THINKS LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS FACE THE FIGHT OF THEIR POLITICAL LIVES BUT WITH INDICATIONS THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE YET TO BESIDE THE REFERENDUM
IS THERE TO BE ONE THAT ANY MAIL CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPAIGN ON THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ISN'T IT IRONIC THAT HAVING CALLED THE REFERENDUM WITH THE AIM OF HOLDING THE TORIES TOGETHER ARGUES THE PAPER MY KAMEN SHOULD NOW BE DEEPENING THE RIFT BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES ONE OF THE FEATURES OF THE CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGNERS BEEN THE USE OF LETTERS FROM EXPERTS BUSINESS LEADERS AND FORMER POLITICIANS AND TODAY THE TREND CONTINUES THE TELEGRAPHS MAJ MAIN STOREYS DEVOTED TO A WARNING AND A LETTER FROM FIVE FORMER NATO SECRETARY GENERAL
BUT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD GIVE SUCCOUR TO THE WEST'S ENEMIES THE TIMES ALSO LEAVES WITH A LETTER THIS TIME FROM THIRTEEN FORMER U.S. SECRETARIES OF STATE AND DEFENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISERS SAYING BRITAIN WOULD HAVE LESS CLOUT OUTSIDE THE E.U. IN AN EDITORIAL THE PAPER SAYS THEIR VIEWS SHOULD NOT BE DISMISSED LIKELY WHEN SO MANY SECURITY THREATS ARE LINKED TO EXTREMISM IN EUROPE IT STANDS TO REASON THAT WASHINGTON SHOULD VALUE CLOSE EUROPEAN CO OPERATION
THE FINANCIAL TIMES SEES NORTH KOREA'S DECISION TO EXPEL THE B.B.C. CORRESPONDENT RUPERT WINGFIELD HAYES IS THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF HOW THE COUNTRY'S EFFORTS HAD INTERNATIONAL PROPAGANDA ARE BACKFIRING THE PAPERS CORRESPONDENT IN PYONGYANG BELIEVES THE B. B. C. TEAM'S EXPERIENCE ADDS TO THE SENSE OF FEAR AND FRUSTRATION PERMEATING AMONG ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOREIGN JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN INVITED TO THE COUNTRY THE EYE SAYS MY WINKLE HAYES JOINS A DISTINGUISHED LIST OF JOURNALISTS INCLUDING SUE LLOYD ROBERTS AND CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS WHO HAVE EARNED THE WRATH OF THE HARDLINE REGIME
THE EXPRESS IS RELIEVED THAT THE CHILCOT INQUIRY INTO THE IRAQ WAR WILL FINALLY BE PUBLISHED IN JULY SEVEN YEARS AFTER IT WAS LAUNCHED BUT THE PAPER DESCRIBED THE DELAYS SCANDALOUS AND SAYS THE FAMILIES OF THE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE SERVICE PERSONNEL WHO DIED SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE TO WAIT SO LONG FOR THE TRUTH THE DAILY MIRROR HOPES THE FINAL VERSION IS WORTH OF WEIGHT AND THAT NO STONE WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT UNTURNED
AND FINALLY THE TELEGRAPH HAS SOME BAD NEWS FOR VICARS AND THEIR EFFORTS ARE JOKES AREN'T POPULAR WITH CONGREGATIONS AND SURVEY OF REGULAR CHURCHGOERS FOUND THAT UNDER TWO PER CENT WANTED SALMON'S TO INCLUDE A SENSE OF HUMOUR THE FORMER ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY LORD CAREY SAYS HE'S GREAT BELIEVER IN HUMOUR BUT RAVEN CAPE OTLEY ISN'T CONVINCED TELLING THE PAPER OR VICAR CRACKING A JOKE THAT ISN'T FUNNY IS THE EQUIVALENT OF DAD DANCING
THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHITBY IN NORTH YORKSHIRE USED TO BE HOME TO A BOOMING FISHING INDUSTRY BUT NOW THERE ARE HARDLY ANY WORKING FISHERMEN LEFT AND EVEN FEWER WITH ANYTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THE E.U. AS PART OF OUR SERIES LOOKING AT HOW DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SEE THE E.U. REFERENDUM SO WE CONWAY REPORTS
AT THE SHIPYARD IN WHITBY THEY'RE BUILDING RESILIENT A TWENTY SEVEN METRE WHITE FISH TRAWLER
IT'S DESTINED FOR SHETLAND THAT'S HARDLY SURPRISING BECAUSE THE LAST TIME THEY BUILT A WHITE FISH TRAWLER
TO BE USED IN WATERS OFF WHITBY WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE DECLINE OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY FISHERMEN LOCALLY WANT TO GET OUT OF THE E.U. TO STOP THAT DECLINE
BUT THE MANAGEMENT HERE AT THIS SHIP BUILDERS AND NERVOUS ABOUT TALK OF BRICKS
SALLY ATKINSON AND PROJECT MANAGER AT PUCKLE MARINE ENGINEERING IN WHITBY
WE'VE CURRENTLY GOT A FEW BOOKS IN THE PIPELINE TO BUILD IN THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF TO THREE YEARS
THE EQUIPMENT MATERIALS AT THE BUY IN FROM EUROPE AND EUROS OBVIOUSLY IF WE COME OUT OF THAT THE SINGLE MARKET
THE PRICE COULD CHANGE AND IT COULD AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY THE PRICE OF THOSE GOODS DO YOU THINK THE STAKES ARE ACTUALLY QUITE HIGH YEAH I THINK THE STICKS
BORIS JOHNSON'S TALKING ABOUT IT WE WERE DOING A DEAL FOR THE FOR THE SINGLE MARKET IF IT WERE TO COME OUT BUT IT'S TIME IT WERE TIPPED TO RENEGOTIATE SUCH A DEAL
I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD
I'M AT THE ENDEAVOUR WHARF AND HERE AT THE A BAIT CALLED COPIOUS
IT'S THE TOWN'S LAST REMAINING WHITE FISH TRAWLER
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AT SEA FISHING FOR COD AND HADDOCK
INSTEAD IT'S HERE BECAUSE IT'S BROKEN AND THE OWNERS THE BREWER FAMILY
RIGHT NOW TAKING THE ENGINE APART CONSISTENTLY BETTER JUST TELL ME NO TELL ME WHAT IS THAT IT'S A FISH WHAT A PUMP THAT WAS ENGINE
I'M RICHARD BROUGHT I AM ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING FISHERMEN STILL WORKING FOR WHITBY
I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE THAT THE WAY WE'VE BEEN TREATED BY
IF WE ARE RUNNING TIGHT ON QUOTAS NOW WHERE WE HAD EVEN HALFWAY THROUGH THE DAY
BUT EVEN IF WE CAME OUT OF THE E.U. THE GOVERNMENT HERE WOULD IMPOSE A QUOTA I MEAN THERE ARE CONSERVATION REASONS
MUST BE CONSERVATION WE WOULD HATE TO GO BACK TO A SYSTEM OF A FREE FOR ALL AND IF WE DO AN ALLY HOPES OF EDIBLE WITH JILL TAKE CONTROL OF OUR OWN WATERS
THAT WE CAN WORK WITH GOVERNMENT AND THE CONSERVATION PEOPLE BUT I HOPE THEY'RE DORIEN AT THAT WE MUST HAVE A WAY FORWARD AS WELL
WHITBY IS PROUD OF ITS HISTORY THERE'S THESE SEVENTH CENTURY ABBEY UP ON THE HILL AS THE FACT THAT CAPTAIN COOK'S SHIP ENDEAVOUR WAS BUILT HERE AND BRAM STOKER WROTE DRACULA
BUT PEOPLE HERE SAY THAT THEY DON'T WANT THIS TOWN JUST TO BE A TOURIST ATTRACTION THEY WANT IT TO BE A WORKING PORT YET IN THE WORDS OF ONE FISHERMAN IT'S INCREASINGLY FEELING LIKE A MUSEUM
WE DO USE A SOFT WOOD BEARS WITH A SHARED THINGS THIS ISN'T IT
IT DOESN'T GET MORE HERITAGE THAN FORTUNE'S KIPPERS THEY'VE SMOKED HERRING HERE FOR THE LAST ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR YEARS
I'M BARRY BROWN PARTNER THEN FORTUNE'S KIPPERS WITH MY BROTHER DEREK WE CANNOT SEE ANY BENEFITS FROM FROM THROW BUSINESS FROM THE NORMAL
DO YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO GET OUT PERSONALLY YEAH YEAH I DO WHY BUT THAT DOES NOT SCARE MONGERING GOING ON I JUST READ THIS MORNING WE'VE GONE UP WORLD WHILE STRAIGHT OR DO PEOPLE OLD PEOPLE THINK IF THEY READ THESE HEADLINES THAT ACTUALLY WERE CHILDREN DURING THE WAR
VERY PRETTY DECIDED THEN I AM SO EVEN MORE THAN IT WOULD HEADLINES AT COME NOT NOW THAT STRENGTH AND YOUR RESULTS TO VOTE TO US TO GET
IT'S STRENGTHENED MY MY THOUGHTS ON ON THE TACTICS THAT HAD BEEN USED I'D SOONER SEE FACTS
ZOE CONWAY AT REPORTING FROM WHITBY AND WE'LL BE BACK THERE IN THE NEXT HOUR NOW THOUGH IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER AND A TUNBRIDGE WELLS STUDIO THIS MORNING AT FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IS THE HISTORIAN AND WRITER FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH TIM STANLEY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
LAST WEEK SAW THE LOCAL ELECTIONS NOW WE HAVE SEVEN WEEKS OF E.U. REFERENDUM TO LOOK FORWARD TO IT CAN FEEL AS IF THE LOUD ANGRY CYCLE OF POLITICS NEVER CEASES AND SOME ARE KEEN TO ESCAPE YOU CAN COUNT ME AMONG THEM
LAST WEEK I JOINED A CAMEL SAFARI INTO THE SAHARA DESERT AT SUNSET I CLIMBED THE HIGHEST DUNE CRAWLING THROUGH SHIFTING SANDS ON MY HANDS AND KNEES TO REACH THE TOP JUST AS THE SUN TOUCHED THE HORIZON I SAID A ROSARY BATHED IN FIRE THE BERBER GUIDES WERE PROBABLY A BIT AMUSED
WHEN I GOT BACK HOME ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID TO ME AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO RUN AWAY FROM THE DESERT NOT INTO IT
I DISAGREE YES DESERTS CAN BE FRIGHTENING THEY MAKE A MOCKERY OF OUR RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY GET LOST OUT THERE AND UNLESS YOU CAN READ THE STARS YOU WILL STAY LAST AND YOU WILL DIE
BUT CHRISTIANS HAVE OFTEN DELIBERATELY PUT THEMSELVES IN DESERTS CATHOLIC MONASTICISM FINDS INFLUENCE IN THE SO CALLED DESERT FATHERS MEN AND WOMEN IN THE FIRST FEW CENTURIES OF THE FAITH WHO TRIED TO LIVE AESTHETIC LIVES OF HUMBLE CONTEMPLATION IN THE SANDS
THEIR FAME SPREAD AND BECAME PROBLEMATIC YOU CAN'T DO MUCH CONTEMPLATING WHEN YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY AUTOGRAPH HUNTERS
SIMEON STYLE I.T. IS A HOLY MAN WHO LIVED IN THE FIFTH CENTURY ESCAPE THE CROWDS OF PILGRIMS BY CLIMBING UP A STONE PILLAR
HE LIVED ABOUT TWENTY METRES OFF THE GROUND FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEARS
DESERT MYSTICS WANT TO IMITATE CHRIST BUT THEY ALSO PAY A TRIBUTE TO THE SPIRITUAL BENEFITS OF PROFOUND ISOLATION
OUT THERE THERE ARE NO DISTRACTIONS GIVING THOSE WHO SEEK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A VERY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD
I'M CONVINCED THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE GREAT MONOTHEISM FLOURISH IN THE DESERT
THERE IS LITTLE NATURE TO WORSHIP SO THE JEWS CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS LOOKED UPWARDS INSTEAD AT THE SKY
THEY CAME TO RELY ON A GOD WHO GIVETH AND TAKETH AWAY THE SAMA SAYS THAT THE LORD PUNISHES THE WICKED BY TURNING FRUITFUL LAND INTO SALT WASTE
AND THAT HE BLESSES THE GOOD BY TURNING THE DESERT INTO POOLS OF WATER
THE REWARD HER FAITH IS TO BE LED OUT OF THE DESERT AND TO AN OASIS SO DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT GOD WANTS US TO WALK AWAY FROM THE SANDS
I THINK NOT BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS THIS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SEEK HIS METAPHORICAL IT STANDS FOR WHIST
I RETURNED IN THE SAHARA TO A DESERT HERE IN BRITAIN A DESERT OF POLITICAL CONFLICT PEOPLE COMPLAIN TO POLLSTERS THAT THERE IS A POVERTY IN THEIR NATIONAL CONVERSATION BUT THEY LACK INSPIRATION
FOR ME THAT INSPIRATION IS FOUND IN SEEKING AND INNER PEACE THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO ACHIEVE IT BUT FOR ME THE MOST FRUITFUL AND REFRESHING IS TO ESCAPE TO SOLITUDE TO FIND ANSWERS IN FAITH THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH TIM STANLEY IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
AS MUCH AS A FIFTH OF THE CANADIAN TOWN OF FORT MCMURRAY HOME TO NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY THE WILD FIRES THAT HAVE BEEN RAGING FOR THE PAST WEEK A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER IS HELPING THE EFFORT TO CONTROL THE FIRES AND ASSESSMENT OF THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN MADE BY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN BACK INTO PARTS OF THE EVACUATED TOWN WHICH IS AT THE HEART OF CANADA'S VAST OIL PRODUCING REGION A CORRESPONDENT LAURA BAKER HAS ALSO BEEN ALLOWED INTO FORT MCMURRAY AND SENT THIS FIRST HAND ACCOUNT OF WHAT SHE SAW
IT'S HARD TO EVEN DESCRIBE WHAT I'M LOOKING AT I CAN SEE ABOUT KIT CAR
THE REMAINS OF A BARBECUE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY STILL IN IT STAND SO THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A GARDEN AS A FAMILY SWING
AND THEN AMIDST ALL THE HOSTAS JUST COMPLETELY BEEN DESTROYED THE FIRE JUST SEEMS TO HOLLOW
THE HOSES INNIT YOU CAN SEE THE BEASTS YOU CAN SEE BITS OF BRICK AND RUBBLE
BLACKNESS BUT INSTEAD OF BRICKS AND MORTAR IN WOOL
THERE'S JUST NOTHING THERE AND THE FIRE CHIEF DERBY ALAN WANTED TO SEND A MESSAGE BACK TO THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS WHO MAY BE WATCHING ANY OF THIS ON TELEVISION WHO MIGHT BE GETTING UPSET HE HIMSELF SAY DID EMOTIONAL AS HE SPOKE A LITTLE EARLIER
I TRULY BELIEVE NOTHING ELSE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE THAT WASN'T DONE TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE AND THE STRUCTURES WITHIN OUR SAVINGS I WANT US TO RECOGNISE THE TRUE HEROES ARE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAME IN
A FIVE FIVE ARE FROM ONE STATION INFORMANT VERY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS BATTLING THE BLAZE UP IN THE NORTH OF THE CITY AS THEY PROGRESS DOWN THE ROAD THEY HAPPENED OR START FIGHTING THE FAR ON HIS OWN HOME THEY LOST HIS HEART
HE DIDN'T DROP HIS NOZZLE ONLY MOVED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR'S HOUSE AND CONTINUED TO FIGHT THAT FIRE AND HE FOUGHT THAT FIRE FOR A FURTHER TWENTY TWO HOURS BEFORE HE JUST COULDN'T STAND
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS I SPOKE TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE FORESTRY AND MANY OF THE FI CONDITIONS IN THE WAY THE FIRE BEHAVE NO NO ONE'S EVER SEEN ANYTHING
DARREN WHO'S BEEN RUNNING OPERATIONS SAID THIS IS REWRITING THE BOOK THE WAY THIS THING HAPPEN THE WAY TROUBLED THE WAY IT BEHAVED SO
THEY'RE REWRITING THEIR FORMULAS ON OUR FIRES BEHAVED BASS ON THIS
THERE'S THE BUS SLOWLY CREEPS BACK TOWARDS THE POLICE CORDON
LAST TIME THIS ROAD WAS USED IT WAS USED FOR THOSE FLEEING THE FIRE LIKE THE RESIDENTS OF FORT MCMURRAY HAVE BEEN TOLD
BUT THIS IS A HOME THAT THEY WILL RETURN TO THE BOMB WHERE
A PLAN IS BEING DRAWN UP THERE WILL BE TOLD THAT PLAN IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS
BUT AS WE RE EVEN YOU CAN STILL SEE SMOKE RISING YOU CAN SEE THE BLACKENED
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHEN THE REBUILDING WILL BE GOOD
NORA BAKER REPORTING FROM FORT MCMURRAY WE'RE JOINED FROM THE RADIO CAR BY THE CANADIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER GORDON CAMPBELL GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND YOU USED TO BE THE PREMIERE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA THE PROVINCE THAT NEIGHBOURS ALBERTO WHEN YOU WERE IN THAT ROLE HOW MUCH DID YOU FEAR THIS SORT OF SITUATION WHERE WILDFIRES RAGE OUT OF CONTROL
WELL BOTH AND BRITISH COLUMBIA ALBERTA IMPACT IN LOTS OF CANADA THERE'S THE LILY THOUSANDS OF FOREST FIRES A YEAR I THINK WE SOMETIMES FORGET THAT I WAS WHEN I WAS THERE WAS A HUGE FIRE IN BRITISH COLUMBIA WERE WE LAST NEIGHBOURHOODS AND COMMUNITIES IN COLOGNE AND BROKE REGION OF BRITISH COLUMBIA CALLED THE OPEN ARGH
YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE THERE FOR BIG MIRROR MARIE SITUATION AND YOU REALISE THE SCALE OF IT THE FIRE TAKES UP APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TERRITORY OR DISTANCES OF THE LAND WITHIN THE M. TWENTY FIVE HERE IN LONDON AND IT WAS FIRES WERE SO ENORMOUS I THINK SOMETIMES WE SEE THEM ON THE TELEVISION IF THEY CALL THAT'S CONTAINABLE THEY'RE NOT CONTAINABLE BY MAN THERE A CONTAINABLE BY NATURE
WE'VE HAD A VERY FORTUNATE TURN OF EVENTS IS SOME GOOD NEWS THE WEATHER'S GOT A LITTLE COOLER THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY TOOL OF DAMPING THIS FIRE DOWN AND PUTTING IT OUT AND HONESTLY THE THING THAT IS MOST
THE FIRE IS NOT OVER YET IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING OVER AND THE TRAUMA THE ONGOING TRIAL OF THEIR COMMUNITY WILL WILL BE ONGOING FOR MONTHS AND POTENTIALLY YEARS TO COME IT THEY'RE JUST DEVASTATING EVENTS AND THERE ARE THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR BUT THIS AS WAS MENTIONED IN YOUR STORY TODAY IS UNPRECEDENTED IN SCALE AND SCOPE IN THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE FLAMES WENT ACROSS THE WAY AND YOU SAID UNCONTAINABLE AND YET MOST MOST FOREST FIRES ARE CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY
AREN'T THEY I MEAN NOT NOT NECESSARILY NEGLIGENT OR UNTOWARD HUMAN ACTIVITY BUT THAT HUMAN INTERVENTION IS IS A PART OF WHAT HAPPENS
HUMAN INTERVENTION IS A PART BUT WE HAVE LITERALLY AGAIN DOZENS TO HUNDREDS OF FIRES THAT ARE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING AND WHEN THEY'RE SMALL ENOUGH THEY CAN BE CONTAINED BUT AS THE IF THEY GROW TOO QUICKLY EXPAND THE EDGES OF THE FIRES BECOME INCREDIBLE THE AIR QUALITY CHANGES THE THE WEATHER SYSTEMS FOR A FIRE LIKE THAT TO THEIR OWN WEATHER SYSTEMS AS WHERE THE FIRES CAN MOVE AS MUCH AS EIGHTY MILES AN HOUR AND ANT INCLUDING INTO URBAN AREAS LIKE FORT MCMURRAY WHICH
YOU KNOW I MEAN TERRIFYING FOR ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO WERE FORCED TO FLEE HIS TENT IS THERE NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE EVEN TO TO A CONTAINED WILL PREVENT THEM FROM REACHING URBAN AREAS OR IS THIS A NATURAL PHENOMENON THAT THAT CANADIANS HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT WITH THE RISKS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED
I THINK IT'S A NET IS A NATURAL PHENOMENON THIS IS A FUN ARTLESS AS A MUM THAT'S WAY OUT OF SCALE WITH ANYTHING THAT'S GONE BEFORE TYPICALLY THE FIRES ARE NOT IN THE URBAN AREAS I THINK THAT THEY'RE HIS EFFORTS MADE AGAIN WHEN YOU ME PROBABLY AN URBAN AREAS THEY'RE CONTAINED MORE RAPIDLY BECAUSE A DISCOVERED MORE RAPIDLY IN A MORE ISOLATED AREA ONCE THEY ONCE THEY'VE BEGUN
THEY CAN AS THEY MENTIONED THEY MOVE WITH THEIR OWN SPEED I THINK PEOPLE JUST HAVE NO CONCEPT OF THE SCALE OF THESE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FLAME FROM A FOREST FIRE AND A TELEVISION IT LOOKS KIND OF MORE THAT'S MANAGEABLE YEAH IF YOU FLY OVER A FOREST FIRE AS I'VE DONE THE SCALE OF THEM THIS THE HEIGHT OF THE FLAMES TO SPEED WITH WHICH THE FLAMES ACT THE
INCREDIBLE INTENSITY IN THIS FIRE THERE ABOUT WHAT FIRE BARBARA'S OR COULDN'T FLY OVER THE FIRE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO HOT THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE SORT OF BEYOND OUR IMAGINATION BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE CAN THINK A BOY SOMETIMES WHAT WE CAN CONTAIN AND SO WHEN THE SOCIAL ACTIONS TAKE PLACE WHEN YOU MOVE AID TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IT'S AND IT'S GREAT THAT WE HAVE DONE SO WELL ARE PROTECTING THE PEOPLE
THE PREMIER WAS THERE YESTERDAY AND LOOKED AT THEIR SCHOOLS ARE BRRR STILL STANDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE STILL SEEMS TO BE RELATIVELY GOOD BUT THE COMMUNITIES AND THE PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE GOING TO BE GONE FOR EVER AND THAT HAS A LONG TERM IMPACT ON THE WHOLE SPIRIT OF THE COMMUNITY IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO RECOVER FROM THAT ANT ON ON THE ECONOMY OF THIS AREA WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE CANADIAN ECONOMY BIT BECAUSE OF THE OIL INDUSTRY
IT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT LIKE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SCALE OF THE IMPACT WE HAVEN'T FELT IT WILL HAVE TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT THERE'S THE SERVICES AFTER THE FIRE BUT IT WILL ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT YES RIGHT AND HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA FOR HOW MANY WEEKS IT WILL BE BEFORE BEFORE PEOPLE AT LEAST THOSE WHOSE HOMES NOT BEEN DESTROYED RETURN TO FORT MCMURRAY
THEY'RE STARTING TO DEVELOP A PLAN NOW THERE'S A MENTION MENTIONED THE PREMIER VISITED YESTERDAY THERE WILL BE A PLAN FOR PEOPLE TO RETURN BUT HERE'S THE THING THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO GET IN TERMS OF HUMAN TERMS THEY'RE NOT RETURNING TO THE SAME PLACE THAT RETURNING TO A PLACE THAT HAS NOW BEEN DEVASTATED NEIGHBOURHOODS CHANGED THERE'S A GREAT TURNOVER AND NEIGHBOURHOODS AFTER PEOPLE GO BACK TO THEIR HOME
IT'S NOT THE SAME PLACE AS THEY LEFT THEY HAVE A HUGE AND TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE OF THEY'VE ALL GONE THROUGH AND IT'LL BE MONTHS BEFORE FORMING MARIA'S BACK TO WHAT FOR THAT ROOM COULD HAVE BEEN IN WAS GORDON CAMPBELL HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR CANADA THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY THE TENTH OF MAY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER OF ALLOWING GERMANY TO VETO ONE OF HIS KEY DEMANDS PRIOR TO FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS OVER BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. WARNINGS THAT BREAKS IT WOULD DAMAGE WESTERN SECURITY HAVE BEEN ECHOED BY STRING OR FORMER NATO CHIEFS AND SENIOR WASHINGTON FIGURES
THE NEW TEA HAS CALLED FOR THE RESULTS OF THIS YEAR'S NEW PRIMARY SCHOOL TEST TO BE SET ASIDE AFTER A SECOND PAPER WAS PUBLISHED ONLINE BY MISTAKE AND SCIENTISTS AT KEW GARDENS HAVE CARRIED OUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THE FIRST WORLDWIDE INVENTORY OF PLANT SPECIES THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY SUSAN
THE FARMER WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS CLAIMED THAT GERMANY FORCE DAVID CAMERON TO ABANDON ONE OF THE KEY DEMANDS HE WAS PLANNING IN HIS Y. U. RE NEGOTIATIONS LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THEY WERE UNVEILED MY DUNCAN SMITH WHO QUIT THE CABINET IN MARCH HAS TOLD THE SOUND THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WANTED AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON Y. U. MIGRATION TO THE U.K. BUT AGREED TO DROP THE PROPOSAL AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR BECAUSE OF PROTESTS FROM BERLIN
HE SUGGESTS THE WHOLE SPEECH MISTER CAMERON DELIVERED IN NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN SETTING OUT WHAT BRITAIN WOULD BE SEEKING WAS SHOWN TO THE GERMANS BEFOREHAND FOR APPROVAL DOWNING STREET SAYS MISTER CAMERON HAD HIMSELF ALREADY DECIDED A DIFFERENT WAY OF DEALING WITH IMMIGRATION WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE HERE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
IN AN INTERVENTION WHICH SEEMS CERTAIN TO FURTHER IN BITTER RELATIONS MY DUNCAN SMITH TODAY CLAIMS THE PRIME MINISTER WAS SO DESPERATE FOR GERMAN BACKING HE ALLOWED CHANCELLOR MERKEL A VETO OVER HIS DEMANDS IN PARTICULAR HE DROPPED PROPOSALS FOR EMERGENCY BRAKE ON E.U. MIGRATION AFTER THEY WERE SHOWN TO BERLIN AND REJECTED WE PUT OURSELVES IN A COMPLIANT POSITION TO ANOTHER COUNTRY SAYS MISTER DUNCAN SMITH
HE ALSO SUGGESTS THE DEAL STRUCK BY MISTER CAMERON HAS LEFT BRITAIN IN A WEAKER POSITION UNABLE TO RESIST MOVES TOWARDS GREATER EUROZONE INTEGRATION THREATENING THE POSITION OF THE CITY HIS COMMENTS FORM PART OF A MOVE BY THE BRICKS HAD CAMPAIGN TO RE FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE DEAL STRUCK BY MISTER CAMERON WHICH THEY BELIEVE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEFEND
DOWNING STREET THIS MORNING SAID THEY DIDN'T RECOGNISE MY DUNCAN SMITH'S CLAIMS AND HAVE POINTED TO REMARKS BY MISTER CAMERON AT THE TIME IN WHICH HE DISMISSED AN EMERGENCY BRAKE AS AN ARCANE MECHANISM THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HOWEVER THEY HAVE NOT CATEGORICALLY DENIED ANY GERMAN INVOLVEMENT AND THE ROLE OF THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR WAS ALWAYS REGARDED AS CENTRAL TO SECURING WIDER BACKING FOR BRITAIN'S DEMANDS
FIVE FORMER SECRETARIES GENERAL OF NATO HAVE VOICED CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECT BRECK'S IT MIGHT HAVE ON SECURITY IN A LETTER TO THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THEY SAY VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD UNDERMINE THE ALLIANCE AND GIVE SUCCOUR TO THE WEST'S ENEMIES ARE REMARKS ECHO THOSE OF THE CURRENT SECRETARY GENERAL INSTALLED IN BACK
SENIOR FIGURES FROM EVERY U.S. GOVERNMENT SINCE PRESIDENT CARTER'S ADMINISTRATION HAVE ALSO URGED VOTERS TO REMAIN IN THE UNION THEY SAID THAT THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH NOT COMPENSATE FOR BRITAIN'S LOSS OF GLOBAL INFLUENCE IF IT LEFT THE E.U. THE GROUP OF THIRTEEN FORMER SECRETARIES OF STATE DEFENCE SECRETARIES AND NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORS INCLUDE GEORGE SHORTS LEON PUT ETTA AND MADELEINE ALLBRIGHT HERE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO
THE SIGNATORIES TO THIS LETTER HAVE FOR FORTY YEARS BEEN THE PILLARS OF THE AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY INTELLIGENCE AND DEFENCE COMMUNITIES THEY SHOULD COME TOGETHER LIKE THIS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS UNDERLINES THE DEEP CONCERNED FELT IN THE U.S. ESTABLISHMENT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U.
THEY SAY THAT THE U.K.'S PLACE AND INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD WOULD BE DIMINISHED AND THAT EUROPE WOULD BE DANGEROUSLY WEAK AND THEY ALSO WARN THAT THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. WOULDN'T COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS OF CLOUD AND INFLUENCE THAT BRITAIN WOULD SUFFER IF IT LEFT THE E. U. THE AUTHORS SAY THIS IS TRUE IN FOREIGN POLICY DEFENCE POLICY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE MATTERS
THEIR ARGUMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE MADE BY PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE WAS IN LONDON JUST OVER TWO WEEKS AGO THE FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY AND LEAVE CAMPAIGNER LIAM FOX HAS DISMISSED THE WARNING AS OUT OF DATE HE SAID THE SIGNATORIES WERE FROM A VERY DIFFERENT YOU
THERE'S BEEN A NARROWING OF THE GAP IN THE E.U. DEBATE AMONG BUSINESS LEADERS IN ITS FINAL POLL BEFORE THE REFERENDUM THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE FOUND SUPPORT FOR STAYING IN HAD DROPPED FROM SIXTY PERCENT TO FIFTY FOUR PERCENT SINCE FEBRUARY THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BUSINESS PEOPLE SURVEYED WISHING TO LEAVE HAS RISEN FROM THIRTY TO THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S AS OUCH THE GOVERNMENT TO CLARIFY THE LEGAL CASE FOR THE USE OF AIR STRIKES BY UNMANNED DRONES AGAIN SUSPECTED TERRORISTS THE CALL FROM THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS FOLLOWS THE KILLING AND SYRIA LAST YEAR OF A BRITISH CITIZEN BY AN R.A.F. DRONE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS DRONE STRIKES ARE A LAST RESORT CARRIED OUT IN COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW WITH A LABOUR M.P. HARRIET HARMAN WHO CHAIRS THE JOINT COMMITTEE
TOLD US MORE COULD BE DONE TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY WHEN STRIKES WERE CONDUCTED IN COUNTRIES WHERE BRITAIN IS NOT INVOLVED IN A CONFLICT EVERYBODY'S CLEAR ABOUT THE LAWS OF WAR BUT WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF A WAR SITUATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL LAW REQUIRES IS THAT THIS INDEPENDENT SCRUTINY AFTERWARDS
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS SAID THEY'RE GOING TO BE TARGETING PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE'RE NOT IN ARMED CONFLICT BUT THERE'S NO SCRUTINY INDEPENDENT OF THE M.O.D. AS TO WHETHER THE INTELLIGENCE WAS RIGHT WHETHER THE PERSON THEY KILLED WAS THE RIGHT PERSON AND WHETHER IT WAS JUSTIFIED
GERMAN POLICE SAY AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STABBED AT A TRAIN STATION IN THE TOWN OF GRAFTING EAST OF MUNICH ONE HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK WHICH HAPPENED AT ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK THIS MORNING A MAN'S BEEN ARRESTED A BAVARIAN RADIO STATION SAYS REPORTS FROM WITNESSES THAT FRASERS AND ARABIC WAS SHOUTED DURING THE ASSAULT HAVE BEEN CHECKED BY POLICE LABOUR HAS CALLED FOR AN EMERGENCY REVIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF SATS EXAMS AFTER A SECOND PAPER WAS ACCIDENTALLY PUBLISHED EARLY
HER GRAMMAR PUNCTUATION AND SPELLING TEST DUE TO BE TAKEN THIS MORNING BY TEN AND ELEVEN YEAR OLDS ACROSS ENGLAND APPEARED ON A PASSWORD PROTECTED SITE FOR MARKERS THREE WEEKS AGO IT EMERGED THAT A DIFFERENT EXAM HAD BEEN POSTED ON THE INTERNET WITH PRACTICE MATERIALS THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION SAYS IT'S INVESTIGATING WITH THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS CHRISTINE BLOWER TOLD US THE ERROR UNDERLINED THE CASE FOR DISREGARDING THE TEST RESULTS
HOWEVER IT HAPPENED IT HAS COMPROMISED THE TESTS WE DIDN'T LIKE THE TEST IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THE FACT IS THE TESTS ARE COMPROMISED AND IT JUST ADDS TO THE GENERAL SENSE OF CHAOS ABOUT NOT JUST THE CURRICULUM BUT IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT THIS YEAR AND SO WE REPEAT THAT WE THINK THAT FOR THIS YEAR THE RESULTS OF THESE TESTS SHOULD BE SCRAPPED AND NOT USED FOR ANY PURPOSE WHATSOEVER
THE SILLY AND ARMED FORCES SEE A TRUCE IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF ALEPPO WHICH WAS DUE TO EXPIRE LAST NIGHT HAS BEEN EXTENDED FOR A FURTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS UNTIL MIDNIGHT ON WEDNESDAY WHAT'S BEEN CALLED A REGIME OF SILENCE WAS INTRODUCED LAST WEEK TO TRY TO QUELL A SURGE IN FIGHTING THAT HAD LEFT ALMOST THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE DEAD
A B. B. C. INVESTIGATION HAS FOUND THAT MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MIGRANTS WHO DIED TRYING TO CROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN HAD BEEN BURIED IN UNMARKED GRAVES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AT LEAST SEVENTY BURIAL SITES WERE FOUND IN TURKEY GREECE AND ITALY IS OUR CORRESPONDENT PLENTY MIA HAD MANDAS
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN TEN PEOPLE A DAY HAVE DIED CROSSING THE MEDITERRANEAN MOSTLY FROM TURKEY OR LIBYA TRYING TO REACH EUROPE OF THE TOTAL MIGRANTS ESTIMATED TO HAVE DIED SINCE THEN AT LEAST ONE AND SEVEN HAS BEEN BURIED IN AN UNMARKED GRAVE AS THE AUTHORITIES WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THEM
LOCAL AUTHORITIES ADMIT THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO IDENTIFIED THAT THAT MIGRANT BECAUSE THERE ARE OVERWHELMED OR JUST LACKED THE RESOURCES TO DO SO
IN ONE GREEK ISLAND FOR EXAMPLE AT LEAST THIRTY BODIES HAVE BEEN KEPT IN A FREE SELF INTEREST LAST YEAR OF THE COUNCIL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BURY THEM MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SPACE

THE SUN NEWSPAPER THIS MORNING USES THE WORD SURRENDER TO DESCRIBE HOW THE PRIME MINISTER HAD TO GIVE IN TO THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR AFTER THE PAPER SAYS SHE SABOTAGED HIS PLAN TO NEGOTIATE AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON MIGRANTS THE STORIES BASED ON CLAIMS MADE BY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HE RECENTLY RESIGNED AS WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IT COMES AS BOTH THE TELEGRAPH AND TIMES PUBLISHED LETTERS FROM FORMER NATO SECRETARY GENERALS AND SENIOR AMERICAN FIGURES WARNING
AGAINST BRECK'S IT WELL WE'RE JOINED BY OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA COONS BERG AND LAURA LET'S GET THE KICK OFF ON THESE COMMENTS FROM IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHO SUGGESTS THAT THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON E.U. MIGRATION RATHER THAN E.U. BENEFITS WHICH IS WHAT ENDED UP IN THERE IN A FINAL SPEECH UNTIL THE MIDNIGHT HOUR
INDEED SIR AND JUST IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T REALISED THIS CAMPAIGN WAS GOING TO BE INTENSE AND BRIE TILL THE NOTHING WAS OUT OF BOUNDS WELL ALONG COMES THESE ACCUSATIONS FROM IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WE JUST SPIN BACK A BIT REMEMBER THE PRIME MINISTER DIDN'T JUST WANT A REFERENDUM HE WANTED A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. HE STARTED OFF WANTING TO LIMIT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO CAN COME HERE ONE IDEA WAS THIS EMERGENCY BRAKE ON THE ACTUAL NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ALLOWED TO COME TO THE COUNTRY FOR THE REST OF THE Y. YOU NOW IT WAS WIDELY KNOWN
THAT THE GERMANS JUST WERE NOT UP FOR THAT IDEA REMEMBER THIS WAS A NEGOTIATION HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GET OTHER COUNTRIES ON BOARD WHAT IS INTERESTING THIS MORNING AND TELLS US A LOT ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN IS THAT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS FOR THE FIRST TIME I'VE GONE ON THE RECORD PRESENTING THIS IS SOME KIND OF SURRENDER TO GERMAN CONTROL GIVING HIS VERSION WARTS AND ALL OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BEHIND THE SCENES AND I KNOW I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL MINISTERS WHO WERE PRETTY CROSS ABOUT THE FACT THIS INITIAL
CAME FROM THE PRIME MINISTER WAS DROPPED NOTABLE THAT NUMBER TEN I'M NOT QUITE DENYING IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S VERSION OF EVENTS THIS MORNING WHAT THEY SAYING INSTEAD IS DAVID CAMERON JUST DECIDED THERE WAS A BETTER WAY OF DOING THIS BUT AS I SAY IT WAS WIDELY KNOWN THAT GERMANY HAD VERY GRAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS PLAN AND THEY JUST WOULDN'T HAVE LET IT HAPPEN AS OTHER COUNTRIES PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE EITHER
BUT THIS TELLS US THAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WANTS TO GET THEIR RENEGOTIATION BACK IN PLAY IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND IT ALSO TELLS US OF THE BAD BLOOD INSIDE THE TORY PARTY OVER ALL OF THIS NOW IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IS WILLING TO SPILL THE SECRETS OF THE CABINET WHEN HE WAS IN THERE IT TELLS US THAT NOTHING IS OUT OF BOUNDS AND WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM HIM TODAY WHEN HE'S GIVING A SPEECH AS PART OF THE CAMPAIGN WELL HUGH WILL MAKE WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS THIS SOCIAL JUSTICE CASE FOR LEAVING THE E.U.
BASICALLY SAYING THAT THE POORER LOSE OUT MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IMMIGRATION MEANS TO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME TO THIS COUNTRY BUT THAT'S WHAT'S SO INTERESTING ABOUT THIS AS YOU SAY IF YOU SPIN BACK IT WAS LONG BEFORE THEY WENT TO BRUSSELS OR THAT THERE WERE ARGUMENTS THAT LOOK BECAUSE OF THE THE IMPORTANCE TO THE REST OF THE E.U. OVER FREE MOOD OF MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO GET THAT HENCE THEY WERE FOCUSING ON THE BENEFITS THE FINANCIAL SIDE OF THINGS
INDEED MEAN SOMETHING WHEN IT'S A RENEGOTIATION IT MEANS THAT THERE HAS TO BE AN ELEMENT OF REALPOLITIK ABOUT THIS DAVID CAMERON STARTED WITH A BIG SET OF GOALS THAT WERE SPELT OUT IN THE OFTEN QUOTED BLOOMBERG SPEECH OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ONE OF THE REALITIES BUT ALSO THE DIFFICULTIES OF BEING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET MORE THAN TWENTY OTHER COUNTRIES ROUND A TABLE TO AGREE WITH YOU SO WHAT DOWNING STREET WOULD SAY THAT IN THE END HE DID ACHIEVE SOMETHING
HAS CHANGED OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION OF COURSE THE OTHER SIDE WOULD SAY IT'S MARGINAL IT'S HARDLY MADE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL BUT I DO YOU THINK IN THE NEXT COMING WEEKS IN THE SIX WEEKS THAT WE'VE GOT LESS THAN THIS CAMPAIGN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THE OUTERS WANTED TO RETURN TO THIS IT'S YOU WITH THE RENEGOTIATION AND SSPCA SUGGESTING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER FELL SHORT OF WHAT HE ORIGINALLY PROMISED AND WE HAVE LETTERS IN THE TELEGRAPH AND THE TIMES
FROM IN THE TIMES FROM VERY SENIOR U.S. DEFENCE CHIEFS AND FOREIGN SECOND PERFORMERS U.S. SECRETARIES OF STATE SAYING DON'T VOTE FOR BREAKFAST BRETT BREAKFAST DRINKS IT YOU'RE NOT SAYING THAT THAT WOULD BE MY VOTE FOR BRETT WITH DON'T AND DON'T BANK ON THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP SORT OF TAKING ITS PLACE IN THE TELEGRAPH FIVE FORMER NATO CHIEFS SAYING DON'T GIVE SUCCOUR TO THE WEST'S ENEMIES BY VOTING FOR
INDEED IT'S HARD TO OPEN YOUR NEWSPAPERS OR LOOK ONLINE AT THE MOMENT WITHOUT BEING ASSAULTED BY SOME KIND OF INTERVENTION IN THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN WHICH TELLS US HOW INTENSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE FOR THE NEXT FORTY FOUR DAYS I WONDER IF WHAT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE HERE IS A SIMILAR PATTERN THAT WE SAW ON THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT SO DAY BY DAY MORE SENIOR FIGURES FROM THE THE WORLD'S ESTABLISHMENT THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE COMING OUT AND SUGGESTING THAT WE WOULD BE CRAZY TO WANT TO LEAVE
THAT'S WHAT WE SAW ON THE ECONOMICS I FEEL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE ON FOREIGN POLICY TOO WERE STARTING TO SEE A SIMILAR KIND OF LINE UP IS OF COURSE WORTH SAYING THESE KINDS OF CLAIMS A DISPUTED THEY ARE A MATTER OF OPINION BUT CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF THE ROLL CALL THE AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY ESTABLISHMENT FIVE FORMER NATO SECRETARIES GENERAL IN TERMS OF THE THE CAST LIST OF THAT WHICH THE
IN CAMPAIGN IS PUTTING FORWARD TO BACK THEIR ARGUMENTS THEY'RE CLEARLY TRYING TO CREATE A SORT OF SENSE THAT THE WEIGHT OF OPINION IS VERY VERY MUCH ON THEIR SIDE AND ALL OF THIS SHOWS US HOW INTENSE THIS CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO BE THIS HE'S BEEN CALLED THE SHORT CAMPAIGN FORTY FOUR DAYS TO GO LABOUR IS LAUNCHING HIS CAMPAIGN TODAY WE'RE GOING TO SEE JEREMY CORBIN OUT WITH THE LABOUR EUROPEAN BATTLE BUS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE ARE ABSOLUTELY IN THE THRUSH HAVE THIS MAD NORA KINSBERG THANK YOU
THE TIME IS A QUARTER PAST EIGHT JUST OVER A MONTH AGO A BRITISH IRANIAN WOMAN WAS ABOUT TO GET ON A PLANE BACK TO THE U.K. FROM TEHRAN WHERE SHE'D BEEN VISITING HER PARENTS WHEN SHE WAS STOPPED NOW GARY RATCLIFFE WHO WAS TRAVELLING WITH HER TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HAS BEEN DETAINED SINCE THEN HER HUSBAND RICHARD RATCLIFFE IS WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF WHERE SHE IS
WHAT I KNOW SO FAR IS THAT SHE HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN TO CAMERON PROVINCE WHICH IS IN THE SOUTH OF IRAN ABOUT A THOUSAND KILOMETRES FROM WHERE HER PARENTS LIVE AND WHERE THE AIRPORT IS AND THERE SHE'S BEING KEPT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
AND HE'S BEING INTERROGATED I OCCASIONALLY ON AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IS OF NATIONAL SECURITY
NATIONAL SECURITY AND IT HAS SHE BEEN POLITICALLY ACTIVE SHE HASN'T BEEN POLITICALLY ACTIVE EVER SHE IS A CHARITY WORKER SHE WORKS FOR AN ORGANISATION CALLED THE THOMPSON WRITERS FOUNDATION WHICH IS THE CHARITABLE PART OF REUTERS
SHE HAS BEEN A CHARITY WORKER ALWAYS WHEN SHE AT WHEN SHE WAS LIVING IN AROUND BEFORE SHE CAME OVER HERE TO STUDY AND WE MET SHE WORKED FOR THE RED CROSS AND FOR THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION
SO SHE'S NOT POLITICAL SHE'S A MUM WITH A BABY COS GROWING UP NOW YEAH SO IT'S UTTERLY MYSTIFYING WHY SOMEONE WHO SHE'S JUST THE FIRST TIME SHE'S BEEN OVER TO IRAN
I THINK THE BABY WAS BORN AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO MAKE YOU THINK ON PREVIOUS VISITS THAT THERE MIGHT BE THAT THE AUTHORITIES MIGHT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH HER NOTHING ON ANY PREVIOUS VISIT NO
NOT AT ALL AND HAVE YOU FORMALLY BEEN TOLD THAT SHE'S UNDER INVESTIGATION ON NATIONAL NO I HAVEN'T BEEN FORMALLY TOLD ANYTHING WHAT HER FATHER HAS BEEN TELEPHONED BY SOMEONE FROM THE SUPER THE VERY REVOLUTIONARY GUARD AND HE SAID THAT SHE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND INVESTIGATION COULD TAKE A NUMBER OF MONTHS AND HAS ANYONE MANAGED TO SPEAK TO HER DIRECTLY AT SO SHE HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO
IT TO SPEAK HOME NOT AT HER FAMILY HOME AND WITH SOMEONE STANDING NEXT TO HER ON THE DAYS WHEN SHE'S INTERROGATED IF SHE'S BEEN CO OPERATIVE SO
IT'S HARD TO KNOW IF THERE ARE DAYS WHERE SHE WASN'T COOPERATIVE AND THEN WASN'T ABLE SPEAK BUT SHE LAST CALLED HER FAMILY ON TUESDAY OF LAST WEEK AND HOW DID SHE SOUND WELL IT ONLY HIS WORK DID THE CONVERSATIONS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME THAT SHE WILL SAY SHE IS SHE'S SAFE AND SHE'S HELPING THEM IN INVESTIGATIONS AND THERE IS A SMALL PROBLEM AND SHE HAS SIGNED A STATEMENT AND I MADE A SMALL MISTAKE AND SHE'S HAD A NICE LUNCH
AND SHE HOPES IT WILL BE OVER SOON BUT YOU ARE YOU YOU'RE WORRIED YOU YOU HAPPY UP YOU'RE CHOOSING TO SPEAK PUBLICLY AFTER A MONTH OF IT IS UTTERLY TERRIFYING I MEAN I THINK AT THE BEGINNING WE HAVE AND I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS A MISTAKE AND DEVICE WHICH WASN'T UNREASONABLE WAS TO LOOK THIS COULD ALL BLOW OVER AND IT AND IT COULD BE THAT THEY'VE PICKED HER UP BECAUSE I THINK SHE SOMETHING THAT SHE ISN'T AND AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS THAT WILL GO
AND IT SORT OF ONLY REALLY HIT ME I THINK WHEN I REALISED THAT SHE WAS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DISCHARGES CREST AND
OH THE CHARGES IN THE OFFING THERE ARE NO CHARGES PRESSED AND THAT IT WAS IT WAS TIME TO DO SOMETHING AND ARE YOU WELL AND YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING AGAINST THE ADVICE OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE DO THEY SAY TO YOU THAT ACTUALLY WOULD BE BETTER YOU'D BE BETTER OFF KEEPING QUIET THE FOREIGN OFFICE SAID IT WAS IT WAS A FAMILY'S DECISION BUT THEY SAID THAT IN THEIR EXPERIENCE THEIR OWN AUTHORITIES DIDN'T RESPOND WELL TO PUBLIC PRESSURE
AND THAT THERE WERE THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE BEHIND THE SCENES AND I'M SURE THERE ARE STILL MORE THAT CAN BE DONE BY THE GOVERNMENT WANT MOVED IT FOR ME WAS I SPOKE TO OTHER FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN THROUGH A SIMILAR SITUATION AND EVERY SINGLE ONE SAID THEY WISH THEY'D GONE PUBLIC
AND THAT SORT OF FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE JUST FELT THAT WAS A SENSIBLE THING TO DO I MENTIONED AT THE START THAT SHE WAS TRAVELLING WITH YOUR DAUGHTER SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENED HER AT THE AIRPORT AT THE POINT THAT YOUR WIFE WAS TAKEN AWAY SO SHE WAS TAKEN WITH WITH BOTH HAVE ALL THE DOCUMENTS GABRIELLA'S PASSPORT AND ALL HER OWN TRAVEL DOCUMENTS AND GABRIELLA WAS GIVEN BACK TO HER GRANDPARENTS TO LESLEY'S MOTHER SO GABRIELLA'S CURRENTLY STAYING WITH HER WITH HER GRANDPARENTS IN TEHRAN
YEAH AND OBVIOUSLY HASN'T SEEN HER MUM FOR A VERY LONG TIME I SHOULD SAY US HAVING GONE PUBLIC YESTERDAY AND THE SORT OF THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT WE RECEIVED WE STARTED A PETITION ON CHANGED AT AUG WHICH HAS GOT OVER FORTY THOUSAND SIGNATURES IN THE FIRST DAY WHICH WAS JUST
PHENOMENAL FACTS FOR US AND FOR HER FAMILY BACK AND AROUND BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS HAPPENED THIS HER AND HER FAMILY HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT I'VE BEEN PROMISED A VISIT THOUGHT TO SEE THEIR TO SEE NOTHING SO THEY'RE GOING DOWN I HAVE FOR WEDNESDAY TOMORROW WITH A PROMISE VISIT SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HAPPEN SO IT'S A THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR ALL THEIR PART IN THAT RICHARD RATCLIFFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT WHEN IS IT LEGAL TO KILL SOMEONE IN A DRONE STRIKE A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S HAS WARNED THE GOVERNMENT IT NEEDS URGENTLY TO CLARIFY THE LAW
A BRITISH MAN FROM CARDIFF FRED KAHN WAS KILLED IN A DRONE STRIKE AND SYRIA LAST SUMMER BEFORE PARLIAMENT HAD VOTED THAT MILITARY ACTION COULD BE EXTENDED THERE FROM IRAQ
THE GOVERNMENT INITIALLY SAID THE KILLING WAS NECESSARY TO DEAL WITH A SPECIFIC TERRORIST THREAT THE LATER JUSTIFIED IT AS PART OF ARMED CONFLICT A REPORTER SEEM A DETECTOR SPOKE TO A MAN WHO CONTROLS DRONES IN AFGHANISTAN HE ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS SO HIS WORDS ARE VOICED BY ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS AND SEEMA STARTED BY ASKING WHAT HIS JOB INVOLVED
MY JOB WAS AS A JOINT TERMINAL AIR CONTROLLER THAT INVOLVED HITTING TARGETS FROM AIR PLATFORM SUCH AS DRONES AND JETS I HITTING DIFFERENT TARGETS SUCH AS VEHICLES COMPOUNDS OR INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS THE TALLY
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE TARGETS ARE THEN I MEAN WHO DO YOU CONSULT YOU CAN GET VARIOUS TYPES OF INTELLIGENCE SUCH AS HUMAN INTELLIGENCE SIGNAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH COMES FROM ALL SORTS OF AGENCIES YOU CAN HAVE EYES ON THE GROUND YOU CAN PULL IN ANY NUMBER OF INTELLIGENCE FEEDS TO BUILD UP A TARGET PICTURE THERE OR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHO ASSESS THAT PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE FOR THEIR RELIABILITY THEY MAY BE IMAGE ANALYSTS OR LINGUISTS AND THEN YOU BUILD THE TARGET IN YOUR MIND
WHEN IT COMES TO STRIKING YOU ABIDE BY THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT SO YOUR RULES OF ENGAGEMENT CHANGED DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE AND THE TYPE OF THREAT THAT YOU FACE
SO WHAT DO YOU DO IF THE MISSION CHANGES FOR EXAMPLE IF IT GOES FROM RECONNAISSANCE TO CARRYING OUT A STRIKE ANY OPERATION CAN CHANGE IF YOU BECOME COMPROMISED EVERYTHING IS DICTATED BY THE ENEMY ON THE GROUND AND WHAT THE ENEMY DOES IF IT PRESENTS A THREAT THAN THE SITUATION WILL CHANGE THE WHOLE PROCESS IS CHECKED EVERY STAGE AND HE GOES THROUGH LAWYERS
IT'S A ROBUST PROCESS AND ALWAYS LEANS AGAINST CARRYING OUT A STRIKE FOR THE FEAR OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE HER TARGET
YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT TAKING A LIFE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT GETTING THEIR SUMS RIGHT GETTING YOUR COMMANDS RIGHT FOCUSING ON THE TARGET WHAT DO YOU THINK THE WEAPON WILL DO TO THEIR TARGET
DURING YOUR FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES YOU DO THINK ABOUT KILLING SUPPER BUT AFTER THAT YOU JUST WANT TO GET IT RIGHT SO YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT
HAVE YOU EVER FELT UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE DOING
NO ULTIMATELY IT'S MY CONSCIENCE AND MY NAME ON THE BOMB I WOULD NEVER ENGAGE A TARGET UNLESS I WAS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT
YOU KIND OF TOUCHED ON THIS ALREADY BUT WHAT MEASURES DID YOU TAKE ALL TAKEN TO AVOID CIVILIAN CASUALTIES BUT AS I SAID BEFORE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE WE TRY AND AVOID ANY COMPOUND DAMAGE WHATSOEVER
DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID AND THE LIVES THAT YOU TOOK NO NEVER NEVER
SEEN A PROTECTOR SPEAKING TO A MAN WHO CONTROLS DRONES IN FROM HERE BUT THE DRONES IN AFGHANISTAN AND WE JOINED IN A SHEFFIELD STUDIO BY DOCTOR ALEXANDER LEVELLING HOUSE WHO'S THE AUTHOR OF ETHICS AND AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS AND ALSO JOINED BY DOCTOR PETER LEE WHO'S A LECTURER AT PORTSMOUTH UNIVERSITY IN MILITARY ETHICS NEED TEACHES AT THE R.A.F. COLLEGE IN CRAM WELL GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH
STILL TO BE NOT TO BE SILLY IS IT CLEAR WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN ON WHAT IS AND ISN'T LEGAL WITH DRONES I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT IN AFGHANISTAN IT WAS VERY CLEAR WHAT THE LINE I THINK IN SYRIA COULD BE IT'S VERY
LES AND DOCTOR LEATHERING HOUSE FOR YOU IS IT IS IT CLEAR AND DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT YES I MEAN DEPENDS OBVIOUSLY ON THE LEGAL SITUATION MY BEAR ASSAULTS AN ETHICAL POINT TO BE MADE I'M NOT A LAWYER I'M AN ETHICIST AND AGAIN FOR ME THE OVERRIDING ETHICAL QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT ESTE MADE SURE FOR THREAT THAT PARTIES ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE
RIGHT BUT DOCTOR LEE FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT WASN'T CLEAR LAST SUMMER COULD YOU SEE A SITUATION IN WHICH AT SOME POINT DOWN THE LINE WHOEVER TARGETED RAYER KHAN LAST SUMMER COULD BE PURSUED IN A COURT
WOULD BE IT'D BE A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE INDIVIDUAL RECORD TO TRIGGER BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS GIVEN LEGAL ORDER AND END IN THE MILITARY ONE OF THE KEY THINGS IS ALL BEING LEGAL ORDERS ARE DISOBEYING LEGAL ORDER SO IF YOU WERE GIVEN ILLEGAL ARE BURNED WOULD BE THAT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC BUT IF YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
BUT I DON'T LIKE YOUR RULES OF ENGAGEMENT BUT THE INTERESTING THING HERE IS WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD HARRIET HARMAN SAYING EARLIER THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION IS CONFUSED AND CONFUSING THEY NEED TO URGENTLY CLEAR UP THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK BECAUSE IT'S EXACTLY THAT QUESTION AS TO WHETHER IT IS LEGAL
BUT BUT BUT IT WAS UNCLEAR SHE'S NOT A FINGER AT THE EVENTUAL STATEMENT AND SHE SHE DID FAVOURITE THAT REALLY ACCEPTED YOU'RE MISTAKEN
WE GOT DOCTOR ALEXANDER LEMMING HOUSE YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT AS AN YOU'RE AN ETHICIST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN RAISED THIS MORNING IS THAT THE AMERICANS OF COURSE CARRY MANY MORE DRONE STRIKES AND IN AREAS WHERE WE ARE NOT IN AND YOU WOULDN'T CALL IT AN ARMED CONFLICT ZONE FOR EXAMPLE LIBYA AND IT MAY BE AND IN MANY CASES WE DO PROVIDE THEM WITH INTELLIGENCE
ARE WE THEREFORE RESPONSIBLE IF WE PROVIDE INTELLIGENCE OR FOR EXAMPLE WITH SAUDI ARABIA IF WE ARE HELPING WITH TARGETING AND BECAUSE IT'S BRITISH WEAPONRY ARE WE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS WELL I MEAN THERE MIGHT BE AN ELEMENT OF COMPLICITY OF CERTAINLY ONE I WOULD SAY THIS OF CAUSES
THAT EVEN HAVE PARTIES ARE NOT ARMED CONFLICT IT MAY BE PERMISSIBLE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO USE FORCE AGAINST PARTICULAR TARGET BUT IN SO FAR AS THE LAW'S CONCERNED THAT WOULD BE REGULATED BY INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND YOU HAVE THE RESTRICTIONS WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW SO YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ON THE KIND OF CONFUSION UNDER WHICH FRAMEWORK SUCH STRONG STROKES MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED WHETHER THOSE TRIKES ALMONDY TAKEN PLACE UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW IN ARMED CONFLICT OR ODD TIME OF AN ARMED CONFLICT AND COULD POTENTIALLY BE REGULATED BY INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW OH KAY A DOCTOR FROM WHAT HARRIET HARMAN SAID EARLIER BUT IT WASN'T JUST THE LEGALITY OF THE DECISION MAKING ON THIS IT WAS ALSO THE INDEPENDENT SCRUTINY AFTERWARDS IN THOSE CASES AND THAT HE'S MISSING ISN'T IT
WEAPONS RELEASE FROM CORK ARETHA I CAN SPEAK TO THE AMERICAN PRACTICE BUT EVERY TIME I'VE GOT TO GIVE ME A WEAPON IF RELIEF THEN QUICKLY JOKE THAT IS IS IT LIKE HEY UP THERE UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND AND REVIEW THE NUMBER OF LEVELS INCLUDING WITH WITH LEGAL REVIEWS SO I DO UNDERSTAND THE CRITICISM OF IT'S STILL HAPPENS WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN IS IT HOT POINT IS
BEAKER ALLOWED SOMEONE ELSE TO SCRUTINISE HOW IT USES THESE WEAPONS BECAUSE IF IT GET MADE PUBLIC THEN IF THE ENEMY AND ALSO A WEAPON SYSTEM AND THEN IT CAN AVOID IT MORE EASILY SO THAT THEIR ARGUMENTS AND BOTH BASICALLY AND IN THE GOVERNMENT AT THE MOMENT IS STICKING WITH THIS CRICKET IT WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE BUT WHAT IT'S CLEARLY NOT A DEPENDENT NO NO IT'S NOT
DOCTOR PETER LEAD UP TO ALEXANDER LEMMING HAS THANK YOU THANK YOU THE TIME IS NEARLY HALF HOPPER STATE AND GARY'S HERE WITH THE SPORT AFTER ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE YEARS WEST HAM UNITED PLAY THEIR FINAL MATCH AT UPTON PARK THIS EVENING WHEN MANCHESTER UNITED AT THE VISITORS THERE'S SURE TO BE A FANTASTIC ATMOSPHERE HAD A GRAND THAT STAGE SO MANY MEMORABLE MATCHES FEATURING WELL SOME FANTASTIC PLAYERS

THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER AND LEAVE CAMPAIGNER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS ACCUSE DAVID CAMERON OF DROPPING A KEY DEMAND FROM HIS Y. YOU RE NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE GERMANY THREATENED TO VETO IT HE'S TOLD THE SUN THAT BERLIN REFUSED TO SANCTION AN EMERGENCY BRAKE AND MIGRATION AFTER GERMAN OFFICIALS WERE GIVEN AN ADVANCE COPY OF MISTER CAMERON SPEECH DOWNING STREET SAYS MISTER CAMERON DECIDED HIMSELF THAT AN EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY FORWARD
FIVE FORMER SECRETARIES GENERAL OF NATO AND THIRTEEN SAID SENIOR FIGURES FROM EVERY QUITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SO THE U.K. WILL LOSE INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD IF VOTERS UP TO LEAVE THE E.U. EUROSCEPTIC SEE THEIR VIEWS ARE FROM A DIFFERENT ERA
A CROSS PARTY GROUP OF M.P.S HAS URGED THE GOVERNMENT TO CLARIFY THE LEGAL CASE FOR THE USE OF UNMANNED DRONE STRIKES AGAINST SUSPECTED TERRORISTS THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS SAYS IT RAISED CONCERNS FOLLOWING THE KILLING AND SYRIA LAST YEAR OF A BRITISH CITIZEN BY A REMOTELY CONTROLLED R.A.F. PLAYING THE GOVERNMENT SAYS SUCH ACTIONS HAVE TAKEN ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW
POLICE IN GERMANY SAY A KNIFE ATTACK ON COMMUTERS THERE'S A TRAIN STATION EAST OF MUNICH THIS MORNING MAY HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY MOTIVATED MEDIA REPORTS SUGGEST THAT FRASERS AND ARABIC WAS SHOUTED DURING THE ASSAULT SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN INJURED A MAN'S BEEN ARRESTED WELL LET'S GET MORE ON THAT STORY NOW AT TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE REPORTS IN THE JA IN GERMAN MEDIA THAT A MAN HAS DIED AND SEVERAL INJURED AFTER A MAN WENT ON A KNIFE RAMPAGE JENNY HILL AS A CORRESPONDENT IN GERMANY AND JENNY WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

WHO ATTACKED THE THE THE RAIL PASSENGERS AND REPORTEDLY SHOUTED ALLAHU AKBAR AS HE DID SO HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND THE PROSECUTORS HAVE INSTITUTED A MEDIA BLACKOUT WHICH MEANS IT'S RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF ANY DETAILS BEYOND THAT AT THE MOMENT CLEARLY THE IDEA THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN SOME TERROR INSPIRED ATTACK PERHAPS CARRIED OUT BY SOMEONE WITH LEANINGS TOWARDS THE TERROR GROUP AT THE TOP OF EVERYONE'S SUSPICION
GERMANY FOR SOME TIME ACCORDING TO SENIOR SECURITY OFFICIALS HAS BEEN AND I QUOTE IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF INTERNATIONAL TERROR ALTHOUGH OF COURSE GENERALLY HASN'T YET SUFFERED A MAJOR TERROR ATTACK LIKE WE'VE SEEN IN PARIS OR BRUSSELS IN RECENT DAYS THAT OF COURSE IS THE SUSPICION THIS MORNING BUT AS YET DETAILS ARE VERY SKETCHY AND THOUGH AS I SAY WE DO NOW HAVE MEDIA REPORTS THAT THAT MY MAN HAS DIED AND YOU SAY THAT THERE WAS A MEDIA BLACKOUT HOW THEY'D TRYING TO ARRANGE THAT
THIS HAS JUST COME TO ME IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES THAT THE PROSECUTOR'S INVESTIGATING THIS CASE OF AN INSTITUTE OF THIS MEDIA BLACKOUT AND IF I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE DETAILS AS YET WE DO KNOW THAT THE POLICE SAID THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO CONFIRM THIS MAN'S BACKGROUND WHETHER HE WAS A KNOWN IS MISSED FOR EXAMPLE BUT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THAT PARTICULAR LINE OF ENQUIRY AND AS I SAY IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES PROSECUTORS HAVE SAID THAT THEY WON'T BE REVEALING ANY MORE DETAILS JENNY HILL THANKS
THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO DIED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN HAD BEEN BURIED IN UNMARKED GRAVES IN GREECE TURKEY AND ITALY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THE FIGURES EMERGED FROM A B.B.C. INVESTIGATION LOOKING AT MORE THAN SEVENTY SITES IN THE THREE COUNTRIES THE BODIES OF SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE DIED TRYING TO REACH EUROPE HAD NEVER BEEN FOUND BUT OTHERS ARE WASHED ASHORE WERE HIGH AND REPORTS FROM THE ISLAND OF LESBOS
A BOAT FULL OF SYRIAN REFUGEES LANDS ON THE GREEK ISLAND OF LESBOS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN TRAUMATISED BY THE JOURNEY BREAKDOWN AS THEY TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ONTO THE BEACH HELPED BY VOLUNTEERS FROM ALL OVER
NO ONE ON THIS BOAT DROWNED BUT ONE MAN WAS CRUSHED TO DEATH ON BOARD ANOTHER DIED OF A HEART ATTACK WHEN HE SET FOOT ON LAND THERE WAS ONE CONSOLATION FOR THIS SURVIVING RELATIVES THEY WERE TRAVELLING WITH PEOPLE WHO COULD IDENTIFY THEM
THE MIGRANT CEMETERY IN LESBOS AT FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER OLIVE GROVE ON THE GREEK ISLAND BUT IN THE CLEARING IN THE TREES ARE DOZENS OF GRAPES
MOST OF THE SEVENTY MIGRANTS BURIED HERE ARE ONLY IDENTIFIED BY HIM
THEY ARE PREPARED FOR BURIAL BY MUSTAPHA AND EGYPTIAN WHO LIVES IN LESBOS BUILT SORT OF THEM SOMETHING
I TAKE THE BODY FROM THE HOSPITAL AND BRING IT HERE I WASH IT RABBIT WITH A SPECIAL CLOTH PRIORY AND PREPARE THE GRAVE I LAY THE BODY FACING MECCA I PUT WOOD ON TOP NORMALLY SHOULD PUT STONES BUT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SO I USE WOULD THEN A CLOSER GRAVE AND DO THE LAST PRAYER
THE B. B. C. HAS FOUND THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN SEVENTY BURIAL SITES FOR UNIDENTIFIED MIGRANTS ACROSS GREECE ITALY AND TURKEY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED TRYING TO REACH EUROPE
THOSE BODIES WERE FOUND AT LEAST ONE IN SEVEN HAS BEEN BURIED IN AN UNMARKED GRAVE IF
BUT TROY FOR RUPERT CARTER HAS BEEN TRYING TO FIND HIS NEPHEWS FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS
HIS BROTHER AND WIFE DIED WHEN THEIR BOAT CAPSIZED LAST YEAR OFF LES BOSS BUT THE BODIES OF THEIR FOUR CHILDREN WERE NEVER FOUND SOMEONE HE HAS TRAVELLED ACROSS TURKEY AND GREECE HOPING TO FIND EITHER PROOF OF LIFE OR AT LEAST A D.N.A. MATCH WITH ANY OF THE UNIDENTIFIED BODIES OF THE MANY CHILDREN BURIED IN BOSS
HE HAS HAD TO SELL HIS HOME AND AFGHANISTAN IN ORDER TO FINANCES
HE SPOKE TO THE B. B. C. FROM CUPBOARD MAMBI FIT HIM COS THEY'VE GONE IN YOURS AND DAY ON WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO FIND OUT IF THEY'RE ALIVE OR DEAD IF YOU'RE ALIVE IT WOULD BE THE BEST THING FOR THE WHOLE OF GOD FORBID THEIR DEAD BUT IF WE FIND THEM AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE RESTING IN PEACE SOMEWHERE WE'VE LOST SIX MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY OUR LIFE AND FAMILY ARE BROKEN
WE CAME TO THIS HOSPITAL ON THE GREEK ISLAND OF SAINT MOSS BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST FOUND THE BODIES OF TWO MIGRANTS ON THE SHORE
ONE WAS AN ADULT THE OTHER A CHILD IT IS THOUGHT THEY'VE BEEN AT SEA FOR WEEKS UNTIL A FISHERMAN FOUND
NO ONE KNOWS YET WHO THESE MIGRANTS
BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF BODIES FOUND BY THE GREEK AUTHORITIES THEY'VE HAD TO BRING IN CONTAINERS WHERE THE BODY STAY FOR DAYS WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS
THERE ISN'T THE CORONER SO THEY HAVE TO FLY IN THEODORA WILL SEE US FROM THE NEARBY ISLAND OF LESBOS IN THE LAST YEAR HE HAS DEALT WITH DOZENS OF UNIDENTIFIED BODIES UP HIS SINS IN THIS PLACE
SOMETIMES I RECEIVE A CALL FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER MISSING SOMETIMES THEY COME TO THE HOSPITAL SEE PHOTOGRAPHS AND SEE WHETHER THEY CAN IDENTIFY THEM THROUGH PHOTOS WHICH IS THE FIRST STEP THEN THEY SEND THEIR OWN D.N.A. SAMPLE TO THE LAB TO SEE WHETHER THERE WILL BE A D.N.A. MATCH
IF THE BODIES ARE IDENTIFIED THEY REMAIN FOR SOME TIME HERE IN THE FRIDGE UNTIL THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ORDER IS ISSUED FOR THE BURIAL AND THEN THEY ARE BURIED
ON EUROPEAN SHORES LIKE HERE IN LESBOS VOLUNTEERS KEEP WATCH FOR INCOMING BOATS
THEY HELP PEOPLE OFF THE BOATS THEY'VE ALSO BEEN TRYING TO HELP THOSE WITH MISSING RELATIVES TAKING THEM TO BURY SITES AND USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO SPEED UP THE SEARCH FOR INFORMATION
IN ARRIVED AS A REFUGEE TO LESBOS OVER A DECADE AGO AFTER CROSSING FROM TURKEY IN A PEDAL
HE'S NOW ONE OF THE VOLUNTEERS HELPING THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR THEIR RELATIVES THERE IS A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THIS
THERE ARE CASES THAT GIVEN THE OTHER LOT
ONLY THING THE YOU KNOW THE DISTORTED FROM TURKEY AND THEN EVERYTHING
EVERYBODY'S PAYING ATTENTION TO THE RIFF WAS USED FOR MAKING ALIVE TO YOU OVER TO GREECE BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DRAWING I SING WITH A FEW PEOPLE
BECAUSE HER IN THE BOAT IS NO DEBT HAD THIS FOR THE MISSING PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WHO WERE DROWNED AND THIS WAY
TO AFGHAN COMMUNITY IN ASSES TWO PEOPLE PASSED FROM HERE AND THEY KNOW ME WE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THEIR FAMILIES ARE RELATED
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FEMINISM

TO STAY IN BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE REFORMED IT WON'T REFORM SO I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE POWER THAT IT HAS SO YOU THINK A VOTE WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF HOLDING A GUN TO THE EAVES HAD TO FORCE IT
I THINK POLAND AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NOW GETTING UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THE POWER TO WIELD THAT AND I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE A SHOT IN THE ACROSS THE BOW TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH DOESN'T SOUND VERY PRINCIPLED
PRINCIPLES ARE O.K. AT TIMES HOW DO YOU MEAN UNPRINTABLE WELL I MEAN YOU'RE NOT REALLY FOR OUT ARE YOU YOU JUST WANT TO REFORM
I WOULD IDEA THAT WOULD BE THE IDEAL THING BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO REFORM SO OUT IS THE ONLY OPTION
GERALD WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT AS AN ARGUMENT I THINK IT WOULD BE FOOLISH NOT TO REMAIN IN THE
THE TREASURY TELLS US THAT EVERY FAMILY IN THIS COUNTRY IS LIKELY TO LOSE FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. THAT FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POUNDS BELONGS IN WHITBY WHITBY LIVES OF TOURISM AND THAT FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED IS GOING TO BE THE DISCRETIONARY
SPENDING THEIR FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY THE SPENDING THAT THEY WERE
THE MONEY THAT I WOULD SPEND IF THEY CAME TO WHITBY TO SEE THE TOUR TO YORKSHIRE FOR THE GOTH WEEKEND MUSIC BOOK OR THE OTHER FINE EVENTS WE HAVE ON THIS TOWN TO INVITE TOURISTS AND GIVE TOURISTS A GREAT HOLIDAY IF THEY LOSE THEIR MONEY
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO COME HERE TO SPEND IT AND THERE'S BEEN QUITE A LOT OF MONEY COMING IN HERE HASN'T IT WHAT DO YOU USE FUNDED QUITE A LOT PROJECTS IN YORKSHIRE
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY GONE INTO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN YORKSHIRE MORE THAN ANY OTHER REGION IN THE E.U. WE'VE ALSO HAD MONEY FOR SCREEN YORKSHIRE WHICH IS ENABLED FILM PRODUCTIONS TO COME TO YORKSHIRE SUCH AS
GONE IMMEDIATELY FEAR OF BRITAIN'S TESTAMENT OF YOUTH EXACTLY CAN I JUST SAY THOUGH THAT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO FISHERMEN HERE THOSE IN THE FISHING COMMUNITY OF THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND THERE IS A REAL ANGER HERE ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL THEY'VE BEEN TREATED BY THE ISSUES LIKE QUOTAS
AND THEY FEEL THAT ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE IN PART FOR DESTROYING THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND THAT'S A VERY STRONG SENTIMENT IN THIS TOWN
IT CERTAINLY IS AND I'VE HAD THAT CONVERSATION MANY TIMES WITH FISHERMEN HERE I'M NOT ALTOGETHER SURE THAT IT'S NECESSARILY TRUE WHEN I HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS I'VE ASKED PEOPLE TO SHOW ME THE E.U. DIRECTIVE THAT TOLD THE HERRING NOT TO COME TO WHITBY AND OF COURSE I CAN'T WHEN I LOOK UP THE HARP HERE OUT OF THE NORTH SEA I SEE QUITE A WELL MANAGED FISHERY WHICH COD STOCKS ARE ACTUALLY GROWING THEIR COD QUOTAS IN WHITBY
HAVE GONE UP THIS YEAR BUT THERE IS REAL ANGER HERE ISN'T THERE JOHN AMONGST FISHING COMMUNITY
IT LOOKS LIKE IT YES IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM AND I THINK THE THINGS LIKE NET SIZES THAT WAS AN OBVIOUS WAY OF CONTROLLING THE BESIDES A FISH BUT NO IT DIRECTED IT SAYS NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHICH WAY THIS TOWN IS GOING TO VOTE JOHN AND GERALD'S OPINION IS THAT WHITBY GOES ITS OWN WAY SO READ INTO THAT WHAT YOU WELL MICHELLE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THOUGH HE CONWAY IN WHITBY WITH A SERIES OF PRE REFERENDUM REPORTS ELEVEN MINUTES TO NINE WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY FOR THOSE GOING BACK INTO CANADIAN TOWNS IN THE PATH OF THE WILDFLOWERS SWEEPING ACROSS THE COUNTRY TOWNS LIKE FORT MCMURRAY IS TO SEE NOT ONLY WHAT'S BEEN DESTROYED BUT ALSO WHAT HAS SURVIVED SOME BUILDINGS STILL STAND SEEMINGLY SCARCELY TOUCHED WHILE THE NEIGHBOUR'S BEEN RAZED TO THE GROUND
AS WE HEARD EARLIER A LOT HAS BEEN LEARNT FROM THE PROGRESS OF THE FIRE WHAT'S LESS OBVIOUS IS THE DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT HOW MUCH CARBONS BEEN CHUCKED UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND WHAT EFFECT WILL IT HAVE WE'RE JOINED BY PROFESSOR MARTIN WORCESTER HE'S PROFESSOR OF EARTH OBSERVATION SCIENCE AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON IS AT THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR EARTH OBS OBSERVATION HE JOINS US FROM READING AND FROM PLYMOUTH DOCTOR DAN BETTER WHO SENIOR LECTURER IN MICROBIAL ECOLOGY AT EXETER UNIVERSITY AND USED TO BE A FORESTRY RESEARCH IN CANADA GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH
MORNING PERHAPS WE SHOULD PUNCH WE SHOULD START WITH THE CARBON PROFESSOR WORCESTER WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT DAMAGE THAT ASPECT OF THE BURNING COURSE
WELL FIRES WHEN THEY KNEW THREE FORESTS LIKE THIS OBVIOUSLY CONSUMING LOTS OF BIOMASS IN THE TREES THEMSELVES ON THE FOREST FLOOR AND AROUND HALF OF THAT BY MASSES IS MADE UP OF CARBON AND ROUGH CALCULATIONS SUGGEST THIS FAR AS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SQUARE KILOMETRES SO FAR AND IT MIGHT HAVE EARNED ABOUT
TEN MILLION TONNES OF C.O.TWO OR PUT TEN MILLION TONNES OF C.O.TWO INTO THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS ROUGHLY THE SAME RATE OF EMISSION AS THE WHOLE OF THE U.K. IT'S BEEN GOING FOR ABOUT TEN DAYS AND IT WOULD HAVE ADMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE THE SAME AMOUNT OF C.O.TWO AS THE U.K. EMITS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND TEN DAYS OVER THAT PERIOD YOU DO YOU THEN HAVE TO ADD ON TO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE LOST TO THESE TREES AND THEIR BENEFIT THEY DO TO THE ENVIRONMENT
WELL THE TREE'S STALL CARBON CLEARLY AS A SAID THEY'RE ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT CARBON AND GROWING TREES OBVIOUSLY ALSO TAKE UP CARBON
BUT SEE SUE AT THE POINT AT WHICH THEY START GROWING AGAIN THERE'S A POSITIVE THAT'S EXACTLY WHEN THESE TREES THEY THINK THE WHOLE TREES WON'T BE BURNED MOST OF THE BIO MASS WILL STILL BE THERE BUT THEY WILL BE KILLED AND OVER TIME THEY WILL
ROT AND BE REPLACED BY NEW GROWING TREES WILL ABSORB MOST OF THAT CARBON DIOXIDE THERE'S BEEN LIMITED BUT THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY OTHER EMISSIONS AS WELL OF OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES AND ALSO AEROSOLS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AS WELL AS CARBON DIOXIDE LET ME BRING UP TO DOWN HERE BECAUSE IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY NOT BUTCHER AS WAS PARTLY THE PATH OF THE FIRE BUT THE EFFECT IT HAS ON DIFFERENT AREAS WE WERE HEARING CAN PEOPLE WILL BE LEARNING AN AWFUL LOT FROM THE SCALE OF THIS WHAT'S HAPPENING
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THIS MUST HAVE BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE FOR THE FOR THE PEOPLE LIVING IN FORT MARIE WE CAN BE THANKFUL THAT APPARENTLY THE DAMAGE TO THE CITY IS LESS THAN IT COULD HAVE BEEN BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT FIRES IN THIS REGION R. A. NATURAL PROCESS AND JUST AS WE BREATHE IN AND OUT OF THE FOREST WILL BURN AND REGENERATE AND FIRES HAVE BEEN PART OF THE HISTORY OF THIS AREA FOR
FOOT THOUGHT FOR MILLENNIA AND IN FACT THE BEFORE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF TWO THOUSAND AND ONE IN NEW YORK THE THE SINGLE MOST DEVASTATING AND DEADLY EVENT FOR YOU S. FIRE FIGHTERS WAS THE THE NINETEEN TEN BLAZING IN MONTANA AND IDAHO AND SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF PUT THIS INTO A HISTORICAL CONTEXT THAT WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH THESE FIRES AND MANAGE THEM AS WE GO AND FIRES ON THIS SCALE I MEAN THIS ISN'T BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN STORING UP PROBLEM BY STOPPING FIRES
WELL THAT IS AN ISSUE INDEED AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH TO SHOW THAT FIRE SUPPRESSION WHILE IT DOES PREVENT FIRES FROM FROM HAPPENING IT DOES ALLOW THE FOREST TOO TO GROW AND TO BUILD UP TO INCREASE WHAT WE CALL THE FUEL LOAD WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF BURNABLE BIOMASS IN THE FOREST AND SO WHEN WHEN FIRES DO EVENTUALLY COME TO AN AREA AND OUR EVENTUALLY IGNITED
THEN THEY CAN BE EVEN MORE POWERFUL AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF IF A NATURAL FIRE CYCLE HADN'T BEEN IN PROCESS O.K. SO YOU ACCEPT THE FIRES WE HAVE FIRE BREAKS WHAT MORE COULD BE DONE TO PROTECT POPULATIONS
CURRENTLY THE BILL FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION IN CANADA IS ABOUT A BILLION U.S. DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS WHICH IS INCREDIBLY HIGH AND I THINK OF IT IN THE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SO MANY LARGE FIRES HAVE TAKEN PLACE THAT THE AUTHORITIES ARE BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH
I CAN BE MANAGED IN A PERHAPS MORE ECO SYSTEM CONSCIOUS WAY SO THAT WE DO ALLOW WILL ALLOW FIRES TO HAPPEN IN CERTAIN AREAS AND WE CAN USE PRESCRIBED BURNS WHICH IS WHERE FIRES ARE SET TO TO REDUCE THE FUEL LOAD IN FORESTS BUT CLEARLY AROUND CITIES
THE KEY THING IS TO REDUCE THE FUEL LOAD IMMEDIATELY AROUND CITIES AND TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO CATCH FIRE AND ARE THEY ALL ARE THEY GOING TO BE MORE COMMON PURELY BECAUSE THE WEATHER IS CHANGING AND GETTING HOTTER WELL THERE DOES SEEM TO BE EVIDENCE THAT
THE ENVIRONMENT HAS WARMED AND HEAT IS AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF FIRE AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS WHICH LEAD TO FIRE
RISK ARE INCREASING AND WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE THE CLIMATE MODELS ARE INDICATING THERE SO WE NEED TO BE READY AND JUST A FINAL THOUGHT FOR US IT WAS TO BE SEEN PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY WITH THE SORT OF FACE GUARDS COVERING THEIR MOUTHS BECAUSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT ALL THE PARTICLES THAT IS AFFAIR IS IT
YES CERTAINLY THESE SMOKE EMITTED BY THESE THESE FIRES IS VERY THICK IN PARTICULATES NOW THE SORT OF ACTIVITY USING CANADA LIKE I GUESS IT'S RELATIVELY SHORT LIVED IN ANY ONE PLACE IF YOU IF YOU THINK BACK TO LAST YEAR THE END OF LAST YEAR THERE WAS TERRIBLE FIRES IN INDONESIA WHICH WHERE IT WAS
PEATLANDS THAT WERE BURNING THAT ACTUALLY RELEASE SMOKE IN HUGE AREAS FOR MONTHS ON END SO IT DEFINITELY HAS A SEVERE IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH SO YOU DON'T WANT TO BREATHE THIS THESE EMISSIONS FOR TOO LONG PROFESSOR MARTIN WORCESTER DOCTOR DAMP EVER THANK YOU
THE TIME IS FIVE TO NINE READING WHAT THE CRITICS SAY IS OFTEN A NERVE WRACKING EXPERIENCE FOR A PERFORMER AND ONE OF THE ROYAL BALLET'S PRINCIPAL DANCERS APPEARS TO HAVE HAD ENOUGH WITH THE CRITIC WHO WAS MADE POINTED REFERENCES TO HIS APPEARANCE ALISTAIR MCAULEY FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS REFERRED TO EDWARD WATSON'S PALE SKIN AND ALBANY
IN NEGATIVE REVIEWS HE'S ALSO CALLED HIS STAGE PERSONA FREAKISH HAD REPORTS NOW COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE TIMES WE'RE JOINED BY DEBORAH BULL FORMER PRINCIPAL DANCER AT THE ROYAL BALLET NOW ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON AND ON THE LINE BY MICHAEL COAD AND WHO'S A THEATRE CRITIC AND AUTHOR GOOD MORNING TO YOU
DEBORAH BULL CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHY EDWARD WATSON WHO IS VERY STRIKING WITH THIS FLAME RED HARE'S ANNOYED ENOUGH ABOUT THIS TO GO PUBLIC I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS A VERY STRIKING ARTIST AND IN MANY WAYS HE HAS BROKEN THE MOULD OF WHAT A MALE DANCER SHOULD BE
IF YOU READ THE ARTICLE IN FACT WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS AS AN ARTIST WHEN YOU GROW UP AND START TO ACCEPT WHO YOU ARE SO IN FACT HE'S SAYING I'VE PUT TO BED MY OWN CONCERNS ABOUT BEING DIFFERENT IT'S A SHAME OTHER PEOPLE HAVEN'T SO IT WAS LESS AN ATTACK ON A PARTICULAR CRITIC MORE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW HE HAS MATURED AS AN ARTIST I THINK HE'S APPROACHING AMAZINGLY HIS FORTIETH BIRTHDAY BUT HE SAID I'M NOT GONNA FEEL BAD ABOUT AT ALL THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT IT SAYING
HE'S STILL THERE WITH HIS HORRIBLE GINGER HAIR AND IT'S HORRIBLE PALE SKIN ALTHOUGH THAT IS NOT EXACTLY IT'S NOT A GREAT EFFORT AND I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING THERE BUT THE POWER OF THE MISSING ADJECTIVE BECAUSE OF COURSE WHEN WE MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE A WHOLE SET OF ASSUMPTIONS ARE HEARD BY THE PERSON IF WE SAY OLD SHE'S BLONDE WELL THERE'S A WHOLE SET OF CULTURAL ASSUMPTIONS
IF WE SAY THE RED HEADED WE THINK ANNE OF GREEN GABLES AND FIERY TEMPERS AND SOUNDS A BIT THERE ARE A WHOLE SET OF ASSUMPTIONS AROUND IT BUT I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING ABOUT HOW A DANCER'S BODY IS PERCEIVED TO ME A DANCER'S BODY IS A TOOL THAT DOES THE JOB OF PORTRAYING A CHARACTER OF CONVEYING THE CHOREOGRAPHER'S INTENTIONS TO THE PUBLIC AND ACTUALLY I THINK CRITICS SOMETIMES CROSS THE LINE BECAUSE THEY SEE THE BODY AS THAT AS AS I MIGHT SEE YOUR BODY TODAY DO I LIKE THE WAY YOUR HAIR LOOKS OR SO ON
WHEREAS THAT'S NOT RELEVANT TO YOUR PUT YOUR PORTRAYAL IN A ROLE MICHAEL COULD NEED YOU DO YOU THINK CRITICS SHOULD BE CAREFULLY YOU MINDFUL WHEN YOU WRITE THINGS ABOUT WHERE IT'S LEGITIMATE COMMENT ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WHERE IT'S JUST RATHER PERSONAL
AND YOU THINK YOU SHOULD IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FINE FOR YOU TO SAY CILLA'S LODGE
AND AND AND WE'RE NOT THE AS WE USED TO BE YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE NO AN AMERICAN CRITIC HEAD OF A U.S. ITALIAN ACTOR CALLED GUIDO NAT NAT THAT EDO THE POOR MAN NEVER WORKED AGAIN AND GUYS REALLY
WELL A HER FUNNY EVEN IF IT DOES IT'S FUNNY
AND HOLIDAY SEASON SO I THINK IT HELPS WHEN YOU CAN GET A WHISK O.K. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME BUT DEBORAH BULL I MEAN FOR A DANCE APPEARANCE IS MORE RELEVANT THAN MY HAIR ON THE RAID AT IN YOUR TELEVISION NO IT DID MICHAEL MAKES THE POINT CAN THE BODY DO THE THING THAT IS ASKED OF IT NOW THAT'S RELEVANT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RELEVANT WHETHER THE HAIR IS RED OR THE SKIN PALE OR EVEN BLACK IS NOT RELEVANT WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH DEBORAH BULL AND MICHAEL COPLEY THANK YOU
