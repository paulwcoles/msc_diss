AND TALK THROUGH WHAT'S UPSET HIM AND I CAN'T I CAN'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER I CAN'T CHANGE IT AND I CAN'T HELP HIM
THE THOUGHTS OF THOSE WHO HAVE GROWN UP SINCE THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT ON HOW MUCH NORTHERN IRELAND HAS CHANGED THE OLDER GENERATION DON'T HAVE TO GO UP IN A TIME WHEN THERE WAS A LOT MORE SEGREGATION THERE WAS A LOT OF VIOLENCE BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES THEY WEREN'T HIS UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT NAE DEPT THE YOUNGER GENERATION MAYBE OR A BIT MORE OPEN MINDED THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CAROLINE NICHOLS
PRINCE WILLIAM HAS DEFENDED HIS COMMITMENT TO HIS ROYAL DUTIES AFTER CRITICISM THAT HE'S NOT BEEN DEVOTING ENOUGH TIME TO HIS RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE B. B. C. INTERVIEW THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE DESCRIBED THE INCREDIBLE INSIGHTS HE'D GAINED FROM OBSERVING THE QUEEN HIS NINETIETH BIRTHDAY IS TOMORROW THE PRINCE SAID HE WAS CONCENTRATING ON HIS YOUNG FAMILY BUT WAS COMPLETELY READY TO TAKE ON A BIGGER ROLE WHEN THE TIME COMES

EIGHT FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARIES HAVE WARNED BRITISH VOTERS THAT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS A BIG RISK WRITING IN THE TIMES THE ONE TIME ECONOMIC ADVISERS TO VARIOUS PRESIDENTS SAY THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP HAS BENEFITED FROM HAVING A STRONG BRITAIN WITHIN EUROPE THEY MADE THEIR INTERVENTION AHEAD OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VISIT TO LONDON LATER THIS WEEK AS IAN WATSON REPORTS FROM WESTMINSTER
IT'S STILL NOT CERTAIN HOW MUCH PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL SAY ABOUT THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE FORMER TREASURY SECRETARIES AREN'T AT ALL WEARY ABOUT ENTERING THE FRAY BIG KNOWLEDGE THE DECISION AND E.U. MEMBERSHIP IS FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE BUT THEN DO ALL THEY CAN TO INFLUENCE IT
THE ONE THAT BREAKS IT COULD CALL INTO QUESTION LONDON'S RULE AS A FINANCIAL CENTRE AND CLAIM AT THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY IS ALREADY HOLDING BACK INVESTMENT FOR IT LEAVE RESPONDED BY SAYING THAT NONE OF THE FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARIES WOULD HAVE GIVEN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MEXICO THEN FITTED IN CHARGE OF AMERICA'S BORDERS BUT THE ASKING BRITAIN TO DO THE EQUIVALENT
A SENIOR DIRECTORATE TATA STEEL IS FORMING A MANAGEMENT BUY OUT TEAM TO START THE PROCESS OF BUILDING TO TAKE OVER THE COMPANY'S U.K. BUSINESS IT'S BELIEVED THE DEAL WOULD INVOLVE STILL MAKING CONTINUING AT PORT TALBOT DESPITE ITS HUGE LOSSES
BRITISH HIKER WHO DISAPPEARED IN THE PERUVIAN ANDES ALMOST A FORTNIGHT AGO HAS BEEN FOUND DEAD THE BODY OF HARRY GREAVES WHO FROM OSWESTRY IN SHROPSHIRE WAS DISCOVERED NEAR A STEEP CLIFF THOMAS SINGLETON REPORTS
HARRY GREAVES HAD LAST BEEN SEEN ON THE SEVENTH OF APRIL TWO DAYS BEFORE HIS TWENTY NINTH BIRTHDAY WHEN HE SET OUT ON HIS SOLO MOUNTAIN HIKE AROUND FIFTY MILES FROM ENTROPY TO PERU'S MOST FAMOUS TOURIST ATTRACTION THE ALARM WAS RAISED WHEN HE FAILED TO RETURN AS EXPECTED THREE DAYS LATER
A SEARCH OPERATION WAS LAUNCHED WHICH MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY JOINT LAST WEEKEND THEIR HOPES HAD BEEN RAISED BY A REPORTED SIGHTING BUT LAST NIGHT THE FAMILY RELEASED A STATEMENT CONFIRMING HOW HE GREETS DEATH THERE THANK THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HELPED FIND HIS BODY
A SURVEY HAS SUGGESTED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND WALES REQUIRING HOSPITAL TREATMENT AFTER BEING ASSAULTED LEVELLED OFF LAST YEAR AFTER A SERIES OF ANNUAL FALLS RESEARCHERS AT CARDIFF UNIVERSITY SO IT COULD MEAN THE LONG TERM TREND OF DECLINING LEVELS OF VIOLENCE IS AT AN END
NEW RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES HELP CHILDREN FROM POORER BACKGROUNDS IN ENGLAND ACHIEVE HIGHER MARKS IN THE CLASSROOM THE STUDY BY THE INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION THAT TAKING PART IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES HELP THEM CATCH UP WITH THOSE FROM MORE AFFLUENT FAMILIES HERE'S OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PEEL
BY THE AGE OF ELEVEN MORE AFFLUENT CHILDREN ARE NORMALLY DOING SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IN TESTS THAN POORER ONES BUT THE STUDY OF MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND CHILDREN IN ENGLAND SUGGESTS THE DISADVANTAGED PUPILS WHO TAKE PART IN TWO AFTER SCHOOL CLUBS A WEEK CUT THAT GAP IN PERFORMANCE BY ALMOST HALF
ITS AUTHOR DOCTOR EMILE TANNER SAID THE IMPROVE PERFORMANCE INCLUDED ACADEMIC SUBJECTS SUCH AS ENGLISH MATHS AND SCIENCE AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT SHE SAID CLUBS WORKED BY IMPROVING PHYSICAL FITNESS AND SOCIAL SKILLS AND BY GIVING CHILDREN AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED WITH FAR REACHING EFFECTS ON THEIR SELF CONFIDENCE
THE U.S. STATE OF UTAH HAS BECOME THE FIRST TO DECLARE PORNOGRAPHY A PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD THE BILL DOESN'T BAN PORNOGRAPHY BUT CALLS FOR GREATER EFFORTS TO PREVENT EXPOSURE AND ADDICTION TO IT
THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST AND THOMAS SHUFFLE I COULD'VE WAITING TO GIVE IT YOU AS MORNING TOM ABSOLUTELY VERY GOOD MORNING TO CHANCER AND EVERYONE ELSE A GREY DAY ON THE WAY TODAY YESTERDAY IT WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING CLEAR BLUE SKIES FOR MANY OF US SPIT OF CLOUD HERE AND THERE AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN TODAY NO IT IS A LITTLE ON THE NIPPY SIDE AT THE MOMENT TEMPERATURES IN MOST MAJOR TOWNS AND CITIES
THIS MORNING ARE BETWEEN ONE AND THREE DEGREES COASTAL AREAS A LITTLE BIT MILDER SEVEN OR EIGHT CELSIUS AND IT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO WARM UP QUITE NICELY AT TODAY SO ALL THAT I HAVE LEFT TO SAY IS THAT ACROSS ENGLAND
WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND THIS MORNING IT'S GOING TO BE BEAUTIFULLY SUNNY SCOTLAND A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOUD AND THEN THIS AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES WILL BE PICKING PROBABLY AROUND FIFTEEN DEGREES FOR MOST OF US BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF AROUND THE SOUTH WEST OF THE MIDLANDS AND THE SOUTH OF WALES WE SCOOP UP TEMPERATURES TO AROUND EIGHTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS SO THAT SHOULD FEEL VERY PLEASANT AS WELL
THE AFTERNOON WILL BE JUST AS SUNNY AS THE MORNING FOR MANY AREAS OF ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND BUT SCOTLAND ONCE AGAIN WILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOUD I THINK THE LOWLANDS WILL BE FINE LOTS OF SUNSHINE HERE BUT THE NORTHERN HALF OF SCOTLAND AT TIMES A LITTLE BIT CLOUDY AND THEN LATER IN THE AFTERNOON THE WINDS WILL BE PICKING UP IN THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND PARTICULARLY COASTAL AREAS OF CORNWALL DEVON AND SOMERSET HERE WE COULD SEE GUSTS OF AROUND FORTY MILES AN HOUR SO THAT DOES MEAN IT IS GOING TO FEEL
A LITTLE ON THE COOL SIDE IF YOU'RE OFF FOR A WALK AND THE WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN INTO THE EVENING HOURS INTO TONIGHT MATCH UP TO GALE FORCE FOR A TIME TOMORROW THERE'S JUST A CHANCE OF A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN IN THE SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND BUT THAT IS A BIT OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME AS TODAY BUT
THOMAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE NUMBER OF THEM NOTABLY THE MALE AND THE TIMES PICK UP ON COMMENTS BY JEAN CLAUDE OR YONKERS YESTERDAY THE E.U. CHIEF THAT WE IN THE WORDS OF THE TIMES WE MEDDLE IN AFFAIRS OF OTHERS ADMITS Y. YOU CHIEF BRUSSELS TO BLAME FOR ITS UNPOPULARITY
AND HE SAID IS THAT THE HE WAS WRONG TO HAVE MEDDLED IN PEOPLE'S DAILY LIVES AND HE'S PLEADING WITH VOTERS NOT TO WRECK THE IDEAL THE BLOCKS IDEAL HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE INS ACROSS CONTINENT WAS STEPPING AWAY AND LOSING RESPECT AND OBVIOUSLY FEARFUL THAT A BRITISH EX IT WOULD TRIGGER A CHAIN REACTION THE MALES ARE VERY SIMILAR WE DO MEDAL TOO MUCH IT'S THE TRUTH ON BLOATED BRUSSELS MANY OF THE LAWS BUSTLES MADE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT TO NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS
WITH A STORY THAT SAYS THE GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL THE G.M.C. HAS INTERVENED IN THE JUNIOR DOCTORS DISPUTE WITHOUT WARNING STARK WARNING ONES WHAT WE START THAT PATIENCE MAY BE HARMED DURING THE ALL OUT STRIKES NEXT WEEK IN HOSPITALS THAT STRUGGLE TO COPE IN THEIR ABSENCE THE M.C. TOLD TRAINEE MEDICS WORKING IN AREAS OF LIFE OR DEATH CARE SUCH AS A.&E. INTENSIVE CARE AND MATERNITY SERVICES THAT THEY SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT JOINING THE FIRST TOTAL WITHDRAWALS OF MEDICAL LABOUR
IN THE N.H.S. IS HISTORY I DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS BUT PROBABLY WORTH MENTIONING TO PHOTOGRAPHS THAT ARE ALMOST ON ONE OF OUR MANY OF THE FRONT PAGES BUT ALL OF THE
SUPPOSE THE HEIRS TO THE THRONE THE QUEEN PRINCE CHARLES PRINCE WILLIAM AND PRINCE GEORGE IT'S ALL FOR HER SAID SET OF NEW STAMPS BUT BECAUSE OF THE STRIKING IMAGE IT'S PICKED UP BY ALL THE PAPERS AND THE LITTLE OR HERE HE'S STANDING ON A BOX
WHICH IS RATHER SWEET ANYWAY QUITE STORY ABOUT PAUL BARRETT HE'S A RETIRED BUILDER AND HE IS OBSESSED AND WHEN I OBSESSED I MEAN OBSESSED WITH THE MUSIC OF MANTOVANI WHICH YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER BUT HE WAS AWFULLY POPULAR MANTOVANI AND HE'S SWOOPING STRINGS AND ALL THAT ANYWAY SO OBSESSED IS
THIS CHAP THAT MISSED ABOUT THAT IF HE HAS SPENT HALF A MILLION POUNDS YES HALF A MILLION I WAS RECREATING THE MANTOVANI ORCHESTRA AND PERFORMING IN SELF INNIT ON DRUMS AND TIMPANI AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING I'D CHOSEN TO INVEST IN REINVENTING THE MANTOVANI ORCHESTRA SAYS IT'S AN EXPENSIVE BUSINESS HE CAN SAY THAT AGAIN BUT TO ME IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY
IT'S TEN MINUTES PAST SIX NOW THE MAN WHO RUNS TATA STEEL'S PORT ALBERT BUSINESS IS PLANNING A MANAGEMENT BUY OUT OF THE COMPANY BRIAN MEACHAM IS A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT IN WALES BRIAN THIS IS A PLAN THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN PUT TOGETHER BY STUART WILKIE THE BON SUPPORT ALBERT CAN WHAT CAN WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT IT
THIS WAS THE PLAN THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY STUART WILKIE AND THERE AND THE DIRECTORS OF TARTAR IN EUROPE IT HAS TO BE SAID IT INCLUDED WI ME REMEMBER IN JANUARY THOSE THOUSAND JOB LOSSES IN CALL ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE U.K. INCLUDING SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY AT PORT TALBOT NO IT HAS TO BE SAID THAT WAS THE PLAN THAT WENT TO TATA STEEL IN MUMBAI IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A SURVIVAL PLAN EVEN BY THE MANAGEMENT TEAM OF TARTAR IN THE U.K.
AND IT WAS REJECTED BY THE TARTAR IMRAN MUMBAI WHO SAID IT WAS TOO RISKY HOWEVER THE TEAM ARE QUITE COMMITTED TO THIS THEY SEE THEY CAN TURN ROUND PORT TALBOT WHICH IS LOSING A MILLION POUNDS A DAY IT'S BEEN REPORTED WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS INTO PROFITABILITY SO THAT'S THE PLAN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMING FORWARD WITH INTEREST IF HE'S NOT WASN'T SEEN AS A RUNNER WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEFT OF THE WHOLE OF TAT ARE STILL BEHIND IT
WHY IS IT ANY MORE LIKELY TO BE CREDIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL WHEN IT'S RUN BY THE THE MANAGEMENT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THAT ANYONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER ULTIMATELY I THINK WHAT HAS CHANGED IS THE U.K. GOVERNMENT'S POSITION IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR THAT TATA STEEL IN MUMBAI
ULTIMATELY RUN OUT OF PATIENCE WITH THE POLITICS OF ALL OF THIS IT HAD BEEN RAISING CONCERNS FOR YEARS ABOUT THE COST OF ENERGY COSTS AND BUSINESS RATES IN THE U.K. IT DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS GETTING ANYWHERE AND THEN THERE WAS THOSE CHINESE IMPORTS THAT IT DIDN'T FEEL THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS PUTTING ENOUGH TARIFFS ON TO PROTECT THE INDUSTRY IN THE U.K.
I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN NO ULTIMATELY IS A U.K. GOVERNMENT MOVING SIGNIFICANTLY IT HAS VERY RECENTLY IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO THAT IT IS WILLING TO BE A CO INVESTOR AT THESE STATES THAT CERTAINLY WASN'T ON THE TABLE FROM THE U.K. GOVERNMENT AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS CLAN AND INDEED ULTIMATELY I THINK ANY PLAN TO SAVE PORT TALBOT AND THE REST OF TARTAR STILL INDUSTRY IS GOING TO INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INVESTMENT FROM THE U.K. GOVERNMENT
IT WOULD INVOLVE WHAT WOULD IT MEAN FOR CHANGES WITHIN THE COMPANY BUT I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IS PERHAPS NOT RUNNING THE BLAST FURNACE AS IT HAS BEEN BUT THIS WOULD ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE AS IT AS IT AS IT'S BEEN RUNNING FOR YEARS THAT'S RIGHT YES ESSENTIALLY THERE IS THE OTHER PLAN THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD ON THE OTHER COMPANY THAT'S PUBLICLY COME FORWARD AND SAID IT IS INTERESTED HIS LIBERTY STEEL WHICH IS BASED IN NEWPORT
IT WANTS TO MOVE WHAT HAPPENS AT PORT TALBOT AWAY FROM MAKING STEEL FROM SCRATCH IN THE BLAST FURNACES INTO RECYCLING STEEL AND THAT'S USING ARC FURNACES THEY CONCERN HAS BEEN FROM THE UNIONS AND OTHERS THAT THAT COULD LEAD TO EVEN MORE JOB LOSSES AT PORT TALBOT I BELIEVE THAT THIS PLAN FROM STUART WILKIE AND THE TARTAR TEAM WOULD SEE IT RUNNING AS IT HAS BEEN RUNNING BUT I THINK THE CONDITIONS WILL CHANGE PRIME EACH AND THANKS VERY MUCH
THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX FOR YEARS THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN GROWING LESS VIOLENT IF WE'RE TO TRUST THE CRIME FIGURES NOW THERE'S EVIDENCE FROM ANOTHER SOURCE THAT SUPPORTS THAT OR RATHER THAT IT HAS COME TO A STOP THAT DECLINE IN VIOLENCE HAS COME TO A HALT HE SHOWS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY THIS THESE ARE FIGURES FROM HOSPITAL A.&E. UNITS WHICH SHOW THAT REALLY
THIS DECLINE IN VIOLENCE HAS ENDED YET AS A STUDY BY CARDIFF UNIVERSITY OF A. AND E. UNIT ADMISSIONS FOR PEOPLE TREATED FOR INJURED FOR VIOLENCE RELATED INJURIES THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS STUDY FOR MANY YEARS AND WHAT THEY SAY ARE SUGGESTING IS THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT THE DECLINE IN VIOLENCE AT THEY'VE SEEN HAS NOT HAPPENED
LAST YEAR THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ATTENDED EMERGENCY UNITS THAT'S AN ESTIMATE SLIGHTLY DOWN ON THE YEAR BEFORE BUT IT'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION SO WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THAT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THIS A LONG TERM DECLINE THE LONG STEADY DECLINE IN VIOLENCE IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS COME TO AN END AND IS THAT IN PART IS THERE'S AS I SIT A STUDY FROM
UNIVERSITY OF CARDIFF SUGGESTING THAT THAT MAY BE BECAUSE THE C. C. T. V. FOURTEEN ISN'T AVAILABLE TO THE POLICE AND THE WAY THAT IT WAS THERE'S LESS OF IT AND THEY'RE NOT RESPONDING TO IT IN THE WAY THEY DID THAT CERTAINLY I THINK THE CONCLUSION THAT'S BEEN DRAWN BY PROFESSOR JONATHAN SHEPHERD WHO IS THERE WHO LEASED THIS RESEARCH HE BELIEVES THAT THE C.C.T.V. CAMERAS PLACED AROUND AREAS WHERE STREET
VIOLENCE IS MOST LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE PUBS AND CLUBS YOU KNOW CLOSING TIME THE KIND OF BRAWLS THAT RESULT IN PEOPLE ATTENDING A ANY UNITS HAS HELPED POLICE NIP PROBLEMS IN THE BUD GET TO TROUBLE SPOTS QUICKLY IF THOSE CAMERAS ARE MONITORED BY COUNCIL STAFF OR BY POLICE HE THINKS HE'S BEEN A DIS INVESTMENT BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND POLICE AND THAT WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN HUGE
BUDGET CUTS BY POLICE FORCES AND HE BELIEVES THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS SORT OF SLOWING DOWN OF THIS DECLINE IN VIOLENCE HE ALSO BELIEVES THAT ALCOHOL PRICING MAY HAVE AN EFFECT AS WELL THE PRICE OF BEER HAS NOT BEEN GOING UPPERS AS MUCH AS IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN DUTY PAID
DANNY MANY THANKS WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT PROFESSOR LATER IN THE PROGRAMME AT THE WITH IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST SIX WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR SOME BUSINESS NEWS AND MATTHEW PRICES HERE TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ADVERTISING BILLBOARD MATTHEW AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE SARAH IT'S ALL GOING TO BE INTERACTIVE MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT ALSO WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THE PROTECTIONIST RHETORIC COMING OUT OF THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES BUT FIRST LET'S GET SOME ANALYSIS ON WHAT WE WERE JUST HEARING FROM PRIME MEAT FROM DOWN IN WALES HAVE A POSSIBLE MANAGEMENT BUY OUT
FOR THE TART A STEELWORKS BRENDA KELLY IS HERE HEAD ANALYST AT LONDON CAPITAL GROUP GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HE IF A MANAGEMENT BUY OUT IS TO WORK THEY'LL NEED INVESTOR MONEY WILL THEY GET IT FROM INVESTORS I THINK IT'LL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT A FOURTH TO INVESTORS IN TERMS OF HAD BEEN A VIABLE COMMERCIAL
BUSINESS REALLY AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME THERE ARE A LOT OF TROUBLE SURROUNDING TATA STEEL AND ONE OF THOSE IS VERY MUCH THE COMPETITION COMING FROM THE CHINESE STEEL INDUSTRY BUT I DO SENSE THAT IF THERE WAS SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT TO IT AND OF COURSE THEY ARE QUITE RESTRICTED IN WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO IT COULD OBVIOUSLY ENCOURAGE INVESTORS ARE TO GET ON BOARD BUT IT WILL STILL NEED TO BE COMMERCIAL AS FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED UNDERWORLD STILL NEED TO BE SOME SORT OF RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT
IN ORDER TO REALLY KIND OF ATTRACT THOSE INVESTORS OH KAY IT REALLY QUICK ONE ON GOLDMAN SACHS SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPANY'S QUARTERLY PROFIT FELL BY MORE THAN HALF IS IT THE END OF THE INVESTMENT BANKING ERA I DON'T THINK IT'S THE END I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY THE DEVOLUTION OFFICE AND CERTAINLY I THINK COST CUTTING SEEMS TO BE THE REAL TEAM BEHIND INVESTMENT BANKS AT THE MOMENT IN TERMS OF KEEPING SHAREHOLDERS ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW BUT ULTIMATELY IT IS GOING TO BE A CHANGING
AND COMPLEX ENOUGH TO BANKING ESTATE GLOBALLY NOT JUST IN THE U.S. AND ULTIMATELY WE ARE GOING TO SEE A CHANGE THERE BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE END O. K. LET'S STAY IN THE U.S. WE HAVE THOSE NEW YORK PRIMARY RESULTS COMING IN RIGHT NOW DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON SEEMING TO BE THE BIG WINNERS IT'S BEING PREDICTED FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL DIVIDE THERE'S BEEN A NOTABLE PROTECTIONIST THEME DEVELOPING THROUGHOUT THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN IT'S FEEDING OFF AND FEEDING POPULAR SENTIMENT A NEW YORK BUSINESS REPORTER MICHEL FLEW IT SETS THE SCENE FROM THE BIG APPLE
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO SEE NEW YORK IS BY WATER RIGHT NOW I'M ON THE STATEN ISLAND FERRY LOOKING AT WHERE THAT USED TO HUDSON RIVER MEET THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST NATURAL HARBOURS IN THE WORLD AND FOR CENTURIES IT'S BEEN A MAGNET FOR TRADE
THANK YOU THEY'RE WRITING THE STATEN I WOULDN'T
YET FOR ALL THE WEALTH CREATED THROUGH TRADE ANXIETY OVER GLOBALISATION IS PLAYING A STARRING ROLE IN THIS YEAR'S U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ON THE STUMP REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP KEEPS PUSHING THE SAME MESSAGE THAT FREE TRADE ESPECIALLY WITH CHINA HAS HURT ORDINARY AMERICANS
I HAVE MANY FRIENDS GREAT MANUFACTURERS THEY WANT TO GO INTO JANET THEY CAN CHANNEL MORE LAND AND WE TALK ABOUT REDROW IT'S NATURAL DRAINAGE STRIPPER DRAY SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS HAS ALSO SEIZED ON TRADE TO ILLUSTRATE THE NATION'S ECONOMIC WOES
SO CREATING WORK OLD BOY
MORE TRADE WITH CHINA OR SALISBURY BOY TRUE NO YOU'RE AMERICAN
INCLUDING ALL RIGHT DREAMT TWENTY THOUSAND CALLS AND SPAIN
THESE TENSIONED OVER TRADE HAVE FORCED THEIR PRINCIPAL RIVALS TO TOUGHEN THEIR POSITIONS SOMETIMES LANDING THEM IN HOT WATER LISTEN TO DEMOCRATIC FRONT RUNNER HILLARY CLINTON DEFEND HER CHANGE OF HEART ON A NEW TRADE DEAL THE TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP TEE PEE PEE
LOOKING AT IT IT DIDN'T MEET MY STANDARDS MY STANDARDS FOR WAR NEW JOBS FOR AMERICANS FOR RAISING WAGES FOR AMERICANS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN LOOK INTO THE EYES OF ANY MIDDLE CLASS AMERICAN AND SAY THIS WILL HELP RAISE YOUR WAGES AND I CONCLUDED I COULD
BUT WITH THE AMERICAN ECONOMY EXPANDING HOW MUCH OF A PRIORITY IS PROTECTING U.S. BUSINESSES FOR THOUGH
THEY HAD THE TRADE SYSTEM SO IT BENEFITS EVERYBODY OUTSIDE OF THIS COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE IN THIS COUNTRY THEY THEY'VE NOW BEEN FAIR WITH THINGS THIS
WE'RE AGAINST THE BUT PEAK OTHER THESE PEOPLE AS THEY MOVE JOBS FROM HERE
TO LOOK AT NEW YORK HARBOUR IS TO BE REMINDED OF HOW THE CITY
AND COUNTRY'S WEALTH GREW OUT OF GLOBAL COMMERCE
IT'S JUST THAT LOWERING THE BARRIERS TO TRADE OFTEN INSPIRES DOWD AND DESTROY
AMONGST VOTERS AND POLITICIANS
MYSELF THERE YOU GO TRUMP SAYS FREE TRADE IS STUPID TRADE BILL BLAINE HEAD OF CAPITAL MARKETS ALTERNATIVE ASSETS MEANT PARTNERS IS IN THE STUDIO MORNING GOOD MORNING FREE TRADE IS STUPID TRADE ARE PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT THE RHETORIC COMING OUT OF THE STATES AT THE MOMENT WELL THE SAD THING IS THAT THE KENNEL RHETORIC WERE SEEING AS GREAT SOUND BITE POLITICS THAT SOUNDS GREAT FOR AMERICAN WORKERS IN INEFFICIENT JOBS BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS SO INTERCONNECTED THAT IF
TRUMP WAS TO ELECT THE KIND OF BARRIERS HE'S SPEAKING ABOUT WHO DO FAR MORE DAMAGE TO DOMESTIC U.S. INDUSTRY THAT WOULD DO TO ANY OF US COMPRESSED YOU WORRY SO MUCH WORK BUT HE IS FEEDING OFF POPULAR SENTIMENT THAT HILLARY HERSELF IS ALSO
THE SHIFTING TOWARDS MORE PROTECTIONIST TALK SHEET SHE YESTERDAY SPOKE ABOUT HER CONCERNS ABOUT THE TRADE DEAL THE U.S. HAS WITH ASIA WHICH HASN'T YET GONE THROUGH CONGRESS CORRECT THEY'RE ALL PLAYING A GAME OF COMPETITIVE TOK COMPETITIVE SOUND BITES AND WHO CARES MOST ABOUT THE AMERICAN WORKER THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT GOING T. T. P. T. P. P. THE TRANS PACIFIC TRADE AGREEMENT TO SIGN
IT WILL CREATE GROWTH ON BOTH SIDES SO YOU HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL GET SIGNED IT WILL GET THROUGH IT WELL I DO ACTUALLY I DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS COS IT'S TAKEN YEARS TO GET TO THE STAGE SO THERE IS ENJOYS THAT SO THERE IS A CHANCE OF THIS POPULAR SENTIMENT AND RHETORIC COULD ACTUALLY TRANSLATE INTO SOMETHING MORE DAMAGING OUT OF AMERICA WE ALREADY HAVE A GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT STYMIED AND SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS IT'S JUST HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THE CO OPERATION REQUIRED
TO CREATE GROWTH AND NOW WE'VE GOT ANOTHER BARRIER OCCURRING IN THE U.S. WHERE THE KEN RHETORIC WE'RE SEEING IN THIS ELECTION SEEMS TO BE CLOSING THE DOOR NOW IF WE END UP WITH THE OTHER TRUMP OR CLINTON AND POWER AT THE END
BOTH OF THEM ARE STILL GOING TO FACE THE REALITY OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WILL OCCUR OR TRYING TO PUSH IT THROUGH CONGRESS O.K. INTERESTING YOU SPENT TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN INVESTMENT BANKING YOU ASS GUILTINESS LIKE I COULD ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION VERY BRIEF ANSWER I ASKED BRENDA IS IT THE END OF THE INVESTMENT BANKING ERA I'M ABS ARE CONVINCED HIS WERE SEEN ENORMOUS EVOLUTION IN THE WAY THAT FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDED WE'RE IN A PERIOD OF HIATUS WHEN IT FINISHES I VERY MUCH DOUBT WILL SEE THE CURRENT INVESTMENT BANKS STILL IN THE SAME POSITION ON THE RUN TODAY
BILL BLAME THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NOW THERE IS A REMINDER THIS MORNING OF HOW TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING THE ECONOMY INTEL THE MICRO CHIP MAKER IS SLASHING ITS WORKFORCE BY UP TO TWELVE THOUSAND SOME ELEVEN PER CENT AS IT STRUGGLES TO KEEP UP WITH MOVES AWAY FROM P.C.S TECH IS REVOLUTIONISING THE ADVERTISING WORLD AS WELL AS I FOUND OUT HE'D ADD WEEK THE BIGGEST COMING TOGETHER ABOUT A MEDIA PROFESSIONALS WHICH IS BEING HELD IN THE HEART OF THE NATION'S CAPITAL
IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE PAST OR THE FUTURE ARE COLLIDING HERE JUST OFF PICCADILLY CIRCUS I'VE JUST WALKED PAST THOSE WRITE TELEVISION ADVERTISING HOARDINGS
PROMOTE EVERYTHING FROM COCA COLA TO MCDONALD'S AND SAMSAM THEY CATCH THE EYE POSSIBLY HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY
BUT THAT IS THE WAY THAT ADVERTISING USE TO WORK
HERE INSIDE THE PICTURE HOW CENTRAL
WHERE WHAT'S BILLED AS THE PREMIER CONFERENCE FOR MARKETING AND ADVERTISING PROFESSIONALS IS TAKING PLACE THE FUTURE IS THE BUZZ AND IT'S FAR MORE MOBILE AND INTRUSIVE THAN THOSE BILLBOARDS OF YESTERYEAR
I GAVE YOU A TIME I'M NOT AN INVESTOR AND THE FOUNDER OF FREE REFORMERS WHICH IS A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IT IS
AND THAT THAT NEW WORLD IS A WORLD CREATED WHERE EVERYONE CAN CONNECT TO IT
EVERYONE CARRIES THEMSELVES AROUND IN A CONNECTED THE FEISTY NOW AND I THINK A LOT OF THE ADVERTISING
MISSING OUT ON THE POTENTIAL FOR THESE REVENUE SO THE BIG BILLBOARDS THAT WE SEE ON OUR STREET CORNERS ARE THEIR DAYS NUMBERED THEIR DAYS IN THEIR CURRENT FORM
THAT BILLBOARD IS GOING TO CHANGE ITS NATURE I WALK PAST IT WITH MY SMART PHONE MY SMARTPHONE COMMUNICATES WITH THE BILLBOARD AND TELLS IT THAT I PARTICULARLY LIKE A BRAND OF FAST FOOD AND IT'S NOT PUMPING OUT THAT FAST FOOD YEAH BUT IT MIGHT BE EVEN CRAZIER THAN THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT BILLBOARD
SELECT YOU RESERVE FINALLY CUSTOMERS ALL THE OTHER BILLBOARDS MY LIGHT HARPER NO BOOBA MIGHT TURN UP OR SOMEONE WOULD HAVE BEEN BENT AT THE PLATFORM WHICH IS
LINSEY I HEAD AS A WHICH GETS TRIGGERED
AND CREATES AN EMOTIONAL STATEMENT OF WELLBEING AS A RESULT OF
MINDFULNESS PROGRAMME YOU'VE UPGRADED TO YOURSELF THAT SORT OF STUFF IS BECOMING REALITY THERE ARE PEOPLE PLAY
I'M JUST GOING TO WANDER UP TO MATCH SCHICK
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ADVERTISING

THERE WAS NO U.TWO NO NET LEGS NO I KNOW BUT HE WAS TOLD ABOUT BRANDED COUNTER IN THE SAME WAY THEY ARE TODAY AND WITH THAT IN MIND JUST ANYBODY HERE TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK EVERYONE'S TRYING TO
ALL OF THIS INNOVATION IS NOT JUST DISRUPTIVE FOR THE OLD STYLE APPETISING IF YOU LIKE IT'S ALSO
DISRUPTIVE FOR THOSE WHO WERE THERE WITH THE INTERNET AT THE BEGINNING YOU'RE HERE FOR INSTANCE IS IN DIFFICULTIES ITS SAILS FROM BOTH ITS SEARCH ENGINE AND ONLINE ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGY HAVE DROPPED ITS U.K. MANAGING DIRECTOR IS NIGEL CLARKE

BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE SAME ACCESS PRESUMABLY THROUGH ALL THAT SORT OF DATE AS THE LIKES OF GOOGLE
I DON'T THINK WE ARE GETTING IT WRONG IT'S NOT DOING AS GREAT AS A BUSINESS AS THE LIKES OF GOOGLE FACEBOOK IN TERMS OF TAKING ADVERTISING THINGS
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE ADVERTISING HAS CHANGED YAHOO WAS INVOLVED IN IN MANY DIFFERENT AREAS OF ADVERTISING AND IT GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK GET ALL THE HEADLINES BUT THE ACCESS THAT WE HAVE TOO MANY DIFFERENT DATA POINTS SUCH AS FLICKER SUCH AS THE CONTINENT THE READING WHAT THEY'RE SHARING HAS MEANT ACTUALLY WE ARE WE'RE IN A REALLY STRONG SPACE

I THINK THE POTENTIAL OFFICE THAT WE'LL SEE WHAT WE HELP DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE CORE BUSINESS OFF YAHOO ULTIMATELY AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN AND HOW PEOPLE ARE VALUING AT ANYTHING BETWEEN ONE BILLION AND TEN BILLION DEPENDING ON THE VALUATION METRICS ALL RIGHT BRENDA KELLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED BACK IN AN HOUR WITH THE SLOWDOWN OF U.K. HOUSE BUILDING

NEW RESEARCH SUGGEST PARTICIPATING AND AFTER SCHOOL CLUBS IMPROVES THE TEST RESULTS OF DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN STUDY BASED ON INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN IN ENGLAND HOW THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ONE OR TWO DAYS A WEEK MADE MORE PROGRESS THAN THEIR PEERS FROM SIMILAR BACKGROUNDS WHO ONLY DID THE NORMAL SCHOOL DAY
IT IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN EIGHTY THOUSAND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT'S WHAT THE MOST RECENT FIGURES SUGGEST A REPORTER'S HUMOUR CONTEST HAS BEEN TALKING TO NINE YEAR OLD PAUL HE HAS HIGH FUNCTIONING AUTISM AND DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS VERY DEPRESSED

SO PAUL'S MOTHER CLAIRE GOT IN TOUCH WITH US WITH HER SON'S STORY AND INVITED ME TO THEIR HOME TO SPEAK TO PAUL AND HE IS INCREDIBLY ARTICULATE AS YOU JUST SAID THEY'RE A FANTASTIC VOCABULARY BUT WHAT IS VERY
PROFOUND IS HE IS A VERY SAD CHILD AND HE TALKS ABOUT WANTING TO END HIS LIFE HE TALKS ABOUT BEING BULLIED AT SCHOOL HE TALKS ABOUT FEELING VERY ISOLATED IN THIS WORLD EVEN THOUGH
HE LIVES IN A FAMILY THAT OBVIOUSLY LOVES HIM VERY MUCH AND I THINK WHAT IS WHAT IS KEY HERE JOHN IS THAT HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WE KNOW FROM FIGURES FROM NICE THE LATEST FIGURES IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AROUND AS YOU SAY EIGHTY THOUSAND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION IN THIS COUNTRY AT THE PROBLEM I SUPPOSE IS THAT WITH CHILDREN AT THAT AGE IT'S TEMPTING TO THINK OF THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A PHASE OR THEY'VE GOT A BIT A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM AT SCHOOL OR TO GET SORTED OUT
BUT THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM IN THAT THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED YES AND CLAIRE THE MOTHER IS CAMPAIGNING FOR MORE HELP FOR CHILDREN SHE SAYS THAT THERE IS THIS PROBLEM THAT SOME PEOPLE FEEL THAT WERE NINE YEAR OLD SURELY HE CAN'T HAVE DEPRESSION A AS YOU SAY IT MUST BE A PHASE AND SHE SAID IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING COS SHE FEELS AS IF SHE'S COMING UP AGAINST LOTS OF BARRIERS HE'S BEEN LIKE THIS FOR SOME TIME HAS IT YES SHE SAID HE'S BEEN LIKE THIS FOR YEARS AND THE OLDER HE GETS
THE MORE SIX SINK TO HIS WHAT HOW HE FEELS HE MAKES IT VERY CLEAR AS I SAID CONTINUOUSLY SAYS HE WANTS TO END HIS LIFE SO SHE'S INCREDIBLY WORRIED AND JUST JOHN JUST JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME MORE FIGURES WE KNOW FROM A PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION SUBMITTED LAST YEAR THAT MORE THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO A. AND E. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS THAT'S DOUBLE THE NUMBER FROM FOUR YEARS EARLIER
HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S A PROBLEM WELL WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTING ONE POINT FIVE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION OVER THIS PARLIAMENT TO TRANSFORM MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IT SAYS IT'S ALSO GIVEN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS TO PROJECTS WHICH CAN HELP LAND SO FROM THOSE NUMBERS THEY OBVIOUSLY DO THINK IT IS IS AN ISSUE AND HAS MADE THOSE INVESTMENTS SEEN AT THANK YOU WE'LL HEAR MORE OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY INTERVIEW AT TEN PAST EIGHT
IT'S NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AMERICA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH SAUDI ARABIA HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY STRAINED LATELY WHICH IS WHY THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF FOCUS ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRIP TO THE COUNTRY WILL BE ARRIVING THERE LATER THIS MORNING ON NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SABLE IS IN RIYADH AND JOHN WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS FROM THIS TRIP
I THINK WE'LL GET THE HANDSHAKES I THINK WE'LL GET A BIT OF BACK SLAPPING AND I THINK THERE'LL BE A HUGE AMOUNT OF INNES I WAS ON A BRIEFING CALL ON THE RECORD WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TALKING ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP
BEING COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS NOT QUITE RIGHT IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP AT THE HEART OF IT TWO THINGS ONE IS THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL
WHERE THE SAUDIS FEEL THAT THE AMERICANS IT COMPLETELY IGNORED THEIR CONCERNS OVER WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF IT WOULD BE AND THE SECOND THING THE FIGHT AGAINST SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THE AMERICANS BELIEVED THAT THE SAUDI ARABIA COULD BE DOING FAR FORM UP FAR FAR MORE MILITARILY CHALLENGING THE PROPAGANDA CUTTING OFF THEIR MEANS OF FINANCIAL SUPPLY
WHEREAS THE SAUDIS THINK WELL AMERICA HAS BEEN WEAK AND VACILLATING AND INDECISIVE IN ITS RESPONSE SO IT DOESN'T REALLY SET THE STAGE FOR THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE MEETING AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE HERE IN SAUDI ARABIA WHO YOU YOU HERE SAYING ACTUALLY WE'VE ALREADY GONE BEYOND THINKING ABOUT DEALING WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION
THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SAUDIS AND BARACK OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION THAT THE SAUDIS ARE ALREADY LOOKING TO WHO MIGHT SUCCEED HIM NOW YOU LEAVE WHEN HE LEAVE SAUDI ARABIA'S COMING ON TO EUROPE AND THE AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE BRITISH DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE Y. YOU STEPPING UP GIVEN WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN THE TIMES TODAY BY EIGHT FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY
YES I THINK THIS IS QUITE A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT ISN'T IT BECAUSE I JUST I WAS JUST KIND OF THINKING BACK TO FOR EXAMPLE THE GREEK DEBT CRISIS DID YOU GET EIGHT U.S. TREASURY SECRETARIES COMING TOGETHER BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT
GREECE HAS GOT TO SORT THIS OUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK THE QUEST QUESTION WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF CONCERN IN THE UNITED STATES ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U.
I THINK THIS LETTER IS A VERY CLEAR ANSWER THAT THE CONCERN IS VERY DEEP AND WHILE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH BARACK OBAMA WILL OR WON'T TIPTOE AROUND THE SUBJECT WHEN HE COMES TO LONDON AT THE END OF THE WEEK I SUGGEST I SUSPECT HE WON'T TIPTOE AROUND IT THAT MUCH THESE PEOPLE FEEL NO CONSTRAINTS I KNOW YOU'VE SPOKEN TO LARRY SUMMERS WHO WAS THE TREASURY SECRETARY IN THE CLINTON ERA
BUT THEY HAVE WRITTEN THIS VERY LONG LETTER WHICH THEY SAY A STRONG AND RESILIENT EUROPE WITH BRITAIN AT THE CALL IN OUR VIEW WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT FORCE IN ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES THAT THE WORLD FACES TOGETHER AT THE ARGUMENT IS THAT EUROPE WILL BE WEAKER
BRITAIN WILL BE WEAKER AMERICA WILL BE WEAKER IT WILL THERE'S A GREAT IN DIPPING INTER DEPENDENCE ON THE WORLD AND IS VITAL FOR BRITAIN TO REMAIN WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION IF IT IS TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF SORT OF THE GLOBAL INTERDEPENDENCE THAT WE BELIEVE CUT INSIDE THOUGH SAYING LOOK THIS IS NUMBER TEN ORCHESTRATING ALL LISTEN AMERICA SHOULD BUTT OUT
WELL I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ORIGIN OF THE LETTER IS THESE EIGHT PRETTY SENIOR POLICY MAKERS WHO I'M SURE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ON WHAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO PUT THEIR NAMES TO IN A NEWSPAPER LETTER AND WHAT THE IMPACT OF IT WOULD BE
THEY REPRESENT A GOOD DEAL OF HUGE ABOUT A PUBLIC SERVICE THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN AND WHO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR STEERING THE U.S. ECONOMY I THINK YES YOU CAN SAY SHOULD THEY OR SHOULD THEY NOT BE INTERFERING BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DOUBT THE SINCERITY THAT THEY'RE EXPRESSING OR THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE DONE THIS WILLINGLY WELL THAT INTERVIEW WITH LARRY SUMMERS YOU CAN HEAR AT TEN TO EIGHT THIS MORNING JOHN SOPER THANKS VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND SEVERAL OF THEM LEAD WITH THE ADMISSION BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION JOB PLOT YOU'LL YOKO THAT THE E.U. IS INTERFERING IN TOO MANY AREAS OF PEOPLE'S PRIVATE LIVES
THE EXPRESS THINKS IT'S WAS AN ASTONISHING CONFESSION OF FAILURE BANNISTER YOKE AT THE MAIL SAYS HE WAS PROBABLY SEEKING TO MOLLIFY SCEPTICAL OPINION IN BRITAIN BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT IF WE WALK OTHERS MAY FOLLOW THE TIMES AGREED TO THAT IT SAYS THERE ARE GROWING FEARS IN BRUSSELS THAT A BRITISH EX IT WOULD TRIGGER A CHAIN REACTION
ITS MAIN STORY THE TELEGRAPH LAUNCHES A CAMPAIGN HIGHLIGHTING WHAT IT CALLS THE POROUS NATURE OF BRITAIN'S BORDERS IT'S BORDER SECURITY CAMPAIGN URGES THE GOVERNMENT TO TIGHTEN CONTROLS TO KEEP JIHADI ATTACKERS AND MUSLIM EXTREMISTS OUT IT SAYS AMERICA ROUTINELY SCREENS SUSPICIOUS TRAVELLERS AND REFUSES ENTRY TO ANYONE DEEMED TO POTENTIAL TERROR RISK SHOULD WE NOT BE DOING THE SAME ITS LEADER COLUMN ASKS
GORDON MIRRORS LEAD INTELLIGENCE CHIEFS HAVE WARNED THAT ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS ARE PLANNING TO ATTACK TOURISTS ON MEDITERRANEAN BEACHES IN EUROPE THE REPORT WHICH IS OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL SO IT'S EVIDENCE FROM WHAT HE CALLS CREDIBLE SOURCES IN AFRICA WHICH SUGGEST THE PLANS ARE ADVANCED STAGE TARGETS ARE SAID TO INCLUDE RESORT IN SOUTHERN FRANCE THE COSTA DEL SOL IN SPAIN AND THE EAST AND WEST COAST OF ITALY THE GUARDIAN LEADS ON THE GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL'S APPEAL TO JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND TRYING TO GO ON STRIKE NEXT WEEK TO CONSIDER WHETHER THEIR HOSPITALS CAN COPE
IT SAYS SEVERAL LEADING DOCTORS HAVE URGED THEM TO THINK HARD ABOUT THE RISK TO PATIENTS THE TELEGRAPH SUPPORTS THE G.M.C. IS POSITION SAYING THE WARNING THAT SOME HOSPITALS CAN'T COPE WITH AN ALL OUT STRIKE SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH THE UTMOST SERIOUSNESS
THE SUN REPORTS THAT PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN HAVE BEEN APPALLED BY A COUNCIL LETTER THAT ASKS THEM TO LEAVE THEIR GENDER SECTION ON A FORM BLANK IF THEIR CHILDREN DO NOT IDENTIFY AS BEING MALE OR FEMALE BUT HAVE ANOTHER GENDER IDENTITY ALTOGETHER IT SAYS THE LETTER WAS SENT TO PARENTS BY BRIGHTON AND HOVE CITY COUNCIL EARLIER THIS WEEK CONFIRMING PRIMARY SCHOOL PLACES FOR THEIR CHILDREN THE COUNCIL TELLS A PAPER THAT INCREASING NUMBERS OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE NATIONALLY ARE IDENTIFYING AS TRANSGENDER
AND FINALLY THE PAPERS MARK THE EVE OF THE QUEEN'S NINETIETH BIRTHDAY BY PRINTING AN OFFICIAL PORTRAIT OF HER ALONGSIDE HER THREE HEIRS THE PICTURE OF THE QUEEN THE PRINCE OF WALES THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE AND PRINCE GEORGE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE WAS TAKEN BUCKINGHAM PALACE FOR A NEW SET OF COMMEMORATIVE STAMPS PRINCE GEORGE'S WHAT THE EXPRESS CALLS A CHEEKY GRIN AND HE'S PERCHED ON A PILE OF FOAM BLOCKS BUT AS THE MALE PUTS IT HE'S HOLDING DADDY'S HAND JUST IN CASE
THE TIMES DESCRIBES IT AS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING ROYAL GREAT PORTRAITS OF RECENT YEARS THE PHOTOGRAPHER RANALD MCKECHNIE IS QUOTED AS SAYING PRINCE GEORGE'S JOY CARRIES THE WHOLE THING SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SERVE ON THE CHANCELLOR HAS DEFENDED THE CLAIM THAT HE MADE ON MONDAY THAT IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IT WOULD COST HOUSEHOLDS AN AVERAGE OF FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR AT QUESTION TIME YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AS OPPONENTS REPEATED THE CHALLENGE THAT FIGURE IS A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT HE WAS SUSAN
SOME COMMENTATORS HAVE ACCUSED LABOUR OF BEING A BIT LIKE A DAY'S A CALL WHEN IT COMES TO OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT RECENTLY SO HERE'S A CONSERVATIVE M.P. SHOWING HOW IT'S REALLY DONE DISGRACEFULLY DODGY DOCUMENT PUBLISHED BY
FRANKLY AS WORTHY OF THE CHILDREN'S PROGRAMME JACK AND LAURA THAT'S PHILIP HOLLER BORN A PROMINENT LEAVE CAMPAIGNER AND GIVING HIS PUNGENT VERDICT ON THE TREASURY DOCUMENT IN FAVOUR OF THE U.K. STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION DAVID GOCH THE TREASURY MINISTER WHO IS OFTEN TO BE FOUND BATTING AT THE DESPATCH BOX WHEN THE WICKET STICKY STOOD UP STOUTLY FOR THE DOCUMENT IN TERMS OF THE TREASURY ANALYSIS A LARGE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC COMMENTATORS
ARGUE THAT IT IS BROADLY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SOME CONSERVATIVES NODDED IN AGREEMENT BUT DIDN'T SPEAK OTHER M.P.S THERE WERE PREPARED TO SPEAK UP FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ANALYSIS LABOUR ONCE THIS WAS HELEN GOODMAN THE IMPACT OF E.U. MEMBERSHIP ON JOBS IS OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT COULD THE MINISTER PAST MY CONGRATULATIONS TO THE OFFICIALS WHO HAVE DONE SUCH A VERY USEFUL
THERE WERE SOME NOT ENTIRELY SINCERE SOUNDING CHEERS FROM THE BACK OF THE TORY BENCHES QUESTIONS MOVED ON TO HOUSING WHICH BROUGHT THE CONSERVATIVE CHRISTOPHER A CHIP TO HIS FEET WITH A CONCERN ABOUT ESTIMATES OF THE LEVEL OF IMMIGRATION TO THE U.K. OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
NET MIGRATION OF AN ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION PEOPLE GOING TO HELP FIRST TIME BUYERS FIND A HOME
WHILE THE CHANCELLOR HIMSELF WAS ANSWERING THIS TIME AND HE SAID HE'D COME UP WITH HELP FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS BUT HE ARGUED FOR ANYONE WHO THOUGHT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD STOP IMMIGRATION IT WOULDN'T AT LEAST NOT OF THE U.K. STILL WANTED TO TRADE FREELY MAKE THIS OBSERVATION ON MIGRATION YOU CANNOT
TO THE SINGLE MARKET WITHOUT ACCEPTING FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY CLEAR PRINCIPLE THAT HAS BEEN MADE VERY STARKLY CLEAR TO THIS COUNTRY BY GERMANY AND FRANCE AND IS INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED AND SO IF YOU WANT ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE
FOR MOST OF THE NEXT HOUR OF QUESTIONS TO TREASURY MINISTERS M.P.S ASKED ABOUT OTHER THINGS BUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE SESSION THE SPEAKER CALLED A STRING OF PRELL LEAVE CONSERVATIVES SIR GERALD HOWARTH TOOK UMBRAGE AT THE IDEA THAT LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS WANTED TO RETREAT FROM THE WORLD
THE TRUTH IS FAR FROM THAT WE WANT TO THE UNITED KINGDOM TO BREAK FREE FROM THE SCLEROTIC SHACKLES OF THE E.U. AND IT SUPERSTATE AND EMBRACE THE EXCITING WORLD OUT THERE GEORGE OSBORNE SAID HE RESPECTED SIR GERALD'S VIEWS BUT I WOULD JUST OBSERVE THERE NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THIS COUNTRY'S ALLIES OR FRIENDS ABROAD ARE RECOMMENDING THAT WE LEAVE THE E.U.
ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE SIR EDWARD LEE DEPLOYED AN ARGUMENT MUCH USED BY OPPOSITION PARTIES THAT THE TREASURY ECONOMIC PREDICTIONS JUST AREN'T VERY GOOD THE TREASURY CAN'T EVEN GET ITS FORECAST ON
THE DEFICIT CORRECT FOR NEXT YEAR THAT'S RIGHT SHOUT AT A SCOTTISH NATIONALIST WHO RECOGNISED HIS OWN LINE SIR EDWARD WENT ON SAYING THAT USING TEN DENTURES FIGURES ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THE U.K. LEFT THE E. YOU SIMPLY BUT HOLES
THE REPUTATION OF THE TREASURY FOR ECONOMIC COMPETENCE AND FORECAST
IT'S A RELYING ON FEAR WISELY YOU GIVE US HIS VISION
COMPARED TO A VISION OF A FREE PEOPLE IN A FREE PARLIAMENT CONTROLLING OUR OWN BORDERS AND LEAVING THE WORLD TOWARDS FREE TRADE
BACKERS OF STAYING IN THE Y. YOU HAVE PRODUCED THEIR OWN SPOOF DOSSIER OF THE LEAF SIDES PLANS WHICH CONTAINS JUST EMPTY PAGES GEORGE OSBORNE TO THOUGHT LEAVE NEEDED TO GET DOWN TO FACTS AND FIGURES ARE POSITIVE VISION IS THERE BY BEING PART OF A REFORMED YOU WEAK AND RAISE LIVING STANDARDS CRAIGMORE MORE
MAKE SURE THAT THEY COULD SEE THIS HAVE ACCESS TO LOWER PRICES WE'VE SET OUT IN THE TREASURY ANALYSIS A RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES FOR THE ALTERNATIVES ARE MY HAPPY BRITAIN LEAVES THE EUROPEAN UNION ALL OF THEM WERE MADE BRITAIN PERMANENTLY POORER BUT I WOULD SAY TO HIM IF HE WANTS TO PRODUCE ALL THE LEAF CAMPAIGN WANTS TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN PLAN THEIR OWN ANALYSIS
NO EVEN THOUGH ONLY ONE CONSERVATIVE BACKBENCHERS SPOKE UP FOR THE E. YOU ANT HE WAS CUT OFF IN MID FLOW OTHERS DID BACK THE GOVERNMENT ON OTHER SUBJECTS INDEED ONE SIR OLIVER HEALED WAS SO LOYAL HE SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT MINISTERS COULD ACTUALLY MAKE SUNSHINE ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE SOLAR ENERGY AVAILABLE IN BRITAIN HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT SO THERE WE ARE IF YOU'RE ENJOYING A LOVELY SPRING DAY WITH SOLAR ENERGY SHINING DOWN ON YOU FACT THE GOVERNMENT
ISN'T THERE YOU CAN HEAR MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST AT THE HOPPER STATE ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE IT'S ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S PROMISED TO TURN EVERY ENGLISH SCHOOL INTO AN ACADEMY HAS BEEN HUGELY CONTROVERSIAL ALTHOUGH MOST SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND NOW HAVE THAT STATUS INDEPENDENT OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES LESS THAN A SIXTH OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS HAVE CONVERTED AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT
HARDER FOR THEM WITH FEWER PUPILS AND SIMILAR BUDGETS TO OPERATE ON THEIR OWN THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS MOST OF THEM TO JOIN CHAINS OF ACADEMIES BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THEY CAN OPERATE WITH STANDARDS IN SOME EVEN DECLINING SUCH A BAD REPORTS
PUPILS AT GEORGE BET PRIMARY IN SMETHWICK MOST COME FROM POORER FAMILIES THEY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH AT HOME THEIR SCHOOL USED TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LOCAL LEAGUE TABLE NOW THANKS TO IMPROVED RESULTS IT'S CLOSE TO THE TOP
IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THIS SCHOOL JOINED THE ELLIOT FOUNDATION A MULTI ACADEMY TRUST OR MATT WITH SCHOOLS IN LONDON EAST ANGLIA AND HERE IN THE WEST MIDLANDS O. KAY
MOST PRIMATES ARE TOO SMALL TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT THEY RELY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO DEAL WITH SO CALLED BACK OFFICE MATTERS LIKE FINANCE AND LEGAL AFFAIRS AND TO PROVIDE HELP LIKE SENDING IN TEACHERS FROM THEIR OTHER SCHOOLS THAT'S WHAT MULTI ACADEMY TRUSTS DO TO ALAN SHEPARD IS EXECUTIVE PRINCIPLE OF GEORGE BETS THAT SCHOOL TO SCHOOL SUPPORT IS THERE BUT YOU ALSO GET THE BACK OFFICE AND THE BUILDING SUPPORT AS WELL
ALL THE DIRECTORS AT THE END OF A PHONE REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THEM WE GET TOGETHER ONCE A YEAR AS A WHOLE GROUP BUT YOU ALSO GET MEETINGS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WITH THE DIFFERENT DIRECTORS ABOUT
WHAT CAN THEY DO TO SUPPORT YOU IT'S A BACK OFFICE SUPPORT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES USE TO GIVE BUT IT'S A BIT MORE THEN YES IT IS A BIT MORE IT IS THAT
THAT A SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT AS WELL WHICH
HE'S NO LONGER BEAR REALLY IN IN LOCAL AUTHORITIES IT WAS TO BE DIMINISHED THAT IS THE CORE OF THE ARGUMENT MANY SAY THERE IS NO NEED FOR EVERY SCHOOL TO BECOME AN ACADEMY THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE PERFECTLY PLACED TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS BUT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS MATT DO IT BETTER BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS DO THINGS FIRST
SHE WON'T JUST GIVE UP WE SHOULD KEEP TRADE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T A LESSON IN PERSEVERANCE FOR YEAR SIX FROM A NEW TEACHER WHOSE MENTAL LOOKS ON IT MAY BE EASIER FOR A CHAIN OR FEDERATION TO PROVIDE THIS KIND OF SUPPORT RATHER THAN A SMALL PRIMARY ON ITS OWN THAT WAY IT'S EASIER TO ATTRACT NEW STAFF BUT ONLY IF THEY'RE BIG ENOUGH
ACCORDING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE EARLY FOUNDATION HUGH GREENWAY HE SAYS A TRUST WILL STRUGGLE UNLESS IT HAS AT LEAST FIVE THOUSAND PUPILS IF YOU THINK OF THE AVERAGE PRIMARY SCHOOLS BEING A BIT LIKE A CAUTION
IT RELIES UPON A SYSTEM OUTSIDE ITSELF IT BUYS IT BECAUSE FROM THE CASH AND CARRY IT HAS A SUPPLY CHAIN BUT IT DEPENDS UPON WHAT HAS THE LARGER PEOPLE IN THAT INDUSTRY SAINSBURY'S THE SOMERFIELD TO THE WAITROSE IS AND EVERYTHING ELSE MANAGE IT THEMSELVES IF WE MOVE TO AN ACADEMY
WORLD WHERE THERE ARE NO LARGE CHAINS THEN WE'VE PROBABLY FRAGMENTED TEETH
IF WE MOVE TO ACADEMY WORLD REGIONAL SCHOOLS COMMISSIONERS MIGHT HAVE SCHOOLS HAVE CHANGED TO OVERSEE THERE'D BE OVERWHELMED HUGH GREENWAY BELIEVES AND SAYS IT'S VITAL THAT OFSTED INSPECTOR AND GRADE OF THE CHAINS THEMSELVES NOT JUST THEIR SCHOOLS WHAT HOUSE WE GET BETTER AS A SYSTEM
THE PRINCIPAL FUNCTION OF OUR STEAD IS TWO TO IDENTIFY FAILURE AND SUCCESS AND TO INFORM THE SYSTEM SO THAT BOTH THE OPERATORS IN THE SYSTEM BUT ALSO PARENTS NO
WHAT IS WORKING AND ALSO WHAT IS NOT WORKING OR LEE TABLE YES I THINK I SAID TO YOU IF WE KNEW WE WERE IN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE POSITIONS IN TERMS OF THE VALUE ADD WE'RE PROVIDING TO OUR CHILDREN THEN WE CAN PERHAPS
TAKE A BIT MORE RISK WE CAN BE A BIT MORE INNOVATIVE WE CAN WE CAN LOOK FOR THE NEXT BIG IDEA LAST MONTHS SIR MICHAEL WILSHAW SENT THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION A FORMAL NOTE WARNING ABOUT PROBLEMS IN SEVEN ACADEMY CHAINS
AND ANOTHER FLAGSHIP TRUST HERE IN BIRMINGHAM WAS RECENTLY HIT BY FINANCIAL SCANDAL
EVEN THE STRONGEST SUPPORTERS OF ACADEMIES SO THE SYSTEM OF OVERSIGHT WILL HAVE TO CHANGE IF EVERY SCHOOL IS TO BECOME AN ACADEMY
SANCHA BOOK REPORT IN THERE SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN A FORTNIGHT TOMORROW MANY OF US WILL BE VOTING IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS LONDONERS WILL BE CHOOSING A NEW MAYOR AND THE POLLS SAY LABOURS IN THE LEAD BUT THE GREEN PARTIES IN THERE FIGHTING TO AND I'M JOINED BY THEIR CANDIDATE FROM BERWICK FOR THE LATEST MALE ORAL OR WOULD BE MAY ORAL INTERVIEWS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
AND I GOT AN EMAIL THIS MORNING TELLING ME THAT THE GREENS ARE PLEDGING MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS TO UNLOCK LONDON CYCLING POTENTIAL A LOT OF MONEY WAS IT COMING FROM WELL IT'S MONEY THAT WE WE CURRENTLY ARE PAINTING IN THE CYCLIC IN THEIR TRANSPORT INVESTMENT BUDGET BORIS JOHNSON'S PLANS INCLUDE A STEEP DECLINE AND WE'RE JUST SEEING THE START OF QUITE A REVOLUTION THAT WOULD YOU OVERDUE IN LONDON
IN A SAFE PROTECTED SEPARATED CYCLE ROUTES AND WHERE THESE ARE BEING BUILT THEY'RE INCREDIBLY POPULAR THE ONE ON VAUXHALL OR SEEN A SEVENTY THREE PERCENT INCREASE IN CYCLIC JUST SINCE IT OPENED NOT VERY LONG AGO
AND THE ACTUAL EFFECT ON MOTOR TRAFFIC IN THE AREA HAS BEEN NEGLIGIBLE ALL THESE PREDICTIONS THAT THE GUID LUCK AREN'T COMING TRUE SO WE NEED TO KEEP THIS PROGRAMME GOING AND WHAT WE'RE PLEDGING TO DO IS TO KEEP THAT PROGRAMME GOING FINISH THE ENTIRE CYCLING VISION THAT BORIS JOHNSON SET OUT IN TERMS OF SUPERHIGHWAYS MAKE SURE THE OUTER LONDON GETS THESE AS WELL
DO PEOPLE FRIENDLY WALKING AND CYCLING IN TOWN CENTRE PROJECTS IN EVERY BARREL OF THAT ADDS UP TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION AND ONE OF US LAWYERS BUT IT'S IT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO THINGS LIKE ROAD BUILDING PROJECT THE SILVERTOWN TUNNEL WHICH NEEDS TO BE CANCELLED THAT'S A BILLION POUNDS ON IT WHAT IS IT WHAT IS THE SINGLE MAIN REASON FOR WANTING US TO CYCLE THE SINGLE BIGGEST REASON FOR WANTING US TO CYCLE WE HAVE A CONGESTION AND AIR POLLUTION PROBLEM IN LONDON
WE HAVE ISN'T IT I THINK I THINK IT'S THE EFFICIENT USE OF SPACE BUT BUT HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY THAT IN CASE TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM THE SORTS OF ROAD BUILDING SCHEMES THAT MIGHT IMPROVE THE EFFICIENT USE OF ROAD SPACE WE'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY OVER MANY YEARS THAT BUILDING MORE ROAD SPACE DOESN'T RELIEVE CONGESTION ACTUALLY THAT GREAT SPACE JUST FILLED UP WITH NEW TRAFFIC IF YOU END UP BACK WHERE YOU STARTED SHIFTING PEOPLE TO WALKING AND CYCLING NOT ONLY USES THE SPACE SO MUCH BETTER
IT ALSO MAKES PEOPLE HEALTHIER I MEAN THE ACTUAL PENS THEY'RE BREATHING WHILE THEY ARE CYCLING BUT IF YOU'RE NOT EMITTING ANY POLICE WHILE YOU'RE CYCLING NO HE'S GREAT YOU'RE BREATHING IN THE ATLAS ENOUGH THAT'S THE POINT AND IF YOU'RE REALLY CONCERNED BY AIR POLLUTION WHICH OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THEN YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT DIESEL HAVEN'T YOU YOU DO SO WE'VE GOT FAR TOO MANY CARS IN LONDON THAT ARE DRIVING ON DIESEL ENGINES THAT'S A MISTAKE THAT WE'VE MADE TO THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE INTO LOT REGULATION
THE CAR MAKERS ARE SAY CULPABLE FOR THIS THEY'VE BEEN CHEATING ON THEIR EMISSIONS TEST PRETENDING THAT THE DIESEL CARS ARE CLEANER THAN THEY ARE SO HE'S TAKE URGENT ACTION ON DIESEL CARS I MEAN THIS DOES MEAN PUTTING UP THE CONGESTION CHARGE THE EXISTING CONGESTION CHARGE FOR DIESEL CARS GIVING PEOPLE A STRONG INCENTIVE HOW MUCH A SWITCH TO PETROL
I HAVE SET UP TEA AT LEAST TWENTY TWENTY DOUBLING INTO ALONE IF YOU DRIVE A DIESEL CAR DOUBLING IT AND GIVING PEOPLE A STRONG INCENTIVE YOU DURING THEIR PEDAL CAR OWN OF THOUGH SHE REALISE I THINK I MEAN I THINK THE DIESEL CAR RADIOS ARE VERY HARD DONE BY I'M SUPPORTING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE CAR MAKERS FOR THIS BECAUSE LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE INCENTIVISED TO BUY DIESEL CARS SHOULD BE COMPENSATED BUT IF YOU HAVE ONE WE NEED A STRONG INCENTIVE FOR YOU TO SWITCH TO PETROL BRING A DIFFERENT CAR INTO LONDON BECAUSE I
HE'S ABSOLUTELY FILTHY WHEN YOU DOING MAKING A DIFFERENT CAR INTO THAT THERE AREN'T MANY PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT ANOTHER CAR IN THE GARAGE THEY CAN WHIP UP BECAUSE YOU'VE TOLD THEM THEY CAN'T GROW THEIR DIESEL THEY WON'T THEY WILL NEED TO BUY A DIFFERENT SOAP SHARE A CAR WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT A PETROL CAR THESE INCENTIVES DO WORK AND NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP WE SHOULD HAVE MET THE LEGAL LIMITS SET BY THE EUROPEAN UNION BY TWENTY TEN AND WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE ALL OVER LONDON WHERE
THE GREEN PARTY ARE TESTING THE AIR IN COMMUNITY SCIENCE PROJECTS ACROSS LONDON AND WE'RE FINDING THAT EVEN IN HIGHGATE WHERE I REPRESENT OUT IN THE OUTER LONDON AREAS OF EALING KINGSTON WE HAVE NOT GOT ANY
THAT'S WITHIN LEGAL LIMITS VIRTUALLY WHERE PETE PEOPLE WALK TO SCHOOL WHERE PEOPLE SHOP IT'S AN ABSOLUTE SCANDAL JUST COOK AND I'M AFRAID HISTORY TELLS YOU DOESN'T IT THAT THIS SORT OF CAMPAIGNING WILL WIN NEW NICHE VOTE BUT HE WON'T WIN YOU THE ELECTION PEOPLE HAVE RATED MY PLANS FOR A HOUSING VERY HIGHLY WON THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR PRIVATE RENTERS FOR EXAMPLE I AM A PRIVATE RENTER
I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT WE DO HAVE THAT INTEGRATED PLANTS THE PLANS THAT REALLY SOLVE LONDON'S CRISES AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN POLITICS PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH THE SO CALLED TWO HORSE RACE THE NEGATIVITY OF THE DEBATES THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FOR US CHARLES THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED

RADIO FOUR WEBSITE

WOULD DAMAGE THE U.K. AND REDUCE OUR INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE THAT'S IN AN HOUR I'LL BE CONSIDERING HOW MUCH C. C. T. V.

EIGHT A FORMER AMERICAN TREASURY SECRETARIES HAVE WADED INTO THE DEBATE OVER BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP THEY SAY A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD REPRESENT A RISKY BET ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC FUTURE AND DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON OR BOTH ONE RESOUNDING VICTORIES IN THE LATEST CONTEST TO CHOOSE THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY'S NEWS IS READ BY CAROLINE NICHOLS
PRINCE WILLIAM HAS ATTEMPTED TO SHRUG OFF CRITICISM OF HIS COMMITMENT TO HIS ROYAL DUTIES SO HE'S CURRENTLY CONCENTRATING ON HIS ROLE AS A FATHER AND HIS JOB AS AN AIR AMBULANCE PILOT BUT HE'S ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO TAKE ON MORE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THE TIME COMES IN A B. B. C. INTERVIEW THAT YOU CAMBRIDGE ALSO DESCRIBED THE INCREDIBLE INSIGHTS HE'D GAINED FROM OBSERVING THE QUEEN WHOSE NINETIETH BIRTHDAY IT IS TOMORROW HE SPOKE TO OUR ROYAL CORRESPONDENT NICHOLAS WITCHELL
THE QUEEN SENSE OF DUTY HER SERVICE HER COMMITMENT TO OTHERS HAD ALL BEEN IN WILLIAM'S WORDS ARE GUIDING EXAMPLE OF WHAT A GOOD MONARCH SHOULD BE HIS OWN COMMITMENT TO ROYAL DUTY HAS BEEN QUESTIONED IN SOME QUARTERS IN RECENT MONTHS THERE HAVE BEEN HEADLINES IN SOME NEWSPAPERS WHICH HAVE REFER TO HIM AS WORKSHY WILLIAM THEY WERE CRITICISMS WHICH HE SAID HE DIDN'T IGNORE BUT WHICH HE DIDN'T TAKE COMPLETELY TO HEART
I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY I TAKE MY RESPONSIBILITIES VERY SERIOUSLY
BUT IT'S IT'S ABOUT FINDING YOUR OWN WAY AT THE RIGHT TIME AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL YOU CAN SO WEAR YOU DOWN FOR A LOT
AT A VERY EARLY AGE I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO DEVELOP INTO THE DUTY ROLL WILLIAM EMPHASISED THE IMPORTANCE HE ATTACHED TO HIS ROLE AS AN AIR AMBULANCE PILOT AND AT THE TIME HE SPENDS WITH HIS FAMILY HE SAID THAT BOTH HIS FATHER AND HIS GRANDMOTHER SUPPORTED THE FACT THAT HE'S NOT YET FULLY ENGAGED WITH ROYAL DUTIES BUT THAT WHEN THE TIME CAME TO ACCEPT MORE RESPONSIBILITIES HE WOULD BE THE FIRST PERSON HE SAID TO PUT UP HIS HAND AND TAKE THEM ON
EIGHT FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARIES HAVE WARNED BRITISH VOTERS THAT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS A RISKY BET WRITING IN THE TIMES THE MEN WHO RUN AMERICAN FINANCES GOING BACK AS FAR AS PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON SAY THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES HAS BENEFITED FROM HAVING A STRONG BRITAIN WITHIN EUROPE

THE ONE THAT FOR IT COULD CALL INTO QUESTION LONDON'S ROYAL AS A FINANCIAL CENTRE AND CLAIM AT THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY IS ALREADY HOLDING BACK INVESTMENT AND THE EIGHT INCLUDE TO MY RECENT TREASURY SECRETARY TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND POLLO NEWELL WHO SERVED UNDER THE SECOND PRESIDENT BUSH ARGUE THAT A BRITISH DECISION TO LEAVE COULD BOOST WHAT THEY TERM POPULIST ANTI E.U. MOVEMENTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES

IF YOU DO THAT YOU'RE QUITE A GOOD JOB MANAGING ITS MONEY WHEN IT COMES TO ITS GENERAL AID PROGRAMME WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THEY COULD DO A BETTER JOB WHEN THEY'RE DEALING WITH CRISES BECAUSE THAT'S BECOMING A BIGGER PART OF THEIR WORK THEIR FOCUS IS OFF TO SEE OBVIOUSLY I'M GETTING HELP AT THE TIME WE'RE SAYING YOU NEED TO EVALUATE BETTER WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT SO THAT THE NEXT CRISIS THAT COMES UP YOU KNOWING FOR SURE YOU GETTING BETTER VALUE FOR THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY
A SENIOR DIRECTORATE TATA STEEL IS FORMING A MANAGEMENT BUY OUT TEAM TO START THE PROCESS OF BIDDING TO TAKE OVER THE COMPANY'S U.K. OPERATION WHICH EMPLOYS FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IT'S BELIEVED THE DEAL WOULD INVOLVE STILL MAKING CONTINUING AT PORT TALBOT DESPITE ITS HUGE LOSSES MORE DETAILS FROM A WHALE'S CORRESPONDENT HOW GRIFFITH
THE PROPOSED MANAGEMENT BUY OUT WOULD BE LED BY STUART WILKIE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF TARTAR STRIP PRODUCT IT WOULD INVOLVE KEEPING PORT TALBOT'S BLAST FURNACES FIRING RATHER THAN SWITCH INTO THE MODEL OF RECYCLING STEEL SUGGESTED BY THE ONLY OTHER COMPANY TO MAKE THEIR INTEREST PUBLIC LIBERTY HOUSE
BUT ANY DEAL WOULD DEPEND ON FINDING INVESTORS WILLING TO WAIT FOR STEEL PRODUCTION TO BECOME PROFITABLE AGAIN
IT'S UNDERSTOOD MANAGERS WOULD ASK EMPLOYEES TO HELP FINANCE THE COMPANY WITH THEIR OWN MONEY AS WELL AS SEEKING LARGE LARGER PRIVATE INVESTMENT
PUBLIC MONEY WOULD ALSO BE NEEDED THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT WOULD CONSIDER BEING A CO INVESTOR PUTTING CASH ON COMMERCIAL TERMS
A BRITISH TOURIST WHO DISAPPEARED IN PERU NEARLY TWO WEEKS AGO HAS BEEN FOUND DEAD HARRY GRACE'S BODY WAS DISCOVERED IN A GREEK CREVICE IN THE ANDES MOUNTAINS MY GREAVES FROM OSWESTRY IN SHROPSHIRE HAD LAST BEEN SEEN WHEN HE SET OFF FOR A SOLO HIKE FROM THE VILLAGE OF PEACE SAC AROUND FIFTY MILES FROM MUCH OF PEACHES
THE WORLD'S LARGEST COMPUTER CHIP MAKER INTEL HAS ANNOUNCED IT SHEDDING TWELVE THOUSAND JOBS GLOBALLY ELEVEN PERCENT OF ITS WORKFORCE THE U.S. COMPANY SAID IT WAS RESTRUCTURING TO TRY TO REDUCE ITS RELIANCE ON THE DECLINING PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET
NEW RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT PARTICIPATING IN AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES HELPS CHILDREN FROM POOR BACKGROUNDS AND ENGLAND ACHIEVE HIGHER MARKS AN ACADEMIC LESSONS THE STUDY OF MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PUPILS FOUND THE GAP IN TEST PERFORMANCE BETWEEN POORER AND BETTER OFF CHILDREN WAS NEARLY HALVED IN THOSE THAT TOOK PART IN TWO SUCH CLUBS A WEEK DOCTOR EMILE TANNER IS FROM THE INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION AND LEAD THE STUDY SHE SAID THERE WERE MANY ADVANTAGES
AFTER SCHOOL CLUBS WITH THE ONLY ACTIVITY WHERE CHILDREN FOR MORE AFFLUENT AND DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS PARTICIPATED TO THE SAME EXTENT
IT'S PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN WHO WOULDN'T OTHERWISE GET THAN PROBABLY WE FOUND THAT THOSE AND EFFECTS OF TAKING PART AND OUT OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES ON ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL OUTCOMES AND THIS SUGGESTS THAT IT'S HELPING CHILDREN WITH THEIR LEARNING WHICH THEY MAY WELL BEN CARRY BACK INTO THE CLASS
A MAJOR TRIALISTS TO START IN SCOTLAND AIMED AT PREVENTING TYPE ONE DIABETES IN CHILDREN WITH THE HISTORY OF THE DISEASE IN THEIR FAMILY THEIR STUDY LED BY RESEARCHERS FROM THE UNIVERSITIES OF EXETER AND DUNDEE COULD CHALLENGE LONG ESTABLISHED THINKING ABOUT WHAT CAUSES THE CONDITION WHICH AFFECTS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE U.K. HERE'S OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM
TYPE ONE DIABETES DEVELOPS WHEN THE BODY DOESN'T PRODUCE INSULIN DESPITE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH THERE'S NO WAY OF PREVENTING IT AND NO CURE IT'S USUALLY SEEN AS A FAULT IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH ATTACKS AND DESTROYS INSULIN PRODUCING BETA CELLS IN THE PANCREAS THE RESEARCHERS NEST STUDY PLANT TO CONTACT NEARLY SIX AND A HALF THOUSAND FAMILIES IN SCOTLAND AFFECTED BY THE CONDITION TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN AT HIGH RISK
THEY'LL TEST WHETHER GIVING SOME OF THEM ARE DRUG CALLED MET IN WHICH PROTECTS BETA CELLS FROM STRESS WILL PREVENT THIS IMMUNE RESPONSE SO THEY CONTINUE TO PRODUCE INSULIN
EDINBURGH MY REPORT IN THERE THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WELL WE'RE INTO THE REALLY BIG PRIMARY ELECTIONS IN THE LONG RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY IT WAS NEW YORK AND THE BIG QUESTION WAS NOT SO MUCH WHO WOULD WIN THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH ASSUME BUT WHO WOULD WIN CONVINCINGLY WELL IN THE FINAL RUN UP THERE WERE IMPORTANT WINS AND THEY WERE BIG WINGS CONVINCING WINS FOR DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON AS NICK BRYANT REPORTS
GENTLEMEN PLEASE
I KNOW IT'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
MISTER OCADO JANUS SPREAD AND DONALD TRUMP CAME TO THE PODIUM WITH BIG APPLE SWAGGER FRANK SINATRA'S GREAT ANTHEM ECHOING AROUND THE ATRIUM OF THE SKYSCRAPER THAT THERE'S THE BILLIONAIRES
NO PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME THE BEST THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK WHEN THEY GIVE US THIS KIND OF A VOTE AND IT'S JUSTINE
BECAUSE THIS WAS A TOWERING VICTORY HE CAPTURED OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF HIS HOME STATES VOTE
THAT GIVES HIM A BIG DELEGATE HALL AND NUDGES HIM CLOSER TO THE NUMBER HE NEEDS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN TO SECURE THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A RACE ANY MORE BASED ON WHAT I'M SEEING ON TELEVISION SET AT THE CRUISER'S JUST
ALMOST MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR TECH CREWS TO WIN ON THE FIRST BALLOT AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE RACES OVER THE TEXAN SENATOR IS HOPING TO DEPRIVE TRUMP OF THE DELEGATES HE NEEDS TO WIN OUTRIGHT TO PRODUCE WHAT'S CALLED A CONTEST IT
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE HILARY CALLING
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE A HOME COMING WIN FOR NEW YORK'S FORMER SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON
WHICH REINFORCE THE FRONT RUNNER STATUS AFTER A STRING OF DEFEATS TO HER RIVAL
YOU PROVED ONCE AGAIN THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE
HER HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER CHELSEA AT HER SIDE SHE LAUGHED AND SMILED BROADLY AND NO WONDER IT'S NOW ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR SANDERS TO OVERHAUL HER LEAD RACE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IS IN THE HEART
WAS THE KNIFE AT THE FRONT RUNNERS DOUBLE DROP WINNING IN THE STATE OF HIS BIRTH
HILLARY CLINTON SECURING A COMFORTABLE VICTORY IN HER ADOPTED POLITICAL HOME IT REALLY WAS A CASE OF NEW YORK
GIANT REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WELL AS WE HAD IN THE NEWS A MAJOR TRIAL HAS BEEN LAUNCHED IN SCOTLAND TO TRY TO PREVENT TYPE ONE DIABETES IN CHILDREN
IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL IT WOULD TURN LONG ESTABLISHED THINKING ABOUT THE DISEASE ON ITS HEAD IN CLOTHING WHETHER IT IS EVEN AN AUTO IMMUNE DISEASE WELL TERENCE WILKIN IS PROFESSOR OF ENDOCRINOLOGY AT EXETER UNIVERSITY IN THE CHIEF INVESTIGATOR OF THE STUDY AND HE JOINS US FROM DUNDEE NOW GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR WELCOME GOOD MORNING CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE THINKING IS BEHIND THIS IDEA AND AT THIS PARTICULAR THAT STUDY
THIS IS A STUDY WHICH IS CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF EXETER IN COLLABORATION WITH DUNDEE AND WHAT IT WILL TRY TO ACHIEVE IS A PREVENTION BUT USING A NOVEL INTERPRETATION OF OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR MANY YEARS
TYPE ONE DIABETES IS CHARACTERISED BY AN IMMUNE RESPONSE AND THAT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME BUT WHAT OVER MANY YEARS THAT IMMUNE RESPONSE HAS BEEN INTERPRETED AS A FAULTY IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKING THE CELLS THAT MAKE INSULIN THE SO CALLED PETER SELLS FOR
REASONS THAT ARE NOT BEEN IT'S BEEN CLEAR WHAT THE ACCELERATOR HYPOTHESIS ON WATCH THIS NEW TRIAL IS BASED IS SUGGESTING IS THAT
THE PROBLEM DOESN'T LIE WITH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IT MADE LIE WITH THE BEE TO SELL ITSELF WHICH IN A MODERN ENVIRONMENT IS BEING OVER STRESSED THAT HIS BEING INTO DEMANDS TO PRODUCE INSULIN ARE TWO GREAT NOW AND THAT A STRESSED BEAT HERSELF SENDS OUT SIGNALS TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH THEN REACTS WITH THAT INTERPRETATION WERE CORRECT IT WOULD MEAN THAT TREATING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT WAY FORWARD BUT PROTECTING THE PETER SERVE LOCATES THE STRESS IN THE FIRST PLACE
MAY PREVENT THE PROBLEM OCCURRING AT ALL O.K. COS IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN ASSUMED THAT TYPE ONE DIABETES WOULD CLASSED WITH OTHER AUTO IMMUNE TYPE DISEASES WHERE EFFECTIVELY THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WAS
PRO ACTIVE IN CAUSING IT AND YOU'RE SUGGESTING ACTUALLY WE'VE WE'VE ASSUMED THAT BUT WE'VE BEEN WRONG IN THAT BECAUSE INSTEAD THIS IS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM REACTING INDEED A DEVIANT SYSTEM IS VERY CLEARLY ACTIVE AND OVERLY ACTIVE IN TYPE ONE DIABETES IT'S WHERE IT STANDS IN THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT WE'RE QUESTIONING HOW QUICKLY WILL YOU ESTABLISH FROM THIS STUDY WHETHER YOUR THEORY'S RIGHT CLINICAL TRIALS I'M AFRAID TAKE A LONG LONG TIME AND IT'LL PROBABLY BE SIX OR SEVEN YEARS WE HAVE BEFORE WE HAVE A FINAL ANSWER AS TO WHETHER WE CAN REDUCE THE INCIDENCE
OF TYPE ONE DIABETES WITH THIS TRIAL BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY FAIRLY CONVINCED THAT IT WILL SHOW THAT WELL I HAVE TO BE OPTIMISTIC AND HAVE BEEN FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN DIFFICULTIES WITH THE PREVENTION OF THIS DISEASE IT'S INCREASED FIVEFOLD IN THE PAST FORTY YEARS OR SO WE DON'T HAVE A MEANS OF PREVENTING IT AND IT'S NOT A PLEASANT CONDITION FOR A CHILD TO GROW UP KNOWING THAT THAT IS A DISEASE FOR LIFE AND INJECTIONS ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED EVERY DAY
AND IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND IT IS THAT THE BETA CELL IS BEING STRESSED BY I THINK YOU SAID MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WHAT COULD WE DO ABOUT IT THEN AS A TREATMENT WELL WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO PROTECT IT IN A GENERAL WAY GENERIC MANNER IF YOU LIKE USING A MEDICATION TO PROTECT THE BEAT HERSELF FROM THE STRESS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE STRESS FACTORS AREN'T THEY COULD BE VERY MULTIPLE
THAT FOR THE MOMENT IT'S NOT THE QUESTION THE QUESTION WE'RE ASKING IS WHETHER BY PROTECTING THAT BE TO SELL WE CAN PREVENT THE PROBLEMS OF ITS LIMITED SURVIVAL AND OF ITS PROFIT PROVOKING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO REACT IN THE WAY IT DOES WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING HOW IT GOES PROFESSOR TERENCE WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ON THEIR NEW FIGURES OUT THIS MORNING SHOWING THAT HOUSE BUILDING IN THIS COUNTRY IS SLOWING DOWN THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S MEANT TO BE DOING TIME
SIMON MATTHEW I'VE GONE BACK A BIT IN THE PAST YEAH ABSOLUTELY WELL TRY TO EMULATE THE GREAT SIMON JACK THIS OF COURSE IS BAD NEWS U.K. HOUSE BUILDING SLOWING BAD NEWS NOT JUST FOR BUSINESS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BUT BUT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE RICHARD HILL HE'S A YOUNG PROFESSIONAL HE'S ALMOST THIRTY HE'S LIVING WITH HIS PARENTS AFTER COMING BACK FROM UNIVERSITY
THE WORK WAS WORKING IN LONDON I'M JUST BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I CAN BEHOLD GOODBYE PARTICULARLY IN LONDON THERE'S MANY
LIVING AT HOME COMING UP SOCIETY IT'S NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION I'M SURE
TRY AND GET AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE HE IS ONE OF MANY THE ROYAL INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS SAYS THIS MORNING THAT GROWTH IN THE PRIVATE HOUSING SECTOR SLOW DOWN CONSIDERABLY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR RICK'S HEAD OF POLICY JEREMY BLACKBURN IS HERE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING IS THIS A LACK OF WILLINGNESS ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY OR IS IT A LACK OF LAND
WHAT OUR MEMBERS SURVEILLANCE HAVE BEEN QUITE CLEAR IN THE FEEDBACK IN THIS SURVEY THEY FOUND THE PLANNING SYSTEM AND LACK OF LAND CERTAINLY SHOULD BE IMPACTED OVER THE LAST QUARTER BEFORE THAT IN THAT LAST YEAR I THINK SOME OF THIS IS VERY MUCH THE THE AMOUNT OF LAND WE CAN GET INTO THE SYSTEM PARTICULARLY BRADFIELD AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT IS THAT LOCAL AUTHORITY OR GOVERNMENT
IT'S A MIXTURE OF BOTH IN THE CENTRE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BEING QUICK ENOUGH TO GET LAND INTO THE SYSTEM BUT ALSO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HELPING WITH SEWING APPROPRIATE FUNSTER TO HELP GET THAT BROWNFIELD LAND BACK UP TO SPEC OR IT'S PREVIOUSLY BEEN INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY SO WHEN GEORGE OSBORNE SAYS THE LAST PARTY CONFERENCE WE ARE THE BUILDERS AS FAR AS YOUR MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED HE'S NOT DOING ENOUGH TO MAKE CONDITIONS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE BUILDERS
THAT'S RIGHT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT COMING THROUGH IN THIS QUARTER AND THERE'S DEFINITELY MORE THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO EVEN EVEN THOUGH IT'S MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS TO SAY INFRASTRUCTURE SO IF YOU SORTED OUT THE PLANNING PROCESS SORTED OUT THE AVAILABILITY OF LAND WOULD THAT THEN SORT OUT THE PROBLEMS
WHAT SURVEYS ALSO SAID IN THE SURVEY WAS THAT THAT BEING CONSTRAINED BY LACK OF LABOUR LIKE LABOUR ARTICULATE PARTICULARLY IN THE TRAITS BUT WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT RECORD IMMIGRATION INTO THIS COUNTRY AND WE KNOW THAT AN AWFUL LOT OF THE PEOPLE COMING IN ESPECIALLY FROM PARTS OF EUROPE ARE COMING INTO WORK IN TRAITS LIKE BUILDING
OVERALL THOUGH WE WE LOST A RECORD NUMBER OF PEOPLE SKILLED PEOPLE DURING THE RECESSION FROM CONSTRUCTION AND THEN ALSO AN AGEING WORKFORCE MANY OF WHOM MIGHT HAVE STAYED ON DURING SEE THAT RECESSION OUT AND ARE NOW RETIRING THAT'S BEEN A BIT OF A DOUBLE CLIFF IN TERMS OF LABOUR SHORTAGE SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OVERALL OF THOSE SKILLED PROFESSIONALS ALL RIGHT WELL JEREMY BLACKBURN FROM RICK'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE
MATTHEW THANK YOU VERY MUCH NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW THE BOSS OF TATA STEEL'S PORT ALBERT PLANT IS PLANNING A MANAGEMENT BUY OUT OF THE COMPANY IN THE U.K. IS CALLED STUART WILKIE AND HERE'S THE MAN WHO PUT TOGETHER THE SURVIVAL PLAN THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE TARTAR BOARD IN INDIA SO IS IT A RUNNER COULD HE BE ANY MORE SUCCESSFUL THEY WERE DOCTOR CATHERINE RINGWALD AS A STEEL ANALYST RECENTLY RETIRED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH WALES AND SHE JOINS US ON THE NIGHT THAT MY DOCTORING WORLD COULD BUY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS PROPOSAL
INDEED BUT ONE OF THINGS WE HEARD IS THAT THIS IS A BUSINESS THAT'S LOSING A MILLION POUNDS A DAY IN PORT ALBERT WATCH CHAIN WHAT HOW'D AT WHAT CHANGES ABOUT THAT
YOU SOUND QUITE SUITS I I MAKE IT HELP RAB OF EXPECTATION I AM HOPEFUL I THINK UP TO A GOOD BIT TOGETHER PUT HER PUT HER BUT I'VE SEEN A SIMILAR PLAN
JUST A BIG THOUGHT IS IT THE BIGGEST IS IT MUST BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST MANAGEMENT BUY OUTS IF IT GOES AHEAD YES IT IS WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING ON THIS SCALE IN THE U.K. FOR A LIP FOR HER WHY
IF WE CONVINCE DOCTOR CATHERINE MADE MUD WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH O.K. TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN THIS PROBABLY WILL COME AS A GREAT SURPRISE TO YOU BUT THE QUEEN HIS MIGHTY TOMORROW
HER GRANDSON PRINCE WILLIAM HAS BEEN TALKING TO OUR ROYAL CORRESPONDENT NICHOLAS WITCHELL WHO'S WITH ME HE'S QUITE OUTSPOKEN QUITE FRANK REALLY
IT'S QUITE REVEALING IS QUITE REVEALING ALSO ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS OF WHAT KIND OF KING HE WILL BE BUT OF COURSE TO BEGIN WITH WE TALKED ABOUT HIS GRANDMOTHER ABOUT HER SENSE OF DUTY WHICH BROUGHT US TO THE INEVITABLE QUESTION DOES HE SHARE THAT DEGREE OF DEVOTION TO DUTY THE CRITICISMS THAT HE HAS FACED IN RECENT WEEKS AT THAT HE IS IN SOME WAY WORK SHY BUT HE'S NOT PULLING HIS WEIGHT
HE SAYS I TAKE DUTY VERY SERIOUSLY BUT TWO THINGS ARE VERY CLEAR FROM THIS INTERVIEW THAT IS THAT HE DOES NOT WISH TO BE A ROYAL ON A PEDESTAL AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM TO HAVE SOME SEMBLANCE OF NORMAL LIFE HE BELIEVES THAT IS IMPORTANT NOT LEAST BECAUSE HE WANTS TO KEEP THE MONARCHY RELEVANT WHEN HE IS KING IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM THAT HE HAS HIS ROLE AS AN AIR AMBULANCE HELICOPTER PILOT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM IT EMERGES IN THIS INTERVIEW
UNSURPRISING I SUPPOSE THE IMPORTANCE TO HIM OF BEING A GOOD PARENT I WANT TO BRING UP MY CHILDREN AS GOOD PEOPLE IF I CAN'T GIVE MY TIME TO MY CHILDREN AS WELL I WORRY ABOUT THEIR FUTURE THERE'S A STRONG EMPHASIS I THINK HERE FROM HIS MOTHER FROM FROM DIANA THAT HE AS I SAY DOESN'T WANT TO BE A ROYAL AND A PENCIL WE THEN WE LOOKED TO THE FUTURE AND THIS I THINK IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND REVEALING WHAT KIND OF KING WILL WILLIAM THE FIFTH BE
WILL HE FOLLOW THE MODEL OF HIS GRANDMOTHER STAYING VERY DIVORCED SEPARATE FROM ALL CURRENT ISSUES OR WILL HE BE TEMPTED BY THE PATH OF HIS FATHER AS PRINCE OF WALES OF COURSE NOT AS MUCH AS KING GETTING ARE VERY ENGAGED IN ISSUES WHICH PATH WILL HE FIND
IT'S SOMETHING THAT OCCUPIES A LOT OF MY THINKING SPACE
HOW ON EARTH YOU WOULD DEVELOP INTO SOMETHING MODERN TODAY'S
I TAKE A LOT OF THEM IN A UNIQUE POSITION ACTUALLY VERY PRIVILEGED POSITION TO BE ABLE TO TO SEE SOME OF US NOW WHICH IS THAT I'VE GOT MY GRANDMOTHER WHO TAKES A VERY IF YOU LIKE
MORE OF A PASSIVE ROLE IN HOW SHE BELIEVES HER ROLE SHOULD BE SHE'S SHE'S ABOVE POLITICS SHE'S VERY MUCH AWAY FROM IT ALL AND IT KEEPS IT WAS ALL RIGHT
I'VE GOT MY FATHER WHO REMINDS AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT MANY OF THE CAUSES EVOLVED IN AND I THINK IN THE QUEEN I HAVEN'T EXTRAORDINARY EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO IS
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GOOD MY HANDS WHICH IS PROBABLY THE BEST ROLE MODEL I COULD HAVE IN FRONT
LICK THAT YOU MENTIONED THE WORKSHY THING A MINUTE AGO DID YOU PUT IT IN DIRECTLY EASY WORKSHOP I DIRECTLY HAVE YOU SAY YOU WILL HAVE SEEN OR YOU WILL HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE STORIES THE HEADLINES THAT YOU ARE WORK SHY WILLIAM AND HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT AND HIS RESPONSES THAT WELL
I'M GOING TO GET LOTS OF CRITICISM OVER MY LIFETIME IT'S SOMETHING THAT I DON'T COMPLETELY IGNORE BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING I TAKE COMPLETELY TO HEART AND THEN HE EXPLAINED THAT HE IS CONCENTRATING ON HIS ROLE AS A FATHER THE IMPORTANCE AS I'VE BEEN MENTIONING ALREADY OF THE AIR AMBULANCE ROLE AND I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO HIM BECAUSE HE WANTS TO SORT OF UNDERSTAND MODERN LIFE HE WANTS TO FEEL PART OF MODERN LIFE AND AGAIN THIS I THINK IS THE INFLUENCE OF OF HIS LATE MOTHER AND DOES IT THEREFORE WANT TO
MODERNISE THE MONARCHY WHATEVER WE MIGHT UNDERSTAND BY THAT AND ONE OTHER THING THAT I HAVE TO I DON'T KNOW THAT DO YOU THINK COME HIS SON KNOWS IT'S A QUALIFICATION COME TO THAT IN A MOMENT I WILL HE SAYS VERY DIRECTLY I THINK THE ROYAL FAMILY HAS TO MODERNISE AND DEVELOP AND REMAIN RELEVANT AND I THINK HE'S VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WILL FALL TO HIM TO ENSURE THAT IT IS RELEVANT AND STRONG IN TWENTY YEARS' TIME HE SAYS HE IS CONFIDENT THAT HE CAN ENSURE THAT IT IS
ON THE QUESTION OF GEORGE I ASKED HIM I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE KNOWS AT WHAT AGE HE STARTED TO REALISE THAT HE WASN'T PART OF A NORMAL FAMILY BUT I ASKED HIM HAS GEORGE IN ANY WAY STARTED TO APPRECIATE THAT HE IS NOT PART OF A NORMAL FAMILY THIS IS HIS ANSWER AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED WITHIN A SORT OF FAMILY THAT WE
I LOVE MY CHILDREN THE SAME WAY FATHER DOES AND I HOPE GEORGE LOVES ME THE SAME WAY ANY SON LOST HIS FATHER SO WE ARE VERY NORMAL IN THAT SENSE
GEORGE THERE'LL BE A TIME AND A PLACE TO TO BRING GEORGE UP AND UNDERSTAND HOW HE FITS IN THE WORLD
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST A CASE OF KEEPING A SECURE STABLE ENVIRONMENT AROUND HIM SHOWING AS MUCH LOVE AS A TRANSPLANT
THEY'LL LIE FOR A LIVING YEAH HE'S CONFIDENT BUT HE'S AWARE OF THIS CRITICISM BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO CHANGE HE FEELS IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE HIS LIFE AND KEEP CONTROL OF HIS LIFE NICK THANK YOU VERY MUCH

EIGHT FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARIES HAVE SIGNED AN ARTICLE IN THE TIMES WARNING AT THE RISK OF BRITAIN LEADING THE EUROPEAN UNION THE MEN HAVE SERVED PRESIDENT STRETCHING BACK TO NIXON SAY BRECHT'S IT COULD BE A DRAG ON GROWTH LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SAY THEY'RE ASKING BRITAIN TO DO SOMETHING AMERICA WOULDN'T EVER CONSIDER DOING ITSELF
DONALD TRUMP HAS CLAIMED HIS MAIN RIVAL TO BE THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TED CRUZ HAS BEEN JUST ABOUT MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED AFTER MISTER TRUMP'S VICTORY IN THE NEW YORK PRIMARY IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTEST HILLARY CLINTON COMFORTABLY BEAT BERNIE SANDERS SHE TOLD HER SUPPORTERS VICTORY WAS IN SIGHT
THE COMMONS PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE HAS RAISED CONCERNS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT FULLY KNOW WHERE THE AID BUDGET IS BEING SPENT THE GROUP OF M.P.S SAYS THERE'S A POTENTIAL LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY SURROUNDING MONEY FOR HUMANITARIAN CRISES WHICH IS CHANNELLED VIA UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES WHICH THE COMMITTEE SAYS ARE OFTEN INVOLVED IN TURF WARS WITH EACH OTHER
A MANAGEMENT BUY OUT FOR TATA'S STEEL MAKING BUSINESS IN THE U.K. HAS BEEN PROPOSED THE SITES WERE PUT UP FOR SALE LAST MONTH RAISING FEARS OF THOUSANDS OF JOB LOSSES IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT IF THE BUYOUT WENT AHEAD IT WOULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THE BODY OF A BRITISH TOURIST WHO'S BEEN MISSING IN THE PERUVIAN ANDES FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS HAS BEEN DISCOVERED HARRY GREAVES WAS FOUND DEAD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE
THE PROGRAMME WHICH IT IS HOPED COULD REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF TYPE ONE DIABETES IS TO BE TRIALLED IN SCOTLAND IT WILL INVOLVE TESTING WHETHER GIVING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AFFECTED BY THE CONDITION OF PARTICULAR DRUG ENABLES THEM TO CONTINUE PRODUCING INSULIN RESEARCHERS SAY IT'S POTENTIALLY A COST EFFECTIVE AND IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE MEANS OF HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING THE CONDITION
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT FOR YEARS WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT VIOLENT CRIME IS FALLING BUT THE LATEST FIGURES SUGGEST IT'S BOTTOMING OUT THE LONG STEADY DECLINE IN VIOLENCE IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS COME TO AN END ACCORDING TO A STUDY OF FIGURES FROM HOSPITAL A. AND E. UNITS MIGHT THERE BE A LINK BETWEEN THAT AND THE FACT THAT THE POLICE ARE NOT MONITORING C. C. T. V. CAMERAS THE WAY THEY USED TO THAT'S WHAT RESEARCH FROM CARDIFF UNIVERSITY SUGGESTS I'M JOINED
FROM THAT TO UNIVERSITY INVITED PROFESSOR JONATHAN SHEPHERD WHO'S WRITTEN THE REPORT ON THAT VIOLENCE RESEARCH FOR THE VIOLENCE RESEARCH GROUP THERE AND BY DAVID WATSON WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF JUSTICE AND THE HEALTH NACRO PROFESSOR SHEPHERD
WHAT DOES THE YOUR OR YOUR REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THAT IT HAS BOTTOMED OUT AND YOUR EVIDENCE FOR THAT IS THE FIGURES THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM A.&E. UNIT IS THAT BROADLY RIGHT YES THE THE OVERALL TREND IS DOWNWARDS AND SAY WE MUSTN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING INTO ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES HAS FALLEN BY THIRTY PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN SO THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND FEWER
PEOPLE COMING INTO A ERNIE'S IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN COMPARED TO TWO THOUSAND TEN BUT THE THE DECREASES HAVE BEEN GETTING EVER SMALLER OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY REAL CHANGE SO THE SUGGESTION ALL THE INDICATIONS ARE STRONG INDICATION BOTH FROM THESE FIGURES AND FROM THE CRIME SURVEY FOR ENGLAND AND WALES IS THAT THIS IS THIS IS FALLERS AS MAY WELL HAVE BOTTOMED OUT
AND THE LINK WITH C.C.T.V. YES WELL WE WE KNOW THAT STREET C.C.T.V. AND LIVE MONITORING OF THOSE SCREENS ENABLES POLICE TO GET TO ARGUMENTS AND FIGHTS EARLIER AND MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WE OTHERWISE BE THE CASE AND THAT NIPS OR VIOLENCE IN THE BUDS AND EFFECTIVELY OVER VERY EFFECTIVELY KEEPS PEOPLE OUT OF HOSPITAL AND OF COURSE PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON AS WELL
AND ALSO CRIME ANALYSTS A SUFFERER OR MAYBE SUFFOLK MAY WELL BE SUFFERING THE SAME KIND OF FAITH IN THESE STRONG FINANCIAL PRESSURES THAT COUNCILS AND PLEASE HAVE TO FACE AND WE THINK THAT AT THIS THESE THINGS SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS BACKROOM FUNCTIONS
AND SOMEHOW DISPENSABLE THAT THEY ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT IN SCIENTIFIC POLICING AND CRIME REDUCTION AND KEEPING THE LID ON THE VIOLENCE AND KEEPING IT GOING DOWN AS IT HAS DONE SO MEMORABLY SHE COULD YOU DO THAT MISTER WATSON
WHELK CLEARLY WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THE PROVISION OF SERVICES THAT HELP PEOPLE ADDRESS THEIR CRIMINAL CRIMINALLY CRIMINAL JENNY NEEDS AND THERE ARE A RANGE OF THINGS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF POLICE RESPONSES TO TO INCIDENTS CLEARLY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE
FEATURES SUCH AS C. C. T. V. APPROPRIATE STREET LIGHTING AND WE WANT TO HAVE OUR PUBLIC SPACES APPROPRIATELY DESIGNED IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE VISIBLE REASSURANCE POLICING AND A GOOD RESPONSE GOOD DETECTION PROSECUTION WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO HAVE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN POLICE AND SUPPORT SERVICES AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE JOINED UP MULTI AGENCY WORKING
AND OF COURSE THE SENSE OF NEIGHBOURLINESS AND A SENSE OF PLACE AND COMMUNITY ALL OF THOSE THINGS MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO DO BUT BUT YOU THE DETECTION OF CRIME AND REPRODUCING AND PREVENTING THE NEXT VICTIM AT HOW IMPORTANT IS THE SORT OF SURVEILLANCE THAT WE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT SURVEILLANCE OF COURSE IS IMPORTANT BUT IT SIMPLY ONE OF A RANGE OF MATTERS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO WHETHER PEOPLE OFFEND OR WHETHER THEY DON'T
AND FROM A NACRO PERSPECTIVE OF COURSE WHAT WE TRY TO TELL YOU YOU'RE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE CHARITY IT WE ARE AND WE WE REALLY IN IN THE BUSINESS OF REDUCING CRIME AT CHANGING LIVES PREVENTING THE NEXT VICTIM AND SUPPORTING PEOPLE TO REINTEGRATE INTO INTO THE COMMUNITY AND HAVING HAVING CEASED TO A FRIEND AND YOUR VIEW PROFESSOR SHEPHERD IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A DROP IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY BEING INVESTED IN C.C.T.V. AND THE REACTION OF THE POLICE TO IT
YES BUT THE HAVE I THINK THAT WE MUSTN'T FORGET THE CAUSES OF DECREASE THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS AND SAY IN THE FACE OF
FINANCIAL PRESSURES WE WE REALLY MUST CONTINUE TO TO DO THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT WORK AND IF I COMMIT JUST MENTION ONE OTHER DRIVER OF VIOLENCE WE KNOW THAT JUST A SMALL INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF ALCOHOL CAN DECREASE THE NUMBERS OF VICTIMS ACROSS THE INJURED ACROSS WHAT EVIDENCE OF THAT YOU CAN PROVE THAT WHEN YOU SAY A SMALL INCREASE WE WE CERTAINLY HAVE
WE WE WE STUDIED AT A RANGE OF DRIVERS POTENTIAL DRIVERS OF VIOLENCE AND FIND THAT ACTUALLY THE PRICE OF ALCOHOL PARTICULARLY A NON LICENCE PREMISES MAKES A REAL DIFFERENCE BUT YOU SAY SMALL WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SMALL I MEAN LET'S SAY I DON'T KNOW BUT A BOTTLE OF WHISKY IS A FIVER IF YOU PUT A POUND ON IT WOULD IT MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
IT IT WON'T MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO AN INDIVIDUAL BUT MEASURED ACROSS A WHOLE POPULATION MEASURED ACROSS THE WHOLE OF BRITAIN IT'S CERTAINLY THAT THE EVIDENCE IS REALLY STRONG THAT THOSE THAT THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE THE THE THE HE ESCALATOR ON BEER WHICH HAS BEEN FROZEN IT WAS IT WAS FROZEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THAT THAT IT IS
A THINK A NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF CONTROLLING THE BEER SHOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE THE THE THE DUTY ESCALATOR PUT A TWO PERCENT ABOVE INFLATION PRICE RISE ON ARE ON BEER AND THAT WAS BASICALLY THAT CAME TO AN END IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BUDGET SO WE THINK THAT JUST THESE SMALL CHANGES IN POLICY IN THE PRICE OF ALCOHOL IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE
WELL WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THAT ALMOST HALF OF ALL VIOLENT CRIME IS LINKED TO ALCOHOL MISUSE TO BINGE DRINKING LATE NIGHT AND STRING DRINKING SO IF IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLE PURCHASING ALCOHOL AND IF THERE ARE SERVICES THAT SUPPORT PEOPLE IN MOVING AWAY FROM ALCOHOL MISUSE THAT'S GOT TO BE CAMILLA O.K. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED PROFESSORSHIP AT AND DAVID WHAT ARE THEY

THEY MAY THEIR CHILD MAY BE EXPERIENCING DISTRESS ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY AND ALL WE'VE DONE IS PIN EXPLANATORY NOTE THERE TO SAY JUST LEAVE THIS BLANK IF YOU IF THAT'S APPLIES TO YOU BUT THAT'S SORT OF IMPLIED HAVEN'T YOU THAT THEY SHOULD TALK TO THEIR CHILD ABOUT IT I THINK ONE PARENT HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS AND THEY HAVE SAD THAT THAT'S HOW THEY READ THAT STATEMENT IN REASONABLE
I I DIDN'T READ IT THAT WAY MYSELF BUT I THINK WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO FEEDBACK AND WE CONSTANTLY REVIEW FORMS AND IF IF THERE'S ANY AMBIGUITY WITHIN THAT STATEMENT I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY REVIEW IT AND MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR THAT WE
NO WAY EXPECT ANY PARENT WHEN FILLING THAT FORM IN TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEIR CHILD THE PARENTS FOR HIM THAT IS AN ISSUE WILL ALREADY KNOW THAT ALICIA AND ALWAYS SAYING HEIRS IF THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR YOUR FAMILY PLEASE CAN YOU JUST LEAVE THIS BANK AND THIS IS AND WE
WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT YOUR CHILD AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW EDUCATION IS THE IMPORTANT THING AND WE WOULDN'T WANT ANY ANYTHING TO GET IN THE WAY OF THAT CHILD HAVING A GOOD EDUCATION EXPERIENCE BUT BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT EVIDENCE DID YOU BASE THIS ON HOW MUCH I DON'T SWEAR SIMPLY BECAUSE A SPECIFICALLY BUT FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT TOP SOME PEOPLE HAVE
PROBLEMS WITH THEIR WITH THEIR GENDER THERE A TRANS PEOPLE OUT THERE WILL WE WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT THAT THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THIS GENUINE CONCERNS BUT A FOUR YEAR OLD WELL ACTUALLY
THE THING IS WE JUST REVIEW ALL ART FORMS AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSCRIPT YOU WORK WHICH WAS DONE OVER A COURSE OF A YEAR I WAS AWARD WINNING IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE UNDERSTOOD HOW BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FILLED A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY CAN ACCESS ALL COUNCIL SERVICES WITHOUT ANY KIND OF BARRIER TO THAT
SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW OFFICERS HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING IN ADDRESSING EVERY FORM JUST TO GIVE A BIT OF GUIDANCE IF IF IF THEY NEED IT IF SOMEONE NOT QUITE SURE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT EVIDENCE THERE IS THAT A CHILD OF FOUR EVEN UNDERSTANDS WHAT GENDER IS
WELL I THINK ACTUALLY THAT MANY CHILDREN OF HAVE A VERY STRONG IDENTITY AT THE EDGE OF FOUR THAT'S TRYING TO TELL ME THEY THEY SORT OF KNOW THAT WHETHER THEY'RE A BOY OR A GIRL BUT DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT
YOUR CHILDREN AND EVEN THE WORD GYBED IT WAS QUITE INTERESTING COS I SAW THAT THE TELEGRAPH A READING WITH THEIR STORY AND WHEN I WENT BACK OVER THEIR PAPER AND DO GOOD CHANCE KIDS THEY ACTUALLY DID A STORY A FEW A FEW MONTHS OR YEARS BACK EXPLAINING AT CRITICISING ACCOUNTS
THE FACT THAT A CHILD OF FOUR HAD HAD A MISERABLE TIME ALL THE WAY THROUGH PRIMARY SCHOOL HAD BEEN BELATED HAD HAD THAT
FROM DAY ONE AND THE SCHOOL AND THE COUNCIL HASN'T DONE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEM SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE IF IT AFFECTS YOUR FAMILY YOU WERE REALLY CARE THAT WE HAVE LEFT WE HAVE GIVEN YOU SOME GUIDANCE ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF IT DOESN'T AFFECT YOUR FAMILY YOU'RE JUST TICK THE BOX AS USUAL COUNSELLOR THAT THANKS VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME IT'S NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US IN THE STUDIO THE REVEREND DOCTOR GILES FRASER WHO'S PRIEST IN CHARGE OF SAINT MARY NEARING TO GOOD MORNING JOHN MORNING SARAH
ACCORDING TO THE ZADIE RELIGION WHEN THE PEACOCK ANGEL FIRST CAME DOWN TO EARTH HE SPREAD VIBRANCY AND COLOUR FROM HIS FEATHERS TO EVERYTHING THAT HE TOUCHED
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN I WAS IN NORTHERN IRAQ LAST MONTH THE WEATHER WAS ATROCIOUS WITH GREY SKIES AND TORRENTIAL RAIN THE GLORIOUS WORK AT THE PEACOCK ANGEL WAS HARD TO DISCERN IN THE DISMAL REFUGEE CAMPS INTO WHICH THE USE EDIE'S NOW CROWD FOR SHELTER AND PROTECTION
BACK IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ISIS LAUNCHED A MAJOR OFFENSIVE INTO THE TRADITIONAL USE E.D. HEARTLANDS AROUND MOUNT SINGED AND MANY THOUSANDS WERE KILLED OR TAKEN PRISONER
A LOT OF WHAT THEY USE EDIE'S TOLD ME WOULDN'T BE SUITABLE FOR THE RADIO AT THIS TIME OF DAY IN FACT PROBABLY NOT FOR ANY TIME OF DAY I STILL FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCESS HOW ONE HUMAN BEING COULD DO SUCH HORRENDOUS THINGS TO ANOTHER
IN A BROADCAST OF AUGUST NINETEEN FORTY ONE WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID WE ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF A CRIME WITHOUT A NAME THREE YEARS LATER IT WAS GIVEN A NAME GENOCIDE
WHICH THE NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT GENOCIDE CONVENTION WENT ON TO DEFINE AS ACTS COMMITTED WITH INTENT TO DESTROY IN WHOLE OR IN PART AND NATIONAL ETHNIC OR RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS GROUP
LAST MONTH THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A MOTION DESCRIBING ISIS ACTIONS AGAINST THESE D.V.D.S AND CHRISTIANS AS GENOCIDE
LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WILL BE DEBATING SOMETHING SIMILAR
IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THERE WERE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CHRISTIANS IN IRAQ NOW THERE ARE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND MOST OF THEM COMING FROM LONG STANDING COMMUNITIES WHO STILL PRAY IN ARAMAIC THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN BY JESUS HIMSELF
AND IT'S NOT JUST THESE C.D.S AND THE CHRISTIANS THE ICES HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WIPE OUT OF SYRIA AND IRAQ ALSO ALLO WHITES SHIOS MAN D. ENDS SHABBA ACTS
BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON WE SAT DOWN AND WEPT WROTE DISHONEST ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE LAND WE NOW CALL IRAQ AND THAT WAS MY REACTION TOO
SOME SAY OF COURSE THAT RELIGION IS HERSELF THE PROBLEM THAT ISIS THEMSELVES CLAIMED TO BE INSPIRED BY GOD SO OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND WHY THE SECULAR PROFIT TRIES TO IMAGINE NO RELIGION AS AN ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM OF RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT EASY IF YOU TRY
IT'S PRECISELY FAITH THAT GIVES THE USE EDIE'S THERE EX A STENCIL IDENTITY RELIGION BINDS THEM TOGETHER WITH A COLLECTIVE LANGUAGE AND A SET OF COMMON PRACTICES THIS IS WHAT THE TERM GENOCIDE ACKNOWLEDGES AND THIS IS WHAT ISIS WANTS TO DESTROY
YES WHEN RELIGIOUS SOLIDARITY GETS WEAPONISED THROUGH RESENTMENT ALL FEAR WHEN IT GETS PURLOINED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES IT BECOMES HUGELY DANGEROUS
BUT THE HEART OF RELIGION IS SOLIDARITY NOT VIOLENCE WHAT SUMMER ONCE CALLED THE SOLIDARITY OF THE SHAKEN AND THAT I SUSPECT IS PRECISELY WHAT THE USE EDIE'S FIND IN THEIR STORIES OF THE GLORIOUS PEACOCK ANGEL
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH A ROMAN DOCTOR GILES PHASE OF THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT IT'S HARD TO THINK WHAT WOULD PROMPT EIGHT OF BRITAIN'S FORMER CHANCELLORS TO JOIN FORCES AND CAMPAIGN AGAINST SOMETHING IN ANOTHER COUNTRY AND YET EIGHT FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARIES BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE WRITTEN AN ARTICLE IN THE TIMES TODAY ARGUING THAT BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN THE E.U. A LITTLE EARLIER I SPOKE TO ONE OF THEM THE DEMOCRAT LARRY SUMMERS AND I ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN IF BRITAIN VOTED TO LEAVE
WE GOT THE UNFORTUNATE FOR THE BRITISH ECONOMY UNFORTUNATE FREE EUROPE UNFORTUNATE FOR THE UNITED STATES AND UNFORTUNATE FOR THE WORLD
IT WOULD DO DAMAGE TO ONE DOING IT AS A FULLY CENTRE IT WOULD DO DAMAGE TO BRITAIN AS A GATEWAY TO EUROPE
IT WOULD REMOVE THE VERY POSITIVE THE INFLUENCE THERE BRITAIN HAS SWEEPING IN EUROPEAN DEBATE THAT STRENGTHEN THE EUROPEAN OCCUR TO ME THAT WOULD REDUCE
BRITAIN'S VERY POSITIVE INFLUENCE AS OUR WAY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE STRONG PARTICIPANT IN A G. SERVANT AND DEER IN THE G. TWENTY
IT WOULD BE A. STEP AREN'T ANY MORE CLOTHES
OR PROTECTION THERE'S LESS EFFECTIVE THAN LESS PROSPEROUS SQUABBLE WE CALL ME BUT AS FAR AS BRITAIN IS CONCERNED THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT ON LEAVING THAT BRITAIN COULD IMMEDIATELY SIGNAL THAT IT INTENDED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL PLAY WITH CERTAINLY THOSE WHO WANT US TO LEAVE WOULD ARGUE THAT WE COULD FOCUS ON A RELATIONSHIP WITH AMERICA WE COULD INCREASE TRADE WITH AMERICA AND WE COULD STILL BE VERY INVOLVED IN GLOBAL AFFAIR BRITAIN WOULD CONTINUE TO
INVOLVED IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS BUDDY IT'S ROLE WITH AUDI IT'S A KARACHI EUROPE WOULD SURELY BE DIMINISHED I THINK IT WOULD FIND THERE THE REST OF THE WORLD
WHICH SAW IT AS A CRUCIAL GATEWAY TO EUROPE
WOULD SEE IT IS A LESS RELEVANT WHERE SIGNIFICANT CAR EMERY WHERE IT WAS A AT ALL
I BELIEVE THAT THE POUND WOULD VERY LIKELY COMMANDER A VERY SUBSTANTIAL PRESSURE
IN WAYS THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO COULD TRACTION THE BRITISH E. CARA
SO I DO NOT THINK SO THE WORLDS WOULD SPEAK LOUDLY IN THE FACE OF WHAT WOULD BE
PERHAPS THE MOST ISOLATION IS INDEED IN THE LAST CENTURY A FOR BRIT
IT'S HARD TO THINK OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD PROMPT EIGHT FORMER BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY IS TO WRITE A LETTER WOULD IT MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE TO AMERICA IF BRITAIN LEFT I KNOW FROM MY TIME IN GOVERNMENT AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BRITAIN
WAS AN IMPORTANT
FOR THE UNITED STATES
AND THE CANE AND WAS SO IMPORTANT TO US FOR BECAUSE OF COURSE BRITAIN IS ITSELF AN IMPORTANT TO CAR
IT WAS BRITAIN'S PLACE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ITS STRATEGIC LOCATION SO YES I THINK THIS IS IN HIS SHOE
OF SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE ROAD STATE WHAT AN END TO THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP
I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN WOULDN'T CONTINUE TO OF THE CLOSE TIES THAT COMM FROM HISTORY BUT I THINK THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH CRAYON SLATE MUCH LESS
IAN TO PROSPERITY FOR BOTH OUR COUNTRIES AND I THINK THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE MUCH LESS INFLUENCE ON THE BROAD WORLD WATCH WOULD BE LAW
BY THE CLYDE HAVE SPLIT IN THE WEST
THERE ARE BRITISH WITHDRAWAL FROM EUROPE WOULD REPRESENT MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT'S NOT YOUR ROLE TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS BRITISH TO DEBATE IT IS FOR A BRITISH VOTERS
TO MAKE THEIR DECISION WHAT I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT IMAGINE OTHER FORMER SECRETARY SWEET NOT TOO
TO TELL BRITISH VOTERS HOW TO VOTE
WE DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A PERSPECTIVE FROM HER OWN EXPERIENCES IN POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY THERE IS A PROSPECT
SOME MAY WELL WANT TO CONSIDER YOU KNOW THE UNITED STATES AS A COUNTRY
WHERE THEY'RE VERY SHARP PART OF SAINT DIVIDES THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AGREE I
AND SO I THINK IT IS STRIKING IT'S AT LEAST WORTH PONDERING FOR THOSE WHO TAKE HIM
THAT THIS WAS THE QUESTION
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WILL IAN STRONG AGREEMENT
LARRY SUMMERS TALKING TO ME EARLIER WELL I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY THE FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY AND CONSERVATIVE M.P. LIAM FOX WHO WOULD LIKE US TO LEAVE THE E.U. GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND THAT IS WHAT IS STRIKING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THERE ARE EIGHT OF THESE FORMER U.S. TREASURY SET SECRETARIES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL DIVIDE AND AMERICA MAKING THE EFFORT TO DO THIS AND SAYING DON'T DO IT WELL I ACTUALLY I RESPECT THERE THERE ARE SOME OF THEM TO GO BACK A LONG WAY AND I THINK THERE ARE THREE MISTAKES IN THE ANALYSIS THE FIRST IS THAT
BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS SOMEHOW AN ISOLATIONIST MOVE IN FACT MANY OF US SEE IT OR SETTING OURSELVES FREE FROM THE SCLEROTIC INWARD LOOKING EUROPE
AND MORE ABLE TO BE ACTIVE IN THE EMERGING GLOBALISED ERA OF THE SECOND IS THIS IDEA THAT WE HAVE A VERY POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY WHEN WE NOW HAVE THE PAYMENT MAJORITY IN THE EUROZONE WHO CAN OUT VOTERS AND DO LIKE VOTERS AND ECONOMIC ISSUES BUT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT FAILURE OF THE ANALYSIS
IS THAT THERE I THINK OR FEEL TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DECLINE AND FAILURE OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY ITSELF WITH A FOLDING SHARE OF WORLD TRADE A SMALLER AND LESS IMPORTANT DESTINATION FOR U.K. EXPORTS AND WITH CHRONIC UNEMPLOYMENT IF YOU LOOK AT BRITAIN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF FIVE POINT ONE PER CENT THE EUROPEAN UNION'S
AVERAGES EIGHT POINT NINE PER CENT AND THE EUROZONE IS TEN POINT THREE PER CENT THAT IS FEELING EUROPEAN ECONOMY WE'RE CLEARLY NOT HAVING THE INFLUENCE THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE OR THEY WOULD BE HAVING FALLING UNEMPLOYMENT WAY THAT WE HAVE IN BRITAIN OH KAY LET'S TAKE THE POINT ABOUT YOU SAY LOOK WE COULD BE MORE ACTIVE BUT THE ARGUMENT REALLY IS WELL YOU CAN BE BUT NO ONE'S GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE LESS RELEVANT LESS SIGNIFICANT ON YOU IT WAS GET UP LEAVE THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY OTHER AREAS THAN JUST MONEY WHERE BRITAIN MATTERS
SECURITY BEING ONE OF THEM WE HAVE THE WORLD'S FIFTH BIGGEST DEFENCE BUDGET WE ANCHORED IN NATO AND ANOTHER DIFFERENCE I WOULD HAVE WITH THE ANALYSIS IS THAT THE AGA IN THE BRITAIN'S ANCHOR IN EUROPE IS ECONOMIC I THINK BRITAIN'S AT ANCHOR IN EUROPE IS STRATEGIC AND THAT'S LARGELY THROUGH NATAL WHERE HER EUROPEAN ALLIES ARE ACTUALLY FEELING TO MAKE
THE CUT IN TERMS OF THE CONTRIBUTION THEY MAKE TO THAT'S LIKE A SECURITY INCLUDING UNITED STATES THIS SUGGESTION THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC THEY MAKE A VERY POWERFUL ECONOMIC ARGUMENT THEY DO MAKE OTHERS PART OF WHICH IS THE EFFECT ON THE E. U. IF BRITAIN LEFT NOW YOU MIGHT SAY LOOK THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT
PROBLEM BUT IT WOULD BE IF OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR CHANGED AS A RESULT OF US LEAVE IT WELL I WOULD BUT WOULD CHANGE AS A RESULT IT WAS LEAVING AND I HOPE IT WOULD CHANGE FOR THE BETTER THE PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT IS THAT YOU'VE GOT THE OLD MEN OF BRUSSELS WHO FOLLOWING A ROAD MAP SET IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND REFUSING TO CHANGE
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ALL OF EUROPE YOU'VE GOT A GENERATION OF YOUNG EUROPEANS SACRIFICED ON THE ALTAR OF THE SINGLE CURRENCY LITTLE HOPE OF PROSPERITY ECONOMICALLY IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES COS IF THE EFFECT WAS TO BOOST THE SORT OF ANTI E.U. POPULIST MOVEMENTS THE MARINE LE PEN STEER THOSE PERHAPS MORE STRIDENT VOICES IN THE E.U. THE WEEK TALKING ABOUT BUT THE WAY TO STOP THAT IS FOR THE EUROPEAN YOU NEED TO CHANGE DIRECTION AND TO LISTEN TO THE GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACROSS EUROPE AND UNHAPPY
WITH THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL YOU CANNOT SIMPLY HAVE A WHOLE GENERATION OF YOUNG EUROPEANS DISLOCATED FROM ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND EXPECT THERE TO BE NO SOCIAL OR POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE LESS THERE WAS FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THAT EUROPEAN LEADERSHIP WE WILL HAVE A UNEMPLOYED INCONTINENT I THINK BRITISH EXIT MAY GIVE THEM THE SHOCK THERAPY THE ACTUALLY REQUIRE TO MAKE THE CHANGE NECESSARY TO STOP YOU FALLING APART THEN FOX THANK YOU VERY MUCH
QUICK WEATHER FORECAST AND THE SUN CONTINUES TO BE TAT BEAT DOWN ON US IT'S BEAUTIFUL ACROSS MOST OF THE U.K. THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD AT THE MO IN THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S SUNSHINE ALL ROUND WALL TO WALL SUNSHINE
TEMPERATURES TODAY SHOULD PEAK AT AROUND EIGHTEEN DEGREES POSSIBLY IN THE SOUTH WEST MIDLANDS PERHAPS THE SOUTH OF WALES MOST OF US AROUND FIFTEEN AND A LITTLE BIT COOLER IN GLASGOW EDINBURGH AND BELFAST HE TEMPERATURES GETTING UP TO AROUND THIRTEEN DEGREES LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON THE WINDS ARE GOING TO BE PARTICULARLY GUSTY IN CORNWALL AND DEVON SO IT MIGHT BE SUNNY MIGHT BE LOVELY OUT THERE THE WINDS WILL BE VERY STRONG PERHAPS TOUCHING GALE FORCE THIS EVENING
QUICK ON TO TONIGHT'S QUICKLY ON TONIGHT THREE DEGREES WILL BE OVERNIGHT LOW FOR MOST OF US A BIT MILDER ON THE SOUTH COAST AND THEN TOMORROW IT WON'T BE QUITE AS SUNNIEST TODAY I THINK THERE'S EVEN A CHANCE OF A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN IN THE FAR SOUTH WEST OF OF ENGLAND THAT'S ABOUT IT THANKS TOM LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THE REMARKABLE STORY OF THE BRITISH SPY BASED IN BERLIN WHO SAVED THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF JEWS AND THE DISTURBING STORY OF THEIR NINE YEAR OLD BOY WHO CAN SEE NO POINT IN CONTINUING TO LIVE
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ARE MADE HERE FORWARD JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE TWENTIETH APRIL THE HEADLINES PRINCE WILLIAM HAS RESPONDED TO CRITICISMS THAT HE'S WORK SHY SAYING HE TAKES HIS ROYAL RESPONSIBILITIES VERY SERIOUSLY EIGHT FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARIES HAVE WADED INTO THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE TELLING BRITISH VOTERS HER DECISION TO LEAVE WOULD BE A RISKY BET
DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE SCORED BIG WINS IN THE LATEST PRIMARY CONTESTS BOLSTERING THEIR BIDS TO SECURE THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT NOMINATIONS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND ONE MILLION PEOPLE WHO WORK IN CITY CENTRES AND CROWDED PLACES HAD TO BE TRAINED IN HOW TO RESPOND TO TERROR ATTACKS
THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CAROLINE NICHOLS PRINCE WILLIAM HAS ATTEMPTED TO SHRUG OFF CRITICISM OF HIS COMMITMENT HIS ROYAL DUTIES SO HE'S CURRENTLY CONCENTRATING ON HIS ROLE AS A FATHER AND HIS JOB AS AN AIR AMBULANCE PILOT BUT HE'S ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO TAKE ON MORE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THE TIME COMES
THE B. B. C. INTERVIEW THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE ALSO DESCRIBED THE INCREDIBLE INSIGHTS HE'D GAINED FROM OBSERVING THE QUEEN HIS NINETIETH BIRTHDAY IT IS TOMORROW HE SPOKE TO OUR ROYAL CORRESPONDENT NICHOLAS WITCHELL
THE QUEEN SENSE OF DUTY HER SERVICE HER COMMITMENT TO OTHERS HAD ALL BEEN IN WILLIAM'S WORDS ARE GUIDING EXAMPLE OF WHAT A GOOD MONARCH SHOULD BE HIS OWN COMMITMENT TO ROYAL DUTY HAS BEEN QUESTIONED IN SOME QUARTERS IN RECENT MONTHS THERE HAVE BEEN HEADLINES IN SOME NEWSPAPERS WHICH HAVE REFER TO HIM AS WORKSHY WILLIAM THEY WERE CRITICISMS WHICH HE SAID HE DIDN'T IGNORE BUT WHICH HE DIDN'T TAKE COMPLETELY TO HEART
I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY I TAKE MY RESPONSIBILITIES VERY SERIOUSLY
BUT IT'S IT'S ABOUT FINDING YOUR OWN WAY AT THE RIGHT TIME AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL DUTY CAN THAT'S A WEIGH YOU DOWN FOR A LOT
AT A VERY EARLY AGE I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO DEVELOP INTO THE DUTY ROLL WILLIAM EMPHASISED THE IMPORTANCE HE ATTACHED TO HIS ROLE AS AN AIR AMBULANCE PILOT AND AT THE TIME HE SPENDS WITH HIS FAMILY HE SAID THAT BOTH HIS FATHER AND HIS GRANDMOTHER SUPPORTED THE FACT THAT HE'S NOT YET FULLY ENGAGED WITH ROYAL DUTIES BUT THAT WHEN THE TIME CAME TO ACCEPT MORE RESPONSIBILITIES HE WOULD BE THE FIRST PERSON HE SAID TO PUT UP HIS HAND AND TAKE THEM ON
EIGHT FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARIES HAVE WARNED BRITISH VOTERS THAT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS A RISKY BET WRITING IN THE TIMES THE MEN WHO'VE RUN AMERICAN FINANCES GOING BACK AS FAR AS PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON SO THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES HAS BENEFITED FROM HAVING A STRONG BRITAIN WITHIN EUROPE THEY MADE THEIR INTERVENTION AHEAD OF A VISIT TO LONDON BY PRESIDENT OBAMA LATER THIS WEEK AS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH REPORTS
THE WARNING FROM THE MEN WHO USED TO RUN THE U.S. ECONOMY UNDER SUCCESSIVE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT LEADERS IS STARK LONDON'S ROLE AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL CENTRE WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY TRADE WOULD BE REDUCED INVESTMENT DETERRED NEW TRADE DEALS DIFFICULT TO REACH A POUND WOULD COME UNDER PRESSURE
AND BRITAIN WOULD RISK BECOMING A SMALLER SLOWER GROWING ECONOMY FOR YEARS TO COME THEY ALSO WARN OF BRITAIN'S DIMINISHED INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD AND SAY IT WOULD BE A STEP TOWARDS A MORE ISOLATIONIST AND PROTECTIONIST BRITAIN SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME LARRY SUMMERS WHO WORKED UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON SAID IT ALSO RISKED WEAKENING THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES I THINK THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WOULD CRAYON SLATE MUCH WEAR
IAN TO PROSPERITY FOR BOTH OUR COUNTRIES AND I THINK THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE MUCH LESS INFLUENCE ON THE BROAD WORLD WATCH WOULD BE LAW
BY THE CLYDE HAVE SPLIT IN THE WHERE
THERE ARE BRITISH WITHDRAWAL FROM EUROPE WOULD REPRESENT DOWNING STREET HAVE DENIED COORDINATING TODAY'S LETTER BUT HAVE HAILED IT AS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS THE MASSIVE THIRD PARTIES SUPPORT FOR REMAINING IN THE E.U. AND PUT IT ALONGSIDE BACKING FROM THE LIKES OF THE I.M.F. AND THE EXPECTED SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA LATER THIS WEEK AND NUMBER TEN SOURCE SAID THE LACK OF SUCH SUPPORT FOR THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WAS BECOMING EMBARRASSING
LEAVE SUPPORTERS HOWEVER HAVE ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF SOLICITING HELP FROM ACROSS THE POND TO BELITTLE BRITAIN'S PLACE IN THE WORLD
DONALD TRUMP HAS WON A BIG VICTORY IN NEW YORK IN THE LATEST ROUND OF VOTING IN THE RACE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS HE WAS WELL AHEAD OF HIS NEAREST REPUBLICAN RIVALS FOR THE DEMOCRATS HILLARY CLINTON ALSO CLAIMED A SIGNIFICANT VICTORY OVER BERNIE SANDERS OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT WATCHED THE RESULTS COME IN
DONALD TRUMP ENTERED HIS VICTORY RALLY WITH BIG APPLE SWAGGER FRANK SINATRA'S FAMOUS ANTHEM BLARING FROM THE SPEAKERS
IT'S THE SCALE OF THE VICTORY THAT MAKES IT SO SIGNIFICANT IT GIVES HIM A BIG DELEGATE HALL AND TAKES HIM CLOSER TO SECURING THE NUMBER HE NEEDS TO WIN THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A RACE ANY MORE SENATOR CRUISER'S JUST
AFTER A STRING OF DEFEATS HILLARY CLINTON REINFORCED TO FRONT RUNNER STATUS IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOW FOR BERNIE SANDERS TO OVERHAUL HER LEAD THE RACE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IS IN THE HOME
THE FORMER NEW YORK SENATOR CAN ALMOST LAY CLAIM TO BEING HER PARTY'S PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE BUT DONALD TRUMP CAN'T YET MAKE THAT BOAST THOUGH HE CAME IN THIRD THE TEXAN SENATOR TED CRUISES HOPING STILL TO PREVENT THE BILLIONAIRE FROM REACHING THE DELEGATE TOTALLY NEEDS FOR AN OUTRIGHT VICTORY AND TO PRODUCE WHAT'S CALLED A CONTESTED CONVENTION IN JULY
A SENIOR DIRECTORATE TATA STEEL IS FORMING A MANAGEMENT BUY OUT TEAM TO START THE PROCESS OF BIDDING TO TAKE OVER THE COMPANY'S U.K. OPERATION WHICH EMPLOYS FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IT'S BELIEVED THE DEAL BEING PUT TOGETHER BY STUART WILKIE WOULD INVOLVE STEELMAKING CONTINUING AT PORT TALBOT DESPITE ITS HUGE LOSSES MANAGERS WOULD ASK EMPLOYEES TO HELP FINANCE THE NEW COMPANY WITH THEIR OWN MONEY AS WELL AS SEEKING LARGER PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC MONEY
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE TAXPAYERS' MONEY IS GOING IN HUMANITARIAN CRISES THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS THE DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT KNOWN AS DATED THEY PROVE THE OVERSIGHT OF U.N. AGENCIES WHICH IT SAYS OFTEN ENGAGED IN THEIR OWN TURF WARS HE'S A GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT NAOMI GRIMLY
PEACE ON THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN SCRUTINISING THE PART OF DEFENCE BUDGET SPENT ON HUMANITARIAN CRISES WHEN THE BATS COMBATING A BOWLER OR HELPING SYRIAN REFUGEES LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SPENT MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS ON SUCH ASSISTANCE AND HALF OF THAT WENT TO U.N. AGENCIES WORKING ON THE GROUND
THE M.P.S ARE WORRIED THAT THESE U.N. BODIES DON'T NECESSARILY FEEDBACK DATA ON HOW THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY THEY ARE GIVEN THIS IN TURN MAKES IT HARD FOR DEFEAT TO TRACK THE VALUE FOR MONEY IT'S GETTING ON BEHALF OF BRITISH TAXPAYERS
JAPAN'S MITSUBISHI CAR COMPANY IS TO HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE IN AN HOUR'S TIME SHARES IN THE COMPANY HAVE FALLEN MORE THAN FIFTEEN PER CENT THIS MORNING AMID REPORTS THAT HAD CONDUCTED IMPROPER OMISSIONS TESTS
ONE MILLION STAFF WHO WORK IN CROWDED PLACES IN BRITAIN TO BE BRIEFED FROM TODAY ON HOW TO COPE DURING A TERROR ATTACK THE INITIATIVE FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF'S COUNCIL WILL BUILD ON AN EXISTING SCHEME THAT ALREADY SEES ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE GIVEN ADVICE EVERY YEAR IS OUR SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FRANK GARDNER
HOW TO PREPARE FOR AN ATROCITY AS A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN TROUBLING THE POLICE AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES EVER SINCE THE MARAUDING TERRORIST ATTACKS IN MUMBAI IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN QUIETLY BRIEFING STAFF WHO WORK IN CROWDED PUBLIC PLACES AND WHAT TO DO IF A SIMILAR ATTACK OCCURRED HERE
BUT NOW IN THE WAKE OF THE RECENT PARIS AND BRUSSELS ATTACKS EFFORTS TO PREPARE WORKERS IN CITY CENTRES AND SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT VENUES ARE TO BE MASSIVELY STEPPED UP
FROM TODAY PROJECT GRIFFIN AS IT'S KNOWN WILL BE EXPANDED TO BRIEF A MILLION STAFF THERE FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS
THE MOVE COMES AMID AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TRAIN POLICE FIREARMS OFFICERS TO COPE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF CRIMINALS INSPIRED BY THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE COULD OPEN FAR IN A PUBLIC PLACE USING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS SMUGGLED IN FROM MAINLAND EUROPE
A SURVEY HAS SUGGESTED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND WALES REQUIRING HOSPITAL TREATMENT AFTER BEING ASSAULTED LEVELLED OFF LAST YEAR AFTER A SERIES OF ANNUAL FALLS RESEARCHERS AT CARDIFF UNIVERSITY SET COULD SIGNAL THE END OF A LONG TERM TREND OF DECLINING LEVELS OF VIOLENCE HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
LAST YEAR AN ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ATTENDED EMERGENCY HOSPITAL DEPARTMENTS FOR INJURIES AS A RESULT OF VIOLENCE ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY IT WAS THE FIRST YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AFTER SUCCESSIVE ANNUAL FOOLS THAT THERE WAS NO REAL CHANGE IN THE FIGURES RESEARCHERS SAY IT RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE LONG STEADY DECLINE IN VIOLENCE IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS COME TO AN END
THEY SAY ONE POSSIBLE REASON IS THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND POLICE ARE SPENDING LESS MONEY ON MONITORING IN REAL TIME FOOTAGE FROM C.C.T.V. CAMERAS WHICH IS THOUGHT CAN HELP PREVENT VIOLENT INCIDENTS FROM ESCALATING
A BREAKDOWN OF THE FIGURES INDICATES THAT SLIGHTLY MORE GIRLS AND WOMEN WERE ASSAULTED LAST YEAR THAN IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS AND THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT RISE OF EIGHT PER CENT IN VIOLENCE AFFECTING PEOPLE AGED OVER FIFTY
RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT PARTICIPATING IN AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES HELPS CHILDREN FROM POORER BACKGROUNDS AND ENGLAND ACHIEVE HIGHER MARKS IN ACADEMIC LESSONS THE STUDY BY THE INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION FOUND THE GUP IN TEST PERFORMANCE BETWEEN POORER AND BETTER OFF CHILDREN WAS NEARLY HALVED IN THOSE THAT TOOK PART IN TWO SUCH CLUBS ARE WEAK
IT IS NOW TEN PAST EIGHT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE'S SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION WE TEND TO ASSOCIATE IT WITH TEENAGERS AND IT'S TRUE THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED IS WORRYINGLY HIGH ALMOST EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND OF THEM IN THIS COUNTRY WE REPORTED LAST WEEK THAT MANY OF THEM ARE NOT GETTING ACCESS TO THE CARE THEY NEED AND THAT INCLUDES CHILDREN NOT YET IN THEIR TEENS CHILDREN WITH NO SELF WORTH CHILDREN WHO DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANY LONGER
OUR REPORTER SEAM LOOK AT HATCHET HAS BEEN TO MEET NINE YEAR OLD PAUL HE HAS HIGH FUNCTIONING AUTISM AND HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS VERY DEPRESSED HE WAS WITH HIS MOTHER CLAIRE WHO'S BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR MORE HELP FOR CHILDREN WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS
THERE'S A LETTER THERE WHY DO YOU WRITE THAT LETTER MUM AND DAD WERE GOING TO A MEETING WITH NORMAN LAMB AND IT WAS HOME WITH A TON OF REALLY IMPORTANT PEOPLE
YOUR MEDICAL STUFF SO IVORY TEAR BOOK IT IS INDEED BETTER THAN COMING SO YOUR PARENTS CAN BEST TELL COMING FROM THE CHILD CINCHED IT READ IT DO YOU MIND
HELLO MY NAME'S MIZ POOLE RIGHT AND THIS IS A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ME
WHEN I WAKE UP THIS IS HORRIBLE FEELING DOWN INSIDE ME BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS I NORMALLY SAY TO MYSELF YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING I KNOW MEAL SHE SAY IS IT WORTH IT I COULD JUST KILL MYSELF I WOULDN'T HAVE TO FACE
MY GOING TO STEEP IS HORRIBLE I THINK IT WILL THIS MUST FEEL LIKE I NORMALLY FALL ASLEEP AT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK SO NOW JUST NOT LOOKING AT THE LETTER WHAT IS LIFE LIKE FOR YOU
IT'S REALLY REALLY TOUGH COS YOU JUST FEEL REALLY MISERABLE AND DEPRESSED WHEN YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING JUST YOU KNOW ONE END OF THE PRYING TRYING TO DO ANOTHER DAY
YOU JUST GOING BE MISERABLE MISERABLE THE NEXT DAY I JUST DON'T WANNA GELL OF BIRD THEIR SCRIBE MOST DAYS AND RECENTLY I'VE JUST BEEN REALLY STILL LIKE I JUST HATE LEAVING THE HOUSE THESE DAYS
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'RE MISERABLE BECAUSE HE'S JUST GET SO DEPRESSED DIDN'T FEEL SO LONELY AND I DO KNOW THERE'S A KID ADULTS HELP THEY'RE LIKE THAT FEEL LIKE IT BUT YOU JUST STILL FEEL SO LONELY
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT GETS TOO MUCH BUT I JUST LIKE PUNKS DON'T HAVE TO KEEP IT IN FOR MONDAY I JUST CANNOT SLEEP IT INTO EVERYTHING TO THE TOILETS AND JUST STARTED BUCKING AND THUMPING KICKING EVERYTHING
WHAT KIND OF HELP ARE YOU GETTING WELL I GAVE TO TWO THINGS
I GO TO A PLACE CALLED QUEEN ONE AND NOW THE CALL OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY DOES THAT HELP I THINK SO NOMINAL OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY EARLY DO YOU LOTS OF PHYSICAL STUFF ACTUALLY
CLIMB AROUND STUFF BUT WE WON AND NORMALLY TALK ABOUT HOW I FEEL AND HOW I COULD KEEP CALM DESCRIBE WHAT IT'S LIKE IT'S EXCESS SOME PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS YEAH WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM I MEAN THE SIEVE SOMEONE A TUBE YOU'RE ONLY NINE HOW CAN YOU BE FEELING LIKE THIS
YOU CAN'T JUST A SHAME BECAUSE ANYONE CAN FEEL YOU KNOW ANYTHING
HOW WAS SCHOOL THIS MORNING GOOD IT WAS A LITTLE BIT STRESSFUL WHAT WAS STRESSFUL FROM THE QUESTIONS A MATTER REALLY
AS A MOTHER HOW DO YOU COPE WITH YOUR SON FEELING LIKE THIS ON A DAILY BASIS
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE AT NINE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE HIM A CUDDLE AND TELL HIM HE'LL BE O.K. AND TALK THROUGH WHAT'S UPSET HIM AND I CAN'T I CAN'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER I CAN'T CHANGE IT AND I CAN'T HELP HIM SEE THE WORLD THROUGH MY EYES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY HE SEES HIMSELF ON THE WORLD
JUST GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU DEAL WITH EVERY DAY HE SAYS THAT HE FEELS WORTHLESS BUT HE CONTRIBUTES NOTHING TO THE WORLD AROUND HIM AND HE SAYS THAT HE WOULD BE BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF HE JUST DIDN'T WAKE UP TOMORROW IF HE WAS DEAD WE WOULD ALL BE BETTER OFF AND THAT'S GONE FROM SAYING IS IT DOESN'T WANNA WAKE UP TO THINKING ABOUT HOW HE COULD KILL HIMSELF AND HOW HE COULD MAKE SURE THAT HE DIES AND THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH TOMORROW I MEAN HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL
IT'S BEYOND AWFUL YOU HAVE TO JUST MAKE SURE HE KNOWS THAT WE LOVE HIM AND TELL HIM THAT WE UNDERSTAND OUR HARD IT MUST BE FOR HIM AND TRY AND HELP HIM IN THERE EASIER MOMENTS TO SEE THE GOOD TO SEE THAT HAPPINESS TO SEE THE POINT
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE A THINK ABOUT THREE BIG QUESTIONS LIKE MORE FOR SOMETIMES YOU JUST DON'T GET WHY YOU LIKE PEOPLE TREAT EACH OTHER HORRIBLY LATE WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE WALL AND YOU KNOW WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE TO BE HOMELESS AND THINGS LIKE WHY DO YOU TREAT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY JUST COS OF THE COLOUR OF THEIR SKIN ANGLER QUITE ANGRY
I DON'T KNOW REALLY IT'S JUST REALLY UNFAIR
THAT WAS PAUL NINE YEARS OLD TALKING TO SEEM A CADETSHIP AT I'M JOINED BY PROFESSOR EMILE SIMON OFF WHO'S THE HEAD OF CHILD IN ADOLESCENCE OR TREE AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT
WELL IT'S REALLY VERY DISTRESSING TO HEAR ISN'T IT HER NINE YEAR OLD BOY WHO FEELS LIKE HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET UP IN THE MORNING CAT FACE A DAY DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL I THINK IT MUST MAKE ARM EVERYONE ESPECIALLY OR PARENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED AND DISTRESS AT SUCH A YOUNG CHILD COULD BE FEELING THAT WAY AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND THE CHILD WHO SHARES AND MOST PARENTS HAVE HAD THEIR CHILDREN SAY TO THEM AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN OR WHATEVER IT IS ALL BEING THOROUGHLY
DEPRESSED STATE FOR A DAY OR A COUPLE OF DAYS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE A PNEUMO PICK ME UP ON THE WORD NORMAL WAY THE KIDS BEHAVE YEAH SO
ALL CHILDREN HAVE TIMES WHEN THEY FEEL VERY UPSET AND DISTRESSED WHEN THEY CRY AND MAY FOR EVEN THOUGH
FEW MINUTES FEEL THEY'RE THE OTHER CAB IMAGINE HOW THEIR LIFE IS GOING TO BE THE SAME THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT ARM SHOULD LEAD ONE PARTICULARLY TO BE CONCERNED AND I SHOULD SAY FOR MOST PARENTS IT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT DISTINCTION IS MY CHILD JUST EXPERIENCING THE TURBULENCE OF EVERY DAY LIFE WAS OR SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS WRONG HERE SO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT I'M A PARENT SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR
ARE A PERSISTENT LOW MOOD A MOOD THAT CONTINUES TO BE WHERE THE CHILD'S MISERABLE BABY CRYING DOESN'T ENJOY USUAL DAILY ACTIVITIES OVER MORE THAN APPEAR OVER OVER MORE THAN DES YOU'RE A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WOULD LEAD IN THE CHILLI THE PARENT TO BE CONCERNED AT ANY PARTICULAR AGE
IT CAN HAPPEN AT ANY AGE BEING DEPRESSED IS MORE COMMON IN ADOLESCENCE AND TEENAGERS SO WE WOULD SEE A BELT MAYBE ONE AND A HUNDRED ONE IN FIFTY TEENAGERS EXPERIENCE IN SIGNIFICANT DEPRESSION IT IS LESS COMMON IN YOUNGER CHILDREN SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE REGION OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED ARMED CHILL ONE OF LIGHT AS WELL IT IS IT IS MUCH MORE COMMON THAN MANY PEOPLE THINK AH
BUT IT DOES INCREASE WITH IN THEIR TEENAGE YEARS AND DOESN'T JUST GO AWAY IT DOESN'T JUST GO AWAY WELL IT'S GOT TO THAT STAGE WHERE IT'S PERSISTENT AND PARENTS CAN CHIVVY THEIR CHILD OUT OF THAT BY SAYING DOES THAT OUR INSTINCT ISN'T IT TO TRY AND CHEER UP COME ON YES AND THAT'S QUITE THE RIGHT THING FOR PARENTS TO DO ARM AND FOR MANY CHILDREN WHO AREN'T TOLD DON'T HAVE A CLINICAL CONDITION OF DEPRESSION THEY WILL
CHEER UP WHEN THEY GO TO THE CINEMA GO TO A FOOTBALL MATCH WHATEVER IT IS THEY ENJOY DOING AND THEY'LL GET OVER THE EVENTS THAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THEM TO HAVE A LOW MOOD BUT FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE A CLINICAL STATE OF DEPRESSION WE CAN'T ASSUME IT WILL JUST GO AWAY AND IT'S REALLY VERY ESSENTIAL THAT THEY GO ON PROPER EVIDENCE BASED MENTAL HEALTH
INTERVENTION BY THAT YOU DON'T MEAN THE SORT OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY THAT THAT LITTLE BOY WAS GUTTED OF COURSE I CAN'T JUDGE WHAT IN FACT PAUL IS GETTING FROM HIS OWN DESCRIPTION BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT WE DO HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE OF WHAT INTERVENTIONS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION AND THE TYPICAL ARM INTERVENTIONS TO START WITH WOULD BE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OR TALKING THERAPIES PER TAKE ON COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY
AND IS THERE ARE THERE ENOUGH PEOPLE EXPERT THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH HER PRESENT ONE OF THE FIRST SORT OF PERHAPS
SOMEONE HIDDEN FOWKES IS THAT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS CHILD MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY CUT IN SOME AREAS UP TO THIRTY OR FORTY PERCENT BECAUSE FUNDING COMES NOT JUST FROM THE HEALTH SERVICE BUT FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES SO THAT STREAMER FUNDING HAS LED TO QUITE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE DO HOPE WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT FUNDING WHICH WE HAVE YET TO SEE
IN FULL THAT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WHO NEED AND JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS IF A CHILD AS YOUNG AS NINE OR PERHAPS EVEN YOUNGER YOU WERE SAYING DOES NOT GET TREATMENT JUST THEN DAMAGE THAT CHILD FOR LIFE OR WILL THEY EVENTUALLY GROW OUT OF IT I'M WELL
OBVIOUSLY IT WENT CAB OR GIVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER BUT ONE SHOULD NOT AS SEEING THEIR CHILDREN OR INDEED ANYONE GROWS HAVE DEPRESSION IT'S AN UP AND DOWN ILLNESS BUT IMPORTANTLY CHILDREN CAN MISS OUT ON IMPORTANT STAGES AND DEVELOPMENT ARE THAT EVEN IF THEY
EVEN IF DEPRESSION GETS BETTER THEY COULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON EDUCATION FRIENDSHIPS AND IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT DEPRESSION WILL PERSIST AND WORLD RECUR AND WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR ARM FUNCTIONING THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFESPAN SO PROPER TREATMENT ESSENTIAL ABSOLUTELY PROFESSOR SIMON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT TANK IT WAS NEW YORK'S TURN TO PICK WHO IT WANTED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT WHO DID THEY GO FOR PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY THE DEMOCRATS PLUMP FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND THE REPUBLICANS DONALD TRUMP BUT THE WAY THEY WON WAS SIGNIFICANT IN HIS VICTORY SPEECH AT TRUMP TOWER IN THE CITY MISTER TRUMP SAID SENATOR CREWS HAD BEEN MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED FROM THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION HE SAID THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK HAD GIVEN HIM A DECISIVE VICTORY
I WANNA JUST THANK EVERYBODY I HAVE GREAT GREAT ADMIRATION HAD PRAISE FOR THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK
I CAN'T THINK OF NOWHERE THAT I WOULD RATHER HAVE THIS VICTORY AND FOR HILLARY CLINTON A FORMER SENATOR IN THE CITY SHE TWO CELEBRATED A BIG WIN
ALWAYS YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD MY
ALWAYS TRY YOUR
GATHER WE DON'T
DO YOU PLAY DO YOU WE'RE GRATEFUL
WELL JIM KNOCKED DAY IS HERE AND JIM ARE BIG WINS FOR BOTH BIG ENOUGH TO MEAN THAT'S IT PROBABLY BUT NOT CERTAINLY SET A DONALD TRUMP WASN'T SPEAKING THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAID IT WAS MATHEMATICALLY OVER
ONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE SAID THAT HE WON SIXTY PER CENT OF THE VOTE TED CRUISE LYING CRUISE AS HE CALLS HIM IN ALL THIS SOCIAL MEDIA TO EAT AND SO ON I GOT LESS THAN FIFTEEN PER JOHN CASE AT TWENTY FIVE SO IT'S A HUGE WIN FOR TRUMP HE GETS MOST OF THE DELEGATES ALL BUT THREE OF THE DELEGATES FROM YORK CLUTCH OF EAST COAST IT'S COMING UP NEXT WEEK WHICH WILL BRING HIM
QUITE CLOSE TO THE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DELEGATES HE NEEDS TO WIN ON THE FIRST BALLOT AT THE CONVENTION BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE HIM OVER THE LINE MITCH MCCONNELL THE LEADER OF THE SENATE PROBABLY THE MOST POWERFUL REPUBLIC IN THE COUNTRY STILL HOPING ALTHOUGH HE CAN'T BEAR TED CRUISE BUT HE'S IN A POSITION OF WANTING HIM TO BE DONALD TRUMP SAID THE OTHER DAY AND I QUOTE AN INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC HE WAS INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THERE WILL BE A SECOND BALLOT WHERE DELEGATES ARE ALLOWED TO SIXTY PER CENT OF THEM AFTER THE FIRST BALLOT CAN DO WHAT THEY LIKE ON THE SECOND
LOOSENS UP EVEN MORE AND THE THIRD BUT DONALD TRUMP IS GETTING QUITE CLOSE AS FAR AS THE DEMOCRATIC RACES CONCERNED HILLARY CLINTON FIFTY EIGHT FORTY ONE OF HER BERNIE SANDERS HE'S ALMOST THERE I THINK IT'LL BE TECHNICALLY
UNLIKE THE TRUMP THING IT WILL BE MATHEMATICALLY WRAPPED UP BEFORE THE END OF APRIL OH KAY IF TRUMP GETS THEIR NOMINATION HOW WILL HE TAKE HER ON WELL THIS IS THE VERY INTERESTING THING THE REASON THAT PEOPLE LIKE MITCH MCCONNELL AND OF COURSE TED CREW SENATOR CREWSON TEXAS A SO
ILL DISPOSED TO DONALD TRUMP AND THEY CALL THEM ALL THE THINGS UNDER THE SUN IS THAT FIRST OF ALL THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S IN MY LOGICAL IDEOLOGICAL CONSERVATIVE WHICH IS TRUE AND SECONDLY THEY BELIEVE THAT HE WILL SAY ANYTHING TO GET ELECTED HE'S A CHAMELEON NOW I'VE NO COMMENT ON THAT BUT THE EVIDENCE IS FAIRLY STRONG NOW THE QUESTION THAT HE POSES A REALLY INTERESTING ONE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE AUTUMN OF TRUMP IS THE NOMINEE THERE WILL BE A FRACTIOUS CONVENTION IT IS GOING TO BE A MESS IN CLEVELAND THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT IF HE EMERGES HE'S GOING TO TAKE
LET ME PUT IT LIKE THIS A LEAF OUT OF BERNIE SANDERS THIS BOOK IN TAKING ON HILLARY CLINTON SANDERS HAS MOBILISED THIS LIBERAL ARMY AND HE'S EXPOSED HILLARY CLINTON'S WEAK SUIT THEIR BACKGROUND THEIR MONEY
BILL ALL THE REST OF IT NOW DONALD TRUMP WILL BE LEARNING THAT AS WE GO AND IF TRUMP BECOMES THE NOMINEE WATCH IN SEPTEMBER HE WILL NOT BE RUNNING ON A SORT OF WILD RIGHT WING TICKET HE'LL BECOME
A LIGHTNING ROD FOR DISAFFECTED DEMOCRATS AS WELL IT WILL BE A DIFFERENT DONALD TRUMP NOW THE MANY REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON WHO THINK THAT IF HE IS THE CANDIDATE IT WILL BE A CATASTROPHE FOR THE PARTY HE CAN'T WIN HE WILL LOSE THEM THE SENATE POSSIBLY THE HOUSE AS WELL AND HIS COAT TAILS BUT THERE ARE OTHERS A FEW DEMOCRATS WOULD SAY HANG ON A MINUTE
TRUMP HAS MANAGED TO MOBILISE THIS ANGER SO AS BERNIE SANDERS THERE THAT IS A LESSON THAT TRUMP WILL LEARN AND IN SEPTEMBER HE WILL BECOME A DIFFERENT KIND OF CANDIDATE AND ANYONE WHO THINKS IF IT'S CLINTON TRUMP IT'S GOING TO BE A WALKOVER
HAD BETTER START WATCHING HIM VERY CAREFULLY
THANKS VERY MUCH PUT ON IT'S TWENTY FIVE PAST EIGHT THOUSANDS OF JEWS WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE NAZI GERMANY JUST BEFORE THE WAR BROKE OUT BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS OF A BRITISH INTELLIGENCE OFFICER HIS NAME WAS FRANK FOLEY AND HISTORIANS HAS BEEN TOLD IN A BOOK BY MICHAEL SMITH WHO WAS WITH ME
SO IS WERNER LACKS ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAVED BY FULLY MISTER MAX IS IN A RADIO CAR MISTER SMITH
WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN WHAT WAS ONLY AT THE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE WAS IT NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT BUT WET WHEN DID THIS MAN BEGIN TO DO WHAT HE WAS DOING HE WAS AN M.I.SIX HEAD OF STATION IN BERLIN IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER HITLER CAME TO POWER
JEWS BEGAN TO WANT TO GO TO BRITAIN AND THE COVER FOR M.I.SIX OFFICERS ABROAD AT THE TIME WAS PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER SO THEY CONTROLLED WHO CAME TO BRITAIN AND TO ANYWHERE IN THE EMPIRE AND PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR THE JEWS PALESTINE BECAUSE WE UM WE ADMINISTERED IT UNDER MANDATE FROM THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS SO HE WAS WHAT HE WAS BREAKING THE RULES FRANK FOLEY BY ISSUING PASSPORTS PERMITS THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ISSUED
EXACTLY I MEAN TEARING UP THE RULES REALLY I MEAN IT WASN'T JUST SORT OF NUDGING HERE OR NUDGING IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY BREAKING AROSE ROAST WAS IT AIN'T A RISK HIMSELF HE WAS TAKING A RISK HIMSELF FOR HER
IN LATE NINETEEN THIRTY NIGHT FOR THIRTY EIGHT AFTER CHRIS STAR KNOCKED WHEN THE NAZIS ATTACKED AND ALL THE MALE JEWS WERE ON THE RUN WE COULD BE IF YOU WERE A MALE JEWS YOU'RE GOING TO BE DRAGGED OFF TO A CONCENTRATION CAMP IAN HIS WIFE HE DID THREE OR FOUR JEWS IN THEIR APARTMENT EVERY NIGHT IN BERLIN
FOLEY WENT INTO CONCENTRATION CAMPS TO FRONT UP THE S.S. GUARDS AND GET GUYS OUT HE HAD NO DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY M.I.SIX OFFICERS AT THE TIME DIDN'T HAVE ANY DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY AND BECAUSE HE HAD TO LIAISE WITH THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES OVER SOVIET SPIES IN HIS PREVIOUS
PERIOD IN THE TWENTIES THEY KNEW FULL WELL THAT HE WAS US A BRITISH SPY HE COULD'VE BEEN ARRESTED AT ANY TIME VERY VERY KNOWING IT'S A VERY BRAVE MAN VERY BRAVE MINE'S A CERTAIN LET'S TALK TO IF I MADE MISTER LACKS BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY WERE RESCUED YOU WITH THEM AT THE TIME OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON YOU YOU DIDN'T DISCOVER UNTIL MANY MANY YEARS LATER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THAT'S CORRECT IT WAS THE MID NINETIES WHEN I READ THE LETTER AND THE ASSOCIATION OF JEWISH REFUGEES MAGAZINE FROM MICHAEL SMITH
ASKING TO BE CONTACTED BY ANYONE WHO HAD CONNECTIONS WITH THE BIRD IN A PASSPORT OFFICE
IN THE PERIOD FROM CHRIS TELL THAT TO THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR SO I RANG HIM AND THIS IS HOW THE STORY INVOLVED AS FAR AS MY CONCERN I HAD NO IDEA WHO IT WAS WHO ISSUED A VISA TO COME TO ENGLAND IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND I WAS INTERESTED TO READ THAT YOU FELT OBVIOUSLY ELATED AND MASSIVELY GRATEFUL FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO YOU BUT ALSO SLIGHTLY GUILTY
WELL THE IS THAT THE RIGHT WHERE WE WERE ANXIOUS ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE AS A RESULT OF WHICH SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT HAVE LOST OUT BUT WE WERE RELIEVED WHEN WE FOUND OUT WHAT THE REAL REASON WAS WHY WE GOT OUR VISA WHEN WE THOUGHT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO AND YOU WERE SEEING FRIENDS RELATIVES ALL AROUND YOU BEING TAKEN OFF TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND
WELL THERE'S A BIT LEFT BEFORE THAT BUT I DO KNOW THIS THEIRSELF BOTH OF MY NEAR RELATIVE WHO FAILED TO EMIGRATE AND NONE SURVIVED THE WAR NONE OF THEM HERE AM I
NONE OF THEM MY GRAND GRANDMOTHERS UNCLES AUNTS COUSINS UNFORTUNATELY NONE SURVIVED SO WHEN YOU THINK OF FRANK FOLEY TODAY WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HIM
HERE'S MY SAVE MY SAINTLY SAVIOUR THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY IT'S A GREAT PITY THAT HE PASSED AWAY BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET HIM AND HE DID MEET SOME OF HIS FAMILY AND I'VE ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO BE THERE WHEN THEY UNVEILED TO MY MORALS TO HIM AND A FAR AS I'M CONCERNED HERE WILL WE ALWAYS MY SAVING HERO

PREFERABLY I FEEL NOT BUT THERE YOU GO THAT'S ALL JUST AFTER MY LAVER BREAD INDEED LILY THANK YOU WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE IT'S GONNA BE MAINLY SUNNY CLIP WITH CLEAR SKIES A BIT OF RAIN IN THE NORTH THOUGH YOUR UNDERSTATED TODAY ON RADIO FOUR THE SORT OF MODE IF YOU WERE JOHN HUMPHRYS TWENTY FIVE DENYING THE NEWS FROM CAROLINE NICHOLS
PRINCE WILLIAM HAS SOUGHT TO DEFLECT CRITICISM OF HIS COMMITMENT TO HIS ROYAL DUTIES SO HE'S CONCENTRATING ON HIS ROLE AS A FATHER BUT HE'S ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO TAKE ON MORE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THE TIME COMES THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE ALSO DESCRIBED THE QUEEN WHOSE NINETIETH BIRTHDAY IS TOMORROW AS A GUIDING EXAMPLE OF WHAT A MONARCH SHOULD BE
EIGHT FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARIES HAVE JOINTLY WRITTEN AN ARTICLE ADVISING THAT STAYING WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION REPRESENTS BRITAIN'S BEST CHANCE OF SECURING ITS FUTURE BUT THE LEAF CAMPAIGNER AND FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY LIAM FOX TOLD US THEIR ANALYSIS WAS FLAWED
DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON HAD REASSERTED THEIR STATUS AS FRONTRUNNERS TO BE THEIR PARTY'S CANDIDATES FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AFTER SECURING COMFORTABLE VICTORIES IN THE NEW YORK PRIMARIES MISTER TRUMP SAID IT WAS NOW ALL BUT MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIS MAIN REPUBLICAN RIVAL TED CREWS TO GAIN THE NOMINATION
A GROUP OF M.P.S HAS SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND WHERE BRITISH AID MONEY FOR INTERNATIONAL CRISES DISPERSED BY UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES IS BEING SPENT IT SAYS TURF WARS BETWEEN THE U.N. BODY'S INHIBITING ACCOUNTABILITY
THE TIME TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINE HOW DO YOU VOTE IF YOU LIKE WHAT THE CONSERVATIVE SAY ON THE ECONOMY WHAT LABOUR SAYS ON SOCIAL JUSTICE WHAT THE LIMO LIBERAL DEMOCRATS SAY ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHAT THE GREENS SAY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND IF YOU FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY AND WANT TO GET INTO POLITICS WHICH PARTY SHOULD YOU JOIN IF INDEED YOU SHOULD JOIN ONE AT ALL
WELL DAVID CAMERON'S FORMER DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY STEVE HILTON RECKONS HIS LATEST PROJECT COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS HE SET IT UP IN THE STATES AND HE'S NOW BRING IT HERE HE'S HERE WITH IN THE STUDIO AND AS IS CLAIRE EMES WHOSE CHIEF INNOVATION OFFICER
IT'S US MARI THE POLLING ORGANISATION GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING MORNING THAT'S EVIL THAT IS QUITE A BIG CLAIM THAT WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE WHAT IS I SUPPOSE MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT SUGGEST HAS BEEN A PROBLEM OF POLITICS
I THINK IT IS A BIG PROBLEM AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED IN MANY PARTS OF OUR LIVES OF THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH TECHNOLOGY WHETHER THAT'S TRAVEL OR SHOPPING ON THE WAY WE CONSUME MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGIES GIVEN PEOPLE A LOT MORE CHOICES AND PUT REAL POWER IN THEIR HANDS BUT IN SOMETHING THAT'S ARGUABLY MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THE WAY WE CHOOSE OUR GOVERNMENTS IT'S HARDLY HAD AN IMPACT AND WE SEEM TO BE STUCK WITH THIS SAME ROTTEN OLD TWO PARTY SYSTEM THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE DISSATISFIED WITH AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH CRAB BACK
IS BREAK THE STRANGLEHOLD OF THE WESTMINSTER ESTABLISHMENT AND THE BIG PARTY MACHINES THAT CONTROL EVERYTHING AND MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR MORE INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES AND INDEPENDENT MINDED CANDIDATES TO RUN FOR OFFICE LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY AND THEN ALSO TO GIVE VOTERS BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT WHO'S ON THEIR BALLET SO THEY CAN SEE THAT SOMETIMES THE INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE OR THE CANDIDATE FROM WHAT'S OFTEN DESCRIBED AS THE MINORITY PARTY THE SMALLER PARTIES MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A BETTER MATCH FOR THEM OH KAY BECAUSE YOU WERE PUT ON THERE
NOT NECESSARILY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING BUT HOW THEY'RE VOTING THAT'S RIGHT AND WE AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE STATES IS DEVELOP US A COMPLEX SET OF DATA ANALYSIS AND ALGORITHMS THAT ACTUALLY OBJECTIVELY LOOK WHERE THE CANDIDATE STAND BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ALL RIGHT NOW THE WAY WE DO THAT HERE WE'RE JUST STARTING TODAY LES TODAY WILL BE PUBLISHING SOME DATA ON THE LONDON MAYORAL CANDIDATES FOR EXAMPLE
FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE LOOKING NOT JUST DO WHAT THEY SAY BUT WHAT THEIR TWITTER SOCIAL NETWORKS SAY ABOUT THEM WHO FOLLOWS THEM AND WHO THEY FOLLOW WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THAT ABOUT WHERE THEY STAND POLITICALLY I GOING ON YOUR WEBSITE WHICH AS YOU SAY LAUNCHED IN THE U.K. HERE TODAY AND YOU'VE GOT UNDER CAMPAIGNS AND THIS IS PRESUMABLY THE LONDON MAYORAL CAMPAIGN ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE PARTIES YOU HAVE ALL THE INDIVIDUALS IS THAT RIGHT
THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT INFORMATION ABOUT EVERYONE BUT WE'RE ALSO DOING IS ENABLING PEOPLE TO DONATE TO CAMPAIGNS THAT THEY CARE ABOUT AND THROUGH A CROWD FOR THAT WELL WE DON'T ALL HAVE CANDIDATES BEYOND THERE YOU DO KNOW IF THEY WANT TO BE WI IF THEY WANT TO BE AND WE WOULD WELCOME ANY MORE CAMPAIGNS ON THERE WE HAVE THE GREEN CANDIDATE ON THERE I THINK LABOUR ON THERE IF THE OTHERS WANT TO JOIN THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC IT'S OPEN TO EVERYONE CLAIRE AIMS CAN YOU SEE THIS MAKING A DIFFERENCE TO WHAT WE KNOW OF ARE THEY
POLITICS WELL I THINK STEVE'S RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE SEEN THIS DECLINE IN SORT OF TRIBAL PARTY POLITICS IF WE LOOK BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE ELECTION NINETY SIX PERCENT OF PEOPLE WERE VOTING FOR THE CONSERVATIVES OR LABOUR WHERE IS IN TWENTY WHAT THEIR PARENTS HAD VOTED FOR IT WAS VERY SIMPLE IT WAS HANDED DOWN ABSOLUTELY RISEN TWENTY FIFTEEN IT WAS MORE LIKE SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING IF WE DIG INTO THAT IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A GENERATIONAL ISSUE
AND WE'RE FINDING THAT IT'S THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS THAT ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH ONE PARTY OR ANOTHER SO
IF WE LOOK AT SORT OF GEN Y. THE MILLENNIAL SO THESE ARE PEOPLE IN THEIR LATE TEENS TO EARLY THIRTY FIVES ONLY ONE OR TWO OF THEM IN TEN WILL SAY THEY ACTUALLY ASSOCIATE WE'RE O.K. SO IT'S A TREND THAT IT WILL CONTINUE IF GIVEN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AS WE AS WE SEE SORT OF THE PRE WAR GENERATION IN THEIR SEVENTIES WHO ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO ALIGN WITH TRIBAL POLITICS DYING OUT THEN I WOULD SAY YES WE WILL SEE A DECLINE IN TRADITIONAL PARTY POLITICS THAT WE STILL HAVE A FIRST PAST THE POST SYSTEM IT'S ALL VERY WELL VOTING FOR SOMEBODY BUT THEY THEN SINK WITHOUT TRACE WHAT WAS THE POINT
I THINK THE TROUBLE IS AS MUCH A SINKING WITHOUT TRACE THEY CAN'T EVEN RISE BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS THAT THEY'RE THERE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND SAY THAT WHEN YOU COME TO VOTE IT'S NOT JUST THE OBVIOUS CHOICES IT COULD BE PEOPLE IN YOUR AREA THAT ACTUALLY MATCH YOUR PRIORITIES MUCH MORE CLOSELY NOW FREAK IF WE PUT OWNERS AND CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE WAY THE POLITICAL SYSTEM WORKS YES BUT IT MEANS THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT YOU CAN GET KNOWN AND IT'S NOT STARTING SMALL PERHAPS MAYBE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ACTUALLY SHOW PEOPLE THAT A NEW KIND OF POLITICS AS POSSIBLE IN THE U.S. FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THAT JUST TO YOUR POINT MANY YOUNGER PEOPLE
MUCH WORK MUCH MORE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE USING OUR MANY MORE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE USING CRAFT BACK IN THE U.S. MORE THAN HALF OF OUR USERS AND THEY'RE USING ON THEIR PHONES AND IT'S JUST IT'S WITH THE WAY THEY WANT TO LIVE THEIR LIVES AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE ISN'T IT CLAIMS THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE TO POLITICS IN THE STATES THE WAY THAT IT HASN'T HERE
YES AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS PERHAPS BECAUSE PERSONALITY IS MUCH MORE HAS MUCH MORE OF AN IMPACT I STILL THINK PARTY WILL HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN THE U.K. IN PARTICULAR IT'S A HEURISTIC IT'S A SHORT CUT THE PEOPLE USE WE DON'T NECESSARILY DO LOTS OF RESEARCH INTO THE CANDIDATES THEMSELVES ALSO THE PARTY MACHINE HAS SUCH A HUGE ROLE TO PLAY IN TERMS OF SORT OF GETTING THE BOAT OUT AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S PARTLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO OPEN A HARLEY TOTALLY THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SHAKE UP THIS IS SO WEIRD
WHO ARE YOU WHAT DAVID CAMERON'S DIRECTORY STRATEGY YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING ENOUGH OF THAT ENOUGH OF THE CONSERVATIVES WELL I HAVE TO BE HONEST I THINK I'VE BEEN CONSISTENT ABOUT THIS THERE'S THAT THERE'S A PHRASE THAT WAS MUCH MOCKED AT THE TIME BUT WHAT DAVID CAMERON USED TO TALK ABOUT IT AND I WAS VERY MUCH PART OF THAT I DID THE POST BUREAUCRATIC AGE AND THE IDEA BEHIND THAT WAS THAT RIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS TRY AND PUT POWER IN PEOPLE'S HANDS USING TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION TO GIVE THEM CHOICES THEY NEVER HAD BEFORE SO WHAT I'M DOING NOW WITH CRAB PACK
IS BASICALLY THE SAME SORT OF ARGUMENT THAT WE WERE MAKING ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WITH DAVID CAMERA IF IT'S BUT ABOUT PUTTING YOUR FORMER COLLEAGUE MICHAEL GAVE SAID WHEN HE WAS VOTING FOR LEAVE OR SAID HE WAS COMING OUT FOR LEAVE
BUT AS A MINISTER I'VE SEEN HUNDREDS OF NEW E.U. RULES CROSSED MY DESK NONE OF WHICH WERE REQUESTED NONE OF WHICH I OR ANY OTHER BRITISH POLITICIAN COULD ALTER IN ANY WAY WAS THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE AND IS IT WHY YOU WOULD VOTE TO LEAVE WELL I'M LOOKING TO GET INTO THAT TODAY OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT IT'S MANY PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT I THINK YOU'D FIND DAVID CAMERON PROBABLY AGREEING WITH THAT EVEN SOMEONE LIKE NICK CLEGG I REMEMBER BEING VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE WAY
IMPACTED DAILY LIFE IN GOVERNMENT SO I DON'T THINK THAT NECESSARILY WOULD PUSH YOU IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER I THINK THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IS ANOTHER EXAM WOULD NIPPERS SHOO THEM I THINK IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE NEED CROWD PACK FRANKLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SEEING ALL THESE ARGUMENTS BUT YOU VOTE LEAVE AND I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE ARGUMENT WE HAVE NON NON POLITICAL AND IMPARTIAL WE JUST A PLATFORM FORGIVING POLITICS BACK TO PEOPLE AND GIVING THEM GOOD OBJECTIVE INFORMATION REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT EFFECT IT HAD STEVE HILTON CLAIMS THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU
SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO LINE THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD NEXT MONTH'S ELECTIONS TO THE STORMONT ASSEMBLY WILL BE THE FIRST IN WHICH ANYONE BORN AFTER THE SIGNING OF THAT HISTORIC PIECE DEAL IT REALLY WAS HISTORIC WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE BUT WHAT DO THE SO CALLED GOOD FRIDAY GENERATION THINK OF THE STILL DEEPLY DIVIDED WORLD OF POLITICS IN NORTHERN IRELAND OUR IRELAND CORRESPONDENT CHRIS BUTLER'S BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT
STRETCHED ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND'S NORTH COAST ARE MILES OF BEACHES SPECTACULAR SCENERY AND B.
THE BEST ELVIS FROM EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SUFFERERS AND STUDENTS ROYAL ARMSTRONG AND ROSS HEY BYRON THIS IS THE NORTHERN IRELAND BAINNE
THEY GREW UP IN AN ERA OF RELATIVE PEACE TO THEN THE TROUBLES IS HISTORY THEY LEARNT NOT
ACTUALLY WENT OVER AND WAS TALKING TO ALL THE PEOPLE FROM SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND AND YOU TELL THEM YOU'RE FROM NORTHERN IRELAND AND THEY'RE JUST
AND IS EVERYTHING O.K. IS IT IS IT IS A STUDY IN DRESS AND THEY SEEM TO THINK IT'S STILL HAPPENING MAKE THEIR TROUBLES ARE STILL GOING AND THEY DON'T REALISE HOW FAR WE'VE COME
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL THEM GO OVER THERE AND FIND OUT YOURSELF THE JOB PROSPECTS HERE ARE THEY ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU THERE
FROM SPEAKING TO PEOPLE I'VE BEEN TO UNIVERSITY AND THE PISTONS THEY'VE GOT

THOSE WERE DECADES WHEN THE ECONOMY SUFFERED AND YOU CAN SEE IN TIGNES HERE IT HASN'T FULLY RECOVERED THERE'S ALSO STILL DIVISION
UNIONISTS OR NATIONALS MAY WORK TOGETHER IN GOVERNMENT BUT THAT POWER SHARING COALITION AT THE STORMONT ASSEMBLY HAS COME CLOSE TO COLLAPSE MANY TIMES EVEN WITHIN THE LAST YEAR

WE REACHED A MAXIM WITH ENOUGH COME TO ACCUSE ADVISOR MET WHAT WE HAD TO DELIVER THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS LOOK TO PROVIDE THAT TRAINING TO TRAINING DEPARTMENT WITHIN LARGE P.L.C.S I'VE JUST SECURITY MANAGER WHICH THEY CAN CASCADE THAT INFORMATION TO THE STUFF AND THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S THE THINKING THAT WHEN THE BOMB FIRST GOES OFF SOMEWHERE WHEN WE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY IN BRUSSELS BUT AND ALSO PARIS WHEN AT THE BOMB GOES OFF IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME FOR POLICE TO GET THERE AND IT'S HOW PEOPLE REACT IMMEDIATELY THAT CAN
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IT'S IS SIMPLY TO GIVE PEOPLE THE NORWICH AND GIVE PEOPLE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO I LOOK AT MAKE A FROSTED COURSE APOSTATE COURSE DOES THAT MAKE YOU DOCTOR BUT IT GIVES YOU THE CONFIDENCE AND THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE ABLE TO CATCH SOME OF THE COLLAPSES IN FRONT YOU WHAT OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO SEEM WHICH WHEN YOU'VE GOT A PLANE YOU GET UP WE WIN THE STRAINING TO WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IF THERE'S AN ACCIDENT IT'S VERY SIMPLE LIKE THAT OH KAY PROFESSOR GREENBERG WHAT ARE THE SORT OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN TELL SOMEBODY THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY IN IN WHAT THEY DO
SO I THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE IN THE MISTS OF TURBAN INSTANT IS THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE WHO DO TAKE SOME DECISIVE ACTION THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE WHO GET INTO A BIT OF A HIGH ANXIETY STATE OR PANIC BUT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE BEWILDERED OR BEFUDDLED AND DON'T REALLY QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO AND I GUESS IF YOU CAN PROVIDE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POSITIONS OF EVEN MINE OF RESPONSIBILITY WITH THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE CLEARLY WITH THOSE WHO HE MIGHT BE STANDING AROUND WONDERING WHAT TO DO
IF THEY THEMSELVES CAN CAN BRING THAT ANXIETY LEVELS DOWN THERE WHAT YOU COULD DO IS POTENTIALLY LEAD THEM TO SOMEWHERE THAT'S SAFE SO AND I THINK GIVING TRAINING THAT ALLOWS THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE TRAINED TO TO TAKE SOME DECISIVE ACTION COMMUNICATE CLEARLY AND AND MANAGE THEIR OWN ANXIETY I THINK COULD BE REALLY GOOD NEWS WE'RE TALKING HERE DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT SCOTT WHAT ABOUT A FEW HOURS TRAINING ARMY WHAT IT WHAT DO YOU TELL PEOPLE WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME THAT THE STEAM IN PRINCIPLES TO THE TREATMENT
THE PRINCIPLE AS LOOKING UP WHAT IS THE ACTUAL THEATRE OPEN AND WE GO THROUGH WHAT THE FREIGHTERS WHETHER THAT'S A VEHICLE BORNE A MUDDY WHAT CAN TESS THAT'S WHAT THREAT COULD BE FIERCE WITHIN LOOK AT WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU'RE CO OPERATIVES AND ELLA HAVE YOU WERE RELEASED RUN HATING TAIL WHICH AGAIN A SURVEY SIMPLISTIC VIDEO FIVE MINUTE BUT WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T DO A FOOT CAUGHT UP IN A TELL US
AND WITH THIS UNPACK IS THAT JUNE BETWEEN FOR THE RUN HIDE TELL MEANING WHAT BISSELL IF YOU'RE CAUGHT ON THE TEST WHAT WE SEE YOU SHOULDN'T BE CONFRONTING YOU SHOULD BE NEGOTIATE WITH A TERRORIST CAUSE OR TELL US THEY ARE TOO STUPID WANT TO STEW BEFORE THERE'LL BE A TWO O.K. SEE YOU EITHER RUN YOU HIDE OR YOU GO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE RUN IF YOU CAN'T RUN YOU SHOULD HATE AND IF YOU CAN'T HAVE THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD BE TELLING THE FOREST IS THAT THIS IS TAKING PLACE WITHIN YOUR PREMISES WE HAVE QUINN HOW MANY SUCK EPIC SUCCESS IT IS ISN'T IT OBVIOUS HE'S NOT PEOPLE I'M IN OR PERHAPS I SHOULD ASK YOU PERVERT SCREAM BUT ISN'T THAT THE INSTINCTIVE REACTION OF AN END OF IT
I THINK PROBABLY IF YOU IF YOU WATCH TOO MANY FILMS YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IT WAS BUT AS I SAY THE THE EVIDENCE IS THAT MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET VERY BEWILDERED AND BEFUDDLED AND ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DON'T SO WHAT DO THEY DO IT SO THAT THEY STAND AROUND A LOOK WHAT LOOK LOOK ABOUT DOING OTHER DOING NOTHING OR FOLLOWING SOMEONE HE MIGHT SEEM TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW IS THEY'RE BRIEFING THAT CAN MAKE THEM BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY OR IS IT WHAT YOU'RE GIVING THE BRIEFING TO IS THOSE WHO ARE NATURALLY A BIT MORE SWITCHED ON IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCES TO GUIDE THOSE WHO BEFUDDLED
SO JUST TAKE YOU BACK TO THE LONDON BOMBINGS TIME IT THIS IS A SORT OF IMPORTANT PIECE OF RESEARCH THAT I MIGHT INFORM YOUR QUESTION WE DID SOME RESEARCH FROM KING'S COLLEGE LONDON LOOKING AT THE POPULATION IN LONDON ABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER THE LONDON BOMBINGS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS PEOPLE WHO HAD READ THE GOVERNMENT INFORMATION LEAFLET THAT WERE SENT OUT PREVIOUSLY ABOUT HOW TO COPE IN A MAJOR INCIDENT DID BETTER PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAN THOSE WHO HAVEN'T READ THE LEAFLET
WE CAN'T BE SURE IT'S WHETHER IT'S THE LEAFLET DID WHAT IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT OR AFTERWARDS IS BETTER IN THE HEAT THE MOMENT AND BETTER AFTERWARD PSYCHOLOGICALLY THEY WERE LESS DISTRESSED SUGGESTING THAT ACTUALLY THAT THAT INFORMATION MAY HAVE HAD A DIFFERENT HOWEVER JUST AS YOU SAID IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THOSE WHO ARE MORE PROACTIVE MY PREPARED HAD READ THE LEAFLET AND THE OTHERS HAVEN'T WE DON'T KNOW FROM THAT PIECE OF RESEARCH INDEED BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO ALL YOU CAN TO PREPARE FOR DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT SCOTT WILSON PROFESSOR NEIL GREENBERG THANK YOU
FIVE DENIAL HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN A PICTURE OF YOUR DINNER AND PUT IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND IF NOT WHY NOT EVERYONE ELSE SEEMS TO BE DOING AT ALTHOUGH THIS WEEK IT WAS REPORTED THAT ROYAL NAVY FIRST HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM DOING IT WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO I'M JOINED BY ROSE PRINCE OF TELEGRAPH FOOD WRITER AND MICHAEL'S HERE FOOD BLOGGER AND CREATOR OF
SYMMETRY BREAKFAST SO I GOT THAT RIGHT MUDDY RIGHT THAT'S AN INSTRUMENT TO COUNT THE CHOSE PICTURES OF FOOD AND I'D READ HERE THAT YOU'VE LEFT YOUR FULL TIME JOB AND NOW YOU TAKE PHOTOS OF YOUR BREAKFAST AS YOUR FULL TIME JOB REALLY YEAH HOW DO YOU THINK I DO THAT

COULDN'T YOU JUST A BIT BORING IT'S A COOK BOOK IT'S A CUT ONE HUNDRED RECIPES RIGHT O.K. MORE INTERESTING
AND IT KIND OF IT'S BRINGING TOGETHER OTHER INTEREST BEYOND THEIR KIND OF INSTAGRAM ALL RIGHT BUT WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT ABOUT TAKING PICTURES OF A MEAL UM A SUE ASSUMING THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS TO SEE IT I THINK THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF ANSWERS TO THAT SO THEN THERE IS THE KIND OF NARCISSISTIC SIDE OF THINGS WHERE YOU CAN SAY
THIS IS ME LOOK WHAT I'M DOING YOU ARE HERE YOU'RE NOT PARTICIPATING AS A KIND OF ONE UP MANSION ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE IS THE REAL THING A MEAL DOESN'T IT OR HOW MUCH WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT BUT THEN THERE'S THE OTHER END THERE'S OWN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF POSITIVITY IN SUPPORTING
INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS OF FOOD SMALL RESTAURANTS SHARING A MOMENT WITH FRIENDS I THINK FOOD LENDS ITSELF TO BEING SHED WHICH IS WHY WE DO IT RIGHT I DO YOU GAVE HER THAT ROSE OH I THINK WE SHOULD I DON'T PHOTOGRAPH MY MEALS PARTICLE ALWAYS FORGET OUT OF FINISH SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PHOTOGRAPH AND PUT IT ON PUT IT ON MEDIUM AND I I DON'T I DON'T GET ROUND TO IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BEING IN MY

REALLY MATTERS IS THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE PICTURES VENUE MISUSED THE WRITING TO VISUALISE AND I THINK THAT'S A DISCIPLINE AND A GREAT ONE FOR A FOOD WRITER
