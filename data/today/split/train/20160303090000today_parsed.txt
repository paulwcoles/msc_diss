GROUP LATER IN THE PROGRAMME AND THE DAILY MAIL AS A STRIKING FRONT PAGE PHOTOGRAPH A LITTLE BOY AGED EIGHT AND IT SAYS THAT THE SCHOOL CALLED IN SOCIAL WORKERS AFTER HE SAID IN CLASS LET ME LET ME FIGHT ISIS AT THE OLD DOESN'T HAVE THE PHRASE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS GONE MAD BUT IT'S CLEARLY MEANT TO CONVEY THAT LOT OF COVERAGE IN THE PAPERS OF ADAM JOHNSON THE FORMER ENGLAND AND SUNDERLAND FOOTBALL ARE FOUND GUILTY YESTERDAY OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD
THE TIME SAYS THAT SUNDERLAND HAS QUESTIONS TO ANSWER BECAUSE IT ALLOWED ADAM JOHNSON TO PLAY ON FOR MONTHS EARNING ABOUT THREE MILLION POUNDS DESPITE HAVING HAD THE DETAILS OF CHILD SEX CHARGES AGAINST HIM HE WAS INITIALLY SUSPENDED AFTER HIS ARREST FOR RETURN TO THE PITCH
WITHIN WEEKS ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT HE WOULD DENY THE CHARGES HE LATER CHANGED HIS PLEA TO ADMIT TWO OF THE FOUR CHARGES THE CLUB SAYS THAT HAD IT KNOWN HE INTENDED TO PLEAD GUILTY IT WOULD HAVE TERMINATED HIS CONTRACT IMMEDIATELY STRIKING HEADLINE IN THE TIMES PUTIN WEAPON ISING MIGRANTS THIS IS NATO CLAIMING THAT THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT IS USING THE MIGRATION CRISIS TO PUSH EUROPE TO THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE NO MAN IS GOING TO CHAIR A VITAL SUMMIT ON THAT SUBJECT NEXT MONDAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK
HE'S HEADING TO GREECE TODAY ARE YOUR CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS IS THERE IS ON THE ISLAND OF LESBOS MORNING TO YOU CHRIS THE NUMBERS KEEP ON COMING
THEY DO NICK YES IT'S SUNNY DAY HERE CALM SEAS I'M LOOKING OUT TOWARDS THE TURKISH COAST THAT ALL MEANS IT'S ANOTHER GOOD DAY FOR THE SMUGGLERS ONLY YESTERDAY LET'S PUT ALONE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE ARRIVED ON SMALL BOATS AND NOTHING MY DES DOES REALLY WILL MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE EVEN IF ALL THE COUNTRIES IN THE BALKANS KISS AND MAKE UP A FAYE
MANAGED TO REACH CONSENSUS AROUND THE TABLE OF ME YOU SUMMIT NEXT MONDAY ABOUT THE WAY FORWARD IF THE NUMBERS DON'T FALL AND FALL PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY INTO THE LOW SINGLE FIGURES REALLY I THINK ALL POLICIES WILL GET SWEPT AWAY JUST IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING ARRIVING AND THE INABILITY OF SYSTEMS IN EUROPE TO COPE SO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY KEY TO EUROPE'S MIGRATION POLICY WE'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR MONTHS REALLY BUT I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE POLICY TOWARDS THE MIGRATION
CRISIS WILL STAND OR FALL CAN THE E.U. TOGETHER WITH TURKEY ENGINEER A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THESE ARRIVALS WE'RE NOT SEEING IT YET AND TOGETHER IS A CRUCIAL WORD ISN'T IT CHRIS BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THE BALKAN STATES I'VE BEEN INTERVIEWING ALSO A SPOKESMAN FOR THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT WHO EFFECTIVELY HAVE DECIDED THE YOU CAN'T HACK THIS WE'RE GONNA DECIDE ON OUR OWN SET HER OWN CAPS OUR OWN BORDERS OUR OWN WIRE FENCES
AND OBVIOUSLY THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT ARE FELT MOST KEENLY IN GREECE BECAUSE THOSE RESTRICTIONS ON BORDERS SEND CONCERTINA DOWN THROUGH THE BALKANS AND THE ONE COUNTRY THAT CAN'T CLOSE ITS BORDER COS IT'S BORDER IS THE SEA AND YOU CAN'T FENCE THE SEA IS GREASE AND LISTENING TO GREEK GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN THE MEDIA OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THEY'RE CLEARLY PREPARING PEOPLE FOR THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER GOING TO BE A TRANSIT COUNTRY FOR REFUGEES THEY'RE GOING TO BE A RECEPTION COUNTRY THE E. YOUSE TALKING ABOUT
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE SHIFTING POPULATION OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR SOME TIME TO COME THE GROUP SEEM TO BE TALKING ABOUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AFTER HER ALREADY WE HAVE BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN PRETTY GRIM
BY THE MACEDONIAN BORDER TRYING TO GET ACROSS THAT BORDER A SIMILAR NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN TEMPORARY CAMPS IN AND AROUND ATHENS AND ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY OF COURSE
PROBABLY WITH WITH NO COMPARISON ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE IS UNABLE TO DEAL ALL THIS BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WHICH IS BUT IT WHICH IS HIT THIS COUNTRY FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS THEIR CAPACITY TO RESPOND SWIFTLY TO A CRISIS OF THIS MAGNITUDE IS REALLY LACKING IN GREECE AT THE MOMENT AND THAT'S WHY IT DOES NEED EXTERNAL HELP
CHRIS MORRIS ON THE ISLE OF LESBOS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THAT INTERVIEW WITH SPLIT TO THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT AFTER TEN PAST SEVEN IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX GOVERNMENT PLANS TO SELL OFF HIGH VALUE COUNCIL HOUSING WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY EFFECT ELDERLY AND DISABLED PEOPLE BECAUSE BUNGALOWS WILL BE THE FIRST TO GO ARE SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL BUCHANAN IS ON THE LINE AND THIS IS BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT OF A REPORT THAT'S RELEASED TODAY MICHAEL
INDEED GOOD MORNING IT'S THE REPORT THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE JUICE OF ROME FOR YOUR FOUNDATION OR LAST ACADEMICS AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY TO LOOK INTO THE EFFECTS OF THE EXTENSION OF RIGHT TO BUY TO HOUSING ASSOCIATION TENANTS AND JUST BRIEFLY THAT SCHEME IS THE HOUSING ASSOCIATION TENANT WILL BE ALLOWED TO BUY THEIR PROPERTIES AT A DISCOUNT AND THAT'LL BE PAID FOR
COUNCIL SELLING OFF HIGH VALUE PROPERTIES WHEN THEY BECOME VACANT NO WHAT THIS REPORT THIS MORNING SEE IS THAT DUE TO THE LOW SUPPLY AND INCREDIBLY HIGH DEMAND FOR BUNGALOWS THAT IS LIKELY TO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT OLDER PEOPLE BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT ALL OF PEOPLE ARE LIKE LIVING IN BUNGALOWS ESPECIALLY ALL BECAUSE ABLED PEOPLE AND THOSE PROPERTIES THE REPORT TO DO THIS WILL BECOME VACANT MORE REGULARLY BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE MOVE IN TO PUT UP ALL THE
THEY SIMPLY DIED AND THEREFORE DUE TO THE HIGH DEMAND FOR THEM THAT'LL THAT'LL MAKE THEM APPEALING TO COUNCILS TO TO SELL OFF AND WHAT THE REPORT SAYS THAT WHILE ONLY NINE PER CENT OF COUNCIL STOP HIS I'D ACTUALLY BUNGALOWS THE ESTIMATE THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THESE HIGH VALUE SALES WILL ACTUALLY BE A BUNGALOW BUT MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND BUNGALOWS AND ENGLAND WILL BE SOLD OVER THE COMING FIVE YEARS SO WHAT ARE THEY SUGGESTING THAT VET FED BUNGALOWS ARE BARRED FROM SALE BY COUNSEL
IN ESSENCE YES THEY ARE SAYING THAT IT WAS A SIMILAR SCHEME TO WRITE TO BUY AN EXISTENCE THEY SAY IN NORTHERN IRELAND THIS IS IT AS IT IS AND IN NORTHERN IRELAND BUNGALOWS ARE EXEMPT FROM FROM THIS TYPE OF POLICY THIS SAY THAT WAS THE GOVERNMENT'S ARGUMENT AS THIS MONEY THE MONEY FROM HIGH VALUE SALES WILL BE USED TO ROOT TO BUILD REPLACEMENT HOLMES WHAT TODAY'S REPORT SUGGESTS IS THAT
EVEN IF THAT DOES HAPPEN AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF SCEPTICISM AS TO WHAT THAT WE'LL HAVE THAT WE'LL ACTUALLY HAVE BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE CASE OF BUNGALOWS THE ARGUMENT BEING PART OF THAT HIGHER CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SECONDLY THAT HAVE MORE ALARM NEEDED TO BUILD A BUNGALOW SO IT WOULDN'T BE IN THE INTERESTS OF ON THE PEOPLE BUILDING THEIR HOUSES TO REPLACE BUNGALOWS ONE FOR ONE
MICHAEL BUCHANAN THANK YOU IT IS JUST AFTER QUARTER PAST SIX TEN IS HERE WITH THE BUSINESS NEWS IN THE U.K. CAR INDUSTRY OVERWHELMINGLY BACKING OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE YOU WERE IN A SERIES OF CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATED STORIES IT SINTON YES WILL THE SOCIETY OF MOTOR MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS SAYS THREE QUARTERS OF ITS MEMBERS BELIEVE REMAINING IN EUROPE IS BEST FOR THEIR BUSINESS HER DECISION TO LEAVE COULD JEOPARDISE AN INDUSTRY RESPONSIBLE FOR EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS
AND A FIFTEEN BILLION POUND ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE U.K. ECONOMY THIS IS WHAT IT CLAIMS MY CAUSE IS THE S. M. ANTES CHIEF EXECUTIVE HE'S WITH ME NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MY MOMMY LET ME JUST REFER YOU TO THE QUESTION BUT DO YOU HAVE ASKED YOUR MEMBERS WHAT IT SAYS IS
IF PEOPLE STAY WOULD THIS BE BEST FOR THEM BUT IF THEY LEAVE WOULD IT NOT BE BEST FOR THEM WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A SHORT TERM CHANGE SURELY AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY I THINK NOBODY DISPUTES THIS FAIRLY DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE SHORT TERM PEOPLE ARE GOING TO OPT FOR SECURITY NOT WHAT WE'RE ASKING
OUR MEMBERS WAS IN FOR THEIR BUSINESS WHAT IS THE BEST OPTION IS TO REMAIN OR IS IT TO LEAVE OVER WHAT TIME FRANK THAT'S MY POINT IT IS IT IS CLEAR THAT THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM THIS IS A BUSINESS WITH DOES INVEST FOR THE LONG TERM AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO BE OVER THAT LONG TERM AND OBVIOUSLY WITH THIS REFERENDUM THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY WHEN INDEED YOU WOULD ACCEPT THAT BUT NOBODY KNOWS QUITE WHAT THE CONDITIONS WOULD BE WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUR MEMBERS IT IS THAT WHAT YOU APPEAR TO BE SUGGESTING
IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NO FF NO TRADE WITH WHAT REMAINS OF THE E.U. THAT'S CLEARLY NOT THE CASE NO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT AT ALL THERE IS WHEN PEOPLE WOULD SUGGEST THERE WILL BE A POTENTIAL FOR A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT NOW THAT IS NOT CERTAIN BUT IT IS LIKELY I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO ESTABLISH THAT FREE TRADE AGREEMENT BUT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE ISN'T JUST ON FREE TRADE SURE IT'S HUGE MARKET FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP AS AN INDUSTRY WE HAVE WITH EUROPE
IS ALSO THE ABILITY FOR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE TO FILL THE SKILLS GAP OF WHICH WE HAVE A LOT IT'S ALSO ABOUT CLEARLY YOU CAN TOO IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO TRADE WITH EUROPE YOU WHAT YOU WANT DO YOU HAVE TO PLAY BY THE RULES THAT YOU'RE UPSET AND IT'S BETTER THAT THE U.K. WAS AT THE TABLE SETTING THOSE RULES PROTECTING OUR INDUSTRY AND ENHANCING OUR INDUSTRY IT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT ISN'T THAT THAT'S NICELY THE BABE IN FACT WE HAVE VERY LITTLE LEVERAGE OVER ABOUT THEY'LL SEARCH ELSEWHERE THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT LEATHERS WE CAN CLEARLY THE RULES THAT APPLY TO EUROPE OR ESTABLISHED
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION VALIDATED OR CHANGED BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS ENSURING THAT THE SUCCESS THAT THE U.K. AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY HAS HAD AND THERE'S BEEN BUILT LARGELY ON GROWTH WITHIN EUROPE AND ABROAD THAT YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE MARKETS
AND THE BRITISH MOTOR INDUSTRY BENEFITS FROM THAT IN PARTICULAR THAT THE GERMANS WOULD HAVE A VERY STRONG INCENTIVE TO FOSTER TRADE RELATIONS THEY EXPORT HOW MANY MILLION CALLS TO BE CAN WHEEL THAT'S A BIT LESS THAN THAT BUT YES THEY DO AND THEY HAD THE CHOICE THAT THE CONSUMERS HAVE IN THE U.K. HUGELY BENEFICIAL BY HAVING CARS COME FROM ALL OVER EUROPE COME FROM JAPAN COME FROM AMERICA AND COME FROM THE U.K. AS WELL I'M GOING TO ALSO THINK ABOUT U.K. MANUFACTURING IT IS OUR BIGGEST MARKET OVER
HALF THE CARS THAT WE EXPORT GO TO THE REST OF EUROPE LET NOBODY IS SUGGESTING IN THE CAR INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW THAT THEY WOULD WITHDRAW PRODUCTION SURELY ON THE BASIS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE U.K. LEAVING THE E.U. OBVIOUSLY AN INVESTMENT IS VERY LONG TERM AND IT'S BASED ON MANY OTHER FACTORS PRODUCTIVITY BEING A LARGE PART ABSOLUTELY HIM THAT THE PRODUCTIVITY IN THE U.K. CAR INDUSTRY IS THE BEST IN EUROPE TO GUYS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY'VE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN FACT INDUSTRY AND WE JUST DON'T WANNA SEE THAT SUCCESS JEOPARDISED MY CALLS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
A LACK OF CLARITY IN GOVERNMENT ENERGY POLICY IS DETERRING INVESTMENT IN THE SECTOR THIS ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE COMMITTEE BUILT OF COURSE OF M.P.S IT SAYS A SERIES OF SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED POLICY CHANGES HAS SPOOKED INVESTORS AND COULD PUT AT RISK BILLIONS OF POUNDS WERE SPENDING ON NEW POWER GENERATION BUT IT'S CRITICAL TO KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE FUTURE MATTY NIGHT IS DIRECTOR OF ENERGY STRATEGY AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT SIEMENS IT HELPS TO BUILD POWER PLANTS AND IS THE U.K.'S LARGEST SUPPLIER OF WIND TURBINES HE GAVE EVIDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE AND WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM
GOOD MORNING TUMOUR SHOULD BUT THE GOOD MORNING BUT AS YOU SAID SEEMS EMPLOYS OVER SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE U.K. BUILDING ALL KINDS OF POWER STATIONS NOT JUST WIND TURBINES BUT ALSO GAS FIRED AND BOUND BY A MASS AND WE UNDERSTAND ENERGY AND ENERGY IS COMPLEX POWER STATIONS VITAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEY TAKE
TO PARLIAMENT TO DEVELOP AND THEN THEY OPERATE FOR ANOTHER MAYBE SIX SEVEN PARLIAMENTS AFTER THAT AND SO IF YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING SURELY THAT ENERGY POLICY SHOULD NOT CHANGE DURING THAT TIME NO BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT CHANGES IN A STABLE AND PREDICTABLE WAY RIGHT AND WHAT'S UNSTABLE ABOUT THE WAY IT'S CHANGED
WELL ENERGY IS COMPLICATED FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S NO NATURAL MARKET INN IN ELECTRICITY SINCE PRIVATISATION WE'VE HAD THREE DIFFERENT MARKETS OVERLAID WITH FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT LAYERS OF SUBSIDY REGIME AND THIS WEEK THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED FURTHER CHANGES TO THE CAPACITY MARKET IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHEN THOSE CHANGES ARE MADE
THEY'RE MADE BASED ON EVIDENCE AND WITH A LONG TERM CLEAR
PLAN AND HE'S A DANGER CERTAINLY OVER SEVERAL PARLIAMENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN SUDDEN CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED BASED ON
BACKBENCH OPINION RATHER THAN DETAILED IN WASH BUT IS IT NOT HIM INEVITABLE OVER TIME THAT SUBSIDY FOR LOW CARBON ENERGY PRODUCTION WILL BE REDUCED BECAUSE IT HAS TO STAND ON IT SOPHIE OWN TWO FEET BUT CONCERNS ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE A VERY SUDDEN JUMP AND THEN FALL IN THE OIL PRICE IS GOING TO INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT POLICY BECAUSE IN THE END CONSUMERS COME FIRST
YES AND IT'S RIGHT TO MANAGE THEIR COSTS TO CONSUMERS BUT THE TREASURY HAS AN INSTRUMENT CALLED THE LEVEE CONTROL FRAMEWORK AND THE REPORT EXPLAINS HOW THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY OF MANAGING COSTA CONSUMERS HITS IT FAILS BECAUSE OF THREE DIFFERENT THINGS IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY INCLUDE ALL OF THE SUBSIDIES JUST SOME OF THEM IT MISSES THE
IT LOOKS GROSS COSTS RATHER THAN MEND COST TO THE CUSTOMER AND HE ALSO MISSES THE FACT THAT PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF WIND SUBSIDIES EVERY POUND THAT YOU PAY IN THE AT THE HEADLINE SUBSIDY FOR WIND CUSTOMERS GET SIXTY PENCE BACK IN TERMS OF A REDUCTION IN THE WHOLESALE MARKET
THERE WE MUST LEAVE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED MATTHEW KNIGHT AND SEAMAN'S ONE THINK GOVERNMENT HAS DONE TO TRY TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT INTO THE GREEN ENERGY SECTOR WAS TO SET UP THE GREEN INVESTMENT BANK IT'S DESIGNED TO HELP FUNNEL INVESTMENT INTO RENEWABLES IT'S BEEN HOLY GOVERNMENT OWN FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS BUT NOW IT'S BEING SOLD TODAY MARKS THE START OF ITS PRIVATISATION PROCESS SEAN KINGSBURY IS ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE HE'S WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU SOON BYE
INTO THE GREEN INVESTMENT BACK WELL WE SEEING THAT THERE'S LOTS AND LOTS OF INTEREST OUT THERE IN THE MARKET AT THE TOUCH OF PROJECT WE ARE INTERESTING TO PEOPLE LIKE PENSION FUNDS TO PEOPLE WITH LONG DID HAVE LIABILITY IS LIKE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ALSO TO OTHER BANKS WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS SINCE WE STARTED BUILDING OUT THESE PROJECTS WE'VE BUILT OVER SEVENTY PROJECTS NOW
AND WHETHER A FULLY COMPLETED THEY'LL PRODUCE ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY HONORARY HOUSEHOLD IN THE U.K. TAX ON WHAT BASIS DO YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL COS YOU HAVEN'T MADE A VAST AMOUNT OF PROFIT WHILE THIS EURGH EH WE WILL WE WILL SEE THAT PROFIT NUMBER GO UP IT TAKES ABOUT TWO TO THREE YEARS TO ACTUALLY BUILD ON SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE SOME OF THE ONES THAT WE INVESTED IN
EARLY ON IN OUR LIFE OUR ONLY NIGHT COMING TO FRUITION AND STARTING TO PRODUCE POWER UNDER FOR PRODUCING CUP WE WERE HEARING FROM MATTHEW KNIGHT AND HIS COMPLAINT THAT THE ENVIRONMENT THE POLICY ENVIRONMENT IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING DO YOU HAVE THAT PROBLEM TOO WELL CERTAINLY WHEN ANY NEW GOVERNMENT COMES IN THEY CHANGE THINGS AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN AS YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A FOCUS ON LOOKING AT COSTS WE UNDERSTAND THAT
BUT THIS YEAR WE WILL INVEST MORE MONEY NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS THEN WE'VE EVER INVESTED BEFORE SO WE STILL SEE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD PROJECT SITE AND TO MAKE A GREAT PROFIT AND WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT YOU CANNOT GET ACCESS TO FUNDING YES WE PRIVATISATION IS CLEARLY IN PART ABOUT ISN'T IT THAT'S RIGHT THAT BRINGING A NEW FUNDING IS VITAL FOR OUR BUSINESS WE INVITE SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR AND OBVIOUSLY WILL NEED TO LOOK AT MORE SORT OF CAPITAL THAN JUST TO GOVERNMENT
SO AS WE LAUNCH THE PRIVATISATION PROCESS IT'S ABOUT SELLING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT CHAIR BUT ALSO BY RAISING MONEY TO DO MORE GREEN PROJECT I WAS MAKING THE POINT TO MARTY NIGHT BEFORE THAT GREEN ENERGY NOW THE VIEW IS ALL LOW CARBON ENERGY THE THE THE VIEW IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY THAT IT NEEDS TO BE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE IS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU FEEL ABLE TO PRIVATISE NOW
YES IT IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD UP A VERY SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BUSINESS IS STARTING TO TURN A PROFIT AS THOSE PROJECTS COME ON ONLINE AND WE SEE A LOT OF INTEREST FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON THOSE LOW RISK PROJECTS THAT GENERATE CASH WHO WAS VOLATILITY AND OTHER MARKETS WE PRODUCED VERY VERY STABLE CASH FLOW AND THAT MAKES US AN ATTRACTIVE ACQUISITION FOR PEOPLE LIKE PENSION FUNDS
OR OTHER BANKS OR SOUTHERN WEALTH ONCE SEAN KINGSBURY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NOW LET'S TURN OUR THOUGHTS TO THE MARKET A LITTLE BIT MORE STABLE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THE QUESTION IS WHY WHAT'S CHANGED BELOW NEIL CAN TELL US HE'S WITH US HERE IN THE STUDIO HE'S HEAD OF THE U.K. INVESTMENT OFFICE OF U.B.S. WEALTH MANAGEMENT BILL THOUGHTS
I THINK WE IT BUT BACK ROW ON IT IT'S SOME STABILITY AROUND THE OIL PRICE WERE ALSO SEEN SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOU THINK NEWS AND IT'S NOT GETTING WORSE AROUND CHINA WE'VE HAD SOME BETTER SIGNALS THEY'RE IN THE HOUSING MARKET THINGS LIKE LENDING
AND OF COURSE I THINK THE STORY HERE IS AT THE MARKET AND OVERPRICED FOR RECEPTION RISK BY THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY AND IT'S OFTEN THROUGH PARTICULAR GIVEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE HOUSE WOULD SECTOR BOTH IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES SUPPORTED BY LOW ENERGY BROUGHT US AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE FROM THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR TODAY
YES AND THE SERVICES SECTOR I THINK THE SERVICE MATCH AS IMPORTANT AS THE U.K. CENTRE POLITICAL PICKING UP ANY BRICKS AND EFFECTS WITH THEM THE BANK THE BANK OF ENGLAND WERE ALL TO BE FOCUSED ON THAT FUTURE EXPECTATION SERIES WHICH IS QUITE WEAK AT THE MOMENT TO THOSE LEVELS IN THREE YEARS I DON'T SEE THAT ACTUALLY IF THAT'S THE TWO RATING FOR THAT THAT WOULD BE A CONCERN TO THEM TURNING OFF ONCE AGAIN MY MATERNITY BREAKS IT DO YOU THINK THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND
HE'S TAKING MORE OF ALL WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE TO RAISING INTEREST RATES BECAUSE YES I THINK CLEARLY I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE INTEREST RATES GOING UP THE HEAD OF THE REFERENDUM ITSELF AT THE BANK AMONGST OTHER THINGS IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT ON SENTIMENT BOLT THOSE FACING THE OVERSEAS MARKETS PUT ALTON AGAIN THERE WAS GOING TO THE SERVICES SECTOR OUR SENSES THAT THEY WAIT TILL THE END OF THE YEAR
IT'LL BE THE END OF THE YEAR BEFORE THEY MOVE SO BE GIVEN THE LOOK VERY LOW INFLATION NO THAT WAS WHAT I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH TO THE END OF THE YEAR REALLY ALMOST BRIEF MENTION OF THE JOBS PICTURE IN THE U.S. THAT OF COURSE IS VERY CENTRAL TO THE WAY THAT THE CENTRAL BANK LINKS YES WE'VE HAD A VERY SOLID PERFORMANCE EITHER WAY IT'S NOT THAT BOTHERED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE PRIMARY WELL I MEAN I THINK I THINK THE KEY THING IS THIS HALL CALLED STORY AROUND THE STRENGTH OF THE CONSUMER
IS VERY MUCH TO THE JOBS MARKET AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN THE ORDER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNEMPLOYED GREAT FALLING BACK BUT THE OTHER KEY STORY HERE AS WE PUT OUR WAGES AGAIN IF THERE IS EVIDENCE WHICH PRESSURE'S BUILDING THE CENTRAL BANK IN THE U.S. WILL RESPOND AGAIN THAT'LL UPSET THE MARK POSSIBLY WE DON'T EXPECT TO MOVE AND RATES IN THE U.S. AGAIN UPWARDS OF COURSE TO SEPTEMBER MILADY AW THANK YOU VERY MUCH

THEY SAY THAT FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY ARE KEY TO THEIR LONG TERM SUCCESS AND THE CONSTANT DIET OF UNNECESSARY REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY BRUSSELS IS A HINDRANCE THE SENTIMENTS ARE ECHOED BY THE EMPLOYMENT MINISTER PRETTY PATEL WHO SAYS IN TODAY'S TIMES THAT ENTREPRENEURS ARE INCREASINGLY SUFFOCATED BY E.U. RULES
PROSECUTORS IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE BEING TOLD THEY SHOULD CONSIDER CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST PEOPLE WHO SET UP FAKE SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILE'S THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE HAS TOUGHER ACTION IS REQUIRED AGAINST PEOPLE WHO USE THESE PROFILES TO HARASS OR EMBARRASS OTHERS
NORTH KOREA HAS FIRED SEVERAL SHORT RANGE PROJECTILES INTO THE SEA THE WEAPONS WERE SET OFF OURS AFTER THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO IMPOSE NEW SANCTIONS ON PYONGYANG

A VICTORIAN GASOMETER WHICH STANDS NEXT TO THE OVAL CRICKET GROUND IN SOUTH LONDON HAS BEEN GIVEN PROTECTED STATUS GAS HOLDER NUMBER ONE WAS THE WORLD'S LARGEST WHEN IT WAS CONSTRUCTED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN IT HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH DEMOLITION BUT WAS NOW BEING GRADE TWO LISTED BY HISTORIC
THANK YOU CHRIS IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW THAT ARGUMENT ABOUT WHETHER MIGRANT CAMPS MIGHT MOVE FROM CALAIS TO KENT IT BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE YOU MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE FAMILIAR WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN TODAY WELL BECAUSE THE FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER HAS TOLD THE F.T. THAT IT WILL
HAPPEN YOU SPEAKING IN ADVANCE OF A SUMMIT BETWEEN DAVID CAMERON AND OTHER BRITISH MINISTERS AND THE FRENCH PRESIDENT AND OTHER MINISTERS FROM PARIS THAT SUMMIT TAKES PLACE IN AMIL AND OUR CORRESPONDENT BEN RIGHT IS THERE A SINS BEN THESE COMMENTS ARE BEING ORCHESTRATED TO BE HELPFUL TO DAVID CAMERON
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THERE WASN'T A DEGREE OF CO ORDINATION GOING ON BETWEEN PARIS AND LONDON AHEAD OF THIS VISIT TODAY AND IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE OF COURSE IF MY COMMENTS ARE ECHOED BY THE FRENCH PRESIDENT LATER BECAUSE OF COURSE IT TOUCHES ON ONE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE ISSUES ALREADY AT THE HEART OF THIS REFERENDUM DEBATE THE ISSUE AROUND FREE MOVEMENT AND MIGRATION CAMPS IN THE NORTH OF FRANCE JUST LIKE THE JUNGLE IT'S OF COURSE IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A BI LATERAL DEAL THAT ENABLES
BRITAIN TO HAVE PASSPORT CHECKS IN CALAIS FRENCH HAVE SIMILAR IN DOVER THE LAST NIGHT DAVID CAMERON DENIED HE WAS SCAREMONGERING WHEN HE CLAIMED THE MIGRANT CAMPS LIKE THE JUNGLE WHICH OF COURSE HAS NOW BEEN DEMOLISHED COULD
MOVED TO FRANCE IF BRITAIN LEFT THE E.U. SO THEY'LL BE THRILLED I THINK BY THESE COMMENTS BY EMMANUEL MACRO THAT SUGGESTS THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN IF BRITAIN LEFT THE E.U. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE FULL INTERVIEW WE DON'T KNOW THE CONTEXT ALL WE HAVE IS A SHORT QUOTE IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES FROM MY MACKEREL IN WHICH HE SAYS THE DAY THIS RELATIONSHIP UNRAVELS MIGRANTS WILL NO LONGER BE IN CALAIS
IT'S STRIKING ISN'T IT THAT IN ALL OF THESE ARGUMENTS YOU OFTEN HEAR LISTENERS SAYING GIVE US THE FACTS WHAT IS THE TRUTH SO MANY OF THEM ARE BASED ON JUDGEMENTS ON PREDICTIONS ON POLITICIANS SAY WHAT THEY MIGHT DO IN CERTAIN UNPREDICTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
AND CLEARLY THAT APPLIES MORE THAN EVER TO THE ARGUMENT AROUND WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE IN JUNE AND THE GOVERNMENT AS WE KNOW HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT
THE REALITY OF PULLING OUT OF THE E.U. THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WILL HAVE THE TRADE FOR THINGS LIKE
MIGRATION CAMP IN NORTHERN FRANCE AND IT'S DIFFICULT I THINK FOR THE LEAD CAMPAIGN TO COUNTER SOME OF THE ASSERTIONS BEING MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE LEFT BEING PRESS FOR WHAT WHAT'S IT WHAT WOULD YOU DO WHAT WOULD BE THE TRADE AGREEMENTS IN THE MIGRATION AGREEMENTS AND SO ON THAT YOU WERE YOU WOULD PUT IN PLACE AND I THINK DAVID CAMERON IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO CALL UPON EUROPEAN LEADERS OVER THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS
TO REALLY BACK UP THE ARGUMENTS BEING MADE BY THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN AND WE MAY WELL HEAR QUITE A LOT OF THAT FROM PRESIDENT ON TODAY ON THE ISSUE OF WHAT SORT OF ACCESS MIGHT BRITAIN HAVE POST BREAKS IT TO THE SINGLE MARKET WHAT WOUND WOULD BE ATTACHED OF COURSE THE REALITY OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE AFTERMATH
HAVE A VOTE TO LEAVE COULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT AND THE THINKING COULD CHANGE DRAMATICALLY THANK YOU THIS BUT
YEAH SORRY BEN TO GET YOU OFF THERE WHICH IS REALLY A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF TIME TO GET YOUR MID SENTENCE BEN RIGHT THERE IN A MEAL WITH HIM A LOT MORE FROM YOUR READY FOR LATER IN THE DAY TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN SETTING UP A FAKE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT AND USING IT TO THREATEN OR HARASS SOMEONE COULD RESULT IN CRIMINAL CHARGES THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE IS CONSULTING ON NEW GUIDELINES TOM SIMON'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE AND IF THESE GUIDELINES BECOME THE LORD TOM HOW WOULD THEY WERE
THE GUIDELINES TO PROSECUTORS SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY USING EXISTING LAWS TO CONSIDER WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE PROSECUTIONS AND EFFECTIVELY THIS IS THE C.P.S. IN ITS GRADUAL PROCESS OF UPDATING THE GUIDELINES BY WHICH IT'S PROSECUTORS WORK BUT EFFECTIVELY WHAT THE C.P.S. IS SAYING IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL CATEGORIES UNDER WHICH THE USE OF FAKE MEDIA SITES CAN BE REGARDED AS ILLEGAL
OF THE MOST SERIOUS END WHEN THEIR USE RESULTS IN A CREDIBLE THREAT TO AN INDIVIDUAL THAT'S A THREAT TO KILL OR TO HARM BUT AND THEN RANGING DOWN THROUGH FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF WHAT'S CALLED REVENGE PORN SO POSTING INTIMATE PICTURES OF SOMEBODY AFTER A RELATIONSHIP'S ENDED OR HARASSMENTS OR STALKING
AND AT THE BOTTOM END IT CAN BE AS LITTLE AS SAYING SOMETHING FALLS ON LINE BUT THE C.P.S. SAYS THE PROSECUTOR'S VERY MUCH HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S A THREAT TO THEIR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO PROSECUTE BUT WOULD THE EFFECT OF OF ALL OF THIS IN BROAD TERMS BE THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO PROSECUTE ON THE BASIS OF AN ONLINE CRIME
YES BECAUSE I THINK THE PROBLEM FOR PROSECUTORS IS THEY'RE CHANGING AT THE WAY IN WHICH THEY THINK ABOUT HOW PROSECUTIONS HAPPEN AND THIS TO TEST THERE HAS TO BE A TEST OF WHETHER THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE BUT ALSO A TEST OF WHETHER THERE'S A PROSECUTION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND THE CHANGE IS NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH WE ARE CHANGING OUR LIVES BY LEADING THOSE LIVES
INCREASINGLY ON THE INTERNET SO IF FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE MORE SCENARIOS UNDER WHICH SOMEBODY CAN BE PROSECUTED AND IT'S MORE LIKELY THOSE PROSECUTIONS WILL HAPPEN AND THE RANGE OF OFFENCES THAT HE'S INVOLVED IN THESE GUIDELINES WILL BE APPLIED AND WITH WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME SERIOUS SENTENCES IN THE MALICIOUS COMMUNICATIONS ACT WHICH IS ONE OF THE ACTS WHICH COULD RESULT IN PROSECUTIONS
IS UP TO TWO YEARS AND THAT'S FOR QUITE LOW LEVELS OF HARM BEING CAUSED I THINK THE C.P.S. IS SAYING IS GETTING TO GRIPS WITH OUR MODERN LIVES IN CONSIDERING CHANGES TO THESE GUIDELINES WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS ALISON SAUNDERS AT HALF PAST SEVEN TOM SIMON THANK YOU
IT IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN O'CLOCK NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN FIRING SHORT RANGE MISSILES INTO THE SEA APPARENTLY THE POINTER THE SEEMINGLY POINTLESS GESTURE TO PROTEST AGAINST THE LATEST SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON THE COUNTRY BY THE UNITED NATIONS A CORRESPONDENT STEVE EVANS JOINS US FROM THE BORDER WITH NORTH KOREA HE IS OF COURSE ON THE SOUTH KOREAN SIDE MORNING TUESDAY
MORNING THERE CLIMB ON THE CONFLUENCE OF THE ENGINE AND THE HAN RIVER OH LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE WATER IN NORTH KOREA AN OBSERVATION POST JUST HERE
AN OBSERVATION POST JUST THERE THEY LOOK BINOCULAR TO BID UP TO BINOCULAR AT EACH OTHER ON BOTH SIDES OF THE WATER ANALYSING THOSE SANCTIONS SIX MISSILES FROM THE NORTHERN SIDE
WITH DEFIANCE AND ANGER I THINK IS THE BEST WAY OF READING AT LEGAL MISSILES COS THEY WERE SHORT RANGE THE GOVERNMENT ON THIS SIDE IS CLEARLY PLEASED WITH TOUGH TOUGHER SANCTIONS BUT THERE IS ALSO A DEBATE IN SOUTH KOREA ABOUT WHETHER SANCTIONS ARE THE RIGHT WAY OF DOING THINGS CARROTS AND STICKS
SOUTH KOREA OF COURSE HE'S ALREADY TOUGHENED IT SANCTIONS ARE HOLDING A JOINT VENTURE WITH A NORTH VERY NEAR HERE AN INDUSTRIAL ZONE IN NORTH KOREA WHERE SOUTH KOREAN COMPANIES OPERATED
ONE OF THE COMPANIES THERE WAS JIM GLIDERS AND ITS FOUNDER SONG GINS JOCK TOLD ME HIS NORTH KOREAN WORKERS CHANGED RADICALLY WITH CONTACT IN THAT'S THE POINT WITH HIS SOUTHERN COMPANY HERE HE REMEMBERED WHEN HE FIRST MET THEM
THE FIRST IMPRESSION WAS FAIRLY GOOD PEOPLE THAT'S REALLY SMELL
OH IT'S OLDER PEOPLE AND BODY CHEF WAS REALLY NEVER RELEASE STRAIGHT UP THE FINGER MAY WAS REALLY BAD
HE SAID HIS SOIL COMING FROM THE LET GO
GUTES SHALL WOULD BIG BATHROOMS AND ALSO WE PUT TO HUGHES A NUNNERY

WHAT'S THE CHANGE YOU NOTICED AND PEOPLE THE BIGGEST CHANGES FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE SCHEME'S MUCH WHITE
AND THEY'RE QUITE HEALTHY LOOKING
THEY MORE SMILE THERE'S A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER YOU SHOULD BE TOUGHER
PUNISH NORTH CAREER SANCTIONS OR WHETHER YOU SHOULD ENGAGE WITH
WHAT'S YOUR VIEW AND AGAINST FOR SURE I DO MANY THINGS YOU KNOW NUCLEAR WEAPONS HERE AROUND IN THESE THINGS
BUT IN A HUMAN SIDES I'M QUITE HAPPY TO SEE THEM
DO YOU FEEL BAD CHANGING YOU SEE THEM CHANGE YOU KNOW THE THINKING IN MY MIND THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAVE ALL THE INFORMATION GOING INTO CHANGING THEIR MINDS STEVE JUST TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT THE DETAIL OF THE SANCTIONS THAT HE THINKS ARE CHANGING MINDS
WHERE THEY RECKON SANCTIONS WILL CHANGE THE SITUATION IS WITH MORE INSPECTIONS OF CARGO OR NORTH KOREAN CARGO IN AND OUT
WE'LL HAVE TO BE INSPECTED IF IT GOES THROUGH A THIRD PORT OR EAR
THEY THINK THAT WAS SLOW UP THE PROCESS AND ACTUALLY AFFECT THE NORTH KOREAN ECONOMY
ONE OF THE LUPO'S PEOPLE ARE IDENTIFYING THOUGH IS COAL EXPORTS FROM NORTH KOREA AND IT'S A BIG EARNER FOR THEM A BAND IF THAT MONEY GOES TO THE NUCLEAR PROGRAMME AND PEOPLE HERE ARE SAYING HOW ON EARTH CAN YOU TELL
THE ARMY OWNS A LOT OF COAL ENTERPRISES PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IT'S GOING THE ARMY'S GOING TO THE NUCLEAR PROGRAMME WHILE ALL THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE GOT TO DO IS CHANGE THE OWNERSHIP OF THE ARMY TO LET'S SAY A LOCAL COUNCIL JUST OVER THE WATER
STEVE EVANS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE RESULTS OF AMERICA'S SUPER TUESDAY VOTES ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT MEENA DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY IS SUDDENLY A SERIOUS PROSPECT IT SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION IS NOT SEWN UP HIS FIGHT NOW IS NOT AGAINST INDIVIDUAL RIVALS BUT AGAINST THE PARTY ESTABLISHMENT WHICH DISLIKES HIM NEVER HAS THE GULF BETWEEN A PARTY ELITE AND ITS GRASSROOTS BEEN GREATER SAYS THE PAPER
THE TIMES SAYS MISTER TRUMP AS AGAIN DE FUNNY POLITICAL GRAVITY WHAT'S THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAS SENIOR REPUBLICANS HAVE RESPONDED TO HIS SUCCESS IN THE PRIMARIES BY WRITING OPEN LETTER DETAILING THEIR OBJECTIONS TO HIM THE GUARDIAN'S GARY YOUNG SAYS THE PARTY'S HANDLE DONALD TRUMP LIKE AN INDULGENT PARENT DEALING WITH A POORLY BEHAVED CHILD WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE SET SOME FIRM BOUNDARIES NOW HE SAYS

WILL ANGER OUT CAMPAIGNERS IT SAYS THEY WILL ASK WHY A GERMAN MULTINATIONAL IS WADING INTO THE DEBATE ABOUT BRITAIN'S FUTURE THE FIRM INSISTED IT WAS RESPONDING TO REQUESTS FROM STAFF FOR THE PAPERS ARGUING LOUDLY ABOUT WHO WAS MISLEADING AND SCARING HIM THE SON CARRIES AN ARTICLE BY BORIS JOHNSON ACCUSING DAVID CAMERON OF CLUTCHING THE SKIRTS OF EUROPE
AND SAYS HIS LATEST INTERVENTION WILL DEEPEN THE SPIRALLING FEUD WITH HIS LONG TERM RIVAL EVENT USES AN EDITORIAL TO LAMENT THAT FAX WILL PLAY LITTLE PART IN EITHER SIDE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE THE DAILY MAIL DISMISSES THE ARGUMENTS PUT OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY ABOUT THE RISKS OF LEAVING SAYING PROJECT FEAR HAS UPGRADED TO WHAT IT CALLS PROJECT HYSTERIA
A CARTOON IN THE TELEGRAPH COMBINES THE STORY WITH THE ROW ABOUT BANNING TACKLING IN SCHOOL RUGBY MATCHES IT CHOOSE LEADING CONSERVATIVES AS PLAYERS CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE DAVID CAMERON PIPES UP OH I THOUGHT WE SAID NO JACK
THE TIMES CLAIMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS READY TO PULL THE PLUG ON THE NATIONAL GRID AND PUT THE ENERGY REGULATOR OFGEM IN CHARGE OF MANAGING THE U.K.'S ELECTRICITY SUPPLY IT SAYS THE OPTION BEING CONSIDERED IN WHITEHALL TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THE GRID HAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AS OWNER AND OPERATOR OF THE NETWORK AND BECAUSE OF A GROWING RELIANCE ON IMPORTED ELECTRICITY SEVERAL PAPERS REPORT THE INDEPENDENT DESCRIBED AS POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE ART WORLD'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL
BORDER WARS THE NEW DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY GALLERY GABRIELLE FINN ALBIE HAS HINTED HE WANTS TO ALTER THE AGREEMENT CONCENTRATE ON HORSE FROM BEFORE NINETEEN HUNDRED WHAT'S THE TATE GALLERY FOCUSES ON MODERN WORK THE TELEGRAPH SAYS HE'S DESCRIBED THE RESTRICTION AS FRUSTRATING AND HE WAS THINKING MOVING TOWARDS THE SECOND WORLD WAR
THE NATIONAL GALLERY GIVES A STATEMENT TO THE TIMES SAYING THE AGREEMENT WAS NEVER MEANT TO IMPOSE A STRICT DATE AND THE CUT OFF WOULD REMAIN CIRCA NINETEEN HUNDRED THE PAPER SAYS THE STATEMENT DIDN'T ELABORATE AND WHETHER THE NINETEEN THIRTIES MIGHT REASONABLY BE DESCRIBED AS CIRCA NINETEEN HUNDRED
THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN OUR MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING A FRENCH GOVERNMENT MINISTER HAS WARNED THAT MIGRANTS COULD TRAVEL UNCHECKED TO BRITAIN IF U.K. VOTERS CHOOSE TO LEAVE THE E.U. NOW THE PROSPECTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ON M.P.S' MINDS YESTERDAY JEREMY CORBIN WAS WORRIED THAT SOME OF THEM WERE MISSING OUT ON FREE EARLY EDUCATION AND AT THE OTHER END OF THE SCALE THERE WAS CONCERN THAT THAT HAVE TO WORK UNTIL THEY'RE SEVENTIES BEFORE GETTING A STATE PENSION
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN BETWEEN HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HERE
UP IN THE GALLERY RESERVED FOR M.P.S GUESTS AND FAMILIES ARE VERY SMALL GIRL HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN TO WATCH PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS AS SHE PERCHED ON THE KNEE OF HER RESPONSIBLE ADULT JEREMY CORBIN'S QUESTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN AIMED RIGHT AT HER
ONE THIRD OF FAMILIES PROMISED THIRTY HOURS' FREE CHILDCARE NOW WON'T RECEIVE IT THIS IS A BROKEN PROMISE AS THE VERY SMALL GUEST UP IN THE GALLERY SUCH THOUGHTFULLY ON HER NECKLACE JEREMY KORBEN CONTINUED
MANY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS ARE NOT OFFERING THE NEW ENTITLEMENT DUE TO INSUFFICIENT FUNDS
THERE ARE FORTY ONE THOUSAND THREE YEAR OLDS MISSING OUT ON FREE EARLY EDUCATION AS A RESULT OF THIS WE WERE PROMISED INTERVENE AND ENSURE THOSE CHILDREN GET THEIR START IN LIFE THAT THEY DESERVE
GAZING UP AT THE BIG LIGHTS IN THE CHAMBER AT THE VERY SMALL GIRL SEEMED HOWEVER ARE MOVED BY THAT AWED BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S REPLY WHEN HE EXPLAINED THERE WILL BE SOME PILOT SCHEMES THIS YEAR AND FULL IMPLEMENTATION NEXT YEAR WHICH IS IN LINE WITH WHAT WE SAID IN OUR MANIFESTO BUT I'M DELIGHTED HE IS HELPING ME TO PROMOTE ITS GOVERNMENT
WHEN I BECAME PRIME MINISTER I THINK WE ONLY HAD TEN HOURS OF CHILD CARE AND IT'S GONE UP TO TWELVE AND UNDER FIFTEEN AND NOW TO THIRTY
IT'S PROBABLY JUST AS WELL THAT THE VERY SMALL GUEST LEFT SHORTLY AFTER THAT TO GO UPSTAIRS FOR SOME LUNCH AND POSSIBLY A MUCH NEEDED NAP BECAUSE WHAT CAME NEXT COULD BE ALARMING FOR THE VERY YOUNG
M.P.S MOVED ON TO REPORTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ORDERED A FURTHER REVIEW INTO THE STATE PENSION AGE EXPERTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT PEOPLE JOINING THE WORKFORCE COULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE MID SEVENTIES BEFORE THEY CAN RETIRE LABOUR SPOKESMAN OMEN SMITH DREADED TO THINK WHAT THAT COULD MEAN FOR TODAY'S TODDLERS
IS IT SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX SEVENTY SEVEN IS IT EIGHTY AS HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE THE BENCHES MINISTER WORN TODAY ISN'T IT THE TRUTH
MISTER SPEAKER THAT THEIR NEW PENSION PROMISE IT'S NOT A SEVENTY FIVE P. THEY'RE ALWAYS BANGING ON ABOUT IT'S THE SEVERED D. FIVE USES YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK AND WAIT UNDER THIS TORY GOVERNMENT BEFORE YOU GET THE STATE PENSION
BUT THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH SAID RISING LIFE EXPECTANCY MEANT MINISTERS HAD TO ENSURE A PENSIONS WERE SUSTAINABLE FOR THE FUTURE HE ACCUSED DORMAN SMITH OF UTTER IDIOCY AND HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE HOUSE THAT I THINK SADLY HE GIVES A BAD REPUTATION TO SHALLOW PEOPLE THAT WAS SO PATHETIC AS A RESPONSE TO A YOU Q.
IT WAS OURS FROM AN OPPOSITION THAT HAS NO POLICY JUMPS AROUND OPPOSING EVERYTHING BRAGGING UP SPENDING COMMITMENTS NO WONDER THEY HAVEN'T A HOPE IN HELL OF BEING IN GOVERNMENT
AS IT HAPPENED TO FORMER MINISTERS WHO HAVE BOTH MOVED ON TO DO SOME DEEP THINKING ABOUT THE PENSIONS ISSUE WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FAIRNESS BETWEEN GENERATIONS WITH A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S THE FORMER LIB DEM PENSIONS MINISTER STEVE WEBB SUMMED UP HAVE A LOT OF US ARE FEELING I THINK WHEN PEOPLE SEE HEADLINE SAYING YOU HAVE TO WORK TODAY EIGHTY ONE OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY JUST GET UNDER THE DUVET AND THE GIVER
BUT DON'T DO THAT ACT THE MORAL OF THAT STORY FOR ME IS NOT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD WILL WORK TO SEVENTY SEVEN IS THAT THE ANTIDOTE TO WORK TILL YOU DROP HIS SAVE MORE
A FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTER LORD WILLETTS ADMITTED THAT SOME OF THE EXPECTATIONS FOR A GOOD LIFE IN BRITAIN WERE GETTING HARDER TO ACHIEVE OWNING YOUR OWN HOME SETTLING
BILLY ARE FUNDED PENSION
THOSE THINGS WHICH WERE PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATIC MASSIVE POLICY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES AND I THINK IN THE LONG RUN A SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING INTO THEIR THIRTIES ARE OLDER AND DON'T
IS ONE WHERE THE YOUNGER GENERATION WILL HAVE JUST LESS COMMITMENT FEEL LESS ENGAGED FEEL THAT THEN THEY'RE GETTING A ROADIE
BUT STEVE WEBB ARGUED THAT LIFE'S ALWAYS BEEN TOUGH THE SIXTY YEAR OLD WAS PROBABLY TWENTY WHEN WE HAD HYPERINFLATION IN THE MID SEVENTIES THIRTY WHEN WE HAD MASS UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE EIGHTIES YOU KNOW IF SHE'S A WOMAN SHE MAY WELL HAVE STARTED WORK AT A TIME WHEN THERE WASN'T EVEN LEGISLATION TO STOP DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN LABOUR MARKET
BUT AS ONE M.P. POINTED OUT THERE WAS A STARK FACTS OF POLITICS THAT MEANS OLDER PEOPLE DO TEND TO GET A BETTER DEAL
OLDER PEOPLE FAULT DAVID WILLETTS THOUGHT THE YOUNG HAD BEEN BADLY ADVISED THE WORST ADVISE YOUNG PEOPLE EVER GOT WAS RUSSELL BRAND TELLING THEM DON'T VOTE
SO IF YOU'RE UNDER THIRTY AND UNDER THE DUVET TAKE KNELT SUSAN YOU MAYOR REPORTING ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AND AS EVER YOU CAN HEAR MORE AT EIGHT THIRTY ON THE RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND ONDIGITAL
THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN A SENIOR GREEK POLICE OFFICER GUARDING A MIGRANT CAMP ON THE BORDER WITH MACEDONIA SAYS HIS FORCES OVERWORKED SHORT OF RESOURCES AND DESPERATE MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ARE IN THE CAMP FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER IT WAS DESIGNED FOR AND THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTS AS THEY TRY TO CROSS THE BORDER A EUROPE REPORTER GAVIN LEE HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO THE OFFICER CHRISTOS ADAM
RENTAL IS ONE OF THIS BIRD THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ALL OF US THERE IF IT IS AS WELL
WE DON'T COVER THAT HIS HORSES KNOW ANYTHING MORE FROM THIS WAS THE HARDEST PART OF YOUR JOB
AND THERE'S A BORDER AND THEY'LL UNDERGO EVERYBODY BOUGHT
BECAUSE BABIES FOR THE VERB THE DUNKER OR YOU PLUS THE CASTLE
BABY'S GONE FAMILY'S DRUNKEN WOMAN
I DON'T LIKE ALL THE LOVE AND THE ONES THEY'VE GONE
WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR EUROPEAN LEADER SAYING GREECE CANNOT COPE FOR MUCH LONGER AS IT WAS A CUSTOMER HUMANITARIAN DISASTER ACCORDING TO THE U.N. BEING HERE DOES IT FEEL LIKE THAT
IT'S MORE IT'S MORE FROM THESE IS THEY SAY ON THE REAR OF THE YEAR THEY'LL SAY ANYTHING THEY WANT WHEN YOU CAME TO SEE YOU COME ALONG EYES UNDERSTAND WHAT'S
ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DEALING WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAVE I'VE MET OFFICERS ON ELSEWHERE ON THE MIGRANT ROUTES IN EUROPE IN THE BALKANS FOR EXAMPLE WHO WERE SO THEY WERE BEING TREATED FOR P.T.S.D. BECAUSE OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THIS DAY IN DAY OUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS YOU THAT MAKES YOU THINK
THEIR FACES THEY MICE THE MAKES ONE HUG PEOPLE HUNT PEOPLE WE DON'T DO ONE COULD BE ABOUT THE WOODCUTTER
THIS IS IN THERE WE GO THEN HERE WE GO BUT ONE WANTS TO SEE THAT ONE
THE MISERY IS PEOPLE HAVE I THINK ALL THE EUROPA IS BLACK
I THINK IT WILL STOP THE IS THERE TO STOP THE THAT WARREN CEREAL
CHRISTOS A DAM IS A GREEK POLICE OFFICER SPEAKING TO OUR REPORTER GAVIN LEON THE MACEDONIAN BORDER SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WHAT WE USED TO CALL LEGAL HIGHS WILL SOON BE LEGAL NO LONGER AS A NEW LAW COMES INTO FORCE IN APRIL TO BAN PRODUCING SELLING OR BUNNY THING SO CALLED PSYCHO ACTIVE SUBSTANCES BUT THE POLICE STILL FACED THE CHALLENGE OF FINDING OUT
WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN DRUGS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY BEING CHANGED AND CONSTANTLY BEING REFINED SCIENTISTS ARE QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST BELIEVE THEY MAY HAVE FOUND A WAY TO HELP JOHNNY ON THE LINE FROM THERE PROFESSOR STEPHEN BELL FROM THE QUEEN SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY AND CHEMICAL ENGINEERING MORNING TO YOU PROFESSOR BELL AND WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT THE EXACT COMPOSITION OF ANY DRUG
WELL I GUESS THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THAT OF COURSE IS THE SIMPLE CRIMINAL ASPECT OF THE OF THE WHOLE THING IF YOU PROSECUTE SOMEONE FOR HER
POSSESSING SUBSTANCE UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IT IS MORE BROADLY IT'S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT ACTUALLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE ALREADY KNOWN TO BE HARMFUL AND AS NEW VARIANTS APPEAR DOUBTLESS NEW VARIANTS WHICH ARE ALSO HARMFUL WILL HAVE TO COME ONTO THE MARKET WE NEED TO KNOW WHICH ONES THEY ARE TOOK QUEEN'S BELFAST WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT TO DO
WHAT WHEN MY LAB SPECIALISES IN USING LATER LIKE SCATTERING TO RECORD BASICALLY THE CHEMICAL SIGNATURES OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS BUT LOOKING AT THE WAY THE MOLECULES VIBRATE WHILE WE GET OUR FINGER PRINTS OF EACH
DISTINCT CHEMICAL COMPOUND IT'S VERY RAPID SO BASICALLY YOU CAN SHOW ME LATER ON OUR SAMPLE GET THIS CHEMICAL SIGNATURE BACK THAT TELLS US WHETHER THAT ONE WE'VE SEEN BEFORE BECAUSE WE CAN MATTED WITH ONE WE'VE SEEN PREVIOUSLY AND THAT THERE ARE ALSO THEREFORE WHETHER CHOMPALOT
OR A TELLS US IT'S A NEW ONE AND THEN PUT A NEW ONE THEN WE CAN USE ALL THE RESOURCES WE HAVE AVAILABLE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO IDENTIFY THIS NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUND AND THEN START TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT AND THE ADVANTAGE FOR THE POLICE THE ADVANTAGE THE AUTHORITIES IS
NARROWING IN THE TIME IN THE WINDOW IF YOU LIKE IN ORDER TO GET AHEAD OF THE DRUG PRODUCERS IS THAT RIGHT ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S WHERE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ALONGSIDE FRENCH ACCENT TO NORTHERN IRELAND TO TRY AND GET THE THE TIMESCALE PRODUCED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE NOT BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF THE PRODUCERS BECAUSE
THERE ARE SO MANY POTENTIAL NEW VARIANTS WE REALLY CAN'T PREDICT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO NEXT BUT WE CAN AT LEAST TRY TO KEEP UP WITH THEM
WE NEED TO BE WE NEED TO GET THE INFORMATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IF YOU HELPFUL VARIANCE COME OUT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT
QUICKLY SERVANT GET WARNINGS OUT QUICKLY YOU TALK OF AARON'S GIVES AN IDEA OF THE SCALE OF THIS HOW MANY OF THESE DIFFERENT LEGAL HIGHS AS THEY'RE CALLED WELL THERE ARE THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED ALREADY AND CIRCULATION WITHIN TWENTY FOURTEEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YOU VARIANTS WERE REPORTED IN EUROPE IN JUST THAT SINGLE YEAR SO THESE ARE HUNDREDS OF DISTINCT CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THAT ARE COMING ONTO THE MARKET AND PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING
AND THERE IS A CHANCE NOW THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THESE FOR THE POLICE AND WHAT DAYS
THE ACTUAL IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES IS MUCH FASTER THAN THAT IT IT'S MINUTES OF COURSE IS ALWAYS OVERHEAD TIME WITH THEM YOU CAN TAKE THE MEASUREMENT BUT THEN YOU'D THERE'S ALL KINDS OF BACKGROUND WORK THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IT TO FORENSIC SAMPLE PROFESSOR STEPHEN BELL AT QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S OVER
IT'S A COMING UP TO THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND PHILIP AVERY'S JOINED US WITH THE WEATHER FORECAST MORNING PHIL I'M SURE VERY GOOD MONTY LET'S START THE DAY'S FORECAST FOR THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WALES AND THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND SOME SHOWERY BURSTS OF RAIN AROUND AT THE MOMENT NOT AMOUNTING TO VERY MUCH AND THESE WILL TEND TO FADE AND THEN YOU GET A CHANCE OF SOME SUNSHINE AROUND ABOUT THE MIDDLE PART OF THE EARLY PART OF THE AFTERNOON CHERISH IT IF YOU WILL BECAUSE IT WON'T LAST THERE'S A NEW AREA OF CLOUD AND RAIN WHICH WILL BE INTO THE WEST OF CORNWALL BY AROUND MID AFTERNOON INTO THE WEST OF WALES BY AROUND TEATIME
AND INTO THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND JUST AFTER DARK TEMPERATURES AROUND ABOUT SORT OF EIGHT NINE IF YOU'RE LUCKY FURTHER EASTERN ENGLAND THERE ARE ONE OR TWO SHOWERS WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT ACROSS EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST THESE AGAIN WILL FADE A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE AROUND I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
AND THERE MAY MAYBE JUST ONE OR TWO OF THOSE SHOWERS JUST CREEPING IN FROM THE WEST TO FINISH OFF THE AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES AT BEST AROUND ABOUT TEN DEGREES OR SO FOR MANY SINGLE FIGURES WILL DO IT FOR NORTHERN IRELAND JUST ABOUT DRY EVERYWHERE ONE OR TWO SHOWERS AROUND THIS MORNING AND THEN THE CLOUD FILLING IN THIS AFTERNOON SUCH THAT THE WESTERN PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND WILL SEE RAIN JUST AFTER LUNCH AND THEN IT'LL SPREAD TO ANTRIM AND DOWN IN THE LATTER PART OF THE AFTERNOON SOME ARE QUITE HEAVY AT TIMES PERHAPS AND THE TEMPERATURES SIX TO SEVEN
AND THEN TO SCOTLAND THE OVERNIGHT SHOWERS ARE STILL THERE JUST ABOUT TO BE HAD ACROSS NORTHERN AND EASTERN AREAS THESE WILL FADE AND THEN THERE WILL BE A DRIER INTERLUDE FOR MANY DURING THE COURSE OF THESE SORT OF LUNCH TIME PERIOD THE EARLY PART OF THE AFTERNOON JUST THICKENING THE CLOUD THOUGH ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF SCOTLAND TO FINISH OFF THE AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES HERE FIVE TO SEVEN
MY GREATEST CONCERNS OVERALL ARE FOR TONIGHT AND INTO TOMORROW MORNING'S COMMUTE WHERE A BAND OF CLOUD RAIN AND SNOW WILL AFFECT NORTHERN IRELAND THE SOUTH OF SCOTLAND THE FAR SOUTH OF SCOTLAND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND NORTH WALES AND THIS COULD DEPOSIT AROUND FIVE SOME SEND ME SCOTT HIGH GROUND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED PHIL LET'S TAKE A LOOK AHEAD TO TONIGHT AND SKETCHES ABOUT MODERN LIFE ON RADIO FOUR

GOOD MORNING IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE THIRD OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING A FRENCH GOVERNMENT MINISTER HAS SUGGESTED THE BRITISH BORDER CHECKS AT CALAIS COULD BECOME A THING OF THE PAST IF U.K. VOTERS CHOOSE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
NEW GUIDANCE TO PROSECUTORS IN ENGLAND AND WALES SO PEOPLE USE FAKE IDENTITIES ONLINE TO THREATEN PEOPLE SHOULD FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES NORTH KOREA HAS FIRED SEVERAL MISSILES INTO THE SEA IN RESPONSE TO TOUGH U.N. SANCTIONS THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THE FRENCH ECONOMY MINISTER EMMANNUELLE CRY HAS SUGGESTED THAT MIGRANTS COULD BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL UNCHECKED TO BRITAIN IF U.K. VOTERS CHOSE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION INDICATED THAT THE CURRENT AGREEMENT WHERE BRITISH BORDER CHECKS TAKE PLACE IN CALAIS COULD BE IN JEOPARDY AND ALSO WARN BRITAIN THAT IT SHOULD NOT EXPECT TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET
MY MACRO MADE THE COMMENTS AHEAD OF A MEETING TODAY BETWEEN DAVID CAMERON AND THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS LONG IN THE CITY OF THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON WHO'S CAMPAIGNING FOR AN OUTVOTE AS VOTERS TO IGNORE SCARE MONGERS FROM HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT THEN RIGHT
INTO THE ALREADY FEBRILE REFERENDUM DEBATE IN BRITAIN WALKS FRANCE MAKING IT CLEAR THERE'LL BE NO SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR THE U.K. IF IT VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U. IN JUNE
DOWNING STREET IS LIKELY TO WELCOME THIS WARNING FROM A MANUAL MACKEREL WHO TOLD THE FINANCIAL TIMES FRANCE COULD ENTER THE BILATERAL AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWS BRITISH BORDER CHECKS IN CALAIS IF THE U.K. WAS NO LONGER A MEMBER OF THE E.U. NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND MIGRANTS REMAIN STUCK THERE HOPING TO CROSS THE CHANNEL
MY MACRO AND ALSO SAID FRANCE WOULD ROLL OUT A RED CARPET TO LONDON'S BANKERS AND LIMIT ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET
THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WILL FRAME TALKS BETWEEN PRESIDENT DOLLOND AND DAVID CAMERON NATIONAL SECURITY IS NOW FREQUENTLY CITED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A VITAL REASON FOR REMAINING IN THE E.U. AND TODAY'S SUMMIT IS A CHANCE TO HAMMER THAT MESSAGE HOME
THE FOREIGN HOME AND DEFENCE SECRETARIES WILL MEET THEIR FRENCH COUNTERPARTS HERE TOO BUT LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAVE SAID FREE MOVEMENT RULES LEAVE BRITAIN MORE EXPOSED TO A PARIS STYLE ATTACK AND WRITING IN THEIR SON BORIS JOHNSON SAYS IGNORE THE SCARE MONGERS WE ARE BIGGER BETTER AND GREATER THAN THEY PRETEND
THE GERMAN CAR MANUFACTURER B.M.W. HAS WRITTEN TO ITS U.K. STAFF TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT IT SEES AS THE RISKS TO THE COMPANY FROM BRITAIN LEAVING THE E. U. B.M.W. WHICH OWNS MINNIE AND ROLLS ROYCE MOTORCARS TOLD EMPLOYEES IN AN EMAIL THAT THE BRITISH EXIT WOULD MEAN HIGHER COSTS PRICES AS A RESULT OF TARIFFS HERE'S OUR BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK
THE EMAIL FROM B.M.W. WARNS OF POTENTIAL THREATS TO THE COMPANY IN THE EVENT THE U.K. VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WHILE STRESSING IT'S ULTIMATELY A MATTER FOR THE BRITISH PUBLIC IT HIGHLIGHTS THE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT THE COMPANY DERIVES FROM THE EASY MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE E.U. AND SAYS THE EMPLOYMENT BASE OF THE COMPANY COULD BE AFFECTED
SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND BOARDS OF MANY COMPANIES HAVE ENDORSED IN OR OUT CAMPAIGNS AND WILL NO DOUBT CONTINUE TO DO SAME BUT THIS KIND OF COMMUNICATION DIRECTLY TO WORKERS WILL REIGNITE THE DEBATE STARTED IN THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM AS TO WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR COMPANIES WHICH DON'T HAVE A VOTE BUT DO HAVE A COMMERCIAL INTEREST TO GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN THINKS NOT AND DESCRIBED THE EMAIL OR SCAREMONGERING
THE BOSSES OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED SMALL COMPANIES HAVE SIGNED AN OPEN LETTER CALLING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. THEY SAY THAT FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY ARE KEY TO THEIR LONG TERM SUCCESS AND THE CONSTANT DIET OF UNNECESSARY REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY BRUSSELS IS A HINDRANCE
THE LETTER IS PUBLISHED BY THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WHICH SAYS SIGNATORIES RANGE FROM A COMPANY WITH ONE MEMBER OF STAFF TO ONE IN WHICH EMPLOYS FIFTEEN HUNDRED THE SENTIMENTS ARE ECHOED BY THE EMPLOYMENT MINISTER PRETTY PATEL WHO SAYS IN TODAY'S TIMES THAT ENTREPRENEURS ARE INCREASINGLY SUFFOCATED BY E.U. RULES
THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK IS VISITING GREECE AND TURKEY TODAY AS HE TRIES TO FORGE A UNIFIED EUROPE WIDE APPROACH TO THEIR MIGRATION CRISIS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ARE STUCK IN GREECE WITH BORDERS FURTHER NORTH NOW CLOSE TO THEM AND NEW ARRIVALS REACHED THE GREEK ISLANDS EVERY DAY A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS FROM THE ISLAND OF LESBOS
DONALD TUSK HAS BEEN TOURING CAPITAL CITIES IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE THIS WEEK TRYING TO EASE TENSIONS CAUSED BY THE MIGRATION CRISIS BUT NOTHING HE SAYS OR NOTHING THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES WILL MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE UNLESS THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ARRIVING ON THE GREEK ISLANDS STARTED TO FALL SIGNIFICANTLY
SO FAR THIS YEAR SOME SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY REACHED LES BOSS ALONE ON SMALL BOATS THAT SET OUT FROM THE TURKISH COAST SMUGGLING REMAINS A HUGELY LUCRATIVE BUSINESS AND THE DEMAND IS STILL HIGH
THAT'S WHY MY TUSKERS EMPHASISED THAT E.U. LEADERS MUST DO ALL THEY CAN TO SUMMIT NEXT MONDAY TO ENSURE THAT THEIR JOINT ACTION PLAN WITH TURKEY IS A SUCCESS THAT WILL DEPEND ABOVE ALL HE SAID IN A CLEAR AND SIGNIFICANT DROP IN ARRIVALS
IN REALITY THAT MEANS LESS THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE PER DAY GO TO THE KIND OF NUMBERS GREECE CAN WITH SOME HELP BEGIN TO COPE WITH FOR THE MOMENT THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS REMAINED STRANDED ON THE MACEDONIAN BORDER AND THOUSANDS MORE ARE SCATTERED AMONGST MAKESHIFT CAMPS IN ATHENS AND ELSEWHERE POLITICAL PROGRESS IS URGENTLY REQUIRED

NORTH KOREA HAS LAUNCHED SEVERAL SHORT RANGE MISSILES INTO THE SEA I WAS AFTER THE UNITED NATIONS ANNOUNCED TOUGH SANCTIONS AGAINST THE COUNTRY THE MEASURES WERE PASSED IN RESPONSE TO PYONGYANG W'S RECENT NUCLEAR TESTS STEVE EVANS REPORTS FROM SEOUL
THE FIRING WHICH DIDN'T THREATEN ANY TARGET OUTSIDE NORTH KOREA IS BEING SEEN IN SOUTH KOREA AS A GESTURE OF DEFIANCE ANNOYANCE AT THE PASSING OF THE VOTE FOR TOUGHER SANCTIONS AT THE UNITED NATIONS
NORTH KOREA'S MEDIA HAVE ALREADY MADE A FEROCIOUS VERBAL ATTACK ON SOUTH KOREA'S PRESIDENT CALLING HER A BAT WHICH LIVES IN A DINGY CARE
MANY NOW EXPECT ARE CRANKING UP OF TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IN THE WAKE OF THE UN RESOLUTION
THE SHORT RANGE MISSILES FIRED A PERMITTED UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT LONGER RANGE MISSILES WOULD NOT BE KNOW WHAT A FIFTH NUCLEAR TEST
A REPORT BY M. PEAS SAYS CUTS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY SUBSIDIES HAVE ALARMED INVESTORS AND MAY INADVERTENTLY DRIVE OUR BILLS THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE COMMITTEE SAYS RECENT CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICY HAVE PUT PEOPLE OFF INVESTING IN THEIR SECTOR BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF REGULATIONS HERE'S OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER HERB
THE M.P.S SAY ENERGY FIRMS ACCEPTS THAT GOVERNMENT POLICIES MAY SHIFT WHAT'S SPOOKED INVESTORS THEY SAY IS THE SUDDEN FLURRY OF CUTS TO RENEWABLE SUBSIDIES WITHOUT CONSULTING INDUSTRY OVER THE CONSEQUENCES
THE M.P.S WARNED THAT JUST AS SOMEONE WITH A POOR CREDIT RATING IS CHARGED HIGHER INTEREST FOR BORROWING SO FIRMS DEVELOPING ENERGY PROJECTS IN THE U.K. WILL FACE HIGHER INTEREST RATES FROM INVESTORS NERVOUS THAT POLICIES MAY TWIST AGAIN
THE EXTRA COST OF BORROWING THE M.P.S SAY WOULD PASS TO CONSUMERS AND FORCE BUILDS UP WHEN THEY WERE INTENDED TO GO

THANK YOU CHRIS IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN A BORDER LIST EUROPE THAT WAS THE DREAM OF MANY TRUE BELIEVERS IN EUROPEAN UNITY IT IS A DREAM SHATTERED BY THE SIZE OF MILE AFTER MILE OF RAZOR WIRE FENCES HASTILY ERECTED TO DO WHAT THE E.U. HAS SO FAR FAILED TO DO TO CONTROL THE SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING FLOW OF MIGRANTS COMING FROM THE WORLD'S TROUBLES OWNS THE MANTLE CHARA CRISIS SUMMIT NEXT MONDAY THE PRESENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK
HE'S IN INCREASED TODAY SEARCHING FOR AN AGREED WAY FORWARD BUT AUSTRIA HAS NOT BEEN PREPARED TO WAIT HER GOVERNMENT AS WORK WITH FOUR IN BALKAN STATES TO IMPOSE THEIR OWN CAPS ON NUMBERS RISKING THE RAT HAVE AMONGST OTHERS GERMANY I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO RYAN HARD LUCK PAT HE'S THE PARLIAMENTARY CHAIR OF THE AUSTRIAN PEOPLE'S PARTY POT OF THAT COUNTRY'S GOVERNING COALITION
QUESTIONS AND OUR PEOPLE AFRAID AUSTRIA'S IN A SPECIALIST TUITION BECAUSE AUSTRIA IS NOT A COUNTRY OF TRANSIT
AUSTRIA IS ALSO A COUNTRY VERRA M. MORE TO NINETY FIVE
PEOPLE STOPPED DAVE REQUEST FOR ASYLUM LAST YEAR AND SO AUSTRIA SWEDEN AND GERMANY HAS THEIR HIGHEST BACUP IT
RATE OF ASYLUM SEEKERS YOU SAY AUSTRIAN PEOPLE ARE AFRAID WHY THEREFORE
I TOOK IT FOR YOUR ONE CONCRETE OF THE BIGGEST SCREW
RICHER ARRIVED LAST YEAR WHERE PEOPLE FROM AFGHANISTAN
THIRTY PERCENT OFF THIS PEOPLE ILLITERATE THEY ARE NOT ABLE
TO READ THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO WRITE
COMING FROM A SOCIETY WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO
FOR EUROPEAN SOCIETY SO THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY AND IT ISN'T ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICES COPING IT'S ABOUT THE TOTAL PEOPLE AND INTEGRATION
YES THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE OF INTEGRATION AND THEN WE HAVE SOME NEGATIVE EXAMPLES HOW THEY TREAT WOMEN ESPECIALLY
HOW THEY TREAT THEIR CHILDREN AUSTRIA'S ALWAYS THOUGHT OF ITSELF AS A GOOD EUROPEAN COUNTRY AND YOU HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION CAPPING THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS PUTTING UP THERE YES
IS THIS A MOMENT WHERE AUSTRIA IS COMING TO BELIEVE THAT HE YOU CANNOT DELIVER THE SOLUTIONS ANY MORE YOU KNOW UNTIL TODAY WE SAY WE NEED A EUROPEAN SOLUTION AND BEFORE IT SUPPORTED EUROPEAN SOLUTION
BUT I'LL BE WAITING WAITING WAITING DEBORAH PROMISES PROMISES BUT INDEED FOR EUROPEANS
IT'S A WHOLE HEAD NO CHANCE IN THE LAST YEAR TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM LET'S BE CLEAR A SOLUTION AT EUROPEAN LEVEL WOULD MEAN ALLOCATING NUMBERS OF REFUGEES TO OTHER COUNTRIES THAT SIMPLY DON'T NEED TO TAKE THEM
MUM MUM MUM A BOMB THAT THIS WILL BE WE WE HAVE WE HAVE TO START DORWOOD TOOK TOO MUCH MORE FOR THE COUNTRIES WERE
MILLIONS OF FOREVER EFFORT SHE'S ALREADY I'M SPEAKING OFF DIRK I'M SPEAKING OF LEBANON
SECOND THEN WE WE HAVE
D'YOU EVER THINK TO GO TO SECURE OUR EXTERNAL BORDERS
THERE IS NO SIGN WELL IS THERE NO SIGN OF OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES VOLUNTEERING TO TAKE THE NUMBERS THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF AUSTRIA AND OTHER STATES IF THE E.U. YOU CANNOT AGREE ON THIS ITS GREATEST CRISIS
IS THAT NOT A CRISIS FOR THE E.U. AS AN INSTITUTION ITSELF PROOF THAT IT'S SIMPLY CANNOT COPE
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY IT'S THE BIGGEST CRISIS SINCE THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS FOUNDED AS A POLITICAL
REALLY IT DID IT IT'S A CRECHE
AFTER SHOOT OFF TO EUROPEAN UNION AND IF WE ARE NOT THAT ABLE TO FIND A SOLUTION
THEN WE WILL NOT PERFECT EUROPEAN UNION AS WE HAVE NOW AND THERE'S A SECOND QUESTION
THEIR REFERENDUM INCH SHAWN ENJOY O.K.
SO THAT THAT'S A MIXED A PROBLEM THE NEXT CHALLENGE MY DEAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME IS NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN SOON AFTER THE ELECTION THE GOVERNMENT MADE A SERIES OF CUTS TO SUBSIDIES FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY INCLUDING SOLAR PANELS AND ONSHORE WIND NOW A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S SAYS THE CONFIDENCE OF INVESTORS HAS BEEN DENTED BY THAT AND IT'S THREATENING THE U.K.'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS CLIMATE CHANGE TARGETS THE CHAIR OF THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE COMMITTEE IS THE S.N.P. M.P. ANGUS MACNEIL AND HE JOINS US FROM WESTMINSTER GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MICHELLE
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU SAY INVESTOR CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS WELL SHE'S BEEN VEST IN EFFECTED QUITE A LOT THE FEELING THAT FROM INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS BANK'S PRIVATE EQUITY PROVIDERS ACADEMICS N.G.O.S DID ASSOCIATIONS ARE MANY OTHERS WHO CAME TO US WAS THAT THE SUDDEN ANNOUNCEMENT BY BY DECKING IN THE SUMMER FOLLOWING THE ELECTION HAS MADE THEM JITTERY AND MADE INVESTMENT JITTERY AND SOME OF YOU COULD BE A TWO PERCENT PREMIUM WHAT UP TO THREE BILLION POUNDS X. IN EXTRA BORROWING COSTS AS THE RESULT OF THIS
IT'S QUITE A LOT OF MONEY AND IT WAS ME IT HAS GOT THAT ALL HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE FOR THE SPEED AND THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN LUSH AND POLICY BY THE U.K. GOVERNMENT ON NIPS PARTICULAR ONSHORE WIND AND SOLAR RIGHT BUT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE SAID THAT
THE REASON THEY DID THIS PART OF THE REASON THEY DID THIS WAS TO KEEP BILLS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE SUBSIDIES ARE PAID BY FOR BY ALL OF US THROUGH THAT THROUGH THE LEVEES ON OUR BILLS AT THE MOMENT THEY HAD ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT POUNDS TO PEOPLE'S ANNUAL ENERGY BILLS AT THIS WAS PROJECTED TO GO UP TO SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED FORTY POUNDS A YEAR BY TWENTY TWENTY
IF THE GOVERNMENT HADN'T TAKEN THIS ACTION SO THE COSTS WERE GETTING OUT OF CONTROL WEREN'T THEY WELL NOT REALLY BUT THAT'S THE TOTAL EVERY CONTROL FRAMEWORK SUPPORTING AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS ARE CALLING FOR IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PUBLISH THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE METHODOLOGIES THAT UNDERPINNED THESE CALCULATIONS OF JUST HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING SPENT IN THE LEVY CONTROL FOR MC GOVERNMENT ARE NOT DOING THAT SO IT WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO GO UP WOULDN'T IT THE AMOUNT ON OUR BILLS IF THE GOVERNMENT HADN'T ACTED TO TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT SPENT ON THE SUBSIDY WE'VE GOT ARE TWO THINGS THERE AND THE FIRST THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT
ANY COSTS BUT I STILL DON'T ENCOURAGE THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME ACTUALLY AND INVESTMENTS FOR THE FUTURE WHICH MAY COST LORD IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THEIR INVESTMENT OF COURSE WE BOUGHT IN THE PAST NOW GIVE US TUBULAR BELLS AT THE PLEASANT AS WELL THAT COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A ROW WHEN ARE WE DUE TO THE PRICE OF A FOSSIL FUELS COULDN'T
AND ALSO AS I'VE JUST SAID THE EFFECT OF THE PREVIOUS RENEWABLES ON THEY'RE ON THE SYSTEM WHICH ARE LORDY HOLES IN PLACES AS WELL IN FACT IT WAS MUCH AS THE OTHER WEEK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THEY WERE TELLING US THAT NUCLEAR PLANT IN SWEDEN
HE'S HE'S GOING OUT OF OPERATION BECAUSE IT CAN'T COPE THEY'VE CAB COMPETES AGAINST RENEWABLE SO THERE'S A LOT DEMAND BEEN MADE AND RENEWABLES THAT I'VE BEEN MADE ANOTHER SECTORS AND WE HAVE TO ALSO PUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF AMBER ROD'S RESEARCH BEACH THE SECRETARY OF STATE WHO SAY THAT NO ENERGY NO FORMS OF ENERGY AT THE MOMENT IT CAN IT CAN COME INTO THE MIKE A PIECE OF THAT GOVERNMENTS BUT BUT THERE ARE OTHER CHOICES BEING MADE BOTH ON ON THE RENEWABLE FRONT FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE WHAT IT'S DOING ON OFFSHORE WIND AND LOW CARBON ENERGY SOURCES NUCLEAR SHALE GAS
WELL AHEAD OF SHALE GAS IS LOW CARBON HAD THAT FROM DECK YESTERDAY I'M VERY SURPRISED THAT THE SAID THAT NUCLEAR WEREN'T MY GOODNESS WHERE IS WHERE'S THAT GOING TO GO WHAT E.D.F. GOING TO SEE A BIT ABOUT HINCKLEY BUT THEY THE OFFSHORE OF WIND IN THE CHOICES YOU MAKE
IF THE TALKER BUT COSTA CERTAINLY CHOOSE IN THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONES FOR THE BILL PAYERS THE CHEAPEST ONE IS ONSHORE WIND AND THE GOVERNMENT HAVE RUN AWAY FROM THAT FOR MORE EXPENSIVE RENEWABLES AND OF COURSE I WAS DIVING THE GOVERNMENT'S THINKING THEN THEY'RE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY AGAIN CONTRADICTORY MESSAGES AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE CONTRADICTORY MESSAGES THAT THAT AT THAT PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS IN THE GOVERNMENT I THINK IN FUTURE HAS TO MAKE AN INVESTOR IMPACT ASSESSMENT BEFORE IT LUSCIOUS AND POLICY
ANGUS MACNEIL THANK YOU THANK YOU IT IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ONE OF THE U.K.'S CHALLENGER BANKS ARE JUST REPORTED A JUMP IN PROFIT HAS ITS PILED ON NEW BUSINESS TANYA'S HEAD TO TELL US MORE I'M GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN THAT YES SURE BROOK BANK THE SAS IT SAYS THAT FULLY OR PROFITS FOR LAST YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN WELL FIFTY EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION THAT'S UP FROM THIRTY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION
AND IT'S DRIVEN BY A FORTY FOUR PERCENT INCREASE IN THE LOAN BOOK QUITE SIMPLY TO THREE AND A THIRD BILLION POUNDS DEPARTEMENT ENSURE BROOK BANK'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE HE JOINS ME NOW DOWN THE LINE SO LENDING MONEY TO WHOM AND TO DO WHAT OUR BUSINESS IS FOCUSED ON THREE AREAS SO WE LENT TO SMALL BUSINESSES WE TO CONSUMERS AND WE LENCI IN THE PROPERTY MARKET AS WELL SO HOW IS IT THAT YOU'RE MAKING MONEY WHEN THE BUT THE BIGGER BANKS OF STRUGGLE
BANKS LIKE SURE BROOK EXIST BECAUSE WE IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THE LARGER BANKS ARE ARE NOT NECESSARILY INTERESTED IN THAT QUITE BASE IT DOESN'T FIT THERE HIS PROFILE AND THAT'S THAT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR THESE CUSTOMER SEGMENTS BRIGHT SO ITS NICHE BANKING IN OTHER WORDS WHAT ARE THESE AREAS I KNOW ONE OF THEM IS LENDING MORTGAGES OR PROVIDING MORTGAGES TO PENSIONERS
WHERE THE AIR IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS TRYING TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING TO THE END OF THEIR MORTGAGE TERM THEY'VE GOT INTEREST ONLY MORTGAGES AND THEY'RE INTERESTED IN STAYING IN THEIR HOMES FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS OR SO WE THINK THAT'S AN ACCEPTABLE RISK AND SUMMIT WE CAN SUPPORT THEM WE'RE LOOKING TO TRY AND DEVELOP A PRODUCT SWEET TO HELP THAT THAT CUSTOMER BASE SO HOW IS IT THAT YOU CAN MAKE THAT WORK COMMERCIALLY ANOTHER BANKS CAN'T THAT'S MY QUESTION
I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE TRY TO LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING RISK OF EACH ASSET CLASS AND EACH CUSTOMER BASE RATHER THAN TAKE A GENERIC WRIST DECISION IN THE PRICE SO IT'S GOING TO SAY MORE SOMEONE'S GOT A CREDIT SCORE OF X. AND THEY CURED AND WHY AND THEY'RE NOT SO GOOD IF THEY CRUNCH GOES UNDER THAT WE TEND TO LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCE A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THEIR HOUSES FOR MANY YEARS
LOWLAND TO VALUES THEY'VE GOT RETIREMENT INCOMES THEY'VE BEEN PENNY MORTGAGES FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS THEY PROBABLY WANT TO STAY THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOW LOOKING AFTER THEIR GRANDCHILDREN MAYBE THEIR ORIGINAL PLAN TO LEAD TO THE COUNTRYSIDE PEASANT WORKED OUT THEY ANOTHER TEN YEARS ON THAT TYPE OF PROPERTY FOR THAT TYPE OF INDIVIDUALS ARE PERFECTLY GOOD RISK RIGHT SO THAT'S THE SIDE OF THE BALANCE IT WHAT ABOUT THE LIABILITY SIDE WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR MONEY FROM PRIMARILY A LOT IN LARGE PART ANYWAY FROM DEPOSITORS YES WHY DOES THAT OR KEEP THEM SATISFIED
WELL WE'VE ALWAYS COMPETED VERY WELL IN TERMS OF THE PRICES THAT WE OFFER AND OUR SAVINGS PRODUCTS AND WE CONTINUE TO OFFER A RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS FROM NOTICE ACCOUNT THREE TO FIVE YEAR BONDS AND AN ATTRACTIVE RATE OF INTEREST BUT ONE THAT ALLOWS US TO ALSO LEND OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A BALANCE SHEET AT RATES THAT AREN'T
TOO HIGH EITHER AND JUST BRIEFLY THE REGULATOR IN THE TAX ENVIRONMENT HOW'S THAT WORKING FOR YOU AT THE MOMENT I THINK THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND AN EVOLUTION THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE CHALLENGES SO THE THE DISCUSSION AROUND THE CAPITAL TREATMENT FOR BANKS IS ONGOING AND HE'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT AREA TO RESOLVE PROPERLY SO THAT CHALLENGER BANKS WERE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH THEIR LARGE APPEARS STEVE PAYMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS TWENTY PAST SEVEN ANYONE WHO'S WATCHED CRICKET FROM ALL AT THE OVAL IN SOUTH LONDON WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH THE LARGE VICTORIAN GAS HOLDER NEXT TO THE GROUND THE DISTINCTIVE STRUCTURE HAS BEEN THE BACKDROP TO THE OVAL FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS AND NOW IT IS TO BE PROTECTED GIVEN GRADE TWO LISTED STATUS ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF HISTORIC ENGLAND
IT'S HEAD OF DESIGNATIONS EMILY JEAN SHE'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS WELL HE'S STARTING THEN CAN RECOMMEND BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES FOR LISTON HAVE SPECIAL ARCHITECTURAL AND HISTORIC INTEREST AND THIS GAS HOLDER HAS BOTH IT MARKS A REALLY IMPORTANT MOMENT IN GAS HOLDER TECHNOLOGY VICTORIAN GAS HOLDERS AT ONCE UBIQUITOUS ACROSS OUR LANDSCAPES AND THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT MOMENT WHERE WROUGHT IRON WAS INTRODUCED THERE'D BE MUCH BIGGER AND MUCH STRONGER ARM IT WAS FAST WAS THE WORLD'S LARGEST WHEN IT WAS BUILT
BUT IT ALSO HAS VERY STRONG HISTORIC INTEREST AS YOU SAY IT BEEN THIS BACKDROP TO THE OVAL IT'S PROBABLY THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS GAS HOLDER AND WAS IT THREATENED IS THAT WHY YOU DECIDED TO LIST IT HEARS OF THIS HE'LL GAS HOLDERS WERE USED ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT NOW THEY ARE REDUNDANT TECHNOLOGY LARGELY AND THIS ONE THIS ONE HAS BEEN DECONTAMINATED THE SITE IS NOW OUT OF USE DECOMMISSIONED AND THEIR PROPOSALS FOR THE SITE THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT PERHAPS THE GAS HOLDER CAN BE REUSED IN THE SEE THAT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFULLY DONE AT SAINT PANCREAS AND KING'S CROSS WHERE
THE GAS HOLDERS NOW USED AS AN URBAN PARK ENTER SURROUNDS NEW HOUSING SO VICTORIAN TECHNOLOGY CAN REALLY BE AT THE HEART OF THE SORT OF SCHEMES SO THE GRADE TWO LISTING DOESN'T PREVENT IT BEING RE USED IT THE STRUCTURE HAS TO BE KEPT IN PLACE BUT IT CAN BE PART OF SOMETHING NEW THAT'S RIGHT LISTENING AS JUST A MARKER OF SPECIAL INTEREST SO IT MEANS THAT NEEDS ISSUES NEED TO BE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF FUTURE USE THERE WE ONLY PROTECT THE STRUCTURE WERE VERY CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT PROTECTING ANY UNDERGROUND REMAINS AND IT'S REALLY JUST A VERY ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURAL GAS HOLDER ITSELF
AND NINE QUESTIONS CAN WE ASK HOW THEY CAN BE MOST SYMPATHETICALLY CONSIDERED AS PART OF FUTURE YEARS SO HOPEFULLY IT WILL REMAIN THERE IS THAT VERY ICONIC BACKDROP IT'S PERHAPS AS THEY SAY THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS RIVAL ANY MAYBE BY SOME GUS ALL DISAPPEAR IN THE LADYKILLERS EMILY CHI OF HISTORIC ENGLAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN

MEANING HISTORICALLY IT'S NATIONAL NETWORKS YOU COULD REGULATE NATIONALLY
THAT'S VODAFONE AS DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY MARCUS RHINE ISH WHEN DIGITAL TELEPHONY CAME IN EVERYTHING CHANGED WHICH PRODUCTS AND DIGITAL WORLD IS BORDER LESS IF A U.S. COMPANY FOR EXAMPLE DEVELOPS AN APPLICATION THAT TRAVELS GLOBALLY AND THIS IS WHERE EUROPE IS GOING TO EVERY COUNTRY'S GOING EVERY COMPANIES GOING IS HE'S A GLOBAL EXPANSION SO THEREFORE YOU CAN'T REGULATE NATIONALLY ANY MORE YOU HAVE TO
A EUROPEAN THEM IDEALLY CLUB APPROACH THAT GLOBAL APPROACH THAT HE MENTIONS WILL COME BACK TO IT IN A BIT FIRST THOUGH ASK ANY SUPPORTER OF THE E.U. WHY WE SHOULD STAY AND THEY'RE LIKELY TO THROW IN THIS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAS PASSED A NEW LAW TO ABOLISH EXTRA CHARGES FOR USING A MOBILE PHONE WHILE TRAVELLING AROUND THE LAB ONE OF THE UNION'S GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS HAS BEEN RE ABOLITION OF ROAMING
TO VANISHED BY TWENTY SEVENTY BID NOW GETTING TO
TOUGHEN UP BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AGAINST THE MAJOR BONE OPERATE
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW ROAMING MIGHT HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED BY INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ACTING ALONE
WOULD WE STILL BENEFIT FROM THE DEAL IF WE LEFT PROBABLY NORWAY ICELAND AND
ALL THE OUTSIDE THE UNION BUT THEY ARE IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND BE PART OF THE ROAMING ARRANGEMENT
SWITZERLAND BOAT IT'S NOT
THAT IS THE SOUND OF A SMARTPHONE PASSING THROUGH A SHREDDER
AND THE SOUND OF IT COMING OUT THE OTHER SIDE BITS OF METAL LITTLE BITS OF PLASTIC THE COMPONENTS INSIDE A MOBILE PHONE ARE CONTROLLED BY E.U. RESTRICTIONS ON HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES THERE ARE E.U. REGULATIONS ON RECYCLING THE RARE EARTHS AND OTHER ELEMENTS IN HER PHONE AND THEY'RE DOING JUST THAT AT A D. C. I.T. DISPOSAL AND RECYCLING IN ESSEX
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING WE DO IS RELATED TO E.U. REGULATIONS ON THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE I.T. WHERE ANDY WARNER IS THE HEAD OF CORPORATE SERVICES THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE SET OUT ALL THE RULES THAT ALL OF THE COMPANIES HAVE TO FOLLOW IN THIS INDUSTRY IT'S BEING AT THE E.U. LEVEL

LEVEL MAKES SENSE AND SOME TOLD ME THAT THE RULES HAVE CHANGED THEIR PHYSICAL PRODUCT DESIGN FOR THE BETTER

NEW GUIDELINES MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WHEN SOMEBODY HAS SET UP A FALSE IDENTITY OR USE SOMEBODY ELSE'S IDENTITY AND THEN POSTED PICTURES LIKE THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE PROSECUTING THE REVENGE PORNOGRAPHY OFFENCES WHICH WERE NEW LAST YEAR AND CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF THOSE CASES GOING THROUGH THE COURTS AND I WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THAT IN FOLAMI'S CASE HER
EX PARTNER WAS INDEED PROSECUTED AND CONVICTED SO BUT WOULD YOU GET A LONGER SENT HERE'S HIS SENTENCE WAS A SIX MONTH SUSPENDED SENTENCE IN THIS IN THIS NEW FRAMEWORK WOULD WOULD HE GET A CUSTODIAL SENTENCE OR A LONGER ONE WHERE THE GUIDELINES ARE FOR PROSECUTORS WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T IMPOSE THE SENTENCE IS THAT'S A MATTER FOR THE COURTS
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR PROSECUTORS IS THAT THEY MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE FOR ALL THE SORT OF AGGRAVATING FACTORS TO THE COURTS AT THE COURT CAN IMPOSE A SENTENCE THAT'S APPROPRIATE AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN SOME CASES OF REVENGE PORNOGRAPHY NOT JUST WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SUSPENDED SENSES BUT WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED DO YOU TAKE THE POINT THAT SHE MADE ABOUT THE ANONYMITY OF VICTIMS THAT IN A CASE LIKE THIS THERE IS NO ANONYMITY AS THERE IS FOR A FOR A RAPE VICTIM SO SHE HAD TO WHEN SHE WENT TO COURT SHE HAD TO SEE HER HER NAME
OUT THERE AGAIN WHICH WAS PART OF THE FORMER PARTNERS INTENTION IN THE FIRST GREAT ABSOLUTELY AND I ENTIRELY AGREE WITH HER BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF COURSE THE REVENGE PORNOGRAPHY OFFENCE IS ALL ABOUT HUMILIATING EMBARRASSING CAUSING DISTRESS TO THE VICTIMS BY GOING TO COURT OR NOT HAVING ANY ANONYMITY AND ANY PROTECTION IN THAT WAY IT'S HER MET TO SOME EXTENT DOES EXACERBATE THAT AS WELL ARE YOU PROPOSING THAT THEN I HAD PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED THAT WE LOOK AT THAT FOUR
VICTIMS AGAIN IT'S NOT WITHIN MY GIFT TO DO THAT IT'S A MATTER OF LEGISLATION DO YOU BELIEVE IT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I DO IN THE SAME WAYS IN BLACKMAIL CASES FOR THE SAME REASONS AGAIN WE LOOK AT ANONYMITY THERE FOR VICTIMS AS WELL THE BUT THE BROAD THRUST OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS TAKING THE LAW FURTHER INTO THE ONLINE SPHERE OF SOMEONE'S ACTIVITY AND THEREFORE INTO THE FURTHER INTO THE SPHERE OF
PEOPLE'S FREE SPEECH POSSIBLY INFRINGING PEOPLE'S FREE SPEECH SO HOW WOULD YOU WHERE WOULD YOU DRAW THE LINE WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN HI SAY WHERE WE LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S MALICIOUS COMMUNICATIONS AND PEOPLE ARE SORT OF TRADING INSULTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OVER THE INTERNET WE'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE OFFENCE THERE IT'S GROSSLY OFFENSIVE SO THAT'S A VERY HIGH THRESHOLD WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS WE ALL
USE THE INTERNET ALL THE TIME WE USE SOCIAL MEDIA ALL THE TIME IT IS A FANTASTIC TOOL WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS HURT DO ANYTHING THAT'S A CHILLING EFFECT ON FREE SPEECH BUT WHERE IT'S USED FOR CRIME AND WEAR IT SERIOUSLY IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES THEN THAT'S WHERE WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT IT AND LOOK AT WHETHER WE'VE HAD THE EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE AND SO THE MESSAGE YOU'RE SENDING TWO TO ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE CONSIDERING DOING THIS SORT OF THING IS BE AWARE THAT WHAT YOU WERE DOING ONLINE IS ALSO A CRIME ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT'S QUITE OFTEN PEOPLE FORGET
THE INTERNET SO QUICK PEOPLE USE IT SORT OF WITHOUT THINKING SOMETIMES ACTUALLY STOP AND THINK BECAUSE WHAT YOU ARE DOING COULD BE INJURING SOMEBODY COULD BE ABUSING SOMEBODY AND THAT WILL BE AN OFFENCE WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE WE WILL PROSECUTE IT SHOULD YOU HAVE LOOKED AT THESE GUIDELINES ON SOCIAL MEDIA EARLIER THEY'VE BEEN IN PLACE I THINK FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS DURING WHICH TIME THE INTERNET LANDSCAPE AND PEOPLE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IS CHANGED TREMENDOUSLY
ABSOLUTELY IN THE GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD FOR HER FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS THEY DID NEED UPDATING THERE'D BE NEW OFFENCES WHICH WE HAVE PUT IN A NEW WAY OF USING SOCIAL MEDIA ARE NEW PLATFORMS SO THAT'S WHY IT'S TIMELY NOW TO UPDATE THEM AND PUT IT OUT FOR CONSULTATION
FOR YEARS AS IT WAS A LONG TIME IN THE WORLD OF SOCIAL AND IT IS A LONG TIME WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY IN SOME STABILITY WE DON'T WANT TO BE CHANGE THEM EVERY SIX MONTHS SO THAT'S WHY NOW IS A GOOD TIME BECAUSE IF WE CHANGE THEM TWELVE MONTHS AGO WE'D HAVE MISSED THE NEW OFFENCES CAME IN SO IT'S A GOOD TIME TO DO IT ALISON SAUNDERS DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU
EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE DAILY MIRROR IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMONGST SEVERAL WHICH FEATURE A JUDGE'S WARNING TO THE DISGRACED ENGLAND FOOTBALLER ADAM JOHNSON TO SAY GOODBYE TO HIS DAUGHTER AFTER BEING FOUND GUILTY OF SEX OFFENCES THE DAILY MAIL SAYS HIS FALL FROM GRACE IS THE ULTIMATE FOOTBALL MORALITY TALE WAS THE NEW DAY SAYS HE NOW BE HELD UP AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN GO WRONG FOR YOUNG FOOTBALLERS
THE TIMES DESCRIBES A NIGHTCLUB WORLD WHERE FOOTBALLERS OF THE GREATEST CELEBRITIES SURROUNDED BY GIRLS THE PAPER'S QUESTION WHY HIS CLUB SUNDERLAND DIDN'T SUSPEND JOHNSON WHEN IT FIRST LEARNT OF THE CHARGES HE FACED THE CLUB HE SAID IT BELIEVED HE WAS TO PLEAD NOT GUILTY AND ACTED QUICKLY WHEN HE DID ADMIT GROOMING AND SEXUAL ACTIVITY THE TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH WHAT IT CALLS THE ASTONISHING ADMISSION BY LORD ROSE WHO HEADS THE CAMPAIGN TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE E.U. THAT WAGES WOULD RISE IF THE COUNTRY WITHDREW
YOU'RE A SCEPTIC CAMPAIGNER SAID HIS COMMENTS TO A SELECT COMMITTEE HAD HELPED MAKE THE CASE FOR LEAVING THE MALE CALLS HIS ADMISSION SENSATIONAL AND SAYS HE FLOUNDERED IN HIS EXCHANGES WITH M.P.S THE TELEGRAPHS EDITORIAL SAYS LORD ROSE IS PROVING TO BE MORE A LIABILITY THAN AN ASSET BUT SAYS HE IS JUST THE LATEST FIGURE FROM THE TWO CAMPAIGNS TO OFFER ARGUMENTS DEVOID OF FACTS AND FIGURES IT SAYS THE DEMAND FOR DETAIL FROM VOTERS IS UNDENIABLE BUT THE POLITICIANS ARE PROVING UNFORGIVING THE INCAPABLE OF PROVIDING IT
THE FINANCIAL TIMES SAYS THAT ENERGY SUPPLIES HAD TO BE FORCED TO OPEN UP THEIR DATABASES TO RIVALS SO THEY CAN OFFER CUSTOMERS BETTER DEALS IT SAYS THE COMPETITION MARKETS AUTHORITY WILL ANNOUNCE THE PLAN NEXT WEEK BUT THAT IS WATER DOWN A PROPOSAL FOR A TEMPORARY PRICE GAP WHILST REFORMS TO THE INDUSTRY ARE MADE THE F. T. SAYS THE MOVE TO OPEN UP CUSTOMER RECORDS WILL BE RESISTED BY BIG FIRMS WHO IT SAYS GUARD THEIR DATABASES JEALOUSLY
THERE ARE WARM TRIBUTES TO TONY WARREN CREATOR OF CORONATION STREET WHO DIED YESTERDAY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY NINE THE DAILY EXPRESS CALLS HIM A GENIUS PRAISING HIS REMARKABLE OBSERVATIONAL TALENTS FOR THE SON HE WAS A GIANT INFLUENCE ON BRITISH LIFE YOU BROUGHT PLEASURE TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THE OBITUARY IN THE INDEPENDENT SAYS WARREN'S IMPACT ON TELEVISION WAS INCALCULABLE IT SAYS WHAT REMAINS IN CORONATION STREET IS A BLEND OF IDENTIFIABLE CHARACTERS FIZZING DIALOGUE AND NORTHERN SOUL THREE THINGS WHICH WILL ALWAYS CARRY TONY WARREN'S SIGNATURE ON THEM
SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT O'CLOCK NO EACH DAY THIS WE'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO HEAR A REMARKABLE DIARY GIVES A RARE INSIDE HIM WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IT'S BEEN WRITTEN BY AN ACTIVIST LIVING IN RAKKA THE CAPITAL OF THE SELF DECLARED CALLA FATE IN SYRIA AND DETAILS FROM THE CASUAL ATROCITIES CARRIED OUT BY THE MILITANTS WE'VE GOT AN ACTOR TO RECORD HIS WORDS AND WE'VE ALSO HAD TO CHANGE SOME OF THE DETAILS HE DESCRIBES TO PROTECT HIS IDENTITY
WE THOUGHT WE'D FINISHED OUR COMPULSORY SURELY A COURSE BUT THEN WE HEARD WE STILL HAD TO ATTEND NIGHT CLASSES AT THE MOSQUE AS WELL SO TWO DID MANY SHOP OWNERS THIS IS WHY SO MANY OR FLOCK OF SHOPS ARE SHUT MY FRIEND DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR THE LESSON WHEN TO DASH GUY DEMANDED TO KNOW WHERE HE WAS WE SAID HE WAS ILL
WE LATER HEARD THAT THEY'D RAIDED HIS HOME BUT HE WASN'T THERE WE'VE NOW FINISHED THE WEEK LONG COURSE AND HAVE OFFICIALLY RE ENTERED ISLAM AS BORN AGAIN MUSLIMS
THE NEXT DAY I WALK TO WORK WITH CONFIDENT STRIDES IT DASH MAN STOPPED ME AND ASKED ME IF I'VE DONE MY DAWN PRAYER US YES OF COURSE BUT HE CLEARLY THOUGHT I WAS LYING
WHICH BIT OF PUT ON HAVE YOU READ I WAS SAVED WHEN A WOMAN WHO WASN'T COVERING HER EYES PROPERLY WALKED PAST THE MAN WASHED OVER TO CONFRONT HER
I CARRIED ON AS QUICKLY AS I COULD TO THE SHOP WHERE I WORK
BUT THINGS GOT WORSE WHEN I WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR I WAS TOLD THAT TWO MEN HAD COME TO THE SHOP AND ASKED WHERE I WAS
I STARTED TO PANIC AND MY HANDS BEGAN TO SHAKE I ASKED WHO THEY WERE
I DON'T KNOW BUT ONE OF THEM WAS CARRYING A GUN WAS I GOING TO BE LAST OR SENT TO FIGHT FOR DASH ON THE FRONT LINE MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO RUN AWAY BUT I KNEW THAT SOON COME AFTER ME
I SPEND THE WHOLE DAY THINKING ABOUT THOSE TWO MEN AND WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BUT NOBODY CAME TO GET ME AND AS SOON AS THE SHOP CLOSED I WENT STRAIGHT HOME WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU MY MOTHER ASKED WHY DO YOU LOOK SO PALE MOTHER'S SPORT THESE SORT OF THINGS
I HAD NO APPETITE FOR DINNER I KEPT THINKING HOW MY MOTHER WOULD REACT IF DASH CAME TOWARD HOME TO GET TO ME SHE KEPT ASKING WHAT WAS WORRYING ME BUT I WOULDN'T SAY I DIDN'T WANT TO WORRY HER
I DIDN'T SLEEP ALL NIGHT AND I DON'T THINK MY MOTHER DID EITHER IN THE MORNING I LEFT EARLY AND HEADED TO THE SHOP TO OPEN UP A BROTHER THEY TAKE ME AWAY FROM THERE THEN IN FRONT OF MY MOTHER
IT'S ALL ARMED MAN CAME IN AND I THOUGHT THIS IS IT BUT HE SMILED AND TOLD ME NOT TO LOOK SO WORRIED THEN YOURS WASN'T SO GOOD ABOUT MY FRIEND HE'D BEEN SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR MISSING THERE SHOULD BE A CLASS
THANKFULLY THE MAN IN FRONT OF ME HAD WARNED HIM AND HE'D RUN AWAY BEFORE DASH YOU'VE GOT HIM
TODAY HAS BEEN A REALLY SCARY DAY IN THE EVENING I WENT TO VISIT MOHAMMED WHO IS NEARER MY FATHER'S AGE THEN MINE WE SAT DOWN TOGETHER AND I ASKED HIM IF YOU COULD HELP ME DEAL WITH THE DESPERATE SITUATION WE'RE IN HE TOLD ME LIVE YOUR LIFE WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE PRESENT
IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING ON A ROPE BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS THE PRESIDENT IS THE GROUND BELOW WALK STRAIGHT AHEAD AND FOCUS ONLY ON CROSSING THE MOUNTAIN NEVER LOOKED DOWN FROM NOW ON I WILL TAKE HIS ADVICE AND TRY TO KEEP WALKING STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL I REACH THE OTHER MOUNTAIN WHEN I GET THERE THE PRESENT WILL BE GONE
AS WITH ALL THE DRAMATIC DIARIES WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM OF THIS WEEK YOU CAN SEE A VERY ABSORBING ANIMATION OF THE MAMMA WEBSITE EVEN IF YOU'VE HEARD THE DIARIES IT'S REALLY WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE PARTLY FOR THE WORK OF THE ARTIST SCOTT QUINNELL THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER AND A CARD OF STUDIO THIS MORNING IS I CAN DADDY DOES SURVIVE OF HINDU TEACHER AND THEOLOGIAN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THE SHOW WAS IN THE DECADES OF THE TROUBLES IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE BOMBING IN OMA WAS PARTICULARLY SHOCKING IN ITS MURDEROUS WANT AN EVIL
NOW WITH THE COLLAPSE OF THE CASE AGAINST SEAMUS DALY DALY SOME OF THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS SAY THEY HAVE LOST THEIR LAST CHANCE FOR JUSTICE AND WITH THAT PERHAPS THEY FEEL THEIR BEST HOPE FOR SOME CLOSURE FOR THEY AGREE
I FOUND THERE'S WIDESPREAD INSTINCT AMONGST MANY MANY PEOPLE BUT THE WORLD SHOULD BE FAIR THAT GOOD DESERVES REWARDING AND THE WRONGDOERS SHOULD GET THEIR COMEUPPANCE ALWAYS SIMPLY HARDWIRED FOR OPTIMISM OR AS MANY HINDUS WOULD SAY HE'S HAD AN INDICATION WERE INSTINCTIVELY AWARE OF A PROCESS WITHIN THE UNIVERSE THAT BALANCES OUT OUR ACTIONS AND THEIR REPERCUSSIONS THIS IS SOMETIMES TERMED THE LAW OF KARMA
AND LIKE MANY ASPECTS OF HINDU THEOLOGY OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD KARMA IS NOT FATALISTIC IT IS BASED ON HUMANS HAVING FREE WILL KARMA IS SIMPLY THE EXTRAPOLATION OF OUR USE OF THAT FREE WILL BUT IT'S NOT SIMPLE NOR LYNNIE
IT'S PROBABLY MORE LIKE CHAOS THEORY THAT A BUTTERFLY FLAPS ITS WINGS IN A HURRICANE HAPPENS AND MANY HINDU TEXT SAY THAT THE SPECIFIC OUTCOMES FROM OUR ACTIONS ARE JUST AS COMPLEX AND UNFATHOMABLE AND THEY WARN US THERE FOR NEVER TO BE JUDGEMENTAL AS WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT EFFECT HAS BEEN CAUSED BY WHAT ACTION
NOR DOES KARMA USUALLY HAVE IMMEDIATE EFFECT IT PLAYS OUT OVER MANY LIFETIMES AND IT'S CONNECTED WITH ANOTHER HINDU IDEA REINCARNATION THE TRANSMIGRATION OF THE SOUL THROUGH A SERIES OF MANY LIVES USING AN ANALOGY IF I GET A SPEEDING TICKET BUT I CLAIM THAT I HAVE SINCE SOLD A CAR INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT DOES THAT MEAN I CAN GET OFF THE PENALTY
NO THE LIABILITY STILL LIES WITH ME THE DRIVER NOT THE VEHICLE SIMILE THE VEDIC TEXTS SAY KHANNA CONSEQUENCES REMAIN WITH ME AS THE SOUL EVEN THOUGH I HAVE LONG SINCE DEPARTED FROM THE BODY WHICH I COMMITTED THE CRIME
AND KARMA OFFERS NO EXCUSE FOR INACTION IN THIS LIFE IN HINDU TERMS THE STATE HAS ITS OWN COMIC RESPONSIBILITY TO FULFIL ITS DUTY AND PROVIDE PROTECTION ADJUSTERS SO THE WRONG AND HER TO VICTIMS IS MITIGATED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND THIS WAS THE INTENTION IN THE OMAGH CASE MICHAEL GALLAGHER THE FATHER OF ONE OF THE VICTIM SAID ON TUESDAY
BARRING A ROAD TO DAMASCUS CONVERSION AND THE CONFESSION THOSE BEHIND THE OMAGH BOMB PLOT HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IT I BELIEVE THAT THE SENSE OF A JUST UNIVERSE IS DEEP IN MANY HEARTS AND SO ALSO IS THE SOUL'S RELATED NEED FOR CONFESSION AND ABSOLUTION
SOME DAY WE MIGHT HEAR SUCH AN ADMISSION AND THAT WOULD BE FAR BETTER THAN LEAVING IT TO THE MYSTERIOUS AN INEXORABLE PROCESSORS OF KARMA TO BALANCE IT ALL OUT
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH I CAN DADDY DUST THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT THE FRENCH ARE STILL GOING TO WANT TO CARRY ON SELLING US THEIR WINE THE GERMANS ARE STILL GOING TO WANT TO CARRY ON SELLING US THEIR B.M.W.S EVEN IF WE QUIT THE YOU THAT HAS BEEN THE ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD BY THOSE WHO WANT US TO LEAVE ALL THE MORE INTERESTING THEN THAT THE BOSSES OF B.M.W. HAVE JUST SENT A LETTER TO THEIR WORKERS WARNING THEM OF THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE U.K. VOTING FOR BRICKS IT
B.M.W. REMEMBER DOESN'T JUST MANUFACTURE ENGINES HERE BUT IT ALSO OWNS THE FACTORIES THAT MAKES MINIS AND MAKE ROLL ROYCE'S AS WELL IAN ROBINSON JOINS US FROM THEIR LONDON OFFICES HE'S HEAD OF SALES AND MARKETING FOR B.M.W. SITS ON THE GROUP'S MAIN BOUGHT MORNING TO YOU MISTER ROBERTSON OIL DOWN THIS LETTER FOR US ARE YOU SAYING AS THE GUARDIAN THAT'S BEEN GIVEN A LETTER CLAIMS WILL GET HIGHER COS HIGHER PRICES AND FEWER JOBS
THE LETTER WAS IN RESPONSE TO A LOT OF QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING FROM OUR EMPLOYEES ON AIM IN THE FACTORY
WHAT WE'VE SAID IS THAT OVER THE LAST SORT OF TEN YEARS OR SO WE'VE INVESTED VERY HEAVILY AS YOU QUITE RIGHTLY SAID IN YOUR INTRODUCTION WE ARE EXPORTING AROUND EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR MINIS AND A ROLLS ROYCE IS FROM THIS COUNTRY BUT I THINK VERY IMPORTANTLY WE ENJOY THE FREE MOVEMENT OF VEHICLES THE FREE MOVEMENT OF COMPONENTS AND VERY VERY IMPORTANTLY THE FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR
TO SUPPORT OUR FACTORIES AROUND EUROPE THAT'S WHY I ASK YOU JUST TO SPELL OUT WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY WARNING OF ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE COST OF YOUR CARS WILL GO UP ARE YOU SAYING THAT FEWER BRITISH PEOPLE WILL HAVE JOBS IF WE LEAVE THE
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT AT ALL AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY POINTING OUT IS ALL THE ADVANTAGES THAT WE ENJOY AND FORGIVE ME WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR LET ME JUST VOTE PUT THOSE ALLEGED ADVANTAGES PERSPECTIVE FROM ROLLS ROYCE THERE ARE SOME TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EUROPEAN CITIZENS WHO WORK WITHIN ROLLS ROYCE THERE ARE SEVENTEEN NATIONALITIES WITHIN OUR OXFORD PLANT SO WE BUILT A BUSINESS ON A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION MARKET CALLED THE E. U.
I THINK THAT IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS THAT WE WISH TO TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD SUI AGREEING WITH STUART ROSE WHO WERE YOU KNOW LEADS THE BRITAIN STAYING IN THE AIR YOU CAMP THAT LABOUR COSTS WOULD GO UP IF WE WERE TO LEAVE
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT AT ALL WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE MOMENT IS POINTING OUT WHAT'S GOOD WHAT THE ADVANTAGES ARE WHAT BRITAIN WINS FROM BEING PART OF THE FORGIVE ME WHAT I'M STRUGGLING TO WORK OUT THAT WAS WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN YOU TRY AND BOIL IT DOWN WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THEN THE YOU'LL HAVE FEWER WORKERS FROM ABROAD ABLE TO MANUFACTURERS
THAT IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED WE POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS A VERY STRONG PLUS WE'VE ALSO POINTED OUT ONE OF THOSE SEEN AS A PLUS FORGIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING BUT MIND BE THIS FOR A PLUS IF YOU'RE BRITISH WORKER ONTO YOUR BRITISH JOB IN ROLLS ROYCE YOU MIGHT THINK TREMENDOUS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPORT MORE CHEAP LABOUR YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT
CHEAP LABOUR AND THAT SORT OF THING BECAUSE WE'RE A VERY SKILLED INTERNATIONAL WORKFORCE AND BY THE WAY I'M A BRIT WORKING IN GERMANY ALONG WITH MANY MANY OTHERS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE WE ARE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS BRITAIN IS AN INTERNATIONAL TRADING NATION
BRITAIN IS PLAYING A VERY SIGNIFICANT ROLE I THINK WITHIN THE E.U. AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE WISH TO CONTINUE TO SEE MOVING FORWARD NOW BRITAIN EXPORTS MANY MORE CARS SORRY IMPORTS WE BUY MANY MORE CARS FROM THE AIR YOU THEN WE EXPORT TO IT SO ISN'T IT EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE IN EUROPE'S INTEREST TO HAVE A FREE TRADE DEAL WITH US BECAUSE AS I SAID IN THE INTRODUCTION THEY WILL WANT TO CARRY ON SELLING US B.M.W.S
WE WE EXPORT ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY MANUFACTURE HERE SO FOR PERSPECTIVE THE BALANCES THE OTHER WAY ROUND BUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN POST TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE RESULT THERE ARE MANY MANY POSSIBILITIES BUT THE ONE THING THAT YOU WOULD SAY ALSO IS THAT THERE WOULD BE A TIME OF UNCERTAINTY
AND WHEN WE MAKE INVESTMENTS FOR MANY MANY YEARS IN INTO THE FUTURE WE LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE LANDSCAPE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND UNCERTAINTIES ARE HELPFUL WELL CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I THINK THAT THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND B.M.W.S IMPORTED FROM THE CONSTANT TO THE U.K. AND YOU EXPORT AROUND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MINIS
TO THE U.K. SO THE BALANCE IS IN THE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONTINENT ISN'T IT AND THEREFORE THERE'S EVERY REASON TO THINK THAT YOUR GERMAN PARENT BOARD WOULD LOBBY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT TO SAY GIVE BRITAIN A FREE TRADE DEAL I THINK THERE ARE MANY MANY POSSIBILITIES BUT IN BETWEEN
THERE IS THIS UNCERTAINTY AND THAT IS WHAT WE ENJOY AT THE MOMENT THE FREE MARKET WE ENJOY THE POTENTIAL OF THAT AND WE ENJOY BUILDING OUR VEHICLES HERE AND EXPORTING THEM TO THE Y. U. AND AROUND THE WORLD BUT YOU HAVE AN AMERICAN FACTORY EVER RUSSIAN FACTORY THEY'RE NOT IN THE E.U. THEY DO PERFECTLY WELL
WE DO HAVE FACTORIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD AS YOU QUITE RIGHTLY SAY WE MANUFACTURE AND WE SELL VEHICLES WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES AS WELL BUT BRITAIN IS ACTUALLY PLAYING A GOOD ROLL A STRONG ROLE IN THE YOU AS WELL
JUST A BRIEF I KNOW ONE BRIEF IF YOU WOULD PLEASE YOU SEE YOU'RE NOT SAYING HIGHER PRICES AND YOU'RE NOT SAYING FEWER JOBS YOU SEE MERELY TO BE SAYING WELL WE JUST CAN'T BE SURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE LEAVE I THINK THOSE UNCERTAINTIES ARE DEFINITELY AND WE WANT TO ACTUALLY BUILD ON THE SUCCESS THE BRITAIN HAS REVITALISED IT'S CAR INDUSTRY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BUILT ON OPEN BORDERS IAN ROBERTS IN A B.M.W. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND PHILIP FAVOURS HAVE THE WEATHER FORECAST A LITTLE MICHELLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU LESS OF THE DAY FOOT'S FORECAST WITH THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WALES AND THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND YOU'VE GOT ONE OR TWO SHOWERS AROUND AT THE MOMENT BUT THEY WILL FADE WITH TIME

FURTHER EAST ACROSS ENGLAND WELL IT'S A DRY ENOUGH START FOR MANY QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD AROUND AND THAT PRODUCE ONE OR TWO SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY GRADUALLY MIGRATING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER EASTWARDS WITH TIME I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S DRY AND THE TEMPERATURES IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT SEVEN TO TEN FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S A DRY ENOUGH START ONE OR TWO SHOWERS AROUND BUT MID AFTERNOON AT THE WEST WILL HAVE SEEN THE RAIN BY TEATIME ALL AREAS WILL HAVE SEEN THE SOME OF IT MODERATE OCCASIONALLY HEAVY PERHAPS SIX TO SEVEN DEGREES SHOULD COVER IT

NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND MIGRANTS REMAIN STUCK THERE HOPING TO CROSS THE CHANNEL

THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WILL FRAME TALKS BETWEEN PRESIDENT DOLLOND AND DAVID CAMERON NATIONAL SECURITY IS NOW FREQUENTLY CITED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A VITAL REASON FOR REMAINING IN THE E.U. AND TODAY'S SUMMIT IS A CHANCE TO HAMMER THAT MESSAGE HOME
THE FOREIGN HOME AND DEFENCE SECRETARIES WILL MEET THEIR FRENCH COUNTERPARTS HERE TOO BUT LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAVE SAID FREE MOVEMENT RULES LEAVE BRITAIN MORE EXPOSED TO A PARIS STYLE ATTACK AND WRITING IN THEIR SON BORIS JOHNSON SAYS IGNORE THE SCARE MONGERS WE ARE BIGGER BETTER AND GREATER THAN THEY PRETEND

HAS EMAILED IT'S U.K. STAFF TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT IT SEES AS THE RISKS OF A BRITISH EXIT BUT THE BOSSES OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED SMALL COMPANIES HAVE WRITTEN AN OPEN LETTER ABOUT THE DISADVANTAGES OF REMAINING IN THE Y.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK IS VISITING GREECE AND TURKEY TODAY AS HE TRIES TO FORGE A UNIFIED EUROPE WIDE APPROACH TO THEIR MIGRATION CRISIS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ARE STUCK IN GREECE WITH BORDERS FURTHER NORTH NOW CLOSE TO THEM A NEW ARRIVALS REACHED THE GREEK ISLANDS EVERY DAY A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS FROM THE ISLAND OF LESS WHAT
DONALD TUSK HAS BEEN TOURING CAPITAL CITIES IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE THIS WEEK TRYING TO EASE TENSIONS CAUSED BY THE MIGRATION CRISIS BUT NOTHING HE SAYS NOTHING THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES WILL MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE UNLESS THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ARRIVING ON THE GREEK ISLANDS STARTED TO FALL SIGNIFICANTLY
SO FAR THIS YEAR SOME SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY REACHED LES BOSS ALONE ON SMALL BOATS THAT SET OUT FROM THE TURKISH COAST SMUGGLING REMAINS A HUGELY LUCRATIVE BUSINESS AND THE DEMAND IS STILL HIGH BUT WHEN MY TUSKERS EMPHASISED THAT E.U. LEADERS MUST DO ALL THEY CAN TO SUMMIT NEXT MONDAY TO ENSURE THAT THEIR JOINT ACTION PLAN WITH TURKEY IS A SUCCESS THAT WILL DEPEND ABOVE ALL HE SAID IN A CLEAR AND SIGNIFICANT DROP IN ARRIVALS
IN REALITY THAT MEANS LESS THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE PER DAY GO TO THE KIND OF NUMBERS GREECE CAN WITH SOME HELP BEGIN TO COPE WITH FOR THE MOMENT THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS REMAINED STRANDED ON THE MACEDONIAN BORDER AND THOUSANDS MORE ARE SCATTERED AMONGST MAKESHIFT CAMPS IN ATHENS AND ELSEWHERE POLITICAL PROGRESS IS URGENTLY REQUIRED
PROSECUTORS IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE BEING TOLD THEY SHOULD CONSIDER CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST PEOPLE WHO SET UP FAKE SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILE'S THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE SAYS TOUGHER ACTION IS REQUIRED AGAINST PEOPLE WHO USE THEIR PROFILES TO THREATEN OR HARASS OTHERS ON TARGET IS PEOPLE TRYING TO HUMILIATE HER FORMER PARTNERS BY POSTING INTIMATE PICTURES SALAMI PRE HAYS FORMER BOYFRIEND DID THAT AND RECEIVED A SUSPENDED JAIL SENTENCE
I WAS DEVASTATED BECAUSE I NEVER THERE WAS PEOPLE IN WORK THAT I KNOW THAT'S SEEN AS PICTURES IN THERE WAS A MAN LIKE SAT ACROSS THE OFFICE FOR ME I KNOW HE THOUGHT THE PICTURES IT WAS HORRIBLE TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE QUITE SHAMEFUL EMBARRASSING REALLY
THIS IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF CHANGES TO GUIDELINES FOR PROSECUTORS WITH THE AIM OF KEEPING THEM UP TO DATE WITH MODERN CRIME THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS ALISON SAUNDERS TOLD US IT WAS RIGHT TO TAKE ACTION
WE ALL USE INTO INTERNET ALL THE TIME WE USE SOCIAL MEDIA ALL THE TIME IT IS A FANTASTIC TOOL WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO DO ANYTHING THAT'S A CHILLING EFFECT ON FREE SPEECH BUT WHERE IT'S USED FOR CRIME AND WEAR IT SERIOUSLY IMPACTING ON PEOPLE'S LIVES THEN THAT'S WHERE WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT IT AND LOOK AT WHETHER WE'VE HAD THE EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE
THE FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY WILL DELIVER A SPEECH THIS EVENING IN WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CRITICISE DONALD TRUMP BUT SOURCES SAY HE WON'T ENDORSE ANOTHER CANDIDATE MISTER TRUMP HAS CONSOLIDATED HIS POSITION AS THE FRONT RUNNER IN THE CONTEST WITH A STRING OF VICTORIES IN THE SUPER TUESDAY POLES ONE OF HIS RIVALS BEN CARSON HAS SIGNALLED THAT HE'S READY TO WITHDRAW FROM THE RACE
NORTH KOREA HAS LAUNCHED SEVERAL SHORT RANGE MISSILES INTO THE SEA I WAS AFTER THE UNITED NATIONS ANNOUNCED TOUGH SANCTIONS AGAINST THE COUNTRY THE MEASURES WERE PASSED IN RESPONSE TO RECENT NUCLEAR TESTS STEVE EVANS REPORTS FROM
THE FIRING WHICH DIDN'T THREATEN ANY TARGET OUTSIDE NORTH KOREA IS BEING SEEN IN SOUTH KOREA AS A GESTURE OF DEFIANCE ANNOYANCE AT THE PASSING OF THE VOTE FOR TOUGHER SANCTIONS AT THE UNITED NATIONS
NORTH KOREA'S MEDIA HAVE ALREADY MADE A FEROCIOUS VERBAL ATTACK ON SOUTH KOREA'S PRESIDENT CALLING HER A BAT WHICH LIVES IN A DINGY CARE
MANY NOW EXPECT ARE CRANKING UP OF TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IN THE WAKE OF THE UN RESOLUTION
THE SHORT RANGE MISSILES FIRED A PERMITTED UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT LONGER RANGE MISSILES WOULD NOT BE KNOW WHAT A FIFTH NUCLEAR TEST
SCIENTISTS ARE WARNING ABOUT THE DANGERS OF A NEW PLANT DISEASE WHICH COULD BE MORE DEVASTATING THAN ASH DIEBACK THE BACTERIA HAS ALREADY CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO PLANTS AND TREES IN THE U.S. AND SOUTHERN EUROPE AND COULD SOON ARRIVE IN THE U.K. ALEX DUNLOP REPORTS
THE STUDIOS ARE IS CARRIED BY INSECTS AND IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST HARMFUL PLANT PATHOGENIC BACTERIA IN THE WORLD FIRST CONFIRMED IN EUROPE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN HAD RAVAGED OLIVE TREES AND SOUTHERN ITALY IT'S SPREAD TO FRANCE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE WILTING DIEBACK AND SCORCHED LEAVES MANY TREES DIE
SHOULD REACH OUR SHORES THE IMPACT OF DESIRE ON THE HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRY COULD BE DEVASTATING UNLIKE ASH DIEBACK WHICH AFFECTS ONLY ASH TREES THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SPECIES OF PLANTS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE DISEASE INCLUDING SYCAMORE LAVENDER AND SOME ROSES
THE GOVERNMENT HAS IMPOSED A SO CALLED PLANT PASSPORT SCHEME FOR GROWERS AND RETAILERS THAT MEANS THAT ONLY PLANTS FROM DISEASE FREE AREAS ON THE CONTINENT CAN BE IMPORTED
A VICTORIAN GASOMETER WHICH STANDS NEXT TO THE OVAL CRICKET GROUND IN LONDON HAS BEEN PROTECTED FROM DEMOLITION GAS HOLDER NUMBER ONE HAD BEEN THREATENED BUT NOW HAS GRADE TWO LISTED STATUS ANTHONY VIRTUALLY REPORT
SINCE ITS CONSTRUCTION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY GAS HOLDER NUMBER ONE HAS STOOD LIKE A SENTINEL WATCHING OVER SOME OF CRICKET'S MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS FROM THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO VICTORY OF AUSTRALIA WHICH SPAWNED THE ASHES TO THE NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT TEST WHEN LEN HUTTON BROKE BRADMAN'S RECORD FOR THE MOST RUNS IN AN INNINGS HOWARD MARSHALL WAS COMMENTATING
THEY'RE BOTH BEEN HEARD IT WOULD SOUND LIKE THAT
AND ALL SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE BECAUSE SOME OF US THINKING
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S MAYBE HADN'T HAPPENED
NO LONGER RISES AND FALLS SOUNDS LIKE OTHER GASOMETER IS IT OUTLIVED ITS USE IT HAS BEEN UNDER THREAT OF DEMOLITION FOR MANY YEARS BUT NOW THE WROUGHT IRON STRUCTURE WILL BE PROTECTED HISTORIC ENGLAND HAS RECOMMENDED IT BE GIVEN GRADE TWO LISTED STATUS TO MARK ITS HISTORICAL TECHNICAL AND ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE LANDSCAPE
ANTHONY BUT ACTUALLY REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. COULD MEAN THE END OF BRITISH BORDER CHECKS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL THIS TIME THAT THREAT HAS NOT COME FROM THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN BUT FROM A FRENCH GOVERNMENT MINISTER EMANUEL MACKEREL THE ECONOMY MINISTER HAS TOLD THE FINANCIAL TIMES THE DAY THIS RELATIONSHIP UNRAVELS MIGRANTS WILL NO LONGER BE IN CALAIS IT ECHOES WHAT DAVID CAMERON SAID IN OCTOBER WHEN HIS RENEGOTIATION BID WAS STILL UNDERWAY
WE DO HAVE BORDERS AND BORDER CONTROLS IN THE WAY THAT SHOWING AND COUNTRIES GOAT AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO ASK YOURSELVES AS A COUNTRY AS WE GET TOWARDS THE END OF THIS RENEGOTIATION PROCESSES CAN WE GUARANTEE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE THE EXCELLENT JUXTAPOSED BORDER CONTROLS IN FRANCE THAT WE HAVE TODAY
YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T HAVE AN ADEQUATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN YOU KNOW I THINK IT'LL BE IMPORTANT POINT WELL TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER TRAVELS TO FRANCE FOR A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT ON AUNT WHO WAS TRYING TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THE JUNGLE CAMP IN CALAIS BY HAVING PART OF IT DEMOLISHED A CORRESPONDENT AND A HOLIC AND IS THIS MORNING AND WHAT IS IT LIKE TODAY ANNA
IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE MORNING HERE IN THE JUNGLE THE RIOT POLICE HAVE JUST ARRIVED THEY'RE CARRYING BATON GUNS SHIELDS AND THEIR BOOTS ARE COVERED IN PLASTIC BECAUSE OF THEIR
HORRIBLE WEATHER WE'VE BEEN HAVING IT'S BEEN TORRENTIAL RAIN AND THE GROUND IS EVEN MORE MUDDY THAN NORMAL YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR JUST IN FRONT OF ME THE DEMOLITION SQUADS HAVE JUST GOT TO WORK USING ANGLE GRINDERS TO BRING DOWN THESE WOODEN TARPAULIN STRUCTURES
AND THEY'RE MAKING VERY GOOD PROGRESS IT'S RELATIVELY CALM HERE IN THE JUNGLE TODAY COMPARED TO HOW IT'S BEEN EARLIER THIS WEEK IT'S SO VOLATILE AND ON MONDAY THOSE TENSIONS IGNITE THE PROTESTERS HERE SOME OF THE MIGRANTS WERE THROWING ROCKS AT THE POLICE AND THEY FIRED BACK WITH TEAR GAS AND THE GROUNDS THIS MUDDY FIELD AS LES SAID WITH THOSE TEAR GAS CANISTERS
IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS THERE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE STUCK ON THIS SPORT AND NO MATTER HOW MISERABLE IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY TO THE PORT THIS PLACE
REPRESENTS THEY BELIEVE THEIR BEST CHANCE OF MAKING IT TO THE U.K. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR SOMEONE HERE COMPLAINING THAT THERE RIGHT POLICE WON'T LET THEM GO TO THE TOILET ACTUALLY TO GET UP TO THE SITE WE WALKED THROUGH A TRAIL OF HUMAN EXCREMENT AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS PLACE HAS TO BE DEMOLISHED BECAUSE
OF THE UNSANITARY CONDITIONS BUT ALSO AS YOU SAID IT'S DESIGNED TO ACT AS A DETERRENT IN THE WHOLE ISSUE OF SECURITY IN THE MIGRANT CRISIS WE'LL BE FEATURING PROMINENTLY ON THE AGENDA WHEN DAVID CAMERON MEETS FRANCOIS LON DINNER MEANS HERE IN NORTHERN FRANCE LATER OR YOU MIGHT REMEMBER MICHELLE DAVID CAMERON HAS IN THE PAST WARNED
IF THE E. BUT IF THE U.K. WERE TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THEN DOVER COULD BECOME THE NEW CALAIS AND AT THE TIME HE WAS ACCUSED OF SCAREMONGERING YOU MIGHT HAVE READ THE COMMENTS BY BORIS JOHNSON THIS MORNING TOO
AND THE CAMPAIGNERS WHO ARE CAMPAIGNING FOR AN EXIT SAY THAT THE TREATY ALLOWS PRECEDENT TO CONDUCT CHECKS ON THE FRENCH SIDE OF THE CHANNEL IS ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT OF OF BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP HOWEVER THESE COMMENTS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES COMING FROM THE FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER THIS MORNING
WILL REALLY UP THE ANTE AHEAD OF THESE TALKS SO EMMANUEL MA CORONER'S YOU SAID SAYS THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES IN FAVOUR OF BRECHT'S IT'S THEN IT COULD BRING AN END TO THAT AGREEMENTS AND IN HIS WORDS THE DAY THIS RELATIONSHIP UNRAVELS THE MIGRANTS WILL NO LONGER BE HERE IN CALAIS
AND A HOLLER GO IN CALAIS THANK YOU WERE LISTENING TO THAT FROM WESTMINSTER IS BERNARD JENKIN THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. FOR HARWICH AND NORTH ESSEX WHO'S ON THE BOARD OF VOTE LEAVE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND THOSE COMMENTS FROM EMMANUEL AND MACKEREL ARE A WARNING TO VOTERS IN THE U.K. ABOUT THE POTENTIAL RISKS ALL SURPRISE SURPRISE EVERY TIME THE PRIME MINISTER OR GEORGE OSBORNE IS EVER GOING TO MEET ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT WE HAD IT FROM GEORGE OSBORNE AT THE G. TWENTY LAST WEEK WHEN HE
GOT THEM TO PUT SOMETHING INTO THE COMMUNICATING THAT WAS APPARENT DESIGNED TO SCARE US ABOUT LEAVING THE E.U. THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN ALL THE TIME I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE QUOTE FROM THE FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER BERNARD CANNAS A CASANOVA WHO SAID JUST LAST MONTH CALLING FOR THE BORDER WITH THE ENGLISH TO BE OPENED IS NOT A RESPONSIBLE SOLUTION IT WOULD SEND A SIGNAL TO PEOPLE SMUGGLERS AND WOULD LEETLE WOULD LEAVE MIGRANTS TO FLOW TO KALLIE IN FAR GREATER NUMBERS
A HUMANITARIAN DISASTER WOULD ENSUE IF YOU SAY FOOLHARDY PATH AND ONE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PURSUE NOW YOU SEE THAT IS THE GENUINE LYING TO TAKE FROM THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT WHAT WE'RE HAVING NOW IS PROPAGANDA BEING PRODUCED BY OTHER EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AT THE REQUEST OF THE PRIME MINISTER TO TRY AND SCARE PEOPLE INTO VOTING LET YOU BURNT BERNARD CASANOVA ALSO SAID IN IN THERE AT THE SAME POINT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WILL ALWAYS RESULT IN COUNTER MEASURES AND YOU CANNOT RULE OUT
THE PROSPECT OF THE FRENCH IN THE AFTERMATH OF A VOTE TO LEAVE TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS BILATERAL AGREEMENT THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE BRITISH AND THINKING YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE WE WANT TO DO THIS YEAH I JUST DON'T THINK RESPONSIBLE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO CUT OFF THEIR NOSES TO SPITE THEIR FACES JUST BECAUSE WE VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. IT IS OBVIOUSLY THE SAFER THING FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM
TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OVER OUR BORDERS OVER OUR LAWS OVER THE MONEY THAT WE SENT TO THE E.U. BECAUSE THEN WE CAN CONTROL OUR RELATIONS WITH OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS AT THE MOMENT ALL THIS IS IN THE END SUBJECT TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE FOR EXAMPLE WE MAY NOT BE IN THE SHAMAN AGREEMENT BUT WE ARE BOUND BY THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE MOVEMENT ALL THESE E.U. MIGRANTS COMING INTO ALL THESE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE E.U. FROM OUTSIDE THE E.U. WHEN THEY BECOME NATURALISED CITIZENS OF OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES THEY HAVE THE
ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO COME HERE BECAUSE THEY BECOME E.U. CITIZEN ON WE CAN'T CONTROL THAT ON THIS SPECIFIC POINT ABOUT THE AGREEMENT THAT ENABLES A BRITISH FORCES BRITISH THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES TO CHECK PASSPORTS ET-CETERA AND TO CHECK THE BACK OF LORRIES ON THE FRENCH SIDE OF THE BORDER
PETER RICKETTS IS A FORMER AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE A FORMER BUSES FINALLY HAD IT WELL AT THE TIME TO EAT WELL BUT THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL POET AND THAT THIS IS A PERSON WHO SAYS IF BRITAIN NEEDS THE E.U. I THINK IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT FRANCE WOULD REVIEW ITS POSITION AS WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE IN THE MESS WERE ENGLISH BECAUSE WE HAVE DIPLOMATS WHO HAVE RELIGIOUSLY AND SLAVISHLY PURSUED THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION
POLICY AND ACTUALLY IT'S THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET A SALE WITH THIS NOT EX DIPLOMATS LIKE PETER RICKETTS I GOT A GREAT REAL RESPECT FOR HIM HE'S A GREAT PUBLIC SERVANT BUT THEY ALL HAVE A CERTAIN VIEW AND THEY ARE NOW AND IT'S INTERESTING AS SOON AS THEY RETIRE
THEY TURN OUT TO HAVE THIS VERY PRO EUROPEAN VIEW I'M AFRAID OUT I THINK IT RATHER DISCREDITS THE IDEA THAT WE'VE GOT AN IMPARTIAL DIPLOMATIC SERVICE BUT EVEN THOUGH WHAT HE IS SAYING IS THAT THAT THE REASON THAT THE FRENCH AND FORCE THIS IS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF ONE AGREEMENT IT'S BECAUSE THEY SEE BRITAIN AS A VERY IMPORTANT ALLY IN THE E.U. ON A WHOLE RANGE OF AREAS OF CO OPERATION AND THAT IS WHY THEY DO WHAT THEY DO SURPRISE SURPRISE WE PAY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY INTO THE E.U. AND IT SUBSIDISES A GREAT DEAL OF FRENCH FARMING
SURPRISE SURPRISE THEY DON'T WANT TO SLEEP BUT THIS IS A CHOICE FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE GOT FOR THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT NOT FOR THE RETIRED DIPLOMATS THEY HAVE ONE VOTE IN THIS EACH IN THIS IN THIS REFERENDUM AND ACTUALLY WE ARE BEING ASKED TO BELIEVE ALL SORTS OF LUDICROUS THINGS FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS PRETTY WELL FREE TRADE BETWEEN ICELAND AND THE RUSSIAN BORDER AND WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. SOMEHOW
ONE OF THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THIS AREA IS GOING TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THIS FREE TRADE AREA I MEAN THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BONKERS NONSENSE YOU DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS YOUR BIT WEALTH BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE WELL WHAT DOES ONE ADVOCATING IS UP A WHOLE NEW ERA THERE IS SO MUCH OF IT THAT THERE'S THEREFORE UNKNOWABLE WHAT WE'RE REPLICATING IS THAT WE SHOULD BE LIKE MOST OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT WE SHOULD CONTROL OUR LAWS WE SHOULD CONTROL HER OWN TRADING RELATIONS AND I WAS ONE OF THE
WHAT THE ONE OF THE LARGEST TRADING ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD WERE NOT GOING TO BE SWATTED AROUND LIKE A PING PONG BALL FOR GOODNESS SAKE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ARGUING ALL THESE FEARS ACTUALLY RUNNING THIS COUNTRY DOWN THEY THEY'RE THE PEOPLE THAT LACK CONFIDENCE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE A THRIVING ECONOMY AND YESTERDAY FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD STUART ROSE TELLING US OH DEAR WAGES MIGHT ACTUALLY GO UP IF WE LEAVE IT HE WHO I AM I MEAN THESE LITTLE TRUTHS ARE SLIPPING OUT WE'RE IN A FAR BIGGER BUSINESS
A FAR BIGGER AN ARGUMENT THAT THE SCARE STORIES SUGGEST SO THESE AND THESE THESE IRRESPONSIBLE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING OUT THESE SCARE STORIES THAT INCLUDES B.M.W. YES IT BE EIGHT THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN THE U.K. THE SAME PRICE THAT WE WOULD GET FREE TRADE RIGHT ANYONE ON THE SAME TERMS SURPRISED I USED TO WORK IN THE MOTOR INDUSTRY AND THE MOTOR INDUSTRY
HIGHLY AND ALMOST TOTALLY REGULATED BY THE E.U. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING CRITICAL OF THE B.M.W. IS NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING TO UPSET EITHER THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ALL THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SO SURPRISE SURPRISE GERMAN MULTINATIONAL SUPPORTS MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THE CASE BUT THE POINT IS THIS THIS IS IT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE DECIDED BY BUREAUCRATS AND BIG BUSINESS AND BIG BANKS WHO SPEND MONEY LOBBYING EACH OTHER AND GETTING IT AND SCRATCHING OTHERS BACKS THIS IS GOING TO BE STARTED BY THE PEOPLE AND THE REALLY INTERESTING THING IS
THE GOVERNMENT STOPPED TALKING ABOUT THE DEAL THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T SELL THE DEAL THEY KNOW IT'S A IT'S A TRIVIAL AND IRRELEVANT LITTLE SIDESHOW IT'S NOT TRANSFORMED THE POLES AS THEY HOPED AND NOW THEY'RE THROWING THE KITCHEN SINK AT ALL THESE SCARE STORIES AND TRYING TO GALVANISE COMPANIES AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO FRIGHTEN PEOPLE INTO VOTING TO REMAIN
THAT'S NOT WORKING EITHER THE POLES SIMPLY AREN'T MOVING BUT WHEN BUT I WILL BE AND WHAT YOU WHAT YOU CANNOT DENY WILL BE THE CASE IS THAT THERE WOULD BE A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY AFTER ANY VOTE WELL I DON'T THAT'S WHAT B. AND DO YOU WORK ON THE TODAY PROGRAMME IN A MOMENT TO GO IS THERE AS THE BIGGEST RISK HE WOULD YOU WORK ON THE TODAY PROGRAMME EVERY GENERAL ELECTION THERE'S A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT UNCERTAINTY IT'S MOST TREASURED YOU WON'T THERE'S JUST NO POINT MOST MOST CUT THEIR COUNTRIES
I'M NOT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY SELL STUFF TO THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU KNOW THE UNITED STATES IS ABOUT TO OVERTAKE THE TIGHTY KINGDOM AS AN EXPORTER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE EUROPEAN UNION IS NO LONGER OUR BIGGEST MARKET WERE EXPANDING OUR MARKETS ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD MUCH FASTER THAN WE ARE OUR EXPORTS TO THE EUROPEAN UNION THIS IS IT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE U.K. TO TAKE BACK CONTROL
OVER WHAT IS OUR BIRTHRIGHT IT WHAT IS WHAT WHAT ANY DEMOCRACY WOULD USUALLY CONSIDER TO BE ITS RIGHT TO CONTROL ITS OWN LAWS TO CONTROL ITS OWN TAXPAYERS' MONEY AND THE REST OF EUROPE WILL ADAPT AND MAYBE IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNIT IT'LL BE THE WAKE UP CALL THAT THEY NEED TO SORT OUT THEIR PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE'VE CLEARLY BEEN UNABLE TO INFLUENCE IT FROM WITHIN BERNARD JENKIN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH

THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHRIS IT'S A TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE SOME CALL IT A STREET SEX IT'S OFFICIALLY A MANAGED AREA FOR PROSTITUTES TO WORK IN THE CITY OF LEEDS AND IT'S BEEN IN OPERATION SINCE LATE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITH THE AGREEMENT OF BOTH THE POLICE AND THE COUNCIL ITS AIM IS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE POLICE AND SEX WORKERS TO ENCOURAGE THEM OF COURSE TO REPORT ANY PROBLEMS THEY MAY HAVE
BUT A FORMER DETECTIVE WHO LED THE RESPONSE TO THE MASS MURDER OF STREET SEX WORKERS IN SUFFOLK SAYS THIS IS PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE ABUSERS WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY ALAN KAITEN WHO IS A FORMER DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT SUFFOLK POLICE AND ALSO BY DOCTOR BELINDA PROPS GORDON READER IN PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY WHO'S HERE WITH US FROM BIRKBECK UNIVERSITY OF LONDON MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING WHAT IS IT THAT WORRIES YOU ALAN
WELL QUITE FRANKLY AGENCIES ARE ALLOWING PROSTITUTION TO GO ON UNFETTERED WHERE WOMEN ARE BEING ABUSED AND EXPLOITED BY MEN WHO CHOOSE TO USE THEM I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND I THINK IT I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THAT THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE DONE THIS WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THE ABUSE THAT PROSTITUTION CAUSES AND PARTICULARLY WHEN I LOOK BACK ON THIS MATTER WAS DISCUSSED WHEN I WAS A SERVING OFFICER GET GOING BACK ABOUT A DECADE
IT WAS AND IT WAS THEN THOUGHT THAT THAT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO OPERATE THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE A CHANGE IN THE LAW ACTUALLY WALKS DE PLACE TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL QUE DISCRETION CHIEF CONSTABLES DO NOT POSSESS THE DISCRETION IS A MATTER OF POLICY TO DISPENSE WITH AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT I SO WANT MORE TO DO WHAT
IN ORDER TO EFFECT A MANAGED QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A DID DIS DISREGARD OF THE CRIMINAL LAW THAT THE POLICE ARE THERE TO UNDERTAKE SO ALLOWING ALLOWING WOMEN TO BE ABUSED AND EXPLOITED ON THE STREET IN SUCH ZONES WHEN THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THE ZONE TO WORK MANY PLACE AND IN ANY EVENT DOCTOR BROOKS GORDON WHAT THEN HE'S THE REASON FOR HAVING THESE SORTS OF ZONES AND IS WRONG TO SAY THAT THEY ARE MERELY ENCOURAGING A BEAST
NOT AT ALL IT'S DANGEROUS NONSENSE TO SAVE ENCOURAGING ABUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MURDERS A SEX WORKER SINCE NINETEEN NINETY AND ARE BY ANY HARM REDUCTION MEASURE YOU WOULD CONSIDER ZONES BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN ONE MURDER
IN A DECADE OF VARIOUS SOUNDS BEING USED AND I THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS OF MISTER KATE AND TO SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND SIX A CLAMP DOWNS IN SIX MAJOR CITIES OF WHICH ONE WITH IPSWICH I PUT A PAPER ON
FACEBOOK THIS MORNING HAVE A CONFERENCE PAPER REPRESENTED IN MARCH OF THAT YEAR SAYING HOW DANGEROUS THEY CLAMP DOWNS WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE CITIES WAS IPSWICH AND SON WE SAID THERE'D BE BLOOD ON THE STREETS AND SADLY THERE WAS A NOVEMBER SO MY CAPE AND SEEMS TO BE MAKING A SECOND CAREER OUT OF THEM STAKED MADE IN HIS FIRST CAREER
QUITE A CHARGE THAT MY NEW CLAMPDOWN LET'S IT'S TOTAL MISINFORMATION AND MYTHS THAT BELINDA BROOKS GORDON TRIES TO DISPEL YOU NO I MEAN IT'S ACTUALLY THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A CRACKDOWN IN IPSWICH PRIOR TO ALL OF THIS AND WHAT WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT HERE IS THE SAFETY OF WOMEN JUST GOING TO GO ON ABOUT THIS AND BRUNO I WANTED THAT BEFORE YOU BROUGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE WILL BE TIME I PROMISE YOU SHE MADE A VERY SERIOUS CHARGE YOU'RE SAYING IT'S RUBBISH LADDER JUST COME BACK HE SAID THERE WASN'T
WHERE WE KNOW THERE WAS IN GOVERNMENT STRATEGY I WAS THERE BUT I'M GOING TO TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND ONE AND PEOPLE SAID AND MY CAKE IN PARTICULAR SAID THAT THINGS HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE STREETS IN SUFFOLK WELL I WAS ALSO A CANDIDATE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND AND THE PITCH TO ME DOING LITTER PICKS AT RED LODGE TRUCK STOP SHOWING CONDOMS AND
AND NEEDLES WE KNOW THAT IT'S THERE WAS DISPLACEMENT WAS BENIGN DISPLACEMENT WHERE SOME WOMEN WENT OUT TO SEX IT WAS MALIGNANT DISPLACEMENT IT MADE THINGS A LOT LESS SAFE LET'S COMMIT TO GETTING CHANCE FOR A PARTNER AT THE BACK THERE THAT'S A TOTAL MYTH NICK THAT THEIR WORK IN IPSWICH OBVIOUSLY AFTER THE TRAGIC MURDERS OF A FIVE YOUNG WOMEN LEAD AGENCIES TO LOOK AT PROSTITUTION IN A IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY
AND ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO HOPEFULLY WOULDN'T COME ON TO LATER HOW WE NEED TO CHANGE THE LAW HERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING IT'S INCOHERENT BUT IPSWICH LOOKED AT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND YOU KNOW WE WORK TOGETHER COHESIVELY WE TACKLED THE DEMAND IT WAS KEY TO TACKLE THE DEMAND OF MEN WHO ABUSED AND EXPLOITED THESE WOMEN WHO WERE VULNERABLE ON THE STREETS ADDICTED TO DRUGS
WORKING IN AN AREA WHERE THEY WERE CLEARLY UNSAFE ME PROSTITUTION CANNOT EVER BE MADE SAFE AND HAS BEEN VERY MUCH IN ISN'T IT IN A WAY THAT WE SHOULD JUST END ON HUNTED WHICH IS DOES THE LAW HAVE TO BEHAVE AS IF IN YOUR VIEW DOCTOR BROOKS GORDON IN TRUTH YOU CAN NEVER ELIMINATE THIS TRADE YOU HAVE TO MANAGE IT YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE OR SHOULD YOU TRY
TO CRACK DOWN AND ELIMINATED ALL THE EVIDENCE FROM THE B.M.J. TO LANCET WORLD HEALTH AUTHORITY MEDICAL STANDARDS OF EVIDENCE BY WHICH I JUDGE PROPER EVIDENCE SAY YES THE HARM REDUCTION WAY IS THE ONLY WAY MY CAKE YOU THINK YOU COULD USE THE LAW DO YOU LOUIS LEMON ABSOLUTELY I DO THINK WE SHOULD BE USING THE LAW I THINK THE LAW CURRENTLY IS INCOHERENT IT'S NOT APPLIED EQUALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE'VE SEEN HER MANAGE ZONE THAT PETE MY BILLINGS IF YOU'D LET ME FINISH PLEASE
IF YOU GO WE HAVE A MANAGER ZONE IN LEEDS WHERE IT WHERE A YOUNG TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD YOUNG WOMAN WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED IN AN AREA WHICH WAS ALLEGEDLY THERE TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND WE'RE STILL SAYING THAT THAT WAS A SUCCESSFUL PILOT IT WAS A CATASTROPHIC FILE WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN END THE DEMAND THAT FUELS THIS EXPLOITATIVE AND VULNERABLE TRIED BRIEF LAST WORD FROM YOU DOCTOR BROOKS GORDON HE SAYS THE EXAMPLE IN LEEDS IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A MURDER PROVES THAT YOU CAN NEVER KEEP IT SAFE THAT WAY
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT ARE MANY PAY FOR SEX PAY OTHER MEN FOR SEX A MYSTIC AIDAN'S VERY GENDERED TAKE ON THE SITUATION ILLUSTRATES THAT HE'S ONLY LOOKING AT ONE ASPECT SADLY AND IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE ERADICATED IT IS MORE HUMANE AND SAFER AND MORE EVIDENCE BASED IN ORDER TO ALLOW
SAFETY ZONES ARE NOT A PANACEA DECRIMINALISATION AND OTHER POLICIES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD SHOWS THERE ARE BETTER WAYS LIKE NEW ZEALAND THIS IS A DEBATE I SENSE FOR YOU VOWED ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE AND WILL NO DOUBT HAVE AGAIN THANK YOU HAVING YOU WITH US ON THE PROGRAMME TODAY ALAN KATE AND DOCTOR BROOKS

HAS BORDERS FURTHER NORTH ARE CLOSED TO THEM MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE NOW STUCK IN GREECE TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT ON EARTH WILL HAPPEN NEXT FROM ATHENS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS
IF EUROPE'S RESPONSE TO THE MIGRATION CRISIS APPEARS TO BE ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE THEN
THIS FEELS LIKE GROUND ZERO I'M AT THE BLUE STAR FERRY TERMINAL IN THE PORT OF PARIAHS IN ATHENS
THERE ARE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE SLEEPING UNDER TREES UNDER THE TAIL GATES OF STATIONARY LORRIES THERE'S A LONG LINE OF WASHING HANGING UP OUTSIDE THE TICKET OFFICE AND THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF SMALL
LESS OF A BALLET THAT A FULL ABSOLUTELY CULLODEN EXHIBIT THIS IS FREDDO HE'S FROM SYRIA HE'S BEEN HERE WITH HIS FAMILY
ABOUT A WEEK NOW HE SAYS NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON SOME PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO GET UP TO MACEDONIAN BORDER AND BEEN TURNED BACK
HE TOOK THE SMUGGLERS HE SAYS AND MAY LIE TO YOU EVERYBODY LIES TO YOU

AND THERE ARE GRINNING FACES ALL ROUND ISLAND

SAMMY HAS JUST ARRIVED ON THIS LATEST FERRY
HE'S A DOCTOR
WHERE ARE YOU GETTING YOUR INFORMATION
FROM OF OFFENSIVE ZIGGO BEFORE OURS AND FROM ZOLA'S THEY DON'T FANCY LEVEL
AND NOW YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FOR SOME WAY TO GET TO GERMANY
RIGHT
THE OTHER
WELL THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION NOW HAS PLANS TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF EUROS HERE IN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE
AND OFFICIALS INSIST THE SYSTEM IS SLOWLY GETTING BETTER BUT THESE ARE VULNERABLE PEOPLE
NICOTINE IS FROM THE U.N. REFUGEE AGENCY ADMITS THAT THAT'S A REAL CONCERN
INTO THE HANDS OF SMUGGLERS UNDER OF THE NORTH THE PREDICT THEIR DISCORD
WE NEED TO PAY THEM CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY
LEGAL ORGANISED AND I GUESS IF OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DON'T HELP
THEN THEY'LL FALL PREY TO SMUGGLERS AGAIN
ALBANIA OR VILE WHICHEVER ROUTE PEOPLE FINE
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO FACE IN A BIT BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE HERE WHICH IS THE NUMBER
WE'VE MOVED INTO THE CENTRE OF TOWN THIS IS VICTORIA SQUARE IT TOO IS FULL OF PEOPLE MANY FROM AFGHANISTAN AND UNTIL
A FEW WEEKS AGO THE AFGHANS WERE ALLOWED TO CROSS THE BORDER INTO MACEDONIA AND HEAD NORTH NOT ANY MORE
MY NAME IS SAMMY AND YOU'RE FROM GAZA IN AFGHANISTAN YEAH HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING
LANGUAGE WHEN WE PLANNED
ONE MONTH ONE MONTH YEAH WASN'T OBVIOUS WHEREAS THE TAMBAQUI COUNTED
YOU GO BACK TO AFGHANISTAN YEAH YOU HAVE TO
NINETEEN YEARS OLD ME STAYING IN ONE OF THE LOCAL CAMP SET UP BY THE GREEK GOVERNMENT HE KNOWS THAT IN THE STREETS AROUND HERE THERE ARE SMUGGLERS WHO WILL OFFER YOU ALTERNATIVE ROUTES
BUT HE THINKS IT'S JUST TOO RISKY THAT'S DANGEROUS NO I DON'T WANT TO GO WITH THEIR SON IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR US SO FOR NOW YOU WAIT
THIS IS ALI ALSO FROM AFGHANISTAN THERE ARE SMUGGLERS WHO OFFERED AN IDLER TAKE YOU TO EUROPE
EXPENSIVE DONE THE PUPIL GIVE DINNER THREE DULLER THAN USUAL WEREN'T THERE PEOPLE HAVE MORE MONEY THEY WERE THEY WERE
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO'S GONE WITH SMUGGLERS NO EVERYONE'S WAITING FOR THE BORDER TO OPEN WATER MY FRIENDS ARE WAITING FOR THE WORD THIS
SO UNCERTAINTY RAINS AND MANY PEOPLE COULD BE STUCK HERE FOR SOME TIME
ONE THING WE'VE SEEN BEFORE AND WE WILL SEE AGAIN IF ONE MIGRATION
ONE ESCAPE ROUTE CLOSES DOWN ANOTHER OPENS UP
JUST A CASE OF WHERE I'M GOING
THAT WAS CHRIS MORRIS REPORTING JUST REMINDED THAT SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN HEARING THIS MORNING ARE ALSO AVAILABLE AS VIDEO RADIO WITH PICTURES MATTHEW PRICES EXPLAIN WHAT THE MOBILE PHONE TELLS US ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. AND OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT THE LATEST ANIMATION IS EXTRAORDINARY DIARIES OF LIFE IN RAKKA UNDER THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THEY WANT TO FIND THEM YOU GO TO A WEB PAGE B.B.C. DOT CODE U.K. SLASH TW
THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE FOR YEARS THE NATIONAL GALLERY AND THE TATE HAVE HAD A WRITTEN AGREEMENT WHICH SAYS THAT CIRCA NINETEEN HUNDRED IS THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN THE REMIT OF THE TWO BUT THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY GABRIELLA FINN ALDI HAS NOW SAID
IT COULD THINK ABOUT MOVING TOWARDS THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND POTENTIALLY COLLECTING PICTURES FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES WILL GONE POETS ARE ARTS EDITOR JOINS US NOW FROM SALFORD AND WILL USED TO WORK AT THE AT THE TATE IS THIS A LAND GRAB BY THE NATIONAL GALLERY NO IT'S AN AIR OF TENSION WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS SINCE GOES BACK TO ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHERE NEXT ROTA DID A DEAL WITH NEIL MACGREGOR
DREW THIS REALLY THIS FALSE WALL AT NINETEEN HUNDRED BECAUSE THE THING IS NOTHING STOPPED ALL STARTED IN NINETEEN HUNDRED ART CERTAINLY DIDN'T STOP THE TWO GALLERIES AND TRUTH HAVE BEEN BLURRING THE LINE THAT FOR YEARS TAKE DID A GAUGUIN SHOW FOR EXAMPLE A BIG GAUGUIN I KNOW HE'S SQUARELY A NINETEENTH CENTURY ARTIST
NATIONAL GALLERY ON THE OTHER HAND HAD A PROGRAMME OF CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE BECAUSE A FEELY PAINTING THERE JUST LAST YEAR SO THEY HAVE BEEN SORT OF PLAYING AROUND THE EDGES AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS YOU GET CERTAIN ARTISTS I SUPPOSE LIKE PICASSO PARTICULARLY LIKE CEZANNE WHO BRIDGE THE TWO BRIDGES SO THE CLASSIC ERA AND THE MODERN ERA IF EITHER GALLERY WANTS TO PROPERLY TELL THE STORY OF ART WHICH THEY DO OF COURSE
THEN THEY NEED TO CONFRONT THAT FOR EXAMPLE TAKE YOU WOULD IMAGINE WOULD BE SHOWING CUBISM PICASSO AND BRAQUE ZE GREAT INNOVATIONS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY CUIT KEEPERS AND SIMPLY COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT
SO IF THE NATIONAL GALLERY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE LEGACY OF THIS OUT AND THEN THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT CUBISM WHICH MEANS THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT PICASSO AND THEN YOU GET INTO EXPRESSIONISM WHICH WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT VAN GOGH WHO SITS IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY BUT ALL THE EXPRESSIVE AT THE LATEX EXPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS ARE IN THE TAPE SO REALLY FROM A PUBLIC POINT OF VIEW
INTEREST FOR UNDERSTANDING ART HISTORY AND REALLY GETTING INVOLVED WITH HER STORIES YOU DO NEED TO WORK ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LINE AND TO BE HONEST I THINK THE GALLERIES ARE DONE THAT REASONABLY WELL AS CEZANNE SAID WHEN HE WAS PAINTING BECAUSE HE WAS A GREAT INNOVATOR AT THE TIME ALL HE'S DOING IS ADDING ANOTHER LINK
TO THE CHAMBER SO YOU SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING NOT JUST THAT NINETEEN HUNDRED HAD BEEN ARTIFICIAL LINE BUT ACTUALLY IT WOULD BE PRETTY HARD TO TO DRAW THIS LINE ANYWHERE AND YET DO YOU HAVE TO DRAW IT SOMEWHERE IN ORDER FOR IT FOR THERE TO BE A COHERENCE FOR PEOPLE VISITING AND A DISTINCT REMIT FOR A COLLECTION NO YOU HAVE TO DRAW IT FOR FOR A COMMERCIAL REASON BECAUSE IF BOTH GALLERIES ARE FIGHTING AFTER THE SAME PICTURES TO GO INTO THEIR COLLECTIONS IS GOING TO DRIVE UP THE PRICE
AND THAT DOESN'T WORK AND SO THAT'S THE REASON BEHIND THE ANXIETY OF BOTH GALLERY DIRECTORS IS NOT NECESSARILY TELLING THE STORY BECAUSE BOTH GALLERIES ALREADY LEND EACH OTHER'S PICK EACH OTHER PICTURES SO THEY CAN TELL THE NARRATIVE WHAT THEY WANT TO WANT TO PRESENT TO THE PUBLIC BUT IF THEY BOTH FIGHT FOR A PICASSO THAT PRICE IS GOING TO GO UP AND THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR THE CONSUMER US THE TAXPAYER AT ALL WHO'LL BE FOOTING THE BILL AND SAME APPLIES TO GOING FOR GOOD
BUT IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT THE NATIONAL GALLERY ONLY SHOWS PAINTINGS IT DOESN'T SHOW SCULPTURES AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SHOW INSTALLATION ART SO THAT THAT IS A COMPLETELY FREE REIGN FOR THE TATE AND IS ALSO WORTH YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE THINKING ABOUT
NEW YORK WHERE THE THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM AND THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART COEXIST QUITE HAPPILY AT WALKING COURSES BORDER WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM AT ALL WE'LL GONE BUT THANK YOU IT IS EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE ASK STUDENT WHETHER THEY'VE PAID THEIR T.V. LICENCE IN THERE PRETTY LIKELY TO SAY TO YOU WHY SHOULD I
I DON'T WATCH LIVE T.V. I WATCH EVERYTHING ON THE EYE PLAYER OR OTHER FORMS OF INTERNET DOWNLOAD WELL THERE ARE CHANGES ON THE WAY THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WETTING THEY'LL AS VOWED TO END THE SO CALLED LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO WATCH PROGRAMMES ON CATCH UP WITHOUT PAYING THE FEE THAT PAYS THE BILLS FOR THE B.B.C. WE'RE JOINED BY SCOTT BRIAN BUZZ FEEDS ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY FIND THE WHOLE IDEA OF PAY THE LICENCE FEE SO WE A PUZZLED OVER I MEAN IT
COMPLETELY MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE A T.V. LICENCE TO WATCH ANY CATCH UP SERVICES YOU NEED TO WATCH IT TO WATCH LIVE T.V. I KNOW QUITE A LOT OF MY FRIENDS
WHO HAVE JUST SORT OF GIVING UP HAVING A T.V. IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE NINETY NINE PERCENT OF EVERYTHING THAT THEY WATCH IS ON CATCH UP AND THEY'RE ALL THEY CAN JUST DELAY WATCHING MY MATTER OF SECONDS YES YES ABSOLUTELY THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING YEAH AND HOW MIGHT THIS WORK IF THE GOVERNMENTS AS WELL RIGHT IN FUTURE IF YOU GET YOUR EYE PAD OUT YOUR LAPTOP OR WHATEVER YOUR PHONE IN ORDER TO WATCH THE B. B. C. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A LICENCE FEE
WITH THE ENFORCER THE B. BECAUSE HE HAS ANNOUNCED THEIR PLANS BUT ONE WAY THAT I THINK IT COULD WORK IS YOU CAN LOOK INTO THE EYE PLAY USING YOUR B. B. C. I.D. AND I GUESS IF YOU PAY T.V. LICENCE THE T.V. LICENSING PEOPLE WILL GIVE YOU A CODE THEY YOU CAN ATTACH TO YOUR LOG IN SO YOU CAN JUST SORT OF GO TO THE I PLAYED YOU TO LOOK INTO THEIR SERVICES THE PROBLEM IS ANY PARENT COULD IT BE CONTACTED BY THEIR STUDENT CHILD BEING A BIT LIKE COULD I HAVE YOUR LOG IN
AND IT'S VERY HARD TO GO AND TRACE BY THE EYEPIECE SO THERE ARE WAYS THE I.P. ADDRESS OF COMPUTERS ARE ALWAYS HAVE RESTRICTED BUT IF YOU USE FOR EXAMPLE SKY OR VIRGIN SERVICES WHICH ALLOW YOU TO WATCH ON A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLD SCREENS YEAH ALWAYS TO LIMITED ON AND I THINK HE COULD SPEAK QUITE PROBLEMATIC THE IDEA OUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S A REALLY COMPLEX ISSUE IN THE OLD DAYS I THINK T.V. LICENSING USED TO BE QUITE A STRAIGHTFORWARD THING TO
CONTROL BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE A VAN THAT CAN MONITOR SIGNALS COMING IN NOW YOU ARE TRYING TO KIND OF CONTROLLED THE ENTIRE INTERNET AND PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO FIND A WAY TO GO AND WATCH THE SHOWS THAT THEY WANT TO BUT IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO A SERVICE LIKE THAT FLICKS OR AMAS AND BRIAN YOU HAVE A PASSWORD YES YOU CAN SHARE IT ABOUT A BIT BUT PASSWORDS THERE AH YES PATHWAYS THERE ARE BUT I MEAN I KNOW A LOT OF FRIENDS IS THAT ALL COMMON JOKE OF HAVING MULTIPLE PEOPLE NOT LOOKING INTO A NET FLICKS ACCOUNTS AT ONE TIME AND THAT IT'S A QUITE HAPPY FOR THIS TO BE THE WAY BECAUSE
YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY'RE STILL GETTING THERE SIX OR SEVEN POUNDS A MONTH WHAT MIGHT BE A WORRY FOR THE B. B. C. IN PURSUING A ROOTS IN WHICH YOU HAVE A PASSWORD EVEN IF IT'S NOT COMPLETELY SECURE I THINK THE MAIN THE MAIN ISSUE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE HAVING IS THAT THE B.B.C. HAVE REALLY SORT OF COMING OUT OF THEM AND AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK B. B. SEE WANT TO HAVE FOR YOU IS ON THEIR SIDE
I'D MAIL LOOK AND FEEL LIKE SUBSCRIPTION AS WELL EVEN IF IT ISN'T YES ABSOLUTELY I THINK THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE MUCH MORE OF A WAY TOWARDS SORT OF THE B. B. C. MAKING IT SEEM LIKE IT'S SUBSCRIPTION SCOT BRIAN BUT SWEET THANK YOU VERY MUCH NICK IT'S FIVE TO NINE THE PIANO PLAYED BY RALPH VAUGHAN WILLIAMS AS A CHILD IS ABOUT TO GO ON DISPLAY FOR THE FIRST TIME HE GREW UP IN SURREY AND BECAME ONE OF OUR BEST LOVED AND MOST PROLIFIC COMPOSERS HERE'S A LITTLE OF THE LARK ASCENDING TWICE VOTED THE NATION'S FAVOURITE PIECE OF CLASSICAL MUSIC
