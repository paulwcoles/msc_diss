BECAUSE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN GETS A FEEL AND I CAN'T GET MY DID YOU AND YOU'RE A BIT TIGHTER THAN MY LIST THAT'S WE DID THINK INSTEP AND THEY'VE GOT VERY I'M ANDY IT'S
I MEAN WE JOIN ON THE LINE FROM ABUJA FROM NIALL CORRESPONDENT TOMMY ALLOWED DEPOT AT TOMMY IS IT A GOOD OMEN OR IS THERE IS A GROWING SUSPICION THAT THESE GIRLS ARE GRADUALLY BEING RELEASED AS PART OF GETTING NEGOTIATIONS GOING AGAIN
THE MILITARY HAS GIVEN NO INDICATION THAT IT HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH BOOKER AROUND THEY'RE MAKING IT LOOK AS IF IT'S THEIR MILITARY OPERATIONS THAT ARE SECURING THE RELEASE OF THESE GIRLS THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT BULK AROUND SEEMS TO BE A WEAKENING AT THE MOMENT RUNNING OUT OF SUPPLIES INCLUDING FOOD AND THAT'S WHY THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING
SO IT MAY BE TEMPTING FOR THEM TO GET NEGOTIATIONS GOING IN THERE HOPE EITHER THAT THEY GET SOME FOOD OR THAT THE MILITARY BACK OFF
CERTAINLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME LET'S REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A GROUP THAT HAS SAID HE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH THEN WE HAVE SEEN THEM USE ALL KINDS OF TACTICS AGAINST THE NIGERIAN MILITARY SO THEY ARE NOT SORT OF PUSHING FOR ANY KIND OF POLITICAL AGENDA OR TRYING TO TALK THEY HAVE BACKED OUT OF TALKS MANY TIMES AND HAVE THREATENED THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO TALK AT ALL

TOMMY TOMMY ALADDIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN IT THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX NORTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL IS CONSIDERING A PLANNING APPLICATION THAT MIGHT BOOST THE FRACKING INDUSTRY AND GET IT STARTED AGAIN ROGER RAMADAN OR SOME ON THE LIME ROGER WHAT'S BEEN CONCETTA VINCE IS A BIG DEAL JUST IN THIS IF IT WAS APPROVED WOULD BE THERE
FIRST A FULL ON START OF FRACKING IN THE U.K. IF YOU THINK BACK TO TWENTY ELEVEN THERE WAS THAT INCIDENT NEAR BLACKPOOL WHERE CUADRILLA CAUSED A COUPLE ARE TINY TINY EARTHQUAKES WHICH BROUGHT THE GOVERNMENT SHALE GAS REVOLUTION SHUDDERING TO A HOLD THEN LAST YEAR LANCASHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL TURNED DOWN AN APPLICATION AGAINST THE ADVICE OF ITS OFFICERS NOW NORTH YORKSHIRE IS LOOKING AT AN APPLICATION WHICH ITS OFFICERS HAVE ADVISED IT TO ACCEPT AND ITS SET ASIDE A DAY AND THEN
TODAY AND THEN ALSO MONDAY FOR HEARINGS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT SO MANY PEOPLE WANTING TO TALK SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SHOW TRIAL OF FRACKING AND ARE THOSE OBJECTING OBJECTING TO FRACKING ITSELF OR OBJECTING TO WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO THE LANDSCAPE ABOVE
GROUND OR WHAT OR BOTH WELL THAT'S THE THING JUSTIN THERE'S SEVERAL AGENDAS HERE AND SOME OF THEM REALLY NOT VERY TRANSPARENT SO FOR THE LOCALS IT'S VERY VERY CLEAR THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT NOISE AND POLLUTION FROM LORRIES IN PARTICULAR HAD DUST AND DISRUPTION THAT'S THEIR BIG CONCERN THEY'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT LOCAL WATER SUPPLIES ENVIRONMENTALISTS HAVE MADE A LOT OF THE WATER ISSUE BUT REALLY WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS C.O.TWO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING OUT OF C.O.TWO SO HOW DO WE NEED MORE
GAS AND THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S CONCERNED ABOUT ENERGY SECURITY IT'S ALSO MASSIVELY MASSIVELY CONCERNED TO REPLACE THAT HUGE CASH COW THAT IS THE NORTH SEA OIL INDUSTRY AND ITS HOPES AT THE TREASURY COFFERS WILL BE FILLED IN FUTURE BY SHALE GAS SO THAT IT UNDERNEATH A SORT OF THE LOCAL ISSUES THERE'S THIS VAST MACRO DEBATE GOING ON WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS EXPRESS BUT IT WAS THE LOCAL ISSUES WASN'T IT IT WAS THE LORRIES THAT THEY DID IN LANCASHIRE NORTON ABSOLUTELY THIS WAS A BIT LIKE AL CAPONE IN THE TAX EVASION THING YOU KNOW
REMEMBER THAT LANCASHIRE DECISION IS BEING APPEALED AT THE MOMENT AND I SUSPECT AS SOON AS THE REFERENDUMS OUT OF THE WAY THEN SUDDENLY WE MAY FIND OUT THAT THE LORRIES ARE NOT SUCH A BIG ISSUE AFTER ALL WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES BUT I MEAN YOU NORTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL CAN GO ONE FURTHER THAN THAT AND ACTUALLY GET THINGS STARTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO MAY BE IF THEY GIVE THE GO AHEAD MAYBE WE COULD SEE SHALE GAS COMING OUT AND POWERING LOCAL HOMES HEATING LOCAL HOMES AS EARLY AS THIS YEAR WAS CERTAINLY HAVE ALMOST CERTAINLY NEXT YEAR
AND WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE AFFECTED AREA AND INDEED FROM ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COMPANY WANTS TO GET GOING WITH THIS FRACKING LATER ON THE PROGRAMME ROGER THANKS FOR THAT IT IS A CALLED A BAR SIX PLACE YOUR BETS WILL TWO OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST BOOKIES LADBROKES HAVE GALA BE PERMITTED TO MERGE WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT DECISION SOONER ROB YEUNG
IS HE WITH THAT AND THE REST OF THE BUSINESS NEWS MORNING YES GOOD MORNING THIS IS A TWO BILLION POUND DEAL WHICH WOULD LEAD TO THE CREATION OF THE U.K.'S BIGGEST BOOKIE WITH LADBROKES CORAL HAVING ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND SHOPS THE REGULATOR HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING AFTER CONCERNS WERE RAISED ABOUT THE IMPACT ON COMPETITION ON OUR MARKETS GUESS THIS MORNING AS RICHARD HUNTER THE HEAD OF RESEARCH AT WILSON KING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT MORNING RICHARD GOOD MORNING THIS IS A PROVISIONAL DECISION TODAY ISN'T IT BUT WOULD YOU PUT A FIVER ON THE MERGER BEING GIVEN THE GO AHEAD
YES I THINK SO WE'VE HAD OTHER MERGES RECENTLY OF SOME DESCRIPTION CINCHES PADDY POWER BUT FOR OF COURSE NOW FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANY ON THAT BASIS ALONE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IT'S LIKELY THAT THIS IS GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS COMES AT A TIME OF COURSE WHERE SAME HIS REACH IRISH IN GENERAL THERE IS MORE OF THE MOON
TOWARDS THE KIND OF ONLINE TYPE GAMING RATHER THAN PHYSICAL BETTING SHOPS NOT WITHSTANDING THAT PHYSICAL BETTING SHOPS ARE MUCH MORE ROOM FRESH AND ON THE HIGH STREET OR A FEW YEARS AGO AS MORE PEOPLE GAMBLE ONLINE IS IT SENSIBLE FOR A COMPANY LIKE THIS TO HAVE FOUR THOUSAND SHOPS SHOULD THEY PERHAPS BE FOCUSING MORE
ON ON ONLINE GAMBLING I'M SURE IT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL BE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO AND OF COURSE IN TERMS OF ANY MERGER ONE IF THE HEADLINES COMING FROM BOTH SETS OF MANAGEMENT IS LIKELY TO BE THAT THERE WILL BE SYNERGY IS IN OTHER WORDS COST SAVINGS JOB CUTS AS A RESULT OF THIS AND CERTAINLY THE PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL BE PART OF THAT REVIEW WHAT IS THIS MERGER LIKELY TO MEAN FOR THE RIVALS OF THE NEW COMPANY LIKE PADDY POWER AND WILLIAM HILL
THERE MIGHT COME A STAGE WHEN THERE'S TOO MUCH OF A CONCENTRATION OF POWER YOU HAVE TOO BIG THE FAIRLY GIANT COMPANIES THERE WITHIN THIS SPACE BUT OF COURSE THE ARGUMENT
AGAINST THAT WILL BE THE BARRIERS CENTURY ARE FAIRLY LOW FOR FOR ONLINE BETTING COMPANY FOR EXAMPLE AS OPPOSED TO A PHYSICAL PRESENCE ONCE AND WHILST THAT COMPETITION DOES MIND SUFFICIENTLY ROBUST I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY THIS ONE WILL PROBABLY GET THREE AND WHAT MIGHT IT ALL MEAN MEAN FOR PUNTERS AND THE ODDS THAT WE GET AS THEIR ONLY CONCERN THERE
AGAIN THAT WOULD BE A COMPETITION CONCERN IF IT WAS TOO TOO CONCENTRATED AND IN TRUE FEW COMPANIES THAT BEING SAID OF COURSE CONTAINED SIMILAR RETAILERS IT'S FUNNY HOW THESE THINGS MOVE IN KNOCK INSTEAD
BUT EVENTUALLY TO OTHER RETAILERS TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE ODDS ACROSS DIFFERENT COMPANIES IS FAIRLY SIMPLE TASK AGAIN ON RHYME THEY WHY IT WHILE WE'VE GOT YOU HERE RICH THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER COMPANIES DO HIS ROUNDS THIS MORNING SIR CIGARETTES WILL BE SOLD IN STANDARD PLAIN GREEN PACKAGING FROM TODAY THERE WILL BE NO LOGOS JUST GRAPHIC HEALTH WARNINGS THAT AFTER A LEGAL CHALLENGE AGAINST A LAW BROUGHT BY FOUR OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TOBACCO COMPANIES WAS DISMISSED BY THE HIGH COURT ALTHOUGH THE IMPACT BE DO YOU THINK ON THESE FIRMS
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE THE PHONES TO BACK OF HOMES HAD HAD A WHILE TO TO BE THINKING ABOUT HE WAS INTRODUCED FOR EXAMPLE IN AUSTRALIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THEY HAD BEEN GENERAL CONCERNS AROUND T'BACK ACCOMPANIES WHICH RELATE TO THINGS LIKE LITIGATION PARTICULARLY ESTATE FOR EXAMPLE PLAIN PACKAGING WHICH WAS A WAGER A POTENTIAL BLOT ON THE HORIZON THAT BEING SAID
WITH THIS IN MIND MANY OF THE TOBACCO COMPANIES MOVE THEIR PRODUCTION OPERATION SOME YEARS AGO ON OUR TRIP TO CHEAPER EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND WHILST THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS A QUESTIONABLE LONG TERM FUTURE IN THE INTERIM PERIOD THEY CONTINUE TO GENERATE EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNTS OF CASH WHICH TENDS TO FILTER THROUGH TO HIGH DIVIDEND YOUTH FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS MAGMA FAIRLY
FAIRLY ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT IF IF NOT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE UNDERLYING THING IN WHICH THEY DO OH KAY AND BRIEFLY WE'VE HAD A LOT OF PAPERS COVER THIS THIS MORNING COMMENT FOR A BANK OF ENGLAND RATE SET SAYING AT THE BANKS SHOULD BE READY TO CUT INTEREST RATES TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY AFTER THE E.U. REFERENDUM IS THE ECONOMY WEAKER THAN PERHAPS WE THINK IT COULD WELL BE WE WE'VE SEEN MIXED MESSAGES COMING OUT OF ON THE DOWNSIDE MANUFACTURING ON THE UPSIDE RETAIL SALES YESTERDAY BUT OF COURSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY AT THIS STAGE HOW MUCH INVESTMENT HAS BEEN HELD BACK
UNTIL WE KNOW THE OUTCOME OR JUNE TWENTY CERT ALL RIGHT THANKS AND ALBERT DIE STAY WITH US RICHARD NOW WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT EUROPE'S BIGGEST INVESTMENT BANK DEUTSCHE BANK WHICH HAS DRAWN SCATHING CRITICISM FROM SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE PAY OF ITS EXECUTIVES FIFTY TWO PERCENT VOTED AGAINST THE REMUNERATION REPORT TELLING THE BOARD THAT SIMPLY PAID TOO MUCH BUT IT WASN'T A BINDING VOTE SALARIES HAVE BEEN RISING RECENTLY AT THE COMPANY LOST MORE THAN FIVE BILLION POUNDS LAST YEAR ONE SHAREHOLDER HAS DESCRIBED THIS AS THE MOST SERIOUS CRISIS IN THE BANK'S HISTORY
THE CHAIRMAN HAS INSISTED THAT HE WILL NOT RESIGN HANDS OR CHRISTOPHE FROM THE SHAREHOLDER ADVISERS HOMER'S AND AS ONE OF THOSE WHO VOTED AGAINST YOU HAD SEVERAL CONCERNS COULD SCIENCE ABOUT INCREASING FIXED SALARIES OFF TO OFF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD THEY HAVE DECREASED THE OVERALL COMPENSATION BUT NOT QUITE AS MUCH AS WOULD HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED ARGUABLY GIVEN TO RECORD LOSS THEY HAVE MADE
POPPY PETER HARD AS A FORMER INVESTMENT BANKER HIMSELF AS A PROFESSOR OF BANKING AT THE INSTITUTE FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES GOOD MORNING WORRY HOW SERIOUS THAT IS ALL OF THIS FOR DEUTSCHE BACK WELL IT'S A SERIOUS GOVERNANCE ISSUE BUT IT'S ALSO I THINK THE POINT HAS RAISED HIGHER FIX THEM AS PART OF IT IS A RISK FACTOR IN BANKING TODAY
BANKERS FOR MANY YEARS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR LIMITED ABILITY TO PAY BONUSES AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT BANKS HAVE RAISED FIXED COMPENSATION THAT MEANS THEY'RE LESS FLEXIBLE AND A DOWNTURN SO HIGHER SALARIES MEANS MORE RISK IN THE BANKING SYSTEM
THE DEUTSCHE CHIEF EXECUTIVE JOHN CRYING DID SUGGEST LAST YEAR THAT BANKERS ARE PAID TOO MUCH AND IT SEEMS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO OWN AS BUSINESS AGREEMENT THEY CERTAINLY DO I THINK AS A AS A MOUNT OF SHAREHOLDERS OBJECTING WE REALLY SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT NUMBER IN THE U.K. FOR EVEN THE MOST TO GREET SITUATIONS IS QUITE A BIG NUMBER BUT I THINK I WOULD TAKE JOHN CRYING TO POINT ONE FIVE STEP FURTHER
INDUSTRIES WITH LOW RETURNS GENERALLY DON'T PAY HIGH SALARIES AND HIGH TOTAL COMPENSATION AND I THINK THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE THANKING RETURN ON EQUITY IS RELATIVELY LOW SO THE HIGH PAY AND LOW RETURNS DON'T FIT TOGETHER AND INVESTMENT BANKING IS HAVING A PARTICULARLY TOUGH TIME OF IT AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE OF RECORD LOW INTEREST RATES IT'S JUST INTEREST RATES THE MARBLE CHANGED A LOT
INVESTMENT BANKING SHOULD BE A BUSINESS THAT IS CAPITAL LATE USES LET MUPPET AS MUCH EQUITY FLEXIBLE LOWER FIXED COSTS AND WHAT HAPPENED IS OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS BANKS HAVE EXPANDED THAT BUSINESS SO MUCH SO IT HAS A WAY TO LLOYD TO FIX CHOIR SPACE AND THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT AS FAST AS THEY CAN
AMERICAN INVESTMENT BANKS THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE HAVING AS TOUGH A TIME OF IT AS EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK SO IT SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WELL THE U.S. WHOLE MARKET'S DONE MUCH BETTER THAN EUROPE
SO IN FACT WE SEE THAT EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANKS WITH SUBSTANTIAL U.S. BUSINESSES HAVE DONE FAIRLY WELL WITH IT IN THE U.S. BUT FOR YOUR EUROPEAN INVESTMENT THE HEADACHES THEY EXPANDED TOO MUCH ALL OFF IN THE WRONG PRODUCTS WITH THE POOREST MARGINS WHICH WERE THEY WERE OVER RELIANT ON FIXED INCOME RELATED BUSINESSES THE U.S. BANKS HAVE MUCH STRONGER EQUITY RELATED BUSINESS
WHAT DO THESE INVESTMENT BANKS IN EUROPE THEN NEED TO DO TO YOU TO START MAKING MONEY AGAIN AND THEREFORE I SUPPOSE THESE THE COMPANY EXECUTIVES CAN COMPARE THEMSELVES WHAT THEY LIKE AND SHAREHOLDER WILL BE A LOT HAPPIER IT'S ABOUT COSTS THAT THAT'S REALLY WHERE IT IS THEY NEED TO THEY NEED TO REDUCE THEIR FIXED COSTS THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE FEWER PEOPLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS CAPITAL COMMITTED TO THE BUSINESS RICHARD HUNTER
SHOULD THESE VOTES ON PAY BE BINDING EACH AND EVERY YEAR
ALL WE KNOW OF COURSE AT THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE COMMITTEE FEEDS INTO WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS JUST SHOWING HOW HAD THE DEPTH OF FEELING IT OUT THEN IN TERMS OF THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT IN TERMS OF THE A.G.M. THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING WHY SHOULD THEY NOT BE BINDING FOR FOR THOSE TWELVE MONTHS DURING WHICH TIME THE OUT OUT OF MY MIND IT WAS CHALLENGED
O.K. PETER RICHARD ONTO THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH A DO THIS MORNING NOW THIS TIME ON A FRIDAY WE ALWAYS SPEND A BIT OF TIME WITH HER COMPANY BOSS THIS WEEK I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A BUSINESS LEADER WHO HAS A BETTER CLAIM THAN MOST TO BEING A DIAMOND GEEZER THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DIAMOND GIANT DE BEERS UP INTO THEIR COMPANY HEADQUARTERS IN LONDON
I'M IN A ROOM SURROUNDED BY SHINY JEWELLERY WITH SPARKLING DIAMONDS ON THEM THERE'S A VERY NICE LOOKING NECKLACE HERE WORTH AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF ME WHAT APPEAR TO BE A PILE OF RATHER DIRTY LOOKING PEBBLES BUT WHICH ARE I SUSPECT ACTUALLY ROUGH DIAMONDS WORTH OF ORCHARD A FILLY IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF DE BEERS GROUP GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
HOW WAS THE GLOBAL DIAMOND BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT AT THE MOMENT THE BUSINESS IS RECOVERING LAST YEAR WE HAD A BIT OF A SLOWDOWN SECOND PART OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WE ARE COMING BACK TO A NORMAL PURSES ON THE LUTEA WITH A MARKET WHICH IS BROADLY IN LINE WITH THE PREVIOUS YEARS
WE COMMUNICATE ALL SIGHTS NUMBER WHICH ARE THE PERIOD WHEN WE SELL DIAMONDS AFTER THREE SIDES WE WE HAD ALREADY THIS YEAR THE NUMBERS ARE O.K. THE REFLECTING THE CAUTIOUS RECOVERY OF THE MARKET IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTY
WHO ARE YOU ESSENTIALLY FEELING THE EFFECT OF WHAT IS A GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN PARTICULARLY A SLOWDOWN IN CHINA NOT REALLY BECAUSE BIGGEST MARKET FOR THEM AND THE U.S. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN DO WAS ACCOUNTED FOR FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WORLD MARKET WHEN CHINA IS AROUND SEVENTEEN PERCENT AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE BOKE OF THE BUSINESS THE HEART OF OUR BUSINESS
HE'S NOT LINKED WITH A THING LIKE THIS IT'S A BRIDAL BUSINESS SO AS LONG AS CHINESE I'M GOING TO GET THEM GAUGE AND MARRIED AND I THINK MANY OF THEM ARE GOING TO DO WITH THAT BECAUSE THE MIDDLE CLASS IS GROWING STILL IN CHINA DESPITE A SLOW DOWN
THE BUSINESS IS GOING TO GO WHEN YOUR CRITICS SAY THAT YOU ESSENTIALLY FIXED THE PRICE OF DIAMONDS BY STORING HUGE NUMBERS OF THEM ONLY RELEASING THEM WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO DO SO IN THE MARKET IN A WAY THAT WOULD NOT LET THE PRICE WHAT PRICE FIXING IS NOT AT ALL WHAT WE DO OBVIOUSLY IN THE PAST WHEN THE BEER'S HAD EIGHTY PER CENT MARQUETRY THERE WAS CLEARLY AN ACCUSATION
THE READING AND COMPANY WERE THE NUMBER ONE BY VALUE WITH THE MARQUETRY OVER ON THE THIRD OF THE WORLD MARKET WE SET OUR PACE OF ROUGH DIAMONDS WE DO OUR BUSINESS WE DON'T FIX A NEW PRICE WE JUST TRIED TO BE AS COMPETITIVE AS WE CAN IN THE CURRENT MARKETPLACE SO WHAT TRENDS THEN ARE YOU SITTING AMONG DIAMOND SALES AT THE MOMENT IN TERMS OF PERHAPS COLOURED DIAMONDS ARE YOU TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE YOURSELF FROM THESE NEW COMPETITORS BY PROMOTING THE THE ETHICALLY SOURCED NATURE OF YOUR DIET
ALL OF THE DIAMOND SOLD BY THE BEE AS ONE OF DIAMONDS ARE COMING FROM OUR OWN MINDS AND WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY COME FROM THEY ARE SORTED AND SOLD BY ABSOLUTELY ETHICAL DIAMONDS AND WE ARE PART OF THE PROCESS SO WE WE SHOULD BALL BECAME VERY PROCESS WE SEE ENSURING THE PROVENANCE OR DIAMONDS BUT OLD DIAMONDS ARE CLEARLY TOTALLY ETHIC THICK ON THIS RATHER NICE NECKLACE WHICH MIGHT COST UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH MADE HIM A BRIGHT WHICH IS NEAR US HERE HOW MANY OF THOSE TYPES OF
PIECES OF JEWELLERY WHAT WOULD YOU SELL IN AN AVERAGE YEAR BUSINESS IN TERMS OF SENDING DRURY IS QUITE SMALL SO MOST OF THE BUSINESS IS BEING DONE BY OUR CUSTOMERS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS OF OUR CUSTOMERS BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THIS IS A COMMON PIECE BUT IN THE WORLD NICHOLAS LIKE THESE WOULD BE SOLD IN THERE QUITE A BIG NUMBER LITERALLY IN THE U.S. SUNSHINE WHEN A FEW PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT BY WEARING THIS TYPE OF NECKLACE IT'S A SEVEN CARAT
IF YOU GO INTO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE WEDDING IN INDIA YOU WOULD SEE WHAT MOST OF THE WOMAN ATTENDING THE WEDDING YOU COULD SIR WITH THE WEDDING WE'LL HAVE MAYBE TEN AND TWENTY CARROTS IN EACH EAR
I WAS PHILIPPE MEL YEAH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF DE BEERS DIAMOND EARRINGS OF TEN TO TWENTY CARATS AND EACH LET'S SEE THE PRICE TO ONE SIDE BUT THE WEIGHT OF THAT SOMETHING MUST BE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE

YEAH WELL IT IS ON THAT AND ON THE INQUIRY IN GENERAL AND WITH THAT THE FRENCH BUREAU INVESTIGATIONS ARE SAID TO CAIRO AND THEY'RE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN ALL OF THIS WAS IT WAS COMING FROM

IS OF INTEREST BECAUSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ATTACKS LAST YEAR WE KNOW THAT SECURITY WAS STEPPED UP THEIR LAST YEAR ALL EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND WE'VE GOT SECURITY CLEARANCE TO GO FAR OUTSIDE AND SAUNA ARE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED HAVE THE LAST YEAR BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY BAD CLEARANCE AS BEEN DOUBLE CHECK A NUMBER OF PEOPLE I'M TOLD BY THE PEOPLE HAD THEIR SECURITY CLEARANCE REVOKED IN THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE
THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WHO TURNS OUT WHO WATCH LES SHALL EFFIE'S RADICALS PEOPLE WHO SHOULD TENDENCIES OF MOVING HIM IN RADICAL ISLAMIC CIRCLES IT IS NOT I MEAN IT'S NOT HUGE IS SURPRISING BECAUSE THE RECRUITMENT AREA FOR SHOULDER WAS VERY MUCH IN THAT NORTHERN
PARIS BORN WHERE THERE WAS A VERY HIGH IMMIGRATION ARE VERY VERY HIGH MUSLIM POPULAR IT WAS MUSLIM POPULATION SO THAT IT'S A IT'S A FOCUS OF ENQUIRY AS FOOTBALL WE CAN SAY WITHOUT LOOKING THING AND BE MORE
MORE ABOUT IT CERTAINLY THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT TO SEE WHETHER IT COULD BE A BREACH THERE THAT THE MOST LIKELY WAY WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE WHO WAS ACTING ON THE INSIDE BUT IT'S ONLY ONE OF MANY MANY YOU'D LINES WE GROW THEM FOR OPEN THERE AND WE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP SOME OF THE OTHERS UNEASY TALKING A BIT MORE ABOUT THE QUESTION OF THE NUMBER OF SECURITY PERSONNEL ON THE PLANE LATER ON DURING THE COURSE THAT HE SKILFULLY FOR THE MOMENT THANKS
TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN A RECORD DEFICIT WITH MANAGERS UNDER PRESSURE TO COOK THE BOOKS TO MAKE THEM SEEM BETTER THAN THEY REALLY ARE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE STORY IN THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND OR HEALTH EDITOR HUGH PYM CAN TELL US MORE AND YOU'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO A WHISTLE BLOWER ABOUT WHAT THE THEY ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO DO TO MAKE THEIR FINANCES LOOK BETTER YES NICK THIS IS A HOSPITAL TRUST FINANCE DIRECTOR WHO WISHES TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS
I DID GIVE EVIDENCE TO A PARLIAMENTARY SELECT COMMITTEE ANONYMOUSLY BUT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO HIM AND HE'S BEEN VOICING CONCERNS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN A BID TO TRY TO KICK COME IN WITHIN ITS SPENDING LIMIT FOR THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR WHICH ENDED IN MARCH HE'S RESORTING TO PRETTY UNORTHODOX MEASURES THAT WILL GET THE SCALE OF THE DEFICIT OVERALL IN HOSPITAL TRUSTS AND OTHER TRUSTS TODAY MAYBE UP TO THREE BILLION POUNDS
OR JUST UNDER TO MAKE THE BOOKS ADD UP CIRCUSES HAVE TO BE FOUND ELSEWHERE IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN GENERAL PRACTICE IN COMMISSIONING GROUPS AND SO ON AND NORMALLY THAT'S JUST ABOUT POSSIBLE
BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE DEMAND OF HEALTH IS RESORTING TO THESE DIFFERENT MEASURES NOT TRANSLATE THAT WHILE HE TELLS ME THAT ACCOUNTING ALCHEMY IS BEING USED AND THIS IS TRANSFERRING MONEY FROM CAPITAL INVESTMENT SPENDING INTO DAY TO DAY SPENDING IN PRINCIPLE THAT'S NOT
COMPLETELY OUT OF HAND THAT IS DONE ON A HOSPITAL BY HOSPITAL BASIS HE SAYS HE HAS GRAVE CONCERNS HE ALSO SAYS ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS HAVE BEEN SPENT IN SENT INTO TWENTY TRUSTS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP AND ACTUALLY GO BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SAY WELL ACTUALLY THESE ARE RATHER PESSIMISTIC THESE ASSUMPTIONS
ART TOO PRUDENT AND ACTUALLY YOU COULD SORT OF FIND ANOTHER COUPLE OF HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE ACCOUNTS ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE SAYING YOU KNOW TAKE LESS PRECAUTIONS WITH THEIR BOOKS AND ALSO ROBS HER MONEY THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR INVESTMENT SPENDING IN THE FUTURE AND USE IT NOW TO SEW A PATCH UP THE PATCH AT THE STATE OF THEIR FINANCES
THAT'S WHAT HE IS ALLEGING THAT THE SIGNIFICANCE IS IF THE DEPARTMENT CAN'T COME IN WITH IT TO ITS SPENDING LIMIT THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED IN WHITEHALL MEANS THAT WHAT WAS VOTED BY PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN OVERSPENT THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE WILL BE ALL OVER IT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE DEPARTMENT FOR THAT NOT JUST A POLITICAL EMBARRASSED BUT TRIGGERS A WHOLE POLITICAL PROCESS HE'S OUT THERE SAYING THEY THINK THEY CAN COME IN WITHIN BUDGET THEY SAY THEY'VE INVESTED TEN BILLION POUNDS IN THE FUTURE THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THEY SAY THAT
TO SUGGEST ANYTHING UNTOWARD IS GOING ON WITH CAPITAL TO REVENUE TRANSFERS IS MISLEADING UGLY THEY ARE ACTING WITHIN THE LIMITS THAT PARLIAMENT GAVE THEM THAT WILL CERTAINLY LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT N.H.S. FINANCES WITH THESE DEFICIT FIGURES TODAY MORE FROM YOU LATER ON WILL BE HEARING FROM THE HEAD OF N.H.S. PROVIDE AS WELL
TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN HOW DO YOU GET YOUTUBE TO PAY MORE FOR THE MUSIC THAT PEOPLE WATCH AND ENJOY FOR FREE ON ITS WEBSITE THE ARTIST'S BODY THE BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHIC INDUSTRY SAYS THERE'S BEEN A VERY BIG INCREASE IN VIEWING OF MUSIC BUT ONLY A TINY INCREASE IN THE REVENUES FROM IT ROY KATHRYN JAMES TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE AND ROWING OR GENERALLY SEE THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM
THEY SAY THE TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS OVERALL A GREAT YEAR FOR BRITISH MUSIC AND BRITISH ARTIST DOING REALLY WELL ABROAD LOTS OF WAYS OF LISTENING THEY'RE EARNING MORE MONEY FROM THINGS LIKE SPOTIFY BUT REVENUE OVERALL FOR SALES ACTUALLY FELL FOR THE INDUSTRY AND THE P.P.I. SEEMS TO PUT PART OF THE BLAME ON THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE NOW GETTING LOTS OF MUSIC FREE ON VIDEO STREAMING SITES LIKE YOUTUBE HERE'S THE B.P.I. CHIEF EXECUTIVE GEOFF TAYLOR
DESPITE A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MUSIC VIDEOS THAT WATCHED ONLINE THERE'S NO MORE MONEY BEING PAID BACK TO ARTISTS AND TO RECORD LABELS FOR THE USE OF THAT MUSIC SERVICES LIKE YOUTUBE ARE ABLE TO EXPLOIT LOOPHOLES IN E.U. COPYRIGHT COPYRIGHT PROTECTION SO THEY PAY ONLY A FRACTION OF THE ROYALTIES THAT ARE PAID BY OTHER SERVICES LIKE SPOTTY FIRED UP ON MUSIC IF
ALL THE GROWTH IS COMING FROM THESE AREAS LIKE CONSUMPTION VIDEO AND YET KNOWN MORE REVENUE IS COMING BACK TO ARTIS LABELS THAN THAT MEANS WE CAN'T INVEST IN SIGNING NEW ARTISTS RELEASING YOU MUSIC ROY WHAT A YOUTUBE SAY WELL GOOGLE WHICH OWNS YOU CHIEF THINKS HE'S MADE IT CLEAR HE THINKS THIS IS NONSENSE IT SAYS IT'S INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY AND WHAT IT CALLS A CONTENT I D. SYSTEM OR RIGHTS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY TO HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF THEIR MUSIC ON YOUTUBE AND DECIDE WHETHER TO HAVE IT TAKEN DOWN ALL PROFIT FROM IT AND IT SAYS THE COMPARISON TO AUDIO ONLY A SUBSCRIPTION MUSIC SERVICES LIKE SPOTIFY THEY SAY IT'S APPLES ORANGES IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUSINESS THEY THEY BASICALLY SAY YOUTUBE'S A GREAT WAY OF PROMOTING YOUR MUSIC STOP WORRYING ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU ARE BURNING FROM IT YEAH AND THEY GOT A POINT REALLY
WELL THEY DO HAVE A POINT BUT I THINK WHAT THIS SHOWS YET AGAIN IS HOW POWERFUL THESE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE IN TURN THEY THEY WANT TO BE SEEN AS MEDIA COMPANIES YOUR GOOGLES YOUR FACEBOOK'S BUT THEY ARE NOW HUGE MEDIA PLAYERS AND THE THE THE LEGACY CREATIVE INDUSTRIES AS IT WERE THERE REAL RESENT THAT
AND THEIR CLAIM IS THAT ADELE'S NOT SHORT OF A BOB OR TWO BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE MONEY IS NOT GOING TO THOSE AREAS WHERE NEW ARTIST COULD BE ENCOURAGED AND MONEY SPENT ON ON BACKING NEW BANDS ET-CETERA THAT'S THE POINT THERE MATT THAT'S THEIR CLAIM AND SHE WOULD COME BACK AND SAY LISTEN THE WAY NEW BANDS GET GET FAILED GET DISCOVERED TO PUBLICISE THEMSELVES IS BY HIS BUT DOING ON YOUTUBE EXACTLY AND JAMES THANKS

HE SUGGESTS THE RISE IN INVESTIGATIONS IS NOT SOLELY EXPLAINED BY INCREASE REPORTING BUT AS A RESULT OF THE INTERNET ACTING AS A FACILITATOR FOR PAEDOPHILES TO CONTACT CHILDREN THE LEAD STORY IN THE DAILY MAIL CLAIMS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS ORDERED THE GOVERNMENT TO BUILD MORE HOUSES IN ORDER TO COPE WITH ALL THE E. U. IMMIGRANTS THE DEMAND FEATURED IN A REPORT THAT WAS QUIETLY SLIPPED OUT ON WEDNESDAY BUT UNCOVER THE PAPER SAYS BY THE CABINET MINISTER AND VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNER CHRIS GRAYLING
HIS VIEW THAT HIS VIEWS EITHER BRITTON'S CHARACTER WOULD BE CHANGED FOREVER IF WE CONCRETE OVER THE COUNTRY IS BACKED BY THE MALE'S EDITORIAL WHICH ARGUES THE BY PROFFERING IMPERMANENT INSTRUCTIONS THE COMMISSION HAS HELPED TO MAKE LEAVES CASE
SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT FROM SEVERAL COUNTRIES ARE SCOURING THE MEDITERRANEAN SOUTH OF CRETE FOR THE WRECKAGE OF AN EGYPTIAN AIRLINER WHICH DISAPPEAR EARLY YESTERDAY THE HEALTH SECRETARY TOLD M.P.S YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT THAT THE NEW DEAL ON A NEW CONTRACT FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS IS A WIN WIN JEREMY HUNT SAID HE RECOGNISED THE NEED FOR WELL MOTIVATED AND HAPPY DOCTORS AS THEY PREPARED TO VOTE ON THE AGREEMENT HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HERE
THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT USED TO HAVE SOME HARSH WORDS FOR THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION BUT NOW THEY'VE STRUCK A DEAL SO AFTER A LONG AND BITTER DISPUTE OVER THE JUNIOR DOCTORS' CONTRACT IN ENGLAND THE LANGUAGE HAS CHANGED I WOULD FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO EXPRESS MY THANKS TO THE B.M.A. FOR THE LEADERSHIP THEY HAVE SHOWN IN RETURNING TO TALKS NEGOTIATED IN GOOD FAITH AND MAKING AN AGREEMENT POSSIBLE
JEREMY HUNT SAID THE DEAL WOULD REDUCED BY A THIRD OF THE COST OF EMPLOYING MORE DOCTORS AT WEEKENDS THERE'S A WORK MORE WEEKENDS WOULD GET MORE PAY STILL SOUNDING CONCILIATORY HE ADMITTED THE NEW DEAL DIDN'T GET RID OF EVERY BUGBEAR OF FRUSTRATION AND JUNIOR DOCTORS STILL HAVE TO GIVE THEIR VERDICT ON THE DEAL SO HE ADDRESSED THEM DIRECTLY WHATEVER OUR DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE CONTRACT MAY HAVE
THE GOVERNMENT HAS HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD THE WIDER FRUSTRATIONS THAT YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WAY YOUR VALUED AND TREATED IN THE N.H.S.
A PRIORITY WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAFETY OF PATIENTS BUT WE ALSO RECOGNISE THAT TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY CARE WE NEED A. WELL MOTIVATED AND HAPPY JUNIOR DOCTOR WORKFORCE
HIS LABOUR SHADOW HEIDI ALEXANDER REFLECTED ON HER EARLIER ENCOUNTERS WITH JEREMY HUNT OVER THIS I HAVEN'T BEEN SHY IN TELLING THE HOUSE SECRETARY I THINK
ABOUT HIS HANDLING OF THIS DISPUTE BUT TODAY IS NOT THE DAY TO REPEAT THOSE CRITICISMS
ON SECOND THOUGHTS MAYBE IT WAS THE DAY FOR THAT WHY COULDN'T THIS HAVE BEEN STRUCK IN FEBRUARY WHY DID HE LIE HIS PRIDE
TO COME BEFORE THE SENSIBLE COMPROMISE AND CONSTRUCTIVE
AS FOR HIS NEGOTIATING STRATEGY IT WAS A COMPUTER SAYS NO ATTITUDE AND THAT'S A NO
RUN THE N.H.S. AND HEIDI ALEXANDER SUGGESTED IT WAS TIME FOR A PERIOD OF RADIO SILENCE FROM JEREMY HUNT YOU KNEW DOCTOR IS CONSIDERED THE DEAL HE PROTESTED THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN THE CURRENT JUNIOR DOCTORS CONTRACT PUT IN PLACE BY THE LAST LABOUR GOVERNMENT
WE HAD MANY DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE B.M.A. BUT ONE THING WE AGREE ON LABOUR'S CONTRACT WAS NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE AND FRANKLY CRITICISING THE GOVERNMENT FOR TRYING TO PUT THAT CONTRACT RIGHT
HE'S LIKE CRITICISING A MECHANIC MENDING THE CAR YOU JUST CRASHED BUT BEFORE THE DIAL ON THE THERMOSTAT GOT NUDGED UP TOO HIGH THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE DOCTOR SARAH WALLASTON RECKONED THAT WHAT'S NEEDED NOW IS A PERIOD OF VERY CALM REFER
AND TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH JUNIOR DOCTORS GOING INTO THE FUTURE
AFTER CLAIMS THAT WOMEN WOULD BE UNFAIRLY HIT BY THE NEW CONTRACT THE LATEST DEAL GIVES MORE SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO TAKE TIME OUT SUCH AS WOMEN WHO GO ON MATERNITY LEAVE TO ENABLE THEM TO CATCH UP ON THEIR TRAINING AND THUS QUALIFY FOR A PAY RISES THE S.N.P. IS PHILIPPA WHITFORD WHO'S A SURGEON WAS PLEASED BUT ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS THE ISSUE OF CHILD CARE
WOMEN JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE GOING TO BE WORKING LONGER SHIFTS MORE ANTI SOCIAL SHIFTS I REMEMBER MYSELF WHAT I HAD TO FORK OUT FOR CHILDCARE SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS THE N.H.S. COMING TO RESPOND TO
JEREMY HUNT ANSWERED THAT N.H.S. TRUSTS SHOULD BE FLEXIBLE WERE POSSIBLE ON ACCOMMODATING CHILDCARE NEEDS LABOUR'S POLISHED SHERIFF SAID SHE WELCOMED THE DEAL BUT THE TEMPERATURE SOON WENT UP AGAIN WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO
TO OFFER OUR HEARTFELT AND SINCERE APOLOGY FOR THE SIGNIFICANT AND SEVERE DISTRESS
HAS BEEN CAUSED TO PATIENTS AS A RESULT OF THIS PROLONGED DISPUTE

REPORTING FROM HEREFORD THE TIME EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S GO A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH NOW BECAUSE WITH JUST OVER A MONTH TO GO TIME BEGINNING TO RUN OUT FOR THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM VOTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY DID WE ALREADY ARE HEARING FROM BOATERS AROUND THE COUNTRY THEY MAKE UP THEIR MINDS AND THIS MORNING ROSS HAWKINS IS IN GREATER MANCHESTER AND AT THE MOMENT HE'S ON THE GOLF COURSE IS THAT RIGHT ROSS WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING

PASSING FREIGHT TRAIN AND A WORRYING QUESTION I THINK FOR THE CAMPAIGNS WITH LETTERS AND PRESS RELEASES AND EVENTS IN INTERVIEWS AND OCCASIONAL FURIES THEY CANNOT KNOW JUST WHAT DIFFERENCE ALL THAT POLITICAL ACTIVITY ACTUALLY MAKES TO TO VOTERS' VIEWS THERE'S A BUSINESS BREAKFAST GOING ON HERE AS THEY MOVED SOME OF THE GREENS BEHIND ME
LET'S GET SOME OF THE VIEWS FROM HERE FRANCIS KENNEDY IS HE'S WITH ME WHAT I'M MOST INTERESTED IN IS HOW MUCH WEIGHT YOU PUT ON THE POLITICIANS THAT YOU HEAR ON A PROGRAMME DAY IN DAY OUT DO THEY CONVINCE YOU ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
THE HONEST ANSWER IS NO THEY DON'T CONVINCE ME THAT MAY THINK HE'S AT THE THROWING A BOT OUT THERE YOU JOBS WILL CHANGE THE ECONOMY WILL CHANGE EXPORTS WILL CHANGE BUT HOW
THERE'S MAKING SO MANY STATEMENTS I JUST WANT THE FACTS THE FACTS TRACY WHICH THEY DO THEM A FAVOUR INSURANCE BROKING BUSINESS NEAR HERE WHAT WOULD THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO TO CHANGE YOUR MIND YOU'RE RELATIVELY UNDECIDED WHAT CONVINCES YOU ONE WAY OR THE OTHER OH MY INDECISION IS LAW IT COMES ABOUT BECAUSE I I HEAR LOTS OF INDECISION INTO PARTY I DON'T HEAR ANY CLEAR

SAN FRANCISCO'S POLICE CHIEF GREG'S SUR HAS RESIGNED OURS AFTER ONE OF HIS OFFICERS SHOT DEAD A BLACK WOMAN THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE BY POLICE FORCES AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS HAS PROVOKED PROTESTS AROUND THE COUNTRY LED TO CHICAGO'S POLICE CHIEF BEING FIRED AND DECEMBER REPORTING FROM LOS ANGELES DAVID WILLIS
PRESSURE HAS BEEN MOUNTING FOR GREG'S RESIGNATION SINCE LAST DECEMBER WHEN FIVE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE OFFICERS SHOT AND KILLED A YOUNG BLACK MAN CARRYING A KNIFE MARIA WOODS WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN HIT BY MORE THAN TWENTY BULLETS SIX OF THEM IN THE BACK BUT THE CITY'S MAYOR ED LEAD BACK TO THE CHIEF THEN
AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HIM WHEN IT WAS DISCLOSED THAT SEVERAL OFFICERS HAD EXCHANGED RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC TEXT MESSAGES BUT THE SHOOTING OF A TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO'D CRASHED A STOLEN CAR INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE MADE THE POLICE CHIEF'S POSITION UNTENABLE MISTER LEVY SAID CHANGES TO THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT WERE CLEARLY NOT HAPPENING FAST ENOUGH
DAVID WILLIS REPORTING THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN LET'S GET THE LATEST NOW ON THE EFFORT TO ESTABLISH EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EGYPT AIR JET THE CRASHED OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN YESTERDAY THERE'S BEEN REPORTS THAT WRECKAGE HAD BEEN FOUND BUT THE GREEK AUTHORITIES ARE NOW SAYING THEY DON'T THINK THAT'S ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PLANE LET'S TALK FIRST NO HE'S A CORRESPONDENT IS IN ATHENS AT THE MOMENT OF THE GREEK AUTHORITIES SAYING THIS MORNING
WELL THERE ARE FEW NEW LINES FROM THE GREEK AUTHORITIES BUT WHAT THEY HAVE REALLY BEEN CLEARING UP IS THAT IDEA THAT THE WRECKAGE THAT WAS FOUND LATE YESTERDAY WAS FROM THIS MISSING AIRCRAFT THEY SAY THAT ACTUALLY THE LIFE JACKETS AND THE PLASTIC THAT WERE PLUCKED FROM THE SEA WELL NOT FROM A PLANE AT ALL THAT'S COMING FROM GREECE IS LEAD AIR ACCIDENT INVESTIGATOR THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THEIR LIFE JACKETS THEY'RE LEFT BY MIGRANTS AS THEY HAVE BEEN SO MANY OF THOSE IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
IN A RECENT MONTHS BUT A LOT OF THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE LAST KNOWN MOVEMENTS OF THIS FLIGHT SATO FORWARD SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD IS COMING FROM THE GREEKS BECAUSE
THE PLANE HAD JUST LEFT GREEK AIRSPACE WHEN IT DISAPPEARED AND IT'S A CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITIES HAVE SAID THAT EVERYTHING APPEARED NORMAL AS THIS PLANE PASSED THROUGH GREEK AIR SPACE THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE PILOT TOLD THE CONTROLLED AND ATHENS THANKS IN GREEK HE SEEMED IN A GOOD MOOD THE LAST TIME THEY SPOKE TO HIM THEN THEY TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO TALK
AND FAILED AS HE WAS LEAVING GREEK AIRSPACE THEY TRIED EVEN ON EMERGENCY FREQUENCIES AND IT WAS TEN TO FIFTEEN MILES INTO EGYPTIAN AIRSPACE THAT THEIR RADAR SIGNALS LOST TRACK OF THE PLANE THAN THE DEFENCE MINISTER INCREASE TALKS ABOUT HOW THE MILITARY RADAR WHICH CAN LOOK AT LOWER ALTITUDES AND ACTUALLY SPOTTED THIS AIRBUS A. THREE TWENTY MAKING
SWERVES BASICALLY SHUT MAKING A SHARP TURN NINETY DEGREES TO THE LEFT THEN THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREES TO THE RIGHT BEFORE IT DROPPED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FEET AND THEY ASSUME PLUNGED INTO THE SEA SO NOW ALL THE EFFORT IS BACK ON THE SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION WHICH IS TAKING PLACE BETWEEN THE SOUTHERN MOST GREEK ISLANDS AND THE EGYPTIAN COAST
THANKS LET'S TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION WITH GRAHAM BRAITHWAITE IS DIRECTOR OF SAFETY AN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION OF THIS HIT HIM FROM THE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION CENTRE AT CRANFIELD UNIVERSITY'S ON THAT LINE A GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING I'M A BIT I SUPPOSE THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW LARGE THE AREA IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT WAS A SOME QUITE PRECISE INFORMATION ISN'T THERE ABOUT WHERE THE PLANE IS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS QUITE HIGH AND I SUPPOSE IT DID HE WOULD HAVE TO STILL BE SEARCHING A FAIRLY LARGE AREA
THAT'S RIGHT CERTAINLY IS THE LAST POSITION WAS AT HEIGHT AND IF THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT GOING IN A STRAIGHT LINE THEN OBVIOUSLY IT COULD BE QUITE A WIDE SEARCH AREA ALSO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR DEBRIS ON THE SEA SURFACE THEN THERE'S SAY WERE MOVED AS WELL SO YOU TEND TO SEARCH IN A GRID PATTERN AND TRY AND NARROW DOWN THE SEARCH
USING AIRCRAFT TO DO THAT AND THAT THAT OFTEN TAKES A WHILE TO GET ASSEMBLED AND GET STARTED AND IS IT RIGHT THAT IF IT HAD BROKEN UP IN THE AIR DID TO COMMON SENSE WOULD TELL YOU THAT THAT THE PIECES FROM THE PLANE WOULD BE OVER A WIDER AREA IN A SENSE MIGHT BE EASIER TO TO FIND IS THAT IS THAT THE CASE CERTAINLY IN PAST ACCIDENTS WHERE PERHAPS THERE'S BEEN AN EXPLOSION ALTITUDE OR HAS TO BREAK UP THAN TEN YES THAT THE WRECKAGE TENDS TO SCATTER ITSELF OVER A MUCH LARGER PATTERN
BECAUSE SOME THINGS ARE HEAVIER SOME SOME CLOAKING TUMBLE AS THEY COME DOWN TO THE SURFACE SO YES YOU MIGHT EXPECT A LARGER PATTERN ALSO LOOK FOR SOMETHING LIKE A FUEL SPILL ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AS WELL
AND WHAT ABOUT SATELLITE IMAGERY BECAUSE WE WERE HEARING OVERNIGHT THAT THE UNITED STATES THAT SEVERAL AGENCIES PARTICULARLY U.S. MILITARY AGENCIES HAD BEEN SAYING THEY'D LOOKED AT THEIR SATELLITE COVERAGE OF THAT AREA AT THE TIME THAT THE PLANE WENT DOWN AND THEY COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING WOULD WORK HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT DOES WHAT THEY COME UP WITH WILL BE USEFUL IT CAN BE A GREAT TOOL FOR FINDING THINGS BUT ACTUALLY THE SEA MAKES IT QUITE COMPLICATED
ALTHOUGH SATELLITE IMAGERY BE GOOD IF IF YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ON LAND ACTUALLY IF THERE'S DEBRIS IN THE WATER CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT SO AT LEAST IT'S IN A PART OF THE WORLD WHERE YOU MIGHT FIND THAT THERE'S MILITARY SATELLITES LOOKING AT THAT AREA I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISED THAT IT HASN'T PICKED ANYTHING UP AND THE OTHER THING CAUSES THE BLACK BOX WHICH HAS AN ABILITY DOESN'T IT HAD TO COMMUNICATE AUTOMATICALLY WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD HOW HOW CLOSE WOULD YOU HAVE TO BE TO IT IN IN ORDER TO TO PICK UP ITS SIGNAL
SINCE THERE'S TWO POSSIBILITIES ONE A THING CALLED AN EMERGENCY LOCATER TRANSMITTER WHICH ON AN AIRCRAFT SHOULD ACTIVATE WHEN IT ENTERS THE WATER BUTT BUT NOTORIOUSLY THEY SAIL OR A BROKEN BY IMPACT SO THEN YOU RELY ON A BEACON ON THE FLIGHT DATA RECORDER
HAPPY YOU HAVE TO BE QUITE CLOSE TO PICK THAT UP SO MAYBE WITHIN FIVE KILOMETRES AND BEARING IN MIND IF THE DEBT TO THE SEA IN THIS AREA'S MAYBE TWO OR THREE KILOMETRES HAVE THEM THAT GIVES YOU A VERY NARROW FIELD ON THE SURFACE AND SO YOU DO HAVE TO BE PRETTY CLOSE TO WHERE YOU THINK THE WRECKAGE IS TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP THAT PICTURE
BRAITHWAITE FROM CRUMPLED UNIVERSITY THANKS VERY MUCH IT IS FORTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN OH HOSPITAL MANAGERS UNDER PRESSURE TO COOK THE BOOKS IN ORDER TO MASK THE SIZE OF A RECORD DEFICIT FACING THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND AS THE CLAY MADE BY A WHISTLE BLOWER EXPLAINED TO THE B.B.C. FIGURES OUT LATER TODAY ARE EXPECTED TO CONFIRM THAT THE DEFICIT IS RUNNING A MUCH MORE THAN TWO BILLION POUNDS IF IT GOES TOO HIGH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WOULD FACE THE EMBARRASSMENT OF HAVING TO ASK THE TREASURY FOR MID YEAR INJECTION OF EMERGENCY FUNDS
WOULD YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THAT BY DAVID BENNETT THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OR MONITOR THAT'S THE BODY RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING N.H.S. FOUNDATION TRUST MORNING TO YOU DOES IT WORRY YOU THE REPORTS OF WHAT A WHISTLE BLOW YOUR CALLS ACCOUNTING ALCHEMY THE SUGGESTION THAT CAPITAL FUNDS ARE BEING USED TO MASK THE DEFICIT INVESTMENT FUNDS IN OTHER WORDS THE SUGGESTION THAT HE WAS OF ACCOUNTANTS ARE GOING IN TO SQUEEZE THE BOOKS JUST TO MAKE THE FIGURES FIT NATIONAL TARGETS
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN WHEN WE GET THE FIGURES LATER TODAY FOR HOW MUCH THE N.H.S. HOSPITALS HAVE ORGANISATIONS OR SPENT IT WELL THEY WILL BE IN DEFICIT TO LIVING EXTENT WHICH IS OVER TWO BILLION POUNDS THE D.H. APARTMENT HELL'S GOING TO FIND A WAY OF FUNDING THAT AND FOR CERTAIN THEY WILL BE SCRAMBLING AROUND TRYING TO FIND EVERY LITTLE BUDGET ELSEWHERE THAT IS UNDER SPENT TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THE NUMBERS ALL ADD UP PART OF THAT IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE EVERY HOSPITAL HAS DONE
EVERYTHING IT CAN TO MINIMISE ADEPT AT THAT EATS DEFICITS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THAT WHAT WOULD WORRY PEOPLE AS IF THIS IS FIDDLING THE NUMBERS IN OTHER WORDS HE'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT HOW THE N.H.S. SPENDS ITS MONEY IT'S HOW IT SEEMS TO BE SPENDING ITS MONEY YES I THINK THE TWO ASPECTS OF THIS FOR IN ANY PROCESS OF FINALISING THE YEAR END ACCOUNTS WHICH IS WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW
YOU HAVE TO MAKE JUDGEMENTS ON THINGS LIKE IF YOU IF YOU'VE GOT A CONTRACT DISPUTE AND YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH MONEY A SUPPLIER YOU MAY BE IN DISPUTE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW THAT FOR A FINAL SETTLEMENT AND PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT HOW MUCH THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHAT WOULD ALARM PEOPLE THOUGH IS THIS ISN'T IT IF PEOPLE ARE BEING PAID LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN ORDER TO GO IN TO N.H.S. TRUSSES DON'T PUT THAT NUMBER
PUT THIS NUMBER NOW ACCORDING TO OUR WHISTLE BLOWER WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IT IS QUOTE UNPRECEDENTED IN MY THIRTY YEAR FINANCE CAREER EVERY SAYS TO FIND THESE ACCOUNTANTS GOING IN SAY NO YOU'VE BEEN TOO GENEROUS IN THE BOX WHY DON'T YOU JUST SQUEEZE IT A LITTLE I THINK IT IS UNPRECEDENTED AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE THE SCALE OF THE DEFICIT WHICH THEY'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH IS UNPRECEDENTED BUT HOWEVER TIME THEREFORE JUST TO SAY ACTUALLY WE'RE IN DEFICIT BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH MONEY'S BEEN SPENT ON HEALTH
YOU COULD SAY THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE HEALTH HEALTH HAS NOT FOUND ENOUGH EFFICIENCIES THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF EFFICIENCY THAT WAS NEEDED HASN'T BEEN FOUND I THINK THE REAL ISSUE IS GOING FORWARD WILL THERE BE ENOUGH
THE N.H.S. ASKED FOR EXTRA MONEY OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THE GOVERNMENT GAVE THEM MORE OR LESS WHAT THEY ASKED FOR WELL MORE OR LESS WHAT THEY ASKED FOR THE SECOND TIME OF ASKING BECAUSE DAVID LAWS MEMOIRS FORMER LIBERAL DEMOCRAT COALITION MINISTER REVEALED THAT SIMON STEVENS THE CHIEF EXEC OF THE ENERGIES CHANGED HIS DEMAND WHEN IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO HIM THAT THAT WAS NOT WHAT HE WAS GOING TO GET I THINK THAT'S DISPUTED THAT
HE EVEN SO THEY THEY FINISHED UP ASKING FOR ABOUT EIGHT BILLION POUNDS EXTRA BY THE END OF FIVE YEARS THEY WERE GIVEN ABOUT EIGHT THEY ASKED FOR MORE MONEY UP FRONT THEY WERE GIVEN MORE MONEY UPFRONT HOWEVER TO MAKE THOSE NUMBERS ADD UP THEY MADE CONTINUING VERY AMBITIOUS EFFICIENCY ASSUMPTIONS AND THAT I THINK IT'S A REAL TALENT FOR THE N.H.S. CAN IS ACHIEVE THOSE EFFICIENCY ASSUMPTION IS CHALLENGE VERY BRIEFLY KO'D FOR NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT
VERY SIMPLE WAY OF LOOKING AT THIS AT THE END OF THE FIVE YEARS THEY'LL BE SPENDING WE'LL BE SPENDING ABOUT TWO THIRDS THE AMOUNTS ON THE N.H.S. THAT MOST COUNTRIES SIMILAR COUNTRIES SPENT CANYON O'SHEA S.P. THAT MUCH MORE EFFICIENT DAVID BENNETT THANK YOU
EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN A EUROSTAR PUT COURTLY RESULTS DAY ROBERT HIS HAIR WITH THAT YES THAT EUROSTAR WHICH RUNS THE PASSENGER TRAIN THROUGH THE CHANNEL TUNNEL FROM LONDON TO PARIS BRUSSELS AND ELSEWHERE HAS REPORTED A. THREE PER CENT FALL IN PASSENGER NUMBERS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR IT'S BLAMING THE TERROR ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS WILL WITH US EXECUTIVE NIKOLAI PETROVITCH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SO ARE PEOPLE FEARFUL OF GOING TO BRUSSELS AND PARIS
PEOPLE COMING FROM THE FROM THE U.K. EVERY BOND IT'S QUITE QUICKLY SO HE STOOD THERE POLAND APPALLING WE HAVE IS PEOPLE COMING FROM SOUTH EAST ASIA AS BESHLEY JAPAN NO DIFF YOU'RE FULL OF COMING TO EUROPE AT ALL SO THE IDYLLS REALLY WAS GOING ON SO THEY'D RATHER GO ELSEWHERE SO THAT SWEATS IMPACTING ON NUMBERS MOST I WOULD SAY RIGHT HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THIS WILL LAST
THE EXPERIENCE OF THE BOMBINGS IN LONDON IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE SHOWS THAT I MEAN IF THINGS GO BACK TO NORMAL TAKES TWELVE MONTHS IT WOULD BE TOUGH FOR THIS YEAR AND HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR INTERNATIONAL VISITORS WOULD COME BACK RIGHT NOW THERE ARE QUESTIONS BEING ASKED TODAY ABOUT AIRPORT SECURITY IN PARIS AFTER THE CRASH OF AN EGYPT AIR JET YESTERDAY HAS SECURITY BEEN STEPPED UP IN THE TRAIN STATIONS IN FRANCE THAT YOU USE I MEAN THEY WERE STEPPED UP
AFTER THE NOVEMBER NOVEMBER YOUR CONCERN WE HAVE ALREADY A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF SECURITY FOR RAY'S SERVICE BECAUSE WE CHECKED EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER GOING ON BOARD UNDER STAFF AND EVERYTHING SO BUT YES LARRY WITHOUT SIN FRONDS BENT TO SECURITY AND PUBLIC PLACES HAS BEEN STEPPED UP O.K. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE E.U. REFERENDUM IF THE U.K. VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT IMPACT WOULD THAT HAVE ON EUROSTAR
THE FIRST THING BACK THERE WAS THIS SHOT TERM IS THE UNCERTAINTY UNFORTUNATELY MIGHT LEAD TO ECONOMY CURE POTENTIALLY RECESSION THIS WHAT WE SEE AT THE MOMENT IN THE LONG TERM IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW BECAUSE THERE IS NO CLEAR
BRIE WITH THE WITH BRICKS IT WOULD MEAN SO WE DO LIKE NO WEARING DEATH CHEESE DAY'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE FOR HER SOUL WOULD BE MORE LIKE EAMONN OR ICELAND AND THEN THERE COULD BE AN IMPACT FOR US ON THE WAY WE OPERATE BECAUSE TO DID YOU HELPS US IT SIMPLIFIES A BUSINESS SO IT COULD BECOME MORE COMPLETE BETHAN BAYS WHICH WE HAPPENED TO EAT
BUT IN TERMS OF THAT THE PASSENGER EXPERIENCE SURELY IT WILL BE NO MORE HASSLE IN A FEW YEARS IF WE LEAVE THAT IT WOULD BE TODAY NO BECAUSE BOTH COUPLES ARE ALREADY IN PLACE IT'S MORE THEY'LL BE EXPECTING IT COMMUNITIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CHANNEL SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND ALSO THERE ARE MANY COMPANIES FRENCH OR BRITISH ESTABLISHED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CHANNEL SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM
YOU ARE A TESTING I THINK OF RAIL SERVICE LONDON AND AMSTERDAM WHEN MIGHT THIS BE UP AND RUNNING SO WE'RE GOING TO START OR SO HE SAID THE END OF NEXT YEAR WE HAVE A BRONZE YOU TRAIN A NEW FLEET OF TRAINS GOING TO RUN DIRECTLY FROM LONDON TO UM SORT OF SEVENTEEN THERE AND IT WOULD BE A FOIL JOHNNY TIME WE EXPECT TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING ON THAT'S NICE AND WILL THIS SERVICE STILL GO AHEAD IF THE U.K. IT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION YES SEE TO IT
NOW YOU ARE TWENTY SIX FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT WILL BE HELD IN FRANCE LATER THIS YEAR I THINK YOUR BANNING ALCOHOL ON ON SOME OF THE TRAIN THAT ENCOURAGE PERHAPS HEAVIER DRINKING BEFORE THE JOURNEY'S OR PERHAPS PUT PEOPLE OFF USING YOU AT ALL
I MEAN WE ALL WITH YOU HAVE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TICKETS SOLD TO SO I THINK HE PUT A VERY INTERESTING IT'S THE BEST WAY TO GO TO THE GAMES AT THE MOMENT SO FOR YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT IT'S MORE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS WHICH WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND WE DO DATON CONJUNCTIONS RES THE BRITISH POLICE IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE OH KAY THANK YOU NICOLA PETROVICH
THANK YOU A BIRD TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE REFERENDUM DEBATE WILL END IN MANCHESTER AT SAY THAT THE RESULT WILL BE DECLARED AND THAT'S WHERE ROSS HAWKINS IS FOR US THIS MORNING HE'S BEEN LOOKING AT MY OTHER THINGS WHETHER BRITAIN AND ONE ICONIC MANCHESTER PROJECT WOULD MISS OUT ON MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF INVESTMENT FROM AN E.U. INVESTMENT BANK IF WE WERE TO VOTE TO LEAVE
CHEAP MONEY FOR SCHOOLS FOR HOSPITALS FOR TRANSPORT IT SOUNDS LIKE A POLITICIAN'S HEADLINE PROMISE
IT'S MADE BY THE BIGGEST E.U. INSTITUTION YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK WHICH IS PROVIDING HALF A BILLION POUNDS HERE FOR THE TRAM SYSTEM ALONE A LOT OF HARD CORE BEING IMPORTANT
A MANCHESTER STREET SIR RICHARD LEASE LABOUR LEADER OF THE CITY COUNCIL WATCHES SOME OF THE WORK YOU COME BACK IN THERE
IN PROBABLY ABOUT SIX MONTHS THIS WILL BE TRAM TRACKS RUNNING THROUGH IF WE LEFT THE E.U. THIS CONTINUE BUT THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY SIGNIFICANT NEW PROJECT WAS HERE
RICHARD LEASE THAT WOULD MADE IN THE FUTURE THAT IF WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING ON THIS SCALE AND WE UNDOUBTEDLY WE'LL NEED TO DO MORE THINGS ON THIS SORT OF SCALE WITH A GREATER MANCHESTER IT WILL MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT GIVES GOOD VALUE
COUNCIL TAX PAYERS AND THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK DOES BUSINESS ON A BIG SCALE MORE THAN FIVE BILLION POUNDS IT LOANED IN THE U.K. LAST YEAR THERE'S BEEN MONEY FOR SOCIAL HOUSING UNIVERSITY PROJECTS FOR WIND TURBINES FOR HOSPITAL
BUT IT'S A BANK NOT SANTA THESE ALONE'S NOT GIFTS THEY SUPPORT FUNDING FROM OTHER SOURCES AND THE BANK BORROWS TO LEN WITH MORE THAN THREE BILLION POUNDS OF BRITISH
SATIN IT'S COFFERS AND THE ABILITY TO CALL ON MUCH MORE A TRANS HERE IN MANCHESTER BEFORE WE KNOCK KNOCK THEM DOWN AND KNOW HAD TO REPLY
FOR MONEY FROM THE IVY'S TAKING A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE WORKS HERE STEPHEN WOLF THE LOCAL UKIP M.E.P. RICHARD LEASE IS WRONG TO SUGGEST THAT BIG INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
WHETHER IT'S HERE OR IN OTHER PLACES IN EUROPE WOULDN'T GET FUNDED IT JUST WOULDN'T GET FUNDED BY THE E.I. BE WOULD GET FUNDED BY OUR OWN GOVERNMENTS AND WHAT RICHARD WOULD HAVE TO DO IS PERSUADE OUR OWN GOVERNMENTS THAT THERE IS A REAL REASON FOR HAVING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
SO COULDN'T THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT PUT ITS OWN MONEY INTO ITS OWN FUND AND MAKE ITS OWN DECISIONS A POINT I PUT TO JONATHAN TAYLOR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK
I AM MAKING THE ARGUMENT SET BOARD MEMBERS OF INSTITUTIONS LIKE MINE ALL WEEK WHO ARE NOMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED AND ALL OF WHOM ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE GOVERNMENTS
WILL BE MAKING HIS DECISIONS TAKING FULL ACCOUNT OF WHAT THESE GOVERNMENTS WHAT CAN YOUR BANK MAKE A BETTER SET OF DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO INVEST THAN ELECTED MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER I WOULD NEVER PRESUME TO THAT WE CAN DO ANYTHING BETTER THE ELECTED MEMBER OF
WHY NOT JUST DEVOLVE THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES BACK TO WESTMINSTER I THINK IF YOU WANT WANTED DEAD TO SET UP A BANK RUN BY ELECTING M.P.S THEN THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE HER HEAD
MANCHESTER MAY SOUND CONTINENTAL THESE DAYS EVEN THE BUSKERS
BUT IF THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK DOESN'T PRESUME IT DOESN'T SHOUT TOO LOUD EITHER ON THIS SHINY NEW TRAM PLATFORM AT LEAST
A GLIMPSE OF AN E.U. FLAG
LENDING BILLIONS OF POUNDS IS ONE THING GETTING NOTICED DOING IT AND HAVING ANY IMPACT AT ALL
IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN QUITE ANOTHER
ROSS HAWKINS REPORTING FROM MANCHESTER HE'S WRITTEN AN ARTICLE FOR THE B. B. C. WEBSITE WITH MORE ON THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM ROSS IN MANCHESTER AT HALF PAST EIGHT AND ALSO WORTH PLUGGING AT THIS POINT THE B.B.C.'S REALITY CHECK WEBSITE ADDRESS WE WERE HEARING EARLIER ON THE PROGRAMME PEOPLE SAY THEY JUST WANT THE FACTS WELL WE'VE HAD A STAB AT JUST PROVIDING THE FACTS IT'S B.

ON TOP THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT HEAD TO HEAD WITH MARIE LEADING INTO THAT MATCH HE HAD LOST ELEVEN OF THE TWELVE ONLY BEATEN HIM ONCE SINCE HE WON WIMBLEDON IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN SO IT WAS A BIG BOOST FOR MO MENTALLY YEAH HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN ONCE YOU GET INTO THAT LOSING GROOVE EVERY TIME DO YOU THINK OH NO NOT HIM OR YOU HAVE CERTAIN PLAYERS YOU JUST DON'T LIKE PLAYING IN NOBODY REALLY LIKES PLAYING JOCK OF IT BUT FOR HIM TO WIN IN ROM SHOWS THAT I CAN DO IT ON THE BIG STAGE I CAN DO IT ON CLAY

BRITISH PUBLIC SIZE AND I THINK SHE'S GOT THE GAME SHE'S GOT A SPANISH COACH SHE LIKES THE SURFACE AND IF SHE CAN TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF HERSELF I THINK SECOND WEEK PERFORMANCE AGAIN WOULD BE BRILLIANT RESULT OH K. TWO QUICK FINAL THOUGHT SHE MENTIONED ROUGHEN A DOL A GREAT CHAMPION BUT THIS YEAR

PRESSURES SHE'S FORCE TO GO IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER A NEW SERIES OF ANALYSIS BEGINS WITH BEYOND BINARY ON MONDAY EVENING AT EIGHT THIRTY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR
QUICK LOOK AT THE WEATHER RAY DRY DAY FOR MOST RAIN ARRIVING LATER COVERS NING TODAY ON RADIO FOUR AND NICK ROBINSON OR JUST TO READ THE TIME IS HARPER SEVEN AND KATHY KLAXONS HERE WITH A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS THE R.A.F. THE ROYAL FLEET AUXILIARY SHIP HAVE JOINED THE SEARCH FOR AN EGYPTIAN AIRLINER WHICH DISAPPEARED OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN YESTERDAY SIXTY SIX PEOPLE WERE ON BOARD FLIGHT M.S. EIGHT OH FOUR FROM PARIS TO CAIRO
THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES HAVE BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER THERE WAS A SECURITY BREACH A CHILD A GOAL AIRPORT RELATIVES OF THE PASSENGERS HAVE BEGUN ARRIVING IN EGYPT WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED FOR THE SEARCH TO BE INTENSIFIED
AN N.H.S. WHISTLEBLOWER SAYS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS BEEN USING UNORTHODOX MEASURES TO MASK THE SIZE OF THE N.H.S. DEFICIT FIGURES DUE OUT LATER TODAY ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW AN UNPRECEDENTED OVERSPEND BY HOSPITALS AMBULANCE SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH TRUSTS IN ENGLAND IN THE YEAR TO MARCH
THE NIGERIAN MILITARY SAYS IT'S RESCUED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED WOMEN AND GIRLS WHO ARE BEING HELD BY BOKO HARAM MILITANTS IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY AND ARMY SPOKESMAN SAID ONE OF THE SCHOOLGIRLS WHO WAS KIDNAPPED FROM THE TIME OF QI BOOK TWO YEARS AGO WAS FREED IN THE OPERATION
ALMOST THREE HUNDRED LEADING FIGURES IN THE ARTS WORLD HAVE SIGNED A LETTER BACKING HER VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE SIGNATORIES INCLUDING THE ACTOR BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH THE AUTHOR JOHN THE CARRY AND THE POET LAUREATE CAROL ANN DUFFY I'LL GIVE THAT BRITAIN IS MORE IMAGINATIVE AND CREATIVE INSIDE THE E.U.
COUNCILLORS IN NORTH YORKSHIRE OR MEET LATER TO DISCUSS WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE AN APPLICATION FOR FRACKING ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND RESIDENTS IN THE VILLAGE OF KIRKBY MISS BRITAIN WHERE THE FRACKING IS PROPOSED A AGAINST THE MOVE THE PROCESS WAS BANNED IN THE U.K. IN TWENTY ELEVEN AFTER IT CAUSED MINOR EARTHQUAKES NEAR BLACKPOOL
NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS IN ENGLAND WERE FORCED TO TRAVEL TO FIND A HOSPITAL BED LAST YEAR THAT'S A RISE OF THIRTEEN PERCENT ON THE PREVIOUS YEAR SOME WERE TREATED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILES FROM HOME THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS PROMISED TO END THE PRACTICE
RESTRICTIONS ON CIGARETTE PACKETS WILL COME INTO FORCE TODAY NEW PACKS WILL BE UNIFORMLY GREEN WITH GRAPHIC HEALTH WARNINGS TOBACCO COMPANIES HAVE A YEAR TO SELL OLD STOCK AND FULLY IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES THANK YOU KATHY IT IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT HAVE THE COURT'S CREATED WHAT IS IN EFFECT A FULL ON PRIVACY LAW EVEN THOUGH PARLIAMENT IS NOT ACTUALLY LEGISLATED FOR ONE THAT'S THE VERDICT ON ONE SENIOR LAWYER AFTER YESTERDAY SUPREME COURT VERDICT PROTECTING THE IDENTITY OF A CELEBRITY ALLEGED TO HAVE PARTICIPATED
IN AN EXTRAMARITAL THREESOME THE NAME OF THAT PUBLIC FIGURES BEEN DISCLOSED IN SCOTLAND THE UNITED STATES IS WIDELY AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET BUT THE JUDGES RULED THAT YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO OVERTURN AN INJUNCTION DENYING NEWSPAPERS THE SUN ON SUNDAY IN PARTICULAR THE RIGHT TO PUBLISH THAT NAME WILL JOIN ON THE LINE NOW BYE KIRST INSURABLE A MAP BARRISTER MATRIX CHAMBERS WHO SPECIALISES IN MEDIA AND INFORMATION LAW IS THAT WHAT WE'VE GOT IN EFFECT A PRIVACY LAW
I THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THAT THE RIGHT THAT THE TAUGHT OF MISSUS A PRIVATE INFORMATION HAS ALREADY BEEN RECOGNISED IN ENGLISH LAW I DON'T THINK IT'S CORRECT TO SAY THAT THE JUDGES HAVE SOMEHOW CREATED SOME NEW BEAST OF LAW AND I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING PARTICULARLY UNUSUAL ABOUT THE JUDGE'S ANALYSIS OF THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF THOSE INVOLVED MAYBE IT'S NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST NEVER SHOULD BE PRINTED
IN THE SUPREME COURT PROCEED ON THE SAME BASIS AS THE COURT OF APPEAL AND WILD THAT THE SUN'S LAWYERS SAID THAT THEY WOULD MAINTAIN A PUBLIC INTEREST DEFENCE IT AT TRIAL HE DIDN'T SEEK TO PERSUADE THE SUPREME COURT TO RULE OTHERWISE BUT ISN'T THE IMPACT THE SAME AS HAVING A PRIVACY LAW SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE PRINTABLE INDEED HAS BEEN PRINTED IN SCOTLAND LET ALONE ABROAD IN THE UNITED STATES FOR EXAMPLE IS WIDELY AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET CANNOT BE READ IN ENGLAND AND WALES
I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING ABOUT THIS JUDGEMENT IT IS THAT REALLY WHAT IT FOCUSED ON WAS WAS WHAT THEY SAID WAS A QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEDIUM IN WHICH IT WOULD BE PRINTED IF IT WAS ALLOWS THE INJUNCTION WAS LIFTED IN THE U.K. SO SAYING THAT THE IMPACT ON ON THEIR PRIVACY RIGHTS OR DISTINGUISHING THERE BETWEEN A BREACH OF CONFIDENCE AND THE TORTOISE MESSY SURPRISE INFORMATION BOTH OF WHICH HAVE EXISTED IN ENGLISH LAW FOR FOR SOME TIME
THERE WELL DONE JUDGE OF COURSE WHO WAS CRITICAL LORD TOLSON IN THE SUPREME COURT SAID ONCE THE STORY BECOME READILY AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY WHO WANTED TO KNOW IF IT HAS LOST THE ESSENCE OF CONFIDENTIALITY HE WENT ON WE MUST LIVE IN THE WORLD AS IT IS NOT AS WE WOULD LIKE IT YES AND HE ALSO QUERIED WHETHER THEY ARE IN FACT WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION BEING SUBJECTIVE GOSSIP ON THE INTERNET TWITTER
BLOGGS THOSE SORTS OF MEDIUM AND THE IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE IF IT WERE PUBLISHED ON THE FRONT PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK THAT ARGUMENT I'M NOT SURE THAT ACTUALLY IT'S RIGHT TO SAY THAT THE IMPACT OF THE STORY IS E. SIGNIFICANTLY LESS
IF IT'S IF IT'S PUBLISHED ONLINE AND YOU THINK I THINK THAT IGNORES THE FULL FORCE OF GLOBAL JOURNALISM I NOT LIKE MEDIA IN TERMS OF THE LEGAL OPTIONS NOW OPEN IT IS STRASBOURG WOULD BE THE NEXT OPTION IS IT OUT OF EBEN WRIGHT YES IT'S STRASBOURG OR ALL OR IT HAS TO WAIT FOR A CASE LIKE THIS TO WORK AS WET SUPREME COURT AGAIN DIFFICULTY WITH THESE CASES ESTATE THEY WILL TURN ON THEIR OWN FACTS AND YOU THINK THERE'S ANY LIKELIHOOD THAT STRASBERG WOULD OVERTURN THIS
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY I MEAN THE THING IS THAT THE COURTS VERY GONE IN GONE INTO SOME CONSIDERABLE DETAIL AND EXAMINED BAIT BOTH WRITES A CLAY SO WHETHER THE STRASBOURG COURT WILL BE WILLING TO INTERFERE WITH THAT ANALYSIS IT IS QUESTIONABLE SORT SO I'M NOT SURE THAT STRASBOURG REALLY IS EITHER OPTION BUT WE'LL SEE IF THIS INJUNCTION MAY MAY CONTINUE TO TO TO TO TO CREATE INTEREST AND AND AND LEGAL ARGUMENT THE OTHER POSSIBILITY OF COURSE IS THE PARLIAMENT REVISITS THIS AND TRIES TO WIND IN THE RIGHT TO THE PUBLIC
THAT IS A POSSIBILITY I'M NOT SURE HOW LIKELY POSSIBILITY THAT HE'S THERE'S BEEN MUCH MEDIA STORM AROUND THIS CASE OF COURSE IT STILL HAS TO PROCEED TO TRIAL IT WHICH IT WHICH POINT DATE THESE SPLITTING THE FINAL INJECTION WILL BE DECIDED SO IT'S NOT QUITE DEAD IN THE WATER YET JUST IN SUMMARY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BAFFLED AS TO WHY THE SCOTTISH COURT MIGHT SEE IT ONE WAY IN AN ENGLISH COURT OR RATHER SUPREME COURT CASES IN ANOTHER WAY WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THAT
DIFFERENT DIFF DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS APPLY SO ITS OWN INJUNCTION THAT THAT SAM IS IN FORCE IN ENGLAND AND WALES WOULD NOT HAVE A FACT IN SCOTLAND
BUT IT COULD IN THEORY HAVE BEEN PURSUED IN SCOTLAND IT JUST WASN'T IT COULD JUST HAPPENS IT WASN'T SO IS NOT ABOUT A DIFFERENT NATURE OF THE LAW IN THE TWO COUNTRIES THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES BUT THAT'S BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT THAT IT SUITS IT'S THAT IT'S FOR THAT REASON IT HASN'T SCOTLAND JUST FINALLY EXPRESSED SCEPTICISM THIS WAS A FULL ON PRIVACY LAW UP AFTER THAT IS ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES AND YOUR OWN CHAMBERS ANTHONY HUDSON Q.C. WHO'S PROVIDED THAT QUOTE FROM BEIJING DAILY TELEGRAPH
ANTHONY HAD SOME I'M SURE THAT HE TAKES DIFFERENT VIEW AH NO I DISAGREE I DON'T THINK IT'S I DON'T THINK IT'S A FULL ON PRIVACY LAW IN THE SENSE THAT THEY HAD SUPREME COURT HAS DONE SOMETHING WILDLY DIFFERENT AND TO THE COURT FOR IT
WHOLE POINT TO DIFFERENT WAYS DIFFERENT OPINIONS CAUSE TROUBLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT NO QUESTION ABOUT THE OPINION OF THE SUN THOUGH ON ALL OF THIS THERE WILL START OUR PAPER REVIEW WITH THE SUN'S EDITORIAL CRITICISING YESTERDAY'S DECISION TO UPHOLD THAT CELEBRITY GAGGING ORDER DESCRIBING THE SUPREME COURT RULING AS A LOGICAL IN IDIOTIC THE SUN SAYS IT DISMISSES THE JUDGES AS OUT OF TOUCH OLD DUFFERS
HAVE A PREDICTABLY CONTEMPTUOUS SNOBBERY TOWARDS POPULAR PAPERS IT GOES ON TO SUGGEST MOST PEOPLE WHO CARE ALREADY KNOW THE NAME OF THE CELEBRITY INVOLVED IT ARGUES IS PALPABLY ABSURD TO KEEP READERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES FROM THING INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO HIM BILLIONS ON LINE THE PRIVACY CAMPAIGNER AND FORMER MOTOR RACING EXECUTIVE MAX MOSLEY TELLS THE GUARD IN THE SUPREME COURT WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WRITING IN THE PAPER HE DISMISSES THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF PUBLICATION IS HOLLOW CLAIM IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE ANYTHING MORE TRIVIAL THAN A PRIVATE THREESOME INVOLVING A CELEBRITY
THE RULE OF LAW HE SAYS HE'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RULE OF TABLOID EDITORS WHO SHOULD BE MADE TO REFLECT ON WHAT SOCIETY WOULD BE LIKE IF WE ALL DID AS WE PLEASED AND THE COURTS NO LONGER HAD AUTHORITY NUMBER OF THEORIES AS TO WHY AN EGYPTIAN PASSENGER JET DISAPPEARED OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN YESTERDAY OR ADVANCED BY THE PAPERS ALL AGREEING THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY TERRORISM BLOWN OUT OF THE SKY AS THE HEADLINE IN THE MIRROR THE MAIL REPORTS THAT INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGESTED AN EXPLOSION ON BOARD
TELEGRAPH NOTES THAT THE MODEL OF PLANE THE AIRBUS A. THREE TWENTY IS AN EXCELLENT SAFETY RECORD LEAVING A TERRORIST ATTACK AS THE MOST LIKELY POSSIBILITY ESPECIALLY AS NO DISTRESSING OUR SCENT THERE'S WIDESPREAD CRITICISM OF MUIRFIELD GOLF CLUB AFTER IT VOTED AGAINST ADMITTING WOMEN MEMBERS FOR THE TIMES THE PIG HEADEDNESS OF THE DECISION WAS ALL THE MORE STAGGERING IS IT LED TO THE INEVITABLE REMOVAL OF THE COURSE
FROM THE ROTA OF OPEN VENUES THE EDITORIAL IN THE MIRROR AGREES ARGUING THAT WHEN AN ORGANISATION CALLED THE ROYAL AND ANCIENT DECIDE YOU'RE OUT OF DATE IT'S CLAIRE YOU'RE REALLY NOT UP TO PAR BUT THE TELEGRAPH REPORTS FOR THE B.B.C. GOLF COMMENTATOR PETER ELLIS HAS DEFENDED THE BAN INSISTING THE WOMEN WOULD NEVER WANT TO PAY THE FEES ANYWAY COMMENTS BY THE SHADOW MINISTER FOR EUROPE PAT GLASS IN WHICH SHE DESCRIBED A VOTER AS A HORRIBLE RACIST OR WIDELY REPORTED THE MAIL SAYS THE GAFF LED TO COMPARISONS
PREVIOUS CONFERENCES INVOLVING GORDON BROWN AND EMILY THORNBERRY THE TIME SENSE THE EPISODE WHAT ANGER THOSE IN THE LABOUR PARTY BELIEVE THE DECISION TO SUPPORT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN LEAVES THEM DISTANT FROM THEIR CORE VOTERS THE EXPRESS'S OUTRAGED ARGUING IN ITS EDITORIAL AT THE CANDID REMARKS ARE INDICATIVE OF THE SNOBBISH METROPOLITAN MINDSET THAT CHARACTERISES THE MODERN LABOUR PARTY HEY WRISTBAND WHICH INFLICTS AND ELECTRICS
SHOCK ON THE WEARER IF THEIR BANK ACCOUNT GOES OVERDRAWN IS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE GUARDIAN AND THE MALE THE THEY AUDIENCES THE INVENTION BY A BRITISH COMPANY HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN USED TO HELP PEOPLE BREAK BAD HABITS SUCH AS SMOKING NAILBITING AN UNHEALTHY EATING THE MAIL SAYS THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE ALL SHOCK IS SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND SUGGEST IT COULD BE THE PERFECT WAY OF KEEPING TABS ON THE SPENDING HABITS OF A WIFE
WHILST THE TIME TWENTY TO EIGHT THIRTY YEARS AGO THIS WEEK TOP GUN WAS RELEASED SALES OF BOMBER JACKETS AND RAY BANS WENT THROUGH THE ROOF AND TOM CRUISE'S NAME WAS MADE THE CRITICS SAID THE DIALOGUE WAS WOODEN AND FOOLISH
THEY LOVE THE AERIAL SHOTS AND THEY LOVED THE WORLD LOVED THE SOUNDTRACK THE ALBUM SPENT FIVE WEEKS AT NUMBER ONE IN THE CHARTS THAT YEAR WENT ON TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SELLING FILM SOUNDTRACKS OF ALL TIME I BEEN REMINISCING WITH THE MAN WHO WROTE THE TOP GUN ANTHEM IS THE GERMAN COMPOSER HAROLD FALTER MATT HE TOLD ME HOW THE SOUND OF THE MOVIE WAS SO CRUCIAL TO PRODUCER JERRY BRUCKHEIMER THAT HE SENT HIM THE SCRIPT BEFORE FILMING BEGAN
TOP GUN IS A VERY AMERICAN TOPIC UP OBVIOUSLY IN AND THEN WILL BE DID GOOD AND THE SECRET WAS THAT AND WAS PROGRAMMERS FOR US APPROACH TO TELL ME WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE IS ROCK'N'ROLL IN THE SKY AND YOU HAVE TO JUST SEE DISGUISED AS PILOTS WHEN THEY'RE WAITING FOR THE TAKE OFF ASSIGNMENT THEY THEY HAVE THE CANOPY OPEN AND THEY HAVE A WALKMAN UNDER LISTEN TO BILLY IDOL
THIS WAS THE FIRST BRIEFING OH GUARD SO I KNEW WHAT TO DO THAN L.A. HEAR IT IT'S A BLESSED TO HAVE TO HAVE THIS AND FOR THE GREAT GUITAR PERFORMANCE OF STEVE'S
WHAT ONE THINGS YOU HAD TO DO WAS WAS COMPLETE IN A WAY DIDN'T YOU WITH WITH JET ENGINES WRECKED THIS WAS THE BIG BIG TASK BECAUSE THE CHIP ENGINE NOISE IS LIKE A WHITE NOISE YOU KNOW IMPLIED NOISES IS MORALIST AS SOME OF ALL MUSICAL INFORMATION
THE SOLUTION WAS NOT PUT A LOT OF PADDING ON BUT WOULD VERY ACCENTUATED THOSE GAPS AND THINGS
YOU REALLY REALLY HAD ROOM FOR IT WHEN YOU LISTEN JUST HAVE THIS CORE INPUT IT CHEQUE MAI'S AWAY YOU HEATHER VERY ARTS CORPS IN SOME PLACES BECAUSE WE TRIED TO IT REALLY
GET THROUGH THE WAY
WATCH THE BIRDIE THERE GREG
AT THAT TIME THE SUN TO ACCEPT WERE SELLING REALLY REALLY GOOD
THE STUDIO WAS AFTER HER THE BIG IN THE VERY VERY STRONG SO A SOUNDTRACK BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT THEY'RE GONNA SELL MILLIONS AND OF COURSE BEVERLY HILLS COP AS WELL YOU DID AND AGAIN WAS A HUGE SUCCESS FOR YOU ARE YET BEVERLEY HAS COUPLES ACTUALLY MY FIRST REALLY REALLY BIG STEP INTO THE MOVIE MARKET ANTH DID IT LIVE THROUGH GENERATIONS ARE REALLY ENDED SO IT'S GREAT TO HAVE MUSICAL BUSINESS CARD LIKE THAT
DID THE BEVERLY HILLS COP THEME OR DID THE WAY IT WAS TREATED DID DID DID THAT CHANGE THE WAY THINGS WERE DONE
OH YEAH DEFINITELY WE WERE LOOKING VERY VERY LONG FOR FOUR THAT THEME IN THOUGH I TURNED IN A COUPLE OF DEMOS AND DIFFERENT STYLES OF MUSIC DON'T YOU THINK WE KNEW WAS WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A CORE WHICH IS SOMETHING LIKE LIKE THEN GALLEYS OR SOMETHING HE LEDUC LEG TANGERINE DREAM THOSE WE WANTED TO HAVE A CHAMPI THE VERY YOUNG AND VERY SPAS KIND OF SCORE
WHICH THE STUDIO IN THE FIRST PLACE DIDN'T LIKE BECAUSE THEY WERE USED TO BEFORE AN ORCHESTRA YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO AND YOU DO A BIT OF A BIG COMEDY LIKE THIS YOU KNOW TO DO IT WITH A COUPLE OF SYNTHESISERS WAS WAS SOMETHING YOU HAD TO REALLY CONVINCE A LOT OF PEOPLE
PORTON WAS THIS THE SYNTHESISER TO ALL OF THIS COS YOU THINK BACK TO THE EIGHTIES AND YOU THINK
ABOUT THE SOUNDTRACKS BUT YOU ALSO THINK ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH MUSIC WAS MADE AND IN A SENSE IT WAS THE GOLDEN AGE WASN'T IT AS THE SYNTHESISER I'LL DEFINITELY SO MANY NEW SYNTHESISERS CAME ON THE MARKET THEN YOU KNOW AND IT WAS LIKE A ON A DAILY BASIS WE GO NEW STUFF FROM ROLAND FROM SONY FROM YOUR MUM FROM QUARREL GO WHEREVER AND IT WAS A BLAST TO SEE HOW THEY DEVELOP AND HOW THEY'D TREATED THE MUSICIANS YOU KNOW
THEN OF COURSE AS A MUSICIAN YOU HAD TO GIVE FEEDBACK TO THE MANUFACTURERS SO IT WAS LIKE A BALL BACK AND FORTH KIND OF PLAY WHICH WHICH WAS GREAT BECAUSE THIS LEAD EVEN TO A MORE FURIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF SYNTHESIZERS
OUR FATHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THANK YOU BUT I HAVE A MOSTLY BUT GO ON
UP TOP GUN PRODUCED BY SIMPSON AND BRUCKHEIMER AND DISTRIBUTED BY PARAMOUNT PICTURES THE TIME IS A QUARTER TO EIGHT LET'S STAND A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY BECAUSE THE SPEAKER AND I'M NORWICH STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE RIGHT REVEREND GRAHAM JAMES IS THE BISHOP OF NORWICH MORNING GOOD MORNING THOUGH THERE ISN'T MUCH THAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT FOR THE FAMILIES AND FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO DIED ON EGYPT AIR FLIGHT M.S. EIGHT OH FOUR AS A MASSIVE SEARCH IS UNDERWAY FOR THE MISSING PLANE WHATEVER THE CAUSE TURNS OUT TO BE THEIR GRIEF AND BEREAVEMENT WILL NOT BE MODERATED
THERE ARE MANY TRAGIC STORIES EMERGING FROM THE BRITISH FATHER WHO LEAVES A WIFE AND TWO SMALL CHILDREN TO THAT OF A YOUNG MAN FROM LIVING IN FRANCE WHOSE MOTHER HAD JUST DIED HE WAS ON HIS WAY HOME TO GRIEVE WITH HIS RELATIVES IN THOMAS HARDY'S NOVEL THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE ONE OF THE CHARACTERS SAYS THE FATES ARE AGAINST YOU THAT'S HOW IT MUST SEEM FOR THAT FAMILY
ALTHOUGH THE BEREAVED NO THAT LEARNING THE CAUSE AND THE DETAILS OF THE PLANE'S LAST MOMENTS WERE NOT ASSUAGE THEIR GRIEF THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LOVE ISN'T A GENERALISED FEELING WE LOVE PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR AND IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR LIVES EVEN IN THEN THROUGH THE MOMENTS OF THEIR DYING
ARE MANY FUNERAL VISITS I'VE LISTENED TO SPOUSES AND PARTNERS OFFER ME A MINUTE BY MINUTE ACCOUNT OF HOW THEIR LOVED ONE DIED BY DESCRIBING IT THEY'RE NOT DENYING DEATHS REALITY BUT OFTEN THANKFUL THAT THE PERSON THEY LOVED DID NOT DIE ALONE SOMETIMES WE SAY WE'D LIKE TO GO QUICKLY BUT MOST RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS ASK FOR DELIVERANCE FROM SUDDEN DEATH IT'S INCLUDED AS A SPECIFIC PETITION IN THE LITANY IN THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER
IT WAS AS A YOUNG PRIEST MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO THAT I CAME TO KNOW PHILIP TOYNBEE FOR MANY YEARS THE DOYENNE OF LITERARY REVIEWERS HE MOVED TO THE WELSH COUNTRYSIDE AND FOUND HIMSELF A NEAR NEIGHBOUR OF AN ANGLICAN CONTEMPLATIVE COMMUNITY OF NUNS THE SOCIETY OF THE SACRED CROSS
IT WAS AN UNLIKELY MATCH BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO'D BEEN FAIRLY BOHEMIAN AND SISTERS FOLLOWING THE RELIGIOUS LIFE BUT THEY BECAME VERY CLOSE
WHEN PHILIP WAS DYING OF CANCER I RECALL HIM DOUBTING WHETHER TO HAVE A FINAL OPERATION IT WAS A RISK HE DIDN'T WANT TO DIE ON THE OPERATING TABLE HE SAID THAT WOULD DEPRIVE ME OF THE PROPER STAGES OF DARLING AND I WANT TO LEARN ALL I CAN FROM IT
RARE IS THE PERSON WHO APPROACHES THEIR DEATH LIKE THAT BUT THE DEPRIVATION OF SUDDEN DEATH AND THE INFLICTION OF SUDDEN GRIEF ARE BOTH GREATER THAN WE MAY IMAGINE
PERHAPS TODAY AS WE REMEMBER THE VICTIMS AND FAMILIES OF THE EGYPT AIR DISASTER WE MAY CAST A NET OF SYMPATHY MUCH WIDER TO INCLUDE ALL VISITED BY SUDDEN DEATH OR SUDDEN GRIEF
THAT WAS A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE RIGHT REVEREND GRAHAM JAMES THE BISHOP OF NORWICH THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND IS HEADING FOR A RECORD DEFICIT IF HE GOES TO THE TREASURY WILL FACE A FORMAL REQUEST FOR AN EMERGENCY INJECTION OF CASH THE LAST TIME THINGS WITH THIS SERIOUS WAS A DECADE AGO AND SOON AFTER THAT THE HEAD OF THE N.H.S.
WAS FORCED TO RESIGN NO WONDER THEN THAT THIS HUGE PRESSURE ON MANAGES INSIDE THE HEALTH SERVICE TO MASSAGE THE END OF YEAR FIGURES TO MAKE THEM LOOK AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE OR PERHAPS THAT SHOULD BE NOT AS DIRE AS THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE BE OR HEALTH EDITOR HUGH PYM HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO ONE N.H.S. MANAGER ABOUT WHAT'S BEING EXPECTED OF HIM AND HE JOINS ME IN THE STUDIO NOW YOU HOW WORRIED IS THE PERSON YOU'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO
WELL NICK VERY WORRIED THIS IS A HOSPITAL TRUST FINANCE DIRECTOR AND WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THAT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES ARE BEING USED TO TRY TO GET THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S BOOKS TO BUDGET FOR THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR WHICH ENDED IN MARCH TODAY WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH THE TRUST SECTOR THE HOSPITAL TRUSTS AMBULANCE TRUST AND SO ON WERE IN DEFICIT POSSIBLY UP TO THREE BILLION POUNDS
THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO SORT OF BALANCE THAT FROM OTHER BITS OF THE N.H.S. TO TRY TO MAKE THE BOOKS COME IN WITH WHAT WAS VOTED ON BY PARLIAMENT IN TERMS OF THEIR BUDGET SO THE FIRST THING THIS TRUST DIRECTOR SAYS HE WANTS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SHIFTS FROM CAPITAL SPENDING INVESTMENT SPENDING INTO DAY TO DAY RUNNING COSTS AND A LOT OF ATTENTION FROM THE CENTRE TO WHAT'S GOING ON INDIVIDUAL TRUSTS NOW THESE ARE HIS WORDS BUT NOT HIS VOICE
THE D.H. IS KICKING UP ACCOUNTING ALCHEMY TURNING HOSPITALS VERY LARGE AGGREGATED DEFICITS INTO A MUCH LOWER FIGURE TO ENSURE THE N.H.S. MEETS THE SPENDING LIMIT SET BY H.M. TREASURY THE SO CALLED CAPITALS OR REVENUE TRANSFER MAY WELL BE A LEGITIMATE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT AT THE MARGINS OF THE N.H.S. ACCOUNTS BUT I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS IT IS BEING USED IN THE SCALE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS IN MORE THAN EIGHTY TRUSTS THE CASH IS BEING WASHED THROUGH THE HOSPITAL'S ACCOUNTS AS INCOME MERELY TO IMPROVE THEIR BOTTOM LINE
NOW THE SECOND POINT HE MAKES IS THAT CONSULTANCY FIRMS HAVE BEEN SENT IN TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TRUSTS TO LOOK AT THEIR PREPARATION OF THEIR ANNUAL ACCOUNTS AND TO SEE WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN TO PRUDENT OR TOO CAUTIOUS ABOUT SOME OF THEIR ASSUMPTIONS THEN HE ALLEGES THAT THESE CONSULTANCY REFORMS ARE REPORTING BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO SAY ACTUALLY YOU COULD MAYBE ADD ALL THIS UP AND BUILD IN ANOTHER COUPLE OF HUNDRED MILLION TO TRY TO BALANCE THE BOOKS AND THIS IS WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT
SENDING AN EXPENSIVE ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS THAT YEAR END TO REVIEW TRANSACTIONS AND COMMENT ON THEIR JUDGEMENT'S BEEN MADE BY TWENTY FINANCE DIRECTORS AND THEIR BOARDS IN THEIR OWN ACCOUNTS IS UNPRECEDENTED IN MY THIRTY YEAR FINANCE CAREER I AM DEEPLY WORRIED THAT THE FINDINGS OF THE TWENTY SITE VISIT IS LIKELY TO BE USED TO ALTER THE N.H.S. ACCOUNTS ACCOUNTANTS HAVE A PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATION TO ACT WITH INTEGRITY AND TO BE OBJECTIVE
I BELIEVED AT THE PRESSURE ON THE D.A. TO METIS BUDGET MEANS THAT OFFICIALS HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO TAKE UNORTHODOX MEASURES TO MASK THE UNDERLYING SIZE OF THE N.H.S. IS DAY TO DAY BUDGET DEFICIT UNORTHODOX MEASURES HUGH WHY WOULD HOSPITAL TRUST FEEL SO MUCH PRESSURE WHY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH FEEL SO MUCH PRESSURE TO WALTER THE NUMBERS IN THIS WAY RATHER THAN SIMPLY SAYING THAT WE DID OUR BEST BUT WE NEED SOME MORE MONEY
IF YOU'VE HAD A BUDGET VOTED ON BY PARLIAMENT AND THEN YOU GO FURTHER THAN THAT WITHOUT GOING BACK TO PARLIAMENT THAT IS A PRETTY SERIOUS OFFENCE IN WHITEHALL TERMS AND ONE SEES A COUNCIL FINALLY DRAWN UP AND GIVEN TO THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE THEY MAY SAY NO WE DON'T ACCEPT A LOT OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS THAT'S A SORT OF RED CARD OFFENCE IN WHITEHALL TERMS I SHOULD JUST SAY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IS SAYING ACTUALLY THE TRANSFERS FROM CAPITAL TO REVENUE MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE OVERALL DEPARTMENTAL PICTURE GIVEN
PARLIAMENT HAS ALREADY VOTED TO APPROVE IT TO SAY OTHERWISE IS MISLEADING BUT IT HAS INVESTED TEN BILLION MORE OVER FIVE YEARS BY TWENTY TWENTY TO HELP THE N.H.S. MOST PEOPLE WON'T CARE ABOUT INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS HE MEASURES THEY CARE ABOUT THE STATE OF THE HEALTH OF OUR HEALTH SERVICE CHRIS HOBSON JOINT IS AS WELL NOW CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF N.H.S. PROVIDERS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VERY N.H.S. TRUSTS
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S JUST BEGIN WITH THE ACCOUNTANCY FIRST THOUGH IF WE COULD SHOULD PEOPLE THINK WELL HOLD ON SOMETHING A BIT FISHY HERE YOU'VE MONEY FOR INVESTMENT IS BEING SPENT ON DAY TO DAY SPENDING AND IF TEAMS OF ACCOUNTANTS ARE GOING IN AND SAY WHY DON'T YOU SQUEEZE THAT BUDGET HEADING TO MAKE IT LOOK A BIT BETTER SO NICK I'VE SAT ON HER FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED SUBSIDIARY BOARD I'VE SAT ON A GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT BORED I'VE SAT ON A NATIONAL CHARITY BOARD AND THIS IS THE KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT YOU HAVE AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THE FIGURES ARE REALLY REALLY TIGHT
COUNTING IN THAT SENSE FOR ME IS NOT A SCIENCE IT'S AN ART A NEW EFFECTIVELY SAY IF MONEY IS REALLY REALLY TIGHT WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE WAY OF FOR EXAMPLE TREATING CAPITAL SPAIN WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE WAY OF HOW YOU MIGHT LOOK AT WHAT PROVISIONS YOU MADE IN YOUR ACCOUNTS AND SO BASICALLY IT'S A PERFECTLY ORDINARY THING TO DO BUT THEY DO THEY DON'T BIT THERE ARE MEMBERS SAYING TO YOU BECAUSE YOU REPRESENT ALL THESE TRUSTS WE SHARE SOME OF THOSE WORRIES ABOUT
UNORTHODOX MEASURES WE'RE NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO DO YEAH AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE PRESSURE THIS YEAR IS MUCH GREATER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN AND THAT THEREFORE EACH INDIVIDUAL FINANCE DIRECTOR AND EACH INDIVIDUAL BOARD IS HAVING TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS APPROPRIATE AND THAT'S AS AS IT SHOULD BE IT'S UP TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ULTIMATELY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING
AND IS ANYONE SAYING TO YOU WE THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE WE WOULD WE SHOULDN'T THEY DO THAT THERE IS A RANGE OF OPINION AND THERE ARE CLEARLY AT THE MOST EXTREME END AT ONE END THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING THIS IS GETTING VERY VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE ENVELOPE AND I'VE NOT HAD ANYBODY WHO'S EDWIN APPROPRIATE YET WHAT I'VE HAD NOT HAD ANYBODY SAY THAT WHAT THEY FEEL IS HAPPENING IS EITHER IS ILLEGAL
OR HE'S PUTTING THEM IN A POSITION WHERE THEY EFFECTIVELY FEEL THEY ARE BEING PRESSURED TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BREACH THEIR FORMAL FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF COURSE IS A SYMPTOM OF A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT IT'S IS ARE WE ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET AN N.H.S. ON THE CHEAP AND WE CAN'T AFFORD IT
WELL AND THAT THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS IS A CLASSIC SYMPTOM OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT SKY ROCKETING DEMAND I WAS IN NORWICH IN NORFOLK HOSPITAL ON WEDNESDAY AND OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THEY'VE SEEN EMERGENCY CASES RISE BY THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OUTPATIENTS RISE BY THIRTY NINE PERCENT AND THE NUMBER OF AMBULANCES ARRIVING AT A ANY RISING BY SIXTY NINE PERCENT SO DEMAND SKYROCKETING BUT WE'RE NOW IN THIS TEN YEAR PERIOD WHERE N.H.S. FUNDING IS ONLY INCREASING BY LESS THAN ONE PER CENT WHERE
ACTUALLY COST AND DEMAND IS INCREASING BY THREE AND A HALF HOLD ON MINISTERS WOULD SAY IT IS INCREASING LOTS OF OTHER BUDGETS ARE NOT INCREASE NO ABSOLUTELY AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROTECTED THE N.H.S. BUDGET BUT NICK THE REALLY IMPORTANT POINT IS AS A NATION WE ARE SPENDING WEIGHED LESS THAN OF THE O.E.C.D. AVERAGE SO EVEN THERE
CASH STRAPPED GREEKS GREEKS ARE SPENDING NINE PER CENT OF THEIR NATIONAL WEALTH ON HEALTH THE FRENCH THE GERMANS AND THE DUTCH ARE SPENDING ELEVEN PERCENT WHERE'S WE'RE SPENDING LESS THERE MATE AND IT'S DUE TO DROP TO A FIGURE BEGINNING WITH THE SEVEN AND THAT I HAVE TO SAY IS A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR US AS A NATION SO HIS HOUSE DEMANDS RISES HOW MUCH DO WE WANT TO SPEND ON HEALTH AND CARE BUT IN A SENSE WE THOUGHT THIS HAD BEEN SETTLED THE HEAD OF THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND DEMANDED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY PROMISED THAT HE WOULD MAKE BIG EFFICIENCIES WAS
GRANTED THAT MONEY ARE YOU SAYING THAT A YEAR INTO THAT PROCESS ACTUALLY THAT ISN'T ENOUGH THE EFFICIENCIES CAN'T BE DELIVERED ON THE SCALE AND THE NATION NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO SPEND A LOT MORE WELL NICK I PREFER TO PUT IT INTO A MUCH BROADER CONTEXT THIS IS A TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEAR ISSUE HOW MUCH OF OUR NATIONAL WEALTH DO WE WANT TO SPEND ON HEALTH AND CARE
AS WE GET OLDER POPULATION AND THE ANSWER IS WE'RE GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY GOING SON TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE CURRENT QUALITY OF CARE THAT WE PROVIDE ON OUR G.D.P. OF LESS THAN A FOR THE COLOUR SEVEN PER CENT THERE WERE EXPECTING BY TWENTY TWENTY IT WE REALLY DO NEED A DEBATE HERE AS A NATION ABOUT HOW MUCH WE WANNA SPEND AND BRIEFLY IF NOT
WHAT DON'T WE GET THAT WE EXPECT TO GET WHAT YOU GET AS AS AS AS AS YOU SAW IN NORFOLK AND NORWICH WHERE EFFECT OF THE TRYING TO SEE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PATIENTS IN AN A. AND E. DEPARTMENT WHICH IS RATED AS OUTSTANDING ONE OF THE VERY FEW IN A DEPARTMENT THAT WAS BUILT JUST FOURTEEN YEARS AGO FOR SIXTY THOUSAND SO YOU'VE GOT STAFF TRYING TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE SO THIS ACCOUNTANCY ARGUMENT IN WAYS LIKE A CANARY IN THE MIND I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD DESCRIPTION
CHRIS HOBSON OF N.H.S. PROVIDED HUGH PAY MY HEALTH EDITOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT DARREN'S HERE WITH WEATHER

GOOD MORNING IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE TWENTIETH OF MAY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING EGYPT'S PRESIDENT AS ORDERED OFFICIALS TO INTENSIFY THE HUGE SEARCH FOR WRECKAGE OF AN AIRLINER WHICH DISAPPEARED OVER THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN AND WHISTLE HE'S ACCUSED THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAVE COOKING UP ACCOUNTING ALCHEMY TO HIDE THE TRUE SIZE OF THE N.H.S. ENGLAND'S DEFICIT
ALMOST ONE HUNDRED WOMEN AND GIRLS SEIZED BY BOKO HARAM HAVE BEEN RESCUED BY THE NIGERIAN ARMY AND COUNCILLORS IN NORTH YORKSHIRE MEET TODAY TO DISCUSS WHETHER TO APPROVE A CONTROVERSIAL FRACKING SCHEME THE NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY CATHY CLAXTON A HUGE INTERNATIONAL SEARCH IS TAKING PLACE FOR THE MISSING EGYPT AIRPLANE WHICH DISAPPEARED OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGO
INITIAL REPORTS THAT WRECKAGE HAD BEEN FINED HAVE PROVED UNTRUE SIXTY SIX PEOPLE WERE ON BOARD FLIGHT M.S. OH FOUR FROM PARIS TO CAIRO EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH WAS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN A TERRORIST ATTACK
BUT A SHORT TIME AGO THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN MARC A HOLE SO THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION OF WHAT CAUSED THE PLANE TO COME DOWN AND ALL POSSIBILITIES WERE BEING LOOKED AT
THE FAMILIES OF THE FRENCH PASSENGERS ON BOARD HAVE BEGUN ARRIVING IN CAIRO FROM WHERE KEVIN CONNELLY REPORTS
GRIEVING FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE LOST PASSENGERS HAVE COME FROM FRANCE FROM KUWAIT AND FROM FAR FLUNG DESERT TOWNS AND VILLAGES IN EGYPT THEIR ARRIVAL WILL INTENSIFY PRESSURE ON THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS RESPONSE TO THIS LATEST AVIATION DISASTER IS BOTH COMPETENT AND COMPASSION
THE RETRACTION OF THE CLAIM THAT WRECKAGE FROM THE PLANE HAD ALREADY BEEN FOUND IS SOMETHING OF AN EMBARRASSMENT ONE OFFICIAL SAID SIMPLY WE GOT IT WRONG
THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT OUT THEM BUTTER C.C. HAS RESPONDED BY ORDERING AN INTENSIFICATION OF THE RECOVERY OPERATION
BRITAIN IS AMONG THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN WHAT IS NOW AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT WITH A SHIP OF THE ROYAL FLEET AUXILIARY DISPATCHED TO THE SEARCH AREA AT A HERCULES AIRCRAFT ALSO DEPLOYED
AS THE AIR AND SEA OPERATIONS CONTINUE SOME BEREAVED EGYPTIAN FAMILIES ARE PLANNING FOR FUNERAL SERVICES TODAY AFTER FRIDAY PRAYERS SUCH SERVICES CONDUCTED AROUND EMPTY COFFINS ARE A FOCUS FOR GRIEF
USUALLY CARRIED OUT WHEN THE PROSPECTS OF FINDING THE BODIES OF THE DEAD ARE JUDGED TO BE SMALL
GRAHAM BRAITHWAITE IS PROFESSOR OF SAFETY AND ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION AT CRANFIELD UNIVERSITY HE TOLD US THE SEARCH FOR THE PLANE COULD TAKE SOME TIME AND COVER A LARGE AREA
CERTAINLY IS THE LAST POSITION WAS AT HEIGHT AND EST AIRCRAFT WAS NOT GOING IN A STRAIGHT LINE THEN OBVIOUSLY IT COULD BE QUITE A WIDE SEARCH AREA
ALSO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR DEBRIS ON THE SEA SURFACE THEN DOES SAY WILL WILL HAVE MOVED AS WELL SO YOU TEND TO SEARCH IN A GRID PATTERN AND TRY AND NARROW DOWN THE SEARCH AREA USING AIRCRAFT TO DO THAT AND THAT THAT OFTEN TAKES A WHILE TO GET ASSEMBLED AND GET STARTED
AN N.H.S. WHISTLEBLOWER HAS ACCUSED THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAVE USING ACCOUNTING ALCHEMY TO TRY TO STAY WITHIN GOVERNMENT SPENDING LIMITS FIGURES TODAY ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW A TOTAL DEFICIT AMONG HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH TRUSTS IN ENGLAND OF MORE THAN TWO BILLION POUNDS FOR THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR BETWEEN TWO AND THREE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL BUDGET
OUR HEALTH EDITOR HUGH PYM REPORTS THERE'S BEEN A SHOP DOWNTURN IN THE FINANCES OF ENGLISH HEALTH TRUSTS PARTLY BECAUSE OF HIGHER BILLS FOR AGENCY STAFF NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS TO FIND SURPLUSES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE N.H.S. TO SET AGAINST TRUST DEFICITS AS IT PREPARES OCCURRENCE FOR THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR THERE'S SPECULATION IT WILL STRUGGLE TO KEEP WITHIN THE SPENDING LIMIT AGREED BY PARLIAMENT
A HOSPITAL TRUST FINANCE DIRECTOR WHO WISHES TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS TOLD THE B. B. C. THE DEPARTMENT WAS COOKING UP ACCOUNTING ALCHEMY WITH EXAMPLES INCLUDING SHIFTING INVESTMENT SPENDING INTO DAY TO DAY RUNNING COSTS HE CLAIM TO THAT WITH CONSULTANT SENT TO LOOK AT THE BOOKS OF SOME TRUSTS UNORTHODOX MEASURES WERE BEING USED TO MASK THE SIZE OF THE N.H.S. DEFICIT
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SPOKESMAN SAID THE POLICY IS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO WHAT WAS APPROVED BY PARLIAMENT BUT IT WAS MISLEADING TO SAY OTHERWISE AND HELP WAS BEING GIVEN TO REDUCE THE USE OF EXPENSIVE AGENCY STAFF
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF N.H.S. PROVIDERS WHICH REPRESENTS N.H.S. TRUSTS CHRIS HOBSON TOLD US THE N.H.S. WAS UNDER GREAT FINANCIAL PRESSURE AND ORGANISATIONS ALWAYS TRIED TO MAKE THE BEST OF THEIR ACCOUNTS AT THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR BUT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING IMPROPER WAS HAPPENING
I'VE HAD NOT HAD ANYBODY SAY THAT WHAT THEY FEEL IS HAPPENING IS EITHER IS ILLEGAL OR HE'S PUTTING THEM IN A POSITION WHERE THEY EFFECTIVELY FEEL THEY ARE BEING PRESSURED TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BREACH THEIR FORMAL FIDUCIARY DUTIES
TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO LEADING FIGURES IN THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES HAVE SIGNED A LETTER SAYING BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. BOLSTERS ITS ROLE ON THE WORLD STAGE THE SIGNATORIES WHO WORK IN FILM MUSIC THEATRE DANCE THE ARTS AND FASHION SO LEAVING WOULD TURN THE COUNTRY INTO AN OUTSIDER SHOUTING FROM THE WINGS
THOSE WHO HAVE SIGNED INCLUDE BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH DIM VIVIAN WESTWOOD NICHOLAS HYTNER AND RICHARD RODGERS THE LETTER HAS BEEN DISMISSED BY VOTE LEAVE SUPPORTERS ONE SAID THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES WERE BOOMING BECAUSE OF THE TALENT AND BRITAIN'S D.N.A. AND NOT BECAUSE OF THE E.U.
THE NIGERIAN MILITARY SAYS IT'S RESCUED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED WOMEN AND GIRLS WHO ARE BEING HELD BY BOKO HARAM MILITANT IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY AND ARMY SPOKESMAN SAID ONE OF THE SCHOOLGIRLS KIDNAPPED FROM THE TIME OF CHI BOG TWO YEARS AGO WAS FREED AND THE OPERATION TOMMY ON A DIPOLE REPORTS FROM THE NIGERIAN CAPITAL ABUJA
JUST AS THE RESCUE OF THE FIRST GOAL WAS BEING CELEBRATED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ANNOUNCE THEIR TROOPS HAD FOUND ANOTHER OF THE CHIP BOX SCHOOLGIRLS AS THEY'RE KNOWN THE ARMY SPOKESMAN SAYS NINETY SEVEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ALSO RESCUED FROM BULGAR OUR MILITANTS IN THE OPERATION ON THURSDAY
FOR MONTHS THE NIGERIAN MILITARY HAS BEEN RESCUING LARGE GROUPS OF CAPTIVES BUT THE CHIP UP GIRLS ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST CLOSELY GUARDED BY THE JIHAD HE'S SO THE ARMY WILL SEE THIS AS A MAJOR SUCCESS AS IT CONTINUES ITS FIGHT AGAINST BOKO HARAM BUT ACTIVISTS HAVE ALSO CRITICISED THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS HANDLING OF THE SITUATION AND SEEING THE FIRST GOAL SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE LIMELIGHT SO SOON AFTER HER ORDEAL
ISRAEL'S DEFENCE MINISTER MARCIA YEAH A LON HAS RESIGNED AMID REPORTS THE PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS OFFERED HIS POST TO THE RIGHT WING POLITICIAN AVIGDOR LIEBERMAN AS PART OF HER ATTEMPTS TO EXPAND HIS GOVERNING COALITION MY LON SAID ON TWITTER OR THAT HE HAD LOST FAITH IN THEIR PRIME MINISTER AND WAS TAKING A BREAK FROM POLITICAL LIFE

AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HIM WHEN IT WAS DISCLOSED THAT SEVERAL OFFICERS HAD EXCHANGED RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC TEXT MESSAGES BUT THE SHOOTING OF A TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO'D CRASHED A STOLEN CAR INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE MADE THE POLICE CHIEF'S POSITION UNTENABLE MISTER LEVY SAID CHANGES TO THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT WERE CLEARLY NOT HAPPENING FAST ENOUGH
THE TRADE BODY WHICH REPRESENTS THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IN THE U.K. THE B.P.I. SAYS BRITISH ARTISTS ACCOUNTED FOR ONE IN EVERY SIX ALBUMS SOLD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD LAST YEAR BUT IT SAYS REVENUES ARE FALLING BECAUSE ARTISTS AND LESS FROM VIDEO STREAMING SERVICES SUCH AS YOUTUBE THAN THEY DO FROM SALES OF VINYL ALBUMS RORY CATON JONES HAS THE STORY
IT'S ME ADELE HELP ON TWENTY FIVE WAS THE STAND OUT HIT IN A VERY GOOD YEAR FOR THE BRITISH MUSIC INDUSTRY BUT WHILE MORE MUSIC IS BEING CONSUMED IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS SALES REVENUES ACTUALLY FELL SLIGHTLY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A BIG RISE IN THE USE OF MUSIC STREAMING SERVICE IS LIKE SPOTIFY WITH INCOME FROM THESE UP SEVENTY PER CENT
VIDEO STREAMING OF MUSIC MAINLY ON YOUTUBE ALSO ROSE SHARPLY BUT THAT ONLY GENERATED A NOUGHT POINT FOUR PERCENT RISE IN REVENUE TO TWENTY FOUR MILLION POUNDS LESS THAN THE INDUSTRY MADE FROM FINAL SALES A TRADE BODY THE B.P.I. SAYS MUSIC IS HELPING TO GROW YOUTUBE'S BUSINESS BUT ARTISTS AREN'T BENEFITING BUT YOUTUBE SAYS IT'S PAID MORE THAN TWO BILLION POUNDS IN TOTAL TO THE GLOBAL MUSIC INDUSTRY AND HELPS ARTISTS REACH A HUGE AUDIENCE
KEVIN JONES REPORTING THE TIME TEN PAST EIGHT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE EGYPT AIRPLANE TO CRASH INTO THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE EARLY HOURS OF YESTERDAY MORNING WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THOSE WHO DIED THEN INCLUDING TWO BABIES AND A YOUNG CHILD AS WELL AS A FORTY YEAR OLD BRITISH MAN RICHARD OSMAN WHO JUST BECOME A FATHER FOR THE SECOND TIME THE SUSPICION OF COURSE IS THAT THEY WERE DELIBERATELY KILLED BY TERRORISTS WHO SMUGGLED A BOMB ON BOARD OR PERHAPS GOT INTO THE COCKPIT DURING THE FLIGHT
THE PLANE HAD TAKEN OFF FROM PARIS LAST YEAR A REVIEW WAS CARRIED OUT INTO THIS CASE SECURITY PASSES OF THOUSANDS OF STAFF AT CHILD DAGO AIRPORT FIFTY SEVEN WORKERS WITH ACCESS TO RUNWAYS AND AIRCRAFT WERE ON AN INTELLIGENCE WATCH LIST AS POTENTIAL ISLAMIST EXTREMISTS ERIC MOTET IS A LAWYER WHO REPRESENTED SOME OF THOSE STAFF
I THINK HE'S MORE A JUJU DEPOSIT IT IS NICE YOU'RE THERE IS EFFECTIVELY RECRUITMENT GOING ON AT THE AIRPORTS THAT IS CLEAR THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING RADICALISED IN SOME OF THE TRADE UNIONS ACCEPT TRES THE AUTHORITIES HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT WITH THIS PROBLEM IS NOT EASY BECAUSE IT'S A LARGE SECTION OF THE POPULATION THAT IS TARGETED IN THESE ENQUIRIES THE MAJORITY PRACTISED THEIR RELIGION IN A TOTALLY NORMAL FASHION
BUT IT DOES HAPPEN AND IT'S UP TO THE AUTHORITIES TO STOP THEM WHO HAVE COMPARISON JUST A MOMENT LET'S START THERE WITH KEVIN CONNOLLY OUR CORRESPONDENT WHO IS IN CAIRO WHERE KEVIN OBVIOUSLY THE SEARCH IS BEING COORDINATED FROM BUT ALSO FOCUS THIS MORNING SIMPLY ON THE GRIEF OF THE RELATIVES OF THOSE WHO WERE ON BOARD
THAT'S RIGHT JUSTIN I'M HERE AT CAIRO AIRPORT WHERE FAMILIES OF SOME OF THE FOREIGN VICTIMS FRENCH AND KUWAITI OR GATHERING BUT OF COURSE
FROM ALL OVER EGYPT THE RELATIVES OF THE DEAD ARE ALSO NOW STARTING TO CONGREGATE THAT
OF COURSE PUTS PRESSURE ON THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES IT'S FOR THEM REALLY TO FIND THE WRECKAGE AS FAST AS THEY CAN TO LEAD THE RECOVERY EFFORT
AND OF COURSE IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT TEST OF THE COMPETENCE OF THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES WHO PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THEIR NATIONAL SECURITY CREDENTIALS THERE WAS A DEGREE OF EMBARRASSMENT I THINK HERE YESTERDAY WENT ONE POINT EACH IT VERIFIED DEBRIS FOUND FLOATING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AS HAVING COME FROM THE PLANE AND THEN HAD TO RETRACT
WHEN THE GREEK AUTHORITIES EXPRESSED DOUBT ABOUT THAT SO THERE IS HUGE PRESSURE HERE FOR THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT TO FIND RESULTS QUICKLY BUT OF COURSE THE TRUTH IS THAT IT
IS ENORMOUSLY DIFFICULT THE MEDITERRANEAN NOT A TRACKLESS ON UNFATHOMABLE WASTE LIKE THE INDIAN OCEAN BUT IT'S VAST THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT RECOVERY OPERATION AND I THINK WHAT ADDS TO THE AGONIES OF THE FAMILIES IS THE THE REALITY THE UNCHANGEABLE REALITY OF THE MODERN WORLD REALLY THAT FOR EVERY OUNCE OF CONCRETE FACT WE DISCOVER
YOU GET A TON OF SPECULATION AND INTERPRETATION ON THE INTERNET SO NOBODY REALLY DANCED THE BASIC
INTERPRETATION OF THE STORY THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY MORE LIKELY THAN NOT CAUSED BY A TERRORIST ACT
BUT THE TRUTH IS WE KNOW VERY LITTLE MORE IN REAL TERMS THAN WE KNEW THIS TIME YESTERDAY MORNING BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE WRECKAGE OF THE PLANE WHEN IT IS FOUND WILL BE AN EGYPTIAN AIRSPACE WON'T HAVE THEM IN THE AREA THAT THEY'RE SEARCHING MIGHT BE LARGE BUT THEY KNOW ROUGHLY WHERE TO LOOK AND THEY'RE GETTING A FAIR BIT OF INTERNATIONAL HELP
THEY ARE GETTING INTERNATIONAL HELP BRITAIN HAS DEPLOYED AARON SEE ASSETS FRANCE'S OFFERED HELP EGYPT ITSELF HAS A LARGE AND CAPABLE NAVY SO THERE ARE PLENTY OF MARITIME ASSETS
LEADING THE SEARCH IN YOU'RE RIGHT IT CAME DOWN SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE GREEK ISLANDS AND THE EGYPTIAN COAST BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW IF IT BROKE UP ON IMPACT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT SANK MORE OR LESS INTACT OF THERE'S STILL A LOT OF BASIC RECOVERY WORK TO DO AND
IT IS AS I SAY AN IMMENSELY DIFFICULT OPERATION AND I SUPPOSE THE TRUTH IS THAT WE WON'T KNOW VERY MUCH MORE IN PRACTICAL TERMS UNTIL THE FLIGHT RECORDERS ARE RECOVERED THEY OF COURSE CONTAIN THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PLANE IN ITS FINAL FATAL MOMENTS BUT I THINK ONE COMMENT ON
THE SHEER DIFFICULTY OF THAT RECOVERY OPERATION IS SAID HERE IN EGYPT LATER TODAY WE ARE EXPECTING SOME MUSLIM FAMILIES TO GO AHEAD WITH FUNERALS
WHICH WILL BE CONDUCTED AROUND EMPTY COFFINS AND IN THE EGYPTIAN TRADITION THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FEAR THAT THE PROSPECT OF FINDING THE BODY OF THE DEAD IS VERY VERY REMOTE TELLING CAN'T CAIRO AIRPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S TURN TO PARIS FROM WHERE OF COURSE THE PLANE TOOK OFF JONATHAN BLAKE IS A REPORTER WHO IS THERE AND WHAT HAVE THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES JONATHAN SAYING THIS MORNING
THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN MARC SPOKEN ON FRENCH TELEVISION THIS MORNING SAYING WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL POSSIBILITIES BUT NONE IS BEING FAVOURED OVER OTHERS BECAUSE WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION ON THE CAUSES IN OTHER WORDS MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS ON FROM THE FLAME GOING MISSING
WE KNOW NOTHING THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT WILL MEET THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS AT TOMORROW THEY WERE FIFTEEN FRENCH PEOPLE ON BOARD FLIGHT M.A. SATO FOR WHEN IT TOOK OFF FROM CHARLES'S TO GO AIRPORT ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT JUST AFTER ELEVEN O'CLOCK LOCAL TIME AND THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO ASSIST THE EGYPTIANS IN THE SEARCH MISSION AND THE INVESTIGATION INTO
WHAT CAUSED THE PLANE TO CRASH THREE STAR FROM THE AIR ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION BUREAU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM HERE TO CAIRO TO ASSIST AS WELL AS A TECHNICAL ADVISOR FROM AIRBUS THE MAKER OF THE PLANE INVOLVED THERE ARE ALSO FRENCH VESSELS AN AIRCRAFT ASSISTING IN THE SEARCH OPERATION IS YOU MENTIONED A SHORT TIME AGO
HERE IN PARIS THOUGH THE FOCUS WILL BE ON WHAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED HERE CHARLES TO GO AIRPORT PRIOR TO THAT PLANE TAKING OFF WHICH COULD HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON WHAT HAPPENED WAS A DEVICE SMUGGLED ON BOARD WAS THERE ANY INTERFERENCE FROM
ANY OF THE AIRPORT STAFF OR ANYONE ELSE HERE BEFORE THE PLANE TOOK OFF BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED JUST NOW THERE HAS BEEN A FOCUS ON THE EIGHTY THOUSAND ALSO WORKERS HERE AT CHANCE TO GO AIRPORT YOU HAVE AIRSIDE ACCESS AND SOME OF WHOM HAVE HAD THEIR SECURITY CLEARANCE REVOKED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AS FRANCE CONTINUES TO BE ON A VERY HIGH STATE OF ALERT SINCE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS HERE AT THE END OF LAST YEAR
JOHN THE BLAKE THANK YOU LET'S TURN NOW TO CAPTAIN MIGHT VIVIAN WHO WAS A FORMER HEAD OF FLIGHT OPERATIONS AT THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY AND HAS ALSO BEEN A SECURITY ADVISOR TO VIRGIN ATLANTIC AND IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING TIM HOW CADDY MAYBE I SUPPOSE THE FIRST QUESTION IS JUST GOING BACK TO THE SEARCH ITSELF ED AND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS AN AREA THAT THEY'RE CONCENTRATING ON AND THEY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF ROUGHLY WHERE THE PLANE CAME DOWN THE WEATHER WAS ALL RIGHT THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF RESOURCES THERE WOULD YOU EXPECT THAT THAT IT IS FOUND PRETTY QUICKLY
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A BIT AND WHEN I USED TO FLY THAT AREA IT WAS VERY HEAVILY POLICED IN TERMS OF RADAR MONITORING THE SATELLITE MONITORING THERE'S LOTS OF SHIPS AROUND HER CLOSE IT'S VERY CLOSE TO A VOLATILE AREAS YOU KNOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THAT PART OF THE WORLD IS UNSTABLE SO IT IS MONITORED BY ALL SORTS OF COUNTRIES AND ORGANISATIONS SO YES THE ANSWER IS I WOULD EXPECTED TO BE FOUND RELATIVELY QUICKLY YOU SURPRISED IT HASN'T BEEN SO FAR
I AM SURPRISED I AM SURPRISED ON THAT I'M SURPRISED NOBODY'S CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT IF INDEED THERE IS SOMEBODY RESPONSIBLE FOR IT IT WOULD IT SUGGEST IF THERE ISN'T WRECKAGE THAT THAT EASILY VISIBLE WOULD SUGGEST YOU WERE IT WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST WOULDN'T IT DEAR AS A COMMONSENSE INTERPRETATION OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT IT THAT IT HIT THE WATER RELATIVELY INTACT
POSSIBLY BUT THESE AIRCRAFTS TODAY HAVE PARTS OF THEM WHICH ARE VERY THEY FLOAT VERY EASILY THEY'RE HONEYCOMB STRUCTURE OFTEN THEIR WINGS THEIR SEAT CUSHIONS ALL THIS SORT OF STUFF YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE THAT PRETTY QUICKLY
THERE WAS A SECURITY CREW THERE WAS A CREW ANYWHERE TEN PEOPLE AND WHAT WE SEEM TO BE UNDERSTANDING AT THE MOMENT I KNOW THESE THINGS SOMETIMES CHANGE THEY'RE MISUNDERSTOOD BUT THEY WERE ACTUALLY SEVERAL SECURITY OFFICERS ON THE PLANE WHAT WOULD THAT BE NORMAL TO YOU
THAT'S A GOOD POINT WHEN I SAW THE INFORMATION YESTERDAY I WAS SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER OF ALLEGED CREW ON BOARD I SAY ALLEGED BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT ON AN AIRCRAFT OF THAT SIZE MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR CARRYING TENANTS AND TWO TO FLIGHT DECK HER CAPTAIN THE FIRST TOFFS
OBVIOUSLY THE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE I'VE PURSUED HIM AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEING SAID WORST SECURITY AGENTS OR OUR EQUIVALENT TO SKY MARSHALS THE NUMBER SURPRISES ME SLIGHTLY BUT GIVEN THE STATE OF SECURITY IN EGYPT AT THE MOMENT ANXIETIES OF THEIR BEING EXPRESSED PARTICULARLY BETWEEN EGYPT AND FRANCE THEN I'M NOT I SUPPOSE IN CONTEXT IT'S SIX DESPICABLE AND THE OTHER THING THAT PEOPLE HAVE FOCUSED ON IS WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED IN THE AIR THE PLANE SWERVED TO LEFT AND RIGHT
UNUSUAL THAT IT REMINDS ME OF A SEVEN FORTY SEVEN INSTANT WITH BRITISH AIRWAYS MANY YEARS AGO A ROUTE FROM LONDON TO NAIROBI AND SOMEBODY GOT ON THE FLIGHT DECK AND CRIED THE CONTROLS OF THE AIRCRAFT DID ENGAGE IN SOME PRETTY VIOLENT MOVEMENTS THE INTRUDER WAS OVERCOME BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR CASE HERE YESTERDAY IT LOOKS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THIS WAS CONSISTENT WITH SOME SORT OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IT IT'S OBVIOUSLY
IF ONE'S INCLINED TO GO TOWARDS THE THEORY THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME INTERFERENCE FROM THE AIRCRAFT AND ON THE FLIGHT DECK OR WITH THE CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT AND WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT THE SITUATION SHOUT THE GIRL EXTRAORDINARY REALLY THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE SHELTER GO AIRPORT HAD THEIR RIGHT TO BE WORKING THERE RESCINDED RELATIVELY RECENTLY NUMBER OF AIRPORTS WILL HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES
DEAL WITH I SUPPOSE BUT IT DID FOR HER TAKING A STEP BACK AND LOOKING IN THE ROUND AT AIRPORT SECURITY NOT JUST AT THAT AIRPORT HOW
HOW MUCH HAVE WE MANAGED TO BEAR DOWN ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT PEOPLE ON THE GROUND CAN GET DEVICES ON BOARD PLANES WERE NOT PASSENGERS
THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING POINT THE INSIDE A THREAT AS IT'S TERMED WHERE YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY HAS GOT ACCESS TO AIRSIDE REMAINS THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT I THINK IT'S ABOUT EIGHTY PEOPLE SHALL SICKLE LOST THEIR SECURITY CLEARANCE BECAUSE OF WHAT'S CALLED RELIC PLANTATION
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT A HUNDRED PER CENT SAFE OR WILL KNOW MAKE AN ABSENT SECURE WOULD BE DISHONEST IF WE SAID WE COULD PUT SECURITY IN THIS INSTANCE IS BUILT ON LEVELS PROVE BREACH ONE LEVEL AND THE NEXT LEVEL CATCHES STOPS IT GOING FURTHER THAT'S THE IDEA THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF LEVELS STARTING WITH WITH BEFORE YOU EVEN BUY A TICKET REALLY WHEN YOU BUY A TICKET
BUT I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE I WROTE ABOUT IT RECENTLY IN AN ARTICLE I THINK THERE'S MORE STEPS COULD BE TAKEN BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE AREAS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE WEAKER THAN OTHERS AND THE WEAKEST LINK THIS SYSTEM IS AS GOOD AS THAT THAT THE STEPS LIKE WAR
WELL I THINK WE COULD UTILISE THE CREW'S MORE THAN WE DO AT THE MOMENT TO REPORT USE THEM AS THE EYES AND EARS FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN THIS INSTANCE WE ASKED THEM TO REPORT ALL SORTS OF THINGS WHEN I WAS FLYING YOU DID LOTS OF FORMS I HATE TO INTRODUCE MORE FORMS FOR AIRCREW BUT I THINK WE COULD DO THAT I THINK WE COULD ENHANCE PROFILING SPECIFIC TYPE OF FAITH I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MINORITIES RUNNING LIKE THAT BUT THERE ARE WAYS OF DOING THIS
FACIAL RECOGNITION ALL SORTS OF PROCEDURES PEOPLE ON THE AIRSIDE CLEARLY THE PROCEDURES FOR CHECKING THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ACCESS HAS TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN AND I'D LIKE ALSO TO SEE FOR EXAMPLE
THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF WORKERS TO REPORT ON WORKERS ARE SORT OF WHISTLE BLOWING WHICH I DON'T THINK'S THERE AND IT'S AGGRAVATED BY THE FACT THAT OFTEN THE GROUND AGENCIES ARE OUTSOURCE THEY'RE NOT EMPLOYERS OF THE AIR OF THE AIRLINE OUTSOURCED TO OTHER COMPANIES AND THE AIRLINE OF COURSE HAS MORE A CONNECTION WITH THAT SORT OF ORGANISATION CAPTAIN MIGHT THE FORMER HEAD OF FLIGHT OPERATIONS AT THE C.A.A. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT HE'S DONE WHAT'S MORE EVEN THE OFFER OF SIXTY EIGHT MILLION POUNDS APPARENTLY WON'T CHANGE HIS MIND WHAT WHITE WHAT DID DANIEL CRAIG IS SAID TO BE NOT READY TO PLAY JAMES BOND AGAIN HE'S TOLD M.G.M. STUDIOS THAT THEIR GENEROUS OFFER WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND SO WHO SHOULD COME NEXT AND DOES WHOEVER IT IS HAS TO BE A POSH WHITE
MAN I'M JOINED BY THE FILM CRITIC CAN CHRIS AND A BITCH AND ALSO BY A.J. CHOWDRY IS EDITOR OF KISS KISS BANG BANG THE JOURNAL OF THE CHAINS BOND INTERNATIONAL FAN CLUB SPLENDID NAME KISS KISS BANG BANG HOW SOON DO WE NEED TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS A.J. IF THE STUDIO OR ACTUALLY TO GET THE NEXT BOND FILM OUT OF THE STUDIO IN TIME
I THINK THE NEW BOND FILM IS DUE IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND BUT I THINK REPORTS OF DANIEL CRAIG'S DEMISE DOUBLE OH SEVEN ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED I THINK THEY'RE STILL WORKING ON THE SCRIPT I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS THE SILLY SEASON FOR RUMOURS SPECTRE THE LAST BOND FILM WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL EVER IT'S OUT ON BLU RAY NOUN IS FANTASTIC IT WAS A CULMINATION I THINK OF DINING CRAZE REIGN AS JAMES BOND WHICH REINVIGORATED THE FRANCHISE THE ONLY COMMERCIALLY BUT CRITICALLY THERE ARE TWO REASONS PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT
HE'S REPORTED COMMENTS AS HE HAD ENOUGH AND DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT AGAIN BUT ALSO THE BOOKIES STOPPING TAKING BETS ON TOM MEDALS TO REPLACING
DANIEL CRAIG IS RECANTED THOSE REMARKS HE MADE AND THE BOOKIES ALWAYS GET IT WRONG IF I IF I HAD A PENNY FOR EVERY TIME THE BOOKIE STOPPED TAKING BETS ON WHO CAN DO THE TITLE SONG THEME SONG IS JUST ONE OF THE WAYS IT'S A SIGN OF HOW IMPORTANT BOND IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT ON THIS GREAT SHOW WELL THE GREAT THING IS WE'VE NOW ESTABLISHED THIS IS ENTIRELY IDLE SPECULATION JOY BUT NEVERTHELESS LET'S TURN TO YOU KAREN
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE IDEA OF HILL STONE OR IS THERE A LITTLE BIT OF YOU TEMPTED TO REALLY RING THE CHANGES AND HAVE A JAMES BOND A WOMAN INSTEAD WELL I THINK THAT'S PUSHING IT A LITTLE TOO FAR OUT A SEPARATE JANE BOND FRANCHISE PERHAPS BUT THE BOND FRANCHISE AS WORTH TOO MUCH IT'S THE LONGEST RUNNING FRANCHISE AS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE MULTI BILLION POUND INDUSTRY GLOBALLY IT'S A BRILLIANT
SO THEY HAVE TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL WITH IT IT HAS WITHSTOOD MANY THREATS BORN AUSTIN POWERS FOR EXAMPLE AND I THINK THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE AS THE CULTURE CHANGES NOW WHETHER IT WOULD BE IDRIS ELBA OR WHETHER IT WOULD BE TOWNHILL STONE THAT'S GOING TO BE DOWN TO BARBARA BROCCOLI BUT CHANGING GENDERS YOU THINK WOULD BREAK THE BRAD HAVE BEEN CRUDELY SPEAK YOU SAY YOU CAN'T SELL JAMES BOND AFTERSHAVE WATCHES
PROMOTION WITH CARS IF THEY'LL HUMPS PERHAPS WE WERE WE ARE DOING A GOOD SHOW OUT IN THE GREEN ROOM THERE AND HE WAS SAYING THAT ANY AND I AGREE THAT BARN AS AS AS A BRAND AND IT WOULD BE BANNED BY A WOMAN IT WOULD BE BANNED BUT BUT A BLACK OR IT WOULD BE BAD BUT GAY SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF IDENTITY OF THE BARD THAT CANNOT CHANGE
DO YOU AGREE THAT IT CAN'T BE ONE AND I COULD BE ONLY ONE BOND HAS JUST BEGINNING COULD BE ANYONE NO I'VE JUST CO WRITTEN A BOOK WITH MATTY FEEL CAUSE SOME KIND OF HERO ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE BOND FILMS AND THERE YOU SEE ALL SORTS OF PERMUTATIONS IDEAS THROUGHOUT HISTORY THEY'VE HAD AT THE ACTS THEY NORMALLY WANT TO BE JAMES BOND PEOPLE HAD ROGER MOORE AND PIERCE BROSNAN WERE LOOKED AT
TEN YEARS BEFORE THEY BECAME JAMES BOND AND I THINK BOND IS JUST BEGINNING A BOND LIKE SHERLOCK HOLMES OR TARZAN AND THESE CLASSICAL LITERARY CHARACTERS MEMBER BOND IS A LITERARY CHARACTER FROM FLEMING JUST BEGINNING TO THINK THERE'S A VAST EVOLUTION WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT FIFTY YEARS A BOND WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN WITH JAMES BOND AND I THINK BOND IS FOREVER AS CUBBY BROCCOLI SAID
LET'S GO FOR PREFERENCES THEN KAREN IF IT WAS UP TO YOU IF YOU LOOK UP AT BOTTLE IF YOU HAD TO DECIDE I LIKE HENRY CAVILL FRANKLY BUT WHETHER THAT HE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HE WAS ACTUALLY VYING WITH DANIEL CRAIG WHO DOESN'T LIKE TELL MIDDLETON PARTICULARLY AFTER THE NIGHT MANAGER IT'S WIDE OPEN AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT BOND IS THAT BAND
IS NOTED AS A SURPRISE IT ALWAYS BRINGS OR SOMETHING NO BUT IN OUR DUAL KEY POINT I THINK IS YOU CAN MOVE WITH THE CULTURE I CAN'T STRETCH IT TOO FAR WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN LEAD BUT BARNETT HAS ALWAYS HAD TO CHANGE THE CULTURE TIMOTHY DALTON HAVING TO TO DEAL WITH WITH SHORT HAIRED NOT MORE ASSERTIVE WOMEN RATHER THAN THE PUPPIES AND KITTENS THAT THAT CHANT KINDLY PLAYED WITH FORGIVE ME BITS IN A VERY SIMPLISTIC ABOUT A.J. BUT HOW WOULD YOU DO BONDS WOMANISING IT BOND IS A WOMAN
IS THAT NOT CENTRAL TO THE COULDN'T YOU LOVE BOND BOYS I MEAN I THINK WE CAN HAVE EVERYTHING THESE DAYS WITH ME TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY HAD I THINK WE'RE JUST BEGINNING WITH BOND ALL THE PERMUTATIONS YOU COULD I MEAN THOSE ARE SILLY THINGS WE CAN GET OVER THAT QUITE EASILY IS AN EMAIL JOHN BELEM HAS EMAILED US TO HIS LEAVE BOND UNLOAD HE SAYS HE WASN'T BLACK HE WASN'T A WOMAN HE WAS A WHITE SHOVER THIS KILLER WITH GREAT TASTE AND CHARM THAT'S HOW WE LOVE HIM LEAVE IT AT THAT PLEASE
THAT'S WHERE HE'S NOT RUNNING THE FRANCHISE YES IT IS NOT IN A POSITION TO OFFER SIXTY EIGHT MILLION POUNDS JUST A BRIEF FINAL WHY MIGHT DANIEL CRAIG FUND THAT'S A BURDEN IF YOU BELIEVE ANY OF THE THINGS HE DID ONCE THEY WANTED TO SLASH HIS WRISTS YES WELL HE COMPLAINS A LOT BUT BARN THIS IS IS A CAREER BREAK OR IN A CAREER MAKER AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT REMEMBER KAREN CHRIS OUT OF IT A.J. CHERRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TO GARY WITHOUT COMMENT TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES
VERY WISE IT'S GOING TO BE NOT STIRRED IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE A GENERALLY CLOUDY BUT DRY DAY AT HEADINGLEY WHERE THE TEST MATCH WILL START IN JUST OVER A COUPLE OF HOURS WITH ENGLAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE FOR FIVE AGAINST SRI LANKA HALES SEVENTY ONE NOT OUT THERE STOW FIFTY FIVE SO THOUGHTS FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN AGNEW
BEST THOSE OVERRIDING AMBITION IS TO SCORE A TEST CENTURY AT HEADINGLEY AND TODAY HE GETS HIS CHANCE RESUMING ON FIFTY FOUR BEST I WAS THE ONLY BATSMAN TO PLAY POSITIVELY YESTERDAY HALES NORMALLY PUGNACIOUS RIGHT DECIDED TO SHOW HIS DEFENSIVE GAME AND HE'LL HAVE STRENGTHENED HIS CREDENTIALS WITH A DETERMINED INNINGS OF SEVENTY ONE COOK CHASED A WIDE ONE SO STILL NEEDS TWENTY TO REGISTER TEN THOUSAND RUNS COMPTON GOT A GOOD DELIVERY THIRD BALL ROUTE ALSO REGISTERED A RARE FAILURE
VINCE DROVE AIRILY FOR NINE AND STOKES AS CAUGHT AT MID ON FOR TWELVE OR SRI LANKA SEEM AS TOOK CONTROL AND ENGLAND LOST FIVE FOR THIRTY FOUR SHANIKA TAKING THREE IN HIS FIRST THREE OVERS IN TEST CRICKET SO ALEX HALES SEVENTY ONE AND HERE'S HOW HE READS THE MATCH THE FIRST HOUR LEAGUE CAN BE MASSIVE IN SHADE IN THIS GAME IF WE CAN GET THROUGH
WE'VE GOT WITH WITH NO LOSSES PUT US IN THE DRIVING SEAT AND AGAIN IF I TAKE ONE OR TWO PUT THEM IN DRIVING CAESAR AT THE MOMENT I SAY IT'S DELICATELY BALANCE MAYBE SLIGHTLY IN FAVOUR OF THEM BUT WE'VE GOT MOMENTUM WITH HIS PARTNER
TEST MATCH SPECIAL RADIO FOUR LONG WAY FROM FIVE LIVE SPORTS EXTRA FOR ALL THE ACTION AT MUIRFIELD HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE SPORT'S GOVERNING BODY THAT IT WON'T STAGE THE OPEN GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER THE COURSE DECIDED TO MAINTAIN ITS BAN ON WOMEN MEMBERS RORY MCELROY IS ONE OF MANY TOP PLAYERS WHO TAKE A VERY DIM VIEW ON MOORFIELDS POLICY
IT'S DISAPPOINTING IN THEIR FIELD IT IS ITS OWN CLUB AND IT HAS ITS OWN MEMBERS AND THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT THEY GAS BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT TO HOST THE WORLD'S BIGGEST GOLF TOURNAMENT AT THIS THAT DOESN'T ALLOW WOMEN TO BE MEMBERS SO HOPEFULLY
AND WE CAN GET HER BACK ON THE OPEN ONE DAY BUT THERE'S PLENTY MORE GREAT COURSES ON THE OPEN ORDER THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO I THINK IT'S MORE OF A LOSS TO MUIRFIELD AND TO

ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE LOSING IF THESE PROPOSALS ARE ACCEPTED A MIDWEEK GAMES SO THE LONG TRIPS FROM ONE END OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER ON A TUESDAY NIGHT TO SEE YOUR TEAM ARE IN THE MING GOING TO DISAPPEAR BUT THERE'S A BALANCED VIEW TO BE TAKEN I THINK THE LESS GAMES GOING GOING DOWN TO THIRTY EIGHT GAME SEASON WILL ACTUALLY MAKE THE SATURDAYS AT THE STADIUMS AND MORE SPECIAL
AND LESS OF THEM THE MOST SPECIAL THE MORAL PART OF THE GAME SO YOUR TIME WILL TELL HOW THAT BIT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE RECEIVED BUT I'M HOPEFUL IT WAS POSITIVE

WE HAVE NO TRADE BARRIERS AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS SO IF YOU'RE OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL YOU WANT OF THOSE PARTICULAR ADVANTAGES AND IF YOU'RE GOING OUT OF THE SINGLE MARKET AS ADVOCATED BY MY GALL OF WELL THEN YOU HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION IN TERMS OF HOW YOU WERE SHE RELEASE WOULD BE EXISTING TWENTY SEVEN MEMBER STATES UNTREATED THAT DO YOU SEND THE DRAZEN CULTURE MINISTERS WOULD SAY TO YOU IN OTHER COUNTRIES IF BRITAIN LEAVES WE MUST DIRECTS NEW BARRIERS ARE PUT ON TERRACE BUT ON TAXES
NO IT'S THE UNITED KINGDOM AND MAKE THAT DECISION IF YOU'RE PART OF A SINGLE MARKET YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PARTICIPATE AS PART OF THE RULES OF THE OF THE TRADING REGIME IS PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE ME TALK TO TO DO WHAT I'M TRYING TO ASK THERE IS OF COURSE THE BRITISH WOULD SAY A BRITISH GOVERNMENT AFTERWARDS THEY WERE ALL LIKE IT PRETTY MUCH AS IT IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO TELL US WHY YOU THINK THAT WOULD CHANGE
WELL YOU SHOULD ASK THE NORWEGIANS AND THE SWISS WHO ARE ACTUALLY OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THEY CHOSE TO BE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET THE ROOM BELIEVES CAMPAIGNER SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO BE OUT OF THE SINGLE MARKET SO IF YOU WOULD BE SOME FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF TRADE BUT NOT PEOPLE SAY OFF AND ON THE LEAVES I DID YOU KNOW IS THAT THE FRENCH WOULD STILL WANT TO SELL US THEIR CHEESE FOR EXAMPLE SO WE WOULDN'T BE IN THEIR INTERESTS TO HAVE A TRADE WAR OVER AGRICULTURAL GOOD
BUT THIS IS NOT A PORTRAIT WAS ABOUT RENEGOTIATING THE EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE TWENTY SEVEN MEMBER STATES AND THE CONDITIONS OF A CUSTOM JOIN IN THE CONDITIONS OF TARIFFS THAT WOULD APPLY IN THAT EVENT SO YOU KNOW THIS NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE EITHER IN THE TWENTY EIGHT MEMBER STATES BLOCK AT THE MOMENT OF MAKE DO HERE IS PUT ALL OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SINGLE MARKET AND TRADED OR YOUR ENOUGH PHIL HOGAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU
BUT I'M SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE I'LL BE ABOUT TO START FRACKING OR AT LEAST TAKE A STEP TOWARDS THE CONTROVERSIAL PROCESS BECOMING PART OF OUR ENERGY FUTURE HAS BEEN ON HOLD SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN FOLLOWING MINOR EARTHQUAKES NEAR BLACKPOOL COUNTY COUNCIL OFFICERS IN NORTH YORKSHIRE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT A TEST SITE BE ALLOWED NEAR THE VILLAGE OF KIRKBY MUST FOR THEM BUT THE FINAL DECISION IS GOING TO TAKE BACK COUNSELLORS WHO ARE FACING QUITE A FEW PROCESS RESIDENTS AND FROM ENVIRONMENTALISTS
PEOPLE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR THE NOISES OFF WHICH IS FLAMINGO LAND JUST BEHIND US WHICH IS THE LARGEST TOURIST ATTRACTION IN YORKSHIRE THIS IS GOING TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON TOURISM IT ALREADY HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON SOME LOCAL BED AND BREAKFAST ACCOMMODATION
PEOPLE WHO NORMALLY COME ASKING WHAT'S HAPPENING ABOUT THIS FRACKING I'M NOT BOOKING IN AGAIN THIS YEAR I THINK IT'S A MOST UNFORTUNATE POSITION FOR US TO BE HERE BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE
HAVING A DECISION FOISTED UPON THIS I THINK THE DAMAGE TO HER OWN VALMONT ONTO OUR VILLAGE WILL BE GREAT PARTICULARLY THE EXCESS WITH TRAFFIC WILL BE INVOLVED BORACIC ALARMED HIS THIRD ENERGIES CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND HE HAS BEEN EXPLAINING TO ME WHAT HIS COMPANY IS HOPING TO GET OUT OF THIS DRILLING THIS PARTICULAR OPERATION HE'S A TEST WE DRILLED A WELL IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THAT IS NON DRILLING INVOLVED WITH THIS OPERATION
WHAT WE HOPE TO DO IS TO SEE IF THE GAS FLOWS AND IF IF THERE IS A GAS FLOW MEASURE IT FOR
ENOUGH TIME SO IT'S AN EXPLORATION AND A TEST BUT YOU WOULDN'T DO IT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT HOPE THAT THAT YOU WOULD FIND A QUANTITY OF GAS THERE PRESUMABLY WELL ARE WE IN THE GAS INDUSTRY AND FOR THAT MOTOR OIL INDUSTRY WHAT WE DO IS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTION AND IT IS VERY NORMAL BUSINESS TO EXPLORE FOR
THE POSSIBILITY OF PRODUCING HYDROCARBONS AND NORMAL AS WELL THAT IF YOU LIVE AROUND A SITE LIKE THIS YOU'D BE WORRIED WOULDN'T YOU WHAT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO LOCAL RESIDENTS
WE HAVE BEEN DRILLING AND PRODUCING FROM THIS SITE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS THE WELL WE DRILLED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WITHIN WHICH THIS FRACK WILL TAKE PLACE IS CALLED KING HIM HATE
INDICATING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EIGHT WELL'S DRILLED WITHOUT ANY INCIDENT WITHOUT ANY IMPACT ON THEIR LOCALITY WHATSOEVER OR TWENTY YEARS
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE ARE OBJECTING TO THESE PLANS NOW BECAUSE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW AT THE MOMENT THAT WE CARRIED OUT EXTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS BEFORE PUTTING A PLANNING APPLICATION IN AND WE HEARD PEOPLE'S CONCERNS AND OBJECTIONS ADDRESSED HIM IN OUR APPLICATION
SUBSEQUENTLY THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT OFF NOT YOUR COUNTY COUNCIL CARRIED OUT EXTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS FOR THEMSELVES DURING WHICH PEOPLE HAVE RAISED CONCERNS END PROVIDED OBJECTIONS AND THOSE WHAT ADDRESSED
SIMILARLY AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY CONSULTATIONS TOOK PLACE AND THERE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED ONE OF THE ISSUES IN LANCASHIRE WHERE A PLANNING APPLICATION WAS EVENTUALLY TURNED DOWN THE THING THAT SEEM TO CAUSE THE GREATEST PROBLEM WASN'T ACTUALLY THE PROCESS UNDERGROUND IT WAS THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THERE'D BE SO MANY LORRIES ON THE TOP OF THE GROUND AND A DAILY INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF VEHICLE MOVEMENTS AND PRESUMABLY THAT'S A PROBLEM YOU'RE GOING TO FACE OF PEOPLE AROUND THE SITE ARE GOING TO FACE AS WELL THIS PARTICULAR OPERATION IS MUCH SMALLER
AND HAS FEWER TRAFFIC MOMENTS THEN THE WELL DRILLED BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND PREVIOUS WALES AS WELL SO IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC MOMENT IT'S FAR LESS IN BET THEN PREVIOUSLY WHEN THERE WAS A CONCERN FINAL POINT IS THE WIDER ONE THE ENVIRONMENTAL ONE THAT SAYS ACTUALLY WE DON'T NEED FRACKING IN THIS COUNTRY WE DO NEED FRACKING ANYWHERE BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE LEAVING HYDROCARBONS IN THE GROUND WE'VE GOT TO FIND OTHER WAYS OF GETTING OUR ENERGY FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE
HOW IMPORTANT WOULD YOU SAY IT IS FOR THIS COUNTRY THAT SITES LIKE YOURS ARE EXPLOITED WE HAVE BEEN ON RECORD AS HAIRS A WHAT INDUSTRY THAT WE SEE
THERE'S THE BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE WHERE WE SEE THE RENEWABLES PROVIDING THE MAJORITY OFF ELECTRICITY THE SECOND THING IS EIGHTY PERCENT OF HOMES IN THE U.K. USE GAS AND WE'VE CONTINUED TO DO SO SO GAS WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ENERGY MAKES
OH THAT WAS WRITING THE LAND WHO IS INVOLVED IN THAT EFFORT TO GET PLANNING PERMISSION FINALLY GRANTED FOR HIS SITE IN NORTH YORKSHIRE NOT SURE ACTUALLY WHETHER THE DECISION COMES TODAY I HAVE A FEELING HE MIGHT NOT COME TILL MONDAY IT IS ELEVEN MINUTES TONIGHT AND IT'S ONE HUNDRED YEARS TO THE DAY SINCE ERNEST SHACKLETON AND SIX FELLOW CREWMAN HAVE THE ENDURANCE WHICH HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN PACK ICE AND CRUSHED
REACH THE WHALING STATION AT STROMNESS ON SOUTH GEORGIA TO RAISE THE ALARM IT WAS OF COURSE AN EPIC JOURNEY ACROSS HUNDREDS OF MILES OF OPEN OCEAN ICE FLOWS AND MOUNTAINS THANKS TO SHACKLETON'S HEROICS NOT ONE MEMBER OF HIS PARTY DIED CENTENARY SERVICE OF THANKSGIVING FOR THE COURAGE AND ENDURANCE OF SIR ERNEST SHACKLETON AND HIS MEN IS BEING HELD LATER THIS MORNING AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY PRINCESS ANNE AND ERNEST SHACKLETON'S GRANDDAUGHTER WILL READ FROM HIS DIARY HERE IS HIS ENTRY ON THE MOMENT HE REACHED STROMNESS
THE MORNING OF MAY BE EIGHTH BROKE THICK AND STORMY WITH SCORES FROM THE NORTH WEST
WE SEARCH THE WATERS AHEAD FOR A SIGN OF LAND AND THERE WE COULD SEE NOTHING MORE THAN MET OUR EYES FOR MANY DAYS WE WERE CHEERED BY A SENSE THAT THE GOAL WAS NEAR AT HAND
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK THAT MORNING WE PASSED A LITTLE BIT OF KELP ARE GLAD SIGNAL OF THE PROXIMITY OF LAND
AN HOUR LATER WE SAW TWO SHAGS SITTING ON A BIG MASS OF KELP AND KNEW THEN THAT WE MUST BE WITHIN TEN OR FIFTEEN MILES OF THE SHORE
THESE BIRDS ARE ASHORE AN INDICATION OF THE PROXIMITY OF LAND AS A LIGHTHOUSES FOR THEY NEVER VENTURE FAR TO SEE
WE GAZED TO HEAD WITH INCREASING EAGERNESS AND A TWELVE THIRTY P.M. THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS MCCARTHY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE BLACK CLIFFS OF SOUTH GEORGIA JUST FOURTEEN DAYS AFTER A DEPARTURE FROM ELEPHANT ISLAND
IT WAS A GLAD MOMENT FIRST WRITTEN KILLED AND WE COS WE WERE HAPPINESS IRRADIATED
THE JOB WAS NEARLY DONE
EARLIER TODAY I DID SPEAK TO ERNEST SHACKLETON'S GRANDDAUGHTER ALEXANDRA IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS IN MY GRANDFATHER'S LIFE EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE HE HARPED UP HIS MEN WERE ON ELEPHANT ISLAND NO WHEN YOU'RE MAROONED EFFECTIVELY HE TOOK A NOT QUITE TWENTY THREE FOOT BOAT AND FIVE COMPANIONS
AND THIS AMAZING VOYAGE EIGHT HUNDRED MILES ACROSS THE STORMY SEAS IN THE WORLD THEY MADE IT SOMEHOW GOT TO SOUTH GEORGIA THE WRONG SIDE NOT WHETHER WHALING STATIONS WELL NEITHER MY GRANDFATHER WITH COMPANIONS WERE CLIMBERS THEY CLIMB AND THOUGH IT'S INTERIOR SOUTH GEORGIA WAS NOT MAPS THEY DID THE CLIMB THEY GOT LOST SEVERAL TIMES
DID THIRTY MILES IN THIRTY SIX HOURS THE SERVICE MARKS THE MOMENT WHEN IF THEY WERE IN THE RIGHT PLACE THEY WOULD HEAR THE WHALER THE WHALERS WHISTLE CALLING THE WHALERS TO WORK FROM STROMNESS AND THEY DID HERE ERIC AND ERNIE SHACKLETON DESCRIBE THE SWEETEST MUSIC HUMAN EVER HARD COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN SEE LIFE AND DEATH AND WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS WORTH REMEMBERING A HUNDRED YEARS ON
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THIS ENORMOUS IMPACT THE SHACKLETON SUE COME AND EVERYONE IS IF YOU HAVE TO FIND MY HIS LEADERSHIP THE WAY HE LED HIS MEN HE WAS UNUSUAL LEADER FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO HE COULD DO ANY JOB ON AN EXPEDITION HOWEVER MENIAL HE TOOK GREAT TROUBLE TO GET TO KNOW HIS MAN AND HE ENCOURAGED THEM ABOVE ALL
THE FEELING THAT AS THOUGH HE EXPECTED THEM TO BE LOYAL TO HIM OR SO HE WILL BE LOYAL TO THEIR MUM AND YOU'RE ALSO EXPECTED LOYALTY FOR THEM TO EACH OTHER ON THE EXPEDITION AS A WHOLE AND YOU'RE GOING ALONG WITH OTHER PEOPLE OF COURSE TO BE DOING SOME READINGS TODAY AT THE ABBEY YES I'M DELIGHTED WESTMINSTER ABBEY AS NEARLY FOUR OR TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE AT HOLES I'M DOING A READING FROM FRANK WORSLEY MY GRANDFATHER'S
CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP AND ENDURANCE AND BRILLIANT NAVIGATOR FOUND SOUTH GEORGIA I'M DOING A READING FROM WORSLEY IS BOOK ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT OF SHACKLETON AND ENDURANCE COMES FROM A FAMILY MOTTO THAT NAME OF THE SHIP YES MY FAMILY WATERS ENDURE EM BY ENDURANCE WE CONQUER AND THAT'S WHAT YOU LIKE PEOPLE TO REMEMBER TODAY YEAH HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO ABSOLUTELY
ALEXANDER SHACKLE ON THERE TALKING WITH HER GRANDFATHER'S ADVENTURES A TIME SEVEN MINUTES TONIGHT NO MANCHESTER IS OF COURSE THE MUSICAL CAPITAL OF BRITAIN A MODEST CLAIM WHICH IS IN NO WAY INFLUENCE BY THE FACT THAT IT'S MY HOME CITY BUT IT IS THIS IT'S IN DANGER OF TRADING ON ITS PAST AT THE CLAIM OF THE MAN HE WANTS TO BE MANCHESTER'S FIRST DIRECTLY ELECTED MAYOR ANDY BURNHAM HE'S COME OVER ALL NOSTALGIC FOR THE MUSIC OF HIS AND MY TEENAGE YEARS
OF COURSE BUT THE HAPPY MONDAYS THE INSPIRAL CARPETS NEW ORDER AND THE STONE ROSES THAT'S WAS BURNED AND GOT A POINT OR HE'S A MIDDLE AGED POLITICIAN NOT PERHAPS THE ONLY DEAL PERSON TO JUDGE THE STRENGTH OF THE POPULAR MUSIC SCENE TERRY CHRISTIAN JOIN IS ON THE LINE FROM SALFORD MORNING TO YOU TERRY JOHNS ROBIN'S ON HIS STUDIO WITH US HERE BOTH ME MORNING UNLESS OF COURSE TERRY FIRST OF ALL AS BURNHAM RIGHT
MUSIC BUSINESS HAS CHANGED COMPLETELY AND AGAIN YOU KNOW MANCHESTER HAS BEEN A BIT STEREOTYPED JUST THERE YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT THE MANCHESTER ERA THE BIGGEST SELLING BAND IN GENERAL AGREE WITH THIS AT THE MANCHESTER AREA ERA FOR MANCHESTER WERE SIMPLY RED PROBABLY OUTSOLD ALL THE REST PUT TOGETHER WAS A TAD MORE RADIO TWO THAT ANYTHING ELSE NOT REALLY ME THAT STUFF HAS BEEN PLAYED WAS POPULAR IN MANCHESTER BUT ONE SAME AS MANCHESTER HAS ALWAYS HAD A VERY VARIED AND BROAD SEE THAT'S KIND OF YOU KNOW SORT OF GROUND IN THAT WAY THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT ANDY BUT
ANDY BURNHAM GOD BLESS HIM HE'S A LOVELY BLOKE BUT HE WAS KIND OF YOU KNOW CULTURAL SECRETARY WASN'T IAN YOU KNOW THE SPORT MEDIA AND ALL THE REST OF IT
HE DIDN'T DO MUCH IN THAT ONE YEAR IN POWER AND I DO FEEL A BIT SORRY FOR HIM BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S LIKE A TOURIST IN THE NORTH NOWADAYS AWAY TALKS ABOUT THE NORTH AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WOULD BE VERELL LIVES THERE HE HAS HIS HOME HIS FAMILY HE SAID LOOK NOBODY IN THE NORTH WHAT WOULD WANTS WOULD SAY THEY WANTED TO BE A LAWYER OR A DOCTOR I MEAN IT'S A BIT LIKE YOU WANT TO BE KING THAT THE NORTH NOW WITHOUT ME GETTING ALL GAME OF THRONES ON YOU BUT THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T WANNA BE WARMING THE BENCH FOR JEREMY CORBETT ANY MORE SO I'VE GOT TO COME UP HERE AND THIS WORKS
WHAT WHAT SHOULD HE BE HEARING JOHN ROB BUT HE'S NOT LISTENING TO IF YOU WANT TO ASSERT THEIR MANCHESTER'S MUSIC I THINK TO BE FAIR TO ANDY BURNHAM FUN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I DID THAT AT ALL I WAS A COMPERE THAT'S OVER HILLS WERE NINETY SIX AND HE TURNED UP A LOT THOSE SHOWS
WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM HE DOES NOW IS MUSIC IN SO SO IT'S I DON'T THINK THIS IS LIKE A THROWAWAY COMMENT MANCHESTER IS IS PRETTY MORE VIBRANT NOW THAN IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO THAT I THINK THIS WAS MORE VENUES IN MANCHESTER'S THIRTY VENUES IN THE CITY CENTRE NOW FOR THERE ARE THE BIG NAME BUT THERE ARE BIG LANES ANYWHERE I DON'T THINK MUSIC HAS BIG GENERATIONAL ZEITGEIST BANDS ANY MORE MUSIC SPRINTER TO MICRO SCENES
THAT'S NOT SAYING THE MAN SHE'S GOT LOADS OF GREAT YOUNG BANDS IT IS A BAND CALLED CABBAGE WERE GREAT COMING UP NOW BUNK ON THE BLINDERS EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD KIDS FANTASTIC BUNKER ALL GREAT FROM THIS MOTOR GREAT MALONE FROM QI MELANIE IS GETTING LIKE YOU KNOW TEN MILLION HITS ON YOUTUBE ALL THAT KIND GROUND STUFF I'LL THE UNDERGROUND STUFF IS SORRY SARAH IT'S LIKE TERRY IT'S A VERY VARIED MUSIC SCENE AND THEY ALSO DOMINATED IT BACK AND SEW IT SITTER IN A WAY
I DO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS STRIKING IS THE WORD COMPLACENCY IS REALLY CREPT IN Z. AND EVEN THE TRUTH IS WITH HER OR BANDS OR NOT IN A CITY HAS GOT VERY VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH THE LEADERS OF THAT CITY AS WELL NOT REALLY AND ALSO I'M ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH A PLACE LIKE MANCHESTER WHERE IT GETS A NAME FOR ITS MUSIC C.D.S YOU GET A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING IN IT'S A QUESTION IT'S YOU GET SOME LIKE THE MANCHESTER INTERNATIONAL MUSIC FESTIVAL WHERE IS NOT A SINGLE MANCUNIAN ACTUALLY CURATES ANYTHING OR EVEN SITS ON THE BOARD OF THAT PANEL
NOW THINGS LIKE THAT I'D LIKE A MAYOR TO LOOK INTO AS ROUNDED BEARD AND YET HE DOES LIVE IN THE NORTH AND HE UNDERSTANDS PAINFUL LIFE IN THE NORTH TOO BUT THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE HE'S AN EVERTON FAN THERE IS A CODED ATTACK HERE IS THERE A TRUTH BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT JOHN ROB ARE RUNNING FOR THEIR BOW TO COS HE WAS BORN IN ANFIELD AND HE'S AN EVERTON FAN NOT A LIVEABLE FOR US TO THINK
BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HOW MANCHESTER IS AN INTERNATIONAL CITY NOW MANCHESTER KID COULD TAKE LIKE YOU KNOW THE WAY LONDON COULD SAY PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD DOING STUFF IT EVEN TABLES A A BIG MAC AT THAT I THINK SO I LIKE MANCHESTER VERY BROADMINDED CITY TONY WELL SO WE SAID MANCHESTER'S A CITY OF IMMIGRANTS THAT'S WHAT MADE HER GREAT CITIES SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME FROM LIVERPOOL AS IMMIGRANTS IT'S YOU PUNKIN IN TERMS IS IT IS A BIG JOB
BUT IF YOU COULD SAY THAT AND I THINK IF HE DOES KIND OF PRACTICAL THINGS ON THE MUSIC FRONT IF HE COMES IN AND HE GETS A NIGHT ZARLAK MUSIC VENUE TRUSTS HAVE GOT A STUDY CARDS DOING ON THAT THAT'S A GREAT IDEA TO LOOK AFTER THE VENUES IF YOU MAKE SURE THE SPACE TO REHEARSE AND STUFF LIKE THAT PEOPLE COULD BE CREATIVE IN THE CITIES ARE MAYOR CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO THOSE KINDA LEVELS NOT CREATIVE LEVELS THOUGH TERRY
I'M STILL A BIT CYNICAL ABOUT IT IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM BEING FROM MERSEYSIDE IT'S JUST THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU LACK THE CHARISMA TO ACTUALLY WIN THE LABOUR PARTY LEADERSHIP FROM SOMEONE LIKE JEREMY CORBIN THEN WE'RE IN TROUBLE AND I THINK MANCHESTER DESERVES SOMEONE WITH A BIT MORE OOMPH ABOUT THEM AT ALL YOUR BUMPH GET GIVE US A COUPLE HAVE YOU GIVEN HER SOME BANDS PEOPLE SHOULD LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO CHOOSE ONE BAND THAT SOMEONE COULD DOWNLOAD NOW OR LISTENS TO GET THAT NEW MANCHESTER SCENE WHAT WOULD YOU CABBAGE

GREEK OFFICIALS HAVE THE PLAY MADE TWO SHARP TURNS BEFORE PLUMMETING THOUSANDS OF FEET MIGHT VIVIAN WHO'S A FORMER HEAD OF OPERATIONS AT THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY SAYS THAT SUGGEST THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A BOMB
