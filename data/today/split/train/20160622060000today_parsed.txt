AND THE T.U.C. IS FRANCES O'GRADY WHO ALSO WANTS TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. WAS SCEPTICAL THAT LEAVING WOULD BRING NET MIGRATION DOWN I THINK BELIEVE CAMPAIGN OR SEVEN PEOPLE A BIG CALL

NEW RESEARCH SEEN BY THE B. B. C. SUGGESTS POLLUTION FROM MANY POPULAR DIESEL CARS IS MUCH WORSE WHEN AIR TEMPERATURES DROP BELOW EIGHTEEN CELSIUS IS THOUGHT POLLUTION CONTROL SOFTWARE FITTED IN MILLIONS OF VEHICLES IS TURNED OFF FOR MOST OF THE YEAR IN THE U.K. BECAUSE OF THE COOL WEATHER HERE THE SOCIETY OF MOTOR MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS SAYS NO CAR COMPANY IS BREAKING THE RULES IS OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT RICHARD WESTCOTT
EMISSIONS ANALYTICS DATA SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN POLLUTION LEVELS FROM A WIDER RANGE OF DIESEL CARS WHEN IT'S EIGHTEEN DEGREES OR LOWER OUTSIDE THAT WAS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DAYS IN THE U.K. LAST YEAR EUROPEAN REGULATIONS ALLOW MANUFACTURERS TO INCREASE THEIR EMISSIONS AT CERTAIN TEMPERATURES IF IT'S TO PROTECT THE ENGINE BUT SOME SUSPECT COMPANIES ARE USING THE EXEMPTION WHEN THEY DON'T REALLY NEED TO BECAUSE THEY CAN GET MORE MILES PER GALLON FROM THEIR CAR

SAYS MUST CANNON BELIEVES HE'LL WIN AND WILL BE BOOSTED BY A LETTER TO THE TIMES SIGNED BY MORE THAN A THOUSAND BUSINESS LEADER SAME BREAKS IT WOULD LEAD TO ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WOULD PUT JOBS AT RISK
THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD THE F. T. HE WAS DISAPPOINTED THEY DISAPPOINTED THAT MORE COMPANIES ARE NOT COME FORWARD IT CAN SOMETIMES BE FRUSTRATING THAT ORGANISATIONS FEEL CONSTRAINED AND SAY THEY CAN'T TAKE SIDES OR PUT THEIR HEADS ABOVE THE PARAPET AND THAT LETTER IN THE TIMES IS THERE
MAIN STORY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE BUSINESS LEADERS TOGETHER EMPLOYING ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION PEOPLE INCLUDING MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED FIRMS THE TIMES ALL OF THEM SIGNING THAT LETTER THE TIME SAYING THAT BREAKS IT WOULD DAMAGE THE BRITISH ECONOMY ALL OF THE PAPERS WELL EXCEPT FOR THE MALE LEAD WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION A REFERENDUM ON THE GUARDIAN SAYS DAVID CAMERON WAS ACCUSED CAMPAIGNERS HAVE STOKING INTOLERANCE
AND DIVISION WITH EXTREME WARNINGS ON IMMIGRATION AND SAID BRITAIN WILL BE SEEN AS A MORE NARROW INSULAR AND INWARD LOOKING COUNTRY IF IT WANTS TO BE HE'S DONE INTO THROUGH THE GUARDIAN HE SAID ALL SIDES OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAD BECOME VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON IMMIGRATION AND THE DECISION WOULD CARRY CONSEQUENCES THE TELEGRAPH A STORY ABOUT MICHAEL GO ONE OF THE LEADERS
OF THE OUTERS IT SAYS THAT ECONOMIC EXPERTS WHO DISMISS BRITAIN'S CHANCES OF SUCCESS OUTSIDE THE E.U. ALIKE NAZI PROPAGANDISTS IN THE PAY OF THE GOVERNMENT QUOTING MICHAEL GIRLS HE WARNED VOTERS NOT TO BE INFLUENCED BY ECONOMISTS AND BIG BUSINESS LEADERS WHO ARE FORECAST DIRE CONSEQUENCES IN THE EVENT OF A BRICK
QUITE A FEW OF THE PAPER'S QUITE PROMINENTLY HAVE THE AWFUL NEWS ABOUT ELLIE BUTLER AND A FATHER WHO MURDERED HER AND WAS SENT TO PRISON YESTERDAY AT LEAST TWENTY THREE YEARS THE SIX YEAR OLD
THE TIME SAYS ON ITS FRONT PAGE WAS MURDERED BY HER ABUSIVE AND SADISTIC FATHER AFTER A JUDGE'S RULING GAVE HIM THE POWER TO FEND OFF THE POLICE THE DOCTORS TEACHERS AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND WE'LL BE TALKING LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME TO ELLIE'S GRANDFATHER
WELL IT'S ALMOST OVER TODAY THE FINAL DAY OF THE CAMPAIGNING BEFORE VOTERS GO TO THE POLLS TO DECIDE IF WE SHOULD STAY IN ALL DAY EVEN LAST NIGHT WAS THE BIG TELLY THEY'D TOLD THE GRAND THE BAITERS THE B. B. C. MODESTLY CALLED IT IN THE WEMBLEY ARENA SIX POLITICIANS THREE FROM EACH SIDE OF THE CAMPAIGN MAKING THEIR CASE IN FRONT OF SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE THE DEBATE COVERED THREE THEMES THE ECONOMY IMMIGRATION AND BRITAIN'S ROLE IN THE WORLD BELIEVE CAMPAIGNER ANDREA LEAD SUMMER SAID THE U.K. DOESN'T NEED TO BE IN THE SINGLE MARKET TO TRADE WITH THE REST OF EUROPE
TRADE DEALS ARE MANY OF MOST OF THEM FORTY SIX OF THE FIFTY COUNTRIES ARE NOT IN THE SINGLE MARKET MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD DO MORE BUSINESS WITH THE E.U. THAN THE U.K. DOES YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE IN THE SINGLE MARKET
BUT SIDIQUE KHAN THE MO LONDON COURSE REMAIN CAMPAIGNER SAID IT'S BRITAIN'S SIDE USE THAT GIVES IT POWER THE BIGGER YOU ARE THE MORE CLOUT YOU'VE GOT THE IDEA SMALLER COUNTRIES CAN NEGOTIATE BETTER DEALS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS RUBBISH AND YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY WE GET GOOD DEALS BECAUSE IF YOU ARE
YOU'RE A COMPANY IN CHINA
IN AMERICA IN INDIA AND YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH FIVE HUNDRED MILLION CUSTOMERS YOU COULD HAVE YOUR CALL HAIR IN LONDON HAVE A GATEWAY TO FIFA ME CUSTOMERS WHEN THE DEBATE MOVED TO IMMIGRATION SAID HE CAN'T DESCRIBE BOAT LEAVES FOCUS AS PROJECT HATE
THE PROBLEMS IF YOU MIGHT START OFF WITH POD I CHOOSE WONDERFUL IMMIGRATION IS BUT YOUR CAMPAIGN HASN'T BEEN PROJECT
IT'S BEEN PROJECT HATE AS FAR AS THEY WERE
AND TO THAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGNER GEEZER LA STUART POINTED OUT THAT SHE HERSELF HAD EMIGRATED FROM GERMANY I AM AN IMMIGRANT I'M ALSO A MOTHER AND A GRANDMOTHER AND I THINK IT IS HIM
AS WE PLAN FOR OUR PUBLIC SERVICES LIFE N.H.S. LIKE THE SCHOOLS LIKE HOUSING
THE YOU CAN PLAN AHEAD PROPERLY
WE HAVE UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION WITH THE BEST WILL OFF THE WORLD WE WILL HAVE SITUATIONS LIKE IN THE WEST MIDLANDS WHERE THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND PRIMARY SCHOOL PLACE IS MISSING
WHERE THE DEBATE MOVED TO BRITAIN'S INDEPENDENT OF THE FORMER MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON SAID THE COUNTRY HAD LOST SOVEREIGNTY BECAUSE ITS COURTS CAN BE OVERRULED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE THE BEST PLACE FOR US IS TO BE OUT OF THIS
THIS SUPREME LEGALS IS LIKE A PRINCE IF HE CAN'T HE'S COMPLETELY WRONG THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IS THE SUPREME LEGAL AUTHORITY
THE OTHER SIDE RUTH DAVIDSON SAID SHE IS PERSUADED BY THE NUMBER OF EXPERTS WHO ARGUE THAT THE U.K. WOULD BE SAFER IN THE E.U.
WHEN THE HEAD OF G.C.H.Q. SAYS WERE SAFER IN THE E.U. I LISTEN WHEN FIVE FORMER NATAL CHEESE SO YOU WERE SAFER IN THE E.U. I WAS WHEN THE HEAD OF EUROPE ALL HE'S A BRIT SETS WERE SAFER IN THE E.U.
SIX SIX
WELL WE'LL HEAR FROM BOTH CAMPAIGNS OF COURSE IN THE COURSE OF THIS PROGRAMME I'LL BE TALK OF THE MAN WHO CALLED THE REFERENDUM DAVID CAMERON AT TEN PAST EIGHT TONNER THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX VOLKSWAGEN THE GERMAN COMIC AT THE CHEATED IN HER MISSIONS TESTS HAS A BIT OF A SHOWDOWN TODAY A SHOWDOWN WITH ITS OWN SHAREHOLDERS DOMINIC IS HERE WITH THAT AND THE REST BUSINESS HE'S WONDERFUL YOU CAN CERTAINLY DOES JUSTIN YES YOU'LL REMEMBER THE VOLKSWAGEN SCANDAL THE COMPANY INSTALLED SOFTWARE
IN A LIVE A MILLION DIESEL ENGINES WORLDWIDE THAT LET THOSE ENGINES CHEAT EMISSIONS TIS YOUR FEAR COS THE COMPANY AND SIMPLEST HAS BILLIONS OF POUNDS AND TODAY THERE'S A BLISTERS GET THE CHANCE TO GRILL THE MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING AND HANOVER
I'M JOINED FROM HAD EVER BUY ONE OF THOSE UNHAPPY SHAREHOLDERS DOCTOR HANS CHRISTOPH AVERT WHO'S CO HIT OF STEWARDSHIP AT HERMES YES THE BIG FUND MANAGEMENT ADVISORY SERVICE HE IS PLANNING TO VOICES CONCERNS AT TODAY'S MEETING HANS CREASED OFF MANY PEOPLE I THINK MIGHT VIEW THIS ISSUE AS AN ISOLATED PIECE OF WRONGDOING BY MANAGERS OR PERHAPS A TECHNICAL ISSUE BUT YOU ACTUALLY THINK THE PROBLEM RUNS MUCH STEEPER THAN THAT DON'T YOU HE GOES BACK TO HOW V.W. WAS OWNED AND CONTROLLED
CERTAINLY IN GERMANY ELEVEN MILLION CAST AFFECTED FOUR BILLION LOST SIXTEEN BILLION PROVISIONS
MASSIVE SHARE PRICE JOB BUT NO ONE IS REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE UNDERLYING
FUNDAMENTAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROBLEMS AT FOX WHICH REALLY STARTED TO SUPERVISE HE BOARD AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES WE WANT WOOD
FIRMLY ON THE AGENDA TODAY AND ASKING FOR CHAINS AND MAKING SOME PRACTICAL SUGGESTION WHAT COULD CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT VOLKSWAGEN IS NOT LIKE OTHER COMPANIES AS THAT VISIT IT COMPANY QUOTED IN LONDON ALL SHAREHOLDERS NORMALLY EQUAL IT'S ONE MEMBER ONE VOTE THAT'S NOT THE CASE OF VOLKSWAGEN IS
THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INDEED THE VAULTING A MOTH OF FAMILIES THEIR EXEL ECONOMIC INTERESTS FOR EXAMPLE HE PORSCHE HE FAMILIES OR CONTROL MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OFF THE WARDS
I JUST HAVE AROUND THIRTY PERCENT OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE COMPANY AND THAT'S A RESIDE OFF THESE SO CALLED PREFERENCE OR YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE WARD BUT JUST AND AN ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE COMPANY WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO SAY TODAY'S A.G.M.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE BELIEVE IT'S WRONG IT'S A SUPERVISORY BOARD AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARDS WE HERE WE HAVE THE BOARD CONSISTS OF TWENTY MEMBERS TURN UP THEY'RE MY EMPLOY REPRESENTATIVES THAT'S HIGHEST FAMILY MEMBERS
AND FORMED PORTION PEWTER FAMILIES TO POLITICIANS FROM THE LAND OF LOWER SAXONY YOUR AUNT HANNAH FACTORIES IN THERE TWO REPRESENTATIVES OF SCIENCE WE THINK THEY'RE SELECT A COMPETENCE GONNA SELECT EXPERIENCED IN THE IMPORTANT AREA FOR FORKS FOR EXAMPLE ARE TRYING TO TO HAVE DRY STICKS KNOWLEDGE BATTERIES DIGITISATION
ALSO FINGERS QUITE SIMPLY ELEK OFF ANY REALLY INDEPENDENCE AND SOME SOME CAN'T I WAIT WITH A STRONG INFLUENCE OFF OF THE FAMILY INTERSTATE ON US THE OTHER THE OTHER POINT OF VIEW OF COURSE IS THAT IT'S THIS KIND OF ODD GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ONE THAT
REALLY IMMUNE FROM THE FORCES OF MARKET THAT HAS ALLOWED BIG GERMAN COMPANIES LIKE VOLKSWAGEN TO DO SO WELL THEY CAN TAKE A VERY LONG TERM VIEW AND AFTER ALL VOLKSWAGEN HAS IF NOT THE BIGGEST IN THE FIRST OR SECOND BIGGEST CAR MAKER IN THE WORLD
THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN SHE JUST ACTUALLY OVERTAKEN TERMS OF HOMINY CAST WE OUGHTA LAST YEAR BEFORE THIS OIL AT THE FOX HUNT ALSO HAS PROBLEMS AND FOR EXAMPLE IN A COMPETITIVE AND EFFICIENCY BUT ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE ARE SOME GERMAN COMPANIES SAW EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT B.M.W. FAMILY ON AND THEY DON'T HAVE QUIETLY IN THE GOVERNANCE PROBLEMS FOX HAS HAD FOR MANY YEARS AND BUTTERY REALLY SAYING TO A FOX
THE WAY BETWEEN IF YOU LIKE O.K. A CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISPERSE SHAREHOLDING ON A STRUCTURE END INTO MORDOR FOX I'M CURRENTLY HAS MUCH BETTER AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE LONGTEMPS CALLERS OR STAY CALL US AND MORE AND JUST BRIEFLY HANS CHRISTOPH WHAT CHANCES OF ANY REAL CHANGE TODAY
IS SOME THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US AND OTHER INVESTORS WOULD BE DIRECTLY
WITH A BOARD MEMBER WOULD ON US BUT ALSO TO THE FAMILIES DIRECTLY AND OF COURSE
OXFORD MAY WHEN TO COME BACK TO THE MARKETS HAVE JUST PRESENTED AN AMBITIOUS NEW STRATEGY
THIS ALL THE LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS AND SCIENCE AT HER LIKE YOU TWO TO COME UP IN ME WHEN YOU TWO COME BACK TO MARKETS AND THEY REALLY NEED TO PRESENT A MORE CONVINCING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT THEY NEED TO KEEP PEOPLE LIKE YOU ON SIDE THANK YOU VERY MUCH HANS CHRISTOPH VERT OF HERMES WHO JOINED US FROM HANOVER
THE BIG STORY YESTERDAY AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE CHAIN MY LOCAL IS HEADING FOR ADMINISTRATION THE RETAILER BRIEF STAFF YESTERDAY THAT THE BUSINESS HAS MADE THE FIRST OFFICIAL STEP TOWARDS A POINTY ADMINISTRATOR AND THAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FORTNIGHT OR SO THE CHAIN WHICH USED TO BE AND BUY MORRISON'S HAS AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY STORES AND OPPOSE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND STAFF TO EXAMINE WHAT WENT WRONG
I'M JOINED BY BRIAN ROBERTS WHO'S DIRECTOR AT THE RETAIL CONSULTANCY T. C. C. GLOBAL BRIAN THIS HAS BEEN A VERY BRIEF AFFAIR HAS AN UP MORRISON'S ONLY SOLD THE COMPANY TO ITS CURRENT OWNERS LAST AUGUST I THINK THAT THAT VERY SORT OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SHORT LIFESPAN IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS BUILT ON FOUNDATIONS OF SANDY AT MORRISONS RUNNER A HUGE HURRY TO DO TWO THINGS UNDER PREVIOUS DALTON PHILLIPS ONE WAS TO CREATE AN ONLINE BUSINESS
IT'S A FAIRLY STANDARD PART OF THE SUPERMARKET OFFERING THEY DID THAT WITH A VERY GENEROUS ARRANGEMENT WITH THEM OCADO AND THE OTHER REQUIREMENT WAS TO BUILD A CONVENIENCE BUSINESS WHICH IS ALWAYS SEEN AS A VERY FAST GROWING PART OF THE GROCERY MARKET AND THEY WERE A LONG WAY BEHIND THE LIKES OF TESCO ALL OVER SORT OF NETWORK MARIA TWO THOUSAND STORES NOW LET'S START FROM SCRATCH AND I THINK BECAUSE THAT MISTAKE ON A LOT OF THOSE SORT OF BETTER SITES FOR CONVENIENCE STORES ARE A BIG HURRY SO THEY WERE RUNNING AROUND THE COUNTRY BUYING UP
SITES FOR THE LIKES JESSUP'S BLOCKBUSTER H. M. PIECE A LOT OF UNWANTED NON FOOD STORES WHICH OBVIOUSLY DON'T MAKE A GREAT FOUNDATION FOR CONVENIENCE BUSINESS SO IT WAS ALL DOWN TO THAT OLD THING ABOUT PROPERTY IT WAS ALL DOWN TO LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION A HUGE CLICHE BUT ONE THAT IS IS A CLICHE FOR A REASON IT'S SO SO IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN CONVENIENCE RETAILING SO JUST BEING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD CAN BE FATAL JUST BEING LIKE FIFTY YARDS TOO FAR AWAY FROM SCHOOL OR A HOSPITAL ROBUST STOP CAN BE FATAL TAKE THE LIKES OF SAINSBURY'S AND TESCO
HAVE YOU MET LARGE TEAMS AND THEY APPLY A LOT OF SCIENCE AND REGRET WHERE THEY PUT THE STORE'S MORRISONS AND DID NOT DO THAT SO WHEN IT CAME TO PASS THAT IT IT CHANGED HANDS LAST YEAR AND BECAME MY LOCAL
YET A FAIR DEGREE OF CONCERN TO THE STORES JUST WEREN'T RIGHT THERE WAS SOME OPTIMISM HOWEVER BECAUSE MY LOCAL I WAS ABLE TO DO WAS TAKE AWAY LOTS OF HEAD OFFICE COST ALSO TAKE AWAY LOTS OF DISTRIBUTION COSTS BY USING THE WHOLESALER RATHER THAN THEIR OWN DISTRIBUTION NETWORK SO THAT THAT WAS IT IT WAS KIND OF FIFTY FIFTY FROM THE START IF THIS COMPANY DOES GOING TO MINISTRY IS STILL AN F. DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE OF FINDING A BUYER
I THINK THAT WE'VE HAD MORRISONS HAVE A GO AND I'M NOT NOT REALLY SUCCEED TO BE PAYS THAT MIGRAINE AND HIS TEAM BACK BY GRATEFUL CAPITAL HAVEN'T REALLY SUCCEED WITH THIS BUSINESS SO I STRUGGLE TO SEE ANYONE NOT EVEN NOT EVEN MIKE ASHLEY RIDING OVER THE HILL FROM SPORTS DIRECT TO BUY COUPLE LOST BUY THINGS AT THE MOMENT DOESN'T IT I THINK IF WE LOOK AT THAT SOME OF THE THE LIKELY SUSPECTS IT WOULD BE THE BIG RACES AND I THINK THAT THEY'VE ALL PASSED OVER THE EAST STOWE AND STOOLS IN THE PAST
IT'S UNLIKELY WE'RE GOING TO IT'S GOING TO EXIST AND IN ITS CURRENT FORM WHICH IS A GREAT SHAME IT WAS A COURAGEOUS ATTEMPT TO CREATE OR SUSTAIN A CONVENIENCE BUSINESS BUT IT'S REALLY HASN'T PROVED TO BE THAT EASY AS QUICKLY IS A SIMPLE SYMPTOMATIC OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAT'S GOING ON AND ME TROUBLE HEAD V.H.S. AUSTIN REED
PRETTY TOUGH FOR THESE BRICKS AND MORTAR RETAILERS ISN'T AT THE MOMENT I THINK THAT FOOD IS AS AS JEREMY BENT SLIGHTLY EASIER THAN NON FOOD AT THE MOMENT YOU LIKES OF B.H.S. JUST REFLECT THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED IN TERMS OF ONLINE IN TERMS OF COMPETITION THE GROCERIES HUGELY HUGELY COMPETITIVE BUT I THINK ON THIS OCCASION THAT ALL THIS IS SYMPTOMATIC OF IS THE FACT THAT YOU NEED THE STALLS IN THE RIGHT PLACES TO ATTRACT THE RIGHT NUMBER OF SHOPPERS AND SADLY THIS WASN'T THE CASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRIAN ROBERTS OF T. C. C. GLOBAL
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MARCUS NOW WE'RE JOINED FROM EDINBURGH BY RICHARD DUNBAR INVESTMENT RATE FOR ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT RICHARD THAT MY LOCAL STORY IS CERTAINLY A TALE OF THE TIMES IT'S TOUGHER RETAILERS ISN'T IT WOULD YOU WOULD YOU BE RUSHING TO BUY ANY SHARES IN ANY OF THE LARGE QUOTED TO GROSS IS AT THE MINUTE
WELL THIS WAS A BIGGER SUPERMARKETS ARE STARTING TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER WAS PARTICULARLY TESCO IT'S PARTLY WHY I THINK I'M LOCAL IS STRUGGLING AND HAS STRUGGLED AND COMETS ARE GOLDIE AND RETAIL CONTINUE OUR OLD IN LITTLE CONTINUED TO PROSPER IN THAT MARKET BUT RETAIL RETAIL AND GENERALLY THEY'RE ALWAYS WINNERS AND LOSERS FOR EVERY B.H.S. AROUND LOCAL THERE'S
PRE MARKER AND H. AND AMIRAH NEXT YEAR THERE'S ALWAYS DEMAND OF COMETS OF THE RIGHT PRODUCT AT THE RIGHT PLACE AND THOSE WHO FEEL GENERALLY FEEL ON ON ONE OR BOTH OF THESE TESTS SO THERE'S ALWAYS MONEY TO MADE ON THE HIGH STREET AND THOSE WHO DO IT WELL
IT WAS THE EASIEST TODAY ALSO FROM A COMPANY VERY CLOSE TO WHERE YOU ARE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND MORE JOB LOSSES IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY FAMILIAR TAYLOR OBVIOUS ISN'T IT A STEADY TRICKLE OF OF OF SLIMMING DOWN JOB LOSSES AND WELL THE GOVERNMENT HOPES EVENTUALLY RETURN TO MARKET
IT IS IT'S NOT A SURPRISE I'LL BE B'S B'S HAS BEEN ASKED TO ANNA SEEKING TO BECOME A SMALLER SAFER MORE PROFITABLE BUYING CAN AND INEVITABLE PRODUCT OF THAT IAN HAS A SMALLER WORKFORCE AND TO PUT IN CONTEXT THE WORKFORCE IS HALVED FROM ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND AT ITS PEAK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND PART OF THAT STRATEGY THIS YEAR TO CUT COSTS BY ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS AND THE STEP WE SAW YESTERDAY WAS ANOTHER ONE
ON THAT LONG ROAD BACK TO PROFITABILITY BUT I THINK ARE NECESSARY ONE AND ONE BEING IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY ORBIT PAINFULLY BY ROSS MCEWAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND HIS TEAM THERE WHAT CHANCES RICHARD DO YOU THINK OF ANY EARLY SALE OF SHARES BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND
BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS OF A RETURN TO PROFITABILITY AND THAT AIM OF BECOMING SMALLER SAFER AND MORE PROFITABLE HAS TAKEN LONGER THAN I THINK ANYONE THOUGHT IN WHEN WE LOOKED AT IT AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND
I IT A BIT BUT THE COMPANY IS GETTING THERE THEY'RE REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE BALANCE SHEET THERE ARE GRADUALLY WORKING THROUGH THEIR MANY LIABILITIES THAT THEY'VE HAD TO COPE WITH PARTICULARLY LEGAL LIABILITIES AND THEY'RE CLEANING UP SOME OF THE BAD THAT SOME POOR LOANS THAT THEY MADE IN THERE
AND WHAT WAS SEEN AS BETTER TIMES SO THEY ARE GETTING THERE IT'S TAKEN LONGER THAN EXPECTED BUT I THINK THE LIGHT IS AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THE LAST FEW SETS HER RESULTS AND HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT SETS ARE COMING IN THE COMING QUARTERS WE'LL SEE MORE OF THAT AND RICHARD THERE WAS ANOTHER BIG FALL YESTERDAY KIM RING THE FOOTSIE TOO FIFTY COMPANY THAT MAKES DEFENCE EQUIPMENT
THERE WAS A PROPHET'S WARNING THE SHARES FELL THIRTY FIVE PER CENT AND THEY'D ALREADY FALLEN FORTY PER CENT FOR A SIMILAR WARNING BECKON OCTOBER THERE'S A SYMBOL HERE LEAVING ASIDE THE PROBLEMS THAT CAME RING MIGHT HAVE IT'S A SYMPTOM REALLY OF HOW NERVY AND VOLATILE MARKET SIRE ISN'T IT
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON THE KIA CAMERON WERE A VICTIM OF A LOW OIL PRICE SOME OF THEIR DEFENCE CUSTOMERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST YOU FIND THAT ON HELPFUL AND REDUCE THEIR ORDERS ON THE BACK ARE THEY HAVE A LITTLE TOO MUCH DEBT AS WELL WHICH IS UNHELPFUL AND THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO IS PARTICULARLY UNHELPFUL BUT WHAT'S THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS PICKING UP GROWTH IS STILL PRETTY AMY MAKES SO MANY COMPANIES ARE FISHING IN A SLIGHTLY SHALLOWER SEALS POOL
AND THEN THEY WOULD NORMALLY DO AT THIS POINT IN THE CYCLE AND THEREFORE PROFITABILITY IS HARDER TO COME BY AND WE'RE SEEING THAT WITH SOME COMPANIES WITH THE LOWER SALES GROWTH AS WE CAN TO LURE PROFITABILITY AND UNPLEASANT SURPRISES TO INVESTORS IN SOME INSTANCES YES IT IS IT'S TOUGH OUT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH RICHARD DUMBO DIRECTOR AT ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT

LOSS OF ENERGY ON ALL SIDES AND OTHER PEOPLE JUST THINK LET'S JUST DO IT LET'S JUST GET IT OVER WITH AND THAT SEEMED TO ME TO BE WHAT WE LEARNED FROM LAST NIGHT SORT OF BIG TELEVISION DEBATE THERE WAS FURY THERE WAS ANGER THERE WAS PASSION BUT DID WE LEARN ANYTHING NEW
KIND OF SUSPECT NOT THEY WERE FAMILIAR ARGUMENTS FAMILIAR SLOGANS ARRIVAL SIDES ALL VERY WELL DRILLED COMING OUT WITH THEIR PARTICULAR LINE SO THE LEAVES SIDE STRESSING TAKE BACK CONTROL THERE REMAIN SIDE SAYING DON'T TAKE THE RISK
I THOUGHT THERE WERE JUST A FEW SORT OF THE NETS IN THERE THERE WHICH KIND OF GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT INTO SOME OF THE SORT OF TRUTH OF THIS CAMPAIGN ONE IS I THINK THE LEE SIDE FRANKIE WOULD HAVE STRUGGLED WITHOUT BORIS JOHNSON HE GIVES THEM A PERSONALITY A PROFILE A PRESENCE AND THAT
THAT DRIVES THEM ON AND HE UNDOUBTEDLY RECEIVED SORT OF THE BIG RHETORICAL MOMENT LAST NIGHT WHEN HE SAID TOMORROW BE INDEPENDENT STAY I THINK TO THE ONLY KIND OF CLEAR HIT I SAW LAST NIGHT DIDN'T REALLY GET MUCH TRACTION WAS WHEN FRANCES O'GRADY THE LEADER OF THE T.U.C. CHALLENGED THE
BRECHT'S OR TEARS WOULD YOU ACTUALLY CUT IMMIGRATION SORT OF SHUFFLE AROUND AND ALL LOOKED A BIT AWKWARD AND YOU KNOW THAT POINTS TO WHAT HAS BEEN I THINK A CONSCIOUS AMBIGUITY IN THE LEAGUE SIDE THAT YES THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT TAKING BACK CONTROL OVER IMMIGRATION THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOT COMMITTED TO A TARGET OR TIMETABLE FOR REDUCING IMMIGRATION AND THE LAST THING JOHN WHICH I JUST OBSERVE I THINK THE REMAINS MUST BE KICKING THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAVE NOT MADE GREATER USE
OF RUTH DAVIDSON WHO PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU SHOOT IT JUST REMINDED ME OF NICOLA STURGEON THE GENERAL ELECTION ANOTHER TOUGH SCOTTISH COOKIE DOMINATING THE PLATFORM READY TO GO TOE TO TOE WITH HER CONSERVATIVE OPPONENTS AND IF I WAS BORIS JOHNSON I WOULDN'T BE SO WORRIED ABOUT GEORGE OSBORNE OR ANY OF THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS
POSITIONING THEMSELVES TO TAKE OVER AS LEADER I WOULD BE LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER AT THE CLUTCH OF FORMIDABLE TORY WOMEN WHO'VE EMERGED IN THIS CONTEST NOT JUST RUTH DAVIDSON BUT AMBER RUDD ANDREA LEAD SOME I'D BE MORE WORRIED ABOUT THEM I THINK THEY'RE ALL THERE JUST A FINAL THOUGHT OF ABOVE
THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE HEARD IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE DEBATE INDEED FOR A LONG WAY THROUGH THE THE CAMPAIGN THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T BEING TOLD THE FACTS THEY WEREN'T BEING GIVEN THE TRUTH THEY WEREN'T DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT EXCELLENT THAT SEEMS TO MEET HAVE FADED AWAY A BIT BECAUSE NOBODY COULD ARCHY IS THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD ALL THEY NEED TO KNOW COULD THEY I MEAN
I KIND OF THINK YES OR NO JOHN I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TRIED ENDLESSLY TO SET OUT THE FACTS BUT THE DIFFICULTY IS THERE A FAX AND THERE ARE FACTS AND WE'RE ALSO ON SET THE FACTS THE OTHER SIDE PUT ANOTHER SET OF BIKES AND STRUCK ME LAST NIGHT HERE WE ARE AT THE END OF
MONTHS OF ARGEE BARGEE AND STILL THE FACTS WERE IN DISPUTE SO WE HAVE ANDREA LEAD SOME SAYING SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR LAWS COME FROM BRUSSELS RUTH DAVIS AND SAYS NO NOT TRUE IT'S ONLY THIRTEEN PER CENT SO EVEN AFTER ALL THE ARGUMENTS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IT SEEMS TO ME THE FACTS
ALMOST REMAIN AS ELUSIVE AS THEY WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COMPASS NORMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN MILLIONS OF DIESEL CARS COULD BE SPEWING OUT MORE POLLUTION THAN WE THOUGHT IT'S TO DO WITH THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE WISH RICHARD WESCOTT IS OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT BETTER EXPLAIN TO US WHAT AT LEAST IT'S CLAIMED IS HAPPENING WERE BASICALLY WE SPOKE TO THE BIGGEST COMMISSIONS TESTING COMPANY IN THE COUNTRY THEY TEST CARS AS THEY DRIVE AROUND ON THE ROAD SO THEY'VE GONE BACK OVER THEIR DATA SO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CARS THIRTY MANUFACTURERS
AND THEY'VE LOOKED AT THAT THE SLIGHTLY OLDER VERSION OF DIESELS ARE STILL ON SALE NOW UNTIL AUGUST I HAD TO PASS ON THE EURO FIVE OMISSIONS TEST AND BASICALLY IF YOU TAKE THE AVERAGES AS A WHOLE THEY ARE JUST SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POLLUTING WHEN IT'S LESS THAN EIGHTEEN DEGREES OUTSIDE THAN WHEN IT'S MORE THAN EIGHTEEN DEGREES OUTSIDE AND WE ALL KNOW BRITAIN'S NOT THE HOTTEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IT WAS EIGHTEEN DEGREES FOR FIFTY DAYS LAST YEAR AND THE REASON FOR THAT
IS THE MISSION SYSTEMS THEY USE START PARTLY TURNING THEMSELVES OFF WHEN IT GETS A LITTLE BIT COLDER AT THE CAR COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO DO IT BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THE ENGINE AND ENGINEERS TO SAY THAT THE WEATHER CAN AFFECT THESE ENGINE PARTS SO IT'S ALL WITHIN THE RULES BUT THE SUSPICION IS THAT SOME CAR COMPANIES MIGHT BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS RULE TO START PARTLY SWITCHING OFF THE OMISSION SISTERS WERE WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO DO THAT
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET A BETTER MILES PER GALLON AND IS ANY ACTION OR CAN ANY ACTION BE TAKEN BECAUSE AS YOU SAY THESE ARE THESE ARE CARS THEY'RE ALREADY BEEN SOLD
THIS BACKS UP BASICALLY TESTING THAT'S HAPPENED IN GERMANY AND BRITAIN AND FRANCE BY THE GOVERNMENT'S THEY SIMILARLY FOUND WHEN IT WAS COLDER YOU'VE GOT MORE EMISSIONS HAD SOMETHING WITH THE OLDER CARS AND THERE ARE SOME CAST SOFTWARE SYSTEMS THAT ARE BEING CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE TESTS IN GERMANY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND CARS ACROSS EUROPE BUT THE REALITY IS NO ONE'S BROKEN ANY RULES THE CAR COMPANIES INSIST THAT THIS IS TO PROTECT THE ENGINE OTHERWISE PEOPLE'S CARS WOULD START BREAKING DOWN WELL THAT'S NO GOOD EITHER
MOVING ON TO THE NEW SETS OF CARS WHICH THEY SAY THEY AREN'T AFFECTED BY THE TEMPERATURE SYSTEM SO SUBURBAN EFFECT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND IF NOTHING HAPPENS THE OTHER POINT ABOUT THIS AND YOU'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THIS CLAIM THAT ACTUALLY THE DAMAGE THAT THESE CARS WILL CONTINUE TO DO TO US ALL FOR YEARS TO COME HE'S HOT
YES IF YOU THINK THESE EURO FIVE CATTERY CARS WENT ABOUT TWENTY ELEVEN AS FIVE POINT ONE MILLION OF THEM ON BRITAIN'S ROADS
AND THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL SO UNTIL THE END OF AUGUST AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DRIVING AROUND FOR ANOTHER TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS SO THE REALITY YEARS EVERY WINTER THEORETICALLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MILLIONS MORE CARS
PUTTING OUT MORE POLLUTION ALL PERFECTLY LEGALLY AND THERE'S ACTUALLY NOTHING TO BE DONE ABOUT IT
ON THIS LATER IN THE PROGRAMME RISCA RICHARD WESTCOTT OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT THANK THEM TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SETTLE AND THERE'S A NEW COMPUTER SCAM WE NEED TO BE WARY ABOUT SOMEONE CALLS YOU AND PRETENDS TO BE FROM THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER JANE WAKEFIELD AS A TECHNOLOGY FOR A PORTER AND JANE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT SO THEY ASKED THEY TELL YOU THAT THEY FOUND VIRUSES ON YOUR COMPUTER
AND THAT IF YOU DON'T SORT OF IMMEDIATELY CALLER NUMBER AND ALLOW THEM TO HAVE REMOTE ACCESS TO YOUR MACHINE THEN YOU KNOW EVERYTHING COULD BE WIPED ON YOUR MACHINE SO IT'S QUITE SCARY STUFF THIS SCAM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS IN VARIOUS FORMS WITH COLD CALLING PEOPLE CALLING PEOPLE UP OFTEN ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO
PERHAPS AREN'T VERY TACTIC SAVVY BUT IN RECENT MONTHS THEIR ONE TECH COMPANY ONE SECURITY FIRM IN A TWO HUNDRED PERCENT RISE IN THESE KIND OF COLD CALLS AND THERE'S NOW A NEW METHOD BY WHICH THESE SCAMMERS CAN GET INFORMATION FROM YOU YOU COULD JUST BE BROWSING AS NORMAL AND A LITTLE POP UP WILL APPEAR
ON YOUR COMPUTER WITH A MESSAGE SAYING YOU KNOW WE'VE DETECTED MALICIOUS VIRUSES HERE'S THE NUMBER CALL IT IMMEDIATELY AND JEROME SECURE A CONSULTANT WITH THE SECURITY FIRM MOW WHERE BITES HAS COME ACROSS THE POP UP SCAM RECENTLY
PART OF MY BUSINESS ACTUALLY TO GO TO MALICIOUS SIDES WHEN I SAW THE WARNING FROM WHAT APPEARED TO BE MY SPEEDY I FIGURED THEY MAY HAVE CAUGHT ME DOING SOMETHING BAD BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A SCAMMER IT TOOK ME A MINUTE OR TWO TO REALISE THAT THIS WAS A LEGITIMATE MESSAGE I ACTUALLY CALL THE NUMBER ON THAT PAGE AND I WENT THROUGH THE CLASSIC TEXT SCAN WITH A FIG WHAT AGENT ON THE PHONE
DID IT STING HE SAID THEY WERE I SAW THE WARNING FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE MAYA I S. P. HUH HOW DID THEY FIND OUT WHAT YOUR I ASK PIERS OR APPEAR TO FIND IT UP WELL THIS IS THE SOPHISTICATED BIT SO CRIMINALS ARE TARGETING BIT BIG NETWORKS AND THERE ARE INFECTING ADS WITH US SINGLE PIXEL
THIS PIXEL CAN REDIRECT USERS WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEY CAN BE JUST BROWSING AS NORMAL AND IN THE BACKGROUND THEY ARE TAKING INFORMATION FROM THEIR COMPUTER FINDING OUT THEIR I.P. ADDRESS AND FROM THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO US ASCERTAIN THEIR I S. PIERS I MEAN FOR THE CO CALLING OFTEN IT'S JUST A LUCKY GUESS BUT FOR THIS MORE SOPHISTICATED POP UP SCAM THEY ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO FIND OUT YOUR S. P. AND THEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SEND A POP UP THAT LOOKS AS IF IT'S BRANDED FROM YOUR I.S.P. WHICH IS PARTICULARLY SCARY I THINK FOR PEOPLE
AND I'M GENUINELY CATCHES A MAP YES IT DOES I MEAN IF YOU AS THE GUY IN THE CLIP HE'S BEEN RESEARCHING THIS FOR YEARS SAID HE EVEN HE NEARLY FELL FOR IT SO YOU KNOW IF ER SECURITY EXPERT CAN NEARLY FALL FOR IT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE BE VERY WORRIED AND WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND OF COURSE IF THEY DO CALL THROUGH THIS NUMBER THEY THEY THEN RISKS SOMEBODY OR HAVING ACCESS TO EVERYTHING THAT'S ON THEIR COMPUTER
AND OFTEN IN SOME CASES THEY THEY ASK PEOPLE TO PAY A ONE OFF FEE AS WELL SO THEY'RE SORT OF LOSING MONEY LAST YEAR MICROSOFT SAID THAT OVER THREE BILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. ARE FALLING FOR THIS SCAM AND PAID MORE THAN ONE BILLION POUNDS THREE MILLION PEOPLE YES JAMIE THANK VERY MUCH
TWENTY THREE I HAD TO PICK A PARDON IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SORT THEM LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THEY ARE STRAINING EVERY EDITORIAL SINEW TO PERSUADE US HOW A VOTE TOMORROW THE GUARDIAN LEADS WITH AN INTERVIEW WITH DAVID CAMERON IN WHICH HE ACCUSES LEAD CAMPAIGNERS ARE STOKING INTOLERANCE AND DIVISION HE SAYS BRITAIN IS ARGUABLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MULTI ETHNIC MULTI FAITH OPPORTUNITY DEMOCRACY ANYWHERE ON EARTH AND IMMIGRATION HAS TO BE DEBATED WITH CARE
IN THE SAME PAPER THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER MATILDA N.Z. RIGHT IT WOULDN'T BE A DISASTER A TRAGEDY OR THE END OF THE WORLD FOR THE U.K. GOING TO LEAVE IT WOULD BE WORSE
THE TIMES THAT LEADS ON TODAY'S LETTER FROM NEARLY THIRTEEN HUNDRED BUSINESS LEADERS CLAIMING BRICKS IT WOULD DAMAGE THE BRITISH ECONOMY IT SAYS WITH THE OUTCOME SO UNCERTAIN SOME BOSSES WHO OPTED OUT OF HER PREVIOUS LETTER IN FEBRUARY AND NOW JOINING THE CALL TO REMAIN ACCORDING TO THE DAILY TELEGRAPH MICHAEL GAVE US COMPARE THE REPEATED INTERVENTIONS OF ECONOMIC EXPERTS IN THE REFERENDUM TO AN INCIDENT IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES IN WHICH ONE HUNDRED SCIENTISTS IN THE PAY OF THE NAZI AUTHORITIES
DENOUNCED EINSTEIN AND SAID HE WAS WRONG EINSTEIN REPLIED IF I WAS WRONG ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH
THE DAILY MAIL HAS A DOUBLE PAGE EDITORIAL ARE GOING FOR BRECHT SAID IT WONDERS WHY ON EARTH WE SHOULD WANT TO BELONG TO WHAT HE CALLS A DYSFUNCTIONAL CLUB WITH AN IMPLODING ECONOMY PURSUING A MAD POLICY HAVE OPEN BORDERS THIS IS OUR ONE CHANCE AS THE MALE WE MUST SEIZE THE SERVANT THE EXPRESS LEAD ON THE CLAIM BY THE ROYAL BIOGRAPHER ROBERT LACEY AT THE QUEEN RECENTLY ASKED DINNER GUEST TO GIVE HER THREE GOOD REASONS WHY BRITAIN SHOULD BE PART OF EUROPE NOW
WE CAN'T THINK OF ONE SEVERAL PAPERS ARE PICTURES OF WHAT THE EXPRESS DESCRIBED AS THE BATTLE OF CALAIS MIGRANTS TRYING TO GET INTO THE U.K. COMMITTING GRAPPLING WITH POLICE CLIMBING ONTO LORRIES THE DAILY MAIL HAS TO DOUBLE PAGE SPREADS HER PHOTOS AND DESCRIBES ONE HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS FOUGHT RUNNING BATTLES WITH THE FRENCH POLICE YESTERDAY AS THEY TRIED TO SNEAK ONTO U.K. BOUND LORRIES THE SUN CALLS IT MAYHEM
THE LEAD IN THE MAIL THE B. B. C. HAS CAVED IN AND APOLOGISE TO SIR CLIFF RICHARD HE WAS CONSIDERING SUING THE B.B.C. OVER ITS COVERAGE OF THE POLICE RAID ON HIS HOME THE PAPER CALLS IT A HOLLOW APOLOGY BECAUSE BEAUTY STILL STANDS BY ITS HANDLING OF THE STORY IN HER EXPRESS COLUMN AND WIDDICOMBE ARGUES THAT THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE
NEEDS TO FIND A NEW FORMULA TO REPLACE THE PHRASE INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE SHE SUGGESTS NO EVIDENCE BEYOND THE ORIGINAL ALLEGATION SO PAPERS REPORT ON A REVELATION AT THE SECURITY SERVICES ARE TO BE GIVEN WHAT THE GUARDIAN DESCRIBES AS A BULK LICENCE TO HACK INTO ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN A TOWN WHAT CRITICS CALL THE SNOOPERS CHARTER OFFICIALLY MENDS THE INVESTIGATOR HE POWERS BILL
THE PATHS WOULD APPARENTLY BE USED IF A MAJOR TOWN OVERSEAS WAS TARGETED BY TERRORISTS LIB DEMS SAYS THE GARDEN HAVE PROMISED TO TEAR OUT THE WORST ELEMENTS OF THE BILL AT THE FINAL THOUGHT ON THE REFERENDUM LETTER WRITER IN THE TELEGRAPH WANTS TO KNOW
THIS WIRE THAT THE RESULT IS COMING DOWN TO IS IT ANYWHERE NEAR THE PLATE THAT WE MUST ALL STEP UP TWO ON THURSDAY BUT THE TIME SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND THEIR HEADLINE THIS MORNING THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING BOTH SIDES IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE ARE MAKING THEIR FINAL PITCHES TO VOTERS ON THE LAST DAY OF CAMPAIGN
YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY BOOKED YOUR HOLIDAY IF YOU'RE FLYING THE OLD PERHAPS HAVE SHOPPED AROUND TO GET THE BEST EFFORT THERE'S MORE CHOICE THAN THERE WAS A FEW YEARS AGO SOMETHING SUCCESSIVE BRITISH GOVERNMENTS HAVE CHAMPIONED WE HAVE SELECTED AS THE LAST IN OUR SERIES ON OBJECTS AND OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS AFFECTED OUR LIVES THE AEROPLANE IS MATTHEW PRICE MY KNICKERS
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW THE EUROPEAN UNION REMOVED BORDERS HOW IT TOOK AWAY BRITISH NATIONAL CONTROL OVER AN IMPORTANT PART OF AN IMPORTANT INDUSTRY THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY
OUR STORY BEGINS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WITH THIS ALL SMILES T. V. E. AD FOR BRITISH AIRWAYS
FLY BRITISH AIRWAYS BACK THERE NAH GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED THE AIR ROUTES INTO AND OUT OF THE U.K. THERE WAS A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH EACH AND EVERY
COUNTRY WE FLEW TO THAT AGREEMENT WOULD STIPULATE WHICH AIRLINES COULD OPERATE THE ROOTS AND THERE WOULD BE TWO ONE FROM EACH NATION JUST TWO AIRLINES
THAT'S DOCTOR LUCY BADA SENIOR LECTURER IN AIR TRANSPORT AT LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY NOW THE AGREEMENTS CONTROL EVERYTHING FROM WHICH AIRPORTS COULD BE SERVED TO THE CAPACITY ON THOSE ROOTS HOW MANY SEATS WOULD BE AVAILABLE EVERY WEEK AND THE AIR FARES THAT THE AIRLINES COULD CHARGE IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU WANTED TO FLY FROM THE U.K. TO FRANCE
YOU'D HAVE THE CHOICE OF TWO AIRLINES BASICALLY BE YOUR AIR FRANCE BUT THEN THE AMERICANS STARTED TO OPEN UP THEIR AIR ROUTES TO GREATER COMPETITION AND THE U.K. WELL WE THOUGHT THAT A GOOD IDEA SO WE SIGNED AN OPEN MARKET AGREEMENT WITH THE NETHERLANDS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO STIMULATE COMPETITION ON THE VERY IMPORTANT ROUTE BETWEEN LONDON AND
OH HE THOUGHT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IT WAS WORRIED THIS WOULD LEAD TO A FRAGMENTATION OF AIR SERVICES ACROSS THE CONTINENT SO IT DECIDED TO SET ALL OF EUROPE ALONG THE BRITISH ROUTE AND DOWN THE FLIGHT PATH TO REFORM
FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN EUROPE STARTED TO LIBERALISED AIR TRAVEL IT DID IT BY CREATING A SINGLE AIR TRANSPORT MARKET WITHIN THE E.U. ANY MEMBER STATE AIRLINE COULD TREAT THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A DOMESTIC MARKET FOR THE PURPOSES OF OPERATING SERVICES
FOR THE FIRST TIME ANY AIRLINE REGISTERED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR EXAMPLE COULD OPERATE DOMESTIC SERVICES WITHIN ITALY WITHIN SPAIN WITH ANY OTHER E.U. MEMBER STATE SO DOZENS OF BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WERE REPLACED WITH ONE SINGLE YOU AGREEMENT AND NOW IT'S THE E.U. THAT CONTINUES TO NEGOTIATE AND EXPAND TO THIS AGREEMENT TO OTHER COUNTRIES
THERE'S ALSO THE OPEN SKIES AGREEMENT BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE U.S. THE RESULT CHEAPER FLIGHTS MORE CHOICE
ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNERS DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S LED TO MORE PLANES ON MORE ROUTES BETWEEN MORE CITIES MY NAME'S KEVIN CLARKE AND I'M A FLIGHT DELAY LAWYER AT BOTTON CO SOLICITORS HERE'S A MAN WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT EUROPEAN LAW WHEN IT COMES TO THAT INEVITABLE DELAY YOU CAN CLAIM COMPENSATION IF YOU'RE ON A FLIGHT WHICH IS DEPARTING FROM AN E.U. COUNTRY OR COMING BACK INTO AN E.U. COUNTRY WITH AN E.U. CARRIER
AND YOU ARE DELAYED FOR LONGER THAN THREE HOURS THEN YOU ARE ENTITLED TO UP TO SIX HUNDRED YEAR OLD UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S ANOTHER E.U. AGREEMENT FROM TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR BRIGHTER THE REGULATION THERE WAS NOTHING ENSHRINED IN LAW SO IT WAS IT WAS VERY MUCH A CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE IT THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE MONTREAL CONVENTION WHICH GOVERNS COURAGE BY HER PASSENGERS IN THE AIR BUT THAT'S NOT AS CLEAR
IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANISATION HELD THE CONFIT
IN THE U.K. WE GAVE A PRESENTATION ON WHAT DEREGULATION REGULATION OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAD MEANT AND THIS WAS THEIR CONCLUSION
NOT KNOWING WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE ABSENCE OF LIBERALISATION MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE SINGLE AVIATION MARKET IN EUROPE WITH HIM
WHICH IS ABOUT TO GO FOR FRANK SURELY AS WHAT WE'RE OIL GRAPPLING WITH FROM NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF COUNTRY HE WOULD BE IF WE HAD NEVER JOINED THE
NOR DO WE KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF WE STAY IF WE LEAVE BUT HOPEFULLY OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS THIS LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF MEMBERSHIP ON EVERYTHING FROM THE SAUSAGE THE MOBILE PHONE
CLOCKS E. CIGARETTES CARS AND MUCH MORE HAS GIVEN YOU SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT AS YOU PONDER PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION WE AS INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH IN DECADES
I HAVE TO PRICE REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES ARE SIMILAR YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF EPI GENOMES YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE WELL
THEY'RE LIKE AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR CHEMICALS AND THEY TELL A JEANS HOW TO BEHAVE AND IT TURNS OUT THEY ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT'S THE REASON WHY TWO PEOPLE WITH IDENTICAL D.N.A. COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT ONE FAT ONE THIN RESEARCHERS IN THE UNITED STATES OF STUDY THEIR EFFECT ON JUST ONE GENE OXY TAKES IN AND FOUND THAT IT CAN INFLUENCE SOCIAL BEHAVIOURS SUCH AS UNDERSTANDING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OR HOW WE FEEL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS PROFESSOR ALICIA SMITH'S A CO AUTHOR ON THAT
THE BRAIN RESPONSE IT'S SOCIAL SITUATIONS THEY'RE WORKING
DISORDER PARTNERS AND THEY'D HAVE A STRONG SPECIAL CHRONIC WELL DONE CARE IS VISITING PROFESSOR AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON AND THE AUTHOR OF THE EPI GENETICS REVOLUTION AND DOCTOR CARRIE IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND JUST A TEN SECOND PRIMER ON EPI GENETICS SURE WE ALL INHERIT D.N.A. FROM OUR PARENTS IT'S A GENETIC CODE KIND OF INSTRUCTION MANUAL BUT
THAT STAYS THE SAME ALL OUR LIVES HOWEVER YOU CAN GET LITTLE CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS ADDED TO IT CALLED EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS AND THOSE DON'T CHANGE OUR GENES WHAT THEY DO IS THEY INFLUENCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A GENE WILL BE SWITCHED ON OR SWITCHED OFF AND THEY CAN ALSO CHANGE HOW HIGH THE IT SWITCHED ON SWITCHED OFF SO THEY'RE LIKE A KIND OF VOLUME SWITCH ON A GOOD EXAMPLE
SO IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU START DRINKING LOTS AND LOTS OF ALCOHOL YOUR LIVER NEEDS TO PRODUCE MORE OF THE PROTEIN BREAKS DOWN ALCOHOL SO YOU'LL GET LITTLE EPI GENETIC MODIFICATIONS HE'S A LITTLE CHEMICALS ADDED TO THE GENES IN THE LIVER
AND THOSE WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE PROTEIN BREAKS DOWN ALCOHOL AND THAT'S WHY IF YOU'RE DRINKING YOU FIND YOU HAVE TO DRINK MORE AND MORE TO GET THE SAME BUZZ THAT'S BEFORE HE STARTED DRINKING RIGHT SO EPIGENETICS
WHAT ARE THEY I MEAN YOU CAN'T CAN YOU SEE THEM NO YOU CAN'T SEE THEM THE EASIEST WAY TO THINK OF THEM IS JUST LIKE A SCRIPT FOR A PLAY YOU CAN PUT POST IT NOTES ON IT SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE AN IDEA OF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT THEY KIND OF LIKE THAT THEY'RE JUST SMALL LITTLE CHEMICAL GROUPS THERE GET ADDED TO D.N.A. IN DIFFERENT CELLS AND THEY INFLUENCE HOW THINGS HAPPEN AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE REVOLUTION THAT MEANS WHAT WELL
WE USED TO HAVE A HUGE GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING WE KNEW ABOUT D.N.A. AND WE KNEW ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD USE THE SAME D.N.A. SCRIPTS TO GET DIFFERENT OUTCOMES NOW THROUGH EPI GENETICS WE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CAN HAPPEN EPI GENETICS
IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BRIDGES BETWEEN GENES AND THE ENVIRONMENT BETWEEN NATURE AND NURTURE SO IN PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT DO WE DO IF WE CAN'T SEE THESE THINGS DO WE SORT OF RIGHT THE DRINK THE POST IT NOTE FOR THE EPI GENETIC ARSEHOLES DO THAT QUITE NATURALLY AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE WE CAN INFLUENCE THAT KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN INFLUENCE IT BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT VERY WELL WHAT THESE SORTS OF STUDIES ARE DOING ARE JUST USING
VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO ANALYSE WHICH EPI GENETIC MODIFICATIONS ARE IN PLACE SO IN THAT PARTICULAR STUDY THEY HAVEN'T TRIED TO CHANGE THE EPIGENETICS THEY'VE JUST LOOKED AT WHAT IS AROUND WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE WHAT DO WE DO WE HAVE TO BE INCREDIBLY CAREFUL HOW WE APPLY THAT KNOWLEDGE NOW EPIGENETICS HAS BEING USED VERY SUCCESSFULLY TO TREAT CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER
BUT ONCE YOU GET INTO FIELDS LIKE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR YOU FIND THAT THE DATA ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET AND THIS STUDY SUFFERS FROM A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE IN MANY STUDIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE RUNNING EPIGENETIC ANALYSES AND THEN TRYING TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS FROM THEM THAT'S DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT CAN LEAD US INTO COMPLETE
DEAD ENDS OR DOWN THE WRONG PATH IN THINKING ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT WANT TO TREAT CERTAIN CONDITION TAKES US DOWN THE RIGHT PATH IF IT TAKES US DOWN THE RIGHT PATH IT HAS A GREAT DEAL TO ADD TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN BIOLOGY BUT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW WE RUN THESE EXPERIMENTS WELL WHAT A FASCINATING SO WE THOUGHT O.K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE COULD TALK FOR THREE HOURS AND STILL THEY SCRATCH THE SURFACE WITH ME THAT THERE WE ARE THANK YOU
IT IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WE'RE GOING TO HEAR AN HOUR'S TIME FROM THE GRANDFATHER OF ELLIE BACK THE LITTLE GIRL MURDERED BY HER FATHER BEN BACK ARE AFTER BEING FORCED TO LIVE WITH HIM IN SPITE OF WARNINGS THAT HE WAS VIOLENT
NEIL GRAY LOOKED AFTER ELLIE FOR FIVE YEARS UNTIL A JUDGE RULED THAT SHE SHOULD GO BACK TO HER PARENTS AND DIRECTED AS WELL AT THE SOCIAL SERVICES IN SUTTON SOUTH LONDON PUT HER CASE INTO THE HANDS OF A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR HE KNEW LITTLE ABOUT IT
DENISE LESTER HE'S FAMILY LAWYER WITH MOSS BEACHLEY MY LEMON COLEMAN AND IS ALSO THE LAW SOCIETY'S COUNCIL MEMBER FOR CHILDCARE LAW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING IS AN APPALLING CASE THIS ISN'T IT IT'S SO SAD AND SO TRAGIC
COULD IT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF THE JUDGE WHO EXONERATED
BEN BUTLER HAD BEHAVED DIFFERENTLY THIS IS MISSUS JUSTICE HOGG WHO'S COMING IN FOR QUITE A LOT OF CRITICISM
THE JUDGE MADE THE JUDGEMENT ON THE FAX AT THE TIME AND SHE FOUND THAT THE THRESHOLD
HAD NOT BEEN MET SHE MADE CERTAIN COMMENTS SHE EXONERATED MY PARTNER AND THAT WAS GOING FURTHER THAN THE APPEAL QUARTER COULD BE A PILL CALL YES QUASHED THE CASE AGAIN YES AND SAID ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IMTIAZ FIRMER SHIT SHE DID AND IT WAS WELL IT WAS IT WAS A JUDGEMENT WAS MADE AT THE TIME OUR JUDGES DO HAVE DISCRETION
SHE WAS WITHIN HER JUDICIAL PARAMETERS AT THE TIME AND THE CASE WAS REPORTED THAT TIME IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AS BEING AN UNUSUAL CASE AND IN FACT IT WAS CHAMPIONED AS BEING A CASE THAT WAS AN EXAMPLE WHERE YOU HAVE
OUR CRIMINAL PROCESS THAT'S ONGOING WHICH CAN DELAY WHICH CAN BE DELAYED ALONGSIDE PUBLIC LAW PROCEEDINGS IF THOUGH I MEAN THE OTHER POINT THAT PEOPLE MAKE ABOUT THIS CASE IS THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE PUBLICITY AROUND
THE JUDGEMENT GIVEN BY MISSUS JUSTICE HOP AND OF COURSE THIS WAS A FAMILY COURTS HAVE VERY VERY LIMITED REPORTING ALLOWED IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE PUBLICITY ABOUT IT MORE DISCUSSION OF IT AT THE TIME THEN PERHAPS THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IN A GENERAL SENSE DO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT THAT WE HAVE GOT TO THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THIS CASE TELLS US
WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AGAIN AT THE OPENNESS OF THE FAMILY COURTS WHEN I CERTAINLY THINK THERE IS A CONTINUING ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE FAMILY COURTS AS A MORE GENERAL ARGUMENTS AND THAT'S BALANCED AGAINST THE NEED NOT TO IDENTIFY THE CHILDREN AND CHILDREN'S WELFARE EXACTLY AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY THERE ISN'T A LOT OF ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT MEANS THAT A JUDGE WHO MAKES A JUDGEMENT THAT WAS VERY HEAVILY CONTESTED AT THE TIME
BY THE GRANDFATHER IN THIS CASE AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM EMMA NO THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC TO THINK ABOUT LOOK AND WHAT IT WAS IT WAS PUBLISHED IT WAS PUBLISHED LATER ON WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW AND YOU KNOW HINDSIGHT'S A WONDERFUL THING IS WE THERE WAS THE INSTANT THE HAPPEN THEN AND WE COULD NOT OF NOBODY
EXCEPT THE GRANDFATHER WHO IT NOW COMES OUT SAID THERE MAY BE BLOOD
YOUR HANDS TO THE JUDGE THAT'S NOT HE SAID IN COURT ISN'T ABSOLUTELY NATION ABSOLUTELY WHICH IS MADE PUBLIC NOW WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN HOW EVENTS WOULD HAVE UNFOLDED BUT THERE WAS A SENSE THERE
THE REALITY IS THAT PARENTS DO FIGHT FOR THE RETURN OF THEIR CHILDREN'S CARE AND THIS WAS A CASE WHERE IT HAPPENED BUT SOCIAL SERVICES CERTAINLY HAVE PUBLISHED THEIR SERIOUS CASE REVIEW THEY SAID THERE WERE LESSONS TO BE LEARNT THERE WAS A PRIVATE
ER ORGANISATION MANAGING THE CASE WHICH IS UNUSUAL THIS WAS ALSO THE DIRECTION OF THE JUDGE WASN'T IT THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT BUT THAT DOESN'T ABROGATE THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR THEIR GENERAL DUTY TO TO LOOK AFTER CHILDREN AND PROMOTES AND SAFEGUARD THEIR WELFARE AND THEIR SCHOOL
THE SCHOOL CERTAINLY HAD CONCERNS BUT WHAT THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE THIS WAS A PRIVATE ORGANISATION AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO REPORT AND IT'S OF CONCERN AS SOCIAL SERVICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY POTENTIALLY OUTSOURCE ARRANGEMENTS THIS IS A CONTINUING POTENTIAL CONCERN FOR CHILDREN WHO COULD POTENTIALLY BE NEED DENISE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AS I SAY WE'LL BE TALKING TO NEIL GREAT ELLIE'S GRANDFATHER IN AN HOUR'S TIME

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE TWENTY SECOND OF JUNE THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON AND BORIS JOHNSON ARE MAKING THEIR FINAL APPEALS TO VOTERS ON THE LAST DAY OF CAMPAIGNING BEFORE THE E.U. REFERENDUM MORE THAN A THOUSAND BUSINESS LEADERS HAVE WORN THAT LEAVING THE Y. YOU COULD DAMAGE THE BRITISH ECONOMY THE INVENTOR SIR JAMES DYSON SAYS A VOTE TO REMAIN WOULD BE AN ACT OF NATIONAL SELF HARM
AND EVENTS TO CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF JOE COX WILL TAKE PLACE IN LONDON BRUSSELS AND NEW YORK ON WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER FORTY SECOND BIRTHDAY TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS ZEB SOAMES
BOTH SIDES OF THE DEBATE WILL MAKE THEIR CLOSING ARGUMENTS AS CAMPAIGNING ENTERS ITS FINAL DAY IN THE MOST BITTERLY FOUGHT REFERENDUM HELD ACROSS THE U.K. FOR DECADES DURING THE PAST FOUR MONTHS THE RIVAL CAMPS HAVE TRADED BLOWS ON A NUMBER OF MAJOR ISSUES AS NOTABLY THE IMPACT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE ECONOMY AND IMMIGRATION
THESE ISSUES WERE AGAIN AT THE FOREFRONT OF A LIVE TELEVISED DEBATE HELD LAST NIGHT BY THE B. B. C. IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE OF SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE AT WEMBLEY ARENA IN LONDON FROM THERE A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IN WATSON SENT THIS REPORT
IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE POLES WILL HAVE OPENED AND FOR MONTHS OF ROBUST CAMPAIGNING WILL HAVE COME TO AN END POLITICS AS USUAL HAS BEEN SUSPENDED WITH MEMBERS OF THE CABINET ON OPPOSING SIDES AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT NORMAL SERVICE WILL EVER RESUME
THE ARGUMENTS WERE DISTILLED IN LAST NIGHT'S B.B.C. DEBATE THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN REFUSED TO SEED GROWN TO THEIR OPPONENTS ON THE ECONOMY SATING THEIR BUSINESSES WHICH WANTED TO BE FREE FROM WHAT THEY SAW AS BRUSSELS BUREAUCRACY THERE ARE MAIN CAMPAIGN OAST FORTAS HAD YET TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO TRUST THE EXPERTS I'M IT WAS INEVITABLE THERE'D BE A CLASH ON IMMIGRATION
THE MAYOR OF LONDON SIDIQUE KHAN ACCUSED ME OF CAMPAIGN OF PERPETUATING WHAT'S HE CALLED PROJECT HATE AN ALLEGATION WHICH HIS OPPONENTS TONIGHT
AND THE T.U.C. IS FRANCES O'GRADY WHO ALSO WANTS TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. WAS SCEPTICAL THAT LEAVING WOULD BRING NET MIGRATION DOWN I THINK BELIEVE CAMPAIGN A SEVEN PEOPLE A BIG CALL
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PROMISING TO REDUCE NUMBERS YOU HAD NEVER PROMISE
REDUCE SNOT AND AS A REMINDER THAT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS HIGHLIGHTED SOME DISAGREEMENTS ON THE LEFT TO THE RESPONSE CAME FROM THE LABOUR M.P. STUART WHO WANTS TO LEAVE YOU
WHAT AN AUSTRALIAN POINT SYSTEM WITH ALLOW YOU DECIDE WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE AT THE MOMENT YOU CAN'T
AT TIMES THE DEBATE'S REFLECTED THE TONE OF MUCH OF THE PAST FEW MONTHS WITH THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. BORIS JOHNSON ACCUSINGLY REMAIN CUP OF SCAREMONGERING AND THE LEADER OF THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVES RUTH DAVIDSON DENOUNCING LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS AS LIARS
DELIGHT ABOUT TURKEYS ENTRANCE TO EUROPE THE ALLIES
ARMY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A BITTER WAR BY THAT THEY COULD BE
O.K. THERE WERE SOME FRESH VOICES IN THE B.B.C. DEBATE BUT FEWER FRESH ARGUMENTS AND ON THIS LAST DAY OF CAMPAIGNING IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE POLITICIANS WILL GIVE VOTERS TIME FOR QUIET REFLECTION
MORE THAN A THOUSAND BUSINESS LEADERS HAVE WRITTEN TO THE TIMES TO WARN THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD HOME BRITISH TRADE AND JOBS THE SIGNATORIES INCLUDE THE BOSSES ARE FIFTY ONE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES AND HUNDREDS OF SMALLER BUSINESSES TOGETHER THEY EMPLOY ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IS A BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK
THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS ASSEMBLED ITS BIGGEST AND BROADEST COLLECTION OF BUSINESS NAMES TO DATE TO PRESS THEIR CASE FOR STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN AN OPEN LETTER REPRESENTATIVES OF TWELVE HUNDRED COMPANIES INCLUDING FIFTY ONE OF THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED ARGUE THAT A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND THE SINGLE MARKET WOULD BE BAD FOR BUSINESS AND FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY A PREVIOUS LETTER SIGNED BY A SMALLER GROUP OF THIRTY SIX FOOTSIE CHIEFS PROMPTED CRITICISMS OF A COSY ALLIANCE OF THOSE WITH A VESTED INTEREST IN THE STATUS QUO
THIS LETTER NOT ONLY TRUMPS FEBRUARY'S EFFORT IN TERMS OF NUMBERS BUT IT'S BROADENED THE PALL OF BUSINESSES TO INCLUDE NINE HUNDRED TEN SMALLER FIRMS
BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE A VOTE THEY DO HAVE A VOICE BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER SHOWS A FORCE FROM BUSINESS OWNERS AND MANAGERS MOVE THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF WORKERS WHO CAN VOTE

THANK YOU IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN ON THE FINAL DAY OF REFERENDUM CAMPAIGNING WE HAVE TWO LETTERS ONE TO THE TIMES FROM BUSINESS LEADERS FOR REMAIN THE OTHER ONE FROM THE SUGAR COMPANY TATE AND LYLE TO ALL ITS STAFF SAYING THAT THE COMPANY WOULD DO BETTER OUTSIDE THAT YOU YOU IN A MOMENT THOUGHTS ON THOSE LETTERS AND INDEED THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN FROM THE CONSERVATIVE M.E.P. DANIEL HANNAN FIRST THERE SIMON JACK OUR BUSINESS EDITOR
ON THE LETTERS AND PARTICULARLY IN THIS LETTER WHICH IS A BIG ONE ISN'T IT IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE EMPLOYING A LOT OF A LOT OF EMPLOYEES AROUND THE COUNTRY PERSUADED TO SIGN UP AT THE LAST MINUTE AND SOME SOMEHOW DIDN'T SIGN EARLIER BUSINESS LETTERS WHICH IS INTERESTING THIS IS THEIR LAST PUSH THEY'VE ASSEMBLED THEIR BIGGEST AND PROBABLY BROADEST COLLECTION OF BUSINESS OF VOICES ON THIS ISSUE AS YOU SAY THERE WAS A LETTER BACK IN FEBRUARY WHICH HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE ON
THIRTY FIVE OF WHICH WERE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED SIOS THIS IS TWELVE HUNDRED BUSINESSES FIFTY ONE OF THE FOOTSIE ONE COMPANIES ARE REPRESENTED HERE YOU ASKED ASDA ASTRA SENECA ALL THE WAY UP TO VODAFONE WHITBREAD AND USE SUSHI AND WHILE YOU DO HAVE A LETTER ALSO FROM TATE AND LYLE I HAVE TO SAY WHAT WE CAN SAY I THINK WITH CONFIDENCE IS THAT WHILE THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS PRETTY EVENLY SPLIT ON THIS ISSUE
THE BIG BUSINESS COMMUNITY I THINK IS OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN IN THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BIG BUSINESS AND SMALL BUSINESS MAY BE TO DO WITH THE GREATER SIGNIFICANCE THAT BIG BUSINESSES PUT ON THE SINGLE MARKET WHICH LEAF THEY WE WOULD LEAVE IF WE WERE TO GO SO I THINK IT I LIKE HER SO WHAT IT'S PRETTY EVENLY SPLIT ON SMOKERS
BIG BUSINESS OVERWHELMINGLY REMAIN
THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET US TALK TO DANIEL HANNAN CEREMONY PAY LEAVE CAMPAIGNER IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS LETTER WE KNOW THAT BIG BUSINESSES LIKE BRUSSELS THEY'VE SPENT YEARS AND THEY'VE SPENT MILLIONS LOBBYING IN BRUSSELS TO GET RULES THAT SUIT THEM
HURT RIFLES NOT JUST BIG BUSINESS IS SIGNING UP THERE QUITE A FEW SMALLER ONES AS I AGREE VERY MUCH WITH WHAT YOU SAID THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS DELIGHTED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MEGA BANKS AND THE LARGE MULTINATIONALS WHICH ARE OVERWHELMINGLY PRO YOU BECAUSE THEY'VE USED THE REGULATORY SYSTEM IN BRUSSELS TO RAISE BARRIERS TO ENTRY TO MAKE IT MUCH TOUGHER FOR A START UP OR AN INNOVATOR TO CHALLENGE THEM SO QUITE UNDERSTANDABLY THEY WANT TO STAY IN BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST LET ALONE THE INTEREST OF THE CAN
BUT IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY ONE OF THESE BUSINESSES THERE'S A SORT OF PSYCHOLOGY ISN'T THERE IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR OWN ECONOMICS SAFETY AND IF YOU READ THIS LETTER SAYING WE KNOW OUR FIRMS ARE STRONGER IN EUROPE WHO WE WILL TAKE LESS TRADE WITH EUROPE THAT'S WHAT THE LETTER SAYS IF WE LEAVE BUT CERTAINLY GIVE YOU PAUSE WOULDN'T IT
I DON'T BELIEVE WE WILL DO LET'S TRADE WITH EUROPE IF I DIDN'T THINK THAT THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE WOULD PROSPER OUTSIDE I WOULDN'T BE URGING YOUR LISTENERS TO FIRE THESE BILL RIGHT ALWAYS AS AS AN EMPLOYEE OF ONE OF THESE BUSINESSES YOU WOULD HEAR YOU ON ONE SIDE AND YOU WERE GREAT RESPECT ANY YOU'VE EVER RUN A BUSINESS AND YOU WOULD HEATS HERE YOUR EMPLOYER ON THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU'D THINK WELL I
THERE'S NO REAL REASON NOT TO BACK THE EMPLOYER IN THIS ARGUMENT I'M NOT TO BELIEVE THE EMPLOYER AND THE SIGN I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING TO THAT TO STRESS WHAT HAPPENS IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE TOMORROW THERE'S NOTHING IMMEDIATE AND THERE'S NOTHING RADICAL AND IF THERE HAS BEEN A VERY LARGE FOLK TO STAY IF THERE'S A VERY NARROW VOTE TO LEAVE THEN OBVIOUSLY
THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT IT WAS A EVENLY DIVIDED ELECTORATE THAT THAT'S NOT A MANDATE TO DO ANYTHING PRECIPITOUS IT'S NOT A MANDATE TO DO ANYTHING UNILATERAL THAT WILL NEED TO GO BACK TO OUR PARTNERS AND SECURE I HOPE WITH THEIR CONSENT AN AGREEMENT A PHASED REPATRIATION OF POWER
BUT IF HALF THE COUNTRY OR CLOSE TO HALF THE COUNTRIES VOTED TO STAY THEN THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE ELEMENTS OF THE CURRENT DEAL THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REMAIN IN PLACE AND I THINK WE WILL NEED TO TAKE ON BOARD
THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY BUSINESS IF WE HAVE A NARROW MARGIN WILL HAVE TO PUT HER TO WORK ON THE BASIS THAT WE ARE MOVING TO RESTORE OUR INDEPENDENCE OVER TIME AND WITH THE AGREEMENT OF I WAS CARRYING THE WHOLE COUNTRY WITH THAT'S INTERESTING DOES THAT MEAN STAYING IN THE SINGLE MARKET
WELL EXACTLY HOW IT'S GONNA BE DONE WILL BE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY THAT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU'RE ALLOWING WELL I THINK THE ONE THING THAT EVERYONE AGREES ON IS HAVING CONTINUED TARIFF FREE TRADE WITH THE E.U. I DON'T THINK ANYONE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL IS SUGGESTING THAT THEY WOULD BE TRADE BARRIERS IT'S NOT IN ANYONE'S INTEREST THE LAST THING THAT THE OTHER COUNTRIES ONE IS A PROTRACTED ROW WITH US OVER THAT AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE ON THE LEAVE SIDE HERE THAT WANTS TO HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON COMMERCE
THE COUPLE ARE WIDER POINTS THE FIRST ONE VEST THIS THIS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK FIGURE THAT YOUR SIGHT HAS SEIZED ON AS BEING THE AMOUNT THAT WE PAID FOR EUROPEAN UNION WIDELY CONDEMNED BELIEVED BY MOST INDEPENDENT
PEOPLE TO BE SIMPLY WRONG DID YOU BECOME
DURING THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN AS YOU'VE BEEN DOING YOU'RE PERSUADING AND AS YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE ARGUMENTS ON ONE SIDE DO YOU REGRET NOW THAT YOUR SIDE HAVE SEIZED ON THAT NO WAS JUST NO I'M VERY COMFORTABLE TO DEFEND THAT FIGURE BUT IT IS WRONG IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROSS AND NET AND I THINK PEOPLE LISTENING ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND WHEN I WOULDN'T SAY THE WORD SIMON JUST A LONG QUESTION JUST ENDED
TO FOCUS ON THE WORD SEND YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I MEAN IT WE DON'T KNOW LITERALLY IN A DIGITISED AGE PUT GOLD IN THE BACK OF A VAN AND SHOP THE DOORS AND DRIVE IT ACROSS THE CHANNEL BUT THAT'S WHAT APPEARS AS HAVING BEEN DEBITED THAT'S HOW IT WORKS IN AN ELECTRONIC AGE AND THAT FIGURE CAME FROM THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS IT'S NOT WANT I PLUCKED OUT OF THE AIR PEOPLE LISTENING UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROSS AND NET IF I SAY TO YOU WHAT'S BASIC RATE INCOME TAX
YOU WILL PRESUMABLY SAY IT'S TWENTY P. IN THE POUND YOU WOULDN'T SAY AH WELL BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S ACTUALLY ZERO BECAUSE WE GET IT ALL BACK IN ROADS AND SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS THE YES IT'S TRUE SOME OF THAT MONEY IS REBATED SOME OF IT IS SPENT IN THE U.K. BUT IT'S NOT SPENT ON THINGS WE'VE CHOSEN VERY BENT ON BUYING THE LOYALTY OF THESE GREY AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO STICK THAT THING ABOUT THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT AS WELL I DID DID YOU FEEL IT GOT US ANYWHERE RUTH DAVIDSON WAS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE PRETTY FORMIDABLE
THERE ARE GOOD PATRIOTIC PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEBATE AND ALL OF US KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE A BIT LIKE THEY WERE VOTING BOTH WAYS BUT I THINK THERE WAS A CLEAR CONTRAST BETWEEN AN ESSENTIALLY OPTIMISTIC MESSAGE THAT THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY ABLE TO FLOURISH UNDER ITS OWN LAWS TRADING WITH FRIENDS AND ALLIES ON EVERY CONTINENT INCLUDING EUROPE GOVERNING ITSELF
AND YET MORE I'M AFRAID OF THE SORT OF THE CONSTANT KNOCKING OPPRESSION THE UNCERTAINTY THAT DOWN TO THE SENSE THAT SOMEHOW WE ARE UNIQUELY INCAPABLE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO WHAT JAPAN ON NEW ZEALAND OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY TAKES FOR GRANTED WHICH IS TO MAKE ITS OWN LAWS WHILE TRADING AND CO OPERATING WITH ALLY'S ON EVERY CONTINENT NICOLA STURGEON SAID YESTERDAY THAT SHE THOUGHT THE KILLING OF JOE COX WOULD AFFECT THE OUTCOME DO YOU THINK SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT
I ALMOST FIND THAT THE QUESTION SLIGHTLY INAPPROPRIATE I MEAN THAT THIS IS SOMEONE WHOSE CHILDREN ARE STILL GRIEVING WHOSE HUSBAND IS STILL IN SHOCK TO BE PRESSING INTO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE REFERENCE I'M NOT ASKING FOR AN ARGUMENT I'M JUST OBSERVING THAT NICOLA STURGEON VERY SENIOR POLITICIAN SAID THAT YESTERDAY I JUST WONDER WHETHER YOU THINK SHE'S RIGHT
DO YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL MAKE AN ASSESSMENT ABOUT WHAT'S IN OUR INTERESTS NOT JUST NOW BUT IN THE LONG TERM FUTURE AND THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT IS GENERATIONAL I THINK BOTH SIDES AGREE ON THAT THIS IS AN EPOCHAL CHOICE EVERY CONTINENT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS GROWN EXCEPT EUROPE WE NEED TO BE WHERE THE GROWING MARKETS ARE WE SHOULDN'T BE CONFINED IN THE WORLD'S ONLY STAGNANT CUSTOMS UNION AND I THINK THAT IS SUCH A HUGE ISSUE THAT WHEN PEOPLE GO AND VOTE TOMORROW LOOK IT'S NOT GOING TO
BE A MAGIC WAND IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. IT WILL BE A GRADUAL PROCESS AS LORD ROSE SAYS AFTER FIVE YEARS YOU PROBABLY WON'T NOTICE IT BUT OVER TIME WE WILL BRING BACK OUR FREEDOM OUR INDEPENDENCE AND OUR PROSPERITY ALL WE NEED IS THE COURAGE TOMORROW TO TAKE THAT FIRST PLACE DANIEL HANNON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED A LINK BETWEEN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND DIABETES AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY THINK IT'LL HELP GIVE US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH DISEASES PRESS OF ATHENA PAT HIS CHAIR IN TRANSLATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE DEAN UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCE'S THE PROFESSOR CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA I KNOW IT'S A HIGHLY COMPLICATED TECHNICAL THING BUT CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT THE LINK IS
RIGHT GOOD MORNING MOLLY WE HAVE KNOWN FOR A WHILE THAT DIABETES IS THE RISK FACTOR BECAUSE I'LL TAMWORTH AND OTHER TYPES OF DEMENTIA ARE BY AND LARGE LIFESTYLE RELATED
NOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE TO INVESTIGATE THIS LINK FURTHER IS INTRODUCE A GENE THAT HER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED IN HUMANS TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF TOXIC PROTEIN IN THE BRAIN AND WHEN WE INTRODUCE THAT IN EXTRA MENTAL MODELS WE ACTUALLY FIND THAT WE DEVELOP BOTH ALZHEIMER'S SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO DIABETES SYMPTOMS AT THE SAME TIME SO CAN WE TURN OFF THE GENE
WELL WE CAN'T TURN IT OFF BUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF DRUG DISCOVERY PROGRAMMES ON GOING RIGHT NOW TO TRY AND BASICALLY INHIBITED OF REDUCE ITS ACTIVITY
AND THAT TREND HAPPENED SORT OF NOW NO NO NO THAT WE KNOW IT EXISTS AND PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT DOES WE CAN START WORKING ON THAT IMMEDIATELY CAN WEEP THAT'S WELL YES WE CAN AND THE GOOD NEWS IN THIS CONTEXT THIS THAT IN TERMS OF THE DIABETES ANGLE AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF DIABETES RELATED PATH WEST THERE IS OBVIOUSLY ALREADY DRAGS OUT IN THE MARKET TO CONTROL TYPE TWO DIABETES AND AT THE MOMENT THERE'S ALREADY SOME CLINICAL TRIALS ON GOING
SO WE MAY BE AT A STAGE WHERE IN THE NEXT WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WE WERE USUALLY TALK ABOUT YOURS IN THESE THINGS AREN'T WE BUT MONTHS OR YEARS BEFORE WE'D HAVE SOMETHING THAT WILL
WILL HELP WILL NOT CURE THE DISEASE IT MAY BE BUT SLOW THEM DOWN IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL I'M ALWAYS VERY RELUCTANT TO RAISE FALSE HOPES BECAUSE THAT JUST HAPPENING QUITE A LOT AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A PREDICTION IF I SAY THE CAKE OR TRY AS I'M GOING WE WOULD HOPE THAT WE HAVE FIRST TO ROBUST
MAYBE WITHIN FIVE YEARS THE PROBLEM WITH DEMENTIA DRUG TRIALS AS THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT MUCH LONGER TO BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN BECAUSE THERE'S USUALLY QUITE A PRONOUNCED PLACEBO EFFECT AND WE OFTEN SEE A TEMPORARY IMPROVEMENT WHICH IS THEY'RE NOT MAINTAINED ALL THE TIME SO THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG SIX SO PEOPLE SORT OF THINK THAT THEY OUGHT TO GET BETTER BECAUSE THEY HAD TAKEN THIS DRUG OR THAT DRUG AND SOMETIMES THEY ACTUALLY DO GET BETTER BUT THEN OF COURSE THE GREAT THEY REGRESS
YES WE'VE SEEN THAT MANY TIMES IN THE PAST SQUAT THE PLACEBO EFFECT YES THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM BUT YOU ARE OPTIMISTIC WITHOUT PUTTING WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS IS AT LEAST ANOTHER STEP FORWARD IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH OF THESE
TERRIBLE DISEASES YES DEFINITELY I MEAN WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THERE WAS SOME REPORTS A LAST YEAR THAT THE FACT THAT WE CAN CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE BLOOD PRESSURE MUCH BETTER HAS VERY LIKELY HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON DEMENTIA NUMBERS ACTUALLY STABILISING A LITTLE BIT AND I WOULD ASSUME IF WE MORE ROBUSTLY CONTROL DIABETES RELATED FACTORS THAT WE WILL PROBABLY SEE A SIMILAR BENEFICIAL EFFECT PROFESSOR PLANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY PAST SEVEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AROUND THE WORLD WHILE THE WORLD ECONOMY IS IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION DOMINIKA CARNAL IS HERE HE'S BEEN LOOKING INTO WHAT BYE GOT YOUR THANKS JUST A MINI TRADERS HAVE BEEN SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS ABOUT WHAT BRICKS AT MY MEAN NOT FOR THE POUND IN FOR BRITAIN BUT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD ECONOMY AND IT'S NOT JUST THE TRADE IS THIS IS WHAT JENNY ON THE CHAIRMAN OF AMERICA'S CENTRAL BANK THE FEDERAL RESERVE TOLD A SENATE COMMITTEE YESTERDAY
I THINK THE FINANCIAL MARKET REACTION TO THE UNCERTAINTIES IT WOULD BE UNLEASHED BY THEIR DECISION COULD RESOLVED IN A KIND OF RISK
A SENTIMENT THAT WE WOULD SEE IMPACTS ON FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT WE MIGHT SEE FLIGHT TO SAFETY FLOWS
COULD PUSH UP THE DULL RURA OTHER SO CALLED SAFE IN CURRENCY IS WITH ME NOW TO DISCUSS US AS JEREMY STRETCH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF G. TEN CURRENCIES AT SEA I.B.C. CAPITAL MARKETS GOOD MORNING JEREMY JENNY USED A BIT OF JARGON THEY'RE WHAT IS A RISK OFF MARK AT WIRRAL WHAT TO TRADE DO WIN AT RISK
I THINK IT REFERS TO THE QUESTION OF A FLIGHT TO SAFETY SO WHAT WOULD INVESTORS DOING RISK OFF MARKET WHAT THEY RETREAT BACK TO HOME MARKETS IN TERMS OF MOST INSTANCES SO THOSE INVESTORS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPORTING CAPITAL LOOKING FOR HIGHER RETURN SUDDEN RETREAT BACK TO HOME MARKETS AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY AN IMPACT FOR CURRENCIES AND COUNTRIES LIKE JAPAN WE ALSO SEE INVESTORS UNWINDING HOLDINGS AND EQUITY MARKETS OF THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS WILL BE UNDER THREAT
UNDER BRECHT'S TYPE SCENARIO AND ALSO WE FIND THAT INVESTORS WAS ALSO RETREAT BACK TO THE SAFETY OF GOVERNMENT BONZO PARTICULAR THOSE GOVERNMENT BONDS IN MARKETS WHICH ARE HIGHLY LIQUID SO WE WOULD FIND THAT BOND YIELDS WOULD FALL PROBABLY IN MARKETS LIKE THE U.S. AND IN GERMANY AND OF COURSE THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR GLOBAL INVESTORS PARTICULARLY TERMS OF PENSION FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE IN THEIR RETURNS SAY SAY RISK OFF MEANS EVERYBODY'S TERRIFIED AND RUNNING FOR WHAT THEY THINK ARE SAFE HAVENS
THAT HAS IN RECENT WEEKS MEANT THE YEMEN NOW EVERYBODY RUNS INTO THE INN THAT'S GOING TO DRIVE UP THE BELLY OF THE IN THE COURSE THE BANK OF JAPAN AND THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN HAS ME DOING ALL IT CAN TO PUSH DOWN THE END WHAT WILL THEY DO
AFTER IF ALL THESE PEOPLE RUNNING TO THE END I'LL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK IT JUST UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT WHILST WE'VE BEEN CONCERNED BY THIS RELATIVELY MYOPIC DEBATE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE U.K. WE HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE CENTRAL BANKERS GLOBALLY WILL BE WATCHING THE EVENTS UNFOLD WITH VERY CLOSE INTEREST BECAUSE THE FEAR WOULD BE THAT THE POTENTIALLY THE YEN WOULD APPRECIATE FURTHER IT'S ALREADY APPRECIATED VERY DRAMATICALLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS THAT'S REALLY PUTTING IN
THE PROCESS OF RECOVERY IN THE JAPANESE ECONOMY SO IT WOULD POTENTIALLY THREATENING OP AT THE PROSPECT OF SOME DEGREE OF CURRENCY MARKET INTERVENTION TO TRY AND PRECLUDE A CURRENCY WALL CAN'T COUNT TO MARK AND THAT WE COULD GET INTO SOME WAS ONE OF THESE TIT FOR TAT CURRENCY WAS COMPETITIVE VALUATION WELL I'M NOT SURE WE'LL GET INTO CAN TO VALUATIONS I THINK WILL BE THE CASE THAT THE JAPANESE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME DEGREE OF COORDINATION I THINK THAT WILL BE THEIR ULTIMATE AIM IF THIS SCENARIO PLAYS OUT
THEY WERE PERHAPS TO HARK BACK TO THE REACTION POST THE EARTHQUAKE IN TWENTY ELEVEN WHERE THERE WAS GLOBAL COORDINATED ACTION TO TRY AND STABILISE MARKETS BUT NEVERTHELESS IF THAT WASN'T TO BE FORTHCOMING THEN I THINK THE JAPANESE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO STAND IDLY BY AND ALLOW THEIR CURRENCY TO APPRECIATE VERY DRAMATICALLY AGAINST THEIR TRADING PARTNERS AND COMPROMISE OR FURTHER RISK FURTHER COMPROMISING BOTH MONETARY POLICY TARGETS IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET UP INFLATION
BUT ALSO THEIR GROSS DYNAMICS IN TERMS OF RECOVERY PROCESS SO NO DOUBT THOSE HOTLINES BETWEEN THE WORLD'S CENTRAL BANKS ARE BEING USED AS WE SPARE ABS ABSOLUTELY IT'S VERY MUCH A CASE THAT GLOBALLY INVESTORS WILL BE WATCHING EVENTS UNFOLD HERE IN THE U.K. WITH VERY CLOSE SCRUTINY MARKETS WILL BE REACTING ACCORDINGLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH JEREMY STRETCH OF SEA I.B.C. CAPITAL MARKETS AT LIKE TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN

HE CONTINUES TO DO THAT ON A DAILY BASIS IN THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT FOR A CAPTAIN YOU'VE RULED OUT PERSONALLY THE POSSIBILITY OF LEADING THE LANDS ON THEIR TOUR OF NEW ZEALAND NEXT YEAR BUT WHAT ABOUT HARTLEY AS CAPTAIN
THAT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S SELECTION I'LL LEAVE THAT THERE BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK SO I THINK HE'D BE A GREAT CANDIDATE

THANK YOU WITH A LOOK AHEAD NOW TO EIGHT O'CLOCK TONIGHT AND TO THE MORAL MAZE WERE JOINED BY ED STOURTON GOOD MORNING JUSTIN WHEN THE SPEECHES ON THE DEBATES ARE OVER AND THE VOTES HAVE BEEN COUNTED WHAT WILL WE MAKE OF THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN I DON'T MEAN THE RESULT I MEAN THE PROCESS HAS THIS BEEN A UNIQUELY VILE DISPLAY OF TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLITICS AT THEIR VERY WORST MENDACIOUS HATE FILLED THEM FUELLED BY FEAR
OR HAS IT BEEN A HEALTHY EXERCISE IN TRUE DEMOCRACY IN GAUGING THE VOTERS IN A DEBATE THAT REALLY MATHESON INSPIRING PASSION IN THE WAY THAT AN ISSUE OF SUCH MOMENT DESERVES AND DOES IT HAVE ANY LESSONS TO TEACH US FOR THE FUTURE IS MORE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF THIS KIND THE ANSWER TO THE CYNICISM SO MANY OF US SEEM TO FEEL ABOUT PUBLIC LIFE OR HAS THE REFERENDUM SIMPLY SERVED AS A REMINDER
THAT REALLY COMPLEX DECISIONS ARE BEST LEFT TO THE PEOPLE WE ELECT TO PAY TO WORRY ABOUT SUCH THINGS STRONGLY FOR THE MORAL MAZE ARCHENEMIES OF EIGHT THIS EVENING HERE ON RADIO FOUR THANK YOU EDWARD THE WEATHER RATHER UNSETTLED HER RISK OF DOWNPOURS IN THE SOUTH EAST WERE GETTING USED TO THOUGH
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR JOHN HUMPHRYS AND JUSTIN WEBB THE TIME IS JUST COMING UP TO TWENTY NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND ZEB SAYINGS IS HERE WITH A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS CAMPAIGNERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE E.U. DEBATE ARE MAKING THEIR FINAL ATTEMPTS TO WIN OVER UNDECIDED VOTERS BEFORE THE REFERENDUM TOMORROW IN A TELEVISED DEBATE LAST NIGHT PROMINENT LEVERED REMAIN SUPPORTERS CLASHED OVER THE ISSUES OF IMMIGRATION AND THE ECONOMY
THE FORMER MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON SAID THAT IF BRITAIN VOTED TO LEAVE THEN TOMORROW COULD BE THE COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENCE DAY THE SCOTTISH TORY LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON SAID ALL THE EXPERTS AGREED THAT BRITAIN WAS BETTER OFF IN EUROPE
MORE THAN A THOUSAND BUSINESS LEADERS HAVE WRITTEN TO THE TIMES TO ONE THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD HARM BRITISH TRADE AND JOBS THE SIGNATORIES INCLUDE THE BOSSES ARE FIFTY ONE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES AND HUNDREDS OF SMALLER BUSINESSES THE PRO BRICKS IT SIR JAMES DYSON HAS DESCRIBED THE VOTE AS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY TO REGAIN CONTROL OF OUR FUTURES
EVENTS ARE BEING HELD AROUND THE WORLD TO CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF THE LABOUR M.P. JOE COX WHO WAS KILLED IN BURSTALL IN WEST YORKSHIRE LAST WEEK HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL GATHER LATER TODAY OR TRAFALGAR SQUARE IN LONDON A LOT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER FORTY SECOND BIRTHDAY
NORTH KOREA'S NEIGHBOURS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN AT TWO MISSILE TESTS CARRIED OUT IN DEFIANCE OF U.N. SANCTIONS SOUTH KOREA DESCRIBED THE LAUNCH OF WHAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE MEDIUM RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILES AS A PROVOCATION JAPAN SAID IT WAS INTOLERABLE
A ROCKET HAS BLASTED OFF FROM INDIA CARRYING TWENTY SATELLITES A RECORD FOR THE COUNTRY SPACE AGENCY THE SATELLITES WILL SERVE VARIOUS PURPOSES INCLUDING MONITORING GREENHOUSE GASES AND DETECTING FOREST FIRES
THE PITCH WOULD INQUIRY INTO UNDERCOVER POLICING IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL HOLD A SPECIAL SESSION AN INVESTIGATION HAS FOUND THAT UNDERCOVER OFFICERS USE THE IDENTITIES OF DEAD CHILDREN THE SESSION WILL CONSIDER WHETHER THE STATE HAS A DUTY TO DISCLOSE WHO THE CHILDREN WERE
DOCTORS LEADERS MEETING IN BELFAST HAVE SAID THAT THE CURRENT LIMIT OF ONE WEEK WHEN EMPLOYEES CONSIGN THEMSELVES OFF WORK WITHOUT NEEDING A SICK NOTE FROM THEIR G.P. SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO TWO WEEKS THEY SAY THIS WOULD HELP TO RELIEVE THE GROWING WORKLOAD FACED BY DOCTORS
TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN OFFICIALLY BEGAN JUST OVER TWO MONTHS AGO YES IT SEEMS LONGER AND IT ENDS TONIGHT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO TALK TO AS WIDE A RANGE OF PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE ON THIS PROGRAMME PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND WE'RE ENDING IT ON A GROUP OF VOTERS WE BROUGHT TOGETHER REPRESENTING A WIDE RANGE OF AGES JOBS AND ATTITUDE WE MET IN THE TOWN HALL IN READING IN BERKSHIRE ON MONDAY MOST HAVE MADE UP THEIR MINDS HOW THEY'D VOTE AND I ASKED THEM WHY
MY MAIN THING WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS IS THE FACT THAT THE E.U. IS GEARED AROUND BIG BUSINESS IT'S LOBBIED BY BIG BUSINESS IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING THINGS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING EVERYTHING A CENTIMETRE WIDE
WHEREAS THE REALITY IS NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF BUSINESSES ARE SMALL BUSINESSES THEY'RE LITTLE BUSINESSES AND I WANT TO SEE THREE BUTCHERS ON THE HIGH STREET I WANT TO SEE A VARIETY PACK SO WE CAN ALL GET GOOD AT CERTAIN THINGS AND THE ECONOMY THEN THRIVES
AND YOU DON'T THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTRY AS IT IS NOW AND AS IT WAS WHEN YOU WERE A YOUNGSTER NOT THAT I'M SUGGESTING YOU'RE BY ANY MEANS YOU DON'T THINK THE COUNTRY'S DONE ALL RIGHT
SOME PEOPLE HAVE DONE A RIGHT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NOT GONE ALL RIGHT MY ONE REASON IS TO REMAIN AS PART OF THE TEAM TO INFLUENCE FROM WITHIN RATHER THAN FROM THE OUTSIDE WE ARE CITIZENS OF THE WORLD AND TO THINK THAT WE CAN
GO AND TAKE A RETROSPECTIVE STEP FROM GOING BACK FORTY YEARS AND JUST BECOME BRITAIN AGAIN
I THINK HIS HOLY IN SAUDI WRONG FOR ME IT IS ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY AND DEMOCRACY WE HAVE TO WRITE AT THE MOMENT EVERY FOUR YEARS TO ELECT A GOVERNMENT AND WE CAN DE SELECT THEM
IF WE DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY DO UNFORTUNATELY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE ARE BEING DICTATED TO BY TWENTY EIGHT COMMISSIONERS MOST OF WHOM WERE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE IDEA THAT WE VOTE THESE ANY PEAS IN THEY'LL REALLY JUST WINDOW DRESSING THEY DON'T REALLY MAKE THE LAWS THEY DON'T HAVE A SAY AND FOR ME SOVEREIGNTY SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD
JUST GIVE IT UP IN THE HOPES THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A FEW PERCENTAGE G.D.P. GROWTH IT'S WORTH FAR MORE THAN THAT HOW MUCH IS DEMOCRACY WORSE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE FOUGHT AND DIED FOR
AS SOMEONE WHO'S GROWN UP IN THE WORLD THAT'S LIKE WITHIN THE ING I OWED NINETEEN
I SEE THE COUNTRY LIKE THROUGH GLOBALISATION AND OTHER THINGS WERE MORE EUROPEANISED I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BAD THING NECESSARILY THE WORLD NEEDS TO BECOME MORE LIKE
TOGETHER IN OUR OPINIONS AND OUR PICTURES AND TO FACE CHALLENGES BECAUSE THERE'S MORE PROBLEMS FACING OUT ALLOWED WE NEED TO START WORKING TOGETHER AND SEEING OURSELVES AS CITIZENS OF THE LARGE ARDEN CITIZENS OF ONE PARTICULAR STATE I RUN A RECRUITMENT BUSINESS AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL THAMES VALLEY CHAMBER
MY POINT OF VIEW IS WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO HIRE PEOPLE IN OUR LOCAL AREA WHO WORK WITH THE NUMBER OF YOU KNOW LARGE BUSINESSES WHICH ARE BASED HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE HAVING THE EUROPEAN ACCORDS HERE MICROSOFT ORACLE EXCEPT YOU'RE SUCH A
THAT HAS A GREAT TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT FOR OUR ECONOMY WITHIN THE LOCAL AREA AND WE WERE VERY WEALTHY DYNAMIC FAST GROWING ECONOMY IN THIS IN THIS AREA BUT THEY'D STILL BE ABLE TO COME IN WHETHER WE WERE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OR NOT THEY IT WOULD BE AND I THINK IT WAS THAT THREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE ALLOWS US EASILY TO CARSON THAT WIDE FOR THE COMPANIES THAT WE WORK WITH BOTH IN LONDON READING
THROUGHOUT EUROPE IN ORDER TO FIND THE BEST TALENT AVAILABLE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY COMPANIES COME TO THIS AREA SO THEY CAN FIND THE BEST TALENT AVAILABLE THE SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES NINETY NINE PER CENT WHICH DON'T EVEN TRADE WITH THE E.U. MY DICK BELIEVE A LOT OF THE ECONOMY PARTICULAR THAMES VALLEY THIS IS BASEBALL
THE WEALTH AND THE TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT OF THE BIG BUSINESSES AND THE SUCCESS WE HAVE IN THIS LOCAL AREA SO MANY LARGE BUSINESSES WOULD ARGUE THAT THE E.U. IT ISN'T GOOD FOR THEM THAT'S THE POINT IT'S VERY GOOD FOR BIG BUSINESSES ARE NOT SO GOOD FOR THE SELF EMPLOYED AND FOR THE SMALL IMMEDIATE CRISIS WHO HAT HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE LAWS
BRUSSELS EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T EVEN TRADE WITH THE LAWS OF THE LAWS OF THIS LAND HERE YOU DOESN'T SET OUR LAWS ALL LAWS COMING OUT OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE TO BE PUT THROUGH OUR OWN PARLIAMENT IT'S NOT TRUE THAT FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF OUR LAWS ARE MADE BY MY LIGHT BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE ISN'T THERE WE ARE TERRY LAWS AND REGULATIONS ACTUALLY MORE BROADLY ARE ANY OF YOU SWAYED BY THE MOOR
PROFOUND ASPECTS OF BEING IN YOUR DEATHS TO SAY SOME OF US OR ONE OF US ANYWAY REMEMBERS THE LAST WAR WAS ALLOWED DURING IT BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE OLD EUROPE WAS LIKE EVEN IF WE WEREN'T THERE WE WE KNOW IS
VERY VERY IMPORTANT MY GRANDMOTHER IT IS VOTING REMAINED FOR THAT REASON SHE'S SHE SAYS I'LL TALK TO HER ABOUT IT BUT SHE FEELS THAT
SINCE WE'VE BEEN PART OF EUROPE AND SHE DOESN'T WANT TO RETURN TO HOW IT WAS WITH THE FIRST AND SECOND WORLD WAR SHE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER OPINION COVERED IN THAT'S WHAT HE FELT AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S IMPORTANT
POINT FOR ME I THINK AS WELL YOU TALK ABOUT THE THE HIGHER IDEALS IT'S IMPORTANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE TO BE PROUD OF WHAT YOU ARE TO TO WORK WITHIN THE GROUP AND TRIED TO TO CHANGE THAT I THINK FROM MY POINT OF VIEW ALTHOUGH I
DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE STAYING HERE AND WILL BE VOTING LAVE BUT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THAT PHILOSOPHICAL BRINGING NATIONS TOGETHER I THINK STILL CAN BE ACHIEVED EVEN OUTSIDE TO FEE AND A FAT POTENTIALLY ACHIEVED BETTER WITHOUT THE BUREAUCRACY OF THE
BRINGING EUROPE TOGETHER BRING IN THE WORLD TOGETHER ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT PROCESS AND THE OVERARCHING IDEALS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OR WHATEVER IT'S ABOUT EDUCATION
EDUCATION CAN HAPPEN AT ANY LEVEL AND I THINK AS WE'VE BECOME MORE EDUCATED WE'VE BECOME MORE HUMANE WERE LESS LIKELY TO FIGHT THE EDUCATION THAT'S HAPPENING THAT DOES IT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT FROM WITHIN THE
LET ME ASK EACH OF YOU IF YOU LIKE TO PUT THE ARGUMENT FOR THE CASE THAT YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN THAT IT'S A SAFE YOU REMAINDERS CAN YOU SEE ANY REASON WHY WE SHOULD LEAVE
A LOT OF GOOD AS COME IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR INSTANCE IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE IN A SAFE WORKPLACE I GO ALONG WITH ELEMENTS OF IT THOSE THINGS DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THAT'S BEEN GROWTH THROUGHOUT EUROPE YOU MADE THINGS BETTER FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE
YOU GO TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND ON BAMBOO STICKS WE KNOW HELMETS ETCETERA UP ON HIS FEET IN THE AIR CAN BE CRAZY SO THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD THINGS BUT I I I'M I'M A SMALL BUSINESS PERSON
SO I LIKE TO HAVE OPTIONS I LIKE TO HAVE CHOICES AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY AND INVOKE FOR EUROPE IS ABOUT HAVING UNIFORMITY AND EVERYBODY BEING THE SAME AND THAT'S FINE THAT'S DONNA'S DISH
ANYBODY ELSE WHO WAS A LEVER MOOSE AARON SEE THE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF TRADE AND I THINK WHEN WE VOTED FOR THE COMMON MARKET THAT WAS A GOOD THING AND IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO TRADE TARIFF FREE WITH OUR FRIENDS IN EUROPE
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE E.U. IS NOW IT'S BECOME SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT IT'S BECOME SOMETHING THAT ONCE CLOSER POLITICAL INTEGRATION AND THAT REALLY WORRIES ME AND IF YOU ARE LEAVING
CAN YOU SEE ANY REASON WHY WE SHOULD REMAIN WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT BOTH SIDES YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE HAVING MORE CONTROL A POINTS BASED SYSTEM COULD WORK YOU HAVING MORE CONTROL OVER THE LEGISLATIONS WE MAKE IN THE WORKPLACE COULD WORK
FOR ME IT'S STILL REMAIN FOR ME THE ONE WORRYING ASPECT IS AND I DO APPRECIATE US HIS INDEPENDENCE HOW MUCH WE CAN DO BY OURSELVES AND HOW MUCH WE CAN DO WITHIN THE E.U. OF GOSSIPY LEFT WE WOULD BE MORE INDEPENDENT AND TO MAKE OUR OWN DECISIONS SO YES IF YOU STAY WITHIN EUROPE WE WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WE WILL HAVE TO COMPROMISE BUT SUCH IS LIFE I PREFER TO STAY WITHIN EUROPE NEGOTIATING COMPROMISE THEN TAKE THE RISK AND GO IT ALONE
WELL THERE WE ARE THE VOICES OF SOME VOTERS IN READING WE SHALL BE HEARING THE VOICE OF DAVID CAMERON AT TEN PAST EIGHT PARTNER TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND WE TURN TO THE PAPERS WHICH ARE ALL DOING WHAT THEY CAN ON THE DAY BEFORE THE REFERENDUM TO MAKE A FINAL APPEALED READERS TO VOTE LEAVE OR REMAIN AND ALONGSIDE A PICTURE OF BIG BEN THE DAILY MAIL TELLS READERS IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN ON THE ONE HAND LIES AND GREEDY ELITES OR ON THE OTHER A GREAT FUTURE OUTSIDE OF BROKEN DYING EUROPE IF YOU BELIEVE IN BRITAIN IT SAYS VOTE LEE
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH TELLS DAVID CAMERON THAT UNLIKE HIM THE BABY BOOM BOOM A GENERATION TOOK PART IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE REFERENDUM WHEN THEY VOTED TWO TO ONE IN FAVOUR OF WHAT WAS THEN THE COMMON MARKET THEY'VE SEEN IT CHANGE BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION AND DECIDED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS THAT WE'RE BETTER OFF OUT THERE SON PRINCE A HUGE CLOSE UP OF DAVID CAMERON AND TELLS READERS LOOK INTO HIS EYES AND THEN MAKE SURE YOU VOTE LEAVE
IT SAYS TOMORROW'S VOTE IT'S OUR ONE CHANCE TO ESCAPE AND BE PART OF THE REAL WORLD MISTER CAMERON SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF IN THE GUARDIAN IN AN INTERVIEW HE SAYS HE HOPES TO BE ABLE TO RETURN TO BRUSSELS AFTER REMAIN BOAT TO PUSH FOR MORE REFORM AROUND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THE TIMES LEE'S ON THE LETTER THAT HE'D PUBLISHER'S TODAY SIGNED BY THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMPANY BOSSES BACKING E.U. MEMBERSHIP IT WOULD BE WISE THE PAPER SAYS TO TAKE THE ADVICE OF MOST BUSINESS LEADERS IN THE ENGINE ROOM OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY AND VOTE TO REMAIN
FROM ALL THAT AT THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WARNS PEOPLE LOOKING FOR WORK ABOUT A NEW SCAM AND WHICH SO CALLED MYSTERY SHOPPER WEBSITES PERSUADE THEM TO SHOPLIFT FOR STORES TELLING THEM THEY'VE BEEN HIRED TO TEST SECURITY THE STOLEN GOODS AND HAVE TO BE PASSED ON TO THE FIRM THE SCAN CAME TO LIGHT AFTER A WOMAN ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING IN BOOTS EXPLAINED TO THE POLICE THAT SHE WAS WORKING UNDERCOVER GOODS CONFIRM THAT THEY DON'T USE SUCH METHODS AND POLICE WARN THAT LETTERS FROM THE COMPANY TO JOB APPLICANTS APPEAR AT FIRST GLANCE TO BE JENNY
FINALLY WHAT'S THE WEATHER GOING TO BE LIKE FOR THE REFERENDUM ACCORDING TO THE EXPRESS A BLAST OF HOT AIR FROM SPAIN WILL MAKE IT THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR SO FAR LEADING TO MUGGY CONDITIONS AT POLLING STATIONS THE TELEGRAPH FORECASTS A SILVER LINING FOR LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS THE MET OFFICE SAYS IT IS PREDICTING THUNDERSTORMS WHICH COULD MEAN A LOWER VOTER TURNOUT PULSES APPARENTLY BELIEVE THAT MATT WILL GIVE THE MORE DETERMINED THAT LEVER VOTE AS THE ADVANTAGE
THE TIME NINETY MINUTES TO WAIT FOR THE WORLD'S GREATEST VIOLINS WERE MADE CENTURIES AGO FROM A COMBINATION OF SPRUCE WILLOW AND MAPLE IN FUTURE THEY WILL BE MADE FROM SPIDERS' SILK THREAD FROM SILKWORMS HELD TOGETHER BY RESIN WILL MAYBE THAT'S EXAGGERATING IT A WEE BIT BUT HERE IN THE STUDIO WE HAVE ONE THAT HAS BEEN MADE WITH THOSE COMPONENTS WE ALSO
HAVE THE MAN WHO MADE IT LUCA ALICE ENTERING E. WHO STUDIES OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON AND THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF ART AND THE VIOLINIST JOANNA BERNHARDT LUCA THAT'S OBVIOUS QUESTION WHY DID YOU WANT TO MAKE A VIOLIN OUT OF SPIDER SILK
I WANT TO TESSIE DE PROPERTIES OF THESE MATERIAL THAT IS A VERY SPECIAL MATERIAL AND I STARTED MY PROJECT AT EXPLORING THE ACOUSTIC PROPERTIES OF BY YOU MY US SIX MONTHS AGO IT SOUNDS A VERY ODD THING TO WANT TO DO BUT IT'S WORKED
YEAH DEFINITELY WE CAN JUDGE FOR OURSELVES WHETHER IT'S WORK AREN'T WE BECAUSE WE CAN HEAR THEM PLAY AND THEN YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO US A LITTLE BIT MORE SO YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND A TRADITIONAL WHILE YOUR OWN VIOLIN WHICH IS MADE OF WOOD YES SO LET'S LISTEN TO THAT ONE OF THEM THEN WE'LL PLAY THE OTHER ONE MAKE A JUDGEMENT GO ON
RIGHT AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY THE SAME TELL US WHAT YOU WERE PLAYING I AM PLAYING AN EX HEAD OF THE D. MINOR BUS ON OUR SOLAR VIOLIN THE SECOND MOVEMENT IS RIGHT AND YOU'LL DO EXACTLY THE SAME ON THE SILK YES WELL OWN SPIDER SILK AND SILK WORM
VIOLINS WHICH LOOKS WELL WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN A SECULAR GO ON OFF YOU GO
RIGHT SO LET ME ASK YOU YOUR VIEW ON THAT AS A PROFESSIONAL VIOLINIST WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER THAT'S A HORRIBLE QUESTION TO ASK IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LATE BUT GO ON IT'S A HARD QUESTION OBVIOUSLY IT'S I FEEL LIKE IT'S A PROTOTYPE AND THERE IS ANOTHER PROTOTYPE AS WELL SO I'VE HEARD THE DIFFERENCE HE CAN
MAIS EN KEN THAT CAN BE MADE ALREADY JUST USING MORE OR LESS ON DIFFERENT MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT YOU'D INSTANTLY SPOT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAYING ABOUT AND PLAYING YOUR WOODEN YES IT'S A BIT HEAVIER BUT THE SOUND THE SOUND IS IT DOESN'T PROJECT AS FAR AS MY WOODS AND ONE DOES AND THE PURITY OF IT
PURITY IS ALSO I THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING AND SOUNDS A BIT LIKE A LITTLE BIT LIKE A VIOLA MOYA GOING TO SIZE BEDS STEVE IT DOES HAVE A BIT OF THAT
THE REALLY HEAVY LOWER REGISTER WHICH WHICH I ASSOCIATE WITH THE VIOLA BUT YOU'RE NOT DISMISSING IT YOU'RE NOT NO I'M NOT DISMISSING IT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IF IF THIS CAN BE PERFECTED IN A WAY THAT IT SOUNDS REALLY VERY CLOSE TO AN OLD A GOOD WOODEN VIOLENCE OF REALLY INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT LOADS OF PEOPLE LIKE TO COPY THEIR OLD VIOLINS
SO YOU CAN HAVE A BACK UP AND SO THEY CAN TRAVEL WITH THAT MAYBE ISN'T AS EXPENSIVE AND SO WOULD BE A I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BE A REALLY INTERESTING THING THE CHOICE BETWEEN THAT AND THE STRENGTH OF OURS YOU PROBABLY GO FOR US YEAH BUT IT HAS A PUPPY OF MY STRADIVARIUS SILK VERSION I WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING AND LOOK AT ARE YOU ABLE TO AS IT WERE OR JUST THE SOUND DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH SPIDERS' SILK YOU PUT IN OR HOW MUCH SILKWORM SILK YOU PUT IN
ABSOLUTELY YES THAT WAS THE MAIN GOAL OF THE PROJECT BEEN ABLE TO DO MORE STREET THAT CHANGING THE PROPERTIES OF THE ACOUSTIC PROPERTIES OTHER MATTHEW DELIS POSSIBLE ENGINEERING AT THE MATERIAL ITSELF AND SO ALSO CHANGING THE PROPERTIES OF A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT OR EVEN OF A SPEAKER OF AND HAD PHONES OR ANY OTHER OBJECT THAT IS ACOUSTICALLY RELATED AND OBVIOUSLY SHOULD MAKE THE POINT THAT IT'S HELD TOGETHER AS IT WERE BY ROSLYN
WELL YES OBVIOUSLY STARTED AS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT SO I DID A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE DEPT GAUL I TRIED TO
A TUDOR PROPERTY IS THAT RESULT AND THE AMOUNT OF CLEARLY THERE'S MORE SILK FROM SILKWORMS IN IT THAN THERE IS SPIDER SILK
ABSOLUTELY S. SPIDER SILK IS ON THE INCREASE TRANCE THIRTY FIVE INTIMATE AS LONG AS LANK OF VIOLIN BODY AND THEY ARE ONLY A FEW MILLIMETRES RUGBY ANOTHER BUT THE THING ABOUT IT OF COURSE IS THAT IT'S IMMENSELY STRONG ISN'T IT IMMENSELY POWERFUL ABSOLUTELY IS A VERY SPECIAL MATERIAL HE IS VERY STRONG SO HE'S ABLE TO BALANCE DEATH THE SYSTEM THE COMPLEX SYSTEM OF STRESSES THAT COST THE ACTING ON ABOUT ON EM
VERY GOOD YEAH WELL AND I THOUGHT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE MORE
YEAH I THINK SO I DEFINITELY WANT TO CARRY ON WITH MASS PRODUCTION ACTUALLY NOW I THINK THAT THE SORT OF LET'S SAY APPROACH NEED TO DEAL BE VERY CLOSE TO THE CUSTOMISED B.C. ALL RIGHT FOR THE MOMENT JOURNEY YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING YOUR WITH ONE AS WELL
YES WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED HONOUR BERNHARDT LUCA ALICE AND RENEE THANK YOU THANK YOU FORTY MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER THIS MORNING'S CANNON ALGAE ANGELA TELL B. OF CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL THE MORNING GOOD MORNING WE'RE JUST PAST THE SUMMER SOLSTICE THE LONGEST DAY OF THE YEAR WHICH COINCIDED THIS YEAR WITH THE JUNE FULL MOON THE STRAWBERRY MOON AS IT'S CALLED
FROM NOW ON THE DAYS WILL GET SHORTER AND TO THEM UNTIL THE WINTER SOLSTICE IN DECEMBER I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS ON A CATHEDRAL CALENDAR SEEMED HELPER FEASTS AND PASS OF THE CHURCH FIT ROUND THE EVER CHANGING HERE I COULD BORE ON ABOUT THIS FOR HOURS BECAUSE MAKING THE LITURGY WORK FOR REAL SERVICES OF WORSHIP IN REAL TIME FASCINATES ME THE CHRISTIAN CALENDAR LIKE THAT OF JEWS AND MUSLIMS DEPENDS A LOT ON THE MOON
BUT SOME IMPORTANT DAYS DEPEND ON THE SUN THE SUMMER SOLSTICE IS MARKED BY THE FEAST OF THE BIRTH OF JOHN THE BAPTIST WHICH FALLS TOMORROW AND THE WINTER SOLSTICE COMES JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS
SO JOHN THE FORERUNNER OF JESUS'S REPRESENTED BY THE FADING OF THE SUN'S LIGHT CHRISTMAS BY THE BIRTH OF NEW LIGHT SO FAITH FITS AT SEASONS AROUND CYCLE OF NATURE THE THINGS HAVE TIME POINT TO THE THINGS OF ETERNITY
THEY ALWAYS FEEL MILDLY SAD WHEN HE PASSED THE SUMMER SOLSTICE ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR WHEN AND SOUTHERN BRITAIN THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH CLOUD AND RAIN LIVING IN SOUTH OXFORD IT SEEMS TO ME WE'VE HARDLY SEEN THE SUN AT ALL AND SOON THE AISLES OF SUNLIGHT WILL BE NOTICEABLY FEWER YET THE GRASS IS LUSH THE BERRIES AND FRUIT ARE GROWING IN MY GARDEN THE WEAK SUN IN THE DRIVING RAIN HAVE DONE THEIR STUFF
THERE'S THAT IN ALL OF US WHICH STRUGGLES WITH THYME WHICH LONGS FOR A BIT OF PERMANENCE AND STABILITY
ARISTOTLE TAUGHT THAT EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WERE SEEKING A POINT OF REST BUT ISAAC NEWTON PROVED THE OPPOSITE NOTHING AT THAT REST EVERYTHING MOVES ALL THE TIME
THE PLANETS ROUND THE SUN THE EARTH ON ITS AXIS THE MOON ROUND THE EARTH THE ELECTRON AROUND THE ATOM NOTHING IS FIXED FOR EVER YET IT IS CONTINUITY THE CYCLE REPEATS IT IT'S NEVER EXACTLY THE SAME
NEWTON THOUGHT THE UNIVERSE RAN LIKE CLOCKWORK BUT MORE RECENT SCIENCE SEES THE IRREGULARITIES AND HOW THEY PRODUCE VARIETY LIKE THE SEASONS AND TIDES AND THE OCCASIONAL STRAWBERRY MOON
EVEN THE BLOOMIN HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN YOU GET TWO FULL MOONS IN A SINGLE MONTH THERE'S NO PERMANENCE TO CLING TO WE HAVE TO SURF THEIR WAY FOR RIDE THE TIDE DO THE BEST FOR THE TIMES WE LIVE IN THE CHANCES WE GET BECAUSE THEY WON'T COME AGAIN
WE CAN NEVER KNOW THE FUTURE EVEN OUR BEST PREDICTIONS ARE PARTIAL YET FAITH OFFERS ME THE RESOURCE TO LIVE CREATIVELY IN TIME THE IT FOR THIS WEEK IN THE ANGLICAN CALENDAR POINTS US BEYOND OURSELVES ASKING THAT WE MAY SO PASSED THROUGH THE THINGS OF TIME THAT WE LOSE NOT FOR THINGS OF ETERNITY
A PRAYER FOR ALL TIMES AND ALL SEASONS
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH CANNON AND YOU LIKE HE'LL BE THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT ELLIE BUTLER'S LIFE WAS SHORT SHE WAS SIX YEARS OLD WHEN SHE WAS KILLED BY HER FATHER BEN BUTLER WHO WAS TOLD YESTERDAY HE'LL GO TO PRISON FOR AT LEAST TWENTY THREE YEARS HER MOTHER WAS CONVICTED OF COVERING UP THE CRIME AND GIVEN FORTY TWO MONTHS BUT THIS IS MORE THAN A CASE OF BAD PEOPLE DOING AWFUL THINGS AFTER SHE WAS FIRST ABUSED ANY LIVED WITH HER GRANDPARENTS FOR FIVE YEARS
IN TWENTY TWELVE SHE WAS RETURNED TO HER PARENTS BUT THEIR CONVICTION THE ORIGINAL CONVICTION FOR ABUSE WAS QUASHED BY THE APPEAL COURT AND THE FAMILY COURT JUDGE MISSUS JUSTICE HOG DECIDED THAT BUTLER HAD BEEN EXONERATED NOT ONLY DID THE JUDGE SEND HER LITTLE GIRL BACK BUT SHE ORDERED THAT THE SOCIAL SERVICES HAD TO HAND THE CASE OVER TO PRIVATE CONTRACTORS AND EVERY PUBLIC BODY HAD TO BE TOLD THAT BUTLER HAD BEEN EXONERATED
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO ANY BUTLER'S GRANDFATHER NEIL GRAY AND I ASKED HIM FIRST TO PAINT A PICTURE OF HOW LIFE WAS WHEN I WAS LIVING WITH THEM WHAT SHE WAS LIKE FANTASTIC
SHE WAS VERY BUBBLY BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL ON THE GO ALL THE TIME
LOTS OF ENERGY LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN HOUSE VERY BRINING NOBODY'S FOAL IT WAS IT WAS THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE
AND DID ELLIE WOOD DID SHE MAKE IT CLEAR DURING THE TIME THAT SHE WAS WITH YOU THAT SHE WANTED TO BE WITH YOU FOREVER
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS MILLIONS THAT'S WHAT OUR OWN SMALLS TO MY WIFE WHEN SHE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WANTED TO STAY YES WELL WE WE PRESUME NOT BEING SPECIAL GUARDIANS YOU HAD OWNED SAUDI AGE OF EIGHTEEN WE TREATED HER LIKE OUR OWN DAUGHTER AND THEN BEN BUTLER
WENT TO COURT AND MADE THE EFFORT TO GET HER BACK THE EFFORT THAT WAS EVENTUALLY TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN IT WENT TO COURT HOW HARD DID YOU FIGHT TO KEEP HER
AS HARD AS WE TOURED I WOULD A PERIOD FROM SO OH NO I AIN'T HAD TO TRAIN FOR TO ELEVEN TO TWENTY TWELVE
ENSURE ELEVEN NEAR LOCAL AUTHORITY ASKED MY WIFE AND I WE WOULD LIKE TO ADOPT EARLY BECAUSE WE WE PASSED ALL THE CRITERIA AND OLDE JUMPED IN THROUGH THE HOPES THAT ONE HAS TO DO TO BECOME AN ADOPT A AND WE PUT AN APPLICATION IN TO THE DOCTOR
BUT HER SOCIAL WORKER BLOCKED IT VICE PARENTS AND WE WERE GOING TO A DOCTOR ALI AND THE APPLICATION WAS STOP
IT WAS WE WERE BACKED BY THE LONDON BOROUGH OF SUTTON CHILDREN SERVICES TO ADOPT ALI AND WHEN IT CAME TO COURT WHAT DID YOU SAY HOW MUCH OF A STRUGGLE WAS IT TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE COURT THAT YOU WERE RIGHT
WE FOUND IT VERY DEVASTATING WE WE TRY TO FIGHT IT TOOTH AND NAIL BUT EVERY TIME WE
WE PROTESTED WE WERE TOLD WE WERE TROUBLE MITRES ON WE WERE ELDERLY PEOPLE ON THE WAY WE WEREN'T WORTHY
OF LOOKING AFTER CHILDREN IS IT TRUE THAT YOU TOLD MISSUS JUSTICE HARK THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BLOOD ON HER HANDS IF ANYONE
YES IT IS I SAID I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A CONSCIENCE OR SO BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU MIGHT HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS WITH REGARDS TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER ELLIE WHY DID THEY GET IT SO WRONG ALL THOSE PEOPLE
I DON'T THINK THEY ERM I THINK I WANTED A QUICK FIX IF YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT I DON'T THINK THEY WERE THAT INTERESTING
THE LOCAL AUTHORITY FORK TRUTH ALTO BACK MYSELF OR MY WIFE WHO'S NOW DEPARTED FROM THIS WORLD TO KEEP ELLIE BUT WE SHE'S CHIPPED JUST USE HOG HOW
IN OUR MINDS BUT WE I THINK THAT WE WERE UNWORTHY TO LOOK AFTER HER
BECAUSE THE HISTORY OF ELLIE SAYING TO HER PARENTS
IVOR A CATALOGUE OF TWO AND A HALF YEARS WE USED TO TAKE ELLIE TO A PLACE CALLED A SAINT OF CHILDREN CENTRE SO PROBLEM FAMILIES HE'S GOING TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN
WE USED THE TIGER EARLY EVERY FORTNIGHT OR EVERY FOURTH THREE TO FOUR WEEKS
AND OVER A PERIOD OF TWO AND A HALF YEARS THE FATHER WENT TWICE AND THE MOTHER WENT FOUR TIMES
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO GO BACK TO HER PARENTS SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY PETRIFIED OF THE SOCIAL WORKERS
SHE TOLD THEM SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK AND AS SHE STARTED TO HOUSE NIGHT TRAINS WHERE SHE WAS SCARED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO COME AND TAKE HER AWAY IN THE NIGHT SHE HAD A HIDIN BEHIND THE CURTAIN OR UNDER THE DOVER EVERY TIME I TURNED UP AT OUR HOUSE
SHE USED TO BE PETRIFIED AND HER MOTHER HAD TURNED ROUND AND SAID TO HER IF YOU DON'T COME BACK AND LIVE WITH MUMMY AND DADDY BEARING IN MIND SHE HADN'T KNOWN
SHE HADN'T SEEN HER FOR TWO AND A HALF MAYBE THREE YEARS ALTOGETHER
SHE DIDN'T KNOW THEM AS PARENTS BUT HER MOTHER SAID IF YOU DON'T COME BACK TO LIVE WITH MUMMY AND DADDY WE WON'T LOVE YOU ANY MORE CAN YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME THEN THAT YOU SAW IT YOU SAID GOODBYE TO HER
I SAW HER ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF OCTOBER THE DAY BEFORE SHE DIED THE MODIFY MY WIFE TWELVE O'CLOCK LUNCH TIME ON THE SUNDAY
AND SAID WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE EARLY SO WE ARRANGED TO MATEY MCDONALD'S IN SUTTON WE'VE GOT THERE FOR ONE O'CLOCK WE HAD HALF AN HOUR TO SAY
AND SHE WASN'T EARLY BUT WE KNOW SHE HAD BRUISES ON HER FOREHEAD AND OFF AND SCRATCHES HER HAIR WAS ALL WE DRY CALLED SHED ODD SHOES ODD SOCKS ARE CLOSE LOOKED AS OLIVER SHOULD BEING DRAGGED THROUGH THE BACK OF THE HATRED
DO YOU CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU LEFT DID SHE DID SHE RESIST GOING BACK WITH HER PARENTS NO BUT YOU SEE YOU COULD SEE HER EYES WERE SON TEAM AND THEY WERE SAYING MISSING ARRIVES EVERY TIME MY WIFE OR I SPOKE TO HER
HER MOTHER WAS LOOKING AT HER IN A LOT
YOU COULD SAY THAT SHE WAS SCARED OR WHATEVER SHE WAS GOING TO SIGH YEAH THE MOTHER WILL COME DOWN IT MY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAPPEN
NOW THE COURT CASE IS OVER A HOAX OF THE SOFA A JUDICIAL SHOWN OR AN ARTICLE SO INFORMALLY
SO YOU WANT A PUBLIC ENQUIRY JUST TO PUT IN A MOMENT STRANDS YOU WANT TO BE I THINK EVERY CASE SURROUND HIM MISSED KAI'S TO FIND OUT WHAT THE JUDICIARY DIDN'T DO DAY JOB CORRECTLY WHY THE SOCIAL SERVICE FILED EARLY ESPECIALLY PRIVATE SIDE I WANT IT ALL OPEN AND THE BATH BALLS I WANT EVERYBODY TO ANSWER COS EVERYBODY FILED EARLY COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY YEAH GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THIS MORNING

BUT SOME SUSPECT COMPANIES ARE USING THE EXEMPTION WHEN THEY DON'T REALLY NEED TO BECAUSE THEY CAN GET MORE MILES PER GALLON FROM THEIR CARS THE LED ZEPPELIN SINGER ROBERT PLANT HAS TOLD A COURT IN LOS ANGELES THAT HE COULD NOT REMEMBER MEETING MEMBERS OF THE BAND WHOSE MUSIC HE AND GUITARIST JIMMY PAGE HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF PLAGIARISING THE PAIR ARE FACING CLAIMS THAT A CHORD SEQUENCE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE HIT STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN WAS TAKEN FROM A TRACK CALLED TAURUS BY THE AMERICAN GROUP SPIRIT
THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT BY THIS TIME TOMORROW MORNING THE FIRST VOTES WILL HAVE BEEN CAST AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE THEY CAMPAIGN LEADERS CAN DO THAN HOPE AND PRAY THAT THEY'VE GOT THEIR MESSAGES ACROSS WE THE PEOPLE WILL END UP DECIDING
BUT THERE'S ONE MAN WHO INEVITABLY CARRIES THE HEAVY BURDEN OF KNOWING THAT IF IT GOES WRONG FOR HIM AND THIS COUNTRY EMBARKS ON FRIDAY MORNING ON A NEW CHAPTER IN ITS HISTORY HE WILL HAVE NOBODY TO BLAME BUT HIMSELF THE MAN WHO CALLED THE REFERENDUM DAVID CAMERON AND HE IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING PRIME MINISTER GOOD MORNING
YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT BRITAIN FACES GRAVE DANGERS IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU BEAR A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT DON'T YOU BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR DECISION TO CALL IT AND CALL IT IN A HURRY
I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO HAVE A REFERENDUM WE HAVEN'T HAD A SAY ON THIS ISSUE SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES EUROPE HAS CHANGED AND I BELIEVE SOME ISSUES ARE SO BIG THAT IT'S RIGHT THAT THE POLITICIANS SAY TO THE PEOPLE IT'S YOUR DECISION HERE ARE THE ARGUMENTS THIS IS WHAT I THINK YOU YOU DECIDE I WOULD
DISPUTE THAT THIS HAS BEEN DONE IN A HURRY I PATIENTLY WENT ROUND EUROPEAN CAPITALS AND NEGOTIATED SOME VERY IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES FOR BRITAIN ENHANCING OUR SPECIAL STATUS WHERE WERE OUT OF THE EURO BUT IN THE SINGLE MARKET WE HAVE THE FREEDOM TO LIVE AND TO TRAVEL AND TOOK TO WORK BUT WE'VE KEPT OUR BORDERS WERE NOT IN THE SHOWING ZONE AND SO NOW WE'RE HOLDING THIS REFERENDUM AND YES I HAVE I THINK SET OUT A VERY POSITIVE CASE THAT WE ARE STRONGER SAFER AND BETTER OFF IF WE STAY
BUT ALSO YES I'VE BEEN VERY FRANK ABOUT THE WARNINGS TO OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE I GENUINELY BELIEVE THEM AND I THINK TODAY WITH OVER A THOUSAND BUSINESSES INCLUDING OVER HALF THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES REPRESENTING ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IN WORK WARNING THAT WILL HAVE MORE JOBS AND MORE GROWTH IF WE STAY IN A LESS IF WE COME OUT
IT REALLY IS WORTH LISTENING TO YOU SAY YOU NEGOTIATED VERY IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES YOU NAME TO THE EURO AND THE SHOWING IN THE ZONE WE WERE NOT IN THE EUROZONE WE WERE NOT IN THE SHOWING ZONE THERE WERE OTHER ADVANTAGES THAT YOU CLAIMED TO HAVE NEGOTIATED TWO OF THEM WERE SIGNIFICANT BY YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT NEITHER OF THEM
TURNS OUT TO BE WORTH VERY MUCH AT ALL LET'S DEAL FIRST OF ALL WITH THE RESTRICTION OF E.U. MIGRANTS ACCESS TO IN WORK BENEFITS DOESN'T ADD UP TO A ROW OF BEANS DOES IT WHAT IT DOES WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT IF PEOPLE COME HERE THEY CAN'T CLAIM UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT IF THEY DON'T FIND IT IF THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB AFTER SIX MONTHS THEY HAVE TO LEAVE IF THEY DO WORK THEY HAVE TO WORK FOR FOUR YEARS BEFORE THEY GET FULL ACCESS TO OUR WELFARE SYSTEM FOR YEARS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING THIS END SOMETHING FOR NOTHING OR MEANS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY IN BEFORE THEY GET OUT BUT I WOULD ARGUE THE OTHER THREE CHANGES THAT I ACHIEVED SAFEGUARDING OUR CURRENCY AND MAKING SURE WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE IN A MINUTE I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU JOHN BUT I DON'T UNDER BY ALL MEANS COME TO THEM IN A MINUTE BUT LET'S JUST DEAL WITH THEM ONE AT A TIME BECAUSE THEN IT'S A BIT LESS CONFUSING BECAUSE I WANTED TO PUT TO YOU WHAT SIR STEPHEN LICKLE A MEMBER OF THE OFFICE OF BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY WHOM YOU OBVIOUSLY RESPECT BECAUSE THEY IN THE BODY
HE WAS ASKED WHAT IMPACT THIS PROPOSED BAN THAT YOU TALK ABOUT INWARD BENEFITS BAN WOULD HAVE ON MIGRATION HE REPLIED I QUOTE THE BEAT HIM NOT MUCH IF YOU READ ON AND HE THEN SAID THAT THEY HADN'T ACTUALLY MODELLED IT THEY HAVEN'T MADE A FORECAST BUT IT STANDS TO SENSE IF YOU'RE SAYING TO PEOPLE TODAY YOU CAN COME TO BRITAIN AND GET TEN THOUSAND POUNDS OF BENEFITS ON TOP OF YOUR WAGES AND IN FUTURE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO
I THINK IT STANDS TO SENSE THAT THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S ABOUT A PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS THEIR NUMBERS WHICH IS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'VE INSURED AT THIS IS ONLY FOR BRITAIN IF YOU COME AND WORK HERE MAKE A CONTRIBUTION WHICH IS WELCOME YOU HAVE TO PAY HIM FOR FOUR YEARS BEFORE YOU GET
FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OUT OF OUR WELFARE SYSTEM THAT'S VERY POSITIVE AND A VERY GOOD MOVE AND I WOULD ARGUE THE OTHER THINGS WE ACHIEVED ON SAFEGUARDING THE PAD ON CUTTING BUREAUCRACY THESE AT GETTING OUT OF EVER CLOSER UNION SOMETHING THAT EUROSCEPTICS HAVE LONG WANTED US TO DO AND BELIEVED WAS IMPOSSIBLE ALL FOUR OF THESE MEASURES ARE IMPORTANT AND WHEN I PUT IT IS THAT BUT WHAT I THINK'S IMPORTANT IS THEY ADD TO THEIR SPECIAL STATUS WE ALREADY HAVE I'M OUT CAMPAIGNING TODAY WITH JOHN MAJOR WHO ACHIEVE
IS THAT VERY IMPORTANT THING OF SAFEGUARDING THE PAIN AND KEEPING US OUT OF THE YEAR IS IT BRITAIN IS LIKE ANY OTHER COUNTRY WE HAVE A DIFFERENT MEMBERSHIP TO OTHERS PRECISELY WITH WHICH IS WHY IT'S SLIGHTLY STRANGE THAT WE SAVE GOD OF POWER WE WEREN'T IN THE EUROZONE BUT LET'S DEAL WITH SOMETHING THAT'S LET ME ANSWER THAT ONE ALL RIGHT QUICKLY BECAUSE THIS WILL MAKE IT QUICK IT HAVE GOT OUT OF THE EURO STAYED OUT OF EUROPE BUT WE WERE AT RISK OF GETTING DRAWN INTO BAIL OUTS FOR THE EURO
AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER WOULD IT NOPE IT SAFEGUARDS THE SITUATION OF THE PAN SO WE GOT OUT OF ANY CHANCE OF HAVING TO BAIL OUT OVER YOUR RESERVE AND CRUCIALLY WE HAVE A GUARANTEE WE ALREADY HANG ON HANG ON HOLD ON HOLD ON THERE WE DIDN'T WE DID NOT HAVE THAT GUARANTEED THAT IS NO GUARANTEE AND THE SECOND THING IS ABSOLUTELY
VITAL THAT WE CAN'T IN ANY WAY BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN'T SAY FOR INSTANCE THAT FINANCIAL SERVICE TRANSACTIONS IN EUROS HAVE TO BE CARRIED OUT IN EUROZONE COUNTRIES THAT'S A VITALLY IMPORTANT SAFEGUARD FINANCIAL SERVICES A SEVEN PER CENT OF OUR ECONOMY TWO THIRDS OF THE JOBS ARE OUTSIDE LONDON IF WE DO WHAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAYS AND LEAVE THE SINGLE MARKET
MANY OF THOSE JOBS WILL BE ALL RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT EVER CLOSER UNION BECAUSE THIS GETS TO THE HEART OF IT DOESN'T IT YOU SEE THAT YOU WON AN EXEMPTION FROM EVER CLOSER UNION WITH YOUR RENEGOTIATION OF THE REALITY IS YOU DIDN'T YOU WON A PROMISE A PROMISE THAT MAY NOT BE
THEY'RE WHAT I WHAT WAS TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT WE'RE OUT OF BRITAIN IS OUT OF EVER CLOSER UNION AND THAT WAS AGREED BY THE TWENTY SEVEN OTHER PRIME MINISTERS AND PRESIDENTS AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THAT WILL THEN BECOME A TREATY CHANGE AND BECOME A TREAT INCH WILL BECOME A TREAT BUT EVEN IF IT DOES BECOME A TREATY CHANGE THOSE LEADERS THAT YOU'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT MAY NOT BE IN POWER AT THE TIME OF THE TREATY IS NEGOTIATED
ALL TWENTY SEVEN AGREED AND THAT THEREFORE FORMS IF WE VOTE TO STAY IN THAT DOCUMENT FORMS A LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT'S DEPOSITED AT THE UN WHO ACHIEVE SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IT SAID FOR THE FIRST TIME THE EUROPEAN COURT CHANGE CANNOT USE EVER CLOSER UNION TO INCREASE CENTRALISATION IN BRUSSELS LIKE THIS IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE RISKS OF STEAK I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE RISKS OF STABLES IF THERE ARE ANY FUTURE PROPOSALS TO TRANSFER POWERS FROM BRITAIN TO BRUSSELS BY LAW WE HAVE TO HAVE A REFERENDUM CHOICE IN THIS REFERENDUM IS VERY CLEAR IF WE STAY IN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO JOBS THE GROWTH BEING PAR LES COME TO THAT IN A MOMENT THE BETTER WE LEAVE THERE ARE REAL RISKS TO OUR ALL RIGHT ME TO A FIGHT FAMILY FINANCES TO WEE ORBS WE'LL COME TO THAT IN A SECOND BILL CAT INCIDENTALLY
WHAT YOU HAVE JUST DESCRIBED AS A SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS WAS A MERE SPECULATIVE HOPE ACCORDED TO BILL CASH LET COURSE HE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO GET US OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SO HE'S BACK AND TO SAY WHAT IS JANET ON THE EUROPEAN SCRUTINY COMMITTEE AND PARLIAMENT AS A VOLUNTEER IN THESE MATTERS BUT ONLY RELIABLE THAT WE HAVE A SPECIAL ALL RIGHT AS WE HAVE THE BEST ALL RIPEN HEARTS THAT THROUGH THAT RENEGOTIATION WE DON'T PUT THAT AT RISK BY LEAVING WE PUT AT RISK OUR ECONOMY AND JOBS AND IT'S ALSO ALL RIGHT LES IS IRREVERSIBLE IF WE TAKE THIS DECISION TOMORROW YOU CAN'T
JUMP OUT OF THE AEROPLANE AND THEN CLAMBER BACK THROUGH MADE THAT POINT VERY FIRMLY LET'S TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION ANOTHER MODE SAY ANOTHER OF YOUR FAILURE YOU FAILED TO GET ANY CONCESSIONS ON THE MOVEMENT OF EUROPEAN UNION CITIZENS THIS IS NOTHING
THIS IS O.K. IT CONCERNS MOST PEOPLE MOST OF THE TIME THAT JOHN AGAIN THAT'S NOT TRUE IF YOU LOOK AT THE RENEGOTIATION SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SORT OUT FOR YEARS ABOUT EXPELLING CRIMINALS ABOUT EXPELLING SHAM MARRIAGES THAT STOPPING PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS AS WELL TO EXPEL CRIMINALS WRONG EVEN HEARTS THAN MASSIVELY THROUGH MAY HAVE BEEN A BIT BUT YOU CANNOT STOP PEOPLE
FROM EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES WHO WANT TO COME TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY COMING HERE AND THAT IS THE CRUCIAL FACT IN THIS BIT OF THE DEBATE IS CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT BRITISH NATIONALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO TO WORK IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND EUROPEAN NATIONALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO COME AND WORK HERE BUT IT'S NOT AN UNQUALIFIED RIGHT IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A JOB IF THEY CAN'T SUPPORT THEMSELVES
THEY HAVE TO LEAVE BUT WHAT I THINK WE LEARNT FROM THAT DEBATE LAST NIGHT IS THAT WE DON'T SOLVE OUR IMMIGRATION CHALLENGED BY LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT WE DO CREATE A MASSIVE PROBLEM FOR OUR ECONOMY IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I THINK AS I SAID THERE ARE GOOD WAYS OF CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION BY WELFARE CHANGES ARE A GOOD WAY THERE ARE BAD THINGS TO DO LEAVING THIS MARKET ARE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION HITTING OUR BUSINESSES GIVING US A DECADE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT THE LEAF CAMPAIGN ADMITTED
IT COULD TAKE TEN YEARS TO NEGOTIATING A TRADE DEAL WITH EUROPE I THINK TAUGHT OUT TRAIN WHEELS AT THE MOMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION SO LET'S LET'S STAY WITH IT FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE THAT IS THAT THE AREA WHERE PEOPLE PERHAPS LEAST TRUST YOU AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS YOU MADE PROMISES THAT PERHAPS YOU KNEW SOME PEOPLE SO YOU KNEW COULD NOT BE KEPT BUT IN EITHER CASE
THEY WERE MADE AS FIRMLY AS WAS POSSIBLE NO IFS NO BUTS A PROMISE WE MADE OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE A PROMISE WE ARE KEEPING YOU SAID THE SAME SORT OF THING THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONFERENCE I KNOW YOU WANT THIS SORTED I WILL NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER AND YOU DID
I DIDN'T BECAUSE I ACHIEVE THOSE VERY IMPORTANT CHANGE WHAT I DO I WAS A BIT OF THE WELFARE CHANGES OF DIRECTLY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION BUT LET ME ADDRESS AND IN ANY DRESS WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR QUEST A NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY TO LIVE AND EVERYTHING IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE IN YOUR QUESTION YOU IMPLIED THAT SOMEHOW WENT STEVE HILTON WAS WORKING AT DOWNING STREET FOR INSTANCE THAT WE KNEW WE WEREN'T GOING TO HIT THIS TARGET SIMPLY NOT TRUE WHEN STEVE HILTON LEFT DOWNING STREET YOU MADE IT UP
IF YOU GIVE ME TWO SECONDS WHEN HE LEFT SHE IMMIGRATION NET MIGRATION WAS FALLING FROM AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIRST A THIRD OF A MILLION OF THEM WHICH WAS IT'S YOUR LITTER UP YOURSELF IN A MINUTE JOHN IF YOU DON'T WATCH IT AND THE TART AND THE FORECAST AT THAT POINT WAS THAT WE WOULD BE MEETING
THE TARGET WE HAD I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD COS PEOPLE LISTENING TO YOUR PROGRAMME YESTERDAY WOULD HAVE GOT VERY MUCH THE WRONG IMPRESSION BECAUSE I SAY LOOK THERE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION AND WERE DOING THEM AND HALF OF IMMIGRATION IS FROM OUTSIDE THE EEL WE SHOULD BE WATER ADDRESS THAT BUT THE WRONG THING TO DO IS LEAVE THE SINGLE MARKET DAMAGE OUR ECONOMY DAMAGE BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE A VERY BAD OUTCOME NOT JUST FOR A HOLIDAY BUT FOR FAMILIES
AND FOR BUSINESSES AND FOR JOHN ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THIS REFERENCE EXACTLY WHY DID YOU PUT A FIGURE BUT TENS OF THOUSANDS CAR ON THAT PROMISE OF YOURS IN TWENTY TEN BECAUSE IT COULDN'T BE KEPT YOU NOW KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT COULDN'T BE KEPT ISN'T THE REALITY THAT YOU MADE THAT PROMISE BECAUSE IT WAS POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT TO DO SO INDEED YOU MAY WELL HAVE WON THE ELECTION ON THE BACK OF IT I THINK IT IS THE RIGHT AMBITION FOR BRITAIN AND JOHN AS RECENTLY AS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SITUATION OF BRITISH PEOPLE AND EUROPEAN NATIONALS LEAVING BRITAIN TO GO TO EUROPE AND EUROPEAN NATIONALS COMING TO BRITAIN THERE WAS ACTUALLY NET NEGATIVE MIGRATION IN TERMS OF EUROPE SO I REPEATED IT A THIRD OF THE MILLING HERE AND THAT IS THE POINT WE'VE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY FIVE YEAR PERIOD WHERE WE'VE CREATED MORE JOBS THAN THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION PUT TOGETHER THAT IS NOT A NORMAL PERIOD BUT THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE STRONG BUT ABSOLUTELY AND I ALSO WANT TO COME I ALSO SEE
THAT THE EUROZONE ECONOMIES ARE RECOVERING YOU SAW GROWTH OF SEVEN PER CENT IN IRELAND LAST YEAR YOU SEE SPAIN GREAT FOX FRANCE GERMANY GROWING SO THEY SLOVENIA FRUTTA IF WE'VE HAD AN UNNATURAL PERIOD AS I SAY I THINK IT'S OF THAT IMPORTANT POINT AS RECENTLY AS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT EUROPEAN MIGRATION WAS IN BALANCE AND SO WE NEEDED TO DO MORE TO CONTROL MIGRATION WELL OUTSIDE THE E.U. SO IT'S NOT IT'S HOPE IT'S THE RIGHT AMBITION IT'S NOT AN UNREALISTIC AMBITION WELL THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO TO ACHIEVE THAT AMBITION
BUT WE SHOULDN'T LEAVE THE E.U. ON THE BASIS OF IT BECAUSE IF WE LEFT THE SINGLE MARKET WE DUE TO OUR ECONOMY COULD BUSINESS IT'S A NOVEL IDEA ONLY FIND IT'S A NOVEL IDEA THAT WE WE HAVE TO RELY ON GROWTH IN SPAIN TO CUT IMMIGRATION TO THIS COUNTRY
WHAT IS THAT WHAT WE'VE GOT THE AMBITION IS NET MIGRATION AND NET MIGRATION IS OBVIOUSLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE LEAVING THE U.K. TO GO AND WORK IN EUROPE AND PEOPLE FROM EUROPE FROM HER WORK IN THE U.K. THEY ALL ARE RIGHT IF IT'S I DON'T WANT YOU KEEP INTERRUPT SO I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO TARGET THAT MIGRATION COS THAT IS THE BEST INDICATION OF THE SORT OF PRESSURES THAT THE COUNTRY FACES BUT AS I SAY WE'VE HAD AN ABNORMAL PERIOD OF VERY STRONG GROWTH IN BRITAIN AND NO GROWTH IN EUROPE BY AND LARGE
THAT'S CREATE WE'VE CREATED TWO AND A HALF MILLION JOBS I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN PRIME MINISTER TWO THIRDS OF THOSE HAVE GONE TO BRITISH NATIONALS BUT YES PEOPLE HAVE COMMON WORKED HERE AND MADE A CONTRIBUTION BUT THE QUEST WE HAVE TO ASK YOURSELVES IS AS WE MEET THE CHALLENGE OF IMMIGRATION DO WE WANT TO TRY AND MEET IT BY LEAVING THE SINGLE MARKET TANKING OUR ECONOMY HURTING JOBS BUSINESSES AND GROWTH AND FAMILY'S FINANCES
RESTRICTING THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN A COUNTRY WITH A DECADE OF UNCERTAINTY AND A PERMANENTLY WORST TRADING WITH EUROPE OR DO WE WANT TO ACTUALLY FIND SMART WAYS OF MANAGING ALL RIGHT SO WHAT WAS TERESA MAY PROMISING EXACTLY THEN WHEN SHE SAID THERE WOULD BE A RE EXAMINATION OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT DOES I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN EARLIER WE ARE REOPENING THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT DIRECTORS BECAUSE OF THE RENEGOTIATION AND WE'RE GETTING CHANGES CRIMINALS ON THIRD PARTY NATIONALS
ON SHAM MARRIAGES ON A WHOLE SET OF ISSUES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF COURT JUDGEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND WE'VE ACHIEVED THAT AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS IF WE STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION REFORM CONTINUES ON FRIDAY AS WELL AS ON FRIDAY I THINK THEY'RE BEING A REMAIN DIVIDEND THERE'S BUSINESSES AND WEALTH CREATORS AND JOB CREATORS THINK RIGHT GREAT BRITONS MADE ITS DECISION THIS IS A BRILLIANT COUNTRY TO INVEST
I THINK WE'LL SEE A REAL ECONOMIC BONUS FRONT FROM THERE AND WHATEVER THE RESULT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE DECIDED ONE WITHIN THE OTHER THERE WILL BE A DEEP THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE DECIDED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THERE WILL BE A DEEP DIVISION IN THE COUNTRY QUITE CLEARLY HEY THAN BRING HER BACK TOGETHER
I THINK BY EXCEPTING THE RESULT OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE THAT'S THE FIRST THING I THINK THERE'S A CHOICE OF BRIT BRING THE GOVERNMENT TO BACK TOGETHER TO FOCUS ON THE REAL AGENDA THAT WE WANT TO PURSUE WHICH IS TAKING THE STRENGTH OF OUR ECONOMY WHICH I THINK WILL BE BOOSTED BY REMAIN VOTE AND MAKING SURE WE CAN THEN INCREASE THEIR LIFE CHANCES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY I THINK THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS PROGRAMME WHO
THAT FEAR FOR INSECURITY IF WE LEAVE BUT I ALSO RECOGNISE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO HAVEN'T HAD AS GOOD CHANCES AS I'D LIKE THEM TO HAVE THAT HAVEN'T GOT THAT JOB OR THEIR THAT TRAINING AND WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO THEM AND EXPLAIN STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ACTUALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE TACKLED THESE PROBLEMS TOGETHER HE'S GETTING CREASED PEOPLE'S LIFE CHANCES IF I HAD TO SUM UP THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN OR A WORD IT WOULD BE THAT WORK TOGETHER I THINK TOGETHER WERE BETTER ABLE
SALINGER'S FROM TERRORISM AND CLIMATE CHANGE WERE BETTER ABLE TO GROW OUR ECONOMIES WERE BETTER ABLE TO DRIVE GOOD TRADE DEALS WITH CHINA AND AMERICA TOGETHER EUROPE IS ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN THE CHINESE ECONOMY BIGGER THAN THE PROBLEM ME AND I WANT US TO GET THE GOOD DEALS SO WE GIVE BETTER CHANCES TO EVERYONE AND I CAN AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT WORD TOGETHER IS THAT SOME PEOPLE TAKE THE VIEW THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS EFFECTIVELY SHUTTLING OURSELVES TO A CORPSE IF WE DO VOTE TO REMAIN IN EUROPE BECAUSE WE
WE WILL STAY IN AN ORGANISATION THAT IS HEADING IN EXACTLY THE WRONG DIRECTION FROM THE DIRECTION IN WHICH WE WANT TO BE GOING IN ALL SORTS A BIT I THINK THAT IS THE PROBLEM ISN'T IT IT'S A RATHER I'M SLIGHTLY PUZZLED US AS TWO BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR VISION OF BRITAIN IN EUROPE IS YOU'VE EXPLAINED ALL THE CAN'T WE BENEFITS THAT YOU THINK WILL FLOW FROM IT BUT ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE UP A UNITED EUROPE WOULD BE GOING A TROLLEY IN EUROPE WOULD BE GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM DIRECTION THAT WE WANT TO GO IN
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR I MEAN I DISAGREE WITH EVERY PART OF YOUR QUESTION AS IT WERE FIRST OF ALL WE ARE NOT SHACKLED TO A CORPSE YOU CAN SEE THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIES RECOVERING IT'S THE LARGEST MARKET IN THE WORLD HANG ON HANG ON THERE'S NO THE IDEA YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BEING A SUCCESS IN THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND CAMPAIGNING TO HAVE JOBS AND WEALTH CREATED BUT BY TRADING WITH OTHER ECONOMIES
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE YOU SHOULD DO BOTH THAT'S THE FIRST ONE SECOND POINT THEIR VISION OF BRITAIN IN EUROPE IS THAT WE DO HAVE A SPECIAL STATUS WE HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS WORK IN THAT SINGLE MARKET WERE DRIVING THAT SINGLE MARKET THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT BRITAIN CAN HELP EUROPE TO ACHIEVE WHETHER IT'S TACKLING TERRORISM OR SIGNING BETTER TRADE DEALS
IN THE FUTURE BUT WE HAVE OUR OWN SPECIAL STATUS PROTECTED I'M A DEEPLY PATRIOTIC PERSON ABOUT THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE NOT BEEN INVADED FOR A THOUSAND YEARS WE'VE GOT INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE SERVED AS WELL I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THAT UP TO SOME SORT OF UNITED EUROPE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WELL OUT OF THE EURO OUT OF EVER CLOSER UNION WE ARE PROUD BRITS AND UM YOU KNOW REALLY PROUD WHAT A COUNTRY CAN ACHIEVE BUT FRANKLY WE ACHIEVE MORE IF WET IN THESE ORGANISATIONS
FIGHTING FOR BRITISH INTERESTS AND BRITISH VALUES RATHER THAN STANDING OUTSIDE FOR THEM AND THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WE'D HAVE OUR EAR PRESSED TO THE GLASS WHILE GERMANY ITALY AND FRANCE MADE DECISIONS ABOUT A CONTINENT OUR RULES OUR FUTURES BUT WE WOULDN'T BE THERE LET'S NOT LET THEM MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT US WITHOUT US WE SHOULD BE FIGHTING DOESN'T QUIT AND WILL YOU BE IN THERE WIN OR LOSE YOU'LL STILL BE PIERRE

MORE THAN A THOUSAND BUSINESS LEADERS INCLUDING DIRECTORS FROM FIFTY ONE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES HAVE SIGNED AN OPEN LETTER TO THE TIMES BACKING THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. A BUSINESS LEADER IN GERMANY HAS SAID IT WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH FOR THE E.U. TO IMPOSE TRADE BARRIERS ON THE U.K. IF IT VOTED TO LEAVE
SIR CLIFF RICHARD HAS SAID HE'S CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AND THE B. B. C. WHICH FILM A RAID ON HIS BERKSHIRE MANSION AT THE START OF A POLICE INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD SEX ABUSE LAST WEEK THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE DROPPED ITS CASE CITING INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
A BRITISH WOMAN WHO WAS CONVICTED IN PERU OF SMUGGLING COCAINE IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE FLYING BACK TO THE U.K. AFTER SHE WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON MELISSA REID WAS ARRESTED AT LIMA AIRPORT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH AN IRISH WOMAN BECAME MCCOLLUM
IT IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE WE'RE HEARING MORE BAD NEWS THIS MORNING ABOUT DIESEL CARS RESEARCH SEEN BY THE B. B. C. SUGGESTS THAT POLLUTION FROM ANY POPULAR DIESEL CARS IS MUCH WORSE WHEN IT'S COLDER THAN EIGHTEEN DEGREES OUTSIDE MILLIONS OF VEHICLES COULD POTENTIALLY BE DRIVING AROUND FOR MOST OF THE YEAR WITH THEIR POLLUTION CONTROLS PARTLY TURNED OFF THE TESTING COMPANY EMISSIONS ANALYTIC SAYS IT'S MEASURED A SIGNIFICANT RISE AND POISONOUS GAS EMISSIONS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF MODELS AS THE TEMPERATURE DROPS
THE BODY THAT REPRESENTS THE CAR INDUSTRY SAYS IT'S ALL WITHIN THE RULES AND IT'S TO STOP DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE AS A TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT RICHARD WESTCOTT WHAT
IN THE U.S. VOLKSWAGENS IN CRISIS FACING MASSIVE FINES AFTER CHEATING IN VEHICLE EMISSIONS THE V.W. SCANDAL WAS QUITE SIMPLE THEY BROKE THE RULES TO FALL AMERICAN EMISSIONS TEST
NINE MONTHS AND MANY SPOT CHECKS LATER NO ONE ELSE HAS BEEN FOUND CHEATING BUT NEW RESEARCH ARE SEEN BY THE B.B.C. SUGGEST CAR COMPANIES ARE DOING SOMETHING ELSE THAT INCREASES POLLUTION SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE WEATHER WHAT'S MORE IT'S INTENTIONAL AND IT'S LEGAL
THIS IS HOW YOU TEST HOW DIRTY ARE KARI'S EFFECTIVELY WERE DRIVING ROUND IN A NORMAL CAR BUT THERE'S A SYSTEM FITTED ON THE BACK IT'S A SERIES OF PIPES AND BOXES THAT MEASURING ALL THE POISONOUS GASES
COMING OUT OF THE EXHAUST PIPE AND I'M WITH NICK MULDER'S THE BOSUN ADMISSIONS ANALYTICS AND YOUR COMPANY DOES THIS TESTING PROFESSIONALLY YOU'VE TESTED MORE CARS ON THE ROAD THAN ANYONE ELSE AND WHAT HAVE YOU ACTUALLY FOUND WHEN YOU'VE TESTED CARS AND IT'S A BIT CHILLIER OUTSIDE PARTICULARLY FOR THE EURO FIVE CARS THE PREVIOUS GENERATION THERE WAS A MUCH HIGHER AVERAGE LEVEL OF EMISSIONS BELOW
ABOUT EIGHTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS ABOVE AND THAT IS A SIGN THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE OFF TO TREATMENT ALL THE ENGINE SET UP THAT IS ALLOWING THE VEHICLE TO EMIT MORE WHEN COLDER AND THE SUSPICION IS THAT THAT IS TO GIVE THE CAR BETTER FUEL ECONOMY
EMISSIONS ANALYTICS TESTED TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN MODELS ACROSS THIRTY ONE MANUFACTURER'S THESE EURO FIVE CATEGORY CARS THAT WENT ON SALE FIVE YEARS AGO AND WILL BE AVAILABLE UNTIL THE END OF AUGUST THERE ARE MORE THAN FIVE MILLION OF THEM ON BRITAIN'S ROADS
ON AVERAGE THEY WERE THREE POINT SIX TIMES OVER THE EUROPEAN LIMIT FOR POISONOUS KNOCKS GASES WHEN IT WAS ABOVE EIGHTEEN DEGREES OUTSIDE BUT THAT INCREASED TO FOUR POINT SIX TIMES OVER THE LIMIT WHEN TEMPERATURES FELL BELOW EIGHTEEN DEGREES AND BEAR IN MIND IT AVERAGED BELOW EIGHTEEN DEGREES FOR MOST OF THE YEAR LAST YEAR THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DAYS
CAR MAKERS ARE ALLOWED TO DO THIS THEY CAN PROGRAMME THE ENGINE TO INCREASE POLLUTION AS LONG AS IT'S TO STOP IT BREAKING
AND ENGINEERS TELL ME THAT COLD OR HOT WEATHER CAN INDEED DAMAGE COMPONENTS BUT THE SUSPICION IS THAT SOME COMPANIES MIGHT BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE RULES TO SWITCH OFF POLLUTION CONTROLS WHEN THEY DON'T REALLY NEED TO BECAUSE IT IMPROVES THE MILES PER GALLON OF THEIR CAR
MY COURSE CHIEF EXECUTIVE SOCIETY MOTOR MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS THIS IS TEMPERATURES AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DEGREES A LOT WARMER THAN IT IS MOST OF THE TIME IN THE U.K. IS THAT REALLY ABOUT PROTECTING THE ENGINE ON ASLEEP DO YOU NEED TO SWITCH OFF ALL YOUR ADMISSIONS SYSTEMS AT SEVENTEEN DEGREES THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SWITCH OFF INVARIABLY THERE'S A SLIDING SCALE SO AS YOU GET DOWN INTO COLDER TEMPERATURES AND EQUALLY VERY VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ENGINE IS PROTECTED OTHERWISE THERE'LL BE DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE
THAT WILL CLEARLY AFFECTS BOTH OF EACH PERFORMANCE AND INDEED THE RELIABILITY ENGINE WHICH ULTIMATELY CAN COST A CONSUMER SO IT IS ABOUT PROTECTING THE ENGINE ENSURING THE VEHICLE CONTINUE TO START IN EXTREME
THE EMISSIONS ANALYTICS DATA IS BACKED UP BY RECENT TESTING BY THE FRENCH GERMAN AND BRITISH GOVERNMENTS WHICH ALSO FOUND CARS WERE MORE POLICING WHEN IT WAS COLDER OUTSIDE MAKE AND SAYS THE INDUSTRY HAS QUESTIONS TO ANSWER THE SCANDAL WITH VOLKSWAGENS AND RIP THE LID OFF THIS WHOLE AREA AND NOW PEOPLE HAVE STARTED INVESTIGATING IN MORE DETAIL LOTS OF PEOPLE TESTING US AND OTHERS
AND NOW BEGINNING TO UNEARTH ALL SORTS OF OTHER ISSUES AND OTHER LOOPHOLES IN THE REGULATIONS THAT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED SO I THINK THERE'LL BE MORE TO COME
I WAS RICHARD WESTCOTT LET'S TALK TO GREG ARCHER IS CLEAN VEHICLES DIRECTOR AT THE LOBBY GROUP TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT MY CAUSE A THEY'RE FROM THE MOTOR INDUSTRY BODY THAT AND IT IT IS SOMETHING DONE TO PROTECT ENGINES AND IT'S WITHIN THE RULES
MANUFACTURERS ARE TURNING DOWN THE SAUCE WHICH IT SYSTEMS AND TURNING THEM OFF AT BELOW SEVENTEEN DEGREES ABOVE THIRTY DEGREES WHEN THE CAR'S HEAVILY LOADED AND AT HIGH SPEEDS AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO
NOW I THINK THE LAW SAYS VERY CLEARLY THAT MANUFACTURERS MUST EQUIP THE CAR SO THAT IN NORMAL USE IT COMPLIES WITH THE EMISSIONS REGULATIONS THIS EXCEPTION TO PROTECT THE ENGINE IS DESIGNED TO BE USED IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT'S ENOUGH I THINK MONTHS A YEAR YEAH SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT ACTUALLY THEY ARE
ACTING OUTSIDE AT LEAST THE SPIRIT OF THE ROOKS I BELIEVE THEY WERE ACTING OUTSIDE THE LETTER OF THE RULES IF THOSE RULES WERE BEING PROPERLY ENFORCED I KNOW THAT H.M.S. IT'S THE AUTHORITIES AS THE GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE UP FOR IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S WHICH WERE AT FAULT AND WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THIRTY OF THE MOST POLLUTING DIESEL CARS IN EUROPE AND NINE OF THOSE WERE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT FOR TRANSPORT'S AGENCY THE VEHICLE CERTIFICATION AGENCY IN THE U.K.
AND YET DESPITE THAT NO CAR HAS BEEN RECALLED EITHER ON A VOLUNTARY OR A MANDATORY BASIS YET FROM THE U.K. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE GERMANS AND THE FRENCH I DON'T THINK THIS AND JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR YOU THINK THAT THESE CARS ARE BEING APPROVED THE COEURS THE RELEVANT AGENCY SET MORE STORE BY THE MOTOR MANUFACTURERS DOING WELL THAN BY PEOPLE'S HEALTH
THE AGENCIES ARE NOT PROPERLY DOING THEIR JOBS THEY ARE RELYING ON WHAT THE MANUFACTURERS ARE TELLING THEM THEY ARE NOT SCRUTINISING WHAT IS BEING DONE BY ARE NOT PROPERLY TESTING THE VEHICLES MOST OF THE TESTS ARE PERFORMED IN THE LABORATORIES OF THE MANUFACTURERS THEMSELVES THEY NEED TO BE DOING A MUCH MORE RIGOUROUS
AND THEY NEED TO BE RECALLING THE CARS THAT ON OG DRIVING AROUND BRITAIN'S ROADS FIVE MILLION OFF THEM POLLUTING AND CAUSING HE'LL HELP AND YOU THINK THEY COULD BE RECALLED AND ALTERED WITHOUT THEIR ENGINES BEING DANCE HAD SUFFICIENT SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE
YES I THINK THEY CAN BE RECALLED IN THE U.S. VEHICLES DON'T SWITCH OFF THE AFTER TREATMENT SYSTEMS AT BELOW SEVENTEEN DEGREES C. THEY START TO TURN THEM DOWN AT AROUND FIVE DEGREES C. OR LOWER FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTED ENTIRELY WHAT DO YOU TRUST THAT TO GET YOUR VIEW OF THIS PART OF TRANSPORT HAVE TOLD US WE WANT TO SEE ACTION TO ENSURE THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE OVER USING THESE SYSTEMS IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU

ENJOY IT THANKS FOR TALKING TO US PETER BEST SIXTY MINUTES TO NINE WAS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THINKER THOMAS MALTHUS WRITE ABOUT ANYTHING HE'S DOOMED FOR EVER READY TO BE ASSOCIATE IN OUR MINDS WITH A PRETTY DISMAL VIEW OF POPULATION GROWTH ASSURED US THAT THERE'D BE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD NOT ENOUGH FOOD FOR THEM WE WOULD LEAVE SHORT LIVES OF FAMINE AND MISERY BECOME AWAY A BIT OF A JOKE BUT A SCIENCE EDITOR TOM FEEL
HAS BEEN TALKING TO A DISTINGUISHED HISTORIAN HE THINKS WE SHOULD TAKE MOTHER'S MORE SERIOUSLY SHE'S AUTHOR OF THE NEW WORLDS OF THOMAS ROBERT MALTHUS ALISON BASHFORD
HERE WE HAVE ONE OF THE COPIES OF MY OFFICERS ESSAY ON THE COURSE POPULATION THIS IS THE EIGHTEEN OH THREE EDITION SMALL WE HELD FRAN OLD ANNEXE TO JESUS COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE'S SEVENTEENTH CENTURY OLD LIBRARY SUMMERSON BASH FOR THE WIR HARMSWORTH PROFESSOR OF IMPERIAL AND NAVAL HISTORY INTRODUCES ME
TO THE MALTHUS COLLECTION SO HAVE ALL OF MY OFFICERS BOOKS HERE AND MANY OF THEM HE RESEARCHED WHEN HE WAS WRITING AND RE WRITING HIS FAMOUS HIS SAY ON THE PRINCIPLE OF POPULATION
THE MOST FAMOUS BOOK ON POPULATION EVER WRITTEN AND EVER LIKELY TO BE WRITTEN
QUITE SOME BILLING BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE MOUTH AS HIS ESSAY IS FRONT AND CENTRE IN THE PANTHEON OF POLITICALLY UNACCEPTABLE READS AND INTELLECTUAL FIG LEAF FOR IMPERIALISM EXPLOITATION AND GENOCIDE
HIS GREAT INSPIRATIONS WAS BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND THAT BOX HERE AND THAT'S A SHANE ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR BASHFORD WHO ARGUES WITH HARVARD'S JOYCE CHAPLAIN IN THE NEW WORLDS OF THOMAS ROBERT MALTHUS THAT HE'S BEEN THE VICTIM OF HISTORICAL MISAPPROPRIATION
HIS REPUTATION BLACKENED BY A SUBSEQUENT ASSOCIATION WITH FASCISM A NEW TUNICS AND A HARD HEARTED DISDAIN FOR THE FATE OF THE POOR EVERYBODY RECOGNISES THE NAME OFFICE AND THEN SOME SENSE IN WHICH IT'S A
LIMITING POPULATION AND THAT'S WHERE THE GREAT CONTROVERSY OF COURSE WITH MALPAS LIVES
BUT THIS FOR ME AS A HISTORIAN JUST DIDN'T MATCH WHAT I READ THE POLITICAL ECONOMIST BY TRAINING MALTHUS WAS INTERESTED IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POPULATION GROWTH WHICH HE ARGUED INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES INCLUDING FOOD WHICH DEVELOP MORE SLOWLY
THE RESULTING MISMATCH LED TO DISASTER WENT CHECK BY NATURE IN THE FORM OF FAMINE AND DISEASE OR BY MAN THROUGH GORE OR INFANTICIDE POVERTY MALTHUS ARGUED
WAS INEVITABLE IT'S CLEAR THAT HE WAS NAMING SOMETHING AS IT HAPPENED TELLING US THE WAY THINGS ARE THAT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WOULD GROW OR DIMINISH
ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT OF FOOD AVAILABLE AND POPULATIONS ARE LIMITED BY VERY UNPLEASANT THINGS YOU KNOW PEOPLE DIE THROUGH INFANTICIDE THROUGH STARVATION THROUGH KILLING EACH OTHER THROUGH WAR END THROUGH DISEASE ALL THESE NONE OF HIS THINGS HE WANTED BUT HE WAS DESCRIBING THAT AS THE WAY HE SAW IT HAPPENING AS A PRINCIPLE AS A KIND OF A LAW
BUT WHAT IS THERE NOT OFTEN UNDERSTOOD IS THAT HE WAS DEEPLY ENGAGED WITH THE QUESTION OF HOW AND PIPE WE AMELIORATE THAT AND THAT'S WHY HE'S SO UNPOPULAR AND WAS POPULAR
THIS POINT I SHOULD PROBABLY ADMIT TO SOMETHING OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
FOR MANY YEARS MY OFFICE WAS A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY AT THE EAST INDIA COMPANY COLLEGE NOW THE SCHOOL
WAS A BOY HERE IT WAS A SCHOOL UNAPOLOGETICALLY STEEPED IN ITS IMPERIAL HISTORY WITH HOUSES NAMED AFTER ALUMNI LIKE GENERAL ALLENBY THE VICEROY OF INDIA LORD LAURENCE AND RUDYARD KIPLING
BUT THERE WAS NO MALTHUS HOUSE GRIM INDEED NEVER ANY MENTION OF HIS NAME
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW OF HIS CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL UNTIL I READ ALISON BASH FOR THIS BOOK
THERE ARE MANY TREASURES HERE MY EARNED TREASURE BUT I'M PULLING OUT NOW HIS MOUTH LASS'S OWN COPY OF JAMES COOK'S VOYAGE IT'S MUM FUSSES REMEDY TO REDUCE THE SURPLUS POPULATION WAS UNDOUBTEDLY IF IT'S TIME
BUT WHAT EMERGES FROM THE NEW WORLDS OF THOMAS ROBERT MALTHUS IT'S A MUCH MORE NUANCED PICTURE OF THE MAN CONCERNED ABOUT THE FATE OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND HIS ANALYSIS OF THE EBB AND FLOW BETWEEN POPULATION AND RESOURCES STILL HAS RESONANCE TODAY HE WOULD BE SHOCKED
BY EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED THROUGH THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BUT HE WOULD STILL SAY MY THESIS HOLDS BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL LIMITS AND WORKING WITH US TALKING
I THINK SHE WOULD SAY LOOK IT LOOK IN MY BOOK WHERE I SAID THE WHOLE WORLD IS LIKE AN ISLAND
YOU THINK MALTHUS WOULD BE A CHAMPION FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT FOR SUSTAINABILITY IF HE WAS ALIVE TODAY HE WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN THE PROBLEM THAT'S FOR SURE
I WAS TOM FIELD AND REPORTING IN FACT HE WAS DOING MORE THAN REPORTING HE WAS TALKING TO ALISON BASHFORD HIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO READ IT WAS CALLED THE NEW WORLD OF THOMAS ROBERT MALTHUS
WE COULD DO WITH A BIT OF NO REAL INCIDENT WITH POSSIBLY THE WOODEN END OF THE CAMPAIGN OR MAYBE BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN BEGAN HE CERTAINLY RAISED HIS HEAD'S AT VARIOUS STAGES OF IT WHICH BRINGS US RATHER NICELY TO TEN TO NINE AND TWO WELL A DAY TO GO AND ALL THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PRIME MINISTER WE'VE HEARD FROM VARIOUS PEOPLE DOING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME LET US FINISH
A B.B.C. EXPERTS AS IT WERE AND WHEN I SAY THE WORD EXPERTS OF COURSE AROUND ME DIDN'T I REALISED I'VE GOT A JAR GOING ON THERE O.K. DO IT I'LL HAVE IT ECONOMICS EDITOR CATCH WHADDAYA EDITOR NORMAN SMITH I THINK IS ON THE LINE OUR SAYS I AM INDEED TRYING TO GET IT FOR YOU FIRST OF ALL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT THE P.M. OUT THERE SAYING TO JOHN
I THOUGHT HE WAS INTERESTING ON IMMIGRATION AGAIN PRETTY MUCH DEFENDING HIS AMBITION THAT'S NOT A TARGET ANY MORE IT'S AN AMBITION OF GETTING NET MIGRATION DOWN TO THE TENS OF THOUSAND SAYING IT WAS QUOTES NOT AN UNREALISTIC AMBITION I MEAN
I QUESTION THAT BECAUSE BY THEIR TREASURIES OWN ANALYSIS WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO KEEP ON MISSING IT RIGHT UP TO TWENTY THIRTY BY A HUGE AMOUNT AND YET MY CAMERA STILL SAYING IT'S NOT AN UNREALISTIC AMBITION AND SUGGESTING THAT THE ONLY REASON HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO MEET IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN LIVING IN VERY VERY STRANGE TIMES WHERE THE BRITISH ECONOMY HAS BEEN GROWING AND THE REST OF EUROPE HAS BEEN DOWN IN THE DOLDRUMS AND THAT IS WHY HE'S BEEN UNABLE TO MEET IT SO I WAS
I WAS SLIGHTLY SURPRISED THAT HE SOUGHT TO ALIGN HIMSELF STILL SO CLOSELY WITH THAT PLEDGE WHICH HAS PROVED SO CONTENTIOUS AND SO DAMAGING AND HE ALSO SAID THAT
WE WERE ABLE NOW TO REOPEN THE QUESTION A FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WITHIN THE SINGLE MARKET IF IF WE IF WE STAY HOW I WAS I WAS VERY STRUCK BY THAT AS AS NORMAN SAYS THAT HE WANTS TO LOOK AGAIN AT THIS FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT ISSUE
TAKING AWAY THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT CLEARLY HASN'T BEEN ON THE TABLE FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THE ISSUE ABOUT THE FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THE POLITICAL DEBATE IN THE U.K. I DON'T THINK WILL BE OFF THE TABLE HE SAID REFORM CONTINUES ON FRIDAY AND IT'S QUITE INTERESTING SPEAKING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO GEORGE OSBORNE
FOR EXAMPLE THEY DO KNOW THAT THIS IMMIGRATION PROBLEM THE PROBLEM OF CONTROL HAS BEEN ONE OF THE CENTRAL ISSUES OF THE REFERENDUM REFERENDUM DEBATE I THINK DAVID CAN WAS MAKING QUITE A SUBTLE POINT ACTUALLY HE SAID THAT FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TILL NOW THERE'S BEEN A PROBLEM FOR BRITAIN BECAUSE OUR GROWTH HAS BEEN HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE EURO AREA SO WE HAVE BEEN A MAGNET FOR PEOPLE COMING HERE TO FIND WORK
HE SEEMED TO BE SUGGESTING THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE FOR THIS IN THE DATA THAT THE EURO AREA WAS NOWT IMPROVING ECONOMICALLY AND THEREFORE THOSE FLOWS MIGHT CHANGE INTO BACK INTO THE OTHER DIRECTION MORE BALANCED AS HE PUT IT ECONOMICALLY AS I SAY THERE IS SOME BASIS FOR THAT ARGUMENT IS NOT ABOUT DIRECT CONTROLS ON NUMBERS BUT IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH COMING BACK TO THE EURO AREA WHICH MIGHT TO AN EXTENT SOLVE THIS ISSUE
THAT LOOKS COS CAPTURED HARD TO IMAGINE TURNING UP FOR THEIR FIRST DINNER ALL THE LEADERS HAVE THEIR FIRST DINNER AFTER HE'S WON THE REFERENDUM BY TWO PER CENT OR SOMETHING AND SAYING ALL RIGHT GUYS WE'RE STILL IN I KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT US TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IMMIGRATION BEFORE THE BUT THE BOAT PRE MOVEMENT PEOPLE BUT NOW LET'S START THAT DEBATE ALL OVER AGAIN WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO SAY TO HIM
I THINK IT'S NOT JUST BUT EVEN BEFORE IT WOULD GET TO DINNER I THINK IT WOULD BE GRABBING THE TELEPHONES AND IT'S NO LONGER JUST ABOUT THE U.K. I THINK AS WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS REFERENDUM DEBATE THERE IS THIS AGAIN A TENDENCY FOR THE U.K. TO THINK WE'RE AN ISLAND TO MESS WITH A EUROSCEPTIC IRELAND WE NEED AN E. THAT FITS US BUT ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE HEARING SHOUTS FROM THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE THE VOTERS OF EUROPE SAYING NO WE NEED AN INNIE THAT FIT ALL OF US AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING EUROPEAN POLITICS
A LONG TIME SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX I HAVE NEVER FELT THE MOOD MORE EURO SCEPTIC THEN THIS MIXTURE OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS AT THE EURO CRISIS FEELING CHEATED BY THE POWERS ALSO THESE TERROR AND SECURITY FEARS PEOPLE WANT TO CHANGE THERE WAS LESS OF AN APPETITE ACTUALLY TO LEAVE THE E.U. BUT LOOK AT EVEN IF WE LEAVE
THE FEAR IS IT WILL SPREAD TO THAT THIS HAS A DOUBLE EFFECT LOOK AT THE MAIN POWERS OF EUROPE APART FROM THE U.K. IT IS SEEN AS PART OF THE BIG THREE FOR THE OTHER ONES WOULD BE GERMANY GENERALLY SEEN AS SUCH A EUROPEAN STATE AND YET THEY'RE THE IDEA OF EVER CLOSER UNION THESE DAYS FOR THE GERMANS MEANS BEING EVER MORE LIABLE TO
PAY THE BILLS OF WEAKER ECONOMIES AND THE PEOPLE OF GERMANY DON'T WANT THAT IN FRANCE POLL SHOW YOU HER SCEPTICISM IS MASSIVELY HIGH MARINE LE PEN OF THE NATIONAL FRONT SHE'S EXPECTED TO GET INTO THE SECOND ROUND OF THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE NEXT YEAR GERMANY AND FRANCE HAD BIG ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR THE LEADERS HAVE EUROSCEPTIC MORE NATIONALIST MINDED PARTIES BREATHING DOWN THEIR NECKS THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEIR PEOPLE THE PEN SAYS IF SHE'S PRESIDENT IN SIX MONTHS SHE'LL HOLD A REFERENDUM IF SHE CAN'T CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE
SHE WILL CAMPAIGN FOR I'M SORRY I HAVE TO SAY IT A FOR EXIT SO THE MOOD IS CHANGING AND THE PENNY HAS FINALLY DROPPED IN BRUSSELS THAT FOR ME IS THE MOST AMAZING THING WHEN YOU HAVE JEAN CLAUDE YOUNGER THE FEDERALIST MINDED PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ADMITTING JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO YES WE DO MEDAL TOO MUCH AND PEOPLE'S LIVES AND DONAL TELL US WHO'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL HE REPRESENTS ALL E.U. LEADERS IN BRUSSELS AND HE SAYS
REX IT OR NOT WHETHER THE U.K. STAYS OR LEAVES WE HAVE TO TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT OURSELVES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE DON'T TRUST US ANY MUM I THINK DONNA WAS JUST QUICKLY THERE WAS ONE INTERESTING POINT TO YORK TO YOUR POINT ABOUT YOU ESCAPIST EXCEPT SCHISM IN EURGH IN THE REST OF EUROPE IF BRITAIN LEEDS WAS A POLE IN SWEDEN WHICH PUT ANTI EUROPEAN UNION SENTIMENT AT THIRTY NINE PER CENT
WITH BRITAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ASKED THE SAME QUESTION WITH BRITAIN OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT FIGURE ROSE TO FIFTY NINE PER CENT IF YOU THINK OF THE NATIONS THAT AREN'T IN THE EUROZONE BRITAIN IS THEIR BIGGEST ALLY AT THE TOP TABLE BECAUSE WE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN EUROPE AND IF WE WERE TO LEAVE COUNTRIES LIKE SWEDEN LIKE DENMARK I THINK WOULD FEEL THAT THE THE POWER
WADE'S FOCUS WITHIN EUROPE WOULD MOVE MUCH MORE DECISIVELY TOWARDS THE EUROZONE BECAUSE THEY'VE LOST THEIR BIGGEST ALLY AND I THINK THAT WOULD CREATE SOME POLITICAL AND NORMAN FROM A BRITISH DOMESTIC POINT OF VIEW THEN AND WE WOULDN'T WANT TO LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS MAKE OF THESE SUGGESTIONS THAT EUROPE WOULD BE NOT JUST AFFECTED BUT POTENTIALLY GENUINELY UTTERLY DESTABILISED
BY WHAT WE DID HERE WAS ACTUALLY THERE IT'S ONLY WHAT THEY'VE SAID TO US AND ANSWERS ON THIS PROGRAMME IS IT WILL BE GOOD FOR YOU IT WOULD BE WOULD BENEFIT THEY'D GET UP AND SHOCK AND IT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO REFORM ET-CETERA SENT ONE OF THEY HAVE DESCRIBED IT I THINK I'VE HEARD MICHAEL GO DESCRIBING IT AS THE LIBERATION OF URINE WHICH SOME MIGHT REGARD THAT AS A SLIGHTLY TASTELESS
WAY OF CHARACTERISING A BUT THEY DO THEY SEE THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY WERE SAYING AT LAST NIGHT IN THE DEBATE AS A SORT OF AN OUTDATED BROKEN POLITICAL CONSTRUCT WHICH MAY HAVE STARTED WITH
AND NOBLE IDEALS BUT IS NOW SORT OF IRRECOVERABLE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE EUROZONE BUT I THINK THE WHOLE POLITICAL DIRECTION OF TRAVEL IS OUT OF DATE AND THEY ENVISAGE A VERY DIFFERENT FUTURE WITH BRITAIN AS IT WERE PIONEERING THE WAY AND LEADING WHERE OTHERS WILL FOLLOW AND THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN PART OF THE PICTURE ME THEY HAVEN'T PUT IT UP SQUARE
FRONT AND CENTRE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE MUCH TRACTION WITH THE BRITISH ELECTORATE I DON'T SUPPOSE PEOPLE HAD TERRIFICALLY BOTHERED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT EVENTUALLY EMERGES FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION OR IF WE DO VOTE FOR BRECHT'S THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE CALL BREAD AND BUTTER IMMIGRATION AND JOB SO THAT SENSE OF WITH EUROPE
THAT HASN'T REALLY BEEN CENTRAL TO THEIR CAMPAIGN BUT ALBEIT THEY DO FOR YOU IT IS A MOMENT WHEN EUROPE CAN BE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED AND ALTERED FROM THE CURRENT EUROPEAN BUT OF COURSE THAT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE CATCHER COULD GO IN THE DIRECTION OF OF A SUPERSTAR
AS I SAY THE APPETITE IS HAS NEVER BEEN IT LESS THERE REALLY I MEAN YOU LOST LAST YEAR MUCH AS MAYBE NOT I'VE GOT THE RUN THE OPERATION I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT I WOULD HAVE THEN A GREATER TENSION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THOSE AT THE TOP HE SAID THE TIME HAS COME TO DOUBLE DOWN WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING BEFORE AS THEY SAY YOU'RE BOTCHING FOR MANY MANY YEARS I REMEMBER BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND I WAS LIVING IN AUSTRIA AUSTRIA HAD THIS ROTATING PRESIDENCY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND THE LEADERS THEN SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO USE THIS PRESIDENCY OF THE E.U. TO BRING YOU CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE AND THE GAME IN THE GAME WE'VE HEARD IT AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY FAILED AS I SAID EVEN IN THE CORRIDORS OF BRUSSELS THE PENNY HAS DROPPED LOUDLY NOW THEY CANNOT MOVE TOWARDS A SUPERSTATE EVEN EVEN JUST A MONTH AGO THE SUPPOSITION WAS IT BRITAIN LEAVES THE E.U. THE REST OF YOU HAS THE POOL CLOSER TOGETHER TO THIS IDEA WILL WORK FASTER ON ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION YOU KNOW JUST TO SHOW THAT WE'RE ALL TOGETHER
AND SECRETLY I'M HEARING SOURCES IN FRANCE AND GERMANY SAYING THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG MESSAGE TO SEND OUR PEOPLE PARTICULARLY AHEAD OF ELECTIONS BIG ELECTIONS IN OUR COUNTRY BUT CAN I JUST MAKE A POINT ON WITH THE EUROPE AND WHETHER IT'S RELEVANT TO THE U.K. A LOT OF THE U.K. VOTES TO LEAVE IT IS RELEVANT BECAUSE
IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER THE U.K. WILL WANT TO HAVE A TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. AT THE MOMENT THE Y. YOU KNOW IF HE COULD SIT IT WOULD BE ON THE EDGE OF ITS SEAT TONIGHT IT'S REALLY HOPING THE U.K. WILL STAY IN IF IT LEAVES THE MEAD IS GETTING INCREASINGLY TO FIND IT COULD GET VERY MESSY INDEED AND A QUICK ONE COMMAND I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT ON MONDAY MORNING WE WILL SEE THE
BIG BIG BOSSES OF THE BIG BIG FIRMS CALLING IN THE REMOVAL LORRIES TO TRUNDLE OFF SOMEWHERE ON THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT NO WE WON'T JOHN BECAUSE OF COURSE NOTHING WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE ON THE GROUND FOR QUITE A LONG TIME I THINK THIS IS THE THE ISSUE OF THE POSSIBLE THREAT TO THE ECONOMY IS A LONGER TERM ISSUE BECAUSE IF THERE WERE TRADE BARRIERS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND AND THE REST OF EUROPE THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM BUT IT'S A LONG TERM PROBLEM THE REMOVAL LORRIES WON'T BE ARRIVING ON MONDAY
