IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE NINTH OF JULY GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CANDIDATE ANDREA LEAD SOME TOLD THE TIMES THAT BECAUSE SHE HAS CHILDREN SHE HAS A GREATER INTEREST IN THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY THAN HER RIVAL THERESA MAY MISSUS LED SOME SAYS HER COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MISREPRESENTED HERE'S THE RECORDING OF HER CONVERSATION WITH THE TIMES REPORT
BEING A MOTHER MEANS VERY REAL THING YOU CAN HAVE A COUNTRY A TANGERINE
POLICE IN DALLAS SAY THEY FOUND A BOMB MAKING MATERIALS AT THE HOME OF A GUNMAN WHO KILLED FIVE POLICE OFFICERS ALSO IN THE PROGRAMME HOW WILL HISTORY BE REWRITTEN AFTER THE CHILCOTT REPORT AND WHAT NOW FOR THE FUTURE OF IRAQ AND IT'S A BIG WEEKEND FOR BRITISH SPORT ANDY MURRAY WILL ATTEMPT TO WIN WIMBLEDON FOR A SECOND TIME WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM
TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS ZEB ZONES
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CANDIDATE ANDREA LEAD SUMMER'S BEEN ACCUSED OF MAKING THE CONTEST PERSONAL BY SUGGESTING THAT HAVING CHILDREN MAKES A BETTER CHOICE TO BE PRIME MINISTER THE ALLEGATION IS MADE BY THE TIMES NEWSPAPER WHICH QUOTES THE ENERGY MINISTER SAYING THE FACT THAT SHE IS A MOTHER MEANS SHE HAS A VERY REAL STAKE IN BRITAIN'S FUTURE MISSUS LIPTON'S RIVAL THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY HAS NO CHILDREN THIS HAS LED SOME HAS CRITICISED THE ARTICLE IN THE TIMES SAYING IT MISS REPRESENTS HER COMMENTS HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN
THE TIMES ARTICLE WAS BASED ON AN INTERVIEW WITH MISSUS LETS AND HE WAS A MOTHER OF THREE IT QUOTES HER IS SAYING THAT THERESA MAY WILL BE REALLY SAD SHE DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN AND SO IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE FOR A POINT TO BE MADE OF THE ISSUE
BUT MISSUS LED SOME REPORTEDLY WENT ON TO SAY THAT BEING A MOTHER MEANT HAVING A VERY REAL STAKE IN THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY AND REFERRING TO MISSUS MAY SHE IS QUOTED AS SAYING SHE POSSIBLY HAS NIECES NEPHEWS LOTS OF PEOPLE BUT I HAVE CHILDREN WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN WHO WILL DIRECTLY BE A PART OF WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
THERESA MAY'S CAMPAIGN TEAM MADE NO OFFICIAL COMMENT BUT A SOURCE SAID THEY PERSONALLY FOUND THE ARTICLE SAD AND OFFENSIVE FOLLOWING ITS PUBLICATION MISSUS LED SOME SAID THE STORY WAS APPALLING AND THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID
POLICE IN DALLAS SAY THEY FOUND BOMB MAKING MATERIAL AND THE CACHE OF WEAPONS AT THE HOME OF THE MAN WHO SHOT DEAD FIVE POLICE IN THE CITY MICHAEL JOHNSON AN ARMY VETERAN OPEN FIRE DURING A STREET PROTEST AGAINST THE KILLING OF BLACK THEN BY WHITE POLICE OFFICERS SEVEN PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK POLICE EVENTUALLY KILL JOHNSON USING A BOMB CARRIED IN A REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE A CORRESPONDENT JAMES COOKE REPORTS FROM DALLAS
MICHAEL JOHNSON WAS JUST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND HAD SERVED HIS COUNTRY IN AFGHANISTAN AS A PRIVATE IN THE U.S. ARMY
ON THURSDAY NIGHT JOHNSON HE WAS BLACK TURNED ON HIS FELLOW AMERICANS USING A RIFLE TO AMBUSH AND MARTA WHITE POLICE OFFICER
POLICE SAY HE TOLD NEGOTIATORS HE WAS RETALIATING FOR THE KILLINGS OF TWO BLACK MEN SHOT BY POLICE IN LOUISIANA AND MINNESOTA EARLIER THIS WEEK
INVESTIGATORS HAD REVEALED THAT JOHNSON HAD AMASSED AN ARSENAL AT A SUBURBAN HOME IN TEXAS INCLUDING BOMB MAKING MATERIALS BULLETPROOF VESTS RIFLES AND AMMUNITION
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TO CUT SHORT HIS TRIP TO EUROPE TO VISIT DALLAS EARLY NEXT WEEK AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE APPEALED FOR CALM AS PROTESTS BOTH FOR AND AGAINST THE POLICE CONTINUE IN A NATION ON THE EDGE
IT'S EMERGED THAT AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF LABOUR'S DEFENCE POLICY WILL KEEP OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF BRITAIN RETAINING A NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM THE B.B.C.'S NEWSNIGHT PROGRAMME UNDERSTANDS THE JEREMY CORBIN HAS ACCEPTED THE DRAFT CONCLUSIONS DESPITE HAVING CAMPAIGN FOR DISARMAMENT THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER
UNDER THE PROPOSALS ANY SYSTEM WOULD HAVE TO MEET FIVE TESTS INCLUDING AN ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER THEIR WEAPONS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEFENCE OF THE U.K. AND WOULD BE VALUE FOR MONEY THE GREEN PARTY M.P. CAROLINE LUCAS SEES IT AS AN UNSATISFACTORY COMPROMISE
DO YOU THINK THIS DOES SOUND VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT HE'S NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING THE LABOUR PARTY WITH HIM IN PARLIAMENT IN A MORE FORCEFUL WAY THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THESE TESTS THAT MIGHT BE ASKED OF THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT SEEMS TO ME TO BE
QUESTIONS THAT THE DEFENCE REVIEW SHOULD ITSELF HAVE ANSWERED NOT ONE FOR THE COMING OUT OF THE DEFENCE REVIEW AND SO TO THAT EXTENT I THINK THAT IT DOES LOOK LIKE A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FUDGE JEREMY CORBIN IS DUE TO ADDRESS ONE OF EUROPE'S LARGEST TRADES UNION GATHERINGS THEY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SECOND DURHAM MINERS' GALA TODAY A NUMBER OF LABOUR M.P.S WHO VOTED AGAINST MISTER CORBETT IN THE RECENT CONFIDENCE VOTE HAVE HAD THEIR PLATFORM PULSES RESCINDED ALTHOUGH THEY'VE NOT BEEN BANNED FROM THE EVENT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND
DAVID CAMERON WILL ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT HE SENDING UP TO FIFTY ADDITIONAL MILITARY PERSONNEL TO AFGHANISTAN THEY WILL HELP TRAIN HER ADVISE AFGHAN FORCES AS THEY BATTLE A RESURGENT TALIBAN MY CAMERON WILL JOIN OTHER LEADERS AT THE NATO SUMMIT IN WALSALL TODAY TO STRESS THE ALLIANCE'S CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO AFGHANISTAN SECURITY REPORTING FROM WARSAW A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN MARCUS
THE REINFORCEMENTS WILL JOIN SOME FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY BRITISH PERSONNEL ALREADY DEPLOYED IN AND AROUND THE AFGHAN CAPITAL COUPLE FORCE LEVELS FOR NATO'S OPERATION RESIDENTS' SUPPORT BUT TRAINS AND ASSIST THE AFGHAN MILITARY AND SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN UNDER URGENT REVIEW PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT THE U.S. WOULD BE KEEPING MORE TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN THAN HAD BEEN EXPECTED DUE TO THE WORSENING SECURITY CLIMATE
IT WAS KNOWN THAT OTHER NATO MEMBERS WERE REVIEWING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO A BRITISH OFFICIAL SPEAKING AHEAD OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS SAID THAT EXPANDED FIVE HUNDRED STRONG BRITISH FORCE WOULD STAY IN AFGHANISTAN INTO TWENTY SEVENTEEN HE SAID THAT BRITAIN WOULD ALSO CONTINUE TO GIVE SOME SEVENTY MILLION POUNDS A YEAR TO HELP THE AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION POUNDS WOULD GO TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT NEXT YEAR
THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH SAYS THAT CUSTOMERS HAD SEVERAL HIGH STREET BANKS WHO BREACHED THEIR OVERDRAFT LIMITS CAN FACE CHARGES WHICH ARE AROUND FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN A PAYDAY LOAN WHICH SAYS THERE SHOULD BE NO EXTRA CHARGE FOR EXCEEDING THE LIMIT IS A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JO LINE
LAST YEAR THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY PUT A KAPPA ZERO POINT EIGHT PERCENT AND HOW MUCH PAYDAY LENDERS COULD CHARGE THEIR CUSTOMERS PER DAY BUT RESEARCH FROM WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SOME MAINSTREAM LENDERS ARE CHARGING CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THAT CAP IF SOMEONE EXCEEDS THEIR AGREED OVERDRAFT LIMIT BY ONE HUNDRED POUNDS IN A MONTH BANKS SUCH AS A BS AND LLOYD'S APPLY A CHARGE OF UP TO NINETY
THE CONSUMER GROUP SAYS THAT FIGURE COULD BE EVEN HIGHER IF INTEREST IS APPLIED OR IF THE BORROWING SPANS TWO SEPARATE CHARGING PERIODS ARE B'S WHICH APPLIES THE HIGHEST FEES ACCORDING TO WHICH SAID ON APPROVED OVERDRAFTS WERE AN EXPENSIVE METHOD OF BORROWING AND URGED CUSTOMERS TO USE ITS ACT NOW ALERT SERVICE TO REDUCE BORROWING COSTS
IT'S A MATCH THAT LADY THATCHER ENDED HER BITTER FEUD WITH SIR EDWARD HEATH FIVE YEARS BEFORE HE DIED BY PRAISING HIM AS ONE OF OUR GREATEST PRIME MINISTERS MARGARET THATCHER'S SERVED AS EDUCATION SECRETARY DURING SIR EDWARD'S PREMIERSHIP BUT FELL OUT WITH HIM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE A RADIO FOUR DOCUMENTARY HAS DISCOVERED THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER IN A SPEECH AT A PRIVATE DINNER LADY THATCHER PAY TRIBUTE TO ONE OF HER FIERCEST CRITICS SHAWNEE REPORTS
MARGARET THATCHER DEFEATED EDWARD HEATH IN A CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP ELECTION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE PAVING THE WAY FOR HER TO BECOME BRITAIN'S FIRST WOMAN PRIME MINISTER THATCHERITES BLAMED HIM FOR ABANDONING FREE MARKET POLICIES DURING HIS TIME IN OFFICE IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES HE ACCUSE THEM OF ACCEPTING RISING UNEMPLOYMENT IN ORDER TO CURB INFLATION
BUT IN THIS SPEECH RECORDED IN TWO THOUSAND AT A PRIVATE DINNER MARKING THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY IF HE'S BECOMING PRIME MINISTER AND NEVER BEFORE MADE PUBLIC LADY THATCHER HEAPS LAVISH PRAISE ON HER PREDECESSOR
NO
YEAH I NOTICE SORRY SHE TOLD FELLOW VETERANS OF THE HEATH CABINET THAT HE'D BEEN ONE OF THE PARTIES MOST DETERMINED LEADERS AND ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST INNOVATIVE PRIME MINISTERS
OH YEAH
HE WAS BORN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO TODAY WAS NICKNAMED THE INCREDIBLE SULK FOR HIS ATTACKS ON THE WOMAN WHO SUCCEEDED HIM UNTIL NOW FEW PEOPLE HAD BEEN AWARE HOW THEIR FEUD WAS FINALLY BROUGHT TO AN END AND YOU CAN HEAR THE ARCHIVE ON FALL THE HEATH ENIGMA TONIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON RADIO FOUR
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN HULL HAVE TAKEN PART IN A PIECE OF PERFORMANCE ART THIS MORNING BY POSING NAKED AND PAINTING THEMSELVES BLUE TO REPRESENT WATER THEY POSED IN THE STREET FOR THE AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER SPENCER TUNICK ARRANGE THE WORK SEE OF HULL THE PHOTOS WILL BE SHOWN DURING HULL CITY OF CULTURE TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS STAGED SIMILAR PIECES OF NUDE PERFORMANCE ART IN SYDNEY AND ON TYNESIDE
THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE TIMES REPORTS THIS MORNING THAT ANDREA LEAD SOME WHO'S FIGHTING TO REZA MADE FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAVE SAID BEING A MOTHER GIVES HER AN EDGE OVER MISSUS MAY SHE SAYS THAT IS GUTTER JOURNALISM AND SHE'S DISGUSTED BY THE TIMES REPORTING WILL ELEANOR GOW IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT MORNING ELLEN GOOD MORNING
SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY USE THE WORD EDGE IN THE TIMES DOES USE EDGE BUT BUT APART FROM THAT THE TIMES REPORTING IS ACCURATE ISN'T IT IT SEEMS TO BE FROM WHAT THE TIMES HAS RELEASED IN A VERY SHORT EXTRACT THAT WAS TWEETED BY THE PAPERS DEPUTY EDITOR ACCORDING TO THE TIMES ANDREW LETS AND SAYS I'M SURE TERESA WILL BE REALLY SAD SHE DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN SO I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE ANDREA HAS CHILDREN THERESA HASN'T BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY HORRIBLE BUT THEN THE PAPER GOES ON TO QUOTE HER AS SAYING
MISSUS MAY POSSIBLY HAS NIECES NEPHEWS LOTS OF PEOPLE BUT I HAVE CHILDREN WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN WHO WILL DIRECTLY BE PART OF WHAT HAPPENS NEXT AND SHE SAYS I FEEL AT BEING A MUM MEANS YOU HAVE A VERY REAL STAKE IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY ARE TANGIBLE STEAK NO IT'S PROMPTED A FURIOUS RESPONSE FROM ANDREA LED SOME SHE'S DEMANDED OF ATTRACTION AS SHE SAID THE STORY WAS APPALLING THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT SHE SAID
AND SHE SHE ALSO DEMANDED THAT THEY RELEASE THE FULL INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT WELL WE HAVE HEARD A LARGE A LARGE JUNK WE HAVE HEARD SOME OF IT UNEDITED AND SHE CLEARLY DID SAY WHAT WHAT YOU'VE JUST QUOTED HER AS SAYING SO ONE WONDERS QUITE WHY THIS IS LED SOME IS TAKING THIS APPROACH I MEAN YOU COULD UNDERSTAND IT IF SHE WERE TRYING TO FINESSE IN A BIT AND SAY WHAT I REALLY WAS
BUT TO CALL IT DISGUSTING YES AND TO TRY AND DIRECTLY PULL BACK COMPLETELY FROM THE QUOTES COMPLETELY WE KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY SHE IS A MUM OF THREE BUT ALSO THAT ARE MOST SPOKEN PRETTY RECENTLY ABOUT HER AND HER HUSBAND NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN IT JUST TELL ME IF YOU WOULD WHY IS THIS SUCH A TOXIC SUBJECT ANYWAY IS IT BECAUSE
ONE CANDIDATE SAYING OF ANOTHER CANDIDATE OH SHE HASN'T GOT KIDS THEREFORE ABSOLUTE SHE'S INSIDE THIS ISN'T WHAT SHE WAS SAYING BUT BUT I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU THAT THIS IS WHY THERE'S SO MUCH HEAT AROUND IT THEREFORE BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN SHE'S NOT FIT X. Y. AND Z. IS THAT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
WELL I THINK WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS WHETHER BEING A MOTHER MAKES YOU A BETTER PRIME MINISTER OR NOT AND WHETHER IT IS RIGHT TO USE THAT TO TRY AND PROPEL YOURSELF FORWARD IN WHAT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE A PRETTY TOUGH FIGHT TO BE THE NEXT LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND OBVIOUSLY ALSO PRIME MINISTER AND GARNERING FROM THE REACTION THAT WE'VE SEEN THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON SAYING I'M CHILDLESS I'VE GOT NIECES AND NEPHEWS I THINK I HAVE A VERY REAL STAKE IN OUR COUNTRY THE TREASURY MINISTER DAVID GORK SAID
AN APOLOGY IS DUE THIS IS VERBAL CLUMSINESS WILL THAT'S MAYBE O.K. NOT A CALCULATION BUT IF IT'S THE LATTER THEN YUK SO THERE'S BEEN A PRETTY STRONG REACTION TO WHAT ANDREA LET'S AND HAS SAID
AND REMEMBER JOHN IT WAS A REALLY FRACTIOUS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THERE HAVE BEEN THESE CALLS FOR UNITY AFTERWARDS BUT RIP IT JUST SHOWS THAT THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP RACES AFTER A VERY CONTROVERSIAL START IS ELEANOR THANKS A LOT WILL BE PURSUING THIS LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN BOMB MAKING EQUIPMENT RIFLES AND AMMUNITION HAD BEEN FOUND AT THE HOME OF MICHAEL JOHNSON THE ARMY RESERVIST WHO SHOT DEAD FIVE POLICEMEN IN DALLAS ON THURSDAY NIGHT LAURA BAKER A CORRESPONDENT IS IN THE CITY AND TOLD ME THE LATEST
WE'VE FOUND IT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE GARDEN IN HIMSELF TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD ED MICA JOHNSON IS AN ARMY VETERAN HE WAS OBVIOUSLY
THE MAN AT THE CENTRE OF THIS DALLAS POLICE SHOOTING IT SEEMS TO BE THAT HE AMASSED SECULAR PERSONAL ARSENAL AT THIS IT'S A WARM IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF DALLAS BOMB MAKING MATERIAL WAS BULLETPROOF VESTS
RIFLES AMMUNITION HE ALSO HAD A JOURNAL OF COMBAT TACTICS HE HAD SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN IN THE PAST AND HE WAS NO LONGER IN THE ARMY AND IT DID SEEM THAT HE MAY HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF WEAPONS WITH HIM ON THE ROOF THERE WAS A BIT OF CONFUSION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS
THE ONLY GARDEN BUT IT'S NOW BELIEVED THAT CERTAIN WE EVEN THOUGH THE HAD THREE OTHERS IN CUSTODY IT CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL JOHNSON IS THE ONLY MAN BEHIND THESE ATTACKS WEATHER TRIGGERS THE DEATHS OF THEIR LAND AGUS DEALAN ALTON STERLING IS CERTAINLY THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD OFFICERS DURING THE STAND OFF A FOUR HOUR STAND OFF BETWEEN OFFICERS AND HIMSELF HE TOLD A POLICE NEGOTIATOR THAT HE WANTED TO KILL WHITE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WHITE POLICE OFFICER
HIS FACEBOOK PAGE SEEMS TO BE LINKED TO A NUMBER OF EXTREMIST GROUPS BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BELONG TO ANY OF THEM AND THE AMOUNT OF MOBILE PHONE FOOTAGE OF WHAT DALLAS WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN DALLAS ON THURSDAY NIGHT IS EXTRAORDINARY THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN POSTED ONLINE NOW SEE WHERE THIS ENTIRE FEW DAYS SEEMS TO HAVE PLAYED OUT OF SOMEONE'S CAMERA WHETHER IT BE AN EYEFUL WE KNOW WHETHER IT BE ON FACEBOOK OR WHETHER IT BE ON TWITTER
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THIS WEEK HAS SHOCKED AMERICANS THIS REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE TENSIONS ARE BEGINNING TO RISE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THINGS MOVE FORWARD CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE ON BOTH SIDES YOU HAVE A POLICE SERVICE HERE WHO ARE TRYING TO HEAL HERE ARE TRYING TO MOURN THE LOSS OF FIVE OF THEIR OWN AND ON THE OTHER SIDE PROTESTS THROUGHOUT THIS EVENING EVEN AS I SPEAK
ARE CONTINUING THE STREETS IN ATLANTA IN BATON ROUGE LOUISIANA IN NEW YORK ARE STILL FILLED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO PROTEST AGAINST WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS POLICE BRUTALITY AGAINST THE BLACK COMMUNITY LAW REBECCA THANKS VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN SHOOK THE RIGHT OF PARLIAMENT TO VOTE BEFORE THE NATION GOES TO WAR BE ENSHRINED IN LAW HOUSE OF LORDS DEBATED THAT YESTERDAY AND A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT MARK DARCY WAS THERE
IN THE WEEK OF THE CHILCOTT REPORT A LIB DEM PEER HAS CALLED FOR NEW CURVES ON A PRIME MINISTERS TO ORDER MILITARY ACTION LADY FAULKNER OF MARGARET VAIN SAID THAT THE EXISTING CONVENTIONS SET BY TONY BLAIR'S DECISION TO HOLD A VOTE ON IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WERE UNCERTAIN AND SERVICE PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES NEEDED TO SEE DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DECISIONS TO GO TO WAR SO WHERE DOES DEMOCRACIES STAND WHEN NO ONE IS CULPABLE
AND ALL WE'RE ACTING IN AN INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY
DEMOCRACY STANDS DIMINISHED MY LORDS BUT SOD SO TOO DO THE PEOPLE'S ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE
THE COUNTRY EXPECTS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE
SHE PROPOSED A BRITISH WAR POWERS ACT WHICH WOULD REQUIRE PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL FOR MILITARY ACTION SO M.P.S COULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AT GENERAL ELECTIONS BUT WHICH WOULD STILL GIVE HER PRIME MINISTER ALL THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED IN EMERGENCIES THE FAMILIES OF SERVICE PERSONNEL WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN IRAQ DESERVE NO LESS SHE SAID AFTER CHILCO
THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT ONE LESSON OF THAT WAR HAS BEEN HEAT
NEVER AGAIN SO BE COUNTRY SHED BLOOD AND TREASURE ON THE BASIS OF SOFA
I'M INADEQUATE AND HURRIED INFORMATION AND PROCESS
THIS FILM IS AN ATTEMPT TO SHOW GREATER DELIBERATION BY ALL
THAT IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO AS A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO THOSE GREAT GIVEN
THE CONSERVATIVE LORD ROWBOTHAM A FORMER ARMY OFFICER RECALLED THE TWENTY THIRTEEN COMMONS VOTE ON INTERVENTION IN SYRIA WHERE THE GOVERNMENT HAD ARGUED THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY THE ASCENT REGIME JUSTIFIED MILITARY ACTION BUT WAS THEN DEFEATED DIGS THE TORIES THAT REBELLED FOR INSTANCE NO MORE ABOUT CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN THE GULF
I THINK BECAUSE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO BE AS WELL INFORMED AS MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT BUT WE MUST LEAVE
SUCH DECISIONS TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND WE MUST TRUST HER
A CONSERVATIVE FLAWED FRAMLINGHAM SAW ANOTHER PROBLEM ISN'T THERE A BASIC CONUNDRUM HERE REALLY THAT LONG AND DETAILED DEBATE OF IT ACTUALLY WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO TAKE AGAINST
GIVES HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE EXACTLY HOW HE'S GOING TO DEAL WITH IT WHAT I ACCEPT IT IN A WAY IT'S NECESSARY IT IS A PROBLEM TOO
THE CROSS PENSHAW INDEPENDENT PEER LADY DEECH THOUGHT M.P.S COULD COME UNDER ATTACK FOR THE WAY THEY VOTED WHEN I WAS A VOTE ON AIR STRIKES INSIST ON OVER SYRIA
SIXTY SIX LABOUR M.P.S VOTED IN FAVOUR
AND VERY PERSONALLY RECEIVED OPPROBRIUM UNPLEASANT EMAILS AND
AND IT SEEMS TO BE NOT RIGHT THAT INDIVIDUAL M.P.S SHOULD HAVE ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND THE WEIGHT OF THOSE DECISIONS
BUT LABOUR'S SHADOW DEFENCE SPOKESMAN TO EAT WELCOME THE BILL THERE'S BEEN ADRIFT SOMETIMES NOT IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS BUT A DRIFT TOWARDS ADDING MORE AND MORE POWERS TO THE EXECUTIVE
AT THE EXPENSE OF PARLIAMENT AND THEREFORE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE RIGHTS OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO HOLD ITS ELECTED GOVERNMENT TO HER
THIS BILL IS SMALL BIT HE'S WORTHY I THINK OF SUPPORT BECAUSE IT ATTEMPTS TO PLACE A CHECK ON THAT
THE DEFENCE MINISTER LORD HOWE QUOTED THE VERDICT ON THE ISSUE OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL CONSTITUTION COMMITTEE IT FOUND THAT THE EXISTING CONVENTION
WAS THE BEST MEANS BY WHICH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CAN EXERCISE CONTROL OVER DECISIONS TO U.S. FORCE
THAT PARLIAMENTS ROLL SHOULD NOT BE FORMALISED BY WAY OF LEGISLATION OR RESOLUTION
AND THAT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORMAL ISATION OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS BUT AS IS USUAL IN THE LORDS NO ONE ATTEMPTED TO BLOCK THE BILL HE NOW GOES FORWARD FOR DETAILED CONSIDERATION
MARK DARCY REPORTING AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE THAN WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT ON ONE LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO AND THAT'LL BE JUST AFTER TEN TO NINE AT THIS MORNING IT'S COMING UP TO TWENTY PAST SEVEN NOW HOW WILL HISTORY BOOKS CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE CHILCOT REPORT'S FINDINGS THIS WEEK BOTH IN WHAT'S SAID ABOUT THE MILITARY'S ROLE AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES WAS MAX HASTINGS IS A MILITARY HISTORIAN AND FORMER EDITOR OF THE TELEGRAPH
AND HE'S WITH US ON THE LINE AND KATHY BURKE IS A PROFESSOR OF MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY HISTORY U.C.L. GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH BOYS AS SIR MAX HASTINGS YOU WROTE THIS WEEK THAT ONE OF THE MOST DISTRESSING FEATURES OF THE CHILCOTT REPORT WAS ITS VERDICT ON THE ROLE OF THE ARMY IN THEY'RE GOING TO WAR
I'M AFRAID IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE IT IN MY VIEW TOO MUCH FOR THE ATTENTION OF ARTISTS
THE ROLE OF TONY BLAIR WHICH FRANKLY WE HAVEN'T DONE A GREAT DEAL FROM CHALK AT THAT WE HAVE KNOWN FOR GOOD
MORE NEEDS TO FOCUS I BELIEVE ON THE EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE TO WHICH GROUP
IN ADVANCE OF THE DECISION TO GO TO WAR BUT IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE ENTIRE CABINET
THE ALI SHEAVES OF ALL BOWEN LION UP BEHIND TEAM TONY NOW I DO THINK BIG PROPOSAL WE WERE
ABOUT UPPER LEGISLATION YOU CAN'T LEGISLATE TO PREVENT A PRIME MINISTER DO YOU HAVE A ROTTEN
WHAT YOU CAN DO IS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIRST OF THE BRITISH
THE WORKS ARE GREAT YOUR BUT IT DID IN THE PAST AND IT'S VERY TALKING BUT HERE WE HAVE THE CHIEFS OF STAFF WHO WILL BE COMPLAINING TO GIRL GOT TO BE RIGHTLY BUT THE ARMPIT
VERY ODD A RESOURCE NOT VERY SMALL A VERY LIMITED CAPABILITY AND YET I QUOTE ONE OF
BALL WITH THE CHALK AT THE INQUIRY YOU SAID TO ME BUT SHE STOPPED WOULD GAGGING
THEY WERE PAINTING TO GET INVOLVED IN MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ
THEY APPOINT AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW WHAT THEY COULD DO TO WORK ALONGSIDE THE AMERICANS ALL USUAL THING FOR PEOPLE
IT WAS ONE GLOWING HISTORICAL LESSON OR NOT GLOWING BECAUSE IT'S A TERRIBLY SAD
THE BRITISH ARMED FORCES THAT ARE VERY SMALL
THEY HAVE A VERY LIMITED CAPABILITY BUT SHEAVES AND STOP HAVE A DUTY TO BE MUCH MORE
WE WERE THE PUBLIC WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ABOUT THE BAY NO LIMITS OF WHAT THEY CAME STREAMING A MILITARY OPERATION SUPPORT
ALTHOUGH IT HAS TO BE SAID BUT IT'S RATHER DEPRESSING TO A FLAT
HE WAS CUTE PANTS STOP SEB APPARATUS SLIP HIM A WARNING
ABOUT THE EXTREMELY QUESTIONABLE
OF LEADING AN INTERVENTION INTO LOOK
REMOVE GADDAFI AND ALSO WARNED HIM ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN GETTING INVOLVED IN SORRY
THANK YOU THE PRIME MINISTER TOOK ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO LEGISLATE ABOUT
BUT WE WE'VE GOT TO TRY TO SEE THE SYSTEM
THE VOICES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE IN MY DECISION MAKING LOOP OF MORE CLEARLY EXPRESSED
AND KATHLEEN PRESS ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE COVERAGE THAT THE HEADLINE EFFECTIVELY THESE TWO POINT SIX MILLION WORDS WAS THE LINE THAT WE NOW KNOW THAT TONY BLAIR SAID TO GEORGE BUSH WHICH WAS I WILL BE WITH YOU WHATEVER WHICH IN A WAY PLAYED INTO THE WHOLE WAY THAT WE FEEL ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NIGHT UNITED STATES
WELL WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT SENT A SECOND WORLD WAR THE MAJOR DEFENCE POLICY SECURITY POLICY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS BEEN A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES AND THIS IS NOT SURPRISING WHEN YOU THINK OF OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN WHAT WAS THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENING I TAKE IT I AGREE WITH SOME OUR ACCEPT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BENT THAT THEY WERE KEEN TO DO IT BUT HE
THE THING IS THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS TONY BLAIR A POODLE I THINK THAT'S REALLY QUITE A CHILDISH THING TO JUST SAY HE BELIEVED IN HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION IF IT WORKED IN THE END THE VULCANS IT HAD WORKED IN SIERRA LEONE LEONE OBVIOUSLY HE HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH GEORGE BUSH BUT TO HAVE THAT SORT OF SECURITY BACK IN YOU HAVE TO BE A DEPENDABLE ALLY SO THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ARGUE AGAINST
HAVING A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES NOT ARGUING FOR IT HAVING SETTLED OUT OF COURT NO HAVE IT HAVING SAID THAT JUST A SECOND HAVING SAID THAT I AGREE VERY MUCH THAT IT WAS NOT CHALLENGE YOU'VE GOT TO BE QUESTIONED CERTAINLY IN WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK THE AMBASSADOR AND INDEED THE AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS ARE FREQUENTLY
CHALLENGE WHAT'S HAPPENING SO I BUT I ALSO MUST AGREE THAT THE WAY IT WAS DONE IN DOWNING STREET LEAVES SHALL WE SAY MUCH TO BE A DESIGN O.K. BUT ALSO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AT THE BRITISH EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON WAS CHALLENGING THINGS WELL CERTAINLY THEY WERE CHALLENGING ANNETTE AND IF THEY DON'T GET INVOLVED IN
THE DETAILED INTER AGENCY BUT THE BRITISH EMBASSY AS ALWAYS IT'S TAKING FOR GRANTED THEY'RE GOING TO BE THEY'RE GOING TO BE AT INTO THE DISCUSSIONS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING EXCITING AND DIFFERENT WITH TONY BLAIR WE CAN'T BE ON THAT IF I WATCH AS THE CONCLUSION AT ALL
THAT BRITAIN'S SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT BE ON
OH I I AGREE WITH THAT I AGREE WITH THAT BUT I I DO HOLD TO MY MAIN POINT THAT'S A SENSOR AT THE UNITED STATES THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES IS THE ABSOLUTE FOUNDATION OF BRITISH ABILITY TO DO THINGS IN THE WORLD SHALL WE SAY THEY DON'T MAKE HER A MILITARY EXPEDITION WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE INDEED
THE ACQUIESCENCE AND THE HELP OF THE UNITED STATES YOU HEAD IT HAS TO BE A REASON NOT TO GO ALONG IF YOU'RE GOING TO IF YOU'RE GOING TO IT SO IT WAS VERY MUCH THE ONE LEAVING GRANTLY
DURING HIS PREMIERSHIP WAS TO KEEP BRITAIN OUT OF THE VIETNAM WAR ABSOLUTELY BUT IT WAS IT WAS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE THE DOMESTIC SUPPORT OR CAN I MAKE A SORT OF SWEET SIR MAX HASTINGS KATHLEEN BURK PROFESSOR BUT THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH

IN A IN A CAFE IN IN INTERVIEWING HER ABOUT WHAT YES HERE IN COSTA COFFEE IN MILTON KEYNES STATION SO THE QUALITY OF THE ORGY MAY NOT IT'S NOT IT WASN'T AN INTERVIEW DONE FOR BROADCAST BUT OH IT WAS A WIDE RANGING INTERVIEW FOR OUR SATURDAY INTERVIEW SLOTS YOU KNOW TO DO WITH HER LEADERSHIP CONTEST AND I ASKED HER VERY DIRECTLY WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOU AND THERESA MAY BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE TWO WOMEN RUNNING FOR THE JOB YOU KNOW NEXT PRIME MINISTER'S GOING TO BE A WOMAN
AND HER ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER AND THERESA MAY SHE SAID FIRST OF ALL ECONOMIC COMPETENCE BECAUSE OF HER BACKGROUND IN THE CITY AND THEN SHE SAID FAMILY SHE SAID YOU KNOW HER KIDS WHO HUGE PART OF HER LIFE
YOU KNOW SHE ALSO HAD BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND IT WAS BEING PART OF A HUGE FAMILY THAT MADE HER VERY GROUNDED AND NORMAL LIKE IT WAS ALL RIGHT SO I THEN SAID TO HER I REMEMBERED THAT DURING THE TELEVISION DEBATES IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM THAT SHE FREQUENTLY TALKED ABOUT AS A MUM SHE THOUGHT THIS OUT OR ANY OTHER AND I REMEMBER ONE POINT RIZ DAVIDSON EVEN SETTLE ACTUALLY THEIR MUMS AND DADS ON THE SIDE OF THE DEBATE TOO
SO I SAID TO HER WELL DO YOU THINK MOTHERHOOD INFORMS YOUR POLITICS RIGHT AND SHE HAS SHE'S CHALLENGE WHAT YOU HAVE SAID ABOUT SHE'S ASKED FOR A TRANSCRIPT SO WE HAVE GOT YOUR AUDIO FROM THIS INTERVIEW LET'S HEAR A CLIP FROM
LIKE HER MUM AN IMPOLITIC YEAH WHY BILLY AND BETTY

MAYBE NAIVETY RATHER THAN ANYTHING MALICIOUS BUT I DO THINK THAT JUDGEMENT IN CHARACTER IN THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AND THEREFORE THIS IS A LEGITIMATE THING TO WRITE UP AND IN TERMS OF HOW IT WILL PLAY
I MEAN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS THERE IS THAT QUESTION OF IT BEING PERSONAL ART AND ART AT A POINT WHEN THE PARTY HAS TALKED ABOUT UNITING BUT IT MAY ALSO WHAT SHE'S SAYING THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WHO LISTEN AND THINK SHE'S RIGHT

SO I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION IT COULD CATER ADVANTAGE BUT I THINK ALSO THAT THE BIGGER QUESTION REALLY IS ARE YOU REALLY SAYING THAT WOMEN IN POLITICS WITHOUT CHILDREN ARE LESS CAPABLE OR LESS ABLE TO DO THINGS PROPERLY HOW SHE KNOWS SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY PUBLIC SHE'S TWEETED TO SAY IT WAS A COMPLETE THIS IS THE CAN THE WAVERING UP IS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU SAID WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE RELEASING THIS ORDEAL HAD THERE'VE BEEN COMPLAINTS TO THE PAPER

YOU KNOW IT'S FOR HER ANY CLAIM SHE ACTUALLY SAID THAT BUT I WAS BAFFLED BY IT AND ANY COMMENTS FROM THERESA MAY
NOT FOR HER NOT THAT I KNOW ABOUT RACHEL SYLVESTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT LOADS OF OTHER STUFF ABOUT THE TORY LEADERSHIP CONTEST IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF COURSE CHOOSING BETWEEN MISSUS MAY LEAD SOME AS MANY OF THEM POINT OUT IS THE TASK OF ORDINARY TORY MEMBERS SEVERAL PAPERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE THINKING THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAVE BEEN TO CLITHEROE IN LANCASHIRE WHERE IT FOUND SOME STRONG EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT FOR MISSUS LET'S HAVE IT IS A GAP
BETWEEN WESTMINSTER AND THE RANK AND FILE IT SAYS THE GUARDIAN'S MEAN TO FLEET IN HAMPSHIRE ZOE WILLIAMS FOUND MIXED VIEWS AMONG CONSERVATIVE VOTERS RATHER THAN MEMBERS SHE'S JUST WHILE MISSUS EXCUSE ME ONE THIS IS ME MIGHT SEEM A PERFECT FIT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES THE FAITHFUL NEVER GO QUIETLY INTO COMMONSENSE MATTHEW PARIS IN THE TIMES CALLS HIMSELF A GRASSROOTS STORY THINKS A MAJORITY WILL WITH PERHAPS A LITTLE SIGH VOTE FOR MISSUS MADE AMONG
ALMOST ALL THE PAPERS DISPLAY PICTURES OF THE SHOOTINGS IN DALLAS UNDER THE HEADLINE AMERICA'S RACE HATE NIGHTMARE THE AYE AYE HAS AN IMAGE OF SEVEN POLICE OFFICERS SHELTERING BEHIND A CRUMB CONCRETE WALL AS THEY EXCHANGED SHOTS WITH THE ATTACKER THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE VIOLENCE HAS LEFT AMERICA REELING THE MIRROR SAYS THE U.S. HAS PUT GUNS IN THE HANDS OF THE DISTURBED ANGRY AND EVIL AND THE BLOODSHED LET'S BLOODSHED WILL END ONLY ONCE IT HAS BEEN DISARMED THE SONS THINKS THAT AMERICA IS ON THE BRINK OF A LONG HOT SUMMER INFLAMED BY SEETHING RACIAL TENSIONS
THE DAILY MAIL FEELS THAT THE RACIAL FAULT LINE THAT CUTS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES HAS JUST WIDENED EVEN FURTHER THE TELEGRAPH REPORTS THAT A PIECE OF MEDICAL RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT MANY CANCER PATIENTS MAY BENEFIT FROM TAKING STATINS EXCESS THE STUDY APPEARED TO SHOW THAT CHOLESTEROL REDUCING DRUGS MIGHT LOWER THE DEATH RATES AMONG PEOPLE WITH BREAST LUNG PROSTATE AND BOWEL CANCERS BUT THE MILLER SAYS OTHER CANCER EXPERTS ARE DOUBTFUL IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT PATIENTS WILL BENEFIT
PICTURES OF A SWEATY AND EXULTANT ANDY MURRAY CELEBRATE HIM REACHING A THIRD WIMBLEDON FINAL THE TIMES POINTS OUT THAT HE WON'T BE FACING EITHER ROGER FEDERER OR NOVAK DJOKOVIC THE TELEGRAPH CALLED HIM UNSTOPPABLE AND THE GUARDIAN CALLS HIM IMPERIOUS SUGGESTING HE'S HEADING ON CRUISE CONTROL FOR A SECOND TITLE BY DAY DOCTOR ANGUS BOWIE TEACHES CLASSICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD THIS MORNING IN A LETTER TO THE TIMES HE APPLIES HIS SKILL IN LANGUAGES TO THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST IT'D NOT IRONIC
HE ASKS THAT THE TWO CONTENDERS TO GUIDE US IN OUR BRECK'S IT SHOULD HAVE A EUROPEAN NAMES
IT'S NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THIS WEEK'S MEET THE AUTHOR INTERVIEW GEMMA'S BEEN TALKING JIM NOTTIE AS IF YOU NEEDED TELLING HAS BEEN TALKING TO ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST SENIOR JUDGES LORD SOME ABOUT HIS OTHER CAREER AS AN HISTORIAN OF THE ONE HUNDRED YEARS WAR
AS A LAWYER AND NOW A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT LORD SOME SHEN JONATHAN SOME SHEN HAS PURSUED A PRIVATE PASSION
IN THE LATE SEVENTIES HE BEGAN A HISTORY OF ONE HUNDRED YEARS WAR THAT EMBROILED ENGLAND AND FRANCE UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY THE FORCE VOLUME JUST OUT IN PAPERBACK IS CALLED CURSED KINGS
AND IN PART IT TELLS THE STORY OF HENRY THE FIFTH THAT FABLED KING WHO DIED AT THE AGE OF THIRTY SIX JUST BEFORE HE WAS GOING TO BECOME KING OF FRANCE AS WELL AS
THIS IS HISTORY IN THE GRAND MANNER THRILLING NARRATIVE RICH DESCRIPTIONS OF ROYAL COURTS AND BATTLEFIELDS AND ABOVE ALL A COLOURFUL POLITICAL TAPESTRY OF TWO COUNTRIES DIVIDED BY DIFFERENT STRUGGLES FOR POWER
AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE KING ENTERED THE CITY OVER LONDON BRIDGE IT WAS THE MOST EXUBERANT ROYAL INTEREST SINCE THE RETURN OF THE BLACK PRINCE AFTER THE POINT ACTUALLY CAMPAIGN MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY BEFORE THE PAGEANT WHICH GREETED HIM WAS A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE THEMES EXPANDED IN THE CHANCELLOR'S ADDRESSED TO PARLIAMENT
THE CITY WAS DECKED OUT WITH GIANT ALLEGORICAL FIGURES OF DAVID AND GOLIATH AND TABLEAU VIVANT OF ANGELS PROPHETS APOSTLES AND KING'S MARTYRS AND CONFESSORS OF ENGLAND
TIMBER ARCHERS AND TOWERS A DOOR ONTO THE STREETS BANNERS STRETCHED ACROSS THE CARRIAGEWAY IS BEARING MOTTOS REPEATING THE THEME OF CHANCELLOR BOTH WHAT'S A DRESS TO PARLIAMENT WELCOME HENRY THE FIFTH KING OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS PERIOD DID TO FRANCE
AND TO ENGLAND BECAUSE THAT IS AS MUCH OF FRANCE IN HERE AS THE ROSE OF ENGLAND IT'S THE STORY OF TWO DIVIDED KINGDOMS FRANCE FIRST
IT'S AS MUCH A STORY OF FRENCH DEFEAT AS OF ENGLISH VICTORY IN FRANCE'S HISTORY IT IS ONE OF THE TWO OCCASIONS
THE OTHER BEING NINETEEN FORTY WHEN THE STATE HAS EFFECTIVELY INTERNALLY COLLAPSED AND ENABLED A FOREIGN POWER PARTIALLY TO OCCUPY ITS TERRITORY
THAT IS A CATASTROPHIC EVENT PSYCHOLOGICALLY IN THE HISTORY OF ANY COUNTRY AND THE SCARS LASTED IN FRANCE FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT'S PROBABLY THE ORIGIN OF THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME WHICH SWITCH THE KING'S CONSTRUCTED OVER THE NEXT THREE CENTURIES PARTLY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY NEVER SUFFERED SUCH A THING AGAIN
AND AS FAR AS ENGLAND IS CONCERNED HENRY THE FIFTH SUCCEEDING HENRY THE FOURTH WHO HAD DEPOSED RICHARD THE SECOND
WHERE HAD WE GOT TO IN THE WAY THAT THIS COUNTRY DEVELOPED BY THE TIME WE WERE AT LET'S SAY THAT THE MIDDLE OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
ENGLAND HAD A VERY RECENT HISTORY OF CIVIL WAR AND THEY WERE THE LATE MIDDLE AGES ENGLAND KILLED FOUR OF ITS KINGS HOW DEPOSE FOUR OF ITS KINGS ONE OF THEM TWICE
THIS WAS A UNIQUE RECORD IN EUROPEAN HISTORY AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT HENRY THE FIFTH
HAD MANAGED PARTLY AS A RESULT OF AGINCOURT TO UNIFY HIS COUNTRY BEHIND HIM IN THE WAR OF AGGRESSION AND CONQUEST AGAINST FRANCE WHICH BRIEFLY BROUGHT TREMENDOUS DIVIDENDS
AND THAT AGAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE CRITICAL MOMENTS IN ENGLISH HISTORY ALONG WITH THE ARMADA THE DEFEAT OF NAPOLEON THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN
SO ON AS SHAKESPEARE REALISED AND DRAMATISED DO YOU STILL FEEL YOURSELF STIRRED
WHEN YOU HEAR HENRY ON THE BATTLEFIELD WITH WORDS PUT IN HIS MOUTH BY SHAKESPEARE OF COURSE THE SAINT CRISPIN'S DAY SPEECH IS ONE OF THEM
GREAT PIECES OF PATRIOTIC ORATORY AND THE WHOLE OF THE SHAKESPEARE CANON IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR THIS THESE WORDS WITHOUT FEELING A CERTAIN TINGLE HOWEVER HARD NOSED
WE FEEL WE HAPPY FEW WE BAND OF BROTHERS
HE TODAY THAT SHEDS HIS BLOOD WITH ME SHALL BE MY BROTHER
SO VILE THIS DAY SHALL GENTLE HIS CONDITION
AND GENTLEMEN IN ENGLAND NOW ABED SHALL THINK THEMSELVES ARE CURSED THEY WERE NOT HERE AND HOLD THEIR MANHOOD CHEAP WHILES ANY SPEAKS THAT FOUGHT WITH US UPON SAINT CRISPIN'S DAY WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD HE BECOME KING
I THINK THAT IF HIS GREAT PROJECT HAD SUCCEEDED AND HE HAD MANAGED TO DEFEATS THE DELPHI AND UNITE FRANCE UNDER HIS RULE ENGLAND WOULD HAVE BECOME A COLONY OF FRANCE
WE WOULD HAVE LOST OUR NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN YOKED TOGETHER WITH A COUNTRY WHICH WAS ENORMOUSLY RICHER AND MORE POPULOUS THAN OUR OWN AND OUR KINGS WOULD GRADUALLY HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE FRENCH THEY WOULD HAVE MOVED TO THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF POWER AND EVENTUALLY I SUSPECT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A WAR OF INDEPENDENCE
SO BY THE ROLL OF THE DICE THE DEATH OF A YOUNG KING THAT WAS AVOIDED HE WAS LUCKY IN THE MOMENT OF HIS DEATH
YOU'RE A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT YOU WHAT A VERY BUSY LAWYER AT THE BAR WHEN YOU BEGAN TO WRITE THESE VOLUMES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE
HOW DID YOU MANAGE I MEAN DID YOU SIMPLY USE IT AS A BALLAST TO A BUSY PROFESSIONAL LIFE WELL THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MIDNIGHT OIL INVOLVED BUT EVERYBODY HAS ROOM IN THEIR LIVES FOR SOME CONSUMING INTEREST IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HOME DECORATING OR BELL RINGING BUT THIS IS MY INTEREST JONATHAN SUCTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH
JIM WITH LORD SUMPS THERE IT'S NOW THIRTY MINUTES BUT IT'S A TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN THE STUDIO THE REV AND RUB DOCTOR ROB MARSHALL GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SIR HOW ARE YOU
IT WAS PERHAPS THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE MORNING ON THIS PROGRAMME YESTERDAY WHEN THE REVEREND JESSE JACKSON TOLD JUSTIN THAT AMERICA IS IN AN UGLY MOOD RIGHT NOW PRESIDENT OBAMA IN WARSAW THIS WEEKEND FOR WHAT'S LIKELY TO BE HIS LAST NATO SUMMIT BEGGED HIS NATION TO CONFRONT RACIAL DISPARITIES IN POLICING LAST THAT KNOWLEDGE IN THE DANGERS OFFICERS FACE THIS HE SAID IS A MATTER FOR ALL OF US
A VIDEO FILM BY LAVISH REYNOLDS GIRLFRIEND OF PHILANDERER CASTILLE OR BLACK MAN SURELY AFTER SHORTLY AFTER HE WAS SHOT SEVERAL TIMES BY A POLICE OFFICER WHILE SITTING IN HIS CAR HAS GONE VIRAL HER PLEASE THAT SURELY HE CANNOT OF DIED IN THIS WAY LEAD IT WOULD SEEM TO THE OUTPOURING OF PROTEST IN THE ERUPTION OF VIOLENCE IN DALLAS WHERE ELEVEN POLICE OFFICERS WERE SHOT FIVE OF THEM FATALLY THE KILLER IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID HE WANTED TO TARGET WHITE PEOPLE
A WASHINGTON POST ONLINE MUSEUM REFLECTING ON OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY SUGGESTS THAT THE OPTIMISTIC AFTER GLOW OF THE DREAM OF A POST RACIAL AMERICA FOLLOWING HIS ELECTION AS PRESIDENT NOW SEEMS MISPLACED RACISM OF COURSE REMAINS A HUGELY COMPLEX ISSUE AND NOT JUST IN AMERICA
ADDRESSING THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF RACISM DEMANDS TREMENDOUS COURAGE AND HONESTY THERE WAS NEVER LETS FACE IT GOING TO BE THE KIND OF CHANGE SOME EXPECTED IN THE COURSE OF JUST TWO TERMS IN THE WHITE HOUSE
THE AMERICAN NETWORKS HAVE HAD PLENTY OF BLACK GOSPEL PREACHERS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS DECLARING RACISM AS A TERRIBLE SIN IT CAN HAVE NO PLACE THEY'VE BEEN PROCLAIMING IN A SOCIETY WHERE THE NOTION OF HUMAN FREEDOM IS LINKED TO REAL JUSTICE WHERE PEOPLE SHOW THEIR LOVE OF GOD BY HOW THEY TREAT THEIR NEIGHBOUR THE UNIQUE NATURE OF GOD'S LOVE BREAKS DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS WHICH HUMAN BEINGS ERECT THEY'VE BEEN SAYING THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF THE CREED THAT THEY'VE BEEN PROFESSING AND THE KNOB OF THE CHRISTIAN GOSPEL
INDEED ONE OF THE BEST SERMONS I EVER HEARD WAS ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU TELLING AN ABSOLUTELY PACK FOOTBALL STADIUM IN BRADFORD IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THAT THE COLOUR OF HIS SKIN WAS GOD'S GIFT TO HIM IT WAS JUST A PITY HE LAMENTED AS A PARTY BEGAN TO WADE IN SOUTH AFRICA THAT NOT EVERYONE SAW HIS BLACKNESS IN THE SAME WAY
AS VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ON ALL SIDES ARE REMEMBERED IN MANY PEOPLE'S PRAYERS TODAY MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR'S OBSERVATION THAT INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE CONTINUES TO CHALLENGE FOR THE SOUL OF THE PSYCHE OF AMERICA AND OF US ALL
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REV AND DOCTOR ROB MARSHALL IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO EIGHT COUPLE OF DAYS AGO M.P.S VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO GIVE PEOPLE FROM E.U. COUNTRIES LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY THE RIGHT TO RULE HERE EVEN AFTER WE HAVE LEFT THE E. U. TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE VOTES TO TWO BUT NEARLY ALL CONSERVATIVE M.P.S ABS STAINED SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS ANYONE REALLY SUGGESTING WE MIGHT DEPORT PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE LIVED HERE FOR MANY YEARS ANDY BURNHAM AS THE LABOUR M.P. WHO PROPOSED THE MOTION HE'S ON THE LINE MYSTERIES COFFEE
A CONSERVATIVE M.P. WHO SUPPORTS THERESA MAY AND HER BID FOR THE TORY LEADERSHIP MY BURNHAM WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THE VOTE
THE POINT OF THE VOTE JOHN WHO WAS TO TRY AND GIVE SOME SECURITY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE THERE'S THREE MILLION E.U. NATIONALS HERE BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE THE MUMS AND DADS OF BRITISH CHILDREN THEY WORK IN OUR PUBLIC SERVICES THEY RUN A COMPANIES AND NO ONE'S SHOULD BE DEPORTED UP THERE WELL YOU'VE GOT I'M AFRAID
WENT ON TO THE TELEVISION LAST WEEK AND MUDDIED THE WATERS SHE SAID THAT SHE COULDN'T SECURE THEIR STATUS UNTIL THE STATUS OF BRITISH NATIONALS LIVING ABROAD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED ALL THE E.U. COUNTRIES AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG WE COULDN'T THE GOVERNMENT COULD CLEAR THIS ISSUE UP STRAIGHTAWAY AND SAY THAT NOBODY WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE
THESE PEOPLE MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR SOCIETY TO OUR ECONOMY WE VALUE THEM THEY ARE WELCOME HERE BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT AND THIS IS ANOTHER EXAM RIGHT BUT THAT HEY OS WELL A COUNTRY IS IN POST REFERENDUM NOT THE TORY PARTY IS JUST SIMPLY NOT CLEARING UP IS IT IS IT IS IT CHAOS OR IS IT JUST THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE OF THE INEVITABLE NEGOTIATIONS AFTER ALL IF THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY
THAT THE BRITISH CITIZENS WHO LIVE ABROAD JUST AS OTHER E.U. CITIZENS LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY IF THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO LEAVE WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING IN OUR HAND DON'T WE A CARD THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PLAY IN THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT'S ALL THAT SHE IS SAYING THERESA MAY'S SAYING ISN'T IT
JOHN'S SURELY THE GOVERNMENT'S FIRST PRIORITY IS TO PEOPLE LIVING HERE PAYING TAXES HERE PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES WHO ARE WORKING IN OUR PUBLIC SERVICES CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMY THAT SECURE THEIR POSITION AND ACTUALLY I WOULD ARGUE BY DOING THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL BUILD GOODWILL AND TRUST WITH OTHER
E.U. COUNTRIES AND THAT IS MORE LIKELY THEN TO SECURE THE POSITION OF BRITISH NATIONALS LIVING ABROAD SO YES IT'S SECURED BOTH BUT I THINK THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS JUST BY CLEARING THIS ISSUE UP AND THE COMMONS THE CLEAR WE'LL HAVE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS TO DO THAT IF THE TORIES HAD WHIPPED THEIR BOW AGAINST MY MOTION
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A WIDESPREAD REBELLION SO IT'S THE CLEAR WILL OF THE ELECTED HOUSE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GET ON AND RESPECT ALL RIGHT HIS COFFEE IS SHE RIGHT IS MISSUS MAY RIGHT NOT TO GIVE THAT GUARANTEE WOULD THERESA MAY HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR SHE WANTS THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE NATIONALS IN THIS COUNTRY TO BE PROPERLY PROTECTED BUT HER FIRST PRIORITY HAS TO BE TO U.K. CITIZENS
AND THEIR RIGHTS WHICH ARE YET TO BE CLARIFIED I BELIEVE THAT SORTING THIS OUT AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BEST WAY OF ENSURING THAT PEOPLE ARE PROPERLY PROTECTED RIGHT SO IN THAT CASE WHY DOESN'T SHE SAY WE THIS COUNTRY UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WOULD GUARANTEE THE RIGHT OF THOSE WHO YOU CITIZENS WHO WERE AS ANDY BURNHAM SAYS HER
BRITISH CHILDREN PAY THEIR TAXES DO VALUABLE JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY WE WILL GUARANTEE THEIR RIGHTS NOW WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT BRITISH CITIZENS LIVING IN YOUR COUNTRIES WHY NOT DO THAT
THE DISCUSSIONS ON LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE DETAILS OF THAT HAVE NOT YET EVEN STARTED SO I THINK IT ALSO PRAY COS IT UP THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT YOU KNOW WE WERE BUT WE KIND OF SET THE TONE FOR THE DEBATE AS IT WERE I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOT OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER ELECTED YET ALTHOUGH OF COURSE I HOPE IT WILL BE THERESA MAY I THINK IS THE RIGHT APPROACH TO SAY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH EARLY ON BUT UNTIL WE ARE SURE ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF U.K. CITIZENS THERE IS NO POINT IN HAVING SPACE MAKING ONE PARTICULAR AGREEMENT
LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS E.U. NATIONALS WHO UNLAWFULLY RESIDENT FOR FIVE YEARS ARE ALL ALREADY AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN THE U.K. SO SOME PEOPLE AND PEAS NEED TO STOP SOME OF THE SCARE MONGERING AND ASHORE THOSE RESIDENTS THAT THAT WILL BE THE CASE BUT THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT TO LIVE BULLETS TO COMPLICATE ONE LEVEL OR A. SIMPLE ISSUE ON ANOTHER I WAS TALKING TO A DOCTOR THIS WEEK A G.P. WHO'S BEEN HERE FOR YEARS AND HE'S MARRIED TO A WELSH WOMAN HE'S GOT
KIDS HE IS ABOUT US ENGLISH APART FROM A SLIGHT ACCENT AS YOU WOULD FIND AND HE'S DESPERATELY WORRIED HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE WORRIED SURELY WELL INDEED AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THE MESSAGE NEEDS TO BE CONSENT AGAIN VERY CLEARLY E.U. NATIONALS WHO'VE BEEN HIT LAWFULLY RESIDENT HERE FOR FIVE YEARS ALREADY HAVE THE AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO LIVE IN THE U.K.
IF THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS FIRST PRIORITY HAS TO BE TO U.K. CITIZENS AND THEIR RIGHTS ARE NOT YET CLARIFIED SORTING OUT THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND PEOPLE IN OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES DOING THAT AT THE SAME TIME IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THE DEAL THAT IS WANTED ON BOTH SIDES I'M NOT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT I GO IN THERE NOT RIGHT WELL THANKS JOHN I THINK WILL WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT ARGUMENT
IN EFFECT IT'S PRIORITISE PEOPLE WHO'VE CHOSEN VOLUNTARILY TO MAKE THEIR LIFE ELSEWHERE AND LIVE IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY OVER AND ABOVE
PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING HERE THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT ARGUMENT AND JOE BY FAILING TO GIVE PEOPLE
SECURITY IT'S CONTINUING THE POTENTIALLY HOSTILE CLIMATE WHERE KIDS IN THE PLAYGROUND OF BEING TOLD THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO HOME IT'S JUST NOT IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT I THINK THIS WAS
A TEST OF LEADERSHIP FOR THERESA MAY IN THIS POST REFERENDUM SITUATION AND SHE'S FAILED IT SHE HASN'T GIVEN PEOPLE THE STABILITY THEY ARE LOOKING FOR AND POTENTIALLY IT'S CREATING AN UNWELCOMING CLIMATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IN MY VIEW THAT IS THE WRONG THING FOR ANY HOME SECRETARY TO DO
ALL RIGHT CONTRAST THE HOME SECRETARY HAS ABSOLUTELY CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS ON PEOPLE THIS IS THE WE ARE STILL PART OF THE E.U. PEOPLE CAN STILL COME TO THIS COUNTRY NOW BUT HER PRIORITY AS BRITISH PRIME MINISTER IS TO ENSURE THAT LEGAL STATUS IS PRESERVED AND THE BEST TIME TO SORT THAT OUT IS WHEN BOTH U.K. CITIZENS RIGHTS AND CITIZENS' RIGHTS I'LL DISCUSS TOGETHER VERY VERY QUICK QUESTION TO EACH OF YOU ABOUT YOUR POTENTIAL LEADERS ANDY BURNHAM LEADERSHIP RIVALS TO JEREMY ME WHAT SHOULD THEY BE DOING
WELL I'VE MADE MY POSITION ON THIS VERY CLEAR JOHN I HAVE SAID THAT THE PRIORITY THE LABOUR PARTY NOW SHOULDN'T BE TO DESCEND INTO CIVIL WAR IT SHOULD BE TO TRY AND GIVE THE COUNTRY
CLARITY INSTABILITY ANOTHER WOULD STICK WITH JEREMY AND GET AFTER THIS GOVERNMENT COS IT'S CAUSING CHAOS FOR FAMILIES AS I'VE JUST BEEN SAYING ALL RIGHT THERESE COFFEE YOU'VE SEEN THE HEADLINE OF THE MALE YOU KNOW ABOUT THE LEAD SOME STORY THE STORY SAYING THAT ACCORDING TO THE TIMES HEADLINE BEING A MOTHER GIVES YOU THE EDGE OVER THERESA MAY
DOESN'T HE GIVES HER THE EDGE OVER TREES MAY BECAUSE THERESA MAY DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN AND SHE DOES WHAT D'YOU MAKE OF THAT WELL AND HE'S A FRIEND I KNOW SHE'S NOT A MALICIOUS PERSON IT SEEMS SHE SUGGESTING THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE MEANT TO SAY WELL I'D SAY THE TRANSCRIPT DON'T I'VE GOT THE THING AND THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID THE WOOD EDGE BUT SHE MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT THAT
JOHN WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE IS PUT ACROSS IS THAT I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS WHETHER SOMEBODY HAS CHILDREN NOT THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO FOR EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY I BELIEVE TREASA MAY HAVE GOT THE PROVEN LEADERSHIP SHE'S GOT THE QUALITIES SHE COULD BE PRIME MINSTER TOMORROW AND I HOPE PEOPLE READ THE TELEGRAPH INTERVIEW NOT JUST THE TIMES HEADLINE RIGHT WELL AS IT'S A TANGIBLE STAKES SHE BEING AMBER MEANS YOU HAVE A VERY REAL STAKE IN THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAYS WELL AS TO SAY ANDREA I'VE MET HER CHILDREN THE VERY PLEASANT CHILDREN BUT WHAT MATTERS FOR THE PRIME MINISTER IS NOT JUST THEIR OWN CHILDREN BUT EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY O.K.

POLICE IN DALLAS SAY THEY HAVE FOUND A BOMB MAKING COMPONENTS AT THE HOME OF THE GUNMAN WHO KILLED FIVE POLICE OFFICERS AND B.B.C. NEWS UNDERSTANDS THAT A LABOUR REVIEW OF THE PARTY'S DEFENCE POLICY WILL KEEP OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF BRITAIN RETAINING A NUCLEAR WEAPONS SYSTEM TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS ABSENCE THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CANDIDATE ANDREA LETTERMAN'S BEEN ACCUSED OF MAKING THE CONTEST PERSONAL BY SUGGESTING THAT HAVING CHILDREN MAKES A BETTER CHOICE TO BE PRIME MINISTER
THE ALLEGATION IS MADE BY THE TIMES NEWSPAPER WHICH QUOTES THE ENERGY MINISTER SAYING THE FACT THAT SHE'S A MOTHER MEANS SHE HAS A VERY REAL STAKE IN BRITAIN'S FUTURE THIS IS LETTERMAN'S RIVAL THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY HAS NO CHILDREN THIS IS LEAD SOME HAS SAID THE ARTICLE MISS REPRESENTS HER COMMENTS BUT THE TIMES HAS NOW RELEASED A RECORDING OF THE INTERVIEW IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ELEANOR GUNNY
ANDREA LEADS AND A MOTHER OF THREE SAID THERESA MAY WOULD BE REALLY SAD SHE DIDN'T HAVE CHILDREN AND SO IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE FOR A POINT TO BE MADE OF THE ISSUE BUT IN AN AUDIO EXTRACT OF THE INTERVIEW RELEASED BY THE TIMES MISSUS LED SOME CAN BE HEARD SUGGESTING HAVING CHILDREN MADE HER A BETTER CHOICE TO BE PRIME MINISTER
MAMA NEEDS VERY WHEELS THEY EACH HAVE A COUNTRY EIGHT PENGELLY DE THANK YOU POSSIBLY HELP ME O.K. BUT I HAVE CHILDREN
MISSUS LEADS AND HAS CALLED THE ARTICLE GUTTER JOURNALISM AND DESPICABLE AND HATEFUL REPORTING COMMENTS IN THE TIME'S COME JUST DAYS AFTER THE HOME SECRETARY SPOKE ABOUT HOW SHE AND HER HUSBAND PHILIP WERE AFFECTED BY BEING UNABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN HER CAMPAIGN TEAM MADE NO OFFICIAL COMMENT BUT HER SOUL SAID THEY PERSONALLY FOUND THE ARTICLE SAD AND OFFENSIVE
POLICE IN DALLAS SAY THEY FOUND BOMB MAKING MATERIAL AND A CACHE OF WEAPONS AT THE HOME OF THE MAN WHO SHOT DEAD FIVE POLICE IN THE CITY MICHAEL JOHNSON AN ARMY VETERAN OPEN FIRE DURING A STREET PROTEST AGAINST THE KILLING OF BLACK MEN BY WHITE POLICE OFFICERS SEVEN PEOPLE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK POLICE EVENTUALLY KILL JOHNSON USING A BOMB CARRIED BY A REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE A CORRESPONDENT JAMES COOKE REPORTS FROM DALLAS

ON THURSDAY NIGHT JOHNSON HE WAS BLACK TURNED ON HIS FELLOW AMERICANS USING A RIFLE TO AMBUSH AND MARTA WHITE POLICE OFFICER
POLICE SAY HE TOLD NEGOTIATORS HE WAS RETALIATING FOR THE KILLINGS OF TWO BLACK MEN SHOT BY POLICE IN LOUISIANA AND MINNESOTA EARLIER THIS WEEK
INVESTIGATORS HAD REVEALED THAT JOHNSON HAD AMASSED AN ARSENAL AT A SUBURBAN HOME IN TEXAS INCLUDING BOMB MAKING MATERIALS BULLETPROOF VESTS RIFLES AND AMMUNITION
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TO CUT SHORT HIS TRIP TO EUROPE TO VISIT DALLAS EARLY NEXT WEEK AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE APPEALED FOR CALM AS PROTESTS BOTH FOR AND AGAINST THE POLICE CONTINUE IN A NATION ON THE EDGE
IT'S EMERGED THAT AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF LABOUR'S DEFENCE POLICY WILL KEEP OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF BRITAIN RETAINING A NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM B.B.C. NEWS UNDERSTANDS THE JEREMY CORBIN HAS ACCEPTED THE DRAFT CONCLUSIONS DESPITE HAVING CAMPAIGN FOR DISARMAMENT THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER MORE DETAILS FROM NEWSNIGHT'S POLITICAL EDITOR NICHOLAS WHAT
JEREMY CORBIN WILL THIS YEAR CELEBRATE THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS MEMBERSHIP OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT BUT NEWSNIGHT HAS LEARNT THAT THE LABOUR LEADER HAS ACCEPTED THE DRAFT FINDINGS OF AN INTERNAL REVIEW WHICH COULD SEE A FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT EXCEPT A NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME IN DIMINISHED FORM
THE REVIEW HAS AT ITS HEART FIVE TESTS INCLUDING AN ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER THE DETERRENT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEFENCE OF THE U.K. AND WILL BE VALUE FOR MONEY
IT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT LABOUR IS OPPOSED TO A LIKE FOR LIKE REPLACEMENT OF THE CURRENT TRIDENT SYSTEM BUT LABOUR COULD EXCEPT A MORE MODEST WEAPONS PROGRAMME WITH FEWER SUBMARINES AND FEWER WARHEADS
NEWSNIGHT UNDERSTANDS THAT JEREMY CORBIN BELIEVES THE REVIEW COULD PROVIDE A MIDDLE WAY BETWEEN MAINTAINING A FULL SCALE NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME AND IMMEDIATE DISARMAMENT THIS WOULD ALLOW THE U.K. TO TAKE A MORE GRADUAL APPROACH TOWARDS ABANDONING ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS
JEREMY CORBIN IS DUE TO ADDRESS ONE OF EUROPE'S LARGEST TRADES UNION GATHERINGS THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SECOND DURHAM MINERS' GALA TODAY A NUMBER OF LABOUR M.P.S WHO VOTED AGAINST MY COPING IN THE RECENT CONFIDENCE VOTE HAVE HAD THEIR PLATFORM PASSES RESCINDED ALL THAT THEY'D NOT BEEN BANNED FROM THE EVENT OR THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND

IT WAS KNOWN THAT OTHER NATO MEMBERS WERE REVIEWING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO A BRITISH OFFICIAL SPEAKING AHEAD OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS SAID THAT THE EXPANDED FIVE HUNDRED STRONG BRITISH FORCE WOULD STAY IN AFGHANISTAN INTO TWENTY SEVENTEEN HE SAID THAT BRITAIN WOULD ALSO CONTINUE TO GIVE SOME SEVENTY MILLION POUNDS A YEAR TO HELP THE AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION POUNDS WOULD GO TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT NEXT YEAR
THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT SAYS TEN THOUSAND POLICE AND SOLDIERS HAVE NOW BEEN DEPLOYED TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER WITH SERBIA TO PREVENT ANY ILLEGAL MIGRANTS GETTING THROUGH AROUND ONE THOUSAND MIGRANTS ARE WEAKER STILL REACHING AUSTRIA THROUGH SERBIA AND HUNGARY NICK THORPE SENT THIS REPORT FROM THE BORDER BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES THERE ARE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THIS MAKESHIFT CAMP OF TENTS AND LEAN TWO'S THROWING TOGETHER ALONG THE SERBIAN SIDE OF HUNGARY'S BORDER FENCE
THEIR NAMES ARE ON THE LIST TO BE LET INTO THE TRANSIT ZONE WHICH IS ACTUALLY BUILT INTO THE FENCE BUT THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES ARE ONLY LETTING IN FIFTEEN PEOPLE A DAY HERE
UP TO TWO HUNDRED A DAY USED TO CROSS ILLEGALLY OVER THE FENCE BUT A MASSIVE HUNGARIAN POLICE AND ARMY PRESENT ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE BORDER MEANS THAT EVEN THOSE WHO DO GET ACROSS GET CAUGHT AND SINCE THE FIFTH OF JULY THEY'VE BEEN PUSHED BACK INTO SERBIA
WHILE BULGARIA SERBIA AND MACEDONIA TOLERATE SMALL NUMBERS OF PEOPLE GETTING THROUGH ILLEGALLY THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL STOP EVERYBODY THAT TURNING THIS SANDY FIELD INTO THE LATEST BOTTLENECK ON THE WEST BALKAN ROUTE
THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH SAYS THAT CUSTOMERS IT'S OF A HIGH STREET BANKS WHO BREACHED OVERDRAFT LIMITS CAN FACE CHARGES WHICH ARE AROUND FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN A PAYDAY LOAN WHICH SAYS THERE SHOULD BE NO EXTRA CHARGE FOR EXCEEDING THE LIMIT IS A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JO LINE
LAST YEAR THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY PUT A KAPPA ZERO POINT EIGHT PERCENT AND HOW MUCH PAYDAY LENDERS COULD CHARGE THEIR CUSTOMERS PER DAY BUT RESEARCH FROM WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SOME MAINSTREAM LENDERS ARE CHARGING CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THAT CAP IF SOMEONE EXCEEDS THEIR AGREED OVERDRAFT LIMIT BY ONE HUNDRED POUNDS IN A MONTH BANKS SUCH AS A BS AND LLOYD'S APPLY A CHARGE OF UP TO NINETY
THE CONSUMER GROUP SAYS THAT FIGURE COULD BE EVEN HIGHER IF INTEREST IS APPLIED OR IF THE BORROWING SPANS TWO SEPARATE CHARGING PERIODS ARE B'S WHICH APPLIES THE HIGHEST FEES ACCORDING TO WHICH SAID ON APPROVED OVERDRAFTS WERE AN EXPENSIVE METHOD OF BORROWING AND URGED CUSTOMERS TO USE ITS ACT NOW ALERT SERVICE TO REDUCE BORROWING COSTS
A B.B.C.

IT'S COMING UP TO TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THERE ARE DEMONSTRATIONS IN CITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AT THE MOMENT CONTINUING THE PROTESTS ABOUT THE SHOOTING DEAD OF TWO BLACK PEN BY POLICE THEY'VE ALSO BEEN MORE ATTACKS ON POLICE BUT NONE SO SERIOUS AS WHAT HAPPENED IN DALLAS ON THURSDAY NIGHT MICHAEL JOHNSON A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD FORMER SOLDIER WHO HAD SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN WENT ON A RAMPAGE KILLING FIVE POLICEMEN AND INJURING A NUMBER OF OTHERS A REPORTER LAURA BAKER HAS BEEN GAUGING THE MOOD IN THE CITY
THAT WOULD UNITE US BIG WORRY ABOUT THEM BACK WHICH DIVIDES UP THE SHOCK IN DALLAS HAS GIVEN WAY TO GREEN
AT A VIGIL TO REMEMBER THE FALLEN OFFICERS THEY PRAY
BUT THE VIOLENT EVENTS OF THE LAST WEEK IN AMERICA HAS TORN OPEN A FESTERING WOUND THAT NEVER REALLY HEALED
POLICE CHIEF DAVID BROWN PLEADED FOR UNITY AS HE MOURNED THE LOSS OF HIS OFFICERS OFFICERS WHAT TO
THERE WERE FIVE
WE NEED THIS COMMUNE WITH ME CITIZENS TO SHOW
BUT THEY APPRECIATE THEIR SACRIFICE
EVENTS IN DALLAS ON THURSDAY NIGHT APPEAR TO BE A LONE ACT OF TWISTED RETALIATION AFTER SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WHICH HAVE EXPOSED PAINFUL QUESTIONS OVER POLICING INJURY
MICHAEL JOHNSON AN ARMY VETERAN WHO DID A TOUR OF AFGHANISTAN SAID HE WANTED TO KILL WHITE POLICE OFFICERS HE SAID HE WAS ANGRY AT THE LATEST SHOOTINGS OF BLACK MEN BY OFFICERS IN MINNESOTA AND LOUISIANA JAZZ L.P.
PROTESTS OVER THE EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE BY POLICE HAVE SPRUNG UP ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HAVE CONTINUED DESPITE THE EVENTS IN DALLAS
COLLECT FLANNIGAN IS FOUNDER OF MOTHERS AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY HER SON CLINTON WAS KILLED BY POLICE IN DALLAS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SHE HAS SYMPATHY WITH THE FORCE AND A LOSS BUT SHE HAS THIS STARTLING ADVICE FOR YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA HE GETS THAT BY POLICEMEN START RECORDING ON YOU PROBABLY NEED
LET SOMEBODY KNOW YOU'VE BEEN STYLE BECAUSE THIS IS THE WORLD THAT WE WIN
AMERICA IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN IS STEERING ACROSS A DEEP RACIAL DIVIDE IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE BUT NOW IT IS CAPTURED ON CAMERA SHEARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA VEER FOR ALL TO SEE
SO HOW CAN THAT GAP BE BRIDGED THE REVEREND MICHAEL WATERS IS A LOCAL PASTOR YOUR ARMS
THE SLICK THE GREAT PRIDE IN RESPECT OF THE BARE PATCH THROUGH THEIR COMMUNITY
BUILDING COMMUNITY SECTORS
I REALLY BELIEVED FUNDAMENTALLY THERE WE NEED IT FOR YOUR TROUBLE
BROUGHT TOGETHER PAUL THEY'RE ACTIVELY TO BUILD UP
AS A STEADY STREAM OF PEOPLE LAY FLOWERS OUTSIDE THE DALLAS POLICE HEADQUARTERS IT APPEARS THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS UNITED IN ONE WAY IN GRIEF AND PAIN
IN THIS MULTI RACIAL CITY THE MIA AND BLACK POLICE CHIEF ARE BOTH CALLING FOR HER DIVISIVENESS TO STOP THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION SEEMS QUEER
THE WAY AHEAD DOES NOT LAURA BAKER REPORTING GREGORY THOMAS IS PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ORGANISATION OF BLACK LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EXECUTIVES AND I ASKED FOR HIS THOUGHTS ON WHAT WAS HAPPENING ACROSS THE UNITED STATES
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A SERIES OF EVENTS ARE YOUR COMPLEX AND MADE SURE IT WAS HARD TO UNPACK WORE THEM RIGHT BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE MANY OF THE MAORI IN REACTION TO EVENTS THAT ARE PERCEIVED TO BE
IN THE AREA OFFICIAL POLICEMAN'S KINDA WOULD OPEN STERLING OFF THEIR LAND LOCUST ELAN
WOULD THEY BE ALIVE IF THEY WERE WHITE BUT A DESPICABLE DEVONNE AND I'VE GOT TO GO ON THAT SPACE I KNOW OTHERS HAVE SPECULATED LIKE THAT I JUST DON'T NOT THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH OF A OF A VARIABLE THAT I CAN I SPEAK TO END WILL NOT SPEAK TO HER BUT I COULD SAY WHAT DO YOU AND OTHER POLICE RACIST IN THE IN THE STATES BUT WHAT I FIND IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF REFERENCE TO INDIVIDUAL VENTS DEBT PAIN A PICTURE OF RACIST POLICING ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW IT'S UNFAIR
FOR ANY ONE ENTITY ONE EDNA C.B. PAINTED A WRONGLY IT ON BEHALF OF OTHER INCIDENTS THAT OTHERS HAVE OCCURRED OR OTHERS HAVE IN GAZING AT THIS OR SIMILARLY IT'S NOT RIGHT TO PAIN
ONE POLICE THE POLLEN OR POLICING AS PROFESSIONAL GREATEST BECAUSE OF ONE OR TWO INCIDENTS FOR MAYBE MORE THAN ACTING AS CASE BUT HOLD ON A SECOND THERE ARE PLENTY OF INCIDENTS I'M I'M FIND IT SURPRISING THAT YOU'RE NOT A PARTICULARLY IN A WAY GIVEN THE ROLE THAT YOU HAVE AS PART OF THE NATIONAL ORGANISATION OF BLACK LAW ENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVE
YOU'RE NOT POINT FLAGGING THIS UP AS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM OF RACES I DIDN'T SAY THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM RACISM IN POLICING GOES THERE IS BECAUSE LIKE EVERY OTHER ENTITY WILL BE IN GOVERNMENT OR CORPORATE SECTOR
THE PEOPLE YOU HIRE COME FROM NO THE SOCIETY AT LARGE WHICH IS STILL FILLED WITH RACISM AS A CHALLENGE TO GET OVER AS A SOCIETY THAT BEING SAID BY THE FORT
POLICING WILL HAVE RACISM ISSUE NOW YOU ASK ME OR POLICE GREATEST I'M NOT GOING TO GO THERE I'M NOT GOING TO ATTACH THAT TO EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT EVERY POLICE OFFICER IN THE COUNTRY IT'S NOT FEAR IT'S NOT TRUE WHAT I ACTUALLY OURS WASN'T ARE ALL POLICE RACIST BUT ARE THE POLICE RACIST AND IN A WAY IT'S WHETHER THERE'S AN INSTITUTIONAL BUYER
THERE ARE POLICE OFFICERS SINGLE ARE ACTORS IN POLICE DEPARTMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY
WHO ARE ACTING OUTSIDE OF THE PER SCRIPTED AND EXPECTED NORMS OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THE TRAIN DIFFERENTLY THEY ARE TRAINED TO BE BETTER TO KNOW BETTER AND TO DO BETTER
SINGER WERE ACTORS ARE OUR CARRY NO WEIGHT FOR THE ENTIRE POLICE INDUSTRY IS JUST THE BOTTOM LINE SO IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING RUN ACCOUNTS NOW SINCE HE WAS A KNIGHT I WILL NOT ALLOW TO BE WON IT'S INDICATIVE OF ALL POLICE AND UNITED STATES ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY NOW I'M CONCERNED AND WORRIED I'M TROUBLE ALL THE WORLD YOU THINK OF ADJECTIVES
RELATE TO THE THE FILM WE HAVE RIGHT NOW I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE IT'S A PROCESS THAT HASN'T HEALED YET ROME IT'S A WORN AMUSED TO BE IDENTIFIED A AND THEN HEELED B. AND SOMETIMES YOU PUT A BENDING OVER
MUTYA TARIQ IT TO CLOSE IT AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL THE TIME WITH HIM YOU'D BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT IT'S ONGOING PROCESS THAT WILL BE SOLVED OVERNIGHT BUT WILL BE SOLVED HELL HE'LL BE SOLVED WE CAN SORT IT LEADERSHIP
THAT COMES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE DISCUSSION SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S TIME NOW FOR POLICE LEADERS TO STEP TO THE PLATE AND RECOGNISED THAT HERE IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY
THAT THERE ARE SOME MEMORIES IN YOUR DEPARTMENT THAT HAVE RACIST VIEWS ON THE OTHER SIDE SIMILARLY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE ARE CARRYING WEIGHT THAT IT'S BEEN HERE FOR YEARS AND ARE ACTING OUT IN MATTERS THAT ARE DISRESPECTFUL TBILISI SO WE HAVE WORK TO DO ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION
GREGORY THOMAS TALKING TO ME EARLIER THE TIME IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT IN THE BAN ON WOMEN SOLDIERS SERVING IN THE FRONT LINE IS ABOUT TO BE LIFTED THAT'S WHAT DOWNING STREET HAS ANNOUNCED AND THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF OPPOSITION TO IT AND SOME SUPPORT AS WELL GENERALS WHO NICK CARTER HE CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF HEAD OF THE ARMY AND I CAN ASSUME GENERAL THAT YOU ARE A SUPPORTER NO ABSOLUTELY JOHN INDEED I RECOMMENDED THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS WHY
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNISE THAT THE CHARACTER OF CONFLICT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED WE NEED ALL OF THE TALENT THAT WE CAN ACQUIRE IN OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THAT AS AN ARMY WE'VE EMPLOYED WOMEN VERY SUCCESSFULLY AND ALL SORTS OF ROLES FROM NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND I THINK IT SENSIBLE WE MAKE THE NEXT EVOLUTION IN THIS PROCESS BUT FRONTLINE HAND TO HAND COMBAT
I THINK IF YOU WERE COMMANDING A BATTALION IN THE FOOTPRINTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO YOU WOULD HAVE OBVIOUSLY A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TO THE ONE WE HAVE NOW THE PLAIN FACT IS THAT THAT BATTALION COMMANDER WOULD HAVE MORE THAN LIKELY HE'S MINEFIELD BEEN CLEARED FOR HIM BY WOMEN
THE MINEFIELD LANE THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH WOULD BE MANNED BY WOMEN THE E.O.D. OPERATOR SITTING TO CLEAR THE THE EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT CLEAR THOSE
IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WOULD BE PROBABLY BE WOMEN NOW AND A LOT OF THE FAT CONTROLLER'S WILL BE WOMEN RIGHT THE ANSWER IS THAT ON THIS MODERN BATTLEFIELD WOMEN ARE INDISPENSIBLE PART OF OUR OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS RIGHT SO WE WOULDN'T SEE WOMEN IN TRENCHES COME CHARGING LEAPING OUT OF THE TRENCHES AND CHARGING TOWARDS THE ENEMY IN THE WAY THAT WE KNOW OF OLD NO I'VE BEEN DESCRIBING WHAT YOU SEE TODAY THE ANSWER IS THAT IN THE FUTURE COME TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU WOULD
SEE SOME WOMEN IN THE COMBAT ROLE DOING WHAT YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED YOU WOULD
YES BUT THE POINT IS OFTEN MADE THAT YOU DON'T SEE SAY ANDY MURRAY PLAYING VENUS WILLIAMS ON THE TENNIS COURT YOU SEE PLAYING IN PLAYING IN THE FINAL BECAUSE
HE'S STRONGER AND BETTER AT RESEARCH WOULD SEPARATE DOESN'T THE SAME APPLIED TO TWO WOMEN WHETHER THEIR SOLDIERS OR TENNIS PLAYERS OR WHATEVER I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU SET THE STANDARDS AND YOU DON'T COMPROMISE COMPROMISE THEIR STANDARDS AND ON THAT BASIS I THINK THE GENERATION WHEN OUR COMMANDING ENTIRELY UNDERSTANDS THAT SMALL TEAMS CAN OPERATE
WITH A VARIETY AND DIVERSITY OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITHIN THEM PROVIDED THEY ARE ALL ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE APPROPRIATE STANDARDS AND YOU SAY THE APPROPRIATE STANDARDS WILL THERE BE A DIFFERENT SET OF FITNESS STANDARD SPECIFICALLY FITNESS AND STRENGTH ARE STANDARDS REGARDLESS OF GENDER OR WILL THAT WILL THEY BE THE SAME SET
THE SAME TEST FOR MEN AS THERE IS FOR WOMEN EXACTLY THE SAME IN EVERY RESPECT YES THERE WILL BE EXACTLY THE SAME STANDARD SET AND THEREFORE THE SAME TEST TO ASSESS THAT STANDARD WILL THERE BE ANY PRESSURE TO LOWER THEIR STANDARDS THEIR PHYSICAL STANDARDS WERE TALKING ABOUT OBVIOUSLY OTHER THINGS BUT PURELY THE PHYSICAL STANDARD BECAUSE I MEAN MEN ARE STRONGER BY AND LARGE THE WOMEN THAT'S A FACT ISN'T IT YES IT IS BUT I THINK TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD ABOUT THIS JOHN WE SHOULDN'T BE EXCLUDING THOSE WOMEN WHO ARE ABLE OF MEETING THOSE STANDARDS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE HER LOTS LIKE MEN
BUT YOU COULD EQUALLY BE SAYING COULDN'T YOU THERE ARE THINGS THAT WOMEN DO BETTER THAN MEN THEREFORE THOSE OF JOBS THEY SHOULD BE DOING THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT MEN DO BETTER THAN WOMEN THEREFORE THOSE THE JOBS THEY SHOULD BE DOING THAT THAT ISN'T DISCRIMINATION IS IT THAT SIMPLY PLAYING A SET OF STANDARDS WHERE THEY WILL PROVE MOST EFFECTIVE
YES BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO GENERALISE THESE DAYS I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO GIVE TALL EVER NAIL AT THAT I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IF THEY'RE CAPABLE OF DOING IT IS THERE MUCH SUPPORT SUPPORTED AS YOU SAY YOU USE WOOD YOURSELF AND IN THE MILITARY THAT THAT IS IT WE HAVE THE POLITICAL SUPPORT AS WELL BUT DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE MANY WOMEN SCOOBY MANY WOMEN SIGNING UP FOR FRONTLINE COMBAT
THE ANSWER IS THAT I I DON'T KNOW BUT I DRESSED ANNUAL ARMY SERVICE WOMEN'S NETWORK ABOUT THE OTHER DAY AND THERE PROBABLY FIVE HUNDRED WOMEN IN THE ROOM AND I ASKED IF ANY OF THEM WOULD LIKE TO TRANSFER TO THE ROYAL ARMOUR MACAW OR TO THE INFANTRY ARE FEW
SAID THEY'D LIKE TO TRANSFER TO THE ROYAL ARMOUR COURT SHE KNOWS HER MOUNTED ROLE AND IS LESS PHYSICALLY DEMANDING BUT THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE ROOM WHO WANTED TO TRANSFER TO THE INFANTRY NOBODY
NONE NONE OF THE ONES WHO ARE CURRENTLY SERVING THAT'S NOT TO SAY OBVIOUSLY THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO PERHAPS WOULD LIKE TO JOIN ME TO JOIN THE EFFORT YOU PUT IN THERE WERE THOSE WHO WERE STILL SERVING THAT WAS A STRAW POLL THERE WEREN'T MANY WHO WANTED TO DO IT RIGHT SO IT'S POSSIBLE THEY'LL BE A BIT OF FUSS ABOUT THIS OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A BIT OF US GOING ON ABOUT THIS AS WE SPEAK BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IN TWO YEARS FIVE YEARS FROM NOW THINGS WON'T LOOK ALL THAT DIFFERENT
IF I DO I THINK THAT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE BUT I GO BACK TO MIKE SORT OF POINT OF PRINCIPLE I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE DENYING ANYBODY THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE WHAT THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE RIGHT CAN I ASK YOU A MORE GENERAL QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU HEARD TO MAX HASTINGS ON THE PROGRAMME EARLIER COMMENTING ON CHILCOTT AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WHAT
CHILCOTT SAID IN BROAD DETAILS EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE THE EVERY SINGLE DOT COMMA OF IT HE SAID ESSENTIALLY THAT THE CHIEFS OF STAFF WERE VALUES MAX'S WORDS GAGGING FOR FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO GET INVOLVED THAT'S WHAT THE ARMED FORCES DO THEY WANTED TO FIGHT A LOT GOING ON ALL THAT IS HE RIGHT ABOUT THAT AND IF HE IS RIGHT HAS THAT CHANGED
THERE'S A POINT I THINK YOU'D EXPECT TO MAKE FIRST OF ALL IS THAT I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO EAT THE WHOLE REPORT NO YOU DO I WASN'T A CHIEF OF STAFF AT THE TIME BUT I DO YOU THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT LESSON TO LEARN FROM
AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY AS POLICY MAKERS AND SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS TO LEAN INTO EACH OTHER TO UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE MILITARY INSTRUMENT AND POLITICIANS IF THEY'VE GOT IT WRONG IF THEY'RE ASKING TOO MUCH
I THINK WE COLLECTIVELY AS A BODY DO THAT WE NEED TO TALK TO EACH OTHER SO THAT WE COLLECTIVELY UNDERSTAND BOTH AS POLICY MAKERS ARE MILITARY OFFICERS THE WRISTS AND THE POSSIBILITIES
I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNISE THAT WE NOW OPERATE IN A GOLDFISH BOWL IN TERMS OF INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S NOT EASY FOR POLICY MAKERS OR MILITARY OFFICERS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE REALLY CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS AS WE PURSUE THE CHALLENGES OF THE DAY SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BETTER AND THEREFORE MAKE BETTER QUALITY DECISIONS MAYBE YOU'RE A BIT LESS GUN THE WHOLE NOW THAN YOU WERE BACK THERE IS THAT POSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MINDSET
I MEAN I THINK I THINK WHAT WE'VE LEARNT BIG LESSONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIKELY CONTEXT ON THE GROUND AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID THROUGH THE REFORM OF THE ARMY THREE YEARS AGO WAS TO PROMOTE THE IDEA OF BEING PERSISTENTLY ENGAGED IF YOU LIKE A HEAD OF THE BANG OVERSEAS SO WE DEVELOPED THAT INSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING AND THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SHAPE
CONDITIONS IN A DIFFERENT WAY SO THAT IN THE EVENT OF SOMETHING HAPPENING TO HAPPEN WE'VE GOT A BETTER CHANCE OF HAVING THE CULTURAL EXPERTISE THE PRE DEVELOPED RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIGENOUS FORCES POLITICIANS AND JUST A PLACE FORGIVE ME JUST JUST IN A CENTRE TO IF YOU WOULD NO MORE SNATCH LAND ROVERS ON THE FRONT LINE
WELL WE ARE VERY WELL EQUIPPED NOW JOHN AND I BUT FOR CERTAIN THINGS WITH OUT YOU'D EXPECT THE HEAD OF THE ARM IT'S ALWAYS LIKE HE WANTS OTHER EQUIPMENT FOR OTHER THINGS BUT IN TERMS OF THE NATURE OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN REPRESENTED WE HAVE FIRST RATE EQUIPPED GENERAL CARTER MANY THANKS
IT'S NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST EIGHT THERE WAS A HUGE ONLINE RESPONSE THIS WEEK TO AN ARTICLE IN THE TELEGRAPH BY YOUNG BRITISH WOMAN LOUISE LINTON WAS PLUGGING A BOOK ABOUT HER GAP YEAR IN ZAMBIA BUT SHE'S BEEN HEAPED WITH RIDICULE FOR USING TIRED AFRICAN STEREOTYPES AND HAVING A WHITE SAVIOUR COMPLEX SHE SINCE CLOSED HER TWITTER ACCOUNT
LYDIA AND GOMA IS A ZIP ZAMBIAN WRITER WHO STARTED THE LINTON LIVES HASHTAG GREG GREG BOZ IS THE FOUNDER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR OF AFRICAN IMPACT A COMPANY THAT ORGANISES GAP YEAR PROJECTS YOU BOTH
GOOD MORNING MORNING LYDIAN GUN WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT THAT YOU READ THAT SO IRRITATED
THE STEREOTYPES REALLY AND THE FACT THAT SHE DID NOT GET HER FACTS STRAIGHT IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE THING THAT SHE WRITES ABOUT ZAMBIA BECAUSE SHE TALKS ABOUT MONSOONS ANACONDAS GIANT SPIDERS AND
THE CITY OF KIT WHICH IS THE COUNTRY'S MINING CAPITAL IN THE YEAR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE STILL RUNNING ON WITH GOATS AND YOUR CARDS IT WAS IT WAS SURPRISING I'VE GOT THE BOOK WHICH IS
I THINK IT'S IT'S THAT TERRIBLE INVESTMENT ON MY PART BUT THEN I'VE GOT THE BOOK AND I READ IT AND I'M READING IT RIGHT NOW AND THEY STILL CAN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT IS
REMOTELY TRUE ABOUT ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK REGARDING THE PIECE THE PEOPLE OF THEIR CULTURE
IF WHAT IF IT'S JUST IT'S A BIT SAD REALLY THAT PEOPLE TODAY CAN STILL READ SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND HE PUT AND YOUR PARTICULAR CRITICISM AND THE REASON THAT LINTON LIES YOU'RE THE HASHTAG YOU SET UP HAS TOOK TOOK OFF WAS BECAUSE IT PLAYS INTO STEREOTYPES IT DOES IT REALLY DOES BECAUSE WE HAVE
CHILDREN WITH H.I.V. ACTUALLY ONE OF THE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK'S SESSIONS THAT ALL THE CHILDREN IN THIS VILLAGE ARE DYING WITH YOU TOBY THEY WANT TO MAKE IT THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT EH TELL YOU ABOUT THEM THEY STILL CAN'T STOP BEING PROMISCUOUS IF I CAN USE THAT WORD
AND HE ALSO TALKS ABOUT AFRICA LEG SHE MEASURES AND THERE'S A SCENE WHERE SHE BRINGS HER C.D. PLAYER AND PEOPLE ARE CLAPPING AND THEY'RE DANCING LIKE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A RADIO BEFORE AND CAN I JUST READ YOUR LINE
LOOK I HAVE BETRAYED NOW YES AND THIS IS A SCENE IN WHICH A SNAKE A SKILLED AND THE PEAT AND THEN SHE SHE SEES PEOPLE WENT AS AIDS DONALD AS NICK AND EVERYTHING AND SHE SAYS
THEY WERE ACTING LIKE SAVAGES AND HE FRIGHTENED ME THEY FRIGHTENED ME
REALLY WHY WOULD YOU CALL PEOPLE SAVAGES THEY HOWL
LET ME BRING IN GREG BOWS HERE BECAUSE YOU RUN THIS COMPANY THAT SENDS WESTERN VOLUNTEERS TO WORK ON PROJECTS IN AFRICA AND DO YOU THINK THERE'S AN EXPECTATION FROM THE PEOPLE PAY YOU TO GO OUT THERE WHAT ARE THEY GOING OUT THERE FOR DO THEY DO YOU THINK OFTEN THERE IS A SORT OF WHITE SAVIOUR MENTALITY AMONG THOSE WHO WHO WERE
TAKING UP TRIPS ON ON ORGANISATION WITH ORGANISATIONS LIKE YOURS HIGH YES AND I THINK THERE CAN BE A LOT OF ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO GO ALL OVER THE WORLD TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND TRY AND HELP I DON'T THINK
PEOPLE ALWAYS KNOW AS HOW TO HELP AND I THINK ORGANISATIONS LIKE OURS IF RUN IN THE CORRECT WAY CAN PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO TO TO LEARN AND TO MAKE CHANNEL THAT ENTHUSIASM INTO DOING SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE AND PLAY BUT I MEAN THEY MAY BE GOING WITH THE GOOD INTENTIONS BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT THAT THEY'RE MAKING THE INDIVIDUAL FEEL GOOD ISN'T IT DO YOU THINK SOME ORGANISATIONS PLAY ON THAT
YES I DO I THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT A PIECE AND IT'S A MASSIVE VARIETY AND INDIFFERENT ORGANISATIONS OFFER VOLUNTEERING LIKE MOST INDUSTRIES HAS A HUGE VARIANCE AND QUALITY OF WHAT PEOPLE DO AND I ALSO AGREE THAT IT'S NOT A PURELY SELFLESS PEOPLE WANT TO GO THEY WANT TO TRAVEL THEY WANT TO THEY WANTED TO TO DO GOOD THEY ALSO WANT TO FEEL GOOD AND I THINK THE ORGANISATIONS THAT DO VOLUNTEERING AND PROVIDE
PLATFORMS FOR PEOPLE TO VOLUNTEER IN THE BEST WAY CAN CATERS FOR ALL THOSE AND CAN DO SOME REALLY AMAZING WORKING GENERATE GREAT IMPACTS AND GUM I SUPPOSE WITH THE INTERNET NOW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY AND THIS CERTAINLY ILLUSTRATES IT TO CHALLENGE ANY NARRATIVE THAT SOMEBODY'S PRODUCER
YES REALLY I DO AGREE WITH GREG IN THE FACT THAT WE DO NEED VOLUNTEERS YEAH WE COULD USE ALL THE HELP WE COULD GET A BED
IT'S THEIR ATTITUDE THEIR PEOPLE THE PEOPLE COME WITH HIS LEAD KILLING THREE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE YOU MAKE YOUR YOU LOOK GOOD YOU GET A TOUR AND YOU BUTCHER IGOR BY THEN WITH THE INTERNET RIGHT NOW YOU CAN GET SO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THE COUNTRY OR TRYING TO VISIT SO THAT YOU DON'T COME WITH I WILL USE THE WORD COLONIAL VIEW OF THIS PLACE
THINGS HAVE CHANGED PEOPLE ARE CHANGING AND NO TWO PLACES ARE DIFFERENT BUT YOU ARE SO MUCH DIVERSITY IN THAT WE CANNOT GENERALISE AFRICA AS ONE BIG COUNTRY AND OF COURSE ONLINE YOU CAN PUSH BACK WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE PRODUCES A NARRATIVE LYDIAN GRAMA GREG THOSE THANK YOU

MISSUS MAY DOES NOT HAVE CHILDREN MISSUS LIPTON HAS ACCUSED THE TIMES OF MISREPRESENTING HER COMMENTS
POLICE IN DALLAS HAVE FOUND AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS AND BOMB MAKING MATERIALS AT THE HOME OF THE MAN WHO MURDERED FIVE OFFICES IN THE CITY MIKE A JOHNSON WHO WAS KILLED BY POLICE AFTER THE ATTACK THAT SAID HE WANTED TO KILL WHITE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WHITE OFFICERS
IT WAS THE NEWS UNDERSTANDS THAT THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN HAS ACCEPTED THE DRAFT FINDINGS OF HER PARTY DEFENCE REVIEW THIS COULD SEE A LABOUR GOVERNMENT UNDER MISTER CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP MAINTAINING BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM HE HAS CAMPAIGNED FOR DISARMAMENT THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER
DAVID CAMERON WILL ANNOUNCE TODAY AT THE NATO SUMMIT OR THAT HE SENDING UP TO FIFTY ADDITIONAL MILITARY PERSONNEL TO AFGHANISTAN IT WILL JOIN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY OTHERS ALREADY IN THE COUNTRY WHO ARE TRAINING AND ADVISING AFGHAN FORCES
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO NINE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER WILL BE EITHER THERESA MAY OR ANDREA LET'S MISSUS LED SOME HAS CHILDREN THIS IS MADE AS NOT A MISSUS LETTERMAN'S DONE AN INTERVIEW WITH THE TIMES WHICH HAS RESULTED IN FRONT PAGE HEADLINE THIS MORNING BEING A MOTHER GIVES ME EDGE ON ME SHE HAS DESCRIBED THAT AS GUTTER JOURNALISM SO SHE'S DISGUSTED BY IT
SO TWO QUESTIONS DID THE TIMES MISREPRESENTED VIEWS AND IF THEY ARE VIEWS WHY SHOULDN'T SHE HAVE EXPRESSED THEM HERE'S PART OF THE INTERVIEW RECORDED BY THE TIMES REPORTER RACHEL SYLVESTER
I DON'T KNOW PLEASE AVAILABLE I'M SURE SHE ONLY REALLY KNOW THEM HONESTLY AND HIS BEDROOM DO YOU LOVE HIM THAT GENUINELY I FEEL BEING IN MY NEEDS
TANGIBLE DAY SHE POSSIBLY HAVE NICE ISN'T IT O.K. BUT I HAVE CHILDREN WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN OH CABLE DIRECTORY HERE WHAT
WELL PENNY MORDEN IS THE ARMED FORCES MINISTER AND A SUPPORTER OF ANDREA SOME YOU SHOULD CAMPAIGN BUT IS ALSO A CONSERVATIVE M.P. AND SHE SUPPORTS THERESA MAY SOUND BUT SHE LET ME COME TO YOU FIRST WHY SHOULD SHE NOT HAVE SAID THAT
WELL I THINK THAT SHE QUALIFY AT HER COMMENTS IMMEDIATELY AT THE POINT THAT SHE SAID IT AND REALLY WE'VE GOT SOME VERY BIG ISSUES FACING THE COUNTRY AND WE SHOULD BE TOOK TALKING ON THOSE ISSUES
EVERYONE HAS THEIR STEAK AND A FUTURE WHETHER YOU'RE YOUNG OR OLD MARRIED OR UNMARRIED AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A PARENT OR AN AUNT AND I REALLY THINK THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON THE ISSUES THAT ARE FACING US THIS WAS NOT A LIFESTYLE CHOICE BY THERESA MAY NOT HAVE CHILDREN AND I I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE BUT WHAT HARM HER SHE DONE BY SAYING IT
I THINK SHE'S SHOWN A LACK OF JUDGEMENT QUITE FRANKLY IN ANY OTHER AREA OF LIFE IF YOU WERE GOING FOR INTERVIEW FOR A JOB YOU WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE ASKED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE CHILDREN ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT QUALIFIES YOU FOR THE JOB WOMEN HAVE THOUGHT LONG AND HARD TO BE TREATED EQUALLY AND I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE QUALITY
OF OF THE TWO CANDIDATES STANDING FOR PRIME MINISTER BUT IT MIGHT BE THAT THAT MANY MOTHERS WOULD SAY BEING A MOTHER GIVES YOU AN EXTRA PERSPECTIVE GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT SORT OF UNDERSTANDING WHICH IF YOU ARE NOT A MOTHER
YOU DON'T HAVE EVERYBODY COMES TO IT HAS DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES AND IT ALL BEING A MOTHER OF COURSE GIVES YOU A PERSPECTIVE BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE THAT IS GOING TO LEAD A COUNTRY THAT HAS TO ACT IN THE INTERESTS OF EVERYONE YOUNG OR OLD MARRIED OR UNMARRIED A MOTHER OR NOT AND I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE ISSUES WHICH ARE FAR WIDER
AND WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE HAS CHILDREN I THINK I'M RIGHT IN SAYING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE CHILDREN I CAN FOR ASKING BUT BUT BUT I'M ASKING BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE PERSONALLY OFFENDED BY THIS I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN WITH MY HUSBAND I HAVE A CHILD FROM A PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP AND I LOST A CHILD AND IT'S DEVASTATING IT'S ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING
AND I HOPE THERE'S A GREAT PERSONAL SADNESS IN NOT HAVING CHILDREN WITH MY MY HER HUSBAND AND YES I AM I HAVE TO SAY QUITE OFFENDED BY THE COMMENTS TO SUGGEST THAT I'M NOT FIT IN SOME WAY OR WOULDN'T BE FIT IF I HADN'T HAD MY DAUGHTER TO OR WOULDN'T HAVE A STAKE IN THE FUTURE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY IT IS ABOUT ACTING ON BEHALF OF EVERYBODY AND THAT INCLUDES BOTH PARENTS AND THOSE THAT AREN'T PARENTS
THANK YOU FOR THAT PENNY MORDANT WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THAT AS A SUPPORTER OF ANDREA LEAD SOME WELL I AGREE THAT WE OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES IN THIS CAMPAIGN AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IS A BIZARRE HEADLINE FROM THE INTERVIEW THAT ANDREA GAVE SHE HAS SAID THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT HER MY SPEAKING OR SPEAKING CLUMSILY
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT SHE SAID IN THE INTERVIEW AND THE CLIP YOU PLAYED EARLIER YOU COULD YOU COULD TRY AND SPIN FROM THAT THE IMPLICATION THAT THE HEADLINE THAT IS IN THERE THE TIMES TODAY BUT SHE DIDN'T LEAVE IT AT THAT SHE ABSOLUTELY WENT ON SEVERAL TIMES IN THE INTERVIEW WHICH WAS VERY FOCUSED ON MOTHERHOOD AND AND RAISE CHILDREN
SHE WENT ON TO CLARIFY THAT THIS SHOULD NOT BE IN ANY WAY SET UP TO SAY THAT THE FACT THAT REZA DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN HAS ANY BEARING ON THIS CONTEST WHATSOEVER IN THAT CASE WHAT DID SHE MEAN WHEN SHE SAID AND I QUOTE VERBATIM
BEING A MUM MEANS YOU HAVE A VERY REAL STAKE IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY A TANGIBLE STEAK IF THAT DOESN'T MEAN NOT BEING A MUM MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SAME STEAK IT'S A VERY CURIOUS CONSTRUCTION
ISN'T IT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT MOTIVATES HER PERSONALLY THAT'S WHAT THAT QUOTE IS LIFTED FROM AND WHAT ALL THE TIME I JUST INTERRUPT YOU THERE FOR JUST ONE SECOND IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF LIFTING QUOTES I HAD THEN WE JUST HEARD A PART OF IT HAVE A BEATEN TRANSCRIPT OF THIS SECTION OF THE INTERVIEW IN FRONT OF ME
AND WHAT SHE SAYS IS GENUINELY EITHER SHE DOES SAY YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT SHE DOES SAY I'M SURE SHE WILL BE REALLY REALLY SAD BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN SO I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE ANDREA HAS CHILDREN TERESA HASN'T BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY HORRIBLE SHE DOES INDEED SAY THAT BUT THEN SHE GOES ON TO SAY BUT GENUINELY I FEEL BEING A MUM MEANS YOU HAVE A VERY REAL STAKE IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY ARE TANGIBLE STEAK AND BESSIE SAYS IT REALLY KEEPS YOU FOCUSED ON WHAT
ARE YOU REALLY SAYING BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS YOU DON'T WANT TO DOWNTURN BUT NEVER MIND LET'S LOOK TO THE TEN YEARS HENCE IT WILL ALL BE FINE MY CHILDREN WILL BE STARTING THEIR LIVES IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO HAVE A I HAVE A REAL STAKE IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO IT'S PERFECTLY CLEAR DOESN'T IT WHAT SHE'LL SAY YOU CAN'T DO THAT I KNOW BUT WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE JOHN HE'S THE FULL AUDIO AND WHERE SHE GOES ON TO TWO ABSOLUTELY STATE THAT THE WHAT THE TIMES IS SAYING AND HAS IMPLIED FROM HER INTERVIEW
IS NOT THE CASE SO I NO NO IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S A REPORTING OF WHAT SHE ACTUALLY SAID YOU CAN'T UNDO WHAT YOU SAID WHAT WILL YOU SAY IF YOU GO ON TO SAY BUT OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE NIECES OR YOU HAVE GOD CHILDREN OR YOU HAVE THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE A STAKE IN THE FUTURE THE COUNTRY AND SHE HAS
REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW SAID THAT MADE IT CLEAR THAT HAVING NIECES OR WHATEVER IT IS IS DIFFERENT SHE IS QUITE EXPLICIT ABOUT THIS BUT THIS IS SOMETHING CHILDREN THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE AND THIS IS I'M AFRAID THIS IS A A A AN ATTEMPT I THINK BUY A PAPER THAT HAS DECLARED FOR THE OTHER CANDIDATE
TO SMEAR ANDREA AND IT IS WE'VE HAD A PRETTY ON EDIFYING I'M AFRAID CONTEST SO FAR INCLUDING PEOPLE TRYING TO PREVENT ANDREA GETTING ON THE BALLOT PAPER SHE HAS BEEN DEMOCRATIC THINKS ALL OF THAT WELL ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE A DEFAULT POSITION IN POLITICS I THINK SHOULD BE OR SHOULDN'T BE IT IS ON THE FACT IS
I'M SORRY LET'S USE THE WEAPONS AT THEIR DISPOSAL DUMPING THAT HIGHLY POLITICS WERE NO I THINK THAT THIS IS THIS IS REALLY POOR AND WE OWE IT TO OUR MEMBERSHIP AND WE OWE IT TO THE COUNTRY WAS SELECTING THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER TO ACTUALLY HAVE A CONTEST WHICH IS IS NOT ABOUT A SLAGGING MATCH BETWEEN TWO CANDIDATES OR ATTEMPT TO SMEAR CANDIDATES IT SHOULD BE ABOUT THE ISSUES OF THE DAY I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH
THAT I MEAN I HOPE THE FULL AUDIO IS IS MADE OF BLOOD PERHAPS THE TIMES WILL MAKE IT A VOTE BUT YOU DON'T DO BUT EVEN IF THEY DON'T SURELY YOU WOULD HAVE TO SEE OF SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO BE THE PRIME MINISTER OF THIS COUNTRY THAT SHE SHOULD THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THE WORDS SHE USES IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION LIKE THIS
IF SHE HAD ENOUGH JUDGEMENT IF SHE IF SHE HAD THE SORT OF JUDGEMENT THAT SAYS WELL HANG ON THAT QUESTION IS A BIT OF A BEAR PIT I'VE GOT TO BE A BIT CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I SAY WHATEVER I MAY OR MAY NOT THINK I'VE GOT TO BE A BIT CAREFUL COS I WANT TO BE PRIME MINISTER AND CERTAIN STANDARDS APPLY SO
THE QUESTION IS DOES SHE HAVE THE JUDGEMENT LET'S PUT ASIDE THE DETAIL OF WHAT SHE SAID SHE HAS LEFT CREATED THE A PARTICULAR IMPRESSION DOES SHE HAVE THE JUDGEMENT THAT IS NEEDED FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERVIEW YOU COULD NOT HAVE COME AWAY FROM THAT INTERVIEW WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THE TIMES HAVE CLEARLY DECIDED TO WRITE A HEADLINE ON WHICH IS
IS SOMETHING THAT SHE DID NOT SAY AND ANDREA IS IS HER MOTHER AND SHE HAS DONE A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK ON FOR PARENTS AND INFLUENCE THAT'S IT THAT'S A MAJOR PART OF WHO SHE IS AND THE SOCIAL REFORM AGENDA BUT SHE SHE PUSHES SHE'S GOING TO BE ASKED ABOUT IT IN INTERVIEWS BUT SHE DID HAVE THE JUDGEMENT TO SAY IN THAT INTERVIEW BUT
DO NOT DON'T YOU DARE CONTRAST THIS WITH THERESA MAY BECAUSE SHE WILL HAVE OTHER FACTORS AS TO WHY SHE PASSIONATELY BELIEVES IN THIS CARDIFF SHIFT IT'S TRUE THAT SHE DID BRING UP THE SUBJECT OF MOTHERHOOD HERSELF IN THIS INTERVIEW THEN YOU WOULD TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW WOULD YOU
WELL I FROM MY UNDERSTANDING I HAVE NOT HEARD THE AUDIO RIGHT BUT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THE THE JOURNALIST WAS REPEATING LY ASKING HER ABOUT THESE POINTS AND IT ACTUALLY MADE ANDREA VERY UNCOMFORTABLE DURING THE COURSE OF THE INTERVIEW ALL RIGHT I'M SORRY I YOU KNOW SHIP ANDREA'S FIRST THOUGHTS WILL BE WITH THERESA IN THIS MATTER IT'S A HORRIBLE THING TO HAVE HAPPEN TO BOTH CANDIDATES BUT WE'VE GOT
RAISE OUR GAME AND ACTUALLY GIVE HER A PROPER PROPER CONTEST TO THE COUNTRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH PENNY MORDEN AND WHEN IT'S BIRCH AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH
THE TIME IS NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND A CARTOON IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES PICTURES THE RACE TO BECOME THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER A HAND VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U. PUSHES OVER A LINE OF DOMINOES WHICH FOR CRUSHING SEVERAL MEN IN SUITS
WHILE ANDREA LEAD SOME CHASES AFTER TERESA MADE TOWARDS THE DOOR OF NUMBER TEN THIS IS MO'S GIVEN THEY NEED TO BE TO THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WHICH ALLOWS THE PAPER TO COMMENT ON THE CHARACTER OF SUMMER TO WHOM IT APPLIES KENNETH CLARK'S PHRASE THE BLOODY DIFFICULT WOMAN LIBERAL POLITICS THE TELEGRAPH OWL NO FUSS NO FANFARE AND ABSOLUTELY NO GRANDSTANDING DILIGENT AND NO NONSENSE SHE LOOKS THE PART
SAM'S THE PART IN ITS LEADING ARTICLE THE TELEGRAPH ENDORSES HER AS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST PERSON TO LEAD THE COUNTRY OUT OF THE E.U. AND THROUGH UNCHARTED WATERS A PROVEN RECORD OF EXPERIENCES CRITICAL IT COMMENTS THE SUN ALSO GIVES HER IT'S BACKING IT SAYS WE BELIEVE THERESA MAY IS THE BEST BET FOR PRIME MINISTER THE PAPER WANTS AN END TO UNCERTAINTY AND CALLS FOR A SUNNY OPTIMISM ABOUT OUR GOLDEN NEW OPPORTUNITY
THE GUARDIAN'S PLEASE THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS THE NEXT P.M. WILL BE FEMALE BUT WHILE IT SAYS THAT WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP IN POLITICS IS BECOMING NORMAL THE PAPER DOESN'T EXPECT EQUALITY TO EXIST IN THE DISADVANTAGES OF CLASS AND RACE WHICH BEAR HARDEST ON WOMEN HAVE ALSO BEEN LIFTED THE MIRROR ASKS WHO WILL BE THE NEW DENNIS TO THE NEXT IRON LADY KHARTOUM BY MATT FOR THE TELEGRAPH PONDERS THE SAME POINT TO CLUB RECLINE IN THEIR ARMCHAIRS ONE SAYS MAY AND LED SOME ARE VYING TO BE THE NEW MAGGIE WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH THEIR HUSBANDS CAN DRINK
THE TIMES PRINCE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB SENT FLIRTATIOUS AND SEXUALLY CHARGED MESSAGES TO A WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES THE PAPER SAYS IT WAS PAST THE MESSAGES BY A SOURCE WHO WAS CONCERNED ABOUT MY CRABS HYPOCRISY IT SAYS THE POLITICIAN MADE NO COMMENT ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOUR IN THE PAPER CONTACTED HIM LAST NIGHT THE TIME SUGGESTS THAT THE CAREFULLY CRAFTED REPUTATION OR MY CRAB AS A COMMITTED CHRISTIAN AND FAMILY MAN
NOW LIES IN TATTERS FORMER LABOUR LEADER NEIL KINNOCK THAT LORD CLINIC STEPPED UP HIS CRITICISM OF JEREMY CORBIN SAYS THE GUARDIAN HE'S DONE AN INTERVIEW THE PAPER IN WHICH EXPANDS ON HIS CALL FOR MY ACCORDING TO STAND DOWN BECAUSE OF HIS BELIEF THAT LABOUR IS A PARLIAMENTARY PARTY NOT A BALLET OR WAGGING SOCIAL PROTEST MOVEMENT LORD KINNOCK SAYS PEOPLE DIVIDE INTO THOSE WHO ARE VAIN AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT AND JEREMY IS A VEIN
IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO NINE WHILE WITH THE CHILCOTT REPORT JUST PUBLISH WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME THIS WEEK LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ THIRTEEN YEARS AGO BUT WHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS FOR THE COUNTRY NOW AND FOR ITS FUTURE ANOTHER SUICIDE ATTACK YESTERDAY KILLED AT LEAST THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE FOR THE SECOND MAJOR ATTACK THIS WEEK
NEARLY THREE HUNDRED WERE KILLED IN A BOMB ATTACK IN BAGHDAD WHERE WE'RE JOINED BY OUR MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BOWEN IN A MOMENT WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO DOCTOR MEYER FACT REVIVE AN M. P. IN THE GOVERNING STATE OF LORD COALITION TO JANE CAN AMOUNT DEPUTY HEAD OF MIDDLE EAST PROGRAMMES AT CHATHAM HOUSE BUT JEREMY IF I CAN START WITH YOU WE'RE SEEING THIS PRESUMABLY WE ARE SEEING THIS UPSURGE IN VIOLENCE FROM SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN LOSING TERRITORY LOSING PLACES LIKE FLU
I THINK SO THEY'VE GONE BACK TO THEIR CORE TACTICS OF PUTTING BOMBS IN PUBLIC PLACES AND BLOWING PEOPLE UP WHICH ARE VERY EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF SPREADING FEAR AND WHAT THEY ALSO DO ITS APPEARS TO BE THEIR OBJECTIVE IS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO WIDEN THE SECTARIAN DIVIDE BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY THEIR STRATEGY IS THERE MORE THAT SHIAS AND SUNNIS HATE EACH OTHER
THE MORE THAT ISLAMIC STATE CAN RETAIN POWER BECAUSE THE SECTARIAN BATTLE IS REALLY HAS BEEN VAN TO A GREAT DEGREE BY UNSCRUPULOUS LEADERS WHO WHO FOUND SECTARIAN FEARS NOW AND WE OF COURSE WE HAVE OF COURSE A MENTION THE CHILCOTT REPORT THIS WEEK WHAT'S THE REACTION THERE TOO
PRETTY UNDERWHELMING I'D SAY IF YOU ASK PEOPLE ABOUT IT MY HAVE EXTENSIVELY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE FIRST WE HAD TO EXPLAIN WHAT'S HAPPENED AND THEY SAY BUT WE KNEW ALL OF THAT STUFF DIDN'T WE AND WHY ON EARTH DIDN'T BRITAIN WHY DIDN'T MY BLAIR WHEN HE WAS REACTING TO IT APOLOGISE TO IRAQIS ABOUT WHAT
WHAT HAPPENED SO I THINK THE THING IS THE CHILCOTT REPORT MAY WELL HAVE DRAWN A BIT OF A LINE FOR THE BRITISH AFTER THE UNDER THE IRAQ TRAUMA BUT THE TRAUMA CONTINUES HERE AS YOU SAID MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE LAST WEEK
BY BOMBS WITHOUT WARNING THAT GO OFF IN PUBLIC PLACES AND THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THEREFORE IT IS A VERY VERY HARD WAY TO LIVE AND FRANKLY THE PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY I THINK A VERY
DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE POLITICAL SYSTEM THE POLITICAL CALLED CLASS IS GETTING AN AWFUL LOT OF OF CRITICISM SAYING THAT THEY ARE INEPT THAT THEIR CORRUPT
WHY DON'T THEY MANAGED TO PROTECT US WHY ISN'T THERE SECURITY AROUND BAGHDAD ALL THESE QUESTIONS GET ASKED BY PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY
IF THAT PROBLEM THE CANCER OF ISLAMIC STATE WAS REMOVED TOMORROW
THEN IRAQ STILL HAS LOADS AND LOADS OF PROBLEMS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENT IS WEAK IF YOU YOU LOOK AT THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE MANY MANY MILITIAS ARMED MILITIAS SOME OF THEM LINKED TO INDIVIDUAL POLITICIANS
THAT SUGGESTS A VERY WEAK CENTRE AND A GREAT POTENTIAL FOR FALLING OUT AND A VIOLENT WAY ONCE A COMMON ENEMY WHICH IS ISLAMIC STATE ARE REMOVED O.K. LET ME BRING IN DOCTOR MOORE OFF LIKE A RIB EYE WHO WAS AN M.P. AS I SAY IN THE GOVERNING STATE OF LAW COALITION ABOUT IT HE'S A FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR BUT HE WAS ALSO APPOINTED A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNING COUNCIL BY THE COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY AFTER THE INVASION IN TWO THOUSAND THREE ADULT A RIB EYE
HOW MUCH DO YOU BLAME THE CURRENT PROBLEMS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT DAY IN DAY OUT ON THE POOR PLANNING FOR POST THE INVASION IN TWO THOUSAND THREE
I THINK THE BLAME IS NOT FOR US TESTING THE WAR BECAUSE I THINK THE WORST ALL OVER THRUST DOWN THE SCENT IS A NOBLE CAUSE APPARENTLY BLENHEIM IS THE LEAVE FOR LEAVING THE COUNTRY AND TOTAL VACUUM FOR THREE AND A HALF MONTHS AFTER NINTH OFF APRIL TWO THOUSAND AND THREE SO THAT IS I THINK THE KEY IS IN THE INSET INSIDE CIRCLES WHILE THE POLITICAL NEARLY TIME DISCUSSING NOW
HOW HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GO OUR BALLET SEWING THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT FOR NUMBER ONE LEAVING THE COUNTRY AND THOUGHT THE VACUUM AND NUMBER TWO IS WALKING OUT OF THE COUNTRY OR RECKLESSLY BUT ARE YOU SAYING I'M ON WITH SAYING NOW I MEAN THIS THIRTEEN YEARS LATER IS THIS STILL THE EFFECTS OF OF THE THE POOR POLICY
WHILE THIS STAR AT THE STARTING POINT IS THEN AS TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND IT IS THAT THAT WOULDN'T OF COURSE WAS COMPOUNDED BY MY SO MANY OTHER FACTORS LIKE THIS THEATRE EVER LIVED BETWEEN THIS YEAR AND SIM IS THE INCOMPETENT AND CORRUPT THEY'RE POLITICALLY LEAD ANTS ON THE SOFA BUT THE THIS TIME I THINK POINT AND THERE'S STILL THE QUOTA SYSTEM
WHICH WAS PUT BY THE COALITION THEN HE'S STILL WORKING AND THAT IS ONE OF CALL QUALITY WHILE I AGREE WITH JEREMY WITH JEREMY BOWEN THIS IS A MALIGNANT CANCER
SPREADING IN THE COUNTY AND THIS THIN AIR DOMINATING THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN THE COUNTRY O.K. LET ME BRING IN JANE KENAN MODE HERE HIS DEPUTY HEAD AS I SAY OF THE MIDDLE EAST PROGRAMME CHATTER MESSES CO EDITOR OF IRAQ TEN YEARS ON THAT THE SET UP OF THE PARLIAMENT NOW WHERE THEY HAVE THESE QUOTAS WHAT ROLE DO YOU SEE IT IS PLAYING IN THE CURRENT PROBLEMS
WELL IT IN TRENCHES SECTARIANISM BUT IT ALSO MAKES THE MISTAKE OF ASSUMING THAT BECAUSE SOMEONE IS FOR INSTANCE ANY OTHER SOON HE'S FEEL REPRESENTED BY THEM AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE MANY IRAQIS FEEL WITH DEEPLY ALIENATED FROM THEIR SO CALLED POLITICAL REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE THEY SEE THEM AS CORRUPT UNABLE TO BRING BACK BASIC ELECTRICITY PROVISION THIRTEEN YEARS AFTER THE WAR SO ACTUALLY PEOPLE WENT MORE FOR THE SECT FOR MY METRES WHAT IS THE ANSWER DO YOU THINK FOR A WAY FORWARD THERE TO LISTEN TO JEREMY THE PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE BLEAK
CAN YOU SEE SOME WAY OF CHARTING A ROUTE THROUGH THIS JUST TO STABILISE IN THE COUNTRY THE WASTE NEEDS TO THINK FAR BEYOND THE ANTI ISIS CAMPAIGN WHICH IS CONSUMING MOST OF ITS ENERGIES AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE AS JEREMY SAID
IN A MUCH DEEPER CONFLICT AND EVEN IF ISIS IS REMOVED YOU GOING TO SEE HUGE FRAGMENTATION AMONG ALL THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN IRAQ THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EFFORT TO BRING IN THE REGIONAL POWERS PARTICULARLY IRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA WHOSE TENSIONS ARE INCREASING AND WHO TENDS A FEW SECTARIANISM IN IRAQ
TO BRING TURKEY IN AS WELL TO TRY TO HELP REALLY GIVE A BASIS OF WEEK BASIC REGIONAL STABILITY TO HELP IRAQ ANOTHER MASSIVE PROBLEM AS THE ECONOMY IRAQ IS ALMOST ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON OIL THE OIL PRICE SLUMPED IT DOESN'T HAVE MONEY TO PAY SALARIES LET ALONE RECONSTRUCT THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN LIBERATED FROM ISIS DOCTOR MY FAKE OUR OWN WE'LL BUY YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE WESTERN INVOLVEMENT ALONG THOSE LINES
WELL I CAN'T AT THE THIS THE LADY WHO JUST TO PUT THE OTHER REGIONAL CONFLICT THAT IS THIS IS SECTARIAN POLARISATION BETWEEN IRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA MANIFESTS ITSELF IN THIS BOUT
THIS IS ONE WHEN ASPECT OF THE THE OTHER ASPECT IS THE IS THE VERY CAUTIOUS VERY CONSERVATIVE APPROACH OF THE WEST IN GENERAL TOWARDS IRAQ WE DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED WE DON'T WANT TO GET OUR HANDS DIRTY WE DON'T WANT TO INTERFERE IN POLITICS BUT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE HAVE YOU HAVE OVERTHROWN ON THIS
THE ISLAND CALLED SADDAM WAS THEN AND YOU MADE A MESS OF IT AND YOU HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO TO TO TO HELP WITH THAT IS TO GET OVER THERE
AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND ONE OF THE PROBLEM AS A SECTARIAN BUT AT THE OTHER PROBLEM IS IS TERRORISM AND THIS TERRORISM IS NOT DID NOT START FROM ABOUT THIS IS THIS THE SEA THE THE
THE GENERAL NOMINATOR AMONG ALL TERRORISTS ARE GROUPS ALL OVER THE WORLD IS THIS TERROR THE GLOBAL TERRORISM IS ONE THING THAT'S EVEN FAITH WE MORE OF
WHICH IS CALLED THE LADDISM FORGET NEITHER INTERRUPT ADDRESSED FORGIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING BUT WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE DOCTOR MY FAIR CHOLERA BY IN A MONTH AND JEREMY BURN OF COURSE THANK YOU MASSES OF SPORE THIS WEEKEND FOOTBALL EUROPEAN FINALS TENNIS WIMBLEDON FINAL CYCLING TOUR DE FRANCE MOTOR RACING THE BRITISH GRAND PRIX AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON PRESUMABLY IF YOU'RE A REAL SPORTS FAN YOU'LL STRUGGLE TO DECIDE WHAT TO WATCH OR MAYBE YOU'LL JUST WHAT'S THE LOT JIM WIPES THE SPORTS COLUMNIST AT THE TELEGRAPH IS THERE SUCH A THING
THESE DAYS JIM AS A REAL SPORTS FAMILIES SO MUCH OF IT OUT THEN IT'S ALL SO DIFFERENT IT IS DIFFERENT BUT WITHIN ALL OF IT THERE'S A KIND OF AWESTRUCK OBSERVATION OF SKILL BRAVERY PHYSICALITY OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THINGS THAT WE MORTALS MAROONED ON A SOFA PHONING IN FOR THE PIZZA JUST CANNOT MATCH AND INTERESTINGLY I THINK EVEN INTO TOMORROW'S FANTASTIC SPREAD OF DIFFERENT SPORTS
YOU CAN CONDENSE IT ALL DOWN TO A KIND OF GLADIATORIAL CONTEST REALLY I THINK YOU CAN I THINK WE HAVE THIS URGE WITHIN AS WE SPORTS FANS I'M MEANT TO BE NEUTRAL THE OH YOU DON'T KNOW BUT WE CAN'T HELP BUT WANT TO CLASSIFY SO WHEN SPOT HAPPENS YOU'RE THINKING WHO'S THE GREATEST WHO'S THE BEST AND TOMORROW IT'S GOING TO BE WHO'S THE BEST BRITISH SPORTSMEN AND THEY ARE REALLY GREAT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT
