THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHRIS IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS MORNING THE DAILY MIRROR IN ITS FRONT PAGE SAYS WE'LL SAVE A STEEL FOCUSING ON THE FACT THE PRINCE WILLIAM IS IN INDIA OF COURSE RAISED THE ISSUE OF BRITISH STEEL WITH INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER ON THAT VISIT PRINCE IGNORES PROTOCOL IT SAYS TO TACKLE INDIAN P.M. OVER BRITT JOBS AXE INSIDE THE PAPER THE TRADE UNIONS ARE DELIGHTED
THAT WILLIAM IS DOING SOMETHING I THINK MINISTERS SHOULD DO THE TIMES REPORT OF THE SAME STORY ON DUKE'S TALKS OF PORT TALBOT'S FUTURE WITH INDIA'S LEADER THAT'S THE WAY THEY PUT IT POINTS OUT THAT MISTER MODI THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER DOES NOT HAVE ANY DIRECT INFLUENCE OVER DECISION TAKEN BY PRIVATE COMPANY AND HE'S NOT SHOWN ANY INCLINATION TO INTERVENE THE DAILY MAIL'S LEAD COMES FROM FIGURES RELEASED BY POLICE YESTERDAY FOLLOWING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PEOPLE TRAFFICKING INDUSTRY THE NATIONAL
CRIME MAY AGENCY FIGURES THE DAILY MAIL'S HEADLINE IS MIGRANTS SMUGGLED TO THE U.K. FOR JUST ONE HUNDRED POUNDS THAT IS APPARENTLY THE PRIZE FOR A FOR A PLACE IN THE BACK OF A LORRY BUT YOU CAN FLY IN BY AIR WITH FALSE PAPERS FOR THIRTEEN AND A HALF THOUSAND IN A SPEED BOAT FROM DUNKIRK IS TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS AND THE PAPERS SAYS THAT SMUGGLERS ARE TURNING TO QUIET HARBOURS SUCH AS WHITSTABLE IN KENT AND NEWHAVEN IN EAST SUSSEX BUT THE TRADE IS RUN VIA TWO HUNDRED SOCIAL MEDIA SITES INCLUDING
FACEBOOK OR SOME OF THOSE RUNNING THE ROOTS ARRIVED VIA THOSE VERY ROOTS BUT MANY HAVE NOW BECOME NATURALISED BRITISH CITIZENS AT THE TIMES HAS A STORY MAN'S NEW MISSION TO THE STARS IT TALKS OF A TWENTY FIVE TRILLION MILE VOYAGE IN SEARCH OF OTHER WORLDS AND THIS IS A NEW INITIATIVE BEING TAKEN BY THE RUSSIAN INTERNET BILLIONAIRE YURI MILNER WITH THE SUPPORT OF STEPHEN HAWKING TO YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WANTED A SPACECRAFT THAT COULD TRAVEL A THOUSAND TIMES FASTER AND TWO THOUSAND TIMES FURTHER
THAN ANY MAN MADE OBJECT HAS GONE BEFORE THE KEY TO IT IS THAT IT DOESN'T CARRY ANY ROCKET FUEL IT ALL POWERED BY LASERS THAT ARE FIRED INTO THESE GREAT SALES THAT WILL HELP HER HEAD IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FIRED FROM EARTH OF COURSE AND ON THE GUARDIAN'S FRONT PAGE ONE HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH CANCER AND KIDNEY FAILURE HAVE MISSED IMPORTANT TREATMENTS BECAUSE AMBULANCES DID NOT ARRIVE TO TAKE THEM TO HOSPITAL THIS IS AFTER THE PRIVATISATION OF N.H.S. NON URGENT TRANSPORT SERVICES IN SUSSEX WHICH THE PAPERS HAS TURNED
INTO A TOTAL SHAMBLES IT SAYS ELDERLY PATIENTS HAVE ENDED UP WAITING MORE THAN FIVE HOURS OF AMBULANCES BEING STUCK IN HOSPITAL FOR LONG PERIODS BECAUSE IT SAYS PATIENT TRANSPORT SERVICES NOW RUN BY THE PRIVATE FROM A CO PERFORMER HAVE PROVED SO UNRELIABLE TEN PAST SIX
WHY DID THE NEWSPAPERS MANY OF THEM NOT PRINT A STORY ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A POLITICIAN AND A WOMAN WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A SEX WORKER WAS IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS A LEGITIMATE STORY OR BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO OFFEND THE POLITICIAN IN QUESTION A MAN HE WAS NOW THE CULTURE SECRETARY AND OF COURSE IN CHARGE OF REGULATING THE PRESS THAT IS SOMETHING THE INDEPENDENT JOURNALIST JAMES CUE SICK HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO FOR THE PAST FIVE MONTHS HE TOLD NEWSNIGHT THAT HE BELIEVED THE STORY DID MERIT PUBLICATION
IF YOU LIKE DETAILS OF HIS PRIVATE LIFE WHICH BASICALLY I THINK THE PUBLIC HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT IF THIS INDIVIDUAL IS MAKING THESE DECISIONS
A DECISION THAT WOULD AFFECT THE WAY PEOPLE LOOK AT NEWSPAPERS THE WAY NEWSPAPERS BEHAVE THE WAY TO B. B. C. AS A LIGHT OF IT YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS MAN'S PRIVATE LIFE WELL THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT BUT HE'S TRYING TO HOLD BACK FROM YOU BUT ROY GREENSLADE PROFESSOR OF JOURNALISM AT CITY UNIVERSITY IN LONDON AND A FORMER EDITOR OF THE DAILY MIRROR DEFENDED THE PRESSES DECISION NOT TO GO PUBLIC
WELL YOU'VE GOT TO THINK WHEN IT HAPPENED BUT IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER LEVERSON THEY WOULD ALL BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD A PUBLIC INTEREST JUSTIFICATION THEY WOULD HAVE ALL TAKEN SEPARATE LEGAL ADVICE THEY WOULD HAVE ALL LOOKED AT THEIR CODE OF PRACTICE
AND I THINK IT'S A BIT MUCH TO CASTIGATED NEWSPAPERS FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR ONCE BY DECIDING THAT THIS WAS A STORY ABOUT A MAN WHO WAS UNMARRIED WHO HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN WHO HADN'T TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS A SEX WORKER WHEN THEY WHEN HE DID NO HE ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP I CAN'T SEE THAT THERE WAS A GENUINE STORY
THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT WILL BE DEBATING LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX THE FORMER LORD CHIEF JUSTICE LORD JUDGE HAS SAID THAT PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY IS BEING UNDERMINED BY SO CALLED HENRY THE EIGHTH CLAUSES WHICH ENABLE MINISTERS TO CHANGE THE LAW THROUGH STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS AVOIDING PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY HE'S BEEN SPEAKING EXCLUSIVELY TO A LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CLIVE COLEMAN WHO'S ON THE LINE HOW THESE INSTRUMENTS USE CLIVE AND WHAT IS THE PROBLEM US AS FAR AS HE'LL JUDGE SEES THEM
HE MAKES THE POINT THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY ISN'T EXECUTIVE SOVEREIGNTY IT ISN'T MINISTERIAL OR GOVERNMENT SOVEREIGNTY IT IS OR IT SHOULD BE THE ANTITHESIS OF ALL OF THOSE THINGS PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY EXISTS HE SAYS TO PROTECT US FROM AN OVER MIGHTY EXECUTIVE AND IT'S THE FEAR OF PARLIAMENT BECOMING A RUBBER STAMP FOR THE EXECUTIVE
THAT LIES BEHIND THE CONCERN THAT HE HAS ABOUT THESE SO CALLED HENRY THE EIGHTH CLOTHES IT'S JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THEY ORIGINATE FROM THE FIFTEEN THIRTY NINE STATUTE OF PROCLAMATIONS WHICH IS WIDELY BELIEVED TO HAVE GIVEN DICTATORIAL POWERS TO THE KING WIDELY BUT INCORRECTLY IN LAW JUDGES WHEW
IN MODERN TIMES THESE CAUSES ENABLE MINISTERS TO CHANGE TO A MOUND OR TO ABOLISH STATUTES WITHOUT PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY AS YOU SAY BY MEANS OF SECONDARY LEGISLATION KNOWN A STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS AND MINISTERS CAN DELEGATE THAT POWER TO AMANDA ABOLISH IT LORD JUDGE SITES THE CHILDREN'S ACT WHERE HE SAYS THE POWER CAN BE DELEGATED BY THE MINISTER TO ANY PERSON TO YOU OR ME BUT PRESUMABLY HE SAYS ONE WHO IS ACCEPTABLE TO THE EXECUTIVE AND JUST TO GIVE A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THIS SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY
HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN LAID BEFORE PARLIAMENT PREPARED BY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND ONLY SEVENTEEN HAVE BEEN REJECTED AND THE LAST TIME THE COMMONS REJECTED A STATUTORY INSTRUMENT WITH THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE LORDS HAVE ONLY REJECTED SIX AND PEOPLE REMEMBER THE LAST ONE WAS IN THE AUTUMN IT CAUSED A SORT OF STORM AND THAT CONCERNED REGULATIONS NOT PRIMARY LEGISLATION UNDER THE TAX CREDIT ACT ABOUT A FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION POUND CUT
TO THOSE TAX CREDITS NOW THIS IS THE WAY LAW JUDGE SUMMED UP HIS CONCERNS TO ME I'M NOT SAYING THE EXECUTIVE IS SEIZING POWER I'M SAYING THAT OUR CONSTITUTION PROCESSES ARE EVOLVING IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE TO COIN A PHRASE USED TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO HAS INCREASED HIS INCREASING AND OUGHT TO BE AT THE MINUTE
I SUPPOSE THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF THE USE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS MIGHT BE THAT THEY ARE EFFICIENT THAT THEY ARE WHERE A WAY TO DEAL WITH THE VOLUME OF LEGISLATION THAT THAT NEEDS TO GO THROUGH PARLIAMENT ALL THAT THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO GET THROUGH PARLIAMENT YES AND I THINK HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT AND HE SAYS THIS IS A PLACE FOR THEM BUT HE BELIEVES THAT BECAUSE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS SO BUSY WITH PRIMARY LEGISLATION SO IT DOESN'T SCRUTINISED THESE CLAUSES OR OR STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS
HE'S WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE LORDS COMMITTEES WHICH DO LOOK AT THEM THEY OFTEN COMPLAIN ABOUT THESE CAUSES BUT THOSE COMPLAINTS GO IN THE MAIN UNHEEDED AND SO THEIR PROVENANCE IS UNDERMINING PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY SO HE WHAT HE'S PROPOSING IS A JOINT COMMITTEE OF BOTH HOUSES TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND HE HINTS AT A SORT OF RECASTING OF THE COMMITTEE SYSTEM SO THAT THERE IS GREATER SCRUTINY OF THE CLAUSES
CLIVE COLEMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BE STALKER SPEAKING TO JACK STRAW ABOUT THIS LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME IT IS A QUARTER PAST SIX WHERE WE WERE HEARING THE I.M.F. VERDICT YESTERDAY ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND OF COURSE ON THE POSSIBILITY OF BRICKS IT TOO WELL THAT'S BECAUSE THE I.M.F. SPRING MEETING IS STARTING IN WASHINGTON HERE TO TELL US ABOUT THAT AND MORE OF THE BUSINESS
MORNING MORNING OFFICIALS AT THE I.M.F. DON'T TEND TO TALK IN LANGUAGE THAT IS INTENDED TO ALARM BUT THEIR LATEST ASSESSMENT OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY FOR ALL ITS TECHNICAL JARGON IS BLEAK EIGHT YEARS AFTER THE START OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IT SAYS GROWTH HAS BEEN TOO SLOW FOR TOO LONG THE WORLD ECONOMY IS FRAGILE AND SO POLITICIANS HAVE LESS ROOM FOR ERROR THE I.M.F. HAS THEREFORE DOWNGRADED IT OUTLOOK FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY FOR THE FOURTH TIME
IN THE PAST YEAR WITH US IS A FORMER ADVISOR TO THE I.M.F. BOARD PROFESSOR NYREE WOODS WHO WAS NOW THE DEAN OF THE BLACK NICK SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT AND JOINS US FROM OXFORD GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHY DOES THE I.M.F. THEN SEE DARK CLOUDS EVERYWHERE
IT PAINTS A STORY OF SYLVIA RISKS NOT JUST IN THE ADVANCED ECONOMIES WHICH IS STILL STAGNATING AND IN WHICH THERE'S REAL FINANCIAL STRESS BUT ACROSS THE EMERGING MARKETS YOU REMEMBER FIVE YEARS AGO EVERYONE WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT BRAZIL RUSSIA INDIA SOUTH AFRICA SORT OF DRIVING GROWTH ALONGSIDE CHINA BUT THOSE COUNTRIES ARE ALL STAGNATING IN BRAZIL YOU'VE GOT A POLITICAL CRISIS IN RUSSIA YOU'VE GOT HUGE SLOW DOWN
I'M IN SOUTH AFRICA YOU'VE GOT ALSO A POLITICAL CRISIS AND THEN LOW OIL PRICES EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE SLIGHTLY RISING NOW BUT THEY'RE STILL VERY LOW AND WE WERE EXPORTING COUNTRIES A SUFFERING THERE'S A REAL RISK THAT ALTHOUGH CHINA IS STABLE AT THE MOMENT THEY COULD BE MORE A SHARP A SLOWDOWN IN CHINA WHICH WOULD AFFECT
ALL COUNTRIES EXPORTING TO CHINA AND AND THEN WHAT THEY PAINT IS THE ON TOP OF ALL OF THOSE ECONOMIC HEADWINDS THEY POINT OUT THAT ALL THE POLITICAL RISKS ANYONE ON THOSE POLITICAL RISKS
THEY POINT TO NOT JUST THE RISK OF A BRICKS IT THROAT BEING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE BUT THE FACT THAT THE BRICKS IT REFERENDUM THE VERY FACT OF HOSTING THE REFERENDUM IS ALREADY HAVING A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE BRITISH ECONOMY O.K. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE GLOBAL PICTURE THE I.M.F. HAS DOWNGRADED IT'S FORECAST FOUR TIMES OVER THE PAST YEAR OR THINGS REALLY DETERIORATING AT SUCH A RAPID PACE
YEAH I THINK ONE THING YOU CAN PRETTY CONFIDENTLY SAY IS THAT THE I.M.F. ALMOST ALWAYS OVER IS ALMOST ALWAYS OVER OPTIMISTIC IT
RIGHT THINGS ARE EVEN WORSE THAN THEY SAY SO YEAH OW YOU TAKE THEIR WARNINGS VERY SERIOUSLY I MEAN IF ANY IF THE I.M.F. IS OFTEN CRITICISED FOR NOT WARNING CLEARLY ENOUGH IF IMPENDING CRISES BUT BUT SO SO HERE THIS IS A VERY SOBERING REPORT MARKETS GUESS THIS MORNING IS LAURA THE SENIOR INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT INVEST TECH WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MORNING LAURA MORNING OUR FINANCIAL MARKETS AS GLOOMY AS THE I.M.F.
I THINK FINANCIAL MARKETS AND HOOKED ON TO THE FACT THAT CHINA'S GROWTH HAD BEEN UPGRADED FROM SIX POINT THREE TO SIX POINT FIVE UM IN CHINA LIKE THAT HAS BEEN SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY OVER THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS TRYING TO OVERTAKE THE U.S. AS THEY'RE THE WORLD'S LARGEST ECONOMY SO I THINK MARKETS FOCUSED MORE ON THAT
THEN DOWNGRADES TO PERHAPS THE YUKI EGG GROWTH PROSPECTS PERHAPS BROUGHT ON BY THAT THE BREAKS THAT REFERENDUM AND THAT SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON MARKETS REACTED QUITE POSITIVELY TOWARDS THE DIVISION OF THE I.M.F. FIGURES RIGHT AND NYREE WORKED WHEN THE I.M.F. SAYS THAT POLITICIANS HAVE LESS ROOM FOR ERROR WHAT EXACTLY DO THEY MEAN
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT COUNTRIES BOTH INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES THEN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND BRITAIN AS WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE FACING BOTH FINANCIAL TIGHTENING SO THERE'S THEY'VE GOT LESS ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE IN ALREADY THEY'RE FACING A SLOWDOWN IN ALL OF THEIR MARKETS SO THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO HAVE INCREASING CAPACITY
AND THEY'RE ALSO FACING A LESS AND LESS EFFECTIVE USE OF MONETARY POLICY SO THE QUANTITATIVE EASING AND RELAX MONETARY POLICY THAT THEY'VE USED TO TRY TO DRIVE GROWTH SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IS WORKING LISTEN GRACE WELL IN FACT NOW IT'S BEING DESCRIBED BY SOME AS A VICIOUS CYCLE THAT THAT'S GOING TO DRIVE EACH ECONOMY INTO MORE DEBT AND LACE GROWTH RIGHT THAT CLEARLY DOES NOT SOUND GOOD NOW HE WOULD STAY WITH US IF YOU WERE AT LAUREL ARMY FROM INVEST TECH THE OIL PRICE
HE'S RISING OF LATE WHY IS THAT AND DOES THAT SUGGEST THAT THE I.M.F. IS PERHAPS TOO GLOOMY BECAUSE IT THE RISING PRICE WOULD SUGGEST THAT DEMAND FOR OIL IS GOING UP AND THEREFORE THERE'S MORE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
I THINK AND PROCESS THE YE OLDE PER SET THERE'S A WEEKEND MEETING UP OR PICK AND IT'S INTO SIR PETER THEY MAY WELL BE AN AGREEMENT
TO FREEZE OR TO CAP THEIR SUPPLY OF OIL WERE ALSO THINKING THAT RUSSIAN AND VENEZUELA MADE ALSO BE KEEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS AND THAT SAID DESPITE THE FACT IRAN WILL NOT AND BE PARTICIPATING YOU REMEMBER THAT SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN LIFTED WITH IRAN AND THEY'RE KEEN TO TO DEPRECIATE AS MUCH OIL AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN SO WITH OIL IT SORT OF ALMOST FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A BARREL
FOR MOST PEOPLE IT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT PERHAPS FIFTY TO SIXTY DOLLARS A BATTLE OVER THE MEDIUM TERM RATHER THAN THE SORT OF LOWS OF TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS WE SAW RECENTLY RIGHT NOW YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME OUR MARKETS GUESS YESTERDAY JAMES BEVAN DESCRIBED THE FOURTEEN MILLION POUND PAY PACKET OF B.P.'S BOSS BOB DUDLEY AS UTTERLY EXTRAVAGANT THE GUARDIAN SAYS THIS MORNING THAT THE PAY OF FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED CHIEF EXECUTIVE HAS GONE UP SIX PERCENT OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVE SHAREHOLDERS JUST HAD ENOUGH OF HIGH CORPORATE PAY WELL
THERE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN MORE INVESTOR ACTIVITY SURROUNDING AND CHIEF EXECUTIVES AND AND BENEFITS AND THERE'S BEEN FAR MORE OF AN EMPHASIS TOWARDS AND MANAGEMENT BEING PAID FOR HER RESULTS BASED ON COMPANY PERFORMANCE SO IT'S A BIT DISAPPOINTING
TO THEN LAYER AND THAT THE CHIEF EXEC AND EARNS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE TIMES MORE THAN THE AVERAGE WORKER AND THAT'S UP FROM ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TIMES IN TWO THOUSAND TEN SO I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED A EXECUTIVE PEA AND TO BE MORE CURTAILED A BEARING IN MIND MORE INVESTOR ACTIVISM BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT
WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT THE FEARS OVER THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BUT AT LEAST THE BANKS ARE FIXED RIGHT WELL WRONG IT SEEMS THE STATE OF ITALY'S BANKS'S WORRYING MANY IN THE AIR IS AN AREA OF COURSE STILL TRYING TO WARD OFF DAMAGING DEFLATION SO A MULTI BILLION EURO FUND IS BEING SET UP TO HELP THOSE ITALIAN LENDERS GROANING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF BAD DEBT FOLLOWS WEEKS OF EMERGENCY MEETINGS INVOLVING THE GOVERNMENT
AND CENTRAL BANKER WITH US IS FILIPPO OUR TEA SENIOR CREDIT ANALYST AT IRMA'S INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT MORNING MORNING HOW SHAKY THEN IS ITALY'S BANKING SECTOR
DESTRUCTION IS QUITE FRAGILE BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF BAD LEARNT IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT IS EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF DYLON INTO CYLON BOOK AT TWENTY TO PERCENTAGE OF DIPPY AND THAT'S A RESULT BECAUSE UM TO AND IS VERY LOW I AM TOM BANKS PROBABLY THREE OUT OF FOUR
YOU'RE A INTIMIDATED BETTER BANKS AND OUT ALSO IS THE FUNCTION OF SAP POWER ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE HAVE YOU TELL YOU OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS RIGHT U.K. BAILED OUT ITS BANKS DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS ITALY'S WERE NOT IN ALL THAT MUCH BETTER SHAPE AT THE TIME SO WHY DIDN'T THEY BAIL OUT THEIR BANKS THEN
IF YOU DID THE DIZZY ANSWERS BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T NO MINE NO MONEY LEFT TO SAWREY DID YOU WENT WELL ABOVE UNDER PER CENT OF PUBLIC EVERYONE WELL ABOVE AND A PERCENTAGE WOULD YOU PIERCE I DO WHERE'S MORE MONEY AVAILABLE TO PROP UP TO BAGS RIGHT THIS PLAN IS TO HAVE A FUND WORTH ABOUT FIVE BILLION POUNDS FOR BANK RESCUES IS THAT ENOUGH TO WARD OFF A POTENTIAL COLLAPSE OF A BANK HE'S FOUND HIS FOOT OR MAIN REASON I'M STOOL BACK BACKSTOP
EQUITY RAISING OFF SOME WEAKER BOUNCER AND SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR TWENTY FOOT FOR THE SHORT TERM THEN BEQUESTS WHAT REMAIN FOOTY NOT PERFORMING LANCE IT WAS DEPENDS ON THE LAVATORY JUST KEMP CAN APPLY
RIGHT I SEE THAT WILL FORM I HAVE I.M.F. ADVISER PROFESSOR NYREE WOODS IS STILL WITH US DO YOU THINK THIS IS A BIG RISK TO THE AREA
I DO BED AND IT'S NOT JUST ITALY I MEAN THE BIGGER THE JOB OF REPAIRING BANKS THE JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT EUROPE'S BANKS WHERE THEY'RE GERMAN BANKS FRENCH BANKS OR ITALIAN BANKS AROUND AT OUR ADEQUATELY CAPITALISED IS NOT OVER
THAT'S JUST AN ONGOING PROBLEM AND EACH ACROSS THE EUROZONE
GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP KEEP WORKING ON THAT RIGHT O.K. NYREE WOODS UNTIL ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL AFTER ALL THAT GLOOM WE NEED A BIT OF GOOD NEWS I THINK SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE IN THE U.K. HAS THE FASTEST RATE OF JOBS GRACE NOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION HAS BEEN OBVIOUS FOR YEARS IT WAS OF COURSE LONDON UNTIL NOW BECAUSE ACCORDING TO A SURVEY FROM NAT WEST IT IS YORKSHIRE AND THE HUMBER DANIEL FELL IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF DONCASTER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
ON THE BACK OF THE HOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC REGENERATION PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED ACROSS THE REGION ON THE BACK OF SOME GOOD EMITTING WINS AND ACTUALLY YOU'RE A BIT OF FAITH THAT SEEMED LIKE EVOLUTION
THE RESOURCES IN THE LEAD AS WE KNOW
GOING FORWARD SIGHT SEBASTIAN BURNSIDE AS WITH US HE'S A SENIOR ECONOMIST AT THAT WEST WHICH CARRIED OUT THIS SURVEY MORNING SEBASTIAN SO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN YORKSHIRE AND THE HUMBER TO CREATE SO MANY JOBS SO I THINK YOU'RE GETTING A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT BUT THE CLEAREST THING YOU SEE WHEN YOU GO AND TALK TO BUSINESSES ACROSS THE REGION IS THAT THERE IS MORE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN OUTLOOK AND THEIR OWN ABILITY TO GENERATE VALUE
AND ONE OF THE FEATURES WHICH I THINK IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DETAIL OF THESE NUMBERS IS THAT IT'S THE CITY OF LEEDS WHICH IS GENERATING DOUBLE
DIGIT JOB GROWTH OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS AND THAT'S A FANTASTIC RESULT FOR A CITY THAT SIZE RIGHT AND SO IS THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY THEN WINNING AT THE EXPENSE
OF OTHERS IS IT ESSENTIALLY SUCKING ACTIVITY FROM ELSEWHERE SUCH AS LONDON WHICH NOW HAS INCREDIBLY HIGH COSTS I THINK THIS IS MORE OF A CATCH UP STORY THAN IT IS ABOUT COMPETING LONDON AWAY
AFTER ALL IF YOU COMPARE JOB LEVELS TODAY WITH WHERE THEY WERE RIGHT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ATE BEFORE THE RECESSION LONDON HIS LUNG HAS EMPLOYMENT LEVELS WHICH ARE FOURTEEN PERCENT HIGHER
COMES CLOSE TO THAT IN THE U.K. SO THIS IS VERY WELCOME IT SHOWS A BROADENING OF THE U.K.'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY OUT ACROSS A NUMBER OF REGIONS YORKSHIRE BUT ALSO NORTH WESTERN NORTH EAST WE'RE IN THE TOP FIVE PERFORMING REGIONS OF THE RESTAURANT'S RIGHT THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING IN RECENT YEARS ABOUT REBALANCING ECONOMIC GROWTH ACROSS THE COUNTRY RELYING LESS ON LONDON AS THE CENTRE OF ECONOMIC POWER IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE OR NOT
THIS IS A BIT TOO EARLY FOR US TO SAY THE NORTHERN POWER HOUSE IS DRIVING THESE FIGURES WE'VE SEEN POWERS DEVOLVED WE'RE NOW LOOKING TO SEIZE THEIR POLICIES
BEEN CHANGED ON THE BACK OF THOSE POWERS AND THEN WE CAN REALLY START TO SEE HOW THIS NEW WAVE THAT EVOLUTION IS AFFECTING THE ECONOMY RIGHT SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE CANNOT TELL HIM WHETHER THIS IS DOWN TO GOVERNMENT POLICY THE NORTHERN POWER HOUSE WHICH IS GEORGE OSBORNE'S BABY IT'S TOO EARLY FOR A CRITIC IN THAT BOX

THE TIME IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WAITING DEAD IS FACING QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS PRESS REGULATION ROLE AFTER IT EMERGED NEWSPAPERS HAD KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT HE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ESCORT BEFORE ENTERING GOVERNMENT OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH JOINS US NOW HOW MUCH OF AN ISSUE DO YOU THINK THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME
WELL LET ME JUST ONE PACKET A BIT SORT OF THREE ELEMENTS TO IT IT SEEMS TO ME ONE IS A FAIRLY HUMDRUM STORY ABOUT AN M.P. WHO HAS AN AFFAIR WITH A PROSTITUTE THE SECOND ELEMENT IS WHY THE PRICE DIDN'T PUBLISH THE STORY EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW ABOUT IT FROM THE THIRD ELEMENT WHICH IS THE REALLY CRITICAL ELEMENT IS HOW FAR IF IN ANY WAY THIS INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT POLICY ON LEVERSON THE FIRST ELEMENT JOHN WIDOW HAS CONFIRMED LAST NINE STATEMENT HE HAD A SIX MONTH AFFAIR WITH A SEX WORKER WITH SHE TERMINATED
ONCE HE BECAME AWARE SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE THIS ENDED BEFORE HE BECAME SHADOW CULTURE CULTURE SECRETARY WHAT
GIVES MORE SPICE TO THE STORY AS WHY A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS INCLUDING THE MAIL ON SUNDAY THE MIRROR THE SUN AND THE INDEPENDENT CHOSE NOT TO PUBLISH THE STORY EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE AWARE OF IT THEY SAY THEY CHOSE NOT TO DO SO BECAUSE I WASN'T IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THE THIRD ELEMENT
IS THE ACCUSATION FROM THE CAMPAIGN GROUP HACKED OFF AND FROM LABOUR'S CHRIS BRYANT THAT THE REASON THEY CHOSE NOT TO PUBLISH WAS TO KEEP IT AS A THREAT IF YOU LIKE OVER THE HEAD
OF JOHN WILTING DEL TO ENSURE OR PRESSURISE HIM AGAINST TAKING ANY FURTHER STEPS TO PROCEED WITH THE LEVISON INQUIRY NOW MY WITTLE GIRL IN THE STATEMENT CATEGORICALLY DENIES IT HAD ANY INFLUENCE WHATSOEVER AND ANY DECISIONS HE'S MADE HIS CULTURE SECRETARY BUT THAT IS WHY THIS STORY
MATTERS THE QUESTION MARKS ABOUT WHETHER IN ANYWAY IT IMPACTED ON GOVERNMENT POLICY AT THE TIME OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP HE WAS AS YOU SAY AN M. P. RATHER THAN A THAN A MINISTER AND THE POINTY BECAME A MINISTER WHAT DID NUMBER TEN KNOW ABOUT IT THEY DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING HE DID NOT INFORM THEM OF ANYTHING NUMBER TEN NOW SAY JOHN WISHING DALE AS A SINGLE MAN IT'S A PRIVATE AFFAIR AND THAT'S IT
THE CHARGE IS THIS THOUGH IT IS I SUPPOSE IN THE EYES OF MANY CURIOUS THAT A STORY WHICH YOU IMAGINE MOST RED TOP NEWSPAPERS WOULD BE LICKING THEIR LIPS TO PUBLISH CHOSE NOT TO DO SO AND CERTAINLY IT
CONTRASTS WITH THEIR APPROACH TO THE CURRENT ATTEMPTS TO OVERTURN THE INJUNCTION BARRING PUBLICATION OF DETAILS ABOUT THE CELEBRITY COUPLE THAT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS IT CERTAINLY CONTRAST WITH SAY
THE COVERAGE OF STORIES AROUND DAVID MELLOR OR MAX MOSLEY AND THE PUBLIC DEFENCE ARGUMENT I MEAN IF YOU WORK IN NEWS
YOU CAN GET ROUND YOU CAN FIND A PUBLIC INTEREST ALMOST PUBLISHING ANYTHING FRANKLY WHETHER IT BE ON SECURITY GROUNDS WHETHER BEYOND THE USE OF EXPENSES I MEAN YOU CAN USUALLY FIND A REASON TO PUBLISH A STORY NOW
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT IN THE NEW CLIMATE OF LEVERSON NEWSPAPERS JUST THOUGHT NO WAY ARE WE GOING ANYWHERE NEAR THIS
IT IS ALSO QUITE POSSIBLE THE JOHN WICCAN GIRL HAS NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGED HIS STANCE ON LEVISON HAD PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT LEVISON TWO MUST GO AHEAD BUT ARE TO MY MIND JOHN WISHING GIRL HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY SCEPTICAL ABOUT HEAVIER PRESS REGULATION AND I SUPPOSE THE LAST ELEMENT OF IT AS A SORT OF THE IRONY HERE OF
PRIVACY CAMPAIGNERS ATTACKING THE PRESS NOW FOR AS WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING OR NOT PUBLISHING A STORY ABOUT A MAN'S PRIVATE LIFE ALMOST BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO BE DEBATING THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE PRESS ON THIS STORY A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE BREAK WITH A TABLOID EDITOR AND THE HEAD OF CAMPAIGNING GROUP HACKED OFF IT'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN
WITH THE DEBATE ABOUT IMMIGRATION CRUCIAL TO MANY PEOPLE'S VIEWS OF WHETHER WE SHOULD STAY HERE AND NOT GET OUT OF THE ANY NEW ANALYSIS OF WHO'S COMING HERE FROM WHERE AND WHY HE'S BOUND TO GET ATTENTION OR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DOMINIC HAS YANI HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE LATEST STUDY WHICH SHOWS DOMINIC OR CONFIRMED REALLY THE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM SOUTHERN EUROPE NOT JUST FROM EASTERN EUROPE
THAT'S RIGHT IS SOME REALLY INTERESTING FIGURES FROM THE MIGRATION OBSERVATORY WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH UNIT AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY WHICH IS TRYING TO PUT IMPARTIAL INFORMATION INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN TO ASSIST THE PUBLIC DEBATE ABOUT MIGRATION AND ITS ROLE IN BRITISH LIFE AND IN ESSENCE WHAT THEY FOUND
WHAT YOU WE KNOW ALREADY THAT THE NUMBER OF E.U. NATIONALS IN THE U.K. IT'S GONE UP TO ABOUT THREE POINT THREE MILLION AND THAT PROBABLY DOES A BIT GONE UP BY ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THOSE WE KNOW FROM EASTERN EUROPE A NUMBER OF POLES IN THE U.K. IT'S GONE UP BY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND A LOT MORE REMAINS BUT COMING UP THE INSIDE WHAT'S THE MIGRATION OBSERVATORY SAY THEY'LL SEEING IS MORE WORKERS FROM SPAIN
ITALY AND PORTUGAL THEY NOW ACCOUNTS FOR TWENTY FOUR PERCENT A QUARTER OF THE GROWTH AND THAT APPEARS TO BE DRIVEN BY A REAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS IN THOSE COUNTRIES SO WHILE YOU'VE GOT SOME WORKERS COMING TO THE U.K. FROM EASTERN EUROPE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN WAGES YOU'VE GOT WORKERS ALSO COME FROM SOUTHERN EUROPE BECAUSE QUITE SIMPLY THEY CAN'T GET A JOB AT HOME AND THE LOOKING AT THE U.K.'S AN EASY OPTION
A GOOD OPTION FOR THEM TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY SO QUITE SIMPLY THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT AS IT WERE THE LEVEL BENEFITS HERE OR A FACT THAT OTHER FAMILY OR FRIENDS ARE HERE IT IS QUITE SIMPLY IT EASIER TO GET A JOB AND YOU'RE PRETTY LIKELY TO GET A JOB COMPARED WITH AN ECONOMY THAT IS PRETTY FLAT ON HIS BACK
YEAH BECAUSE THREE QUARTERS THOSE PEOPLE WHO COME INTO THE U.K. FROM THE E. YOUSSEF THERE COMING FOR WORK AND ALMOST HALF HER THOUGH THOSE SAY WE I'VE GOT A JOB ALREADY THEY GET OFF THE COACH ALL THE PLAIN WHERE THEY LANDS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL SPECIFIC TRIGGER FACTORS WHAT WON IT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL DECISION THEY'RE MAKING BEFORE THEY'RE ACTUALLY TAKING THAT JENNY WHAT MIGRATION OBSERVATORY FOUND WAS A REAL MIXTURE
OF INTENTION SO YOU DO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE POSSIBLY COME IN BECAUSE THEY HAD THIS LOOK AT THE BENEFITS IN THE WAGES AND THINK I CAN GET TAX CREDITS IF I'M WORKING AND THAT'S GOOD FOR ME AND MY FAMILY YOU'VE GOT SO PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING QUITE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AT HOME AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT NOBODY CAN BE REALLY QUITE SURE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE LONG TERM IF FOR INSTANCE THE SPANISH AND ITALIAN COLONIES REALLY PICK UP THE MOON AT THE HUGE YOUTH EMPLOY UNEMPLOYMENT IN THOSE NATIONS STARTS TO DROP IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT
THERE'S THE MANY MARGARET'S COMING FROM THOSE COUNTRIES WILL START TO REVERSE BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HOME ANY MORE IT'S A VERY COMPLEX SITUATION MIGRATION OBSERVATORY SAY ONE FINAL THING THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WAS WHETHER THE LIVING WAGE AND THEIR PLANS TO PROGRESSIVELY RACE I SAID THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS WHAT EFFECT THAT WILL HAVE ON JOBS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THAT MAY BE A PULL FACTOR IN ITSELF IT MAY ACTUALLY LEADS IN LOWER EM PLUMMETED NATIONALS HAS COME
TAXI MODERNISE THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY IS MANY PEOPLE DOMINIC HAS YANI THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME HE'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW IT WAS HER NAME FEW OUTSIDE PANAMA KNEW UNTIL THE LEAK OF ALL THOSE PAPERS BUT THE LAW FIRM MOSS ECK VON SECKER IS NOW KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD LAST NIGHT PROSECUTORS RAIDED THEIR OFFICES IN PANAMA CITY I'VE BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT THAT TO A CENTRAL AMERICA KATIE CENTRAL AMERICA CORRESPONDENT KATIE WATSON WHO'S BASED IN MEXICO CITY
WELL ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE OBJECTIVES OF THE RAID ON TUESDAY WAS TO OBTAIN DOCUMENTS THAT WERE RELATED TO THIS HUGE LEEK WHICH ACCUSES THE COMPANY OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES BUT SINCE THE LATE MOSS THAT VON SECKER HAS DENIED ANY WRONGDOING SAYING THE ONLY CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED WAS THE COMPUTER HACK ITSELF SO I GUESS IT IS IT'S PARALLEL IF YOU LIKE WAS LIKE VON SECKER MAINTAINS THAT IT'S ONLY SET UP OFFSHORE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS ANONYMOUS SHELL COMPANIES FOR CLIENTS AND WAS NOT INVOLVED IN HOW THOSE ACCOUNTS WERE USED SO CERTAINLY
WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK ITSELF PANAMA NOW FINDS ITSELF ON A LIST OF WHAT IS CALLED UNCOOPERATIVE COUNTRIES WHICH I IMAGINE IS QUITE SERIOUS FOR IT FINANCIALLY WHAT ARE THEY SAYING WHAT ARE THE POLITICIAN SAYING ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE COUNTRY AFTER THIS
WELL PANAMA'S PRESIDENT ON GOT LOST BARBELLA HE'S PLEDGED TO SET UP AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION OF EXPERTS TO LOOK INTO THE WORK THE WORKING PRACTICES OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND ALSO FIND A WAY OF IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY THIS CERTAINLY A FEELING THAT PERHAPS PANAMA'S BEING SINGLED OUT PANAMA'S NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY AND PANAMA PERHAPS HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING WORSE THAN OTHER TAX HAVENS LAST YEAR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PUBLISHED A LIST OF OFFSHORE TAX HAVENS PANAMA WAS INCLUDING WAS VERY ANGRY ABOUT IT
BUT IT IS THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CENTRE THAT REFUSED TO ADOPT NEW INTERNATIONAL TRANSPARENCY RULES IN FEBRUARY THEY WERE INTRODUCED BY G. TWENTY COMING TO PLAY NEXT YEAR BELONG WITH BAR RAIN NOW RUBEN A MARTINI THEY HAVEN'T SIGNED UP SO THERE IS A FEELING THAT YOU KNOW HAS PANAMA OR DONE ENOUGH THEN CERTAINLY PANAMA'S PRESIDENT IS SAYING THAT HE'S GOING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS BUT NEVERTHELESS THERE'S STILL AN AWFUL LOT ON COLOUR
HUGE COVERAGE OF THIS IN THE U.K. AND ELSEWHERE I THINK IN EUROPE TO IS THAT THE SAME IN CENTRAL AMERICA
I MEAN HERE IN MEXICO YES THERE IS THERE IS COVERAGE I MEAN ESPECIALLY I MEAN PANAMA IS KNOWN IN THE WORLD BUT IN THE REGION IT'S A HUB FOR THE SORT OF THING AND IT'S ALSO HAD THE REPUTATION IN THE PAST FOR DODGY DEALINGS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS PASSING THEIR MONEY THROUGH PANAMA THAT'S A LOT OF THEIR ALLEGATIONS THEY CERTAINLY IT'S A WELL KNOWN COUNTRY THA PEOPLE HERE BUT
IN PANAMA I THINK THERE IS A CERTAIN FEELING THAT YOU KNOW TOTALLY TO BLAME PANAMA'S NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY TO BE YOU KNOW TO HAVE OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS IN THAT THEN AND HOW IN AND GET WEALTHY CUSTOMERS TO BE PUTTING THEIR MONEY THERE SO I THINK THERE'S A FEELING PERHAPS PANAMA ISN'T ALWAYS ISN'T JUST TO BLAME AND NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN A WIDER ISSUE CERTAINLY PITY WATSON THANK YOU
IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE TIMES LOOKS TO THE FUTURE FOR ITALY THE NEWS THAT LEADING ENTREPRENEURS AND SCIENTISTS HAVE GIVEN THEIR BACKING TO A PROJECT TO SEND A SPACECRAFT TO EXPLORE OUR NEAREST SOLAR SYSTEM TWENTY FIVE TRILLION MILES AWAY THE PAPER DESCRIBES IT AS THE MOST AMBITIOUS SPACE MISSION IN HISTORY
IT SAYS IN A LEADING ARTICLE THAT THE PROJECT'S AUDACITY AND THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE A LITTLE SORT OF INSPIRATIONAL WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF A NEW GOLDEN AGE OF SPACE EXPLORATION AN AGE IN WHICH THE NEXT GREAT LEAPS FOR HUMANKIND A FUNDED NOT BY AMERICAN TAXPAYERS PATEK TYCOONS REARED ON STAR TREK IN THE APOLLO MOON SHOTS ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH MAIN STORY MAJOR TORY DONORS ARE PREPARING TO FUND A GRASS ROOTS CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE FOLLOWING DAVID CAMERON'S DECISION TO SPEND MORE THAN NINE MILLION POUNDS OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY
ON A PRO E.U. LEAFLET IT SAYS THE MIDLAND'S INDUSTRIAL COUNCILLOR GROUP A BUSINESSMAN THAT IS FUNDED THE TORY PARTY FOR TWENTY YEARS ARE PLANNING TO DONATE BETWEEN FOUR AND THE MILLION POUNDS TO THE ANTI Y. YOU CAMPAIGN IT WILL BE SEEN AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDRESS THE BALANCE THE PAPER AT A REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY THAT SAID GANGS ARE ATTEMPTING TO SMUGGLE MIGRANTS INTO THE U.K. THROUGH QUIETER PORTS MAKES THE LEAD FOR THE MALE THE PAPER FOCUSES ON THE REPORT OTHER REVELATIONS THAT THE TRAFFICKERS ARE SMUGGLING MIGRANT ACROSS THE CHANNEL FROM CALAIS
IN THE BACK OF A LORRY FOR ONLY ONE HUNDRED POUNDS HOWEVER THOSE FLYING IN BY AIR WITH FALSE PAPERS MUST PAY THIRTEEN AND A HALF THOUSAND WHILE A SPEED BOAT FROM DUNKIRK IS TWELVE THOUSAND THE NEW DAY LEADS ON A STUDY SUGGESTING THERE'S ALMOST HALF OF DOCTORS IN ENGLAND HAVE CARRIED ON WORKING WAS HIDING CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH ACCORDING TO THE PAPER THEIR RESEARCH BY CARDIFF UNIVERSITY AND THE MORE THAN EIGHTEEN TEN DOCTORS
AND EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS OF MENTAL ILLNESS BUT ONLY FORTY PERCENT HAVE BEEN HONEST ABOUT THEM IT'S THE DEEP RELUCTANCE TO SEEK HELP IS LARGELY DUE TO FEARS THAT COLLEAGUES WOULD FIND OUT OR THAT IT WOULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON THEIR CAREERS AND INTERVENTION BY PRINCE WILLIAM ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH STEEL INDUSTRY DURING HIS VISIT TO INDIA IS WIDELY REPORTED AND HE'S THE LEAD FOR THE MIRROR
IT SAYS THAT HE TACKLED THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER NOR ENDS THE OVER THE PLANS BY TATA STEEL AND INDIAN CONGLOMERATE TO CLOSE IT PUT ALL BUT PLANT THE EXPRESS SAYS THE ISSUE HAS BEEN THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM SO FAR ON THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE'S TOUR BUT THE TIME SAYS MISTER MODI DOESN'T HAVE ANY DIRECT INFLUENCE OVER A DECISION BY A PRIVATE COMPANY AND HASN'T SHOWN ANY INCLINATION TO INTERVENE FINALLY A COUNCIL HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR SPENDING ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ON HIRING CONSULTANTS TO TEACH RESIDENTS HOW TO PREPARE THEIR RUBBISH FOR RECYCLING
ACCORDING TO THE SUN HOUSEHOLDERS IN HULL WHO FAILED TO RINSE THEIR OLD BOTTLES AND TINS PROPERLY FACE HAVING THEIR BLUE RECYCLING BINS CONFISCATED THEY COULD ALSO BE SENT ON AWARENESS COURSES BUT THE COUNCIL TELLS THE TELEGRAPH THAT EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF WET FOOD WASTE CONTAMINATES DRY CARDBOARD SO IT CAN'T BE RECYCLED AND IT ALSO VOIDS THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE BIN SEPARATE
RECYCLING BINS SURELY HAVE TO BE THE ANSWER THAT I WAS A QUARTER TO SEVEN THE MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WETTING DALE HAS BEEN URGED TO WITHDRAW FROM INVOLVEMENT IN PRESS REGULATION IT'S EMERGED THAT FOR NEWSPAPERS INVESTIGATED HIS PAST RELATIONSHIP WITH A SEX WORKER BUT DECIDED NOT TO REVEAL THE DETAILS LEADING TO CLAIMS BY LABOUR AND THE HACKED OFF GROUP THAT HE'S COMPROMISED THE FORMER MANDARIN THE FORMER HEAD OF THE HOME OFFICE OR DAVID NO LINKS AND RODE INTO COMBAT YESTERDAY
WITH AN INTERVIEW IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES THE RECENTLY RETIRED COMMISSIONER FOR PUBLIC APPOINTMENT TOLD THE PAPER THAT SINCE THE GENERAL ELECTION MINISTERS HAD INCREASED THEIR EFFORTS TO GET CONSERVATIVE SYMPATHISERS ON TO PUBLIC BODIES LATER HE TOLD M.P.S HE WASN'T IMPRESSED BY PLANS TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM FOR MAKING SENIOR APPOINTMENTS HE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN
BACK IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THERE WAS A TILT YARD IN THE OLD PALACE OF WHITEHALL FIVE HUNDRED YEARS ON NIGHTS STILL JOUST AT WESTMINSTER BUT THEY WIELD THEIR PEN RATHER THAN THE SWORD AND PREFER GOVERNMENT REVIEWS TO LANCE'S
WHEN SIR DAVID NORMINGTON APPEARED BEFORE THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE HE SAID PROPOSALS FROM SAID GERRY GRIMSTONE TO CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE WERE GIVEN SENIOR JOBS ON PUBLIC BODIES WOULD DISMANTLE THE CURRENT SYSTEM
AN ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THESE ARE MINISTERIAL APPOINTMENTS ARE MINISTERS MUST CHOOSE
SO THAT THERE ISN'T ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT UNDER THE PRESENT SYSTEM ANY SELECTION PANEL ASSESSES THE CANDIDATES AGAINST THE SPECIFICATION FOR THE ROLE
PUTS FORWARD THE ONES IT THINKS A SUIT
AND THEN THE MINISTER MAY CHOOSE
THE PROPOSITIONS I THINK INTERPRETED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS RESPONSE IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE IS AN INTENTION TO ENABLE MINISTERS TO SAY WELL
I KNOW THAT THE COMMITTEE DIDN'T APPROVE THAT PERSON BUT ACTUALLY
WE THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE APPOINTED SIR DAVID WHO WAS THE MOST SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT AT THE HOME OFFICE BEFORE HE BECAME THE APPOINTMENTS COMMISSIONER TOLD THE CONSERVATIVE FORMER CABINET MINISTER CHERYL GUILLAIN THAT MOST MINISTERS WOULD WANT TO APPOINT THE BEST PEOPLE BUT IT WILL INCREASE THE CHANCES THAT PEOPLE
WITH THEIR STRONG POLITICAL ALLEGIANCE WHO ARE POLITICALLY ACTIVE WILL BE FAVOURED BECAUSE OF THAT POLITICAL ACTIVITY RATHER THAN BE COST
THEY ARE GOOD AT THEIR JOB SO THE RISK IT IS THAT THE PROCESS
WE'LL BE GERRY
THAT'S YOUR WORD BUT IF YOU DON'T WEAR THAT THERE WILL BE UNDUE WEIGHT GIVEN TO PEOPLE'S POLITICAL ALLEGIANCE SIR DAVID SAID THERE'D BEEN TUSSLED OVER THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE ADVISORY PANELS THAT OVERSAW THE PROCESS I'VE HAD ATTEMPTS TO PUT
RELATIVES OF MINISTERS AS INDEPENDENT MEMBERS POLITICAL DONOR'S OFFICE
HOLDERS AND SO ON AND MOSTLY I HAVE SEEN THOSE OFF BUT NOT ALWAYS
AND WHAT OF THE OTHER NIGHT IN THIS JOUST WELL SIR GERRY GRIMSTONE THOUGHTS SIR DAVID HAD MISUNDERSTOOD HIS REPORT I FEEL THAT WOMEN EVER THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING HIM APPOINTMENT
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO GO TO THE WEB PAGE OF THE APARTMENT TO SEE THE APPOINTMENT SORT OF UNDER WAY AT ONE MOMENT
THE SELECTION CROWN ALL HE IS
WITH ANY AFFILIATIONS WERE APPROPRIATE FOR GOD
THE CHINE VIEWING PROCESS STARTED AND THE TIME IT'S GOING TO COMPLETE I WANT THIS TO BE MUCH MORE OPEN
SO JERRY WAS ASKED TO CARRY OUT HIS REVIEW BY THE CABINET OFFICE MINISTER MATT HANCOCK WHO SAID THERE WAS A CLEAR PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM CHERYL GUILLAIN WANTED PROOF
IN THE LAST YEAR HOW MANY GOOD PEOPLE IN INVERTED COMMAS
WHAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN PUT OFF AND WITHDRAWN FROM THE PUBLIC APPOINTMENT ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM
THE FORMER POLITICAL JOURNALIST PETER RIDDLE IS THE GOVERNMENT'S PREFERRED CANDIDATE TO BE THE NEXT APPOINTMENT'S COMMISSIONER HE THOUGHT SIR GERRY'S PROPOSALS WOULD CHANGE THE ROLE OF THE JOB I DID YOU WERE VERY MUCH OF A MORE PUBLIC ROLE OR MORE I'D SAY I'M A GOOD MY BACKGROUNDS THAT SIDE I AM I NOT AN INSIDER I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT IN RECOGNISING THAT SOMETIMES I CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE I MAKE DAVID ALTERATION GOOD POINT ON
MAKE WILL BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT EQUALLY A FEW I'M COMFORTABLE NONSENSE IS VERY WELL AS ACT AS A DETERRENT TO UM THERE ARE UNACCEPTABLE
THAT WAS A GENTLEMANLY JUST OVER AT THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE THEY PREFER TO PEEL RATHER THAN SIMPLY PROD THEIR MANDARINS AS A SENIOR OFFICIAL AT THE HOME OFFICE
OLIVER ROBIN'S DISCOVERED WHEN HE COULDN'T ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE LABOUR CHAIR KEITH AS ABOUT THE BUDGET FOR THE U.K. BORDER FORCE IT'S OVER YES OR NO MISTER ROBBINS
I'M AFRAID IF YOU DON'T ANSWER THE QUESTION WE MIGHT HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT EASY TO ANSWER IT'S IN A SIMPLE YES OR NO MISTER SHOWMAN THAT'S ALL THEM SUSAN DOES NOT KNOW
EVENTUALLY MY SHOWED THE SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT THE RED CARD MY ROBINS I NEED TO EXCUSE YOU FROM THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK YOUR YOUR EVIDENCE SO FAR HAS BEEN UNSATISFACTORY
IT'D BEEN A SHORT LIVED DEBUT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE BUT MISTER ROBBINS IS CERTAIN TO RETURN IF ONLY BECAUSE AT THE START OF THE SESSION KEITH VAZ TOLD THE OFFICIAL HE HOPED IT WAS THE FIRST OF MANY APPEARANCES IN FRONT OF THE M.P.S SEAN CURRAN REPORTING IN THERE'S MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST AFTER HOPPER STATE ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO
TIME NOW IS TEN TO SEVEN THE RELEASE OF THE PANAMA PAPERS MEANS THEY WERE ALL BEGINNING TO LEARN JUST HOW BIG HOW POWERFUL THOSE OFFSHORE FUNDS ARE CAMPAIGNERS FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY OF WHO OWNS WHAT ARE NOW CLAIMING THAT LAND IN THE U.K. EQUIVALENT TO THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF GREATER LONDON IS OWNED BY SECRET COMPANIES BASED OFFSHORE TUDO DONE FROM GLOBAL WITNESS ONE OF THOSE CAMPAIGNING ORGANISATIONS CAN TELL US MORE THIS IS A VAST AREA OF LAND
YES IT'S A VERY LARGE AREA A GLOBAL WITNESS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO THE ISSUE OF WHO OWNS PROPERTY IN THE U.K. AND WE FOUND THAT AS YOU SAID AN AREA OF LAND THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF GREATER LONDON IS OWNED OFFSHORE THE REASON WHY THAT'S A PROBLEM AS WE'VE BEEN DOING INVESTIGATIONS AND WE FOUND THAT THE USE OF THESE OFFSHORE COMPANIES TO OWN PROPERTY IN THE U.K.
MEANS THAT CRIMINALS LIKE CORRUPT POLITICIANS TAX EVADERS DRUG SMUGGLERS ARE USING THE U.K. PROPERTY MARKET TO LAUNDER MONEY TO STASH THEIR DIRTY CASH AND THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM AND THE AMOUNT OF LAND SHOWS HOW BIG A PROBLEM IT THERE WAS A STORY WASN'T THERE NOT SO LONG AGO ABOUT A KAZAKHS FIGURE OWNING A LARGE PARTS OF BAKER STREET INCLUDING MANY OF THE TOURIST ATTRACTIONS
CORRECT THAT WAS ONE OF OUR REPORTS RELEASE LAST YEAR GLOBAL WITNESS WE SHOWED THAT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION POUNDS WORTH OF PROPERTY AROUND LONDON'S BAKER STREET AN ICONIC PLACE IS OWNED BY A COLLECTION OF BEADY EYE COMPANIES COMPANIES INCORPORATE THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS OFFSHORE JURISDICTION NOW YOU'RE NOT ARGUING THAT PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO OWN IT BUT YOU ARE ARGUING AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT WE SHOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT WHO IT IS AND HOW WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK FOR THE INFORMATION IT SHOULD SIMPLY BE
ABSOLUTELY THE REAL ISSUE IS IDENTIFIED WHO THE PERSON IS THAT OWNS THE PROPERTY AND WHERE THEIR MONEY CAME FROM AND AT THE MOMENT UNDER THE CURRENT RULES YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO TELL THAT THAT'S A REALLY BIG PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE U.K. EFFECTS HE ALLIED HEWITT AFFECTS LIVES PEOPLE OVERSEAS NEVER HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN THE RULES THERE HASN'T THERE AND WHEN WHICH SOME OF THESE TAX HAVENS HAVE BEEN PERSUADED AFTER PRESSURE NOT JUST FROM LONDON BUT GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD
TO HAVE A REGISTER OF WHO OWNS WHAT THE DEBATE IS DO YOU HAVE TO ASK TO SEE THE REGISTER OR IS IT ACTUALLY AUTOMATICALLY PUBLIC CORRECT THE SITUATION THE TAX HAVENS IS A BIG PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT ALL THAT THEY HAVE AGREED TO DO
IS CREATE THESE PRIVATE REGISTERS HE SENT REGISTERS WHICH WILL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE U.K. TO JOURNALISTS AND THE REASON WHY THAT'S A PROBLEM IS IT MEANS THAT THE MONEY WILL REMAIN HIDDEN FROM A LOT OF EYES AND THE PRIME MINISTER HAS ADMITTED HIMSELF THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC
LET'S IMAGINE HOW YOU MIGHT USE THAT INFORMATION IF IT WERE PUBLIC LET'S SAY OVERNIGHT THEY DO WHAT YOU WANT WE NOW KNOW THAT PART TO BAKER STREET FOR EXAMPLE AROUND BY THAT CASSOCK IT FIGURE THEN WHAT
LISTEN SOME VERY SIMPLE STEP THEY CAN BE TAKEN IF AS YOU SAY THEY'RE PRIME MINISTER WAVES HIS MAGIC WAND WERE ABLE TO SEE WHO REALLY OWNS THESE PROPERTIES PEOPLE LIKE THE POLICE CAN ACTUALLY GO IN AND SEES THESE ASSETS THEY CAN THEN SELL THOSE ASSETS AND RETURN THE MONEY TO THE PEOPLE FROM WHICH THE MONEY WAS STOLEN THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER HERE IS THEIR POPULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE BEING STOLEN FROM BY THE VERY PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING THEM AND THAT MONEY IS BEING FUNNELLED INTO THE U.K. PROPERTY MARKET AND THAT THE PROBLEM SHE DID UM FROM GLOBAL WITNESS THANK YOU JOIN US
THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE WHOLESALE PRICE OF GAS AND ELECTRICITY IN THE U.K. IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL FOR A DECADE NOT WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR HOUSEHOLD BILL THE LATEST ANALYSIS HAS COME FROM I.C.I. S. WHICH PROVIDES INDEPENDENT PRICING INFORMATION ON THE ENERGY MARKET WE'RE JOINED BY ZOE DOUBLE WHO'S THE HEAD OF POWER AT I.C.I. S. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND THIS IS THE CASE FOR BOTH WHOLESALE GAS AND ELECTRICITY IS IT
YES WILL POWERS AT NINE YEAR LOWS AND GAS IS AT ITS LOWEST POINT IN MORE THAN TEN YEARS SO AND HOW MUCH HER HAVE HAS THE WHOLESALE PRICE GONE DOWN IN THE LAST YEAR OVER THE LAST YEAR IT'S IT'S GONE DOWN BY AROUND
A GOODLY PROPORTION AROUND A QUARTER OR SOMETHING RIGHT O.K. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR FOR PEOPLE'S HOUSEHOLD BILLS NO NO IT'S NOT AND THE REASON FOR THAT WELL I THINK
PARTLY THE ENERGY BILLS ARE PARTLY THE WHOLESALE PROPORTION OF THE ENERGY BILL IS ACTUALLY A SMALLER PROPORTION OF THE ENERGY BILL ANYWAY IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT BILL'S GOING FORWARDS AND WHAT WE CAN EXPECT I THINK IT'S ENERGY COMPANIES ARE CUT AND COMING UNDER QUITE A LOT OF PRESSURE I MEAN WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT
IN THE WHOLESALE MARKETS THE MOST LIQUID PART OF THE WHOLESALE MARKET WHERE MOST OF THE VOLUME IS CHANGING HANDS IS ABOUT ONE OR TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE SO WE'VE SEEN SOME PRICE FALL SO FAR AND THAT DATES BACK TO FALSE
ON THE ENERGY MARKETS MAYBE TWO YEARS AGO BUT EVEN IF IT IS A DELAYED REDUCTION THAN PEOPLE MIGHT SEE THERE STILL SEEMS TO BE A BIG GAP BETWEEN THE DROP IN WHOLESALE PRICES AND WHAT PEOPLE'S BILLS HAVE COME DOWN BY WHICH IS ROUGHLY ABOUT FIVE PER CENT ABSOLUTELY AND THIS IS BRINGING THE ENERGY COMPANIES UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE I MEAN IT'S NEVER BEEN EASIER FOR U.K. CONSUMERS TO SWITCH AND IF THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR SUPPLIERS WE HAVE A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET WITH AT LEAST THIRTY COMPANIES COMPETING FOR BUSINESS
I THINK A LOT OF THE GENERATIONS SIDE IS ACTUALLY LESS PROFITABLE AT THE MOMENT AND YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF THE SMALLER SUPPLIERS WHO WANTING ENCUMBERED BY THE GENERATION AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE ABLE TO HAND ON THESE PRICE FALLS VERY QUICKLY AND VERY EASILY SO A LOT OF THE ENERGY COMPANIES ARE UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE
THAT THERE'RE RETAIL TARIFFS ARE THE MOST COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET MIGHT BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE THAT COMPETITIVE WHY IS IT THAT IF YOU LOOK AT ALL SIX OF THE OF THE BIG SUPPLIERS THEY ALL SEEM TO REDUCE THEIR PRICES BY ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT NO ONE SEEMS TO BE SEEKING ABOUT THAT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE ON PRICE
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A QUESTION FOR THE ENERGY COMPANIES BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE ON THE WHOLESALE MARKETS WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE EXACTLY WHO'S TRADING WHAT BUT WE DO SEE THE PRICE MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE MARKET AS A WHOLE AND GOING FORWARD OH WHAT WHERE WHERE HER PRICES LIKE TO GO THERE'S A STORY IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIS MORNING AB QUOTING OIL TRADERS SAYING THAT AS FAR AS OIL PRICES ARE CONCERNED THEY DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BAT GOING TO GO BACK TO THE SORT OF LEVELS THAT WERE SEEN IN JANUARY
I THINK A YET WITH THE WITH THE UM WITH THE MORE STABLE CRUDE PRICE WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN PRICES OVER THE LAST QUARTER THESE WHOLESALE PRICES START START TO STABILISE A LOT MORE WHICH IS
IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THE ENERGY COMPANIES AT THE MOMENT BUT GOING FORWARD FOR DELIVERY TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN WE'RE STILL SEEING PRICES REMAINING LOW BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE MARKET FOR GAS AT LEAST OVER SUPPLY IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON POWER
SO DOUBLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND CHRIS FAWKES IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER MORNING CHRIS THAT'S NICK SOMETHING OF A MOTH'S NORTH SOUTH SPLIT WITH TODAY'S WEATHER ACROSS THE NORTH OF THE U.K. IT'S GOING TO BE CLOUDY WITH SOME PATCHY OUTBREAKS OF RAIN FOR MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES CONVERSELY PLENTY OF MORNING SUNSHINE BUT A FEW AFTERNOON HEAVY SHOWERS START OFF ACROSS SOUTHERN ENGLAND WALES THE MIDLANDS AND EASTERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND

AT THE TIME HE WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE CULTURE MEDIA AND SPORT SELECT COMMITTEE BUT THE FACT THE STORY WASN'T REPORTED HAS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST INVOLVING THE MAN IN CHARGE OF MEDIA REGULATION AND THE MOTIVATION IN NEWSPAPERS IN NOT REPORTING IT
THE PAPERS SAY THEY DID NOT RUN THE STORY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND IN THE STATEMENT MY GIRL SAID IT WAS AN OLD STORY WHICH HAD BEEN A BIT EMBARRASSING BUT IT HAD NO INFLUENCE ON ANY DECISIONS HERE TAKEN AS CULTURE SECRETARY

A GROUP OF LABOUR M.P.S AND ACTIVISTS IS TRYING TO CHANGE THE PARTY'S RULES TO MAKE IT EASIER TO EXPEL ANTI SEMITIC MEMBERS LOCAL CONSTITUENCY PARTIES WILL BE ASKED TO SUPPORT THE MOVE AND SUPPORTERS HOPE IT WILL BE ACCEPTED AT LABOUR'S CONFERENCE IN THE AUTUMN HE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS
FOR MONTHS LABOUR HAS BEEN DOGGED BY A STREAM OF ALLEGATIONS ABOUT ANTI SEMITIC COMMENTS BY ITS MEMBERS MANY WITHIN THE PARTY ARE PROFOUNDLY FRUSTRATED ARGUING THAT WHILE JEREMY CORBIN AND CHERRY CHANCE THERE JOHN MCDONNELL REGULARLY CONDEMN AUNTIE SCIMITARS AND THEY'VE BEEN SLOW TO ACT
NOW A GROUP OF LABOUR M.P.S AND ACTIVISTS ARE LAUNCHING A BID TO REWRITE LABOUR'S RULE BOOK AIMING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TACKLE ANTI SEMITE ISM AND TO BAN PEOPLE FROM THE PARTY FOR LIFE

THE ANIMAL WELFARE CHARITY THE R.S.P.C.A. SAYS THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS HUGELY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON THE DOGS' APPEARANCE RATHER THAN GENETIC HERITAGE IT SAYS THERE'S NO ROBUST EVIDENCE WHICH SHOWS BREED SUCH AS PIT BULL TERRIERS ANY MORE LIKELY TO SHOW AGGRESSION THAN OTHER TYPES OF DOG

THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED SUSAN IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE POLISH PLUMBER HAS FOR YEARS BEEN THE SYMBOL OF SOARING IMMIGRATION HERE FROM WITHIN THE E.U. COULD THEIR PLACE BE TAKEN SOON THERE BY THE PORTUGUESE CARER ON THE SPANISH I.T. WORKER OR THE ITALIAN WRIST AND NEW ANALYSIS OF THE IMMIGRATION STATISTICS CONFIRMS THAT IT IS THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTHERN EUROPE AS MUCH AS EASTERN EUROPE WHO ARE NOW FUELLING THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE U.K.
AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THEY'RE COMING AND TO DO WHAT MATTERS GIVEN THAT IMMIGRATION IS AT THE HEART OF THE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD REMAIN IN OR LEAVE THE E.U.
WE'RE JOINED BY MADELEINE SOME SHIN THE DIRECTOR OF THE MIGRATION OBSERVATORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD WHICH HE'S DONE THIS LATEST ANALYSIS WE'VE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME HAVE WE NOT THAT THE POORER COUNTRIES OF SOUTHERN EUROPE ARE SENDING MORE PEOPLE MORE PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING TO COME FROM THOSE COUNTRIES SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOUR ANALYSIS IS PARTICULARLY DISCOVERED
WE LOOKED AT THE TOP COUNTRIES THAT HAVE DRIVEN THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS LIVING HERE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING WAS THAT ALONGSIDE OF COURSE POLAND AS ONE OF THE TOP COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN WE HAVE THREE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ITALY PORTUGAL AND SPAIN
WHICH COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN HIT QUITE HARD BY THE EUROZONE CRISIS WHERE UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN QUITE HIGH FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT APPEARS TO HAVE DRIVEN A HIGHER LEVEL OF MIGRATION TO THE U.K. CAN YOU PUT NUMBERS ON THERE HOW DO THE NUMBERS COMING FROM THOSE THREE COMPARE BROADLY WITH THE SORT OF NUMBERS WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE COUNTRIES THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT FOR SO LONG NOT JUST POLAND OF COURSE BUT REMAIN YOU AND OTHERS
IF YOU LOOK AT THE GROWTH AND POLAND ROMANIA ARE STILL AT THE TOP THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE COMING FROM POLAND FOR EXAMPLE INGRATE IN WHAT TIME FOR THAT'S BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN THEN AFTER THAT WE HAVE SPAIN WAS THE HIGHEST OF THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING FROM SPAIN ACTUALLY MORE THAN DOUBLED OVER THAT PERIOD THAT INCREASING BY ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND AND THEN WE HAD INCREASES FROM ITALY AND PORTUGAL OF FIFTY THOUSAND OR A LITTLE BULL
IN ONE SENSE DOES THIS NOT TELL US HE HAD A STATEMENT OF THE OBVIOUS THAT WHEN YOU STRUGGLE TO GET A JOB AT HOME WHETHER THAT HOME IS IN SOUTH WALES OR IN CORNWALL IN PARTS OF THE NORTH EAST OR INDEED IN SPAIN OR PORTUGAL OR POLAND OR REMAIN YOU MOVE SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU MIGHT GET A JOB
YES ABSOLUTELY THEIR ECONOMIC DRIVERS OF MIGRATION ARE THOUGHT TO BE IMPORTANT A MAJORITY OF E.U. CITIZENS WHO ARE COMING TO THE U.K. AT REPORT THAT THEY'RE COMING FOR WORK IT'S IT'S NOT THE ONLY FACTOR PEOPLE ALSO COME FOR FAMILY REASONS AS SOME PEOPLE COME HERE FOR STUDY PEOPLE MAY COME PARTLY FOR ECONOMIC REASONS BUT ALSO BE PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE U.K. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE SPEAK ENGLISH HERE AND SO THEY MAY WANT TO LEARN ENGLISH OR ALREADY HAVE LEARNT AT SCHOOL SO THAT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THEM
I THINK PEOPLE WILL BE INTRIGUED BY HOW YOU SEPARATE OUT THOSE FACTORS CAUSE MIGRATION OBSERVATORIES OFTEN QUOTED LET'S BE HONEST IT'S OFTEN QUOTED BY PEOPLE ARE IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THE E.U. AND IN FAVOUR OF IMMIGRATION FROM WITHIN THE E.U. TO HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY KNOW WHETHER SOMEONE IS PRIMARILY COMING FOR A JOB OR BECAUSE OF THE TOP UP BENEFITS OR BECAUSE THEY SPEAK ENGLISH OTHER THAN ASKING THEM AND THEY MIGHT NOT GIVE YOU PARTICULARLY ACCURATE ANSWER
YES WHAT IN INDIVIDUAL CASES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT HAVE THE REAL MOTIVATION IT WOULD OR SOMEONE ACTUALLY THINKING WHEN THEY DECIDE TO MOVE THERE HAS BEEN WRISTS UP SOME RESEARCH THAT LOOKS AT BROAD TREND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WAGES GO UP IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY DOES THAT IS THAT ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF MIGRATION IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING I'D BENEFIT I MEAN THIS HAS BEEN A BIG QUESTION RECENTLY WHERE THE PEOPLE FACTOR IN BENEFITS NOW SO IF YOU LOOK AT IN WORK BENEFITS WHICH TOP UP PEOPLE'S WAGES
IN THEORY IT'S PLAUSIBLE THAT THEY COULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THEY DECIDE WHETHER TO MOVE BECAUSE IT MAKES IT MORE FINANCIALLY ATTRACTIVE TO COME TO THE U.K. AND THE QUESTION THEN IS JUST ONE HOW MANY PEOPLE MIGHT BE MAKING THE DECISION ON THIS BASIS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS THE STATISTICS AREN'T PERFECT ON THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE USING IN WORK BENEFITS BUT ALL OF THE STATISTICS SUGGEST THAT THE LARGE MAJORITY OF NOT TAKING THE BENEFITS WHICH SUGGEST THAT IT'S NOT THE MAJOR DRIVING FACTOR MADELEINE SOME CARRETERA MIGRATION OBSERVATORY THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE WAS ANOTHER ALLEGATION OF ANTI SENATORS IN THE LABOUR PARTY THIS WEEK THIS TIME RESULTING IN THE SUSPENSION OF A COUNSELLOR IN LUTON THE PARTY'S BEEN DOGGED BY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT IS DOING ENOUGH ABOUT ANTI CEMETERIES AND WITHIN THE RANKS AND NOW A GROUP OF M.P.S AND ACTIVISTS WANT TO CHANGE THE RULES TO MAKE IT EASIER TO BAN THOSE ACCUSED OF IT FOR LIFE
OUR REPORTER ROSS HAWKINS IS HERE WITH MORE ON THIS HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM IS THIS BECOMING FOR THE PARTY BOSS THERE REALLY IS A PRETTY PROFOUND FRUSTRATION WITHIN THE LABOUR MOVEMENT ABOUT THIS STREAM OF STORIES PARTLY BECAUSE THEY'D FOLLOW THIS PATTERN OF EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE JUST TOLD US WE HEAR AN ALLEGATION OF ANTI SEMITE ISN'T SOMEONE IS SUSPENDED WE ARE REMINDED THAT THE PARTY ITS LEADERS ABHOR ANTI SEMITE ISM AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THERE'S ANOTHER VERY SIMILAR CASE
AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PUSHING THE ARGUMENT FOR A CHANGE IN THE RULES SAY THIS SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM SIMPLY ISN'T WORKING WE HAVE CASES WHERE PEOPLE ARE SUSPENDED ONE PERSON ALLOWED BACK IN AND THEN SUSPENDED AGAIN JEREMY KNEW MARK RUNS THE JEWISH LABOUR MOVEMENT
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT ZERO TOLERANCE OF ANTI SEMITES ISM BUT IT'S BECOME APPARENT BECAUSE OF A SPATE OF INCIDENTS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS THAT THE RULES AND PROCESSES OF THE PARTY DON'T PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROVISION
TO DEAL WITH IT SO HE'S HELPED DRAW UP A PROPOSED RULE CHANGE NOW THIS EXPLICITLY BANS ANTI SEMITIC ISLAMOPHOBIC OR RACIST LANGUAGE AND THE HOPE IS THE LOCAL PARTIES WHICH CAN PROPOSE RULE CHANGES FORMALLY WITHIN LABOUR'S STRUCTURED VOTE FOR THIS THAT THE ANY LABOUR'S RULE THE COMMITTEE TAKES IT ON AND YOU COULD SEE A CHANGE AT THE PARTY CONFERENCE
AND WHAT'S CRUCIAL HERE IS THAT THE MESSAGE IS CAREFULLY CRAFTED THEY'RE NOT SAYING THAT THE LEADERSHIP HAS GOT THIS ALL WRONG THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THEY NEED TO GET A GRIP THERE SAYING THAT JOHN MACDONALD THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID ANTI SEMITE SHOULD BE THROWN OUT OF THE PARTY FOR LIFE BUT THEY NEED TO TURN THOSE WORDS THAT IDEA INTO A PRACTICAL REALITY WITHIN LABOUR'S RULE BOOK THE LABOUR M.P. WHERE'S STR EATING IS ONE OF THOSE HE'S GOING TO PUT THIS TO HIS LOCAL PARTY
WE'VE NOW GOT A PROBLEM WHERE TOO MANY OF OUR JEWISH MEMBERS AND PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY THINK THAT THE LABOUR PARTY IS APATHETIC TIME TO SUMMIT ISM AND IT ISN'T THE PLACE FOR JEWISH MEMBERS AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PARTY WITH ITS HISTORIC COMMITMENT TO TACKLING ALL FORMS OF PREJUDICE INCLUDING AND SCIMITARS AND IS STILL A PLACE FOR JEWISH PEOPLE
RUSS YOU MUCK TALKING A MOMENT AGO ABOUT THERE BEING THE SPATE OF INCIDENTS WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS HOW DOES ALL OF THIS CORRESPOND TO THE FAULT LINES WITHIN THE PARTY SINCE JEREMY CORBIN BECAME THE LEADER THE TWO THINGS ARE PRETTY CLOSELY LINK CERTAINLY IN PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION AND SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE PROPOSING THIS AND I KNOW THAT SUPPORTERS INCLUDE PRIVATE THE ELISE ONE SHADOW MINISTER
ARE AWARE THAT THE CHARGE WILL BE MADE THAT THIS ISSUE IS USED AS A STICK TO BEAT JEREMY CORBIN WIDER DEBATES THAT AREN'T TO DO WITH ANTI SENATORS AND THEY'RE TO DO WITH JEREMY CORBIN IS AND WHERE THE LABOUR PARTY AS WE HAVE HEARD PLENTY OF TIMES BEFORE A PARTY RULE BOOKS BEING USER SORT OF FACTIONAL BATTLEGROUND WHAT HE'S TELLING THOUGH IS THE PARTY'S FORMAL STATEMENT RESPONDING TO THIS WELCOME TO THE CONTRIBUTION
WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES GENERAL A THE LABOUR PEER IS INVESTIGATING SEVERAL APPLICATIONS OF ANTI SEMITIC SHE WILL REPORT ON THAT AT LEAST GIVE AN UPDATE TO THE ANY C. IN THE SUMMER AND SHE WILL IN THE END MEN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS MAY WELL INCLUDE CHANGING THE RULES SO I THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF WHEN NOT WHETHER SOME SORT OF FORMAL CHANGE HAPPENS OF COURSE WHAT WE CAN'T THEY WILL ONLY IF THIS IS HOW MUCH DAMAGE IS BEING DONE WHILE ALL THIS GOES ONTO THE LABOUR'S REPUTATION WERE YOU HEAR STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE
PRAISING HIT THE OR INTIMIDATING JEWISH MEMBERS AND WE ALSO FRANK YOU CAN'T BE SURE WHERE THE REWRITING THE RULE BOOK WILL HAVE ANY IMPACT ON WHAT PEOPLE SAY OR TWEET AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT I THINK AND WHAT THEY FEEL RUSSELL KENT'S THANK YOU
IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ROBBIE IS HERE WITH A BUSINESS NEWS AND TESCO HAVE PRODUCED THEIR RESULTS THEY HAVE HAD A TERRIBLE FEW YEARS A YEAR AGO AT PACE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSSES IN U.K. CORPORATE HISTORY BUT OUR BIGGEST SUPERMARKET HAS JUST SAID IT HAS RETURNED TO A FULL YEAR PROFIT MAKING ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION POUNDS OVER THE PAST YEAR THERE ARE OTHER SIGNS IT'S TURN AROUND
IS BEGINNING TO TAKE PLACE LIKE FOR LIKE SALES INCREASE ALMOST ONE PER CENT IN THE U.K. IN THE FINAL THREE MONTHS OF ITS FINANCIAL YEAR THAT MAY NOT SOUND MUCH BUT THAT'S THE FIRST TIME IT SEEMED SUCH GROWTH FOR THREE YEARS WELL WITH US IS NICK HOOD A BUSINESS RISK ADVISER AT OPUS RESTRUCTURING GOOD MORNING TO YOU NICK WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF TESCO'S RESULTS I THINK AND AN IMPRESSIVE START TO THE TURNAROUND BUT WHAT EVERYBODY HAS TO REMEMBER IS THIS IS A HUGE BUSINESS AND
TURN AROUND TEND TO GET THE EASY WINS EARLY AND IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE MEANING FOR ME SEE WHERE THIS IS SUPERTANKER IS IN ANOTHER YEAR'S TIME TESCO ANOTHER BIG SUPERMARKETS HAVE OF COURSE BEEN BATTERED BY THE SUPERMARKET PRICE WAR PRESUMABLY THAT IS NOT YET OVER AND BY NO BY NO MEANS ALDI AND LIDL ARE STILL TAKING MARKET SHARE THEIR LATEST CANTAR RESULTS SHOWED THAT TESCO WERE WERE DOING BETTER BUT ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING BACKWARDS AS FAST AS THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY
THE TESCO BOSS DAVE LEWIS HE SAID THIS MORNING THAT THEY HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM OR WAS HE PERHAPS OVER HYPING IT LITTLE I DO THESE OVER HYPING IT I MEAN THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TO DO HERE LOTS OF PERIPHERAL BUSINESSES WHICH THEY'RE NOW SELLING LOTS OF HER PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY THE U.K. STORES WERE RUN AND THAT'S THE NUB OF ANOTHER PROBLEM HERE YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF A BUSINESS LIKE
AT TESCO TO GET TO GET BETTER RESULTS AND THIS IS A BUSINESS IN THE U.K. WITH THREE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND START OFF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN A HURRY IT'S BEEN LOSING MARKET SHARE AND TESCO SAID THIS MORNING THAT THE MARKET REMAINED
CHALLENGING DEFLATION AND UNCERTAIN SO WHAT ELSE DOES IT HAVE TO DO TO WIN BACK CUSTOMERS WHO'VE LEFT IT BUT IT AT THE PRICE CUTTING HELPS BUT IT HELPS THE THE CONSUMER BUT IT DOESN'T HELP THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE BUSINESS AND ONE OF THE REALLY BIG QUESTIONS IS WHETHER THE U.K. CORE BUSINESS OF TESCO CAN MAKE MONEY AND WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO TO ACHIEVE THAT A LOT OF HARD WORK A BERRY MIGHT ALSO IT'S HOBBLED BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WITH ITS SUPPLIERS
AND THE S.F.O. INVESTIGATION MEANS IT CANNOT BE AS TOUGH WITH ITS SUPPLIERS AS TYPICALLY IT WOULD LIKE TO BE AND IT CAN STILL SQUEEZE THEM BUT IT'S MUCH HARDER TO GET THOSE REALLY GOOD MARGINS O. KAY THANK YOU NICK NICK HAD THEIR BUSINESS RISK ADVISER OPUS RESTRUCTURE
THROUGHOUT THE TIME IS TWENTY PAST SEVEN SOMETHING RATHER ASTONISHING IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD OF BIG FARMER WHEN IT COMES TO GENE EDITING THERE IS AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF COLLABORATION THE SHARING OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT A TECHNOLOGY WITH THE POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONISE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH A SCIENCE EDITOR TOM FIELD AND REPORTS SO WE'RE GONNA START IN ON SOMEONE
EXAMPLE GONNA USE TODAY IS THE AGEING IN A LECTURE THEATRE IN FUTURE CENTRE AT HOMERTON COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE DOCTOR MARK THOMAS IS TAKING A CLASS THROUGH THE BASICS OF CRISP AT CAT'S NICE GENE EDITING IF I'M GOING TOO FAST JUST LET ME KNOW OR RAISE A HAND
AND GO BACK THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS TO BE INTERACTIVE AND FOLLOW ALONG SO FAR SO REMARKABLE
THOMAS HE'S NOT THE CAMBRIDGE DON HE'S ONE OF THE LEADING COMPUTER BIOLOGISTS AT THE WELLCOME TRUST SANGHA INSTITUTE AND HIS STUDENTS FOLLOWING ALONG ON THEIR LAPTOPS AND TABLETS I'M NOT UNDERGRADUATES OR EVEN POST DOCS BUT FULLY FLEDGED RESEARCH SCIENTISTS WILL BE TAKING THE KNOWLEDGE THEY GAIN FROM THIS INTENSIVE TECHNICAL TWO DAY WORKSHOP BANG TO RIVAL UNIVERSITIES AND INSTITUTES EVEN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES
ACROSS EUROPE SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE COME BY SCIENCE INTENSIVE WORKSHOPS TO BRING IS BEHIND THIS SUDDEN BURST OF TRUISM IS CAM BIOSCIENCES DOCTOR CHIP BAISER AQUEDUCT TO COME AND LEARN ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY QUICKLY AND INTENSELY FROM PEOPLE WHO REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AS A TECHNOLOGY IS DEVELOPING BECAUSE IT'S SO CUTTING EDGE THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING VERY RAPIDLY AND YOU REALLY NEED TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINE ABOUT HOW TO EMPLOY THIS TECHNOLOGY PROPERLY AND SAFELY
BUT YOU'RE ALSO DOING IT FOR THE GREATER GOOD ABSOLUTELY SO I DON'T THINK THAT IS FULLY APPRECIATED YET QUITE THE SCALE OF WHAT WE CAN DO WE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE GRIP OF A GENE AND ENGINEERING REVOLUTION AND WE SHOULD TRY TO FOCUS ON MAKING THE MOST OF THIS TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE WE THINK THAT SOCIETY AS A WHOLE IS GOING TO BENEFIT FROM
IT'S REALLY FOR ME BEING A P.H.D. STUDENT AGAIN BUT IF IT COMES AS NO GREAT SURPRISE TO FIND A CAMBRIDGE ENTREPRENEUR AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST MEDICAL RESEARCH CHARITY TEAMING UP TO CHAMPION THE PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
IT'S A MOTHER THING ALTOGETHER TO FIND ONE OF THE LEADING FIGURES IN BIG FARMERS DRIVE TO HARNESS THE POTENTIAL OF CRISP GENE EDITING LEADING THE CHARM CHART IT BASICALLY HAD A SURPRISE
ALMOST EVERY MORNING DOCTOR BARRY ROSEN IS THE SENIOR PRINCIPAL SCIENTIST TO TEST RESENT KNICKERS DISCOVERY SCIENCE LABORATORIES ACROSS THE CITY AND WAS THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT THE HOMERTON COLLEGE CONFERENCE OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND
HOW DID TURN GENES ON AND OFF HOW DO YOU CORRECT MUTATIONS HOW TO TILL THE ELEMENTS WHICH ARE CAUSING DISEASE IN THE GENOME OPENS UP A LOT OF EXCITEMENT FOR THE FUTURE AND I THINK REALLY SHOULD REALLY OPEN OUR VISION YOU'RE BOTH AS A SOCIETY AND IN THE INDUSTRY AS WELL
NOW HAVING THESE NEED TOOLS I THINK IT SHOULD GIVE US A LOT OF HOPE FOR THE FUTURE SHARING THOSE TOOLS SHOULD HELP TO ENSURE THE HUGE POTENTIAL OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS DEVELOPED TO GREATEST EFFECT
BUT BEFORE WE GET TOO CARRIED AWAY ASTRA ZENICK AS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT MANY BUNGALOWS SUGGESTS INITIALLY AT LEAST THAT'LL MAINLY HELP BUILD A BETTER BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE
TODAY THE WAY WE WERE USING CRISPER AND GENE EDITING IS RUDE TO INTERROGATE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE SO DRAMATIC BE SPEEDING UP OUR ABILITY TO QUESTION AND UNDERSTAND BIOLOGY AND FROM THAT PIG BETTER TARGETS BETTER PATHWAYS FIRST TO WORK ON
TO TRY AND DELIVER THE NEXT GENERATION OF MEDICINES YOU GET IF YOU LOSE ONE SO THAT ASTRA SENECA STANDS TO GAIN AS MUCH AS ANYONE FROM THE OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE
BUT OF COURSE THE COMPANY WILL BE WELL PLACED IF ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS HERE COMES UP WITH A NOVEL DRUG TARGET THAT NEEDS THE HELP OF THE MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL CONGLOMERATE
BUT IT DOES PROMISE OF JANE'S EDITING HAS AT LEAST HELP TO LOOSEN THE NORMAL RULES
THE DRUG DEVELOPMENT GAME NOW THE T.G.I. BROWSERS ARE COMPATIBLE
THAT WAS TOM FIELDER REPORT HE IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND ROBBIE'S HERE WITH THE SPORTS NEWS WHAT MORNING NICK HERE SARAH HELLO A MANCHESTER CITY'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTER FINALS HAS RESULTED IN HER FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE SEMIS SO YOU MAY HAVE MISSED A PENALTY BUT THEY STILL BEAT PARIS SOUNDS WONDERFUL LAST NIGHT THE GIRL FROM KEVIN THERE BRIAN

I THINK IT'S A VERY TOUCHING FOR THE GLOVE NOT ON IT WILL BE IN THEIR SEMI FINAL YOU HAVE TO BE IN THIS FOR OUR TEAMS
THE FAILURE OF THE BLUE I DON'T LEAVE THE CLUB AT THE END OF THIS ISN'T FOR ME IS THE SECULAR SAYING HE'D DIE SUCH A MEMORY COURSE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE ONE WE HAVE HAPPENING IF IT'S THAT MARK OATEN IS THE INDEPENDENTS CHIEF FOOTBALL CORRESPONDENT MARK HIERARCHY SEEMS IRONIC THAT PELLEGRINI SHOULD BE ACHIEVING THAT PREVIOUSLY ELUSIVE PLACE IN THE CHAMPION'S LEAGUE LAST FOUR MAYBE EVEN MORE WHO KNOWS JUST WHEN HE'S BEEN REJECTED IN FAVOUR OF PEP GUARDIOLA
I THINK IT MAY HAVE KIND OF AFFECTED IS HIS TEAM SELECTION PLANT AS WELL I THINK LAST NIGHT WAS A BIG RONNIE HE WAS BOWLED BY NOT PICKING IT'S A COMPANY PEOPLE OR RISK HIS FITNESS AND COLOUR
SORRY ON THE BENCH WHICH PREVIOUSLY HASN'T DONE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE HE'S BEEN GIVEN YOU YOU BOLD CANNON APPROACHED BY THE FACT THAT HE'S LEAVING PUTS THE NOISE HE COULD ACTUALLY COPE UP OF THAT IN THE SEMI FINAL THE HORN AND HOW IRONIC THAT WOULD BE
IT WILL BE CITY NEEDS TO WIN TO STAY IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE NEXT SEASON I THINK THE BILL CAME UP UPFRONT BUT HOWEVER THE SEMI FINALS IT COULD BE BARCELONA BANK MUNICH RUMP CRED
IT'LL BE TOOK A CITY REALLY SERIOUSLY EQUIPPED TO WIN THE CHAMPION THEY DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO SAY THEY ARE THE OUTSIDERS BUT WE SAW A LIVERPOOL IT'S INVESTMENT FIVE CHELSEA TWENTY TWELVE IF THE TEAM CAN GET IN A BIT FAULTS YOU KNOW A GOOD DRAWER IS POSSIBLE AND THEY'VE GOT SOME WORLD CLASS PLAYERS YOU DOCUMENT IT RON SAID YOU'LL GO ON A JOB ARE THEY GOT THE PLACE TO DO IT
IT'S WHETHER THEY HAVE THE FORTUNE THERE SO CLOSE NEXT CERTAINLY POSSIBLE YES MEANWHILE OF COURSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER EYE ON THEIR OWN DOMESTIC AGENDA AS YOU JUST MENTIONED IT SECURING THE TOP FOUR PLAYS IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE AT THEY'VE GOT DECENT ADVANTAGE IN A MINUTE OVER OF MANCHESTER UNITED BUT NOTHING UNITED UP TO DECENT HOME GAMES COMING UP SINCE YOU'VE GOT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CHAMP IS ME
CITY COULD SLIP OUT OF THE TOP FOUR BUT I THINK IT'S UNLIKELY THE MINUTE THEY DID THEM HE'D HAVE TO IN THE LET'S GO WHOAH LEXI YES THE NEIGHBOURS UNITED HAVE THE SAME ISSUES IN TERMS OF THE DOMESTIC AGENDA BUT ALSO AN F.A. CUP REPLAY THIS EVENING AT WEST HAM AT WAYNE ROONEY IS BACK IN THE SQUAD AFTER A RUN OUT IN THE UNDER TWENTY ONES ON MONDAY EVENING YOU WERE THERE HOW DID HE LOOK

O.K. THAT'S IT LET'S DO SOME RACING TIPS THE NEWMARKET THREE FIFTY FIVE NUMBER SIX SCRUTINEER CHELTENHAM THREE THIRTY FIVE THEM BEFORE JOHN SPIRIT ROB THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON MONDAY MORNING ROMESH AND DAVE GET BACK BEHIND THE COUNTER
I DON'T BUT IT WAS THE FAGS MEGAN BAGS HOOD BANK COLLECTION POINT BUT MALCOLM WAS PUD
BAGS MAGS AND BAGS RETURNS SERVING THE COMMUNITY OVER THE COUNTER HAVE YOU NO FISH FINGERS WITH ARABIC WRITING ON THEM I CAN'T READ ARABIC AM MY SUPPOSED TO COOK UM OH COME OFF
FIRST FINGER PRACTICALLY COOKS ITSELF ON THE ONE THAT BAGS BAGS AND BAGS ON MONDAY MORNING AT HALF PAST ELEVEN ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR I AM OVER THE MOON BOAT SPEED LIMIT FOUNTAIN MODE
LOOK AT THE WEATHER OCCASIONAL RAIN IN THE NORTH SUNSHINE AND SCATTERED SHOWERS IN THE SOUTH YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND MICHELLE WHO'S SANE IT IS TWENTY NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND SUSAN RAY HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN BRIDGING DALE HAS INSISTED THAT NONE OF HIS DECISIONS ON PRESS REGULATION WERE INFLUENCED BY NEWSPAPER INVESTIGATIONS INTO HIS PAST RELATIONSHIP WITH A SEX WORKER
THE RELATIONSHIP ENDED IN FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN BEFORE HE JOINED THE CABINET FOR PAPERS LEARNED ABOUT THEIR LIAISON BUT MADE THE DECISION NOT TO PUBLISH THE STORY CLAIMING THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST LABOUR'S CHRIS BRYANT SAID IT SEEMED THAT THE PAPERS HAD BEEN HOLDING A SWORD OF DAMOCLES OVER THE MINISTER'S HEAD HE HE'D BEEN INVOLVED IN PRESS REGULATION AND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE ROLE THE CAMPAIGN GROUP HACKED OFF SAID MY WEDDING DOES CREDIBILITY HAD BEEN DAMAGED
WITHIN THE PAST HALF HOUR TESCO HAS REPORTED PRE TAX PROFITS OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION POUNDS FOR THE YEAR TO FEBRUARY THAT COMPARES WITH LOSSES OF SIX POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS THE PREVIOUS YEAR THE SUPERMARKET SAYS ITS QUARTERLY SALES GREW IN THE U.K. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS
RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN YOUNG SOUTHERN EUROPEANS MOVING TO THE U.K. TO ESCAPE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT OXFORD UNIVERSITY'S MIGRATION OBSERVATORY SAYS PEOPLE FROM SPAIN PORTUGAL AND ITALY ACCOUNT FOR A QUARTER OF Y. U. ARRIVAL SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN
A GROUP OF LABOUR M.P.S AND ACTIVISTS IS TRYING TO CHANGE THE PARTY'S RULES TO MAKE IT EASIER TO EXPEL ANTI SEMITIC MEMBERS THE PROPOSED CHANGE WILL BE VOTED ON BY LOCAL CONSTITUENCY PARTIES AND SUPPORTERS HOPE THAT WILL THEN BE ACCEPTED AT LABOUR'S AUTUMN CONFERENCE
CANCER RESEARCH U.K. HAS WARNED THAT OBESITY IS LIKELY TO BE TO BLAME FOR A SHARP RISE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES OF WOMB CANCER CHARITY SAYS ABOUT A THIRD OF CASES ARE LINKED TO WOMEN BEING OVERWEIGHT IT'S THOUGHT THAT EXTRA BODY FAT INCREASES THE RISK OF CANCER BY PRODUCING HORMONES WHICH ENCOURAGE CELLS TO DIVIDE
A REPORT INTO A WOMEN'S PRISON IN WEST LONDON HAS REVEALED THAT SOME INMATES WERE GIVEN TENTS AND SLEEPING BAGS WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED BECAUSE THEY HAD NOWHERE TO LIVE INSPECTORS VISITING H.M.P. BRONZE FIELD SAID THAT FACTORS SUCH AS A LACK OF AVAILABLE HOUSING IN THE AREA WERE CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROBLEM
THANK YOU SUSAN IT'S TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT A MINISTER HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN WHO TURNED OUT TO HAVE BEEN A SEX WORKER NOW THAT YOU MIGHT THINK WOULD BE A STORY MANY PAPERS WOULD LOVE TO PRINT BUT NONE DID DESPITE HAVING KNOWN ABOUT IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME WAS THAT BECAUSE THE MINISTER IN QUESTION IS NOW THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WERE TYNDALE RESPONSIBLE OF COURSE FOR THE REGULATION OF THE PRESS AND BEFORE THAT WAS THE CHAIR OF THE INFLUENTIAL COMMITTEE WHICH SCRUTINISE THAT DEPARTMENT
WAS IT FOR ANOTHER REASON BECAUSE HE WAS A SINGLE MAN HE WAS NOT A MINISTER AT THE TIME HE DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS A SEX WORKER HE ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP WHAT HE DID AND SO THERE IS NO PUBLIC INTEREST IN WHO HE DID
OR DID NOT DATE TO DISCUSS THAT WE'RE JOINED BY DOCTOR EVAN HARRIS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HACKED OFF THE PRESSURE GROUP CAMPAIGNS FOR TOUGHER PRESS REGULATION AND NEIL WALLIS FORMER DEPUTY EDITOR OF THE NEWS THE WORLD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GENTS LET'S START WITH EVAN HARRIS FIRST OF ALL
YOU ARE THE SAME EVAN HARRIS WHO WAS SPENT TWO YEARS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE PRESS NOT TO INTRUDE IN PEOPLE'S PRIVATE LIVES IT SEEMS TO BE YOU KNOW D'YOU WANT INTRUSION IN PRIVATE LIVES NO WHAT WE WANT IS HONESTY AND POLITICS SO IF THERE'S A PUBLIC INTEREST JUSTIFICATION FOR PUBLISHING A STORY AND THE SENIOR BROADSHEET CORRESPONDENT AT THE INDEPENDENT FORMER GYM ACOUSTIC IDENTIFIED FOUR
REASONS THAT HE TOOK TO HIS EDITOR INCLUDING AN EXPENSES MATTER INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE LECTURED IN PUBLIC MAX MOSLEY IN THIS IN THIS SELECT COMMITTEE SAYING YOU WERE CRAZY MAX MOSLEY TO CARRY ON IN THIS WAY COS THE PRESS ARE BOUND TO PUBLISH IT SO YOU ARE RECKLESS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS WHY IT COULD HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BUT THE KEY POINT IS THAT LET'S JUST BEFORE YOU DO KEEP ON LET'S DO THE RATIONALE FOR THE STORY AND I PROMISE YOU'LL COME TO WHY YOU THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT
HYPOCRISY IS BASICALLY A SUMMARY OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHICH IS YOU'RE ALLOWED TO PUBLISH STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE HYPOCRITICAL IN WHAT THEY SAY IN PUBLIC BUT DO IN PRIVATE IS IT REALLY THE VIEW OF HACKED OFF THE TABLOID NEWSPAPERS FROM NOW ON IF WE REGARD
SUBJECTIVELY AS A BIT OF A HYPOCRITE WE'RE ENTITLED TO SPLASH YOUR PRIVATE LIFE ALL OVER THE PAPER THAT HAS TO BE BASED ON OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR THE PUBLIC INTEREST JOURNALISM INCLUDES WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICIANS AND THOSE VOTING ON WHAT THE LAW SHOULD BE SHOULD NOT DO ONE THING
IN RESPECT OF CRIMINALISING ACTIVITY SUCH AS DRUGS OR GAY SEX AND YET BE DOING IT THEMSELVES SO YOU WILL NEVER FIND US EVER HAVING SAID THAT THAT WAS ILLEGITIMATE LIMITED VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE OF HYPOCRISY
AS I SAY HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT HE LECTURED MAX MOSLEY AND IN ADDITION IT'S IN THE ARTICLE AND IT'S A IT'S A CLEAR SOME ALLEGATION THAT HE TOOK THIS WOMAN ANA TRIP PAID FOR BY A MEDIA COMPANY AT THE TIME WHEN HE WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE
TO AMSTERDAM WITH PAID FOR BY THE COMPANY AND THE HOTEL AND DIDN'T DECLARE IT MAY HAVE BEEN BELOW THE THRESHOLD BUT THE ADVICES WHEN YOU SIT ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND YOU'RE CHAIRING IT IF IN DOUBT TO CLEAR OUT AND HE WILL IF YOU WANT TO DO I DON'T KNOW LET'S BE CLEAR BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL THERE WAS NO DOUBT IT TO THIS EXTENT HE WAS NOT OBLIGED BY THE RULES TO DECLARE IT WE DON'T KNOW THAT SO WE'VE GOT A SUBJECTIVE VIEW ABOUT HYPOCRISY AND WE'VE GOT A SUBJECTIVE VIEW ABOUT WHETHER HE MAY HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS WISE TO DECLARE THE MONEY
SO THAT THE POINT THAT THE
SENIOR BROADSHEET NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT MAKES IS THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT TABLOID EDITORS DON'T EVEN NEED A SINGLE PUBLIC INTEREST JUSTIFICATION SUBJECTIVE OR OTHERWISE TO RUN THESE SORT OF STORIES WHICH WE DISAPPROVE UP EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SEVERAL PUBLIC INTEREST JUSTIFICATIONS WHICH THEIR LAWYERS WOULD HAVE TOLD THEM WAS O.K.
THEY DIDN'T RUN IT WHEN THERE'S A JUDGE SAYING THERE'S NO PUBLIC INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING THE THREESOME THEIR CELEBRITY THREE SOMEWHERE THERE'S AN INJUNCTION SO WHY DID THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MAIL DEMANDING THE RIGHT TO PUBLISH IT DESPITE A JUDGE SAYING THERE'S NO PUBLIC HAD TO BE THERE I CUT YOU OFF IN ORDER TO TRY AND GO THROUGH THE STORY YOU THINK IT MATTERS FOR A MUCH BIGGER REASON WHY BECAUSE THE POINT IS THE TWO QUESTIONS HE HASN'T ANSWERED
BUT THIS THREE QUESTIONS ONE WAS THERE WAS HE CONTACTED BY THE PRESS I SAY TO DOES HE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE STORY THAT THEY COULD HAVE RUN IF SO DID HE TELL THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CABINET SECRETARY THAT EVEN IF HE'S NOT GOING TO HAVE HIS DECISIONS AFFECTED
THERE MIGHT BE THAT APPEARANCE OR HE WANTS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND THIRDLY WHY HAS JOHN WE TYNDALE REVERSED HIS POSITION AND THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION ON AT LEAST TWO AREAS
LEVISON PART TWO WHERE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BEFORE THIS HE CALLED FOR IT TO TAKE PLACE WHICH IS THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE COVER UP A SERIOUS MATTER WHICH SHOULD THINK NEWSPAPERS WOULD DEMAND THIS IS THE POLICE AND PRESS AND POLITICAL COVER UP IS THE SECOND PART OF THAT HACKING ENQUIRY EXACTLY WHICH WAS ALL COULD NEVER TAKE PLACE TO THE PROSECUTOR OVER AND SECONDLY WHY HAS HE FAILED TO IMPLEMENT WHAT PARLIAMENT PASSED WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER PROMISED WHICH IS THIS SO CALLED COST INCENTIVES
PENALTIES AND BENEFITS FOR NEWSPAPERS WHO OPPOSE OR AGREE WITH GOING INTO THE LEVERSON SYSTEM I WILL COME BACK TO YOU I JUST WANT TO BRING IN NEIL WALLIS WHO WAS DEPUTY EDITOR OF THE NEWS THERE WELL BEFORE THAT EDITOR OF THE PEOPLE WE BEGIN WITH THE STORY NO WALLET AND THEN LET'S GO ON TO THE ALLEGED CONFLICT OF INTEREST IF SOMEONE HER COME TO YOU AS A TABLOID EDITOR AND SAID I'VE GOT THIS TORY POLITICIAN IS NOW A MINISTER HE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN WHO TURNS OUT TO BE IN A DOMINATRIX HE WOULD HAVE SAID GREAT WOULDN'T IT

JOINING HANDS WITH HACKED OFF FOR YEARS YOU'VE BEEN TRYING CAMPAIGNING AGAINST NEWSPAPERS QUOTE BREACHING PRIVACY
YOU HAVE HACKED OFF SOME NUT JOB CONSPIRACY THEORY WEBSITE AND THE B.B.C. ALL GOING TOGETHER TO ATTACK THE PRESS FOR NOT REVEALING THAT A SINGLE MAN
WHO WAS NOT A MINISTER AT THE TIME HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS A DOMINATRIX CHESS DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT'S THE QUESTION HANG ON TABLOID WITH THIS STORY ARE YOU REALLY SERIOUSLY SAYING TO ME THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SAID THERE IS A SENIOR POLITICIAN NOW A MINISTER WE HAVE EVIDENCE THEY HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A DOMINATRIX HUBERT SAID OH NO NO NO NO THERE'S NO PUBLIC INTEREST IN PRINTING
THIS IS THE B.B.C. ABOUT JAIL SIR MIGHT I KNOW YOU WILL ANSWER AND THEN I GENERALLY YOU'VE GOT PLENTY TIME TO DO THAT O.K. WELL THE ANSWER IS
IN THE CURRENT WORLD THAT THE B.B.C. HACKED OFF ET-CETERA HAVE CREATED THERE IS A REAL ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU BREACH SOMEONE'S PRIVACY NOW LET'S GET THIS RIGHT ONE OF THE SAYINGS THAT AMUN HARRIS WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE WAS THESE TABLOID NEWSPAPERS NOT RUNNING THIS STORY LET'S GET THIS RIGHT JAMES TO PSYCHO I'D NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE REG'S BEES YESTERDAY
ACTUALLY WORK FOR THE INDEPENDENT ONLY NOW SUGGESTING THAT THE LEFT WING INDEPENDENT WHO ALONG WITH THE GUARDIAN AND THE B.B.C. HAVE JOINED WITH HACKED OFF AGAINST THE MEDIA OVER PRIVACY ISSUES THAT THE INDEPENDENT IS NOW PART OF SOME HUGE CONSPIRACY THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS IN THE WORLD WE ARE NOW LIVING IN WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN FACT
IS THE PRESS REGULATION IS WORKING OH KAY RAISES INTEREST OF STORING THEIR BIT IN A SENSE YOU'VE ANSWERED MY QUESTION AND IN A WAY NOT I THINK THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING LET'S JUST BE CLEAR YOU'RE SAYING WHEN YOU WERE A TABLOID EDITOR YOU ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE PUBLISHED A STORY LIKE THIS INDEED I CAN GIVE YOU A WHOLE SERIES OF EXAMPLES OF VERY SIMILAR SORT OF STORIES THE PAPERS DID PUBLISH BUT BECAUSE THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHANGE POST LEVERSON NOW THESE STORIES ON NOT PUBLISHED IS THAT YOURS IS THAT WHAT YOUR ARGUING
I HATE THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON THERE IN YEARS GONE BY
YES THIS STORY WOULD HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED I DO THINK THAT'S RIGHT BUT THE TRUTH IS THE WORLD HAS CHANGED WE DO NOT SEE STORIES BEING PUBLISHED LIKE THIS ANY MORE O.K. YOU LET'S GET UNLESS SOMEBODY HAS JUST BEEN DECLARED NEWSPAPER OF THE YEAR IT RUNS HEAVY HITTING BIG STORIES IT'S NOT AFRAID OF ANYBODY AND THIS STORY WAS NOT RUN ON TWO BASIS THE BASES ONE WAS WAS THE PRIVACY
WHAT DID THE STORY RATE THE INVASION OF PRIVACY THAT CAME WITH IT AND AT THE BOTTOM LINE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS SINGLE MAN DATED SINGLE WOMAN BEFORE HE WAS A MENACE O.K. WHAT YOU SAW HER RUNNING OUT ON ME I WANT THIS TO REALLY ELATION WORKS I WANNA PUT MY GIVE YOU CHANCE TO RESPOND WHAT NEIL WALLIS'S EFFECTIVELY SAYING IS THIS A CONSPIRACY NO BUT HE WOULDN'T LEAVE US LEVERSON
YOU KNOW THAT MEN'S ROOM ATTENDANT AT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AGAINST THE TABLOID PRESS O.K. IF HE THINKS THAT HE'S MADE THAT CASE I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THIS QUESTION THERE HE IS EFFECTIVELY SAYING REGULATION HE'S WORKING YOU SHOULD BE HERE CELEBRATING AND SAYING HERE IS A STORY THAT IS FRANKLY AN INTRUSION IN SOMEBODY'S PRIVATE LIFE IT WAS NOT PRINTED THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT YOU CAME INTO BUSINESS TO DO SO WHY ON EARTH AREN'T YOU CELEBRATING WE CAME INTO BUSINESS FOR THERE TO BE EFFECTIVE INDEPENDENT PRESS REGULATOR
WHICH WAS OVERSEEN INDEPENDENTLY AND THERE ISN'T ONE O.K. THERE'S THIS SHAM DIPSO IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT THERE A KISS AND TELL STORIES RUN EVERY WEEK IN THE TALLY WAS YOUR PAPERS
WITHOUT PUBLIC INTEREST JUSTIFICATION SO IF YOU JUST TAKE AN OBJECTIVE VIEW THE PRACTICE HASN'T CHANGED BUT THE KEY QUESTION IS JOHN WHICH ENTAILED BY DECIDING NOT TO COMMENCE THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH IS THIS PENALTIES HE'S NOT SAYING WE'LL REPEAL IT HE SAID HE HAD ANY MOMENT CAN PRESS A BUTTON AND WHEN WE ASKED HIM IN A MEETING
WHY HE WAS TAKING THIS POWER HE SAID IT WOULD KEEP THE PRESS ON ITS TOES IT'S GOOD THAT I HAVE THIS POWER OR LARS WORM HERE WELL THAT'S A LAST WORD WITH THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NEVER HAVE SUCH A POWER A LAST WORD FROM NEAR WHAT WAS THE IDEA THAT THESE STORIES ARE NEVER PRINTED IS SLIGHTLY GIVEN A LIE ISN'T IT BY THIS NEAR WANT THIS WHICH IS THE SECOND EDITION OF TODAY'S MIRROR IS SPLASHING ON THE STORY TOP TORY AND THE DOMINATRIX SO THE IDEA THE NAME WASTEPAPER PAPER THINGS PRESENT NEWSPAPER READERS ARE INTERESTED IS NONSENSE
IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT YOU MAKE BECAUSE ONE OF THE PAPERS IT DECIDED TO NOT PUBLISHED STORY THE STORY WAS THE PEOPLE THAT IS PART OF THE MIRROR GROUP THEY THEY UM THEY MIRROR TODAY HAVE RUN THE STORY FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON THE FACT THAT THE B.B.C. IS LEADING IT'S NEWS ON THIS INVASION OF PRIVACY INTO THIS GUY I KNOW YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
PROVING THIS IS ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS YOU SEE AND HACKED OFF CAMPAIGNING FOR FURTHER YOU NEED A POINT MANY MANY TIMES AND I'VE RESISTED BEING A SPOKESMAN FOR THE B.B.C. COS I ASK QUESTIONS I DON'T TAKE PART IN CONSPIRACIES OR INDEED SPEAK FOR THE B.B.C. BUT YOU'VE MADE THE POINT REPEATEDLY INTO AND HE WAS FIRST IN THE PRIVATE EYE THE STORY AND WE PURSUED IT HE'S NOT BECAUSE IT WAS INTERESTING AND IT'S PROVED TO BE JUST THAT THANK YOU NEIL WALLIS AND DOCTOR OF MERIT

BUT ALTHOUGH AUSTRALIA REJECTED THE IDEA OF A REPUBLIC IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THE LESS THAN AUTHORITATIVE IMAGE SURELY REVEALS AN AMBIVALENCE ABOUT THE MONARCHY IT IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO WAIT

WELL I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT IT MEANS THAT I'M DIFFERENT THAT I HAVEN'T GONE WITH THE CROWD THAT I HAVEN'T RISEN TO THE TEMPTATION TO SHINE AS A SO CALLED WORKING CLASS
WRITER I'VE ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE AWARE OF CLOTH CAPS TO SHOW WHERE THEY COME FROM
BECAUSE WHERE THEY COME FROM DOESN'T REALLY MATTER YOUNG NOT A GOOD RIDER BECAUSE YOU COME FROM A WORKING CLASS BACKGROUND AND YOU'RE NOT A GOOD WRITER BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH UNIVERSITY YOU'RE GOOD RIDE BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD WRITER IT'S THE WORK THAT MATTERS NOT THE LABELS THAT SURROUND
JOIN THE LINE BY THE GUARDIAN'S THEATRE CRITIC MICHAEL BILLINGTON GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW SHOULD WE REMEMBER HIM
WE HEARD HIM IN THAT CLIP A MOMENT AGO RESISTING THE IDEA OF LABELS BEING BEING PUT ON WRITERS AT THE LABEL OF THE GROUP THAT HE WAS OFTEN INCLUDED IN WAS THE ANGRY YOUNG MEN
IT'S EVENED AUDREY'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT HIM SINCE SINCE HEARING THE NEWS SAYING WITH HIS PASSING WE ARE BEGINNING TO LOSE THEIR VOICES OF A GENERATION THAT SHAPED THEATRE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT TODAY WOULD YOU WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT
MICHAEL BILLINGTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US ABOUT THE DEATH OF SIR ARNOLD WESKER WHO WAS EIGHTY THREE IT IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER IN A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING HIS CHANCE HERE SING CO CHAIR OF THE FAITHS FORUM FOR LONDON GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING LET ME BEGIN WITH A STORY
THE TRUE KING OF THE NORTH HAS BUILT A FORTRESS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND IS COMING UNDER ATTACK FROM THE SOUTHERN KING ON THE PEACOCK THRONE THE NATIONS IN TURMOIL AND THE TREE KING NEEDS RENEWED LOYALTY FROM HIS BANNERMAN TO KEEP HIS PEOPLE SAFE HE TURNS TO HIS SUPPORTERS AND ASKS THEM TO FORM A NEW BAND OF THE PURE ONES PROMISING TO MAKE THESE HEIST BARRY STRONG ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE A HAWK AND CALLING THEM THE KHALSA
YOU COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING I'VE GIVEN AWAY SPOILERS TO NEW SEASON OF GAME OF THRONES WHICH STARTS LATER THIS MONTH IN FACT IT'S A BACKGROUND TO THE SIKH FESTIVAL OF THE SUCKING BEING CELEBRATED AROUND THE WORLD TODAY
IN THE LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY MOGUL INDIA EXPERIENCE GREAT INSTABILITY AND MANY WERE PERSECUTED BY EMPEROR RUN SEB HE SAW GRECKO BEN'S NAME TO SIKHS AS A TRUE KING AS A DIRECT POLITICAL CHALLENGER AN ATTACK WAS IMMINENT AND ATTEMPTS GURU WANTED TO BE PREPARED
HE SUMMONED HIS SIKHS ON THE DAY OF THE SPRING HARVEST FESTIVAL THE SAKI IN SIXTEEN NINETY NINE AND CREATIVES THE KHALSA THE PURE ONES BECAME THE INNER CORE OF THE FAITH
MEN AND WOMEN YOUNG AND OLD RICH AND POOR WERE TREATED EQUALLY AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF ONE BIG FAMILY THERE WERE DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH AS WELL AS DEFENDERS OF ALL FAITHS MEANT AT THE SURNAME SINGH OR LION AND WOMEN KAUR OR PRINCESS
THE FOLLOWING CENTURY SAW BATTLES FOR SURVIVAL EVENTUALLY LEADING TO THE GOLDEN ERA OF THE SIKH EMPIRE UNDER RANJIT SINGH AS DISCUSSED ON RADIO FOUR'S IN OUR TIME JUST LAST WEEK
IN THE PRESENT DAY IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE UNEASE WITH HAVING A CHARISMATIC LEADER CREATING AN ARMED FORCE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT ONE CAN DRAW PARALLELS WITH FANTASY DRAMAS OR EVEN THE HORRORS I WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD RIGHT NOW
SUCH PARALLELS ARE THANKFULLY SUPERFICIAL THE KHALSA WAS ESTABLISHED AS A GROUP WILLING TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF EVERYONE TO LIVE IN PEACE AND HARMONY REGARDLESS OF THEIR VIEWS AND BELIEFS AND ONLY FIGHTING IN BASIL AS A LAST RESORT
THAT'S WHY SIKHS FOUGHT ALONGSIDE BRITISH FORCES IN THE FIRST AND SECOND WORLD WARS THAT'S WHY SIKHS CAN BE FOUND ALONGSIDE OTHERS FEELING THE STREET HOMELESS IN OUR TOWNS AND SETTEES HELP HELPING FLOOD VICTIMS IN YORKSHIRE AND CUMBRIA LAST WINTER AND TRAVELLING TO EUROPE AND BEYOND TO ASSIST WITH HUMANITARIAN RELIEF EFFORTS FOR THE REFUGEE CRISIS
TO HELP THE VULNERABLE TO RE STILL HUMAN DIGNITY TO PROVIDE COMFORT WHERE THE NECESSARY
BY MARKING THE BIRTHDAY OF THE KHALSA SIKHS CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF THEIR FAITH AS IT EXISTS TODAY IT'S A BEACON OF HOPE TO ALL AND HE MEANS IN THE WORDS ARE GONNA GO BEEN SAYING TO RECOGNISE THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY AS ONE
WISHING EVERYONE A VERY HAPPY WERE SAKE THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WERE JAZZ FEAR SEEING CO CHAIR OF THE FAITHS FORUM FOR LONDON
THE TIME IS NOW TEN TO EIGHT ALONGSIDE THE REGIONAL LOCAL AND MAYORAL ELECTIONS ON MAY THE FIFTH THERE WILL BE ELECTIONS AND ENGLAND AND WALES FOR POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONERS FORTY ONE OF THEM IN ALL ROLE HE'S ONLY BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WHEN A QUARTER OF THOSE WHO STOOD DID SO HIS INDEPENDENCE THIS TIME WITH THE ELECTION TAKING PLACE AMID OTHERS PARTY POLITICAL LINES MAY PLAY MORE OF A ROLE WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM COVENTRY BY RON BALL HE'S THE POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONER FOR WARWICKSHIRE ALTHOUGH STEPPING DOWN
AT THE ELECTION AND IN THE STUDIO BY GORDON WESTERMAN LORD WASIM AND FORMER GOVERNMENT ADVISOR ON POLICING AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND THE ARCHITECT OF C'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING GOOD MORNING LOOK WHAT THEY DIDN'T EXACTLY CAPTURED THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THEY WERE FIRST ELECTED IN FACT THERE WAS A ZERO TURNOUT AT ONE WELSH POLLING STATION
WELL I WASN'T VERY SURPRISED THEREFORE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS NO ONE HAD EVER THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS ANY REASON TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN POLICING IS P.C. WAS A SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND NO ONE THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD HAVE A SAY ABOUT THAT HOW THEIR LOCAL POLICE WERE ORGANISED HOW THEY WERE THEY PRIORITISE THEIR SERVICES AND IT WAS IT WAS ASSESSED
COMPLETELY UNKNOWN TO MOST PEOPLE AND NO EVEN THOUGH IT HAD BEEN CALLED BY THE GOVERNMENT A MOST SIGNIFICANT DEMOCRATIC REFORM OF POLICING IN A LIFETIME IT WAS INDEED BUT IT TAKES TIME FOR PEOPLE TO REALISE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENED WHAT HAVE THEY ACHIEVED THEN THE P.C. SEES IN THE FIRST FOUR YEARS I THINK THEY'VE BEEN ENORMOUS SUCCESS AND I FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE MUCH CLOSER IN THE POLICE YOU KNOW WHICH CLOSES THE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A P.C. SEE WHO HE IS AN INDIVIDUAL
WHO REACHES OUT TO THE PUB AGAIN WHO THE PUBLICAN OR RE SHOW TWO THEY HAD TAKEN A MUCH MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO CRIME PREVENTION BEYOND THE POLICE THE PROBATION SERVICE AND COURTS AND TO THE REST OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
THEY HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE INNOVATIVE THAN P.C. WAS BEFORE AND THEY HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE ACCOUNT
TO THE PUBLIC AND THE CHIEF CONSTABLES AND THEREFORE HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH THEIR PIECES AND IF THIS TIME BECAUSE THE ELECTIONS ARE GOING TO TAKE PLACE ON THE SAME DAY AS AS AS OTHER ELECTIONS THAT MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MIGHT THAT BE COUNTED BY THE FACT THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WELL NOW VOTE MORE ALONG PARTY LINES WHEN THEY'RE IN A BOOTH MAKING DECISIONS ON OTHER ELECTIONS AS WELL WELL I NEVER HAVE BEEN AGAINST PARTY BOTH EXCELLING PARTY POLITICS IS
FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY IF TWO OF US WANT TO GET TOGETHER AND ACHIEVE SOMETHING WE DECIDE TO HAVE A COMMON PLATFORM AND THREE FOUR OR FIVE OF US AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF POLITICAL PARTIES WE WANT TO LEAVE SPECIALLY TO BE POLITICAL SHOULD IT
I DON'T SEE WHY IT SHOULDN'T BE POLICING IS ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICE IF IT USES PUBLIC RESOURCES AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES BETWEEN COMPETING AIDS IS ESSENTIALLY A POLITICAL DECISION LET ME BRING IN RON BALL WHO'S BEEN IN THE POLICE AND CRIED COMMISSIONER FOR WARWICKSHIRE AND YOU STOOD AS AN INDEPENDENT MY BALL YES I DID AND I AGREE WITH QUITE A LOT OF WHAT LORD LOSSIEMOUTH SAID THEY'RE A POP GROUP THEY ARE BIT RIGHT AT THE END YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED TO HEAR
BECAUSE YOU DO YOU THINK YOU THINK POLITICS SHOULD BE KEPT OUT OF THIS ROLE THE POLICE FORCE IS HER MAJESTY'S POLICE FORCE IT'S NOT THE HOME SECRETARY'S POLICE FORCE AND I THINK ONE OF THE GENIUSES OF BRITISH LIFE IS THAT WE MAY MANAGE TO MAINTAIN THAT AND I DO THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN IT WON'T WIN THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY ABLE TO CONTINUE TO STAND AS INDEPENDENCE FOR THIS JOB
YES THEY ARE IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO STAND AS AN INDEPENDENT IT EFFECTIVELY COST ME A LOT OF MONEY TO TO GET THIS ROLE I DON'T OBJECT TO THAT I'VE HAD AN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL TIME DOING IT I REALLY ENJOYED THE JOB BUT EFFECTIVELY MY FIRST YEAR SALARY IN JUST THREE PENCE ME FROM WHAT IT COST ME TO GET THE JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE ELECTED YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE STANDING DOWN OR NOT YOU'RE CHOOSING NOT TO SERVE US SECOND TERM THAT'S CORRECT WHY
A NUMBER OF REASONS THE JOB AS IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS I'D DONE IT OVER THE PAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS HAS BEEN JUST BRILLIANT I'VE LOVED IT FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE DETERMINED TO EXPAND THE JOB IF YOU KNOW THE FIRE SERVICE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE INCLUDED
THAT ALL GOOD FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WELL IT MAY BE BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO IT IT JUST REQUIRES A MORE OF A POLITICIAN TO DO IT I'M NOT A POLITICIAN I DON'T WANT TO BE A POLITICIAN BUT AS A SAY OF ENJOYED DOING THE JOB I'VE DONE
ISN'T THAT A PROBLEM IF YOU'D GIVEN THEM THE COST THAT RUN BALL IS TALKING ABOUT ABOUT STANDING AS AS AN INDEPENDENT THAT IS A PROBLEM ISN'T IT IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU WANT A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE TO TAKE THIS JOB AND TO AND TO DO IT TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T BACKED BY POLITICAL PARTIES OR EFFECTIVELY EXCLUDE THE BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE NO OF COURSE ADORED HIM SCREWED THEM AND IF THEY BECAUSE THEY'RE INDEPENDENT TO ME THEY'RE NOT POLITICAL ME BALL IS IN A VERY EFFECTIVE POLITICAL OPERATOR HE'S BEEN EVASIVE WE MEAN TO GO FOR THE OFFICE AND THE PARTY POLITICAL I SIMPLY
I BELIEVE IN POLITICAL PARTIES I THINK GIVES MUCH EASIER FOR THE VULTURE COMES INTO ABOVE VOTING BOOTH SEES A LIST OF NAMES AT LEAST THE POLITICAL PARTY GIVES THEM SOME IDEA WHERE THIS PERSON'S COMING FROM THERE AT THEIR PRINCIPLES ARE THERE
POLICIES THEIR VALUES I THINK THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT RATHER THAN SAYING LOOK I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MAN STANDS FOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT KINDS OF DECISIONS YOU WILL MAKE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS I KNOW NOTHING OF HIS BACKGROUND HIS PRINCIPLES HIS HIS VIEWS
I FIND THAT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT PIG IN A POKE I MEAN HELLO WHO IS THIS MAN HE MAY BE VERY GOOD BUT CAN I TRUST HIM TO TAKE DECISIONS OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS ABOUT POLICING OF MY COMMUNITY WHERE HIS PARTY POLITICIAN I KNOW HAS BEEN VETTED BY THE PARTY IS ON THE WHOLE SOMEONE WHO STANDS FOR CERTAIN PRINCIPLES AND VALUES WHICH THEIR PARTY HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS BRIEFLY RUMPLE WOULD YOU STILL RECOMMEND THEIR JOB TO SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO DO IT AS AN INDEPENDENT
ABSOLUTELY IF THEY CAN AFFORD AFFORD TO DO IT MOST DEFINITELY WOULD BUT CAN I JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE SORT OF THING THAT I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HIM IN THE HOME SECRETARY AS WERE INTO CONSERVATIVE SUPPORTERS CLAIMING THAT IF YOU WANT SAFE STREETS IN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT POLICE FORCE VOTE CONSERVATIVE FOR ALL YOUR COMMISSIONER AND SHE'S A CONSERVATIVE WHY WOULDN'T YOU RECOMMEND THAT WELL THE EXPERIENCE IS THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND THAT'S THE SORT OF
PARTY POLITICS THAT PERSONALLY AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE DO NOT WANT INTRODUCED INTO POLICING RUN BALL AND GORDON LETTERMAN THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THE WEATHER IS CHRIS FAWKES AS THEY OCCUR QUITE SO MIXED WEATHER CONDITIONS TODAY ACROSS THE U.K. WILL START OFF WITH SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE FAR NORTH OF ENGLAND WHERE IT'S GOING TO STAY RATHER CLOUDY THROUGH THE DAY TODAY WITH SOME PATCHY OUTBREAKS OF RAIN THREE NOT REALLY AMOUNTING TO TOO MUCH SPOKE GIVEN A CLOUD IN THE DAMP WEATHER

THE SHADOW CULTURE SECRETARY MARIA EAGLE DEMANDED MY WISHING DEL STAND ASIDE FROM MAKING ANY FURTHER DECISIONS OVER LEVERSON BECAUSE OF A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR STANCE SUPPORTED BY THE CAMPAIGN GROUP HACKED OFF THEIR DIRECTOR IS BRIAN CATHCART HE'S MADE VERY IMPORTANT DECISIONS IN RELATION TO THE PRESS
DECISIONS THEY WELCOME WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY THE PUBLIC CAN'T HAVE FAITH IN HIS JUDGEMENT IN HIS INDEPENDENCE IN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE MEDIA
HOWEVER THE FORMER DEPUTY EDITOR OF THE NEWS OF THE WORLD NEIL WALLIS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT NEWSPAPERS ARE CHOSEN NOT TO PUBLISH THE STORY BECAUSE OF THE CHANGED CLIMATE IN THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY AFTER THE LEVERSON INQUIRY IN YEARS GONE BY
YES THIS STORY WOULD HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED I DO THINK THAT'S RIGHT BUT THE TRUTH IS THE WORLD HAS CHANGED WE DO NOT SEE STORIES BEING PUBLISHED LIKE THIS ANY MORE

TESCO HAS RETURNED TO THE BLACK AFTER MAKING ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSSES IN BRITISH CORPORATE HISTORY LAST YEAR IT'S POSTED PRE TAX PROFITS OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION POUNDS FOR THE YEAR TO FEBRUARY AGAINST LOSSES OF SIX POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS THE PREVIOUS YEAR MORE FROM OUR BUSINESS REPORTER ROB YEUNG
TESCO LIKE THE OTHER BIG SUPERMARKETS HAS BEEN BATTERED BY THE RISE OF DISCOUNTERS OLDIE AND LITTLE TESCO HAS HAD A PARTICULARLY TERRIBLE FEW YEARS IT'S LOST MARKET SHARE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE AND A YEAR AGO POSTED ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSSES IN U.K. CORPORATE HISTORY

ARRIVAL SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN POLAND ROMANIA AND HUNGARY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF THEIR GROWTH THE DIRECTOR OF THE MIGRATION OBSERVATORY MADELEINE SAMPSON TOLD US THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT MIGRANTS WERE MOTIVATED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF IN WORK BENEFITS
IN THEORY IT'S PLAUSIBLE THAT THEY COULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THEY DECIDE WHETHER TO MOVE BECAUSE IT MAKES IT MORE FINANCIALLY ATTRACTIVE TO COME TO THE U.K. AND THE QUESTION THEN IS JUST ONE HOW MANY PEOPLE MIGHT BE MAKING THE DECISION ON THIS BASIS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS THE STATISTICS AREN'T PERFECT ON THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE USING IN WORK BENEFITS BUT ALL OF THE STATISTICS SUGGEST THAT THE LARGE MAJORITY OF NOT TAKING THE BENEFITS WHICH SUGGEST THAT IT'S NOT THE MAJOR DRIVING FACTOR

IMMIGRATION NEW ANALYSIS OUT THIS MORNING CONFIRMS THAT IT'S THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTHERN EUROPE SPAIN PORTUGAL AND ITALY WHO ARE NOW ALMOST AS SIGNIFICANT AS THOSE COMING HERE FROM EASTERN EUROPE HERE'S THE VIEW FROM THE STREETS OF MADRID ABOUT WHY THAT IS MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE U.K. BECAUSE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR DUMB PEOPLE
AWFUL SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING
U.K. HAS THAT MUCH MOST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU AND THEY RECOVER FROM THE ECONOMY CAN'T RACE AS MUCH FASTER THAN THE SPAIN FOR SURE I KNOW A FEW PEOPLE
GONE TO THE U.K. LOOKING FOR JOBS BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO FIND A JOB NOWADAYS IN SPAIN BECAUSE THEY OFFER YOU A VERY PRECARIOUSLY TO AGE
BE DONE PAY WELL AND THEY MAKE YOU WORK FOR MANY HOURS
YOU YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO WORK IN THE SAME FOR FEEL AWARE OF YOUR STUDIES
I'VE GOT I'M GOING TO U.K. BECAUSE THEIR MINIMUM WAGE IS VENICE SPAIN SPANISH PEOPLE
OR TO WARRANT OUR MUM MONEY THAT'S THE VIEW FROM THE STREETS OF MADRID BUT WHAT SHOULD IT MEAN FOR THE DECISION THAT WILL BE TAKEN ON THE STREETS OF THE U.K. ABOUT WHETHER TO STAY IN OR GET OUT IT IS YOU WOULD THINK BEYOND DISPUTE THE COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE E.U. CAN DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES HOW TO CONTROL WHO COMES IN AND OUT OF THEIR COUNTRY
IT IS THOUGH ALSO YOU MIGHT THINK BEYOND DISPUTE THAT NO COUNTRY WHETHER IN OR OUT OF THE E.U. HAS THE FULL BENEFITS OF FREE TRADE ACROSS EUROPE'S BORDERS WITHOUT ALSO ALLOWING THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THEM LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME AGREEMENT NOT JUST DISAGREEMENT ON SOME OF THE FACTS MAYBE DISAGREEMENT ON THE JUDGEMENTS WITH THE SPOKESMAN FOR VOTE LEAVE STEVEN PARKINSON HE USED TO WORK FOR THE HOME SECRETARY AT THE HOME OFFICE
AND WILL STRAW WHO RUNS THE BRITAIN STRONGER IN EUROPE CAMPAIGNS MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING I'M GOING TO TRY TO GET YOU TO SEPARATE FAX
FROM JUDGEMENTS AND PREDICTIONS FACT ONE WILL STRAW IT IS A FACT IS IT NOT THAT IF ABOVE ALL YOU WANT TO CONTROL HOW MANY PEOPLE COME HERE FROM THE E.U. YOU WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE
TO DO IT IT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT WE COULD END FREE MOVEMENT AND THAT WOULD MEAN THAT PEOPLE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD FIND IT LESS EASY TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY BUT THERE'LL BE CONSEQUENCES FROM THAT AS WE WERE JUST SAYING THE MAIN CONSEQUENCE WOULD BE WE WOULD LOSE ACCESS TO OUR HOME MARKET THE SINGLE MARKET OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION CONSUMERS
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT JOBS WOULD BE LOST AND PRICES WOULD RISE BECAUSE IN ANY FREE TRADE DEAL THAT WE TRY TO ACHIEVE WITH THE E.U. WE WOULDN'T MANAGE TO GET FREE TRADE IN ALL THE SECTORS THAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT THAT LAST BIT IS THE JUDGEMENT THE FACT IS YOU ONLY REGAIN CONTROL IF YOU LEAVE
THE JUDGEMENT IS YOU THINK THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES IT'S A FACT THAT THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES THAT THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR SOMEONE ENDING FREE MOVEMENT WITHOUT BUT THEY'RE O.K. LET'S LET'S LET'S BRING YOU IN SEE THERE ARE PLENTY OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE PLACED THE COUNTRIES IN SOUTH AMERICA THAT HAVE SIGNED FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WITHOUT HAVING TO ACCEPT FREE MOVEMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO SURRENDER CONTROL OF THEIR BORDERS LET ME SEE IF YOU'LL ACCEPT A FACT BUT NO COUNTRY HAS GOT
ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF WHAT WE CALL THE SINGLE MARKET IN EUROPE COMPLETE FREE TRADE FOR GOODS AND SERVICES WITHOUT NOT JUST VISIBLE BERRIES BUT INVISIBLE BARRIERS AS WELL NO COUNTRIES GOT THAT COMPLETE ACCESS WITHOUT ALSO HAVING SOME FORM OF FREE MOVEMENT OF ME NOT YET NO COUNTRY HAS EVER NOT NOT NOT NOT YET NICK NICK COUNTRIES EVER LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION SUCH AS THE U.K. IS POSSIBLY GOING TO DO YOU PEOPLE THINK LEAVE ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE
WE ARE IN A MUCH STRONGER POSITION THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WITH THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE ARE THE LARGEST CUSTOMER FOR EUROPEAN UNION GOODS WE'VE GOT HUGE COMMERCIAL CLOUT TO NEGOTIATE A SORT OF DEAL THAT GIVES US THE BENEFITS THAT WE WANT TO ASSESS HER CLARITY IS CONTROL
YET IT IS A FACT BUT IT IS YOUR JUDGEMENT THAT IF WE LEFT WE COULD DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM NORWAY OR SWITZERLAND FOR EXAMPLE IS MUCH WETTER WHO DO YOU COULD DO OH K. WERE MAKING BREAD WE'VE GOT FACTS AND JUDGEMENTS HERE WILL STRAW IT IS A FACT ISN'T IT THEN WE TALK ABOUT WHO COMES FROM WHERE
IT WAS ACTUALLY THE INDEPENDENT DECISION OF A DIRECTLY ELECTED BRITISH GOVERNMENT THAT MEANT THAT WE DIDN'T CONTROL THE PEOPLE COMING FROM POLAND AND BULGARIA IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THAT WAS IMPOSED ON US
BITHIDH E. THAT'S RIGHT WE HAVE SOVEREIGNTY OVER THIS WE HAVE THE RIGHT AS WE ARE DOING IN THIS REFERENDUM TO CHOOSE WHETHER WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OR NOT WHETHER WE WANT TO ACCEPT FREE MOVEMENT AND WHETHER WE WANT TO BE PART OF THIS SINGLE MARKET OUR JUDGEMENT IS THAT THE PACKAGE DEAL THAT IS OFFERED OF HAVING FREE ACCESS FREE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WITH ALL THE INVESTMENT AND JOBS LOW PRICES THAT THAT BRINGS IS WORTH IT FOR THE FREE IF WE HAVE AS WELL BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO THIS BECAUSE
THERE ARE MANY BRITS WHO LIVE IN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE THANKS TO FREE MOVEMENT FOR MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HOPE TO WORK TRAVEL OR STUDY BROUGHT AND IF WE ENDED FREE MOVEMENT IT WOULDN'T JUST STOP PEOPLE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY IT WOULD STOP THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRITS TO TRAVEL ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE OR FAX AND JUDGEMENT LET ME JUST SEE IF STEPHEN BOBBINS YOU AGREE YOU'RE IN THE HOME OFFICE IF THE HOME SECRETARY IF YOU WERE STILL WORKING FOR THEM IN ANOTHER COUNTRY JOINED THE E.U. IN THE WAY THAT VARIOUS COUNTRIES HAVE IN THE PAST IT IS A FACT ISN'T IT THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT COULD CHOOSE TO CONTROL
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WELL WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE TRANSITIONAL CONTROLS ACTING WITH TWENTY SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES NOT MAKING JUDGEMENTS FOR WHAT IS THE BEST FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM AND FOR OUR ECONOMY THAT WAS POSSIBLE LAST TIME THERE WAS A SEVEN YEAR TRANSITIONAL CONTROL OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CHOSE NOT TO USE IT WELL EXACTLY AND WE SAW WE HAD CONTROL BUT WE KNOW WE SAW AND WE SAW THE CONSEQUENCES IF YOU GIVE ME WE HAD CONTROL WHICH I CHOOSE NOT TO USE UP UNTIL FOR SEVEN YEARS A LIMIT LIMITED CONTROL
WE DON'T HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER OUR BOARDS WE CAN'T DECIDE WHO IT ISN'T ISN'T ABOUT COUNTRY IN THE E.U. WANTS TO LET MORE MEMBER STATES INTO THE CLUB COUNTRIES LIKE SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO AND ALBANIA AND TURKEY WHICH HAS SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION CITIZENS NOT ONLY IS THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A LABOUR MARKET
THAT'S A COUNTRY MUCH LARGER THAN US HE'D HAVE MORE VOTES AROUND THE TABLE IF WE STAYED IN THE E.U. TO WILL'S ROLE WHAT ARE YOU SAYING IS IT IS A FACT AGAIN THAT WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THESE THINGS WE MIGHT WISH TO HAVE CONTROL BUT IT'S OFTEN JUST TEMPORARY AND IT DEPENDS ON GETTING THE SUPPORT FROM OTHER PEOPLE WE HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE SO LONG AS WE ARE A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT MEANS THAT IF TURKEY WAS TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE HAVE A COMPLETE VETO
WE COULD SAY NO WE DON'T WANT TURKEY TO JOIN WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMING HERE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO GET ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET SO IT IS A SCARE STORY TO SAY THAT TURKEY IS GOING TO JOIN AND ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME TO THE U.K. DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THAT IS A FACT IT'S NOT A MINI EVEN NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A REFERENDUM WHEN EVERYONE IN THE E.U. IS TRYING THEIR BEST TO PERSUADE THE ELECTORATE TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE E.U. IS SIGNING AGH FOR A VISA FREE ACCESS TO DEAL WITH WITH TURKEY GIVING
SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION CITIZENS OF TURKEY UNRESTRICTED ACCESS VISA FREE TO THEE TO THEE TO THEE BUT WE USED TO ELECT A GOVERNMENT THAT WAS COMMITTED TO NOT LETTING TURKEY IN THAT WOULD BE CONTROL EXERCISED BY THE BRITISH PEOPLE IN A GENERAL ELECTION THEY THEY THEY COULD GET HER WE'D HAVE BUT WE HAVE AND WE DO HAVE A VETO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS DEBATE WERE CLEAR THAT THAT IS A VETO FOR THE U.K.
OVER TURKEY WHAT DO YOU THINK WE LEARN FROM THE RESEARCH THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY NAMELY THAT WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COMING FROM SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FROM PORTUGAL FROM SPAIN FROM ITALY AND THEY ARE BEGINNING TO CATCH UP THERE'S A WAY TO GET THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING
FROM EASTERN EUROPE HAS WILL STEPHEN PARKMAN YOU WORKED AT FIGURES WERE COMING IT WELL EXACTLY I MEAN I THINK THIS DEED THE REPORT TELLS US WHAT WE KNOW PEOPLE COME TO THE U.K. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS NOT AS THE PRIME MINISTER HAS CLAIMED IN THE CONTEXT OF HIS RENEGOTIATION BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CLAIM BENEFITS THERE'S NOTHING IN HIS RENEGOTIATION DEAL THAT WILL HELP US TO CONTROL NUMBERS I REMEMBER WHEN I WORKED AT THE HOME OFFICE THE PRODUCT THE PRIME MINISTER MADE A SPEECH JUST BEFORE THE LAST ELECTION SAYING THAT ANYONE COMING TO
OF THE U.K. FROM THE Y. YOU SHOULD HAVE A FIRM JOB OFFER BEFORE THEY CAME HERE HE DIDN'T PUT THAT INTO HIS NEGOTIATION DEAL WHEN HE CAME ROUND TO IT I THINK THAT'S A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITY STRAW IN A SENSE IT SHOWS HOW LITTLE CONTROL YOU CAN HAVE ANY OF PEOPLE ARE POOR IN ONE COUNTRY THEY COULD GET A JOB IN ANOTHER THEY MOVE YOU WOULD I WOULD LOTS OF PEOPLE WOULD WELL THIS REPORT TELLS US WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO TO RESPOND TO IT NO I THINK MOST PEOPLE WANT A FAIR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM NOT A FREE FOR ALL AND ACTUALLY WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER
DELIVER THE RENEGOTIATION FEBRUARY SOMETHING THAT BOTH THE LABOUR PARTY AND CONSERVATIVES ARE CALL FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION WAS A BRAKE ON PEOPLE COMING HERE AND BEING ABLE TO GET IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO BENEFITS THAT I THINK WILL REDUCE ONE PULL FACTOR BUT MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT PEOPLE COME HERE WORK HARD PAY THEIR TAXES AND CONTRIBUTE THEY SHOULD BE WELL AT THAT IS THAT IT THAT IS A JUDGEMENT YOU CAN SEE STEVEN BUT HE DID THE SERIES I DIDN'T GO WE GOT IT WE WANTED THE CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO SAID HE WANTED A FOUR YEAR BREAK AND HE DIDN'T GET IT GENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AN M.P. HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A SEX WORKER THE M.P. THEN BECAME A GOVERNMENT MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRESS JOURNALISTS KNEW ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND WERE DIVIDED ON WHETHER DIVULGING IT WAS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT IS THE REAL SURROUNDING JOHN WISHING DEL THE CULTURE SECRETARY AT THE MOMENT LABOUR CALLING FOR HIM TO WITHDRAW FROM THE PRESS REGULATION ASPECT OF HIS ROLE WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA COULDN'T SPARE WHAT IS DOWNING STREET SAYING ABOUT THIS
THIS MORNING THE SHOWER NUMBER TEN ARE SAYING LOOK USE A SINGLE MAN HE IS ENTITLED TO A PRIVATE LIFE IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS WHEN HE ACCEPTED THE JOB OF BEING CULTURE SECRETARY AND YOU KNOW HOW HAVE WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THIS STRANGE SITUATION WHERE WE'VE GOT PRIVACY CAMPAIGNERS WHO PUSH FOR TIGHTER RULES ARE UP IN ARMS BECAUSE THE PRIVATE LIFE OF A SINGLE CABINET MINISTER WAS NOT REPORTED I THINK IF PEOPLE WILL BE SCRATCHING THEIR HEAD ABOUT THIS SO LET'S JUST BRIEFLY START WITH WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENED
AS YOU SAID IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN UNTIL FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN JOHN WETTING DALE WAS CHAIR OF THE POWERFUL CULTURE COMMITTEE HE HAD THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN WHO WE MET ONLINE HE ONLY FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS A SEX WORKER WHEN A REPORTER CONTACTED HIM WITH INFORMATION AS SOON AS HE WAS AWARE HE ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP IT WAS MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE HE WAS THEN PROMOTED TO BE THE CULTURE SECRETARY TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR A PRESS REGULATION
HE DIDN'T TELL NUMBER TEN THAT SOME OF THE NEWSPAPERS HAD THIS STORY ABOUT HIS PRIVATE LIFE THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A SWORD OF DAMOCLES HANGING OVER HIS HEAD AND A POLITICAL QUESTION IS REALLY WHETHER OR NOT HE KNOWINGLY ENTERED INTO AN INSUFFERABLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST WOULD HIS DECISIONS ON THE PRESS THE ACCUSATION AT THE GOVERNMENT DRAGGED ITS FEET OVER AFRAID OF TIGHTENING OF THE RULES WERE INFLUENCED BY HIS OWN SITUATION HE ABSOLUTELY DENIES
NUMBER TEN DENIES THAT THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY DELIGHTED ABOUT ALL THIS BUT THEY'RE CLEAR HE'S A SINGLE MAN HE HAD A RELATIONSHIP MOVE ON RYE BREAD LABOUR ARE SAYING THAT THE PART OF HIS ROLE WHICH DEALS WITH PRESS REGULATION IS ONE THAT HE SHOULD WITHDRAW HIMSELF FROM
YES THEY ARE SAYING THAT HE CANNOT DIDN'T KNOW HE CAN NO LONGER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PART OF HIS JOB THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S UNFINISHED BUSINESS FROM THE LEVERSON INQUIRY INTO THE HACKING SCANDAL REMEMBER THAT
THERE ARE SEVERAL PARTS TO THIS FOR ONE LEVISON TOO THERE WAS MEANT TO BE A SECOND PART OF THE WHOLE INQUIRY LOOKING INTO TIES BETWEEN THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE POLICE THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET IT'S BEEN PUT ON HOLD WHILE THE LEGAL PROCESSES WERE COMPLETED BUT THIS SCEPTICISM AROUND WESTMINSTER OVER WHETHER IT WILL EVER TAKE PLACE MY WETTING DEL SAID IN MARCH AT NUMBER TEN HAVE REPEATED THIS MORNING THEY CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT UNTIL CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS ARE FINISHED
REMAINS THE CASE BUT THERE IS A SUGGESTION WERE BROADLY PUT FORWARD BY PRIVACY CAMPAIGNERS THAT THE GOVERNMENTS HAVE GONE SOFT ON ALL OF THIS GONE SOFT ON THE REAL TIGHTENING OF THE RULES AT THE END OF LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE MISTER WITTY DEL ANNOUNCED THAT PAPERS COULD BE PROTECTED FROM PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN SOME CASES AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE BIG RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE LEVERSON INQUIRY THAT PAPERS BE REGULATED UNDER A ROYAL CHARTER STILL HASN'T HAPPENED
LET THE NEWSPAPERS AS WE'VE HAD ON THIS PROGRAMME THIS MORNING WOULD SAY THAT THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN ANY CASE IT'S FOR THE BIRDS TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL LAST THINGS WERE PRE THE HACKING SCANDAL BUT LABOUR'S POINT IS THAT JOHN WETTING DALE CANNOT POSSIBLY BE IN CHARGE OF PRESS REGULATION IN FUTURE AND HE SHOULD STEP ASIDE BECAUSE HE'S VULNERABLE
HAS BEEN VULNERABLE TO PRESSURE FROM THE PRESS BECAUSE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP SOURCES IN GOVERNMENT I MUST SAY SUGGEST IT WOULD BE LUDICROUS FOR HIM TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FACT THAT NEWSPAPERS DECIDED NOT TO PUBLISH A STORY ABOUT HIS PRIVATE LIFE IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING DONE WETTING DALE AS A POLITICAL CHARACTER WOULD ALWAYS HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO CHOOSE A LIGHTER TOUCH FORM OF REGULATION IN ANY CASE BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY THE KIND OF HEADACHE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD REALLY DO WITHOUT GIVEN EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON AT THE MOMENT LAURA KINSBERG THANK YOU
IT IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT WHEN THE GERMAN JOURNALIST YOU'RE GOING TOWARD AND HER FOAL WENT INSIDE TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IN DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN IT WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE HEADINGS OF WESTERN HOSTAGES HAD BEGUN HE SPENT TEN DAYS WITH THEM IN SYRIA AND IRAQ AND HAS WRITTEN A BOOK CALLED MY JOURNEY INTO THE HEART OF TERROR HE'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING MORNING AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK
WHAT ON EARTH POSSESSED YOU TO MAKE A JOURNEY LIKE THAT AT A TIME OF SO MUCH PERIL FOR WESTERNERS THIS WAS THE QUESTION MY SON WAS ASKING A VERY DAY HE SAID THEY WANT TO KILL YOU BUT I WANTED TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH I KNOW I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH O.K. THE FREE ARMY AND OTHER ABILITIES I MET SEVERAL TIMES A SAP
AND SUDDENLY ISIS APPEARED AND I SAW THAT ISIS WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND I THINK
TO DEFEAT AN ENEMY IF YOU HAVE TO KNOW HIM AND THEREFORE I TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM THERE WITH THEIR MEDIA DEPARTMENT IN FACT
IT'S NOT ONLY THE PATTER AND IMMEDIATELY PROBLEM MAKES THAT ARRANGEMENT LIKE IF YOU WANT TO SEE A CAMERA AND HUGE MEDIA DEPARTMENT TO TALK WAS SO I MET LET'S SAY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TERRORIST LIFT WITH THEM YOU DON'T JUST WANT TO JUST ASK YOU ABOUT BEFORE YOU MADE THE JOURNEY SAID DID THEY ASHORE YOU THAT YOU WOULD BE SAFE
THEY GAVE ME I ASK AND I HAS TO GUARANTEE FROM THE COUNTRY THE SO CALLED KHALIF AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT AN I SAID THEN I WILL NOT COME OUT AT THE END I GOT THIS COUNTY AND I ASKED THEM TO PUBLISH THE GUARANTEE
ON TWITTER AND THEY DID IT AND I HAD A LOT OF GOT A LOT OF COMMENTS SAYING OH WE ARE SO GLAD THAT YOU'VE GOT HIM OR YOU WON'T GET HIM AND POLICE BEHEAD HIM AND KEEP HIM AND IT WAS VERY THREATENING AND MY SON CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN A SETS THE SCENE THEY WANT TO KILL YOU WHY DO YOU GO THERE AND YOUR SON ACCOMPANIED YOU GOT GRIFFON WHO OBLIGED ME HE SAID I HAVE ARRANGED TO INTERNET CONTACTS
AND WITHOUT YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THIS TRIP SO YOU CANNOT DO THAT TO ME IF YOU'RE A KILT I WILL BE GUILTY FOR MY WHOLE LIFE YOU CANNOT DO THAT FOR ME AND I SAID YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE BECAUSE I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND MY WIFE AND HE SAID NO I CANNOT LIVE A LIFE WHERE I FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR DEATH
SO YOU WIN BUT I WAS SURE THAT I WOULD SURVIVE YOU WERE NEVER AND THANKFULLY THAT THAT WAS THE CASE WHAT DID YOU LEARN IN THE COURSE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS YOU GO INTO THEM IN THE BOOK CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY OF THE PEOPLE YOU MET INCLUDING SOME HAD COME FROM EUROPE TO JOIN
BUT I THINK IF I WOULD ASK YOU YOU HAVE HAD TO TERRORISTS IN THIS COUNTRY AT ALL YOU HAD IRISH TERRORISTS AND SO ON AND IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE WITH THEM TEN DAYS NOT JUST MEETING THEN WE SLEPT ON THE SAME FLOOR
SOMETIMES THERE WAS ONLY KALASHNIKOV BETWEEN US AND YOU START TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND YOU HOLD IT
AND I THINK IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT WHAT I FOUND OUT I WAS ATTACHED IN THAT IN A TRIAL AGAINST TERRORISTS IN MY YOUNGER DAYS SO I KNOW THIS PHENOMENA AND I FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY A VERY VERY DANGEROUS ORGANISATION IS MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN WE THINK EVEN IF YOU WERE DEFEATED THEM DIS TRYING TO SIT HIS KILLING TEN TIMES
THEY WOULDN'T BE DEFEATED THEY WOULD USE THAT YOU KNOW ONCE YOU'VE BEEN THERE AT THE DATE THEY HAD LOST TERRITORY YOUR JOURNEY YEAH THEY LAST I HAVE THE RIGHT AT THE CORRECT INFORMATION I THINK THE LAST IN THE IRAQ INSISTS HERE AROUND ABOUT
ALMOST TWENTY PERCENT NOT THERE FOR DIPPERS AND AMERICANS ARE SAYING BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT THEY ARE EVERYWHERE THIS ISN'T AND GET REALLY OF MOVEMENT SO IF THE AMERICANS ONE TOOL THE VALLEYS FROM THE VIETNAMESE IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING
THEY WILL WIN FOR OTHERS AND THEY TOOK A BIG TERRITORY AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES THEY CONTINUE AND CONTINUE BUT IT IS THE LEVEL OF DEPRAVITY AND THAT WAS THAT THAT STANDS OUT FOR MOST OF US IN THE WEST WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR GROUP AND THERE WAS NO CLEARER EXAMPLE OF THAT THAN THE BEHEADING OF THOSE
OF THOSE HOSTAGES OUT WHEN YOU YOU ASKED THEM PRESUMABLY ABOUT THERE WHY WHY DO YOU DO THINGS LIKE THIS DID YOU ASK YOURSELF AND AT THE SUMMER HOUSE A FRIEND JAMES SURELY I KNEW HIM FROM BENGHAZI WHEN HE WAS BEHEADED I SIDE ON T.V.
AND AS A WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS AS A JOURNALIST HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING AND YOU SAY YOU ARE FIGHTING AGAINST THE AMERICAN INVASION WHICH WAS AN UNJUSTIFIED INVASION WHICH WAS A CRIMINAL INVASION AND SO ON SO YOU HAVE MAYBE THE RIDER FOR ASSISTANCE BUT THERE'S NO RIDE OF THE WHAT DID THEY ANSWER THAT QUESTION THEY SAID BUT IT WOULD DO THE SAME AS THEY DO SO THEY'RE RATIONAL RATIONAL THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT MAD
NO THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE SOMETIMES VERY INTELLIGENT BUT COMPLETELY BRAINWASHED YOU NO
WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG SO THEY HAVE THEIR REASON TO DO SOMETHING WRONG ALSO AND THEY'D BE PLAN HORRIBLE THINGS THEY PLAN TO KILL ALL THE OTHER RELATION RESISTANCE BESIDE JEWS CHRISTIANS AND AND I SAYS MOST LAMBS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS THEY SAY IT THEY SAY WOULD KILL FIVE HUNDRED BID WE DON'T CARE YOU CAN DO IT HORRIBLE

THANK YOU LYDIA LOOK AT THE WEATHER THERE'S GOING TO BE OCCASIONAL RAIN IN THE NORTH SUNSHINE AND SCATTERED SHOWERS IN THE SOUTH YOU'RE LISTENING TO DRAIN READY FORWARD MICHELLE A SANE AND NICK ROBINSON THE TIME IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE AND SUSAN RAY HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS
LABOUR HAS CALLED ON THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN PUTTING DEAL TO WITHDRAW FROM ANY FURTHER DECISIONS ABOUT PRESS REGULATION THE SHADOW CULTURE SECRETARY MARIA EAGLE SAYS HE'S VULNERABLE TO PRESSURE FROM NEWSPAPERS BECAUSE OF HER PAST RELATIONSHIP WITH A SEX WORKER IT'S HER WEDDING DEAL HAS DENIED THAT NEWSPAPER INVESTIGATIONS HAVE INFLUENCED ANY OF THE DECISIONS HE'S MADE FOUR PAPERS WHICH LEARNED OF THEIR SIX MONTH LIAISON DECIDED NOT TO PUBLISH THE STORY SAYING IT WASN'T IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST SUPERMARKET CHAIN TESCO HAS RETURNED A PROFIT A YEAR AFTER POSTING ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSSES IN U.K. CORPORATE HISTORY TESCO MADE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MILLION POUNDS BEFORE TAX FOLLOWING LOSSES OF MORE THAN SIX BILLION POUNDS THE PREVIOUS YEAR IS ALSO REPORTED ITS FIRST QUARTERLY U.K. SALES GROWTH FOR THREE YEARS
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS FROM SOUTHERN E.U. COUNTRIES HAVE COME TO THE U.K. BECAUSE OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AT HOME OXFORD UNIVERSITY'S MIGRATION OBSERVATORY SAYS PEOPLE FROM SPAIN PORTUGAL AND ITALY ACCOUNT FOR A QUARTER OF Y. ARRIVAL SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN
THE BRITISH PLAYWRIGHTS SIR ARNOLD WESKER WHO ROSE TO FAME IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY THREE HE ATTRACTED PUBLIC AND CRITICAL ACCLAIM FOR HIS TRILOGY OF PLAYS CHICKEN SOUP WITH BARLEY ROOTS AND I'M TALKING ABOUT JERUSALEM
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE TO NINE PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY IS BEING UNDERMINED BY MECHANISMS DATING BACK MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS WHICH ALLOW LAWS TO BE CHANGED WITHOUT A FULL MEASURE OF SCRUTINY THAT IS WHAT THE FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE LORD JUDGE IS SAYING ABOUT THE GROWTH OF HENRY THE EIGHTH CLAUSES AND THE USE OF STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS THEY ENABLE MINISTERS TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY THROUGH PARLIAMENT THAN IF THEY BROUGHT FORWARD A NEW BILL
A LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CLIVE COLEMAN HAS BEEN SPEAKING EXCLUSIVELY TO LORD JUDD AND ASKED HIM FIRST TO EXPLAIN WHAT THESE CLAUSES PERMIT THE EXECUTIVE TO DO THEY ENABLE A MINISTER TO GO TO PARLIAMENT TO SEEK APPROVAL OF PARLIAMENT
TO CHANGE STATUTE OR MEN STATUTE ABOLISH STATUTE DISPENSE WITH STATUTE
IN OTHER WORDS THROUGH THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCESSES WE CAN END UP WITH AS A LAW BEING CHANGED BY IN EFFECT RESOLUTION
AND THAT'S WORRYING TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THEY I THINK WILL ASSUME BID IN ALMOST ALL CASES THERE IS PROPER FULL PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY AND IT'S NOT JUST UP TO ONE INDIVIDUAL A MINISTER TO TO CHANGE THE LAW
I'M SURE IT SHOULD BUT IF YOU REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE ELEVEN THOUSAND TO THIRTEEN THOUSAND PAGES OF STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS EVERY YEAR EVERY YEAR
AND WE HAD A HOUSE OF COMMONS THAT HE'S EXTREMELY BUSY WITH PRIMARY LEGISLATION
IT IS IN FACT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO SUPERVISE ALL THIS LEGISLATION HAVE YOU EVER TRIED READING A STATUTORY REGULATION LET ALONE TEN THOUSAND TWELVE THOUSAND PAGES OF IT IT'S VERY BORING AND VERY DIFFICULT
SO A LOT OF THE SUPERVISORY ELEMENT OF THIS IS CARRIED OUT BY COMMITTEES IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS HOUSE OF LORDS WILL MAKE COMMITTEES WILL MAKE REPEATED COMMENTS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF
HENRY THE EIGHTH CLAUSES WHY BILLS BEING PRODUCED WHICH DON'T ACTUALLY SAY ANYTHING VERY MUCH KEEPING EVERYTHING TO REGULATION AND SO ON SOMETIMES THAT HAS EFFECT WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THEY REMOVE THEM FROM THE BILLS BUT THERE'S NO OBLIGATION ON THE GOVERNMENT TO DO SO AND IN FACT WE DO HAVE FREQUENT THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS WHICH LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE CHILDCARE
WHO IS AGAINST CHILD CARE WE'RE ALL IN FAVOUR OF IT IT'S SAYS NOTHING AT ALL THERE ARE ELEVEN SECTIONS CREATING REGULATION POWERS ON THE MINISTER AND THEN THERE'S A FINAL ONE WHICH ENABLES THE REGULATION TO CONFER A DISCRETION ON ANY PERSON
TO AMEND REPEAL REVOKE ANY PROVISION MADE BY UND UNDER AN ACT WHENEVER PAST OR MADE I EVEN LOOKING TO SOME FUTURE ACT SOMEBODY ON REGULATION BY APPOINTMENT BY THE MINISTER WILL BE ABLE TO
DE SUPPLY THAT ACT IT'S VERY SERIOUS ACTUALLY
I'M NOT SAYING THE EXECUTIVE IS SEIZING POWER I'M SAYING THAT OUR CONSTITUTION PROCESSES ARE EVOLVING IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE TO COIN A PHRASE USED TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO HAS INCREASED HIS INCREASING AND OUGHT TO BE DIMINISHED
LORD JUDGE SPEAKING TO CLIVE COLEMAN WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE FORMER LABOUR HOME SECRETARY AND LORD CHANCELLOR JACK STRAW GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING IT'S IS A VERY SERIOUS CHARGE THAT THE USED BY MINISTERS OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS UNDERMINING PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY
I DON'T THINK IT IS IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE LAW JUDGED SAYS THEY WERE AND I LISTENED I WENT TO HIS LECTURE I LISTEN CAREFULLY TO IT YESTERDAY WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH TWO THINGS THERE IS ONE OF THE GENERALITY STARTED TO INSTRUMENTS MOST OF WHICH I MEAN I HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF READING HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF THESE THEY ARE AH
TEDIOUS BEYOND BELIEF AND THEY USUALLY CHANGING MINOR CHANGES TO REGULATIONS OF ALL KINDS AND EMMA AND IT WERE JUST CLOG UP PARLIAMENT IF THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH
PRIMARY LEGISLATION WITH A VERY LENGTHY PROCESS THERE'S A SEPARATE ISSUE WHICH IS ABOUT THE SO CALLED HENRY THE EIGHTH CLAUSES ON WHICH I THINK ARE NO JUDGES ON TO SOMETHING WHERE I DISCOVERED FROM LORD JUDGES LECTURE THAT I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THESE AT THE VERY LAST ACT OF THE OF THE LAST GOVERNMENT WHERE
VERY VERY GOOD REASONS OF COURSE IN THE COSTUME SHALL REFORMER GOVERNMENTS ACT BY SECTION FIFTY ONE THERE'S A POWER GIVEN TO AMEND OTHER ASPECTS OF PRIMARY LEGISLATION IT'S NEVER BEEN USED WHY DID WE DO IT BECAUSE WE HAD TO GET LEGISLATION THROUGH ON PARLIAMENTARY EXPENSES HONEY ANTS AND WE HAD THEREFORE TO TWO
PROVIDE FOR REMEMBRANCE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN PICKED UP EARLIER IT'S SO I MEAN MY VIEW IS THAT LAW JUDGES RIGHT TO SAY THAT AND OTHERS HAVE SAID THIS TO THAT
WE SHOULD ABANDON HENRY THE CLAUSES FOR THEMSELVES BUT I WHERE I DISAGREE WITH HIM IS WHETHER THE COMMONS AND PARLIAMENT'S BECOME MORE OR LESS EFFECTIVE IN HOLDING THE EXECUTIVE TO ACCOUNT WELL BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCALE OF THIS IT LOOKS RATHER DIFFERENT DOESN'T IT I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE PORTRAYING THESE TREATMENTS AS IF THEY ARE YOU KNOW WELL THAT THERE MAY BE MANY BUT THEY'RE JUST DEALING WITH WITH MINOR ISSUES BUT IT'S ELEVEN TO THIRTEEN THOUSAND PAGES WHICH ARE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THEN VERY DIFFICULT TO SCRUTINISE YOU CAN SORT OF SUGGEST THE PARLIAMENT'S BEEN DONE A FAVOUR
BY NOT HAVING TO TO SIT AND READ THROUGH THEM BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT THOUGH THEY ARE THEY ARE I MEAN THEY THEY ARE READ THROUGH VERY CAREFULLY THEY GO TO COMMITTEES BOTH IN THE COMMONS AND THE LORDS ARE LORDS DOES A REALLY IMPORTANT JOB IN TERMS OF GOING THROUGH THE
DETAIL OF THESE AND THAT SOMETIMES ACCUSED OF BEING ON DEMOCRATIC AS WAS THE CASE WHEN WHEN IT IN OVER YOUR DOVER THE TAX THE TAX CREDIT ON WAS NOT NOT A CHAT NOT LET ME SAY IT WAS NOT A HENRY THE EIGHTH CLAWS TAX GROUPS WAS IN MY VIEW QUITE QUITE INAPPROPRIATE GIVEN WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS DOING AN ACT WHICH WAS DESIGNED
GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWO TO RAISE UP A PLATFORM FOR INCREASING CHILD BENEFITS ANOTHER TAX CREDITS IT DECIDED TO USE THAT EFFECT IT IT EFFECTIVELY TO ABOLISH ENTITLEMENTS AND THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY STATURE PRIMARY LEGISLATION AND IN THE END THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO DO IT CAN I JUST MAKE THIS POINT ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS
OF PARLIAMENTARIANS IN THE COMMENTS IF I THINK BACK FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN I WORKED FOR THE FOR TWO CABINET MINISTERS IN THE LAST OF THE PEAT THAT LABOUR GOVERNMENT IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES COMPARE THE LEVEL OF SCRUTINY WHICH BARBARA CASTLE PETER SHOREHAM COMPARED WITH TODAY'S LEVEL OF SCRUTINY YES I DO IT'S NOT PUBLIC SCRUTINY OR PRESS SCRUTINY AND PARLIAMENT I MEAN THEY WERE MOSTLY COMMITTEES FORTY YEARS AGO TO SPEAK SPEAK OF
MINISTERS DIDN'T HAVE TO ATTEND PARLIAMENT AS OFTEN AS THEY DO TODAY THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING BROUGHT TO A HOUSE EMERGENCY STATEMENT FOR FAR FEWER PACIFIC POINT THAT TODAY YOU ARE ABLE TO ABOLISH A STATUTE A PRIME PIECE OF PRIMARY LEGISLATION THROUGH THE USE OF THE STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS
CAN THAT BE RIGHT I DON'T HAVE TO BRING FORWARD A NEW LAW LIGHT I DON'T DEFEND THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT I DO SIR AND I SAY I'M SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED WHEN LORD JUDGE POINTED OUT THAT I'VE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THESE HAPPILY NEVER USED I THINK AND CERTAINLY HIS HIS POINT ABOUT THE CHILDCARE ACT WHICH IS SIMPLY APED THE LOOSE FRAMEWORK WITH ALL THE REST TO BE ADDED BY REGULATION
IS I THINK A VERY SOUND ONE WE SHOULDN'T LEGISLATE IN THAT WAY BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNISE THAT
GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENT WE JUST GRIND TO A HALT IF EVERY SINGLE MINER PIECE OF REGULATION HAD TO GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS AS A PRIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE PUBLIC ARE SICK OF THE RICH NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES SO SAYS THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN IS PEOPLE ARE STILL DIGESTING THE REVELATIONS IN THE PANAMA PAPERS RAISES THE QUESTION OF COURSE WHAT COULD A FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT DO ABOUT IT THIS MORNING DIANE ABBOTT SAYS THAT IF SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SHE WOULD STOP HER DEPARTMENT USING THE SERVICES OF THE BIG FOUR ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS
THEY CONTINUE TO USE OR ADVISE THE WORLD'S TAX HAVENS SHE'S HERE AND CAN TELL US MORE MORNING TO YOU
YOU DISAPPROVE OF THIS BEHAVIOUR YES BUT WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE THAT YOU COULD HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON WHAT THESE BIG FOUR ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS DO FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE THE BIG FOUR K.P.M.G. P.W.C. TONIGHT'S NETS AND YOUNG ARE INVOLVED IN FACILITATING TAX AVOIDANCE ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE THEY ALL HAVE OFFICES IN A B. F. B. V. I. WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE TAX AVOIDING BRITISH RHETORIC
AND IT CANNOT BE RIGHT THAT ONE AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE MAKING MILLIONS OUT OF SOLICITING TAX PUDDINGS WHICH DOESN'T JUST THE PRIDE FOR THE BRITISH EXCHEQUER IT'S PART A LOT OF CUTS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH A TIBETAN THEY SHOULD GET BUT THEY'RE ALSO MAKING MILLIONS OUT OF CONTRACTS
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND I WOULD OBVIOUSLY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE LAW SICK TO STOP THAT HAPPENING HAVE YOU PUT A NUMBER ON IT HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE SCALE OF THESE CONTRACTS IT'S VERY HARD TO GET THE FIGURES OUT OF INK OF THE DEPARTMENT'S TUSSLE DEVELOPMENT BUT WE KNOW THERE'S A GENERAL PROBLEM WITH DIFFERED WITH MONEY GOING TO PRIVATE COMPANIES AND WITHIN THAT FOR TOO MUCH MONEY IN MY VIEW IS GOING TO BE BIG FOR ACCOUNTANTS DO YOU BELIEVE THIS WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON WHAT YOU'RE OPPOSED TO WHICH IS TAX AVOIDANCE BECAUSE
SURELY WHAT MIGHT WELL HAPPEN HE'S JUST A DIFFERENT SEVEN ADVISERS WOULD ADVISE PEOPLE HOW TO SHIELD THEIR MONEY IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS ARE ELSEWHERE YOU KNOW DO YOUR CASE AT THE EPICENTRE OF THE TAX AVOIDANCE INDUSTRY AND WE NEED TO BEAR DOWN ON IT IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WEIGHTS TRANSPARENCIES ABSOLUTELY KEY BUT I BELIEVE THE APPROPRIATE THAT COULD FALL ON THE BIG FULL UP TO NOW HAVE A VOID A LOT OF SCRUTINY IN THEIR ROLE IN TAX AVOIDANCE MIGHT ENCOURAGE THEM
TO IMPROVE THEIR WAY IS THIS AN APPROACH THAT OTHER PEOPLE WHO HOPE TO BE MINISTERS UNDER JEREMY CORBIN IF HE BECOMES PRIME MINISTER WILL ADOPTED THE WHOLE OF THE LABOUR CABINET ARE TARGETING THE BIG FALL AT LA MANO SURELY IF YOU MEAN IT THEY SHOULD LOOK AT ALL MY JOBS INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PICK IT UP I AM VERY STRUCK THAT TOO MUCH MONEY IS GOING OUT OR DIFFERED
TO PRIVATE COS YOU'RE OLD SENSES HE'S THE REASON I ASK MONEY IT'S GOING TO THESE THESE BIG FOUR ACCOUNTS YOU SERVED UNDER ED MILIBAND WHEN HE WAS LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY AND AS YOU WELL KNOW PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPERS PROVIDED ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO THE LABOUR PARTY AT THAT TIME AND INDEED THEY SECONDED ADVISORS TO THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR TO THE SHED OR BUSINESS SECRETARY TO THE SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY IN YOUR OWN COLLEAGUE ANGELA EAGLE SO WHY WERE YOU PREPARED TO SIT ROUND THE TABLE WHEN THEY WERE DOING THEN
WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW I HAVE THE THING ON THE TABLE I WAS A LOWLY JUNIOR MINISTER NOW WHOEVER YOU WERE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH GUY I WAS NOT SITTING ON THE TABLE I AM A MEMBER OF THE SHADOW CABINET I'M VERY CLEAR AS FAR AS MY RESPONSE THE CONSENT IT CANNOT BE RIGHT THAT PEOPLE ARE RESPONSE PEOPLE THE BIG FOR ACCOUNTANTS WHO ARE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE
PUNCH IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH LOSING SO MUCH TAX REVENUE BUT NEVER AT ALL I MAKE MONEY OUT OF DE NEVER BEFORE AS DIANE ABBOTT COME ON A PROGRAMME SO YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT TO ADVISE ANYBODY ELSE FIRST TALK ABOUT MYSELF YOU WOULD SAY I ASSUME TO YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SHADOW CABINET
DON'T TAKE MONEY FROM THE BIG FOUR DON'T GIVE THEM CONTRACTS WE ARE PULLING OUT NO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS TAKING MONEY I'M TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF POUNDS HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THEM BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ONE LAST QUESTION ON A DIFFERENT SUBJECT OF HER WE DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR SUBJECT BUT YOUR COLLEAGUE THE SHADOW CULTURE SECRETARY HAD SAID THIS MORNING THAT JOHN WISHING DEL THE CULTURE SECRETARY SHOULD IN THE TECHNICAL LANGUAGE RECUSE HIMSELF FROM HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH PRESS REGULATION GIVEN THE STORY THAT IS RUNNING THIS MORNING
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT IN YOUR VIEW THAT THIS MINISTER PULLS ASIDE FROM PRESS REGULATION IT'S LONG BEEN MY VIEW THAT WHICH ENGULF A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MURDOCH PRESS MADE HIM AN UNSUITABLE PERSON TO BE INVOLVED AND PRESS REGULATION BUT I WOULD PREFER NOT TO COMMENT ON JOHN TOWELS PRIVATE
BUT YOUR SHADOW CULTURE SECRETARY IS DOING JUST THAT BY SAYING YOU SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF THERE ARE REASONS WHY HE SHOULDN'T BE INVOLVED IN PRESS REGULATION AND THAT THOSE IS LONG HISTORY OF HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MURDOCHS BUT I DON'T CHOOSE TO COMMENT ON HIS PRIVATE LIFE SO TO BE CLEAR YOU DON'T WANT TO REGULATE THE PRESS BUT YOU'RE NOT JOINING YOUR COLLEAGUE AND SAYING SHOULD REDUCE
I THINK THE SILENCES SO I'VE NEVER HEARD A DIET ADVERTISER BDD EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR IT AND THE LAUGH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED DINER
THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE AN ARMY FIGHTING FOR ITS IMPERIAL MASTER JUST AS ITS COUNTRY'S BID FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM THAT MASTER WAS IN ITS FINAL STAGE THAT WAS THE POSITION OF THE INDIAN ARMY DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE ALLIED EFFORT WAS IMMENSE INCLUDING AGAINST THE JAPANESE AND IN A NEW BOOK THE INDIAN HISTORIAN THREE NOW THE REIGER BAND CONNECTS THE WAR EFFORT TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT HOME WITH THE FREEDOM MOVEMENT
HE'S IN A DEADLY STUDIO NOW AND WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO HERE BY JOHN DOUGLAS SLIM WHOSE FATHER VISCOUNT SLIM COMMANDED THE FOURTEENTH ARMY IN BURMA GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MONET STREUTH RUGGER AND WHAT WAS THE CONNECTION THEN BUT BETWEEN WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THESE TWO FRONT AT THE SAME TIME HOW DID HOW DID THE INDEPENDENCE LEADERS FEEL ABOUT THEIR WAR EFFORT
WELL IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ART INDIAN NATIONALISTS WERE NOT THERE HAVE BEEN IN THAT'S NOT ASKED FOR RENDER VICEROY LORD LIVE GOB DECIDED TO TAKE INDIA TO WAR SO LOT OF THE NATIONALIST OPINION ESPECIALLY THE DOMINANT INDIAN NATIONAL CLUNG SPOTTY
WAS QUITE MIFFED AT THAT ARM NOT BEEN CONSULTED BUT NEVERTHELESS AS THE WAR SORT OF DREW INDIA FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO IT ARE IN THE MILLIONS OF INDIAN PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES SIGNING UP IN THE INDIAN ARMY OFFERING ALL OTHER KINDS OF MILITARY AND CIVILIAN LABOUR TO SUPPORT THE WAR EFFORT AND A NUMBER OF OTHER SORT OF POLITICAL FORCES IN THE COUNTRY APART FROM THE CONGRESS ACTUALLY CAME ROUND TO GIVE INGRID IN DEGREES OF SUPPORT TO THE BRITISH WAR WATERFORD BUT WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT
WELL I MEAN A LOT OF THEM SOLID AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSERT THEIR CLAIMS OF THEIR OWN COMMUNITY LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE STALWART LEADER OF THE SO CALLED UNTOUCHABLES WAS A MAN CALLED B. R. AND BID GO WHO WAS DRAFTED INTO THE WISE CHOICE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AS THE LABOUR MEMBER SO HE WAS EFFECTIVELY USED TO MOBILISE THE SO CALLED UNTOUCHABLES WERE OUTSIDE THE INDIAN CASTE SYSTEM
FOR THE WAR EFFORT AND HE SAW THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A KIND OF SOCIAL MOBILITY FOR HIS ON COMMUNITY AND A LOT OF THEM DID COME FORWARD NOT ONLY TO FIGHT THE SOLDIERS NOT TO ACT AS LABOURERS COMPETENCE OR NON COMBATANTS AND IN AND IN THE NUMBER OF WEIGHTS AND MUCH THE SAME WAS THE CASE WITH OTHER GROUPS ARE GROUPS ON THE HINDU RIDE THE PAKISTAN MOMENT LED BY JIM I GAVE HIM THE SORT OF AND IT WAS SUPPORT ARE TO THE WAR EFFORT AS WELL
CLINT DO YOU THINK THAT AS WE LOOK AND WE'RE PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT AT THE MOMENT WITH THEM ANNIVERSARIES AS WE LOOK AT THE SECOND WORLD WAR AS A WHOLE DO WE UNDER APPRECIATE THE ROLE THAT THE INDIAN ARMY PLATE I THINK SOME PEOPLE WHO I THINK IT WAS THE GREATEST WORLD WAR TWO TWO AND A HALF MILLION
ALL THE MARTIAL RACES INDIA AND OTHERS AND I THINK THE WAR WOULD HAVE GONE MUNCH LONGER IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE INDIAN ARMY
THEY FOUGHT IN THE DESERT IN THE MIDDLE IS IN ITALY IN SINGAPORE MALAYA HONG KONG A GREAT ARMY AND I HOPE THAT HMM I THINK THAT ARMY IN INDIA IS STILL A VERY GREAT ARMY AND ITS GREAT ARMOUR WAS SOMEONE LIKE ME
DIDN'T YOU SAY SO MAN YEAH DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER EVER WORRIED ABOUT THE THE LOYALTY OF THE TROOPS UNDER HIM IN A GIVEN THAT THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THEM MIGHT HAVE BEEN NATIONALISTS SCENT AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE OF THE INDEPENDENTS CALLS AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR THE BRITISH UNDER HIM YES I THINK NO WAY OR WITH THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEN MY FATHER WORLDS AND THEN FOR THIRTY YEARS NO ONE HAD MORE AFFECTION
NO ONE THAT'S MORE THAN MY FATHER AND I THINK ANYONE WHO SERVED IN THE END I HAD NOTHING BUT ADMIRATION AND AFFECTION AND WERE PROUD TO HAVE SERVED IN IT THREE IN A THREAD OF AND YOU YOU YOU WROTE AT ONE POINT GOOD BY THE END OF THE WAR THAT THE BRITISH HAD LOST THE SUPPORT OF THE INDIAN ARMY
BUT WHAT I MEANT BY THAT WAS TO SAY THAT THERE BY THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR BECAUSE THE INDIAN ARMY WAS EXPANDED TO SUCH LARGE PROPORTIONS IT WENT FROM BEING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND JUST BEFORE THE WAR BEGAN TO TWO AND A HALF MILLION ALL INDIA FORCE SO YOU NATURALLY HAD AN EXPANSION BEYOND TRADITIONAL MARTIAL CLASSES ON WHICH THEN GET ON ARMY DEPENDENT AND MANY OF THE NEW PEOPLE WHO CAME AND WERE A POLITICALLY ATTUNED WERE A NATIONALIST IN THEIR SYMPATHIES
AND ALL OF THEM ARE VERY CLEAR THAT WHILE THEY WERE FIGHTING ON THE SIDE OF THE ALLIES ALSO HOPE THAT SUPPORT FOR THE WAR EFFORT WOULD ACTUALLY LEAD TO INDIAN INDEPENDENCE AND BY NINETEEN FORTY SIX WHEN THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT UNDER ATTLEE COMES TO POWER IN BRITAIN IT WAS QUITE CLEAR THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER THINK OF THE INDIAN ARMY AS THE SAME OLD INSTRUMENT OFTEN PETER AND CONTROL IN INDIA
IN THE WAY THAT SEE YOU TODD BUT AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND BEFORE THAT AS WELL SO IT WAS THAT THAT REALLY SAID THE STATE WEARING INDEPENDENT DO YOU MEAN IN THE SENSE THAT THEY HAD DONE THEIR BIT FOR THE BRITISH SAID REALLY PROVED THEY'VE DONE THEIR BIT FOR THE BRITISH AND NOW THAT INDEPENDENCE WAS PART OF THE OBVIOUS WHAT THEY WANTED IN RETURN YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT WAS QUITE CLEAR YOU'RE IN THE WAY THAT EVEN THE SOLDIERS OF THE INDIAN ARMY WHO WERE LOYAL TO THE BRITISH RAJ TO LOOK AT TILL THE WAR LASTED
CAME OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL ARMY WHICH HAD ACTUALLY SORT OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAD FOUGHT UNDER SOME OSMOSIS LEADERSHIP WITH THE JAPANESE SO WHAT YOU SAW WAS THIS EXTRAORDINARY SORT OF SITUATION IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX MEN ARE SOLDIERS OF THE INDIAN ARMY WHO WOULD FOUGHT ON THE ALLIED SIDE ACTUALLY CAME OUT AND SAID THAT THOSE WHO HAD FOUGHT ON THE JAPANESE SIDE SHOULD NOT BE TRIED AND THAT THEY WERE AS MUCH PATRIOTS AS AS THE OTHERS WERE SO
A LITTLE SLIM I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT IN THE SINK IT WAS PART OF WHAT HAPPENED IT WAS A MINORITY OF INDIAN ARMY SOLDIERS WHO WHO THROUGH UNDER JAPANESE INFLUENCE DID FORM THIS OTHER FALSE WHICH WHICH WAS GOING TO FIGHT ON WELL SAW SWIRLS FORM BY THE JAPANESE AND FOR FIRST THING THE JAPANESE DEAD ON THE CAPTURE OF MANY INDIAN SOLDIERS MALAYA SINGAPORE
THEY REMOVE THE OFFICERS FROM THE MEN AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO
STUCK IN WROTE PROPAGANDA AND TO THE MAN I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG IN INDIAN WANTING INDEPENDENCE WE ALL SAID INDIA WILL HAVE ITS INDEPENDENCE BUT LET'S WIN THE WALL FIRST AND I DON'T GET HIT AND FOG WITH THE CHANDRA BOSE HERE SHOW A LOT OF INDIANS I KNOW CALL HIM A TRAITOR
