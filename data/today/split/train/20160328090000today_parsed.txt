MORNING NINA SENT UP IN BEIRUT TANKS IT WAS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX IN BRUSSELS THEY HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE DEMONSTRATING NOT JUST AGAINST TERRORISM BUT AGAINST MUSLIMS

THEY LOOK LIKE MOROCCAN CHILDREN PLACED IN BELGIUM FLAGS ON ON THIS CARPET OF FLOWERS AND CANDLES AND THEN SUDDENLY THIS GANG OF MEN
ONE HUNDRED OF THEM ALL THE AGENCIES ARE REPORTING WERE UP TO FOUR HUNDRED TRAMPLED ACROSS THE CARCASS OF TRIBUTES TOOK TO THE STAIRS AND THEN STARTED RUNNING AROUND THE CROWED TRYING TO SEARCH MUSLIM WOMEN AND THEN SHOUTING IN THEIR FACES POINTING IN THEIR FACES
IT WAS MOSTLY NON VIOLENT BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WAS HUGELY INTIMIDATING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED AND I DID SEE TWO JOURNALISTS BEING ATTACKED AND THE TALK OF NAZI SALUTES OF THAT SORT OF THING AS WELL
IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY WERE NAZI SALUTES WE'VE HAD ALL HIS BACK AT THE FOOTAGE THOUGH AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THEY ARE JUST PUNCHING THEIR FISTS IN THE AIR SO THEY CALLED THEMSELVES FOOTBALL HOOLIGANS OR CASUALS AGAINST TERRORISM TERRORISM BUT THERE
ACTION CERTAINLY SUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE AGAINST MUSLIMS AND YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE SEEN THE PICTURES THE WATER CANNONS WERE BROUGHT IN THE RIOT POLICE MANAGED TO PUSH THEM BACK DOWN THE ROAD
AND THIS IS OF COURSE AFTER THE AUTHORITIES ASKED THE ORGANISERS OF A PEACEFUL MARCH AGAINST FEAR WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE YESTERDAY NOT TO GO AHEAD WITH THAT BECAUSE THEY SAID THE POLICE FORCES WERE TO STRETCH WITH THE ANTI TERROR OPERATIONS TO COVER ANYTHING ELSE AND THERE HAVE BEEN ANOTHER THIRTEEN RAIDS ACROSS BRUSSELS AND TWO TONES JUST TO THE NORTH OF HERE ON SUNDAY

SO PEOPLE MISLED BY FIVE FIVE FIVE NINE IN ENOUGH TO TO PLAY DARKNESS ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH CONTENT TO SATISFY THOSE WANTING TO USE THESE HEADSETS ABSOLUTELY NOT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CAME OUT WITH A BUNDLE WILL THE LUCKY ESTELLE GAME AS WELL AS THE BELL CAN WE GAIN THEY REALISED THAT THERE IS ENOUGH COMMERCIAL QUA GIGS OUT THERE
LET'S TURN TO YOU PAUL IS IT A QUESTION WITH THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES OF GRABBING MARKET SHARE AT THE RIGHT BEGIN RIGHT AT THE START IS THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING FIRST TO DEGREE I MEAN THE KEY THING ASIDE FROM THEIR HEADS IT'S THEMSELVES IS
HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO GET THAT CONTENT THOSE GAMES THOSE VIDEOS OWNING THE APP STORE HAS PROVEN TO BE SO IMPORTANT FOR THE SMART FOR MANUFACTURERS SO GETTING IN THERE AND IN THE PLATFORM THAT YOU GET YOUR GAME ALL YOU'LL BE OUR EXPERIENCE FROM
ALMOST REGARDLESS OF THE HEADSET IT IS WHAT A LOT OF THESE FIRMS ARE TRYING TO DO IT HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE I'VE SEEN YOUR HEADSETS BEFORE SIR WHY'S OCULUS DIFFERENT
YOU MEAN NINETEEN NINETIES WE A HEADSET I'LL BE FAR FAR SUPERIOR BASICALLY THE TECHNOLOGY HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH OUR ASPIRATIONS FOR HOW THESE THINGS SHOULD BEHAVE IT REALLY IS AN IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE BOTH THE GAMING AND FOUR FOUR

IT DOES ADD TO THE GENERAL DIRECTION BUT ABSORBING CONTENT IS GOING AT WAS IT SEEMS TO BE A SORT OF ONE ON ONE EXPERIENCE NOT NECESSARILY A GROUP EXPERIENCE WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT IT IS A BIT MORE YEAH I MEAN IT THIS IS REALLY IMMERSIVE VIEW ONE OF THE REASONS YOU DON'T USE THESE DEVICES FOR MUCH LONGER
TWENTY MINUTES HALF AN HOUR IS YOU START TO GET FAIRLY LONELY AND WONDERING WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING IN THE ROOM YOU'RE IN COS YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA RIGHT SO THAT IS QUITE A MERCIFUL WHAT YOU SEE WITH SOME OF THE CHEAPER DEVICES LIKE GOOGLE CARDBOARD OR SOME OF THESE VERY SMALL PORTABLE DEVICES IT IS YOU CAN SHARE THEM ROUND A ROOM
THE EXPERIENCE IS NOT QUITE AS GOOD BUT AT LEAST IT CHERYL PETER I'VE ALSO HEARD OF SOMETHING CALLED AUGMENTED REALITY WHEREBY YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE REAL WORLD IT CAN SUPERIMPOSE IMAGES ON THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S TAKING OFF
IN FACT NOW WE HAVE MANY ENQUIRIES ASKING US TO HAVE TO HELP THEM TO DO A LOT OF CONTENT
ART MEANT IT WE ARE LEAD BY NATURE IS SHOULD LIVE MEDIO DE PROGRAMMING UNITY OR AN ENGINE THAT YOU'LL KEN MIN THE POLI THE V.A.T. UP TO BECOME A IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S WHAT WE DONE LAST YEAR WE CALL DO YOU WANT A GAME USING SIXTY WHEEDLE CAMERA
HE CAME OUT LAST YEAR LAST ARGOS BUT THEN THERE WAS JUST AN EXPERIMENTAL GAME WILL IT LAST ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES BUT THEN WE REALISED THAT PETER WAS CONCENTRATIONS ARE SHRINKING PETER YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU WELL WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ON THE MARKET'S NOT A GREAT DEAL OBVIOUSLY OVER EASTER WEEKEND DAVID
HE'S STILL WITH US HE'S FROM GORDON THERE HAS BEEN ITS SCENES IN THAT VOID OF TRADING INCREASED CONCERN ABOUT THIS PROPOSED MERGER BETWEEN THE DODGER BAUZA AND LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE
A MERGER OF EQUALS BUT NOT REALLY AS WHAT HAVE PEOPLE IT EXACTLY RIGHT TURN A GOOD MORTGAGE YOU NO SUCH THING AS WOULD MERGER OF EQUALS EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT SALFORD TOO BUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE THERE WAS A PERIOD BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE
AND TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WHEN DAME CARTER FIRST WAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE LORD LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE WHERE THE ONLY MAJOR DEAL THAT HAPPENED APART FROM NURSE TO SHARE PRICE UP FROM FIVE POUNDS TO TWENTY POUNDS WAS THE ACQUISITION OF BALSA ITALIANA WE DIDN'T TAKE LONDON TO THE REST OF THE WORLD WE DIDN'T BRING LONDON THE REST THE WORLD TO LONDON
SINCE THEN XAVIER RAWLEY HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB HE WOULD RETIRE BY THE WAY HE WOULD HAVING SURRENDERED SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY PER CENT OF THE TURNOVER TO OTHER PLATFORMS MY STERNUM AND PHENOMENAL JOB AND SEEING THAT SHARE PRICE UP FROM SIX POUNDS TO TIP DAVID LET ME INTERRUPT YOU WHAT IS THIS GOT TO DO WITH OUR SOVEREIGNTY THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE IS SO SURELY JUST A COMPANY IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN THAT NO I HAVE TWO PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE WITH YOU AND THE REASON WHY IS
MARKETS WILL GO GLOBAL AND THERE'S NO QUESTION OF THIS LONDON AS THE CENTRE OF THE TIMES ENGLISH AS THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN THE ACCOUNTS A PROFESSION IS ALSO THE SENTRIES IN LONDON THEREFORE TO MOST PEOPLE IT IS FUNDAMENTAL THAT WHATEVER DEAL IS DONE WITH THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE THE LONDON IS THE PLACE THAT THE BUSINESS IS DONE NOT FRANKFORT FRANKFORT IS QUITE A SMALL MARKET IN COMPARISON TO LONDON THEREFORE IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF RULE BRITANNIA ALL THE UNION JACK IT'S A QUESTION OF
PRAGMATISM FOR BUSINESS O.K. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT GET A COUPLE OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE GOING IN THE SPOTLIGHT THIS WEEK PREMIER FOODS IS ONE THING ONE OF THEM HOLDING OUT FOR A BETTER OFFER IT'S BEEN TALKING TAKE OVER AS WELL WITH MCCORMICK FROM THE UNITED STATES BUT THE SHAREHOLDERS AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT AND ALSO A.G. BAR THAT'S GOING TO BE REPORTING THIS WEEK AND OF COURSE THAT'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT PRODUCES IRON BREW WHICH IS A SUGARY DRINK
AS AS HIS TIES AROUSES ORANGEY LET'S DO INITIALLY WITH AGEE BARS YOU SAY THEY REPORT TOMORROW
THE FACT REMAINS AS THAT'S ALL GOING TO BE ABOUT THE SUGAR TAXES AND THE SUGAR TAX IN POINT OF FACT HE'S NOT REALLY GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED FOR TWO YEARS FROM WAS SAYING AT THE BUDGET BUT HE THOUGHT IT WOULD RAISE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION POUNDS I SUSPECT IT WON'T BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF THESE DRINKS COMPANIES ARE ON NOTICE TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THE SUGAR CONTENT OF THESE THINGS AND I SUSPECT IF YOU AND I HAD A CONVERSATION IN TWO YEARS' TIME A LOT OF THEM WILL BE SOMEWHERE
SO IT IS A TEMPORARY PROBLEM FOR THEM BUT THE SHARE PRICE ARE LOOKED UP TO SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE BRUSH IT WAS HARD AND THE U.K. IS NOT THE ONLY MARKET FOR THOSE DRINKS ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED DAVID B. EIGHT FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING WE SPOKEN QUITE A BIT ON THIS PROGRAMME ABOUT TECH FERN'S CHANGING THE WORLD'S BANKING AND RETAIL BUT WE HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH ABOUT THEM TAKING ON THE PROPERTY SECTOR
BUT THERE ARE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF TECH UP START TECH START UPS EVEN AIMING TO DISRUPT EVERYTHING FROM ESTATE AGENTS TO MORTGAGE PROVIDERS WON'T PROVIDE AS ONE OF THEM IS THE MORTGAGE ADVISER TRUSS ALL ITS FOUNDER HE SHUN MALE JOINS US NOW IN THE STUDIO WELCOME TO YOU SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT WHAT YOU DO FROM ANY ANY SERVICE ONLINE LET'S PUT THE BANK'S OUT OF IT FOR THE TIME BEING WHEREBY YOU GO DIRECTLY TO A BANK
MORNING FIRSTLY I THINK THE MAIN THING THAT'S DIFFERENT WITH US IS THE OBVIOUS ONE IS WEARING ONLINE PROCESS SO THERE'S THE ABILITY TO PICK UP ANY DEVICE THAT'S CONNECTED TO THE WEB FILL IN WHAT COULD BE A VERY SHORT MORTGAGE APPLICATION IN TEN MINUTES
AND I THINK IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET WHAT'S WHAT'S THE REAL DIFFERENTIATED BETWEEN ASS IN THE TRADITIONAL MODELS IS THE FAT OF A ONGOING MORTGAGE MANAGEMENT
THE MORTGAGE THAT YOU HAVE AT THE OUTSET IS UNLIKELY TO BE THE RIGHT ONE FOR YOU IN IN TWO THREE YEARS' TIME TRUSS ALL TAKES THAT WORRY AWAY BY CONTINUALLY CHECKING AND MONITORING YOUR MORTGAGE FOR YOU AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS ON THE BEST SO THAT IS THE DYNAMIC THAT WE FEEL THAT IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN THE CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRON PEOPLE PROBABLY NEED SWAP MORTGAGES MORE FREQUENTLY AND THAT IS THE PREMISE ON WHICH YOU'VE STARTED THIS COMPANY
ABSOLUTELY AND AN ACTRESS YESTERDAY USWITCH PUBLISHER STUDY HE SAID THE ONE IN THREE MORTGAGE HOLDERS ARE LOSING AROUND THREE THOUSAND POUNDS BY FAILING TO SWITCH THEIR MORTGAGE WHEN THEY EXPIRE ON A NATIONWIDE SCALE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TENS OF BILLIONS OF POUNDS SIMPLY DUE TO A LACK OF AWARENESS OR EDUCATION AND TRUST WAS BUILT ON THE PREMISE THAT WE CAN SAVE PEOPLE MONEY AND THAT AWARENESS AND EDUCATION TO ME NOT NEED ADVICE WHEN IT COMES TO MORTGAGES
ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT'S THAT THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE IMPORTANT COMPONENT YOU YOU MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THEY SHOULD BE SWITCHING AND THEN WE'RE THE ONES PROVIDING THE ADVICE FOR IT IN THE MOST KIND OF CONVENIENT WAY HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY SO LIKE ALL ADVISERS WE GENERALLY FLAT PROCLAMATION FEE FROM THE LENDER HOWEVER UNLIKE MOST ADVISORS WE DON'T CHOOSE TO CHARGE IN ADVICE FEE TO THE CONSUMERS

PAKISTAN THE HEART OF LAHORE THE SAME GROUP HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FOREIGN ATTACK ABOUT A MONTH AGO THAT WAS A NORTH WESTERN PAKISTAN NEAR THE TRIBAL AREAS AN AREA
NORMALLY QUITE UNSTABLE BUT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO CAUSE THAT KIND OF DAMAGE ON A DEVASTATING SCALE IN THE FOREST
OF LOUGHOR THE MAIN CONSTITUENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL PARTY IT'S QUITE A WORRYING DEVELOPMENT WHAT ELSE THEY CAN ACHIEVE AND THE KIND OF DAMAGE THEY CAN
THEY COULD INFLICT ON DIFFERENT CITIES IN PAKISTAN BUT BUT WHY IF ONE TRIES TO ASCRIBE REASON OF THIS SORT OF INSANITY WHY WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO TARGET KRISTIAN'S IN PARTICULAR
BUT THIS IS THE QUESTION OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN ASKING
FOR DECADES NOW JOHN THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT PAKISTAN'S CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN HIT AND HIT QUITE TRAGICALLY I REMEMBER A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO I WAS IN LAHORE REPORTING ON YET ANOTHER ATTACK ON SUNDAY MASS OR A SUICIDE BOMBER
HE'D HAVE A CHURCH AND ONE OF THE WHORES BIGGEST KRISTIAN NEIGHBOURHOODS AND AT THE TIME MANY LEADERS IN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY WERE ASKING ME WHY ARE THE AUTHORITIES NOT DOING ENOUGH TO PROTECT US
AND IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTY PEOPLE DIED IN A CHURCH IN THE SHOWER SO THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY OF LONG COMPLAINED THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABANDONED BY SECURITY FORCES ABANDONED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHILE THERE HE CONTINUED TO BE TARGETED
BYE BYE EXTREMIST BY MILITANTS AND THIS ATTACK IS GOING TO RAISE YET MORE QUESTION AND MORE ANGER AND WHY THE AUTHORITIES YET AGAIN A FAILING TO PROTECT PAKISTAN'S RELIGIOUS MINORITIES TREMOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST HAS ACCUSED THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF SKEWING ITS FUNDING OF RESEARCH ON MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTIVELY BEING BIASED ON FIELD AND THAT SCIENCE EDITOR AND BIASED IN WHAT DIRECTION TOM THIS IS LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR RICHARD BENTALL WHO IS ONE OF A GROUP OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST WHO REALLY BECOME INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED BY WHAT THEY CLAIM IS THIS OVER EMPHASIS ON ON BIOLOGY ON NEUROSCIENCE AND GENETICS AND THE BASIC
BIO CHEMISTRY AT IF YOU LIKE OF DISEASE WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING RESEARCH INVESTIGATING THE CAUSES AND POTENTIAL TREATMENTS FOR MENTAL ILLNESS THEY WANT TO SEE MORE MONEY GOING ON THAT DEVELOPING BETTER PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES THOSE THAT COULD HELP PATIENTS THEMSELVES TO DEVELOP BETTER STRATEGIES TO COPE WITH THE DAMAGING LIFE EVENTS THEY BELIEVE THE REAL CAUSE OF THEIR PROBLEMS AND THEIR MA SEE THEY BELIEVE OR WHAT IN THERE
PAY OF THE DRUG COMPANIES WHAT'S WHAT'S WHY WOULD THE M. R. C. NOT GO JUST IN THE DIRECTION THAT SCIENCE TOOK THEM WELL RICHARD PENTEL ON TELL YOU WHAT WHAT'S AT THE HEART OF THIS IS A ROW ABOUT THE NATURE OF MENTAL ILLNESS ITSELF WHETHER IT'S A BIO CHEMICAL
ILLNESS THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY MEASURE IN THE BRAIN AND THEN CORRECT WITH A LOT OF SPENDING ON MACHINES THAT GO PING AS AS HE PUTS IT OR WHETHER IT IS THE RESPONSE TO LIFE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ABUSE BULLYING THOSE KIND THAT'S INTERESTING SO HE THINKS THAT THE AIR MA SI HAVE TAKEN A VIEW ON WHAT MENTAL
ILLNESS IS FUNDAMENTALLY AND WHERE THE POSSIBILITIES ARE THAT IT COULD BE BUT SERIOUSLY ADDRESSED AND THAT REVIEW IS THEN SKEWING THE PLACE THAT THEY PUT THEM UP HERE AT ITS HEART IS THIS FUNDAMENTAL ARGUMENT IF YOU LIKE ABOUT WHAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS REALLY ABOUT BUT I HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN PROFESSION WHO ARE NOT CONVINCED BY THIS ARGUMENT THEY THINK HE'S HE'S RATHER PUSHING A BIT OF A STRAW MAN HERE AND THAT IN ACTUAL FACT IT'S CLEARLY A COMBINATION
OF BOTH IT'S BOTH OF THOSE FIZZY THE PHYSICAL ILLNESS IN THE BRAIN THE BIOCHEMISTRY WHICH MIGHT PUT HER GIVE YOU A PRE DISPOSITION BUT IT'S ALSO
THE KIND OF FACTORS THAT BOTH THE SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS SO HOW YOU REACT TO EVENTS IN YOUR LIFE BUT ALSO THOSE EVENTS THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN GO ALL THE WAY TO POVERTY BULLYING
AND IT BEATS BUT THE SOLUTION AS HE WOULD SAY IT IS WHAT CHANGED CHANGED THE DIRECTION OF THE OF THE M. R. C. WHICH I GUESS YOU WOULD DO BY ALTERING THE THE THE THE THE QUALIFICATIONS AND THINKING OF THE PEOPLE ARE ON IT I THINK WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THERE NEEDS TO BE A BIGGER EMPHASIS MORE INPUT INTO THIS THIS AREA OF PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY THAT THE M. M.I.C. C. SHOULD BE
THINKING ABOUT THAT MORE THAN IT IS AT THE MOMENT WHAT IT'S DOING AT THE MOMENT IS HE'S THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE HARDWARE IF YOU LIKE THE THE WET BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS IT NEEDS TO CONSIDER THESE OTHER ASPECTS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT AS WELL DECISIONS HAD TEN PAST THERE TOM FACTS
TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN BRAZIL SEEMS TO BE LURCHING FROM ONE CRISIS TO ANOTHER IT'S THE BIGGEST COUNTRY WITH THE BIGGEST ECONOMY OR LATIN AMERICA AND IT'S IN THE DEPTHS OF AN ECONOMIC RECESSION NOW IT'S PRESIDENT DEAL MURDEROUS SETH IS BATTLING ATTEMPTS TO IMPEACH HER BY A HOSTILE CONGRESS AS A BRAZIL CORRESPONDENT WOULD'VE DAVIS REPORT AFTER A DECADE OF GROWTH AND POSITIVE NEWS BRAZIL'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DIVISIONS ARE AGAIN BEING EXPOSED
THE PRIME BRAZIL'S EMBATTLED PRESIDENT DUMA SETH IS IN A BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT FOR HER POLITICAL
MY EYES
I'M NOT RESIGNING THERE WILL NOT BE A COUP SHE DECLARED DEFIANTLY THIS WEEK AS A WIDENING CORRUPTION SCANDAL THREATENED TO DERAIL HER GOVERNOR
THIS IS AN INCREASINGLY POLARISED COUNTRY THAT PRO GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS LAST WEEK IN CITIES FROM SAN PAOLO TO SALVADOR
THEY FOLLOWED EVEN BIGGER PROTESTS A FEW DAYS EARLIER CALLING FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENTS
THIS VEHEMENT ANTI GOVERNMENT SENTIMENT COMES BARELY A DECADE AFTER BRAZIL WAS THE DARLING OF THE DEVELOPING
ITS ECONOMY BOOMING AND PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL POLICIES HELPING TO ELEVATE MILLIONS OUT OF POVERTY
BUT A HUGE ANTI CORRUPTION PROBE KNOWN AS THE CARWASH INVESTIGATION HAS IMPLICATED SEVERAL SENIOR POLITICIANS AND TOP BUSINESS LEADERS
ONE OF THE LEAD PROSECUTORS BASED IN THE SOUTHERN CITY OF COULDA TUBA GAVE ME AN INDICATION OF THE SCALE OF THEIR INVESTIGATION GROW VERY HARMFUL TO PRESENT WE HAVE OUR MOULDS UP TRUE OR FORTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THESE WERE THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WHICH IS INVESTED IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM ARE IN THE OCCASIONAL SYSTEM AND WHAT ISN'T I SUPPOSE UNIQUE ABOUT THIS CASE IS THAT IT INVOLVES
SO MANY PEOPLE FROM BIG COMPANIES FROM FROM GOVERNMENT THAT DOESN'T PUT YOU OFF DOES IT
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY WE WERE ABLE TO PROSECUTE AT THE SAME TIME HOW LEVEL PUT IT LEVEL BUSINESS PEOPLE WITH STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THE WORK GROUP THAT IAN I'M ALCE WHICH GO UP TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
DETENTION IS FOCUSED ON FORMER PRESIDENT LULA
CHARISMATIC PREDECESSOR HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF DIRECTLY BENEFITING FROM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN KICKBACKS FROM SOME OF BRAZIL'S BIGGEST CONSTRUCTION FIRMS
LULA ANGRILY DENIES THE CHARGES SAYING THE PROSECUTORS ARE CONDUCTING A POLITICISE CRUSADE AGAINST THE LEFT WING WORKERS' PARTY GOVERNMENT
FOR S. A POLITICAL ANALYST FROM THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF RE EDITION SAYS THE CORRUPTION PROBE IS IMPORTANT BUT THE MAIN FLOORS I THINK ARE RELATED TO THE EXCESS OF AUTONOMY OF THE DID THIS BRAND AND ALSO OF INSTEAD OF POOR LIKKLE WHICH IS LIKE A GENERAL PROSECUTOR
SO WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THERE ARE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE A POLITICAL INTENT IN ALL THINGS CAN GO BAD AS THEIR GORE NOW BY RELEASING TRANSCRIPTS OF PHONE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN EX PRESIDENT LULA AND DUMA RECESS MANY BRAZILIANS HERE ON THE STREET SAY THE JUDGE IN CHARGE OF THE CASE OVERSTEPPED THE MARK
BUDGE SAYS CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER AN APOLOGY BUT TO SELL US AS DISRUPTIVE AS IT MIGHT BE NOW THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE GOOD FOR BRAZIL IN THE LONG RUN SEEMS LIKE A MARE BUT I THINK THAT WELL GAD HAVE TO
IT'S POSITIVE AND I THINK WE'LL HAVE A STRONGER BRAZIL
SOMBRE INSTITUTIONS AS CORRUPTION I WOULD EXPECT THAT
THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS IN CONGRESS AGAINST PRESIDENT RECESS MAY GATHER PACE OR SHE MAY SUCCEED IN FIGHTING HER WAY OUT OF IT BUT PERHAPS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO BRAZIL'S FUTURE IS IF THE ANTI CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS ARE WATERED DOWN OR EVEN SUSPENDED IN SUCH AN EVENTUALITY THE ONLY WINNERS WILL BE THE SAME POLITICAL AND BUSINESS ELITES WHO RULED THIS COUNTRY FOR DECADES
THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR LOOK AT THE PAPERS MANY DESCRIBE THOSE SCENES OF HORROR AND CHAOS FOLLOWING THE SUICIDE BOMBING TO PARK IN THE PAKISTANI CITY OF LAHORE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH POINTS OUT THAT THE DEADLY ATTACK HAPPEN JUST YARDS FROM A SET OF CHILDREN'S SWINGS ACCORDING TO THE MIRROR SCREAMING WOMEN AND CHILDREN LEFT STANDING IN POOLS OF BLOOD
AN EYE WITNESS TELLS THE DAILY MAIL WITH A STAMPEDE BROKE OUT AFTER THE BOMBING WITH CHILDREN BECOMING SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THE RUSH TO SAFETY IT WAS A SOFT TARGET A SENIOR POLICE OFFICIAL SAYS THE VICTIMS WERE INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN THE GUARDIAN SAYS MANY PEOPLE WERE STILL SEARCHING FOR LOVED ONES LATER INTO HER LAST NIGHT IT HIGHLIGHTS THE CLAIM BY A SPLINTER GROUP OF THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN THEY DID HAD DELIBERATELY TARGETED LOVELL'S CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY GUARDIAN SAYS MANY CHRISTIANS IN PAKISTAN BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T DOING ENOUGH TO PROTECT THEM
FUSES POLITICIANS BEING QUICK TO OFFER CONDOLENCES AFTER AN ATTACK BUT SLOW TO TAKE REAL ACTION THERE SAID HE SAVED IT FOR THE WORLD IS A NEW DAY DESCRIBED THE RECAPTURE FROM SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE MILITANT OF THE ANCIENT SYRIAN CITY OF PALMYRA PALMYRA PERHAPS IT IS THE TIMES SAYS IT'S BEEN SEEN AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEFEAT FOR ISIS SINCE THE GROUP'S FORMATION CALLING THE GUARD IN THE RECAPTURE
THE MIRROR REPRESENTS A MAJOR MORALE BOOST FOR THE EMBATTLED SYRIAN REGIME AND ALSO FOR THE KREMLIN HAS TURNED THE CITY INTO POTENTIAL STEPPING POINT FOR OFFENSIVES AGAINST ISIS HELD TERRITORY IN EASTERN
THERE ARE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE LITTLE GIRL SEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL SUMMER GROUND WHO WAS KILLED AT A FUNFAIR IN ESSEX IN MOST OF THE PAPERS THE BOUNCY CASTLE THAT SHE WAS IN BLEW AWAY THE MIRROR THE SUN AND THE MAIL ALL OF HER PICTURES OFF HER RECORDING THE TELEGRAPH QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED AS TO WHY THE INFLATABLE WAS ALLOWED ON A WEEKEND WHEN GALE FORCE WINDS HAVE BEEN FORECAST THE SHOWMAN'S GUILD OF GREAT BRITAIN
TOLD THE TELEGRAPH THE BOUNCY CASTLE WAS CAUGHT IN A FREAK GUST OF WIND STORM CHAOS TO HIT BRITAIN IS THE MAIN HEADLINE IN THE DAILY EXPRESS IT PREDICTS TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS HAVE BROUGHT BY STORM KATIE COULD CAUSE TRAVEL MISERY DURING TODAY'S BANK HOLIDAY IF YOU'VE BEEN UP EARLY ALL THAT PARTICULAR IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY OR ALREADY BE WELL AWARE OF THIS THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE MIRROR SHOWING THE QUEEN AND PRINCESS ANNE CLUTCHING THEIR HATS AS THEY WALK TO AN EASTER SERVICE YESTERDAY
IMAGES OF THE CAMBRIDGE WOMEN'S BOAT RACE CRUISE STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT AMID CHOPPY CONDITIONS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE GUARDIAN THE TELEGRAPH THE TIMES AS WELL ALL THREE OPTING FOR THE SAME HEADLINE THAT SINKING AND THE TELEGRAPH I LIKE TO CALL BY A SENIOR OFFICER FOR THE POLICE RECRUITMENT AGE TO BE LOADED TO SIXTEEN IN ORDER TO HELP TACKLE THE CHANGING NATURE OF CRIME HE IS GAVIN THOMAS WHO'S THE POLICE OBVIOUSLY TAKES OVER AS PRESIDENT OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS ASSOCIATION THIS WEEK
AND HE THINKS THAT SCHOOL LEAVERS COULD PROVE MORE ADEPT AT FIGHTING SOME CYBER CRIME AND SOCIAL MEDIA OFFENCES THAN OLDER POLICE OFFICERS THE SCARF AND THE TELEGRAPH THINKS IT'S A GOOD IDEA IT SAYS IT WOULD STRIKE A BLOW AGAINST THE RELENTLESS DRIVE BY MANY PROFESSIONS TO ACQUIRE NEW RECRUITS TO COMPLETE A UNIVERSITY DEGREE FIRST NOT ONLY THAT IT SAYS IT WOULD CONFIRM THAT WE WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG
WE'RE NOT GETTING OLDER IT'S THE POLICEMEN AND WOMEN WHO REALLY ARE GETTING YOUNGER
IT IS FOURTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING A TALIBAN SPLINTER GROUP ARE SAID IT CARRIED OUT A SUICIDE BOMB ATTACK IN THE PAKISTANI CITY OF LAHORE WHICH KILLED AT LEAST SEVENTY PEOPLE MANY OF THEM CHILDREN SAID IT DIDN'T DELIBERATELY TARGETED THE CITY'S CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY
HE PREVENT POLICY IS MEANT TO STOP PEOPLE BEING DRAWN INTO TERRORISM BUT DOES IT WORK WITH CHILDREN AND REALLY YOUNG PEOPLE MANY TEACHERS SAY IT DOESN'T AND THEY'RE DEBATING IT TODAY AT THE N.U.T. CONFERENCE HERE'S GOING COURTING AGAIN EIGHTIES DEPUTY GENERAL SECRETARY
GROOMING HAPPENS IN CHILDREN'S BEDROOM IT'S ON FACEBOOK SO OUR BEST CONTRIBUTION TO STOPPING IT IS TO ENCOURAGE DISCUSSION IN CLASSROOMS AROUND TOPICAL ISSUES BRINGING THESE IDEAS OUT AND LOOKING AT THEM AND I WORRY IS THAT THE PREVENT STRATEGY AT THE MOMENT IS CLAMPING DOWN ON THAT CHILDREN ARE FRIGHTENED THEY'LL BE REPORTED FOR ANYTHING THEY SAY SO DISCUSSION ISN'T HAPPENING ROBERT PIGGOTT IS OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT THIS IS A BIG SUBJECT WITH TEACHERS ROBERT
YES IT'S BECOME QUITE A BIG SUBJECT SINCE LAST JULY WHEN PREVENT WAS EXTENDED TO WHAT THEY CALL PUBLIC FACING BODIES WHICH INCLUDE SCORES SO NOW THERE IS A DUTY ON SCHOOLS TO STOP PUPILS BEING DRAWN INTO TERRORISM AND THAT DOES POSE A DUTY ON TEACHERS TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE AUTHORITIES IF THEY HAVE SUSPICIONS ABOUT A PUPIL OFFICIAL FIGURES SHOW THAT EVERY SCHOOL DAY AN AVERAGE OF TWO TEACHERS RING A GOVERNMENT HOTLINE WITH THOSE CONCERTS SO THEY'VE BECOME YES MORE MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT IT YOU DO GET SOME FAIRLY DAFT ONES THEY DON'T YOU
WELL THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DAFT SANDY ONE CERTAINLY I THINK ONE OR TWO OF THEM HAVE WHEN ONE HAS LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES HAVE NOT TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE AS THEY SEEMED BUT YES THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT IF PEOPLE COME FORWARD AND OFTEN THE CASE THAT CRITICISING ISRAEL OVER PALESTINE IS SIGHTED THAT PEOPLE CAN GET INVOLVED WITH THE AUTHORITIES BECAUSE THEY'VE SAID SOMETHING WHICH IN THE END HAS BEEN WHAT THE TEACHERS REGARD AS A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL OPINION AND THEY SAID THERE'S A DANGER HERE THAT IF YOU SMOTHER IN THEIR WORDS
THESE OPINIONS SEND IT WILL HAMPER PUPILS IN DEVELOPING THE VITAL SKILLS THEY NEED FOR CRITICAL THINKING SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY RESIST THESE IDEAS AND THEY SAY THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A BETTER ROLL THEMSELVES WHAT THAT'S THE THING ISN'T IT BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF RELIEVES THE TEACHER OF RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE HIS OWN JUDGEMENT DOESN'T IT I MEAN IT DID IT'S SAYING TO THE TEACHER AND YOU DON'T KNOW THE CHILDREN AS WELL IF YOU THINK YOU DO SEE YOU BETTER REPORT THEM TO US JUST IN CASE
MEEKLY ENCAPSULATES THERE AT THE COMPLAINT HERE THEY THEY SAY THE GOVERNMENT SAYS ACTUALLY THAT THE PREVENT STRATEGY DOESN'T INHIBIT OPEN DEBATE THAT'S DESIGNED TO GIVE CHILDREN THIS RESILIENCE THEY NEED TO RESIST THAT EXTREME AS HE IS THE TEACHER SAY
WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IS THAT THEY ARE BEING CHILLED FROM HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS IN CLASS THE CHILDREN DO YOU FEAR THEY'RE GOING TO BE REPORTED AND THIS IT'S DRIVING THESE VIEWS UNDERGROUND AND SO THEY'RE PICKING UP THESE ANSWERS KEVIN COURTNEY JUST PUT IT IN THEIR BEDROOMS ON FACEBOOK BUT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD SAY WELL ALL RIGHT WE'LL STOP IT
YES MOST UNLIKELY THEY'VE THEY'VE MADE THAT PRETTY CLEAR I THINK I THINK THIS IS TRICKY FOR THE NEW TEA AS WELL IT'S A IT'S A BIT OF A TIGHTROPE FOR THEM THEY WANT TO BE SEEN AS SUPPORTING THE DUTY ON TEACHERS TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO TO DO THAT THIS IF YOU LIKE TO STOP PEOPLE'S BEEN RADICALISED BUT THEY WANT TO DO IT BY PROVIDING THIS SAFE SPACE FOR THEM TO TALK ABOUT EXTREMISM RATHER THAN WITH HIS AUTOMATIC REPORTING TO THE AUTHORITIES SO I THINK THAT THEY ARE IN A TRICKY POSITION WITH THIS HOLE
WITH THIS WHOLE ISSUE ANOTHER LITTLE THING WHICH HAS NEEDLE IS THE INSISTENCE ON THEM TEACHING BRITISH VALUES AND THEY SAY THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE THEY SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH SOMETHING MORE LIKE THE U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS DEFINITION BUT THESE ARE THINGS LIKE THE SPEC FOR DEMOCRACY DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OF RULE OF LAW THE VIEWS OF OTHERS EXPECT ESPECIALLY OTHER
FAITH GROUPS SO THERE IS THIS IS THE SORT OF BRITISH RALLIES THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TAUGHT BUT I THINK TEACHERS SOMETIMES THINK THERE'S A BIT OF A MISMATCH BETWEEN THAT AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE RESISTING THESE EXTREMELY INTERESTING ELLA ISN'T IT ROBERT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME TEN TO SEVEN LEICESTER CITY IS A FOOTBALL CLUB AT THE VERY TOP OF ITS GAME NOT GLAMOROUS BUT CERTAINLY SUCCESSFUL CANNOT BUILD THAT SUCCESS INTO THE KIND OF GLOBAL APPEAL THAT MANCHESTER UNITED CHELSEA
LEICESTER CITY'S BILLIONAIRE OWNERS ARE FROM THAILAND THEY CONTROLLED THE KING POWER GROUP JONATHAN HEAD IN BANGKOK HAS BEEN FINDING OUT WHETHER THE CLUB CAN PROSPER WORLD WHY
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT AND A BLUE SHIRTED CROWD IS BUILDING INSIDE THE FUTURISTIC HEADQUARTERS OF KING POWER
THE COMPANY WHICH HAS GROWN RICH OF ITS NEAR MONOPOLY OF DUTY FREE SALES IN THAILAND AND WHICH OWNS LEICESTER CITY THE PREMIER LEAGUE'S MOST UNLIKELY SUCCESS STORY
SCANTILY CLAD WOMEN MINGLE WITH THE FANS POSING FOR PHOTOS AND APPLYING BLUE FOX TATTOOS
INSIDE THE COMPANY HE'S LAID ON FREE BEER AND FOOD AND GIANT T. V. SCREENS SO THE FANS CAN WATCH YET ANOTHER WIN BY THE SIAMESE FOXES AS THEY'RE NOW CALLED
A FEW YEARS AGO YOU'D HAVE BEEN HARD PRESSED TO FIND ANYONE IN THAILAND WHO'D HEARD OF LESTER OR COULD EVEN PRONOUNCE IT
THE FAME AND SUCCESS OF GIANTS LIKE MANCHESTER UNITED LIVERPOOL AND CHELSEA HAD ALREADY CEMENTED THEIR LOYALTIES OF FOOTBALL MAD TIME
AT THE PROSPECT OF A TINY OWNED CLUB WINNING THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS GAINING CONVERTS MAKE PATTER UPON TEMPTED YOU
YOU WERE A TRAITOR YOU'VE MOVED FROM OVER WITH LEICESTER U.K. CAKEHOLE
IS THAT NORMAL FOR PEOPLE IN THAILAND TO JUMP FROM ONE TEAM CAN GO TO ANOTHER
YEAH HOW LONG DID YOU SUPPORT MAN U. WELL IT'S LIKE
AND THEY'VE SWITCHED TO LEICESTER WHY YOU GUYS GO ON HIS TIE AND ALSO BECAUSE OF MY
LISTER BECOME KNOWN PICKED US UP GO ON
IF LESTER ARE TO ENJOY THE KIND OF ADULATION THAT BIGGER ENGLISH CLUBS GET HERE THOUGH THEY'LL HAVE TO WORK ON YOUNGER TIES WHOSE LOYALTIES ARE NOT YET FIXED
WITH EVERY LEICESTER SHIRT IN THAILAND NOW SOLD OUT I WAS REDUCED TO SHOWING THE KIDS AT THIS WEEKEND PRACTICE MATCH A PICTURE OF THE CLUB KIT ON MY LAPTOP

FOOTBALL HAS COME A LONG WAY IN THE PAST DECADE WITH LOCAL TEAMS LIKE MONT ON UNITED HERE PLAYING AT THE STADIUM JUST OUTSIDE BANGKOK
OFFERING A MUCH HIGHER QUALITY GAME THAN BEFORE AND WINNING A NOISY AND PASSIONATE FOLLOWING
WOULD LOVE OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE RUNS VERY DEEP IN THAILAND THEY ALL HAVE AN ENGLISH SIDE THEY SUPPORT TOO
ARE SOME OF THEM NOW ATTEMPTED TO SWITCH TO LEICESTER
MY NAIL I HAD TO COME ON NO I'VE BEEN IN A CHELSEA FAN FOR A LONG TIME AND I WOULDN'T MIND ROUTINE FOR A TIGHT PHONE CLAD WHICH S. BOUNCE BACK FROM NEAR RELEGATION THEY'RE GOING THEIR GUIDE EXAM DIDN'T GO WELL SECRETLY I AM WISHING LEICESTER WELL BUT I AM STILL A LIVERPOOL FAN
A LOT COULD CHANGE IF LESTER KEEP UP THEIR PRESENT FORM AND WIN THE LEAGUE
SHEER NOVELTY OF SEEING A OWN CLOUD IN THE VERY TOP RANKED OF WORLD FOOTBALL WILL ATTRACT HUGE NUMBERS OF FANS HERE
THE THIRTY NINE MILLION POUNDS THAT KING POWER PAID FOR THE CLUB SIX YEARS AGO AND THE MONEY THEY'VE SPENT SINCE WILL THEN LOOK LIKE ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS IN FOOTBALL HISTORY
JOHN HEAD ARE REPORTING FROM BANGKOK THE TIME SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN SHOULD RAIL FARES BE TIED TO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AT THE MOMENT OF COURSE THEY ARE NOT NOT BY ANY MEANS THERE IS A SUGGESTION WHAT ABOUT MORE AND THE SUGGESTION THAT THEY SHOULD BE RICHARD LLOYD IS ON THE LINE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WHICH HE'S MAKING THAT SUGGESTION MORNING TO YOU ONE JUST HAVE WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PROBLEM IS GOOD ACTUALLY WET WHEN THEY DO CUSTOMER SURVEYS WERE ALWAYS ALWAYS QUITE PLEASED WITH THAT TRAINS
WELL THAT'S WHAT THE TRAIN COMPANIES WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE ON A SPECIFIC JOURNEY AS THEY GET OFF WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH THAT OF COURSE A LOT OF THE TIME THINGS GO FINE AND THAT'S WHY YOU GET THESE HEADLINE FINDINGS OF APPARENTLY QUITE HIGH LEVELS OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE LOOKED AT THE REST OF THE OFFICIAL STATISTICS WE FOUND THAT WHEN YOU ASK THE SAME PEOPLE WAS YOUR JOURNEY VALUE FOR MONEY YOU GET A VERY DIFFERENT PICTURE YOU GET THE MOST FORTY EIGHT PERCENT SATISFACTION AND IF YOU'RE
A COMMUTER SATISFACTION IS RUNNING IT ONLY ABOUT A THIRD AND OVER THE LAST DECADE SATISFACTION ACROSS ALL TRAIN COMPANIES HAS ONLY AGED UP BY ABOUT A PERCENTAGE POINT EACH BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF MONEY BEING SPENT ON INVESTMENT AND ACTUALLY WE DON'T WHEN WE SEE THE JOURNEY ITSELF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO THINK ABOUT THE INVESTMENT AT THE SAME TIME SO IT SORT OF NATURAL THAT WE HAD AN ANSWER IN THAT WAY WE ARE PAYING FOR HUGE AMOUNTS OF INVESTMENT IN THAT INVESTMENT HAS BEEN SHIFTED ONTO PASSENGER FARES AND AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
SO IT IS RIGHT TO PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING MORE FOR THEIR MONEY BUT THE PROBLEM WE'VE GOT HERE IS THAT THE TRAIN COMPANIES JUST AREN'T UNDER ENOUGH PRESSURE
TO PUT THE BASICS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE RIGHT THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF COMPLAINTS BIGGEST DRIVER OF DISSATISFACTION IS HOW COMPANIES HANDLE CANCELLATIONS AND DELAYS AND VERY OFTEN IN PARTICULAR FOR COMMUTERS IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TRAINS ARE DELAYED ABOUT FOUR TIMES IN TEN HOW THOSE COMPANIES ARE DEALING WITH THE BASICS ENOUGH ROOM FOR PEOPLE TO EVEN STAND THE WAY THEIR STAFF ARE DEALING WITH PASSENGERS
THEY DEAL WITH CANCELLATIONS HOW THEY GET COMPENSATION TO PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD THEIR TRAIN CANCELLED THESE ARE THE BIG DRIVERS OF DISSATISFACTION THERE THE BASICS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO HIS RAIL FARES SPIRAL UP AS THEY HAVE RICHARD LLOYD SET IT DIRECTOR OF WHICH THANK YOU

THE WIND HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY TORRENTIAL RAIN PEOPLE TRAVELLING BACK FROM BREAKS ARE BEING ADVISED TO BE CAREFUL ON THE ROADS AND DELAY THEIR JOURNEYS UNTIL LATER THIS AFTERNOON WHEN THE STORM IS EXPECTED TO HAVE PASSED AN ONLINE FUNDRAISING PAGE SET UP TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY OF A SHOPKEEPER KILLED IN GLASGOW HAS RAISED MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND POLICE SAY AS A CHILD DIED IN A RELIGIOUSLY PREJUDICED ATTACK A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD MUSLIM MAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED
MEXICAN POLICE SAY THEY'VE ARRESTED A MAN THOUGHT TO BE THE MAIN MONEY LAUNDERERS FOR THE NOTORIOUS DRUGS LORD QUITE KEEN GROSSMAN WAS ALSO KNOWN AS EL CHAPO HUN MANUEL ALVAREZ IN ZONE ZONE WHO'S NICKNAMED KING MIDAS IS SUSPECTED OF LAUNDERING THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE SINNER LOWER DRUGS CARTEL THROUGH A NETWORK OF COMPANIES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CENTRES
HE WAS ARRESTED WHILE ON HOLIDAY IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY THIS MAN WAS RECAPTURED IN JANUARY AFTER BREAKING OUT OF A MEXICAN HIGH SECURITY PRISON AND IS NOW AWAITING EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED STATES THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN LAHORE
ONE OF THE MOST LIBERAL AND WEALTHY CITIES IN PAKISTAN IS REAL IN THIS MORNING FROM THAT HORRIFIC TERRORIST ATTACK YESTERDAY MORE THAN SEVENTY PEOPLE MURDERED BY A SUICIDE BOMBER IN A PARK NEAR THE CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND MOST OF THEM WERE WOMEN AND CHILDREN DOCTOR NADIA AT OFF FROM THE RED CRESCENT DESCRIBED THE SCENE
WAS THAT A HORRIBLE I GOOD ISING SCENE THERE ARE MORE DEN I'M GOING
CHILDREN WERE INJURED BADLY YOU AND I HAVE NO WORDS TO EXPLAIN THAT I'VE SEEN BECAUSE IT WAS DAD MUCH DEAD IT WILL
NOT ONLY ARE CHRISTIANS WERE TARGETED A HUNDRED OF MUSLIMS ARE ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS A PARK ON SUNDAY ARE MOSTLY ALL OF THE LARGE ALIENS WITH THEIR FAMILY AND OFF GOES THERE
THIS WAS ALSO THERE BECAUSE IT WAS THE EVENT OFF EASTER SO THERE WERE A MIXED COMMUNITY OR
JASON BURKE IS THE GUARDIAN SO GUARDIAN'S CORRESPONDENT HE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW THREAT FROM ISLAMIC MILITANCY GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE TALIBAN HAVE SAID THAT THEY WERE ATTACKING KRISTIAN'S SPECIFICALLY WHY
CHRISTIANS HAVE LONG BEEN ATTACKED IN PAKISTAN IT'S VERY SMALL MINORITY BUT ONE THAT HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF SUSTAINED HATRED AND SUSTAIN MISUSE OF LAWS THAT DATE BACK TWENTY THIRTY YEARS IN PAKISTAN AND I THINK ONE OF MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT THE TERRORIST ATTACKS TEND TO OCCUR AGAINST TARGETS WHICH THEY'RE PERPETRATORS BELIEVE WILL HAVE SOME KIND OF LEGITIMACY SOME KIND OF RESONANT SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN BUT
AS THIS ATTACK OCCURRED THERE WERE PROTESTS GOING ON AROUND THE REST OF PAKISTAN AGAINST THE HANGING OF ISLAMIC RADICAL WHO HAD SHOT DEAD A LEADING POLITICIAN WHO HAD CAMPAIGNED FOR CHRISTIANS CAME AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF MARCH ANTI CHRISTIAN
AGITATION AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IT'S NOT THE TERRACE WILL HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD STRIKE YES A SYMBOLIC TARGET RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE CITY THAT IS THE BASE OF THE POLITICAL AND EAT BUT ALSO ONE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE SOME RESONANCE AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPORTERS COUNTRYWIDE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET INTO THERE
WARPED MINDS HOW HOW DID THEY EXPLAIN HOW DO THEY JUSTIFY MURDERING CHILDREN
THEY HAVEN'T DONE BUT NOT EXPLICITLY IN THIS INSTANCE BUT OVER THE YEARS ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS HAVE DEVELOPED A WHOLE CANON OF WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS THEOLOGY BERTIE'S A MISUSE OF MISINTERPRETATION
OF THE CORE ISLAMIC TEXTS ONE THAT'S CONTESTED BY MAINSTREAM CLERICS AND SCHOLARS BUT WHICH EXPLAINS AND LEGITIMISES THIS KIND OF ACTION I THINK THEY WILL HAVE SIMPLY SEEN A VERY VULNERABLE TARGET ONE THAT WOULD SHOCK
AND THEY DO STILL SEEK TO SHOCK AND ONE THAT WOULD VERY MUCH UNDERLINE THE INABILITY OF THE PAKISTANI POLITICAL ELITE TO PROTECT AND NOT JUST A RELIGIOUS MINORITY BUT ANYBODY WOMEN CHILDREN AND MEN
OUT ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN A PARK ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY WHAT IF ANYTHING DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF THE WEAKNESS OF THE PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT
ONE OF THE DEEP PROBLEMS IF YOU LIKE OF ISLAMIC MILITANCY IN PAKISTAN AND THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THE CASE FOR MANY YEARS NOW IS THAT THERE IS AN AMBIVALENCE TOWARDS ISLAMIC MILITANCY IN PAKISTAN IN THE PUNJAB THE PROVINCE WHERE THIS ATTACK TOOK PLACE THERE ARE A SERIES OF OTHER ISLAMIC MILITANT GROUPS THAT DO NOT ON THE WHOLE ATTACK IN PAKISTAN AND WHICH HAVE CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PAKISTANI SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT THEY WERE OFTEN USED FOR OPERATIONS OVERSEAS OR HIS INSTRUMENTS OF FOREIGN POLICY
THAT AMBIVALENCE IS ONE THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CRACK DOWN EFFECTIVELY ON ALL ISLAMIC MILITANTS WHICH IT'S IMPORTANT IN THAT TO POINT OUT THAT THE PAKISTANI MILITARY HAVE PUSHED INTO ZONES AND ON THE AFGHAN FRONTIER WHERE ISLAMIC MILITANTS HAVE BEEN BASED FOR MANY YEARS AND LARGELY CLEAR THEM OUT OF SOME OF THOSE STRONGHOLD SO THERE IS A CONCERTED ACTION BUT THAT ACTION IS ALWAYS UNDERMINED BY THESE FUNDAMENTAL AMBIVALENCE OVER HAVING GOOD
MILITANTS IF YOU LIKE THAT ARE HELPFUL FOR STATE POLICY SECURITY POLICY AND BAD ONES WHICH ARE HARMFUL AND AS LONG AS THAT GOES ON IN THAT TRANSMITS INTO SOCIETY MORE GENERALLY THEN THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM JASON BURKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU THE TIME THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW AND THE BRUSSELS SUBURB OF MODERN BEAK WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE IN THAT PLACE WHICH HAS HARBOURED TERRORISM REMEMBER THE RINGLEADER OF THE PARIS ATTACKS CAME FROM THERE THE ASSOCIATION WITH HIS LIMO'S ISLAMISM IS NOT NEW
HOW TO TACKLE IT TWO WEEKS AGO WE SPOKE TO MICHELLE ELLEN BOSS CHAIRMAN OF MODERN BEAT COUNCIL AND HE TOLD US THAT THE ARREST OF SALAH ALARM THE SUSPECT IN THE PARIS MURDERS MIGHT MARK A TURNING POINT SADLY TRAGICALLY THERE WAS OF COURSE ANOTHER CHAPTER TO BE WRITTEN AND MY ELLEN BRUSHES ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING AND NOW WE'VE HAD THIS DEMONSTRATION WHERE WATER CANNON HAD TO BE USED TO BREAK UP A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO
ATTACKING AT ATTRIBUTE THAT WAS BEING MADE IN A MORAL THAT WAS BEING MADE TO THOSE WHO DIED AND IN THE LAST TUESDAY'S ATTACKS WHAT'S THAT A STATE IS A AND BEAK IN AT THE MOMENT
AND HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY THAT THE GUYS HAD ARRIVED ON THE POLICE ON THE BOOKS WHERE COMING FROM FLANDERS EXTREME RIGHT MOST OF THEM
BUT FOR THE MOMENT THE COMMUNISTS CALM WE CAN SAY IT LIKE THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM EVEN YESTERDAY THERE WAS SOMETHING WAS CHILDREN ON THE MAIN PLACE OF THE COMMUNE
AND PEOPLE THEY WERE HAPPY OR OF WHAT HAPPEN OR OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE PROBABLY HELPED AN HOUR STILL
SIMPLE SIMPLE DICK AGAINST WHAT HAPPENED TOM ON THE FACTS IN THERE IN BELGIUM AND WE EXTREME RADICALISM IN MUSLIM RELIGION BUT THE FACT IS THAT FOR THE MOMENT WE CAN SAY THAT
THE THERE IS A KIND OF PRESSURE LESS ON THE COMMUNE MISSUS WE FEEL IT YOU SAY THAT SOME ARE STILL SYMPATHETIC HOW DOES THAT GET CHALLENGE NOW
THE WORK IS IT IS GOING TO BE ON THE LONG TERM IT'S NOT EASY BUT ON WHAT HAPPENED FROM THE NAME THE NINETIES WE'RE AT THE STATION
IN THE COMMUNE STARTED UNTIL NOW WHERE SINCE TWO OR THREE YEARS WE HAVE REACTIONS ON ON THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ALSO A CHANGE
POLITICIAN SAID THE HEAD OF THE COMMUNE THE THE WORK BUT THESE LAUNCHED HIS MAW
A BREED ON ASPECT ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW HOME AT ALL IT ALREADY WE HAVE A BIG MASS OF YOUNG PEOPLE OTHER AN UNEMPLOYED WE HAVE ALSO SEVERAL PLACES INSIDE THE COMMUNE WHERE YOU HAVE
A CITY IN THE CITY POLICE IS GOING THERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM BUT THERE ARE LIVING TOGETHER YOU HAVE REALLY A NEW CITY A NEW COUNTRY THAT IS BUILT IN THE COMMUNE ITSELF AND THERE WE HAVE TO BREAK THIS AND THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN BY ENTERING SPEAKING WE SIR PEOPLE HAVE GOOD RELATION WAS THEM AND TRY ALSO TO RECREATE A NEW CITY IN THE CITY THIS MEANS THAT WE NEED ABSOLUTELY TO BRICK
DE DE THE BLOCK THERE'S BEEN BUILT BY PEOPLE GOING TO LEAF ALTOGETHER ON ONE PLACE AND STARTING TO LIVE TOGETHER WE THOUGHT
ONLY CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE AND THIS IS THE MAIN THING THAT WE HAVE TO DO IS TO FIND A WAY TO ENTER A DIS BLOCK AND NOT EASILY SAID NOT SO EASILY DONE
ABSOLUTELY WE KNOW IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE BUT THERE IS NO OTHER WAY WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH THINGS HAPPENING PEOPLE ARE LIVING TOGETHER ON ONE SIDE AND NOT OPEN TO WATER TO OTHERS WE NEED ABSOLUTELY TO THE BRICK DOWN
THIS WAY TO LEAVE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY WE HAVE TO DO IT IT'S CALLED A BIT STARTED YOU NOT MY WIFE YESTERDAY SAID
IT'S TRUE THE MOTHERS THAT WE CAN SOLVE THE SITUATION BUT THE CONTACT WAS THE MOTHER'S ACTUALLY IN THAT SOCIETY IS VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE I'M NOT OUTSIDE THEY ARE INSIDE OF THE HOUSE WHEN YOU GO AROUND AND PROBABLY LET YOU HAVE THE SAME SITUATION IN OTHER CITY WAY BIG BURSLEM
GROUPS YOU HAVE THERE THE MEN ARE ON THE STREET DOWN THE CAFE THEY DID THEIR LEAF OUTSIDE THE WOMAN IS LIVING INSIDE AND SO TO HAVE THE CONTACT THEM TO ENTER IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
AND BUY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US YOU'RE WELCOME THE TURN IS NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND IT'S WINDY VERY WINDY INDEED SIMON JONES A CORRESPONDENT WHO'S LOOKING AFTER THE WEATHER AS IT WORDS DIDN'T IT SO WINDY THE GATWICK AIRPORT HAD TO DIVERT FLIGHTS
THIS IS STORM KATIE AND I'M CURRENTLY OVERLOOKING THE RUNWAY HERE AT GATWICK AIRPORT AND SOME PRETTY CHALLENGING CONDITIONS FOR THE PLANES COMING AND GOING
LAST NIGHT WE HAD SEVERAL PLANES THAT MADE REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO LAND AND THEN I HAD TO BE DIVERTED UP OTHER AIRPORTS BECAUSE THE WIND WAS SO STRONG ONE PASSENGER
THEY FOUND A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE AND WAS GLAD TO BE BACK ON THE GROUND BUT JOHN AND QUIET PLEASE YOU CAN'T SEE ME AND I'M OVER COS I'M ACTUALLY STRUGGLING TO STAND ON MY FEET IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT THIS MORNING BUD
WE HAD SIXTEEN FLIGHTS CANCELLED SO FAR FROM GATWICK AND TWENTY HAD TO BE DIVERTED TO DO THEM ON US
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY DOWN THE BIGGEST WIN THE SPRAY WE'VE HAD RECORDED SO FAR IS ONE HUNDRED
NOW THAT'S AT THE NEEDLES OFF THE ISLE OF WIGHT
HAS ALSO BEEN PROBLEMS ON THE ROADS TOO AS WELL AS PROBLEMS HERE AND GATWICK YOU'VE HAD THE SEVERN CROSSING CLOSED OVERNIGHT WE'VE HAD THE DARTFORD CROSSING IN KENT THE BRIDGE OVER THE BEING CLOSE
A BIG FROM THEM IS THIS ONE IT WAS LIKE THIS CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE MORNING HERE IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND RIP ON AN AMBER WARNING COVERS
SIX SURREY AND HAMPSHIRE
AND THE BIG ISSUE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE ENDING THEIR BANK HOLIDAY A LONG BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND AND FOR MANY PEOPLE HASN'T BEEN GREAT WEATHER BUT TODAY IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE AND THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE TAKING TO THE ROADS THIS MORNING AND THEY'RE SAYING IF YOU CAN DELAY YOUR JOURNEY UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY COS HE'S PRETTY GUSTY
DOWN HERE AND IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THAT WAY THROUGHOUT THE MORNING SO IF YOU CAN TRY AND TRAVEL THIS AFTERNOON ROBERT HEADING OUT RIGHT NOW SO YOU ARE GEORGE THAT WAS SO THE SEAT DON'T EVEN TAKE OFF THE DATE THERE OF FLEA
HIS GARDEN I AM BLOWN AWAY NO YOU GO ON IF YOU CAN HEAR ME UP THERE WHEREVER YOU HAPPEN TO BE EXCITEMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHINESE ECONOMY ARE NOTHING NEW THERE IS A BIG NEW AREA OF CONCERN THERE AND IT'S THE PROPERTY MARKET TANYA'S
YES WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE CHINESE ECONOMY IS ALWAYS NOT IN A PRECARIOUS STATE PEOPLE OFTEN MENTIONED THE PROPERTY MARKET THE PROBLEM IS THEY TALK ABOUT IT AS IF IT'S A HOMOGENOUS BLOCK AND IT'S ANYTHING BUT THAT THE CONCERN IS SIMPLY THAT TOO MUCH AND WAS BUILT IN THE WRONG PLACE AND WITH TOO MUCH DEBT SO I SPOKE TO GEORGE MAGNUS HE'S AN ASSOCIATE AT THE UNIVERSITY OXFORD'S CHINA CENTRE AND I ASKED HIM IF HE COULD TRY TO DIMENSION THE PROBLEM
WHEN THE AMERICAN REAL ESTATE SECTOR WENT BUST IN TWO THOUSAND ATE IT ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT FIVE PER CENT OF THE ECONOMY WHO WAS PERHAPS THAT SIZE A LITTLE BIT LESS IN THE U.K. IN CHINA IT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT SO WHEN A SECT OF THIS BIG IS ROLLING OVER WHICH IS WHAT IT'S DOING NOW IT HAS DRAMATIC IMPLICATIONS NOT JUST FOR CHINA BUT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD TOO
TYPICALLY YOU WOULD IMAGINE THAT A MORTGAGE IN THE U.K. MIGHT BE EIGHTY NINETY PER CENT OF A PROPERTY POSSIBLY BUT IN TRYING TO THAT'S NOT THE CASE IT COULD BE ABOUT HALF SO EVEN IF THE PROPERTY PRICES FELL SUBSTANTIALLY PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE IN WHAT WE DESCRIBE AS NEGATIVE EQUITY
CORRECT IT WOULD NOT BE CHINESE URBAN RESIDENTS IN THE MAIN WHO WOULD BE ON THE RAW END OF WHAT WILL BE A BUST IN THE CHINESE PROPERTY MARKET IT'LL BE THE BANKS WHO HAVE LENT THE MONEY TO FINANCE ALL THE CONSTRUCTION IT WILL BE THE LAND DEVELOPERS AND PROPERTY DEVELOPERS AND IT'LL BE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IN CHINA THAN LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN TERMS OF THEIR ROLE ON THEIR ECONOMIC FUNCTION AND WHAT CAN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT DO ABOUT IT
THE GOVERNMENT REALLY SHOULD BE TAKING MEASURES TO TRY TO ALLOW THE OVER CAPACITY IN THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR TO DIMINISHED BECAUSE THE MORE OVER CAPACITY YOU HAVE THE MORE THERE IS A PROBLEM OF PRICES DECLINING AND IF YOU'VE BORROWED MONEY THEN FALLING HOUSE PRICES IN OR BECOMES A REALLY REALLY BIG PROBLEM UNFORTUNATELY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS PAYING AT BEST A PASSIVE ATTENTION
TO THE GROWTH OF DEBT INVESTMENT IS FALLING BUT ACTUALLY PRICES AND TRANSACTIONS IN CHINA ARE STILL RISING BECAUSE IT'S BEING FUELLED BY CREDIT CREATION WHICH THE CHINESE DO NOT REALLY HAVE THE BOTTLE TO ADDRESS AT THIS JUNCTURE
SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT THE PROPERTY MARKET IS GOING TO MISBEHAVE
ITALY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TIME BUT I WOULD SAY THAT SOME TIME BETWEEN NOW AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE ARE GOING TO SEE PROGRESSIVELY MORE NEWS ABOUT THE DETERIORATION OF CREDIT QUALITY BANK ASSETS THE ABILITY OF BANKS TO KEEP FUNDING THIS CREDIT BOOM IS GOING TO RUN INTO A BIT OF A BRICK WALL AND I THINK THE ISSUE FOR CHINESE DEBT
IS IT'S ON A TEAR IN THE LAST TWO YEARS A CHINESE CREDIT CREATION HAS BEEN ON ANOTHER SURGE AND WE KNOW THIS FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST IF CREDIT CREATION IS ALLOWED TO RIP AND HIS MODEL DRESSED IN GOOD TIME IT IS GOING TO END IN TEARS BECAUSE EVENTUALLY THE BANKS WILL BE THE CATALYST FOR SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL CRISIS
AND THAT WAS GEORGE MAGNUS AND JOHN HAS BEEN FIGHTING WITH ME ABOUT THIS BUSINESS OF SAYING DIMENSION BECAUSE CAUSED MANSION IS A NOUN IT'S NOT A VERB YOU CAN'T MENTION A PROBLEM UNLESS YOU'RE AN AMERICAN WHICH SHE PROBABLY YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IF YOU'RE AMERICAN THEY SHOULD ALL BE PUT DOWN ALL AMERICANS I DON'T SORRY NO LOVE ME IT WAS THE DOG THAT THE STRIPES ARE REALLY WHAT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT LET'S EXPLAIN THE DOG TAGS ON THEIR WAY HOME
SEVEN BECAUSE FROM WELL QUITE SOON APRIL SIXTH A WEEK ON WEDNESDAY ISN'T IT ALL BRITISH DOGS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MICROCHIPS THE IDEA'S PRETTY SIMPLE DOG GETS FOUND IT CAN BE RETURNED TO ITS OWNER OF IT STOLEN GOES TO THAT THAT THEY CAN SEE THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS MARIA WICKS IS HERE SHE IS WITH DOGS TRUST BASILDON SHE'S CENTRE MANAGER FOR THEIR REHOMING CENTRE CAN YOU RE HOME JOHN I DON'T KNOW
THE RE HOMING CENTRE BUT ALSO GEORGIE IS HERE WHO IS WHAT THAT TELL US ABOUT GEORGIE MARIA WORKS WHAT TERMS SHE'S EIGHT MONTHS OLD SHE'S AN EIGHT MONTH OLD IT WAS FRENCH SHE CAME INTO THE CENTRE WHEN SHE WAS FIFTEEN WEEKS OLD SOMEONE BOUGHT HEROIN AND SORT OF SAID THEY'D FOUND HER AND DIDN'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT HER SHE HAD NO MICROCHIP AT THE TIME
SO WE WE HELD HER FOR SEVEN DAYS AS WE DO WE HAVE ANY STRAY DOG THAT COMES IN AND IN THAT TIME SHE'S CAME HOME AS A FOSTER DOG WITH ME BUT WHAT WE DISCOVERED VERY QUICKLY THAT SHE WAS REALLY QUITE POORLY SO SHE HAD A NUMBER OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT SHE CAME IN WITH ONE OF WHICH WAS AN INOPERABLE HEART CONDITION
SO UNFORTUNATELY WE WEREN'T ABLE TO TRACE THE SOURCE OF WHERE SHE'D COME FROM AND SAY SHE'S NOW SAME THING VERY SWEET SHE LOOKS TOO AND SHE'S PRETTY PERKED UP MATCHES AND GERT GONE TOWARDS THE FRIENDS A SHE WHAT SAYS THEM HERSELF WHICH IS NOT BUT THE POINT BEING THAT IF SHE'D BEEN CHIPPED
WHAT YOU COULD HAVE FOUND SHE WAS CLEARLY PUPPY FARMED SO WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE IN THE U.K. AT THE MOMENT AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT WEIGHT WITH THESE DOGS NOT BE MICROCHIPPED WE'RE NOT ABLE TO TRACE THEM BACK AND HOLD THESE IRRESPONSIBLE BREEDERS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE'D BEEN DUMPED
BUT ABSOLUTELY WELL I REALISED HOW SHE HOW POORLY SHE WAS AND I COULD MAKE ANY MONEY FROM HER AND YOU CAN SEE THAT SHIPS WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF EVERY DOG HAS TO BE CHECKED IN YOU COULD INSTANTLY FIND OUT WHO OWNED THEM ET-CETERA THE PROBLEM SURELY
IS THAT EVEN AT THE MOMENT WITH QUITE A FEW DOGS BEING CHIP QUITE HIGH PROPORTION BEING CHIP THE CHEQUES ARE NOT DONE SO PEOPLE DON'T DISCOVER WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DISCOVERING PARTICULARLY VATS YEAH WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE AWARENESS WITH THREATS AND REALLY MAKE IT PART OF THEIR PROTOCOL WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME A DOG'S BOUGHT INTO THEM THEY ARE CHECKING FOR A MICROCHIP
AGAIN EVERYBODY WHO'S ON SOCIAL MEDIA NOW WILL SEE THE AMOUNT OF STOLEN DOGS AND AGAIN ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF THOSE WILL BE MICROCHIPPED AND IF VETS WERE DOING THAT CHECK WHEN THE DOG FIRST COMES IN THOSE DOGS COULD BE REUNITED AS THE TUBES POINTLESS ISN'T IT OF PEOPLE DON'T USE IT EXACTLY SO YEAH IT'S THAT THAT SORT OF PUDDLE RESPONSIBILITY DOES NEED TO COME BACK TO THE VET'S REALLY AND THERE'S THE MIKE THERE'S THE MAIN SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE
BUT THE BIG THING FOR US IS ACTUALLY A LOT OF DOGS GET BROUGHT INTO THE CENTRE WHO ARE VERY MUCH LOVED AND WELL LOOKED AFTER AND WE HAVE DOGS THAT WE CALL ESCAPE ARTISTS THEY LOVE TO BE OUT AND ABOUT A BIT OF A HURRY BY AND THEY GET BROUGHT INTO THE CENTRE
BYE WE ARE ABLE TO SCAN THAT DOG STRAIGHT AWAY AND USE OUR DATABASES TO CONTACT THEIR OWNERS AND LITERALLY THEY CAN BE REUNITED WITH THEIR OWN VINCE OR TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO THIS TIME FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE IT THE COSTAS WELL IT'S NOT HUGE IS IT BUT IT'S SOMETHING NO I THINK IF YOU TAKE THE JOB AT THE AVERAGE COST WOULD BE ABOUT TWENTY POUND BUT CERTAINLY YOU CAN TAKE YOUR DOG INTO YOUR NEAREST DOCTOR SENT OUT WE'LL DO IT FOR FREE RUN A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY
WE HAVE A WEBSITE COULD CHIP MY DOG DOT ORG DOT U.K. THAT YOU CAN GO TO AND SEE WHERE WE ARE RUNNING LIKE WITH VENTS AND TAKE YOUR DOG ALONG TO GET THE IT FOR FREIGHT MARIA WORKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALISED A TINY THE CHIPS SO IT'S LITERALLY THE SIZE OF A GRAIN OF RICE WE JUST WE USE A MACHINE THAT'S OF INJECTING IN BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES TAKES A SECOND BARELY PAINLESS AND THEN YOU KNOW YOUR DOG IS GOING TO BE REUNITED WITH YOU FOR THE REST OF ITS LIFE
THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING WELL PROVIDED PEOPLE READ IT THAT'S THAT THAT'S IT AND THE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT PEOPLE MUST REMEMBER IS WHEN THEY MOVE IS THAT THEY UPDATE THEIR DETAILS WILL THEY CHANGE THEIR MOBILE NUMBER COS WE SEE THAT A LOT WHERE DOGS DO YOU COME IN IT HAS GOT A MICROCHIP WE FIND THE DOG AND THE FINAL INSTEAD OR THE PERSON'S MADE FROM THEIR ADDRESS SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT AS WELL THANK YOU

THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD HAD SAY HAVE BEEN HAILING OVERNIGHT WHAT HE CALLED AN IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT IN THE WAR ON TERRORISM NEVER MIND THAT HE'S KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THE FACT IS THAT HIS FORCES ARE THE ONES BATTLING HIS LIMITS ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA AND IT SEEMS ABLE TO CELEBRATE NOW A REAL SUCCESS THEY HAVE RETAKEN THE ANCIENT CITY OF POUND NEARER THE UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE
THAT WAS SEIZED BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE ALMOST A YEAR AGO AMONG THOSE CONGRATULATING ASAD THE U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL BAN KI MOON YOU SAID HE WAS HAPPY THE TOWN HAD BEEN RETAKEN PRESIDENT PUTIN HIS SPOKESMAN POINTED OUT THAT IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN DONE WITHOUT RUSSIAN AIR POWER
DOCTOR AMA HOWELL ASM IS A SUPPORTER OF THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION BUT HE USED TO BE HEAD OF THE CENTRE FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DAMASCUS SO FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF PROTECTING THEIR REMAINS I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS PLEASED TO SEE THIS ASAD SUCCESS
YES CERTAINLY I MEAN MAYOR REMEMBER THAT EVEN AS A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION I'M OPPOSED TO THE REGIME BUT WE ALSO CONSIDER ICES TO BE ENEMY AND IN THE CASE OF CULTURAL HERITAGE IT'S AN EVEN GREATER ENEMY AND SO AS FAR AS THE RUINS OF PALMYRA THEIR IMPORTANCE IT'S DEFINITELY VERY GOOD NEWS THAT ISIS HAS BEEN PUSHED AWAY HOW MUCH DAMAGE HAVE THEY DONE
THEY'VE DONE QUITE A LOT OF DAMAGE THEY DESTROYED SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LANDMARKS ON THEIR SIDE THEY BLOW UP THE TEMPLE OF BELL
THEY BLOW UP BILE SHARE MEAN WHICH IS A SMALLER LESSER IMPORTANT TEMPLE IN THE BLUE UP THE ARCH OF TRIUMPH ORIGINALLY ERECTED BY EMPEROR SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS HAD TO COMMEMORATE HIS VICTORY AGAINST THE POWER OF THE ENDS THEY DESTROYED THE ORDERLIES PARTIALLY DESTROYED THE FUNERARY TOWERS IN THE NECROPOLIS
SO THEY'VE DONE QUITE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DAMAGE LET ALONE AS WE NOW KNOW ALSO THEY'VE DAMAGED A LOT OF THE CONTENTS OF THE MUSEUM BUT WE WON'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF HOW MUCH DAMAGE THEY'VE DONE UNTIL A FULL INSPECTION HAS BEEN OF THE SIDE BUT ALSO IT SEEMS THAT AND THIS IS WHAT WE FEARED MOST DE OFFENSIVE BY THOUGH
REGIME FORCES WOULD CAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE A LOT OF DAMAGE WILL BE INFLICTED ON THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL WELL IT SEEMS THAT THIS DID NOT COME TO BE YES AND I SEE THE HEAD OF SERIES ANTIQUITIES AUTHORITY HAS SAID WE WERE EXPECTING THE WORST BUT THE LANDSCAPE IN GENERAL IS IN GOOD SHAPE WE COULD HAVE COMPLETELY LOST HOW MIRROR THE JOY I FEEL IS INDESCRIBABLE MEANT SOUNDS AS IF THERE IS A FAIR BET THAT IS STILL STANDING AS YOU'D EXPECT I SUPPOSE COS IT'S HUGE
IT IS BUT ALSO THE FEROCITY OF THE ATTACK AS WE WERE HEARING WHEN IT WAS IN PROGRESS HOW MANY OF US WORRIED UNTIL I THINK EVERYBODY'S RELIEVED THAT THE WORST
COME TO BE YOU MENTIONED THAT EUROPE A SUPPORTER OF THE OPPOSITION IT IS NOW BACK IN THE HANDS OF ASSAD'S FORCES THIS IS STILL VERY VERY UNSTABLE ISN'T IT
YES VERY MUCH SO I MEAN ONE OF THE STANDARD TACTICS OF ISIS IS TO WITHDRAW OUR FACING OVERWHELMING FIREPOWER PARTICULARLY AIR POWER WE'VE SEEN THEM DO THIS BEFORE WE'VE SEEN THEM DO THIS BEFORE AND TELL I'LL BE IN WHEN AN OPPORTUNE MOMENT PRESENTS ITSELF THEY COUNTER ATTACK IN NOT SO LONG AGO A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY DID OVER FIFTY PEOPLE WOULDN'T CIVILIANS WERE MASSACRED IN THE PROCESS
LES ISIS IS PUSHED WELL AWAY FROM THE CITY WE CAN EXPECT HIT AND RUN TACTICS NOW AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF FIGHTING GOING AROUND ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY WHERE ISIS OVERDRAWN WHETHER THEY WILL CONTINUE TO WITHDRAW FURTHER
WHETHER THE REGIME WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND PUSHING THEM BACK AND I WILL JUST HAVE TO SEE THESE ARE VERY EARLY DAYS HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND ALBEIT RELUCTANTLY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE REGIME HAS GOT TO STAY IN POWER AS A AS A RESULT OF THE HISTORY OF THE LAST SORT OF YEAR OR SO DO YOU NOW
EXCEPT AS A AS AN OPPOSITION PERSON THAT ACTUALLY ASAD AT THE MOMENT IS THE ONLY GOVERNMENT THAT SERIOUS GONE NO NOT AT ALL AND I THINK A VERY MUCH STILL SEE IT AS PART OF THE PROBLEM NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION REALLY THE SOLUTION IS A TRANSITION LEAD ON THE ONE HAND PRESERVES THE BASIC CHORD STRUCTURES OF THE STATE BUT THE PROBLEM IS
HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO COMPROMISE AND THEREFORE I SEE HIM VERY MUCH A PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THIS KIND OF COMPROMISE WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO
CREATE SOME SORT OF UNITY GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE MODERATE ELEMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION AND THE MODERN ELEMENTS OF THE REGIME LET'S SAY IT TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE EXTREMISTS ON BOTH SIDES THERE IS NO HOPE FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION AND I DON'T SEE THAT UNFORTUNATELY I AM ACTUALLY QUITE PESSIMISTIC AT THE MOMENT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US IT IS NOW TWENTY TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND ACCORDING TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES OR SUICIDE BOMBING NEAR A CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND IN THE PAKISTANI CITY OF LAHORE HAS SENT SHOCKWAVES ACROSS A COUNTRY OFTEN SEEMINGLY INURED TO VIOLENCE THE ATTACK THE PAPER SAYS HAS PROMPTED RENEWED DEBATE OVER PAKISTAN'S POLICY TOWARDS HARDLINE ISLAMIST GROUPS WHICH HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN SEEN AS USEFUL ASSETS IN REGIONAL POWER POLITICS

THE TIME FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN LEEDS OFFICE THIS MORNING HIS NECK VEINS THE ANGLICAN BISHOP OF MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHEN I GOT BACK FROM THE EASTER CELEBRATIONS AND WAKEFIELD CATHEDRAL YESTERDAY I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THE HALL WITH THE DELIBERATE TARGETING OF CHRISTIANS IN THE TALIBAN SUICIDE BOMBING THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE CELEBRATIONS HERE IN THE COST FOR THOSE AND PAKISTAN COULD NOT BE STRONGER DEATH AND RESURRECTION AND NOT JUST THEOLOGICAL NOTIONS BUT LIVED REALITIES
FOR WHAT HAD BEEN ON MY MIND UP TO THEN WAS KARL MARX HE TALKED ABOUT THE COST OF TURNING PEOPLE INTO COMMODITIES MAKING PEOPLE AND IDEAS INTO THINGS
WHAT TRIGGERED THIS LINE OF MUSING WAS THE REPORT THAT EAST TO RISK BECOMING THE NEW CHRISTMAS APPARENTLY INCREASING NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ARE NOW SENDING EASTER CARDS BUYING THEM EXCHANGING EASTER GIFTS AND WHILE SEEMING TO REJECT NOTIONS OF RESURRECTION OR GOD SEEM HAPPY TODAY A FIRE BUNNY RABBIT WITH EGGS IN A BASKET AS THEY SAY IT'S A FUNNY OLD WORLD WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THIS WAS SUMMED UP IN A MEDIA REPORT I READ FOLLOWING THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY STATEMENTS ABOUT FIXING THE DATE OF EASTER ITSELF
THE RESPONSES SEEM TO REFER ONLY TO THE IMPACT THAT THIS MIGHT HAVE ON SHOPPING IN THE SALES OF STUFF EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE AND EVERYTHING ULTIMATELY GETS REDUCED TO ITS ECONOMIC VALUE OR USEFULNESS AS A COG IN THE ECONOMIC MACHINE I GUESS THIS IS THE FINAL ARTWORK IN THE LANGUAGE THE REPLACES THE SOCIAL MARKET WITH THE MARKET ECONOMY
I'M NOT SURE THIS IS ULTIMATELY HELPFUL TO US AS INDIVIDUALS OR AS A SOCIETY PEOPLE MUST SURELY BE WORTH MORE THAN THE MERE ECONOMIC VALUE THEY REPRESENT EITHER AS PRODUCER SAW CONSUMERS EVEN IF A COUPLE OF EXTRA DAYS' HOLIDAY PERHAPS EVEN SHOPPING THERE WELCOME
CHRISTIANS CELEBRATE EASTER IS THE DAY THE PROMISE OF CHRISTMAS BECAME SURPRISINGLY REAL THAT THE LIGHT THAT HAS COME INTO THE WORLD CANNOT BE EXTINGUISHED EVEN BY DEATH OR VIOLENCE OR DESTRUCTION YET AS I'VE WALKED WITH JESUS AND HIS FRIENDS THROUGH HOLY WEEK TO DEATH AND RESURRECTION THE LIGHTEST LOOK PRETTY DIM IN A WORLD IN WHICH THE POWER BROKERS FLEX THEIR MILITARY AND ECONOMIC MUSCLES TO KEEP THE SMALL PEOPLE IN CHECK
EASTER IS AN INVITATION TO FACE THE DARKNESS TO STARE INTO THE EMPTY TOMB TO WHERE DEATH IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN END AND IS THE OPPOSITE OF ESCAPISM OR FANTASY RESURRECTION DOESN'T DENY THE POWER OF DESTRUCTION OR EVIL RATHER IT LOOKS AT IN THE IRON GOES BEYOND IT TO NEW LIFE IF CHRISTMAS REPRESENT SINCE ONCE ON THE RICE A SONGWRITER PUT IT SURPRISED BY HEAVEN
EAST OF SURPRISES US WITH THE WHISPERED HINT THAT THERE IS MORE TO LIFE THAN DEATH AND MAULED TO DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
JESUS SUBJECTED TO PEOPLE BEING USED TO SMEAR COGS IN ANYONE'S MACHINE EVEN FOR THEIR OWN THEOLOGICAL PURPOSES AND SO MET HIS BEWILDERED FRIENDS AND THEIR ABJECT DARKNESS MET THEM WHERE THEY WERE THEY WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THEIR FUTURE WAS OPEN THAT THEY COULD BE FREE EVEN WHEN OPPRESSED AND THAT IS WHAT CHRISTIANS CALL HOME
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH NICK MAINS THE ANGLICAN BISHOP OF LEEDS TIME ELEVEN MINUTES TO WAIT THESE ARE NOT HAPPY TIMES FOR YOU KEPT THE PARTY'S IN TURMOIL PARTLY BECAUSE OF A SPECTACULAR FALLING OUT OVER SUZANNE EVANS WHO WAS ONCE A FAVOURITE TO TAKE OVER FROM NIGEL FARRAJ AS LEADER SHE WAS A DEPUTY CHAIRWOMAN OF THE PARTY SHE WROTE IT'S A LAST ELECTION MANIFESTO BUT NOW SHE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FOR SIX MONTHS ACCUSED OF BRINGING IT INTO DISREPUTE BECAUSE SHE PUBLICLY CRITICISED HER FELLOW CANDIDATES
SHE REJECTS THE COMPLAINT SHE SAYS NIGEL FARAGE IS DELIBERATELY SIDELINING HER WELL NEARLY TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND PEOPLE INCLUDING COUNSELLORS AND UKIP VOTERS HAVE SIGNED A PETITION CALLING FOR HER TO BE REINSTATED A REPORTER'S ONLY CONWAY'S BEEN TO MEET SOME OF THOSE ACTIVISTS WHO THINKS SHE HAS BEEN MISTREATED
I MEAN THE VICTORIA PUB IN CENTRAL LONDON AND I'M JOINED BY FOUR U.K. ACTIVISTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
HELLO I'M ALEX ON THE BALKAN I'VE BEEN A LOYAL ACTIVIST FOR SIX YEARS AND I'M A STUDENT AT ROYAL HOLLOWAY I'M NEXT I'M IN FIRST YEAR STUDENT ACTIVIST AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON AND I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE PARTY A LITTLE OVER TWO
HELLO I'M CAROLINE PIES I JOINED THE PARTY APPROXIMATELY TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO
I'M ALMOST A PENSION
I RICHARD HILTON I JOINED THE PARTY THREE YEARS AGO AND I WAS A PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE FOR MITCHAM AND MORDEN IN SOUTH WEST LONDON AND YOU'VE KNOWN SUZANNE EVANS FOR QUITE A WHILE YES WE ACTUALLY JOINED YOU TOGETHER
SHE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF BRINGING THE PARTY INTO DISREPUTE SHE TALKS ABOUT BEING BULLIED
WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON AT THE TOP OF UKIP I THINK THIS IS ABOUT TALL POPPY SYNDROME I'M AFRAID IT'S GETTING TO THE STAGE WHERE
UKIP IS BECOMING THE NIGEL FOR OUR SHOW IT'S NIGEL'S WAY OR THE HIGHWAY AND IT CAN'T BE LIKE THAT CAROLINE YOU KNOW SUZANNE EVANS WELL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING
THAT UP UNTIL A CERTAIN POINT MAYBE NIGEL FARRAJ WAS BEING
SOLELY IN CHARGE AND IT WAS ALL DOWN TO HIM AND NOW IF WE ARE
MAKE ANY PROGRESS AND THE PARTY HAS GOT TO BE CALM
SOMETHING THAT APPEALS TO A BROADER POPULATION AND SUZANNE CERTAINLY DOES AND I DON'T THINK NIGEL CAN I THINK HE'S COME TO THE END IN A WAY AND SUZANNE HAS HER WAY
PUTTING ACROSS VERY MUCH THE SAME MESSAGE BUT IN A WAY THAT COMES ACROSS THAT'S NOT AS OFFENSIVE
OR AS DIVISIVE NICK THIS IS DAMAGING ISN'T IT TO YOUR WORK IT MUST BE DAMAGING TO THE MORALE OF ACTIVISTS LIKE YOURSELF
I THINK IT IS SAD TO LOSE SUZANNE BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE CAMPAIGN IT'S A WHOLE CERTAINLY THE MESSAGE YOU RECEIVE ON THE DOORSTEP IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T TAKE MUCH NOTICE OF THIS KIND OF NEWS
IT'S WONDERFUL THE EVIL GOT TOGETHER FOR US BUT ALEX HOW IS THIS POSSIBLY HELPING YOUR PARTY BUT YOU WERE ALL JOINING IN THIS CRITICISM OF YOUR LEAD
I AM VERY AWARE THAT NIGEL WAS THE MAN WHO MADE THIS REFERENDUM POSSIBLE END WITHOUT HIM THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED
BUT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT OUR FUTURE AS A PARTY AT THE MOMENT WE CAN'T YOU DO THAT AFTER THE REFERENDUM WELL NIGEL ISN'T DOING VERY WELL FOR HIMSELF WHEN IT COMES TO KICKING OUT CREDIBLE PEOPLE LIKE SUZANNE EVANS IF ONLY IF ONLY HE KEPT THIS PERSONAL VENDETTA ASIDE UNTIL AFTER THE REFERENDUM THEN PERHAPS THINGS COULD WORK WOULD WORK MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY AS SOMEONE WHO'S
UP FOR ELECTION ACTUALLY I HAVE BEEN VERY ANGRY ABOUT THIS I'VE CONSIDERED LEAVING BUT I THINK THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO DO IT I THINK IF WE WANT TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE NOW PARTY WE HAVE TO STAY AND FIGHT FOR IT AND THAT'S WHY
SO YOU'RE IN DANGER OF BEING IN THE PROCESS OF RUINING YOUR PARTY WELL I THINK THE I DON'T AGREE THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT THE RUINING THE PARTY IS CHOOSING TO TAKE DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST ONE OF OUR MOST EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATORS BY A MILE PUTTING THAT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THAT'S WHAT'S IN DANGER OF RUINING THE REFERENDUM ALMOST AT THE POINT YOU WONDERED WHETHER HE WANTS TO WIN OR NOT AND I DO WANT TO WIN THAT'S WHERE SO WE'VE GOT TO STICK TO HER GUNS WE'VE GOT TO BRING ABOUT THIS CHANGE HE NEEDS TO MAN UP AND LEARN TO SHARE THE LIMELIGHT
WELL THAT WAS WELL WORTH IT THAT HE TOLD US BUT THEY WERE ALL OPPOSED TO MY LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS TO TIMBALE IS PROFESSOR OF POLITICS AT QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING I SUPPOSE I SHOULD MAKE THE POINT THAT WE DID ASK TO TALK TO UKIP FORMALLY AS IT WERE WITH A PARTY OFFICIAL BUT THEY WON'T TALK TO US SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T TALK TO SUPPORTERS OF MY ARROWS THEY ARE OUT THERE THOUGH PRESUMABLY
THEY ARE I MEAN NIGEL FARRAJ ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON THE PACK SAID MOST RESPONSIBLE IN SOME WAYS FOR WHERE YOU HAS GOT I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT TWENTY FIFTEEN MAYBE FOR SOME PEOPLE IN UKIP REPRESENTED AS IT WERE THEIR SURRENDER THAT STRATEGY I MEAN FOUR MILLION VOTERS WAS INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE BUT IT'S JUST ONE SEAT MAY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT SO THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF U.K. WEATHER IT
IT GETS LESS DIVISIVE AND EVANS WERE SUGGESTS A NIGEL FARRAJ IS A MOVES TOWARDS THE MAINSTREAM WEATHER CARRIES ON WITH WITH THE KIND OF FOGHORN MEGAPHONE POLITICS THAT'S HER MOTORCROSS YOU'RE SO GOOD AT BUT DOES IT HAVE A FUTURE ANYWAY AFTER THE REFERENDUM IF WE VOTE TO PRESUMABLY IF GO TO STAY IN IT HAS A FUTURE COS IT'LL KEEP ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD PULL OUT BUT IF WE'VE GOT TO PULL OUT THEN THAT ISN'T IT
SENDING HIS PARTY YES I MEAN OF COURSE THAT WAS WHY THE PARTY WAS ORIGINALLY FOUND IT HAS MOVED ON SINCE THEN AND IT'S MORPHED INTO A SORT OF POPULIST RADICAL RIGHT PARTY WHICH TALKS A LOT ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY ABOUT BRECK'S IT IT'S NOT GOING TO END THE ERA OF MASS IMMIGRATION THAT STILL GOING TO BE A VERY BIG ISSUE THEY ARE STILL GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND YOU KEPT POSSIBLY WILL BE THE VOICE FOR FOR FOR THAT GROUP
RIGHT SO WHAT DOES MY TAJ DO YOU KNOW THEN TO RESTORE THE PARTY'S UNITY IF IT EVER EXISTED MOST PARTIES AREN'T REALLY YOU KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE OF COURSE HIS EMPHASIS AT THE MOMENT HAS TO BE ON THAT REFERENDUM IT'S INTERESTING THAT THEY SUSPENDED SUZANNE EVANS FOR SIX MONTHS THAT WILL PREVENT HER FROM BEING A CANDIDATE IN IN THE LONDON ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS WITH NIGEL FROST GOES
STRAIGHT AFTER THE REFERENDUM WHERE UKIP AS IT WERE TO LOSE IT THEN OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BECOME A CANDIDATE FOR THE LEADERSHIP AS WELL SO TO BE HONEST I THINK A NICE VARIETIES ATTENTION REALLY HAS TO BE FOCUSED ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT YOU'LL SEE TO IT THEN SO WHY DID THEY GET RID OF
OR TEMPORAL IS THIS THIS IS A KIND OF LONG RUNNING DISPUTE IT'S ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY IT'S A DISPUTE BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT ACTUALLY YOU KICK CAN AS IT WERE DETOXIFY ITSELF CAN APPEAL TO A MORE MAINSTREAM AUDIENCES SUZANNE EVANS REPRESENTS THAT'S ACTION IF YOU LIKE THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO FEEL THE SAME WAY
AND THEN THERE'S THE NIGER FARRAJ FACTION WHO AS I SAY THEY DON'T REALLY SO MUCH LIKE THAT THE DOG WHISTLE IS THE FOG HORN AND THEY FEEL A MUCH MORE DIRECT APPROACH IS THE BEST APPROACH AND IT'S IT'S IT'S A CONUNDRUM FOR ALL PARTIES LIKE THIS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT RUN LOYAL CHARISMATIC LEADERS FOR FOR THEIR BREAKTHROUGH THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU'RE BEN REALLY REALLY DEPENDENT ON ONE PERSON AND WHAT THEY SAY GOES AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT THEN YOU'RE OUT RIGHT THIRTY SECONDS TO TELL US WHERE THE PARTY'S GOING TO BE IN A YEAR FROM NOW
WELL I THINK AS YOU SAY IF IF REMAIN WINS TODAY I THINK THERE'S STILL A PLACE FOR YOU KIT BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY WILL BE AN ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF MANY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO MAKE THIS AN ISSUE AGAIN AND GO FOR ANOTHER REFERENDUM A NEW CABLE WILL BE AT THE HEAD OF THAT I DON'T THINK WHEN NECESSARY TOY THOUGH EVEN IF EVEN IF WE WE LEAVE AND THE NEXT ELECTION
I'M CHECKING THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM IS I THINK ALWAYS GOING TO BE UKIP'S ENEMY I THINK THEY COULD STILL GET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MAYBE MILLIONS OF VOTES IT'S BE VERY DIFFICULT TO WIN SEATS TIMBALE THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED

ADAM PORTER REPORT IN THERE TEN PAST EIGHT AND LET'S FOLLOW UP ON THAT STORY BECAUSE IT'S COVERED IN GREAT DETAIL IN THE NEWSPAPERS MORNING JUST TO REMIND YOU WHAT HAPPENED THAT YOUNG BOXER NICKY BLACKWELL IS IN INTENSIVE CARE AFTER
THE FIGHT BLACKWELL'S OPPONENT WAS CHRIS EUBANK JUNIOR AND AS WE HEARD DURING THE FIGHT HIS FATHER CHRIS EUBANK SENIOR FORMER BOXING CHAMPION HIMSELF OF COURSE WAS SO WORRIED THAT HE WENT INTO THE RING AFTER THE SEVENTH ROUND AND TOLD HIS NOT TO HIT BLACK WELL IN THE HEAD HE IS PART OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TO HIM
LISTEN TO THIS ONE'S COMING TO WHY
COME UP TO THE FACE YOU GOING TAKE HIM ONTO THE BOTTOM
WELL I'M DRAWING ON THE LINE BY NIKKI'S FORMER BOXER HIMSELF OF COURSE AND A REFEREE INDEED HE WAS A PROFESSIONAL BOXER WAY BACK IN THE LATE SIXTIES GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE

AYE FOR A START CHRIS EUBANK'S ALWAYS CLIMBS IN THE RING EVERY ROUND HE DIDN'T CLIMB IN ON THAT BECAUSE HIS SANDWICHES IT WAS CAUSING TOO MUCH DAMAGE TO TWO BACK WELL NO IT'S WHAT I SAID TO HIM IS AND WHAT HE SAID TO THEM YES
THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT IT ANOTHER WAY AS WELL THAT AND THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT WAS HE WASN'T GOING TO KNOCK HIM OUT
BECAUSE HE'D HIT HIM WITH EVERYTHING HE COULD OVER THOSE FIRST NINE ROUNDS OR WHATEVER AROUND IT WAS IN
AND BLACKWELL WAS WAS A REALLY TOUGH COOKIE YOU COULDN'T DO IT SO SWITCH A TRACK DOWN TO THE BODY WHICH IS WHICH IS WHAT I THOUGHT IS WHAT HE MEANT WHEN I WAS WATCHING
YOU KNOW YOU CAN BECAUSE IT'S A LOT EASIER TO MY MIND ANY WAIT STOP SOMEBODY BY HITTING THEM IN THE BODY THAN IT IS ON THE JAW SOME OF THESE GUYS THEY GOT ROCKED YOURS YEAH WELL OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEARN ABOUT THIS ARE WE BECAUSE UNLESS OF COURSE CHRIS GUESS EH CHRIS EUBANK HIMSELF WILL MAKE IT WORK WE WILL PERHAPS TALK ABOUT IT BUT THE MOMENT
WE CAN ONLY ASSUME YOU'RE QUICK WILL INDEED BUT BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THIS YOUNG MAN WAS BADLY HURT AND QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED AGAIN I MEAN SOME OF THE PHOTOS OF HIM IN THE PAPER THIS MORNING A REALLY RATHER
HORRIFYING AND QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED AGAIN AS TO WHETHER THIS SORT OF THING SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN ONE MAN PUNCHING ANOTHER IN THE HEAD UNTIL HE GETS BRAIN DAMAGE
THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT NOT UP BUT THAT'S THE EFFECT OF IT ISN'T IT WHETHER WE LIKE IT LIKE THIS THERE'S A LOT THERE'S LOTS OF SPORTSWEAR YOU ARE GOING TO GET ACCIDENTS THE ORDER THINGS HAPPEN IT'S A LAW OF AVERAGE I KNOW BUT THIS ISN'T AN ACCIDENT IS IT THIS IS DELIBERATE YOU GO INTO THE RING IN ORDER TO KNOCK YOUR OPPONENT UNCONSCIOUS
YOU GO IN NO YOU DON'T GO IN THE RING IN OR DIFFERENT KNOCK YOUR OPPONENT UNCONSCIOUS YOU GO IN THE RING IN IN ORDER TO BEAT HIM ON POINTS OR IF YOU GET A STOPPAGE IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR RECORD SHOWS YOU WIN THE FIGHT IF YOU'RE NOT UNCONSCIOUS YEAH YOU ALSO WIN THE FIRE IF YOU'VE GOT A DISTANCE HAVE GOT MORE POINTS THAN EH ABSOLUTELY BUT BUT THERE BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE BY KNOCKING HIM OUT BY KNOCKING HIM UNCONSCIOUS YOU WIN THE FIGHT YES
BUT HERE'S THE MAN'S NATURAL INSTINCT IF YOU GET IS TO FIGHT YEAH ALL RIGHT AND IF IT MAN AND WOMAN'S NOW OUR FIGHTING AND THEY ARE GETTING THESE ARE BOX
HE'S GETTING A FAR BETTER IS IT
IT'S STANDARD OF LIVING IS BEING ABLE TO ALL RIGHT EARNED SOME MONEY ALL RIGHT BUT NOT MUCH GOOD IF HE'S GOT BRAIN DAMAGE THE QUESTION IS SHOULD THE REF HAVE STOPPED THE FIGHT EARLIER DO YOU BELIEVE HE SHOULD HAVE DONE NO I DON'T
HE WILL OR NOT I HE DID STOP THE FIGHT HE EVENTUALLY FIGHT YES YOU DID BUT THERE WAS NOT A CHAR LIME WHEN AND MAYBE THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF I THINK IT WAS AROUND SEVEN
WHERE YOUR BANK'S JUNI I CAME OUT OPENED UP IN THE EARLIER PART OF THE ROUND THE TRAPPED BLACKWELL IN THE CORNER ALL RIGHT
AND THERE'S A POSSIBILITY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BINNED BEEN STOP THEN BUT OTHERWISE THERE WAS NO REASON TO STOP THE FIGHT UNTIL
THAT SWELLING APPEAR ALL RIGHT ONE WHY NOT LET YOU STOP IT ALL RIGHT ONE OTHER QUICK QUESTION AND AS YOU SAY IT IS IT IS A SPORT SPORT THAT REQUIRES A HUGE AMOUNT OF SORT OF SKILL I UNDERSTOOD BLAZE BUT NONETHELESS WHY SHOULDN'T BE OLYMPICS BUT WHY SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE HEAD PROTECTION THAT WOULDN'T CHANGE THAT'S WORSE WORSE HER DOCTORS HAVE SAID THAT CAUSED MORE VIBRATION SO THE BRAIN
WEARING A HEAD GUARD THAT'S WHY IN THE OLYMPICS HAVE TAKEN HER GUARDS AWAY
YOU'RE NOT USING HER GARAGE THAT'S A FALLACY IS EGG AS THE MORE THEY GET THEY GIVE YOU MORE YOU YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE UNBEATABLE SHALL YOU GO OUT WITH THIS HEAD GUARD JUST ONE FINAL POINT ONE FINAL VERY QUICK QUESTION FOR ME THEN VERY QUICK SURE THERE'D BE A LAW THAT SAYS YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PUNCH HIM ON THE HEAD JUST HIT HIM IN THE BODY NOW
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD ONE ACCIDENT THAT IS NOW N. N. EVERY TEN YEARS
YOU GET THAT IN OTHER SPORTS YOU GET MORE ACCIDENTS OUT THERE WE GO ALL RIGHT THEY'LL BE A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT IT THAT'S FOR SURE BUT THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED FOR TALKING TO US AS O.K. JOHN I KNOW SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT IF WE'RE TO TREAT MENTAL ILLNESS SUCCESSFULLY WE NEED TO RESEARCH ITS CAUSES AND WHAT SEEMS TO WORK IN THE FIGHT AGAINST IT WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES PEOPLE BETTER PUTS LIVES BACK TOGETHER SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT SHE WOULD GO IN THE DIRECTION THAT SCIENCE SEEMS TO POINT
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT BUT LEADING DOCTOR IS CLAIMING THAT THAT ISN'T REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING PROFESSOR RICHARD BENT OCTAVES A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AT LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY CLAIMS AT THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL FUNDING IS SKEWED TOWARDS
BIO CHEMICAL AND GENETIC BASIS OF CONDITIONS LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA AND DEPRESSION AND IGNORES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS THERE ARE HIGHLIGHTS ARE GROWING DIVIDE BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGISTS FED UP WITH WHAT THEY SEE AS THEIR MEDICAL ISATION OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND NEAR A SCIENTIST AND GENETICISTS ARE INVESTIGATING THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF DISEASE TRYING TO DEVELOP NEW TREATMENTS SO WHO'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO PATIENTS IN THE MEANTIME A SCIENCE EDITOR TOM THINKING REPORTS
THIS IS ONE PERSON'S DO YOU NO AND YOU CAN SEE THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS
TWO PARTICULAR LETTERS BUT HAVE BEEN DELETED FROM EVERYONE THE WELCOME CRUSTS INSTITUTE'S DOCTOR GEOFF BARRETT TALKS ME THROUGH THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY THAT'S IDENTIFIED ONE OF THE KEY GENES ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF SCHIZOPHRENIA THAT TURNS OUT THAT CONFERS A VERY HIGH RISK BISCUITS
AND IT IS A VERY STRONG YES RARE GENETIC ASSOCIATION
HAVING THIS MUTATED VERSION OF THE GENE INCREASES THE RISK THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD DEVELOP SCHIZOPHRENIA SOME THIRTY FIVE TIMES IF WE UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTAL BIOLOGY OF THE DISEASE
IT MIGHT BE RELEVANT IN DEVELOPING NEW IDEAS FOR THERAPIES THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF PATIENCE SO BY DOING STUDIES LIKE THIS WHERE WE CAN STRONGLY IMPLICATE ONE AREA BIOLOGY IT GIVES A NEW LEAD FOR DRUG COMPANIES TO TRIED TO DEVELOP NEW THERAPIES IT'S CERTAINLY AN EXCITING DISCOVERY
BUT IT'S ALSO EXACTLY THE KIND OF CLAIM THAT MAKE SOME CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS SEE RED OF COURSE EVERY SINGLE ACTION EVERY EMOTION EVERY THOUGHT I'VE EVER HAD INVOLVES THE BRAIN PETER KINDERMAN IS THE PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL SO TO HAVE A PIECE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
TELLING US THAT THE BRAIN IS INVOLVED IN RESPONDED EMOTIONALLY TO EVENTS DOESN'T REALLY ADVANCED OUR UNDERSTANDING VERY MUCH AND YET IT DETRACTS FROM THE FACT THAT WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT RATES GO UP IN A PARTICULAR LOCALITY YOU GET A MEASURABLE NUMBER OF SUICIDES IT DETRACTS FROM THE IDEA THAT
TRAUMA IN CHILDHOOD IS A VERY VERY POWERFUL PREDICTOR OF EVEN VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS LIKE EXPERIENCING PSYCHOTIC EVENTS IN ADULT LIFE SO OF COURSE THE BRAIN'S INVOLVED AND OF COURSE GENES WERE INVOLVED BUT NOT VERY MUCH AND AN EXCESSIVE FOCUS ON THOSE ISSUES TAKES US AWAY FROM THESE OTHER VERY IMPORTANT SOCIAL FACTORS
BUT THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL MEDICAL MODEL OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR ONE BASED ON THE IMPACT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA
HE'S NOT ONE THAT'S RECOGNISED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS PROFESSOR SIMON WESTLEY I WOULD LIKE TO BAN THE WORD MEDICAL MODEL BECAUSE WHENEVER IT'S USED IT IS A KIND OF CARICATURE IT'S A STRAW MAN THAT'S ABOUT TO BURST INTO FLAMES WE ARE NOT WEDDED TO ANY PARTICULAR VIEWPOINT OR IDEOLOGY ABOUT BOTH THE NATURE MENTAL DISORDER OR THE TREATMENT OF MENTAL DISORDER AND IN PARTICULAR WE RECOGNISE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE BIOLOGICAL THE SOCIAL AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
BOTH TO HOW MENTAL DISORDERS DEVELOP AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO HOW WE TREAT THEM THAT'S THE TRUE MEDICAL MODEL IT'S ALL THREE IT'S A TRAGEDY ACTUALLY
IT'S A TRAGEDY BECAUSE OF COURSE ARGUMENT AMONG PROFESSIONALS ABOUT HOW THEY DEFINE THEIR DISCIPLINE MIGHT NOT MATTER SO MUCH IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT IT FRAMES DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH FUNDING IT'S A TRAGEDY FOR PATIENT'S CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST PROFESSOR RICHARD BENTALL RESERVES HIS HARSHEST CRITICISM FOR THE M.R.C. U.K. MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FUNDERS OF MEDICAL RESEARCH IN THE U.K.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE THINGS WHICH THEY FUND BY FAR THE MAJORITY ARE STUDIES WHICH INVOLVE BRAIN SCANNERS OR GENE SEQUENCING MACHINES THAT SORT OF THING'S MACHINES WHICH GO PING AND ALMOST NONE OF IT HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO UNDERSTANDING PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS ALL THE SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH THESE PROBLEMS DEVELOP SO
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET FUNDING TO LOOK AT THESE KIND OF THINGS IT'S A CHARGED THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL REJECTS BUT WHAT DOES ALL THIS LEAVE THE PATIENT BEING ON ANTIPSYCHOTICS AT THIS TIME I WAS TRYING TO DO MY G.C.S.E.S IT'S A DATE YOU AND
THE COVER IS OUT OF THE QUESTION RECOVERY IS HEART KIRSTEN KURT ELLIE'S SUFFERED FROM PERSONALITY DISORDER DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AS AN ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG WOMAN SHE'S A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL YOUNG PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP THEY KIND OF SCIENCE SIDE OF IT IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT I STAND BY
VERY STRONGLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD COMPROMISE AS IT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL
OR PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING IT'S ONE OF THE OTHER AND I THINK IF I CAN'T HAVE BOTH IT SAVES LIVES AND IMPROVES LIGHTS AS WELL
THAT WAS TOM FIELD AND REPORTING DOCTOR A BATTLE IS ON THE LINE DIRECTOR OF SCIENCE PROGRAMMES AHEAD OF REGENERATIVE REGENERATIVE MEDICINE AT THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL AND WOMEN IN THE STUDIO PROFESSOR DENTIL WHITES HE'S PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND REHABILITATION AT KING'S COLLEGE IN THE MORNING TO YOU BOTH AND THAT DOCTOR BUCKLE FIRST OF ALL DO YOU ACCEPT THAT DO YOU HAVE A CASE TO ANSWER YES GOOD MORNING THE THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT MENTAL HEALTH HE'S A HE'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE
AND I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL THING IS TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSES AND THE PROGRESSION OF MENTAL ILLNESS SO I THINK IT'S BEEN A LONG STANDING DEBATE THE ISSUE OF NATURE VERSUS NURTURE AND THE M. R. C. NEEDS TO MAKE SURE IT FUN'S THE RESEARCH THAT IS GOING TO HAVE THE MOST IMPACT WHEREVER IT COMES AND THE CHARGES THAT YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU ONLY SPEND WHAT THREE PER CENT OR SO ON THERAPIES
YES WELL AGAIN I MEAN M. R. C. IS ONE OF SEVERAL FUNDING AGENCIES IN THIS AREA AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT FIRSTLY THAT REMITS IF YOU LIKE IS TO FIRSTLY IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING AND BRING ABOUT INNOVATION IN TREATMENT APPROACHES WHETHER THEIR BIOLOGICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL
AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S FUNDING AND I CHAR WHICH IS THE AGENCY THAT SPENDS A LOT OF MONEY ON TESTING PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES AND PUTTING THOSE INTO YOU DON'T DISAPPEAR THAT FUNDAMENTAL POINT THAT ACTUALLY SPEND AN AWFUL LOT MORE ON WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL THAT THE GENETIC SIDE OF IT THERE BY A MEDICAL SIDE OF IT THAN YOU DO ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE OF IT WE DO SPEND MORE YES THAT'S TRUE AND OF COURSE I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE WE WOULD LIKE TO SPEND MORE OF OUR BUDGET ON MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH
WE DO TOTALLY EXCEPT THIS IS INTERDISCIPLINARY IT INVOLVES NEUROSCIENTISTS ARE PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WE DO FUND WORK AT AROUND SOCIAL IMPACTS ON MENTAL HEALTH WE HAVE A UNIT IN GLASGOW THE SOCIAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE UNIT WHICH LOOKS AT INEQUALITIES AND MYRA ISSUES AND SIMILARLY POPULATION STUDIES LOOK AT TRAJECTORIES INTO THIS SO IT'S NOT ALL BIOLOGICAL PROFESSOR WISE WHY ISN'T THAT ENOUGH
I THINK YOU JUST MENTIONED THAT ACTUALLY THE M.I.C. ONLY SPENDS THREE PER CENT IN TOTAL OH MENTAL HEALTH SO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THREE PER CENT JUST ON PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH IT'S ON ITS TOTAL MENTAL HEALTH SPEND WELL SURELY THE M. OR SUE SHOULD REFLECT AT LEAST THE BURDEN OF DISEASE IN THE U.K. FORM OF MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY THREE PER CENT SO THREE PER CENT SEEMS A TINY AMOUNT AND OUT OF THAT THREE PER CENT
AS A RUG BUCKLE HAS JUST SAID A LARGE PROPORTION IS SPENT ON GENETIC AND NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH AND NOT THAT MUCH ON PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH WAS SOCIAL RESEARCH HERE THEY SAID THEY DID DO SOME ON PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SEXUAL SUB YOU'RE SAYING IT SHOULD BE A CHANGE IN THE BALANCE OF WHERE THE MONEY GOES I THINK THE CHANGE IN THE BALANCE BALANCES ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON MENTAL HEALTH
SO I THINK WHAT THEY'RE DOING AT THE MOMENT HE'S ONLY SPENDING A VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THEIR BUDGET THAT SHOULD MORE LIKELY REFLECT THE OVERALL BURDEN OF DISEASE BECAUSE WE KNOW MENTAL HEALTH ISN'T JUST ONE PROBLEM THE DEFECTS PHYSICAL DISORDERS AS WE'RE ALWAYS BEING TOLD BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT BOTH THE COALITION AND THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT BUT MENTAL HEALTH AS A HUGE PRIORITY AND THE DOCTOR BACK OF WHY IS IT KEEP IT IF THAT IS THE CASE ONLY THREE PER CENT ON ON YOUR TOTAL MENTAL HEALTH
SPEND WHAT WHY WHY IS THAT SO WELL AGAIN I'M A MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCHER IS STATED PRIORITY FOR THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL WE CURRENTLY REFRESHING HOW STRATEGIC SORT OF
PLAN IN THAT AREA AND WE WANT TO INCREASE FROM THREE PER CENT I THINK IT IS WORTH POINTING OUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY TINY WHY IS IT THAT THE THE THREE PER CENT IS A BIT UNDER REPRESENTING THE REALITIES WE SPEND SIXTEEN PERCENT ON ON EURGH SCIENCE WHICH OBVIOUSLY COVERS A RANGE OF DISORDERS AND I JUST POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF THE MONEY WE SPEND IS CLASSIFIED AS GENERAL MEDICAL RESEARCH WHICH IMPACT SO IF WE ARE
SORT OF PUTTING IN POPULATION STUDIES THE SORT THAT I MENTIONED WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY INTEGRATE LIFE COURSE TRAJECTORIES LIFESTYLE INSULTS AND THE BIOLOGY OF BRAIN IMAGING GENETICS AND SO ON THESE DON'T NECESSARILY COUNTS AGAINST MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH BUT THERE ARE SERIOUS INVESTMENT AND PROFESSOR WIPES THAT THIS WE WERE HEARING IN TOMPION OTHERS PACKAGE THERE PEOPLE SAYING FOR GOODNESS SAKE WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT BOTH WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER IT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL CAUSES AND GENETIC CAUSES SECTOR OF THAT OBVIOUSLY IS THE CASE ISN'T IT
QUITE OBVIOUSLY AND PARTICULARLY THAT THAT YOUNG PERSON AT THE VERY END SAYING THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE BOTH KINDS OF RESEARCH THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THE M. I C. HAS FUNDED SOME VERY INTERESTING WORK FOR A FOR INSTANCE LAST MONTH THERE WAS A PAPER OUT ON AVATAR THERAPY FOR PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION FUNDED BY THE M. C. BUT THAT CAME FROM RING FENCED BUDGETS
WERE ADVERTISED ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO AND THEN WE GOT REAL PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH OUT INTO SCIENCE AND I THINK MAYBE WHAT THE M.I.C. NEEDS TO CONSIDER IS TO RING FENCE SOME OF ITS BUDGET SPECIFICALLY FOR
EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS AND UNDERSTANDING PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OCTOBER BUT WOULD YOU CONSIDER IT WE DO CONSIDER RING FENCING AROUND SPECIFIC CALLS IN CERTAIN AREAS I THINK THE SUCCESS OF AMOS THE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH IN THE U.K. MORE GENERALLY HASN'T BEEN THROUGH PUDDING ALLOCATED BUDGETS TO SPECIFIC AREAS IT'S ABOUT FUNDING IMPACTFUL SCIENCE I THINK THERE HAS BEEN GOOD PROGRESS IN THIS AREA IF I JUST POINT OUT HOW GENERAL SCHEMES IN TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
WHICH IS THE SORT OF RESEARCH THAT FUN'S INNOVATION IN THERAPEUTIC DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE INCREASED FROM SIX PERCENT OF THOSE AWARDS GOING INTO MENTAL HEALTH TO TEN PER CENT AND OVER THOSE TEN PER CENT SIX OUT OF THE THIRTEEN AWARDS THERE ARE NON PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT SO I THINK THE PROGRESS IS GOOD DOCTOR BUCKLED UP ROB BUCKLE AND THEIR PROFESSOR TILL BANKS AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THANK YOU
IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT IT'S TUT TUT
THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE BUT YOU NEED ME TO TELL YOU THAT NOT IF YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN I HAD CHILDREN OR EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T HE WAS CREATED SEVENTY YEARS AGO AND IT'S BEEN ON TELEVISION FOR THIRTY YEARS AND NOW THE COMPANY THAT OWNS IN WANT TO FIND NEW WAYS TO CAPITALISE ON THEIR INVESTMENT OH GEAR VERONICA CHAMBERS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WELL SORRY WILBERT AWDRY WHO OF COURSE IS THE CREATOR OF THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING TELL AND OF COURSE THEY THIS NEW OUT WELL NOT KNEW THAT THE COMPANY THAT BOUGHT IT PAID AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY FALL TO THE MOTEL ISN'T IT THEY BOUGHT YES YES MOTEL NOW THEY PAID SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS VIVIEN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TWELVES ARE NOT THAT LONG AGO
NOT THAT LONG AGO NOW THEY WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY OUT OF IT MAKING A FILM AND THERE ARE NEW CHARACTERS I KNOW YOU CAN CALL AN ENGINE A CHARACTER ANYWAY YOUR BOW ONE CARLOS AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS QUESTION IS THE BIG QUESTION IS WOULD YOUR FATHER APPROVE
WELL PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME THIS SORT OF THING BEFORE BUT I DO HONESTLY HOWEVER CLOSE TO SOMEBODY IT YOU CAN'T SECOND GUESS HOW THEY WOULD'VE FELT SO I I DO NOT KNOW BUT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASED ABOUT WAS TO THINK THATCH
THOMAS IS STILL BRINGING SUCH JOY SUCH PLEASURE TO CHILDREN AND GROWN UPS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND ALSO THAT IN EVERYTHING THAT MOTEL HAVE DONE THEY HAVE
STRICTLY ADHERED TO THE RIGHT RAILWAY PRACTICE LET'S PUT IT LIKE THAT MEANING THAT ALL THE NEW CHARACTERS AND LET'S FACE IT THAT IS WHAT IT HAS TO HAPPEN THE NEW CHARACTERS INTRODUCED A BASED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE ON ACTUAL LOCOMOTIVES I WOULD IF YOU CAN YOU CAN
THE SAUCE I THINK WE'VE GOT HERE IS IT CARLOS MEXICO THAT'S THE ONE RIGHT AND THE WEBSITE GIVES YOU A CONNECTION TO THE TYPE OF LOCOMOTIVE UPON WHICH HE IS SPACE TO COS OF COURSE HIS WOULD BE THE EARLY ONES ANYWAY WERE BASED ON ENGINEERS ON THE TELEPHONE RAILWAY IN NORTH WALES NOT THE VERY FIRST ONE I THOUGHT THERE WAS NO THE TALISMAN RAILWAY IS A NARROW GAUGE RAILWAY AND IT WAS LATER ON I THINK
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE PRECISE DATE BUT THEN MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE FERRY FIRST MEMBERS OF THE PRESERVATION SOCIETY
AND ENJOY USED IT UP WE HAD FAMILY HOLIDAYS UP THERE WHERE HE AND MY BROTHER USED TO VOLUNTEER ON THE RAILWAY AND THEN HE BEGAN TO WRITE STORIES ABOUT WHAT
THEY WERE THE LITTLE ENGINES LITTLE SCAR THE SCAR LOWY RAILWAY YES YES OF COURSE JUST A QUICK THING HE DOESN'T LIKE THE ONE THING HE WOULDN'T APPROVE OF IS IF THEY REFER TO THE MOST TRAINS HE SAID ABSOLUTELY NO
THOMAS HENRY CARLOS WHATEVER THEY ARE THE LOCOMOTIVES THE TRAIN IS THE LOCOMOTIVE PLUS COACHES CARRIAGES WHATEVER AND I'M SURE IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN JOHN THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT ABSOLUTE WELL THEY CERTAINLY HAVE IN THE PAST ABSOLUTELY OH THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT
IT MADE A MARK AND LET'S HOPE THIS WITH THE ROOF OR JUST TELL US QUICKLY WHAT THE NEW FILM IS CALLED WHEN IT COMES OUT IT'S CALLED THE GREAT RACE I'VE LEARNT A LOT ABOUT IT RECENTLY WE'RE ALWAYS INVITED TO THE PREMIERE IS COMING OUT IN IN MAY OVER HERE AYE
I DON'T KNOW THE PRECISE STORY BUT I THINK I THINK THEY HAVE TRIED TO EXPAND THOMAS'S CULTURAL OUTLOOK IF RIGHT WELL WILL I WE'LL RELEASE WAS WE RESERVE JUDGEMENT ON THE RONNIE RONNIE YES ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ALL THE BEST THANK YOU JOHN I'M IN A VERY MODERN TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO LILA RUBS IT WITH SPORT IS I COULD DO WITH A BIT OF THAT EXPANSION OF MY CULTURAL OUTLOOK TO SUPPORT AT THE MOMENT THE SECRETARY OF THE BRITISH BOXING BOARD OR CONTROL
HAS DEFENDED THE SPORT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE WEEKEND'S FIGHT WHICH LEFT NICK BLACKWELL IN AN INDUCED COMA FOLLOWING DEFEAT BY CHRIS EUBANK JUNIOR ROBERT SMITH SAID HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE REFEREE'S HANDLING OF THE FIGHT AND SAID THAT A BAN ON BOXING WOULD ONLY DRIVE IT UNDERGROUND AND ENGLAND GOALKEEPER JACK BUTTON SEEM CERTAIN TO MISTER EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP FINALS IN FRANCE THIS SUMMER TESTS REVEALED THAT HE FRACTURED HIS ANKLE DURING ENGLAND'S WIN IN BERLIN ON SATURDAY
WELL IT WOMEN CRICKETERS MEANWHILE WE'LL PLAY AUSTRALIA IN THE SEMI FINALS OF THE WORLD T. TWENTY AFTER A COMFORTABLE SITS SIXTY EIGHT RUM WIN AGAINST PAKISTAN IN CHENNAI THERE MUCH OF THAT WAS DUE TO AN UNBEATEN SEVENTY SEVEN NOT OUT FROM CAPTAIN CHARLOTTE EDWARDS WHOM I SPOKE TO EARLIER THIS MORNING
IT'S ALWAYS A FORM OF THE GAME OF LOVE PLAYING AND ENJOYED PLAYING IN AND I THINK IT BRINGS THE BEST OUT OF ME AT TIMES AND IT IS CERTAINLY A LOT DIFFERENT OVER HERE PLAYING IN THESE CONDITIONS IT'S A LOT TOUGHER A LOT SPIN BOWLING FORM SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE OUTSIDE A GOOD WINTER IN AUSTRALIA PLAYING A LOT OF TEA TWENTY TICKETS I THINK THAT'S HELPED ME COMING INTO THIS TOURNAMENT AND BEEN ABLE TO FOLLOW ON WITH THE FORM DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE THE FIRST WOMAN TO SCORE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED RUNS IN T. TWENTY
I DID FIND THE LAST NIGHT OF MY FAVOURITE REALLY OBVIOUSLY PLAYS YOU HAVE GOT TO THAT LAST YEAH FIRST MALE OR FEMALE TO DO IT SO IT'S QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT SO NOW IT'S AUSTRALIA IN THE SEMIS ON WEDNESDAY AND THEY HAD THE BETTER OF YOU HAVEN'T THEY IN THE RECENT PAST

TWENTY SERIES OF THE ASHES SERIES TO ONE AND WE'VE GOT A GOOD RECORD AGAINST AUSTRALIAN PUTT FROM WORLD CUP FINALS HOPEFULLY A SEMI FINAL FAIR DIFFERENTLY WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING IN DELHI LOOKING FORWARD TO
ANOTHER GREAT CONTEST AGAINST A VERY GOOD AUSTRALIAN COLOUR JUST A FINAL THOUGHT IS THAT THE SAME DEBATE IN WOMEN'S CRICKET ABOUT PAY PARITY WITH THE MEN AS THERE IS IN TENNIS

YOUR PAY IS MEASURED IN TENS OF THOUSANDS PER YEAR THE NAME IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR VERY MUCH OUTSIDE BUT I THINK WE'RE A LONG WAY OFF I THINK WE'RE MAKING PST MOST I THINK THAT PRIZE MONEY FOR THIS TOURNAMENT ON AT FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT THAT'S ANOTHER RISE THEN HOPEFULLY YEAR ON YEAR THAT WILL KEEP INCREASING JUST APPRECIATE EVERYTHING I'M GOING AT THE MOMENT AND LOVING EVERY MINUTE OF DOING WHAT I'M DOING MY GUESTS THE MONEY SIDE OF THINGS
WELL COME IF IF WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THAT OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR SO AND WE WISH YOU ALL THE BEST SHALL I WAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU AND SO THEN TO TODAY'S RACING TIPS FAKENHAM FOR THIRTY FIVE NUMBER FOUR WHO'S MICKEY BROWN MARKET RAISIN TO TWENTY FIVE NUMBER THREE NECK OR NOTHING THANKS ROB NO HERE'S KIRSTY WALKER DETAILS OF WHAT'S COMING UP ON RADIO FOUR AND A HALF AN HOUR
HELLO THIS MORNING START THE WEEK ISN'T A VIRTUAL FUG OF GORE WAS AND BLACK COFFEE AS WE SURVEY THE CUSTOMERS ARE SARAH BECAUSE EXISTENTIAL KATHY SEARCHING FOR THE MEANING OF BEING WITH SARTRE DE BEAUVOIR AND THE GANG WE ALSO SEARCH FOR THE TRUE ESSENCE OF INDIA'S HISTORY THROUGH FIFTY INDIAN LIVES ARE SOON HE'LL COME
THEY CLAIM PHOTOGRAPHER STUART FRANKLIN WRESTLES WITH NOTIONS OF TRUTH AND THE STILL IMAGE AND FRANCE AS BRAZIL ILLUMINATES THE LITTLE STORY OF FEMALE ARTIST THROUGH THE SELF PORTRAITS THEY PAINTED ACTION AND AUTHENTICITY WITH A BIT OF ANGST THROWN IN START THE WEEK JUST AFTER NINE
WEATHER RAIN AND HIGH WINDS WHICH HE CERTAINLY KNOW ABOUT IF YOU'RE IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND AT THE MOMENT AND PARTS OF WALES AS WELL THOSE WINDS ARE GONNA CLEAR TO THE EAST THEN THERE WILL BE SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS ARE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE OR SO MANY THE NEWSROOMS EPISODES MORE THAN SEVENTY PEOPLE INCLUDING TWENTY NINE CHILDREN ARE NOW KNOWN TO HAVE DIED IN A SUICIDE BOMBING IN THE PAKISTANI CITY OF LAW A FACTION OF THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN SAID IT CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK
A JOURNALIST EMBEDDED WITH THE SYRIAN ARMY HAS DESCRIBED THE CITY OF PAL NEARER AS A GHOST TOWN FOLLOWING ITS RECAPTURED BY I ASK MILLET FROM MILITANTS SYRIAN FORCES SAY THEY WILL USE AS A BASE TO BROADEN OPERATIONS AGAINST THE GROUP THE MAYOR OF BRUSSELS OR SAID BELGIUM'S AUTHORITY SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE TO STOP FAR RIGHT PROTESTERS DISRUPTING A VISUAL FOR THE CITY'S BOMB ATTACK VICTIMS YESTERDAY DEMONSTRATORS TRAMPLED ON A SHRINE AND SHATTERED ANTI IMMIGRATION SLOGANS
MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS ARE TO DEBATE WHETHER THEY SHOULD STOP CO OPERATING WITH PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ANTI EXTREMISM POLICY PREVENT MINISTERS SAY IT HELPS IDENTIFY CHILDREN AT RISK OF RADICALISATION BUT SOME TEACHERS ARE WORRIED IT'S STOPPING PUPILS DISCUSSING THE ISSUE
TRAVELLERS ARE FACING DISRUPTION ON ROADS RAIL AND AT AIRPORTS DUE TO THE STORMY WEATHER IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND PARTS OF WALES WINS HAVE BEEN REACHING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR
IT'S NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE IF YOU WANT TO SPREAD TERROR YOU SET OFF A BOMB IN THE PARK CROWDED WITH CHILDREN THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED ONE OF PAKISTAN'S MOST PROSPEROUS CITIES LAHORE YESTERDAY MORE THAN SIXTY MORE THAN SEVENTY I BEG YOUR PARDON HAVE DIED SO FAR THE ATTACK WAS CLAIMED BY A FACTION OF THE TALIBAN ARE THEY SAID THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY TARGETING CHRISTIANS
WHICH RAISES THE OBVIOUS QUESTION WHY WELL I'M JOINED BY A BISHOP OF MICHAEL WHO WAS BORN IN PAKISTAN AND BUY A CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT LISE DO SAID HE WAS IN ISLAMABAD LEE'S THE LATEST ON THIS HORROR
WHAT A HORROR IN DES'S EARS I SPENT THE WEEKEND IN LAHORE AND SO MANY PEOPLE WERE COMMENTING ON HOW QUIET IT WAS AND OF COURSE THERE'S TWO BECAUSE PAKISTANIS ARE ALL TOO AWARE OF JUST HOW FRAGILE THE SITUATION IS ISN'T SO IT WAS YESTERDAY WITH THIS CRUEL ATTACK DURING AN EASTER SUNDAY
BUT THE MOST POPULAR PARK AT ITS BUSIEST TIME IN THE PHOTOGRAPH SURE THAT THE THE BOMBER THE SUICIDE BOMBER DETONATED HIS VEST RIGHT NEXT TO THE STRINGS OF THE CHILD
THAT THE CHILD SWINGS AND NOW OF COURSE THERE MEETINGS GOING ON THE GENERAL STAFF HAD CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING LAST NIGHT PRIME MINISTER THE MUSH A REEF THAT'S HIS POLITICAL HEARTLAND IN THE PUNJAB LAHORE THE KAPPA PROVINCIAL CAPITAL HE HAS CANCELLED THE VISITOR LONDON HE'S HAVING EMERGENCY MEETINGS AGAIN THEY'RE VOWING TO DO SOMETHING AGAINST THESE MILITANT GROUPS AND PAKISTAN IT MUST BE SAID
IS BESET BY A BEWILDERING AND BRUTAL WAY OF ISLAMIST GROUPS ALL WITH DIFFERENT FORMS OF EXTREMISM AND THIS HAS BEEN UNDERLINED YET AGAIN YESTERDAY AT IT'S SUCH AN OBVIOUS AND IN A SENSE STUPID QUESTION BUT THE SORT OF PEOPLE WHO PLANNED THIS SORT OF THING DO THEY HAVE NO CONCERN AT ALL THAT THEY WILL MOST PEOPLE WILL BE UTTERLY REVOLTED DO THEY DO THEY NOT CONSIDER THAT ALL IS THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF IT
IT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF IT IS A SHOW OF STRENGTH IT'S A STRIP A SHOAL OF DEFIANCE THIS PARTICULAR FACTION OF THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN JIM OUT ON OUR HEADS EXPRESSED SYMPATHY AND SOLIDARITY WITH THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IT HASN'T JOINED IT BUT LIKE THIS SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IT REGARDS ALL NON MUSLIMS AS TARGETS EVEN IF
INCLUDING THE CHILDREN IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY ARE KATHY AS IF THEY'RE NOT MUSLIMS THEY ARE TARGETS AND THIS IS THE SAME GROUP THAT ATTACK ALMOST A YEAR AGO TO THE DAY IN A CHRISTIAN CAN NEIGHBOURHOOD OF LAHORE STRUCK TWO CHURCHES FOURTEEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED SO MANY PAKISTANIS ARE ASKING THEY WHY HAVE THEY PUT AT THE SOFTEST OF THE SOFT TARGETS THE MINORITY AND OFTEN PERSECUTED CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY THERE SHOULD'VE BEEN BETTER PROTECTION AROUND THE PARK
INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE THERE SAYING WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY ADVANCE NOTICE BUT THEY WERE TARGETED AND YET AGAIN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IS FEELING VERY VULGAR BUT NOT JUST THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY YOU LOOK AT SOCIAL MEDIA LAB THE THE HASH TAGS LAHORE PROUD PRAY FOR A LAHORE THIS IS AN ATTACK ON ALL OF PAKISTAN IN THE EYES RETURN NOW TO THE SECURITY FORCES WHO WHICH HAS TO BE SAID THAT AFTER
ANOTHER BRUTAL ATTACK ON CHILDREN YOUR LISTENERS WILL REMEMBER AND DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR CHILDREN KILLED IN ARMY SCHOOL DO YOU HAVE THESE SECURITY FORCES THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITY VOWED TO GET TOUGH THEY DID GET TOUGH THEY DID FIGHT BACK THE LAST YEAR HAS SEEN A DROP IN THE NUMBER OF MILITANT ATTACKS BUT THERE
IT'S LIKE THIS CRAZY QUITE CRUEL RUBIK'S CUBE YOU MOVE THE PIECES IN ONE WAY IN ANOTHER IS STICKING OUT UNTIL PAKISTAN ADDRESSES ALL OF THE MILITANT GROUPS IN ALL PARTS OF PAKISTAN THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THESE ABSOLUTELY CRUDEST OF THREATS TO THE SOFTER SOME PEOPLE PLEASE THANK YOU FOR THAT A BISHOP GOOD MORNING TO YOU
YOU ARE IN LAHORE I REMEMBER AND YOU SEE YOU SAY SOLOMON SUBDUED BUT BUT PRESUMABLY THERE IS ANGER AS WELL GREAT ANGER ONE EMERGENCY
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE HER BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU KNOW PAKISTAN WELL YOU YOU WERE BORN THERE WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING THAT IT IS NOT DOING
THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL QUESTION AS A BISHOP PEOPLE WILL COME TO YOU AND SAY WHY DID YOUR GOD OUR GOD CHRISTIANS WILL COME TO YOU AND SAY WHY DID GOD ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN TO OUR CHILDREN HE'S MEANT TO BE A MERCIFUL GOD WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM
BISHOP THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WE WERE HEARING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT SIMON JONES IS AT GATWICK THIS MORNING A LOT OF FLIGHT DISRUPTIONS AND ALSO DISRUPTIONS ON THE TRAINS AND ROADS IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND AND IN WALES AS WELL WE'VE GOT TO SIMON BACK ON THE LINE NOW WHAT'S WHAT'S HER LATER SIMON
KATIE MAY HAVE A RATHER BENIGN NAME BUT IT'S NOT PROVING TO BE THAT WAY THIS MORNING THE LATEST FROM GATWICK IS THAT THIS MORNING ALONE TWENTY SIX FLY
HAVE BEEN CANCELLED AND TWELVE DIVERTED THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE FLIGHTS WERE UNABLE TO GET INTO GATWICK DURING THE NIGHT SOME FLY
I CALLED SEVERAL TIMES TRIED TO LAND ABORTED THOSE LANDINGS THIS IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE TOO DANGEROUS I WENT TO OTHER AIRPORTS NOT SINCE I LAST SPOKE TO YOU I CAN REPORT THAT THERE'S NO SIGN OF THE WIND EASING AND IN FACT IT'S STARTING TO RAIN AGAIN WE HAD TORRENTIAL RAIN THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE NIGHT AND I THINK THERE IS A DANGER ANY TIME I COULD ACTUALLY TAKE OFF MYSELF BE BLOWN OFF MY FEET UNLIKE
THE PLANE'S HERE BUT ALONG WITH THE PLANES THERE ARE PROBLEMS ON THE ROADS WITH SOME MAJOR CROSSINGS BEING SHUT BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE WIND PROBLEMS ON THE TRAINS HAVING TO GO SLOW AND IT'S A BIG BANK HOLIDAY TRAVEL DAY THE END OF THE BANK HOLIDAY THE ADVICE
SOUTH OF ENGLAND THE BALL INTO THE PLANE TAKING OFF VERY LOUDLY THERE IS SOMEONE
LEAVE IT UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY IF YOU CAN BECAUSE THE STORM EXPECTED THE PATH BY THE EARLY AFTERNOON SIMON JONES A WITH GATWICK THANKS FORTY MINUTES DENYING WHAT CAN THE WORDS OF A COMPOSER BRING TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MUSIC THEY'VE WRITTEN BRAVELY THOUGH LIFE SOME GLOVES OF PLUG DEBUSSY IS PART OF THIS YEAR'S PROGRAMME OF EVENTS OF THE RYEDALE FESTIVAL IN YORKSHIRE
THE ACTOR SIMON RUSSELL BILL WILL READ FROM LETTERS AND DIARIES WRITTEN BY DEBUSSY AND RECOLLECTIONS FROM THOSE AROUND HIM STORY FOLLOWS DIVINITY FROM HIS INITIAL SUCCESS WITH THE PETER ROBIN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO HIS UNTIMELY DEATH IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN TIM WENT TO MEET SIMON RUSSELL BEALE AND LUCY PARHAM WHO ACCOMPANIES HIM ON PIANO AND PUT TOGETHER THE SCRIPT
ANOTHER MAN SOUL IT'S A THICK FOREST IN WHICH ONE MUST WALK WITH CIRCUMSPECTION SO I SHALL REVEAL MY OWN SOUL TO YOU MYSELF BEFORE IT IS
PARIS MARCH THE TWENTY FIFTH OF NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THE WORLD IS RAVAGED BY WAR AND THIS IS TO BE MY LAST NIGHT ON THIS
LUCY WHAT DO YOU GET BY HEARING THE WORDS OF A COMPOSER
WITH THE MUSIC YOU GET A SENSE IF YOU'RE IN THE AUDIENCE
OF WHO THIS MAN WAS I THINK OFTEN YOU GO TO A CONCERT AND YOU DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT THE COMPOSER AS A HUMAN BEING THERE JUST A LOFTY GENIUS IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DEBUSSY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO WAS
VERY TROUBLED AND MANY WAYS IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE HE WAS VERY VERY TROUBLED HE WAS AN UNLIKELY LIETH ARIA WOMEN TEND TO THROW THEMSELVES AT HIM AND HE WAS RATHER MEDIUM RATHER GRUMPY BUT OF COURSE HE WAS A GENIUS AND HE HAD A WAY OF ATTRACTING THESE WOMEN
LILLIAN I MARRIED IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE WE HAD A WEDDING BREAKFAST A LITTLE BRASSERIE BUT I WAS SO DEEPLY IN DEBT BUT I HAD TO LEAVE THE PARTY IN ORDER TO GIVE THE PIANO LESSON I RUSHED BACK HAVING MISSED HALF THE FUN IN THE KNOWLEDGE THE LESSON HAD AT LEAST PAID PAY FROM LIVING
BUT WE STILL HAD TO GO HOME ON FOOT THERE WAS NO MONEY LEFT FOR THE BUS
YOU WERE HAPPY TOGETHER I WAS WITH LILY LITTLE BILLY LIMO WITH HER DELICATE FEATURES SWEET SMILE SHE WAS MY GIRL THE FLAX
WHEN YOU'RE READING DEBUSSY'S WORDS AND HEARING THE MUSIC WHAT KIND OF MAN COMES INTO YOUR HEAD
THAT'S QUITE A TRICKY ONE BECAUSE I DON'T USE THIS IN A VERY PLEASANT MAN HIS RELIGION WITH WOMEN WAS PRETTY DREADFUL AND THERE'S AN APPALLING MOMENT IN THE EVENING THAT WE DO WHEN I READ ABOUT ONE OF HIS GIRLFRIENDS COMMITTING SUICIDE AND HIM COMPLETELY IGNORING IT REALLY JUST GETTING ON WITH HIS LIFE IS THAT I DON'T THINK I THOUGHT FOREVER AGAIN HE'S A TRICKY CANTANKEROUS MAN I THINK SOMETIMES YOU GET THIS BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A VERY PLEASANT MAN
DO YOU GET A FEELING FOR
YES AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY THAT VERY EXCITING AND BOLD
HIS LETTERS AND DIARIES VERY MUCH CONVEY THAT I THINK WE DO GET A SENSE OF PARIS AT THAT TIME AND ALL THE OTHER ARTISTS THAT WERE FAMOUSLY SORT OF LOCKED IN THEIR GARRET AND STRUGGLING THAT THING ABOUT PARIS IN THE WAR AND HIS DYING AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ACTUALLY RATHER MOVING NEAR THE IDEA THAT THE TWO CLEAN DOWN TOGETHER
SIMON WHAT DOES IT DO FOR YOU IN YOUR WORKING LIFE AS AN ACTOR MUSIC AS YOU KNOW I CHANGED MY AND I WAS VERY YOUNG THEN THAT WAS AS A YOUNG ADULT I WAS GOING TO BE A MUSICIAN AND I SORT OF PROBABLY SUBLIMINALLY SOMEWHERE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
RHYTHM AND TECHNICAL THINGS BUT ACTUALLY IN MY HEAD AND MY MUSIC IS A VERY SEPARATE IN A VERY SPECIAL PART OF MY LIFE AND I DON'T REALLY LINK IT WITH THE THEATRE AT ALL
AND YOU WON'T KNOW BUT LUCY'S MY PIANO TEACHERS I'D HAVE BEEN A POINT SIMON IS SUCH A WONDERFUL PIERCED WHEN WE GO AND DO THESE SHOWS TOGETHER THE FIRST PERSON WHO GETS ON THE PIANO ON THE STAGE IS NOT ME NO BUT THIS IS RUBBISH THIS IS RUBBISH THE REASON WHY THAT HABIT HE'S AS ANY AMATEUR PIANIST WILL TELL YOU THAT AS SOON AS AN AMATEUR BUSINESSES A PIANO HE WANTS TO PLAY IT WAS A PROFESSIONAL PIANIST DEBATES PROPERLY DOESN'T WASTE THEIR EFFORT HAD A CHEAP COURSE I RUSHED TO THE POINT HOW YOU DOING
I'M FINDING LEARNING MUSIC OFF BY HEART TRICKY SO YOU CAN LEARN KING LEAR BUT IF IT BUT IF IT COMES TO IT TO BE C. A. TWO JUST STUCK ABSOLUTELY STUCK UM AND GOING THROUGH THE KINDER CINEMA WHICH HUMAN KINDER SANE AND WHICH ARE TINY LITTLE PIECES OF THE TRICKIER THAN THEY LOOK BUT THEY'RE NOT HUGELY TECHNICAL POSSIBLE
IF YOU FETCHED UP IN A PARIS BRASSERIE AND DISCOVERED YOU WERE SITTING NEXT TO DEBUSSY IN NINETEEN TEN WHAT SORT OF EVENING DO YOU THINK HE WOULD
I DON'T KNOW I THINK I THINK IT WOULD BE QUITE FUN AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW THINGS I MEAN IT IS ASTONISHING THIS IS THIS PIECE IS THAT THEY'RE SO PART OF OUR REPERTOIRE NOW AND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN I ALWAYS FIND THAT FASCINATING WITH ALL COMPOSERS ABOUT WHAT POINT DID THEY SHOCK PEOPLE IF YOU WERE IN A BRANDS YOU WITH HIM YOU MIGHT FIND THAT HE'D NIPPED OFF TO GIVE YOU CAN LISTEN TO PAY THE BILLS WELL WILL HAVE ANOTHER AFFAIR BETWEEN COURSES AT THE RATE HE WAS GOING
LUCY PARDON SIMON RUSSELL BEALE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THE TIME NINE MINUTES TO NINE PRESIDENT ASAD IS STRUTTING HIS STUFF THIS MORNING HE'S LECTURING THE WORLD ON FIGHTING BACK AGAINST TERRORISM HAVING RETAKEN THE TOWN OF PALMYRA THE ANCIENT UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE THAT SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE OF JUST UNDER A YEAR AGO THE RUSSIANS TO CROWING AT THEIR PART IN THE VICTORY THEIR PLANES VERY HEAVILY INVOLVED SO IS THIS THE MOMENT THAT WE AND THE AMERICANS HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PATH TO PEACE
IN SYRIA PROBABLY DOES RUN THROUGH PRESIDENT ASAD THIS WAS DOCTOR AMARAL AS UM WHO'S HEAD OF THE CENTRE FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DAMASCUS AT LEAST THAT WAS THE JOB THAT HE HAS LEFT THE COUNTRY NOW HE'S A SUPPORTER OF THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION
A VERY MUCH STILL SEE AS PART OF THE PROBLEM NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION REALLY THE SOLUTION IS A TRANSITION LEAD ON THE ONE HAND PRESERVES THE BASIC STRUCTURES OF THE STATE BUT THE PROBLEM IS OUR SELLERS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO COMPROMISE
WELL LET'S TALK TO PETER FORD FORMER BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO US HERE ON THE LINE FROM SALFORD LORD DAMAGE AS WELL FROM CHEAP FOR THE GENERAL STAFF MORNING TO YOU BOTH
YOU HAVEN'T BOTH HAVE YOU SPOKEN ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE AS THE NEED FOR ASAD TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION I WONDER PETER FOUR DO YOU FEEL NOW WITH WHAT'S HAPPENED IN PAL MEERA THAT YOU'VE BEEN PROVED RIGHT AND THAT PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE MORE NOTICE OF HIM NOW THAN THEY HAVE BEEN
ABSOLUTELY THE LIBERATION OF PALMYRA THE CLEAR VINDICATION AT THE ARGUMENT THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCE WITH BOOTS ON THE GROUND THEY THOUGHT THE ONLY BOOTS ON THE GROUND THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH WE HAVE TO COORDINATE WITH THE RUSSIANS INCREDIBLY A FOREIGN SECRETARY JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE THE LIBERATION OF PALMYRA
WE'RE SAYING THAT BUT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT COULDN'T BE PART OF THE FIGHT AGAINST I GUESS THAT THAT FIGHT HAD TO TAKE CLAY THEFT OR THERE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE REMOVAL OF A EFFORT WELL IT IS NOW MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED
DO YOU AGREE LOW DOWN IN BROAD TERMS I DO AGREE I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT MISTER PUTIN'S
PLAY HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL HE'S SUCCESSFULLY PROPPED UP A SAD AND TOGETHER THE SYRIAN REGIME WAS BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO USE PETER FORD'S CORRECT EXPRESSION SUPPORTED BY RUSSIAN THEIR PARTNER AND IRANIAN SUPPORT HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT EFFECT AGAINST IRISH AND THAT IS TO BE WELCOMED I'M AFRAID WHAT IT SAYS IS A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE
HALF HEARTED ATTEMPTS TO GET RID OF ASSAD OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS WHEN REALLY THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE WERE FACING WAS I SILL THERE'S HALF ASSED ATTEMPTS HAVE FAILED AND FOR THE FUTURE I THINK WE'VE GOT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE RUSSIANS WILL DOMINATE AS FAR AS SYRIA IS CONCERNED
AND THAT THE WEST'S SUPPORT OF IRAQ AND THE MOVEMENT NOW TOWARDS RECAPTURING MOSEL BY IRAQI FORCES WESTERN BACKED
THAT'S PART OF THE RECIPE FOR THE FUTURE ISN'T THERE THOUGH A REALLY SERIOUS PRACTICAL ISSUE HERE QUITE APART FROM THE MORALITY OF IT PETER AFFORD THAT THAT IF THE WEST NOW GETS BEHIND ASAD AND IS SEEN BY THE LARGELY SUNNY OPPONENTS OF ASAD AS BEING BEHIND HIM THEN THAT ACTUALLY DEEPENS THEIR LONG TERM CRISIS THAT SYRIA AND ACTUALLY THE REST OF THE WORLD WILL FACE
NO IT DOESN'T WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION AS IT IS AND THE FACT IS THAT THAT REPRESENT TRUTH ABSTENTION
FRINGED WITH THE POPULATION AND IT CAN'T BE WISHED AWAY AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVES WHAT ARE WE SAYING THAT A SENTIENT FLIP STAND DOWN AND ALLOW THESE
MOTLEY GROUP WHO'VE READ BOTH COULD TAKE OVER THIS IS THE QUESTION WE NEED THESE ARE HARD DECISIONS IN THEIR THIRD HIT HOOF IS SIMPLY THAT THE LESSER EVIL BUT IT'S TOTALLY UNREALISTIC TO THINK THAT YOU CAN DEFEAT I
AND MISTER CAMERON HAS TOLD US REPEATEDLY THAT THIS IS THE MAIN PRIORITY AND THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO LOP OFF THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE IN WRECKER WELL THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU'RE TRYING TO UNDERMINE EFFORT AT ALL THE TIME NO DOUBT THEY MAKE A HARD CHOICE WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE HARD CHOICE THEN THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE NOW LORD DAMMIT AND IN TERMS OF DIPLOMATIC AND POTENTIAL IN TERMS OF MILITARY ACTIVITY I THINK THE PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
SHOULD BE A DIPLOMATIC PUSH AT THE PRESENT MOMENT YOUR I DIDN'T CATCH THE NAME OF THE SPEAKER RIGHT AT THE START OF THIS LITTLE PIECE AMARAL HAS UM HE USED TO BE IN CHARGE OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH INTO MASTERS IN OPPOSITION MAN I THINK IT IS AMERICAN BUT HE MADE A VERY INTERESTING POINT I THINK'S REALLY FUNDAMENTAL
IS THAT HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE SYRIAN REGIME CO BUT CLEARLY WANTS TO SEE ASAD HIMSELF GO AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT THAT THE GENEVA PEACE PROCESS SHOULD BE REALLY FOCUSING ON WE'VE SEEN SO MANY TIMES FROM LIBYA AND ELSEWHERE THINK BACK TO THE BALKANS IN THE NINETIES WHEN TITO WENT FROM YUGOSLAVIA WHEN THE RANGE WHEN THEY REGIME GOES YOU GET A VACUUM YOU GET CHAOS
WHO NEEDS TO GO HERE IS ASAD OVER TIME BUT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS REGIME AND HIS MILITARY WHO ARE SOCIAL SUCCESSFUL NOW FIGHTING ON THE GROUND BACK BY THE RATIONS BY THE RUSSIANS THEY SHOULD STAY SO THERE'S A TWIN APPROACH THAT COULD BE TAKEN HERE NO DOWN PETER FORD AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
