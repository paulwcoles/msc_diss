THIS IS A BOLD INITIATIVE BASED ON A SIMPLE PREMISE ALL IRREGULAR MIGRANTS ENTERING THE GREEK ISLANDS FROM TURKEY INCLUDING SYRIANS WOULD BE SENT BACK
BUT FOR EVERY SYRIAN CITIZEN RETURNED ANOTHER SYRIAN WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RESETTLEMENT IN THE E.U. DIRECTLY FROM A REFUGEE CAMP IN TURKEY ANYONE ATTEMPTING AN ILLEGAL CROSSING WOULD GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE QUEUE

ALEX THANKS VERY MUCH SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEADS THE TIMES PICKS UP ON THE STORY YESTERDAY OF THE FINANCE CHIEF OF E.D.F. RESIGNING OVER THEIR PLAN TO BUILD THE PLANT OR THE NUCLEAR PLANT AT HINKLEY POINT IN SOMERSET THE HEADLINE SCRAP WORST EVER NUCLEAR DEAL AND SAVE SEVENTEEN BILLION POUNDS AND THIS IS THEY'VE SPOKEN TO VARIOUS ENERGY ANALYSTS
ONE OF THEM SAYING THAT TAXPAYERS WILL SAVE SEVENTEEN BILLION IF THEY TEAR UP THE PLANS AND CHOOSE A TRIED AND TESTED ALTERNATIVE THAT'S THE SUMS COME FROM PETER ATHERTON WHOSE ENERGY ANALYST AT THE U.S. INVESTMENT BANK GEOFFREY'S SAVINGS OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION
A YEAR HE RECKONS AS A RESULT OF INDIA BEING PAID HUGE SUBSIDIES OVER THE TERMS OF THE DEAL ANOTHER ANNA ANALYST DOMINIC WITTER MET MAINLINE ENERGY IS QUOTED AS SAYING THE SUBSTANCE JUST LOOKS STAGGERING THE GOVERNMENT JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING IT'S THE WORST DEAL I'VE EVER SEEN
THE LEAD STORY FOR BOTH THE FINANCIAL TIMES AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IS THE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND THAT IT IS PREPARING TO PROTECT BRITISH BANKS AGAINST RUNNING OUT OF FUNDS IN THE EVENT OF A BRICK SAID VOTE IT WILL GIVE COMMERCIAL BANKS THREE EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES JUST BEFORE AND JUST AFTER THE JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD VOTE TO BORROW AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY LIKED OFFSET AGAINST ANY THREAT OF A BANK RUN THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE ACTION TAKEN DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND WHAT WAS PLANNED AHEAD OF THE SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM
THE CONTINGENCY MEASURES WERE NOT IMPLEMENTED BEFORE THE SCOTTISH VOTE IN THE PLANS WERE ONLY MADE PUBLIC AFTER SCOTLAND VOTED TO REMAIN PART OF THE U.K. THE BANK IT SAYS RISKS BEING ACCUSED OF SCAREMONGERING AND ENGAGING IN PROJECT FEAR TACTICS AHEAD OF THE SOAPS YOU CAN'T AVOID THE ROYALS THIS MORNING THEY'RE ON ALMOST EVERY FRONT PAGE AND CERTAINLY THE INSIDE PAGES TOO
THIS IS A RESERVE AS A RESULT OF A SKIING TRIP DUCK DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE HE SAYS ENJOY SECRET SKI HOLIDAY WERE AND CHARLOTTE SO THERE ARE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM LOOKING CUTE IN BOBBLE HATS BUT THE COVERAGE IS RATHER INTERESTING YES SOME OF IT IS KATE'S CUTIES IN THEIR SECRET SCREE SKI TRIP IS THE MAIL THE MAIL'S HEADLINE ON THE STORY BUT THE SON THAT GIVES EVER IT'S FRONT PAGE TO THE PHOTOGRAPH SAYING BUSY I'M SNOWED UNDER WORKSHY WILLS TAKES FAMILY SKIING THIS OF COURSE IS PRINCE WILLIAM'S BEEN
THERE HAD BEEN VARIOUS ACCUSATIONS NOT DOING ENOUGH WORK SHY IS THE WORD USED IN IN THE SUN ACCUSED OF SHIRKING HIS JOB AND ROYAL DUTIES AND THE SUN SAYS THE PHOTOGRAPHS AND THE NEWS OF THE HOLIDAY HAVE SPARKED A BARRAGE OF COMPLAINTS AND MOST OF THE GUARDIAN'S FRONT PAGE IS TAKEN UP BY AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROSPECTS OF MILLENNIAL SAYS BORN BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES OFTEN KNOWN AS GENERATION WHY IT'S FOUND THAT THEY ARE INCREASINGLY CUT OUT OF THE WEALTH BEING GENERATED
IN WESTERN SOCIETIES THE PAPER SAYS THE TRUE EXTENT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS GRIPPING YOUNG ADULTS IS TODAY REVEAL JOB LESNESS DEBT DEMOGRAPHICS AND RISING HOUSE PRICES ARE DEPRESSING THE INCOMES AND THE PROSPECTS OF MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST SIX
TURKEY AND GREECE WILL HAVE MORE MEETINGS TODAY AFTER THE SUMMIT WITH OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS BROKE UP LATE LAST NIGHT WHEN WE TOLD THEY AGREED AT LEAST THE OUTLINE OF A DEAL MARK LOWE AND IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN TURKEY AND MARK THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO DECISION AND IF THERE IS ONE IT WON'T BE UNTIL THE END OF NEXT WEEK BUT WE ARE GETTING WORD ABOUT THE SORT OF DIRECTION THEY'RE HEADING WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE PROPOSALS
THE KEY CLAWS SARAH AND WHICH HAS BEEN THIS CLEVER GAME CHANGER BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS ONE IN ONE OUT POLICY AND THAT WOULD INVOLVE TURKEY RE EXCEPTING RE ADMITTING THOSE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS ILLEGAL MIGRANTS THOSE WHO WERE BASICALLY THE WHO TAKE A SO CALLED ILLEGAL MIGRATION ROUTES STILL THE BOATS THAT ARE GOING TO GREECE SO THEY WILL BE DEPORTED BACK TO TURKEY INCLUDING SYRIANS
AND IN RETURN FOR EACH ONE THAT TURKEY ACCEPTS A SYRIAN WOULD BE WOULD BE TAKEN WILL BE DIRECTLY RESETTLED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION FROM A TURKISH REFUGEE CAMP SO BASICALLY WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE IRREGULAR MIGRATION ROUTES THAT HAVE BEEN SAID THAT WE CAN SING SO MUCH IN RECENT MONTHS ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND SO FAR THIS YEAR
THAT IS INTENDED TO END SO THAT THE HOPE IS THAT THESE ARE THE BOATS WHICH WOULD WOULD SLOW DOWN BUT THAT TURKEY WOULD BE ABLE TO RE SETTLED THOSE WITHIN THE REFUGEE CAMPS DIRECTLY INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS THE GROUP THE BROAD THEME BUT IT STILL HAS TO BE HAMMERED OUT AT ANOTHER SUMMIT NEXT WEEK IT'LL BE DISCUSSED TODAY BETWEEN A TURKISH AND GREEK LEADERS AND IT COULD YET BE VETOED BY LEADERS LIKE VICTOR ALL BAN OF HUNGRY WHO WAS VERY HOSTILE TO THE IDEA OF DIRECTLY RESETTLING MORE REFUGEES INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION
BUT IT WAS AT THE QUAY CLAUSE IN THE SUMMIT LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS THE THE COMPLAINT BASIS OF THE AGREEMENT THAT HE'S THERE'S BEEN FORMED BETWEEN EUROPEAN LEADERS THE IDEA THEY WOULD REMOVE THE INCENTIVE OF PEOPLE TO COME BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER THINGS THAT TURKEY WAS SUPPOSEDLY BIDDING FOR AN AWFUL LOT MORE MONEY AND SPEEDING UP OF PERHAPS IT'S JOINING THE EUROPEAN UNION OR AT LEAST BEING ALLOWED TO MOVE FREELY WITHIN THE
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO GET SOME MOVEMENT AT LEAST TOWARDS BOTH OF THOSE IT'S ASKED FOR ANOTHER THREE BILLION EUROS ARE DOUBLING THE ORIGINAL PLEDGE OF EUROPEAN LEADERS BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN ORDER TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS FOR REFUGEES HERE REMEMBER TURKEY ALREADY HAS ALMOST THREE MILLION REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS IN ITS OWN TERRITORY AND IT WANTS TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO WORK FORCE EDUCATION THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED WORK PERMITS FROM SOME FOR SOME SYRIANS SUCH WHICH WILL COST MONEY
AND IT ALSO WANTS A SPEEDING UP A VISA FREE TRAVEL FOR TURKS TRAVELLING INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT WAS GOING TO BE OCTOBER THIS YEAR THAT THE TURKS MIGHT BE GRANTED THAT BUT IT MIGHT BE BROUGHT FORWARD TO JUNE BUT AGAIN THERE ARE STILL SOME LOOP STILL SOME HURDLES TO JUMP OVER LIKE INTRODUCING BIOMETRIC PASSPORTS WERE OTHER CONDITIONS HAS NOT YET A DONE DEAL BUT CLEARLY TURKEY HAS COME TO THE SUMMIT WITH NEW PROPOSALS WHICH IN SOME WERE THE WORDS OF SOME DIPLOMAT STUNNED OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS
BUT IT APPEARS TO HAVE MOVED THE EUROPEAN UNION TOWARDS NEW PROPOSALS AND TOWARDS WHAT THEY HOPE WILL BE BREAKING THE DEADLOCK OF RECENT WEEKS MARK LAUREN THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND IT IS TWO YEARS SINCE MALAYSIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT THREE SEVENTY VANISHED FROM RADAR SCREENS AS IT WAS TRAVELLING FROM KUALA LUMPUR TO BEIJING TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PEOPLE WERE ON BOARD A CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HER JOINS US NOW FROM KUALA LUMPUR AND HOW IS THE ANNIVERSARY OF BEING MARKS JONATHAN
VERY QUIETLY MICHELLE I WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN ERROR WEARINESS AMONG THE FAMILIES OF THOSE ON BOARD WHEN I WAS AT THE SAME MEMORIAL LAST YEAR
THEN OF COURSE IN JULY LAST YEAR WE FOUND THE FIRST ONE HAD THE FIRST PIECE OF THE PLANE DISCOVER WHEN IT WASHED UP ON THE AFRICAN ISLAND OF REUNION A LONG WAY FROM WHERE THE PLANES THOUGHT TO HAVE GONE DOWN BUT IT WAS THE FIRST CONFIRMATION THAT THE PLANE HAD INDEED ENDED UP IN THE SOUTHERN INDIAN OCEAN BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NO CONFIRMED CLUE SINCE THEN A COUPLE OF PIECES FOUND IN THE AFRICAN COAST VERY SMALL ONES THAT MAY BE PART OF THE PLANE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA AT THIS STAGE IS WHAT HAT TO WHAT HAPPENED
SO THE FAMILIES REALLY ARE IN A LOT OF DESPAIR BUT THEY'RE ALSO QUITE WORRIED BECAUSE THE CURRENT SEARCH OVER A VAST SWATHE OF THE SOUTHERN INDIAN OCEAN IS DUE TO WRAP UP IN JUNE THIS AREA WAS CHOSEN ON THE BASIS HE'S AND SOME VERY
FLIMSY SATELLITE CONNECTIONS TO THE PLANE AS IT HEADED SOUTH A SMALLEST GUESSWORK ONCE THAT SEARCH AREA HAS BEEN SP HAS BEEN FINISHED IT'LL BE TWO YEARS OF WORK THERE ARE NO PLANS TO EXTEND IT IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR HOW YOU'D CHOOSE ANOTHER AREA AND AT THAT POINT WE WOULD EXPECT THE SEARCH TO BE OVER THE PLANE TO BE DECLARED LOST AND ALL HOPE FOR THE FAMILIES WHO REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR LOVED ONES WITH AN END AND THEY WOULD FOR OBVIOUS REASONS LIKE TO SEE THE SEARCH CARRY ON FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
YES AND THE POINT THEY'RE MAKING IS LOOK YES IT'S EXPENSIVE IT'S COST NINETY MILLION POUNDS SO FAR VERY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS DO THE SEARCHING AND VERY DEEP SEAS BUT THEY SAY THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED DISASTER AND THAT THERE ARE VERY SERIOUS QUESTIONS
OF SAFETY AVIATION SAFETY FOR THE FLYING PUBLIC THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED AND THAT MAKES IT THEY ARGUE A PRIORITY FOR EVERYONE BUT EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO RECOVER THE WRECKAGE OF THIS PLANE THERE ALREADY NOW BEING FORCED TO TAKE UP LAW SUITS BECAUSE AVIATION OR REQUIRES YOU TO DO IT WITHIN TWO YEARS AGAINST THE AIRLINE THEY'RE FINDING THAT VERY PAINFUL BECAUSE THAT MORE LESS FORCES THEM TO ADMIT THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE RELATIVES ARE NOT COMING BACK AMONGST THE EXTRAORDINARY MYSTERY OF THIS THIS DISAPPEARED AIRCRAFT
OUR INCREDIBLE PERSONAL TRAGEDY AND IT IS AMAZING TO SEE THE STOICISM BUT ALSO THAT BARELY HIDDEN PAIN OF THE FAMILIES WHO CAN'T GRIEVE AND HE CAN'T SAY GOODBYE JONATHAN HAD IN MALAYSIA THANK YOU
IT'S NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX NPOWER IS CUTTING JOBS E.D.F. HAS LOST ITS FINANCE CHIEF AND THERE'S A PROBE INTO THE ENERGY MARKET FORTHCOMING AT LOTS TO TALK ABOUT IN THE ENERGY SECTOR JOE LINE AND IS HERE TO DO THAT JOE YEAH I W. E. UNKIND ELEC TWAS HE THERE IS THE COPY THAT OWNS N. POWER AND AS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ENERGY COMPANIES IN EUROPE NPOWER MADE AN OPERATING LOSS OF ONE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLION POUNDS FOR THE YEAR
WE ALSO EXPECT TO GET CONFIRMATION THAT AROUND TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND JOBS ARE GOING AT THE COMPANY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE AROUND SEVEN O'CLOCK ADD IN THE RESIGNATIONS AT RIVALS E.D.F. OVER THE HINCKLEY NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AND WE'VE GOT PLENTY TO TALK ABOUT WITH PROFESSOR DAVID ELMS FROM WARWICK BUSINESS SCHOOL GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR GOOD MORNING ARGUE DUBHE RESULTS HAVE JUST DROPPED THEIR IT'S PAGE AFTER PAGE DREAM AFTER REAMS OF STUFF AS ANYTHING STRUCK YOU ABOUT THE COMPANY
WELL THIS IS NEWS THAT A W. WE AS A COMPANY OVERALL IS FACING A LOT OF CHALLENGES AS ARE MANY OF THE OTHER COMPANIES WHO SUPPLY POWER ACROSS EUROPE AND MOVING AWAY FROM AN OLD MODEL OF THINK POWER STATIONS
USING FOSSIL FUELS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO CHANGE TO DIFFERENT COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE GREENHOUSE MORE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TO HELP CUSTOMERS SAVE ENERGY AS MUCH AS SUPPLYING IT AND THAT'S CAUSING A LOT OF STRESSES AND STRAINS SO WHAT WE SEE HERE IN THE U.K. WITH N. POWER IS A COMPANY THAT MADE SOME REALLY QUITE SERIOUS MISTAKES IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING AN I.T. SYSTEM TO BILL CUSTOMERS THEY ENDED UP BILLING CUSTOMERS LATE OR WITH THE WRONG INFORMATION
NOW THEY'VE BEEN FINED FOR THAT BY THE REGULATOR WHO AND THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY'VE SORT OF NOW PUT THAT BEHIND THEM AND SOME OF THE JOB LOSSES ARE RELATED TO GETTING BACK TO NORMAL BUSINESS AFTER THEY TOOK ON A LOT OF EXTRA PEOPLE TO SORT OUT THE PROBLEM
BUT CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IT SHOWS JUST HOW TOUGH IT IS IN THE U.K. ENERGY RETAIL MARKET IT IS THAT IT IS THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT HAS LED TO THIS LOSS BEING AN ISSUE ABOUT EMPEROR OR IS THE CASE THAT THE INDEPENDENCE THE SMALL ONES AND SMALL COMPANIES THERE ARE TO SERIOUSLY NIBBLE AT THE HEELS OF THE BIG SIX ARE HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE BOTTOM LINE
THAT IS RIGHT SO AS PART OF THE CHANGES GOING ON THE AIM IS TO BRING TO ENCOURAGE SMALLER COMPANIES TO COMPETE AGAINST THE SO CALLED BIG SIX AND THOSE COMPANIES HAVE COME IN THEY OPERATE IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT REGIME THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR SOME OF THE SORT OF SUBSIDIES THAT THE BIGGER COMPANIES HAVE TO PAY FOR AND SO THEY'VE BUILT UP QUITE A GOOD COMPETITION
WHAT'S INTERESTING NOW IS THOSE COMPANIES ARE GETTING TO A SCALE THEMSELVES SWEAR YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT QUITE SO SMALL ANY MORE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A FIRST UTILITY AND OTHER ONES EXACTLY SO WE ARE IN A PERIOD OF HUGE CHANGE IN THE POWER INDUSTRY BOTH ON THE GENERATION SIDE WHICH GOES BACK TO THE HINKLEY POINT DISCUSSION AND ALSO ON THE RETAIL STOCKING OF HINKLEY POINT E.D.F. RESIGNATION DO YOU THINK THAT WE NOW THINK
THAT THIS PROJECT WILL DEFINITELY GO AHEAD BECAUSE THE POLITICAL WILL IS NOW THERE THEY'VE GOT RID OF ONE GUY WHO REALLY OBJECTED SO THE BACKGROUND IS THAT NOW THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER PERSONALLY ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY IN THE COMPANY FOR RUNNING IT IN A SORT OF FINANCIALLY PRUDENT WAY WHO WAS SAYING THAT THIS IS A HUGE DEAL THAT IS ALMOST THE SCALE OF THE WHOLE COMPANY AND THAT MEANS THAT THEY WERE PUTTING A LOT OF A LOT OF THEIR HOPES INTO ONE PROJECT
AND SO HE WAS SEEN AS BEING CONCERNED ABOUT THIS NOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN THE POLITICAL AGREEMENT MEETINGS BETWEEN BUT DO YOU THINK NOW THE PROJECT IS MORE LIKELY OR LESS LIKELY TO GO AHEAD I THINK HE'S MORE LIKELY TO MOVE AHEAD THAT HIT STILL A VERY LARGE IN A VERY RISKY PROJECT SO THAT THE RISK OF THE PROJECT HASN'T NECESSARILY GONE IT'S NOW MEAN THE RISK IT SITS MORE WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S I NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE COMPETITION MARKETS AUTHORITY INTERIM REPORT OUT ON PERCY WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING
WE'RE EXPECTING THEM TO TO THE END ACCUSE ME YEAH WE'RE EXPECTING THE COMPETITION MARKET AUTHORITY TO LOOK AT THE RETAIL END OF ENERGY THEY SORT OF GAVE HER O.K. TO THE GENERATIONS SIDE OF THINGS REALLY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A MARKET YOU'VE GOT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT MARKET HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE TO SWITCH MORE AND SO ON
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT FUEL POVERTY HOW DO IN MORE TIGHTLY DEFINE YOU KNOW WHO IT IS WE NEED TO HELP AND HOW DO WE NEED TO HELP THEM DO THEY NEED A SET TARIFF AND SO ON
SUPERB DAVID ELMS THERE FROM WARWICK LISTER SCHOOL I MARCUS GETS THIS MORNING IS NICK BALOO ISH FROM AND BUNDI FOR MY FINANCE THERE QUICKLY THAT'S RIGHT WINDY GOOD MORNING TO YOU OIL IS BACK OVER FORTY DOLLARS A BARREL BRENT'S HE SURPRISED
I'M NOT SURPRISED I THINK WHAT I AM SURPRISED IS THAT WAS SO EXCITED THAT IT'S BACK OVER FORTY COS IF YOU CAST YOUR MIND BACK AT SIX MONTHS PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK OR EVEN GET TO FORTY BUT WE WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO TWENTY EIGHT BUT A COUPLE OF INTERESTING THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PAST
A FEW WEEKS I MEAN FIRST OF ALL THE REASON THAT ALL'S BEEN WEEK IT'S ALL ABOUT SUPPLY AND DEMAND WE'VE HAD FAR TOO MUCH SUPPLY DEMAND HAS BEEN O.K. SHE LAST YEAR
BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED I THINK LOOKING INTO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT DEMAND MIGHT FALL PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF EMERGING MARKETS AND ALSO BECAUSE SHE MARKETS THE CHINESE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS IS UNDER WAY AND THAT SEEMS TO HAVE DRIVEN UP WITH A LOT OF COMMODITIES
THAT'S BEEN QUITE IMPORTANT COS THAT GOES TO DEMAND SO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE COME OUT I THINK WAS QUITE A BALANCE AND PRANK MASS EXCESSIVE TARGETS AND POLICIES AND PEOPLE OF TRANSLATING THAT INTO MORE DEMAND FOR COMMODITIES AND OIL SO THAT'S BEEN PRETTY HELPFUL AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE THE OTHER THING THAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT
ALL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN VERY CLEVER ABOUT REDUCING COSTS IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS WHICH HAS TAKEN EVERYBODY BY SURPRISE AND THIS IS REALLY STOPS SUPPLY FROM FALLING
BUT IN THE END PRICES HAVE BECOME SO LOW NOW THAT OIL COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY BEEN CUT BACK SUPPLIES SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE FIRST COURSE OR REPORTING SEASON AND IN THE U.S. IT'S BEEN REALLY DRAMATIC ALL COMPANY SPENDING HAS COME DOWN BY MORE THAN HALF
AND OF COURSE THE NUMBER OF YOU WELL SORT OF BEING DRILLED AND OWL BEING TO FULL QUITE SHARPLY AND IF YOU ROLL THAT FORWARD IT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT HALF A MILLION BARRELS A DAY OF OIL PRODUCTION IN NORTH AMERICA IS GOING TO GO AWAY SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A MUCH MORE BALANCED MARKET AND THEREFORE PRICES CAN COME UP A BIT FINAL QUESTION BANK OF ENGLAND TAKING STEPS TO PROVIDE EXTRA LIQUIDITY IN THE RUN UP TO AND AFTER THE E.U. REFERENDUM I PRESUME IT'S A PRECAUTION REACT
WELL WE HOPE SO I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN JUNE FOR A LOT OF VOTERS OUT THERE PEOPLE LISTENING NOW THAT HAVEN'T MADE THEIR MIND UP AND THEN HE'S HAVE THE FAX PUT IN FRONT OF THEM AND I THINK UNTIL THE FACTS ARE PUT IN FRONT OF THEM AND WE GET A SENSE OF WHERE THIS IS ALL GOING TO GO IT'S VERY SENSIBLE FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO BE ON STAND BY WITH A BIT MORE LIQUID SEA WE HAD A BIT OF A FIRE DRILL IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WHEN BORIS JOHNSON CAME OUT AND SAID THAT HE WAS IN FAVOUR OF BRECHT'S WENT STRAIGHT TO ONE THIRTY EIGHT
SO THE BANK OF ENGLAND KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME RISK TO THEIR CURRENCY I SHOULD THIS'LL GO IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SO I THINK VERY PRAGMATIC AND SENSIBLE ON THE BANKS BUT THANK YOU THAT'S NICK MEL WISH THERE FROM MONDAY NOW ON TO EMPLOYMENT AND HIRING A REPORT FROM RECRUITMENT FIRM OR MANPOWER SUGGESTS THAT SOME EMPLOYERS ARE PLANNING TO CUT BACK ON OVERTIME OR TRIMMED THAT OTHER PAY PACKETS TO COPE WITH THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WHICH COMES INTO EFFECT FROM NEXT MONTH JAMES HIT IS MANAGING DIRECTOR AT MANPOWER
RETAIL SECTOR CONTINUES TO HIRE STRONGLY ALTHOUGH WE ARE SEEING SOME FACTORS THAT MAY DENT THAT THAT BEING THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WHICH IS SOME RETAIL EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING TO OFFSET THE HIKE IN THEIR PAY
BY LEVEL IN WAGES BY REDUCING OVER TIME AND WEEKEND WORK AND OTHER SHIFT PREMIUMS THAT ACTUALLY THEIR NET PAY BILL WILL BE AROUND ABOUT THE SAME NOW THIS MAY BE A GENERAL OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THEIR PAY BURDEN TODAY BUT OBVIOUSLY THINGS WILL CATCH UP OVER A PERIOD OF TIME PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE LOOKING TO TAKE ON YOUNGER EMPLOYERS AND STAY OUT OF THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE PAY BRACKET
BY THE STREAM TAKE THE M.D. AT MANPOWER JUST TO BRING YOU BACK IN NICK FROM A MONDAY DO YOU THINK THIS NATIONAL LIVING WAGE IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON RETAILERS IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON RETAILERS SO WE CAN SEE IT NOW A FEW LISTEN TO WHAT THE C.E.O.S OF THE BIG SUPERMARKETS SAINSBURY'S AND TESCO SAY I MEAN THIS IS AN EXTRA BUSINESS COST FOR THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE IN RETAIL AS ELSEWHERE GET PAID
A WAGE WHICH IS GOING TO ENABLE THEM TO LIVE WELL THAT THEMSELVES AND OF COURSE THAT TRANSLATES AS WELL AND HOW THEY BEHAVE IN THE WORKPLACE SO IF YOU PAY PEOPLE WELL THEY GIVE YOU BETTER SERVICE AND ULTIMATELY CUSTOMERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO COME BACK TO YOUR STORES SO IT DOES CUT BOTH WAYS BUT IT IS AN EXTRA COST ITEM IN THE SHORT TERM I CAN'T THINKS THAT INSPECTION PICTURE THOUGHT THERE NICK
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF WOMEN ON COMPANY BOARD HAS LONG BEEN AN ASPIRATION OF GOVERNMENT AND CAMPAIGNERS BUT STILL THERE IS AND THEY'RE A HANDFUL RUNNING U.K.'S BIGGEST FIRMS AND ABOUT NINETY PER CENT OF FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED EXECUTIVES ARE MEN WITH TODAY BEING INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF REPORTS SUGGESTING THAT SITUATION NEEDS TO CHANGE OF HEADHUNTERS EGON SENDER ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PLACING CLOSE TO HALF OF ALL C.E.O.S AND CHAIRMAN OF FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES
MANAGING PARTNER MIRANDA POLLED IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TWENTY FIVE BY TWENTY FIVE INITIATIVE OR PLANNED TO HAVE TWENTY FIVE FEMALE C.E.O.S IN FOOTY ONE HUNDRED FIRMS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE
I THINK OUR ATTENTION HAS BEEN ATTRACTED MUCH MORE TO BOARD LEVEL THAN IT HAS BEEN TO EXECUTIVE LEVEL AND WE ARE STILL SEEING QUITE A LOT OF WOMEN EXITING THE WORKPLACE AT QUITE AN EARLY AGE THAT MEANS THAT AS YOU GET INTO THE MIDDLE LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WOMEN THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING A CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE LED DEBATE WITHIN COMPANIES BUT THERE JUST ISN'T THE POOL OF TALENT AVAILABLE
ORGANISATIONS HAVEN'T NECESSARILY BEING AS QUICK TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP THOSE WITH POTENTIAL RESEARCHER TODAY SUGGESTS THAT BUSINESSES LED BY WOMEN ARE SOME OF THE FASTEST GROWING IN THE U.K. AND CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN TWO BILLION POUNDS TO THE ECONOMY LAST YEAR BUT THEY'RE STILL OUR CONCERNS ACCORDING TO THE TECH ENTREPRENEUR BARONESS MARTHA LANE FOX
WHEN YOU CUT THEIR NUMBERS BY THE TECH SECTOR IT'S MORE DEPRESSING THERE ARE FAR FEWER WOMEN RUNNING FOUND AND FOUNDING INTERNET BUSINESSES UNDER TEN PER CENT OF INTERNET COMPANIES A FOUNDED BY WOMEN IF YOU LOOK AT THEM TO CAPITAL COMMUNITY IT'S ABOUT NINE PER CENT AND THE NUMBERS OVERALL OF WOMEN WORKING IN TEXAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN PERCENT
A SMALLER PERCENTAGE THAN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN PARLIAMENT BUT I THINK THE OVERWHELMING MESSAGE IS THAT WOMEN ARE FANTASTICALLY GOOD INVESTMENTS ALL THE DATA FROM TODAY'S RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WOMEN LED BUSINESSES SCALE UP THEIR FAST GROWING THEY DELIVER A GREAT RETURN I THINK THE U.K. HAS AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GRAB THIS AND OWN IT AND DRIVE MUCH MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY SECTOR BY PUTTING WOMEN AT THE HEART OF IT
THE TEXT SECTOR IS SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED BY HER OWN ADMISSION PEOPLE FIND A BIT SURPRISING BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONE SECTOR OF THE CHICK SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE FLEXIBLE WORKING YOU SHOULD BE AT WORK A LOT MORE FROM HOME AND NOT BE TETHERED TO A PHYSICAL VENUE SUCH AS TRADITIONAL MANUFACTURING MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE I FIND IT VERY SURPRISING TOO THERE'S A HEROINE OF MIND GAME STEPHANIE SHIRLEY SHE STARTED A BUSINESS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES NINETEEN SIXTIES HAD TWO THOUSAND WOMEN WORKING FROM HOME PROGRAMMING
VERY COMPLICATED BITS OF STUFF I LIKE THE BLACK BOX THE CONCORD IN THE POLARIS SUBMARINE I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK BACK TO LOOK FORWARDS AND TAKE INSPIRATION FROM DAME STEPHANIE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS WE COULD DEPLOY WOMEN INTO THE TECH WORKFORCE WE HAVE THE SKILLS CRISIS IN THE TECH SECTOR WE NEED TALENT I THINK WE NEED TO BE MORE IMAGINATIVE IN ADDRESSING IT AS SUCH I DO THEY NEED A TAX INCENTIVES DO THEY NEED A SPECIAL WORK EMPLOYMENT EXEMPTIONS
I'M TRYING TO GET A FIGURE WHAT CAN BE DONE I THINK WE PROBABLY NEED TO HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS AND DIFFERENT IDEAS BUT SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT I THINK MIGHT WORK OR ENCOURAGING A BIG NEW SKILLING UP PROGRAMME FOR WOMEN WHO ARE CURRENTLY NOT IN WORK WE WANT TO GET BACK INTO WORK TO SHOW THE ADVANTAGES OF LEARNING WHERE THE STATE PAY FOR BASED IT OR EVEN PERHAPS PAID FOR BY THE COMPANIES THAT NEED TO FILL THEIR TECH TALENTS SHORTAGES MARTHA LANE FOX

SERVICES ARE BEING HELD IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES TO REMEMBER THE PASSENGERS AND CREW ON A MALAYSIAN PLANE WHICH WENT MISSING OVER THE INDIAN OCEAN TWO YEARS AGO TODAY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PEOPLE WERE ON BOARD FIED IMAGE THREE SEVENTY WHEN IT DISAPPEARED BETWEEN KUALA LUMPUR AND BEIJING THE TIME IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN A LACK OF ACCOMMODATION FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS IS PUSHING THE SYSTEM DESIGNED TO FIND THEM HOUSING TO BREAKING POINT
THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAMME HAS FOUND A REPORTER SEE MACA TOUCH HAS BEEN LOOKING AT DOCUMENTS FROM ONE OF THE PRIVATE COMPANIES CONTRACTED TO DO THIS WHAT DO THEY SHOW SEEMA WANNA SHOUT JUST A BIT OF BACKGROUND FIRST LAST WEEK WE HEARD FROM THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE THAT THERE WAS AN IMPENDING SHORTAGE OF HOUSING FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS IN THE COUNTRY NOW I'VE SEEN SEVERAL PRIVATE DOCUMENTS SUGGEST THE SYSTEM IS AT BREAKING POINT
THE PAPER IS FROM ONE OF THE COMPANIES IN CHARGE OF HOUSING ASYLUM SEEKERS DESCRIBED THE SYSTEM WAS DESPERATE IT'S GETTING WORSE AND IN NEED OF CHANGE NOW ON TOP OF THIS MICHELLE I'VE SPENT THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS SPEAKING TO SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THESE COMPANIES MOST ARE IN MANAGEMENT AND THEY ECHO WHAT THESE DOCUMENTS SAY THAT THE SITUATION IS SO BAD
ANY DAY NOW THEY WILL HAVE TO TURN ASYLUM SEEKERS AWAY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO PUT THEM ALREADY HUNDREDS ARE APPARENTLY BEING PLACED IN HOTELS BECAUSE IF THIS SHORTAGE THAT IS IS IT DESPERATE BECAUSE WE HAD AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ASYLUM APPLICATIONS LAST YEAR ALL BECAUSE LARGELY THERE ARE ONLY CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE COUNCILS ARE PREPARED TO HOUSE THEM OR YOU TOUCH ON THERE TOO
MAIN ISSUES YES THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ASYLUM SEEKERS BECAUSE OF THE MIGRATION CRISIS BUT WHAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME I'M ALSO THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE TOUCHED ON THEIR REPORT LAST WEEK IS THAT BASICALLY THESE COMPANIES HAVE TO FIND SUITABLE ACCOMMODATION BUT WHAT THEY NEED AT THE END OF THE DAY HIS PERMISSION FROM THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THESE PEOPLE CLAIM THAT SEVERAL LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE REFUSING TO TAKE THEIR SHARE OF ASYLUM SEEKERS AND THAT'S LEAVING OTHERS WHO ACTUALLY DO TAKE THEM
TO DEAL WITH THE BURDEN OF HOUSING THEM AND WOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT IF THEY WEREN'T PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT HAD THE JOB OF FINDING THIS COS THAT'S RELATIVELY NEW THE HAPPENED IN ABOUT TWENTY TWELVE ALL WE DO KNOW THAT THEY'RE MAKING A LOSS WE DO KNOW THAT THEY'RE MAKING A HUGE FINANCIAL LOSS ALL THREE OF THEM THREE COMPANIES ARE G. FOUR S. SERCO AND CLEAR SPRINGS G.FOUR.S. HIS FIGURES ARE DUE OUT TOMORROW WE'RE EXPECTING THEM TO SAY AROUND THIRTY TO FORTY MILLION LAST WE KNOW CLEAR SPRINGS HAS MADE
SORRY SIR CLIVE MADE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IN LOSSES SO YES I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY DO WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS CONTRACT AND THAT COULD BE A REASON WHY THEY ARE MAKING A FUSS ABOUT IT BUT WE ALSO DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE SAID LAST WEEK THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE A LOST IN SURE JUST TO SAY THAT THE HOME OFFICE SAYS IT DOES CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE WINDS RAGE OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AREAS THAT ACCOMMODATE AND SUPPORT PEOPLE SEEKING ASYLUM AND PROTECTION WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE CHAIR OF THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE KEITH HOURS AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK SEEMA THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE'S TALK OF A BREAKTHROUGH AT A SUMMIT BETWEEN THE E.U. AND TURKEY IN BRUSSELS BUT A FINAL DECISION WILL BE TAKEN UNTIL THEY MEET AGAIN AT THE END OF NEXT WEEK A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS IS IN BRUSSELS AND CHRIS THERE'S TALK OF THE GAME CHANGER IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BEING THIS IDEA OF ONE IN ONE OUT
AND IT WAS A BIG SURPRISE SARAH A SURPRISE TO MANY OF THE NATIONAL LEADERS AS THEY SAT DOWN IN THE SUMMIT ROOM YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THERE HAVE BEEN PLANS AFOOT TO SEND BACK ALL NON SYRIANS WHO ARRIVED ON THE GREEK ISLANDS FROM TURKEY BUT THIS NEW TURKISH PROPOSAL WHICH EMERGED AFTER SIX HOURS OF TALKS ON SUNDAY NIGHT BETWEEN THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER AND ANGELA MERKEL IS TO SEND BACK
EVERYONE WHO ARRIVES IN A REGULAR WAY ON THE GREEK ISLANDS INCLUDING SYRIANS IT IS IF YOU LIKE THE MAXIMUM LEGAL DETERRENT THEY COULD DRAW UP IF YOU COME TO THE ISLANDS BY A REGULAR MEANS ON ONE OF THE SMALL RUBBER BOATS PROVIDED BY SMUGGLERS YOU WILL BE SENT BACK AND THEN HE WILL BE AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE QUEUE FOR A HUGE RESETTLEMENT SCHEME THAT IN PARALLEL GERMANY AND OTHERS ARE WILLING TO PUT INTO PRACTICE IN THAT SCHEME MEANS THAT'S THE ONE FOR ONE FOR EVERY SYRIAN THAT GETS SENT BACK FROM THE GREEK ISLANDS TO TURKEY ANOTHER SYRIAN CITIZEN WILL BE RESETTLED DIRECTLY FROM REFUGEE CAMPS IN TURKEY STRAIGHT INTO THE Y. YOU A LEGAL ROUTE INTO THE E.U.
RATHER THAN THE ILLEGAL ROUTES WE HAD BEEN SEEING OVER THE PAST YEAR I SPOKE TO THE HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER'S SPOKESMAN AND IT'S AN INTERVIEW WILL HERE JUST AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING IN WHICH HE MADE IT CLEAR HOW UNHAPPY THEY ARE WITH THIS IDEA OF THE Y. YOU ACCEPTING EFFECTIVELY MORE MIGRANTS AND THAT THEY WERE PREPARED TO VETO ANY DAY
IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE THAT IT BE SOMETHING THAT ALL COUNTRIES WOULD TAKE PART IN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE VOLUNTARY GERMANY AND OTHERS THROUGHOUT THIS DEAL WE HAVE TO EMPHASISE THERE ARE LOTS OF WOODS AND COATS LOTS OF MITES AND MAYBE IT'S NOT AGREED YET IT'S A SET OF BROAD PRINCIPLES THE DETAILS HAVE TO BE ALL FILLED IN THERE TRYING TO DO THAT IN THE NEXT TEN DAYS AND THEN OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
IMPLEMENTED AND I THINK THERE IS THERE'S A GAMBLE AT THE HEART OF IT AND THAT GAMBLE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT DETERRENCE WILL WORK AND VIRTUALLY NO ONE WILL RISK GOING TO THE GREEK ISLANDS BY BOAT ANY MORE SO IF YOU DON'T SEND MANY PEOPLE BACK AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO
RESETTLE MANY FROM THIS NEW LEGAL METHOD I THINK IF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE KEPT ARRIVING ON THE ISLAND TO COME WHAT MAY IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE IMPOSSIBLE PRACTICALLY LOGISTICALLY TO SEND THEM ALL BACK EVEN THOUGH THAT IN EFFECT IS WHAT THIS DRAFT AGREEMENT THREATENS TO DO CHRIS MORRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE HEAD OF G. C. H. Q. HAS CALLED FURRED GOVERNMENT AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO WORK TOGETHER IN DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT COME FROM ENCRYPTION GORDON KARA IS A SECURITY CORRESPONDENT AND GORDON I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD START WITH A SORT OF A DESCRIPTION OF ENCRYPTION AND WHAT IT MEANS TO ALL OF US QUITE ENCRYPTION IS IS THE WAY IN WHICH DATA IS ENCODED OR SCRAMBLED SO IT MAKES IT POTENTIALLY UNREADABLE TO OTHER PEOPLE
THIS IS THE SUBJECT OF AN ENORMOUS LEGAL BATTLE IN THE U.S. BETWEEN APPLE IN THE F.B.I. BECAUSE APPLE HAS BEEN BUILDING DEVICES PHONES WHERE THE DATA IS ENCRYPTED SO THAT NO ONE CAN READ IT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE AT THE PASSCODE INCLUDING APPLE ITSELF SO WHEN THE PHONE OF ONE OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE SAN BERNARDINO ATTACKS WERE SEIZED BY THE STATE AND THE STATE AND THE F.B.I. LAW ENFORCEMENT GO TO APPLE AND SAY UNLOCK THIS PHONE APPLE SAY WE CAN'T IT'S ENCRYPTED
AND SO THIS ISSUE OF TECH COMPANIES BUILDING ENCRYPTION WHICH MEANS THAT THE STATE CAN'T GET INTO THE PHONE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR INSTANCE IS BECOMING ONE OF THE HOT TOPICS IN PUBLIC POLICY A TECHNICAL ISSUE WHICH IS BECOMING A REALLY SERIOUS PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE
AND A REALLY INTERESTING INTERVENTION FROM ROBERT HALLIGAN HERE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HE WHEN HE TOOK OVER AS THE HEAD OF G.C.H.Q. IN NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN LAUNCHED WHAT WAS SEEN AS A MAJOR ATTACK ON THE TECH COMPANIES HE DESCRIBED THEM AS BECOMING THE COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTRES OF CHOICE FOR TERRORIST GROUPS YET NOW IN A SPEECH IN THE U.S. AND I THINK THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING AS WELL HE'S BASICALLY OFFERING A MUCH MORE CONCILIATORY TONE SAYING WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE OF ENCRYPTION
I WAS MISINTERPRETED AS ATTACKING THE TICK CHECK INDUSTRY HE SAYS AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND SOLUTIONS BY WORKING TOGETHER WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE TONE THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE U.S. BETWEEN APPLE IN THE F.B.I. WITH A BIG LEGAL BATTLE AS WELL AT THE MOMENT ON THIS SUBJECT OF COURSE IF YOU MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO RELEASE UNSCRAMBLE SOMETHING OR DEAL WITH ENCRYPTION
IT MIGHT BE EASIER FOR THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES BUT IT'S ALSO EASIER FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO DO IT FOR BAD REASONS AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE ARGUMENT OF OF COMPANIES LIKE AN APPLE IS THAT HACKERS THERE ARE CRIMINALS WHO WANT TO GET INTO PHONES AND BY MAKING STRONG ENCRYPTION ON THEM BUT PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO STEAL DATA AND I THINK THERE'S A RECOGNITION FROM G.C.H.Q. AS WELL THAT THERE
STANCE AT LEAST OF THE WAY IT'S BEEN PERCEIVED IN THE PUBLIC SPACE HAS BEEN TO EMPHASISE THE WORK OF TRYING TO GET INTO DEVICES AND NOT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ALSO IN CHARGE OF CYBER SECURITY SO PROTECTING COMPANIES INDIVIDUAL TO THE STATE FROM HACKERS SOMETIMES HAPPENS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TRYING TO STEAL A CORPORATE PRIVATE INFORMATION
AND SO I THINK THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT THEY NEED TO TO MAKE THE CASE THAT ENCRYPTION IS GOOD BUT THERE BUT I THINK WHAT ABOUT HANNIGAN'S ARGUMENT IS IS THAT ULTIMATELY THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE THE BOUNDARY SHOULD LINE THIS SUBJECT WHAT THE PARAMETER SHOULD BE SHOULD BE NEITHER FUR
SPY CHIEFS LIKE HIM TO SET NOR TECH COMPANIES TO SET BUT FOR POLITICIANS TO SET THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT BECOMES QUITE INTERESTING AS WE HAVE BEEN THE POWERS BILL IN THE U.K. WHICH IS TRYING TO DO THAT BUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH TECH COMPANIES WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD PRODUCTS WHICH DON'T OFFER ANY SOLUTIONS FOR THE STATE TO GET INTO I THINK MAY WELL CONTINUE GORDON CARRARA THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THERE IS A DARK CARTOON IN THE INDEPENDENT THIS MORNING ENCAPSULATING SOME OF THE CRITICISM OF THE E. USE APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THE MIGRANT CRISIS AND WHAT HAS BEEN SEEN BY SOME AS A VAULT FAST BY THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL THEY'VE BROWN HAS DEPICTED MISSUS MERKEL DRESSED IN THE UNIFORM OF A BORDER GUARD WEARING A BLUE SLEEVELESS JACKET EMBLAZONED WITH THE E.U.

SCANDAL VICTIMS AS THE HEADLINE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MIRROR IT SAYS THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT HAS BEEN HUMILIATED AFTER THE WOMAN APPOINTED TO BE WHAT THE PAPER DESCRIBES AS THE NEW N.H.S. WHISTLEBLOWER TSAR HAS WALKED AWAY FROM THE ROLE JUST WEEKS BEFORE SHE WAS DUE TO START

IT'S NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT TURKEY HAS AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO TAKE BACK EVERY ILLEGAL MARGARET HE TRIES TO ENTER THE E.U. FROM ITS SHORES WHILE AS E.U. NATIONS AND TURKEY GATHERED IN BRUSSELS TO CONSIDER HOW TO HANDLE THE ONGOING MIGRANT CRISIS HAD REACHED THAT DEAL THE DEFENCE SECRETARY HERE TOLD EM PEAS THE ROYAL NAVY HAD JOINED A NATO MISSION IN THE AEGEAN SEA
BUT M.P.S EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT COULD LEAVE THAT THAT COULD LEAVE OTHER ROUTES UNCHECKED HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRENT TRAVELLING ACROSS TURKEY ISN'T THE ONLY WAY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TRY TO GET TO EUROPE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS ARE STILL SMUGGLING PEOPLE FROM LIBYA TO ITALY THEY TIMOROUS ENTERPRISE ENTERPRISES STILL ON STATION IN THE TIRING IN YOU AND INDEED YES I AM JUST YESTERDAY RESCUED AROUND ONE HUNDRED
THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON HAD BEEN FORCED TO MAKE A STATEMENT AFTER A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT FORMER MINISTER ALISTAIR CARMICHAEL ASKED AN URGENT QUESTION ABOUT THE DECISION TO SEND FOUR BRITISH VESSELS TO JOIN A NATO MISSION AGAINST SMUGGLERS WHO ARE TAKING PEOPLE FROM TURKEY TO GREECE
MISTER CARMICHAEL SAID THE WAY TO WIN THE WAR AGAINST THE TRAFFICKERS WAS TO CUT OFF THE SUPPLY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE DESPERATE ENOUGH TO PAY TO GET TO EUROPE AND OF COURSE THAT MEANS IN THE LONGER TERM GRIPPING PIECE IN THEIR COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN
BUT IN THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM SURELY THAT MEANS THERE ARE C.D.S OFF SAFE AND LEGAL ROUTES INTO EUROPE
EXPANSION OF THE REFUGEE FAMILY SCHEME AND INTRODUCTION OF HUMANITARIAN
MICHAEL FALLON AGREED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CUTTING OFF THE PEOPLE TRAFFICKERS SUPPLY SO FAR AS THE CREATION OF SAY FRUITS IS CONCERNED I'M NOT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT ESTABLISHING SOME ROOTS OF SOFA THAN OTHERS WILL DO ANYTHING
TO REDUCE THE FLOW ON THE CONTRARY I THINK WE NEED TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY PARTICULARLY OF THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES AND THE TURKISH COAST GUARD TO BE ABLE TO INTERCEPT THESE BIRDS BEFORE THEY SET OFF ON WHAT IS A VERY VERY DANGEROUS CROSS
THE LABOUR FORMER SHADOW HOME SECRETARY YVETTE COOPER WHO CHAIRS HER PARTY'S REFUGEE TASK FORCE WHAT DID THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO HELP PEOPLE WHO WERE ALREADY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
THERE ARE THIRTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM NOW AT THE MACEDONIAN BORDER IN TERRIBLE
AND DAMP AND COLD CONDITIONS CHILDREN WITH BRONCHITIS
HE HAS SAID THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WON'T DO ANYTHING TO TAKE ANY OF THEM WHERE DOES HE THINK THOSE THIRTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE SHOULD GO
MICHAEL FALLON SAID EUROPE HAD TO ADOPT A MORE SENSIBLE POLICY AND HE SAID SOME REFUGEES FROM SYRIA HAD ARRIVED IN THE U.K. A CONSERVATIVE CHRISTOPHER JOB WASN'T CONVINCED THAT TURKEY WAS DOING ENOUGH TO HELP ITSELF
THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PLASTIC DINGHIES BEING IMPORTED BY TURKEY FROM CHINA TO ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE AND SIMILAR THEY'RE A PHONEY LIFEJACKETS BEING SOLD IS MERE WHY ISN'T THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
THE DEFENCE SECRETARY AGREED THAT THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT COULD DO MORE BUT HE SAID SO COULD OTHER GOVERNMENTS WHEN HIS STATEMENT WAS REPEATED IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS FOR FORMER LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER LORD ASHDOWN COMPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY WAS TO RESCUE REFUGEES AND THEN ABANDON THEM HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT WILL NOT TAKE A SINGLE ONE ON A SINGLE ONE OF THE REFUGEES NOW FLEEING FROM THEIR LIVES FROM THE SYRIAN BATTLEFIELDS BUT WE'RE PERFECTLY HAPPY OF COURSE TO CRITICISE EUROPE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO COPE WITH A MILLION
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO USE THE WORD HYPOCRISY IN THIS JAIL MY LORD SO LET ME JUST CONFINE MYSELF TO SAYING DOES THE MINISTER NOT FIND THAT OVERALL THAT'S A PRE DISCREDITABLE POLLEN
DAD'S ANGRY STUFF BY THE STANDARDS OF THE UPPER HOUSE BUT LORD ASHDOWN'S COMMENT CAME AT THE END OF AN AFTERNOON OF STRONG WORDS AND EMOTIONS JUST A SHORT TIME EARLIER PIERS HAD RELUCTANTLY BACK DOWN IN A ROW WITH THE COMMONS OVER PLANS TO CUT EMPLOYMENT AND SUPPORT ALLOWANCE PAID TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO SICK OR DISABLED TO WORK BY THIRTY POUNDS A WEEK FOR MANY NEW CLAIMANTS
LAST WEEK WHEN M.P.S OVERTURNED DEFEATS THE GOVERNMENT HAD SUFFERED IN THE LORDS THE COMMONS SPEAKER RULED THAT THE CHANGES WERE A MATTER OF FINANCIAL PRIVILEGE IN OTHER WORDS PEERS HAD GONE TOO FAR ACROSS BENCH OR INDEPENDENT PEER LADY CAMPBELL OF SILVERTON WHO USES A WHEELCHAIR AND A VENTILATOR COMPLAINED THE PARLIAMENTARY PROTOCOL HAD TRUMPED THE NEEDS OF DISABLED PEOPLE
AND I'M SORRY BUT WE DON'T NOT BACK ON THIS
AS THE BAND WOULD BE BRUSHED SOME OF THOSE THRILLERS SEVERELY DISABLED PEOPLE IN BRITAIN AND OVER THERE
THIS FINAL ROUND OF PARLIAMENTARY PING PONG STARTED WHEN PIERS BACK TO CALL FROM ANOTHER INDEPENDENT PEER LORD LOW TO DELAY THE CHANGES NOW HE SAID NOBODY SHOULD THINK THIS WAS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION
THIS IS A BLACK DAY FOR DISABLED PEOPLE
AT THE COMMONS HAVE SPOKEN DECISIVELY AND WE MUST BOW TO THEIR WISHES
WE DO SO UNDER PROTEST THE WORK AND PENSIONS MINISTER LORD FREUD INSISTED THE GOVERNMENT HAD HEARD WHAT ITS OPPONENTS HAD SAID ABOUT THE PLANS NONE OF THE PEERS WHO SPOKE BACK TO THE CHANGES BUT THEY'D RUN OUT OF PARLIAMENTARY OPTIONS THE WAY IS NOW CLEAR FOR THE WELFARE REFORM AND WORK BILL TO BECOME LAW
SEAN CURRAN REPORTING ON WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY YOU CAN HEAR MORE AS USUAL FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT HALF PAST EIGHT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND DIGITAL RADIO IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN SHARES AND THE ENERGY GIANT E.D.F. MOSTLY OWNED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HAVE FALLEN SHARPLY AFTER CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF ITS PLANS TO BUILD A NEW HINKLEY POINT NUCLEAR PLANT IN SOMERSET THE EIGHTEEN BILLION POUND PROJECT WOULD USE NEW TECHNOLOGY NOT YET IN USE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
WE'RE JOINED BY THE NUCLEAR SPECIALIST MALCOLM GRIMSTON FROM IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON CENTRE FOR ENERGY POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY GOOD MORNING MORNING HOW MUCH DO WE NEED THIS PLANT IN ORDER TO TO FULFIL A REQUIREMENT FOR POWER GENERATION
IN THE MIDDLE YEARS OF NEXT DECADE WE HIT A REAL CLIFF EDGE IN TERMS OF OUR EXISTING TECHNOLOGY GOVERNMENT PLANS ARE THAT ALL OF OUR COAL POWERED STATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY PERCENT OF OUR ELECTRICITY SHOULD BE CLOSED BY THEN ABOUT HALF OF OUR NUCLEAR PLANTS WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANOTHER FIFTEEN PER CENT ARE LIKELY TO BE COMING TOWARDS THE END OF THEIR LIVES IN THE MIDDLE YEARS OF NEXT DECADE THOSE HAVE TO BE REPLACED BY SOMETHING AT THAT POINT AND IF WE DON'T WANT TO BECOME
EVEN MORE DEPENDENT ON IMPORTED GAS FROM PLACES LIKE IRAN RUSSIA THEN NUCLEAR LOOKS LIKE THE THE OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVE AT THIS COS THIS WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY WELL IT IS VERY CONSIDERABLE AND THAT'S WHERE THE CHALLENGERS BEAT THESE FUNDING THIS SORT OF PROJECT YOU KNOW MORE OR LESS MARKET CONTACTS THE GOVERNMENT'S GONE REALLY AS FAR AS IT CAN IT'S OFFERING GUARANTEED PRICES FOR A THIRTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD IT'S OFFERING LOAN GUARANTEES
WHICH ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR FOR A NEW NUCLEAR PLANT AND YET WE STILL HAVEN'T GOT TO THE TO THE FUND INVESTMENT DECISION THAT DOES DEMONSTRATE JUST HOW EXPENSIVE BUT ALSO HOW DIFFICULT MANAGING THE PROJECT WHY ALL THESE PROJECTS SO EXPENSIVE THIS ONE IT IS A NEW GENERATION OF NUCLEAR REACTORS BUT
EIGHTEEN BILLION POUNDS IS THAT THE COST OF THE TECHNOLOGY OR THE COST OF THE SCALE OF A PLANT LIKE THIS I MEAN IT IS A BIG PLANT IT'S GOING TO GENERATE SEVEN PERCENT OF OUR ELECTRICITY BUT NONE THE LESS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT AS SAFETY SYSTEM HAS BEEN PILED ON TOP OF SAFETY SYSTEM THIS IS BECOMING ALMOST COMPLEX AS WELL AS HAVING A VAST NUMBER OF PUMPS AND VALVES AND THE LIKE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT GIVEN THAT THE SAFETY RECORD A NEW CLUE
IS SO EXTRAORDINARILY COOKED IN A SINGLE ACCIDENT IN ITS WHOLE HISTORY WHICH HAD HEALTH EFFECTS OFF SITE I'M SCEPTICAL AS TO WHETHER THIS IS REALLY THE WAY FORWARD WE END UP WITH PLANTS THERE MIGHT LOOK EXTREMELY SAFE BUT IF WE CAN'T BUILD THEM HE PUSHES US INTO YOU WE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO REMOVE SOME OF THOSE LAYERS OF SAFETY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEXT GENERATION OF THESE PLANTS ARE BUILT WELL I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO REACH A LEVEL OR SAFETY WHICH I THINK WE'VE REACHED A NUCLEAR INDUSTRY GLOBALLY
WHERE BY FIRSTLY THE CHANCE OF AN ACCIDENT IS EXTREMELY SMALL BUT WE LEARNT FROM SHEENA THAT ACTUALLY THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS ARE NOT THE RADIATION NOBODY CERTAINLY OFF SITE AND PROBABLY EVEN ON THE SITE OF WHO COULD HUMOUR IT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DETECT ANYBODY DYING AS A RESULT OF RADIATION THE EVACUATION HAS KILLED AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THERE DOES COME A POINT WHERE IF THE ALTERNATIVE IS WE HAVE TO USE MORE AND MORE NATURAL GAS WHICH IS
DANGEROUS TO TWO TO WIN AND PRODUCES GREENHOUSE GASES WHICH IS WHERE THE REAL FRIEND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE WE COULD GO FURTHER DOWN THE RENEWABLE ROUTES IN THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTUALLY CUT THE SUBSIDIES FOR THEM OF THE DIFFICULTY WITH RENEWABLES SWINDON SOUL IN PARTICULAR IS THEIR VARIABILITY WHICH MEANS WE CAN'T RELY ON THEM BEING AVAILABLE WHEN WE WANT TO PUMP WATER INTO OUR HOMES WILL HAVE AN OPERATION IN THE HOSPITAL OR RUN A TRANSPORT SYSTEMS SO A ROLE FOR IN YOUR POSH BUT WE DO NEED RELIABLE POWER AND REALLY THAT'S LIKELY TO BE WILL NUCLEAR FALCON GRIMSTON THANK YOU
IT'S SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN WALES NEEDS A WIDE RANGING INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF HOW IT'S HOSPITALS ARE COPING IN THE EVENING AND AT WEEKENDS THAT'S ACCORDING TO WALES'S PUBLIC SERVICES OMBUDSMAN NICK BENNETT HE SAYS HE'S COME ACROSS SEVERAL CASES OF INADEQUATE CARE INCLUDING ONE WHERE PATIENT'S LIFE COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED HAD A SENIOR SURGEON BEEN AVAILABLE ON A SATURDAY WELL NICK BENNETT JOINS US FROM CARDIFF NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING YOU HIGHLIGHT TWELVE EXAMPLES WERE THERE MANY MORE HOW WIDESPREAD THE PROBLEM WAS THIS
THERE WERE MANY MORE THIS IS ONLY A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I'M KEEN TO EMPHASISE YET I AM NOT TRYING TO SCAREMONGER THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALT WITH BY THE N.H.S. IN WALES ARE DEALT WITH VERY WELL HOWEVER IN WALES BECAUSE WE'D EVOLVED WE TEND NOT TO HAVE COMPETITION IN OUR PUBLIC SERVICES RECENTLY WE HAD AN O.E.C.D. REPORT WHICH LOOK TO ENGLAND WALES SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND CONCLUDED THAT BROADLY STANDARDS ACROSS THE FOUR NATIONS ARE SIMILAR BUT IN THE WELSH
BUT A SCENARIO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T HAVE COMPETITION WHERE THERE'S NO CHOICE BUT THEY MUST BE PATIENT VOICE OH KAY BUT THEY HELD MY MARK FOR DRAKE FED SAYS
THAT YOUR REPORT IS POINT OUT JUST TWELVE OF THE MILLIONS OF ADMISSIONS AND ONLY ONE OF THOSE CASES IS FROM THE PAST THREE YEARS WERE CLEARLY I CAN'T IT BECAUSE I'M AT THE END OF THE COMPLAINTS JOURNEY I CANNOT BE REPORTING ON CURRENT LIVE CASES HOWEVER
MY REPORT DOES MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE DO NEED TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT SYSTEMIC REVIEW AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE LISTENING TO THAT TO THE VOICES OF COMPLAINANTS I RECEIVE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS AND EVERY YEAR MANY HUNDREDS OF THEM ABOUT HEALTH SERVICES IN WALES I ACCEPT THAT'S MAJORITY OF CASES BUT NONETHELESS THERE'S SOME
SOME CLEAR COMMON THEMES THAT HAVE EMERGED WHO WAS LOOKING AT HOW TO ABOUT SERVICES IN WALES SUCH AS THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT HAS IMPROVED SUPERVISION OF JUNIUS
AND THAT IS A PRIORITISATION OF IN PATIENT CARE AND IMPROVED HANDOVERS BETTER COMMUNICATION THERE'S REAL SCOPE FOR FOR A BETTER CULTURE I THINK WITHIN THE N.H.S. SOMEWHERE ELSE IN ENGLAND OF COURSE THEY ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE EVENING AND WEEKEND CARE HAVE INVOLVED THIS ROW OVER THE NEW JUNIOR DOCTORS CONTRACT IS NOT HAPPENING IN WALES
DO YOU THINK WHETHER IT'S VILE YOU KNOW MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT MECHANISM BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE YOU HAVE MORE CLINICIANS WORKING OVER THE WEEKEND WELL IT'S IT CAN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SITUATION IN WALES WHAT WE'RE CALLING FOR HERE IS BETTER AND CONSULTANT SUPPORT FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS WHEREAS I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED IN ENGLAND HAS BEEN ENFORCEMENT FOR NEW CONTRACT FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS
I THINK ALSO INCLUDED TALKING ABOUT HAVING I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAVE REFERRED TO IS IT AS A TRULY SEVEN DAY N.H.S. WELL CURRENTLY ENGLAND AND WALES DO HAVE A SEVEN DAY N.H.S. AND TERMS OF EMERGENCY TREATMENT AND FIVE D. N. H. S. WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTIVE TREATMENT I'M NOT
SUGGESTING THERE SHOULD BE ANY CHANGE THAT UP BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THIS PROPER CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR PATIENTS NICK BENNETT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND ALEX DEACONS HERE WITH THE WEATHER

ON THE THIRD OF MARCH NINETEEN NINETY TWO GOVERNMENT OF BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA DECLARED INDEPENDENCE
OPEN WARFARE BEGAN WITH HIM
MICHAEL PALIN TELLS THE STORY OF A GROUP OF REFUGEES WELCOMED IN BY A SMALL SOMERSET TOWN WE HAD SIX DAYS TO PREPARE TO GET A BUS TOGETHER AND GO OUT THERE I JUST COULDN'T SEE HOW THE TRIUMPH OF DECENT INSTINCTS WOULD WIN THROUGH OVER THE HORRORS OF THE WAR
THE DAY THE REFUGEES CAME ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON AT HALF PAST ONE AND THEN AVAILABLE ON THE B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WEBSITE
IN THE NEXT HOUR OF THIS PROGRAMME WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF NATO ON ITS MISSION TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS IN THE G. AND C. ALSO COULD UNDECIDED WOMEN SWING THE OUTCOME OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM AND THE FOUNDER OF THE MOTOWN RECORD LABEL LAUNCHES HIS OWN MUSICAL THAT'S COMING UP AT ABOUT TWENTY TO EIGHT
YOU ARE LISTENING TO TODAY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WITH MICHELLE HUSSAIN AND SARAH MONTAGUE
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY THE EIGHTH OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THE E.U. AND TURKEY HAVE AGREED THE TERMS OF A WIDE RANGING DEAL DESIGNED TO STEM THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS INTO EUROPE THE WORLD'S MOST HIGHLY PAID FEMALE ATHLETE THE TENNIS CHAMPION MARIA SHARAPOVA HAS APOLOGISED AFTER FAILING A DRUGS TEST AND IT'S EMERGED THAT BORIS JOHNSON'S STAFF HAVE BEEN TOLD TO SUPPORT HIS POSITION IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM OR REMAIN SILENT
B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE E.U. LEADERS ENDED THEIR SUMMIT WITH TURKEY LAST NIGHT BY HOLDING OUT THE PROSPECT OF AN END TO SCENES OF MIGRANTS CROSSING THE AEGEAN SEA IN MAKESHIFT BOATS IN A DESPERATE BID TO REACH EUROPE AFTER TALKS IN BRUSSELS LASTING MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS TURKEY AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO TAKE BACK EVERY ILLEGAL MIGRANTS FROM THE GREEK ISLANDS IN RETURN FOR AN E. YOU PROMISED TO RESETTLE A SIMILAR NUMBER OF SYRIANS FROM ITS OWN CAMPS
THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER MET THE BEAUTIFULLY DESCRIBED THE PROPOSALS AS A BOLD STEP WI THESE
GAME CHANGING POSITION IN FACT OUR OBJECTIVITY IS TO THIS COURAGE
ILLEGAL MIGRATION TO PREVENT HUMUS MAG LOOSE TO HEAD PUGH POOL HALL WANT TO COME TO THAT EUROPE SO ENCOURAGING
NIKO MIGRATION IS SIMPLER
HOWEVER TURKEY HAS ATTACH CONDITIONS TO THE DEAL WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED AT ANOTHER E.U. SUMMIT NEXT WEEK THEY INCLUDE SPEEDING UP ITS E.U. MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION AND BRINGING FORWARD VISA FREE TRAVEL DAVID CAMERON SAID THE MEASURES PROVIDED THE BASIS FOR A BREAKTHROUGH IN THE MIGRANT CRISIS
WOULD IF WE IMPLEMENTED BREAK THEIR BUSINESS MODEL OF THE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS AND END THE LINK BETWEEN GETTING IN A BOAT AND GETTING SETTLEMENT
IN EUROPE AND THAT IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN ARGUING FOR FREE I THINK THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BUT ONLY IF IT'S FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT THAT WILL MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE
THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK SAID THE DEAL IF APPROVED WOULD INVOLVE COMPREHENSIVE LARGE SCALE AND FAST TRACK RETURNS OF MIGRANTS FROM GREECE TO TURKEY A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS FROM BRUSSELS THIS IS A BOLD INITIATIVE BASED ON A SIMPLE PREMISE ALL IRREGULAR MIGRANTS ENTERING THE GREEK ISLANDS FROM TURKEY INCLUDING SYRIANS WOULD BE SENT BACK
BUT FOR EVERY SYRIAN CITIZEN RETURNED ANOTHER SYRIAN WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RESETTLEMENT IN THE E.U. DIRECTLY FROM A REFUGEE CAMP IN TURKEY ANYONE ATTEMPTING AN ILLEGAL CROSSING WOULD GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE QUEUE
DONALD TUSK SAID IT SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE THE DAYS OF THE REGULAR MIGRATION TO EUROPE WERE OVER
THERE ARE PLENTY OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL PITFALLS AHEAD SO FAR THE AGREEMENT AS A SERIES OF BROAD PRINCIPLES AND THE DETAIL WILL AWAIT ANOTHER SUMMIT AT THE END OF NEXT WEEK FIERCE ARGUMENT COULD ENSUE AND IMPLEMENTATION WOULD NOT BE EASY
THE E. YOU NEED TURKEYS CO OPERATION IF IT'S TO BEGIN COPING WITH THE MIGRATION CRISIS SO THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT WOULD ALSO BE GIVEN EXTRA MONEY TO HELP IT HOST NEARLY THREE MILLION SYRIAN REFUGEES AND IF IRREGULAR MIGRATION IS BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL TURKISH CITIZENS COULD BE GIVEN VISA FREE ACCESS TO THE E. USE BORDER FREE SEND AN AREA BEFORE THE END OF JUNE
CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT SEEN BY THIS PROGRAMME WARNED THAT THE SYSTEM FOR HOUSING ASYLUM SEEKING HIS BREAKING POINT ONE OF THE THREE COMPANIES IN CHARGE OF FINDING ACCOMMODATION FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS SAYS THE SHORTAGE OF HOUSING IS RAPIDLY GETTING WORSE SI MC ATTACH TETRA REPORTS

THIS FACILITY NO ONE KNEW IT EXISTED UNTIL WE FOUND OUT DURING AN INSPECTION AND THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT PEOPLE WERE BEING HELD THERE IN COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE CONDITIONS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY THEY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THEY'VE COME FROM AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT CONDITIONS THEY HAD ENDURED ELSEWHERE ON THEIR JOURNEY THE FACT IS THAT ONCE THEY ARRIVED IN THIS COUNTRY THEY SHOULD BE TREATED WITH DECENCY THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED THAT THE SITUATION WAS UNACCEPTABLE BUT IT SAID IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED AND FACILITIES HAD IMPROVED

I KNOW THOUGH WITH THIS WAY IF THOSE CONSEQUENCES AND I DON'T WANNA AND MY CAREER THIS WAY AND I REALLY HOPE THAT I WILL BE GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE TO PLAY IN A SCALE
THE DRUG IN QUESTION IS MULL DOWNING UM IT'S USED TO TREAT HEART CONDITIONS SUCH AS I'M CHINA BUT IN HEALTHY PEOPLE IT CAN BOOST ENDURANCE LEVELS MARIA SHARAPOVA SAYS THE DRUG WAS LEGALLY PRESCRIBED TO HER BY HER FAMILY DOCTOR FOR OVER TEN YEARS CRUCIALLY SHE CLAIMED SHE WAS UNAWARE THAT HAD BEEN DECLARED A PROHIBITED SUBSTANCE AT THE START OF THIS YEAR
SENIOR OFFICIALS WORKING WITH THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON HAD BEEN TOLD NOT TO SPEAK OUT IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AN EMAIL FROM THE MAYOR'S CHIEF OF STAFF SEEN BY THE B. B. C. SAYS THEY SHOULD EITHER BACK HIS POSITION OR AVOID OPPOSING IT IN PUBLIC HERE'S OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG BORIS JOHNSON HAS NOT JUST DECIDED TO CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS TO DO SO LOUDLY AND PROUDLY
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS HE ACCUSED THOSE WHO WANT TO STAY IN THE E.U. OF CRUSHING DISSENT ACTING AS AGENTS OF PROJECT FEAR CALLING INSTEAD FOR AN OPEN DEBATE BUT IN LESS COLOURFUL BUT NO LESS MEANINGFUL LANGUAGE AN EMAIL SEEN BY THE B. B. C. FROM HIS CHIEF OF STAFF SENT JUST A DAY BEFORE THOSE COMMENTS WARNS HIS SENIOR TEAM OF DEPUTY MAYOR'S AND ADVISERS NOT TO ATTACK MISTER JOHNSON'S PRO EXIT POSITION IN PUBLIC
EDWARD LISTER WROTE I WOULD EXPECT YOU EITHER TO ADVOCATE THE MAYOR'S POSITION OR OTHERWISE NOT OPENLY TO CONTRADICT IT A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MAYOR SAID THAT HE WAS RELAXED ABOUT HIS ADVISORS EXPRESSING DIFFERENT VIEWS WHEN THEY'RE NOT ON PUBLIC BUSINESS AND THAT THE ADVICE IN THE EMAIL WAS IN LINE WITH OFFICIAL CITY HALL RULES
WITHIN THE PAST FEW MINUTES N. POWER HAS CONFIRMED THAT IT'S CUTTING TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED JOBS IT'S REPORTED LOSSES OF OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS
THE AMERICAN SINGER SONGWRITER CAROLE KING HAS ANNOUNCED HER FIRST CONCERT IN THE U.K. FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE SEVENTY FOUR YEAR OLD WHOSE HITS INCLUDE IT'S TOO LATE AND YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND WILL HEADLINE THE B'S TEA FESTIVAL AT HYDE PARK IN LONDON IN JULY SHALL PLAYING HER LANDMARK NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE ALBUM TAPESTRY FROM BEGINNING TO END FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE SAYS SHE'S RELISHING THE PROSPECT
AND HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO ASK ME TO DO IT IN A TENT HOW FROM BEGINNING TO END AND I ACTUALLY LOVE THE GOOD AND THE WHOLE THING IS JUST VERY VERY TO ME I AM I REALLY AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT TALKIN IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN
THEY MAY NOT HAVE SIGNED OFF ON IT YET BUT LAST NIGHT THE E.U. AND TURKEY AGREED THE BROAD OUTLINE OF A DEAL TO TRY TO STOP PEOPLE HEADING FOR EUROPE FINAL DECISION SHOULD COME AT A MEETING NEXT WEEK PART OF THE DEAL INVOLVES RESETTLING MIGRANTS THOSE ARRIVING IN GREECE WILL BE RETURNED TO TURKEY BUT FRIDGE PERSON RETURNED THE E.U. WILL TAKE SOMEONE FROM ONE OF TURKEY'S REFUGEE CAMPS THAT SHOULD REMOVE THE INCENTIVE TO MAKE THE CROSSING TO GREECE
YOU WILL ALSO SPEED UP PLANS TO ALLOW TURKISH PEOPLE TO MOVE FREELY IN EUROPE WITHOUT VISAS AND ITS PROMISE TO PAY AT LEAST THREE BILLION EUROS HUNGRY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S REFUSING TO TAKE ANY MORE REFUGEES AND A LITTLE EARLIER I SPOKE TO ZOLTAN AND CO VIRTUES PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR AUBURN SPOKESMAN I ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF TURKEY'S DEMANDS IN NEW PROPOSALS
YEAH THAT WOULD BE DOING THAT WOMAN BETWEEN TURKEY AND YOU DIRECTLY ON HER BABIES WHICH IS CLEAR BUT THAT WOULD BE QUITE ADEQUATE REGAN ACTUALLY BE PURE THAT WE'VE GOT TO GO IS THIS JUST IS THIS BECAUSE HUNGRY DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY MORE PEOPLE
BETTER IDEA BECAUSE THAT WOULD INVITE MORE PEOPLE TO COME EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU'RE ACTUALLY READING THE KIND OF PROBLEM BUT ALSO WRITE IN AGAIN I'M GOING IN THERE DO YOU NOT RECOGNISE THAT THERE IS THIS CRISIS HERE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE SLING IN MANY CASES SLING WALLS AND THEY NEED HELP
BUT ALSO DO EUROPEAN UNION AIRCREWS AT YOUR REAL SO WILL YOU ABSOLUTELY VETO ANY IDEA OF TAKING ANY MORE MIGRANTS OR REFUGEE
THE FIGURES FOR LAST YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN HUNGRY GRANTED ASYLUM TO FIVE HUNDRED EIGHT PEOPLE IS THAT IT GET THE CORRECT NUMBER
HEY IN HUNGARY WE EXPERIAN REPORT I'LL BE ILLEGAL MIGRANTS CROSS THE COUNTRY YOU TALKED ABOUT VETOING THIS DEAL EATS OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES SAY LOOK WE WANT TO SIGN UP TO THIS WE'LL TAKE THESE PEOPLE WE WON'T HAVE AN EXPECTATION ON HUNGRY TO DO SO CAN YOU STILL VETO IT AGAIN I ABLE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY DURING THE NIGHT A VERY OBVIOUS WE ARE NOT AGAIN I'M NOT
I KNOW MANTRA REGARDING THE TURKEY THERE BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS WIGGLY BETTER NOT ONLY HUNGRY BUT ALL
IF YOU EVER GET BUT LACE THEIR FUTURE AND WILL DEFINITELY EDWARD IT WAS GLOWED AT YOUR REAL SOLUTION SO TANK OVER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WELL WE JOINED BY EUROPE EDITOR CATCHER ADLER CATCHER OH THE HUNGER IS GOING TO PUT A SPANNER IN THE WORKS
IT'S REALLY NOT JUST ABOUT THE HUNGARIANS YOU'VE GOT TWENTY EIGHT E.U. MEMBER STATES THEY HAVE HELD SO MANY EMERGENCY MIGRATIONS SUMMITS TO DATE SOME HAD RESULTED IN AGREEMENT OTHERS NOT EVEN WHEN THERE ARE AGREEMENTS THEY STILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED
THE KIND OF THE OUTLINES THAT WE HAVE FOR AN AGREEMENT TO ME WE HAD DAVID CAMERON LEAVING THE MEETING IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING SAYING THERE IS A BASIS FOR A BREAKTHROUGH BUT IT'S A COMPLICATED ONE IT'S FRAUGHT WITH LEGAL AND LOGISTICAL COMPLICATIONS AND THEN OF COURSE AS WE SAY THERE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT WHAT DOES THAT YOU WANT THE E.U. WANTS TO STOP
MIGRANTS REFUGEES EVERYBODY TRYING TO COME TO EUROPE TO GET A BETTER LIFE OR JUST WANT TO PUT PEOPLE OFF THAT BAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE IT WANTS TO SEND ALL ECONOMIC MIGRANT BACK TO THEIR HOMES AND IDEALLY IT WANTS TO LOOK AFTER REFUGEES MUCH CLOSER TO THEIRS BUT WE'VE ALREADY HEARD WARNINGS FROM THE UNITED NATIONS AND THAT THIS COULD BREAK INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW WITH SOME ASYLUM SEEKERS ACTUALLY NEEDING THEIR CLAIMS TO BE HEARD HERE IN EUROPE NOW YOU MENTIONED
EARLIER SERI THIS THIS IDEA THAT ANY MIGRANT SENT BACK TO TURKEY IN THE OUTLINE OF THIS DEAL WOULD THEN BE REPLACED WITH SOMEONE BEING SENT FROM TURKEY BACK TO THAT HE ACTUALLY IN THE OUTLINE OF THE DEAL THIS REFERS TO SYRIAN SO WHAT WHAT TURKEYS IS SAYING IT'S ALREADY LOOKING AFTER THE OFFICIAL FIGURE TWO AND A HALF MILLION SYRIANS IN TURKEY IT'S ACTUALLY THOUGHT TO BE A LOT MORE THAN THAT ACTUALLY ON ON THE GROUND
SO WHAT TURKEY SAYING IS THERE ANY SYRIAN REFUGEE MIGRANT WHO'S SENT BACK FROM THE E.U. WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED BY A SYRIAN REFUGEE ALREADY IN TURKEY BUT JUST JUST BRIEFLY THERE SORRY JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFICULTIES ON THE GROUND
WE'VE HEARD THEY'RE HUNGRY DOESN'T AGREE SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS A COALITION OF THE WILLING LED BY GERMANY BUT ACTUALLY THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTRIES THAT ARE VERY UNWILLING AND THEN ARRIVING MIGRANTS IF YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SUCH A BIG JOURNEY THEY HAVE TO AGREE TO GET TO GO BACK
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE UGLY SCENES SYRIANS IRAQIS AFGHANS WHO SAY THEY FLED FOR THEIR LIVES WHO HAVE MADE THIS JOURNEY OVER THE SEA TO GREECE WANTING TO GET TO THE GREATER EUROPE ARE THEY JUST GOING TO CALMLY WALK BACK OVER TO TURKEY WHERE THEY AGREED TO GO THIS THIS COULD GET VERY MESSY INDEED AND JUST BRIDGES VERY BRIEFLY CATCHER GERMANY NEEDS A DEAL DOESN'T IT FOR POLITICAL REASONS GERMANY PUSHED SO HARD FOR THIS MEETING WITH TURKEY PRIVATELY MANY DIPLOMATS HAVE SAID
THAT THE E.U. AND TURKEY WILL NOT READY FOR THIS DEAL AND AS WE SAW THE TOUCH PRIME MINISTER SUDDENLY TURNED UP WITH A WHOLE LOAD MORE FUNDING AND POLITICAL DEMANDS I'M GLYNN MERKEL FACES THREE KEY REGIONAL ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY A WHOLE POLITICAL FUTURE HANGS IN THE BALANCE OVER THIS MIGRATION CRISIS BUT THE E. U. TWO NOTES THAT ITS CREDIBILITY THAT THE UNITY OF EUROPE AND THE FUTURE OF GREECE WHERE ALL THOSE MIGRANTS CURRENTLY ARE STUCK AT THE MOMENT ARE IN DANGER HERE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THIS DESPERATION TO GET SOME DEAL DONE
KATYA ADLER THANK YOU SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN OUR POLICE FORCES IN ENGLAND AND WALES RESORTING TO THE USE OF FORCE TOO OFTEN AND TOO QUICKLY THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION SAYS THAT OF ITS TWO HUNDRED INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE USE OF FORCE OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD IT HAD CONCERNS ABOUT A THIRD OF THE CASES
THE IVC CHAIR DAME ANNE OWERS IS WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING MORNING WHAT SORTS OF CONCERNS DID YOU HAVE WELL WE HAD CONCERNS IN PARTICULAR ABOUT WHEN FORCES USED ON PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS FOR EXAMPLE THEY WERE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN OTHERS
TO TO DIE AFTER FORCE HAD BEEN USED IN A MORE LIKELY SUBSEQUENTLY TO DIE OF COURSE THOSE PEOPLE CAN BE CHALLENGING AS WELL AS VULNERABLE AND THEIR ISSUES FOR THE POLICE IN HOW YOU COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BUT THEY'RE ALSO ISSUES FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE SERVICES THAT CAN PREVENT PEOPLE GETTING INTO CRISIS OR SUPPORT THEM THROUGH THAT AND THERE WAS ALSO A DISPROPORTIONATE USE OF FORCE AGAINST THOSE FROM A BLACK OR MINORITY ETHNIC BACKGROUND WE DIDN'T FIND OUT NO BUT WE DID FIND WAS THAT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE HUGH HAD HAD FORCE USED ON THEM
THEY WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE LIKELY TO BE FROM THE EMMY COMMUNITIES WHAT DOES THIS SUGGEST YOU I'M WONDERING WHETHER YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE THAT THE POLICE ARE USING FORCE MORE THAN THEY SHOULD YOU CAN'T SAY THAT AND YOU CAN'T SAY THAT PRECISELY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE STATISTICS ONE OF THEIR KEY FINDINGS IN THE REPORT IN THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT WE NEED THE POLICE TO KEEP CONSISTENT STATISTICS ABOUT WHEN WHERE
WHY THEY USE FORCE FOR THOSE TO BE AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS WITH COMMUNITIES AND ALSO TIP TO ALERT PEOPLE WHERE THERE ARE AREAS OF CONCERN WHAT WE HAVE IS VERY PATCHY INFORMATION AT THE MOMENT OUR OWN INVESTIGATIONS REMEMBER ARE INTO THE MOST SERIOUS INCIDENTS THE ONES THAT COME TO US SO THEY ARE NOT TYPICAL OF THE WAY FORCES USED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
AND I'M GENERALLY SO THERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT INTO THE ACTION JUST NOW AND THAT MEANS THAT IS THEN A REQUIREMENT FOR THE POLICE IN THERE THE KEY FRAMEWORK IS THAT FOURTH SHOULD BE NECESSARY REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONED THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR THE FOR THE POLICE TO LOG WHEN THEY ARE USING RESTRAINTS OR ALL OR OTHER FORMS OF PRECISELY THERE'S NO CONSISTENT RECORDING ACROSS POLICE HORSES AND THAT IS WHY THAT'S A KEY RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE OF COURSE THE PUBLIC EXCEPT THE POLICE
WE NEED TO USE FORCE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S ACCEPTED ALTHOUGH WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS LESS CONFIDENCE AMONG THE EMMY COMMUNITIES AND YOUNG PEOPLE BUT BY AND LARGE THAT'S ACCEPTED BUT WHAT THERE ISN'T AT THE MOMENT IS HE'S A CLEAR
PICTURE OF WHEN WHERE WHY FORCES USED AND SO THAT CONSISTENT RECORDING IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND AS I SAY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR TWO REASONS SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE THERE ARE CONCERNS AND ALSO SO THAT THAT CAN BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENTS THAT THAT COME TO YOU DO YOU DO YOU FIND THE POLICE
DEFENSIVE ABOUT THE THE USE OF FORCE WHEN WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CASES WHAT'S THE ATTITUDE LIKE ART IT VARIES AND SOMETIMES THERE IS DEFENSIVENESS AND I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE PICK UP IN THE REPORT IS THAT WHEN THE PUBLIC COMPLAIN TO THE POLICE ABOUT USE OF FORCE THE POLICE ARE LESS LIKELY TO UPHOLD THOSE KINDS OF COMPLAINTS THAN OTHER SORTS OF COMPLAINTS
BUT WHEN THOSE PEOPLE APPEALED TO US WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO UPHOLD THEIR APPEAL WHICH SAID THEY HAD A DECENT SO SO IT SUGGESTS THAT THE POLICE AREN'T ALWAYS THEMSELVES ALERT TO END THERE THERE OUGHT TO BE CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY FORCES BEEN USED DAME ANNE OWERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S TWENTY MINUTES OF COMING UP TO TWENTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN LET'S GET SOME BUSINESS NEWS JO LINE UM HE'S BACK WITH US WITH DETAILS OF THE JOB LOSSES YEAH WE'VE GOT CONFIRMATION THAT THE NUMBER OF JOBS GOING AT EM POWER WILL BE TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AT SLIGHTLY LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND REPORTED AT THE WEEKEND
THE LOSS OF POWER IN THE U.K. HAVE GROWN TO NINETY NINE MILLION POUNDS FOR THE YEAR NO ONE BIG SITE WILL BE CLOSED DOWN AND THE JOB LOSSES WILL BE SPREAD ACROSS ALL EXISTING SITES AND PROCESS IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING HOW THE COMPANY OPERATES AND ADMITS IT WILL BE A HUGE TASK
LET'S TURN TO ONE OPINION FROM A WELL KNOWN BUSINESS ON THE E.U. REFERENDUM JOB MASON IS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT TATE AND LYLE SUGARS WHICH YOU MUST STRESS GERALD IS DISTINCT FROM TATE AND LYLE P.L.C. WHICH IS A DIFFERENT THE BUSINESS YOU ARE SPUN OUT OF IT CORRECT YES WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AT THE MOMENT WE DON'T FEEL GREAT EUROPEAN POLICY IS THE BIGGEST DRAG ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR SUGAR REFINERIES IN THE U.K.
AND IT'S THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THAT EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY JOBS AND OUR REFINERY IN EAST LONDON AT THE MOMENT MEL LET'S WALK THROUGH WHY THAT IS THE CASE YOU MOSTLY IMPORT SUGAR CANE AS OPPOSED TO BEAT CORRECT WE MAKE SUGAR FROM KANE AND EUROPEAN POLICIES RESTRICT WHO WE CAN BUY THAT FROM AN CHARGERS TARIFFS
WHEREAS EUROPEAN BEAT SUGAR PRODUCTION WHICH IS MOST OF THE SUGAR PRODUCTION IN EUROPE IS DE REGULATED AND ACTUALLY SUBSIDISED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY WELL OF COURSE THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD PROTECT ITS OWN FARMERS RATHER THAN FARMERS IN THE CARIBBEAN FOR EXAMPLE I'VE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT ARGUMENT BUT WE'VE BEEN REFINING CANE SUGAR IN LONDON FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS JUST BECAUSE THE U.K. CHOOSES TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY WHY SHOULD THE EUROPEAN UNION FORCES TO CHANGE
YOU'D YOU'D YOU DO PROBABLY ADMIT THAT THE FINAL PRODUCT DO BEEF AND KANE THE TASTE IS ALMOST NEGLIGIBLE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE YEAH THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE JOE THAT THE END PRODUCT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS A SINGLE MARKET IN SUGAR IN EUROPE
THE EUROPEAN REGULATORS TREAT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRODUCER IN EUROPE VERY DIFFERENTLY WHICH OBVIOUSLY MAKES IT REALLY TOUGH FOR US TO COMPETE WHY DON'T YOU SWITCH TO BEAT IT IS POSSIBLE THE PRODUCERS WERE THERE I'M NOT SURE WHY WE SHOULD AND WE'VE BEEN PRODUCING SUGAR IN OUR WAY FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS IF YOU GO OUTSIDE OF EUROPE ALMOST ALL THE SUGAR IS PRODUCED IN CANE REFINERIES LIKE OURS WHY SHOULD WE BE FORCED INTO A MOULD THAT EUROPE WANTS US TO BE FORCED IN O.K. YOU HAVE
YOU HAVE BEEN NUDGING THE GOVERNMENT AS PART OF THE NEGOTIATION BEFORE THE BRUSSELS AGREEMENT LAST MONTH WE NOW KNOW WHAT THE CAT WHAT DAVID CAMERON THE PRIME MINISTER BROUGHT BACK WILL YOU NOW IN LIGHT OF THAT CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE OH WE'RE NOT JUST THERE YET I MEAN HORSE TRADING IS STILL GOING IN BRUSSELS I SUSPECT IT WILL GO ON RIGHT UP TO THE DAY OF THE POLES WE'RE STILL PUSHING FOR MORE REFORMING EUROPE BUT IF WE CAN'T GET THAT I'M ABSOLUTELY CLEAR
THAT THE FUTURE OF OUR WORKFORCE WOULD BE MORE SECURE OUTSIDE OF EUROPE I WOULD YOU CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE IF WE GET TO THAT POINT AS WE GET CLOSER OH K. MASON DEAD SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT TATE AND LYLE SUGAR THANKS FOR JOINING US
JOE THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN WOMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA ARE RESTRICTED IN WHAT THEY CAN WEAR THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DRIVE AND THEY CAN'T TRAVEL WITHOUT A CHAPERONE BUT SAUDI WOMEN ARE INCREASINGLY USING SOCIAL MEDIA
TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD SOMETIMES IS TO CHALLENGE THEIR OWN SOCIETY BUT ALSO THE WAY THAT THE OUTSIDE WORLD STEREOTYPES THEM
MY KNOW MAHON HAS BEEN TALKING TO SAUDI WOMEN IS PART OF A B.B.C. SERIES CALLED SAUDIS ON SOCIAL FAITH FREEDOM AND FUN
WHEN IT COMES TO SAUDI WOMEN WELL MOST OF THE WORLD HAS A CERTAIN IMAGE UNEQUAL OPPRESSED SUPPRESSED AND THEY AREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO DRIVE
BUT MANY SAUDI WOMEN SAY THAT'S JUST A STEREOTYPE THAT'S NOT THE FULL PICTURE INCLUDING JOURNALIST SUMMAT OWN WOULD AGAIN
I SUPPOSE I DON'T TEMPT THE SAUDI WOMAN IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT I'M ONE OF THESE WOMEN WHO DON'T FIT THE IMAGE PORTRAYED BY WESTERN MEDIA ENAMOURED OF ME SO WE'VE BEEN ASKING SAUDI WOMEN WHETHER THEY REALLY ARE THAT OPPRESSED
NOT AS SHY BEN IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A TRAINING COMPANY AS A SET OR DO YOU WANT ME I NEVER FELT O.K.
WE HAVE AND I WANT A PET NO MAN MORE EXAM FINICKY WOMEN NORA HE'S REFERRING TO THE RECENT A LONG AWAITED MOVE TO ALLOW WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND TAKE PART IN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS
I'M JUST LOOKING AT SOME FIGURES AND IT'S NOT JUST IN PARLIAMENT THAT WOMEN ARE BEGINNING TO BE MORE REPRESENTED MORE WOMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA GRADUATE FROM UNIVERSITY THEN MEN AND CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF WOMEN IN THE KINGDOM CAN WORK AND IN FACT HER FOUND PROMINENCE IN DIFFERENT FIELDS
THEY'RE A PROMINENT FEMALE FILM MAKERS SAUDI GOT ITS FIRST FEMALE LAWYER IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN AND THE FIRST WOMAN IN THE GULF REGION TO GET THEIR P. H. T. IN BY TECHNOLOGY IS SOUND E.
AND WHEN IT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA WELL LET'S JUST SAY THEY'RE NOT KEEPING IT QUITE HASHTAG TWENTY SAY THE TOBY DRIVING HAS TED WOMAN ATTACKED HARASSED MAM HAS TAKE PARLIAMENT WITHOUT SEATS HASHTAG GO CONFRONTS RELIGIOUS POLICE ALL OF THESE HAS STAGS HAVE GONE VIRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND IT'S ALL WOMEN WHO ARE DOMINATING THE DISCUSSION
SO WOMEN CAN DO MANY THINGS IN SAUDI AND THEY DO BUT WERE OFTEN LIMITS SEND IS THE FACT THAT THEY NEED THE MALE GUARDIAN AND FOR WOMEN LIKE THIS STUDENT NO IT'S ALL A BIT DRACONIAN
IN THIS MATTER SOME OF THE THINGS WE DON'T LIKE TO SEE CHANGE INCLUDE AND MEND IN SOME OF THE LAWS LIKE ALLOWING WOMEN TO OBTAIN THE NATIONAL I.D. CARD WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A MALE GUARDIAN WEDI SOCIAL RESEARCHER HAMSTER EDSIN LUCY SAYS WOMEN ALSO HAVE DIFFICULTIES BEHIND BARS
WITH A MACHETE IT WAS YOU HAD WOMEN CAN'T BE RELEASED WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF A MALE GUARDIAN WHICH IS A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE MANY GUARDIANS REFUSED TO LET THEM RETURN THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ONE SUCH STORY IS SHEDS
HER WORDS ARE VOICED BY AN ACTRESS I'M TWENTY YEARS OLD AND I GREW UP WITH A VIOLENT FATHER FIVE YEARS AGO MY MOTHER WENT TO COURT TO ASK FOR A DIVORCE MY MOTHER FOUGHT TO KEEP US WITH HERBERT ON THE MAY GUARDIANSHIP LAW BY FATHER WON CUSTODY ALL MY MOTHER HAD WANTED WAS TO DIVORCE HER ABUSIVE HUSBAND BUT SHE GOT NO JUSTICE WHEN IT COMES TO RIGHTS THERE ARE STILL MANY BATTLES TO FIGHT
HOWEVER MANY WOMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA SAY THAT LABELLING THEM AS VICTIMS ONLY MAKES TIS STRUGGLE FOR EQUAL RIGHTS HARDER TO ACHIEVE
DURING THE SUMMER AND WHAT AGAIN SAYS THE MEDIA NEEDS TO REPORT NOT JUST THE NEGATIVE BUT THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TO SAUDI WOMEN AND JUST COVERED THEM KNOCK I'M NOT AGAINST CRITICISM ON THE CONTRARY I ACCEPT CRITICISM AND SHOWING THESE EXAMPLES BUT IN RETURN WESTERN MEDIA SHOULD BE FAIR AND SHOW THE OTHER SIDE TO SAUDI WOMEN AS WELL AND I'M NOT A DEAR

THE EUROPEAN UNION AND TURKEY HAVE AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO A WIDE RANGING DEAL DECIDE TO STEM THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS ENTERING EUROPE ILLEGALLY E.U. LEADERS SAY TURKEY WILL ACCEPT THE RAPID RETURN OF ALL MIGRANTS CROSSING FROM ITS SHORES TO GREECE BUT FOR EVERY SYRIAN SENT BACK ANOTHER SYRIAN LIVING IN REFUGEE CAMPS IN TURKEY MUST BE RESETTLED IN THE E.U. TURKEYS ATTACH CONDITIONS INCLUDING SPEEDING UP ITS E.U. MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED AT AN E.U. SUMMIT NEXT WEEK
THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF PRISONS PETER CLARKE HAS CRITICISED THE TREATMENT OF MIGRANTS IN KENT'S LAST SUMMER HAS NEW FIGURES SHOW THAT MORE THAN THREE AND A HALF THOUSAND WERE DETAINED AFTER CROSSING THE ENGLISH CHANNEL HIDDEN IN LORRIES OR FREIGHT TRAINS OFFICIALS RESORTED TO TEMPORARILY HOLDING MIGRANTS INCLUDING CHILDREN IN A FREIGHT SHED IN FOLKESTONE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION AND FACILITIES HAVE IMPROVED
THE SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NIKE HAS SUSPENDED ITS TIES WITH THE TENNIS CHAMPION MARIA SHARAPOVA AFTER SHE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE'D FAILED A DRUGS TEST OF THE RECENT AUSTRALIAN OPEN SHARAPOVA WHO'S TWENTY EIGHT AND FROM RUSSIA IS FACING A LENGTHY BAN AFTER TESTING POSITIVE FOR A DRUG USED TO TREAT BLOOD FLOW RESTRICTION SHE SAID SHE'D BEEN TAKING IT LEGALLY FOR TEN YEARS BUT FAILED TO NOTICE IT HAD BEEN PUT ON A LIST OF BANNED SUBSTANCES FROM JANUARY
THE ENERGY FIRMER EM POWER HAS CONFIRMED THAT IT'S TO CUT TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED JOBS AFTER REPORTING LOSSES OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS FOR LAST YEAR THE JOB LOSSES REPRESENT ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE WORKFORCE THE COMPANY'S LOST LARGE NUMBERS OF CUSTOMERS AFTER PROBLEMS WITH BILLING AND PEOPLE CHANGING TO CHEAPER ENERGY FIRMS
SENIOR OFFICIALS WORKING WITH THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON HAVE BEEN TOLD NOT TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST HIS POSITION CALLING FOR BRITAIN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AN EMAIL FROM THE MAYOR'S CHIEF OF STAFF WHICH HAS BEEN SEEN BY THE B. B. C. SAYS THEY SHOULD EITHER BACK HIS POSITION OR AVOID OPPOSING IT IN PUBLIC
MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN ENGLAND SAY THEY'VE SEEN NO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES FOR CHILDREN DESPITE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM LAST SUMMER MINISTERS SAID THEY'D INVEST AN EXTRA ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS IN THIS FINANCIAL YEAR HEALTH TRUSTS SAY SOME SERVICES ARE STILL BEING CUT
THE TIME IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS AKIN TO THE BATTLE OF THE SUFFRAGETTES THAT'S WHAT THE EMPLOYMENT MINISTER PRETTY PATEL WILL ARGUE TODAY SAYING THAT THE SUFFRAGETTES DIDN'T FIGHT FOR THEIR VOTE IN ORDER FOR DEMOCRACY TO BE SURRENDERED TO THE Y. YOU SHE'LL BE AT THE LAUNCH OF THE CAMPAIGN GROUP WOMEN FOR BRITAIN THE EQUIVALENT GROUP ON THE REMAIN SIDE IS CALLED WOMEN IN
BOTH ARE TRYING TO TARGET WOMEN VOTERS AMID EVIDENCE THAT MANY UNDECIDED VOTERS ARE WOMEN BUT WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. AND ENERGY MINISTER ANDREA LEAD SOME HE'S PART OF THE LEAF CAMPAIGN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHY SHOULD WOMEN VOTE TO LEAVE
WELL ESSENTIALLY FOR WINNING AT THE THE EVIDENCE IS THAT THEY'RE NOT AS ENGAGED WITH THE SUBJECT BUT WHAT THEY REALLY DO CARE ABOUT IS ISSUES LIKE THE COST OF LIVING LIKE HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE PAYING OVER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK THAT WOULD PAY FOR A NEW HOSPITAL EVERY WEEK THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF ISSUES THAT ALTHOUGH WE DON'T WANT TO GENERALISE NO TWO WOMEN ARE THE SAME BUT WOMEN ARE VERY INTERESTED IN ISSUES AROUND COST OF LIVING AND VALUE FOR MONEY
AND ALSO OF COURSE THE FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN LIKE HER HOW COULD THEIR FUTURE PROSPECTS AS WOMEN BE BETTER OFF OUTSIDE THE E.U. I THINK FOR ALL WORKERS THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WITHIN THE E.U. IS THAT WE HAVE SIXTY PER CENT OF U.K. PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN S.M.E.S SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES AND THOSE BUSINESSES VERY FEW OF THEM AROUND TWENTY PER CENT OF THEM EXPORT TO THE E.U. BUT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF THEM
HAVE TO ACTUALLY ABIDE BY ALL THE REGULATIONS WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE IT DETERS JOB OFFERS FROM BEING MADE SO ACTUALLY A LIFE OUTSIDE OF THE E.U. FOR MANY PEOPLE AND OF COURSE WOMEN IS HE'S MUCH BETTER BUT THEN IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE MADE A REAL DIFFERENCE TO WOMEN'S LIVES IN THIS COUNTRY EQUAL PAY FOR EXAMPLE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NOT BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN THE WORKPLACE ARE EQUALITY ACT IN TWENTY TEN
WAS BASED ON ON THE REGULATIONS AND THE DIRECTORS OF THE EWE HAD ALREADY PUT IN TRAIN OVER MANY YEARS BUT THAT'S A RIDICULOUS ARGUMENT SO TO SAY THAT THE U.K. WOULD BE INCAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING ITS OWN SOVEREIGN THAT'S LOVE GOING TO TELL YOU NOT A LOT IT'S NOT THE POINT I MADE I GAVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF A OF A PARTICULAR ACTON AND SAY THAT IT WAS BASED ON WHAT HE'D ALREADY BEEN PUT IN IN INTO THE E.U. PRINCIPLES IN FACT
GENDER EQUALITY AND EQUAL PAY FOR MEN AND WOMEN WAS IN THE FOUNDING TREATY OF THE YEAR IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN BUT THE U.K. HAS A VERY GOOD RECORD WE HAVE UNILATERALLY INTRODUCED SHARED PARENTAL LEAVE FOR EXAMPLE THE U.K. COULD PERFECTLY WELL IMPLICATE ITS OWN LAW INTRODUCED ITS OWN LAWS THAT PROVIDE ABSOLUTE EQUALITY AND OF COURSE WOULD DO AND I SHOULD ALSO ADD THAT ALL OF THESE RULES THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED WHETHER BY THE E.U.
OR BY THE U.K. UNILATERALLY WOULD REMAIN A PART OF U.K. LAW UNLESS AND UNTIL WE DECIDED TO REVOKE THEM SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE THAT THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN OR EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE U.K. IS DOING MUCH MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD TO TRY AND ENSURE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN AND WE HAVE MANAGED TO DO MAKE PUT THOSE MEASURES THROUGH IN THE U.K. DESPITE WHAT YOUR CABINET COLLEAGUE PRETTY PATEL REFERS TO
AS THE SURRENDER OF DEMOCRACY TO THE E.U. WELL WHAT PRETTY IS TALKING ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE MADE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SO WHICHEVER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT WHETHER YOU LIKE THOSE LAWS OR NOT THEY ARE MADE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THEY ARE NOT A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT SO SO HAVE YES WE HAVE SURRENDERED OUR SOVEREIGNTY TO THE EUROPEAN UNION
IT'LL BE ARE YOU HAMPERED BY BY THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF THEM ARE VERY PROMINENT VOICES ON THERE ON THERE LEAVE SITE ON MEN
WELL CERTAINLY I THINK THE POINT ABOUT LAUNCHING WOMEN FOR BRITAIN TODAY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT WOMEN ARE OFTEN INTERESTED IN HEARING ALL VIEWS ARE NOT JUST THE VIEWS OF MEN SEE AS I THINK IT HAS BEEN QUITE MALE DOMINATED SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT EVERYBODY GETS TO HEAR FEMALE VERSIONS AND FEMALE VIEWS OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT THE BOG ALTHOUGH THE MOST TO MOST PROMINENT WOMEN IN BRITISH POLITICS THERESA MAY NICOLA STURGEON ARE BOTH ON THE OTHER SIDE
YEAH WELL OBVIOUSLY THE PRIME MINISTER HAS ALLOWED VERY I THINK MAGNANIMOUSLY IS ALLOWED ALL MINISTERS TO CHOOSE THE SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT HE'S ENCOURAGED US TO GO FOR IT WITH ALL OUR HEART AND TO NOT
ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE SWAYED BY INDIVIDUAL AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND SO THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING WHICH IS QUITE RIGHT BUT NEVERTHELESS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S GREAT THAT PEOPLE LIKE PRETTY PATEL AND PENNY MORDANT ARE ACTUALLY CAMPAIGNING AS HARD AS THEY CAN FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT E.D.F. BECAUSE OF YOUR YOUR ROLLERS AS ENERGY MINISTER GIVEN THE CONCERNS THAT WE'RE NOW HEARING EXPRESSED WITHIN E.D.F. ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE OF THE NEW HINKLEY POINT PROJECT
COULD THE GOVERNMENT TO GO ANY FURTHER TOWARDS INCENTIVISING THEM TO BUILD THIS PLANT NO WE E.D.F. THEY SAID BACK IN NOVEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER TIME
THAT THEY WOULD WITHIN SOME MONTHS MAKE THEIR FINAL PAPERS SIGNED AND SEALED AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WAITING FOR AND SO THE DEAL IS STRUCK AND AS FAR AS THE U.K. IS CONCERNED WE'RE JUST WAITING TO HEAR FOR THE FINAL DECISION SO THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD AND FINALISED THE U.K. GOVERNMENT'S PAPER WORD IF THAT FINAL DECISION IS NOT THERE DOES NOT GO IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT IT TO GO HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE ENERGY STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE PUT IN PLACE WHICH RELIES ON ON THIS PLANT BEING BUILT

MALE IDENTIFIES THE AID AS DANIEL KAUTSKY AND DESCRIBING HIM AS DAVID CAMERON'S SHADOW WE HIT MAN SAYS HE MADE IT CLEAR TO MISTER LONGWORTH THAT HE WAS ACTING WITH THE FULL AUTHORITY OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE WRANGLING BETWEEN E.U. LEADERS IN TURKEY OVER HOW TO STEM THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS INTO EUROPE PROMPTS MUCH COMMENT WRITING IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE FORMER FOREIGN SECRETARY WILLIAM HAGUE SAYS EUROPEAN LEADERS NEED TO HAVE THE VISION TO FASHION A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE TIES WITH TURKEY
IT IS NEEDED HE WRITES BECAUSE OF ANGKOR IS INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN DIRECTION AND THAT MEANS IT CANNOT BE A FULL MEMBER OF THE E.U. BUT HE SAYS THE ABSENCE OF ANY CO OPERATION WITH THE TURKS WOULD SPELL DISASTER FOR EUROPE THE SOLUTION HE SUGGESTS IS A TWO TIER EUROPE A KIND OF ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP THAT HE BELIEVES WOULD SUIT BRITAIN TO THE INDEPENDENT DESCRIBES WHAT IT CALLS A GROWING SENSE OF DREAD THAT ANY DEAL TO RETURN MIGRANTS TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES COULD TRIGGER VIOLENCE IN REFUGEE CAMPS

USING PUBLIC MONEY THEN MARVEL AT AN OFFICIAL EFFECTIVELY RULING OUT THE LAST CHANCE TO PUT IN THE DOCK THE PRIME SUSPECT AT ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST APPALLING TERROR ATTACKS

BERRY GORDY WAS THE MAN WHO BUILT THE CAREERS OF SINGERS LIKE DIANA ROSS SMOKEY ROBINSON OR MARVIN GAYE HE FOUNDED MOTOWN AND HE TURNED IT INTO ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL RECORD LABELS IN HISTORY PRODUCING MUSIC THAT APPEALED TO BOTH BLACK AND WHITE AUDIENCES NOW AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY SIX HE'S WRITTEN A MUSICAL ABOUT HIS LIFE CALLED MOTOWN IT OPENS IN LONDON TONIGHT AND HE'S BEEN TALKING TO OUR ARTS CORRESPONDENT REBECCA JETS
IT WAS THE PERFECT POP FORMULA UPBEAT UPLIFTING AND DOCTOR
AND IT WAS BERRY GORDY WHO CREATED THE SOUND OF YOUNG
WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD AND THERE WAS THIS BIG HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION FIGHT BETWEEN JOHN LEWIS
FROM AMERICA MAX SMELLING FROM GERMANY AND JOHN LEWIS WAS BLACK LIKE ME AND MY FAMILY AND JOE LOUIS
AND I SO MY MOTHER AND FATHER CRY AND I
DEEP INSIDE TO DO SOMETHING IN MY LIFE THAT WOULD MAKE MY MOTHER AND FATHER QUIET
MOTOWN TURNED OUT TO BE KIND OF VERY CLEAR THEY'VE GOT THE GOALS REALLY
WAS IT UNREACHABLE WAS IT UNREACHABLE BECAUSE YOU WERE A BLACK MAN WELL YES BECAUSE I WAS BLACK
A BLACK MAN PLUS BLACK MUSIC I WOULD AND THEY GO TO THE WAKE
THIS JACK IS TO PLAY MY MUSIC AND THEY NEVER WOULD BECAUSE IN FEEL THE WAY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THIS MUSIC BECAUSE MOST BLACK MUSIC WAS EITHER REALLY GARTH PULL OR READY BLUES
AND MY LOUISE NOW GOODBYE
BERRY GORDY MADE STARS OF SINGERS LIKE MARVIN GAYE IN BOTH BLACK AND WHITE HOMES BUT HE EXERCISED TOTAL CONTROL OVER EVERY ASPECT OF HIS ARTIST CAREERS AND MARVIN GAYE EVEN LIKE MOTOWN TO THE GESTAPO
YOU WERE A HARD TASK MASTER WEREN'T YOU YOU WERE PRETTY RUTHLESS THAT RUTHLESS
THE TRUTH HAD TO TRUTH TO UNTIL HE WAS FOUR AND WHEN SOMEONE'S DEATH IS FIVE I HAD TO BE A TOUGH TEST METHOD THING
WHY DID YOU WANT TO MAKE DIANA ROSS A BIG INTERNATIONAL SADOR
THERE WAS ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT PERFORMERS I'VE EVER SEEN AND I FELT THAT IF SHE LISTENED TO ME I WOULD GUIDE HER IN THE RIGHT WAY WHICH UNION AIR HAS MORE
FOR A CAREER IN THAT
DIANA ROSS LEFT MOTOWN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE OTHER STARS ALSO TURN THEIR BACKS ON BERRY GORDY WHO EVENTUALLY SOLD THE COMPANY YOU KNOW I HEAR THE MALL WHEN THEY LEFT ME FOR MORE MONEY
WHAT CONTROL BIGGER COMPANIES I WAS VERY UPSET BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT I REALISED THAT THEY HAD REALLY MADE ME WELL
THE STORY IS COMING TO THE STAGE IN A MUSICAL CREATED BY VERY
BY WRITING THE SHOW YOURSELF HOW CONFIDENT CAN AUDIENCES BE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE WHOLE TRUTH WARTS AND ALL
IF YOU TELL THE TRUTH AND MAKE IT IN ATTAINING YOU'LL HAVE HER HERE IF THE TRUTH ISN'T THAT AN ENTERTAINING WAY THEN JUST BECOMES A DOCUMENTARY YOU'VE GOT TWO AND A HALF HOURS COURSE THERE WERE MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED YOU KNOW THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN FIVE DAYS TO TELL THEIR STORY
BACK IN THOSE MOTOWN DAYS WHERE YOU EVER ATTEMPTED TO GET BEHIND THE MICROPHONE AND SING ANY OF THESE SOCKS YES I WAS ABOUT MY VOICE THERE WAS A MIXTURE BETWEEN FRANK SINATRA PERRY CORNWALL AND THAT I'M NOT DARK
AND UNFORTUNATELY I THUMB WAR LIKE THAT DUCKED AND I DID THE OTHER TWO BUT WHEN I WROTE THE SONG FOR
TWO TO I DID THING DO YOU LOVE ME AND THEY CAN'T BE MY VOICE GOES WITH THE GARDAI OR ITALY
I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT THE THING AT ALL IT'S NOT BAD THOUGH VERY GAUDY THEY'RE TALKING TO REBECCA JO THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER AND A STUDIO THIS MORNING LORD AND GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MICHELLE
THE NEWS THAT ROYAL NAVY VESSELS HAD TO BE SENT TO THE A.G.M. TO CURB THE ACTIVITIES OF PEOPLE SMUGGLERS HAS MUCH TO COMMEND IT BUT FOR SOME IT MASKS THE FACT THAT MANY OF THOSE RISKING THEIR LIVES AND SAVING STRA CLAMOURING TO LEAKY AND OVERCROWDED BOATS ARE REFUGEES
NOT SO LONG AGO THE WORD REFUGEE HE'S CONJURED UP IMAGES OF INNOCENT MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN FLEEING TERROR
TODAY REFUGEE AGENCY SOMETIMES INTERPRETED AS ALIEN HORDES AND TEAR GAS AND RAZOR WIRE FENCES HAVE BEEN USED TO KEEP WOULD BE REFUGEES INCLUDING YOUNG CHILDREN AT A DISTANCE
THIS MORNING'S DECISION ON A GRID CONTROL SHE GOES TO THE HEART OF THE MORAL DILEMMA OF DECIDING WHETHER REFUGEE APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE FLEEING CONFLICT WHETHER IT CAN ALSO ENCOMPASS THOSE SEEKING A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN
I'M GOING VIOLENCE IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ ABUSES AND AIRY TRAIL AS WELL AS POVERTY AND KOSSER AND LEADING PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR NEW LIVES ELSEWHERE AND NOT JUST IN EUROPE
AS I SEE IT AS A SIKH I APPLAUD THE INITIAL WELCOME GIVEN TO REFUGEES FLEEING FROM SYRIA IT WAS A WELCOME THAT RESONATED WITH SIKH TEACHINGS THAT EVEN IN THE HEIGHT OF CONFLICT WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET WE'RE ALL MEMBERS OF THE SAME ONE HUMAN RACE AND THEIR HIGHEST RELIGIOUS DUTY IS TO LOOK TO THE NEEDS OF OTHERS
THE CRISIS IN SYRIA IS LINKED IN THE WIDER TURMOIL IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOLLOWING THE SECOND GULF WAR THE PRO DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATIONS CRACKDOWN ON IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN WERE FOLLOWED BY THE EMERGENCE OF ISIS WITH THIS BRUTALITIES AND BEHEADINGS AND THE HORROR AND BOMBS RAINING DOWN ON THE LONG SUFFERING PEOPLE ARE SYRIA FROM ALL DIRECTIONS INCLUDING RUSSIA ISIS THE COALITION ALLIES AND PRESIDENT AS HAND HIMSELF
WHO WOULD NOT WISH TO LEAVE THE INEVITABLE EXIT OF REFUGEES HAS BECOME AN ALMOST UNSTOPPABLE TASH
THE PROBLEM NOW IN DEALING WITH SUCH LARGE NUMBERS IS IMMENSE THE CURRAN TENTATIVE CEASEFIRE IN SERIOUS PERHAPS THE BEST HOPE FOR THE FUTURE BUT THEY'RE VERY REAL DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATING THIS TO PEACE AND STABILITY
SIKHS AREN'T ALONE IN EMPHASISING OUR COMMON RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP THOSE FLEEING TERROR AND I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ANY AGREED SYSTEM OF CONTROLS ON THE GROUNDS OF EXPEDIENCY SHOULD NOT REDUCE OUR SENSE OF COMMON HUMANITY OR BLIND US TO THE IMPORTANCE OF VALUES AND IDEALS
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH LORD SAYING THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT WHILE EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS AND TURKEY WERE THRASHING OUT THAT POLITICAL DEAL TO TRY TO STOP THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE THE CROSSING TO EUROPE NATO HAS STEPPED UP ITS ROLE AND WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL THE FRONTLINE IT IS DEPLOYING SHIPS IN THEIR G. AND C. TO HELP GREECE AND TURKEY CONTROL THEIR BORDERS BETTER
I SPOKE TO NATO SECRETARY GENERAL YEN STILTON BERGEN ASKED HIM ABOUT THE PRACTICALITIES AND THE MISSION AND WHAT NATO SHIPS WOULD BE DOING
YOU COLLECT INFORMATION AND WE WILL MONITOR WE WILL DO SO WHALEN SIR WE WILL DO A RECONNAISSANCE SHARE THIS INFORMATION AND BOTH WITH THE TURKISH GREEK GOD AND THE E.U. BORDER AGENCY FROM PECS TO HELP THEM TO COPE WITH THEIR MIGRANT ONLY REFUGEE CRISIS IN THE G. AND C.
WE WILL NOT TURN BACK THE BOLTS WITH THE MIGRANTS ON THE REFUGEES BUT WE WILL HELP THE GORMAN'S OR TURKEY AND GREECE AND FROM LEGS TO DEAL WITH A SITUATION YOU WILL NOT TURN THE BOATS BACK WILL YOU
PERHAPS HELP THEM ON THEIR WAY TO GREECE WE WILL PROVIDE THE INFORMATION WE WERE ALL HELP THE AUTHORITIES IN THE REGION TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION SO WHAT WE WILL DO IS TO ASSIST AND HELP
WHAT WE DECIDE TO DO NEW WEEKEND WAS TO STEP UP OUR EFFORTS SO THERE WOULD BE MORE SHIPS AND I WELCOME COMEDY MUCH DENOUNCED THEM BY U.K. TO SUNBURN THEY WILL SHIP TO THE TO THE AGENCY WE WILL ALSO INCREASE THE AREA OF OPERATION
INTO THE TERRITORIAL WATERS OR TURKEY AND GREECE BUT YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION COS YOU MADE THE POINT THAT THE AIM IS TO COLLECT INFORMATION TO GO AFTER THE SMUGGLERS BUT THE REALITY IS IF YOU HAVE MORE SHIPS IN THE AREA THEY ARE GOING TO INTERCEPT MORE BOATS WHAT DO YOU THEN DO WITH REFUGEES PRESUME THE MIGRANTS PRESUMABLY YOU TAKE THEM ON TO THE NATE WHICHEVER NATO VESSEL AND THEN TAKE THEM INTO EUROPE
IF WE ARE CLOSE TO OR ETHER NATO VESSEL IS CLOSE TO PEOPLE IN DISTRESS AT SEA WE WILL HELP THEM AND THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH IS SOMETHING WE ARE OBLIGED TO ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW AND I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY VESSEL TO HELP PEOPLE IN DISTRESS AT SEA
THEN WHAT WE AGREED THAT WITH TURKEY TO RETURN THOSE PEOPLE BACK TO TURKEY IF THEY ARE COMIN FROM TURKEY BUT THIS HAS TO BE DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND NATIONAL REGULATIONS BUT YOU SAID AT THE OUTSET THAT YOU WOULD NOT TURN THE BOAT
A MEANING THAT WE WILL NOT GO INTO THE NETWORK OF BORDER POLICE AND LOCAL POSTCARDS I'LL REMAIN RESPONSIBILITY I WOULD TASK IS TO HELP THEM DOING THEIR JOB SO YOU IF A NATO VESSEL COMES ACROSS A BOAT THEY WILL INFORM THE TURKISH COAST GUARD AND THE EXPECTATION WILL BE THAT TURKEY
WE'LL PICK UP THE BOAT THOSE IN THE BOAT AND TAKE THEM BACK TO TURKEY YES WHAT WE WILL DO IS IT OF COURSE WE HAVE BUT A MODERN SYSTEMS FOR SURVEILLANCE FOR RECONNAISSANCE FOR A MONTH WHAT IS GOING ON WE WILL SHARE INFORMATION AND ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN THAT ACTUALLY YOU PUT MORE BOATS IN THE WATER THOSE WHO MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO COME BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A DESPERATE SITUATION MIGHT BE THINK THERE'S A GREATER CHANCE THEY'LL BE PICKED UP THERE I'LL BE RESCUED IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS
THEY HAUL OUT THE IS TO ENABLE TURKEY AND GREEK TO GET MORE CONTROL ALONG THE BORDER TO DISCOURAGE ILLEGAL DANGEROUS BORDER CROSSING US TO CUT THE LINES OF THE HUMAN SMUGGLERS AND TO ENCOURAGE MORE
ORGANISED AND LEGAL MIGRATION BUT THIS OF COURSE NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S THE ISSUES WHICH ARE IN WHICH EUROPEAN UNION AND TURKISH DISCUSSING HOW THEY CAN AGREE ON THE FACT THAT NATO'S HAVING TO GET INVOLVED LIKE THIS IS IT BECAUSE TURKEY IS NOT DOING WHAT IT SHOULD DO TO POLICE ITS OWN BORDER AND TO STOP PEOPLE COMING INTO THE
WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THREE YOU NEED TO A IT'S TURKEY AND GREECE AND GERMANY OST LOST HELP THEM DECIDE THAT I WERE AT THE FENCE MINISTERIAL MEETING A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT WE WOULD HELP THEM AND NOW WE'RE IMPLEMENTING IT IS HELP IN TURKEY OF COURSE IS A NATO MEMBER BUT IT'S SUCH AN INTERESTING SITUATION HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE
I'LL BE NEEDING HELP MANY PEOPLE SAY THEY COULD'VE DONE MORTON UNTIL NOW BUT THEY ARE USING THIS IS LEVEL RIDGE BEVERAGE TO HAVE GREATER ACCESS FASTER BUT PERHAPS A VISA
FREE TRAVEL TO GET MORE MONEY OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
APPRECIATE IT IS IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION HERE BUT IS IT TO YOUR JUDGEMENT THAT TURKEY COULD HAVE BEEN DOING MORE UNTIL NOW TURKEY IS ALLY AT THE NATO ALLIES MOFFAT MOST AFFECTED BY THE REFUGEE MIGRANT CRISIS THEY'RE HOSTING MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS AND I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY OBVIOUS THAT WERE YOU SHOULD ASSIST AND HELP THERE ARE
COUNTRIES ARE READY TO HELP THEM WITH FINANCIAL SUPPORT HELPED AND TO IMPROVE THE LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE REFUGEE CAMPS AND THEN NATO IS PART OF THIS BROAD APPROACH BY IT HOPING TO GET MORE CONTROL ALONG THE BORDERS WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE YEN STILTON BAG THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

HE SAID TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO ME IN YOUR PRODUCT SYRIAN VOICES ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR NEXT MONDAY TO FRIDAY
IN THE NEXT HOUR OF THIS PROGRAMME WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE STRAINS IN THE SYSTEM FOR HOUSING ASYLUM SEEKERS HERE AND ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE PARRY WROTE JERUSALEM IS IT THE BEST CHOICE FOR AN ENGLISH ANTHEM AND WILL BE CONSIDERING WHETHER THE TABLOIDS ARE GANGING UP ON PRINCE WILLIAM YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY THE EIGHTH OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING TURKEY HAS AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO TAKE BACK EVERY MIGRANT AND REFUGEE WHO TRIES TO ENTER THE E.U. FROM ITS SHORES B.B.C. NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT BORIS JOHNSON STAFF HAVE BEEN TOLD NOT TO OPEN THE CONTRADICT HIS CALLED FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE FORMER WIMBLEDON CHAMPION MARIA SHARAPOVA IS FACING A LENGTHY BAN AFTER ANNOUNCING THAT SHE FAILED A DRUGS TEST IN JANUARY
AND DOCUMENT SEEN BY THIS PROGRAMME WARNED THAT THE SYSTEM FOR HOUSING ASYLUM SEEKERS IS AT BREAKING POINT THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE E.U. LEADERS ENDED THEIR SUMMIT WITH TURKEY LAST NIGHT BY HOLDING UP THE PROSPECT OF AN END TO SCENES OF MIGRANTS CROSSING THE AEGEAN SEA IN MAKESHIFT BOATS IN A DESPERATE BID TO REACH EUROPE
AFTER TALKS IN BRUSSELS LASTING MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS TURKEY AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO TAKE BACK EVERY ILLEGAL MIGRANT FROM THE GREEK ISLANDS IN RETURN FOR AN E.U. PROMISED TO RESETTLE A SIMILAR NUMBER OF SYRIANS FROM ITS OWN CAMPS BRITAIN WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE SCHEME AS IT'S OUTSIDE THE SHOWING AND PASSPORT FREE AREA THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK SAID THE DEAL WOULD INVOLVE COMPREHENSIVE LARGE SCALE AND FAST TRACK RETURNS OF MIGRANTS FROM GREECE TO TURKEY
THIS OPERATION OR THEM WITHOUT DIRECTLY IF THEIR READINESS TO TAKE BACK ALL IRREGULAR MIGRANTS WHO HAVE BEEN APPREHENDED ON TURKISH WHAT
TODAY WE WERE ASSURED THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE ALL DEAR BAR FROM ENSIGN DECISION ON SOUND OF A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THE DAYS OF IRREGULAR MIGRATION TWO YOU'RE UP
HOWEVER TURKEY AS ATTACH CONDITIONS TO THE DEAL WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED AT ANOTHER E.U. SUMMIT NEXT WEEK THEY INCLUDE SPEEDING UP ITS E.U. MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION AND BRINGING FORWARD THE VISA FREE TRAVEL
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JEAN CLERGY ONGKA DESCRIBED THE AGREEMENT AS A REAL GAME CHANGER A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS FROM BRUSSELS
THIS IS A BOLD INITIATIVE BASED ON A SIMPLE PREMISE ALL IRREGULAR MIGRANTS ENTERING THE GREEK ISLANDS FROM TURKEY INCLUDING SYRIANS WOULD BE SENT BACK
BUT FOR EVERY SYRIAN CITIZEN RETURNED ANOTHER SYRIAN WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RESETTLEMENT IN THE E.U. DIRECTLY FROM A REFUGEE CAMP IN TURKEY ANYONE ATTEMPTING AN ILLEGAL CROSSING WOULD GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE QUEUE
THERE ARE PLENTY OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL PITFALLS AHEAD SO FAR THE AGREEMENT AS A SERIES OF BROAD PRINCIPLES AND THE DETAIL WILL AWAIT ANOTHER SUMMIT AT THE END OF NEXT WEEK FIERCE ARGUMENT COULD ENSUE AND IMPLEMENTATION WOULD NOT BE EASY
THE E. YOU NEED TURKEYS CO OPERATION IF IT'S TO BEGIN COPING WITH THE MIGRATION CRISIS SO THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT WOULD ALSO BE GIVEN EXTRA MONEY TO HELP IT HOST NEARLY THREE MILLION SYRIAN REFUGEES AND IF IRREGULAR MIGRATION IS BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL TURKISH CITIZENS COULD BE GIVEN VISA FREE ACCESS TO THE E. USE BORDER FREE SEND AN AREA BEFORE THE END OF JUNE
AN INDICATION OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT LIE AHEAD HAS COME WITH HUNGARY'S REJECTION OF ANY MANDATORY QUOTAS FOR ACCEPTING REFUGEES THE HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER'S SPOKESMAN ZOLTAN UNCOVER TOLD US THE BEST SOLUTION WAS TO GIVE TURKEY FINANCIAL AND OTHER ASSISTANCE TO KEEP SYRIANS AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY
BAD IDEA BECAUSE THAT WOULD INVITE MORE PEOPLE TO COME EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU'RE ACTUALLY THAT THEY'RE SPREADING THE KIND OF PROBLEM BUT ALSO

DESCRIBED AS TROUBLING THE WAY POLICE USED RESTRAINT EQUIPMENT SUCH AS LEG STRAPS AND BELTS INCIDENTS INVOLVING PATIENTS IN HOSPITAL AND THE TREATMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN ONE CASE AN OFFICER RECEIVED A FINAL WRITTEN WARNING FOR HEAD BUTTING A CHILD
A KEY MESSAGE FROM THE REPORT IS THE NEED FOR POLICE TO IMPROVE THEIR RESPONSE TO THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS WHO WERE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE THAN OTHER PEOPLE AFTER OFFICERS USED FORCE
THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FRONT RUNNER DONALD TRUMP IS HOPING TO SOLIDIFY HIS LEAD IN THE BATTLE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND HIS PARTY GOES TO THE POLLS IN FOR MORE STATES BUT THERE ARE SIGNS THAT ATTACKS FROM WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY IS STARTING TO AFFECT HIS POLL RATINGS REPORTING FROM DETROIT NICK BRYAN
A BARRAGE OF NEW ATTACK ADVERTISEMENTS HAS HIT THE AIRWAVES BETRAYING DONALD TRUMP AS A PRIME VULGARIAN WHOSE REGULAR USE OF PROFANE LANGUAGE IN HIS SPEECHES DISQUALIFY US IN FOR THE PRESIDENCY THAT CRITICISM SEEMS TO BE GAINING TRACTION NOT ONLY WAS HIS PERFORMANCE OVER THE WEEKEND WORSE THAN EXPECTED POLLS SUGGEST IS LEADING KEY STATES SUCH AS MICHIGAN OR FLORIDA HAS DWINDLED TO SINGLE DIGITS
BUT THE PROPERTY TYCOON REMAINS THE FRONT RUNNER AND SOME PARTY INSIDERS THINK IT'S TOO LATE TO STOP HIM
NICK BRYANT REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THIS COUNTRY AND CLAIM ASYLUM THREE PRIVATE COMPANIES HAVE THE TASK OF FINDING THEM SOMEWHERE TO LIVE G.FOUR.S. SERCO AND CLEAR SPRINGS WON THE CONTRACTS WHEN THE HOME OFFICE DECIDED TO OUTSOURCE THE SYSTEM IN TWENTY TWELVE
NOW THIS PROGRAMME HAS LEARNT THE DETAIL OF THE PRESSURE ON THAT SYSTEM WITH THIRTY PER CENT MORE APPLICATIONS LAST YEAR THAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THERE ISN'T ENOUGH ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE SOME ASYLUM SEEKERS HAVE BEEN PUT UP IN HOTELS SOME SINGLE MALES ARE AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT A REPORTER SEE MACA TETRA HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO THIS AND SEE ME YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT DOCUMENTS AND SPEAKING TO SOME OF THOSE WHO WORK IN THE SYSTEM YES THAT'S RIGHT MICHELLE AS YOU SAY IN TWENTY TWELVE THREE COMPANIES SERCO G.FOUR.S. IN CLEAR SPRINGS ONE CONTRACTS TO HOUSE ASYLUM SEEKERS
IN A BID TO SAVE THE GOVERNMENT MONEY IT'S THEIR JOB TO FIND THEM SUITABLE ACCOMMODATION AND I'M GO TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR APPROVAL BUT SEVERAL OF THOSE TO BE SPOKEN TO WHO WORK IN SENIOR POSITIONS FOR THESE COMPANIES SAY MANY LOCAL AUTHORITIES DON'T WANT TO TAKE ASYLUM SEEKERS GIVING REASONS SUCH AS THE AREA'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THEM OR THEY DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO COPE WITH THE EXTRA PEOPLE
OFFICIAL FIGURES SHOW THERE WERE MORE THAN THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ASYLUM APPLICATIONS LAST YEAR AND THE FIGURES HAVE BEEN RISING SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN A MANAGER WHO WORKS FOR ONE OF THE FIRM'S TOLD US THE SYSTEM IS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE HIS WORDS ARE VOICED BY SOMEONE ELSE
IT COULD BE TODAY IT COULD BE TOMORROW BUT VERY SOON THIS SYSTEM IS GOING TO BREAK DOWN BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE ROOM TO HOUSE ALL THESE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY
MOST LOCAL AUTHORITIES ASKING FOR A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF ASYLUM SEEKERS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS IS A DISASTER REALLY
DOCUMENTS FROM ONE OF THE COMPANY'S SEEN BY THIS PROGRAMME PAINT A DISMAL PICTURE THE HOUSING SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED AS DESPERATE AND GETTING WORSE IF ACTION ISN'T TAKEN NOW STAFF SAY THE PROBLEM IS THE COMPANY'S ONLY GET AROUND TEN POUNDS PER ASYLUM SEEKER PER NIGHT AND THEY OFTEN HAVE TO PUT THEM UP IN HOTELS AS THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH HOUSING THEY SAY THAT LEAVES THEM SERIOUSLY OUT OF POCKET TO THE TUNE OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION POUNDS IN SERCO'S CASE
THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THE COMPANY'S DESPERATELY WANT TO GET OUT OF THE CONTRACT WITH THE HOME OFFICE BECAUSE THEY'RE LOSING MONEY AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE MAKING A FUSS ANOTHER MANAGER WHOSE WORDS ARE ALSO SPOKEN BY SOMEONE ELSE TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITY SAYS MINISTERS NEED TO PUSH LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO DO MORE
PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT LEAVING OUR ACCOMMODATION WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUITABLE ACCOMMODATION SO WE HAVE TO PUT PEOPLE IN HOTELS EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THOSE WEE HOUSE NOW A SINGLE MALES THEY CAN BE AGGRESSIVE AND HAVE ASSAULTED A STAFF IT'S A DIRE SITUATION AND IT'S GETTING WORSE ALL THE TIME THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO PUT MORE PRESSURE ON OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TAKE THEIR SHARE OF ASYLUM SEEKERS AND NOT PUT THE BURDEN ON THOSE WHO ALWAYS DO
LAST WEEK'S REPORT BY THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE ALSO SAYS THE HOUSING SITUATION IS BEING MADE WORSE BECAUSE SOME AREAS ARE TAKING IN THEIR HUNDREDS WHILE OTHERS ARE GETTING ON STAFF SAY MANY OF THOSE SEEKING ASYLUM ARE DESPERATE AND FRUSTRATED OF COURSE IN SOME CASES THESE ARE PEOPLE FLEEING WAR TORN COUNTRIES AND HAVE A COMPLEX NEEDS FEMALE STAFFER APPARENTLY STRUGGLING TO COPE WITH THE INFLUX OF SINGLE MEN CLAIMS ONE MANAGER HER WORDS ARE ALSO VOICED BY ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS
WE HAVE A LOT OF AGGRESSIVE SO WHEN WE GOT HER PROPERTY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND A MIXER JOB INCREDIBLY SCARY IN SOME CASES THEY THREATEN YOU THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO HURT I'LL KILL YOU WE'VE HAD SOMEONE PULL THE KNIFE OUT AT US I'VE HAD SOMEONE JUMP ON ME AND IT'S HAPPENING ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY GET AWAY WITH IT THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR SHOULD MEAN THAT THEY GET SENT BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY
IN A STATEMENT THE HOME OFFICE SAYS IT CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AREAS THAT ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE SEEKING ASYLUM AND THAT EVERY LOCAL AUTHORITY IS ENCOURAGED TO CONTRIBUTE IT ALSO SAYS IT WON'T GIVE ASYLUM TO THOSE CONVICTED OF SERIOUS OFFENCES AND LASTLY MICHELLE SERCO AND CLEAR SPRINGS TOLD US THEY DIDN'T WANT TO COMMENT ON ALL OF THIS WHILE G.FOUR.S.

GOOD MORNING GET KEITH OR TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THESE SORTS OF PROBLEMS THE INCREDIBLE PRESSURE ON THE SYSTEM IS ABOUT THE JUMP IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS LAST YEAR OR IS IT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH AREAS OF THE COUNTRY WHO ARE WILLING TO TAKE THESE PEOPLE
I THINK IT'S A BIT OF BOTH IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE GIVEN BY A CHIEF ARREST THAT ORIGINALLY THEY WERE INTENDING TO OUR HOUSE NINE THOUSAND ASYLUM SEEKERS THIS IS NOW GONE UP
TO SEVENTEEN THOUSAND IN JUST THREE YEARS BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THESE BIG COMPANIES DECIDED TO BID FOR THESE CONTRACTS KNOWING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE A LOSS AND
PRIOR TO COMPASS YOU HAD A SCHEME WHERE THE GOVERNMENT DEALT WITH A LOT OF OTHER LOCAL PROVIDERS THEY DECIDED TO SHELVE THAT SCHEME AND GO FOR THE BIG PROVIDERS NOW WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH NINE POINT THIRTY TWO VAN POINT THIRTY TWO PER ASYLUM SEEKER
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO MAKE A PROFIT OF COURSE HE'S A PRIVATE COMPANIES ON THAT KIND OF FIGURE THEY'RE BOUND TO MAKE A LOSS BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE RELUCTANCE OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TAKE ON MORE ASYLUM SEEKERS WE SEEM TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH TURKEY BUT UNABLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH TUNBRIDGE WELLS OR MAIDENHEAD AWAY FOR ME THERE ARE WHOLE SWATHES OF THE COUNTRY BUT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ASYLUM SEEKERS
WHEREAS THE URBAN AREAS HAVE THOUSANDS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS SO WE DO NEED TO SIT DOWN WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND WE HAVE TO HELP FUND THEM THEY SIMPLY CANNOT DO IT ON EXISTING BUDGETS WELL LEATHER ONE SITUATION WHERE WE WILL HAVE THIS HUGE CRISIS LET ME TURN THEN TO DAVID SIMMONS DEPUTY CHAIR OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION OR WHY IS IT THAT SO MANY OF YOUR MEMBERS REFUSED TO SUPPORT ASYLUM SEEKERS AT ALL MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED OF THEM
KEITH IS RIGHT MONEY LIES AT THE HEART OF THIS WE HAVE THREE COMPANIES HAVE WON THESE CONTRACTS AT A VERY LOW PRICE WHICH EFFECTIVELY LIMITS THEM TO A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE ACCOMMODATION IS AVAILABLE AT ABSOLUTELY ROCK BOTTOM PRICES THE REASON WHY LONDON DOES NOT TAKE CHILDREN OR OTHER PEOPLE AND OF THIS PARTICULAR SCHEME
HE'S NOT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN LOST AND SAID NO IT'S BECAUSE THE ORGANISATION'S MANAGING SKINK SIMPLY CAN'T SORT ACCOMMODATION AT THAT KIND OF PRICE MANY COUNCILS INCLUDING MY OWN HAVE LARGE NUMBERS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF CHILDREN BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY ARE PLACED BY THESE PARTICULAR COMPANIES SO THE BIG CHALLENGE FOR OUR LOCAL COUNCIL IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE PLACED IN THE LOCAL AREA THAT THERE IS SUPPORT FOR THEM AND IF YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU'VE ALREADY GOT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS YOU'VE COME IN
THROUGH THE SYRIAN REFUGEE SCHEME WHICH IS SEPARATE YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY HAD SIGNIFICANT YOU'VE COME IN WHO'VE HAD THEIR ASYLUM STATUS GRANTED WERE RESIDENT IN YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES NEEDING TO ACCESS COUNCIL SERVICES AN N.H.S. BUT IS THAT THE CAIMAN MAY WELL WE DON'T KNOW ADDITIONAL CATS A LIST AND THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHICH WHICH DON'T SUPPORT ASYLUM SEEKERS AT ALL HARROGATE GREAT YARMOUTH LINCOLN METH OR TED PHIL NORTH DEVON SCARBOROUGH STAFFORD
I MEAN THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY AREAS WHERE THE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE THEY MAY NOT HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PLACED UNDER THE SPECIFIC HOME OFFICE COMPASS CONTRACTS BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE SIGNIFICANT MEMBERS IF YOU COULD FIND REASONABLY PRICED HOUSING COULDN'T YOU INSULT HIM SOME OF THESE AREAS LIKE THIS I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION THAT YOU NEED TO PUT THE PRIVATE COMPANIES A LOT ASK WHITE IS THEY'VE CHOSEN NOT TO PLACE PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS WHEN WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THOSE AREAS ALREADY DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AND INDEED IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM THE GOVERNMENT
TO HELP WITH SYRIAN REFUGEES HAS PROACTIVELY COME FORWARD AND OFFERED ACCOMMODATION WITHIN THE LOCAL AREA SO IT CAN BE FRIGHTENED THE ISSUE IS WHETHER IT CAN BE FOUND AT THE ABSOLUTELY ROCK BOTTOM PRICE THAT THESE THREE COMPANIES HAVE CONTRACTED WITH THE HOME OFFICE TO PAY AND THAT'S THE MAIN REASON WHY THEY'RE STRUGGLING AND KEITH AS THAT GOES BACK TO HOW MUCH THE HOME OFFICE HAS OFFERED HER ASYLUM SEEKER PER NIGHT NINE THIRTY FIVE IS WHAT IT IS CHIEF WATCHTREE FOR ASCOT
ABSOLUTELY THAT'S THE FIGURE THAT THEY GAVE US AND IT'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO HOUSE AND FEED AN INDIVIDUAL AT THAT KIND OF PRICE I THINK THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN
ON THE ONE HAND I THINK THE HOME OFFICE NEEDS TO LOOK AT THEIR OWN ESTATE THEY'VE GOT A IT ORGANISATION CALLED THE CEDARS WHICH IS NEAR HEATHROW AIRPORT WHERE MILLIONS OF POUNDS HAS BEEN SPENT BY THE HOME OFFICE ON ACCOMMODATION THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS PALATIAL
THAT SHOULD HAVE ITS DESIGNATION CHANGED AND IT SHOULD PROVIDE ACCOMMODATION THERE AND THEN WE'VE GOT THESE OFFERS FOR MUM AMONGST OTHERS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY AND THE PUBLIC CAME UP AND MADE HUGE OFFERS TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THEY'VE SAID WHERE PREPARED TO TAKE ASYLUM SEEKERS INTO OUR HOMES NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO LET THIS HAPPEN
AND THEY'VE PLACED EVEN MORE EMPHASIS ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE IN THE COMMITTEE BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE TO LOOK AGAIN AT THESE OFFERS AND OF PEOPLE ARE MAKING THOSE KINDS OF OFFERS
THAN THEY SHOULD BE LOOKED AT CHECKED AND IF NECESSARY IF PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO DO THIS THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED I'M GOOD AT THOSE HOMES OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT I SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IS THE PROBLEM IS THAT THAT THAT COULD BE VERY SCATTERGUN COULDN'T IT I MEAN IT DEPENDS ON WHERE PRIVATE OFFERS ARE AVAILABLE AND ANT P. PEOPLE MIGHT OFFER TO TAKE SOMEONE INTO HOMES WITHOUT KNOWING THE FULL PICTURE OF WHAT SERVICES ARE LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO IT'S NOT A SOLUTION IS IT WILL BUT THAT'S WHY THEY'VE GOT TO BE VETTED BUT YOU KNOW YOU SIMPLY CAN'T SIT ON YOUR HANDS THE PROBLEM IS THE HOME OFFICE
HE'S SITTING ON ITS HANDS AT A TIME WHEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE UNDIE UNDER HUGE PRESSURE AND IF THESE THREE BIG CONTRACTORS SUDDENLY PULL OUT THEN YOU'RE LEFT IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS NO HOUSING AVAILABLE
AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF FORWARD PLANNING IN THE HOME OFFICE OVER AN AREA THAT REQUIRES VERY CAREFUL THINKING I THINK DAVID CAMERON SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR MAKING THE COMMITMENT TO TAKING TWENTY THOUSAND SYRIAN REFUGEES AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH A THOUSAND CAME IN HER BEFORE CHRISTMAS THEY HAVE ALL BEEN HOUSED WITHOUT ANY CONTROVERSY
I THINK THEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES THAT THEY'VE ADOPT OVER THE SYRIAN REFUGEES IN THE SAME WAY AS THEY DEAL WITH OTHER ASYLUM SEEKERS AND THAT MEANS SITTING DOWN
PATIENTLY AS THEY DONE WITH TURKEY AND TALK TO TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND TALK TO MAIDENHEAD TALK TO WAIVE ANY TALK TO ALL THOSE OTHER COUNCILS THAT HAVE THE FIGURES ZERO
NEXT TO THEIR NAMES AND SEE IF THEY CAN PERSUADE THEM TO BE PART OF THE SYSTEM BUT IT DOES MEAN PROVIDING MORE MONEY SEE IF THEY CAN PERSUADE THEM DAVID SIMMONS IS THAT IS THERE IS THE BIG QUESTION COS IT MAY BE THAT ACTUALLY HOWEVER MUCH MONEY THEY ARE OFFERED ASSUMING THAT IS AVAILABLE ACTUALLY THEY MIGHT HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WE DON'T REALLY WANT THEM HERE THE ASYLUM SEEKERS WHAT THOSE COUNCILS ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS HAVE COME FORWARD IN RESPONSE TO THE SYRIAN SCHEME THEY HAVE MADE OFFERS OF HOUSING AND THE KEY DIFFERENCES THAT IT'S CLEAR RIGHT FROM THE START WITH THE SYRIAN SCHEME
PEOPLE ARE ARRIVING IN THE U.K. ENTITLED TO ACCESS COUNCIL SUPPORT WHICH IS NOT THE CASE WITH ASYLUM SEEKERS WERE NOT ALLOWED AND YOU CANNOT APPLY FOR COUNCIL HOUSING BUT ALSO THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN GET ACCOMMODATION IN THE LOCAL AREA AT A PRICE THAT IS AFFORDABLE DAVID SIMMONDS AND KEITH THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH

STATES BOOK WOULDN'T APPLY TO BRITAIN
CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT SEEN BY THIS PROGRAMME WARNED THAT THE SYSTEM FOR HOUSING ASYLUM SEEKERS IS BREAKING POINT ONE OF THE THREE COMPANIES IN CHARGE OF FINDING ACCOMMODATION FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS SAYS THE SHORTAGE OF HOUSING IS RAPIDLY GETTING WORSE AND IN NEED OF DRASTIC REFORM
WITHIN THE PAST FEW MINUTES IT'S EMERGED THAT BORIS JOHNSON HAS OVERTURNED THE DECISION BARRING HIS STAR FROM OPPOSING HIS CALL FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. MY JOHNSON'S CHIEF OF STAFF HAD SENT AN EMAIL TO SENIOR STAFF LAST WEEK TELLING THEM NOT TO CONTRADICT THE MAYOR IN PUBLIC HOWEVER THIS MORNING THE MAYOR DESCRIBED A DECISION AS A COCK UP
NIKE HAS SUSPENDED ITS TIES WITH THE FORMER WORLD TENNIS CHAMPION MARIA SHARAPOVA WHO'S FAILED A DRUGS TEST SHE FACES A LENGTHY BAN AFTER TESTING POSITIVE FOR A DRUG ADDED TO THE BANNED SUBSTANCE LISTON IN JANUARY BEFORE THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON HAS CARRIED OUT A RATHER ABRUPT U. TURN AFTER LEARNING THAT HIS SENIOR STAFF HAD BEEN TOLD BY SOMEONE IN HIS OFFICE THAT IF THEY DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIS VIEWS ON THE E.U. THAT BRITAIN SHOULD VOTE TO LEAVE THEN THEY SHOULD STAY SILENT IN THIS OF COURSE AFTER A WEEKEND WHEN HE'D ACCUSE THOSE WHO WANT TO STAY IN A CRUSHING DISSENT AND SAID THAT IT WAS A SCANDAL AT THE BOSS OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE
AT TWO STEP ASIDE THERE WERE HE WAS IN DANGER OF BEING ACCUSED OF HYPOCRISY OUR POLITICAL EDITOR IS LAURA COONS BERG AND LAURA THIS IS PRESUMABLY WHY WE HAVE THIS SUDDEN U. TURN
I THINK TO SAY THAT IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE IS SOMETHING OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT AS YOU SAY IN THE LAST FEW DAYS BORIS JOHNSON HAS VERY LOUDLY AND PROUDLY NOT JUST BEEN MAKING HIS OWN CASE TO LEAVE THE E.U. BUT DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS TO DO IT USING WORDS LIKE GAGGING PEOPLE SING THAT PROJECT FEAR OR THAT SORT OF NUMBER TEN OPERATIONAL BEEN TRYING TO CRUSH DISSENT AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD AND EMAIL FROM NONE OTHER THAN HIS CHIEF OF STAFF NOT JUST SOMEBODY ROUND THEM IN HIS OFFICE AN EMAIL FROM HIS CHIEF OF STAFF TO HIS MOST SENIOR TEAM
SAID THAT THEY WERE TO ADVOCATE THE MAYOR'S POSITION OR OTHERWISE NOT OPENLY TO CONTRADICT IT THAT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLY ALONGSIDE WHAT HE'D BEEN SAYING PUBLICLY AND US IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES HE'S TOLD THE B. B. C. INSTEAD HE WANTS TO LET A THOUSAND FLOWERS BOOT BLOOM AND IN FACT HE HAS NOW DECIDED THIS EDICT WILL NO LONGER BE AND FOR US I WOULD SAY THOUGH WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THAT WILL MEAN AT THIS STAGE HE SAID THAT VERY CLEARLY ON THE RECORD NOW
BUT THIS IS THE OFFICIAL ADVICE FROM CITY HALL THAT HAS BEEN SET OUT IN BLACK AND WHITE CIRCULAR ELATED AMONGST HIS TEAM SO WHETHER OR NOT WILL SUDDENLY SEE PEOPLE ALLOWED TO SPEAK OUT IF THEY WANT TO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR WHAT HAPPENS NEXT I GET SO IT WOULD APPEAR THAT HE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THAT ADVICE GOING OUT HE KNEW ABOUT THE ISSUE BUT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS PARTICULAR EMAIL AS I UNDERSTAND IT SO HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SIX INSTRUCTION HAD BEEN SORT OF ISSUES IN THIS WAY BUT HE WAS AWARE OF THE ISSUE
AND OF COURSE THIS SOUNDS LIKE A VERY SORT OF MICRO DETAIL ABOUT THE KIND OF PROCESSES THAT ARE GOING ON HERE BUT THIS ON MATTERS ENORMOUSLY BECAUSE TEMPERS ARE RUNNING SO HIGH INSIDE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OVER THIS WHOLE DEBATE THAT EVERY SINGLE MOVE THAT'S BEEN MADE BY THE SENIOR FIGURES IN THIS CONVERSATION THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT STAYING OR LEAVING THE E.U.
HE'S ABSOLUTELY UNDER THE MICROSCOPE THERE'S HUGE SCRUTINY ON EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING AND IT'S ALREADY WHAT ONE MINISTER DESCRIBED TO ME YESTERDAY AS A VERY BITTER AND BAD TEMPERED DEBATE AND OF COURSE PARALLELS MAY BE DRAWN BY SOME PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE HERE TO USE THE POSITION THAT DAVID CAMERON TOOK IN TERMS OF ALLOWING HIS CABINET TO CAMPAIGN AFTER SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE FROM YOUR SCEPTICS I SHOULD ADD
ALLOWING MEMBERS OF THE CABINET TO CAMPAIGN ON EITHER SIDE AND THIS ADVICE THAT HAD ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED GONE OUT TO PEOPLE IN CITY HALL THIS IS SO DELICATE IT IS SO BETTER ALREADY IN THE TORY PARTY THAT ALL OF THESE MOVES REALLY REALLY DO MATTER IN THE OVERALL CONTEXT FOR THE DEBATE LAURA KINSBERG THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE EVERY DAY THIS WEEK WE ARE ILLUSTRATING THE NEWS HEADLINES IF YOU GO TO OUR WEBSITE BBC DOT CO DOT U.K. FORWARD SLASH TODAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND NEWS ILLUSTRATED WHICH IS AN ANIMATED VIDEO IT'S A BIT OF AN EXPERIMENT IN TELLING THE NEWS IN A WAY THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT BEFORE SO HAVE A LOOK IF YOU CAN ON OUR WEBSITE
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINE ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THIS WEEK HUBERT PARRY PUT IN HIS DIARY WROTE A TUNE FOR SOME WORDS OF BLAKE'S BRIDGES SENT ME
BRIDGES WAS THE POET LAUREATE ROBERT BRIDGES BLAKE REFERRED TO WILLIAM BLAKE AND THE TUNE WAS JERUSALEM
IN IN IN IN
WELL THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF JERUSALEM WITH THE SOPRANO AMANDA ROE CRAFT AND THE B.B.C. NATIONAL CHORUS OF WALES WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT GALVANISING BRITISH ATTITUDES IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR SHOULD IT NOW BE USED TO GALVANISE THE ENGLISH WHEN THEY NEED AN ANTHEM THAT IS NOT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
JOINING US TO CONSIDER THAT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS PIECE A PROFESSOR JEREMY DIBBLE FROM DURHAM UNIVERSITY SIR HUBERT PARRY'S BIOGRAPHER AND WE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY MICHAEL HOROVITZ THE POET WHO HE'S BEEN INFLUENCED BY BOTH PARIS AND WILLIAM BLAKE GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR DIBBLE IT'S MARVELLOUS TO HEAR THAT IN THE DESCRIPTION OF WROTE A TUNE JUST SO BLITHELY AS IF IT'S A LITTLE DITTY
HE WAS HE WAS ASKED BY BRIDGES TO WRITE IT IN MARCH NINETEEN SIXTEEN FINISHED IT UP FINISH IT ON THE TENTH OF MARCH AND IT WAS TRIED OUT BY THE
BOYS OF THE CITY OF LONDON SCHOOL ACTUALLY WITH WALFORD DAVIES WHO WAS THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC AT THE TEMPLE CHURCH AND THEN HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME PUBLICLY ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MARCH WHEN IT WAS AN INSTANT SUCCESS AND IT BECAME
IT WAS TAKEN UP BY DIFFERENT GROUPS FOR DIFFERENT REASONS NOT THE SORT OF FACTOR RATHER SORT OF DURING JINGOISTIC TONE THAT QUICKLY BECAME ATTACHED TO IT WELL IT WAS WRITTEN FOR FOR THIS MOVEMENT CALLED FIGHT FOR RIGHT WHICH WAS A MOVEMENT REALLY TO BOLSTER I THINK BRITISH MORALE
AT THE HEIGHT OF THE WAR WHEN THE NEWS OF THE TERRIBLE CASUALTIES WERE COMING THROUGH AND TO REASSURE PEOPLE THAT ARE DECISIVE VICTORY WAS WHAT WAS NEEDED PARTICULARLY IN THE LIGHT OF THOSE WHO WERE THINKING ABOUT MAYBE BRINGING THE WAR TO A PREMATURE END AND I'M IN PARIS AGREED WITH THIS IDEA BUT
LATTERLY HE BECAME A BIT WORRIED WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TALK ABOUT RECRIMINATIONS PENALTIES AGAINST THE GERMANS WHEN THE VICTORY CAME ABOUT AND HE TURNED INSTEAD TO THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT WHICH HIS WIFE WAS A GREAT SUPPORTER OF AND SO WAS HE
THE SUFFRAGIST MOVEMENT THE POLITICAL WING OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE AND IT GRADUALLY BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH WOMEN'S VOTERS WOMEN'S NATIONAL MILITARY SERVICE AND OF COURSE LATER ON WITH THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE WHEN THEY TOOK IT UP IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR MICHAEL HOROVITZ DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD NOW BE USED AS AN ENGLISH AT THEM IN THOSE CASES WHERE ENGLAND NEEDS SOME AND AT THE MINUTE FEELS PERHAPS INAPPROPRIATE TO USE IN THE LAST LAP YES WORLD THERE FOR A TRENT OFF
AND DID THOSE FEET BEING WITH HER IT WAS NEVER ACTUALLY CALLED JERUSALEM BY BLAKE JERUSALEM WAS ONE OF BLAKE'S LAST FEW LONGER POEMS THIS AND DID THOSE FEET WAS WRITTEN AS A PREFACE TO HIS EVEN LONGER EPIC POEM MILTON AND IT WAS VERY MUCH TO AFFIRM JERUSALEM AS HER ONLY
PLACE THAT POSSIBLY IN THE FIRST LINE AND WITH THOSE FEARS DIDN'T ALLUDES POSSIBLY TOO JEALOUS OF HAVING BROUGHT TROOPS SOUTHWESTERN ENGLAND BIO TURN MERCHANT
POSSIBLY THE PROPHECIES THAT THERE WOULD BE A NEW JERUSALEM AND THAT LIKE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND SECOND COMING COULD HAPPEN PERHAPS ROOTED IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL ENGLAND FOR BLEEDING SO WE SHOULDN'T BE PUT OFF BY THE TITLE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR IT TO BE AN ENGLISH ANTHEM
VERY MUCH SO BLAKE WAS VERY VERY ENGLISH HE NEVER
ENGLAND BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE WAS ANTI NATIONALIST STATE AND HE WORE VERY MUCH A PACIFIST AND A REPUBLICAN AND EVENTUALLY WROTE IN HIS POEM LONDON OBSERVING AND THE HAPLESS SOLDIER'S BLANCH RUN RUN
HAPLESS SOLDIER'S SIGH RUNS IN BLOOD DOWN PALACE WALLS AND WHEN RELATIVE JERUSALEM IT WAS USUALLY A WOMAN ENGLAND AWAKE AWAKE AWAKE JERUSALEM THY SISTER CALLS AND IN A WAY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN RATHER EVEN MORE OFFENDER THAN PARIS WHEN IT BECAME USED BY SOME ELEMENTS IN THE FIGHT FOR MOVEMENT AS A WAY OF
ABSOLUTELY OBLITERATED IN GERMANY AND HE LIKE PARIS WHO PREFERRED BRAHMS AND TRUE BISMARCK HE JUST LIKE THAT AND IT WAS IN EDWARD ELGAR'S ORCHESTRATION AND US BEING USED IN THE WAY OF POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD
OH LOUD BURST WOULD KNOCK THEM FLAT THEN ERNIE PARIS VERSION WASN'T GOING TO NO HOME FLUSH ENOUGH AND PRODUCE THIS MUCH MORE THUMPING ANTHEM IN A SENSE BIRTHPLACE FROM PARIS DIDN'T BLOW GOOD PROFESSOR DIBBLE DO YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR IT TO BE TAKEN AS AN ENGLISH ANTHEM
I THINK I THINK THE GREAT THING ABOUT JERUSALEM APART FROM THE FACT THAT IT'S AN EXTREMELY SKILFULLY COMPOSED I THINK BY A THOROUGHLY PROFESSIONAL COMPOSER
IT'S VERY SINGABLE IT IT SITS RIGHT BANG SLAP IN THE RANGE OF MOST PEOPLE'S VOICES IT'S NOT
TOO HIGH THE CLIMAX ON THE NOTE E. TILL WE HAVE BUILT JERUSALEM
HE'S JUST PERFECT I THINK FOR FOR EVERYBODY AND HE GOES DOWN TO A LOW B. WHICH SITS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM END OF PEOPLE'S VOICES TALK TO DO I THINK THIS IS THIS IS IDEAL HIM BUT FOR PARIS THE WATCHWORD WAS FOR DEMOCRACY HE HE SAID TO VAUGHAN WILLIAMS HIS ILLUSTRIOUS PUPIL RIGHT CHORAL MUSIC THAT BEFITS AN ENGLISHMAN AND A DEMOCRAT
AND I THINK JERUSALEM THE IDEA THAT JERUSALEM MIGHT BE SUNG BY LOTS OF PEOPLE IN AN IDEALISTIC WAY WOULD HAVE PLEASED HIM A GREAT DEAL
PROFESSOR JEREMY DIBBLE AND MICHAEL HOROVITZ THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THEN CLEAR THE TIME IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE HIS SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE ATTEMPTING TO CARVE OUT A NEW STRONGHOLD ON THE BORDER BETWEEN TUNISIA AND LIBYA THAT IS WHAT THE TUNIS IN PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID
AFTER AN ATTACK ON A TUNISIAN TOWN SEVERAL SEVEN CIVILIANS ARE NINE MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES WERE KILLED AS WELL AS AROUND THIRTY MILITANTS WE'RE JOINED FROM OXFORD BY THE FORMER BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO LIBYA OLIVER MILES GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING DO YOU THINK THIS IS AS THE GENUS AND GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SAYING AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A NEW EMIRATE
WELL IT'S RATHER DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT ELSE THE OBJECTIVE COULD'VE BEEN IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE OF A KIND OF ATTACK ON A ON A PARTICULAR TARGET SO THAT MAY HAVE BEEN IN THEIR MIND IF SO IT WAS REALLY VERY OLD CHARGE BECAUSE THEY'D COMPLETELY LOST THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THAT ALREADY BEEN SEVERAL INCIDENTS WHICH WILL DRAW ATTENTION TO THIS BORDER IN FACT THE DEFENCE SECRETARY SAID IN PARLIAMENT LAST WEEK
WE JUST SENT TWENTY BRITISH SOLDIERS TO TRY AND HELP THAT HAVE IT IMPROVE THEIR BORDER PROTECTION SO WHAT WOULD THIS BORDER HAVE BEEN LIKE IN GADDAFI'S TIME IN LIBYA WOULD IT HAVE BEEN PROPERLY POLICED
YES IT WAS YES IT WAS POLICED YES ON BOTH SIDES I REMEMBER PROPERLY IT MYSELF THERE WAS PERFECTLY PERFECTLY NORMAL IT SHOULDN'T IT'S A DESERT AREA HOW THERE'S NOTHING THERE EXCEPT A COUPLE OF SMALL OFFICES OR
BUILDINGS WHERE THE LOCAL CUSTOMS AND TOM WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S CHANGED SINCE THEN THAT WAS THEN GOT GO DOWN THE TONGUE WHICH WAS WAS THE SUBJECT AS ATTACK IS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES INSIDE CONDITION BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE NOW IS A LIBYAN IN HER
STATE OF FLUX AND THE BLACK OF GOVERNANCE IN THAT COUNTRY IS IS THERE A REAL DANGER FROM THAT TO OTHER PARTS OF THE REGION A BIT BUT THIS TUNE US IN TOWN IS LITERALLY JUST ACROSS THE BORDER FROM LIBYA YES THERE IS A DANGER THE THE THE MAIN DANGER FROM LIBYA IS NOT SO MUCH THE FIGHTERS WHICH THE ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF AUNTS WHICH ARE
UNPROTECTED IN LIBYA BECAUSE BUT THAT HE WAS AN OBSESSIVE COLLECTOR ALARM FROM EUROPE THE PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY STUFFED WITH ARMS AND THAT'S DAMAGED THE SECURITY POSITION ACROSS THE WHOLE OF NORTH AFRICA SLIPS THE COLLAPSE OF THE REGIME FOUR YEARS AGO FOR THE FIGHTERS THEMSELVES YET YES THEY ARE A THREAT BUT THERE ARE LIMITED THREAT AND THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD SOMEHOW REPEAT IN TUNISIA
THE LIGHTNING SUCCESS THEY HAD AN IRAQ CROWD A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I THINK HIS PROFIT BUT A BITCHY NESSA HAS ITS OWN PROBLEMS WITH WITH EXTREMISM IT PRODUCES MORE PEOPLE WHO GO OFF TO JOIN HIS LUM IS THE STREAM IS GROUPS AND IRAQ'S HERE OLIVIA THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE REGION WOULD YOU YOU WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT TERRITORY COULD BE HELD BY ONE OF THOSE GROUPS AS HAS BEEN THE CASE
IN SYRIA WHEN YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF TUNISIANS TAKING PART IN FACT I BELIEVE MOST OF THE TUNISIANS BOTH IN THIS INCIDENT YESTERDAY AND IN THAT INSTANT I'D VOTE TO HAVE GOT OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS MOST OF THE ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS ARE IN FACT TWO MUSEUMS SOME OF THEM ARE LIBYANS AND SOME OF THEM ARE OTHER OTHER ARABS
BUT THE IDEA THAT TUNISIA IS SOMEHOW RIGHT FOR AND ISLAMIC STATE TAKEOVER I THINK IS QUITE WRONG BUT IT IS IT A WAKE UP CALL IN TERMS OF
PERCEPTION OF OF THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE WORLD THIS STRETCH OF COASTLINE SHOULD WE BE DOING MORE TO TRY AND STEM EXTREMISM IN A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW WHERE WHERE TACKLING IRE STRONGHOLDS IN SYRIA
WE FACE A DILEMMA IF WE IF WE WERE TO BECOME DIRECTLY INVOLVED NOW IN LIBYA BUT WHERE THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT
ALL WE WOULD BE DOING WOULD BE STRENGTHENING THOSE ELEMENTS IN LIBYA WHO ARE LIABLE TO BE SOME PATHETIC DARIUS THEY'D BE SAYING WELL THE FOREIGNERS ARE GOING TO TAKE US OVER AGAIN IT SHOULD BE VERY LITTLE AGAIN IT'S NO IT'S COLONIALISM AGAIN THAT'S WHY THE BRITISH AND ITALIAN AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS WHICH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SUPPORTING THE SECURITY
IN LIBYA HAVE BEEN SAYING VERY CLEARLY WHEN THERE IS A LIBYAN GOVERNMENT WHICH INVITES A SCENE WE WILL DO THIS BUT NOT AT ALL I AM AND I THINK THAT'S
WE'VE GOT TO STICK TO IT IT'S A NERVOUS BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE IS A THREAT FROM THAT AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT WILL ALL GO WRONG BUT I THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY TO GO THE ROLE IF WE INTERVENED WITHOUT AN INVITATION OLIVER MILES THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO NINE ON THIS PROGRAMME YESTERDAY WE HEARD THE STORY OF MATTHEW GARNETT HE'S A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WITH SEVERE AUTISM HE'S BEING HELD IN AN EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC WARD BECAUSE HE ASSAULTED HIS FAMILY THEY SAY THEY KEEP BEING TOLD BY N.H.S. ENGLAND THAT HE WILL BE MOVED TO A MORE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT UNIT BUT HE'S NOW BEEN THERE SIX MONTHS HIS FATHER ROBIN GARNER TOLD ME WHAT EFFECT IT'S HAD ON MATTHEW
IT'S A WHOLE KING FIFTEEN YEAR OLD YOUNG ADULT BUT HE KIND OF SEES A WORLD LIKE A FIVE YEAR OLD SO FOR HIM HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S THERE HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT HE'S ILL IN ANY WAY HE SEES ILLNESS AS A PHYSICAL THING SO THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SENSE OF A BUILDING HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE IN WHERE THE DOORS ARE LOCKED AS THAT HE MUST BE IN PRISON SO HE HE SEES IT AS A PUNISHMENT FOR WHAT HE DID SIX MONTHS AGO
AND HIS MOTHER WROTE IT ON A WEBSITE THAT HE BEEN FEELS TRAPPED ALONE IN A PLACE UNEQUIPPED TO LOOK AFTER HIM WHEN THEY PUT A PETITION ONLINE CALLING FOR HIM TO BE FOUND A PLACE IT'S NOW BEEN SIGNED BY NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WE WERE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY SARAH LAMBERT HE'S HEAD OF POLICY AT THE NATIONAL AUTISTIC SOCIETY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND ANYWAY THE RESPONSE THAT PETITIONS
CERTAINLY FROM WHAT THE FAMILY COULD SEE WAS THAT THIS IS JUST REFLECTING A MUCH WIDER PROBLEM OF ACCESS TO PROPER TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE IN THIS SORT OF SITUATION HOW BAD IS IT
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY MATTY SITUATION IS INCREDIBLY UNACCEPTABLE NEEDS TO BE ACTUALLY ADDRESSED A CHIEF EXECUTIVE RATES THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF N.H.S. ENGLAND YESTERDAY SIMON STEPHEN'S TASK FOR HIS SCENT INTERVENTION BECAUSE HE'S BEEN STUCK THERE FOR SIX MONTHS HIS CITY SITUATION ISN'T GETTING ANY BETTER IS NOT GETTING THE HELP THAT HE AND HE DESPERATELY NEEDS AND THERE'S A REAL LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ACROSS HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE SERVICES OF THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH AUTISM
AND HE NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE UNDERSTANDING WITHIN THE SYSTEM SO THAT CHILDREN CAN GET HELP MUCH EARLIER SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP BEING SECTIONED AND END UP IN THESE UNITS THAT ACTUALLY AREN'T HELPING THEM AND AND SOME CASES EVEN MAKING THEM WORSE AND HIS FAMILY HAD BEEN TOLD THAT A PLACE HAD BEEN FOUND FOR HIM IN A PLACE THAT THEY THINK WOULD BE GOOD BUT THEY JUST KEEP BEING TOLD IT WILL HAPPEN IT WILL HAPPEN WITHIN A MATTER OF A COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU'LL HAVE WHEN THEY'VE BEEN TOLD THAT WAS SIX MONTHS AND WHAT OF THE ISSUE WITH IT WITH THE PLACEMENT THAT THEY FIND FOR HIM
IS THAT THERE'S ABOUT FIVE YOUNG PEOPLE THERE ALREADY WE'VE BEEN TOLD WHO ARE READY TO GO BACK TO THAT THEIR FAMILIES OR TO GO YOU KNOW TO GO BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THEM SO THERE'S A REAL KIND OF ISSUE IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY IMPROVING THE SUPPORT AVAILABLE AT A LOWER LEVEL SO THAT THOSE WHO DO YOU NEED THAT VERY KIND OF SPECIALIST SUPPORT CAN GET THAT AND THEN MOVE ON AND BACK INTO INTO THE COMMUNITIES AND BACK WITH THE RIGHT SUPPORT
IN THEIR IN THEIR LOCALITY AS EVER IT'S THE FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER REALLY SHOCKING THING THAT HIS FATHER ROBERT GARNET TOLD US YESTERDAY WAS THAT HE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHO TO SPEAK TO TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE THERE'S A WRECK THERE'S A REAL COMPLEXITY IN TERMS OF HOW THE EIGHT THE N.H.S. WORKS AND HERE WHO'S HELD ACCOUNTABLE IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR FIRST AS POLICY MAKERS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE CLIPPED MUCH CLOSER TO IT TO UNDERSTAND
WHO COMMISSIONS WHAT THIS PARTICULAR SERVICE THAT HE'S TRYING TO GO INTO HIS COMMISSION TO A NATIONAL LEVEL WHEREAS YOU TO EDEN INITIALLY THINK YOU'D TO IT'S TO LOCAL SERVICES IT IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND CONFUSING THAT WASN'T THERE ALSO RELATIVELY RECENTLY A PROPOSAL THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE ONE CONTACT WHEN IN THE HEALTH SERVICE THERE SHOULD BE SOMEBODY THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN GO TO SOME A NAMED INDIVIDUAL
WHO CAN EFFECTIVELY MEAN MAYBE THE DREAM BUT IN THIS CASE IT SEEMS SO FAR AWAY IT'S DEFINITELY NOT WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE FAMILIES THAT WE TALK TO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT AND CONTACT WITH THE HEALTH OR SOCIAL CARE SERVICES SAY THAT THEY'RE REALLY ISN'T IT IT REALLY IS A KIND OF
MINEFIELD TO KIND OF WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH IS IT ULTIMATELY THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PLACES NOT ENOUGH BEDS IN THE RIGHT UNITS OR IS IT JUST THE MANAGEMENT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SYSTEM ALREADY I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE OF BOTH SO THERE'S BEEN A REAL MOVE BY N.H.S. ENGLAND TO ACTUALLY TRY AND CLOSE DOWN SOME OF THESE BEDS COS THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY HELD IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION WHEN THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T BE THEY AND THEY CAN BE SPORT IT'S MORE LIKELY IT WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO HAPPEN
BUT ACTUALLY FOR THOSE WITH REALLY SPECIALISTS VERY COMPLEX NEEDS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME HAVING THEM IN THAT VERY SORT OF SPECIALIST UNIT IS WHAT'S NEEDED BUT THEY ARE AND THEY ARE AN ICE CHALLENGE GEOGRAPHICALLY BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WILL NEED THAT TYPE OF SPORT AT ANY ONE TIME BUT HE'S ALSO THAT REAL NEED FOR FOR THAT FOR THAT RIGHT HELP TO BE AVAILABLE AT A MORE LOCAL LEVEL AT LOWER DOWN SO SARAH LAMBERT THANK YOU VERY MUCH

RICKY REALLY GREAT REALLY GREAT WHY DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR SONGS TRANSLATED SO WELL YOU KNOW IT'S BRITISH AUDIENCES ARE WORRIED THEY MIGHT BE TWO CLIP OF HUMANITY

ONE OF THE SONGS FROM THE ALBUM TAPESTRY WHICH ENDED UP SELLING TWENTY FIVE MILLION COPIES AROUND THE WORLD CAROLE KING WILL BE AT THE B. ESTE FESTIVAL IN HYDE PARK THIS SUMMER IN TICKETS GO ON SALE AT THE END OF THE WEEK
THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES TO NINE MANY OF THE FRONT PAGES THIS MORNING CARRY PHOTOS OF THE BOBBLE HATTED DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE ARE LARKING ABOUT IN THE SNOW WITH THEIR TWO CHILDREN THEY WERE TAKEN BY ONE PRESS ASSOCIATION PHOTOGRAPHER AND RELEASED AFTER THE FAMILY CAME BACK SOME OF THE PAPERS COO OVER THE IMAGES BUT OTHERS ARE FAR MORE CRITICAL NOT LEAST THE SUN WHICH REFERS TO WORK SHY WILLS TALKS FROM SHIRKING HIS JOB AND ROYAL DUTIES
SO COULD IT REPRESENT A SHIFT IN ATTITUDES TO THE YOUNG ROYAL COUPLE WE'RE JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY ROBERT JUMPS JOBSON HE'S ROYAL EDITOR AT THE LONDON EVENING STANDARD AND WE JOIN THE LINE BY NEIL WALLIS WHO USED TO BE EDITOR OF THE SUNDAY PEOPLE AN EXECUTIVE EDITOR AT NEWS OF THE WORLD WHAT
MY MEAL WHAT DO YOU THINK THERE IS SOMETHING IN THIS HOUSE NOT LEAST I A MENTION THE SUN'S COVERAGE IT'S NOT JUST THE SUN THOUGH THAT'S POINTING OUTTA QUESTIONING THE WAY THEY'RE HANDLING THIS I'M FINE IT'S A GREAT TURNING POINT
AND THERE COULD BE A QUESTION THAT THE SUN IS ASKING ROBERT JOHNSON IS THE SUN TOLD TWO WEEKS AGO HOW WILLIAM HAD DONE JUST A HANDFUL OF SHIPS AS AN AIR AMBULANCE PILOT SO FAR THIS YEAR AND ONLY THREE ROYAL ENGAGEMENTS HILL SAYS I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A SHIFT AS THE SHIFT HAS COME WITH THE CHANGE OF EDITOR OF THE SUN WITH TONY GALLAGHER HE'S OBVIOUSLY DECIDED TO HAVE A GO AT PRINCE WILLIAM CALLING IN WORKSHY MAKING THESE ACCUSATIONS I WOULD SAY THAT IS NOT WORKSHY HAVE THINK HE'S WORKING UM AS THIS AS PIKE IS DOING THE DUTIES
THE SAME NEWSPAPERS IN THE SAME TABLOIDS WILL BE COOING ALL OVER THE ROYAL COUPLE WITH THE GOATS IN APRIL AND EXPECT HIM TO BE TREATED IN THAT WAY BUT MY MY FEELING ON THIS ONE IS THAT THEY'VE GOT SOME FACTS BASICALLY WRONG ABOUT THIS WHOLE PHOTO CALL NUMBER ONE IS LIKE I WAS ON THERE SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO
AND THEN ON THE EXPRESS WHEN WHEN THESE PHOTOGRAPHS PHOTO CALLS AS THEY WERE CALLED FOR THE SNOW THE PRIVATE HOLIDAYS USED TO TAKE PLACE THEY WERE NEVER WOULD NOBLES EVER INVITED TO GO AND HIS VENTRICLES WE WOULD AS THE RAT PACK JAMES WHITTAKER HARRY ARNOLD
AND THE LIKE WOOD WOULD SHARE THE INFORMATION ON PRIVATE HOLIDAYS FOR THERE'S ONE SIMPLE REASON THAT WE KNOW ON BASS WE COULD EFFECTIVELY FORCED THE MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY I UP THROUGH THE PLEASED TO DO A NEGOTIATED DEAL THAT THEY WOULD DO A PHOTO CALL COS HE USED TO BE A SET OF ANNUAL WHICH WE WOULD HAVE THAT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SHOT OF THE ROYALS ON THE FIRST DAY OF THEY'RE CREATURES OF HABIT THEY USED TO GO TO THE SAME PLACES AT THE SAME TIME SO WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA BYE
OVER YEARS THAT WHERE THEY WOULD GO BECAUSE WE BUILT UP CONTACTS IN THOSE SKI RESORTS WHICH WERE AMONGST THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND IT WAS A FUN TIME TO BE REPORTING ON ON THAT ONLY ON THIS GIG BUT THE REALITY IS THAT YOU THAT THESE THIS COUPLE HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IT THE SUN THE MIRROR THE MALL ALL THEIR ROYAL CORRESPONDS ME INCLUDED THE ABSTAINED I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SEND
HAVE BEEN AT THAT THEY'VE GOT AWAY THIS HOLIDAY I'VE GOT BACK AND IT'S UPSET THEM WELL IT'S NOT REALLY THE THOUGHT OF THE ROYAL THAT'S THE TABLOIDS WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING IN THAT I MEAN THEY GO TO COURCHEVAL NOBODY ACTUALLY BLOWS THE WHISTLE ON THEM HAVING BRIBE A HOLIDAY AND THEN HACKS ARE JUST A BIT HACKED OFF
NO THERE'S NO RULES AND REGULATIONS I TWEETED ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND SOMEBODY IMMEDIATELY CAME BACK TO ME AND SAID WHAT ABOUT PRINCESS DIANA
QUITE RIGHT BUT THE SNUFF WHICH GENTLEMEN BUT THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING THE WEIRDER GOING ON THESE TRIPS THEY DO WE HAVE THE INFORMATION

THEY HAVE THEY HAD UNTIL RECENTLY A VERY POOR REPUTATION FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY WERE FINED TWENTY SIX MILLION POUNDS BY THE REGULATOR IN DECEMBER THAT I DEAL WITH THAT IN SOME VERY IMMEDIATE WAY BY CUTTING JOBS SO IT IS ABOUT THEM NOT ABOUT THE ENERGY INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE NO IT'S VERY SPECIFIC I THINK TO N.
