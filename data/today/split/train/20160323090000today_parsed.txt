THE OTHER MAIN STORY THIS MORNING THE FUTURE OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST KNOWN HIGH STREET CHAINS B.H.S. WILL BE DECIDED BY ITS CREDITORS TODAY WAS WHAT TODAY'S PROGRAMME IN THE LAST WEEK WE'VE HAD MAJOR TERRORIST INCIDENTS IN ISTANBUL AND BRUSSELS HAS SOMETHING CHANGED AND SHOULD WE CHANGE THE WAY WE REACT TO IT

NEWS IS READ BY NEIL SLEET POLICE IN BELGIUM ARE SEARCHING FOR A MAN WHO IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH YESTERDAY'S SUICIDE BOMBINGS IN BRUSSELS THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE DIED AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OTHERS WERE WOUNDED MANY OF THEM SERIOUSLY IN THE BLASTS OF THE CITY'S AIRPORT AND AT A METRO STATION FROM BRUSSELS CHRIS MORRIS REPORT
FLAGS ARE FLYING AT HALF MAST AS BELGIUM OBSERVES THREE DAYS OF NATIONAL MOURNING THE POLICE HAVE ISSUED A WANTED NOTICE FOR A MAN CAPTURED ON FOOTAGE FROM A SECURITY CAMERA AT SEVENTEEN AIRPORT WEARING A WHITE JACKET IN A BLACK HAT HE WAS PUSHING A LUGGAGE TROLLEY WITH A SUITCASE BUT IS THOUGHT TO HAVE CONTAINED A BOMB THAT DIDN'T EXPLODE TO OTHER MEN PICTURED ALONGSIDE HIM ARE PRESUMED TO HAVE BLOWN THEMSELVES UP
THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE GROUP SAID IT CARRIED OUT THE ATTACKS AND IT SAID THE EXPLOSION ON THE BRUSSELS METRO WAS ALSO THE WORK OF A SUICIDE BOMBER POLICE RAIDS HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE SCAR BUT NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BRUSSELS REPORTEDLY AFTER A TIP OFF FROM A TAXI DRIVER ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE DEVICE PACKED WITH NAILS AND AN I. S. FLAG WERE AMONG THE ITEMS RECOVERED
HUNDREDS OF TROOPS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO PATROL THE STREETS OF BRUSSELS SOME OF THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT NETWORK AS EXPECTED TO RUN AS USUAL BUT THE AIRPORT REMAINS CLOSED VIGILS HAVE BEEN HELD IN BRUSSELS TO REMEMBER THE VICTIMS OF THE ATTACKS THE PRIME MINISTER CHARLES MICHEL LIT A CANDLE AT THE PLASTER LEBEAU HORSE A SQUARE WHERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAD GATHERED THESE PEOPLE EXPLAINED WHY THEY WANTED TO BE THERE I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST REALLY HURTFUL
EVERY PART OF ME IS ACHING FOR THE FAMILIES I'VE NEVER SEEN WHAT WE SOLD TODAY
I'M VERY STRUCK BY WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT'S WHY I FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO COME DOWN HERE AND TOGETHER WE THOUGHT OF OTHER PEOPLE IN BRUSSELS I THINK I'M HERE TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR ALL OF US WHO HAVE LOST TODAY
THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAS WARNED PEOPLE TRAVELLING TO BELGIUM TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND STAY AWAY FROM CROWDED PLACES IT SAYS TWO PEOPLE FROM BRITAIN WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACKS FAMILY AND FRIENDS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT DAVID DIXON A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER FROM NOTTINGHAM WHO'S BEEN MISSING SINCE SETTING OFF FOR WORK IN BRUSSELS YESTERDAY

THE FUTURE OF THE CLOTHING AND HOME GOODS CHAIN B.H.S. WILL BE DECIDED TODAY WHEN ITS CREDITORS VOTE ON WHETHER TO BACK A RESCUE DEAL WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT B.H.S. IS LIKELY TO GO INTO ADMINISTRATION PUTTING MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND JOBS AT RISK OUR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JONTY BLOOM REPORTS
UNTIL LAST YEAR B.H.S. WAS OWNED BY SIR PHILIP GREEN BUT AFTER YEARS OF LOSSES HE SOLD IT FOR JUST ONE POUND TO RETAIL ACQUISITIONS IT'S NOW SEEKING A COMPANY VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT WHICH MEANS SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF ITS CREDITORS HAVE TO VOTE IN FAVOUR OF A SCHEME TO PROTECT THE COMPANY WHILE HE TRIES TO TURN ITSELF AROUND AND IN PARTICULAR WE NEGOTIATE THE RENTS OF MANY OF ITS STORES WHICH CLAIMS ARE FAR TOO HIGH
BUT EVEN IF IT WINS APPROVAL FOR THIS C.V. EH THE COMPANY IS FAR FROM SAFE AND IT HAS A HUGE HOLE IN ITS PENSION FUND OF SOME FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS
AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW HAS CRITICISED THE WAY SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HANDLED INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALLEGATIONS THAT CHILDREN WERE SEXUALLY EXPLOITED IT BLAME SENIOR OFFICERS WERE BEING MORE INTERESTED IN INVESTIGATING CAR CRIME AND BURGLARY IT'S THE THIRD REPORTING TO HOW HUNDREDS OF YOUNG GIRLS WERE GROOMED AND SUBJECTED TO RAPES AND ASSAULT OVER HER SIXTEEN YEAR PERIOD BEFORE SAYS IT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN TACKLING CHILD ABUSE BUT IT ACCEPTS THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE IS A SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL BE CANNON
THIS INDEPENDENT REPORT CONDUCTED FOR THE EARLIEST POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONER LOOKED INTO WHY THE FORCEFIELD TO ACT PARTICULARLY IN RATHER ROTHERHAM BUT ALSO IN SHEFFIELD IT SAYS IS THAT FOR A DECADE FROM TWO THOUSAND SENIOR OFFICERS WEREN'T INTERESTED IN CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION SOMETIMES VIEWING IT AS A BIRD AND JUNIOR OFFICERS FOUNDED WELL NIGH IMPOSSIBLE SIR IS THAT A VIEW TO GET SUPPORT DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE THE FORCE PLACED ON CAR CRIME BURGLARY AND ROBBERY NATIONAL POLICING PRIORITIES AT THE TIME
TODAY'S REPORT SAYS THE FORCE HAS MARKEDLY IMPROVED ITS INVESTIGATION OF CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN BUT THE CHALLENGE IS INCREASING
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ARRIVED IN ARGENTINA ON THE CONCLUDING LEG OF HIS VISIT TO LATIN AMERICA THERE'S BEEN SOME CONTROVERSY OVER THE TIMING OF THE VISIT AS IT COINCIDES WITH THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF A MILITARY COUP WHICH WAS INITIALLY BACKED BY WASHINGTON

THANK YOU VERY MUCH PHILIP IT IS COMING UP TO EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX EIGHT MINUTES PAST SEVEN HERE IN BRUSSELS AND IN THE CENTRE OF BRUSSELS WHERE I AM AT THE PLACE STILL UP
THERE ARE STILL CANDLES BURNING WERE LATE YESTERDAY BY PEOPLE WHO CAME DOWN HERE TO COMMEMORATE THEIR VICTIMS OF YESTERDAY'S ATTACKS THIRTY FIVE IN ALL AT LEAST POSSIBLY THAT FIGURE WILL GO UP TODAY
AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO CAME DOWN HERE YESTERDAY TO THIS SITE WAS THE PRIME MINISTER WHO PAID HIS RESPECTS AS WELL AND SOME OF THE IMAGES THAT YOU SEE
BOTH HERE AT THE IN THE CENTRE OF BRUSSELS WITH THOSE CANDLES BUT ALSO AROUND THE CITY OF COURSE ARE DOMINATING THE PAPERS IN
THIS MORNING THERE IS ONLY ONE STORY IN LA VENIR FOR INSTANCE THERE'S AN EDITORIAL IN WHICH THE PAPER TELLS ITS READERS THAT STRENGTH IS IN UNITY IN THAT ONLY UNITY CAN FACE UP TO ADVERSITY WE MUSTN'T SAYS THE PAPER LET GO OF A FUNDAMENTAL VALUES THAT ARE THE CORNERSTONE OF DEMOCRACY IS PEACE FREEDOM FOR ETERNITY AND SOLIDARITY
IN ANOTHER OF THE BELGIAN PAPERS SUED PRESS SAYS THAT BELGIUM IS HIT BUT STILL STANDING THIS DAY THAT OF ODIOUS AND COWARDLY ATTACKS IS A WATERSHED MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY THE POPE
LE SOIR CARRIES A PHOTOGRAPH OF PEOPLE GATHERED WHERE I AM AT THE MOMENT IN THE PLACE TO LA HORSE WRITING MESSAGES OF SOLIDARITY IN CHALK ON THE PAVEMENT THAT'S SOMETHING WILL TURN TO LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME AS WELL IN THE FRONT PAGE OF LE SOIR ON AN EDITORIAL THEY SAY THERE IS A SENSE THAT TUESDAY IN BRUSSELS WAS NOT THE END OF SOMETHING BUT THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING THE START OF
DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFE OF A SOCIETY THAT'S MORE CLOSED OFF ONE THAT HE'S LESS CAREFREE AND PERHAPS AND THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD FEAR THE PAPER SAYS MORE HATE
JUST FINALLY SEVERAL COLUMNISTS ALSO QUESTION WHAT CAN BE DONE TO TACKLE WHAT THEY CALL PHANTOM TERRORISTS LE SOIR WRITES THAT CARNAGE REMINDS US PAINFULLY THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM WILL NEVER BE OVER BUT THAT TO STAND UP TO THESE COMBATANTS OF THE APOCALYPSE AS THE PAPER CALLS THEM DEMOCRACIES MUST BETTER ORGANISED THEMSELVES AND EVEN ARMED THEMSELVES BETTER TO PROTECT THEIR POPULATIONS
AND IT IS OF COURSE THE STORY THAT IS ALL OVER THE FRONT PAGES AND ALMOST ALL THE INSIDE PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPERS THIS MORNING THE INDEPENDENT IT'S ALMOST IT'S A BLACK AND WHITE COVER VIRTUALLY AN IMAGE OF THOSE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THE TUBE YESTERDAY DARKNESS IN THE HEART OF EUROPE OTHER THE WORDS ACROSS THE TOP ON THE FRONT PAGE OTHERWISE THE IMAGES PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY ON MANY OF THE FRONT PAGES OF THAT PHOTOGRAPH
OF THE BOMBERS THE JIHADI BRUSSELS AIRPORT TWO IN BLACK WEARING GLOVES WHICH A LOT OF THE PAPERS HAVE CIRCLE BECAUSE THOSE GLOVES ON ONE HAND THOUGHT TO BE HIDING DETONATION SWITCHES AND OF COURSE THE THIRD MAN WITH THEM WHO'S THOUGHT TO HAVE ESCAPED AND BE ON THE RUN BLOOD BATH IN BRUSSELS IS A PHRASE THAT IS
USED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE DEATH SQUAD TO DESCRIBE THEM IN THE GUARDIAN WELL ALL THE PAPERS LOOK AT THE SORT OF THE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS THAT BRUSSELS FACES AS I HAVE AND IT'S A LONG HISTORY AS A HAVEN FOR MILITANTS TO USE THE WORDS IN THE GUARDIAN IS LISTED SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME FROM THE CITY AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ATTACKS AROUND THE WORLD BUT ALSO OF COURSE THEY LOOK AT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A TOUCH AND ATTACK HERE
AND THE GUARDIAN ARE YOU AND MACARTHUR'S RIGHT IN THE AGENCIES HERE SAY THEY STOP SEVEN PLOTS LAST YEAR BUT THEY REPEATEDLY STRESS THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEIR LUCK AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES GOING TO HOLD FOR EVER THE THREAT LEVEL HERE SEVERE WHICH MEANS OF COURSE AN ATTACK IS DESIGNATED AS HIGHLY LIKELY AND IT SOUNDS ALARMING BUT THEY'D NEED SOME SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT AN ATTACK TO RAZE IT TO THE NEXT HIGHEST CATEGORY WHICH IS CRITICAL AND HE SPELLS OUT AN ARTICLE IN THE GOD IN THE DIFFICULTIES WHITE'S LESS LIKELY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE
AN ATTACK NOT SAY THAT IT ISN'T IT'S POSSIBLE EVEN PROBABLE IT'S JUST THAT IT'S HARDER TO GET WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION HERE THAN IN BELGIAN EASIER YOU CAN MAKE A BOND THAT THAT NEEDS EXPERTISE AND AS SOON AS YOU STOP PRACTISING YOU DRAW ATTENTION TO YOURSELF AND ALSO THE THERE SEEMS TO BE A SHIFT IN ISLAMIC TERRORISM THE HEART OF GLOBAL JIHAD HAD BEEN IN SOUTHERN ASIA WHICH OF COURSE HAS CLOSE CONNECTIONS TO THE U.K. BUT NOW THAT IT'S SHIFTED TO THE LEVANTE THE CONNECTIONS WITH ARAB COMMUNITIES IN CONTINENTAL
IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX WELL AS MATTHEW WAS SAYING THERE IS HAS BEEN A VIGIL FOR THE VICTIMS IN BRUSSELS LAST NIGHT AND AT THAT VIGIL IN THE PLACE DE LA BAW SWEAR MATTHEW IS THE BELGIAN INTERIOR MINISTER YOUNG AM BONN SPOKE TO REPORTERS AND SAID THE TERRACE COULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO WIN
HE SAID THE BELGIUM HAD BEEN IN A STATE OF HIGH ALERT BECAUSE IT HAD ANTICIPATED AND ATTACK SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY HE ALSO SAID THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A LINK BETWEEN THE BOMBINGS AND FRIDAY'S ARREST OF SULLA ABDUS SALAM US A SUSPECT IN THE PARIS ATTACKS IN NOVEMBER TO CHANCE WAS BY FROM
BRUSSELS HAS MADE INCREDIBLE TRUE QUICK ANSWER THINGS HAVE GONE THERE
MAKES YOU WANT TO BE ON THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR HOODS PROMISED TO WORK WITH THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT TO HELP CATCH THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ATTACKS LAST NIGHT ANGLER MUKKA SAID THE ATTACKERS WITH THE ENEMIES OF ALL WHO UPHOLD THE EUROPEAN VALUES OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY AND SAID OUR STRENGTH COMES FROM OUR UNITY AND WILL TURN OUT TO BE STRONGER THAN TERRORISM ON HIS VISIT TO CUBA PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TO REPORTERS AT A BASEBALL GAME AND MADE A SIMILAR COMMITMENT SAYING COUNTRIES NEEDED TO WORK TOGETHER TO DEFEAT TERRORISM I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO
THERE'S JUST ONE MORE
A WALL THERE'S TO UNITE AGAINST THESE TERRORISTS THE NOTION THERE ANY POLITICAL AGENDA WOULD JUST BUY THEM
SOMETHING THAT'S BEYOND THE PALE WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE WOULD BE OVER SIXTY NATIONS GOING POUNDING
MEANTIME I WAS HERE I'VE GOT AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LOST AND HOPING FOR A SPEEDY RECOVERY FOR THOSE
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA TALKING IN CUBA ABOUT THE ATTACKS HERE IN BRUSSELS IT IS LIGHT IT'S DRIZZLING AS WELL BUT THE DRIZZLE ISN'T PUTTING OUT THE CANDLES THAT THE SMALL COMMEMORATION THAT SPONTANEOUSLY
GREW UP HERE IN THE CENTRE OF BRUSSELS JUST NEXT TO THE MAGNIFICENT BUILDING BUILT IN THE EARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS IT WAS AT THIS TIME YESTERDAY WITH THE THREE MEN THE BELGIAN PROSECUTOR BELIEVES CARRIED OUT THE ATTACKS ITSELF INTO MY AIRPORT ONE OF WHOM IS ON THE RUN WE'RE GETTING READY TO SET OFF ON THEIR MURDEROUS MISSION A REPORTER GAVIN LEE HE'S AT THE AIRPORT WHERE TWO OF THEM BLEW THEMSELVES UP GAVIN IS THE AIRPORT RE OPENING TODAY
NO ABSOLUTELY NO SIGN OF THAT NOTHING I'VE BEEN HERE FOLLOWING THIS ON THE GROUND FOR THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE DIFFERENCE THIS MORNING
AROUND THREE HUNDRED METRES AWAY HAS BEEN NEARLY AS SHORT AND THEY'RE ALLOWING
CERTAINLY PEOPLE CLOSER TO THE AIRPORT THEY'RE ALSO ALLOWING PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL BADGES WHO HAVE GOT SOME POTS ON LUGGAGE TO PICK UP CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT AS WELL AND THE AMOUNT OF THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTIGATION TEAMS NOW MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH TO THE RUINS OF THE ATRIUM BUILDING WHERE THE CEILING COLLAPSE IT'S IN THE TERMINUS AT THE MOMENT MATTHEW IN TERMS OF
HOW LONG THE AIRPORT WILL BE CLOSE FOR THERE'S AN EMERGENCY CABINET MEETING WITH THE BOAT AND GOVERNMENTS THIS MORNING TO ESTABLISH IT WHAT DO THEY NEED TO HAVE MORE SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE BUT THAT ACTUALLY IN THE SITUATION IS
HE'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PRIORITY LIST GIVEN AS YOU MENTION THIS PHOTOFIT OF THE MISSING SUSPECT SAID TO BE THE THIRD BOMBER AT THE AT THE AIRPORT REPORTS IN THE BOAT AND MEDIA HERE THIS MORNING IS THAT A TAXI DRIVER WHO DROPPED THE THREE MEN UP AT THE AIRPORT SAID HE WAS SUSPICIOUS WHEN THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T WANT HELP WITH THE BAGGAGE HE LED THE POLICE BACK LAST NIGHT WHEN ADDRESSING SCAR BACK REPEAT CONFIRM THEY RAIDED AND ADDRESS AND THIS AREA OF SCAR WHICH IS
WHERE UP LAST THURSDAY BEFORE SOLD ABDUS SALAM WAS FOUND THEIR BROTHER HAVE BROUGHT HIM UP THE SUICIDE BOMB AT THE PARIS ATTACKS HAD A FUNERAL AND MANY PEOPLE
WERE RECORDED BY THE POLICE ON THAT I'M NOT THAT ON THAT FOOTAGE AND THEY MANAGED TO ARREST BACK ON FRIDAY ANOTHER MAN AT THE SAME HOUSE OR SOLID SLABS OF THESE ARE THE TWO AREAS THE POLICE ARE FOCUSING ON BOTH AND BAKE WE'RE SOLD OUT OF THE SLAMMER SPELL AND SGEILE BAKE THIS AREA RIGHT NEXT TO IT
AND SO BRIEFLY THAT THEY'RE BUILDING UP A PICTURE BUT STILL ONE MAN ON THE RUN VERY BRIEFLY
WHAT WOMAN OTHER RUN SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THIS MORNING HAVE THIS CLAIMS MORE CREDENCE FOR THE ATTACK SAYING THAT THERE HAD BEEN PLANNING THIS FOR A WHILE THEY'VE BROUGHT THE ATTACKS FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE CAPTURE OF SOLAR AT THE SLAMMER BUT HE MIGHT TALK IN THIS MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON IN BRUGES AND THAT THEY ARE PLANNING MORE ATTACKS TO FOLLOW
GAVIN LEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND IT IS A CRUCIAL DAY FOR THE FUTURE OF ONE OF THE U.K.'S BIGGEST HIGH STREET NAMES ADAM PARSONS IS HERE WITH MORE ON THAT AT THAT SO THIS IS THE B.H.S. A FIXTURE IN MANY TOWN CENTRES FOR ALMOST NINETY YEARS BUT ITS VERY EXISTENCE IS UNDER THREAT THE DEPARTMENT CHAINS CREDITORS ARE MEETING TODAY TO CONSIDER A PROPOSAL TO CUT RENTS OR MORE THAN HALF
OF ITS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR STORES B.H.S. HAS WARNED THAT IF THE COMPANY VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT OR C.V.A. ISN'T AGREED HE COULD GO INTO ADMINISTRATION PUTTING UP TO TEN THOUSAND JOBS AT RISK OR DAVID FOX'S HEAD OF RETAIL AGENCY NORTH AT THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FIRM COLLIE IS INTERNATIONAL AND OUR LOT CARD IS THE PROPERTY DIRECTOR AT NEW RIVER RETAIL A PROPERTY COMPANY THAT OWNS THREE B.H.S. UNITS
ALAN IS ONE OF THE LAND WAS BEING ASKED TO CUT B.H.S. HIS RENT BILL GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU DAVID IF IF WE START WITH YOU HOW DID B.H.S. GET INTO THIS MESS I THINK OVER THE YEARS IT HAS JUST WOULD HAVE LOST THEIR WAY AS A RETAILER THERE HAVE BEEN THE DISCOUNTERS CAME ON STREAM THAT OTHER RETAILERS SUCH AS DEBENHAMS AND NEXT OCCUPIED THE SPACE THAT WE PREVIOUSLY HEARD AND FRANKLY THEY JUST THE BRITISH SHOPPER JUST FELL OUT OF LOVE WITH THEM THEY AT CORE AUDIENCE THAT ACTUALLY
THEY ALWAYS ATTRACTED IN THE IN THE EARLIER DAYS DISTANT SHOP THERE ANY MORE AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONES SPENDING MONEY IT'S THE YOUNGER SHOPPER AND THEY DO NOT ATTRACT THE YOUNGER SHOPPER A C.V.A. IS A FORM OF OF INSOLVENCY AGREEMENT WHAT WOULD THIS ACTUALLY MEAN FOR B.H.S. WELL AWAY AT IT MEANS THAT THEY CAN
FIT DROPPED A FIXED COURSE OSTENSIBLY IT'S RENT WHICH IS A BIGGER SINGLE COST OF ANY RETAILER FOR THEM IT DOES MEAN SOME FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THEIR PORTFOLIO SO AS YOU SAID THE CAN DROP ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE PORTFOLIO AND SOME OF THOSE AS THE C.V. OR SUCCESSFUL THEY MAY START DROPPING STALLS ALMOST STRAIGHT AWAY BUT THERE IS A CORE BUSINESS AND THAT CORE BUSINESS SEEMS TO BE PROFITABLE AND THERE ARE SOME MAJOR STORES INCLUDE THAT IN THE CATEGORY ONE OF THE C.V.A. AND IF HE CAN HOLD ON TO THOSE THEY ALSO THINK WE'VE GOT A FUTURE
BUT I THINK THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE TO THIS WHICH IS THEIR SUPPLIERS WHO OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE BUSINESS WILL CAN PROSPER AND ACTUALLY PAY THAT PAY THE BUILT WELL LET'S TALK TO ONE OF THOSE LAND OZ'S WHO'S BEING ASKED TO BEAR THE COST OF CUTTING RENTS UNLOCKED CARTER HOW ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE ALAN WHEN IT COMES TO THE MEETING TODAY I COULD MORNING ADAM WE'RE GOING TO BE VOTING IN FAVOUR OF THE TERMS OF THE SEA
SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT A RENT CUP WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT WELL I MEAN FIRST OF ALL I MEAN AS A BUSINESS WE HAVE AN ANNUAL RENT ROLL NINETEEN MILLION SO THE IMPACT OF THE C.V. ARRAN REPRESENTS LESS THAN POINT THREE PER CENT OF OUR ANNUAL RENT SO FINANCIALLY IT'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AT ALL THE C.V.A. HE'S NOT COME AS A SHOCK TO YOU
NEW RIVER HOUR OR INDEED TO THE MARKET PLACE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR SOME TIME AND PART OF THE TIMES OF THE C.V.A. HE'S OBVIOUSLY WENT REDUCTIONS BUT ALSO WHAT B.H.S. ARE OFFERING IS FOR LANDLORDS FOR THOSE PROPERTIES ARE SUBJECT TO A RENT REDUCTION THEY'RE OFFERING A BREAK CLAUSE SO IN OTHER WORDS IF A LANDLORD BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE A MORE VIABLE
OPTION FOR THE FUTURE THEN THEY CAN TAKE POSSESSION BACK FROM B.H.S. AND RE LET THAT SPACE TO ALTERNATIVE RETAILER SO ALAN JUST TRANSLATING AT DOES THAT MEAN THAT IN SIX MONTHS' TIME IF YOU AGREED TO THIS DEAL AND PRIMARK COME ALONG WITH A BETTER OFFER YOU COULD CHOP B.H.S. AREN'T THAT'S CLEARLY GOING TO BE AN OPTION
IT DOESN'T SET A PRECEDENT FOR YOUR OTHER TENANTS FROM THE SHOPS TO TRY AND COME BACK TO YOU TO REDUCE THE RENT
AND THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF C.V.A. AS IN THE PAST AND WE NEVER EXPERIENCED RETAILERS THEN SAYING WHAT HAS BEEN A RENT REDUCTION FOR RETAILER X. AND THEREFORE WE WE ALSO WANT A RENT REDUCTION AND C. V. EIGHT IS THERE ART
BEEN A NUMBER OF RETAILERS OR WENT INTO C.V.A. IS THERE ULTIMATELY THEN WENT INTO FOR ADMINISTRATION BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCCESS STORIES AND YOU'RE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS TRAVEL LAUNCHED WHO WENT INTO C. V. TWENTY TWELVE AND NOW THAT BUSINESS FOLLOWING ITS RESTRUCTURE IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
AND DAVID FOX INTERESTED HERE ALAN'S GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOUR OF THIS ARE YOU EXPECTING US TO GO THROUGH I THINK IT WELL AS ALAN SAYS IT DOES OFFER FOR ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF LANDLORDS OPTIONS TO ACTUALLY REALISE PROPER VALUE FROM THE STORY'S A BIT FURTHER DOWN THE LINE AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR OTHER RETAILERS WITH SOME OF THE STORES WILL ACTUALLY BE RE DESIGNATED FOR A LEISURE SPACE ESTIMATE MIGHT BE REDEVELOPED FOR CINEMAS WITH IN SHOPPING CENTRES
AND ALTERNATIVE USES SUCH AS JIM SPACE ULTIMATELY THE GROAN FLOORS THE MOST VALUABLE PART BUT FINDING OCCUPIERS FOR THE REST OF THE STORAGE COULD BE THE BIGGEST PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT MEETING IS HAPPENING TODAY WILL TELL YOU HOW IT PANS OUT THE BUSINESS USED TO WORK FOR THE MOMENT MONEY THANKS A LOT CUT AND DAVID FOX
MARK IT'S GUEST THIS MORNING IS DOMINIC ROSSI CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER FROM FIDELITY INVESTMENTS DOMINIC A LOT GOING ON LET'S KICK OFF WITH ENERGY E.D.F. THE FRENCH ECONOMY MINISTER HAS SAID E.D.F. WILL MAKE HER FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION ON THE HINKLEY POINT NUCLEAR REACTOR BUT NOT UNTIL MAY THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME HASN'T IT YES I MEAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED IN THE EARLY PART OF LAST YEAR
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN I THINK WHAT IS IT WE'RE NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE I THINK THIS DECISION IS
AS MUCH ABOUT POLITICAL EXPEDIENT AS IT IS A BUSINESS DECISION AND OBVIOUSLY E.D.F. MANAGEMENT HAVE GOT TO PRESENT THEMSELVES TO PARLIAMENT
THIS WEEK AND I THINK SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS WHICH STILL SEEM TO BE AN OUNCE IT IS THE FACT THAT THE END OF THE U.K. CONSUMER IS GOING TO BE LOCKED INTO ELECTRICITY PRICES TWICE THE MARKET COUNTS RATE FOR THE NEXT THIRTY FIVE YEARS
IT'S NOT OBVIOUS THAT E.D.F. THEMSELVES HAVE THEIR BALANCE SHEET TO BUILD THIS PLANT AND IN ADDITION TO THAT OBVIOUSLY E.D.F. LOST THEIR OWN FINANCE DIRECTOR
A FEW MONTHS AGO POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THIS THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT SO THEY'RE A LOT OF AUNTS AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS WHICH
WHICH I THINK PARLIAMENT NEEDS TO ADDRESS YES VERY PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THIS PROTEST HIS DEPARTURE TALKING OF THE WORLD OF ENERGY DOMINIC OIL PRICES UP FIFTY PERCENT OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS IF YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING AT THE TURN OF THE YEAR WE MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE OIL INDUSTRY BUT IS IT PANIC OVER NOW DO YOU THINK WELL IT CERTAINLY HAS IT HAS RALLIED BUT
IN THE MID FORTIES IT'S STILL A LONG WAY FROM FROM WHERE IT WAS TWELVE MONTHS AGO ALL ALL ALL ALONE TWIT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AGO WHAT SEEMS TO BE STABILISING THE THE OIL PRICE ARE TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECOUNT
STEP BACK DOWN BELOW WHERE IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE SO WE REALLY HAVE SEEN A SUPPLY CRUNCH AND SECONDLY THERE IS DISCUSSIONS AMONGST OPEC AND NON OPEC MEMBERS AROUND A PRODUCTION FREEZE THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S GOING TO INCLUDE IRAN WHICH I THINK IS THE WILD CARD IN THE SUPPLY EQUATION BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME MORE DISCIPLINE AT LEAST FROM SOME PRODUCERS
AND A QUICK THOUGHT OF SPORTS DIRECT SHARES DOWN TEN PER CENT YESTERDAY AFTER THE BOSS MIKE ACTUALLY SAID THE COMPANY WAS IN TROUBLE HE SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE REALLY SHOULDN'T HE RATHER THAN TO A NEWSPAPER HE SHOULD HAVE DONE I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OR EVEN A VICE CHAIRMAN AND YOU ANNOUNCING AT A TRADING UPDATE THERE ARE FORMALITIES WHICH ARE MEANT TO BE FOLLOWED NOT LISA TRADING STATEMENT THROUGH THE STOCK EXCHANGE
MIKE ASHLEY CHOSE TO DO IT THROUGH AN INTERVIEW WITH THE TIMES NOT QUITE WHAT WHAT THE MARKET EXPECTS WHETHER OR NOT THE THE STOCK EXCHANGE OR THE F.C.A. WILL INVESTIGATE THIS IS ANOTHER MATTER OF COURSE THE F.C.A. THEMSELVES OWN RECORD WE'RE ABOUT LEAKING PRICE SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO NEWSPAPERS RATHER THAN DO THE PROPER CHANNELS ITSELF
HAS BEEN ANYTHING THE PATH NOT ENTIRELY BLEMISH FREE OR DOMINIC SO WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS AS WELL BECAUSE GOING TO ABOUT CENTRAL BANKERS THEY'VE BEEN THROWING EVERYTHING AT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN THE YEARS SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THE PAST FEW MONTHS THEY'VE BEEN CALLED INTO RENEWED ACTION WE HAD THOSE OIL PRICES CONCERNS OVER CHINA STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY AND CENTRAL BANKERS CUTTING RATES SO LOW THEY HAVE GONE NEGATIVE HUNGARY CENTRAL BANK THE LATEST TO DO SO YESTERDAY JOINING THE LIKES OF SWITZERLAND JAPAN INTAE YOUR PEN CENTRAL BANK
CENTRAL BANKERS HAVE ALSO BEEN BOOSTING QUANTITATIVE EASING THEY'VE EVEN BEEN PAYING BANKS TO LEND MONEY NONE OF IT SO FAR AT LEAST SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN HAVING THE DESIRED EFFECT MOUNTING CONCERNS ARE NOT QUITE AS POWERFUL AS WE THOUGHT WERE RANDY CROSSNESS WHERE THIS FORMER U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR AND A PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO BOTH SCHOOL OF BUSINESS ROUND
HAVE CENTRAL BANKING HAS BEEN EXPOSED AS NOT QUITE AS POWERFUL AS WE THOUGHT THEY WERE WELL SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE ALL POWERFUL I THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF MYTHOLOGY THERE DEVELOPED AROUND CENTRAL BANKS THAT THEY COULD DO ANYTHING THAT THEY WANTED IT'S NEVER BEEN THE CASE THEY PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FOUNDATION FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE FISCAL POLICY APPROPRIATE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE STRUCTURAL PASSES RIGHT THINKING ABOUT REGULATION COMPETITION ENTREPRENEURSHIP
CENTRAL BANKS CAN PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION BY TRYING TO AVOID DEFLATION BUT IT'S THESE OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE GOING TO GET PEOPLE TO INVEST TO HIRE AND FOR THE ECONOMY TO GROW IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY OVERTIME I WE ALSO VERY TRIGGER HAPPY AT THE MOMENT MARIO DRUGGIES COMMENTS IT SOMETIMES THE BOSS OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK WHAT HE SAYS SOMETIMES SEEMS TO HAVE A GREATER IMPACT THAN WHAT HE ACTUALLY DOES
THE PRODUCERS AND SELLS A SECURITY IS KNOWN AS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS AND SOMETIMES I JOKE THAT OPEN MOUTH OPERATIONS THAT IS CENTRAL BANKERS TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO CAN BE MORE POWERFUL THEN THE ACTUAL PRODUCERS AND SELLS A SECURITIES I THINK WE SAW THIS QUITE POWERFULLY WITH THE MOST RECENT HE B. ANNOUNCEMENT THE BAZOOKA IS THE TRIGGER IS PULLED AND MUCH BIGGER
OUR POLICY THAN HAD BEEN EXPECTED IMMEDIATE IMPACT IS FOR INTEREST RATES TO FOUR VERY STRONGLY FOR THE ORDER FOR VERY STRONGLY AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE MARRIED RUGGED ENTERED ONE MAYBE THESE THERE WOULD BE LIMITS TO DRIVING INTEREST RATES DOWN IT WAS INTERPRETED AS THEY MAY BE NOT WILLING TO DICK GO FURTHER INTEREST RATE SPIKED UP THE EURO SPIKED UP
THE WORDS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE DEEDS WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK AROUND YOU ON THE STATE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN THE COMING TWELVE MONTHS I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD THE U.S. SEEMS TO BE MOVING ALONG AT A MODEST TO MODERATE PIECE OF GROWTH OF AROUND TWO PER CENT OBVIOUSLY CHINA HAS SLOWED
MANY OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE BARELY ACHIEVING GROWTH AND EMERGING MARKETS ARE A QUITE CHOPPY SO I THINK IT'S A VERY MIXED BAG AROUND THE WORLD AND I THINK MANY CENTRAL BANKS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. ARE GOING TO BE DOING EVEN MORE SUPPORT FOR HER TRYING TO GET THE ECONOMY'S GOING AND TO AVOID DEFLATION RANDI CROSS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BE REFLECTING FURTHER ON GLOBAL INSTABILITY IN AN HOUR'S TIME TALKING TO THE CHAIRMAN OF LLOYD'S OF LONDON
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ROB'S HERE WITH THE SPORT GOOD MORNING ROB YES COME ON MATTHEW ON THE EVENTS IN BRUSSELS HAVE BROUGHT SECURITY AT EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN LATER THIS YEAR IN FRANCE TO THE CENTRE OF FOOTBALL'S AGENDA FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER BURN OUR COUSIN NERVE SAID THAT SECURITY FOR THE TOURNAMENT WAS ALREADY AT ITS MAXIMUM
ADDING WE CANNOT PERMANENTLY RAISE WHAT IS ALREADY A HIGH VERY HIGH LEVEL SINCE JANUARY TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE MEASURES HERE MEANWHILE OTHER THOUGHTS OF WALES MANAGER CHRIS COLEMAN EVERYBODY FEELS A LITTLE BIT UNSAFE ESPECIALLY GOING INTO A HUGE TOURNAMENT LIKE WE ARE WE'RE TOLD THAT'S GOING TO BE A TARGET
WE SHOULDN'T GIVE IN TO THESE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NEVER GIVING THEM A LOBBY SHOULD DICTATE THE WORSE IN A WAY ON WHERE WE CAN GO I THINK THESE PEOPLE ARE OUR MUST STAY IN
AND HOUSES LOCKED UP TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THROUGH LET THEM HAVE THEIR WAY IN THAT SHOULDN'T
NUMBER ONE TENNIS PLAYER NOVAK DJOKOVIC HAS ISSUED AN APOLOGETIC CLARIFICATION OF HIS REMARKS THAT FOLLOW THE ROW EARLIER THIS WEEK ABOUT THE PARITY OF THE WOMEN'S GAME WITH THE MEN'S HE'D SAID THAT MEN SHOULD FIGHT FOR MORE MONEY THAN THE PRIZES RECEIVED BY WOMEN BECAUSE THEIR MEN ATTRACT MORE VIEWERS BUT NOW VIA SOCIAL MEDIA HE'S SAYING THAT THE FAIR AND BETTER DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS SHOULD APPLY TO BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND THIS CLEARLY CHIMES WITH THE VIEW OF BRITAIN'S ANDY MURRAY
IT'S NOT ABOUT MEN A WORM BUT TURNER SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR THE PLAYERS THAT WE HAVE AROUND

THE FUTURE OF ONE OF THE U.K.'S BEST KNOWN HIGH STREET NAMES B.H.S. WILL BE DECIDED TODAY WHEN ITS CREDITORS A VOTE ON WHETHER TO BACK A RESCUE DEAL WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT THE COMPANY WHICH HAS BEEN MAKING A LOSS FOR SEVERAL YEARS MAY GO INTO ADMINISTRATION BUILDING MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND JOBS AT RISK
THE FRONT RUNNERS IN THE GRACES FOR THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE WON THEIR PARTIES PRIMARIES IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA PROJECTIONS SAY BERNIE SANDERS HAS WON THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUSES IN UTAH
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ARRIVED IN ARGENTINA ON THE CONCLUDING LEG OF HIS VISIT TO LATIN AMERICA THERE'S BEEN SOME CONTROVERSY OVER THE TIMING OF THE VISIT AS IT COINCIDES WITH THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF A MILITARY COUP WHICH WAS INITIALLY BACKED BY WASHINGTON
CONSERVATIONISTS SAY THEY FOUND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY PLASTIC BOTTLES FOR EVERY MILE OF BRITISH COASTLINE THEY'RE VOLUNTEERS CLEANED LAST YEAR THE MARINE CONSERVATION SOCIETY SAID THE NUMBER PICKED UP DURING ITS GREAT BRITISH BEACH CLEANUP IN SEPTEMBER HAD RISEN BY FORTY THREE PERCENT COMPARED WITH THE YEAR BEFORE SCIENTISTS FEAR THE ASH TREE WILL BE WIPED OUT IN EUROPE THEY SAY THE ASHES UNDER THREAT FROM A FUNGAL DISEASE AND ATTACKS BY THE EMERALD ASH BORA BEETLE WHICH HASN'T YET REACHED THE U.K.
NEIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S COMING UP TO TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO SEVEN HERE IN THE CENTRE OF BRUSSELS THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GATHERED CONTEMPLATING THE SCENE OUTSIDE THE CITIES BAW SWEAR CANDLES HAVE BEEN LATE AND PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN MESSAGES OF COMMEMORATION IN CHALK ON THE PAVING STONES
CHRIS MORRIS IS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT WHO'S IN A BUREAU IN THE CITY AND CHRIS OVERNIGHT OFFICIALS RELEASED THE FIRST NAME OF ONE OF THOSE TO HAVE DIED
YES AND SADLY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MANY MORE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF TRAUMA A LOT OF UPSET IN THIS CITY BUT FOR THE SECURITY SERVICES AND OFFICIALDOM
THEY'RE MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK HENCE THE APPEAL FOR ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE THREE MEN CAPTURED ON A STILL PHOTOGRAPH IN THE SECURITY
TWO MEN DRESSED IN BLACK WHO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE BLOWN THEMSELVES UP AS SUICIDE BOMBERS AT THE AIRPORT AND A THIRD MAN ACTIVELY WANTED NOW
WEARING A WHITE JACKET AND A BLACK HAT WHO IS BELIEVED TO HAVE FLED FROM THE SEA
AND MAY WELL HAVE BEEN CARRYING ON HIS LUGGAGE TROLLEY THE BOMB THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY
DIDN'T EXPLODE WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE IT WOULD APPEAR ACCORDING TO THE POLICE WEBSITE THAT THEY ARE UNKNOWN TO THE AUTHORITIES AND THAT AGAIN IS A CAUSE FOR CONCERN SUGGESTING THERE COULD BE YET ANOTHER RING OF PEOPLE A NETWORK OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE FALLEN BELOW THE RADAR OF THE SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
AND AGAIN RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT QUITE HOW WELL OR OTHERWISE BELGIAN INTELLIGENCE IS HANDLING THIS SITUATION
YEAH IT'S IT'S PLAYING CATCH UP AND IT'S HAVING TO DO IT VERY QUICKLY SINCE THE ATTACKS IN PARIS IN NOVEMBER THE BELGIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE APPROVED ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION EUROS OF NEW FUNDING TO UPGRADE SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE
THIS ATTACK SUGGEST IT'S NOT ENOUGH YET THERE HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED ISSUES OF DIFFERENT LAYERS OF POLITICAL MANAGEMENT NEARLY TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT LOCAL POLICE FORCES AROUND THE COUNTRY SIX DIFFERENT PARLIAMENT'S PASSING DIFFERENT KINDS OF LAWS
THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM AND IN A COUNTRY WITH A POPULATION NOT MUCH SMALLER THAN THE NEIGHBOURING NETHERLANDS THE SYSTEM IS THERE'S MUCH MORE DIFFUSE MUCH LESS CENTRALISED AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY TRY AND DEAL WITH THE SENSITIVE SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ISSUES IS FAR SMALLER SO BELGIUM HAS EMERGED AS A SOFT UNDERBELLY AT THE MOMENT AND IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IS GOING TO BE A FOCUS ON NATIONAL MOURNING ON
IDENTIFYING THE DEAD ON HELPING THE WOUNDED BUT BEHIND THE SCENES OF COURSE THE AUTHORITIES ARE SCRAMBLING TO WORK OUT WHO MAY STILL BE OUT THERE
WHAT THE IMMINENT THREAT AND IT'S NOTABLE I THINK WE'VE HAD A STATEMENT OVERNIGHT FROM THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT WARNING U.S. CITIZENS OF THE POTENTIAL TERRORIST ATTACKS RIGHT THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND WARNING THEM TO AVOID PUBLIC PLACES PRETTY MUCH ACROSS THE COUNTRY
INDEED CHRIS AND WILL BE TALKING A LOT MORE ABOUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME OF COURSE CHRIS MORRIS THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S NOT TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN WILL WHAT ABOUT THE RESPONSE HERE NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR AND NORMAN THERE'S ANOTHER MEETING OF THE COBRA EMERGENCY COMMITTEE TODAY AFTER YESTERDAY
THIS WILL BE CHAIRED BY THE PRIME MINISTER LATER THIS MORNING AFTER WHICH I WOULD EXPECT WE MAY GET FURTHER DETAILS ON POTENTIAL BRITISH CASUALTIES AT THE MOMENT THE WORD IS THERE ARE TWO INJURED MY SENSES THEY ARE NOT AT THE CRITICAL END OF INJURIES IN TERMS OF THIS MISSING BRITON DAVID DIXON WHO WAS
APPARENTLY TRAVELLING ON THE METRO TO AROUND THE TIME OF THE METRO BOMBING AND HASN'T BEEN HEARD OF SINCE NUMBER TEN THIS MORNING SAY THEY HAVE NO FURTHER DETAILS ON HIM BUT WE MIGHT GET SOME FRESH INFORMATION AFTER THE COBRA MEETING MORE BROADLY THE VIEW OF THE HOME SECRETARY HAS BEEN THAT WE NEED TO BE ALERT BUT NOT ALARMED THERE IS NO DIRECT CONNECTION IT APPEARS BETWEEN THE
ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS AND END ANY IMMINENT THREAT IN BRITAIN ALTHOUGH A TEAM OF SPECIALIST BRITISH POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN SENT TO BRUSSELS TO ASSIST IN THE ENQUIRIES
IN TERMS OF PRECAUTIONS HERE THERE WILL BE A NOTICEABLE STEPPING UP IN TERMS OF THE POLICE PRESENCE AT MAJOR TRANSPORT HUBS
AT PORTS OF ENTRY THERE WILL BE MORE BORDER FORCE OFFICERS YOU CAN EXPECT MORE CHECKS OF CARS MORE SNIFFER DOGS AN AWFUL LOT MORE DELAYS AND I SUPPOSE INCONVENIENCE BUT IN OVERALL TERMS MY SENSES THE CONSENSUS IS WE ARE
POTENTIALLY ACTUALLY IN A RATHER BETTER POSITION PERHAPS AND THE AUTHORITIES IN BELGIUM BECAUSE WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AT THE SEVEN SEVEN BOMBING WHICH LED TO SOME REVAMPING OF HOW WE GATHER INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTER THE SORT OF TERRORISM WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TIGHTER RULES MUCH MORE STRINGENT RULES WHEN IT COMES TO FIREARMS GETTING INTO THE COUNTRY
AND I SUPPOSE ABOVE ALL BLUNTLY WE HAVE THE CHANNEL WHICH IS A VERY PHYSICAL BARRIER WHICH LIMITS THE ABILITY TO TRANSFER WEAPONS AND TERRORISTS NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME'S NOW TWENTY MINUTES TO SEVEN IN OTHER NEWS THE POLICE ARE OFTEN GETTING IT WRONG IN THE WAY THEY DEAL WITH MISSING CHILDREN AT LEAST SO SAYS HER MAJESTY'S INSPECTORATE OF CONSTABULARY DANNY SHAW IS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT AND DANNY IN WHAT WAY ARE THEY GETTING IT
IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS SARAH THIS IS A PRETTY DISMAL REPORT FROM INSPECTORATE OF CONSTABULARY IT SAYS SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN GO MISSING IN ENGLAND AND WALES AT LEAST ONCE EVERY YEAR THAT'S ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE REPORTS MISSING CHILDREN EACH DAY AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME POCKETS OF GOOD PRACTICE AMONG POLICE
THERE ARE WIDESPREAD SHORTCOMINGS INCONSISTENCIES IN THE WAY POLICE RESPOND THE WAY THAT FORCES CATEGORISE MISSING CHILDREN DIFFERS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE CATEGORIES DETERMINE OFTEN THE RESPONSE THAT THE POLICE GIVE THERE ARE CASES THAT THE INSPECTORATE FOUND OF POLICE UNDERESTIMATING THE RISKS FACING A CHILD WHEN THEY DISAPPEAR AND SOME CASES THEY DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A CHILD WILL COME TO HARM AND THERE WERE ALSO CASES
IN WHICH THE POLICE SAW THE CHILD AS A TIME WASTER WHEN THEY REPEATEDLY WENT MISSING RATHER THAN SOMEONE WHO WAS VULNERABLE WHICH IS THE EXTRAORDINARY RANGE OF CRITICISMS THERE ARE THEY SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE FORCES
YES I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY PARTICULAR FORESAW OR NUMBER OF FORCES THAT WAS SINGLED OUT FOR CRITICISM THESE WERE PROBLEMS THAT GO RIGHT ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES AND THERE WAS SOME POLICE OFFICERS ACCORDING TO THE REPORT WHO DISPLAYED NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TO MISSING CHILDREN AND THAT THE INSPECTOR SAID UNDERMINED THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE AS A SOURCE OF PROTECTION AND HELP SOME ATTITUDES DESCRIBED AS PUNITIVE
BY CHILDREN AT THERE WERE EXAMPLES FOR INSTANCE OF A CHILD WHO'D BEEN THREATENED WITH A TAYZA HER BECAUSE SHE RAN AWAY ANOTHER CHILD SAID THEY'RE REALLY RUDE SOME OF THEM I'VE BEEN SWORN AT BY A POLICE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES LIKE THAT
THE REPORT MAKES A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS IT SAYS THERE SHOULD BE A NATIONAL DATABASE OF MISSING CHILDREN THERE SHOULD BE A REVIEW OF THE PLACEMENT OF LOOKED AFTER CHILDREN IN OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITY AREAS THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF NORFOLK TWENTY FOURTEEN SET FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY LOOKED AFTER CHILDREN HAVE BEEN PLACED THERE WITHOUT THE POLICE FORCE BEING INFORMED IN THAT THAT CAN CREATE PROBLEMS AND THEN THERE'S ALSO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVED INFORMATION GATHERING AND TRAINING FOR OFFICERS AND THAT'S IN PART BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO KNOW THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM OF CHILDREN GETTING MESSY
YES THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS COLLECTING THE DATA WAS A REAL CHALLENGE I THINK FOR THE INSPECTORATE WHICH IS WHY THEY WANT TO SEE A DATABASE ESTABLISHED IF YOU HAVE GOOD INFORMATION YOU HAVE A DATABASE AND THE INFORMATION COULD BE SHARED THEN THAT IS ONE WAY TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM DANNY SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S COMING UP TO FORTY TWO MINUTES PAST SIX THE MOMENT AND WILL TAKE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS DOMINATE THE FRONT PAGES NOT JUST HERE IN BELGIUM OF COURSE BUT IN THE U.K. AS WELL MOST FEATURE A PHOTO TAKEN FROM C. C. T. V. SHOWING THE THREE SUSPECTS WILLING TROLLEY'S THROUGH THE AIRPORT
BLACK GLOVED SUICIDE SQUAD AND THE BOMBER WHO GOT AWAY IS THE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WHICH POINTS OUT THAT TWO OF THE MEN WHO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE BLOWN THEMSELVES UP WEARING SINGLE BLACK GLOVES POSSIBLY TO CONCEAL TRIGGERS FOR EXPLOSIVES CONTAINED IN THEIR LUGGAGE
PRIMED SUSPECTS HE'S THE HEADLINE IN THE SUN THE PAPER'S COVERAGE OF THE METRO BOMB ON THE INSIDE PAGES HE'S HEADLINED FIREBALL AT NINE ELEVEN AND IT SUGGESTS THE BLAST MAY HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY TIMED TO ECHO THE SEPTEMBER THE ELEVENTH ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES
BEFORE THE ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS IT WAS GEORGE OSBORNE WHO WAS THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION IN THE PAPERS ALL REFLECT ON HIS COMMON SPEECH YESTERDAY DEFENDING THEIR DECISION TO SHELVE PROPOSED CUTS TO DISABILITY BENEFITS ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET
A ROBUST PERFORMANCES THE F. TEAS VERDICT MICHAEL DEACON IN THE TELEGRAPH DESCRIBED IT AS A DISPLAY OF ALMOST RABID BRAVADO BUT FORGET THE MAGUIRE OF THE MIRROR THE CHANCER SHOWED THAT HE IS TO COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM WHAT DON JUAN WAS TO CHASTITY
A NEW DAY AND DAILY EXPRESS HIGHLIGHT RESEARCH FROM THE UNITED STATES SUGGESTING THAT MEDITATION COULD BE USED TO TREAT BACK PAIN THE STUDY INVOLVED A PARTICULAR TYPE OF MEDITATION KNOWN AS MINDFULNESS BASED STRESS REDUCTION BOTH PAPERS QUOTE THE LEAD RESEARCHER IS SAYING THAT TRAINING THE BRAIN TO RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO PAIN SIGNALS MAYBE MORE EFFECTIVE FANNED LAST LONGER THAN TRADITIONAL PHYSICAL THERAPY AND MEDICATION
THE TIMES REPORTS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS THERE'S BEEN A FALL IN THE AMOUNT OF HOUSEHOLD WASTE THAT'S RECYCLED IN THE U.K. THE PAPER SAYS THE REDUCTION BLAMED ON A COMBINATION OF APATHY AND CONFUSION MEANS BRITAIN RISKS AND BEING FINED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS FOR FAILING TO MEET E.U. TARG
AND THE GUARDIAN SO IT'S A GROUP OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CORNISH HISTORIANS HAS CRITICISED ENGLISH HERITAGE OVER ITS PLANS FOR TIN TATCHELL CASTLE THEY'VE ACCUSED THE ORGANISATION OF TURNING ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT HISTORICAL SITES INTO A FAIRYTALE THEME PARK BASED ON THE LEGEND OF KING ARTHUR THE HEAD OF THE WIZARD MERLIN
IT'S ALREADY BEEN CARVED INTO A ROCK FACE AND THERE ARE PLANS FOR A LARGE SCULPTURE A COMPASS INSTALLATION AND A NEW FOOTBRIDGE FROM THE MAINLAND TO THE ISLAND FORTRESS TO CORNWALL ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL HISTORIANS SAYS IF ENGLISH HERITAGE WANTS TO COMBINE HISTORY AND FANTASY IT SHOULD HAND THE MEDIEVAL SITE OVER TO DISS
THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT A MAN BELIEVED TO BE ONE OF THE GANG INVOLVED IN YESTERDAY'S BOMBINGS IN BRUSSELS IN WHICH THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE DIED HE'S ON THE RUN THIS MORNING
NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAD A COMFORTABLE MAJORITY AT THE END OF THE BUDGET DEBATE LAST NIGHT THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE SAID THAT WHERE HE'D GOT THINGS WRONG HE HAD LISTENED AND LEARNED BUT LABOUR SAID THESE WITH A GRUBBY MANIPULATIONS OF A POLITICAL CHANCER HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN
M.P.S HAD COME ALONG AND FORCED TO THE COMMONS FIRED UP ABOUT WHAT THEY'D EXPECTED TO BE THE BIG EVENT OF THE DAY A SPEECH FROM THE CHANCELLOR WHEN HE'D TRY TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE DONE TO HIS REPUTATION BY THE UNRAVELLING OF PARTS OF HIS BUDGET BUT THE THUNDEROUS CHEERS AND CAT CALLS HAD TO SKITTER TO A HALT AS GEORGE OSBORNE'S OPENING WORDS BECAME CLEAR
LET ME START BY OFFERING ALL OF OUR CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO THE ATTACKS IN BELGIUM THE FULL DETAILS OF THIS MORNING'S HORRIFIC ATTACKS ARE STILL EMERGING
BUT THE POLITICS OF GEORGE OSBORNE'S BUDGET COULDN'T BE AVOIDED FIRST THE RESIGNATION OF THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH OVER THE DISABILITY BENEFIT CUTS WHICH SO DERAILED THE BUDGET THE CHANCELLOR SAID HE WAS SORRY MISTER DUNCAN SMITH HAD DECIDED TO LEAVE THE CABINET INDEED IT TURNS OUT THEY'VE BEEN GREAT CHUMS AND GOVERNMENT I AM VERY
MY RIGHT HON OR FRIEND AND I WORK TOGETHER LONGER THAN ANY TWO PEOPLE
DOING OUR JOBS BEFORE US IN ANY GOVERNMENT AND WE HAVE BEEN PART OF THE TEAM BUT HE'S REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON OUT THERE WERE BENEFITS TO LEVELS NOT SEE
WELL A DOZEN LABOUR M.P.S HAD LEAPT TO THEIR FEET TO PREVENT THE CHANCELLOR TURNING THIS INTO A GOOD NEWS STORY CHRIS LESLIE REMINDED HIM HE'D HAD TO ABANDON HIS WELFARE SQUEEZE HE'S MADE A WELCOME YOU TURN BUT SHOULDN'T KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS A MISTAKE THAT YOU SHOULD SAY SORRY
GEORGE OSBORNE RECKONED HE'D SAID WHAT HE NEEDED TO I MADE IT VERY CLEAR I JUST SAID
WHERE WE'VE MADE A MISTAKE WHERE WE'VE GOT THINGS WRONG WE LISTEN AND WE LEARN AS PRECISELY WHAT WE'VE DONE BUT WHERE IS THE APOLOGY FROM THE LABOUR
AND THAT THOUGHT ABOUT LABOUR'S MISTAKES AND OFFICE SEEM TO GET GEORGE OSBORNE QUITE WORKED UP IT WAS THE POOREST TO PAY THE BRA
PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR JOBS AND HAD THEIR LIVELIHOOD SNATCHED FROM THEM THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT I AM FIGHTING FOR REAL DO YOU SAY
SPREAD THE S.N.P. IS GEORGE CARAVAN CALLED THAT A BRAVURA PERFORMANCE ALL THE SAME I'M ALWAYS WORRIED WHEN WHEN THE CHANCELLOR GOES INTO HIS EXPANSIVE EMOTIONAL MOMENT WHAT'S HE HIDING
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL DIDN'T THINK GEORGE OSBORNE CUT QUITE SUCH A HEROIC FIGURE EITHER FIRST THOUGH HE TOO HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES
WE SUPPORT THAT SHOULD PURITY MEASURES OF COURSE TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT AND WE SAY TO THE PEOPLE THE BELGIUM WE STAND WITH RHYS
BUT THEN HE TURNED TO THE CHANCELLOR HE SAID HIS BEHAVIOUR CALLED INTO QUESTION HIS FITNESS FOR OFFICE ALWAYS
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS NOT THE ACTIONS OF A CHANCELLOR AS SENIOR GOVERNMENT MINISTER
BUT THE GRUBBY INCOMPETENT MANIPULATIONS OF A POLITICAL CHANGE
THAT GOT CONSERVATIVES FLINGING A PROTECTIVE ARM ROUND THE CHANCELLOR JAMES CARTILAGE WAS PREPARED TO GET JUST AS PERSONAL REFERRING TO REMARKS MISTER MCDONNELL MADE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE ABOUT I R.A. BOMBS HAVING HELP TO BRING ABOUT THE PEACE PROCESS IT MAKES A VERY PERSONAL POINT ABOUT FITNESS FOR OFFICE ON A DAY OF A MAJOR TERRORIST ATTACK
THE TIGHTS THERE WAS UPROAR JOHN MCDONNELL POINTED TO HIS CONDEMNATION OF THE ATTACKS AND BRUSSELS AND TO BRING THAT INTO THE GREAT AS A POLITICAL POINT AT THIS STAGE IS
JOHN MCDONNELL PRESSED ON TO SAY THIS WAS A BUDGET INFUSE NOT WITH COMPASSION BUT WITH UNFAIRNESS ARE LONG TERM ECONOMIC PLAN THAT LASTED THREE DAYS
BARGER BUILT AROUND SHORT TERM POLITICAL TACTIC IT'S DARREN'S BACK FIVE SPECTRE
IT WAS A RAUCOUS IRRITABLE FINAL SESSION OF THE DEBATE BUT IN THE END THE BUDGET A LITTLE ALTERED FROM THE ONE UNVEILED LESS THAN A WEEK AGO WAS APPROVED LAST NIGHT BY A GOVERNMENT MAJORITY OF THIRTY FIVE
SUSAN HUME AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE DIGITAL RADIO JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT
IT'S NOW TEN TO SEVEN AND AFTER YESTERDAY'S ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS THE PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON WILL CHAIR A SECOND MEETING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S EMERGENCY COBRA COMMITTEE HERE TO CONSIDER WHAT A RESPONSE SHOULD BE RICHARD BARRETT IS A FORMER DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL COUNTER TERRORISM OPERATIONS FOR THE BRITISH SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE HE'S NOW A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT THE SECURITY CONCERTS CONSULTANCY THE SUE FOUND GROUP AND I ASKED HIM IF AN ATTACK LIKE THE ONE WE'VE JUST SEEN IN BELGIUM COULD JUST AS EASILY HAPPEN HERE
I WOULD SAY SO YES I MEAN CLEARLY THE SECURITY SERVICES IN LONDON THE POLICE IN LONDON A BIGGER BETTER RESOURCED AND PAT AND PROBABLY MORE ON TO THE PROBLEM BUT
ALL THE SAME WE HAVE HAD ATTACKS IN LONDON LAST MAJOR ATTACK BEFORE PARIS WAS OF COURSE THE SEVEN SEVEN ATTACK IN LONDON AND I'M SURE THAT THE POLICE SERVICES SKIRTY SERVICE WOULD ADMIT THAT YOU ARE SURE YOU CAN VERY EASILY HAPPEN HERE SO I THINK WOULD BE WRONG TO BLAME THE BELGIANS I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT HOW CAN WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT THE RISK OF THIS HAPPENING AGAIN WAS AS LIMITED AS POSSIBLE
AND IN TERMS OF THAT WE'VE SEEN OBVIOUSLY NOT JUST BRUSSELS BUT ALSO ATTACKS IN ISTANBUL QUITE A FEW RECENTLY ARE WE LOOKING AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT NOW BECAUSE PERHAPS SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO FIGHT FOR SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND ARE RETURNING WITH A DIFFERENT MINDSET AND UNDERMINES IT PLANNING TO ATTACK AT HOME
I DON'T THINK IT'LL ONLY BE PEOPLE WHO'VE GONE AND COME BACK BECAUSE I THINK A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN THE PARIS ATTACKS WOULD SAMPLE WERE NOT PEOPLE WHO COME BACK FROM SYRIA BUT THE THING ABOUT GOING TO WAR IS THAT IT CREATES VERY TIGHTKNIT GROUPS OF PEOPLE
AND IF YOU GO THERE BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN INVITED TO GO BUY A FRIEND WROTE FOR WHATEVER THIS HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN THEN THOSE SORT OF LINKS GET TIGHTER STILL SO WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU'RE ALL ABOUT YOU'RE IN GROUP AND NOTHING ABOUT THE OTHER GROUP NOTHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU MIGHT BE BE HARMING AND I THINK THAT THE SORT OF EXCITEMENT YOU KNOW THE SORT OF
ADRENALIN RUSH THE SORT OF THING WE GOT IT WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT LOOK AT THE MEDIA COVERAGE THESE THINGS GET SORT OF DRIVES IT FORWARD SO I THINK THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF IRAQ SYRIA PROBABLY DOES MAKE THESE THINGS MORE LIKELY PARTICULARLY IF THE ISLAMIC STATE WAS ON A DOWNWARD SLIDE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WOULD NECESSARILY NOT HAPPEN AT ALL IF THERE WEREN'T IRAQ AND SYRIA BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM HAPPENING HAD BEEN GREATLY INCREASED
WELL CLEARLY BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO YOU GET THAT IN A GROUP YOU GET BETTER TRAINING GET PEOPLE WITH ACCESS TO WEAPONS IN A PARTY USE THEM DINNER EXPLOSIVES AND SO ON AND THEY THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY COULD DO ELSEWHERE FROM A RELATIVELY SAFE ENVIRONMENT SO CLEARLY IT INCREASES THE RISK SO HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO IT WELL I THINK THE FIRST THING YOU RESPOND HE'S TRYING TO STOP THE WAR IN IRAQ AND SYRIA AT OF COURSE IS
RATHER SLOWLY AND A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO SOLVE BUT ON THE HOME FRONT I THINK YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW IS IT THAT THESE VERY TIGHT KNIT SMALL GROUPS CAN OPERATE WITHIN A MUCH MORE AMORPHOUS SOCIETY WITHOUT ANYBODY REALLY THINKING THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER LOOK INTO THIS YOU KNOW IT'S THE OLD ARGUMENT IF YOU LIKE
WOULD YOU BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS FOR YOUR COUNTRY OR YOUR COUNTRY FOR YOUR FRIENDS AND I THINK THAT IS STILL SOMETHING THAT SOCIETY GENERAL IN EUROPE IS GRAPPLING WITH AND HERE WE HAVE THIS SITUATION IN IN BRUSSELS WHERE SOMEBODY WHO WANTED ALL OVER THE WORLD IS THAT HE'S ABLE TO HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT
WELL THERE YOU ARE PRECISELY TO THAT DOESN'T THAT PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM WELL PROBABLY AS A CHILD GROW UP FEEL MORE LOYALTY TO HIM THAN THOSE DUE TO THE STATE RICHARD BARRETT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN AND THE ASH TREE IS LIKELY TO BE WIPED OUT IN EUROPE AT LEAST THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF A SCIENTIST WHO'S LOOKED AT ALL THE RESEARCH DONE ON ASH TREES IT'S NOT JUST ASH DIEBACK DISEASE CREATING A PROBLEM BUT ALSO APPARENTLY A NEW BEETLE CALLED THE EMERALD ASH BORER AND THE MAN BEHIND THE RESEARCH WHICH IS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF ECOLOGIST DOCTOR PETER THOMAS WHO'S A PLANT ECOLOGIST AT KEELE UNIVERSITY AND JOINS US FROM STOKE GOOD MORNING DOCTOR THOMAS MORNING
THE MAIN PROBLEM IT SEEMS FROM WHAT YOU'VE LOOKED AT THOUGH IT IS ASH DIEBACK ISN'T IT YES IT IS IT'S A DISEASE IT'S ALREADY IN THE BRITISH ISLES IT'S BEEN HERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IT'S IN AT LEAST A THOUSAND DIFFERENT SITES THROUGH THE ISLAND AND THEREFORE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ERADICATE AND IT WILL RESULT IN WHAT WELL THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS THAT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR ASH TREES WILL SUCCUMB TO THE DISEASE MAY TAKE TWENTY YEARS TO DIE BUT DIE THEY WILL
AND THAT'S JUST INEVITABLE THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THE DECEASED NO I MEAN THERE ARE A FEW THINGS WEEK WE CAN WORK TOWARDS SOMETHING LIKE ABOUT ONE PER CENT OF THE ASH TREES ARE LIKELY TO BE IMMUNE OR NOT IMMUNE RESISTANT TO THE DISEASE AND IF WE CAN TAKE THOSE AND BREED FROM THEM THEN WE CAN EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY REPOPULATE BRITAIN WITH ASHTRAYS WITH YOU BUT IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN ONLY DO WHEN THE DISEASE HAS RUN ITS COURSE WEATHERED CEASES HERE IT'S GOING TO BE AROUND THE WHOLE TIME HE'S NOT GOING AWAY
OH I SEE SO IF YOU BUT IF YOU CAN TAKE THE RESISTANT ONES YOU CAN REPOPULATE WITH RESISTANT TREES YEAH THERE BUT THAT THAT'S PROVIDING THE DISEASE ITSELF DOESN'T CHANGE IT CAN BE THAT DISEASES MUTATE THAT HAPPENED WITH THE DUTCH ELM DISEASE BACK IN THE SEVENTIES IT WAS A NEW STRAIN OF FUNGUS THAT CAUSED ALL THE DAMAGE SO THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT DISEASE COULD ITSELF COULD CHANGE BECAUSE THE TREES ARE RESISTANT BUT NOT IMMUNE SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE THEY COULD ALSO
AND THEN YOU PRESENT US WITH ANOTHER THREAT THE EMERALD ASH BORA THAT IS OF AN ASIAN BEETLE IT WAS INTRODUCED INTO NORTH AMERICA IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND IT'S KILL TENS OF MILLIONS OF ASH TREES ALREADY WE KNOW HAVE FAT INSECT IN MOSCOW FROM TWO THOUSAND THREE IT'S RUMOURED TO BE IN SWEDEN SO IF HE GETS THE BRITISH ISLES THE FEW TREES THAT SURVIVE THE ASH DIEBACK MAY WILL SUCCUMB TO THE COMMODE ASH
SO SIT UP IT DO WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE GIVE UP ON OUR ASHTRAYS TREES ALL NO NO CAN'T DO THAT THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE THAT THE FOREST COMMISSION HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD IN THE PAST IN KEEPING UNUSUAL BEETLES OUT CERTAINLY THE LAST FEW YEARS THE ASIAN LONGHORN BEETLE WHICH IS THREATENING OUR TREES FIRST CAME INTO BRITAIN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND THE FOREST COMMISSION HE VERY GOOD AT HAVING PLANTAIN OPERATION THAT STOP IT'S MEDICS IMAGES FOUND
IT'S DEALT WITH IT WOULD YOU PAINT SUCH A GLOOMY PICTURE FROM ASH DIEBACK PARTICULARLY I WANT I WAS WONDERING WHETHER WE SHOULD BE CAN MOVING TO THE POINT WHERE WE THINK O.K. WHAT COULD REPLACE OUR ASHES THAT'S A GOOD POINT THERE ARE VARIOUS TREES IN THE BRITISH ISLES ALREADY THAT WILL ECOLOGICALLY REPLACE THE ASH AND ALLOW A SPECIES EARTH LIKE AN INSECT A TRAP THAT LIVE ON THE ASH TREES TO ACTUALLY STILL SURVIVE THEY CAN SURVIVE ON THINGS LIKE THE ORDER OR SMALL LEAF LYMEL ROWAN TREE BUT IT WON'T LOOK THE SAME
AND THAT'S THE SHOW AND THAT'S WHY WE FIGHT FOR THE ASH EXACTLY EXACTLY DOCTOR PETER THOMAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR THE WEATHER WITH PHILIP AVERY MORNING FOR
MORNING MATTHEW THANKS VERY MUCH THAT WAS ALL RATHER GLOOMY FAIR WASN'T IT LET'S SEE IF THIS KEELE ALUMNUS CAN BRING YOU ANY CHEERIER NEWS LET'S START WITH THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND THERE'S A WEE BIT OF BRIGHTNESS AT THE MOMENT THE SKIES ARE PRETTY CLEAR OVERNIGHT SO IT'S A COLD START THERE I'M AFRAID THE CLOUD MAY WELL FILL HIM AT TIMES OF WALES AND THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND HOPES OF SOME BRIGHTNESS HERE AS WELL MAY TAKE A TIME TO GET THERE BUT I THINK WE WILL EVENTUALLY THERE IS JUST THE CHANCE THAT THE CUMBRIAN FELLS SEE A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN FROM A WEAKENING WEATHER FRONT VERY LATE ON IN THE DAY OTHERWISE IT'S PRETTY DRY FAIR
IF YOU SEE SOME SUNSHINE YOU COULD GET INTO DOUBLE FIGURES IF YOU DON'T SINGLE FIGURES WILL BE YOURS NOW FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND HERE IT'S A FAIRLY CLOUDY PICTURE AND FOR THE MOST PART THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOING TO STAY I'M HOPEFUL OF A LITTLE BIT OF BRIGHTNESS BREAKING OUT ACROSS EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST AND HERE AGAIN WILL DO WONDERS FOR THE TEMPERATURE'S ALMOST SPRING LIKE AS THE TEMPERATURES SOAR AWAY TO RUN ABOUT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN
PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTH EAST FOR NORTHERN IRELAND A DRY ENOUGH START A WEAK WEATHER FRONT IS WANDERING IN FROM THE ATLANTIC AND EVENTUALLY I THINK YOU'LL SEE HER JUST A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN FROM THIS IT'S NOT THE STRONGEST THING ON TWO LEGS BY ANY MEANS AT ALL ONCE IT'S THROUGH EARLY THIS AFTERNOON WE'LL SEE SOME SUNSHINE ONE OR TWO SHOWERS PERHAPS TO FINISH OFF THE DAY THE TEMPERATURES ON A RANGE OF TEN TO ELEVEN
AND FINALLY FOR THE DAY TO SCOTLAND OH HERE PRETTY CLOUDY FAIR AGAIN AND SAME WEAK WEATHER FRONT WILL BE A BOTHER FOR THE WESTERN ISLES THE WEST OF THE MAINLAND AROUND ABOUT LUNCHTIME WHAT IS LEFT OF IT WILL STAGGER OVER TO THE EAST JUST IN TIME FOR TEA FOLLOWING ON BEHIND A MIXTURE OF SUNNY SPELLS ON ONE OR TWO REALLY SHARP SHOWERS TEMPERATURES OF EIGHT TO TEN

THAT WAS GAVIN LEAD TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE AT THE AIRPORT YESTERDAY WE'RE JUST GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF NEWS THROUGH THAT LOCAL MEDIA REPORTING
THAT THOSE TWO MEN WHO THE PROSECUTOR SAYS BLEW THEMSELVES UP AT THE AIRPORT THEY
ARE NOW BEING IDENTIFIED BY LOCAL MEDIA COLOURED AND EVA HIM OUTBACK WIRY THEY ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE HAD LINKS TO THE PARIS ATTACKERS THEY ARE TWO BROTHERS AND THEY WERE KNOWN TO THE POLICE
FOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY SO THAT STARTS TO FILL IN SOME OF THE GAPS THAT WE'VE HAD IN OUR KNOWLEDGE SO FAR ABOUT WHO CARRIED OUT THESE ATTACKS OF COURSE A THIRD MAN THE PROSECUTOR BELIEVES HE'S STILL ON THE RUN AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE STILL SEARCHING FOR HIM
I'M GOING TO BRING IN LOURDES JONATHAN HILL NOW THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CAPITAL MARKETS UNION HE'S OUR MOST SENIOR MAN IN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION GOOD MORNING LORD HELP GOOD MORNING
YOU WERE IN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION BUILDING AT THE TIME THAT THE METRO ATTACK TOOK PLACE IT'S ONLY A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS FROM THERE DO YOU SEE ANYTHING
WE HEARD THE REPORTS COMING IN AND AT THE TIME WE WERE JUST TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE EARLIER ATTACK IT'S HAPPENED
THEN THE REPORTS STARTED COMING IN ABOUT THAT BEING A BOMB AT THE METRO PEOPLE LOOKED OUT YOU COULD SEE A PLUME OF SMOKE AND THEN INITIALLY SHOCK
THE GRADUAL REALISATION THAT THIS WAS A SERIOUS ATTACK ALSO BECAME CLEAR AND PRESUMABLY US THE BUILDING YOU WERE UNDER LOCKDOWN NOBODY COULD LEAVE WAS THERE A SENSE THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY SOME SORT OF ATTACK ON THE ACTUAL INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES THAT PERHAPS YOU WERE THE TARGET IN A BROADER SENSE NO I THINK THIS WAS AN ATTACK ON PEOPLE AT LARGE IT WAS AN ATTACK ON PEOPLE GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS AT AN AIRPORT PEOPLE IN THE RUSH HOUR GOING TO WORK THEY LEFT HOME
HALF AN HOUR EARLIER GOING OFF IN THE NORMAL WAY TO WORK THEM BETWEEN STATIONS SUDDENLY A BOMB GOES OFF SO I THINK TO INTERPRETED AS AN ATTACK
AN INSTITUTION WOULD BE TWO KIND OVER INTERPRET WHAT WAS GOING ON I THINK IT WAS A DELIBERATE ATTACK ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RUSSIA IN THE HEART OF THE CITY AND AT THE AIRPORT I LIVED IN THIS CITY FOR FOUR YEARS I LEFT JUST BEFORE YOU ARRIVED AND
WHEN I CAME INTO BRUSSELS YESTERDAY I HAD NEVER SEEN US THIS CITY SO QUIET IT WAS QUITE EASY TO DRIVE AROUND DESPITE THE FACT THAT ALL THE OLD PUBLIC TRANSPORT WAS WAS SWITCHED OFF IT
HE DID SHUT DOWN THIS CITY FOR A DAY DIDN'T IT IT DID BUT I THINK I WALKED HOME LAST NIGHT AT THE END OF IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS IN MY OWN KIND OF PROBABLY MEANINGLESS GESTURE I THOUGHT IMPORTANT THAT I SHOULD WALK THROUGH THE SITTING AND NOT JUST GO HOME
KIND OF IN THE CAR I WALK THROUGH THE CITY THROUGH THE PLACE THAT YOU WILL REMEMBER AND THERE WERE PEOPLE SITTING THERE HAVING A DRINK IN THE BARS THE BARS WERE FULL OF YOUNG PEOPLE
AND I TOOK THAT WAS ACTUALLY RATHER ENCOURAGING SIGN LOTS OF PEOPLE WALKING BECAUSE AS YOU SAY THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT THEN WASN'T WORKING IT'S PART OF WORKING AGAIN THIS MORNING TRAMS RUNNING ARE BUSES RUNNING METRO RUNNING THE TRAIN STATIONS
OUR OPENING SO I THINK THERE ARE SIGNS OF LIFE GETTING BACK TO NORMAL AFTER THAT INITIAL SHOCK AND AS YOU SAY THE CITY WAS VERY QUIET YESTERDAY THIS IS NORMALLY A CITY WITH TERRIBLE TRAP A TRANSPORT TRAFFIC JAMS
NONE OF THOSE BUT I FEEL THIS MORNING NICE COMING BACK TO YOU TO NORMAL LIFE COMING BACK TO NORMAL PERHAPS NEVERTHELESS THE POLICY QUESTIONS ARE THE ENORMOUS THIS MORNING
CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF THE DISCUSSION WITHIN THE COMMISSION YESTERDAY AND ONGOING ABOUT HOW THE EUROPEAN UNION TACKLES
I THINK THAT WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE FIRST OF ALL HIS CO OPERATION BETWEEN
MEMBER STATES ON THE SUM OF THE MEMBER STATES INCLUDING OUR OWN IN THE U.K. WHERE WE HAVE HAD TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF TERRORISM THE FRENCH AS WELL
THERE'S MORE THAT CAN BE DONE I THINK TO SHARE THAT EXPERTISE TO LEARN THE LESSONS WHERE WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IT BEFORE MORE IN TERMS OF INTELLIGENCE SHARON I THINK I THINK THERE'S WORK THAT COULD BE DONE TO DO THAT I ALSO THINK THAT
IT IS SENSIBLE TO LOOK AT WHETHER THERE ARE MORE COMMON APPROACHES THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE WE'LL BE DISCUSSING THAT LATER THIS MORNING WHEN THE COLLEGE OF COMMISSIONERS MEET AND A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT BORDERS THE SHOWING AN AGREEMENT LEAVES THEM OPEN
ALTHOUGH SERIOUS THOUGHTS NOW THAT ACTUALLY THAT THE MOTHER MIGHT HAVE TO BE RE THOUGHT I THINK ONE NEEDS TO KEEP THESE ISSUES SEPARATELY IF YOU THINK WHAT WE HAD IN THE U.K. ON SEVEN SEVEN WE'RE A COUNTRY OUTSIDE SHANNON WHERE WE HAD TERRORISTS HOME GROWN SADLY
I THINK THERE ARE QUESTIONS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT SHOWING HIM HOW IT'S OPERATING HE NEEDS TO OPERATE BETTER WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE CAREFULLY WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AT THE MOMENT BUT I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP THAT SEPARATE FROM THIS QUESTION OF THIS TERRIBLE TERRORISM YESTERDAY LORD JONATHAN HILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

SEE ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW THE INSURANCE GIANT LLOYDS OF LONDON HAS JUST REPORTED
SHOT FALLING PROFITS ADAM IS HERE WITH THAT MOUTHY THANK YOU FIGURES OUT THIS MORNING FROM THE THE SPECIALIST INSURANCE AND RE INSURANCE GROUP REPORTING A PROFIT OF TWO POINT ONE BILLION POUNDS BUT THAT IS THIRTY PERCENT DOWN ON LAST YEAR JOHN NELSON AS WITH ME THE CHAIRMAN OF LLOYD'S OF LONDON GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT SQUEEZING THE PROFITS
THE MAIN SQUEEZE ON PROFITS HAS BEEN THE SUBSTANTIAL DROP AN INVESTMENT INCOME IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT DROPPED FROM ABOUT A BILLION POUNDS TO FOUR HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS DUE TO OBVIOUSLY MARKET CONDITIONS WE HAVE TO INVEST VERY SHORT BECAUSE AND VERY LIQUID BECAUSE WE HOLD FUNDS TO PAY CLAIMS THAT'S WHAT A CAPITALIST FOR SO WE ARE VERY MUCH AT THE FRONT END OF THE FLOW INTEREST RATES
ON TOP OF THAT BECAUSE STILL LLOYD'S IS PERFORMING RELATIVELY VERY WELL WE'RE SHOWING A RETURN ON CAPITAL OF NINE PER CENT I A MEASURE OF PROFITABILITY THE SO CALLED COMBINE RATIO WE'RE OUTPERFORMING ART COMPETITION WE ARE ATTRACTING CAPITAL INTO THE MARKET BECAUSE OF OF
ASSET CLASSES GIVING LOWER RETURNS SO THAT HIS INTERN PUTTING PRESSURE ON PREMIUM RATES SO WE HAVE TWO FORCES HARD AT WORK ON US BUT WE'RE IN A VERY STRONG POSITION OUR BUSINESS FRANCHISE WORLDWIDE IS I THINK IMPROVING WE ARE STILL THE GLOBAL HUB FOR SPECIALIST INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS AND REMEMBER WERE A MARKET WE'RE NOT A COMPANY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SPECIALIST INSURANCE WHAT WHAT DO YOU SAY AT THE MOMENT AS THE GREAT
THREATS THE PEOPLE ARE ENSURING AGAINST WILL COME TO BRUSSELS IN A MOMENT BUT BUT CYBER TERRORISM IS THAT A GRAND THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF RISKS THAT WE WRITE ITS WOULD BE CATASTROPHE RISK OR BUSINESS TO BUSINESS RISK SO IT'S SO COMMERCIAL RISK AND IN THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS SPACE YOU'RE SEEING CHANGES IN THE WAY IN WHICH BUSINESSES OPERATE BUSINESS MODELS CYBER IS AN OBVIOUS ONE CERTAIN TYPES OF OTHER SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION
AND THEN WE WE DO A WHOLE LOAD OF SPECIALIST LINES SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE ONES THAT WE LOOK AT VERY CLOSELY AT THE MOMENT IS DRONES WHICH IS IS IS IS A GROWING MARKET WITH US THAT'S A VERY NICHE PRODUCT LOOK LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT EVENTS IN BRUSSELS
AND THE THREAT FROM SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE BUT WHAT EFFECT DOES THAT HAVE ON THE INSURANCE MARKET WELL LLOYDS OF COURSE PROVIDES TERRORIST COVER THAT IS ONE OF OUR SPECIALIST LINES REGRETTABLY TRAGICALLY IT'S A GROWING THREAT IT'S A GROWING PART OF OUR BUSINESS
IT'S STILL NOT AN AN ENORMOUS PART OF OUR BUSINESS BUT IT'S THERE AND REALLY WHAT LLOYD'S IS THERE TO DO IS TO PROVIDE WRIST MITIGATION AND FINANCIAL SOLUTION SO WE CAN GET COMMUNITIES BUSINESSES INFRASTRUCTURE BACK ON THEIR FEET QUICKLY AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO RUN RIGHT ROUND THE WORLD JOHN NELSON MANY THANKS TO THAT IS THE CHAIRMAN OF LLOYD'S OF LONDON
ADAM THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE AMOUNT OF RUBBISH ON BRITISH BEACHES HAS GONE UP BY A THIRD ACCORDING TO THE MARINE CONSERVATION SOCIETY IN THEIR MOST RECENT NATIONAL CLEAN UP OF OUR COASTLINE THE PICKED UP MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND PLASTIC BOTTLES AND THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE NOW CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO PUT A CHARGE ON BOTTLES THAT CAN BE REFUNDED WHEN THEY'RE RETURNED LAUREN AILSA'S BEACH WATCH OFFICER AT THE MARINE CONSERVATION SOCIETY GOOD MORNING TO YOU
MORNING AND IT'S A STAGGERING JUMP SINCE THE LAST TIME YOU DID A CLEARER CLEAR OUT THE YEAR BEFORE YEAH IT IS UNFORTUNATELY LITTER LEVELS AND FEATURES ARE INCREASING MASSIVELY WHICH IS A HUGE CONCERN FOR EVERYBODY REALLY YOU KNOW WE NEED TO SEE THESE LEVELS COME DOWN TO ENJOY OUR BEACHES FOR EVERYBODY BUT ALSO TO TRY AND PROTECT THE MARINE WILDLIFE THAT WE GET IN A U.K. WATERS AS WELL AND IS THIS FROM PEOPLE DROPPING RUBBISH OR IT WASHING UP FROM THE SEA OR WHAT
IT'S A MIXTURE A LOT OF IT COMES FROM US IS THE PUBLIC SO THINGS THAT ARE LEFT ON THE BEACHES THINGS THAT ARE BLOWN IN FROM LAND IT ALSO COMES FROM FISHING THOUGH FROM SHIPPING FROM FLY FLY TIPPING AND THINGS THAT PEOPLE THROW DOWN THE TOILETS AS WELL WHICH THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T SO A HUGE VARIETY OF PLACES THAT IT DOES COME FROM BUT THE THING THAT STOOD OUT TO YOU WEAR THESE PLASTIC BOTTLES WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT IF YOU HAD A DEPOSIT
IT MIGHT AFFECT CHANGE BEHAVIOUR TELL US HOW YOU THINK IT COULD WORK YEAH SO WE FOUND NEARLY ONE HUNDRED BOTTLES FOR EVERY KILOMETRE THAT WAS SURVEY DURING ONE WEEKEND IN SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY HIGH AMOUNT THESE BOTTLES HAVE INCREASED BY OVER WELL OVER FORTY THREE PERCENT FROM THE YEAR BEFORE SO OBVIOUSLY THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO SEE CONTINUE BUT THERE IS A SOLUTION WHICH IS THE GOOD NEWS IN THE FORM OF A DEPOSIT RETURNED SYSTEM SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL
LOOK AND IT'S BEEN PROVEN TO WORK IN COUNTRIES ALREADY SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TRIED AND TESTED IT OBVIOUSLY PUTS A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE ON PEOPLE TO RETURN DRINKS CONTAINERS SO THESE ARE ALL SINGLE USE DRINKS CONTAINERS SO THAT INCLUDES GLASS BOTTLES PLASTIC BOTTLES CANS AND ALUMINIUM SO THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE WILL GO TO A SOMETHING CALLED A REVERSE VENDING MACHINE AND THEY WILL RETURN THEIR CONTAINER AND RETURN A SMALL DEPOSIT BACK FOR THAT CONTAINER
SO OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW RECYCLING IS HUGE THIS PUTS AN EMPHASIS ON HER CYCLING AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BUT PEOPLE WE FEEL THAT IT WILL CHANGE PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED BY DIFFERENT THINGS AND MONEY OF COURSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE SO YOU KNOW IT
WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL WORK AND THE FACT THAT IT HAS ALREADY PROVEN TO WORK IN MANY COUNTRIES ALREADY IT'S IN SUPPORT OF THAT BUT YOU'RE PROPOSING TO LEVY WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY A C. AND AN EXTRA TAX THAT WILL BE COLLECTED PRESUMABLY FROM RETAILERS AND THEN USED TO REIMBURSE PEOPLE AT THESE REVERSE VENDING POINTS AS YOU
WELL I MEAN IT'S NOT ATTACK SO CONTAINERS WILL BE PURCHASED AS NORMAL AND THEY WILL REMAIN THE SAME PRICE THEN THE SMALL DEPOSIT WILL BE RETURNED FOR THE CONTAINER ONCE THEY'RE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY RETURNED TO THESE VENDING MACHINES SO THEY HAVE THE MONEY IT'S KIND OF COST NEUTRAL SO YOU KNOW THE MONEY WILL BE RETURNED BACK TO THE CUSTOMER WHEN THE BOTTLE IS RETURNED AND THE POINT IS THAT YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE SHOP'S MANAGE THEIR SCHEME
NO NO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT FOR THEM TO MANAGE IT THE VENDING MACHINES WILL BE PLACED AT DIFFERENT POINTS SO CONVENIENT POINTS SO BIG SUPERMARKETS AT PETROL STATIONS AND IT'S UP TO US AS THE CONSUMER OF THE BOTTLES TO RETURN THEM BUT THE POINT IS THAT IT'S CONVENIENT YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN MAJOR PLACES IT'S GOING TO BE CONVENIENT FOR ONLINE SHOPPING OBVIOUSLY MORE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE DO THAT NOW
SO YOU CAN RETURN THE BOTTLES YOU KNOW ONCE YOU'RE ONLINE SHOPPING IS DELIVERED AND THAT WILL BE REFUNDED STRAIGHT TO YOUR ACCOUNT LAUREN ALE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

ONE ONE THRILLING THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA IN THE CAPTAIN MORGAN WON'T IDENTIFY THOUGH ANY OF TODAY'S OPPOSITION ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS I THINK THEY'RE A GOOD UNIT I THINK TO SINGLE OUT ANY ONE PLAYER
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT STUPID REALLY THEY ARE THEY'RE A STRONG SIDE WHEN YOU PUT ALL ELEVEN PLAYERS TOGETHER SO WE'RE NOT SINGLING ANYBODY WITH TREATING EVERY PLATE THE SAME HOWEVER CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN AGNEW WAS HAPPY TO PICK OUT ONE OF AFGHANISTAN'S PLAYERS WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM A SHORT WHILE AGO
WELL I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING SHOWERS OUT AGAIN THE WICKET KEEPER HE'S A ROTUND PORTLY FELLOW WHO ALSO OPENS THE BATTING AND ABSOLUTELY SAVAGED THE SOUTH AFRICANS OF THE DAY IS NOT NECESSARILY ELEGANT OR SUBTLE BUT HE JUST THROWS THE BAT AND IN A WAY THAT RATHER SUMS UP AFGHANISTAN'S CRICKET AND WHEN IS THE PEOPLE WHO
I'M NOT REMOTELY INTIMIDATED BY THE FACT THEY'RE PLAYING AGAINST THE LIKES OF ENGLAND OR SOUTH AFRICA THEY'VE GOT TREMENDOUS ATTITUDE THEY'VE MANAGED TO CONTROL SOME OF THEIR PERHAPS OVER EXUBERANCE THAT THEY'VE SHOWN IN THE PAST THEY'VE BEEN COACHED BY INZAMAM UL HAQ
WITH THE MOST LAID BACK INTERNATIONAL CRICKET PART OF THE PAKISTANI BACKED AND OF COURSE THERE'S EVER BEEN NOTHING HAS BEEN QUITE A GOOD INFLUENCE ON THEIR MACS AND JUST CALMING THEM DOWN A BIT WITHOUT TAKING AWAY THAT REALLY AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDE WHICH MEANS THAT THEY SIMPLY DON'T LAY DOWN AND GIVE UP THEY WILL KEEP COMING IF ENGLAND PLAY WELL
THEY SHOULD BEAT THEM RELATIVELY EASILY AND THEY SHOULD ALSO IMPROVE THE NET RUN RATE WHICH ALSO HAVE THE COMPLICATED BUT ACTUALLY IT WHEN IT COMES TO QUALIFICATION MIGHT BE QUITE IMPORTANT ALTHOUGH EOIN MORGAN STRESSED TO ME YESTERDAY FORGET THAT ONE RIGHT FORGET TRYING TO WIN TOO EASILY WE'VE JUST GOT TO GET THE TWO POINTS AND ESSENTIALLY HE'S RIGHT YES A MORE GENERAL THOUGHT TO FINISH JONATHAN A BIT TOO EARLY TO JUDGE FULLY MAYBE BUT DO YOU SENSE THAT THE POPULARITY OF THE T. TWENTY FORMAT WILL HAVE BEEN BOOSTED ONCE HIS TOURNAMENT IS AT AN END
I THINK SO IT'S HARD AND I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON THIS TOURNAMENT AND I'M NOT COUNTING MYSELF I THINK WE AND ENGLAND HAVE HAD QUITE AN EASY RIDE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHERS IT MAKES A VERY FAR FLUNG TOURNAMENT THIS AND FAR TOO MUCH SO THE BEAUTY OF WHAT THIS TOURNAMENT USED TO BE WHAT IT WAS QUICK IT WAS CONTROLLED PLAYED IN TWO OR THREE CENTRES HAVE GOT LOTS OF CRICKET PLAYED IN THE SAME PLACE IT WAS VERY SIMPLY DUMB THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY HAS HAS CHANGED QUITE DRAMATICALLY GOT YOUR PLAYING HALF UP THE HIMALAYAS THIS MATCH WITH THE VENUE FOR THE SEMI FINAL
WE STILL DON'T KNOW IF THE SEMI FINAL WILL BE PLAYED HERE OR NOT WHICH WOULD CAUSE ALL SORTS OF CHAOS SO IN SOME WAYS I THINK THIS TOURNAMENT HAS RUN AWAY WITH ITSELF A LITTLE BIT BUT AS FAR AS TEA PLENTY AND THE ACTUAL FORMAT OF THE GAME AND THE SKILLS OF THE PLAYERS BUT I SUPPOSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT DOES KEEP IMPROVING YEAR BY YEAR AND JONATHAN THE TEAM ON FIVE LIVE SPORTS EXTRA WITH COMMENTARY FROM NINE FIFTEEN ONWARDS THIS MORNING SO THEN RIGHT NOW TO THE RACING TIPS HEY NOT FOR THIRTY NUMBER ONE LISTEN BOY SADDLE TWO O'CLOCK ALSO NUMBER ONE EDGAR

THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO EIGHT THERE IS A SCENE OF REFLECTION IN THE CENTRE OF BRUSSELS THIS MORNING CANDLES HAVE BEEN LIT AND THOUGHTS WRITTEN IN COLOURED CHALK ON THE PAVEMENT ONE HERE IN VIBRANT BLUE SAYS LOVE IS A RESISTANCE BUT THAT CLEARLY WON'T BE ENOUGH AT THIS MOMENT FORENSIC TEAMS ARE CONTINUING TO EXAMINE BOTH THE AIRPORT AND METRO SITES JUST UP THE ROAD HERE I WATCHED MEN AND WOMEN IN WHITE OVERALLS THIS MORNING HEADING DOWN INTO THE UNDERGROUND STATION
QUITE AN INCONGRUOUS SIGHT ACTUALLY SINCE THEY'RE USING A HOTEL AS THEIR BASE AND IN THAT HOTEL CONFERENCE DELEGATES AND TOURISTS WERE SITTING AROUND AT THE BAR LAST NIGHT CHATTING WHILE INVESTIGATORS WERE GOING ABOUT THEIR WORK THERE IS ALSO PLENTY OF WORK FOR EUROPE'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF COURSE AND WITH THE NEWS THIS MORNING THAT THE TWO MEN WHO ARE SUSPECTED OF BLOWING THEMSELVES UP AT THE AIRPORT YESTERDAY MORNING WERE KNOWN TO THE POLICE THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS FOR BELGIAN INTELLIGENCE TOO
WELL PETER TAYLOR IS A SECURITY EXPERT HE'S ALSO THE PRESENTER OF PANORAMA AND PETER GOOD MORNING YOU HAVE A PROGRAMME TONIGHT IN WHICH YOU ARE REVEALING HOW I S. FIGHTERS IN EUROPE ARE BEING EQUIPPED AND TRAINED THAT'S RIGHT MATTHEW SINCE LAST NOVEMBER SINCE THE PARIS ATTACKS WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATES NETWORK BEHIND THE PARIS ATTACKS AND CLEARLY THE NETWORK BEHIND
THE ATTACKS IN IN BRUSSELS YESTERDAY AND WE'VE SEEN MANY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS INDICATE THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR THERE WAS LITERALLY A LIFE AND DEATH RACE BETWEEN THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND ABBA OOD ABBOT LEWD BEING THE LEADER OF THE I S. NETWORK IN EUROPE WHO WAS SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED AFTER THE PARIS ATTACKS
AND THE INTELLIGENCE INDICATES THAT THIS RACE WAS GETTING EXTREMELY SERIOUS TOWARDS THE END OF LAST YEAR BEFORE THE PARIS ATTACKS WE SAW AN INTELLIGENCE REPORT THAT SAID THAT M.I.FIVE AND M.I.SIX MET WITH
PARTNER AGENCY OR EUROPEAN PARTNER AGENCY BECAUSE THEY WERE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT ABBOTT MOOD IN THE NETWORK AND IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THEY HAD RECEIVED IN AN INTELLIGENCE REPORT THAT HE WAS PREPARING TO SEND A SIXTY JIHADIST TO EUROPE
ANOTHER MEETING WAS THEN PLANNED BY OTHER AGENCIES TO SET UP A SPECIALIST TASK FORCE A SPECIALIST TEAM TO TARGET ABOUT RUDE THE TIMING OF THAT MEETING ORIGINALLY WAS TO TAKE PLACE TO FINALISE THE DETAILS ON THE THIRTEENTH OF NOVEMBER LAST YEAR WHICH OF COURSE AS YOU KNOW TRAGICALLY WAS THE DATE OF THE PARIS ATTACKS
AND HIS THIRD I MEAN HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER HOW WIDE THIS NETWORK IS IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S POTENTIALLY EXTREMELY WIDE I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY WIDE AND IF WE LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE PARIS ATTACKS IF WE LOOK AT THE ARREST OF AND ISLAM IF WE LOOK AT THE THE RESTS AND THE SHOOTING OF ANOTHER JIHAD IN
IN BRUSSELS LAST WEEK IT INDICATES THAT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK WHO HAVE THEY ARE STILL OUT THERE WHO ARE STILL POSING A THREAT WHEN ABBA OOD
BOASTED THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY SENT NINETY SUBSEQUENTLY NINETY JIHAD IS TO EUROPE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THAT'S PROPAGANDA BUT CLEARLY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE AND THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WERE KNOW ABOUT SOME OF THEM IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE ARREST OF THE TWO PEOPLE THIS MORNING WERE KNOWN TO THE POLICE THEY WERE FORMER PETTY CRIMINALS BUT THE POLICE DIDN'T IDENTIFY THEM THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM THE BELGIAN FACES
WELL QUITE A LET'S BRING IN DOCTOR PETER NEWMAN NOW DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE STUDY OF RADICALISATION I MEAN THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED ABOUT HOW THE BELGIAN AUTHORITIES ARE DEALING WITH THIS THREAT OUT THERE NOT YES AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE BELGIAN AND PRIORITIES WHERE THE FIRST ONES TO ADMIT THAT THEY WERE COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED
BELGIUM IS THE COUNTRY THAT PER CAPITA HAS RECRUITED THE MOST FOREIGN FIGHTERS THE MOST PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE TO SEE END IRAQ FIVE HUNDRED COMPARED TO FOR EXAMPLE EIGHT HUNDRED IN BRITAIN WHICH IS SIX TIMES THE POPULATION AND THEY HAVE SECURITY AGENCIES THAT ARE SIMPLY NOT BUILT FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE CONFRONTED WITH IT WASN'T NOT AT ALL I DON'T COME FOR THE NUM
SORRY NOT BUILT FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OR NOT BUILT FOR ACTUALLY GETTING INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND WORKING OUT WHO THE BAD EGGS ARE AND DEALING WITH I I THINK YOU YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S BOTH HAVE
THEY WERE NOT BUILT FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THEIR HISTORY CONFRONTED WITH THAT LARGE OF THE NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY VIOLENT EXTREMISTS BUT THE SAME TIME IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT PARTS OF BRUSSELS HAVE EFFECTIVELY BEEN ABANDONED BY THE STATE INCLUDING THE SECURITY AGENCIES
IT'S NOT NOT FOR YEARS MAYBE EVEN FOR DECADES I INTERVIEW THE FORMER HEAD OF BELGIANS EQUIVALENT OF M.I.FIVE
AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAD BEEN WARNING THE POLITICIANS THAT SECURITY SERVICE THE BELGIAN SECURITY SERVICE WAS UNDER FINANCED UNDER RESOURCED UNDERSTAFFED
AND THEY WARNED BACK TOWARDS THE END OF
WELL NOT LAST YEAR BUT IN THE END THEIR YEARS AND MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE PARIS ATTACKS
THEY WARNED ABOUT THE GROWING PROBLEM OF IS THE RADICALISATION BUT HE HE TOLD ME SO IT'S A LYTICO POLITICIANS DID NOT WANT TO KNOW THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN
THAT'S INTERESTING BUT PETER NEWMAN QUICKLY IT IS POLITICAL PROBLEM AND UNFORTUNATELY POLITICS MEANS THAT NOW THEY WILL PROBABLY GET THE MONEY THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT IT ALWAYS ONLY EVER HAPPENS AFTER SOMETHING
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER SEVEN A TAIL
WHAT INDEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WE'VE GOT A SLIGHT DELAY ON THE LINE WHICH IS COMPLICATED MY INTERVENTIONS BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BOTH OF YOU AND THERE IS MORE FROM PETER TAYLOR ON TONIGHT'S HOUR LONG EDITION OF PANORAMA THAT IS TONIGHT AT NINE O'CLOCK ON B.B.C. ONE THE TIME IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
AND WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS NOW WHICH ARE OF COURSE AS THEY ARE HERE IN BRUSSELS AND BELGIUM DOMINATED BY THE ATTACKS OF YESTERDAY THE INDEPENDENT DEVOTES ITS ENTIRE FRONT PAGE TO A PHOTO OF PASSENGERS EVACUATED FROM AN UNDERGROUND TRAIN AFTER THE METRO EXPLOSION TRUDGING THROUGH A TUNNEL TOWARDS THE LIGHT
DARKNESS IN THE HEART OF EUROPE IS ITS HEADLINE THE PAPER SAYS THAT IN ITS CHOICE OF TARGETS ISIS WAS ATTACKING INTERNATIONALISM AND THE EUROPEAN UNION IT ARGUES THAT THE MILITANTS CAN ONLY BE DEFEATED BY POLICE CO OPERATION AND INTELLIGENT SHARING ACROSS EUROPEAN FRONTIERS AND THAT THEME IS ECHOED IN AN EDITORIAL IN THE TIMES WHICH SAYS THAT TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES
SHOULD BE ALSO WILLING TO WORK WITH GOVERNMENTS AND SECURITY SERVICES IN SHARING INFORMATION THE THREAT OF TERROR IS GLOBAL AND COORDINATED THE PAPER SAYS
AND THE RESPONSE MUST BE AS WELL THE GUARDIAN BELIEVES THAT BRUSSELS MAY HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BECAUSE IT HAS FAIRLY OR UNFAIRLY THE REPUTATION OF BEING A WEAK LINK IN COUNTER TERRORISM BUT IT SAYS THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT ONE CITY EUROPE AS A WHOLE WILL NECESSARILY FEEL ALARMED
THE PAPER CALLS FOR COOL HEADS AND CRITICISES THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER MANUEL VOWELS FOR DESCRIBING THE BRUSSELS BOMBINGS AS ACTS OF WAR SUCH VOCABULARY AT ARGUES GIVES ISIS AND ENTIRELY UNWARRANTED LEGITIMACY BY CASTING IT ALMOST AS A STATE AND PLACES UNNECESSARY STRAINS ON EUROPE SOCIAL COHESION AND DEMOCRATIC FAB
A COUPLE OF THE PAPER'S RE PRINT A CARTOON THAT APPEARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA PORTRAYING BELGIUM'S MOST FAMOUS SON TINTIN WEEPING AS HE READS THE NEWS A CARTOON IN THE TIMES ADAPTS THE BELGIAN FLAG THE RIGHT HAND STRIPE IS BLOOD RED THE MIDDLE STRIPE OF YELLOW IS STAINED WITH BLOODY FOOTPRINTS AND A DARK CLOUD GUNMAN IS VANISHING INTO THE BLACK STRIPE ON THE
ELSEWHERE THE TELEGRAPH AS ONE OF A NUMBER OF PAPERS WHICH REPORTS ON RESEARCH APPARENTLY SHOWING THAT WOMEN SUFFER THE EFFECTS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE TO A GREATER DEGREE THE MEN THE STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE WORLD JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY SAYS MEN MEN CONSISTENTLY OUTPERFORM WOMEN AT THE SAME STAGE OF THE DISEASE IN TESTS INVOLVING THINKING AND LANGUAGE IT HASN'T BEEN ESTABLISHED BUT IT HASN'T ESTABLISHED A REASON ONE THEORY THERE IS THAT OLD MEN MAY HAVE GREATER MENTAL RESILIENCE BECAUSE THEY'VE OFTEN SPENT MORE TIME AT WORK THAN WOMEN
BRAINY AND BLONDE IS THE HEADLINE IN THE SUN ON A NEW AMERICAN STUDY REPORTED BY SEVERAL OF THE PAPERS IT'S FOUND THAT IN THE WORDS OF THE TIMES NOT ONLY IS THE DUMB BLONDE STEREOTYPE UNFAIR BUT BLONDE SEEM TO BE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THOSE WOMEN WITH OTHER PAIR COLOURS WOMEN WERE TESTED ON MATHS AND ENGLISH SKILLS BEFORE BEING ASKED TO REVEAL THEIR NATURAL HAIR COLOUR THOSE WITH FAIR HAIR EMERGED WITH MARGINALLY HIGHER RESULTS COMPELLING EVIDENCE ACCORDING TO THE LEAD RESEARCHER THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BASED ON THEIR INTELLIGENCE

ANGELA BARNES AS THEY SAY YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU WITH YOUR SERIES ON RADIO FOUR IS COMING UP IN AUGUST THERE'S A MONTH THOUGH IF YOU WANT TO GET TO SUBMIT YOUR ENTRIES TO THIS NEW COMEDIAN AWARD AND GOOD LUCK WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW AND IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN A CAMBRIDGE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND DOCTOR MICHAEL GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
IS I THINK A SAD TRUTH THAT THOUGH YESTERDAY'S DREADFUL ATROCITIES IN BRUSSELS SHOCK US THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SURPRISE US OF COURSE WE FIND IMAGES OF THE INJURED AND WOUNDED AND HAVE PEOPLE FLEEING IN PANIC AND THOUGHTS OF THE DEAD AND THEIR FAMILIES DISTRESSING
BUT WHILE THESE EVENTS MAY DISTRESS US THEY DON'T SURPRISE US AS IF COMING OUT OF THE BLUE FAR FROM IT WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT SUCH HAPPENINGS AS PART OF THE FABRIC OF MODERN LIFE SO WE DON'T ASK WHETHER THERE WILL BE ANOTHER TERRORIST INCIDENT WE ASK WHEN AND WHERE
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER AS A CHILD AT FOOTBALL MATCHES HEARING ANNOUNCEMENTS HAVE A BOMB SCARE OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER SYSTEM AND THE REQUEST THAT EVERYONE CHECK UNDER THEIR SEATS I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE HAS BEEN ANY TIME SINCE THEN WHEN THE EXPECTATION OF SUCH THREATS HAVE EVER GONE AWAY
IN THE STORY OF HOLY WEEK WHICH CHRISTIANS TELL GAME THIS WEEK THERE IS A PARTICULAR INCIDENT WHICH SPEAKS TO THE PRESUMPTION THAT VIOLENCE HAS AN ALMOST INEVITABLE PLACE IN OUR EXISTENCE THE GOSPELS REFER TO A CUSTOMER THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD RELEASE A PRISONER AT THE TIME OF THE PASSOVER FESTIVAL THE CHOICE IT SEEMS IS BETWEEN JESUS AND BARABBAS A BANDITS IN ONE VERSION IN ANOTHER ONE OF A GROUP OF MURDEROUS REBELS
AND WHEN THE PREVARICATING PILOT OFFERS THEM JESUS THAT CROWD SHOUT IN REPLY NOT THIS MAN BUT BARABBAS
THE GOSPELS DON'T REALLY EXPLAIN THIS PREFERENCE BUT MANY CHRISTIAN CONGREGATIONS WILL BE MADE TO PONDER IT FOR THEMSELVES THIS WEEK WHEN THEY WERE NOT SIMPLY LISTEN TO THESE STORIES BUT TAKE PART IN THEM HE WAS IN MANY PLACES A TRADITION OF DRAMATIC RENDITIONS OF THE GOSPELS IN WHICH CONGREGATIONS BECOME THE VOICE OF THE CROWD THEMSELVES YELLING NOT THIS MAN BUT BARABBAS
AND AS THEY FIND THESE WORDS ON THEIR OWN LIPS THEY WILL BE FORCED TO WONDER WHERE SUCH A CRY COMES FROM WHY IS EVIL CHOSEN OVER GOOD WHY IS A MURDERER PREFERRED TO THE INNOCENT AND PACIFIC JESUS
IF WE EXAMINE OURSELVES I EXPECT WE MAY FIND A SNEAKING OR NOT SO SNEAKING REGARD FOR THE MAN OF ACTION EVEN IF THE ACTION IS CRIMINAL AND COOL THINKING A CULTURE OF WHAT IS VERY OFTEN TANTAMOUNT TO THE CELEBRATION OF THE LIVES OF NOTORIOUS CROOKS SUCH AS THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERS NO MATTER THAT THEY WERE VIOLENT AND RUTHLESS
IT IS AS IF WE CAN'T QUITE RID OURSELVES OF THE THOUGHT THAT VIOLENCE REALLY DOES BELONG TO THE FABRIC OF THE WORLD THIS IS JUST THE WAY IT GOES BUT IT IS TO BE EXPECTED ALMOST ACCEPT IT OF COURSE HOLY WEEK INVITES US NOT JUST TO FACE UP TO THIS THOUGHT BUT TO CONFRONT IT AND REJECT IT
IT INVITES US NOT TO ACCEPT THE WORLD WE KNOW ONLY TOO WELL ONE CONSTRUCTED ACCORDING TO THE LOGIC OF VIOLENCE OF STRIKE AND COUNTER STRIKE OF GRIEVANCE AND RETALIATION WITH ALL ITS SORRY CONSEQUENCES
BUT TO IMAGINE A QUITE DIFFERENT WORLD FOUNDED ON FORGIVENESS RECONCILIATION AND PEACE
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR MICHAEL BANNER IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT
CHILDREN ARE BEING LEFT UNPROTECTED AND AT RISK OF SERIOUS HARM BECAUSE OF INCONSISTENCIES AND SHORTCOMINGS IN THE WAY THE POLICE DEAL WITH MISSING CHILDREN THE POLICE WATCHDOG INSPECTORATE OF CONSTABULARY SAYS POLICE FORCES OFTEN DON'T CATEGORISE THEM AS MISSING WHEN THEY SHOULD THEY UNDERESTIMATE THE RISKS THEY FACE AND THEY SEE CHILDREN WHO REPEATEDLY GO MISSING AS TIME WASTERS RATHER THAN VULNERABLE HERE'S WHAT THE WATCHDOG WAS TOLD BY A NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR DEALINGS WITH THE POLICE THEIR WORDS ARE SPOKEN BY ACTORS
THEY ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO ANSWER THIS SHOULD BE A BIT MORE SYMPATHETIC AND UNDERSTANDING THE UNDERESTIMATE HOW HARD IT WAS YOU'RE NERVOUS AND YOU'RE SCARED
THIS TAKE YOUR FEELINGS INTO CONSIDERATION THEY SHOULD TRY PUT THEMSELVES INTO YOUR SHOES ASK HOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FEELING DON'T BE SYMPATHETIC BE EMPATHETIC
DOES SHE CARE ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE THEY SHOULD MAKE YOU FEEL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS YOU THINK I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT SOMETHING'S ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF PEOPLE YOU NEVER SEEN BEFORE
IT'S EMBARRASSING AND I JUST FEEL EMBARRASSED THEY WERE NICE DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT THEY WERE JUST
THE WAY SOME OF THEM LOOKED AT YOU I FELT LIKE I WERE LIKE A PIECE OF ME
WE JOINED HER ON THE LINE FROM WESTMINSTER BY HER MAJESTY'S INSPECTORATE INSPECTOR OF CONSTABULARY WENDY WILLIAMS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND IT SEEMS ARE ACROSS THE BOARD A FAIRLY STRONG CRITICISM THAT YOU'RE MAKING OF THE WAY THAT THE POLICE DEAL WITH
YOUNG MISSING CHILDREN YES WE ASSESSED HOW EFFECTIVE THE POLICE WERE DEALING WITH CHILDREN WHO GO MISSING FROM HOME OR RESIDENTIAL CARE AND WE DID THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN
MISSING CHILDREN AND CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND ONCE WE WERE PLEASED TO FIND THAT MANY IF NOT MOST OFFICERS WERE WELL INTENTIONED AND THERE WERE EXAMPLES OF COMMITTED OFFICERS WHO WERE PROVIDING AN EXCELLENT RESPONSE NONETHELESS WE DID HAVE CONCERNS AND THE FIRST IS THAT THE SERVICE HASN'T FULLY APPRECIATED THE LINK BETWEEN MISSING CHILDREN AND SEE A SEA AND THERE'S A LACK OF ACCURATE DATA AND INTELLIGENCE SO YOU DON'T KNOW THE SCALE AND NATURE OF THE PROBLEM SO TRUG C.F.C. CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION THE IDEA THAT CHILDREN GO MISSING AND THEY THEN ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE
THAT'S RIGHT THEY COULD BE EXPOSED TO GROOMING TO EXPLOITATION TO TRAFFICKING TO GANG VIOLENCE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THORN ABILITIES THAT THESE CHILDREN FACE OH KAY AND YET IN TWO OFF AND THE POLICE ARE TREATING THEM AS TROUBLEMAKERS
YES WE DID SEE THAT THERE WERE SOME NEGATIVE ATTITUDES DISPLAYED BY THE POLICE ER TOWARDS MISSING CHILDREN OFTEN THEY DIDN'T FULLY RECOGNISE THE VULNERABILITY OF THESE CHILDREN AND I SUPPOSE IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT OFFICERS WOULD BE FRUSTRATED ESPECIALLY INTHE ENCASED CASES WHERE CHILDREN GO MISSING TIME AFTER TIME BUT HITS FOR THEM TO BE SKILLS AND TO RECOGNISE AND LOOK BEYOND THAT RECOGNISE THEIR VULNERABILITY AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AND BE AS WE'VE HEARD EMPATHETIC TRY AND ESTABLISH A RAPPORT
BUT THOSE THOSE CLIPS THAT WE HEARD FROM THAT IT WAS VOICED UP BY AN ACTOR AND BY TWO ACTORS BUT THEY WERE WHAT CHILDREN HAD SAID HOW WIDESPREAD WAS THAT SORT OF STORY
SADLY THAT DID THAT WAS THE BALANCE THE BALANCE WAS ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND WHAT WE ARE CALLING FOR IS FOR THE POLICE TO RECOGNISE THAT VULNERABILITY GET BEYOND THE ACTING OUT BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE CHILDREN MAY NOT RECOGNISE THAT THEY'RE VULNERABLE THEY MAY BE RUNNING FROM A PROBLEM THEY MAY BE RUNNING TO A PROBLEM AND IT'S FOR THE POLICE TO UNDERSTAND
ESTABLISH THAT RAPPORT AND GET THE CHILDREN TO DISCLOSE THOSE UNDERLYING CORSETS BECAUSE THAT WILL AVOID TO REPEAT OPPORTUNITY WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE BALANCE ARE YOU SAYING THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE
IT'S RUNAWAY GONE MISSING FOR SOME REASON WHO IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH THE POLICE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN DEALT WITH AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN GO MISSING THE UNIVERSITY OF BEDFORDSHIRE DID INTERVIEW A NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND CERTAINLY THE BALANCE OF THE UM THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE COURSE OF THAT EXERCISE WERE NEGATIVE WE CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND OF THOSE CHILDREN BUT CERTAINLY
ON THE BASIS OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE POLICE DO HAVE TO BE BETTER AT RECOGNISING SIGNED OFF ON THE VILLA SEE DEALING WITH THAT VULNERABILITY AND IDENTIFYING THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF WHY IT IS THAT CHILDREN GO MISSING SO THAT THEY CAN PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING IN FUTURE THE HOME OFFICE HAS GIVEN A RESPONSE TO YOUR REPORT AND THEY SAY THAT THEY WELCOME THE SCRUTINY IN THE HOPE OR FOUR FORCES COULD CLOSELY CONSIDER THEIR FINDINGS AND CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE
AND THEY'RE REVIEWING THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GOVERNMENT ALMOST SOUNDS THERE IS IF YOU'RE ASKING IT'S A PLEAD TO POLICE OFFICERS JUST TO HAVE A MORE HUMAN REACTION TO INDIVIDUALS AND DIFFICULT SITUATION YES WERE CALLING FOR A NUMBER OF ASPECTS THE FIRST IS A NATIONAL DATABASE OF MISSING CHILDREN SO THAT ALL THE AGENCIES NOT JUST THE POLICE BUT ALSO LOCAL AUTHORITIES CAN START TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SYSTEMATICALLY
AND THERE NEEDS TO BE AN IMPROVED AND JOINED UP SYSTEM OF ASSESSING THE PROBLEM BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE POLICE BUT FINALLY THAT DOES NEED TO BE BETTER TRAINING AND AWARENESS OF OFFICERS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO COME INTO CONTACT WITH CHILDREN RECOGNISING THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT THEY'RE VULNERABLE SO THAT THEY CAN ENCOURAGE THEIR CHILDREN TO SHARE INFORMATION WHICH THEY CAN USE TO PROTECT THEM KEEP THEM SAFE AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN IN FUTURE WENDY WILLIAMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

DAVID CAMERON WILL CHAIR A MEETING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S EMERGENCY COBRA COMMITTEE LATER THIS MORNING TO CONSIDER SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS HERE BRITAIN IS SENDING A TEAM OF SPECIALIST POLICE OFFICERS TO BRUSSELS TO HELP WITH THE INVESTIGATION A ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH REPORT
THE VIEW OF MINISTERS IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE ALERT BUT NOT ALARMED SOURCES SAY THERE SO FAR NO EVIDENCE OF ANY DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THE BRUSSELS ATTACK AND AN IMMINENT TERRORIST THREAT TO BRITAIN AND NO NEED TO INCREASE THE THREAT LEVEL WHICH REMAINS AT SEVERE THIS MORNING THE PRIME MINISTER WILL REVIEW SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS BUT POLICE PATROLS HAVE ALREADY BEEN STEPPED UP AT MAJOR TRANSPORT HUBS
AN ADDITIONAL BORDER CONTROLS BAGGAGE AND CAR CHECKS INTRODUCED AT PORTS AND AIRPORTS MEANWHILE THERE'S LIKELY TO BE FURTHER CONTROVERSY TODAY OVER REMARKS BY SENIOR YOU KEPT POLITICIANS LINKING THE BRUSSELS BOMBINGS XHALAX Y. U. MIGRATION RULES LAST NIGHT THE PARTY'S LEADER NIGEL FARAGE SAID THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE MEANS THE FREE MOVEMENT OF KALASHNIKOVS
BOTH THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE HOME SECRETARY HAVE URGED POLITICIANS NOT TO USE THE BRUSSELS ATTACK TO FURTHER ARGUMENTS IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
THE FUTURE OF ONE OF THE U.K.'S BEST KNOWN HIGH STREET NAMES B.H.S. WILL BE DECIDED TODAY WHEN ITS CREDITORS VOTE ON WHETHER TO BACK A RESCUE DEAL WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT THE COMPANY WHICH HAS BEEN MAKING A LOSS FOR SEVERAL YEARS MAY GO INTO ADMINISTRATION PUTTING MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND JOBS AT RISK AND AS A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JONTY BLOOME REPORT TODAY'S MADE COULD ALSO HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THOUSANDS OF FORMER STAFF IN THE COMPANY'S PENSION SCHEME
UNTIL LAST YEAR B.H.S. WAS OWNED BY SIR PHILIP GREEN BUT AFTER YEARS OF LOSSES HE SOLD IT FOR JUST ONE POUND TO RETAIL ACQUISITIONS IT'S NOW SEEKING A COMPANY VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT WHICH MEANS SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF ITS CREDITORS HAVE TO VOTE IN FAVOUR OF A SCHEME TO PROTECT THE COMPANY WHILE HE TRIES TO TURN ITSELF AROUND AND IN PARTICULAR WE NEGOTIATE THE RENTS OF MANY OF ITS STORES WHICH IT CLAIMS ARE FAR TOO HIGH
BUT EVEN IF IT WINS APPROVAL FOR THIS C.V. EH THE COMPANY IS FAR FROM SAFE AND IT HAS A HUGE HOLE IN ITS PENSION FUND OF SOME FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN TO HAVE TO BE BAILED OUT BY THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND THAT WOULD MEAN CUTS OF AROUND TEN PER CENT IN THE PENSIONS OF TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THE P. P. F. AS EXPECTED TO SEE TENS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS FROM SIR PHILIP GREEN THE FORMER OWNER OF B.H.S. TO HELP PLUG THAT GAP
THE FRONT RUNNERS IN THE RACES FOR THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE WON THEIR PARTIES PRIMARIES IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA BERNIE SANDERS HAS WON THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCASUS IN EITHER AT HOME BOTH MY TRUMPET AND MISSUS CLINTON LOOK LIKELY TO LOSE THEIR CAUCUSES IN UTAH WHERE TED CRUISE AND BERNIE SANDRA'S HOLD CLEAR LEADS
A REVIEW EXAMINING HOW SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HANDLED ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION INCLUDING THE ABUSE OF HUNDREDS OF GIRLS IN ROTHERHAM HAS FOUND THAT A LACK OF INTEREST BY SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS LED TO REPEATED FAILURES TO INVESTIGATE BEFORE SAYS IT'S MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN TACKLING EXPLOITATION AND GROOMING BUT HE'D ACCEPT THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE
PREVIOUS REPORTS OF DETAILED THE SCALE OF THE ABUSE AND THE FAILINGS OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL BUCHANAN REPORTS FROM SHEFFIELD
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE FAILURE TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM SEXUAL ABUSE HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED THIS INDEPENDENT REPORT CONDUCTED FOR THE EARLIEST POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONER LOOKED INTO WHY THE FORCEFIELD TO ACT PARTICULARLY IN RATHER ROTHERHAM BUT ALSO IN SHEFFIELD IT SAYS THAT FOR A DECADE FROM TWO THOUSAND SENIOR OFFICERS WEREN'T INTERESTED IN CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION
SOMETIMES VIEWING IT AS A BIRD AND JUNIOR OFFICERS FOUNDED WELL NIGH IMPOSSIBLE SIR IS THAT A VIEW TO GET SUPPORT DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE THE FORCE PLACED ON CAR CRIME BURGLARY AND ROBBERY NATIONAL POLICING PRIORITIES AT THE TIME
TODAY'S REPORT SAYS THE FORCE HAS MARKEDLY IMPROVED ITS INVESTIGATION OF CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION SAS TWENTY THIRTEEN BUT THE CHALLENGE IS INCREASING THE FORCE HAS RECEIVED ALLEGATIONS OF NEARLY TWO HUNDRED RAPES ARE ATTEMPTED RAPES OF CHILDREN OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
PLANT SCIENTISTS FEAR THE ASH TREE WILL BE WIPED OUT IN EUROPE AS TREES ARE BEING KILLED BY FUNGAL DISEASE ASH DIEBACK AND ATTACKS BY THE EMERALD ASH BORE A BEETLE WHICH HASN'T YET REACHED THE U.K. THE MAN BEHIND THE RESEARCH WHICH IS PUBLISHED TODAY IN THE JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY IS DOCTOR PETER THOMAS FROM KEELE UNIVERSITY HE TOLD US SCIENTISTS MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONTAIN THE BEETLE
BUT THE FUNGUS WAS HERE TO STAY THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS THAT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR ASH TREES WILL SUCCUMB TO THE DISEASE MAY TAKE TWENTY YEARS TO DIE BUT DIE THEY WELL I MEAN THERE ARE A FEW THINGS WEEK WE CAN WORK TOWARDS SOMETHING LIKE ABOUT ONE PER CENT OF THE ASH TREES ARE LIKELY TO BE IMMUNE OR NOT IMMUNE RESISTANT TO THE DISEASE AND IF WE CAN TAKE THOSE AND BREED FROM THEM THEN WE CAN EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY REPOPULATE BRITAIN WITH ASHTRAYS
DOCTOR PETER THOMAS SUITS JUST COMING UP TO TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT HERE IN BRUSSELS WE ARE LEARNING A LITTLE MORE THIS MORNING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO CARRIED OUT YESTERDAY'S ATTACKS TWO BROTHERS KNOWN TO THE POLICE HERE CAN LEAD AND IBRAHIM HELD BACK CRAWL WE WHO BLEW THEMSELVES UP AT THE AIRPORT
AND THE MAN STILL ON THE RUN IS BEING NAMED LOCALLY AS LATERAL WI THE HUNT FOR HIM CONTINUES IT IS
A RATHER SORRY SIGHT HERE JUST ACROSS FROM ME IN CENTRAL BRUSSELS THIS MORNING THERE'S A LIGHT DRIZZLE FALLING ON THE FLOWERS AND THE CANDLES LEFT BY THE MANY PEOPLE WHO GATHERED HERE YESTERDAY EVENING AND THAT DRIZZLE IS STARTING TO FADE THE VIBRANT COLOURS OF THE WORDS CHALKED INTO THE PAVING STONES
MOST OF THOSE WORDS ARE MESSAGES OF HOPE WE ARE UNITED BRUSSELS MY BEAUTIFUL CITY AND THE LIKE BUT ONE THAT STOOD OUT TO ME ALSO SCRATCHED ONTO THE PAVING IN CHALK SHAPER I'M AFRAID
I'M NOT SCARED AT ALL BUT IT'S ME I'M I'M ANGRY BUT

MAKE SURE YOUR DEBTS THINGS GET BETTER AND THAT WE CAN PREVENT THOSE THINGS IN THE FUTURE
YOU'RE CLUTCHING YOUR ORANGE CHALK HAVE YOU WRITTEN ANYTHING YET YEAH I WROTE TO BOOK THE SAID MY BEN MY BEAUTIFUL BRUSSELS YES
WHY DID YOU COME DOWN I THINK FOR ME THIS IS MAYBE JUST A SORT OF SMALL MESSAGE BUT IF YOU LOOK AROUND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES READING IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE I'VE SEEN AND I THINK IT'S A NICE GESTURE JUST TOO SO THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO LIVE TO GET BRUSSELS AS I HAS ALWAYS BEEN
I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES BIT LIVING TOGETHER AND IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN RECKON SO FAR FOR IT AGES N. YEARS
AND I THINK IT'S STILL POSSIBLE IF EVERYBODY STAYS LEG THEY ARE AND NOT START TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS BECAUSE OF
WITH THINGS THAT HAPPENED TODAY AND THIS SMALL GESTURE CAN HELP ON THAT I'M JUST WANDERING THROUGH THE CROWD
JUST WALKING THROUGH TO THE PART OF THE PAVEMENT WHERE A COUPLE OF BELGIAN FLAGS THAT RED YELLOW AND BLACK HAD BEEN LAIN THEM OUNCE AND ON TOP OF THEM
AND ALSO HAVE BEEN LICKED PEOPLE PUTTING DOWN BUNCHES OF FLOWERS OTHERS STANDING AND LOOKING
IT'S IT WAS IMPORTANT TO COME INTO A SYMBOLIC MISSY TO BE HERE IN THE CENTRAL LINE
I THINK THE ONE THING WE HAVE TO DO IS TO TO TO BE HERE TO TALK AND TO BE TOGETHER
TO BE FREE WE HAVE TO STAY FREE THAT'S THE FIRST THING THEY DON'T WANT US TO BE FREE I JUST TO VIEW ITS UDDER
DREW PEOPLE FROM PRISON SHE LOADS AND I JUST WANTED TO BE HERE
ALL DAY LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE I WAS JUST IN MY HOME IS A WAS GOOGLY EVERYONE IN THOUGH
IT WAS HERE THAT JUST WHAT THEY WANT
NO ONE WANTS TO DO A DEAL I WANT US TO DO IT

WE'RE GOING TO EXAMINE PERHAPS WHAT THIS STRANGE PHENOMENON IS AND ITS ROOTS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MOMENTS WITH ME HIS ASTHMA WHO LIVES IN MULLEN BAKE WHICH AS WE KNOW HAS BECOME THE SORT OF FOCAL POINT IF YOU LIKE
IN THE HUNT FOR A LOT OF THESE RADICALISED INDIVIDUALS AND ASTHMA YOU ALSO KNEW ONE OF THE PARIS ATTACKERS SULLA ABD AL SALAM BEFORE HE WAS RADICALISED HE WAS ARRESTED HERE IN BELGIUM LAST WEEK WHO WAS FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND HE WAS NORMAL HE WAS A NORMAL PERSON HE WAS A KIND PERSON WHO WAS I THINK NORMAL FOR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
BECAUSE THEY WERE WE WERE LIVING TOGETHER NO CHOICE VERT BY THERE SO SHE'S OFF
NORMAL AND KINDA PROBABLY NOT THE WORDS THAT PEOPLE WOULD USE ABOUT HIM NOW WHEN DID YOU KNOW HIM HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT WHEN HE WAS A KID SO I DID IT LAST TIME I SAW HIM HE DOES BECAUSE HE MET JILL SHOES BECAUSE HE WASN'T COMING AND WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK
LED HIM TO CHANGE THIS IS THIS SEEMS TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION AT THE MOMENT WHAT LEAD PEOPLE LIKE HIM TO
FIRST THINK HE WENT TO JAIL FOR A CREW FIRST MORE CRIMINAL ACTS THERE HE MET A BOLD ONE WAS RADICALISED IN THAT HE WAS A TERRORIST AND I THINK THERE ISN'T ANY SOCIAL WORKERS
IAN FOR ENGEAL THERE IS AND IF PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE PRETTY GOOD YOU CAN SHOW THEM THE GOOD WAY SO WHEN THEY GO TO JAIL HERE IN BRUSSELS THE COM BACK FROM THEY'RE WORSE THAN THEY WERE
BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY BODIES WHAT IS GOING ON COMMUNITIES PROBABLY TOO BIG A WORD COS IT'S NOT THE COMMUNITY IT IS INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN MODERN BAKE AND IN OTHER PLACES IN OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE SUBURBS OF PARIS IN THERE LIKE THAT THAT HE'S LEADING T. TO YOUNG MEN TO BECOME SO RADICALISED THAT THEY WILL CARRY OUT SUCH MURDEROUS
I THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM OF IDENTITY HERE IN EUROPE IN GENERAL BECAUSE THEY TELL TO PEOPLE TO HIDE THEIR THERE'S BELIEVES SO THE TWO PERSONS WHISKERS ARE PHRENIC THERE YOU GO TO SCHOOL THERE ARE PRISON THEY CAN SHOW THEIR OPINION ABOUT SOME FACT
DAD THERE ARE SOMEONE ELSE IN PRIVATE THEY GET RADICALISED IN PRIVATE FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE COURSES OFFER RELIGION AT SCHOOL SO IT'S MEANS EVERYBODY'S GONE ER STUDIED TO RELIGION IN PRIVATE
I SHOULD SAY YOU'RE WEARING A HEAD SCARF YOU'RE A YOUNG MUSLIM WOMAN IN THIS CITY DO YOU DO YOU FEEL PART OF THIS CITY DO YOU FEEL PART OF BELGIAN SOCIETY TOTALLY I THINK BRUSSELS IS AN AMAZING LABORATORY OF DIFFERENT CULTURES THERE FOR AN AND IS IT WILL BE AMAZING BUT BUT BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE GETTING LEFT BEHIND WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS SOCIETY PERHAPS THAT
THEY ALL SOME RADICALISM I THINK THEY'VE GOT TO FORGET HOW TO DEAL WITH HIS WITH HIS HISTORY WITH HIT IT'S THREE ACTUALLY ONE DAY THEY WANTED TO MOROCCO HAS TO AWARD THAT'S TO COME HERE AND WORK IN MINES AND THEY FEEL THAT THEY WILL GO BACK THEY THEY THEIR THEIR CHILDREN WANT TO STUDY AHA YOU THEY WANT THE GRADUATED ONE DAY SO THEY WANNA QUANTAS TO ENTERING INTO A COMPANY
THEY JUST WANT US TO BE IN THEIR SHADOW OF ASSOCIATING OH ASTHMA THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US LET ME BRING IN MAJOR SAGE THROW BUNS HE'S A BELGIAN SECURITY AND DEFENCE EXPERT AND YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IN BRUSSELS IN EUROPE FOR THE INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMICS AND PEACE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
YOU HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING THERE WHAT DID YOU THINK IS FUELLING THIS RADICALISM AND HAVE THE BELGIAN AUTHORITIES GOT A GRIP ON
FOR THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION WHAT IS FUELLING THIS IS IN FACT WHAT SHE EXPLAINED IT'S A YOUNG
YOUNG PEOPLE YOUNG MEN BUT ALSO YOUNG GIRLS THAT DO NOT FEEL A SENSE OF ACCEPTANCE WITHIN OUR SOCIETY
I DO NOT FEEL THEY FIT IN THEIR SOCIETY AND THEN IT'S JUST CREATIVE FRUSTRATION THIS CREATES AN EMPTINESS INSIDE THAT THE RECORD TO SEND THE RADICALISE US I REALLY HAPPY TO FEEL BUT THIS IS NOT THE PROBLEM ONLY A HORSE OF SIGHT IT'S ALSO A PROBLEM OFF THE SITUATION ALL OVER THE WORLD I MEAN INTERVENTION SOMETIME OF CONFLICT TWO ASIAN IN THE MIDDLE EAST
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND PALESTINE ALSO FURIOUS FOR RADICALISATION
THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION IS THE BELGIAN AUTHORITIES ON TOP READ YES I THINK SO YEAH I THINK THEY'RE ON TOP OF IT THERE BUT THE PROBLEM IS AND A LOT OF EFFORT'S I'VE I DONE ALSO PER FIBROTIC ISATION TO TO SUPPORT INTEGRATION
WE DID THE BELGIANS OR SIDE BEEN COMING OVER FROM THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT AND ALSO FROM THE FROM THE E.U. BUT THIS IS THE PROBLEM GOING TO SOLVE IN A COUPLE OF THESE NOT EVEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS I WAS BEING TOLD YESTERDAY THAT ACTUALLY THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH IN THE WAY OF EFFORTS TO STOP RADICALISATION OR AT LEAST TO REINTEGRATE
YOUNG MEN WHO HAD BEEN RADICALISED BACK INTO SOCIETY BUT WELL YOU KNOW IT ALL WRONG ALL ACROSS EUROPE
THOSE THAT RETURNED FROM FROM CEREAL IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT FOR INSTANCE IN BELGIUM OF THE MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS THERE IS A SOLO AGAINST RADICALISATION OF DEALING WITH IT WOOD
THEY'RE WORKING WITH ALL THE REGIONS IN BELGIANS WITH THE WITH THE COMMUNITIES IN BELGIUM TODAY ARE FINANCING PROGRAMMES SO THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS GONE THE BOTH RADICALISATION I MEAN THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED
OF COURSE THERE WAS A QUIFF THAT IS ASIAN AREA WITHIN WRESTLES THE MAJOR CITY IN BELGIUM BUT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM ONLY FOR FOR BRUSSELS NOT ONLY FROM BELGIUM AND I'M NOT EVEN ON BEFORE FOR EUROPE THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM ONLY FOUR BUT IT'S LOCATED THE IN THE CITY AND A VERY BRIEF ANSWER ARE YOU WORRIED DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO ESCALATE
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO ESCALATE EVERY TIME SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN WE WERE JUST FINDING THE VERY QUICK WAY THE PERPETRATORS AND SO WE ARE ACTIVE WHEN I SEE WE KNEW THE SECURITY FORCES IN EUROPE
ACTIVE CHEATING HIM ACT DEFRAUDING UP THOSE STUFFED NETWORKS IN THOSE SLEEPING CELLS BUT THIS NEEDS TIME THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN YOU CAN SOLVE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS MAJOR SAYS THROW BUNS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT'S NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT WHAT ABOUT THE U.K. HOW SHOULD WE REACT TO WHAT HAPPENED IN BRUSSELS IF WHICH SHOULD REACT AT ALL THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE CHAIRING A MEETING OF THE COBRA EMERGENCY COMMITTEE LATER TODAY RICHARD BARRETT USED TO HEAD UP GLOBAL COUNTER TERRORISM OPERATIONS FOR M.I.SIX WARNED THAT SOMETHING SIMILAR COULD HAPPEN HERE
CLEARLY THE SECURITY SERVICES IN LONDON AND THE POLICE IN LONDON A BIGGER BETTER RESOURCED AND PAT AND PROBABLY MORE ON TO THE PROBLEM BUT ALL THE SAME WE HAVE HAD ATTACKS IN LONDON LAST MAJOR ATTACK BEFORE PARIS WAS OF COURSE THE SEVEN SEVEN ATTACK IN LONDON AND I'M SURE THAT THE POLICE SERVICES THE SCOURGE SERVICE WOULD ADMIT THAT YOU ARE SURE IT COULD VERY EASILY HAPPEN HERE
DEPUTY ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER NEIL BUT IS FROM THE U.K.'S COUNTERTERRORISM POLICING NETWORK AND JOINS US NOW FROM WESTMINSTER GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING COULD IT VERY EASILY HAPPEN HERE
I THINK THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION TO ANSWER AND WE WOULD NEVER BE COMPLACENT AND I WOULDN'T PATRONISE THE GREAT BRITISH PUBLIC BY SAYING THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE COURSE OCCURRED WE'VE BEEN AT THE THREAT LEVEL OF SEVERE SINCE AUGUST TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE'RE NEVER COMPLACENT WE'VE GOT A VERY FINE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE SERVICE AND OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT HAS BEEN FORGED OVER DECADES OF FIGHTING TERRORISM WHICH MEANS THAT WE'VE MANAGED TO STOP SEVEN PLOTS OVER THE LAST JUST OVER TWELVE MONTHS
WE'VE ASSISTED HIM DISRUPTING PLOTS OVERSEAS AS WELL SO YES IT COULD HAPPEN BUT WE WERE WORKING AT A GREAT PACE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T AND THOSE SEVEN PLOTS THAT YOU STOPPED IN THE LAST OVER THE LAST YEAR WHAT SORT OF SCALE WERE THEY
WELL YOU'VE SEEN TERRORIST NOW OIL WILLING TO ATTACK CROWDED PLACES SOFT CIVILIAN TARGETS YOU'VE SEEN THE KIND OF TARGETING THAT'S HAPPENED GLOBALLY AGAINST MILITARY AND POLICE ALL OF THESE PLOTS THROUGH OH VERY SIMILAR NATURE AND SCALE AND WE HAVE TRIALS ONGOING AT THE MOMENT
WHICH WHICH DEMONSTRATE THAT SO THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PHENOMENON AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WORKING VERY VERY HARD TO STOP O.K. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT THE TRIALS YOUR YOUR WHAT YOU NOW PLAN FOR IS AN EVENT ON THE SCALE OF PARIS RATHER THAN TWO SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THESE SEVEN PLOTS BEING OF A SCALE OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN BRUSSELS AND PARIS
THEY WON'T BE THERE BE A VARIETY OF METHODS IMPOSSIBLE WHAT I WOULD SAY AS WE'VE LEARNT A GREAT DEAL AND IF WE GO BACK NOT JUST TO PARIS IN NOVEMBER BUT IF WE GO BACK RIGHT TO MUMBAI WE'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS KIND OF ATTACK FOR A VERY LONG TIME PARIS WAS A GAME CHANGER FOR EUROPE THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT INCREASING CAPACITY
BUT WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST CAPABILITY THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED POST MUMBAI IN TERMS OF OUR OWN POLICING AND IN TERMS OF OUR INVESTIGATIVE ASAD AND HOW WE GO ABOUT STOPPING THESE PLOTS FROM DEVELOPING IN THE FIRST PLACE DONALD TRUMP WAS INTERVIEWED BY PIERS MORGAN ON I.T.V.'S GOOD MORNING PROGRAMME THIS MORNING AND HE SAID THAT BRITISH MUSLIMS WERE ABSOLUTELY NOT REPORTING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS
IS THAT RIGHT NO HE'S WRONG SO I THINK IT'S THERE'S A GENERATIONAL PROBLEM HERE THOSE WITHOUT A DOUBT WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE MORE REPORTING FROM THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND FROM ALL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE UNLIKE IN SOME OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD WE DO HAVE INTEGRATED COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE PEOPLE LIVING SIDE BY SIDE AND IF WE IF WE SORT OF DEMONISE ONE SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT IS THE WORST THING WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT ABSOLUTELY PLAYING INTO THE TERRACE HANDS OF MAKING PEOPLE
PHIL HATES HIM WE'D SEE WHEN EVENTS LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN BRUSSELS AND PARIS VERY UNFORTUNATE WE DO SEE A SPIKE IN HATE CRIME AND WE WILL DEAL WITH THAT VERY FORCIBLY WE DON'T WANT THAT HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE AND CONFIDENT TO COME FORWARD TO THE POLICE AND REPORT WHAT THEY HAVE TO REPORT ARE YOU NERVOUS GIVEN WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID SINCE THE ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS OF A SPIKE IN HATE CRIMES
WASTE WE SEE THAT WE ABSOLUTELY SEE THAT HAPPENING AND WE ALL OF THEIR COMMANDERS ACROSS THE U.K. ARE AWARE THAT THESE THINGS CAN HAPPEN WE ARE VERY CLOSE
CONTACTS WITH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT BRITISH POLICING IS FOUNDED ON A TRADITION OF COMMUNITY POLICING WE'VE KEPT THAT GOING OVER MANY YEARS AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO GIVE PEOPLE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY CAN REPORT THESE THINGS WHEN THEY HAPPEN AND THEY WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY THE POLICE MATE ABSOLUTELY WILL BE BUT WHAT I'M APPEALING TO THE PUBLIC TO DO IS THEY ARE OUR EYES AND EARS IF YOU SEE THINGS THAT ARE SUSPICIOUS YOU MUST REPORT
WE HAVE AN ANTI TERRORIST HOTLINE WHICH HAS SINCE IT WAS SET UP A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HAS GONE FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH IT'S OH EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN EIGHT NINE THREE TO ONE HOW EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN EIGHT NINE THREE TWO ONE AND WE WOULD ADVISE THE PUBLIC THAT THEY SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES WITHIN THEIR WORK PLACE WITHIN THE PLACES THAT THEY SOCIALISE OR TRANSPORT THEY MUST REPORT TO US
NEIL BASS OOH DEPUTY ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND BEFORE WE MOVE ON WE DO NOW HAVE A CLEAR THAT CLIP THAT I WAS REFERRING TO OF DONALD TRUMP HE SPOKE TO HIS FRIEND PIERS MORGAN DONALD TRUMP OF COURSE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE AT THE SEA HE SMOTE HIM ON I.T.V.'S GOOD MORNING BRITAIN AND HE ASKED HE ASKED PIERS MORGAN ASKED HIM ABOUT THE BRUSSELS BOMBING IN THE RECENTLY CAPTURED PARIS SHOOTING SUSPECTS A LAB ABTA SALAM AND THIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID
EVERYBODY KNEW HE WAS THERE EVERYBODY FROM THAT AREA NO HE WAS THERE NOBODY TURNED HER MEN THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG YOU KNOW APPEARS AND SOLD WORK WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID DONALD IS THEY BELIEVE YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY ANTI MUSLIM ARE YOU ANTI MUSLIM
ANYTHING I'M JUST COMMON SENSE I MEAN I JUST SAY IT LIKE IT IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF CONCERN IT I THINK THE WAY IT WAS CHARACTERISED WAS THAT YOUR CALL FOR MUSLIMS TO BE BANNED BANNED EFFECTIVELY MEANT THAT YOU WERE RACES THAT YOU WERE ANTI MUSLIMS PER SE IF THERE ARE BRITISH MUSLIMS WATCHING THIS INTERVIEW NOW THEY'LL BE PROBABLY HAVING THAT VIEW OF THE YOUTH FROM WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN AND HER BECAUSE YOU'VE NOT GIVEN A MAJOR INTERVIEW UNTIL NOW
WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO BRITISH MUSLIMS WHO ARE LAW ABIDING WHO ARE NOT VIOLENT AND WHO ARE AS HORRIFIED BY WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN BRUSSELS AND PARIS AND INDEED IN LONDON AS WE ARE
WELL I SAY STAY THE COURSE AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR MUSLIMS I HAVE MANY FRIENDS THAT ARE MUSLIMS I'M JUST SAYING THERE WAS SOMETHING WITH THE RADICALISED PORTION THAT IS VERY VERY BAD AND VERY DANGEROUS
YOU GO DONALD TRUMP'S VIEWS AS EXPRESSED WHILE TALKING TO PIERS MORGAN IT IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND ROB'S BACK AGAIN WITH THE SPORT MORNING
I THINK IT'S ABOUT AN HOUR TO GO BEFORE THE START OF ENGLAND AGAINST AFGHANISTAN IN THE MEN'S T. TWENTY IN DELHI ALEX HALES HOPES TO BE FIT FOR ENGLAND BUT THE WORD FROM CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN AGNEW IS THAT A CHANGE TO THE TEAM THAT BEAT SOUTH AFRICA IN THEIR LAST MATCH LOOKS LIKELY I THINK ENGLAND WILL MAKE A CHANGE I HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE I THINK PROBABLY RHYS TOPLIS I WILL HAVE TO STEP DOWN FOR NOW SO I CAN IMAGINE THEM GOING FOR A BIT OF PACE MAYBE LIAM PLUNKETT IF THEY DON'T PLAY DAWSON WHO IS VAIN EXPERIENCES LEAD NO INTERNATIONAL CRICKET BEFORE
COMMENTARY ON FIVE LIVE SPORTS EXTRA THEY'RE ON THE AIR AT NINE FIFTEEN ALSO TODAY THE START OF FOOTBALL'S WOMEN SUPER LEAGUE WHICH CURIOUSLY HAS AN ODD NUMBER OF TEAMS NINE BIDDING AT THE FIXTURE LIST PERMITS ONE TEAM PER ROUND OF MATCHES OF WHICH THERE ARE SIXTEEN OVER A PERIOD OF THIRTY TWO WEEKS IN SHORT THE FIXTURE LIST LEX COHERENT STRUCTURE AND REGULARITY WITH SOME CLUBS WITHOUT A GAME FOR AS LONG AS A MONTH IT'S A BIG TALK TALKING POINT YOU MIGHT IMAGINE ACKNOWLEDGED BY MANCHESTER CITY'S IZZY CHRISTIANSEN WHO'S BEEN FORCED TO PULL OUT OF TODAY'S OPENER AGAINST NOTTS COUNTY
AS A PLAYER IT'S OBVIOUSLY FRUSTRATING KNOWING THAT THAT ONE TEAM WON'T BE PLAYING EACH WEEK AND WEIGHT THAT WILL BE US HOWEVER I THINK I'VE RECEIVED THE LEA IS PROGRESSING BY THE YEAR AND I THINK THAT THE SEA HAVING NINETEENS AND THIS YEAR IS JUST A NATIVE PROGRESSION RATHER THAN A BARRIER IF YOU LIKE YES NEVERTHELESS IT'S A GREAT WAY OF SUSTAINING MOMENTUM IN THE WOMEN'S GAME AFTER THE WORLD CUP IS IT WHEN THE FIXTURE THERE SEEMS TO BE SO ARBITRARY REALLY
I THINK I THINK OBVIOUSLY V. IS IT'S A VERY CAREFUL PROCESS IN PROGRESS IN THE LEAGUE AND I THINK
SINCE THE WORLD CUP ENTHUSIASM AND THE LOVE THE WOMEN'S GAME IT HAS GONE ON THROUGH THE ROOF AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE AT ALL GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEY'RE THE SCHEDULING IS A LITTLE BIT HILD HIGGLEDY PIGGLEY IF YOU LIKE I THINK IT'S A BIT MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT HE'LL BE PIGGLEY IT'S A BIT OF A SHAMBLES ISN'T IT REALLY I THINK ARE JUST FOR PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW AS A PLAYER IT'S A FRUSTRATING KNOWING THAT THERE'S AN ODD NUMBER OF TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE IN FOR ME I THINK THAT THE SCENE AS THAT TENDS TO AN EVEN NUMBER

LIBBY THANK YOU VERY QUICK LOOK AT THE WEATHER LARGELY DRY AND SETTLED TODAY BUT WET AND WINDY
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH MATTHEW PRICE AND BRUSSEL SARAH MONTAGUE IN LONDON AND TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE ARE SOME OF THE NEWS FROM NEIL SLATE THE BELGIAN PUBLIC BROADCASTER AUNTIE B.F. IS REPORTING THAT TWO OF THE MEN WHO CARRIED OUT THE SUICIDE BOMBINGS OF BRUSSELS AIRPORT YESTERDAY WERE BROTHERS AND KNOWN TO THE POLICE THEY'VE BEEN NAMED AS HARLAND AND BRAHIM MELBA A WEEK A THIRD MAN IS ON THE RUN
THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE DIED AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OTHERS WERE WOUNDED IN THE BLAST OF THE AIRPORT AND AT A METRO STATION THE FOREIGN OFFICE IS WARNED PEOPLE TRAVELLING TO BELGIUM TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND KEEP AWAY FROM CROWDED PLACES DAVID CAMERON WILL CHAIR A MEETING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S EMERGENCY COMMITTEE THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS HOW TO RESPOND TO THE ATTACKS
THE FUTURE OF B.H.S. WILL BE DECIDED TODAY WHEN ITS CREDITORS VOTE ON WHETHER TO BACK A RESCUE DEAL WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT THE TRAIN MAY GO INTO ADMINISTRATION
A REVIEW EXAMINING HOW SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HANDLED ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION INCLUDING THE ABUSE OF AT LEAST FOURTEEN HUNDRED GIRLS IN RATHER UM OVER SIXTEEN YEARS HAS FOUND THAT A LACK OF INTEREST BY SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS LED TO REPEATED FAILURES TO INVESTIGATE BEFORE SAYS IT'S MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN TACKLING THE ISSUE
THE TIME IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE LET'S GET MORE ON THE ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS YESTERDAY I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY OUR SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FRANK GARDNER AND FRANK SOME INFORMATION COMING OUT THIS MORNING ABOUT THOSE WHO WERE INVOLVED WE KNOW THE TWO WHO WERE KILLED WHO BLEW THEMSELVES UP AT THE AIRPORT WE'RE BROTHERS THAT'S RIGHT HOLLERED AND BRAHIM AND BUCK THEY WERE EFFECTIVELY SUICIDE BOMBERS THEY ARE LINKED
TO INDIRECTLY TO THE PARIS ATTACK THROUGH FINGERPRINTS THE MAN THAT EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR NOW ACROSS EUROPE WHAT EVERYBODY IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS MEASUREMENT ELLA SHHH ROWIE MEASUREMENT ALLOW ROWIE HE IS THE SUSPECTED BOMB MAKER
NOW SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT PICTURE TAKEN IN THE DEPARTURES THE DEPARTURE HALL IN BRUSSELS OF SOLVENT AMARE PORT OF THREE MEN WHEELING THE TRUCK WHEELING LUGGAGE TROLLEYS
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS NUR JAMILLA SHOWY AND HE'S WEARING A HAT AND THE KIND OF JACKET OVER A WHITE WHITE JERSEY
HE IS BELIEVED TO BE THE BOMB MAKER HIS FINGERPRINTS WERE FOUND IN PARIS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PARIS ATTACKS AND HE'S BELIEVED TO HAVE MADE AND DESIGNED TO THE BOMBS THAT DETONATED IN BRUSSELS YESTERDAY AND
THERE WERE OF COURSE OTHERS WE KNOW BECAUSE OF THE THE TUBE HOW DO WE KNOW HOW MANY COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS SERIES OF ATTACKED IT I MEAN IT'S OBVIOUSLY AN ONGOING LIVE INVESTIGATION AND BOTH THE PARIS AND BRUSSELS PROSECUTORS AND INVESTIGATORS ARE VERY MUCH HOPING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET SOME INFORMATION OUT OF
I'LL JUST TO SALERNO REMEMBER THEY CAUGHT HIM VERY DRAMATICALLY ON FRIDAY NIGHT HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY AND HE WAS SHOT AND WOUNDED IN THE LEG BUT BUT ONLY BUT ONLY MILDLY AND HE IS CO OPERATING WITH THE BRUSSELS PROSECUTORS COS HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE EXTRADITED TO PARIS HE KNOWS IF HE GOES TO PARIS
YOU KNOW AND HE'S FOUND GUILTY HE'S GOING TO HAVE A VERY VERY TOUGH SENTENCE
PRESUMABLY YOU'VE GOT A TOUGH ONE OF BELGIUM AS WELL BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE BELGIUM SO HE IS A FRENCH NATIONAL WHO GREW UP IN BELGIUM IT'S SUNNY QUITE COMPLICATED ALL THIS BUT THE POINT IS THAT THESE ON NETWORKS THEY'RE ALL INTERCONNECTED AND THE FRENCH INVESTIGATORS AND THE BELT INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TRYING TO CATCH UP THERE
THEY'VE GOT AN AWFUL LOT OF GROUND TO CATCH UP BECAUSE OF THE CRITICISM OF BELGIAN INTELLIGENCE IS THAT IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE NEAR GOOD ENOUGH
WELL IT ISN'T IT'S GOT BETTER IT WAS SIPS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING IT'S NOW GOT BETTER IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE IN PART OF THE PROBLEM AS I THINK I MENTIONED YESTERDAY IS THAT
AND INTELLIGENCE DOESN'T SHARE TIME INFORMATION WITH THE PEOPLE IN BELGIUM POLICE WHO NEED TO KNOW IT BOLTON POLICE IS VERY FRAGMENTED THEY SPEAK TO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THERE ARE SIX DIFFERENT FORCES ACROSS SPREAD ACROSS NINETEEN BOROUGHS IN BRUSSELS IT'S NOT VERY CONNECTED AS NOT VERY JOINED UP
AND THIS MEANS THAT VITAL CLUES OR MISTER I MEAN IT IS EXTRAORDINARY THAT THE MOST WANTED MAN IN EUROPE SILLA UP TO SADDAM WAS ABLE TO HIDE
PRACTICALLY IN PLAIN SIGHT IN THAT BOROUGH OF AND BEG FOR FOUR MONTHS RIGHT UNDER THE NOSES OF THE POLICE
THAT TELLS US SOMETHING ELSE BUT THE POLICE AND BELGIUM HAD VERY POOR COMMUNITY RELATIONS THERE WHERE WE WERE IN BRITAIN TEN YEARS AGO REMEMBER FOREST GATE VERY ANGRY LOCAL RESIDENTS AT HUGE POLICE PRESENCE
DOES THE SAME FRICTION GOING ON ABOUT BRUSSELS WHICH MEANS PEOPLE AREN'T TELLING THE POLICE THEY'RE NOT GIVING THEM TIP OFFS FRANK ON HER THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL ALSO WITH US IN THE STUDIO IS AGHAIDH TROUVER ROY WHO'S BELGIANS ARE BATTERED HER TO THE U.K. GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IS THAT RIGHT THAT REALLY BELT IT WAS JUST NOT UP TO THE CHALLENGE
WELL I THINK THAT AS YOU CORRESPOND JUST SAID THAT WE ARE IMPROVING I MEAN WE ARE DISCOVERING A NEW ISSUE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DISCOVERED A FEW YEARS AGO THE SYRIAN FIGHTERS YOUNG PEOPLE BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS GOING TO SEE SOME OF THEM COMING BACK
AND WE I THINK OR THE FIRST COUNTRY TO START DOCUMENTING THAT PHENOMENON THAT WAS NOT HAS NOW SPREAD ALL OVER THE WORLD WE ARE BEATING UP A TASK FOR US BOTH AND FINANCIAL MEANS BUT ALSO IN IN PERSONNEL WE'RE OBVIOUSLY DOING BETTER THE ARRESTS OF LAST WEEK YOU SHOWED IT
WE HAVE STILL AN ISSUE THE PRIME MINISTER AND OUR MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG THAT IF LAST WEEK WAS A VICTORY IN A CERTAIN SENSE WE ARE STILL IN FOR THE LONG HAUL AND WHAT THE WAR IS NOT OVER BUT WHAT SEEMED EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT THAT ARREST LAST WEEK IS THAT HE WAS THERE HE WAS IN HIS HOME PATCH ALL ALONG
WELL AT THE END OF THE SEDATION WILL SHOW WHETHER HE WAS THERE ALL ALONG HE WAS FOUND AGAIN IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD OBVIOUSLY HE HAD HE WAS PROTECTED HE HAD A GROUP OF PEOPLE
FRIENDS OF HIS ARE FAMILY FAMILIES OF HIS FRIENDS WHO WERE PROTECTING HIM IN HIDING IN THAT IS TRUE BUT I WOULD SAY THE EXTENT OF THAT OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING WHERE HE HAS BEEN WILL PROBABLY KNOWN IN THERE IN A FEW DAYS TO COME WELL WHERE INVESTIGATORS
INTERROGATING HIM DO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD BUT DOCTOR PETER NORMAN HE'S DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE STUDY OF RADICALISATION EARLIER SAID ON THE PROGRAMME THAT PARTS OF BRUSSELS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BY THE SECURITY SERVICES FOR DECADES ALTHOUGH YOU POINT TO THE RECENT FONDANT PHENOMENON OF PEOPLE COMING BACK FROM SYRIA THE FACT THAT THEY WERE GOING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE IS POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THAT ABANDONMENT AND ALSO PERHAPS BECAUSE OF HER
A SENSE OF NOT HAVING SUCH A STRONG SENSE OF BELGIAN IDENTITY DO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THAT'S IT IS NOT ENTIRELY RIGHT I THINK THAT
YOU'LL HAVE INDEED NEIGHBOURHOODS THAT HAVE NOT DEVELOPED AS WELL AS OTHERS YOU HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY STRONG STRONGLY COMMITTED TO THESE NEIGHBOURHOODS I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS A HESITATION BETWEEN
IT'S AFTERWARDS THAT YOU SAID WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE MORE OFTEN AND MORE MORE MORE AND MORE STRONGLY BUT DO YOU WANT TO SYSTEMATICALLY ANTAGONISED COMMUNITIES DO YOU WANT TO SYSTEMATICALLY ANTAGONISED NEIGHBOURHOODS IS ALWAYS EASY TO SAY AFTERWARDS WE SHOULD WE SHOULD OF AT THE TIME THE THREADS WERE NOT THERE AND I SAID THIS SERIA ISSUE IS RELATIVELY NEW
AND IT'S TRUE HINDSIGHT IS A WONDERFUL THING BUT THERE IS ONE OF THE KNOWLEDGE MINCE THAT SEEMS TO BE MADE A NEW TALK ABOUT IT HE'S IN AN INCREASING MANPOWER THAT ACTUALLY GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE THREAT YOU JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POLICE OR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ON THE GROUND
WELL IT'S THEIRS THERE'S OBVIOUSLY THIS OBVIOUSLY AS THE THREAT HAS BEEN INCREASING IN ALL YOU HAVE TO PLACE YOURSELVES BACK FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN WE STARTED NOTICING THESE DEPARTURES YOU CANNOT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM LEAVING YOU'RE NOR CAN I PREVENT THEM FROM GOING THROUGH TURKEY INTO INTO SERIA PEOPLE WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH SO THE PHENOMENON IS RELATIVELY NEW SO YOU WE HAD TO MOVE UP TO THE CHALLENGE AND WE WENT AND MAYBE
PIECE BY PIECE HAPHAZARDLY IN THE BEGINNING IT IS NOT EASY THESE ARE PROFESSIONALS
AND THEY KNOW HOW TO THEY KNOW HOW TO PUT UP A COMMANDO OPERATIONS AND THOSE WHO ARE NOW IT'S POINTING TO THE EARS OPEN BORDERS AS BEING AS ALLOWING THIS SORT OF THING TO HAPPEN OR ALLOWING
TERRORIST TO MOVE TO FREELY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM WELL LOOK OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN ISSUE I MEAN THERE'S NO THERE'S NO THERE'S NO
THERE'S NO HIDING BEHIND BEHIND BEHIND ONE'S FINGER IT'S AN ISSUE ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK FOR THIS BUT ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO A PUB I WOULD SAY BUT THE POLICY OF OF POLICE
REPRESSION AND SO ON
DO WE WANT TO CHANGE TO SUCH AN EXTENT OUR LIFESTYLES TO INCREASE SECURITY EVERYWHERE TO HAVE MUCH MORE VIGILANTISM ON THE STREETS OF OUR COUNTRIES IF WE WIND THAT WILL BE HANDING OVER ALREADY A VICTORY TO THE TERRACED GATOR IF I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE AND M. PIECE WILL QUIZ THE HEAD OF THE E.D.F. ENERGY TODAY ABOUT WHEN IF AT ALL HE PLANS TO BUILD HINKLEY C. POWER STATION THE NEW REACTORS ARE MASSIVELY DELAYED AS E.D.F. STRUGGLES TO FIND FUNDING
APPEARS TO REFLECT A WIDER PROBLEM WITH PRIVATE INVESTORS RELUCTANT TO FUND A BIG NUCLEAR REACTORS SO PERHAPS THE ANSWER IS SMALL NUCLEAR REACTORS THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS LAUNCHED A COMPETITION FOR THE FIRST MINI REACTOR IN THE U.K. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE SMALL ENOUGH TO BE MOVED ON THE BACK OF A LORRY IT'S PART OF A GLOBAL RUSH TOWARDS SMALL REACTORS AS OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER KARABIN REPORTS
THERE'S NOTHING NEW ABOUT SMALL NUCLEAR REACTORS THEY'VE BEEN POWERING VESSELS LIKE THE AMERICAN SKIPJACK SUBMARINE SINCE THE FIFTIES
AND BIKE UNDERWATER THE LEMON WITH CRUISIN
NOW THE SMALL REACTOR IS COMING ON TO LAND AFTER SIX DECADES OF GIANT REACTORS CONSTRUCTED ON SITE MANY DELAYED AND OVER BUDGET THE INDUSTRY IS PLANNING TO BUILD SMALL REACTORS IN FACTORIES I'VE COME TO AN OFFICE JUST SOUTH OF LONDON'S BLACKFRIARS BRIDGE
TO MEET A MAN IS ONE OF THE NEW CONTESTANTS IN THE BATTLE FOR NUCLEAR
TOM MONDAY'S VICE PRESIDENT OF NEW SCALE AN AMERICAN FIRM THAT HOPES TO HAVE SMALLER REACTOR'S READY TO SAIL TO THE U.K. BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX
THE SIMPLICITY OF THE DESIGN AND THE FACT THAT IT'S BASED UPON TRIED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY GIVES US THE CONFIDENCE AND ASSURANCE THAT WE CAN MAKE THESE UNITS
AT THE PRICE AND AT THE SCHEDULE
ACCORDING TO MIKE TYNE AND HEAD OF THE NUCLEAR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING RESEARCH CENTRE BUILDING SMALL HAS MANY ADVANTAGES OF COUNTRY
FACTORY ENVIRONMENT
MAJOR ADVANTAGES IN INCREASING CERTAINTY ON COST QUALITY CHEFS
AND I WOULD EXPECT
MANUFACTURING COST SAVINGS IN EXCESS OF THIRTY PER CENT OR NOT
MY TIME IN CHEF
PART OF THE NEW MINI NUKE FUTURE MAY BE TAKING SHAPE
RESEARCHER HERE HOODY BOY IS EXPERIMENTING WITH MAKING COMPONENTS FOR SMALL NUCLEAR PLANTS
WITH A THREE.D. PRINTER DISMAY THEM RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BEING USED BUT WILL IT BE THAT'S WHERE THE POLICY MAKERS AND BUDDIES
THE TECHNOLOGY MAY BE EXCITING BUT JOHN SO VERN FROM GREENPEACE SIMPLY DOESN'T TRUST HIS LATEST GUST OF NUCLEAR HI
WITH ALL THE PROMISES ABOUT NUCLEAR
IS THAT IT'S ALWAYS JAM TOMORROW AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REALITY OF THE COSTS HAVE ALWAYS GONE UP WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SOLUTIONS WHICH IS STARING US IN THE FACE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY STORAGE ALL THOSE COSTS OR FALL
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS WHERE THE ART
THERE ARE UNSOLVED PROBLEMS WITH SMALL NUCLEAR FIRST IT WON'T HELP ANY NATION ACHIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE TARGETS UP TO TWENTY THIRTY OR MAYBE EVEN TWENTY FORTY BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY WON'T HAVE SPREAD THAT FAST SECOND THERE'S STILL A QUESTION OF WHERE TO PUT THE NUCLEAR WASTE
DAME SUEY ON A LONG TERM NUCLEAR CHAMPION SAYS SMALL NUKES DO SOLVE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM DOGGING CURRENT NUCLEAR AMBITIONS
THEY WILL BE MUCH EASIER TO FINANCE THAN GIANTS LIKE HINKLEY POINT A BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU YOU HAVE TO BORROW IS ACTUALLY AFFORDABLE FOR A SINGLE UNIT AND THE PAYBACK TIME IS MUCH SHORTER IT'S ONLY TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS NOT SEVEN TO EIGHT YEARS SO THESE THINGS ARE READILY FINANCE SYBIL IN TODAY'S PRIVATE SECTOR WORLD
THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HE'S ALREADY CLEAN ON MILLY NUKES HE'S LAUNCHED A COMPETITION FOR ONE IN THE U.K. HYPE OR HOPE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
ROGER HARRER BEN REPORTING IT'S NOW QUARTER TO NINE EUROPE HAS SUFFERED TWO MAJOR TERRORIST INCIDENTS WITHIN DAYS ONE HERE IN BRUSSELS AND ONE IN ISTANBUL WHAT WILL THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM IMPACT BE DOCTOR KAREN FUND HIM PAUL IS HERE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE AND SO TO VICTORIA BACON HEAD OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AT APT AT THE TRAVEL ASSOCIATION GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH
DOCTOR FUND HE PULL IF WE CAN START WITH YOU
WHERE DOES THIS WELL END I WAS ABOUT TO SAY NOT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS AN END IN SIGHT AT THE MOMENT
RIGHT I THINK FOR MANY PEOPLE FIND THIS COUNTER I SAW CAMPAIGN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS
THEY WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED THAT AS A JOINT GOVERNMENTS ARE SQUEEZING I SAW AT THE CORER AND ROCKER IN SYRIA AND IN MOSEL IN IRAQ THAT EYESORE WE'LL BE LASHING OUT AT THE PERIPHERY THERE MANY PEOPLE HAD ANTICIPATED THAT ATTACKS WOULD HAPPEN IN EUROPE
SO WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW IS THE CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO REALLY ACCELERATE PART OF THE REASON SO MANY YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ARE ATTRACTED TO
TO JOIN I SOLD TO TRAVEL TO SYRIA AND IRAQ IS BECAUSE OF THIS PERCEPTION OF INVINCIBILITY THAT I SAW HOUSE AND AS THAT PERCEPTION HAS REMOVED FEWER PEOPLE WILL WANT TO JOIN I SAW AND WE WILL HAVE FEWER ATTACKS BUT I AM AFRAID IN THE NEXT YEAR OR SO WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING MORE OF THIS
IT'S A PERCEPTION OF INSIPID INVINCIBILITY IS IT THAT DRIVES THEM RATHER THAN WHAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE WEST'S ATTACKS ON
YES TARGETS YEAH IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I DON'T THINK WE FULLY UNDERSTAND BUT I DO THINK THAT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE THIS SO CALLED KALLAR FATE THAT THESE MEN ARE GOING AROUND YOU KNOW IN THEIR BLACK SUITS DOING REALLY
PRETTY SCARY THINGS AS ATTRACTIVE AND APPEALING TO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE SO THEY HAD TO SQUEEZE TWO URNS I THINK WERE PROBABLY BETTER ON THE SECURITY SIDE OF USING INTELLIGENCE POLICE MILITARY TYPE TOOLS THEN WE ARE ON THE SOFTER TOURS A COUNTER RADICALISATION TOURS
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS TALKING TO A COUPLE OF PEOPLE HERE IN BRUSSELS EARLY EUROPE ARE HELD AND VERY MUCH THE IDEA FROM INSIDE THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY HERE THAT
OF THIS WASN'T EXPRESSED AS AN EXCUSE BUT THAT THERE ARE REASONS UNEMPLOYMENT A PERCEPTION OF RACISM WITHIN IN THIS CASE BELGIAN SOCIETY AND THE LIKE WHICH ENCOURAGES JUST A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE TO SAY I'VE HAD ENOUGH I'M GOING TO GO TO THE
RADICAL EXTREME YEAH I'M NOT SURE IF ONLY BY THAT ARGUMENT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TO HER IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS AND THEY DON'T LASH OUT IN THIS WAY SO I DO THINK THAT THERE IS SOME OTHER TYPE OF APPEAL THAT EYESORE HAS EVEN DIFFERENT FROM WHAT OUR KINDER OR OTHER GROUPS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE HAD IN THE PAST HIM IN THE NUMBERS JOINING I SAW
A MUCH MUCH LARGER OR THEIR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE TO TRAVELLING TO SYRIA AND IRAQ NOW LIBYA THE NUMBERS JOINING IN THE PAST DECADE OF ALBA IN THE TRICKLES THEY WERE IN A HANDFUL SO THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON THAT ISN'T JUST ABOUT ALIENATION MARGINALISATION THOSE OTHER ARGUMENTS OR PEOPLE HAVE YOU DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE AND I DON'T THINK WE FULLY UNDERSTAND AS WELL WE NEED TO
AND BEYOND THE RADICALISATION WITHIN EUROPE I MEAN WHAT IS GOING ON IN TURKEY SEEMS TO BE VERY WORRYING INDEED YES I WAS ACTUALLY IN TURKEY LAST WEEK AND THERE ARE BARNS IN ANKARA IN ISTANBUL AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THE ISTANBUL BOMBING WAS ATTRIBUTED TO I SAW I DON'T THINK THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN ISTANBUL
AND WON'T HAPPEN IMPAIR A SLASH BRUSSELS RECENTLY BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO CAN TRAVEL TO MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES TO CARS
AND TRAVEL BACK I MEAN SERIOUS CLOSE ENOUGH BUT TURKEY ITSELF BORDERS THE EUROPEAN UNION RATE MY BIG CONCERN IS OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO AS I THOUGHT IS SQUEEZED OUT OF SYRIA AND IRAQ THERE WILL BE SOME VERY WELL TRAINED
FOREIGN FIGHTERS WHO DON'T FORGET THAT THE THEATRE IF YOU SURVIVE IRAQ AND SYRIA YOU'RE FACING AN ARRAY OF HEZBOLLAH AROUND
SEARING REGIME TRIPS ON THE ONE SIDE I SAW ON THE OTHER SIDE AND ANOTHER AND A NUMBER OF OTHER GROUPS LIKE AL CARRIED JOB AND IF YOU SURVIVE THAT YOU'RE A VERY HIGHLY TRAINED VERY SCARY PERSON OR MANY THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE GOING TO EUROPE THEY MAY NOT GO BACK TO WHERE THEY'RE FROM IF YOU HAVE A BRITISH PASSPORT YOU MAY NOT GO BACK TO THE U.K. YOU MAY WANT TO GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND I'M NOT SURE OUR SECURITY SERVICES ARE PLANNING AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD DO TO REALLY DEAL WITH THIS
VERY WORRYING VICTORIA BACON FROM ABTA PRESUMABLY THIS IS ALL HAVING AN IMPACT ON ON MOVEMENT THE OTHER WAY TOURISTS FROM EUROPE GOING TO NORTH AFRICA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
YES WE'VE SEEN QUITE DRAMATIC IMPACTS IN TERMS OF NORTH AFRICA AND ALSO MORE RECENTLY TURKEY ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF TOURIST NUMBERS SO LATEST FIGURES SHOW THAT PEOPLE ARE SORT OF VOTING WITH THEIR FEET AND A IN A SENSE AND CHOOSING TO GO TO DESTINATIONS LIKE SPAIN ITALY PORTUGAL FOR EXAMPLE A HOLIDAY BOOKINGS ARE SELLING VERY VERY WELL SO'S DESTINATIONS BUT BUT PROBABLY AT THE COST OF DESTINATIONS LIKE TUNISIA AND EGYPT IN PARTICULAR WHO'S WHO'VE BEEN HIT VERY VERY BADLY BY WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
AND ARE YOU ABLE TO COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT I MEAN PRESUMABLY THAT'S HAVING A BIG ECONOMIC IMPACT ON SOME OF THOSE NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRIES WHICH THEN FEEDS BACK INTO THE WHOLE UNEMPLOYMENT AND RADICALISM CYCLE
YEAH I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF THE LINK BETWEEN THAT AND RADICALISM BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT IN A WEEK WE SAW IN TUNISIA LAST YEAR AND THAT RESORT WAS IS DEPENDENT ON TOURISM AND MANY PEOPLE'S JOBS ARE DEPENDENT ON TOURISM SO THE TROUBLE OF ICE CHANGES AND PEOPLE AREN'T ADVICE TO TRAVEL THERE ANY MORE THAN THAT DOES HAVE HAVEN'T HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT CARRYING VON HIPPO AND VICTORIA BACON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME IS NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE
ONE FINE DAY FROM ENGLISH NATIONAL OPERA'S CURRENT PRODUCTION OF PUCCINI'S MADAME BUTTERFLY
THE SHOW GOES ON BUT BACKSTAGE THE TROUBLES CONTINUE THEIR LATEST SETBACK FOR THE COMPANY IS THAT ITS MUSIC DIRECTOR MARK WRIGGLES WORTH HAS RESIGNED WILL GONE PUTS IS OUR ARTS EDITOR WILL DO WE KNOW WHY
WE'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA HE COMPLETELY DISAGREES WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THE BOARD IS TAKING THE OH I SEE YOUR COPY OF THE LETTER THAT HE SENT TO THE MUSICIANS OF THE ENGLISH NATIONAL OPERA BUT SAYING THAT HE'S RESIGNING SAYING THAT THE COMPANY IS EVOLVING INTO SOMETHING I DO NOT RECOGNISE THEM AS HARD AS I HAVE TRIED TO ARGUE TO MAINTAIN WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE FUNDAMENTAL PILLARS OF OUR IDENTITY I FAILED TO PERSUADE OTHERS OF THIS NECESSITY THE OTHERS TO WHOM HE REFERS IS THE BOARD AND
I SUPPOSE MOST PARTICULARLY THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE CRESTS POLLOCK AND THE PILLARS HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS I DO NOT AGREE HE SAYS LATER IN THE LETTER WITH THE DECISION TO CREATE A PART TIME SEASON THIS DECISION IS TO REDUCE THE PROGRAMME OF THE YEAR FROM TWELVE OPERAS A YEAR ROUGHLY DOWN TO EIGHT AND GOING DARK FOR A FEW MONTHS AND LETTING OUT THE COLOSSEUM TO
ANYBODY I SUPPOSE OUR HIGHEST BIDDER HE THINKS THAT FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERMINES IT NOT ONLY AS AN OPERA COMPANY BUT THE MUSICIANS TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM AT THE STAND THAT HE'D LIKE THEM TO PERFORM THEY WON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT PRACTICE TO TO TO TO TO SING THAT TO SING THE OPERAS BUT UNDERLYING THAT ALL THIS OF COURSE IS OF THIS HUGE CUTS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY THE ISSUE HERE SO THE BOARD AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS THAT THIS IS A FIVE MILLION POUND CUT
FROM SEVENTY MILLION POUND SUBSIDY FROM ARTS COUNCIL ENGLAND DOWN TO TWELVE WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT THAT'S CUTTING INTO MUSCLE NOT FAT AT THE BOARD THING A REDUCTION IN THE PROGRAMME AS A WAY TO GO WIGGLESWORTH FELT THAT MAKING THIS SHOW'S DOING MORSE JUST AS MANY SHOWS TWELVE SHOWS BUT MAKING THEM LESS EXPENSIVE MAYBE WITH LESS EXTRAVAGANT SETS NOT SO MANY COSTUME CHANGES HE FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT IT WAS A WAY TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE REALLY HIGH GRADE TOP NOTCH MUSICALS AND OPERA
AT THE Y. YOU KNOW IT WAS POSSIBLE IF THEY WOULD REDUCE A LITTLE BIT ON THE PRODUCTION COSTS AT THE BOARD DIDN'T AGREE AND HE LEFT THERE HE WILL BE REPLACED WHAT AT THE END OF THE SEASON IT'S A MESS TO BE HONEST HE'S GONNA CARRY ON CONDUCTING HE SAYS UNTIL THERE'S A NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR BUT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR ARTISTIC DIRECTOR THEY RECENTLY LOST THE CHAIRMAN OR CHIEF EXECUTIVE TO NOW HE'S GONE IT LEAVES THE COMPANY WITHOUT AN ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AND THE MUSIC DIRECTOR THIS IS A MAJOR
OPERA COMPANY NOT JUST BRITISH OPERA COMEDY BUT A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL OPERA COMPANY WHICH HE'S WON SEVERAL IT WAS YEARS AGO ONCE OLIVIER AWARDS IN THE PARTY IS IS DOWN TO SORT THIS IF SEVERAL OLIVIER AWARDS THIS YEAR IT'S START OUT AS A REALLY GOOD RUN OF SHOWS THIS SPRING ARTISTICALLY IT IS HAVING A ROBBIE RIPE IT'S NOT RUBBISH AND DISS TO THINK YOU'VE GOT A MAJOR OPERA COMPANY IN THESE MUSICIANS WITH NOBODY LEADING THEM IT'S KIND OF A DISASTROUS FRANKLY WELL GUMPERT THANK YOU
IT'S FIVE MINUTES TO NINE WE ARE IN BRUSSELS AND HAVE BEEN ALL MORNING OF COURSE AND THERE HAS BEEN NEWS DEVELOPING THROUGH THE MORNING THERE IS IDENTIFICATION OF SOME OF THE ATTACKERS AT LEAST FROM YESTERDAY CHRIS MORRIS IS THE B.B.C.'S CORRESPONDENT IN BRUSSELS AND CHRIS THE WORRYING THING IS THAT THE NETWORK THAT THE POLICE HERE HAVE BEEN HUNTING FOR FOR SO LONG HAS STRUCK AGAIN
YES I THINK THAT'S RIGHT MATTHEW YOU LOOK AT THE NAMES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BY CRYO WE BROTHERS ONE OF THEM APPEARS TO HAVE
RENTED UNDER A FALSE NAME A FLAT IN WHICH LAST WEEK A FINGERPRINT OF SULLA ABTA SLAM THE SURVIVING SUSPECTS IN THE PARIS TERROR ATTACKS WAS FOUND THE OTHER MAN HIS NAME'S BEEN MENTIONED IS POSSIBLY THE MAN WHO STILL ON THE RUN IS LUSH FOR A WEEK HE HAS CLEARLY BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A WANTED ACCOMPLICE OF ABTA SLAM AND SO THERE IS THAT WORRYING
FACT IT SEEMS THAT AFTER FOUR MONTHS OF INTENSIVE SECURITY OPERATIONS INVOLVING THE BELGIANS CLOSE CO OPERATION WITH FRANCE HELP FROM THEIR ALLIES IN THE U.K. AND THE U.S. MEMBERS OF THIS SAME EXTENDED NETWORK HAVE STRUCK AGAIN WITH DEVASTATING EFFECT AND THAT COMING JUST FOUR DAYS AFTER SALA
WAS EVENTUALLY CAPTURED JUST A FEW HUNDRED METRES FROM HIS OWN FAMILY HOME IN THE BRUSSELS DISTRICT OF MOLYN BECK THAT ALL SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A LONG LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THE BELGIAN AND BY EXTENSION THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN AUTHORITIES GET ON TOP OF THIS
ANY WORD ON WHO ATTACKED THE METRO YET WHETHER THAT WAS A PERSON IN A SUICIDE BOMBING OR WHETHER IT SIMPLY AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE LEFT ON THE TRAIN
THERE'S BEEN MUCH LESS SAID ABOUT THE DETAIL OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THE METRO
THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE GROUP APPEAR TO HAVE SAID IN ONE OF THEIR CLAIMS OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S SUICIDE BOMBERS STRUCK AND THERE WAS THAT IT SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE BOMBER
ON THE METRO AS WELL THAT HASN'T BECOME CLEAR YET NO NAMES EMERGED FOR A POTENTIAL SUSPECT IN THAT ATTACK EITHER OBVIOUSLY HAPPENING UNDERGROUND IN A TUNNEL IT WAS MORE CONFUSING PROBABLY FORENSICS ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AS WELL
THEY MIGHT BE IN A MUCH LARGER AND LESS ENCLOSED SPACE OF AN AIRPORT THAT'S ONE THING I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR THROUGHOUT THE DAY MORE DETAILS EMERGE ON THAT AND ALSO OF COURSE MORE POLITICAL COMMENT THE THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER MANUEL VALVES WILL BE IN BRUSSELS ON A PRE ARRANGED VISIT
HE'S BEEN VERY STRONG IN HIS LANGUAGE YESTERDAY HE SAID EUROPE IS AT WAR ACTS OF WAR HAVE BEEN WAGED AGAINST EUROPE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WE HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THAT SO WELL BILL ALL THAT GOING ON IN PUBLIC BUT OF COURSE BEHIND THE SCENES THE ABSOLUTE PRIORITY IS TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS IN THE INVESTIGATION
INDEED AND JUST JUST TELL US WE WOULD SPEND A LOT OF THE PROGRAMME THIS MORNING ABOUT THE BELGIAN OF SEEMING FAILURES IN BELGIAN INTELLIGENCE IS THAT DO YOU THINK HOW THE BELGIANS PERCEIVE IT
SOME DO SOME DON'T I'VE SPOKEN TO DOCTOR BELGIANS WHO BELIEVED THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE BEING UNFAIRLY MALIGNED OTHERS WHO SAY YES WE DO HAVE A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY TOO MANY LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY TOO MANY NATIONAL PARLIAMENT WAY TOO MANY POLICE FORCES AND THEIR INFORMATION WHICH NEEDS TO BE IN ONE PLACE IS OFTEN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG
CHRIS MORRIS IN BRUSSELS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE GATHERING HERE IN CENTRAL BRUSSELS WERE JUST OFF THE GRAND PLACE THE MAGNIFICENT
MEDIEVAL SQUARE IN BRUSSELS OUTSIDE THE BOERS AND SOMEONE HAS HUNG A BANNER UP ON IT THIS MORNING SAYING YOU NEED CONTRE LA HAINE UNITED AGAINST HATE MORE PEOPLE ARE STOPPING ON THEIR WAY TO WORK CONTEMPLATING THE CANDLES AND FLOWERS LEFT ON THE PAVING STONES IN THAT IN THE DRIZZLE HERE
THE IMAGE THAT'S BEEN CULTIVATED OF THIS CITY OVER THE YEARS IS NOT A PARTICULARLY COLOURFUL ONE IT'S A PICTURE OF SUMMITS AND CIVIL SERVANTS IN SUITS A PICTURE OF INSTITUTIONS AND BUREAUCRACY BUT NOT OF PEOPLE AND YET OF COURSE BRUSSELS IS FAR MORE THAN A SHORTHAND FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION IT'S A CITY IN WHICH I LIVED FOR FOUR YEARS AS EUROPE CORRESPONDENT WITH MY FAMILY
I LIVED IN A CITY OF PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS OR CITY OF CAFES AND WORLD CLASS RESTAURANTS THIS IS A PEACEFUL CITY ONE WHERE ON A SUNDAY WHEN MOST OF THE SHOPS REMAIN CLOSED YOU CAN STROLL DOWN CALM BOULEVARDS AND THROUGH LUSH WOODLAND AND TODAY IT'S A CITY COMING TO TERMS VERY QUICKLY AGAIN IT SEEMS FROM WHERE I AM WITH A MURDEROUS ACT AT ITS VERY HEART AND ACT THE VAST MAJORITY HERE SAY THEY WILL NOT ALLOWED TO DESTROY
