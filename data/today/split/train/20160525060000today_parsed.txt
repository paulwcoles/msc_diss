THAT LEAVES IN HIS RED THIS MORNING BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THE RESPECTED ECONOMIC RESEARCH GROUP THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES HAS WARNED THAT BRITAIN COULD FACE AN EXTRA TWO YEARS OF AUSTERITY IF IT LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION IT SAYS BRICKS IT WOULD INCREASE UNCERTAINTY IN THE SHORT TERM OR MAKE TRADE MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE LONGER RUN THE INSTITUTE HAS RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE E.U. IN THE PAST AND VOTE LEVERS DESCRIBED IT AS A PAID UP PROPAGANDA ARM OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HERE'S OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME ON AHMED
THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES SAYS THAT BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE GOVERNMENT COULD BE BETWEEN TWENTY AND FORTY BILLION POUNDS WORSE OFF BECAUSE OF A SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY AND LOWER TAX RECEIPTS
THEIR STUDY ARGUES THE GOVERNMENT COULD BE OBLIGED TO MAKE UP THE SHORTFALL BY INCREASING TAXES CUTTING PUBLIC SERVICES AND REDUCING BENEFITS IF IT STILL WANTED TO HIT A BUDGET SURPLUS BY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY
SUPPORTERS OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. SAY THE ECONOMY WOULD PROSPER FREED AS THEY SEE IT FROM THE SHACKLES OF THE SINGLE MARKET THAT WOULD LEAVE THE PUBLIC FINANCES IN BETTER SHAPE THAN PRESENTLY
A DOZEN FORMER SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE SPOKEN OUT AGAINST BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY INCLUDE MAJOR GENERAL JULIAN THOMPSON THE COMMANDER DURING THE FALKLANDS WAR AND A FORMER DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL FORCES GENERAL SIR MICHAEL ROSE THEIR WARNINGS INCLUDE A CLAIM THAT THE E.U. WAS TRYING TO SET UP ITS OWN ARMY WHICH COULD UNDERMINE NATO
EUROZONE FINANCE MINISTERS HAVE AGREED TO UNLOCK ANOTHER EIGHT BILLION POUNDS IN BAILOUT FUNDS FOR GREECE THEY ALSO AGREE DURING LATE NIGHT TALKS IN BRUSSELS TO PHASE IN DEBT RELIEF IN TWO YEARS' TIME THE KEY DEMAND OF ATHENS AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE NINETEEN MINISTERS SAID THE DEAL HAD BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY GRACE'S ECONOMIC REFORMS THE GREEK FINANCE MINISTER YOU COULD SACK A LOT US SAID IT WAS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR HIS COUNTRY
I THINK THERE IS SOME GROUND FOR OPTIMISM THAT THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF TURNING GREECE'S VICIOUS CIRCLE OF RECESSION MEASURES RECESSION INTO ONE WHERE INVESTORS HAVE A CLEAR RUNWAY TWO INVESTS IN GREECE AND TURN THE CORNER
KURDISH FIGHTERS SO THEY'RE BEGINNING A CAMPAIGN TO DRIVE ISLAMIC STATE MILLICENT'S FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE NORTH OF THE SYRIAN CITY OF RAKKA THE U.S. MILITARY HAS SAID IT WILL CARRY OUT AIR STRIKES TO SUPPORT THE OFFENSIVE AND THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID MOSCOW WAS READY TO COORDINATE WITH THE KURDS AND THE U.S.
THE BOARD OF THE INDIAN FIRM TATA WILL MEET IN MUMBAI TODAY TO DRAW UP A SHORTLIST OF PREFERRED BIDDERS FRITZ YOU CASE STEEL OPERATIONS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS IN SUPPORT TO POTENTIAL BUYERS TO TRY TO AVOID THOUSANDS OF JOB LOSSES OUR BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK REPORTS
THE BOARD OF TATA STEEL ARE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE PREFERRED BIDDERS FROM THE EIGHT WHO ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE SUBMITTED PROPOSALS THAT JOB WAS MADE EASIER WHEN TWO OF THEM JOIN FORCES EXCALIBUR STEEL AS A MANAGEMENT LED BID WHICH WELL BEGONE EXPERIENCE IS LIGHT ON CASH ACCORDING TO WELSH FIRST MINISTER CARWYN JONES
LIBERTY HOUSE WHICH IS ALREADY BOUGHT ASSETS FROM TATA HAD PLANS TO REPLACE THE EXISTING STEEL PRODUCTION FURNACES WITH LESS COSTLY STEEL RECYCLING FURNACES THE TWO GROUPS NOW THINK THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER BY HAVING PRODUCTION AND RECYCLING CO EXISTING AT LEAST FOR A WHILE THE B. B. C. UNDERSTANDS THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT'S FAVOURITE OPTION AS IT WOULD SEEM MORE JOB SAVED THAN SOME OF THE OTHER BIDDERS FROM THE U.S. CHINA AND INDIA
A REPORT BY THE CARE QUALITY COMMISSION SAYS NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO CARE HOMES IN ENGLAND THAT IT RATED AS INADEQUATE HAVE NOW IMPROVED IT SAYS THE FIGURES SHOW THAT A TOUGHER INSPECTION REGIME INTRODUCED IN OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTEEN IS PUSHING UP STANDARDS THE FINDINGS HAVE BEEN WELCOMED BY A CARE HOMES BUT THEY WARNED THAT A SQUEEZE ON FEES FROM COUNCILS MEANS MANY AND STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE
THERE'S BEEN A SHARP DROP IN THE AMOUNT OF ANTIBIOTICS PRESCRIBED BY G.P.S IN ENGLAND N.H.S. FIGURES FOR THE PAST YEAR SHOW THERE WERE TWO POINT SIX MILLION FEWER PRESCRIPTIONS THAN IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS IT'S A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM
THERE'S BEEN A BIG PUSH WITH DOCTORS AND PATIENTS THROUGH GUIDELINES AND PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGNS TO CUT UNNECESSARY PRESCRIBING OF ANTIBIOTICS THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE OVER CAN CAUSE BACTERIA TO BECOME RESISTANT MAKING IT HARDER TO TREAT INFECTIONS SOMETHING THAT SEEN AS A HUGE THREAT TO PATIENTS' SAFETY
THEY'VE ALSO BEEN FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO GET G.P.S TO CUT DOWN ON PRESCRIBING THE TARGET WAS TRADUCED PRESCRIPTIONS BY ONE PER CENT FOR TOTAL FELL BY MORE THAN SEVEN PER CENT HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY IT'S A FANTASTIC RESULT
GOVERNMENTS ACROSS EUROPE ARE BEING URGED TO IMPROVE THE WAY THEY GATHER AND SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT FIREARMS IN ORDER TO CUT THE NUMBER OF DEATHS AND INJURIES FROM GUN CRIME AND TERRORISM A RESEARCH TEAM LED BY COVENTRY UNIVERSITY SAYS CRIMINALS ARE EXPLOITING LEGAL LOOPHOLES TO ACQUIRE GARDENS AND THERE ISN'T ENOUGH EMPHASIS ON INVESTIGATING THE SOURCE OF WEAPONS
THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE HAS SAID THE QUALITY OF SERVICE PROVIDED BY H.M. REVENUE AND CUSTOMS COLLAPSED BETWEEN APRIL TWENTY FOURTEEN AND LAST OCTOBER IT'S H.M.R.C. GOT ITS TIMING BADLY WRONG WHEN IT CUT THE NUMBER OF CALL HANDLERS AS HAD EXPANDED ITS ONLINE SERVICES
WHO SAYS PERFORMANCE IMPROVED WHEN NEARLY TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND EXTRA STAFF WERE RECRUITED TO THE TAXES HELPLINE THANK YOU SIX MINUTES PAST SIX LET US HAVE A LOOK AT THE WEATHER WITH PHILIP AVERY HE'S AT THE B. B. WEATHER SENT THIS MORNING AND I FELT
VERY GOOD MORNING SUE LET ME DIVIDE THE COUNTRY UP INTO THREE HORIZONTAL SLICES FIRST OF ALL THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND SOUTH WALES THE SOUTH MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLIA CLOUDIER AND COOLER FARE FOR THE MOST PART ACROSS THIS AREA THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND THERE MAYBE AT TIMES SOUTHERN AND WESTERN PARTS OF SOUTH WALES AS WELL
AS WE DRIFT THAT BIT FURTHER EAST OVER TOWARDS EAST ANGLIA IS ENOUGH CLOUD ALREADY FOR THE ODD DRIVEN DROP OF RAIN TO COME IN OFF THE NORTH SEA AND I THINK THE EASTERN SORT OF SIDE OF THE MIDLANDS PARTS OF EAST ANGLIA COULD BE AT RISK OF THE ODD SPOT OF RAIN THROUGHOUT THE DAY GIVEN THAT YOUR SKIES WILL REMAIN STUBBORNLY CLOUDY COOL TWO OVER ON THE EASTERN SIDE HERE WITH THE ABSENCE OF SUNSHINE NINE TEN ELEVEN DEGREES SOMETHING OF THAT ORDER TOWARDS THE WEST PARTICULARLY THE SOUTH WEST WE KEEP THE SUNSHINE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN COULD WELL BE YOURS
LITTLE BIT FURTHER NORTH TO THE NORTH OF WALES THE NORTH MIDLANDS ALL OF NORTHERN ENGLAND AND THE BORDERS OF SCOTLAND CERTAINLY A CLOUDY DAY HERE AND THE RAIN JUST BEGINNING TO CREEP ITS WAY IN TOWARDS THE WASH INTO THE LINCOLNSHIRE COAST WILL BECOME A GOOD DEAL MORE WIDESPREAD WITH TIME DURING THE COURSE OF SOME REALLY QUITE HEAVY ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PENNINES TO YORKSHIRE EVENTUALLY INTO NORTHUMBERLAND LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON AND COOL HERE ON THE EAST COAST NINE DEGREES OR SO AND THAT BEST ABOUT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN
AND FINALLY FOR THE BULK OF SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND CERTAINLY NORTHERN IRELAND CENTRAL AND WESTERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND SEEING THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE AND STAYING DRY THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE DAY A WEED AT WAR CLOUD THROUGHOUT THOUGH ACROSS THE NORTH EASTERN QUARTER OF SCOTLAND AND INDEED THE NORTHERN ISLES ARE HIGH HERE ARE FORTY
THANK YOU PHIL IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THEIR MORNING PAPERS NO DOMINANT STORY ACROSS THE FRONT PAGES TODAY WHICH GIVE THE PAPERS THE CHANCE TO PURSUE THEIR OWN THEMES SO THE F. T. FOR EXAMPLE LEADS ON THE RAID ON GOOGLE'S PARIS OFFICE WHICH IT SAYS RAISES THE STAKES IN THE TAX BATTLE WITH U.S. TEREK POINTING OUT THAT THE FRENCH ARE HOPING TO GET
ONE POINT SIX BILLION EUROS IN BACK TAXES FROM GOOGLE ARE PRETTY STARK CONTRAST WITH THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION IN BACK TAXES WHICH WAS THE DEAL OF COURSE DONE BETWEEN OUR OWN ATTACKS MAN AND GOOGLE WITH BACK TAXES DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE GUARDIAN
CAMPAIGNING ON THE ISSUE OF LONDON PROPERTY AND PROPERTY GENERALLY HAS A STARK PICTURE OF A SKYSCRAPER KNOWN AS THE TOWER BRITAIN'S TALLEST RESIDENTIAL SKYSCRAPER HE CALLS IT THE STARK SYMBOL OF THE HOUSING CRISIS AND IN NUMBERS SPELLS OUT WHY SIXTY TWO PER CENT TO THE FLATS FOREIGN OWNED THE PRICE OF ONE OR FIFTY ONE MILLION POUNDS AND A QUARTER OF ALL FLAT HELD THROUGH SECRETIVE OFFSHORE COMPANIES
IN TAX HAVENS THEY MALE GOES ON EUROPE HAS A PICTURE ON THE FRONT PAGE MIGRANTS ON THEIR WAY FROM LIBYA INTO ITALY ASKS THE QUESTION IS THIS WHY THE P.M. IS DODGING THE T. V. DEBATES IN JUST TWENTY FOUR HOURS TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED MIGRANTS HAVE PICKED UP ON ROUTE TO EUROPE SO MUCH FOR E.U. CLAIMS AT THE CRISIS
IS DWINDLING IN ANNETTE'S EDITORIAL THEY LET DAVID KAREN HAVE IT WITH BOTH BARRELS SO THEN WE WERE THOROUGHLY DEPRESSING DISREGARD FOR BOTH DEMOCRACY IN THE BRITISH ELECTORATE DAVID CAMERON REFUSES TO TAKE PART IN ANY OF THE HEAD TO HEAD T. V. DEBATES A DECISION THE MALE CALLS NOT JUST COWARDLY BUT AN ABROGATION OF HIS PRIME MINISTERIAL DUTY ON AN INSIDE PAGE THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH A VIDEO THAT HAS BEEN
PRODUCED BY THOSE WHO WANT US TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION QUENTIN LETTS SAYS PROJECT FAIR MATTER BECOME PROJECT DEAR OH DEAR THE AGEING DAD EARS HAVE REMAINED POSSIBLY THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTIN ON DOWN WITH TODAY'S YOUNG THINGS BUT YESTERDAY'S TWENTY FOUR SAME CAMPAIGN VIDEO WILL MAKE TOES CURL LIKE BINDWEED AND IT'S A VIDEO WHICH USES WHICH JUST LEAVES THE GENIE OFF QUITE A LOT OF WORDS IN A WAY THAT THEY SEEM TO THINK YOUNG PEOPLE DO WORK IN LEARNIN IN RAVE IN CHATTIN
ROME IN MAKING MEETING SHARAN GOING LOVIN AND THEN THIS LEADS TO THE BIG ONE FOLKS VOTE HIM IN SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE SAYS QUENTIN LETTS THERE LOADED VOTE IN AND TURNED IT INTO A PRESENT PARTICIPLE AN ACT OF GENIUS SHAKESPEARE HIMSELF WOULD BE ENVIOUS OF SUCH WORKER JUSTIN WE'RE TURNING UP ON RADIO ONE XTRA SHORTLY THE SON IS OBSESSED AS YOU KNOW WITH EUROPE BUT NOT THE EUROPE YOU'RE THINKING OF IT'S THE EUROS OR TWENTY SIXTEEN CHAMPIONSHIPS OF COURSE THEY'RE FROM PAGE HEADLINE THEY THINK IT'S ALL SOBER
ENGLAND V. WALES IN FRANCE NO BOOZE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE KICK OFF IT'S ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX PROTESTS OUTSIDE A DONALD TRUMP RALLY IN NEW MEXICO LAST NIGHT TEN QUITE VIOLENT PROTESTERS DEMONSTRATORS THROWING BURNING T. SHIRTS PLASTIC BOTTLES OTHER ITEMS
THE POLICE OVER TURN TRASH CANS IN THE STREET NOT DOWN BARRICADES THE POLICE FIRED PEPPER SPRAY THERE WERE SMOKE GRENADES AS WELL ALL OF THAT OUTSIDE THE ALBUQUERQUE CONVENTION CENTRE A NEW MEXICO THE BIG ARGUMENT OF COURSE BETWEEN THE DEMONSTRATORS AND THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AS BASICALLY ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION OR ACCORDING TO TRUMP'S OPPONENTS HERE'S RACISM WE'LL BE HEARING A REPORT LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME FROM GEMMA'S BEEN TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO FIND OUT WHY AMERICANS ARE SO DIVIDED
ON THE SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION AND ONE OF THOSE HE'S BEEN SPEAKING TO IS KEVIN FALCONER WHO IS THE REPUBLICAN MAYOR OF SAN DIEGO BORDER CITY OF COURSE BIG HISPANIC POPULATION WHO FACES HIS OWN RE ELECTION CAMPAIGN THIS YEAR
WE LOOK AT OUR RELATIONSHIP OF MEXICO AND BEEN ON THE BORDER IS THE LARGEST BORDER SEALANT IN NORTH AMERICA IT'S A STRENGTH AND ANY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE IS MEYER
WE HAVE A PARTICULARLY STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ONE WHICH IS OF COURSE THAT THE LARGER CITY JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER WE'VE LOOKED AT OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW WE CAN GROW OUR ECONOMIC TAX HOW WE CAN GROW OUR CULTURAL TIES AND OBVIOUSLY IF WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER EVERY SINGLE DAY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
WE'VE REALLY TRIED TO LOOK AT IT IS NOT TWO CITIES I'M DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE BORDER BUT ONE REGION
AND SO I VIEW I THINK MOST SCENIC VIEW OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WITTY WHILE IN OUR AND OUR BORDER RELATIONSHIPS AS A HUGE STRENGTH CLEARLY THE QUESTION OF HOW TO DEAL WITH UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES AND THEIR DESCENDANTS HAVE BEEN HIM AND MAKE US FOR A LONG TIME IT'S A FEDERAL QUESTION THAT'S QUESTION THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE END FLASHED OUT IN WASHINGTON HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK IT IS
FRONT FOR THE GOOD HEALTH OF YOU CITY QUITE APART FROM WHAT YOU WHAT YOU FEEL AS A HUMAN BEING
THAT THAT THAT IS SOME KIND OF SOLUTION TO THAT QUESTION IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS I'VE SAID VERY CLEARLY WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY AS A NATION IN SOFTNESS IN IT IN IT WILL REQUIRE EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER I'M CONVINCED THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN I'M CONVINCED THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE THE LEAD OF WHAT YOU SEE IN CITIES AND JUST LIKE OURS THAT ARE ON THE BOARD
OF WORKING TOGETHER TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE THAT AND AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE PUTTING ASIDE LABELS AND SAYING HOW WAS IT THAT WE SOLVE PROBLEMS YEAH WHAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT IN A RATIONAL WAY
IF A LOT OF MONEY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF LABOUR IS SPENT TRYING TO BUILD UP
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BUT I'VE SAID OUR BEST OPPORTUNITIES IS BUILDING BRIDGES AND I MEAN THAT MUCH TO ME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
JIM THERE WILL HE BE HEARING MORE FROM HIM AFTER SEVEN THIRTY NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX GUN CRIME COULD BE CUT IF POLICE FORCES ACROSS EUROPE WERE QUICKER TO TEST THE BULLETS TO TEST THE EXPLOSIVE RESIDUE IS LEFT BEHIND A CRIME SCENE SOUND SIMPLE BUT IT IS A CRUCIAL FINDING OF A NEW REPORT WHICH IS BEING PUBLISHED TODAY DANNY SURE JOINT IS ON THE LINE TO TELL US MORE HE OF COURSE IS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MORNING TO YOU DANNY WHO'S REPORTING TO YOU
THIS IS A REPORT LED BY COVENTRY UNIVERSITY OVER FIFTEEN MONTHS AND TO BE PRESENTED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN BRUSSELS TODAY AND IT COMES UP WITH THIRTY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE WAY INTELLIGENCE IS SHARED ACROSS EUROPE IMPROVING THEIR STANDARDS OF INVESTIGATION OF GUN CRIME ACROSS EUROPE
BUT WHAT'S PERHAPS ALARMING ABOUT IT IS IT RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT HOW GUN CRIME IS TACKLED AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GUN CRIME IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO TACKLE THE TRADE IN WEAPONS ACROSS EUROPE INCONSISTENCIES IN THE WAY CRIME DATA IS COMPILED THAT MEANS IT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE TO GIVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE EXTENT OF GUN CRIME ACROSS EUROPE
AND A NUMBER OF LEGAL LOOPHOLES THAT CAN BE EXPLOITED BY CRIMINALS IN TERMS OF FOR EXAMPLE THE DEACTIVATION OF WEAPONS AND THE STATUS OF ANTIQUE WEAPONS AND WHY THIS IS RELEVANT TO US IN THE U.K. IT'S RELEVANT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WEAPONS ARE COMING INTO BRITAIN FROM COUNTRIES ACROSS EUROPE THERE IS A MARKET A THRIVING MARKET IN ILLEGAL FIREARMS THAT STRETCHES ACROSS BORDERS INTRIGUING THAT THEY
STUDY DIDN'T THEY THE CARTRIDGE CASES FROM SERBIA TO LOOK AT WHETHER THEY WERE LINKED TO OTHER SHOOTINGS ELSEWHERE YES I THINK THIS THIS WAS TO EMPHASISE HOW IF YOU ACTUALLY CONDUCT SOME CLOSE ANALYSIS OF
BALLISTICS MATERIAL THAT ISN'T THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE ALREADY YOU CAN SEE LINKS BETWEEN DIFFERENT CASES THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLORED IN OTHER COUNTRIES A THOUSAND GUN CARTRIDGE CASES FROM SERBIA WHICH DOESN'T HAVE A SORT OF BALLISTICS EXAMINATION FACILITY ITSELF WERE LOOKED AT THEY FOUND LINKS TO FIFTY SHOOTINGS MOST OF THOSE SHOOTINGS HADN'T PREVIOUSLY BEEN DISCOVERED
AND THEY WERE POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS TO CASES CRIME CRIME'S IN MACEDONIA KOSOVO IN SWEDEN SO THAT JUST SHOWS YOU THAT EXAMINATION THAT MATERIAL OF HOW WIDESPREAD AT THE GUN CONNECTIONS CAN BE THE CRUCIAL THING I THINK THIS REPORT REALLY SAYS IS THERE MUST BE MORE FOCUS ON INVESTIGATING THE SOURCE THE SUPPLY OF A WEAPON
AND THE HISTORY OF ITS MOVEMENT IN CRIMINAL CIRCLES BECAUSE WEAPONS AREN'T JUST USED FOR ONE CRIME BY ONE CRIMINAL THEY ARE SPREAD AND TRANSFERRED ACROSS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND CURSES DANNY SEAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
SIXTY MINUTES PAST SIX NOT JUST TATA STEEL OR WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY ON THE JOBS FRONT BUT ALSO THE FATE OF THE RETAIL OF B.H.S. COULD BE KNOWN APPARENTLY WITHIN DAYS AS A NEW BIDDER FOR THE FAILED BUSINESS SEEMS TO HAVE EMERGED THAT AND ALL THE REST DAYS BUSINESS FROM ROB YES GOOD MORNING THE SAVIOURS OF THE HIGH STREET CHAIN B.H.S. COULD TURN OUT TO BE AN UNLIKELY TEAM OF A SWISS BANKER A RICH PORTUGUESE FAMILY AND THE BROTHER OF THE FORMER ENGLAND CRICKETER PHIL TUFNELL GREG TUFNELL HE USED TO RUN MOTHER CARE AND BURTON MENSWEAR
HE'S LEADING RICH S. GROUP A NEWLY FORMED INVESTMENT OUTFIT AND IT IS THOUGHT TO BE THE FRONTRUNNER TO RESCUE B.H.S. SOURCES CLOSE TO THE SALES PROCESS SAY IF NO BUYER IS FOUND BY FRIDAY B.H.S. IS LIKELY TO BE LIQUIDATED THAT WOULD PUT THE RETAILERS ELEVEN THOUSAND STAFF OUT OF WORK OR WITH US HAS ROBERT POLLARD CONSULTANT AT PARTNERS IN RETAIL YOU WORKED AT B.H.S. IN ITS HEYDAY IN THE LATE SEVENTIES MORNING ROBERT GOOD MORNING WHY DO YOU THINK THE SALE PROCESS HAS BEEN DRAGGING ON AND ON
I THINK IT'S FINDING THE RIGHT PERSON WHO CAN TAKE ON THE BUSINESS WHO'S GOT THE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO DELIVER THE KIND OF SUPPORT THE BUSINESS IS GOING TO NEED IF IT'S GOING TO SUCCEED IN THE FUTURE BUT THIS NEW BETTER WHICH HAS EMERGED LED BY GREG TUFNELL HE HAS CONSIDERABLE RETAIL EXPERIENCE IS THAT THE KIND OF BUYER THAT THE ADMINISTRATORS ARE LOOKING FOR
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WHOEVER TAKES OVER B.H.S. HAS SOME GOOD RETAIL CREDENTIALS COS I THINK THAT THE PAST TWELVE OR FIFTEEN MONTHS OF SHOWING THAT THAT'S DESPERATELY WHAT THE BUSINESS NEEDS BUT I THINK MOST OF ALL WHAT BUSINESS NEEDS IS A VISION SOMEBODY YOU CAN REALLY CREATE A VERY CLEAR IDENTITY FOR WHAT B.H.S. IS GOING TO BE ON THE HIGH STREET AND WHAT IT MEANS TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHAT DO YOU THINK B.H.S. THEN CAN BE SAVED IN ITS CURRENT FORM IN THE SENSE OF THE NUMBER OF STORES AND STAFFORD
I'M NOT PRIVY TO ALL THE DETAILS BUT I WOULD THINK IT'S UNLIKELY THAT ALL THE STORES COULD BE SAVED I THINK THEY HAVE THE C.V.A. PROCESS THAT THE BUSINESS WENT THROUGH A FAIRLY RECENTLY INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SCORES THAT WEREN'T PERFORMING PARTICULARLY WELL SO I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A QUESTION MARK OVER WHETHER ALL HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR STORES WILL SURVIVE
BUT HOPEFULLY THE VAST MAJORITY WELL SO YOU THINK THAT B.H.S. WILL SURVIVE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT LIQUIDATORS ARE STANDING BY TO WIND UP B.H.S. HAVE A DEAL ISN'T DONE
WELL THAT'S THE PART OF THE PROCESS THAT B.H.S. IS ENTERED INTO GOING INTO ADMINISTRATION THERE ARE TWO ROUTES OUT OF IT ONE IS LIQUIDATION AND THE OTHER IS A BUYER WHO SAVES THE BUSINESS AND THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'VE PUT FORWARD BITS FOR THE BUSINESS AND OBVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATORS ROLE IS TO GET THE THE BEST
RESULT FOR EVERYBODY CONCERNED B. THAT SUPPLIERS PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE BUSINESS PENSIONERS AND SO ON WHERE THE TROUBLES AT B.H.S. WERE FIRST MADE PUBLIC IT WAS A BIT OF A BOOST IN SALES BUT HAS DAMAGE BEEN DONE TO THE CHAIN WHILE WE'VE ALL BEEN AWAITING ITS FATE
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE OTHER THAN IN THE SENSE THAT HE'S BEEN ON A VERY STRONG PROMOTIONAL STANCE SINCE THAT PROCESS STARTED AND THE END RESULT OF THAT IS OBVIOUSLY YOU START TO SELL THROUGH YOUR STOCK AND THE QUESTION IS HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO REPLENISH THAT STALK DURING THAT PROCESS AND HAVE THEY GOT ENOUGH STOCK TO SUSTAIN THEIR BUSINESS GOING FORWARD IF B.H.S. IS ULTIMATELY WOUND UP WHAT DO YOU THINK IT TELLS US ABOUT THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE BRITISH HIGH STREET
I THINK WHAT IT TELLS US IS THAT EVERY BUSINESS HAS A LIFE CYCLE AND WE'VE SEEN IT WITH COMPANIES LIKE BOSWORTH SON LITTLEWOODS AND EVEN PEOPLE LIKE C. N. A. IT CERTAINLY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT
THEY HAVE TO EVOLVE AND CHANGE TO BE RELEVANT TO TODAY'S CUSTOMERS AND THAT'S A CONTINUAL PROCESS IF YOU STOP ON THAT JOURNEY AT ANY POINT YOU RISK FALLING OFF THE EDGE
O.K. THANK YOU ROBERT ROBERT POLLARD FROM PARTNERS IN RETAIL MARKETS GUESS THIS MORNING IS MIKE AMY THE MANAGING DIRECTOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT PIMLICO ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DEBT INVESTORS IT MANAGERS ABOUT ONE TRILLION POUNDS WORTH OF ASSETS MORNING MIKE GOOD MORNING BRIEFLY ON B.H.S. YOU'RE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A GOOD INVESTMENT AREN'T YOU DOES B.H. AIR STRIKE YOU AS SUCH A BUSINESS
I THINK AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY STRESSFUL TIME FOR THE FOR THE PEOPLE INVOLVED I THINK I THINK THE CHALLENGE WITH B.H.S. AND ITS CURRENT FORMAT IS IS TWOFOLD ONE IS THAT AS YOUR PREVIOUS GUESS WAS MENTIONING THEIR UNDERLYING BUSINESS LOOKS LIKE IT IT'S UNDER SEVERE STRESS
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS GRAND SET ABOUT THE PENSION LIABILITIES I THINK IN TRUTH AND IN ITS IN ITS ENTIRETY WHEN I HADN'T SEEN THE BOOKS BUT IT SEEMS PRETTY TOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT IT COULD BE IT COULD BE
GOOD INVESTMENT QUOTE IN ITS ENTIRETY RIGHT O.K. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE THE GREEK FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS BEEN DRAGGING ON FOR YEARS OF COURSE WILL OVERNIGHT EUROZONE FINANCE MINISTERS HAVE AGREED TO GIVE ATHENS ANOTHER EIGHT BILLION POUNDS IN BAILOUT FUNDS BUT PERHAPS MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THEY'VE ALSO AGREED TO PHASE IN DEBT RELIEF IN TWO YEARS' TIME A KEY DEMAND OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE HEAD OF THE GROUP YOUR OWN DICE HOODLUM CALLED IT A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY THAT I'VE HEARD IT TWICE NOW THAT THE PACKAGE IS NOT AMBITIOUS I THINK PUT EUROPE IS PUT ON THE TABLE HERE SHORT MEDIUM TERM AS A SORT OF A FALL BACK ALSO THE MECHANISM IS SOMETHING THAT A MONTH AGO I DON'T I COULDN'T HAVE DREAMT OF THAT THE MINISTERS WOULD HAVE AGREED
SO I THINK THE MINISTERS HAVE STRETCHED THEIR POLITICAL CAPITAL TO PUT THIS ON THE TABLE
MIKE HOW IMPORTANT A STEP DO YOU THINK THIS DEBT RELIEF IS IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP BECAUSE GREECE IS IN A SITUATION WHEREBY I THINK MOST COMMENTATORS DON'T EXPECT THE GREEKS TO BE IN A POSITION TO PAY BACK ALL OF THEIR DEBT THE GREEKS THEMSELVES HAVE KIND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT
AND WE NEED TO GET THAT ON THE TABLE SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP THE CHALLENGE WE'VE GOT OF COURSE IS THAT WE TEND TO FIND WITH THE GREAT SITUATION IT'S YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO STEPS FORWARD AND THEN AND THEN SOMETHING COMES ALONG AND THERE'S ONE STEP BACK AND THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE TO STEP FORWARD MOVEMENTS SO SIR GOOD NEWS ABSOLUTELY THE MONEY THEY REALLY DON'T NEED UNTIL TILL JULY SO AGAIN GOOD NEWS THEY'VE AGREED IT NOW
RATHER THAN WAITING TILL THE LAST MINUTE WHICH IS HISTORICALLY HOW THESE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THOSE CALLING FOR UPFRONT AND UNCONDITIONAL DEBT RELIEF AND THIS DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE THAT NO AND THE INTEREST OF MONETARY FUND IS UNDER PRESSURE ITSELF AND ON THE ONE HAND WHAT YOU'VE GOT IT'S IN SUCH A MUNCH CRUNCH A LOT OF MONEY INTO INTEGRATOR RELATIVE TO THE CAPITAL PAID UP AT THE ARMOUR SO THE ARMY HEAVILY COMMITTED TO TO GREECE AND IS RECEIVING SOME PRESSURE FROM OTHER PART FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE ARMOUR SO WHY HAVE YOU MADE THE SPECIAL DISPENSATIONS TOO TO GREECE FOR THE I.M.F. HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE ON THE ONE HAND
AND THEN THE NORTHERN EUROPEANS AND THE OTHER HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THEY NEED THEIR BELIEF INDICTABLE THERE WERE SOUNDING UPBEAT EVERYONE WILL BE TALKING UP THE GREEK SITUATION AS A DEBT INVEST THAT MAKE MAKE YOU HAPPY TO PILE INTO A LOAD OF GREEK GOVERNMENT BONDS I THINK THE GREECE STILL HAS A LOT OF LONG TERM CHALLENGES ANY TRUE MOST OF IT WHAT MOST OF IT IS OWNED BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR THEY STAY SO NO BUT BUT IF YOU IN EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO BE QUITE TOUGH TO FIND
ALL RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT GOOGLE THE FRENCH OFFICERS HAVE GOOGLE WERE RAIDED AS PART OF A TAX FRAUD INVESTIGATION IT'S ACCUSED OF MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS IN UNPAID TAX AS A RATHER DIFFERENT APPROACH TO H.M. AUSSIE HERE OF COURSE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO GOOGLE AND FRIENDS WILL GOOGLE AND MANY OF THESE COMPANIES COMPANIES HAVE A HAVE A
INTERESTING SITUATION IN THAT THEY CAN WET WHERE THEY CHOOSE TO TO BOOK PROFIT SO TO SPEAK IS SOMETHING WHICH IS THEY HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY ON AND I THINK THIS IS JUST THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS A VERY VERY TOUGH
ENVIRONMENT WHERE CORPORATION TAX LOOKS LIKE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S LOST IT'S LOST STEP WITH WITH THE WAY THE COMPANIES ARE RUN AND MAYBE THIS IS THE LATEST MANIFESTATION IN THAT BUT BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW SALES TAXES PROBABLY A CLEANER ROUTE AND TRYING TO CHASE CORPORATION TAX ROUND THE WORLD
O.K. THANK YOU MIKE I CAME WITH THEIR MANAGING DIRECTOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT PIMLICO WILL STEEL MAKERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD ARE URGING THE LEADERS OF THE G. SEVEN COUNTRIES MEETING IN JAPAN TO TAKE JOINT ACTION AGAINST CHINESE STEEL DUMPING TRAY GROUPS FROM THE U.S. EUROPE CANADA JAPAN AND THE U.K. WINNING WORLD LEADERS THAT STEEL MAKERS WILL REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE UNTIL ACTION IS TAKEN THIS ON THE DAY THE BOARD OF TARTAR IN INDIA AS MEETING TO DISCUSS BIDS FOR PORT TALBOT AND AS OTHER
YOU CAISTEAL OPERATION FOR BIDS ARE UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED FOR THE BUSINESS BUT ALSO HER SIGHTS AT NEWPORT AND ROTHERHAM WITH US IS PETER BRENNAN STEEL ANALYST AND EDITOR OF S. AND P. GLOBAL PLAITS A COMMODITY PRICE REPORTING AGENCY MORNING PETER MORNING
ON TART OFF FIRST OF ALL THE BIDS HAVE COME FROM A MANAGEMENT BUY OUT VEHICLE EXCALIBUR SAND YOU'VE GOT DOES LIBERTY HOUSE INJURES J. S. W. STEEL AND GREY BALL CAPITAL WHICH COMPANY DO YOU THINK IS MOST LIKELY TO BE VICTOR IT'S IS AN INTERESTING ONE YOU'VE GOT THE MANAGEMENT LED BY OUTS WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY LOOKING AT RUNNING THE OPERATIONS AS A PREVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN WITH THE BLAST FURNACE ROOTS WHICH A LOT OF ANALYSTS WOULD SAY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO THEN YOU'VE GOT
THE ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE ROUTE FIRM LIBERTY AND AND MY AT WHICH AGAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS A VIABLE BUSINESS BECAUSE THAT PRODUCES A TYPE OF STEEL WHICH MAY BE AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIES DO NOT WANT IT'S NOT QUITE AS GOOD A QUALITY AS A BLAST FURNACE ROUTE JESTER MASSIVELY INDEBTED ENGRAVE ALL HAVE ACTUALLY BOUGHT ANOTHER PART OF TATA'S BUSINESS
THEY HAVE THE LEES GOT FORM IN HISTORY FOR IT IT'S VERY UNCLEAR THAT AS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND GIVEN THE THE VARIOUS PLEDGES FROM THE GOVERNMENT IS IT CLEAR THAT TARTAR WILL ABSOLUTELY SELL TO SOMEBODY
I KNOW NOTHING NOTHING'S CERTAIN AT ALL BUT WHAT YOU CAN SAY IS THAT EUROPEAN STEEL PRICES HAVE RISEN ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT SO FAR THIS YEAR WE'RE COMING TO A VERY IMPORTANT POINT OF THE YEAR WHERE THEY WILL SIGN THEIR SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR CONTRACTS FOR AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCES WHITE GOODS ENDS USERS SO PRO POTENTIALLY IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THEIR PROFIT OR LOSS RESULTS FOR THE NEXT AFTER YEAR ARE GOING TO BE A LOT MORE APPETISING FOR A BUYER
WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE BUSINESS SECRETARY SANDRA JAVID ON THE WELSH FIRST MINISTER CARWYN JAMES JAMES OR IN MUMBAI AT THE SAME TIME AS TARTARS BOARD MEETING THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT COULD TAKE UP TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF CARTER'S U.K. BUSINESS SO WHAT WHAT DOES THERE LIKELY ROLE IN DISCUSSIONS WILL THEY BE OFFERING MONEY
WELL I MEAN IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW HOW CONFIDENT THE INVESTORS ARE THE POTENTIAL BUYERS HOW MUCH REAL INTEREST I THINK MISTER GROUPS FOR INSTANCE WERE LIBERTY IS VERY KEEN ON GETTING GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF GREEN STILL PRODUCTION TERMS OF CHEAP ENERGY ADDRESSING SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY CRUCIAL TO TATA STEEL'S DEMISE REALLY DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT COULD END UP HAVING TO TAKE HER A BIGGER STAKE
IN THE BUSINESS WHAT'S ROLAND SOMEWAY MIGHT HAVE TO BE BIGGER THAN ITS PREVIOUSLY SAID GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY OF HUGH AND ENIF ANYBODY MAY WELL END UP BUYING IT WHERE THERE ARE LIMITATIONS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION STATED RULES SO THESE SORTS OF REGULATIONS ARE ONES THAT THEY'RE CAREFULLY TRYING TO GET AROUND THESE COULD BE POTENTIAL FACTORS THAT WILL LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF INVOLVEMENT THAT THEY HAVE HAD A TWENTY FIVE CENT STAKE IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IN OUR OUTCOME REALLY
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE GLOBAL STEEL MAKERS CALLING ON G.SEVEN LEADERS TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST CHINA'S OVERPRODUCTION AS THEY SEE IT OF STEEL CHINA HAS ALREADY CUT PRODUCTION MEANING MANY MANY JOB LOSSES IN CHINA AND THE U.S. THAT YOU WERE ALREADY PUT TARIFFS ON CHINESE STEAL WHAT MORE CAN THEY DO AND CAN IT REALLY BE COORDINATED
I MEAN EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION ON IT I MEAN CHINA OBVIOUSLY GUIDE STEEL PRICES BUT IT PRODUCES FIFTY PERCENT OF WORLD STEEL SO IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU ARE A SOUTH EAST ASIAN RE ROLLER WHO NEEDS CHEAP SLAP SUPPLY OF STEEL TO THEN MAKE YOUR PRODUCT AND YOU WANT CHEAP CHINESE STEAL COS I WAS YOU CAN'T COMPETE ON THE GLOBAL MARKET SO
CAN THERE BE BILATERAL EVERYONE'S GOT A DIFFERENT GAME SO IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU PETER PETER FROM S. AND P. GLOBAL PLATZ FOR YOU WAIT TO HEAR NEWS FROM TOSH AT SOME POINT OVER THE NEXT DAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ROB IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX CHRIS DENNIS IS HERE WITH THE SPORTS NEWS MY CRISP MORNING TUNIC YES RUSSIA'S MINISTER FOR SPORT HAS ADMITTED TO THE B. B. C. THAT THE POSITIVE TESTS FOR DOPING BY FOURTEEN OF THE COUNTRY'S ATHLETES AT THE BEIJING OLYMPICS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD
THE NAMES OF THE ATHLETES FROM THREE DIFFERENT SPORTS WON'T BE RELEASED UNTIL THE BE SAMPLES HAVE BEEN TESTED BUT FIVE BRITISH ATHLETE STAND TO BE AWARDED RETROSPECTIVE BRONZE MEDALS HERE IS THE RUSSIAN SPORTS MINISTER THE THALI WOULD COPE
WHEN YOUR SLAYER AUTHOR CERTAINLY IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD BUT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT THE RUSSIAN NATIONAL TEAM IS THE SECOND BIGGEST AFTER A YEAR OR SO AND REPRESENTED BY MANY LEADERS IN THEIR DISCIPLINES HERE SO THIS DOESN'T GIVE AN OBJECTIVE PICTURE WITH A CLOAKING SITUATION IN RUSSIA
RUSSIAN I THINK SIR CURRENTLY BANNED FROM ALL INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND A DECISION ON WHETHER TO LET THEM COMPETE AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN RIO WILL BE TAKEN ON JUNE THE SEVENTEENTH MANCHESTER UNITED AND WILL MEET FOR A SECOND DAY TODAY TO TRY TO CONCLUDE A DEAL WHICH WOULD SEE THE PORTUGUESE NAMED OF THE CLUB'S NEW MANAGER THE FORMER UNITED COACH READY MILIND BELIEVES WILL BE A POSITIVE APPOINTMENT THE TWISTERS AND SOMETIMES A BUMMER WHEN YOU'RE IN TERMS OF BEEN EDITED DOWN THE OTHER
DOCTORS WERE YOU TWO SCORING GOALS YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN MY GUESS WOULD BE PARTY OR WE MAY WANT TO HOLD ON TO HER LEAD AND I THINK THAT WAS WHAT MY YOUR WISHES HE'S VERY GOOD UP ANDY MURRAY HAS DENIED THAT HE'S ON COURT RANTING WAS THE REASON FOR PARTING COMPANY FROM HIS COACH FAMILY MANY SMOKED THE FRENCH ONE SET IN A RECENT INTERVIEW THAT HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SOMETIMES CONFUSING I SAW THAT

WHICH HE'S RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE E.U. IN THE PAST AS A PAID UP PROPAGANDA ARM OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
A DOZEN FORMER SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE WARNED THAT E.U. POLICIES ARE UNDERMINING THE U.K.'S COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS IN A LETTER TO THE GUARDIAN THEY EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR BRECHT'S IT SAYING NATO OR NOT THE Y. YOU SHOULD BE THE CORNERSTONE OF EUROPE'S DEFENCE THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN SAYS MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. AND NATO IS NOT CONTRADICTORY
EUROZONE FINANCE MINISTERS HAVE AGREED TO UNLOCK ANOTHER TEN BILLION EUROS AROUND A BILLION POUNDS IN BAIL OUT FUNDS TO GREECE AFTER TALKS IN BRUSSELS THEY ALSO AGREED TO PHASE IN DEBT RELIEF IN TWO YEARS' TIME SAYING THE DEAL HAD BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY GRACE'S CONTINUED ECONOMIC REFORMS THE ITALIAN COASTGUARD SAYS IT RESCUED THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE YESTERDAY AS THEY TRY TO CROSS TO EUROPE FROM NORTH AFRICA MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND WERE RESCUED THE DAY BEFORE

THE HEALTH WATCHDOG THE CARE QUALITY COMMISSION SAYS NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE CARE HOMES IN ENGLAND HE'D PREVIOUSLY RATED INADEQUATE HAVE NOW IMPROVED THEIR C.Q. SEES REPORT CLAIMS TOUGHER REGULATIONS ARE PUSHING UP STANDARDS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHRIS IT IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN SICK OF THE HE SAID SHE SAID ROW ABOUT WHETHER WILL BE POORER OR RICHER IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. THE ECONOMIC GURUS OF THE EYE FIRST THE INSTITUTE OF FISCAL STUDIES CAN BE TRUSTED TO TELL THE TRUTH
OR CAMP MATE NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR LET'S HEAR WHAT THEY DO SAY FIRST NORMAN BEFORE WE HEAR WHAT THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THEM SAY IN REPLY
WE HAVE TO SAY NICK THEIR CONCLUSIONS SEEM TO ME TO CONTAIN SOME FAIRLY BRUISING ASSESSMENTS FOR THE BREASTS BRECHT'S IT CAMP
THEY SUGGEST CLAIMS THAT WE PAY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK TO THE E.U. AND WE COULD GET THIS MONEY BACK HAVE WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION TO SPEND ON OUR OWN PRIORITIES ARE IN THEIR VIEWS QUOTES INAPPROPRIATE WRONG AND ABSURD THEY SAY THE TRUE FIGURE ONCE YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REBATE IN MONEY YOU PAYS BACK TO US IT'S PROBABLY HALF THAT MAY JUST BE A QUARTER OF THAT IF WE HAVE A SIMILAR SORT OF DEAL AS NORWAY HAS
THEY CONCLUDE BY THE END OF THIS PARLIAMENT THE PUBLIC FINANCES WILL TAKE A HIT TO THE TUNE OF TWENTY TO FORTY BILLION THAT SUCH A SCALE OF ADDITIONAL BORROWING COULD NOT BE MADE UP BY CUTS OR TAX RISES BECAUSE IT JUST WOULD NOT BE POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE BETWEEN ONE TO TWO YEARS OF ADDITIONAL AUSTERITY AND THREE BY TWENTY THIRTY A PUBLIC FINANCES WERE PROBABLY WORSE OFF BY AROUND FORTY BILLIONS LESS CASH TO SPEND ON
PUBLIC SERVICES AND SO ON BUT THEIR ONE ABSOLUTE OVERRIDING CONCLUSION IS SET ASIDE ALL THE FORECASTS AND DIFFERENT POSSIBLE OUTCOMES THERE ONE ABSOLUTE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE ECONOMY WILL TAKE A HIT
IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW YOU CAN ARGUE QUITE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT HIT WE CAN GET BACK CREDIT CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS SOVEREIGNTY OF INDEPENDENCE BUT THE EYE F. S. A CLEAR UNDER BRECHT'S IT THE ECONOMY TAKES A HIT NORMALLY PEOPLE CAN DISPUTE THE FINDINGS THEY RARELY THOSE SAY WHAT THE VOTE LEAVE LEVER SAYING ABOUT THEY ARE FIRST REGARDED OFTEN HAS A SORT OF INDEPENDENT GURUS WHICH IS DON'T LISTEN TO THESE GUYS THEY'RE IN THE PAY OF BROTH
THEIR EXACT PHRASES THEY SAY THEY ARE PAID UP PROPAGANDA ARM OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WHEN THERE ARE OTHER CRITICISMS THEY SAY THE IFE S. HAVE GOT THEIR FIGURES WRONG IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE GIVE TO THE E.U. THEY FAILED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF STAYING IN THE E.U. BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME ACCUSINGLY I F. S. OF BEING A BRANCH OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE THRASHING THE BALL INTO THE BACK OF YOUR OWN NET WHEN IT COMES TO
THE CREDIBILITY ISSUE BECAUSE IF THIS REFERENDUM DOES COME DOWN TO AN ISSUE OF SIMPLY WHO DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THEN IT DOES SEEM THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS BACKING UP A WHOLE LOAD OF INDEPENDENT NON POLITICAL ORGANISATIONS WHO BROADLY SHARE THEIR VIEWS ON THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF BRECHT'S AT AND THE EYE AFFAIRS
FRANKLY THEIR REPORTS ARE PRETTY MUCH VIEWED AS MOSES DELIVERING A TABLET OF STONE THEY CARRY HUGE HUGE OF TH ORATORY AND THAT MATTERS MASSIVELY IN THE ARGUMENT OVER CREDIBILITY NORMAN THANK YOU MOSES WILL BE HERE IN THE SHAPE OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE I.R.S. PAUL JOHNSON AFTER TEN PAST EIGHT AS WELL THAT JOHN WHERE DO I DO I SUSPECT WISHES TO SMASH THOSE TABLETS OF STONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN LOOK AT THE PAPERS BRITAIN TOPS FOREIGN AID SPENDING LEAGUE IS THE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH PAPERS ONE OF SEVERAL TO REPORT FIGURES PRODUCED FOR THE G.SEVEN GROUP OF COUNTRIES SHOWS THAT THE U.K. IS THE ONLY MAJOR ECONOMY MEETING A U.N. TARGET TO SPEND NOT POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF NATIONAL INCOME ON FOREIGN AID THE TELEGRAPH SAYS BRITAIN IS SPENDING TWICE AS MUCH AS ITS NATIONAL WEALTH
ON AID AS OTHER NATIONS THE SUN SAYS THAT TIME WHEN THE N.H.S. FINANCES ARE IN CRISIS WHAT IT CALLS THE MONSTROUS GIVEAWAY IS INSANE THE DAILY EXPRESS SAYS HIS MADNESS TO JUDGE THE SUCCESS OF A FOREIGN AID PROGRAMME BY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY LAVISHED UPON IT RATHER THAN THE RESULTS THAT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED AND THAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE'S TAXES HAVE BEEN SPENT ON POINTLESS PROJECTS OR EMBEZZLED BY CORRUPT FOREIGN OFFICIALS DOWNING STREET RESPONDING TO ALL OF SAYING BRITAIN'S AID BUDGET IS AN ENORMOUS FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD THE TIME SAYS THAT SOCIAL WORKERS ARE BEING SWAMPED
WITH REPORTS OF SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND THEY'RE WASTING THEIR TIME INVESTIGATING INNOCENT FAMILIES RESEARCHERS WHO OBTAINED INFORMATION FROM MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED COUNCILS IN ENGLAND CLAIM ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN BORN IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND NINE TO TWO THOUSAND TEN HAS BEEN REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES AT SOME POINT A TEAM FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL LANCASHIRE BELIEVE A CLIMATE OF FEAR CREATED BY HIGH PROFILE CASES HAS LED TO SPIRALLING NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS WHICH IS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR SOCIAL WORKERS
TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN IN GENUINE DANGER THEY'D EMAIL ATTEMPTS TO PUT MORE PRESSURE ON DAVID CAMERON TO AGREE TO A HEAD TO HEAD TELEVISION DEBATE WITH ONE OF HIS LEADING CONSERVATIVE OPPONENTS IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND ITS COMMENT COLUMN THE PAPER ACCUSES THE PRIME MINISTER OF DISREGARDING DEMOCRACY BY REFUSING TO ALLOW HIS ARGUMENTS TO BE PROBED AND TESTED THE MAIL SAYS HE'S RECKLESSLY EXAGGERATED THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE FAIRS EXPOSURE IF HE FACES A DEBATER AS SKILLED AS BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO
THE TELEGRAPH THERE WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IN PUTTING ACROSS ITS ARGUMENTS IT SAYS MY JOHNSON OR MY GAVE HER FAILING TO MATCH REMAIN BLOW FOR BLOW ESPECIALLY ON ECONOMICS AND THE CAMPAIGN'S MESSAGES HAVE TOO OFTEN BEEN DIFFUSE AND FLEETING WITH A MONTH TO GO TO THE REFERENDUM THE PAPER SAYS THERE IS STILL ALL TO PLAY FOR AND HE VERGES REMAINED TO MAKE A COMPELLING AND EMOTIVE CASE FOR A BRITAIN PROUDLY INDEPENDENT AND FREE OF THE STIFLING INFLUENCE OR BRUSSELS
AND TWENTY FOUR HOUR DRINKING BAN TO BE IMPOSED ON ENGLAND AND WALES FANS WHO TRAVELLED TO THE FRENCH TOWN OF LANCE NEXT MONTH IS REPORTED MANY PAPERS FRENCH POLICE SEARCH SUPPORTERS AND FIND THEM IF THEY'RE CARRYING ALCOHOL AND INTENT TO AVERT ANY VIOLENCE ON THE DAY THE TEAMS MEET AT EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN MY MOTHER TELEGRAPH SAYS THE PLACE IN THE U.K. WILL MONITOR SMARTPHONE FOOTAGE POSTED ONLINE TO CATCH ANY HOOLIGANS CAUSING TROUBLE THE ALCOHOL BAN THE MAIN FRONT PAGE STORY IN THE SUN THEY THINK IT'S ALL SOBER
IT IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN IN MAY OF COURSE YOU'RE AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME A GOOD DEAL OF YOUR MORE BILLY EVEN TEMBER AND RACKED UP YOUR PHONE BILL AT THE SAME TIME WAITING TO TALK TO THE TAX MAN OR TANKS WOMAN TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE PAYING THE RIGHT AMOUNT IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE COST THE COUNTRY
ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IN WASTED TIME AND EXPENSIVE CALL CHARGES THAT IS THE VERDICT OF THE SPENDING WATCHDOG THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE WITH US IN THE STUDIO RUTH OWEN OF M. SEE THE REVENUE OF COURSE SHE IS DIRECTOR GENERAL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE MORNING TO YOU MORNING TIME FOR APOLOGY
WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY APOLOGISE BUT I'M HAPPY TO REPEAT THAT WE RECOGNISE THAT LAST YEAR WE WEREN'T OFFERING THE LEVEL OF SERVICES THAT WE EXPECT TO DELIVER TO OUR CUSTOMERS DURING THE EARLY PART OF FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE DID APOLOGISE THEN I WAS ON YOUR PROGRAMME THEN WE HAVE RECOVERED WE HAVE GOT OUR SERVICES BACK TO GOOD LEVELS OF SERVICE OUT OF THAT THE SLIGHTLY BAFFLING THING IN THIS REPORT IS THE AVERAGE CALL WAITING TIMES TRIPLED BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST
YOU SACKED START OFF BEFORE THE ALTERNATIVE TO PHONE LIGHTS THE DIGITAL SERVICE WAS REALLY PROPPING UP AND RUNNING WHY
WELL THE TRUTH OF IT IS IS THAT HOW WE BROUGHT IN THE CHANGES IN NOT JUST THE DIGITAL SERVICES BUT ANNIE TELEPHONY IN PARTICULAR SO WE PHASED IN NEW TECHNOLOGY AND WE GOT CAUGHT BY UNEXPECTED INCREASES IN THE LENGTH OF OUR CALLS AND WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH A MILLION CALLS A WEEK
EVEN CALLS GOING UP BY ONE MINUTE EACH EXTEND THE LENGTH OF EACH CALL SO WE RECOGNISE WE COULD PHASE THAT IN DIFFERENTLY AND THAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE THAT OBVIOUSLY UNFORTUNATELY SOME TAXPAYERS EXPERIENCED IN WAITING TIMES THE THING THAT BOTHERS PEOPLE LIT BOLLO'S M.P.S ON THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE IS BOTHERED THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE IS THE FACT THERE WERE WARNINGS SO BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE
THERE WAS A REPORT FROM M.P.S THAT SAID THE PROSPECTS ARE FEWER STAFF ARE MORE CALLS ARE A REAL RISK TO H.M.R.C. BEING ABLE TO IMPROVE STANDARDS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE PAST CUSTOMER SERVICES SUFFERED WHEN WORK MOST INCREASED THERE'S A SLIGHT SENSE HERE THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN FORESEEN AND IT SIMPLY WASN'T
I THINK WE PLAN FOR WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE KEY POINT IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WHAT THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE IS POINTING OUT AND WHAT WE HAVE APOLOGISE FOR IS THAT DURING A SHORT PERIOD IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THINGS DIPPED AND ACTUALLY WHAT WE'VE DONE IS TO RECTIFY THAT SORT THAT OUT AND THERE WE ARE BACK TO GOOD LEVELS OF SERVICE AND YOU EXPECT FOR THE NEXT YEAH
THERE WILL NOT BE THIS SORT OF REPORT NOT THIS SORT OF CRITICISM OR IS IT TOO EARLY TO GUARANTEE THAT NO I'D LIKE TO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL NOT ONLY MAINTAIN THE GOOD LEVELS OF SERVICE THAT WE'RE OFFERING AT THE MOMENT BUT WE WILL GET EVEN BETTER AND YOU MIGHT EVEN GET SOME MONEY BACK IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE FOR A LONG TIME WELL ACTUALLY DESPITE WHAT THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS WE ARE ON OH THREE HUNDRED NUMBERS NOW FOR MOST PEOPLE IT IS FREE TO CALL HATE MARCIE
SO IT'S FREE TO DO THAT IT'S NOT FREE TO GIVE UP A LOT OF TIME WAITING FOR THE ANSWER REFERRING H.M.R.C. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LOOK AT THAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT NOW DAVID CAMERON HAS TAKEN HIS CAMPAIGN TO KEEP THE U.K. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION TO THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT IN JAPAN THE PRIME MINISTER'S HOME TO RECRUIT SOME MORE FOREIGN LEADERS
TO HIS CAUSE THERE BUT IF HE'S LOOKING FOR AN INFLUENTIAL FOREIGNER PERHAPS HE SHOULD'VE STAYED AT WESTMINSTER IS A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRENT EXPECTS IT'S HARDLY A SURPRISE TO DISCOVER THAT THE CHAIR OF THE TREASURY COMMITTEE STARTS THE DAY WITH THE FINANCIAL TIMES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU
THIS MORNING OVER YOUR BREAKFAST PORRIDGE OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE
THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. ANDREW TYREE WAS TALKING TO MARK CARNEY THE CANADIAN GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND WHERE IT SAYS
IN BRITISH GOVERNMENT CIRCLES OR AS AN UNOFFICIAL PANTHEON OF FOREIGNERS CONSIDER BEST PLACED TO SHAPE PUBLIC OPINION
MARK CARNEY APPEARS TO CARRY THE MOST CLAPPED OUT IT'S NOT JUST MINISTERS AND MANDARINS WHO HANG ON DOCTOR CARNEY'S EVERY WORD RECENT POLL TO YOUR VIEWS TO BE
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE OF THE QUEEN
ANGELA MERKEL AND DOLLY AS IMPORTANT AS THOSE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
THE GOVERNOR SOUNDED FLATTERED THANK YOU I TAKE IT YOU WON'T BE CALLING THE OTHER PEOPLE ON
THE KING OF THE COMMITTEE CORRIDOR WHEN IT COMES TO BOOKING CELEBRITY WITNESSES IS THE LABOUR CHAIR OF THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE KEITH AS WHO HAS A TRACK RECORD THE PRODUCERS OF MOST CHAT SHOWS WOULD ENVY BUT WAS ANDREW TYREE ABOUT TO UP THE STAKES
IT'S NOT ON THE LIST BUT I I WOULDN'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POSSIBILITY OF CHRISTINE THE GUARD DRIFTING
WHEN SHE COMES IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME IF SHE DOES DECIDE TO PUT BOTH FEET
CHRISTINE LA GARDE IS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND EARLIER THIS MONTH SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING POSITIVE ABOUT THE U.K. VOTING TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION A COMMENT ECHOED THOSE OF MARK CARNEY WHO GAVE A WARNING THAT A VOTE TO LEAVE COULD POSSIBLY LEAD TO A RECESSION
LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS WERE FURIOUS AND A CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF THE TREASURY COMMITTEE JACOB REES MOGG CALLED ON THE GOVERNOR TO RESIGN
ON MONDAY A TREASURY REPORT PREDICTED THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS COULD BE LOST IF THE U.K. LEFT THE E.U. THE PRIME MINISTER SAID IT SHOWED A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD BE A D.I.Y. RECESSION
MARK CARNEY TOLD THE M.P.S THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAD SHOWN HIM A DRAFT COPY OF THE REPORT OVER BREAKFAST A FORTNIGHT AGO
NOT THE SORT OF REVELATION TO REASSURE JACOB REES MOGG WHO QUESTION THE GOVERNOR AT LENGTH ABOUT WHY THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAD EXPRESSED AN OPINION ABOUT THE REFERENDUM WHEN IT WOULDN'T GET INVOLVED IN AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN
IT'S VERY CONVENIENT THAT YOU'RE GIVING OUT EXACTLY SAME PROBLEM

DOCTOR CARNEY ADDED THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE STRAIGHT WITH PEOPLE DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE ABLE
WE HURRY AS SOON AS YOU CONFIDENCE FOR YOU BOB

YOU HAVE A FRIEND WE HAVE ME AND BY ACCIDENT BY A COMMENTARY WHICH MAY BE INCONVENIENT FOR YOU
MAYBE IN COMMUNITY BUT FIRE ACTIONS COMMENT WE HAD MADE IT MORE LIKELY THAT WE WILL BE INFLATION BACK TO TARGET WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM SOONER AND MORE SUSTAINABLY AND THAT WILL BE A BETTER IT THAT'S OUR CONTRIBUTION TO BETTER ECONOMIC I'LL COME FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
IS TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THAT I DO STRESS WAS TRYING ON YOUR MIND
JACOB REES MOGG COMPLAINED THAT THE BANK HAD BECOME POLITICALLY INVOLVED AND APPEARED TO BE A CREATURE OF THE GOVERNMENT ANDREW TYREE WAS MORE SYMPATHETIC I CAN SAY
THE VIEW OF A LARGE NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE
IS THAT A VALVE ALL THAT
BANK OF ENGLAND ON THIS SUBJECT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN ME
BUMPY

SEAN CURRAN REPORTING MORE OF CALLS FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT ON ONE NINE EIGHT LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL
TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN AMEN HEADLINE THIS MORNING'S THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES SAYS LEAVING THE E.U. COULD FORCE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO PROLONG AUSTERITY MEASURES FOR A FURTHER TWO YEARS WATCH OUT THERE'S A ROBOT ABOUT TO TAKE YOUR AND WHO KNOWS PERHAPS MINE AND JUSTIN'S JOB TWO THERE HAVE BEEN REPEATED WARNINGS THAT TECHNOLOGY COULD SOON RESULT IN MASS JOB LOSSES ACROSS THE WORLD'S ECONOMY BUT AT THE ENO ROBO
EXHIBITION IN PARIS THIS WEEK THE FOCUS IS ON SO CALLED ROBOTS APPARENTLY ALTOGETHER LESS THREATENING A MAN HE CAN TELL US MORE THAN MANAGE THERE IN PARIS OR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT RORY CAREFUL AND JONES WHAT PRAY RORY IS A CLUE BOT
WELL NICK WE'VE GOT USED TO BIG ROBOTS IN FACTORIES DOING ALL AUTOMATED TASKS VERY DANGEROUS THINGS HIDDEN BEHIND CAGE IS DOING ONE THING CO BOTS ARE COLLABORATIVE ROBOTS ARE COMING OUT FROM BEHIND THE CAGE IS DOING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TASKS ALONGSIDE WORKERS THE FRIENDLY FACE OF ROBOTS AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN STRESSING AT THE SHOW THIS YEAR THIS SHOW AND I ASKED KATERINA THE PRESIDENT HAVE BEEN A ROBO WHAT WAS EXCITING AT THIS YEAR
A BIG TRANCES COLLABORATIVE RUB ATTIC IN THE INDUSTRY BUT WORKING ALONGSIDE THE WORKER TO EASE IS
THE SECOND EXCITING TREND THAT LISA'S A PROFESSIONAL SERVICE RUBBER TIGS SAID HE'S BEING DEPLOYED NOW IN YOUR STORE IN YOUR C.T.S IN YOUR STREET SO AS A DIPPING BOUNTY SCAMMING AND IT'S FAR BETTER WORLD SO WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT THOSE PREDICTIONS ARE MASS UNEMPLOYMENT ON THE HORIZON
WELL OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE TRYING TO PLAY THEM DOWN I'VE GOT TO TRAIN A ROBOT A ROBOT CALLED SOYA TO DO A SIMPLE TASK AND I TALKED TO THE MAN HE WAS SHOWING OFF HER ANKLES YOUR OWN LE PLUS GENERATION ROBOTS AND HE INSISTED TO ME THAT ROBOTS WON'T NECESSARILY LEAD TO MASSIVE JOB CUTS
ROBERT IS SAFE THAT'S TO SAY YOU WERE OBLIGED TO PUT A FENCE BETWEEN A HUMAN AND ROBOT FOR YOU ARE ABLE TO PROG RUN THERE ARE BUT BY USING THE MOVEMENT OF THE ARM ITSELF I KNOW THESE GOING TO TAKE AS MANY JOBS AWAY FRANKLY TRADITIONAL ROBOTS HAVE IN FACTORIES AND THE TRIBE THAT BECAUSE TRADITIONAL ROBOTS PUT THE FENCE AND SO DURER GRAPHICALLY DID MOVE AWAY PEOPLE FROM THE TUSKS
THIS ROBOT'S A LAUNCH ROUGH PEOPLE AND ROBOTS IN THE SAME PLACE I'M NOT SURE THAT'S ROBERT WE'VE REPLACED BEFORE WE CREATED NEW WHITTAKER JOBS YOU WILL HAVE A TEAM OF ROBOTS M. PEOPLE
REASSURANCE THERE RORY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED RORY AND JANE'S JOINING US FROM PARIS THE TIME TEN TO SEVEN THE AFGHAN TALIBAN HAVE A NEW LEADER SAINT DRUMMER JUMBA IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN KABUL THE AFGHAN CAPITAL WHO IS IT SANDRA
WELL JUSTIN HE'S HYPER TO LURK AND SADA HE'S INFLUENTIAL RELIGIOUS CLERIC HE WAS DEPUTY TO THEIR PREVIOUS LEADER WILL OF COURSE KILLED LAST WEEKEND IN A DRONE ATTACK AN AMERICAN DRONE ATTACK INSIDE PAKISTAN IN THE PROVINCE OF BELOW DONE IT'S AN INTERESTING CHOICE BECAUSE HE IS MORE OF A RELIGIOUS LEADER THAN A MILITARY COMMANDER WHICH MEANS HE'S LIKELY TO HAVE THE MORAL AUTHORITY ACROSS THE TALIBAN RANK AND FILE HE'S FROM KANDAHAR WHICH IS THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE
INSIDE KABUL WHICH THE FOUNDER OF THE TALIBAN WILL I BELONG TO SO HE HE HAS THE MORAL HEFT IF YOU LIKE TO GIVE THE TALIBAN LEADERSHIP MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT DESPERATELY NEEDS MULLER MANSELL'S KILLING WAS A MASSIVE SET BACK AND LEADERSHIP IN WHAT DIRECTION I'M A DIZZY WANT A FIGHTER DOES HE WANT AT ALL
I THINK THE FACT THAT HE IS A RELIGIOUS LEADER IS AN INDICATION THAT THE TALIBAN WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE THAT THEY'RE OPEN TO PEACE TALKS IT'S ALSO INTERESTING BECAUSE ONE OF THE CONTENDERS FOR THE LEADERSHIP IS HAS BEEN NAMED AS DEPUTY SIR ROGER THAN HER CONNIE WHO'S AN AGGRESSIVE MILITARY COMMANDER HE'S BELIEVED TO BE BEHIND SOME OF THE
MORE BLAH SOME MASSIVE BOMB ATTACKS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN AND AROUND KABUL OVER THE PAST MANY YEARS IF HE WAS MADE THE LEADER HE WAS A CONTENDER IT WOULD HAVE VERY MUST SIGNALLED A MOVE AWAY FROM THE PEACE TABLE SO THERE IS SOME INDICATION PERHAPS THAT MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE IN THAT DIRECTION SO WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVE DO YOU THINK FROM THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT SPORS PERSPECTIVE WHAT WHAT HOW WILL THEY REACT TO THIS
IT'S A IT'S AN INTERESTING SITUATION THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY WERE VERY PLEASED THAT THE AMERICANS TOOK THE ATTACK ACROSS INTO PAKISTAN WHERE THE TALIBAN FOR YEARS HAS HAD A SAFE HAVEN THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE IN THE LURCH STAND WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN TARGETED BEFORE SO YOU KNOW THE FACT IS THAT THIS WAS A MILITARY STRIKE WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT IS AN OPTION THAT
AT THE AMERICANS AND THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WANT TO FOLLOW THEY WERE OF COURSE HOPE THAT THIS WILL IN SOME WAY SQUEEZE A TALIBAN LEADERSHIP AND DRAW THEM BACK TO THE PEACE TABLE BUT REALLY IT'S IT'S UNLIKELY TO PAY IMMEDIATE EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE MORE VIOLENCE THAT'S THE SENSE I'M GETTING FROM THE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO ON THE GROUND SOME KIND OF ANGER AND RETRIBUTION FOR THE KILLING
OF THE LEADER IN THE MANNER IN WHICH HE WAS HE WAS TAKEN OUT SO WE'RE NOT LIKELY TO SEE MUCH MOVEMENT TO WORDS A PEACE SETTLEMENT ANY TIME SOON TIME DRUMMER JUMPER IN KABUL THANKS SO MUCH IT IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW THE BIDDERS HAVE MADE THEIR PITCH THE FUTURE STILL MAKING UP AT ALL BUT IS DEPENDENT NOW ON THE FATE OF THOSE BIDS THEIR STRENGTH THEIR VIABILITY THERE ARE SEVEN INTERESTED BIDDERS
WE ARE TOLD A FOUR OF THEM SEEM TO BE SERIOUSLY UNDER CONSIDERATION AT THE BOARD MEETING OF TARTAR WHICH TAKES PLACE IN MUMBAI TODAY PATATA OF COURSE TATA STEEL IS THE INTER COMPANY THAT WANTS TO SELL AT THE TALBOT PLANT LET'S TALK TO TOM CROSS WHO IS A DIRECTOR OF ANY US ANY ASSES THE U.K.'S SECOND BIGGEST MANUFACTURING COMPANY
EMPLOYS FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR THIS DEBATE THERE IS ALSO AN ENERGY INTENSIVE USER AND KNOWS ABOUT THE INS AND OUTS OF BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON ENERGY TOM QUITE A GOOD MORNING TO YOU AND JUST WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WELL I SUPPOSE THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE STRENGTHS THAT A FOR SUCCESSFUL BIDDER ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SHOW IN ORDER TO GET
I THINK THE KEY IF YOU LOOK AT OUR HISTORY IN TAKING ON BIG COMMODITY BUSINESSES YOU HAVE TO BASICALLY UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CYCLE AND THESE VERY SICKLE BUSINESSES YOU CAN MAKE CASH
SO YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN GET A COT SPACE THAT'S GOING TO WORK LONG TERM THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE AND THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO GET EVERYTHING RIGHT YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR ENERGY COS RIGHT HAVE TO GET THE LABOUR COSTS RIGHT YOU HAVE TO GET THE SKILL LEVELS RIGHT IF THEY CAN DO ALL THAT THEN THEY CAN MAKE MONEY WHEN IT COMES INTO A PLAN FOR EMPLOYMENT AND CONTINUING EMPLOYMENT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SAY ABOUT THE NUMBERS
I THINK I MEAN STILL IS RELATIVELY COMPARED TO CHEMICALS WHICH IS OUR BUSINESS STILL EMPLOYS MORE PEOPLE PER PER UNIT ABOUT PUT THE KEY IS THEY HAVE TO BELIEVE A VERY SKILLED WORKFORCE I THINK THEY DO AND THAT'S ONE A GREAT BENEFITS UCOS GOT HAS GOT A SKILLED WORKFORCE IN THIS AREA THEY COME THEY GO INTO THIS SAYING AND WE WILL KEEP ALL OF THOSE SKILLS I VERY MUCH DOUBT IT
I DON'T THINK ANY COMPANY WOULD WANT TO MAKE THAT LEVEL OF COMMITMENT BECAUSE AS I SAID IT COMES BACK TO COSTS THEY HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE COST OF PRODUCTION IS GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THEN POTENTIALLY IT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE PROPORTION OF THE PEOPLE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED FOR TATA STEEL IMP AT ALL BUT WHO WOULD HAVE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS FOR A BIT TO BE TRULY VIABLE
I I COULDN'T MAKE A GUESS ADDICTS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS WELL ENOUGH BUT TYPICALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUSINESSES THAT WE'VE RUN WE HAVE REDUCED OVER TIME NOT THROUGH MAKING MASSIVE COMPULSORY DANCES WE PRODUCE COS BY SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MOST BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE TAKEN ON THAT WOULD BE A TYPICAL POSITION BUT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OR TOO MUCH FOR THEM BUT THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD HAVE LOOKED UP FOR A BIT
THE OTHER QUESTION I SUPPOSE IS THERE THE WIDER ONE OF THE SKILLS AND YOU SAY YOU THINK THE SKILLS ARE FOR ACTUALLY THERE AT THE MOMENT TO DO IN TERMS OF THE DIRECTION THAT THE BUSINESS GOES IN WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDER SHOULD BE SHOWING IN TERMS OF AMBITION UP AT ALL BUT FOR WHAT IT CAN DO I THINK MY SKILLS ARE THERE BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO COMPETE ON THE WORLD MARKET GOING FORWARD AND IF WE LOOK AT OUR SITUATION WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR WE FOUND THAT
A LOT OF THE SKILLS IN THE U.K. PARTICULARLY THE HIGH LEVEL AT GRADUATE LEVEL SKILLS ARE TO ACADEMIC IN THIS COUNTRY WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY INVESTING IN WHAT WE CALL VOCATIONAL SKILLS MORE APPRENTICESHIPS MORE CROSSOVERS BETWEEN DEGREES AND APPRENTICESHIPS TO GIVE YOU THE SORTS OF SKILLS YOU NEED TO RUN A BIG MANUFACTURE COUPLE THAT'S WHAT THE GERMANS DO SUCH AS THIS IS A PEOPLE TALK ENDLESSLY ABOUT SKILL SHORTAGE RIGHT ACROSS INDUSTRY BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT ACTUALLY PART OF THE SOLUTION TO IT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE
BY THE COMPANY THAT TAKES OVER AND PUT ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THERE'S NO QUESTION IT WAS ONE OF THE BIG LEARNING'S WE HAD WHEN WE TOOK OVER LETS AIR GRANGEMOUTH OPERATIONS UP IN SCOTLAND WE PUT ONE OF OUR GERMAN GUYS IN CHARGE HAVE BEEN RUNNING AT THE BIG GERMAN OPERATIONS FOR US AT ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DID WAS CHANGE THE WAY THEY TRAIN THEIR ENGINEERS TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE WAY THEY DO IN GERMANY WHICH IS A MUCH MORE MIXED ECONOMY OF ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL SKILLS SO YES I THINK THEY CAN MAKE THOSE CHANGES TOM GROTTY DIRECTOR OF ANY US THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU

EXPANDED DIGITAL SERVICES REVENUE AND CUSTOMS SAID IT HAD NOW FULLY RECOVERED AND SERVICE LEVELS WERE BETTER THAN THEY'D BEEN FOR YEARS

SEA HAS ANALYSE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO HOMES THEY'VE GOT THE LOWEST RATING
WHEN INSPECTORS WENT BACK THEY FOUND SEVENTY THREE PER CENT OF THEM HAD MADE SOME IMPROVEMENT OF THE REMAINING NINETY NINE HOMES WERE STILL INADEQUATE THE WATCHDOG SAYS THIS SHOWS TOUGHER INSPECTIONS ARE PUSHING UP STANDARDS THE FINDINGS ARE WELCOMED BY CARE HOMEOWNERS BUT THEY WARNED THE SQUEEZE ON FEES FROM COUNCILS MEANS THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE FOR MANY OF THEM IS TO SURVIVE
THERE'S BEEN A SHARP DROP IN THE AMOUNT OF ANTIBIOTICS PRESCRIBED BY G.P.S IN ENGLAND N.H.S. FIGURES SHOW THAT IN THE PAST YEAR THERE WERE TWO POINT SIX MILLION FEWER PRESCRIPTIONS THAN IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS A REDUCTION OF MORE THAN SEVEN PER CENT
UNIVERSITY LECTURERS RESEARCHERS AND LIBRARIANS ARE BEGINNING A FORTY EIGHT HOUR STRIKE TODAY OVERPAY MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE UNION SAY THE OFFER OF A RISE OF JUST OVER ONE PER CENT IS AN INSULT HERE'S OUR EDUCATION REPORTER JUDITH BURNS

THE UNION POINTS OUT LECTURERS HAVE HEARD OF FOURTEEN PER CENT REAL TERMS PAY CUT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE STAFF ARE ALSO REFUSING OVERTIME AND FURTHER ACTION OVER THE SUMMER COULD HIT OPEN DAYS GRADUATION CEREMONIES AND CLEARING

THANK YOU IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THIS TUBE FISCAL STUDIES CLAIMS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT BODY IT LOOKS AT THE FIGURES IT MAKES CAREFUL DISPASSIONATE JUDGEMENTS ITS VERDICT ON EUROPE IS THIS ON THE ONE HAND WE GIVE THE EUROPEAN UNION EIGHT BILLION POUNDS A YEAR THAT'S THE FIGURE THAN ACTUALLY GETS TRANSFERRED FROM MASTER BRUSSEL AND DOESN'T COME BACK
YOU COULD HAVE THAT MONEY AND WE COULD SPEND IT AS WE SEE FIT IF WE WERE TO LEAVE ON THE OTHER HAND IF LEAVING THE E.U. REDUCE NATIONAL INCOME BADGER'S NOT POINT SIX PERCENT WE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT MONEY ALL THE BENEFITS OF IT WOULD BE OUTWEIGHED BY THE COSTS COME A LLAMA ECONOMICS EDITOR HIS HAIR AND THEIR POINT THEN COME OFF FOLLOWING ON FROM THAT IS THAT
THAT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE THE CASE IS IT THAT A NATIONAL INCOME WOULD GO DOWN THE WOOD WHITE
THAT'S THE JUDGEMENT THEY ARE MAKING YES AS YOU SAY JUST IN THEY GIVE THE U.K. GOVERNMENT AND IMMEDIATE GAIN IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION OF THE EIGHT BILLION POUNDS THAT'S I'M NET CONTRIBUTION TO THAT WE MAKE ANNUALLY TO THE E.U. IT THEN LOOKS AT ALL THE MODELLING THAT HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT COULD BE OF BRITAIN LEAVING AND THEY GO FROM THE VERY PESSIMISTIC SOCIETY JENNA ALL THE FRENCH BANKS SAID
MINUS SIX PER CENT ON NATIONAL INCOME OUR G.D.P. RELATIVE TO REMAIN SCENARIO THE TREASURY OF COURSE EARLIER THIS WEEK SAID A SIMILAR VERY BAD IMPACT IN THAT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH TO
MORE OPTIMISTIC VIEWS A GROUP CALLED ECONOMIST FOR BRECHT'S IS SAY ACTUALLY THAT THE ECONOMY WOULD BE BOOSTED BY LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION AS IT WAS WHEN BRITAIN LEFT THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM THE FORERUNNER TO THE SINGLE CURRENCY
THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES THEN SAYS IT TAKES THE MIDLINE OF ALL THOSE ESTIMATES AND SAYS THAT IT WOULD BE REASONABLE GIVEN ALL THE ECONOMIC MODELLING TO SUGGEST THAT THE U.K. ECONOMY WOULD BE NEGATIVELY HIT BY ABOUT TWO TO THREE PER CENT
SO THERE'LL BE TWO TO THREE PER CENT SMALLER IN THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR YEARS THAT IT WOULD BE UNDER A RIM AND DAY REMAIN SCENARIO THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON OUR G.D.P. THAT WOULD REDUCE
TAX RECEIPTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND ROUGHLY FOR EVERY ONE PER CENT FAWNING G.D.P. IT RAISES IT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NEED TO RAISE A FRESH FOURTEEN BILLION POUNDS THERE'S A BIG BUT THERE ISN'T THIS IS A META ANALYSIS IS ANALYSIS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FIGURES AND GONE THEIR OWN WORK THEY'RE NOT COMING UP WITH ANYTHING NEW THIS MORNING A LOT OF THESE FIGURES THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT MIGHT BE WRONG MIGHT BE THEMSELVES POLITICALLY PREJUDICED ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET US ANYWHERE
I THINK IT DOES I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT ECONOMIC MODELS AREN'T POLITICAL PER SE AND I THINK HE WOULD BE STRETCHING THAT'S WHAT LIQUID INTO THESE SO DOESN'T IT IT DOES IT WOULD IT DEPENDS IT WOULD STRETCH I THINK
LOGIC TO SUGGEST THAT ALL THESE ORGANISATIONS THAT HAVE FOUND OR BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ECONOMICALLY IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WERE ALL DOING IT BECAUSE OF POLITICS WHETHER THAT WAS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH BEAN STEW FISCAL STUDIES ITSELF THE O.E.C.D.
A NUMBER OF BANKS A NUMBER AND INVESTMENT HOUSES IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY THEY ALL MUST BE WRONG NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ARE NOT DISPUTED FACT SIR YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S INTERESTING YESTERDAY RICHARD SHARPE A MEMBER OF THE FINANCIAL POLICY COMMITTEE WHICH IS THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S FINANCIAL STABILITY COMMITTEE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T REALLY AGREE WITH THE
BANK OF ENGLAND'S ARGUMENT THAT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INTO THE U.K. WOULD BE HUGELY AFFECTED BY BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION HE SAID THE BRITAIN WOULD STILL BE A VERY INVESTABLE
ECONOMY I THINK THAT WE NEED TO SLIGHTLY STEP BACK FROM THIS IDEA THAT BECAUSE IT'S DISPUTED THEREFORE THE FIGURES ON BOTH SIDES ARE WHAT A BIT RUBBISH THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE ALL ECONOMIC MODELS THEY ARE LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT
THE WEIGHT OF ECONOMIC OPINION TO AN EXTENT SAYS THAT IF WE WERE TO LEAVE HE WOULD BE MORE NEGATIVE THAN POSITIVE BUT THERE ARE PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE ARGUMENTS THAT
IF WE LEFT IT MIGHT BE A SHORT TERM SHOCK BUT THE RESPONSE IN THE U.K. ECONOMY OVER THE LONGER TERM COULD BE PRETTY ROBUST COME ON I'M HER THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WERE TALKING TO JOHN REDWOOD LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME AND TO ALISTAIR DARLING
IT IS NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES AFTER SEVEN AT TWO O'CLOCK THIS MORNING AFTER ELEVEN HOURS OF NEGOTIATIONS A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH WAS HAILED IN BRUSSELS THE GREEK GOVERNMENT REACHED A DEAL WITH ITS CREDITORS INCLUDING THE I.M.F.

WITH A WIN IN THE WASHINGTON STATE PRIMARY MIGHT BE PUZZLED THING THERE WAS NO RACE LEFT TO BE RUG THE OTHER CANDIDATES LEFT THEIR NAMES ON THE BALLOT PAPER ALTHOUGH THEY'VE OFFICIALLY WITHDRAWN IT MISTER TRUMP IS TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE OF COURSE IT WILL BE PROBABLY BECAUSE WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT ONE ISSUE IMMIGRATION HE'S PROMISED TO BUILD THAT'S WARMER COST THE U.S. SOUTHERN BORDER WITH MEXICO HE SPOKEN OF SENDING THE ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE
THOUGHT TO BE IN THE U.S. ILLEGALLY BACK TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES THE ISSUE IS FAR FROM NEW BUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS GALVANISED THE ANGER SURROUNDING IT A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT JIM NON CTTEE REPORTS NOW FROM SOUTHERN GALLOP
IN THE MAELSTROM OF ANGER THAT SURROUNDS AND SUPPORTS THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN YOU CAN HEAR IT HERE AT A RALLY IN TO MACULA CALIFORNIA
THAT IS ONE CONSISTENT THEME THAT HE'S TURNED INTO A RALLYING CRY
I BROUGHT UP FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT ANYONE'S HEARD OF PRACTICALLY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
TURKEY AND THEN THEY FIND OUT I'M RIGHT AND THEN EVERYBODY COMES AND I SAID WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL AND EVERYBODY SIR ALL THAT'S CRAZY THAT'S CRAZY WE WERE
THE UNITED STATES MAY BE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS BUT OLD FEARS HAVE BEEN REKINDLED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PAINTS A PICTURE OF POROUS BORDERS AND A FLOOD OF MIGRANTS IN UNTOLD NUMBERS
SO I WENT TO THE MEXICAN BORDER WHERE HE SAYS AS PRESIDENT HE BUILD A WALL AS LONG AND AS HIGH AS NECESSARY
CEILINGS DOWN HERE DO YOU SEE MIGRANT CAMPS DOWN HERE OR PEOPLE TO BE DEPORTED ON THE SOUTH SIDE BUT THE MIXING OF US FINALLY GOT AROUND TO REMOVING THEM THEY USED TO LIVE DOWN
I'M ON THE DRIED UP THEY'D HAVE THEY TO ONE A RIVER LOOKING AT THE GRAVE METAL FENCE THAT SEPARATES THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO
IN FRONT TO ME IT'S A BIT OF GRASSY SCRUBLAND IS NO MAN'S LAND WHERE PEOPLE TRY TO CROSS FROM MEXICO EVERY DAY THIS IS THE BORDER THAT HAS BECOME THE FRONT LINE IN AMERICAN POLITICS
WITH CHRIS HARRIS AND AGENT ON THIS BORDER FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE IN THE SAN DIEGO SECTOR HERE FOR THE NATIONAL BORDER PATROL CANCEL
THEY STILL COME FROM HERE ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT WE'VE HAD THEM DRIVE THROUGH IN VEHICLES COME TO ON BICYCLES OR ONE THREE GROUPS ARE TOO HIDE

THEY'RE GOING TO BE SET OFF THE RELEASE BY ANOTHER IN SEA ICE WILL BE HELL BUT THEN RELEASED SO WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED
WHEN YOU SAY THE PEOPLE CLAIM CREDIBLE FEAR THIS IS THE THE ALLOWANCES MADE FOR PEOPLE WHO SAY LOOK IF I IF I GO BACK TO WHERE I CAME FROM I'M GOING TO FACE A THREAT IT'S RATHER LIKE CLAIMING ASYLUM WHERE DO YOU GET THESE CLAIMS OF CREDIBLE FEAR COMING FROM AROUND THE WORLD ON THIS BIT OF THE MEXICAN BORDER WE DIDN'T ORDER A CHINESE WE DID A LOT OF WRONG
WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM INDIA PAKISTAN AFGHANISTAN BANGLADESH NE PAS
BHUTAN MILDLY SENEGAL I RAN AND I RAN ACTS

COURSE AS TIME REALISED FUCK THE SIN MORE ALIKE THAN EITHER REALLY GONE THE GROSS FOR YOU NOW BECAME THE FIDO HALL HE WAS SO WAS I WASN'T
TAKE MY PHOTO TO HEAR WHY WE TOOK THEM OFF AND TAKE THAT GETS TO THE HEART OF A QUESTION THAT'S BEEN SENSITIVE IN AMERICA FOR DECADES
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ILLEGALLY AND IN SOME CASES HAVE BEEN IN THE U.S. FOR MANY YEARS HAVE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WHO ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THE WORKFORCE MANY LEADING REPUBLICANS LIKE SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN WHO KNOWS THE PROBLEM WELL IN ARIZONA
SO THAT YOU SIMPLY CAN'T DEPORT THEM THE LOWEST FIGURE FOR A SO CALLED UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IS ELEVEN MILLION YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM WHAT HE CALLED A PASS TO CITIZENSHIP
ONE OF THE DOZEN OR SO INTO SECTIONS IN SAN DIEGO WHERE AS IN SO MANY OTHER CITIES NEAR THE BORDER EVERY MORNING WORKERS GATHER OFFERED THEMSELVES ON THE STREET AS DAY LABOURERS
SOME OF THEM SAY THEY ARE IN AMERICA LEGALLY
OTHERS DISAPPEAR QUICKLY AS WE APPROACH MAYBE ONE DAY YOU WILL GET AWAY

AT THE GUARD FOR THE GOLDEN STATE CALIFORNIANS WILL SELECT A NEW SENATOR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY FOUR YEARS
IN THE U.S. SENATE RACE IN CALIFORNIA THE DEMOCRAT CONTENDERS TO CHARACTERISE THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE AS A CONTEST BETWEEN FEAR AND JUSTICE
ONE OF THEM THE ORANGE COUNTY CONGRESSWOMAN LAURETTA SANCHEZ SPOKE TO US AFTER THE CANDIDATES HAD A TELEVISED DEBATE
THE WHOLE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS QUITE FRANKLY BROKE IT IN THE UNITES FIT AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO SIT DOWN AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THERE'S A DEBT DRESSES THE DIFFERENT ISSUES
THOSE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE HERE IN THOSE PEOPLE WHOSE SHIRT BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE WE KNOW WHO'S COMING IN WHO WAS GOING OUT AND THEN PARTLY WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE WORKERS FOR THE FUTURE OF AMERICA WE KNOW THAT WE SEE THE DEMOGRAPHICS WE ARE OLIVINE MINE BACK RULES FROM NINETEEN NINETY
SO WHAT'S TO BE DONE PETER NO NOTICES A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IN SAN DIEGO NOW CHAIRMAN OF THE THINK TANK THE CENTRE FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES AND HE ARGUES THAT THE REASON FOR THE POLITICAL HEAT ISN'T SCAREMONGERING IT'S ALL COME ABOUT BECAUSE IMMIGRATION IS CHAOTIC
AND HE'S BLUNT ABOUT THE FORCES THAT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS WANT TO ACCEPT HIS VIEW

MILAN REAL MADRID PARIS SAYS YOUR MAN AND OF COURSE OUR OWN CHELSEA ARGUABLY HE'S THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MANAGER IN FOOTBALL TODAY HIS NEW BOOK IT'S CALLED CARLO ANCELOTTI QUIET LEADERSHIP AND I ASKED HIM WHETHER THE CONSTANT THREAT OF THE SACK WAS JUST SOMETHING MODERN MANAGERS HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH

THIS IS THE WAY I THINK THAT WAS NOT THE EASY AFTER SORT OF FELT IT WAS A RELIEF TO BE MANAGER OF MANCHESTER AND I HAD BECAUSE
IN THE LAST USED THROW THEY LOST A FANTASTIC MANAGER ALEX FELT AS ONE OF THE LOST OR SOMEONE DOES PLAY UP YOUR FAIR HAVE SCORED SO I THOUGHT HE'D BE IN THE TEAM
I WAS NOT USED IT DOWN FALL FOR A GIRL AND THEY THINK AT THE END HE DID IT WILL JOB YOU WON THE F.A. CUP AND HOW WILL JOSE MARIE MARINO DEAR HE IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM YOU YOU FOLLOWED HIM AT CHELSEA HE'S A FIERY BIG NOISY PERSONALITY YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE QUIET MAN
I THINK EVERYONE HAS HIS OWN CHARACTER AS HIS OWN PERSONALITY THINKING EMBODYING IN MANCHESTER AND I DO THINK IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR MANCHESTER AND I DID AND BAKING AND WHAT IN YOUR WILL BE HAPPY TO BE THE MANAGER OF MANCHESTER UNITED IF YOU KNOW WHERE THE INK I THINK THAT WILL BE FINE REALLY GET SOME UNITED WORRY SHE PLAYS A DEFENSIVE KIND OF FOOTBALL
I DON'T THINK THIS IS REALLY VERY LITTLE THAT EVERY MANAGER AND MAUREEN YOU'RE STAYED IN CHARGE WHO WON WHO WENT TO HIM GOT HIM ON THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE YOU I'VE DONE MY BIT IF YOU WANDER ABOUT ON AND SO ON IS A WOMEN IS A WINNING MANAGER
YOU SAID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLUBS THERE ARE OTHER FAMILY CLUBS AND THE CLUBS THAT ARE MORE LIKE A BUSINESS
MY SENSES YOU PREFER THE FAMILY PURPLE THE EVERYONE BEFORE THE FARM HERE I PREFER TO WORK ON TO WORK IN A COMPANY OR NOT BUT I THINK THAT IS A DIFFERENT STYLE AND A LIVER AND EVEN WITH THE SUPERSTARS WHEN THEY'RE PAID MILLIONS OF POUNDS A YEAR
IS IT STILL POSSIBLE WHETHER REBEL THOUGH FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE THAT SORT OF RELATIONSHIP
I FOUND THE PLAYERS THEY CAN SAY JEAN THAT LAMP YOU BUT HE WAS I THINK THAT THE TOP LAYER OF OIL SURE
THE MOST PROFESSIONAL BUT AND SAW THAT FOR THE MANAGER THERE IS US BLAIR UP TO MANAGED CRISTIANO RONALDO'S USED TO REFER TO ALEX FERGUSON IS HIS FATHER IN FOOTBALL
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE THAT SORT OF RELATIONSHIP AS IF THESE YOUNG MEN LOOKED UP TO YOU AS A SORT OF I DON'T WANT TO BE A FATHER I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABOUT THAT WELL BUT I THOUGHT I COULD BE BACK AT HOME HOW DO I DO SAID I HAD TO TO TO TO BE A MANAGER FALLING FORWARD TO BECAUSE HE WAS A REALLY FANTASTIC UP PART OF THE FIVE THAT THE MORAL ASHIKA SCORED EVERY SINGLE GAME
GET ON THE OTHER EXPERT THESE A REALLY GOOD BIG TEMPLE FOR THE AD THAT BECAUSE HE'S REALLY PROFESSIONAL REALLY SAD HE WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD TO GO HOME I THINK HE'S THE IMAGE OF THEIR PLAYERS OUTSIDE THE TRAINING
BUT I THINK AT HOME AND I THINK HE'S THE BLARING INTO THEY'VE GOT US IN THE HOME IT'S BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY THE MONEY
THE GIRLS THE AGENTS THE PIA ALL OF THESE ARE A BARRIER BETWEEN A MANAGER NOW
AND THEIR PLAYERS THERE BUT THAT THE BLAIRS GAUZE INTO THE RESTING AT ALL WITH THE OTHER MAIDS THEY THE BLENDER GOES OUT TO THE BRIDGE BUT WITHERING EXCESS UNDER MANAGER LOOK AT THIS AND LEAVE LITTLE ENGLISH ES UN IS NOT WHAT THE BLUE
THEN HE'S GOING IT SEEMS TO ME THE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW QUITE HOW CARLO ANCELOTTI DOES IT THEY KNOW YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MANAGERS IN THE WORLD BUT THEY LOOK AT A FERGUSON AND THEY TALK OF THE HEAD

AND HIS PLAYERS THEY WERE A FAMILY UNITED JUST AS YOU WHAT I THINK THEY WERE A FAMILY I THINK
CARLO ON CHELSEA THEY'RE TALKING TO ME EARLIER
THIRTY MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IN THE SPEAKER AND A CARDIFF STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THAT HE DOES HAVE ITS HINDU TEACHER AND THEOLOGIAN GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THERE ARE NOW NEARLY AS MANY PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHO PROFESSED TO HAVING NO RELIGION AS THOSE THAT SAY THEY HAVE ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS BY STEPHEN BULLIVANT OF SAINT MARY'S CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY
AND HERE IN WALES THE SO CALLED NANS ARE IN THE MAJORITY BUT WHILST THIS REPORT SHEDS LIGHT ON RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION DOESN'T HELP DETERMINE A BRITAIN IS ANY LESS SPIRITUAL AND IT WAS THIS DEPENDS OF COURSE ON WHAT WE MEAN BY SPIRITUAL
MAYBE WERE MORE ENAMOURED THAN EVER OF CONSUMERISM TECHNOLOGY AND HAVING A GOOD TIME BUT I'D ARGUE THERE WERE ALSO MORE CONCERNED TO SEE A FAIR AND EQUAL SOCIETY TO EXTEND CARE AND COMPASSION TO ALL HUMANITY TO OTHER CREATURES ON OUR PLANET AND WHO DECIDED THAT WE CAN'T ENJOY LIFE WHILE STILL BEING SPIRITUAL
MOST OF THE FOLK I ME TOO CAN'T THEMSELVES AS NANS HAVE DEEP MORAL INSIGHTS AND BELIEFS THEY VALUE QUALITIES SUCH AS KINDNESS FREE WILL AND LOVE AS HAVING ULTIMATE MEANING
SOME DO FEEL THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN MATERIAL EXISTENCE AND EVEN SUSPECT THAT SOME ASPECT OF OUR BEING CONTINUES BEYOND DEATH MANY NUNS I KNOW SAY THEY DON'T IDENTIFY WITH ORGANISED RELIGION TO WHICH HINDUS OFTEN JOKE WELL THEN YOU'LL LIKE HINDUISM IT'S THE MOST DISORGANISED RELIGION AT LEAST ON ORGANISED IN THAT IT VALUES THE INDIVIDUALITY OF EACH PERSON SPIRITUAL POWER
OTHERS I HEAR EXPRESS PROBLEMS WITH PARTICULAR CONCEPT OR TRAILS OF GOD OR HIS PURPORTED MESSAGE AND OFTEN I AGREE I PROBABLY DON'T BELIEVE IN THE SPECIFIC IDEA OF GOD THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE HIM EITHER
ACCORDING TO THE HINDU THEY DOWN TO TEXT THERE'S NO CONFLICT BETWEEN RATIONALITY AND BELIEF IT'S THROUGH REASON AND LOGIC THAT HUMANITY CAN START TO CONTEMPLATE THE NATURE OF ULTIMATE REALITY AND FOR HINDUS BEING SPIRITUAL SHOULD ENTAIL A PHILOSOPHICAL COMPONENT DOING GOOD GIVING CHARITY ARE BEHAVING WELL ARE PART OF THE MORAL ACTIONS AND SELF DISCIPLINE KNOWN AS DARK
BUT THE TEXT WISHES TO GO FURTHER TO DEVELOP WHAT ARE CALLED AT MCGANN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOUL IS DIFFERENT TO THE PHYSICAL BODY AND PART OF A DIVINE REALITY
IT IS THIS PHILOSOPHICAL NOTION THAT WE ARE MORE THAN JUST PHYSICAL BEINGS THAT HINDU DETECTS CLAIM OPENS UP THE SACRED PATH ALLOWING THE INDIVIDUAL TO PROGRESS FOR MORAL BEHAVIOUR TO DEEP REALISATIONS OF THE NATURE OF SPIRITUAL EXISTENCE
ALTHOUGH HINDUISM CHAMPIONS THE PATH OF THE INDIVIDUAL IT NONETHELESS ENCOURAGES US TO DISCUSS SPIRITUAL ISSUES AND LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER
MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FROM SUCH CONVERSATION SUGGEST TO ME THAT BRITAIN IS NOT ONLY A FAR MORE MORAL SOCIETY THAN WE OFTEN CREDIT IT'S ALSO MORE SPIRITUAL HOWEVER YOU WISH TO DEFINE THAT
AND I'D SAY ALSO MORE OPEN TO EXPLORING WHAT WE MIGHT MEAN BY A MODERN PERHAPS EVEN UNIVERSAL SPIRITUALITY
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH A KINETIC DAS OR VISHNU PIN DO TEACHER AND THEOLOGIAN THE TIME NOW TEN TO EIGHT CAN IT REALLY BE THE CASE THAT ONE IN FIVE OF ALL THE CHILDREN BORN IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND TWO THOUSAND TEN HAVE ALREADY BEEN REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES BEFORE THEY REACHED THE AGE OF FIVE IT SEEMED LIKE A STAGGERINGLY HIGH FIGURE AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN
IN AWE BUT THAT'S WHAT RESEARCHERS ARE TELLING US AND PERHAPS PUTS INTO CONTEXT THE NEWS YESTERDAY THAT BIRMINGHAM CHILDREN'S SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN OFF THE CITY COUNCIL AND RUN BY A TRUST ONE OF THE REASONS THE SERVICE WAS UNACCEPTABLY POOR IN BIRMINGHAM WERE SAID TO BE THE MASSIVE CASELOAD ON INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL WORKERS THE CASELOAD THAT THEY WERE HAVING TO COPE WITH THIS TURN FIRST TO TODAY'S RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH BROUGHT OUT TODAY PROFESSOR ANDY BILSON IS ON THE LINE WHO IS ASSOCIATE DIRECTION
OF THE CENTRE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL LANCASHIRE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DID YOU DO TO COME UP WITH THAT FIGURE
WHAT I DID WAS TO ASK EVERY LOCAL AUTHORITY IN THE COUNTRY THROUGH A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST TO TELL ME HOW MANY CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN FINANCIAL YEAR HAVE BEEN REFERRED HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED HAD BEEN ASSESSED BEFORE THEY REACH THE AGE OF FIVE I GOT ANSWERS
FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THEY COVER OVER HALF A MILLION CHILDREN EIGHTY PER CENT OF ALL CHILDREN BORN IN THE FINDING THAT HIS IS PRETTY RIGOUROUS ACTUALLY SCIENTIFICALLY YOU'RE YOU'RE SATISFIED THAT THAT PICTURE IS THE RIGHT PICTURE FOR THE COUNTRY WRIT LARGE YES
WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY ISN'T IT IT'S CERTAINLY SHOCKED ME I'VE SEEN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH ENOUGH ACTUALLY DONE RESEARCH IN AUSTRALIA WHICH SHOWS A VERY HIGH LEVELS ON IT ON A SIMILAR BASIS BUT THIS IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE AUSTRALIAN AND THE AMERICAN STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE
AND IT'S NOT ALL THE MOST SERIOUS KIND OF ABUSE THAT'S BEEN REPORTED SOMETIMES AS JUST A REFERENCE ISN'T IT THERE GOES NOWHERE ELSE BUT NONETHELESS IT IT IS CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING REPORTED FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER TO TWO LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES YES SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE HAS THAT HAS HAD A CONCERN BUT THAT CONCERNED PROBABLY ISN'T ONE WHICH IS FOUNDED MANY OF THESE LEAD TO NOTHING AS YOU SAY AND IN ADDITION TO THAT
IF YOU'RE A PARENT AND SOMEBODY HAS LOVED AS CONCERNED ABOUT YOU IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU'RE FORMALLY INVESTIGATED YOU WILL STILL FEEL THAT YOU'RE UNDER THREAT THAT YOUR CHILD IS UNDER THREAT THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO LOSE YOUR CHILD LOVER MARK FOUND YOU THINK DO YOU THAT WE HAVE GOT THIS WRONG AS A SOCIETY AND THAT ACTUALLY EXTRA CASELOAD THAT WE'RE PUTTING ON TO PEOPLE WHO WORK IN CHILDREN'S SERVICES WE SHOULDN'T
YES AND SOME OF THAT IS TO DO WITH OTHER PROFESSIONALS WHO WORRY BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS MANTRA WHICH SAYS IT'S EVERYBODY'S JOB TO SAFEGUARD CHILDREN UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'RE DOING DOESN'T SAFEGUARD CHILDREN CREATING THIS HUGE NUMBER OF REFERRALS HAVE CONCERNS IS LIKE CREATING A HUGE EXTRA BIG
STUCK IN WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE NEEDLE OF THE CHILDREN WHO ARE REALLY AT RISK IT REALLY MAKES IT HARDER PROFESSOR ANDY WILSON THANK YOU LET'S TURN TO PROFESSOR JULIAN A GROUND IS PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL POLICY AT THE L.S. FORM A GOVERNMENT ADVISER DID A REPORT INTO BIRMINGHAM CHILDREN'S SERVICES A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DO YOU THINK HE'S RIGHT
I THINK THAT HE'S A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THIS GENERAL ISSUE AND ALL CREDIT TO HIM FINDING OUT THIS THIS REALLY RATHER SHOCKING FIGURES I'M NOT AS SANGUINE KEY AS THOUGH THAT MANY OF THESE REFERRALS ARE NECESSARY IF YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF THE SO CALLED TOXIC TRIO IS THESE ARE THE TRIO OF FACTORS THAT LEAD TO THE REST OF THE CHILD ABUSE YOU'VE GOT THREE OF THEM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
MENTAL ILL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE MISUSE ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN ON THE INCREASE ESPECIALLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE'RE MUCH MORE AWARE THESE DAYS OF THE DAMAGE DONE TO CHILDREN OF WITH FAMILIES WHERE THERE IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN ON THE INCREASE THE AWARENESS THAT'S ON THE INCREASE OR THE ACTUALITY AS WELL I THINK IT'S PROBABLY THE AWARENESS BUT HIS AWARENESS OF A REAL PROBLEM AND THE PROBLEM IS REALLY THAT IT'S JUST IT'S BEEN CONCEALED FOR QUITE A LONG TIME WE'RE BECOMING MORE AWARE
THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION WHICH AGAIN MAKES THE POINT THAT I'M SOCIAL WORKERS ACTUALLY THE NUMBER ACTUAL INVESTIGATION'S THEY TAKE A LOT OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS PEER TO BE UNNECESSARY ALL THEY TOLD THEM WE FOUND IN BIRMINGHAM THERE WAS INDEED A PROBLEM BUT IT WAS A RATHER DIFFERENT KIND OF PROBLEM THAT THAT
PROFESSIONALS HEAD TEACHERS AND SO ON WERE COMPLAINED THAT BIRMINGHAM CHILDREN'S OVERSEAS WERE TURNING DULL REFUSING TO INVESTIGATE CASES THAT SEEM TO THEM TO BE PERFECTLY SERIOUS THERE'S A LOT OF AND I DO WHAT THEY CALL IN THE JARGON AND IDENTIFIED NEED IN BIRMINGHAM AND
RATHER SIMILAR ACTUALLY WE FOUND THAT SOME RODS AND A SITUATION THAT IN THERE I MEAN BUT ONE ANSWER THAT MIGHT BE FROM THESE FIGURES THAT POSSIBLY THERE'S BEEN TOO MUCH OF THEIR TIME DEALING WITH CASES SHOULDN'T BE DEALING WITH THAT ACTUALLY I GENUINELY RATHER MINOR SHE'S NOT SEEING THE WOOD FOR THE TREES WELL
WHAT CERTAINLY THAT'S THE FEAR AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SOCIAL WORKERS IN BLOWING AROUND INDEED ELSEWHERE APPLY VERY HIGH STANDARDS VERY HIGH THRESHOLDS TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WILL INVESTIGATE AND WHAT THEY WILL NOT AS I SAY THERE A JUDGEMENT IN BOURBON WAS AT THOSE THRESHOLDS WERE TOO HIGH BUT THEY WERE ACTUALLY
SETTING THE SETTING TO HIRE BAR BEFORE ENGAGING IN A RESTORATION PARTLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE PRESSURES THE RUDDER PARTLY BECAUSE OF SOME SPECIFIC THINGS TO DO WITH BIRMINGHAM BUT DOUGLAS THE PROBLEMS WERE ALREADY THERE TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THAT PARTICULAR WITH YOUR SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF BERNIE WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THAT BEING TAKEN OVER BY A TRUST
THAT IT WILL MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE I THINK IT WILL MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE WE ALSO INVESTIGATED DONCASTER AND WE RECOMMENDED THAT IN GLOUCESTER'S CLOSE AND DOGS THEY DID MOVE TO AN INDEPENDENT TRUST WE WAS ONE OF THE OPTIONS WE CONSIDERED FOR BIRMINGHAM WE ACTUALLY GAVE THEM STAY OF EXECUTION OF A YEAR OR TWO WHICH WAS A MISTAKEN RETROSPECT
I THINK WE I THINK IT WAS A RISKY DECISION AND WE WERE VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE RISK AT THE TIME I THINK RIGHT WHY WAS THAT STAY OF EXECUTION GRANTED WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE A GREATER FAITH IN THEIR MANAGEMENT THAN WE DID IN DONCASTER
THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE NEW MANAGEMENT OF TIME FROM SOCIAL WORKERS AND OTHERS AND WE THOUGHT WELL LET'S SEE WHETHER THEY CAN TURN IT ROUND ON THEIR OWN JUST INKED IN TEN SECONDS KEPT QANTAS SOCIAL WORKERS IN BIRMINGHAM AND ELSEWHERE AS WELL COPE DO YOU THINK WITH THE CASELOAD THAT FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO COPE WITH
I THINK WITHIN LOCAL AUTHORITIES THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH LACK OF RESOURCES BUT IT ISN'T ONLY THAT MANY CHILDREN SERVES AS A RIDIN A PROBLEM KIND OF CULTURAL DECLINE THAT THE ISOLATED THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN AND THEY'RE UNABLE TO TO REFORM THEMSELVES HENCE THE IDEA OF A NEW INSTITUTION
LIKE AN INDEPENDENT TRUST CHANGES THE CULTURAL PROFESSOR JULIAN AGROUND AND PROFESSOR ANDY BILSON EARLIER AS WELL THANKS BOTH EMMA THREE MINUTE TO EAT WHETHER FILLING FOR A NICK AT THE CANCER I'M AFRAID SO PAY ATTENTION AT THE BACK SOUTH WALES SOUTH WEST ENGLAND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THE SOUTH MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA MUCH CLOUDY AFFAIR THAN WAS THE CASE YESTERDAY AND THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WILL PROBABLY HAVE THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE THROUGHOUT THE DAY MAYBE THE ODD SPOT IN THE SOUTH OF WALES TOO

IN THE PAST AND VOTE LEAVE HAS DESCRIBED IT AS A PAID UP PROPAGANDA ARM OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THE EYE AFFAIRS REACH SOME BRUISING CONCLUSIONS FOR THE BRECHT'S AT CAMP THEY SUGGEST CLAIMS OUTSIDE THE E.U. BRITAIN WOULD RECOVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION POUNDS A WEEK ARE ABSURD
THE TRUE FIGURE THEY SAY WOULD BE AROUND HALF OR MAYBE EVEN A QUARTET OF THAT THEY ALSO WORN BY THE END OF THIS PARLIAMENT SLOWER GROWTH WOULD MEAN A TWENTY TO FORTY BILLION POUND HIT TO THE PUBLIC FINANCES THIS WOULD REQUIRE FURTHER CUTS AND TAX RISES THAT WERE POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND THEREFORE THEY SAY THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE UP TO TWO YEARS MORE ASTAIRE PARITY TO BALANCE THE BOOKS
WHILE SUCH CONCLUSIONS WILL DELIGHT THE GOVERNMENT THEY WILL PERHAPS BE EVEN MORE CHEERED BY THE FACT THAT IT'S THE EYE F.S. OFTEN A CRITIC OF GOVERNMENT BUDGETS WHO'VE REACHED THEM
THE STANDING OF THE EYE AFFAIRS IS SUCH THAT IT'S OFTEN REGARDED AS MORE CREDIBLE THAN ANY OTHER FORECASTER OR INDEED MINISTER
LEAVE CAMPAIGN WHO QUESTIONED THE INSTITUTE'S FIGURES THIS MORNING DEFENDED THEIR CLAIM IT WAS PRO Y. YOU BECAUSE THEY SAID IT HAD RECEIVED MORE THAN FIVE MILLION POUNDS IN GRANTS FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION THEY ALSO POINTED OUT THE EYE AFFAIRS RISKED LOSING ELEVEN PERCENT OF ITS INCOME IF BRITAIN VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U.

WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME PERHAPS TELLING THEM WHAT THEY WANT AND NOT HEARING WHAT THEY REALLY NEED AND WE'VE GOT A VERY CLEAR IDEA OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND MISSUS M. AND S. WE NEED TO CHERISH AND CELEBRATE HER AND MAKE SURE WE'RE GIVEN EXACTLY WHAT SHE NEEDS AT THE RIGHT TIME
THERE'S THE COST OF TURNING AROUND THIS PART OF THE BUSINESS TOGETHER WITH DIFFICULT TRADING CONDITIONS WILL HIT ITS PROFITS IN THE SHORT TERM IN THE YEAR TO THE SECOND OF APRIL UNDERLYING PRE TAX PROFITS OF THE COMPANY ROSE FOUR POINT THREE PERCENT TO SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION POUNDS
THE BOARD OF THE INDIAN FIRM TATA WILL MEET IN THEM BUYING TODAY TO DRAW UP A SHORTLIST OF PREFERRED BIDDERS FOR ITS U.K. STEEL OPERATIONS THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SERGEY JAVID AND THE FIRST MINISTER OF WALES CARWYN JONES HAVE TRAVELLED TO INDIA TO HOLD TALKS WITH TARTAR OFFICIALS ARE BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK REPORTS
THE BOARD OF TATA STEEL ARE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE PREFERRED BIDDERS FROM THE EIGHT WHO ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE SUBMITTED PROPOSALS THAT JOB WAS MADE EASIER WHEN TWO OF THEM JOIN FORCES EXCALIBUR STEEL AS A MANAGEMENT LED BID WHICH WELL BEGONE EXPERIENCE IS LIGHT ON CASH ACCORDING TO WELSH FIRST MINISTER CARWYN JONES
LIBERTY HOUSE WHICH IS ALREADY BOUGHT ASSETS FROM TATA HAD PLANS TO REPLACE THE EXISTING STEEL PRODUCTION FURNACES WITH LESS COSTLY STEEL RECYCLING FURNACES THE TWO GROUPS NOW THINK THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER BY HAVING PRODUCTION AND RECYCLING CO EXISTING AT LEAST FOR A WHILE THE B. B. C. UNDERSTANDS THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT'S FAVOURITE OPTION AS IT WOULD SEEM MORE JOB SAVED THAN SOME OF THE OTHER BIDDERS FROM THE U.S. CHINA AND INDIA
THE AFGHAN TALIBAN SAYS IT HAS APPOINTED A NEW LEADER DAYS AFTER MALALA WAS KILLED IN AN AMERICAN DRONE STRIKE IN PAKISTAN HE'S HYPER TO ATHENS THERE ARE RELIGIOUS CLERIC WHO SERVED AS HEAD OF THE JUDICIARY WHEN THE TALIBAN RULED AFGHANISTAN
AS LEADERS OF THE G. SEVEN INDUSTRIALISED NATIONS GATHER IN JAPAN THE REPORT SHOWS THAT BRITAIN STANDS ALONE AMONG MAJOR COUNTRIES IN MEETING INTERNATIONAL FOREIGN AID TARGETS IT SAYS THE U.K. IS SPENDING NEARLY TWICE AS MUCH AS OTHER G.SEVEN MEMBERS DOWNING STREET SAID U.K. INVESTMENT IN OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT WAS FIRMLY IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE REPORTS FROM THE SUMMIT AND THE JAPANESE COASTAL RESORT OF HIS SO SHIMMER
BRITAIN SPENDS MORE THAN THIRTEEN BILLION POUNDS A YEAR ON OVERSEAS AID SOME POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF NATIONAL INCOME THAT'S NO SURPRISE IT'S GOVERNMENT POLICY BUT WHAT IS SURPRISING IS HOW MUCH LESS OTHER INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES ARE SPENDING THEMSELVES
THE FIRST G. SEVEN COMPARISON FOR THREE YEARS COMPILED BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT SHOWS THAT NONE OF THE OTHER SIX COUNTRIES COMES CLOSE TO THE POINT SEVEN PERCENT TARGET AND THEIR EIGHT SPENDING IS LARGELY UNCHANGING AND LOW
GERMANY SPENDS ABOUT POINT FOUR PER CENT UNITED STATES POINT TWO PER CENT ITALY EVEN LESS
ALTHOUGH DAVID CAMERON IS PROUD OF HIS RECORD AND AID SPENDING IT IS OPPOSED BY MANY IN HIS PARTY AND SOME OF THE PRESS AND AS HE ARRIVES IN JAPAN HOPING TO GAIN FRESH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE E.U. AROUND WITH AID WILL BE AN UNWELCOME DISTRACTION
A REPORT BY THE SPENDING WATCHDOG THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS THE QUALITY OF SERVICE PROVIDED BY H.M. REVENUE AND CUSTOMS COLLAPSED BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND LAST OCTOBER HIM H.M.R.C. HE SAID IT HAD NOW FULLY RECOVERED AND SERVICE LEVELS WERE BETTER THAN THEY'D BEEN FOR YEARS IT'S A PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT SIMON GONE
THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS THE QUALITY OF SERVICE AT H.M.R.C. DISINTEGRATED AFTER HER DECISION TO CUT ELEVEN THOUSAND STAFF THE HOPE HAD BEEN THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET INFORMATION THEY NEEDED AND FILL IN THEIR TAX RETURNS ONLINE BUT MILLIONS ARE STILL TELEPHONED FOR HELP AND WERE LEFT HANGING ON THE LINE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF STAFF THE AVERAGE WAITING TIME PEAKED AT FORTY SEVEN MINUTES
THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE PUTS THE TOTAL COST TO THE PUBLIC LAST YEAR AT NINETY SEVEN MILLION POUNDS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CALL CHARGES THE VALUE OF THEIR TIME AND IT SAYS THE BACKLOG OF HIGH PRIORITY CASES WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PAYING THE WRONG AMOUNT OF TAX BALLOONED TO MORE THAN THREE MILLION BECAUSE STAFF HAD TO BE MOVED FROM SORTING OUT TAX PROBLEMS TO ANSWERING PHONES
THERE'S BEEN A SHARP DROP IN THE AMOUNT OF ANTIBIOTICS PRESCRIBED BY G.P.S IN ENGLAND N.H.S. FIGURES SHOW THAT IN THE PAST YEAR THERE WERE TWO POINT SIX MILLION FEWER PRESCRIPTIONS THAN IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM
THERE'S BEEN A BIG PUSH WITH DOCTORS AND PATIENTS THROUGH GUIDELINES AND PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGNS TO CUT UNNECESSARY PRESCRIBING OF ANTIBIOTICS THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE OVER CAN CAUSE BACTERIA TO BECOME RESISTANT MAKING IT HARDER TO TREAT INFECTIONS SOMETHING THAT SEEN AS A HUGE THREAT TO PATIENTS' SAFETY
THEY'VE ALSO BEEN FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO GET G.P.S TO CUT DOWN ON PRESCRIBING THE TARGET WAS TRADUCED PRESCRIPTIONS BY ONE PER CENT THE TOTAL FELL BY MORE THAN SEVEN PER CENT HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY IT'S A FANTASTIC RESULT
THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT OF CUBA HAS SAID IT WILL LEGALISE SMALL OR MEDIUM SIZED PRIVATE BUSINESSES THE AUTHORITIES CURRENTLY ALLOW PRIVATE ENTERPRISE BY SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS SUCH AS RESTAURANT OWNERS AND HAIRDRESSERS MANY OF WHOM HAVE TAKEN ON OTHER STAFF
CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THERE ARE FAMOUSLY LONG THESE DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS IT'S POLITICIANS WERE OF COURSE USUALLY ACCUSED OF TELLING HIS LIES WHEREAS THOSE NICE PEOPLE AT THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES OR IN ROUTINE TIMES FETED FOR SUPPLYING US WITH THE UNVARNISHED IF SOMETIMES SOMEWHAT UNCOMFORTABLE STATISTICAL TRUTH
TODAY THE I.S.S. GIVES US THEIR VERDICT ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF LEAVING ME YOU THE EIGHT BILLION POUND EXTRA THEY SAY WE GAIN FROM NO LONGER HAVE TO PAY A MEMBERSHIP FEE WOULD BE DWARFED BY THE EXTRA COST OF LOWER TRADE AND GREATER ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY
THESE THOUGH ARE NOT NORMAL TIMES UNLIKE AFTER MOST BUDGETS WHEN THEIR ANALYSIS IS AWAITED WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THEY ARE FIRST FINDS ITSELF DRAGGED INTO THE REFERENDUM MUD THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IS ALLEGING TODAY THAT THEY ARE THEY PAID UP PROPAGANDA ON OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
WE'RE JOINED BY PAUL JOHNSON IS DIRECTOR OF THE IFE S. AND IN A MOMENT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTER JOHN REDWOOD WHO OF COURSE BACKS THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN A BALL I'M GONNA START ACTUALLY WITH THAT ALLEGATION FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE THERE PAID UP PROPAGANDA ARM OF THE COMMISSION THEY SAY BECAUSE YOU GET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS EACH YEAR IN RESEARCH FUNDING FROM BRUSSELS
WELL IT'S TRUE WE GET ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF OUR INCOME FROM SOMETHING CALLED THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT ARM'S LENGTH BODY WHICH FUNDS WORLD CLASS ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN COUNTRIES AS DIVERSE AS NORWAY AND ISRAEL WHICH ARE WELL OUTSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THAT THAT FUND SOME OF THE MORE ACADEMIC END OF THE RESEARCH THAT WE DO AND CERTAINLY DOESN'T IMPACT ON THIS KIND OF WORK BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS
THE EYE IS REALLY BUILT ITS REPUTATION ON THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF OUR WORK AND ACTUALLY THERE IS NO SUM OF MONEY FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHICH WOULD INFLUENCE WHAT WE SAID BECAUSE IF IT DID THEN THE POINT OF THE IFE ESSEN THE REASONS THAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO EARLIER WE ARE LISTENED TO AFTER BUDGETS AND SO ON WOULD SIMPLY BE LOST LET'S GO THROUGH THE ARGUMENTS THEMSELVES TAKING IT SLOWLY IF YOU WOULD STEP AT A TIME FIRST OF ALL THE CASH YOU GET BACK IF YOU LEAVE THE SIMPLE THING IS
YOU STOP PAYING A MEMBERSHIP FEE NOW THERE'S BEEN GREAT CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE FIGURE THAT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION MOUND A WEEK IS EMBLAZONED ON THE BUS WE SEE EVERY DAY ON THE TELEVISION NEWS YOU PUT THE FIGURE EACH YEAR AS A SAVING OF EIGHT BILLION POUNDS QUITE A LOT LESS THEM ADDING UP ALL THOSE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WHY
THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK IS A FULL GROSS CONTRIBUTION TO THE Y. YOU BEFORE WE GET A RE BACK REBATE BACK THE REBATE THERE MISSUS THATCHER FAMOUSLY NEGOTIATED BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND BEFORE WE TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE MONEY WE GET BACK TO PETER ARE FARMERS AND SO ON SO THE THREE UP TO TO HAVE THAT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AFTER WE LEFT THE Y. YOU YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME SOMETHING RATHER BIZARRE WHICH IS THAT WE HAD LEFT WE STOPPED PAYING CONTRIBUTIONS
OUR CURRENT PARTNERS NEVERTHELESS CONTINUE TO PIERCE A REBATE ON CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE WEREN'T MAKING THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FROM AND THEN IN ADDITION THERE'S ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION OR SO A BIT LESS THAN THAT WHICH WE GET BACK TO PAGE OF FARMERS AND SO MUCH WE COULD DECIDE TO SPEND ON SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BUT PROBABLY MOST OF THAT'LL CERTAINLY SOME OF IT WILL CONTINUE TO GO IN THE SAME DIRECTION
BUT IT'S A BIG SUM NEVERTHELESS AND THERE'S AN ANSWER JOHN REDWOOD WILL GIVE IT A SECOND TO WHAT YOU'VE SAID BUT IT'S A HUGE SUM OF MONEY EIGHT BILLION POUNDS FAIR ENOUGH EIGHT BILLION NINE MILLION BILLION TEN BILLION LET'S JUST HAVE IT THAT WOULD BE GREAT WHY DO YOU SAY THAT OVERALL THOUGH WE WOULD NOT GET THAT MONEY
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT EIGHT BILLION POUNDS IS MORE THAN WORTH HAVING IT'S ABOUT ONE PER CENT OF EVERYTHING THAT WE SPEND THAT AT THE MOMENT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHAT REALLY MATTERS FOR THE PUBLIC FINANCES GOING FORWARD IS THE SIZE OF THE ECONOMY THE ECONOMY WERE TO BE ABOUT HALF A PER CENT SMALLER THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING FOR THEN YOU LOSE THAT YOU LOSE THAT EIGHT BILLION POUNDS BECAUSE YOU GET LESS IN THE WAY OF TAX REVENUES IN NOW LOOKING OUT
PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE ECONOMIC FORECASTING THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE SHORT RUN INITIALLY FOR WHAT WILL BE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION MOST FORECASTER SUGGEST IT WOULD BE
A CUT IN OUR NATIONAL INCOME RELATIVE TO WHAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN HALF A PER CENT AND THAT'S DOWN TO THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IMMEDIATELY WE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TRADE DEALS AND SOME WE'D END UP WITH THEM THEY'RE FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT WILL PROBABLY REDUCE INVESTMENT WILL REDUCE HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION WOULD REDUCE THAT WOULD MAKE US WORSE OFF HE'S THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THIS ISN'T IT
YOUR MODEL IS BASED ON THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE'S MODEL MANY OF THESE ECONOMIC MODELS ARE THE SAME AND THE KEY TO WHAT YOU GET OUT OF THEM IS THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT YOU PUT IN AND YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY ALL OF YOU MAINSTREAM ECONOMIC FORECASTERS VERY PESSIMISTIC ABOUT BRITAIN'S ABILITY TO GET A BETTER TRADING RELATIONSHIP AFTER LEAVING THEM BEFORE AND IF YOU PUT IN THE ASSUMPTIONS EVER SAY JOHN REDWOOD YOU GET A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FIGURE
THERE'S TWO ASPECTS HERE ACTUALLY YOU CANNOT GET THE BEST TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION THAN THE ONE WE ALREADY HAVE IT IS IT IS AS FREE AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE BETWEEN ONE COUNTRY AND ANOTHER SET OF COUNTRY MIGHT BE LIBERATED TO GET BETTER TRADING A REG'S WITH OTHER COUNTRIES SO THAT HIS POTS AT THE MOMENT NEARLY HALF FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF OUR EXPORTS GO INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WHATEVER DEAL WE CAME OUT WITH WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE DEAL WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT I THINK THAT IS ON CONTROVERSIAL WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION
WITH RESPECT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD YOU ALREADY HAS THREE DOZEN OR SO BIG TRADE ARRANGEMENTS IT'S ALREADY SET SORT IT'S A LONG WAY DOWN THE ROAD OF SORTING SOMETHING OUT WITH UNITED STATES NOW IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE MODELLING THAT FOR EXAMPLE PATRICK MINFORD HAS DONE WHAT HE'S ASSUMED IS NOT THAT WE
RE RENEGOTIATE ALL OF THESE THINGS WE'LL JUST THROW A BORDER'S OPEN WE'LL GET RID OF ALL OF TARIFFS COMING INTO THE U.K. PROBABLY LEAVE THE TARIFFS AT THE REST THE WORLD CHARGE ON OUR EXPORTS THE SAME
IN THE VERY LONG ON THAT COULD HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT WAS IT WILL MAKE IMPORTS CHEAPER AND IT WALKED SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE WAY THE BRITISH ECONOMY WORKS HE SAYS HIMSELF IT WOULD CLOSE DOWN MUCH OF MANUFACTURING SOME OF AGRICULTURE TO BE REPLACED WITH MORE WITH MORE PRODUCTIVE SERVICES
WHETHER THAT WOULD HAPPEN I THINK IT'S FIRST RATE DOUBTFUL OF THE TRANSITION COSTS WILL BE REALLY VERY SUBSTANTIAL INDEED WELL LET'S TURN TO JOHN REDWOOD NOW THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE CABINET MINISTER OF CAUSE MORNING TO YOU MISTER EDWARD CAN WE GET OUT OF THE WAY WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THAT MISTER JOHNSON BELIEVES WHAT HE'S SAYING OR OR SIMPLY SAYING IT COS BRUSSELS SENDS A CHEQUE TO THE I.R.S.
I THINK THE EYE OF A PART OF THIS COSY ESTABLISHMENT WHICH DESPERATELY WANTS TO KEEP US IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THEY THEY HAVE ON THIS BROCHURE THEY'VE ISSUED TODAY YOU CAME OR CHANGING YOUR LOGO THEY SAY IT'S PAID FOR BY THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL AND THEY CLEARLY BUY INTO THIS GENERAL VIEW
THAT THERE WOULD BE UNSPECIFIED NEGATIVES ON OUR TRADE WHERE WE HAD TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THERE'S A DIFFERENCE ISN'T THERE MISTER EDWARD BETWEEN BEING PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT THAT MAY BE TRUE THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAYING THEY'RE WRONG
THEY MAY WELL BE WRONG BUT THE ALLEGATION BEING MADE IS THAT THEY ARE IN THE PAY OF BRUSSELS AND THEREFORE NOT SAYING WHAT THEY BELIEVE BUT SAYING WHAT THEY'RE PAID TO SAY WHICH IS A VERY SERIOUS CHARGE WHAT WE JUST HEARD THAT THEY THEY DO GET MONEY FROM EUROPEAN BODIES AND THEY GET MONEY FROM BRITISH OFFICIAL BODIES AS WELL BUT I'D RATHER CONCENTRATE ON GEOGRAPHY I KNOW WHAT YOU'D RATHER COMES ROUND WE NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT PULLING BACK FROM THE ALLEGATION THAT THEY SEE THESE THINGS COS THEY'RE PAID
I HAVEN'T MADE THAT ALLEGATION DON'T LEAVE HATS WELL FINE BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE ON PEOPLE'S JOBS AND I BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE AND THIS EYE FEST PANTHER IT DOESN'T PRESENT A NEW MODEL OR A NEW FORECAST IT REVIEWS A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FOR CARS AND IT HAPPENS TO CHOOSE ONE OF THE MORE NEGATIVE ONES ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXIT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO LIKE THE OPEN EUROPE ONE OR THE ECONOMISTS FOR BRECHT'S IT ONE WHO WHO SAY WE WILL BE
BETTER OFF ON VARIOUS SCENARIOS I THINK WE'D BE BETTER OFF OUT OF THIS I DO AGREE WITH THE EYE FIRST AT THE FIRST ROUND EFFECT IS ONCE YOU CANCEL OUR CONTRIBUTIONS YOU'VE GOT AN IMPORTANT BOOST TO THE BRITISH ECONOMY I THINK IT'S TEN BILLION THEY SAY EIGHT BILLION IT'S MORE THAN HALF A PER CENT OF OUR G.D.P. BOOST SO IN ORDER TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORSE OFF OUT YOU THEN HAVE TO FIND THINGS THAT WOULD MORE THAN OFFSET
THAT BOOST GETTING RID OF AUSTERITY SPENDING MORE MONEY ON JOBS SOME SERVICES IN BRITAIN A NEW HAVE I SHOULD GET AWAY AND DON'T GET TO SPEND HERE AT THE MOMENT ME JUST PUT THIS DO YOU LIKE THEY HAVE TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS IN ORDER TO GET A DIFFERENT CALCULATION NOW ANY ASSUMPTION THAT ECONOMISTS LIKE PATRICK MINFORD USED TO WORK FOR MISSUS THATCHER WHEN YOU WERE WORKING FOR MISSUS THATCHER MAKE IS THAT WE COULD
BOO STAR TRADE IT OUTSIDE BY SLASHING TERRACE OVERALL AND INDEED YOU ALSO ONE TAX CUTS AND DEREGULATION ALL OF THOSE THINGS OFF FED INTO THE ECONOMIC MODELS THAT PRODUCE A DIFFERENT RESULT
YES THEY COULD BE BUT THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY WHAT I'M RECOMMENDING TODAY I'M SAYING THAT WE WILL GET THAT FIRST ROUND BOOST BY GETTING RID OF SOME OF THE AUSTERITY AND SPENDING THE MONEY WE DESPERATELY NEED ON HEALTH SERVICE AND OTHER SERVICES IN BRITAIN THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE TO GIVE AWAY AND DOESN'T COME BACK TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THAT WILL LEAD ON TO OTHER EFFECTS YOU COLLECT MORE TAX REVENUE IN THERE BE A GENERAL BOOSTER INCOMES WHEN YOU SPEND THAT MONEY THE ACTUAL FORECAST THEY'RE USING
DOESN'T MAINLY GET TO A NEGATIVE ANSWER BECAUSE THE TRADE IT GETS FROM NEGATIVE ANSWER BECAUSE IT SAYS THE POUND IT'S GOING TO FALL AWAY AND INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO GO UP NOW THAT WE'VE SEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND REMAIN CAMPAIGN SINCE FEBRUARY
REALLY TRY AND TALK THEM DOWN AND TALK INTEREST RATES UP DO YOU DISPUTE WHAT EVERY ECONOMIC FORECAST YES WELL DONE I CAN DO CAN I JUST EXPLAIN THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS SINCE HER BRAIN LATE THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAY THAT IT'S ALL GOING TO GO WRONG JUST ON FEARS OF BRECHT'S IT AND SINCE THEY TRIED TO TALK HIS BATTERY IS FORGIVE ME GUSTA THE ARE NOT PART OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THEY'RE NOT TALKING THE POUND AND THE MAKING AN ECONOMIC FORECAST SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO WORK OUT IS WHY AS SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS ECONOMICS
YOU DISPUTE THE FORECAST MADE NOT JUST BY THEM NOT JUST BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND NOT JUST BY THE TREASURY NOT JUST BY THE I.M.F. BUT EVERY OTHER MAJOR WORLD ECONOMIC BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING I'M TAKING FORECASTS THEY HAVE CHOSEN THEIR CHOSEN A NEGATIVE FORECAST THERE ARE POSITIVE ONES AVAILABLE IF THEY WANTED TO THEIR NEGATIVE FORECAST MAINLY PREDICATE LOWER POUND AND HIGHER INTEREST RATES I'M JUST EXPLAINING THAT SINCE THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN AND THE GOVERNMENT BEEN TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT THAT THINGS ARE GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION HAS ACTUALLY GONE UP AGAINST THE DOLLAR
GOVERNMENT INTEREST RATES ON BOMBS HAVE FALLEN A LITTLE BIT SINCE THEY STARTED THIS DREADFUL CAMPAIGN TO TALK EVERYTHING DOWN SO IT SHOWS THAT IT'S NOT WORKING LET'S JOIN SURVEYORS WE CAN HARVEY'S GOING TO FALL THROUGH THE FLOOR BECAUSE WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION O.K. THIS IS A CRUCIAL ECONOMIC RATHER THAN A POLITICAL POINT PAUL JOHNSON
IS SOMETHING THAT IS CRUCIAL TO YOUR MODEL THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE POUND FALLS AND WHY MIGHT YOU NOT BE RAW
THE THING THAT'S CRUCIAL TO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THE EXPECTATION THE ECONOMY WILL BE LESS BIG IN THE SHORT RUN FOLLOWING A AT LEAVING ME YOU THE FALLING OF THE POUND IS NOT A CRUCIAL PART OF THAT WHAT REALLY DRIVES THAT IS THE UNCERTAINTY WHICH WOULD ARRIVE
ON JUNE THE TWENTY FOURTH WHICH WOULD ON ALL ECONOMIC MODEL SUGGESTS THAT INVESTMENT AND CONSUMPTION WOULD FALL AT LEAST IN THE SHORT RUN WE CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION I THINK ABOUT THE LONG RUN ON THE IMPACT ON TRADE AND SO ON BUT IN THE SHORT RUN WE KNOW THAT INCREASED UNCERTAINTY IS BAD FOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE JOHN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU TAKE THE INVESTMENT EFFECTS SOME PEOPLE SAY PEOPLE DON'T STOP INVESTING WHAT'S BEEN VERY NOTICEABLE IN THE RUN UP TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT FOLK WHERE BRECHT'S IT MIGHT WELL WIN
THE BIG INVESTORS LET'S TAKE THE CAR COMPANIES FOR EXAMPLE THEY REAFFIRMED THAT THEY HAVE A FIVE YEAR INVESTMENT PLANS THEY LIKE BRITAIN IN OR OUT MANY OF THEM SO THEY'D RATHER WE STAYED IN BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR INVESTMENT PLANS WHEN WE LEAVE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MARKET FOR THEM VERY GOOD WORKFORCE LOTS OF SKILLS
GOOD FACTORIES ESTABLISHED HERE THEY'RE NOT SUDDENLY GOING TO DISAPPEAR IN A FIT OF PIQUE JOHN REDWOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED PAUL JOHNSON OF THE IT THANK YOU
TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT THERE'S A NEW FAVOURITE IN THE RACE TO SAVE B.H.S. JACK UH BUSINESS ADVERTISING IS HERE SIMON REVEALED WELL THIS IT REALLY IS A RACE NOW BECAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING SOME SOLUTION ON THIS RESOLUTION LAST FRIDAY AT SCEPTRE MONDAY WEDNESDAY AND I'M TOLD THAT IF WE DON'T GET A DEAL BY FRIDAY IT IS LIKELY THAT THE LIQUIDATORS WERE COME IN AND THAT WILL BE THE END OF THE ROAD TO THE COMPANY AND ITS ELEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES NOW IT DOESN'T MEAN A DEAL CAN'T BE DONE WE'VE HAD SOME FALLERS IN THIS RACE SPORTS DIRECT WILL
A BID FRONTED BY JOHN HARGREAVES WHO FOUNDED MATALAN IS NOW THOUGHT TO BE FADING THAT WAS THEIR FAVOURITE THAT LOOKS TO BE FADING WE'VE NOW GOT A NEW BIDDER IN FROM GREG TUFNELL WHO IS THE BROTHER OF PHIL AND ALSO A PORTUGUESE PARTNER JOSE MARIA AS BENT OVER IS THOUGHT TO BE BACKED BY A RICH PORTUGUESE FAMILY SO THAT IS THE LATEST FAVOURITE IF YOU LIKE TO COME TO A LAST MINUTE DEAL WITH THESE REALLY ARE
LAST MINUTES NOW AND IF WE DON'T GET SOMETHING BY THE END OF WHICH AS I SAY THE OUTCOME DOES NOT LOOK GOOD SO WE COULD HOPE THAT MAYBE THE SINISTER DAY WE MIGHT GET SOME UPDATE ON THAT SIMON THANKS
FORGIVE ME THE TIME IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST ONE AND DO YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BE FORGIVEN FOR I WAS MERELY PAUSING FOR AFFECT YES IF I WAS TO LET ME ANNOUNCE A TIME IT IS INDEED NOW HOW DO YOU GET TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHATEVER YOU DO CHARITY WORK NURSING BANKING SPORT POLITICS THE ANSWER OF COURSE IS NOT INTELLIGENCE WE SORT OF KNOW THAT DON'T WE NOR IS IT COMPLETELY LUCK THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT DRIVES PEOPLE AND IT IS SUMMED UP
IN ONE SHORT WORD GRIT SUMMED UP AT LEAST BY ANGELA DUCKWORTH IS PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND AUTHOR OF GRIT THE POWER OF PASSION AND PERSEVERANCE AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU HIYA GOOD MORNING CAN I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY WELL YES WE PROBABLY AGREE WITH THAT WE PROBABLY THOUGHT WE ALREADY KNEW IT BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU GET IT DEVELOP IT HAVE IT
THAT'S MY LIFE'S WORK I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST AND I DEEPLY BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING THAT YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE ELSE AND SAY I'D LIKE TO BE A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF EXACTLY INTO THAT PERSON BUT YOU CAN SAY WHAT DOES A PRISON BELIEVE IN WHAT DO THEY DO THEIR HABITS WHAT CAN I SORT OF IMITATE
HIS GRIT DETERMINATION WAS THAT WE WERE TALKING YEAH BUT IS IT IT'S GOT TWO PARTS RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S DETERMINATION WHICH IS KIND OF DOING SOMETHING THAT'S HARD EVEN WHEN EVERYONE TELLS YOU YOU CAN'T DO IT IT'S WORKING IN A KIND OF DAILY DISCIPLINED WAY TO GET BETTER BUT IT'S ALSO DIRECTION ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ALSO WORKING ON THE SAME THING THE SAME KIND OF PROJECT IF YOU WORK WITH DETERMINATION ON LOTS OF OTHER PROJECTS THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET VERY FAR
SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE IF YOU'RE GRITTY THAT SOMEONE WHO IS DETERMINED OCCASIONALLY ABOUT THINGS BUT NOT GREAT HE DOESN'T
I THINK THEIR CONSTANCY INTERACTION WHICH BY THE WAY HAS BEEN NOTED ABOUT HIGH ACHIEVERS FORRO LONG BEFORE I CAME AROUND RIGHT SO EVEN BACK TO EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE THE VERY FIRST STUDY OF HIGH ACHIEVERS THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE WORKING IN A CONSTANT DIRECTION FOR EXAMPLE ISAAC NEWTON NO WET WHAT HIS BIOGRAPHERS WILL TELL YOU IS THAT IN ADDITION TO HIS LUMINARY MIND HE WOULD COME BACK TO THE SAME PROBLEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN FAR ALONG AFTER OTHER PEOPLE WOULD GET BORED AND JUST MOVE ON SO HOW DO YOU TWO HOW DO YOU WELL CAN YOU TEACH IT
I BELIEVE THE GRID CAN BE LEARNED I THINK THAT YOU CAN SAY THEREFORE THINGS ABOUT GRITTY PEOPLE EACH OF WHICH YOU COULD WORK ON ONE IS HAVING A DEEP INTEREST IN SOMETHING THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN INTENTIONALLY DOING A FIGURE OUT WAYS TO FIND NO WHAT'S IN WHAT YOU DO AS OPPOSED TO NOVELTY THE SEC IT IS THAT YOU COULD LEARN TO PRACTISE LIKE AN EXPERT WORKING EACH DAY ON ONE SMALL THING THAT YOU COULD GET BETTER AT THE THIRD IS CULTIVATING A SENSE OF
A BIT OF A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO OTHER PEOPLE AND THE LAST THING AND I KNOW THE SOUNDS QUITE AMERICAN BUT I DO THINK THAT YOU CAN CULTIVATE HOPE I THINK THAT YOU CAN BE A VERY OPTIMISTIC PERSON NOT ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC YOU CAN'T EAT ALL OF THESE THINGS THEN THAT CAN BE DONE BECAUSE AN OLD THE SERIOUS AS YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY THINK A VERY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE QUALITIES BUT ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF PUBLIC POLICY
WHAT REALLY MATTERS DOESN'T IT I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS IN THIS AREA OF DEALING WITH DEPRIVED CHILDREN AND SEEING WHAT IT IS THAT CAN IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE AND IT'S A MASSIVE ISSUE IN PUBLIC POLICY OBVIOUSLY DID DO YOU SEE IN THIS REALISTICALLY WAYS IN WHICH
TEACHING
CAN CHANGE PEOPLE AND SHOULD BE ALTERED ITSELF YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN AND OUR SOCIETY THEY HAD THE RE USED ONE IN TO THAT IS SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY SPEND MORE OF THEIR WAKING HOURS AT LEAST MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH THEIR TEACHERS THAN THEY DO WITH ANYBODY ELSE I MEAN INCLUDING THEIR FAMILIES REALLY SO I WAS A TEACHER I TAUGHT KIDS IN IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL AND I WOULD TELL YOU THAT
IN THAT CLASSROOM WHEN YOU SHUT THAT DOOR YOU CREATE A CULTURE YOU CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IT CAN BE THE TWO THINGS THAT I THINK ENCOURAGE GRIP WHICH IS SUPPORTIVE AND ALSO CHALLENGING IT'S THAT COMBINATION SO IF WE HAVE GREAT TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM OR MODELLING GRIP GIVING COULD SUPPORT AND CHALLENGE THAT IS ONE WAY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN HELP I'LL BE STOOD VIENNA TO CHILDREN AND IF YOUR PARENTS AREN'T GRITTY WHICH A LOT OF THESE TWO BUT I MEAN JUST A HOPELESS INADEQUATE
DON'T THEN CAN'T MANAGE THEIR OWN LIVES YOU'RE SAYINGS THAT THIS GRIPS CAN BE INSERTED AS IT WERE BY SOMEONE ELSE COS THAT'S THE CRUCIAL POINT WELL YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SOUND SO EASY RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT YOU CAN INSERT GRIT IN THE KIND OF THE LIKELY KIEREN DOWNLOAD IT KIND OF WAY HOWEVER AND I'M ALSO NOT DISCOUNTING BY THE WAY THE ROYAL FAMILY IS BECAUSE THIS IS AN ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON CHILDREN
AS SOMEBODY WHO CARES ABOUT KIDS AND IT WAS SOMEONE WHO CANNOT CHANGE THOSE FAMILIES I THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO ALL RIGHT I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION YOU KNOW IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN EVEN IF IT'S NOT A CONCRETE SOLUTION WHICH IT'S NOT ANGELA DUCKWORTH PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THANK YOU THE BOOK IS CALLED GRIP THE POWER OF PASSION AND PERSEVERANCE AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHETHER YOUR GRITTY
WE HAVE ANGELA DUCKWORTH'S TEST ON OUR FACEBOOK SITE
I WASN'T LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT UNI IF YOU LOOK AT IT AND THEY GOT OF DUBIOUS AWAY I'D LIKE HIM TO THINK YOU'RE TWENTY THANKS I THOUGHT OF EIGHT CHRIS WILL TAKE OVER THE PROGRAMME BRIEFLY NOW I LOVE FRESH ABRASIONS AGAINST SOME GRITTY SPORT YES HELLO YOU NIGGER THE MAIN HEADLINES THIS MORNING FOR YOU MANCHESTER UNITED FANS WILL HAVE TO WAIT A LITTLE LONGER BEFORE JOSIE IS INSTALLED AS THE CLUB'S NEW MANAGER A SECOND DAY OF TALKS BETWEEN HIS AGENT AND THE CLUB WILL TAKE PLACE IN LONDON TODAY

ANDY MURRAY HAD A FEW THINGS TO GET OFF HIS CHEST AT THE FRENCH OPEN TENNIS YESTERDAY HE WAS RESPONDING TO SUGGESTIONS THAT HE'S ON COURT BEHAVIOUR WAS THE REASON FOR PARTING COMPANY FROM HIS COACH FAMILY HERE'S WHAT MARIE HAD TO SAY AFTER HIS FIRST ROUND VICTORY OVER RELIC STEP AND I SAW THAT
I WAS A COMPLEX PERSON ON THE COURT AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH AS FAR AS BEING THE REASON WHY WE STOPPED WORKING TOGETHER THAT IS UNTRUE WHEN WE SAT DOWN AND SPOKEN WITH DREW
AT NO STAGE WAS THAT MENTIONED FOR ME THAT'S OBVIOUSLY FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU CAN
WHEN WHEN YOU READ THAT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUES AT ALL THAT'S UNFAIR TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
LET'S SPEAK TO CORRESPOND RUSSELL FULLER WHO'S ON THE LINE NOW FROM PARIS MORNING TEA RUSSELL GOOD MORNING CHRIS VERY MEASURED THEIR FROM MARIE WASN'T IT BUT HOW FRUSTRATING FOR HIM TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF
HE WAS VERY EMOTIONAL PARTLY BECAUSE HE'S JUST GONE THROUGH A VERY STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE OVER TWO DAYS IN TRY TO BEAT THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD RELIC STEP NECK IN FIVE SETS BUT ALSO BECAUSE AS YOU HEARD THERE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT SOME OF THE INTERPRETATION OF WHEREAS MOST COMMENTS OVER THE WEEKEND SHE GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO THEY WHERE SHE SAID QUITE CLEARLY THE MAIN REASON THAT THEY WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS WAS BECAUSE
NEW MUM SHE COULDN'T COMMIT THAT SORT OF TIME TO TRAVELLING AND BEING ON TOUR AS MURRAY WAS LOOKING FOR BUT SHE ALSO SAID THAT SHE FOUND AT TIMES HE'S ON CALL BEHAVIOUR TO BE DISCONCERTING AND SHE DID SAY THAT SHE FELT IT WAS A BARRIER TO THEIR MAKING FUTURE PROGRESS TOGETHER BUT AS YOU HEARD THERE MURRAY
QUITE EMOTIONAL AND VERY KEEN TO POINT OUT THAT IT WAS NOT HIS BEHAVIOUR EVEN THOUGH EXCEPT IT'S AN ISSUE AT TIMES THERE WAS A REASON THEY SPLIT
SO HE'S MADE HIS POINT HOW MUCH IF AT ALL IS THIS AFFECTING HIS TENNIS ON THE COURT
I DON'T THINK IT WAS THE REASON FOR THE VERY SLOW START AT ALL AGAINST RADIC STEP NECK IT WAS PLAYED OVER TWO DAYS CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN VERY COLD IN PARIS VERY OVERCAST SO HEAVY CONDITIONS ON THE COURT VERY SLOW DIDN'T SUIT MURRAY STRENGTHEN RADIC STEPAN NECK HAS
BAGS OF EXPERIENCE HE'S WON THE DAVIS CUP TWICE FOR THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND HE PLAYED PRETTY HE'LL NEED TO START AND IN THE END MURRAY WAS TAKE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CREDIT FOR FIGHTING HIS WAY BACK FROM TWO SETS DOWN AND WINNING YESTERDAY ON THE RESUMPTION TWO POINTS FROM DEFEAT AT ONE STAGE WHEN SERVING FOUR FIVE DOWN
HOLDING HIS NERVE AND WINNING THE DECIDING SET BY SEVEN GAMES TO FIVE AND PLAY MATTATHIAS BORG THE FRENCH WILDCARD IN THE SECOND ROUND TODAY WHERE YOU WOULD EXPECT
SAILING CONDITIONS WOULD BE MUCH SMOOTHER YES A BRIEF WORD VERY QUICKLY RUSTLE ON LAURA ROBSON ANOTHER DEFEAT ON HER COME BACK
AND SHE SAYS IT'S HARD TO BE POSITIVE RIGHT NOW SHE STILL RANKED AROUND THREE HUNDRED IN THE WORLD IT'S NO GREAT SURPRISE SHE LOST ANDREA PECKY WHICH FORMER SEMI FINALIST AT ROLAND GARETH'S SHE'S JUST NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ENOUGH WINS UNDER HER BELT SHE'S BEEN BACK ON TOUR OR REGULARLY NOW FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AFTER WRISTS SURGERY SHE'LL GET PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES ON THE GRASS BUT AFTER THAT SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY AT A FAIRLY LOW LEVEL VERY ON THE GLAMOROUS LOCATIONS AND TRY AND WORK THAT RANKING BACK UP

S. PAUL JOHNSON TOLD US THE POTENTIAL SHRINKING OF THE ECONOMY IMMEDIATELY AFTER HER BRECK'S IT WOULD COST THE COUNTRY MORE THAN IT WOULD SAVE
THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTER JOHN REDWOOD WHO BACKS VOTE LEAVE SAID THE EYE F. S. WAS PART OF THE COSY ESTABLISHMENT THAT DESPERATELY WANTED TO KEEP US IN THE Y. YOU
A DOZEN FORMER SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE SPOKEN OUT AGAINST BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY SAY THE E. USE PLANS FOR ITS OWN ARMY COULD UNDERMINE NATO THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN SAID THE OVERWHELMING WEIGHT OF MILITARY SECURITY OPINION FAVOURED BRITAIN STAYING IN THE
MARKS AND SPENCER HAS REPORTED A FOUR POINT THREE PERCENT RISE IN UNDERLYING PROFITS TO SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION POUNDS ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE WARNED THAT IMPROVING ITS CLOTHING AND HOME RANGERS WOULD HIT PROFITS IN THE SHORT TERM

THANK YOU THE TIME TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE EUROPE DEBATE TODAY DOMINATED BY THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES REPORT WHICH SUGGESTS THAT WE MAY WELL BE WORSE OFF IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT IT DOES COME UP WITH A VERY FIRM FIGURE FOR THE COST OF STAYING THE COST OF OUR CURRENT MEMBERSHIP LET'S TALK TO THE REMAIN CAMPAIGNER FORMER CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING LAW DARLING IS ON THE LINE HAVE MET EDWARD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THAT FIGURE
EIGHT BILLION POUNDS DO YOU ACCEPT IT BECAUSE THIS ISN'T NOW A FORECASTER WILL GET TO FORECAST IN JUST A SECOND AS AN ABSOLUTE FIRM FIGURE THE COST OF OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE NET COST
AFTER WE GET STUFF BACK FROM THEM THE NET COST TO US HE'S EIGHT BILLION POUNDS A YEAR IS IS IS THAT A FIGURE YOU ACCEPT IS THAT THE EYE THE EYE HER FIGURE WHICH IS IT IT'S A MONEY WE WOULD GET BACK BECAUSE IT'S THE CONTRIBUTION LESS THE REBATE THAT WE GET HER OVER AS PAUL JOHNSON WHO WAS TALKING TO A SHORT WHILE AGO FROM THE HIGHER FARES SAID
IF IT DOES ASSUME THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE MAKING ANY PAYMENTS TO FARMERS OR TRUDE LESS ADVANTAGED AREAS WHICH I THINK IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT YOU COULD ALL YOU HAVE TO USE THAT MONEY TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS OF YOUR MONEY YOU COULD DECIDE TO STOP SUPPORT FOR FARMERS I WOULD BE SURPRISED OF ANY GOVERNMENT WHICH ACTUALLY DO THAT AT THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT YOU HAVE YES YOU THAT YOU'D NEED TO LOOK AT THAT NUMBER BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER
WHAT IMPACT WOULD BE ON THE U.K. ECONOMY AS A WHOLE WERE WE TO LEAVE WHAT THE I F. I F. S. IS SAYING IS THAT IT WOULD ONLY TAKE A HALF A PER CENT SLOWDOWN AND OUR ECONOMY PRODUCTION THE SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY TO WHITE THAT GAIN OUT AND LIKE ALL THESE THINGS YOU NEED TO LOOK AT ALL THESE FIGURES IN THE ROUND AND THEN REACH THE BEST JUDGEMENT AS TO WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HELP YOU THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT THAT THE EIGHT BILLION IS A FAG EVERYTHING ELSE IT'S A FORECAST THAT'S AS YOU KNOW THEN AND ANYONE FORECAST
NOT ONLY CAN GO WRONG BUT USUALLY DO GO WRONG WHEN IT COMES TO THE CLICK CAN BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO AND FORECASTING IS WE'VE NOW GOT A WIDE RANGE OF ESTIMATES FROM A NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS AND THEY ALL POINT IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND THAT IS THAT IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE WOULD BE HIT ON THE ECONOMY THAT WOULD HIT JOBS IT WOULD ALSO HIT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'VE GOT TO SPEND ON SERVICES LIKE HEALTH AND EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU CAN'T SET THAT ASIDE
AND IMPORTANT JUDGEMENT THAT WE HAVE TO REACH IN A MONTH'S TIME TIMERS WHAT DO WE THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF WE REMOVE OURSELVES FROM MY MARKET A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE AND I THINK IT IS FANCIFUL TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEHOW YOU COULD GET YOU COULD LEAVE THAT SINGLE MARKET AND THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY DAMAGE WHATSOEVER PEOPLE O.K. TAKING A HUGE RISK IF YOU DO THIS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
BE CONCERNED AREN'T MADE BY THE DIVERGENCE THAT A FORECASTING BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TREASURY TELLING US THAT IT COULD COST EVERY HOUSEHOLD FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR WE NOW THE INSTITUTE FISCAL STUDIES SAY NO THAT FIGURE IS ACTUALLY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY
THAT'S HOW MUCH THEY SAY IT WOULD BE WORSE OFF IF WE WERE TO LIVE JUST ON THOSE FIGURES WHICH OF THOSE IS RIGHT DO YOU WOULD YOU WOULD DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE CAMPAIGNING TO REMAIN SHOULD STICK NOW TO THE EYE F.A.S. FIGURE OR IS THE TREASURY FIGURE STILL VALID I THINK AS WITH ALL THESE ESTIMATES AND ALL OF THIS TYPE IT DEPENDS TO SOME EXTENT THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU MAKE MY POINT IF I STAND BACK FROM ALL THIS AS YOU SAID DO YOU HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE OF
LOOKING AT FORECASTS IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BALANCE AND TAKE THE AVERAGE IF YOU LIKE THEY ALL POINT IN THE SAME DIRECTION THERE'S A TWO QUITE DIFFERENT WHAT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN FOOT HUMPHREY HUNDREDS ARE BIG DIVERGENT WHICH WHICH DO YOU THINK HE WOULD BUT THAT WHAT THEY'VE BOTH SAY IS THAT THERE WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL HIT TO OUR ECONOMY NOW MY MY POINT IS THIS
WHEN YOU ARE BEING ASKED TO TAKE A DECISION THE BIGGEST DECISION THAT THE U.K. HAS TAKEN IN A GENERATION AND REMEMBER HAVE WE LEAVE WERE OUT THERE'S NO GOING BACK THAT'S IT IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS DECISION THEN WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL THE ANALYSIS THAT'S AVAILABLE TO US AND WHAT I'M SEEING IS EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME JOHN REDWOOD DIDN'T DISPUTE THIS TO ANY MATERIAL EXTENT THEY'RE ALL POINTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION THAT WOULD BE CERTAINLY AN IMMEDIATE HIT WE'RE ALL AGREED ON THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WOULD LAST BUT THERE'LL BE A LONGER TERM
DAMAGED I'M NOT SURE JOHN REDWOOD DID AGREE WITH WITHOUT ACTUALLY HE WAS SAYING YOU WERE HE WASN'T HE WASN'T AT ALL CONVINCED THAT THE POUND WOULD WOULD PLUMMET JUST LIKE ANYWAY SAID THEY DID NOT ACCEPT EXCEPT HE SAYS KEEP GOING TO FALL THROUGH THE FLOOR IF WE BELIEVE THE KEY THING THAT THAT THE R.A.F. S. ANALYSIS TERMS UPON IS THE SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY AND IN ON THIS RESPECT IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THAT INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS THAT HAS COME OUT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS
EVERYBODY IS SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE A HIT BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THOSE SERVICES THERE'S A RANGE OF ESTIMATES AND ONES WHO ARE MOST BENEFICIAL TO THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAY WELL IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IF YOU HAVE LOTS OF DEREGULATION AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD WHAT THIS NEW REGULATION IS IT MATERNITY LEAVE IS IT RIGHTS AT WORK OR IF YOU ALLOW GREATER FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE THE ONE THING THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IS DEAD AGAINST SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ASSUMPTIONS YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM WHAT IT IS THAT GIVES THEM THAT WAS A BETTER OUTLOOK IF YOU LIKE TWO THINGS
THEY'VE BEEN NEITHER QUITE HONOURED DON'T REALLY WANT MY MUM IT WAS I THINK THE BASIC ARGUMENT THAT IT'S BRONZE SO MUCH LIKE THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM US WHATEVER YOU ASKED HARD QUESTIONS LIKE ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WOOD OIL REMAINED OVER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A BARREL ALEX SALMOND YOU CECILIA TALKING SCOTLAND ONLY BE SUGGESTS IT FALLS DOWN IT IT TURNS OUT THAT WELL A DEAD RIGHT TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS LET LET LET'S GO FOR A FINAL QUESTION ABOUT LABOUR AND THIS AND THIS DO YOU BELIEVE JEREMY CORBIN IS AS INVOLVED IN THIS DEBATE AS HE SHOULD BE
I THINK HE IS AND I HOPE YOU'LL BE MORE INVOLVED DO YOU I THINK YOU SHOULD BECOME MORE INVOLVED US AS WOULD COME TO THE BAY THE LEADER OF ANY POLITICAL PARTY IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE LEAD THE OPPOSITION HAS A BIG ROLE TO PLAY AND I HOPE THAT HE DOES MORE HOWEVER YOU LOOK AT THAT THIS IS A BROAD BASED CAMPAIGN OF ALL PARTIES PEOPLE NO PARTIES THE KEY THING WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THE FRONT OF OUR MIND IS THAT WE ARE TAKING THIS MASSIVE DECISION THAT IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF RISK IF WE LEAVE
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD TAKE A LEASE OF THE DARK AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WITH A LEAF PROBLEM IF I CAME A LOT ON THE LEFT OF THE LABOUR PARTY IS THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS PLANNING TO DO AND OBVIOUSLY THE FREE TRAILED TRENT DEAL WITH AMERICA SO CALLED T. TIP IS ONE OF THESE THINGS AND HE HAS CAMPAIGNED AGAINST AND OTHERS ON THE LEFT HAVE CAMPAIGNED AGAINST THAT ACTUALLY THOSE THINGS BECOME MORE LIKELY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IF WE STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES THOSE DEALS DID DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THERE IS ON THE LEFT OF THE LABOUR PARTY
GENUINE QUESTION COULD BE ANSWERED BY PEOPLE LIKE YOU ABOUT WHY WE SHOULD STAY ON OR ON THE TRANSATLANTIC DEAL YES THERE IS CONCERN PARTICULARLY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE HEALTH SERVICE WOULD BE EXPOSED TO COMPETITIVE TENDER AND ALL THAT I THINK THAT CAN BE DEALT WITH BECAUSE NOBODY'S GOT ANY APPETITE FOR IT INTERESTING
DAVID CAMERON SAID THE SAME THING I THINK IN THE BROADER ISSUE ABOUT THE TRADE I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT BOTH ON THE LEFT AND ON THE RIGHT BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP ARE SAYING A SIMILAR THING ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARGUE AGAINST TRADE MY FIRM BELIEF IS THAT PROVIDED YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT RIGHT SAFEGUARDS TRADE
HELPS ALL OF US BECAUSE IT HEAD WILL HELP REDUCE WORLD POVERTY WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE WEALTH OF HOUR IS THAT O.K. WE'RE NOT BANKING MORE STRONG AT DICK I'M SURE HE WILL MAKE THESE MADE THE CASE FOR STAYING AND I'M SURE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO DO SO WHAT WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT THE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER OFF THE MORE IT TRADES WITH EACH OTHER AND THEY WERE BETTER OFF IN EVERY SENSE THE MORE WE CAN WE DO WITH EACH OTHER AND TALK TO EACH OTHER
SOME OF THE BIG PROBLEMS FACING THE BETTER IT IS ALL RIGHT I KNOW I'M SO AGAINST PEOPLE HAD THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN SOMEHOW TURN YOUR BACK ON THE REST OF THE WORLD AND SOMEHOW IT DOESN'T MATTER I'VE GOT TO LIVE WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE WIDOWS OF EMERGENCY WORKERS POISONED BY RADIATION AT CHERNOBYL THE MOTHERS OF SOLDIERS KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN JUST SOME OF THE VOICES RECORDED BY THE BELARUSSIAN WRITER FOR LANA L.X. SEEPAGE IN HER ACCOUNTS OF THE LAST DECADES OF THE SOVIET UNION HER BOOKS COLLAR LARGES HAVE TESTIMONY OF ORDINARY PEOPLE CAUGHT UP IN TRAUMATIC EVENTS ONE OF THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE LAST YEAR
IN THE WAKE OF THAT SUCCESS SEVERAL OF HER CLASSIC BOOKS ARE BEING REISSUED HERE WHICH IS A NEW ONE SECOND HAND TIME WHICH CHARTS THE COLLAPSE OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME AND THE RISE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN OUR CORRESPONDENT MIKE THOMPSON HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO HER
THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE
FOR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN YOUTHS AWARDED TWO OF THE BELLA RUSH
SAID LANA A LIXIE
FOR HER A PHONIC WRITINGS A MONUMENT TO SUFFERING AND COURAGE YOU KNOW
SVETLANA ALEX SAY A BITCH THE FIRST NON FICTION WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE SINCE WINSTON CHURCHILL HAS A UNIQUE WRITING STYLE
HER BOOKS WHICH SHE DESCRIBES AS NOVELS INVOICES ARE STRUCTURED AROUND THE TESTIMONY OF HUNDREDS OF ORDINARY PEOPLE THEIR VIEWS RATHER THAN HERS PREDOMINATE
BUT WHEN YOU MADE THE CHILL IF YOU COULDN'T HAVE A FAT THEM VIA KIM I THOUGHT OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WHICH MIGHT BE CALLED THE BARBARIAN CENTURY WITH ALL ITS MURDERS THE HOLOCAUST CHIP NORBERT HAS UNDERMINED OUR TRUST IN FICTION BECAUSE THE REALITY PROVED MUCH MORE UNEXPECTED MUCH MORE HORRIFYING EVEN MORE FANTASTIC THAN FICTION
AND THAT IS WHY A REAL LIFE THE GENUINE EXPERIENCE IS MORE IN DEMAND TODAY MAYBE THIS IS JUST MY POINT
AND COME OUT THE COUNTENANCE THE RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT BROUGHT WERE AN EXTRAORDINARY MORNING OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN MOSCOW
INFORMATION HE SAID THAT THE ENTIRE APEMEN COMMITTEE WOULD YOU DEPOSED EQUIVOCAL BUT THEY'LL CLIMB TO LEAVE MOSCOW
ELIXIR BITCHES LATEST BOOK SECOND HAND TIME BEGINS WITH THE INITIAL EUPHORIA THAT FOLLOWED THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES
THEIR WORLD SHATTERED INTO DOZENS OF COLOURFUL LITTLE PIECE
THIS SAW TERRIBLY EAGER FOR TO CROESOR HE'D EVERY DAY TO TURN INTO AN AMERICAN FEEL
NOT MANY PEOPLE REFLECTED ON HULL WHICH RAN IT IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE
THOSE THREE DAYS MAY HAVE SHAKEN THE WORLD BUT WE REMAINED AND SHAKEN
BUT THE PERESTROIKA PARTY DIDN'T LAST THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY WHAT ALEXIA BITCH DESCRIBES AS GANGSTER CAPITALISM WHILE GOOD LEGS MAY HAVE GONE IN A QUALITY AND INJUSTICE CERTAINLY
SURE YOU CUT I A GIDDY ON THE MOORS WRITTEN AS ARTHUR THEY WILL TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS SPENT THEIR ENTIRE LIFE IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP THERE WE CAN'T JUST OVERNIGHT AND UNDERSTAND WHAT FREEDOM IS AND OF COURSE NOW INPUTS OF TIME
WE ARE THE GENERATION OF PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED AND PERESTROIKA AND BELIEVED IN IT WE FEEL DEFEATED AND NATURALLY THIS FEELING OF DEFEAT IS ALL THE STRONGER BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHEN RUSSIA GETS ANOTHER CHANCE LIKE IT HAD IN THE NIGHT WITH THE MOSS THE GRUB AND PUTIN IS POPULAR ISN'T IT SEEMS THAT THE YOUNG UNDERSTAND ORGY FOR THE GLORY DAYS SO TO SPEAK OF THE U.S.S.R. WHEN YOUS NAZI WOULD
THIS SHOW WITH I HEARD YOUNG PEOPLE BLAMING THEIR PARENTS FOR LOSING THE GREAT COUNTRY YOU'D BE THEY SAY WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE IN A GREAT COUNTRY AND WHEN YOU ASK THEM WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CREATIVE NOBODY MENTIONS OF THE DIGNITY OF WELLBEING OF THE PEOPLE JUST WE WANT EVERYBODY TO BE AFRAID OF US SOCIETY SOMEHOW HAS THAT IN ITS GENE THEREFORE YOU KNOWS HOW TO LIVE IN THESE WARLIKE CONDITIONS THINGS
THAT WAS MIKE THOMPSON REPORTING THE TIME NOW IS A FOURTEEN MINUTES TONIGHT AND THEY CALL THEMSELVES ISLAMIC STATE BUT IS IT POSSIBLE NOW TO FOR SEE A MOMENT WHEN THEY MAY NO LONGER HAVE ENOUGH TERRITORY TO CLAIM TO BE A STATE LET ALONE AN ISLAMIC CALIPHATE I S. IS FACING HIS MAY SUSTAIN GROUND ASSAULT YET FROM IRAQI GROUND FORCES ATTACKING THE CITY OF FALLUJAH MOSEL AND KURDISH LED FORCES MOVING ONTO IT SYRIAN STRONGHOLD OF CRACKER IF I NEED TO IF IT IS A BIG IF OF COURSE THEY LOSE GROUND IN BOTH
THEN FOR SO CALLED I. S. WELL I'M JOINED BY DOCTOR KAREN VON HIPPO IS DIRECTOR OF LUCY AND FORMALLY FROM THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT AND ON THE LINE FROM NOTTINGHAM BY DOCTOR ABSEIL ASHRAF WHO'S THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM CENTRE FOR CONFLICT SECURITY AND TERRORISM DOCTOR VON HIPPO FIRST OF ALL
WE'RE GETTING WAY AHEAD OF OURSELVES BY TALKING A BUYER'S LOSING THAT AMOUNT OF TERRITORY YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEY WILL BE IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW I WAS ON A ROCK OR TOP PROBABLY THE END OF THIS YEAR EARLY NEXT YEAR
IT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TO START THINKING AHEAD ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WHERE MIGHT THE FREIGHTERS GO WHO AREN'T CAPTURED OR KILLED ANOTHER WOULD THEY MAKE GOOD A AND TRY TO SET UP SHOP THERE THEY'RE LIKE THEY DO GO INTO EUROPE AND TRYING TO CAUSE TROUBLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE STILL POWERFUL SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ANTICIPATING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NOW
BUT I THINK WE'RE STILL SOME WAY IS A IT DEFEAT MILITARILY ON THE GROUND AND DOCTOR VON ABLE WHAT SORT OF TIME SCALE DO YOU PUT IN ISN'T THERE A DANGER THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS HOPELESSLY OVER OPTIMISTIC ABOUT SETBACKS DRIER
THAT'S THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT I THINK IT WILL LIKELY BE IN EARLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REGIONAL DYNAMICS GETTING INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED RIGHT NOW WITH THE TURKS
CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT KURDISH DEMANDS FOR INDEPENDENCE WITH INSIDE IRAQ POLITICAL ISSUES
HER BODY'S TRYING TO DEAL WITH TRANTER CORRUPTION VERSUS FOCUSING ON ICE ALSO THERE A LOT OF COMPLETING THE MAN'S RIGHT NOW THAT ARE VERY DISTRACTING DOCTOR ASHRAF WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF THE POSSIBLE TIMES
I THINK THE DEMISE OF ISIS HAS BEEN PREMATURELY FORECAST MY INCLUDE MYSELF IN THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING IT WOULD HAPPEN THE ONLY WAY WILL HAPPEN IS IF THESE THREE SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS TAKE PLACE BECAUSE THERE'S AN INSURGENCY IF YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO AREAS UNDER WHICH IT BECOMES UNDER PRESSURE IT WILL YIELD
AND ATTACK ELSEWHERE SO WHAT WE NEED IS A SUSTAINED AND COORDINATED LEVEL ATTACKS ACROSS A BROAD FRONT AND THEN IT WILL YIELD A GREAT DEAL OF TERRITORY AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE THE SITUATION YOU DESCRIBED NO TERRITORY FOR A STATE THAT CLAIMS TO BE A STATE THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION DOCTOR ASHRAF
THE FORCES ARE ACTUALLY HOLDING BACK OUTSIDE THE CITIES BECAUSE OF COURSE THE GREAT COMPETING REGIONAL POWERS I CAN'T AGREE IF THEY AGREE THEY SHOULD DEFEAT BUT THEY CAN'T AGREE YOU SHOULD TAKE OVER AFTERWARDS THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM HERE AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY THIS CONFLICT HAS BEEN SO PROTRACTED IS THAT ALL POWERS REGIONAL HAND EVEN IF INTERNATIONAL ARE YOU TRYING TO USE THIS THIS SITUATION TOO
FURTHER THEIR OWN AGENDAS AND SO UNLESS THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL COORDINATED RESPONSE THIS GROUP WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OF THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP AND THE LACK OF STRATEGY TO TO HER FIND GAINS IF NOT WHERE IT IS ELSEWHERE DOCTOR VOLUBLE HOW WOULD THE WEST WITH THE WORLD'S REACTION HAVE TO CHANGE IF I S.
NO LONGER IS A STATE SAYING WILL COME TO US WE ARE A CALIPH FATE AND THESE IF YOU LIKE RATHER MORE LIKE ALCAN LEADER A MORE CONVENTIONAL ALTHOUGH VERY DANGEROUS TERRORIST GROUP
THAT'S THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY THE NEXT GENERATION OF EYESORE
THE COLOUR FAKE WASN'T A BAD IDEA THEY JUST DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT AND WE WILL DO IT RIGHT THE NEXT TIME WHEN WE SET UP SHOP SO I'M NOT SURE WE'VE SEEN THE END THESE TERRORIST GROUPS TRYING TO CONTROL TERRITORY BUT I AGREE VERY MUCH WITH PREVIOUS SPEAKER I DO YOU THINK
WE NEED TO HERBERT WORK IN THIS COUNTRY THEY CALL FULL SPECTRUM AFFECTS ANOTHER WAS MAKING SURE THAT WHILE THE MILITARY ACTIVITY IS ONGOING WE'RE ALSO COORDINATING VERY CLOSELY THE MESSAGING THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES NEED TO BE SUING THE BORDERS AT THE SAME TIME
TREASURY FINANCIAL ET-CETERA OTHER OTHER ISSUE I JUST WANNA GIVE DOCTOR VON A BRIEF MOMENT TO ALSO AT HIS DOOR YES I THINK THAT WE DO NEED A COORDINATED OFFENSIVE AGAINST THIS GROUP BUT I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE IS THAT WITHOUT TERRITORY WE SEND OUT A VERY VERY STRONG MESSAGE DIE SHE WILL FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO RECOVER FROM THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WILL HAVE A VERY GOOD ATTEMPT AT REINVENTING THE NARRATIVE BUT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO FAIL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THAT WAS OF COURSE DOCTOR ASHRAF FORGIVE ME AND JOIN US ON THE LINE WHISTLES ADOPTABLE MET THANK YOU
I'M NINE MINUTES TO NINE WE'VE BEEN TALKING THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HIS APPEAL BASED ON PEOPLE'S FEARS IN THE UNITED STATES ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF SEVEN THIRTY JIM ON THE BORDER BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO PROTESTERS OPPOSED TO DONALD TRUMP'S HURLED STONES AND BOTTLES OUTSIDE A RALLY IN NEW MEXICO LAST NIGHT ALBUQUERQUE WHILE HE WAS INTERRUPTED INSIDE WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO ADDRESS IS UNSUPPORTED
THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST
EDWIN WHAT I'M HEARING WE'RE GOING TO GET CLOSE TO FORTY PERCENT OF HIS SUPPORTERS MAYBE THESE PEOPLE I GET A MAN THERE ARE NOW YEAH
LET'S TALK TO KATE ANDREAS FROM THE PUBLICANS OVERSEAS HE'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IT IS A TOXIC ISSUE ISN'T IT AND IT'S A TERRIBLY DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE PLENTY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE KEEN TRUMPS SUPPORTERS GENUINELY THINK DON'T THEY THAT AMERICA HAS A BIG PROBLEM WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
YES THEY DO AND IT'S A REAL SHAME AND AT THAT I THINK THAT'S GOING TO MY HARD ACTUALLY BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE SOLID FACTS IMMIGRANTS EVEN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY THEY ARE GIVING FAR MORE INTO THE WELFARE SYSTEM THEN THEY'RE TAKING OUT AND AS THE AMERICAN POPULATION CONTINUES TO AGE WE NEED YOUNG ABLE WORKING PEOPLE WHY CHANGE THE COUNTRY PAYING THAT OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS NOT MANAGED TO GET THAT ACROSS TO IT SUPPORTED BECAUSE IN AN ELECTION
THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION BECOMES A POLITICAL ONE OUTSIDE OF AN ELECTION PERIOD YOU HAVE PEOPLE CROSS THE PARTY'S COMING TOGETHER TO TRY TO REFORM IMMIGRATION JUST A FEW YEARS BACK WE HAD A BY PARTY THINK MAYBE THERE ARE CALLED THE GANG OF EAT WITH FOUR REPUBLICANS AND FOR DEMOCRATS WHO CREATED A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION BILL AND THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE YOU ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT IMMIGRANT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP IN THE LONG RUN AND THEY WERE GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT EASIER TO GET ALMOST GUILT VISAS
AND BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES COME ELECTION TIME DECIDE TO CRACK DOWN ON THAT BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS GET A LOT OF BENEFIT OUT OF CRACKING DOWN ON IT THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO SAY THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE RACIST THEY DON'T WANNA GO IMMIGRANTS COMING IN AND THEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE WORKING CLASS WHO FEEL LIKE IMMIGRANTS WERE TAKING WHERE THEIR JOBS ARE THOUGH THERE'S NO LONG TERM EVIDENCE
UNLESS THEY HAVE TO BE POLITICAL AS WELL IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT WAS DRIVING TRUMP NOW ACTUALLY I THINK THE I THINK HE MADE IMMIGRATION ARE A KEY PART OF HIS PLATFORM AND HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO KNOW CAN'T PUT THAT AWAY O.K. YOU CAN'T I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO TRY TO BACKTRACK ON HER BECAUSE HE'S GOTTEN SO MUCH MOMENTUM FROM IT NOT JUST FROM REPUBLICANS FROM INDEPENDENCE AND WORKING CLASS DEMOCRATS AS WELL WHAT DOES THAT DO TO YOUR PARTY
WELL I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL BE FOCUSING HEAVILY ON IMMIGRATION WHEN IT SHOULD IN FACT BE FOCUSING MORE ON TRADE AND AND FREE MARKET ECONOMICS
AND THAT'S A REAL SHAME THAT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH TIME AND IT'S HARD TO SEE MANY FRACTIONS OF A REPUBLICAN PARTY COMING BACK TOGETHER BECAUSE REPUBLICANS LIKE ME WHO WHAT DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE WORLD'S POOR AND WANT TO SEE EVERYBODY BECOME MORE PROSPEROUS FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CRACK DOWN ON PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY COMING TO AMERICA
AND MAKING IT MORE PROSPEROUS AND I THINK THAT'S THE REAL THING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE AWAY BUT I'M ALSO VERY FRUSTRATED FROM THE OTHER SIDE FROM THE DEMOCRATS PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MAKING THE EGGNOG THAT I CAN HAVE EGG HE MEANT EITHER THERE OR THEY'RE JUST CRITICISING THE OTHER WILL TURNED THEM ON ANOTHER DAY KATE ANDREAS THANKS SO MUCH THINKING SIX MINUTES TO A NEW SPEAK THE TWO MINUTE HATE
WAR IS PEACE IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH WORDS AND PHRASES THAT INSTANTLY ABOUT GEORGE ORWELL'S GREAT BOOK NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BUT BEFORE THEY APPEARED IN PRINT OR WON'T BREAK THEM DOWN ON A SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER AS PART OF A LIST OF KEY CONCEPTS TO BE AS HE PUT IT
BROUGHT INTO THE NOVEL AND YOU CAN NOW SEE THOSE NODES ALONG WITH THOSE OF DOZENS OF OTHER GREAT WRITERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IN HER NEW ONLINE COLLECTION CREATED BY THE BRITISH LIBRARY HERE TO TELL US MORE ABOUT IT HELEN MELODY LEE CURATOR OF THE CONTEMPORARY ARCHIVE OF THE BRITISH LIBRARY AND JEAN SEATON IS PROFESSOR OF BETA HISTORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTMINSTER AND CHAIR OF THE ORWELL PRIZE JEAN JUST SEEING THOSE MAKE NOTES THERE'S A MAGIC TO IT
AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO LOOK LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING DONE IN SOMEBODY'S OWN HAND IT'S RATHER VIGOROUS HAND HE'S GOT ACTUALLY WE'RE NOT NOT A LITTLE CRABBY HAND IT'S A SORT OF QUICK THE CONFIDENT HAND AND YOU SEE THE MIME
IN ACTION AND WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PAGE IS THAT IT ISN'T NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BUT IT'S GOT ALL OF THE IDEAS OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR IT'S A VERY ORDERLY MIND ACTUALLY AND IT HAS LOTS OF THE THEMES THAT YOU MIGHT GET THAT ARE GOING TO APPEAR INDEED IT DIVIDES INTO TWO PARTS ONE OF WHICH IS AS IT WERE
FEELINGS THE SYSTEM OF ORGANISED LYING BY WHICH IS SOCIETY'S FOUNDED YOU MUST LOOK UP THE NIGHTMARE CAUSED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF OBJECTIVE TRUTH AND THEN THE SECOND PART IS IS HIS IDEAS AND HAS WINDOW BOXES PACIFIST AND SEXUAL CODE
IT'S ALL THERE TO SEE HAD A MELODY YOU MUST HAVE OTHER FAVOURITES TO WHICH OTHER ONES DO YOU YES SO IT JUST TO SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WEBSITE THEY'RE TWENTIETH CENTURY LOOK WENCH TODAY WILL PUT OVER FREE HUNDRED LETTIE TREASURES UNLINED SO THERE'S LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS IN ADDITION TO ORWELL AND WHAT WE REALLY WANTED TO DO WHICH IS QUITE TRICKY IS TO PICK
A SORT OF REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF PEOPLE WHO CAN HIS WORK REALLY ILLUSTRATES THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THAT PERIOD AND IT'S NOT JUST THE NEXT THEY RIGHT BEFORE A BOOK BUT CORRESPONDENTS ISN'T IT STRAUSS REJECTIONS YES WATCH BECAUSE
AS JEAN SAID MILITARY DRAUGHTS ARE WONDERFUL AND THE EVOCATIVE NATURE OF THE ORIGINAL HAND IS EVERYTHING BUT ALSO WHAT WE WANTED TO PROVIDE WAS A CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY WERE CREATED SO WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING FROM WILFRED OWEN AND JAMES JOYCE
VIRGINIA WOOLF OR WELL AUDEN BUT RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT DAY HUGH'S AND BALLARD AND KORESHI AND JEANS DO YOU THINK AS YOU'VE LOOKED AT THIS THAT THIS IS REALLY FAIR UNIVERSITY LEVEL STUDENTS P.H.D. PEOPLE RUNNING A BOOK OR JUST FOR ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED NO IT'S IT'S JUST TERRIBLY EXCITING IF YOU LOOKED AT THE PAGE IT'S GOT ALL THE BITS LOOK AT THE PAGE BY THE WONDERFUL ANGELA CARTER
LIKE AN SAY IN HOW IT IS YOU LEARN TO WRITE SO THERE'S A TYPESCRIPT INCREDIBLY INTERVENED WITH WITH HER HAND IN WHICH YOU SEE HOW SHE CROSSES OUT YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DISTINCTION AND SHE WRITES IN IN HAND ABOVE THE TYPEWRITTEN ONCE UPON A TIME
YOU SEE A GREAT WRITER TRANSLATING THE EVERY DAY INTO THE SORT OF REALM OF THE FAIRY TALE AND IT HITS YOU IN THE HEART AND SO YOU CAN LEARN A LOT ABOUT
IS YOU CREATE AND ALSO THE FAILURE OF CREATING I THINK WE I THINK WE VERY OFTEN IGNORE THAT THE TERRIBLE
THE TERRIBLE DISASTERS THAT WRITERS WILL INDEED HERON THERE IS A LETTER ISN'T THERE FROM T.S. ELIOT T.S. ELIOT FROM THE COAST REALLY OF THE TIME HE'S AGONISING YES SO THIS IS IT THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HAVE A LETTER FROM ELLIOT REJECTING AND GO AWAY BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LETTER
IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES WHEN ELIOT HE'S WRITING TO HIS FRIENDS IN A SHIFT AND HE'S WRITING ABOUT THE WASTE LAND AND HE SAYS YOU COULD NOT HAVE USE WORDS WHICH COULD HAVE GIVEN MORE PLEASURE ALSO PERSUADED ME THAT THE POEM MAY POSSIBLY COMMUNICATE SOMETHING OF WHAT INTENSE HE WAS JUST AS WORRIED AS EVERY OTHER PERSON WHO WRITES I THINK I THINK UNDERSTANDING THAT CREATING HAS FAILURE AND
INSECURITY MOUNTAIN EIGHTY FOUR THIS IS ONE REJECTION LETTER IT NEARLY DIDN'T GET PUBLISHED BECAUSE IT WAS TOO CRITICAL OF THE CONVENTIONAL VIEWS OF POLITICS THIS MET WOULD HAVE MEANT IT WAS THIS MEANT EVERYTHING TO HER WELL SO I THINK
ANYBODY YOU KNOW TEN YEAR OLD COULD GO AND SEE HOW YOU BEGIN TO THINK YEAH BUT ALSO LEARN A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WRITE AND ELLEN YOU'D RECOMMEND THAT WOULD YOU PEOPLE I WOULD I WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND ANYONE LOOKING AT IT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IT SHOWS YOU IT SHOWS IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE TED HUGHES OR WELL OR ELLIOT
IT DOESN'T COME PERFECTLY FORMED YOU HAVE TO WORK OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE IT ALSO SHOW SHE REALLY GREAT MINDS
