THE WEIGHT IS FOR THE OUTCOMES OF THE POLICE INVESTIGATION WHICH IS SEEKING TO ESTABLISH WHETHER ANYONE ACTED CRIMINALLY DURING THE TRAGEDY AND FOR ANOTHER INQUIRY WHICH IS LOOKING INTO THE ALLEGATIONS OF A COVER UP BY OFFICERS AFTER THE MATCH
JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND WILL STAGE ANOTHER FULL WALK UP THIS MORNING THEY'RE WITHDRAWING THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY CARE AS PART OF THEIR INDUSTRIAL ACTION IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT SOPHIE HUTCHINSON IT'S ANOTHER TOUGH DAY FOR THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND WITH HOSPITALS DEPENDENT ON SENIOR DOCTORS FILLING THE GAPS LEFT BY THEIR TRAINEES
YESTERDAY HOSPITAL SAID THEIR CONTINGENCY PLANS HAD WORKED WELL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF JUNIOR DOCTORS WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN WORK DECIDED TO STAY AWAY IN PROTEST OVER THE NEW CONTRACT THEY'RE ANGRY ABOUT CHANGES TO THEIR PAY AND CONDITIONS WHICH THEY SAY ARE UNFAIR AND UNSAFE BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO IMPOSE THEIR NEW CONTRACT ON THEM WHICH IT SAYS WILL MEAN MORE SEVEN DAY N.H.S. AND SAFER CARE FOR PATIENTS
IN THE UNITED STATES DONALD TRUMP HAD SAID HE NOW CONSIDERS HIMSELF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE FOR THE PRESIDENCY HE WAS SPEAKING AFTER WINNING IN ALL FIVE NORTH EASTERN U.S. STATES HOLDING PRIMARY ELECTIONS HILLARY CLINTON WON FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES IN THE SAME STATES ALL HER MAIN RIVAL BERNIE SANDERS BEAT HER IN RHODE ISLAND SHE TOLD HER SUPPORTERS THAT SHE WAS THE CANDIDATE TO DELIVER CHANGE DO YOU MANY PEOPLE FEEL AT THE MERCY OF FORCES TO BEAR
FOR ANYONE TO CONTROL AND THEY JUST WORRIED THAT THOSE OF US IN POLITICS PUT OUR OWN INTERESTS AHEAD OF THE NATIONAL INTEREST
THE FAITH THAT WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER THAT WE CAN GIVE OUR KIDS A BETTER FUTURE THAN WE HAD IS AT THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION
THE TECHNICAL DIRECTOR OF BRITISH CYCLING SHANE SUTTON HAS BEEN SUSPENDED ON AN INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED DISCRIMINATION TAKES PLACE A RIDER JESS VARNISH HAS SAID THAT HE MADE SEXIST REMARKS TO HER HE DENIES WRONGDOING

PHONE OVERALL WERE DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER REVENUE IN THAT PRODUCTS DROPPED BY SIXTEEN CENT THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS MEANS APPLE HAS ENDED THIRTEEN YEARS OF CONTINUOUS COARSELY GRATE
SOME FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTERS AND TORY COUNCILLORS HAVE ATTACKED PLANS ANNOUNCED BY THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE TO CREATE NEW ELECTED MAYORS HE HAS SAID THE MOVE IS PART OF A DEVOLUTION REVOLUTION BUT IN PARLIAMENT TODAY CRITICS WILL QUESTION THE NEED FOR ANOTHER LAYER OF GOVERNMENT

THE PRESSURE'S GROWING ON MINISTERS OVER AIR POLLUTION FIRST THERE WAS THE EMISSIONS TESTING SCANDAL INVOLVING DIESEL CAR MAKERS THEN ILLEGAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE AIR IN MANY CITIES IS JUDGED UNFIT TO BREATHE THE GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONDED WITH PLANS FOR CLEAN AIR ZONES FOR BIRMINGHAM LEEDS NOTTINGHAM DERBY AND SOUTHAMPTON COUNCILS THERE WILL HAVE POWERS TO CHARGE OF VEHICLES TO ENTER CENTRAL AREAS
BUT M.P.S SAY ALL POLLUTED CITIES MUST BE GIVEN POWERS TO TACKLE AIR POLLUTION IN THE WAY THEY THINK FIT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS CITIES EXISTING POWERS ADEQUATE BUT THE COMMITTEE SAYS IF THIS WAS SO THE PROBLEM WOULD'VE BEEN SOLVED ALREADY

PHOTOGRAPH OF THE LETTINGS LANE END AT HILLSBOROUGH WHICH IS IT DESCRIBES AS A DEATH TRAP FAMILIES OF HILLSBOROUGH VICTIMS HAVE HAD TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS NOW IT'S TIME FOR THOSE GUILTY OF CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE AND A COVER UP TO HAVE THEIR EARS AND IT'S
SENSORS PICKED UP ON THE TELEGRAPH FAMILIES CHEER JUSTICES HILLSBOROUGH POLICE FACE PROSECUTION AND OF COURSE THE PICTURES OF THE FAMILIES AND FRIENDS ON THE STEPS AFTER THE INQUEST YESTERDAY SINGING YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE OR ON MANY OF THE FRONT PAGES AS WELL AS INSIDE OF COURSE IT IS OF COURSE THE MAIN STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LIVERPOOL ECHO ANGELS AND DEMONS IS THE HEADLINE IN THE PAPER OVER A PICTURE OF THE CITY HALL
WHICH HAS GOT THE PHRASE TRUTH AND JUSTICE EMBLAZONED ON IT AND ABOVE THE HEADLINE IT SAYS HEROES FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE AND AT LAST A CITY IS VINDICATED NOW THE PRESSURE MOUNTS ON THE COWARDS AND ON THE LIARS THE INSIDE REPORTED YESTERDAY TO DRUGS AT WHAT A DAY WHAT AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT DAY MANY PEOPLE OF COURSE INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THE SUN WOULD COVER THIS STORY STILL BLAMED BY MANY PEOPLE IN LIVERPOOL FOR BLAMING THE FANS FOR WHAT HAPPENED IN HILLSBOROUGH
THE STORY'S NOT ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SUN QUITE A NOTABLE OMISSION YOU'VE TO TURN ALL THE WAY TO PAGE EIGHT OR NINE BUT THEN THERE IS A DOUBLE PAGE SPREAD WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THOSE WHO DIED AND THE HEADLINE JUSTICE TWENTY SEVEN YEARS ON AND THEY'D PAPERS EDITORIAL INDEED HAS THE HEADLINE JUSTICE AT LAST AND REPEATS THE FAT BUT THE PAPER HAS APOLOGISED
ON TWO PREVIOUS OCCASIONS THERE ARE OTHER STORIES IN THE PAPERS OF COURSE THE DAILY MAIL ON ITS FRONT PAGE HAS LABOUR M.P.S ANTI SEMITIC OUTBURSTS ON FACEBOOK THAT STORY FROM YESTERDAY OF NOSE SURE WHO RESIGNED AS AN AID TO THE LABOUR SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL FOR SUGGESTING THAT ISRAEL SHOULD BE MOVED TO THE UNITED STATES THE TIMES AS WELL PAPER THAT DOESN'T PUT HILLSBOROUGH ON ITS FRONT PAGE
HAS THAT LABOUR M.P. STORY AS WELL AND ALSO HAS AN INTERESTING POLL SAYING THAT THE PUBLIC DON'T WANT DOCTORS TO GO FURTHER IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE STILL VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR OF THE JUNIOR DOCTORS BUT IF THEY TOOK FURTHER ACTION INCLUDING MASS RESIGNATIONS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE PUBLIC APPROVAL
JUST A QUICK WORD THAT ALL THE PAPERS PICK UP ON SOME GREAT PICTURES FROM YESTERDAY OF THE MAD WEATHER NEARLY MAIN IT'S SNOWING ALL OVER THE U.K. PEOPLE IN DEVON HAVE SNOW COVERED TREES LONDON TEESIDE YORKSHIRE JUST LIKE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE APPARENTLY THAT WAS LAST TIME THEY WERE BLIZZARDS HER BUT THIS IS PART OF THE YEAR
IT IS NOW TEN PAST SIX THE TRUTH THEN IS NO LONGER IN ANY DOUBT THE WORLD KNOWS WHAT THEY THE RELATIVES OF THE NINETY SIX WHO DIED IN BRITAIN'S WORST EVER SPORTING DISASTER ALWAYS KNEW THOSE WHO DIED THAT DAY AT HILLSBOROUGH
WERE NOT TO BLAME THEY WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED THE MATCH COMMANDER AT THE F.A. CUP SEMI FINAL CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT DAVID DUCK IN FIELD HAS BEEN HELD TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANSLAUGHTER BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE DUE TO A BREACH OF HIS DUTY OF CARE
SPEAKING TO NEWSNIGHT MARCIA WILL STEWART THE SOLICITOR FOR THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES SO THE JURY'S CONCLUSIONS ARE COMPLETELY VINDICATED THE BEREAVED FAMILIES
EVEN AS A LAWYER I'M STUNNED THE FAMILY'S EXPRESSIONS OF JOY AND DELIGHT
SAD MEN
NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE IT IT'S AMAZING
REMARKABLE DAY AND A HISTORIC DAY NOT JUST FOR OUR FAMILIES BUT FOR LIVERPOOL FOR FOOTBALL
THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM WHO CAMPAIGNED FOR THIS REFERRED TO WHAT HE CALLED THE GREATEST MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OF OUR TIMES
THIS COUNTRY ALTHOUGH TWENTY SEVEN YEARS ON HAS IN THE END BEEN ABLE TO WALK ITSELF IN THE MIRROR AND OWN UP TO SOME OF THE THE DARK HIS FAILINGS IN A PERSON THAT IS A POSITIVE BUT THE GREAT BIG POSITIVES FOR THIS CITY OF LIVERPOOL
IN THE AFTERMATH VICTIMISED THE SLURS BUT THEY STOOD TOGETHER THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY THEY UNDERSTAND HERE WHAT SOLIDARITY TRUE SOLIDARITY ME
AND BECAUSE OF THAT SOLIDARITY THIS CITY HAS PREVAILED AND THE CLOUD IN THE END
THE FAMILIES MAY HAVE THE TRUTH OFFICIALLY RECOGNISED BUT MANY SAY THAT THEIR SEARCH FOR JUSTICE STILL CONTINUES AS THEY'RE DEMANDING THAT THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE ARE HELD TO ACCOUNT AN ONGOING POLICE INVESTIGATION IS SEEKING TO ESTABLISH WHETHER ANYONE ACTED CRIMINALLY DURING THE TRAGEDY ANOTHER INQUIRY BY THE I.P.C.C. THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION IS LOOKING INTO THE ALLEGATIONS OF A COVER UP BY OFFICERS AFTER THE MATCH
THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME THIS MORNING WILL BE HEARING FROM THOSE INVOLVED IN THE INQUEST BOTH THEIR RELATIVES ARE VICTIMS OF THE LAWYERS WHO CROSS EXAMINED THOSE WHO GAVE EVIDENCE AND WE'LL HEAR FROM LIVERPOOL WHERE THIS AFTERNOON BELLS WILL TOLL NINETY SIX TIMES AT SIX MINUTES PAST THREE THE MOMENT WHEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THAT MATCH AT HILLSBOROUGH
WAS STOPPED IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX DONALD TRUMP IS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT STEP CLOSER TO SECURING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION HE WON ANOTHER FIVE PRIMARIES LAST NIGHT AND HILLARY CLINTON ALSO DID WELL FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AT THAT NEWS HE SAID THIS
I THINK THE ONLY CARD SHE HAS IS THE WOMAN'S GOING SHE'S GOT NOTHING ELSE GOING AND FRANKLY IF HILLARY CLINTON
I DON'T THINK SHE'D GET FIVE PER CENT OF THE VOTE THE ONLY THING SHE'S GOT GOING IS THE WOMAN'S GUIDE AND THE BEAUTIFUL THING IS WOMEN DON'T LIKE HER OH K. LIC
A LITTLE EARLIER I SPOKE TO OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT SIR HE WAS DESCRIBING HERSELF TONIGHT AS THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE HE LIKENED HIMSELF TO A BOXER WHO JUST KNOCKED OUT HIS OPPONENT AND DIDN'T NEED TO AWAIT THE DECISION FROM THE REFEREE TO FIND OUT WHO'D WON HE BASICALLY DECLARED HIMSELF TO BE THE WINNER BUT HE STILL NEEDS TO WIN SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF THE REMAINING DELEGATES TO SECURE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND HIS RIVALS ARE AIMING TO BLOCK HIS PATH IN UPCOMING CONTEST SUCH AS INDIANA NEXT WEEK THAT REALLY IS BECOMING
DO OR DIE MOMENT FOR THAT STOP TRUMP FORCES THERE IS A COMPLICATION THOUGH SARAH FROM TONIGHT AND IT'S THESE OBSCURE OR RULES IN PENNSYLVANIA ABOUT HOW DELEGATES ARE AWARDED A TRUMP GETS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER JUST FROM WINNING THE STAID
BUT THEY ELECT THEIR DELEGATES IN PENNSYLVANIA IN THE DELEGATES DON'T HAVE TO SAY WHO THEY'RE GOING TO BACK SO IT MAY BE THAT SOME OF THE DELEGATES THAT CAME FROM PENNSYLVANIA AREN'T TRUMP SUPPORTERS AT ALL THEY'LL BACK TECH CREWS WE JUST DON'T KNOW
THAT TAKES A SLIGHT EDGE OF WHAT WAS A VERY BIG NIGHT FOR DONALD TRUMP SO DID HILLARY CLINTON SEAL HER NOMINATION TONIGHT THE OTHER DEMOCRATIC RACES ALL BUT OVER SHE WON FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THE STAKE SHE LOST IN RHODE ISLAND TO BERNIE SANDERS BUT SHE WON THE OTHER FOUR
AND IT IS A LEAD WHICH IS BASICALLY INSURMOUNTABLE
BUT IT'S ANA'S WOULD HAVE TO WIN A LANDSLIDE IN EVERY SINGLE REMAINING CONTEXT HE'D HAVE TO WIN OVER SIXTY PER CENT OF THE VOTE AND THERE'S ONLY ONE STATE HE'S MANAGED TO DO THAT SO FAR AND THAT'S HIS HOME STATE OF THEM AREN'T SO THE DEMOCRATIC RACE IS OVER ESSENTIALLY BERNIE SARDIS HE'S SAID HE'LL CONTINUE ON BUT HE WON'T CATCH HILLARY CLINTON
SHE CAN DESCRIBE HERSELF AS THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE ALTHOUGH SHE HASN'T DONE THAT AND WHAT HER SPEECH TONIGHT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS TRYING TO UNITE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO APPEAL TO THE SUPPORTERS OF BERNIE SANDERS AS MANY OF WHOM ARE VERY CRITICAL OF HILLARY CLINTON AND APPEAL TO THEM TO UNITE AROUND HER CANDIDACY
NICK BRIAN THANKS VERY MUCH
IT'S A QUARTER PAST SIX NOW THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEEN IT SELLS FALL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTEEN YEARS BAD NEWS FOR APPLE ROB YEUNG IS HERE WITH THAT IN THE REST OF MY DAYS YES GOOD MORNING MAKER OF SMARTPHONES TABLETS AND LAPTOPS APPLE HAS SEEN AT SALES FALL FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR APPLE'S REVENUE
DROPPED THIRTEEN PERCENT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR BUT THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY STILL SOLD THIRTY FOUR BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF PRODUCTS IN THE PERIOD INCLUDING FIFTY ONE MILLION I PHONED US FOUR HUNDRED PHONES SOLD EVERY MINUTE WE CAN TALK TO A U.S. TECHNOLOGY REPORTER DAVE LEE HE JOINS US FROM CALIFORNIA MORNING DAVE GOOD MORNING WHAT HAS DRIVEN THIS FALL IN SALES
I GUESS THE MAIN DRIVE IT IS POOR PERFORMANCE IN CHINA FOR A WILD CHINA HAS BEEN PROPPING UP APPLE IN THE SENSE THAT STAGNATING SALES IN DEVELOP MARKETS PARTICULARLY THE U.S. HAVE BEEN KIND OF COVERED BY AMAZING GROWTH IN CHINA THEY'VE BEEN OPENING UP STORES IN THE SELLING I PHONES TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN CHINA THAT'S BEEN MAKING THERE
COARSELY RESULTS AND THE YEAR THE RESULTS LOOK FANTASTIC AND THEY'VE BEEN COMING OUT WITH RECORD PROFITS AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING OUT OF THE PAST YEAR OR SO WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS TIME IS THERE AS APPLE WORN THREE MONTHS AGO BEFORE THESE RESULTS CAME OUT SALES IN CHINA HAVE BEEN SUFFERING THEY'VE GONE DOWN THEY'VE ALSO SUFFERED FROM A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR SO THEY HAVE THE REVENUE AMOUNT HAS GONE DOWN
AND ALSO THE PHONE IS NO LONGER THE BLOCKBUSTER PRODUCTS IT ONCE WAS AND MANY PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THEIR SMARTPHONE ERA THE SMARTPHONE BOOM ERA BEING OVER FOR COMPANIES LIKE APPLE AND LIKE SAMSON AS WELL AND SAY BRIEFLY DAVE AND HAS APPLE GOT A GROUNDBREAKING DEVICE UP ITS SLEEVE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HAS DRIVEN IT INCREDIBLE GROWTH IN RECENT YEARS
YES FOR MANY PEOPLE HOPE THE APPLE WATCH MAYBE THAT NEW CATEGORY THAT NEW GROUND BACON PRODUCT THEY HAVEN'T TOLD US QUITE HOW THAT'S PERFORM JESS BEEN OUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEY HAD NEVER ACTUALLY BROKEN DOWN HOW THAT APPLE WATCH PERFORMING ANALYST TELL US IS MAYBE BRINGING HER IN AROUND ONE BILLION DOLLARS PER QUARTER THAT'S PRETTY GOOD THAT'S A SUCCESS BY ANY OTHER COMPANY STANDARDS BUT BY APPLE STANDARDS THAT STILL MINUTE COMPARED TO WHAT
THEY'D WANT IT PERHAPS BRINGING ESPECIALLY SMALL COMPARED TO WHAT THE I PHONE BRINGS IN AND SO MANY INVESTORS ARE SAYING THEY NEED ANOTHER BIG HIT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW APPLE IS RUN OF STILL RELYING HEAVILY ON THE PHONE AND AS OF TODAY AS OF THE LATEST FINANCE RESULTS WE I PHONE IT'S OFFICIALLY IN DECLINE SO YOU'VE GOT APPLE
THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY OF RELYING ON A PRODUCT THAT IS NOW IN DECLINE SO VERY INTERESTING TIMES FOR THEM THEY NEED ARE NEVER BIG HITS INVESTORS SAY IN ORDER TO TURN THAT AROUND O.K. THANK YOU DAVE I WANT TO BRING OUR MARKETS GUEST THIS MORNING MARCUS STUDLAND AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT LLOYD'S MORNING MARCUS IS THIS A BLIP A DAPPLE OR PERHAPS THE START OF SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS GOOD MORNING ROB IN FAIRNESS THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN SOME MACKEREL HEAD WINS IN CHINA AND IN THE U.S. FOR A APPLE
IT'S CERTAINLY A SLOWER UPGRADE CYCLE TIS TIME AROUND SO WE'VE YOU KNOW WE'VE NOTED THAT AND ALSO THERE'S BEEN SOME I PHONE CHANNEL INMAN TORY REDUCTION GOING ON AND ALL OF THAT HAS LED US TO A LESS POSITIVE NEWS ABOUT APPLE'S REVENUE GROWTH AND PROFITS GROWTH THAN WE HAD EXPECTED
BUT YOU KNOW THE GUIDANCE FOR THE NEXT QUARTER IS NOT AS BAD AS IT WAS FEARED BY SOME AND I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER THEY'RE PROBABLY WENDY I PHONED SEVEN COMES AROUND WE ARE LOOKING ARITZ TOOHEY YEAR GROWTH OF EIGHTY PER CENT OF APPLES INSTALLED BASE WHICH IS PRETTY POSITIVE SO I I WOULDN'T GET TOO PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THAT
OR NEW VERSIONS OF EXISTING PRODUCTS THE WAY THAT APPLE CAN REALLY BOOST ITS GRACE WE'LL SEE ABOUT THE LATEST READ IT SHE HAD TO GO INTO A SLIGHTLY CHEAPER I WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE C. AND THE JURY'S STILL OUT WHETHER THIS WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT WITHIN THE EYE FROM SPACE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INNOVATION LEFT FOR APPLE TO TO BRING TO THE FOREGROUND AND BILL
SO SHOULD INVESTORS IN APPLEBY WORRIED THAT WELL APPLE IS ACTUALLY VERY ATTRACTIVELY VALUE HAS VERY STRONG CASHFLOW GROWTH AND IS ITS VALUATION PRICE CASH FLOW PRICE EARNINGS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY LOW FOR A TECH COMPANY AND THEREFORE WE CAN WE WILL ALSO SEE SOME DAVID IN GROWTH CONTINUING SO I THINK APPALOOSA IS IT IS IT IS A PRETTY GOOD INVESTMENT OBVIOUSLY LONGER TERM
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE WILL BE MORE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION I THINK BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IS THE ECOSYSTEM REVENUE REVENUES FROM MY TUNES AND THE LIKE TO REALLY CATCH UP WITH THE INSTALLED BASE GROWTH WHICH EVENTUALLY WILL HAPPEN BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME SOME TIME TO COME THROUGH OH KAY THANKS BUT DO STAY WITH US MARCUS NOW A GLOBAL ECONOMIC HEADWINDS ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE LATEST FINANCIAL RESULTS AT BARCLAYS
WE'LL GET THEM AT SEVEN O'CLOCK BUT WE ALREADY KNOW FROM BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT INVESTMENT BANKING US HAD A PRETTY DIRE FEW MONTHS AND ON TOP OF THAT BARK EXECUTIVES WILL FACE SHAREHOLDERS AT THE GROUP'S ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING TOMORROW AND THEY'RE FACING CRITICISM OVER THE PAY OF THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE JESS DALEY WILL WITH US IS CHRIS WHEELER BANKING ANALYST AT ATLANTIC EQUITIES MORNING CHRIS GOOD MORNING WHY HIS INVESTMENT BANKING AND HAVING SUCH A TOUGH TIME OF IT
I THINK IT'S SOME OF THE MACKEREL HEADWINDS WE JUST HEALING ABOUT THEM YOU ARE THE GUEST CLEARLY MARKETS HAVE BEEN WEAK IN THE FIRST QUARTER BECAUSE WE SAW A LOT OF WELL IT'S ABOUT CHINA WELL IS ABOUT THE ENERGY PLY SWELL IS ABOUT TO EXIT AND IT MEANT THAT INVESTORS EFFECTS HE WENT WITH WHAT WE CALL THE SCOFF THEY TOOK A MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO THE MARKET BOTH INEQUITIES AND FIXED INCOME
WE SAW A LOT LESS EQUITY ISSUE IT'S NEW EQUITY BEING ISSUED BECAUSE THE EQUITY MARKETS WAS SO WEAK AND ALL THAT COMBINED TO MAKE IT A POLI DIFFICULT QUARTER ONE OF THE WORST I'VE SEEN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE WAY LONG TIME INVESTMENT BANKING DID YOU THINK BARCLAYS OWNERS FERRYING ANY WORSE THAT ITS COMPETITORS I THINK GOING TO BE FEELING AS BADLY AS HIS COMPETITORS AND LIKE ITS COMPETITORS THE INVESTMENT BANKING WEAKNESS WILL OBVIOUSLY IF YOU WANT MITIGATE MUCH BETTER PERFORMANCE IN THE U.K. AND FROM BARCLAYCARD THERE ARE QUESTIONS OVER THE CHIEF EXECUTIVES PAY DO YOU THINK THEY'RE JUSTIFIED
AH INTERESTING QUESTION WHAT'S THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BARCLAYS WORTH HE'S GOT A HECK OF A JOB ON HIS HANDS IT'S A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN JOB BUT IT'S ALL A MASS OF COMPULSION WITH SIMILAR EXECUTIVES IF WE LOOK AT HIS PAY COMPARED TO SEE JAMIE DIAMOND OF J.P. MORGAN OR LORD LENGTH GONE THE SAX IT WAS QUITE PORTLY BUT THE MAN ON THE CLAPHAM ON THE BUS IT LOOKS QUITE A LOT OF MONEY SO I THINK THE NOISE AROUND THIS WON'T GO AWAY RIGHT
PAY RESULTED OTHER BIG COMPANIES IN RECENT WEEKS DO YOU THINK THE BARCLAYS BOARD COULD BE HEADING INTO SOMETHING SIMILAR I DON'T THINK THEY WILL AT THIS STAGE I THINK JUST STAY THE NEW TO THE BANK THE BANK IS GOING THROUGH AGAIN QUITE A LOT OF CHANGE AND I THINK JESS IS THE RECORD I KNEW HIM FROM FOLLOWING J.P. MORGAN IS SUCH THAT THEY WILL FEEL THEY WANT HIM TO SEE IF HE CAN SEE A STEEL AND FLEW THIS MIX OF HAVING AN INVESTMENT BANK NEXT TO A VILLAGE BIG RETAIL AND CREDIT CARD BUSINESS OUR FORMER BARCLAY'S BOSS BOB DIAMOND IS CONSIDERING BUYING THE PARTS OF BARCLAYS AFRICAN BUSINESS THAT THEY'RE TRYING
TO OFFLOAD WHAT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT WHY WOULD HE WANT TO BUY SOMETHING AT HIS OLD COMPANY DOESN'T THINK IT'S WORTH HOLDING ONTO HONEST BEST FIRST WE'VE GOT TO CLOSE THE TECHNICAL ASPECT WHAT BARCLAYS PARTLY WHAT BARCLAYS ARE SELLING BECAUSE THEY THEY ONLY AND SIXTY PER CENT OF THE BANK AND THEY HAVE TO KIND OF IF YOU WANT CONSOLIDATE THE WHOLE OF THE BANK BIG CAPITAL HEADWIND FOR THEM
IN TERMS OF AFRICA BARCLAYS GOT OUT IN EIGHTY SIX A JOHN PART TIME IT WENT BACK IN IN A BIG WAY TWO THOUSAND FIVE I THINK INVESTORS WILL BE ASKING THE QUESTION OH KAY WE SEE WHY YOU'RE GETTING OUT AND A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE BUT IS THIS A LONGTERM STORY THAT YOU SHOULD PERHAPS BE STICKING WITH RATHER THAN JUST SAYING LET'S GET OUT OF IT SO WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS O.K.
THANK YOU CHRIS CHRIS GOING TO THERE FROM ATLANTIC EQUITY MARCUS ADAM AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE AT LLOYD'S IS STILL WITH US I'M SURE YOU'RE MUCH TOO NICE TO LAY INTO HER RIVAL BANKS ASK THE BROADER QUESTION WHAT IS GOING ON THAT IS PUTTING SO MUCH PRESSURE ON BANKS IS IT ALL DOWN TO THEIR RATHER TROUBLED INVESTMENT DIVISION
THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS GOING ON ONE IS AND I WAS HE ADDS TO THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER THAT THERE'S A TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION GOING ON IN CYBER SECURITY THERE'S DIGITAL WRIST DISRUPTION TO SOME EXTENT AND WE ARE AT THE START OF A OF A BLOCK CHAINED REVOLUTION DIS IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT BASICALLY ENABLES DATA SHARING ACROSS A NETWORK LIKE BUT HE WENT YES EXACTLY
AND I THINK BLACK BLOCK CHAIN CAN ENHANCE SECURITY THROUGH MORE GRANULAR ENCRYPTION AND CAN HELP REDUCE COSTS AND TRANSACTIONS CAN BE MONITORED REAL TIME SO THIS IS RELATIVELY EXCITING THERE'S GENERALLY A SIMPLIFICATION TREND IN SIMPLIFYING BANK BUSINESS MODELS TO GAIN THAT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND THINGS AND BANKING A BIT OR BEING SHAKEN UP
WELL I WOULD SAY IT'S A TRANSITION IT'S NOW A SMOOTH TRANSITION AND THERE'S SOME MORE WORK TO DO FOR SOME COMPETITORS THANK YOU MARCUS FROM LLOYD'S WELL AT CHINA'S ECONOMIC RISE HAS VASTLY IMPROVED THEIR LIVELIHOODS IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF PEOPLE ACROSS A HUGE PART OF ASIA BUT THERE ARE FEARS THAT GROWTH IN ASIA'S DEVELOPING ECONOMIES IS ABOUT TO STALL THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKS HAS THAT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS THE REST OF ASIA WILL VERY MUCH FIELD EFFECTS OF THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN
IN CHINA SHANG GIN WAY IS THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKS CHIEF ECONOMIST AND IS WITH US THIS MORNING MORNING GENT MONEY SO YOU LEND MONEY TO COUNTRIES TO HELP THEM BUILD BIG PROJECTS LIKE MOTORWAYS AND RAILWAYS IN THE LIKE WHICH COUNTRIES DO YOU THINK ARE MOST IN NEED OF HELP
WHILE THE COUNTRY'S BEEN MANY COUNTRIES NEED HELP OF DIFFERENT KIND COUNTRIES
THIS GENERAL SHORTAGE OF INFRASTRUCTURE POWER GENERATION IN TRANCE MACHINE TRANSPORT I C. T. AND SO ON SO WE WORKING THERE WAS COUNTRIES DIPPING YOUR COUNTRY'S NEED AND IF CHINA'S ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IS SET TO CONTINUE AS MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT WHICH COUNTRIES IN DEVELOPING ASIA DO YOU EXPECT TO BE HIT THE HARDEST
COUNTRIES THAT PRODUCE THOSE COMMODITIES OR CHINA BUYS A LOT TEND TO SUFFER BOTH FROM LOWER PRICES ARE IN LOWER VOLUME ALSO COUNTRY'S INTEGRATED WHIZZ CHINA THROUGH A GLOBAL VILLAGE
FOR EXAMPLE COULD SUFFER TEMPORARY AND DIE EVENTUALLY CAMANACHD MANAGE RELOCATING PRODUCTION ELSEWHERE SO
TWO TYPES COUNTRIES PROBABLY OR SUFFER FOR COUNTRIES INPUT AT THE POINT THAT THEY CAN BENEFIT
THE TRANSFORMATION GOING UP IN CHINA'S BANGLADESH VIETNAM AND SO ON FOR THE GAMMON EGG EXPORTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AS CHINA IS RETREATING FROM EXPORTS THESE COUNTRIES CAN EXPECT INCREASE FICKLE MARKET SHEARS SO IT'S NOT ALL COUNTRIES IT'S A THEORY THERE WILL BE AFFECTED NEGATIVELY RIGHT TO THERE ARE UPSIDES FOR SOME COUNTRIES WHO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WILL WILL TAKE WORK THAT CHINA WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE GOT
WINNING INDEED AND WHAT WILL THIS MEAN THEN FALL FOR ECONOMIES RELIANCE ON CHINA AS THE GROWTH ENGINE IN ASIA
YOU DID THERE WILL BE A LOT OF RECONFIGURATION GLOBAL GLOBAL PRODUCTION PETAIN'S COUNTRY WAS CHEAPER LABOUR PROBABLY CAME TO BED
TOYS THEY ALSO COUNTRY BY THE WAY THEY CAN ALSO BENEFIT FROM CHINA'S TRANSITION TO A MORE CONSUMPTION BASED SO YOU KNOW WE SEE MALDIVES AND PAROLE AND SO UNDER BECAUSE THE INCREASED NUMBER OF CHINESE TOURISTS COMING TO AN END
COUNTRIES AND WILLING TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY WE SEE AUSTRALIA'S UNIVERSITIES IN FOR UNIVERSITY SETTLING BED AT THE COSTLY CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY CHILD YOU'RE HIRED HE WAS IMMACULATE EDUCATION SO AS IT'S TOO FEW PEANN CHINESE PARENTS O.K. THANK YOU CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE ASIA DEVELOPMENT

CONSERVATIVE M.P.S AND COUNCILLORS HAVE CRITICISED MINISTER'S PLANS FOR NEW ELECTED MAYORS IN THREE RURAL PARTS OF ENGLAND THEY'VE TOLD THIS PROGRAMME IT WOULD ADD AN EXTRA EXPENSIVE TIER OF GOVERNMENT DOWNING STREET SAID IT WAS EMPOWERING LOCAL AREAS BY DEVOLVING POWERS AWAY FROM WHITEHALL
M.P.S SAY FASTER ACTIONS REQUIRED TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IN TOWNS AND CITIES IT'S ESTIMATED THAT AIR POLLUTION IS PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DEATHS A YEAR THE ENVIRONMENT FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SAYS SO CALLED CLEAN AIR ZONES SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO MORE CITIES IN ENGLAND THANK YOU NIALL IT'S NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AT LAST A CITY IS VINDICATED NOW THE PRESSURE MOUNTS ON THE COWARDS
AND THE LIARS SO IT WAS THE HEADLINE ON TODAY'S LIVERPOOL ECHO PETER HUNT OUR CORRESPONDENT IS IN THE CITY THIS MORNING PETER DOES THAT SUM UP THE MOOD IN THE CITY A SENSE THAT THE TRUTH IS OUT OF THE SEARCH FOR JUSTICE IS NOT OVER YET
YES I THINK VERY MUCH SO THERE WAS THAT DEEP SENSE OF INJUSTICE HERE I THINK THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF VINDICATION THIS MORNING THAT MEMBERS OF THE CITY THE PEOPLE FROM THIS CITY TOOK ON THE ESTABLISHMENT THE ESTABLISHMENT LOST AND THEY WON BUT IT IS NOT AS YOU SUGGEST THE END AND SO NOW IN THE CITY AND ELSEWHERE THERE IS A FOCUS ON THESE TWO OUTSTANDING INVESTIGATIONS WHICH OBVIOUSLY THE RELATIVES HOPE WILL DELIVER WHAT THEY CALL ACCOUNTABILITY WHAT ARE THE LEGAL HURDLES THEY WILL HAVE TO CROSS IF THEY ARE TO GET WHAT THEY THINK IS JUSTICE
THERE ARE THESE TWO INVESTIGATIONS AS I SAY ONE IS A POLICE INVESTIGATION THAT IS LOOKING AS TO WHETHER ANYONE ACTED CRIMINALLY ON THAT DAY I SOUGHT A MANSLAUGHTER INVESTIGATION AT A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW FROM THE INQUEST THAT DAVID DUCK NESFIELD THE MATCH COMMANDER HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED UNDER CRIMINAL CAUTION OTHER PEOPLE THE NUMBERS AND THE PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN MADE PUBLIC HAVE SIMPLY BEEN INTERVIEWED UNDER POLICE
CAUTION SO THAT IS LOOKING AT THAT ASPECT BUT MATCH ITSELF AND THEN THERE'S A SECOND INVESTIGATION BY THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION ONE OF THE LARGEST IF NOT THE LARGEST ONE THAT IT HAS EVER CONDUCTED THEY SAY THAT THERE IS NOW A REALLY SENSITIVE STAGE AND IN ESSENCE THAT'S LOOKING AT WHAT PEOPLE HAVE CALLED THE COVER UP FOR EXAMPLE THEY'VE LOOKED AT SOME FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED POLICE NOTEBOOKS WHICH THEY HAD TO GATHER FROM VARIOUS PLACES
AND THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT A RANGE OF CHARGES WHETHER THERE'S ANYONE GUILTY PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE BY CHANGING POLICE STATEMENTS WHETHER OFFICERS COMMITTED PERJURY WHILE THEY GAVE EVIDENCE ON OATH WHERE THEY PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE BY MISLEADING JOURNALISTS AND THE ISSUE OF MISCONDUCT IN PUBLIC OFFICE BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD BE TO THEIR BEFORE THAT OF COURSE THE CITY WILL PAUSE TO REMEMBER AGAIN
YES I MEAN AT THREE OH SIX THIS AFTERNOON THE TIME WHEN THE MATCH STOP BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BELLS WILL TOLD NINETY SIX TIMES IN LIVERPOOL AND THEN THIS EVENING THERE WILL BE A SERVICE AT SAINT GEORGE'S HALL IT'S WHERE THE BANNERS ARE WHICH READ TRUTH AND JUSTICE TO BE NINETY SIX CANDLES LIT THERE AND HE'LL BE A COMMEMORATION EVENT IS WHAT THE ORGANISER SEA AND THERE'LL BE SPEECHES AND TRIBUTES AND MUSIC REFLECTING ON THE NINETY SIX FANS WHO DIED PETER UNDER LIVERPOOL THANK YOU
IT'S NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO MAKE URGENT CHANGES TO DEAL WITH AIR POLLUTION AND TO STOP FORTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING EARLY EVERY YEAR OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER HARRER BEN JOINS US AND ROGER THIS IS ACCORDING TO A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S THAT'S RIGHT IT IS INTERESTING THAT AIR POLLUTION HAS BEEN A CINDERELLA ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS COMMITTEE NOW THEY WERE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE IS SAYING THAT IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY
I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS DRIVING THIS ONE IS OUTRAGE AMONGST THE PUBLIC AT THE CHEATING HAVE THE TEST BY THE CAR MANUFACTURERS ON EMISSIONS AND ANOTHER ONE IS A COURT CASE UNDER EUROPEAN LAW FROM A GROUP OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYERS WHO SAID THE GOVERNMENT WEREN'T DOING ENOUGH TO PROTECT PEOPLE THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED TO THAT BY INTRODUCING MEASURES IN SIX CITIES BUT THE LAWYERS SAID IT WASN'T ENOUGH THEY'VE TAKEN THE GOVERNMENT BACK TO COURT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A NEW VERDICT ON THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS
AND THE COMMITTEE SAYS THE PROBLEM IS VERY MUCH SUPPORTING THAT THE LAWYERS THE COMMITTEE TODAY SAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE AN OVERARCHING STRATEGY ON THIS IT'S ALL PEACE AND THEY SAY THE GOVERNMENT REALLY NEEDS TO RETHINK ON IT AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE SIXTY CITIES THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE SIX CITIES WHERE CLEAN AIR ZONES ARE ALLOWED THERE SAYING THAT SHOULD THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING FAR MORE RADICAL THAN THAT YES I MEAN OUT OF FORTY THREE AREAS IN THE U.K. THIRTY EIGHT OF THEM ARE IN BREACH OF EMISSIONS
M.P.S ARE SAYING THAT WE NEED MORE POWER TO COUNCILS THERE'S THERE'S A LIST OF THINGS THEY THINK COUNCILS NEED POWER OVER TO HIM INTRODUCE CLEAN AIR ZONES ARE CARS LORRIES BUSES TAXIS AND INTERESTING SHAPES WHICH WE WE RARELY TALK ABOUT THEY ALSO WANT TO SCRAPPAGE SCHEME FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO INCENTIVISE PEOPLE TO SCRAP OLD DIESEL CARS AND ALSO INTERESTINGLY THEY WANT SOME ACTION FROM FARMERS BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE REDUCTION IN THE PAST DECADE IN EMISSIONS FROM FARMERS FROM AMMONIA FROM
STINKING HEAPS OF MANURE I SHOULD SAY ON THAT FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW DEAF SAY THEY THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH POWERS TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES ALREADY AND JUST READING BEHIND LINES OF THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT I THINK THEY THINK IT'S NOT ALL DEAF WAS FAULT THE THING OTHER MINISTERS ARE TO BLAME TOO AND THEY THEY PARTICULARLY MENTION I JUST MENTION THIS IS QUITE INTRIGUING THE MINISTERIAL CLEAN GROWTH GROUP CHAIRED BY OLIVER LETWIN THEY SAY IT HAS NO MINUTES AND NO DIAL IT'S TOO SECRETIVE AND THEY WANTED TO GET A GRIP
ROGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN TODAY FOR THE SECOND DAY IN A ROW JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND WILL STRIKE AND THEY'LL REFUSED TO PROVIDE EVEN EMERGENCY CARE OUR CORRESPONDENT CATRIONA RENTON IS OUTSIDE SAINT THOMAS'S HOSPITAL IN LONDON MORNING TO YOU KATRINA ARE WE EXPECTING VERY MUCH A REPEAT OF YESTERDAY I GUESS THE AUTHORITIES ARE VERY MUCH HOPING IT WILL BE REPEATING THIS SENSE THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS A STRAIN ON THE N.H.S. HE DID SEEM TO COPE
MORNING WE'RE STANDING HERE OUTSIDE SAINT THOMAS'S HOSPITAL ON WESTMINSTER DREDGERS AS WHERE THE PICKET LINE WAS YESTERDAY AND WE'RE EXPECTING JUNIOR WALK DOCTOR
TO WALK IN JUST UNDER AN HOUR AND A HALF TIME FROM EIGHT O'CLOCK NO LIKE YESTERDAY THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE WE THINK THOSE WORKING IN AND E. MATERNITY
INTENSIVE CARE OF COURSE ASSIST ME IS ABOUT
CONTRACTS WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO IMPOSE JUNIOR DOCTORS SAYING THAT THAT WILL BRING IN CHANGES TO THEIR PAY CONDITIONS AND FEAR AND UNSAFE THE GOVERNMENT SEEING THE CONTRACT
ANY WOULD BE MORE FUN
SEVENTY WORKING AND SAFER FOR HER PATIENTS IT'S ESTIMATED THAT YESTERDAY SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF JUNIOR DOCTORS
IN ENGLAND THAT'S MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE AT WORK I DECIDED TO STAY AWAY AND ABOUT TWENTY TWO PERCENT THEREFORE DID CROSSED THE PICKET LINE HOWEVER THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SAYS ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT
WE SEEM TO HAVE LOST KATRINA AT SAINT THOMAS'S HOSPITAL BUT THE MESSAGE CLEAR WHICH IS ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF DOCTORS WERE YESTERDAY THE HOPE SORRY CHOSE TO STRIKE YESTERDAY THOUGH THERE BE AMAZED THAT SIMILAR NUMBERS WELL I KNOW BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS THAT THE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO COPE
IT'S TWENTY MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND BEGIN WITH THE STAR WHICH IS THE LOCAL PAPER IN SHEFFIELD THEIR FRONT PAGE IS BLACK AND THE HEADLINE SHEFFIELD IN THE DOCK THE ONLY IMAGES ARE BADGERS HAVE THE POLICE AMBULANCE SERVICE COUNCIL AND SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB THE PAPER CARRY SEVEN PAGES OF HILLSBOROUGH NEWS PLUS A SIXTEEN PAGE SUPPLEMENT
ONE OF THE HEADLINES SHEFFIELD A CITY UNDER INVESTIGATION BUT THE STAR ALSO HIGHLIGHTS HOW LOCAL PEOPLE HELPED LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS AFTER THE DISASTER FAMILIES OPENED THEIR DOORS ALLOWING FANS TO PHONE HOME OR STAY IN SPARE ROOM SOME FAMILY SAYS THE PAPER REMAIN IN TOUCH IN LIVERPOOL THE MAIN HEADLINE IN THE ECHO READS ANGELS AND DEMONS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY VILLAINS IN THIS STORY ARE MANY HEROES SAYS THE PAPER ABOVE ALL HEROES SIT THE FAMILIES THEMSELVES WHAT THE INSTITUTIONS FAILED TO RECOGNISE IS THAT THEY WERE NOT DEALING WITH ORDINARY PEOPLE
AND THAT LIVERPOOL IS NOT AN ORDINARY CITY INSIDE THE PAPER'S MAIN STORY BEGINS WHAT A DAY WHAT AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT DAY FOR THE HILLSBOROUGH FAMILIES AND CAMPAIGNERS FOR LIVERPOOL AND FOR MERSEYSIDE
THE DAILY MIRROR'S FRONT PAGE CARRIES A PICTURE OF THE ENTRANCE TO THE LAPPING ZE LANE TERRACE AT HILLSBOROUGH THEIR HEADLINE FAMILIES OF HILLSBOROUGH VICTIMS HAVE HAD TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS NOW IT'S TIME FOR THOSE GUILTY OF CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE IN A COVER UP TO HAVE THEIRS
THEME IS CONTINUED BY THE DAILY MAIL THEY'VE DOESN'T LEAD WITH THE STORY BUT THERE PAGE SIX HEADLINE READS PUT THE LYING HILLSBOROUGH POLICE ON TRIAL FAMILIES DEMAND THE MALE'S COLUMNIST PETER OBORNE WRITES ABOUT HOW THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER DESTROYED HIS FAITH IN THE POLICE ASHAMED AS I AM TO SAY IT I BELIEVE THE POLICE HE RIDES AND NOT THE GREAT CITY OF LIVERPOOL I'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP TO SUPPORT THE POLICE IT WAS UNTHINKABLE THAT SHOULD LIE CHEAT AND FABRICATE EVIDENCE WE NOW KNOW THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SOME OF OUR POLICEMEN DID
IN THE MIRROR THE LABOUR M.P.S ANDY BURNHAM AND STEVE ROTHERHAM WHO LED THE CAMPAIGN TO GET JUSTICE FOR THE HILLS FOR A NINETY SIX RIGHT WE DON'T BLAME ORDINARY POLICE OFFICERS WE KNOW MANY DID THEIR BEST BUT WE BELIEVE THEY'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY LET DOWN BY THE LEADERSHIP OF THEIR FORCE NOT ALL PAPERS LEAD ON THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST THERE DEB TELEGRAPH CARRIES A WARNING FROM THE U.S. DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JAMES CLAPPER HE SAYS ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS MAY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF EUROPE'S OPEN BORDERS TO SPREAD ACROSS THE CONTINENT
THE MALE LEADS ON SHAH THE LABOUR M.P. WHOSE APOLOGISE FOR JESS FOR SUGGESTING ISRAEL SHOULD BE RELOCATED TO THE UNITED STATES SHE MADE THE COMMENTS BEFORE SHE WAS ELECTED AS M.P. FOR BRADFORD WEST NOW ARE ALSO APPEARS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES BUT THE PAPER'S MAIN STORY CLAIMS THAT SIR PHILIP GREEN'S KNIGHTHOOD IS AT RISK BECAUSE OF HIS ROLE IN THE COLLAPSE OF B.H.S.
FINALLY THE SUN SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER IS USING AN ENCRYPTED TEXT MESSAGE GROUP TO KEEP SECRET THE GOVERNMENT'S TACTICS IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE PAPER CLAIMS MINISTERS USE OF THE WHAT'S THAT GROUP IS BEING DONE IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAWS
IT'S NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN ARMY NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT VICTIMS OF THE HILBERT DISASTER TO BE REMEMBERED AT EVENTS IN LIVERPOOL TODAY IS THEIR FAMILIES AND POLITICIANS CALL FOR SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY MADE HER FIRST BIG SPEECH ABOUT THE E.U. SINCE THE START OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN ON MONDAY SHE SUGGESTED THE U.K. SHOULD WITHDRAW
FROM THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT IT ALL MEANT HE'S EN CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN
WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ON THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS A LIB DEM FORMER CABINET MINISTER ALISTAIR CARMICHAEL THINKS THERE ARE THREE POSSIBLE ANSWERS THE HOME SECRETARY TELLS US THAT APPARENTLY SHE WANTS TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT LEAVE THE CONVENTION
THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER SIX FOOT THAT'S THE JUSTICE MINISTER DOMINIK RAB WANTS TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT REMAIN IN THE CONVENTION THE LORD CHANCELLOR
MICHAEL GAVE TO YOU AND ME WANTS TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION STAY IN THE CONVENTION BUT IGNORED THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE COURT THANK GOODNESS WE DON'T HAVE THE INSTABILITY OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT
ALISTAIR CARMICHAEL WANTED TO ASK THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY AND URGENT QUESTION IN THE WAKE OF HER BIG SPEECH BUT MISSUS MAY DIDN'T APPEAR IN THE COMMONS WHICH GAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL JEREMY RIGHT A RARE CHANCE TO BASK IN THE PARLIAMENTARY LIMELIGHT THE UNITED KINGDOM IS A FOUNDER MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS
LAWYERS FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DRAFTING OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION WE ARE SIGNATORIES TO THE CONVENTION AND WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR THROUGHOUT THAT WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO THE TEXT OF THE CONVENTION IT IS INDEED A FINE DOC
BUT HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT WAS RULING NOTHING OUT AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO REWRITE THE HUMAN RIGHTS LAWS TO CREATE A BRITISH BILL OF RIGHTS WHY WE WANT TO REMAIN PART OF THE C. H. R. WE WILL NOT STAY IN AT ANY COST
WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR THAT IF WE CANNOT ACHIEVE A SATISFACTORY SETTLEMENT WITHIN THE E.C. H. R. WE MAY HAVE NO OPTION BUT TO CONSIDER WITHDRAWAL
LIKE MANY A DISAPPOINTED THEATRE GOER ALISTAIR CARMICHAEL ADMIRED THE WORK OF THE UNDERSTUDY BUT POINTED OUT THAT HE'D COME TO SEE THE STARS
THE HOME SIXTY WAS THE ONE WHO COULD MAKE THE SPEECH YES SHE CAN WE COME THE COMMONLY FOR STATEMENT TOMORROW SHE SHOULD BE HERE TODAY
YES THERE'LL BE SHE WENT ROAR COULD TO DO SHE'S GONE MISSING BUT A CONSERVATIVE A MAIN WASN'T SURPRISED EVERYONE COME IN LIFE I FIND WHEN YOU THROW A GRENADE YOU USUALLY RETREAT FOR COVER
AND SHE WONDERED IF THE HOME SECRETARY HAD DISCUSSED HER VIEWS BEFORE MAKING THE SPEECH BECAUSE BRINGING THEM UP NOW HAS PUT THAT LOOK AS IF I'LL GOVERNMENT IS IN DISARRAY OVER THIS MATTER THIS IS
LABOUR'S SHADOW JUSTICE MINISTER ANDY SLAUGHTER SAID AT LEAST THE GOVERNMENT WAS OFFERING A CHOICE OF POLICIES ON HUMAN RIGHTS THE HOME SECRETARY WAS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WE SHOULD LEAVE THE E. C. H. R. WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM SO WHAT STATUS TO THE HOME SECRETARY'S REMARK
ARE THEY GOVERNMENT POLICY DO THEY BIND THE M.O.D. AND THE GOVERNMENT OR IS IT JUST THE HOME OFFICE THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE CONVICT
FOR THE S.N.P. JOANNA CHERRY SAID THEN SECRETARY SPEECH HAD CAUSED GRAVE CONCERN IN SCOTLAND THERE IS NO QUESTION THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT EVER GIVING ITS CONSENT TO BRITAIN WAS DRAWN FROM THE EAST
DOES THE HOME SECRETARY NOT REALISE IF BRITAIN MUCH OF HIS ATTEMPT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE E.C. APE SHAH IT WOULD CAUSE A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS WITH THE NEWS
THE SPEECH CERTAINLY MADE WAVES AT WESTMINSTER BUT JEREMY RIGHT THOUGHT EVERYONE SHOULD CALM DOWN I THINK THERE IS A RISK IN THIS DISCUSSION THAT WE MAKE A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AN INDEPENDENT M.P. FROM NORTHERN IRELAND SYLVIA HERMON SAID SHE'D BEEN HORRIFIED TO HEAR THE HOME SECRETARY SUGGEST THAT THE U.K. COULD LEAVE THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AFTER THIRTY
PLUS YEARS OF APPALLING VIOLENCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE BELFAST AGREEMENT SIMON GOOD FRIDAY WAS HARD WON
HARD NEGOTIATIONS ON THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THAT
JEREMY RIGHT INSISTED THERESA MAY WAS AWARE OF WHAT HE CALLED THOSE COMPLEXITIES BUT A CONSERVATIVE PHILIP DAVIS THOUGHT THE U.K. SHOULD LEAVE THE CONVENTION
IN THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS WE HAVE PSEUDO GEORGIA'S MANY OF THEM POLITICAL APPOINTEES RATHER THAN PROPER GEORGIA'S OVERREACHING THEIR REMIT UNDER THE CONVENTION WITH A RIDICULOUS DECISION SUCH AS VOTES FOR PRISONERS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID HE WISHED MY DAVIS WOULD SIMPLY SAY WHAT HE REALLY THOUGHT
JIM SHANNON HAVE THE D. U. P. THOUGHT THE HOME SECRETARY HAD UNDERMINED THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IN THE FURTHER CAP I THOUGHT THEY'RE NOT SO SURE WE SHOULD FROM ME AND KELL
WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE THIRD WAY
REPORTING THERE AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT ON THE LONG WAVE AND DIGITAL RADIO JUST AFTER HALF PER STATE IT'S TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW HEAD OF THE RIO OLYMPICS WHO ARE TEAM G.B.'S BEST HOPES FOR WINNING GOLD EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD AMBER HILL FROM BOXER WON THE B.B.C. YOUNG SPORTS PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN AND SHE SINCE WON A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIONS IN THE SKEET
THAT AS YOU ALMOST CERTAINLY DON'T NO I CERTAINLY DIDN'T IS THE EVENT WHERE YOU FIRE A SHOTGUN AT FLYING CLAY TARGETS LAUNCHED IN QUICK SUCCESSION WELL I'LL ROB BONNET HAS BEEN TO MEET HER AND HER GRANDAD
MEET AMBER HE'LL LAND GRANDFATHER BILL ROGERS ON THE SHOOTING RANGE NEAR HIGH WYCOMBE AMBER PREVIOUSLY PLANNING TO BE A BEAUTICIAN UNTIL SHE DISCOVERED HER TALENT FOR SHOOTING BILL WELL A SHOOTER HIMSELF BUT NOW THE MAN WITH A SUPPORT ADVICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT ACROSS THE GENERATIONS THEY MAKE QUITE A TEAM
I STARTED SHOOTING WHEN I WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD WITH MY GRANDDAD I WAS ALWAYS REALLY SCORED TO THE KIDS I JUST WANTED TO TRY AS MANY SPORTS I COULD WEAR MY GRAN AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
WENT DOWN WITH HIM AND HIT A FEW TARGETS AT MY LOCAL GROUND AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT WHAT DID YOU SEE IN HER WHEN YOU INTRODUCED HER TO THE SPORT SHE HAD POTENTIAL STRAIGHTAWAY ISSUES AND SEEM TO BE AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS ARE NATURAL TO THE STREET OF THE PICKWICK
AND SHE WAS VERY VERY GOOD SHE HAD A GOOD OI AND SHE LISTENED TO GET A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL TO LISTEN IS HOGGLE HIM BUT SHE DOESN'T LISTEN TO WHAT'S BEEN SAID WHEN I TOOK MY FIRST SHOT I'VE GOT A MASSIVE BUZZ
THE ADRENALINE GOT PUMP IN HOURS LIED YOU SHOOT A GUN AND YOU HIT THAT TARGET AND IT JUST EXPLODES AND ALMOST LIKE A FIREWORK YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE ACHIEVED SOMETHING SENSE OF POWER IN HOLDING A GUN AND SHATTERING HER TARGET
I GUESS SO I THINK IT'S THE FACT THAT SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT LEAVE BEEN ABLE TO HIT THE TARGET WHICH IS FLYING ACROSS THE AIR
SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNIQUE TO SORT YOUR NORMAL SPORTS LIKE HOCKEY AND NETBALL I'M NOT QUITE SURE IT WAS BUT I JUST WANT TO SEE HOW FAR I COULD GET IN THE SPORT THAT'S WHY DECIDE TO CARRY ON AND SEE HOW FAR IT WOULD TAKE ME PSYCHOLOGICALLY HOW WELL IS SHE SHE'S VERY GOOD ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE OF IT AND IT IS IT ON THE DAY IN THE BRAIN
IF YOU KEEP IT ON THE DAY AND GET EVERYTHING PERFECT YOU'LL HAVE THIS FLOW OF YOUR GARDEN AND EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND YOU AT ALL RIGHT BUT IT IN THEIR HEAD THE WRONG THINGS SAID IN THE MORNING HE COULD UP WRONG SOMEBODY SYSTEM INTO WRONG CAN AFFECT THE WAY SHE WILL DIE SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO HER IN THE MORNING
JUST GET IN THERE SHOW THEM LITERALLY WE DON'T DO A LOT WITH IT
HALF AN HOUR THREE COURSE BEFORE SHE GOES TO SHOE SHE GOES AND SITS QUIETLY ON HER OWN LISTENS TO HER MUSIC WE DON'T GO NEARER WE DON'T ANNOY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT CAN WE GO DOWN THE RANGE WITH HER LET HER DO HER OWN THING
YOU'RE HAPPY TO CALL IT A SPORT THERE'S NOT MUCH ATHLETICISM REQUIRED IS THAT I THINK THERE IS ACTUALLY A LOT OF ATHLETICS IN IT I TRAINED SO FIVE DAYS IN THE GYM AND BEING SMALLER THAN IN THE AVERAGE CHEETAH I THINK TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TWO TO THREE HUNDRED SHOTS PURSE TRAINING SESSION IT'S LIKE ALMOST LIKE BEING PUNCHED IN THE SHOULDER TWO HUNDRED TIMES FROM THE RESOURCE
YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG AND I LOVE THE GYM IT'S CHANGED MY CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF GIVES ME EARTH ADVANTAGE MENTALLY AS WELL THINK I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN TO BE FIT AND HEALTHY AND
GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT WHEN I GET OUT ON THE RANGE WHAT ARE HER CHANCES DO YOU THINK IN THE FIRST PHASE OF A MEDAL IN THE SECOND PLACE OF A GOLD MEDAL WE ALWAYS SAID THE AMBITION TO GET HER TO RIO TO MAKE HER OLYMPIAN AND AS FAR AS SAINT IS OLYMPIAN WON'T GO INTO IT THE CHANCES OF A GOLD MEDAL A VERY VERY GOOD
SHE BEATEN EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD AND SOME OF THE WORLD HAVE BEEN HURT SHE'S GOT THE CAPABILITY AND THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF IT TO DO IT BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE DAY THAT HAPPENS YOU'RE QUITE A PROUD GRANDAD
VERY PROUD AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MICHAEL PLAYED IT IN THE FRAME BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SHE'S PROMISED ME IF YOU CAN TICKLE MY DREAM IS STARTING TO COUNTRY THAT I WILL BE COMPETING OLYMPIC GAMES I'M SURE THERE'S BE OTHER AREAS OF MY LIFE I WON'T BE FOCUS ON AS WELL BUT THE CHOUX IS SUCH A BIG PART OF MY LIFE AND I'D LOVE TO THINK I'VE GOT A FEW OLYMPICS IN THE YEAR LET'S HOPE I COME AWAY WITH A MEDAL ONE OF THEM
FAVOURITE FOR THE NEXT ONE AMBER HILL THEY'RE SPEAKING TO ROB BONNET IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE WAS A REMARKABLE MOMENT LAST NIGHT LAST WEEK WHEN THE LEADERS OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE COUNTRIES STARTED THE PROCESS OF SIGNING THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AGREEMENT REACHED IN PARIS AT THE END OF LAST YEAR IT COMMITS THEM TO KEEPING ANY TEMPERATURE RISE TO BELOW TWO DEGREES CENTIGRADE
BUT HOW DO THEY DO THAT LET ALONE GO FURTHER WHICH MANY ARGUE ARGUE IS NEEDED LORD TURNER WHO CHAIRS THE ENERGY TRANSITIONS COMMISSION SAYS DRASTIC ACTION IS NOW NEEDED HE JOINS US HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND COUNTRIES DO HAVE A PLAN THESE SO CALLED INDY SEES THE UNTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS TO TO GET THERE
YES EACH OF THE COUNTRIES WHICH ARE THE SIGNATORIES OF THIS HAVE SET OUT AN INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION AND THOSE ARE A MAJOR STEP FORWARD THAT GETTING ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES ARE RICH AND POOR TO MAKE THOSE COMMITMENTS BUT IF YOU ADD THEM UP AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED THAT OUT ALREADY IF YOU ADD THEM UP THEY WOULD STILL LEAVE US ON A PAR
WHICH WOULD TAKE US TO A WARMING OF SOMETHING LIKE TWO POINT SEVEN TO THREE POINT FOUR DEGREES CENTIGRADE NOT WELL BELOW TWO DEGREES CENTIGRADE AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE QUICKLY EVEN BY TWENTY THIRTY WE'VE GOT TO BE ON A PATH WITH CARBON EMISSIONS SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY PERCENT BELOW THOSE WHICH ARE IN THE COMBINATION OF THE IRON DE SEAS AND THE CHALLENGE IS TO WORK OUT
HOW DO WE ACTUALLY DO THAT WHILE ALSO ENABLING EMERGING AND POORER COUNTRIES TO STILL ECONOMICALLY GROW AND YOUR ANSWER WELL THE ANSWER IS IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A COMBINATION OF STRATEGIES IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY GOING TO REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF
RENEWABLE AND NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY TO DRIVE THE DE CARBON ISATION OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT IS THE AREA WHICH IS GOING INCREDIBLY FAST AT THE MOMENT AND ABOUT WHICH WE CAN BE OPTIMISTIC THE CRUCIAL THING TO REALISE HOWEVER IS THAT ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF GLOBAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION SO WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN FOR EVERYTHING WHICH ISN'T ELECTRICITY EITHER APPLY APPLYING ELECTRICITY
TO THE REST OF THE ENERGY SYSTEM OR BY DRIVING DOWN DEEK A CARBON IN OTHER AREAS OF ENERGY THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO AND IT SOMETIMES GETS MISSED OUT IN THIS IS WE'VE GOT TO ACHIEVE AN INCREASE IN WHAT'S CALLED ENERGY PRODUCTIVITY USE LESS AMOUNTS OF ENERGY PER UNIT OF G. P. PRODUCED THE MOST TWO DIMENSIONS
DE CARBONISE IN THE ENERGY SUPPLY AND ACHIEVING A RAPID GROWTH OF ENERGY PRODUCTIVITY BUT WE'VE GOT TO ACHIEVE WE ARE SO FAR AWAY FROM THAT DE CARBONISED TO GET THE ENERGY SUPPLY AND YET YOU LOOK AT THE REMARK ABOUT ME LAST WEEK THERE WERE SCRAPED LITTLE BIG FANFARE AND BUT ABOUT THE SCALE OF THE AND OF WHAT HAD BEEN ACHIEVED IN PARIS BUT IS IT A YOU THINK WON'T KNOW I LOOK THIS IS A GLASS HALF EMPTY OR HALF FULL BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S HALF FULL AND WE CAN WE CAN BUILD ON THAT
THE FACT IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE I AND D. C. THERE IS A REMARKABLE PROGRESS INTENDED THERE FOR INSTANCE IN RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY WE ARE SEEING THEIR SOLAR ENERGY NOW BEING PROVIDED WITH CONTRACTS FREE MARKET CONTRACTS ACROSS THE WORLD AT AS LOW AS SIX U.S. CENTS
KILOWATT HOUR NOW THAT IS FULLY COMPETITIVE WITH GAS OR COAL SUPPLY SO WE ARE GOING TO SEE AND IT'S IN THE ALLENDE SEES FOR INDIA OR CHINA YOU SEE VERY VERY BIG COMMITMENTS RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY BUT WE'VE GOT IT
EXPAND THE RANGE IN WHICH WE ARE APPLYING LOW CARBON ENERGY TO OTHER AREAS AS WELL AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE'VE REALLY GO BUT YOU'RE OUT YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT EVEN IF THEY DO WHAT THEY'VE SAID THEY'LL DO WE'RE STILL SOME WAY ALWAYS WHISK SOMEWHERE SHORTLY OVER THE FIGURE IS BASICALLY THAT IF YOU ADD UP ALL THE RUN UP TO TWENTY THIRTY WE'VE GOT TO GET ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT
BELOW WHERE THE AGGREGATE OF THE ALLENDE SEES A AND THAT'S JUST TO MEET TWO PER CENT TO MANY PEOPLE SAY ACTUALLY YOU NEED TO GO FAR FURTHER OUT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE YES THAT IS RIGHT WELL I THINK THE CRUCIAL POINT I THINK PARIS HAD IT RIGHT IN TERMS OF OBJECTIVES I THINK ARE WELL BELOW TWO DEGREES SHOULD BE CLEARLY ACHIEVABLE I THINK IT IS TECHNOLOGICALLY ACHIEVABLE PROVIDED THE ROOST THE WILL AND THE INVESTMENT IN THE CORRECT POLICIES AND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PLAYERS WORKING TOGETHER I THINK ONE POINT FIVE BLUNTLY IS
AN ASPIRATION IT WILL BE DAMN DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE O.K. EVEN TWO DEGREES REQUIRES THAT BY THE END OF THE CENTURY WE HAVE AT ZERO CARBON ECONOMY NO COP AT ALL BUT THERE IS ANOTHER ELEMENT WHICH OFTEN GETS MISSED WHEN PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS WHICH IS THE SORT OF REMEDY THE CUP FOR EXAMPLE THE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE WHICH NORWAY AND A COUPLE OF OTHERS ARE LOOKING AT AND WE WERE BUT AREN'T ANY LONGER WELL WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THE TECHNOLOGY CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE WILL BE
I THINK RELATIVE TO WHAT PEOPLE EXPECTED EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED BEING THE CHAIR OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE COMMITTEE IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE AREAS WHICH HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTINGLY SLOW PROGRESS I THINK WE HAVE TO PUT MONEY INTO IT TO WORK OUT ON LOO HOW LARGER SCALE CAN WORK WE'D PROBABLY DEFINITELY NEED IT TO DE CARBONISE SOME
USES OF ENERGY LIKE IN HEAVY INDUSTRY WHERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE ANOTHER WAY FORWARD I THINK WHAT'S LESS CLEAR IS WHETHER IT CAN REALLY BE A BIG TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF DE CARBONISED ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION WHICH SIMPLY DON'T KNOW THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE HAVE TO INVEST IN TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE AS ONE OF THE PORTFOLIO POSSIBILITIES LORD TURN UP ADAIR TURNER THANK YOU VERY MUCH O.K. THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME TEAR ABOUT THE WEATHER PHIL IVORIES HERE NICK AND CONTINUING THE THEME OF TWO DEGREES
TWO DEGREES EITHER SIDE OF THE ER JUST ABOUT COVERS IT FOR MOST OF US THIS MORE IT'S A PRETTY CHILLY OLD START THE BEST I CAN FIND IS ABOUT SIX DEGREES IN THE ISLES OF SCILLY AND LET'S STAY IN THE SOUTH WEST AND INCLUDE WALES TO BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SUPPLY OF SHOWERS HERE COMING IN FROM THE IRISH SEA THE NORTH WEST OF WALES PARTICULARLY PRONE AT THE MOMENT SO TWO AREAS WEST OF THE TAMER THE SHOWERS BECOMING A WEE BIT MORE PREVALENT ACROSS THE ZONE DURING THE COURSE OF THE LATTER PART OF THE MORNING INTO THE FIRST PART OF THE AFTERNOON AND THEN RATHER MIRACULOUSLY THEY'LL FADE AWAY COME EVENING
AND THERE'LL BE SOME GLORIOUS SUNSHINE TO FINISH OFF AND IF YOU SHELTER FROM THE NORTHERLY BREEZE YOU MIGHT GET UP TO TWELVE IF YOU'RE NOT YOU COULD BE CLOSE TO WASTE OR NINE NOW TO THE REST OF ENGLAND WELL THE SUPPLY OF SHOWERS TO COME IN OFF THE NORTH SEA INTO EASTERN COASTAL AREAS AT THE MOMENT IN SOME PLACES ONCE IT IS QUITE SHARP MAYBE A RUMBLE OF THUNDER THROUGH THE DAY AND THE SHOWERS WILL BECOME A GOOD DEAL MORE PREVALENT DON'T GET CAUGHT OUT IF YOU'RE STEPPING OUT TODAY BECAUSE HE MIGHT HAVE A DRY BRIGHT CHILLY START BUT I'M SURE YOU'LL SEE A SHOWER LATER ON IN THE DAY SUMMER'S REALLY QUITE HEAVY AND DON'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY ARE WINTRY HAIL
WEE BIT OF SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER GROUND THAT SORT OF THING AND AGAIN SOME TWELVE COVERS IT NORTHERN IRELAND SUNNY SPELLS AND SHOWERS IF YOU'RE EXPOSED TO THE NORTHERLY YOU'LL SEE MORE THAN YOUR FAIR SHARE ONE OR TWO SPOTS COULD STAY DRY THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE'RE LOOKING AT A HEIGHT OF SIX SEVEN OR EIGHT AND FOR SCOTLAND WITH A NORTHERLY BREEZE NORTHERN AREAS AND THE COASTAL FRINGES TEND TO CATCH THAT BULK OF THE SHOWERS CENTRAL BELT MAY GET AWAY WITH A DRY DAY AND A HIGH OF EIGHT

THE WEIGHT IS FOR THE OUTCOMES OF THE POLICE INVESTIGATION WHICH IS SEEKING TO ESTABLISH WHETHER ANYONE ACTED CRIMINALLY DURING THE TRAGEDY AND FOR ANOTHER INQUIRY WHICH IS LOOKING INTO THE ALLEGATIONS OF A COVER UP BY OFFICERS AFTER THE MATCH
ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE BEREAVED THEY NOW HAVE THE TRUTH BUT SHE WENT ON TRUE JUSTICE WOULD ONLY COME WHEN THEY HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY

I DON'T THINK SHE'D GET FIVE PER CENT OF THE VOTE THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE BEAT BERNIE SANDRA'S IN FOUR OUT OF FIVE CONTESTS OPENING UP AN INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD AND SHE CALLED FOR DEMOCRATS TO COME TOGETHER AROUND HER CANDIDACY WE WELL UNIFY OUR PARTY TILL WHEN THEIR SELECTION AND BUILD IN AMERICA WHERE WE CAN ALL RISE TOGETHER
AMERICA WHERE WE LIFT EACH OTHER UP INSTEAD OF TEARING IN
THE DEMOCRATIC RACES ALL BUT OVER BUT FOR ALL DONALD TRUMP'S BOASTS THAT CAN'T YET BE SAID OF THE REPUBLICAN CONTEST
THE TECHNOLOGY GIANT APPLE AS REPORTED ITS FIRST FALLING QUARTERLY REVENUE IN MORE THAN A DECADE SALES OF THE IFE PHONE HAVE ALSO FALLEN FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE FIRM'S SIGNATURE PRODUCT WAS LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN APPLES STILL MADE OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS ABOUT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS HE'S OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT RORY CATHERINE JONES
OVER THE LAST THIRTEEN YEARS A SERIES OF GROUNDBREAKING PRODUCTS HAVE PUSHED APPLES SALES EVER HIGHER AND IT'S GROWN INTO THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY BUT NOW THAT RUN HAS COME TO AN END SALES IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS WERE DOWN TWELVE PERCENT ON THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR WITH PROFITS ALSO LOWER
THE MAIN REASON WAS THAT SALES OF THE I. PHONE PERHAPS THE MOST PROFITABLE SINGLE PRODUCT IN HISTORY APPEAR TO HAVE PETE THE COMPANY SOLD TEN MILLION FEWER PHONES THAN IT DID LAST YEAR IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE HARD TO BEAT RESULTS WHICH BENEFITED FROM A BIG SURGE IN CHINESE SALES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT INVESTORS ARE GETTING INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE LACK OF A NEW BLOCKBUSTER PRODUCT TO FOLLOW THE I PHONE
B.B.C. NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT THE OWNER OF B.H.S. TRANSFERRED ONE AND A HALF MILLION POUNDS FROM THE RETAILER TO A SEPARATE COMPANY LAST WEEK AS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT B.H.S. WAS GOING INTO ADMINISTRATION THERE'S NO SUGGESTION DOMINIC POWELL HAS DONE ANYTHING ILLEGAL IT'S A BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK
ON TUESDAY OF LAST WEEK DOMINIC SHAP HELL MOVED ONE AND A HALF MILLION POUNDS OF THE FAILING RETAILERS MONEY TO A SWEDISH COMPANY OWNED BY A FRIEND AND FELLOW BOARD MEMBER B.H.S. CHIEF EXECUTIVE DARREN TOP DEMANDED ITS RETURN ON A WEDNESDAY AND ON THURSDAY IT WAS RETURNED MINUS FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH WAS EXPLAINED AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE CHARGES
DOMINIC SHEP HOW HAS ALSO CLAIMED THAT A SIXTY MILLION POUND LOAN A CRUCIAL PART OF THE B.H.S. RESCUE FELL THROUGH BECAUSE PHILIP GREEN REFUSED TO ALLOW AN I.O.U. OF FORTY MILLION POUNDS TO BE CONSIDERED A LOWER PRIORITY B.H.S. REFUTE THIS SAYING THE LANE WAS UNACCEPTABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE DUE TO ITS HEIGHT UPFRONT COSTS THESE NEW DETAILS WILL PROMPT MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE CONSORTIUM WHO BOUGHT B.H.S. JUST OVER A YEAR AGO FROM SIR PHILIP GREEN WHO HIMSELF HAS BEEN ASKED TO APPEAR BEFORE A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S
TECHNICAL DIRECTOR OF BRITISH CYCLING SHANE SUTTON HAS BEEN SUSPENDED ON AN INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED DISCRIMINATION TAKES PLACE HE DENIES WRONGDOING
SOME FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTERS AND TORY COUNCILLORS HAVE ATTACKED PLANS ANNOUNCED BY THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE TO CREATE NEW ELECTED MAYORS IN PARLIAMENT TODAY CRITICS WILL QUESTION THE NEED FOR ANOTHER LAYER OF GOVERNMENT IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS
ANOTHER FEATURE OF GEORGE OSBORNE'S BUDGET IS UNDER ATTACK FROM HIS OWN SIDE THIS TIME HIS PLANS FOR ELECTED MAYORS IN THREE SUBSTANTIALLY RURAL PARTS OF ENGLAND LOCAL COUNCILLORS AND CONSERVATIVE M.P.S ARE AMONG THOSE OPPOSED TO THE IDEA
THE FORMER FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER SIR HENRY BELLINGHAM SAID IT WOULD ADD AN EXTRA EXPENSIVE TIER OF GOVERNMENT AND CRITICS INCLUDING THE NORTH SOMERSET M.P. LIAM FOX BELIEVE SOME COUNCILS COULD REJECT THE POLICY AND INFECT OPT OUT OF NEW AUTHORITIES AND GREATER LINCOLNSHIRE THE WEST OF ENGLAND AND EAST ANGLIA A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE CHANCE THERE SAID THE IDEA OF DEVOLUTION HAD AN UNSTOPPABLE MOMENTUM BEHIND IT AND WOULD EMPOWER CITIES AND REGIONS BUT IT WOULD NOT BE IMPOSED ON LOCAL AREAS
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S SAYS URGENT ACTION IS NEEDED TO STOP UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR BEING KILLED BY ILLNESS IS CAUSED BY AIR POLLUTION ENVIRONMENT FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SAYS NEW CLEAN AIR ZONES ARE NEEDED IN DOZENS OF ENGLISH TOWNS AND CITIES HERE'S OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER
THE PRESSURE'S GROWING ON MINISTERS OVER AIR POLLUTION FIRST THERE WAS THE EMISSIONS TESTING SCANDAL INVOLVING DIESEL CAR MAKERS THEN A LEGAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE AIR IN MANY CITIES IS JUDGED UNFIT TO BREATHE
THE GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONDED WITH PLANS FOR CLEAN AIR ZONES FOR BIRMINGHAM LEEDS NOTTINGHAM DERBY AND SOUTHAMPTON COUNCILS THERE WILL HAVE POWERS TO CHARGE OF VEHICLES TO ENTER CENTRAL AREAS
BUT M.P.S SAY ALL POLLUTED CITIES MUST BE GIVEN POWERS TO TACKLE AIR POLLUTION IN THE WAY THEY THINK FIT
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS CITIES EXISTING POWERS ADEQUATE BUT THE COMMITTEE SAYS IF THIS WAS THE PROBLEM WOULD'VE BEEN SOLVED ALREADY
ROGER HAVE BEEN REPORTING IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY WILL MAKE A STATEMENT IN THE COMMONS LATER TODAY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW NOW THAN AN INQUEST JURY HAS RULED THAT THE NINETY SIX KILLED AT HILLSBOROUGH WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED THE MATCH COMMANDER CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT DAVID AND FIELD WAS FOUND RESPONSIBLE FOR MANSLAUGHTER BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE
DURING THE INQUEST HE ADMITTED MAKING MISTAKES AND LYING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT CAME WHEN HE WAS QUESTIONED BY PAUL GREENY Q.C. THE BARRISTER WHO WAS REPRESENTING THE POLICE FEDERATION AND WHO JOINS US NOW FROM YORK GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
COULD YOU START BY EXPLAINING WHAT WHAT MIGHT SEEM A BIT UNUSUAL IN THAT THE YOU WERE ACTING FOR THE POLICE FEDERATION AND IN DOING SO YOU ENDED UP I SUPPOSE GUNNING FOR CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT DAVID ARKENFIELD WELL THAT IS THE POSITION
AS THE ADVOCATE FOR THE POLICE FEDERATION I WAS EFFECTIVELY REPRESENTING THE JUNIOR RANKED OFFICERS RANK AND FILE WHO WERE PRESENT ON THE DAY OF THE DISASTER
SINCE THE FIFTEENTH OF APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE HAS BEEN A TENDENCY ON THE PART OF THE PUBLIC FOR REASONS THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE TO LUMP THE POLICE TOGETHER TO TREAT THEM AS IF THEY HAVE A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST ON ALL ISSUES
A WREN DURING THE COURSE OF THE INQUEST WAS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS WAS VERY FAR FROM THE POSITION ON THAT IT FELT THE REALITY WAS THAT THE RANK AND FILE OFFICERS IN THE FACE OF SENIOR FAILURES BY SENIOR OFFICERS AND SERIOUS FAILURES BY THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HAD DONE THEIR LEVEL BEST SO IT BECAME OUR APPROACH
OR A STRATEGY TO HIGHLIGHT THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP THAT THERE HAD BEEN ON THE ON THE DAY ANDREW TUCK THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT AND PRIOR TO THAT IS IT WAS IT A POLICY ON THE BEHALF OF SENIOR PART OF SENIOR
OFFICERS THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO KEEP THE POLICE TOGETHER TO SAY THAT ALL THE POLICE WERE COLLECTIVELY RESPONSIBLE I HAVEN'T DETECTED ANY SPECIFIC STRATEGY TO TO THAT EFFECT BUT BUT CERTAINLY IN THE RESULT THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE COURSE OF THE TAYLOR INQUIRY AND DURING THE COURSE OF THE THE ORIGINAL INQUEST INTO THE INTO THE DEATHS
THERE WAS A MOMENT IT WAS WHEN THE THE DAVID DUCK AND FIELD WAS BEING QUESTIONED BY YOU THAT HE ADMITTED THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE DID YOU EXPECT THAT
I EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT I OPPOSED THEM THAT ISSUE IN THE WAY IN WHICH YOU DID I THINK WHAT SURPRISED ME
THE STOCK MUST HAVE HIS HIS ANSWERS AND THE LACK OF QUALIFICATION AND SO HE GAVE VERY CLEAR AND LET IT BE SAID CANDID ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS
BECAUSE YOU ASKED HIM SPECIFICALLY THAT HIS DECISION TO CLOSE THE TUNNEL BECAUSE IT WAS HIS DECISION TO OPEN THE GATE SOMETHING HE HAD LIED ABOUT BUT ALSO THAT DECISION TO CLOSE THE TUNNEL THAT IF HE HADN'T DONE THAT
THAT IT WAS SORRY THAT HE HAD LEFT IT OPEN IF HE HAD CLOSED IT WOULD HAVE SAVED LIVES AND THAT THE FAILURE TO DO SO WAS HIS OWN AND HIS FAILURE WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE DEATHS OF NINETY SIX PEOPLE AT HILLSBOROUGH AND HE JUST IMMEDIATELY SAID YES
YES WELL ANSWERED AS I'VE SAID VERY STARKLY YES IN ANSWER TO A SERIES OF FIVE QUESTIONS THAT LED TO THAT CONCLUSION THAT HE'S FAIRLY WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF NINETY SIX PERSONS IN THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER DO YOU THINK THAT WAS THE MOMENT AT WHICH EFFECTIVELY THE THE VERDICT WAS
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT I WAS ABLE TO BUILD A POND SOME REALLY EXCELLENT QUESTIONING
BY OTHER ADVOCATES INCLUDING CHRISTINA LUMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE CORONER MIKE MANSFIELD AND AND PETE WETHERBY AND SO MY AIM WAS TO REALLY PULL THE THE STRANDS TOGETHER BUT I'M CERTAIN THAT IN COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE JURY HAD REGARD TO ALL OF THE EVIDENCE OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS AS OPPOSED TO
A SINGLE NINETY MINUTES IN ONE SERIES OF QUESTIONS WHEN YOU FINISHED QUESTIONING DURING THE INQUEST YOU SAID AT THE END I'M JUST WITHIN NINETY MINUTES YES WHAT WHY DID YOU SAY THAT AND WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS
WILL BE THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION I'VE SEEN THAT IT WAS A REFERENCE TO THE LENGTH OF A FOOTBALL MATCH BUT IT WASN'T
IT WAS IT WAS BASED UPON THE FACT THAT THE THE CORONER AT THE INQUEST WITH TRUE PROFICIENCY
THAT DURING THE COURSE OF THE INQUEST WE HAD TO GIVE INDICATIONS OF HOW LONG WE EXPECTED TO BE WITH EACH WITNESS I HAD INDICATED THAT I EXPECTED TO BE NINETY MINUTES OR SO THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF MY QUESTIONS AND AT THE END MY INDICATED THAT I'D ACHIEVE THAT'S NOT FINISHED JUST WITHIN THAT PERIOD
YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT YOU WERE REPRESENTING RANK AND FILE OF THE OBVIOUS OFFICES HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT THE VERDICT THE OUTCOME YES
UM I BELIEVE THE MOST RANK AND FILE OFFICERS WILL UNDERSTAND THE CONCLUSIONS THAT THE JURY WHO HAVE COME TO THAT
AS WITH THE PUBLICAN IN GENERAL THE THOUGHTS WILL BE WITH THE BRIE FAMILIES FAMILIES OF THE NINETY SIX WHO HAVE BEEN ON SUCH A LONG JOURNEY TO ACHIEVE WHAT THEY ACHIEVED YESTERDAY THAT WAS IT THE RULING THEY WANTED
I DON'T THINK THAT MY MY CLIMB THE POLICE FEDERATION WANT TODAY A PARTICULAR RULE
WHAT MY CLIENT WANTED TO DO WAS TO PARTICIPATE FULLY TRANSPARENTLY IN A PROCESS WHICH WAS ONE OF TRUE INTEGRITY TO ASSIST THE JURY TO REACH CONCLUSIONS WHICH WERE SOUND ON THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS THEIR OWN AND THAT IS WHAT WE NOW HAVE I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT
GREENIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
IT IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN MULTI BUYS BUY ONE GET ONE FREE WAS NOW PRICING THEY'RE ALL WAYS IN WHICH SUPERMARKETS GIVES THE IMPRESSION WE'RE GETTING A BARGAIN WHILST IN FACT INCREASING THEIR PROFITS TODAY THE COMPETITIONS AND MARKETS AUTHORITY ANNOUNCES WHAT EAT IS DOING ABOUT IT THE SAME EH HE'S RESPONDING TO WHAT'S CALLED A SUPER COMPLAINT MADE BY THE CONSUMER WATCHDOG WHICH ABOUT MISLEADING OR OPAQUE PRICING ON WE'RE TOLD

OF SOME MISLEADING PRACTICES SO WE CAME ACROSS EXAMPLES WHERE YOU'VE GOT A REDUCED PRICE AND IT'S IT'S THREE POUNDS AND IT SAYS THAT THE NORMAL PRICE WAS FOUR POUNDS BUT IN FACT THE NORMAL PRICE WAS ONLY THAT FOR A SHORTER PERIOD THAN THE SPECIAL OFFER AND WE THINK THAT'S MISLEADING OR YOU'VE GOT WHAT YOU CALLED A MULTI BUY OFFER WHERE IT SAYS
THREE FOR THE PRICE OF TWO BUT IN FACT BEFORE THAT MULTI BUY OFFER THE INDIVIDUAL PRICE WAS MORE EXPENSIVE WHAT WAS NO MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEN THAN NOW SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WERE AT THE COMPETITIONS ARE MARKETS AUTHORITY CAN SIMPLY BAN SIMPLY SAY NO YOU CAN'T DO IT OR DO YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE SUPERMARKETS AND PERSUADE THEM WELL IT'S THE LAW THAT BAND'S MISLEADING PRACTICES
WHAT WE CAN DO IS INVESTIGATE AND IN THIS CASE WE THOUGHT WE'D TRY AND GET THIS SOLVED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO WE ENGAGED WITH ALL THE SUPERMARKETS AND THEY AGREED TO REVIEW THEIR PRICING PRACTICES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT MISLEADING WITH AS TO WHERE WE HAD SPECIFIC CONCERNS WE'VE SECURED FROM THEM IN WRITING A FORMAL COMMITMENT THAT THE KIND OF PRACTICES THAT I'VE DESCRIBED
WON'T HAPPEN AND THAT COMMITMENT IS IN WRITING AND IT'S PUBLIC AND IT'S AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE AND JUST TO BE CLEAR ON ASDA AS AN EXAMPLE THEN IF IT SAYS NOW WAS IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS ON OFFER FOR HER IT'S NOW ON OFFER FOR A LOWER PRICE THAN IT USED TO BE IT'S ABOUT THE TIMING OF THAT THAT YOUR SAUCE YES THAT'S RIGHT THERE USED TO BE EVERYONE WHEN THEY SEE THAT THEY THINK THAT'S THE NORMAL PRICE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT

WELL I MEAN WE WE INVESTIGATE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A RANGE OF INDUSTRIES FROM TIME TO TIME THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S CAUSED PEOPLE REAL CONCERN WE'RE AWARE OF CONCERNS WHICH IS AWARE OF CONCERNS TRADING STANDARDS CITIZENS' ADVICE AND WHEN WE'RE AWARE OF THOSE CONCERNS WE TRIED TO FIX IT AND IN THIS CASE WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE REACHED VERY SENSIBLE ARRANGEMENT THAT MAKE SURE
OTHER SUPERMARKETS AND ASDA ABOUT HIM WE HAD SPECIFIC CONCERNS ARE GOING TO PUT THIS RIGHT AND MAKE SURE THAT WHEN CUSTOMERS GO SHOPPING AND THEY SEE A SPECIAL OFFER THEY CAN BE MORE CONFIDENT BEFORE THAT THEY'RE REALLY GETTING A BARGAIN MICHAEL BRIMFUL OF THE COMPETITIONS ARE MARKETS AUTHORITY THANK YOU DO YOU
IT'S NINETY MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE O.E.C.D. THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT HAS WADED IN TO THE BRECK'S IT DEBATE WITH MORE ON THAT ROB YEUNG IS HERE ROB YES LORDS ALLSORTS OF PREDICTIONS ARE BEING PUBLISHED OUT THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND SOME OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS OF THE VARIOUS ECONOMIC FORECASTS ON HOW MUCH BETTER OR WORSE OFF WE WILL BE IF WE STAY IN OR LEAVE
EUROPEAN UNION AND THE LATEST ORGANISATION TO ENTER THIS ALPHABET SOUP OF ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE PILING INTO THE DEBATE IS THE O.E.C.D. THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS AN ECONOMIC CLUB MADE UP OF DOZENS OF RICH COUNTRIES AND IN A REPORT AT PUBLISHING TODAY IT SAYS AN E. U. X. IT WILL MEAN THE AVERAGE WORKING BRITAIN LOSING OUT ON THE EQUIVALENT OF A MONTH'S PAY BY TWENTY TWENTY WILL WITH US AS THE GENERAL SECRETARY AND HELD GLORIA GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING HOW DO YOU DO ON WHAT BASIS DO YOU MAKE THIS ASSERTION WELL WE WE MADE A WHOLE SERIES OF CALCULATIONS SO WE COME UP SAYING WRETCHED HIS ATTACKS
HE'S LIKE A TAX BREAKS AS LIKE A TAX AND IT'S EQUIVALENT TO ROUGHLY ABOUT ONE MONTH'S INCOME WITHIN FOUR YEARS BUT THEN IT CARRIES ON
TO THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE TWENTY THE TWENTY THIRTY AND THERE IS A CONSISTENT LOSS
WHICH IS ALSO WHAT OTHER RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT WHAT THIS IS WHERE WE'RE SAYING RICHARD IS IS A TAX THAT TAX IS GOING TO CONTINUE
TO BE PAID RISER BRITAIN'S OVERTIME USE WORDS LIKE TAX AND LOST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS A PREDICTION FOR LOWER THAN EXPECTED ECONOMIC GROWTH DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN WORK AND THEREFORE THIS IS NOT PEOPLE HANDING OVER MORE MONEY THAN THEY ARE TODAY OR INDEED BEING WORSE OFF THAN THEY ARE TODAY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS A JOKE YOU KNOW COMPRA IN COMPARISON WITH THE BASELINE SCENARIO THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE HAD IN IN
IN THEIR POCKET TO SPEND THEY WILL NOT HAVE IT THEREFORE IT IS AS POWERFUL AS REAL
AS HE TAGS OR AS IF YOU WOULD JUST GIVE IT OVER AT SOMEBODY BUT THE WHOLE THE WHOLE IDEA HERE IS YOU KNOW WE WE DUNDEE COMPARISONS REDUNDANT SIMULATION AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THIS WILL HAPPEN
AND IN THE END WE COME OUT AND SAYING WHY ARE WE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME SO MUCH EFFORT SO MUCH TALENT IN TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO COMPENSATE FOR A BAD DECISION BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO TAKE THE BAD THERE IS ANOTHER VIEW OF COURSE SUCH AS THAT OF BORIS JOHNSON AN OUT OF LONDON WHO SAYS AT THE LONG TERM BENEFITS OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD OUTWEIGH ANY SHORT TERM COST ISN'T THE TRUTH THAT NOBODY YOU INCLUDED
NO I THINK WHATEVER HIS MOTIVATIONS MAYBE WHAT WOULD REAR BRITS BRITAIN TING AND WE DO THAT AT TEN THIRTY TODAY AT THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS A WHOLE BOOK ABOUT EVERY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE CALCULATION THIS IS NOT WISHFUL THINKING WHICH WE BELIEVE THAT THE WRETCHED CAMP IN MANY CASES HAS BEEN ASSUMING A NUMBER OF
YOU KNOW THINGS THAT COULD GO IN THERE AWAY THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHY FOR EXAMPLE YOU GET A SWEDE A TRADE DEAL THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU WERE HEAD AS FREDA INVESTMENT DEAL O.K. WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE US READER AT MIGRATION THE OTHERS NO KIND OF A DEAL THAT COULD GO BETTER BY YOURSELVES THAN YOU WOULD BE IN THE COMPANY OF THE EUROPEANS O.K. IF CAMPAIGNERS WOULD OF COURSE TAKE IVY BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HELGA
IT IS NOW SEVEN TWENTY TWO WHERE MANCHESTER LED THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WOULD FOLLOW THAT AT LEAST WAS THE THEORY ONE PART OF GEORGE OSBORNE'S PLAN TO CREATE A NORTHERN HOUSE WAS TO HAVE A DIRECTLY ELECTED MAYOR WITH SIGNIFICANT POWER'S NOT JUST FOR THE CITY BUT THE SURROUNDING REGION ITS BUDGET THE CHANCELLOR MADE CLEAR THAT HE WANTED NOT JUST MANCHESTER NOT JUST OTHER THE BIG CITY REGIONS TO HAVE THOSE MARES BUT OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TOO AND IT IS ANOTHER OF HIS BUDGET PLANS
WHICH APPEARS TO BE IN TROUBLE AND ALL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS IS DELIGHTING IN DIGGING OUT AREAS OF DIFFICULTY IN THAT BUDGET NOT EASY THIS FOR MY WHAT IS IT IT'S POTENTIALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE AS YOU SAY THERE ARE PLANS PRETTY MUCH UNDERWAY IN SEVEN AREAS MOSTLY URBAN ONES AND THIS IS THE POINT AT THE BUDGET THERE WERE THREE NEW ONES AND THEY WERE SUBSTANTIALLY RURAL AND SOME CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE IDEA OF TRANSFORMING A PLAN FOR AN URBAN AREA
A LARGELY RURAL ONE AMONG THEM STUART JACKSON WHO SECURED A DEBATE TODAY TO EXPRESS HIS DOUBTS AND WE'LL ALSO HEAR IN THAT DEBATE FROM SIR HENRY BELLINGHAM IN NORTH WEST NORFOLK M.P. A FORMER FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER WHO SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF DEVOLUTION BUT WANTS THE PLANS FOR A DIRECTLY ELECTED MAYOR TO BE PUT ON HOLD HE SAYS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD ACTUALLY CAST THEIR VOTES FOR ONE OF THOSE MARES WOULD BE PATHETIC
YOU DON'T HAVE POWER BUT YOU HAVE THAT SOVEREIGNTY BECAUSE YOU'RE ELECTED BY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON QUITE A BIG TURN OUT I DON'T WANT ORIGINAL LEADER COMING ALONG SAY LOOK HENRY BEEN A BAD BOY OR GATHER YOU DON'T WANT THIS INCINERATOR YOU DON'T WANT THESE HOUSES WELL ACTUALLY REGION DO YOU WATCH IT AND I'D LIKE YOU TO HAVE IT NOW
THAT I THINK'S GOING TO PUT PEAS IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION AND CHANGE THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION NOW EAST ANGLIA GREATER LINCOLNSHIRE IN THE WEST OF ENGLAND OTHER PLACES WHERE GEORGE OSBORNE PROMISED THE AUTHORITIES WITH THESE MARES AT THE BUDGET AND THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL WILL DESCEND ON THE RECORD AND OFF FROM CONSERVATIVES IN THOSE AREAS I'VE SPOKEN TO OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS SOME OF WHOM ARE PRETTY SENIOR ONE OF THEM LIAM FOX OR NORTH SOMERSET M.P. THINKS HIS COUNSEL WILL SIMPLY THROW OUT AN IDEA THAT HE SAYS HE'S ON CONSERVATIVE
I THINK IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY TOLD BIG COMPREHENSIVELY REJECTED WHICH WILL BE A VERY CLEAR SIGN THAT AT THE GROUND LEVEL IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN CONSERVATIVE AUTHORITIES THEY SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO METROPOLITAN
AND AN URBAN ORIENTED MERE THRUST UPON THEM SO THOSE CONSERVATIVE AUTHORITIES CAN THEY ACTUALLY BLOCK THIS PROPOSAL
YES IT SEEMS APART THEY CAN AND THIS REALLY IS THE POINT HERE THE COUNCIL'S NEED TO RATIFY BROAD AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND THAT SEEMS TO MEAN IF THEY DECIDE TO THEY COULD IN EFFECT OPT OUT WHICH COULD MEAN A BIG SWEEPING PLAN SET OUT IN THEIR BUDGET COULD END UP WITH SOME HOLES IN IT CLIFF JORDAN IS THE LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE GROUP OR NORFOLK COUNTY COUNCIL AND HE THINKS THAT COUNCIL WILL VOTE AGAINST
THE PEOPLE OF NANTES WILL THINK THAT THEY CAN GOVERN THEMSELVES THEY DON'T NEED ANYBODY A SHIT AND OVER ABOVE FROM FAR AWAY BECAUSE HE HAD NOT TALK LIKE THAT SEE YOU TALK ONE OF THREE CANDY CAUSE AREAS WHICH IS A HELL OF A SIZE
AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY SEEMED VERY DISTANT NOW THE LABOUR LEADER OF HIS COUNCIL TOBY WHAT HE TOO WAS A FAN OF DEVOLUTION HE WAS ALSO OPPOSED TO THE POLICY AS IT STOOD CAMBRIDGESHIRE WHERE THEY HAVE A A TORY LEADER HAS REJECTED THE PLAN IN ITS CURRENT FORM IT HAS TO BE SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS VERY CONFIDENT A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE CHANCELLOR SAYS
DEVOLUTION WAS TAKING PLACE ACROSS THE COUNTRY UNSTOPPABLE MOMENTUM ONLY TAKING PLACE WHERE COMMUNITIES WANTED IT THERE ARE PLENTY OF ENTHUSIASTS FOR DEVOLUTION ELECTED MAYOR IN THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY AND IN COUNCILS AND SOME OF THEM WILL OF COURSE LIKE MANY CITIES HAVE DONE EMBRACE THE IDEA OF MORE POWER AND MORE MONEY FOR EXAMPLE IN MANCHESTER WHERE THERE ARE BIG IMPORTANT CHANGES BUT IT MAY WELL BE THAT THIS STICK IS ANOTHER POLICY THAT DIFFICULT AT THE VERY LEAST TO PUT IN PLACE
IN FULL THAN IT DID WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED ON BUDGET DAY ROSS HAWKINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ACADEMIES MEN YOU NEED MAJORITY TO DELIVER THEM AND GEORGE OSBORNE HASN'T GOT A PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY FOR MANY OF HIS IDEAS TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SEVEN TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS SONALI OLLIE SHARDS BACK WITH US HELLO AGAIN MANCHESTER CITY HELD REAL MADRID TO A NIL NIL DRAW IN THE FIRST LEG OF THEIR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL LAST NIGHT JOHN MURRAY WAS COMMENTATING ON THE MATCH AT THE ETIHAD STADIUM AND JOINS US NOW MORNING JOHN MORNING
IT WASN'T AN EVENT AND INVENT MATCH WAS IT BUT HOW IMPORTANT A RESULT IS THIS THE CITY PREVENTING REAL SCORING AN AWAY GOAL NO IT WASN'T A GOOD PROPORTION OF THE DRAMA AND EXCITEMENT ACTUALLY CAME BEFORE THE MATCH EVEN KICKED OFF FIRST WHEN WE LEARNED THAT CRISTIANO RONALDO OR WASN'T GOING TO BE FIT ENOUGH TO PLAY AND THEN MANCHESTER CITY STAGED AND THEIR SUPPORTERS AS WELL A WONDERFUL SHOW IN THE STADIUM PRE MATCH IT WAS A REAL SPECTACLE BUT
THE GAME ITSELF BIT OF A LET DOWN PARTICULARLY THE FIRST HALF BUT AS THE MANCHESTER CITY MANAGER MANUEL PELLEGRINI SUGGESTED IF THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO WIN IT THE NEXT BEST RESULT WAS A NIL NIL DRAW I NOT CONCEDING THAT AWAY GOAL SO A SCORE DRAW A WEEK TONIGHT
WOULD PUT REAL MADRID OUT AND TAKES CITY HE THREW IT FELT LIKE WE WERE PLAYING CAUTIOUSLY PERHAPS BECAUSE OF RONALDO'S ABSENCE IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE THE SAME NEXT WEEK DURING THE SECOND LEG AT THE BURN ABOUT WITH IT AS WELL AS DOING WITHOUT RENELLE DOT ACTUALLY LOST THEIR CENTRE FORWARD CARRYING BEN'S AT HALF TIME WITH AN INJURY SO
SO GARETH BILL WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE B.B.C. FRONT LINE AS THEY CALL THEM THAT THEY HAD LEFT AND WE ONLY SAW THE OCCASIONAL FLASH OF DANGER FROM GARETH BALE I THINK REAL MADRID AS WELL LEARNT FROM THEIR QUARTER FINAL WHEN THEY LOST THE FIRST LEG TWO NIL AWAY IN GERMANY AGAINST WOLFSBURG AND WORK WERE DETERMINED THAT THAT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN ALTHOUGH IN SAYING THAT BY THE END CITY VERY MUCH HAD THEIR GOALKEEPER JOE HART TO THANK FOR A COUPLE OF VERY IMPORTANT SAVES WHICH MADE SURE OF THAT CLEAN SHEET
DON'T WORRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOE HART MAN OF THE MATCH LAST NIGHT THE FIRST LEG OF THE OTHER SEMI FINAL BETWEEN ATHLETICO MADRID AND BY MUNICH TAKES PLACE IN SPAIN TONIGHT HULL STRENGTHENED THEIR HOLD ON TO FOURTH PLACE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP WITH A TWO NIL WIN OVER BRENTFORD DELI ALI COULD MISS THE REST OF TOTTENHAM SEASON IT'S AFTER BEING CHARGED WITH VIOLENT CONDUCT BY THE F.A.

WAS GOING INTO ADMINISTRATION DOMINIC CHARLES POWELL MOVED THE FUNDS BUT TRANSFERRED THE VAST MAJORITY BACK TWO DAYS LATER AT THE REQUEST OF THE B.H.S. CHIEF EXECUTIVE DARREN TOP THERE'S NO SUGGESTION MY SHUT POWELL HAS DONE ANYTHING ILLEGAL
IT'S NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE ABOUT THE AIR WE BREATHE IT'S NOT LIKE WATER YOU CAN'T BOTTLE IT WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE TRUST THOSE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO PROTECT IT
THE EMISSIONS TESTING SCANDALS HAVE SHOWN THAT SOME CAR MAKERS HAVE BEEN LYING AND LAST YEAR THE SUPREME COURT ORDERED MINISTERS TO COMPLY WITH EUROPEAN UNION RESTRICTIONS ON NITROGEN DOC DIOXIDE IN THE AIR
THIRTY EIGHT OF BRITAIN'S FORTY THREE AIR QUALITY ZONES EXCEED AIR SAFETY LIMIT LIMITS ITS PROMISE PROMPTED M.P.S ON THE ENVIRONMENT FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TO SAY THE GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE URGENT ACTION THAT IT MUST ALLOW COUNCILS ACROSS ENGLAND
TO SET UP NEW CLEAN AIR ZONES AND IT SHOULD SUBSIDISE ARE SCRAPPING SCHEME FOR DIESEL CARS WE'RE JOINED BY THE CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE NEIL PARISH M. P. AND WE'RE JOINED FROM OXFORD BY DOCTOR HEATHER WALTON WHO SEEN ELEKTRA AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR WHARTON TALKS ABOUT IT AS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS THAT HOW YOU SEE IT
CERTAINLY THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH IMPACTS THE COMMITTEE ON THE MEDICAL EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS IN TWENTY TEN ESTIMATED THAT AROUND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DEATHS
OR PUT ANOTHER WAY THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND KNIFE IS LOST ACROSS THE POPULATION WERE RESULT PARTICULAR AIR POLLUTION BUT MORE RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN A STRENGTHENING OF THE EVIDENCE ON THE DARK SIDE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE IMPACT MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT BIGGER THAN THAT AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES FURTHER ATTENTION
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE FIGURE IN THE REPORT THE PARISHES THAT YOU RECKON UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE EARLY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS ARE POLICE THEIR STEPNEY HAD LINK THREE NOW BETWEEN NITROGEN DIOXIDE AND THESE EARLIER DEATHS AND SO IT'S KEY NOW BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DRIVING VEHICLES AND DRIVE US TOWARDS DIESER VEHICLES FOR YEARS AND NOW IT'S VERY MUCH NOW TO CONVERT FROM DIESEL TO HYBRID
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND OF COURSE HOT SPOTS IN CITY ESPECIALLY CITIES LIKE LONDON WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS BELOW FORTY MICROGRAMS PER CUBIC METRE OF THERE THAT IS THE PROBLEM AND SO IT'S DEALING WITH THAT TAXIS DEALING WITH OUR VANS AS WELL AS PRIVATE VEHICLES AND BUSES AND OF COURSE AND THEN WE'VE ALSO GOT ALLOW CITIES LIKE BIRMINGHAM KNOTTING DERBYSHIRE
SOUTHAMPTON THE KNEES OR SAY THE LOOK AT VARIOUS MEANS OF REDUCING POLLUTION IT MIGHT BE BY HAVING A PARK AND RIDE SCHEMES IT MIGHT BE SENDING TRAFFIC IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS PEDESTRIAN ZONES ALL SORTS OF ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BUT OF COURSE OVERALL WE WANT TO TAKE OUT THE OLDER DIESELS THE TEN YEAR DIESELS AND BEYOND AND ACTUALLY ACTUALLY NOW MOVE PEOPLE MUCH MORE TOWARDS HYBRID AND ELECTRIC CARS
AND AWAY FROM FROM THESE I WANT TO GOOD GOVERNMENT SAYS THE DEPARTMENT DEFERENCE APARTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENT SAYS THAT CITIES ALREADY HER POWERS TO INTRODUCE CLEAN ZONES ANOTHER AIR QUALITY SCHEMES ARE YOU YOU'RE SAYING IT'S WHAT A LONG WAY SHORT OF WHAT'S REQUIRED YES AND ALSO I THINK IT'S GOT TO BE JOINED UP ACROSS GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS WELL AS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT MATE AS WELL AS DEAF BECAUSE DEAF OR HE'S GOT THE REMIT FOR AIR QUALITY BUT OF COURSE MUCH OF AND AS I SAID EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE OF THE POLLUTION IN THE HOTSPOTS IN CITIES IS CAUSED BY TRANSPORT AND CAUSED A LOT BY BY DIESEL ENGINES WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT FARMING AND THE AND AMMONIUM NITRATE AND AMMONIA THAT COMES OUT FROM SLURRY
THAT CAN BE USED TO GREATER AFFECT NOT ONLY TO STOP THE AIR QUITE A POLLUTION BUT ALSO TO CREATE BETTER CROPS AND A BETTER USE OF IT SO LEMON A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THIS QUESTION OF NITROGEN DIOXIDE DOCTOR HEATHER WALTON IS THAT THE THING IF YOU COULD REDUCE THAT THAT WOULD MAKE THE MOST DIFFERENCE TO LIFE EXPECTANCY
THAT NEEDS FULL AND ANALYSIS THE COMMITTEE ON MEDICAL OR PET THEY'RE POLLUTANTS IS PREPARING A REPORT AT THE MOMENT AND WHILE INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE WHEN THE FINAL RECOMMENDATION FOR MADE IN THE SUMMER WE CAN DO CALCULATIONS BUT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT LEVELS OF DARK SIDE ARE ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN LEVELS OF PARTICULATE MATTER SO IN THE BIG CITIES THEN THE IMPACT FROM NOTCH DARK SIDE
IT'S PROBABLY GREATER PARTICULATE MATTER WHAT'S IT WHAT SEEMS ODD HERE IS ALMOST A DISCONNECT TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WERE TALKING ABOUT UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DEATHS AND IF THEY DON'T THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SORT OF WIDESPREAD CONCERN I'M TALKING ABOUT AMONGST THE PEOPLE AND THEREFORE PERHAPS THEREFORE ON THE GOVERNMENT I KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY PEOPLE WHO'D SORT OF JUMP UP AND DOWN AND SAY LOOK IT'S WHAT BUT IT'S NOT WIDELY IT'S NOT A BIG CONCERN FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
I THINK IT SHOULD BE A GREATER CONCERN AND I ALSO THINK YOU I HAVE SOME SYMPATHY FOR DRIVERS WHO FOR YEARS NOW BEEN MOVED TOWARDS DIESEL CARS AND CLEANER DIESEL CARS BECAUSE OF CARBON AND NOW NATURALLY NITRIC OXIDE THAT CONVERTS INTO NITROGEN DIOXIDE IS THE PROBLEM SO I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A REAL REVERSAL
AND THERE ARE WHAT DO YOU MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE GIVE UP THEIR OWN THERE ARE GRANTS FOR HYBRID VEHICLES AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN PARTICULAR LIKES I THINK LINKED TO A SCRAPPAGE SCHEME FOR THE OLDER DIESELS AND THEN OF COURSE IT'S PEOPLE LIKE IT HAVING DELIVERY VANS BUILDERS ALL THESE TRACKS AT THAT COME IN THAT A DIESEL VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO CONVERT OVERNIGHT AND THERE'S HUGE CAST BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH
EVERYTHING IF WE ARE BECAUSE I REPEAT EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE POLLUTION IN THE HOTSPOTS IN INNER CITIES IS CAUSED BY FROM FROM VEHICLES AND SO THAT'S THE ISSUE WERE PARISH DOCTOR HEATHER WALTON THANK YOU
IT'S TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS A DAY AFTER A JURY RULED THAT NINETY SIX FOOTBALL FANS WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED AT HILLSBOROUGH THE SUN APOLOGISES ONCE AGAIN FOR ITS COVERAGE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE SUPPORTERS WERE NOT TO BLAME SAYS THE PAPER'S LEADER COLUMN THE POLICE MADE THEM WITH A PACK OF LIES WHICH THEIR SON AND OTHERS IN THE MEDIA SWALLOWED WHOLE
WE APOLOGISE THE PAPER SAYS PROMINENTLY TWELVE YEARS AGO AGAIN FOUR YEARS AGO ON THE FRONT PAGE AND DO SO UNRESERVEDLY AGAIN NOW THE PAPER COVERS THE STORY NOT ON THE FRONT COVER THERE BUT ON PAGE EIGHT OR NINE WITH THEIR HEADLINE JUSTICE TWENTY SEVEN YEARS ON THE HEADLINE IN THE METRO IS THE TRUTH A DELIBERATE ECHO OF THE SUN'S INFAMOUS FRONT PAGE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE LAYOUT TO IS THE SAME
THE BISHOP OF LEEDS NICK BAINES HE WAS BORN IN LIVERPOOL RIGHT IN THE YORKSHIRE POST IT IS A FATAL ERROR EVER TO ACCUSE YORKSHIRE PEOPLE OR LIVERPUDLIANS HAVE SENTIMENTAL ISM HE WRITES BUT THE SHARED EXPERIENCE OF THIS GRIEF AND ANGER HAS CONSTRUCTED A BOND THAT GENERATES MUTUAL RESPECT THE LIVERPOOL ECHO DEVOTES THIRTY SEVEN PAGES TO THE INQUESTS ON THE FRONT PAGE WAS A PICTURE OF SAINT GEORGE'S HALL WITH THE WORDS TRUTH AND JUSTICE SPELLED OUT AMID THE COLUMNS
HEROES FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE AND AT LAST A CITY IS VINDICATED SAYS THE PAPER NOW THE PRESSURE MOUNTS ON THE COWARDS AND THE LIARS THE LEADER COLUMN IN THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS THERE WAS A MONSTROUS ESTABLISHMENT CONSPIRACY WHICH MUST LEAD TO CRIMINAL CHARGES THE DAILY TELEGRAPH TO SAYS IT'S TIME FOR JUSTICE
BUT THE DAILY MAIL IS MORE CAUTIOUS THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE MUST DECIDE WHETHER THE PUBLIC INTEREST CAN BE SERVED AFTER SO MANY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED BY BRINGING CHARGES AGAINST LONG RETIRED ELDERLY POLICE OFFICERS IT SAYS IT IS AN IMMENSELY DIFFICULT JUDGEMENT
THE MIRROR SPEAKS TO SIR PHILIP GREEN HAS BEEN CRITICISED SINCE HIS FORMER BUSINESS B.H.S. WENT INTO ADMINISTRATION THE PAPER SIR PHILIP WHETHER IT WAS RIGHT TO SPEND ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS ON A YACHT WHILE THOUSANDS OF HIS FORMER EMPLOYEES FACE REDUNDANCY SO PHILIP REPORTEDLY REPLIES I CAN BUY WHAT I LIKE WITH MY MONEY IT'S MY MONEY THE SAYS SIR PHILIP HAS A RUTHLESS LOVE OF MAKING MONEY CALLING HIM THE WOLF OF HIGH STREET
IN THE DAILY MAIL SARAH VINE CLAIMS B.H.S. WAS ASSET STRIPPED IN A BARELY BELIEVABLE WAY THE KIND OF CORPORATE RAPE YOU MIGHT EXPECT IN A WALL STREET BLOCKBUSTER SHE CONCLUDES IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT MAKES EVEN A HOARY OLD TORY SUCH AS ME CONTEMPLATE SOCIALISM
SIR PHILIP DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE MAYOR TO THE MALE OR THE SUN FINALLY THE TIMES REPORTS ON A GROUP OF RESIDENTS IN USHER MORE IN COUNTY DURHAM WHO ARE KEEPING THEIR NEIGHBOURS UP WITH ALL MIGHT SCREECHING WANTON VANDALISM AND OUTRAGEOUS IN DECENCY

IT IS TIME OF COURSE FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
I'M SO SORRY I DO APOLOGISE WE'RE MOVING ONTO ANOTHER DISCUSSION OF HILLSBOROUGH OF COURSE BECAUSE ON THAT DAY AT HILLSBOROUGH THE VOICES WHO NORMALLY BROUGHT AS NEWS OF THE LATEST GOAL BECAME INSTEAD THOSE WHO TOLD US ABOUT ANOTHER DEATH FOOTBALL COMMENTATORS WERE FORCED TO BECOME REPORTERS AT THE SCENE OF AN OLD UNFOLDING DISASTER
ALONGSIDE THE LATE GREAT PETER JONES WHOSE VOICE WE HEARD SO OFTEN YESTERDAY WAS ALAN GREEN HE JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW MORNING TO YOU ALAN GOOD MORNING
IT WAS A HUGELY EMOTIONAL DAY YESTERDAY FOR THEIR FAMILIES THEIR FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE IN LIVERPOOL WAS IT FOR YOU AS SOMEONE WHO WITNESSED IT
UNQUESTIONABLY YES I I WATCHED THE UNFOLDING EVENTS OF WARRINGTON THROUGH THE B.B.C. NEWS CHANNEL
AND WHEN IT CAME TO GIVING THE VERDICTS
ON THE INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS ARE FOURTEEN QUESTIONS I KNEW I KNEW HOW PIVOT OR QUESTION SIX AND QUESTION CERTAIN WOULD BE TO THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE SHOWN EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH PERSISTENCE AND DIGNITY THROUGH TWENTY SEVEN HORRIBLE YEARS AND WHAT I HEARD
THE ANSWER TO QUESTION SIX ABOUT UNLAWFUL KILLING I CRIED I CRIED WITH
RELIEF ON THEIR BEHALF AND YET THERE WAS MIXED IN WITH THAT ANGER AND I'LL GET TO THE ANGER IN A MOMENT BUT ALSO GUILT
BECAUSE THE GUY I WAS ONLY THERE IN WORKING CAPACITY I DIDN'T LOSE ANY OIL NO I DIDN'T LOSE MY FATHER MY BROTHER MY SON MY DAUGHTER WHY SHOULD I FEEL EMOTIONALLY BIND UP IN HILLSBOROUGH AND PARTICULARLY ALL THESE YEARS LONG WELL FOR ME AND I ARE CONSTANTLY THINK ABOUT THIS IT'S WHAT I EXPERIENCED ON THE DAY
THE DIGNITY OF THE FOUNDRY THEY WERE TRYING TO HELP LOAD BODIES ON TO MAKE SURE
STRETCHES BROKEN UP ADVERTISMENT HOARDINGS WHEN I SAW POLICE STANDING AROUND DOING NOTHING
I WAS SHOCKED AT THE OTHER CHAOS ON THE RESPONSE OF THE AUTHORITIES THE POLICE AND THE AMBULANCE AND I I REMEMBER INTERVIEWING GROW TERRI LEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION I HOLD IN THE HIGHEST REGARD AND HE WAS CRYING AND SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THE MOUNTING DEATH TOLL
I SAID GRAHAM WHAT'S HAPPENED WHAT IS HAPPENING TO YOU
AND HE SAID AND THE POLICE TELL ME THAT THE FIRE IRONS
BROKE DOWN THE GATE TO GET AND DIG INTO THE GRANT I WASN'T TO KNOW DAN THE THAT WAS A LIE
BUT IT BECAME OBVIOUS LATER AND IT WAS CRUCIAL IN THE CRUCIAL IN THE INQUEST WASN'T IT THAT INTERVIEW WITH THAT LOT I BECAME IMPORTANT IN THE INQUEST WAS THAT WAS THE START OF THE COVER
IT BEGAN ON THE DAY AND EVEN WITH MY VERY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES IT CONTINUED WITHIN A FEW WEEKS I WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE WEST MIDLANDS POLICE IN SHEFFIELD THEY'D BEEN THERE TO INVESTIGATE THE TRAGEDY
AND THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW I COULD SENSE THAT MY JOURNALISTIC INSTINCT SENSED THAT THEY WEREN'T INTERESTED IN WHAT I HAD TO SAY
AND A QUARTER OF A CENTURY ON NICK I WAS ALSO INTERVIEWED BY POLICE AT WARRINGTON WHO ACTUALLY PRODUCED THE RECORD OF THAT INTERVIEW
ALL THOSE YEARS ON AND ALL OF THOSE INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED BY THE WEST MIDLANDS POLICE WERE GRADE IT IN AND CALLED COLDER QUALITY DE VIABILITY WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE FOLLOWED UP AND THE MORNING TO POLICE SAID TO ME
WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WEREN'T INTERVIEWED AGAIN YOU WERE SOMEONE IN OTHER WORDS WHOSE EVIDENCE SHOULD REALLY HAVE MATTERED BUT THEY'D CHOSEN TO IGNORE DIG HOW SOON ALAN DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT WHAT YOU'D BEEN TOLD WHAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE POLICE WAS SIMPLY NOT TRUE WELL I SHOULD BEGAN WITH THE SUN
THE LITANY OF LIES THAT I KNEW FROM
MY QUERIES BUT THEY WERE JUST TOW IT TOTALLY UNTRUE WHAT WAS SAID THAT DAY BY KELVIN MACKENZIE NAS COOL WHAT'S THE CLAIM IN OTHER WORDS AT THE FANS HAD ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT ON THEMSELVES OR BECAUSE OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR WHICH IT WHICH IS WHY THE TO DO TO POINT SEVEN
IN THE VERDICT WAS AS IMPORTANT TO THE FAMILY JUST POINT SIXTY UNLAWFUL KILLING POINT SEVEN SAID THE FINDS WERE EXONERATED THEY DID NOTHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY YOU PER STAINS LINGER THE STAINS LINGER
NICK I'VE BEEN VERY PRIVILEGED OVER THIRTY YEARS HAD TO COMMENTATE ON MAJOR GAMES AND MANY OF THOSE MAJOR GAME TO HAVE INVOLVED LIVERPOOL PLAYING MANCHESTER UNITED
IN RECENT YEARS IN PARTICULAR I ALWAYS DREAD BEING ASKED TO DO THOSE GAMES AND THE REASON HE'S HERE WE ARE THE TWO MOST SUCCESSFUL CLUBS IN ENGLISH FOOTBALL HISTORY WITH A FIERCE RIVALRY THAT GOES BEYOND THEIR CITY RIVALRIES OF LIVERPOOL AGAINST EVERTON AND MANCHESTER UNITED AGAINST MANCHESTER CITY BUT
OH I HEAR A CHANCE ABOUT HILLSBOROUGH AND MUNICH
THEN MANY OF THE GUILTY MORALS ARE TOO YOUNG TO HAVE BEEN ALIVE IN THOSE TERRIBLE EVENTS HAPPENED CAN THEY NOW PLEASE STOP MAYBE DON'T UNDERSTAND STOMP
MAYBE THEY WILL UNDERSTAND NOW IT'S VERY VERY CLEAR LISTENING TO YOU THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE AN EMOTIONAL IMPACT ON YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES AND INDEED YOUR ADVICE THERE
IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN THE LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING'S A REBEL DOCTOR JUDD'S FRASER HIS PRISON CHARGE OF SAINT MARY NEWINGTON GOOD MORNING JUDGE MORNING SIR AS WE'VE JUST BEEN HEARING THEY SAID IT WAS THE TRUTH IN BIG BOLD CAPITAL LETTERS RIGHT ACROSS THE FRONT PAGE AND ACCORDING TO THE SUN THE TRUTH WAS THIS SOME FANS PICK THE POCKETS OF VICTIMS SOME FANS URINATED ON THE BRAVE COPS
ALL TOTAL RUBBISH OF COURSE AND LATER THE SUN APOLOGISED BUT THEY WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES TO GET IT SO VERY BADLY WRONG
SAINT MATTHEW'S GOSPEL HAS IT THUS IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT BLESSED ARE YOU WHEN PEOPLE INSULT YOU PERSECUTE YOU AND FALSELY SAY ALL KINDS OF EVIL AGAINST YOU
WE HAVE ANOTHER PHRASE FOR IT NOW THE VICTIM BLAMING
IT'S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO DIED AT HILLSBOROUGH WHISPERS LETTINGS LANE TERRACE ON THE FIFTEENTH OF APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE INDEED INCLUDED THE LONGEST JURY PROCEEDING IN BRITISH LEGAL HISTORY AND OVER ALL THESE YEARS LAYERS OF LIES AN OFFICIAL COVER UP HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY DISCOVERED AND DISCARDED
A FEW DAYS AFTER THE TRAGEDY IN SHEFFIELD CATHEDRAL DOCTOR JOHN HAD GOOD THEN THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK SAID THIS IN HIS SERMON THE TRUTH WILL OUT AND WHAT KIND OF TRUTH WILL IT BE
NOW WE KNOW THAT MANY LIVES COULD'VE BEEN SAVED IF IT WASN'T FOR FAILURES BY THE POLICE IN CHARGE WHO MISMANAGED TO DANGEROUS CRUSH WE NOW KNOW THAT SOME POLICE ALSO WITHHELD EVIDENCE AMENDED STATEMENTS I'M TOLD LIES ABOUT THEIR SUPPORTERS TRYING TO CAST THEM IN THE ROLE OF DRUNKEN HOOLIGANS
THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS IS THE NINTH OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IT'S ONE OF THE FOUNDATION STONES OF MORAL CIVILISATION IN THE DUE DAY A CHRISTIAN TRADITION AND IT TOOK DECADES OF STRUGGLE BY THE FAMILIES OF THE HILLSBOROUGH VICTIMS FOR THE TRUTH TO BE OFFICIALLY TOLD
EXONERATING THE FANS AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR ON THAT TERRIBLE DAY I WOULD THIS TIME MANY HURT HILLSBOROUGH FAMILIES REFUSED TO ACCEPT DEATH CERTIFICATES THAT INCLUDED THE MISLEADING DESCRIPTION ACCIDENTAL DEATH
NOW HOWEVER WE CAN PUBLICLY BEAR WITNESS TO THE TRUTH IT WAS UNLAWFUL KILLING AND THE SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY HAILING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SAY AS MUCH
BACK IN JANUARY THE HILLSBOROUGH FAMILIES UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THAT THE FIFTEENTH OF THIS MONTH WAS TO BE THE FINAL HILLSBOROUGH MEMORIAL SERVICE AND FAILED THEY ALL SANG ABOUT ABIDE WITH ME AND FORMER EVERTON STRIKER GRAHAM SHARPE READ FROM THE TWENTY THIRD PSALM THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH THOU ART WITH ME
WHICH IS I GUESS MORE EXPLICITLY RELIGIOUS VERSION OF LIVERPOOL'S FAVOURITE ANTHEM YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE WHICH THEY ALSO SANG
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MOVING ON AS IF IT WERE THAT EASY IT'S NOT BUT GRIEF DOES HAVE ITS STAGES AND GETTING TO THE TRUTH IS ONE OF THEM AND ACHIEVING JUSTICE IS ANOTHER
THOUGH PERHAPS EFFICIENT FOR TODAY'S THIS NINETY SIX PEOPLE WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DAY AND MAY THEY WILL REST IN PEACE
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REV AND DOCTOR GILES FRASER IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT IS THIS THE YEAR THE JOB IS FINALLY OVER FOR THE U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY THE MOMENT IT CAN CLAIM VICTORY IN HIS BATTLE TO FREE THE COUNTRY FROM THE CLUTCHES OF BRUSSELS OR HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN AND THEY'VE CHOSEN TO STAY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN CLUB OR IS UKIP WHICH OF COURSE IS FIGHTING COUNCIL WELSH ASSEMBLY IN SCOTTISH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN JUST A FEW WEEKS' TIME HERE TO STAY
WHATEVER THE RESULTS OF THE REFERENDUM WE'RE JOINED BY UKIP'S LEADER NIGEL FARRELL WHO JOINS US LIVE FROM CARDIFF MORNING TO YOU MY BARRAGE GOOD MORNING PEOPLE HAVE A REFERENDUM THE PEOPLE WILL DECIDE SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF VOTING UKIP IN ANY OTHER ELECTION WELL THEY WILL DECIDE ON JUNE TWENTY THIRD YOU QUITE RIGHT HOWEVER ON MAY THE FIFTH
AS YOU SAID IN YOUR INTRODUCTION WHERE FIGHTING THE WELSH ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS A SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS WITH FIGHTING SEATS IN NORTHERN IRELAND FOR STORM AND WE'RE FIGHTING THE LONDON MAYOR LONDON ASSEMBLY ONE AND A HALF THOUSAND COUNCIL SEATS WE'VE GOT THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE STANDING AS POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONERS SO IT'S
IT'S RATHER LIKE A BRITISH SUPER TUESDAY ISN'T IT RECTALLY IT'S REMARKABLE WHAT IS THE POINT THOUGH PEOPLE MIGHT THINK WILL LOOK I USED TO THAT YOU COULD IF THEY DID TO SEND A MESSAGE AS IT WERE BUT WE'VE MOVED WAY BEYOND PEOPLE VOTING UKIP AS A PROTEST OR TO SEND THE MESSAGE OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A VERY STRONG CONSOLIDATION OF THE UKIP VOTE WHERE PEOPLE NOW
ONE OF EIGHT UKIP IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM OF ELECTION WE'VE MADE SOME BIG ADVANCES IN COUNCILS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS I DO ANTICIPATE MORE OF THAT ON MAY THE FIFTH BUT FOR ME THE BIG GOAL ON MAY THE FIFTH IS TO WIN REPRESENTATION IN THE LONDON ASSEMBLY THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT THE WELSH ASSEMBLY
THE NORTHERN IRISH ASSEMBLY AND I THINK I'M THE ONLY PARTY LEADER WHO'S GOT A CHANCE OF WINNING SEATS IN ALL FOUR OF THEM YOU SEE THE SUSPICION SOME PEOPLE HAVE IS THAT UKIP IS A CURIOUS COMBINATION OF A ONE MAN BAND YOU WERE OF COURSE OR MAYBE THIS ONE MAN IS CARRYING A SACK FULL OF FIGHTING FERRETS YOU'RE SPEAKING TO US FROM CARDIFF YOU'VE GOT PROMINENT CANDIDATES NEIL HAMILTON A MARK RECKLESS WHO ARE NOT FROM WALES AND YOU'VE GOT THE LEADER OF THE UKIP IN WALES WHO SAYS HE WOULDN'T HAVE CHOSEN THEM IF YOU'D HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO SO
WE PUT IT TO THE MEMBERS THE MEMBERS CHOSE SO YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT IF THAT'S WHAT PARTY DEMOCRACY COMES UP WITH NOT EVERYONE'S GOING TO LIKE THE RESULT BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS ARGUE WITH THAT YOU SAY THAT THE LEADER OF UKIP IN WALES HAS DONE PRECISELY THAT IS ARGUED WITH IT SAYS IT'S NOT A YOU WANT IT BUT I THOUGHT HE WANTED THAT UP TO HIM AS THAT BUT THE POINT IS THIS WE MAY HAVE
OR SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHO SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT BE CANDIDATES ARE WINNABLE POSITIONS BUT I LOOK AT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHICH IS LITERALLY RIPPING ITSELF TO PIECES AND THE LABOUR PARTY WHERE OVER EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE M.P.S DON'T WANT CORBETT AS LEADER I LOOK AT THEIR PROBLEMS I THINK WHAT I'VE GOT IS NOTHING
YOU SAY IT'S NOTHING BUT OF COURSE ONE OF YOUR MOST PROMINENT MEMBERS WELL IS SHE A MEMBER IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION ISN'T IT SUZANNE EVANS WANTED TO RUN AGAINST YOU FOR LEADER WAS A PROMINENT FIGURE ON TELEVISION AND RADIO SHE'S NOW BEEN SUSPENDED IT IT SOUNDS A GAME YOU CAN'T REALLY DEAL WITH THE COMPETITION
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME I'D I'M PARTY LEADER MAKE A TOUR OF THE COUNTRY I TRY AND RAISE MONEY I TRY AND GET THE CUP THEY PARTY COVERAGE I TRIED ENTHUSE THE TROOPS I DON'T DEAL WITH DISCIPLINE OR CANDIDATE SELECTION AND I NEVER HAVE DONE
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU I HAVE THINGS I HAVE NO INFLUENCE OVER WHAT THE BALTI DOES ZIP OH KAY WILL LET LET'S TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY NOW WHY DID YOU TAKE THE OPPORTUNE I WANT HER BACK SHE'S ONE OF OUR BEST BUT HIS PROMINENT VOICES WE NEED SHE'S A CONTRAST TO MAY WE DON'T GET ON BUT LET'S HAVE I DON'T THINK SHE BEHAVED TERRIBLY WELL SO YOU DON'T WANT TO
I DON'T IF YOU BEHAVED TERRIBLY WELL SHE SUSPENDED FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT FRANKLY BUT YOU'RE NOT THAT I'M JUST ASKING AS I SAY WE'VE GOT A MAY THE FIFTH UKIP IS GOING TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH INTO LOTS OF LEVELS OF PARLIAMENT AN ASSEMBLY TO WHICH WE'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE AND OFF THE BACK OF THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT A BIG STRONG CAMPAIGN IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM ON JUNE TWENTY THIRD I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THAT THE LEAF SIDE ACTUALLY GETS INTO THE OTHER HALF OF THE PITCH
AND STARTS TO CHALLENGE THE REMAIN SIDE ABOUT OPEN DOOR IMMIGRATION ABOUT THE FACT THE FIGURES THAT ABOUT THIS MORNING SAID WE'VE UNDERESTIMATED EASTERN EUROPE EASTERN EUROPEAN MIGRATION BY AT LEAST FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE'S ANOTHER FIGURES OUT THIS MORNING AS WELL YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THEM THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO OPERATION DEVELOPMENT THE EYRIE SEE DES SAYS BRECHT'S IT IS LIKE A TAX THAT IT WILL COS PEOPLE THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE MONTH'S SALARY BY TWENTY TWENTY I AM F.

LEONARDO ROCKER REPORTING IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT
THERE WERE SHRIEKS OF DELIGHT AND APPLAUSE IN THE CORONER'S COURT YESTERDAY WHEN THE JURY ANNOUNCED THEIR VERDICT IN THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST THEY WERE SINGING ON THE STEPS OUTSIDE BUT THEN THOSE CHEERING AND CLAPPING HAD BEEN WAITING TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TO HEAR THAT THEY WERE VINDICATED THAT THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS KILLED ALL THAT TIME BEFORE WERE UNLAWFULLY KILLED THAT THEY'VE BEEN ENTIRELY INNOCENT AND THAT THE POLICEMAN IN CHARGE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR MANSLAUGHTER BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE
DOCTOR DOROTHY GRIFFITHS LOST HER BROTHER VINCENT FITZSIMMONS IN THE DISASTER AND JOINS US FROM WREXHAM NOW AND WE'RE JOINED FROM THE STUDIO IN B.B.C. RADIO MERSEYSIDE BY BISHOP TOM WILLIAMS WHO'S NOW AUXILIARY BISHOP OF LIVERPOOL BUT HE WAS A PARISH PRIEST AT THAT TIME AND CONDUCTED SOME OF THE FUNERALS GOOD MORNING TO YOU ABOUT GOOD MOGGY COS NO NEED BISHOP WILLIAMS A COUNTRY IN A MOMENT THE DOCTOR GRIFFITHS FIRST OF ALL
AFTER SO LONG WHEN YOU HEARD THE VERDICTS YESTERDAY HOW DID YOU FEEL
JUST ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMED I COULDN'T I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT BECAUSE WE WAITED SO LONG AND THEY'VE BEEN SO MANY DIFFICULTIES ALONG THE WAY SO TO HEAR THAT EVERY YOU KNOW ALL OUR LOVED ONES HAVE BEEN VINDICATED WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC I KNOW YOU WERE IN THE CORONER'S COURT WAS IT WHAT YOU EXPECTED
THE RESULT NO IT WAS JUST JUICE JUST HOPE FOR THE BEST
AND YOU THINK OR YOU KNOW YOU'RE HOPING THAT IT WILL COME OUT IN A POSITIVE WAY FOR ALL OF US SO I WENT IN TRYING TO KEEP A BALANCE FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE TO BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST SO AND SO THAT THE RESULT WAS JUST WONDERFUL
WHAT DIFFERENCE DO YOU THINK IT WILL MAKE NOW TO THAT JUST TO THE WAY THAT I SUPPOSE THE WAY THAT YOU GO ABOUT YOUR LIFE
WELL FOR US SO LONG FOR FOR THEY'VE SPEAKING FROM A PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW I NEVER EVER REALLY KNEW WHAT HAPPENED TO VINCENT IN TERMS OF THE DAY
AND TRYING TO GRIEVE WHEN SOMETHING SO TERRIBLE AS THAT HAPPENS IS
TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT ANYWAY BUT WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS GOING ON AS THERE WAS AT THAT TIME ABOUT THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE FANS
AND THE GENERAL ATTITUDE SOMETIMES TOWARDS LIVERPOOL PEOPLE THAT WAS SO HARD AND IT WAS JUST LIKE AN OPEN WOUND THAT HAD JUST BEEN OVERTIME COVERED OVER BUT NEVER HEALED UP THANK YOU WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU NEVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED TO FENCE IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL YOU KNOW I'VE ACTUALLY HOW HE DIED AT WHAT TIME HE DIED AND HE WAS ONLY WHEN THE HIPPY FOR CAME OUT THAT THE DETAILS BEGAN TO EMERGE AND THEY REALISE THAT I ALWAYS WORRIED THAT
VINCENT HAD BEEN LEFT SOMEWHERE AND NO WONDER HAD FOUND HIM AND THEN WHEN THE HIP REPORT CAME OUT AND FOUND OUT THAT PEOPLE HAD HELPED HIM WHICH BROUGHT SO MUCH COMFORT TO ME O.K. I WAS ABLE TO MEET THOSE PEOPLE AND THANK THEM PERSONALLY AND PITS THE HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY PANEL OF COURSE YES YES BUT
IT'S NOT JUST THE OUTCOME AND THE RESPONSIBILITY WAS ALSO JUST THE DETAILS OF THAT DAY WHICH YOU DIDN'T KNOW AT FOR YEARS
SO WE WERE JUST TOLD THAT THEY ALL DIED AND AND IT WAS IMPORTANT AS FOR ANY GRIEF GRIEVING PERSON TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEIR LOVED ONE
WAS ANYONE THERE TO HELP THEM THOUGH THE ACTUAL DETAILS AS PART OF THE GRIEF PROCESS AND HE'S HIS SON YOUR NEPHEW WAS NINE WHEN IT'S
YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT THE ATTITUDE TO LIVERPOOL CHAP WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT I THINK AROUND THAT TIME THEY WERE VERY NEGATIVE ATTITUDES ABOUT FANS IN BITS YOU KNOW IN IN GENERAL LIVE FOOTBALL FAN
BUT AGAIN I WORKED OUTSIDE LIVERPOOL AND WHEN I WOULD HEAR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OH WE KNOW WHAT DO YOU EXPECT AS LIVERPOOL FANS THE HOOLIGANS LIVERPOOL PEOPLE AND THAT WAS VERY VERY HARD AND DISTRESSING TO HERE
WE HEARD GREEN EARLIER TALKING ABOUT HOW EVEN NOW HE DREADS FOR EXAMPLE A LIVERPOOL VERSUS MANCHESTER UNITED YES IS THAT SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS YOU TOO YES IT WAS I JUST I JUST TRY TO SWITCH OFF AND
IN THE JOB I WAS DOING I WOULD GO ROUND AND VISIT PEOPLE YOU KNOW IN THEIR HOMES AND IF THEY HAD THE T.V. ON AND ANYTHING CAME OFF ABOUT FOOTBALL LIKE THAT MY HEART WOULD SINK YOU'D FEEL PHYSICALLY SICK IN CASE THAT IS THE ISSUE OF HILLSBOROUGH CAME UP
BECAUSE I FOUND IT DISTRESSING TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE YOU WERE WHAT WORRIED ABOUT WHAT SOMEBODY WOULD SAY YES YES I HAVE HEARD THINGS SAID ON THE PHONE I FOUND IT TERRIBLY EMOTIONAL
COS WHEN YOU DO YOU THINK ABOUT SOMEONE YOU LOVE WHEN YOU'VE LOST THAT'S HARD ENOUGH BUT
PEOPLE TALKING GENERALLY ABOUT OH WELL THAT'S WHAT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT HE'S JUST IT JUST TERRIBLE AND I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER GET OVER IT
BUT THE DECISION YESTERDAY THAT SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO ALL OF THE FAMILIES TO OUR LOVED ONES AND TO LIVERPOOL WE CAN HOLD OUR HEAD UP HIGH
DOCTOR DOROTHY BREAKFAST DO STAY WITH US BUT LET'S TURN NOW TO BISHOP TOM WILLIAMS AND FOR YOU WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE BECAUSE YOU OF COURSE I MEAN AT THE TIME I THINK IT WAS A QUOTE OF YOURS THAT ENDED UP AS THE HEADLINE IN THE INDEPENDENT
YES THE QUOTE WAS SIMPLY SAYING WE WILL DEAL WITH THIS WE AS THE HE WILL BE ABLE TO COPE
THAT WAS THE THAT WAS JUST THE OFF THE CUFF COMMENT I MADE ON THE SAME NIGHT AND ENDED UP AT THE HEADLINE WAS IT TRUE AND I THINK WE HAVE BEEN COPING WITH THEIRS AND VARIOUS WAYS AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A GROUP
I THINK WHAT THE DOCTOR WAS JUST SAID BEFORE SUMS IT UP PERFECTLY I THINK CHEF THE IDEA THAT IT WASN'T INDIVIDUALS IN DIED THAT IT WAS A GROUP IT WAS LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS AND I THINK WHAT THE INQUEST AS DONE HAS TO
TO MAKE IT PERSONAL IT'S ALWAYS HAS BEEN PERSONAL TO US BUT IT'S MADE TO PERSONAL BECAUSE EACH PERSON HAD THEIR OWN STORY TO TELL WHETHER THEY'RE THE WAY THEY WERE TREATED THE WAY IT WENT TILL DEALT WITH THE WAY THE WHOLE SITUATION DEVELOPED I MEAN MY FIRST
I FIRST THOUGHT YESTERDAY WAS A HUNGER TO BE QUITE HONEST BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT'S TAKEN TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS FOR THE TRUTH TO COME OUT AND THERE'S BEEN LIES OR DECEIT IT'S BEEN ORGANISED THAT'S WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE MESSAGE SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE COPED VERY WELL AS A CITY BUT I THINK WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID BEFORE SOME TO LOOK PERFECTLY
YOU ARE THE POSITION THAT YOU HOLD THAT AS A RELIGIOUS LEADER YOU MUST TALK ABOUT FORGIVENESS DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU FORGIVE THOSE
YES I THINK HER FORGIVENESS IS AN IMPORTANT THING I THINK WE WOULD USE THE WORD MASS EVEN FORGIVE US BUT I THINK AS I WAS SAYING TO ONE OF OUR CHURCH LEADS AS YESTERDAY MERCY IS ABOUT EMBRACING WHAT YOU'VE DONE WRONG
AND ACCEPTING IT AND THEN ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS SO I THINK ON THE PART OF THE AUTHORITIES
THEN THEY MADE THEIR APOLOGIES IF THEY REALLY MEANT IT BUT THAT'S THE START I THINK WE'VE GOT TO WORK WITH THEM AS WELL AS WE WALKED WITH THE VICTIM THE SUPPORTERS ON THE FANS SO IT IS CRITICAL WHAT HAPPENED NEXT IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK IT'S CHAPTER TWO
YOU TALK ABOUT ANGER WAS YESTERDAY AN EMOTIONAL DAY FOR YOU AND EXTREMELY SO I THINK I FELT THERE MUST SOMEWHERE IS MORE EMOTIONAL YESTERDAY THAN I DID AT THE TIME
UM I SUPPOSE IT STUCK SORT OF FATHER YOU GET IN THE TUBE AND HE DOES IT'S COMBINED WHAT RELIEF I AM JUST AS SOMEONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEING VINDICATED I THINK FOR THE FAMILIES HAVE WALKED WITH THEM AND I'VE BEEN WITH MANY OF THEM AND I THINK IT'S
COS THAT'S ALL GOT VERY PERSONAL STORIES TO TELL AND THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL THEY REALLY HAVE THERE BEEN THROUGH AN AWFUL AWFUL TERRIBLE SITUATION
DOROTHY GRIFFITHS CAN I JUST COME BACK TO YOU ON THAT QUESTION OF WHAT NOW IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT THERE ARE PROSECUTIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW FAIRLY WELL WHO ARE ELDERLY
YES I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AND I AGREE IT IS CHAPTER TWO FOR ME PERSONALLY I FEEL NOW AT LAST I CAN PROPERLY GRIEF OF INSTANT AND MOVE ALONG WITH MY LIFE AND OUR FAMILY'S LIFE
AND FOR HIS SON WHO WAS OF COURSE ONLY NINE AT THE TIME WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE TO HIM WELL I GET I GUESS AS WELL FOR HIM HE'LL BE ABLE TO GRIEVE PROPERLY FOR HIS DAD AND TWO TO MOVE ON WITH HIS LIFE HE'S ONLY YOUNG HE'S GOT HIS WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF HIM YOU KNOW HE'S NOW THE SAME AGE AS AS WHAT FOR YSTAD WAS WHEN HE DIED SO HE'S GOT A WHOLE LIFE TO LIVE
WE ALL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON WE'LL NEVER EVER FORGET AND THEY'LL ALWAYS BE WITH US BUT WE DO HAVE TO MOVE ON COS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS THIS FAR TOO LONG
THE TOLL IT'S TAKEN ON ALL OF US DOROTHY GRIFFITHS BISHOP TOM WILLIAMS THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU
NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT WILL THE TRUTH MAY NOW HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND DOUBT THERE ARE THOSE AS WE'VE BEEN HERE HE WHO WANT TO MOVE ON BUT PLENTY WHO WANT TO SEE JUSTICE DONE WHO BELIEVED THAT THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE HAVE NOT BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE
SO NOW THE INQUESTS ARE OVER WHAT ARE THE LEGAL AVENUES OPEN TO THOSE WHO WANT TO PURSUE THOSE THAT THEY BLAME FOR THE DEATHS OF THE NINETY SIX WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY LORD MACDONALD THE LABOUR PEER AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS BUT FIRST A WORD WITH OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT CLIVE COLEMAN LONG BEFORE CLIVE WE GET TO ANY PROSECUTIONS IF WE EVER DO THERE ARE TWO BIG INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE POLICE STILL ONGOING
THERE ARE LET ME JUST BEGIN BY SAYING THIS SNAKE THAT WHEN YOU GET AN UNLAWFUL KILLING CONCLUSION AT AN INQUEST THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE OBLIGATION ON THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE TO PROSECUTE BUT THERE IS A HIGHER LEVEL OF EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL THAT IS ENSHRINED IN CASE LAW AND PROSECUTORS ARE REFER SPECIFICALLY TO IT AS YOU SAY WHERE ARE WE WE'VE GOT TO CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS ONE
OPERATION RESOLVE IS LOOKING AT THE ACTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL OFFICES IN THE LEAD UP TO THE MATCH DAY AND ON THE MATCH DAY ITSELF SO IT IS LOOKING AT POTENTIAL CHARGES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE MANSLAUGHTER AND PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE AND VARIOUS OFFENCES UNDER HEALTH AND SAFETY AS WELL
THAT'S OPERATION RESOLVE A HUGE INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BEEN FEEDING INTO THE INQUEST IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BY THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION THAT IS LOOKING INTO THE ALLEGATIONS OF COVER UP IT'S LOOKING INTO ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY'RE ARE AMENDMENTS TO POLICE ACCOUNT'S ALLEGATIONS THAT MISLEADING INFORMATION WAS PASSED TO THE MEDIA EM PEAS AND PARLIAMENT AMONGST OTHERS WHAT WAYS MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE D.P.P.
INDEED BECAUSE FULL FILES HAVE TO BE PASSED TO THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE WE'RE TOLD THAT MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE BUT MUCH MORE IS STILL TO BE DONE FORGIVE ME TRYING TO BRING IN LORD MACDONALD NOW KEN MACDONALD AS WAS OF COURSE LABOUR PEER AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS
THAT IS THE BACKGROUND LAW MACDONALD WHAT WOULD YOUR SUCCESSOR THERE AT THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE WHAT WILL THEY BE WEIGHING UP AS THEY DECIDE WHETHER PROSECUTION'S CAN AND SHOULD BE BROUGHT WELL
TO STAGE TEST AT THE PROSECUTOR HAS TO APPLY WHEN HE OR SHE IS CONSIDERING THE EVIDENCE FIRST OF ALL DOES THE EVIDENCE PRESENT A REALISTIC PROSPECT OF CONVICTION AND THAT SIMPLY MEANS IS A COURT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO CONVICT A FIFTY ONE PER CENT CHANCE IS SUFFICIENT AND IF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS YES THERE IS A REALISTIC PROSPECT OF CONVICTION THE SECOND QUESTION IS WOULD THE PROSECUTION'S BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN CLEARLY THESE PROSECUTIONS WERE OVERWHELMINGLY BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST
QUESTION FOR THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE WHEN THEY RECEIVE THESE FILES OF MATERIAL IS GOING TO BE IT IS A CONVICTION MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IN THIS CASE WHAT ABOUT THE EVIDENCE IF THE ANSWER IS YES THEN CHARGES WILL BE AUTHORISED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CHARGES YOU IF IT HAPPENED NOW WOULD BE THE POSSIBILITY OF A CORPORATE MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE BUT BECAUSE WHEN IT HAPPENED THERE IS NOT THAT POSSIBILITY YES BUT THEY'RE STILL THE POSSIBILITY I THINK WHICH THE PROSECUTOR BE LOOKING OUT FOR BRINGING PROSECUTIONS FOR
GROSS NEGLIGENCE MANSLAUGHTER UNDER THE OLD LAW AND INDEED SUE HEMMING THE HEAD OF THE COUNTER TERRORISM SPECIAL CRIME DIVISION IN IN THE C.P.S. ARE SPECIFICALLY AN ALLUDED TO THAT POSSIBILITY I THINK THAT THE THE PROSECUTION WILL BE FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON INDIVIDUALS AND OF COURSE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY EVIDENCE WHICH HAS COME TO LIGHT
IN THE INQUEST SO ONE IS LOOKING AT A GROSS NEGLIGENCE MANSLAUGHTER PERVERSIONS OF THE COURSE OF JUSTICE PERJURY MISCONDUCT IN A PUBLIC OFFICE ALL EXTREMELY SERIOUS OFFENCES AND A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO BE LOOKED AT THE WE TOLD FILES WILL BE WITH THE POLICE WITH THE C.P.S.
BY THE END OF THE YEAR IN THE I.P.C.C. IS INDICATING THAT IT HAS INFORMATION FROM THE C.P.S. THAT THEY'LL TAKE FOUR TO SIX MONTHS TO LOOK AT THIS SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT A DECISION IN ANY TIME I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT WITHIN A YEAR BUT I THINK ALL PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS WILL BE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE GREAT PUBLIC INTEREST IN THIS BEING BROUGHT TO A CONCLUSION AS SPEEDILY AS IS CONSISTENT WITH JUSTICE
AND THERE MAY BE PEOPLE ARE PUZZLED BY THIS THAT THEY THINK WILL DIDN'T A JURY YESTERDAY TELL US THESE DEATHS WERE UNLAWFUL BUT THERE IS ANOTHER QUITE DIFFICULT PROCESS TO GO THROUGH ISN'T THERE MORE LEGAL HURDLES AS IT WERE TO BE JUMPED YES FIRST OF ALL THERE HIS IS A STAIGH A PROSECUTION AGAINST CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHICH THE PROSECUTION WOULD HAVE TO SEEK TOO
TO LIFT SECONDLY CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS HAVE TO BE PROVED TO A HIGHER STANDARD THEY HAD TO BE PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT SO IT'S A MUCH TOUGHER HURDLE FOR THE PROSECUTION TO PASS AND RIGHTLY SO WE SHOULDN'T HAVE CONVICTIONS IN THE UNDER OUR SYSTEM AND IF THERE'S DOUBT ABOUT THE GUILT OF THOSE INVOLVED SO THE PROSECUTION HAVE TO
HAVE TO SURPASS REASONABLE DOUBT THEY HAVE TO PERSUADE A JURY SO THAT THE JURY ARE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS OR INSTITUTIONS ARE GUILTY AND THAT'S A TOUGHER HURDLE A HIGHER STANDARD OF PROOF THEN THE INQUEST JURY WERE CONSIDERING A BRIEF I WANT IF YOU WERE DO YOU SPENT YOUR LIFE YOUR CAREER WORKING WITH THE POLICE LOOKING WHAT THE POLICE DID NEVERTHELESS DID YOU FIND YOURSELF SHOCKED BY WHAT THIS REVEALED
WE WERE LOOKING AT THE POLICE BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES I'M NOT SUGGESTING FOR A MOMENT THAT THIS EVERYTHING IS PERFECT NOW BUT THE POLICE IN THOSE DAYS WERE REGIMENTED CLOSE PROTECTED FROM SCRUTINY NOT SUFFICIENTLY CHALLENGED BY THE COURTS OR BY THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT I THINK WE HAD A FRANK A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POLICE NOW I THINK WE'RE HAVING A GLIMPSE IN THIS CASE
QUITE HOW BAD THINGS WERE IN THOSE DAYS AND I REMEMBER PRACTISING AS A YOUNG DEFENCE LAWYER IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE DEGREE OF IMPUNITY REALLY THAT THE POLICE HAD NOT CHALLENGED NOT SCRUTINISE CLOSED REGIMENTED WE ARE SOME WAY FROM THAT BUT WE HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY ON OUR GUARDS WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE GREAT SCRUTINISING AGENCIES OF SOCIETY AREN'T WORKING AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SCRUTINY DOES WORK LOW MADONNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED YOU ARE OF COURSE A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PEER FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING YOU WERE A MEMBER OF THE LABOUR PARTY

NO RESCUE DEAL WAS GOING TO BE FORTHCOMING THAT MONEY WAS BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE COMPANY AND TRANSFERRED OVER WHICH LOOK COST A VERY SORT OF MURKY LIGHT ON DEALINGS THERE AND SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED OF THE CONDUCT OF THE CONSORTIUM OF COURT AS DOMINIC SHEP ARE ALSO CLAIMS THAT A KEY LONER SIXTY MILLION WHICH WAS CRUCIAL TO THE RESCUE OF THE COMPANY DIDN'T HAPPEN
BECAUSE SIR PHILIP GREEN REFUSED TO LET HIS I.O.U. HE'S AN EXISTING IDEA YOU HE HAD WITH THE COMPANY PLAY SECOND FIDDLE TO THIS NEW LAID NOW THE COMPANY ALSO REFUSE THAT SAYING THE REASON ALONE DIDN'T WORK WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY FRYER HIGH UPFRONT COSTS AND IT WASN'T ACCEPTABLE ANYWAY SO LOTS OF QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED
OF SIR PHILIP GREEN HIMSELF OF COURSE WHO HAS BEEN ASKED TO APPEAR BEFORE A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S TO LOOK AT HIS ROLE IN THE DOWNFALL OF B.H.S. SO QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED BOTH OF THESE PREVIOUS OWNERS THE BETTER NEWS IS THAT I'VE LEARNED THAT THE ADMINISTRATORS HAVE HAD INTERESTS FIFTY EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR SOME OR ALL OF THE PARTS OF THE BUSINESS
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT YESTERDAY WAS A B.H.S. IS BEST TRADING DAY SINCE IT WAS BOUGHT BY THE BY THE ACQUIRE AND IN TRADING WAS EIGHTY PERCENT UP ON THE SAME DAY LAST YEAR SO IT SEEMS AT THE IMPENDING DEMISE OF B.H.S.

TRIATHLON I HAVE TO SAY I'VE ALWAYS FELT VERY LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN IN A SPORT THAT'S INCREDIBLY EQUAL WE'RE A VERY NEW SPORT WE'VE NOT LONG BEEN IN THE OLYMPICS ANY SINCE TWO THOUSAND THAT WE'VE BEEN AN OLYMPIC SPORT

AS DAYS TO CHANGE ITS PRICE PROMOTIONS AFTER THE COMPANY WAS SINGLED OUT BY THE COMPETITION REGULATOR IN A PRO INTO SUPERMARKET PRICING PRACTICES THE COMPETITION OF MARKETS AUTHORITY LAUNCHED AN INQUIRY LAST YEAR IN RESPONSE TO A SUPER COMPLAINT FROM THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH
A SECOND ALL OUT STRIKE BY JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND HAS BEGUN THE MEDICS ARE IN DISPUTE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OVER THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW CONTRACT N.H.S. LEADERS HAVE URGED PATIENTS TO USE SERVICES WISELY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NELL IT IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TONIGHT AND IT'S BEEN ANOTHER INTERESTING WEEK IN THE STORY OF THOSE EVERYDAY FOLK WHO JUST HAPPENED TO BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY THE JUSTICE SECRETARY SETS THE HEALTH SECRETARY COULD PAY JUNIOR DOCTORS MORE IF ONLY WE GOT OUT OF THE E. U. THE HOME SECRETARY DISAGREES SHE WANTS TO STAY IN THE E.U. BUT SHE WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT SHE WANTS TO GET OUT OF THE E.C.
WHICH THE GUS JUSTICE SECRETARY SAYS WE'RE STAYING IN MEANTIME THE MAYOR OF LONDON YOU GET THE IDEA HOPE YOU'RE ALL FOLLOWING THIS WHEN THEY LET ME SUMMARISE THE TORY PARTY'S MORE PUBLICLY DIVIDED THAT IT HAS BEEN FOR YEARS SINCE IN FACT THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN GENT JOHN MAJOR FOUGHT TO KEEP HIS PARTY TOGETHER
ALONGSIDE HIM THEM WAS HIS CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHAIRMAN CHRIS LORD PATTEN WHO JOINS ME NOW AND WAS OF COURSE ALSO CHAIRMAN OF THE B.B.C. HAPPY FAMILIES HAPPY FOR HAPPY FAMILIES THERE WERE THOSE CONSERVATIVES WHO BELIEVE THAT THIS REFERENDUM WORDS AND I QUOTE THEIR PHRASE LANCE THE BOIL ISN'T THE TRUTH IT IS MERELY SPREADING POISON
WELL I THINK THAT DEPENDS ON THE OUTCOME I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WILL VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK THAT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF NOT LEAST MY KIDS AND THE NEXT GENERATION I THINK IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF A BETTER FUTURE BUT I THERE WILL BE A LOT OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE IF WE VOTE TO COME OUT I HOPE THAT IF WE VOTE TO STAY IN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING TO WITHDRAW
WELL ACTUALLY NOT TAKE THE ALEX SALMOND PAST PUB PATH AND THINK THIS IS ENOUGH NEVER END UM RATHER THAN A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK I HOPE THAT THEY WILL
SUPPORT THE VERY ELEGANTLY PUT PROPOSITION OF THERESA MAY HER YESTERDAY THAT WE SHOULD OR THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY THAT WE SHOULD BE SELF CONFIDENT AND TAKE A LEADING ROLE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SO I HOPE THAT'S THE POSITION THEY'LL TAKE IN ORDER TO WIN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS TO DO RATHER BETTER THAN SAY YOU'LL BE A FEW QUID WORSE OFF IF YOU DARE TO LEAVE
IT IS OF COURSE DECIDEDLY RELEVANT THAT WILL BE POORER I THINK EVERYBODY ACCEPTS THAT EXCEPT FOR A FEW DIE HARDS ON THE OTHER SIDE IT'S NOT WHAT I DESERVED IN BRUSSELS THERE IS IT IS A COMMISSION NO IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT IT'S BECAUSE I THINK THAT BRITAIN HAS A NATURAL ROLE LEADING EUROPE I BELIEVE
NATELY THAT A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS WE FACE IN THE COUNTRY AND I THINK OTHER COUNTRIES TODAY AND CAN ONLY BE DEALT WITH THROUGH INTERNATIONAL GREATER INTERNATIONAL CO OPERATION AND I WANT TO SEE BRITAIN LEADING THAT WE'RE A GREAT COUNTRY WE'VE GOT A GREAT CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS THE GREATEST IF I MAY SAY SO PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTER IN THE WORLD THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD TO SOME OF THE GREATEST RESEARCHERS WHEN RESEARCHERS SAY HOW MUCH THEY HOPE
DESPERATELY THAT WILL STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT THAT RESONATES WITH ME AND I WANT US TO BE ABLE TO PLAY A LEADING ROLE INTERNATIONALLY I WANTED TO BE PART OF THE GLOBAL LIBERAL ORDER WHICH MAKES THE WORLD MORE STABLE AND MORE DECENT TODAY THAN IT USED TO BE WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF FOR MISSUS THATCHER OVER THE ISSUE OF EUROPE AND THEY SAY LOOK
SHE WAS RIGHT TO WARN ABOUT BRUSSELS CREEPING POWER SHE WAS RIGHT TO SAY THE SINGLE CURRENCY COULDN'T POSSIBLY WORK AND WILL DRAG US ALL INTO AN ECONOMIC CRISIS SHE WAS RIGHT TO HAVE SOME WORRIES THAT ENLARGEMENT WOULDN'T HAVE A PRODUCER SHALLOWER EUROPE BUT DEEP BUT ONE WITH MASS IMMIGRATION
BUT SHE WAS ALSO RIGHT TO ARGUE PASSIONATELY AGAINST REFERENDUMS WHICH SHE REGARDED AS BEING THE FAVOURITE I THINK THESE ARE HER ALMOST HER WORDS THE FAVOURITE DEVICES OF DESPOTS AND DICTATORS AND SHE WAS ALSO RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT THERE WAS A HUGE POLITICAL CASE AS WELL AS AN ECONOMIC CASE FOR EUROPE AND SHE WAS RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING HER LEADERSHIP ROLE IN EUROPE NOT WITHDRAWING WHEN YOU QUOTED THOSE WORDS WHICH I THINK YOU DID TO DAVID CAMERON SAID THE REFERENDUM WAS THE LAST RESORT OF DICTATORS I DID MADGE HE WAS BEST PLEASED WAS HE
I DISAGREED WITH PARTY LEADERS FOR YEARS ABOUT REFERENDUMS I THINK REFERENDUMS UNDERMINE PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY HOW DOES THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF VOID
THE MESS FRANKLY MUCH WORSE THAN A MESS WASN'T IT THE DISASTER OF WHAT BEFELL THE GOVERNMENT THAT YOU WERE A CENTRAL PART OF IN THE MID AND EARLY NINETIES WELL YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WHICH HAS BEEN GNAWING AWAY AT THE UNITY THE INTEGRITY OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY FOOD FOR YEARS I VERY MUCH HOPE
THAT THIS WILL DECIDE THE ISSUE ONCE AND FOR ALL IT WILL REQUIRE YOU SPECTACULAR QUANTITY OF MAGNANIMITY ON THE PART OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND BUT IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE A COMMITMENT BY THOSE WHO LOSE WHICH I HOPE THEY WILL ON THE BRICKS AT SIDE TOO
ALL TOGETHER NOW AND WORK FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY AND FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE FUTURE SO THAT WE DON'T FIND OURSELVES ONCE AGAIN AS DAVID WILLETTS MIGHT PUT IT COMMITTING AN ACT OF INTER GENERATIONAL THEFT AGAINST YOUNGER PEOPLE A LAST WORD ON AN ORGANISATION THAT USED TO BE IN CHARGE OF YOU WERE CHAIRMAN OF THIS ORGANISATION OF COURSE WHICH YOU ARE GENEROUSLY CALLED THE GREATEST BROADCASTER IN THE WORLD THE B.B.C.
THERE ARE PEOPLE ON YOUR SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE E.U. WHO TO PARAPHRASE THEM SAY THE B.B.C. BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO PRODUCE BALANCE IN THIS ARGUMENT AND DOING SO IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT PRODUCE THE FAX WELL
I THINK THE B.B.C. HAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT JOB IT'S HAVING TO COVER THIS REFERENDUM WITH THE SHADOW OF A CHARTER REVIEW AND MY PUTTING DALE HANGING OVER IT I THINK THAT MAY MAKE PEOPLE EXCESSIVELY DEFERENTIAL
WHEN TRYING TO PRODUCE BALANCE YOU HAVE THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND ON WALL OR THE I.M.F. CHIEF SO YOU FEEL OBLIGED TO PUT UP SOME SOME CONSERVATIVE BACKBENCHER THAT NOBODY'S EVER HEARD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT AND IT DOES IT DOES
OCCASIONALLY RAISE EYEBROWS BUT I THINK I WOULD PREFER THE B.B.C. TO BE BEING CRITICISED FOR BEING SO BALANCED EXCESSIVELY BALANCE THEM FOR THAN THEM COULD DOING ANYTHING ELSE IT'S A VERY GREAT BROADCASTER WHICH IS DEDICATED TO TELLING THE TRUTH AND THAT'S AN UNUSUAL THING IN THE WORLD OF THE MEDIA
CHRIS PATTEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S NOW TWENTY TO NINE THE COUNTRY'S CATHEDRAL CHOIRS ALL SIXTY OF THEM WILL BE SENDING THEIR CHORISTERS TO SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL IN LONDON TONIGHT FOR A FUNDRAISING CONCERT THE AIM IS TO RAISE TEN MILLION POUNDS FOR CATHEDRAL CHOIRS BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDER THREAT NOW YOU MIGHT
SENSE HERE THAT THE SOUND IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE I'VE COME OUTSIDE A STUDIO TO A GREEN ROOM WHERE I AM JOINED BY ANDREW CARR WOULD WHO IS SAINT PAUL'S DIRECTOR OF MUSIC AND BY FOURTEEN CHOIRBOYS WHO ARE GOING TO BE TAKING PART IN THE CONCERT TONIGHT GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALL
COUNTRY CAR WOULD UNDER THREAT THAT MIGHT SURPRISE PEOPLE A CATHEDRAL CHOIRS REALLY IN SUCH DIFFICULT SITUATION WHILE THEY ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFICULT TIMES YES I MEAN AS A GREAT JOB GOING ON THE MUSICIANS AND THE PLAYERS YOU'RE SUPPORTING EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON BUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS FINANCIALLY IT'S BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT AND PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WE WANT ANY CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS WONDERFUL TRAINING WHICH IS A TRAINING FOR LIFE BECAUSE IT COSTS

WELL LET'S HEAR
THE CHOIR OF SAINT PAUL SAINT ANDREW CARR WOULD SUPPOSE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
WHAT A GLORIOUS SOUND THAT WAS IT SEEMS A SHAME TO JUST BE SPEAKING AFTER THAT REALLY DOESN'T IT BUT ON WE MUST GO IT'S A QUARTER TO NINE THE TECHNOLOGY GIANT APPLE AS REPORTED ITS FIRST FALL IN SALES IN MORE THAN A DECADE AND ROM YOLK WILL NOW SING THEIR RESULT THANKFULLY IF YOU ARE ONE HOT THESE LEADING THIS MORNING YOUR APPLE HAS SEED IT SAILS FOR THIRTEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST
THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR SALES OF LIFE THEY WERE DOWN AS WELL FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE PRODUCT WAS LAUNCHED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND IT'S THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN CHINA THAT PARTLY BEING BLAMED FOR THAT WILL WITH US IS TIM COOLING FROM THE TECHNOLOGY ANALYSTS CANAL THIS MORNING TIM GOOD MORNING THANKS FOR ME SO WAS THE I'FAITH AND ON THE WAY
OH YES I MEAN THE GUY PHONE CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN BEING CHALLENGED RECENTLY BUT IT'S IT'S A SIMILAR SITUATION ALL OF APPLES COMPETITORS WILL HAVE THEIR SMARTPHONE MARKET IS SLOWING AS THE PACE OF INNOVATION IN ESPECIALLY THAT TOP END OF THE MARKET SLOWS DOWN
HE DID STILL THEY MANAGED TO SELL FIFTY ONE MILLION PHONES GLOBALLY IN JUST THREE MONTHS SAY CATCH A CANDY THIS BE OVERDONE A LITTLE WILL CERTAINLY I MEAN SELLING FIFTY ONE MILLION FOUND IS A PROBLEM THAT MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE PROBLEM THE APPLE HAS IT'S VERY DEPENDENT IN TERMS OF ITS TOTAL REVENUE
ON I PHONED SHIPMENTS SOME SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF ITS REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM MY PHONE SALES AND REALLY IT NEEDS TO CONTINUE THE PACE OF INNOVATION CREATING RADICAL CHANGE IN ITS SMARTPHONE DEVICES IN ORDER TO KICK START THE THAT SORT OF SALES CYCLES THAT WE SAW WHEN IT WOULD INTRODUCE THE I PHONE SIX AND INCREASED THE PHONE SIZE YOU TALK A BIT ABOUT THEIR ABOUT APPLES COMPETITORS BUT BUT IS THIS
FALL IN SALES OF THE I PHONED DOWN TO PEOPLE BUYING PHONES FROM ITS RIVALS OR PERHAPS JUST NOT REPLACING THEIR EXISTING FAINT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IT'S NOT COMPLETELY DO TO DO WITH COMPETITION IT'S MORE A LACK OF PEOPLE UPGRADING DEVICES SO WE SAW IT HAPPEN WITH THE TABLET MARKET WHERE PEOPLE REALLY STOPPED UPGRADING
PRODUCTS BECAUSE THERE WAS REALLY NO NEED AT THE HIGH END OF THE MARKET APPLE REALLY NEED TO KICK START THE SALES CYCLES AND COMBAT THE REDUCED UPGRADE CYCLES THAT IT'S FACING IN A LOT OF THIS MATURE MARKETS BUT ALSO IN THE EMERGING MARKETS AND GROWTH MARKETS AS WELL APPLE UNDER STEVE JOBS WAS KNOWN FOR ITS BIG
GAME CHANGING PRODUCTS CAN IT PULL OFF ANOTHER ONE IS PERHAPS AN APPLE CAR IN THE WORKS WELL HE'S ALWAYS LOOKED AS AN INNOVATIVE COMPANY AND IT REALLY DOES NEED TO KICK ON AND FIND THE NEXT BIG THING IF YOU LOOK AT THE CAR MARKET THE REVVING THE MARGINS THERE COMPARED TO THE SMALL FOR MARKET A VERY VERY VERY DIFFERENT SO APPLE COULD AFFORD TO BUY FORD NOW SO THEY'RE REALLY IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP INVESTORS AND TARGETING THE CAR MARKET
THE PHONE TESSLER IS OBVIOUSLY DOING SOME GREAT WORKING IN AUTONOMY AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND AS THIS MARKET PROGRESSES IT'S LIKELY WILL SEE APPLE ANTO AND TRANSFORM THIS MARKET WHEN WHEN THERE'S A BIT MORE CLARITY AND A BIT MORE FOCUS FROM FROM CURRENT PLAYERS SO YOU DO EXPECT AN EYE CARL AN APPLE CART WHATEVER THEY CALL IT AT SOME POINT AND IT'S CERTAINLY APPLE HAVE INVESTED A LOT IN CAR TECHNOLOGY THEY HAVE OUT THERE
A HIRED MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THAT FIELD WHETHER OR NOT THEY ENTER LOUISE IS OBVIOUSLY A BIG QUESTION THEY LOOK AT ALL THOSE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY MARKETS AND HIGHER INVESTING IN ALL AREAS IN ORDER TO FIND THE NEXT BIG PRODUCTION THAT'S IT CONTINUES DO O.K. THANK YOU TIM TIM COOLING FROM THE ANALYST CANAL
THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE THE NEXT THURSDAY WILL SEE LOTS OF DIFFERENT ELECTIONS TAKING PLACE ACROSS THE U.K. THE BATTLE TO BE MAYOR OF LONDON HAS RECEIVED PLENTY OF ATTENTION BUT THERE'S ANOTHER INTERESTING MAYORAL CONTEST GOING ON WHICH COULD HAVE WIDER POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS IN BRISTOL LABOUR ARE HOPING TO UNSEAT THE INDEPENDENT THERE WHO WAS ELECTED FOUR YEARS AGO AND IT'S BEEN SEEN AS A KEY TEST FOR JEREMY CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP
BEHIND BRUNEL'S TEMPLE MEADS STATION AND NEW ENGINEERING PROJECT IS UNDER WAY
WASTELAND IS BEING CLEARED SO THAT A TWELVE THOUSAND CAPACITY ARENA COULD BE BUILT SO WE'VE ALWAYS HAD TO GO TO LONDON OR CARDIFF BIRMINGHAM TO SEE ANY DECENT BANDS HOPEFULLY WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THEM HERE
WELL OVERDUE I'VE GOT SOME OF THE BATS ARE TENNIS WASN'T THE BEST NEW MUSIC AND IT'S TIME THAT PEOPLE CAME AND
BUILDING A NEW ARENA WAS A KEY PLEDGED BY GEORGE FERGUSON THE FLAMBOYANT RED TROUSER WEARING ARCHITECT IN BUSINESSMAN WHO BECAME BRISTOL'S FIRST DIRECTLY ELECTED MAYOR IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWELVE THE SHOT
THIS TIME GOOD TARGET EVERY I'M TO BLAME FOR EVERYTHING GEORGE FERGUSON WAS ELECTED AS AN INDEPENDENT PORTRAYING HIMSELF AS AN OUTSIDER FREE OF PARTY POLITICS BUT NOW AS HE STANDS FOR RE ELECTION HE HAS A RECORD TO DEFEND HIS CRITICS ACCUSED HIM OF FOCUSING ON BRISTOL'S WEALTHIER MIDDLE CLASSES SOMETHING HE VEHEMENTLY DENIES I'VE REGENERATED TOUGH AREAS AS AN ARCHITECT AND CONTINUED TO
TAKE GREAT INTEREST IN TERMS OF INVESTING IN THE MOST CHALLENGED AREAS IN THE CITY THROUGH MINE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING THAT TO BEAR ON MAKING SURE WE DO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IN THIS QUIRKY AND CREATIVE CITY FERGUSON HAS BEEN A HIGH PROFILE MAYOR CLOSING THE SCENTED TO TRAFFIC ON SOME SUNDAYS SO THAT CULTURAL EVENTS CAN TAKE PLACE FRONTING BRISTOL'S YEAR AS EUROPEAN GREEN CAPITAL
PROFESSOR ROBIN HAMILTON FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND HAS TRACKED THE MAYOR'S PROGRESS AND HE SAYS IT'S BEEN MIXED I THINK THE BETTER OFF THAN WITH THE MIDDLE CLASS PART OF THE CITY ARE REALLY QUITE POSITIVE ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MYRRH FERGUSON BUT WE DO HAVE DATA FROM LOWER INCOME NEIGHBOURHOODS IN THE CITY WHICH SHOW QUITE A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND THAT THEY'RE UNIMPRESSED WITH THE CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THIS LAST THREE YEARS ABOUT LOCAL ELECTIONS ON YOUR MAYORAL CANDIDATE
OUTSIDE A SCHOOL IN SOUTH BRISTOL MARVIN RHYS IS CANVASSING FOR LABOUR WE PUT AS MUCH POLITICAL WILL IN SIR GET THEM HOMES BUILT FOR PEOPLE AS WE HAVE INTO THE ARENA WE HAVE SOME HOMES RHYS WAS BROUGHT UP ON A LOCAL COUNCIL ESTATE AND WAS NARROWLY BEATEN BY FERGUSON LAST TIME LOSING BY SIX THOUSAND VOTES HE'S WORKED IN THE MEDIA AND IN PUBLIC HEALTH BUT HE'S CRITICS SAY HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE TO RUN A CITY
HE SAYS HE'D BE A MORE KILL EEJIT AND MORE INCLUSIVE MET MANY PEOPLE FEEL THAT BRISTOL HAS LEFT THE MAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GREEN CUP AT ALL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE IN BRISTOL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND IT'S NOT DOWN TO ONE PERSON IT'S NOT ABOUT LEADERSHIP
THIS IS ABOUT CAN YOU PULL TOGETHER THE CITY'S INSTITUTIONS THEN BRISTOL RE MORE PROSPEROUS AND A BIT MEAN MORE PROSPEROUS FOR EVERYONE NOT JUST A SELECT FEW
WINNING BRISTOL MATTERS TO LABOUR NATIONALLY AS IT WOULD ALLOW JEREMY CORBIN TO ARGUE THAT HIS KEY MESSAGES ARE GETTING THROUGH AT HUSTINGS EVENTS IT SOMETIMES GOT TESTY BETWEEN MARVIN RHYS AND GEORGE FERGUSON ISN'T LEADERSHIP ABOUT BEING BRAVE ABOUT TAKING DECISIONS RATHER THAN ALWAYS WORRYING ABOUT THE NEXT ELECTION ABSOLUTELY BUT YOU MISTER LEADERSHIP WOULD RULE SHIP GEORGE
ALTHOUGH THE PAIR WERE WAY AHEAD OF THEIR OPPONENTS IN TWENTY TWELVE THIS TIME IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE IT'S ANY OTHER MORE THAN GEORGE POT AIR SHOW
THE LIB DEMS ARE HOPING FOR A BALANCE IN A SOUTH WEST CITY WHERE THEY'VE TRADITIONALLY DONE WELL
WE CONSERVATIVES WHO WERE THIRD LAST TIME BELIEVE THEY CAN CAPITALISED BY FOCUSING ON BRISTOL'S TRANSPORT WOES IF ELECTED I WILL REPEAL THE TWENTY M.P.H. LIMIT ACROSS BRISTOL IT IS ABSOLUTELY AIDING THE CLOGGING UP OF OUR STREETS
THE GREENS AND UKIP HOPE THEY CAN BUILD ON THEIR RECENT SHOWINGS IN THE GENERAL ELECTION
WITH A WIDE RANGE OF OTHER CANDIDATES ALSO STANDING AND WITH VOTERS ABLE TO SELECT A FIRST AND SECOND CHOICE THE RESULT HERE WILL BE INTERESTED IN A CITY THAT LIKES TO BE
JOHN REPORTING THERE TALKING FOR ELECTIONS EARLIER ON SAID THAT NEIL HAMILTON WAS NOT WELSH WELL I OWN APOLOGY TO MISTER HAMILTON IN FACT HE WENT TO UNIVERSITY AND WHILE SHE IS AUTHENTICALLY WELSH APOLOGIES FOR TRADUCED HIM
IT'S SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE NOW AT LAST A CITY IS VINDICATED NOT THE VICTIMS NOT THE RELATIVES WHO FOUGHT FOR THE TRUTH BUT A CITY SO SAYS THE HEADLINE OF THIS MORNING'S LIVERPOOL ECHO THE HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY WAS ALWAYS ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN THE WORST SPORTING TRAGEDY IN HISTORY WAS ABOUT THE WAY LIVERPOOL
WAS SEEN AND THE WAY IT SEES ITSELF TO DISCUSS THAT I'M JOINED ON THE LINE NOW BY MICK OH LORD WHO FOR MANY MANY YEARS WAS EDITOR OF RADIO MERSEYSIDE INCLUDING ON THAT FATEFUL DAY AND ALISTER MCRAE WHO IS EDITOR OF THAT PAPER THE LIVERPOOL ECHO MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU GOOD MORNING MORNING IT'S A PHRASE I THINK ALASTAIR THAT WILL SURPRISE SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT
FROM LIVERPOOL WHY DO YOU SAY A CITY HAS BEEN VINDICATED I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT HILLSBOROUGH IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THAT WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF POST INDUSTRIAL DECLINE LIVERPOOL WAS
DOWN ON ITS LUCK TOXTETH RIOTS ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS IF BAD THINGS HAPPEN THEY TENDED TO HAPPEN IN LIVERPOOL AND THE LIVERPOOL FANS OBVIOUSLY WAS CREATED AS MONSTERS I THINK ARE DOING AND USE THE PHRASE
DRINK FUELLED MARBLE TANKED UP MOB SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THE CITY FELT IT WAS A SLUR ON THE CITY ITSELF THERE WAS SO MANY ATTACKS WERE SO MANY QUARTERS ON LIVERPOOL IN MICHAEL HOWARD THE HOME SECRETARY AT THAT HAD TALKED ABOUT ALLOWING LIVERPOOL TO WITHER ON THE VINE IN A NOTE TO MISSUS THATCHER SO I THINK IT'S NO SURPRISE A LIVERPOOL SORT OF
RETURNED AS ONE TO COMBAT THE ACCUSATIONS IT IT'S THAT SORT OF PLACE TO BE AND MUST MAKE ORDER CONTEXT IS ALL IN OTHER WORDS WHEN YOU WERE I THINK YOU DID A PHONE IN ON THE DAY OF THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER DIDN'T YOU IN A WAY THE PEOPLE OF LIVERPOOL WERE TALKING IN A CONTEXT WHERE NOT JUST THE TOXTETH RIOTS NOT JUST MILITANT OF COURSE RUNNING THE COUNCIL THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS WHICH LIVERPOOL WAS BEING BLAMED
YEAH THE NICK WE HAD THE HIGHS OR STADIUM DISASTER THEN WE HAD HILLSBOROUGH WE HAD THE MILITANT COUNCIL WE HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS AND AND OF COURSE AT THE TIME LIVERPOOL WAS QUITE PROMINENT ON T.V. IN TERMS OF DRAMA WE HAD THE BOYS FROM THE BLACK STUFF WE HAD BRED THE COMEDY WHICH WEEK WHICH GENERALLY WAS NOT LIKED IN LIVERPOOL MURDER THAT WAS HUGELY POPULAR SO A LOT OF THINGS WERE GOING ON AND I THINK IN SOME WAYS A SIEGE MENTALITY WAS STARTED BY MANY
BY MANY OF THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS IN THE CITY AND THAT REALLY ONLY FADED I WOULD SAY IN THE IN THE MID NINETIES ANY TIME LIVERPOOL WAS CRITICISED ON THE T.V. IT WAS VERY VERY EASY FOR A FOR A NATIONAL BROADCASTER WROTE A NEWSPAPER TO FIND SOME WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
WHICH I DON'T THINK WAS THE CASE IN MANY OTHER BRITISH CITIES BUT IT CERTAINLY WAS IN LIVERPOOL SO I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A SIEGE MENTALITY AT AROUND FOR VERY GOOD REASONS ALISTER MCRAE YOU KNOW THE DANGER OF THIS OF COURSE IS THAT PEOPLE ACCUSE THE CITY EVEN NOW PRIVATELY THEY MIGHT DO IT IN SECRET THEY MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE QUOTED BUT THEY MUTTER IT'S A CITY FULL OF PEOPLE OF SELF PITY OF CENTRE MENTALISM YOU NEED TO MOVE ON IF YOU'RE TO BE A CONFIDENT CITY IS THAT TO GET THE CITY ROCK
I THINK THAT THE CITY HAS DEVELOPED AT AN EXTRAORDINARY RATE SINCE AS MICK MENTION THE MID NINETIES THE AWARDING OF CAPITAL OF CULTURE STATUS GAVE THE CITY A HUGE SURGE OF CONFIDENCE AND GAVE OTHER PEOPLE THE CONFIDENCE TO COME AND INVEST IN LIVERPOOL AND WE'VE MOVED FROM THE NINETEENTH MOST POPULAR SHOPPING DESTINATION IN THE U.K. TO THE FOURTH MOST POPULAR IN EIGHT YEARS WE HAVE MAGNIFICENT NEW WATERFRONT MUSEUMS IN ARENAS
AND WE HAVE WONDERFUL NEW SHOPPING CENTRE LIVERPOOL WON THE CITY IS TRANSFORMED SO WHILE OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING LIVERPOOL STOP FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T BEEN FEELING SORRY FOR OURSELVES WE'VE BEEN BUILDING RAPIDLY WE'VE CAUGHT UP ALL OTHER PROVINCIAL CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY AND OVERTAKEN THEM SO I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO COME TO LIVERPOOL BEFORE PUTTING ANY KIND OF JUDGEMENT UPON IF THERE IS A SORT OF SPIRIT DO YOU FEEL I WAS IN THE CITY RECENTLY A SPIRIT OF DEFIANCE OR SPIRIT OF DETERMINATION AS WELL
YES THERE IS AND THAT'S A KIND OF CULMINATION NOT ONLY OF THE BAD TIMES WERE OF THE GOOD TIMES TOO BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE USED TO COME TO LIVERPOOL IN THE SIXTIES WE HAD ALL THE MERSEY BEAT AND THE BEATLES AND THAT'S AN EVEN BEFORE THEN THERE WAS A SPIRIT IN THE CITY THAT WAS FAMOUS OF THE DOCKERS AND THAT THE HUMOUR AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF AND KIND OF PEOPLE FELT THAT THAT'D BEEN KNOCKED OUT OF THEM OR THEY FELT LESS CONFIDENT AT THE TIME THAT ALICE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT CITY
IT CERTAINLY CHANGED AS WELL I THINK THE SPIRIT IT IS DEFIANT AND IT'S PROUDLY DEFIANT BUT NOT IN A DESTRUCTIVE WAY THE WORDS TRUTH AND JUSTICE APPEAR IN MASSIVE LETTERS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE ECHO OF COURSE BUT IT'S A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE CITY HALL THERE ALASDAIR MCRAE YOU HAD IT'S THE ECHO THAT FIGHT FOR JUSTICE NOW THE FIGHT FOR ACCOUNTABILITY
WHY DOES THAT MATTER SO MUCH WHY ISN'T IT NOW ALL RIGHT TO SAY WELL LOOK THE TRUTH IS OUT MOVE ON
THE TRUTH IS OUT BUT TRUTH ALONE IS NOT JUSTICE IS IT TO QUESTION OF DEFINITION SEMANTICS IF YOU LIKE BUT JUSTICE DOES INCLUDE ACCOUNTABILITY NOW IF WE WERE SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT A LOSS OF POLICE CONTROL ON THE DAY FOLLOWED
FOLLOWED BY FOLLOWING A LOSS OF THE ABILITY TO PREPARE PROPERLY AND THEN HER POOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE ON THE DAY THAT'S ONE THING AND IF THE PEOPLE NOW BEING HELD CULPABLE HAD PUT THEIR HANDS UP AT THE TIME AND SAY
WE HAVE PERFORMED APPALLINGLY WE HAVE FOULED UP IN SPECTACULAR FASHION WE ARE SO SORRY WE ARE FULL OF REMORSE THEN O.K.
JUSTICE BUT TO SPEND THE NEXT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AVOIDING THE BLAME IN FACT WORSE THAN THAT SEEKING TO PIN THE BLAME
ON FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS WHO AS INQUIRIES INQUESTS HAVE CONCLUDED WERE ABSOLUTELY BLAMELESS THAT IS SCANDALOUS SO MOVING ON AND JUSTICE IS NOT POSSIBLE UNTIL ACCOUNTABILITY HAS TAKEN PLACE USED TO PRESENT A RADIO BRAINS YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TEN SECONDS BEANS MAKE OLD IT HAS TO BE THAT I'M AFRAID
WELL ALL I WOULD SAY IS THAT I MEAN I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT THERE AND I DO THINGS FOR PEOPLE THAT DO HAVE A SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE OR VI IDEA OF MERSEYSIDE COME HERE IT'LL IT'LL CHANGE PERCEPTIONS FOREVER ADULT I TOOK MY OWN BOYS TO LIVERPOOL FOR A WEEKEND NOT A BREAK MANY PEOPLE THINK OF BUT IT WAS A TREMENDOUS WEEKEND UNDER TREMENDOUS IT'S GREAT TO HEAR
