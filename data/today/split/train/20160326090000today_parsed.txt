THE SCHEME WHICH WILL COST ELEVEN BILLION POUNDS WILL BE PAID FOR INITIALLY BY THE ENERGY INDUSTRY BUT THEN PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF FIRST UTILITY ED CAM SAYS COMPULSORY ELECTRONIC DISPLAY UNITS WHICH WERE SHOW CONSUMERS HOW MUCH THEIR ENERGY IS COSTING EVERY HALF AN HOUR WILL WASTE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS HE ARGUES THAT THE SAME INFORMATION COULD BE PROVIDED FAR MORE CHEAPLY THROUGH A MOBILE PHONE UP
THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT DECIDED AGAINST STAGING A SIMILAR MATH ROLL OUT OF SMART METERS SAYING IT DIDN'T MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE FOR MOST HOUSEHOLDS THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS THE METERS WILL MEAN ACCURATE BILLS AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SAVE ENERGY
AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE ABOUT THE STORY ON MONEY BOX AT NOON TODAY HERE ON RADIO FOUR COMMEMORATIONS WILL BEGIN LATER TODAY TO MARK THE CENTENARY OF ISLANDS EASTER RISING THE FAILED REBELLION TO OVERTHROW BRITISH RULE IS SEEN BY MANY AS PIVOTAL IN THE EVENTUAL CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT IRISH REPUBLIC A WREATH WILL BE LAID AT LUNCHTIME IN DUBLIN'S GARDEN OF REMEMBRANCE TO HONOUR THOSE WHO DIED IN THE SIX DAY BATTLE IRELAND'S PRESIDENT MICHAEL D. HIGGINS SAYS HE HOPES THE EVENTS WON'T BE SEEN AS DIVISIVE
I WOULD HOPE THAT PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND WE'LL APPROACH THIS COMMEMORATION AND FOR EXAMPLE AS WE COMMEMORATE THE SUN AS WELL AS WE COMMEMORATE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO GENEROUS
THE FINAL PRINT EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED AS THE TITLE MOVES ONLINE THE PAPER WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AT ITS HEIGHT IT SOLD MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES A DAY BUT IN RECENT YEARS CIRCULATION HAS DROPPED TO AROUND FORTY THOUSAND
THE ROLLING STONES HAVE PLAYED IN FRONT OF AN ESTIMATED HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN THAT HISTORIC FREE CONCERT IN HAVANA CUBAN FANS WOULD HAVE HAD TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC IN SECRET IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES BECAUSE IT WAS CONSIDERED SUBVERSIVE BUT LAST NIGHT THEY FINALLY GOT TO SEE THEIR HEROES IN THE FLESH
MICK JAGGER SPOKE TO THE CROWD IN FLUENT SPANISH BETWEEN NUMBERS AND TOLD THEM I THINK TIMES HAVE FINALLY CHANGING
ZEB SOAMES REPORTING THERE IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN GOOD MORNING I'M SENDING ON O'CONNELL STREET HERE IN DUBLIN THE HOME OF IRELAND'S MAIN POST OFFICE KNOWN STILL SIMPLY AS THE G.P.O. NO NO NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT IS TODAY BUT
BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE G.P.O. STONE COLUMNS MORE BY BULLETS HINT AT THE STORY WHICH THIS COUNTRY IS PREPARING TO CELEBRATE FOR MANY IRISH PEOPLE IT IS A SIMPLE STORY OF HEROISM AND UPRISING AGAINST THOSE WHO'D OCCUPIED AND OPPRESSED THIS COUNTRY FOR CENTURIES
THE BRITISH OF COURSE A STORY CAPTURED ON SCARVES AND BANNERS AND POSTERS SHOWING THE FACES OF THE SEVEN REVOLUTIONARY LEADERS WHO PAID WITH THEIR LIVES THE WORDS OF THE PROCLAMATION OF IRISH INDEPENDENCE WHICH WAS READ OUT AT THE G.P.O. AND THE YEAR NINETEEN SIXTEEN
FOR OTHERS THOUGH IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT THEY RECALL NOT JUST THE INNOCENCE BRITISH AND IRISH WHO DIED NOT JUST THE THOUSANDS OF THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHO WERE FALLING IN NORMANDY AT THE SAME TIME THEY WORRY TOO THAT THE WRONG LESSONS MIGHT BE DRAWN ABOUT THE VALUE OF VIOLENCE
I'M JOINED HERE ON THE STREET AND WAS SURROUNDED BY ALL THE PARAPHERNALIA OF GRAND CELEBRATIONS TO COME BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE ISLAND CENTENARY PROGRAMME JOHN CON CANNON GOOD MORNING TO YOU IN A WAY IS THERE A HINT IN THE TITLE THE CENTENARY PROGRAMME YOU'RE BEING CAREFUL TO SAY THIS IS NOT SIMPLY A CELEBRATION
IT'S NOT JUST SIMPLY A CELEBRATION BUT IT'S A HUGE YEAR FOR IRELAND BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING ESSENTIALLY IS FIRST OF ALL REMEMBER IN THE PAST A PIVOTAL TYLER HISTORY A POP AT POINT OF AIRTIME WHICH LED ULTIMATELY TO INDEPENDENCE VIOLENT BUT AS WELL AS THAT REFLECTING ON THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS AS WE BUILT A REPUBLIC THE SACRIFICES OF OUR PARENTS' GENERATION WERE ALL WENT ON AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
HE'S REALISING THE FUTURE WHERE WE GOING ONE HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW AND HOW DO YOU AVOID THE DANGER THAT SOME ALBEIT A HANDFUL PERHAPS MAYBE A FEW HUNDRED IN THIS COUNTRY MAY SAY AH IF AN ACT OF VIOLENCE WAS REALLY WHAT FOUND IT THIS COUNTRY THEN THAT IS OUR INSPIRATION FOR THE FUTURE SOME OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEEPLY UNPOPULAR AT THE TIME PERHAPS THEY SAY WE DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK THAT'S WHAT WE MUST DO NOW
THAT WOULD BE VERY UNFORTUNATE BUT HAVING SAID THAT NICK LOTS OF COUNTRIES HAVE REVOLUTIONARY PAST WE CATCH SHOW WE'RE FROM THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT WITH ALL ITS COMPLEXITIES AND WHAT WE DID IN THAT REGARD AS WE WENT ROUND THE COUNTRY AND WE HAD EASY FOR A PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH CITIZENS AND SAID HOW DO YOU WANT TO COMMEMORATE HOW DO YOU WANT TO MARK THIS TIME AND HER PEOPLE ARE VERY CLEAR TO US SAYS
WE DON'T WANT TO BE POLITICAL WE WANT TO REMEMBER A TIME IN HER PAST BUT ALSO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED EACH COUNTY AS WE BUILT A REPUBLIC SO THERE'S THE SENSE ONE HUNDRED YEARS ON UNLIKE AT THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY THAT WILL LOOK AT ALL THE COMPLEXITIES SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT
ALL LIVES WERE OF EQUAL VALUE SO WE'VE GOT A COMMEMORATION OF COURSE THE REVOLUTIONARIES THAT LAST ONE I WAS THE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF THE BRITISH MILITARY POLICE FORCE THE LAST OF THOSE BECAUSE IF WE'RE BEING TRULY HONOURABLE TO THAT TIME WERE ALL LIVES ARE OF EQUAL VALUE
THE LESSONS LEARNT FROM THAT CENTENARY HALF CENTENARY CELEBRATION THAT YOU MENTION THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OR WHAT BECAUSE THERE WERE ANXIETIES THEN WEREN'T THERE THAT IT WAS TOO MUCH HE GAVE TOO MUCH TO THOSE WHO SIMPLY WANTED TO CELEBRATE VIOLENCE AND NOT ENOUGH OF THE COMPLEX STEVE DESCRIBED WHAT IT I WASN'T ALLOWED MYSELF TO WITNESS BUT I DID RE WE'VE BRED A LOT ABOUT HER THEM HISTORIANS WOULD SAY THAT AT THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY IT WAS QUITE SINGULAR IN IT WAS TRIUMPHALIST IT WAS MILITARISTIC
HE TOLD ONE STORY WHEREAS THIS TIME OUT WERE TELLING MUCH MORE COMPLEX STORY ABOUT ALL OF THE NARRATIVES THAT SHAPED NINETEEN SIXTEEN SO YES WE ARE ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS WERE FOCUSING ON IS THE ROLE OF WOMEN AND THEIR HUGE ROLE WOMEN PLAYED THEN AND THROUGH THE YEARS WHICH WASN'T ACKNOWLEDGED AT ALL AT THAT TIME WERE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THE ROLE OF THE BRITISH MILITARY BECAUSE
WERE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE TOOK PART IN THE RISING ABOUT THAT SAME TIME NICK TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IRISH MINIMUM WERE FIGHTING IN THE BRITISH ARMY SO WE'VE GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND LOOK AT THAT AS WELL IN A WORD IN THE END THOUGH THIS IS A GREAT AND ENJOYABLE PARTY WHAT IS IT'S A HUGE HUGE TIME FOR IRELAND OF THE DOG AND YOU CAN SEE AROUND YOU HERE KNICKERS THAT WERE PUTTING BIG SCREENS ARE BIG SEEDS UP WE'RE INVITED THE WHOLE COUNTRY TO BE HERE TO BE PART OF THIS BECAUSE YES WE REMEMBER OUR PAST BUT IF THE COMMEMORATION IRONICALLY IS ALL ABOUT THE PRESENT
JOHN CAN KENNETH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD LUCK WITH IT THANK YOU NICK THAT I'M THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN EGYPT SAYS THE CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY STUDENT JULIA OR JENNY WHO WAS TORTURED AND MURDERED IN CAIRO EARLIER IN THE YEAR HAD BEEN ABDUCTED BY A CRIMINAL GANG NOT A SUM HAS CLAY HAVE CLAIMED BY THE SECURITY FORCES BUT TO JOHN CHANT CRAFTERS ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS NEW MY JENNY THROUGH HIS RESEARCH NETWORK GOOD MORNING TO YOU AND YOU DON'T THINK IT'S CREDIBLE
IT'S NOT A CREDIBLE STORY IT'S INHERENTLY IMPLAUSIBLE AND UNLIKELY THAT A CRIMINAL GANG WOULD HAVE ABDUCTED THIS POOR STUDENT IN DOWNTOWN CAIRO ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JANUARY TWENTY SIXTEEN
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED I MEAN I'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN FIELD WORK IN EGYPT FOR TWENTY YEARS OR MORE I DIRECT RESEARCH THAT HAPPENS IN EGYPT WHEN WE ASSESS RISKS ABOUT WHAT FIELD WORKERS FACE IN THE COUNTRY WE DON'T EVER SPEAK ABOUT THE RISK THAT
RESEARCHER MIGHT BE ABDUCTED BY A CRIMINAL GANG AND SO THE STORY THAT THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE COME UP WITH IS SURPRISINGLY IMPLAUSIBLE AND UNLIKE WHAT THEY SUGGEST IS THAT THIS CRIMINAL GANG ALL OF HIS MEMBERS WERE WERE KILLED NOT ARRESTED WEREN'T THEY THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY THAT THE BAG
THAT CONTAIN MY STUDENT CARD HIS CREDIT CARDS PHONE ET-CETERA SEPARATE THIS WAS FOUND IN THEIR LAIR THIS IS PRECISELY THE SKETCHY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE SORTS OF DETAILS THAT WE ARE HEARING THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR POSTED SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF THIS ON THEIR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT BUT WHY WOULD A CRIMINAL GANG HOLD ON TO COMPLETELY YOU KNOW KNOWN VALUABLE OBJECTS FOR SIX WEEKS AND OR INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE FOR SIX WEEKS THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE ANY SENSE
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE'S HIDING IT OR THAT SOME ELEMENTS DID SOMETHING THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE MURDERED MISTER RIDGE IN IT AND THAT THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT JUST DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT
WELL THE MAIN POINT HERE I'M SOMEONE WHO'S TURNED EXPERT EVIDENCE ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND THESE ISSUES ARE FORCED DISAPPEARANCE AND SUMMARY EXECUTION AND TORTURE THAT QUITE A REGULAR FEATURE OF DETENTION IS AMONG THE EGYPTIAN SECURITY FORCES
AND THE MURDER OF JULIA OR JANAE
UNFORTUNATELY BEARS THE MARKS OF THE NORMAL MODE MODUS OPERA AND DIE OF THE SECURITY FORCES IN EGYPT SO THIS IS THE SORT OF A PLAUSIBLE LINE OF ENQUIRY THAT A CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION OR TO BE ADDRESSED
SO WE ACADEMICS BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION IN THE QUESTION OF HIS DAY AND I'M GOING TO GET IT ARE YOU FROM THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES WILL THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES DON'T WANT A CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION BUT WE ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT IS THERE MORE PRESSURE THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT THAT THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT OTHERS CAN CAN PUT ON EGYPT THAT THEY'RE NOT PUTTING ON THEM AT THE MOMENT YOU THINK WELL THERE CERTAINLY IS THIS IS A MATTER FOR THE U.K. GOVERNMENT JULIA OR JANAE WAS A RESIDENT HERE FOR TEN YEARS IT'S A MATTER FOR CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY IT'S A MATTER FOR EVERYONE WHO CARES ABOUT THE QUALITY OF OUR RESEARCH THEM THERE FOR THE FACT THAT FEEL WORK IS A BASIC
FORM OF RESEARCH PRACTICE THAT U.K. ACADEMICS AND OTHERS USED TO INFORM THE PUBLIC'S HAD USE POLICY MAKERS AND WERE VERY UPSET THAT SOMEBODY ENGAGED IN THIS PRACTICE HAS ENCOUNTERED SUCH RISKS IN A IN A PLACE LIKE EGYPT SO IT IS A MATTER OF CONCERN THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ACADEMICS WHO WHO SIGNED THAT OPEN LETTER FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND WE DO BELIEVE IT'S A MAD AIRFLOW AUTHORITIES TO TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY DOCTOR JOHN CHAKRA FROM THE L.S.E. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE ROLLING STONES HAVE PLAYED IN FRONT OF AN ESTIMATED HALF A MILLION PEOPLE AT A FREE CONCERT IN HAVANA CUBAN FANS WOULD HAVE HAD TO LISTEN TO THE BANDS MUSIC IN SECRET IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND EVEN INTO THE SEVENTIES BECAUSE IT WAS CONSIDERED SUBVERSIVE AND BY A STRANGE TWIST THE PERSON TRYING TO STOP THEM PLAYING YESTERDAY AND I WAS THE POPE IT IN ONE PLAY ON GOOD FRIDAY BUT THE STONES TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE PONTIFF AS WILL GRANT THE PORT
HUMANS HAVE BEEN WAITING OVER FIFTY
I A BIT LIKE THIS ONE WHEN THEY FINALLY GET

YOU HAVE TO SAY
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THIS WEEK WAS A BIG DEAL WITH PLEASURE INTO AM I COMING TO LIZ AT THE END OF IT WITH THE ROLLING STONES IS A ARGUABLY EVEN BIGGER THESE FANS COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD NEXT
I LIKE TO SEE THAT REVEREND STAYS HERE IN HOME ON A HISTORICAL EVENT
BETWEEN SONGS MICK JAGGER ADDRESSED HEAD ON THE POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT HAD KEPT THE BAND AWAY FROM THE ISLAND FOR SO LONG WE KNOW THAT YEARS AGO IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HEAR OUR SONGS HE SAID
NO BUT NOW WE'RE HERE PLAIN FOR YOU IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY I THINK TIMES ARE FINALLY AND CHANGE
THE CROWD WENT WILD AT THAT BUT NOT EVERYONE WELCOMES OFF THE CONCERT POPE FRANCIS HAD APPARENTLY CONTACTED THE STONES MANAGEMENT ASKING THEM TO RECONSIDER HOLDING THE EVENT ON GOOD FRIDAY
BUT THE FANS OUTSIDE THE CONCERT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TIME FOR SUCH MEDDLING FROM THE VATICAN WHEN I GOT CAN I SAY THE CONCERT HAPPENED AND IT WAS ON GOOD FRIDAY AND EVERYONE HAD A GREAT TIME GIVE YOU WERE HAD TO WAIT FOR HER SO LONG TO SEE THE ROLLING STONES WHO CARES WHAT IT'S ALL RIGHT I DON'T KNOW BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD FRIDAY BUT JUST ONE WITH A GREAT CONCERT GOERS
IT WAS AMAZING THEY ARE RIGHT THERE ALMOST REACH UP ENTICE ME JAEGER AROUND FOR THAT LONG HE'S STILL GOING TO PERFORM THAT HUMAN AND PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO TO CONCERTS AND SEE THE LAD MUSIC'S UP THE RICE
TODAY THE MUSIC SHOULD BE A GIFT FOR IT ALL RIGHT AND I NOW THE CUBANS WHO CAN GET THEIR MUSIC
IN THE END IT WAS A SET LIST WHERE WORTH WAITIN FIVE AND A HALF DECADES FOR THEIR ENDED ON A CROWD PLEASER TO MICK JAGGER AND THE ROLLING STONES SAYING I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION AND AS THEY LEFT THE STAGE THE CROWD CONTINUED SINGING THE RIFF IT ECHOING INTO THE HAVANA NIGHT I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION BUT IT CERTAINLY DID TONIGHT IN HER
THEY'RE LUCKY WILL GRANT IN HAVANA WHERE I SUSPECT IT WAS A TURTLE WARM THAT IT IS HERE IN DUBLIN HAS A COLD AND WET DAY IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IF YOU WALK JUST A FEW YARDS DOWN O'CONNELL STREET WHERE I'M STANDING AND JUST YOU CAN JUST AS YOU COULD A HUNDRED YEARS AGO READ THE WORDS OF WHAT'S KNOWN SIMPLY AS THE PROCLAMATION ISSUED BY THOSE WHO CALLED THEMSELVES THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE IRISH REPUBLIC
BACK THEN THE WORDS WERE PASTED ON TO WALLS NOW THEY ADORN COMMEMORATIVE POSTERS AND SCARVES THE PROPAGATION WAS ISSUES
IN THE NAME OF IRISH MEN AND IRISH WOMEN I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO AUDREY FLANNIGAN THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE RISING A CENTURY AGO SHE AND MANY OTHERS BELIEVE THAT THE ROLE OF WOMEN WAS FORGOTTEN BY THE MANY WENT ON TO FOUND THIS COUNTRY HER GRAND MOTHER WAS CALLED DOLLY LAWN
THESE ARE THE PICTURES OF HER GARDEN THIS WOULD BE THE NINETEEN SIXTEEN SURVIVORS MEDAL AT THE BOTTOM STUDENTS FIRST MEDAL THEY WERE AWARDED THIS WAS THEIR WAR OF INDEPENDENCE MEDAL WITH THE BROWN AND ORANGE STRIPE WITH THE CON RACK ACROSS TO SAY THAT THEY WERE ACTIVE IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN DALI AT THAT STAGE WAS PART OF COMMON HORN WHICH WAS THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT OF THE WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WOMEN'S COUNTERPART TO THE VOLUNTEERS WHICH WERE MEN WOMEN PLAYED QUITE A ROLE WHAT SORT OF THINGS THEY DO WERE THEY FIGHTING WITH ITS SUPPORTING SPRAYING SOME WOMEN WERE FIGHTING SOME WOMEN DID TAKE UP ARMS WOMEN LIKE COUNTESS MARK THE ITCHEN KATHLEEN IN THEY WERE USED TO KIND OF FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT AT THAT STAGE THEY WANTED TO TAKE UP ARMS AND WOMEN LIKE DOLLY DOLLY WAS ONLY JUST TURNED SEVENTEEN ON SAINT PATRICK'S DAY HER FAMILY WERE VERY INVOLVED
PATRIOTICALLY IN THE EYE A B. WHICH IS THE IRISH REPUBLICAN BROTHERHOOD SIR DALI HAD GROWN UP BELIEVING IN A FREE IRELAND THAT WAS HER FAMILY ETHOS AND SHE IS VERY EAGER TO BE PART OF THE ACTION AND WAS SHE PART OF THE ACTION THAT EASTER NINETEEN SIXTEEN SHE WAS VERY MUCH SO GOOD FRIDAY SHE HAD BEEN SENT BY HER BROTHER WHO WAS LEE MORE CAROL SHE HAD BEEN SENT TO A DESPATCH UPPED AIMING KAREN'S HOUSE HE WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS SO SHE WENT WITH THAT DESPATCH THAT WAS PROBABLY JUST TO SAY EVERYTHING ON EVERYONE'S DRILLED AND WE'RE ALL READY TO GO
BUT HER HEALTH WAS ALSO AN ARMS DUMP HER FATHER HAD A HARDWARE SHOP RIGHT BEHIND THE HOUSE WERE TWO BRITISH ARMY BARRACKS
SO THE BRITISH SOLDIERS AND IRISH SOLDIERS THAT WERE STATIONED IN BARRACKS WHEN THEY WANTED TO GO AND BUY A FEW DRINKS
OR THEY NEED A FEW BOB FOR CIGARETTES OR TO TAKE A WOMAN AGE THEY USED ACTUALLY BRING IN AMMUNITION ON SMALL ARMS A PAIR OF BOOTS TEN GALLONS OF PETROL WHATEVER THEY COULD TO BARTER FOR FIVE BOB
SO THEY WERE TRADING IN ARMS AND AMMUNITION PRE THE RISING AND BUILDING QUITE A STOCKADE IN THESE ARMS DUMP THE PROCLAMATION IS CELEBRATED BECAUSE WOMEN ARE RIGHT AT THE HEART OF IT BUT THEY DIDN'T CONTINUE TO BE DID THEY NO THEY DIDN'T
AND THAT WAS DUE TO A VERY HEAVY INVOLVEMENT BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
WITH OUR MOST PROMINENT TO PRESIDENT OF THE DAY EM AND DEBONAIR WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE VOLUNTEERS AND HE WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT EXECUTE IT AND WOMEN WERE MARGINALISED IN OUR SOCIETY COMPLETELY AND IT WAS DUE TO RELIGION HUGELY DUE TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
IS IT IMPORTANT TODAY FOR YOU TO SEE THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN THE RISING RECOGNISED
ABSOLUTELY THEY PLAYED AN ABSOLUTELY VITAL PART THEY WERE THE BACKBONE OF THE RISING THEY RAN WITH THE DISPATCHES THEY RAN WITH THE AMMUNITION MY GRANDMOTHER RAN WITH AMMUNITION AND SMALL ARMS IN BILLY CANS WHICH WOULD BE MILK CARTONS
AMONG HER SKIRTS BACK AND FORTH THROUGH THE ENEMY BARRICADES UNDER FIRE AT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE WHAT SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD TODAY WOULD DO THAT BE SO HEROIC
TO YOU KNOW BE WILLING TO GIVE HER HER LIFE TO HELP TO FREE HER COUNTRY

THEY'RE DOING IT IN THERE IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY THERE THESE ARE NOT BUSINESSES THEMSELVES COMING OUT AND SAYING WE WANT TO ME WELL I THINK IT'S IT'S A SLIGHTLY PEDANTIC POINT I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT MATTERS THIS IS A BIG DEBATE WHICH IS GOING ON WITHIN BUSINESSES AS WELL I SUPPOSE THE POINT IS THAT IF COMPANIES REALLY DID BELIEVE THAT IT WAS
BAD FOR THEM TO STAY IN THAT THEY WANTED TO COME OUT AT A COMPANY LEVEL THEN IT WOULD CARRY MORE WEIGHT THAN JUST AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAPPENS TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE CUP WELL THERE'S STILL A DEBATE GOING ON AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE TALKING THIS MORNING ABOUT THE MERITS OF WHETHER OR NOT BRITAIN SHOULD BE IN THE SEVERE INDIVIDUALS HAVE COME OUT AND SAID
WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD LEAVE THE E.U. AND WILL BE BETTER OFF AND THERE'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OF THEM IT MEANS SOMETHING YOU COULD SAY WHAT THOSE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BELIEVE IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT DOESN'T IT WELL DONE BIG EXACTLY BUT TO HAVE A BOARD MEETING AND SAY DO WE SUPPORT BRECK'S IT IS A PRACTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN MY EXPERIENCE
OH THAT'S RIGHT AT THE TOP OF ALL OF THESE COMPANIES THERE'S LIKELY TO BE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING THEN NON VIRGINIE QUITE WERE FOR AND AGAINST YES I VOCIFEROUSLY PERSONALLY SUPPORTED THE RETENTION OF STERLING A DOZEN OR SO YEARS AGO
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE A BOARD MEETING AT SAY SHALL WE VOTE TO RETAIN STERLING THAT'S EH THAT'S WHAT THE REFERENDUMS ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE WITHIN COMPANIES AND WITHOUT IT'S ONLY REALLY THE GOVERNMENT THAT HAS SAID YOU CAN FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME TILL YOU CANNOT SPEAK OUT AGAINST STAYING IN THE UNION UNTIL A CERTAIN TIME SO WHAT DO YOU DO TO YOUR BUSINESS IF WE LEFT WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE
DEMOCRACY EQUALS PROSPERITY AND SLOWLY DEMOCRACY IS BEING REMOVED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND
THE POWER HAS BEEN PUT IN THE HANDS OF UNELECTED PEOPLE IN EUROPE AND THE GREEKS THE SPANISH AND SO ON HAVE SEEN IT MORE THAN WE HAVE WHERE THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN BUDGET OR OVER THEIR OWN INTEREST RATES AS A COUCH OTHER KEY CONTROL
THAT A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY HAS BUT THAT'S A IT GOOD SORRY TO INTERRUPT THERE'S INTEREST IT'S SUCH AN INTERESTING ANSWER BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING IS THAT THAT DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT ACTUALLY TRUMPS EVERYTHING ELSE THEY HAD THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF IT WELL COULD BE BETTER COULD BE COULD BE WORSE BUT IT IS SO IMPORTANT IN YOUR VIEW THAT WE CONTROL HER OWN AFFAIRS THAT THAT IS THE THING THAT THAT'S WRONG
DEMOCRACY HAS GONE HAND IN HAND WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PROSPERITY FOR DECADES AND DECADES AND DECADES WEST GERMANY WAS MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL ECONOMICALLY THAN EAST GERMANY SOUTH CAREER IS MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN NORTH KOREA NORTH AMERICA IS THE BEST EXAMPLE WITH ITS DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION AND LOOK AT SOUTH AMERICA
POOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SO MANY OF THE COUNTRIES THERE THEY HAVEN'T HAD DEMOCRACY AND WHICH IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COUNTRY PEOPLE KNOW THIS INSTINCTIVELY PEOPLE KNOW THIS WHO MAKE CLEVER DEBATING POINTS BUT DEMOCRACY EQUALS PROSPERITY IF THEY TAKE IT AWAY YOU'LL GET GREASE AND YOU GET SPAIN AND YOU'LL GET THE MASSIVE ECONOMIC PUMP YOU NOW HAVING WHEN DEMOCRACIES REMOVED FROM PEOPLE THAT'S THE KEY ISSUE
YOU ISSUE A POLE AS WELL THIS MORNING THE RESULTS OF A POLL BUT YOU HAVEN'T ASKED IN THE POLE WERE THE COMPANY'S ACTUALLY WANT TO LEAVE OR NOT YOU'VE JUST ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK WHETHER THEY THINK THE E.U. MAKES IT HARDER OR EASIER TO EMPLOY PEOPLE WHAT WHAT HAVEN'T YOU ASKED THAT OBVIOUS QUESTION IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE RESULT
I HAVEN'T CARRIED OUT THE POLE MYSELF YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT THE QUESTION IS LET'S LEAVE POLE NO IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T CARRIED OUT THEN FAIR ENOUGH I SUPPOSE BUT IT'S BEEN CARRIED OUT THERE IT DOES INTEREST ME THAT THERE IS A POLE IT'S IT'S THE POLE BUT LEAVE SAYS SUGGESTS THAT THE E.U. STOPS ENTREPRENEURS CREATING JOBS BUT IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO CONTAIN THE QUESTION DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE YOU'RE NOT YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN
PICK HOLES IN QUESTIONS OF COURSE BUT AT THE HEART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT IF BRITAIN IS TO REMAIN PROSPEROUS AND I PERSONALLY THINK IF THE WORLD IS GOING TO SURVIVE IN THE LONG RUN YOU HAVE TO ENTRENCH DEMOCRACY AND IF YOU DON'T AND YOU GET AUTOCRACY IN ITS VARIOUS TYPES OF FORMS IT'S VERY BAD NEWS FOR THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY IT SOUNDS LIKE A DRAMATIC BUT I'M CERTAIN THAT'S TRUE FREE PRESS
FREE DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY NOT TRANSFERRING POWER TO APPARATCHIKS IN BRUSSELS THERE MARTIN CHAIRMAN OF J.D. WETHERSPOON'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT A NEWSAGENT HAS BEEN MURDERED IN HIS SHOP IN GLASGOW IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE ATTACK MIGHT BE LINKED TO A MESSAGE HE HAD POSTED ONLINE WISHING HIS CHRISTIAN FRIENDS A HAPPY EASTER STUDENT GARDEN IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN SCOTLAND WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ONE OF THE POLICE TELLING US STEPHEN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
I SAID CHARLES WAS A FORTY YEAR OLD SHOPKEEPER AND FOR YEARS HE AND HIS FAMILY HAD BEEN RUNNING THEIR NEWSAGENT ENSURE LUNCH WHICH IS AN AREA ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF GLASGOW HE WAS A POPULAR MAN HE WORKED HARD TO BUILD GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS CUSTOMERS AND AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WAS THE MESSAGE THAT HE POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA ON THURSDAY NIGHT WISHING PEOPLE ARE HAPPY EASTER IN WHAT HE CALLED HIS BELOVED CHRISTIAN NATION
THAT SAME EVENING A FEW HOURS LATER POLICE WERE CALLED TO AN INCIDENT IN SHAWLANDS THEY FIND MISTER SHAH LYING SHE LOOSELY INJURED IN THE STREET NOT FAR FROM HIS SHOP HE'D BEEN STABBED AND HE WAS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS LATER PRONOUNCED DEAD NO POLICE SPENT YESTERDAY TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND LAST NIGHT THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE TREATING THE ATTACK AS RELIGIOUSLY PREJUDICED THAT THEY'D ARRESTED A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD MAN AND THE COMPACT CONFOUND WAIT MISTER SHY HE WAS ALSO ON WAS ONE
AND THE REACTION OF LOCAL PEOPLE STEPHEN FROM THE MOMENT THAT PEOPLE STARTED TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED FRIENDS CUSTOMERS STARTED COMING ALONG TO THE SHOP TO LEAVE FLOWERS AND SPEAKING TO THEM YOU'VE GOT A SENSE THAT THIS WAS A POPULAR MAN A PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE WORDS OF ONE HE WAS A PLEASANT LOVELY KIND AND GENTLE JUST SOME OF THE DESCRIPTIONS ONE WOMAN TOLD US THAT MISTER SHAH WAS PRAYING FOR ONE OF HER SICK
RELATIVES AND THERE IS A REAL STRENGTH OF FEELING ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AN OUTLET FOR THAT WAS A VIGIL THAT WAS HELD LAST NIGHT ENSURE ONCE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TURNED OUT INCLUDING SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER AND NICOLA STURGEON THEY TURNED OUT TO ALL THE FLOWERS AND SILENTLY P. TRIBUTE TO A MAN WHOSE DEATH HAS LEFT THAT COMMUNITY SHOCKED STEVEN GARDEN IN GLASGOW THANKS
NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS MOST OF THEM RUN PICTURES OF YESTERDAY'S VIOLENCE IN BRUSSELS THE DAILY MAIL SAYS A SCREAMING WOMAN WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE HAS MAST POLICE CORNERED AND SHOT A SUSPECTED SUICIDE BOMBER THE DAILY MIRROR CALLS IT TERROR AT A TRAM STOP THE GUARDIAN'S MARTIN CHILL OFF
PROVIDES ANALYSIS SAYING THAT THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP STRATEGIC GOAL IS TO EXPORT CHAOS TO EUROPE HE'S RECEIVED AN ACCOUNT OF A MEETING A BUYER'S LEADERS IN SYRIA FROM SOURCES WITHIN THE MILITANT GROUP THE LEADER SAID THEY WERE TURNING THEIR FOCUS TO EUROPE FROM HOLDING ONTO CONQUERED LANDS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND HAD DISPATCHED FOREIGN FIGHTERS
BACK TO THEIR HOMELANDS TO PREPARE ATTACK PLANS THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAS A RETURN TO LIFE AS USUAL IN WESTERN CITIES WILL NOT BE EASY I S. IS AN INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS ADVERSARY BUT IF THE E.U. DEMONSTRATES UNITY THE GROUP CAN BE OVERCOME MUST BE MORE EFFECTIVE SHARING OF INFORMATION ACROSS BORDERS IT SAYS A LETTER WRITER TO THE INDEPENDENT HAS ANOTHER IDEA THE LEADERS OF THE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES NEED AN IMMEDIATE CHARM OFFENSIVE AMONG ALL MUSLIM COMMUNITIES MAKING SURE THEY FEEL TOTALLY INCLUDED HE SAID
THE SUN HAS BEEN CENSURED BY THE INDEPENDENT PRESS STANDARDS ORGANISATION FOR A STORY ABOUT BRITISH MUSLIMS LAST NOVEMBER AND IT PRINTS THE WATCHDOGS RULING IN FULL ON PAGE TWO THE PAPER HAD REPORTED THAT NEARLY ONE IN FIVE BRITISH MUSLIMS HAD SOME SYMPATHY WITH THOSE WHO'D FLED THE U.K. TO FIGHT FOR I.N.S. IN SYRIA IT ILLUSTRATED THE STORY WITH A PICTURE OF MUHAMMAD WAS THE I S. FIGHTER KNOWN SIMPLY AS JIHADI JOHN
THE WATCHDOG SAYS THE SUN FAILED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE CARE IN ITS PRESENTATION OF A SURVEY RESULTING IN WHAT IT CALLED SIGNIFICANTLY MISLEADING COVERAGE DAILY TELEGRAPH FOCUSES ON ADVICE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND THE PEOPLE SHOULD HALVE THE AMOUNT OF DAIRY FOODS TO CUT A BIG SETTEE THE PAPER SAYS JUST ONE LARGE LATTE COFFEE BUT A WOMAN OVER THE NEW RECOMMENDED DAILY LIMIT FOR DAIRY INTAKE IT SAYS THE ADVICE HAS BEEN HEAVILY CRITICISED BY NUTRITIONISTS M.P.S THE DAIRY INDUS
THE GUARDIAN IN ITS LEAD SAYS CONSERVATIVE MINISTERS ARE PLANNING TO REPEAL AN ARRAY OF OFFICIAL GUIDANCE ON ANIMAL WELFARE STANDARDS WITH THE CODE ON CHICKEN FARMING TO BE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THE POULTRY INTEREST INDUSTRY NEXT MONTH
THE GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY QUIETLY TABLED A DRAFT ORDER TO SCRAP THE STATUTORY CODE IT SAYS A SPOKESMAN FOR DEAF OR THE DEPARTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENT FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS SAYS NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO THE LEGISLATION BUT AN ANIMAL WELFARE CHARITY TELLS THE PAPER IT'S VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT AN INDUSTRY CODE WILL BE AS TOUGH AS A GOVERNMENT CODE THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
THIS WEEK IN HIS REGULAR MEET THE AUTHOR INTERVIEW JIM MEETS A NEW WRITER N.G. LEONARD HE'S WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A BOY AND THE BEATLES
WHEN A BOY'S FATHER DISAPPEARS HE HAS TO TRY TO FIND HIM DARCUS HE'S THE YOUNGSTER WHO SETS OUT TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY AND TO BRING HIM BACK
WITH THE HELP OF UNEXPECTED INSECT HELPERS LED BY A BEETLE THE SIZE OF A HAMSTER WHICH HAD TO BE JUST ABOUT THE BEST FRIEND HE'S EVER HAD IN BEATLE BOI N.G. LEONARD'S FIRST BOOK
DARCUS DISCOVERS A WORLD OF ADVENTURE THAT'S MORE EXCITING AND DANGEROUS THAN ANYTHING HE HAS EVER IMAGINED AND HE'S DRAWN INTO THE OLDEST STORY OF THEM ALL
OF GOOD AGAINST EVIL WELCOME IT IS A STORY IN THE CLASSIC MOULD HER DISAPPEARANCE A MYSTERY
AN UNEXPECTED FRIEND IN TIME OF NEED IN THIS CASE A BEETLE BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT ATTRACTS US AND STILL GRIPS US IN STORIES OF THIS KIND SO ELEMENTAL STORE
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING IN ALL OF US REALLY WANT TO IDENTIFY WITH STRONG CHARACTERS THAT ARE GUIDED BY POSITIVE AND MORAL PRINCIPLES IT'S THAT QUESTION OF DOING THE RIGHT THING
BEING BRAVE BEING VALIANT STRUGGLING WITH YOUR FEARS THAT I THINK SO FASCINATING AND WE DO IT AS ADULTS BUT WE OFTEN DISGUISE THE FACT WE DO IT SO I THINK STORIES LIKE THIS THAT HAVE A CHILD WHO'S CONFRONTING THOSE KIND OF
DECISIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY THAT A UNIVERSAL SO LIKE OLD STORIES THAT IS A MORAL HERE WHICH IS YOU KNOW HE WANTS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS DAD IT'S A DARK MYSTERY HE CONFRONT
BUT HE ALSO DISCOVERS THAT THE BEETLE THE SIZE OF A HAMSTER AS HER SCENT COMES ALONG AND HELPS THEM WITH AN ARMY OF OTHER BEATLES TURNS OUT TO BE A BETTER FRIEND THAN ALMOST
ANYBODY HE SEVERED KNOWN ONE HE'S GOT A COUPLE OF FRIENDS WERE HELPING THEM HUMAN ONES THE BEETLE IS BETTER THAN MOST OF MOST OF US ISN'T IT YEAH AND I THINK QUITE
QUITE OFTEN OUR CLOSEST COMPANIONS CAN BE AN ANIMAL IS RARE THAT THEY'RE AN INSECT BUT I BECAME VERY FASCINATED WITH JAPANESE CULTURE WHERE LIKE WE WOULD HAVE A PET HAMSTER OR A PET GUINEA PIG WHEN WE WERE A CHILD IN JAPAN THEY DO ACTUALLY HAVE PET BEETLES WHICH WAS A NOVEL THING TO DISCOVER AND IT'S VERY
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY ALIEN ABOUT INSECTS BECAUSE THEIR SKELETONS ARE ON THE OUTSIDE THEY HAVE AN EXOSKELETON WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T READ THEIR BREATH I THINK IT'S HARDER TO EMPATHISE WITH A CREATURE THAT HAS AN EXOSKELETON SO I THOUGHT IT WAS A REAL CHALLENGE TO TRY AND TRY AND REPLICATE THE KIND OF PASSION AND LOVE YOU CAN HAVE FOR A MAMMAL
YOU OBVIOUSLY MADE A DECISION THAT THE BEETLE SHOULDN'T SPEAK WHY WELL I DID EXPERIMENT WITH SPEECH AT THE BEGINNING BUT IT DID SEEM WELL IT SEEMED RATHER CUTE AND THIS IS NOT A QUEUE IT'S DIDN'T WORRY DIDN'T TURN BREAKING YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T WORK AND I WORK AT THE NATIONAL THEATRE AND WE'VE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTION OF MICHAEL MOORE CARGOES WAR COURSE AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL AND MOVING PRODUCTIONS I THINK I'VE EVER SEEN AND AT THE HEART OF THAT SHOW IS A HORSE AND A BOY WHO HAVE THIS RELATIONSHIP AND THERE IS NO SPEECH THEY NEVER CAN COMMUNICATE THEY COMMUNICATE THROUGH GESTURE AND THAT GAVE ME THE IDEA
I WONDER HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WAY THAT I THINK BOOKSHOPS PARTICULARLY NOW TRY TO
FIT BOOKS TO AGE GROUPS AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A SHELF FOR EIGHT YEAR OLD AND A SHELF FOR A TEN YEAR OLD I THINK A LOT OF AUTHORS AND FIND OUT A BIT SILLY WHAT DO YOU THINK YEAH IT'S SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T OCCUR TO YOU WHEN YOU START WRITING A BOOK THAT AGE
THEN THERE IS A LIMITED EVERYONE YES IT'S ABSOLUTELY FOR EVERYONE I MEAN I WROTE IT IT'S WRITTEN IN MY NARRATIVE VOICE I'M A GROWN UP I KNOW THE CHILDREN ARE PROTECT THE PROTAGONISTS ARE CHILDREN BUT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME UNTIL I VENTURED INTO THE WORLD OF PUBLISHING THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE RECOMMENDED TO A SPECIFIC AGE GROUP AND WHEN IT WAS IT WAS I THINK EIGHT TO FOURTEEN IS WHAT THEY RECOMMEND
I WAS QUITE SURPRISED COS TO ME SOME OF IT'S VERY DARK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO READ THIS BOOK WITH AND THIS IS A COMPLIMENT WITHOUT THINKING THAT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY
ROALD DAHL I MEAN THE KIND OF THE GRUESOME THE GROTESQUE BUT I THINK THE THE EVIL CHARACTER IN A SENSE COULD HAVE STEPPED OUT OF THE WITCH COULDN'T YOU YES AND QUITE A LOT OF THE OTHER SECONDARY VILLAINS COULD HAVE EASILY COME OUT OF A DULL I MEAN I READ DOL A LOT WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND I WAS ALWAYS STRUCK BY
ACTUALLY HOW BRUTAL HE CAN BE ABOUT HOW NASTY ADULTS ARE CAPABLE OF BEING HE WAS I THINK HONEST YOU HAVE A TEN YEAR OLD I THINK AND THE YOUNGER CHILD AS WELL THE DID YOU ROAD TEST
WELL ACTUALLY I HAVE A TEN YEAR OLD THAT DOESN'T LOVE TO READ HE ACTUALLY READ THIS BOOK TWO WEEKS AGO AND I HAD TO BRIBE HIM WITH TIME ON THE COMPUTER SO I WAS THIS REACTION ACTUALLY HE WAS SURPRISED AND SAID KIND OF AT THE END COS HE WAS HE WAS GRIPPED BY THE STORY OF COURSE AND AT THE END HE WAS LIKE A LOT ACTUALLY THAT'S QUITE GOOD I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED THAT HE GOT
AND YOU TALKING TO JIM THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER HIM ASKING AT THIS MORNING IS CATHERINE PAID MISTER EDITOR OF THE TABLET GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING JUST
FOR PLENTY OF PEOPLE TODAY IS KNOWN AS EASTER SATURDAY PART OF THEIR FOUR DAY WEEKEND THAT STARTS ON GOOD FRIDAY AND FINISHES ON MONDAY IT'S FREQUENTLY CALLED THE EASTER WEEKEND BY THE TOURIST INDUSTRY
BUT IT'S NOT EASTER SATURDAY AT ALL IT'S A MISNOMER AND FOR CHRISTIANS LIKE ME IT'S ONE OF THE ODDEST DAYS OF THE YEAR EASTER DOESN'T BEGIN UNTIL SATURDAY SLIPS INTO SUNDAY
YESTERDAY GOOD FRIDAY COMMEMORATED THE CRUCIFIXION OF JESUS CHRISTIANS TODAY REMEMBER THE DAY AFTER JESUS EXECUTION WHEN HIS DISCIPLES WOULD HAVE BEEN GRIEF STRICKEN AND ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF JESUS WAS A CORPSE IN A TOMB
TODAY CHURCHES OR EMPTY NO FLOWERS STATUES AND IMAGES SHROUDED LIKE CHRIS' BODY THE ALTAR STRIPPED BARE NO CANDLES NOTHING
AND CATHOLIC CHURCHES THERE IS NO MASS TODAY AT ALL THE TABERNACLE WERE CONSECRATED HOSTS ARE KEPT FOR DISTRIBUTION AS COMMUNION HAS ITS STORES FLUNG OPEN AND IS LEFT EMPTY AS IF THERE IS NO HOPE
BUT OF COURSE THERE IS HOPE FOR CHRISTIANS BECAUSE UNLIKE THE DISCIPLES THEY KNOW THAT EASTER THE DAY MARKING THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER
BECAUSE OF THE STRANGENESS OF TODAY ALL TOO OFTEN IT'S TEMPTING TO WANT TO RUSH ON TO EASTER AND HAS TODAY WHERE'S ON IT DOES BECOME PREGNANT WITH EXPECTATION CHOIRS AND REGIONS REHEARSE FOR THE EASTER SERVICE FLOWER ARRANGERS ARRIVE WITH THEIR BLOOMS
LATER ON SATURDAY COMES THE EASTER VIGIL WERE CANDLES ARE LIT AND BELLS WRONG AGAIN AND ADULTS ARE BAPTISED
TODAY THOUGH IS ALSO A MOMENT TO PAUSE TO CONTEMPLATE OUR GRIEFS RATHER THAN PUSH THEM TO ONE SIDE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE RECENTLY BEREAVED WHO LIKE THE DISCIPLES MAY FEEL ALL HOPE IS LOST
IT'S A TIME FOR THINKING ABOUT EMPTINESS BECAUSE THIS SATURDAY CORRECTLY CALLED HOLY SATURDAY AND SOMETIMES EMPTY SATURDAY IS A REMINDER OF WHAT SAINT CALL DESCRIBED AS CHRIST EMPTYING HIMSELF TO ASSUME THE CONDITION OF THE LOWEST OF HUMANITY
BEING TREATED LIKE A COMMON CRIMINAL INTIMATES POWERLESSNESS ISN'T JESUS CASE IT WAS ALSO FULL OF PROMISE
A DAY LIKE TODAY A TIME OF WAITING IS A MOMENT TO SAVOUR SOMETHING SO RARE AND CONTEMPORARY LIFE WHICH IS SO OFTEN ABOUT FOCUSING ON WHAT IS COMING UP NEXT
T.S. ELIOT IN HIS POEM LITTLE GETTING RIGHTS OF THE NEED TO WAIT AND FOR HOPE AND LOVE AND FAITH TO ALL BE IN THAT WAITING LIKE THE HONEST HE SAYS HE STILL
SO TODAY I'LL TRY AND FORGET TOMORROW'S CHOCOLATE AND OTHER PLEASURES AND TRY AND RELISH THIS ODD THAT VERY SPECIAL DAY
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH CATHERINE PEP AND THE EDITOR OF THE TABLET TIME NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT SECURITY IS HIGH HERE IN DUBLIN ARE NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS WEEK OF ALL WEEKS ANY BIG GATHERING ANYWHERE IN EUROPE WILL BE SEEN AS A POSSIBLE TARGET FOR TERRORISTS
IT IS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN WARNINGS FROM THE SECURITY FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT REPUBLICAN TERRORIST THOSE CALLING THEMSELVES CONTINUITY I.R.A. WHAT THE NEW I.R.A. MAY USE THESE CELEBRATIONS OF THE RISING AS AN EXCUSE FOR MORE VIOLENCE OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF ATTACKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER
THE SOUND OF THE MAYHEM WHICH FOLLOWED FOUR GUNMEN OPENING FIRE IN THE REGENCY HOTEL IN DUBLIN NOW WE HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM THE POLICE THAT TWO OF HER REPORTERS ARE UNDER TRIP FROM FROM THE GANGS FOR FOR WRITING ABOUT THE GANG'S ACTIVITIES THESE ARE TWO VERY SERIOUS GANGS AND THERE ARE REPORTING OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES HAS LED TO THE THREAT TO THE CHANCE INVOLVES A PRISON OFFICER WHO WAS INJURED IN A DISSIDENT REPUBLICAN BOMB ATTACK IN BELFAST EARLIER THIS MONTH HAS DIED
ADRIAN IS MAY WHO WAS FIFTY TWO WAS PREVIOUSLY SAID TO BE MAKING A GOOD RECOVERY IT'S UNDERSTOOD HE HAD A HEART ATTACK
THOSE THE STORIES OF RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE LISTENING TO THEM PROFESSOR MONICA MCWILLIAMS A JOINT IS ON THE LINE FROM BELFAST SHE'S AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER AND IS A MEMBER OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT APPOINTED PANEL TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO DISBAND THE PARAMILITARIES GOOD MORNING TO YOU PROFESSOR WILLIAMS ARE YOU ANXIOUS THIS EASTER WEEKEND BUT SOME MAY USE THIS AS AN EXCUSE FOR MORE VIOLENCE
WELL IT'S ALWAYS VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT MAY HAPPEN THEN THIS WEEKEND OF ALL WEEKENDS BUT IN TERMS OF MANY OF THE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN TALKING TEA HERE IN BELFAST AND THE ESTIMATION IS THAT IT WILL BE QUIET AND THEY SINCERELY HOPE THAT'S THE CASE BUT AS YOU'RE PROBABLY WELL AWARE OF THAT
SPONTANEOUS VIOLENCE CAN BREAK OUT VERY QUICKLY AND BE ORCHESTRATED BY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S THE LACK OF PREDICTABILITY THAT MIX THAT VERY DANGEROUS BUT MOST PEOPLE HERE AND THEIR GETS AN DUBHLAN A FAIRLY RELAXED THESE GROUPS ARE VERY HEAVILY IN THROUGH HER TREATMENT BY THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
AND WE NOW KNOW THAT TO BE THE CASE THAT'S WHY IT WAS SUCH A SHOCK THAT THEY SUCCEED AT AND PLANTING THE BOMB ON TO MISTER IF SHE MADE THE PRISONER AFTER SHISH CAR RECENTLY
MOST OF THE PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN FOILED AND THAT WAS A SETBACK IT'S MORE OF A SET IN TERMS OF THE RECRUITMENT OF YOUNG PRISON OFFICERS INTO THE NEW PRISON SERVICE RATHER THAN A SETBACK FOR THE PEACE PROCESS PER SE
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THESE GROUPS ARE WE TALKING OF THOUSANDS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS TENS ILL WE'RE TALKING BUT SMALL NUMBERS IF THEY ARE EVEN REACHING TWO HUNDRED
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY'RE SPLINTER OUT NO NOT UNITE AT
THEY FOLLOW IT AMONGST EACH OTHER THEY HAVE FEUDS AND WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE
MORE ON THE EDGE OF CRIMINALITY AND GANGSTERISM IN TERMS OF HAVING AN IDEOLOGY IN RELATION TO THAT ISLAND
THAT'S MINIMAL THESE DAYS MOST OF CONCENTRATION TENDS TO BE I'M GETTING RESOURCES THREE DOG DRUG DEALING AND HENCE THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT IN DUBLIN
SO IF ANYBODY CLAIMS TO BE INSPIRED BY THE ACTS THAT ARE BIG COMMEMORATED THIS WEEKEND THE UPRISING IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN YOU THINK IT IS SIMPLY THAT IT IS AN EXCUSE FOR CRIMINALITY THAT THERE ARE FEW WHO GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT WHAT WORKED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO CAN WORK IN THE FUTURE YES THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT VERY VERY SMALL NUMBERS
STILL BELIEVE THAT THE WAY TO RESOLVE POLITICAL DIFFERENCES IN RELATION TO THE ASPIRATION OF SELF DETERMINATION FOR A UNITED IRELAND IS THROUGH VIOLENCE
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HERE IN NORTHERN IRELAND ARE COMMITTED TO THE PEACE PROCESS OUR PARTNERS TO THE PEACE PROCESS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE ALL PARAMILITARIES ARE ALL ON CEASEFIRE THEY WERE VERY VERY SMALL AS I SAID VERY SMALL NUMBERS AND THEIR IDEOLOGY HAS TO BE QUESTIONED AND HIS QUESTIONED THEY DON'T HAVE COMMUNITY SUPPORT IN THE WAY THAT DURING THE THIRTY YEARS OF THE CONFLICT THE VARIOUS PARAMILITARIES DEAD
O.K. THE CONCERN FINALLY THOUGH THAT SOME IT'S NOT THAT MANY BUT SOME HERE IN IRELAND HAVE GOT THAT THERE'S A SORT OF AMBIGUITY IF YOU LIKE IN THE STATES ATTITUDE IN THE COUNTRY'S ATTITUDES IN VIOLENCE PRECISELY BECAUSE IT CELEBRATING WHAT WAS A VIOLENT INSURRECTION
WELL IT WAS ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF COLOURFUL AND IT WOULD BE SURPRISING IF IT WASN'T COMMEMORATE IT IN SOME WAY
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT'S NORTH AND SOUTH HAVE ATTEMPTED TO KEEP THIS A PEACEFUL COMMEMORATION
IT WAS A VIOLENT PERIOD VIOLENCE INDEED WAS USED AND IT WAS SEEN AS A REVOLUTION THEY MELANIE AND FOR THAT IT IS BEING COMMEMORATED BUT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT TO SUGGEST AN ALLEYWAY THAT THAT SHOULD BE REPLICATE AT ONE HUNDRED YEARS LATER
PROFESSOR MCWILLIAMS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
THE TIME THREE MINUTES THEY'D JAY WYNNE IS AT THE WEATHER CENTRE THIS MORNING WITH A TAIL OF RAIN FOR US ALL I THINK IS THAT RIGHT YES IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT NEXT FEW DAYS ACTUALLY COMPARED WITH YESTERDAY WINDY DAY FOR ALL PARTS OF THE U.K. TODAY STRONGER SWINDERBY IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE U.K. AUGUSTA THE COAST COULD REACH SIXTY MILES AN HOUR SO TO BE AWARE OF THAT
WE'VE GOT SOME RAIN MOVING IN FROM THE WEST THAT'S BEEN QUITE WET SO FAR TODAY ACROSS SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND THE RAIN BE ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT THE DAY HERE AND IT WILL BE QUITE BLUSTERY EIGHT NINE TEN DEGREES WILL BE A TOP TEMPERATURE SOME OF THAT RAIN IS JUST BEGINNING TO PUSH ITS WAY ACROSS THE IRISH SEA SO A LOT OF CLOUD AND WINDY TOO FOR THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND WALES THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND IT WILL TURN INCREASINGLY WET DID YOU GET ON INTO THE AFTERNOON IN PARTICULAR AND THE WINDS ARE THE VERY BLUSTERY INDEED PARTICULARLY AROUND THE COAST OF WALES AND THE SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND ELEVEN TWELVE OR THIRTEEN DEGREES YOUR TOP TEMPERATURE
HOWEVER NOT WET EVERYWHERE BECAUSE MUCH OF THE MIDLANDS AND THE EAST SIDE OF ENGLAND'S DOING REASONABLY WELL IN THE MORNING A BIT OF BRIGHTER WEATHER FOR SOME JEN IT'S CLOUDING OVER A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN FOR THE AFTERNOON BUT MOST PLACES DRY THE RAIN IT WILL SET IN LATE AFTERNOON EARLY EVENING BEFORE THAT WAS HE THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN DEGREES IN THE LONDON AREA
SO A SPELL OF WET AND WINDY WEATHER MOVING EASTWARDS THROUGH THE DAY TODAY CLEARED OUT OF THE NORTH SEA OVERNIGHT AND THEN THE FEAST TODAY IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER BLUSTERY DAY WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE BUT ALSO SOME SHOWERS WHEN THE SHOWERS COME ALONG THROUGH TOMORROW THEY COULD BE HEAVY WITH SOME HAIL AND SOME THUNDER MIXED IN BUT THEY SHOULD BE AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE IN BETWEEN THE SHOWERS BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING A FRESHER FEEL TO THINGS AND THEN ON EASTER MONDAY STORM KATY WILL BE BRINGING SOME VERY WET AND VERY WINDY WEATHER TO THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE U.K.

OF DEALING WITH ALCOHOL RELATED PROBLEMS
THE O.J. ALSO WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO EXTEND THE TAX BREAKS ON SOME BEERS TO LOWER STRENGTH CIDERS WINE AND SPIRITS SO THEY CAN BE SOLD AT A CHEAPER PRICE AND THE HIGHER STRENGTH EQUIVALENTS THE PORTMAN GROUP WHICH WORKS WITH THE DRINKS INDUSTRY SAYS IT IS CREATING AND PROMOTING LOWER STRENGTH PRODUCTS AND IS COMMITTED TO REDUCING HARMFUL DRINKING
THE FINAL PRINT EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED AS THE TITLE MOVES ONLINE THE PAPER WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AT ITS HEIGHT IT SOLD MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES A DAY BUT IN RECENT YEARS CIRCULATION HAS DROPPED TO AROUND FORTY THOUSAND
THE ROLLING STONES HAVE PLAYED A HUGE FREE OPEN AIR CONCERT IN CUBA THE FIRST OF ITS KIND ON THE COMMUNIST ONE ISLAND DURING THE COLD WAR WESTERN ROCK MUSIC WAS DISCOURAGED IN CUBA WITH THE ROLLING STONES BANNED FROM STATE RUN RADIO STATIONS AN ESTIMATED HALF A MILLION PEOPLE TURNED OUT FOR THE EVENT ALTHOUGH NO OFFICIAL CROWD FIGURES WERE RELEASED BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT FROM HAVANA WILL GRANT REPORTS
CUBANS HAVE WAITED MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS TO SEE A BIG ROCK'N'ROLL BAND PLAY IN HAVANA WHEN IT CAME IT WAS THE BIGGEST OF THEM ALL
FROM THE VERY START THE ROLLING STONES' DELIGHTED THE ENORMOUS CROWD CHOOSING ONLY THE MOST POPULAR HITS FROM THEIR BACK CATALOGUE JUMPING JACK FLASH PAINT IT BLACK GIMME SHELTER AND BROWN SUGAR
BETWEEN SONGS MICK JAGGER SPOKEN SPANISH TO THE CROWD WE'RE SURE THIS IS GOING TO BE AN UNFORGETTABLE NIGHT HE YELLED AT THE START HE WASN'T WRONG MANY IN THE CROWD WEREN'T BORN WHEN JAGGER AND RICHARDS' FIRST WROTE A SONG TOGETHER AND THE CUBAN REVOLUTION WAS IN ITS INFANCY TO BUT OTHERS THERE REMEMBER THE TIMES WHEN THEIR MUSIC AND WESTERN ROCK MUSIC IN GENERAL WAS BANNED FROM THE AIRWAVES UNDER FIDEL CASTRO
MICK JAGGER EVEN MADE A NOD TO THEIR LABELS HAS AN ANTI REVOLUTIONARY INFLUENCE ON CUBA'S YOUTH WE KNOW THAT YEARS AGO IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HEAR OUR SONGS HE SAID AGAIN ADDRESSING THEM IN PRETTY FLUENT SPANISH BUT HERE WE ARE PLAYING FOR YOU AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY I THINK TIMES ARE FINALLY CHANGING HE ADDED TO A HUGE CHEER
COMING AT THE END OF A WEEK THAT ALSO SAW A VISIT BY PRESIDENT OBAMA TO CUBA IS CERTAINLY FELT THAT WAY BUT THIS WASN'T A NIGHT FOR POLITICS RATHER FOR MUSIC AND DANCING FOR THEIR OWN CORE THE STONES PLAYED SATISFACTION AND THE BAND WALKED OFF STAGE WITH THE CROWD STILL SINGING THE REF INTO THE WARM TROPICAL NIGHT CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION WHEN THEY CERTAINLY DID
WE'LL GRANT REPORTING FROM ABOUT THE TIME TEN PAST EIGHT THE RHETORIC FROM EUROPEAN POLITICIANS IS OF A WAR AGAINST TERRORISM BEING SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTED THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS LON TO SAID THE NETWORK BEHIND THE BRUSSELS AND PARIS ATTACKS IS BEING WIPED OUT
THE REALITY OF COURSE IS MORE COMPLICATED THE FRENCH AND BELGIAN AUTHORITIES BOTH STAND ACCUSED OF INCOMPETENCE AND THE REAL IMPACT OF THE KILLER'S HE'S ON INNOCENT CIVILIANS LET'S HEAR FIRST ABOUT THEM MORE THAN SIXTY PEOPLE WOUNDED IN THE BRUSSELS THAT TERRORIST ATTACKS AND ARE STILL IN A CRITICAL CONDITION THAT ACCORDING TO THE BELGIAN HEALTH MINISTER DOCTOR CHRISTIAN MELLOW IS HEAD OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT OSPITAL ERASMUS AND DOCTOR STEFAN NESTS IS HEAD OF THE TRAUMA UNIT AT LEVEN HOSPITAL
IT WAS A DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE TO DEAL WITH PATIENTS AND INJURIES DAREK YOU NEVILLE WANT TO DEAL WITH YOUR TRAIN THING YOU ARE PREPARED TO PLAN BUT YOU'RE NEVER READY FOR TAKING CARE OF THAT AMOUNT OF PATIENCE WITH THOSE INJURIES WE REMAIN WRISTS FIND SPRECHEN STING IN INTENSIVE CARE
WHERE THERE'S A WAR HOSPITAL ALL HER STUDENT TO PATIENT ROOM VERY CLEVER STARTERS WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND IT CREATED ENORMOUS SWATHES OF SOLIDARITY EVERYBODY DOCTORS NURSES CLEAN NEW STAFF EVERYBODY FIND CURIOUS TO HAVE UPPED HIS PEOPLE
TWO OF THE DOCTORS TREATING THE INJURED THAT OF COURSE IS THE COST OR PART OF IT TO THE HUNT NOW FOR THE KILLERS WHO ARE STILL ALIVE AND FOR THOSE WHO HELPED THEM WHICH IS A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED BUSINESS PROFESSOR AZIM ALGAE FRAU WE IS A POLITICAL SCIENTIST AND ADVISOR TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT ON THE PREVENTION OF JIHAD ISM AND IS SOMEONE WHO WAS IN BRUSSELS UNTIL RECENTLY JOINS US NOW FROM CARA GOOD MORNING TO YOU
WHEN FRANCOIS ALONG AND USES THAT PHRASE WIPED OUT TO REFER TO THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR PARIS AND BRUSSELS IS EASY IN ANY SENSE RIGHT DO YOU THINK
SOME C. IS RIGHT BUT WHAT ELSE COULD HE HAVE SET BUT HE WAS ALSO LIKE TEMPERING HAS A SAYING THERE MIGHT BE OTHER CELLS OUT BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING
AFTER NOVEMBER TEX AND PARIS THEY HAVE BEEN YOU HUGE SECURITY FAILURES A LITTLE LESS OF THE FRENCH SIDE TO HER MUM'S FOR IGNORANCE ABOUT IN NOVEMBER ATTACKS AND PARIS AND WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED FROM BRUSSELS BUT
THE MAJOR AS WELL AS A BOTTOM SIDE WHICH ARE JUST INCREDIBLE I MEAN MOWLAM BAKE AND THE AS A DISTRICT SCAR BECK WHERE YES IT'S RATES HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR FOUR DECADES AS AS JIHADI HOPPER
THE OLD SERIES OF FAILURES AS THIS IT'S JUST UNIMAGINABLE WHEN YOU SAY NO YOU SAY UNIMAGINABLE WHAT WHAT HAS GONE WRONG WHAT'S THE CAUSE OF IT DO YOU THINK
THE CASTLE IT'S A VERY DEEP BROADCAST WHICH WAS VERY MUCH RELATED TO BELGIUM POLITICS IN A SENSE LIKE BELGIUM LEAD NEVER DID ANY PREVENTION POLITICS WAS A VERY LAX ON IT IT'S THE INTEGRATION OF THE MUSLIM POPULATION BUT I WOULD LIKE TO COME BACK TO SOMETHING TO GIVE HER A WHOLE TERM JIHAD AS MISTER MOWLEM BACKERS
THE HUGE ATTACK OUR VERY SPECTACULARLY TECH WHICH PREPARED SPERM SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WHICH WAS THE S. ESTIMATION OF THE BIGGEST ANOMIE OF THE TALIBAN AND AL KIND AN AFGHAN AFTER MUCH SUITS IT LEADER OF SOME AWESOME OR LINES
HIS NATION WAS DONE BY I AM FALSE T. V. CREW WHICH HAD EXPLOSIVES AND ITS CAMERA WHICH I REALLY CAME FROM CELLS HEIRESS AND BRUSSELS SO THERE'S NOT MUCH NEW AND THEN IT'S LIKE IT REALLY UNIMAGINABLE THAT LIKE ONE OF THE MAIN SUSPECT THE ONLY SURVIVING MEMBER AFTER NOVEMBER A TEXAN PARROTS ARE MANAGED ASHORE HIRED FOR FOUR MONTHS
LIKE A COUPLE OF METRE AWAY FROM HIS KAREN'S HOUSE IN MOULD THEM AND ON THE SITE OF CELLAR SALOME THERE'S ALSO A SUGGESTION I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN IT PUBLISHED IN LA MOM THIS MORNING THAT ACTUALLY THE QUESTIONING OF HIM SEEMS TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY LACK DAYS ARE CALLED SLOW AND FOCUSING ON WHAT NEEDED TO BE FOCUSED ON
IT'S THE STAGE AGAIN I CAN'T BE VERY DIPLOMATIC I MEAN WHEN I WRITE ABOUT US YESTERDAY THIS CONFERENCE A PICTURE FROM THIS MAJOR SUSPECT INTO ABATED BY BOTTOM POLICE FOR TWO HOURS
ONLY FOR TWO HOURS AND NOBODY NOBODY ASKED HIM ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN BRUSSELS WHEN HE SAYS IT WHEN HE DENIES KNOWING TOO OFTEN MADE MAIN ATTACK OURSELF FROM LAST WEEK'S ATTACKS AND BRUSSELS OR BELLS AND POLICE
SIMPLY DOESN'T ASK AN OPPRESSION SAYS FINE YOU DON'T KNOW THOSE GUYS STILL TOTALLY FOCUSING ON WHAT HAPPENED IN PARIS IN NOVEMBER INSTEAD OF KEEPING THIS GUY HIM AND A PRESSURE FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS TO TO TALK ABOUT
POSSIBLE FUTURE ATTACKS AND TO DISMANTLE ZEY ARE STILL EXISTING NETWORK IS IT POSSIBLE IN YOUR I MEAN COULD YOU GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE INCOMPETENCE IN THE INITIAL QUESTIONING OF CELLAR OH MIGHT HAVE LED IN SOME WHALE MIGHT HAVE ENABLED THAT THOSE AWFUL ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS TO GO AHEAD THEY COULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED IF HE'D BEEN MORE STRONGLY QUESTION THAT'S NOT UP TO ME ABOUT WHEN ME AND SOME COMICS AS RAT WAS A PRODUCT CALLED SIMPLY STUMPED
AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE SERGEANT ARMY QUESTION A SUSPECT
WEST BEEN ARRESTED WESTERN RESPONSIBLE FOR MAJOR ATTACKS IN THE PAST BUT WHO HAS KNOWN ASSOCIATES SOME OF THEM AT LARCH YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE PROTECTORS AND THE RICH YOU'D FOCUS MORE
IN THIS KIND OF EMERGENCY STATION OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT THERE'S THEM WHAT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO I MEAN HE'S IN CUSTODY HE COULD HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS LIKELY WILL BE QUESTION FOR WEEKS
BUT I MEAN THE FIRST THING YOU OBVIOUSLY WOULD DO WOULD ASK WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE ARE STILL AT LARGE SUGAR DOCTOR AS AN ELDER FRY AWAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THIS MORNING
IT'S SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT HERE ON O'CONNELL STREET IN DUBLIN LAST MINUTE PREPARATIONS ARE BEING MADE FOR AN ACTIVE NATIONAL COMMEMORATION AND CELEBRATION WHAT IS SIMPLY CALLED THE RISING THERE'S NORMALLY BUSY SHOPPING STREET HAS BEEN FILLED WITH T. V. TRUCKS
SEATING FOR THE PARADES TO COME AND SOUVENIR SELLERS ALL HERE TO MARK A HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE BUILDING I'M LOOKING AT THE G.P.O. WAS OCCUPIED BY REVOLUTIONARIES SET ON THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF BRITISH RULE
THE NEWS OF THEIR DARING AND HAVE THEIR CLAIM TO HAVE ESTABLISHED AN INDEPENDENT IRELAND CAME IN A SIMPLE MESSAGE SENT BY A SHORT WAVE RADIO IN MORSE CODE
IRISH REPUBLIC DECLARED AN DUBHLAN TODAY
IRISH TROOPS HAVE CAPTURED THE CITY ABERRANT FULL POSSESSION ENEMY CANNOT MOVE IN CITY THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS RISING
FROM THAT MOMENT A CENTURY AGO TO THIS
IT WAS TO BE KNOWN SIMPLY AS THE RISING A EUPHEMISM OF COURSE FOR WHAT WAS AN ARMED AND BLOODY INSURRECTION AGAINST THE HATED OCCUPIERS THAT HATED OPPRESSORS THE BRITISH
THE MESSAGE COULD ONLY BE SENT THANKS TO AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD ELECTRICIAN FROM LONDON A BOY FROM AN IRISH FAMILY WHO'D SAILED ACROSS THE SEA TO JOIN THE IRISH REBELS HIS JOB TO FIX THEIR BROKEN TRANSMITTER
I WAS CATHERINE OR FROM BIRD QUOITS YOU CROP OR IS MY IRISH LANGUAGE NAME WITCHERY USE MOST OF THE TIME MY FATHER WAS JOHN O'CONNOR WHO FOUGHT IN THE JEEP
DURING THE NINETEEN SIXTEEN RISING AND HE PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE AT THE G.P.O. HE MESSAGE THAT WAS SENT YES SO THEY HAD TO GROW UNDER ROOF CLIMB OPENED AND CLIMB UP THE POLE FIXED THE HAUNTING
SOMEBODY RECENTLY TOLD ME IT WAS LASHING RAIN AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT IS TRUE OR NOT WHETHER HE WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE A REALLY EXOTIC
FATHER WAS A VERY PROUD PEOPLE HAVE SENDING THAT LETS HE READ IT OFF THE IDEA THAT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING GOOD FOR THIS COUNTRY FOR MOST THE THOUSANDS WHO WILL LINE THE STREETS HERE THIS WEEK THE PAST
IS JUST THAT SOMETHING TO BE REMEMBERED COMMEMORATED CELEBRATED FOR A FEW THOUGH THE PAST REMAINS THE INSPIRATION THE JUSTIFICATION FOR FUTURE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO COMPLETE THE JOB
WHICH THE RISING BEGAN THERE'S LOT OF SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO'LL BE ENGAGING WITH NINETEEN SIXTEEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S THE LESS A NEW THING THEY SHOULD LEARN FROM IT MY WAY OF SEEING AS I OWN THIS HOUSE WHEN IT WAS DERREN DEAL
IT'S ONE OF THEM COMES IN STARTS BOSSING ME AROUND
TAKES OVER WOODEN DAY BE SORT OF ENTITLED TO GET THIS RUSHING AND SAY SORRY DOCTOR
THEY SHOULD FIGHT FOR THEIR INDEPENDENCE
SEE IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HATE ENGLAND IT JUST YOU TRYING TO SHOW THEM LOOK STAY FOR YOU BE LONG PLEASE LEAVE US ALONE YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH TROUBLE OVER HERE IS IT ALL IN THE PAST WAS IT HISTORY OR UNFIT IT'S UNFINISHED BUSINESS BROUGHT OUT INTO THOSE WHO CAN SEE
THAT WE'RE ON THE ROAD NOW LITTER FREE WALK PROPERLY HOPEFULLY WE BRING SOMETHING ABOUT
AND THERE ARE OTHERS THAT WILL HAVE TO BASH HIM THEN THAT'S NOT THE RISING IS OF COURSE NOT THE MERE HISTORY NOTHING IN THIS COUNTRY IS IT'S THE FIRST THE CONTESTED AND CONTROVERSIAL CHAPTER IN THE STORY OF IRELAND AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE
AND ONE OF THE G.P.O. WITNESS HISTORY DARA GOOD TO SEE YOU AND EVEN OUTSIDE HERE YOU GET A REMINDER OF NINETEEN SIXTEEN ABSOLUTELY THIS WERE UNDER THE PORTICO OF THE GENERAL POST OFFICE THE MOST ICONIC BUILDING YOUR OWN DUBLIN'S O'CONNELL STREET THE WIDER STREET IN DUBLIN
THERE ARE STILL POP RODS FROM THE BULLETS THAT WERE FIRED WE DO WE HAVE THEM BULLET MARKS FROM ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE G.P.O. BUILDING ITSELF SURVIVED THE NINETEEN SIXTEEN RISING AND THE INSIDE IS STILL A FUNCTIONING POST OFFICE ISN'T IT HERE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY FUNCTIONING FALSTAFF AS LARGE AS POST OFFICE IN THE COUNTRY BUT NOW AND SEEM TO BE A MUSIC
SO WE HAVE G.P.O. WITNESS HISTORY ON TWO LEVELS ARE FULLY IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE OF IT THE NINETEEN SIXTEEN RISING IRISHMAN LAMB FROM ON
ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT AND DIE FOR JUSTICE FOR ARAN YOU WERE LOOKING AT ONE OF THE BARRICADES THAT THE REBELS ARE DIRECTED HERE IS THE FURNITURE OF THE G.P.O. ITSELF TO BARRICADE THE WINDOWS THEY WILL BE SECURE WE HAVE SOME LEE ENFIELD RIFLES AT THE REBELS THEMSELVES WOULD HAVE USED HERE THE HARDEST THING IF YOU'RE DOING A NEW MUSEUM ABOUT SUCH CONTENTIOUS HISTORICAL EVENT
IS TO CAPTURE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE OFTEN SEEN AS HEROES
HOW DO YOU DO THAT HERE IN THIS MUSIC WE DO THAT BY BEING TOTALLY FAIR WE HAVE DISPLAYS IN THE MUSEUM ABOUT THE NUMBER OF WHOEVER KILLED THE MAJORITY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE NINETEEN SIXTY NOISY ARE INNOCENT CIVILIAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FORTY CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED AND WE SAID THE NINETEEN SIXTEEN RISING IS NOT JUST ABOUT THIS GLORIOUS INSURRECTION AGAINST BRITAIN THE NINETEEN SIXTEEN RISING BLOGS EVERYBODY A VERY CLEAR TO BE NEUTRAL BETTER THAN AIRFLOW STEADILY ANY TREE
THE FACES OF THE SEVEN LEADERS OF THE RISING THE WORDS OF THE PROCLAMATION OF THOSE WHO STYLED THEMSELVES THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE IRISH REPUBLIC
HAD BEEN PRINTED AND STITCHED INTO COMMEMORATIVE POSTERS AND SCARVES WE HAVE THE PROCLAMATION AND MAKE A COLOUR AND THEN A LEADERS
DO YOU NORMALLY A FRUIT VEGETABLE BUT IT'S START ICKLE EVENT SO WE HAVE TO GO WITH THE FLOW
DO YOU GET YOUR TANGERINE BANANAS AND A FLAG REMEMBERING THE REBEL LEADERS AND ANITA LILY NICE TALKING TO YOU GOOD RAVEN TOMMY GRAHAM THE EDITOR OF HISTORY ISLAND MAGAZINE JOIN ME AT THE MARKET ON MORE STREET JUST ROUND THE CORNER FROM THE G.P.O. THE POPULATION WILL BE OUR EQUIVALENT OF THE AMERICAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE I LIKE ALSO DOCUMENTS IT'S BRIEF
AND IT'S A VERY STIRRING DOCUMENT HAVE BEEN IT'S VERY WELL WRITTEN IT STARTS OFFERED IRISH MEN AND IRISH WOMEN SO IT EXPLICITLY RECOGNISE AS THE WHOLE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT IT'S FULL A VERY POSITIVE IDEAS WHICH PEOPLE STILL FIND A RESONANCE WITH
MY REGULAR BUTCHER SHOP DOWN THE STREET HERE BY THE WAY AND THEY HAVE GOT SOME GO TO KIND OF PAINT UP A PROCLAMATION A LIST THIS TOOK A LOT OF BOTHER AND TIME TO DO WHAT I'D SAY HALF OF HIS CUSTOMERS ARE I'M NOT IRISH AT ALL THEY RESPOND TO AT THE HER ROLES AS A MARVELLOUS I MEAN CONTRADICTIONS ARE ALL SORT OF DETAILS ABOUT US WHICH MAY BE SLIGHTLY DARKER NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE HAVING A GOAL FOR THEIR RIGHTS FOR THE FREEDOM IT'S VERY HARD STORY TO RESIST
THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING IN HERE TO GET THEIR MINCED LAMB OF THE LIVER YOU GET PEOPLE STOPPING AND READING THE WORDS THE PROCLAMATION IS ALL PART OF LOVE THAT PEOPLE COME AND STOP LOOKING AT THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR BUT NOW DON'T LOOK AT THE PICTURES LIKE UP THERE WHILE IT DOES THIS HAVE A REAL MEANING TEA AND TELL ME WHERE ARE YOU FROM ORIGINALLY
O.K. SO I WAS A MOLDOVAN YOU CAN IDENTIFY WITH THEIR NINETEEN SIXTEEN REBEL LEADERS
WILL YOU BE CELEBRATING AS WE CAN OF COURSE BUS THEY GIVE YOU ANYTHING ELSE NOT AT IT
ON THE RIGHT OF THE BUILDINGS THAT THE INSURGENCE OCCUPIED FOR ABOUT A DAY SO THE LAST HEADQUARTERS IF YOU LIKE OF THE REBELS AS UP HERE SO IT HAS BEEN DECLARED A NATIONAL MONUMENT BECAUSE THE FACT THAT THE REBELLION ENDED HERE ALLOWS ITS CRITICS TO SAY IT WAS A FAILED REBELLION DIDN'T WORK IT DIDN'T SUCCEED WHERE HE FAILED THE SHORTER BUT WOULD SUCCEED IN THE LONG TERM I MEAN WHAT WAS A MILITARY FAILURE BECAME A PROPAGANDA SUCCESS
PROOF YOU FOR THOSE WHO STILL CELEBRATE THE MEN WHO FOUGHT AND KILLED AND DIED FOR THE MODERN I.R.A. IT STILL HAS PROPAGANDA VALUE
WHAT'S RESONATE IS AGAINST THIS WALL WHICH IS A HISTORIC MONUMENTS WE'VE GOT THE EXECUTIONS OF THE REBEL LEADERS IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN BUT THERE IS A QUOTE FROM BOBBY SANDS YES THE HUNGER STRIKER FROM THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES A REVENGE WILL BE IN THE LAUGHTER OF OUR CHILDREN
SOME FEAR THAT THESE CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS OF THE RISING COULD BE USED BY THOSE WHO STILL ADVOCATE VIOLENCE AS THE WAY TO GET THE BRITS OUT OF IRELAND ALL OF IT NORTH AS WELL HERSELF
SO THIS DEGREE OF GEORGE LOVE THE FIFTEEN KINGS OR SERIOUS AND HE WAS TWENTY EIGHT WHEN HE DIED HE WAS A BRITISH SOLDIER DOCTOR ELAINE BRAIN IS A HISTORIAN AND COLUMNIST WITH THE SUNDAY BUSINESS POST SHE WAS MY GUIDE AT THE ARBOUR HILL CEMETERY IN DUBLIN WE LITERALLY STANDING ON THE GRAVES OF HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF BRITISH SOLDIERS
SOLDIERS WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS THE OPPRESSORS OF THE REBEL LEADERS SOLDIERS WHO WERE THE ENEMIES OF THE REBEL LEADERS AND THE IRONY OF IRISH HISTORY GENERALLY IS THAT OF THE REBELS ARE BURIED IN THE SAME SPACERS OR THE BRITISH SOLDIERS YOU'VE WRITTEN OF YOUR WORRIES
ABOUT THIS COMMEMORATION OF THE EASTER RISING WHAT WHAT CONCERNS YOU I THINK IRISH PEOPLE HAVE A VERY AMBIGUOUS VIEW ABOUT VIOLENCE AND I THINK A LOT OF IRISH PEOPLE ARE FEARFUL THAT THIS IS A COMMEMORATION OF A PERIOD OF IRISH HISTORY BUT NOT A CELEBRATION OF VIOLENCE
AND THIS KIND OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW WE VIEW VIOLENCE AND IRISH HISTORY IS SOMETHING THAT'S DEEPLY INGRAINED IN US AND THIS SOMETIMES DIVIDES FAMILY YOUR OWN FAMILY SWORD THIS AMBIGUITY REALLY
MOTHER SO MY GREAT GRANDFATHER IN WORLD WAR ONE ON THE DAY OF THE EASTER RISING HE WAS GASSED ALONG WOULD FIVE HUNDRED OF HIS COMPATRIOTS ON MY FATHER SIDE MY GRAND UNCLE WHO LIVED LITERALLY A STONE'S THROW FROM HERE HAVE YOU HEARD THESE MEN BEEN SCHANCHE JOINED UP AND BECAME
A PART OF MICHAEL COLLINS'S INTELLIGENCE SQUAD SO ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FAMILY HAD A MAN WEARING A BRITISH ARMY UNIFORM AND ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAD A MAN KILLED PEOPLE WEARING BRITISH ARMY UNIFORMS AND YOU WERE BOTH TO BE REMEMBER THIS EAST ABSOLUTELY
ISLANDS LEADERS ARE AT PAINS TO STRESS THEY'VE LEARNED THE LESSONS OF THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY WHICH UNION IS LIKE DAVID TRIMBLE HAD BLAMED FOR HELPING TO LIGHT A FUSE WHICH LED TO DECADES OF SECTARIAN MURDER AND MAYHEM OR WHAT THEY CALL THE TROUBLES
ANOTHER EUPHEMISM MOST CELEBRATING THIS ANNIVERSARY SEE THE MEN WHO FOUGHT IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN AS HEROES PLAIN AND SIMPLE THIS IS A SECTION OF DADDY'S MEMOIRS MEN LIKE THE YOUNG ELECTRICIAN FROM LONDON
THE CITY WAS IN DARKNESS AND THE ONLY LOUNGE WAS OUT OF DON'T BURNING JEEP IT ALL REFLECTED ON THE WINDOWS ACROSS MOST RICHE AT ABOUT THREE A.M. THE FIRE REACHED THE EXPLOSIVES IN THE CELLAR
AND THE RESULTANT BLUSHED WORSE TOO
BRITISH TROOPS HAVE BEEN REPULSED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER AT THE ATTACK
THE ARROW'S POSITION
THE PEOPLE ARE WILDLY ENTHUSIASTIC FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT

SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER JOINED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AT A VIGIL IN GLASGOW LAST NIGHT FOR A MUSLIM'S SHOPKEEPER WHO WAS KILLED IN WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A RELIGIOUSLY PREJUDICED ATTACK A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD MUSLIM MAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED
COMMEMORATIONS WILL TAKE PLACE IN DUBLIN TO MARK ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE ISLANDS EASTER RISING A WREATH WILL BE LAID IN THE CITY'S GARDEN OF REMEMBRANCE TO HONOUR THOSE WHO DIED IN THE SIX DAY BATTLE
THE ROLLING STONES WHO PLAYED AN HISTORIC FREE CONCERT IN FRONT OF AN ESTIMATED HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN CUBA THEIR MUSIC WAS CONSIDERED SUBVERSIVE AND BANNED UNDER THE ISLAND'S COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES
IT'S NOW A TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE O'CLOCK THE DARKEST WEEK IN THE HISTORY OF DUBLIN THAT'S THE HEADLINE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE IRISH TIMES TODAY IT IS THOUGH CAPTURING NOT TODAY'S NEWS BUT THE EVENTS IT REPORTED A CENTURY AGO WHAT IS NOW KNOWN SIMPLY AS THE RISING BACK THEN THE PAPER DESCRIBED WHAT IT CALLED AN ORGY OF FIRE AND SLAUGHTER
THE ASSAULT NOT JUST ON THE G.P.O. BUILDING WHICH IS JUST DOWN THE STREET WHERE I'M BROADCASTING FROM BUT ON BRITISH TARGETS ALL OVER THIS CITY
I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THE IRISH PRESIDENT MICHAEL D. HIGGINS HE IS NOT JUST THE COUNTRY'S HEAD OF STATE HE'S ALSO AN ACADEMIC HISTORIAN I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CONCERNS OF THOSE WHO THINK THAT THESE EVENTS IN BODY AND AMBIGUITY IN ATTITUDES TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE WITH THE RESPECT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE VIOLENCE OF EMPIRE
THE VIOLENCE OF INSURRECTION YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE VIOLENCE THAT IS ORGANISED THROUGH ARMED FORCES WASHING FLAT SET OFF FOR LIKE THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE ISN'T JUST THE ACTS WITHIN EAST TO EAT THEMSELVES BUT IT IS THE RESPONSE TO IT THE EXECUTION
DUBHLAN A PART OF THE POPULATION WAS LIVING IN WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS POVERTY WORSE THAN CAIRO EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE TWENTY FAMILIES LIVING IN ONE ROOM
IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN YOU WERE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EVENT BEFORE NINETEEN SIXTEEN AND THAT WAS THE GREAT LOCKER USH WILLIAM MARTIN MURPHY SPORT TO FURTHER AND PLIERS CLOSED OUT THE WORKERS NOW AFTER THE LOCKER RUSH SOME PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED BACK TO WORK MANY OF THEM JOINED THE BRITISH
I HAVE IN SOME OF MY SPEECH IS POINTED OUT THAT MORE IRISH PEOPLE DIED IN THAT WEEK MORE IN THE GREAT WAR IN OTHER WORDS DOWN IN THE SLIGHTLY MORE YES OF COURSE YOU WOULD HAVE OF COURSE THE LAST OF THOUSANDS IN THE SONG SO THEY'LL BE APPOINTED RECOGNISING THIS I ASSUME IS TO SAY TO PEOPLE NORTH AND SOUTH IN THIS ISLAND
THERE ARE OTHER COMMEMORATIONS TO BE HAD NOW YOU MAY BE REMEMBERING THE PEOPLE WHO DONE WHAT I HAVE HERE IN THE GREAT WAR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IRISH PEOPLE AND WON IT BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY THOUSAND WE KNOW DIED I'VE COURSE RECALLED THAT BUT I DO SAY THIS WHICH IS IMPORTANT IF I OPEN THE CATEGORIES OF HISTORY TO DEAL WITH IT I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO OPEN THE CATEGORIES OF EMPIRE AS WELL
THEY ARE INFORMED BY AN IMPERIAL ATTITUDE NOW SOME POLITICIANS IN THE NORTH HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE ANNIVERSARY MIGHT BE USED AS AN EXCUSE BY MEN OF VIOLENCE TO CLAIM THAT THEY WERE DRAWING THEIR INSPIRATION FROM THE MEN WHO FOUGHT IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WE ARE HAVING IN NORTHERN IRELAND I WOULD HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL APPROACH THIS COMMEMORATION AND WE'D BE ABLE TO DO SO GENEROUS IT IS RESPONSIBLE I THINK NOT TO BE SEEING FEAR WHERE THERE ARE NONE
ASSERTIVELY DID THE PEACE PROCESS IS SUPPORTED BY MORE THAN EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS ISLAND IT IS A FRAGILE PEACE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK OUT ALL OF THE TIME WHEN YOU VISITED THE U.K. IF YOUR STATE VISIT YOU SAID THERE WAS STILL A ROAD TO BE TRAVEL
TO REACH PEACE YEAH YOU SOUND VERY CONFIDENT NOW BUT DO YOU STILL THINK THERE'S SOME WORK TO OH OF COURSE THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE VERY PARTICULARLY ON I'M NOT HAPPY WITH ITS SEPARATE EDUCATION OR NOT NOW AND WOULDN'T BE COMING FROM OUTSIDE SAY THAT WE REALLY GOT A PROCESS OF RELATIVE PEACE AND NOT MUCH RECONCILIATION IT'LL BE PESSIMISTIC AND WRONG
THERE IS A REALLY RICH CONCILIATION GOING ON EVEN BETWEEN THESE COMMUNAL ABSOLUTELY DO YOU DADDY TOGETHER I MEET THEM ALL THE TIME IN RELATION TO FOR EXAMPLE IN RELATION TO SPORT IN RELATION TO CULTURE IN RELATION TO KARMA FOR YOU YOU DON'T KEEP PICKING AT THE SOURCES OF DIVISION TO UNDERMINE WHAT IN FACT PROGRESS YOU'RE MAKING IN THE PRESENT IN TERMS OF RECONCILIATION THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING POINT TO MAKE OWNED THIS WEEKEND OF ALL WEEK YES BECAUSE SOME WOULD SAY
AND I KNOW YOU DISAGREE BUT SOME WOULD SAY THAT COMMEMORATING THIS ACT OF VIOLENCE
IS IN A SENSE A SOURCE OF DIVISION BECAUSE IT ENCOURAGES SOME PEOPLE TO THINK THIS STATE IS FOUND IT THROUGH VIOLENCE WHEN WE DECIDE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE LET HER SPEAK IN THE VIOLENCE OF THE VIOLENCE OF STATE
THE VIOLENCE OF THOSE OF INSURRECTION YES LET'S DO IT ALL BUT IN THE NEXT PART OF THAT I THINK THAT MY TREAT THIS IS ABOUT WHICH THERE IS NO AGREEMENT NOT SOUTH IN BRITAIN AND IN EUROPE IN THE EIGHTIES
THE LEAST GIFT YOU COULD GIVE HIS TO AN EFFECTIVE FOAL SEVEN EASIER HOW CAN YOU SAY TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS LOST A LOVED ONE ARE SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN IN A WHEELCHAIR IS THE RESULT OF AN INJURY TO PUT IT ALL BEHIND YOU
I'VE JUST BEEN INTERVIEWING TONY BLAIR AND HE SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER DROP A GOD HE IS NERVOUS IN OTHER WORDS AT ALL THOUGH THE SITUATION IN THE NORTH IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS THERE ARE STILL REASONS FOR RINGS
OH I THINK THAT CERTAINLY DISH ONE IF IT SHOULD NOT TAKE RISKS WITH SECURITY AND I THINK I SHOULD WE HAVE SO MUCH TO BUILD ON BUT WE HAVE A FOUNDATION
DO YOU WORRY THAT IF BRITAIN CHOOSES TO LEAVE THE E.U. THAT THAT WILL HEART AND A BORDER BUT HE'S GOT MORE POROUS
LESS IMPORTANT IN RECENT YEARS I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR ME AS HEAD OF STATION
TO COMMENT ON ON REALLY WHAT IS A MASHER FED TO BRITISH PAPER TO DECIDE YOU HAD SOME POWERFUL WORDS WHEN YOU SPOKE IN LONDON TO BE AUTHENTICALLY IRISH WE MUST ALSO EMBRACE A EUROPEAN IDENTITY IT AND IT'S IN THAT EUROPEAN CONTEXT OF MUTUALITY AND INTERDEPENDENCE THAT WE AND YOU WENT BRITAIN AND IRELAND TOOK THE MOST SIGNIFICANT STEPS TOWARDS EACH OTHER WHAT WE USE
I WAS REFERRING TO THE BUILDING OF PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN WHICH I DO AGREE IS AN ONGOING PROJECT BECAUSE AT THE TOP WE'LL GIVE TO PEOPLE IS TO SHAKE HANDS ON A CONSTITUTION AND ACCOMMODATION OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO GET IT TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY AND THIS IS WHERE WE WANT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE
I THINK THERE WERE TIMES DURING THE PEACE BRASSES THAT ENDED IN THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT WHEN THOSE WHO WEAR DIRECTLY SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER BROKE DOWN
AND THAT WAS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT WAS DID TO YOU YOU HAD A SECRETARIAT THAT KEPT PRODUCING TEXT AND EVEN JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THEY YOU HAD PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE
WHO WERE COMING IN TO HELP IF YOU LIKE PUT IT INTO PLACE NOW YOU ARE USING THESE COMMEMORATIONS IN PART TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT MODERN ISLAND YES NOT SIMPLY TO REMEMBER HISTORY
YOU'VE TALKED OF MAKING THE COUNTRY WORTHY OF NINETEEN SIXTY WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN PEOPLE REFER TO THE PROCLAMATION THEY'RE SPEAKING ABOUT THE DOCUMENT IT WAS READ OUT ONTO THE PORCH OF DEGENERATE PASSED OFF US AS PATRICK PEARSE ANNOUNCED AN IRISH REPUBLIC FIRST OF ALL THE USE OF THE WORD REPUBLIC IS SIGNIFICANT TO MIXTURE ISN'T SAID OF ENLIGHTENMENT THINKING SUMMER ROMANTICISM STRONG NATIONALISM
WHAT I'M INTERESTED IT IS TAKING THEIR EGALITARIAN POSH ENOUGH
IT SPEAKS FOR EXAMPLE OF EQUALITY BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN CIVIL AND POLITICAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL EQUALITY THEY'RE ALL BASICALLY THEY'RE THE NINETEEN SIXTEEN PRINCIPLES
NOT LIVED UP TO IT WORK THAT IN THE SENSE OF THE STATE THAT WAS LATER CREATED WAS A DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE STATE AND ONE THAT GAVE WOMEN VERY LIMITED RIGHT
AND WHAT I'D SUGGEST IS AS I LOOK AT THE CONSTITUTION THAT ARE ESTABLISHED IN THE STATES THEY WERE COMING OUT OF HIM IN A WAY IT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS AND PERIOD POWER INTO THE ELITES IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES THAT OFTEN TO FIND THE GAP BETWEEN IF YOU LIKE POPULAR A PACKED EMANCIPATION AND THE NEW STATE
YOU WANT TO SHOW I THINK THAT THIS COUNTRY CAN REMEMBER ITS HISTORY BUT NOT BE TRAPPED HOW OH I THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT I THINK YOU MUSTN'T BECOME A PRISONER OF THE PAST YOU MUSTN'T ALLOW IF YOU'RE LIKE ANY DISTORTIONS OF HISTORY
SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PERHAPS YOU'RE SAYING THIS IT IS SIMPLY TOO CRUDE TO SAY THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED PURELY BY VIOLENT REVOLUTIONARIES THAT WOULD BE CRUDE VERSION OF HISTORY BUT TO IGNORE THAT
THAT REVOLUTION PLAYED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE TO DISMISS IT WOULD EQUALLY BE STUPID AND
I THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE EVENTS OF NINETEEN SIXTEEN AND YES I DO TINK THAT WITHOUT NINETEEN SIXTEEN AND THE EVENTS INSTEAD SURROUNDED WE WOULD NOT HAVE ACHIEVED OUR INDEPENDENCE WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT I HAVEN'T THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR WHAT HAD BEEN ACHIEVED FOR IRISH PEOPLE IN THE PARLIAMENTARY TRADITION WHICH WAS OFTEN BRILLIANT WHICH BUT IT SEEMED IT HAD RUN OUT BUT THE EVENTS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NOT JUST NINETEEN SIXTY THE REACTION TO IT
AND A TREF CONSCRIPTION CHANGED EVERYTHING MY PRESENT THANK YOU VERY YOU'RE FOREVER
THERE WE ARE SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO KNOT IT OH YES WELL I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WERE GOING TO SAY SOMETHING THEN THEY WHAT I THINK'S A BIT OF A DELAY ON THE LINE SO YOU CARRY ON
THANK YOU FOR THAT JUST YOU KNOW I THINK I PROBABLY SAID MORE OF THE DOOR LET'S HEAR FROM LET'S HEAR FROM WHAT'S IN THE PAPERS WE WERE HERE IN WHAT IN THE IRISH PAPERS LET'S HEAR A LITTLE OF WHAT'S IN THE U.K. PAPERS THIS MORNING THE INDEPENDENT HAS PUBLISHED ITS LAST PRINT EDITION AND THERE THIS IS ITS FINAL FRONT PAGE HEADLINE REVEALED BRITISH CONNECTION IN PLOT TO KILL A SAUDI KING
THE PAPER REPORTS THE LONDON BASED SAUDI DISSIDENT HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF HAVING A ROLE IN AN AUDACIOUS IT ORDERED BY THE FORMER LIBYAN LEADER COLONEL GADDAFI ON KING ABDULLAH MOHAMMED ALMAS SARI DESCRIBES THE CLAIMS AS ABSURD BUT THE PAPER SAYS HE'S BEING PURSUED THROUGH THE U.K. COURTS
BY THE NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY IN A TEX INQUIRY INTENDED TO RETRIEVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS HE ALLEGEDLY RECEIVED FROM THE LIBYANS THE GUARDIAN IN AN EDITORIAL MARKING THE INDEPENDENTS DEMISE SAYS IT LACKS ANY SCHADENFREUDE
THE INDIE WAS A GALLANT PAPER IT SAYS A CLASS ACT THERE BUT FOR THE GRACE OF THE DIGITAL GODS GO ALL OF US THE TIMES HAS THE HEADLINE CITY TO CASH IN ON YOU VOTED SAYS HEDGE FUNDS ARE PREPARING TO USE PRIVATE EXIT POLLS ON REFERENDUM DAY TO GET AN EARLY INDICATION OF THE RESULT AND THEN TO STAND TO MAKE A KILLING ON THE CURRENCY MARKETS IT SAYS TRADERS WANT TO EXPLOIT A LOOPHOLE IN ELECTORAL LAW
ALTHOUGH IT'S ILLEGAL TO PUBLISH THE RESULTS OF EXIT POLLS WHILE POLLING IS TAKING PLACE IS NOTHING TO STOP PEOPLE COMMISSIONING POLES FOR THEIR OWN USE THE DAILY EXPRESS IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES LEAD ON THE LIST OF BUSINESS LEADERS BACKING THE VOTE LEAVE GROUP THE F. T. SAYS THE INCLUSION OF A FORMER H.S.B.C. CHIEF EXECUTIVE MICHAEL GEGEN IS A SURPRISE HERE'S COUNTRY THE ANTI YEAH CONSENSUS AMONG TOP CITY BANKERS THE PAPER SAYS
THE KILLING OF THE SHOPKEEPER A CHAR IN GLASGOW IS THE MAIN STORY IN THE DAILY MAIL MURDER OF A MAN A P. SAYS THE HEADLINE THE PAPER DESCRIBED MY AS A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MOSLEM AND SAYS HE WAS KILLED AFTER WISHING FRIENDS ARE VERY HAPPY EASTER POLICE ARE QUESTIONING A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD MAN
DAILY MIRROR SAYS THE POPE TRIED TO HALT LAST NIGHT'S ROLLING STONES' GIG IN CUBA THE VATICAN SUGGESTED THE BAN SHOULD START AT MIDNIGHT TO AVOID PLAYING ON GOOD FRIDAY ACCORDING TO THE MIRROR TOUR INSIDER IS QUOTED SAYING THE BAND'S TEAM WAS FLABBERGASTED COULDN'T BELIEVE THEIR EYES WHEN THE VATICAN GOT IN TOUCH BY LETTER
MATTHEW PARRIS USES HIS COLUMN IN THE TIMES TO SCORN BORIS JOHNSON THERE'S A PATTERN TO BORIS'S LIFE SINCE THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE M.P. WHICH YOU BE MARKED OUT IN RED WARNING INK IT'S THE CASUAL DISHONESTY THE CRUELTY THE BETRAYAL AND BENEATH THAT THE TRAIL THE EMPTINESS OF REAL AMBITION AMBITION TO DO ANYTHING USEFUL WITH OFFICE WANTS IT'S ATTAINED WE SHOULD END OUR AFFAIR HE SAYS WITH THIS DANGEROUS CHARM
BUT I'M FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WHY ARE SO MANY ISLAMIST TERRORISTS BROTHERS THE BACKPACK RAILWAYS WHO MURDERED PEOPLE IN BRUSSELS AIRPORT AND THE METRO STATION THE LATEST IN A LONG LIST BROTHERS INVOLVED AS WELL IN THE PARIS ATTACKS IN THE CHARLIE ABDO MURDERS IN THE KILLINGS AT THE BOSTON MARATHON DOCTOR MOHAMMED HAVE FAIRS IS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AT THE NAVAL POST GRADUATE SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON D.C. AND STUDIES SIBLING TERRORISM
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS FOR A TERRACE IS STILL FINE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RELIABLE AND THAT HE COULD TRUST IN THE CONTEXT OF A TERRORIST CONSPIRACY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THERE OUR WORK HERE IS ONE TIGHT COURSE ASSOCIATIONS ALPINE YEARS OF LIVING TOGETHER A FAMILY BARNS OF TRUST THEN
OH THAT MAKES THEIR INDIVIDUAL WHO'S BEING RECRUITED MORE RECEPTIVE ALL TO HEAR IN THE RADICAL MESSAGE AS OPPOSED TO HEARING IT FROM A STRANGER
AND SECONDLY THE BONDS OF LOYALTY BETWEEN FAMILY MEMBERS MAKES THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ACCEPTING A RADICAL MESSAGE WHEN NORMALLY THEY WERE LIKELY REJECT IT IF IT COMES FROM A STRANGER
IF ALL OF THAT IS TRUE WHAT IS THE IMPLICATION THEN WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SECURITY SERVICES DO YOU THINK WELL I THINK TERRACE ARE TURNING TO SIBLINGS FOR TWO IMPORTANT REASONS WHY WE'RE OPERATIONAL SECURITY AND THE OTHER ONE FOR FEAR OF AN INFORMANT
SO WHEN IT COMES TO INFORMANTS FAMILY MEMBERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO INFORM ARMED BROTHER AS A FATHER AS A OR WHOEVER IN THE FAMILY IT WAS RECENTLY AN ASTONISHING STATISTIC THAT CAME ACROSS IN A STADIUM LONG WOLF TAX IT'S SUGGESTED THAT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT OF LONE WOLF ATTACK OR IS THAT ONE POINT DISCUSSED DOING SOMETHING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS YET VERY FEW OF THOSE FAMILIES CAME FORWARD TO REPORT
AND THIS OBVIOUSLY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SECURITY SERVICES WHEN SOMEONE IS NOT INFORMING GIVING TIPS ON WHOSE RADICALISING THAT MAKES A TASK OF RADICALISATION QUITE DIFFICULT COUNTERING RADICALISATION RATHER QUITE DIFFICULT
THE OTHER IMPLICATION HAS TO THE OLD WAY INTO IT BIG T. INTERCEPTING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TERRORISTS ARE PROBABLY NOW INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OFFICE ARE FROM RELY ON INTEGRATING OUR INTERCEPTING MESSAGES A MINORITY US FUN BUT WON'T PILING IS TAKING PLACE IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR FINDS THAT THE HARM THAT MAKES SUCH INTERCEPTIONS VERY DIFFICULT TO COME BY
WOOD FROM YOUR INFORMATION AND YOU'RE AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA WHAT HOW ARE THE SECURITY SERVICE IS THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN THE FUTURE TO TO TO COUNTER THIS
IN THE UNITED STATES THERE IS A GREATER EMPHASIS ON WORKING DIRECTLY WITH COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT COMMUNITIES ARE CLOSER IN CONTACT WITH THEIR REMEMBERS BUT I DO THINK THAT ANOTHER POSSIBLE APPROACH IS ROWING TO TREAT THIS PHENOMENA AS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM NOT JUST AS A SECURITY PROBLEM
SO LET'S THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY IF WE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE EXPERIENCING DRUG OR ALCOHOL ALCOHOL ALCOHOLISM SOME PROBLEM WE REPORT DOWN TO TRYING TO PROVIDE THEM HELP PERHAPS WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE FAMILIES THAT SEE THEIR SON STARTERS ARE OUR CLOSE RELATIVES FIG ENOUGH SAY GOING TO SYRIA WHERE TALKING ART RAMPANT SPEAK
REPORTING THEM NOW FOR THE SAKE OF THROWING IN ME BUT FOR HER FOR A PRINT TO PROVIDE THEM HELP HELPS TO AVOID GETTING THEM DEEPER INTO THE ORBIT OF RADICALISM WHERE THE UNLIKELY INDUCT WHERE UNFORTUNATELY KILLING OTHERS IN THE PROCESS
THE HAMMER HAVE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TEN TO NINE IT IS OF A FINALE TOMORROW ONE OF THE B.B.C.'S MOST SUCCESSFUL SERIES FOR MANY A LONG YEAR THE NIGHT MANAGER ADAPTED FROM THE JOHN CURRY NOVEL OF COURSE HAS BEEN A RIP ROARING SUCCESS HUGE AUDIENCES MASSIVE CRITICAL ACCLAIM STYLISH THEY SAY GRIPPING
THERE'S TWO CHAPS YOU SMASHED UP AT THE RESTAURANT YOU KNOW THEM NO
HAVEN'T EATEN THERE BEFORE DID THEY LOOK LIKE THAT BEFORE NEVER SELL THE BOAT FOR THEM IS THIS SOME KIND OF INTERROGATION LET'S PRETEND IT IS
YOU COOK FOR THEM NO MUSCLE MARVELLOUS BY THE WAY DO YOU WANT TO LOOK OUR GUIDANCE WHICH ROLES HALFWAY THROUGH NO IT'S ALL RIGHT CORK IS OF THE THEORY LISTEN I HAVEN'T ASKED FOR ANYTHING ALL RIGHT I DON'T EXPECT A REWARD I CERTAINLY DON'T APPRECIATE THIS INVESTIGATION INTO MY PERSONAL LIFE AND FRANKLY I'M BORED OF YOUR HOSPITALITY
MAYBE I'M NOT SQUEAKY CLEAN NOR I SUSPECT ARE YOU AND YOUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE SO MAYBE JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT TOM HAD THAT HUGH LAURIE STARRING IN THE NIGHT MANAGER B. B. C. CO PRODUCTION WITH M.C. AND INK FACTORY DAVID FARR IS THE MAN WHO ADAPTED THE NOVEL WROTE THE SCREENPLAY AND IT'S HERE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING CONGRATULATIONS ON ITS SUCCESS FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE
BLOCKBUSTER YEAH BEING A BIT BEYOND WHAT I WAS IMAGINING OUT ITS I SUPPOSE I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS YOUNG THEY WERE KIND OF WHAT YOU CALL NATIONAL CONVERSATION PIECES OF T.V. LAND ACTUALLY SMILEY YES WE THOUGHT THEY WERE DEAD YOU WERE MAYBE OVER THERE STILL AT THE MOMENT I THINK PEOPLE WHO I KNOW NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INDUSTRY ANYTHING AND SHE'S COMING TO ME SAYING IT'S GREAT TO BE A TALK WHAT'S IN HER MONDAY MORNING EVERYONE VAGUE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE CHARACTERS THE CHARACTERS ARE PROBABLY LOST IN THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS FOR A WHILE WHICH WHICH IS LOVELY FOR ME COS IT WAS IN THE CARRIAGE THANK YOU I DON'T THINK THAT BOOK WAS AS AS WELL KNOWN FOR EXAMPLE IS OBVIOUSLY THIS MY NOVELS DID YOU GROW UP WITH A SMILEY NOVELS AND WITH THE T.V. ADAPTATION WITH ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS A COMER EXACTLY WHAT I'VE GOT TWELVE OR SOMETHING AND I WATCHED MY LAD STAY UP AND WATCH SMILEY'S PEOPLE WITH MY DAD I THINK I WAS INTERESTED IN THE FACT THERE WAS A PARIS WILL BE SEXING IT WAS IN THAT HE'S ENDED UP BEING REALLY MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE WATCHING ALEC GUINNESS AND BERYL REID
TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND WITH GREAT LOSS AND REGRET FOR ACTUALLY FOR A PROGRAMME THAT I HADN'T A BOOK I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY READ WHICH IS TINKER TAILOR THE WONDERFUL STUFF AND WHEN YOU CAME TO THIS AND YOU LOOKED AT IT AND YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE YOU STARTED WHAT DID YOU SEE IN IT THAT COULD WORK WELL UNLIKE THE SMILEY NOVELS I I THOUGHT THERE WAS THIS VERY CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL ANGER IN THE BOOK WHICH IS UNUSUAL AND I SAW IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT WAIT I WANT TO UPDATE IT FROM THEM FOR THE NINETIES WHAT WE SHOULD WHEN HE WROTE IT
I THOUGHT THAT THE THING THAT REALLY ATTRACTED ME TO IT WITH A CHARACTER WHICH IS THE GREATER COURAGE GIFT HE'S A GENIUS FOR CHARACTER PSYCHOLOGY THOSE THERE'S TWO LEAD MEN PINE AND ROPER AND WHAT WAS INITIALLY A MAMBA NOW WOMAN IN THE ADAPTATION ANGELA BRRR THAT TRINITY IF YOU LIKE THE SORT OF FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES IN THE GOOD ANGEL
THAT I KNEW WAS JUST A ROBUST PSYCHOLOGICAL STRUCTURE I CAN WORK FROM IT'S FANTASTIC CHARACTER AS YOU MENTIONED THEY WAS DEEPLY POLITICAL WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE CARRIAGE IS CRITICS IS THAT ACTUALLY IT'S POLITICAL TO AN EXTENT THAT IT'S HACKNEYED AND THAT THE THAT THE BADDIES ARE ALWAYS SILENT M.I.SIX AND WESTERN GOVERNMENTS AND THE AMERICANS AND MULTINATIONALS AND ALL THE REST
WOULD THEY HAVE THEY'RE A BIT SICK OF US BEATING OURSELVES UP DO YOU DO YOU SEE IT IN THOSE TERMS IT'S A SCENE IN THOSE TERMS I THINK I THINK IT'S UNFAIR I THINK THERE'S A GREAT BRITISH TRADITION OF
CRITIQUING OUR OWN ROLE IN WELL PAT QUITE RIGHTLY GIVEN OUR COLONIAL PAST ME TO ADMIT THAT SO I THINK LITERATURE AND CULTURE IS THERE TO REMIND US OF OUR OWN NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES AS A CULTURE AND INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES AS INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE I THINK CARRIED COMBINES THOSE TWO BRILLIANTLY IN A WAY I DON'T REALLY SEE THERE'LL BE HUGE BENEFIT NEARLY DEMONISING THE OUTSIDE AND THEREFORE THE INEVITABLE PART OF THAT PARTICULAR AN ESPIONAGE STORIES YOU PROBABLY PUSH THAT INTO A FICTIONAL AREA THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IS IS TOO MUCH BUT
IN THE END THERE YOU ARE THERE TO SPEAK AS WE ALWAYS SAY THERE'S TRUTH TO POWER IDEA THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THERE TO DO AN ANT THAT'S BE HONEST I THINK THERE IS ENOUGH BRITISH HISTORY TO TO SORT OF BE A FUEL FOR THAT DEBATE WE'RE NOT TO BE TOO MUCH FOR MORAL ISSUE DO YOU DO YOUR OWN BACKGROUND IS IS IS VARIED ISN'T IT AND IN TERMS OF THE THINGS YOU DONE OR NOT ACTUALLY HUGELY TELEVISION BASED NOW ME I WAS AT A BENEFIT WHERE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN TERMS OF
IN THE THEATRE I'VE TAKEN ON BIG BIG BIG PIECES A LOT SHAKESPEARE SHAKESPEARE COMPANY END ADAPTED THE ODYSSEY FOR EXAMPLE HOMER'S ODYSSEY AND SO IT'S BIG BOOK THE NIGHT MANAGER AND STRUCTURALLY COMPLEX SO MAYBE JUST DIE I REALLY DID TO BE HONEST ENJOYED JUST ATTACKING THAT AND FINDING STRUCTURALLY CLEVER WAYS OF TELLING THE NARRATIVE SAFE SOMETIMES FLIPPING TIME
GIVING US A SUBPOENA SHOW YOU'RE MORE DARING IN THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF YOU JUST AND HELIUM YET COS BECAUSE IN THEATRE OF COURSE HE WAS IMAGINATIVE SPACE WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN CHANGE LOCATION TIME IN HER SECOND BUY SOMEONE NEARLY PUTTING ON DIFFERENT HAT THAT PUTS HIM AND AND AND I QUITE ENJOYED THE THAT SORT OF OPPORTUNITY AND THE CARRY ENCOURAGED IT VERY MUCH WHEN I MET HIM TO SALUTE TO BE BOLD STRUCTURALLY NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOW ENTIRELY WHAT THE PUT DOWN DAVID PARR SCREENWRITER OF THE NIGHT MANAGER WHOSE LAST EPISODE GOES OUT THIS WEEKEND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
IT'S FIVE TO NINE HERE IN DUBLIN THERE'LL BE MASSIVE CELEBRATIONS THERE WILL BE PARTIES ON THE STREET AND PARADES BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT OF COURSE THE EVENTS OF THE RISING ARE CAPTURED IN THE CULTURE OF THIS COUNTRY IN ITS POETRY AND ITS THEATRE IN ARTS MORE GENERALLY LET'S TALK TO TWO PEOPLE CAN REFLECT ON WHAT THAT TELLS US ABOUT THE MODERN COUNTRY AND ABOUT ITS PAST DOCTOR GILLIAN O'BRIEN IS HERE WITH ME ON THE STREET SHE'S FROM
AT LIVERPOOL'S JOHN MOORES UNIVERSITY AND THEO DAWG AND HE'S HERE AS WELL A POET AND A WRITER JULIAN WHAT PART OF WHAT MAKES THE HISTORY AND THE CULTURE SO INTERESTING IS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE FAMILY LINKS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD A ROLE IN THOSE EVENTS ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
THAT'S TRUE MY GREAT GRANDFATHER FOUGHT IN THE RISING IN WEXFORD BUT IN REALITY THEY REALLY NOT THAT MANY A COUPLE OF THOUSAND PEOPLE INVOLVED OBVIOUSLY NOW THERE ARE MANY OTHER RELATED TO THEM AND I THINK THAT'S SPREAD THROUGH THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING AN INTEREST IN THE RISING AN INTEREST IN HOW IT'S BEEN COMMEMORATED AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THROUGH NOT JUST THE HISTORY BUT ALSO IN A CULTURAL EVENTS THAT ARE OCCURRING BOTH
THROUGH THE LAST CENTURY AND ALSO TODAY AND THEO OF COURSE IT IS ALWAYS FORM THESE EVENTS AT THE BACKDROP TO SOME EXTRAORDINARY POETRY ONE THINKS OF YEATS'S FAMOUS LINE ABOUT THE TERRIBLE BEAUTY DOES IT STILL INSPIRE
WELL I THINK THE PROJECT OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE WILL ALWAYS WEAR ANY CITIZEN AND THE POETS OR A CITIZENS I THINK YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE RISING PRIMARILY AS A CULTURAL GESTURE AND NOBODY NOT EVEN THE MOST OPTIMISTIC OF THEIR MILITARY LEADERS EXPECTED MILITARY SUCCESS WHAT THEY HOPED TO DO WAS SPARKED THE IMAGINATION OF THE PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM REALISE THAT IT LIBERTY INDEPENDENCE WAS AFTER ALL POSSIBLE THEY HELD OUT A VISION OF INDEPENDENCE AND QUITE MIRACULOUSLY AGAINST ALL THE ODDS
AGAINST ALL THE MILITARY GUARDS THEY SUCCEEDED IT A STRIKING FOR ME AS AN OUTSIDER GILLIAN THAT IT IS WORDS THAT REALLY SURVIVE HERE IN OTHER WORDS THE WORDS OF THAT PROCLAMATION NOW OF COURSE YES THEY MAKE REFERENCE TO VIOLENCE BUT THERE SOME INSPIRING WORDS THAT ARE STILL USED IN SCHOOLS THAT ARE STILL IMPORTANT TO IRISH CITIZENS I THINK THE PROCLAMATION IS AN INCREDIBLE DOCUMENT AND IT'S WHEN THE CERTAINLY HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME EVEN IF THEY REPUBLIC THAT THEY HAD ENVISAGED NEVER APPEARED
BUT ALSO I THINK THERE ARE RISING IS BUILT ON A HUGE CULTURAL SWELLS THAT'S COME FROM REALLY THE END OF THERE WITH THE COLLAPSE OF THE IRISH PARLIAMENTARY PARTY IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND THE GROWTH OF AN INTEREST IN SPORT AND LITERATURE AND LANGUAGE AND DRAMA AND MUSIC YES THROUGH THE GAELIC LEAGUE I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT THE REPOSSESSION OF THE LANGUAGE THE REPOSSESSION OF A SENSE OF NATIONAL IDENTITY AND PRIDE IN A CULTURE WHICH HAD BEEN TREATED AS A BALD
TO SPEAK FROM THE HEART OF YOUR OWN CULTURE HE SPEAK FOR THE MOST ABSOLUTE FORM OF LIBERTY IMAGINABLE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE RISING WAS IT WAS A KIND OF A LIGHTNING CONDUCTOR FOR POWERS AND ENERGIES THAT HAD BEEN GATHERING IN THE CULTURAL LEVEL AND I'M TALKING ABOUT SO FRIDGES AND I'M TALKING ABOUT PACIFISM AS WELL AS MILITARY INSURRECTION IS ALL OF THOSE CURTAINS
WHAT A LIVELY AND POWERFUL IT TOOK SOME POINT DISCHARGE TO GET THAT FLASH OF LIGHTNING OUT OF IT WHAT MIGHT BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD WHAT MIGHT THIS HISTORIC OR REMEMBRANCE OF A HISTORIC EVENT ACTUALLY DO FOR ISLAND'S FUTURE WILL IT CHANGE ATTITUDES AMONGST THE YOUNG
I THINK IT'S BROUGHT AN AWARENESS THAT HADN'T REALLY BEEN EXISTED UNTIL VERY RECENTLY AND I THINK THAT ANYTHING ALLOWS US TO DISCUSS OUR PAST AND CONSIDER WHERE THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BE IS AN INTERESTING AND VALUABLE THING TO DO
YES I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING I WAS RIGHT THOSE WHO FORGET HISTORY ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT AT THAT THIS IS THE MOST THOROUGH GOING ACT OF REPOSSESSION I THINK THAT ANY MODERN STATE HAS UNDERGONE AN INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH ALL OF THE DRIVERS ARE COMING OUT OF THE ARCHIVES ALL KINDS OF OUR CODES ARE OPENING UP AND ITS PREY IS STUDIED INTERROGATION WHO IN OUR COMPLEX THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN I THINK THAT WE WOULD SHAPE AND IMAGINE A NEW FUTURE FOR OURSELVES AND YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE NOT CONCERN THAT IT CAN INSPIRE THE WRONG LESSONS
I THINK I'D BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE I THINK HER KNOWLEDGE OF OUR PAST ALLOWS US TO MOVE FORWARD TO A MORE INTERESTING AND MORE UNITED FUTURE I'D PROBABLY HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROJECT RIGHT NOW THAN I HAVE IN THE BRITISH PROJECT THERE'S A GREAT THANK GOD WE DO NOT BELIEVE
VERY SKILFULLY GOT A CONTROVERSIAL LAST WORD THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED HAD TO THEODORE ORGAN TO DOCTOR GILLIAN O'BRIEN THAT'S IT FOR ME IN DUBLIN
