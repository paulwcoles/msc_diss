LEAVE US CRITICISE THE CONTENT AND THE TIMING OF THE TREASURY WARNING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF BRICKS IT ON PENSIONS AND ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME IN THE LATEST OF OUR REPORTS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE U.K. ONLY E.U. REFERENDUM MICHELLE IS IN NORTHERN IRELAND WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW IN THE EVENT OF BRECHT'S IT BRITAIN'S ONLY LAND BORDER WITH EUROPE WILL OPERATE OFF THE REFERENDUM WAS THERE
IT WAS A GOING TO BE CHECKPOINTS AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE CUSTOMS THEY'RE CONSTANTLY I WAS EVEN A FIVER CAN WE HAVE STAR
IT'S GOING TO PUT PEOPLE OFF AND THE WINNER OF THE ORWELL PRIZE A CARDI OR STORE OFFSKI TALKS TO US ABOUT HIS BOOK AT THE INVENTION OF RUSSIA THAT NEWS IS READ BY KRYSTLE DAVID CAMERON HAS ANNOUNCED THE PLAN DEPLOYMENT OF A ROYAL NAVY WARSHIP OFF THE COAST OF LIBYA IT WOULD HELP THE LIBYAN COASTGUARD PREVENT MIGRANTS TAKING DANGEROUS JOURNEYS ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN AND COMBAT ARMS SMUGGLING TO THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP MY CAMERON MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT IN JAPAN FROM WHERE JAMES LANDALE REPORTS
LAST SUNDAY THE NEW LIBYAN GOVERNMENT ASKED THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR MORE HELP IN TRAINING IT'S NAVY AND COASTGUARD TO STOP THE TRAFFICKING OF MIGRANTS ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN
DAVID CAMERON HAS NOW PROMISED WORLD LEADERS AT THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT THAT HE WILL SEND A WARSHIP TO DO JUST THAT
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN THE EAVES EXPECTED IN COMING WEEKS TO EXTEND THE MANDATE OF ITS CURRENT NAVAL OPERATION WHICH HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO STOP THE TRAFFICKING
THE U.K. CURRENTLY HAS ONE SURVEY BESSEL H.M.S. ENTERPRISE OPERATING IN THE AREA
THE TREASURY HAS PRODUCED FIGURES FORECASTING THAT MILLIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE PENSIONERS WOULD BE WORSE OFF IF BRITAIN LEFT FOR EUROPEAN UNION WITH THE BASIC STATE PENSION WORTH AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POUNDS A YEAR LESS IN REAL TERMS BUT LEAVE HER RUBBISH THE PREDICTIONS THEY'VE ALSO ACCUSED MINISTERS OF BREACHING THE SPIRIT OF THEIR OWN SO CALLED PURDAH RULES BY PUBLISHING THE ANALYSIS LATE LAST NIGHT JUST TWO HOURS BEFORE ALL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS WERE REQUIRED TO STAY OUT OF THE DEBATE
THE FORMER FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLAND ALEX SALMOND HAS PREDICTED A VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD PROMPT A FRESH REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE WITHIN TWO YEARS SPEAKING OUT OF B. B. C. DEBATE IN GLASGOW LAST NIGHT MY SALMON SUGGESTED AN INDEPENDENCE VOTE WOULD TAKE PLACE IF THE U.K. AS A WHOLE OPTED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE E.U. BUT THE MAJORITY OF SCOTS WANTED TO REMAIN
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE WERE THE TWO YOU'VE FITTED OFF THE U.K. NEGOTIATING OR AT ALL IF YOU HAD THE SITUATION WHERE SCOTLAND AND FORTY WEEKS DAME VOTES REMAIN AND THE REST OF THE U.K. ON ENGLAND DRAG SCOTLAND BY VOTING TO LEAVE THAT WOULD JUSTIFY IN MY OPINION ANOTHER REFERENDUM BECAUSE DURING THE REFERENDUM IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE PEOPLE ARE SCOTT AND WERE TOLD THAT VOTING NOR WOULD SECURE SCOTLAND'S POSITION WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION
RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT SCOTLAND IS LAGGING BEHIND ENGLAND WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE FROM POORER BACKGROUNDS INTO UNIVERSITY DESPITE THE ABOLITION OF TUITION FEES BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT A REPORT BY THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH AND THE SUTTON TRUST SAYS THE CAP ON THE NUMBER OF UNIVERSITY PLACES IN SCOTLAND MEANS STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS ARE LESS LIKELY TO ATTEND THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S INCREASING SUPPORT THROUGH GRANTS AND LOANS FOR MAINTENANCE COSTS

MISTER MACGREGOR SAID IT WAS A MATTER OF REAL CONCERN THE HOME OFFICE SAID POLICE HAD PROVIDED ASSURANCES THE ISSUE WILL BE KEPT UNDER CLOSE REVIEW
M.P.S ARE WARNING THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES IT'S CLOSE TO BREAKING POINT THE COMMONS PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS VICTIMS AND WITNESSES ARE BEING LET DOWN AND CUT BACKS ARE THREATENING THE ABILITY OF THE COURTS TO DELIVER JUSTICE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE REPORT SHOWS THE URGENT NEED FOR THE REFORMS AND TWO BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF INVESTMENT IT'S MAKING

THIS MORNING THE POLICE AND COASTGUARD HAVE RESUMED THEIR SEARCH FOR TWO MISSING TOURISTS ONE OF THEM BRITISH AT THE SPOT WHERE THE SPEEDBOAT FLIPPED OVER ON ITS WAY BACK FROM A DAY TRIP TO A MARINE NATIONAL PARK
SEVEN PEOPLE REMAIN IN HOSPITAL WITH SERIOUS INJURIES AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE BODIES OF TWO WOMEN ONE BRITISH THE OTHER GERMAN WHO DIED AFTER BEING TRAPPED UNDER THE CAPSIZED BOAT

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIX MINUTES PAST SIX LET US TURN TO THE WEATHER AND PHILIP AVERY IS ACTOR AT THE B.B.C. WEATHER CENTRE THIS MORNING LOOK AT PHILIP DOESN'T VERY GOOD MORNING THE DAY'S FORECAST WITH WALES THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND ITS YES LET'S THROW IN SOUTH EAST ENGLAND AS WELL I'M ONLY HESITANT ABOUT SOUTH EASTERN ENGLAND BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME SHOWERS HERE PARTICULARLY ALONG THE CHANNEL COAST JUST AT THE MOMENT IT'S GRADUALLY DRIFTING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INLAND PERHAPS FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE MORNING BUT CERTAINLY BY LATE MORNING ON INTO THE AFTERNOON THOSE SHOWERS WILL HAVE DIED AWAY
WHICH THEN LEAVES US WITH A FOCUS OF SHOWERS SOME OF THESE REALLY QUITE HEAVY AND THUNDERY ACROSS WALES AND THE SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND BUT IN ALL THREE AREAS THERE IS A PRETTY DECENT CHANCE OF SEEING A WEE BIT OF HAZY SUNSHINE AS WELL A FRACTION WARMER THAN YESTERDAY PERHAPS AT ITS WARMEST SUMMER IN THE LONDON AREA POSSIBLY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE DEGREES TODAY ELSEWHERE CERTAINLY WELL ON INTO THE TEENS
TO THE REST OF ENGLAND WALLAH ARE DRY AND I START HERE WATCH OUT FOR FOG FIRST UP THAT WOULD BE A WAY IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE HOURS AND THEN WHILE DISAPPOINTING AMOUNTS OF CLOUD STILL IN THE FAR NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND AND LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON WE MAY SEE SOME LOW CLOUD DRIFTING IN OFF THE NORTH SEA TO AFFECT THE EAST ANGLIA COAST AS WELL BUT OTHERWISE IT'S A PLEASANT ENOUGH DAY WITH SOME HAZY SUNSHINE AND AGAIN THE TEMPERATURES WELL ON INTO THE TEENS
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND HERE CLOUDY START MAYBE ENOUGH ABOUT THAT CLOUD IN WESTERN PARTS FOR THAT TO BE THE ODD SPOT OF LIGHT RAIN THAT SHOULD SOON QUIT THE SCENE AND THEN IT'S ESSENTIALLY A DRY AND A BRIGHTENING STORY HERE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND COME THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE SUNSHINE POURING THROUGH SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN COULD WELL BE YOURS AND FINALLY TO SCOTLAND
THE WEATHER FRONT THE PLAGUE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PARTS YESTERDAY WERE THE REMNANTS OF IT STILL GOT ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO BE PRODUCING THE ODD SPOT OF LIGHT RAIN AND DRIZZLE PERHAPS WE'VE GOT A BRIGHTNESS COMING IN AROUND ABOUT THE SOLWAY BEST OF THE SUNSHINE IN THE FAR NORTH AGAIN AND ARE HIGH ON THE DAY OF EIGHTEEN IN THE SUN
THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND THIS IN A RATHER RESTING HEADLINE ON THE FRONT THE TELEGRAPH IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO GO TO FRANCE AT LEAST A FAMILY'S BEEN ADVISED TO CANCEL HALF TERM HOLIDAYS TO FRANCE BECAUSE OF THE STRIKES CRIPPLING THIS COUNTRY THE WARNING COMES FROM THE R.A.C. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MOTORING SERVICES COMPANY
WHO SAYS THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T INVESTED MUCH MONEY AND GOING TO FRANCE FRANCE PERHAPS YOU'D BE BETTER OFF ENJOYING THE STAYCATION I'M NOT GETTING INVOLVED AND POINTS OUT THAT ANYBODY IF YOU'RE INTENT ON TRAVELLING YOU SHOULD STOCK UP WITH A FULL TANK OF FUEL BEFORE LEAVING BRITAIN AND BECAUSE LAST NIGHT AROUND HALF THE COUNTRY'S TEN THOUSAND PETROL STATIONS EITHER PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY RUN OUT OF FUEL
THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS AN INTERESTING LEAD STORY AT ALL THE F. T. SAYS BROACHED TIME WORN A BIT AS GROWTH HUNT TURNS TO CONTENT TO TOP APPLE EXECUTIVE RAISED THE PROSPECT OF T. SAYS OF THE IPHONE MAKER BUYING THE TIME WARNER ARE MEETING WITH THE MEDIA GROUPS STRATEGY CHIEF THIS IS ACCORDING TO THREE PEOPLE BRIEFED ON THEIR ENCOUNTER EDDIE CUE OVERSEAS APPLES BUSINESSES SUCH AS I TUNES THE STALL THE APPLE MUSIC HIGH CLOUD AS WELL BROACHED THE IDEA OF A BED AT A MEETING AT THE END OF LAST YEAR
SAYS THE F. T. IT WAS A MEETING WITH THE HEAD OF CORPORATE STRATEGY AT TIME WARNER NOWHERE AN H.B.O. C.N.N. ET-CETERA AND THEY DIDN'T GET BEYOND A PRELIMINARY STAGE THESE TALKS AND THEY NEVER INCLUDED TIM COOK APPLES CHIEF EXECUTIVE BUT NONETHELESS THE FACT THAT APPLE CONSIDERED BIDDING FOR ONE OF THOSE PROMINENT MEDIA COMPANIES UNDERLINES THE F. T. SAYS THE TECH GROUPS GROWING DESIRE TO OFFER ITS OWN CONTENT
THERE ARE NO SURPRISE E.U. REFERENDUM STORIES ALL OVER THE FRONT PAGES THEY FOCUS REALLY ON THE MIGRATION NUMBERS FROM YESTERDAY BUT THE TIMES HAS THE HEADLINE Y. YOU ARMY PLANS KEPT SECRET FROM VOTERS IN THE SUGGESTION THAT THERE A STEP TOWARDS CREATING A EUROPEAN ARMY WITH THERE BEING KEPT SECRET UNTIL THE DAY AFTER NEXT MONTH'S REFERENDUM
THE PAPERS JUST THE PLANS HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP BY THE EARS FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF AND THEY FORESEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW EUROPEAN MILITARY AND OPERATIONAL STRUCTURES INCLUDING A HEADQUARTERS ARE SUPPORTED BY GERMANY AND OTHER COUNTRIES AS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS AN E. YOU ARMY THEY WERE SIMILAR IDEAS THAT WERE RETAILED BY BRITAIN BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN BUT THE PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE WORRIES THAT A LOOPHOLE COULD ALLOW NINE STATES TO GROUP TOGETHER AND SO BY POT ANY RETAILER
IT IS TEN PAST SIX AND THERE ARE NO UNIVERSITY TUITION FEES IN SCOTLAND FOR SCOTTISH STUDENTS BUT THEY'RE ALSO FEWER CHILDREN FROM POORER BACKGROUNDS GETTING INTO UNIVERSITY THIS ACCORDING TO THE SUTTON TRUST THE EDUCATION CHARITY IN EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY WELL BRANDON JEFFERIES THAT EDUCATION EDITOR AN INTERESTING BROWN WHEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST ISN'T IT BUT PROPER EVIDENCE NOW THAT IT'S TRUE
THAT'S RIGHT THEY'VE TAKEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA AND LOOKED UP WHAT'S HAPPENED IN SCOTLAND AND HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO THE REST OF THE U.K. SINCE THE LAST VESTIGES OF PEOPLE PAYING BACK SOME OF THE COST OF THEIR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION WAS WAS ABOLISHED IN SCOTLAND AND IT'S NOT THAT THE NUMBERS OF
A PEEP FROM POORER BACKGROUNDS IN SCOTLAND GOING INTO UNIVERSITY HASN'T GONE UP AT ALL THEY HAVE BUT THEY HAVEN'T GONE UP AS MUCH AS IN ENGLAND WHERE FEES OF COURSE INCREASED TO NINE THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR WHICH STUDENTS THEN PAYING
AND IF YOU LOOK AT SCOTLAND WHAT'S REALLY STRIKING THEY POINT OUT IS THAT IT'S MIDDLE CLASS SCOTTISH STUDENTS THAT LEAVE UNIVERSITY WITH THE LISTS DEBT OF ANY GROUP IN THE U.K.
BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE BEEN OFFSET BY A HUGE AMOUNT OF PROGRESS IN GETTING POORER PEOPLE PEEP FROM WORKING CLASS ORDINARY FAMILIES INTO UNIVERSITY TO BENEFIT FROM THAT TO THIS ADDRESS WHY THAT MIGHT BE
WERE PART OF IT IS IN SCOTLAND OF COURSE THERE WAS A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF PLACES NOW THE NUMBER OF PLACES HAS BEEN INCREASED OVERALL VERY SLIGHTLY SOME PLACES WERE SET ASIDE FOR HER STUDENTS FROM POOR BACKGROUNDS AT ELITE UNIVERSITIES VERY TOP UNIVERSITIES IN SCOTLAND AND THAT HAS HELPED
A LITTLE BIT BUT BASICALLY IF YOU'VE GOT A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF PLACES IT'S THE MIDDLE CLASSES THAT HAVE GOT VERY SHARP ELBOWS ARE BETTER AND GETTING THEIR CHILDREN INTO THOSE UNIVERSITY AND MY COMPETITION DOES THE LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF PLACES
ARISE FROM THE INABILITY OF THE UNIVERSITIES TO CHARGE TUITION FEES BECAUSE THE TUITION FEES THERE ARE FEES PAID BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT THEY'RE NOT IT IS THE CASE BEING MADE THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO EXPAND AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD BECAUSE OF THIS POLICY
THAT'S RIGHT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE THE CASE THAT IN ENGLAND WHERE THERE HAS BEEN EXPANSION DRIVEN PARTLY BY THE FACT THAT TUITION FEES YOU BECOME A MAJOR PART THE MAJOR PART OF THE UNIVERSITY'S INCOME THAT THAT'S ALLOWED MORE PEOPLE THROUGH THE DOOR AND WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE GET IN AND MORE PEOPLE FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS HAVE BEEN GETTING IN
IN SCOTLAND THE DOOR IS HELD MUCH MORE TIGHTLY BECAUSE IT'S THE GOVERNMENT THAT HAS TO PAY FOR EVERY SINGLE UNIVERSITY PLACE THE MONEY ISN'T COMING FROM JEWISH INCY FEES SO AT THE VERY LEAST THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT HAVING NO TUITION FEES HAS HELPED THE POORER SECTIONS OF SOCIETY IN SCOTLAND BUT INTERESTING BRAMAH GEOFFREY'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL BE TALKING TO JOHN SWINNEY THE SCOTTISH EDUCATION MINISTER APT OUR TENT
IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX BARACK OBAMA WILL BE THE FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT HIROSHIMA LATER THIS MORNING JOHN SOUTHWORTH OUR CORRESPONDENT IS THERE
JOHN HAS THERE BEEN ANY BRIEFING ON WHAT HE'S EXPECTED TO SAY
VERY LITTLE SARAH WE KNOW THAT HE'S GOING TO COME HERE TO THE PIECE
VERY CLOSE TO THE THE ACTUAL SPOT WHERE THAT ATOM BOMB EXPLODED
ON THE SIXTH OF AUGUST NINETEEN FORTY FIVE BUT WE GET A FEELING I THINK THAT'S IN SUCH OF THE SENSITIVITY SURROUNDING
THIS VISIT SUCH OTHER THEIR POLITICAL COMPLEXITIES AND CALCULATIONS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE THAT THERE WILL BE OBVIOUS CRITICISM BACK HOME FROM CONSERVATIVE AND VETERANS GROUPS THAT THEY'RE STILL KIND OF CALIBRATING WHAT WE WHAT WE DO EXPECT IS A VERY SHORT CEREMONY
A SHORT SPEECH OF JUST A FEW MINUTES NO KEYNOTE ADDRESS IS NO BIG POLICY STATEMENTS BUT REALLY A VISIT DESIGNED AS AS A GESTURE OF RESPECT AND REMEMBRANCE AND THEY HAVE HAVE SAID ALREADY ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS AHEAD OF THIS VISIT THERE WILL BE NO APOLOGY
BUT I SUPPOSE WHAT THERE CANBY IS WHETHER IT'S THE BODY LANGUAGE OF THE OTHER REFLECTIONS THAT GO SOME WAY TO ACKNOWLEDGING WHAT
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT THAT IS SOMETHING RECOGNISED AND WELCOME HERE IN THE CITY CERTAINLY FROM THE SURVIVORS WE'VE SPOKEN TO
IT THE SYMBOLISM IT IS HARD TO IGNORE IT WAS OF COURSE A U.S. PRESIDENT WHO GAVE THAT ORDER FOR THE DROPPING OF AN ATOMIC BOMB ON THIS CITY THE FIRST TIME
EVER TO HAVE USED SUCH A WEAPON AND TO DATE BECAUSE OF THE OBVIOUS SENSITIVITIES ON BOTH SIDES NO CURRENT HOLDER OF THE OFFICE HAS EVER VISITED
I THINK PEOPLE HERE THEMSELVES ACTUALLY SAVE AN APOLOGY THE NEED FOR AN APOLOGY IS BESIDE THE POINT THEY SIMPLY SAY IT'S A GOOD THING THAT THE LEADER
OF A COUNTRY WHICH STILL HAS OF COURSE ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST NUCLEAR ARSENALS WILL WHILE STILL IN OFFICE COME TO SEE FOR HIMSELF
THE AWESOME DESTRUCTIVE POWER
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT WAS BY TODAY'S STANDARDS A VERY CRUDE AND RUDIMENTARY DEVICE THAT AND ALSO WORTH MENTIONING MENTIONING SARAH THAT IT'S NOT LOST ON PEOPLE HERE THAT STANDING AT A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA AS HE IS AT ALL TIMES OF COURSE WILL BE VERY CLOSE AT HAND AND OFFICIAL CARRYING THAT BRIEFCASE WHICH CONTAINS THE LAUNCH COULD LET THE LAUNCH CODES FOR FOR A NUCLEAR STRIKE
JOHN SOUTHWORTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST SIX AND THE GOVERNMENT SAYS PLANS TO CHANGE THE BRITISH STILL PENSION SCHEME WON'T AFFECT OTHER PENSIONS SOME PEOPLE AREN'T SO SURE AND WITH MORE ON THAT ROB YEUNG IS HERE HI MORNING THE FATE OF TWO BIG BRITISH EMPLOYERS REMAINS UNCLEAR THIS MORNING ON MONDAY THERE WERE HOPES WE WOULD KNOW BY NOW WHETHER B.H.S. AND TART SILVER YOU KAY WOULD BE SAVED AND WHO THEIR NEW OWNERS WOULD BE BUT IT'S STILL A VERY UNCERTAIN TIME FOR THE COMPANY'S TWENTY TWO THOUSAND WORKERS
ONE ISSUE THAT LINKS BOTH BUSINESSES IS THEIR PENSION SCHEMES AND THE FINANCIAL BLACK HOLES THEY CONTAIN THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO CHANGE PENSIONS LAW IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESCUE TART UP AT B.H.S. THERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY INTO WHY THE PENSION SCHEME THAT WASN'T FIXED WHEN THE RETAILER WAS SOLD LAST YEAR WHEN OUR MARKETS GUESS THIS MORNING IS ROSS MOULD THE INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT J. BELL MORNING MORNING ROB
ON B.H.S. WHERE ARE WE ON THE POTENTIAL SALE OF THE RETAILER WAS STILL TRYING TO FIND OUT WHETHER THERE IS ACTUALLY A BIDDER FOR THE BUSINESS IT SEEMS AS IF GREG TUFNELL HAS ACTUALLY PUT SOME MONEY DOWN ON THE TABLE OR IS IT LEAST OFFERING NOT A BID FOR THE WHOLE COMPLETE LOCK STOCK WHICH IS CLEARLY POTENTIALLY THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OPTION OF THE ADMINISTRATORS OF THE BIDS MIKE ASHLEY OF SPORTS DIRECT JOHN HAGRID HAVE MATALAN
THEY SEEM TO HAVE GONE QUIET BUT MUM THERE'S NO DEFINITIVE NEWS EITHER WAY WHICH UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE STAFF IS CLEARLY VERY WORRYING IS LIQUIDATION OF B.H.S. THEN STILL A REALISTIC PROSPECT IT'S IT'S A RISK I SUSPECT THE MOST LIKELY OPTION IS THAT THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A PIECEMEAL PERCH THEY'LL BE THAT'S A COMEDY WILL BE BROKEN UP AND SOLD OFF PIECEMEAL SOME OF THE STORE SITES ARE POTENTIALLY ATTRACTIVE
BUT SIMILAR PROPERTY AGENCIES HAVE LOOKED AT IT SO THAT SOME OF THEM REALLY HAVE A VERY UNATTRACTIVE LEASES IN LESS INTERESTING PARTS OF THE HIGH STREET ON TATA WE WERE EXPECTING AT THE VERY LEAST A SHORTLIST OF BIDDERS ON WEDNESDAY THAT HAS NOT MATERIALISED SO WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON THEN I THINK HERE THE BOARD ANY POTENTIAL BIDDERS ARE PROBABLY WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S CONSULTATION ON HOW THEIR PENSION LIABILITIES ARE CALCULATED GOES WHICH IS A MONTH LONG COMET WHERE IT'S A VERY LONG CONSULTATION AGAIN HOW HOW THE LIABILITIES ARE CALCULATED WHAT THE BASE FOR THOSE I THINK THAT IS CLEARLY
POTENTIAL KEY SWEETENER FOR THE DEAL I SUSPECT THAN ANY BUYERS WAITING TO SEE WHAT POTENTIAL ABILITIES WILL BE TAKING ON O.K. STAY WITH US FOR THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING AT CHANGING PENSION LAW TO MAKE THE OLD BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME LESS OF A HINDRANCE TO POTENTIAL BUYERS OF TARTAR STEELED K. THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAINT JA JAVID SAYS THAT OTHER PENSION SCHEMES WON'T BE AFFECTED SOME PENSIONS ADVISERS ARE LESS SURE THOUGH UNION SAY THEY'LL SEEK CAST IRON SAFEGUARDS
THAT ANY CHANGES DON'T LEAD TO LOTS OF EMPLOYERS DODGING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE UNION SEVERAL WITH US ARE ALAN JOHNSTON THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR THE BRITISH STEEL PENSION TRUST AND JOANNE SEE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE PENSIONS AND LIFE TITHE SAVINGS ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS PENSION PROFESSIONALS GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING ALAN FIRST OF ALL FOR YOU THE DEFICIT HAS INCREASED TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IS THAT RIGHT WHY HAS THAT HAPPENED
IT DID DO IS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF TIMING THE PROPER DEFICIT IS FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE AT THE LAST FORMAL VALUATION WE DID AN UPDATE IN DECEMBER WHEN THINGS HAD MOVED AGAINST US IN TERMS OF OUR OF OUR LIABILITIES
AS IT HAPPENS HAVE THE ASSETS IN DECEMBER WORTH THIRTEEN POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS THE ASSETS LAST NIGHT WERE THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION POUNDS THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MOVE AROUND ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS RIGHT SO WHAT WERE THESE PROPOSED CHANGES WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING ABOUT MEAN FOR THE MEMBERS OF YOUR SCHEME
IT COULD MEAN OF THAT THE CURRENT PENSIONERS HAVE FUTURE INCREASES WOULD NOT TO BE BASED ON A P.I. BUT WE WOULD BE BASED ON C.P.I. HAND THIS WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE LIABILITIES BY SOME TWO TO TWO AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS WHICH WOULD TAKE THE SCHEME FROM
A DEFICIT INTO SIGNIFICANCE A PLUS SO IT IS A LESS GENEROUS SCHEME MEANING THAT THE PAST PROMISES WHICH WERE MADE ARE ESSENTIALLY BEING BROKEN BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT WHAT COMPARING IT WITH THIS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DIDN'T TO DO THIS AND IF WE COULDN'T DO THIS WE WERE WE WERE DID EVITA HOPEFULLY FINISH UP IN THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED THIS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER FOR SIXTY THOUSAND UP MY HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS I.E. PEOPLE UNDER SIXTY FIVE ACTIVE MEMBERS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD THEIR PENSION
APPEARED YET AND IT'S AT LEAST AS GOOD FOR THE PENSIONERS WHO ARE DON'T FORGET IF WE DO GO INTO THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND C.P.A. WILL BE THE BASIS FOR A FUTURE INCREASES ANYWAY BUT THOUSANDS OF YOUR MEMBERS WILL FACE SIGNIFICANT CUTS TO THEIR INCOME SIX THOUSAND MEMBERS ACCORDING TO THIS GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT
THAT IS THAT IS THAT THAT IS A FOOT A FLAW IN THE WAY THAT THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND PAYS OAT PROTECTION WE HAVE SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO DECIDED TO TAKE WHAT'S KNOWN AS A HIGH LOW PENSION I GET A HIGHER PENSION UP TO THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE AND IN RETURN FOR A LOWER PENSION AFTER THE STATE PENSION KICKS IN
THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND DOESN'T HAVE ANY RULES THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO REDUCE THEIR PENSION COULD PEOPLE GET TO SIXTY FIVE SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE A HIGH BIT OF PENSION MEAN TAMED MINUS MINUS TEN PERCENT WHICH IS THE MINIMUM REDUCTION IN THE PEE PEE
DOESN'T THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE PROMISES OF THE FIND BENEFIT OR FINAL SALARY PENSION SCHEMES IN THIS CASE A WORTHLESS NO IT DOESN'T SAY THAT THEY'RE WORTHLESS WHAT IT'S SAYING IS
IN PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO THAT TO TATA WE NEED TO FIND A RESOLUTION TO THE TARTS STILL CASE AND THAT'S QUITE CLEAR WE NEED TO DO THAT IN ORDER THAT THE COMPANY CAN BE SOLD AS YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
AND SO THE TRUSTEES ALONG WITH THE COMPANY HAVE GONE WITH THIS VERY SPECIFIC PROPOSAL TO GOVERNMENT AND IT'S RIGHT THAT WE DO FIND A RESOLUTION TO THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT THIS VERY SPECIFIC CASE AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THIS THESE CHANGES WOULD ONLY APPLIED TO THE BRITISH STILL PENSION SCHEME
DON'T HAVE WIDE RAMIFICATIONS BECAUSE THESE CHANGES THAT I'LL BE MADE VERY QUICKLY FOR WEEKS HE'S A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IN ORDER IN FACT TO MAKE CHANGES THAT AFFECT THEIR LONG TERM SECURITY OF PENSIONS AND PENSIONS MORE GENERALLY WANT TO SO THERE'S A MUCH WIDER SET OF ISSUES THAT WE WOULD NEED TO NEED TO LOOK AT IN RELATION TO DEFY MEN IF IT PENSION SCHEMES BECAUSE SAID THEY ARE UNDER PRESSURE FROM ALL SORTS OF DIRECTIONS FOR ME AT THE CURRENT INVESTMENT MARKETS FROM LONGEVITY
AND SO WE NEED A LONGER LOOK TO SEE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT IF I'M ANYTHING PENSION SCHEMES THEY AREN'T CHANGE THERE CAN BE MADE IN FOUR WEEKS LOTS OF COMPANIES WILL SAY THAT THEY HAVE PENSION DEFICITS WHICH THEY DON'T LIKE LOTS OF PENSION SCHEME CAN SAY THEY ARE HAVING A TOUGH TIME SO WHAT IS TO STOP OTHER COMPANIES SAYING TO THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY WE'D LIKE QUITE A BIT OF THIS TART A TREATMENT AS WELL WITH THE GOVERNMENT NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR OF THE CONSULTATION DOCUMENT ISN'T YET CLEAR ON THE SPECIFIC WAY IN WHICH
BUT SHE'S YOUR PENSION SCHEME WILL BE RING FENCED AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GOVERNMENT WILL NEED TO TO WORK ON BUT
AS ALAN SAID THERE ARE SPECIFIC RULES IN THERE IN THE BUSH SO PENSION SCHEME TO PREVENT IT FROM MAKING CHANGES THERE ARE RULES ALREADY BUT TO ALLOW CHANGES TO BE MADE THIS WILL THIS WILL JUST MAKE PEOPLE EVEN MORE MISTRUSTFUL OF THE PENSIONS INDUSTRY
I THINK PEOPLE DO NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE RECEIVING DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEMES IN THIS COUNTRY SIXTY MILLION PEOPLE STILL SAVING INTO THOSE PENSIONS THE REGULATIONS AND THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE PUT AROUND THOSE SCHEMES ARE IN PLACE HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME AND A VERY STRONG O.K. ALAN JOHNSTON AND SEAGO'S THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH WILL LIKE ROSS MOULD FROM A.J. BELL STILL WITH US
THIS MORNING THERE'S A STORY AROUND TODAY FROM THE TREASURY SAYING YES THAT MILLIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE PENSIONERS WILL BE WORSE OFF IF THE U.K. LEAVES THE EUROPEAN UNION VOTE LEAVE SAYS THE ANALYSIS IS UTTERLY OUTRAGEOUS WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT I THINK ON THE REMAINING CASE THEY THEIR ARGUMENT ARGUMENTS CLEARLY BASED ON THE RISK OF FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY EFFECTING ASSET PRICES THEY ARGUE THAT STERLING WERE POTENTIALLY GO DOWN THAT WOODSTOCK INFLATION AND THEREFORE IN REAL TERMS YOUR PENSION IS POTENTIALLY WERE WORTH LESS IN THE FUTURE
IF YOU'RE ON THE ON THE LEAF SIDE YOU'LL SAY WELL THAT'S A PRETTY ACCURATE SCENARIO ANALYSIS GOING ON IS I'D BE INTRIGUED TO KNOW WHAT THEY THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AREN'T JUST HOW GOOD THEIR TREASURIES CRYSTAL BALL REALLY HE'S ALTERED THE CASEY CITED REFER TO NINETEEN NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND ATE WITH THE RECESSIONS THERE AND THERE WAS A SHORT TERM HIT TO ACID VALUATIONS BUNCH JOANNE WE SAID THIS IS A LONG TERM ISSUE NOT A SHOT AND IT DOESN'T MENTION NINETEEN NINETY TWO SO AGAIN THAT IF YOU IF YOU RELIEVE COMPANY WON A MINUTE IT'S A RECESSION HAVE BEEN NINETY TWO WINSTON FELL OUT OF THE AIR
ACTUALLY QUITE A LOT ARE GOOD FOR THE FOR THE FOOT YOUR HUNDRED BECAUSE A LOT OF EARNINGS COME FROM OVERSEAS AND THE MARKET SHE RECOVERED VERY QUICKLY AFTERWARDS THERE'LL BE REMAIN AS WELL THINK AGAIN IT'S REAFFIRMING THE RISKS THAT ARE INVOLVED LEAVE US WILL PROBABLY STAY ON CONVINCED I THINK OH KAY THANK YOU ASKED FOR SMELL THERE FROM THERE A.J. BELL THIS IS THE TIME OF THE WEEK WHEN WE HAVE A CHAT WITH HER COMPANY BOSS THIS MORNING TALKING TO A MAN WHO RUNS A BUSINESS SELLING
WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL RATHER POSH READY MEALS CHARLIE AND WAS FED UP WITH HIS LIFE IN LONDON WENT OFF TRAVELLING WHEN HE CAME BACK TO BRITAIN SO HOW BUSY ALL OF HIS FRIENDS WERE AND CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF HAND MADE CRAFT READY MEALS AND CHARLIE BECOME THE BOSS OF AN APOLLO AS COMPANY HE'S WITH US GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SO TELL US IN YOUR OWN WORDS THEN HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE IDEA FOR YOUR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS IF YOU WERE A CHEF OR A COOK BEFORE

AND GROW THEM AND TURN THEM INTO SOMETHING WHICH I COULD SELL FOR QUITE A LOT MORE MONEY RIGHT BUT BUT THE OTHER THE OTHER DRIVER TO STARTING TO STARTING MY MY BUSINESS WAS AS A FRUSTRATED CONSUMER IS I LOVE YOU I LOVE COOKING
I'VE BEEN COOKING SINCE I WAS PROBABLY ABOUT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN AND THERE WASN'T SOMETHING ON THE MARKET FOR ME WHICH WAS DELICIOUS FOOD THAT COULD BE REPAIRED QUICKLY LOTS OF BUSINESS PEOPLE TOIL FOR MANY YEARS DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET THEIR PRODUCTS INTO STORES STRUGGLING LOSING LOTS OF MONEY YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A PRODUCT WHEN YOU RANG UP WAITROSE TRIES TO OFFER YOURS

IT'S EMERGED THAT ERRORS WHICH LED TO THE FINGERPRINTS AND D.N.A. RECORDS OF HUNDREDS OF TERROR SUSPECTS BEING DELETED WERE MORE WIDESPREAD THAN FIRST THOUGHT AND UPDATED REPORT SAYS EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN PROFILES WERE WRONGLY REMOVED FROM THE POLICE DATABASE IN ENGLAND AND WALES PREVIOUS REPORTS PUT THE FIGURE AT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THE HOME OFFICE SAID STEPS WERE BEING TAKEN TO FIX THIS

THANK YOU TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE PENSIONS MINISTER IS TELLING OLDER PEOPLE TODAY THEY WILL BE WORSE OFF IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS ARE LIVID BOTH AT THE SUGGESTION AND ALSO THE FACT THAT IT WAS ALL DONE JUST BEFORE THE OFFICIAL PURDAH PERIOD STARTS WITH NO SUCH PRONOUNCEMENTS ALLOWED TO BE MADE TOM BATEMAN UP POLITICAL REPORTERS IS ON THE LINE EXPLAINED THE PEARL ARGUMENT THAT'S FIRST
O.K. WILL PER DAY IS SOMETHING WE GET FOR ALL GENERAL ELECTIONS IN IT IS USUALLY A TWENTY EIGHT DAY PERIOD IN WHICH GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS THE CIVIL SERVICE THE ENTIRE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT IS EFFECTIVELY BANNED FROM MAKING ANY NEW ANNOUNCEMENTS OR PUBLICATIONS THAT COULD BE SEEN TO INFLUENCE THE VOTE SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT
REALLY PREVENT CIVIL SERVANTS FROM CONTINUING ANY WORK MAKING ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT COULD BE SEEN TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE WAY OVER TO BE HONEST WITH YOU USUALLY SUNG THEIR CROPS UP A LOT IN LOCAL ELECTIONS AND HIS SORT OF RIDICULOUS LISA OVER INTERPRETED BY VERY CAUTIOUS
PRESS OFFICERS WHOSE HAVE ALMOST REFUSED TO PICK UP THE PHONE DURING AN ELECTION A LOCAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAS BECOME AN ISSUE HERE BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT LAST NIGHT BECAUSE THE REFERENDUM PURRED APPEARED KICKED IN AT MIDNIGHT TWO HOURS BEFORE THAT WE HAD THE RELEASE OF THIS TREASURY DOCUMENT AS YOU MENTION ABOUT PENSIONS
AND THE PENSIONS MINISTER IS COMING ON THIS PROGRAMME TEN PAST EIGHT AND HE'S ON THE TIMES AND THAT THAT'S WHAT UPSETS THEM THERE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IS THAT FEELS DOESN'T IT FRANK LIKE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT PROCESS THE SUBS WELL IT IS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND VOTE LEAVE ART FURIOUS ABOUT THIS ONE LEAPT SPOKE PEOPLE SAY TO ME LAST NIGHT THIS IS JUST A COMPLETELY CYNICAL ATTEMPT BY THE GUM TOGETHER SQUEEZE ANOTHER DAY OUT OF THE CIVIL SERVICE
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT THIS PLAYS IN TWO IS THERE A SENSE THAT THERE HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT THIS AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE FOR THE REMAINED SITE BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT YOU'RE GOING TO REMEMBER THAT BIG ROW ABOUT THE LEAFLET WE ALL GOT LANDING ON OUR DOORMATS THE COST NINE BILLION POUNDS OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY THAT WAS SENT OUT JUST BEFORE THE SPENDING CAP REGIME CAME IN FOR THE TWO SITES IN THE CAMPAIGN SO AGAIN THEY SAID WELL LOOK THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT MACHINE BEING ABLE TO USE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE TO INFLUENCE
THE VOTE I THINK FRANKLY THIS WAS ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN THIS IS A BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT
THE GOVERNMENT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO USE IT HAD A STATED POSITION IT WAS ALWAYS I THINK GOING TO USE ITS POSITION TO DO THAT I MEAN FRANKLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PURDAH ISSUE THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION I WAS LOOKING BACK AT THE GUIDANCE AND THEY THEY DID A REVIEW OF THE MEMORABLE A.V. REFERENDUM VOTE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND THEY SAID THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD BEEN A COUPLE OF BREACHES OF THE PURDAH GUIDELINES THEM BUT THEY SAID WE CAN'T EVEN WORK OUT WHAT THE SANCTIONS ARE IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR FROM THE POLITICAL PARTIES ACT
WHAT SANCTIONS WOULD BE ME ACTUALLY ASK THE GOVERNOR AT THE TIME TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT NO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT I'D EVER TOOK PLACE SO I MEAN THE TREASURY SAYS NO RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN AND CLEARLY NO RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN THE COMPLAINT IS THAT IT'S GONE RIGHT UP TO THE WIRE I THINK THERE WILL BE A ROW ABOUT THIS I WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF TODAY BUT LEAVE WILL CONTINUE TO SAY THAT THEY'RE BEING TREATED LIKE THE UNDERDOGS AND IT IS UNFAIR I THINK THE GOVERNMENT
CARRY ON REGARDLESS AND ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PENSIONS WHAT THE CLAIMANT PENSIONS WE WILL BE DISCUSSING WITH IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WITH LADY'LL PENSIONS MINISTER LATER ON AS WELL TOM BATEMAN THANKS IT'S NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN THE COMMITTEE OF M. PIECES THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS CLOSE TO BREAKING POINT CLIVE COMMONERS A LEGAL CORRESPONDENT AND THAT IS QUITE A CLAIM AND WHAT WAY IS IT CLOSE TO BREAKING POINT
LOTS OF WAYS ACTUALLY GO THIS REPORT IS ENTITLED EFFICIENCY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND IT DOESN'T FIND THAT MUCH OF IT IT SAYS THAT THE SYSTEM IS BEDEVILLED BY LONGSTANDING POOR PERFORMANCE INCLUDING DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES COSTS OF BEING SHUNTED FROM ONE PART OF THE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER SO SOME WORRYING STATISTICS AROUND TWO THIRDS OF CROWN COURT TRIALS ARE DELAYED OR SIMPLY DON'T GO AHEAD AT ALL THERE'S A HUGE BACKLOG OF CASES
VICTIMS AND WITNESSES ARE HAVING TO WAIT LONGER FOR THEIR DAY IN COURT SO ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR DAYS BETWEEN THE CASE LEAVING THE MAGISTRATES COURT AND THE STARTER CROWN COURT HEARING NOW COMPARED WITH NINETY NINE DAYS TWO YEARS AGO
HE SAYS THAT TIMELY JUSTICE IS A POSTCODE LOTTERY SO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A SEVEN IN TEN CHANCE OF A CROWN COURT TRIAL GOING AHEAD AS SCHEDULED IN NORTH WALES BUT JUST A TWO IN TEN CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING IN GREATER MANCHESTER AND THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE OFFENCE ITSELF BEING COMMITTED AND ARE COMPLETED TRIAL DEFICIENT MASSIVELY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO DAYS IN SOUTH WALES BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY DAYS IN SUSSEX
AND SAYS THERE IS SOME GOOD PRACTICE IN THE WAY COURTS AROUND RUN BUT IT'S NOT CURRENTLY BEING SHARED MORE WIDELY IN IT THAT MEANS THE POORER PERFORMING AREAS AND NOT GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF BETTER AREAS
VERY WORRYINGLY IT SAYS THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH AT D. DOING SUPPORTING VICTIMS ARE WITNESSES THEY'RE VITAL COGS IN THE SYSTEM BUT LISTEN TO THIS ONLY FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN A WITNESS SAY THAT THEY WOULD BE PREPARED TO BE A WITNESS AGAIN THERE ARE LONG WAITS FOR WITNESSES TO GIVE EVIDENCE
IT MAKES THE POINT REALLY THAT THE SYSTEM IS ADMINISTERED BY DIFFERENT PARTS OF GOVERNMENT WITH DIFFERENT BUDGETS AND DIFFERENT PRESSURES AND DECISIONS TAKEN TO CUT IN ONE AREA CAN CREATE INEFFICIENCY AND INCREASE COSTS IN OTHER AREAS AND THAT THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN SIMPLY TO SOLO TO RECOGNISE WHERE THE PROBLEMS AREN'T TO TAKE ACTION TO DEAL WITH IT BUT IT ISN'T IT'S A LITANY OF DEPRESSING USE AND WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT SAY
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS LOOK THERE IS A MAJOR PROGRAMME OF REFORM UNDER WAY WERE INVESTING TWO BILLION POUNDS THEY'RE A BIG REFORMS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF CASE MANAGEMENT SOMETHING CALLED BETTER BETTER CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRESS PROGRAMME THERE IS ALSO
AND ATTEMPT TO DIGITISE REALLY THE ENTIRE COURT SYSTEM THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S FUNDED BY A HUGE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT BUT WHAT THE REPORT SAYS IT LOOK ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO TAKE SOME FOR YEARS TO FULLY COME ON STREAM AND IN THE MEANTIME THERE ARE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE CLIVE COMMON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND OTHER DISCLOSURE THE DETAILS ARE FAR MORE TERRORIST SUSPECTS THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED MAKES THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IT REPORTS THAT THE FINGERPRINTS AND THE D.N.A. OF EIGHT HUNDRED SUSPECTED EXTREMISTS HAVE BEEN ERASED BECAUSE OF ERRORS BY THE POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICES

HAVE BEEN HELD BACK UNTIL THE DAY AFTER THE REFERENDUM IN THE U.K. THE PAPER POINTS OUT THAT SIMILAR PLANS WERE BLOCKED BY BRITAIN IN TWENTY ELEVEN BUT SAYS THERE ARE CONCERNS A LOOPHOLE COULD ALLOW NINE STATES TO GROUP TOGETHER TO GET THE MEASURES THROUGH THIS TIME IT SAYS THE DOCUMENT DRAWN UP BY THE USE FOREIGN POLICY HEAD FEDERICA MUGGER HEANEY WILL BE DISCUSSED AT A SUMMIT
THE WEEK AFTER THE E.U. REFERENCE SEVERAL PAPERS INCLUDING THE DAILY EXPRESS THE MAIL THE SON SEES ON YESTERDAY'S FIGURES SHOWING NET MIGRATION TO THE U.K. AT RECORD LEVELS SEEING THEM AS A BOOST TO BRECHT'S AT CAMPAIGNERS THE MALE CALLS HER FIGURES A HAMMER BLOW TO DAVID CAMERON SAYS THEY LEAVE IS PLEDGED TO CUT THEIR NUMBERS MAYBE BRITAIN TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS IN TATTERS THE SUN SAYS THE FIGURES PROVE BRITAIN CAN'T CONTROL ITS OWN BORDERS CLAIMS MY CAMERA'S TURNED A DEAF EAR IT'S FRONT PAGE MOCKED UP A PICTURE OF THE PRIME MINISTER WITH HIS FINGERS IN HIS EARS
THE GUARDIAN CONTINUES WITH ITS CAMPAIGN TO UNCOVER THESE SECRETIVE FIRM'S BUYING UP BUILDINGS IN LONDON IT SAYS FORTY THOUSAND PROPERTIES ARE NOW IN THE HANDS OF ANONYMOUS OWNERS SHIELDED BY TAX HAVENS INCLUDING PALOMA IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS
THE PAPER'S ANALYSIS OF LAND REGISTRY FIGURES FOUND THAT THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES BEING BOUGHT IN THIS WAY HAD RISEN BY NINE PER CENT IN TEN MONTHS THEN STORE IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES SAYS THE I PHONE MAKE APPLE RAISED THE PROSPECT OF BUYING THE MEDIA GIANT TIME WARNER THE PAPER SOURCES SAY DISCUSSIONS REACHED ONLY A PRELIMINARY LEVELLED NEVER INCLUDED THE CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY THE F.T. SAYS THE REPORT ILLUSTRATES THOUGH APPLES DESIRE TO OFFER ITS OWN CONTENT AND ITS WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER NEW AREAS OF GROWTH AS THE DEMAND FOR ITS CORE PRODUCT SLOWS NEITHER COMPANY WAS WILLING TO COMMENT
AND THE TIMES REPORTS THAT A MUSLIM CLERIC IN SAUDI ARABIA HAS BANNED PEOPLE FROM TAKING SELFIES WITH CATS THE PICTURES HAVE APPARENTLY BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR AS A WAY OF APPEARING MORE WESTERN SHAKE SALOPIAN FILES AND ALTHAUS AND TOLD A LIVE TELEVISION AUDIENCE THAT PHOTOS WITH CATS WERE AGAINST THE NATION'S STRICT INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM THE CLERICS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED RULINGS AGAINST TAKING ANY PICTURES WITH MOBILE PHONES UNLESS COMPLETELY NECESSARY THE PAPER CALLS HIS LATEST EDICT A CAT
WITHOUT EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVER THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING BRITAIN IS POISED TO SEND A WARSHIP TO THE MEDITERRANEAN TO BOLSTER LIBYAN ATTEMPTS TO TACKLE PEOPLE TRAFFICKERS AND TO TARGET AREN'T SMOTHERS THE BUSINESS SECRETARY HAS BEGUN CONSULTING ON PLANS TO CUT THE PENSION BENEFITS GIVEN TO STEELWORKERS AS PART OF EFFORTS TO MAKE TATA STEEL'S U.K. PLANTS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO BUYERS MEDITATES MINISTERS SAY IT IS A ONE OFF CASE BUT YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT THERE WERE FEARS THAT IT COULD LEAD TO WIDER CHANGES IN EFFECT MILLIONS OF PENSIONERS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES
HERE'S OUR CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN WITHIN HOURS OF ARRIVING BACK FROM INDIA WHERE HE'D HAD TALKS WITH THE OWNERS OF TATA STEEL SAGEDE JAVID CONFIRMED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS CONSIDERING CHANGING THE LAW ON PENSIONS THIS FOLLOWS REPRESENTATIONS FROM THE TRUSTEES ON THE SCHEME ITSELF AND ALSO FROM TATA
THE BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME HAS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND A LARGE DEFICIT THE BUSINESS SECRETARY STRESSED THAT THE PLAN TO CUT PENSION BENEFITS BY CHANGING THE RATE OF INFLATION USED TO CALCULATE ANNUAL INCREASES HAD COME FROM THE SCHEMES TRUSTEES
THEY BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO BETTER OUTCOMES FOR THEIR MEMBERS
AND SO OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS MINISTERS WILL CARRY OUT A CONSULTATION ABOUT CHANGING THE RULES UNDER THE SCHEME'S CURRENT RULES THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SOME OF THE CHE WERE ALL THE CHANGES THAT THEY HAVE PROPOSED BUT THEY ARE PREVENTED RIGHTLY SO BY LEGISLATION IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE PENSIONS
AND THEY HAVE ASKED US IF WE WOULD CONSIDER REMOVING THAT PORTION OF THE ACT IN THE CASE OF THEIR SCHEME AND THEIR SCHEME ONLY
SADLY JAVID SAID UNLESS SOME CHANGES WERE MADE THE SCHEME WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO THE GOVERNMENT'S PENSIONS PROTECTION FUND OR P. P. F. WHICH WOULD MEAN LOWER BENEFITS FOR WORKERS AND PENSIONERS
LABOUR'S SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY ANGELA EAGLE SAID SHE RECOGNISED THERE WERE NO EASY OPTIONS BUT SHE SAID ANY SOLUTION HAD TO PROTECT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE PENSION SCHEME AND AVOID SETTING A PRECEDENT FOR MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE
THE SUGGESTED MOVE FROM A P.I. TO C.P.I. FOR THE BRITISH STEEL PENSION SCHEME RISKS SETTING A VERY WORRYING PRECEDENT FOR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL SCHEMES AS THE HOUSE WILL KNOW THIS CHANGE IS CURRENTLY ILLEGAL
AND SHE WANTED TO KNOW HOW CHANGING THE RULES MIGHT AFFECT WORKERS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES WHAT ASSURANCE CAN THE SECRETARY OF STATE GIVE ME THAT THIS PROPOSED TRAINS WILL NOT BE EXTENDED IN THE FUTURE TO OTHER OCCUPATIONAL SCHEMES CAN THIS CHANGE THESE SENSIBLY AND SAFELY RING FENCED BECAUSE IF NOT IT'S VERY VARIED
THE BUSINESS SECRETARY REPEATED THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THE PENSION SCHEME WANTED TO DO BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD MEAN THAT IN ALMOST EVERY CASE THEIR MEMBERS WOULD BE EITHER BETTER OFF OR NO WORSE OFF
YES M. P. SPOKESMAN NEIL GRAY WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THE LACK OF DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HE CALLED AN INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE ISSUE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD SET A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT UNDERMINES WORKPLACE PENSIONS AN INCENTIVE INCENTIVES TO SAVE TO SECURE DIGNITY IN RETIREMENT AND DO YOU DRIVE
THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF COMMUNITY SID SAID THIS MORNING WE'RE NOT TAKING ANYTHING OFF THE TABLE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ANY CHANGE IN THE WATER SEE IF STEELWORKERS PENSIONS WE'RE NOT HAVING AN IMPACT ON OTHER PENSION SCHEMES
IT SOON BECAME CLEAR THAT MANY OTHER M. PEAS SHARED THOSE CONCERNS SUCH JUDE JAVID INSISTED IT WAS AN OPEN CONSULTATION NO DECISIONS HAD BEEN MADE AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS WARY OF SETTING A PRECEDENT OR CONSERVATIVE DAVID MOWAT THOUGHT THE MINISTER WAS TALKING ABOUT CHANGING AN IMPORTANT POINT OF PRINCIPLE
COULD YOU TELL THE HOUSE WHETHER OR NOT IT ALONE THE CHANGE TO THE INDEX ASIAN ALONE WILL
PUT THE FUN INTO SURPLUS BUT IF IT IS STILL IN DEFICIT AFTER THIS CHANGE IS THAT
POSSIBILITY IN FUTURE A P. P. F. REFERRAL WILL MEAN A DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR THEM
MISTER JAVID SAID THE TRUSTEES BELIEVED THE CHANGE WOULD MOVE THE SCHEME INTO SURPLUS LABOUR M.P. STEPHEN CANNOCK ASKED ABOUT REPORTS THAT TARTAR MIGHT RE THINK DECISION TO SELL OFF ITS U.K. PLANTS IF THE PENSION CHANGES WENT AHEAD
COULD THE SECRETARY OF STATE EXPLAINED IF THAT WORKS
WHAT ROLE TATA STEEL WOULD PLAY IN THIS ISSUE OF DEALING WITH A PENSION
MISTER SPEAKER AND THERE'S ALL SORTS OF SPECULATION ON THIS ISSUE IN THE PRESS BUT WHAT I CAN TELL THE GENTLEMAN WHO I KNOW HAS BEEN VERY COMMITTED TO THIS PROCESS WE DISCUSSED IT IN PERSON A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT TART ITSELF REMAINS COMMITTED AND VERY FOCUSED ON THE SALES PROCESS
TATA'S BIGGEST PLANT AT PORT TALBOT EMPLOYS MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THE LEAD REPLIED CURRY AT WESTMINSTER HOWELL WILLIAMS SAID HIS PARTY WAS RESOLUTE IN ITS SUPPORT OF THE STEEL INDUSTRY
SUPPORTERS IN SON KNOTS EFFECTING THE PENSIONS OF COAL AND STEEL WORKERS AND
STEEL PENSIONERS SATYA JAVID INSISTED THE GOVERNMENT HADN'T MADE A DECISION BUT HE SAID IF THE PROPOSED CHANGES DIDN'T GO AHEAD THE PENSION SCHEME WOULD END UP IN THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND
SEAN CURRAN REPORTING IN HIM OR FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT OVER ON THE LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO AS WELL TIME NOW THIRTY MINUTES TO SEVEN SCOTLAND IS NOT DOING AS WELL AS ENGLAND IN GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE FROM POOR BACKGROUNDS INTO UNIVERSITY AND YET UNLIKE ENGLAND EDUCATION IN UNIVERSITIES IS FREE IT DOESN'T HAVE TUITION FEES BUT IT DOES HAVE A CAP ON PLACES AND REPORT FROM EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY IN THE SUTTON TRUST THE CZECH EDUCATION CHARITY
FOUND THAT MEANS DISADVANTAGE PUPILS ARE MORE LIKELY TO LOSE OUT LUCY HUNTER BLACKBURN IS THE LEAD ACADEMIC AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY BEHIND THE REPORT AND JOINS US FROM EDINBURGH NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON THAT THERE IS THIS WHAT IT'S A STRIKING GIRL
WELL THEY WANT A REPORT FOUND WAS THAT BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND YOUNG PEOPLE FROM POOR BACKGROUNDS WHERE THEY WERE
FOUR TIMES LESS LIKELY TO ATTEND UNIVERSITY IN SCOTLAND BUT ONLY TWO AND A HALF TIMES LIKELY LESS LIKELY IN ENGLAND AND PARTLY WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IS THAT THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO APPLY BUT IT'S ALSO LEFT THEM LESS LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY DO APPLY IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE BEHIND THAT IS A TIGHTER SUPPLY OF PLACES IN SCOTLAND
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD INTRODUCED TUITION FEES IT AS IN ENGLAND AND THAT WOULD PUT PEOPLE OFF GOING CERTAINLY POORER PEOPLE THAT THERE ISN'T ANY EVIDENCE OF
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT ALL PARTS OF THE U.K. ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH WIDENING ACCESSING AT AN IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE AND THIS BUT CLEARLY IN SCOTLAND THE OVERALL LEVELS OF DEBT ASSOCIATED WITH GOING TO UNIVERSITY ARE LOWER BUT IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE DATA THERE IS THERE IS NO SIGN THAT DIFFERENT SUFI POLICY IS IS MAKING ANY DIFFERENCE I'LL GIVE YOU SCOTLAND AN AGE IN WIPE THE EXCESS AND SO IT'S
THE AD THE SECOND ASPECT OF THIS IS THE CAP YOU SUGGEST WELL CLEARLY BECAUSE THE SCOTTISH SYSTEM IS FULLY FUNDED BY THE STATE IT DOES I KNOW BUT THIS HAS BEEN AN OPEN UNDERSTANDING THING IN SCOTLAND YOU JUST GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO GO INTO IT CAN CONTROL THE COST SO AS A RESULT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A SYSTEM IN SCOTLAND WERE ACCEPT ITS RACE ACROSS A BORDER ACTUALLY FOR ALL TYPES OF STUDENTS ARE LOWER
I HAVEN'T BUT THAT AS A PARTICULARLY HITTING THOSE STUDENTS WHO TEND TO COME FROM A UNIVERSE OF SUFFICIENT SCHOOLS DON'T PERFORM AS WELL IF YOU CAN'T COMPETE SO HARD ON ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR RESEARCH IS THE ANSWER THAT SCOTLAND SHOULD FOLLOW ENGLAND AND INTRODUCE TUITION FEES AND REMOVE THE CAP NO I THINK THE IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE IS THAT YOU CAN'T NOT LOOK AT THE DIRT DIFFERENT AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT LOOKS AT AND OBVIOUSLY CARES ABOUT IN POLICY MAKING AND IT'S THEIR DECISION
TO HAVE FREE TUITION AND THERE'S NO SIGN AT ALL I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE SO THE QUESTION REMEMBER MY QUESTION WAS DIFFERENT IS WHETHER IT SHOULD CHANGE I THINK THEY WERE OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE DONE IT IN SCOTLAND OVER RECENT YEARS IS PUT IN MORE PLACES WHICH ARE RING FENCED FOR MORE DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE DATA THAT THAT HAS HAD AN EFFECT PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF IMPROVING THEIR ACCESS TO YE OLDE UNIVERSITIES
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS THAT THAT SORT OF SCHEME REALLY DOES NEED TO CONTINUE YOU NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT SPACE IN THE SYSTEM FOR THOSE STUDENTS IF YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO COPE WITH WITH WHAT'S OTHERWISE QUITE A SORT OF CONSTRAINED SYSTEM O.K. BUT AND I UNDERSTAND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE POLITICS AND SAYING THIS ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE I'M JUST WONDERING IF WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RAW DATA OF THE DIFFERENCE OF TRYING TO GET POORER PEOPLE INTO UNIVERSITIES WHETHER ACTUALLY YOU WOULD FOLLOW THE ENGLISH MODEL
WELL I THINK THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO WEIGH UP VARIOUS THINGS AND THEY LOOK AT THEIR STUDENT FUNDING SYSTEM AND THE LEVELS OF DEBT OR ONE THING FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO DO GET IN IT'S A LEGITIMATE THING FOR THEM TO LOOK AT AND WORRY ABOUT SO IT REALLY IS MORE OF A QUESTION I THINK ABOUT HOW THEY WORK IN THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE GOT AND RECOGNISING THAT FREE TUITION DOESN'T OF ITSELF REALLY REALLY PUSH UP OR HELP WITH THE SUCCESS OF GETTING POORLY YOUNG PUPILS
LUCY HAD TO BLACKBURN THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIME MY MINISTER SEVEN NOW HOW IS THE REFERENDUM DEBATE ON OUR FUTURE IN THE E.U. PLAYING OUT NORTHERN IRELAND MICHELLE IS IN LONDONDERRY ALL THIS MORNING IN THE LATEST OF A SERIES OF REPORTS AROUND THE COUNTRY AHEAD OF JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD MICHELLE MORNING TO YOU YOU WERE FARMERS
MORNING JUSTIN YES WHERE IN NORTH WEST ULSTER THIS MORNING WHEN PEOPLE HERE TALK ABOUT THE REPUBLIC THEY SAY THE SOUTH BUT IT'S REALLY OUT TO THE WEST FROM WHERE WE ARE ON THE LENNON FARM JUST OUTSIDE LONDONDERRY AND WE ARE HERE BECAUSE AGRICULTURE IS SUCH A BIG PART OF THE ECONOMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THEREFORE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF HOW PEOPLE HERE SEE THE YOU IT'S INTERESTING THAT SINCE I ARRIVED YESTERDAY I'VE HEARD NO MENTION OF IMMIGRATION BEING AN ISSUE IN THIS
REFERENDUM FOR PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND BUT I HAVE HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT MONEY THE U.K. CONTRIBUTION TO THE E.U. AND THE FUNDS THAT COME BACK TO NORTHERN IRELAND FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FORM OF FARMING SUBSIDIES AND I'M JOINED HERE BY ROBERT MOORE WHOSE FAMILY HAS FARMED HERE AT MALONE AND FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS
GROWS BARLEY WHEAT OATS OILSEED RAPE AND HE ALSO HAS BEEF CATTLE AND BY WILLIAM TAYLOR WHO'S A BEEF AND SHEEP FARMER FROM NEARBY COLERAINE AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND COORDINATOR FOR THE PRESSURE GROUP FARMERS FOR ACTION YOU K. N. WHICH IS IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE E.U. AND WILLIAM TAYLOR I WOULD ASSUME THAT THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE FARMING SUBSIDIES
WELL YOU'RE PARTLY RIGHT LET ME BE CLEAR WHETHER WE STAY IN THE E.U. WHERE THERE WE LEAVE
THEN EVERYBODY ASSUMES THAT FARMERS WILL GET SUBSIDIES BUT THE PART THAT'S ALWAYS MESSING IS THAT THEIR CORPORATE FOOD GIANTS TAKE THE SUBSIDIES FROM FARMERS BY STEALTH
SO THEREFORE WE HAVE A PROBLEM ON FARM INCOMES A PROBLEM THAT WE THINK WE CAN RESOLVE BY STAYING IN THE Y. U. ANOTHER WORDS HOLDING THE E.U. T. A COUNT ON THE LEGISLATION TREATIES AND PROMISES THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE IN OTHER WORDS YOU PROMISES
ARTICLE THIRTY NINE B. OF THE LISBON TREATY THAT RURAL DWELLERS IN SHORT ARE TO BE A REWARD FOR THEIR WORK THIS IS NOT HAPPENING SO WE WANT TO HOLD THEM TO ACCOUNT ON NUTSO WE SAY STAY IN AND FORCE THEM TO WALK THE WALK ROBERT MORE YOU SEE THIS RATHER DIFFERENTLY
WE AGREE ON MANY THINGS WERE SO DO I. I THINK IF WE STAY WE WON'T GET ANY CHANGE BRITAIN HAS IN THE BIGGEST THORN IN THE SIDE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR MANY YEARS
AND I THINK IF WE VOTE TO STAY AND THEN TRY TO CHANGE THINGS THE REST OF EUROPE WOULD YOU SAY LOOK EITHER PUT UP OR SHUT UP BUT IN PURELY FINANCIAL TERMS IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF SUBSIDY THAT DOES COME INTO THIS REGION FARMING SUBSIDY I MEAN FROM FROM THE Y. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS A YEAR COULD YOU SURVIVE WE FELT
I THINK YOU HAVE TO START BY LOOKING AT THE TOTAL INCOME FROM FARMING LAST YEAR WHICH WAS IN NORTHERN IRELAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE MILLION THAT'S FIFTY THREE MILLION POUNDS LESS THAN WE GET IN AND SUBSIDIES IT EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS ON AVERAGE POOR FROM BUSINESS
IF I EMPLOY SOMEBODY I HAVE TO LEGALLY PAY THEM DOUBLE UP THAT LEVEL IS CLEARLY UNSUSTAINABLE AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND I DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T DO THAT EVEN IF WE LEAVE SO YOU'D BE LOOKING FOR A GREATER LEVEL OF SUPPORT FROM THE U.K. GOVERNMENT THEN YOU GET AT THE MOMENT FROM THE E.U. NO NOT NECESSARILY I THINK A DIFFERENT SYSTEM WOULDN'T WOODS
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS WITHIN THE SUPPLY TRAIN AS WILLIAM HILL'S ALLUDED TO THE WE ARE NOT GETTING A FAIR SHARE OF MARGINS WERE THAN THE SUPPLY TRUE BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE E.U. POLICY IS PARTLY MAYBE GREATLY TO BLAME FOR THAT AND YET YOU SEE THE E.U. AS BEING A POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO THAT
LET ME CLARIFY THE SITUATION I HAVE BEEN TO BRUSSELS AS INDEED ROBERT HAS AND WE UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS AND TEXT YOU HAVE THE COMMISSION WHO WORKED FOR THE PURPOSE THAT THEY SERVE
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT THAT SERVES ITS PURPOSE AND YOU HAVE THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS WHO IN EFFECT EITHER GUYS THAT HOLD THE PURSE STRINGS AND CONTROL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WHAT THE E.U. DOES FINANCIALLY BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS
THAT WE ARE NOT GETTING OUR FAIR SHARE OF THE KICK AS ROBERT HAS A LID IT TEA AND WE THEREFORE HAVE TO FIND A WAY FORWARD TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BEFORE ALL OUR FARMERS GO BANKRUPT SO FOR US THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TO PAY ANY MORE FOR THEIR FOOD ALTHOUGH THE NORMAL INFLATIONARY INCREASES
WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS IS THAT WE NEED LEGISLATION IN PLACE TO FORCE THE CORPORATES THE CORPORATE FOOD GIANTS TO PAY FARMERS PROPERLY FOR THEIR PRODUCE AND YOU THINK THAT USE A BETTER PLACE TO DO THAT ALTHOUGH YOU'RE ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE REFERENDUM DEBATE THE STRONG SENSE I GET FROM YOU IS HOW HARD IT IS TO EARN A LIVING LET ALONE A DECENT LIVING FROM A FARM LIKE THIS
YES HE'S BECOME RIDICULOUS PARTICULARLY THE LAST FEW YEARS THIS CONVERSATION WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT IF WE WERE AT LEAST GETTING COST OF PRODUCTION AND THEN THE E.U. SUBSIDY THAT WE WOULD BE OUR OWN COMFORT BUT NOW THAT WE'VE GONE BELOW THAT THE E.U. IS DOING NOTHING YOU'RE SAYING NOTHING TO EITHER OF US TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THAT THEY DO SEEM TO HAVE A PLAN THEY'VE LOST ALL DIRECTION
I DON'T THINK IT'S BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY FOR THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD TO DEVISE A BETTER SYSTEM SO WOULDN'T IT BE A SIMPLER FRAMEWORK TO TO TO GET WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF WILLIAM TAYLOR IF YOU WERE JOE IF YOU WERE JUST WITH U.K. GOVERNMENT BRIEFLY
WELL THE U.K. GOVERNMENT HAS HAD TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS JUST TO HELP TO DO SOMETHING FOR FARMERS AND THEY HAVE TOTALLY IGNORED THE SITUATION BECAUSE
LIKE THE Y. YE THERE IN BED WITH THE CORPORATE O.K. BUT YOU BUT NEVERTHELESS YOU DID WELL YES HE USED SO YOU STILL THINK THE EWES ARE BETTER
BETTER FRAMEWORK TO DO BUSINESS IN PURELY BECAUSE THERE IS A LEGAL WRIT FOR US TO ACHIEVE OUR LEGISLATION ON FIND GET PRICELESS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN NORTHERN IRELAND WILLIAM TAYLOR ROBERT MORE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THIS ONE'S ONLY ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE IRISH BORDER BUT AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK WE WILL BE RIGHT ON THAT BORDER TO EXPLORE THEIR PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT ARISE THERE DUST AND SARAH BACK TO YOU THANKS VERY MUCH MICHELLE IT'S THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR WEATHER FORECASTING PHIL AVERY'S HERE

LAST SUNDAY THE NEW LIBYAN GOVERNMENT ASKED THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR MORE HELP IN TRAINING IT'S NAVY AND COASTGUARD TO STOP THE TRAFFICKING OF MIGRANTS ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN
DAVID CAMERON HAS NOW PROMISED WORLD LEADERS AT THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT THAT HE WILL SEND A WARSHIP TO DO JUST THAT
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN THE EAVES EXPECTED IN COMING WEEKS TO EXTEND THE MANDATE OF ITS CURRENT NAVAL OPERATION WHICH HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO STOP THE TRAFFICKING
THE U.K. CURRENTLY HAS ONE SURVEY BESSEL H.M.S. ENTERPRISE OPERATING IN THE AREA
OFFICIALS SAID THEY WOULD SEEK U.N. APPROVAL SO THAT THE NEW WARSHIP COULD ALSO SEES BOATS THAT ARE SMUGGLING ARMS TO ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS IN LIBYA
AND THEY SUGGESTED THE WARSHIP COULD ALSO OPERATE FOR THE FIRST TIME WITHIN LIBYAN TERRITORIAL WATERS ONCE IT HAD BEEN INVITED IN BY THE GOVERNMENT IN TRIPOLI WHICH THEY EXPECTED SOON
IF IT DOES THEN BRITAIN WILL HAVE MOVED YET ANOTHER STEP CLOSER TO DIRECT TO MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN THE LIBYAN CONFLICT

DESPITE CRITICISMS THAT IT IS A CYNICAL ATTEMPT TO DIVERT ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE INCREASING EUROPEAN UNION IMMIGRATION THE GOVERNMENT HAS INSISTED IT'S PENSIONS ANALYSIS IS ROBUST THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POUNDS A YEAR FIGURE COMES FROM A STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF A RISING INFLATION WHICH THE TREASURY SAYS COULD FOLLOW BRECHT'S IT AND WOULD ERODE THE VALUE OF PENSION INCREASES
A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF STOCK MARKETS COULD ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT AS PENSION FUNDS ARE WIDELY INVESTED IN SHARES SOME ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT MARKET VOLATILITY WOULD INCREASE IF BRITAIN LEFT THE E.U. A PENSIONER WITH A PENSION POT TOTALLING SIXTY THOUSAND COULD SEE ITS VALUE DROPPED BY UP TO FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED POUNDS THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED
POLLING EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT OLDER PEOPLE TEND TO BE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO BRECHT'S IT AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO FRIGHTEN THE VOTERS INTO SUPPORTING THE U.K. REMAINING IN THE Y.
IT ALSO FACED CRITICISM FOR PUBLISHING THE FIGURES JUST TWO HOURS BEFORE PURDAH RULES KICKED IN AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM THE RULE STOP THE GOVERNMENT USING ITS OWN OFFICIALS TO PRODUCE Y. YOU INFORMATION TO ENSURE THERE IS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN THE TWO CAMPAIGN
THE FORMER FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLAND ALEX SALMOND HAS PREDICTED A VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD PROMPT A FRESH REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE WITHIN TWO YEARS SPEAKING AT THE B. B. C. DEBATE IN GLASGOW LAST NIGHT MY SALMON SUGGESTED AN INDEPENDENCE VOTE WOULD TAKE PLACE IF THE U.K. AS A WHOLE OPTED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE E.U. BUT A MAJORITY OF SCOTS WANTED TO REMAIN A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON REPORT
AT THE B.B.C.'S Y. U. DEBATE LAST NIGHT ALEX SALMOND DIDN'T JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS REFERENDUM BUT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER ONE HE REMINDED THE AUDIENCE OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THE S.N.P. WOULD SEE HER VOTE TO LEAVE THE Y. YOU ARE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY LEAD TO A NEW THOUGHT ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE
BUT HE ALSO PUT A TIGHT TIMESCALE ON IT HE SAID IF ENGLAND'S DRAGGED SCOTLAND OUT OF THE E. U. AGAINST ITS WILL THEY KNEW REFERENDUM SHOULD BE HELD WITHIN TWO YEARS DURING THE PERIOD WHEN THE U.K. GOVERNMENT WOULD BE NEGOTIATING IT'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS SUCCESS OF SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON TALK TO B. B. C. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS SUCH AN OUTCOME AS SHE WAS PUTTING ALL HER ENERGIES INTO WINNING A OUGHT TO REMAIN
M.P.S ARE WARNING THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS CLOSE TO BREAKING POINT IN A DAMNING REPORT THE COMMONS PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS VICTIMS AND WITNESSES ARE BEING LET DOWN AND CUB ARE THREATENING THE ABILITY OF THE CHORDS TO DELIVER JUSTICE IT'S A LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CLIVE COLEMAN
TODAY'S REPORT IS PEPPERED WITH WORRYING FINDINGS POOR PERFORMANCE IN SUPPORTING VICTIMS AND WITNESSES ONLY FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WITNESSES SAID THEY'D BE ONE AGAIN AND A START POSTCODE LOTTERY FOR JUSTICE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A SEVEN IN TEN CHANCE OF A CROWN COURT TRIAL GOING AHEAD AS SCHEDULED IN NORTH WALES BUT JUST A TWO IN TEN CHANCE IN GREATER MANCHESTER
THE REPORT SAYS THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN TOO SLOW TO ADDRESS FAILINGS AND HAS EXHAUSTED THE SCOPE FOR CARTS GOVERNMENT REFORMS TO MANAGE CASES MORE EFFICIENTLY AND DIGITISE EVIDENCE ARE ACKNOWLEDGED BUT WON'T BE FULLY EFFECTIVE FOR FOUR YEARS
THE M.P.S SAY IMPROVEMENTS SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS WELCOMED THE REPORT SAYING THAT THE NEED FOR URGENT CHANGE HAS LED TO ITS REFORMS AND TWO BILLION POUNDS OF INVESTMENT
IT'S EMERGED THE ACCIDENTAL DELETION OF FINGERPRINTS AND D.N.A. RECORDS OF TERRORISM SUSPECTS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED IN MARCH WAS ALMOST TWICE AS EXTENSIVE AS ORIGINALLY DISCLOSED THE BIOMETRICS COMMISSIONER ALISDAIR MACGREGOR NOW SAYS EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN PROFILES WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR DATABASE BEFORE NATIONAL SECURITY CHECKS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT THE HOME OFFICE SAID POLICE WOULD KEEP THE MATTER UNDER CLOSE REVIEW
RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT SCOTLAND IS LAGGING BEHIND ENGLAND WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE FROM POORER BACKGROUNDS INTO UNIVERSITY DESPITE THE ABOLITION OF TUITION FEES BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT A REPORT BY THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH AND THE SUTTON TRUST SAYS THE CAP ON THE NUMBER OF UNIVERSITY PLACES IN SCOTLAND ALSO MEANS STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET IN HIS ART EDUCATION EDITOR BRAMAH JEFFERIES
OUTSIDE HERRIOT WHAT UNIVERSITY STANDS A STONE MONUMENT TO THE ABOLITION OF TUITION FEES IN SCOTLAND THE FLAGSHIP POLICY OF THE S.N.P. HAS SAVED STUDENTS FROM FUTURE DEBT BUT SEEMS TO HAVE DONE LITTLE FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY STUDENTS FROM THE WEALTHIEST FAMILIES OF FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO GO STRAIGHT TO UNIVERSITY THAN THOSE FROM THE POOREST BACKGROUNDS
THAT'S A BIGGER GAP THAN THE REST OF THE U.K. MOST OF THE GROWTH IN HIGHER EDUCATION STUDIES FOR POORER STUDENTS HAS BEEN IN COLLEGES AND NOT UNIVERSITIES THE GREATEST IMPACT HAS BEEN FROM A SCHEME TO RING FENCE PLACES IN TOP SCOTTISH UNIVERSITIES FOR DISADVANTAGE PUPILS BUT FROM THIS YEAR THEY'LL BE ABSORBED INTO THE TOTAL THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S INCREASING SUPPORT THROUGH GRANTS AND LOANS FOR MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR THE POORER STUDENTS
THE AUTHORITIES IN THAILAND SAY ONE BRITISH TOURIST HAS DIED IN ANOTHER IS MISSING AFTER THE SPEEDBOAT IN WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELLING CAPSIZED TWO OTHER WOMEN ALSO DIED POLICE REPORTED THAT THE BOAT HIT A LARGE WAVE THAN OVERTURNED OFF THE ISLAND OF XHOSA MOVIE IT WAS CARRYING THIRTY TWO TOURISTS AND FOUR CREW OF SOUTH EAST ASIA CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HEADS REPORTS FROM BANGKOK
THIS MORNING RESCUE WORKERS FOUND THE BODY OF A THIRD VICTIM OF THE BOAT ACCIDENT A WOMAN FROM HONG KONG ONE BRITISH MAN IS STILL MISSING
SEVEN PEOPLE REMAIN IN HOSPITAL WITH SERIOUS INJURIES AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE BODIES OF TWO WOMEN ONE BRITISH THE OTHER GERMAN WHO DIED AFTER BEING TRAPPED UNDER THE CAPSIZED BOAT THE POLICE HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THE SEA WAS ROUGH AND THE WIND'S STRONG AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED JUST THREE HUNDRED METRES FROM THE SHORE
DOZENS OF FAST TOUR BOATS GO OUT EVERY DAY FROM THE ISLAND OF KO SIMILE TAKING TOURISTS TO SNORKEL AND KAYAK IN THE CRYSTAL BLUE SEAS OF THE ANTON NATIONAL PARK
THE POLICE SAY THE BOAT WAS LICENSED TO CARRY FORTY FIVE PASSENGERS SO IT WAS NOT OVERLOADED
BARACK OBAMA WILL BECOME THE FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT THE JAPANESE CITY OF HIROSHIMA THIS MORNING HE'S ALREADY SAID HE WILL NOT OFFER AN APOLOGY FOR THE DROPPING OF THE ATOMIC BOMB ON THE CITY IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE BUT WILL INSTEAD HONOUR ALL THOSE WHO WERE LOST IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR
IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN BRITAIN IS SENDING A NAVY WARSHIP TO HELP SUPPORT THE LIBYAN COAST GUARD STOP PEOPLE TRAFFICKING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN DAVID CAMERON MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT TO WORLD LEADERS AT THE G.SEVEN MEETING IN JAPAN HE SPEAKING AT THE MOMENT THE U.K. ALREADY HAS A SURVEY VESSEL OPERATING IN THE AREA AND THE GOVERNMENT ALSO WANTS THE NEW SHIP TO BE ABLE TO SEE THESE BOATS WHO WERE SUSPECTED OF SMUGGLING ARMS TO SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IN LIBYA
WELL CHRIS PARRY USED TO BE A REAR ADMIRAL IN THE ROYAL NAVY HE WAS ALSO A NATO COMMANDER AND FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE AND JOINS US FROM PORTSMOUTH NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DIFFERENCE YOU THINK THIS SHIP CAN MAKE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING
I THINK ANY SITUATION CAN BE MADE BETTER BY A NAVY WARSHIP BUT AT THE MOMENT UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT TYPE OF WARSHIP AND WHAT ROLE IT'S GOING TO UNDERTAKE I THINK BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING AT THE G. SEVEN AND WE HAVE A REFERENDUM THIS HAS THE NATURE OF A GRAND GESTURE I DON'T THINK THE DETAILS HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT YET QUITE FRANKLY OH KAY BUT WERE GIVEN THE THE VARIATIONS OF THE TYPE OF WARSHIP WHAT DIFFERENCE COULD IT MEAN
IT GIVES YOU SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES IF IT HAS HELICOPTERS AND ASSAULT CRAFT IT CAN INTERCEPT ARMS SMUGGLERS AND ALSO MIGRANT BOATS IF IT'S A SIZEABLE WARSHIP HE CAN TAKE MIGRANTS ON BOARD BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS AN ATTEMPT REALLY TO BOLSTER THE Y. U. OPERATION WHICH SO FAR HAS BEEN PRETTY INADEQUATE BOTH IN TERMS OF GETTING
MIGRANTS TO STOP COMING TO SEE AND ALSO IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY ENFORCING SOME SORT OF CONTROL OVER ISLAMIC SHAPE BUT WHAT WE DO SEEM TO KNOW IS THAT IT THIS IS IT IT'S A REQUEST FROM LIBYA TO SUPPORT THEIR COAST GUARD I SUPPOSE ONE DOESN'T KNOW AS A RESULT OF THAT WHAT HOW THAT SUPPORT WOULD WORK WHETHER IT WILL MEAN PICKING PEOPLE OUT OF THE SEA I THINK BEFORE WE STOP PICKING PEOPLE OUT OF THE SEA I THINK IT HAS BIG KNOWLEDGE THAT LIBYA BARELY HAS A COASTGUARD IT'S UNABLE TO PATROL AND CONTROL ITS TERRITORIAL SEAS
AND THAT IS WHY WE SEE SO MANY MIGRANTS AT SEA WE CAN HAVE START TRAINING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START EQUIPPING AND ALSO HELPING ANY LIBYAN AUTHORITY TO GET A COASTGUARD AT SEA THAT'S GOING TO BE A LONG JOB IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN IMMEDIATE FIX AND CERTAINLY WON'T DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF THIS SUMMER SOME PEOPLE OF COURSE WILL SUGGESTED IT TAKES THE U.K. CLOSER TO DIRECT MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN LIBYA WHERE WE KNOW OF COURSE THE S.A.S. OPERATE
WELL I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A CASE FOR MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN LIBYA WE'VE GOT A LOT OF TERRORISTS SITTING INSERT HEY RIGHT NOW THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO ATTACK EUROPE IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY DO WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT A MILITARY OPERATION THE CLOSER WE OPERATE TO LIBYA SHORES THE MORE INTELLIGENCE MORE SURVEILLANCE AND THE MORE DIRECT PRESSURE WE CAN PUT ON THE ISLAMIC STATE THE BETTER
INTO IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS SHIP CAN DO IT SO IT'S A BIT OF THE WAY IF WE ASSUME IT'S HELPING AND TRAINING THE COASTGUARD DOES THAT MEAN IT IS ALL SO POLICING THE WATERS
WELL YES I MEAN AS LONG AS THEY GET AN INVITATION FROM THE LIBYAN AUTHORITIES AND ALSO PERHAPS UNITED NATIONS MANDATE THEY CAN DO QUITE A LOT OF GOOD THEY CAN INTERCEPT ANYTHING ILLEGAL ANYTHING THAT IS GOING ON THAT SHOULDN'T BE OFF THE SHORE BUT OF COURSE IT HAS TO LOOK AFTER ITSELF IT'S NO GOOD SENDING A MINE HUNTER FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEND A FAIRLY UPFRONT HIGHLY CAPABLE FRIGATE OR DESTROY I SUSPECT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO GO IN HARM'S WAY IF THEY GO CLOSE IN
BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT A WARSHIP BUT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT I THINK IS SIGNIFICANT HERE IS THAT WE'RE HAVING TO BOOST THE E.U. OPERATION WE HAVE PLENTY OF WARNING LAST YEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE PROBLEMS OFF LIBYA BOTH IN TERMS OF MIGRANTS AND IN TERMS OF SECURITY AND YET HERE WE ARE BRITAIN'S HAVING TO COMMIT A WARSHIP WERE PUTTING PLANNERS INTO OPERATION SOPHIA IN ROME AND THAT JUST SHOWS HOW OUR PARTNERS IN EUROPE ARE ACTUALLY LEANING ON US IN MILITARY TERMS TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY CHRIS BARRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN LET'S GO BACK TO THE DEBATE ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION DAVID CAMERON ACTUALLY HE'S AT THE G.SEVEN MEETING AND HE'S TALKING AT THE MOMENT ABOUT BRECK'S SELECTIVE LISTENING DIGITAL THAT'S MASSIVE BENEFITS TO BRITAIN BECAUSE WE ARE THE DIGITAL AND TECH LEADER IN EUROPE IF WE COMPLETE THE SINGLE MARKET AND SERVICES A MASSIVE BOOST TO BRITAIN BECAUSE WE ARE OF THE NUMBER ONE
FOR BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL SERVICES IN EUROPE IF WE COMPLETE THE SINGLE MARKET IN ENERGY AGAIN BRITAIN IS A BIG PLAYER IN ENERGY WITH SOME OF EUROPE'S BEST ENERGY BUSINESSES ARE MOST INNOVATIVE THINKING SO IT'S A VERY POSITIVE ARGUMENT ABOUT THE ECONOMY THEY WERE MAKING ABOUT THE FUTURE
BUT IT IS ALSO ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO WARN PEOPLE OF THE RISKS AND THE DANGERS RISK THAT I'VE BEEN SET OUT BY THE G. TWENTY BY THE G. SEVEN BY ALL THESE OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS WHO HAVE AN INTEREST IN WANTING BRITAIN
TO DO WELL THERE WE ARE DAVID CAMERON TALKING ALIVE AT THE G. SEVEN ADD THE GOVERNMENT IS TELLING US THIS MORNING AS WELL AS THOSE THINGS THAT PENSIONERS AND THOSE PLANNING RETIREMENT WILL BE WORSE OFF IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SAY NUMBER ONE IS THAT TRUE NUMBER TWO HE'S BEEN A BIT UNDER HAND OF THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THAT SUGGESTION ONLY HOURS BEFORE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE BANNED BY THE CIRCLE PURDAH RULES THAT ARE THERE TO GUARANTEE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM IAN DUNCAN SMITH ON THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY OF COURSE PART OF IT
CAMPAIGNERS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE ON PENSIONS IS THAT IT IS PRETTY CLEAR IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY RETIRED OR ABOUT TO RETIRE YOU WILL BE WORSE OFF IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN
UM IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO BEING AN ABSURD STATEMENT REALLY ACTUALLY EUROPE EARLIER ON I NOTICED IN YOUR PROGRAMME
YOU HAD A PENSIONS EXPERT IN WHO MADE THIS POINT RATHER FORCIBLY I THOUGHT IN WHICH HE POINTED OUT THAT THE THING ABOUT PENSION SAVINGS IS AND AS YOU BUILD UP THAT POT OF MONEY OF COURSE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME YOU WILL HAVE ECONOMIC MOMENTS WHEN RECESSION TAKES PLACE THERE HIS GROWTH BUT OVER THAT PERIOD BY AND LARGE THAT PENSION SAVINGS POT EVENS OUT ACROSS A LONGER PERIOD
THAT IS EXACTLY THE CASE WITH THIS SO OF COURSE THEY HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN MOMENTS OF RECESSION WHEN THEY RETURNED ON SAVINGS HAVE FALLEN AND THEN GROWTH WHEN THEY HAVE RISEN TO A HIGH LEVEL IN THE PENSIONS
THE MYSTERIES OF HER HAVE ADJUSTED THEIR SAVINGS BUT DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THERE MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHEN PENSION SAME IS THE VALUE OF PENSIONS WELL SLIGHTLY FOR A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT I THINK JUST ON THIS POINT I'D BE BEEN QUITE QUITE SIGNIFICANT FIGURES INCLUDING HARGREAVES LANDS DOWN NOT BIG PENSIONS COMPANY SAY THERE COULD BE A SHORT TERM IMPACT ON U.K. PENSIONERS DO YOU ACCEPT IT PLEASE THAT YET LOOK EVERY TIME IF YOU HAD A RECESSION YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT
THAT YOU KNOW RECESSIONS HAVE A SHORT I MEAN ABOUT OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME THEY DON'T AND SAVINGS ACTUALLY EVEN OUT SO MY POINT IS FIRST I DON'T ACCEPT THERE WILL BE A SHORT TERM SHOCK TO THE U.K.'S ECONOMY IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IS QUITE INTERESTING WHAT OR EVEN YOUR PENSION ADVISOR SAID ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT HE SAID IN THE REPORT BY THE WAY THIS IS RE HASH FROM MONDAY'S REPORT THIS WAS IN THE MONDAY REPORT THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ON MONDAY AND THEY TOSS IT OUT JUST BEFORE
THEY GO TO PURDAH BUT IN THAT REPORT IT ACTUALLY TAKES TO HAVE THE WORST POSSIBLE CASE IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE FOR WHAT FOR EXAMPLE THEY TALK ABOUT OR FALL IN U.K. ONLY SIX PER CENT THAT WILL BE LARGER THAN THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES SO FIRST OF ALL THEY TAKE THE VERY VERY WORST CASE YOU CAN DO BUT IT'S ALSO WORTH BEARING IN MIND WHAT THEY DON'T DO IS TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WHEN BRITAIN LEFT THE R. M. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN ACTUALLY INSTEAD OF IT BEING A SHOCK IT WAS A MASSIVE HUGE RISE IN INCOME AND PENSIONS DID
VERY WELL AS A RESULT OF THAT AND THAT IS YOUR PREDICTION IN MY VIEW IS YOU HAVE TO RECOGNISE THAT MOST OF THESE FORECASTS ARE TO BE FORECAST LA PAZ INVARIABLY GO WRONG MY VIEWERS THERE'S EVERY CHANCE THAT IN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION JUST AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER ARGUMENT THAT ACTUALLY DO BETTER OFF SO THE POINT DAD SAYS FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO DE SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT OTHER SIDE THE UPSIDE CASE OF LEAVING WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY INCREASE RESOURCES TO PENSIONS
WHEN I WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT'S OUTRAGEOUS I THINK IN A SENSE FOR THEM TO COME OUT AND REALLY TRY AND SCARE PENSIONERS IN THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE THEY GO WHEN THEY KNOW FULL WELL THAT PENSION SAVINGS I'VE DONE OVER A LONGER PERIOD AND AS ANY PENSIONS ADVISOR WILL TELL YOU THEY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT PENSION SAVING SURVIVE YEAH BUT ARE COMING THE BRITISH IF THE BRITISH ECONOMY WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED
BY A DECISION ANY IMAGINE THEN IT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE WIDER ECONOMY AND ON THERE IS NOT A SHORT DROP THEIR ASSUMPTION IS HUGE AMOUNTS OF TIME AHEAD YOU'D HAVE THE WORST WORST PERIOD WORSE THAN IT WAS IN THE DEPRESSION WORSEN YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE HE'S COMING DOWN THE TRACK THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENT BUT THE TWO OTHER THINGS DOESN'T A REALLY IMPORTANT WHICH AGAIN THEY FAILED TO PUT IN THERE ARE TWO BIG THREATS OF REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH ARE COMING DOWN THE TRACK AS ONE ON PENSIONS ON PENSIONS SOLVENCY DIRECTIVE
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THEIR PLANS ON SOLVENCY WILL ACTUALLY COST U.K. PENSIONS FOUR HUNDRED BILLION AND THE POINT ABOUT THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT'S AS WELL YOU KNOW THAT STOPPED NO IT HASN'T THEY POSTPONE THAT DIRECTIVE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHILE THEY SAID WE WOULD TAKE FURTHER CONSIDERATION BEFORE BRINGING IT FORWARD THEY SAY WE'RE STILL IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND THE WHOLE POINT OF BEING ABLE TO INFLUENCE THOSE THINGS AND ON PENSIONS THEY SAY PART OF THE THREAT THEY DID SAY IT WAS A THREAT A FEW YEARS AGO PART OF THE THREAT HAS BEEN DEALT WITH AND THE REST OF IT CAMP
NO BECAUSE THE SOLVENCY DIRECTIVE WILL COME BACK AGAIN THAT'S ALMOST IS CERTAIN AND THAT WILL COST BRITISH
PENSIONERS A HUGE SUM OF MONEY IN THE SECOND THING WHICH IS COMING AS EVEN IN A SENSE BIGGER HARMONISATION DIRECTIVE WHICH WILL REALLY DAMAGE AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE STEVE WEBB BEFORE REFERRED TO THIS AS THE MOST DAMAGING AND RECKLESS PROPOSAL IT'S POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE BOTH OF THOSE COULD COST PENSIONERS DRAMATIC SUMS OF MONEY AFTER ALL FIFTY PER CENT OF THE ASSETS OF PENSION FUNDS ARE HELD HERE IN THE U.K. AND THEY ONLY EXPORT
TWELVE POINT TWO PER CENT OF PENSIONS AND INSURANCE TO THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN IN SO BIG THREAT AND THE BIG POINT ABOUT THIS IS THIS WILL BE DONE UNDER QUALIFIED MAJORITY VOTING WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS WE GO TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND YOU ARE ONLY ONE NATION ALONE EVEN IF YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF YOU CANNOT STOP THIS THAT MEANS THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE PENSIONS IS TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE THEN IT WON'T APPLY TO THE U.K. AND THE U.K. WILL DO WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING ALL ALONG WHICH IS EXPORTED AROUND THE WORLD AND MAKING SHORT OWN PENSIONS ARE ACTUALLY PROTECTED AND THAT'S THE POINT THE GOVERNMENT'S FAILED TO RECOGNISE IN ALL OF THIS YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS WAS BROUGHT OUT JUST BEFORE THE PURDAH ROSE YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING I THEY'VE BROKEN THOSE RUNS THEY'VE JUST BEEN QUITE TOUGH ABOUT HIM FORCING AND THE NAME THEY'VE DONE WHAT THEY THINK THEY CAN RIDE UP TO THE MOMENT THAT THE RULES COME IN THAT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE ISN'T WELL POLITICS AS I HEARD FROM A
NAMED B.B.C. C. ONE WHEN I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THIS THEY REFERRED TO THIS SAYS THEY REHASH OF A BIT OF OLD INFORMATION PUT THROUGH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MEAT GRINDER AT THE LAST GOVERNMENT STALLED AT THE LAST MOST TO DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE LAST MOMENT AT THE LAST MOMENT TO TRY AND GET A STORY AND I WONDER WHETHER OUR ANYONE LISTEN TO THIS WOULD RECOGNISE ONE OF THE BIG STORIES LIKE YESTERDAY AND RUNNING IN TODAY HAS BEEN AT THE SECOND WORST IMMIGRATION STATISTICS COMING OUT
THE E. YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY TRYING TO GET THE SITE THEY MAKE NO I MAKE NO ALLEGATIONS ABOUT MY GOVERNMENT OTHER THAN IT SEEMS TO ME A GREAT COALITION OF INTEREST THAT SUDDENLY WITH A TERRIBLE STORY ABOUT BEING A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU HAVE MASSIVE MIGRATION COMING IN PUSHING SALARIES FOR THE LOWEST PAID DOWN
HUGE MIGRATION FROM WITHIN THE E.U. WHICH WE CAN'T CONTROL THE ONLY WAY TO CONTROL MIGRATION OF COURSE IS TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU KNOW DAVID CAMERON WON'T WORK THAN MANY A LONG YEAR STEVE HELP SAYING THE OTHER DAY ACTUALLY DAVID CAMERON HE'S NOT AT HEART
SOMEONE WANTS TO SAY AND THE OPINION IT WASN'T PRIME MINISTER HAD A CAMPAIGNER TO GET OUT HE INCIDENTALLY I SHOULD SAY THE PRIME MINISTER JUST DENIED THAT IT HAD NEWS CONFERENCE THAT IS HOLDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD THAT G. SEVEN BUT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT STEVE HILTON SAID YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT
WELL I I I'M NOT AS I WAS NEVER AS CLOSE TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF STEVE HILTON HAS BEEN THEY WERE VERY VERY CLOSE FRIENDS AND YOU KNOW WHAT HIS POLITICAL INSTINCTS ARE DO YOU THINK IF HE WASN'T PRIME MINISTER HE MIGHT BE ON YOUR SIDE I DON'T HAVE A WINDOW INTO THE PRIME MINISTER'S SOUL AND I HAVE ALWAYS MADE IT A A POSITION OF MINE WHICH IS NEVER TO GAZE INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S MOTIVATIONS I ONLY DEAL WITH WHAT THEIR ACTIONS ARE THE ACTION I SEE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AT THE MOMENT MY GOVERNMENT PRIME MINISTER IS AN ALL OUT
ATTEMPT TO TRY AND GET THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO FEAR THE FUTURE AND TO WORRY SO MUCH THAT THEY WOULD NOT VOTE TO LEAVE I HAVE TO DO THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS THE GREAT BRITISH ECONOMY MADE THE MOST WONDERFUL PEOPLE ON THE EARTH WHO ARE THE MOST ENTREPRENEURIAL AND BRILLIANT
I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN STAND IN THEIR WAY AND IF WE ARE FREE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS GREAT COUNTRY WILL THRIVE AND PROSPER O.K. THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF COURSE HIMSELF BEFORE HE DECIDED A CAMPAIGN TO STAY IN IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WERE TALKING TO THE PENSIONS MINISTER LADY PORTMAN TEN PAST EIGHT TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN
OH JUST WHAT WOULD THE U.K. ECONOMY DO WITHOUT THE BANK OF MUM AND DAD AND INDEED THE HOUSE OF MUM AND DAD ROB YEUNG HAS YES WE'VE KNOWN FOR A WHILE ABOUT THE TREND OF GROWN UP CHILDREN WHO ARE STILL LIVING WITH THEIR PARENTS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF PROPERTY WELL THE INSURANCE GIANT AVIVA SAYS THERE ARE ALMOST THREE MILLION SUCH ADULTS IN THEIR TWENTIES AND EARLY THIRTIES LIVING WITH THEIR PARENTS AND THAT FORECASTS THAT NUMBER WILL RISE BY ANOTHER ONE MILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE WE CAN TALK TO SIMON ALSOP OF EVA'S CHIEF UNDERWRITING OFFERS A GOOD MORNING
HELLO WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY TALKING ABOUT SINGLE GROWN UP CHILDREN HERE BUT AN INCREASE IN MARRIED COUPLES WHO ARE STILL LIVING WITH ONE SET OF PARENTS BUT THAT'S RIGHT WHAT WE FOUND WE FOUND FOUR HOUSES OR HOMES WHERE THERE WERE CHILDREN THEIR PARENTS BUT ALSO WE SAW MOTTY FAMILY IN THAT SO THAT WOULD BE A MARRIED COUPLE WITH LIVING WITH THEIR MUM AND DAD MUM AND MARRIED AND DAD
RIGHT AND ON WHAT BASIS DO YOU MAKE THE FORECAST THAT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH THEIR PARENTS IS TO SAW YES WE SURVEYED AT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE AND WE'VE LOOKED AT THE TRENDS OVER TIME THE THE PREPPED THE PRESSURES ON THOSE FAMILIES
AND THIS IS ALL TO DO WITH RISING HOUSE PRICES SO WHAT WE FOUND IS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT THEIR HOUSE PRICES HAVE RISEN BY FIFTY TWO PERCENT WHEREAS AVERAGE SALARIES HAVE RISEN BY FOURTEEN PERCENT OF COURSE MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU FORCED TO STAY AT HOME IN ORDER TO SAVE FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP
BUT THE REALLY SURPRISING THING ROB WAS WHEN WE LOOKED AT THOSE PEOPLE AND SPOKE TO ABOUT LIVING IN MULTI GENERATIONAL HOMES WE WERE VERY SURPRISED TO FIND THAT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE
FOUND THAT SITUATION TO BE ACTUALLY ADVANCE AT ADVANTAGEOUS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF SAVINGS BECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE HAVING CONSTANT COMPANY JOIN THE DAY ET-CETERA TO THE BENEFITS MAY WELL OUTWEIGH SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES THAT PRESUMABLY IT IS FAR FROM THEIR IDEAL SITUATION
I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SO I'D SAY WE WERE WE WERE VERY SURPRISED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WERE POSITIVE ABOUT IT BUT WHAT WE ALSO FOUND IS THAT FOR MANY MANY YOUNG PEOPLE
THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP REMAINS A GOAL BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT'S NOW A LONG TERM GOAL WAS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHORT TERM GOAL IN THE PAST RIGHT BUT BUT AGAIN PEOPLE ACCEPTING THAT THAT'S THE CASE PEOPLE ACCEPTING THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO SAY FOR LONGER IN TO MEET THAT DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP AND WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF ALL OF THIS FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY DO YOU THINK
I THINK THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE THIS INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING IN HOUSES
WE'RE GOING TO SAY A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUING TO PUSH INTO SAVINGS TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THEY CAN GET HOME OWNERSHIP RATHER THAN WHAT WE SEE ON THE CONTINENT WHERE PEOPLE IN THE SITUATION WITH TYPICALLY TRUE SIR GO AND RENT O.K. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHIEF UNDERWRITING OFFICER AT HAVE YOU

IT'S EMERGED THAT THE NUMBER OF FINGERPRINTS AND D.N.A. RECORDS OF TERRORISM SUSPECTS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHICH WERE ACCIDENTALLY DELETED IS MUCH GREATER THAN FIRST REVEALED EIGHT HUNDRED TEN PROFILES WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR DATABASE BEFORE NATIONAL SECURITY CHECKS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT THAT'S ALMOST TWICE THE FIGURE ADMITTED IN MARCH THE HOME OFFICE SAID POLICE WOULD KEEP THE MATTER UNDER CLOSE REVIEW
BARACK OBAMA IS DUE TO ARRIVE SHORTLY AND HIROSHIMA BECOMING THE FIRST U.S. PRESIDENT TO VISIT THE CITY HE SAID THERE WILL BE NO APOLOGY FOR THE UNITED STATES DROPPING OF THE ATOM BOMB ON HIROSHIMA IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE INSTEAD HE'LL HONOUR ALL THOSE WHO WERE LOST IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR
THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT IF YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH A CRIMINAL TRIAL IN MANCHESTER THERE IS JUST A TWENTY PERCENT CHANCE THAT IT WILL START A SCHEDULED TWENTY PER CENT ONE OF THE FACTS REVEALED BY THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE THIS MORNING IN A REPORT THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES
IS CLOSE TO BREAKING POINT WITNESSES IN TRIAL SAID EXPERIENCES AWFUL THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO DO IT AGAIN THAT LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE OFFENCE AND THE TRIAL IS WAY TOO LONG IN MANY CASES MEG HILLIER IS THE LABOUR M.P. WHO CHAIRS THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE AND HIS HAIR AND JEFF WE LEANT ON THE LINE AS A BARRISTER AT KENWORTHY'S CHAMBERS JOINS US FROM MYSELF SOFA STUDENT BODY TO BOTH MORNING MORNING MEG HILLIER FIRST WILL WHAT ACTUALLY IS GOING WRONG
WELL THERE'VE BEEN A SERIES OF CUTS ABOUT TWENTY SIX PERCENT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND THAT HAS REALLY STRETCH THE SYSTEM SO THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH JUDGES THAT MEANS NOT ENOUGH SITTING DAYS AND THERE'S A REAL SHORTAGE OF C.P.S. LAWYERS SO VERY OFTEN CASES GET TO COURT AND THE C.P.S. HAVEN'T ACTUALLY EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE CASE MISSUS PRETTY RAW DEAL FURTHER WITNESSES MANY OF WHOM OF COURSE ARE VICTIMS AS WELL AND THE IMPACT ON THEM IS IS A REAL ONE MINUTE IT'S THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU TAKE WHEN YOU GET TO CALL BUT IT'S ALSO YOU'RE SAYING ARE BEING MESSED AROUND AND ENDLESSLY
WAITING AROUND TO DO IT IN WHAT WEEKS MONTHS ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THE LENGTH OF TIME THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME FROM SOMETHING GOING FOR THE MAGISTRATE COURTS TO ADD TO THE CORE CROWN COURT HAS RISEN FROM NINETY NINE DAYS THREE YEARS AGO TO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THAT'S AN AVERAGE BUT A STAGGERING FIGURES ABOUT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET TO IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IT'S OVER FOUR HUNDRED DAY SUFFERER WITNESS ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE A VICTIM AS WELL BUT BUT FOR BOTH IT'S A LONG DRAWN OUT
SITUATION VERY DISTRESSING VERY OFTEN AND THEN WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT QUITE OFTEN JUST LEFT HANGING AROUND AND OFTEN THE CASE AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED FROM THAT FIGURE FROM MANCHESTER ALONE BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY DOESN'T ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE ON THE DAY JEFF WILLIAMS DO YOU RECOGNISE THAT PICTURE I DO YES IT'S A TRUE REFLECTION
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT AND PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SQUARELY IDENTIFIED AS A LACK OF RESOURCES AS MICK SAID THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS HAD A REDUCTION I THINK SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THOUSAND ELEVEN OR TWENTY SIX PER CENT YOU CAN'T MAKE CUTS LIKE THAT WITHOUT SEEING FRONT LINE CONSEQUENCES AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING DAY IN DAY OUT
ARE WE USING THE QUARTZ THAT WE HAVE AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE AND I'M THINKING OF JUDGES BARRISTERS EVERYONE ELSE AS WELL I WILL I'LL BE USING THEM OFFICIALLY
THERE'S DEFINITE SCOPE FOR FOR A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE PART OF THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH SITTING DAYS FOR EXAMPLE FOUR JUDGES
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU GET AN EVEN BIGGER BACKLOG OF CASES I THINK THE SITTING DAYS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY ALLOCATED BY THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE WERE DETERMINED ON THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND THEN THERE WAS AN UPSURGE IN CASES SO ONE YEAR THERE WAS EIGHTY THOUSAND CASES THE NECKS THERE'S NINETY SIX THOUSAND
AND ONLY ENOUGH SITTING DAYS IN EFFECT TO DEAL WITH EIGHTY THOUSAND SAID THE BACKLOG INCREASE COS THAT'S THE POINT THE GOVERNMENT MAKES MAKE KENYA IS ACTUALLY THERE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE SYSTEM THEY KNOW IT NEEDS REFORM THEY WANT TO DELIVER WHAT THEY CALL A SWIFTER MORE CERTAIN JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THERE ARE EFFICIENT SAYS THAT THEY ARE PURSUING DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS HAS AT LEAST GOT THE RIGHT INTENTIONS ABSOLUTELY WE WELCOME THAT THEY'RE AT THE DIRECTION OF TRAVELS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION LET'S BE CLEAR THERE ARE FISH AND SEASON NOW
THAT COULD BE TAKING PLACE THAT DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR YEARS FOR EXAMPLE IN BIRMINGHAM POLICE OFFICERS CAN MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO MEET A JUDGE TO GET A WARRANT THEY DON'T HAVE TO HANG AROUND COURT ALL NOW IF THEY CAN DO THAT THERE WHY NOT THEY LEARNING THAT LESSON ACROSS THE PIECE AND THERE ARE LITTLE BITS AND PIECES LIKE THAT BUT ULTIMATELY AS GEOFF SAYS IN AIR FROM MANCHESTER THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM ABOUT RESOURCES IN THE SYSTEM AND OF COURSE THE SIXTEEN PERCENT GOING TO COME OUT OF THE SISTER THE MONEY MONEY CUTS CAN BE COMING IN THE NEXT
BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY AS WELL GOVERNMENT SAYS THEY'RE BACKING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH OVER TWO BILLION POUNDS OF INVESTMENT IS THAT IS THAT A SEPARATE AMOUNT OF MONEY DO YOU RECOGNISE THAT THAT AMOUNT BUT WE KNOW THAT IT COSTS GOVERNMENT ABOUT TWO BILLION POUNDS A YEAR TO RUN THE SYSTEM AS IT IS I'M NOT I DON'T RECOGNISE HER FIGURE I CAN'T HAVE I'VE ONLY JUST HEARD THAT THIS MORNING BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE PUTTING EFFORT IN AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A TEMP TO DIGITISE THE CASE RECORDS AND SO ON THESE THINGS WILL HELP WE THINK THEY WERE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE THE MONEY TO DELIVER IT BECAUSE SHE STILL HAD TO HAVE THE LAWYERS
AND THE JUDGES AND THEY HAVE TO BE PAID AND I THINK WHEN PEOPLE HEAR GEOFF WHELAN PEOPLE IDIOTS ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FENCE IN THEY'RE SAYING WE NEED MORE MONEY SPENT THEY WILL BE SUSPICIOUS THAT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT THAT THERE ARE EFFICIENCIES THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED NOW INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COURT SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY WOULD GO QUITE A LONG WAY TO SOLVING OCTOPUS THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT EVER COULD JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE
AN ISSUE IN MANY COURTS THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH IS SOMETHING CALLED FLOATING TRIALS NOW THAT'S THAT'S MOSTLY WHERE A DEFENDANT IS ON BAIL
AND THE COURT LISTS TRIAL ARE SOMETIMES THAT THE COURT CAN LIST SOMETHING LIKE FIVE OR SIX TRIALS IN A DAY AND HAVE MAYBE TWO QUARTS RUNNING AND HOPE THAT THE DEFENDANT WILL PLEAD GUILTY OR SOMETHING ELSE WILL HAPPEN WITH THE CASE WHICH MEANS IT GETS RESOLVED SOMETIMES THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND SIX TRIALS THEN GET ADJOURNED OFF INTO THE ETHER AND SIX LOTS OF WITNESSES HAVE COME TO COURT AND THEY ARE DISAPPOINTED BUT PSYCHOLOGICALLY PREPARED THEMSELVES TO GIVE EVIDENCE
AND THEY HAVE TO BE TOLD THEM SORRY WE'RE NOT GOING AHEAD TODAY WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD SIX MONTHS DOWN THE LINE BUT THAT THAT'S THE WRITER'S NAME IN THE FACT IS IF YOU HAVE DID IT JUSTICE AND EFFICIENCY DON'T NECESSARILY GO TOGETHER THEN THEIR MUM PERHAPS WE JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT WELL NO BECAUSE THIS COULD BE SOLVED IF YOU HAVE FIVE TRIALS LISTED MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO RUN FIVE TRIALS NOT ON THE BASIS OF FINGERS CROSSED LET'S HOPE SOMEBODY PLEADS GUILTY BUT THERE'S A VERY BIG WIDE FEET REGIONAL VARIATION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF TRIALS THEY GET TO THE POINT
ON TRIAL DAY HAVE COLLAPSING IF YOU COOK IT WITH SOME EARLY WARNING SIGNS THAT CAN BE PREDICTED BETTER AND YOU CAN SEE THAT HAPPENS IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT OTHERS THAT WHAT RICO'S SHOCKED US THAT THERE'S GOOD THINGS GOING ON AND NOT ENOUGH LEARNING
IN THE MEANTIME WHILE THE GOVERNMENT GOES FOR ITS REFORMS BUT LET'S BE CLEAR MICHAEL COME IN A FAIRLY NEW SECRETARY OF STATE TO DELIVER CHANGES AND IT WAS CHRIS GRAYLING WAS AND THE CONSERVATIVE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS MANY THERE GO LEFT REFORMS ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE WASN'T WORKING RIGHT MICHAELA AND JEFF WILL AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW NINETY MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE RISER NET MIGRATION REVEALED YESTERDAY IS STIRRED THE LEADER WRITERS AHEAD OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM EXPRESSES THE IDEA BRITAIN CAN BRING DAMP IMMIGRATION WHILE STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS A FANTASY AND GETTING OUT OF THE E.U. HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THE DAILY MIRROR HIGHLIGHTS DAVID CAMERON'S FAILED PROMISE TO REDUCED NET MIGRATION TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS BUT SAYS THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF MIGRANTS WORK AND CONTRIBUTE FAR MORE IN TAXES THAN THEY RECEIVE IN BENEFITS OR COST THE N.H.S.
THE TIMES ARGUES THAT IN A DIFFERENT POLITICAL CRIME AT THE RIGHT AND IMMIGRATION WOULD BE REGARDED AS A POSITIVE SIGN BECAUSE IT'S A TESTAMENT TO ECONOMIC HEALTH IT AS THERE'S NO BETTER ANTIDOTE IMMIGRATION THAN RECESSION AND ECONOMIC DECLINE FINANCIAL TIMES COMPARES THE FUNDRAISING EFFORTS IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND FINDS THE LEAVE SUPPORTERS HAVING DEEPER POCKETS IT SAYS DATA FROM THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION SHOWS LEAVE GROUPS OF FOUR MILLION
BETWEEN APRIL THE TWENTY SECOND AND MAY THE TWELFTH REMAIN CAMPAIGNS RECEIVED ONE POINT SIX MILLION POUNDS THE LARGEST A NATION WAS FROM BIRMINGHAM BASED INTERNATIONAL MOTORS FOR EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO VOTE LEAVE SEVERAL PAPERS HIGHLIGHT LEAKED MESSAGES FROM JUNIOR DOCTORS INVOLVED IN THE CONTRACT DISPUTE WITH THE GOVERNMENT THE SUN SAYS THEY REVEAL HOW DOCTORS INSISTED THE ROW WAS OVER PATIENT CARE WHEN PAY WAS THE ONLY REAL RED LINE
THE DAILY MAIL'S ACCOUNT SAYS THAT SCENE IN UNION FIGURES PLANNED TO TIE THE GOVERNMENT IN NOT FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS A DEAL REACH FOR THE GOVERNMENT STILL NEED TO BE APPROVED BY THEM MEMBERS A B.M.A. SPOKESMAN TELLS A PAPER THAT PRIVATE DISCUSSION SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR THE AGREED STRATEGY OF THE B.M.A. DOCTORS COMMIT THE DAILY MIRROR LEAVES WITH A STORY ABOUT A KILLER AT SAYS WAS CAUGHT BY A CLAIRVOYANT REPORTS AT THE MAN CONFESSED BEEN HAVING COMMITTED A MURDER WHEN HE VISITED A PSYCHIC AFTER SERIES OR TAROT CARDS WERE TURNED OVER SUGGESTING SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
SOMETHING BAD HAD HAPPENED JANE BRADEN FROM SUSSEX TELLS THE PAPER HOW SHE CALLED NINE NINE NINE THE POLICE INITIALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A HOAX SHE KEPT THE MAN TALKING FOR AN HOUR FIFTY YEAR OLD START RANDALL HANSON WAS JAILED LAST WEEK FOR A MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN YEARS THE GUARDIAN IS AMONG THOSE TO FEATURE THE SAD CASE ON AMERICAN HIGH HE BECAME LOST ON THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL GERALDINE LAA GET IT WAS SIXTY SIX WROTE TEXTS CALLING FOR HELP BUT SHE HAD NO PHONE SIGNAL
THE FINAL ENTRY IN HER DIARY SUGGESTS SHE WAS ALIVE FOR A MONTH AFTER SHE DISAPPEARED SHE ASKED THAT WHOEVER FOUND HER BODY SHE CALLED HER HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER SHE WROTE IT WILL BE THE GREATEST KINDNESS THAN FOR THEM TO KNOW THAT I AM DEAD NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS FROM NOW
IT WAS TWO YEARS BEFORE HER BODY AND PERSONAL ITEMS WERE FOUND IN A MAKESHIFT TENT BY A FORESTER
AND THE SPREAD OF THE ESSEX ACCENT AS CHARTED BY THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND LOOKS AT A STUDY FROM CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY WHICH FOUND WORDS AND SPEECH PATTERNS FROM LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST OF KILLED OFF OTHER REGIONAL ACCENTS ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS THE ESSEX ISM OF SAYING FREE INSTEAD OF THREE HAD SPREAD FROM TWO PER CENT OF THE POPULATION IN NINETEEN FIFTY TO FIFTEEN PER CENT TODAY BUT THE LONG ARE AS HARMED ONCE PRONOUNCED BY THE ENTIRE SOUTH WEST HAS ALMOST DIED OUT THAT'S
ANYWAY AGAINST BATH PLAYED BRISTOL NEXT YEAR IN THE RUBBER STUDY PUTS THE FINDINGS DOWN PEOPLE SPREADING BLUNDER AND THE INFLUENCE OF TELEVISION
IT'S NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT HOW DOES THE E.U. REFERENDUM LOOK FROM NORTHERN IRELAND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING THIS MORNING IN THE LATEST OF OUR REPORTS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE U.K. AHEAD OF THE VOTE WE HEARD FROM HER EARLIER LET'S GO BACK AGAIN NOW TO MICHELLE WHO IS THERE HELLO AGAIN MICHELLE
IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU CAN SAY I HAVE ONE FOOT IN ONE COUNTRY AND THE OTHER IN A SECOND BUT I AM STANDING THIS MORNING RIGHT ON THE BORDER OF THE U.K. AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND TRAFFIC YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR NOW AND THEN IS ON THE MAIN ROAD BETWEEN LONDONDERRY IN NORTH WEST ULSTER AND COUNTY DONEGAL
IT'S NOT A BORDER THAT'S VERY NOTICEABLE YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED TO SPOT WHERE THE ROAD SIGN START TO APPEAR IN IRISH AS WELL AS ENGLISH THE SPEED LIMIT IS IN KILOMETRES RATHER THAN MILES PER HOUR AND THE PETREL SUDDENLY GETS CHEAPER
BUT THE E.U. REFERENDUM IS RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS BORDER MIGHT OPERATE IN THE FUTURE
QUESTIONS COLOURED BY DIFFICULT MEMORIES OF THE PAST
ON THE SITE OF A FORMER BRITISH ARMY BORDER CHECKPOINT
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY SUBSTANTIAL MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND HISTORIAN DOCTOR BILLY KELLY LIVED IN THIS AREA THROUGH THERE
THEY KIDNAPPED THE MAN WHO WORKS THE RUBBISH
TALL DUNDEE DAVE VAN AND DETECT
OVER UNDER CHECKPOINT YOU GET MIDDLE AT THE VIC WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER HER PASSING THROUGH THIS
IT'S NEVER SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE BECAUSE IF THERE IS EVEN A SLAYER SAYING WRONG WE COULD BE HERE FOREVER
WITH THE REFERENDUM COMING THE BORDER IS ONCE AGAIN A TALKING POINT FOR LOCAL PEOPLE
MARCO IT'S ME I'VE WE STARTED AT TWENTY YEARS LATER TO ME
THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS I'VE COME ON HAVE TAKEN OVER IT'S GOING FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH SO ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE REFERENDUM AND HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT
WORRIED I AM NOT TOO SURE WE'VE ALWAYS GONNAE AFFECT THINGS AT THE MOMENT OBVIOUSLY WE DID
CROSS BORDER TRADE KEVIN NOW LIVES IN THE REPUBLIC WHERE PROPERTY IS CHEAPER
AND FORTH SEVERAL TIMES A DAY HE RELIES ON HIS
HE'S IRISH CUSTOMERS DOING THE SAME OF THE REFERENDUM WAS
WHAT WAS HE GOING TO BE CHECKPOINTS AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE CUSTOMS THEY'RE CONSTANTLY HAVE US EVEN A FIVER CAN WHEN I STOP AT A CLIPPER
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE BORDER JUST THAT THEY ARE THEY SAY LOVE WHEREVER THEY WERE
MY MOTHER IS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PASSING THE THOSE BOB I'VE GOT THE STAGE WHERE
A FIVE FIVE YEAR OLAF AGE THERE AND I HAVE AND I ARE AT THE AT THE CHECKPOINT AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
JUST ACROSS ON THE IRISH SIDE IS ANOTHER FAMILY BUSINESS CARRIES A RESTAURANT RUN BY DONAL DOHERTY EVERYTHING HERE HAS CHANGED WITH TWO THINGS PIECE HAS GOT RID OF ALL THE ARMY AND CHECKPOINTS AND EVERYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED FOR EUROPE AND THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
TAKING CUSTOMS POSTS OFF THE ROADS AND LITERALLY WE CAN SEE IN THIS VILLAGE WHERE THIS VILLAGE WAS A STOP VILLAGE BECAUSE CUSTOMS MADE YOU STOP NO IT'S JUST A BUSINESS TO TRADE IN THE
PEOPLE HERE THINK IN TWO CURRENCIES MAKING DAILY
ABOUT WHAT TO BUY WHERE IN STERLING OR EURO
MANY SEE THEMSELVES AS PART OF A SINGLE CROSS BOARDING ECONOMY
BUT YOU DON'T THE REFERENDUM MEANS IT'S AN UNCERTAIN
THIS AIN'T HERE FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE HOLDING OFF ON AN INVESTMENT ON THIS SIDE I HAVE INVESTMENT RECITE ON TO WORSHIP IT BREAKS
THERE IS NOTHING GOOD ABOUT BREAKS IT FOR ANY
BUT NORTHERN IRELAND'S DOMINANT POLITICAL FORCE THE D.U.P. HAS COME OUT IN FAVOUR OF BRICKS IT LEE REYNOLDS IS THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WITH THE BORDER WOULD OPERATE ESSENTIALLY HAZARD OPERATES NOW
WE'VE HAD A COMMON TRAVEL AREA BETWEEN THE KINGDOM AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND WITH LAMB BORDER WE'VE HAD OPEN FRILLY FOR TRAVEL
THE ARRANGEMENTS PREDATED THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY'RE ALREADY RECOGNISED IN SADIE YOU TRADITIONALLY USE
IT WOULD BE IN OUR INTERESTS IRELAND'S INTERESTS AND THE INTERESTS FOR THOSE TO CARRY ON AFTERWARDS BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE THAN THE BORDER BETWEEN THE U.K. AND IRELAND IN THE EVENT OF BRICKS IT IT WOULD BE THE U.K.'S ONLY LAND BORDER WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE YOU SAYING IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY UNCHANGED PEOPLE WOULD
CROSS IT WITH EXACTLY THE SAME IS THAT THEY DO TODAY
YES WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS AND WE WERE CONVINCED OF THE COMMON TRAVEL AREA CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST AND THE PEOPLE'S LIVES CAN CARRY ON NORMALLY THAT PEOPLE BE ABLE TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE BORDER AND STRAIGHT ACROSS
BACK ON THE ROAD BETWEEN DERRY AND UNEQUAL THE TRAFFIC IS FLOWING FREELY FROM ONE COUNTRY INTO A NOVEL
BUT BRICKS IT WOULD TURN THIS BORDER INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EXTERNAL FRONTIER IN THAT EVENT THERE WOULD BE MORE THAN TRADE TO CONSIDER
DOCTOR EAMON OH KYRA TEACHES HISTORY AND IRISH LANGUAGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER THERE ARE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS WICKED YOU KNOW MONEY LAUNDERING WIT DOGS
HUMAN TRAFFIC IN A TETRA AND CHURCHILL FAMOUSLY TALKED ABOUT THE A. AND COURTIN DOORKNOB OLLIE OVER EUROPE AND NOW YOU'RE IN COURT AND HAS JUST GONE UP ALONG THE HUNGARIAN BOARD THEM IN THE SLOVENIAN
THE STEAMY SHOT THE RING WENT VERY QUICKLY ALONG THE FRONTIER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A FRONTIER AS WELL
I WAS IN IRELAND NORTH AND SOUTH AND WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM HER LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME TIME NOW IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER HERE IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS RABBI LORD SACKS FOR MORNING GOOD MORNING MY EYE WAS CAUGHT BY TWO NEWS ITEMS IN CLOSE SUCCESSION
THE FIRST WAS ABOUT A LAW CASE BEING TAKEN OUT IN THE UNITED STATES AGAINST THE MAKERS OF THOSE FIT FITNESS TRACKERS YOU WEAR ON YOUR WRIST THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU HOW MANY STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN TODAY WHAT YOUR HEART RAGES AND HOW FAR YOU STILL ARE FROM LOSING ALL THAT WEIGHT YOU SAID YOU'D LOSE IT'S CLAIMED THAT SOME OF THEM ARE NOT AS ACCURATE AS THEY MIGHT BE AND THAT'S GOING TO BE FOUGHT OUT IN COURT
THE OTHER ITEM WAS ABOUT A GADGET THAT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE HER FIT THIS TRACKER EXCEPT THAT IT MONITORS YOUR BANK BALANCE IT GIVES YOU A WARNING WHEN YOU'RE SPENDING TOO MUCH AND AN ELECTRIC SHOCK WHEN YOU GO INTO OVERDRAFT OUCH
I CONFESS I'M NOT ENTIRELY IMPARTIAL ON THE SUBJECT BECAUSE A FEW MONTHS AGO I BOUGHT A FITNESS TRACKER YOU SEE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I SPEND DAY AFTER DAY SITTING AT A DESK AND AS THE MODERN MANTRA GOES SITTING IS THE NEW SMOKING IT'S BAD FOR YOU SO I DON'T MIND WHETHER THE THING IS TOTALLY ACCURATE I JUST LIKE THE FACT THAT IT GIVES ME A BAD CONSCIENCE WHEN I HAVEN'T EXERCISED ENOUGH
SO I FIND MYSELF WALKING A LOT MORE THESE DAYS WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL AS WELL AS THE BODY BECAUSE WHEN YOU WALK YOU HAVE TIME TO ENJOY THE VIEW
AS FOR THE SPENDING TRACKER IT TOO SOUNDS AS IF IT CAN GIVE YOU A BAD CONSCIENCE TO BALANCE THE DOPAMINE RUSH YOU SOMETIMES GET WHEN YOU SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING YOU DON'T NEED FOR THE SAKE OF HER HAPPINESS THAT WON'T LAST
BUT WHAT REALLY SURPRISED ME IS THE SUDDEN REALISATION THAT THESE ULTRA NEW DEVICES ARE SIMILAR TO SOMETHING JEWISH MEN HAVE BEEN WEARING FOR THREE THOUSAND YEARS WE CALL MA'AM
TO FILM HIM FALACH THERESE LEATHER STRAPS WITH BOXES CONTAINING BIBLICAL VERSES THAT WE WEAR AS ARMBANDS AND HEADBANDS WHEN WE PRAY
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY STOP US DOING WRONG BUT THEY DO GIVE US A BAD CONSCIENCE ABOUT IT THEY REMIND US OF WHAT IN THE RUSSIAN PIECE OF EVERY DAY WE CAN FORGET
HOW MUCH WE HAVE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR HOW MUCH OTHER PEOPLE NEED OUR LOVE AND HOW EVEN IF NO ONE ELSE'S LOOKING WRONG HE'S STILL WRONG SO THANK YOU TO THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR REMINDING US OF SOMETHING VERY ANCIENT INDEED
PRAYER MEDITATION AND RITUAL OF FITNESS TRACKERS FOR THE SOUL
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE RABBI LORD SACKS THE TIME EIGHT MINUTES AWAY SCOTLAND'S FORMER FIRST MINISTER ALEX SALMOND DESCRIBED TO THE ABOLITION OF UNIVERSITY TUITION FEES AS HIS S.N.P. GOVERNMENT'S BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A FLAGSHIP POLICY THAT SET SCOTLAND ON A DIFFERENT PATH TO THE REST OF THE U.K.
BUT RESEARCH BY THE SUTTON TRUST AN EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY SHOWS THAT POOR STUDENTS IN SCOTLAND ARE LESS LIKELY TO GO TO UNIVERSITY THAN IF THEY WERE IN ENGLAND WHERE THERE ARE TUITION FEES
ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCHERS THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A CAP ON PLACES IN SCOTLAND AND THAT'S LED TO POORER STUDENTS BEING
EDGED OUT WELL WE'RE JOINED BY THE SCOTTISH EDUCATION MINISTER JOHN SWINNEY GOOD MORNING TO YOU YOUR MONEY NOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST SEARCH THAT SUGGESTED THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS POLICY DO YOU THINK IT IS TIME TO THINK AGAIN ABOUT FREE TUITION AND HAVE THE CAP ON NUMBERS
NO I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO I THINK IF WE WERE TO HAVE TUITION FEES IN SCOTLAND IT WOULD PROVIDE I THINK HER FATHER DISINCENTIVE ON PEOPLE FROM DEPRIVED AREAS ENTERING HIGHER EDUCATION AND PUT THE REPORT FEEL YOU RECKON RECORDS IS THE FACT THAT IT'S A GUP IN PARTICIPATION BETWEEN YOUNG PEOPLE FROM THE MOST AND THE LEAST DEPRIVED ADVANTAGE TEDIOUS IN THE COUNTRY
BUT IT RECOGNISES THAT THAT GAP HAS CLOSED MORE QUICKLY IN SCOTLAND AND ELSEWHERE SO THE MEASURES WE ARE TAKING A HAVING A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THIS ISSUE AND OF COURSE WE ARE COMMITTED TO TAKING FOR THEM IS JUST A BIT TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE ABOUT AND HOLD ON A SECOND BECAUSE WHAT THIS REPORT SHOWS IS THAT THE POOR IN SCOTLAND ARE FOUR TIMES LESS LIKELY TO GO TO UNIVERSITY THAN THE RICH IN ENGLAND IT'S TWO POINT FOUR TIMES LESS LIKELY AND IT ALSO SHOWS THAT NINETY PER CENT OF THE INCREASE
IN POORER STUDENTS IT IS THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO COLLEGES NOT TO UNIVERSITY BUT THAT'S A VERY THAT'S A VERY CLEAR ROUTE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE CAN TAKE IN SCOTLAND TO GET TO UNIVERSITIES TO DO THAT THROUGH A COLLEGE ROUTE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES ABOUT THIS REPORT THE REPORT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE VERY C. BECAUSE OF THE DEED TO THAT USES THE VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARTICULATE THROUGH COLLEGE TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY ENVIRONMENT AND TO SIR AND ALSO TO SECURE
HIGHER EDUCATION COURSES AT A FURTHER EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT SO DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS THE CASE DO YOU HAVE THE STATISTICS THAT SHOW THAT YES MORE POORER PEOPLE GOING TO COLLEGE OF EFFIE'S BUT THEY THEN GO ON TO THE HIGH CLASS TOP CLASS UNIVERSITY THAT'S ONE OF THE ROUTES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE TAKE YOUR FOR EXAMPLE IS IN THERE MAYBE SOME BUT WHAT I'M ASKING IS DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS MET THAT THERE ARE FIGURES THAT SHOW THAT THAT'S MAKING SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT WE SEE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND HAVE A HIGHER PARTICIPATION RATE IN
HIGHER EDUCATION THAN IN THE REST OF THE UNITED KINGDOM FIFTY FIVE PER CENT IN SCOTLAND COMPARED TO FORTY SEVEN PERCENT IN THE REST OF THE KIDS WHO HAVE A HIGHER PARTICIPATION RATE IN SCOTLAND THE CHALLENGE IS FOR US TO MAKE GREATER PROGRESS IN CLOSING THE AXIS GAP AND THAT'S FOR EXAMPLE WHY WE SET UP A COMMISSION ON WIDENING ACCESS INTO HIGHER EDUCATION IT WAS CHAIRED BY DIM WITH SILVER IT PRODUCED A LOT OF VERY GOOD AND STRONG RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF A COMMISSION ON WIDENING ACCESS TO DRIVE THIS PROCESS WITHIN THE SCOTTISH SYSTEM AND THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS UNFAIR DAMAGING AN UNSUSTAINABLE BUT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DETERMINED TO DO IS TO TACKLE THE ISSUES THAT UNDERPIN THIS AND IT'S NOT JUST ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE IT AFFECTS ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION WE'VE ACKNOWLEDGED MY CENTRAL PURPOSE AS THE NEW EDUCATION SECRETARY IN SCOTLAND TO TACKLE THE ATTAINMENT GAP WITHIN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN SCOTLAND
THAT THAT IS A NECESSITY FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IMPROVE ATTAINMENT WITHIN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN SCOTLAND THAT WE CLOSE THAT GAP BETWEEN THOSE FROM THE MOST ADVANTAGE DISADVANTAGE BUT GOES TO THE LEAST ADVANTAGED BUTLIN'S AND WE SHOULD CREATE ACCESS TO EDUCATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME FROM A DEPRIVATION WON'T YOU WILL KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME RESEARCH OUT AT THE END OF THE LONG LAST YEAR FROM
EDUCATION'S EXPERTS AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY WHICH SAID THAT YOUR POLICY OF PUTTING MONEY INTO UNIVERSITIES IS AT THE EXPENSE OF SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND SO YOU ARE EMBEDDING EXISTING INEQUALITIES BECAUSE THOSE WHO FROM POORER BACKGROUNDS YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO WELL AT SCHOOL AND AND BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INVESTMENT
DOPE CANNOT CATCH UP THEN DON'T GO ON TO UNIVERSITY WE HAVE A VERY STRONG INVESTMENT RICK UP TO IN THE SCHOOLS OF SCOTLAND WERE SPENDING A LOT OF THE ODD TO FIVE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR ON SCHOOL EDUCATION WITHIN SCOTLAND AND THE FOCUS THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO A POLICY FRAMEWORK THE PRIORITIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE FIRST MINISTER COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CLEARER ABOUT THIS ABOUT HER OBJECTIVE
IS TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN CLOSING THE ATTAINMENT GAP IN OUR SCHOOLS WITH A VIEW TO ELIMINATING THAT OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD THAT IS WHAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON AS A GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT EVERY POLICY YOU LADIES FOR A LONG TIME DO YOU ACCEPT THAT IT HASN'T WORKED
WHAT I CAN SEE IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DEPRIVED BACKGROUNDS GOING TO HIGHER EDUCATION IT'S UP BY TWENTY COLLEGE OF EFFIE'S NOT TO UNIVERSE BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT THAT'S WHAT I AWAY BEHIND ENGLAND DO YOU ACCEPT THAT IT IS NOT WORKING WHICH I DO IT'S ABOUT TWENTY NINE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE PERIOD SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THAT IS DISCERNIBLE PROGRESS DELIVERED TO PLEA TO ENSURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED IN SCOTLAND
JOHN SWINNEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND FOR THE PAPERS HERE WITH WEATHER
THANKS THAT'S A VERY GOOD MORNING TO SOUTH WEST ENGLAND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND AND WALES YES SUNNY SPELLS CERTAINLY BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY SHARP SHOWERS AROUND AT THE MOMENT I THINK THEY'LL TEND TO FADE TOWARDS LUNCHTIME SEMI ON INTO THE OFF IN THE SOUTH EAST WILL BE DRY WITH SUNSHINE WARM TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE IN THE LONDON AREA BUT THOSE SHOWERS WILL GET IDEAS ABOVE THEIR STATION FOR THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND WALES THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON ON INTO THE EVENING THUNDERSTORMS NO LESS AND SOME PRETTY TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS AS WELL
TEMPERATURES THOUGH WITH A BIT OF BRIGHTNESS COMING THROUGH BETWEEN THE SHOWERS CERTAINLY WELL ON INTO THE TEENS FOR THE REST OF ENGLAND A HAZY SUNSHINE I WATCH OUT FOR FOG IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO I THINK THEY'LL SOON QUIT THE SCENE AND THEN THERE WILL BE SOME SUNSHINE AROUND EXCEPT THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND AGAIN IN PLACES THE LOW CLOUD THE PLATE IS SO MUCH YESTERDAY STILL THERE AS A BOTHER FOR SUN AND IN FACT SOME EASTERN SHORES MAY SEE A RETURN OF LOW CLOUD AS THE AFTERNOON PROGRESSES AND THE BREEZES BRING THAT LOW CLOUD BACK IN FROM THE NORTH SEA

TO TILL THE EVENING ORGAN ENDLESS AT HOME YOU CAN TELL US IF YOU LIKE IT'S THE B.B.C. RADIO THEATRE DOWNSTAIRS IN THERE TODAY STUDIO BROADCASTING HOUSE
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF MAY GOOD MORNING THESE ARE THE HEADLINES DAVID CAMERON OR SAID BRITAIN WILL SEND A WARSHIP TO THE MEDITERRANEAN TO TACKLE PEOPLE TRAFFICKERS AND AUNT SMUGGLERS CAMPAIGNERS FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE CRITICISED THE GOVERNMENT FOR PUBLISHING FIGURES SUGGESTING THAT BREAKS IT WOULD HIT PENSIONS M.P. SAY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS CLOSE TO BREAKING POINT AND BARACK OBAMA IS PAYING THE FIRST VISIT TO HIROSHIMA BY AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT THE B.B.C. NEWS READ THIS MORNING BY CHRIS
BRITAIN IS POISED TO SEND A WARSHIP TO BOLSTER LIBYAN ATTEMPTS TO STAUNCHED THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN ITALIAN COASTGUARD RESCUED FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE YESTERDAY ALONE ONCE ITS MISSION IS APPROVED THIS SHIP WILL ALSO TARGET BOAT SMUGGLING ARMS TO THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN LIBYA IT'S DEPLOYMENT WAS ANNOUNCED BY DAVID CAMERON LETTER G. SEVEN SUMMIT IN JAPAN FROM WHERE A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE REPORTS
LAST SUNDAY THE NEW LIBYAN GOVERNMENT ASKED THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR MORE HELP IN TRAINING IT'S NAVY AND COASTGUARD TO STOP THE TRAFFICKING OF MIGRANTS ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN DAVID CAMERON'S TOLD WORLD LEADERS OF THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT THAT HE WILL SEND A WARSHIP TO DO THAT AND TAKE ON A NEW ROLE OF SEIZING BOATS THAT ARE SMUGGLING ARMS TO ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS IN LIBYA
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN THE E. USE EXPECTED IN COMING WEEKS TO EXTEND THE MANDATE OF ITS CURRENT NAVAL OPERATION WHICH HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO STOP THE TRAFFIC IN THE U.K. CURRENTLY HAS ONE SURVEY VESSEL H.M.S. ENTERPRISE OPERATING IN THE AREA
PRIME MINISTER SAID HE HAD TO ACT BECAUSE IT WAS IN BRITAIN'S NATIONAL INTEREST TO SUPPORT THE NEW LIBYAN GOVERNMENT WANTS THE RELEVANT PERMISSIONS AND U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION ARE IN PLACE I'LL DEPLOY NAVAL WARSHIP TO THE SOUTH CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN THE COMBAT ARMS TRAFFICKING IN THE REGION
TOGETHER THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL HELP STABILISE THE SECURE ITS COAST AND TACKLE THE MIGRATION CRISIS OFFICIAL SUGGESTED THE WARSHIP COULD ALSO OPERATE FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'VE BEEN LIBYAN TERRITORIAL WATERS ONCE IT HAD BEEN INVITED IN BY THE GOVERNMENT IN TRIPOLI WHICH THEY EXPECTED SOON
IF IT DOES THEN BRITAIN WILL HAVE MOVED AT ANOTHER STEP CLOSER TO DIRECT MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN THE LIBYAN CONFLICT
THE TREASURY HAS PRODUCED FIGURES SUGGESTING THAT MILLIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE PENSIONERS WOULD BE WORSE OFF IF BRITAIN LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH THE BASIC STATE PENSION WORTH AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POUNDS A YEAR LESS IN REAL TERMS CAMPAIGNERS BACKING BRECK'S IT OF RUBBISH THE PREDICTIONS THEY'VE ALSO ACCUSED MINISTERS OF BREACHING THE SPIRIT OF THEIR OWN RULES BY PUBLISHING THE ANALYSIS LATE LAST NIGHT JUST BEFORE THE DEADLINE FOR GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO STAY OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME ON AHMED REPORTS
DESPITE CRITICISM THAT THIS IS A CYNICAL ATTEMPT TO DIVERT ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE INCREASE IN EUROPEAN UNION IMMIGRATION THE GOVERNMENT HAS INSISTED IT'S PENSIONS ANALYSIS IS ROBUST
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POUNDS A YEAR FIGURE COMES FROM A STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF A RISING INFLATION WHICH THE TREASURY SAYS COULD FOLLOW BRECK SAID AND WOULD ERODE THE VALUE OF PENSION INCREASES
A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF STOCK MARKETS COULD ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT AS PENSION FUNDS ARE WIDELY INVESTED IN SHARES SOME ECONOMISTS BELIEVED THAT MARKET VOLATILITY WOULD INCREASE IF BRITAIN LEFT THE E.
POLLING EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT OLDER PEOPLE TEND TO BE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO BREAKS IT AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO FRIGHTEN THE VOTERS INTO SUPPORTING THE U.K. REMAINING IN THE E.U. IT ALSO FACED CRITICISM FOR PUBLISHING THE FIGURES JUST HOURS BEFORE PURDAH RULES KICKED IN AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM THE RULE STOP THE GOVERNMENT USING ITS OWN OFFICIALS TO PRODUCE Y. YOU INFORMATION TO ENSURE THERE IS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN THE TWO CAMPAIGNS
SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME THE LEAF CAMPAIGNER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHO USED TO BE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY QUESTIONED THE ACCURACY OF THE FIGURES
MY VIEW IS EVERY CHANCE THAT IN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION JUST AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER ARGUMENT THAT ACTUALLY DO BETTER OFF SO THE POINT DAD SAYS FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT OTHER SIDE OF THE UPSIDE CASE OF LEAVING WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY INCREASE RESOURCES TO PENSIONS WHEN I WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT'S OUTRAGEOUS I THINK IN A SENSE FOR THEM TO COME OUT AND REALLY TRY AND SCARE PENSIONERS
THE FORMER FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLAND ALEX SALMOND HAS PREDICTED A VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD PROMPT A FRESH REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE WITHIN TWO YEARS SPEAKING AT THE B.B.C. DEBATE IN GLASGOW LAST NIGHT MY SALMON SUGGESTED ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE VOTE WOULD TAKE PLACE OF SCOTLAND VOTED TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. BUT WAS DRAGGED OUT BY THE REST OF THE U.K.
M.P.S ARE WARNING THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS CLOSE TO BREAKING POINT IN A DAMNING REPORT THE COMMONS PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS THE ABILITY OF THE COURTS TO DELIVER JUSTICE IS UNDER THREAT HE'S A LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CLIVE GONE
TODAY'S REPORT IS PEPPERED WITH WORRYING FINDINGS POOR PERFORMANCE IN SUPPORTING VICTIMS AND WITNESSES ONLY FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WITNESSES SAID THEY'D BE ONE AGAIN AND A START POSTCODE LOTTERY FOR JUSTICE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A SEVEN IN TEN CHANCE OF A CROWN COURT TRIAL GOING AHEAD AS SCHEDULED IN NORTH WALES BUT JUST A TWO IN TEN CHANCE IN GREATER MANCHESTER
THE REPORT SAYS THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN TOO SLOW TO ADDRESS FAILINGS AND HAS EXHAUSTED THE SCOPE FOR CARTS GOVERNMENT REFORMS TO MANAGE CASES MORE EFFICIENTLY AND DIGITISE EVIDENCE ARE ACKNOWLEDGED BUT WON'T BE FULLY EFFECTIVE FOR FOUR YEARS
THE M.P.S SAY IMPROVEMENTS SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS WELCOMED THE REPORT SAYING THAT THE NEED FOR URGENT CHANGE HAS LED TO ITS REFORMS AND TWO BILLION POUNDS OF INVESTMENT
IT'S EMERGED THE ACCIDENTAL DELETION OF FINGERPRINTS AND D.N.A. RECORDS OF TERRORISM SUSPECTS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED IN MARCH WAS ALMOST TWICE AS EXTENSIVE AS ORIGINALLY DISCLOSED THE FIGURES ARE CONTAINED IN A REPORT BY THE BIOMETRICS COMMISSIONER HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
UNDER A NEW SYSTEM INTRODUCED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN D.N.A. AND FINGERPRINT PROFILES OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T CONVICTED OF A CRIME HAVE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE DATABASE HOWEVER THE RECORDS CAN BE KEPT IN THE INTERESTS OF NATIONAL SECURITY FOR EXAMPLE IN CASES WHERE SOMEONE IS SUSPECTED OF HAVING LINKS TO TERRORISM
TWO MONTHS AGO THE BIOMETRICS COMMISSIONER SAID FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY D.N.A. PROFILES HAVE BEEN DELETED BEFORE POLICE ARE DECIDED WHETHER THEY WANTED TO KEEP THEM ON SECURITY GROUNDS NOW THE COMMISSIONER ALISDAIR MACGREGOR HAS REVEALED THAT THE NUMBER IS FAR LARGER EIGHT HUNDRED TEN PROFILES HADN'T BEEN ASSESSED BY POLICE BEFORE THEY WERE DUE TO BE DELETED THOUGHT OFFICERS WOULD HAVE APPLIED TO KEEP MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED OF THEM
MISTER MACGREGOR SAID IT WAS A MATTER OF REAL CONCERN THE HOME OFFICE SAID POLICE HAD PROVIDED ASSURANCES THE ISSUE WILL BE KEPT UNDER CLOSE REVIEW
RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DISADVANTAGED AREAS OF SCOTLAND ARE FOUR TIMES LESS LIKELY TO GO TO UNIVERSITY BUT THOSE FROM WEALTHY BACKGROUNDS DESPITE THE ABOLITION OF TUITION FEES BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT IN ENGLAND POORER STUDENTS ARE ONLY TWO POINT FOUR TIMES LESS LIKELY TO ATTEND UNIVERSITY
THE STUDY BY THE SUTTON TRUST AND EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY CONCLUDES THE DISPARITY IS PARTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A CAP ON UNIVERSITY PLACES IN SCOTLAND THE REPORT'S AUTHOR IS LUCY HUNTER BLACK
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE DONE IT IN SCOTLAND OVER RECENT YEARS IS PUT IN MORE PLACES WHICH ARE RING FENCED FOR MORE DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE DATA THAT THAT HAS HAD AN EFFECT PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF IMPROVING THEIR ACCESS TO YE OLDE UNIVERSITIES SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS THAT THAT SORT OF SCHEME REALLY DOES NEED TO CONTINUE
SEARCH TEAMS IN THAILAND ARE TRYING TO FIND A BRITISH MAN WHO'S MISSING AFTER A SPEEDBOAT CAPSIZED KILLING THREE WOMEN INCLUDING ONE FROM THE U.K. POLICE SAY THE BOAT HIT A LARGE WAY THAT OVERTURNED OFF THE ISLAND OF COSIMA
UNIONS AT THE FRENCH ENERGY GIANT E.D.F. HAVE TOLD B.B.C. NEWS THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S PLANS TO BUILD AN EIGHTEEN BILLION POUND POWER PLANT AT HINKLEY POINT IN SOMERSET UNLESS CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ARE MADE E.D.F. WHICH IS LARGELY OWNED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IS DUE TO MAKE A FINAL DECISION IN THE AUTUMN HERE'S CHRIS COOK
HINKLEY POINT C. IS SUPPOSED TO EVENTUALLY SUPPLY SEVEN PER CENT OF ALL THE U.K.'S ELECTRICITY NEEDS A COLOSSAL PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE BUT A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO ITS CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN THE OPPOSITION OF UNIONS WITHIN THE E.D.F. WHO ARE POLITICALLY POWERFUL IN FRANCE AND HOLD SIX OF THE EIGHTEEN SEATS ON THE E.D.F. BOUGHT
EARLY THIS MONTH E.D.F. STARTED A CONSULTATION WITH A COMMITTEE OF UNIONS TO WIN THEM OVER BUT JEAN LUC BAG NEVER THE COMMITTEE SECRETARY TOLD HIS NIGHTS WE HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT ORGANISATION SUPPLY CHAIN INSTALLATION AND PROCUREMENT HE SAID THE UNIONS WERE UNLIKELY TO GIVE THEIR BLESSING TO THE PROJECT IN ITS CURRENT STATE
MUCH SCEPTICISM IS DRIVEN BY THE STRAIN ON E.D.S. BALANCE SHEET AND PROBLEMS BUILDING PLANTS A SIMILAR DESIGN HOWEVER EARLIER THIS MONTH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS HOLLANDE SAID HE WAS IN FAVOUR OF THE PROJECT GOING AHEAD
BARACK OBAMA WILL BECOME THE FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT THE JAPANESE CITY OF HIROSHIMA THIS MORNING HE'S ALREADY SAID HE WILL NOT OFFER AN APOLOGY FOR THE DROPPING OF THE ATOMIC BOMB ON THE CITY IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE BUT WILL INSTEAD HONOUR ALL THOSE WHO WERE LOST IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR FROM HIROSHIMA JOHN SOUTHWORTH
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS DECISIONS EVER TAKEN BY A U.S. PRESIDENT THE USE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST ATOMIC WEAPON ON AN ALREADY VERY WEAKENED JAPAN KILLING AN ESTIMATED SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN AN INSTANT
THE OFFICIAL NARRATIVE THAT THE HIROSHIMA BOMB HELPED HASTEN THE END OF THE WAR AND PREVENTED THE LOSS OF MANY MORE LIVES IN A LAND INVASION HAS PREVENTED SUBSEQUENT HOLDERS OF THE OFFICE FROM VISITING UNTIL NOW
ANTICIPATING THE CRITICISM FROM VETERAN GROUP'S AT HOME PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ALREADY HAD TO INSIST HE IS NOT HERE TO APOLOGISE HE'S EXPECTED TO LAY A WREATH AT THE CENOTAPH IN HIROSHIMA PEACE PARK IN A BRIEF CEREMONY ATTENDED BY THE JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SINN SEO A BAY AND A NUMBER OF SURVIVORS OF THE ATTACK
I WAS JOHN SIDE WORTH THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT TO NOT TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IF YOU VALUE YOUR PENSION THAT IS THE THRUST OF THE GOVERNMENT'S LATEST BROADSIDE IN THE E.U. DEBATE THEY KNOW THAT THE POLLS SUGGEST THAT OLDER PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE LEAVE AND THIS MORNING THEY ARE SUGGESTING THAT RETIRED PEOPLE AND INDEED THOSE WHO ARE CLOSE TO RETIREMENT HAVE MUCH TO LOSE IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THINK AGAIN THEY ARE SUGGESTING THE PENSIONS MINISTER ROS ALTMANN LADY'LL THEM HE'S A FORMER PENSIONS EXPERT AND SHE
HE'S MAKING THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE I ASKED CERTAIN THAT CASE WAS ALL THE CREDIBLE ECONOMIC FORECASTS CONFIRM THAT IF WE DO TAKE THE DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. IT WILL HIT THE ECONOMY
WHATEVER HITS THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO HIT PENSIONS WE'VE SEEN IT BEFORE I'VE LOOKED AT PENSIONS FOR YEARS IF THEY'RE IS ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY MARKETS DON'T DO WELL
IF THERE IS ECONOMIC WEAKNESS COMPANIES CAN'T DO WELL AND THAT MEANS THAT YOUR INVESTMENT IN PENSIONS AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN BE PUT INTO PENSIONS WILL FALL COME ON THEY ARE YOU DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA PERFECTLY WELL DON'T YOU THE COMPANIES WILL SEE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES IF THERE'S TURBULENCE IN MARKETS ALSO THE COMPANIES THAT MAKE THEIR MONEY ABROAD WILL SEE THE VALUE OF THAT MONEY RISE AGAINST STERLING STERLING FOURS ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN INCLUDING ACTUALLY QUITE A GOOD STORY
THE COMPANY'S BITTERLY FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES IN THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE'S PENSION INVESTMENTS ARE DAMAGED PERMANENTLY OR IN FOR A LONG TIME IS BALONEY ISN'T IT NO NOT AT ALL I MEAN THERE THERE IS A RANGE OF FORECASTS BUT ALL THE SERIOUS ECONOMIC FORECASTERS
BY EVERY SERIOUS ECONOMIC OBSERVER IS THAT THE ECONOMY WILL BE WEAKER IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. IT'S NOT JUST TREASURY FIGURES IT'S THE AYE AYE A FIRST THEORY SEE O.E.C.D. THE N. I S. ARE THE I.M.F. MANAGING DIRECTOR BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS THEY ALL AGREE LEAVING WILL DAMAGE OUR ECONOMY YES BUT THE OTHER VALUE OF INVESTMENT IN THEIR VALUE INVESTMENTS GO UP AND DOWN AS EVERYONE WHO DOES INVEST NOSE AND SOMEONE LIKE NEIL WOODFORD IN FATTY YOU'LL KNOW WELL STAR INVESTOR
SET UP HIS OWN FUND A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE INVESTED IN HIS FARM BETTER OFF PEOPLE WHO'RE LOOKING TO SAVE THE MONEY FOR THEIR A TIME AND HE SAYS THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY WILL BE UNMOVED EITHER WAY WELL I'M AFRAID THAT EVERY EVERY SERIOUS ECONOMIC FORECASTER WOULD NOT AGREE HE'S NOT SERIOUS
NOT FOR ECONOMIC FORECAST CLEARLY THERE ARE YOU ON BEHALF OF PENSIONERS THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT YOUR GOVERNMENT NO BETTER THAN HE DOES
I'M NOT TALKING JUST ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT I'M TALKING ABOUT EVERY MAJOR ECONOMIC FORECASTER A WEAKER ECONOMY MEANS LOWER WAGES LOWER PROFITS LOWER DIVIDENDS LOWER INVESTMENT RETURNS AND LOWER PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AS WELL AS LOWER PENSION FUND INVESTMENTS THAT I MEAN IF THIS ISN'T SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY IT'S A CONSENSUS HERE
IT'S NOT I CAN SENSE AS THERE IS THERE'S A A PLENTY OF ECONOMISTS WHO ALSO ARGUED THAT THEY WILL BE REASONS WHY THE ECONOMY MIGHT BE STRONGER IN THE LONG TERM IF WE WERE TO LEAVE PLUS PLUS IN THIS IS THE REALLY IMPORTANT POINT FOR PENSIONS WHICH IS THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING TODAY ACTUALLY FOR PEOPLE WHOSE MONEY IS INVESTED AROUND THE WORLD A FALL IN THE VALUE OF STERLING WHICH A LOT OF ECONOMISTS THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION A FALL IN THE VALUE OF STERLING WOULD BE NO BAD THING FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT'S TRUE
WELL IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BUT IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAKER AND EVERYBODY WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT WOULD BE AS A RESULT NOT ONLY OF THE UNCERTAINTY CREATED BECAUSE THOSE WHO ARE SUGGESTING THAT LEAVING IS A GOOD IDEA HAVE NOT COME UP WITH A CREDIBLE ECONOMIC SCENARIO WHERE THE U.K. ACTUALLY DOES BETTER APART FROM THOSE WHO THINK OUR MANUFACTURING BASE WILL BE DESTROYED
BUT THE REST OF THE ECONOMY MIGHT TAKE OVER SOMEHOW WE DON'T WE DO THAT WILL MEAN WE'LL LOSE JOBS WE WILL HAVE LOWER WAGES IF
STERLING FALLS INFLATION WILL GO UP AND AGAIN THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH IS BAD FOR PENSIONS AND BAD FOR PENSIONERS YOU KNOW WHAT A PENSIONER'S WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THEY WANT CERTAINTY WHAT IS BEING OFFERED BY VOTING TO LEAVE ITS MASSIVE UNCERTAINTY AND PENSIONERS
RELY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THEIR SECURITY AND STABILITY WHERE IS LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD MADE HUGE UNCERTAINTY YOU SAY PENSIONS WANT CERTAINTY THAT THERE ARE E.U. REGULATIONS AREN'T THAT FOR THE HARMONISATION OF OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS
REGULATIONS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY THIS GOVERNMENT AS DAMAGING AND RECKLESS DO THEY STILL HANG OVER US WELL WHAT WE'VE MANAGED TO DO BY BEING INSIDE THE E.U. IS THAT WE HAVE MOVED THE DECISIONS IN OUR FAVOUR SO THAT ACTUALLY WE'VE MOVED AWAY FROM MANY OF THE PROPOSALS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DAMAGING FOR A PENSION FUND HAVE WE HAVE WE GOT RID OF THAT THREAT AS THE GUY
WELL MOST OF WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN THREATENED AND PEOPLE KEPT SAYING ALL THIS IS GOING TO BE BAD FOR PENSION THAT'S GOING TO DESTROY PENSION FOR THEM IT'S NOT HAPPENING THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION INDEED THERE COULD TO PEOPLE LIKE ME YEAH BUT YOU KNOW WITH SWEETS SO THAT JONATHAN HILL JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT IT THAT FRANK IS NOW OVER
THAT THREAT IS NOW BEING DEALT WITH AND SO IT IS IT IS IT OVER
YES AS FAR AS I KNOW BUT THAT'S THE POINT IF WE GET MORE PROPOSALS THAT MIGHT DAMAGE OUR PENSIONS INDUSTRY THAT MIGHT DAMAGE OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY
THEN WE ARE AT THE TABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT CAN PROTECT OURSELVES CAN I TURN TO
TARTAR AND WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO THE SCHEME BECAUSE THERE IS A SUGGESTION ISN'T THAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT INTERVENE SO THAT THE TART UP PENSION SCHEME IS MADE EASIER TO HANDLE IN THE LONG TURN HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CONSUMER PRICES RATHER THAN RETAIL PRICES AND THAT SOUND RATHER TECHNICAL BASICALLY RETAIL PRICES GO UP QUICKER SO IT WOULD MEAN
THE PENSIONS WOULDN'T GO UP AS FAST THAT YOUR PREDECESSOR STEVE WEBB FORMER PENSIONS MINISTER SUGGESTING THAT THAT MIGHT BE A DANGEROUS THING WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW OF AT THE MOMENT LET JUSTIN THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS A CRUCIAL INDUSTRY FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY IT'S VITAL THAT WE DO WHATEVER WE
TO MAKE SURE THAT BRITAIN STILL HAS STEEL MANUFACTURING AND TO PROTECT THE INDUSTRY AND WE'VE LAUNCHED A WIDE RANGING CONSULTATION WE HAVEN'T DECIDED ANYTHING WE ARE LOOKING AT WHETHER THIS IS
A SPECIAL CASE HOW WE SHOULD TREAT THIS AND IT'S RIGHT THAT WE HAVE A BROAD CONSULTATION AND I'M PLEASED THAT WE ARE CONSULTING ON ALL THESE ISSUES BUT WE ARE GENUINELY CONSULTING THERE ARE A RANGE OF OPTIONS
WE NEED THAT WHAT PEOPLE SAY THAT IS ONE THAT IS ONE OF THEM BUT YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY TO COME BACK TO YOU IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME AND LET YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONSULTATION THIRD OF ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO WE ALREADY KNOW THEY WHAT YOU THINK BEHIND THE SCENES THIS AGAIN BEFORE YOU WERE IN GOVERNMENT WHEN YOU WERE AN EXPERT ON THESE THINGS YOU DESCRIBED OPERATING PENSIONS BY C.P. I INSTEAD OF A P. I WAS SHOCKING IF YOU ONLY INCREASE PENSIONS BY C.P.I. PENSIONERS BECOME POORER AND POORER HAD HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND
I'M STILL A PENSIONS EXPERT IN GOVERNMENT AND I AM STILL DETERMINED THAT WE WILL PROTECT PENSIONS WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING I SURE YOU TO UNDERMINE THE PENSION SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND THE PENSION PROTECTION MECHANISMS THAT WE HAD WITH OUR STEVE WEBB'S POINT ISN'T IT THE FORMER MINISTER THAT ACTUALLY THE POTENTIAL EVEN IF YOU DID IT JUST FOR THIS ONE COMPANY THE POTENTIAL WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY UNDERMINE OTHER COMPANIES WERE THEN APPLY IN THE FUTURE IN THAT THAT IS A RISK ISN'T IT
THAT IS WHY WE ARE HAVING A WIDE RANGING CONSULTATION AND I'M I'M PLEASED THAT WE ARE BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT INDUSTRY AND IT'S A VERY LARGE PENSION SCHEME WITH LOTS OF PENSIONERS AND LOTS OF OF MEMBERS WHO WILL BE RELYING ON IT AND I CARE ABOUT PEOPLE AND THEIR PENSIONS
AND I CARE ABOUT OUR PENSION SYSTEM AND THEREFORE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK WIDELY LISTENED TO WHAT THE CONSULTATION RESPONSES SAY AND THEN AS I SAY I CAN COME BACK TO YOU IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME AND WE CAN DISCUSS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THAT WAS A PENSIONS MINISTER ON SODA KUMMEL ARMOURED OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR
I THINK ONCE YOU'VE MADE THE BIG ARGUMENT THAT THE ECONOMY IF BRITAIN WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD BE SMALLER OR WE WOULD GO INTO RECESSION AND AS ROS ALTMANN SAID THE CONSENSUS MAYBES CONTACTS IS TOO STRONG A WORD BUT THE BROAD OPINION OF MOST EXPERT ORGANISATIONS IN ECONOMICS IS THAT
IT'LL BE A SMALLER ECONOMY SOME BELIEVE AT THE MOST PESSIMISTIC AND A POSSIBLE RECESSION ONCE YOU'VE MADE THAT ARGUMENT THE EXTRAPOLATION ON THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENCE ONS DIFFERENT SECTORS IS RELATIVELY RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD SO WE'VE HAD THE IMPACT POSSIBLE IMPACT ON HOUSE PRICES POSSIBLE IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT NOW THE IMPACT POSSIBLY ON PENSIONS
THE REALLY CLEAR WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON TRADE THAT IS WHERE ECONOMIES ARE MOST CERTAIN WITH THE MODELLING I THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM THOUGH HERE THAT AS YOU GO THROUGH EACH SECTOR THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE COMPLICATED AND DIFFUSE AND IN PENSION THIS ABOUT ASSET PRICES AS YOU PUSHED HER ON HOW ALL THE MARKET RESPOND
IT IS ALSO ON EUROPEAN UNION REGULATION THE PENSIONS INDUSTRY IN THE U.K. HAS BEEN VERY VERY AGGRESSIVE ABOUT HOW EUROPEAN UNION REGULATION HAS AFFECTED NEGATIVELY THE BRITISH PENSIONS SYSTEM IT ALSO DEPENDS ON WHAT IS THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE OF THE GOVERNMENT IF THERE IS A RECESSION AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL PRESUMABLY ACT ON THAT AND PUT IN PLACE NEW POLICIES TO TRY AND TO TRY AND HELP THE BRITISH ECONOMY THE BANK OF ENGLAND BUT ALSO DYNAMICALLY RESPOND
INTEREST RATES MAY GO UP SOME ARGUE IF INTEREST RATES GO UP THAT'S GOOD FOR PEOPLE AND ANNUITIES THAT'S THE THING WE BUY TO HELP US PAY OUR PENSIONS INTO THE FUTURE THAT COULD BE GOOD FOR NEW IT IS ISN'T SHE I SPOKE TO MORE HARVEY'S LANDS THAT ONE OF THE THE BIG INVESTMENT ORGANISATIONS AND SAVINGS ADVISERS THEY SAID HE WAS AMBITIOUS TO TRY AND SUGGEST TO THE PUBLIC BUT YOU KNOW HOW ALL THESE MOVING PARTS WILL AFFECT OF THE PENSIONS INDUSTRY AND PENSIONERS
DOWN TO ALMOST POUNDS AND PENCE THAT'S I THINK IS WHERE THE SOME OF THE ISSUES AND JUST A QUICK ONE ON TATA STEEL'S PENSION IT'S AN INTERESTING ONE ISN'T IT BECAUSE IT SAYS EVERYTHING IS NOW OPEN INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF RIG A CHANGE THAT MIGHT BE QUITE A FUNDAMENTAL ONE FOR OTHER PENSION SCHEMES AS WELL
WELL ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THE CHANGE FROM RETAIL PRICES INDEX TO P. CONSUMER PRICES INDEX DOES MEAN AN ACTUAL LOSS IN REAL TERMS FOR PENSIONERS AND ONCE YOU START IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO MOVE BETWEEN THOSE TWO
FIGURES THAT MEANS THAT THE ACTUAL INCOME ARE PENSIONERS COULD BE NEGATIVE EFFECT AND I THINK THE POINT IS ONCE YOU'VE STARTED IT TO RESCUE ONE COMPANY WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT WHEN ANOTHER COMPANY COMES TO YOU AND SAYS WE WANT THE SAME TERMS MY LLAMA THANK VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE ECONOMISTS RUSSIAN AND EASTERN EUROPE EUROPE EDITOR A CARDIO STRAFE SKI HAS WON THE ORWELL PRIZE FOR BOOKS FOR THE INVENTION OF RUSSIA THE PRIZE AIMS TO REWARD WRITING THAT COMES CLOSEST TO ACHIEVING ALL WAS AMBITION TO MAKE POLITICAL WRITING AND ART WELL THE INVENTION OF RUSSIA'S A BOOK AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE COUNTRY SINCE SOVIET TIMES FROM MIKHAIL GORBACHEV'S OPENING UP OF SOCIETY TO VLADIMIR PUTIN'S MORE BELLICOSE APPROACH BUT THROUGH IT ALL
HE FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA IN CREATING A NATIONAL NARRATIVE WHILE A CARDIE OST ROSKA JOINS US HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND IT IS THE ROLE OF PROPAGANDA WHICH IN OR WHEN YOU'RE SURPRISING BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS SOMETHING FROM THE
PERHAPS MORE THAN WE WOULD MORE TYPICALLY FOCUS ON FROM THE OLD REGIME YES THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE WE THINK OF PROPAGANDA AS AS PART OF IDEOLOGY AND IT WAS IN THE SOVIET TIMES AND THE SOVIET REGIME RESTED VERY MUCH ON TWO PILLARS ONE WAS REPRESSION SAW THE THREAT OF REPRESSIONS AND THE OTHER WAS IDEOLOGY AND WHEN GORBACHEV STARTED OPENING UP THE COUNTRY AND INTRODUCING GLASSON IS THE OPENNESS OF THE MEDIA AND PULLED
THE SECOND PILLAR THE IDEOLOGY FROM UNDER THE SYSTEM AND OPPRESSIONS WERE ALREADY WEAKENED THE WHOLE TH THING CAME CRASHING DOWN NOW PROPAGANDA PLAYED A VERY DIFFERENT ROLE IN IN PUTIN'S RUSSIA IT'S NOT IDEOLOGICAL IT'S IT'S REALLY ABOUT CREATING A DIFFERENT REALITY OF VIRTUAL REALITY IF YOU LIKE INVENTING FACTS
INVENTING IMAGERY AND WE'VE SEEN WHAT THIS CAN DO IN THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE AND ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA DIE BECAUSE DO YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT ALTHOUGH DURING SOVIET TIMES RUSSIANS REJECTED THE PROPAGANDA OR RECOGNISED IT AS SUCH THEY DON'T RECOGNISE WHAT'S GOING ON NOW IT'S PROPAGANDA
THIS IS THE THIS IS THE SUBTLETY OF IT IS THE SAVING GRACE OF THE SOVIET PROPAGANDA WAS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE BELIEVED IT BECAUSE YOUR EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE WENT AGAINST IT YOU WERE TOLD ON THE RADIO OR TELEVISION THAT THE COUNTRY WE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY IS BOOMING BOOMING IT'S PRODUCING MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN THAN ANY CAPITALIST ECONOMY AND THEN HE WENT TO THE SHOP AND YOU SAW EMPTY SHELVES
AND THAT KNOW WAS A VERY GOOD REALITY CHECK ON ON WHAT WAS HAPPENING NOW THE PROPAGANDA OF TODAY WHICH IS VERY MUCH FOCUSES ON THE OUTSIDE ON THE EXPERIENCES WHICH PEOPLE CANNOT CHECK WITH THEIR OWN LIVES WITH THEIR OWN EYES
THIS IS THE PROPAGANDA WHICH PEOPLE CHOOSE TO BELIEVE IT'S NOT JUST IMPOSED ON THEM IT'S A MUCH MORE SUBTLE RELATIONSHIP IT'S THE STATE REALISING WHAT HAVE THE WEAK WEAK POINTS IN PEOPLE'S MINDS WHAT DO THEY WANT TO HEAR AND PEOPLE CHOOSE TO BELIEVE IT AND IT'S PLAYING ON ALL SORTS OF THINGS ON THE HUMILIATION AFTER THE SOVIET COLLAPSE ON THE CRAVING FOR RUSSIAN GREATNESS AND EMPIRE
IT'S THE THE HORRIBLE THING ABOUT THIS PROPAGANDA IS THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO BELIEVE IT WHICH SUGGESTS THEN THAT WHATEVER ELSE VLADIMIR PUTIN MAY BE GUILTY OF IT'S THE CONTROL OF THE MEDIA WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE MEDIA AND THE MASSIVE AND IDEAS
AND THE MEDIA ALWAYS PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN RUSSIA RUSSIA'S A VERY IDEA CENTRIC COUNTRY IN THAT RESPECT BUT YES HE SEIZED ON THAT HIS RULE THE VERY FIRST THING THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN DID WHEN HE BECAME PRESIDENT WAY BEFORE HE GOT CONTROL OVER THE OIL AND GAS AND ALL THE COMMANDING HEIGHTS OF THE ECONOMY HE TOOK CONTROL OF A TELEVISION AND SINCE THEN TELEVISION BECAME THE PRIMARY TOOL OF HIS RULE BASICALLY
SO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE WON THIS PRIZE TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT WELL TO BE HONEST WHEN I STARTED WRITING THIS BOOK I DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WAS GOING TO END IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A BOOK ABOUT RUSSIA'S TRANSFORMATION FROM GORBACHEV'S TIME TO SORT OF MORE AUTOCRATIC
THERE'S A SENSE OF THE BELLICOSE REGIME OF PUTIN BUT THIS WAS BEFORE THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND BEFORE THEN EXHALATION OF CRIME IN WHICH THE MEDIA REALLY DID PLAY HER PRIMARY ROLE ON THE ARMY SORT OF CAME SECOND SO ONLY WATCHED THE STORY UNFOLD AND VERY ORWELLIAN TERMS AND THE FURTHER IT WENT
INTO THE CONFLICT THE MORE ORWELLIAN IN BECAME WITH WE'RE REALLY PIECE WAS WAR AND
AND ALL THIS LOOK ALL THE THINGS THAT ORWELL DESCRIBES AND IN BRITAIN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WITHOUT EVER HAVING BEEN TO THE SOVIET UNION AND THAT TO ME IS ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING THINGS AS HOW COULD SOMEBODY HAS NEVER BEEN TO THE COUNTRY UNDERSTAND HOW IT FUNCTIONS SO WELL SO TO ME THIS IS A TRIBUTE REALLY TO ALL WILL TO HIS UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS SOCIETY'S WORK WHEN A CARDIO STRANSKY CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WHERE THAN SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S HALF PAST EIGHT LET'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM CHRIS ALDRIDGE A ROYAL NAVY WARSHIP IS TO BE DEPLOYED TO HELP LIBYAN COASTGUARD TO PUT AN END TO THE TRAFFICKING OF MIGRANTS ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN BRITISH OFFICIALS WERE ALSO SEEKING APPROVAL FROM THE U.N. FOR THE SHIP TO INTERCEPT BOATS SUSPECTED OF SMUGGLING WEAPONS TO THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN LIBYA
THE TREASURY HAS RELEASED FIGURES SUGGESTING THAT A VOTE FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH LEAVE MILLIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE PENSIONERS WORSE OFF IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHO'S A BRECHT'S IT CAMPAIGNER ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF AN OUTRAGEOUS ATTEMPT TO SCARE PENSIONERS BUT THE PENSIONS MINISTER LADY OLDMAN TOLD US THE TREASURY WAS IN LINE WITH MANY OTHER ORGANISATIONS IN FORECASTING THAT LEAVING THE Y. YOU WOULD HIT THE ECONOMY HARD AND THAT WOULD AFFECT PENSIONS
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S IS WARNING THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS BEEN LEFT CLOSE TO BREAKING POINT BY DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT HAD INTRODUCED REFORMS DESIGNED TO BUILD A QUICKER AND MORE CERTAIN SYSTEM OF JUSTICE
BARACK OBAMA WILL BECOME THE FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT THE JAPANESE CITY OF HIROSHIMA THIS MORNING HE'S ALREADY MADE CLEAR HE WILL NOT APOLOGISE FOR AMERICA'S DECISION TO DROP THE ATOMIC BOMB ON THE CITY IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE THE PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON'S BEEN SPEAKING AT THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT IN JAPAN IN THE LAST HOUR A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE IS TRAVELLING WITH HIM AND JOINS US NOW AND JAMES HAS BEEN TALKING TO A WHOLE RAFT OF THINGS NOT LEAST THE DECISION TO SEND A NEW WARSHIP INTO LIBYAN WATERS
YES ESSENTIALLY THE PRIME MINISTER SEES THIS AS A SORT OF STEP FORWARD FOR THE CURRENT YOU OPERATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IT'S BEEN PRETTY EFFECTIVE AND OPERATING AS A SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION PICKING UP THE MIGRANTS BOATS AS THEY COME ACROSS BUT LESS SUCCESSFUL AND ACTUALLY DETERRING THEM LEAVING IN THE FIRST PLACE AND REALLY TACKLING
PEOPLE TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS ESSENTIALLY THIS WARSHIP THAT HE'S GOING TO SEND HIM WILL DO TWO THINGS ONE MUSICAL TRAIN UP THE LIBYAN COASTGUARD AND NAVY SUCH THAT IT IS SO THAT IT CAN TAKE ON THAT ROLE OF ACTUALLY STOPPING TRYING TO STOP ON THESE BOATS LEAVING THE BEACHES IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT SECONDLY THE SHIP WILL HAVE A SECOND ROLE AND THAT WOULD BE TO DETECT AND SEES BOATS THAT ARE SMUGGLING ARMS TO ISIS
A LOT OF DIPLOMATIC ACTION IS REQUIRED BEFORE THAT CAN HAPPEN THE EMU HAS TO FORMALLY AGREED TO EXPAND ITS MANDATE IN THE REGION A U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL IS NEEDED BEFORE YOU CAN START DOING ANY KIND OF TACKLING OF THE ARMS MODE BUT
THE REALLY BIG QUESTION IS THIS WILL THIS WARSHIP OPERATE WITHIN LIBYAN TERRITORIAL WATERS NOW THE FORMAL INVITATION SO FAR DOES NOT INCLUDE THAT
BUT THE BRITISH OFFICIALS SAY THAT THEY ARE EXPECTING THAT INVITATION SOMETIME SOON AND IF THAT HAPPENS AND IF A BRITISH WARSHIP DOES START SAILING
IN LIVE IN TERRITORIAL WATERS THEN WE HAVE MOVED ANOTHER STEP FORWARD TO DEEPER BRITISH INVOLVEMENT IN THE LIVE IN COMFORT
AND JAMES ARE WE ALSO OF COURSE CAN'T ESCAPE THE E.U. REFERENDUM AND INSISTING THAT HE'S NOT A CLOSET BRECK'S
THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE CLAIMS THAT STEVE HILTON IS FORMER ADVISER AND CLOSE FRIENDS HAD ACTUALLY DAVID COMES ACROSS BREAKFASTED
I WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS AND HE SAID I'M NOT I'M NOT A CLOSET ANYTHING REALLY AND HE MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSISTENT IN HIS OPINION ARE THAT YES BRITAIN COULD ALWAYS IS HE SAID IT COULD FIND ITS WAY OUTSIDE OF THE E.U. BUT BRITAIN COULDN'T BE AT ITS BEST
IF IT WASN'T THERE AND THEN HE MADE THE ODD SPECIFICALLY HE MADE HER SEVERAL TIMES THIS MORNING THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IF BRITAIN STAYED IN IT COULD STAY PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET WHEREAS IF THAT HE SAID THE LEVER SAID THEY'VE DECIDED THAT IF BRITONS OUT WON'T BE PART OF THE SUPERMARKET THAT WOULD SUFFER IN HIS VIEW
SO AS EVER BRICKS IT'S ON THE MARGINS FOLLOWS HIM ROUND I THINK YOU'LL BE QUITE GLAD RIGHT NOW TO BE BACK ON HIS PLANE HEADING BACK TO A CAMPAIGN THAT FRANKLY HE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO LEAVE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS BUT THIS WAS ONE THING SHE COULDN'T MISS JAMES THANK THANKS VERY MUCH
THE TYPE TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO LINE OF ALL THE NATIONS IN THE U.K. NORTHERN IRELAND HAS RECEIVED A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION FARMING SUBSIDIES INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT SO CALLED PEACE MONEY TO HELP HEAL THE DIVISIONS OF THE TROUBLES AS A NET BENEFICIARY OVER MANY YEARS SURELY IT IS A GIVEN THAT IT WILL VOTE TO STAY IN THE POLLS SUGGEST THAT REMAIN ARE IN THE LEAD BUT THE D.U.P. PARTY OF MISTER ARLENE FOSTER IS BACK IN BRECHT'S
THE ONLY ONE OF THE BIG PARTIES IN NORTH LONDON TO DO SO SHALL IS IN LONDONDERRY AT THIS MORNING WITH MORE ON THE HELLO
JUSTIN HELLO WE'RE ARE IN THE LONDONDERRY DERRY CITY CENTRE NOW RIGHT ON THE PEACE BRIDGE ACROSS THE RIVER FOYLE IT'S A CYCLE AND FOOTPRINT FOOTBRIDGE THAT WAS PAID FOR BY E.U. MONEY COST ABOUT FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS IT OPENED IN TWENTY ELEVEN A SYMBOL OF THAT MONEY YOU TALK ABOUT THAT DID COME IN FROM THE E.U. IS COMING IN FROM THE E.U.
IN SUPPORT OF THE PEACE PROCESS SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT WHERE NORTHERN IRELAND'S POLITICAL PARTY STAND OVERALL ON THE REFERENDUM AS YOU SAID THE LARGEST PARTY THE D.U.P. HAS OPTED FOR BRICKS IT THE MAJORITY OF THE OTHER PARTIES SINN FEIN THE S.D.L.P. ALLIANCE AND EVEN THE ULSTER UNIONISTS THE U. U. P. ARE BACKING REMAIN WE'RE JOINED ON THE BRIDGE BY GREGORY CAMPBELL WHO'S THE D.U.P. M. P. FOR EAST LONDONDERRY AND FROM BELFAST BY CLAIRE HANNAH THE S.D.L.P. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BELFAST SOUTH GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING
GREGORY CAMPBELL THAT WOULD BE SURPRISING TO MANY PEOPLE THAT YOUR PARTY HAS CHOSEN TO COME OUT FOR BRICKS IT WHY
WE THINK THAT THE ISSUES ARE FAIRLY WAIT WHILE THEY ARE COMPLEX THEY'RE FAIRLY DRAMATIC IN TERMS OF THE EMANCIPATION THAT WOULD OCCUR TO THE KINGDOM WERE TO LEAVE THE
THE RESTRICTIONS THE BUREAUCRACY THE COST THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CONTINUED EUROPEAN EXPANSION ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE THINK
PROPELLED MOST PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IT EVEN THOSE WHO WANT CHANGE IN EUROPE BUT DON'T ARE AS DRAMATIC AS THOSE OF US THAT WANT TO LEAVE COMPLETELY
EVEN THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD SAY WILL ONLY GET CHANGE IF WE HAVE TO LEAVE BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A FORTY YEAR IMPETUS WHICH HAS CREATED THE BASIS OF A EUROPEAN SUPERSTATE
IN EUROPE AND WE WILL NEVER CHANGE A FROM WITHIN BUT THE REASON THAT THAT IS SURPRISING COMING FROM WHERE WE ARE IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THIS REGION IN PARTICULAR BENEFITS FROM MONEY COMING IN FROM THE U.S. STANDING ON THIS PEACE BRIDGE
RIGHT NOW SO FINANCIALLY DOPE THE SUMS SUGGESTS THAT YOU SHOULD BE IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN
I THINK IT WOULD IF THAT WAS E.U. MONEY FROM SORT OF EXTRANEOUS OR MONEY THAT WAS INJECTED INTO NORTHERN IRELAND BUT MOST OF IT DESIRABLE A MONEY MOST OF IT IS YOU CAME WITH ME
THAT THIS RECYCLED THROUGH EUROPE AND THEY KEEP MOST OF THAT OUT OF THEIR LARGESSE ALLY ASKED THEIR SON BACK TO BUILD STRUCTURES LIKE THE ONE WE'RE STANDING ON THE PEACE BRIDGE LET ME TURN THEN TO CLAIRE HANNAH OF THE S.D.L.P. WHY ARE YOU IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN WELL WE ARE VERY FIRMLY WE THINK FIRSTLY THE ECONOMIC CASE IS VERY CLEAR ONE ANY OF JOBS HERE IS LINKED TO Y. YOU TREATED
ABOUT THREE PER CENT OF OF G.D.P. AND AS YOU'VE SAID INVESTMENT ACROSS ACTORS NOT LEAST AGRICULTURE AND AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BUT INVESTMENT LIKE THAT UNDER YOUR FEET WE WE DO GET CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN A NOMINAL SHARE OF
THE U.K.'S FEES SO WE THINK IT WOULD BE LUNACY FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IN FINANCIAL TERMS BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S A WIDER HAD TO BE AT THE MOTHER AND BECAUSE OF THE VALUES OF EUROPE AND THE FACT THAT IN A BIG WIDE UNCERTAIN WORLD WE DON'T WANT TO RETREAT AND A SHELL ANY MORE PEOPLE ACROSS THE WATER HERE ARE SUPPORTING THE REMAIN CAMPION DO
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THE STRING TO MONEY THAT'S COMING IN AND THE FARMING SUBSIDIES AND TALK TO FARMERS AS AS I HAVE DONE TODAY YOU CAN SEE HOW HOW HARD IT IS FOR THEM ALREADY HOW MUCH FARMING INCOMES HAVE DROPPED SO IT'S NOT AS IF THIS REGION IS DOING FANTASTICALLY WELL BECAUSE OF SOME OF THOSE STREAMS OF FUNDING
WELL WE WE BELIEVE IT WOULD DO CONSIDERABLY WORSE I'D SIDE EUROPE WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO EXPECTATION THAT THE CONSERVATIVE LONDON CURRENT CONSERVATIVE LONDON GOVERNMENT WOULD REPLACE THE MONEY THAT WE LOSE FROM THE E.U. WE WENT ON ON THE BARNET CONSEQUENCES IN THE BASIS OF NEED BE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY GET THAT BUT THE INVESTMENT IN OUR FARMING UNDER FISHERIES HAS LLOYD THOSE SECTORS TO MODERNISE AND TO DIVERSIFY AND THE FACT IS WITH AN IRISH PRODUCERS
AND A GOOD FOODS IS A MUCH BIGGER PART OF OUR ECONOMY HERE THAN IT WOULD BE IN ENGLAND THERE WAS GREAT USUALLY THEY COME TO FIND OUT THEY CAN I JUST WANT I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT TO GREGORY CAMPBELL YOU CAN'T BE SURE THAT THE THAT THE CHANCELLOR WITH US GEORGE OSBORNE OR SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO MATCH WHAT YOU WERE
BUT WE CAN'T BE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET THE FUNDING THAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING OF OUR OWN MONEY IN THE FUTURE AND FACT WHENEVER TURKEY AND THE OTHER ACCESSION STATES COME INTO THE THERE IS A BALL INEVITABILITY ABOUT THE MONEY THERE'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO YOU KAY I WAS JUST GOING TO GO DOWN THE UNCERTAINTY IS BY HOME MUCH SO
FOR THOSE WHO REMAINED TO TRY AND PROJECT THE ISSUES AS BEING CERTAIN DE NE WITHIN THE AND UNCERTAINTY WITHOUT IS REALLY A TOTAL NONSENSE THERE'S ON CERTAINLY ON EITHER SIDE IS THERE A RELATIVE CERTAINTY THOUGH THAT THERE IS A SECTARIAN DIVIDE IN HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COLLECT CLARE HANNAH WOULD MOST CATHOLICS WOULD BE IN FAVOUR OF FOIL THERE I THINK THE BEAUTY I THINK THE BEAUTY OF THIS ISSUE IS THAT IT IS TOO IMPORTANT TO VIEW THROUGH ANY GREEN OR ORANGE PRISM ON THE FACT THAT THE REMY AND CAMPION IS VERY CROSS COMMUNITY INCLUDES TWO
NATIONALISM TO UNIONIST PARTIES I MEAN IF YOU'RE A NATIONALIST EDWARD COPPER FASTENED PARTITION AND IT WOULD THROW UP ISSUES AROUND THE BORDER AGAIN THAT WE HAVE GOT PAST BUT YOU KNOW FOR A UNIONIST LIKE GREGORY WE THINK OF A BUT IF THE BREAK UP OF THE UNION AS WELL BECAUSE THE SCOTS WOULD INEVITABLY VOTE TO LEAVE IF THE LEADS THAT
POTENTIALLY ON YOUR SHOULDERS GREAT MEET UP WITH WELL I THINK WILL WEAR THAT ARE QUITE WELL NO I MEAN THE SCOTS AND THE SCOTS NATS PARTICULARLY ARE LOOKING FOR ANY EXCUSE TO RE RUN THE SECOND REFERENCE LIKE THAT THAT SIMPLY DOESN'T WASH DO WE WANT AN OUTWARD LOOKING PROGRESSIVE UNITED KINGDOM THAT CAN TRADE FREELY ACROSS THE GLOBE OR DO WE WANT TO STAY WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE THAT ARE GOING TO RESTRICT GROWTH GREGORY CAMPBELL CLAIRE HANNAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MICHELLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE THEY'VE BEEN LONG QUEUES AT PETROL STATIONS IN FRANCE WITH HER REPORTS THAT AROUND HALF OF THE COUNTRY'S TEN THOUSAND HAVE EITHER COMPLETELY OR PARTIALLY RUN OUT OF FUEL AND THAT'S BECAUSE STRIKES HAVE SHUT DOWN MOST OF THE OIL REFINERIES IT'S PART OF A LONG RUNNING BATTLE BETWEEN THE C.G. T. UNION AND THE GOVERNMENT OVER REFORMS TO THE LABOUR LAWS
THE CHANGES TO THE LAW DESIGNED TO BRING DOWN UNEMPLOYMENT BY MAKING IT EASIER AND CHEAPER TO HIRE AND FAR WORKERS ARE BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JONTY BLOOMERS BE ENTERED TO LOSE TO FIND OUT WHY THEY'RE PROVING SO CONTROVERSIAL
WE DO GROUP SO A PROCESS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME NOW IN TOWNS AND CITIES ALL OVER FRANCE HERE INTERLUDES OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL TO THE TOWN HALL IN A GORGEOUS SQUARE ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING IN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT TO PROTEST
AGAINST THESE LABOUR REFORMS ARE DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULDN'T GO AHEAD
AND JUST AS WE THOUGHT THE PROTEST WAS BREAKING UP A GROUP SUDDENLY MADE A DICE FOR THE OPERA HOUSE AND OCCUPIED THE FOYER THEY SEEM PRETTY HAPPY WITH THEMSELVES AND UNFOLD DINERS PROCLAIMING NO CULTURE IT OUT SO
STORMING THE OPERA'S NOT QUITE THE SAME AS STORMING THE BASTILLE BUT THE PROTESTERS INTO LOU'S AS ELSEWHERE IN FRANCE ARE DETERMINED TO KEEP UP THE FIGHT
ONE OF THE CAMPAIGNERS IS FEDERICO HE'S AN ELITE GRADUATE AND HIGHLY SKILLED COMPUTER AND AVIATION EXPERT
BUT HE'S HERE BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THE SYSTEM IN FRANCE IS JUST NOT FAIR IS THE IDEA FROM MEG
BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY PRODUCE IS NUTS
WE CANNOT EXPECT PEOPLE TO LITTLE BEAR
MAKES ME FED UP WITH THIS IT WAS A WAY TO EXPRESS
THAT'S THE REASON THAT THE UNIONS LIKE THIS C.J. TAKE HER SO ADAMANT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT THESE REFORMS TO THE LABOUR LAWS BUT NOT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO PLAN WE MET WITH THE UNION OFFICIAL IN THE RAILWAY STATION AT TOULOUSE DURING A STRIKE WITH ALL THE TRAINS WERE RUNNING ON TIME
ALLY YOU'LL RUE FROM THE SEIZURE TAE UNION WAS NOT PUT OFF HE BELIEVES THEY WILL WIN
WANT TO TRY TO HAVE BEEN A STRUGGLE IF OWEN YOU CHANCE TO WIN BUT WE KNOW A WERE DIFFICULT OR OUR LIFE WILL BE IF ROGER'S TIME
IN FACT HE'S DETERMINED TO TIGHTEN THE LABOUR LAWS FURTHER NOT WEAKEN THEM AND HE WANTS TO REDUCE THE ALREADY VERY GENEROUS THIRTY FIVE HOUR WORKING GREEK TO JUST THIRTY TWO HOURS
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAKES THE LOCAL HEAD OF MEADOW LEFT THE FRENCH BUSINESS LEADERS ORGANISATION ANKY
I THINK THERE CAN'T BE A COMPROMISE WITH THE EU
IT OFF COS I THOUGHT HORSE HE'S REPULSED MEDALS MORE WE'RE IN FRANCE AND I THINK THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL EVEN IN IRAQ GUS TRIGGERED MOST LATELY KEPT ALIVE BY A FAR LEFT THAT'S PREVALENT IN CERTAIN UNIONS AND
HE SAID HE WAS HE MEANS THAT WE HAVE THESE BLOCKADES AND WHERE IT IS CONSIDER THAT FOR INSTANCE ANYTHING DONE TO HER BUSINESS IS SEEN AS A GIFT TO A CHIEF EXECUTIVES THEN WHERE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYERS ARE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE OPPOSED TO THOSE OF EMPLOYEES AT THIS AND AT THE IDEA BUT
HERE IN THE VERY CENTRE OF TOULOUSE LIFE IN FRANCE IS TO BE AS GOOD AS IT'S EVER BEEN
WITH THE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL HAVING AN APERITIF IN THE AFTERNOON SUN BUT IS A DEEP MALAYS AT THE HEART OF THE FRENCH ECONOMY UNEMPLOYMENT IS OVER TEN PER CENT
AND SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS HAVE TRIED AND FAILED
INTRODUCE LABOUR MARKET REFORM
THIS SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT IS LOCKED IN BATTLE WITH THE UNIONS TO TRY TO DO THAT ONCE AGAIN AND IT IS FAR FROM CLEAR WHO IS GOING TO WIN
JONTY BLOOM REPORTING THERE WE'RE JOINED FROM PARIS BY MARIE CHRISTINE NYOTA WHOSE POLICY ADVISER FOR THE C.G. T. UNION WHICH IS LEADING THE ACTION AS WE WERE HEARING THERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THERE EVEN AFTER THE CHAIN PLANNED CHANGES TO THE LAW FRANCE WOULD STILL HAVE THE LOWEST WORKING HOURS IN EUROPE YOUR UNION REPRESENTS JUST THREE PER CENT OF THE WORKFORCE ARE YOU ACTING IN MOST PEOPLE'S ENTRY
WELL IT SEEMS TO US THAT GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT WE'RE GETTING FROM THE POPULATION AT THE MOMENT WITH REGARDS TO THE THIS DRAFT LAW WE ARE INDEED ARE GETTING WE ARE INDEED ON THE RIGHT TRACK OVER SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION IS OPPOSED TO THE NEW TEXT
WE ARE NOT SO MUCH ON THE TRACK TO REDUCING OUR WORKING TIME WEREN'T JUST ON THE TRACK TO AT THE MOMENT AT LEAST KEEPING WORKING TIME TO WATCH IT IS SINCE THE NEW LAW WOULD MEAN
LONGER WORKING HOURS ARE ON THE BASIS OF QUITE COMPLICATED PRINCIPLE WHICH WOULD MEAN
WORKING TIME WOULD BE ANNUALISED OVER THREE YEARS SO PEOPLE EBB STILL BE AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK WITH ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO HER TO ASK STAFF TO WORK LONGER ABSOLUTELY UP AT THE MOMENT THE TEXT MENTIONS UP TO SIXTY HOURS A WEEK IF NEED BE SO AND AT OTHER TIMES I HAD CIRCUMSTANCES ABSOLUTELY YES OBVIOUSLY BUT THEY WOULD MAKE UP FOR IT WITHIN OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD SO IT WOULD AVERAGE THIRTY THREE YEAR PERIOD
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING AND THERE WERE NO HARDLY ANY NEWSPAPER WAS PUBLISHED YESTERDAY YEAH THE IS IT TRUE THAT YOU THREATENED TO BLOCK NEWSPAPER PRODUCTIONS IN THE C.G. DUTY HAS A CONTROL ON ON NEW NEAR MONOPOLY OVER NEWSPAPER DISTRIBUTION UNLESS EDITORS PRINTED YOUR ARTICLE CRITICISING THE REFORMS ABSOLUTELY NOT IT IS DEFINITELY NOT IN THERE
VISION OF A FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION TO TRY AND BLOCK CAN YOU EXPLAIN THEN WHY THE EDITOR OF THE LEFT WING LIBERAL SAID IT WAS BLACKMAIL PURE AND SIMPLE AND THAT'S WHY NATIONAL NEWSPAPER EDITORS CANCELLED YESTERDAY'S PRINT EDITIONS
IT'S ANNIE THERE IS ONE THING YOU SHOULD REMEMBER ARE YOU SORRY YOU MAY KNOW OR NOT HIS DAD TO A PRINT WORKERS ALL
UNION BRANCH UNIONS ARE INDEPENDENT IN THE POLICIES THAT THEY DECIDE TO LEAD
SO IT MAY HAVE HAPPENED BUT YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER IT WE AS A CONSIDERATION AS A NATIONAL CENTRE WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER IT AND YOU WOULD CONDEMN IT IF SOMEBODY HAD DONE THAT
WE WOULD SAY THAT THEY ARE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT TO DECIDE HOW THEY WANT TO PLAY THE GAME AGAINST THERE WERE THERE WERE THERE WERE NO NEWSPAPERS PUBLISHED IN FRANCE YESTERDAY AND IT'S ACCORDING TO THE EDITOR'S IT WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE AT YOUR UNION WAS TRYING TO BLACKMAIL THEM
AND BLACK MALE SEEMS TO ME A BIT OF A STRONG WORD AT THE SAME TIME LET ME SAY THAT I WONDER WHY WHAT IS IT GENERAL UP REGULARLY GENERAL SECRETARY WILL PROPOSE TO VARIOUS NEWSPAPERS ARTICLES AND GENERALLY ONE NEWSPAPER ANOTHER WE PICK IT UP BUT FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER
THIS TIME NO ONE WANTED TO PICK IT UP BUT THAT MAY BE BECAUSE THEY DON'T SUPPORT YOUR ACTION YOU'LL KNOW PERHAPS PERHAPS LESS SURPRISING THEN LIBERACE OF THE FIGURE AT LE FIGARO SAYS THE SEA DUTY IS AGAINST EVERYTHING AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE AGAINST REFORM AGAINST MODERNISATION AGAINST IMPROVEMENT THE GOVERNMENT'S NOW PAYING THE PRICE FOR ITS REPEATED FAILURES TO REIN IN THE ORGANISATION WHICH IS GROWING EVER MORE RADICAL AND VIOLENT
WELL OUR ORGANISATION IS NEITHER RADICAL NOR VIOLENT
I THINK THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DEFEND WHAT WE BELIEVE IS RIGHT WE ARE NOT RADICAL WE ARE NOT A VIOLENT ORGANISATION AND HOW FAR ARE YOU PREPARED TO GO IN TRYING TO DEFEND
WELL WE WILL GO AS FAR AS NEEDED I MEAN WE WE BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION AT THE MOMENT IS TO SCRAP WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSING
AND FINALLY GET EVERYONE AROUND THE TABLE IT IS QUITE SYMPTOMATIC I THINK THAT THE DRAFT BILL WAS FIRST DISTRIBUTED TO THE PRESS BEFORE IT WAS ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTED TO THE VARIOUS UNIONS
AND THERE HAS BEEN TO MEETINGS WITH A GOVERNMENT WITH REGARDS TO DISCUSSIONS ON THE TOPIC YOU CANNOT CALL THAT SOCIAL DIALOGUE ON AN EQUAL BASIS MARIE CHRISTINE NYE OH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME ELEVEN MINUTES TO NINE THE B. B. C.

OUR FIRST QUESTION TONIGHT WILL HAVE A JOB IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. IS STRONG AND WE'RE CREATING MORE JOBS THAN ANY OTHER AS PART OF OUR ARGUMENT
IS THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SO THIS QUESTION OF THE ECONOMY AND WHETHER YOU WOULD BE MORE OR LESS ABLE TO GET A JOB IF WE WERE ALL OUT IS THAT AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN HOW YOU'LL MAKE YOUR DECISION ABOUT HOW TO VOTE NOT REALLY BECAUSE IF YOU GOT A GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE JOB
GOOD JOB REGARDLESS I DON'T THINK THE JOBS MARKET WILL BE AFFECTED BY IN OR OUT I DON'T THINK SO I THINK WE'VE ALREADY GOT A STRUGGLING JOB MARKET AND I THINK THAT IF WE STAY NEAR YOU AND WE HAVE MORE MIGRANTS COMING ACROSS THAT IT'S JUST GOING TO PUT MORE PRESSURE ON HERE MY MUM LIVE IN A COUNCIL HOUSE MY HAVE TO SAVE BOAT AND NEEDS BUNGALOW WHICH THEN I'M IN
AND THEN ONCE A BANKED UP THE LIST BECAUSE OF THIS AM I RIGHT
WE WANT TO ME BASICALLY
WHAT'S THAT STOP YOU AND GET A JOB MAYBE SHE CAN'T GET A JOB HE'S GOT A LOOK DIGBY PONIES A LOOK HAS ALMOST OF A RIVER YOU'RE UNDECIDED ON THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF IN OR OUT BUT THE MIGRATION ISSUE IS NOT THE ISSUE YOU'RE CONSIDERING WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT WHICH WAY TO FIGHT NO NOT AT ALL WE DO SO MUCH WITH YOU
SO MUCH PASSION AROUND THIS QUESTION OF IMMIGRATION THE SHOUTING ACROSS THE HALL IS GOING ON YOU'RE SAYING IT'S YOUR CONCERN AND YOUR FAMILY'S CONCERN IS BECAUSE LIKE IF WE HAVEN'T GOT MOST OF THE HOUSES WE CAN'T HOUSE THEM
WE DON'T LEAVE THEM LES COME OVER SO WE CAN HAVE THE HOUSES BACK IF WE DO STAY IN THE E.U. RIGHT WILL WE LOSE HOUSES AND LOSE JOBS AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE KISS FROM BOOSEY
POSITIVE ARGUMENTS BOTH SIDES YEAH NODS ALL ROUND VICTORIA THANK YOU
YOU GUYS ARE ALL LAUGHING I MEAN SOME OF YOU HAVE DECIDED YOU SAY SOME HAVE BUT ARE YOU CLEAR ABOUT WHAT VOTING IN OR OUT WOULD ACTUALLY MEAN TO BE HONEST IT DOES IT DO YOU KIND OF GET SO MANY DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH SIDES AND WHAT WE DID OTHER ENOUGH FACTS FOR YOU I DON'T KNOW I THINK MY OPINION WHAT CHANGE ON THE FACT
I THINK SAFETY COMES FIRST AND I DO THINK THAT THAT YOU PROVIDE US WITH SAFETY AND SECURITY BUT AT THE MOMENT I MEAN I AM HEARING THE TWO SIDES AND I AM THINKING LIKE HE HAS GOT ME THINKING ABOUT EACH SIDE AND I'M THINKING I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD BE THINKING IF I SHOULD BE AGREEING OR NOT
IF IT HAS REINFORCED THAT OPINION THAT WE SHOULD LEAVE THE E.U.
FROM THE MIGRATION THE HOUSING IF THEY DO COME OVER AND ALL THE MONEY FINANCE BUT I'M STICKING TO MY BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT I BELIEVE AND WHAT I HEAR FROM EVERYBODY AROUND THE SIDE
ONTO THE UNDERSIDE I'M STILL NOT SURE SHOULD I WANNA STAY NICE FOR THE ONE
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GET ABLE TO GIVE YOU A CONCLUSIVE ANSWER EITHER WAY I THINK
MATTHEW PRICE TALKING TO PEOPLE AT LUTON'S BARNFIELD VOCATIONAL COLLEGE THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE WHAT'S UP WITH WHAT SLAP AND INDEED OTHER COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORMS THE HEALTH SERVICE JOURNAL HAS PUBLISHED LEEK LEEKS COMMUNICATIONS FROM WITHIN THE B.M.A. JUNIOR DOCTORS COMMITTEE
THOSE MESSAGES APPARENTLY SENT ON WHAT'S HAPPENED AND THEN PUBLISHED SOME TIME LATER LET'S TALK TO MADGE MEET EMERGED WHO IS HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY AT THE TELEGRAPH JOINS US FROM A BRIAN STUDIO AND FED HIS TAP CLAP WHO IS EDITOR OF THE WEBSITE GADGET DETECTIVE DOT COM MORNING TO YOU BOTH
MORNING MORNING LIGHT CAN WE START WITH WHAT WHAT'S UP IS SOME AND OTHER SIMILAR PLATFORMS WHAT DONE WHAT DID THEY CLAIM
MAGIC ME TO MEASURE ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THEM AND HOW PRIVATE YOUR CONVERSATIONS ON THEM AH
SO WHAT'S UP HE'S A MESSAGING UP IT IS CURRENTLY OWNED BY FACEBOOK AND SO MOST PEOPLE WHO USE IT USE IT TO CHAT BACK AND FORWARD YOU CAN ALSO MAKE VOICE CAUSED THROUGH IT AND RECENTLY THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY LIVE END TO END ENCRYPTED ALL OF THE CONVERSATIONS AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS
PARTIES CAN'T EAVESDROP ON THEIR CONVERSATION BETWEEN ME AND YOU HAPPENING ON
IF THEY WERE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE INTERNET NETWORK OVER WHICH WE WERE COMMUNICATING OR EVEN IF THEY WERE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE TELECOMS COMPANY POWERING THE LINE BETWEEN US AND NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET IN
AND AND READ WHAT WE WERE SAYING BUT I SUPPOSE THE POINT IS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY COULDN'T DO THAT THE OLD FASHIONED THING
THE EQUIVALENT LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER SO THE STUFF IS KEPT IS IT ON AT EACH END AS IT WERE IF THERE IS END TO END ENCRYPTION AT EACH END THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE VULNERABLE AS OUR RIGHT YES THERE ARE OTHER VULNERABILITIES FOR EXAMPLE IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE TO INFECT A PARTICULAR PHONE WITH THE VIRUS SUCH THAT BEFORE IT IS SENT A MESSAGE IS SENT OUT AND THEREFORE ENCRYPTED AT YOUR RENT IT COULD BE SENT TO A THIRD PARTY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO CONSIDER THAT ALTHOUGH
WHAT'S UPSET TO END ENCRYPTION IT IS A GOOD THING HE CAN EXPLAIN THERE ARE MANY OTHER WAYS IN WHICH YOU COULD GET TO THAT DATA THAT DON'T RELATE TO THAT ENCRYPTION LIKE A WHAT
FOR EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH THIS CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN APRIL AND BY THE WAY THESE MESSAGES GO BACK SOME SIX MONTHS A LARGE NUMBER OF THEM WILL PRE DATE THE CHANGE IF YOU HAVE AN UPGRADED YOU'RE APT TO THE LATEST VERSION OF THE APPLE OR THE PERSON YOU'RE SENDING TWO HAS MORE THAN A THE END TO END ENCRYPTION DOESN'T WORK IF YOU ARE I HAVE A CLOUDBASE BACKUP SET UP THEN BECAUSE THE COPY OF THOSE
MESSAGES MAY BE STORED IN A WAY THAT'S NOT ENCRYPTED IN THE SAME WAY SO IT'S SO THERE ARE VARIOUS THINGS AND THEY'RE ALSO ONE OR TWO SETTINGS THAT STILL NEED TO BE TWEAKED TO GET THE TO GET THE BEST OUT OF IT SO IT'S NOT QUITE
THE OUT OF THE BOXING TO END PANACEA OF MADDY HOW DO YOU THINK THE STUFF WAS WAS GOT HOLD OF IN THIS CASE SO THIS IS THE THING YOU CAN YOU CAN HAVE YOU NO TECHNOLOGICAL ENCRYPTION BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
THAT I MEAN THIS IS HUMAN TO HUMAN CONTACT AND SO IN THIS CASE IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS JUST A PURE AND SIMPLE OLD FASHIONED LEE
WHERE THEY RECEIVED A WHOLE BUNCH OF THESE MESSAGES FROM SOMEBODY ON THE INSIDE AND SO WE CAN'T REALLY ACCOUNT FOR THOSE TYPES OF LEEKS AND OFTEN IN A LOT OF CASES WITH YOU KNOW THAT COMPUTER SECURITY ISSUES IT IS INSIDE A THREAT THAT OTHER PROBLEM A DISGRUNTLED EX EMPLOYEES OR PEOPLE WHO DON'T REALISE WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHO DO SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY
THESE HOLES WILL ALWAYS REMAIN AS LONG AS WE HAVE THESE CONTACTS ARE BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT EXACTLY ABOUT THAT CONTACT BETWEEN PEOPLE ARE NOT SORT OF COMPLETELY SAFE IN TERMS OF BEING I HAVE MUCH YOU ENCRYPT THE ACTUAL CONTACT THAT'S THE POINT YEAH WHATEVER STEPS YOU TAKE NO FORM OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION CAN EVER BE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT
SECURE AND PEOPLE USING THESE FORMS OF COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE BEARING THAT IN MIND BEFORE POSTING SENSITIVE MESSAGES TO EACH OTHER AT THAT DON'T DON'T SEND SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT ON THE FRONT PAGE OF A NEWSPAPER BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT MAY AND IN THIS CASE HAS ENDED UP AS A POLITICAL SIDE TO THIS MUDDY MEASURE AND WE HAVE AN ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET HOLD OF COMMUNICATIONS ON PLATFORMS LIKE WHAT'S UP OTHERS AS WELL AND
THAT DOES THIS HAVE A BEARING ON THAT I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT ESPECIALLY WITH THE INVESTIGATORY POWERS BILL CURRENTLY BEING DEBATED BECAUSE SO RECENTLY A STUDY CAME OUT SHOWING
EVEN IF YOU CAN'T LISTEN IN TO SOMEBODY'S CONVERSATION SO YOU CAN'T HEAR THE CONTENT OF THEM YOU CAN YOU CAN EASILY GET THE MATTER DATE AND WHAT THAT MEANS AS I COULD YOU CAN FIND OUT WHO THEY'RE CALLING HOW OFTEN THEY'RE CALLING THEM AND FOR HOW LONG THEY SPEAK TO THEM AND JUST THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION CAN TELL YOU VERY VERY PRIVATE THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE THEY FOUND OUT THAT SOMEONE WAS PREGNANT SOMEBODY HAD
YOU KNOW MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOMEBODY IT WAS AN END STAGES OF CANCER IT AND ACCORDING TO THE LAW CURRENTLY MANY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS CAN ACCESS MATTER DATA WITHOUT A WARRANT
WHICH WHICH I THINK IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO THEIR CONTENT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S ACTUALLY STILL PRIVATE ARE YOU U.K. YET NO ABSOLUTELY THE THE THE DRAUGHTY PESTS COTERIE POWERS BILL ALTHOUGH IT DOES CODIFY SOME ASPECTS OF WHAT SECURITY SERVICE AND POLICE CAN DO AT THE SAME TIME IT DOES EXTEND THEIR POWERS TO ACT IN CERTAIN CASES AS HAS BEEN SAID WITHOUT WARRANTS AND ALSO IT GIVES
POLICE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES THE RIGHTS TO CARRY OUT HACKING INTO INDIVIDUALS COMPUTERS ANT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY A NEW NEW THING IS BULK BULK EQUIPMENT INTERFERENCE SO TO BE ABLE TO SPY ON PEOPLE EN MASSE OH CAME OUT EMITTER MEASURE AND FEDS HE TOOK UP AS WELL THANKS BOTH OUR EDITORS TODAY LOUISE OR LOUISON LAURA COOPER FROM US ALL GOOD MORNING
