LEICESTER CITY ARE CELEBRATING AFTER TAKING THE TOP PRIZE IN ENGLISH FOOTBALL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO YEAR HISTORY THEY SECURED THE PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE LAST NIGHT WHEN THEY'RE ONLY RIVALS TOTTENHAM FAILED TO BEAT CHELSEA THE FOX'S NARROWLY ESCAPED RELEGATION LAST YEAR AND STARTED THE SEASON AS FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE OUTSIDERS AND THE SWISS SENT THIS REPORT FROM LEICESTER
IT WAS A NIGHT THE SO CALLED IMPOSSIBLE DREAM BECAME A GLORIOUS REALITY IS THOUSANDS OF FANS DESCENDED ON LESTER'S KING POWER STADIUM TO CELEBRATE ONE OF SPORT'S MOST REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS
THEY'D WATCH NERVOUSLY ON T. V. AS TOTTENHAM LOOKS FOR A WIN WHICH WOULD PROLONG THE TITLE RACE BUT CHELSEA'S LATE EQUALISER ENDED THEIR HOPES AND FOR THE LESS THE PLAYERS WHO'D GATHERED AT STRIKER JAMIE FRIDAY'S HOUSE IT WAS TIME TO PARTY
BARELY A YEAR AGO LESS THERE WERE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE INDEED MANY TIPPED THEM FOR RELEGATION THIS SEASON BY TURNING THE TRADITIONAL PREMIER LEAGUE HIERARCHY ON ITS HEAD THEY'VE WON HEADLINES AND ADMIRERS AROUND THE WORLD ARGUABLY THE MOST UNLIKELY AND UNFORGETTABLE CHAMPIONS IN FOOTBALLING HISTORY
THOUSANDS OF PARENTS IN ENGLAND ARE EXPECTED TO PULL THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL TODAY IN PROTEST AGAINST NEW TESTS FOR SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS CAMPAIGNERS SAY THEY'RE CREATING STRESS AND ANXIETY AMONG PUPILS THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE TESTS HOLD SCHOOLS TO ACCOUNT AND HAVE NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS RUSSELL HOBBY BELIEVES THEY SHOULD BE REVIEWED
THE TESTS THAT ARE SAT NEXT WEEK FOR THE YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE ONLY ONE ITEM THAT GOES INTO FEEDING ASSESSING THEIR PERFORMANCE ACTUALLY THE RESULTS THAT ARE EVENTUALLY REPORTED TO GOVERNMENTS ARE THE TEACHER JUDGEMENT'S NOT THE TEST RESULTS SO I DON'T THINK IT AFFECTS THE RUNNING OF THE SCHOOL BUT TO GET TO THIS PLACE WHERE YOU'VE GOT TEACHERS YOU'VE GOT HEAD TEACHERS ARE NOW PARENTS SAYING THAT THE TESTING REGIME HAS GONE AWRY I THINK IT NEEDS A RETHINK
A REPORTER'S WARNED THAT CUTS TO THE GOVERNMENT'S FLAGSHIP BENEFITS REFORMING UNIVERSAL CREDIT ARE JEOPARDISING ITS MAIN OBJECTIVE OF ENSURING THAT PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS BETTER OFF IN WORK THE INDEPENDENT THINK TANKS THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION SAYS UNLESS THE FLOORS ARE ERADICATED IT RISKS BEING REDUCED TO LITTLE MORE THAN A VERY COMPLICATED VEHICLE FOR CUTTING THE BENEFITS BILL OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON HAS MORE DETAILS
INTRODUCING UNIVERSAL CREDIT HAS BEEN BESET BY DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION IS NOW CLAIMING THAT BUDGET CUTS RISK UNDERMINING THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF WELFARE REFORM
IT'S A CRITICISM WHICH ECHOES THE CONCERNS OF THE MAN WHO DREAMT UP UNIVERSAL CREDIT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHEN HE RESIGNED FROM THE CABINETS IN MARCH HIS SUCCESSOR AS WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB HAS SAID HE IS COMMITTED TO THE PROJECT BECAUSE IT HELPS CLAIMANTS MOVE INTO WORK FASTER AND EARN MORE
DONALD TRUMP COULD ALL BUT WRAP UP FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION TODAY WITH VICTORY IN THE INDIANA PRIMARIES THE POLLS SUGGEST HE HAS OPENED UP A BIG LEAD WITH HIS CRITICISM OF FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS RESONATING AMONG BLUE COLLAR WORKERS
A U.S. COURT HAS ORDERED THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY JOHNSON AND JOHNSON TO PAY MORE THAN THIRTY SEVEN MILLION POUNDS IN COMPENSATION TO A WOMAN WHO CLAIMS IT TALCUM POWDER CAUSED HER TO DEVELOP OVARIAN CANCER THE FIRM WHICH IS FACING AROUND TWELVE HUNDRED SIMILAR CLAIMS INSISTS ITS PRODUCTS ARE SAFE AND SAYS THAT IT WILL APPEAL

PROVIDING LOANS OR GIFTS OF SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS ON AVERAGE THEY'LL HELP THEIR CHILDREN TO QUALIFY FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORTGAGES THE FIVE BILLION POUND TOTAL MEANS THE BANK OF MUM AND DAD RANKS ALONGSIDE CLYDESDALE BANK AS THE TENTH MOST SIGNIFICANT MORTGAGE LENDER
SIMON COMPASS REPORTING THERE THE TIME NOW IS SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND IT'S TIME TO GO OVER TO THE B.B.C. WEATHER CENTRE WITH PETER GIVES PETER IT'S MIGHTY CHILLY OUTSIDE IN LEICESTER AT THE MOMENT YEAH ABSOLUTELY NECK BUT IT WILL GET WARMER THIS WEEK A PROMISE BUT AS YOU SAY A BIT OF A CHILLY START THIS MORNING FOR MANY THAT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE ACROSS SOUTHERN ENGLAND WALES AND THE MIDLANDS BUT EARLY FROST WILL SOON CLEAR AWAY BISCUITS A FINE DAY FAME OUT OF SUNSHINE TO COME JUST AN ISOLATED AFTERNOON SHOWER TOO

THANK YOU PETER IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX AND IT IS A LEICESTER FIESTA IT'S
IT IS THE MORNING AFTER THE PARTY BEFORE HERE AT THE KING'S POWER STADIUM IN LEICESTER AND YOU COULD HEAR THE EMPTY BOTTLES THE DISCARDED CANS ALL THAT REMAINS OF THE CELEBRATION THAT CARRIED ON UNTIL THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING BEING CLEARED AWAY
NOT OF COURSE THAT THE PARTY IS REALLY OVER NOR WILL IT BE FOR DAYS TO COME AND NOT JUST FOR THE SUPPORTERS OF A FOOTBALL TEAM BUT THE CITIZENS OF A CITY THAT HAS DEFIED THE ODDS AND NOT JUST ANY ODDS ODDS THAT PUT LEICESTER CITY AT FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE TO WIN FOOTBALL'S PREMIER LEAGUE
THE TEAM OF COURSE DIDN'T ACTUALLY PLAY LAST NIGHT BUT THEY AND EVERYONE HELD THEIR BREATHS AS THE ONLY TEAM THAT COULD CATCH THAT
TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR DID BUT SPURS LETTER TO NEIL LEAD HER DREAMS OF GLORY SLIP FROM THEIR GRASP A TWO ALL DRAW WITH CHELSEA MADE IT MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO STOP LEICESTER BEING CROWNED CHAMPIONS
THERE WAS OF COURSE QUITE A LOT OF SCREAMING AND SHOUTING HERE ESPECIALLY AT STAR STRIKER JAMIE VODDY T'S HOUSE WHERE THE PLAYERS GATHERED TO WATCH THE SPURS GAME HERE'S HOW THEY REACTED AT THE FINAL WHISTLE
IT IS FAIR TO SAY
THAT THE FANS OF LEICESTER CITY WERE PRETTY HAPPY TOO
THAT THE SOUND OF FUNDS CHANTING HERE AT THE KING POWER STADIUM OUTSIDE LEICESTER CITY FOOTBALL CLUB LATE LATE INTO THE NIGHT THEIR CHANT WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE CHAMPIONS OF ENGLAND WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE GARY LINEKER IS SUPPORTED LEICESTER CITY SINCE HE WAS A BOY AND WARS UNTIL NOW ITS MOST FAMOUS EVER PLAYER
I CAN'T I CAN'T GET MY HEAD ROUND IT I JUST THINK HE'S GENUINELY THE BIGGEST SPORT IN SHOCK IN PROBABLY SPORT THING IS I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THAT'S A PASS IS IT IN TERMS OF THE TEAM THIS IS JUST SOMETHING ELSE THIS IS THIS IS ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE I I WOULDN'T THERE WERE NO ODDS THAT I WOULD HAVE TAKEN AT THE START OF THE SEASON NO ODDS YOU COULD GIVE ME TEN MILLION TO ONE I SAID NOW JUST WASTING A QUID JUST TO ENJOY THIS MOMENT ESPECIALLY WITH A FAMILY AND
AND IT JUST SPOKE TO MY DAD AND HE CAN'T KICK UP IF IT'S JUST IN CREDIT
HE CAN'T BELIEVE IT BUT HE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BELIEVE THAT LINEKER JUDEA HAS PROMISED TO PRESENT MATCH OF THE DAY IN HIS UNDIES SO SURPRISED WAS HE BY WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHY ARE WE GOING ON ABOUT THIS EVENT IN SPORTING HISTORY IF YOU'RE NOT A FOOTBALL FAN YOU MAY FIND IT ALL A BIT PUZZLING WILL THINK OF THIS THEN AT THE START OF THE SEASON THE BOOKIES WERE OFFERING SHORTER ODDS ON DAVID CAMERON BECOMING MANAGER
OF ASTON VILLA THEY WERE PUTTING ON ALEX FERGUSON WINNING STRICTLY COME DANCING SHORTER ODDS ON ELVIS BIG DISCOVERED ALIVE AND WELL EVEN ON JEREMY CORBIN WILLING BIG PROPER IT IS IN OTHER WORDS THE ULTIMATE UNLIKELY UNDERDOG STORY AND AS A RESULT HE'S ON EVERY FRONT PAGE NOT
JUST RELEGATED TO THE BACK PAGES SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE MORNING PAPERS AT TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX
THEIR SONS FROM PAGE BLUE DOT IT IS THEIR HEADLINE AND EVERY PAPER HAS THEIR VERSION OF THE GUARDIAN CAUGHT CATCHES MY EYE BUT OF COURSE LESTER WAS IN THE NEWS ONLY LAST YEAR WHEN RICHARD THE THIRD WAS BURIED HERE SO IT HAS THE HEADLINE THE GUARDIAN LEICESTER CITY KINGS OF ENGLAND AND STEPHEN MOSS OF REIMAGINED RICHARD THIRD DOFFING HIS CAP TO THIS CITY
THE BURIAL OF HIS MACE IN HIS MOST FAMOUS SHAKESPEAREAN SPEECH NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER BY THIS CHAMPIONSHIP IT GOES ON SINCE LESTER WAS MY FINAL RESTING PLACE
FOLLOWING MY REVERSE AT BOSWORTH FIELD THE FOXES OR BECOME MY SECOND LOVE
A STEADY PASSION FOR MY VULPINE WAYS AND AFTER LAST YEAR'S FIGHT WITH RELEGATION HOW SWEET THE PLAUDITS OF THE SMITTEN NATION I AM NOT A LOST SARAH TO THE SHAKESPEAREAN STAGE
THE MAIN STORY FOR THE GUARDIAN THOUGH AS WITH THE TIMES IS THE GOVERNMENT'S FIGHT AGAINST HIS ISLAMIST EXTREMISM WITH THE COT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT'S A COVERT FIGHTER AT LEAST IN PART AND THAT HUGE SUMS OF MONEY ARE BEING SPENT ON INITIATIVES WHICH AREN'T CLEAR THAT THEY ARE BACKED BY THE GOVERNMENT INCLUDING LEAFLETS FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'RE HELPING REFUGEES IN SYRIA BUT UNAWARE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATIONS PARTICULATE UNIVERSITIES AT THE TIME SAYS IT'S GOOD THE COVENANT CAMERON WILL BE
PUTTING ISLAMIST EXTREMISM THE CURBING A BIT AT THE HEART OF THE QUEEN'S SPEECH THIS MONTH AS HE IN THE WORDS OF THE TIME SEEKS TO FEND OFF CLAIMS HE'S BECOMING A LAME DUCK PRIME MINISTER THE TELEGRAPH IT'S FOCUS ITS LEAD STORIES THAT LABOUR SUSPENDS FIFTY FOR RACISM SUGGESTING THAT SECRETLY SUSPENDED THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE OVER ANTI SEMITIC AND RACIST COMMENTS AS OFFICIAL STRUGGLE TO CONTAIN THE CRISIS ENGULFING THE PARTY IS HOW THE TELEGRAPH PUTS IT
WORTH MENTIONING A STORY THAT IS ON THE FRONT OF THE GUARDIAN AS WELL WHICH IS A STORY IN FRANCE HAVE A FRENCHMAN WHO HAS TAKEN HIS EMPLOYED TO WORK BECAUSE HE SAYS HE SUFFERED BORA OUT WHICH IS EVEN IN THE FRENCH CASE THEY USE THE ENGLISH PHRASE BORE OUT HE CLAIMS THAT HIS MANAGERIAL JOB AT A PERFUME COMPANY WHICH MADE HIM REDUNDANT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO
WAS SO TEDIOUS HE BECAME EXHAUSTED AND BORED OUT OF HIS MIND AND HE'S CLAIMING UP TO NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS IN COMPENSATION AND DAMAGES BECAUSE HE SAYS THE DESCENT INTO HELL WAS SIMILAR TO A BURN
NOT SURE IF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WILL CATCH ON IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST SIX AND THE OLYMPIC FLAME ARRIVES IN BRAZIL TODAY FOR ITS THREE MONTH RELAY AROUND THE COUNTRY BEFORE THE GAME START WE'RE DAVIES IS A SOUTH AMERICA CORRESPONDENT
TODAY IS THE DAY THAT THE OLYMPICS REALLY ARRIVES IN BRAZIL THE TORCH ARRIVES HERE FROM ATHENS VIA SWITZERLAND NINETY FIVE DAYS TO GO AND THE TAUGHT ITSELF WILL GO AROUND THIS HUGE COUNTRY HE CARRIED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE INCLUDING THEIR SYRIAN REFUGEES WHO LIVE HERE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
GREAT BRAZILIAN SPORTSMEN AND SPORTSWOMEN BUT THE FIRST RECIPIENT OF THE TORCH WILL BE BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT GEMMA OR SETH AND THE IRONY IS OF COURSE THAT IT COULD BE ONE OF HER LAST DUTIES AS PRESIDENT BECAUSE NEXT WEEK SHE'S LIKELY GONNA FACE PETERMAN VOTE IN THE SENATE AND SHE WILL HAVE TO STEP ASIDE WHILE SI'S FORMALLY TRIED ON IMPEACHMENT CHARGES IN THE SENATE AND IT REALLY SUMS UP THE WAY THINGS HAVE GONE FOR PRESIDENT RECESS AND BRAZIL IN RECENT YEARS THE ECONOMY IS IN A MESS IS A BIG POLITICAL CRISIS HERE
AND OF COURSE THE TRYING TO WELCOME THE WORLD FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND THE PROBLEM IS NOBODY REALLY IN BRAZIL ON UP NOT NOBODY BUT NOT MANY PEOPLE IN BRAZIL SEEMED TO BE ENTHUSED ABOUT THE GAMES BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS OF PERHAPS THE TORCH IS THE MOMENT FOR BRAZIL TO GET BEHIND THE OLYMPICS CAN THE GAMES GO ON QUITE HAPPILY QUITE SUCCESSFULLY WHATEVER THE STATE OF POLITICS IN THE COUNTRY
YEAH I KNOW I THINK THE GAMES WOULD BE A SUCCESS BECAUSE THE SPORTING VENUES HAVE BEEN FINISHED IN MANY WAYS IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TELEVISION AUDIENCE TICKET SALES ARE DISAPPOINTINGLY LOW AND THAT WILL BE UPSETTING FOR NOT JUST FOR THE BRAZILIANS BUT OF COURSE FOR THOSE BIG T. V. COMPANIES WORLDWIDE WHO HAVE PUMPED LOTS OF MONEY AND IF THAT REMAINS THE CASE IN AUGUST WHEN THE GAMES START BUT THE GAMES THEMSELVES WILL HAPPEN I THINK THE PROBLEM FOR BRAZIL IS THAT THE
THE DIVIDEND FOR BRAZIL HASN'T REALLY HAPPENED ALL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BENEFITS THEY WERE MEANT TO COME ALONG IN RIO IN PARTICULAR THINGS LIKE TRANSPORT SANITATION AT THE POLICEMEN HAVE GONE A BAR OBEY ALL OF THAT WAS MEANT TO BE SORTED OUT AS PART OF THE OLYMPIC DEAL AND THAT HASN'T REALLY HAPPENED SO IN THE EYES SEE THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE WHEN IT AWARDS COUNTRY GAMES IT'S MEANT TO
DEMAND THESE EXTRA EXTRA MILE THESE EXTRA YARDS AS WELL AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IN BRAZIL WHERE A DAVIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX TIME FOR THE BUSINESS NEWS HERE IS THEY'RE LIKE IT MORE INTO GOOD MORNING H.S.B.C. THE EUROPEAN BANKERS REPORTED NET PROFIT FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE YEAR DROPPED FROM
FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THE COMPANY SAID THE RESULTS COMPARE WITH A VERY STRONG QUARTER A YEAR AGO H.S.B.C. IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A MAJOR COST CUTTING DRIVE SHEDDING JOBS AND CLOSING LESS IMPORTANT PARTS OF ITS BUSINESS IS ALSO FOCUSING ON ITS ACTIVITIES IN ASIA I'M JOINED NOW BY PETER HAHN PROFESSOR OF BANKING AT THE INSTITUTE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES THE FORMER BANKER HIMSELF GOOD MORNING MORNING
PROFITS FALLING BUT MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS EXPECTED IS THIS A CASE OF GLASS HALF FULL OR HALF EMPTY WELL I THINK GENERALLY IT'S QUITE FAVOURABLE FREIGHTERS B. C. THE PREDICTIONS THAT I SWALLOW WORST WEEK WERE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS FOR ABSENCE THAN MANAGING EXPECTATIONS BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH H.S.B.C. IS SHRINKING IT'S BOOK OF BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA
OBVIOUSLY THEY GOT SOMETHING OUT OF BRAZIL AND MOVING GOT A GROWTH A LITTLE BIT OF GROWTH IN EUROPE THAT TOO BAD IN IN ASIA INVESTMENT BANKING THAT TOO BAD SO EIGHT B. C. SEEMS TO BE EXECUTING ON ITS STRATEGY OF FOCUSING MORE ON ASIA
INTERESTING POINT THERE AS THE INVESTMENT BANK I MEAN IT IS SUFFERING BUT AGAIN NOT AS MUCH AS EXPECTED DESPITE ALL THE MARKET TURBULENCE WE HAD EARLIER THIS YEAR AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS PEERS ARE SUFFERING WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT LOOKS LIKE EATERS B. C. HIS INVESTMENT
HE'S A LOT MORE FOCUSED ON CLIENT BUSINESS THEN IT IS PURELY ON BEING A MARKET MAKER WHICH SOME OF THE LARGER U.S. INVESTMENT BANKS THEN MORE OF THEIR TIME REALLY MAKING FOR MARKETS AND SECURITY SO REDUCED TRADING ACTIVITY HAS REALLY HURT THEY'RE MUCH MORE
IT'S AN ASSESSMENT OF COURSE NOW H.S.B.C. HEAVILY FOCUSED ON ASIA IN PARTICULAR CHINA TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CAN ACT AS A BELLWETHER FOR WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHINA TO A SICKNESS WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THESE FIGURES ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHINA
EH JUST BE C. LOOKS IT DOES AGAIN IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S TWO BEDS DONE POORLY IN TRYING HEADS LOOKS LOOKS QUITE POSITIVE BUT I THINK WHAT IT IS WE SEE THE GENERAL LOSE OF CHINESE BANKING ISSUES AND CHINESE BANKING CHINESE BANKS HAVE HAD A WIDER BERTH LENDING TO STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES LADS HAVE CREDIT ISSUES THAT ARE STARTING TO RISE TO THE TOP WAS H.S.B.C. IS WHAT MORE EXPOSED TO THE NINE STATE SECTOR WHICH IS PROBABLY HEALTHIER
NEVERTHELESS THIS FOCUS ON CHINA IS A RISK ISN'T IT IT IS A RISK I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS A BANK THAT IS DIFFERENTIATING ITSELF IT'S BECOMING HASN'T SAID MORE OF I THINK THE WORLD WAS PIPIT TO ASIA WAS THERE THE LIST FREE AND SO ON
AS BANKS WERE ALL THE SAME MANY YEARS AGO TRYING TO BE EVERYWHERE EVERYTHING TO EVERYONE TODAY IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT BE C. IS BECOMING MUCH MORE DEPENDENT ON ASIA NOW WE LOOK AT
THE DEVELOPING WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL THEM TODAY I'D ALMOST SAY A NUMBER OF WHAT WE USED CALLED BRIC COUNTRIES ARE ACTUALLY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ROUGHLY DEVELOPING ECONOMIES IT'S NOT AS SMOOTH AS WE'VE GOT AND THERE'S MORE RISK IN THOSE SO POTENTIAL FOR MORE REWARDED BUT ALSO THAT OF A STUDY A RIDE
OH KAY NOW H.S.B.C. HAS HAD ITS FAIR SHARE OF LEGAL PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND IT SAID LAST YEAR IT'S BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE U.S. AUTHORITIES OVER THE HIRING OF PEOPLE REFERRED BY OR RELATED TO SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN CHINA AND JUST HOW MUCH OF A RISK IS THAT TO H.S.B.C. AND OTHER ANY OTHER SKELETONS IN THE CLOSET THE WHAT WE'RE LIKELY TO HEAR
I THINK WE'RE NOT YET AT THE END OF WHAT WE CALL THE THE CONDUCT RIDE WHICH IS WAS BUSINESS UNDERTAKING THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEET STANDARDS OR EXIST TODAY AND IT'S NOT JUST AN ISSUE FOR H. S. P. C. MANY OF THE U.S. BANKS HAVE ALSO SUFFERED HERE I THINK THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE
CHARGES FOR CONDUCT ISSUES THIS BROAD RANGE OF HAVE THEY DONE BUSINESS CORRECTLY ANITA'S B. C. SEEM TO HAVE GONE DOWN SO THEY'RE HAVING PRISON PROVISIONED MORE MONEY YOU WERE IX DOESN'T APPEAR THERE EXPECTING MORE FINDS SO GO BACK TO MY FIRST QUESTION JUST QUICKLY GLASS HALF FULL GLASS HALF EMPTY
I THINK THIS IS A PRETTY FAVOURABLE REVIEW FOR EACH HAS B. C. I THINK THE MARKET I'M NOT UNLIKE A PERSON I THINK YOU'LL BE AT THE MOMENT I THINK THE MARKET WILL REACT FAVOURABLY THANKS VERY MUCH PETER AND WE DO HAVE OUR MARKETS PERSON WITH US MARKETS ANALYST CHRIS RALPH CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SAINT JAMES'S PLACE CHRIS FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON H. A SPECIES RESULTS
WELL I THINK I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID WHAT'S FASCINATING TO ME IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY IN WHICH STUART GULLIVER AND DOUGLAS WENT HAVE BEEN WE ORGANISE IN THE DISTANCE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THEY'VE REDUCED THE COUNTRY FOOTPRINT FROM EIGHTY EIGHT COUNTRIES TO SEVENTY ONE THEY'VE THEY'VE PULLED OUT OF EIGHTY BUSINESSES THIS IS THIS IS AN ORGANISATION THAT'S TRYING TO CUT COSTS AND TRYING TO ORGANISE IT'S BIG BUSINESS IN INTO A BETTER SHAPE
I AGREE WITH A PREVIOUS SPEAKER THAT I CAN'T SEE WHY THE MARKET SHOULD REACT UNFAVOURABLY TO TO THE SET OF RESULTS THERE'S OBVIOUSLY AS I'M SURE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A WHOLE SLEW OF BANKING RESULTS COMING OUT TODAY AND DURING THE WEEK
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SLEW OF BANKING RESULTS IN ONE OF THOSE IS THERE'S ALREADY REPORTED IT'S U. B'S THE SWISS BANKING GIANT THOSE RESULTS NOT SO GOOD NO THE WORK THEY WEREN'T SO GOOD THE FIRST QUARTER PROFIT FELL BY SIXTY FOUR PERCENT MED NETTIE NET INCOME FELL TO SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN BILLION SWISS FRANCS THEY TALKED ABOUT HEIGHTENED CHEER POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY
IF YOU BREAK LOOK LOOK DOWN IN THE UNDERLYING DIVISIONS ONE OF THINGS THAT YOU GUESS HAS BEEN BETTER THAN ITS SWISS COUNTERPARTS SOMEONE LIKE CREDIT SAYS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS WEALTH MANAGEMENT BUSINESS AND IT'S SAW IN FLOWS OF FOOT FIFTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION SWISS FRANCS
INTO ITS WEALTH MANAGEMENT IN BUSINESS BUT IN TERMS OF ASSET MANAGEMENT HER CONVENTIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SO OUTFLOWS OF FIVE POINT NINE BILLION INCREDIBLY ONE SINGLE INVESTOR APPARENTLY PULLED OUT SEVEN POINT TWO FIVE MILLION SWISS FRANCS BECAUSE THEY DISAGREE WITH THE COMPANY'S GONE PRICING FASCINATED
THAT'S AN EXPENSIVE DIFFERENCE IN VIEWS OF COURSE THE SWISS FRANC THE LEVEL OF THE SWISS FRANC IS ALSO PRETTY HERE ISN'T IT WELL OF COURSE IT IS AND IT'S NOT A LOT OF THE SWISS FRANC BUT IT'S THE NEGATIVE INTO STRAIGHT ENVIRONMENT IN IN SWITZERLAND WHICH IS MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER FOR THE SWISS BANKS TO TO TO MAKE PROFIT ALSO THE FACT THAT THE SWISS BANKS OF U.B.S. AND CREDIT SWISS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN VERY VERY MUCH AT THE HEART OF INVESTMENT BANKING INDUSTRY AND THEY'RE PULLING OUT OF THAT MORE WAS MANAGEMENT
O.K. LET'S MOVE ON FROM BANKING THE LATEST U.K. PURCHASING MANAGES INDEX FIGURES ARE OUT SHORTLY THEY'RE A GOOD INDICATOR OF THE HEALTH OF THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR WOODY EXPECTING TO HEAR WE'VE GOT TWO SETS OF WHAT A COOL PERSON MANAGES INDEX SURVEYS THIS WEEK SO WE'VE GOT THE MANUFACTURING ONCE AND THEN THE SERVICING ONES LATER IN THE WEEK I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY SEE A SLIGHT FALL OR MAYBE AN UNCHANGED FIGURE FOR THE FOR THE MANUFACTURING MANUFACTURING SECTOR
BUT IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE IN THE SERVICES SECTOR WHERE WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE SEEING SEEING GROWTH OBVIOUSLY WITH THE WEAKER STIRLING THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR THIS YEAR WAS AS INVESTORS HAVE BECOME SLIGHTLY MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A BRECK SAID HAS MADE IT BETTER FOR EXPORTERS IT'S A BETTER MARKETS FOR EXPORTERS
SO THAT'S THAT'S HELPED HELP COMPANIES IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO THE GLOBAL PICTURE COS IN THE U.S. MANUFACTURING GROWING SLOWLY DECLINING IN CHINA GLOBAL PICTURE MAYBE NOT SO GOOD THAT THE U.S. PICTURE YOU S. IS IN PROBABLY SLIGHTLY BETTER SHAPE THAN THAN THE U.K. IN TERMS OF ITS IN TERMS OF IT PIERRE MY DATA AGAIN WE'RE GETTING DATA ON THAT LATER ON ON ON THE WEEK
IT'S BEEN MUCH MORE DRIVEN BY NON FINANCIAL SERVICES RATHER THAN FINANCIAL SERVICES THERE IS AN END IT GOES BACK TO THE STATEMENT THAT U.B.S. WAS MAKING THERE WAS GROWING GEO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY OTHER
CHRIS THANKS VERY MUCH THAT WAS CHRIS RALPH CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE OF SAINT JAMES'S PLACE NOW THERE'S A BANK OUT THERE WHICH LENDS FIVE BILLION A YEAR PROVIDING DEPOSITS FOR MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORTGAGES AND HELPING TO BUY HOMES WORTH SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS A YEAR BUT YOU WON'T FIND IT ON THE HIGH STREET I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BANK OF MUM AND DAD THE UNOFFICIAL LENDER WHICH IS HELPING A GENERATION OF WOULD BE HOMEOWNERS GET ON THE HOUSING LADDER
ACCORDING TO RESEARCH BY LEGAL AND GENERAL AND THE FINANCIAL RESEARCH GROUP SEE IT WILL HAVE A ROLE IN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL U.K. MORTGAGE TRANSACTIONS THIS YEAR WELL I'M JOINED NOW BY NIGEL WILSON WHO IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF LEGAL AND GENERAL GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SO TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN BRITAIN AND EVERYBODY RECOGNISES THE HOUSE PRICE INFLATION HAS BEEN TOO HIGH FOR TOO LONG WE'VE GOT A HUGE SUPPLY SIDE PROBLEM WHERE WAS SIMPLY NOT PRODUCING ENOUGH HOUSES MAYBE A HUNDRED TWENTY HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND THIS YEAR WHEN WE NEED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PIP ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IS THAT MUM AND DAD ARE HAVING TO STEP UP AND IT ESSENTIALLY GIVE TO THEIR CHILDREN
OVER FIVE BILLION POUNDS THE HSC IS COMING MUCH OF WHICH IS JUST A GIFT AND IN LONDON IT REPRESENTS FIFTY PER CENT OF THE NET WEALTH OUTSIDER HOUSING SO IT'S A REAL ONEROUS DEMAND ON PARENTS RIGHT NOW
AND LOOKING AT THE FIGURES THE AVERAGE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION IS SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS OR SEVEN PER CENT OF THE AVERAGE PURCHASE PRICE THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY IT IS EXTRAORDINARY AND IN LONDON IT'S OBVIOUSLY EVEN WORSE THERE'S OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TRANSACTIONS THIS YEAR IT SORT OF CREPT UP ON US WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT PARENTS HAVE HELPED BUT THE HELPING IN A REALLY MATERIAL RIGHT NOW AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE HOUSING MARKET THAT THIS IS HAPPENING ON THE SCALE THAT IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
IT'S ALL VERY WELL IF YOU HAVE PARENTS WITH SPARE CASH ISN'T IT BUT FOR THOSE WHO DON'T IT LOOKS AS THOUGH OWNING A HOME IS BECOMING EVER MORE DIFFICULT THAT'S EXACTLY IT'S A VERY GOOD POINT ON THE INTER GENERATIONAL UNFAIRNESS IS HUGE BUT ACTUALLY BETWEEN THE GENERATIONAL UNFAIRNESS IS INCREASING ALL THE TIME I SUPPOSE PARENTS WHO HAVE
TRYING VERY HARD TO GET CHILDREN ON THEM ON THE HOUSING LADDER THOSE WHO HAVEN'T HAVE GOT LITTLE OR NO CHANCE AND THE INTER REGIONAL DIFFERENCE IF YOU IF YOU ARE LIVING IN THE NORTH AND TRYING TO GET YOUR CHILDREN A HOUSE IN THE CELLS IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE RIGHT NOW FOR PARENTS
AND IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY SUSTAINABLE OF THIS DOESN'T IT NO IT'S NOT A SUSTAINABLE PART OF THE HOUSING MARKET IT'S GREAT THE PARENTS ARE WILLING TO DO THIS AND I THINK AS PARENTS WE ALL WANT TO HELP OUR CHILDREN AND IT'S AN ADMIRABLE RESPONSE FROM SOCIETY BUT IT'S NOT A GOOD RESPONSE WE'VE HAD A FAILURE OF HOUSING POLICY FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IN BRITAIN WE HAVE TO COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY WE MANAGE THE SUPPLY SIDE AT NEW MODERN CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES INTO THE INDUSTRY SO WE COULD MASS PRODUCE HOUSES ON A SCALE THAT WE SAW IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES
SO THAT IS THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND WE JUST NEED TO GET BUILDING MORE HOUSES BUT WE NEED TO GET BUILDING THEN AS OPPOSED TO THE TWO MAYORAL CANDIDATES TALKING ABOUT THINKING ABOUT BILL DILLING THEN WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY BUILD FIFTY THOUSAND HOUSES IN LONDON AND REPLICATE THAT SUCCESS RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT THE MOMENT THERE'S NO PLANS FOR DOING THAT THAT'S JUST TALK
AND OUTSIDE LONDON JUST QUICKLY I THINK THE SAME IN THE TOWN THIS MORNING MEETING THE MAYOR AND HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE HOW WEAK WE ARE LEGAL AND GENERAL CAN DO MORE TO HELP THEM BUILD MORE HOUSES IN THE U.K. NIGEL WILSON CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS LEGAL AND GENERAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

DONALD TRUMP HAS TOLD HIS SUPPORTERS THAT IF HE WINS THE INDIANA PRIMARY BEING HELD LATER TODAY THEN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION WILL BE HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE HIS RIVAL'S SENATOR TED CRUISE CONCEDE IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO BLOCK MISTER TRUMP IF HE WINS IN INDIANA
A JURY IN THE AMERICAN STATE OF MISSOURI HAS ORDERED THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY JOHNSON AND JOHNSON TO PAY NEARLY FORTY MILLION POUNDS TO A WOMAN WHO SAID THAT USING ITS TALCUM PRODUCTS CAUSED HER TO DEVELOP OVARIAN CANCER THE FIRM IS FACING TWELVE HUNDRED SIMILAR LAWSUITS IT SAYS THAT IT WILL APPEAL AND INSISTS ITS PRODUCTS ARE SAFE
AND RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE GAP IN LIFE EXPECTANCY BETWEEN THE RICHEST AND THE POOREST MEN IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS GROWING FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES ACADEMICS AT CITY UNIVERSITY IN LONDON FOUND THAT WHILE EVERYONE WAS LIVING LONGER DIFFERENCES IN LIFESTYLE ACCOUNTED FOR A WIDER GAP IN LONGEVITY OF MEN IN DIFFERENT SOCIO ECONOMIC GROUPS
IT'S NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT'S FLAGSHIP REFORM OF OUR BENEFITS SYSTEM UNIVERSAL CREDIT IS BEING INTRODUCED TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS BETTER OFF IN WORK THAN ON BENEFITS BUT I THINK TANKS WARNED THAT THAT MAY NO LONGER BE THE CASE THAT IT IS VEERED OFF TRACK BECAUSE OF COST CUTTING NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR
NORMAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THINK TANK THAT'S RUN BY A FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTER YES DAVID WILLETTS THE FORMER UNIVERSITIES MINISTER AND HIS THINK TANK TODAY VERY FIRMLY POINTS THE FINGER OF BLAME AT THE TREASURY FOR REPEATED COST CUTTING OF UNIVERSAL CREDIT WHICH THEY SAY MEANS THAT IT HAS BECOME A VEHICLE FOR CURBING THE BENEFITS BILL
RATHER THAN A WAY OF INCENTIVISING PEOPLE OFF BENEFITS AND INTO WORK AND THEY SAY THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON PRETTY MUCH SINCE UNIVERSAL CREDIT WAS FIRST DREAMT UP IN TWENTY TWELVE IN SUCCESSIVE BUDGETS CULMINATING IN THE LAST BUDGET WHEN A WHOPPING THREE BILLION POUNDS WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE UNIVERSAL CREDIT BUDGET BY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH THE RESULT IT IS ESTIMATED BY THE O.B. ARE THERE AROUND TWO AND A HALF MILLION FAMILIES WILL BE ON AVERAGE AROUND TWO THOUSAND POUNDS WORSE OFF A YEAR
AND THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION SAY THOSE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN NOW A SINGLE PARENTS SECOND OWNERS AND PART TIME WORK AS THOSE WHO HAVE NOT RETURNED TO WORK BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THE WORKING AGE POPULATION REACHED RECORD HIGH BUT STILL THAT GROUP HAVE NOT RETURNED TO WORK AND THAT IT IS ARGUED IS BECAUSE THEY ARE MOST RESPECT RESPONSIVE TO CASH INCENTIVES AND THEY CALCULATE THAT IF YOU HAD A SINGLE PARENT RETURNING TO PART TIME WORK ON THE MINIMUM WAGE EARNING
ROUND ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR THEY WERE ACTUALLY ONLY BE AROUND ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS BETTER OFF BECAUSE THEY WOULD LOSE SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF THEIR BENEFIT ENTITLEMENTS NOW THE GOVERNMENT SAY WILL HANG ON A SEC THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION HAVEN'T TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE THIRTY HOURS OF FREE CHILDCARE WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS INTRODUCING BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE QUESTION MARKS ROUND UNIVERSAL CREDIT OR NOT JUST IN RELATION TO ITS FINANCIAL UNDERPINNING
THERE ARE ALSO STILL PROFOUND DOUBTS ABOUT ITS DELIVER ABILITY BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT IS GOING TO BE ROLLED OUT FROM TODAY TO EVERY JOB CENTRE UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY THAT WILL ONLY APPLIED TO NEW CLAIMANTS AND TO THOSE ON JOBSEEKER'S ALLOWANCE ALONE THAT AMOUNTS TO WHAT AROUND I THINK ABOUT QUARTER OF A MILLION
CLAIMANTS WHEN UNDER THE ORIGINAL PROJECTIONS PUT FORWARD BY MISTER DUNCAN SMITH IT WAS INVENTED BY NEXT YEAR THEY WOULD BE SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE ON UNIVERSAL CREDIT WAS JUST SHOWS HOW FAR ADRIFT IT STILL IS AND OF COURSE THIS IS WE'VE GOT THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION SAYING THIS BUT IT IT'S AN ECHO REALLY OF WHAT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH SAID ON HIS DEPARTURE ALL THOSE DEPARTURE WAS ALSO FOR OTHER REASONS AND
IT RAISES QUESTIONS AGAIN WHETHER UNIVERSAL CREDIT IS STILL GOING TO GO AHEAD WITH LABOUR SAYING LOOK WE NEED A ROOT AND BRANCH REVIEW CERTAINLY FROM THE INITIAL COMMENTS BY THE NEW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY HE IS AS EVANGELICAL AS IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WAS ABOUT A PROJECT WHICH WAS HIS BABY BASICALLY BUT
STEPHEN CRAB JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WAS SAYING HOW HE VIEWED UNIVERSAL CREDIT AS THE SPINE OF THE BENEFIT SYSTEM HARRY REGARDED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM OF THE PAST TEN YEARS AND HOW HE WAS ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO IT AND I THINK IN PART THAT IS NOT JUST FOR IDEOLOGICAL REASONS BUT ALSO TO SOME EXTENT HIS OWN PERSONAL STORY AND HE'S TALKED ABOUT THIS HOW HIS MUM WHO WAS A SINGLE PARENT
CAME OFF BENEFITS AND GRADUALLY FOUND HER WAY BACK INTO WORK AND HOW THAT UNDERLINED TO HIM THE CENTRAL OR TEA OF WORK ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE HE'S TALKING ABOUT ANY MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH IN GOVERNMENT I TAKE IT FROM THAT HE MEANS WORKING WITH THE TREASURY MORE BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF MY DUNCAN SMITH'S DIFFICULTIES WAS HIS RELATIONS WITH THE CHANCELLOR WERE TO SAY THE LEAST NOT THE MOST HARMONIOUS AND THE HOPE I THINK OF MY CRAB IS HE WILL HAVE BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE TREASURY WILL BE SPEAKING TO HIM ABOUT IT AT TWENTY PAST EIGHT THIS MORNING NORMAN SMITH THANKS VERY MUCH

PRAYERS ARE LED BY BUDDHIST MONKS BEFORE EVERY HOME GAME AND THE BURIAL OF KING RICHARD THE THIRD WITH FULL HONOURS IN LEICESTER CATHEDRAL AROUND THE SAME TIME THEIR FIGHT BACK FROM RELEGATION
THE SUN'S ALSO QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT THE CLUB'S REVERSAL OF FORTUNE COINCIDED WITH THE REBURIAL OF THE ANCIENT REMAINS WHICH WERE DISCOVERED UNDER A CAR PARK STEPHEN MOSS IN THE GUARDIAN IMAGINES SHAKESPEARE'S VERSION OF THE PLANTAGENET KING PAYING TRIBUTE WITH AN ALTERNATIVE MONOLOGUE ALONG THE LINES OF NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER BY THIS CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER LAST YEAR FIGHT WITH RELEGATION HER SWEET THE PLAUDITS OF THE SMITTEN NATION AND IT GOES ON

GAG INDIVIDUALS AND CLOSE DOWN PREMISES FOUND TO BE USED TO PROMOTE HATRED HOME SECRETARY SAID TO BE PREPARING TO ANNOUNCE AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE WAY SHARIA COURTS OPERATING BRITAIN AND HEALTH CHECKS FOR THE OVER FORTIES KNOWN AS MIDLIFE M.O.T. THESE ARE DISMISSED AS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY IN THE DAILY MIRROR IT SIDES A REPORT WHICH SUGGESTS THE TEST DO LITTLE TO PREVENT HEART ATTACKS OR STROKES OR CUT SMOKING RATES PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND INSISTS THEY MAY HAVE PREVENTED THOUSANDS OF HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES BUT SAYS LITTLE LOOK AT THEIR FINDINGS
AND AT QUARTER TO SEVEN OUR MAIN NEWS IS THE NEWS THAT LEICESTER CITY ONCE DISMISSED AS FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE OUTSIDERS HAD WON THE PREMIER LEAGUE IN ONE OF THE GREATEST UPSETS IN SPORTING HISTORY
NOW DONALD TRUMP COULD MOVE A BIG STEP CLOSER TO SECURING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION TODAY IF HE WINS THE PRIMARY IN INDIANA THE TOP TRUMP FORCES HAVE TARGETED THE MIST WEST MID WESTERN STATE TO TRY TO DENY THE BILLIONAIRE OF THE DELEGATES THAT HE NEEDS FOR VICTORY AND THEY'RE PINNING THEIR HOPES ON A VICTORY FOR TED CRUISE NICK BRYANT REPORTS NOW FROM INDIANAPOLIS
THEY'RE FIRED UP INDIANA HAS THE FEEL OF HER CRUISES LAST
HIS SUPPORTERS NO HE NEEDS DESPERATELY TO WIN HERE TO STAND ANY CHANCE OF BLOCKING DONALD TRANCE PART FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO LATE FOR HIM
NOW YOU THINK YOU CAN STOP DONALD TRUMP I HAVE
HE'S OUR LAST HOPE I CONTINUED LEVITY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES YOU PUT IT THAT STRONGLY ABSOLUTELY IT'S FULL A NOMINATION IN HILARY
THE GREAT STATE OF IT
AFTER SIX THUMPING DEFEATS THE TEXANS ONLY HOPE IS TO START THE BILLIONAIRE OF THE DELEGATES NEEDED FOR VICTORY AT THE FORCE WHAT'S CALLED THE CONTESTED CONVENTION HE'S CUT A DEAL WITH HIS RIVAL JOHN CASEY TO GIVE A CLEAR RUN IN INDIANA AGAINST
HE'S FRAMING THE CONTEST AS A SIMPLE CHOICE WE GET BEHIND A CAMPAIGN THAT IS BASED ON YELLING AND SCREAMING AND CURSING AND IAN'S
WHY DON'T WE CONTINUE TO UNIFY BEHIND A. POSITIVE OPTIMISTIC FORWARD LOOKING CONSERVATIVE CAMPAIGN THE PROBLEM FOR HER CRUISES THAT NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE LIKE HIM AND TOO MANY PEOPLE HATE HIM LAST WEEK THE FORMER REPUBLICAN HAIR SPEAKER JOB BEENA DESCRIBED
AND LOOSE
THIS REALLY IS DO OR DIE FOR THE STOP MOVEMENT I FED AGREES YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN STOP THEM FROM HIM AND WE'LL AND WE'RE GOING TO
TURNED OUT TO BE THE WORST STATE TO BE THE LAST STATE TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST PETE SEAT WHO SAYS THE PACK WITH CASE THICK HASN'T WORK PARTLY BECAUSE THE MOST CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN IN THE RACE
IT'S TRYING TO ATTRACT THE SUPPORTERS OF THE MOST MODERATE HE'S RUNNING RADIO ADS ON THE LARGEST TYPE RADIO STATION IN THE STATE ABOUT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND MIRROR
BIG MISTAKE BIG MISTAKE TO FOCUS AND SOCIAL ISSUES WHEN YOU NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVEN BY FISCAL POLICIES ANY MORE PRAGMATIC REPUBLICANISM TO COME OUT GO FOR IT
CERTAINLY THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF CUSTOMERS BUYING TROUBLE MERCHANDISE OUTSIDE HIS RALLY IN INDIANAPOLIS EITHER WAY TO SHOW YOU OUR YOU KNOW MAKE AMERICA BUT ABOUT THIS EFFORT TO TRY AND STOP DONALD TRUMP IN INDIANA IN A FILM AS WOULD IT'S TOY BACKFIRED PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO TOTALLY BACKFIRED I MEAN THEY THINK WE'RE STUPID THEY THINK BRILLO INFORM VOTE
SUGGESTS THAT DONALD FELT WILL WIN HERE HAD SUCH IS HIS DOMINANCE AFTER HIS VICTORIES IN NEW YORK ANOTHER NORTH EASTERN STATES
HE COULD EVEN AFFORD TO LOSE HERE AND STILL SECURE THE NOMINATION WE ARE WAY OVER AND WAY AHEAD OF PROJECTION AND WELL THAT WILL DO IT ON THE FIRST BALLOT BUT IF WE WIN INDIANA AT
HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NEAR THE POINT OF
THAT WAS NICK BRYANT TO REPORTING IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WERE LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WE'LL BE HEARING FROM BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH ABOUT PLAYING KING RICHARD THE THIRD IN THE B.B.C.'S HOLIDAY CROWN WE ASKED HIM WITH HIS SHERLOCK HAT ON WHETHER HIS DISTANT RELATIVE RICHARD THE THIRD REALLY DID KILL THE PRINCES IN THE TOWER STILL A POINT OF CONTROVERSY MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS ON
BUT THAT SHIRT I CAN OF COURSE FOR CERTAIN THAT HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND IT WAS THE EARL OF ROCHESTER I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT
IT'S JUST I WOULD SAY THIS FORENSICS HAVE SHOWN US EXTRAORDINARY THINGS ABOUT THE MAP NEAR ALCOHOLIC IN THE LATTER YEARS OF HIS LIFE HIS DEFORMITY WAS A DEFORMITY IT WASN'T INVENTED BY SHAKESPEARE IS OBVIOUSLY BECAME MUCH MORE MANIFEST IN HIS LATER YEARS IT WAS A PROGRESSIVE FORM OF SCOTT PROCESS THIS SORT OF TWISTING OF THE SPINE SOUTHWARDS THE DESPERATION OF CHILD LOST WITH HIS VERY BELOVED WIFE AND I THINK THAT IS VERY WELL DOCUMENTED
I DON'T HAVE A NEW FATHER SITE I GUESS I'M A SUCKER FOR THAT KIND OF P.R. IF IT IS P.R. BUT HE OVERCAME A HELL OF A LOT SO I'M NOT TRYING TO PAINT HIM AS A SAINT A REALITY I DON'T KNOW I DIDN'T MEET THE GUY AND HAVE SADLY DID BUT IT'S A BRILLIANT PIECE OF ENTERTAINMENT BUT OVERALL AND ABOVE ALL POLITICS IT IS REALLY A MASTERFUL STUDY
IMAGINE A HORSE WITH ODDS OF FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE WINNING THE GRAND NATIONAL IMAGINE AN ENGLISHMAN
WINNING WIMBLEDON IMAGINE ITALY WINNING THE RUGBY WORLD CUP EACH A FAIRYTALE BUT LAST NIGHT FOOTBALL'S FAIRYTALE CAME TRUE BELIEVER SEE FOOTBALL COMMENTATOR CONDOM MACH MCNAMARA TAKES A LOOK BACK NOW AT THE SPORTING UNDERDOGS WHO'VE TAKEN A BREATH AWAY
SPORT IS USUALLY A LEVELLER MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE FASTEST RUNNER WINS THE RACE THE STRONGEST BOXER WINS THE BELT
IN RECENT TIMES IN PROFESSIONAL SPORT IT IS OFTEN THE WEALTHIEST TEAM THAT LIFTS THE TROPHY BUT WHAT REALLY CAPTURES OUR IMAGINATION IS WHEN A SURPRISE CANDIDATE BOX THE TREND BUT FORGOT
IT'S A GOLD CUP
THE ODDS ARE OVERCOME WHEN THE FORM BOOK IS THROWN OUT THE WINDOW
WITH A SPORTING FAIRYTALE STRIKES LEICESTER CITY OF HITCHED THEIR WAGON TO A STAR AT THIS SEASON BUT IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES A SIMILAR MIRACLE HAPPENED AT NOTTINGHAM FOREST
IT WILL BE MANAGED BY BRIAN CLOUGH FOREST WERE PROMOTED TO THE TOP FLIGHT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THEY IMMEDIATELY BECAME CHAMPIONS OF ENGLAND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND THEN INCREDIBLY ADDED BACK TO BACK EUROPEAN COPS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY THE GOAL THE CROWD WAS TAKE IT WHICH IS A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD NYMPHET
COME ON EDGE NADIA COMMON H. WAS ONLY FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN SHE BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN TO SCORE A PERFECT TEN IN AN OLYMPIC GYMNASTIC EVENT THE ROMANIAN WAS ELEVATED TO WORLDWIDE FAME AFTER HER PERFORMANCE ON THE ON EVEN BARS
TO SCORE A PERFECT TEN WAS SUCH AN UNPRECEDENTED ACHIEVEMENT THAT IT CAUSED HUGE CONFUSION AT THE EVENT THE ELECTRONIC SCOREBOARD WAS NOT CONFIGURED TO HANDLE A DOUBLE FIGURE SCORE THE BEST THE SCOREBOARD OPERATOR COULD DO WAS SHOW ONE POINT ZERO ZERO
BETTER STOP TALKING NOW ATTENTION
TOAD YOU KNOW THAT I WAS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIMES WHEN I'D BE THUNDER KNOWS
I'M STILL THE GRADE AT THE FAIR OF COURSE THE FAIRYTALE DOES NOT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THE FIRST TIME A SPORTSPERSON ACHIEVES GLORY
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR MUHAMMAD ALI APPEARED TO HAVE HIS GREATEST DAYS BEHIND HIM SEVEN YEARS EARLIER ALI HAD BEEN STRIPPED OF HIS TITLES AND SUSPENDED FROM BOXING FOR REFUSING TO BE DRAFTED INTO THE U.S. ARMY NOW AT THE AGE OF THIRTY TWO HE FACED THE REIGNING WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION GEORGE FOREMAN
USING A TACTIC THAT ALLEY CALLED ROPE A DOPE HE LEANED BACK AND ABSORBED FOREMAN'S POWERFUL PUNCHES FOR SEVERAL ROUNDS UNTIL THE YOUNGER MAN STRENGTH HAD BEEN SAPPED IN THE EIGHTH ROUND FOREMAN WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND MUHAMMAD ALI AGAINST ALL THE ODDS IT WAS ONCE AGAIN
I TOLD YA I'M THE REAL CHAMPION I TOLD YA I'M THE TYPE AND OTHERWISE
THIS IS FAIRY TALE WILL HAS INSPIRED THE WORLD WATER AUTHOR MICHAEL MOORE POGO TO WRITE UP THAT'S AN ORIGINAL NEW STORY THE FOX AND THE GHOST KIT
YOU CAN WATCH A VIDEO OF THAT MICHAEL MOORE POGO READING IF YOU GO TO OUR WEBSITE AND WE'LL BE HEARING IT ON THE PROGRAMME IN A BENARES
IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN EVERYONE IN THE U.K. IS LIVING LONGER THAN EVER BUT IF YOU ARE RICHER AND BETTER EDUCATED YOUR LIVE MUCH LONGER THAN IF YOU ARE
OR LESS WELL EDUCATED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES THAT GAP IS WIDENING THE MAN BEHIND THE RESEARCH IS LES MAYHEW THERE IS PROFESSOR OF STATISTICS AT KATH'S BUSINESS SCHOOL AND JOINED ME HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SIR THIS IS PARTICULARLY NOTABLE FOR MEN ISN'T IT WHAT DID YOU FIND WE FOUND THAT WELL IF I JUST PUT IT INTO CONTEXT IN THE
EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES UP TO ABOUT NINETEEN FORTY THERE WAS A CLOSING OF THE LIFESPAN GAP HAS HER LIFE EXPECTANCY INCREASED AND WE PUT THAT DOWN MAINLY TO IMPROVEMENTS IN STANDARDS OF LIVING CLEAN WATER AND ALL THE USUAL THINGS FROM THAT TIME BUT THE MOMENTUM OF ALL THOSE CHANGES SEEM TO RUN OUT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND THEN THE LIFESPAN INEQUALITIES BECAME STUCK BUT STUCK AT THE LEVEL THAT THEY WERE WHICH WAS ROUGHLY
THIRTY FORTY YEARS BETWEEN THE LONGEST LIVED IN THE SHORTEST LIVED FROM NINETEEN NINETY HOWEVER THIS GAP STARTED WIDENING AGAIN ESPECIALLY FROM FOR MALES AND I THINK A COUPLE OF REASONS I MIGHT GO FOR THAT ONE IS THAT SOME MEN ARE NOW LIVING TO INCREDIBLY OLD AGES
PARALLELING WOMEN BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE DISTRIBUTION THERE'S NOT BEEN AS MUCH PROGRESS SO THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE CAP OH O.K. AT THIS POINT IN TIME SO AT ITS BEST IT WAS OR WHAT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES AND THE GAP THEN WAS THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS IT WAS YES THAT'S RIGHT NO IT WAS FORTY YEARS IN THE
PRE NINETEEN FORTIES BUT THEN BY NINETEEN EIGHTY IT WAS STILL THIRTY THREE YEARS THIRTY THREE YEARS FOR MEN THE GAP BETWEEN THE LONGEST THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO LIVE LONGEST AND THAT GAP WAS TYPICALLY DOWN TO WHETHER YOU WERE RICHER AND BETTER EDUCATED WELL OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT ONLY RICH IN THE HIGHEST AND POOREST IN THE LOWEST GROUP BUT ON BALANCE
DATA PARALLEL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO DIE SO THE GAP IS THIRTY THREE YEARS IN THE EARLY NINETIES AND HAS WIDENED TO WHAT NOW WELL IT'S WIDENED BY ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN YEARS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN SO ABOUT THIRTY FOUR YEARS NOW WHICH IS WHAT SEEMS QUITE SIGNIFICANT
WELL IT IS IT IS A PITY THAT IT'S NOT NARROWING FURTHER IT'S STILL NARROWING FOR EXAMPLE INTO COMPARATOR COMFORTED COUNTRIES WHERE WE WERE LOOKED AT ESPECIALLY ITALY FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN BUT IT SEEMS TO BE SLIGHTLY WHY I THINK FOR MEN HERE AND WOMEN ARE NOT IMPROVING EITHER I GOT IT AND SLICE BANGOR AND THE REASON YOU THINK THAT IS IS THAT THOSE WHO ARE WEALTHIEST HAVE ACCESS TO
FAR BETTER MEDICINES FOR BETTER EDUCATION AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES THAN THEY HAVE EVER HAD BEFORE AND SO THEIR RACING AHEAD WELL I WOULDN'T PUT IT THERE STOCK CLEARS THAT I THINK IT'S MORE TO DO WITH PERSONAL CHOICES WHETHER YOU CHOOSE TO SMOKE DRINK HEAVILY EXERCISE DIET PROPERLY AND ALL THOSE THINGS COME INTO IT AND THE EVIDENCE SEEMS TO BE THAT MORE EDUCATED BETTER OFF PEOPLE
PROCESS THAT THOSE MESSAGES ARE MUCH BETTER AND THE LIKELY MORE LIKELY TO ADOPT THEM AND LESS EDUCATED AND IT SO HAPPENS THAT THE LESS EDUCATED MORE LIKELY TO BE POOR PROFESSOR LES MAYHEW THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE VERY WELCOME

IN THEIR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HISTORY LEICESTER CITY HAVE NEVER WON THE LEAGUE

ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST DAVID
IN HISTORY DURING THE COURSE OF THE SEASON LEICESTER CITY IN THEY'RE TALISMANIC ITALIAN MANAGER CLAUDIO RANIERI OUTFOXED THE GLAMOUR CLUBS
EVERY NEUTRAL FANS' FAVOURITE UNDERDOG BUT THEY WERE HANDED THE WIN BY CHELSEA WHO SACKED RANIERI TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN THE OWNER WAS QUOTED AS SAYING HE WOULD NEVER WIN THE LEAGUE
FOOTBALL FANS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN LEFT WONDERING HOW LEICESTER WON THE TITLE WITH A TEAM ASSEMBLED FOR LESS THAN THIRTY MILLION POUNDS A SPORTS EDITOR ROWAN CONSIDERS THE SECRETS OF THEIR SUCCESS
LEICESTER CITY SCOUT'S FOUND STARS WHERE OTHERS BARELY LOOKED PROLIFIC STRIKER JAMIE VARTY FROM NON LEAGUE FLEETWOOD TOWN RIYADH MARE IS FROM THE FRENCH SECOND DIVISION RECENTLY CROWNED PLAYER OF THE YEAR
THE CLUB MAY HAVE BILLIONAIRE TIE OWNERS BUT THE ENTIRE FIRST ELEVEN COST JUST TWENTY THREE MILLION POUNDS A FRACTION OF SOME OF THEIR MUCH WEALTHIER RIVALS
BUT MANAGER CLAUDIO RANIERI SHOWED JUST WHAT WAS POSSIBLE THE LIKEABLE ITALIAN MAINTAINING COMPOSURE AND FORGING A SKILFUL RESOLUTE TEAM THAT CONFOUNDED THOSE WHO EXPECTED EACH CHALLENGE TO FADE
FOR ALL THE TALENT TIMING WAS ALSO KEY THIS IS SEASON WHEN THE BIGGEST CLUBS FALTERED LEICESTER CITY TOOK FULL ADVANTAGE AND SPORT WILL NOW WAIT TO SEE WHETHER THE CLUB'S VERY FIRST TITLE WAS A ONE OFF OR A SIGN THAT THE MODERN GAME ISN'T QUITE AS PREDICTABLE AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT
THOUSANDS OF PARENTS IN ENGLAND ARE EXPECTED TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME TODAY IN PROTEST AGAINST NEW SATS TESTS FOR SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS CAMPAIGNERS SAY THEY'RE CREATING STRESS AND ANXIETY AMONG PUPILS MONICA MEALS SIX YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WILL BE TAKING THE TEST SOON AT HER PRIMARY SCHOOL IN MANCHESTER
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE STANDING UP AND SAYING THIS IS NOW TOO MUCH WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR CHILDREN'S WELFARE AND ONE DAY TO STAND UP AND SAY THIS IS NOT O.K. ANY MORE HE'S ACTUALLY PART OF THE BIGGER PICTURE AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO DO AN AWFUL LOT LESS DAMAGE TO OUR CHILDREN HOWEVER THE SCHOOLS MINISTER NICK GIBB THESE URGING PARENTS NOT TO TAKE ACTION
I'VE BEEN TO MANY SCHOOLS WHERE THE CHILDREN DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE TAKING THE TESTS THEY DON'T HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY'D HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES FOR THE CHILDREN THEY ARE THERE TO HOLD SCHOOLS TO ACCOUNT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY
HE'S EQUIPPING CHILDREN BUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS
A REPORT HAS WARNED THAT CUTS TO THE GOVERNMENT'S FLAGSHIP BENEFITS REFORM UNIVERSAL CREDIT ARE JEOPARDISING ITS MAIN OBJECTIVE HAVE ENSURING THAT PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS BETTER OFF IN WORK UNIVERSAL CREDIT IS DUE TO BE ROLLED OUT AROUND THE COUNTRY BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT THE INDEPENDENT THINK TANK THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATIONS THAT UNLESS THE FLOORS ARE ERADICATED IT RISKS BEING REDUCED TO LITTLE MORE THAN A VERY COMPLICATED VEHICLE FOR CUTTING THE BENEFITS BILL HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON
THE UNIVERSAL CREDIT IS THE BIGGEST OVERHAUL OF THE WELFARE SYSTEM SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES THE ROLLING TOGETHER OF SIX SEPARATE BENEFITS INCLUDING JOBSEEKER'S ALLOWANCE AND WORKING TAX CREDITS INTO A SINGLE PAYMENT BUT IMPLEMENTING THE IDEA ACTUALLY MAKING IT HAPPEN HAS BEEN BESET BY DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS
THE NEW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB HAS SAID HE'S COMMITTED TO WHAT WAS HIS PREDECESSOR IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S PETS PROJECT BUT THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATIONS CRITICISMS ECHO THOSE OF MISTER DUNCAN SMITH WHEN HE RESIGNED FROM THE CABINET BUDGET CUTS RISK UNDERMINING THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF WELFARE REFORM
NOT SO INSISTED STEPHEN CRABB THE NEW SYSTEM HE SAID HELPED CLAIMANTS MOVE INTO WORK FASTER AND EARN MORE
DONALD TRUMP COULD ALL THAT WRAP UP THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION TODAY WITH VICTORY IN THE INDIANA PRIMARIES THE POLLS SUGGEST HE'S OPENED A BIG LEAD WITH HIS CRITICISM OF FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS RESONATING AMONG BLUE COLLAR WORKERS NICK BRYANT REPORTS FROM INDIANAPOLIS
INDIANA HAS BECOME THE DO OR DIE CONTEST FOR THE STOP TRUMP FORCES BECAUSE IF THE BILLIONAIRE WINS HERE HE'LL BECOME VIRTUALLY UNSTOPPABLE IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNITE THE ANTI TRUMP VOTE HIS RIVAL'S TED CRUISER JOHN CASE IT CAME TO AN ARRANGEMENT GIVEN THE TEXAN SENATOR A CLEAR RUN
BUT IT'S BEEN HARD TO PERSUADE BACKERS OF THE MODERATE CASE IT TO LEND THEIR SUPPORT TO CRUISE WHO CLAIMS TO BE THE MOST STAUNCHLY CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE IN THE RACE BESIDES THERE'S NO GREAT TRADITION IN AMERICAN POLITICS OF TACTICAL VOTING
AFTER SIX THUMPING VICTORIES IN NEW YORK ANOTHER NORTH EASTERN STATES TRUMP HAS COME TO THIS MID WESTERN BATTLE GROUND WITH A STRONG WIND AT HIS BACK AT THE POLLS SUGGEST HE'S POISED FOR VICTORY HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM CLAIMS THAT THAT WOULD MAKE HIM THE INEVITABLE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE
AN EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD GIRL HAS BEEN RESCUED FROM THE RUBBLE OF A BUILDING WHICH COLLAPSED FOUR DAYS AGO IN THE KENYAN CAPITAL NAIROBI MORE THAN TWENTY PEOPLE DIED WHEN THE PROPERTY CAME DOWN IN HEAVY RAIN AND OFFICIALS FEAR THAT MORE BODIES WILL BE FOUND
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THE RICHEST AND POOREST MEN IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS INCREASING RESEARCHERS AT THE CASS BUSINESS SCHOOL IN LONDON SAY THE GAP GREW BY ONE POINT SEVEN YEARS BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHEN IT WAS AT ITS NARROWEST AND TWO THOUSAND NINE CATRIONA RENTON REPORTS
RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT THE DETAIL OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO DIED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AGED OVER THIRTY THEY FOUND THAT IN ENGLAND AND WALES THE TOP FIVE PER CENT OF MEN REACHED AN AVERAGE AGE OF NINETY SIX THAT IS THIRTY THREE YEARS LONGER THAN THE BOTTOM TEN PER CENT WHO ON AVERAGE LIVE TO THE AGE OF SIXTY THREE MEANWHILE THE LONGEST SURVIVING WOMEN LIVED UNTIL THEY WERE NINETY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE THE LOWEST AVERAGE SIXTY SEVEN
THE AUTHORS OF THE REPORTS SAID MANY OF THE BIG GAINS FROM PUBLIC HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND BETTER HOUSING WHERE IN THE PAST AND THAT PERSONAL LIFESTYLE CHOICES SUCH AS SMOKING AND DRINKING WERE NO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THE STUDY SUGGESTS LACK OF WEALTH IS NOT DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIFFERENCE BUT THE POOREST GROUPS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF DECADES OF POOR LIFESTYLE CHOICES AND INCOME INEQUALITY
A STUDY SAYS THAT PARENTS NOW OFFER THEIR CHILDREN SO MUCH HELP BUYING A HOME THAT THE BANK OF MUM AND DAD HAS BECOME ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST MORTGAGE LENDERS THEY'RE EXPECTED TO HAND OVER FIVE BILLION POUNDS THIS YEAR HE HAS A PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT SIMON GUMPERT
IN THE AREAS WHERE HOUSE PRICES HAVE SOARED FIRST TIME BUYERS ARE RELYING INCREASINGLY ON THE SO CALLED BANK OF MUM AND DAD TO HELP THEM AFFORD A HOME THE RESEARCH FROM LEGAL AND GENERAL AND THE ECONOMIC CONSULTANCY C. E. B. R. SUGGEST PARENTS WILL BE INVOLVED IN A QUARTER OF ALL PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS THIS YEAR
PROVIDING LOANS OR GIFTS OF SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS ON AVERAGE THEY'LL HELP THEIR CHILDREN TO QUALIFY FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORTGAGES THE FIVE BILLION POUND TOTAL MEANS THE BANK OF MUM AND DAD RANKS ALONGSIDE CLYDESDALE BANK AS THE TENTH MOST SIGNIFICANT MORTGAGE LENDER
SIMON GONE PUTS REPORTING THERE IT IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW YOU DON'T NEED TO LOVE FOOTBALL INDEED YOU MIGHT EVEN LOATHE IT AND YOU COULD STILL RELISHED THE STORY OF A SPORTING DAVID FURLING NOT

HERE ARE THE STADIUM IN LEICESTER THE FANS THE BOTTLES THE CABINS ALL OF WHICH SHOWED THE PARTY
THAT WENT ON LONG INTO THE NIGHT HAVE NOW BEEN REPLACED BY A ROW OF T. V. TRUCKS AND SATELLITE DISHES
AROUND THE WORLD THERE IS AN APPETITE FOR THE STORY OF HOW LITTLE LESTER TIP NOT FOR GLORY BUT FOR ANOTHER SEASON OF CRUSHING DISAPPOINTMENT HAVE SEALED OFF ALL THAT LONDON AND MANCHESTER
LAST NIGHT THIS CITY HELD ITS BREATH AND THEN OPEN THEIR LUNGS TO BELLOW WITH PRIDE AS IN PUBS ALL OVER THE CITY THEY WATCH THEIR NEAREST RIVALS SPURS FAILED TO BEAT CHELSEA AND KEEP THE TITLE RACE ALIVE
STORY NOT JUST OF THE TEAM A BIT OF A CITY DID
WHAT ODDS THEY WERE FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE A CITY THE SEVENTH OF THE SIZE OF THE HOME OF UNITED AND CITY
ONE TWENTY SIX THE SIZE OF THE HOME OF CHELSEA AND ARSENAL THE COST OF ITS ENTIRE TEAM LES THE ONE OF THOSE TEAMS STAR PLAYERS
LEICESTER'S FIRST DIRECTLY ELECTED MAYOR PETER SALISBURY IS HERE WITH ME AT THE KING POWER STADIUM WHERE THE MORNING COMMUTE IS GOING PAST AND THE HORDES OF BEING SOUNDED EASY TRUE PETER SALISBURY THIS IS A CELEBRATION
THIS CITY IS JOINING IN OR JUST A FEW NOISY
THE CITY THAT WAS PARTY ICKWORTH DIED HE WOULD SAY CITY IS IT
ENJOYING THE BOAT THIS MORNING IT REALLY DID HAPPEN YESTERDAY WITH THAT BECAUSE
FOREVER TELLING PEOPLE HOW GREAT THIS THAT HE IS VERY PROBABLY THE MOST DIVERSE CITY ANYWHERE IN EUROPE AND MANY PEOPLE UNLESS I THINK SECRET TEAM AS A METAPHOR FOR THE CITY
SHOWING WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED WHEN YOU BRING TOGETHER A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO OTHERS HAD WRITTEN OFF A DIVERSE GROUP OF ON THE PITCH BUT AS YOU SAY VERY DIVERSE A CITY KNOWN FOR ITS VERY LARGE ASIAN POPULATION NOW TRADITIONALLY FOOTBALLERS STRUGGLE
TO APPEAL TO ANYBODY BEYOND THE NON WHITE IN THE NORMAL WHITE AUDIENCE IS THIS CITY AS A WHOLE
YOU SHOULD BUY WHAT'S HATED MAY HAVE STRUGGLED OUT OF THE TIMES NOW THE PLACE PLACES IT HE'S NOT STRUGGLING HERE IN LEICESTER YOU GO DOWN THE BELGRAVE ROAD IN LEICESTER WHICH IS
LOCALLY AS THE GOLDEN MILE AND AN AREA OF A LOT OF ASIAN TRADERS AND VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE SHOT
IT'S GOT BLUE AND WHITE DECKING AND HE'S SHOWING OFF FOR THE CITY IT'S REALLY HAS IS SOMETHING THAT'S UNITED ALL OF THEIR MANY COMMUNITIES THAT MAKE UP LEICESTER NOW YOU'RE A MARE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET BUSINESSES HERE YOU TRIED TO GET JOBS HERE CAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS
NAKED HE DIFFERENCE OR IS IT A GREAT PARTY THE LAST A WEEK BUT YOU TELL YOUR KIDS ABOUT YOUR GRANDCHILDREN THEN IT'S OVER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE I WENT LAST YEAR JUST SPENT TWELVE MONTHS AGO WE WERE BURYING KING RICHARD THE THIRD HELD RE BURYING KING RICHARD THE THIRD IN A CATHEDRAL AND WE THOUGHT IT COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER WE HAVE THE EYES OF THE WORLD ON THIS AT THAT TIME A BATTER'S MADE A MAJOR BOOST THE CITY'S ECONOMY DON'T RECKON MANY TENS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF COMING ON THE BACK OF THAT WELL WE DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD GET ANY BETTER
WELL IT HAS AND HE'S THE CALYX EVEN BIGGER MATT HERE WE ARE AT THE KING POWER STATE IS NAMED AFTER THE BOOKMAKERS NOT KING RICHARD THE THIRD BUT THERE ARE SOME MAKE THE CONNECTION
THEY SAY IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT LAST MARCH SO NEITHER TEAM STARTED WINNING GAMES AGAIN AND THE TALK OF RELEGATION WAS GOD
THE CHAMPIONSHIP WAS IN PROSPECT WHAT DO YOU PUT IT THERE IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT WE ARE SOMEHOW BEING REPAID FOR HAVING RE BURY KING RICHARD WITH DIGNITY AND HONOUR IN A CATHEDRAL I SUSPECT ACTUALLY THE REALITY IS IT'S A BRILLIANT TEAM AND AMAZING LEADERSHIP FROM TWO MANAGERS MAGIC PERSON ALLOWED BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY GOOD STORY FOR THE CITY AND ONE THAT WE ARE VERY HAPPY TOO
DEAD PEOPLE FOLLOW AND BELIEVE AS A SERIOUS POINT WHAT DO YOU PUT THEIR SUCCESS DOWN TO BECAUSE IT IS EXTRAORDINARY A TEAM SO
SO POOR RELATIVELY SPEAKING MADE UP OF PLAYERS WHO WERE EITHER IT MINOR LEAGUES
DOWN IN DIVISION SEVEN OR EIGHT IN FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE HAVE MANAGED TO DEFEAT THE GIANT TEETH
I THINK THEY THAT THEY'LL SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LEICESTER HAS A SPOON THE TEAM SPIRIT IN THE FACT THEY HAVE BEEN UNITED WITH
WITH LEECHES CLAUDIO AND THE WAY THAT PLAYED TOGETHER SO GENEROUSLY AND SO SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER AND THAT PROBABLY IS
LOOKING BACK ON THE SEASON THE THING THAT HAS MADE THEM SUCH AN OUTSTANDING SUCCESS BUT THIS PARTY FOR LEICESTER IS FAR FROM MOVE IT IS FAR FROM OVER TWO WEEKS THE SEASON WERE PARTY OLLO THROUGH THERE AND THEN A BIG CELEBRATION ON THE ON THE CITY STREETS AFTER THE END OF THE SEASON AND LOOKING BUT THEN OF COURSE TO PLAYING IN EUROPE
PETER'S OLD B. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND WE'RE GOING TO BE TRYING TO TAKE A LOOK REALLY WHAT THIS FOOTBALL SUCCESS MEANS NOT JUST FOR OTHER SPORTS WILL BE TALKING TODAY BRAILLE'S BUT OF COURSE THE DIRECTOR
FORMERLY DIRECTOR OF BRITISH CYCLING PERFORMANCE RICHARD BRITISH CYCLING WE'LL ALSO BE TALKING TO A SPORTS EDITOR DAN ROWAN AND WILL BE TALKING TO NEIL BACK THE GREAT LEICESTER TIGERS
IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN NOW THE WHOLE POINT OF UNIVERSAL CREDIT THE GOVERNMENT'S MASSIVE REFORM OF THE BENEFIT SYSTEM IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO WORK THAT PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER OFF WORKING THAN ON BENEFITS BUT THE THINK TANK THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION SAYS IT'S BEEN TAKEN TOO FAR FROM THAT ORIGINAL PURPOSE AND HAS VEERED OFF TRACK BECAUSE OF COST CUTTING AND IT WARNS THAT
WHAT IT CALLS THE SERIOUS DESIGN FLAWS SHOULD BE RESOLVED BEFORE IT'S EXPANDING WELL THAT MORNING COMES THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED A FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE SCHEME WE'RE JOINED BY DAVID FINCH'S SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST AT THE RESOLUTE AS A RESOLUTION FOUNDATION JOINS US FROM TUNBRIDGE WELLS GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHY IN WHAT WAY HAS IT VEERED OFF
WELL IT'S IT'S STILL THE CASE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF IN WORK AND UNIVERSAL CREDIT AND I THINK THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A GOOD THING BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE SHAPE OF THOSE AND CENTRE THAT PEOPLE HAVE AND PARTICULARLY INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO EARN MORE IS PARTICULARLY WEAK SO PEOPLE CAN ONLY KEEP AROUND THIRTY FIVE PENCE OF AN EXTRA POUND THAT THEY EARNED
AND THOSE BENEFITS START TO BE WITHDRAWN AT QUITE A LOW POINT WHEN PEOPLE ARE ONLY WORKING AROUND FIVE OR TEN HOURS A WEEK AND SO THERE'S A RISK THAT PEOPLE PARTICULARLY SINGLE PARENTS GET TRAPPED TO QUITE LOW LEVELS OF PAY AND FELT PROGRESS SO WELL THEY MAY BE AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO GET INTO WORK THAT INCENTIVE FOR THEM THEN TO BOOST THEIR EARNINGS AND PROGRESSING WORK IS WEAK OH CASE IT'S A BIT LIKE A TAX RATE OF SIXTY FIVE PER CENT
THAT'S IT THAT CAN RISE UP TO SEVENTY SIX PERCENT WHICH PAYING TAX AND EVEN HIGHER IF YOU PAY FOR CHILDCARE COSTS AND THIS IS BECAUSE WHAT GRADUALLY THE THE ORIGINAL PLAN HAS BEEN CHANGED AS MONEY'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THERE
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT EVEN WHEN FIRST BROUGHT IN AS A GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT INCENTIVE TO WEREN'T WAS WAS AT THIS LEVEL OF ONLY KEEPING AND THIRTY FIVE PENCE OF WHAT YOU WEREN'T BUT THE SUCCESS OF CUTS THAT HAVE COME OVER REDUCE THAT POINT AT WHICH THOSE BENEFITS START TO BE WITHDRAWN DOWN FROM FOR SOME PARENTS PUT AROUND TWENTY HOURS A WEEK RIGHT DOWN TRY AND TEN HOURS A WEEK
AND I THINK TO REALLY MAKE A SUCCESS OF THE SCHEME THOSE BEEN CENTRES IN THERE NEED TO BE REFOCUSED BACK ON SINGLE PARENTS AND ALSO SECOND BERNICE WHO ACTUALLY FACE THESE WITHDRAW RATES THE MINUTE THEY ENTER WORK SO THEY WOULD
SAFE THEY WERE EARNING FIVE THOUSAND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP HER SEVENTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS OF THAT AND IF IT IS ALWAYS IF IT IS STILL THE CASE THAT IT IS BETTER OFF TO WORK SURELY THE INCENTIVE STILL EXISTS AND I THINK IT'S TO DO WITH STRENGTH INCENTIVE SO FOR INSTANCE AT THE MOMENT A SINGLE PARENTS ENTERING WORK SIXTEEN HOURS WOULD LOSE MOST OF THE BENEFITS IF THEY
WORKED LESS THAN SIXTEEN HOURS NOW IF THEY MOVED FROM SIXTEEN HOURS DON'T AROUND TEN THEY COULD WORK SIX HOURS LESS BUT ONLY LOSE AROUND EIGHTEEN POUNDS A WEEK OF INCOME AND SO THAT STARTS TO BECOME A VERY REAL TRADE OFF BETWEEN GOING TO WORK AND THE HASSLE THAT MAY BRING ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL AND GO BACK AND PICK THE CHILD UP TO THE ACTUAL FINANCIAL GAIN THAT YOU GET FROM DOING SO O.K. SO THE ARGUMENT WAS DO A BIT OF WORK BUT NOT TOO MUCH
WELL I THINK THERE'S THERE'S AN IMPORTANT INCENTIVE THEIR WESTERN PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THOSE SIXTEEN HOURS IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM SO PARTICULAR FOR DISABLED PEOPLE AND POTENTIALLY PARENTS WITH VERY YOUNG CHILDREN THAT'S A GOOD THING BUT IT'S NOT HOPE WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO SEND STRONGER SUPPORTS BOTH PRACTICAL AND ON THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES LIKE TO HELP PEOPLE BASED THEIR OWNING SOME PROGRESS ONCE THEY'RE IN WORK SO WOULD YOU BE ARGUING THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REVERSE THE CUTS THAT THEY MADE WOULD THAT ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE TALKING
I MEAN I THINK I'LL BE A STARTING POINT IN THAT HE WOULD HURT IT WOULD ALLOW THAT REINVESTMENT IN THE SYSTEM AND THOSE THAT SUPPORTS BE REFOCUSED BUT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING IN THE PRACTICAL SUPPORT ON OFFER THERE
TO BE PEER CURRENTLY LOOKING AT A SYSTEM WHERE THEY'RE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO WORK UP TO FULL TIME AT THE MINIMUM WAGE WE THINK THERE COULD BE MORE AMBITIOUS THAN THAT AND REALLY PUT IN SUPPORT TO HELP PEOPLE MOVE OUT OF LOW PAY AND AWAY FROM THE MINIMUM WAGE FLOOR AND REALLY TRY AND
AND TRAP LIKE CONVERTING TO POTENTIAL PEOPLE HAVE O.K. DAVID FINCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL BE SPEAKING FOR WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB AT ABOUT TWENTY PAST EIGHT THIS MORNING THANKS VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND ONE OF THE LARGEST LISTED FUND MANAGERS HAS THEIR RESULTS OUT IT'S ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT WITH NEWS FROM THAT THEY ARE LEGATE IS BACK WITH US HELLO THEO THANKS SARAH YES THEY DO MAKE THE RATHER GRIM READING ON THE FACE OF IT ACTUALLY PRE TAX PROFITS FOR THE SIX MONTHS TO THE END OF MARCH DOWN FROM TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION POUNDS A YEAR AGO TO JUST ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION THAT'S FORTY PERCENT FOR
CAPITAL OUTFLOW PEOPLE REMOVING FUNDS OF SIXTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS COMPARED TO ELEVEN POINT THREE BILLION LAST YEAR NOW ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT IS A SPECIALIST IN EMERGING MARKETS AND TO PUT IT BLUNTLY THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND MANY OF THEM ISN'T AS SUNNY AS IT ONCE WAS I'M JOINED NOW BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND CO FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY MARTIN GILBERT MARTIN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SO BRAZIL RUSSIA CHINA EMERGING MARKETS GENERALLY LOOKING RISKY INVESTORS RESPONDING IS THERE ANY LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL WHERE I MEAN
PLACES LIKE BRAZIL ARE UP THIRTY PERCENT THIS YEAR WHICH IS WHICH IT'S IS ODD I I THINK ALSO WE'RE SEEING PROBABLY A TURN AROUND AND FLOWS AND OUR EMERGING MARKET FUNDS AND FACT THIS IS THE FIRST QUARTER WE'VE SEEN NET IN FLOWS FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS SO THE MARKET'S TELLING US THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT REALLY TOM ON ON THE GROUND CERTAINLY THEY'RE CHEAP AT THE MOMENT SO IT'S A BIT IT SEEMS A REASONABLE REASONABLE BET
O.K. SO YOU THINK THE FUTURE IS LOOKING GOOD NOW MOVING ON A LITTLE BIT ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAYED A LEADING ROLE RECENTLY IN THE SHAREHOLDER REVOLT AGAINST THE B.P. CHIEF EXECUTIVE BOB DUDLEY'S FOURTEEN MILLION POUND PAY PACKET IS THIS AN ISSUE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP ON MAKING A STAND UP YEAH I THINK WE'RE SEEING DEFINITELY MORE INTEREST FROM THE OWNERS OF THE COMPANY I PEOPLE LIKE US SHAREHOLDERS IN IN REMUNERATION
WE'RE NOT AGAINST REMUNERATION PER SE BUT WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE ASKING THE CHAIRS FOR ME AN ORATION COMMITTEES TO DO IS TRY AND BE MORE SENSIBLE AND SMELL THE COFFEE WHATEVER OR MIGHT BE JUST GET OUT AND REALLY GET BACK TO REALITY SO NO SHE'S WHAT
THE THING LOOKS LIKE AS MUCH AS I THINK AND B.P.'S CASE IT LOOKED ODD TO US THAT WHILE THEY WERE MAKING THESE REDUNDANCIES COST CUTS THEY WERE REWARDING THE THE SEA WITH SUCH A BIG GIRL
WITH SUCH A BIG PAY PACKAGE DO YOU THINK PAY PACKETS OF THAT SIZE CAN EVER BE PROPERLY JUSTIFIED I THINK THEY PROBABLY CAN IF IF THE COMPANY HAS DONE SPECTACULARLY WELL ARE OR IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY NEED TO BE EXPLAINED AND I THINK ALSO COMPANIES HAVE TO COMMUNICATE MORE WITH SHAREHOLDERS MARTIN GILBERT CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND CO FOUNDER OF RUBBING ALICE ASSET MANAGEMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU
THEO THANKS VERY MUCH TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THREE EARTH LIKE PLANETS HAVE BEEN FOUND BY AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM OF SCIENTISTS AND BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE THAT THEY COULD SUPPORT LIFE THEY'VE WRITTEN UP THEIR FINDINGS IN THE JOURNAL NATURE WE'RE JOINED BY DOCTOR KAREN MASTERS HE'S AN ASTRONOMER AT THE INSTITUTE OF COSMOLOGY AND GRAVITATION OF PORTSMOUTH UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING DOCTOR MASTERS GOOD MORNING WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE PLANETS
HOWARD WHY THEY ARE LIKE EARTH WHERE IT WAS SAID THE WAY THAT THEY'RE LIKE EARTH IS THAT WE BELIEVE THEY'RE THE RIGHT DISTANCE FROM THEIR STAFF OR LIQUID WATER TO EXIST THEY ALSO HAVE RATHER SIMILAR MASSES TO THE EARTH AMBER THEY ORBIT A STAR THAT'S MUCH MUCH DIMMER THAN THE SUN SO THEY'RE ORBITING MUCH MUCH CLOSER TO THEIR STAR THAN THE EARTH DOES TO THE SUN OH KAY AND IT'S THE FACT THAT WATER EXISTS MEANS WHAT THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THERE IS SOME FORM OF LIFE THERE YEAH I MEAN IT'S SORT OF THAT LOOK WHAT
LOOK FOR WHAT YOU KNOW WE KNOW ONE EARTH ANYWHERE THERE'S LIQUID WATER THERE'S LIFE AND SO SORT OF THE FIRST STEP TO FINDING PLACES WHERE WE THINK LIFE MIGHT BE POSSIBLE OUTSIDE OF THE EARTH WILL BE LOOKING FOR LIQUID WATER OH KAY THE THERE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS OF COURSE THAT ARE REQUIRED HAT WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THERE IS LIFE
SO WE NEED TO KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT THESE PLANETS AND THERE'S SOME REALLY BIG TELESCOPES COMING UP THAT I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A POSSIBILITY OF DETECTING THE ATMOSPHERE ON THESE PLANETS ONE FUNNY THING ABOUT THEM IS THAT THEY'RE TIDILY LOCKED WITH THEIR STAR AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT ONE SIDE OF THEM IS ALWAYS IN DAYLIGHT ON ONE SIDE IS ALWAYS A IN NIGHT TIME AND SO THE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DAYTIME SIDE IN THE NIGHT SOMETIMES CAN BE VERY LARGE AND EXACTLY HOW HABITABLE THEY ARE DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON WHAT KIND OF ATMOSPHERE THEY HAVE ON THEM
KAY WHEN WE WHEN WE GOING TO KNOW I SUPPOSE IS THE QUESTION COS PRESUMABLY THESE WERE JUST STUMBLED A POND BUT NOW THAT YOU CAN FOCUS MORE TELESCOPES ON THEM WE CAN GET SOME MORE INFORMATION SO I ACTUALLY JUST LOOKED AT THE BETTING ODDS I WAS JUST INTERESTED IN IT AT ONE HUNDRED TO ONE THAT WE FIND LIFE OUTSIDE THE EARTH BEFORE TWENTY NINETEEN AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY REASONABLE THESE BIG TARGETS ARE COMING ONLINE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS GOING TO DETECT THE ATMOSPHERES OF THESE PLANETS WE FINDING MORE AND MORE EXTRA SOLAR PLANETS WE NOW THINK
PRETTY MUCH EVERY STAR HAS PLANETS OF SOME KIND ONE IN FOUR MIGHT HAVE EARTH LIKE PLANETS SO SO THE ODDS ARE DEFINITELY IMPROVING THAT WERE FABULOUS WHAT HAPPEN WITH LESTER SEEMS OF THESE VERY BADLY THAT'S IN FACT I LOOKED AT THE ODDS DISCUSSING THEIR RELATIVE AND LIKELY NEST OF LEICESTER CITY WINNING THE PREMIER LEAGUE AND FINDING LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS THERE WE HAVE IT GARY MASTERS THANKS VERY MUCH THANKS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED HE'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND YOU'D HAVE TO BE ON ANOTHER PLANET NOT TO KNOW THE LEICESTER WON THE PREMIERSHIP ROB IS HERE WITH ME AT THE KING STAYED IN WITH THAT AND THE OTHER SPORTS IT WAS YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL HAVE BEEN SWEEPING UP THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES AS YOU'VE SEEN IN THE REST OF THE STREET PARTY DEBRIS HERE OUTSIDE LEFT THE CITY'S KING STADIUM THIS MORNING THOUSANDS HERE LATE LAST NIGHT
WELL INTO THE EARLY HOURS AS THEIR TEAM ACHIEVE WHAT CERTAINLY COUNTS AS THE BIGGEST STORY IN PREMIER LEAGUE HISTORY ALL THIS THE CONSEQUENCE OF A DRAMATIC AND IT HAS TO BE SAID A FEISTY GAME LAST NIGHT AT STAMFORD BRIDGE TOTTENHAM LEICESTER'S ONLY CHALLENGERS TWO UP AT HALF TIME WITH GIRLS FROM CANAAN SORRY MEN CHELSEA REPLYING TO KAY HILL THEN
SUPERBLY THROUGH HAZARD SO TWO ALL AND LESTER'S TITLE GIVEN THERE SEVEN POINT LEAD OVER SPURS WERE JUST TWO GAMES TO PLAY AND IMMEDIATELY THE EXPLOSION OF COURSE OF LEICESTER JOY AND FROM THE ENGLAND STRIKER WHO PLAYED FOR BOTH SPURS AND LEICESTER BUT HE'S A LEICESTER MAN AT HEART THIS APPRECIATION OF THE CLUB'S MANAGER CLAUDIO RANIERI
HE'S DONE IT THIS SEASON WITHOUT ANY OF THESE MIND GAMES NO PLAYING TRICKS WITH THE MEDIA TRYING TO GET REFEREES WOUND OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT HE'S HANDLED EVERYTHING SO BEAUTIFUL IS SUCH A LIKEABLE LOVELY MAN I'M JUST SO PLEASED FOR HIM AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE AND IF IT MEANS I HAVE TO WEAR PANTS DAY MUCH OF THE DAY IT OPENED IT'S I SUPPOSE
BUT GARY LINEKER NOT THE ONLY ONE PIECE PIZZA A BASIN IS CHAIRMAN OF THE FOX'S TRUST BOARD GOODBODY WHATEVER WE DID MAKE A RASH PROMISE LIKE GARY LINEKER DID YOU KNOW I HAVE THAT ON THE PITCH THE GIRL YOU LOOK AT WHEN WE HELPED SAVE THE CLUB IN TWO THOUSAND

BIT OF A NOISY CITY THIS MORNING ISN'T IT YOU'VE GOT THE EVERYBODY JOBBY BY TOOTING THEIR HORNS AND IT VERY MUCH WELL AS EVEN NOISIER LAST NIGHT AFTER AFTER THE FINAL WHISTLE OF HITS BEDLAM DOWN HERE WE'VE HEARD GARY LINEKER'S ASSESSMENT OF CLAUDIO RANIERI WATCH
I THINK HE'S BUILT ON WHAT NIGEL PEARSON DID THE FOUNDATIONS REALLY I MEAN I THINK YOU'VE GOT THE TEAM SPIRIT HERE I THINK ONE KEY THING WAS THAT NIGEL'S BACKROOM STAFF STAYED WHEN CLAUDIO TOOK OVER AND HE DIDN'T CHANGE MUCH AT ALL TRAINEE ROUTINES SPORT SCIENCE WHICH
WELL WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST SO SO HE BUILT ON IT BUT I THINK CLAUDIO'S EDITION WAS REALLY THE TACTICAL NOUS AT THE START OF THE SEASON HE WAS
WE WERE A LOT OF GOALS BUT HE WAS MAKING KEY TWEETS AND SUBSTITUTIONS AND CHANGING GAME SO WE GO TWO ZERO DOWN AND DRAWER STILL WIN BUT THEN HE DECIDED TO CHANGE IT CHANGE THE FULL BACKS MADE THEM FAR MORE DEFENSIVE
SUDDENLY WE WERE WINNING A LOUDER ONE MILLS INSTEAD SO HE'S JUST MADE CHANGES AS THE GUY EVEN JOAN ONE GAME I CAN REMEMBER HIM JUST CHENEY BIT REFORMATION FOR A FEW MINUTES WHO'S FUCHS FORWARD AND WE SCORED AT THE YOU'RE VERY KEEN TO POINT OUT THAT THE FOXES TRUST IS NOT A SUPPORTERS' CLUB JUST GIVE US A FEEL FOR THE DISTINCTION SUPPORTERS' TRUST SHE GENERALLY TEND TO LOOK AT THE
FINANCIAL SITUATION OF CLUBS THAT THEY'D MAKE SURE THEY RUN CLUBS ARE RUN IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE SO THAT IT'S A BIT MORE THAN
I WILL DEVELOP THAN A SUPPORTERS' CLUB IN TERMS OF JUST SUPPORTING THE AIM IS TO TO MAYBE INVEST IN THE CLUB OR HAVE US THIS IS A MODEL THAT IS BECAME BECOMING RATHER MORE COMMONPLACE THAN BEFORE IT IS THAT IT CANNOT LIBERTY YOU NEED YOUR MONEY AT THE MOMENT BUT IT CAN WORK I MEAN IT WORKS AT PREMIERSHIP LEVEL YOU'VE GOT SWANSEA HAVE GOT TWENTY SIR TWENTY ONE PERCENT OWNERSHIP OF THE CLUB
IT CAN WORK TO THE DEGREE I DON'T THINK IT WAS JUST EVER OWN A PREMIERSHIP CLUB BUT THEY WILL
MAYBE A PART OF IT AND THEY CAN STILL HAVE A KEY ROLE IN INFLUENCE THE CLUB AND DISCUSS FANS ISSUES WITH THE CLUB KEY FINAL QUESTION ABOUT MITZI'S NO YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HANG ON TO THE PLAYERS THE LARDER

FANS OF LEICESTER CITY FOOTBALL CLUB POURED ONTO THE STREETS OVERNIGHT TO CELEBRATE THEIR TEAM WINNING THE PREMIER LEAGUE FOR THE FIRST TIME IT WAS A VICTORY AGAINST THE ODDS THE SIDE STARTED THE SEASON AS FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE UNDERDOGS BUT WHEN THEIR CLOSEST RIVALS TOTTENHAM MANAGED ONLY TO DRAW AGAINST CHELSEA THEY SECURED THE TITLE WIN DESCRIBED AS A FAIRYTALE BY THE PRESIDENT A FAITHER
PARENTS ARE PLANNING TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN AWAY FROM PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND TODAY TO PROTEST AGAINST CHANGES TO NATIONAL TESTS CAMPAIGNERS SUGGEST THE SATS TESTS PLEASE CHILDREN UNDER UNNECESSARY STRESS AND NARROW THE SCOPE OF THEIR EDUCATION HOWEVER MINISTERS ARGUE IT'S UNFAIR TO TAKE CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A DAY AND THAT THE TESTS ARE VITAL TO ENSURE THEY'VE GRASPED MATHS AND ENGLISH
IT'S BEEN CLAIMED THAT BUDGET CUTS RISK DRIVING THE UNIVERSAL CREDIT AWAY FROM ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF ENSURING THAT PEOPLE IN WORK ARE BETTER OFF THE THINK TANKS THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION SAID THERE WAS A DANGER THAT IT COULD VEER OFF TRACK AND END UP BECOMING A VEHICLE TO CUT THE BENEFITS BILL
DONALD TRUMP SAYS THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION WILL BE HIS IF HE WINS TODAY'S PRIMARIES IN INDIANA SUPPORTERS OF HIS RIVAL'S SENATOR TED CREWS HAVE CONCEDED THAT IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO BLOCK MISTER TRUMP IF HE WINS IN INDIANA
RESCUE WORKERS IN KENYA HAVE BROUGHT OUT AN EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD CHILD FROM THE RUBBLE OF A BUILDING THAT COLLAPSED FOUR DAYS AGO IN NAIROBI THE SIX STOREY RESIDENCE CAME DOWN IN HEAVY RAIN ON FRIDAY KILLING AT LEAST TWENTY TWO PEOPLE MANY OTHERS ARE STILL THOUGHT TO BE BURIED
UNDERSTUDY HAS INDICATED THAT THE DISPARITY BETWEEN PEOPLE'S LIFE EXPECTANCY IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS GROWING PROFESSORS AT CITY UNIVERSITY IN LONDON DISCOVERED THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS THE GAP BETWEEN THEIR LIFESPANS OF RICH AND POOR MEN IS INCREASING THEY PUT IT DOWN TO DIFFERENCES IN LIFESTYLE IT'S NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT
IN THEORY NUCLEAR FUSION THAT SHOULD BE THE PERFECT ENERGY SOURCE SMASHED TOO READILY AVAILABLE FORMS OF HYDROGEN TOGETHER TO RELEASE HUGE AMOUNTS OF ENERGY RELATIVELY LITTLE RADIOACTIVE WASTE AND NO GREENHOUSE GASES GASES
BUT CONTROLLING THE PROCESS HAS ALWAYS PROVED SO DIFFICULT THAT ALL NUCLEAR POWER SO FAR HAS BEEN BASED ON NUCLEAR FISSION THE SPLITTING OF ATOMS THE FIRST TRULY INTERNATIONAL ATTEMPT AT BUILDING A FUSION REACTOR IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE HAS ALREADY COST FIFTEEN BILLION EUROS AND WILL COST AT LEAST ANOTHER FOUR BILLION AND WON'T SEE ITS FIRST TESTS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO
IS IT WORTH IT WELL PROFESSOR STEVE COWLEY IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE U.K. ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY HE'S BEEN PART OF THAT TEAM ARE REVIEWING THAT AND WHETHER IT IS WORTH CONTINUING WITH IT AND HE'S WITH ME IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR COUNTY GOOD MORNING AND YOUR ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WHAT DO THEY KEEP GOING BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ANYBODY HAD EXPECTED
THIS IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY THE MOST HISTORIC EXPERIMENT OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BECAUSE WE'VE KNOWN FOR A HUNDRED YEARS THAT THIS IS REALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY WAY TO MAKE ENERGY
BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO DO THIS EXPERIMENT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE GOT TO THE STAGE THAT NOT ONLY CAN WE MAKE FUSION HAPPEN BUT THE FUSION WILL SUPPORT ITSELF AND BE OF A SELF SUSTAINING WHAT WE CALL A FUSION BURN
WHICH IS SORT OF LIKE HAVING A LITTLE STAR ON EARTH WILL JUST SIT THERE AND PRODUCE ENERGY FROM THE FUSION REACTION I THINK THAT'S WORTH AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY YOU I THINK YOU'RE
THERE THE FIRST TIME THE ONLY TIME THAT A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF ENERGY FROM NUCLEAR FUSION HAS BEEN CREATED WAS IN THE MACHINE IN YOUR LAP IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT JET WHICH IS THE PRECURSOR TO EATER HAS PRODUCED SIXTEEN MILLION WATTS OF FUSION POWER THAT SAYS THAT WE CAN DO IT
NOW WE'VE GOT A SHOW THAT WE CAN DO IT ECONOMICALLY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE ELECTRICITY FROM IT I COULD BUT THAT WAS BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN I THINK YOU SAID AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WHEN I SPEAK A LITTLE EARLIER SO WHAT ON TWO OCCASIONS IT'S HAPPENED HERE WE ARE TWENTY SIXTEEN BILLIONS HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THIS AND THE REQUEST IS FOR BILLIONS MORE JUST AN EXTRA FOUR BILLION OR ARE WE TALKING DO WE KNOW THAT THAT ACTUALLY IT'S GOING TO COST MUCH MORE THAN THAT
WELL IF YOU PUT IT IN CONTEXT THE WORLD ENERGY MARKET IS SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN TRILLION A YEAR
A FIFTEEN BILLION TO PRODUCE A TECHNOLOGY THAT MIGHT DOMINATE HALF OF THAT MARKET
OVER OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS INTO THE FUTURE I THINK IS REALLY WORTH IT
THESE SUMS OF MONEY LOOK HUGE BUT WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WORLD ENERGY MARKET AT THEIR TRIVIA
IT'S A NO BRAINER AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED I'M AFRAID TENACIOUS AND YET WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE IT'S
THIS I'M IN THE EATER PROJECT IT'S IT'S HOSTED BY THE E.U. BUT IT'S FUNDED INTERNATIONALLY ISN'T IT YES IT'S ACTUALLY HOSTED BY THE E.U. BUT THERE ARE SEVEN INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS THERE'S CHINA INDIA JAPAN KOREA RUSSIA UNITED STATES AND THE E.U.
IT'S BEEN TWO EXPERIMENTS REALLY IT'S AN EXPERIMENT IN PHYSICS
TO DO FUSION BUT HE'S ALSO AN EXPERIMENT IN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION AND I THINK WHEN THE PROJECT STARTED IT WORSENED
CONSTRUCTED EXACTLY RIGHT IN TERMS OF THAT SECOND EXPERIMENT AND WE'VE SEEN IT STRUGGLE TO GET THE RIGHT COST IN THE RIGHT AND THE RIGHT SCHEDULE OF WHAT WE DID WITH OUR COMMITTEE WAS TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE NOW PRODUCED AS THEIR NEW SCHEDULE AND ASKED THE QUESTION IS IT NOW CREDIBLE O. K. AND THE ANSWERED WHERE YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE THE U.S. CONGRESS DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
I THINK WE CAN CONVINCE THEM IT'S CREDIBLE AND THEN WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION ARE THEY ARE THEY WILLING TO AFFORD IT AND YOU THINK THE ANSWER WILL BE ET I VERY MUCH HOPE SO PROFESSOR STEVE COWLEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH

A YEAR OR SO AGO FOX WAS SITTING ONE WINTER'S NIGHT IN ONE OF HER FAVOURITE PLACES THE CAR PARK WHICH THEY WERE DIGGING UP FOR SOME REASON
SHE WAS CONTEMPLATING THE SHAME OF IT ALL AGAIN OF LOSING THE MATCH CHELSEA HOW SHE HATED THAT CROWING COCKEREL OF A MARINE
THE VOICE SHE HEARD CAME FROM DEEP DOWN BELOW THE GROUND
I SMELL YOU FOX IT SAID DO ME A FAVOUR WILL YOU I WANT YOU TO SHOW THOSE ARCHAEOLOGISTS WHERE I AM THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ME BUT THEY CAN'T FIND ME
FOXES DICK RIGHT WOULD YOU PLEASE DIG A TUNNEL TOWARDS WHERE I AM I'LL KEEP TALKING YOU'RE FIND ME YOU CAN'T MISS ME I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE NOT UNTIL YOU FIND ME ANYWAY WHO ARE YOU FOX ASKED THE KING
CAME THE REPLY THE KING OF ENGLAND YEAH

I WANT A TEAM TO WIN THE MATCH THE FOXES THE BLUES LEICESTER CITY ME AND MY FAMILY AND MY KIND OF SUPPORTED THEM FOREVER
THEY'VE NEVER WON A THING FOX THOUGHT SHE HEARD SNIGGERING BENEATH THE GROUND LISTEN FOX YOU GET ME OUT OF HERE

AND HURL PRAY YOUR KINGSHIP WILL YOU DO THAT I TOLD YOU I AM THE RIGHTFUL KING OF ALL ENGLAND BESIDES I AM A GHOST I CAN DO STUFF SUCH STUFF AS DREAMS ARE MADE ON
SHAKESPEARE THAT ROGUE AND PEASANT SLAVE HE'S INSIDE MY HEAD THAT INFERNAL SCRIBBLE HAUNTS MY LIFE AND MY DEATH TO THIS DAY
HIS VOICE WAS SOUNDING RATHER AGITATED NOW ALAS ALACK IT WENT ON BUT FOR A HORSE A KINGDOM WAS LOST MY KINGDOM
THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH PAINFUL ENOUGH TO BUT SHAKESPEARE TOOK MY REPUTATION REPUTATION AND WHO DO THEY CELEBRATE NOW ALL OVER THE WORLD MEET NO
RUDDY SHAKESPEARE AND I END UP IN A CAR PARK IN LEICESTER NOT IN A CATHEDRAL LIKE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS JUST GET ME OUT OF THIS CAR PARK AND I WILL ENSURE THE FOXES OF LEICESTER CITY WIN THE LEAGUE PROMISE
WELL FOX LIKE DIGGING ANYWAY SO SHE JUMPED DOWN INTO THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORKINGS AND DUG AND DUG BY MORNING SHE WAS THAT CLOSE TO HIS VOICE SHE COULD ALMOST SMELL HIM HE THANKED HER QUITE POLITELY BUT SHE WAS NOT FOOLED BY POLITENESS
WHEN THEY FIND YOU YOU JUST KEEP YOUR PART OF THE BARGAIN FOX TOLD HIM AND WHEN SHE SLEPT THAT NIGHT
SHE DREAMED OF THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM THE FOXES OR WINNING THE LEAGUE VODDY HOLDING THE CUP ALOFT AND EVERY BOX IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE MOON
THEY DISCOVERED THE GRAVE OR RICHARD THE THIRD THE VERY NEXT DAY AND AFTER A BIT OF HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL CAR FUFFLE BURIED HIM WITH ALL THE POMP AND DIGNITY HE HAD SO LONGED FOR IN LEICESTER CATHEDRAL
AND DO YOU KNOW WILL SHAKESPEARE WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT KING
IN PART AT LEAST RICHARD THE THIRD OF ENGLAND WAS A MAN OF HIS WORD HE KEPT HIS PROMISE TO FOX
THEY WERE THERE ON ANOTHER MOONLIT NIGHT A YEAR OR SO LATER OUT ON THE LEICESTER CITY FOOTBALL PITCH THE DAY THEY WON THE LEAGUE THE WHOLE CITY WAS GOING BANANAS BUT THE FOOTBALL STADIUM WAS QUIET NOT A SOUL
SO ARE YOU A HAPPY FOX TONIGHT THE KING ASKED TONIGHT EVERY FOX ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IS HAPPY THANKS TO YOU YOUR KINGSHIP SAID FOX HOW ON EARTH DID YOU MANAGE TO DO IT
I TOLD YOU A KING CAN DO STUFF AND A GHOST CAN DO EVEN MORE
SUCH STUFF AS DREAMS ARE MADE ON SAID FOX HAD SHAKESPEARE HE'S GOT INSIDE YOUR HEAD TOO HASN'T IT
YOU COULD WATCH AND YOU CAN LISTEN TO A LONGER VERSION OF THAT BEING READ BY MICHAEL BALL MICHAEL MORE PER GIRL I'M SORRY
I KNOW LESTER OF COURSE MAYBE A STRANGER TO FOOTBALLING SUCCESS BEFORE LAST NIGHT BUT HE'S NOT A STRANGER TO SPORTING SUCCESS THE TIGERS THE CITY'S RUGBY TEAM
HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONS NO FEWER THAN TEN TIMES LAST WEEK THEY CLINCH THEIR PLACE IN THE PREMIERSHIP PLAY OFFS FOR THE TWELVE SUCCESSIVE YEAR I'M JOINED HERE AT THE NOISY KING BOW STADIUM
BY THE FORMER LEICESTER CITY'S FLANKER WORLD CUP WINNER A COACH HIMSELF NEIL BACK GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING CAN YOU RELISH FOOTBALL SUCCESS IN THE CITY OR IS THERE A BIT OF YOU THAT RESENTS ALL THE ATTENTION ALL THE NOISE OH ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC FOR THE CITY IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME TO COME IN AND THINK WHERE THEY WERE
THE START OF LAST YEAR TO WHERE THEY ARE NOW IT'S INCREDIBLE AND ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT AND AS A COACH HE'S A FORMER GREAT PLAYER YOURSELF
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS TEAM OF CHEAP PLAYERS PLAYERS FROM MINOR LEAGUES HERE AROUND ME
PULLED INTO A TEAM THAT COULD BE THE MIGHTY MIGHTY UNITED THE RICH CITY OR CHELSEA AND ARSENAL
IT'S A FANTASTIC STORY AND I THINK WE COULD LEARN A LOT FOR IT SO HOPEFULLY IT'S DOCUMENTED WHAT'S EXACTLY GONE ON THE ON THE SCENE AT THE HEAD OF IT ALL IS RANIERI
HE'S COME ACROSS FANTASTICALLY WELL ON CAMERA I'M SURE IT'S GALVANISED THE PLAYERS TO BRING THIS GROUP TOGETHER AS YOU SAID RELATIVELY I WANT YOU TO THE WORD CHEAP BUT
NOT NOT EXPENSIVE IN THE WORLD OF FOOTBALL HE'S KEPT THEM TOGETHER TO GET THEM HOME BALL IS GET MY WORKIN HARD THEIR WORK IS REALLY INCREDIBLE
PEOPLE SAID THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING YOU CAN'T GET LUCKY SIX TIMES ON THE BOUNCE A LOT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE FORM THAT THIS TEAM HATS THAT HE'S MADE IT ENJOYABLE TO PLAY AND THEREFORE THEY'VE NOT BEEN TERRIFIED BY THE SUCCESS THEY'VE HAD IS THAT A LESSON FOR PEOPLE IN OTHER SPORTS IN OTHER WALKS OF LIFE TO ME
I THINK YOUR BUSINESS DONE SPORT TO MAKE IT FUNNY ENJOYABLE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GIVE MORE TO IT THAT THE LESS THE PLAYERS HAVE GIVEN AND LET'S NOT FORGET THEM YOU'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT
TEAM BEHIND THE SCENES IN TERMS OF GETTING THE PEOPLE AT THE PLAYERS RECOVERED FOR THE NEXT GAME THAT'LL BE CHALLENGED NEXT YEAR WHETHER IN A CHAMPIONS LEAGUE AND A BRIEF FINAL WORD THIS IS NOT A PROSPEROUS CITY IT'S NOT ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST CITIES IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE CITY
I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN SPORT SUCCESS IN LEICESTER BUT NOT NOT PARTICULARLY IN FOOTBALL FOR A LOT OF THE TIME BUT THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC LEICESTER TIGERS AS YOU SAID EARLIER GO REALLY WELL THE CRICKET
THE SPEEDWAY THE LEICESTER OF COURSE WE CAN'T FORGET MARK SELBY YOU KILL IT BETWEEN THE TWO GAMES LAST NIGHT
WORLD CHAMPION THREE TIMES ON THE BOUNCE FANTASTIC WHEN THEY BACK LET'S HOPE THEIR SUCCESS GOES ON THANK YOU FOR JOINING US PLEASURE
IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A CARDIFF STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THIS THE FOR PARTY WAS A MEMBER OF THE TREE RATNER BUDDHIST ORDER GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WELL CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE IN LEICESTER MAYBE THE BLESSINGS OF THOSE BUDDHIST MONKS DID HELP
MEANWHILE FRIDAY IS MY SON'S SEVENTH BIRTHDAY AND AFTER THE CARDS AND PRESENTS WHO GO OFF TO SCHOOL WHERE LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHER CHILDREN HE'LL BE SITTING HIS FIRST NATIONAL TEST
OF COURSE HE'S UNAWARE OF THE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER TESSA HELPFUL WAYS TO MONITOR PROGRESS AND RAISE STANDARDS WERE US AN IMPOSITION THAT CONSTRAINS TEACHERS AND PUTS KIDS UNDER PRESSURE
AS A BUDDHIST I ENCOURAGE MY SON TO DEVELOP THE ATTITUDES THAT BUDDHISM PRIZES SOME BUDDHIST TRADITIONS EMPHASISE ACADEMIC STYLE LEARNING WHAT OTHERS ARE MORE WARY OF INTELLECTUAL UNDERSTANDING
BUT THEY AGREE THAT EDUCATION SHOULD INCLUDE ETHICAL TRAINING BECAUSE A CHILD'S OUTLOOK WILL AFFECT EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS
IN FACT THE WHOLE BUT THIS PATH IS DESCRIBED AS A FORM OF TRAINING WITH MORAL DEVELOPMENT AT ITS ROOT
IN ONE BUDDHIST SCRIPTURE THE BUDDHA COMES ACROSS A GROUP OF BOYS WHO ARE FISHING AND ASKS THEM DO YOU DISLIKE PAIN YOURSELVES
THAT SETS THE TONE FOR HOW BUDDHISTS APPROACH F.X. THE BUDDHIST ETHICAL PRECEPTS TELLING PEOPLE TO AVOID KILLING LYING AND SO ON I DESCRIBED THIS TRAINING PRINCIPLES THAT INVITE US TO ADOPT THE UNDERLYING ATTITUDE THE RULE EXPRESSES
BUT IT DOESN'T TELL THE BOYS OFF EVEN THOUGH HE BELIEVED IT'S UNETHICAL TO CAUSE SUFFERING FOR YOUR OWN ENJOYMENT
INSTEAD HE ENCOURAGES THEM TO EMPATHISE WITH THE DISTRESS OF THE FISH AND CONNECT IMAGINATIVELY WITH THE PRINCIPLE THAT ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES
IT'S AN EXPERIMENTAL FORM OF LEARNING DOESN'T CONTRADICT OR MORE ACADEMIC APPROACH THAT PRIORITISES THE CAPACITY FOR ETHICAL REFLECTION
EMOTIONAL SENSITIVITY AND SELF AWARENESS THEY UNDERLIE THE WHOLE PROCESS OF LEARNING AND EXTEND BEYOND FORMAL EDUCATION TO LIFE AS A WHOLE
I REJOICE WHEN I SEE THOSE PRIORITIES REFLECTED IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM BUT EXCEPT THAT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THEY'RE MY RESPONSIBILITY
WHEN MY SON GOBBLES HIS FOOD OR GETS IMPATIENT WITH TECHNOLOGY I RECOGNISE MY OWN TENDENCIES TO DO THE SAME THINGS HIS ACTIONS MIRROR BACK TO ME MY OWN STATES OF MIND MY BEHAVIOUR AND MY ETHICAL PRACTICE I ALSO SENSE MY CAPACITY TO INFLUENCE HIM POSITIVELY BY MODELLING THE QUALITIES I WANT HIM TO LEARN
WHETHER OR NOT TESTS SHOULD HAPPEN IT'S A MATTER OF POLITICAL DEBATE
BUT FOR NOW THEY'RE A FACT OF LIFE FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND PARENTS MY RESPONSIBILITY AS I SEE IT IS TO APPROACH THE TESTS WITH PATIENCE AND KINDNESS
THAT WOULD SIR HELP MY SON TO DO THE SAME AND PERHAPS IN A SMALL WAY THAT'S PART OF THE TRAINING THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH VISH FOR PAWNEE IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
WELL IT IS NOT OFF AND IF EVER YOU HEAR ABOUT CHILDREN AND PARENTS STRIKING FROM SCHOOL BUT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TOLD WILL HAPPEN TODAY WHEN THOUSANDS OF YEAR TWO SIX SIX TO SEVEN YEAR OLDS WILL BE KEPT OFF SCHOOL IN PROTESTS AT THE TESTS THAT THEY'RE BEING SET TESS THAT MANY PARENTS AND TEACHERS HAVE SAID EXPECT TOO MUCH OF CHILDREN TOO YOUNG WHEN OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT IS IN CHEAM IN SOUTH LONDON GOOD MORNING ROBERT
GOOD MORNING SARAH YES NORMALLY BY THIS TIME THE SLATER FAMILY WOULD BE GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL BUT THEY'VE JOINED THE BOYCOTT INSTEAD THEY'RE GOING OFF TO NONSUCH PARK DAWN SAY TO HAS SIX YEAR OLD TWINS IN YEAR TWO AT CHEAM FIELDS PRIMARY SCHOOL JOSIE AND GEORGE THERE DUE TO TAKE THE SAT STARTING NEXT WEEK BUT DAWN WHY ARE YOU KEEPING GEORGIAN JOSIE AT HOME WELL THEY'VE BOTH SINCE WE'VE COME BACK FROM THE EASTER HOLIDAYS THEY'VE BOTH BEEN SHOWING SIGNS OF STRESS AND PRESSURE
IN A SUBCONSCIOUS WAY REALLY GEORGIA'S HAD LOTS OF TEMPER TANTRUMS ARE SEVERAL TIMES A DAY AND JOSIE HAS BEEN HAVING LOTS AND LOTS OF NIGHTMARES WHERE SHE'S ACTUALLY BEEN SAYING THINGS LIKE I CAN'T DO IT IT'S TOO HARD AND IN HER SLEEP SHE CAN'T TELL ME THE NEXT DAY WHAT SHE'S DREAMT ABOUT BUT IT'S CLEARLY AFFECTING THEM BECAUSE JOSIE IS HERE WITH US TO JOSIE IF THE TESTS ARE QUITE HARD I THINK WHAT THEY LIKE
WELL DO YOU REALLY DO YOU SEEK HESS THERE HARPER BECAUSE WHEN WE HAD THIS STILL REALLY CALM REALLY LIKE A LIST I CAN YOU WHERE'D DRINK I LIKE BRIE
IT'S A DESTROYED ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE I SEEN YOU DID YOU HAD TO WRITE TEN LINES TINCHY FOR A TEST WHAT HAPPENED THERE
HEY AMY RIGHT NOW O.K. BATCAT WANTING MY WAY TWELVE BECAUSE YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT HER WHY WHAT YOU GOING TO DO TODAY INSTEAD I DON'T NEED LIGHTS NONSUCH PARK AND FIND BAD CHEESE AND SAT SO AN EDUCATIONAL DAY JOIN YOU'RE PLANNING I MEAN THEY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TEST BUT THEY'RE ASSESSING THEIR ASSESSING A MORE CHALLENGING CURRICULUM ON IN ENGLISH AND MATHS TO BRITTAS FAIR ISN'T IT THAT SHOULD BE TESTED
IT IS FAIR BUT I FEEL THAT TEACHER ASSESSMENT IS REALLY AT THIS STAGE THE BEST WAY OF ASSESSING CHILDREN AND THEIR PROGRESS YOU KNOW ANY TEACHER WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY'RE TRACKED THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR CLASS I RAT ON A WEEK TO WEEK BASIS BECAUSE THEY DO DO CONTINUAL ASSESSMENT AND THE CHILDREN AT THIS AGE DON'T NEED THIS PRESSURE AND DISTRESS AND BRIEFLY WHAT DO YOU HOPE FOR STRUCK OLOGIES
I HOPE THAT NICKY MORECAMBE WILL ACTUALLY LISTEN AND TAKE NOTICE OF THEIR PARENTS AND I HOPE THAT THEY WILL CANCEL THE STATS FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN REASSESS THEM READY FOR NEXT YEAR WELL IT'S HARD TO TIE AFFECTED THIS ACTION WILL BE SARAH THEY'RE REPORTED TO BE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED GROUPS OF PARENTS TAKING BUT SOME OF THEM AREN'T EXPECTING A BIG TURNOUT THOUGH THE SCHOOLS MINISTER NICK GIPPER SAID THE CHILDREN YOU DON'T MASTER THE BASICS OF ENGLISH HE MUST RISK LEFT BEING LEFT BEHIND AND STRUGGLE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
AND HE SAYS IT'S UNFAIR OF PARENTS LIKE DAWN TO DEPRIVE THEM EVEN HAVE ONE DAY OF EDUCATION BACK TO YOU ROBERT THANKS VERY MUCH ROBERT PICK THERE IN CHEAM WHERE WE'RE JOINED BY RADIO CAR BY JONATHAN SIMON'S WHO'S HEAD OF THE EDUCATION UNIT AT POLICY EXCHANGE WHICH IS A RIGHT LEANING THINK TANK GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IF CHILDREN ARE GETTING WORRIED ABOUT THESE TESTS AS WE WERE HEARING THAT IT SUGGESTS THAT SOMETHING HAS GONE VERY WRONG
WOULD YOU I MEAN IT WAS AT THAT WAS THAT WAS AWFUL JUST LISTENING TO YOUR LAST PIECE THERE I FELT SO SORRY FOR FOR DAWN AND FUR FOR JOSIE I MEAN I'M A PARENT OF TWO CHILDREN AND MY CHILDREN WERE HAVING NIGHTMARES I'VE BEATEN I'D BE DISTRAUGHT BUT MY QUESTION IS WHAT ON EARTH IS THE SCHOOL DOING TO PUT THAT MUCH PRESSURE
ON A SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL THAT SHE'S HAVING NIGHTMARES THESE TEST OR NOT TO BE THAT LEVEL OF STRESS SO IF I WAS A PARENT IN THAT SCHOOL I WOULD BE FURIOUS BUT I'D BE FURIOUS WITH THE SCHOOL RATHER THAN WITH THE GOVERNMENT TESTS BUT THE SCHOOL WOULD PROBABLY ARGUE LOOK WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THESE TESTS THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE TO THE CHILDREN IT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S FAULT FOR INSISTING AT TESTING AT THIS LEVEL
WELL I'M AFRAID I JUST DON'T ACCEPT THAT AS AS AN EXCUSE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THESE ARE TESTED EVERY SCHOOL NEEDS TO DO BUT IT'S PERFECTLY WITHIN THE SCHOOLS GIFT AND IT IS INDEED THE SCHOOL'S DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE TAKE THEM IN A WAY THAT'S APPROPRIATE OR NOT STRESSFUL AND IN HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY
CHILDREN ARE NOT GETTING STRESSED BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING GIVEN THESE TESTS APPROPRIATELY AND THEY BARELY EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TAKING THEM SO IF IF CHILDREN ARE HAVING NIGHTMARES AND I'LL BEING STRESSED AND I'M GETTING TO THAT LEVEL THAT'S AN ISSUE WITH THE SCHOOL ROTTEN WITH LES THAT THE ARGUMENT IS AND WILL ACCEPT THAT THE CONTENT OF THESE TESTS HAS CHANGED FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THEY ARE MUCH TOUGHER THAN THEY USED TO BE
YES THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND INDEED THE GOVERNMENT HAS DELIBERATELY MADE THEM THAT WAY BUT THEY ARE BENCHMARK TO THE STANDARD THAT CHILDREN HAVE AN EQUIVALENT AGE IN OTHER COUNTRIES CAN BE EXPECTED TO DO THESE THESE THESE TESTS HAVEN'T BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE AIR THEY'VE BEEN CAREFULLY BENCHMARK
FOR EXAMPLE SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS IN OTHER COUNTRIES CAN BE EXPECTED TO KNOW THAT LEVEL OF ARITHMETIC ALL THAT LEVEL OF GRAMMAR I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY CHILDREN ENGLAND OUGHTN'T TO BE EXPECTED TO DO THE SAME THING THAT YOU COULD POP PROBABLY SAY THAT THEY WERE EQUIVALENT TO SOME COUNTRIES BUT NOT TO ALL COUNTRIES THERE ARE SOME COUNTRIES ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL EDUCATION SYSTEMS WHO DON'T TEST WE DON'T HAVE TO DOOR FOR EXAMPLE YOU JUST LOOK AT FINLAND UNTIL THEY'RE EIGHTEEN AND CERTAINLY NOT AT THIS SORT OF LEVEL
NO THAT'S TRUE ALTHOUGH WITHOUT WISHING TO DELVE INTO INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS SAYS THERE'S A REASON WHY FINLAND IS IS NOT A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR HOW ENGLAND OUGHT TO WORK AN EDUCATIONAL COUNTRY IT'S MUCH SMALLER IT'S MUCH MORE SOCIALLY HOMOGENOUS AND INDEED IT'S BEEN PLUMMETING DOWN THE INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE TABLES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO BUT I THINK IT IS REASONABLE TO SAY THAT IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD
AND WE WANT AS AS ENGLAND OUR SIX YEAR OLD AND A SEVEN YEAR OLDS TO BE WELL EDUCATED AND TO KNOW AS MUCH AS AS THE TOP PERFORMING OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THEN I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO EXPECT PRIMARY SCHOOLS TO TEACH TO NEST BUT AGAIN I STRESS THERE IS NO REASON AT ALL WHY SCHOOLS OUGHT TO BE PUTTING CHILDREN POSITION WITH HER HAVING NIGHTMARES AND THERE'S NO REASON AT ALL WHY PARENTS ALL TO THEREFORE BE FORCED TO TAKE THE CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL SO YOUR ARGUMENT IS THE TEACHERS SHOULD EFFECTIVELY SUCK UP THE STRESS AND BUFFER THE CHILDREN FROM IT
DO YOU KNOW IN A SENSE THAT'S PART OF WHAT BEING AN ADULT IS ABOUT IT'S PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM STRESS O.K. THE SCHOOLS MINISTER NICK GIBB SAYS THAT IF CHILDREN CANNOT DO THE SORT OF THINGS THAT ARE BEING SET IN THESE TESTS THEY'RE AT RISK OF STRUGGLING FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IS HE RIGHT WELL I THINK I THINK WHAT HE'S WHAT HE'S SAYING IN A SLIGHTLY DRAMATIC WAY IS THAT IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BASICS IT'S HARDER FOR YOU TO PROGRESS IN THE CURRICULUM SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOLID GRASP OF
OF GRAMMAR OF READING WRITING AND ARITHMETIC IT'S HARD TO ACCESS THINGS LATER ON IN LIFE AND SO TO THAT EXTENT YES HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT KAY BUT IN SOME SENSE WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SOME OF THE THINGS THE EXAMPLES OF PHENOMENAL ABOUT THE DETAIL THAT HAS REQUIRED FROM CHILDREN IT'S MORE THAN THE BASICS IT STUFF THAT A LOT OF ADULTS DON'T KNOW AND DON'T NEED TO KNOW
WELL YOU'RE RIGHT IT STUFF THE LOT OF ADULTS DON'T KNOW AND THAT'S BECAUSE FOR THE LAST TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY ARGUABLY WE'VE DOWNPLAYED THE IMPORTANCE OF GRAMMAR IN EDUCATION AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT A GENERATION OF ADULTS WHO PERHAPS DON'T KNOW THESE THINGS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE TO SAY THESE ARE NOT THINGS WE NEED TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO DO ANYTHING IN LIFE HOWEVER CREATIVE IF YOU WANTED ANYTHING ARTISTIC YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT ENABLES YOU TO GO ON AND THRIVE AND BE SUCCESSFUL AND BE CREATIVE
JONATHAN SIMON'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH

MARVELLOUS IT'S IT'S ALL TOGETHER I HAVE YOU KNOW YEAH I DO
RIGHT PETS WAITED A VERY LONG TIME FOR THIS PURPLE NO IT'S UP WIN ELATED CHAMPION RUNNER AND AS THEIR SUPPORTERS CELEBRATED SO TOO DID THE PLAYERS JOINING STAR STRIKER JAMIE'S GUARDIAN OF THE PARTY AT HIS HOME IN NEARBY MELTON MOWBRAY
ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST DAVID
IN HISTORY DURING THE COURSE OF THE SEASON LEICESTER CITY IN THEY'RE TALISMANIC ITALIAN MANAGER CLAUDIO RANIERI OUTFOXED THE GLAMOUR CLUBS
EVERY NEUTRAL FANS' FAVOURITE UNDERDOG THEY WERE HANDED THE WIN BY CHELSEA HE SACKED RANIERI TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN THEIR OWNER WAS QUOTED AS SAYING HE WOULD NEVER WIN THE LEAGUE FOOTBALL FANS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN LEFT WONDERING HOW LEICESTER WON THE TITLE WITH THE TEAM ASSEMBLED FOR LESS THAN THIRTY MILLION POUNDS A SPORTS EDITOR DAN ROWAN CONSIDERS THE SECRETS OF THEIR SUCCESS
LEICESTER CITY SCOUT'S FOUND STARS WHERE OTHERS BARELY LOOKED PROLIFIC STRIKER JAMIE VARTY FROM NON LEAGUE FLEETWOOD TOWN RIYADH MARE IS FROM THE FRENCH SECOND DIVISION RECENTLY CROWNED PLAYER OF THE YEAR
THE CLUB MAY HAVE BILLIONAIRE TIE OWNERS BUT THE ENTIRE FIRST ELEVEN COST JUST TWENTY THREE MILLION POUNDS A FRACTION OF SOME OF THEIR MUCH WEALTHIER RIVALS
BUT MANAGER CLAUDIO RANIERI SHOWED JUST WHAT WAS POSSIBLE THE LIKEABLE ITALIAN MAINTAINING COMPOSURE AND FORGING A SKILFUL RESOLUTE TEAM THAT CONFOUNDED THOSE WHO EXPECTED EACH CHALLENGE TO FADE
FOR ALL THE TALENT TIMING WAS ALSO KEY THIS IS SEASON WHEN THE BIGGEST CLUBS FALTERED LEICESTER CITY TOOK FULL ADVANTAGE AND SPORT WILL NOW WAIT TO SEE WHETHER THE CLUB'S VERY FIRST TITLE WAS A ONE OFF OR A SIGN BUT THE MODERN GAME ISN'T QUITE AS PREDICTABLE AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT
THOUSANDS OF PARENTS IN ENGLAND ARE EXPECTED TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME TODAY IN PROTEST AGAINST NEW TESTS FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS ORGANISERS OF THE CAMPAIGN LET OUR KIDS BE KIDS SAY THE ENGLISH AND MATHS EXAMS FOR SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS ARE TOO DIFFICULT AND ARE CREATING STRESS AND ANXIETY AMONG CHILDREN OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT REPORTS
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MANY PUPILS WERE MISS SCHOOL TODAY ALMOST THREE HUNDRED GROUPS OF PARENTS HAVE ORGANISED LOCAL BOYCOTTS OF CLASSES AND CLAIMED THAT THOUSANDS OF PUPILS WILL TAKE PART THE STANDARD ASSESSMENT TESTS OR SATS WHICH BEGIN NEXT WEEK TO MOUNT A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF GRAMMAR AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE MORE COMPLEX CALCULATIONS IN MATHS REFLECTING THE MORE CHALLENGING NEW CURRICULUM INTRODUCED LAST SEPTEMBER
PARENTS INSIST THAT THE QUALITY OF CHILDREN'S BROADER EDUCATION IS BEING UNDERMINED AS TEACHING HAS FOCUSED ON THE NARROW REQUIREMENTS OF THE TESTS THE SCHOOLS MINISTER NICK GIBB SAID PUPILS WITHOUT THE BASICS OF MATHS AND ENGLISH COULD BE LEFT STRUGGLING FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND IT WASN'T FAIR ON CHILDREN TO DEPRIVE THEM EVEN HAVE ONE DAY'S EDUCATION
A REPORTER'S WARNED THAT BUDGET CUTS MEAN THE GOVERNMENT'S KEY WELFARE REFORM IS UNLIKELY TO ACHIEVE ITS CENTRAL AIM OF ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO WORK RATHER THAN CLAIM BENEFITS THE INDEPENDENT THINK TANK THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION SAYS UNIVERSAL CREDIT HAS VEERED OFF TRACK AND RISKS BEING A LITTLE MORE THAN A VEHICLE FOR CUTTING COSTS HE HAS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION ACCUSE THE TREASURY OF REPEATEDLY CUTTING FUNDING FOR UNIVERSAL CREDIT THERE BY UNDERMINING THE INCENTIVES IT WAS SUPPOSED TO CREATE FOR CLAIMANTS TO MOVE OFF BENEFITS AND INTO WORK IT'S ESTIMATED SOME TWO POINT TWO MILLION FAMILIES RISK LOSING ON AVERAGE FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR
THEY SAY SINGLE PARENTS AND SECOND EARNERS WHO OFTEN TAKE UP PART TIME WORK ARE PARTICULARLY HARD HIT AND FACE LOSSES OF UP TO SEVENTY PER CENT IN THE BENEFITS THEY RECEIVE ALTHOUGH THE NEW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB HAS EXPRESSED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE SCHEME IT STILL MASSIVELY BEHIND SCHEDULE WITH ONLY AROUND A QUARTER OF A MILLION CLAIMANTS WHEN MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION WERE MEANT TO BE ON IT BY NEXT YEAR
LABOUR HAVE TODAY CALLED FOR A ROOT AND BRANCH REVIEW THE SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY OWEN SMITH SAID UNIVERSAL CREDIT NOW NEEDED TO BE COMPLETELY REINVENTED DONALD TRUMP COULD ALL BUT WRAP UP THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION TODAY WITH VICTORY IN THE INDIANA PRIMARIES THE POLLS SUGGEST HE'S HOPING TO BIG LEAD WITH HIS CRITICISM OF FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS RESONATING AMONG BLUE COLLAR WORKERS NICK BRYANT REPORTS FROM INDIANAPOLIS
INDIANA HAS BECOME THE DO OR DIE CONTEST FOR THE STOP TRUMP FORCES BECAUSE IF THE BILLIONAIRE WINS HERE HE'LL BECOME VIRTUALLY UNSTOPPABLE IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNITE THE ANTI TRUMP VOTE HIS RIVAL'S TED AND JOHN CASE IT CAME TO AN ARRANGEMENT GIVEN THE TEXAN SENATOR A CLEAR RUN
BUT IT'S BEEN HARD TO PERSUADE BACKERS OF THE MODERATE CASE IT TO LEND THEIR SUPPORT TO CRUISE WHO CLAIMS TO BE THE MOST STAUNCHLY CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE IN THE RACE BESIDES THERE'S NO GREAT TRADITION IN AMERICAN POLITICS OF TACTICAL VOTING
AFTER SIX THUMPING VICTORIES IN NEW YORK ANOTHER NORTH EASTERN STATES TRUMP HAS COME TO THIS MID WESTERN BATTLE GROUND WITH A STRONG WIND AT HIS BACK AT THE POLLS SUGGEST HE'S POISED FOR VICTORY HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM CLAIMS THAT THAT WOULD MAKE HIM THE INEVITABLE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE
AN EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD GIRL HAS BEEN RESCUED FROM THE RUBBLE OF A BUILDING WHICH COLLAPSED FOUR DAYS AGO IN THE KENYAN CAPITAL NAIROBI MORE THAN TWENTY PEOPLE DIED WHEN THE PROPERTY CAME DOWN IN HEAVY RAIN OFFICIAL SPHERE MORE BODIES WILL BE FOUND THE OLYMPIC TORCH IS DUE TO ARRIVE IN THE BRAZILIAN CAPITAL BRASILIA THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE IT'S TAKEN ON A NATIONWIDE TOUR BUT PUBLIC ENTHUSIASM FOR THE GAMES HE'S WAVERING BECAUSE OF GROWING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WE'RE A DAVIS REPORT FROM BRASILIA
WHEN GERMAN RECESS RECEIVES THE OLYMPIC TORCH AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE LATER THIS MORNING IT COULD BE ONE OF HER LAST OF FORMAL AXE AS PRESIDENT BEFORE THE SENATE VOTES NEXT WEEK ON WEATHER TO SUBJECT HER TO A FORMAL IMPEACHMENT TRIAL THE PRESIDENT'S DOWNFALL REFLEX BRAZIL'S DWINDLING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FORTUNES IN THE YEARS SINCE IT WAS AWARDED THE OLYMPIC GAMES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
AND GENERATING PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE RIO GAMES WILL BE ONE OF THE MAIN CHALLENGES DURING THE TORCHES NINETY FIVE DAY JOURNEY AROUND THIS HUGE COUNTRY IT WILL PASS THROUGH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TOWNS AND CITIES FROM THE AMAZON TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER ARRIVING AT THE MOROCCAN A STADIUM IN RIO ON AUGUST THE FIFTH
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THE RICHEST AND THE POOREST MEN IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS INCREASING RESEARCHERS AT THE CASS BUSINESS SCHOOL IN LONDON SAY THE GAP GREW BY ONE POINT SEVEN YEARS BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHEN IT WAS AT ITS NARROWEST AND TWO THOUSAND AND NINE CATRIONA RENTON REPORTS
RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT THE DETAIL OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO DIED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AGED OVER THIRTY THEY FOUND THIS IN ENGLAND AND WALES THE TOP FIVE PER CENT OF MEN REACHED AN AVERAGE AGE OF NINETY SIX THAT IS THIRTY THREE YEARS LONGER THAN THE BOTTOM TEN PER CENT WHO ON AVERAGE LIVE TO THE AGE OF SIXTY THREE MEANWHILE THE LONGEST SURVIVING WOMEN LIVED UNTIL THEY WERE NINETY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE THE LOWEST AVERAGE SIXTY SEVEN
THE AUTHORS OF THE REPORTS SAID MANY OF THE BIG GAINS FROM PUBLIC HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND BETTER HOUSING WHERE IN THE PAST AND THAT PERSONAL LIFESTYLE CHOICES SUCH AS SMOKING AND DRINKING WERE NO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THE STUDY SUGGESTS LACK OF WEALTH IS NOT DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIFFERENCE BUT THE POOREST GROUPS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF DECADES OF POOR LIFESTYLE CHOICES AND INCOME INEQUALITY
FIGURES SUGGEST THAT PARENTS HER OFFERING THEIR CHILDREN SO MUCH FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO BUY A HOME THAT THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED IN A QUARTER OF ALL MORTGAGE TRANSACTIONS THIS YEAR LEGAL AND GENERAL SAYS THE SO CALLED BANK OF MUM AND DAD WILL HAND OVER FIVE BILLION POUNDS ENOUGH TO RANK THEM ALONGSIDE THE U.K.'S TOP TEN MORTGAGE LENDERS THE GROUP'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE NIGEL WILSON TOLD US THIS MODEL WASN'T SUSTAINABLE
IT'S GREAT THE PARENTS ARE WILLING TO DO THIS AND I THINK AS PARENTS WE ALL WANT TO HELP OUR CHILDREN AND IT'S AN ADMIRABLE RESPONSE FROM SOCIETY BUT IT'S NOT A GOOD RESPONSE WE'VE HAD A FAIRLY OF HOUSING POLICY FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IN BRITAIN WE HAVE TO COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY WE MANAGE THE SUPPLY SIDE AT NEW MODERN CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES INTO THE INDUSTRY SO WE COULD MASS PRODUCE HOUSES ON A SCALE THAT WE SAW IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES NIGEL WILSON
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHARLES IT'S TEN PAST EIGHT ON THE MORNING AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE THE CITY OF LEICESTER HAS WOKEN UP BUT NOT WITH A HANGOVER BECAUSE THE PARTY IS FAR FROM OVER THE HALLS BEING BLOWN HERE OUTSIDE THE KING POWER STADIUM TESTIFIED TO THAT
HE'D SIMPLY WASN'T MEANT TO BE POSSIBLE NOT ANY MORE GOLD AND WE WERE TOLD WITH THE DAYS WHEN THE MINNOWS COULD DEFEAT THE MIGHTY MONEY ENORMOUS POTS OF MONEY
HAD SEEN TO THAT NO LEAGUE IN THE WORLD ATTRACTS MORE OF THAT CASH THAN THE PREMIER LEAGUE SO HOW COULD A TEAM LIKE LITTLE LEICESTER CITY EVER HOPE TO COMPETE AGAINST MANCHESTER'S CITY AND UNITED OR LONDON'S CHELSEA OR ARSENAL
BUT COMPETE THEY DID FIRST CONFOUNDING THOSE HE SAID THEY WERE SURE TO BE RELEGATED THEN DREAMING TO DID DARING TO DREAM THEY COULD QUALIFY FOR EUROPE AND FINALLY REALISING THAT THEY WERE TO BE CROWNED
HERE IN THE CHILLY SUNSHINE OUTSIDE THE KING POWER STADIUM A SPORTS EDITOR DAN ROWAN AND ALSO SIR DAVE BRAILLE'S FOOT FORMALLY PERFORMANCE DIRECTOR OF BRITISH CYCLING CURRENTLY GENERAL MANAGER OF TEAM SKY DAN
NOT MEANT TO BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE CASH WHY WALLS
VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK MANY OF US WILL SPEND SOME TIME TRYING TO WORK OUT JUST QUITE HOW LEICESTER CITY DID IT MAKE IS NO DOUBT IT HAS RE ENERGISE THAT MOST BASIC FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF SPORT WHAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE WHICH IS OPEN COMPETITION BUT AS YOU'VE SUGGESTED THE PREMIER LEAGUE HAS BEEN SOMETHING OF A CLOTHES SHOP OR STATUS
ONLY FOUR CLUBS IN FACT HAVE WON IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE CLUB'S YOU MENTIONED THE RICHEST CLUBS AND IN A LEAGUE SO WEALTHY THAT SEEM TO BE THE WAY IT WAS SET
A CITY OF CONFOUNDED ALL THAT FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE SHOT TO WIN THE LEAGUE BEFORE THE SEASON FAVOURITES FOR RELEGATION A SQUAD THAT WAS WORTH A FRACTION OF THE COST OF THEIR RITUAL RIVAL SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST CLUBS IN THE WORLD A MANAGER WHO YOU CAME IN WITH A POINT TO PROVE CLAUDIO RANIERI HAD NEVER WON A MAJOR TITLE
IF SOMEHOW FORGED A COLLECTIVE TEAM SPIRIT THEY'VE RECRUITED INCREDIBLY WISELY
A GOOD SPORTS SCIENCE DEPARTMENT HERE AT THE CLUB THEY HAVE BILLIONAIRE OWNERS OF THEIR OWN
BUT NONETHELESS THEY'VE ONLY SPENT AS I SAY VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNT COMPARED TO THEIR RIVALS SO IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND
DONNA SECOND THEY SAY THE TRUE STORY OF THIS SEASON IS ACTUALLY JUST THAT THOSE BIG FOR UNITED AND CITY AND MANCHESTER JILTED ARSENAL THEY ALL SLIPPED UP FOR DIFFERENT REASONS IT WAS A ONE OFF IN OTHER WORDS AND A WHOLE SERIES OF CLUBS TOTTENHAM COULD'VE DONE IT COULD HAVE COME THROUGH AND SUCCEEDED HE JUST HAPPENED TO BE LESS
IT MAY WELL BE THE CASE IT COULD JUST BE A ONE OFF IN A WAY IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IT'S SOMETHING TO BE ENJOYED FOR WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THOSE BIG CLUBS ARE CERTAINLY IN TRANSITION SOME OF THEM ARE FALTERED BUT I THINK THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNT HERE FOR THOSE CLUBS AND PERHAPS THEY WILL NOW
WORRY LESS ABOUT TRYING TO HIRE OR SIGNED THE BIGGEST AND THE BIGGEST NAMES THEM ON THE BIGGEST FEES AND PUT A BIT MORE EFFORT AND EMPHASIS LIKE LEICESTER CITY OF
LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AT WHICH WAY SOUP THAT CLUB EVEN IF THEY PERHAPS WAS HELD AS OTHERS THIS IS GREAT
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MADE BRITISH CYCLING FOR NOT
WAS THAT PEOPLE IN OTHER SPORTS AND INDEED IN BUSINESS AND OTHER WALKS OF LIFE STARTED TO STUDY WHAT DO YOU DOG THE WAY YOU DONE THINGS IN ORDER TO LEARN FOR THEMSELVES DO YOU THINK
PEOPLE IN OTHER WALKS OF LIFE INDEED FROM CYCLING WILL COME HERE TO THE KING POWER STADIUM AND START TO EXAMINE EXACTLY WHAT RHYNIE ARYAN OTHERS DATE BECAUSE THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNT OH WITHOUT A SHADOW OF DOUBT IN FACT OUR SPORT SCIENCE GUYS WERE APPEAR PROBABLY A MONTH AND A HALF AGO
MEETING WITH THE GUYS HERE JUST HAVE A LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON AND I THINK THAT SPORT WE ALL TRY AND LEARN FROM EACH OTHER WE ALL LOOK AT WHAT THE LATEST THING IS AND THE GREAT THING WAS SUCH A REFRESHING THING I THINK ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR STORY IS THAT IT JUST GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING THE ESTABLISHED NORMS AND THE SORT OF CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
ABOUT HOW TO WIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE IN IT JUST SHATTERS EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY'S ESTABLISHED IT IS JUST AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN LIKE YOU SAY IT'S EARLY EARLY DAYS TO WORK OUT WHAT THE LESSONS ARE ON THE NEW LOOK
WHAT DO YOU BEGIN TO THINK OF THE LESSONS FOR OTHER PEOPLE WELL WE'VE ALL BEEN LOOKING I MUST SAY AND I THINK THERE'S AN OLD SAYING IN SPORT BUT THE STAR TEAM WILL ALWAYS BEAT THE TEAM ARE STARS
AND WE TALK ABOUT THAT'S A LOT SO IT ALL HAD GONE THE TEAM TALKS YOU QUITE OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT AND IT'S VERY RARELY SEEN
BUT I THINK THIS IS A THIS IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT MANY SAY STAR TEAM YOU'VE GOT A LOOK AT THAT THEY NOT ONLY THE THE TALENT THAT'S A BABY THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY AT THE TIME
BUT THE RECRUITMENT OF THAT TALENT HOW DO YOU SAY THAT IF I DON'T TIME HAVING TO PUT IT TOGETHER HOW DID HE GET THE CROW OR CLARITY THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
THE WHOLE PROCESS OF AS THEY WERE GETTING THEIR JOURNEY THEY WENT THROUGH TO EXCITINGLY BUILT MOMENTUM VAL HE'S RUN OF SCORING GOALS THAT GAVE BELIEF AND OFF THOUGH HE COULD SEE THE BELIEF GROWING ALL THE TIME AND SO IT'S JUST A FANTASTIC CAISTER THE FILLER IN THE SPORTS BUSY THE CYCLING CASE STUDY IS ALL ABOUT
AT THE MICRO DETAIL ISN'T IT WE LEARNED THAT WHAT YOU DO WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE BIKE STUDYING EVERY COMPONENT
THE DIET SO IT WHEN PEOPLE DESCRIBE LEICESTER THEY SEEM TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING TERRIBLY OLD FASHIONED A ROY OF THE ROVERS
TEAMS THAT GET OUT FOR A PIZZA TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE NOT LETTING A GOAL IN A TEAM THAT HAS FOUR RATHER THAN GETS TOO WORRIED HAVE WEAVED IT SENSE OVER MANAGERIAL ICE
I THINK I THINK THAT'S A BIT OF THIS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION WITHOUT A DOUBT I THINK YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET DIGS A REAL SPECIFIC WOULD HAVE MISSED THE OBVIOUS AND IT'S A HUMAN THING
YOU DEAL WITH HUMAN BEINGS AND HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THIS SO IMPORTANT AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE QUITE TANGIBLE SCORES WE CAN MAKE BUTTER THERE BYE
ALL THE SORT OF SMALL HEATER CAN CHANGE
THE GROUP DYNAMIC THE HUMAN ASPECT IS AS IMPORTANT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY'VE CONFOUNDED THE PUNDITS LET'S JUST HAVE A LITTLE ROOM
OF WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES AND GOD THEY NEVER DID THIS IN POLITICS BY THE WAY THE WOOD OUR COLLEAGUES ON MATCH OF THE DAY SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF LITTLE LEICESTER CITY
JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE YOU SEE EVERY GAME EVERY GAME IF WHAT'S LESS HE'S NOT SURE WHAT THAT A BIT LUCKY THEY'VE HAD A RIGHT GO ON THE PLANE FOR THE MANAGER OF THE FANS ON THE SIDE THERE JUST TO BE AT THE JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH THAT'S THE R. SEVEN POINTS ADRIFT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF AVOIDING RELEGATION DOWN THEY'RE NOT WINNING GAMES IT'S SIMPLE HOW IN ANY GAME TRYING TO GET RELEGATED
THAT WAS MARK LAWRENSON OR ROBBIE SAVAGE TALKING MIDWAY THROUGH LAST SEASON BEFORE THE LITTLE RUN OF SUCCESS BEGAN FOR THE DEAD RED ALL OF WHICH IS OF COURSE LINK DIRECTLY WE'RE TOLD TO THE BURIAL OF KING RICHARD THE THIRD IN THIS CITY YOU KNOW SEVEN WINS OUT OF NO I'D FOLLOWED THE BURIAL HERE IN THE CATHEDRAL
I THINK THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT I'VE GOT THIS CRAZY THEORIES BUT AT THE ROOT OF IT OF COURSE
YEAH WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN ANALYSE IT ALL DAY BUT THEY HAD VERY GOOD PLAYERS IT'S NOT FORGET THAT JAMIE VADIM BUT APPLY YOU SCORED ELEVEN GOALS SO YOUR GOALS AND ELEVEN GAMES ON THE TROT BREAKING THE PREMIER LEAGUE RECORD IN RIYADH MURRAY'S THEY HAD PLAYER OF THE YEAR
GOAL OR COME TAE AS WELL THE FRENCH MIDFIELDER WAS A WARRIOR ALL SEASON THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL SQUAT IT'LL BE FASCINATING TO SEE NOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN GO ON AND REPEAT THIS SUCCESS MAYBE DO WELL
IN A CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IN EUROPE OF COURSE BUT YES A GREAT SQUAD AND A GREAT MANAGER OF A FIRST
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SUCCESS BUT WE'VE GOT TO TALK WHILE YOU'RE HERE IF WE MAY ABOUT WORRYING TIMES FOR BRITISH CYCLING WE SAW OF COURSE SHANE SUTTON RESIGN LAST WEEK AFTER A SERIES OF CLAIMS OF SEXISM AND DISCRIMINATION AMONGST ELITES CYCLIST
DID YOU KNOW AND IF YOU DIDN'T WHY NOT
WHAT I'D SAY TO THAT IS THIS OBVIOUSLY IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT THIS INQUIRY HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN SO WE CAN ESTABLISH TRUE
I'M GOING TO THE DETAIL SPECIFIC RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT I WILL IS OUT I'LL SHARE EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW THAT WITHOUT INQUIRY IS HEADED BY SOME FANTASTIC PEOPLE
AND THEN WE CAN ESTABLISH EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE OUT BECAUSE I THINK HE'S A PRETTY
THE BEE IS A BIT LIKE WHAT WE WAS HERE WITH WITH LESTER WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GAMES AND WHAT WE SAW WITH A TWO MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF YORKSHIRE THE WEEKEND WITH SIGHTING
NO IT'S IT'S YOU
GET A PERFORMANCE ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS EVERYWHERE
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT YOU KNOW THAT BRITISH SOCIETY MODEL WASN'T BASED AROUND MOTIVATION THROUGH FEAR OF PERFORMANCES
IT WAS ME IT WAS OVER AND THAT THAT'S THE SENSE OF MODEL A FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST WHO HAD ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT IT WAS IN THAT PROBE
AND WE RUN A MODEL WHICH IS VERY MUCH ABOUT OWNERSHIP
AS MUCH OWNERSHIP OF POSSIBLE OVER THEIR CAREERS
YOU WON'T KNOW THAT AFTER JESS VARNISH SAID WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT SHADES ON THE ALLEGED SEXISM A WHOLE SERIES OF OTHER
WOMEN RIDERS CAME OUT INSTANTLY WITHIN DAYS AND SAID YES YES WE RECOGNISE THIS THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED SO WITHOUT GIVING IS THE DETAIL THAT YOU OBVIOUSLY WANT TO HOLD FOR THAT ENQUIRY
ARE YOU SURPRISED BY WHAT YOU HEARD
THE THING ABOUT THOSE DAYS CLAIMS AT THE TIME I THINK WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM THEY NEED TO BE HEARD THEY NEED TO BE DOCUMENTED PROPERLY THE DRESS PROPERLY
BUT IT MIGHT ON A PRETTY SIGHTING BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUT THE TRUCK TRACKER BRITISH I THINK THERE WAS THERE WERE TEN GOLD MEDALS AVAILABLE IN TRACK CYCLING
THREE OF THEM WERE FOR WOMEN SEVEN FOR MEN WE MANAGED TO CHANGE THAT TO FIVE AND FIVE SO WE HAVE PARITY
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THE FEMALE ATHLETES AND YOU KNOW I THINK
FOR MYSELF PERSONALLY I'VE GOT A LOVELY AGA RICHARD
AND I'D LIKE HER TO GET TO SPORT IF YOU GET INTO SPORT I WON'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES OF THE GUYS IN THE CLASS THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THE SAME AS THE GUYS IN THE PAST SO I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD THINK ABOUT THOSE ASPECTS IN THAT THERE MAY BE LESSONS THAT YOU WILL WANT TO TALK ABOUT IN THE FUTURE
THAT YOU HAVE LEARNT AS WELL AS LESSONS I THINK YOU ALWAYS IN LIFE WITH A NIGERIA WHAT DO YOU HAVE LEADERSHIP POSITION LIKE THAT YOU HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE ATHLETES ARE IN THE CARE OF ATHLETES MORE MORE THAN ANYTHING
AND THE WELFARE OF THOSE ATHLETES AND A CAUTION OR PUSH HARD IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS BUT I WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN TO LEARN ANYTHING I CAN'T BUT BRIEF FINAL WORD THE PARTY THAT IS BEGINNING AGAIN BEHIND THIS HERE VANS GEOLOGY WAVING THEIR FLAGS IN THERE LES THAT AS WELL IS A PARA SPORT KNOWN NOTHING ELSE CAN DO THIS BIG PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE POWER AS WELL AS ONE WE LOVE SPORT
TODAY BROWSE FOR DAN ROWAN THANK YOU JOINEES
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT UNIVERSAL CREDIT HAS BEEN ONE OF THIS GOVERNMENT'S BIGGEST REFORMS THE LARGEST OVERHAUL OF THE WELFARE SYSTEM SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES ITS AIM TO ENSURE THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO WORK THE PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER OFF WORKING THAN ON BENEFITS BUT JUST OVER A MONTH AGO ITS ARCHITECT IAN DUNCAN SMITH RESIGNED AS WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY CRITICISING HIS OWN GOVERNMENT NOT LEAST FOR CUTTING AWAY AND ERODING THE INCENTIVES IN THE SCHEME
NOW I THINK TANK THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION RUN BY ANOTHER FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTER SAID IT SAYS IT HAS TAKEN BEEN TAKEN TOO FAR FROM ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE AND HE'S VEERED OFF TRACK BECAUSE OF COST CUTTING AND WARNING THAT COMES AS THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES A FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE SCHEME WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE NEW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB HE JOINS US FROM WESTMINSTER GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DO YOU ACCEPT THAT IT HAS VEERED OFF TRACK FROM THE ORIGINAL
AND NO I DON'T ACCEPT THAT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE EARLY RESULTS COMING THROUGH AND DON'T FORGET WE'VE HAD HALF A MILLION PEOPLE NOW HAVE MADE A CLAIM THROUGH UNIVERSAL CREDIT WE'VE GOT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE CURRENTLY RECEIVING UNIVERSAL CREDIT AND WHEN YOU COMPARE THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH A SIMILAR GROUPS OF PEOPLE RECEIVING THE OLD JOB SEEKER'S ALLOWANCE YOU'LL SEE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON UNIVERSAL CREDIT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SPENDING MORE HOURS LOOKING FOR WORK THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE FINDING WORK AND WHEN THEY FIND WORK THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE EARNING MORE
AND LOOKING TO INCREASE THEIR HOURS TOO SO UNIVERSAL CREDIT IS ALREADY WORKING IT'S DOING WHAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO DO IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE DIRECTION I WILL BE ROLLING THIS OUT NOW IN A MUCH DEEPER FORM ACROSS THE COUNTRY TAKEN CARE AS WE GO TO ENSURE THAT WE ROLL OUT IN A CONTROLLED AND CAREFUL WAY TO ENSURE THAT UNIVERSAL CREDIT ACHIEVED EVERYTHING THAT WE DESIGNED IT TO DO OF COURSE A QUARTER OF A MILLION WHO ARE RECEIVING IT ARE THE SIMPLEST CASES
AND HAVE THE SORT OF CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAY'S NOT LEAST BY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AND NOW BY THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION ARE THAT IT'S IN ONE SENSE THE PUPS THE MORE COMPLEX CASES IT'S WHERE YOU HAVE A COUPLE WHO ARE RETURNING TO WORK WHO THE INCENTIVES
TO NOT ONLY GO BACK TO WORK BUT YOU INCREASED YOUR HOURS HAVE BEEN REMOVED HAVE BEEN ERODED
LET'S JUST DEAL WITH WHAT THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS MORNING BECAUSE WHAT PEOPLE ARE COULD GLOSSING OVER IS THE FACT THAT THEY RECOGNISED THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION IS SAYING THAT UNIVERSAL CREDIT IS A FAR BETTER BENEFIT THAN WHAT WE HAD BEFORE THEY ARE RECOGNISING
UNDER UNIVERSE CREDIT PEOPLE WILL BE BETTER OFF IN WORK AND ONCE YOU RECOGNISE THAT NOBODY'S DISPUTING THAT SO THE CENTRAL CORE PURPOSE OF UNIVERSE THAT AN HOUR AGO AND WE SPOKE TO THEM BLOODY SO YOU ALSO RECOGNISE WHAT THEY'RE ALSO SAYING WHICH IS THAT THE WORK ALLOWANCES NEED TO BE MORE GENEROUS IF IT IS TO WORK WHEN USE EXCEPT THE CENTRAL TRUTH OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND WE'RE SAYING THAT UNIVERSAL CREDIT IS A BIG STEP FORWARD IT'S BETTER
PEOPLE WILL BE BETTER OFF UNDER IT THEN THE DISCUSSION IS AROUND O.K. HOW DO YOU DO THAT AND IT'S QUITE A TECHNICAL DISCUSSION HOW YOU DESIGN THE THE INCENTIVES IN THIS TWO PARTS THAT ONE IS CALLED WORK ALLOWANCE HOW MUCH ARE ABLE TO BURN EACH WEEK BEFORE YOU SEE YOUR BENEFITS GETTING A WRIT WITHDRAWN AND THEN THE TAPIR RATE WHICH IS THE RATE AT WHICH
THE BENEFITS GET WITHDRAWN SUCCESSIVELY AS YOU INCREASE YOUR SALARY NOW THE BIG THING THAT WE'RE DOING THE MOST POWERFUL THING WHICH IS STILL INTACT IS THE REMOVAL OF THAT CRAZY SIXTEEN HOUR RULE WHICH MEANT A LOT OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY WORKING MUMS WOULDN'T BE LOOKING TO INCREASE THEIR HOURS BEYOND SIXTEEN HOURS UNIVERSAL CREDIT SWEEPS THAT AWAY AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S IS THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE COUPLED WITH THE INCREASE IN THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WHICH IS THE MOST POWERFUL INCENTIVE WHICH ACTUALLY OVERRIDES
WHAT THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION ARE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THE CHANGE TO WHAT'S CALLED THE WORK ALLOWANCE O. K. BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN WE DO NOT WANT TO LOSE PEOPLE IN THE TECHNICALITIES OF THIS BUT THEY WERE THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION AS YOU SAY RIGHTLY SAY LOOK THERE IS IT IS STILL THE CASE THAT YOU ARE BETTER OFF IN WORK BUT THEY ARGUE AND IT COMES ON TOP OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHO'S THIS IS HIS BABY
AND THEY WERE CALLING FOR EFFECTIVELY NOT JUST A REVERSAL OF THE CUTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THIS WHICH REMOVE SOME OF THE INCENTIVE BUT ALSO INCREASING PRACTICAL SUPPORT TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THEIR ARGUMENT IS YOU GET YOUR KIDS MOVING TOO FAR AWAY FROM ITS ORIGINAL INTENTIONS
SO THE ISSUE AROUND PRACTICAL SUPPORT IT IS THE BIT OF THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATIONS REPORT THAT I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND IF I'M HONEST BECAUSE I'VE BEEN OUT TO JOB CENTRES AND I'VE BEEN SAT THERE WITH WHAT WE CALL WORK COACHES THE PEOPLE WHO GET ALONGSIDE PEOPLE WHO ARE CLAIMING UNIVERSAL CREDIT AND PROVIDE THEM WITH EXACTLY THAT KIND OF PRACTICAL SUPPORT TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND SUPPORT THEM AS THEY MAKE THE THE TRANSITION BACK INTO WORK AND INCREASING THEIR HOURS AND AND SO FORTH AND THAT PRACTICAL SUPPORT
IS WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM WHERE FRANKLY UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM WHICH IS BASICALLY DUMPED ON BENEFITS YOU'VE GOT YOUR CASH PAYMENT WE CAN WAKE UP AND THAT'S WHAT IT DID NOW THEY OF THE WELFARE SYSTEM IS THAT WE WANT TO SEE PEOPLE MOVING THROUGH IT AND EMERGING ON THE OTHER SIDE FULLY ECONOMICALLY INDEPENDENT SO WE HAVE THESE TEAMS HAVE WORK COACHES
WHO PROVIDE THAT PRACTICAL SUPPORT BUT WE'LL LOOK AT WHAT THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION SAYS ON THIS COS I WANNA UNDERSTAND IT A BIT BETTER BUT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN WHEN I GO TO JOB CENTRES AROUND THE COUNTRY THE MOST MOTIVATED PEOPLE IN A JOB CENTRE WILL BE THE UNIVERSAL CREDIT TEAM BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT AND THEY SEE IT'S DELIVERY DO YOU UNDERSTAND DO YOU YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH PRACTICAL SUPPORT DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT REVERSING THE CUTS
BUT THEN THIS IS THE AT THE ARGUMENT WE WERE HAVING A FEW MONTHS AGO ABOUT WHERE YOU EXACTLY YOU SET THE WORK ALLOWANCE LEVEL WHERE YOU SET THE THE TAPER IT AND AS I SAID IT'S QUITE POWERFUL QUITE A TECHNICAL DISCUSSION AND WHERE I THINK THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION IS FALLING DOWN AND WITH SOME OTHER CRITICS ARE FALLING DOWN IS THAT THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WORLD OF TWO THOUSAND WHEN WE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED UNIVERSAL CREDIT IS TRUE IF WE DID HAVE A HIGHER WORK ALLOWANCE RATE BUT SINCE THEN WE'VE TRANSFORMED THE LANDSCAPE FOR
UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE AND PEOPLE ON LOW WAGES BY TAKING MORE THAN A PIT MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF PAYING INCOME TAX BY THIS BIG INCREASE IN THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WE ARE TRIP LINKED TO THAT THAT THE EXTRA SUPPORT THEY WERE GIVING ON CHILDCARE SO WITH FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THE EQUATION CHANGING THEIR WORK PACKAGE THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE LOOKING TO MOVE INTO WORK AND I THINK THAT THOSE POWERFUL THINGS
OVERRIDE THE CHANGES IN THE WORK ALLOWANCE WITH THEM WHICH THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY YOU TOOK A BIT OF A DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE DEPARTMENT WITH IAIN DUNCAN SMITH RESIGNING OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANNED FOUR BILLION POUNDS CUTS TO DISABILITY BENEFITS WHICH WERE REVERSED BUT WE'RE STILL IN A SITUATION AS FAR AS WE ARE AWARE WHERE WHAT AT LEAST TWELVE BILLION HAS TO BE FOUND FROM WELFARE BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT IS THAT
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO FIND TWELVE BILLION FROM WELFARE BY TWENTY TWENTY WILL THAT TWELVE BILLION HAS LARGELY BEEN FOUND WE'VE ALREADY LEGISLATE IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS TO DELIVER THOSE THOSE SAVINGS THIS STILL A NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT WE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED SHE WOULD LEGISLATE FOR WHICH WILL BE COMING IN OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO
IT WITH REGARDS TO THAT EXTRA MONEY WHICH HAD BEEN TALKED ABOUT BEING SAVED FROM PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS AT THE TIME OF THE PHONE GILLIAN FOUR BILLION WE WON'T NOW BE LOOKING FOR THAT THOSE SAVINGS EQUIVALENT SAVINGS WITHIN THE WELFARE BUDGET THE TREASURY WILL SUCK UP THE COST OF THAT
WELL WE WILL CARRY ON DISCUSSING WITH THE LIST THE TREASURY FORECASTS AND THEY'LL NEED TO WORK WAIT FIND WAYS TO WORK AROUND THAT BUT WE WERE VERY CLEAR IN THE STATEMENT I MADE TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THE DAY AFTER I WAS APPOINTED THAT WE WOULDN'T BE LOOKING FOR AN EQUIVALENT FOR IN THEIR SAVINGS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WELFARE BUDGET
I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT WE'LL CARRY ON TALKING TO THE TREASURY IS THIS IS A RED LINE FOR YOU BUT THAT THAT FOUR BILLION MUST NOT COME FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT WON'T IT TERMS ARE WORKING ALONGSIDE THE TREASURY WHEN YOU HAVE A DEPARTMENT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WORK AND PRENT PENSIONS WHICH THE WOLF'S ALL OVER WHITEHALL DEPARTMENTS A QUARTER OF ALL TAXPAYERS' MONEY IS SPENT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS YOU NEED TO BE WORKING PRETTY CLOSELY WITH THE TREASURY AND THAT'S ONE OF THINGS I'M COMMITTED TO DOING TO ENSURE THAT WE MEET OUR FORECASTS
AND THAT WE MANAGE CHANGES IN A CAREFUL WAY I'M CURIOUS BECAUSE FROM THAT COMMENT IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF IT WILL COME FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT AND YET YOU'VE ALSO SEEM TO BE VERY AWARE OF SOMETHING THAT WAS CERTAINLY GIVEN THE COMMENTS MADE BY YOUR PREDECESSOR ON RESIGNING YOU SAID BEHIND EVERY STATISTIC AS A HUMAN BEING AND PERHAPS SOMETIMES IN GOVERNMENT WE FORGET THAT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY VERY AWARE THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE STATED I WONDER WHAT IT MEANS IN TERMS OF WHAT LINE YOU CAN TAKE WITH THE TREASURY ON THOSE CUTS
IS THAT THE COMMON WHERE I COME FROM AND IN ALL OF THIS FOR ME WHAT MATTERS MORE THAN ANYTHING IS THE REAL LIFE IMPACT ON FAMILIES AND ON INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS SPENT A FEW MINUTES JUST TALK ABOUT UNIVERSAL CREDIT IT WAS A QUITE A TECHNICAL DISCUSSION WHAT WHAT MATTERS MORE THAN ANYTHING IS THE TRANSFORMATION THAT HAPPENS IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND SO THE KIND OF EDICT IF YOU LIKE THAT I'VE SET OUT FOR MY DEPARTMENT WHICH THIS ENORMOUS DEPARTMENT SPENDS A QUARTER OF ALL TAXPAYERS' MONEY
IS TO GET MUCH BETTER ABOUT THINKING ABOUT THE HUMAN IMPACT SO THAT WE REALLY REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THAT A CHANGE TO HAVING FOR THE POSITIVE CHANGES THE BENEFICIAL CHANGES BUT ALSO AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO TREAD MUCH MORE CAREFULLY IN FUTURE STEPHEN CRAB THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW OR HARPIST EIGHT AND HERE WITH THE SPORTS NEWS ON A CHILLY BUT BRIGHT MORNING HERE AT LEICESTER CITY STADIUM ROB BONNET CHILLY BUT BRIGHT SORT MAFIA

A QUICK LOOK AT THE WEATHER AFTER A VERY VERY CHILLY START A BRIGHT DAY WITH SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON LEICESTER CITY FOOTBALL GROUND AND SARAH MONTAGUE IN LONDON AND WITH THE TIME AT TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE SOME OF THE NEWS FROM CHARLES CARROLL AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING LEICESTER CITY FANS AND PLAYERS CELEBRATED LONG INTO THE NIGHT AFTER THE CLUB WON THE PREMIER LEAGUE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE SIDES TIE OWNERS SAY THEY AIM TO KEEP THE VICTORIOUS SQUAD TOGETHER
THOUSANDS OF PRIMARY AGED PUPILS ARE EXPECTED TO BE KEPT OFF SCHOOL IN ENGLAND TODAY AS THEIR PARENTS PROTEST AGAINST THE TOUGHER NEW SATS TESTS THEY BELIEVE THE CHILDREN ARE OVER TESTED MINISTERS SAY THE ASSESSMENTS ARE VITAL
A REPORT HAS WARNED THAT BUDGET CUTS COULD UNDERMINE THE MAIN PURPOSE OF UNIVERSAL CREDIT TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE BETTER OFF IN WORK THE THINK TANK THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION SAYS THERE'S A RISK IT COULD VEER OFF TRACK AND END UP BECOMING A VEHICLE TO CUT THE BENEFITS BILL THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB TOLD US THE NEW SYSTEM WAS WORKING
DONALD TRUMP HAS CLAIMED THAT THE CONTEST TO FIND THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WILL BE OVER IF HE WINS THE INDIANA PRIMARY TODAY HIS RIVAL'S SENATOR TED CRUISE INSISTED HE WAS IN THERE FOR THE DISTANCE
IT'S TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE LORD JUSTICE PITCH FORWARD WE'LL SET UP TODAY HOW HE PLANS TO RUN HIS PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO UNDERCOVER POLICING WHETHER HE WILL ALLOW IS THE METROPOLITAN POLICE WANT SOME POLICE OFFICERS TO KEEP THEIR ANONYMITY OR WHETHER HE WILL INSIST ON EVERYTHING BEING OUT IN THE OPEN THOSE WHO'VE BEEN AFFECTED LIKE HELEN STEEL WHO HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN UNDERCOVER OFFICER AND THE PARENTS ARE STEPHEN LAWRENCE HAVE SAID WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY IT COULD END UP AS A SHAM
WELL EARLIER I SPOKE TO NEVILLE LAWRENCE FATHER OF STEPHEN HE BELIEVES HIS FAMILY WAS SPIED ON DURING HIS SON'S MURDER ENQUIRY ASKED HIM IF HE COULD UNDERSTAND WHY OFFICERS WOULDN'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THEIR IDENTITY BECAUSE OF RISKS TO THEIR LIVES AND THEIR WORK
WELL THEN YOU'RE DIS WHEN THERE ARE TAKING ON THESE JOBS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO WRITING AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS THEMSELVES AND IF THEY ARE GORBY AND WHERE IT IS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE GONE THEN WE HAVE TO HEAR AROUND AND SEE FOR HERSELF AND THEY HAVE TO BE FROM THE CON FOR DOING SOMETHING WHICH IS WRONG AND WHAT IF SOME OF IT IS HEARD IN PRIVATE CAN YOU ACCEPT THAT
IF SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE IN DANGER IF IF YOU REVEAL DEM ACCEPT THAT BUT OTHERWISE FROM THAT NO
A SUIT SO IN SOME CASES IF THEIR NAMES ARE NOT REVEALED AND IF THEIR EVIDENCE IS HEARD IN SECRET THAT MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNTIL WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU MIGHT CONSIDER TO REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE IT'S NOT OPEN ENOUGH BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET TO THE TRUTH YOU KNOW WE NEED TO GET TO A TRUE IT WENT TO THE BOTTOM A WORKMAN'S PEOPLE ARE DOING AND WE'RE DIDN'T FUCK SPEARS
AND PUT PUT ME SOMWHERE FAMILIES AND I'VE A FAMILY'S SHOWED A MEAL YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS STRANGE TREE YEARS AND I'M STILL TALKING ABOUT THE DEATH OF MY SON
I SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS IF YOU HAD DONE YOUR JOB PROPERLY I WOULD BE TRYING TO GET ON WITH MY LIFE
YOU KNOW EVERY TIME I THINK THAT SOMETHING IS AS I WAS ANSWERS THAT HAVE HAD AND SATISFY YOU HEAR SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS
UNFORTUNATE FOR ME IS LIKE GOING BACK TO SQUARE ONE FROM NINETY TREE COMING ALL THE WAY BACK TO BACK
WHAT EVEN THIS LONG LATER YOU FEEL YOU CAN'T GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE BECAUSE I CAN'T BECAUSE AT ALL THIS THIS CASE IF THEY HAD DONE THEIR JOB PROPERLY I THINK THIS CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLVING ENTREE MONTHS IF GOT DONE WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SUPPOSE THEY HAVE CAUSED ME
A LOT OF PAIN AND SUFFERING A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY ARE SKIRTS YOU SAY WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE TRUTH IF THEY'RE OPEN ABOUT THOSE WHO WERE INVOLVED DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THERE MIGHT ALSO BE A WAY TO GET TO THE TRUTH WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVE HAVING EVERYTHING IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THAT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T GET TO THE TRUTH
UNLESS IT'S OPEN TO THE PUBLIC TO HEAR EXACTLY WHAT MADE IT YOU CAN'T DO THAT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN INQUIRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COME OUT IN BUT THE PUBLIC
I'M I'M I'M DIVULGE EXACTLY WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING AND WHAT THEY ARE WHAT WAS STILL MAYBE STILL DOING OF COURSE THESE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO LORD JUSTICE PITCH FORKED OVER THE LAST YEAR DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT HE'S LIKELY TO SAY ABOUT HOW HE'LL HANDLE IT
WELL YOU KNOW I WAS REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THE WAY THE PEOPLE IN IN IN LIVERPOOL HARROGATE THE AIR THE AIR CAMPAIGN AND STOCK TO DEARG ORAINS UNTIL HE GOT WHAT THEY WERE WHAT THEY WANTED TO GET AND TO GET THE KIND OF SOME KIND OF TRUTH AND I'M HOPING THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME
YOU HOPE THAT THIS INQUIRY WILL FINALLY PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME ANSWERS A LOT OF ANSWERS THAT I NEED TO GO TO A LOT I'M HOPING THAT THIS WILL GIVE US
MOST OF IT ANSWER MAYBE THAT HEART OF IT BUT ALSO THEY ANSWERED TO SATISFY ME THAT THERE THE CASE IS NOT AN EVIL EVEN NEAR HAVE CRAWLED BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL
PUPIL WAS INVOLVED IN THE MURDER DUST THAT IN COURT BECAUSE OF COURSE THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PRISON AT THE MOMENT ARE YOU HOPING THAT THIS INQUIRY COULD PROVIDE PERHAPS POINT THE FINGER AT OTHERS
WELL EVEN IF IT'S POINT YOUR FINGERS AS DO I DON'T NEED YOU NEED EVIDENCE AND CONICAL SIEVE EVIDENCE AT ALL TO PUT THEM IN THE DARK
INDEED BUT YOU ARE HOPING THAT THIS WILL PROVIDE PERHAPS MORE ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO STEPHEN WELL I'M HOPING THIS WILL GIVE A LOT OF THE OTHER FAMILIES I MYSELF SOME KIND OF CLOSURE
NEVER LAURENCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRILLIANT THANK YOU
LISTENING TO THAT ON THE LINE IS MICK CREED AND HIS CHIEF CONSTABLE OF DERBYSHIRE CONSTABULARY AND ALSO THE NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF COUNCILS LEAD ON ORGANISED CRIME AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
THERE IS SURELY DEMAND REALLY THAT THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE THAT IS REQUIRED IN THE POLICE MEANS THAT THIS INQUIRY SHOULD BE HELD IN PUBLIC ALL IN PUBLIC
I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION FOR LORD JUSTICE PITCH HAD AND ALL THE PARTICIPANTS POLICE NON CLEESE OTHER AGENCIES AND HOME OFFICE HAVE MADE SUSPICIONS ABOUT THIS AND CLEARLY THERE ARE A HOST OF ISSUES TO BE ANSWERED SOME OF THEM VERY CONTROVERSIAL I THINK THE OVERALL POINT I'D MAKE ABOUT UNDERCOVER POLICING IS THAT THERE ARE
PROBLEMS IN THE PAST THERE HAVE BEEN FAILINGS ARE REPORTED ON THESE NUMBER OF TIMES IN MY INVESTIGATION INTO THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SERVICE BUT THE CONVERSE IS THAT THIS IS A LAWFUL TACTIC IT'S A TACTIC THAT
THE PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE MAKING SUBMISSIONS EXPECTED TO USE THE PUBLIC BUT SHE IS AND WITHOUT IT I'M AFRAID POLICING WILL BE LESSER IN TERMS OF CHALLENGING SOME OF THE BIGGEST EVILS WE DEAL WITH CHOI BUT YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE METROPOLITAN POLICE'S ARGUED WITH IN THIS CASE FOR THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF WHAT IT HAS TO SAY ABOUT UNDERCOVER WORK TO BE HEARD IN SECRET WHICH SURELY RATHER REMOVES THE POINT OF IT BEING A PUBLIC INQUIRY
WHAT AGAIN THE NATURE THE PUBLIC INQUIRIES FOR LODGERS PICTURE AND HIS TEAM THE POLICE SERVICE AND IT ISN'T JUST THE MET POLICE IT'S THE NATIONAL POLICE SERVICE THE SECURITY SERVICE NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY AND THE HOME OFFICE HAVE ALL MADE THE POINT THAT OFFICERS WHO WERE COVERTLY IS UNDERCOVER OFFICERS DO SO
AT SOME RISK THEY DESERVE A PROTECTION NOW I RECOGNISE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE THEIR BEHAVIOUR'S BEEN LACKING AND IT'S BEEN CHALLENGED AND WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IS RESPECT THE DECISION OF THE COURTS AND OUR POLICY OF NOT TO CONFIRM OR DENY AN UNDERCOVER OFFICERS IDENTITY
IS ONE WHICH ULTIMATELY IS TESTED BY THE COURTS THE CIVIL COURT CRIMINAL COURTS AND IN THIS CASE THE PUBLIC INQUIRY AND CLEARLY IF A DECISION IS MADE ABOUT ANONYMITY IT'S WON'T RESPECT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OH KAY SO IF LORD JUSTICE PITCH FRED SAYS LOOK IT'S GOT TO ALL BE IN THE OPEN THE POLICE WILL JUST HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH THAT
AT THE END OF THE DAY HE IS RUNNING THE INQUIRY IT'S AN INDEPENDENT PUBLIC INQUIRY AND WE WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT ISN'T IT SO SHE MADE BECAUSE WHILST THERE HAVE BEEN FAILINGS IN THE PAST WE'RE GOING TO COVER PLACING THERE'S ALSO A BIG ENORMOUS SUCCESSES AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF OFFICERS DO SO DO THE JOB AND DO IT PROPERLY THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE REGION H. MUSHY REPORT SO AN OVERALL BLANKET POSITION OF NO ANA MIDGELY WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT
OH KAY IT'S IT'S WHERE YOU DRAW THE LINE AT WHAT INTEREST IS NEVILLE LAWRENCE CLEARLY MAKES THE POINT OF SOMEBODY SAFETY IS AT RISK SURE THEY'D ACTUALLY THERE SHOULD BE SOME ANONYMITY OR SAW SOME LEVEL OF SECRECY BUT HE ALSO POINTED TO HILLSBOROUGH AND WE KNOW AS A RESULT OF HILLSBOROUGH THAT THERE IS A VERY DEEP CONCERN AND PERHAPS TRUST IN THE POLICE HAS BEEN SHAKEN AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE ADDRESSED IF YOU HAVE LARGE SWATHES CURTAINS DRAWN OVER WHOLE AREAS OF AN INQUIRY
THIS IS A REAL CHALLENGE I KNEW QUITE RIGHT THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN PLACING WHICH IS STILL REMARKABLY HIGH BUT IT WILL BE LESSER IF WE'RE SEEN TO FAIL AND ALSO IF WE'RE SEEN TO DENY THE PROBLEMS OF THE PAST WHICH WE DON'T
MYSELF MY TEAM AND THE NATIONAL POLICE SHE'S COUNCIL IN THE METAL WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE INQUIRY AND OUR DESIRES TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT OFFICERS WHO'D DONE THE JOB WE ASKED THEM TO DO HAVE INFILTRATED GANGS OF TERRORISTS ARMED ROBBERS MURDERERS SOME OF THESE HAVE DONE JOBS THAT PERHAPS THAT WELL EITHER THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO AND THEREFORE THEIR BOSSES SHOULD BE ON THE LINE THEY'VE GONE FURTHER THAN THEY WERE ASKED TO DO IT ON THEIR FIRST CASE IF THEY'VE INFILTRATED GROUPS
BUT IT'S DEEMED TO BE INAPPROPRIATE THAT SOMETHING WHERE THEIR BOSSES DEBT AUTHORISATION PROCESS NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGED IN THE CAN IF YOU READ THE REPORTS I'VE DONE ABOUT THE S.T.S. I'VE TAKEN THIS DANCE COMPLETELY THE SECOND DEMONSTRATION SQUAD YES THAT'S RIGHT IN THE MATCH AND THE SECOND PART TO THE QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT DID THE BROADER RECOGNITION I THINK ABOUT OFFICERS WORK IN THIS FIELD AND THE ENQUIRY IS ONE INTO UNDERCOVER POLICING
NOT JUST THE METS AND THEIR PARTICULAR UNITS AND THE PARAMETERS ARE VERY WIDE SO IT COVERS ALL ASPECTS OF UNDERCOVER POLICE IN NOT JUST THE DOMESTIC EXTREMISM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW JUST ONE QUICK THOUGHT DO YOU THINK NEVILLE LAWRENCE HIS HOPE THAT THERE MIGHT BE ANSWERS THAT GO BACK AS FAR AS THE MURDER OF HIS ON AND WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE DO YOU THINK HE COULD GET THOSE SORT OF ANSWERS FROM THIS
WELL I'VE MET NEVILLE LAWRENCE AND DORY LAWRENCE AND MICHAEL MANSFIELD THEY'RE Q.C. AND TALKED ABOUT THE CASE THERE'S MY REPORT AND ALSO THE REPORTER MARK ALISON Q.C. I REALLY HOPE IT DOES GIVE SOME CLOSURE I THINK
WHAT STRUCK ME IS NEVILLE IS EXTREME DIGNIFIED HE STILL GOING THROUGH THAT TRAUMA SOME TWENTY YEARS LATER AND ANY CLOSURE THAT WE CAN GIVE HIM I THINK WILL BE WITH THE RIGHT THING WHETHER THE ENQUIRY WILL ASSIST WITH FRESH THYME'S WITH RUSTICATION IS NOT SOMETHING I CAN COMMENT ON THAT'S A MATTER FOR THE MET BUT IN TERMS OF THE UNDERCOVER
INTRUSION THAT'S BEEN WELL REPORTED ON I THINK HE DESERVES ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TRANSPARENTLY TRUTH AROUND THIS PLACE BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THE OFFICE ARE HAVING TO GIVE EVIDENCE WHERE HE HAS SEEN BECAUSE OF THE RISKS THAT COULD PUT TO HIM NICK CREIGHTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
IT IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE O'CLOCK WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S HISTORY PLAYS HAVE BEEN FILMED FOR A NEW GENERATION THE BAFTA WINNING FIRST SERIES OF THE HOLLOW CROWN BEGAN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE
THIS MONTH THE KEENLY AWAITED FINAL THREE FILMS WILL BE BROADCAST ON THE B.B.C.
EXECUTIVE PRODUCED BY SAM MENDES AND STARRING THE LIKES OF BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH IT'S A HIGHLY AMBITIOUS PROJECT NOT LEAST IN TERMS OF WHAT SHAKESPEARE HIMSELF CAN STILL TELL US TODAY ABOUT POWER AND LEADERSHIP
NICOLA STAND WHICH MET THAT STAR STUDDED CREW FOR THEIR THOUGHTS ON WHY SHAKESPEARE IS STILL SO RELEVANT FOUR HUNDRED YEAR OLD
THE HOLLOW CROWN THE WARS OF THE ROSES IS AN EPIC TALE OF POLITICAL DISINTEGRATION IN FIFTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND AND HOW RICHARD GLOUCESTER A YOUNG CHILD AND HUNCHBACK GROWS INTO TO SPOT ICH KING RICHARD THE THIRD
IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER BY THIS SUN OF YORK
ALL THE CLOUDS THAT HOWARD UPON OUR HOUSE IN THE DEEP PLUS FEET
THE KING DISCOVERED MORE RECENTLY BURIED UNDER A CAR PARK IN LEICESTER BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH GENEALOGISTS ESTABLISHED IS RELATED TO HIM AND NOW HE'S PLAYING THE PART FIRST TIME YOU'VE PLAYED A RELATIVE
I MEAN A VERY VERY DISTANT RELATIVE BUT I GUESS IT IS I THINK I WAS I'M MORE RELATED THAN OUR CURRENT ROYAL FAMILY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS A LOT TO BE HONEST BUT IT MEANT THAT I WAS THEN AT THE INTERMENT EXTRAORDINARY TO BE PART OF THAT MOMENT LETTING THESE BONES ARREST IT'S ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS ROLLS PRIZED ROLLS FOR ANY ACTOR TO PLAY AND AN EXTRAORDINARY STUDY OF
ABUSE OF POWER OF HOW CORRUPTING AND ISOLATING ALL OUT
WANT OF POWER CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A RICHARD THE THIRD YOU WANTED TO CONJURE UP HIS IMAGE AND HIS LEADERSHIP HOW DID YOU START TO BUILD UP THAT CHARACTER AS A VERY INTELLIGENT CHILD HE'S KEPT IN THE SHADOWS SOMEONE WHO'S OVERLOOKED AS A PHYSICAL SPECIMEN IN A FAMILY THE DOSES OF KENNEDY LIKE PROPORTIONS AND THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE WAS AN UTTER TURMOIL AND HOW KEY INTO ALL OF THESE CHARACTERS IS HOW POLARISING THE VIOLENCE MAKES PEOPLE IT'S ALL OF IT BECOMES ALL ABOUT
I WISH THE BASTARDS DEAD AND I WOULD HAVE HAD SUDDENLY PERFORMED TO THIS DAY THE CENTRAL EVENT WHETHER RICHARD THE THIRD MURDERED THE PRINCES IN THE TOWER REMAINS SPECULATION EXECUTIVE PRODUCER SAM MENDES YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE WHOLE OF
THE HISTORY CYCLE IS AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION HOW DO WE GET TO A POINT WHERE A DESPOTIC RULER KILLS CHILDREN WHAT DOES SHAKESPEARE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND HOW COME WE INTERPRET IT AS SAYING SOMETHING RELEVANT FOR TODAY WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF JEREMY CORBIN OR DAVID CAMERON WILL BE EMPOWERED BY THE END OF THE YEAR LET ALONE THE FORTUNES OF DONALD TRUMP POLITICAL SITUATION AMERICA AT THE MOMENT HOWEVER HORRENDOUS IT APPEARS FROM THE OUTSIDE IT'S CERTAINLY TO ME
YOU CAN'T DENY THAT PEOPLE ARE POLITICALLY ENGAGED WHAT SHAKESPEARE WAS TRYING TO DO WAS TO BRING WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS INTO THE PUBLIC ARENA AND IN THAT RESPECT IT'S AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING DEBATING CHAMBER AND IT WAS ALMOST HIS JOB TO BE AS INCENDIARY AS POSSIBLE AND HERE YOU'VE GOT DOMINIC COOK HIS SKILL AS A DIRECTOR HAS HELPED DRAW A WHOLE GENERATION OF ACTORS
TO THIS PROJECT HE'S YOUR PRISONER TAKE AWAY THERE
O.K. THROWS AWAY HIS CRUTCH BEFORE HIS LEGS BE FIRM TO HIS BODY SHAKESPEARE REVEALS HOW THOSE IN POLITICS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A POWER VACUUM LIKE THE FALL OF THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER PLAYED HERE BY HUGH BONNEVILLE LORD PROTECTOR TO HENRY THE SIXTH
MY FEAR WAS BRONTE'S FATHER DID WORD FOR GOOD GEAR YOU HEN
THERE'S A BALANCE TO BE STRUCK BETWEEN GUIDING HIS PROTECTED AND SETTING HIM FREE LIKE ANY PARENT REALLY ANY PARALLELS WITH MODERN POLITICS
HERE OR ABROAD DID YOU DRAW ON AT ALL DURING YOUR YOUR ACTORS NOTES I THINK THERE'S A VERY CLEAR ECHO REALLY IN OUR CURRENT SOCIETY I THINK HUMPHREY'S AS PROTECTOR WAS PROBABLY TOO LONG AND I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD ADVERT FOR C.E.O.S LEAVING THEIR JOB AFTER TEN YEARS THEY SHOULD DO SEPP BLATTER
LAST WORDS TO BENEDICK COME ABOUT RICHARD THE THIRD WHAT YOU SEE AT THE END OF THESE THIS CYCLE IS A MAN AND HIS FINAL MOMENTS OF FEAR AND ISOLATION RANTING LIKE A MADMAN ABOUT THEY'RE COMING OVER HERE TO TAKE OUR JOBS OUR DAUGHTER'S LITERALLY THOSE OF THE LINES
NOT LITERALLY THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SHAKESPEARE APPARENTLY BUT IT'S A VERY POWERFUL THING TO HAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH WITH YOUR AND WHAT THE AMERICAS GOING THROUGH BETWEEN HIS CHOICES BETWEEN RIGHT AND LEFT I THINK THAT'S WHY WE WERE STILL IN THRALL TO HIM AS A WRITER WERE OF RELEVANCE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS ON SO I'D HAPPY PERT IN RECIPES BUT HE LIVES ON
HE LIVES ON THE VOICE THERE OF COURSE OF BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH IT'S SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE O'CLOCK NOW IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE CURSING THE INVASION OF FOOTBALL INTO A NEWS PROGRAMME I CAN'T OH PHEW RELIEF I'M AFRAID BUT I CAN TRY TO OFFER YOU SOME EXPLANATION OR RATHER I CAN INVITE ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S GREATEST NOVELISTS AND YES A LIFE LONG LIST
