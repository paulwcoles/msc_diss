THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHRIS IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX AND TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE THE MORNING'S PAPERS THE MAIL AND THE SUN GO ON THE SAME STORY THAT'S FIGURES THAT HAVE COME OUT FROM THE O.E.C.D. THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH SHOWED JUST HOW MUCH BRITAIN IS GIVING IN FOREIGN AID AS YOU CAN IMAGINE NEITHER PAPERS PARTICULARLY PLEASED ABOUT THAT THE MAIL HEADLINE
NEW FOREIGN AID OUTRAGE THE PAPERS AS WE NOW PAY A POUND OF EVERY SEVEN POUND GIVEN BY RICH COUNTRIES ONLY THE U.S. HANDS OUT MORE THE SUN'S HEADLINE WAD AS IN WAR W. A. D. WHAT A WASTE IT SAYS FUNDING MORE MADAGASCAN FISH AND IT POINTS OUT THAT
EVEN AMERICA DOES GIVE MORE THAN THE U.K. IF YOU COMPARE PER HEAD OF POPULATION THEY'RE TOTAL SAYS THE PAPER IS SIXTY THREE POUNDS SEVENTY NINE PAIRED A TOTAL IS ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO POUNDS AND TWENTY NINE HEAD INCHED HER YOU CAN'T FIND A PAPERY PUTS US ON THE FRONT PAGE TO SAY WHAT A GOOD THING I THINK
THE GUARDIAN PICKS UP ON SOME EXCHANGES IN PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS YESTERDAY WHEN ANGUS ROBERTS IN THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY'S LEADER IN WESTMINSTER ASKED THE PRIME MINISTER WHY IT WAS THAT THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DEPARTMENT WORK AND PENSIONS STAFF WERE SIGNED TO INVESTIGATE WELFARE FRAUD WHICH COST ONE POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR WHEN ONLY THREE HUNDRED WERE WORKING IN THE REVENUE
TACKLING TAX EVASION BY THE RICH WHICH COSTS ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN THIRTY FOUR BILLION POUNDS A YEAR AT THE RESPONSE PRIMATES AS SHE'S QUITE INTO AS HE SAID THEY FIGURE SOUND ENTIRELY BOGUS BUT THE GOD HE'S DONE A BIT OF DIGGING AND FOUND THAT IT ALMOST EVEN WORSE THAN THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED WHO ARE
PURSUING BENEFIT FRAUDS WHILE SEVEN HUNDRED ARE WORKING AT REVENUE AND CUSTOMS AND THE PRIME MINISTER MAKES THE POINT ASSUMING THAT THE STORY'S WRONG IS THAT THE PREDOMINANT JOB OF THE D.W.P. IS TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS THE PREDOMINANT JOB OF H.M.R.C. IS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE PAY THEIR TAXES AND JUST A QUICK LOOK AT THE STORY WE DID YESTERDAY DIFFERENT PAPERS WITH A VERY DIFFERENT TAKE ON JOHN WHICH B.B.C. SMEARED CABINET MINISTER SAYS THE TELEGRAPH WHERE'S THE MAD DAILY MIRROR HAS DOMINATRIX TORY FACES SLEAZE PROBE WITH
A PICTURE OF THEM NOT MY DOWN A BLACKOUT AND LATEX BUT A FRIEND OF HIS IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST SIX
ADD TO THAT PAUSE WAS CHRIS OF COURSE I SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT SUBJECT WHICH IS THE LINK BETWEEN BIRTH DEFECTS AND THE ZEKE A VIRUS SPREAD BY MOSQUITOS IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AMERICA THE LINK'S BEEN LONG TALKED ABOUT BUT IT'S NOW BEEN CONFIRMED AS YOU HEARD IN THE NEWS BY RESEARCHERS IN THE UNITED STATES I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO A NORTH AMERICAN CORRESPONDENT LAURA PICK UP
WHAT THEY'RE SEEING HERE UNITED STATES IS THAT THEY FOUND TRACES OF THE SEEKER FIRAS IN SPINAL FLUID IN BRAIN TISSUE AND AMNIOTIC FLUID OF THESE BABIES WITH MICROCEPHALY THAT LEADS THEM TO CONCLUDE DEFINITIVELY THAT THE ZUCKER VIRUS IS NOW CAUSING MICROCEPHALY IN BABIES
YEAH IN BRAZIL AND OBVIOUSLY ELSEWHERE NOW THE REASON IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS THEY SAY THAT IT HELPS US UNDERSTAND THE VIRUS A BIT MORE IT CAN BE GAY GATE SOMEONE MYXOMA CLEAR AT THE MESSAGING AND WE CAN REALLY FOCUS ON THE RESEARCH AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND TRY TO FIND THAT KEY VACCINE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE IN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO EITHER PREGNANT OR OF COURSE OR I WOULD SAY AT RISK OF GETTING PREGNANT YOU WOULD NORMALLY SAY THAT BUT IN THIS CASE YOU MIGHT
I THINK CERTAINLY THE ADVICE FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION HAS BEEN RIGHT FROM THE START IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT GETTING PREGNANT IF YOU ARE ALREADY PREGNANT THEN DO NOT TRAVEL TO AFFECTED AREAS NOW THERE ARE MORE THAN FIFTY COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY THE CAR VIRUS SO I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE LINK
SO THAT THEY CAN GUIDE WOMEN AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST DO NOT TRAVEL IF THEY CAN GUIDE THEM A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AND DISCOVER WHEN WITHIN THE PREGNANCY THAT THE MICROCEPHALY IT HAPPENS THEN THEY CAN TAKE IT A LITTLE STEP FURTHER AND FIGURE EH IS THAT A VACCINE AS OR SOMETHING WE CAN DO IT THAT TIME TO PREVENT THIS HAPPENING AND I THINK THE OTHER PROBLEM THEY'RE HAVING IS
IS THIS GOING TO SPREAD FURTHER AT THE MOMENT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FEAR ALREADY THIS WEEK WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE CENTRE FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION THAT THE ZEKE OF IRIS IS SCARIER THAN FIRST THOUGHT IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THIS IS A VIA THIS HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR THIS IS NOT A NEW VIRUS BUT THIS LINK BETWEEN MICROCEPHALY AND BIRTH DEFECTS IN BABIES IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S BOTH BAFFLED AND US WORRYING SCIENTISTS LAURA BECA THANK YOU
TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX AND ZEKE ARE OF COURSE AFFECTING BRAZIL WHERE THERE'S ANOTHER STORY WE'RE FOCUSING ON A POLITICAL ONE BECAUSE TO FORM A COALITION PARTNERS OF THE PRESIDENT THERE DE MARIE SEVEN HAVE SAID THEY WILL VOTE FOR HER IMPEACHMENT OVER ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION WELCOME EL ACOSTA IS A REPORTER WITH THE B.B.C.'S BRAZILIAN SERVICE AND SHE'S HERE NOW AND CAMILLA ARE FROM THE LOOK OF THIS SHE WHAT WILL BE OUSTED
IS VERY LIKELY IT LOOKS VERY LIKELY AT THIS POINT BUT WE DO HAVE VERY MINOR THINGS ARE MOVING VERY FAST IN BRAZIL JUST ON MONDAY THE GOVERNMENT SEEMED QUITE HOPEFUL THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TOGETHER VOTES THEY NEEDED TO AVOID IMPEACHMENT PROCESS IN A BROADER A VOTE IN THE LOWER HOUSE OF CONGRESS BUT NOW JUST ONE DAY AWAY FROM THE BEGINNING OF THEIR VOTE IN IT WAS ACTUALLY THREE PARTED AS WHAT JUST LEFT OVERNIGHT SO MANY OF HER FORMER
OUR EYES ARE JUMPING THE BOAT SO TO SPEAK IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY GOOD SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE WORKERS' PARTY WHICH IS PRESIDENT DO ALL SERVICE PARTY ALREADY STARTED TO SPEAK EITHER EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE SHY ABOUNDED ABOUT SOME POSSIBLES AND AREAS IF SHE IS OUTED
O.K. AND IF SHE IS OUTED WHO'S LIKELY TO REPLACE THE VICE PRESIDENT MICHEL DEMO WE DO I MEAN THIS IS THE BEGINNING IN A WAY OF THE PROCESS WE TO BEAR IN MIND IT'S STILL A LONG PROCESS EVEN THOUGH FROM NOW ON IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO MOVE FAST IF THE LOWER HOUSE OF CONGRESS APPROVES THE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS THAN A GHOST OF THE SENATE IF THE SENATE APPROVED THAT AS WELL
THEN SHE COULD BE SUSPICIOUS SUSPENDED FROM OFFICE HER VICE PRESIDENT TAKES OFFICE WHILE THE SENATE DELIBERATES ON HER IMPEACHMENT THERE COULD TAKE UP TO SIX MONTHS IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE A LOT LESS THAN THAT INTERESTING THING IS THAT WHILE SHE HASN'T BEEN FORMALLY ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION HER VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN IMPLICATED ON SOME OF THOSE ACCUSATIONS IF THIS IS ABOUT CORRUPTION IT'S NOT GOING TO NECESSARILY SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS AS ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS THAT BRAZILIANS ARE ASKING THEMSELVES RIGHT NOW OF COURSE BRAZIL
HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A HUGE INVESTIGATION PROBE INVOLVING ITS OIL STATE COMPANY BUT PRESIDENT DO MILES SOUTH HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF MAKING BAD DECISIONS EGG IN ECONOMY AND A FIDDLING WITH THE BRAZILIAN BUDGET THING IS THAT THE NAME OF A VICE PRESIDENT IN THE NAMES OF THE LOWER HOUSE LEADER AND THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HAVE BEEN IT THE HEAVILY IMPLICATED IN SOME CASES
IN THAT CASE SO BRAZILIANS WILL REALLY WONDERING YOU KNOW SOME SOME MARKET ANALYSTS LIKE TO SAY THAT BRAZIL WILL BE ABLE TO START HEALING AFTER IT IF PRESIDENT DE MO SURFERS OUT OF OFFICE BUT WHAT DOES GILI MEANS IF THIS PARTY IS A PART OF THIS COMING TO POWER WILL THEY WANT THE KS SUPREME COURT BREATHING DOWN THEIR NECKS WE DON'T KNOW
CAMILLA COSTA THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS A QUARTER PAST SIX COULD BE A LONG EGLI TIME AT THE B.P. ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING TODAY AS ROB YEUNG TELL US YES IT COULD INDEED BECAUSE B.P. IS FACING CRITICISM FROM SHAREHOLDERS AND THE LEADING BUSINESS ORGANISATION OVER ITS DECISION TO PAY ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE BOB DUDLEY ALMOST FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS
SOME CITY INVESTORS HAVE SAID THEY'LL VOTE AGAINST THE PAY PLAN AT THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING TODAY WANT TOLD THIS PROGRAMME A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO THE PAY WAS UTTERLY EXTRAVAGANT AND THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS NO LESS HAVE ISSUED A RARE PUBLIC CRITICISM OF A LARGE U.K. COMPANY SAYING THAT THE B.P. BOSSES PAY PACKAGE WILL SEEM UNJUSTIFIED TO MANY SHAREHOLDERS CONSIDERING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY B. P. MADE A RECORD LOSS HALF
BILLION POUNDS LAST YEAR AND HER SLASHED THOUSANDS OF JOBS AS THE OIL PRICE HAS PLANTS OR WITH ME IS TIM BUSH THE HEAD OF GOVERNANCE AT THE INVESTORS ADVISORY CONSULTANCY PERK IT'S ADVISED SHAREHOLDERS TO VOTE AGAINST THE PAY PACKAGE AND ALSO HAVE MARK FREE BENT A PARTNER OF THE HEADHUNTERS ODD COS BURNED SIR GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING TIM
IF FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS IS THE WRONG FIGURE FOR BOB DUDLEY'S TOTAL PAY INCLUDING HIS PENSION WE SHOULD SAY WHAT'S THE RIGHT FIGURE IN YOUR VIEW I THINK OF SOMETHING LESS WHO'S PAY'S GONE UP THIS YEAR WHEN THERE'S NOTHING TO INDICATE WHY PAY SHOULD HAVE GONE UP THE SHARE PRICES DOWN IT'S MADE A RECORD LOSS I THINK THE PROBLEM WE SEE IS
ONE OF THE FORMULA USED TO GENERATE PAY IS GOING TO PRODUCE THE WRONG NUMBER IT'S A CASE OF GARBAGE IN GARBAGE OUT THAN THE MEASURES DO NOT REFLECT THE EXPERIENCE THAT SHAREHOLDERS WHO LOOKING FOR LONG TERM SHIRT SHAREHOLDER VALUE WANT TO GET OUT OF THE COMPANY RIGHT SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S WORTH TWELVE MILLION TEN MILLION I WOULDN'T WANT TO GO FOR THE PRICE BUT CERTAINLY WHATEVER HE'S BEING PAID IS NOT AT FAIR MARKET CLEARING PRICE IS BEING PAID BY A FORMULA
NOT HIS MARKET CLEARING PRICE PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE YEAR'S PERFORMANCE OH KATE MARK FREE BEN IT IS FORTY MILLION POUNDS ABOUT THE RIGHT FIGURE
IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO GIVE YOU A PRECISE ANSWER THAT ON THE BASIS THAT WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO CONSIDER IS WHAT IT WOULD COST THE ORGANISATION TO REPLACE HIM IN A GLOBAL MARKET PLACE WHERE GLOBAL BUSINESSES ARE PAYING LEADERS OF THEIR ORGANISATIONS THAT SORT OF REMUNERATION I THINK YOU ALSO HAVE TO FACTOR IN THAT THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE FOR B. P. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SCENT FOR SETTING THE REMUNERATION POLICY AND WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THAT TO A CHILD TODAY
AND I'M SURE THEY'LL TRY TO MAKE I'LL COME BACK IN A MOMENT MARK WANT TO EXPLORE TIM'S ARGUMENT A BIT MORE BECAUSE THE POINT WHICH IS RAISED THERE'S THAT SHAREHOLDERS DID APPROVE THE COMPANIES PAY POLICY TWO YEARS AGO UNTIL HE CAN'T REALLY COMPLAIN CAN THEY BUT AS PROBLEM THAT THERE'S A THREE YEAR ROLLING CYCLE FOR THE BINDING VOTES AND EVERY OTHER YEAR THERE'S THE NON BINDING VOTE SO REALLY THE FACT THE SHELVES APPROVED THE SCHEME THREE YEARS AGO IS WHY
WELL I'M HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT
PACKAGES PRODUCING ON SHAREHOLDERS ACTUALLY REALLY COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PLUMS IN THE PRICE OF OIL AN EXTERNAL FACTOR OVER WHICH BOB DUDLEY HAS ZERO CONTROL
YEAH I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THEY WERE PRICED PROBABLY USE OUT OF HIS CONTROL WHAT IS INTERESTING WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE SCHEMES AND FUR TIMES WE DON'T HEAR THE CONVERSE THAT THE OIL PRICE RISE WAS OUT OF CONTROL AND THAT THEN FEEDS INTO THERE FROM YOUR NARRATION SCHEMES IN A IN A DIFFERENT WAY THE PAY MODEL HAS BROKEN BASICALLY
IF YOU PAY TOO LITTLE THOUGH FOR A COMPANY CHIEF EXECUTIVE ISN'T THERE A RISK THAT YOU GET SOMEBODY WHO IS JUST NOT UP TO THE JOB AND THIS IS A COMPANY LIKE MANY BIG COMPANIES WHICH AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS WILL RELY ON FOR THEIR PENSION CLEARLY IS PUT THOSE THERE ARE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY EXECUTIVES WERE BOTH RECRUITED AND PRAYED DURING
PROMINENT COMMISSION FOR BANKING STANDARDS I THINK IT WAS LORD LAWSON SAID THAT HEAD HUNTERS AND RECRUITMENT CONSULTANTS WERE PROFESSIONS THAT MAKE PROSTITUTION RESPECTABLE AND THE THE THE PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH HEAD HUNTING IS ACTUALLY BUT IT'S NOT DOING WHAT A NORMAL MARKET WOULD DO WHICH IS ACTUALLY
TRYING TO FIND HOW MANY CANDIDATES ARE OUT THERE WHO ACTUALLY WANT TO APPLY FOR THE JOB AS OPPOSED TO WHAT LAWSON LORD LAWSON SAID IS PRESENTING A LIMITED NUMBER OF CANDIDATES WHO APPEARED TO BE THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD
MARK THREE BURNER HEAD HUNTER DOESN'T LOOK BEST PLEASED WITH THAT DESCRIPTION OF HIS PROFESSION WHEN I THINK ABOUT CHANGING PROFESSION BUT AT LOOK I THINK I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT ARE WORTH BEARING IN MIND ONE OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE QUALITIES OF WORKING WITHIN THE U.K. FRAMEWORK IS THE GOVERNMENTS BY WHICH BUSINESSES ARE ROTTEN AND THE ISSUE OF COMPLY AND EXPLAIN
HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT OFTEN THERE IS A DEFINITE VIEW FROM A NUMBER OF THE RENT CO CHAIRS THAT THAT WE NOT SUPPOSED TO REMUNERATION COMMITTEE YES REALLY I SHALL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN THAT WHILST THERE'S NEVER BEEN MORE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES THERE IS A CLEAR FOCUS FROM THE INVESTOR COMMUNITY ON COMPLYING RATHER THAN EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT CLEARLY WHAT IT CREATES IS A NEED TO FALL BACK ON
A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD FORMULA THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AGREED TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AND IT LEADS TO AN INABILITY TO CHANGE THAT TO REFLECT CERTAIN EVOLVING MARKET CONDITIONS YOU ALMOST AGREEING WITH VICTIM BUSH THEN WEAR AT A TIME WHERE A COMPANY HAS RECORDED THE RECORD LOST IT SEEMS SLIGHTLY BARMY IS THAT THAT THE BOSS IS GIVEN A TWENTY PERCENT PAY RISE NO I THINK THE CHALLENGES THAT THE ORGANISATION HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO WORK WITHIN THE REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK THAT HE'D AGREED TWO YEARS AGO AND WHICH SHAREHOLDERS AGREED TO
IF THE EYE DI THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS IS NOT HAPPY WITH THE PAY OF AN EXECUTIVE AT ONE OF OUR TOP COMPANIES DOESN'T THAT SUGGEST THAT THE PAY IS JUST TOO HIGH
NO IT SUGGESTS THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT A SCENARIO AND CREATING COMMENT OUT OF IT THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT I KNOW IF B. P. LOST BOB DUDLEY IT WOULD LOSE IT TO A COMPETITIVE ORGANISATION AT REMUNERATION WOULD BE A. PART OF THAT CONVERSATION
WHATEVER ANYONE MAY THINK HEAD HUNTERS SPEND THEIR LIVES PORING OVER ANYONE IN BUSINESS WHO'S AVAILABLE AND CREDIBLE ENOUGH TO DO A ROLL AND WHILST ONE OF THE ATTRACTIVENESS IS OF THE JOB IS THE CHALLENGE IN DOING IT REMUNERATION IS A PART OF THAT AND IF YOU OPERATE IN A GLOBAL MARKET THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY ON A GLOBAL SCALE B.P. WASN'T AN ATTRACTIVE ROLE WHEN BOB DUDLEY TOOK IT OVER IT WAS ARGUABLY ON THE FLOOR
AND MANY WOULD SAY THAT HE'S DONE A GOOD JOB IN RESCUING IT OH CABLE B. P. SAYS THAT DESPITE THE VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT IT SAFETY AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE WAS EXCELLENT THROUGHOUT TWENTY FIFTEEN AND ITS PERFORMANCE ARE PAST THE BOARDS EXPECTATIONS ON ALMOST ALL OF THE MEASURES THAT DETERMINE REMUNERATION AND THE OUTCOME THEREFORE REFLECTS THAT TIM BUSH AND MARK FEVER THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH WILL A MARKETS GUEST THIS MORNING IS EWAN CAMERON WHAT THE GLOBAL CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT BLACKROCK GOOD MORNING MORNING ROB WHAT'S YOUR VIEW VERY BRIEFLY ON THE B. P. PAY ROW
I'M NOT GONNA BE SPECIFIC BUT I THINK THE POINT ABOUT HAVING A REALLY SENSIBLE FRAMEWORK ABOUT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF THE BUSINESS IN THAT SETTING THE REMUNERATION
IT'S DIFFICULT TO DISAGREE WITH THAT THAT'S AN ENTIRELY FAIR POINT O.K. THE HEADLINE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIS MORNING HIS CELL A BS AT A LOSS SAYS OUTGOING TREASURY HEAD THEY'VE BEEN TALKING TO SIR NICHOLAS MACPHERSON WHO IS STEPPING DOWN FROM THE TREASURY THE QUOTES IN THE STORY DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT THE HEADLINE BUT HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING THAT SELLING AT A LOSS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DOES THAT SEEM SENSIBLE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF B'S THE SHAREHOLDERS THE CHANT THE ONES THAT AREN'T THE GOVERNMENT OF COURSE
THE CHANCELLOR'S ALREADY FLAGGED THAT THIS IS THE INTENT IN THIS IN THIS PARLIAMENT
THE PROBLEM WITH A BSL IS THE SINS OF THE PAST ARE STILL COSTING A LOT NOW SELLING IT AT A LOSS IS A POLITICAL ISSUE FROM A BUYER'S POINT OF VIEW THE PRICE IT COMES OUT THE POINT AT CYCLE IS THE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION
THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL FOR THE YEAR SO FAR BUT GIVEN ALL THE GLOOM THAT'S BEEN COMING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THIS WEEK WHY DO YOU THINK INVESTORS OR SEEMINGLY SO OPTIMISTIC RISING OIL PRICES AND THE EYEMOUTH AS ESSENTIALLY CATCHING UP WITH A NEW CYCLE
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE ASSUMPTION OF LOWER GROWTH FOR SOME TIME NOW I THINK THE HIGH OIL PRICE THE FACT THAT THERE'S A BIT OF STIMULUS COMING THROUGH IN CHINA
THE BUSINESSES AREN'T COLLAPSING DESPITE ALL PESSIMISM HAS LAIN BEHIND THE COLOUR TEN TWELVE PER CENT RICE FROM THE LOWS IN FEBRUARY EXTRAPOLATING THAT FORWARD
WHICH IS OF COURSE THE REAL QUESTION MAYBE TRICKIER FROM HERE RIGHT SO THAT RISING OIL PRICE I THINK IT WENT DOWN TO GET A BIT YESTERDAY UP IN PRETTY VOLATILE OF LATE DOES IT HAS BEEN FOOT FOR MUCH OF THIS YEAR IS THERE ANY CLEAR INDICATION YET OF WHETHER IT HAS BOTTOMED OUT AND IT IS ONLY HEADING UPWARDS I THINK WE'VE SEEN THE BOTTOM
THE PRICE AT THE MOMENT HE'S BEING DRIVEN IN THE SHORT TERM BY WILLOUGHBY WILL THERE WON'T THERE BE AN AGREEMENT ON SUNDAY BETWEEN THE OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES TO TO FREEZE PRODUCTION WE'VE SEEN THE BOTTOM BECAUSE AT THIS PRICE IT'S STILL A REAL STRUGGLE FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY GLOBALLY AND CAPACITIES MAKE UP BACK TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS OR PRODUCTS
AND CANCELLED THAT IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE SO I THINK WE'VE PROBABLY SEEN THE THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THE SUPPLIES SIDE HAS BEEN CUT BACK BUT IT'S A SLOW AND UNCERTAIN FALL FORWARD OUTLOOK O.K. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH AFFECTS ALL BUSINESSES AND THAT IS I.T. SECURITY THE PANAMA PAPER SCANDAL IS IT SEEMS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A DATA BREACH AT A COMPANY AND THE DAMAGE TO HER BUSINESS'S REPUTATION CAN BE SEVERE
THE TALK WAS SUBJECT TO A CYBER ATTACK MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS LEFT WITH US IS DAVID AND THE PRINCIPAL SECURITY RESEARCH AT CASPER SKI LAB WHICH MAKES ANTI VIRUS SOFTWARE MORNING DAVID GOOD MORNING ROB ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED THESE KIND OF ATTACKS DONE WRONG IS IT ESSENTIALLY THEY HAVEN'T INVESTED ENOUGH IN I.T. SECURITY
I THINK TO A LARGE DEGREE IT'S A QUESTION OF APPROACH TO SECURITY SO THE TRADITIONAL APPROACHES LET'S SEE LOOK THE PERIMETER TO STOP PEOPLE GETTING IN AND I THINK COMPANIES NEED TO BE MORE ADAPTIVE AND WORK IN TERMS OF
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET IN AND IF THEY DO HOW DO WE ACTUALLY MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THAT SO WHAT DO WE DO TO SECURE WHAT ASSETS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IF SOMEBODY BREACHES THE PERIMETER THEY DON'T ACTUALLY GET AWAY WITH ALL THE GOODIES SO TO SPEAK TO YOUR SAYING THAT BREACH OF THE
PREDATOR WILL HAPPEN TO OUR BUSINESS AT SOME POINT THERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF ONE HUNDRED PERCENT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS HUNDRED PER CENT SECURITY DEBORAH PLUNKETT FROM THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY IN THE U.S. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SAID WE NEED TO REALISE THERE'S NO SUCH THING A SECURITY AND WHAT SHE MEANT WAS WE NEED TO WORK ON THE BASIS THAT IF SOMEBODY IS DETERMINED ENOUGH THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BREACH THAT OUTER WALL
THERE'S NO SUCH THING A SECURITY THAT'S QUITE SOMETHING ON HER OWN I.T. SECURITY COMPANY TO SAY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SECURITY I THINK THAT OF COURSE THERE'S SECURITY THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT SOMETHING CAN BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT EFFECTIVE AND I THINK WE WORK ON THE BASIS THAT
WHAT STEPS DO WE NEED TO TAKE IN ADDITION TO SECURING THE PERIMETER TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT VALUABLE ASSETS WE HAVE DON'T GO ASTRAY AND THAT MEANS PASHING INSULTING PASSWORDS IT MEANS USING ENCRYPTION IT MEANS MONITORING ACTIVITY ON THE NETWORK TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HE MEANS COORDINATING WHAT'S HAPPENING ON END POINT WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE NETWORK
CAMERON WHAT DO YOU GET THE SENSE WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN COMPANIES TO TIP YOUR BIGGEST COMPANIES THAT THEY TAKE ICY I.T. SECURITY INCREDIBLY SERIOUSLY PARTICULARLY AT A BOARDROOM LEVEL YES I THINK THEY DO I THINK THAT BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT NO I.T. SECURITY AS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT
IT WAS GUARANTEED BUT YES I THINK HE'D TAKE IT INCREDIBLY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE THE THE TRUST WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS THEIR TRUST WITH THE SHAREHOLDERS WE'VE SEEN C.E.O.S IN AMERICA WERE USING THEIR JOBS OVER THERE OVER THIS PROCESS SO I THINK HE'S WELL UP PEOPLE'S LIST
OH KAY YOU INCOME A LOT FROM BLACKROCK AND DAVID FROM CASPER SKILL UP THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU ROB IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX ANOTHER OF ROBBEN IS HERE NOW WITH THE SPORTS NEWS YES THEY WERE ON THEY CARE FOR ALL THE DISAPPOINTMENTS THE SEASON FOR MANCHESTER UNITED FANS THERE'S DEFINITELY BEEN ONE YOUNG MAN WHO'S GIVEN THEM SOMETHING TO CHEER

THANK YOU SUSAN EIGHTIES TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN A QUESTION ASKED FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT'S BEEN WHEN WILL THE LABOUR LEADER MAKE THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. WELL AS YOU WERE JUST HEARING TODAY IS THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION NORMAN SMITH IS A A SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR AND JOINED US ON THE LINE NORMAN MORNING TO YOU WE KNOW HE VOTED NO IN SEVENTY FIVE WE KNOW HE VOTED AGAINST SEVERAL E.U. TREATIES HOW WILL MISTER CORBIN EXPLAIN HIS CONVERSION
WELL HE WILL ARGUE THAT EUROPE HAS CHANGED THAT IT IS NOW A EUROPE MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON PROTECTING PAY AND JOBS AND PUBLIC SERVICES AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND IS THEREFORE A EUROPE WHICH SHE IS MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH BUT HE WILL ALSO I THINK RATHER TELLINGLY SAY HE WANTS PEOPLE TO SUPPORT EUROPE QUOTES WARTS AND ALL WHICH RATHER POINTS TO HIS CONTINUING
AMBIVALENT VIEW FRANKLY TOWARDS THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE ONE SENSES THAT MY ORGAN HAS NEVER ENTIRELY SHED THE ESTABLISHED VIEW ON THE HARD LEFT GOING WAY BACK TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS ESSENTIALLY A BIG BUSINESS CLUB DESIGNED TO BENEFIT BIG COMPANIES TO FURTHER DEREGULATION AND PRIVATISATION AND HE'S NEVER REALLY
I SHIFTED FROM THAT FEW BUT ON THIS ISSUE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TODAY'S SPEECH IS ACTUALLY AS MUCH ABOUT POLITICAL NECESSITY AS IT IS ABOUT ANY POLITICAL CONVERSION BY JEREMY CORBIN AND THE POLITICAL NECESSITY IS SIMPLY THIS EUROPE IS IN THE MAINSTREAM OF THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF LABOUR M.P.S AND ON THIS ISSUE UNLIKE SAY OVER TRIDENT IT'S SIMPLY POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
FOR JEREMY CORBIN TO GO AGAINST THE TIDE SO MY SENSE IS THAT HE IS BEING PUSHED AND PRODDED TO GET UP THERE AND MAKE A PRO EUROPEAN SPEAK FRANKLY ACTUALLY THE FIRST PRO EUROPEAN SPEED I CAN EVER EVER RECALL HIM MAKING BUT HE'S BEEN FORCED TO DO SO BY HIS PARTY AND NECESSITY THERE WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT NORMAN IS IT BEGS THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS SORT OF IT'S IN OTHER WORDS DO YOU DO WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO BE SEEN TO BE
DOING OR DO YOU ACTUALLY PURSUE A CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IT MUST BE MIGHTY TEMPTING FOR LABOUR TO SAY THIS LOOKS IT SOUNDS IT FEELS LIKE A TORY CIVIL WAR LET HIM GET ON WITH IT I THINK THAT IS PART OF THE REASON MISTER CORBIN'S HELD BACK AT ONLY PART OF THE REASON THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE SEEN TO BE CAMPAIGNING ALONGSIDE MY AND MAKING THE SAME SORT OF MISTAKES THEY BELIEVE LABOUR MADE IN THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM BUT THE THOUGHT THAT JEREMY CORBIN MIGHT ADOPT A RATHER SEMI DETACHED APPROACH TO THIS REFERENDUM
HE'S HUGELY ALARMING TO LABOUR M.P.S WHO ARE ALREADY DESPERATELY ANXIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE LABOUR VOTE IN THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND BLUNTLY THEY FEEL IT IS NOT BEING ENGAGED NOT BEING MOBILISED BY JEREMY THAN THAT IT IS CRITICAL TO THE OUTCOME OF THIS REFERENDUM BECAUSE THE TORY VOTE IT IS THOUGHT LARGELY SUPPORT BRECK'S AT THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO GET THE LABOUR VOTE OUT AND WHEN YOU TALK TO LABOUR M.P.S THEY SAY IT'S NOT MERELY A SOFTER VOTE
IT IS A VOTE WHICH IS SHIFTING SHIFTING IN PART BECAUSE OF ISSUES OF IMMIGRATION WHEN YOU TALK TO LABOUR M.P.S IN WALES THEY SAY THE STEEL CRISIS HE'S HAEMORRHAGING SUPPORT FROM THE PRO LABOUR Y. YOU CAMPAIGN AND MORE BROADLY WHEN PEOPLE SEE ON THE TELEVISION SCREENS PICTURES OF TERRORISM AND REFUGEE CRISIS IN THE REST OF EUROPE THAT IS PROFOUNDLY DAMAGING THE LABOUR VOTES TO THE THIS HUGE JOB OF WORK TO GET THE LABOUR VOTE OUT NO ONE'S READ THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL BE TALKING TO HILARY BENN MATRON
IT'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS THAT'S HOW MUCH THE BOSS OF B. P. IS ASKING TO BE PAID THAT'S A TWENTY PERCENT PAY RISE WHEN IT'S GETTING RID OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS AND POSTING A RECORD LOSS SHAREHOLDERS WILL VOTE ON IT TODAY JONTY BLOOM IS A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT AND DON'T EVEN THE EYE OH DEAR SAYING THEY SHOULD VOTE AGAINST IT ARE THEY LIKELY TO PUT IT THROUGH THE EYE OH DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER WHETHER TO TO OUR SUPPORTERS OR NOT AND THAT IS QUITE AN INTERVENTION FOR
WHAT'S REALLY THE MOST FREE MARKET BUSINESS ORGANISATION ONE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT DIRECTORS OF COMPANIES LIKE B.P. HOWEVER THIS IS ONLY BOYS RE VOTE THERE THE PACKAGE THAT MAJOR DIRECTORS AT B.P. IS AGREED EVERY THREE YEARS BY THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THAT DID THAT THIS YEAR ISN'T ONE OF THOSE YEARS IT'LL GO AHEAD HOWEVER THEY VOTE WELL UNLESS THERE IS SUCH A ROW OVER IT THAT THEY DECIDE TO COMPROMISE OR MAKE A CONCILIATORY GESTURE
THEN IT WILL GO THROUGH WHAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR IT HOW DID THEY END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE SAYING LOOK HEE WE WANT IT TO GO UP TO AND HE IS WORTH FOURTEEN MILLION WELL I SUPPOSE IF YOU WERE TO HAVE ANY SYMPATHY IT IS BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PAY ARRANGEMENTS IF YOU REMEMBER B.P. HAD TERRIBLE PROBLEMS WITH AN OIL LEAK IN THE IN THE GOAL FOR A FEW YEARS AGO
IT CAME UNDER IMMENSE CRITICISM LENGTH SO SOME OF THE PROFITS THAT SOME OF THE PAVEMENT THE TOP DIRECTORS GET IS NOT LINKED NECESSARILY TO PROFITS IT'S TO SAFETY
AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES SO THOSE WERE PROBABLY BROUGHT IN BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GULF AND YET NOW THE GETTING PUNISHED FOR THEM ALSO TARGETS LIKE
COST CUTTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT WILL HAS BEEN A LOT OF COST CUTTING HOWEVER IT STILL IS PRETTY IN CONGRESS THAT YOU CAN LOSE THREE POINT SIX BILLION INCREASE THE PAY HIM TAKEN PAY OF YOUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE NOW PRESUMABLY THAT YOU BY THE TIME YOU'VE GOT TO AN A.G.M. YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH SOUNDING OUT OF YOUR BIG SHAREHOLDERS TO KNOW WHICH WAY THE VOTE SHOULD GO SO DO WE PRESUME IT WILL GET THROUGH
WELL I'VE BEEN TO QUITE A FEW OF THESE IN WHICH THERE'S THERE'S BEEN LARGE PROTESTS AND LOTS OF OUTRAGED INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS GET UP AND HAVE A GO AT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVES AND THE COMPANY ANNOUNCES THAT IT'S GOT EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE VOTE BY PROXY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WHO OWN SHARES AND BOTHERED TO TURN UP AND THEY SUPPORTED THE COMPANY SO I IMAGINE IT WILL STILL GO THROUGH BUT IT'S THE SIZE OF THE REBELLION THAT MATTERS HOW EMBARRASSING IT IS FOR B.P. JONTY THANKS VERY MUCH
TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN BRING BACK THE GIRLS THAT WILL BE THE CRY HEARD TODAY IN THE NIGERIAN CAPITAL ABUJA THE GIRLS IN QUESTION THE VICTIMS OF A MESS KIDNAPPED TWO YEARS AGO BY BOKO HURRAH A VIDEO CENTRE THE GOVERNMENT BY THE ISLAMIC GROUP SUGGEST THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THEM MAY STILL BE ALIVE JOHN ON THE LINE NOW BY UM CAMMIE FOR JEEK
IT'S FASCINATING THIS VIDEO DOES IT DOES IT REALLY GIVE HOPE WHERE THERE WAS NONE BEFORE
AT THIS POINT IN TIME THEY OCCUR GOOD MORNING ANYONE ANY PARENTS WHO HAS NOT SEEN GIRLS IN TWO YEARS WILL LATCH ON TO ANYTHING FOR HOPE IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL VERY HOPEFUL THAT THEY WILL FIND THEIR CHILDREN IT'S JUST THE WAY THAT PEOPLE FEEL HERE THEY'RE VERY VERY OPTIMISTIC AND BE ALWAYS FEEL AND THEY HAVE A STRONG BELIEF IN GOD THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE RESCUED SO IT DOES OFFER A GLIMMER OF HOPE BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THAT CHILDREN HERE
I DON'T KNOW I STATE IT IS WORTH POINTING OUT THAT IT'S A SMALL IT'S A SMALL CITY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE INSURGENCY MANY PEOPLE FLED HERE
POPULATION OF THE CITY MORE THAN DOUBLED BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE COMING HERE TO SEEK REFUGE IN TO SEEK SOLACE NORTH EAST NIGERIA AFTER SYRIA HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF DISPLACED PEOPLE TWO AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DISPLACED BY THE FIGHTING SO THEY COME HERE FOR REFUGE AND I GOT A CHANCE TO VISIT ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE THEY STAYED HERE MANY CAMPS FOR INTERNALLY DISPLACED I WENT TO ONE RUN BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THE SAME TERESA'S CATHOLIC CHURCH
I MET A GIRL FIFTEEN YEARS OLD WHO HAD BEEN HELD CAPTIVE BY BOOK AROUND FOR FOUR MONTHS AND SHE TOLD ME WHAT THAT WAS LIKE A QUESTION SORRY GEORGIE BOOKER RAMA BACK MY VILLAGE WHEN I WAS IN MY HOUSE I HEARD GUNSHOTS THERE WERE KILLING SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS
AND I WAS ON MY WAY TO FLEE FROM THERE WHEN THEY GRABBED ME THEY'RE BOOKED ME FOR FOUR MONTHS BEFORE I MANAGED TO ESCAPE THEY KEPT US IN THE HOUSE AND THEY BEAT US MADE US BREAK AND READ THE COURSE
SOMETIMES THEY WOULD GIVE US A KNIFE TO BEHEAD THE CAPTIVES BUT WE COULDN'T DO IT WE JUST CRIED SO THE TREAD AND US IF WE CRIED AGAIN THERE WAS MARY HERSELF OR KILLER
SO PAINFUL OF COURSE FOR THE PARENTS OF THOSE STILL MISSING TO LISTEN TO NOW THEY COULD BE ON THE STREETS TODAY IN ABUJA IS THE IMPLICATION OR ARE THEY INDEED BEING EXPLICIT THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT SIMPLY ISN'T DOING ENOUGH TO SECURE THE RETURN OF THEIR DAUGHTERS
OF MEMBERS OF THE BRING BACK I'LL GO CAMPAIGN HAVE A MEETING MORE OR LESS EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE THE CAMPAIGN BEGAN IN LATE APRIL EARLY MAY TWENTY FOURTEEN IT'S WHAT THEY DO AND EVERY YEAR ON THE ANNIVERSARY THREE MARKETS THEY WANT THE NIGER AND GOVERNMENTS TO DO MORE BUT WHAT PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU AS WELL AS THAT
OUR TWO YEARS ON IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO VERIFY THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE GOLD THERE'VE BEEN RUMOURS ABOUT THE GIRLS HAVEN'T BEEN MARRIED OFF THERE ALSO RUMOURS PROBABLY MORE DISTRESSING ABOUT THE GIRLS TAKING PART IN SUICIDE BOMB ATTACKS NOT NECESSARILY WILLINGLY BUT THAT IS THE REALITY OF THE WAY PEOPLE FEEL SO AND THERE'S YOUR WAS HERE IN THESE SITUATIONS THE FIRST FORTY EIGHT HOURS ARE CRITICAL AFTER A KIDNAPPING AND THE FIRST FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND NOTHING WAS DONE TWO YEARS ON NO ONE QUITE KNOWS WHETHER THOSE GIRLS WILL BE
I'M GAME IF YOU CAN THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FROM NIGER IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS WITH THE HEADLINE B.B. SEE SMEARED CABINET MINISTER THE TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH AN ACCUSATION FROM WHAT IT CALLS TOP TORIES THAT THE B.B.C.'S DECISION TO REPORT JOHN WAITING DALE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH A PROSTITUTE WAS MOTIVATED BY DISCUSSIONS OVER THE LICENCE FEE
THE PAPER AGREES THE CORPORATION HAS THE MOST TO GAIN FROM SEEING MY WAITING DEL DISCREDITED THE B. B. C. DENIES IT WAS MOTIVATED BY THE LICENCE FEE THE GUARDIAN SAYS MY WITTY DEL SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DRAGGED INTO THE SPOTLIGHT BUT IF THE EPISODE FORCES HIM TO FEAR THEIR SUSPICIONS AND FOR RORY THAT WOULD NOW FOLLOW IF WE LAUNCH AND ONSLAUGHT ON THE B.B.C. THAT IS AGAIN THE SUN SAYS THE CULTURE SECRETARY IS TOLD FRIENDS THAT LEFT WING LABOUR M.P.S IMPRESS CAMPAIGNERS FROM HACKED OFF
PLOTTED TO EXPOSE THEIR RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE HE'S REFUSED TO AN ACTOR FRESH CLAMPDOWN ON NEWSPAPERS IT'S MONK SEVERAL TO PICTURE THE WOMAN KNOWN AS MISTRESS KATE IN A BONDAGE OUTFIT AND EVEN QUOTES AN ONLINE REVIEW FROM A SATISFIED CUSTOMER LABOUR LASHES OUT AT WHITTINGDON ELLE IS THE HEADLINE FOR THE TIMES WHICH DISMISSES CLAIMS THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP STOP THE CULTURE SECRETARY IMPOSING TOUGHER PRESS REGULATIONS
VOTERS TURNED AWAY FROM YOU AS TRUSTING KAMEN SLIDES IS THE HEADLINE FOR THE TIMES WITH A NEW YOUGOV POLL SUGGEST IN THE TWO SIDES ARE NECK AND NECK ON THIRTY NINE PER CENT IT SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER'S HOPES OF KEEPING BRITAIN IN THE E.U. APPEAR TO REST WITH JEREMY CORBIN WITH THE LABOUR LEADER NOW MORE TRUSTED ON THE ISSUE ACCORDING TO THE MIRROR MY ROBIN'S FIRST BIG SPEECH OF THE CAMPAIGN IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT AS IT SAYS LABOUR VOTERS WILL DETERMINE BRITAIN'S FUTURE WHILE TORIES FIGHT A CIVIL WAR
BUT THE ART NEWSPAPER BELIEVES THE TONE OF THE SPEECH WILL DO LITTLE TO ASSUAGE PRO EUROPEANS IN HIS PARTY WHO ARGUE HE'S FAILED TO THROW THE FULL WEIGHT OF HIS LEADERSHIP BEHIND THE CAUSE THE DAILY EXPRESS SAYS THERE'S ANGER AT THE REVELATION THAT RESETTLING TWENTY THOUSAND SYRIAN REFUGEES IN THE U.K. WILL COST FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION POUNDS BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT SAYS CRITICS HAVE DESCRIBED THEIR BILL OF NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND AHEAD AS RIDICULOUS AND BEMOANING THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW IT'LL BE SPENT
A NEW DAY POINT OUT THAT THE FIRST YEAR WILL BE FUNDED FROM THE FOREIGN AID BUDGET AND A FURTHER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO LOCAL COUNCILS BUT THE PAPER SAYS IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER REST WILL COME FROM FOR THE TIMES THE SCALE OF TORY UNEASE AT FORCING ALL SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND TO BE ACADEMIES BECAME CLEAR WHEN THE PARTY'S M.P.S LINED UP TWO IN ITS WORDS SAVAGE THE PLANS IN THE COMMONS YESTERDAY
IT SAYS THE EDUCATION SECRETARY HAS LITTLE OVER HIM AS LITTLE OVER A MONTH TO CONTAIN THE REVOLT BEFORE THE QUEEN'S SPEECH AND SOURCES SAY THAT MINISTER IS DETERMINED TO MEET THE CONCERNS INCLUDING HINTING AT MOVED TO BEEF UP PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT AND FINALLY FOR ANYONE STUCK IN THE DOGHOUSE THE MAIL OFF AS A GUIDE TO THE PERFECT APOLOGY IT WARNS THAT THE FORMULA DRAWN UP BY RESEARCHERS IN THE U.S. IS RATHER LONG WINDED WOULD SIX STAGES INCLUDING REGRET
REPENTANCE AND REQUIRE SWALLOWING YOUR PRIDE THOSE WHO WANT TO GET IT DONE QUICKLY IT'S A SHOULD STICK TO THEIR TWO MOST EFFECTIVE POINTS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY AND MAKING AMENDS I'M SORRY SIR WHATEVER I'VE DONE
SO WHATEVER I'VE DONE I THINK YOU WENT WRONG IT'S QUARTER TO SEVEN OUR MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT JEREMY CORBIN AND ITS FIRST SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WILL SAY TODAY THAT LABOUR IS OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN NOW THE FIRST PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTION TIME THREE WEEKS JEREMY CORBIN AND DAVID CAMERON ARGUED OVERTAX WHILST A CONSERVATIVE ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER ARE PUTTING OUT A PROPAGANDA SHEET ON THE E. U. R. PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN WHOM HAS THIS REPORT
FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF A PLAYWRIGHT HAD JEREMY CORBIN STARTED PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS WAS A CALL TO SOME OF HIS OWN CORE SUPPORTERS ANGRY YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN EVERYWHERE
THE WHOLE HOUSE WILL JOIN ME IN MOURNING THE DEATH TODAY OF THE DRAMATIST ARNOLD WESKER ONE OF THE GREAT PLAYWRIGHTS OF THIS COUNTRY ONE OF THOSE WONDERFUL ANGRY YOUNG MEN OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND LIKE SO MANY ANGRY YOUNG PEOPLE ACTUALLY CHANGE THE FACE OF OUR COUNTRY
BUT THE BACKDROP FOR THE COMMONS DRAMA WAS NOT THE COUNCIL HOUSE KITCHEN SINK BUT THE GOLDEN BEACHES OF SUNNY LAMBS WITH VIBRANT FINANCIAL SECTORS JEREMY CORBIN RECKONED THE PANAMA PIPERS MISTER SPEAKER EXPOSED TO SCAN FOR SITUATION WHERE WEALTHY INDIVIDUAL SEEM TO BELIEVE THE CORPORATION TAX AND OTHER TAXES OR SOMETHING
CERTAINLY HE RECKONED THE TAX COLLECTORS AT H.M.R.C. WERE MISSING OUT ON TAX REVENUES TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT THIRTY FOUR BILLION POUNDS
IS HE CUTTING H.M.R.C. STAFF BY TWENTY PERCENT AND CUTTING DOWN
ALFIE SAYS WHICH LOSES THE EXPERTISE OF PEOPLE TO CLOSE THAT TAGS
WELL DAVID CAMERON'S FELT THE HEAT OVER HIS OWN TAX AFFAIRS SO HE DECIDED TO HAVE SOME FUN WITH JEREMY CORBIN WHOSE TAX RECORD REVEALED A FINE FORGETTING HIS RETURN IN A BIT LATE I'M GLAD HE WANTS TO GET ON TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO PAY OUR TAXES I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THOUGHT
HIS TAX RETURN WAS A. METAPHOR FOR LABOUR POLICY IT WAS LATE IT WAS CHAOTIC IT WAS INACCURATE IT WAS ON COSTED
JEREMY CORBIN REPLIED WITH A SIDESWIPE AT THE CHANCELLOR WHOSE FAMILY BUSINESS PAID NO CORPORATION TAX FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HE SHRUGGED OFF THE JOKE ABOUT HIS TAX RECORD THERE WARTS AND ALL THE WARTS BEING MY HAND WRITING ALL BEING MY GENEROUS DONATION I ACTUALLY PAID MORE TAX THAN SOME COMPANIES OWNED BY PEOPLE THAT HE MIGHT KNOW QUITE WELL
TURNED MY POSSIBLY THE BIGGEST CHEER HE'S EVER HEARD FROM LABOUR M.P.S AS FOR THE ACCUSATION OF CUTS TO H. M. I SEE DAVID CAMERON DENIED IT I'M AFRAID IS HIS FIGURES RATHER LIKE HIS TAX RETURN HIS FIGURES AREN'T ENTIRELY ACCURATE
AT THE SUMMER BUDGET TWENTY FIFTEEN WE GAVE AN EXTRA EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS TO H.M.R.C. TO FUND ADDITIONAL WORK TO TACKLE TAX EVASION OR NON COMPLIANCE BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS IS GOING TO ENABLE H. MARCY TO RECOVER A CURATIVE SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION INTACT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
BUT THE S.N.P. WESTMINSTER LEADER ANGUS ROBERTSON WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN STAFFING AT THE TAX OFFICE HE SAID THERE WERE AROUND THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE LOOKING INTO TAX EVASION COMPARED WITH MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND STAFF INVESTIGATING BENEFITS FRAUD
WHY HAS THIS GOVERNMENT HAD TEN TIMES MORE STAFF DEALING OFTEN WITH THE POOREST IN SOCIETY USING FERRET FANCIER THAN WITH A SUPER RICH EVADING
I WILL LOOK CAREFULLY AT HIS STATISTICS BUT THEY SOUND TO ME
BOGUS MISTER CAMERON SAID ALL TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORKED FOR H.M.R.C. WERE ABOUT MAKING SURE PEOPLE PAID THEIR TAXES NOW DESPITE ALL THE EXCITEMENT ABOUT DESERT ISLAND DOLLARS POLITICIANS HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE LOOMING E.U. REFERENDUM THE GOVERNMENT'S BROCHURE IN FAVOUR OF THE U.K. STAYING IN HAS STARTED POPPING THROUGH ENGLISH LETTER BOXES TO THE IRRITATION OF LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SUCH AS THE CONSERVATIVE JACOB REES MOGG
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ECONOMIC MIGRANTS CAME FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE PERIOD FOR WHICH WE'VE GOT FIGURES AND YET THE PROPAGANDA SHEEP SENT OUT THE BRITISH PEOPLE CLAIMS WE MAINTAIN CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS HAVE WE WITHDRAWN FROM THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE OR IS THAT SHEET SIMPLY UNTRUE
DAVID CAMERON REPLIED THAT ECONOMIC MIGRANTS FROM TURKEY OR PAKISTAN WHO ARRIVED IN THE YOU DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO COME TO THE U.K. BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT E.U. NATIONALS FRANKLY THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT WE DO SEND INFORMATION'S TO HOUSEHOLDS SO THEY CAN SEE THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED WHAT MY RIGHT ON THE VENDOR'S JUST PUT FORWARD HIS CLASSIC OF THE SORT OF SCARE STORY WE GUESS
BRITAIN WILL KEEP ITS BORDERS WE'VE GOT THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
JACOB REES MOGG SMILED BUT POSSIBLY WASN'T AMUSED PERHAPS LIKE A LOT OF THE PUBLIC THE UKIP M.P. DOUGLAS CARS WHAT WAS SIMPLY LOOKING AHEAD TO THE REFERENDUM BEING OVER
IF THE BRITISH PEOPLE VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL THE PRIME MINISTER REMAIN IN OFFICE TO IMPLEMENT THEIR DECISION
IT'S GOING BY THE CHEER SEEMED TO BE SOMETHING CONSERVATIVES COULD UNITE ON SUSAN HUMOUR REPORTING AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE AS USUAL AT HALF PAST EIGHT ARE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT ON LONG WAVE AND DIGITAL IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO SEVEN
IMAGINE FINDING YOURSELF BEING DESCRIBED ONLINE AS A DRUG DEALER OR A PAEDOPHILE OR FIND IN THE FAKE FACEBOOK ACCOUNT WITH YOUR NAME AND PHOTOGRAPH IS BEING USED TO SEND EXPLICIT MESSAGES TO CHILDREN DO THE POLICE HAVE THE POWERS THE CAPACITY TO PROTECT YOU WILL HEAR LATER IN THE PROGRAMME FROM SOMEONE WHO LIVED THROUGH PRECISELY THAT EXPERIENCE LET'S HEAR FIRST OF ALL THOUGH FROM THE CHIEF CONSTABLE OF THE ESSEX POLICE STEPHEN CAVERN
HE'S HERE BECAUSE HE'S WHAT THEY CALL THE NATIONAL POLICING THE LEAD FOR DIGITAL INVESTIGATION INTELLIGENCE I THINK CAN WE TRANSLATE THAT MEANS YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF ALL THIS STUFF AS FAR AS POLICE WHAT DOES O.K. MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING LET'S TALK FIRST OF ALL ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NOW IF YOU WENT TO THE POLICE WHAT POWERS IN THEORY DO THEY HAVE WHAT CAPACITY
WELL CURRENTLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS AN EXPLOSION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRIME THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE DESSLER ENVIRONMENT WHETHER THAT STROLLING WITH A VET'S RACIAL HOMOPHOBIC ABUSE SEXTING REVENGE PORNOGRAPHY A WHOLE RANGE OF OFFENCES THAT WHEN I JOINED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE YOU WON'T EVEN MEET BEING IMAGINED OF WHAT HAPPENS IS WHAT CONCERNS ME VICTIMS THINK THEY'VE BEEN VICTIM TO A CRIME THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO ARTICULATE WHAT HAPPENED
THEY WERE EITHER CALL THE POLICE THEY MAY GO ONLINE THERE SOME VERY POSITIVE ONLINE SUPPORT BUT THEY TURN UP AT A POLICE FRONT COUNTER OR OR RING IN AND BECAUSE OF THE VARIETY OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF HOW QUICKLY THINGS ARE MOVING QUITE FRANKLY THEY GETTING AGAIN INCONSISTENT RESPONSE AND THAT UNDERMINES THEIR CONFIDENCE WHEN SOME OF THESE EVENTS HAPPEN TO BE CLEAR THERE ARE LAWS
AND THE POLICE DO GET SOME TRADING SO YOUR ARGUMENT IS IS MORE THAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO MORE OF THAT RATHER THAN THERE IS NO LEGAL FRAMEWORK NO POWERS TO ACT ABSOLUTELY AND I REPRESENT POLICE CHIEFS AND I DON'T THINK HE'S ONE OF THE THE FORCES ACROSS THE U.K. THERE THINK WE'VE GOT THIS RIGHT AT THE MOMENT THERE'S A REAL COMMITMENT FOR US TO SAY HOW DO WE GET THE OFFICES WITH THEIR SKILLS THEIR CAPABILITIES AND THE TOOLS TO MAKE SURE VICTIMS COMING FORWARD TO GETTING A BETTER SERVICE
THE TROUBLE IS IF YOU'RE A VICTIM DO YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU ARTICULATE TO THE PLACE WHAT'S CONCERNING YOU AND WE HAVE THIRTY IN THE REGION OF THIRTY PIECES OF LEGISLATION SOME OF THEM GOING BACK TO THE OFFENCES AGAINST THE PERSONS ACT EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THE COMPUTER MISUSE ACT HE'S NOW TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD THEY'RE JUST NOT REALLY HELPING INVESTIGATORS ARE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE OR VICTIMS
BRING THESE PEOPLE TO JUSTICE AND DO YOU NOT FEAR THAT IF YOU TWO ACTUALLY CLARIFY THE LAW IN THE WAY THAT YOU WANT THE POLICE MIGHT BE SWAMPED BY PEOPLE WHO SAY CRUDELY SO AND SO'S BEEN FOUL ABOUT ME AND OF COURSE THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING FOUND AND BEING LABELLED A PAEDOPHILE BUT IS IT EASY EASY EASY FOR THE POLICE AND THE LAW TO DRAW THAT DISTINCTION
IT'S IT'S NOT I MEAN WHAT POLICE MUST NEVER BECOME IN THE DIGITAL AGE IS IS THE DETERMINANTS OF GOOD TASTE WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IS IS RECOGNISED AND SUPPORT PEOPLE IN USER COMMUNITIES BUT THEY CAN HAVE INAPPROPRIATE CONVERSATIONS THAT THEY COULD SAY THINGS THEY MIGHT NOT NECESSARY SAY ELSEWHERE
BUT THERE IS A THRESHOLD THE C.P.S. ARE WORKING WITH THE POLICE TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THRESHOLD EXISTS BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S A HIGH THRESHOLD AT THE MOMENT ABOUT THE LEVEL OF FEAR THE LEVEL OF HARM THAT'S BEING CONDUCTED AND I THINK THAT CAUSES CONCERN FOR SOME VICTIMS GROUPS BUT BRINGING THE LAW TOGETHER COULD HELP I THINK ABSOLUTELY THAT'S WHAT VICTIMS WANT I THINK THAT'S WHAT MY OFFICES AND OFFICES AND OTHER FORCES WANT LET'S GIVE IT A BETTER MORE CONSISTENT SERVICE TO VICTIMS OF CRIME THE DIGITAL AGE CHIEF CONSTABLE AND I THINK OF JOINER
THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IF YOU WANT TO KEEP WEIGHT OFF FOR GOOD THEN YOU NEED TO DIET FOR A YEAR THAT'S HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR THE BODY'S CHEMICALS TO CHANGE PERMANENTLY SO THAT YOU DON'T JUST RETURN TO YOUR PRE DIET WAIT THERE FINALLY COMES WHEN NEW RESEARCH CARRIED OUT BY
THE UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN AND THE SCIENTIST BEHIND IT PROFESSOR SEEN SORENSON TORRE COUGH IS HERE WITH ME IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THE BODY WHAT WE DO KNOW WHAT THAT IS THE CASE IS THAT THE BODY HAS EVOLVED A SORT OF RESISTANCE TO LOSING WEIGHT WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO DIFFICULT EXACTLY SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LOSE US A LOT OF WEIGHT THEN ACUTELY YOU'LL HAVE A HUGE INCREASE IN HUNGER HORMONE CALLED GRRR ELLEN
BUT EXLEY AT THE SAME TIME YOU ALSO SEE AN INCREASE IN AN APPETITE INHIBITION HOME ON G.O.P. ONE AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT IF YOU ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A TWELVE KILO DIED INDUCED DO STRAIGHT GLASS FOR ONE YEAR
THEN THEIR HUNGER HORMONE EXLEY DECREASES AGAIN WHEREAS THE INCREASED LEVELS OF DEBT EVER TIED INHIBITION HORMONE DO YOU'LL BE ONE IS SUSTAINED SO IT SEEMS THAT THE BODY IS REACHING A NEW SET POINT WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY PROBABLY HELP YOU SUSTAINED THIS NEW WEIGHT OH K. A YEAR IS GOING TO SOUND LIKE AN AWFULLY LONG TIME TO ANYBODY WHO'S STRUGGLING TO LOSE WEIGHT YES SO
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHAT NECESSARY ACTUALLY IN ORDER TO REALLY HAD TO HAD TO PROCESS THIS WAIT BECAUSE LOTS OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MANY THINGS WERE HAPPENING ACUTELY DURING THIS
ANY AJIT RESTRICTED STATES BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE TO WAIT FOR A LONG TIME TOO IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE MORE TO STINK AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON OUR BODIES WE HAVE EVOLVED THAT WAY BECAUSE IF YOU WERE IN RUBBED PITS TIME OF FOOD SCARCITY IT WAS IT SUITED YOUR BODY TO BE ABLE TO STORE FAT AND TOOK TO WANT TO EAT EXACTLY IT'S A PERFECTLY NATURAL METHODS TO PRESERVE LIFE I MEAN IF WE DON'T EAT WE DIE SO THAT'S WHY THIS HUNGER SENSATION IS SO STRONG
BUT IF YOU CAN LAST A YEAR ON A REDUCED DIET THEN YOUR BODY WILL ACCOMMODATE TO THAT NEW NORM IT SEEMS IN THEIR APPETITE COME ON STEP WE MET DID SEEM STEADY EXLEY ADEPT TO DIS NEWMAN NEW NON SO THAT'S
GOOD NEWS FOR PEOPLE THAT EXLEY KEEP THE KEEP THE WEIGHT AGAIN WE'RE ALSO I SUPPOSE PROBABLY EVOLVED TO LOOK FOR SHORT CUT SHORT CUT I'M OR MEDIATE BE THINKING ABOUT IS IS THERE A WAY WITH THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE TO THINK OF SOME PILL THAT COULD BE DEVISED TO SUPPRESS YOUR DIET FOR THAT YEAR EXLEY THE G.O.P. ONE IS ACTUALLY PRODUCED IN ARTIFICIAL FORMS FROM MANY COMPANIES INDIA FROM ARTHUR G.O.P. WANT RECEPTOR ANALOGUES
SO PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING OVERWEIGHT SHOULD CONSIDER TAKING THAT THAT THAT THEY SHOULD DISCUSS WITH THEIR DOCTOR ABOUT BUT I MEAN THE MECHANISM IS THERE THAT'S THE LOGIC OF FOUNT OF COURSE O.K. SO IT IS A SIGNIFICANT FINDING IN TERMS OF WAYS TO TACKLE OBESITY IT SHOULD BE IT'S I MEAN IT'S ALWAYS THERE
THE MOST STUDIES SHOW THAT WHEN YOU LOSE A LOT OF WEIGHT THEN YOU UP YOUR BODY FIGHT FIERCELY AGAINST IT BUT WE ACTUALLY FOUND THAT WEE IF YOU'RE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR WEIGHT DOWN FOR THIS LONGER PERIOD THEN IT SEEMS TO HAVE THAT IN THIS NEW SET POINT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE YOU MAKE NEW YOU COULD BE DIET FREE
WE WE DON'T KNOW I MEAN BASICALLY REALLY TESTS THEIR MAYOR AFTER YEAR SO WE SHOULD HAVE TESTED AND THEN ALSO AFTER JULIUS BUT WE HOPE SO

HIS BASIC PAY IS GOING TO INCREASE ONLY SLIGHTLY TO ONE POINT THREE MILLION POUNDS BUT A COMPLEX SERIES OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES ON SAFETY PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COST CUTTING MEAN HE'LL MAKE FAR MORE THAN THAT SEVERAL LARGE INVESTORS IN B.P. HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT MY DUDLEY'S PAY DEAL AND EXPECTED TO VOTE AGAINST IT AT TODAY'S A.G.M. THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS URGE SHAREHOLDERS TO SCRUTINISE THE PAY DEAL ARGUING THAT IF ENDORSED IT COULD SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE TO OTHER COMPANIES
IT SAID MY DUDLEY'S FOURTEEN MILLION POUND PAY PACKAGE WOULD SEEM UNJUSTIFIED TO MANY SHAREHOLDERS CONSIDERING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS TODAY'S VOTE IS ONLY ADVISORY AND THEREFORE VERY UNLIKELY TO STOP THIS PAY AWARD
THE PARENTS OF A LARGE GROUP OF NIGERIAN SCHOOLGIRLS SEIZED BY BOKO HARAM MILITANTS TWO YEARS AGO TODAY ARE HOLDING A PROTEST MARCH IN THE CAPITAL ABUJA DESPITE A BIG MILITARY SEARCH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN GIRLS ABDUCTED IN THE NORTH EASTERN TOWN OF CHI BOK ARE STILL MISSING HER ARM HAS SENT A VIDEO TO THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH APPEARS TO SHOW SOME OF THE GIRLS WEARING BLACK ROBES ON CHRISTMAS DAY MARTIN PATIENCE REPORTS FROM A BRIDGE

THE MASS ABDUCTION TWO YEARS AGO BY BOOK OR RAM MILITANTS SPARKED WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION BUT DESPITE INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THE GIRLS HAS BEEN RESCUED
THEIR PARENTS ARE FURIOUS BLAMING THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT FOR DOING NOTHING WHEN THE KIDNAPPING TOOK PLACE AND NOW THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION FOR FAILING TO DEPORT ENOUGH RESOURCES TO THIS
HEALTH OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES SO THAT THE ZEKE A VIRUS DEFINITELY CAUSES BABIES TO BE BORN WITH UNUSUALLY SMALL HEADS AND SEVERE BRAIN ABNORMALITIES THE CONFIRMATION ENDS MONTHS OF DEBATE ABOUT THE CAUSE OF A RISE IN BIRTH DEFECT DEFECT AND BRAZIL TOUCH HER SONIA RASMUSSEN FROM THE U. S. CENTRES FOR DISEASE CONTROL SAYS ATTENTION CAN NOW BE GIVEN TO THE NEXT STEP IN THEIR RESEARCH
I THINK IT REALLY HELPS THAT WE CAN BE MORE CLEAR AND OUR MESSAGING AND WE CAN REALLY FOCUS HER RESEARCH INTO THAT IMPORTANT REMAINING QUESTIONS WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF RISK ARE THERE OTHER DEFECTS ARE THERE OTHER LEARNING PROBLEMS THAT WILL SEE WITH KIDS LATER ON IN LIFE AND THEN WHATEVER OTHER FACTORS THAT INCREASE OR DECREASE THE RISK OF A BABY HAVING PROBLEMS RELATED TO ZEKE
THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY HAS SET OUT NEW RULES TO MAKE AIR SHOW SAFER AS PART OF A MAJOR REVIEW TRIGGERED BY THE SHORE AND CRASH LAST AUGUST SIX MILLION PEOPLE ATTEND THEIR SHOWS IN THE U.K. EVERY YEAR AND THE C.A.A. SAYS SAFETY MUST BE IT'S TOP PRIORITY HE STEAL LEGGETT
THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY BEGAN A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF SAFETY AT AIR SHOWS AFTER THE SHOREHAM CRASH LAST YEAR ELEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE ACCIDENT WHEN A VINTAGE HAWKER HUNTER JET CRASHED ONTO A BUSY ROAD THE NEW RULES INCLUDED IN THIS FINAL REPORT WILL INCREASE THE MINIMUM ALTITUDE AT WHICH EX MILITARY JETS CAN CARRY OUT MANOEUVRES RAISED THE MINIMUM DISTANCE BETWEEN THE CROWD AND THE AIRCRAFT AT CIVIL DISPLAYS TO MATCH THOSE MILITARY SHOWS AND REQUIRE PILOTS OF EX MILITARY JETS TO BE MORE HIGHLY QUALIFIED
EARLIER THIS YEAR THE AUTHORITY TIGHTENED UP REGULATIONS COVERING RISK ASSESSMENTS AND TRAINING FOR SHOW DIRECTORS AS WELL AS CHECKS ON THE EXPERIENCE AND HEALTH OF PILOTS IT'S ALSO INCREASE THE FEES PAID BY SHOW ORGANISERS TO FUND THEIR NEW MEASURES SOME DISPLAYS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED AS A RESULT
AN INDEPENDENT REPORT HAS DELIVERED A SCATHING VERDICT ON THE POLICE AND CHICAGO AMERICA'S THIRD LARGEST CITY HE FOUNDED OFFICERS HAD ALIENATED THE BLACK AND HISPANIC COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES BY USING EXCESSIVE FORCE AND HONOURING A CODE OF SILENCE FROM WASHINGTON A BICKER THE DAMNING REPORT CLAIMS THAT POLICE IN CHICAGO HAVE NO REGARD FOR THE SANCTITY OF LIFE WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE OF COLOUR IT ASKS FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED SWEEPING CHANGES TO THE POLICE FORCE
THE PANEL CONCLUDED THAT THE FEAR AND LACK OF TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AMONG MINORITIES IS JUSTIFIED THEY FOUND THAT SEVENTY FOUR PER CENT OF THE HUNDREDS SHOT BY OFFICERS IN RECENT YEARS WERE AFRICAN AMERICANS EVEN OR BLACKS OR KENT FOR A THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THE CITY'S POPULATION THE NEW POLICE CHIEF EDDIE JOHNSON IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WITH TWENTY SEVEN YEARS' EXPERIENCE HE'D THOUGH TO ROOT OUT RACISM WITHIN THE FORCE
THE INDEPENDENT CHIEF INSPECTOR OF BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION HAS CRITICISED THE USE OF SEARCH DOGS AT MANCHESTER AIRPORT HE SAID IN THE SEVEN MONTHS TO JUNE LAST YEAR THE DOGS FEEL TO DETECT ANY CLASS A. DRUGS ARE THERE ONE OF THEM HAD PROVED ADEPT AT SNIFFING OUT CHEESE AND SAUSAGES
A SURVEY FOR THE B. B. C. SUGGEST THAT ALMOST HALF THE PEOPLE DRIVING THE VINYL REVIVAL NEVER LISTEN TO THE RECORDS THEY BUY SALES AND VINYL HAVE SEARCHED BY MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OVER THE PAST YEAR REACHING LEVELS NOT SEEN SINCE THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT AS MARK SAVAGE REPORTS MANY BUYERS SIMPLY WANT A PHYSICAL COPY OF THE ALBUMS THEY STREAM ON LINE THANK ON
ADELE'S TWENTY FIVE WAS THE BIGGEST SELLING ALBUM ON THE FINAL LAST YEAR BUT NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THE RECORD NEVER TOOK IT OUT OF ITS SLEEVE IN FACT SEVEN PER CENT OF PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT VINYL IN THE PAST MONTH DO NOT EVEN OWN A RECORD PLAYER AMONG THEM HIS TEENAGE STUDENT
JORDAN COULD TEN DAY MAROON BUT IT'S MORE AS A SENSIBLE LIKE THAT GIVE ME THAT OLD SCHOOL FIVE OR NO THAT'S FINE AS WELL
I DON'T ACTUALLY PLAY THOUGH TODAY'S SURVEY BY I.C.M. UNLIMITED ALSO SUGGESTS THAT FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO PART OF VINYL ALBUM LAST YEAR FIRST TRIED IT OUT ON A STREAMING SERVICE THE COMPANY SAYS YOUNGER FANS IN PARTICULAR ARE INCREASINGLY KEEN TO OWN A SOUVENIR OF THEIR FAVOURITE RECORD
MARK SAVAGE REPORTING ADELE SINGING OF COURSE IT IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IF YOUR COMPANY HAD MADE A RECORD LOSS IF YOU WERE CUTTING THOUSANDS OF JOBS IF YOU WERE FREEZING THE PAVE YOUR STAFF HE MIGHT THINK THAT IT WAS AT BEST WELL
A TAD INSENSITIVE TO TAKE A PAY INCREASE OF TWENTY PERCENT THAT THERE WAS WHAT B.P.'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE BOB BOB DUDLEY IS DOING AND IF YOU INCLUDE HIS PAY HIS BONUS SHARES AND PENSIONS CONTRIBUTIONS MY DUDLEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE IT THIS YEAR ON
JUST AROUND FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS AT THE COMPANY'S A.G.M. A NUMBER OF LARGE INVESTORS WILL WE ARE TOLD VOTE AGAINST THE PAY RISE THE PAY PACKAGE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS UNJUSTIFIED CONSIDERING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY NOT THE VERDICT OF SOME TRADE UNION BUT OF THE BUSINESS CHEERLEADERS AT THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS
BEGS ONE VERY SIMPLE QUESTION WHY ON EARTH IS IT HAPPENING B.P. YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO KNOW I'M NOT TAKING UP OUR INVITATION TO COME ON AND EXPLAIN BUT PERHAPS STEFFAN STERN DIRECTOR OF THE HIGH PAY CENTRE CAN HE JOINS US IN THE STUDIO
LET'S BE CLEAR STEFFAN STONE THIS IS NOT SOMEONE SITTING IN A ROOM SO ALL SHOULD BE FIFTEEN PERCENT SHOULD BE TWENTY PERCENT IT'S A FORMULA WHICH IS JUST PRODUCE THIS FIGURE ISN'T IT YES AND ALSO IT'S THE RESULT OF DISCUSSIONS ON SOMETHING CALLED THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE OR THE WREN CO FOR SHORT AND THE NUMBER IS CALCULATED THEN PRESENTED TO THE BIG INVESTORS THERE SOUNDED OUT PUBLICLY WHICH IS EXTREMELY UNUSUAL MANY OF THESE INVESTORS OR SAY THAT NUMBER IS FAR TOO HIGH BUT COULD THEY
ALTER THE FORMULA AND WHY MIGHT THEY BE INHIBITED FROM SAYING OH KAY WE SET A FORMULA BEURRE LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE LET'S FIDDLE WITH IT NOW
THERE HIS DISCRETION YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T A FORCE OF NATURE IT'S A BIT LIKE WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED THE MARKETS ARE SO IT'S A MACHINE THAT JUST HAPPENS IT'S HUMAN BEINGS AND THESE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR THEY'RE PAID TO USE THEIR JUDGEMENT AND THEIR DISCRETION TO SAY WHAT THE NUMBER SHOULD BE WELL THEN WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO THE RATHER SIMPLE QUESTION THIS IS CLEARLY DAFT IT'S DAFT P. R.
INSIDE THE FIRM IT'S DAPPY ARE OUTSIDE THE FIRM SO THEY WERE CLEVER PEOPLE IN COMPANIES BEYOND GREED WHICH SOME PEOPLE THINK IS THE ANSWER WHY WOULDN'T BOB DUDLEY HIMSELF OR THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THESE DECISIONS SIMPLY ALTER IT
I THINK PEOPLE CAN BE TO INTERNALLY FOCUSED I THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH PAY WHICH IS NOT SO MUCH THE AMOUNT BUT THE STATUS THE POSITION THAT YOU HAVE IN A LEAGUE TABLE EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE IN THE TOP QUARTER AND PERHAPS AS A CONSEQUENCE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF SOME OF THE TRANSPARENCY I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT WE KNOW WHAT THESE NUMBERS ARE BUT OF COURSE IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SAY WELL LOOK A FIFTH HIM HE OVER THERE HE'S GETTING THAT NUMBER I'M DEAF YOU'RE GETTING WARM HIM LIKE FOOTBALLERS WHO CARE WHETHER THEY GET EIGHTY OR SEVENTY GRAND A WEEK NOT BECAUSE THE TEN GRAND MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE TO THEM BUT IT SAYS WHERE THEY ARE IN A PECKING ORDER
INDEED BUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO SEE HIS WREN CASE CO CHAIRMAN ACTUALLY EXERCISING SOME RESTRAINT THERE'S NO NEED THERE'S NO NEED FOR THESE NUMBERS TO BE THIS HIGH YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO DO A GOOD JOB WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS ACTUALLY ACCUSATIONS ALWAYS BEEN THESE WREN COSIES REMUNERATION COMMITTEES ARE BASICALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ON HIGH SALARIES DECIDING THAT PAY OF OTHER PEOPLE AND OF COURSE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT COS THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE CLUB
THAT IS THE ACCUSATION I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO IT WHAT IS REALLY LACKING IN THAT CONVERSATION IS THE VOICE OF THE EMPLOYEE AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK THAT EMPLOYEE REPRESENTS IT SHOULD IN SOME FORM OR OTHER BE ABLE TO ASSERT THEIR POINT OF VIEW TOO THAT'S PARTLY WHY THESE NUMBERS GROW SO HIGH BECAUSE THEY ARE ALMOST LITERALLY UNREAL THEY'RE OUT OF SIGHT OF THE REST OF THE WORKFORCE WHICH WE KNOW IS VERY DAMAGING FOR MORALE AND SO ON MOTIVATION WITHIN THE BUSINESS TODAY THEY WERE ITS SHAREHOLDERS RATHER EMPLOYEES WHO GET THEIR SAY WE'RE TOLD THAT LARGE SHAREHOLDERS WILL VOTE AGAINST
THEY KNOW IT'LL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE SO IS YOUR INSTINCT THERE ANY VEGGIE AGAINST TO BE SEEN TO DO IT OR BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY THINK THEY CAN CHANGE THE PAY POLICY I THINK IT'S A BIT OF BOTH AGAIN WE USE THIS ONE WORD SHAREHOLDER TO DESCRIBE A VERY WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE IN INSTITUTIONS OF DIFFERENT TIME HORIZONS AND PREJUDICES AND SO ON I THINK THEY PROBABLY GENUINELY DO YOU THINK THIS NUMBER IS A REALLY BAD IDEA AND THAT'S WHY THE SAYINGS AND BRIEFLY IF YOU COULD WHAT IS THIS IN LINE WITH THE PATTERN THAT YOU SEE YOU OBSERVE AT THE HIGH PAY CENTRE WITH OTHER COMPANIES
YES I'M AFRAID SO WE STILL SEE A LACK OF RESTRAINT AND WE STILL SEE PEOPLE FORGETTING TO MOST THINGS OUR PARENTS TOLD US ABOUT CONTRIBUTION BEING ABOUT WHAT YOU PUT IN WHAT YOU TAKE OUT AND ALSO THAT THIS BIG GAP BETWEEN THE TOP
THE MYTH OF THE HERO C.O. SOMEHOW TURNING WHOLE BUSINESS ROUND ON HIM OR HERSELF IT'S REALLY NOT HELPED BY THIS ENORMOUS THESE INFLATED NUMBERS AT THE VERY TOP STEP IN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US
IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN JEREMY CORBIN WILL MAKE HIS FIRST MAJOR INTERVENTION IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM THIS MORNING WITH A SPEECH SAYING HIS PARTY OVERWHELMINGLY BELIEVES THE COUNTRY'S BEST INTERESTS ARE SERVED BY REMAINING IN THE E.U. WHAT'S EXPECTED TO BE A CLOSE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN LABOUR COULD PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN CONVINCING PARTS OF THE ELECTORATE THAT OTHER PARTIES CAN'T REACH BUT PERSUADING YOU'RE A SCEPTIC LABOUR VOTERS WON'T BE EASY OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS REPORTS FROM COLCHESTER
THAT'S A SHIFT MY OH IT'S A FLYING FART ABOUT IN THE SPRING SUNSHINE HERE THE MAN MAKING BALLOON ANIMALS IS DOING A ROARING TRADE AND THE KIDS ARE HAPPY TITTERING AWAY
AS FOR SOME OF THE GROWN UPS THOUGH THEY'RE MUCH GLOOMIER WE JUST GETTING SWAMPED WITH PEOPLE THESE DAYS WE HAVE ALL THESE IMMIGRANTS COME WI IT STRETCHES ALL THE RESOURCES AND REALLY OTHER COUNTRIES NOT BIG ENOUGH TO COPE FOR IT BUT IT'S NOT
THERE IS NO CULTURE ANY MORE COS IT'S THAT CONTROL THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING IN ALL THE TIME THERE'S NOT ENOUGH JOBS AND STUFF TO GO AROUND AS IT IS AND EXCEPT IN ALL THE PEOPLE INTO THIS COUNTRY AND IS PUT IN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY HERE ARE WORSE OFF
CHATTING TO THEM POLITICS PROFESSOR THOMAS SCOTT FROM JUST UP THE ROAD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX AND HIS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THEIR VIEWS COULD BE A MORE POWERFUL FORCE IN BRITISH POLITICS THE MANY HAVE ASSUMED A LARGE SEGMENT THE BRITISH PUBLIC THEY HAVE ATTITUDE IT THE AUTHORITARIAN POPULIST IN BRITAIN SCEPTICAL OF IMMIGRATION SCEPTICAL OF THE CHANGING MORE AS A SOCIETY IS SCEPTICAL OF EUROPE
THAT LARGE SEGMENT OF PEOPLE THOSE HE CALLS AUTHORITARIAN POPULISTS LABOUR VOTERS AMONG THEM MAY AMOUNT TO AS MUCH AS HALF THE ADULT POPULATION ACCORDING TO HIS STUDY REACHING FAR BEYOND THOSE SOMETIMES DESCRIBED SIMPLY AS LEFT BEHIND BY GLOBALISATION SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE SAME
ALL THESE EASTERN EUROPEANS WHAT WITH COLLEAGUES IS THAT BACK AT THE ATTITUDE REVEALED IN FOUR YEARS OF SURVEYS OF VOTERS PANELS PUT TOGETHER BY THE POLLING FIRM YOU GUFF AND HE THINKS THIS MOMENT IN TWENTY TEN MAY HAVE BEEN A DEFINING ONE WHAT DID OUR SET TO BE A BIGOTED THERE WHAT WAS WHAT
WHAT WAS BIGOTED AND THEN LABOUR PRIME MINISTER GORDON BROWN CONFRONTED ABOUT IMMIGRATION AMONG OTHER ISSUES BY VOTER GILLIAN DUFFY WHO HE LATER
FAMOUSLY DESCRIBED AS A BIGOTED WOMAN PEOPLE LIKE US ACADEMICS IN THOSE SORT OF LAND IN A LEAD TO SHRUG OFF CONCERNED ABOUT IMMIGRATION THEY SHRUG OFF CONCERNS ABOUT THE DECLINE OF BRITAIN AS A MILITARY POWER AND THIS IS WHERE I THINK SOME OF THE SOMETHING ANIMOSITY IS COMING FROM AND SOME OF THE SORT OF THE ELECTORATE ARE SAYING WE CANNOT KILL AND HE THINKS THEY WILL CERTAINLY COUNT AT THE E.U. REFERENDUM THAT THESE VIEWS ARE SET TO HAVE A HUGE EFFECT ON THE DECISIONS THAT PEOPLE MAKE
THESE CLASSIFICATION WE DIE ANY OF PEOPLE WE DEFINE AS AUTHORITARIAN POPULACE OR THOSE WHO WANT TO VOTE
DON'T THINK THAT SIMPLY SIGNS UP HALF THE POPULATION IS GUARANTEED VOTES FOR THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN ANTHONY WELLS FROM YOU GUFF THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAVE FUSED TO BE CHARACTERISED AS A FOREST ARYAN
WITHIN THAT THERE ARE DEGREES THIS ISN'T HALF THE COUNTRY A DYED IN THE WOOL UKIP AS YOU WANT TO PULL OUT A FEW EUROPE STRAIGHTAWAY WANT TO STOP IMMIGRATION
BUT CONVINCING A BLOCK OF VOTERS WHO COMBINE A DEEP SET SCEPTICISM ABOUT THE E.U. ITSELF WITH A SIMILAR SCEPTICISM ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS IN IMMIGRATION WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS INCLUDING LABOURS WHEN THE REFERENDUMS DONE CAN JEREMY CORBIN'S PARTY WOO THOSE ELECTORS AS IT HAS POINTS IN ITS PAST OR
TRY TO PERSUADE THEM TO TAKE A RATHER DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE WORLD THAT WAS ROSS HAWKINS REPORTING WE'RE TALKING TO HILARY BENN JUST BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW AND J.D. SPORTS HAS JUST POSTED
SURPRISED ME MAYBE RECORD PROFITS ROB YEUNG HAS THE LATEST IT HAS INDEED YES SIR J.D. SPORTS SAYS ITS PROFITS SOARED BY FORTY FIVE PERCENT OVER THE PAST YEAR TO ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION POUNDS THE COMPANY HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED ITS SECOND YEAR OF DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IN LIKE FOR LIKE SALES WE CAN TALK TO THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF J.D. SPORTS PETER COWGILL WHO JOINS US FROM THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE MORNING TO YOU MISTER COWGILL MOLLY YOUR RIVAL SPORTS DIRECT SEEMS TO BE HAVING A MUCH TOUGHER TIME OF IT THAN YOU SO WHY THE BIG RISE IN PROFITS
I THINK WE'VE GOT A FOCUS PROPOSITION BASED ON THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS
SPORT ATHLETICISM AND LEISUREWEAR OR COMBINE IN AS A TREND FOR THE YOUTH ARE DEVELOPING AGE MARKET
YES THIS IS CALLED ATH LEISURE ONE OF THOSE SLIGHTLY ODD WORDS THE TREND FOR WEARING SPORTSWEAR OUTSIDE THE GYM IS THERE NOT A DANGER THAT THIS IS MAYBE A FASHION FAD THAT WILL FADE NO I THINK YOU VERY EASILY EXPLAIN AN INCREASING TREND OVER THE RECENT YEARS
YOUR STAFF COSTS ARE RISING AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE AS LOTS OF COMPANIES COSTS THE RISING OF COURSE HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH THAT OBVIOUSLY WITH WE'VE HAD TO CONSIDER THAT AS A AS A MAJOR COST ASPECTS PARTICULARLY AS WE OPERATES IN THE IN THE YOUTH MARKET
A STUFFED SENSIBLY HAVE OVER SLIGHTLY YOUNGER AGE BUT BUT
EQUALLY WE SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUR CUSTOMER BASE IS IS IN THAT SIMILAR DEMOGRAPHIC AND WE SEE IT AS A TWO WAY STREET RIGHT SO YOUR CUSTOMERS HAVE POTENTIALLY HAD A PAY RISE AS WELL THEN SO DO YOU EXPECT YOUR SALES OVER THE NEXT YEAR TO CONTINUE TO RISE BY DECENT AMOUNTS PERHAPS EVEN DOUBLE IT ARE GREAT
WELL WE'VE HAD TO UP TO NOW SO IT MAY BE OPTIMISTIC TOO TO EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE BUT SO FAR SO GOOD AND WE CONTINUE TO ATTACK THE MARKET ANOTHER DISCUSSION TODAY OF THE PAY OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES BECAUSE B.P. WANTS TO GIVE THEIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE BOB DUDLEY A TWENTY PERCENT PAY RISE EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY MADE A RECORD LOSS LAST YEAR IF YOU MADE A LOSS WITH YOUR BOARD BE ITCHING TO GIVE YOU A PAY RISE
THEY'RE NOT EVEN ITCHING TO GIVE ME A PAY RISE EVEN THOUGH WE'VE MADE RECORD PROFITS BUT WHAT YOU SEE WHAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR ONE AND THEY THEY'VE NOT THE HYDRA
DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN AT THE MOMENT SOME COMPANY BOSSES HAVE PERHAPS JUST PAID A BIT TOO MUCH YEAH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY INVOLVED BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT
REMUNERATION SHOULD BE RESULTS ORIENTATED GREATREX THEM OH KAY IT'S GAGGLE FROM J.D. SPORTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DON'T THANK
ROB THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHY DID THE B.B.C. DISCLOSED THAT THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WAITING DEL HAD A SIX MONTH RELATIONSHIP WITH A SEX WORKER THAT NEWSPAPERS KNEW ABOUT BUT WE'RE NOT REPORTING THE TELEGRAPH QUOTES A CABINET MINISTERS SAYING THE B.

LADY HE MET ON A DATING WEBSITE THAT'S WHAT THAT IS SINGLE BOAT HAS AFFAIR WITH THE FUR GOES OUT WITH SINGLE GIRL THEY CAME TO THE SUNDAY PEOPLE I THINK FIRST IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND NOW IF YOU REMEMBER THAT WAS QUITE QUICKLY AFTER THE END OF THE LEVERSON INQUIRY THE LEVISON ENQUIRY WE HAD
PUT A GREAT DEAL OF OR JAW ONTO THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS AND JEALOUS AND GENERAL WITH A BIN THE FLOOD OF CRITICISM AT THE BIT WE'VE BEEN PAINTED AS THE SORT OF LIVING INCARNATION OF EVIL RATHER THAN AS I GENUINELY BELIEVED THE PRESSES AS A REAL MAJOR FORCE
SO THE STORY ARRIVES IN THE SUNDA PEOPLE'S OFFICE IT'S A STORY THAT IT WAS STORIES ARRIVE IN NEWSPAPER OFFICES THEY'RE IN A VERY ROUGH FORM THERE BUT THEY'RE LIKE TO HAVE A LOT OF HOLES IN IT TAKES TIME TO GET EVERYTHING SORTED OUT THERE HAVE BEEN LEGAL PROBLEMS MANY MANY PROBLEMS A STORY ARRIVES

THE VIDEO HAS A MARRIAGE PURPORTING TO SHOW SOME OF THE TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLGIRLS WHO WERE ABDUCTED BY BOKO HARAM MILITANTS IN NIGERIA EXACTLY TWO YEARS AGO THE PARENTS OF SOME OF THE GIRLS HAVE TO MARK THE ANNIVERSARY BY MARCHING IN A BUTCHER TO DEMAND THE GOVERNMENT DOES MORE TO FIND THEIR DAUGHTER
HEALTH OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES SO THEY FOUND EVIDENCE CONFIRMING A LINK BETWEEN THE ZEKE OF VIOLENCE AND BIRTH DEFECTS SIGNS OF THE VIRUS WHICH IS MAINLY SPREAD THROUGH MOSQUITO BITES WERE FOUND IN THE BRAIN TISSUE SPINAL FLUID AND AMNIOTIC FLUID OF AFFECTED BABIES
THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY HAS OUTLINED NEW SAFETY RULES FOR AIR DISPLAYS IN THE U.K. IT CARRIED OUT A MAJOR REVIEW AFTER ELEVEN PEOPLE DIED WHEN A JET CRASHED ONTO A ROAD DURING THE SHOREHAM IN A SHOW IN WEST SUSSEX THE AUTHORITIES CALLED FOR AN INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM ALTITUDE FROM MANOEUVRES AND IN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE CROWD AND AIRCRAFT AIRCRAFT AT CIVIL DISPLAYS
A REPORT ON THE CHICAGO POLICE FORCE COMMISSIONED BY CITY OFFICIALS HAS CONCLUDED THIS IT'S RIVEN BY RACISM AND INSTITUTIONAL FAILURES IT FOUND THAT THE BLACK AND HISPANIC COMMUNITY WERE JUSTIFIED IN THEIR LACK OF TRUST IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY'D SUFFERED DECADES OF BIAS AND EXCESS OF FORCE CHICAGO'S NEW AFRICAN AMERICAN POLICE CHIEF HAS PROMISED TO ROOT OUT RACISM
THE TIME TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT A VIDEO THAT'S BEEN SENT BY BOKO HARAM TO THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO SHOW THAT SOME OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX GIRLS KIDNAPPED FROM A SCHOOL IN CHIP UP EXACTLY TWO YEARS AGO ARE STILL ALIVE

WHO APPARENTLY SEVENTEEN OF HAVE ACTUALLY DIED SINCE THOSE CHILDREN WENT HAD ABDUCTED THEN APPARENTLY FOURTEEN OF THEM DIED FROM HEART FAILURE AND THREE TO BOOK ATTACK SO REALLY IT IS IT IS A PAINFUL THING FOR THE MAJOR IN PEOPLE IT'S A PAINFUL THING FOR THE PARENTS BUT ALSO MOTH
I THINK IT'S A LACY GIVE PEOPLE HOPE THAT THOSE CHILDREN ARE STILL THERE AND THEY MAY BE SAVED BUT NOT THAT OF COURSE IT ALSO OPENS INTERESTING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOW BE UNDER MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE PRESSURE TO ACTUALLY GO IN AND FIND THOSE CHILDREN IT'S VERY HARD FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD BE IN A SITUATION WHERE DESPITE ALL THE PROMISES AND THIS PRESIDENT WAS ELECTED ON A PROMISE TO SORT THIS OUT HOW WE CAN STILL BE IN THIS SITUATION
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT WE EXPECT THE NIGERIAN ARMY TO DO WHAT HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO DO THE NIGERIAN ARMY HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN DESIGNED FOR REGIME'S SECURITY SO SECURITY OF THE CALL IN YOUR GOVERNMENT SECURITY OF THE MILITARY DICTATORS THAT TOOK OVER AFTERWARDS
AND WHEN LEDGER MOVED TRANSIT HEADING TO DEMOCRACY THE ARMY WAS ESSENTIALLY OUTSOURCE DO WITH THE REST OF THE AFRICAN CONTINENTAL PEACEKEEPING IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM FROM MEDDLING IN POLITICS SO ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE THIS WE WERE THERE'S BOYLE HAS BEEN FESTERING IN THAT IT
IN TERMS OF BOOK WHERE I AM AND WE EXPECT THEM TO AUTOMATICALLY BE ABLE TO RESPOND THEY'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TRAINED TO DO SO AND NOW THE PIETY OF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE EQUIPMENT THE THE BOOST THE MORALE OF THE ARMY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR THE ARMY TO DO EXACTLY WHAT HE SHOULD DO WHICH IS TO UPHOLD THE SOCIAL CONTRACT AND PROTECT THE PEOPLE AND NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT WE'RE JOINED MANY BRING IN HERE FROM NIGERIA A DERBY TRISHA NOIR BARNEY WHO IS
AND ALSO AND ALSO AN ACTIVIST WHIZZY BRING BACK A GIRL'S PROTEST MOVEMENT HELLO HELLO TO YOU CAN I GET YOUR RESPONSE FIRST OF ALL TO THIS VIDEO THAT'S A MAD THAT'S BEEN SHOWN ON C.N.N.

WHILE THE GOVERNMENT HAS MANAGED OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS TO ADAMANT ACTUALLY SAIL OVER THE PAST YEAR TO RECLAIM SOME OF THE GROUND THAT THE BOOK A TERRORIST ACTUALLY CLEANED AS PART OF THEIR CALIPHATE AND ADI STU AND I THINK THE ARMY NEEDS TO BE COMMENDED FOR DOING SO UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I THINK A QUESTION WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES IS THIS WHAT IS THE
THE OBJECTIVE THAT BOOK AROUND HAD IN MIND OF ACTUALLY RELEASE HILDA'S AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME I'D BE TOAST IN THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE TOTEM OF THE NIGERIAN PEOPLE OR ARE THEY EVEN SIGNIFYING THAT THEY HAVE TO EVEN ENGAGE MORE ATROCIOUS ACTIVITIES AND I THINK THE RESPONSE THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IS NOT JUST A RESPONSE FROM THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BUT IT SHOULD BE A RESPONSE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WE'VE ALL LOOKED SCENE BUT DID THE DASTARDLY ATTACKS IN FRANCE AND IN BELGIUM
THE WORLD CAME TOGETHER IS SOLIDARITY ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO FIGHT TERRY'S IN THE WEST BUT WE SEE A SCENARIO IN AFRICA IN AFRICA'S MOST POPULOUS NATION WHERE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE ALLEGEDLY WHERE ESTIMATED TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND FIVE THAT'S MORE THAN ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE RECENT ATTACKS IN THE IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE AND LEVEL OF SUPPORT ESLER DOUGHTY DOUBLE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS NOT BEEN FORTHCOMING THE DECISION HAS TO BE MADE
IF LIVES IN AFRICA LIVES IN NIGERIA MATTER AS MUCH AS LIVES IN WESTERN COMMUNITY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE PILOT OF RESPONSIBILITY IS A RESPONSIBLY TELL I CAN'T I DON'T BE TRISHA AND WHILE BARNEY DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT THAT THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO THIS HASN'T BEEN GOOD ENOUGH AND ACTUALLY THIS SORT OF THIS PROVOCATIVE ACT ON THE PART OF BOKO HARAM SHOULD PROMPT SOME SOMETHING MORE

TWENTY TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE PAPERS NOW BATTLE FOR BRITAIN BEGINS DECLARES THE DAILY EXPRESS WHICH IS THE CRUSADE TO LEAVE THE HAS TAKEN A HUGE STEP FORWARD WITH THE RIVAL GROUPS PLEDGING TO WORK TOGETHER AFTER VOTE LEVERS DESIGNATED THE OFFICIAL OUT CAMPAIGN BUT ACCORDING TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES RIVAL BRICKS IT CAMPAIGNERS ERUPTED INTO OPEN FEUDING WITH THE MILLIONAIRE ARRAN BANKS A BACKER OF WHAT'S CALLED GRASS ROOTS OUT DESCRIBING VOTE LEAVES APPLICATION AS FULL OF LIES AND MISREPRESENTATIONS
THE TELEGRAPH CAUTIONS HIM AGAINST HIS THREATEN LEGAL CHALLENGE THE TASK FACING LEAVE SIDE SAYS THE PAPERS DIFFICULT ENOUGH WITHOUT THE ADDED DISTRACTION OF AN INTERNAL SQUABBLE WITH THE HEADLINE YOU HYPOCRITES THE DAILY MAIL SAYS THE B. B. C. LABOUR AND THE PRIVACY GROUP HACKED OFF HAD UGLY HIDDEN AGENDAS FOR SEIZING ON THE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE CULTURE SECRETARY HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH A SEX WORKER THEY'VE ALSO OFFERS ITS READERS PLENTIFUL DETAILS ABOUT
MISTRESS KATE THE DOMINATRIX FOR THE MIRROR THE MAIN STORIES THAT MY INTERFACES AN INVESTIGATION FOR TAKING HIS LOVER ON A TWO NIGHT ALL EXPENSES PAID TRIP TO AMSTERDAM IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE MINISTER FOR FUN IT SAYS HAS QUESTIONS TO ANSWER THE F.T. LEADS WITH A WARNING FROM THE OUTGOING HEAD OF THE TREASURY THE GEORGE OSBORNE WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER SELLING THE GOVERNMENT'S NINETEEN BILLION POUND STAKE IN ALL BS AT A LOSS SO NICK MACPHERSON TELLS THE PAPER THAT SELLING THE STATE REMAINING SHARES BY THE NEXT ELECTION WILL BE TRICKY
THE GUARDIAN THE MAIN STORIES WHAT IT CAUSED THE ROW OVER TORY TARGETS AFTER DAVID CAMERON WAS CONFRONTED IN THE COMMONS WITH FIGURES SHOWING THAT THOUSANDS MORE GOVERNMENT INSPECTORS ARE EMPLOYED TO TACKLE BENEFIT FRAUD AND TAX EVASION BY THE WEALTHIEST
IT NOTES THAT WHILE MY CAMERA TO THE CLAIM BY THE S.N.P. IS WESTMINSTER LEADER ANGUS ROBERTSON SOUNDED ENTIRELY BOGUS THE GOVERNMENT LATER CONFIRMED THERE WAS INDEED A GAP OF THREE THOUSAND NEW FOREIGN AID OUTRAGES THE MAIN HEADLINE FOR THE MALE WHICH SAYS AND WE SEE DE STUDY SHOWS BRITAIN NOW ACCOUNTS FOR ONE POUND IN EVERY SEVEN GIVEN BY RICH COUNTRIES ARE PAPER SAYS THAT WHEN DAVID CAMERON BECAME PRIME MINISTER THE PROPORTION WAS JUST TEN PER CENT
IT ALSO IT'S ALSO THE LEAD FOR THE SUM WITH THE HEADLINE WHAT A WASTE IT SAYS MUCH OF THE CASH BEING HAS BEEN SQUANDERED ON PROJECTS SUCH AS BREEDING FISH IN MADAGASCAR AND TEACHING HAMLET TO ECUADORIAN SS AND FINALLY THERE IS A BRIEF EXCITEMENT FOR FANS OF A LEGENDARY CREATURE WITH THE WORDS
LOCH NESS MONSTER FOUND IT'S ON THE FRONT OF THE GUARDIAN IF YOU LOOK A LITTLE BIT CLOSER AND READ INSIDE THOUGH THE IMAGES THAT ARE IN A NUMBER OF THE PAPERS OF THE NESSIE SHAPED OBJECT FOUND BY A NEW ROBOT THAT EXPLORE THAT'S EXPLORING AREAS NOT REACH BEFORE
IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE DISCOVERY OF THE CENTURY SAYS THE TELEGRAPH TURNED OUT THERE TO BE A PROP FROM A NINETEEN SEVENTIES FILM THAT'S A PROMISE REALLY COS WE REALLY THOUGHT THE MONSTER HAD BEEN BRIEFLY DID WHAT WHEN WE CAME HERE AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IT'S NOT EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW ROBERT DE NERO IS TRY BECCA FILM FESTIVAL KICKED OFF LAST NIGHT WITH AN OPENING DOCUMENTARY CALLED FIRST MONDAY IN MAY SET MOSTLY WITHIN THE CONFINES OF NEW YORK'S PRESTIGIOUS METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART
TRY BECAUSE ORGANISERS MUST HAVE BEEN HOPING THAT THAT FILM WHAT YOU PLEASE PLENTY OF GLAMOUR WOULD DEFLECT ATTENTION AWAY FROM ANOTHER TRY BECCA DOCUMENTARY WHICH LINKED VACCINATIONS TO AUTISM SORRY WHICH LINKED VACCINATIONS TO AUTISM AND IT TURNED INTO A HUGE FIASCO FOR THE FESTIVAL WHICH IS NOW IN ITS FIFTEENTH YEAR FROM NEW YORK TOM BROOK REPORTS
LOOKING UP THE NORTH FACE OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE
IT APPEARS AT LEAST FROM THE SPANISH BY BED SOMETHING HAS HIT SOMETHING HE TAPS ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO LED TO THE BIRTH OF THE TRI BECCA FILM FESTIVAL IT WAS STARTED AS A CIVIC RESTORATION PROJECT TO BRING LIFE BACK TO THE CRY BECCA NEIGHBOURHOOD TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA WHERE THE TWIN TOWERS FELL TODAY ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK THERE IS PRAISED FOR THE FESTIVAL
I THINK IT'S DONE A LOT TO CHANGE THAT I THINK IT'S SO BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE PILLION IS TO THE FOREST
OTHERWISE MAY NOT BE HIGHLIGHTED FESTIVAL CO FOUNDER JANE ROSENTHAL SEES THE FESTIVAL AS HAVING ACHIEVED A LOT OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS A GREAT COMMUNITY OF FILM MAKERS ARE GREAT SPIRIT OF A REBUILT DOWNTOWN AND A HUB FOR US TO BE ABLE TO
SCREAM SCREAM FILM AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS BUT THIS ROSY PICTURE HAS BEEN MARRED THIS YEAR BY A BIG CONTROVERSY INCLUSION OF THE DOCUMENTARY BACK FROM COVER UP TO CATASTROPHE IN THE LINE UP
EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN TELLING MY PATIENTS FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS IT WAS STYLE I LIKE
THE FILM SUGGESTS A CONNECTION BETWEEN VACCINATIONS AND AUTISM A LINKAGE WIDELY DISCREDITED BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AFTER PROTESTS THAT TRY BECCA WAS GIVING A PLATFORM TO A FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTARY THE FESTIVAL WITHDREW THE FILM THIS WAS NOT GOOD NEWS FOR THE TEAM WHO CREATED IT WHICH INCLUDED BRITISH ANTI VACCINATION ACTIVIST ANDREW WAKEFIELD AND HIS COLLABORATOR DEL BIG TREE THE FILM'S CO WRITER AND PRODUCER HE BELIEVES THAT TRY BECCA HAS ENGAGED IN CENSORSHIP AND THAT'S IT FOR THE TRIBE
YOU LEARN THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THREE MONTHS SPEECH I THINK YOU'VE REALLY HURT YOUR FESTIVAL I LOVE TREVOR PROFESSOR WHAT I HOPE THAT THEY BOUNCE BACK FROM THIS IN THE WAKE OF ALL THE PROTEST AGAINST THE FILM ROBERT DE NERO AND HIS TEAM CLEARLY FOUND THE DOCUMENTARY TOO MUCH OF A LIABILITY TO HAVE IN THE TRI BECCA LINEUP
WHAT I LEARNED THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE OR POSTAL FOR CERTAIN REASONS THAT I DIDN'T I DON'T KNOW IF I AGREE WITH I'M NOT SURE I COULD I'M NOT SURE IN ANY CASE IT DID GET ATTENTION HARDLY ENOUGH IN AN INDIRECT WAY AND
LET THE CHIPS FALL THEY MATE WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT OVER THAT QUITE A FEW PEOPLE HAVE THAT THERE HAS TO BE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION THEREFORE YOU INCLUDE EVERYTHING I AGREE BUT I FELT THAT BECAUSE OF ALL THIS CONTROVERSY AND MAYBE MISUNDERSTANDING THERE
IT'S BETTER I JUST NEED TO HAVE THE FILM IN THERE IN THE FIRST OF ALL AT THIS PERCEIVED TO AFFECT THE FESTIVAL AWAY THAT IN SPITE OF THE CONTROVERSY TRY BECCA IS GETTING ON WITH BUSINESS TRANSITIONING GOING FROM BEING A PLAIN OLD FASHIONED FILM FESTIVAL TO ONE WITH A LOT OF ENERGETIC SIDE SHOWS THIS YEAR IN ADDITION TO ONE HUNDRED PLUS FILMS THERE ARE SIXTEEN TELEVISION EVENTS AND THIRTY EIGHT VIRTUAL REALITY EXHIBITS AND A SLATE OF TALKS WITH WELL KNOWN FIGURES IN CINEMA
BUT DESPITE ALL ITS CREATIVE ENERGY TRY BECKER IS YET TO FULLY DEFINED ITSELF AS A FESTIVAL AT LEAST THAT'S THE VIEW OF NEW YORK OBSERVER CONTRIBUTOR STEPHEN GARRETT BACK HAS YET TO HAVE A REAL BREAK OUR MOMENT WHERE THEY HAVE AN AMAZING
FILM THERE'S A THUNDERCLAP AND KENNETH OPENS THE FLOODGATES FOR REALLY GOOD MOVIES TO TO BE A TRY BACKER OR A REALLY BIG ACQUISITIONS BY DISTRIBUTORS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT MOVIES TO PICK UP
TRY BECKER IS A FESTIVAL WHICH DOES WELL WITH ANNIVERSARIES THIS YET HE'S MARKING THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF AN ICONIC NEW YORK FILM TAXI DRIVER WHICH STARS ONE OF ITS OWN ROBERT DE NERO IN A MEMORABLE PERFORMANCE AS THE ALIENATED CAB DRIVER TRAVIS BICKLE IN A PICTURE IN WHICH HE UTTERS ONE OF HIS BEST KNOWN LINES YOU TALKING TO ME
THE FILM DIRECTED BY MARTIN SCORSESE OFFERED DE NERO A LOT OF CREATIVE FREEDOM
WE HAVE THE RICE SOME PARTS ARE REARED AS POOR OLD MOORISH LOUISA'S IMPROVISATION THAT I'VE DONE WITH HIM AND SOME OF THE DESTRUCTION
IT'S ALL STRUCTURED BUT THING WITHIN THE STRUCTURE YOU DO IN PRIVATE
FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER IT BEGAN TRY BECCA IS NOT AMONG THE GIANTS IT'S NOT CANNES OR VENICE AT TIMES IT HAS STRUGGLED WITH ITS IDENTITY IT IS A FESTIVAL STILL IN THE MAKING BUT IT HAS ESTABLISHED A PERMANENT PRESENCE GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION IT ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST MEDIA CAPITALS AND THAT'S NO SMALL FEAT
TOM BROOK REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING IS BISHOP RICHARD HARRIS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
I SUSPECT THAT FOLLOWING THE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIKE ME HAVE BEEN DOING A BIT OF THINKING IN RECENT DAYS ABOUT PERSONAL IDENTITY ABOUT WHO WE REALLY ARE AND WHAT MAKES US WHAT WE ARE
WE KNOW THAT A GOOD DEAL OF US COMES FROM OUR GENES AND TRACING FAMILY HISTORY SEEMS TO GET MORE POPULAR BY THE YEAR YOU CAN BE FASCINATING TO FIND OUT ABOUT HER GRANDPARENTS AND THEIR PARENTS BEFORE THEM
BUT A MORE IMPORTANT INFLUENCE SURELY IS THE IMPACT OF OUR UPBRINGING ESPECIALLY WHETHER IT WAS A LOVING AND STABLE WHOEVER BOUGHT US OUT
BUT IS THAT ALL WE ARE A COMBINATION OF GENES AND UPBRINGING THAT'S WHY THE ARCHBISHOP'S ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WAS SO THOUGHT PROVOKING HE FOUND HIS IDENTITY HE SAID NOT THROUGH HIS GENETICS BUT HIS FAITH THREE CHEERS FOR THAT
I ONCE GOT TO KNOW SOMEONE WHO OUT OF THE BLUE STARTED ATTENDING SERVICES AT THE CHURCH AT I WAS WORKING HE TOLD ME THAT BOTH HIS PARENTS WERE DROWNED ADDICT ADDICTS AND HIS EARLIEST MEMORY IS OF THEM CRAWLING HELPLESSLY AROUND THE ROOM AFTER THIS RACKETY START HE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AND EVENTUALLY BECAME A MALE PROSTITUTE
THEN AFTER TELLING ME THE REST OF HIS STORY HE ALMOST SHOUTED OUT ENJOY OUT OF THIS MESS HAS COME TO ME
EVERYONE'S LIFE HAS A BIT OF MESS AND IT BUT OUT OF A MIX OF GOOD AND BAD EXPERIENCE COMES A UNIQUE ME THE SPECIAL PERSON WHICH EACH ONE OF US AND THAT'S NOT THE END OF IT
WE'RE ON THIS EARTH I BELIEVE TO LIVE AND GROW INTO THE FULLNESS OF THE PERSON WE HAVE IT IN US TO BE AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THAT POTENTIAL IS A VAST MUCH MORE THAN WE USUALLY DEATH
ONE OF THE GREAT FIGURES TO COME OUT OF WORLD WAR TWO WAS DIETRICH BON HOFFA WHO WAS HANGED FOR TAKING PART IN THE PLOT AGAINST HITLER IN PRISON HE WROTE A LITTLE POEM CALLED WHO AM I
IN IT HE CONTRASTED HOW OTHER PEOPLE SAW HIM CONFIDENT AND I'M AFRAID WITH HOW WE FELT INSIDE HIMSELF WEARY AND EMPTY AND FAINT AND READY TO SAY FAREWELL TO IT ALL AS HE PUT IT HE ENDS UP WHO AM I THEY MOCK ME THESE LONELY QUESTIONS OF MINE
WHOEVER I AM THOU KNOWEST OH GOD I'M DYING
WHO WE ARE IS UNFINISHED BUSINESS IT'S NOT JUST WHAT THE PAST US GIVEN US OR WHAT OUR OWN CHOICES BAD I'M GOING TO HAVE MADE US BUT WHERE WE FEEL WE BELONG NOW AND WHERE WE THINK OUR FUTURE LIES
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BISHOP RICHARD HARRIES IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT IS PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DECISION THIS COUNTRY WILL MAKE FOR HALF A CENTURY YOU COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING THAT THE DEBATE ABOUT OUR FUTURE IN EUROPE IS ONE OF INTEREST ONLY TO THE TWO WARRING WINGS OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TODAY WE'RE TOLD THAT THAT WILL CHANGE THE LABOUR LEADER WHO VOTED NO TO EUROPE IN THE REFERENDUM HELD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WILL GIVE HIS FIRST
BIG SPEECH EXPLAINING WHY HE WANTS PEOPLE TO VOTE YES TO REMAIN ANY THIS TIME AROUND WE'RE INVITED MISTER CORBIN'S COME ON THE PROGRAMME TO EXPLAIN HIS VIEWS BUT HIS OFFICE DECLINED BUT WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE THE SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY HERE REALLY BUT HILARY BENN INSTEAD MORNING TO YOU MISTER BENN
GOOD MORNING NICK WHY SHOULDN'T LABOUR FIGURES PERHAPS THIS IS WHAT MISTER CORBETT HIMSELF HE'S BEEN DOING SIT BACK AND WATCH CAMERON AND OSBORNE TRY AND GO HEAD TO HEAD WITH BORIS IAIN DUNCAN SMITH MICHAEL GO WHY NOT JUST ENJOY THE TORY WAR
BECAUSE THIS YOU'VE SAID YOURSELF NICK THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION ABOUT OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD A PLACE IN EUROPE POTENTIALLY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT WE HAVE FACED AS A COUNTRY FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AND WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT WISE LABOUR UNITED AND PASSIONATE ABOUT BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IT'S BECAUSE OF THE JOBS THE INVESTMENT THE GROWTH IT HAS BROUGHT US THE PROTECTION OF WORKERS' RIGHTS THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT IT CONTRIBUTES TO A SECURITY IN A WORLD THAT IS
DANGEROUS AS WE CAN SEE AND IT GIVES BRITAIN AND BRITAIN'S VOICE GREATER INFLUENCE AND STRENGTH IN THE WORLD AND I WOULD SAY I MEAN JEREMY SPEECH TODAY I THINK WE'LL SURPRISE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE AND THE ARGUMENT THAT HE IS MAKING IS ALL THE STRONGER BECAUSE THE LABOUR PARTY JEREMY I LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ON A JOURNEY OVER THOSE LAST FORTY YEARS THE WORLD HAS CHANGED
AND THE TRUTH IS IF YOU WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH THE GREAT CHALLENGES OF THIS CENTURY PEACE AND SECURITY CLIMATE CHANGE ECONOMIC PROGRESS TACKLING POVERTY THEN THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO THAT IS TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS AND BEING PART OF THIS HUGE IMPORTANT MARKET WITH GREAT
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INFLUENCE IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT QUITE A JOURNEYS YOU SAY SURPRISING AS YOU SAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LONG AND HONOURABLE TRADITION OF OPPOSITION TO THE E.U. AND BEFORE THAT THE COMMON MARKET YOU DON'T NEED TELLING THAT SHE GREW UP IN THE BEN HOUSEHOLD SO LET ME PUT SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE E.U. FROM THE LEFT TO YOU IT TAKES AWAY FROM NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS THE POWER TO SET ECONOMIC POLICY IT HANDED OVER TO AN UNELECTED SET A BANK
THAT IS NOT THE CASE THE FACT IS IT STRENGTHENS OUR ECONOMY LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THAT COMES INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM NOW IT'S BECAUSE WITH THE FIFTH STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A LOT GOING FOR OURSELVES AS A COUNTRY WE'RE PART OF THE LARGEST SINGLE MARKET IN THE WORLD BRITISH BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TARRY FREE WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SET THAT ON ONE SIDE AND FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF SAY BRITISH CARS WE SELL WHAT JUST UNDER TWO THOUSAND
CARS A DAY TO THE REST OF EUROPE HAVING TO FACE A TARIFF BECAUSE THE LEAF CAMPAIGNERS CANNOT SAY AS YOU KNOW WHAT A TRADING RELATIONSHIPS WITH B. THEY'RE INVITING US TO SWAP WHAT WE HAVE NOW
IN RETURN FOR COMPLETE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE AND THE FACT IS IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY NEURO FORGIVE ME IS THE PROJECT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO CREATE A HUGE FREE MARKET EUROPE
THIS THE SINGLE MARKET IN WHICH COULD MOVE FREELY HAS BEEN GOOD FOR BRITISH BUSINESS BRITISH WORKERS' JOBS FAMILY INCOME MY THEN THOSE COMMON AINSLEY DANGEROUS ROAD WE'RE NOTES FROM A MAN CALLED JEREMY CORBIN THE FIRST ONE WAS A QUOTE FROM MISTER CORBIN IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE SECOND ONE WAS A QUOTE FROM MISTER COOGAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THE FACT IS JEREMY CORBIN BEFORE HE BECAME LABOUR LEADER HAS CONSISTENTLY ARGUED AGAINST THAT YOU AS A FREE MARKET RAMP
WELL I SUSPECTED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TELL ME THAT THE TRUTH IS WE HAVE BEEN ON A JOURNEY AND THAT JOURNEY IS INCLUDED JEREMY WHAT YOU DO YOU SPEAK THAT PEOPLE CAN REGARD REGARDED SINCERE
LISTEN TO THE SPEECH THAT HE IS GOING TO MAKE TODAY AND IT COMES ACROSS REALLY CLEARLY
WHY HE BELIEVES THAT THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO THE BEST THING FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE IS TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION PRECISELY BECAUSE IT GIVES US THE BEST HOPE WE HAVE OF DEALING WITH THE GREAT CHALLENGES O.K. WE HAVE
FORGIVE ME INTERRUPTING BUT HERE IS A CHALLENGE THAT'S CONTEMPT NO TRICK IN THIS I'LL TELL YOU THIS IS A QUOTE FROM MISTER CORBIN IT IS A THREAT TO THE N.H.S. TO EVERY PUBLIC SERVICE A THREAT TO EVERY RIGHT DEIGNED BY TRADE UNIONISTS IN THE U.S.A. AND ANYWHERE IN EUROPE IT WAS JEREMY CALLING AT THE DURHAM MINERS' GALA ABOUT THE TRADE DEAL CURRENTLY BEING NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE E. U. N. U. S. WHICH MIGHT BE CONCLUDED BY THE END OF THE YEAR HE JUST REALLY DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A MAN IS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE EWE DOES
WELL HE WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE KEY TAPE AND THERE'S AN ARGUMENT GOING ON ABOUT WHAT ITS CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE BUT I TELL YOU THIS BUT WE WILL NOT AGREE AS A NATION AND THE LABOUR PARTY WON'T IN THE LABOUR M.E.P.S WELL DO YOU KNOW THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WON'T AGREE TO ANY TRADE DEAL WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THAT IN ANY WAY THREATENS OUR NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE AND OUR RIGHT TO RUN IT'S PUBLICLY BUT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A BIT OF EUROPE BEFORE THERE'S ANY PROSPECT OF HER LABOUR
I WAS GOING TO GO ON TO SAY IF BY ANY CHANCE WE AS A NATION WERE TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THIS REFERENDUM WHO WOULD BE LEFT NEGOTIATING A TRADE DEAL WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THEY CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT LED BY DAVID CAMERON THE TRUTH IS THAT REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS OUR BEST PROTECTION OUR BEST WAY OF ENSURING THAT WE GET A GOOD DEAL THAT BRINGS
JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BRITISH WORKERS COS THE RIGHT KIND OF TRADE DEAL WITH UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WOULD BE A GOOD THING BUT WE'RE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ALL OF US UNITED THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO BE AGREED THEN ANYWAY THREATENS OUR NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE THE LAST BRIEF ONE IF YOU WOULD MY HOW WORRIED ARE YOU WE HEARD EARLIER FROM VOTERS ON THE LEFT A REAL SENSE THAT THEY ARE DRIFTING AWAY FROM SUPPORTING THE E.U. ARE YOU ANXIOUS
LOOK WE'VE GOT A BIG FIGHT ON OUR HANDS BUT WE'VE SET UP A CAMPAIGN ALAN'S LEADING IT GERRY ISN'T MAKING HIS SPEECH TODAY THE SHADOW CABINET THE PEEL P. STRONGLY AND SUPPORT AND I JUST MAKE THIS POINT FRANKLY IF MORE OF THE WORLD COULD WORK TOGETHER TRADE TOGETHER AND CO OPERATE TOGETHER AS THE EMU DYER'S WE WOULD HAVE MORE PROSPERITY MORE PROGRESS AND MORE PEACE IN THE WORLD AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT IS A REALLY STRONG ARGUMENT FOR STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HILARY EVENT THANK YOU SO MUCH

THE LABOUR PARTY JEREMY I LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ON A JOURNEY OVER THOSE LAST FORTY YEARS THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND THE TRUTH IS IF YOU AND WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH THE GREAT CHALLENGES OF THIS CENTURY PEACE AND SECURITY CLIMATE CHANGE ECONOMIC PROGRESS TACKLING POVERTY
THEN THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO THAT IS TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS HOWEVER THIS MORNING THE LABOUR DONOR AND LEAVE CAMPAIGNER JOHN MILLS SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED BY MISTER CORBIN'S DECISION WHICH SHE SAID RISK TO FURTHER ALIENATING DISAFFECTED LABOUR VOTERS
MANY PRO E.U. LABOUR M.P.S ARE ALSO DEEPLY ANXIOUS ABOUT MISTER CORBIN STANCE BUT BECAUSE THEY FEAR HIS DOUBTS ABOUT EUROPE AND LACK OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE CAMPAIGN RISKS DAMAGING ATTEMPTS TO MOTIVATE LABOUR VOTERS WHICH COULD DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM
SEVERAL LARGE INVESTORS IN THE OIL GIANT B. P. ARE PLANNING TO VOTE AGAINST HER DECISION TO GIVE A TWENTY PERCENT PAY RISE TO ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE BOB DUDLEY THEY'RE ANGRY THAT HIS PAY PACKAGE WILL RISE TO ALMOST FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS AT A TIME WHEN B.P.'S PROFITS HAVE BEEN FALLING
THE COMPANY WHICH IS HOLDING ITS ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING LATER TODAY HAS DEFENDED THE INCREASE SAYING ITS PERFORMANCE HAS SURPASSED EXPECTATIONS ARE BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JONTY THEM REPORTS IN THE PAST YEAR B.P. HAS AXED THOUSANDS OF JOBS AND MADE ITS BIGGEST ANNUAL LOSS FOR TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE MASSIVE FALL IN THE PRICE OF OIL THAT WAS PERHAPS INEVITABLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE PAY OF ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE BOB DUDLEY IS SET TO SOAR BY EMMA'S TWENTY PER CENT
HIS BASIC PAY IS GOING TO INCREASE ONLY SLIGHTLY TO ONE POINT THREE MILLION POUNDS BUT A COMPLEX SERIES OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES ON SAFETY PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COST CUTTING MEAN HE'LL MAKE FAR MORE THAN THAT SEVERAL LARGE INVESTORS IN B.P. HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT MY DUDLEY'S PAY DEAL AND EXPECTED TO VOTE AGAINST IT AT TODAY'S A.G.M. THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS URGE SHAREHOLDERS TO SCRUTINISE THE PAY DEAL ARGUING THAT IF ENDORSED IT COULD SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE TO OTHER COMPANIES
IT SAID MY DUDLEY'S FOURTEEN MILLION POUND PAY PACKAGE WOULD SEEM UNJUSTIFIED TO MANY SHAREHOLDERS CONSIDERING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS TODAY'S VOTE IS ONLY ADVISORY AND THEREFORE VERY UNLIKELY TO STOP THIS PAY AWARD

THERE HAS RECENTLY BEEN AN INCREASE IN NUMBERS IT'S STILL NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND PERSONNEL SHORT OF THAT GO SO IT'S BEEN SPENDING MILLIONS OF POUNDS ON RECRUITMENT IT'S ALREADY FOUND THAT MOST YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL THEY DO NOT HAVE THE TIME OR COMMITMENT TO BECOME A PART TIME SOLDIER THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO SHOW THAT THEY DO THE ARMY WANTS TO APPEAL TO THOSE WHO FEEL THEY'RE WASTING THEIR TIME BY OFFERING THEM THE CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
NEW RESEARCH SUGGEST THE SECRET TO LONG TERM WEIGHT LOSS IS TO STAY ON A STRICT DIET FOR A YEAR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CALORIES EATEN IS KNOWN TO TRIGGER A DEFENCE MECHANISM IN THE BODY WITH HUNGER CAUSING HORMONE SURGING AND SELL STORING MORE FAT BUT SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN FOUND IT WILL BE HIS PEOPLE WHO LOST AN EIGHTH OF THEIR WEIGHT AND KEPT IT OFF FOR A YEAR THEN SAW A CHANGE IN THEIR BODY CHEMICALS PROFESSOR A SORENSON TONIC OFF WHO LED THE RESEARCH TOLD US IT BECAME EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO EAT LESS
IF YOU ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A TWELVE KILO DIED INDUCED WAKE ASKED FOR ONE YEAR THEN THEIR HUNGER HORMONE EXLEY DECREASES AGAIN WHEREAS THE INCREASED LEVELS OF DEBT EVER TIED INHIBITION HORMONE DO YOU'LL BE ONE IS SUSTAINED SO IT SEEMS THAT THE BODY IS REACHING A NEW SET POINT WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY PROBABLY HELP YOU SUSTAINED THIS NEW WEIGHT
THE INDEPENDENT CHIEF INSPECTOR OF BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION HAS CRITICISED THE USE OF SEARCH DOGS AT MANCHESTER AIRPORT HE SAID THE DOGS WERE FAILING TO DETECT CLASS A. DRUGS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ADEPT AT SNIFFING OUT CHEESE AND SAUSAGES MORE DETAILS FROM DANNY SURE
MANCHESTER AIRPORT THE U.K.'S THIRD LARGEST HAS SIX DETECTOR DOGS AND NEW KENNELS WHICH COST ONE AND A QUARTER MILLION POUNDS BUT ACCORDING TO THE REPORT THE INVESTMENT IN THE DOG UNIT IS NOT DELIVERING THE RESULTS IT SHIRT WITH A HEROIN AND COCAINE WERE ASSESSED AS VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE SEARCH TEAM NO CLASS A. DRUGS HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE DOG'S IN A SEVEN MONTH PERIOD TO JUNE LAST YEAR
ONE DOG TRAINED TO FIND ANIMAL PRODUCTS ARE DETECTED MANY ITEMS ACCURATELY BUT THE REPORT SAID MOST WERE SMALL AMOUNTS OF CHEESE OR SAUSAGES BROUGHT BACK BY BRITISH HOLIDAY MAKERS INSPECTOR SAID IT WILL BE A MORE STRATEGIC VALUE TO TARGET FLIGHTS WHERE THE DOG MIGHT FIND BUSH MEAT WHICH COULD POSE CONSIDERABLE THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH
DANNY SHAW REPORTING IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS THAT'S HOW MUCH B. P. WANTS TO PAY ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE BOB DUDLEY AND YET THE COMPANY'S JUST ANNOUNCED A LOSS OF THREE POINT SIX BILLION POUNDS AND IS GETTING RID OF THREE THOUSAND JOBS THIS YEAR ON TOP OF FOUR THOUSAND LAST YEAR
EVEN THE IODINE YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO DEFEND COMPANY BOSSES HAVE TOLD B.P. SHAREHOLDERS THAT APPROVING THE TWENTY PERCENT PAY RISE AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING TODAY WOULD SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE
BOB DUDLEY TOOK ON THE JOB OF TURNING THE COMPANY AROUND IN TWENTY TEN SHORTLY AFTER THEM A CONDO DOWN DISASTER IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IN WHICH ELEVEN PEOPLE DIED HE TOLD THIS PROGRAMME IN JANUARY THAT DISASTER CHANGED THE COMPANY DRAMATICALLY IT SHOOK THE COMPANY TO ITS CORE
SOMETIMES IT TAKES A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE TO RADICALLY CHANGE YOUR COMPANY AND IF THEY WERE EVER A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE MECCANO WAS AT THE COMPANY ALMOST ONE UNDER PEOPLE KNOW THAT
HE FORCED US HERSELF FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A BOROUGH ASSETS AROUND THE WORLD SO IT WAS A FORCE TO FOCUSING DOWN OF WHAT WE DO IT WAS THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO SURVIVE
HE SAID SELLING OFF ASSETS TO PAY THE COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO DISASTER AND THEN REORGANISING THE COMPANY HAD TAKEN HALF A DECADE TO COMPLETE THE SCALE OF THE CHANGE HAS REQUIRED A COMPLETE CHANGE IN THE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF MANAGEMENT SO THAT TAKES TIME
IT'S A RECOGNITION THAT YOU CAN'T DO THIS CAN'T DO IT IN TWO AND FROM THE ROOM THREE YEARS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WHICH SAID KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE HORIZON THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD WORK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT EVERY DAY
THAT WAS BOB DUDLEY IN JANUARY WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW HERE IN THE STUDIO BY ISN'T BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK SIMON HELP US OUT ON ON THIS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A VERY LOW POINT FOR THE COMPANY BACK IN TWENTY TEN WHEN HE CAME ON BOARD BUT FORTY BILLION IT DOES LOOK LIKE REWARDS FOR FAILURE DOESN'T IT A TWENTY PERCENT PAY RISE WHEN YOU'VE LOST BILLIONS OF POUNDS THE PREVIOUS YEAR BUT THE QUESTION IS
WHAT IS FAILURE I MEAN IN WHAT HE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST YEAR IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST THE LAST TWO YEARS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CRASHES IN THE OIL PRICE WE'VE SEEN IN A GENERATION AND WHAT HE'S BEING REWARDED FOR WHY HE DESERVES IF YOU LIKE HIS BONUS IS THAT HE'S RESPONDED WITH GREAT ALACRITY TO THAT SITUATION YES HE'S BEEN CUTTING JOBS BUT HE'S BEEN KEEPING THE COMPANY WE WASN'T FOR THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE CONDO IT WOULD'VE BEEN PROFITABLE SO HE'S
DEALT WITH HER CONDUCT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM ON THE HORIZON FOR THE COMPANY AND BE HE'S RESPONDED VERY WELL TO A COLLAPSE IN THE OIL PRICE THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEING REWARDED FOR HAVING SAID THAT WOULD BE VERY HARD INDEED TO JUSTIFY A TWENTY PERCENT PAY RISE
WHEN THE COMPANY IN FACT HAS BEEN LOSING MONEY BUT WE'RE GOING TO VOTE TODAY I'M TO BE GOING TO THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING IF WE GET A TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT VOTE AGAINST THE PAY DEAL THEN THEY MAY GO BACK AND HAVE A HAVE A LOOK AT IT SHOP AND A PENCIL BUT IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS CAN STOP THIS DEAL GOING THROUGH ONE OF THOSE SHAREHOLDERS ARE SITTING ALONG SIMON IS HERE IN THE STUDIO ASHLEY HAMILTON KLAXON WHOSE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MANAGER AT THE FUND MANAGERS ROYAL LONDON AND YET GOOD MORNING TO YOU
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THIS SIZE OF THIS PAID NO WE DON'T TAKE THESE ISSUES LATELY WE INVEST IN PENSION SAVINGS AND LIFE SAVINGS OF FIVE NINE OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND IT'S OUR DUTY REALLY TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES QUITE CAREFULLY THE EXECUTIVES AS SIMON SAID RECEIVE THE MAXIMUM BONUS POSSIBLE IN A YEAR WHERE THEY MADE A RECORD LAST AND TO US THAT JUST DOESN'T TRANSLATE INTO A VERY GOOD DECISION MAKING BY THE BOARD
AND WE THINK LIKE EQUIPPED THAT SAID EARLIER IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE AND IT SORT OF SHOWS THAT THE BORDERS OUT OF TOUCH WITH THEIR SHAREHOLDER EXPERIENCE AT THIS YEAR
AND THE ARGUMENT THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS ALL DOWN TO A FORMULA THAT WAS SET A FEW YEARS AGO THE FORMULA WAS DEPENDENT ON SAFETY ON KEEPING CUSSED COS SLOW AND ON THOSE GROUNDS HE HAS DONE HIS JOB AND DONE IT WELL DON'T GET ME WRONG I THINK THE SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT HE'S BEEN REWARDED FOR A VERY IMPORTANT AS WE SAW WITH MECCANO
THOSE HAD VERY VERY MATERIAL RISK THEY WERE VERY CRITICAL OF THE BENSONS MANAGERS THOSE RISKS WELL THE ISSUE IS THE BOARD WE THINK SHOULD HAVE EXERCISED ADDITIONAL DISCRETION THIS YEAR COS ALTHOUGH HE'S MET THOSE TARGETS ULTIMATELY THE COMPANY NEEDS TO MAKE A PROFIT FOR SHAREHOLDERS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE AT ONE TIME JOURNEY O.K. SO YOU'RE HAPPY WITH BOB DUDLEY AT THE BAR AT THE TOP YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO PAID THAT MUCH WELL WE THINK THAT IT SENDS A MESSAGE IN TERMS OF PAYING A MAXIMUM BONUS WHEN HE'S MADE A SIGNIFICANT LOSS
WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT THERE REALISTICALLY BECAUSE SIMON WAS SAYING IF YOU CAN SCRATCH TOGETHER TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT YOU'D THEY'LL SINK AGAIN BUT IT'S JUST A SORT OF SIGNAL RATHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE ISN'T IT IT IS A SIGNAL I THINK IF THE BOARD DID GET TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AGAINST THEY WOULD NEED TO THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT THEIR DECISION THERE'S NO LEGAL REASON WHY THEY WOULD HAVE TO START THE PAY DEAL THE DEAL'S ONLY BEEN MADE THIS AS A RETROSPECTIVE VOTE SO MEANS WERE VOTING ON A DECISION THAT'S ALREADY BEEN MADE
BUT THIS IS A PRETEND NEED TO GIVE HER VIEWS WITH THE COMPANY AND HOPEFULLY HAVE FOR AN ENGAGEMENT WITH THE COMPANY CAN YOU GIVE US SOME SENSE OF HOW IT WORKS THERE BECAUSE OF MY UNDERSTANDING YOU WOULDN'T GO TO SHAREHOLDERS ABOUT SOME EXPECTATION YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT THROUGH HAVE THEY NOT ALREADY GOT SIGN OFF FROM SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDERS SOME COMPANIES WILL GO AND SPEAK TO SHAREHOLDERS AND ADVANCED TO TEST THE WATERS
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY IN THE BORDERS WITHIN THEIR REMIT WE DELEGATE THE AUTHORITY TO THE BOARD TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS ON OUR BEHALF WE SIMPLY HAVE A RETROSPECTIVE FELT SO DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW MANY SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE VOTING AGAINST IT MY SENSES UPWARDS OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT I THINK IF THAT WENT ON A MUCH ABOVE THAT WE THAT WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT I THINK EVEN TWENTY PERCENT WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT
AND THEN DO YOU THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN EASILY TODAY IT'S IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE YEAH O.K. LET ME BRING IN NOW ALSO WHO'S HERE IN THE STUDIO JOHN PURCELL HIS EXECUTIVE HEAD HUNTER PER CELL AND COMPANY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE DOING
WILL BE PIECE ABOUT THIS PLAN THREE YEARS AGO BOB DUDLEY HAS PERFORMED EXCEPTIONALLY WELL AGAINST THE CRITERIA LAID OUT SO YOU CAN'T REALLY FAULT THE GUY THIS IS A CASE OF HOPE IN THE GAME NOT THE PLAYER BECAUSE IT'LL DO US
HE WAS GIVEN A TASK IS FULFILLED US AND MARIE'S GETTING WAS REWARD SO ON THAT LEVEL YOU'VE GOT TO SAY FAIR ENOUGH BUT HE'S RUNNING THE COMPANY WHICH IS THERE'S AT LEAST IT'S DOWN TO HIM SURELY AND THE BOARD WHETHER THEY SAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IN THEORY LET'S LOOK AT THEM THE FORMULA AND IT COMES UP WITH THIS NUMBER BUT THE REALITY ON THEY BEING A BIT
YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT ARGUMENT HOWEVER THIS AS IS OFTEN SAID THIS IS A GLOBAL GAME
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE BOB DUDLEY GETS HARASSED ABUSED YOU KNOW HE'D BE WELL WITHIN HIS RIGHTS JUST LIKE STEVEN HAS STRIDOR B'STARD TO UP AND LEAVE AND THEN HIGHER UP WHERE WOULD THAT LEAVE THE COMPANY LEADERLESS WHICH IS NOT WHERE YOU WANT TO BE ALTHOUGH BUT P. P. ARE REPORTING A LOSS IT'S GOT TO BE CONSIDERED AGAINST THE ABSOLUTE CATASTROPHE THAT WAS KIND OF THE GULF OF MEXICO OIL SPILL AND TO RESCUE THE COMPANY FROM THAT SITUATION AND THEY GO VERY COMMENDABLE WHERE WOULD THEY BE IF HE DID
I THINK THEY'D BE IN A PRETTY DEEP HOLE BECAUSE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WOULD BE COULD THEY GET ANYBODY TO TAKE ON THE JOB BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY HAS APPROACHED TO BECOME THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF B.P. SO QUITE OF THE OLD KYLIE
BECAUSE HE WAS HER ASS OUT OF THE JOB I THINK I'M NOT TORTUROUS GOOD LOOK SO THERE IS A BUSINESS AND I MEAN THIS ISN'T EVEN IF YOU DO A FRACTION OF THE FOURTEEN MILLION SURELY THAT YOU KNOW AS A HEAD HUNTER YOU GO TO SOMEBODY WITH THOSE SORT OF FIGURES ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO HAVE THAT DIFFICULTY FELL IN THE HALL
ANYBODY WHO'S CAPABLE OF DOING THAT SORT OF JOB WILL PROBABLY TO HAVE DONE QUITE WELL FOR THEMSELVES ALREADY SO ARE RAW NUMBER ISN'T THE PRIMARY FACTOR THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY PERSONAL RISK THAT COMES WITH THIS AND IF YOU'RE GOING INTO A JOB WHERE YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE PUBLICLY VILIFIED THAT WILL COME WITH A SIGNIFICANT PREMIER
BUT SIMON AND THE LAST TIME WE HAD A SHAREHOLDER SPRING AS THEY CALLED IT A FEW YEARS AGO FROM SOMEONE MARTIN SORRELL HAD PAID A FORTUNE HE WENT BACK AND SAID ACTUALLY I'VE HEARD THE BOARD I'M GOING TO TURN MY PAY DOWN THE PROBLEM WITH BOB DUDLEY IS THAT HE IS WIDELY THOUGHT TO BE COMING TO THE END OF HIS PROFESSIONAL LIFE SO HE IS GOING TO HAVE YEARS FROM NOW WHEN WE VOTE ON THE NEW PRINCIPLES NEXT YEAR SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE ON NEW PRINCIPLES THE FORMULA'S BY WHICH SPIT OUT THESE BIG PAY AWARDS HE WILL PROBABLY
VERY HANDSOMELY RETIRED THEN HAVING TROUSERED THIS MONEY BUT IT WILL FALL TO SHAREHOLDERS TO VOTE ON THE FORMULA'S BY WHICH PRODUCE THESE NUMBERS NEXT YEAR SO THIS WILL BE A BIG SIGNAL TO THE BOARD TO TRY AND CHANGE THOSE FORMULA SO WE ALSO OF COURSE HAD THE CO OP BOSS RECENTLY SAYING LOOK I'VE DONE THE TURNAROUND OF CUT THE COSTS I DON'T NEED THIS BIG SALARY YOU'RE PAYING ME I'M GOING TO TAKE A CUT I COULD HEAR A GROAN IN AMONGST CHIEF EXECUTIVES AROUND THE COUNTRY WHEN HE DID THAT HE REALLY
WITH THE PITCH THAT THE COB IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT EXAMPLE OF DIFFERENT KIND OF COMPANY BUT HE CERTAINLY IT WAS AN INTERESTING BACK TO ONE IMAGINES THERE WAS A GROAN IN HEAD HUNTERS AS WELL BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU GET A CUT OF WHAT THEY SAY IT'S IN YOUR INTERESTS TO DEFEND THE LARGE GO
I DO I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING A LITTLE FOR MYSELF IN THAT WE WORK ON FIXED FEES NOT COMMISSION SO WE DON'T GET INVOLVED IN THESE TELEPHONE NUMBER PAY DEALS IT'S A IT'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD FIX THE TRANSACTION SO I UNFAIRLY TRADUCED THERE WHAT'S THEIR INTEREST IN THE ANALYSIS BY THE COUNT THE PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPING SUGGESTING THEY'RE ACTUALLY PAY PACKETS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVES ROSE BY AROUND
ONE PER CENT THIS IS OF THEY'D BE TO SURVEY OF FORTY SEVEN FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANY THEY ROSE BY AROUND ONE PER CENT WHICH IS BELOW THE INCREASE IN NATIONAL AVERAGE EARNINGS IT SUGGESTS THAT ALL THIS TALK OF A BIG PAY OR BIG INCREASINGLY BIG PAY IT'S NOT
IT'S NOT THE REALITY IT'S VERY EASY A B. P. IS SUCH A WELL KNOWN COMPANY IT'S A HOUSEHOLD NAME TO PICK POTTER CALLED OUTLIER AS THE EXTREMES AND UNE SITUATION BUT OVERALL THE REPORT IS CORRECT THERE IS A MODERATING AND PAVE WHICH I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE IS A GOOD THING BUT YOU KNOW IT'S EASY TO PICK ON HER ON A PANTOMIME VILLAIN AND TAKE THE CAN I ASK THE THREE OF YOU
IS THIS PAY HIS PAY YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS PAY FOR THIS YEAR ISN'T IT SIMON YOU'RE NODDING YES ASHLEY EVEN THOUGH YOUR VOTE AGAINST IT YOU DON'T THINK HE SHOULD HE WILL GET IT THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS A RETROSPECTIVE IF YOU IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET SOME OFF AND THROW PAID HE'LL BE VOTED IN A FEW DAYS' TIME THAT COULD BE AS MUCH AS SIXTY MILLION WHETHER WE GET A SHELL SPRING THAT BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE SIMON JACK ASHLEY HAMILTON KLAXON JUMP HERSELF THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY PAST EIGHT WHAT AN EARTH IS WRONG WITH MANCHESTER AIRPORT SNIFFER DOGS THEY'VE JUST GOT NEW KENNELS COSTING ONE AND A QUARTER MILLION POUNDS BUT AND IT IS A BIG BUT THEY ALL SEEM TO BE SNIFFING OUT CHEESE AND SAUSAGE IS BROUGHT INTO THE AIRPORT BY HOLIDAY MAKERS BUT ACCORDING TO NO LESS A FIGURE THAN THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION DAVID BOWLS THEY HUM NOT SNIFFING OUT ILLEGAL ANIMAL PRODUCTS
AND CLASS A. DRUGS WELL REGRETTABLY NO SNIFFER DOG FROM MANCHESTER WAS AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT THIS MORNING BUT WE CAN DO THE NEXT BEST THING ERIC IS IN THE STUDIO WITH HIS HANDLER STUART PHILLIPS FROM B. W. Y. K. WHO PROVIDES DETECTION DOGS AND COULDN'T REALLY EXPLAIN
THAT'S A BIT HOW EASY IT IS TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRUGS AND CHEESE AND SAUSAGES SO WELCOME TO YOU STUART
DOES THE SAME DOG WELCOME I SHOULD SAY TO ERIC DOES THE SAME DOG OR DETECT ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS
OR IS IT IN FACT DIFFERENT DOGS FOR DIFFERENT THINGS NO NORMALLY YOU HAVE DIFFERENT DOGS FOR A DIFFERENT JOB
I'M NOT AWARE OF THE FULL FACTS REGARDING MANCHESTER AIRPORT BUT FROM WHAT I I'VE READ THE THE DOG THAT THEY'VE GOT TRAINED THEY HAVE TO FIND PRODUCTS OF AN ANIMAL ORIGIN MEAT
VEGETABLES MAY BE DAIRY PRODUCTS THAT DOG IS IS DOING ITS JOB AND IT'S FINE HE'S FINDING STUFF THAT DOG WILL NOT BE TRAINED TO FIND ANYTHING ELSE
THEY WILL ALSO HAVE DRUG DETECTION DOGS THERE AND THEY'LL POSSIBLY ALPHA EXPLOSIVES SEARCH DOGS THERE AS WELL AND THEY'RE ALL THEY'RE ALL SEPARATE THEY'RE ALL TRAINED WHAT SPECIFICALLY TO SNIFF OUT WHATEVER IT IS YES AS A SAY ERIC HERE IS A PASSIVE DRUG DETECTION DOG HE'S USED TO SCAM PEOPLE
SO HE IS TRAINED TO FIND CASH AND DRUGS SERIOUSLY CASH YOU'VE BEEN TRAINED TO FIND YES YOU CAN YES THEY SMELL WHAT THEY SMELL THEM OUT THEY THE THE INK USED TO PRINT MONEY ON THE PAPER IS DIFFERENT TO ANY OTHER PAPER OR INK USED SO YES ERIC IS TRYING TO FIND
ILLEGAL DRUGS WERE POSSIBLY NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE ARE SOME DRUGS IN A B.B.C. STUDIO SHE HESITATED OF COURSE FIRST I'M IN THIS ONE THE TODAY PROGRAMME WE HAVE WE HAVE A CULPRIT HERE SO DO EACH WE LET ERIC DO STUFF OH KEEP HIM ON THE LEAD THERE HE'S GOING TO DO HIS THINGS
WE SHOULD IT WE'VE GOT A WHOLE HOST OF PEOPLE IN THE STUDIO THERE'S A DODGY PEOPLE NOD ANY ONE HERE WE GO ROB BONNET IS STAND STANDING UP HERE WHAT IS A VERY RELIABLE LIKE THAT CAR ARE YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THE DOGS LOOKING AT YOU ERIC HE'S JUST STARING AT ME
HE'S ABSOLUTELY CHARMING I THINK WHAT I'VE BEEN CALLED A DONKEY BEFORE IN MY AMATEUR FOOTBALL CAREER BUT NEVER A MEAL OH K. C. BASICALLY ROB YOU'VE GOT DRUGS IN YOUR POCKET I HAVE YES I HAVE HEARD OF WHAT IS IN YOUR POCKET I HAVE A LITTLE PLASTIC BAG HERE OF A CLASS A. HE CAME UP WITH A LOT IS HE WILL KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THAT WON'T WE
AT WHAT YOU JUST GAVE ERICA AND APPLE AS A REWARD NO TENNIS BALL OH SORRY INTENSE FOR I THOUGHT I THOUGHT WAS EXTRAORDINARY SO WE SHOULD EXPLAIN TO LISTENERS THAT ROB ON IT WAS PROVIDED WITH CLASS A. DRUGS ROTTEN ROUTINELY CARRIES THEM INTO THE APATHY OF AN EXPERIMENT YEAH I THINK THAT'S RIGHT
EXPLAIN ABOUT THE TRAINING BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE IN THE IMMEDIATE ASSUMPTION IS THAT HE THAT DOG HAS BEEN TRAINED TO BE ADDICTED TO DRUGS OH NOT AT ALL NO THE DRUGS THAT'S THE ROB HAS GOT THERE IN A SEALED PACKET THE DOGS NEVER COME INTO CONTACT WITH WITH THE WITH THE DRUGS THEY DON'T GET TO SNIFF THEM OR EAT THEM
AND SO THE TRAINING IS NOT HARMFUL TO THE DOGS IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER
AND WE WE SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT NOISES ERIC YES IT'S STILL YOU THANK HOPPED UP AGAINST THE WALL HE CAME HE'S A GRAB MY LEG IT WAS QUITE CLEAR WAS IDENTIFYING ME IS THAT AS THE CHARACTER BUT WHAT'S WHAT'S INTEREST O.K. WHAT IS INTERESTING IS SOME PEOPLE WERE FAMILIAR IF YOU BUT IF YOU GO TO A SECURITY CLEAR UP BEFORE A BIG POLITICAL SPEECH WAS ON WITH THE DOGS ARE SNIFFING ALL OVER THE PLACE ALL THE TIME ERIC
VERY QUIET LIKE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSEHOLD PET LOOKS IS IT'S ABOUT YOU I THINK IT'S THE SPRING ACROSS WITH A WORKING COCKER BUT HE DIDN'T DID HE HE WAITED FOR YOUR INSTRUCTIONS HE DID YES HE SORT OF COMING INTO THE STUDIO NOW HE'S BUILT UP TO THERE SEE YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE EXCITED HE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING HE KNEW THAT HE WAS SET SETTER
WE HAVE A WE HAVE A COCKER CALLED ELSIE WHO MIGHT LIKE TO MEET THERE IT WAS SUCH A GOOD LOOKING DOG YEAH AND I AM I AM NO BETTER THAT COIN AUSTRALIA POODLE CALLED SAT BROOD ALL SO WE SHOULD GET IT ALL TOGETHER I SHALL POINT WE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE DRUGS ON US AT THE TIME IT IS BECAUSE OF COURSE IF YOU TRAIN DOGS YOUR LICENCE HAVE DRUGS AND YOU CAN BRING THEM ON IN ORDER TO TO TEST THEM IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S RIGHT
WONDERFUL STUART PHILLIPS ERIC ROLE
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND ROB HE'LL GET HIS CHARGED YEAH YES COULD BE QUITE A LIVELY BUT COULDN'T IT DOWN IT'S A MAGIC IT WILL PLAY EVERTON ON THE WEEKEND OF APRIL TWENTY THIRD AT WEMBLEY AFTER WINNING THAT SIX ROUND CUP REPLAY AT WEST BY TWO GOALS TO ONE THE GAME'S UNDOUBTED HIGHLIGHT WAS ANOTHER STUNNING STRIKE FROM UNITED EMERGING STAR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD MARCUS RADFORD
THE RESULT COULD ALSO BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF MANAGER MOVE ON HARLAN THE LIKELIHOOD OF HIM CONTINUING AT OLD TRAFFORD NEXT SEASON AT CERTAINLY ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL F.A. CUP CAMPAIGN MIGHT ENHANCE HIS CHANCES BUT HE SAYS HIS PERSONAL FUTURE ISN'T RELEVANT IT'S NOT IMPORTANT FOR ME IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CLOP IT'LL PLAY AT FOURTEEN I HAVE SHIT I WANT THE TITLE OF COURSE I'M VERY HAPPY BUT AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THESE
I THINK YOU'RE A GOALLESS DRAW BETWEEN CRYSTAL PALACE AND EVERTON IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE DEFEAT AND ELIMINATION FOR HOLDERS BARCELONA THEY LOST TWO ZERO TO ATHLETICO MADRID THREE TWO ACROSS THE TWO LEGS THAT WAS THE MARGIN AS BAD MUNICH ALSO GOT PAST BEEN FEATURE AND INTO THE SENATE IT'S LIVERPOOL AGAINST BORUSSIA DORTMUND AT ANFIELD IN THE EUROPA LEAGUE TONIGHT ONE ALL AFTER THE FIRST LEG
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LANCASHIRE VERSES YORKSHIRE SPORTING RIVALRY THEN YOU'D SURELY CONSIDER RED ROSE VERSES WIFE IN COUNTY CRICKET OR MANCHESTER VERSES LEADS IN FOOTBALL BUT HOW ABOUT MANCHESTER THUNDER VERSES YORKSHIRE JETS
IN NETBALL THE FICTION NEXT MONDAY WILL PROVIDE THE CLIMAX TO THE SUPER LEAGUE SEASON WITH INTEREST GROWING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE ANTICIPATING A RECORD CROWD AT THE MANCHESTER ARENA AND TEAM CAPTAIN SARAH PAYMENT IS IN SALFORD STUDIO TO SARAH GOOD MORNING ACTUALLY THE INTEREST IN NETBALL CONTINUES TO GROW
YEAH IT'S HUGE I THINK WOMEN SPORT IS ON THE RISE IN GENERAL AND NETBALL IS REALLY BENEFITING FROM THAT THE THE CROWDS ARE INCREASING UNEARTHED T. V. COVERAGE ALSO SO IT'S GREAT TO GET GET THIS GAME OUT THERE IN THE ARENA AND HOPEFULLY GET A MASSIVE CROWD YEAH SOME IN THE CURRENT ATTENDANCE RECORD IS JUST OVER SIX THOUSAND WHAT KIND OF ATMOSPHERE DOES THAT GENERATE YEAH I MEAN THAT WAS A COPPER BOX DONE IN LONDON AND
IT DOES GENERATE AN ATMOSPHERE AND IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR THE PLAYERS YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S ALWAYS FANTASTIC TO PLAY IN FRONT OF A BIG CROWD SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THE ARENA ON MONDAY AND PACK IT OUT AND THIS IS ALL PART OF THE SPORT'S UPCOMING PROFESSIONALISM AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL OF COURSE
YEAH THEY'VE ANNOUNCED THAT ENGLAND PLAYERS ARE GOING TO GO FULL TIME AND I THINK IT'S LIKE I SAY IT'S JUST A SIGN OF HOW MUCH WOMEN SPORT IS GROWING AND HOW WE ARE ABLE TO COPY THE LIKES OF FOOTBALL AND CRICKET AND PROVIDE HIM IN FULL TIME CONTRACTS FOR PLAYERS DO WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF MONEY ENGLAND'S PLAYERS WILL BE
I DON'T THINK IT'S ALL LINED OUT QUITE YET BUT I MEAN HOPEFULLY PEOPLE BE ABLE TO LIVE COMFORTABLY IN AND KIND OF GET ON WITH WITH TRAINING FULL TIME AND BEEN THE BEST THEY POSSIBLY CAN BE IN THE RUN UP TO OUR HOME WORLD CUP IN TWENTY NINETY COULD BE MEASURED OBVIOUSLY NOT IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS BUT CERTAINLY IN TENS OF THOUSANDS IT'S DEFINITELY I'M SHOULD SET THAT HARRISON
NO I THINK I THINK THAT'S A BIT OF A PIPE DREAM BUT HOPEFULLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COURSE THEY'LL HAVE TO PROVIDE VALUE FOR MONEY WON'T THEY AND THAT MEANS A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO THE GAME'S MAJOR POWERS AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND YEAH I THINK THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS THAT WE CHALLENGE AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND WORLD CUP TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH IS IN LIVERPOOL AND TRY AND MAKE THAT FINAL AND KIND OF BREAK THE DOMINANCE OF THE TOP TWO IN THE WORLD AT THE MINUTE AND WITH PROFESSIONALISM OF COURSE COMES MEDIA EXPOSURE AND RECOGNITION IN THE STREET IS NETBALL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT YOU THINK
I THINK SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE A KIND OF GRADUALLY COMING TO TERMS WITH THEM IN TERMS OF GETTING RECOGNISED MORE AND BEING WITHIN THE MEDIA MOMENT IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LEARNING CURVE FOR THE ATHLETES AND THE MANAGEMENT IN NETBALL BUT HOPEFULLY IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL TAKE ENOUGH STRIKERS WE KIND OF LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS A FAMILY SPORT OH KAY SARAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THAT TAKES US TO A RACING TIPS FOR TODAY NEWMARKET THREE TWENTY NUMBER SEVEN HARLEQUIN CHELTENHAM THREE O'CLOCK NUMBER ONE ROBINS RICH

LOOK AT THE WEATHER SCATTERED THUNDERY SHOWERS IN THE SOUTH DRIER IN THE NORTH YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH MICK ROBINSON AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S NOW HALF PAST EIGHT TIME FOR SOME OF THE NEWS FROM SUSAN RAE THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CARBON WILL MAKE HIS FIRST SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE BY SAYING HIS PARTY IS OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN HE'LL SAY THAT'S A REFORMED Y. U. OFFERS THE BEST CHANCE OF MEETING THE CURRENT CHALLENGERS
SOME BIG ADVERSE INVESTORS AND B. P. OR TO OPPOSE PLANS TO AWARD IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE BOB DUDLEY A PAY DEAL WORTH ALMOST FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS B.P. INSIST THE PACKAGE REFLECTS ITS EXCELLENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE BUT ONE MAJOR SHAREHOLDER ASHLEY HAMILTON CLAXTON TOLD US IT SENT THE WRONG MESSAGE AND SURE THE FIRM WAS OUT OF TOUCH
VIDEO HAS EMERGED APPEARING TO SHOW SOME OF THE TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLGIRLS KIDNAPPED BY BOKO HARAM MILITANTS IN NIGERIA TWO YEARS AGO THEIR PARENTS WERE DEMANDING GREATER EFFORTS TO FREE THEM
EVIDENCE PROVING THE ZEKE A VIRUS CAUSES BRAIN DEFECTS IN BABIES HAS BEEN UNCOVERED IN THE U.S. IT'S HOPED THE DISCOVERY WILL PUSH FORWARD RESEARCH INTO A VACCINE
TO MIGRANTS BELIEVED TO BE FROM IRAN HAVE BEEN RESCUED FROM AN INFLATABLE OFF THE COAST OF DOVER OR PASSING FAIRLY SPOTTED A LIGHT FROM THEIR MOBILE PHONE THE MEN SAID THEY HAD BEEN AT SEA FOR EIGHT HOURS AND HAD NOT EATEN FOR TWO DAYS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE WELL FIGURES THAT HAVE COME OUT YESTERDAY SHOW THAT BRITAIN PAYS A POUND IN EVERY SEVEN POUNDS SPENT ON GLOBAL AID AND DEVELOPMENT
NOT ONLY THAT BUT IN FACT WE SPEND MORE PER HEAD THAN THE UNITED STATES WHICH PAYS MORE OVERALL OF COURSE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN PAYS ON AVERAGE OR HIS FUNDING THROUGH THEIR TAXES ABOUT SAKE SIXTY FOUR POUNDS AHEAD WHERE IS BRITAIN IT'S AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO POUNDS
SHOULD YOU SEE THIS AS A SOURCE OF PRIDE SOMETHING TO BE CELEBRATED OR AS THE MAIL AND THE SUN DO TODAY A SORT OF ANGER AND FRUSTRATION THE MAIL'S HEADLINE NEW FOREIGN AID OUTRAGE THE SONS WHAT WAD A WASTE JOINING ME TO DISCUSS THAT JONATHAN FORMERLY SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE THINK TANK SUPER TESTS AND AUTHOR OF AIDING AND ABETTING
FOREIGN AID FAILURES AND THE NOUGHT POINT SEVEN PERCENT DECEPTION BUT OF COURSE A REFERENCE TO THAT NOUGHT POINT SEVEN SENT G.P. TARGET WHICH THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S GOING TO MEET ANNE HAS BEEN MEETING AND ALONGSIDE HIM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CHARITY OXFAM MOCK GOLD RING JONATHAN FOREMAN FIRST OF ALL
WHY SHOULD WE NOT SIMPLY CELEBRATE WE'RE TAKING A GLOBAL LEAD WE ARE DOING SOMETHING THAT GOVERNMENTS FOR YEARS HAVE ASPIRED TO DO IT IS SOMETHING AT A TIME WHEN THERE ARE MANY MANY POOR PEOPLE THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM MANY MANY POOR PEOPLE THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WE SHOULD CELEBRATE
WELL I WOULD SAY THAT
WE HAVE TO RUN WITH A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPENDING MONEY ON AID OR SENDING MONEY ABROAD AND ACTUALLY HELPING PEOPLE I'D ALSO ARGUE THAT TO A GREAT DEGREE
THE REAL FUNCTION OF BRITAIN'S WHY WOULD SAY EXCESSIVE SPENDING IS ABOUT DE TOX FIND THE IMAGE OF CERTAIN POLITICIANS IT'S ABOUT MAKING US FEEL GOOD AND THERE'S AN ENORMOUS MORAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SORT OF THE ACT OF GIVING AID AND ACTUALLY HELPING PEOPLE AID EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFECTIVELY HELPING PEOPLE DELIVERING IT WAS VERY VERY DIFFICULT NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY QUESTION BUT THERE IS MONEY THAT'S WASTED BUT THERE'S MONEY THAT'S WASTED IN THE B.B.C. THERE'S NO DOUBT MONEY WASTED AT SUPER TAZ YOUR THINK TANK TOO
BUT IF MUCH MONEY GOES TO PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEEDS IT IMPROVES THEIR LIFE WHY SHOULDN'T BRITAIN SAY THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING WE DO BECAUSE THE MORE AID WE SPEND IF WE WE HAVE TOO MUCH MONEY AID BUDGET THAT MEANS IT'S GOING IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE SPENT LESS WELL AS IT IS DIFFERED HAS A GREAT DEAL OF PROBLEMS SELL IT SPENDING THE MONEY EFFICIENT IT CAN'T MONITOR ALL THEM WHEN IT GOES THROUGH AND MANY COUNTRIES ALSO UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE MONEY THAT'S ARRIVING
THAT ACTUALLY MAKES IT THERE'S A MORAL IT'S MORALLY PROBLEMATIC TO TO SPEND MONEY ON AID WE KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK AND WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO GO WRONG WHEN THAT MEANS DEFINITELY NOT HAVING MONEY FOR CANCER MEDICATION OR PEPYS OPERATIONS JUST BE CLEAR BEFORE I BRING IN MARK AUDREY A BOX BETTER ARE YOU SAYING I THINK GAY GENERALLY IS MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN AND IN FACT IT DOES BAD THINGS AS WELL AS GOOD OR YOU SAY I SIMPLY THINK THIS TARGET IS AN ARBITRARY POLITICAL TARGET WE COULD DO BETTER WITHOUT IT COS THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT POSITIONS
IT'S AND IT'S A COMPLETELY ARBITRARY TARGET MAY COME FROM A NUMBER THOUGHT UP BY THE WELL CANCEL CHURCH ISN'T CHANGED BY THE PEARSON COMMISSION YOU WERE IN A STATE NO I'M NOT AGAINST EIGHT I'M JUST AGAINST AND ONE FOR HONEST AID THAT'S GENUINE ACCOUNTABLE AID ISN'T JUST A GESTURE ISN'T ABOUT MAKING US FEEL GOOD MARK ULTRAVOX OXFAM THE TRUTH IS IT IS A TOTALLY ARBITRARY FIGURE ISN'T IT AND IT WAS ADOPTED BY THE CONSERVATIVES AS A PRETTY SIMPLE AND RELATIVELY CHEAP WAY OF MAKING THEM LOOK BETTER
I THINK IT'S A BRAVE AND A BOLD STATEMENT THAT BRITAIN CARES ABOUT ERADICATING POVERTY AROUND THE WORLD THAT WE WON'T LIVE WITH POVERTY AND WILL DO ALL THAT WE CAN AS A NATION TO TWO
GET RID OF IT AND MUCH OF IT IS HAVING AN AMAZING IMPACT WE NEED TO CELEBRATE MUCH MORE FULLY THAT WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF CHILDREN IN SCHOOL NOW WE HAVE MALARIA FALLING AT AN AMAZING RATE PEOPLE SURVIVING H.I.V. WHEN THEY WEREN'T WE HAVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHICH HAS BEEN ASSISTED NOT CAUSED BUT ASSISTED BY THE WAY THAT AID WORKS AND WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN BRITAIN
SUPPORTING THAT BUT YOUR WORD WAS STATEMENT IN A WAY PEOPLE LISTENING TO THAT IT MAKES A STATEMENT I JUST A BIT SUSPICIOUS THAT THAT'S WHAT HE'S REALLY ABOUT IT'S ABOUT PROCLAIMING PUTTING UP IN LIGHTS THAT WE CARE RUM ACTUALLY OFTEN DOING STUFF THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE I THINK WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BOTH FROM THE GOVERNMENT AID AND FROM NON GOVERNMENT ORGANISATION
THE AID BUDGET IS SCRUTINISED AS TIGHTLY AS ANY OTHER BUDGET THE IMPACT STUDIES SHOW THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING IMMUNISED THAT BED NETS ARE BEING PROVIDED BUT ALSO LET'S BE CLEAR THE SUM OF AID BEING PROVIDED AROUND THE WORLD IS STILL NOT ENOUGH TO ERADICATE POVERTY SO THE MORE WE DO THE BETTER JONATHAN FORM WELL RIPPED THE PROPER I WOULD SAID PART OF THE PROBLEM IS
THAT IS IT DOESN'T HAVE MANY MANY BAD EFFECT IT ALSO HAS AN ENORMOUS INDUSTRY THAT IT FEEDS AND WHAT WE'RE HEARING JUST NOW WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IS A GREAT DEAL OF A MARKETING OXFAM'S A CONTRACTOR FOR DEFEAT IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE A. E. GETS MONEY THAT MIGHT ARGUE FOR GREATER DEFENCE BUT HE'S A LOBBYIST YOU SAYING YES OR SOME WHO WERE HE'S ALSO CONTRACT HAS A DIRECT FINANCIAL INTEREST IN EVER GREATER RATE BUDGETS AND THAT DISTORTS THE DISCUSSION ON IT I WOULD SAY
PEOPLE DO OFTEN SAY YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN BED WITH GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE CHARITY PEOPLE SHOULD GIVE YOU MONEY COS THEY CHOOSE DON'T YOU SHOULD SPEND IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOUR DONORS WANT YOU TODAY AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO KNOW UNTIL IT WAS CANCELLED AT THE LAST MINUTE I WAS DUE TO COME ON THIS PROGRAMME ACTUALLY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT MORE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING TO RESPOND TO THE SYRIA CRISIS NOT JUST TO GET INTO BED WITH THEM SO WE RECOGNISE THAT WE HAVE HALF A MILLION DONORS
MONTHS WHO GIVE US MONEY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO POVERTY AROUND THE WORLD AND WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENTS BUT THE MONEY THAT CHARITIES LIKE OXFAM GET FROM GOVERNMENT IS TEN OR FIFTEEN PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL BUDGET MOST OF IT IS COMING FROM THE PUBLIC THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES WE COULD THINK OF WE'VE GOT TIME LET'S GIVE ONE THE ONE THERE OFTEN AN OUTRAGEOUS PEOPLE IS OFTEN ON THE FRONT PAGES OF PAPERS WE'RE GIVING MONEY TO INDIA I KNOW THAT'S ABOUT TO STOP WE'RE GIVING MONEY TO CHINA THEY SAY THESE ARE HUGELY WEALTHY COUNTRIES WHAT ON EARTH ARE WE DOING
FIRSTLY WE'RE NOT GIVING VERY MUCH MONEY TO CHINA AND WERE REDUCING WHAT WE GIVE TO INDIA THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING ECONOMIES LET'S ALSO RECOGNISE THAT THERE ARE MORE POOR PEOPLE IN INDIA THAN IN THE WHOLE OF AFRICA THERE ARE STILL TWO HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN EXTREME POVERTY IN CHINA BUT WE CAN'T LET THOSE RICH INDIANS LET THE CHINESE AND I'VE BEEN INTO THE BENTLEY GARAGE IN BEIJING AND THEY'D SELL MORE THERE THAN THE WHOLE OF EUROPE THAT IS A CONSIDERABLE WEALTH IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND THEY
GOT TO SPEND IT ON THE RIGHT THING BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE WALK AWAY IT'S A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IT'S GOT TO BE MADE IT'S NOT JUST GOVERNMENTS RESPONSIBILITY SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY COLONIAL ABOUT THAT PEOPLE IN INDIA GOVERNMENTS INDIA'S HIS ESTATE GET TO DECIDE WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE WE MAY NOT LIKE THIS PRIORITIES BUT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH IT'S ALL ABOUT US TELLING OTHER PEOPLE HOW TO LIVE THEIR LIVES I'M NOT SURE WE NECESSARY NO BETTER
BUT SINCE WE'RE NOT GOING TO AGREE THAT THANKS SPENT FAITH FOR COMING IN TO DISCUSS IT JONATHAN FORM NATIVITY MARKED ORDERING A BOXER THAT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TIMEWASTERS THAT'S THE JUDGEMENT OF THOSE WERE TRYING TO RECRUIT THOUSANDS TO BECOME RESERVISTS SOLDIERS THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME SOLDIERS IN THE ARMY HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY CUT IN THE PLAN'S BEEN TO REPLACE THEM BY BOOSTING THEIR NUMBERS AND ROLL OF THE TERRITORIAL ARMY THE TARGET IS TO TRAIN UP
THIRTY THOUSAND RESERVISTS BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO FAR ONLY TWENTY TWO THOUSAND HAVE BEEN RECRUITED WHEN THE ARMY RESERVE CARRIED OUT A SURVEY TO FIND OUT WHAT EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS WERE DOING WITH THEIR TIME THEY FOUND THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM SPENT THE EQUIVALENT OF A DAY A WEEK ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND GAMING BUT THE RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES ALSO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING JOSH OR HALL WAS IN THE T.A. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT LEFT IN TWENTY ELEVEN
I WAS IN THE TERRITORIAL ARMY WHICH IS NOW THE RESERVIST I WAS IN THERE FOR TWO YEARS I REALLY AND JUDGED TO BE HONEST IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE I DID LEARN A LOT OF SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE WHICH I STILL TALK ABOUT EVEN SO MANY YEARS AFTERWARDS AND I'VE MADE BETWEEN FRIENDS
UNFORTUNATELY MY PRIORITIES CHANGED TOWARDS THE END OF IT WITH COLLEGE WORK GIRLFRIENDS AND A PART TIME JOB I FOUND IT QUITE DIFFICULT TO JUGGLE ALL OF THEM TOGETHER BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S AND WEEKENDS AWAY AND THEN CHOOSE A NICE TRAIN AS WELL I WAS ALSO PREPARING TO GO TO UNIVERSITY AND THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT CHANGIN TEAR CENTRE OBVIOUSLY CHANGE THE REGIMENT I WAS IN
SO THAT ALONGSIDE OF UNI WORK IMPOSSIBLE PART TIME WORK AT UNIVERSITY I JUST IT WAS JUST BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO MAINTAIN ALFIE OTHER JOSHUA HALL THERE WERE GENERAL JOHN CRACK IT IS THE MOST SENIOR RESERVIST IN THE ARMED FORCES AND HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND GIVEN THE NUMBER THAT ARE LEAVING AS WELL AS THE GAP OF NUMBER THAT YOU NEED JUST TO TO RECRUIT HOW BIGGER CHALLENGES IT DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT
I THINK RECRUITING NEW EXPANDED RESERVE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR AN INDEPENDENT REPORT IN TWENTY ELEVEN TOLD US THAT I WAS AS WHEN DECLINE AND AT THAT STAGE A THOUSAND RESERVISTS WERE LEAVING EVERY YEAR
BUT WE'VE INVESTED IN THAT WE'VE GOT A BALL A GREAT PROPOSITION WOULD IMPROVE THE PROCESSES WE HAVE IMPROVED MARKETING AND ACTUALLY WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT THIS IS REMEMBER A
TWO YEARS INTO A FIVE YEAR PROGRAMME TARGETING THIRTY THOUSAND BY TWENTY NINETEEN WE'RE ACTUALLY AHEAD OF TARGET AGAINST THAT TARGET THIRTY THOUSAND WE'VE ACTUALLY SIGNED ON TWENTY EIGHT AND A HALF THOUSAND PEOPLE INTO THE ARMY RESERVE OF WHOM AS YOU SAY NEARLY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ARE FULLY TRAINED
MORE PEOPLE ARE JOINING A THIRD MORE JOINED LAST YEAR THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND ACTUALLY FEWER PEOPLE ARE LEAVING TEN PERCENT FEWER LET LEFT LAST YEAR THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR IT'S QUITE A NOVEL APPROACH THERE TO ACCUSE THE PEOPLE YOU'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT A BIG TIME WASTERS WELL OF COURSE I'M NOT REALLY DOING THAT THAT WOULD BE RUDE WOULDN'T IT IT'S NOT ME SAYING THIS THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS RESEARCH THAT WE'VE CARRIED OUT AND THE YOUNGER AGE GROUP
AND THAT'S FINE IF PEOPLE THAT'S HOW PEOPLE WANT TO SPEND THEIR LIFE THAT'S O.K. BUT WHAT IS SAD IS THAT THEY ALSO TELL US THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE SAME PEOPLE WANT TO LEARN NEW SKILLS HALF OF THEM WOULD WANT TO HAVE THEIR LIVES MORE FULL OF ADVENTURE AND EXCITEMENT AND AN ASTONISHING FIFTH OF THEM WANT TO SPEND THEIR SPARE TIME HELPING OTHER PEOPLE SO THE THRUST OF OUR CURRENT MARKETING CAMPAIGN IS TO SAY TO PEOPLE WELL LOOK YOU DO WASTE A LOT OF YOUR TIME
THE GRIT YOU HAVE THESE DREAMS WHICH ARE NOT REALISING EVENTUALLY SERVICE IN THE ARMY RESERVE DOESN'T TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS YOU THINK AND IT'S A REALISTIC PROPOSITION FOR YOU AND IT BE A GREAT WAY OF VIEW REALISING SOME OF THESE GOALS SO YOU'RE SPENDING OR BASICALLY A MILLION POUNDS ON THIS MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO TRY TO COMPETE WITH ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND SOCIAL MEDIA
WELL IT'S A DIGITALLY LED CAMPAIGN SO WE'LL BE WE'LL BE BLOW ON BENDING THE SOCIAL MEDIA WE'VE GOT OF COURSE HAVE A WEBSITE AND A CAMP IN THE GIST IS PUT DOWN YOUR DEVICE AND COME AND JOIN US THAT IF YOU WANT A MORE FULFILLING LIFE TILED LIFESTYLE IF YOU WANT TO BE FIT IF YOU WANT TO LEARN NEW SKILLS IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL
FOR ADVENTURE TRAINING THE OPPORTUNIST TO SERVE ALONGSIDE REGULAR SOLDIERS IN A WORTHWHILE WAY PERHAPS HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS PEACEKEEPING WE'VE GOT HAPS WHAT I MEAN YOU'RE MENTIONING HUMANITARIAN AND ALL THE PERHAPS MORE POSITIVE SIDE ARGUABLY THERE IS IT COULD BE ANOTHER WAR
THAT THE MAIN COMMITMENT BUT OF COURSE THAT RESERVE IS SIGNED UP TO IS FOR TRAINING AND THAT'S WHAT MOSTLY THEY ARE GOING TO DO EACH YEAR SO THEY'RE NOT SIGN UP TO GOT TO GO TO WAR IF THE COUNTRY WANTS THEM TO ABSOLUTELY AND BUT THE SPECTRUM OF OPERATIONS THAT WE COULD USE OVER SONY'S IS QUITE WIDE ON THAT VARIES FROM USING INDIVIDUALS MAYBE IN THE U.K. FOR SPECIALIST PURPOSES SMALL TEAMS HELPING TO TRAIN PEOPLE ABROAD WE HAD
THIRTY ODD RESERVISTS HELPING OUT WITH THE FLOODS IN CUMBRIA WE'VE CURRENTLY GOT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MAINTAINING THE GREEN LINE IN CYPRUS BETWEEN THE GREEKS AND THE PUT AND THE TURKS JAZZ WORTHWHILE ACTIVITIES GENERAL JOHN CRACK AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WHO SPEAKS FOR LEAVE WHO IN OTHER WORDS WILL LEAD THE CAMPAIGN TO TAKE THE U.K. OUT OF THE E.U. AND GET ALL THE PUBLIC MONEY IN THE MEDIA ATTENTION THAT GOES WITH THAT STATE AS WELL WE KNOW THE ANSWER IT WILL BE THE ORGANISATION WHICH CALLS ITSELF VOTE LEAVE THAT'S THE ONE THAT IS LED BY THE TORY CABINET MINISTER MICHAEL GO VERN INCLUDES BORIS JOHNSON OR MANY SENIOR CONSERVATIVES BUT BESIDES BUT CAN THEY REPAIR THE RIFT
WITH OTHER ANTI E.U. GROUPS WHICH IS TIMES RESEMBLE THAT SCENE IN LIFE OF BRIAN IN WHICH THE PEOPLE'S FRONT OF JUDEA GOES TO WAR WITH THE POPULAR PEOPLE'S FRONT OF JUDEA ON A MAN WHO OUGHT TO KNOW HE'S JOHN MILLS HE IS A LABOUR SUPPORTER INDEED IS CHAIR OF LABOUR LEAVE AND DEPUTY CHAIR OF VOTE LEAVE MY MEL'S ARE GOING TO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER
I THINK WE WILL YES I THINK THAT NOW THAT THE DESIGNATION IS SHE WAS OUT OF THE WAY THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY STRONG TENDENCY FOR EVERYBODY TO PULL TOGETHER TO TRY AND ACHIEVE THE RESULT HE WAS SO THE ANSWER IS YES THERE'S A REASON FOR THIS SPLIT ISN'T IT IS NOT JUST THERE IT IS PERSONAL BITTERNESS AND PETTINESS
IF YOU'RE A LABOUR SUPPORTER YOU MIGHT THINK THE LAST THING I WANT IS MICHAEL GO MOVE OR BORIS JOHNSON THE TWO MOST PROMINENT PEOPLE IN YOUR CAMPAIGN VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HEADING UP TO SAY LIVERPOOL OR GLASGOW CAMPAIGNING TO STAY IN HE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE NO I THINK THE SUB TRUTH IN THAT BUT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF THE CAMPAIGN IS THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONS APPEALING TO DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCIES
AND I THINK THAT WORKS WELL AND I'M SURE THAT MICHAEL GO FOR IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AND SO ON WILL APPEAL VERY STRONGLY TO TO CONSERVATIVE LEAVE VOTERS BUT WE NEED TO APPEAL TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT THE CONSERVATIVES WERE NOT SO LONG AGO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE HE'D BE VERY GOOD AT RALLYING PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE HE WAS CALLED MISTER JEREMY CORBIN NOW HE USED IT'S A VOTED AGAINST IN SEVENTY FIVE
QUOTED HIM EXTENSIVELY EARLIER USED TO SAY THAT THE PROJECT TAKES NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS POWER AWAY TO ECONOMIC POLICY THAT IT CREATES A HUGE FREE MARKET EUROPE AND SO ON EARTH HAS HAPPENED TO MY
I THINK THAT THE LABOUR PARTY GENERALLY IS VERY EUROPHILE IN MY VIEW TO EURO FARM HAVE BEEN GOT OUT OR HAS HE CHANGED HIS MIND AS HE SAYS AT LENGTH TO BE FAIR IN THE SPEECH HE DELIVERS TODAY WELL YOU SAID HE'S UP THERE AND TRAVEL A LONG DISTANCE OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS ALL SORT OF THING I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS LIMITED NUMBER OF FRONTS OF WHICH JEREMY CORN CAN FIGHT
WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY DON'T AGREE WITH HIM DO YOU THINK IF YOU GAVE IN THE TREES DRUG YOU'D SAY I DON'T LIKE THIS IT'S A FREE MARKET RAMP IT ALWAYS WAS WELL ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT HIS RECORD GOING BACK A LONG WAY SPEED PRETTY EUROSCEPTIC SO WOULD HAVE TO SEE THE REASON THIS MATTERS OF COURSE IS THAT WHO TURNS OUT THE VOTE WILL BE CRITICAL TO WHO ACTUALLY WINS ARE YOU CONFIDENT BELIEVE CAMPAIGN THAT YOU CAN DO
I THINK WE ARE PRETTY CONFIDENT BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT AN APPEAL THAT GOES TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCIES BUT OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT TO DO IS TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE BUT I THINK THEY'VE GOT A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF DOING THIS PARTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FAVOUR OF LEAVE A MUCH MORE MOTIVATED TO VOTE THAN PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STAY IN BUT THEY'RE ALSO MOTIVATED MAN CALLED ARUM BANKS AS YOU KNOW A VERY BIG DOWN A FRIEND OF NIGEL FARAGE NOW SAYS HE'S GOING TO TAKE THE WHOLE THING TO COURT WANTS TO DELAY THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE HE THINKS THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN RUN IN THE BAD WAY
IT DOESN'T SOUND TO ME LIKE YOU CAN EVER QUITE REPAIR THE RIFFS ON YOUR OWN SIDE WELL THERE ARE ALWAYS DIFFICULTIES ABOUT THAT DISH BUT I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET INVOLVED IN LEGAL ENTANGLEMENTS WHICH IS GOING TO DELAY EVERYTHING THERE'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT DECISION TO BE TAKEN OF WHAT WE NOW NEED TO DO IS TO RALLY ROUND YOUR AND GET THE RESULT WE WANT YOU SEE LAST THOUGHT I'VE JUST BEEN LOOKING AT THE HISTORY OF THIS FOR A B.B.C. TWO DOCUMENTARY LOOKING BACK AT NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE LOTS OF VOTERS SAID THEY SIMPLY LOOKED AT THE TYPE OF PEOPLE ON THE SIDE THAT WAS SAYING NO
I DON'T WANT TO CAST ASPERSIONS BUT THEY DID AND THEN THE END THOUGHT YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE ON THEIR SIDE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK THAT SOME ELEMENT OF TRUTH IN AND ALL THAT BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE I WAS THERE I WAS A NATIONAL AGENT FOR THE NO CAMPAIGN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHICH WAS AN ENORMOUS PREPONDERANCE OF MONEY HUGE TEN TO ONE RATIO OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE YES CAMPAIGN ARE SUPPOSED TO DO CAMPAIGN THAT'S READY WHAT TIPPED IT
FORGIVE THE GRATUITOUS BUG JOHN MILLS THANK YOU IMAGINE IT'S ALL NIGHT PLAY DID IT EUROPE THEM OR US TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE NOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BRITISH PEOPLE ARE TO HAVE A FULL BODY M.R.I. SCAN SO THAT A RECORD COULD BE MADE OF THEIR INTERNAL ORGANS IT'LL BE THE WORLD'S LARGEST HEALTH IMAGING STUDY AND HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT FOR THE U.K. BY A BANK AND WE'RE JOINED BY THE MAN OVERSEEING IT PROFESSOR PAUL MATTHEWS FROM IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT FOR DOING THIS AFTER ALL WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SCANS OF PEOPLE'S ORGANS DON'T WE
WELL THIS IS USING THIS IS A NEW STUDY FUNDED BY THE WELLCOME TRUST OF THE M.I.C. WHICH IS TO USE THE MOST SOPHISTICATED THE MOST UP TO DATE METHODS TO STUDY THE BRAIN THE HEART THE BODY THE BLOOD VESSELS AND THE BONES OF PEOPLE WHO'RE ON WHOM THERE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HEALTH DATA COLLECTED AND WHO'LL BE FOLLOWED FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THEY VOLUNTEERED SO GENEROUSLY
TO LET SOCIETY STUDY THEM OH KAY SO THE PARTICULAR NEW THING FROM THIS ISN'T THAT YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER PICTURE OF HER LIVER IT'S THAT YOU'VE GOT A PICTURE OF A LIVER WHEN YOU KNOW THAT PERSON'S D.N.A. AND PLENTY OF OTHER STUFF ABOUT THEM PRECISELY THERE'S ANOTHER ELEMENT TO THAT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE AGREED TO ALLOW THESE IMAGES ALONG WITH THE OTHER DAVID TO BE AVAILABLE TO SCIENTISTS ALL OVER THE WORLD THIS WILL CREATE
AN UNMATCHED RESOURCE FOR A SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY TO FIND NEW TREATMENTS NEW WAYS OF DELAYING THAT ARE STOPPING DISEASE BEFORE IT EVER HAPPENED OH K. SO IT'S AN OPEN PLATFORM AND HIS BIG DATA I SUPPOSE IT IS VERY BIG DID OH KAY HOW DO YOU GO LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WHEN YOU HAVE THAT AMOUNT OF MUCH OF INFORMATION
THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES ONE APPROACH IS TO TAKE TO THIS LARGE DAVIES SET A SPECIFIC QUESTION AND TO LOOK FOR THOSE PEOPLE THOSE PIECES OF DATA THAT CAN HELP ONE BEST ENTERED SO YOU CAN THINK OF THIS HUNDRED THOUSAND AS A SET OF NESTED SMALLER STUDIES
THAT'S IN PART ONE OR TWO A BID THE OTHER APPROACHES TO USE ADVANCED THEY'D ANALYTICS TO HELP THE DAHLIA TELL YOU ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE GUESSED ABOUT PATTERNS IN BRAIN CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE THAT MAY HELP US FIND PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA
OH SO WHAT THEY WILL THEY'LL BE SCANNED ONCE NOT OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT WENT AT PRESENT THE PLAN IS TO SCAN THEM ONCE EXCEPT THAT THE U.K. DIMENSIONS PLATFORM WHICH IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE U.K. BY A BANK
WE'LL BE TAKING TEN THOUSAND OF THESE PEOPLE WHO VOLUNTEERED TO BE SCANNED SERIALLY AND TO TAKE PART IN OTHER RESEARCH STUDIES AS WELL THIS WILL GIVE US A WAY OF FOLLOWING PEOPLE AT LEAST FOR THEM
DEMENTIA RISK ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION IS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE COS IN A WAY IT'S IT'S QUITE BIG IT'S QUITE WOOLLY IS THAT DOES THE NATURE OF THE WAY THIS SORT OF RESEARCH IS AND YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST THAT WITH THIS MUCH INFORMATION YOU WILL START NOTICING PATTERNS PATTERNS WE HADN'T NOTICED BEFORE WELL I DON'T THINK WE WILL HAVE TO TRUST ANY MORE
THE U.K. A BANK OPENED ITS DOORS IT'S DATED THERE ONCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT THE IMAGING DATA LAST YEAR ALREADY THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL PAPERS PUBLISHED THAT HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE ON NEW GENES ASSOCIATED WITH INTELLIGENCE HELPING US TO FIND WAYS OF TREATING DEMENTIA THAT WE HADN'T THOUGHT OF BEFORE
UNDERSTANDING THE RISKS OF LATE LIFE HEART DISEASE INTERESTINGLY FOR YOU PERHAPS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE SPENT SLEEPING AT NIGHT AND THE RISK OF HEART DISEASE AND DEATH
SO THIS IS IT I MEAN COS HE'S ONLY BEEN GOING HOW LONG IS IT BECAUSE I'M NOT GROWN VERY SHORT PERIOD YOU'RE SAYING IT'S ALREADY MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO U.K. BY A BANK HAS BEEN RUNNING SINCE THE EARLY PART OF THIS MILLENNIA ALL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE STUDY HAVE BEEN RECRUITED THE IMAGING PILOT BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SENSED THE PILOT BEGAN ABOUT MID TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN
ALREADY MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STUDIED THE FIRST RELEASE OF DATA CAME LAST OCTOBER SCIENTISTS ARE ALREADY STARTING TO USE THE IMAGING DATA TO MAKE DISCOVERIES IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER DID IT ON THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO THE LAUNCH TODAY IS OF WHAT THOUGH WHAT A LARGE TODAY IS THE BIG LODGE THIS IS THE LAUNCH OF BLUE ROARING BACK THE CURTAINS AND SAY THIS IS DRAWING BACK THE CURTAINS IN THIS IS TO MOVE FROM A SMALL PILOT TOWARDS GEARING UP FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO
PROFESSOR PAUL MATTHEWS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU FOUND YOURSELF PRESENTED ON THE LINE AS A DRUG DEALER OR A PAEDOPHILE WE FOUND THAT SOMEONE POSING AS YOU WERE SENDING EXPLICIT MESSAGES TO CHILDREN THAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE OF NICOLA BROOKS WILL BE SPEAKING TO YOU IN JUST A SECOND SHE'S ONE OF A GROWING NUMBER WHO SUFFER FROM ONLINE ABUSE IT WAS THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER WHICH EARLIER THIS WEEK ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT WHY WOMEN WERE ABANDONED TO THEIR ONLINE ABUSERS FACE IN THE PAPERS THAT HARASSMENT INCLUDING
DEATH THREATS AND RACIST ABUSE WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT CAN FEEL LIKE AND WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT SO AS WELL AS NICOLA WERE JOINED BY THE FORMER CULTURE MINISTER MARIA MILLER IS CAMPAIGNING FOR CHANGES IN THE LAW TO PROTECT PEOPLE LIKE HER THANK YOU FOR JOINING US NICOLA I SUSPECT IS NOT AN EXPENSE IN MANY WAYS YOU WANT TO RELIVE
BUT IF YOU WOULD JUST TELL US HOW EXTRAORDINARILY UPSETTING IT WAS
YEAH GOOD MORNING MY ORDEAL STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN I WAS SINGLED OUT TARGETED ON A. FOR COMMENTING ON A FACEBOOK PAGE FOR AN X. FACTOR
CONTESTANT THE ABUSE ESCALATED VERY QUICKLY WHICH INCLUDED A FAKE CLONE PAEDOPHILE PROFILE MADE OF ME
AND THEY SPREAD IN SHARED MY PROFILE PHOTO MY NAME ALL OVER DIFFERENT FACEBOOK PAGES SAYING I WAS A PROSTITUTE OR DRUG DEALER A PAEDOPHILE AND OBVIOUSLY THE THE OTHER USES THE PUBLIC WERE REACTING TO THIS
THE REPORT SYSTEM DIDN'T WORK AND AFTER ABOUT THE OF WHAT I WAS DOING TO FACE BUT YOU ME YEAH TOOTHPASTE BUT I MYSELF MY FAMILY AND PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME OF THE PEOPLE WE WERE WE ALL CONSTANTLY WERE REPORTING ALL THESE ESCALATING ABUSE TO THE FACEBOOK AND AFTER ABOUT FOUR DAYS I REALISED I NEEDED EXPERT HELP HELP ON THIS
I CONTACTED THE POLICE AND DAY THE LAW FIRM
AND I WAS TOLD TO PRINT OUT ALL THE SCREEN SHOTS WHICH I DID I TOOK OVER TWO HUNDRED SCREEN SHOTS INTO MY LOCAL PLACE AND HOW DO THEY
IT WAS IT WAS AWFUL THEY JUST I WAS IN THERE LESS THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES AND I I TOOK SCREEN SHOTS WITH ME
THEY WOULDN'T LOOK AT IT THEY WOULDN'T LOOK AT ANY OF THE EVIDENCE THEY SAID BECAUSE IT WAS HAPPENED ON FACEBOOK IT WASN'T A POLICE MATTER NO CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND THEY TOLD ME TO CLOSE DOWN MY FACEBOOK
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO SOMEONE AND THEY MIGHT SAY THIS WILL NICOLA DEBBIE HAS TO BE ON FACEBOOK OR YOU COULD CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT COULD YOU UM REOPENING IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO COMMENT IN THIS WAY ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY STRIKING YOU COMMENTING MILLIE ON X. FACTOR IS NOT LIKE YOU TAKE A CONTROVERSIAL POLITICAL DECISION POLITICAL VIEW THAT LED YOU INTO A CONFLICT WITH PEOPLE BUT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO PEOPLE AS A FUN STOP USING FACEBOOK
I THINK EVERYONE'S GOT A RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO USE THE INTERNET AND OPENLY SAFELY WITHOUT FEAR OF OF HARASSMENT OR DREAD HAVE BEEN BOMBARDED WITH ILLEGAL ABUSE FILTH THREATS AND HARASSMENT O.K. I WANT TO BRING MARIA MILLER IN IF I WOULD COME BACK TO YOU I PROMISED MARIA MILLER
FIRST OF ALL HOW COMMON DO YOU THINK MISSUS AND SECONDLY EASY JUST A QUESTION OF CHANGING POLICE ATTITUDES IN THE WAY THAT WE OVER THE YEARS HAD TO DO WEATHER IS BAD DOMESTIC ABUSE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE OR DO YOU THINK IT NEEDS ACTUALLY CHANGE IN THE LAW SO THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INSTANCES LIKE THE ONE WE'VE JUST HEARD ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE NOT JUST PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC EYE BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST
USING TWITTER USING FACEBOOK IN A VERY DAY TODAY MANNER I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THE POLICE FIND IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE LAW WORK AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS AND THAT PUTS A NEED FOR A REVIEW OF THE LAW IN THE WAY THAT WE DID FOR REVENGE PORNOGRAPHY A YEAR AGO AS A RESULT OF CAMPAIGNING THAT I WAS LEADING YOU PUT IN PLACE A NEW LAW THAT PARTICULARLY RECOGNISES THE POSTING OF SEXUAL IMAGES ONLINE IN ORDER TO CAUSE DISTRESS
AND I THINK IF WE CAN HAVE A SET OF LAWS WHICH PARTICULARLY PICK UP ON ONLINE CRIME THAT WILL ENABLE THE POLICE TO DO MORE AND HOW WOULD YOU EVER IN A LAW DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN ROBUST EXCHANGES ON LINE READ MY TWITTER FEED YOU'LL FIND THAT PEOPLE GO IT'S A PRETTY LIVELY THINGS EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK HOW DO YOU DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN A LEGITIMATE PUBLIC DEBATE AND SOMETHING THAT YOU THEN SAY IS HARASSMENT LOOK THE C.P.S. AND THE COURTS DO THAT EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK WHEN IT COMES TO DEFAMATION
OR ANY OF THE OTHER OFFENCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON THE STATUTE BOOKS I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE POLICE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THIS COMPLEX SET OF PROBLEMS BUT WHAT'S MORE WE NEED TO HAVE A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR OPERATORS TO BE OPERATING WITHIN AS WELL BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE ALLOWING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WHETHER IT'S ON FACEBOOK OR TWITTER ON ANY OTHER PLATFORMS TO GO UNCHECKED MIDDLE BOOKS DO YOU THINK THE POLICE THAT YOU DEALT WITH
DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW WE SORT OF THOUGHT WE'VE GOT MORE SERIOUS THINGS FRANKLY TO DEAL WITH OR WAS THERE A SENSE THAT MAYBE THEY WOULD IF ONLY THEY HAD CLARITY ABOUT WHAT THEY COULD DO
NO AT THIS TIME IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE IT WAS DEFINITELY A CASE OF WE DON'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED WITH THIS THIS IS A LOT OF OFFICES BUT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THEY SEEMED THEIR ATTITUDE WAS THAT THEY DON'T CONSIDER IT REAL CRIME
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WAS FACING I COULDN'T GET ANY HELP WHATSOEVER FROM THE PLACE I THINK IT IS CLEAR THAT IT'S REAL CRIME I THINK IN THE TRAINING OF POLICE OFFICERS WE NEED TO PICK THIS UP MORE THOROUGHLY BUT I HAVE TO UNDERLINE THE FACT THAT IT ISN'T JUST THE POLICE FORCE THAT NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION WE NEED TO BE TOUGHER ON TWITTER ON FACEBOOK TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE OPERATING IN A WAY WHICH ENABLES PEOPLE TO REPORT OFFENCES MORE READILY IN THAT ACTION IS REALLY TAPE TAKEN THERE HAVE TO BE CONSEQUENCES AND AT THE MOMENT
THERE AREN'T CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE WHO TAKE THIS SORT OF ACTIVITY ON LINE AND MIDDLE BECAUSE THERE IS A GREAT DEBATE ABOUT FREEDOM OF THE SPEECH INDEED THERE'S A VERY VERY GOOD SERIES ON RADIO FOUR AND ONE FORTY FIVE AT THE MOMENT ABOUT JUST THAT HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THE CONCERN THAT THIS WOULD BE USED NOT BY YOU OF COURSE BUT BY OTHERS TO TRY AND CLOSE DOWN DISCUSSION AND DEBATE THEY DON'T LIKE
THERE IS THERE IS A DEFINITE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FREE SPEECH AND ABUSE AND HARASSMENT IN STALKING ONLINE AS MARIA WAS SAME BEFORE MANY CASES WOULDN'T ACTUALLY NEED POLICE INTERVENTION IF THE NETWORK'S DEALT WITH THE PROBLEM PROPERLY IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY THE ACTIVITY THAT HAPPENS ON THEIR SERVICES IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCE MARIE MILLAR JUST BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD
ARE THOSE NETWORKS TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY NO I DON'T THINK THEY ARE THEY'RE STILL TREATING IT AS THE WILD WEST IT ISN'T THE WILD WEST WE HAVE GREAT FREEDOM SPEECH IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE SHOULD BE STICKING TO THAT MAMA MARIA MILLER AND NICOLA BROOKS JOIN IS FROM BRIAN THANK YOU

SCIENTIST QUICKLY SO THAT NEUTRONS ARE IDEAL FOR FIRING INTO AN ONION TO AND ATOMS NUCLEUS THAT MADE THE NUCLEUS DISINTEGRATE AND RELEASED HUGE AMOUNTS OF ENERGY THE POPULAR TERM WAS SPLITTING THE ATOM AND IT CAPTURED THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION ALL THE MORE SO WHEN IN THE FOLLOWING DECADE IT'LL ADD TO THE ATOMIC BOMB
IN THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS FURTHER STUDY OF A NEUTRON HAS SHOWN ITS APPLICATIONS IN MEDICINE INDUSTRY ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEUTRONS REVEALS FASCINATING DETAILS OF THE ORIGINS OF LIFE OF ALL MATTER OF THE UNIVERSE
WE NEED TO DISCUSS THE NEUTRON ARMOUR NOW GIBSON PROFESSOR OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE AND FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE ANDREW HARRISON CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF DIAMOND LIGHT SOURCE
