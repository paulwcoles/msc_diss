THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED PHIL IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THE DAY'S PAPERS SO DOMINATED BY THE FALL OUT A GRIMLY APPROPRIATE WORD FROM THOSE TERROR ATTACKS IN BELGIUM APPROPRIATE WHY BECAUSE THE TIMES FROM PAGE SAYS THIS BRUSSELS WAS PLOTTING RADIOACTIVE BOMB ATTACK
HE REPORTS THAT ELEVEN BELGIUM NUCLEAR WORKERS ABOUT THEIR WORK PASSES REVOKED AMID FEARS OF BRUSSELS BOMBERS WERE PLOTTING TO BUILD A RADIOLOGICAL DIRTY BOMB DOOMSDAY PLOT IS WHAT THE SUN CALLS IT POINTING OUT THAT A TOP SCIENTIST WAS BEING FILMED BY THE ATTACKERS SECRETLY FILMED BY JIHADIS LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR AUTHORITY ONE OF US STORY AN ANGLE ON THIS THE TELEGRAPH FROM PAGE YOU KAY WAS NOT TOLD ABOUT BOMB FEARS
THAT'S ABOUT THE BOMBS THAT HAPPENED ON TUESDAY NOT ABOUT THE RADIOLOGICAL PLOT SAYING THE PAPERS CLAIMS THAT THIS IS EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE INTELLIGENCE SHARING FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SAYS TWITTER IS TURNING THE WORLD INTO A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE HURL ABUSE QUICKER THAN THEY CAN SPEAK THIS ACCORDING TO THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND'S NEWEST BISHOP THE REVEREND DOCTOR JOAN BAILEY WELLS WHO SAYS SOCIAL MEDIA AND BLOGGING HAVE ENCOURAGED THE RISE OF TRUMP CULTURE IN THE U.S.
SHE DOESN'T WHAT SHE WANTS TO KEEP IT FROM OUR SURE SHE'S PROMISED TO STAND AGAINST THE TENDENCY DRIVEN BY SOCIAL MEDIA TO PASS JUDGEMENT ON OTHERS WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK AND A CATCHY PHOTOGRAPH A SURPRISING PHOTOGRAPH OF DAVID CAMERON ON HIS OWN ON HOLIDAY APPARENTLY APPARENTLY SAM AND THEY DON'T REALLY IS CHEQUE WILL JOIN HIM THERE HE IS WITH A PLATEFUL OF FOOD AT THE BUFFET AT THE FIVE STAR RESORT AND HE'S BEEN CAUGHT BY ANOTHER USER OF THE HOTEL IS POSTED IT ON TWITTER
IT IS NINE MINUTES PAST SIX A LETTER CALLING ON THE CHINESE PRESIDENT TO RESIGN HAS LED TO QUITE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING DETAINED JOHN SON WORK HAS BEIJING CORRESPOND WHAT'S GOING ON
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WITH ANY CERTAINTY THIS WAS A LETTER SUPPOSEDLY ADDRESSED FROM LOYAL COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS ACCUSING THAT PRESIDENT SHE GIN PING OF ALLSORTS OF THINGS OF BUNGLING MAJOR DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC DECISIONS OF TAKING THE COUNTRY IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND CALLING FOR HIM TO RESIGN AT THAT FOR ANYBODY TO HAVE KNOWINGLY PUBLISH SUCH A THING WOULD
TO PUT IT LIGHTLY HAVE BEEN RISKY IN THE EXTREME CHINA HAS A VERY VERY LOW TOLERANCE FOR THIS KIND OF DESCENT SO IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY ITS ORIGINS IS IT GENUINE WAS THE WEBSITE THAT HE'D APPEARED ON POSSIBLY HACKED WHATEVER THE TRUTH IT DOES LOOK AS IF THE AUTHORITIES
ARE TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY WE'VE LEARNED FROM A SOURCE AT THE ON MY MAGAZINE WHERE IT APPEARED THAT SEVENTEEN PEOPLE HAVE NOW BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM A WELL KNOWN CHINESE DISSIDENT A MAN CALLED WHEN YOU AND CHOW WHO LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES IS AN EXILE HE SAYS THAT THREE MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY BACK HOME IN CHINA HAVE ALSO BEEN DETAINED
IN AN ATTEMPT BY THE AUTHORITIES TO PRESSURE HIM BECAUSE THEY SUSPECT HE MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT AND JOHN IT IS IT IS IT PART OF AN ORGANISED CAMPAIGN DO YOU THING TO DO REAL DAMAGE TO PRESIDENT G. OR IS IT GOOD DISSIDENTS WORKING INDEPENDENTLY OF THE WIDER PUBLIC WHAT DO YOU THINK UP
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WE OF COURSE IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE HOLD THESE VIEWS INSIDE CHINA EVEN INSIDE THE COMMUNIST PARTY BUT AT THAT ANY SANE EDITOR WOULD WOULD PUT THIS UP KNOWINGLY SEEMS SO UNLIKELY THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT PERHAPS THIS WAS SOMETHING MALICIOUS FROM OUTSIDE OF CHINA DISSIDENTS ABROAD MAYBE IT WAS JUST SOME DREADFUL SORT OF CAREER ENDING MISTAKE
THAT SAID THOUGH JUSTIN WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER EXAMPLES IN RECENT WEEKS HAVE PEOPLE PUSHING BACK AT SHE JUMPING STYLE OF LEADERSHIP THERE WAS ANOTHER ONLINE MAGAZINE PUBLISHED A PICTURE OF HER OF HER MOUTH TAPED UP WITH MASKING TAPE AS A PROTEST OVER CENSORSHIP HAS BEEN A VERY PROMINENT BUSINESS TYCOON WHO'S BEEN CRITICISING THE PARTY'S MOVES TO TO CLOSED DOWN AND AND TO CENSOR FREE SPEECH
THESE ARE DEBATES AND OFTEN HAPPEN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS THEY THEY SOMETIMES BREAK INTO THE OPEN AND WHATEVER WE MAKE OF THIS LETTER MAYBE WE ARE NOW IN ONE OF THOSE TIMES JOHN SUB WORTH IN BEIJING THANKS IT'S TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX ON A DAY WHEN WE'RE STILL DIGESTING THE HORROR OF WHAT SO CALLED I S. HAVE DONE AND ARE PREPARED TO DO THE FATE OF ANCIENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES IN SERA MAY SEEM A LITTLE
LESS THAN CENTRAL BUT HOPES ARE GROWING THAT THAT ANCIENT SITE OF PALMYRA IN SYRIA MAY SOON BE BACK IN SAFER HANDS YOU MAY RECALL THE TEMPLE I WAS BLOWN UP BY SO CALLED ICE FORCES A YEAR AGO LENA SIN JAB IS OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT PART OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE LENA IS IT A SIGN OF THE PROGRESS THE SUCCESS OF RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES
AT THE S. AND D. THEN IT'S THE TIMING AS YOU RIGHTLY MENTIONED AFTER THE BOMBING IN BRUSSELS AND NOW THE EDGE JULIAN GOVERNMENTAL AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE FIGHTING TERRORISM IN IN SYRIA AND PROBABLY COME OUT OF THIS AS THEIR PARTNER OR FOR PEACE TALKS THAT'S WHAT'S PRESIDENT WANTED TO SEND
AS A MESSAGE ACROSS THE WORLD ESPECIALLY WHEN THEIR PEACE TALKS IN GENEVA A RAPPING FOR THE SECOND ROUND THIS YEAR AND HOW CLOSE ARE THEY TO GOING INTO PALM AND LET'S START WITH HIS MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE WILL COME BACK TO THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL REMAINS IN THE SECOND
WELL SO FAR THE GOVERNMENT'S MEDIA HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAVE ENTERED THE SOUTH WEST OF OF THE CITY WHERE THERE ARE A FEW TOWELS BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN HAVING SWEET CENTRE OF THE HISTORICAL SITES YET AT THE GOVERNMENT'S IS GONE THERE ARE CONTINUING EAR IT'S ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SUCCESSFUL MILITARY OPERATION TO RETAKE BAG AND THE ANCIENT CITY THAT HAS BEEN SEIZED BY US
LAST TO LAST ME THE D.E.A. IS LIKE A MUSCLE HAVE DESTROYED JEWEL WHICH WILL TARGET YOU OLD TEMPLES ALTON HE'S OURS FOR WALKING GLOBAL OUTRAGEOUS WHY BRIEFLY THEN THEY DON'T IS THERE MUCH TO RECOVER ALL THE SIGHTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTEREST BEEN DESTROYED
NEVER WILL THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES CAN GET INDUSTRY ON THE OTHER USED TO ACTUAL TEMPLES THAT MEANS TRIED ALSO THERE IS AND THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT THE OPERATION IT'S TAKING PLACE TODAY IF THE STUDENT DONNA AND RUSS NOT ABLE TO TAKE IT
MAYBE PEOPLE ARE SPOTTED IT'S A QUESTION HOW HAVE YOU MANAGED TO ALLOW A AS IN THE THEY DROVE SEVENTY THOUSAND KILOMETRES TO TAKE SUCH A HISTORICAL SETTEE WHICH WAS A BIG BLOW FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND THE WORLD AS WELL LEAN ASTRINGENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIME FOR THE PAST SIX OUR BIGGEST BANKS ARE FACING YET ANOTHER CHALLENGE THIS TIME THOUGH NOT
FROM THE REGULATORS BECAUSE OF PAST BAD BEHAVIOUR TANYA BECKETT IS HERE TO TELL US WHAT THE CHALLENGES THIS TIME ON TINY GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN JUSTIN WELL THEY'VE BEEN HIT WITH BILLIONS OF POUNDS' WORTH OF FINES AS YOU RIGHTLY POINTED OUT SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF NEW REGULATION AND OF COURSE RECENT STOCKMARKET WOBBLES HAVEN'T BEEN HELPING BUT ARGUABLY THE GREATEST THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF OUR BIG BANKS COMES FROM A WAVE OF FIN TECH FIRMS DOING EVERYTHING FROM PEER TO PEER LENDING TO INTERNATIONAL MONEY TRANSFERS
SO DOES ALL OF THIS NOW POSE AN ESSEX EX EXTENSION OR THREAT TO TRADITIONAL BANKING OR MADE HIS GLOBAL HEAD OF FIN TECH AT K.P.M.G. AND I STARTED BY ASKING HIM WHY RETAIL BANKING SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN INEFFICIENT FROM A COST POINT OF VIEW FOR QUITE SOME TIME
RETAIL BANKING IS RELATIVELY INEFFICIENT INDUSTRY IN PART BECAUSE THE BANKS HAVE HUGE LEGACY I.T. SYSTEMS WHICH ARE HUGELY COMPLICATED
MANY OF THOSE I.T. SYSTEMS ORIGINATE FROM THE EIGHTIES SOMETIMES EVEN AS FAR BACK AS THE SEVENTIES THEY WERE BUILT FOR AN AGE OF FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE AND DIGITAL BANKING THEY WERE BUILT FOR AN AGE WHERE YOU WALKED INTO THE BANK AND HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BANK MANAGER AND IT'S INCREDIBLY HARD FOR THE BANKS TO CHANGE THAT
WHY IS IT SO HARD BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO RE PLATFORM I MEAN CHANGE THE BIG CORE I.T. SYSTEMS WERE BANK THAT'S A PROJECT THAT WOULD TAKE THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND FOR MOST OF THE BIG BANKS WOULD RUN INTO BILLIONS OF POUNDS
AND IT'S NOT CLEAR FOR THE BIG BANKS THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO RIGHT NOW OR CAN THEREFORE THE RISK OF SOMETHING GOING WRONG DURING THAT PROCESS THEY ARE INVESTING IN THE RETAIL BANKS THE BIG U.K. HIGH STREET BANKS SPENT BILLIONS ON THEIR DIGITAL PROGRAMME EACH YEAR AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS REALLY FOCUS ON THE THINGS
THAT INCREMENTALLY DIFFERENT FOR CUSTOMERS SO BUILDING BETTER AND MOBILE APPS BUILDING BETTER WAYS TO AUTHENTICATE CUSTOMERS WHEN THEY DON'T USE HER ONLINE BANKING BUT WHAT THEY'RE NOT DOING IS REPROGRAMMING ALTHOUGH IF YOU LIKE ALL THE PLUMBING ALL THE BACK OFFICE THERE SIX BEHIND BANKING AND THAT'S THE THING THAT REALLY HOLDS THEM BACK
WARREN MADE THEY'RE ONE OF THE BIG BANKS COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE OLD AND CLUNKY THOSE OF THE FIN TECH CHALLENGERS APPEAR TO BE ANYTHING BUT TALBOT HENRY INCAS IS THE CO FOUNDER OF INTERNATIONAL MONETARY TRANSFER SERVICE TRANSFER WHAT EYES I ASKED HIM IF OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY POSES THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR THE BANKS
IT'S DEFINITELY TRUE IS THAT BANKS ARE STUCK WITH SYSTEMS WHICH HAVE BEEN BUILT TO MANY DECADES AGO BUT THERE IS A BIT MORE BEYOND SIS SO ALSO IF WE LOOK AT TO TAKE PLAYERS SO THEY ARE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES SO THEY HAVE NO OFFICE IS TO SUPPORT SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT ONLY HAVING PEOPLE'S THAT HIS COMPANY TO SUPPORT THAT IT'S ABOUT HAVING A DIFFERENT MINDSET WHICH IS MUCH MORE DRIVEN BY CONSUMER NEEDS VERSUS WORDS A BANK CAN MAKE MOST MONEY
AND IT'S ABOUT JUST BEING MUCH FASTER AND NOT HAVING TO GET A LEGACY WHICH KEEP SOME BACK
SO HOW WILL THE BANKING LANDSCAPE LOOK IAN SAY A DECADE SO TODAY ONLY A SORT OF CONSUMERS HAVE A AND NON BANK FINANCIAL SERVICE BUT WE SEE IT IS FLIPPING ON ITS HEAD AND WE'LL SEE CONSUMERS USING NON BANK PROVIDERS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE FINANCIAL NEEDS IN THE FUTURE
WELL THAT WAS TRANSFER WISE SO ONE OF THOSE OTHER NON BANK PROVIDERS IS PEER TO PEER LENDERS OPA NOW THIS ONE TAKES MONEY FROM LANDERS AND PASSES IT DIRECTLY TO BORROW IS THAT ISN'T REALLY THAT DISSIMILAR TO WHAT BANKS ARE DOING WITH CUSTOMER DEPOSITS I ALSO PER'S CO FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN GILES ANDREWS WHAT MAKES HIS COMPANY DIFFERENT
I THINK THERE ARE TWO ANSWERS SO THAT'S AS ONE RATHER BORING REGULATOR ANSWER WHICH IS THAT BANKS ARE REGULATED TO TAKE DEPOSITS AND PROTECT THEIR DEPOSITORS AND HOLD A LOT OF REGULATORY CAPITAL TO DO SO BECAUSE WE CONNECT OUR LENDERS AND BORROWS DIRECTLY WITHOUT USING A BALANCE SHEET WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THAT REGULATORY CAPITAL SO THE PROCESS IS MORE EFFICIENT
I THINK THE MORE INTERESTING ANSWER IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INNOVATE MORE QUICKLY AND USE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES OF THE BANKS TO ALLOW US TO OPERATE THIS PROCESS REALLY REALLY EFFICIENTLY AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
EVEN ABSENT THE REGULATOR IN BURDEN BANK STRUGGLE WITH JUST TELL ME WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ADVANTAGE IS TO THE CUSTOMER IS IT SIMPLY THAT THE RETURNS ARE BETTER OR IS THERE MORE TO IT THAN THAT I THINK I THINK THEY'RE THREE ADVANTAGES SO THE SIMPLE ONE A VALUE SO YES LENDERS GET HAVE A BETTER RETURN THAN THEY MIGHT FROM OTHER INVESTMENT OR SAVINGS PRODUCTS AND BORROWERS GET A BETTER PRICE LIKE THE SECOND POINT IS THAT THE EXPERIENCES BETTER PARTICULARLY FOR A BORROWER SO THE EXPERIENCE OF BORROWING MONEY ON A PLATFORM LIKE SOPER IS EXTRAORDINARILY SLICK AND THE THIRD ONE
PROBABLY RELATES MORE TO THE LENDERS AND THE BORROWERS IT'S A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEIR MONEY TO PROVIDE THE TRANSPARENCY WHICH FRANKLY I THINK WORRIES PEOPLE IN BANKS SO THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE GIVING MONEY TO A BANK BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE BANGERS ON TO DO WITH IT
JOHN'S ANDREAS OF ZO FOR THAT SO HOW ARE THE BIG BANKS RESPONDING TO ALL OF THIS WERE MANY ARE WORKING WITH THE DISRUPTORS IN SOME CASES RATHER THAN AGAINST THEM THEY ALSO TRYING NEW WAYS TO ENGAGE WITH THE CUSTOMER I WENT TO THE SOUTH COAST TO TAKE A LOOK
I'VE COME TO BRIGHTON WHICH IS KNOWN FOR ITS BEACH IT'S PIER AND OF COURSE IT'S CREATIVE COMMUNITY
AND IT'S WHERE BARCLAYS BANK HAS DECIDED TO OPEN ITS DOORS TO ITS THIRD
START UP INCUBATOR AND THIS ONE IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR DIGITAL CREATIVES TO OFFER THEM SUPPORT IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE
MANAGE THIS YES WHAT DOES IT DO WHAT
SO AN EQUAL ABBY IS VERY MUCH A COMMUNITY PROJECT IS OPEN TO ANYONE WITHIN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SO FOR THE BRIGHTON
WE SPACE YOU'VE WALKED INTO NOW IS WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY COME IN AND RUN THEIR BUSINESS SO ALL THE DECKS THAT YOU CAN SEE AROUND YOU
PEOPLE ACTUALLY COME AND USE THIS FOR FLIP BUSINESSES WE THEN ALSO HAVE THIS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY SO SPACE YOU CAN SEE IN FRONT OF YOU WITH THE LARGE T. V.
THIS IS WHERE WE WERE ACTUALLY OFFERING AVAILABLE FOR CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO COME IN AND DO WE CALL CODE PLAYGROUNDS THEY CAN LEARN HOW TO COPE FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE RIGHT WAY THROUGH TWO TEAM TEACH SESSIONS WHERE MAYBE OUT OF MIGHT SLIGHTLY OLDER GENERATION WILL GET HER COMING TO LEARN
HOW TO USE THEIR EYE PADS OR OTHER TABLET DEVICES THEIR LAPTOPS OR SPITEFUL
SO PEOPLE COME HERE TO USE FACILITIES AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE TWO BUT THEY ALSO COME FOR ADVICE ABSOLUTELY SO AND WITHIN EACH OF THE EAGLE LABS WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE NOW I DITCHED A WEEK WHEN I HAVE AND I THINK HE'S OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND WITHIN THE U.K. WHERE WE ARE SUPPORTING PEOPLE UP SKILLING THEM AROUND HOW TO USE LOCAL TECHNOLOGY
I'M NO MEETING JOHN PATTERSON AND YOU'RE STANDING NEXT TO A RATHER MYSTERIOUS LOOKING MACHINE WITH A SORT OF DRAWING
THREE.D. PRINTING
BUT ITS RAPID SAUCE PROTOTYPE AND WE CAN
BRAIN CAN KIND OF THINK OF SO IT HELPS BUSINESSES WHO COME IN JUST GET AN IDEA OF WHAT THE PRODUCT WOULD LOOK LIKE THE COMPLETELY CUTTING DOWN ON THE TIME SPENT SINISTER TO CHINA SELLING STUFF OVERSEAS TO GET ROCKET SAUCE PROTOTYPE IN INTO THE HANDS OF EVERYBODY
THIS IS QUITE EXCITING LOTS OF FLASHING LIGHTS WHAT'S THAT IN THAT'S MOST STRANGE OUT OF THIS IS WOOD I'M GOING TO LASER CUT OUT A PIECE
THIS USES A C.O.TWO LASER LASER STRAIGHT THROUGH
IT'S NOW WHAT WE NEED HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO PROGRAMME SOME OF THESE MACHINES
ALBION
TECHNICAL SIDE OF THINGS IF YOU HAVE GOT THAT IDEA IN FOR IN YOUR HEAD
ALL OF THIS EQUIPMENT IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE THIS IS YOUR WAY OF ENGAGING
I SEE THAT ARE DIFFERENT
IN TIME YOU HAVE TO CHARGE
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT SITE AND THERE IS A CHARGE HOW WAY THAT ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE'VE DONE TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT
SO WITH THE EQUIPMENT YOU SEE NOW WE HAVE A LICKLE FREE FRIDAY
AND ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC YOU CAN COME IN ON A FRIDAY USE THIS EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS FOR THEIR PERSONAL USE
BUSINESS IS ON THE OTHER HAND PAY AS MEMBERS ALL EVERY TIME THEY COME OUT YET THERE IS THERE'S A SMALL MEMBERSHIP FEE BUT ACTUALLY THE WHOLE ETHOS
HE'S NOT ACTUALLY TO MAKE A PROFIT THAT'S NOT OUT
A TOUR ROUND THE EAGLE LAB IN BRIGHTON
KELLY IS HEAD ANALYST AT LONDON CAPITAL GROUP SHE'S WITH ME NOW IN THE STUDIO BANKS ARE UNDER PRESSURE THEY BRENDA THEY CERTAINLY ARE I THINK THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COMPETITION NOW THAT'S STARTING TO RAMP UP BUN WITH THE BANKS ARE REALLY DEALING WITH A LOT OF THE LEGACY PROBLEMS WERE CAUSED BY THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRISIS I'M BY THEMSELVES IN AN OFF THEMSELVES THEY HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE AND THIS IS WHERE THE FIN TECH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN COMING IN
SO I DON'T THINK THE BANKS WILL CEASE TO BE RELEVANT BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION BECAUSE YOU WILL ALWAYS NEED A REGULATED ENTITY BUT FOR SOME OF THOSE SERVICES LIKE FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND MONEY TRANSFERS I THINK SOME OF THESE COMPANIES WILL START TO INFILTRATE THE BANKS AND REALLY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY THERE RIGHT WELL LET'S COME TO THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRON BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN TROUBLING BANK'S LOW INTEREST RATES CAN MAKE IT PRETTY DIFFICULT TO OPERATE AND OBVIOUSLY TURBULENT STOCK MARKETS TO RE EMERGING TALK OF A RATE HIKE IN THE UNITED STATES
WELL I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FOR THE NEXT COMING MONTHS AND CERTAINLY AT THE MOMENT THE MARKET AND A PRICING EARTHING UNTIL REALLY SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE COMING OUT AND MAKING THEIR CASE FOR WHY RATE HIKE SHOULD AND WILL BE IMMINENT AS CERTAINLY WE HAVE SEEN VERY GOOD LABOUR DATA FROM THE U.S. BUT YOU STILL HAVE A STICKY POINT IN REGARDS TO INFLATION OF THE LAC THERE ARE OFF AND I THINK PERHAPS THAT ETHEL M. C. WOULD PREFER GACY INFLATION SLIGHTLY AT A HIGHER
IN AIR BEFORE THE ACTUALLY EMBARK ON AN EVEN GREATER RATE TITLING RATE RATE TIGHTENING CYCLE AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE GLOBAL HEAD WINDS AS WELL WHICH ARE REALLY PREVENTED THE ETHEL M.C. FROM DOING AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE DONE AT THIS POINT IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE NO MORE THAN TWO RATE HIKES THIS YEAR WHEREAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THEY HAD PAINTED IN AROUND FOUR O.K. LET'S COME BACK HOME AND TALK ABOUT NEXT SHARES FELL THE STUNNING FIFTEEN PER CENT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT HAPPENED
I THOUGHT NEXT WAS A VERY INTERESTING STARK AND CERTAINLY OVER THE AFTERMATH OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WAS EXCEPTIONALLY BUSILY HELD ITS OWN VERY WELL ED AND DONE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL QUADRUPLE THAT SHARE PRICE AND NEVER REALLY HAD ANY PROFIT WARNINGS EVEN HER DOWN TO THE WEATHER I NEVER REALLY HEARD THEM MENTION THE WEATHER AS AN ADVERSE SCENARIO IN TERMS OF SALES BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY SAID THAT TWENTY SIXTEEN IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE WALKING UP THE DOWN ESCALATOR WHICH I THINK IS A VERY NEGATIVE ASSESSMENT OF HOW TWENTY SIXTEEN IT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT
BUT YOU HAVE INCREASED COMPETITION IN THIS INDUSTRY THE ONLINE BUSINESS IS REALLY STARTING TO RAMP UP WITH DIFFERENT COMPANIES COMING INTO THE U.K. AND WON'T NEXT MAY HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH ON TOP IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THEY ARE STARTING TO NOTICE A DIFFERENCE PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO THE TECHNOLOGY AND THEIR WEBSITE OR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S OPTIMISED FOR MOBILE SO THEY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BUT I THINK THERE WILL BE O.K.
BRENDA THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED I THINK WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT IT'S LIKE WALKING UP A DOWN ESCALATOR NEXT WEEK AFTER CONSUMING LOTS OF CHOCOLATE THERE SPEAKING OF WHICH WE'RE TALKING TO THE BOSS OF HOTEL SHOOK HONOUR IN AN HOUR'S TIME A TRUST IS BRINGING SOME IN FOR ALL OF US HERE'S OUR TENT MADE HIM PROMISE A TWENTY SECOND BUT IT'S FOR A SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED GARY IS HERE WITH THE SPORT WANNA GO NEXT JUSTIN GOOD MORNING TO YOU IN LAST NIGHT'S INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND DREW ONE ONE WALES EQUALISED FROM THE PENALTY SPOT IN THE EIGHTY NINTH MINUTE THROUGH SIMON CHURCH

SYRIA BUT BUT THAT IS PRETTY MUCH ALL WE KNOW BUT THERE'S NO THERE'S NO SENSE I DON'T THINK THIS IS THIS IS THAT IT DOESN'T FEEL TENSE I DON'T BUT YOU SENSE THAT THIS IS THERE SOMETHING GOING TO HAPPEN I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S PRETTY STATIC NOW THEY'VE GOT THIS MAN AND THEY'D HE'S OBVIOUSLY LED THEM TO THIS PLACE AND THERE'S THERE'S NO FEELING THIS IS ABOUT TO KICK OFF AND ANYWHERE HUGH THANK YOU LET'S TURN TO BRUSSELS AND TO A REPORTER AND A HOLOGRAM WHO'S THERE ARREST AS WELL IN BRUSSELS AND
INDEED I'M OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION BUILDING NO A RAINY MORNING HERE IN BRUSSELS BUT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WORK IT FEELS AS THOUGH ON THE THIRD DAY OF WARNING THINGS ARE STARTING TO RETURN TO MORNING
TO NORMAL OVERNIGHT THOUGH THERE WERE RAISED AGAIN IN THE SKY A BIG DISTRICT OF BRUSSELS HOUSE TO HOUSE SEARCHES RESIDENTS REPORTED HEARING EXPLOSIONS ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY DETAIL ABOUT THE SIX PEOPLE WHO WERE ARRESTED OR WHAT THEY PHONES DURING THE COURSE OF THE SEARCHERS REMEMBER EARLIER THIS WEEK THEY WERE ANTI TERROR RAIDS IN SCAR BAKE THEIR FIFTH FLOOR OF AN APARTMENT BLOCK THERE
AND THE PHONES LIKE STANDARD FLAG THAT'S BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THEY PHONES NAILS AND CHEMICALS THOUGHT AHEAD
PROBABLY BEEN USED TO MAKE A BOMB AND WE'RE HEARING REPORTS OF A NIGHT FROM OUR COLLEAGUES AT A.B.C. NEWS THAT U.S. OFFICIALS U.S. OFFICIALS
CONFIRMED THAT THE ALLEGED BRUSSELS BOMB SUSPECTS THE BROTHERS COLOUREDS AND ABRA HIM ALBA CRYER WE WERE IN A U.S. TERRORISM DATABASE THE THE F.B.I. HAS HASN'T CONFIRMED THAT THEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T CONFIRM THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD IMPEDE THEIR ABILITY TO COUNTER TERRORISM
AND ALSO A SUGGESTION THAT THEY HAD A LONGER TERM TARGET OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES
DO YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES TODAY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED ON AND OFF FOR A LONG TIME IN TERMS OF THIS ARTICLE THEY TALK ABOUT WORKERS THAT THEIR FACILITY HAVING THEIR BADGES ARE REMOVED AND SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE BEING PHONES AT THE HOME OF SOMEBODY WHO WAS LINKED TO THE PARIS ATTACKED SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE
A WORKER AT THE CONNECTED TO THE NUCLEAR PLANTS ALL OF THE SUN CONFIRMED AT THE MOMENT BUT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT BELGIUM SHOULD COULD HAVE DONE MORE TO PREVENT THESE ATTACKS LAST TUESDAY AND ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS SHARING OF NOT JUST THIS SHARING OF INTELLIGENCE BUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW TO GLEAN MORE INFORMATION FROM THE ONE OF THE PRIME SUSPECTS IN THE PARIS ATTACK FELLA AT THE SLAM TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD HE WAS ARRESTED
IN THE MODERN BIG DISTRICTS OF BRUSSELS LAST FRIDAY THEY THEY'VE HAD HIM IN CUSTODY SINCE FRIDAY HE WAS SHOT IN THE LEG HE RECEIVED TREATMENT THEY QUESTIONED HIM ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO ONE ARTICLE THOUGH IN IN POLITICAL THEY ONLY QUESTIONED HIM FOR ONE HOUR AND THEY STARTED IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER SO THEY STARTED WITH THE PARASITISED AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING AHEAD SO WHETHER HE HAD ANY KIND OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ANY OTHER ATTACKS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN IMMINENT SO MANY QUESTIONS
BEING RAISED ABOUT THIS COUNTRY'S ABILITY TO COUNTER TERRORISM AND ALL THIS IS HAPPENING WHAT IS THIS JOHN KERRY PREPARES TO MEET OFFICIALS HERE IN BRUSSELS TODAY ANNA THANK YOU
IT IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW REMEMBER THE BUDGET FIRST THE JOHNSTOWN TO ABANDON THOSE DISABILITY CUTS THEN HE WAS UNABLE TO SAY HOW HE'D FILL THE RESULTING FINANCIAL BLACK HOLE BUT NOW ANOTHER OF HIS BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS IS UNDER ASSAULT FROM HIS OWN SIDE ROSS HAWKINS OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS HERE TO TELL US MORE
WHAT THIS TIME YOU'LL REMEMBER THE CHANCELLOR SAID HE WAS GOING TO FREE SCHOOLS FROM LOCAL EDUCATION BUREAUCRACY BY TURNING ALL STATE SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND INTO ACADEMIES WITH AS A POLITICAL PROBLEM FOR THAT MUCH OF THAT LOCAL EDUCATION BUREAUCRACY ACTUALLY EQUATES TO CONSERVATIVE COUNCILLORS IN CONSERVATIVE SHIRES RUNNING SCHOOLS OR HELPING TO RUN THEM AND SOME OF THOSE FEEL PRETTY STRONGLY I'VE SPOKEN TO SEVERAL
WHO FEAR THAT SMALL SCHOOLS COULD CLOSE MAKING A PRETTY SIMPLE ARGUMENT IF IT AIN'T BROKE WHY ARE YOU GOING TO GO AND FIX IT AND CAUSE DISRUPTION SPEAKING TO EM PEAS OFF THE RECORD
MOSTLY LOYALISTS NOT THE SORT OF PEOPLE WHO COME ON AIR EVERY DAY AND CRITICISE DAVID CAMERON THEY ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE A CASE TO COLLEAGUES AGAINST THIS THEY ARE CONCERNED AND THE THOUGHT IS WERE IT NOT FOR THE ROWS WE'VE HAD ABOUT DISABILITY BENEFIT SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE OF THIS THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION MICKEY MORGAN NEEDS TO TAKE NEW POWERS TO DO THIS SO THEY ANTICIPATE THERE BEING NEW LAW ON WHICH THERE COULD BE A REBELLION OR AT THE VERY LEAST CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE
AND COUNCILLORS ARE SPEAKING ON THE RECORD AND WE JUST PLAY YOU A LITTLE OF MY CONVERSATION WITH MELINDA TILLY WHO'S IN CHARGE OF EDUCATION IN OXFORDSHIRE WHICH MEANS THAT SHE HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOLS IN DAVID CAMERON'S WITNEY CONSTITUENCY VERY MUCH ON THE RECORD IT MEANS A LOT OF LITTLE PRIMARY SCHOOLS WILL BE FORCED TO GO INTO MULTI ACADEMY TRUST
AND I JUST FEEL IT'S THE WRONG TIME IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR A LITTLE PRIMARY SCHOOLS TO BE FORCED INTO DOING THIS AND EMMA I'M AFRAID THERE COULD BE A FEW LITTLE VILLAGE SCHOOLS THAT GET LOST IN ALL OF THIS IN YOU SOUND A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN YOUR GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY PUTTING IT VERY MILDLY HOW WOULD YOU PUT IT
I'M FED UP I'M FED UP WITH DIKTATS FROM ABOVE SAYING YOU WILL DO THIS AND YOU WON'T DO THAT THIS IS NOT WHY I BECAME A CONSERVATIVE
THAT BEGS THE QUESTION ROSS WHY ARE THEY DOING IT HAVE BEEN WHAT IS THE POINT YES UP TILL NOW THEY'VE SAID THE SCHOOL SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO BECOME ACADEMIES SHE CALLS ADDICT OUT IN THE FUTURE THEIR VISION THEIR BIG IDEA IS YOU GET MORE SCHOOLS WORKING TOGETHER IN TRUST SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY SAY CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU HEARD THEIR VILLAGE SCHOOLS WILL BE BETTER PROTECTED YOU MIGHT HAVE FOUR SMALL RURAL PRIMARIES TOGETHER YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE PERSON YOU CAN TEACH FRENCH THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TEACH ACROSS THOSE SCHOOLS MY
VIEW OF THIS MY PERCEPTION OF THIS AT THE MOMENT IS THEY HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO MAKE THAT CASE THE PROBLEM IS THE CASE AGAINST IS ALREADY BEING MADE AND FRANKLY BUT WILL SWING THIS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER HIS PARENTS IF PARENTS START GETTING WORRIED IF THEY START COMPLAINED TO M.P.S IF M.P.S GET ANXIOUS THOSE M.P.S RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE FORTNIGHT WE'VE JUST HAD BELIEVE THEY CAN CHANGE MINISTERS MINES WELL WE WILL GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO MAKE THAT CASE IN QUESTION NICK GIVE THE SCHOOLS MINISTER ON IT AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THANKS ROSS
I'M A TWENTY TO SEVEN THE ISSUE OF TAX DOMINATED LAST NIGHT'S TELEVISED DEBATE BETWEEN THE SCOTTISH PARTY LEADERS IN THE RUN UP OF COURSE THE SCOTTISH ELECTION MAY THE FIFTH BRIAN TAYLOR'S THE B.B.C.'S A SCOTTISH POLITICAL EDITOR AND BRIAN IS IT IS IT CLEAR NOW THEY'VE GOT NEW POWERS ON TAX IS OBVIOUSLY HUGELY IMPORTANT
CLEAR WHAT EACH OF THE PARTIES WOULD DO
PRETTY CLEAR YES THE MANIFEST AS OF COURSE YET TO COME OUT WE KNOW THAT THE THE SITUATION THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIVIDE I THINK UPON THE MIDDLE DIVISION WE HAVE ON THE ONE HAND THE CONSERVATIVES SAYING OH BY THE WAY THAT LEAVE THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVES USUALLY TEMPTED TO OFFER ATTACKS
CUT IN SCOTLAND TO SET HERSELF APART EVEN MORE DISTINCTIVELY BUT SHE SAID AS AS A FALL BACK PEOPLE AND SCOTT WOULD YOU NOT BE A BIT MORE OF THOSE IN ENGLAND LEAVE WELL ALONE LIBERAL AND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IN THE LABOUR PARTY BOTH OFFERING ONE PENNY CUT IT INCREASE ACROSS ALL RATES LABOUR ALSO SAYING INCREASE TO FORTY FIVE PENCE RATE TO FIFTY WHICH BRINGS US TO
THE S.N.P. NICOLA STURGEON TAKING A CAUTIOUS LINE SHE DOESN'T ACCEPT THAT FORTY FIVE POUNDS AND FIFTY PENCE IN GRECIAN FOLK COULD AVOID IT SIMPLY BY SHIFTING THEIR THEIR TAX AFFAIRS OUT OF SCOTLAND AND SHE IS AGAINST THE ONE PER CENT OVERALL INCREASE SHE SAYS AT THAT WE SHOULD BE TRANSFERRING WHAT SHE CALLS TORY AUSTERITY ON TO THE BACKS OF THE POOR IN SCOTT BUT THOSE DIVISIONS CAME TO A HEAD
VERY SHARPLY INDEED IN LAST NIGHT'S EXCHANGE AND ON THE HIGHER RATE THEM THAT THAT'S A NO FOR EVER IS IT THE NO FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF THE S.N.P. THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY EMERGED EVEN WASHED STOP YOUR LAST NIGHT IT WAS STARTING WHEN SHE PRODUCED THE TAX POLICY EARLIER THIS WEEK SAID SHE WAS SAYING NO FOR NOW ON THE GROUNDS THAT SHE WAS ADVISED BY CIVIL SERVANTS BECAUSE IT WAS A SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT STAGE RATHER THAN A PARTY WANT TO REVISE MY CIVIL SERVANTS
WITH THAT FOLK IT WAS IT WAS ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND FELL INTO THAT BRACKET THOSE ADDING OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND QUID A YEAR AND SHE SAID THAT THEY COULD THEY COULD ORDER THERE ARE FEARS SUCH THAT THEY WOULD NOT FACE THAT SCOTTISH IN POSITION SIMPLY BY SHIFTING THAT ACCOUNTS OR WHATEVER SO SOUTH OF THE BORDER SHE SAID WILL BE SEVEN PER CENT DID SO SCOTT IT WOULD END UP LOSING REVENUE FROM THAT INCREASING TAX ALSO I THINK IT'S ABOUT A SIGNAL YOU EITHER WANT TO ON THE ONE HAND SHE WANTS YESTERDAY
LET'S BRING IN REVENUE BUT SHE STILL WAS A SIGNAL THAT SCOTLAND IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS SO SHE'S ELEGANT LAST NIGHT SHE WAS RIGHT ABOUT FOR ONE YEAR UNTIL THEY COULD PERHAPS FIND WAYS OF PLUGGING THE LOOPHOLES THAT WOULD THAT WOULD MEAN FOG COULD SHIFT TACK SHE GOT SHE GOT UP OR PELTING ON THAT FRANKLY FROM FROM LABOUR LAST NIGHT WHICH IS LA GRANDE VERY FIRMLY THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS OVERWHELMING GESTURES AND SOUNDING MACHO BUT IT ACTUALLY ENDED UP COSTING SCOTLAND MONEY THERE WAS NO POINT
THANKS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS GENOCIDAL BUTCHER IS HOW THE INDEPENDENT DESCRIBED THE FORMER BOSNIAN SERB LEADER RAAVAN CARROT IT SHE WAS SENTENCE FOR GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY YESTERDAY MANY OF THE PAPERS PRAISED THE WORK OF THE COURT AT THE HAGUE THE TRIED HIM WHILST ALSO REFLECTING ON THE DEEP ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS DIVISIONS THAT CONTINUE TO PLAY THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA THE INDEPENDENT SAYS HE'S SENSING WAS GREETED WITH BOOS AND JEERS AT A RALLY OF ULTRA NATIONALIST IN BELGRADE
ANIMAL IS THE SINGLE WORD HEADLINE THE FRONT OF THE SUN DETAILS WHAT IT CALLS THE VILE SEXUAL DEPRAVITY OF THEIR FORMER SUNDERLAND FOOTBALLER ADAM JOHNSON AND ITS EDITORIAL THE MIRROR SAYS THE CASE ARE SHOWN THE UGLY SIDE OF THE GAME THAT'S RAPIDLY LOSING ITS BEAUTIFUL IMAGE FOOTBALL CLUB SAYS THE PAPER HAVE A DUTY TO TEACH SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO THEIR PLAYERS ARE ALL TOO OFTEN EMOTIONALLY MATURE ARROGANT FIGURES WITH HUGE EGOS
IT'S FRONT PAGE THE MAIL SAYS THE OFFENCES WERE BEYOND THE PALE BUT GOES ON TO ASK IF SIX YEARS WAS REALLY THE RIGHT SENTENCE THE TELEGRAPH CARRIES CLAIMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON N.H.S. TRUSTS
TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY REPORT THEIR FINANCES IN WHAT IT SAYS IS A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE LOOMING DEFICIT THE PAPER SAYS IT SEEM BRIEFING DOCUMENT SUGGESTING THE MINISTERS ARE ENCOURAGING TRUST TO BE MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR ACCOUNTS ONE CRITIC FROM THE NUFFIELD TRUST THINK TANK TELLS THE PAPER THE SUGGESTIONS DEFINITELY FALL INTO THE AREA OF FIDDLES
SO THEY CARRIED OUT BY THE TIMES AS FIND THAT ONLY TEN PER CENT OF PEOPLE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONER OPERATING IN THEIR AREA THIRTY FOUR PER CENT OF PEOPLE QUESTIONED THE POLE HAD NO IDEA THEY'D HAD A COMMISSIONER THE PAPER SAYS THE FINDINGS WILL COME AS A BLOW TO THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY IS LOOKING AT EXPANDING THE ROLE OF THOSE COMMISSIONS THE SKETCH WRITERS TAKE A SWIPE AT GEORGE OSBORNE'S APPEARANCE BEFORE THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE YESTERDAY FOR THE TELEGRAPH MICHAEL DEACON
HIS RESPONSE TO QUESTIONING ABOUT WHETHER THERE WILL BE FURTHER CUTS TO THE WELFARE BUDGET WAS A MASTER CLASS IN VERBAL EVASIVENESS THE CHANCELLOR'S INSISTENCE THAT THERE WERE NO PLANS FOR SUCH CUTS WAS HE SAID PERFECTLY CLEAR IN ITS VAGUENESS TOM PECK IN THE INDEPENDENT SIX TO REASSURE BENEFIT CLAIMANTS THAT THEIR MONEY IS SAFE PANIC YE NOT HE SAYS I HAVE NO PLANS TO GO ON HOLIDAY IN TWENTY TWENTY BUT IF THERE ARE NO CURRENT PLANS IT JUST CAN'T HAPPEN
THE TIME IS SEVEN THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING POLICE IN BRUSSELS INVESTIGATING TUESDAY'S BOMB ATTACKS HAD MADE SIX ARRESTS AND THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES SAY THEY FILED A TERROR PLOT AND MADE ONE ARREST MORE NOW ON GEORGE OSBORNE'S APPEARANCE BEFORE THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE YESTERDAY TO DEFEND HIS BUDGET AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE WELFARE CUTS JON'S ALSO SAID HE LAUNCHED A ROBUST DEFENCE OF THE SUGAR TAX ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET IF IT WERE TO BE CHALLENGED IN COURT BY THE MANUFACTURERS HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HERE
WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE BUDGET GOT RATHER OVERSHADOWED BY THE UPROAR OVER ALL THE U. TURNS IN THE CABINET RESIGNATION SO WHEN THE CHANCELLOR APPEARED BEFORE M.P.S ON THE TREASURY COMMITTEE ARE KINDLY CONSERVATIVE CHRIS PHILP GAVE GEORGE OSBORNE THE CHANCE TO BE TOUGH BUT CARING HE ASKED ABOUT THAT SUGAR TAX ON FIZZY DRINKS
THERE'S BEEN SOME PRESS SPECULATION PROMPTED I THINK BY SOME OF THE MANUFACTURERS EITHER THEY MIGHT THEY MIGHT MOUNT A LEGAL CHALLENGE OR THAT THEY THEY'RE URGING THE GOVERNMENT TO RETHINK
NOW THE CHANCELLOR USED TO BE MUCH MORE CURVACEOUS UNTIL REPORTEDLY HE TOOK UP THE FIVE TWO DIET A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND ACHIEVED HIS NEW SLIMLINE LOOK HE'S NOW FIRED WITH THE ZEAL OF THE CONVERT I WOULD SAY IF THEY WANT TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE SUGAR TAX BRING IT
WE ARE GOING TO INTRODUCE A SUGAR TAX THAT'S NOT A THREAT OR A PROMISE IS THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE AND I THINK IT IS THE RIGHT THING FOR THIS COUNTRY I THINK IT WILL MAKE A HUGE IMPROVEMENT TO CHILDHOOD
HEALTH THE TAX WOULD HE SAID BE INTRODUCED FOR HIGH SUGAR DRINKS FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND HE'S INTRODUCED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN PRECISELY SO THE COMPANIES HAVE TWO YEARS TO RE FORMULATE THEIR PRODUCTS ALL CHANGE
MARKETING MIX IF THEY WISH TO DO SO OTHERWISE THEY WILL PAY THE TAX CUTS SIR ANY LEGAL CHALLENGE WILL BE ROBUSTLY DEFENDED BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT WE FIRST SCHOOL TOOK LEGAL ADVICE BEFORE INTRODUCING IT
VERY CLEAR IT'S LEGAL AND HE HAD SOME ADVICE FOR ANY SWEET DRINKS COMPANY CONSULTING THEIR LEARNED FRIENDS DON'T WASTE TIME AND MONEY ON LEGAL CHALLENGE USE YOUR USE THIS PERIOD TO LOOK AT YOUR PRODUCTS AND SEE IF YOU CAN RE FORMULATE
BUT LABOUR'S WEST IN WANTED TO TAKE HIM BACK TO THE BITTER EXPERIENCE OF HIS FORCE BUDGET U. TURNS MY TREATING A FAN OF THE CHILDREN'S T.V. SHOW RAINBOW RECALLED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD ONCE KEPT CALLING THE CHANCELLOR
GEOFFREY THIS IS NOT BEEN I THINK ANY WHAT EVERYONE WOULD ACCEPT A HAPPY PROCESS AND THERE'S PROBABLY A RISK THAT WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA VISITS NEXT MONTH YOU THINK YOU'VE CHANGED HER NAME FROM GEOFFREY TO BUNGLE
GEORGE OSBORNE DIDN'T SMILE WHERE'S STREET ING WENT ON I JUST WONDER WHAT LESSONS YOU ARE TAKING AWAY FROM THIS BUDGET BUDGET BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS YOU WENT THROUGH ALSO THE CONTE
THE CHANCELLOR POINTED TO WHAT THE BUDGET HER DONE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE HEALTH AND EDUCATION BUT MEASURES TO LIFT THE LOWER INCOME PEOPLE OUT OF TAX
TO DELIVER A MANIFESTO PROMISES I'M VERY PROUD OF ALL THOSE MEASURES MIND YOU CLEARLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE REFORMS TO DISABILITY BENEFITS WE NEED TO GO ABOUT IT IN A BETTER WAY THAN WE DID
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW IS WHAT EXACTLY HAD GONE ON BEFORE IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAD STOMPED OUT OF THE CABINET WHERE'S STREET SIMPLY COULDN'T WAIT FOR THE MEMOIRS OF WHAT POINT DID IAIN DUNCAN SMITH
FIRST RAISED CONCERNS WITH YOU ABOUT YOUR PROPOSALS FOR PERSON DEPENDS PLAYING WELL I DON'T WANT TO
GET HIM TO AND I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO YOU MAY ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS I HAD IT IN
THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING FOR ONLOOKERS BUT LABOUR'S RACHEL REEVES HAD ANOTHER GIRL WAS THERE A DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THE RESPONSE WAS BEFORE OR AFTER THE BUDGET BUT AS I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO DISAPPOINT A GRITTY I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS I THINK
THIS WAS GETTING FAMILIAR THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR ANDREW TYREE TRY TO QUOTING IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HE MAKES QUITE A SERIOUS ALLEGATION
BUT I DO THINK GENERALLY THERE NEEDS TO BE A GREATER KIND OF COLLEGIATE SENSE TO THE WAY DECISIONS
WOULD THE CHANCELLOR LET IT ALL OUT I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE PRIVATE
SO THAT'S A NO ALL WEAK OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE ALSO BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE CHANCELLOR PLANS TO DO TO FILL THE HOLE IN THE BUDGET CREATED BY THE CHANGE OF HEART ON DISABILITY BENEFITS THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID THERE ARE NO PLANS TO CUT THE WELFARE FURTHER BUT OLD HANDS KNOW THAT NO PLANS IN THE POLITICAL WORLD ISN'T ALWAYS QUITE THE SAME AS WILL NOT RACHEL REEVES PROD IT AWAY
IS IT POSSIBLE CHANCELLOR THAT YOU MIGHT MAKE FURTHER CUTS TO WELFARE SPENDING BUT AS I'VE SAID WE'VE GOT NO PLANS TO MAKE THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION I ASKED CHANCELLOR I COS I'VE SAID WE'VE GOT NO NUMBER TOSSING THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION I I'VE GIVEN YOU A VERY CLEAR ANSWER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REPLACE THE ONE BILLION POUNDS OR JUST OVER ONE BILLION POUNDS MORE THAN WE'RE GOING TO BE SPINNING ON DISABILITY BENEFITS
WITH SOME OTHER CASTAWAY
RACHEL REEVES STILL RECKONED HE'D LEFT HIMSELF SOME WRIGGLE ROOM SO IT ISN'T POSSIBLE AT THE AUTUMN STATEMENT ALONE FURTHER CUTS AS A SAVIOUR TO WEALTH AS ARE NO PLANS FOR THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION I THINK YES BUT IS IT IT'S THE ANSWER I'M GIVING AND SHE HAD TO MAKE DO WITH THAT
SOUNDS FAMILIAR BIRD THAT WAS ASKED IN PARLIAMENT SUSAN HUME WAS REPORTING FOR US AND IF YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE YOU CAN TUNE TO RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE HANDEDLY DIGITAL RADIO AS WELL JUST AFTER HALF PAST IT'S TEN TO SEVEN TEN TO SEVEN AND A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS WORKING WITH A GENETICIST CRAIG VENTER
HAVE MANAGED TO CREATE A MINIMAL CELL WHICH IS A CELLAR CONTAINS ONLY THE GENES NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN LIFE THEIR WORK IS WRITTEN UP IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE HAS CAUSED QUITE A STIR IN THE AREA OF SCIENCE THAT FOCUSES ON THIS ASPECT OF BIOLOGY PROFESSOR PAUL FREEMONT IS CO DIRECTOR OF THE SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY HUB AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON AND IT'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD ONE WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT THEY'VE DONE
WHEN IT REALLY MATTERS BECAUSE WHAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY ACHIEVED HIS THEY'VE SHOWN THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE ESSENTIALLY THE GENETIC INSTRUCTIONS SENSE OF AN ORGANISM AND YOU CAN COME TO MINIMISE THAT TO THE SORT OF MINIMAL SET OF CHAINS WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING BIOLOGICALLY BUT THEN WHAT THEY'VE ALSO MANAGED TO DO IS DEVELOP A SORT OF A PROCESS OF HOW YOU DO THAT IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY SO THEY'VE ACTUALLY MADE A LIST D.N.A. SYNTHETICALLY AND THEY PUT IT TOGETHER IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO TEST WHICH TEAMS ARE NECESSARY FOR LIFE AND WHICH AREN'T AND THEN CONSTRUCTED THE WHOLE GENOME
AND PUT IT IN A CELL AND GET IT TO WORK AND DO THEY KNOW WHY THESE JEANS ARE NECESSARY AND WHY THE ONES THEY'VE GOT RID OF AUNT NO THAT THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT IT THEY'VE ACTUALLY GOT THIS MINIMAL CELL WHICH HE'S GOT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED WHAT'S GOT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE CHAINS IN AND THEY'VE GOT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED ODD THEY DOESN'T THAT'S THE ANSWER IS FOREIGN SEVENTY THREE THERE FOUR AND SENT TO HAVE LIFE WEALTH FOR THIS PARTICULAR SALE AND AT THEY SAID THEY TODAY
SO IT'S FOUR SEVENTY THREE CHAINS THEY KNOW IT'S NEARLY HALF THE REDUCED IF YOU LIKE OF WHAT OF THE ORGANISM THEY STARTED WORTH WHICH WAS AGAIN A SYNTHETIC ORGANISM BUT DO THEY KNOW WHAT EACH OF THOSE FONDANT SEVENTY THREE GENES NO THERE'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THEY HAVEN'T QUITE WORKED OUT YET WHICH INCH IT WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT SHOWS A KNOWLEDGE BASIS SO LACKING WITH THE MOST SIMPLEST ORGANISATION THAT'S FASCINATING OF THE DEEPEST BIOLOGY WHICH WHICH IS THAT HE'S SO STUDDED AND SO CHANGED I SUPPOSE AS A SUBJECT IN THE LAST FEW DECADES BUT WE'RE STILL NOT REALLY IT'S A REALLY EXTRAORDINARY SORT OF THING TO THINK THAT HERE WE ARE IN THIS TIME I'M NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THESE VERY ESSENTIAL GENES ARE BUT
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THIS IS A SPECIFIC ORGANISM THAT HAS A SPECIFIC LIFESTYLE AND OF COURSE THE ONE HUNDRED THOSE GENES FOR THAT ORGANISM MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THE SAME GENES WE NEED FOUR FOR ANOTHER ORGANISM COULD BIOLOGY AS COMPLEX AS YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T GOT IT GOT IT GOING THERE WHAT WHAT DO THEY INTEND TO DO WITH IT WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE DONE WITH IT MAY COULD YOU USE IT
TO TO CREATE OTHER THINGS THAT THE IDEA I THINK THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THERE'S TWO DRIVERS ONE IS THAT FUNDAMENTAL BIOLOGY WHICH WE JUST TALKED AND THE OTHER ONE IS TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE USE CELLS TO MANUFACTURE THINK SO THERE'S THIS WHOLE NEW SORT OF DEVELOPMENTS ARE CALLED SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY AND IT'S SURROUND BY A MANUFACTURING SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE ACTUALLY USE THE CELLS AND WE MAKE CHEMICALS OR WE MAKE DRUGS SO WE MAKE PHARMACEUTICALS OR EVEN ENERGY DIESEL FUEL OR WHATEVER
BUT WE USE THESE KIND OF CELLS HAS SORT OF WHAT THEY CALL CHASSIS IF YOU LIKE LIVING HOST CELLS AND THEN WE CAN SORT OF BUILD NEW GENETIC PROGRAMMES WHICH WE CAN PUT IN THOSE CELLS TO MANUFACTURE THESE COMPONENTS THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THIS WHOLE TECHNOLOGY IS LEADING TO
FASCINATING PROFESSOR PAUL FREEMONT FROM IMPERIAL COLLEGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN GUILTY OF GENOCIDE GUILTY OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY RELEVANT CARE DITCH THE FORMER BOSNIAN SERB LEADER SPENT HIS FIRST NIGHT IN PRISON LAST NIGHT AFTER BEING SENTENCED TO FORTY YEARS BY THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL THE B.B.C.'S ALAN LITTLE IS IN HATE JUST BEFORE WE HEAR FROM HIM HE'S A REMINDER OF ONE OF HIS REPORTS FROM SARAJEVO IN FEBRUARY NINETY FOUR
EVEN IN THE CITY AND EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME NO ONE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED A SINGLE EXPLOSION COULD TAKE SO MUCH LIFE BUT IT WAS THE WORST POSSIBLE PLACE AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME A CITY CENTRE MARKET AND IT'S MIDDAY BUSIEST AND IN AN INSTANT IT BECAME A HUMAN ABATTOIR
GABLE HAD THOUGHT ITSELF UNSHOCKABLE BUT NO ONE WAS READY FOR THIS EVEN HERE EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME THERE ARE NEW DEPTHS TO WHICH TO SING
A HUMAN ABATTOIR A VERY POWERFUL REMINDER OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE MORNING TO YOU ALAN THIS WAS WIDELY CELEBRATED THIS SENTENCE BUT NOT AMONGST BOSNIAN SERBS
MORNING NICK NO INDEED AND IT'S VERY CLEAR ILLUSTRATION OF HOW THE WALL DIVIDED BOSNIA
ETHNICALLY AND HOW THERE ARE TWO PARALLEL NARRATIVES TO PARALLEL TRUTHS ABOUT THE WAR WHICH SIMPLY NEVER CONVERGE IT REMAINS A VERY DIVIDED COUNTRY
RAAVAN CARRIAGE IT'S REMAINS A HEROIC FIGURE ON THE BOSNIAN SERB SIDE JUST THE OTHER DAY
MISTER DORIC THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE POP THE BOSNIAN SERB ENTITY RIPPLE BECAUSE UP TO GO WHICH WAS CREATED DURING THE WAR UNVEILED A STUDENT DROP DORMITORY NAMED AFTER RAAVAN CARICATURE OBVIOUSLY
CLEARLY TIMED TO COINCIDE WITH THE THE VERDICT WHICH WING WE HAVE KNOWN FOR MANY MONTHS WHAT WAS DUE
YESTERDAY SO THAT THEY STILL INSIST
CHARACTERS AS A VICTIM THAT HE'S IS NOT GUILTY OF THE CRIMES THAT HE'S BEEN CHARGED AND THAT THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL
HE'S RIGGED AGAINST THE SERBS THAT DENIAL WILL BE FUELLED PRESUMABLY BY HIS DECISION TO APPEAL AT THE END OF IT
YES IT'S AN INTERESTING DECISION DON'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OF THESE VERDICTS MIGHT BE OVERTURNED THERE IS PRECEDENT FOR THIS
ONE OF HIS CLOSEST LIEUTENANTS MUM SHE LOOK IT WAS THE SPEAKER BOSNIAN BOSNIANS
WAS FOUND GUILTY HERE ABOUT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN YEARS
OF EXTERMINATION THEY DIDN'T PICK THE CHARGE OF GENOCIDE ON HIM
NOT GUILTY OF THAT BUT HE WAS FOUND GUILTY IN THE TRIAL
EXTERMINATION AND SENTENCED TO TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AND ON APPEAL
THE EXTERMINATION CHARGE WAS OVERTURNED AND HE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF OTHER CRIMES INCLUDING PERSECUTION AND FORCED DEPORTATION
BUT HIS SENTENCE WAS REDUCED TO TWENTY YEARS SO IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT RAAVAN CARRIAGE
SENTENCE MIGHT TEAR CHANGIN ON APPEAL ESPECIALLY THAT CONTROVERSIAL GENOCIDE
IT BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD ALAN OR SOMEBODY CARES PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE AREA DOES THIS MEAN WE HAVE PEACE IN THE REGION BUT NOT REALLY RECKONS
YOU HAVE AN ABSENCE OF WARD NICK I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE SAME THING AS PEACE THERE CERTAINLY NO RECONCILIATION IT'S A DIVIDED SOCIETY IT WAS DIVIDED BY THE DAYTON PEACE AGREEMENT WHICH ENDED THE WAR AND BOSNIA IN MY VIEW IS AS CLOSE TO A FAILED STATE AS WE HAVE IN YOURS
THERE ARE TWO MILLION MUSLIMS LIVING IN POVERTY WHO FEEL THE WAR WAS VERY MUCH DIRECTED AGAINST THEM
AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS LEGACY TO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR TALKING TO US THREE MINUTES PHILIP AVERY HAS THE WEATHER FOR US MORNING LEATHER JUSTIN VERY GOOD MORNING TO DECENT DAY TO START OFF THE EASTER PERIOD BUT FROM HERE ON IN IT GOES DOWNHILL PRETTY RAPIDLY AND IN THAT GOES RIGHT THROUGH TO EASTER MONDAY

AS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND A DRY ENOUGH STARTS THE DAY HERE TOO A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE AROUND BUT I THINK THE CLOUD WILL FILL IN FROM THE WEST PRIMARILY AND THE BREEZE WILL FRESHEN UP FROM THE SOUTH AN APPROACHING WEATHER FRONT MAY WELL SPREAD A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN INTO THE FAR WEST OF NORTHERN IRELAND TO FINISH OFF YOUR AFTERNOON AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A TOPS HERE OF AROUND ABOUT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN SO NOT A BAD DAY OVERALL
AND FINALLY TO SCOTLAND FOR THE DAY WITH US SOME SHOWERS PRETTY HEFTY ONES ACROSS THE VERY FAR NORTH THE MAINLAND AND THE NORTHERN ISLES AT THE MOMENT THESE WILL QUIT THE SCENE IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE HOURS OR SO AND THEN THERE'S A LOT OF DRY WEATHER TO BE HAD UNTIL SAME WEATHER FRONT CREEPS IN FROM THE ATLANTIC TO REALLY FRESHEN UP THE WIND ACROSS THE NORTH WESTERN QUARTER OF SCOTLAND AND THERE'LL BE RAIN BEFORE THE DAY IS OUT BUT ELSEWHERE ACROSS SCOTLAND IT SHOULD STAY DRY AND FINE ENOUGH TOP TEMPERATURE IN THE EAST OF TWELVE AS SAY MAKE THE MOST OF IT TOMORROW WET AND WINDY FAIR SPREADING FROM

THE ARRESTS IN THE SKY A BIG DISTRICT FOLLOWS HOUSE TO HOUSE SEARCHES RESIDENTS SAID THEY HEARD EXPLOSIONS DURING THE RAIDS BUT THE CAUSE WAS UNCLEAR THE F.B.I. HAS REFUSED TO CONFIRM WHETHER IT WERE HIM A CRY WE WHO CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK AT THE AIRPORT AND HIS BROTHER KHALID RESPONSIBLE FOR THE METRO BOMBING WERE KNOWN TO U.S. AUTHORITIES SAYING DISCLOSURE WOULD IMPAIR THE GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE AND COUNTERACT TERRORISM
JOHN KERRY'S VISIT COMES AT A TIME OF CONSTERNATION WITH MANY QUESTIONING EUROPE'S COMPETENCE ON COUNTER TERRORISM BELGIUM HAS LOWER STATE OF ALERT TO THE SECOND HIGHEST LEVEL AND YES THE THIRD SUSPECTED AIRPORT ATTACKER HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED AND HE'S ON THE RUN AND THERE ARE REPORTS OF A SECOND SUSPECT BEING SOUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH THE METRO BOMBING STOKING PEOPLE'S WORST FEARS THEY COULD BE PLANNING TO STRIKE AGAIN
FRANCE SAYS IT'S FOILED A TERROR PLANT THAT WAS AT AN ADVANCED STAGE POLICE HAVE ARRESTED ONE FRENCH NATIONAL AND RAIDED A BLOCK OF FLATS AND PARIS THE INTERIOR MINISTER BEAR MUG HAS A NERVE SO THERE WERE NO LINKS AT THIS STAGE BETWEEN THE PLOT AND THE ATTACKS AGAINST BRUSSELS THIS WEEK OR PARIS LAST NOVEMBER

SEVERAL SENIOR CONSERVATIVE COUNCILLORS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN TO TURN EVERY STATE SCHOOL IN ENGLAND INTO AN ACADEMY THE CABINET MEMBER FOR EDUCATION IN OXFORDSHIRE WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR SCHOOLS AND DAVID CAMERON'S CONSTITUENCY SAID SHE WAS FED UP WITH DIKTATS FROM ABOVE
HAMPSHIRE'S EXECUTIVE MEMBER FOR EDUCATION SO THE POLICY WOULD BE RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE AND COULD CAUSE A DROP IN STANDARDS
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WANT SCHOOLS TO BE FREE FROM LOCAL EDUCATION BUREAUCRACY HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS IN HIS BUDGET THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO COMMIT EVERY ENGLISH SCHOOL TO BECOME AN ACADEMY WITHIN SIX YEARS AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WOULD REQUIRE MANY THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY WERE RUN AND FUNDED SOME CONSERVATIVE COUNCILLORS SET TO LOSE INFLUENCE OVER THEIR LOCAL SCHOOLS ON THE POLICY ABANDONED
THE OXFORDSHIRE COUNTS THE MELINDA TILL THE ONE THAT SMALL VILLAGE PRIMARIES COULD BE AT RISK BECAUSE ACADEMY CHAINS MIGHT DECIDE THEY WERE UNVIABLE SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EDUCATION IN THE COUNTY WHICH INCLUDES DAVID CAMERON'S WITNEY CONSTITUENCY
SPEAKING TO THIS PROGRAMME SENIOR TORY COUNCILLORS IN KENT HAMPSHIRE AND TRAFFORD HAVE ALSO QUESTION THE POLICY AT WESTMINSTER SOME CONSERVATIVE M.P.S PRIVATELY FOR NOW OPPOSE THE CHANGE

THE N. A. S. U. W. T. SUGGESTED MANY OF THE CASES COULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED HERE'S OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT THE BIGGEST PAYMENT OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND WAS MADE TO A TEACHER IN LONDON WHO SUFFERED A SLIPPED DISC AFTER BEING ASSAULTED BY PUPILS TWICE IN ONE WEEK
A TEACHER IN NORTH WALES GOT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AFTER HE BANGED HIS HEAD ON THE CONCRETE FLOOR AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THREE BOATS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM HIS CHAIR THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS SAID MOST OF THE CASES IT DEALT WITH INCLUDED CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR THEY WERE ALSO PAYMENTS FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY THE N.U.T.

THEY CLASHED OVER TAX POLICIES THREE OF THE PARTIES LABOUR THE LIB DEMS AND THE GREENS OR WANT TO INCREASE TAX RATES SCOTTISH LABOUR LEADER KEZIA DUGDALE SAID A PENNY ON THE BASIC RATE WAS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP TORY CUTS
THE S.N.P. LEADER NICOLA STURGEON SAYS SHE WOULD REVERSE THE PLAN TAX CUT FOR HIGHER RATE PAYERS BUT WOULD NOT INCREASE THE TOP RATE TO FIFTY P. WHILE THE SCOTTISH TORIES AND UKIP SAY RAISING TAXES COULD DAMAGE THE SCOTTISH ECONOMY
BUTCHERS AND SCOTLAND NOW HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY ARE PREPARED TO PAY MORE TAX RETURN FOR THE PROMISE OF BETTER PUBLIC SERVICES
AT LEAST TWENTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND CHINA FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF HER LETTER CALLING ON THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT SHE GIN PING TO RESIGN FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY THE LETTER WAS POSTED EARLIER THIS MONTH HONEST IT BACKED ONLINE NEW SERVICE BEFORE BEING QUICKLY DELETED BY THE AUTHORITIES

THANK YOU THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE'VE BEEN MORE ARRESTS AS WE HEAD OVERNIGHT IN BRUSSELS AND THE BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER HAS ALSO BEEN TRYING TO STEADY THE POLITICAL SHIP TO MINISTERS OFFERED TO RESIGN OVER THE SECURITY FAILURES IN THE MONTHS BEFORE THE SUICIDE ATTACKS WITH THE PRIME MINISTER'S TELL THEM TO STAY AT THEIR POSTS WE CAN TALK TO FRANCOIS XAVIER DE DONYAEH WHO IS MINISTER OF STATE IN THE BELGIAN PARLIAMENT AND ALSO A FORMER MAYOR OF THE CITY OF BRUSSELS GOOD MORNING TO YOU
ANSWER FIRST OF ALL ON THE ARRESTS IN THE SITUATION AT THE MOMENT WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED
PEOPLE DIDN'T ARREST RESTLESS JUST AS THE APPARENTLY ONE OF THEM WAS ONE OF THE GUYS A COMPANY CAN CHARACTER CALCULATED TO BE TRUE BUT WITH SPEECH SO THEY'VE USED AN IMPORTANT PROGRESS THE LEVEL OF ALERT
THE SITUATION IS VERY RAW IT WAS ONE OF OUR NEWSPAPERS ARE SAYING THIS MORNING THAT THE BRUSSELS CELL WAS PLOTTING A RADIOACTIVE BOMB ATTACK DISEASE THE GOVERNMENT TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY WAS THERE DO YOU THINK A REAL EFFORT UNDER WAY TO TRY TO GET HOLD OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL
WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTACKING THE STREET THE STREET
THEMSELVES IN THE SUBWAY AIRPORT THREAT NEUTRALISED WHIM OF THE POLICE OR INDEED A SORT OF APARTMENTS IN THE RUSSELL BRUSSELS LAST WEEK CAN I ASK YOU WHY THE QUESTION MY DEAD IS THE WAY THE BELGIAN OPERATES
GOING TO CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THIS BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF CRITICISMS ABOUT THE SECURITY SERVICES BUT ALSO ABOUT THE BASIC STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT IN BRUSSELS MARK DAMASCUS A BELGIAN ANY P. WAS ON THE PROGRAMME YESTERDAY TO SAYING THERE WERE NINETEEN MARES SIX POLICE ZONES THAT IT WAS A MESS DID DICK DO YOU BELIEVE NOW THAT THERE IS A GENUINE FEELING THAT THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE
BRUSSELS REGIONS ER DIDN'T DIDN'T NEED TO CHECK WHAT WAS REALLY GOING GOING UP AND HE DID CHANGE AND I THINK THAT USEFUL CHEAT ACTING UP WHICH WAS REORGANISED THE NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICE WHICH OF COURSE NO WE IN HOUSE THIS WILL IN THE PAST IN BRUSSELS THAT ORDERED THEM NOT TO LOOK TOO PRO FOLK NOT TO MELT
ER OF COURSE NOT
YOU SEEN THE BRUSSELS REGION BUT NOBODY KNOWS WHO DID IT
OR FOR CHILDREN DROP GOT TO SCHOOL AND WE CHERISH THE ALTERNATIVE WAS JUST A NEWT IN DRUGS IN SORRY MERLIN IN THE ORCHARD AT THAT RESTRICTED SO BUT I THINK THE SITUATION IN MANY MANY EUROPEAN CITIES MANY EUROPEAN BECAUSE IF YOU HAD SOME SO SILENT SYMPATHISERS WITH PROPER CORRECTLY PROTECTION TO PILLORY ARISTOCRATIC RADICALISE PEOPLE
I THINK THAT YOU THINK IN A BELL IN BELGIUM AND IN BRUSSELS WHETHER OBVIOUSLY IS A VERY BIG PROBABLY YOU THINK IN A WORD THERE WILL BE CHANGE NOW I THINK THERE WILL BE IMMENSE
FRANCOIS WE HAVE ALREADY ABOUT THERE WERE OUT OF TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US IT IS FOURTEEN MINUTES AFTER SEVEN I'M FED UP WITH DICK TAX FROM ABOVE SO YOU WILL DO THIS AND YOU WON'T DO THAT NOT ME THIS IS THE WORDS OF A CONSERVATIVE COUNCILLOR IN CHARGE OF EDUCATION IN DAVID CAMERON'S OWN BACKYARD IN HIS CONSTITUENCY SHE AND OTHERS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE SPOKEN TO THE B.B.C. OF THEIR ANGER AND ANOTHER CONTROVERSIAL
BUDGET ANNOUNCEMENT A PLEDGE THAT EVERY SCHOOL IN ENGLAND WILL BE FORCED TO BECOME AN ACADEMY WE ARE JOINED BY THE EDITOR OF THE MAGAZINE SCHOOLS WEEK LAURA MAC AND ERNIE MORNING TO YOU MORNING ALL SCHOOLS TO BECOME ACADEMIES LET'S JUST STOP REALLY WITH THE BASICS AND EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS IT SIMPLY MEANS LOCAL COUNCILLORS LOCALLY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WILL LOSE ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDUCATION
YEP AND THAT THAT'S CORRECT SO WHERE IN THE PAST SCHOOLS WERE RUN BY HEAD TEACHERS AND THEY WERE OVERSEEN BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY AND CLEAN LOCAL COUNCILLORS ACADEMIES ARE INSTEAD SCHOOLS RUN BY CHARITABLE TRUSTS THOSE TRUST COULD HAVE TWO FIVE UP TO FIFTY SCHOOLS OR MORE AND THAT'S DONE ON A CONTRACT FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITY IS OUT OF THE PICTURE AND HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO CONVERT SCHOOLS TO ACADEMY
I THINK GEORGE OSBORNE HAS PUT ASIDE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION POUNDS FOR CONVERSION AT THE MOMENT THERE IS POSSIBLY GOING TO BE SOME MORE AVAILABLE BUT IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE THAT'S ONLY A FEW THOUSAND PER SCHOOL AND IT CAN BE EXPENSIVE TO DO THINGS LIKE CHANGE SOFTWARE LEGAL FEES ARE HUGE AND SO AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A FEELING THAT THIS JUST ISN'T ENOUGH THERE'S ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND PER SCHOOL ISN'T IT IS WHAT IT WORKS OUT WHICH IS MONEY I SUSPECT ANY HEAD TEACHER BE DELIGHTED
IT'S AT LEAST THAT THERE ARE OFTEN OCCASIONS WHERE IT'S MUCH MORE ESPECIALLY IF THE SCHOOL HAS A COMPLICATED BUILDING STRUCTURE AND THEN THE LEGAL COSTS CAN GET MUCH MUCH HIGHER NOW THERE'S ALWAYS AN ARGUMENT WE HEAR IT WE MAY HEAR IT WHEN THE IS ON AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING ABOUT WHETHER THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE THAT ACADEMIES ARE ACTUALLY PERFORMING BETTER THAN OLD LOCAL AUTHORITY SCHOOLS
AND ALMOST EVERY IMPARTIAL REPORT INCLUDING ONE WRITTEN BY CROSS PARTY M.P.S LAST YEAR SAY THERE'S VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE RECENTLY THE SCHOOLS INSPECTOR OFSTED LOOKED AT SOME OF THE LARGEST TRUSTS AND THEY WERE PRETTY SCATHING AND THEY SAID THAT IN FACT THOSE MANIFESTED THE SAME WEAKNESSES AS THE WORST LOCAL AUTHORITIES ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S BEEN A REPORT THAT SAYS THE SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS ARE SOME VERY GOOD ONES VERY BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD WHY BEN OUR MINISTERS AS OBSESSED AS THEY ARE WITH THIS GUY
THAT'S YOUR VIEW I'LL ASK HIM BUT HE'S SURE THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A REALLY TRICKY QUESTION IT'S AN EASY SELL IN TERMS OF FREEDOM SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAY THERE ARE A FEW FREEDOMS AND ONE IS THAT THERE IS COMPLETE FREEDOM OVER PAY AND CONDITIONS FOR TEACHERS SO IT COULD BE ABOUT CHANGING SOME OF THE PAIN CONDITION RULES FOR TEACHERS MINISTERS DON'T LIKE MENTIONING THAT SO PERHAPS WE CAN ASK HIM LATER ON AND WE CERTAINLY WILL LAUREN I CAN ONLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN EASTER IS UPON US TIME TO TALK ABOUT CHOCOLATE HE'S TANYA YES WELL I'M JOINED AT THE SLIGHTLY LATER THAN USUAL TIME BY THIS WEEK'S FRIDAY BOSS AND IT IS ANGUS FELL WELL HE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND CO FOUNDER OF HOTEL SHOCK ALLOW WELCOME TO YOU HAVEN'T PAWNED HIS EASTER AS A TIME OF YEAR FOR YOU AS AGAINST VALENTINE'S OR CHRISTMAS I MEAN
OWN PURE MONETARY TERMS IT'S THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT EVENT BUT IN TERMS OF SECOND TO CHRISTMAS I'M SECOND CHRISTMAS EXACTLY TANYA BUT IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO EXCITE US AND EXCITABLE CONSUMERS I THINK IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
THERE'S SOMETHING ELEMENTAL ABOUT ABOUT THE EGG ABOUT LITTLE BUNNIES HOPPING AROUND WE'RE GOING TO SELL THOSE SKIPPER COME BACK TO THAT IN A SECOND BUT WHEN HE SET UP THE BUSINESS AND IT KIND OF GOT GOING REALLY IN THE LATE NINETIES IT WAS AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO SEE CONSUMERS AS PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BUY AN EXPERIENCE NOT JUST A PRODUCT SO IT WAS TIMELY AND AWAY
ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT REALLY MARKED THE SORT OF LOW POINT OF SORT OF BRITISH CHOCOLATE WHAT HAD BECOME THE VERY BORING AND FLAT PROPOSITION A LOT OF THE OFFERS WERE VERY DERIVATIVE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN BELGIUM OR SWITZERLAND OR FRANCE AND WHEN YOU HARK BACK TO THE PREVIOUS GLORY DAYS OF BRITISH CHOCOLATE NEARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS AND IN FACT THE EASTER EGG WAS INVENTED BY BY FRY IN BRISTOL IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS
WE'VE GOT A REPUTATION OF BEING INNOVATORS IN CHOCOLATE AND THAT IT'S TIME TO BRING HER BACK SO WHAT TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON THE HIGH STREET IT'S A REALLY TOUGH TIME TO BE ON THE HIGH STREET OF COURSE SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU ENGAGE WITH THE CONSUMER PROPERLY AND WHEN YOU GO INTO ONE OF YOUR SHOPS YOU'VE CLEARLY THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IT HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO GET THAT RIGHT
IT'S EVERYTHING PUT A SHOCKER IS ESCAPE THIS PROPOSITION WE LIKE TO WORK ON YOUR MIND AS WELL AS YOUR TASTEBUDS AND EVERY EVERYBODY WHO EVERY STORE HAS I'M A GRADUATE OF A SCHOOL OF CHOCOLATE AND WE WE'D LIKE OUR TEAMS TO BE CONFIDENT THAT CONFIDENCE AND HE COMES FROM KNOWLEDGE AND WHEN YOU FEEL SECURE IN KNOWING ABOUT COCOA AND CHOCOLATE
YOU WANT TO GO AND AND TALK ABOUT UNTIL EVERYBODY SO THAT'S REALLY THE FOUNDATION OF SONORAN WELCOME OR TALKING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE ERIC CORNELL HE WON THE NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE APPARENTLY SAID I ATTRIBUTE ESSENTIALLY ALL OF MY SUCCESS TO THE VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF CHOCOLATE THAT I CONSUME IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP THEIR GREY MATTER WITHOUT A I TO RUSTLE AROUND AND OFFER SOME TO TO JUSTIN AND NECK AND NECK THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED A CHOCOLATE BUNNY TOGETHER THAT'S GOT A BIT MORE GET YOU GETTING READY
HOPPING LIKE THAT EXCELLENT WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW CREATING NEW PRODUCTS I JUST VISUALISE YOU SITTING IN A ROOM TILL LATE AT NIGHT AND A CHOCOLATE BUNNY WE'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE HERE OR VERY INTUITIVE LOTS OF LITTLE CHOCOLATE BUNNIES EGG SANDWICH LESS OBVIOUS
IT WAS EXACTLY THAT WE WERE TRYING TO COME UP WITH A NEW TWIST ON ON THE EGG AND WE DO THINGS LIKE SUNNY SIDE UP EGGS AND VERY MATTER OF TIME UNTIL WE CAME TO THE EGG SANDWICH AND WE SCANNED IN SOME GRANARY BREAD WITH THAT'S A GREAT THING ABOUT CHOCOLATE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SCULPT IT INTO DIFFERENT SHAPES RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT SCULPTING TAXES THE CHANCELLOR WOULD LIKE TO BRING IN THE SUGAR TAX WOULDN'T APPLY TO YOU OF COURSE BUT WHAT DO YOU
I THINK IT'S SLIGHTLY IRONIC THAT JUST JUST WHEN THE CONSUMERS ARE WAKING UP TO MAKE THEIR OWN JUDGEMENT ABOUT THEM OUT OF SUGAR AND THINGS THAT WERE LEGISLATING FOR IT YOUNG PEOPLE EVIDENTLY AREN'T ARE THEY NO I THINK I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO ACT AND PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVEN'T GOT THEIR CRITICAL FACULTIES YET TO REALISE THAT
SOMETIMES SUGAR IS LURKING IN THINGS YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE AND HOW MUCH HE'S LOOKING IN YOUR CHOCOLATE VERY BRIEFLY AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE WE BELIEVE THAT COCOA SHOULD BE THE STAR OF THE SHOW AND SUGAR IS VERY MUCH THE SUPPORTIVE AXE AND STRICTLY AS LITTLE AS NECESSARY FORTY PERCENT
THAT'S THAT'S THE STARTER LEVEL AND THEN WE GO DOWN FROM THAT POINT RIGHT TO ZERO IN A HUNDRED PER CENT BECAUSE ANGUS THERE WERE A BROTHER OF MINE WHEN I'M CHOPPING THIS WEEKEND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED A CHOCOLATE FULL ENGLISH IS WHAT YOU NEED IF YOU PRESENT NO SPRING THERE WOULD YOU JUST GIVE ME A POWER OF GOOD YEAH IT IF I DON'T BY THE WAY THAT THE THING WITH THE FANCY RIBBONS IN THEIR BOXES STAYED VERY FIRMLY ON TEN
WE'VE GOT THAT RIGHT NOW NO I'M NOT BLACK THEY WERE YES THEY WERE RIVETED IT TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT WAS A SYMBOL OF A DESIRE TO DESTROY NOT JUST THEIR ENEMIES BUT THEIR CULTURE AND THEIR HISTORY TO THE BLOWING UP OF THE ANCIENT TEMPLE IN PALMYRA IN SYRIA BY SO CALLED AYE IT WAS OF COURSE WIDELY CONDEMNED AROUND THE WORLD THERE WAS GREAT OPTIMISM THIS MORNING THAT THAT SITE WITH ITS REMAINING ARCHAEOLOGICAL TREASURES AND THERE ARE SOME MIGHT SOON BE BACK
IN SOMEWHAT SAFER HANDS KATHRYN HANSON IS AN ARCHAEOLOGIST WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA CULTURAL HERITAGE CENTRE AND HAS WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ABOUT PALMYRA MORNING TO YOU CATHERINE
THE MINING THERE IS STILL A PURPOSE IN TAKING THIS SITE IS IT THERE IS STILL SOMETHING WORTH PRESERVING OH ABSOLUTELY PALMYRA IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE AND THERE ARE STILL STANDING REMAINS AT THE SITE FROM THE ROMAN PERIOD AS WELL THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION BELOW THE SURFACE AND THAT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE AND HOW CLOSE ARE THE FORCES THIS WILL BE THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES WITH THE HELP OF THE RUSSIANS AND THOSE AIR STRIKES HOW CLOSE ARE THEY TO RETAKING THAT SITE
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF PROJECTIONS MOST OF WHAT I'D HEARD US IN THE NEXT DAY HERSELF OH IT'S REALLY SOON AS THAT
I CAN'T SAY SPECIFICALLY WHEN I'VE HEARD SEVERAL PRODUCTIONS OF THEY'VE TAKEN AREAS OF THE NEARBY LOCATIONS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT MILITARY SITE PAST WHICH IS WHY THE ROMANS TOOK IT OVER
AND IT CONTINUES TO BE OF MILITARY STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TODAY SURE IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS DEFEATING IESUS FORCES AND THEN OUT YOU GET YOU ARCHAEOLOGISTS WITH TROWELS OF BRUSHES AND SEE WHAT'S LEFT AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN RESERVE IT WILL BE A LOT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT VERY MUCH SO IN FACT PALMYRA WERE TRAGICALLY AS A SOAP THAT'S BEEN DAMAGED SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE CONFLICT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY IT WAS DAMAGED IN FIRE FIGHTS AND HEAVY BATTLES IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CONFLICT
IT WAS DAMAGED BY THE ASIDE REGIMES SYRIAN ARMY WHEN THEY EMBEDDED ENTRENCHED IN A BUILDING FORTIFICATION WALLS AND THEN IT WAS ALSO DAMAGED VERY PROVOCATIVE WE'D BY ISIS MOST RECENTLY IN REALLY PROPAGANDA DEMONSTRATED P.R. EFFORTS TO DO EXPLOSIONS TO SHOW
THEIR POWER OVER THE SITE BUT THEY ALSO DID A LOT OF MASS MURDERERS IN THE ROMAN THEORY THERE AND KILLING CIVILIANS ATTACHED ANCIENT COLUMNS BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD CAN WE JUST REMIND PEOPLE OF WHY THEY OUGHT TO CARE BECAUSE THEY MAY BE SEEING FURTHER GRIM NEWS ABOUT TERRORISM IN EUROPE AND THEY MAY YOU STICK AN OLD TEMPLE IN SYRIA DO I MIND
WELL THE ANCIENTS OUT UPON MY AS ONE OF THE WORLD ONE OF THE SIX WORLD HERITAGE SITES AND CERIA PALMYRA IS AND PROBABLY THE MOST IMPRESSIVE STANDING ROMAN RUINS OF ITS TYPE THAT STILL EXISTS AND IT WAS THE MAIN TOURIST DRAMA WHEN SYRIA WAS A TOURIST DESTINATION
AND WHEN THE CERIA BECOMES A TOURIST DESTINATION AGAIN FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT THE SADIE'S GOING TO BECOME VERY IMPORTANT KATHRYN HANSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND GARY'S OVER THE SPORT MORNING WALES OR NORTHERN IRELAND LIMBERED UP FOR THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH A ONE ONE DRAW IN CARDIFF SIMON CHURCH SCORED A LATE EQUALISER FOR WALES AFTER CRAIG CATHCART HAD GIVEN IRELAND THE LEAD IAN BROWN ASSESSES WHAT THE TWO MANAGERS WILL HAVE LEARNED FROM LAST NIGHT'S MATCH
NO GREATER INTENSITY ABOUT THE MATCH BUT A DRAMATIC FINISH SIR SIMON SHIRT SCORED A LATE PENALTY TO EARN WALES A SHARE OF THE SPOILS
THAT CANCELLED OUT A REALLY STYLISH GOAL SCORED ON THE HOUR BY WHAT FOR DEFENDER CRAIG CATHCART FOR WALES IT WAS A BIT OF AN EXERCISE IN COPING WITHOUT BAIL AND RAMSAY NOT EASY BUT YOUNG GEORGE WILLIAMS AND DAVID COTTERELL WHAT AMONGST THOSE IMPRESSING
NORTHERN IRELAND WERE CLOSER TO FULL STRENGTH WITH MICHAEL O'NEIL STARTING WITH THREE AT THE BACK BUT FOUR AT THE BACK SEEM TO WORK BETTER IN THE SECOND HALF TWELVE SUBSTITUTIONS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE GENUINE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT LIES AHEAD LET'S GET THAT THE VERDICT OF THE WALES MANAGER CHRIS COLEMAN
WE'VE GOT WHAT WE WANTED OUT OF IT TONIGHT WE GET LAWS WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WERE ONE YOU'RE DOWN WITH FIVE MINUTES TO GO
SO WE'VE GOT SOMETHING OUT OF THE GAME WHICH WAS A RESULT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THE STAGE
WELL AWARE THAT GOING INTO THIS TOURNAMENT ONE OF THE LADS GOT A BIT MORE EXPERIENCE
AND THE ISLAND MANAGER MICHAEL O'NEIL WAS GENERALLY GENERALLY HAPPY WITH HIS TEAM'S PERFORMANCE WE HAVE PLAYERS THAT PLAY THE CLUB FOOTBALL AT A LOWER LEVEL IF YOU LOOK OUR SUBSTITUTIONS WE BROUGHT ON TONIGHT WE CAN BRING ANYONE ON FROM EIGHT LEAGUE WON AN S.P.L. PLAYERS SO EVERY TIME WE PUT THEM ON THE PACKS IN THE PLAY AT THIS LEVEL BEGIN MORE CONFIDENCE FROM AND WE SEE
I THINK YOUR TIMES OF PLAYERS WHO PLAY AT THAT HIGHER LEVEL LET'S SIGNIFICANTLY EVERY WEEK SO WHEN YOU BRING PLAYERS AND THEY GET THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT COMMON GROUND THE FOOTBALL AT A LOWER LEVEL AND YOU SEE THEM DO ITSELF THAT'S ENCOURAGING SCOTLAND TRAVEL TO PRAGUE AND SECURED A ONE NIL WIN AGAINST THE CZECH REPUBLIC IT CATCHY ANYA SCORED A GOAL MANAGER GORDON STRACHAN
THE WHOLE SQUAD TO THEMSELF EVA'S TONIGHT BIGGEST FAVOURS IT WON AND WERE IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY IN THE SECOND HALF SO THERE'S A LOT I CAN CONSULTANT YOU KNOW WHAT FORCED TO MAKE FAKERS LISTEN YOU COME ALONG HERE AND PRESSURE ON THESE GUYS
SO THEY CAN BE PLEASE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY USED TO WHAT ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND HALF GORDON STRACHAN THERE ARE PAGES OF TRIBUTES IN THE MORNING PAPERS TO JOHANN CROY WHO'S DIED AT THE AGE OF SIXTY EIGHT THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HEADLINE SIMPLY SAYS A GENIUS LIKE NO OTHER
GARY LINEKER PAY DISTRIBUTE IF ENGLISH FOOTBALL HAS PRODUCED A I THINK OUR GAME WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT
WHAT IT IS BECAUSE CROY PH COULD NEVER COPE WITH ENGLISH STYLE FOOTBALL ONE OF HIS GREAT SAYINGS WAS THAT USED TO SAY STOP RUNNING STOP RUNNING SO MUCH FOOTBALL'S NOT ABOUT
RUNNING IS EVERYTHING IS IN THE BRAIN IT'S ABOUT THE SPEED OF THE BRAIN NOT THE SPEED OF THE LEXAN OBVIOUSLY IT WAS ALL ABOUT STOPPING AND STARTING QUICKLY AND THINGS YEAH I THINK IF HE'D HAVE BEEN ENGLISH I THINK HE'D HAVE TRANSFORMED FOOTBALL LIKE HE DID BOTH FOR THE DUTCH AND OF COURSE THE SPANISH AS WELL WHO WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET HIM AT BARCELONA
GARY LINEKER ON JOHANN CROY FOODS DIED AT THE AGE OF SIXTY EIGHT SUPER LEAGUE THE CHAMPIONS LEEDS CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE LOSING FOR A FIFTH TIME IN SEVEN MATCHES CASTLEFORD BEAT THEM EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN WITH JAKE WEBSTER SCORING A LATE TRY TENNIS AT THE MY OWN MAMET MIAMI OPEN HEATHER WATSON HAS REACHED THE THIRD ROUND DEFEATING SLOAN STEVENS' SIX THREE SIX LOVE AND THEN GLYNN'S CRICKETERS HAVE BEATEN THE WEST INDIES IN THE WORLD TWENTY TWENTY TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE SEMI FINALS

HAS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT BEING PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD GET IN THE WAY OF BRITAIN PROVIDING SECURITY FOR ITS CITIZENS GENERAL MICHAEL HEAD AND SAYS HE AGREES WITH THE FORMER BOSS OF M.I.SIX SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE THAT LEAVING EUROPE COULD OFFER SECURITY GAINS
SEVERAL SENIOR CONSERVATIVE COUNCILLORS HAVE CRITICISED GOVERNMENT PLANS TO CONVERT ALL STATE SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND INTO ACADEMIES SOME HAVE RAISED CONCERNS THAT SMALL PRIMARY SCHOOLS COULD FACE CLOSURE IF ACADEMY CHAINS DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE VIABLE THE GOVERNMENT ARGUES THAT ACADEMIES CAN GIVE HEAD TEACHERS MORE FREEDOM
TEACHING UNIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT STAFF RECEIVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS IN COMPENSATION LAST YEAR FOR LONG TERM INJURIES AND DISCRIMINATION ONE OF THE LARGEST PAYOUTS WAS TO A FIFTY NINE YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO SUFFERED BACK INJURIES AFTER BEING KNOCKED TO THE GROUND BY A PUPIL

LEADER NICOLA STURGEON SO EVENTUALLY SHE WANTED A FIFTY PENCE TOP RATE OF INCOME TAX
TRIBUTES ARE BEING PAID TO THE AMERICAN COMEDIAN GARY SHAMBLING HE'S BEST REMEMBERED FOR THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW WRECKAGE OF A. IS CALLED HIM ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL COMEDIANS OF A GENERATION
THANK YOU CATHY IT'S TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT O'CLOCK IT FELT LIKE A VERY GOOD FRIDAY INDEED EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN AN AGREEMENT WAS FINALLY REACHED TO PUT AN END TO WHAT WE EUPHEMISTICALLY CALLED THE TROUBLES THAT DECADES OF MURDER AND MAYHEM IN NORTHERN IRELAND IT SINCE THEN THE PIECES SEEMED WELL RELATIVE AND THE RECONCILIATION FAR FROM COMPLETE LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT AGO A PRISON OFFICER DIED AFTER HIS VAN WAS BLOWN UP BY A GROUP CALLING ITSELF
THE NEW I R. A. I'VE BEEN TALKING TO TONY BLAIR WHO AS PRIME MINISTER SIGNED THAT HISTORIC AGREEMENT
WE KNEW THE AGREEMENT WAS HISTORIC BUT WE ALSO KNEW THAT IT WAS ONLY A BEGINNING AND THERE WE CONCLUDED THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT IN APRIL NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WE THEN HAD ALMOST TEN YEARS
STUDIED IMPLEMENTATION SOME OF WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT WHERE THINGS WERE CONTINUALLY BREAKING DOWN AND HAD TO BE PUT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND IT WAS REALLY ONLY WHEN WE GOT THE POWER SHARING EXECUTIVE TOGETHER IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SHORTLY BEFORE I LEFT OFFICE THAT THE THING LOOK LOOK REALLY SOLID SO I DON'T THINK WE CAN BE SURPRISED IT'S SUCH A MOMENTOUS THING
TO HAVE HAPPENED BUT IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME FOR IT THEN FOR ALL ITS IMPLICATIONS TO BE FULLY PUT IN PLACE YOU SAID THAT THE BURDEN OF HISTORY WAS AT LONG LAST BEING LIFTED FROM OUR SHOULDERS
DOES IT WORRY YOU THAT THE BURDEN OF HISTORY IS STILL REALLY ON THE SHOULDERS OF PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND THEY HAVEN'T LIVED
WERE A WORLD AWAY TODAY IN NORTHERN IRELAND FROM WHERE WE WERE BUT I THINK IT IS TRUE THAT THIS PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION TAKES A LONG TIME YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH ENTRENCHED ATTITUDES EVER A VERY LONG PERIOD
AND THOSE ENTRENCHED ATTITUDES HE ARE THEY TOUCH
VERY VERY SENSITIVE AND RAW NERVES WITHIN THE POPULATION SO IT'S FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES BUT HE'S PROBABLY NOT SURPRISING
PARAMILITARIES ARE STILL OPERATING WEAPONS ARE STILL IN USE POLITICS IS STILL COMPLETELY DYSFUNCTIONAL COMMUNITIES ARE STILL DEEPLY CELLAR SEGREGATED IN A SENSE HAVEN'T WE BOUGHT RELATIVE PEACE AN END OF THE WORST OF THE VIOLENCE BUT WE HAVEN'T ACHIEVED RECONCILIATION AT ALL
IAN PAISLEY SITTING DOWN IN GOVERNMENT WITH MARTIN MCGUINNESS WE'VE ACHIEVED A HUGE AMOUNT SO WE SHOULDN'T FORGET THAT AND OUR RELATIONSHIP INDEED WITH THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND'S COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED
WHAT IS TRUE IS THAT SOME OF THE DEEP
SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN THEIR POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES STILL REMAIN WHAT IS TRUE ALSO IS THAT IT'S STILL VERY EASY THE POLITICS TO BREAK BACK INTO SECTARIANISM
I THINK THE THE ANSWER TO THIS IS THAT IT TAKES A LONG PERIOD OF TIME SO I JUST THINK IN NORTHERN IRELAND WE WE'VE GOT TO BE REALISTIC
AND WE'VE ALSO GOT TO KEEP WORKING AT IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T STOP WORKING AT IT AND I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO DO THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT THE RECONCILIATION TODAY HOLD YOU WORRIED THAT ATTENTION HAS GONE ELSEWHERE
I THINK THERE WAS ALWAYS A RISK THAT THE ATTENTION GOES ELSEWHERE AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS WE'VE GOTTEN THESE ISSUES TO DO WITH EXTREMISM AND SECURITY AND SO ON SO IT'S I'M NOT CRITICISING ANYONE IN GOVERNMENT NOW BUT I AM JUST POINTING OUT THAT WE DIDN'T DO THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND THEN
PACK UP AND GO HOME WE WORK WE WERE ON THE CASE FOR THE NEXT DECADE AND HOW FEARFUL ARE YOU THAT THE PARAMILITARIES COULD COME BACK WE KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT VIOLENCE TO MARK THE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EASTER RISING
DOES IT MAKE YOU VERY NERVOUS THAT WE COULD SEE THOSE BAD DAYS AGAIN YOU'VE GOT TO BE APPREHENSIVE AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE
VIGILANT FOR SURE BUT THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHEN THE I R.A. WERE OPERATING IN SOME OF THE LOYALIST GROUPS WERE OPERATING WHEN WE FIRST CAME
INTO OFFICE IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN FOR THE DECADES BEFORE THAT THEY WERE OPERATING OFTEN WITH AIG A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT WITHIN LOCAL COMMUNITIES I DON'T THINK THAT SUPPORT FOR THIS TERRORISM AS THEY ARE IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TODAY
BUT THERE WILL BE SOME ON THE FRINGES THAT WANT TO ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DROP YOUR GUARD AT ALL IT'S THE NEXT STEP TO ATTACK
THE INSTITUTIONS THAT DIVIDE COMMUNITIES SEGREGATED SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE OBAMA WAS VERY POWERFUL WHEN HE LAST VISITED NORTHERN IRELAND HE SAID
YOUR TOWNS REMAIN DIVIDED OF CATHOLICS HAVE THEIR SCHOOLS AND BUILDINGS IT PROTESTANTS HAVE THEIRS IF WE CAN'T SEE OURSELVES IN ONE ANOTHER IT FEAR OR RESENTMENT OR ALLOWED TO HARDEN THAT ENCOURAGES DIVISION
YOU'VE GOT TO BREAK DOWN SEGREGATION IT'S NOT DONE ALWAYS BUY
LAWS OR BY POLITICAL AGREEMENTS IT'S ALSO DOWN AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL IT'S DONE IN BY CHANGES OF ATTITUDE IN THE MINDSET OF THE TIME AND IT'S ALSO BY
BY ACHIEVING A SENSE IN THE POLITICS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO MOVE ON NOW YOU'VE STILL GOT A SITUATION WHERE THE PARTIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND THEY HAVE POWER SHARING AGREEMENT BUT THEY'RE STILL VERY MUCH DEFINED BY THEIR POSITION FROM TRADITIONAL COMMUNITIES
IN TIME YOU'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU BREAK THOSE BARRIERS DOWN AS ONE OF THE SHORT A BUT BUT THIS THIS TAKES A LONG TIME IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY ONE DRAMATIC CHANGE WOULD BE IF SINN FEIN HAD THE FIRST MINISTER MARTIN MCGUINNESS WITH THE FIRST MINISTER AND IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE OVER THE YEARS THAT SINN FEIN COULD HER POWER NORTH AND SELF WE READY FOR
WELL I DON'T AND I DON'T THINK IT'S RUSHED ME PREDICTION SOFTEN THAT BASES AND PROBABLY THE ONE THING I DO REMEMBER FROM MY TIME IN NORTHERN IRELAND THERE ARE CERTAIN QUESTIONS YOU ANSWER AND CERTAIN QUESTIONS YOU DON'T THAT'S DEFINITELY THE CATEGORY WHEN YOU DON'T BUT IN THE END LOOK I THINK IT DEPENDS ALSO ON
ON POLITICAL LEADERSHIP I MAKE THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THERE WERE POLITICAL LEADERS WILL IT LEAD AND THE NEXT STAGE OF BREAKING DOWN THESE BARRIERS SECTARIANISM AND MAKING DECISIONS ON THE BASIS OF QUALITY
THAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT A DEMOCRACY IS TAKEN ROOT AND THAT IS WHEN YOU ELECT THE BEST
PERSON AND YOUR JUDGEMENT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW IT'S NOT WHETHER PEASANT CAME FROM OR WHAT BACKGROUND IT'S WHAT THEY STAND FOR WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR THE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING WE'RE NOT AT THAT POINT YET NORTHERN IRELAND BUT WE CAN GET THERE
DOES IT WORRY THAT JUSTICE IS STILL DENIED FOR MANY ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING THINGS FOR YOU I THINK HIS PRIME MINISTER WAS THAT OMAGH BOMBING AND STILL NOBODY BROUGHT TO JUSTICE
YES THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU
HORRIBLE EVENTS LIKE HOMER AND EVEN THESE YEARS LATER PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN BROUGHT TO JUSTICE FOR THEM BUT I THINK AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT
DIFFERENT CONFLICTS AROUND THE WORLD THOSE CHARACTERISTICS ARE THERE AND YOU KNOW IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO REMOVE THE PAIN OF THE VICTIMS OF THE CONFLICT BUT WHAT WE ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE WERE NEGOTIATING THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT AND THEN THE SUBSEQUENT AGREEMENTS WAS THAT A A PURPOSE WAS
TO DIMINISH THE POSSIBILITY THAT THAT MORE VICTIMS OF CONFLICT WOULD RIGHT TONY BLAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE PAPERS MANY OF THEM CONTINUED TO ANALYSE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE BRUSSELS BOMBING ON ITS FRONT PAGE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH REPORTS THE ATTACKS EXPOSED WEAKNESSES IN EUROPE'S INTELLIGENCE SHARING BRITAIN IT REPORTS WAS NOT WARNED ABOUT ONE OF THE BOMBERS EVEN THEIR BELGIUM HAD BEEN TOLD THAT HE WAS A FIGHTER WITH THE GROUP CALLING ITSELF ISLAMIC STATE
INDEPENDENT SAYS EUROPEAN LEADERS MUST ACCEPT THAT THEY ARE NOW AT WAR IN THE RATES POLITICIANS FOR THEIR UTTER FAILURE TO FORGE AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO WHAT IT SAYS IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT FROM MILITANT ISLAMISM THE SUN AND THE MAIL CARRY COMMENTS FROM AN UNCLE OF THE BACK ROW HE BROTHERS WHO BELIEVE THEMSELVES UP IN THE ATTACKS HE TELLS HOW THE MEN BOTH WORKED AS CLEANERS AT THE AIRPORT THEY TARGETED ON TUESDAY HE DESCRIBES THEM AS NORMAL BOYS AND SAYS ONE OF THEM WAS ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER

OF THE NATIONS IN THE INTERVIEW WITH INDEPENDENT THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MACDONALD SAYS THAT ANTI SEMITIC VIEWS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED IN THE LABOUR PARTY AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS OF DAMAGING ALLEGATIONS HE TELLS THE PAPER THAT ANYONE EXPRESSING SUCH OPINION SHOULD BE BANNED FROM BEING A LABOUR MEMBER FOR LIFE THEY SHOULD BE OUT OUT OUT
THE INDEPENDENT SAYS HIS COMMENTS APPEAR TO BE TOUGHER THAN THOSE OF THE PARTY LEADER JEREMY CORBIN HE SAID THIS WEEK THAT ANY ALLEGATIONS OF ANTI CEMETERIES AND WOULD BE PROPERLY INVESTIGATED THERE ARE DIRE WARNINGS IN THE EXPRESS IN THE SUN ABOUT THE PREPAREDNESS OF ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY WARDS FOR THE EASTER BREAK THE EXPRESS SAYS THE CLOSURE OF G.P. SURGERIES WILL COST THE N.H.S. UP TO TEN MILLION POUNDS BECAUSE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL GO TO ANY FOR THEIR TREATMENT THE SUN SAYS HEALTH CHIEF IT'S FEAR A CRISIS WHEN MANY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT STRUGGLING TO COPE
THE PAPER REPORTS THAT SOME G.P.S ARE BEING OFFERED ONE HUNDRED AND TEN POUNDS AN HOUR TO HELP OUT IN OVERSTRETCHED HOSPITALS OVER THEIR FOUR DAY WEEKEND SEEMS THE BEST PLACE TO ENJOY A CLASSICAL MUSIC IS A SHOEBOX THAT TELEGRAPH REPORTS ON NEW RESEARCH ON HOW AUDIENCES RESPOND TO MUSIC IN DIFFERENT SHAPED BUILDINGS LONG RECTANGULAR CONCERT HALLS WERE FOUND TO BE THE BEST VENUES FOR ELICITING AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE RULING OUT OF COURSE MANY OF LONDON'S
BIGGEST VENUES THE BARBICAN THE ROYAL FESTIVAL HALL AND THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL AS WELL IT IS TWENTY TO EIGHT A CHINA'S LEADERS LOSING THEIR GRIP ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH THE QUESTION ARISES BECAUSE OF THE PUBLICATION OF HER LETTER CALLING ON THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT TO RESIGN THEY'VE BEEN ARRESTS AS MANY AS TWENTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DETAINED BUT BEHIND THE SCENES WHAT'S GOING ON FROM BEIJING IS OUR CORRESPONDENT JOHN SUPPER
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBTING THAT OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES CHINA HAS CHANGED DEAR COMRADE SHOOTING PAIN BUT NOT ENOUGH TO DO THIS
WE ARE LOYAL PARTY MEMBERS WE WRITE THIS LETTER ASKING YOU TO RESIGN FROM ALL PARTY AND STATE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS THIS EXTRAORDINARY LETTER APPEARED EARLIER THIS MONTH ON A GOVERNMENT BACKED WEBSITE IT WAS QUICKLY DELETED BY THE AUTHORITIES BUT IT'S NOT THE FIRST PUBLIC CRITICISM OF CHINA'S POWERFUL PRESIDENT IN RECENT WEEKS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE POMP AND CEREMONY OF CHINA'S ANNUAL PARLIAMENTARY GATHERING AND ONLINE MAGAZINE SEEN AS RELATIVELY LIBERAL IN OUTLOOK PUBLISHED AN INTERVIEW WITH ONE OF THE DELEGATES IT WHICH HE CALLED FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH
THE ARTICLE TO WAS QUICKLY DELETED
BUT THE MAGAZINE THEN DID SOMETHING VERY BRAVE IT PUBLISHED A FOLLOW UP ARTICLE ALONG WITH ANOTHER INTERVIEW WITH THE SAME DELEGATE THIS TIME CRITICISING THE CENSORSHIP AND AN ACCOMPANYING PICTURE OF A MOUTH GAGGED WITH MASKING TAPE
THE OUTSPOKEN PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATE A MAN CALLED PROFESSOR ZHANG HONG EVEN REPEATED HIS CALL FOR PRESS FREEDOM IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE B.B.C.
YOU HAVE THOUGHT WILLOW BUT FOR KEITH AND SEEN THE FIRE IF THE SOCIETY ONLY LISTENS TO ONE VOICE THEN MISTAKES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE OLDER AND A GOOD WAY TO PREVENT MISTAKES FROM HAPPENING IS TO LET EVERYONE SPEAK UP THOUGH ON THE COOK AND TO LET HER SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE
BUT PRESIDENT SHE GIN PING IS MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH THE INCREASING CENSORSHIP AND HIS CRACKDOWN ON CRITICISM AND DISSENT EVEN PROMPTING COMPARISONS WITH THE DARK DAYS OF CHAIRMAN MAO'S CULTURAL REVOLUTION
IT WAS A TIME OF MASS MOBILISATION AND SONGS OF PATRIOTIC INDOCTRINATION DURING WHICH ALL OPPOSITION TO CHAIRMAN MAO AND ALSO CALLED BOURGEOIS THOUGHT AND LIBERAL IDEAS CAME UNDER SUSTAINED ATTACK
THEY ARE CONSTANT EFFORTS TO GO BACK TO CULTURE REVOLUTION I USED SOME OF THE TEAR TICKS THEIR MILE USED IN CARD
I GUESS INTELLECTUAL SORT OF PIERCED HIS POLITICAL RIVALS ZHANG CHAN FAN HE'S A LAW PROFESSOR AT PEKING UNIVERSITY
THE REPRESSION IS INCREASING HE SAYS BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT TODAY IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE MEANS TO FIGHT BACK IT BECAUSE MUCH HARDER TO SUCCEED ESPECIALLY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNET BECAUSE MUCH HARDER TO FORCE PEOPLE TO SHUT THEM
SPEAKING OUT IS STILL INCREDIBLY RISKY AND A LETTER CALLING FOR PRESIDENT SHE GIN PINGS RESIGNATION IS PURE POLITICAL DYNAMITE THOSE OF US WHO EXPERIENCED THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION SECRETLY WORRY
A PARITY COUNTRY AND PEOPLE CANNOT BEAR ANOTHER DECADE OF CALAMITY
COULD THIS BE A RARE GLIMPSE OF POLITICAL CRACKS AT THE HEART OF AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHETHER THE LETTER IS GENUINELY WRITTEN AS IT CLAIMS BY PARTY INSIDERS OR SOME KIND OF FAKE
WHAT WE CAN SAY IS THAT EVEN AS CHINA TITANS CONTROL THE VOICES OF OPPOSITION ARE FINDING A WAY TO BE HEARD
THAT WAS JOHN'S HAD WORTH REPORTING FROM BEIJING BUT I KNOW A SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND ON THIS GOOD FRIDAY MORNING THE SPEAKER IN A CANTERBURY STUDIO IS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY JUSTIN WELBY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING FOR ME ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST CHALLENGING PARTS OF CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL IS THE NUMBER OF MEMORIALS TO PAST ARCHBISHOPS
THERE ARE SAINTS AND TO BE HONEST VILLAINS THE BRILLIANT AND THE DULL SOME WISH HEROES DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE RIGHT REASON OTHERS ACTED CRUELLY AND BRUTALLY YOU WENT T.S. ELIOT'S GREAT SENTENCE PUT INTO BECKETTS MOUTH IN HIS PLAY MURDER IN THE CATHEDRAL THEY WERE TEMPTED TO THE GREATEST TREASON DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE WRONG REASON
ALL HAD MIXED MOTIVES AND CHARACTERS
GOOD FRIDAY THE DAY ON WHICH CHRISTIANS REMEMBER THE DEATH OF JESUS ON THE CROSS CHALLENGES ALL OUR REASONS FOR EVERYTHING WE DO ALL THE MOTIVATIONS WE CLAIM FOR ANY ACTION GOOD FRIDAY HAS THAT HEALTHY NECESSARY ASPECT THAT IS FOUND IN MANY FAITHS OF A TIME FOR SELF EXAMINATION
IN THE WEEK OF THE ATTACKS IN BELGIUM AND OF RECALLING THE HORRORS AND CRIMES OF THE BALKAN CIVIL WAR WITH THE CONVICTION OF RADHA VAN CARRIAGE EJ I AM STRUCK BY THE SAVAGERY AND BITTERNESS THE UTTERLY PERVERTED REASONS OF THE ATTACKERS AND PERPETRATORS CARRYING OUT NOT RIGHT DEEDS BUT THE MOST DEEPLY WRONG ONES THAT COULD BE IMAGINED AND THE CONTRAST WITH THE SACRIFICE OF JESUS
HE WAS THE ONE PERSON IN HISTORY CHRISTIANS BELIEVED TO HAVE HAD ONLY PURE MOTIVES FOR ALL YOU DID FOR ME HE SETS THE STANDARD FOR BOTH ACTIONS AND REASONS THE NATURE OF HATRED IS THAT IT IS INFECTIOUS
TERROR WINS WHEN IT CAUSES OTHERS TO FEAR OR HATE ON GOOD FRIDAY TERROR AND OPPRESSION ARE MET BY THE LOVE WITH JESUS PRAYING FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF THOSE WHO CAUSE HIS DEATH
CHRISTIAN'S CONSIDERING THE CROSS SEE GOD CRUCIFIED BECAUSE OF HUMAN CRUELTY AND SCENT
THE MYSTERY OF THE IMMENSE SAVAGERY OF HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A DESIRE TO USE POWER TO HARM NOT HERE OR IS ONE THAT CONFOUNDS ALL ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN IT AWAY
THE DEPTH OF THE GRIP ON US HELD BY LUST FOR POWER AND THE DESIRE TO DOMINATE OTHERS IS JUDGED BY THE CRUCIFIXION
BEFORE IT WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH A WRONG REASONS AND ACTIONS
BUT I FIND MYSELF ALSO CONFRONTED WITH THE LOVE OF GOD THAT GOES DEEPER THAN A CRUELTY OF GOD'S REACHING OUT TO US THAT GOES BEYOND OUR PRIDE AND POWER SEEKING
ONE OF THE MESSAGES CHALKED ON A BRUSSELS PAVEMENT THIS WEEK WAS HOPE IS A RESISTANCE IT IS COMPELLINGLY TRUE EVEN ON THIS DAY EVEN IN THIS WEEK I FIND HOPE BECAUSE FOR ME AT THE END OF ALL THINGS GOD IS OVERWROUGHT
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY JUSTIN WELBY THE TIME IS THIRTY MINUTES TO EIGHT A ROW ABOUT TAX DOMINATED THE TELEVISED DEBATE BETWEEN THE SCOTTISH PARTY LEADERS LAST NIGHT SCOTTISH ELECTIONS COURSE MAY THE FIFTH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE NORTH OF THE BORDER TO CHOOSE NEW GOVERNMENT AND AS THE NON S. M. P. PARTIES HAVE POINTED OUT IN THE OPPOSITION AS WELL AND THE CHOICES FACING SCOTS ARE AT THEIR CLEAREST WHEN IT COMES TO TAX
THE CONSERVATIVES WORRIED THAT THE NATION COULD BECOME A HIGH TAX BACK WHATEVER LABOUR WANTING THE HIGHEST RATE INCREASED AND THE S.N.P. WELL DEFENDING ITS VIEW THAT NOTHING SHOULD BE DONE VERY QUICKLY HE'S A SCOTLAND EDITOR SARAH SMITH
THE STUDIOS HERE IN GLASGOW A BOISTEROUS SOMETIMES ROWDY T. V. DEBATE MARKED THE START OF THE SCOTTISH ELECTION CAMPAIGN WASN'T GOING TO TAKE THAT WITH HORSE GLEN CAMPBELL TRYING TO STOP THE SIX PARTY LEADERS ON STAGE FROM ALL TALKING OVER EACH OTHER LET'S NOT ONLY TRIED TO DRAG ME I'M GOING TO THINK YOU'RE OVER ONE ANOTHER NOBODY AT HOME CAN HEAR WHAT REALLY GOT THEM GOING WAS THE ISSUE THAT WILL DOMINATE THE SELECTION TAX
THE NEXT SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE POWER TO SET ALL INCOME TAX BANDS AND RATES AND ON THIS THE SCOTTISH LABOUR LEADER KEZIA DUGDALE DIFFERS FROM JEREMY CARBON AND THE U.K. PARTY WHEN SHE SAYS SHE WILL RAISE ALL RATES OF INCOME TAX
WE SHOULD PICK ONE PENCE ONE PENCE HIGHER THAN THE RATE THAT GEORGE OSBORNE INSET IN THE SCOTTISH BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX AND IF WE DID THAT WE CAN RAISE ENOUGH MONEY TO STOP THE CAR
ONE MORE TAXING THAN WE WOULD DO YOU WOULD ASK THE RICHEST APPEAR A BIT MORE ASK THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR TO BE A FIFTY P. V. THE S.N.P. LEADER NICOLA STURGEON SO SHE WOULD REVERSE GEORGE OSBORNE'S PLAN TO RAISE THE THRESHOLD FOR THOSE PAYING THE HIGHER RATE OF TAX BUT WOULD NOT INCREASE ANY TAXES
TWO POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE INCLUDING HALF A MILLION PENSIONERS HERE THE BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX MANY OF THEM ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET HOUSEHOLD INCOMES AND UNDER REAL PRESSURE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO TRANS FAIR THE BARBED ENOUGH TALLEST EDITED ON TO THEIR SHOULDERS RATHER THAN DO THAT I WANT THE TOP TEN PER CENT A SHOULDER MAUD OF THE BIRD AND SO WE'RE NOT PASSING ON THAT TAX CUT THAT GEORGE OSBORNE HAS RAISED THE MONEY YOU NEED TO END THERE COS I DON'T USE IN THE B. NOT TO BE SAVOURED
TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO EARN TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FROM PENNY PENNY MORTON YOU HAPPENING I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WERE DOING I DID YOU HAVE FAILED BUT IT'S NOT YOU DID I TELL YOU WHAT I THINK'S THE PRINCE WHAT DO I DISAGREE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF TRANSFERRING THE BURDEN OF TOADIE HE STATED TO GO SIR CAN WE AFFORD NOT TO TALK TO YOU LOOK FANTASTIC IN THE HEAT OF THE DEBATE NICOLA STURGEON WAS ACCUSED OF BEING TIMID BECAUSE SHE WON'T RAISE THE TOP RATE OF TAX TO FIFTY P.
SHE HAS SAID BEFORE SHE WANTS TO BUT NOW CLAIMS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TOO EASY FOR A WEALTHY TAXPAYERS TO AVOID PAYING IT THE GOVERNMENT COULD LOSE MONEY AS A RESULT
FOR THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVES RUTH DAVIDSON IS RATHER PLEASED TO FIND SHE'S THE ONLY MAJOR PARTY LEADER IN SCOTLAND WHO DOESN'T WANT TO INCREASE PEOPLE'S TAX BILLS
PEOPLE AT HOME HAVE JUST WATCHED THE FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLAND SEEING SHE WANTS TO MAKE SCOTLAND THE HIGHEST TAX PART OF THE U.K. AND THEN THEY JUST WATCH THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION SAY THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WE NEED TO TAKE MORE MONEY OFF WORKING SCOTT WE HAVE AN ABSOLUTE PRINCIPLE THAT WE DON'T THINK PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND SHOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE TAX AND THE REST OF THE U.K.
WE DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD FOR SCOTLAND I DON'T BECAUSE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT HANGING A SIGN AT THE BORDER THAT SAYS HIGHER TAXES HERE ENCOURAGES EITHER THE GROWTH OR THE INVESTMENT OR THE JOBS WE NEED TO PROPERLY FUND OUR PUBLIC SERVICES IN SCOTLAND SCOTTISH LIB DEM LEADER WILLIE RENNIE DISAGREES
HE ALSO WANTS TO RAISE SCOTTISH TAX RATES WHAT WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM RUTH DAVIDSON
HE'S HAD A BACKING OF GEORGE OSBORNE'S TAX PLAN SHE WOULD FORGIVE A TAX CUT TO THE WEALTHIEST IN SOCIETY I WANT TO MAKE A TRANSFORMATIONAL INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION NOT JUST TO GIVE KIDS THE CHANCE IN LIFE OF THE DESERT
BUT ALSO TO GET THE ECONOMY WORKING AGAIN THAT'S WHY IT'S GOT A PENNY ON INCOME TAX FOR EDUCATION UKIP ANY P. DAVID COBURN BELIEVES RAISING INCOME TAX WOULD DAMAGE THE SCOTTISH ECONOMY WE DON'T WANT SCOTTISH TAXES TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE IN ENGLAND OR HIGHER AT ALL BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SCOTT STAYING IN SCOTLAND
BUILDING BUSINESSES AND EMPLOY THEIR FELLOW SCOTT FOR THE SCOTTISH GREENS PATRICK HARVEY SAYS TAXES WILL HAVE TO RISE TO PAY FOR PUBLIC SERVICES RUTH DOESN'T WANT A SIGN ON THE BORDER SAYING SCOTLAND IS CALLED FOR BUSINESS I DON'T WANT A SIGN ON THE BOARD I THINK SCOTLAND THE COUNTRY THAT TRASHES IT PUBLIC SERVICES THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE IT BETTER
IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE VOTERS ANYWHERE IN THE U.K. HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH SUCH A CHOICE OF DIFFERENT TAX POLICIES WITH SEVERAL PARTIES TRYING TO DEFY THE POLITICAL ORTHODOXY THAT SAYS VOTERS WILL NOT VOLUNTEER TO SEE THEIR TAX BILLS RISE
THE SELECTION WILL TEST THE IDEA THAT SCOTS ARE PREPARED TO PAY A BIT MORE IN RETURN FOR THE PROMISE OF BETTER PUBLIC SERVICES
IT WAS A SECOND EDITOR SARAH SMITH ON THE DEBATE LET'S TURN TO THE S.N.P. MACKAY WHO IS MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND ISLANDS AS WELL AS ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MONEY YOU HAVE BOTTLED IT ON TAX SEVENTY NO NOT AT ALL WITH THE NEW POWERS COME TO SCOTLAND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE USED WISELY AND CAREFULLY AND IN TUNE WITH THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND IN THE PAULING SUGGESTS TAX PROPOSITION IT BOTH AN INCOME TAX AND INDEED ON COUNCIL TAX IS IN TUNE
THEY'RE WORTH WHAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT US TO DO IT BECAUSE ON COMES JUST MAKE CLEAR TO COUNCIL TAX YOU'RE ALSO BEING ACCUSED OF BOTTLING IT ON COUNCIL TAX I COS YOU USED TO BE COMMITTED TO GETTING RID OF IT NOW YOU'RE NOT WELL IT'LL BE WHAT THEY'LL BE FEARED OR MORE PROGRESSIVE WE WILL GET ME YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND YOU WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO GET RID OF IT WHAT WAS WHAT WE COMMITTED TO LAST ELECTION MANIFESTO AND WHICH WERE JUDGED THIS WAS TO CONSULT ON HOW TO MAKE COUNCIL TAX WE HAD THAT MAJOR CONSULTATION AND WE KNOW THAT A PROPER SESSION WHERE WE RAISE REVENUE
ASK THOSE WITH THE MOST EIGHTY P. A LITTLE BIT MORE SAME FOR INCOME TAX OR CHANGES TO THE TAX THRESHOLD WILL ASK THOSE WORTH MORE TO PAY MORE TO GERMINATE MUCH NEEDED FUNDS FOR PUBLIC SERVICES BUT WE ABSOLUTELY I'M NOT GOING TO DO WHAT LABOUR AND THE LIBERALS WANT TO DO WHICH IS TAX EVERYBODY MORE TRANSFERRING THE BUGGED ANOTHER STEADY ON TO THE LESS WELL OFF KNOCK ON THE DRAW ON THE VERY WEALTHIEST WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT THE FIFTY P. RATE IT WHAT IS THE TRIGGER THAT WOULD BRING IN THE FIFTY P. RATE
IS THE ADDITION OF THE ISSUE IS THAT MANY OF US WOULD SUPPORT A HIGHER RATE THE REALITY YEARS WHO WOULDN'T RAISE REVENUE FROM IN SCOTLAND BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO TRANSFER
ELSE WE HAD A NICE POINTLESS TO HAVE THAT PRINCIPLE TO I'M HOPEFUL THAT WITCHES WITH THAT THEN RAISES THE QUESTION DOESN'T IT WHETHER THAT WOULD EVER NOT BE THE CASE IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN SO BASICALLY YOU'RE STUCK WITH WHATEVER THE HIGHEST RATE IS IN IMPOSED BY WEST NOT MY THEN YOU'LL START WITH WELL WE CAN LOOK AT THE END I LIKE THAT LOGIC YOU ARE WELL WELL WE CAN LOOK FOR BUT AT SOME OF THE ANALYSIS AND HOW
COULD BE CHANGED BY THE TRAY AT THE MOMENT TO SEE WHETHER ONE ACTUALLY READS THE REVENUE SO THERE'S NO POINT IN WINNING WOULD IT BUT YOU'VE GOT I THINK I THINK
THERE SHOULD BE A REFLECTION ON HEEL IS GEORGE OSBORNE'S CHOICES IN A U.K. BUDGET BUT IT'S THE WRONG THING TO DO FOR THE OTHER STICKING ON ON YOU THERE YOU ARE STUCK IS IT IT RAISES A WIDER QUESTION DOESN'T IT REALLY ABOUT THE LIMITS OF INDEPENDENCE BUT THAT THAT YOU ARE PRETTY MUCH STUCK AREN'T WE'VE GOT CLOSE TO ENGLAND AND WALES AND WITH THE THREAT THAT PEOPLE WOULD LEAVE IF YOU DID RAISE YOUR TAXI'S MORE WHICH YOU WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT ACTUALLY YOU CAN'T DO IT WE CAN TONGUE AND MORE DEEPLY TO OTHER TAX AND SPEND PROPOSITIONS IF WE HAD THE FILL LEAVE
OF INDEPENDENCE NO WE DON'T AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS ELECTION WILL BE A BOAT UP ABOUT THE NEW ABOUT THE LEVELS COMPTON GOVERNMENT FOR SCOTLAND HE'S THE BEST CHOICE TO FIRST START AND THEN I THINK WE'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD CANDIDATE IN THE CONSTRUCTION COMPETENT GOVERNMENT OR PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT OR YOUR LEFT WING PARTY BOTH A WIFE I FEEL THAT WE ARE LEFT OF CENTRE I FEEL THAT WE'VE BEEN DELIVERING PROGRESSIVE POLICIES SUCH AS AN N.H.S. FREE OF PRIVATISATION THERE LOVELY QUALITY
WITH THE BREAK UP INVESTMENT OVER THIRTEEN BILLION POUND PEOPLE POINT YOUR EDUCATION POLICY AND IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE POOR AND YOU LIVE IN SCOTLAND YOUR CHANCES OF GOING TO UNIVERSITY ARE QUITE A LOT WORSE THAN IF YOU'RE POOR AND YOU LIVE IN ONE IN THAT THEY SAY IS WRONG ABOUT WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT IT RES ATTAINMENT AND ADDRESS THE GAP IN HER SKILLS FIRST OF ALL BUT WITHOUT MONEY YOU'RE RAISING THROUGH TAX OUR STRONG TO SERIOUS WITHOUT MONEY AS WELL BECAUSE WE'VE ACTS REALLY IN THIS
MANIFESTO PROPOSE MORE RESOURCES FOR EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SERVICES THROUGH SOME OF THE TAX PROPOSITION CUP AND TALKING ABOUT BEING EDUCATION IT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE EDUCATION AND DEANO THEN SCOTLAND RIGHT NOW LET US NEVER WRECK AT THE MOMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN WORK EDUCATION OR TRAINING AND THAT SUGGESTS THAT POLICIES ARE WORKING NO OF COURSE I DO
BETWEEN THE LESS WELL OFF AND THE BETTER OFF IN TERMS OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND THAT'S WHY I'VE GOT NO GOT A SPECIFIC ATTAINMENT FUND TO TARGET RESOURCES TO THOSE VERY PEOPLE TO TRY AND GET FROM THE BASE STAR AND LIFE ARE CELEBRITIES GOING TO THE DEBT THAT IS STILL A COMMITMENT THAT WILL CHANGE WITH THE EXISTING AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU HAVE NO WE WE ARE WE ARE PROPOSING NEW MONIES TOWARDS PEACE PRIORITIES
AND IN TERMS OF EDUCATION WE'VE BEEN SPENDING MORE THAN REFER PUSHING AND BUILDING SKILLS AS WHALE AND REMAINED OF COURSE THAT WE TALK ABOUT EDUCATION THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE OPRY OUTCOME THAT WRECK AT THE MOMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN WHAT EDUCATION OR TRAINING IS A GOOD THING AND WE'VE BEEN REDUCING YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE IN HER BACK ON TODAY PROSPER SOME FIFTH THEATRE SOCIETY NICE TALK TO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SCOTTISH MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT MY LE DA MCKAY

THIS KIND OF THING IS UNHEARD OF IN CHINA A LETTER ADDRESSED FROM LOYAL COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS POSTED ON A NEWS WEBSITE WITH GOVERNMENT LINKS AND CALLING FOR THE CHINESE PRESIDENT SHE GIN PING TO RESIGN
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER IT'S AUTHENTIC OR WHETHER PERHAPS THE SITE WAS HACKED FROM OUTSIDE CHINA BUT THE POLICE APPEAR TO BE TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY A SOURCE AT THE WEBSITE HAS TOLD THE B.B.C.

COUNCILS ARE FACING BILLS TOTALLING ALMOST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS TO REPAIR DAMAGED TO INFRASTRUCTURE CAUSED BY THIS WENT TO US FLOODS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION IS NOW CALLING FOR FURTHER HELP FROM WHITEHALL WARNING THAT THE COST WILL RISE EVEN MORE
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS JUST ANNOUNCED AN EXTRA ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION POUNDS AND ASSISTANCE MORE FROM A U.K. AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT JEREMY KIRK WHILE LAST WINTER'S FLOODS CAUSED HUGE DAMAGE TO HOMES AND BUSINESSES INFRASTRUCTURE WAS ALSO BADLY HIT MANY ROADS AND BRIDGES WERE WASHED AWAY THE REPAIR WORK IS ONGOING
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION SAYS THAT CUMBRIA WAS THE WORST AFFECTED COUNCIL WITH DAMAGE AMOUNTING TO AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS IN CALDERDALE IN WEST YORKSHIRE THE FIGURE IS THIRTY THREE MILLION POUNDS AND IN NORTHUMBERLAND TWENTY FOUR MILLION
THE L.G. AYE SAYS COUNCILS NEED MORE FINANCIAL HELP AND IT'S CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO DEVOLVE MORE FLOOD DEFENCE FUNDING SO THAT COUNCILS RATHER THAN MINISTERS CAN DECIDE HOW IT'S SPENT
THERE IS ALSO A CORE TO ALLOW TAX CHARGED ON LANDFILL USE WHICH CAN INCREASE DRAMATICALLY AFTER FLOODING TO BE RETURNED TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES

IT'S BEEN CLAIMED THAT NEW LIP READING TECHNOLOGY COULD SOLVE CRIMES RESEARCHERS SAY IT CAN DECIPHER WHAT PEOPLE CAUGHT ON C.C.T.V. ARE SAYING AND ANOTHER SITUATIONS TO LIQUORICEY HAS MORE DETAILS
LIP READING AS WELL KNOWN TO PINPOINT EXPLETIVES USED BY FOOTBALLERS ON A PITCH BUT NOW VISUAL SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA SCIENTISTS SAY IT CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING IN PLACES WHERE AUDIO ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO HEAR SUCH AS ON SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE OR IN NOISY CARS AND AIRCRAFT COCKPITS AND THEY SAY THEIR TECHNOLOGY CAN TELL IF SOMEONE IS PRONOUNCING A P. OR A B. SOMETHING HUMAN LIP READERS HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH
THE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING IN CHINA
NICK KARI SHE REPORTING IT'S TEN PAST EIGHT FIRST IT WAS DAVID CAMERON'S MUM PROTESTING ABOUT COUNCIL CUTS IN HER SON'S CONSTITUENCY NOW THE CONSERVATIVE COUNCILLOR RESPONSIBLE FOR SCHOOLS IN THE PRIME MINISTER'S HOME PATCH IS OBJECTING TO HIS POLICY SHE SAYS SHE'S FED UP WITH DIKTATS FROM ABOVE SAYING YOU WILL DO THIS AND YOU WILL DO THAT WHAT'S UPSET HER THEN AND MANY OTHER CONSERVATIVES AROUND THE COUNTRY IT'S THE HEADLINE ANNOUNCEMENT MADE
BEFORE THE CHANCELLOR'S ILL FATED BUDGET THE PROPOSAL THAT ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD BECOME ACADEMIES IN ENGLAND IN OTHER WORDS LOCALLY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD LOSE ANY SAY THEY CURRENTLY HAVE ON HOW SCHOOLS ARE RUN IN A MOMENT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE SCHOOLS MINISTER FIRST THOUGH OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS HAS THIS REPORT
WE'RE GOING TO COMPLETE THE TASK OF SETTING SCHOOLS FREE FROM LOCAL EDUCATION BUREAUCRACY AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN THIS
THERE'S A POLITICAL PROBLEM WITH FREEING SCHOOLS FROM WHAT GEORGE OSBORNE CALLS LOCAL EDUCATION BUREAUCRACY BY TURNING THEM ALL INTO ACADEMIES THAT BUREAUCRACY IS TO MANY OF HIS FELLOW CONSERVATIVES THE DAILY WORK OF SUPPORTING THE LOCAL TEACHERS AND PUPILS
THOUGH CONSERVATIVES LIKE THE ONE I MET AT WARREN PARK PRIMARY IN HAVEN'T PETER EGO RESPONSIBLE FOR EDUCATION IN HAMPSHIRE IS AN UNHAPPY TORY
TO FORCE OR SCHOOLS WOULD BE RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE AND IN MY VIEW THE WRONG THING TO DO AND ALSO COULD CAUSE IN THE INTERIM A DROP IN STANDARDS IN ALL OUR SCHOOLS
HE DOESN'T STOP THEIR COUNCIL TAX COULD GO UP TO PAY FOR THE CHANGE SHE SAYS AND THERE'S A GRAVE RISK THAT SMALL RURAL PRIMARIES COULD PROVE UNVIABLE FOR ACADEMY CHAINS AND BE CLOSED THAT CONCERN IS ONE SHARED IN OTHER TORY SHIRES MELINDA TEAR THESE THE CABINET MEMBER FOR EDUCATION ON OXFORDSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL HER RESPONSIBILITIES COVER DAVID CAMERON'S CONSTITUENCY OF WHITNEY
IT MEANS A LOT OF LITTLE PRIMARY SCHOOLS WILL BE FORCED TO GO INTO MULTI ACADEMY TRUSTS AND I JUST FEEL IT'S THE WRONG TIME IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR A LITTLE PRIMARY SCHOOLS TO BE FORCED INTO DOING THIS AND EMMA I'M AFRAID THERE COULD BE A FEW LITTLE VILLAGE SCHOOLS THAT GET LOST IN ALL OF THIS IN YOU SOUND A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN YOUR GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY PUTTING IT VERY MILDLY
HOW WOULD YOU PUT IT I'M FED UP I'M FED UP WITH DIKTATS FROM ABOVE SAYING YOU WILL DO THIS AND YOU WON'T DO THAT THIS IS NOT WHY I BECAME A CONSERVATIVE
AND IN GREATER MANCHESTER THE TORY LEADER OR TRAFFORD COUNCIL SEAN ANSTEY QUESTIONS THE LOGIC OF RESTRICTING COUNCILLORS SAY OVER SCHOOLS EVEN AS THE AUTHORITIES THERE ARE GIVEN SWEEPING NEW POWERS OVER SO MUCH ELSE IN THEIR AREA
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WHEN YOU'RE TAKING CONTROL OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE PLANNING TRANSPORT CHILDREN SERVICES POST SIXTEEN SKILLS PROVISION IT APPEARS TO BE A BIT ODD THAT WE'RE NOT THEN TAKING OR HAVING THE ABILITY TO SHAPE AND INFLUENCE WHAT HAPPENS AT SCHOOL AGE
NONE OF THOSE COUNCILLORS OF COURSE HAVE A VOICE BACK HERE AT WESTMINSTER
BUT NORMALLY LOYAL CONSERVATIVE M.P.S HAVE TOLD ME THEY TOO WANT THE POLICY CHANGED ONE ARSE IF LOCAL SCHOOLS WERE GOOD WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU FORCE THEM TO BECOME ACADEMIES I COMMEND YOUR ANSWER BUDGET THE BOATS THE NEXT GENERATION
AS THE GOVERNMENT GETS ON WITH THE WORK IT SAYS WILL MAKE GOOD ON THAT PLEDGE SOME CONSERVATIVES ARE WORRIED ABOUT KEY PART OF THIS VISION FOR THE NEXT GENERATION WE'RE NOT FACING A FULL THROATED PARLIAMENTARY REBELLION NOT YET ANYWAY BUT RIGHT NOW CONCERN TORIES HAVE A KNACK FOR MAKING MINISTERS CHANGE THEIR MINDS
ROSS HAWKINS REPORTING THEN IT GAVE JOINS US IN THE STUDIO HE'S THE SCHOOLS MINISTER FOR ENGLAND THE MORNING TO YOU CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO A PARENT WITH A CHILD IN A PERFECTLY SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL HIGH PERFORMING SCHOOL WHY NO IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THEIR PARENTS THAN THE GOVERNOR'S THAN THE TEACHERS AND THE HEAD HOW IT SHOULD BE RUN
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD SCHOOLS IN EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY AND IN EVERY SCHOOL IN A LOCAL AUTHORITY AREAS EVENING GOOD LOCAL AUTHORITIES LIKE AUCH FOR SHOW WHICH YOU'VE JUST SIGHTED THERE ARE SCHOOLS THERE ARE NOT AS GOOD AS THE POPULAR SCHOOLS THE PARENTS WANT TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO KNOW IF YOU CAN GET A HEAD TEACHER WHO IS RUNNING A SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL TO IT TO HAVE THAT SCHOOL BECOME PART OF A MULTI ACADEMY TRUST WHERE HE CAN SPREAD THAT FOREMAN HE CAN USE HIS EXPERTISE
TO TAKE THE WINNING FORMULA THAT MADE HIS SCHOOL A SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL CHANGE WEAKER SCHOOLS INTO THE KIND OF SCHOOL THAT HE WAS LEADING THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE MULTI ACADEMY TRUST PROGRAMME NO THE ESSENCE IS THAT YOU ARE MINISTER THE MAN IN WHITEHALL SAYS TO THAT HEAD TEACHER FORGET WHAT YOU THINK
FORGET WHAT THE GOVERNORS THINK FORGET WHAT THE COUNCILLORS THING I KNOW BEST YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR STRUCTURE I HAVE DETERMINED IT NO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT WE WANT TO GIVE MORE AUTONOMY TO PROFESSIONALS LIKE THAT HEAD TEACHER TO RUN HIS OWN SHIP FREE FROM INTERFERENCE FROM THE LOCAL THOUGHT EXCEPT THE ONE THING YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY AUTONOMY ON AT ALL HE DID BUT FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS DECIDING WHETHER HE WANTS TO CHANGE HIS STATUS
I'M A COMING TO GET THEM ALL THERE ARE SIX YEARS THIS IS THEY PLAN FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS ALREADY SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF ALL SECONDARY SCHOOLS HAVE ACADEMY STATUS THIS FREEDOM OF FOR TOMMY FOR THAT SCHOOL FOR THOSE PROFESSIONAL RUNNING THAT SCHOOL AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF PRIMARY SCHOOL WE'RE LOOKING AHEAD FIVE SIX YEARS AND WE CAN SEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO POSITION EVEN ON CURRENT TRENDS WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCHOOLS ARE A CUT FROM IT SO WE CAN'T HAVE TWO SYSTEMS OR LOCAL AUTHORITY RUN SYSTEM AND A CABBIE RON SYSTEM SO THIS IS SAY WHAT'S IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN SIX SIX YEARS' TIME
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL IS AN ACADEMY AND WARRANTS A LITTLE FLICK TODAY YOU SEE USE WORDS YOU SAY FREEDOM YOU SAY AUTONOMY THIS WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS ARGUED ABOUT EDUCATION BUT THEN THE WOMAN HE WAS ACTUALLY IN CHARGE OF EDUCATION IN OXFORDSHIRE WHO RUNS THE SCHOOLS IN DAVID CAMERON'S CONSTITUENCY SHE SAYS THIS ISN'T ABOUT FREEDOM IT'S NOT ABOUT THE AUTONOMY IT'S ABOUT THE OPPOSITE IT IS ABOUT DIKTATS AND I QUOTE THAT IS NOT WHY I BECAME A CONSERVATIVE
NO IT'S NOT DIKTATS THIS IS ABOUT GIVING FREEDOM UNTIL DEVOLUTION BUT TO THE SCHOOL LEVEL AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS I WAS WITH HER MOVE THROUGH THIS ACADEMY WHICH INCIDENTALLY STARTED UNDER THE LAST LABOUR GOVERNMENT HE'S WITHIN ONE POINT FOUR MILLION MORE CHILDREN TODAY IN GOOD AND OUTSTANDING SCHOOLS THAN IN TWENTY TEN WE ARE SEEING MORE TROUBLE READING MORE EFFECTIVELY MORE TROUBLE KNOWING THE TABLES
BUT HER BEHAVIOUR IN A SCHOOL LET'S TAKE LOT THROUGHOUT IS BECAUSE OF THE THREE HUNDRED GIVEN TO SCHOOLS TO RUN THEIR OWN SHIP FORGIVE ME BUT THE CONTROVERSY IS ABOUT WHETHER YOU FOR SCHOOLS TO BICKER ACADEMY'S NOT HOW ALL SCHOOLS ARE DOING NOW YOU'LL BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS DOCUMENT AND WAVING AT THE STATISTICAL WORKING PAPER FROM YOUR OWN DEPARTMENT MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF SCHOOLS WITHIN ACADEMY CHAINS AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHAT DOES IT CONCLUDE THE MAJORITY OF FASTEST IMPROVING SCHOOLS ARE RUN BY WHOM
LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE TAKEN OUT OF LOCAL AUTHORITY SOME OF THEIR WORST PERFORMING SCHOOLS AND THEY BECOME ACADEMIES AND THEY'RE IMPROVING TUESDAY THOSE UNDER PERFORMING HAVE BEEN LANGUISHING FOR YEARS UNDER LOCAL AUTHORITY CONTROL WITHOUT IMPROVING CAN I JUST TELL YOU IT IS WHAT THAT STUDY SHAPED BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN OUT OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES THOSE WORST PERFORMING SCHOOLS SO YOU DECIDED TO IGNORE THE CONCLUSION OF THAT NO NO NO NO NO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT I CAN TAKE YOU TO SCHOOLS RUN BY MULTI ACADEMY TRUST LIKE THE HARRIS FEDERATION OR BY AAARGH
HAVE TAKEN SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPECIAL MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN LETTING CHILDREN DOWN YEAR AFTER YEAR AND WITHIN TWO OR THREE YEARS THEY TURN THEIR ESCORT INTO HIGHLY PERFORMING OUTSTANDING THAT'S THE MODEL THAT WE WANT TO SEE IN THOSE STATISTICS THAT YOU'VE CITED OF COURSE LOOK AT LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHERE WE HAVE ALREADY REMOVED THOSE WORST PERFORMING SCHOOLS AND WHAT'S LEFT OF COURSE WILL BE BEFORE ME BETTER THAN THEY WERE PERFORMING FOR THOSE CALLS YOU MENTION HIGHLY PERFORMING ACADEMIES AND VERY WELL RESPECTED CHANGE THAT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DISPUTES THAT HARRIS IS WELL RESPECTED ARC AS WELL
RESPECTED IT IS INTERESTING THOUGH THEY'RE ONLY OF THIS STUDY AGAIN FROM YOUR OWN DEPARTMENT THREE CHAINS WHERE THE FIGURES THE RESULTS HAVE IMPROVED FASTER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ALL OF THEM IN LONDON SO TO TAKE SOME EXAMPLES AND SAY BECAUSE IT WORKS WELL HERE WE WILL NOW COMPULSORILY FORCE
EVERY SCHOOL IN ENGLAND TO GO DOWN THE SAME ROUTE YOU'RE DOING IT WITHOUT EVIDENCE YOU DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S AN IDEOLOGICAL BUT NO THERE ARE MORE THAN THOSE CHAINS THERE'S OUTWOOD GRANGE THIRST INSPIRATION TRUST THIS IS AN EMERGING SYSTEM IT'S A NEW SYSTEM AND THESE MULTI ACADEMY TRUST ARE FORMING AND I CAN GIVE OTHER EXAMPLES IN THE EAST ANGLIAN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHERE MULTI ACADEMY TROTS HAVE TAKEN AREN'T FOR ME SCHOOL AND HAVE IMPROVED IT THAT CONTRASTS WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND
SCHOOLS RUN BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT ARE EITHER REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT ALL THEY'RE UNDER PERFORMING ALTHOUGH IN SPECIAL MEASURES THEY HAVE ONLY ISSUED NINETY THREE WARNING NOTICES TO THOSE SCHOOLS WE NEED MUCH MORE RAPID ACTION TO TACKLE UNDER PERFORMING EVERY LOCAL SCHOOL SHOULD BE AS POPULAR AS THE MOST POPULAR SCHOOL IN THE AREA WHEN DID YOUR JOINTS ON FIRST TELL YOU HE'S GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS HAS BEEN A PART OF OUR PLANS FOR FOR MANY YEARS WE SAID MANY A MESS ISN'T THAT YOU WON'T KNOW
WE SAID THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND ACADEMIES HIPPY I DIDN'T SAY YOU WOULD FORCE THE MYSTIC NO BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AHEAD AS I WAS SAYING IF YOU HAD SIX YEAR IS SIX YEARS TIME WE WILL BE IN A POSITION WHERE SOMETHING LIKE THREE QUARTERS ALL SCHOOLS WILL BE CAVERNS YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO SYSTEMS LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE ALMOST NO SCHOOLS TO RUN YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE CONSISTENT SYSTEM AND THIS SYSTEM IS RESULTING IN HIGHER ACADEMIC STANDARDS IN OUR SCHOOL YOU SEE I THINK PEOPLE ARE ASKING THEMSELVES THE QUESTION WHY WHY CHANGE POLICY TO FORCE THEM
IS IT BECAUSE YOU ANOTHER CONSERVATIVES HAVE LONG BEEN CRITICS OF WHAT YOU CALL THE EDUCATION ESTABLISHMENT MICHAEL GAVE USED TO CALL IT THE BLOB IS THIS ABOUT FINALLY BREAKING THE STRANGLEHOLD OF THE PEOPLE YOU THINK HAVE MESSED UP SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND SO LONG
IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A SCHOOL LED SYSTEMS OF THE PROFESSIONALS THE HEAD TEACHERS THE TEACHERS SENIOR TEACHERS THAT THEY'RE RUNNING A SCHOOL SYSTEM AND NOT LOCAL AUTHORITY AT ALL THOSE LOCAL AUTHORITY FIGURES IN THE CONSERVATORS ARE THEY PART OF THE EDUCATION ESTABLISHMENT YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM IS THANKS FOR ALL YOU DO BUT WE'RE GOING TO IGNORE YOU
THE TROUBLE IS RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE ARE LOCAL THOUGHT THERE ARE SOME STRONG LOCAL AUTHORITIES LIKE THE ONES YOU'VE SIGHTED BUT THERE ARE MANY WEAK LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AS RIGOUROUS ON ENSURING THAT UNDER PERFORMING SCHOOLS IMPROVE THE ACADEMIC STANDARDS OF THE OF THE CHILDREN THAN THEY SHOULD BE THE ACADEMY'S PROGRAMMES THAT MEANS WE HAVE SWIFT WE TAKE SWIFT ACTION WHEN SCHOOLS OR ACADEMIES ARE UNDER PERFORMING ONE LAST ONE FORGIVE ME IT'S GOT TO BE BRAVE BUT IT WAS RAISED EARLIER I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO ANSWER IT WAS SUGGESTED
ONE OF THE UNDERLYING REASONS IS THAT THIS BREAKS THE STRANGLEHOLD OF THE TEACHING UNIONS BECAUSE PAIN CONDITIONS WILL NO LONGER BE NEGOTIATED NATIONALLY IT WILL BE DONE SCHOOL BY SCHOOL WHICH IS REALLY WHAT YOUR AGENDA IS ALL ABOUT
IT'S NOT THE AGENDA THE GENDER IS IT TRUE THOUGH WHEN I DO IT WHEN YOU THINK IS THE AGENDA IS IT TRUE IT'S NOT YOU JERRY RESULT POINT ARE SADLY OF COURSE ACADEMIES DO HAVE FREEDOM OVER PAY AND CONDITIONS IT MEANS THEY CAN PAY TEACHERS MORE TO ATTRACT TEACHERS IN THOSE SHORTED SUBJECT BUT IN A TIME WHEN RECRUITING TEACHERS IS A CHALLENGE WITH A STRONG GROWING ECONOMY WITH A COMPETITIVE GRADUATE MARKET ACADEMIES ARE GOING TO WANT TO GET THE BEST TEACHERS IN AND THEY NEED THAT FLEXIBILITY TO PAY MORE NICK GIBB THANK YOU JOIN US
TIME TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT A FATHER AND A SON A JOURNEY THROUGH ADDICTION AND DISASTER FOR THE SUN OR RESCUE THEN MADE BY THEIR FATHER AND ALL OF IT CAPTURED IN A BOOK JACK SUTHERLAND WAS AN ALCOHOLIC AND HIS TEENS LATER BECAME A P.A. IN A BODYGUARD TO HOLLYWOOD STARS SUCH AS MICHAEL STIPE IS FATHER JOHN WAS PROUD OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS BUT WORRIED ABOUT HIS ADDICTION
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE TWO OF THEM ABOUT HOW IN ADULT LIFE PARENT RESCUES A CHILD
MY BELIEF IS THAT THE I'M AN ADDICT AND I WAS BORN AN ADDICT AND I CAN SEE WHERE THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOUR OR ADDICTION OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT HAS COME THROUGH TO MY LIFE AND AT MY WORST I WAS INCREDIBLY ADDICTED TO CRYSTAL METH AND G.H.B. WAS THE SLANG TERM IS SLAMMING SO INJECTING CRYSTAL METH AND WAS ALSO SMOKING IT ON ON A DAILY GONNA BASIS FROM THE MINUTE I WAKE UP TO WHEN I GO TO SLEEP AND JOHN WHEN YOU INTERVENED
WHAT HAPPENED IT'S VERY DIFFICULT I MEAN MY FEELING IS THAT FAMILIES WORK COS WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT EACH OTHER WE DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT OUR PARENTS MAKING LOVE WHICH MADE US THAT'S JUST TOO EMBARRASSING THE DRAMATIST HENRIK IBSEN JACK IS VERY DEEPLY INTO IT YOU CALL THEM LIFELINE IS NO MEASURES ACTUALLY GO AROUND HIM AS GEORGE ELIOT LITERARY KIND OF CRITIC WELL WADDED WITH STUPIDITY TAKE AWAY THAT STUPID YOU KNOW WHAT
WHAT IS ACTUALLY THERE AND OTHER PERSON'S LIFE AND HAS IT'S BOTH TERRIBLE AND YET AT THE SAME TIME YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO DO IT IT WAS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES COS YOU JACK
WAS AS ADDICTS ARE AT TIMES EXPLOITATIVE AT TIMES RUTHLESS BUT ABOVE ALL INCREDIBLY SELFISH AND SELF CENTRED WHICH IS WHAT ADDICTION DOES YOUR OWN UNIVERSE BUT I LOVE THE GUY HE'S HE'S VERY GOOD INSIDE AND THAT'S WHAT I HELD ON TO IT SO WHAT BROUGHT YOU BACK JACK
I DIDN'T THINK I WAS AN ADDICT I THOUGHT THAT I COULD CONTROL MY ADDICTION AND IF YOU THINK YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR ADDICTION IT FLOURISHES IT WAS A VERY SIMPLE THE CHANGE WAS I ACKNOWLEDGED OR I ACCEPTED THAT I AM AN ADDICT AND THAT I WAS BORN AN ADDICT AND WILL ALWAYS BE AN ADDICT THE DIFFERENCE TODAY IS I'M AN ADDICT IN RECOVERY SO I'M NOT STUCK IN A LIFE OF ACTIVE ADDICTION I'M NOT PRACTISING A BITCH JOHN DID HAVE YOU SEPARATED YOURSELF FROM WHAT
JACK DID AND FROM THE CRISIS THAT HIS LIFE FACED IN OTHER WORDS DID YOU FEEL GUILTY AT THE TIME DO YOU NOW I IN JACK'S BED TO CRITICISMS OF BEING AS A FATHER THE FIRST WAS THAT FOR THE FIRST NINE YEARS OF HIS LIFE I WAS A VERY DESTRUCTIVE ALCOHOLIC MYSELF THERE IS THAT KIND OF FIRM IN BROTHERHOOD END
PARENTAL SON RELATIONS THERE WAS THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT WRITING ABOUT I MEAN JACK IS ILLITERATE NUMERATE DYSLEXIC AND I THINK HE'S READ ABOUT THREE BOOKS NOT INCLUDING THE ONE WHICH IS IN A SENSE ROACH YOU HE'S VERY FLUENT AND WET WITH WORK BUT I'M AFRAID IT ALL AS I WAS THE INVISIBLE HAND EXCEPT NOT SO INVISIBLE SO I REALLY HAD TO DISTANCE MYSELF STYLISTICALLY FROM WHAT I WAS DOING WELL KEEPING THE QUALITY OF HIS VOICE AND HIS WONDERFUL RACONTEUR MUCH BETTER STORYTELLER THAN I AM
BUT HE'S NOT TOO HOT ON THE POLISH SYLLABLES HE'S NOT TOO HOT ON STYLE IS NOT TOO HOT ON SYNTAX THINGS WELL YOU'VE BOTH LEARNT FROM IT JACK I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY REFLECTING ITS BEEN ABLE TO ME TO LOOK BACK AT TIMES IN MY LIFE AND I LOOK BACK ON THEM WITH REGRET I UNFORTUNATELY DON'T LIKE WHO I WAS PRIOR TO GETTING SOBER THIS TIME I WASN'T A GOOD PERSON IT'S REMINDED ME HOW SELFISH I WAS AS A PRACTISING AT IT
IS THERE A LESSON IN THE BOOK JOHN FOR PARENTS WHO FIND THEMSELVES TRYING TO COPE WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE GONE OFF THE RAILS AND MAYBE NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT JACK DID BUT NEVER THAT HAS GONE OFF THE RAILS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO PULL THEM BACK WELL I SUPPOSE IN FACT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF REMEDIES AND THERAPIES PHARMACEUTICAL PSYCHOANALYTICAL CONSCIOUSNESS WROTE BUT THE MAIN THING I THINK IT HONESTLY
THE BEST YOU CAN DO IF YOUR CHILDREN BEST THING HER CHILDREN CAN DO FOR YOU USED TO BE HONEST ABOUT EACH OTHER IT'S NOT EASY HER OWN AS MUCH EASIER TO LIVE IN A WORLD OF LIVES IN A WORLD OF HONESTY BUT THE THING ABOUT ADDICTION IS IT REALLY DOES TAKE YOU TO THE EDGE AND YOU EITHER NEAR YOU LOOK OVER INTO THE INTO THE DARKNESS SO YOU COME BACK JACK HAS COME BACK I THINK YEAH WITH A SENSE OF THE PRECARIOUS NURSE I MEAN YOU NEVER RECOVER IN A SENSE
IT'S A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY BUT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU JUST CUFF ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE I WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER IF I COULD LIVE IN A MYTHIC WORLD SO THE KIND OF WORLD I USED TO THINK IF IN FAMILIES WERE WELL AS WELL IS ALL SET OUT AND STARS CARS AND CRYSTAL METHS JACK SALA LYNDON JOHNSON AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH

WELL WEATHER NOT BAD IN FACT LARGELY DRY AND FINE THROUGHOUT THE DAY YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR JUSTIN WEBB AND NICK ROBINSON IT IS HALF THE STATE TIME FOR A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM KATHY CLARKSTON OFFICIALS IN BRUSSELS SAY SIX PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN RAIDS LINKED TO THE BOMBINGS AT THE CITY'S AIRPORT UNDER METRO STATION THE IDENTITIES OF THE SUSPECTS ON SHE HAD KNOWN THIRTY ONE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN TUESDAY'S TERROR ATTACKS AND AROUND SIXTY REMAIN IN A CRITICAL CONDITION IN HOSPITAL
THE AUTHORITIES AND FRANCE SAY A FRENCHMAN WHO WAS IN THE ADVANCED STAGES OF A PLAN TO ATTACK THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN DETAINED POLICE SAY THEY FIND EXPLOSIVES DURING A RAID ON A BLOCK OF FLATS IN THE NORTH WESTERN SUBURB OF PARIS REPORT SAYS THE MAN WAS CONVICTED LAST SUMMER IN BELGIUM IN HIS ABSENCE OF BEING PART OF A JIHADIST NETWORK AT THE SAME TIME AS THE RINGLEADER OF THE PARIS ATTACKS FOUR MONTHS AGO
SEVERAL SENIOR CONSERVATIVE COUNCILLORS HAVE CRITICISED THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO TURN EVERY STATE SCHOOL IN ENGLAND INTO AN ACADEMY THEY INCLUDE THE CABINET MEMBER FOR EDUCATION AND OXFORDSHIRE WHICH COVERS DAVID CAMERON'S CONSTITUENCY THE SCHOOLS MINISTER NICK GIBB TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT FREEING SCHOOLS FROM LOCAL AUTHORITY INTERFERENCE WOULD IMPROVE STANDARDS
AT LEAST TWENTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DETAINED IN CHINA FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF HER LETTER CALLING ON PRESIDENT SHE GIN PING TO RESIGN THE LETTER WAS POSTED ONLINE EARLIER THIS MONTH BUT WAS QUICKLY DELETED BY THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES
THANK YOU HE'S TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE WE'VE HAD A STARK DISAGREEMENT IN RECENT DAYS ABOUT WHETHER WE WOULD BE MORE OR LESS VULNERABLE TO TERRORISM IN BRITAIN IF BRITAIN LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE FORMER BOSS OF M.I. SEX SAYING THE COST OF A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD BE LOW AND COULD RESULT IN SECURITY GAINS THE FORMER G.C.H.Q. BOSS DAVID HOME AND DISAGREEING HE SAID BRITAIN HAD THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS BY STAYING IN REMAINING PART OF AN ESTABLISHED
INFORMATION SHARING NETWORK WHILE STILL RETAINING CONTROL OF THE BORDER FOR THE HEAD OF THE C.I.A. JOINS THE DEBATE THIS MORNING GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN DID THAT JOB JOE AND GEORGE BUSH'S PRESIDENCY IT ALSO BEEN HEAD OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY SAY HAS AN INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DAY TO DAY BUSINESS OF INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND SHARING SOMETHING HE'S BEEN TELLING ME THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND BELGIUM HE'S NOT VERY WELL SET UP TO DO
NATIONAL SECURITY REMAINS A NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SO SADLY THE GRADES YOU HAVE TO GIVE TO EACH OF THE SERVICES ARE FRANKLY INDIVIDUAL AND IT'S VERY UNEVEN VERY GOOD SERVICES AGGRESSIVE SERVICES IN FRANCE GREAT BRITAIN GOOD BUT SMALL SERVICES AND SCANDINAVIA
AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE REST OF THE CONTINENT A SMALL SERVICES IN A FEW TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT BELGIUM SMALL
UNDER RESOURCED LEGALLY OR LIMITED AND FRANKLY WORKING FOR A GOVERNMENT THAT ITSELF HAS ITS OWN CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF OVERALL GOVERNMENTS
THE FORMER HEAD OF M.I.SIX HAS SAID HE DOESN'T THINK IT WOULD AFFECT OUR SECURITY MUCH IN THIS COUNTRY IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION DO YOU THINK HE'S RIGHT NOW THAT SETS RICHARD DEARLOVE AND I THINK SIR RICHARD IS RIGHT BECAUSE OF THIS DIVISION OF LABOUR I DON'T MEAN TO BE ARGUING AGAINST THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT BUT WITH REGARDS TO THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS
THESE THE UNION IS NOT A NATURAL CONTRIBUTOR TO NATIONAL SECURITY OF EACH OF THE ENTITY STATES AND IN FACT IN SOME WAYS GETS IN THE WAY OF THE STATES PROVIDING SECURITY
FOR ITS OWN CITIZENS
SO IN THE VIEW OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH UPSET IF BRITAIN WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THAT THAT SIMPLE POINT ABOUT INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND INTELLIGENCE SHARING YOU YOU DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON ON OUR ABILITY TO DO THOSE THINGS AND OUR SAFETY
JUST AS YOU COULD FIND THE PROBLEM PUTTING ALL THE OTHER QUESTIONS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WITH YOUR GRUDGE OF THIS THE SPECIFIC LINE OF NATIONAL SECURITY I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK SIR RICHARD IS RIGHT IT WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH AFFECT CERTAINLY ON THE AMERICAN ABILITY TO CO OPERATE WITH NACIONAL
SECURITY SERVICES WHICH AGAIN MAINTAIN KEEP THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY I'VE SEEN IS SUGGESTED THE EUROPEAN SECURITY SERVICES HAVE HAD A GREATER TENDENCY SOMETIMES TO CO OPERATE ACTUALLY WITH THE UNITED STATES AND THEY LOVE EACH OTHER
THERE YOU ARE MY LIFE EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT THAT IS TRUE KNOW WHAT I UNDERSTAND WE ARE WE ARE A BIG NATIONAL SECURITY EDGES ARE HERE IN NORTH AMERICA
AND THERE WE ARE VERY POWERFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL OF OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS AND THERE'S A NATURAL TENDENCY NOT JUST BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN WITH ALL OF ITS STRUGGLE TIES GOING BACK TO BLETCHLEY PARK AND THE LIKE BUT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE OTHER CONTINENTAL SECURITY SERVICES FOR THEM TO BE MORE FORTHCOMING WITH US THAN THEY ARE WORTH ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE BECAUSE FRANKLY WE'RE ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD INVESTMENT
WERE YOU GE SECURITY SERVICE IN EACH SEES THEIR NATIONAL INTEREST AS BEING WELL SERVED BY HAVING A PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND FRANKLY THE SAME MAYOR DOES NOT APPLY
OTHER SERVICES ON THE CONTINENT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S REACTION TO WHAT HAPPENED IN BRUSSELS BECAUSE HE WAS CRITICISED BY SOME WASN'T HE FOR CARRYING ON WITH HIS SCHEDULE HE WENT TO A BASEBALL CUBA ANY PLEDGE HE DANCED THE TANGO AND ARGENTINA WHAT DO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE REACTION WELL I MEAN IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION
BUT YOU'VE ASKED JUSTIN SO THERE'S MY CHICK A FRANKLY I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS A VIEW
THAT MUCH OF THE AMERICAN REACTION TO THESE KINDS OF THAT'S IS FRANKLY AN OVERREACTION THERE LET THAT HE VIEWS THAT AS BAD A PROBLEM AS TERRORISM EARS THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES FRANKLY MORE IMPORTANT IN THE WORLD
HE'S GOING TO A BASEBALL GAME BETWEEN CUBA AND THE UNITED STATES WASN'T SO MUCH A MISSED STEP OR AN GIRL OR A MISTAKE OR AN INDIFFERENCE TO WHAT HAPPENS IN BRUSSELS
IT WAS ACTUALLY A MATTER OF POLICY AND IF YOU WILL MAYBE EVEN A SENSE OF MESSAGING TO THE AMERICAN POPULATION THAT THIS MIGHT NOT BE AS BIG A PROBLEM AS YOU THINK IT IS THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES IN THE WORLD THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT AND I WILL BE ATTENDING TO THEM THAT I FRANKLY DISAGREE STRONGLY WITH THAT VIEW
BUT IT'S ONLY A RATIONAL POINT OF VIEW FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THE PRESIDENT IT'S JUST HIS YOU I SUPPOSE YOU COULD I ASK THE QUESTION COULDN'T YOU WOOD WOOD WOOD SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE PREFER TO SEE PRESIDENT OBAMA SCURRYING AROUND LOOKING WORRIED OR WOULD THEY PREFER TO SAME DANCING THE TANGO AND ACTUALLY IT'S THE FORMER THEY'D PREFER ISN'T IT OH NO I I I'M NOT TRYING TO BE CRITICAL HERE I'M JUST TRYING TO BE DESCRIPTIVE I GET IT
I ACTUALLY THINK HE WANTS TO DENY THIS ENEMY THAT THAT THAT IMAGE
OF VICTORY ABLE OF AMERICAN PANIC OVER THEIR ATTACK BUT I ALSO THINK THERE'S AN UNDERLYING BELIEVES THAT HE HAS THAT THERE ARE INDEED OTHER ISSUES MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS I FRANKLY DISAGREE WITH THE LATTER BUT I UNDERSTAND IT
GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THANK YOU JUSTIN AND LET US TURN TO PHILIP TO BAKKER WHO IS BELGIAN MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TAKES A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN INTELLIGENCE MATTERS AND IS ON THE LINE A GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT MICHAEL
FIRST OF ALL I THINK I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH HIM I THINK THAT HE IF HE WOULD BE FACED IN UNITED STATES WITH SEPARATE INTELLIGENCE AND POLICING SERVICES FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS THE STATE OF FLORIDA ARIZONA NOT CAROLINA HE WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE TO CALL FOR A CENTRALISED AGENCY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN UNITED STATES MUST GO FROM THAT WITH ORGANISED CRIME AND TERRORISM IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THEY STARTED THE F.B.I. THIS AND AFTER THE ATTACKS ON NINE ELEVEN THAT EVEN WITH AN ADDITIONAL OVERHAUL OF THEIR SECURITY SERVICES YOU'VE BEEN GIVING MORE POWER OF THE CENTRALISED LEVEL
SO I THINK THAT YOU ALSO SEE HERE IN THE EUROPEAN HE SAYS THAT THE FRAGMENTATION OF WHICH THESE TERRORIST OR NOT CONCERNED TO DOT THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH BORDERS NOT A CONCERT BUT NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY THEY'RE TRYING TO STRIKE IN THE HEART OF EUROPE IN PARIS IN LONDON IN MADRID AND RUSSELL AND IF YOUR AIM THEN IS TO BRING THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES TOGETHER TO CENTRALISED TO SOME EXTENT WHAT THEY DO AND CERTAINLY TO SHARE INFORMATION MUCH MORE QUICKLY IN WHETHER BRITAIN IS IN THAT OR OUTSIDE THAT FORMAL STRUCTURE PRESUMABLY MATTERS QUITE A LOT
IT WAS QUITE A LOT WHEN INTO DOESN'T FOURTEEN U.K. GOVERNMENT OPTED OUT OF THE JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS CHAPTERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE NEXT DAY THEY ALREADY RICK THE SOUND UP AGAIN FOR THIRTY FIVE OF THOSE ELEMENTS INCLUDING EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT ANY REPORT FOR EXAMPLE SO I THINK ALSO THE U.K. GOVERNMENT UNDERSTANDS OF BEING PARK OVER OF A CENTRALISED AND MORE EUROPEAN ORGANISED INTELLIGENCE SERVICE DOES HAVE ITS BENEFITS
IN SHARING INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PEOPLE THAT THE ARGUMENT WE'RE HERE IS THAT ACTUALLY WE COULD PERFECTLY WELL BE PART OF THAT WITHOUT BEING PART OF THE ER OPINION
I DIDN'T JUST THROUGH THAT I THINK THAT WE ARE WE TURNING POINT I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE OF THIS FRAGMENTATION IN TWENTY DIFFERENT INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE INFORMATION SHOWING BETWEEN DOGS INFORMATION SERVICES HAS NOT BEEN ALWAYS UP TO SPEED TO SUDDENLY NOT BEING IN A STRUCTURAL WAY AND THEREFORE WE OFTEN SEE THAT AFTER ATTACKS MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMMITTING THESE ATROCITIES ARE OR WERE IDENTIFIED IN NANTES AUTHORITIES BUT WERE NOT FOLLOWED UP OR INFORMATION WAS NOT SHARED SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
BUT THEY DO IT IS FROM THERE I WANT IN A MUCH MORE STRUCTURAL WEIGHT THROUGH YOUR ALL THROUGH YOU WERE JUST BUT ALSO BY STRENGTHENING AND GETTING MORE RESOURCE STOOD HIS EUROPEAN ORGANISATION BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE THIS KIND OF HELICOPTER VIEW TO DISMANTLE THESE NETWORKS TO PUT ALL THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE TOGETHER AND HAVE POLICE WORK ON THEM AND PREVENT THIS KIND OF AT THAT HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT HELICOPTER VIEW CAN BE GAINED IN REASONABLE ORDER WITHIN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME
I THINK THAT MANY OF US IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAVE ALREADY CALLED FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOR THIS KIND OF INTELLIGENCE AND POLICE AND IT HASN'T HAD SOMETHING UP AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF MISTRUST BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES BUT I THINK THAT THE CONCEPT OF THE OLD GOSSIP OF SOVEREIGNTY WHERE IT'S A NATIONAL SECURITY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT EUROPEAN UNION WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE HAVE TO COME TO A SHARED SOVEREIGNTY WHERE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE BETTER OFF WHEN WE SHARE THE SCANNER SEVENTY TOGETHER WHEN WE SHARE INFORMATION AND WE POOL OUR RESOURCES
PHILIP TOBACCO BELGIAN MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT FROM THE ALLIANCE OF LIBERALS AND DEMOCRATS FOR YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE GIVEN THE DEPTH AND THE VENOM OF THE ROW BETWEEN IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AND GEORGE OSBORNE IT'S EASY TO FORGET FORGET WHAT TRIGGERED IT PROPOSALS TO CUT THEIR DISABILITY BENEFIT KNOWN AS THE PIP PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT ON THE PROGRAMME ON TUESDAY WE SPOKE TO THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR KEN CLARKE WHO DEFENDED PLANS WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW ABANDONED
THEY'VE BEEN PAYING FOR EXTRA COSTS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INCURRING EXTRA COSTS BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY GOT THINGS PAID FOR THAT THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY MANY OF THEM DIDN'T ACTUALLY NEED AT ALL SOMEBODY IF YOU HADN'T APPLIANCE YOU WERE REGARDED AS HAVING EXTRA COSTS AND A VERY GOOD CIVIL SERVANT CALLED PAUL GRAY STUDDED IT AND FOUND NINETY PER CENT OF THEM DIDN'T HAVE EXTRA COST
THAT PROVOKED ONE OF OUR LISTENERS ISABEL KNEW TH TO WRITE THIS ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE
BRITISH POLITICS HAS BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN OVER A WELFARE BENEFITS CUT THAT NOBODY IN THE PUBLIC EYE APPEARS TO UNDERSTAND THE CLEVER MY KEN CLARKE WAS ALLOWED TO SAY THAT THE COUNCIL CUT TO PIP WAS ACTUALLY JUSTIFIED BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BEING PAID WEEKLY FOR SOMETHING THAT'S A ONE OFF EXPENSE NO
AWARDING POINTS TOWARDS PIP ELIGIBILITY TO PEOPLE WHO NEED CERTAIN AIDS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO REFLECT THE COST OF THE AIDS THE NECESSITY FOR AIDS IS USED AS A BENCHMARK
AS TO THE PERSON'S LEVEL OF DISABILITY IT'S A GUIDE AS TO THE EXTRA OTHER COSTS THAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO HAVE LIKE EXTRA HEATING COSTS BECAUSE OF LACK OF MOBILITY THE COST OR OTHERWISE OF THE AID
IS QUITE IRRELEVANT SO WHO IS RIGHT COULD BE BOTH BE A BIT RIGHT LET'S DISCOVER WILL MOY IS THE DIRECTOR OF FULL FACT AND INDEPENDENT FACT CHECKING CHARITY YOU BETTER START WITH HOW THIS PAYMENT WORKS SO WE CAN THEN DISENTANGLE CLAIMS OH KAY SO PITCHES THE PAYMENT THAT IS MEANT TO HELP PEOPLE WITH THE EXTRA COST THEY HAVE BECAUSE THEY'RE DISABLED OR BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN ILL FOR A LONG TIME
SO IT'S NOT ABOUT WHETHER YOUR OWN WORK OR NOT IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW RICH YOU ARE IT'S JUST EXTRA TOP UP BECAUSE YOU GET EXTRA COST AND YOU GET IT IF YOUR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES ARRIVE A LIMITED OR SEVERELY LIMITED BY YOUR PHYSICAL OR MENTAL CONDITION THAT'S THE TEST THAT'S WHAT'S IN LAW AND SAY THE LIST NOW ISABEL IS RIGHT TO SAY THE MONEY YOU GET IS NOT FOR THE AIDS NOT FOR WHAT YOU KNOW THE HELP YOU NEED BUT THE AIDS ARE SEEN AS A SORT OF BENCHMARK ABOUT WHETHER YOU NEED CASH AT ALL
YES THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND CLIPPERS FOR REALLY CONTROVERSIAL THING KEN CLARKE SAID THAT IF YOU HAD AN APPLIANCE YOU WERE REGARDED AS HAVING EXTRA COSTS AND AS I SAID THE THRESHOLD IS ACTUALLY ARE YOU LIMITED IN WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO DEFINE HOW ON EARTH DO WE TEST THAT AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THEY'VE COME UP WITH A LIST OF THINGS YOU MIGHT TRY TO DO DAY TO DAY WHETHER IT'S HAVING A CONVERSATION OR GOING TO THE TOILET OR GETTING DRESSED AND UNDRESSED
AND THEREFORE THE THE USE OF THE DAY THE PROVISION OF A DATE MAY BE SEEN AS A CROSSING THAT BENCHMARKS WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT EXACTLY SO THAT THIS IS YOU GET POINTS BASICALLY SO IF YOU'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION YOU DON'T NEED ANY HELP YOU DON'T GET ANY POINTS IF YOU NEED SOME KIND OF AID TO HAVE A CONVERSATION LIKE A HEARING AID THEN YOU MIGHT GET TWO POINTS FOR THAT
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION WHATEVER HELPS YOU MIGHT GET TWELVE POINTS YOU HAVE TO GET EIGHT POINTS IN TOTAL TO GET ANY KIND OF BENEFIT OUT OF HER SYSTEM SO THE LISTENER IS RIGHT THAT IT'S A BENCHMARK THE KEN CLARKE IS EFFECTIVELY SAYING IS NEAR THE GOVERNMENT WORSE IT'S A RUBBISH BENCH BLOCK IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN OFTEN HAVE PEOPLE WHO GET THESE EXTRA EXTRA BITS OF HELP AND THEY DON'T HAVE EXTRA COSTS THAT SHOULD BE SUBSIDISED BY THE STATE
ISABELLA'S EXACTLY RIGHT THAT THESE THESE COSTS OF THAT THESE ASSESSMENTS ARE NOT SAYING DO YOU HAVE EXTRA COST BECAUSE YOU ARE USING THE SIDE THEY ARE SAYING DOES THE FACT YOU USE SAY SIDE OFFERS SOME EVIDENCE FOR YOU HAVE EXTRA COST MORE GENERALLY
KEN CLARKE IS POINTING OUT THAT ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS REACHED THE CONCLUSION BUT IT'S ASSESSMENTS STATE EFFECTIVELY ASSESS WHETHER PEOPLE ARE DISABLED AND IRONICALLY DISABLED PEOPLE TEND TO AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT BUT FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION ANYTHING ABOUT THE TRUTH IS NEVER SIMPLE BUT YOU'VE MADE IT AS CLEAR AS YOU POSSIBLY COULD THANK YOU
THE TIMES QUOTED AN IRON HE'S DONALD TRUMP DEFINITELY GOING TO BE THE NEXT REPUBLICAN PARTY CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY THE ANSWER OF COURSE IS NO HE DOESN'T YET HAVE THE NUMBER OF STATE DELEGATES THAT WOULD SEE HIM HOME AND DRY BUT HE IS QUITE LIKELY TO GET TO THE PARTY CONVENTION IN THE SUMMER WITH CERTAINLY THE BIGGEST NUMBER SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN A BUN FIGHT TO END ALL BUN FIGHTS HE'S PROMISED A CONTESTED CONVENTION OF THE KIND THAT THEY HAVEN'T HAD FOR SOME TIME THOUGH OF COURSE ONCE UPON A TIME IT USED TO HAVE QUITE OFTEN GEMMA'S BEEN LOOKING THROUGH THE ARCHIVES

GERRY FORD THE SITTING PRESIDENT AGAINST GOVERNOR RONALD REAGAN AND THE DELEGATE COUNT ALMOST TIED NO WHEN YOU COULD GET IT IT TURNED OUT THAT THE MISSISSIPPI DELEGATIONS SPECIAL TRIP TO THE WHITE HOUSE HAD DONE THE TRICK
GOODBYE NOMINATE YOUNG GUY
BUT IT LED TO DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OF JIMMY CARTER AS REAGAN ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD AND HE BIDED HIS TIME
IT'S JUST ONE BAD OR IMAGINE A LONG WAR IT WAS GOING TO GO ON AS LONG AS WE ARE
SHE AND I WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND SIMILAR I CAN SHARE MY FRONT PORCH AND SAY WELL THAT'S ALL FOR US NO ONE HAD KNOWN A CONVENTION LIKE IT AT LEAST SINCE NINETEEN FORTY
IN THE MAMA DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M GOING OUT I KNOW THE ONLY PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS WOULD NEVER HELD POLITICAL OFFICE OR HIGH MILITARY RANK ALTHOUGH THAT'S ALL THAT WENDELL WILKIE HAD IN COMMON WAS DONALD TRUMP HE TOOK THE PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION BY STORM AND TURNED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY UPSIDE DOWN IN FOUR DAYS
BUT THAT HARDLY EVER HAPPENS
JOHN F. KENNEDY ARRIVED IN LOS ANGELES WITHOUT HER FIRST BALLET MAJORITY AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN NINETEEN SIXTY LYNDON JOHNSON AND THE NOMINEE TWICE BEFORE ADLAI STEVENSON TRIED TO STOP HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T FORCE HER SECOND BALLOT WHEN I READ THE BACON THEN WITH ONLY ONE ARM
MY BACON GOOD ABODE EVERY EFFORT ON MY MIND
A PARTY BACK A BIT ME AND I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BREAK THE PATTERN
SENATOR TED KENNEDY THE YOUNGEST BROTHER TRIED TO DERAIL JIMMY CARTER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND FELL FAR SHORT HE'S CONVENTION DRAMA COMING NOT IN THEIR VOTES BUT IN A SPEECH WHICH NO ONE WHO WAS THERE AND MADISON SQUARE GARDEN WILL EASILY FORGET
FOR ME A FEW HOURS AGO
THIS CAMPAIGN CAME TO AN END FOR ALL THOSE WHOSE CARES HAVE BEEN OUR CONCERN THERE WERE
THE CORRS INDOORS THERE HOPE STILL LIVES AND THE DREAM SHALL NEVER DIE
THAT'S WHAT CONVENTIONS HAVE USUALLY BEEN ABOUT A MEMORABLE SPEECH A MOMENT OF INSPIRATION A TOUCH OF HUMAN DRAMA WHEN THE REPUBLICANS MEET IN CLEVELAND AND JULY WHY SHOULD IT BE DIFFERENT
MAYBE BECAUSE OF THIS MAN THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD
BUT IF I GET ELECTED PRESIDENT I WILL BRING IT BACK DONALD TRUMP IS DIFFERENT HE'S TAPPED INTO THE ANGER AMONG MANY VOTERS AND HE'S RIDING THAT TIDE BUT THE ANTIPATHY AMONG OTHER REPUBLICANS IS INTENSE HE'S BEEN CALLED A FRAUD A CON MAN A BULLY A RACIST A MISOGYNIST
VULGAR COARSE AND ACCORDING TO THE LAST NOMINEE MITT ROMNEY SIMPLY UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT HIS OPPONENT'S CANNOT NOW STOP HIM GOING TO CLEVELAND WITH MORE DELEGATES THAN ANYONE ELSE
BUT BY THE TIME THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARIES OVER IN EARLY JUNE THEY HOPE THEY MAY HAVE DENIED HIM HER FIRST BALLET MAJORITY AND THEN
WHERE YOU KNOW ONE HUNDRED INWARD AND WE'RE AT ELEVEN HUNDRED ZUMBA
I MIGHT BE THERE FOR A GOOD CAUSE WE'RE WAY AHEAD OF EVERY
SAVE IT WE DON'T GET IT AUTOMATICALLY I THINK IT WOULD BE
THEY THINK THAT IF HE HASN'T SECURED ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DELEGATES COMMITTED TO HIM BEFORE HE GOES TO CLEVELAND ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN
HISTORY'S AGAINST THEM BUT AS TRUMP MARCHES ON THEY STILL HOPE
THAT WAS JIM LUCKY JIM LOOKING AHEAD TODAY'S FASCINATING CONVENTIONS IT IS NOW NINE MINUTES TO NINE THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS FROM BELGIUM THIS MORNING THAT ELEVEN NUCLEAR WORKERS HAVE HAD THEIR WORK PASSES REVOKED AMID FEARS THAT THE BRUSSELS BOMBERS WERE PLOTTING TO BUILD A RADIOLOGICAL DIRTY BOMB
A SENIOR BELGIUM NUCLEAR INDUSTRY EMPLOYEE WAS SECRETLY FILMED BY JIHADISTS LATE LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR AUTHORITY AN OFFICIAL TOLD THE TIMES WHEN YOU START FILMING SOMEONE IN THE WAY THEY DID THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS THEY WANTED TO ABDUCT THAT PERSON AND TO OBTAIN RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL WELL IF THEY DID WHAT COULD THEY DO WITH IT AND IS THIS MORE ALARMING THAN IT NEED BE
WE'RE JOINED BY DOCTOR MARTIN NAVY'S RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AND THE SCENT OF A DEFENCE STUDIES AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON MORNING TO YOU EVEN IF TERRY'S WERE SUCCESSFUL IN TAKING A HOSTAGE AND THAT HOSTAGE WERE TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO A NUCLEAR FACILITY WHAT COULD THEY DO WHAT COULD THEY ACCESS
THERE WOULD OF COURSE THEY WOULD OF COURSE CREATE MASS HYSTERIA I FEEL A POTENTIALLY WITH THEY'RE NOT
JUST BRIEFLY IF YOU WERE DOCTOR NO THIS YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THEY COULD OBTAIN MATERIAL AND HOSTAGE WE ONE ROUTE TO DO IT BUT THE IDEA THAT THIS WOULD LEAD TO MASS CASUALTIES LET ALONE A NUCLEAR BOMB IS STILL FOR SCIENCE FICTION I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD SEE MET CASUALTIES ON THE BOARD IT WOULD BE OBVIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT
BUT OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES HEROD HAD BEEN TRYING TO ACQUIRE THESE WEAPON WE HAVEN'T BEEN IN THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES IN CHECHNYA WE'RE WAY WITH A TERRORISTS TRIED TO USE THEM BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK AND HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY IN THAT RESPECT DOCTOR MILES NOTICED US
