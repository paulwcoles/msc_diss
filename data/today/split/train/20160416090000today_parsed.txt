IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE SIXTEENTH OF APRIL GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH NICK ROBINSON AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING POPE FRANCIS IS GOING TO THE GREEK ISLAND OF LESBOS TO MEET MIGRANTS WAITING TO FIND OUT IF THEY'LL BE DEPORTED BACK TO TURKEY THOUSANDS OF TROOPS ARE SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS OF THE SECOND EARTHQUAKE TO HIT SOUTHERN JAPAN IN TWO DAYS AND LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THE AUTHOR CLIVE JAMES ON PROUST POETRY AND HIS OWN MORTALITY
I KEEP MAKING HER PROMISES THAT I'LL DIE HOW DIET NEXT SPRING AND I DO IT WHICH ARE STARTING TO DISAPPOINT PEOPLE IT'S A GOOD JOKE PETULA WHO'D NOT A LOT AT MY END OF IT AND WHY NESSA IS TAKING INFLATABLES TO OUTER SPACE TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS KATHY CLAXTON POPE FRANCIS WILL VISIT THE GREEK ISLAND OF LES BOSS THIS MORNING TO SHOW HIS SUPPORT FOR MIGRANTS TRYING TO REACH EUROPE IS TRAVELLING WITH THE SPIRITUAL LEADER OF THE WORLD'S ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW
THE ISLAND HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN ENTRY POINTS FOR THE ONE MILLION PEOPLE WHO'VE ENTERED EUROPE OVER THE PAST YEAR MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY STUCK THERE WITH MANY FIT IN THE PROSPECT OF DEPORTATION FOLLOWING LAST MONTH'S CONTROVERSIAL DEAL BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND TURKEY FROM LESBOS A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE HAWLEY
THIS IS A SHORT BUT HIGHLY SYMBOLIC VISIT DESIGNED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO WHAT THE VATICAN HAS DESCRIBED AS A DIFFICULT DRAMATIC SITUATION THE POPE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR COMPASSION TO BE SHOWN TO PEOPLE FLEEING TERROR TURMOIL AND HARDSHIP HE'LL BE HOPING HIS TRIP TO LES BOSS WILL STIR EUROPE'S CONSCIENCE IT COMES AS THE HANDLING OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS FACES INTENSE CRITICISM FROM AID AGENCIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS
THE POPE WILL MEET REFUGEES HAD A CAMP WITH MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE AWAITING EITHER A SILENT OR DEPORTATION TO TURKEY AND NOW EFFECTIVELY INCARCERATED AND CONDITIONS AID WORKERS SAY A DEPLORABLE
THEN HOLD A CEREMONY TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO HAVE DIED TRYING TO REACH EUROPE'S SHORES THE POPE COMES HERE WITH A STRONG MORAL MESSAGE BUT NO SOLUTIONS
SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION IS UNDERWAY IN SOUTHERN JAPAN FOLLOWING THE SECOND POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE IN AROUND THIRTY HOURS AT LEAST NINETEEN PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE DIED IN THE LATEST QUICK WHICH HAD A MAGNITUDE OF SEVEN POINT THREE IT'S THOUGHT DOZENS MORE ARE TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE AFTER SOME BUILDINGS COLLAPSED AND OTHERS CAUGHT FIRE TEST BURKE HE LIVES ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES NORTH OF THE EPICENTRE SAYS THE AFTERSHOCKS CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME
WE REALISED AFTER A WHILE IT WAS JUST CONTINUING IN A LOW RUMBLING EVEN AFTER THAT SHORT CHEF IN THEN SOME EVEN LARGER ONES
AFTER THAT WE YOU'RE PRETTY SAFE BUT WE'RE READY TO GO IF WE NEED SUE WE'VE GOT TO SET IF WE HAVE TO EVACUATE BECAUSE IT CREATES TURN ANY TIME
TWENTY THOUSAND TROOPS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO HELP IN THE RESCUE EFFORT NOBLE AG ASATO FROM THE JAPANESE RED CROSS SAYS IT'S HARD TO GET A CLEAR IDEA OF THE SCALE OF THE DISASTER AS THE WORST AFFECTED AREAS ARE IN A REMOTE MOUNTAINOUS REGION
THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID IT WOULD BE NAKEDLY HYPOCRITICAL FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO ARGUE IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE WHITE HOUSE HAS CONFIRMED THAT DURING HIS VISIT TO THE U.K. NEXT WEEK MY OBAMA WILL SAY THE E. UNI OFFERS ECONOMIC AND SECURITY BENEFITS MY JOHNSON WHO'S ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE OFFICIAL OUT CAMPAIGN VOTE LEAVE SAID THE UNITED STATES ITSELF WOULD NOT DREAM OF SHARING DEMOCRACY HE'S BEEN SPEAKING TO OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA CAN SPARE
BORIS JOHNSON COULD HARDLY BE MORE DISMISSIVE OF THE ARGUMENTS BEING PUT FORWARD BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE I.M.F. THE BANK OF ENGLAND NATO AND EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE THE MAYOR OF LONDON SAID ECONOMIC CONCERNS ABOUT LEAVING THE E.U. WERE FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG ANDY CLAIMED THE UNION WAS CORRUPT
HE SAID THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LIKELY WARNINGS ABOUT DEPARTURE WOULD BE NAKEDLY HYPOCRITICAL I JUST FIND IT ABSOLUTELY BIZARRE THAT WERE BEING LECTURED BY THE AMERICANS ABOUT GIVING UP OUR SOVEREIGNTY AND GIVING UP CONTROL WHEN THE AMERICANS WON'T EVEN SIGN UP TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA THERE LET ALONE THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT
REMAIN CAMPAIGN SOURCES SAY THOSE ARGUING TO LEAVE CAN'T ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC RISKS AND COUNT ATTRACT THE BACKING OF ANY THIRD PARTIES OF ANY STATURE WHEN PRESSED FOR ENDORSEMENTS TO RIVAL THE ENCAMP THE MAYOR OF LONDON STUMBLED
THE CONSERVATIVE FORMER CHANCELLOR KEN CLARKE HAS SAID DAVID CAMERON WOULD NOT LAST THIRTY SECONDS AS PRIME MINISTER IF BRITAIN VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. MY CAMERON SAID THIS WEEK THAT HE INTENDED TO STAY IN DOWNING STREET EVEN IF THE REFERENDUM ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD WENT AGAINST HIM
BUT MISTER CLARKE TOLD THE WEEK AT WESTMINSTER HERE ON RADIO FOUR THAT THE IDEA OF THE PRIME MINISTER LEADING THE PROCESS OF WITHDRAWING FROM THE YOU HAVING CAMPAIGNED AGAINST IT WAS FARCICAL
A DELEGATION OF SENIOR EUROPEAN UNION OFFICIALS HAS ARRIVED IN TERROR FOR THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TALKS BETWEEN EUROPE AND THEY RAN IN MORE THAN A DECADE THERE BEING LED BY THE E. USE FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF FEDERICA MUGGER HEANEY THE VISIT HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY LAST YEAR'S AGREEMENT ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAMME A CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT LEASED TO SET REPORTS FROM TEHRAN
THIS HIGH LEVEL VISIT MARKS THE START OF A NEW PHASE IN EUROPE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU ON THAT IF CAN LOOK AT DELEGATION INCLUDES SEVEN E.U. COMMISSIONERS DEALING WITH ISSUES RANGING FROM TRADE TO ENERGY IN THE ENVIRONMENT AREAS BOTH SIDES ARE KEEN TO EXPLORE NOW THAT IRAN HAS IMPLEMENTED ITS COMMITMENTS UNDER THE NUCLEAR DEAL THAT PAVED THE WAY FOR THE LIFTING A FINANCIAL SANCTIONS BUT SANCTIONS LINKED TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND TERRORISM ARE STILL IN PLACE
LOOK AT HEANEY WILL RAISE THESE ISSUES IN HER DISCUSSIONS HERE AS WELL AS WHAT'S SAID TO BE ONE OF HER MAJOR CONCERNS HOW TO BRING AN END TO SERIOUS PUNISHING WAR WHICH WOULD ALSO HELP RESOLVE EUROPE'S MIGRATION CRISIS
IRANIAN OFFICIALS SAY THEY ALSO WANT TO STRENGTHEN THIS RELATIONSHIP ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE TAKING PLACE IN TEHRAN TODAY IS STILL TRUE POLITICALLY SENSITIVE TO HAVE WITH THE UNITED STATES
M.P.S ARE CALLING FOR CHANGES TO THE WAY BROADBAND SPEED TO ADVERTISED BY INTERNET PROVIDERS THE BRITISH INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER FIFTY M.P.S FROM ALL PARTIES SAYS THE VAST MAJORITY OF CUSTOMERS AREN'T GETTING THE DOWNLOAD SPEEDS THEY'RE PAYING FOR IN THEIR CONTRACTS IT DESCRIBES THIS AS A MIS SELLING SCANDAL ON A PAR WITH P.P.I. HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IN WATSON
THE BRITISH INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP OF M.P.S' CLAIMS AT THE ADVERTISING OF BROADBAND SPEEDS IT'S MISLEADING AND THEN YOU REPORT THE GROUP ARGUES THAT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AREN'T IN BREACH OF CURRENT GUIDANCE NINETY PER CENT OF THE CUSTOMERS CAN'T GET THE FASTEST ADVERTISED SPEEDS I DID POINTS OUT THERE'S NO MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMPENSATION IF CUSTOMERS RECEIVE A POORER SERVICE
THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTER GRANT SHOPS WHO SET UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP SAID IT WAS SCANDALOUS THAT MANY CONSUMERS WEREN'T GETTING THIS BITSY EXPECTED HIS CRIPPLE NO CAMPAIGN FROM MANDATORY REFUNDS FOR CUSTOMERS WHO'VE BEEN MIS SOLD A BROADBAND CONTRACT THE ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY SAYS IT'S GUIDANCE WAS DRAWN UP FOLLOWING A PUBLIC CONSULTATION BUT RECOGNISES DOES CONCERN AND WILL CONSIDER DOING FURTHER WORK ON THE ISSUE
THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS ABOUT TO BECOME A LITTLE BIT BIGGER AN EXPANDABLE ROOM IS DUE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE ORBITING LABORATORY TODAY THE HOPE IS THAT IT COULD PROVIDE A WAY OF MAKING CHEAPER SPACE MODULES FOR USE ABOVE EARTH THE MOON AND EVEN MARS AS OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN AMOS EXPLAINS THE PROJECT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY A PROPERTY ENTREPRENEUR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA
THE AMERICAN ROBERT BIGELOW BUILT HIS FORTUNE ON THE BACK OF A BUDGET HOTEL CHAIN AND HE'S NOW DETERMINED TO TAKE THAT ACCOMMODATION EXPERIENCE INTO ORBIT HE'S MANUFACTURING EXPANDABLE SPACE MODULES THAT USE A SUPER TOUGH FLEXIBLE POLYMER TO PROVIDE PROTECTION RATHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL METAL SHELLS ON EXISTING HABITATS
THE VESSEL TO BE ATTACHED TO THE SPACE STATION IS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN A PHONE BOOTH AND WILL UNDERGO TWO YEARS OF TESTING MY BIGELOW HAS PLANS FOR MODELS THAT ARE ONE HUNDRED TIMES BIGGER HE HOPES TO RENT THESE OUT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO USE THEM FOR SCIENCE THEY COULD EVEN BE HOTELS HE SAYS HIGH FLYING DESTINATIONS FOR ASTRONAUT TOURISTS
THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE LEAVE BOO TOWN TODAY AND RETURNED TO INDIA FOR THE FINAL ENGAGEMENT OF THEIR TOUR A VISIT TO THE TAJ MAHAL IN AGRA PRINCE WILLIAM'S MOTHER DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES WENT THERE ON HER OWN IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO JUST BEFORE SHE AND PRINCE CHARLES SEPARATORS
THANK YOU KATHY IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN
IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING THE EARTH SHOOK BUILDINGS ROCKED PEOPLE RAN FOR SHELTER FROM THE IMPACT OF A SECOND BIGGER EARTHQUAKE IN THE JAPANESE CITY OF KUMA MOTU WE'RE JOINED BY OUR CORRESPONDENT IN TOKYO RUPERT WINGFIELD HAYES
IT IS THE FACT THAT ITS SECOND AND BIGGER THAT IS A SURPRISE RUPERT ISN'T IT BECAUSE OFTEN THE SECOND EARTHQUAKE IS RATHER SMALLER THAN THE FIRST ONE
THAT'S CERTAINLY THE WAY ROUND YOU'D EXPECTED NIK AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE USED TO HERE SO THIS WAS THERE WAS NO EXPECT THERE WAS THE EXPECTATION OF AFTERSHOCKS WHAT THE SEISMOLOGIST HERE IN JAPAN ARE SAYING NOW IS ACTUALLY THURSDAY NIGHT'S QUAKE WHICH IS A SIX POINT FOUR ON THE RIG TO SCALE WAS NOT THE MAIN EVENT IT WAS A PRECURSOR IT WAS SORT OF THE LOOSENING OF THE FAULT LINE WHICH WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY A MUCH BIGGER MUCH LONGER SEVEN POINT THREE EARTHQUAKE
ONE TWENTY FIVE A.M. LAST NIGHT WHICH DID CONSIDERABLY MORE DAMAGE MOVE THE FAULT LINE THEY RECKON UP TO FIVE METRES IT MAY HAVE SHIFTED AND IT'S DONE A LOT MORE DAMAGE AND BECAUSE JAPAN IS SO WELL PREPARED FOR THIS THE CASUALTY FIGURES OFTEN SEEM RELATIVELY LOW DREADFUL OF COURSE BUT RELATIVELY LOW BUT THIS IS THIS IS ON QUITE A SCALE THE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN DONE ISN'T IT
IT'S ON A VERY LARGE SCALE A VERY LARGE AREAS SO THIS MORNING YOU KNOW AS LIGHT AS DAWN CAME UP OVER IN THE HELICOPTERS THE JAPANESE T.V. STATIONS HAD THE HELICOPTERS FLYING OVER THE AREA AND SURVEYING THE DAMAGE WE JUST SAW THAT IT WASN'T IT WAS MUCH LARGER THAN THAN THURSDAY NIGHT SO LARGE LANDSLIDES BURYING HOUSES BRIDGES DOWN ROADS SEVERED
QUITE LARGE MODERN BUILDINGS ALSO DAMAGED BY THIS EARTHQUAKE ON THURSDAY NIGHT HE'D HAVE MAINLY BEEN OLDER WOODEN HOUSES THAT HAVE COME DOWN BUT MUCH I MEAN THINGS LIKE A HOSPITAL WAS SO BADLY DAMAGED THEY DECIDED TO EVACUATE THE WHOLE BUILDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT LAST NIGHT SO VERY WIDESPREAD BUT AS YOU SAY THE DEATH TOLL MERCIFULLY STILL RELATIVELY LOW THEY'RE SAYING
THE DEATH TOLL FROM BOTH NIGHT IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN WHICH OF COURSE IS TERRIBLE BUT IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES TO EARTHQUAKES OF THIS SIZE YOU'D BE TALKING HUNDREDS MAYBE EVEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DO IT NOW IT'S WHAT EARLY AFTERNOON WITH YOU AT THE AT THE MOMENT OF THE EARTHQUAKE WAS IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING SO PRESUMABLY THERE'S STILL A HUGE CLEAR UP JOB TO DO AND FEARS THAT MANY MORE INJURED WILL BE FOUND UNDERNEATH THE RUBBLE
YET THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL ACTIVE RESCUE OPERATIONS GOING ON THEY SAY THERE ARE STILL A NUMBER OF PEOPLE TRAPPED MAY BE BURIED IN THAT SOME MAY BE BURIED IN THAT LANDSLIDE
THEY SO WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE DEATH TOLL MIGHT BE BE GO HIGHER ABSOLUTE CHAOS FOR EVERYBODY THERE BECAUSE OF COURSE NOW TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW LOTS OF AFTERSHOCKS EVERYBODY SPENDING TWO NIGHTS OUTSIDE IN PARKS AND ON STREETS WRAPPED IN BLANKETS NOW WITH A THIRD NIGHT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANOTHER LARGE QUAICH IS HIS INFINITE TESTIMONY SMALL BUT PEOPLE ARE VERY VERY JITTERY NOW AND VERY GOOD
INTO THEIR HOMES REPORT WINFIELD HAYES THANK YOU IT IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE'S BEEN ENDLESS SPECULATION EVER SINCE DAVID CAMERON ANNOUNCE THE REFERENDUM AS TO WHETHER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SURVIVE AS PRIME MINISTER IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WILL NOW ONE OF THE BIG BEASTS OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE FORMER CHANCELLOR KEN CLARKE HAS PUT INTO WORDS WHAT MANY BELIEVE HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE WEEK IN WESTMINSTER ON RADIO FOUR TO BE BROADCAST AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING
THE PRIME MINISTER WOULDN'T LAST THIRTY SECONDS IF HE LOST THE REFERENDUM WHEN WE PLUNGE INTO A CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CRISIS WHICH IS NEVER A VERY EDIFYING SIGHT IN MY EXPERIENCE IT WOULD BE IN A FARCICAL POSITION HAVING CAMPAIGN FOR POSITION'S BEEN REJECTED HE WOULD BE A PRIME MINSTER FACING A PARLIAMENT IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WANTED TO REMAIN IN THE YOU LEAVE LEAVE IS IN THE MINORITY IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY
THEN RIGHT HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT WOULDN'T LAST THIRTY SECONDS
SPEAKING PROBABLY A TRUTH THAT MANY TORY M.P.S PRIVATELY ACKNOWLEDGE DAVID CAMERON THIS WEEK SAID REPEATED HIS HIS VIEW THAT HE WOULD BE THERE RIGHT THROUGH EVEN IF THIS REFERENDUM WAS LOST UNTIL THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT AS I SAID MANY TORY M.P.S DON'T THINK THAT IS REMOTELY POT LIKELY AND THAT IS WHAT KEN CLARKE
HE'S SAYING HE SAYS IT WOULD BE JUST FARCICAL OF HAVING CAMPAIGNED FOR BRITAIN TO STAY IN THEIR LOST BUT HE COULD CARRY ON NOW IF YOU DID GO MANY PEOPLE WOULD THEN TURN THEIR ATTENTION OF COURSE TO BORIS JOHNSON HE WAS NOW FRONT AND CENTRE
OF THE CAMPAIGN TO TAKE BRITAIN OUT OF THE UNION AND HE WAS ASKED ABOUT KEN CLARKE'S COMMENTS BY THE POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG AND HE SAID THAT KEN CLARKE WAS BEING UNCOMMONLY PESSIMISTIC HE SAID THAT DAVID CAMERON WOULD BE IN A STRONG POSITION TO STAY IN PLACE AND THEN
GET INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO CREATE A NEW DEAL THAT COMPLETELY UNLIKELY ON THE OTHER MISTER JOHNSON IS NOT EXACTLY TURNING OUT TO BE THE CLOSEST FRIEND DAVID CAMERON HAS EVER HAD WAS HOW WAS HE DESCRIBED WE'D NOT SPECIFICALLY BY NAME BUT IT WAS CLEAR HE WAS REFERRING TO TALK ABOUT THAT
GERALD RATNER OF POLITICS WE ALL KNOW WHAT GERALD RATNER THOUGHT OF HIS OWN PRODUCTS SELLING A PRODUCT THAT YOU KNOW IS RUBBISH IS THE STRONG LABOUR NEVER MIND YES THAT ONE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BORIS JOHNSON SAID IN THIS INTERVIEW AND I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING JUST HOW MUCH BORIS JOHNSON IS NOW PLACING HIMSELF
AT THE FRONT AND CENTRE OF THIS CAMPAIGN HE WAS AT A RALLY IN MANCHESTER LAST NIGHT HE'LL BE AT A RALLY IN NEWCASTLE LEEDS LATER TODAY THE NORTH OF ENGLAND LABOUR TERRITORY PEOPLE THAT THOUGHT BORIS JOHNSON MIGHT COME OUT FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THEN GO GO QUIET AND TAKE A BIT OF A BACKSEAT HAVE BEEN PROVED WRONG HE'S GOING TO BE PRETTY MUCH THE LEADER OF THIS CAMPAIGN IT SEEMS
HE PAINTED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH LAURA A TYPICALLY PANT PLANK GLOSSY AND PICTURE OF BRITAIN OUTSIDE THE THE E.U. DISMISSING THE GLOOM MONGERS OF THE REMAINING CAMPAIGN SAYING IT WAS ALL ABOUT TAKING BACK CONTROL OF MONEY AND BORDERS HE ALSO SAID THAT THE INTERVENTION WE EXPECT NEXT WEEK FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA HE'S COMING TO THE U.K. AND IS EXPECTED TO SAY THAT BRITAIN MUST STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS IN BORIS JOHNSON'S VIEW NAKEDLY HYPOCRITICAL BECAUSE HE DIDN'T THINK THE U.S. WOULD EVER SEE
PAUL SOVEREIGNTY WITH ANY OTHER COUNTRY SO HE'S GOING TO HAVE A CENTRAL ROLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN SAY THAT HE SIMPLY CANNOT BE BRECK'S IT CAMPAIGN CANNOT EXPLAIN
AWAY THE ECONOMIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LEAVING AND THAT'S THEIR CRITICISM OF BORIS JOHNSON HAS BEEN SAYING IT'S HOTTING UP
IT IS A QUARTER PAST SEVEN TOTALLY UNLIMITED BROADBAND UP TO SEVENTEEN MEGABYTES FASTER THAN ALL OUR RIVALS THAT OR SOMETHING LIKE IT IS WHAT THE ADVERTS TELL YOU SO WHY IS IT THAT YOUR BROADBAND MY BROADBAND
THAT SEEMS TO GO NOTHING LIKE THAT QUICKLY THE ANSWER ACCORDING TO A NEW CROSS PARTY GROUP THE BRITISH INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP IS THAT THE ADS ARE MISLEADING GRANT CHAPS FORMER TORY CHAIRMAN CONSERVATIVE M.P. AND HEAD OF THIS NEW CROSS PARTY GROUP JOINS US IN THE MORNING TO YOU MY ABS
DO WE HAVE AN ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY TO MAKE SURE THE ADS MISLEADING YET AND STRANGELY THEY'RE SORT OF SUB COMMITTEE I THINK IT IS THE COMMITTEE OF ADVERTISING PRACTISE SAY AS LONG AS ONE IN TEN PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE THE ADVERTISED SPEED WELL THEN THAT'S O.K.
AND IT SEEMS TO US THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY SO HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE ADVERTISING REGULATION ORDER BROUGHT BACK I THINK THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE BROADBAND AND CLEARLY THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH BROADBAND IN THIS COUNTRY RECENTLY THAT THE BRITISH INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP CAMPAIGNED TO ASK OFCOM SPLIT APART THAT THE B.T. OPENREACH THAT'S THE INFRASTRUCTURE THIS IS THIS IS NOW TALKING ABOUT ALL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE ANYTHING LIKE THE SPEED'S THERE ADVERTISING OF COURSE ONCE YOU'RE IN THE CONTRACT
YOU CAN'T LEAVE IT AND YOU DON'T GET COMPENSATION SO YOU DIDN'T WIN THE ARGUMENT ABOUT BILLETING UP BEAT IAN GREAT SO WHAT MORE PRACTICAL MAYBE SMALLER SCALE THINGS ARE YOU NOW TRYING TO I'D SAY WE DIDN'T WIN IT ON THAT OCCASION OFCOM HAVE SAID OH KAY WILL GIVE B.T. OPENREACH ONE MORE CHANCE AT WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE THOUGH IS THAT THE SPEEDS IF ONLY ONE IN TEN PEOPLE HAVE TO GET THEM A COMPLETELY INADEQUATE BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU
BUY A TRAIN TICKET YOUR TRAIN IS LATE OR PLANE TICKET IN THE PLANE YOU GET COMPENSATED WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THESE BROADBAND CONTRACTS AS YOU BUY A BROKE OUT BRAND CONTRACT TWENTY FOUR MEG A BIT DOWNLOAD WHATEVER IT SAYS THEN YOU DISCOVER YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANYTHING LIKE IT AND THEN YOU FIND YOU'RE STUCK WITH IT FOR A YEAR TWO YEARS AND YOU CAN'T LEAVE IT ON YOU WANT TO ENHANCE CONSUMER RIGHTS IS THAT ABOUT LEGISLATION NOT YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE THREE THINGS FIRST OF ALL RATHER THAN ONE IN TEN IT SHOULD BE NINE IN TEN PEOPLE RECEIVED THE SPEED SECONDLY SHOULD GET AUTOMATIC COMPENSATION
THIRDLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO THE CONTRACT AND IF WE CAN'T GET THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS OR INDEED THE REGULATORS TO DO THAT OR THAN PARLIAMENT WILL NEED TO ACT YES AND IF YOU ACTUALLY NINETY STACHEL ROWS ABOUT CABLE BUMBLING ABOUT YOUR T. V. THINGS ARE A BIG PART OF POLITICS DO YOU YOU SEEM TO BELIEVE THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT BROADBAND IS GOING TO BECOME
SOMETHING CONSUMERS REALLY CARE BASHING IS HUGE I MEAN THIS THE BRITISH INFRASTRUCTURE GROUPS CROSS PARTY WE'VE GOT M.P.S FROM ALL THE POLITICAL PARTY BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT IF WE CANNOT GET THE SOLVED IN THE FOURTH UTILITY THE BROADBAND WILL LEAVE US BEHIND IN THIS COUNTRY SO WE MUST GET THIS SORTED OUT AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS CONSUMER PRESSURE THROUGH ALLOWING REFUNDS OR BREAKING CONTRACTS WE HAVE ONLY SECONDS LEFT I'M AFRAID BUT JUST HOW MANY SECONDS WOULD DAVID CAMERON SURVIVE IF HE LOSES THIS REFERENDUM YOU'RE A FORMER PARTY CHAIRMAN
I THINK THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WE EVEN KNOW WHY I SAY I PROBABLY REPRESENT THE ONE IN THREE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE YET TO DECIDE I'M THROWING THIS OPEN TO A PUBLIC DEBATE OF THE UNIVERSE MY FEAR AND THE OUTCOME COULD BE ANYTHING FROM A BIG MAJORITY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER TO SOMETHING QUITE SMALL SO YOU CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION OF HOW LONG HE SURVIVES WITHOUT KNOWING THE OUTCOME AND I SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE VILLAGE I'M NOT ANSWERING IT VERY VERY MUCH O.K. A GRAND JETE

THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID IT WOULD BE NAKEDLY HYPOCRITICAL FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO ARGUE IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHEN HE VISITS THE U.K. NEXT WEEK MISTER JOHNSON A PROMINENT LEAVE CAMPAIGNER SO THE UNITED STATES WOULDN'T DREAM OF SHARING DEMOCRACY
THE SENIOR CONSERVATIVE BACKBENCHER KEN CLARKE SAYS THE IDEA THAT DAVID CAMERON COULD REMAIN AS PRIME MINISTER IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS FARCICAL MY CAMERON SAID THIS WEEK THAT HE INTENDED TO STAY IN DOWNING STREET EVEN IF THE REFERENDUM GOES AGAINST HIM BUT MISTER CLARKE WHO IS ALSO CAMPAIGNING TO STAY IN THE E.U. SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER WOULDN'T LAST THIRTY SECONDS IF THEY LOST
THE E. USE FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF FEDERICA MUGGER RENEE HAS ARRIVED IN TEHRAN FOR THE HIGHEST LEVEL TALKS BETWEEN THE E.U. AND IRAN IN MORE THAN A DECADE A DELEGATION INCLUDES SEVEN EUROPEAN COMMISSIONERS IN CHARGE OF AREAS SUCH AS TRADED ENERGY ON THE ENVIRONMENT
THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WILL TODAY BECOME A LITTLE BIT BIGGER WHEN IT GETS A NEW EXPANDABLE ROOM IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THE ORBITING LABORATORY HAS BEEN EXTENDED WITH A MODULE MADE FROM A SUPER TOUGH FLEXIBLE POLYMER RATHER THAN RIGID MATERIALS
IF THE NEW ROOM IS SHOWN TO BE DURABLE IT COULD PROVIDE AN EASIER AND CHEAPER WAY OF MAKING SPACE HABITATS FOR USE ABOVE EARTH THE MOON OR EVEN MARS
IT'S HARPER SEVEN IN BRAZIL PRESIDENT DE L'AMOUR RESET THE COUNTRY'S FIRST FEMALE POLITICAL LEADER IS FIGHTING FOR HER POLITICAL LIFE AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS PREPARED TO VOTE ON AN IMPEACHMENT PROPOSAL AGAINST MY PHONE OUR ALLIES IN THE WORKERS' PARTY GOVERNMENT HAVE DISMISSED THE PROCEEDINGS AS ILLEGAL AND TANTAMOUNT TO A CONSTITUTIONAL COUP DATA
BUT HER OPPONENTS WE NEED A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY FOR THE MOTION TO SUCCEED BLAMED THE PRESIDENT FOR CHRONIC ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT AND SAY THE PRESIDENT HAS COMMITTED FISCAL CRIMES FOR WHICH SHE MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FROM THE CAPITAL BRASILIA WERE A DAVIS REPORTS
THE DEATH OF THE DEMOGRAPHY OFF IF THERE'S A BOAT I DUNNO GIVE MEN I THINK THAT'S BETTER
THE DATE ON THE LOWER HOUSE OF CONGRESS IN BRASILIA WERE ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH THREE DAYS OF PARTISAN DEBATE THAT COULD TRIGGER PRESIDENT JOHN THE ROOST SETH'S REMOVAL FROM OFFICE
LIKE THESE PROTESTERS ARRIVED IN THE CAPITAL LAST NIGHT
MAJORITY OF BRAZILIAN SUPPORT CALLS FOR THEIR PRESIDENT'S RESIGNATION OR HIM
THEY SAY ECONOMIC RECESSION AND DAMAGING CORRUPTIONS
THE ROAD DID RECESS LEGITIMACY AND HER WRISTS ORATORY WE WANT THE FORM OF YOUR MA WAS
NOT ONLY DO YOU MY RECESS WE NEED TO DISCARD IT
ON PAPER THE PRESIDENT FACES IMPEACHMENT OF A RELATIVELY MINOR CHARGES OF FISCAL IRREGULARITIES TO CONCEAL A GROWING DEFICIT
THE IRONY NOT LOST ON POLITICAL COMMENTATOR MAURITIUS SON TARO IS THAT MANY OF THE MEN SITTING IN JUDGEMENT ON THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF FAR MORE SERIOUS OFFENCES LIKE CORRUPTION AND EMBEZZLEMENT THE PROBLEM TO BRAZIL TODAY IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE GOTH AMANT
FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE OLDER INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE OF ELECTORAL FRAUD EVEN HOMICIDE AND THEIR PEOPLE HAVE THIS FEELING THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CORRUPT POLITICIANS INVESTIGATING I DO CORRUPT POLITICIANS SO WE HAVE THIS GAP OF CONFIDENCE IN THE BRAZILIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM
FOLLOWING THE SOMEWHAT AN EDIFYING PROCEEDINGS IN CONGRESS FROM HIS MODEST HOME IN A REAR VISION MIRROR FOR VALOUR IS RONALDO MUDDY THE SON OF A STREET CLEANER IS TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD STUDENT WAS A TYPICAL BRAZIL SUCCESS STORY OF THE LAST DECADE WHEN THE ECONOMY BOOMED AND MILLIONS WERE BROUGHT OUT OF POVERTY BUT RONALDO IS CONCERNED
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH BRAZILIANS IS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE SHORT MEMORIES WERE NOW DE TELLS ME LIKE MANY PEOPLE HE'S WORRIED BUT WHAT WAS ACHIEVED MIGHT JUST AS EASILY
THE HUGE ANTI GOVERNMENT PROTESTS OF RECENT EVENTS IN THE AFFLUENT AREAS OF IPANEMA AND LEBANON THAT RONALDO CAN SEE FROM HIS FOR BELLA BUT EXPOSE MANY OF THE DEEP DIVISIONS IN SOCIETY
ACCORDING TO FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER SELF SO I MARRY HIM AN ALLY OF JOHN THE RECESS THERE'S A CLASS OF PEOPLE HERE WHO SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO SHARE BRAZIL'S WEALTH AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT THOSE SINCE THAT YOU CANNOT MEET IN RELATION TO DO BRAZILIAN ELITE HE WON'T ACCEPT
A GOVERNMENT THAT FIGHTS FORM MORE EQUALITY AS AN ALL BRAZIL IS A VERY UNEQUAL GALLANTRY AND THEY WON'T ACCEPT THE COUNTRY DOESN'T WANTS TO HAVE A MORAL BARNABAS POSITION IN THE WORLD SCENE AND WELL WHEN YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS TOGETHER AND ESPECIALLY WITH A DIFFICULT ECONOMIC SITUATION YOU HAVE A SITUATION AT THE HELP
OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS OUTSIDE CONGRESS THIS WEEKEND ARE IN JUBILANT MOOD THEY THINK THEY CAN SECURE THE NECESSARY TWO THIRDS MAJORITY TO FORCE A OF IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN THE SENATE
AND TRIGGERED THE SUSPENSION OF THE PRESIDENT
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN SUCH AN EVENTUALITY WORRIES EVERYBODY GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS SAY THEY WON'T TAKE THE RESULT LYING DOWN AND SIMPLY GOD ACCEPT THE AUTHORITY AND ANYBODY WHO REPLACES A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT
THESE ARE WORRYING DAYS FOR BRAZIL AND IT'S SHAKY DEMOCRACY
WAS WORD DAVIES REPORTING FROM BRAZIL THE TIME HAS JUST TURNED TWENTY FIVE TO EIGHT AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND ALASTAIR CAMPBELL WHO WAS OF COURSE TONY BLAIR'S DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR MANY YEARS REFLECTS ON THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES HE'S A SUPPORTER OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN AND PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY PERSUADED BY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAN THEY ARE BY ECONOMIC AUTHORITIES THE MEDIA OR POLITICIANS WHICH DOESN'T STOP THEM TRYING THE VIEWS OF BORIS JOHNSON WHO WANTS THE U.K. LEAVE OF COURSE
A WIDELY REPORTED FOR EXAMPLE IN THE EXPRESS AND THE TELEGRAPH THE MIRROR HAS ALREADY HAD ENOUGH OF THEM DESCRIBED MY JOHNSON AS A JOKE WHO IS NO LONGER FUNNY A LIGHTWEIGHT A PURVEYOR OF SMEARS AND SPIN IF PRESIDENT OBAMA THINKS HE CAN INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME SEVERAL PAPERS HAVE SOME ADVICE FOR HIM THE SON SAYS HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT TO STICK HIS NOSE INTO SUCH A BIG DECISION FOR OUR COUNTRY AND IS HYPOCRISY STINKS
IT THINKS HE'S INTERESTED ONLY IN WHAT'S BEST FOR AMERICA THE DAILY MAIL BELIEVES AMERICANS WOULDN'T IN A MILLION YEARS JOIN AN ORGANISATION LIKE THE E.U. AND SUBMIT TO WHAT IT CALLS STATE EST SOCIALIST LEGISLATION MADE BY FOREIGNERS DON'T MEDDLE IT CONCLUDES PHOTOGRAPH OF THE GUARDIAN SHOWS A TYPICAL FRENCH SQUARE TREES AWNINGS OUTSIDE TABLES PAINTINGS ON DISPLAY COBBLED STREETS AND ALL THAT WALKING TOWARDS THE CAMERA
THREE SOLDIERS CARRYING AUTOMATIC AUTOMATIC RIFLES AND THE PAPAL CALLS PARIS THE MOST MILITARISED CITY IN WESTERN EUROPE THE REASONS TO HARD TO FIND THE TIMES A SPECIAL REPORT ON THE BACKGROUND TO THE ISLAMIST ATTACKS THAT MURDERED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE IN NOVEMBER AND THE ROLE PLAYED IN RECRUITING EXTREMISTS IN BRUSSELS BY THE PAPER DESCRIBES HIM AS A FOUL MOUTHED BIGOT A BIZARRE COMBINATION
HIS LIMITS FANATIC AND PROFANE CRIMINAL THE SUN OFFERS AT A BLEAK LOOK AT THE THREAT OF TERRORISM REPORTS THE WOMEN WHO'D BOUGHT THEIR UNDERWEAR FROM M. AND S. MAY SET OFF AIRPORT SECURITY SCANNERS APPARENTLY MARKS AND SPENCER'S USE A METAL WHICH HIS RIVALS DON'T AND BORDER AGENCY STAFF HAVE BECOME USED TO THEIR BRAS SETTING OFF THE WARNING ALARMS OTHER THINGS WHICH CAN TRIGGER AN ALERT IT SAYS WITH GLYCERINE AND CREAMS AND JAIL SHOE INSERTS THE PAPER SUMS THAT ALL UP AS WEAPONS OF MASS DISTRACTION
IT SEEMS THE LIGHT HEARTED BANTER PRODUCED BY TERRY WOGAN EUROVISION SONG CONTEST DID NOT PLEASE EVERYONE THE PAPERS REPORT THAT THE SWEDISH PRODUCER OF THE SHOW HAS DELIVERED IN THE WORDS OF THE EXPRESS A STINGING ATTACK ON HIS TOE AND ACCUSED HIM OF SPOILING THE EVENT AND TURNING INTO KITSCH THE MIRROR IS
VERY CROSS IT SAYS THIS CHEERLESS SWEDE MUST HAVE HAD A REALITY BY POSITIVES LET'S LET'S BE HONEST THE QUALITY OF THE ACTS HE'S MORE CRUISE LINER THAN TOP OF THE BILL THE MALE PRINCE A LIST OF THE TWENTY PLACES ITS READERS MIGHT VISIT IN ORDER TO SEE BRITAIN IN BLOOM
UNFORTUNATELY THE TELEGRAPH REPORTS THE LARGEST DAFFODIL FESTIVAL IN THE VILLAGE OF TRIP THRIPP LOW IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE IS UNLIKELY TO CLAIM HER PLACE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE WARMEST WINTER ON RECORD TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ITS DAFFODILS HAVE ALREADY BLOOMED BUT NOW RATHER SADLY THEY HAVE DIED
YEAH YOU PAY A PRICE FOR THE EARLY SPRING I KNOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND HERE'S JIM WITH THIS WEEK'S MEET THE AUTHOR INTERVIEW I'M IN CAMBRIDGE WITH CLIVE JAMES WRITER CRITIC WIT WHO THINKS OF HIMSELF MOST OF ALL
AS A POINT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE LOVES DOING MOST AND ALONG WITH HIS COLLECTED POEMS HE'S PUBLISHING THIS MONTH GATE OF LILACS WHICH HE CALLS A VERSE COMMENTARY ON PROUST AND HIS GREAT NOVEL REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST
WHICH HE SAYS IS DEVOTED MOSTLY TO THE AUTHOR'S GRATITUDE FOR LIFE FOR LOVE AND FOR ART OR GRATITUDE THAT HE SHARES AS HE FACES HIS OWN MORTALITY IT IS ABOUT YOU CLIVE BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT PROUST WHO FASCINATED YOU WOULDN'T MOVE DO YOU AND DREW YOU IN
I THINK I'VE FORMED A CONNECTION WITH HIM QUITE EARLY ON WHEN I FIRST TRIED TO START READING HER MANY YEARS AGO AND THE FOOD THAT I FORM A CONNECTION ALWAYS QUITE REMARKABLE COS WE WERE VERY VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OR FOR ONE THING HE'S DEAD FOR ANOTHER I PERSISTED NOT BEING
FOR ANOTHER HE WAS SHALL WE SAY A BIT EXQUISITE AND I'M THE OTHER THING YOU TALK ABOUT HIM BRINGING THE BOOK TO FULL BLOOM IN THE HOTHOUSE OF HIS DYING THESE ARE YOUR WORDS AS EVERYONE KNOWS YOU'VE BEEN QUITE ILL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND YOU'VE TALKED AND THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT DEATH IS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU WANT TO DO RIGHT THIS
A OF PROUST OR YOU REACTIONS TO IT WAS THE MAID THE ESSENTIAL POINT IS THAT THE PRIEST WAS ALWAYS DYING HE WAS AN ASTHMATIC WHICH FEELS LIKE DYING ALL THE TIME AND THAT I I GOT SICK VERY LATE IN MY LIFE SO I HAD A LIFE TO LOOK BACK ON
WHICH WAS HEALTHY AND IMPROVES DID NOT BUT I HAVE
AS THE END CAME NEARER AND INCIDENTALLY IS PERPETUALLY NOT COMING NEAR ENOUGH I KEEP MAKING PROMISES THAT DIE HOW DIRE NEXT SPRING AND I DO IT TO STUDY TO DISAPPOINT BUT HE WILL IT'S A GOOD JOKE BUT YOU DO NOT A LOT AT MY END OF IT BUT PRINCE KNEW THAT HE WAS A GONER SO IS
PUTTING HIS BOOK TOGETHER WAS AN ACT OF HEROISM REALLY I ADMIRE HER BEYOND WORDS WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT IT IN THE VERSE FORM YOU'VE CHOSEN THAT YOU COULDN'T SAY ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW A CRITICAL ESSAY
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE TONE THEN A CRITICAL ESSAY WHAT THE ONWARD MARCH OF THIS POWER TWENTY TEN THOUSAND WORDS LONG BUT I TH BUT I THINK IT HAS THE FEELING OF BEING QUITE BIG AND THE POEM ENDS LIKE THIS HERE IN MY KITCHEN WHICH HAS NO CORK WALLS
ONLY THE ENGLISH OR EARLY SUMMER LIGHT THAT POURS IN FROM THE GARDEN WHERE MY WIFE AND I MEET ON MY BALCONY TO COUNT THE BIRDS AND WONDER HOW TO MAKE THEM STAY
WE'VE OVERDONE THE FOOD I THINK NEXT SPRING IF I'M STILL HERE TO HELP WE MIGHT DIAL DOWN THERE CHARLES APPLY IT'S LIKE MAXINE'S OUT THERE IT'S TOO MUCH
WE USED TO SOMETIMES THAT AS WELL BUT NOT SO OFTEN AS HE IS AUSTERE SEEING ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU SEE THE REST AS THE FACE OF LORIANNE IS NOT DESCRIBED
BUT ONLY CONJURED FROM YOUR MEMORIES OF EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE LOVED AND SOON ALL THAT I LOVE WILL LEAVE ME AS I GO FIRST INTO SILENCE THAN THE FIRE
AND THEN THE HARBOUR WATER IN WHICH THEY WILL BE AT LAST NO ROOM TO BREATHE NO TIME TO THINK
NO TIME TO THINK EVEN IF YOU SELL IT TALK ABOUT A HARBOUR A BEAUTIFUL HARBOUR IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE LINES AND IT MUST BE SAID IT'S SIEVE IT IT'S I'VE SAID IN MY WILL THAT I WANT MY ASHES TO BE SCATTERED ON BARBER WATER
I SAID THIS BLITHELY HIM MY OIL AND SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE COULD BE PROBLEMS FIRST OF ALL THE ASHES MIGHT NOT BE ALLOWED ON THE PLANE AT THE SEINE SECONDLY AUSTRALIA'S PROBABLY WON'T LIFT THEM OFF COS IT'S ORGANIC MATERIAL THIRD THIRD OF THE CITY AUTHORITIES HAVE AN ORDNANCE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SCAB OVER AND SO ON I'M UP AGAINST IT THEY MAY HAVE TO BE A SECRET BURIAL PARTY AT DEAD OF NIGHT AT THIS RATE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TIME TO MAKE A NEW WELL THAT'S THE IMPONDERABLE
AND THAT'S WHERE WHAT MEDICAL SCIENCE COMES IN AND THAT'S WHERE LUCK COMES HERE I WAS BORN AT THE RIGHT TIME BECAUSE WHEN MY MY LEUKAEMIA CAME OUT A REMISSION NOT LONG AGO THERE WAS A DRUG READY TO FIGHT IT AND IF I COME OUT EARLIER I WOULD HAVE BEEN A GONER AND YOU'RE STILL WRITING YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN BUSINESS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WHICH IS LIKE AGAIN IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO IF I WAS A TAP DANCER I'LL BE THROUGH BY NOW
YOU TAP DANCE ON THE PAGE INSTEAD YES EXACTLY THAT EXACT A BIG INFLUENCE ON MY OF MY WRITING ESPECIALLY THE BALLERINAS
WHAT YOU PICK UP IN THE POEM IS THE VITALITY OF PROUST BE THE BREADTH OF IT THE RANGE OF REFERENCE THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE OF LIFE
IT FEELS READING THIS AS IF YOU SENSE THAT COMMOTION AS PROFOUNDLY WITH AS MUCH EXCITEMENT AS YOU EVER DID
THAT'S MORE THAN I EVER DID BECAUSE BEING ILL CAN FINE REALLY TO THE HOUSE HAS HELPED ME TO CONCENTRATE AND THINK BACK
IT SAYS MY MEMORY'S MORE CAREFULLY BUT YES I STILL HAVE THE VARIETY OF LIATH OF WONDERFUL THING MACNEICE COS SAID ABOUT LIFE BEING INCORRIGIBLE INCORRIGIBLY PLURAL DID STRIKES ME MORE THAN EVER AS I'M GETTING READY TO LEAVE
AS WELL AS GATE OF LILACS THE COLLECTED POEMS IS OUT HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT SIFTING THEM WHAT DO THEY REMIND YOU OF WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU
I WENT THROUGH ALL MY BOOKS OF BULBS SO WITH THE PRELIMINARY VOW THAT I WOULD KEEP ONLY THOSE POEMS THAT I REALLY HAD TO WRITE THE INSISTED ON BEING WRITTEN THAT WOULDN'T LET ME GO UNTIL THEY WERE DONE AND IT'S STILL QUITE A HEFTY BOOK I HAD TO SAY BUT I COULD READ WITH THE FIRST POEM I EVER PUBLISHED
AND IT'S REALLY FORECASTING THE END DERMOT BUT I MAY HAVE A PROPENSITY THAT WAY IT WAS CALL AS I SEE
AS I SEE YOU CRYSTALS GROW LEAVES HIM ROSA'S FLOW AS I TOUCH YOU TABLES TURNED TOWERS LANE WITCHES BURN AS I LEAVE YOU LENSES SHIVER FLAGS
SHOW'S OVER CLIVE JAMES UNTIL WE MEET NEXT TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH
BUT IT WAS OF COURSE THE TIME IS IT QUARTER TO EIGHT AND IT IS TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND ROB MARSHALL MORNING ROB GOOD MORNING JOB WHERE WAS THE LAST TIME I WONDER LISTENERS WENT FOR A WALK IN THE LOCAL PARK I IMAGINE FOR MANY OF YOU IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU LIVE BUT FOR MILLIONS OF URBAN DWELLERS PARKS REMAIN OFTEN ON SONG VITAL PATCHES OF OPEN SPACE
WHERE PEOPLE MEET CHILDREN PLAY AND HOPEFULLY WELL BEHAVED DOGS CAN HAVE A FIELD DAY SO I'VE BEEN LISTENING RATHER UNEASILY ALL WEEK TO THE ONGOING DEBATE ABOUT THIRD PARTY ORGANISATIONS OR INDIVIDUAL FUSING PARKS AS VENUES FOR ORGANISED EVENTS WHICH THEN HAVE OBVIOUS KNOCK ON EFFECTS FOR LOCAL COUNCILS AND AUTHORITIES IN TERMS OF COST
IN THAT DEBATE I'VE HEARD THE PARKS ARE FOR EVERYONE I'M SURELY ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO GET PEOPLE TOGETHER DOING EXERCISE TO COMBAT OBESITY TO GET THEM AWAY FROM THEIR ELECTRONIC GADGETS SHOULD BE APPLAUDED WELL YES YES BUT THE FABIAN SOCIETY RECENTLY WARNED THAT SPENDING ON PUBLIC PARKS IS LIKELY TO DROP WHILST THE COST OF MAINTAINING THEM OF COURSE IT'S NOT CHEAP
IN MY FORMER PARISH IN EAST LONDON EAST HAM CENTRAL PARK WAS A REAL COMMUNITY HOB THE SUNDAY AFTERNOON CHILDREN'S FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT WITH YOUNG PLAYERS FROM EVERY CONCEIVABLE FAITH AND ETHNICITY THE ASIAN WOMEN'S EXERCISE CLASS IN THE ROSE GARDEN AND THE THREE JOGGING SIKHS WHO WAVED AT ME EVERY MORNING AT SIX O'CLOCK THERE'S A BOXER DOG LET ME ROUND THE PARK EVERY RACE EVERY CREED ALL OF HUMAN LIFE WERE A IN GOD'S CREATION SIMPLY BY BEING OUTSIDE
IT CERTAINLY MADE THE ICECREAM QUEUE VERY INTERESTING IN FACT I'D GO AS FAR AS TO SAY THE PARKS ARE VITAL TO THEIR SPIRITUAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF MANY URBAN AREAS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT WHERE MUCH OF THE ACTION TAKES PLACE OF COURSE OUT OF DOORS JESUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS FREQUENTLY ADJOURNED TO OPEN COMMON LAND INCLUDING OF COURSE THE FAMOUS SMALL PARK NOW KNOWN AS THE GARDEN OF GET SEMONE AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNT OF OLIVES
BACK IN EAST LONDON I HAD THE BEST CONVERSATION OF A LOCAL PRIEST WITH LONG SERVING PARK KEEPER ERIC WHO WOULD WORK FROM DAWN TILL DUSK WITH HIS COLLEAGUES KEEPING THIS VITAL COMMUNITY SPACE FREE FROM LITTER BEAUTIFULLY CUT AND PRESERVED WELCOMING EVERYONE AND I ALWAYS WENT HOME TOTALLY FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR THAT ON SOME WORKING KEEP IN THIS SPACE BEAUTIFUL AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL
THEY CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHY THE ROYAL PARKS AND SOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE STARTED TO LEVY CHARGES FOR A SHOW OF ANY COMMERCIAL INCOME OF SUBSIDIES GRANTED TO THIRD PARTIES WHO USE THE PARK'S AS THEIR THEATRE FOR ACTION IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY FEELS RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING OUR PARKS IN GOOD SHAPE AND OPEN T'WALL
THE LOSS OF THEM WOULD BE DEVASTATING IT'S A PARADOX THAT THE ACTUAL PHRASE IT'S A WALK IN THE PARK SUGGESTS THAT SOMETHING IS EASY STRAIGHTFORWARD NICE EVEN LONG MAY THAT CONTINUE
THAT WAS THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR ROB MARSHALL
THAT I WAS ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT A COMEDIAN MAY BE PROSECUTED IN GERMANY WITH THE APPROVAL OF CHANCELLOR MERKEL FOR HAVING BEEN RUDE ABOUT A POLITICIAN IN THIS CASE THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY SEEMS A LITTLE ARMED RIGHT SO THAT THAT'S WHAT COMEDIANS DO JENNY HILL IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN BERLIN BUT A BACKGROUND ON THIS JOURNEY THIS MAN MADE HER DISOBLIGING REFERENCES TO PRESIDENT WEREN'T IN A SIR TERRIBLE POEM RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT HE WAS VERY RUDE ABOUT MISTER OUT OF ONE AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME AND BY THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN SUMMONED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS OVER SIMILAR SKETCHES WHICH WHAT'S A TYPICAL AND WERE POKING FUN AT MAKING A VERY SERIOUS POINT ABOUT PRESS FREEDOMS IN TURKEY NOW THIS LATEST EPISODE INVOLVED MISTER BERMAN AND HE'S VERY POPULAR BUT VERY CONTROVERSIAL LATE LIKE COMEDIAN
READING OUT A POEM WHICH WAS VERY RUDE AND WHICH IN EFFECT CONTRAVENED A VERY OLD LAW WHICH STOPS GERMANS FROM AND BEING RUDE AND INSULTING ABOUT FOREIGN LEADERS NO IT'S A VERY HISTORIC LAW IT'S NOT BEEN USED VERY OFTEN BUT YESTERDAY
CAUSING OUTRAGE AS SHE DID SO MISSUS MERKEL ANGLER MERKEL SAID THAT SHE WAS GOING TO ALLOW THIS MAN TO BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED UNDER GERMAN LAW AT THE BEHEST OF MISTER ATTA ONE SO IT WON'T BE DOWN TO THE PROSECUTORS TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PRESS CHARGES WHEN IT DID IT SHE CAN MAKE THE DECISION
SHE HAS AN EFFECT LET THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTORS TAKE THIS OVER AND BEGIN PROCEEDINGS AND THAT AND IT'S AS I SAY A VERY VERY CONTROVERSIAL DECISION IT'S
YOU MUSTN'T UNDERESTIMATE ACTUALLY THE DAMAGE THAT THIS COULD DO TO THE POLITICAL SCENE IN GERMANY BUT IN PARTICULAR TO MISSUS MERKEL AND THE PAPERS THIS MORNING ARE FULL OF OUTRAGE MISSUS MERKEL IN FAIRNESS AS ONE BOARD SHE PUTS IT HE'S REALLY STUCK BETWEEN HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN PLAGUE AND CHOLERA TURKEY IS OF COURSE A KEY ALLY SHE SEES TURKEY IS THE WAY FORWARD AS A SOLUTION ON TIME TO THE MIGRANT CRISIS
AT THE SAME TIME GERMANS HOLD THE PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION FREEDOM OF THE PRESS FREEDOM OF SPEECH VERY VERY DEAR FOR OBVIOUS HISTORICAL REASONS AND MISSUS MERKEL IS REALLY SEEN HERE AS HAVING TURNED HER BACK ON THOSE AND KOWTOWING TO TO MY WONDER HOW HAS SHE JUSTIFIED IT IF INDEED SHE HAS
THIS IS THE REALLY STRANGE THING AS SHE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO ALLOW THIS TO GO AHEAD AND UPSETTING HER COALITION PARTNERS THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AND IN THE PROCESS SHE WENT ON TO SAY THAT ACTUALLY ONCE SHE ALLOWS THIS CRIMINAL PROCEEDING TO TAKE PLACE SHE'S ALSO GOING TO SCRAP THIS HISTORICAL LAW
UNDER WHICH IS CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS ARE ABLE TO GO AHEAD CONCENTRATE MUCH DERIDED FOR THAT IT IS IT IS A BIT OF A PICKLE BUT AS I SAY I DON'T THINK YOU CAN UNDERRATE ESTIMATE THE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS MISSUS MERKEL LOST A LOT OF POPULARITY OVER HER REFUGEE POLICY BUT YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL HELD HER UP WITH SOME SORT OF BE GRUDGING RESPECT BECAUSE SHE APPEARED TO BE A LEADER WHO WAS ACTING ON HER PRINCIPLES OR SOMEONE WHO SET HERSELF UP AS A MORAL LEADER WITHIN EUROPE
SHE'S APPEARING TO TURN HER BACK ON THOSE PRINCIPLES NOW AND THAT'S VERY UPSETTING FOR THE ELECTORATE HERE THANKS JENNY LET'S TURN NOW TO PROFESSOR TIMOTHY GARTON ASH HE'S A PROFESSOR OF EUROPEAN STUDIES AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY'S OFFERED PRESENTS THE RADIO FORCES OR DE PRESENT OF FREE SPEECH GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
WELL IT'S BIZARRE AND OUTRAGEOUS THIS LAW ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO IMPERIAL GERMANY IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN PEOPLE WERE PROSECUTED LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE HAVE BEEN RUDE ABOUT THE KAISER THAT COURTESY WITH EXTENDED TO FOREIGN HEADS OF STATE
AND SO IN THAT SENSE PERHAPS THE KAISER WAS TO BLAME FOR ANGELA MERKEL'S DIFFICULT WHAT IS IT HE'S IN AN ARCADE REMAINDER IN THE GERMAN LAW AND WHAT THE GERMAN LAW SAYS IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT
HAS TO GIVE PERMISSION FOR THE PROSECUTOR TO TAKE OVER THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS SO THAT WOULD BE A PROSECUTION THEY MIGHT DECIDE THAT THEY WILL GO AHEAD WITH IT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT BUT SHE HAD THE POSSIBILITY OF SAYING NO THIS SHOULDN'T GO AHEAD WITH WHAT I THINK SHE SHE SHOULD'VE DONE AND OF COURSE AS YOUR CORRESPONDENT SAID I MEAN IN A WAY IT'S RATHER LIKE A STORY THIS WEEK WITH
A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS HOLDING BACK A COLOURFUL STORY ABOUT JOHN WITH HIS PRIVATE LIFE IT MAY BE THAT THE TABLOID EDITORS WERE JUST PILLARS OF VIRTUE AND SELF RESTRAINT SECOND ONLY TO SAINT FRANCIS IT'S POSSIBLE
BUT THE SUSPICION IS THAT THEY WANTED TO HANG ON TO A CULTURE SECRETARY WHO WAS NOT GOING TO REGULATE THE PRESS TO STRICTLY SIMILARLY HERE IT MAY BE AN EVEN MORE PLAUSIBLY THAT ANGELA MERKEL WAS SIMPLY FOLLOWING LEGAL PUNCTILIOUS SHOW ENFORCING A LAW THAT ACTUALLY SHE WANTS TO REPEAL WITH THE SUSPICION MUST BE ABOUT THAT SHE IS SO DESPERATE
TO GET HELP FROM ADDER JUAN TO STEM THE FLOW OF REFUGEES THE CHEESE SACRIFICING THE VALUE OF FREE SPEECH TO THE IMMEDIATE NATIONAL INTEREST
ON THE REFUGEE CRISIS AND OF COURSE IT IS MORE THAN JUST A NATIONAL INTEREST ISN'T IT I MEAN THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT CRISES AT THE DOORS OF EUROPE AND IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION BETWEEN OFFENDING A PRINCIPLE OF FREE SPEECH
AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE SAYING THIS AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE I'M GOING TO GET RID OF THE LAW A DECISION BETWEEN THAT AND OFFENDING A MAN WHO IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL DISTASTEFUL MANY PEOPLE THOUGH HE MAY BE PRESIDENT WELL MAYBE YOU CAN JUSTIFY WHAT SHE'S DONE
I THINK IT'S CRUDE JOHN THAT WE ALL OF US WESTERN DEMOCRACIES ARE GOING TO FACE THESE CONFLICTS BETWEEN OUR INTERESTS
AND A VALUE MOVES MORE OFTEN IN FUTURE AS WE BECOME RELATIVELY LESS POWERFUL IN THE WORLD I HOWEVER THINK THAT THIS WAS NOT NECESSARY BUT FROM THE WORD GO I MEAN VERY UNFORTUNATELY HER SPOKESMAN REPORTED
HAVING TOLD AIRED A ONE IN A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION THAT THIS POEM WAS DELIBERATELY INSULTING AND I READ THE PAPER AND I WATCHED A VIDEO IT'S CLEARLY A PIECE OF ABSOLUTELY LEGITIMATE POLITICAL SATIRE I THINK HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU SO I THINK THAT WE WOULD HAVE IT JUST AS THAT INTO THE POT WHAT WOULD WE THE B. B. C. FOR INSTANCE HAD BEEN PREPARED TO RUN THIS POEM
I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION INTERPRET IT THAT'S PRETTY O.K. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE SAY NO WAY WITH THE B.B.C. HAVE RUN IT I THINK IT'S JUST POSSIBLE YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A LITTLE DIFFICULTY ALTHOUGH HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU IS PRETTY OUT THERE I DON'T WORK YOU'VE GOT A PUBLISHABLE IN PRIVATE EYE BUT BUT BUT BUT IT WAS SIGNALLED WITH LETTERS TEN FOOT TALL THIS IS POLITICAL SATIRE
AND I THINK SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE ANY COMPROMISE ON IT SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE THEN YOU SAY THE THIS CLASH THE DIFFICULT INTERESTS AND VALUES WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE I THINK AND PARTICULARLY IN THE WORLD WHICH I WROTE ABOUT MY NEW BOOK ON FREE SPEECH WE WERE ALL BECOMING NEIGHBOURS EVERYONE CAN SEE WHAT'S SAID IN EVERYBODY ELSE'S COUNTRY AND GET OFFENDED BY IT
WE IN WESTERN DEMOCRACIES HAVE TO HOLD THE LINE AND SAY WE'RE PREPARED TO COMPROMISE ON SOME THINGS BUT WE'RE NOT PREPARED TO COMPROMISE ON THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUE OF FREE SPEECH DO YOU THINK IT'S DAMAGED ANGELA MERKEL HERSELF YES I DO AND I THINK IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE I MEAN HISTORICALLY ANGLER MACKEREL HAS BEEN A MODEL
OF CAUTION AND TACTICAL SKILL AND CAREFUL WORDING SHE THREW THAT OVER LAST SUMMER WITH THE REFUGEES AND HERE AGAIN I THINK SHE'S MADE A MIS STEP AND THIS SPOKESMAN AND I THINK IT YOU KNOW WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF ANGLER MACKEREL BUT I THINK I COULD TAKE A LONG TIME THAT THANKS FOR THAT AND JENNY IF YOU'RE STILL THERE THE DAMAGE TO HER SHORT TERM LONG TERM
HUGELY SIGNIFICANT ACTION LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THERE'S A GENERAL ELECTION HERE NEXT YEAR YOU KNOW ONE OF HER SENIOR POLITICIAN SAID TO ME A WHILE AGO HE WAS VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HER DOGGED DETERMINATION TO PURSUE A DEAL WITH TURKEY AGAINST ALL COSTS AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT BORN OUT HERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMENTATORS WHO HERE WHO ARE SAYING THAT SHE JUST ABOUT SCRAPED THROUGH THE MIGRANT CRISIS THIS ACTUALLY COULD BE THE THING THAT DOES FOR HER POLITICALLY

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE SIXTEENTH OF APRIL THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING POPE FRANCIS IS VISITING THE GREEK ISLAND OF LES BOSS WHERE HE WILL MEET MIGRANTS WHO COULD BE DEPORTED UNDER THE CONTROVERSIAL DEAL BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND TURKEY
A RESCUE OPERATION IS UNDERWAY IN SOUTHERN JAPAN AFTER TWO EARTHQUAKES BROUGHT DOWN BUILDINGS AND TRIGGERED LANDSLIDES AND BORIS JOHNSON HAD SAID THAT IT WOULD BE HYPOCRITICAL AND BIZARRE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA TO WARN AGAINST BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS KATHY COOKS THEM POPE FRANCIS WILL VISIT THE GREEK ISLAND OF LES BOSS THIS MORNING TO SHOW HIS SUPPORT FOR MIGRANTS TRYING TO REACH EUROPE HE'S TRAVELLING WITH THE SPIRITUAL LEADER OF THE WORLD'S ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW
A SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIAL HAS STRONGLY CRITICISED A NEW AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE E.U. AND TURKEY SAYING IT TREATS MIGRANTS AS MERCHANDISE THAT CAN BE TRADED BACK AND FORTH MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY STUCK ON THE ISLAND WITH MANY FACING THE PROSPECT OF DEPORTATION FROM LES BOSS A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE HAWLEY
THIS IS A SHORT BUT HIGHLY SYMBOLIC VISIT DESIGNED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO WHAT THE VATICAN HAS DESCRIBED AS A DIFFICULT DRAMATIC SITUATION THE POPE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR COMPASSION TO BE SHOWN TO PEOPLE FLEEING TERROR TURMOIL AND HARDSHIP HE'LL BE HOPING HIS TRIP TO LES BOSS WILL STIR EUROPE'S CONSCIENCE IT COMES AS THE HANDLING OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS FACES INTENSE CRITICISM FROM AID AGENCIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS
THE POPE WILL MEET REFUGEES AT A CAMP WITH MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE AWAITING EITHER A SILENT OR DEPORTATION TO TURKEY AND NOW EFFECTIVELY INCARCERATED AND CONDITIONS AID WORKERS SAY A DEPLORABLE
THEN HOLD A CEREMONY TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO HAVE DIED TRYING TO REACH EUROPE'S SHORES THE POPE COMES HERE WITH A STRONG MORAL MESSAGE BUT NO SOLUTIONS
A SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION IS UNDERWAY IN SOUTHERN JAPAN FOLLOWING THE SECOND POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE IN LESS THAN THIRTY SIX HOURS AT LEAST NINETEEN PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE DIED IN THE LATEST QUICK BUT IT'S THOUGHT DOZENS MORE ARE TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE TWENTY THOUSAND TROOPS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO HELP FROM TOKYO A CORRESPONDENT RUPERT WINGFIELD HAYES
IT NOW LOOKS LIKE THE SIX POINT FOUR EARTHQUAKE THAT HIT KYUSHU ON THURSDAY NIGHT WAS ONLY THE PRECURSOR TO A MUCH BIGGER SHOCK THE SECOND QUAKE MEASURED SEVEN POINT THREE AND HAS DONE FAR MORE DAMAGE ROADS HAVE BEEN SEVERED HUNDREDS OF BUILDINGS DAMAGED INCLUDING A NUMBER OF MODERN HIGH RISE STRUCTURES
A HUGE LANDSLIDE HAS SEVERED A HIGHWAY AND BURIED A NUMBER OF HOUSES RESCUE OPERATIONS ARE STILL GOING ON AT SEVERAL SITES AND IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE MAY STILL BE TRAPPED
AFTERSHOCKS HAVE ALSO BEEN HITTING THE AREA SEVERAL TIMES AN HOUR THROUGH THE NIGHT AND INTO THIS MORNING
THE DEATH TOLL IS SO FAR MERCIFULLY LOW FOR SUCH A LARGE QUAICH BUT PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY JITTERY AND WILL NOW BE EVEN MORE RELUCTANT TO RETURN HOME
THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID IT WOULD BE NAKEDLY HYPOCRITICAL FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO ARGUE IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE WHITE HOUSE HAS CONFIRMED THAT DURING HIS VISIT TO THE U.K. NEXT WEEK MY OBAMA WILL SO HE OFFERS ECONOMIC AND SECURITY BENEFITS MY JOHNSON HE'S ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE OFFICIAL OUT CAMPAIGN VOTE LEAVE SAID THE UNITED STATES ITSELF WOULD NOT DREAM OF SHARING DEMOCRACY HE'S BEEN STICKING TO OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA CAN SPARE
BORIS JOHNSON COULD HARDLY BE MORE DISMISSIVE OF THE ARGUMENTS BEING PUT FORWARD BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE I.M.F. THE BANK OF ENGLAND NATO AND EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE THE MAYOR OF LONDON SAID ECONOMIC CONCERNS ABOUT LEAVING THE E.U. WERE FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG ANDY CLAIMED THE UNION WAS CORRUPT
AND HE SAID THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LIKELY WARNINGS ABOUT DEPARTURE WOULD BE NAKEDLY HYPOCRITICAL I JUST FIND IT ABSOLUTELY BIZARRE THAT WERE BEING LECTURED BY THE AMERICANS ABOUT GIVING UP OUR SOVEREIGNTY AND GIVING UP CONTROL
WHEN THE AMERICANS WON'T EVEN SIGN UP TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA A LET ALONE THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT
REMAIN CAMPAIGN SOURCES SAY THOSE ARGUING TO LEAVE CAN'T ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC RISKS AND COUNT ATTRACT THE BACKING OF ANY THIRD PARTIES OF ANY STATURE WHEN PRESSED FOR ENDORSEMENTS TO RIVAL THE ENCAMP THE MAYOR OF LONDON STUMBLED
THE SENIOR CONSERVATIVE BACKBENCHER AND FORMER CHANCELLOR KEN CLARKE SAYS THE IDEA THAT DAVID CAMERON COULD REMAIN AS PRIME MINISTER IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS FARCICAL MY CAMERON SAID THIS WEEK THAT HE INTENDED TO STAY AND DOWNING STREET EVEN IF THE REFERENDUM VOTE ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD WENT AGAINST HIM BUT MISTER CLARKE WHO'S ALSO CAMPAIGNING TO STAY IN THE Y. YOU TOLD THE WEEK AT WESTMINSTER HERE ON RADIO FOUR THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WOULDN'T LAST THIRTY SECONDS IF THEY LOST
THE IDEA THAT DAVID CARRIED ON SAYING WHAT DESPITE WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS ARE GOING TO LEAD A GOVERNMENT WHICH IS GOING TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU ALL AND FIND OUT WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO NEGOTIATE THAT WILL DETERMINE NEW ARRANGEMENTS FOR OURSELVES AND OUR BUSINESSES AND FOR OUR INVESTORS THAT SECURE A NEW BASE FOR US IN THE GLOBALISED ECONOMY I MEAN IT'S JUST FARCICAL AND YOU CAN HEAR THE FULL INTERVIEW AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING

MISS NOT HEANEY WILL RAISE THESE ISSUES IN HER DISCUSSIONS HERE AS WELL AS WHAT'S SAID TO BE ONE OF HER MAJOR CONCERNS HOW TO BRING AN END TO SERIOUS PUNISHING WAR WHICH WOULD ALSO HELP RESOLVE EUROPE'S MIGRATION CRISIS
IRANIAN OFFICIALS SAY THEY ALSO WANT TO STRENGTHEN THIS RELATIONSHIP ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE TAKING PLACE IN TEHRAN TODAY IS STILL TRUE POLITICALLY SENSITIVE TO HAVE WITH THE UNITED STATES

THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS ABOUT TO BECOME A LITTLE BIT BIGGER AN EXPANDABLE ROOM IS DUE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE ORBITING LABORATORY TODAY THE HOPE IS THAT IT COULD PROVIDE A WAY OF MAKING CHEAPER SPACE MODULES FOR USE ABOVE EARTH THE MOON AND EVEN MARS AS OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN AMOS EXPLAINS THE PROJECT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY A PROPERTY ENTREPRENEUR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA
THE AMERICAN ROBERT BIGELOW BUILT HIS FORTUNE ON THE BACK OF A BUDGET HOTEL CHAIN AND HE'S NOW DETERMINED TO TAKE THAT ACCOMMODATION EXPERIENCE INTO ORBIT HE'S MANUFACTURING EXPANDABLE SPACE MODULES THAT USE A SUPER TOUGH FLEXIBLE POLYMER TO PROVIDE PROTECTION RATHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL METAL SHELLS ON EXISTING HABITATS
THE VESSEL TO BE ATTACHED TO THE SPACE STATION IS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN A PHONE BOOTH AND WILL UNDERGO TWO YEARS OF TESTING MY BIGELOW HAS PLANS FOR MODELS THAT ARE ONE HUNDRED TIMES BIGGER HE HOPES TO RENT THESE OUT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO USE THEM FOR SCIENCE THEY COULD EVEN BE HOTELS HE SAYS HIGH FLYING DESTINATIONS FOR ASTRONAUT TOURISTS EVENTS ARE TAKING PLACE THIS WEEKEND TO MARK THE SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BELFAST BLITZ IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE WHEN MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY GERMAN BOMBING RAIDS
TWO HUNDRED TONS OF EXPLOSIVES AND THIRTY THOUSAND INCENDIARIES WERE DROPPED IN THE WORST ATTACK MOST MISSED THE INTENDED TARGET THE CITY'S DOCKS AND LANDED ON TERRACED HOUSES WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN EVACUATED

INSTEAD HE WAS MEETING BUSINESS LEADERS WHILE SHE SAT IN ISOLATION ON A BENCH IN FRONT OF THE TAJ MAHAL DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES WHO UNDERSTOOD THE POWER OF IMAGERY SAID IT HAD BEEN A VERY HEALING EXPERIENCE
TWENTY FOUR YEARS ON FROM HIS MOTHER'S VISIT PRINCE WILLIAM WILL BRING HIS WIFE TO MARVEL AT THE WORLD HERITAGE SITE THE COUPLE HOPE SAY THEIR OFFICIALS TO CREATE SOME NEW MEMORIES PETE AREN'T REPORTING IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST EIGHT
SECOND EARTHQUAKE BIGGER THAN THE LAST ONE AND AFFECTING A MUCH WIDER AREA IT HIT THE CITY HAVE YET TO SHEARER IN SOUTHERN JAPAN IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING TROOPS ARE ON THE STREETS SEARCHING FOR PEOPLE AMONGST THE RUBBLE FIRES ARE STILL BURNING THERE HAVE BEEN LANDSLIDES IN THE JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER HAS WARNED THAT HEAVY RAIN TODAY COULD TRIGGER SERIOUS MUDSLIDES
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO YES SHEARERS SHEENI HE'S MANAGER AT THE INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RELIEF DEPARTMENT OF THE JAPANESE RED CROSS HAKUNA MA TO HOSPITAL HE STARTED BY DESCRIBING LAST NIGHT'S EARTHQUAKE OBJECT
HEY LOOK AT THAT GRIP ON TALKED DARTBOARD AND HOW IS THE HOSPITAL HOPING ALL OF THEM BUT HOW DO YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL I'M
HE WILL BE UNDERWATER AND COME UP WITH HOT ROCKS ARE MADE BUT FOR MEDICAL HELP
AND THEY'RE VERY BIG LEAF
I THINK WE DID HE SPEAK OF LIMITED RESOURCES IN THE CITY I UNDERSTAND THERE IS YES NO WATER A LOT OF THE MOBILE PHONE NETWORK IS DOWN
IF THEY O.K. ABOUT TO APPLY TO BE HIT
BUT OF COURSE THE HOSPITAL HAS ITS OWN SUPPLIES HOW YES HOW MANY INJURED PEOPLE ARE YOU HAVING TO COPE WITH
TOTALLY GIGA POOR HUMBLE IT FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE
THAT'S A HUGE RUBBER COULD HAVE BETA WHAT
THERE MUST BE A WORRY THAT AS THE RUBBLE IS REMOVED AS GET DAMAGES SURVEYED THE NUMBERS WILL GO UP RATHER WRAP IT UP OR IT WILL BE
IF YOU STOOD ON THE STREET OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL IF YOU LOOKED AROUND YOUR CITY HOW MUCH DAMAGE WOULD YOU SEE I LIKE THAT AT ALL YOU NEED TO
WE COULD SEW A PAIN I WOULD
POOR PUDDY DARK ONLY
PETE UP ABOUT THAT I'VE GOT
WITH A POWER CUT AND WHEN THE LIGHT CAME HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO LOOK AT THE DAMAGE OUTSIDE I'D BE WHAT YOU HOT DOG I HAVEN'T LOOKED UP THE WHOLE OF DAMAGE

SO IF YOU'VE GOT A BIG IDIOT A MONTH OR SO YOU JUST HAVE TO HOPE THAT THE AFTERSHOCKS NOW AND I'VE GOT SERIOUS AND THAT THERE IS NOT ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE YEAH WE HOPE WITH YOU MY BETTER KISSES TO YOU AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY
THE TIME IS NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT SHOULD THE FUTURE CARE OF TWO HUNGARIAN CHILDREN BORN BROUGHT UP AND LIVING HERE BUT WITH HUNGARIAN PARENTS AND PASSPORTS BE DECIDED HERE OR IN HUNGRY SHOULD THEIR FUTURE WELLBEING BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BRITISH
OR THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE MONTHS OF LEGAL ARGUMENTS THE SUPREME COURT HAS DECIDED THAT THE ANSWER IS HERE IN THE U.K. WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF HUNGARIANS AND OF COURSE MANY OF THE EAST EUROPEANS TO LIVING HERE THAT COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS NOT JUST FOR THE BRITISH FAMILY COURTS BUT A CARE SYSTEM AS WELL WILL BE DEBATING THE FINDING IN THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES IN A SECOND THE FIRST ORRIBLE TO CENSURE BERG HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS CASE
YES THAT'S RIGHT NICK WILL EVERY YEAR IN ENGLAND HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN FROM SO CALLED EIGHT EIGHT ACCESSION COUNTRIES THAT'S POLAND LITHUANIA SLOVAKIA AND SO ON ARE SUBJECT TO CARE PROCEEDINGS IN ENGLISH COURT OFTEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES BY SOCIAL WORKERS WHO WERE WORRIED ABOUT NEGLECT AND ABUSE THE NUMBERS ARE NOT SURPRISING PERHAPS GIVEN THE SHEER NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM THESE COUNTRIES HAVE ARRIVED IN RECENT YEARS FAMILY COURT ALWAYS TRY TO PLACE A CHILD WITH ITS EXTENDED FAMILY FIRST THAT'S WHY THEY TRY TO TRANSFER THESE CASES WHERE APPROPRIATE
BACK TO THE FAMILY'S COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IN THIS CASE THE PARENTS HAD MOVED FROM HUNGARY TO BRITAIN IN TWENTY ELEVEN IN SEARCH OF A NEW LIFE THE FATHER TOLD ME THEIR FIRST LITTLE GIRL WAS BORN IN TWENTY TWELVE A YEAR LATER THE MOTHER GAVE BIRTH TO THEIR SECOND DAUGHTER AT HOME THEY WERE LIVING IN ONE ROOM IN REALLY SQUALID CONDITIONS THE FATHER'S WORDS ARE SPOKEN BY ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS WE WERE LIVING IN A ROOM WITHOUT A BED IT HAD TO BE TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS FULL OF BUGS
WE HAD NO FRIDGE EITHER IT HAD BROKEN DOWN SO WE HAD TO BUY FOOD EVERY DAY WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY THE CONDITIONS WERE TERRIBLE BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY COULDN'T HELP US KEEP OUR GIRLS HELP US TAKE THEM BACK TO HUNGARY
AND THEY WERE ALSO ALLEGATIONS MADE OF DOMESTIC ABUSE AGAINST THEIR FATHER THE GIRLS WERE TAKEN AWAY IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SECOND BABY WAS BORN AND PLACED WITH ENGLISH FOSTER PARENTS THE PARENTS WANTED THEIR CHILDREN BACK BUT MOVED TO HUNGARY BECAUSE THE MOTHER WAS PREGNANT AGAIN AND THEY DIDN'T WANT THEIR NEW BABY TAKEN AWAY IN ENGLAND THE LEGAL PROCESS WAS DELAYED THEN PROGRESS THROUGH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF COURT WHICH RULED THE CASE SHOULD GO TO HUNGARY THAT'S WHAT THE PARENTS WANTED EVEN THOUGH THE GIRLS WOULD GO TO A FOSTER FAMILY
HOWEVER THE SUPREME COURT HAS NOW DECIDED THE CASE SHOULD BE HEARD IN ENGLAND THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE THE JUDGES RULED IF THE CASE WERE TRANSFERRED THE GIRLS WOULD HAVE TO MOVE TO THAT WOULDN'T BE IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS AS THEY'RE VERY WELL SETTLED THEIR FATHER IS UNHAPPY
FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS I'VE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THE GIRLS WOULD COME BACK TO HUNGARY THE WHOLE FAMILY BELIEVE THE GIRLS WERE COMING BACK INSTEAD TIME IS PASSING THAT'S STILL IN ENGLAND
THEY DON'T EVEN SPEAK HUNGARIAN I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THE SUPREME COURT JUDGEMENT HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE TWO MORE CHILDREN NOW THEY HAVE A NEW BABY DESPITE THE ENGLISH CASE THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT TROUBLED THEM HE SAID
THE SUPREME COURT HASN'T DECIDED THE OUTCOME JUST WHERE THE CASE WILL BE HEARD NONETHELESS LAWYERS HAVE TOLD ME IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CASE WHO DEFECT DECISIONS IN THE LOWER COURTS AND AS I SAID AT THE OUTSET THERE ARE NOW MANY SIMILAR CASES EVERY YEAR THANKS ANJA WELL YOU MENTION LAWYERS AND INDEED WE'VE GOT LAWYERS HERE TO DISCUSS JUST THAT FRANK FEUM Q.C. IS THE BARRISTER ACTING ON BEHALF
OF THE FATHER HE HEARD QUOTED THERE AND MIRROR MOLARS HERE TO FOUNDER AND SENIOR LAWYER AT THE AT THE AIR CENTRE SURE IS INTERESTED IN THESE SORTS OF CASES DESCRIBES ITSELF AS A SPECIALIST CHARITIES MISSION IS TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF EUROPEAN LAW RIGHTS AND ASSIST MARGINALISED INDIVIDUALS NOSE AND VULNERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES SO TO RUSH IT TWISTS THOSE RIGHTS IS QUITE LOW WHERE DID YOU GET THE PICTURE OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY
IS ALL ABOUT PRINT FIN WE HEARD THE ANGUISHED THERE OF THE FATHER HE'S EXPECTATION JUST PUT VERY SIMPLY WAS HUNGARIAN CHILDREN HUNGARIAN PASSPORT WILL EVENTUALLY IF NOT BY US BE BROUGHT UP IN HUNGARY YES THAT'S RIGHT AND I SPOKE TO HIM EARLIER THIS WEEK AND THE WHOLE FAMILY'S VERY SADDENED BY THE OUTCOME
THEY DESPERATELY WANT TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN BACK AND OF COURSE THIS CREATES MORE DELAY BEFORE THE OUTCOME AS FINALLY MAN BUT EVEN IF THEY CAN'T HAVE THEIR CHILDREN BACK THEY WOULD RATHER SEE THEM BROUGHT UP WHAT WITHIN THE HUNGARIAN CARE SYSTEM OR BY FAMILY OR FRIENDS WELL YES THEY WOULD AND THE JUDGE AT FIRST INSTANCE IN THIS CASE WAS IMPRESSED BY THE NEED FOR THESE CHILDREN TO HAVE CONTACT WITH THEIR WIDER FAMILY AND ALL OF THEIR WIDER FAMILY IS IN HUNGARY NULA NULA MOULDY COUNTER ARGUMENT PRESUMABLY IS QUITE SIMPLY
BROUGHT BORN HERE BROUGHT UP HERE EFFECTIVELY BRITISH CHILDREN ALL THEY'VE GOT HUNGARIAN PASSPORTS AND THEREFORE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR COURTS NOT GUESSES
WELL IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A WHOLLY EXCEPTIONAL NOT EXCEPTIONAL IN THE SENSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT HAS TO BE AN EXCEPTION FOR PROCEEDINGS WHICH ARE U.K. COURT IS CONDUCTING TO BE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION
AND THESE CHILDREN WERE ACTUALLY VOLUNTARILY GIVEN UP SOCIAL SERVICES BY THE UNFORTUNATE PARENTS WHO FOUND THEMSELVES AND IN THAT CONDITION TO DESCRIBED OF NOT BEING ABLE TO CARE FOR THEM
PROPERLY ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ISSUES IS THAT THIS JUDGEMENT IS NOT DECIDING WHERE THESE CHILDREN WILL GO IT'S DECIDING WHICH COURT WILL MAKE THE DECISIONS AND AS THE SUPREME COURT JUDGEMENT WAS VERY CLEAR TO POINT OUT THE BRITISH COURTS WHEN THEY REVISIT THE FACTUAL SITUATION NOW COULD WELL DECIDE THAT A PLACEMENT IN HUNGARY IS IN THE CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS
REALLY BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE ASSUME ONCE THEY BECOME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BRITISH LEGAL SYSTEM THE LIKELIHOOD SHORTLY IS THAT THE BRITISH CARE SYSTEM WILL BE EXPECTED TO LOOK AFTER THEM AND THEN EAT THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE SUPREME COURT VERY CLEARLY SAID IN THIS CASE AND DOES YOUR CLIENT EXCEPT THAT THERE IS STILL HOPE AS FAR AS HE SEES THE POSSIBILITY OF THEM BEING A RETURN TO HUNGRY HE STILL HAS HOPE
OF COURSE BEING IN HUNGARY NOT SPEAKING ENGLISH AND NOT KNOWING A SYSTEM AND CERTAINLY COMING FROM A COUNTRY WHERE THEIR RECENT HISTORY IS TO DISTRUST OF AUTHORITY
THAT HOPE IS NOT PERHAPS EXPECTATION AT THIS STAGE LET'S WIDEN IT BEYOND THIS CASE HOW MANY CASES LIKE THIS ARE THERE THAT MIGHT BE AS A SIGNAL WE ARE TALKING WHAT A FEW HUNDREDS LOW HUNDREDS I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO I WAS IN COURT ONLY THE OTHER WEEK WHERE A JUDGE SAID TO ME THAT THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO WE HADN'T EVEN HEARD OF ARTICLE FIFTEEN OF THIS REGULATION I AM OUR SERIOUS CASES COMING THROUGH FAIRLY REGULARLY THERE WILL BE A WORRIED THERE'LL BE SOME PEOPLE LIST DO YOU THINK
THIS IS YET MORE OF A BURDEN ON THE BRITISH TAXPAYER IS A BURDEN ON THE BRITISH COURT AS A BURDEN ON THE BRITISH CARE SYSTEM AND IF THEY ARE YOU KNOW THEY A HUNGARIAN CHILDREN BY PASSPORT AND PARENTAGE WHY ISN'T IT THE RESPONSIBILITY THEY'LL GARRON AUTHORITIES TO DEAL WITH IT IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHY ISN'T IT THE RESPONSIBILITY IT'S OF THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES
IT'S WOOD TO HUNGARIAN WOULD YOU TRANSFER OF THESE PROCEEDINGS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY NOW OF THE BRITISH LEGAL SYSTEM BE IN THOSE CHILDREN'S INTERESTS THAT RAISES A FASCINATING QUESTION OF DIFFERING STANDARDS DOESN'T IT ON THE ONE HAND OF COURSE BECAUSE WE'RE ALL IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THERE ARE SHARED STANDARDS BUT IN REALITY THERE MAY BE THINGS THAT ARE PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE IN HUNGARY IN TERMS OF THE WAY CHILDREN ARE BROUGHT UP
WHICH ARE NOT AND WOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS ACCEPTABLE IT HERE IN THE U.K. ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WAS MADE IN THE SUPREME COURT WAS THAT A LEVEL OF LIFE WHICH IN THIS COUNTRY WE CONSIDER AS POVERTY STRICKEN ISN'T NECESSARILY SO CONSIDERED IN HUNGARY OR OTHER PLACES WHERE THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING IS NOT AS HIGH AS HOUSE
SO THERE ARE IN A SENSE DIFFERING STANDARDS THEY'RE THERE A MINIMUM SHARE STANDARDS OF DEMOCRACY AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND SO ON JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE TALK WE'RE TALKING OF A VERY VERY POOR FAMILY INDEED HERE YES ABSOLUTELY AND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THIS COUNTRY WERE TERRIBLE YEAH AND I THINK THE REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE IS NOT
TO CRITICISE THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE HUNGARIAN ANY HUNGARIAN SYSTEM THAT WAS EXPRESSLY UNDERLINED IN THEIR JUDGEMENT AND IN OTHER JUDGEMENTS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER ON THE FACTS OF THIS PARTICULAR CASE
THE HUNGARIAN COURTS WOULD BE BETTER PLACED TO ACT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THE HUNGARIANS WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO DO IS TO MAKE AN ORDER FOR THE CHILDREN TO STAY WITH THEIR CURRENT FOSTER PRENT THE CONCERN OF THE SUPREME COURT WAS THAT THESE CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BY DEFINITION
BY THE TRANSPORT BE UPROOTED FROM THEIR FAMILIES WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SINCE BUT US AND SENT TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION
BUT THAT ONE WOULDN'T PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT AN ENGLISH COURT EXAMINING ALL THE DETAILS MIGHT CONSIDER THAT THIS COULD BE A POSSIBILITY YOUR MUM AND FRANK FIENNES AND OF COURSE THEN SHE BETTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THAT EARNEST TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT
EMILY'S BOMBERS CARRIED OUT AN ATTACK LASTING SEVERAL HOURS OVER AN AREA COVERING PRACTICALLY THE WHOLE OF THE HALL
THE INTENSITY OF THE EFFECTS VARY IN SOME AREAS VINCE WAS VICIOUS AND THEN DISCRIMINATE AND MINUTE BOMBS FELL ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY FROM FLU REMEDY REPORTS OF THE SPHERE OF THE MAY HAVE MAYBE HEAVEN
HEAVY THEY WERE PHILIP IS AUTHOR HISTORIAN JOINS US FROM BELFAST GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING ALTOGETHER MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND IT WAS A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES AND THE CITY SEEMED COMPLETELY UNPREPARED FOR IT YES WELL THERE WERE THREE MAIN RATES THROUGHOUT APRIL AND MAY NINETEEN FORTY ONE BUT THE HEAVIEST BY FAR WAS AN EASTER TUESDAY NIGHT
AND I SUPPOSE THE STRONGMEN GOVERNMENT BACK THEN NEVER KNOWN FOR ITS ENERGETIC BEHAVIOUR IN ANY CASE I HOPED AND BELIEVED THAT THE RAIDS THAT HAD COME TO LIVERPOOL AND GLASGOW WOULDN'T CROSS THE IRISH SEA SO THERE WAS A LACK OF SHELTERS THERE WAS A LACK OF ANTI AIRCRAFT GUNS FIGHTERS TO TAKE ON THE LUFTWAFFE KNOW SEARCH LIGHTS NO PROPER EVACUATION PLAN SO THE CITY WAS REALLY QUITE NAKED
WHENEVER THE LUFTWAFFE ARRIVED ON THE EASTER TUESDAY NIGHT PROBABLY WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PLANES AND THEY BOMBED THE CITY FOR SOMETHING LIKE FOUR OR FIVE HOURS' SLEEP INDUCING PANIC AS YOUR REPORTERS ARE READY SAID THE THE THE REASON THAT I SUPPOSE THE LUFTWAFFE CAME TO BELFAST WAS BECAUSE OF INDUSTRIAL SHORTEN HIGHLANDS FACTORY THE DOCKYARDS THE DOCKYARDS I ALSO PRODUCE SCENE IN SHORTEN HARDENS THE STIRLING BOMBER
SO THERE WAS REASON TO COME TO BELFAST CERTAINLY FOR THE RIFFRAFF ARE BUT THE THING WAS A LOT OF OBSCURE CLOUD OVER THE CITY ARE AT VARIOUS STAGES AND THE BOMBS WERE BASICALLY DROPPED WHEREVER THE PILOT'S WISHED DON'T BECAUSE THAT'S THE THING I DID A PROGRAMME FOR B. B. C. LAST YEAR WE SIMULATED THAN A SORT OF BOMBING RUN
WHEN YOU'RE AIMING AT IN THIS GAME ONE OF THESE CASES CARDIFF ON THE DOCKS SMALL TARGET AND IF YOU DON'T GET IT RIGHT IF YOU HAD TO A MATTER OF SECONDS THEN THE BOMBS FALL ON PACKED TERRACED HOUSES WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED WELL IT DID INDEED THE NORTH AND THE WEST OF THE CITY IN PARTICULAR AND THE SCENES WERE REALLY QUITE BARBARIC AS THEY ALWAYS ARE WITH THE AERIAL BOMBARDMENT BUT THE
IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED AND THE HOURS THAT FOLLOWED EASTER TUESDAY ALL THESE BODIES WERE ASSEMBLED AND THE FALLS BATHS WERE DRAINED OF WATER SO THAT THEY COULD BE USED AS A MORTUARY SO YOU HAVE THIS GRIM THE SCENE OF BODY HAS BEEN LAID OR OFTEN VERY MUTILATED UNRECOGNISABLE SET OUT AND PEOPLE QUEUING UP FROM ALL ACROSS THE CITY JUST TO YOU KNOW TO TRY TO WORK OUT WAS THAT MY RELATIVE
WHAT WHAT WHAT ONE REALLY INTERESTING ASPECT OF IT ALL THERE WAS WHAT HAPPENED AFTERWARDS IN THE ATTITUDE OF OF THE SUBTLE USE OF DUBLIN BECAUSE OF COURSE THE OUTGUNNED THE IRELAND WAS NEUTRAL AT THE TIME
PARTLY THE REASON MAY BE WHY THE AUTHORITIES THOUGHT THEY WOULDN'T BOMB A COUNTRY SO CLOSE TO ANOTHER NEUTRAL GOING TO HOW DID IRELAND REACT TO THIS DID THEY HELP OH THEY DID THEY DID HELP MCDERMID WHO WAS THE MINISTER IN CHARGE OF SECURITY DURING THE BOMBING RAIDS IF YOU'RE HIS WIFE I THINK FOLD
OR D. FOR LIRE OR OF THE AUTHORITIES IN GIVEN EAR OF COURSE AND IF I SAID AT THE DINER ABSOLUTELY AND HE SENDS NORTH AT THIRTEEN OR SQUADS OF FIRE ENGINES FROM DON DOCTOR HOOD AND DUBHLAN SO THEY ARRIVED UP INTO THE CITY AND WERE VERY MUCH WELCOMED BUT A TERRIBLE SCENE GREETED THEM SO THERE WAS THAT TEMPORARY ALLY ANSWER I SUPPOSE DURING THE BOMBING RAIDS WELL WHAT AN INTERESTING STORY AND A VERY TRAGIC ONE AS YOU SAY PHILIP AW THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST DATES AND OLLIE'S HERE WITH A SPORTS MORNING TOMORROW MORNING IT'S A HUGE DAY FOR THE TEAMS AT THE WRONG END OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE WITH NORWICH HOSTING FELLOW STRUGGLE AS SUNDERLAND IN THE LUNCHTIME KICK OFF A WIN FOR NORWICH WOULD CONFIRM ASTON VILLA'S RELEGATION BEFORE THEY EVEN PLAY MANCHESTER UNITED AT THREE O'CLOCK MEAN A SECOND FROM BOTTOM NEWCASTLE HOST SWANSEA B.B.C. SPORTS CHIEF FOOTBALL WRITER FILM MCNULTY JOINS US MORNING PHIL NOT
I KNOW PERHAPS THEY'RE ALL MUST WIN GAMES AT THE BUSINESS END OF THE SEASON BUT TODAY FEELS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT FOR SOME TEAMS YES I THINK SO AND I THINK THE GAME AT CARROW ROAD CARRIES EXTRA IMPORTANCE AT THIS STAGE OF THE SEASON BECAUSE IF NORWICH WIN THEY WILL GO SEVEN POINTS CLEAR OF SUNDERLAND AND OBVIOUSLY IF SOMEONE CAN GET A WIN THAT WOULD LEAVE THEM A POINT BEHIND WITH A GAME IN HAND I THINK A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHEN NORWICH MANAGER ALEX NEIL MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLOTTING AWAY OUT OF RELEGATION
HE WOULD HAVE LOOKED TO TWO HOMES AGAINST NUKE TWO HOME GAMES AGAINST NEWCASTLE AND SUNDERLAND AS THE WAY THEY MIGHT DO IT THEY BEAT NEWCASTLE WITH A LAST MINUTE GOAL AND I THINK IF THEY BEAT SUNDERLAND TODAY THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY WILL THINK NEWCASTLE TODAY HE WILL THINK THAT THEY'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE FINISHING LINE AND IT COULD BE A SAD DAY FOR ASTON VILLA AND THEY'RE FOUL FANS AFTER TWENTY NINE YEARS IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE
YES IT'S BEEN A VERY VERY LONG DECLINED THIS SEASON IT'S THEY'VE SEEM TO BE IN TROUBLE ALMOST FROM SEPTEMBER THEY'VE HAD A MANAGER LEAVE THIS WEEK THEY'VE HAD TO SET A PLAYER GABY A BOMB THE WHORE ON A FITNESS COURSE IT JUST SUMS UP THE CHAOTIC NATURE OF THEIR SEASON AND THEN OF COURSE YOU CAN ALSO BRING NEWCASTLE UNITED INTO THE EQUATION THERE SIX POINTS FROM SAFETY RAFA BENITEZ HE'S HAD THREE LOSSES IN A DRAWER FROM HIS FIRST FOUR GAMES IT'S REACHED A POINT WHERE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO ANY HOME GOES PAST WITHOUT A WIN AND THEY WILL NEED THREE POINT TO GET SWANSEA CITY TODAY
AT THE OTHER END YOU'LL BE AT LEICESTER TOMORROW THEY'RE IN ACTION AGAIN PLAYING BEFORE TOTTENHAM ON MONDAY SO THE LEADERS COULD BE TEN POINTS AHEAD BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND YES IT'S A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO DO AS THEY DID LAST WEEK TO APPLY SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE TO TOTTENHAM TOTTENHAM DON'T PLAY UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT WHEN THEY TRAVEL TO STOKE A VERY TOUGH GAME AND OF COURSE IF LESTER CAN WIN TOMORROW THAT WILL GIVE THEM A TEN POINT ADVANTAGE AND ALSO LEAVE THEM NEEDING ONLY TWO MORE VICTORIES TO WIN THE LEAGUE
LESTER WENT FIRST LAST WEEK WHEN THEY WANT AT SUNDERLAND BUT SPURS RESPONDED WITH A FINE WIN AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED IT'LL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF CLAUDIO AND HIS TEAM CAN PUT THEM IN THAT SAME POSITION BY BEATING WEST HAM AND SUNDAY INDEED IT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FILMIC MELTY BRIGHTON COULD VERY WELL TAKE ASTON VILLA'S PLACE IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE THERE ONE POINT OFF THE TOP OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER BEATING FULHAM FIVE NIL WHILE FOURTH PLACE HULL DEFEATED WOLVES TO ONE

BACK AT MAURIER PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THEY SAY THEY'RE BEING KEPT IN A CAGE BUT WHAT TERRIFIES THE MOST IS WHAT MIGHT COME
POPE FRANCIS IS COMING TO SEE THEM AND WHAT HE BRINGS THEY SAY IS SOMETHING THAT SHE DESPERATELY SHORT SUPPLY HERE
SOPHIE LONG REPORTING THERE WHILE I'M DRAWING ON THE LINE BY CARDINAL VINCENT NICHOLS WHO'S AHEAD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN ENGLAND WAS OF COURSE THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY WESTMINSTER GOOD GOOD MONEY IF YOU CARDINAL GOOD MORNING TO YOU CHUCK THERE IS A DANGER IN THE SORT OF VISITORS AND AS WE HEARD FROM THOSE PEOPLE THE POPE WILL SAVE US HE WILL FIND A SOLUTION YOU'LL GIVE US HOPE HE CAN'T REALLY DO THAT CAN HE AT LEAST HE'S CAN'T FIND A SOLUTION
WELL HE'S NOT A POLITICIAN HE IS NOT A MAJOR LEADER BUT WHAT I THINK WHAT HE DOESN'T JUST WANT TO BRING OUR ATTENTION TO THIS AND IN A GENERAL SENSE HE WANTS US TO BEGIN TO LOOK AT THESE REFUGEES IN THE EYE
AND HE WANTS US TO SEE THEM AS THEY ARE NOT AS NUMBERS NOT AS MERCHANDISE OR TAHAR TERM BUT IF WE LOOK THEM IN THE EYE THEN IN A FAMOUS PHRASE THAT HE USES WE MIGHT LEARN AGAIN HOW TO WEEP AND THEN WHEN WE WEEP WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO
HE HAS BEEN DRAWING COMPARISONS AS INDEED HAVE YOU BETWEEN THE GENEROSITY OF INDIVIDUALS GIVING MONEY TO CHARITIES TO HELP THESE PEOPLE
AND THE RELATIVE LACK OF GENEROSITY AS SOME SEE IT FROM GOVERNMENTS
YES THAT'S TRUE FIND THE GENEROSITY OF PEOPLE AS REMARKABLE I JUST THINK OF THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TO THE GREEK ISLANDS WE'VE HAD INTERNATIONAL CARRIAGE TUSSLE ME HALF THE CATHOLIC WORLD I MENTION JUST TWO AND THE CHIEF RABBI FROM HERE HAS BEEN TO THE GREEK ISLANDS TO SEE HOW JEWISH CHARITABLE MONEY IS USED TO HELP THESE REFUGEES MOST OF WHOM ARE MUSLIMS
BUT YES IT'S TRUE I DON'T THINK THERE IS THIS WILLINGNESS IN THE HEART TO PEOPLE TO RESPOND BUT THE MECHANISMS ARE VERY DIFFICULT I UNDERSTAND OUR GOVERNMENT'S MOTIVATION IN WANTING TO BRING PEOPLE DIRECTLY FROM SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMPS AND TO DETER THEM FROM MAKING THESE HAZARDOUS JOURNEYS BUT IN THE FIRST MONTHS OF THIS PROGRAMME
BRITAIN HAS RECEIVED JUST UNDER TWO THOUSAND REFUGEES AND I'M AFRAID TWO THOUSAND I'M NOT EVER GOING TO BE PRETTY TOURER A DETERRENT FOR THE REST AND I BELIEVE THERE IS A GREATER WILLINGNESS IN THIS COUNTRY
TO RESPOND SO WHY DO YOU THINK THE POLITICIANS AREN'T RESPONDING WELL THEY'D MAKE POLITICAL JUDGEMENTS THEY MAKE JUDGEMENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE PUBLIC OPINION WILL RECEIVE THE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE NERVOUSNESS OF PEOPLE AS TO WHO MIGHT COME IN TO THE COUPLE ARE OF REFUGEES AND THAT'S WHERE AS I SAY THERE IS
THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY THAT ARE REALLY COMMENDABLE BUT I'VE SAID SURELY THAT COULD BE SPEEDED UP SURELY IN THE FIRST HERE WE CAN SEE REALLY HOW MANY COULD BE TAKEN AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT BY FIVE AND AT THE MOMENT IT'S GOING VERY SLOWLY AND IT'S A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AND IS THAT UNCHRISTIAN OF THEM
AND CHRISTIANITY DOESN'T PRESENT A MAJOR PRACTICAL PROBLEMS UNLESS YOU'RE THERE FACE TO FACE WITH SOMEONE THE PARISH PRIEST UNLESS BOSS SAYS I QUOTE HIS WORDS SIMPLE PEOPLE HERE HAVE SHOWN COMPASSION HUMANITY NEVER SEEN IN THESE PARTS BEFORE
SO WE MUST NOT CLOSE OUR HEARTS SO THAT'S THE KERNEL OF THE CHRISTIAN MESSAGE HOW IT'S TRANSLATED INTO A POLITICAL SOLUTION IS A JUDGEMENT THERE HAS MANY OTHER FACTORS IN THIS AS WELL BUT WE MUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD ON A SENSE OF HER MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT THESE ARE OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN NEED AND WE HAVE TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TOGETHER
TO HOPE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND CLEARLY AS YOU'VE ACKNOWLEDGED ITS GOVERNMENT IN THE END WHO HAVE TO ACT TO MAKE THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE TRANSFORMING DIFFERENCES AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING CLEARLY IS THAT THEY NEED TO SHOW MORE HUMANITY
I DO AND I THINK WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AS A VERY RICH COUNTRY THINK OF THE COUNTRY LIKE THE LEBANON AND SOME OF THE OTHER MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE A PROPORTION OF REFUGEES PRESENT WHICH REPRESENTS LIKE THIRTY FORTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION AND THEY COPE WE ARE A VERY RICH COUNTRY AND I THINK WITH A GREATER COHESIVENESS BETWEEN A SPIRIT OF WILLINGNESS THAT IS THERE AMONG MANY
AND MECHANISMS WHICH GOVERNMENTS CAN PUT INTO PLACE WE COULD BE DOING MORE BUT YOU WILL BE AWARE OBVIOUSLY HAD PEOPLE LISTENING TO YOU NO IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR HIM HE'S A CARDINAL I'M STRUGGLING I'VE GOT A FEW KIDS TO BRING UP AND I CAN BARELY MANAGE AT WHY SHOULD BE HELPING WE BE HELPING PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE JUST STAYED AT HOME
WELL I THINK THE POINT OF THAT SENTENCES CLEARLY MOST OF THEM CAN'T YOU STAY AT HOME OTHERWISE ANY GOOD THE WISE THEY WOULD
NO I DON'T THINK THE STRUGGLE OF PEOPLE IN THE DESTROYED VILLAGES IN AROUND IN AND AROUND MOSEL AND OTHER PARTS OF SYRIA SOME OF THEM WE LISTEN TO A FEW MINUTES AGO STRUGGLE SO I'M NOT THE SAME AS OUR STRUGGLE BUT THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE COMING HERE BECAUSE THEY WANTED PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLY THEY WANT A BETTER LIFE AND THEY'RE WILLING TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION
SO WE SHOULD BE MORE GENEROUS TOWARDS THOSE PEOPLE AS WELL NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES BY TERRIBLE WAR BUT BY THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT A BETTER LIFE WE SHOULD BE MORE DID TO THOSE PEOPLE WE SHOULD BE MORE GENEROUS AS WELL I THINK AS A SAY THERE ARE THINGS COMMENDABLE ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH AND TAKING REFUGEES DIRECTLY FROM THE REFUGEE CAMPS THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THAT BUT BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THAT HELPS US TO MONITOR AND TO RECEIVE WELL
THAT'S THE PROGRAMME I WOULD LIKE TO SEE EXTENDED CONSIDERABLY BY OUR GOVERNMENT AND WE ARE VERY GENEROUS TO PEOPLE IN THE REFUGEE CAMPS AROUND THE WORLD
BUT IT JUST NEEDS A MORE COHESIVE APPROACH AS THEY SAY WE NEED TO SEE WHAT IS THERE IN FRONT OF US THESE HELP PEOPLE HE SAID ENGINEERS WHO HAVE WORKED FOR BRITISH COMPANIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST THEY ARE PEOPLE LIKE OUR SELVES AND THEY ARE DESPERATE AND WE SHOULD OPEN OUR HEARTS AS WELL AS I.
POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES MAY I ASK YOU JUST A QUICK HASN'T FIGURED ON HER VERY LONG AND IT'S ABOUT THE ZEKE A VIRUS AS YOU WILL KNOW THAT THE SCENT OF A SIGHTING STUDIES HAS CONCLUDED THERE IS A DEFINITE THE PROVABLE LINK BETWEEN
ZUCKER AND SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WOMEN WHO BECOME PREGNANT WITH THE DISEASE IS IT NOT AT THE POINT NOW IT WHICH ARE WE NOT AT THE POINT WHERE THE ROOM COVERED SHOULD SAY YES WE WE WILL
CHANGE OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS CONTRACEPTION IN THESE EMERGENCIES
I THINK DOESN'T THAT IT'S QUITE A DELICATE QUESTION BECAUSE CHURCH TEACHING IS BASED ON SOMETHING THAT IS PROFOUND IN HUMAN NATURE AND THAT ARE KIND OF ENDURANCE AND THEREFORE THERE'S AN ENDURING QUALITY ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THAT SAYS THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN SEXUAL INTERCOURSE IN MARRIAGE AND PROCREATION
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHICH PEOPLE MAKE THEIR DECISIONS AND WE HAVE TO KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE TWO AND NOT BREAK
AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE DO NOT BREAK THE LINK BETWEEN THAT STRIVING TO UNDERSTAND ON NATURE AT ITS FULLEST AND AT ITS BEST AND WHAT WE DO IN ANY PARTICULAR CIRCLE IF THERE IS THE RISK OF GREAT SUFFERING BECAUSE CHILDREN WILL BE BORN WITH MICHAEL SURPLUS AND SUFFER HUGELY AS A RESULT
PEOPLE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE SITUATION IS AND HOW THEY RESPOND TO MEDICAL DATA AND TO THEIR OWN RELATIONSHIP THAT THERE WILL BE A VARIETY OF WAYS OF RESPONDING TO THIS AND I THINK WE SHOULD RESPECT THE SPACE IN WHICH PEOPLE MAKE THEIR DECISIONS KEEPING HER MIND ALL OF THESE FACTORS CARDINAL MICHAEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
