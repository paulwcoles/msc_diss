STUFF THANKS VERY MUCH EXCUSE ME IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX IT WASN'T THAT LONG BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR THAT THE PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON FINALLY LEFT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL BUILDING A SHORT DISTANCE FROM ME HERE IN BRUSSELS
HE'S BEEN IN MEETINGS WITH VARIOUS OTHER E.U. LEADERS FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT AND THERE'S MEETINGS WILL CONTINUE INTO MUCH OF TODAY AND THAT'S BECAUSE DESPITE ALL THE WARM WORDS WHEN THEY ARRIVED HERE YESTERDAY ABOUT A DEAL BEING DONE WHEN ALL TWENTY EIGHT LEADERS SAT DOWN TOGETHER THEY DISCOVERED THERE WAS STILL SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS ON THE SAME ISSUES THAT HAVE CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR WEEKS
AT ABOUT HALF PAST TWO THIS MORNING HERE IN BRUSSELS THE MEETING OF ALL TWENTY EIGHT LEADERS ENDED AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL DONALD TO US CALLED A PRESS CONFERENCE AND SAID THE WORK WAS FAR FROM OVER
FOR MO I CAN WELL IF THEY HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS BUT IT'S THA REMAINS TO BE DONE
AWAY WERE HAULED A FURIOUS BAILOUT THE ONLY THING SO I THINK WITH PRIME MINISTER CAMERON PRESIDENT ALONE PRIME MINISTER FOR BOTH AND IF THE SHOW OBVIOUSLY RURAL DO IT TOGETHER WAS UNPLUGGED THE COMMISSIONERS FOLKY CLEANED IF IN THIS PROCESS I THINK
I WAS SURE THE GOODS BELONG TO THAT IT'S WELL IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG NIGHT FOR EVERYONE AT THESE TALKS PARTICULARLY DAVID CAMERON WHO DIDN'T LEAVE THE BUILDING UNTIL WELL AFTER FOUR THIS MORNING THERE IS STILL A DETERMINATION TO FIND A DEAL THE DUTCH PRIME MINISTER MARGARET IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S BETTER FRIENDS IN EUROPE AND AFTER THE COUNCIL MEETING BROKE UP HE SAID BRITAIN AND EUROPE WOULD BOTH BE WORSE OFF IF THEY PARTED COMPANY
WE NEED EACH OTHER WE WANT HIM TO STAY FOR A LITTLE AS WE ARE AS A COUNTRY ARE VERY MUCH OUTWARD LOOKING FOR YOU MARK
SO IT'S VITAL TO HAVE IN THEIR EUROPEAN UNION IT COLIC A BIG CROP YOUR KINGDOM ONE OF THE BIGGEST ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD TO BE PART OF THAT AND WILL SHARE THAT MARKET ORIENTATION SHOW IT WILL BE
USEFUL BUT ALSO FOR YOUR K. MY BELIEVE INSTEAD YOU'RE K. OUTSIDE YOU'LL BE UNION HOARD AND ARE BEING A MID SIZE ECONOMY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IS
SO I GUESS FOR BOTH OF US WITH THIS CRUCIAL THAT BRITISH STREET TO GET THE DUTCH PRIME MINISTER MARK RUTTER WERE LATE LAST NIGHT IN THE VAST AIRCRAFT HANGAR OF A PRESS ROOM HERE I SPOKE TO GEOFF MADE IS THE FORMER EUROPE EDITOR OF THE PRESS ASSOCIATION AND HE'S BEEN DOING THE SUMMIT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE HE TOLD ME THIS WAS THE BIGGEST THAT HE'D COVERED IN YEARS AND HE SAID WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT IT WAS THAT ALL TWENTY EIGHT LEADERS KNOW THAT WHATEVER DEAL THEY COME UP WITH HAS TO WIN OVER THE BRITISH PEOPLE
HOWEVER LONG WE MAY HAVE TO STAY AWAKE TO GET A FINAL DIOR HOWEVER LONG THEY BARTER AND NEGOTIATE WE ALWAYS EXPECT AND WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT WHEN THEY FINISH THAT'S IT WHETHER IT'S A GOOD DEAL OR A BAD DEAL THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY EXPERIENCE IN BRUSSELS WHERE WHATEVER HAPPENS HERE GOOD BAD OR INDIFFERENT SHOCKING OR NOT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY BECAUSE THEN HORROR OF HORRORS THE WHOLE DEAL GOES TO THE WAITING BRITISH PUBLIC TO VOTE ON AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE SERIOUS THEATRE
JEFF MADE THEIR FORMER EDITOR OF THE PRESS ASSOCIATION WELL AT ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS THEY OF COURSE WERE PRINTED LONG BEFORE THESE MEETINGS BROKE UP IT'S SO IT WAS REALLY VERY RECENTLY BUT THEY HAVE PICKED UP ON A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE EMERGING FROM THE MEETING'S NOT LEAST IN THE DAILY MAIL'S WORDS FACE THAT SAYS IT ALL HE'S THEIR HEADLINE OVER A PICTURE OF HER
FROWNING DAVID CAMERON AND THAT WAS SUCH A PICTURE TAKEN AS TALKS GOT UNDERWAY BUT THEIR LINE IS THAT IT'S A SHAMBLES AS THE EMBATTLED PRIME MINISTER'S DEAL IS WATERED DOWN AND EURO M.P.S ARE THREATENING TO KILL IT OFF THE PAPER SUGGESTS HE WAS AMBUSHED HERE LAST NIGHT WITH DEMANDS TO WATER DOWN THE DEAL WITH EASTERN EUROPEAN LEADERS WARNING THAT HE BRITAIN MUST TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT
AND HIM PLEADING IN THE WORDS OF THE MALE FOR A CREDIBLE PACKAGE TO HELP HIM NOT BRITAIN INTO THE E.U. FOR A GENERATION THERE'S ALSO A IMAGINE THE FRENCH AND THE BELGIANS ARE INSISTING THAT THERE COULDN'T BE A SECOND RENT REFERENDUM IF THE U.K. VOTES TO LEAVE AND IT'S SOMETHING PICKED UP THEIR TIME TO THE GOD IN THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE THE IDEA THAT YES SETTLE A DEAL NOW BUT THAT'S IT THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER POSSIBILITY FOR BRITAIN TO REOPEN TALKS NOT ALL THE PAPERS LEAD WITH EUROPE THE MIRROR
DOES HAS IT FRONT PAGE LEAD BASED ON THAT TERM SUPREME COURT RULING YESTERDAY ABOUT JOINT ENTERPRISE GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER IS ITS HEADLINE AND HE QUOTES A MOTHER AT THE MOTHER OF THE MURDERED TEENAGER BECKY WHAT'S THIS MAKES JUSTICE A JOKE THE TIMES LEAD IS ABOUT A FRONT PAGE STORIES ABOUT POLICE SPENDING A YEAR TRAWLING THROUGH THE PRIVATE PAPERS OF EDWARD HEATH
AS PART OF ENQUIRY INTO ALLEGED SEX ABOUT ABUSE EXPECTED TO COST MILLIONS WILTSHIRE POLICE HIS RECORDINGS ARE BILLIONS IN INVESTIGATORS TO EXAMINE THE HEATH ARCHIVE AT THE BODLEIAN LIBRARY AND HAS A STORY ABOUT CROISSANTS IS THIS THE ENDED ASKS OF CURVY CROISSANTS TESCO IS SAYING AU REVOIR TO TRADITIONAL COULD CROISSANTS
ONLY PRODUCE STRAIGHT ONES FROM TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE PASTRY'S NAME ITSELF MEANS CRESCENT IN FRENCH STREET BUT I WAS NEXT ANYBODY THE TIME IS NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD HIS FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE VOTERS IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE A PRIMARY ON SATURDAY A DAY AFTER THE POPE SHOCKED A LOT OF PEOPLE BY SAYING TRUMP WAS NOT TO KRISTIAN A CORRESPONDENT LAURA BECCA TOLD ME HE WASN'T EXACTLY FAZED BY IT
HE FELT AS IF HE WAS ON A CHAT SHOW AT TIMES HE DID NOT LOOK AT ANY WAY FLAPPER BALL HE JUST WAS VERY MATTER OF FACT IS THIS GOING TO DO HIM ANY HARM IN SOUTH CAROLINA I MEAN WE'RE LOOKING AT PHOTOS GOING TO THEIR PAWS IN JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS
PERHAPS NOT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS BAD PUBLICITY THEY SAY WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS DATE YOU'VE GOT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF SOUTH CAROLINA'S A EVANGELICALS SO PERHAPS WHAT THE POPE SAYS HE'S NOT IN TICKING FRONT AND CENTRE STAGE
AND THIS IS THE AGENDA THAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT TRUMP'S AGENDA IS BACK ON THE TABLE THEY'RE BACK TALKING ABOUT HIS BALL AND THAT'S THE THING ISN'T IT WITH MISTER TRUMP ALMOST ANYTHING HE HAS SEEN US IN THE END TO WIN HIM MORE SUPPORT HOWEVER CONTROVERSIAL IT HAPPENS TO BE JOHN JOURNALISTS COVERING THIS INUNDATED STATES
EACH DAY BRINGS A NEW SURPRISE WE JUST DO NOT KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT AND FOR THE LAST TWELVE HOURS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP VERSES THE PORK I THINK WATCH I'VE WATCHED A LOT OF THESE TEN HOLES AND IT'S A KIND OF QUESTION AND ANSWER AND FORMAT
AND AFTER EACH OF THE CANDIDATES THEY GET UP THEY WALK AROUND THEY LOOK LOOK AT THE CAMERA TONIGHT HE JUST STAYED ANY SEAT HE CHATTED ABOUT HIS LIFE HIS FAMILY AND HIS WHOLE ETHOS IN BUSINESS AND HE WAS COMPELLING HE WAS I THINK TAKEN YOU CAN SEE THE AUDIENCE FALLING A LONG WITH HIM SO WE'RE GOING TO SERVE IT
WHO'S THE DONALD TRUMP WELL WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS WEEKEND I MEAN WHEN IT COMES TO DONALD TRUMP AND SOUTH CAROLINA HE'S BEEN AHEAD IN THE PAUL SINCE LAST I
COULD THIS WEEKEND HEADERS BUT SURPRISES WELL LISTEN AND BE PREPARED FOR EVERY SINGLE SURPRISE AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT CERTAINLY ALL EYES ON SOUTH CAROLINA WHO KNOWS INDEED LAURA THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TIME NOW QUARTER PAST SIX WELL HE UNCERTAINTY OVER NEGOTIATIONS HERE IN BRUSSELS IS YET ANOTHER ISSUE FOR THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TO THINK ABOUT AT TINY BECKETT AS A BUSINESS NEWS THIS MORNING GOOD MORNING TANYA HI THERE SARAH WELL ADD THE BRECHT'S HE QUESTIONED SOME MORE DISAPPOINTING ECONOMIC NEWS FROM CHINA ON THE SUBJECT OF INFLATION THIS TIME COMMODITY STOCKS OBVIOUSLY PRETTY VOLATILE THE MARKET'S SPENT A DAY ONCE AGAIN
IN THE RED ON THURSDAY AND ASIA OF COURSE IS PICKING UP ON THAT MAIN STEPHEN BELL IS CHIEF ECONOMIST AT B. O. GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT DAVID PAID ALSO WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO IS SENIOR ECONOMIST AT AXA INVESTMENT MANAGERS SO THE BRECK SICK QUESTION IS STILL VERY MUCH IN THE BALANCE STEPHEN AND IT'S HAVING ITS EFFECT ON STERLING ABSOLUTELY SEVERAL BANKS HAVE GONE VERY NEGATIVE ON STERLING
PARTLY BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE ANYWAY BUT THEY'VE SAID BREAKS IT IS A FACT THAT WE CAN SEE IT PRICED IN YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRADE VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE VOLATILITY AROUND THAT REFERENDUM DAY IS VERY HIGH SO
IF THE REFERENDUM AS TAKES PLACE IN JUNE AS WE EXPECT AND THE OPINION POLL SWING AGAINST STAYING IN THEN YOU CAN SEE STERLING FALLING AND VICE VERSA EXACTLY I THINK SELLING IS GOING TO GO UP BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO VOTE REMAIN BUT THAT'S A FORECAST YEP DAVID DO YOU THINK THE ER THE THE FALL IN STIRLING AT THE MOMENT IS BASED AROUND THE UNCERTAINTY OR THE PROSPECT OF A BRECHT SET
I THINK IT IS THE UNCERTAINTY IT'S OBVIOUSLY FORWARD PRICING WAS THAT YOU CAN SEE BRECHT'S AFFECTING EVERY FINANCIAL MARKET THE INTEREST RATE MARKETS ARE SUGGESTING WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE A RATE RISE NOW COMING THROUGH UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THEIR FACTORY IN THE POSSIBILITY OF BRECHT'S IT COMING THROUGH THERE AS WELL SO WE ARE SEEING IMPACT LOW THINGS OF COURSE IS THE POLLS AS YOU SAY START TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND WE CAN EXPECT MORE VOLATILITY OF THE NEXT TOUGH MONTHS BEFORE HOPEFULLY WE GET
THE RESOLUTION THAT STEPHEN'S TALK IT'S ADAM TO A HEADY MIX OF COURSE THE O.E.C.D. IS SUGGESTING THAT IT'S TAPERING BACK ITS EXPECTATIONS FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES THERE IS A SUGGESTION THAT MORE STIMULATORY MEASURES MIGHT EMERGE FROM THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW
WHAT IT MIGHT YET HAVE IN THE TOOLBOX IF INTEREST RATES ALREADY NEGATIVE YOU'VE ALWAYS SEEN DRAGGY FLAG THAT WE THINK THE INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO MOVE MORE NEGATIVE PUSH WE THINK THEY COULD TAKE THEM TO MINUS A HALF BUT THEY MIGHT NOT GO THAT HALLWAY IN MARCH AND IT'S GOING TO BE A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL MOVES AS WELL THAT COMES THROUGH I THINK IN MARCH AS WELL BUT MORE EASING TO COME FROM FROM THE CBBC PROBABLY FROM THE BANK POSSIBLY FROM CHINA AIN'T WELL YOU MENTION CHINA STEPHEN IT'S BEEN THE INFLATION RATE LOW INFLATION RATE FROM CHINA THAT'S BEEN WORRYING THE MARKETS THIS WEEK
THAT'S RIGHT WELL PEOPLE SEE CHINA IT'S WEIRD I CAN REMEMBER THE DAY
HIGH INFLATION WAS A BAD THING YES IT'S THE LOW INFLATION'S ABOUT THING AND IT'S EXPORTED FROM CHINA BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT TOO MUCH CAPACITY STEEL BEING A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE WHICH
THEY CUT THEIR PRICES AND DUMPING ON EUROPE AND THAT'S A BIG DEBATE ABOUT OPPOSITION WITHIN EUROPE FOR EXAMPLE SO IT'S
WITH INFLATION LOW ANYWAY WHEN YOU GET A BIT OF A KNOCK THE THEORIES IT TIPS OVER INTO DEFLATION ACTUALLY IN THIS COUNTRY UNEMPLOYMENT'S VERY LOW AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET A PICK UP IN WAGE INFLATION SOME PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS CAN'T REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN THEY GOT A PAY RISE LAST BUT I THINK WITH A LIVING WAGE COMING IN AND APRIL I THINK WE WILL GET
DOMESTICALLY GENERATED INFLATION THE GLOBAL INFLATIONARY BACKGROUND COULD HARDLY BE MORE BENIGN IN TERMS OF CORPORATE NEWS AND INVEST A NEWS REALLY WE'RE SEEING SOME COMPANIES NOW SAYING WE'RE NOT HANDING OUT A DIFFIDENT AND THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT IN THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT UNDERSEA MAKE WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RETURNS ON MARKETS AND SO FORTH
INTEREST RATES ARE SO LOW THAT DIVIDEND YIELD ON THE U.K. STOCK MARKET IS FANTASTIC WELL PROVIDING THEY DON'T CUT THE DIVIDEND AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A MARKET BUT SUGGESTIVE EVENTS WILL BE VERY WEAK
BUT THEY'LL STILL PROVIDE A DECENT RETURN AND ACTUALLY FOUR PER CENT AS A DIVIDEND YOU THAT'S
EXTREMELY GOOD COMPARED TO WHAT YOU CAN GET IN THE BANK OR BY LENDING TO THE GOVERNMENT SO IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT A VERY ATTRACTIVE MARKET THEM AS LEAVE IT STEPHEN THEY'LL DAVID PAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WELL IF YOU TRY TO GET ACCESS TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IN THE MOMENT ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN IT
YOU MOST LIKELY USE A PASSWORD OR A CODE OR YOU MIGHT BE A SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT'S IS ALL CHANGING TODAY H.S.B.C. AS ANNOUNCING THE ROLL OUT OF BIOMETRIC SECURITY TECHNOLOGY IN THE U.K. WHICH HIS VOICE OR FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION TO YOU AND ME HERE TO EXPLAIN IT ALL IS JOE GORDON FROM H.S.B.C. HE IS THE U.K. HEAD OF CUSTOMER CONTACT JOE SO LET'S START WITH IF YOU PHONE UP H.S.B.C. AND YOUR OWN H.S.B.C. CUSTOMER HOW MIGHT IT WORK
SO THIS IS ALL ABOUT OFFERING SOLUTIONS TO REAL PROBLEMS SO FOR US IN THE VOICE WHAT WE ATTEMPT TO DO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO BUY THIS SUMMER HIS VOICE BIOMETRICS TO CAPTURE YOUR VOICE PRINT WHICH IS UNIQUE TO YOU
ACTUALLY IS AS UNIQUE AS YOUR FINGERPRINT TO IDENTIFY YOU AND VERIFY YOU WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE MUCH MALIGNED PASSWORD SAGA OR SECURITY I.D. NUMBERS THAT WE'RE MORE THAN FAMILIAR O.K. SO I PICK UP THE PHONE TO H.S.B.C. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT SO YOU PICK UP THE PHONE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FIRST IS WILL ENROL YOU AND WE'LL DO THAT BY CAPTURING UNIQUE VOICE PRINT WHICH COVERS OVER ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS BIT BOTH PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL AND THEN THE NEXT TIME YOU RING UP
WE'LL USE THAT EXACT SAME VOICE PRINT TO VERIFY THAT YOU ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE DELIVERING A REALLY SWIFT AND SIMPLE GREAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IF YOU GOING ONLINE SOME PHONES AND THINKING OF THE I PHONE IN PARTICULAR RECOGNISES ANYWAY YOUR FINGERPRINT SO THAT MIGHT BE THE BIOMETRIC ENTRY POINT FOR ONLINE BANK YES ACROSS BOTH FIRST DIRECT ROLLING UP BIOMETRICS BOTH USING WHAT WE CALL TOUCH I.D. WHICH IS AGAIN LIKE YOU SAID USING YOUR UNIQUE FINGERPRINT ON AN APPLE DEVICE TO LOGIN
AND THEN VOICE I.D. ON TELEPHONY CHANNEL RIGHT BUT YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST BANKS DOA BARCLAYS WEALTH HAS ACTUALLY DONE IT BUT IT RAISES THE QUESTION GIVEN THAT THEY DIDN'T OFFER IT TO ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS IS THAT EXPENSIVE TO DO SO WE ARE DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S A GREAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE SO FOR US IT'S ABOUT ACTUALLY HOW DO WE BRING THIS TO EVERYONE AND HOW DO WE OFFER THIS OPPORTUNITY OF BIOMETRICS AND THAT SIMPLIFIED JOURNEY FOR HAVE YOU GOT THERE
I THINK SO YES WE'RE ROLLING OUT TOUCH I.D. AT THE MOMENT BUT HE'S ALREADY AVAILABLE YES AND OVER THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS IN FIRST DIRECT AND THEN LATER IN HEDGES P.C. FOR VOICE RIGHT FRAUDSTERS HAVE NOT REALLY FOCUSED I WOULD IMAGINE ON THIS A GREAT DEAL IN THE PAST SIMPLY BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY PREVALENT BUT THEY MIGHT NOW HOW DIFFICULT IS IT FOR FRAUDSTERS TO GET ROUND THIS SO WE KNOW THIS IS MORE RESILIENT TO ATTACKS THIS IS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO FRAUD AND IT'S ACTUALLY DELIVERS A GOOD CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE SO LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT'S THAT UNIQUE ABILITY
TO BE ABLE TO BE BOTH PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL OVER VOICE THAT WE CAN CAPTURE AND WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU'VE GOT A COLD OF YOUR VOICES AND SOME WAYNE PAD SO THAT'S THE GREAT THING SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO COPE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOT COLDS OR SLIGHT IMPEDIMENT WE CAN PICK UP PICK THAT UP THINGS SUCH AS THE SIZE OF YOUR MOUTH OR YOUR VOCAL TRACT DON'T CHANGE NEITHER YOUR CADENCE OR YOUR ACCENT WHEN YOU'VE GOT THAT LITTLE COLT
JOE GORDON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WELL IT WAS FOUNDED FORTY YEARS AGO THE BODY SHOP IS ABOUT AS ETHICAL AS A BEAUTY BUSINESS
AS YOU COULD GET ITS FOUNDER THE LATE ANITA RODDICK TRACK TO THE RAINFOREST TO CAMPAIGN FOR THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND SOURCE LOCAL BEAUTY SECRETS THEN SHE SURPRISED EVERYONE BY SELLING UP TO COSMETICS GIANT GLORIA AND THE MAN NOW AT THE HELM IS TRYING TO REVIVE THAT SPIRIT JEMMY SHORTS IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE BODY SHOP IS WITH US HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING
THAT WHAT ANITA RODDICK DID AT THE TIME SHE WAS DOING IT WAS VERY PROGRESSIVE INDEED SHE WAS QUITE WILD WASN'T SHE AND SHE HAD A HUGE PERSONALITY AND SHE TALK MUCH MORE ABOUT COMMUNITIES IN THE SUSTAINABILITY ALMOST THAN SHE DID ABOUT MAKING PROFITS IT'S A DIFFICULT ACT TO FOLLOW ISN'T IT WELL I'M NOT TRYING TO FOLLOW THAT ACT I AM DOING MY OWN THING AND THE BODY SHOP IS LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE BECAUSE THE FUTURE
HE'S GOING TO BE VERY MORE CHALLENGING THAN IN THE PAST AND TODAY WE'RE LAUNCHING A COMMITMENT WHICH IS A STATEMENT THAT IS BOTH ORIGINAL AND PIONEERING AND IT IS TO BE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE AND ETHICAL UGLY BUT EVERYBODY'S IN ON THAT ACT RIGHT NOW SO WHAT IS IT SPECIFICALLY THE OR DOING THAT IS PROGRESSIVE AND DIFFERENT WELL EVERYBODY ELSE WHO IS WE'RE VERY FLATTERED COPIED THE BODY SHOP'S FOCUS ON SUSTAINABILITY OVER FORTY YEARS AGO REALLY FOCUSES ON CUTTING
CUTTING EMISSIONS FOR EXAMPLE AND WE'VE LOOKED AT IT DIFFERENTLY LOOKED AT HOW CAN THE PLANET FLOURISH YET HAVE US OPERATE COMMERCIALLY AND WE'VE LAUNCHED A CONCEPT CALLED IN RICH NOT EXPLOIT HOW CAN WE RICH PEOPLE ARE NOT EXPLOIT THEM IN RICH PRODUCTS AND THE PLANETS ARE NOT EXPLOIT THEM IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH IS THERE A DIFFICULT BALANCE BETWEEN THESE GOALS AND MAKING PROFITS WHICH ULTIMATELY MUST DO
NOT IF YOU TAKE THIS APPROACHING TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE I WENT INTO THE AMAZON OR DEEP INTO THE AMAZON LAST FEBRUARY TO SEE WITH MY OWN EYES HOW COULD WE ACHIEVED THIS AND IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE THE MOST PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY TRADE ESTABLISHMENT AND IF YOU WORK WITH COMMUNITIES YOU CAN BOTH GROW AN INGREDIENT BUT ALSO RESPECT THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE PLANET SO THE KEY IS GOING BACK TO THE SAUCE
ABSOLUTELY IN EVERY INDUSTRY IT HAS TO START WITH A SORTING HIS WHAT DO YOU DO TO THE PLANET WHEN YOU SAW SUCH INGREDIENT AND YOU EITHER DESTROY IT OR AS THEY ARE APPROACHED YOU ACTUALLY WORKS SUSTAINABLY WITH IT IF NOT IMPROVE IT IMPACT
THE KEY IS ALSO COMMUNICATING THIS TO THE CONSUMER AND ITS IMPORTANCE AND KEEPING THEM ENGAGED OF COURSE IS YOU DON'T HAVE ANITA RODDICK'S WILD HARE IN FACT YOU LOOK VERY WELL GROOMED TO ME BUT YOU ARE A MARKETING MAN SO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO THIS HOW DOES IT HOW IS THIS COMMUNICATED IN ON THE HIGH STREET AND IN YOUR SHOPS WORLD WE ARE BRINGING IT OUT IN THIS STATEMENT BUT LET ME GIVE YOU A CONCRETE EXAMPLE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AND I'M NOW MANUFACTURING PLASTIC THAT WILL BE ON SOME OF OUR PACKAGING FROM AIR
RIGHT AND YOU HAVE BUT HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE CUSTOMER SUCH THAT THEY CONTINUE TO BUY IN TO WHAT THE PRODUCT REPRESENTS SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF EXPLAINING THAT THIS PACKAGING FOR EXAMPLE CALLED CARBON IS AN INNOVATION IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE CAN MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS AND THAT CONSUMERS CAN BOTH DO GOOD AND HOW PRODUCTS ARE BENEFIT THEM ALL RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE HIGH STREET YOU ARE IN SIXTY FIVE COUNTRY IS THE HIGH STREET IN THE U.K. OF COURSE IS CHANGING RAPIDLY HOW DO YOU KEEP
BRITISH CUSTOMERS COMING THROUGH THE DOORS AS YOU SAY WERE IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND AS I GO TO INDONESIA OR BRAZIL OR AMERICA CAREER THE HIGH STREET IS ACTUALLY VIBRANT WORLDWIDE THE SECRET IS TO BE FIRST OF ALL ON THE GOOD STREETS AND WORLDWIDE THERE ARE STREETS THAT ARE VIBRANT AND OTHERS HAD AUNT AND THE NEXT THING IS TO BRING EXPERIENCES TO CUSTOMERS THEY DO WANT TO GO TO THE HIGH STREET THEY DO WANT TO GO INTO SHOPS THEY WANT TO HAVE GREAT SERVICE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO STAY AT THE LEADING EDGE AND BRING NEW SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE
CONSULTATION OR WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN EXPERIENCE THE SKINCARE AND BODY PRODUCTS PERSONALLY THEMSELVES AND WHEN YOU DO THIS I ASSURE YOU THEY COME TO THE STORES AND SO THAT RULE APPLIES WHETHER YOU'RE OPERATING IN TAIWAN OR LONDON ABSOLUTELY IT DOES IT'S IT'S REALLY A GLOBAL VIBRANCY OF THE ONE TREND THAT I DO SEE WHICH IS INTERESTING IS WHAT I'M CALLING THE PREMIUM ISATION OF HIGH STREETS LANDLORDS ARE LOOKING FOR FOR BRANDS BRING SOMETHING EXTRA
JUST BRIEFLY THERE IS IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT ONE COME COMPANY WHICH HAS VERY STRONG ETHICAL VALUES HAS TAKEN OVER BY ANOTHER WHICH MAY NOT COMPLETELY SHARE THEM LORI OUR HAS BEEN IN THE PRESS QUOTED A GREAT DEAL FOR ANIMAL TESTING OF COURSE MANY COSMETICS COMPANIES WERE BUT THE FACT IS THAT IF YOU OPERATE IN CHINA THAT IS THE LAW FIRST OF ALL L'OREAL DOES NOT TEST ON ANIMALS
AND I HAVE TO REINFORCE THAT STATEMENT BECAUSE IT IS MISUNDERSTOOD THE SECOND THING THE MOST IMPORTANT IS ACTUALLY LAUREN HAS COMPLETELY EMBRACED THE VALUES OF THE BODY SHOP IN FACT WHEN THEY BOUGHT IT THEY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT COMMUNITY TRADE IT WAS AGAINST ANIMAL TESTING IT WAS ABOUT DOING GOOD IN THE WORLD AND L'OREAL FOR EXAMPLE USES A SESAME SEED SUPPLY IN THE BIGGEST LIPSTICK IN THE WORLD COLOURATION THERE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE BODY SHOP INFLUENCING A BECOMING LIKE L'OREAL JEREMY SHORTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

HE SAID NOTHING AS A JOURNALIST THERE SAID WELL BEN RYDER'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT BEN CAN WE ADD ANYTHING DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT I SUPPOSE WHY WOULD SAY NOTHING HOW BAD ARE THINGS IT'S ALIVE NEGOTIATION DIDN'T WANT TO REVEAL HIS HAND AROUND THE SAME SORT OF TIME NUMBER TEN SOURCES SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME PROGRESS BUT THERE WAS STILL PLENTY TO DO THERE IS A VIEW THAT THIS IS ALL PART OF AN ELABORATE THEATRE ALLOWING DAVID CAMERON AND OTHER COUNTRIES TOO
REVEL IN THE DRAMA OF IT PLAYING TO A HOME AUDIENCE THEN AT THE END OF ALL OF THIS THERE WILL BE AN AGREEMENT THAT'S WHAT THE LITHUANIAN PRESIDENT SAID IF IT IS A THEATRE IS ALL IT'S A PRETTY MASOCHISTIC PRODUCTION BECAUSE THAT WAS A GRUELLING NIGHT OF TALKS DAVID CAMERON HAD BILATERAL MEETINGS WITH DONALD TUSK WITH PRESIDENT A LONG AREN'T UNDERNEATH THAT OFFICIAL
HEAD OF GOVERNMENT LEVEL THERE WAS INTENSIVE TALKS GOING ON BETWEEN THE CALLED SHERPAS DIPLOMATS LAWYERS TRYING TO HAMMER OUT A NEW DRAFT TEXAN EVERYBODY CAN SIGN UP TO LATER IN THE MORNING AND WE EXPECT THAT DRAUGHT THAT NEW DRAFT BE PRESENTED AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK BRUSSELS TIME THIS MORNING O.K. SO THERE ARE THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THERE WILL BE A DEAL AND POSSIBLY THIS MORNING THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT GETTING EVERY E. LEADER TO SIGN UP TO A NEW
DRAFT AND THEN THE DEAL WOULD BE SIDE BUT THEY'RE ALL SAY THEY'RE REALLY PUTTING HIM THROUGH THE WRINGER ON THIS I MEAN MAYBE IT IS THE CHOREOGRAPHER IT IS EXTRAORDINARY I'M IN THE MAKING AND PAID FOR FOR HAVING THIS NEGOTIATION YES AND IT IS ALSO I THINK WE MAY CLEAR TO HIM BY DONALD TO US BY ALL JUNK AT THAT THIS REALLY IS THE SUMMIT TO DO THIS DEAL
BUT THAT'S BEEN MADE QUITE CLEAR EUROPE ONCE THE E. WANTS TO MOVE ON THEY WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS QUESTION NOW DAVID CAMERON BREEZED IN HERE OF COURSE WITH HIS TALK OF BATTLES ASKING THEM TO DEAL WITH THIS QUESTION WITH HAVE FESTERED FOR SO MANY YEARS BUT IF HE THOUGHT THAT WAS SIMPLY GOING TO GET THEM TO SIGN UP IMMEDIATELY HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFICULT STUBBORN CONTENTIOUS QUESTIONS AT THE HEART OF THE AGREEMENT THAT HE'S ASKING FOR
THE MANY COUNTRIES FIND PROBLEMATIC AND THAT THEY'RE FORCING HIM TO WATER DOWN I MEAN IS THE WILL THE DEAL WE END UP WITH IT WAS AS YOU WERE DAMNED IF YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE STARTED WITH HE'S TALKED ALL THE WAY ALONG ABOUT NEEDING A DEAL THAT IS CREDIBLE BUT HE CAN SELL WITH CONFIDENCE TO VOTERS IN THE COURSE OF A REFERENDUM THAT COULD OF COURSE BE ANNOUNCED TONIGHT IN DOWNING STREET IF YOU GET THE DEAL HE WANTS BUT THERE IS DETAIL THAT WE STILL NEED TO KNOW FOR INSTANCE EXACTLY HOW LONG
THIS FOUR YEAR CAP TO THE TAX CREDITS THAT HE WORK IN THE U.K. CAN GET HOW LONG THAT POLICY CAN BE USED BY THE U.K. GOVERNMENT FOR THERE'S A BIG QUESTION MARK AROUND THE IDEA OF PEGGING CHILD BENEFIT TO THE COST OF DOES TO THE COST OF LIVING IN A IN AN E.U. COUNTRY WHERE A CHILD LIVES
THAT POLAND IN PARTICULAR HAS A REAL BIG ISSUE WITH THIS IS IT GOING TO APPLY ONLY TO NEW ARRIVALS IN THE U.K. ALL OF THEIR PLIGHT IT EVERYBODY DOWNING STREET VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE IDEA OWED ONLY APPLY TO NEW ARRIVALS HOW EXACTLY ARE THESE NEW GUARANTEES THAT BRITAIN IS ASKING FOR ON NON EUROZONE PROTECTORS HOW'S THAT GOING TO WORK IS IT GOING TO BE EMBEDDED IN FUTURE TREATED THERE IS DETAIL THAT WE NEED TO KNOW LATER TODAY VERY SIGNIFICANT DETAIL BEN RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH
TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT MORE THAN BRITAIN IN BRUSSELS THERE'S A FAR GREATER CRISIS MASS MIGRATION IT'S BEEN AGREED THAT THE EEL TURKEY WILL MEET NEXT MONTH'S TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO STOP IT YOU'LL LEARN NELL IS OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT WHO WAS IN ANKARA AT THE MOMENT AND PRESUMABLY IT'S GOING TO BE THE EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES BEGGING TURKEY TO HOLD ON TO THE MIGRANTS AND NOT LET THEM GO
WELL THAT IS VERY MUCH THE CASE THE EUROPEAN LEADERS TRYING TO END THEIR FRAGMENTED APPROACH OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS AND THEY'RE PINNING ALL THEIR HOPES ON TURKEY FOR HOPE REALLY BEFORE THE SUMMIT THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL SAID THAT SHE WAS READY TO PUT ALL HER ENERGY INTO IMPLEMENTING THIS Y. YOU TURKEY PLAN IT FOCUSES
ON TAKING QUOTAS OF MIGRANTS BUT INSTEAD GOES BACK TO THAT THE ROOT CAUSE REDUCING THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS TO EUROPE AND REALLY LOOKING AT THIS ENTRY POINT VIA GREASE BECAUSE MOST OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED IN GREECE LAST YEAR
CAME THROUGH TURKEY SO THEY WENT TO TURKEY TO TIGHTEN ITS BORDER CONTROLS THIS PLAN THE DETAILS OF IT TALK ABOUT CHANGES TURKISH MAKE TO THE COASTGUARD TO INCH INCREASE INTERCEPTION TO DEAL WITH SMUGGLING ISSUES BUT ALSO THAT YOU USE OFFERING THREE BILLION EUROS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS
THE MORE THAN TWO MILLION SYRIAN REFUGEES WHO ARE HERE IN TURKEY THEY SAY SAY WILL BE GIVEN IN A FLEXIBLE WAY SO THAT THE REFUGEES HERE IN TURKEY GETS EDUCATION HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORK POSSIBILITIES OR THEIR MOTIVATIONS TO STAY IN TURKEY BUT THEY ARE ALREADY THEY ARE ALREADY DOING THAT AREN'T THEY OR ALL THOSE THINGS YOU'VE JUST TALKED BUT TURKEY IS DOING A GREAT DEAL OF THAT ALREADY
THAT'S RIDES AS THEIR HOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE REGION SO THEY REALLY ARE PROMISING TO BEEF IT UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
PUTTING A BIT OF PRESSURE ON TURKEY TO TIGHTEN THESE BORDER CONTROLS AND WHAT THEY'RE PROMISING THE TURKS AND RETURN IT IS TO EASE THESE ARE RULES FOR THEM
AND FAST ACH THAT E.U. MEMBERSHIP PROCESS THAT HAS ALSO BEEN PUT BACK ON THE AGENDA AS A RESULT OF ALL THESE PLANS I SHOULD SAY THE TURBOTS HAVEN'T AGREED TO THE DATE THEY'RE PROPOSING DAYS IN EARLY MARCH TO HAVE THE SUMMIT BUT OF COURSE BY THEN IT'LL BE THAT MUCH MORE URGENT THE WEATHER WILL BE WARMER THE SEAS WILL BE CALMER AND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE FLOWS OF PEOPLE INTO EUROPE WILL INCREASE AS A RESULT YOUR LAND MANY THANKS
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE FRONT PAGES OF THE MORNING PAPERS ONCE AGAIN DEVOTE MUCH SPACE TO THE SUBJECT OF EUROPE ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THE MEETINGS WENT ON HOURS AFTER THEY WENT TO PRESS A STRIKING IMAGE OF DAVID CAMERON THERE WITH FURROWED BROW AND PURSED LIPS DOMINATES THE FRONT OF THE MAIL UNDER THE HEADLINE FACE THAT SAYS IT ALL THE PAPER DESCRIBED HIM AS RATTLED BECAUSE HIS EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS

BELIEVE THEY WILL SECURE THE SUPPORT OF MORE THAN EIGHTY FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED FIRMS AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM THEY PERSIST SCORES ARE BUSINESSES ARE UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE AGREED TO BACK THE IN CAMPAIGN REGARDLESS OF THE DEAL FINALISED BY MISTER CAMERON THE GUARDIAN WAS THAT MUST COME AS EMBARKED ON THE BIGGEST GAMBLE OF HIS PREMIERSHIP TO NUMBER TEN SOURCE AS SAYING THE GOING AT THE TALKS IN BRUSSELS HAS BEEN TOUGH
A CONTINUING STAND OFF BETWEEN APPLE IN THE F.B.I.

AND CREATE A BACK DOOR INTO ITS OWN SECURITY SYSTEM EVERY ORGANISED CRIMINAL GANG
IN THE WORLD WOULD TRY TO GET THEIR HANDS ON IT IMAGINE THE BACKLASH HE WRITES IF ONE OF THEM SUCCEEDED SHE SAYS THE CASE SHOULD SERVE AS A TIMELY REMINDER TO THOSE OF US WHO INCREASING RELY ON OUR SMARTPHONES FOR EVERYTHING FROM TELLING THE TIME TO ORGANISING A DAY OF THE RISKS OF PUTTING ALL OUR ELECTRONIC EGGS IN ONE BASKET
BEREAVED FAMILIES COULD BE FORCED TO PAY WHAT AMOUNTS TO A NEW DEATH TAX OF UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH UNDER PROPOSED GOVERNMENT CHANGES TO PROBATE FEES IT SAYS THE REFORMS ARE DESIGNED TO BE FAIRER TO POORER FAMILIES BUT THOSE INHERITING A FAMILY HOME WORTH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOULD NOW FACE A CHARGE OF A THOUSAND MORE THAN SIX TIMES THE CURRENT LEVEL THE FEE PAID BY FAMILIES WITH THEN RISE SHARPLY DEPENDING ON THE VALUE OF THE ESTATE
THE EXPRESS IS ONE OF THE PAPERS REPORTED THE BIGGEST SHAKE UP OF THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST SCORING SYSTEM SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE FINALISTS AT THIS YEAR'S EVENT IN STOCKHOLM ON MAY THE FOURTEENTH WILL COMPETE FOR TWICE AS MANY POINTS AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS WITH EACH COUNTRY BEING GIVEN TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF SCORES ONE AWARDED BY A PUBLIC VOTE THE OTHER BY AN EXPERT JURY BECAUSE IT REDUCES THE CHANCES OF SCORING ZERO

MAYBE MAYBE NOT THE TIME IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MENUS THIS MORNING'S THE TALKS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT IN BRUSSELS ABOUT CHANGE US BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP THE DOWNING STREET AS WARNED THAT MUCH MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO REACH AN AGREEMENT
ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE EARLIEST COMPLETE BRONZE AGE WHEEL IN BRITAIN AT A DIG IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE IT'S A LARGE WOODEN WHEEL AND DATES FROM ABOUT ONE THOUSAND YEARS B.C. WERE MARK NIGHT IS THE SITE'S DIRECTOR HE'S FROM THE CAMBRIDGE ARCHAEOLOGICAL UNIT AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY AND HE JOINS US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOW THIS IS ALL THAT'S IN THE BRONZE AGE IT'S A WOODEN WHEEL
YES IT'S A TRIPARTITE WELL IT'S MADE OF FREE PANELS BRACED TOGETHER WAS SORT OF A DOVETAIL BRACE AS A HUB IN THE CENTRE AND LIKE TO HAVE MOON SHAPES EITHER SIDE OF THE HARBOUR RIGHT WE THAT WE DO HAVE EARLIER WOODEN WHEELS BUT NO NOT AS SOPHISTICATED AS THIS
OR NOT AS COMPLETE AND NOT AS WELL PRESERVED AND I MEAN MOST OF THE YEARLY WILL'S OLD STILL DATING TO THE LATE BRONZE AGE ANYWAY SO THAT THE ROUGHLY CONTEMPORARY
GOSH THAT REALLY IS HOW HOW IS IT MANAGED TO SURVIVE A COMBINATION OF IT BEING IN A IN A RIVER SO IT'S PRESERVED FREE WATERLOGGING ALSO WAS CAUGHT IN THE FIRE OF FOR SETTLEMENT SO IT'S ALSO BEEN CHARRED SO IT'S CAUGHT IN THAT SORT OF PERFECT SORT OF PRESERVATION QUE CONDITIONS WE OFTEN WE THINK OF THE WHEEL ARE SORT OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT MARKER OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILISATION AND YET SURPRISINGLY FEW SURVIVE DON'T THEY
ABSOLUTELY I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S ITS RARITY THAT IS IS A SURPRISE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WERE DIGGING UP OLD DWELLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FENS ARE THE LAST THING WE EXPECTED TO FIND WAS A WAS A WEE HILL DO YOU KNOW CAN YOU TELL WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED FOR
A CART WE'D LIKE TO THINK MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE A CHARIOT TO MAYBE IT SORT OF ORNATE MISSING THINGS WAS ABOUT SORT OF SHOWING OFF AND THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LEFT YOUR POD RUNNING WENT UP INTO THE FIELDS AND THINGS AND THAT WAS YOUR SORT OF YOUR SUNDAY BEST VEHICLE THING BUT WAS IT IN SUCH A CONDITION THAT YOU COULD USE IT NOW NO NOT AT ALL IT'S IT'S PAPER THIN IT'S REALLY YEAH
I KNOW IT'S IN IT'S ON MUST FARM WHICH I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN OVERSEEING THE EXCAVATION OF WHAT A WHAT HAVE BEEN THE SORT A CYGNET BUT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FINDS THERE WHAT'S THE SITE LIKE
ASTONISHING IT'S THIS BASICALLY ARTICULATED REMAINS OF COLLAPSE ROUND HOUSES WITH ALL THE CONTENTS STILL INSIDE WE IT WAS STARTING TO FOREIGN TEXTILES WERE FUNNY LITTLE WOODEN BOXES WE HAVE COMPLETE POTS WITH A FOOD INSIDE OF THEM THERE ARE SPOONS WOODEN PLATTERS IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ARCHAEOLOGY ANY MORE IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE DOING SOME KIND OF ETHNOGRAPHY IT'S JUST AT THE PEOPLE HAVE JUST LEFT
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S SO WELL PRESERVED AND IT'S FROM THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO IT WAS BURIED UNDER METRES OF SEDIMENT IT WAS COMPLETELY SEALED IN THIS THIS LOVELY SORT OF BENIGN SILT AND THINGS AND IT'S JUST KEPT THIS THING IN PERFECT CONDITION SO WHAT EVERY DAY YOU GO YOU'RE YOU'RE FINDING NEW STUFF
EVERY DAY AND YOU JUST YOU SORT OF WONDER WHAT'S NEXT ON THE LIST THAT COULD COME UP ON THE SITE WHEN THE WHEEL WAS NEVER ON A LESS THAN AND IT CAME UP AND IT WAS THE FANTASTIC SO O. KAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TELLING US ABOUT IT MARK NIGHT THANKS THANK YOU
AND THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY INHERIT HEART CONDITIONS FROM A PARENT AS THEY'RE OFTEN DIAGNOSE WRONGLY IF AT ALL NO THERE IS A NEW TEST THAT COULD HELP AN AWFUL LOT OF THEM I'M JOINED BY SHANNON DONOVAN WHO HAS A GENETIC HEART CONDITION
OH SORRY C. T. V. T. AND THAT'S AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT SHANNON YES CAN CAUSE COLLAPSES ALL CARDIAC ARREST RIGHT AND ALSO IN THE STUDIO DOCTOR TESSA HUMPHREY WHO IS A CONSULTANT IN MEDICAL GENETICS BUT TELL US WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU
SO I STARTED COLLAPSING AROUND THE AGE OF NINE AND WAS THEIR MISDIAGNOSED OF EPILEPSY COS IT'S QUITE EPILEPSY BECAUSE THEY'RE FAINTS KIND OF LOOK LIKE EPILEPTIC SEIZURES IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE BECAUSE MY NAME HE SHOWS UP AND EXERCISE AND KEPT PUSHING AND PUSHING AND EVENTUALLY REFERRED TO THE BROMPTON AND THEY FOUND OUT I HAD C.P. V.A.T.
AND INITIALLY WHEN THEY LET THE GENE THAT WAS CAUSING IT THEY CAN FIND
THEY LOOK TO GO IN THE YEAR OR SO LATER AND ABLE TO SEE IT SO WHAT AGE WERE YOU AT THAT POINT I WAS FOURTEEN WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED RIGHT AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE SO PUT ON MEDICATION WHICH MADE ME REALLY FATIGUED AND I ALSO HAVE A RECORDING DEVICE IN MY CHEST
TO HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE OPERATION SO FEW BITS AND BOBS YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NO I MEAN YOU LOOK VERY WELL YEAH NO I'M A LOT BETTER NOW A LOT LOT BETTER ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I'M NOT ON SUCH A HIGH DOSAGE OF THE MEDICATION THAT MADE ME FEEL SO TIRED
RIGHT WHAT DIFFERENCE WITH THESE NEW TESTS MAKE CLINT UP ANDREW WELL I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE ARE NOW ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THESE PATIENTS EFFECTIVELY AT WHAT SORT OF AGE WILL YOU CAN DIAGNOSE THEM WHENEVER THEY START TO PRESENT BUT A LOT OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE FAMILIAL AND FOR SHANNON'S GET DISEASE YOU ONLY PICK THIS UP ON EXERCISE TESTING SO WILL ACTUALLY MISSIT ON AND UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE
SO FOR INSTANCE SHE LOST DAY AT HER FATHER'S BROTHER DIED AGED TWENTY JUST COLLAPSED IN THE STREET AND NOW THAT WE WOULD NOW BE ABLE TO SCREEN HER WHOLE FAMILY AND SAY WHO ELSE IS AT RISK FROM GETTING THESE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS AND WE HAVE NOW BEEN ABLE TO DIAGNOSE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PUT THEM ON TREATMENT
SO THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THESE CATASTROPHIC AFFECTS CARDIAC ARRESTS ALL IT HAD THE BEST SIMPLE FAINTS SHANNON'S A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE SMALL OPERATION THAT SHE IS ACTUALLY HAD TO AT THE BROMPTON WHICH HAS PREVENTED HAVING THE NASTY SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE DRUGS THAT SHE WAS PREVIOUSLY ON
AND WHAT ABOUT ANY CHILDREN I'M ASSUMING YOU DON'T HAVE CHILDREN WHAT ABOUT ANY CHILDREN SHE MIGHT HAVE BUT WHAT HAVE MY CHILDREN ARE AT A FIFTY FIFTY RISK OF HAVING THIS REALLY PRETTY UNPLEASANT CONDITION NOW THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED THE GENE THROUGH THIS VERY LARGE PANEL AND THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE CAUSED BY THAT WE CAN NOW OFFER US SOMETHING CALLED PRE IMPLANTATION GENETIC DIAGNOSIS WE CAN SELECT EMBRYOS
THAT DO NOT CARRY THE GENE AND WE'VE CERTAINLY GOT PATIENTS GOING THROUGH IS THAT AT THE MOMENT WITH EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM THAT SHE'S GOT SO SHE CAN ACTUALLY GUARANTEE THAT SHE CAN HAVE FIT HEALTHY CHILDREN THAT DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT SHE DOES AND THAT REASSURES YOU LIKE THAT ABSOLUTELY HUGE THING WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED AT FOURTEEN I WAS LIKE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ME HAVING CHILDREN I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO MATERNAL AND I MY DAD ACTUALLY HAS THE SAME CONDITION HE'S MADE BUT THEY DID AND NAIA INTEL
I WAS FOURTEEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED AFTER ME REALLY SO HE HAD IT ALL HIS LIFE UNTIL YOU COLLAPSED AS WELL BUT I DON'T THINK C.P. VETOED EVEN BEEN DISCOVERED IT'S DISCOVERED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES BUT OBVIOUSLY HE PASSED IT ON TO ME AND I WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY GUILT RIDDEN AND IF I KNOW THAT I'D PASSED SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON TO MY CHILD AND THEY'D HAD A CARDIAC ARREST
SUB SORT OF GOD WHO WOULD NOT AS IF IT'S YOUR FAULT IF I KNOWINGLY NO NO I DON'T ALLOW THAT THERE'S PREVENTATIVE MEASURES YES EXACTLY SO SO DOES IT MEAN GEOGRAPHY THAT WE'VE KILLED THIS DISEASE OFF I MEAN WE WE HAVE ACTUALLY GOT A GRIP ON IT COMPLETE THESE DISEASES RATHER THAN THIS IT WAS NOT A NUMBER ON THAT WE CAN'T POSSIBLY SAY WE'VE KILLED OFF THE DISEASE BECAUSE THESE STARK REOCCURRING THEY HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE
SO THE FIRST PERSON THAT GETS THE DISEASE WE ARE NOT GOING TO UNDERTAKE POPULATION SCREENING FOR THESE INCREDIBLY RARE DISEASES SO THEY ARE VERY AWARE THEY ARE RARE THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY RARE PROBABLY LESS THAN ONE IN TEN THOUSAND THINGS LIKE OTHER ARRHYTHMIAS AND ROOMS SUCH AS A LONG Q. T. POTENTIALLY A ONE IN TWO THOUSAND SO THEY ARE MORE COMMON
BUT THERE IS POTENTIAL E.C.G. SCREENING WITH THIS AND THEN WE CAN UNDERTAKE GENETIC TESTING BUT THIS IS NOT FOR POPULATION SCREENING THE PROBLEM WITH WE'RE LOOKING AT GENETICS YOU PICK UP LOTS OF NOISE AND ACTUALLY DO WE WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT OURSELVES I'M NOT SURE WE REALLY DO WHY NOT IN A MEDICAL SENSE WHY NOT DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW JOHN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU YOU MIGHT BE SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNRELATED AND WHAT'S THE EXCITING THING ABOUT
THIS GENE PANEL IS IT IS REALLY JUST LOOKING FOR CARDIAC DISEASE SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIND OUT IF I'M GOING TO GO DEMENTED IT'S NOT GOING TO FIND OUT ANYTHING ELSE SO IT IS SPECIFIC FOR THE DISEASES THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT BUT IT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF GENES THAT CAN CAUSE A SIMILAR TYPE OF ABNORMALITY SO FOUR
SHANNON'S PROBLEM THAT YOU COULD POTENTIALLY BE C. P. V. T. BUT SHE COULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING LIKE A LONG Q.T. AND BY BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS AT ONCE WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THE COST OF DOING THESE TESTS RIGHT DOWN BUT ALSO WE CAN MAKE A DIAGNOSIS IN MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE BUT IT IS NOT FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION DO WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING
IT WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR IT NOW BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHER TIME TESSA THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE IS NO DEAL YET HERE IN BRUSSELS DESPITE SOME VERY LATE MEETINGS ANY BROKE UP A FEW HOURS AGO AND THEY'LL PICK UP AGAIN SHORTLY THERE IS STILL NO A DETERMINATION IT SEEMS TO SORT IT OUT TODAY WHEN THE MEETING OF ALL TWENTY EIGHT LEADERS FINALLY CAME TO AN END LAST NIGHT STEFFAN WILL OFTEN THE PRIME MINISTER OF SWEDEN SAID EVERYONE IN THE ROOM WAS CO OPERATING TO AVOID BREAKS IT
AND WE SHOULD HAVE A CLIP OF HIM WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT U.K. STAYS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR BEFORE YOU'VE BEEN EUROVISION AS WELL AS BEING
WE DO NOT NEED EUROPEAN UNION CANNOT ALTOGETHER SO WE YES WE ARE DETERMINED THAT WE WANT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THE AMBITION IS TO DO IT AS QUICK AS POSS
AS PRIME MINISTER CAN SERVE HIMSELF IT'S NOT THE TIME TO STOP THEM
IS THAT WE HAVE A GOOD
IT WAS THE SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER SPEAKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT STEFAN OFTEN WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF DAVID CAMERON'S NEGOTIATIONS HIM BRUSSELS WHAT EFFECT HAVE THEY HAD ON HOW BRITAIN IS VIEWED IN EUROPE I'M TRYING TO IN THE STUDIO BY PHILIPPE LAMBERT WHO IS A BELGIAN M.E.P. HE CO CHAIRS THE EUROPEAN FREELANCE AND GREEN GROUP IN THE COMMISSION BUILDING JUST BEHIND ME JUST ACROSS THE ROAD FROM OUR LITTLE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
DO YOU THINK THIS HAS MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE WAY THAT BRITAIN IS SEEN AND NOT EVER SINCE CAMERON AN ARMISTICE IS REFERENDUM I THINK THIS ADI NEEDED IN FROM MOST OTHER LEADERS INCLUDING THOSE WHO WERE MORE OF THE EURO SCEPTIC KIND BECAUSE NO ONE WANTED TO FOLLOW CAN RUN ON A POTENTIALLY EXIT TRAWLED THE INFLUENCE OFF TO UNITED KINGDOM
AS BE REDUCED BY BY USE MOVES AND QUITE FRANKLY A NUMBER OF US I'D BE ANNOYED AT THE FACT THAT THIS WHOLE REFERENDUM BUSINESS IS VERY MUCH ABOUT SOLVING INTERNAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY SHOES RATHER DEN REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF EUROPE SO YOU NEED TO FIND AN EXCUSE WHO CAMPAIGNED FOR THE YES I BELIEVED THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT WILL COME OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT
THE UNITED KINGDOM SHOULD STAY SALT OR ANY PLEASED OF SIX BRITISH ANY PEAS THAT ARE PART OF MY GROUP WILL CAMPAIGN FOR THE YES REGARDLESS OF WHAT OF TODAY'S TALK IS ALL IMPORTANT SO IT WAS OR WHATEVER IS THAT WHETHER IT'S WHEREVER THEY ARE LAND OR THE END EXACTLY DISCUSSIONS HOWEVER MUCH IT'S WATERED DOWN THERE'S YOUR VEGETABLES BOTH FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM AND FOR THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN BY A BREAK OR BETWEEN YOUR DISMISSIVE OF HIS REASONS FOR DOING THIS BUT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID THAT WHAT HE'S HOPING TO DO
IS TO READ BRITISH POLITICS OF A RUNNING SORE TO SETTLED THE DISCUSSION FOR A GENERATION WELL I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS WILL ALL BE SETTLED FOR A GENERATION BECAUSE WELL YOU YOU WILL HAVE BY PROPERTY PUBLIC OPINION THAT WE REMAIN EUROSCEPTIC NOT JUST IN THE U.K. ABOUT AWAY BUT IN MANY OTHER MEMBER STATES SO LET'S FACE IT IT'S NOT JUST A BRITISH PHENOMENON IT MAYBE MORE ACUTE IN YOUR COUNTRY
BUT WE ARE GROWING YOUR SCEPTICISM ACROSS EUROPE NOW HOW DO WE REALLY GET RID OFF THAT BY MAKING EUROPE WORK FOR EVERYONE AND NOT JUST FOR A MINORITY BUT IN A WAY THAT MANY PEOPLE LISTEN TO THAT AND THINK YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT EUROPEAN LEADERS THINK HE'S PLAYING WITH FIRE AND THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES THIS RISK OF CONTAGION YES WHAT'S SURELY THAT SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY UNHAPPY AT THE EUROPEAN UNION ONE AND THEY WANT THIS AND IT IS THIS IS THAT NOT A POLITICAL LEADER DOING THE RIGHT THING
WELL I THINK THAT THE DIAGNOSIS IS RIGHT BUT I AM THAT THEIR BERRIES GROWING EUROSCEPTICS HE HAS BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT HE'S GOT THAT HE'S GOT THE REASONS RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF BODY DICKING AROUND THAT I THINK THAT IF EUROPE RECEDES BIG EUROPEAN DREAM IS RECEDING NOT JUST IN THE U.K. BUT ELSEWHERE IS BECAUSE INCREASINGLY EUROPE AS BEING WELL ABANDONING ITS DREAM OF THEIR SHARED INTEREST SALEABLE PROSPERITY THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT I MEAN A LOT
WELL YOU'RE UP TO FILL UP WITH HOW SHOULD I SEE YES A PROSPERITY THIS WERE SHARED BY ALL CITIZENS AND NOT JUST A MINORITY AND THAT WAS BASICALLY THE FIRST YEAR'S HAVE TO EUROPEAN CONSTRUCTION BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN OFTEN OF LATE IS THAT INCREASING INEQUALITIES IN EUROPE INCREASING POWER WERE AFTER BIG BUSINESS ANT
THAT IS FUELLING WE THEN BURNT ACROSS EUROPE IN MY COUNTRY BELGIUM HAS BEEN A FEDERALIST COUNTRY FOR DECADES BUT EVEN IN BELGIUM WE INCREASINGLY PEOPLE SAYING WELL IF EUROPE IS WORKING FOR BIG BUSINESS NO THANKS O.K. BUT IT WAS PERHAPS AN INTEREST AND THEN YOU SPEAK TO HER AS A FEDERALIST BRITAIN IS STILL AN ISLAND PERHAPS STILL HAS AN IRELAND MENTALITY AND CANNOT WILL NEVER
I THINK AS THE BELGIANS DO SURE I'M SURE BUT AGAIN I ONE DAY CRECY DID EUROPEAN UNION AND YES WE WOULD NOT SHAPE EUROPE THE BELGIAN SWAMPED IT THAT'S THE WHOLE STORY OF EUROPE IT'S TRYING TO BUILD SOMETHING TOGETHER THAT WILL NEVER BE A PERFECT CONSTRUCTION BUT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER THAT'S WHAT I REALLY BELIEVE A QUICK WORD FRANCE A BELGIAN UNDERSTOOD STOOD TO BE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING SIGNED IN THAT SAYS THIS IS IT NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS NO SECOND REFERENDUM
WOULD YOU WELCOME A WELL I THINK THAT YOU CAN NEVER SAY NEVER ESPECIALLY IN BELGIUM WHEN IT COMES TO STATE REFORM BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD SETTLE IT FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME BUT NEVER SAY NEVER IN POLITICS PHILIPPE LAMBETH THANKS VERY MUCH MY PLEASURE

BELGIUM AND FRANCE MEANWHILE ARE PUSHING FOR LANGUAGE TO BE INSERTED IN THE DOCUMENT TO EMPHASISE THAT THIS IS A FINAL OFFER AND THAT REJECTING IT WOULD KILL OFF THE CHANCE OF ANY SECOND REFERENDUM IN THE U.K.
THE IRISH PRIME MINISTER ENDA KENNY WANT IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REACH A DEAL THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL SAID ONE OF THE MAIN AREAS OF DISCUSSION DURING THE FIRST SET OF TALKS CONCERNED THE PROPOSALS TO TIGHTEN BENEFITS SHE SAID THERE WAS A WILL TO HELP BRITAIN EVEN THOUGH OTHER COUNTRIES WEREN'T FINDING IT EASY TO AGREE TO DAVID CAMERON'S REQUESTS

LEGISLATION BETHANY BELL REPORTS FROM AUSTRIA'S BORDER WITH SLOVENIA
A TWO AND A HALF MILE FENCE NOW RUNS ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN AUSTRIA AND SLOVENIA HAD SPIEL FELT DESPITE THE FACT THAT BOTH COUNTRIES ARE IN EUROPE'S PASSPORT FREE SHAMANS
GROUPS OF MIGRANTS INCLUDING WOMEN AND SMALL CHILDREN A BARRIER BEFORE THEY'RE SEARCHED QUESTIONED AND HAVE THEIR DOCUMENTS CHECKED MANY OF THEM WANT TO TRAVEL NORTH TO GERMANY BUT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN AUSTRIA
THE POLICE SAY THEY'LL SHUT THE BORDER IF MORE THAN EIGHTY PEOPLE CLAIM ASYLUM HERE IN A DAY OR IF MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED ONE TO TRANSIT THROUGH
THEY SAY THERE'S NUMBERS HAVEN'T BEEN REACHED YET BUT AUSTRIA'S LEADERS FEAR IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME UNLESS AN E.U. WIDE SOLUTION CAN BE AGREED
A NEW TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETECT INHERITED CART HEART CONDITIONS RESEARCHERS WHO RECEIVED FUNDS FROM THE BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION SO THE TEST WILL BE QUICKER AND CHEAPER THAN EXISTING EXAMINATIONS HERE'S FRANKIE MY COMELY
INHERITED HEART CONDITIONS AFFECTS MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.K. FOR MANY THE FIRST SIGN THEY HAVE A CONDITION IS WHEN A FAMILY MEMBER DIES SUDDENLY WITH NO OBVIOUS EXPLANATION GENETIC TESTING HER FAMILY MEMBERS CAN PINPOINT FAULTY GENES LEADING TO THE POSSIBILITY OF EARLY TREATMENT
PREVIOUS TESTS LOOKED AT A SMALLER NUMBER OF GENES AND COULD ONLY IDENTIFY A LIMITED NUMBER OF INHERITED HEART CONDITIONS WHERE IS THIS NEW TEST DEVELOPED BY RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR GENES AND CAN DETECT ALL KNOWN CONDITIONS THE BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION HAS SAID THIS LATEST EXAMINATION COULD INCREASE THE CHANCE OF DIAGNOSING POTENTIALLY FATAL DEFECTS IT IS ALREADY IN USE IN ONE N.H.S. TRUST BUT IT'S EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN UP IN OTHERS
OFFICIALS IN CALIFORNIA SO ONE OF THE WORST GAS LEAKS IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS FINALLY BEEN SEALED TONS OF METHANE SPEWED FROM A RUPTURED WELL FOR FOUR MONTHS DRIVING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES THE COMPANY THAT OPERATES THE WELL IS FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES WHICH IT DENYS
A NEW TELEPHONE BANKING SECURITY SYSTEM WHICH RECOGNISES A CUSTOMER'S VOICE WITHOUT NEEDING A PASSWORD IS BEING LAUNCHED BY H.S.B.C. THE BANK SAYS IT'S PLANNING THE BIGGEST ROLL OUT SO FAR A VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN BRITISH BANKING HERE'S OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT RORY KIRTLAND JOAN'S DOING EVERYTHING WITH YOUR BANK ACCOUNT VIA THE TELEPHONE CAN BE A CUMBERSOME BUSINESS PLEASE O.K. YOUR
BUT NOW SOMETHING CALLED VOICE BIOMETRICS COULD MAKE IT A LOT SIMPLER WHEN THEY ENROL IN THE SERVICE A B. C. CUSTOMERS WILL CHAT FOR A SHORT WHILE TO A CALL CENTRE AGENT WHILE THEIR VOICES ANALYSED THE NEXT TIME THEY CALL THEIR VOICE ALONE SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY THEM WITHOUT HAVING TO REMEMBER PASSWORDS AND OTHER DETAILS
BARCLAYS WEALTH CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN USING A SIMILAR SERVICE FOR SOME TIME AND THE BANK SAYS IT'S PROVED SO POPULAR THAT IT WILL BE ROLLED OUT TO ALL ACCOUNT HOLDERS SOON ACROSS THE BANKING INDUSTRY BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS WHICH PROMISES A CURE BUT SIMPLER ACCESS TO ACCOUNTS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY FASHIONABLE
A NEW REPORT CLAIMS THAT A TWENTY PERCENT TAX ON SUGARY DRINKS COULD REDUCE OBESITY RATES IN THE U.K. BY FIVE PERCENT OVER THE NEXT DECADE HE'D CANCER RESEARCH U.K. AND THE U.K. HEALTH FORUM I'VE WORKED OUT THE LIKELY IMPACT OF THE TAX ON EATING HABITS AND THE NATION'S WAISTLINES MARK SANDERS REPORTS
MAKING US PAY MORE FOR SOMETHING SWEET TO DRINK COULD HELP PREVENT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BECOMING FATTER AND PUTTING THEIR HEALTH AT RISK THAT'S THE VIEW OF TWO CHARITIES CANCER RESEARCH U.K. AND THE U.K. HEALTH FORUM THERE REPORT SAYS A TWENTY PER CENT TAX ON SUGARY DRINKS COULD PREVENT THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION CASES OF OBESITY OVER THE NEXT DECADE
THEIR STUDY ALSO PREDICTS THE TAX COULD SAVE THE N.H.S. ABOUT TEN MILLION POUNDS IN HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL CARE COSTS IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ALONE
SEVERAL CHARITIES AND CAMPAIGNERS INCLUDING THE CHEF JAMIE OLIVER HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR A SUGAR TAX BUT THE BODY THAT REPRESENTS SOFT DRINKS MANUFACTURERS SAYS THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT SUCH TAXES HAVE AN EFFECT ON OBESITY
THE GOVERNMENT IS DUE TO PUBLISH ITS CHILDHOOD OBESITY STRATEGY AND DAVID CAMERON RECENTLY HINTED A SUGAR TAX HAD NOT BEEN RULED OUT
MARGARET THATCHER'S FLAGSHIP POLL TAX REFORMS ALARMED HER MINISTERS SO MUCH THAT ONE OF THEM MORE AND IT COULD LEAD TO PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS TO AVOID THE CHARGE IT'S EMERGED IN CABINET FILES MADE PUBLIC TODAY AFTER THIRTY YEARS AT THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES IN WEST LONDON THE PAPERS ALSO REVEAL A BATTLE OF WILLS WITH THE NEWSPAPER PROPRIETOR ROBERT MAXWELL AS RICHARD SLEE REPORTS
NEWLY RELEASED DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT MISSUS THATCHER REFUSED TO BAIL OUT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX COMMONWEALTH GAMES DESPITE BEING ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE ONE MILLION POUNDS BY ROBERT MAXWELL THE MIRROR TYCOON WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE GAMES COMMITTEE AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF SPONSORSHIP
AND THERE WAS ALSO STRIFE IN THE THATCHER CABINET OVER THE POLL TAX WITH MINISTERS REPEATEDLY WARNING THAT IT WOULD BE A POLITICAL DISASTER WIDESPREAD PROTESTS AGAINST THE NEW TAX IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE ARE SEEN AS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MARGARET THATCHER WAS FORCED OUT OF NUMBER TEN THE FOLLOWING
RESEARCH COMMISSIONED BY THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT HAS FIND THAT POLLUTION HAS TURNED THE COUNTRY'S OCEANS INTO WHAT THEY'VE CALLED A PLASTIC SOUP THE RESEARCHERS ESTIMATE THERE ARE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE BILLION PIECES OF PLASTIC WASTE IN AUSTRALIAN WATERS BE SPODE
THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN A LOT REMAINS TO BE DONE THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK SAID IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING WHEN THE MEETING OF ALL TWENTY EIGHT LEADERS FINALLY BROKE OUT BROKE UP THERE THEN FOLLOWED A SERIES OF MEETINGS BETWEEN DAVID CAMERON AND A FEW OTHER LEADERS
THE ONLY LEFT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL BUILDING A SHORT DISTANCE FROM HERE ABOUT FIVE THIRTY THIS MORNING SO WHAT CHANCE IS THERE THAT A DEAL CAN BE DONE ARE AFTER THOSE MEETINGS ARE RECONVENE SHORTLY A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS IS WITH ME HERE IN A LITTLE BRUSSEL STUDIO AND OPERATING ON VERY LITTLE SLEEP BUT FROM WHAT YOU WERE ABLE TO GATHER WHEN THE MEETING'S BROKE UP LAST NIGHT I MEAN THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT PROGRESS BUT A LONG WAY TO GO DO WE KNOW WHAT PROGRESS AND HOW FAR TO GO
WELL FIRST OF ALL SARAH WHAT A WAITER WORLD I MEAN DAVID CAMERON URGING OTHER E.U. LEADERS TO END THE U.K. ISSUE FOR A GENERATION MANY OF THEM PUSHING BACK AND TRYING TO WATER DOWN THE TEXT THAT WAS ALREADY ON THE TABLE AND DON'T FORGET TWENTY EIGHT NATIONAL LEADERS ONLY FINISHED AT ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING HAVING A PRETTY
DIFFICULT DEBATE ABOUT MIGRATION SUMMED UP BEST PAT BY THE GREEK PRIME MINISTER ALEXIS SIT PRESS WHO SAID THE U.K. MAY HAVE A REFERENDUM IN JUNE WE'VE GOT A CRISIS HITTING US RIGHT NOW SO THERE WAS A LOT OF IRRITATION WITH DAVID CAMERON TO START WITH THEY WERE HAVING SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THIS BUT THEY HAD TO GET BACK TO THE U.K. SHE WOULD GET IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SO IS AT ABOUT TWO THIRTY A.M. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SUMMIT DONALD TUSK CAME OUT BRIEFLY WITH THIS
BRITAIN WAS THE SUBJECT OF OUR DOGS TODAY FOR MO I CAN WELL IF THEY HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS BUT LODZ THROUGH REMAINS TO BE DONE
AWAY WE WERE ALL FURIOUS BAILOUT THE ONLY THING SO I THINK WITH PRIME MINISTER CAMERON PRESIDENT PRIME MINISTER FOR VODKA AND FINEST ONLY SHOW OBVIOUSLY TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN PLOT OF COMMISSIONERS ALSO CLEANED IF IN THIS PROCESS THANK YOU
I WAS SURE THE GOODS AND LONG CLOTHES WELL IT WAS A LONG NIGHTS THEY KEPT GOING TILL ROUGHLY FIVE OR FIVE THIRTY IN THE MORNING OBVIOUSLY DAVID CAMERON WAS IN THERE WE'RE TOLD THAT THE THE BILATERAL MEETINGS WITH FRANCOIS ALONG WERE LONG AND COMPLEX THE CZECH PRIME MINISTER REPRESENTING COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE OBVIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT
CHILD BENEFIT ALSO THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT BRITAIN MIGHT BE ABLE TO UTILISE THIS EMERGENCY BRAKE ON RESTRICTIONS IN WORK BENEFITS DAVID CAMERON'S PITCH FOR THIRTEEN YEARS IN TOTAL EAST EUROPEANS ARE TALKING ABOUT FIVE YEARS THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE SORTED OUT AND THEN THE BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER IN THERE
TALKING TRYING TO DEFEND THE IDEA OF SOVEREIGNTY EVER CLOSER UNION WANTING TO HAVE SOMETHING WHICH SAYS THIS IS THE ONLY TIME YOU HAVE A REFERENDUM IT'S A ONE SHOT DEAL IF YOU REJECT IT NOW NO SECOND REFERENDUM WHICH IS ONE THING THAT SOME PEOPLE IN THE LEAF CAMPAIGNING IN THE U.K. HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SO PLENTY STILL TO DO CHRIS WE OFTEN GET CHIDED FOR BEING SUCKERED INTO THIS IDEA THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S REALLY GOING TO THE LINE AND ACTUALLY THIS IS ALL DELIBERATELY CHOREOGRAPHED
CAN THE CAN YOU SAY I MEAN IT'S IT'S WHEN YOU'RE SITTING HERE AND WHEN YOU'RE UP IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING TO THINK SERIOUSLY BUT A WILL THE DEAL BE DONE IS AN INEVITABLE THING BUT PEOPLE ON ALL SIDES SPIN THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT ONLY TO CLAIM VICTORY FROM THE JAWS OF DEFEAT
THAT'S KIND OF STANDARD DIPLOMATIC PRACTICE BUT ARE THERE REAL SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES HERE SURE THERE ARE I MEAN THAT AND SOME OF THEM OF COURSE IRONICALLY ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE AREN'T REALLY GOING TO VOTE ON WHEN IT COMES TO A REFERENDUM BUT CRUCIAL LONG TERM THINGS LIKE FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS FOR THE CITY OF LONDON
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU TALK ABOUT YESTERDAY THOUGH HE'S AN EXAMPLE HOW DIFFICULT IT HAS BEEN FOR DAVID CAMERON THE PROBLEM OF CONTAGION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES FEEL EMBOLDENED TO TRY TO ASK THE SPECIAL DEALS AND RE NEGOTIATIONS FOLLOWING THE BRITISH EXAMPLE THE DUTCH PRIME MINISTER MARK HAVING WATCHED DAVID CAMERON TRYING TO DO THIS WAS PRETTY ASTONISHED
YOU'VE SEEN THE STRUGGLE I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS TO GROWTH WILL GET GOT DEAL HE HAS STOOL AND MY SISTERS THIS IS NOT EASY FOR HIM AND WHAT IS YOUR BRASS
STICK HOW OF TIME SO SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS A PROCESS WHICH IS
TEMPTING FOR OTHERS TOO WERE TALKED TO GO INTO PARK GROCER THERE IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING CHRIS MORRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE OF THOSE CLOSELY INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS KNOWN AS A SHERPA BECAUSE THEY DO A LOT OF THE HEAVY LIFTING IS THE GERMAN M.E.P. ALMA BROCK AND HE'S HERE WITH US
IN A STUDIO AS WELL GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MONARCH AND WHEN HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED TO BE CALLED BACK IN TO DO THE NEXT STAGE OF OF REMOVING THE SQUARE BRACKETS AS THEY TALK ABOUT TRYING TO NAIL THINGS DOWN IN THE DETAIL WE REALLY FURTHER DISCUSSION IT WAS GLASGOW DRUG LOOK YOUNGER AT TWELVE THIRTY BUT IT MEANS WE NEED INSULATION GOOD START AFTERWARDS SOIL LEVEL AT ALL OF THEM BUT IT WAS
OF TUSCAN YOUR GLOVE WITH THE LEADERS OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS O.K. SO THAT MEANS ALL MORNING YOU HAVE MEETINGS BETWEEN DAVID CAMERON AND OTHER LEADERS TO TRY TO NAIL DOWN THE INDIVIDUAL THINGS THEY WANT BY THE TIME YOU GET THEM BACK IN IT BECAUSE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEING AN ENGLISH BREAKFAST IT'S BECOMING AN ENGLISH LUNCH
DO WE ASSUME THAT THAT MEANS EVERYTHING SORTED BY THE TIME YOU'RE INVOLVED THAT THEY WANT TO TALK WITH EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT LARS BECAUSE OF SPECIAL RUAIRI SPLIT A BLEND THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE QUESTION OF SOCIAL BENEFITS COLLISIONS THAT'S ALL THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SAY TO GUEST OF THAT I WAS I WAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS OF THE PARLIAMENT AND HAVE ASSUMED THAT WILLIAM WALLACE AT THE END THERE BELOW THEM
THEY'LL BE ASKED SUCH A COMPROMISE RETREATS FROM ER DRINK IT WAS ACCEPTABLE FOR US RIGHT SEE SO AS A PARLIAMENTARIAN YOU HAVE TO EFFECTIVELY SIGN OFF AND SAY LOOK WE CAN GET THIS THROUGH THE PARLIAMENT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAD BEEN PLANNED CERTAINLY IN BRITAIN WAS A CABINET MEETING THIS AFTERNOON I MEAN THE TIMINGS DO NOT ALLOW FOR THAT OR DO THEY I MEAN ARE WE AT A POINT WHERE IT COULD BE THAT THE TIMING SLIP SO MUCH THAT WE'RE WHAT INTO TOMORROW
THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE IS ALSO THE POSSIBLY THAT ALTERS BY LIBERALS SLEPT ON SCHOOL CAN LEAD TO A BUTCHER'S TO PROPOSAL BRIDGES MORRIS ALREADY EXCEPT
EVERYBODY WERE LITERALLY FILES RELATIVELY LONG NOBODY LOOKS AT THIS THE QUESTION YOU KNOW ROD LUNCHEON BUT WHAT'S SEEM STRIKING HERE IS THAT WHEN THEY SAT DOWN LAST NIGHT AND DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE STILL VERY FAR APART AND WE'RE HERE IN VERY FAR APART ON SOME ISSUES AND YOU KNOW ALL THESE ISSUES COS YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN DRAWING IT UP THESE ARE THE SAME ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR WEEKS AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE ANY CLOSER
IT IS AS ALWAYS A LOT OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THING STOOD ALL OF US IN THE LAST ONE OF US HAS THE SIBHSE HE ACCEPTS YOUR PLACE AND THAT IS WHERE IT HAPPENS I THINK THE MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED BIRD TREATY CHANGE WILL THEY BE TREATED BUT IT IS POSSIBLE IF THERE ARE A LOT I THINK HE'S AGREED BUT I MIGHT BE TREATED CHANGE THAT HE'D SAID THAT THE EURO BRITAIN HAS AN EXCEPTION FONDLE FOR THEIR POLITICAL INDICA
AND HERE'S ONE AS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE'D BITE BE POSSIBLE IT VILL BE CLEAR THAT BRITAIN WILL HAVE NO DISADVANTAGES ANON YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT WAS IN THE INTERNAL MARKET
WHAT WAS KNOWN AS REEDED NOW PASSED BY THE FRENCH AND OTHERS BUT IT HASN'T SHOULD NOT END ADVANTAGES ARE PART OF THAT HEAVEN PLAYING ELEVEN A FIELD
AND LITTLE PINK FEEL AND I THINK THIS IS SMALLER SORTED I'LL BE UNKNOWN THAT DIFFICULT QUESTION OF SOCIAL BENEFITS BUT IF WE NEED AN EMERGENCY BRAKE
THAN A BREAK SHOULD NOT BROOK THIRTEEN YEARS THAT IT'S FOREVER IN HER IN HER WORKING LIFE OF SOMEONE TO THIS SORT OF THING WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO EXCEPT BY EASTERN EUROPEAN SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES EILE MAR BROG THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN
MORNING WELCOME TO
THE LAST DIGIT OF YOUR TELEPHONE BANKING SECURITY NUMBER
CAN TAKE IT OF YOUR TELEGRAM YES ONE OF LIFE'S MANY IRRITANTS THE SHEER IMPOSSIBILITY OF REMEMBERING ALL THAT STUFF A MILLION DIFFERENT PASSWORDS AND BITS OF SILLY INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR MOTHER OR YOUR SECURITY NUMBER OR WHATEVER IT IS OR THE AGE OF YOUR FIRST PUPPY OR SOMETHING ANYWAY FROM NOW ON THINGS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT WHEN YOU RING YOUR BANK THEY WILL KNOW WHO YOU ARE BECAUSE THE COMPUTER WILL RECOGNISE YOUR VOICE REJOICE
UP TO A POINT PERHAPS DOCTOR EMILIANO DE CHRISTOPH IS THE SENIOR LECTURER IN CYBER SECURITY AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE ON GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HOW'S IT GOING TO WORK YOU RING UP AND THEY IMMEDIATELY KNOW WHO YOU ARE BECAUSE OF YOUR VOICE IS THAT IT
THERE'S GOING TO BE A ROYAL MEANT FACE WHERE THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE RING THEM UP AND DEEP RECORD YOUR VOICE AND THEY START
AND ESSENTIALLY RECORDING YOU'RE A BEHAVIOURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUR VOICE AND THEY CAN RECOGNISE YOU WHEN YOU CALL THEM BACK RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND IF YOU'VE GOT A COLD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT WON'T MATTER IF YOUR VOICE IS A BIT HORSE BECAUSE
RIGHT SO THERE THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOW ABLE TO COPE WITH DISTORTION IN BOYS DUE TO
AS YOU SAID ARE CALLED OR NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND BUT WE HAVE TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO GO IN PRACTICE
ARE YOU SOUND A BIT DUBIOUS NO I THINK THEY HAVE DONE THEIR RESEARCH THEY'VE DONE THEIR STUDIES SO I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IF THERE ARE COMPARABLE IN ROLLING OUT THIS TECHNOLOGY THERE
THEY'RE CONFIDENT AND THEN HE'S GOING TO WORK IN PRACTICE THEY DON'T WANT TO NECESSARILY HAVE A LOT OF CAST DEALING WITH PROBLEMS WITH CUSTOMERS NOT ABLE TO I'LL TEND TO KATE BUT YOU KNOW
THINGS CAN CHANGE QUICKLY IN THE REAL WORLD AND WHAT IF YOU'RE BRILLIANT MINI CAN YOU CAN
REPRODUCE HER VOICE VERY ACCURATELY I CAN IMAGINE SOME PEOPLE GETTING AWFULLY RUSH OUT OF THIS EYE I FOUND THAT QUITE UNLIKELY OLOGY IS IT'S ENTERED UNTIL DISCO ENOUGH ATTACKS AS SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THESE BANKS USE RECOGNISE UP TO ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT FEATURES OF YOUR VOICE AND ALSO YOUR PRONUNCIATION CERTAIN PHYSICAL
SO PHYSICAL FEATURES OF YOUR VOICE DOESN'T SOUND TOO TO SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT AT ALL BUT I SOUND LIKE SOMETHING YOU COULDN'T REPLICATE IT IF YOU WERE REALLY CLEVER AT DOING AGAIN TO COLLEGE HE ALLOWS YOU TO RECOGNISE WHERE THERE ARE VOICES BEEN
PLAYED OUT OF A SPEAKER SO IT'S BEEN PRETTY QUIET OF BOYS OR IT'S A LIVE ONE ALSO YOU KNOW THERE IS KIND OF AN EASY WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THESE ATTACK BY HAVING TO CUSTOMER REPEAT A SENTENCE INSTEAD IS UNPREDICTABLE BY THE USER
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECORDED AHEAD OF TIME
RIGHT AND WHAT ABOUT THE THUMBPRINT COS THAT'S THE NEXT STAGE ISN'T IT IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING ON YOUR SMARTPHONE YOU CAN JUST PRINT YES ALTHOUGH I KNEW I'D FIND THE TIME EQUIPPED WITH FINGERPRINT READER A DEVICE SO NOW A LOT OF MANX ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO LOGGING ON THEIR ONLINE BANKING ABS USING THEIR FINGERPRINT
GOOD JUST A SENTENCE AT THE END OF PASSWORDS WILD I THINK IT'S NOT WE'RE NOT THERE YET SO I THINK THESE BIOMETRIC BAYS THAT INDICATION WORK SINCE WORKING SPECIFIC APPLICATION THING IN SPECIFIC SCENARIO
BUT I THINK THEY'RE ONE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR CHRISTOPHER THANKS I THINK THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN WELL AS YOU COULD HEAR FROM THAT TECHNOLOGY IS CAPABLE OF DOING MANY THINGS IN FINANCE BUT IN SURE INCE TANYA BECKETT CAN TELL US WHETHER IT'S CRACK THAT MARKET YES IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE TO CRACK SARAH LARGELY BECAUSE OF REGULATION BUT ALSO THE NEED FOR A LARGE BALANCE SHEET YOU MIGHT THOUGH HAVE BOUGHT SOME INSURANCE WRITE A COMPARISON SITE
BUT IT HAS AS A SECTOR AS A WHOLE BEEN PRETTY SLOW TO FEEL THE IMPACT OF THE SO CALLED FIN TECH REVOLUTION IT'S STARTING TO CHANGE THEIR ROB MOFFITT AT THE VENTURE CAPITALIST BOLDEN CAPITAL IS STARTING TO INVEST IN INSURER FIN TECH COMPANIES IN A BIG WAY I WENT TO ASK HIM WHY
YOU HAVE INSURANCE WHICH IS THIS ENORMOUS INDUSTRY AND HAS BEEN BARELY TOUCHED BY TECHNOLOGY OVER THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS YOU HAVE FOUR TRILLION OF PREMIUMS GLOBALLY
THESE ARE THE BIGGEST TECH COMPANY IN EUROPE IF YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING AND INSURANCES MONEY SUPERMARKET WHICH IS WORTH ABOUT A BILLION
LOOK AT THAT EQUATION I COMPARE IT TO OTHER SECTORS SUCH AS RETAIL OR BANKING WHICH HAD BEEN COMPLETELY DISRUPTED BY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND I SEE SO THE MACRO THERE'S A BIG OPPORTUNITY THERE WHY DO YOU THINK IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET IT'S TOO BIG BARRIERS TO INSURERS TO BREAKING INTO INSURANCE
ONE IS BALANCE SHEET SAY IF YOU WANT TO START YOUR OWN INSURER YOU NEED TO HAVE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL SLUG OF CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO DIE SAY THAT OBVIOUSLY IS A BIG BARRIER TO A START UP COMPANY AND THE SECOND PIECE IS THE COMPLEXITY OF IT IT'S A VERY COMPLEX INDUSTRY TO UNDERSTAND THE REGULATION IS DEEP AND COMPLEX WE SAINT PUTS OFF THE TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEUR SEE HAS THE SMART PEOPLE THE INDUSTRY DOING QUITE INCREMENTAL THINGS HAVE TECH ENTREPRENEURS COMPUTER SCIENTISTS WHO JUST PUT OFF TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR IT AND WHAT ABOUT REGULATION
FASCINATING AREA HAVING THE F.C.A. OR TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE TO START UPS IN THE FINANCIAL AREA AND TRYING TO BE FLEXIBLE AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS A HUGE OVERLOAD ON THEM OF SO MANY PEOPLE TRYING DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS DIFFERENT WAYS OF OFFERING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THAT THAT LEADS TO A A LONG DELAY IN THEM BEING ABLE TO FORM A VIEW ON SOME OF THESE AREAS WHICH CAN BE SCARY HE'S AN INVESTOR BECAUSE TWO YEARS DOWN THE LINE
HE MIGHT DECIDE SOMETHING HE THOUGHT WAS FINE THAT HE'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO CLOSE THE LINE SO IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE VERY AWARE OF I THINK SORT OF COMPLIANCE AND REGULATION IS GOING TO BE A HUGE TREND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THERE WILL BE SOME THERE ARE SOME COMPANIES WHO ARE DOING QUITE WELL IN THAT AREA HELPING OTHER FIRMS MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND AT WHAT POINT ARE YOU INVESTING AND WHO DO YOU CHOOSE WHAT CRITERIA DO YOU USE TO PICK YOU INVEST
WE'RE IN EARLY STAGE INVESTOR WILL INVEST ANYTHING FROM SAY ONE MILLION TO TEN MILLION POUNDS SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A FOUNDER OR A SORT OF SMALL TEAM THE FOUNDERS HE REALLY IN THIS SECTOR THAT THEY HAVE SOME UNDERSTAND THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SUREST NEED TO UNDERSTAND FINANCE AND OR SOMEONE IN THEIR FOUNDING TEAM IT WAS A DEEP TECHNOLOGISTS EMILY UNDERSTANDS THAT SIDE AND THAT COMBINATION IS CRUCIAL THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING WE LOOK FOR THEN WE LOOKED FOR AN INTERESTING IDEA THAT IS INNOVATIVE AND WE LOOK FOR THE POTENTIAL
TO GROW THAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR ANY START UP BY DEFINITION IS HOW DO YOU GROW AND HOW DO YOU DE SAY WITHOUT SPENDING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON MARKETING SAY TRYING TO FIND INTERESTING GROWTH ENGINES IS REALLY WHAT WE LOOK FOR ROB MUFFET THEY'RE A PARTNER AT ALDERTON CAPITAL
THANKS TELL YEAH TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN JUST WHAT WE THOUGHT GIVE ELECTION COULDN'T GET ANY MORE SURPRISING THE POPE HAS BEEN IN A PUNCH UP WITH DONALD TRUMP HE SAYS HE ISN'T A CHRISTIAN BECAUSE MISTER TRUMP WANTS TO BUILD A WALL TO KEEP THE MEXICANS OUT MISTER TRUMP SAYS THAT'S A DISGRACEFUL THING FOR THE POPE TO SAY ALL THIS MATTERS BECAUSE THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF CATHOLICS IN AMERICA
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO WILLIAM GORLESTON WHO IS A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE BOOKINGS INSTITUTION HE WAS HIMSELF AN ADVISER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON ON RELIGIOUS MATTERS AMERICANS EXPECT THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CERTAINLY THEIR PRESIDENTS TO BE PEOPLE SAY IT'S ALTHOUGH IN GLIDE EISENHOWER'S IMMORTAL PHRASE THEY DON'T MUCH CARE WHAT THAT SAYS
BUT BEING AN ATHEIST IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S THE KISS OF DEATH CLINICALLY SO WHEN THE POPE SAYS TRUMP IS NOT A CHRISTIAN
POTENTIALLY COULD BE HUGELY DAMAGING AND YET MISTER TRUMP SEEMS YET AGAIN TO BE TURNING IT TO HIS ADVANTAGE SO FAR BE IT FOR ME TWO GEARS
THE PUB TACTICAL ADVICE BUT I THINK YOU COULD HAVE PHRASED HIS OBJECTION IN WAYS THAT WOULD HAVE RENDERED DRIP LESS VULNERABLE TO COUNTER ATTACK IF ONE THING TO SAY Z. SOMEONE'S BEHAVIOUR VIA PARTICULAR TENET OF CHRISTIANITY OR ANY OTHER CASE YET HE IS A BRIDGE FURTHER AND PERHAPS A BRIDGE TOO FAR
TO SAY THAT IRAQ PERSON HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT HE'S A PERSON THAT'S NO SIS WHATSOEVER I SUPPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ONCE MY TRUMP AS LEFT SOUTH CAROLINA AND THINGS HAVE GONE A LITTLE THE STORY WILL DIE BUT MAYBE THERE'LL BE A LITTLE REMNANT WOULD THOSE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS THAT
THE POPE SAID SOMETHING RATHER IMPORTANT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND IT MAY IN THE END COME BACK TO DAMAGE HIM DO YOU THINK OH ABSOLUTELY IN SOUTH CAROLINA THERE EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS FOR THE MOST PART A BLOODY END A BIG MID WESTERN STATES
YOU HAVE A GREATER THAN AVERAGE DENSITY OF CATHOLICS AND INTERESTINGLY MANY OF THE WORKING CLASS VOTERS
TO WHOM MISTER TRUMP AS APPEALED SO SUCCESSFULLY THUS FAR A CATHOLIC AND SO WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE GET MUCH FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD AND PERHAPS NOT UNTIL THE GENERAL ELECTION MISTER CRUMP IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOMINEE WHETHER HE HAD
ESCAPED WITHOUT DAMAGE IN THE WAY HE HAS THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS NO IT HAS TO BE SAID HE HAS A REMARKABLE ABILITY TO RISE OUT OF A RUIN AND BECOME THE PHOENIX IT EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY HE'S COMMITTED WHAT
OR BY NORMAL POLITICAL STAND UNITED STATES HANGING OFFENCES AND HE SLIPPED THE NOOSE EVERY TIME SO HE IS A VERY GOOD COUNTER PUNCHER THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT WHETHER
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT A COUNTER PUNCHER THRILLER AN EX PRESIDENT IS I THINK A MATTER OF CONJECTURE AND I RATHER SUSPECT NOT BUT I'VE BEEN WRONG SO OFTEN ABOUT HIM IN THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS THAT I'D BETTER NOT
GO TO FOR SAM TEMPTING TO SAY YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THAT WAS IT COLSTON THANK YOU NO I'M CERTAINLY THANK YOU SO MUCH THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND GARY RICHARDSON HAS IT HELLO GARY SERRA JOHN GOOD MORNING MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE NOW LOST ELEVEN TIMES THIS SEASON THEY WERE BEATEN TWO ONE BY EUROPA LEAGUE

A NEW TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETECT ALL INHERITED HEART CONDITIONS WHICH AFFECT MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.K. RESEARCHERS WHO RECEIVED FUNDS FROM THE BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION SO THE BLOOD TEST WILL BE QUICKER AND CHEAPER AND EXISTING EXAMINATIONS
TELEPHONE BANKING SECURITY SYSTEM WHICH RECOGNISES PEOPLE'S VOICES HAS BEEN SET UP BY H.S.B.C. THE BANK SAYS THE SYSTEM WILL MEAN THAT CUSTOMERS WON'T REQUIRE PASSWORDS AND FUTURE BARCLAYS WEALTH CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN USING A SIMILAR SERVICE FOR SOME TIME
A REPORT CLAIMS THAT A TWENTY PERCENT TAX ON SUGARY DRINKS COULD PREVENT NEARLY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.K. BECOMING OBESE OVER THE NEXT DECADE RESEARCH BY CANCER RESEARCH U.K. AND THE U.K. HEALTH FORUM ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE N.H.S. COULD SAVE TEN MILLION A YEAR BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE GOVERNMENT IS FACING PRESSURE TO INTRODUCE A SUGAR TAX BUT THE BODY THAT REPRESENTS SOFT DRINKS MANUFACTURERS SAYS THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT SUCH CHARGES HAVE AN EFFECT ON OBESITY
GOVERNMENT FILES FROM THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC TODAY REVEAL THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE POLL TAX ALARMED MARGARET THATCHER'S MINISTERS THE PAPER SHOW THAT ONE MINISTER WARNED THE THEN PRIME MINISTER THAT THE CONTROVERSIAL TAX COULD LEAD TO PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS TO AVOID THE CHARGE
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT IT WAS A LONG NIGHT FOR EVERYONE LAST NIGHT DAVID CAMERON'S FINAL MEETING BROKE UP AFTER FIVE O'CLOCK BRUSSELS TIME AND HE'S DUE BACK IN THE NEXT ONE WITHIN THE HOUR WELL WHILE WE WERE ALL WAITING FOR ANY NEWS TO EMERGE FROM THESE MEETINGS THERE WAS ONE PERSON DOING THE ROUNDS OF THE NEWS ORGANISATIONS LOOKING A BIT LIKE THE CAT THAT GOT THE CREAM NIGEL FARAI AS UKIP'S LEADER AND HE'S WITH ME IN A LITTLE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHEN I BUMPED INTO YOU LAST NIGHT
YOU WERE CLAIMING CREDIT FOR THE WHOLE SUMMIT I THINK WELL I LIKE TO THINK THAT BECAUSE OF YOU KIT WE'VE GOT THIS REFERENDUM PROMISE AND WE HAD THE NEGOTIATIONS LAST NIGHT BUT I THINK I'VE SEEN ALL THIS BEFORE I MEAN TEN YEARS AGO TONY BLAIR AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS WAS PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HE ATTEMPTED TO GET REFORM OF THE COME AGRICULTURAL POLICY HE FAILED AND YOU GAVE AWAY A CHUNK OF OUR REBATE AND WE KEEP DOING THIS GOVERNMENT AFTER GOVERNMENT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO REFORM THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE WORD REFORM IN BRITAIN
MEANS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT REFORM HERE MEANS PUSHING ON TO CLOSER ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNION SO I I JUST THINK YOU KNOW HE WILL BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO BE A DEAL OF SOME KIND BUT FRANKLY IT WE REALLY ARE SCRATCHING AT THE EDGES HERE THERE IS NO FUNDAMENTAL RENEGOTIATION
ON OFFER WHAT THAT IS I MEAN THAT IS ONE OF THE CRITICISM LOOK THIS IS ALL ABOUT THEATRE BUT SERIOUSLY GIVEN THAT YOU HAD TWENTY EIGHT LEADERS OF SIGNIFICANT COUNTRIES UP UNTIL VERY LATE SAYING NO THIS IS TOO MUCH YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT'S QUITE HARD TO SWALLOW THAT THIS IS MEANINGLESS
IT REALLY REINFORCES MY POINT THAT WE ASK FOR SOMETHING REPEATEDLY AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THAT IMAGINE IF WE ASK FOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE ABOUT IT WE'D ASKED FOR THE RIGHT OF PARLIAMENT TO VETO A EUROPEAN LAW THAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WE ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE
THIS EUROPEAN UNION IS HELLBENT ON FULL INTEGRATION AND IF WE STAY MEMBERS OF IT WILL BE DRAGGED IN ITS WAKE O. K. SO YOU HAVE SEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF THESE SUMMITS WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS COULD BE ONE OF YOUR LOST WHAT I'D LIKE TO THINK SO TO BE HONEST WITH YOU HAVING BEEN AT THIRTY ONE OF THEM
I SIMPLY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT AT SOME POINT TODAY MISTER CAMERON WILL NOT GET SOME CONCESSIONS OUT OF THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY MUST KNOW THAT HAVE CAMERAS SENT HOME TOTALLY HUMILIATED BREAKS IT HAS GOT THAT LITTLE BIT CLOSER OH K. AND
WHEN THAT REFERENDUM HAPPENS WHAT BECOMES THE POINT OF YOU
WELL OF COURSE THE BIG THING WILL BE THAT THE DANES VOTED AGAINST THE MAASTRICHT TREATY TWICE THE IRISH VOTED AGAINST EUROPEAN TREATIES AND ON THREE OCCASIONS THAT'S BEEN REVERSED BY GOVERNMENTS WHO WEREN'T PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE RESULT OF THE PEOPLE SO WE'RE NOT ON A SECOND WHATEVER THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM UKIP SURVIVE
WELL I THINK ACTUALLY IT WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY CARRIES OUT THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE AND IF WE VOTE TO STAY DOES UKIP STAY AROUND AND RATHER LIKE THE S.N.P. EXPECT TO PICK UP SUPPORT I THINK THAT THERE WILL BE PEOPLE CONSERVATIVE VOTERS AS LABOUR VOTERS WHO WILL BE IRRECONCILABLE TO THEIR LEADERSHIP'S AFTER THIS REFERENCE
NIGEL FARRAJ THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL ALSO WITH US IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS A EUROPE EDITOR CATCHER ADLER CATCHER GIVEN WHAT WE WERE HEARING AS A RESULT OF THESE VERY LONG MEETINGS VERY LATE MEETINGS AND GOING ON GOING ON FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME TODAY IS THE PRIME MINISTER IN TROUBLE
HE'S DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO FIND IT A BREEZY EASY AS HE THOUGHT AND I THINK PARTLY WHAT YOU PICK UP FROM THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS THAT FIRST OF ALL AS WE'VE SAID BEFORE THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN EUROPE THERE'S A MIGRANT CRISIS THIS HIS EUROZONE PROBLEMS PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT AN UNPREDICTABLE RUSSIA ON THEIR DOORSTEP IF YOU LIKE AND YET
ALL THESE LEADERS ARE SITTING HERE DEDICATING THIS TIME TO DAVID CAMERON HAD TO QUITE NARROW ISSUE THESE WORLD LEADERS ARE DEBATING TAX CREDITS FOR EXAMPLE SO EVERYBODY WANTS TO MOVE ON
ON THE OTHER HAND THEY DON'T WANT TO JUST GIVE DAVID CAMERON WHAT HE WANTS AND LET HIM WALK AWAY AND THINK THE PALPABLE RESENTMENT THAT YOU COULD FEEL FROM DELEGATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES WAS IT REALLY STRUCK ME YESTERDAY SO
DAVID CAMERON ARRIVES SHE SAYS I'M GOING TO BATTLE FOR BRITAIN BUT THERE WAS A SENSE ABOUT HIM THAT HE EXPECTED IT ALL TO SORT OF ROLL HIS WAY DESPITE THE WORDS AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE COUNTRIES IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE THEY FEEL STRONGER TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE A POINT TO PROVE THEY'RE NOT THE BRAND NEW MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ANY MORE THIS IS A VERY BIG ISSUE THIS IS A CHANCE FOR THEM
TO FLEX THEIR MUSCLES AND NOT TO GIVE A VERY BIG COUNTRY GREAT BRITAIN WHAT IT ONCE THEY'RE HOLDING BACK THEY DO I KNOW THEY ABSOLUTELY DON'T WANT TO BE BOSSED AROUND ON THE FRENCH THEY'RE JUST TOTALLY FRIENDLY AND BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE EDGES ON THE ON THE EASTERN EUROPEANS AND ON THIS QUESTION OF WHICHEVER BENEFITS OR WELL IN WORK BENEFITS GOING TO MIGRANTS AND ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY EVEN LATE LAST NIGHT WE WERE HEARING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT
CAMERON IS SAYING THAT THE DAVID CAMERON SAYING THAT BRITAIN ONCE WHICH IS THERE TO BE THIRTEEN YEARS TO HAVE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE IN PLACE AND WHAT THE EASTERN EUROPEANS ARE SAYING IS LOOK NO MORE THAN FIVE YEARS BUT ALSO I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WENT DOWN VERY WELL AS NEGOTIATING TECHNIQUE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER TO ARRIVE AT THE MEETING YESTERDAY AND SUDDENLY SAY THIRTEEN YEARS THAT WAS AN INCREASE ON WHAT WAS EXPECTED AND BY MOST PEOPLE IN THE ROOM SO YOU KNOW AGAIN
THERE IS A WHEEL TO GET THIS DEAL DONE AND THIS DOES NOT MEAN THERE WILL BE NO WELL DONE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE TWENTY EIGHT ALL SAT TOGETHER AND NOBODY WANTED TO BE SEEN TO BUDGE I THINK TODAY AFTER ALL OF THOSE BILATERAL MEETINGS THERE YOU WILL SEE MORE PROGRESS EFFECT IF THE DEAL'S NOT DONE TODAY MAYBE IT WILL BE DONE TOMORROW BUT IT WON'T BE AS EASY FOR THE PRIME MINISTER PERHAPS AS HE EXPECTED OR PERHAPS AS AS THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION EXPECTED
AND YOU SEE FROM BELGIUM AS WELL YOU KNOW THESE COUNTRIES THAT WORRY VERY MUCH ABOUT CONTAGION THEY DO NOT WANT THIS MESSAGE TO PAST THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND AGAIN WE MENTIONED THIS YESTERDAY EURO SCEPTICISM PEOPLE FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE EUROPEAN IN THIS IS NOT SOMETHING PECULIAR TO TO THE ISLANDS OF GREAT BRITAIN THIS YOU'RE SEEING
ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES IT USED TO BE VERY GRATEFUL EVEN FOR THEIR MEMBERSHIP LIKE ITALY FOR EXAMPLE AND IT JUST WE HAD A LINE FROM THE SPANISH TALKING ABOUT A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT COULD IT BE THAT WE DON'T SEE TREATY CHANGE
I MEAN ULTIMATELY I'M NOT CLEARLY NOT IN THE SHORT TERM BUT ARE EATEN IN THE CHEMIST HE MUST INSISTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS HAS GOT TO BE LEGALLY WATERTIGHT I SUPPOSE AT A CERTAIN POINT HE HAS TO DECIDE WHEN DOES HE NEED TO LEAVE WITH A DEAL AND JUST MOVE ON WITH ALL OF US HE WANTS TO CONCENTRATE NOW ON THE REFERENDUM AS WELL AS BILATERAL MEETINGS BETWEEN THE LEADERS AND THE GAIN PERSONAL CHEMISTRY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT AT THIS STAGE CAN THEY CONTROL EACH OTHER BUT DON'T FORGET BEHIND THE SCENES YOU HAVE TOP LEVEL
DIPLOMATS AND CIVIL SERVANTS WHO ARE WORKING ON THIS WORDING WILL SEE WHAT MAGIC THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SPEAKING TO A MEMBER OF THE CABINET AT TEN PAST EIGHT CATCH OUT THANKS VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS SEVEN EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS ARE NEVER HAS SO MUCH POLITICAL CAPITAL BEEN SPENT FOR SO LITTLE GAME THAT'S THE MIRROR'S VIEW OF WHAT IT DESCRIBES MISTER CAMERON'S MONTHS OF SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY HORSE TRADING AND HECTORING PAPER SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER COULD HAVE FOCUSED THIS TIME AND ENERGY ON WRITING MANY OF THE WRONGS THAT EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY INSTEAD OF WAGING A PHONEY WAR TO EXTRACT A SERIES OF DEMANDS THAT WE'RE NEVER GOING TO SATISFY THE OTHER SCEPTICS ANYWAY
SAYS MISTER CAMERON HAS PLACED A SERIES OF CAVALIER BETS WHILE THE WHEEL IS STILL SPINNING AND IS GAMBLING WITH HIS JOB THE TORY PARTY AND THE FUTURE OF THE U.K. THERE'S A LOVELY STORY IN THE TIMES THAT PETER RABBIT THE FLOPSY BUNNIES AND MISSUS TIPPLE MOUSE ASSISTED MISTER CAMERON IN HIS NEGOTIATIONS THE PAPER SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER DREW THE STING OF ONE OF HIS E. YOU RIVALS WITHOUT BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER CHARLES MICHELLE BY PRESENTING HIM WITH A SPECIAL SET OF BEATRIX POTTER BOOKS
IN FRENCH FOR HIS NEW BABY DAUGHTER THE PAPER QUOTES ARE BUILT IN OFFICIAL SAYING MY WHICH I WAS VERY MOVED AND EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT COMMENTING THAT IF YOU CAN LIST MISSUS TIGGY WINKLE AND SQUIRREL NUTKIN ON YOUR SIDE THEN WHY NOT IT'S THE SUPREME COURT'S RULING THAT THE LAW ON JOINT ENTERPRISES CALLED HAS BEEN MISINTERPRETED BY TRIAL JUDGES FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS GENERATES A LOT OF COMMENT AND SPECULATION
ABOUT ITS IMPLICATIONS THE MIRROR'S FRONT PAGE HAS A PICTURE OF DAVID NORRIS AND GARY DOBSON WHO WERE CONVICTED UNDER JOINT ENTERPRISE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE FOR THE MURDER IN SOUTH EAST LONDON OF STEPHEN LAWRENCE THE PEOPLE SAY THEY MAY NOW APPEAL THE INDEPENDENT SAYS A SUPREME COURT MADE THE RIGHT DECISION WHICH IS UNLIKELY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF NOISE AND DOBSON IT SAYS THE RULINGS NOT A LET OFF FOR CRIMINALS BUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE CASES TRIED ON ANY MORE NUANCED ACCURATE BASIS
THE PAPER SAYS IT UNDERMINED THE BRITISH JUSTICE SYSTEM TO HAND OUT PUNISHMENTS ON A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BASIS THE SUN SAYS IT CANNOT BACK ANY RULING THE GIVES WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS SOME OF BRITAIN'S VIOLINIST KILLERS A SNIFF OF FREEDOM IT WARNS OF A FLOOD OF SPURIOUS APPEALS FROM MURDERERS TRYING THEIR LUCK IN THE APPEAL COURT AND HE SAYS GANG MEMBERS WILL BE EMBOLDENED IF THE LAW IS WATERED DOWN
SEAN O'CONNOR'S DEPARTURE AS EDITOR OF THE ARCHERS HE'S LIKELY TO PROMPT MIXED REACTIONS ACCORDING TO GUARDIAN HE'S BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE RADIO FOUR SOAP FOR TWO AND A HALF CONTROVERSIAL YEARS AND LEAVES BEHIND A MUCH CHANGED AMBRIDGE RECENT ARCHERS PLOT LINES HAVE INCLUDED UNEXPECTED DEATHS AND EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIRS STORYLINES PERHAPS MORE REMINISCENT OF EASTENDERS WHERE O'CONNOR WILL RETURN AFTER AN ELEVEN YEAR GAP TO TAKE OVER HIS EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
IN THE SPRING AND NEWS THAT CRESCENT SHAPED CROISSANTS ARE NO LONGER TO BE SOLD BY TESCO ELICITS A STRONG RESPONSE WITH THE TELEGRAPH THE PAPER SAYS THE FINDING THAT CONSUMERS PREFER THE STRAIGHT KIND BECAUSE THEY'RE APPARENTLY EASIER TO SPREAD WITH JAM IS SHOCKING
THE WHOLE POINT OF CROISSANTS IT SAYS IS TO BE FOREIGN OR FACT PROVEN BY THEIR FAILURE TO GO WELL WITH OXFORD MARMALADE SAKE THEY MAY NOT BE SLICED IN TWO BUT BE TORN OR ELSE NATURE IS OUTRAGE FLOODS WILL AGAIN SWEEP THE LAND AND MORAINES STRIKE GARK APPLE OR WE COULD JUST STICK WITH TOAST
THAT IS AN OPTION OF COURSE BUT THEN WE'RE GOING UP TOAST AS WELL APPARENTLY BE REPORTED THAT YES TO THE END OF THE TIME IS NOW A QUARTER TO NINE AND HEARS A VOICE YOU'LL REMEMBER
THE COMMUNITY CHARGE WILL BE A VERY POPULAR
VERY POPULAR MARGARET THATCHER IN NINETEEN NINETY GETTING IT MASSIVELY WRONG THE COMMUNITY CHARGE KNOWN TO EVERYONE ELSE AS THE POLL TAX WAS MAYBE HER BIGGEST MISTAKE COULD MEAN NO A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT TURBULENT TIME BECAUSE THE NATIONAL ARCHIVE WAS JUST RELEASED THE MOST RECENT THATCHER MATERIAL LET'S GET SOME COMMENTS ON THAT FORM
WELL KNOWN DANCER ROCK ON TURN DOCUMENTARY MAKER JOHN SERGEANT WILL ALSO DID A BIT OF POLITICS IN FACT JOHN YOU WILL YOU REPORTED ON RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING OF HER LEADERSHIP OF THE TORY PARTY THAT'S RIGHT FIFTEEN YEARS I KNOW SURVIVED IT INTERESTING THIS POLL TAX THING ISN'T IT
IT IS COS WANTS CLEAR IS THAT THE WHAT THESE PAPERS SHOW IS THAT SHE WAS ENDLESSLY BEING WARNED BY MINISTERS THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A POLITICAL DISASTER AND EVEN NICHOLAS RIDLEY
SAID SHE WE THINK HE WAS THE ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY BUT SHE SHOULD RETHINK MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE CHARGE AND THE P.M. DISCOURAGE THIS FIRM
NOW RIDLEY WAS MEANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE THE LAST PEOPLE TO SUPPORT HER ON THIS HE HAD TO RESIGN BECAUSE HE WAS RUDE ABOUT THE GERMANS IF YOU UM OH YES IN THE SPECTATOR AT SAID AND SAID THAT THE GERMANS WERE TRYING TO TAKE OVER EUROPE AGAIN A VIEW SHE PROBABLY AGREED WITH BUT HE HAD TO RESIGN AND SHE WAS THEN WAS ISOLATED ON THE ISSUE AND EVENTUALLY OF COURSE THIS WAS THE ISSUE THERE
SO AFFECTED CONSERVATIVE M.P.S THEY THOUGHT LOOK THEY CAN'T WIN THE NEXT ELECTION WITH HER IN CHARGE SO THE POLL TAX DID FOR HER OR DIDN'T DO THESE PAPERS GIVE US ANY IDEA
AS TO WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE DONE NOW WHAT DAVID CAMERON IS DOING HE A HUGE DEBATE ABOUT THIS OBVIOUSLY FROM WORK IT'S INTERESTING THERE'S A COURSE ON WESTLAND WHICH IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT COMES UP IN THESE PAPERS WAS ALL ABOUT EUROPE AND MICHAEL HESELTINE SO MICHAEL HESELTINE AND EUROPEAN RIFT IS THERE BUT ONCE INTERESTING I WAS LOOKING THE OTHER DAY AT THE ADVICE SHE GAVE TONY BLAIR WHEN HE BECAME PRIME MINISTER AND SHE WAS VERY PLEASED TO INVITE NUMBER TEN TO GIVE HER ADVICE
AND IT'S NOT GO IN THERE WITH ALL GUNS BLAZING WHENEVER YOU GET TO A EUROPEAN SUMMIT JUST TELL JUST TELL THEM WHATEVER YOU THINK SHE SAID DON'T FIGHT ON GROUND YOU CANNOT WIN SO THIS IS PRACTICAL ADVICE
TO TONY BLAIR WHEN HE FIRST BECOMES PRIME MINISTER AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE EURO SCEPTICS OBVIOUSLY SHE'S GREAT HERO FOR THEM THAT SHE WOULD JUST JUST REFUSE THINGS ALL THE TIME SHE WAS VERY CAREFUL AND CAUTIOUS SUMMITS I KNOW I WAS THERE OR A FOLLOWED ALL OF THEM AND THE IDEA THAT SHE WOULD REJECT
THE SORT OF SUPPORT FROM THE UNITED STATES WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT FOR STAYING IN OR THAT SHE WOULD WANT TO PLEASE PUTIN REMEMBER SHE IS THE PRIME MINISTER THAT BROUGHT BRITAIN INTO THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM WITH JOHN MAYER IS HER CHANCELLOR
THE SORT OF ASSUMPTION THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS A EUROSCEPTIC WOULD ALWAYS HAVE FOUGHT ALL THESE ARGUMENTS RIGHT DOWN FOR WINE SHOULD NOW BE IN BRUSSELS SHOUTING NO NO NO THIS ACTUALLY SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE THAT WE DON'T KNOW BUT THAT ASSUMPTION IS SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT A QUESTION WITH REGARD TO OUR RECORD IN OFFICE NOT OUT OF OFFICE BECAUSE OUT OF OFFICE SHE OFTEN SAID THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WITH WITH GREAT TENACITY
BUT IN AN OFFICE SURROUNDED BY OFFICIALS SHE WAS USUALLY VERY CAREFUL AND MADE SURE OF THAT WHEN SHE JUMPED YOU KNEW WHERE SHE WAS AND THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE WE
I SUPPOSE AS A BIT OF AN EEJIT POLITICIAN AS A POLITICIAN WHO HAD VERY STRONG VIEWS AND CHALLENGED AHEAD REGARDLESS AND THAT'S NOT TRUE NO SHE'D LIKE TO GIVE THAT IMPRESSION BUT PEOPLE FORGET IT WAS GUARANTEED WHO TOOK HER ON AND I WAS PLAYS IT AS I STOOD UP TO GO OUT OR I STOOD UP TO ARTHUR SCARGILL'S CARGO WAS THE PERSON WHO INITIATED
THERE'S THE MINOR OF HE PICKED THE FIGHT HE PICKED THE FIGHT AND WHERE SHE WAS BRILLIANT WAS HE MARIE PLAYING THESE ISSUES THAT EVERYBODY KNEW THEM FALKLANDS THE MINERS' STRIKE EVERYTHING NO NO NO
ALL THESE WERE DRAMATIC STORIES WHERE SHE APPEARED TO TAKE A COMPLETELY CONSISTENT AND TOUGH LINE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT THAT WAS HER GENIUS THAT'S RIGHT SHE WAS JUST A GREAT POLITICIAN WHAT WOULD YOU PAY FOR A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THATCHER AND CAMERON THIS MORNING
YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
OH IT'S NOW SORRY FORGIVE ME IT'S ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING IS RABBI LORD SO IT'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TOMORROW IS THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD DAY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE WHICH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE ONE OF THE GREAT THINKERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY FRIEDERICH HIGHER TECH THOUGHT THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS SOCIAL JUSTICE
HE CALLED IT A MIRAGE A WILL OF THE WHISPER VACUOUS CONCEPT A HOLLOW INCANTATION A MARK OF SLOPPY THINKING AND INTELLECTUAL DISHONESTY HE THOUGHT THERE WAS JUSTICE FOR INDIVIDUALS THE KIND YOU GET FROM LAWS AND COURTS BUT FOR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE NO
THE HEBREW BIBLE THOUGH ARGUES OTHERWISE IT HAS TWO WORDS FOR JUSTICE CEDRIC AND MISH PUTT MISSED PUTT MEANS INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE BUT HEADACHE MEANS SOCIAL JUSTICE
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE BIBLE TO THE WORLD WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT WE'RE ALL EQUAL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD WE ALL BEAR HIS IMAGE WE'RE ALL CREATED IN HIS LIKENESS AND SOCIETY SHOULD IN SOME WAY REFLECT THIS NOT NECESSARILY IN TERMS OF WEALTH OR POWER BUT AT LEAST IN DIGNITY AND OPPORTUNITY
IT WAS PERHAPS THE FIRST ATTEMPT IN HISTORY TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE SOCIAL HIERARCHIES THAT APPEARED WITH THE BIRTH OF CITIES AND CIVILISATIONS AND IT'S BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO THE WEST FOR MANY CENTURIES
SO ARE WE GETTING THERE NOT YET THERE WAS AN ITEM IN YESTERDAY'S NEWS THAT PEOPLE FROM POORER BACKGROUNDS ARE STILL NOT GETTING TO THE BEST UNIVERSITIES IN ANYTHING LIKE PROPORTIONATE NUMBERS
IN RECENT YEARS SEVERAL LEADING AMERICAN THINKERS HAVE ARGUED WITH COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT SOCIAL MOBILITY IN THE UNITED STATES IS DECLINING TO THE POINT WHERE THE AMERICAN STORY IS NO LONGER TRUE THAT ANYONE CAN MAKE IT IF THEY WORK HARD ENOUGH THE AMERICAN DREAM THEY SAY IS BROKEN
AND IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE BECAUSE WE'RE STILL JUST AT THE START OF THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION ALREADY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS REACHED THE POINT WHERE MY PHONE IS SMARTER THAN I AM
AND IT'S GOING TO GO MUCH FURTHER MANY THINGS PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED TO DO WILL BE DONE IN FUTURE BY MACHINES EITHER THEY'LL BE MORE UNEMPLOYMENT OR WE'LL HAVE TO FIND WAYS OF SHARING WORK AND INCREASING LEISURE
INEQUALITIES ARE GROWING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HOW FAR WILL WE LET THIS GO
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER WE REALLY BELIEVE IN SOCIAL JUSTICE OR NOT PERHAPS LIFE IS JUST THE DARWINIAN STRUGGLE IN WHICH THE STRONG SURVIVE BUT I BELIEVE THE BIBLE TELLS US OTHERWISE
BUT THE GOOD SOCIETY IS ONE WHERE WE ALL HAVE THE CHANCE TO FLOURISH BECAUSE WE'RE ALL EQUALLY CHILDREN OF GOD
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH RABBI LORD SACKS IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED A PETITION CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO VACCINATE ALL CHILDREN AGAINST MENINGITIS B. AT THIS RATE IT'S GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST WEBSITE PETITION THERE'S EVER BEEN
AND THERE'S A PROBLEM NOT ENOUGH VACCINE TO GO AROUND THERE'S A SERIOUS SHORTAGE I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY SERRA WOOLSTON WHO WAS A G. P. IS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMONS HEALTH SELECT COMMITTEE AND ALSO BY SUE DAVEY WHO'S THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF MENINGITIS NOW CLEARLY YOU SUPPORT THIS PETITION TO DAILY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAPPEN
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THERE'S NOT MUCH VACCINE OUT THERE INDEED IN SOME CASES THEY'VE RUN OUT PRIVATE CLINICS HAVE RUN OUT ABOUT
ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY BRIEF I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE TERRIBLY LONG SO LET ME TURN TO DOCTOR WOOLSTON DO YOU AGREE WITH WHAT SUE DAVIES
CLEARLY THIS IS A TERRIBLE DISEASE BUT WE NEED THE DECISIONS ABOUT VACCINATION IN MY VIEW TO BE GUIDED BY THE EVIDENCE ABOUT WHY I WAS GOING TO BENEFIT HOW COST EFFECTIVE THE VACCINES ARE BECAUSE THERE'S WEE INTO AN AGE OF EVER MORE EXPENSIVE VACCINATIONS YOU HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WOULD YOU SAVE MORE CHILDREN'S LIVES IF YOU SPENT THAT MONEY ON SOMETHING ELSE WITHIN THE SYSTEM
THOSE KINDS OF DECISIONS I THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT THERE THAT WOULD DO WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE THE LIFETIME HOMES TO THOSE SURVIVORS OF THESE TERRIBLE DISEASES BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE EVIDENCE AND WE WEIGH THAT'S ALL IN THE ROUND AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE J.C.B. ALL RIGHT WHICH IS AN EXPERT COMMITTEE THAT ADVISES THE GOVERNMENT SO I THINK GOVERNMENTS DUTY IS TO FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE
BUT ALSO TO LISTEN TO A VERY MAJOR CONCERNED WELL THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT BECAUSE IN A DEMOCRACY YOU DO YOU HEAR THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO DO AND IF YOU'VE GOT VAST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SIGNING THIS PETITION AND THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE SILLY KNEEJERK IDIOT PREDICTIONS IS IT I MEAN THIS IS WHO MESSED ABOUT IT IS IT'S AN EXTREMELY SERIOUS CONDITION
BUT AS HER SEE IF WE WERE TO DRIVE VACCINATION POLICY ENTIRELY BY THE SIZE OF A PETITION THEN WE WOULD RUN OURSELVES INTO VERY DIFFICULT TERRITORY UNTIL OF COURSE THE WAY THE PUBLIC FEEL IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL AS PART OF THAT TRIANGLE OF HOW YOU WAY UP THESE DECISIONS BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE IN ITSELF THE MAIN DRIVER OF POLICY I DEPLOY THERE IS A CASE FOR
THE J.C.B. I SORT OF LOOKING AGAIN AT THE FORMULA IT USES TWO TO WEIGH UP AND COST EFFECTIVENESS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT SHOULD NOW HAPPENING AS A RESULT OF THIS PRODUCTION BUT THE SHORN LOOK AT THAT THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY IT COSTS WANTED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A DOSE AND ADMITTEDLY SOME CHILDREN NEED MORE THAN ONE DOSE BUT NONETHELESS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS THEY WOULD SAY FOR THE LIFE OF A CHILD REALLY WE QUESTIONED THAT
BUT THE POINT IS YOU NEED THREE DOSES OF THIS MINIMALIST IN THREE AND A FOOT ALL RIGHT WHO'S FOR A THREE HUNDRED FOR THE LIFE OF YOU KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE ISN'T IT IT IS A DIFFICULT ONE BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THERE ARE MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND BIRTHS A YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY HAS A SAFE AND IN INDIA IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE THERE WERE THIRTY THREE DEATHS FROM THIS TERRIBLE DISEASE AS WE HAVE A THIRTY THREE IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN TWELVE HARD BUT OF COURSE YOU ALSO HAVE TO WEIGH UP THE BURDEN OF
TERRIBLE DISABILITY THAT SOME SURVIVORS ARE LEFT WITH THAT SO YOU'RE I THINK WE NEED TO DO IS WEIGH THAT'S ALL IN THE ROUND BECAUSE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE MULTIPLYING THAT BOY HAS A SAY AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN A YEAR WHAT DO YOU ACHIEVE WHAT WOULD YOU ACHIEVE IF YOU SPENT THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY ON OTHER AREAS THAT ARE CAUSING DEATHS IN CHILDREN AND TERRIBLE DISABILITY AND SORT OF SAY THESE WERE REALLY IMPORTANT ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND WE DO NEED TO TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS IN THE ROUND
AND SEE THE THERE WOULD BE DANGEROUS IF WE WENT DOWN A ROUTE THAT SAID WE DECIDED VACCINATION POLICY ON HOW POPULAR IT WAS WITH THE PUBLIC YOU COULD RUN INTO ALL SORTS OF OTHER PROBLEM SO FOR EXAMPLE SOME PATIENT GROUPS AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS ONE I COMPETED BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT BUT THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF PATIENTS' GROUPS WHICH ARE FUNDED BY INDUSTRY AND SAID YOU COULD END UP WITH HAVING A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS IN A SENSE WAS ALWAYS BIASED BY INDUSTRY IN THAT REGARD SO THAT'S WHY I THINK
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS WE NEED TO STEP BACK WE NEED TO TAKE EXPERT ADVICE WE NEED TO CONSIDER HOW THE PUBLIC FEELS OF COURSE THAT'S IMPORTANT WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE LIFETIME IMPLICATIONS FOR SURVIVORS AND NOT JUST CONSIDER THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TRAGICALLY SORRY EVERY YEAR SO LONG ISSUE INDEED JUST GRIT FOR SO LONG AS THAT MONEY PEOPLE WILL SAY HE'S SPENT ON OTHER MEDICINES ANOTHER HELP THE CHILDREN AND NOT ON BUREAUCRACY
INDEED AND BUT BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A REAL CASE HERE FOR FOR ASKING THE JOSIE WII AND BODIES LIKE NICE TO TO MAYBE REVIEW THE THE WAITING MAY APPLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE LIFETIME IMPLICATIONS FOR CHILDREN WHO WERE AFFECTED AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE POINT THAT WE SHOULD DIP IT WITH THAT FISH SHOULD BE THE OUTCOME OF THIS PETITION DOT GO ON US AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR TORTOISE
THANK YOU THREE MINUTES IT'S NOW THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR A WEATHER FORECAST AND STABBED AND NURSE HOPE HAS IT STAFF THANK YOU SARAH GOOD MORNING TO YOU IT'S A VERY COLD FROSTY START FOR MANY AREAS SOME MIST AND FOG AROUND ALSO SOME ICE TO WATCH FOR OTHERWISE MANY CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE U.K. THE LOVELY BRIGHT MORNING WITH SOME WINTER SUNSHINE BEFORE

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON A FRIDAY THE NINETEENTH OF FEBRUARY THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING TALKS TO SECURE A DEAL ON BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL START AGAIN THIS MORNING AMID WARNINGS THAT MUCH WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE AUSTRIA HAS BEEN TOLD THAT IT IS BREAKING EUROPEAN UNION LAWS BY IMPOSING A CAP ON MIGRANTS A BLOOD TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETECT INHERITED HEART CONDITIONS AND THE DISCOVERY OF A WHEEL FROM THE BRONZE AGE HAVE SHED NEW LIGHT ON THE LIVES OF OUR ANCESTORS
TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS KATHY THEM DINING STREETS AS THERE HAS BEEN SOME PROGRESS UP THE SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS TOWARDS REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON REFORM IN BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. BUT WARNS THEY'RE STILL PLENTY TO DO
TALKS INVOLVING DAVID CAMERON AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AFTER MANY HOURS THE PRIME MINISTER LEFT WITHOUT MAKING ANY COMMENT HE'S DUE TO RETURN AT TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING HE'S WARNED OTHER E.U. LEADERS THAT UNLESS THEY HELP HIM DELIVER A CREDIBLE AGREEMENT HE'S PREPARED TO RETURN HOME WITHOUT A DEAL A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS IS FOLLOWING THE TALKS IN BRUSSELS
BILATERAL MEETINGS INVOLVING DAVID CAMERON AND OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS CAME TO AN INCONCLUSIVE END AFTER FIVE O'CLOCK THIS MORNING AND THEY WILL RESUME SHORTLY THE WORD IS THAT SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE BUT THEY'RE STILL A LOT TO DO
WHEN THE TWENTY EIGHT PRIME MINISTERS AND PRESIDENTS SAT DOWN LAST NIGHT IT QUICKLY BECAME APPARENT THE DIVISIONS ON THE PROPOSED DEAL FOR THE U.K. WERE DEEPER THAN EXPECTED THAT DOESN'T MEAN A DEAL WON'T BE DONE BUT ARGUMENTS COULD DRAG ON THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE NEXT FORMAL SUMMIT SESSION IS NOT DUE TO START UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON
MY CAMERON HAD TOLD HIS FELLOW LEADERS THAT THEY HAD A CHANCE TO SETTLE THE U.K.'S TROUBLED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. FOR A GENERATION DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO FESTER FOR TOO LONG
BUT HE ALSO FACED EFFORTS TO WATER DOWN SEVERAL OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES THERE ARE STILL DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT WELFARE BENEFITS FOR MIGRANT WORKERS ABOUT FINANCIAL REGULATION AND ABOUT THE U.K. DEMAND THAT SOME REFORMS HAVE TO BE BUILT INTO TREATY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE
THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD HIS COLLEAGUES HE WAS WILLING TO WALK AWAY IF THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM ENOUGH SUBSTANCE TO PRESENT TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE OTHER COUNTRIES KNOW THAT BUT HE MAY HAVE MISREAD THE MOOD ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE THEY TOO HAVE THEIR RED LINES
MISTER CAMERON'S DEMAND FOR EXAMPLE THAT AN EMERGENCY BRAKE ON IN WORK BENEFITS SHOULD BE IN PLACE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS CREATES PROBLEMS FROM POLAND TO PORTUGAL
MEANWHILE BELGIUM AND FRANCE ARE MAKING DEMANDS OF THEIR OWN PUSHING FOR LANGUAGE TO BE INSERTED INTO THE DOCUMENT TO EMPHASISE THAT THIS IS A FINAL TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT OFFER AND THAT REJECTING IT WOULD KILL OFF THE CHANCE OF ANY SECOND REFERENDUM IN THE U.K.
THE IRISH PRIME MINISTER AND HE CANNAE WANT IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REACH A DEAL THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL SAID THERE WAS A WILL TO HELP BRITAIN EVEN THOUGH OTHER COUNTRIES WEREN'T FINDING IT EASY TO AGREE TO DAVID CAMERON'S REQUESTS
GIVING HIS REACTION THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL FARRAJ TOLD US THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH DAVID CAMERON WAS ENCOUNTERING AT THE TALKS SHOWED WHY BRITAIN HAD TO LEAVE
WE ASK FOR SOMETHING REPEATEDLY AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THAT IMAGINE IF WE ASK FOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE ABOUT THAT WE'D ASKED FOR THE RIGHT OF PARLIAMENT TO VETO A EUROPEAN LAW THAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WE ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THIS EUROPEAN UNION IT IS HELLBENT ON FULL INTEGRATION AND IF WE STAY MEMBERS OF IT WILL BE DRAGGED IN ITS WAKE
E.U. LEADERS HAVE ALSO DISCUSSED THE MIGRATION CRISIS DONALD TUSK SAID A JOINT ACTION PLAN WITH TURKEY WAS A PRIORITY AND A MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE NEXT MONTH MY WAS SPEAKING AS A CUP ON THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS ALLOWED INTO AUSTRIA CAME INTO FORCE IS HE ASYLUM APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED AT ITS SOUTHERN BORDER EACH DAY AND THERE'S ALSO A RESTRICTION ON THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES WHO ARE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL THROUGH AUSTRIA TO NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS WARNED THAT THE MOVE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH E.U. LEGISLATION BETHANY BELL REPORTS FROM AUSTRIA'S BORDER WITH SLOVENIA OR TWO AND A HALF MILE FENCE NOW RUNS ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN AUSTRIA AND SLOVENIA HAD SPIEL FELT DESPITE THE FACT THAT BOTH COUNTRIES ARE IN EUROPE'S PASSPORT FREE SHAMANS
GROUPS OF MIGRANTS INCLUDING WOMEN AND SMALL CHILDREN QUEUE A BARRIER BEFORE THEY'RE SEARCHED QUESTIONED AND HAVE THEIR DOCUMENTS CHECKED MANY OF THEM WANT TO TRAVEL NORTH TO GERMANY BUT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN AUSTRIA
THE POLICE SAY THEY'LL SHUT THE BORDER IF MORE THAN EIGHTY PEOPLE CLAIM ASYLUM HERE IN A DAY OR IF MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED ONE TO TRANSIT THROUGH
THEY SAY THERE'S NUMBERS HAVEN'T BEEN REACHED YET BUT AUSTRIA'S LEADERS FEAR IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME UNLESS AN E.U. WIDE SOLUTION CAN BE AGREED
A NEW TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETECT INHERITED HEART CONDITIONS WHICH AFFECT MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.K. RESEARCHERS WHO RECEIVED FUNDS FROM THE BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION SO THE BLOOD TEST CAN IDENTIFY ALL KNOWN INHERITED GENETIC CONDITIONS AND THEY SAY IT WILL BE QUICKER AND CHEAPER THAN EXISTING EXAMINATIONS DOCTOR TESSA HUMPHREY A CONSULTANT AND MEDICAL GENETICS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THE TEST WAS PROVING BENEFICIAL IN CERTAIN CASES BUT WOULD NOT LEAD TO MA SCREENINGS
WE HAVE NOW BEEN ABLE TO DIAGNOSE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PUT THEM ON TREATMENT SO THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THESE CATASTROPHIC AFFECTS CARDIAC ARRESTS ALL IT HAD THE BEST SIMPLE FAINTS BUT THIS IS NOT FOR POPULATION SCREENING THE PROBLEM WITH WE'RE LOOKING AT GENETICS YOU PICK UP LOTS OF NOISE AND ACTUALLY DO WE WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT OURSELVES I'M NOT SURE WE REALLY DO
A NEW TELEPHONE BANKING SECURITY SYSTEM WHICH RECOGNISES A CUSTOMER'S VOICE WITHOUT NEEDING A PASSWORD IS BEING LAUNCHED BY H.S.B.C. THE BANK SAYS IT'S PLANNING THE BIGGEST WORLD OUT SO FAR OF VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN BRITISH BANKING HERE'S OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT ROLY KETTLE AND JONES
DOING ANYTHING WITH YOUR BANK ACCOUNT VIA THE TELEPHONE CAN BE A CUMBERSOME BUSINESS PLEASE ANCHOR YOUR BRANCH SORTING ENCODE OR SIXTEEN DIGIT CARD NUMBER BUT NOW SOMETHING CALLED VOICE BIOMETRICS COULD MAKE IT A LOT SIMPLER WHEN THEY ENROL IN THE SERVICE A B. C. CUSTOMERS WILL CHAT FOR A SHORT WHILE TO A CALL CENTRE AGENT WHILE THEIR VOICES ANALYSED THE NEXT TIME THEY CALL THEIR VOICE ALONE SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY THEM WITHOUT HAVING TO REMEMBER PASSWORDS AND OTHER DETAILS
BARCLAYS WEALTH CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN USING A SIMILAR SERVICE FOR SOME TIME AND THE BANK SAYS IT'S PROVED SO POPULAR THAT IT WILL BE ROLLED OUT TO ALL ACCOUNT HOLDERS SOON ACROSS THE BANKING INDUSTRY BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS WHICH PROMISES A CURE BUT SIMPLER ACCESS TO ACCOUNTS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY FASHIONABLE
OFFICIALS IN CALIFORNIA SAY ONE OF THE WORST GAS LEAKS AND AMERICAN HISTORY HAS FINALLY BEEN SEALED TONS OF METHANE SPEWED FROM A RUPTURED WELL FOR FOUR MONTHS DRIVING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES THE COMPANY THAT OPERATES THE WELL IS FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES WHICH IT DENYS
GOVERNMENT FILES FROM THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHICH HAD BEEN MADE PUBLIC TODAY REVEAL THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE POLL TAX ALARMED MARGARET THATCHER'S MINISTERS THE PAPERS REVEAL AT ONE MINISTER WARNED THE THEN PRIME MINISTER THAT THE CONTROVERSIAL TAX COULD LEAD TO PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS TO AVOID THE CHARGE JOHN SERGEANT WAS A B.B.C. POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AT THE TIME OF THE UNFOLDING TURMOIL
WHAT THESE PAPERS SHOW IS THAT SHE WAS ENDLESSLY BEING WARNED BY MINISTERS THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A POLITICAL DISASTER AND EVEN NICHOLAS RIDLEY
SAID SHE SHOULD RETHINK MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE CHARGE AND THE P.M. DISCOURAGE THIS FIRMLY AND EVENTUALLY OF COURSE THIS WAS THE ISSUE THAT SO AFFECTED CONSERVATIVE M.P.S THEY THOUGHT LOOK THEY CAN'T WIN THE NEXT ELECTION WITH HER IN CHARGE SO THE POLL TAX DID FOR HER
A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY IN AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN TOLD THAT THE THREAT OF POLLUTION FROM PLASTIC IN THE OCEANS HAS BECOME A CRITICAL PROBLEM RESEARCHERS ESTIMATE THAT AROUND EIGHT MILLION TONNES OF PLASTIC AND UP IN THE SEA EACH YEAR PHIL NASA REPORTS FROM SYDNEY
CONSERVATIONISTS SAY THAT POLLUTION HAS TURNED AUSTRALIA'S OCEANS INTO A PLASTIC SOUP THEY ESTIMATE THERE ARE THIRTY FIVE BILLION PIECES OF VISIBLE PLASTIC WASTE IN THE NATION'S WATERS THAT THREATEN PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE
PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATION HAS HEARD MICRA BEADS THAT ARE USED IN COSMETICS AND TOOTHPASTE OR BEING INGESTED BY FISH AND THEN IN TURN BY CONSUMERS OF SEAFOODS RESEARCHERS HAVE ARGUED THAT THE TINY BEADS ABSORB CHEMICAL TOXINS IN THE WATER A RECENT STUDY BY AUSTRALIA'S OFFICIAL SCIENCE AGENCY FOUND THAT ALMOST SIXTY PER CENT OF ALL SEA BIRD SPECIES THEY EXAMINED HAD PLASTIC IN THEIR STOMACHS
ARCHAEOLOGISTS IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE HAVE UNCOVERED THE MOST COMPLETE EXAMPLE OF A BRONZE AGE WE'LL EVER FIND IN BRITAIN EXPERTS SAY THE DISCOVERY SHOWS THE LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION OF OUR ANCESTORS JOE BLACK HAS BEEN TO THE SITE AT WHITTLE SEA NEAR PETERBOROUGH THE ANCIENT WOODEN WHEEL WHICH MEASURES ONE METRE IN DIAMETER IS THE LATEST FIND AT THE BRONZE AGE SITE IN THE CAMBRIDGESHIRE FENS
OR THEY FRAGILE IT'S WELL PRESERVED AND STILL CONTAINS PART OF ITS AXLE AND COULD INDICATE THAT THIS WETLAND COMMUNITY ALSO EXPLOITED THE DRY LAND FOR HUNTING IN FARMING
MARK KNIGHT THE LEAD ARCHAEOLOGIST ON SITE SAYS THERE WILL SHOWS HOW VERSATILE OUR PREHISTORIC ANCESTORS WERE THE RIVER MIGHT BE STAGNANT BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE VERY MOBILE AND I THINK THIS IDEA OF THEIR MOBILITY BEING REFLECTED IN THAT WILL SO WE CAN IMAGINE THAT'S ATTACHED TO A COURT AND WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT COURT IS TAKING THEM TO OTHER PARTS OF THIS LANDSCAPE THE WHEEL LIKE OTHER ARTEFACTS ON THE SITE WAS LOST TO THE ANCIENT WATERS AFTER A FIRE AT THE SETTLEMENT AROUND THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO
TIMBERS FROM WOOD IN ROUND HOUSES HAVE ALSO BEEN DISCOVERED ALONGSIDE TEXTILES JULES AND BOWLS WITH FOOD REMAINS LEFT INSIDE
JOE BLACK REPORTING AT THE TIME IS NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THERE WAS MEANT TO BE AN ENGLISH BREAKFAST THIS MORNING STARTING NOW WHEN ALL TWENTY EIGHT LEADERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD SETTLE THEIR FINAL DIFFERENCES WITH BRITAIN BUT IS THE MEETINGS LAST NIGHT WORE ON WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD BE BRANCH AND NOW HE'D SCHEDULED TO BE AN ENGLISH LUNCH
A LOT STILL REMAINS TO BE DONE THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK SAID WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON LEFT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL BUILDING AFTER FIVE THIS MORNING HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A DEAL BUT WE ARE TOLD THERE IS STILL A DETERMINATION TO GET IT SORTED AND WE'RE TOLD HE'S DUE BACK NOW FOR THE NEXT OF HIS MEETINGS THE DUTCH PRIME MINISTER MARK ROTA IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S BETTER FRIENDS IN EUROPE AND IN THE EARLY HOURS HE SAID BRITAIN AND EUROPE WOULD BOTH BE WORSE OFF IF THEY PARTED COMPANY
WE NEED EACH OTHER WE WANT HIM TO STAY FOR A LITTLE AS WE ARE AS A COUNTRY ARE VERY MUCH OUTWARD LOOKING FOR YOU MARK
SO IT'S VITAL TO HAVE IN THEIR EUROPEAN UNION IT COLIC BIG CROP YOUR KINGDOM ONE OF THE BIGGEST ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD TO BE PART OF THAT AND WILL SHARE THAT MARKET ORIENTATION SHOW IT WILL BE
USEFUL BUT ALSO FOR YOUR K. MY BELIEVE INSTEAD YOU'RE K. OUTSIDE YOU'LL BE UNION HOARD AND ARE BEING A MID SIZE ECONOMY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IS
SO I GUESS FOR BOTH OF US IT IS CRUCIAL THAT AT THE STINK
MARK RUTTER LAST NIGHT WELL AS THE HOURS PASSED OVERNIGHT NEWS TRICKLED OUT TO US JOURNALISTS THAT SEVERAL STICKING POINTS CONTINUED TO PREVENT A DEAL BEING DONE BUT THERE WERE OBJECTIONS TO WHAT BRINTON BRITAIN WANTED FROM THE FRENCH AND THE VISIT GRAD GROUP THAT'S THE CZECH REPUBLIC HUNGARY POLAND AND SLOVAKIA SO MIKE WENT TO SPEAK TO JOURNALISTS FROM THOSE COUNTRIES THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY CAUSING A PROBLEM FOR MISTER CAMERON TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEIR ISSUES WERE FIRST TOM MARSH BE ELECTRICALLY ONE FROM ONE OF POLAND'S MAIN DAILY NEWSPAPERS
THE MAIN ISSUE FOR THE POLISH GOVERNMENT AND ITS CHILD BENEFITS AND SO CALLED INVITATION ALF TAKE BENEFITS PAID BY THE U.K. GOVERNMENT POLISH CHILDREN AND SO ON
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO CALLED YOU OFFER US OR OUT WITH GRANT OUR ANTS WITH THE CURRENCY THERE WORKING AND LEAVING OUT
WENT TO SOUTH YOU WERE OFFENDED SOME U.K. THEY MADE YOUR GROUP IS GERMANY IT'S MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND
THAT'S WHY THE POISON THE SAMI TO AT THE BEGINNING WAS NARROWED HIS TAG BENEFIT INVITATION I DID THEY O.K.
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I THINK YOU MEAN IF IF IF BASICALLY THE U.K. CAN SAY LOOK WE'RE GOING TO PAY TARZAN I DON'T ANSWER THEN THE GERMANS WILL HAVE CALLED EVERYONE THE SAME YES AND THE DAY I THINK THAT'S
LOOK OUT GROBY IS GOING TO GIVE UP ON THESE ON THIS POINT I THINK IT'S AND BEAT THE ATTIC I THINK THAT THEY'VE COME I DON'T NEED THIS
FUCKED DORIS SWEAR HE LED TO THAT HE NEEDS EVERYBODY YOU NEED TO FIGHT YOU NEED TO HAVE A FIGHT HERE AND THEN WHAT BUT THE DEAL WILL BE DONE YES ANDRE HOSTS
YOU CHECK RADIO WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT WHAT THE DIFFICULTIES ARE IN STRIKING A DEAL FOR BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRIME MINISTER CAMERON WANTS TO INDEX OR CHILD BENEFITS WE WANT TO INDEX ONLY
BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE OR NEWLY BORN CHILDREN MIGHT LIKE OF DIRECT WE CAN LIVE WITH THAT THE CORE ISSUE IS TO ASSURE THE INDICATION IS ONLY FOR CHILD BENEFIT WHO ARE YOU HEARING IS BEING THIS SORT OF TRICKIEST CHARACTERS IN THE ROOM
DIFFICULT TO SAY BECAUSE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES SLIDE WITH COUNTRIES WITH THEIR OWN CURRENCY OR THE SUGAR OUT FOR SOCIAL BENEFITS OR EVEN BELGIAN VITE EVER CLOSE IT IN THE END OF IT WHICH FRANKLY WE CHECKS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND FOR US IS IS JUST A NON ISSUE
THE B.B.C. HELLO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A FRENCH JOURNALIST AND YOU ARE A FRENCH JOURNALIST WHAT'S YOUR NAME LUCAS LUCAS TO PUT
AND YOU WORK FOR CATHY ABOUT ENDS ON MY MAGAZINE ONE OF THINGS WE WERE HEARING IS THAT THE FRENCH ARE VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PROPOSAL FOR ITS PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WHO WERE OUTSIDE THE EUROZONE
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE ALSO HEARING THAT YOU DECIDE TO TAKE PART OF SOMETHING YOU DECIDE TAKE PART OF A GROUP OF MEMBER STATES IF YOU DON'T TAKE PART
YOU CANNOT DIE MANN'S THEME
AND IT WAS A FRENCH JOURNALIST TALKING TO BE END OF THE BAR MEANT LATE LAST NIGHT WE'RE JOINED FROM WESTMINSTER BY THE ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY AMBER RUDD GOOD MORNING TO YOU ARE GOOD MORNING ENERGY SECRETARY IF I NOTICED MA'AM APOLOGIES
HOW FAR APART ARE IS BRITAIN FROM ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES HERE CAN A DEAL BE DONE IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS I HAVE TO SAY I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID IS THAT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS BUT THE DEAL IS OUT OF REACH AT THE MOMENT I DON'T THINK WE CAN UNDERESTIMATE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET TWENTY SEVEN OTHER MEMBER STATES TO AGREE AND HE'S ALWAYS SAID THAT THIS IS ABOUT GETTING THE BEST DEAL FOR THEIR COUNTRY NOT A RUSHED TO DEAL SO
WHETHER WE'LL GET IT TODAY IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT IS A DEAL IT'S REALLY IN OUR COUNTRY'S INTEREST BUT CAN YOU REALLY SEE AND EVERY OTHER COUNTRY HERE WOULD KNOW THIS THE PRIME MINISTER'S GONNA WANT TO DEAL TODAY THERE'S MOMENTUM THESE GOT EVERYBODY IN THE SAME ROOM CAN YOU SERIOUSLY WALK AWAY WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING ON OFFER WELL HE CAN BUT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE GOING TO THERE IT'S WELL LET'S WAIT AND SEE THIS IS AN ONGOING NEGOTIATION I THINK THE KEY THING
REALLY DIFFICULT IMPORTANT NEGOTIATION IS NOT TO SET THAT SORT OF TIME LIMIT HER TO CONTINUE TO GET THE BEST DEAL FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND AS WE'VE HEARD FROM YOUR PIECE EARLIER THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT VIEWS SO IT'S A IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS WE'RE NOT THERE YET OH O.K. BUT LET'S LET'S LOOK AT WHERE COMPROMISES ARE BEING ASKED FOR A START ON CHILD BENEFIT AND ON THE IN WORK BENEFITS THE ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS FROM AND THIS IS FROM THE VISIT GRAD GROUPS THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO EXCEPT FOR A START THAT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE CAN LAST THIRTEEN YEARS WELL THAT'S CLEARLY BEING DISCUSSED AT THE MOMENT AND WE'VE HEARD FROM YOUR PIECE AND FROM OTHER COMMENTATORS THAT THERE MAY BE A FIGHT GOING ON BUT THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE I MEAN THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE HERE IS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE U.K. ISN'T A DRAW FOR MORE IMMIGRATION AND BENEFITS DON'T ENCOURAGE IT BUT HOW MANY YEARS DO YOU NEED TO PROVE THAT BECAUSE THE VISIT GRAB GROUP TO COME UP WITH
FIVE YEARS NOT THIRTEEN A BIG DIFFERENCE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND THAT NEGOTIATIONS GOING TO CONTINUE WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHERE IT LANDS THE DIFFICULT THING THERE IS THAT ANY WATERING DOWN
LEAVES YOU IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION WHEN SELLING THIS TO THE COUNTRY BECAUSE WHEN THE FIRST PROPOSALS CAME OUT THE REACTION NOT LEAST THE HEADLINES THE NEXT DAY WAS YOU'RE KIDDING THAT'S IT IF YOU WATER THAT DOWN HOW DO YOU THEN GO TO THE COUNTRY AND SAY THIS IS A GOOD DEAL I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO CONCLUDE THAT IT'S OF WATERING DOWN OF THE DEAL THAT WAS PROPOSED TWO WEEKS AGO AND I THINK THAT BECAUSE
IT ISN'T THERE WASN'T THE FINAL DEAL AND WE HAVEN'T YET GOT THE FINAL DEAL THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GO OUT AND SAY THIS IS WHY IT WORKS THIS IS WHITES IN THE U.K.'S INTEREST GOOD FOR US GOOD FOR OUR FAMILY'S GOOD FOR BUSINESSES I HOPE THAT WE WILL GET THE RIGHT REFORM DEAL I HOPE THAT WE'LL GET IT SOON WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE RUSHED TO GET THE RIGHT DEAL AND THEN WE CAN MAKE THE PITCH TO THE PEOPLE TO SAY THIS IS WHY IT WORKS WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT YET BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THE OFFER OF REFORMED PLACE IN THE E.U. TO TAKE TO THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN
AND WITH THE NEWS THAT BELGIUM AND FRANCE ARE PUSHING TO HAVE A LINE THAT SAYS LOOK THIS IS THE MAXIMUM THAT CAN EVER BE OFFERED TO BRITAIN NO RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS THIS IS IT ONCE YOU'VE SECURED WHATEVER IS SECURED TODAY DON'T COME BACK MOANING I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IS IT MAKES IT CRYSTAL CLEAR TO THE VOTERS OF THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE THE CHOICE OF COURSE IT'S ABOUT THEIR CHOICE WHEN WE HAVE THE REFERENDUM THAT THIS IS A ONE OFF
OPPORTUNITY TO STAY IN OR OUT BECAUSE SOMEONE'S I HEAR TALK ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING WE WILL HAVE ONE AND THEN WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER NO THIS IS IT HAVE A CLOSE LOOK HAVE A CLOSE THINK ABOUT WHAT'S IN YOUR INTEREST WHAT'S IN THE COUNTRY'S INTEREST AND THEN MAKE A DECISION SO I'M NOT WHOLLY AGAINST THAT BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S RESPONSES
THERE MUST BE SOME REGRET ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT WHAT THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS DONE TO BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE BECAUSE YOU CAN SENSE THE IRRITATION OF OTHER PEOPLE HERE BEING KEPT UP LATE AT NIGHT WHEN THEY ARE COMING FROM DISCUSSING A REFUGEE CRISIS TO TALKING ABOUT JOB AT CHILD BENEFIT IN BRITAIN WELL I DON'T SHARE THAT VIEW MY EXPERIENCE AND JUST GLOSSING WITH OTHER MINISTERS THROUGHOUT THE E.U. WHICH I'VE BEEN DOING IN MY PARTICULAR SECTOR IS THAT
OH K. SURE THESE ARE THE BRITISH EXCEPTIONAL ISN'T THAT APPROACHES ISN'T ALWAYS WELCOME BUT THERE WERE ELEMENTS OF THIS DEAL THIS PROPOSAL THAT ARE GOOD FOR THE WHOLE OF THE E.U. AS WELL AS BEING OFFERED U.K. PARTICULAR COMPETITIVENESS AND THEY WELCOMED THAT O.K. THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT IN TERMS OF PUTTING GREAT BRITAIN AT THE CENTRE OF SOME OTHER REQUEST BUT THERE WAS STUFF HERE THAT WORKS FOR THE Y. YOU AS WELL
AND ON THAT QUESTION OF MAKING IT WE HEAR THAT YES IT'S GOING TO BE LEGALLY BINDING BUT WE'RE ALSO HEARING THAT THERE MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE ANY TREATY REFORM
WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I MEAN THIS IS GOING TO BE LEGALLY BINDING IRREVERSIBLE INTERNATIONAL LAW DECISION IT'S A TREATY BETWEEN MEMBER STATES WILL BE DEPOSITED AT THE UN IT WILL THERE WILL IT LEAD TO EXISTING TREATIES BEING CHANGED IT WILL BE THEN MY EXPECTATION IS THAT IT WILL THEN BE INCORPORATED IN FUTURE TREATERS BUT BE IN NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING IRREVERSIBLE DECISION AMONGST MEMBER STATES
ONE THING IT'S HARD TO SEE A CABINET MEETING HAPPENING THIS AFTERNOON GIVEN THE TIMINGS ON THIS WE WILL WAIT AND SEE I MEAN THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DECISION IN THE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY SO MOST CABINET MINISTERS ARE GETTING ON WITH THEIR DAY GETTING ON WITH THEIR JOBS BUT ALSO WAITING TO SEE WHEN THE CABINET WILL BE CALLED BECAUSE WE'RE ALL WE ALL WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE UPDATE IS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING A DECISION AND THERE ARE OF COURSE SIGNIFICANT FIGURES IN THE CABINET WHO WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE UPDATE IS BECAUSE
IF WE IF IT'S TO BE BELIEVE THEY HAVEN'T YET DECIDED WHICH SIDE THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT ON DO YOU THINK WHATEVER WE GET TODAY BECAUSE WE KNOW IT NOT TO GO FURTHER THAN WHAT WE HAD BEFORE IT'S ENOUGH TO GET THE LIKES OF BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO
TO VOTE TO TIPPED UP CAMPAIGN TO STAY IN THE WELL INDIVIDUAL CABINET MEMBERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES BUT ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT EVERY CABINET MENACE MEMBER WANTS TO SEE A GOOD PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE EVEN THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO LEAN TOWARDS LEAVE THEY WANT TO SEE THAT THE OFFER TO STAY IS STILL A VERY IMPROVED ONE FROM WHAT WE HAD BEFORE SO EVERYBODY SPORTS THE PRIME MINISTER AND GETTING THIS DEAL BUT THEN INDIVIDUAL CABINET MEMBERS WILL HAVE TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE WON'T BE ANY WATERING DOWN FROM WHAT WE HAD BEFORE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE IN WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND I WAS WONDER THEN IF THERE IS ANY WATERING DOWN WHETHER IT IS A FAILURE I WOULD I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A FAILURE AT ALL BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE RUSHED BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE UNTIL DONE TODAY PROMISE IS GOING TO NEGOTIATE TO GET THE BEST DEAL FOR US ALL I THINK YOU'RE TOO QUICK TO DESCRIBE THIS AS WATERING DOWN THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS THAT ARE MOVING AROUND AND WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHERE THEY FINALLY LAND
BURRARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH ME IN THE STUDIO HERE LISTENING TO THAT IS A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA COONS BERG WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHERE BRITAIN FINDS ITSELF NOW IN THIS NEGOTIATION LISTENING TO AMBER RUDD VERY CAREFULLY THERE TRYING TO I THINK MANAGE EXPECTATIONS IT'S RATHER DIFFERENT TO THIS SENSE AROUND BRUSSELS THIS MORNING THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THERE WILL BE A DEAL
DAVID CAMERON IS ARRIVING AROUND ABOUT NO I BELIEVE FOR A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH ONE TO ONE INDIVIDUAL LEADERS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES BEFORE THEY ALL GET TOGETHER AGAIN FOR THAT ENGLISH LUNCH NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE BACON AND EGG BREAKFAST THEY WERE PROMISED LET'S FORGET SUMMITS HAVE DRAMA THEY HAVE THEATRICS BECAUSE POLITICIANS I WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK GOOD AT HOME THEY ALL WANT TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP AND SAY LOOK I STOOD UP FOR OUR INTERESTS AND THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT MOST POLITICIANS LIKE BETTER THAN SNATCHING VICTORY FROM THE JAWS OF DEFEAT
BUT ONE THING THAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT WHAT I'M AROUND WERE SAYING WHEN YOU WERE PRESSING HER ON WHAT WE'LL ACTUALLY GET WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE TIMING SHE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GO OUT AND SAY THIS IS A GOOD DEAL BECAUSE IT HAD JUST BEEN A DRAFT THEY HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO GO OUT AND SAY WELL IT ALL ADDS UP TO SOMETHING RATHER EFFECTIVE
THAT'S NOT THE CASE AFTER THE DRAFT DEAL DAVID CAMERON DID PRECISELY THAT HE WENT OFF ON A VISIT JUST LIKE SOMETHING IN A GENERAL ELECTION ON A FACTORY FLOOR YOU KNOW SLEEVES ROLLED UP AND STOOD UP AND SAID THESE ARE GOOD TERMS ON THESE TERMS WOULD I JOIN THE E. U. I SURE WOULD HE'S NAVIGATED HIMSELF
INTO THIS VERY DIFFICULT POSITION BY SAYING WHAT HE HAD ON PAPER IS A DRAFT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A WORSE ARE SIGNING UP TO AND WERE PROBABLY GOING TO GET WHICH WILL HAVE BEEN SO CLOSELY FOUGHT OVER IN PROBABLY WATERED DOWN IS NOT GOING TO LOOK AS THAT PUTS THEM IN A VERY TRICKY SPOT LET'S JUST TALK THROUGH THE CHOREOGRAPHY THOUGH BECAUSE I KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE CONTENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE TIMING THE TIMING IS IMPORTANT TOO BECAUSE OF WHAT HE'D ALLOW HOW IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CAMPAIGN INDEED
SO THE BIG PICTURE TIMING DEREK EMMA NEARLY HAD A SORT OF HAS TO GET THIS DONE EITHER THIS WEEK OR NEXT MORE OR LESS IF YOU WANTS TO HOLD A VOTE AT THE END OF JUNE WHICH HE VERY MUCH WANTS TO DO IN TERMS OF THE IMMEDIATE CHOREOGRAPHY HE'S HOPE IT IS THEIR HOPE WAS TO GET THIS DONE TODAY TO JET BACK TO DOWNING STREET TO COME OUT IN FRONT OF THEM
BLACK DOOR AFTER A CABINET SAY THAT HE WAS GOING TO HOLD THE VOTES AND THEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY GET TO CABINET MINISTERS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED OFFICIALLY TO COME OFF THE FENCE BUT IS ONE IMPORTANT THING HERE AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO AMBER RIGHT I THINK WHAT WE'VE HAD TODAY FROM HER IS A FLAVOUR OF THE DIFFICULTIES WHEN YOU GET HOME THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE DEFENDING A SMALLER AND SMALLER A PATCH OF TURF BECAUSE THERE WAS CRITICISM OF THAT DRAUGHT DEAL FOR BEING RATHER FEEBLE THE DEFENCE WAS IT'S A DRAFT
IN FACT OF COURSE WHAT THEY'VE BEEN SORT OF ROWING ABOUT MAKES THE DEAL LIGHTLY TO BE EVEN WORSE AND THAT IS CATNIP FOR THOSE WHO WILL BE CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE IT'S A FLIMSY A SPRINGBOARD FOR THE BEGINNING OF DAVID CAMERON'S VITAL CAMPAIGN NORTH KINSBERG THANKS VERY MUCH
TWENTY FIVE PAST EIGHT TWO YEARS AGO RICHARD BRANSON SPACESHIP THAT WAS MEANT TO TAKE TOURISTS INTO SPACE BLEW UP ON A TEST FLIGHT THE PILOT WAS KILLED HIS CO PILOT BADLY HURT SIR RICHARD SAID HE WASN'T GIVING UP AND TODAY'S UNVEILED A NEW VERSION OF THAT CRAFT
THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED HERE IN THE HARVEY A LOT OF THE TEAM WATCHING WHEN IT HAPPENED AND YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS A HORRENDOUS TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT EVERYBODY PICK THEMSELVES UP WE WE WE'VE ADDED A BIG HUG AND EVERYBODY EVER SINCE THAT THEY HAVE OR THEY HAVEN'T LOOKED BACK THEY'D LOOK FORWARD
WELL I'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE BY RICHARD BERGER WHO SIGNED UP TO BE ONE OF BRANSON'S FIRST SPACE TOURISTS AND ALSO BY DOCTOR PETER HOLLINS WITH A THIRD ACT OF THE AEROSPACE ENGINEERING UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER IT'S IF YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING RICHARD WHY WHY DID YOU WANT TO DO IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE ALWAYS
DREAMT OF DOING AS A AS A SCHOOLBOY WATCHING NEIL ARMSTRONG WALK ON THE MOON AND I WENT TO FLORIDA IN EIGHTY ONE UNTIL THE VERY FIRST SPACE SHUTTLE TAKEOFF COMPLETES BASIN AS IT WERE I'M NOT I WOULDN'T QUITE WELL YUP GOVERNMENT IS A LOVE OF MINE TO BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY GOING TO SPACE
WHAT DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING I NEVER REALLY DREAMED IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE HOW MUCH THE TICKET COST IF YOU HAVE TO BUY THEM IN DOLLARS AND AT THE TIME I WANT BOOK MIND TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WOW BUT THEN I ME TEN YEARS AGO I COULD HAVE BOUGHT MYSELF A REALLY NICE CAR AND NOW I JUST HAVE A TEN YEAR OLD CAR YOU COULD HAVE BOUGHT A VERY NICE OFFER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOT SAYS YES BUT I MEAN THE JOURNEY I'VE HAD IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THROUGH VIRGIN GLACTE IS BENT PHENOMENAL ANYWAY AND I DON'T
ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD CAN'T REALLY BUY EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE HAD SO FAR HOW DO YOU THINK WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN UP AND SPACIOUS HAVEN'T NO WE'VE HAD SO MANY OTHER EXPERIENCES ONLY TWO YEARS AGO I WENT TO PHILADELPHIA AND DID MY CENTRIFUGE TRAINING THAT THE TWO HUNDRED RAND COVERS ALL OF THAT WAS AN EXTRA THAT YOU GET OFFERED NO NO NO SO YOU GET A DISCOUNT BUT I MEAN IT WAS YOU KNOW WAS ONE OF THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT
YOU DON'T NORMALLY DO IN EVERYDAY LIFE YOU GO ON HOLIDAY FOR THAT THAT'S FOR SURE YES THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF OTHER STUFF HE COOKED FOR TWO HUNDRED BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT AT THE END YOU ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT ONE OBVIOUSLY SAY LEAVING PORT DO IT HAPPENING YES IT'S BENT YES IS THIS A LONG TIME COMING BUT IF WE HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TWO YEARS I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT WHATSOEVER RIGHT YOU WON'T BE COUNTING ALL THAT MONEY COS IT'S EVEN MORE NOW IN THERE
YEAH IT'S GOING I THINK IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS NO WELL AND I DID GET A BARGAIN BECAUSE THE EXCHANGE RATE WAS SO GOOD IN OUR FAVOUR THAT UP THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT PETER HOLLINGSWORTH WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT WELL IT'S INTERESTING I MEAN VIRGIN GALACTIC HAS MISSED ALL OF THEIR PROFFERED TO TIME LINES BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE AND MAYBE TWO YEARS HAD MAYBE THREE OR FOUR BUT I THINK THEY'LL HAVE A VIABLE PRODUCT THOUGH ACTUALLY START TAKING PEOPLE ON THE SPACEMEN THAT TOO DISTANT FUTURE
BUT AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED IT'S MORE ABOUT IN TAKE THIS ISN'T ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IT'S ABOUT SOCIETY HAVE BEEN CHANGED AS IT WERE WELL THERE'S A BIT OF TECHNOLOGY BUT THE FACTOR MATTERS WHAT THERE THEY'RE DOING MY SPACESHIP TO AND THE LIGHT GIVES THEY'RE DOING STUFF THAT WE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DID IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SO THE TECHNOLOGY AS AN ADVANCED BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AS EVERYTHING ELSE IS CUT UP SO PEOPLE ACQUITTED THEY CAN THEY CAN NOW AFFORD THAT WERE BEFORE IT WAS JUST GOVERNMENTS THAT CAN AFFORD THAT KIND OF THING
WELL YES HE CAN AFFORD IT BUT WHAT'S REMARKABLE IS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE LIKE LIKE RICHARD HERE RICHARD BURTON NOT RANSOM HE HE CAN AFFORD TO JUST ALWAYS PREPARED TO AFFORD TO GO OFF AND DO IT WELL IT DAD SHOWS YOU JUST HOW MUCH WEALTHIER WE ARE AS A SOCIETY WHERE WE WERE IN THE SIXTIES
AND WHERE DOES IT GO I NEED THAT BECAUSE WELL BOTH LITERALLY AND METAPHORICALLY WAS WERE THERE IT GOES INTO SPACE BUT SORT OF ONLY JUST AS IT WERE YEAH SO IT GOES JUST ABOVE THAT WHAT'S CALLED THE VAN COME IN MINE WHICH IS JUST KIND OF A SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION OF WHERE SPACE STARTS EM IN THEY DO A SUB ORBITAL FLIGHT NEW EXPERIENCE WEIGHTLESSNESS WHICH IS WHAT THEIR U. S. X. FIFTEEN PROGRAMME DID BACK IN THE SIXTIES THIS IS AN ORBITAL SPACECRAFT LIKE SPACE SHUTTLE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
SO WHY HAVEN'T GOVERNMENT DONE IT WOULD BE A WAY OF RAISING A BIT OF CASH WOULDN'T IT WELL IN A SENSE THE RUSSIANS HAVE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THEY'VE THEY'VE PARTNERED UP WITH A PRIVATE ORGANISATION AND SELL TRIPS INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION NOW THEN UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND KNOWLEDGE THERE
THINK THIRTY OR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS JUST TOLD YOU HOW MUCH HARDER IT IS TO GO AND OR A BIT ORBIT THEN JUST DO A SUBORDINATE OFF RIGHT I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT'S A BIT BEYOND YOUR BUDGET IS IT RICHARD THE THIRTY THAT WOULD BE STRETCHING IT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SELL THEIR HOUSE TO DO THAT AS EVERYBODY ELSE'S WELL QUITE WHEN DO YOU THINK WHEN DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE NOT ROUTINE I SUPPOSE REBEL BE ROUTINE IN OUR LIFETIMES BUT HOPEFULLY FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS
IT IS IN A SENSE FOR SOME OF THE STUFF IT'S ALREADY FAIRLY ROUTINE SO USE ARCHES IN LIKE A ROUTINE BUT FOR THINGS LIKE VIRGIN GALACTIC SCORE BLUE AND TOURISM IN THAT SENSE IT'S PROBABLY IT'LL BE LIKE SKYDIVING IT'LL BE ROUTINE BUT IT WON'T BE EVERYBODY DOING IT AND THAT'LL PROBABLY TEN YEARS NOW AS WHEN I'M GUESSING

BEN SAUNDERS MY CASTAWAY DO JOIN US TO HEAR HIS DESERT ISLAND DISCS THIS MORNING AT NINE
THE WEATHER IT'S TURNING MILD HOW THAT WILL BE WET IN THE SOUTH YOU KNEW THAT WAS COMING DIDN'T YOU WINTERY FURTHER NORTH YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS IN LONDON AND SARAH MONTAGUE IN BRUSSELS LET'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS NOW AT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINE FROM KATHY CLARKSTON DOWNING STREET THERE'S BEEN SOME PROGRESS DURING MARATHON TALKS IN BRUSSELS ON REFORM IN BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT IT WARNS THERE'S STILL PLENTY TO DO TO REACH A DEAL AFTER A BRICK DAVID CAMERON IS CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS THIS MORNING
THE ENERGY SECRETARY AMBER RUDD HAS TOLD US THAT IT WAS TOO EARLY TO SAY IF AN AGREEMENT COULD BE ACHIEVED IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS OR EVEN TODAY BUT SHE INSISTED THAT NEGOTIATION SHOULDN'T BE RUSHED AS MISTER CAMERON CONTINUE TO TRY TO GET THE BEST DEAL FOR THE U.K. AUSTRIA HAS IMPLEMENTED A CUP ON ASYLUM SEEKERS DESPITE BEING WARNED THAT THE MOVE IS IN BREACH OF E.U. LAW IS ASYLUM APPLICATIONS A DAY WILL BE ACCEPTED AT AUSTRIA SOUTHERN BORDER
A NEW TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETECT ALL INHERITED HEART CONDITIONS WHICH AFFECT MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.K. RESEARCHERS SAY THE BLOOD TEST WILL BE QUICKER AND CHEAPER THAN EXISTING EXAMINATIONS H.S.B.C. HAS SET UP A TELEPHONE BANKING SECURITY SYSTEM WHICH RECOGNISES PEOPLE'S VOICES THE BANK SAYS THE SYSTEM WILL MEAN THAT IN THE FUTURE CUSTOMERS WON'T REQUIRE PASSWORDS
IT IS NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO NINE THE LONG DEBATE OVER WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE A NEW TAX ON SUGARY DRINKS HAS GIVEN NEW LIFE TODAY THERE'S A REPORT OUT FROM CANCER RESEARCH U.K. U.K. HEALTH FORUM THE CALCULATOR TAX OF TWENTY PER CENT COULD CUT OBESITY RATES BY FIVE PER CENT IN TEN YEARS AND SAY THE N.H.S. ABOUT TEN MILLION IN HEALTH CARE I'M JOINED BY ALISON COX OF CANCER RESEARCH AND TIM WRIGHT CRAFT OF THE FOOD AND DRINK FEDERATION GOT TO BE A BIT OF A GUESS THIS HASN'T IT DOES
I NO THIS IS BASED ON MODELLING ON EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE ABOUT PRICES CONSUMPTION AND HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO CHANGING CRISIS AND WE TAKEN THAT INFORMATION AND BUILT A MODEL BUT THEN APPLIES THE REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION TO THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN TERMS OF CALORIES CONSUMED AND THEN WEIGHT GAIN SOME PEOPLE SAY IT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK PUTTING A FEW EXTRA PENCE ON A FIZZY DRINK DOESN'T WORK
THERE'S CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE THAT THIS KIND OF TAX DOES WORK IT'S WORKED IN MEXICO WHERE A SIMILAR TAX HAS LED TO A TWELVE PERCENT REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION AND THERE'S WIDER EVIDENCE AROUND THESE KINDS OF TAXES ON FOOD INCLUDING FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION THAT LOOKED ACROSS THE BOARD AT LEAST HER KINDS ATTACKS AS IT DOES IN FACT LEAD TO WATCH I THINK I'LL JUST PILE THE PRESSURE ON THE MANUFACTURERS TO CUT THE SUGAR
WE'D LIKE TO SEE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO TO OBESITY AND PARTICULARLY CHILDREN SABI CITY THE GOVERNMENT JEREMY HUNT HIMSELF HAS CALLED A NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND THEN SAID HE WANTS TO TAKE GAME CHANGING ACTION SO YES WE WANT TO SEE THE COMPANIES DO WHAT THEY CAN TO REDUCE SUGAR AROUND IN FOOD SO THEY DO IT
WE'D LIKE TO SEE THEM DO MORE AND I UNDERSTAND YOU ENOUGH THEY COULD DO MORE SO THEY'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH YES I WOULD SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO MAKE A GREAT DEAL MORE PROGRESS IF WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE IS A NATIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCY WHAT TIM MYCROFT FIRST ATTACKS WOULD IT WORK NO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD JOHN I THINK THE INTERESTINGLY THE EVIDENCE FROM MEXICO WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY PLACE WHERE IT HAS BEEN TRIED IS THAT REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION WAS SIX PER CENT OVER THE YEAR PROFESSOR TOM SANDERS DESCRIBED AS UNDERWHELMING AND VERY MODEST GAINS
IT'S ALSO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT WE WOULD SINGLE OUT SUGAR WHEN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE EXCESS CALORIES FROM OLD NUTRIENTS SO WHY WOULD YOU JUST PICK ON SUGAR COS IT'S EASY EM BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SUGAR IN A BOTTLE OF COKE WHAT A CAN OF COKE THE DID THAT MAKES KIDS FAT I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES A GOOD POLICY MAKING I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE THE EVIDENCE IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK OF A CHILD IS DRINKING
CAN OF COKE A DAY OR MAYBE MORE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET FAT ON AS A RESULT OF IT OR AT LEAST IT BUT WILL NOT ENCOURAGED OBESITY
I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO TACKLE CHILDREN'S DIETS OVERALL WE NEED TO PLAY OUR PART AS ALISON ARE SAID BY CONTINUING TO TAKE FAT SALT AND SUGAR OUT OF THAT THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH OF IT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DOING THAT WE'VE TAKEN MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF CALORIES OUT OF SOFT DRINKS OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS FOUR YEARS TEN OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS TWENTY PER CENT WE'VE COMMITTED TO SO THERE IS A HUGE COMMITMENT BY THE INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE ON THAT BRIEFLY NARRATION JOURNEY BUT I MEAN IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD CUT THE AMOUNT OF THEY NOT YOU BUT THE MANUFACTURERS COULD
CUT THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IN SAY A CALICO GOING TO BE CATEGORY TALK AT ALL SORTS OF OTHER SOFT DRINKS OBVIOUSLY BUT NEXT WEEK I MEAN WHY CAN'T THEY STOP IN THEM THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THEY'RE REGULATED BY THE TOUGHEST REGULATOR OF ALL WHICH IS THE CONSUMER CONSUMERS WON'T BUY PRODUCTS THEY DON'T LIKE IT SO YOU HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS GRADUALLY WELL THEY ALL DID IT THE CONSUMER WOULD WOULDN'T THEY AND THEY HAD THE IDEA THAT KIDS WOULD STOP DRINKING A DRINK THEY BRUNG FOR HEAVEN'S
BECAUSE IT'S A BIT LESS WHEAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T PROVE IT WITH THE OTHER THING OF COURSE IS THAT IF YOU TAKE AWAY ONE SOURCE OF CALORIES WHAT HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN IS THAT CONSUMERS FIND THEIR CALORIES ELSEWHERE ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS IN CANCER RESEARCH U.K.'S MODELLING IS THAT THE SUBSTITUTION OF CALORIES WOULD BE QUITE SMALL I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THAT I WAS A GIRL
THAT'S RIGHT YOU HAVE TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS IN MODELLING BUT CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT IF YOU WERE TO AT A POPULATION LEVEL TAKE OUTS LEVEL OF REDUCTION CONSUMPTION OF SOFT DRINKS WE SUGGEST IN THIS REPORT YOU WOULD SEE OVERALL A REDUCTION IN CALORIE INTAKE THAT'S TRUE THERE WOULD BE SOME REPLACEMENT BUT WE NEED TO TAKE MEASURES LIKE THIS IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO TACKLE WHAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM
SO WHAT WHAT IT WAS WET WHEN WE STRIKE OF SAYS THAT THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF IT YOU HEARD WHAT HE HAD TO SAY SO NOBODY REPEATING THAT WHEN HE SAYS THAT THAT THAT WILL SOUND MANY PEOPLE THOUGH THEY ARE MAKING AN EFFORT THEREFORE NO NEED TO PUT A TAX ON THEM
WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE IN TERMS OF THIS RE FORMULATION OF FOODS IS SETTING A CLEAR TARGETS AND THEN ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM HOWDY SETTING TARGA I'M WELL ALSO BORED BY LAW WE WOULDN'T RULE THAT OUT BUT AT THIS STAGE I THINK WE COULD SET UP IT'S CLEAR TARGETS WHICH THEY'RE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO AND THERE'S A TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR MEASURING THEM AND WE WOULDN'T RULE OUT LEGISLATION AT A LATER DATE BUT WE'D LIKE TO SEE THIS SYSTEM WORK FIRST
MY CROFT THIS IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC QUESTION BUT ISN'T IT PREPOSTEROUS TH THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE DRINKING CANS OF DRINK THAT HAVE A DOZEN
TEASPOONFULS OF SUGAR IN THEM OR THE EQUIVALENT THERE OR NO I DON'T THINK IT'S PREPOSTEROUS I THINK REALLY I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT ALL SORTS OF MY DAUGHTER WE'LL DRINK CANS OF COKE OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE ALSO THE FOOD'S AND DRINK OUT THERE THAT CONTAIN SUGAR WE ALL WE ALL NEED YOU SPOONFULS IN ONE CAN SO BRIDGES NOT ALL THESE PRODUCTS JOHN HAVE A LABEL ON THE FRONT THERE SAYS EXACTLY HOW MUCH SUGAR IS IN THERE
AS CONSUMERS WE CAN MAKE A CHOICE WE CAN SAY CHILDREN I WANT TO TREAT CHILDREN CAN'T THEIR PARENTS OF COURSE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES AND THAT'S WHY ALISTAIR'S RIGHT WE NEED A HOLISTIC STRATEGY TO TACKLE CHILDHOOD OBESITY CAUSE IT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT MY INDUSTRY DOES ALTHOUGH THAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S ABOUT WHAT PARENTS DO IT'S ABOUT WHAT SCHOOLS DO IT'S ABOUT THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IT'S ABOUT LABELLING OF THE WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS
THERE ARE UNFORTUNATELY JENRO GRAF DOES AND COX THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH BUT I'M NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE IN THE U.K. ON AVERAGE ONE FARMER KILLS HIMSELF EACH WEEK MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT OF FARMERS EXPERIENCE CLINICAL DEPRESSION AS PART OF THE B.B.C.'S MENTAL HEALTH WEEK OUR ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT CLAIRE MARSHALL TAKES A LOOK AT THE DIFFICULTIES SOME FARMERS FACE
WONDERFUL MORNING HERE IN THE WILTSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE BRIGHT SUN ON THE STUBBLY THRILLED BUT THERE IS A SOMBRE SIDE TO THIS I CAN SEE FOR MILES AND JUST MAKE OUT SOME HOUSES BUT I CERTAINLY CAN'T SEE ANOTHER PERSON
AND FARMING SUPPORT GROUPS SAY THAT THIS ISOLATION IS ONE REASON THAT IT'S A PROFESSION WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST SUICIDE RATES IN THE U.K.
WE SPOKE TO A TRACTOR DRIVER IN HIS TWENTIES WHO SAYS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HE GOT CLOSE TO TAKING HIS LIFE HIS FAMILY STILL DON'T KNOW HOW BAD IT GOT THIS IS AN ACTOR'S VOICE
I CAN SPEND ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY SAT HERE ON MY OWN
THE ONLY REAL COMMUNICATION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS THE RADIO TO LISTEN TO ALL THE MOBILE PHONE TO SPEAK TO SOMEBODY I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF HOURS ON MY OWN NOT EATING PROPERLY AT SENSIBLE TIMES YOU CAN BECOME VERY ANGRY AT THE SMALLEST LITTLE THING
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG OR SOMEONE SAYS SOMETHING VERY SILLY YOU'RE VERY SMALL CAN SUE MAKE YOU VERY ANGRY AND UPSET
THERE ARE OTHER PRESSURES AT THE MOMENT ON FARMERS MY FOOT
JUST BY THIS DAIRY FARM AND THE CRASH AND LOOK PRICES HE'S HIT THEM HARD
THEN THERE'S THE DAMAGE DONE BY FLOODING AND THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF DELAYS IN SUBSIDY PAYMENTS ALISON TWIGGY FROM THE RURAL SUPPORT NETWORK IN LINCOLNSHIRE
THIS DEEP PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO PRESENT WHO WAS A SUFFERING SOME KIND OF MENTAL ILL HEALTH WITH FARMERS THE FARM AND THE BUSINESS AND THE HOME AND THE FAMILY ARE INEXTRICABLY MIXED UP AND THEY CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT
I FELT IN A VERY LOW PLACE HAD A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT TIMES AT THE TIME I DIDN'T FEEL A VALUE TO MYSELF OR MY FAMILY OR TO MY FRIENDS IT JUST IT JUST FELT THAT I WAS BASICALLY GET NO
I'M GOING TO WORK AND SITTING ON THE TRACTOR ON MY OWN IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD
I MIGHT ONLY SPEAK TO ONE PERSON IN A DAY WHEN SHE START DOING UP FOR A WEEK OR A MONTH YOU GET VERY ISOLATED AND VERY LOW SELF CONFIDENCE
CLAIRE WARDEN THE SET UP RURAL PLUS IT'S A CAMPAIGN TO HELP YOUNG FARMERS COPING WITH THE DIFFICULTIES OF ISOLATION SHE BELIEVES MORE SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE PROBLEMS ARISE FOR EXAMPLE AT AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I'D BEEN AFFECTED WITH MENTAL HEALTH IN RESPECT OF MY FATHER WHO MADE AN ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE AFTER WE LOST THE FARM DUE TO FOOT AND MOUTH WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS AN ORGANISATION LOOKING AT PREPARING YOUNG PEOPLE ACTUALLY MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF WHO IS OUT THAT WHAT IS OUT THERE WHAT THEY MAY COME ACROSS WHAT THEY MIGHT SEE WHEN THEY'RE WORKING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE SAY THAT THEY KNOW WHERE THEY CAN GO IF THEY EVER COME ACROSS SOMETHING LATER ON IN LIFE
IT'S NOT THE EASIEST OF SUBJECTS TO SPEAK ABOUT BUT IT'S ONE THAT I FEEL NEEDS TO BE SPOKEN ABOUT IF SPEAKING ABOUT IT HELPS ONE PERSON THAT I'VE ACHIEVED SOMETHING
JUST COMING TO THE END OF MY WALK HERE IN THE SKIES CLOSE DOON IT'S GREY AND IT'S DRIZZLING AND IT'S CLEAR TO SEE WHY EVEN THOUGH FARMERS SEEM SO TOUGH AND RESILIENT THEY CAN FACE THE SAME MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS SO MANY OTHERS
CLAIRE MARSHALL REPORTING IT'S NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE TIMES IS REPORTING THIS MORNING THAT THE POLICE HAD TO SPEND A YEAR TRAWLING THROUGH THE PRIVATE PAPERS OF SIR EDWARD HEATH AS PART OF THEIR INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE WILTSHIRE POLICE HAVEN'T CONFIRMED THE STORY BUT SAY THEIR INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING AND THEY ARE CONDUCTING A NUMBER OF INQUIRIES
WELL WE'RE JOINED BY MICHAEL MCMANUS WHO HELP THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER WRITE HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY THE COURSE OF MY LIFE WHICH IS PUBLISHED BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING PERHAPS IF THAT PERHAPS IT'S NOT SURPRISING IF THEY'RE CARRYING OUT AN INVESTIGATION THAT THEY SHOULD GO TO HIS PAPERS THERE THE MORE SURPRISING THING MIGHT BE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY ARE TAKING AND DOING IT AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ACCORDING TO THE TIMES OF THE GOODNESS THAT IT WOULD COST TO GO THROUGH THEM
YES WELL I GATHER WILTSHIRE POLICE ARE A BIT STRAPPED FOR CASH AT THE MOMENT SO I'M SURPRISED PUTTING SO MUCH EFFORT AND RESOURCES INTO THIS AND I KNOW THOSE PAPERS VERY WELL AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ANYTHING INCRIMINATING AT ALL WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
WELL THEY WERE DAMAGED THE FIRST THING I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT THEY'RE QUITE BIG GAPS BECAUSE THEY WERE KEPT IN THE BASEMENT OF A HOTEL WHERE THERE WAS A FLOOD
SO THEY WERE QUITE BIG GAPS IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN DOING THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY WITH WITH EDWARD HEATH THAT A LOT OF HIS CAREER WASN'T REPRESENTED BECAUSE IT HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY TOGETHER FIND A LOT OF DIARIES A LOSS OF VERY DULL CORRESPONDENCE
IT REALLY WENT IT ISN'T PARTICULARLY INTERESTING MOST OF THE PAPER THERE WAS A BUSY LIFE HE HAD I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT THEY'LL DISCOVER JUST HOW CRAMMED HIS DIARY WAS AND ALSO HOW HEAVILY CONTROLLED HIS LIFE WAS REALLY FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES ONWARDS
BUT I SUPPOSE WHAT I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT POLICE HAVE BEEN CRITICISED ANOTHER INVESTIGATIONS AS THEY DIDN'T MATCH UP WHAT PEOPLE SAID ABOUT WHERE SOMEONE WAS AT A CERTAIN TIME WITH WHAT THEY COULD HAVE FOUND FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS AND THAT'S WHERE PRESUMABLY THESE PAPERS COULD HELP I SUPPOSE SO YES BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE A RATHER UNSPECIFIC ABOUT TIMES AND PLACES
SO I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PROVE INNOCENCE VERY EASILY AND IT WAS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE YOU CAN'T PROVE INNOCENCE VERY EASILY AND I SAY WHAT I FOUND DISTASTEFUL AND VERY CONCERNING FROM THE BEGINNING ABOUT ALL OF THIS I THINK IT'S BECAUSE HE'S DEAD AND THEREFORE DEFAMATION PROTECTION DOESN'T EXIST FOR HIM
ALMOST A PRESUMPTION OF GUILT TO RATHER THAN THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE WHICH INVERTS THE TRADITION OF MAGNA CARTA AND I I FIND THAT VERY UNSETTLING AND I SAY DISTASTEFUL REALLY AND I SUPPOSE THERE IS ONE ARGUMENT IS THAT THESE PAPERS MAY BE ABLE TO QUICKLY ESTABLISH THAT HE DIDN'T BUT THAT THE INVESTIGATION SHOULDN'T GO ANY FURTHER ALL CLOSE SOME LINES OF ENQUIRY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN AWFUL LOT OF MATERIAL AREN'T WE
YES THE TIMES REPORTS FOUR AND A HALF THOUSAND BOXES IT WASN'T THAT MANY WHEN I SORTED IT ALL OUT IT WAS ABOUT A THOUSAND I THINK SO I DON'T THINK THERE ARE FOUR AND A HALF THOUSAND BOXES BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S A IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL PERSONAL ARCHIVE OF SOMEBODY WHO FOR THE GALLANT WAR CAMPAIGN IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES IT WAS A BUSY PUBLIC FIGURE THEY'RE AFTER MICHAEL MCMANUS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S FIVE TO NINE NOW THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF SERIOUS MUSIC LOVERS THOSE YOU CAN IMAGINE NO BETTER WAY OF SPENDING FOUR DAYS THAN SITTING IN AN OPERA HOUSE LISTENING TO WAGNER'S RING CYCLE ALL OF IT AND THOSE WOULD RUN A MILE TO AVOID IT SO MAYBE THIS IS THE ANSWER OH
IF YOU HEAR A SLEEP CRATER AND ANY MAN WHO FINDS NO I GOT NO CHOICE NOT JUST ANY MAN NOT SOME DRUNKEN
ALL RIGHT WELL WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE YOU DON'T ONLY GOES ON FOR TWO HOURS ACTUALLY THAT ONE DOES THE NEXT RINSE SOMETHING COOL AND NEW PRODUCTION BY UNEXPECTED OPERA AS IT'S ONLY TWO HOURS LONG SO IS THIS THE ANSWER WILL IN BEANSTALK IS ITS ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AND INDEED DIRECTOR OF OF UNEXPECTED ROBERT THAT IS DIRECTOR WITH THE RINSE CYCLE UND TOM SERVICE PRESENTS A RADIO THREE'S MUSIC MATTERS WHEN HE'S WITH ME AND HE'S A SERIOUS FAN SO LYNNE SACRILEGE OR WHAT
IT'S AN OPENING AT THE DOOR TO ANYONE WHO'S CURIOUS ABOUT THIS GREAT MASTERPIECE RIGHT ALL THOSE PEOPLE IN BETWEEN THE ONES WHO WANT TO SPEND THOSE FOUR DAYS IN THE ONES WHO WANT TO RUN A MILE O.K. IS IT TRUE THAT IT WAS INSPIRED BY A CARTOON I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE CARTOON AT THE MOMENT IT DID DID IT IS IT TRUE WE COMMISSIONED A WRITER ROGER MORTIMER TO GIVE US A COMIC STRIP IN WHICH WE COULD HOUSE

THREE WASHING MACHINES WHICH ARE BRANDED BISH BASH AND BOSH SO THERE ARE SOME VARIATIONS FROM WAGNER'S APPROACH I THINK WE COULD SAFELY SAY VERY MUCH BUT IF YOU HAVE A LAUNDROMAT AND PATISSERIE VALKYRIE I'M STAGE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DERIVE MOST OF THE ACTION IN THE SHOW FROM THOSE LOCATION WITHOUT TOM YOU'RE YOU'RE LAUGHING AT THIS YOU SHOULD BE REALLY CROSS OSCAR'S EURGH
PUREST GUARD A LITTLE BIT OF THE ROOT THERE IS AN HONOURABLE TRADITION HERE OF WAGNER PARODIES OR GOES BACK REALLY VERY RIGHT DEEP INTO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ROSSINI ROSSINI SAID VULGAR IS FULL OF WONDERFUL MOMENTS AND TERRIBLE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE WHAT LYNNE'S DOING WITH UNEXPECTED UP HE'S ONLY AFTER ALL REVEALING THERE AND THEREFORE GIVING GIVING WHAT HE WOULD HAVE WANTED AND MANY OTHERS AS A FANTASTIC BUGS BUNNY ELMER FUDD CARTOON FROM NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN BUT IT'S AXIOMATIC THAT WHEN

PRIME MINISTER CAMERON SUGGESTED MORE COMPETITION A DEEPENING THE SINGLE MARK BUT HE'S THE BENEFIT ISSUE THEIR HITS A NERVE WITH EASTERN EUROPEANS BECAUSE THEY ARMED THEY SEE HE DOES AS BEING TREATED AS SECONDARY E.U. CITIZENS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ADDS TO THE DRAMA AND ALSO FROM PEOPLE I WAS SPEAKING TO LAST NIGHT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY MIND A LOT OF WHAT DAVID CAMERON'S ASKING FOR THEY FEAR WHAT IT COULD LEAD TO THIS QUESTION OF CONTAGION WHICH COULD MEAN
THAT PERHAPS SPAIN ITALY SOME OTHER COUNTRY WILL SAY HOLD ON A SEC WHAT ABOUT PENSIONS LET'S DRAG PENSIONS INTO THIS EXACTLY DID NEVER SAID I CAN'T SHE'S BASICALLY WANT TO PREVENT THAT OTHER COUNTRIES GET IDEAS FROM THESE PROPOSALS AND MY CLUB BACK ON SOCIAL BENEFITS OR ARE THERE OTHER WELFARE BENEFITS TO WORKERS ACROSS EUROPE SO YOUNG THEY COULD OPEN THE DOOR FOR
PETERSFIELD THIS IDEA OF CUTTING A DEAL FOR BRITAIN THERE ARE IN ONE SENSE THAT CONTAGION COULD APPLY TO ANY ELEMENT OF IT YEAH IN THAT WEE CONTAGION THAT OTHER COUNTRIES WANT TO DO THE SAME THING THAT BRITAIN HAS BUT WE'VE CURRENT POLITICAL LEADERS SAY WELL YOU KNOW KEVIN I GOT ALL THESE GREAT THINGS FOR HIMSELF MAYBE I SHOULD GO TO BRUSSELS AND THREATENED TO HAVE A REFERENDUM IF I DON'T GET MY WAY IN WE'VE HAD RATHER A MATERIAL WHEN ZEY SHALL NEVER RUSSELL SCREAMING UP WE'LL GO FORGETTING BILLIONS BUDGET WE'VE HAD OBVIOUSLY UNDER THE MIRACLE DEMANDING SINGS A REFUGEE CRISIS
SOMETHING PEOPLE GETTING IDEAS IS TO PUT A CONTAGION AS WELL I COULD BUT YOU SAY CAMERON GETTING ALL THESE GREAT THINGS FOR HIMSELF WHICH IS NOT HOW IT'S PING REPORTED BANK IN THE U.K. I THINK HE DID VERY WELL HERE BECAUSE THE BRUSSELS BUBBLE IN THE WESTMINSTER BUBBLE ARE INCREDIBLY SEPARATE ON THIS I MEAN WE SORT OF WOKE UP WE SAW THE TUSK DRAFT WE SAW HATE CANNOT CAMP GLADYS FOR YEARS AND IF YOU ASK ME TWO MONTHS AGO WITH YOU WE'VE GOT ANYTHING CLOSE TO THAT

SAYING WE'VE PROTECTED PROTECTED OUR WORKERS IN THE U.K. SO WILL A DEAL BE DONE
