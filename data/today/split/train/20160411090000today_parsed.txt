THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LOOK AT THE PAPER SENT TAX ON QUITE A FEW OF THE FRONT PAGES AND TAKE VERY DIFFERENT TAKES ON IT DEPENDING OF COURSE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MAIL ENOUGH OF THIS MADNESS IS ITS COMMENT COLUMN WHICH IT HIGHLIGHTS ON THE FRONT PAGE AND SERVE GROVELLING BEFORE THE POLITICS OF ENVY MOB THE P.M. SHOULD BE SHOUTING FROM THE ROOFTOPS THAT MOST PEOPLE FOR MOST PEOPLE INHERITANCE TAX
BY RE TAXING TAXED INCOME IS IMMORAL ITSELF THE GUARDIAN NOT OF COURSE TAKING THAT VIEW AND PREFERRING TO LEAD ON THE NEW BOSS OF H.M. A SENIOR TAX AUTHORITIES WHO WAS HER PARTNER THE GUARDIAN SAYS IN A COMPANY THAT ITSELF HAD A LINK ACTED FOR
ORGANISATIONS THAT WERE LINKED TO THE PANAMA PAPERS AND SPECIFICALLY TO THE LAW FIRM INVOLVED IN THE PANAMA PAPERS DUG ALSO MENTIONS THAT THE NEW BOSS EDWARD TROUPE HIS NAME IS THE NEW EXECUTIVE CHAIR OF H.M.R.C. ONCE DESCRIBED TAXATION IN A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE AS LEGALISED EXTORTION
OTHER TIMES PICKS ON UP ON THEM REALLY QUITE STARTLING AND ALARMING REPORT THAT'S BEEN DONE IN SURGERY ON THE N.H.S. AND THEY'VE GOT A NUMBER OF COMMENTS ABOUT ITS CONCLUSIONS ONE FOR THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS WHICH HAS WARNED THAT THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS ARE DYING BECAUSE THE N.H.S. IS CUTTING CORNERS ON OPERATIONS FOR THE CRITICALLY ILL
THE COLLEGE IS MAKES THE POINT THAT LIFE OR DEATH SURGERY IS NOT TAKEN AS SERIOUSLY AS ROUTINE OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF ILLOGICAL TARGETS AND IT'S LOOKED AT THE STATS OF THOSE WHO DIE AFTER SURGERY AND THERE IS A REMARKABLE RANGE IN DIFFERENT HOSPITALS WITH NO CLEAR REASON FOR THE DIFFERENCE THE LEAST GOOD BIRD THIS IS THE CONCLUSION IN THE TIMES FOR SOME PROCEDURES TEN TIMES AS MANY PATIENTS DIE AND SOME HOSPITALS
AS IN OTHERS THE REPORT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE AUTHORS IS A DIRECTOR AT THE NUFFIELD TRUST CANDICE EMERSON AND IT PAINTS AN EXTRAORDINARY PICTURE OF THE
ALMOST A LOTTERY AS TO WHERE YOU'RE HAVING SURGERY IN THE N.H.S. AND QUITE A FEW PAPERS PICK UP ON THE SURVEY TO BE DONE FOR CHANNEL FOUR ABOUT MUSLIM OPINION IN BRITAIN NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF BRITISH MUSLIMS WOULD NOT CONTACT THE POLICE IF SOMEONE THEY KNEW WAS GETTING INVOLVED WITH SUPPORTERS OF SIRHAN EXTREMISM IS WHAT THE TELEGRAPHS TAKE ON THE SURVEY IS
SO HE WAS CARRIED UP CHANNEL FOUR FOUND ANY THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF MUSLIMS WHO AGREED TO A DETAIL FACE TO FACE INTERVIEW WOULD GO TO THE POLICE AND REPORT EXTREMIST CONCERNS HAVE ANOTHER EIGHTY THREE PER CENT OF INTERVIEWEES WHO COULD PICK MULTIPLE RESPONSES IN THE POLL SO THEY WOULD EITHER LOOK FOR HELP OR ATTEMPT TO DISSUADE THE PERSON FROM ENGAGING WITH EXTREMISM IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST SIX
NOW LET US TURN TO THE GULF WHICH CAN BE A BIT LIKE TENNIS CAN'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO ENJOY THE GAME TO GET THE DRAMA I'VE BEEN TALKING TO OUR GOLF CORRESPONDENT IN CARTER ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE MASTERS AND JUST HOW MUCH OF A SURPRISE THE VICTORY OF DANNY WELL IT WAS FOR HIM AND FOR US ALL
WELL IT WAS A HUGE SURPRISE SIMPLY BECAUSE JORDAN'S SPEECH WAS SUCH A RED HOT FAVOURITE TO WIN HEAT ONE WIRE TO WIRE SO HE'D LEAD AFTER ALL FOUR ROUNDS LAST YEAR HE LED AFTER THE FIRST ROUND HERE THE SECOND ROUND HERE
AND THEN WE CAME TO THE THIRD ROUND AND HE LED AGAIN COMING INTO THIS FINAL ROUND NOT ONLY THAT HE PLAYED MAGNIFICENT GOLF ON THE FRONT NINE FOUR UNDER PAR THIRTY TWO HE LED THE MASTERS BY FIVE SHOTS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FINAL ANALYSIS HE COULD'VE PLAYED THE BACK NINE IN ONE OVER AND STILL WON
HOWEVER HE DROP SHOTS AT THE TENTS AND THE ELEVENTH AND THEN AT THE TWELFTH HE PUT THE BALL INTO THE WATER WITH HIS TEE SHOT THIS IS A SHORT PAR THREE THE SHORTEST HOLE ON THE GOLF COURSE BUT ALWAYS DEVILISHLY DIFFICULT AND A REAL TEST OF THEIR PLAYERS NO HE HAD TO TAKE A PENALTY DROP IT PUT THE NEXT ONE INTO THE WATER AND ENDED UP TAKING A QUADRUPLE BOGEY SEVEN WHICH SUDDENLY TOOK HIM OUT OF THE LEAD
SIMULTANEOUSLY WILLETT HAD BEEN CALMLY GOING ABOUT HIS BUSINESS PICKING UP BIRDIES AND AN ALL OF A SUDDEN WAS THRUST INTO THE LEAD AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS ABOUT TO TEE OFF ON THE PAR THREE SIXTEENTH
HE'S LOOKED AT THE LEADER BOARD AND SAW THAT HE WAS LEADING AND PROMPTLY TOOK HIMSELF OFF TO A PORTALOO TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK CAN OPPOSE AND START AND THEN HIT THE MOST MAGNIFICENT TEE SHOT IN SLOT AT HOME THE SIX FOOT FOR A BIRDIE AND THEN PARDON TO COMPLETE A SENSATIONAL VICTORY A HUGE VICTORY FOR THE BRITISH GOAL AND ONE THAT NO ONE WAS EXPECTING AND IT'S HIS COMPOSURE IS IT THAT WAS REALLY THE FOUNDATION OF
OH YES PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK TO THE LAST TIME AN ENGLISHMAN WON THE MASTERS WHICH WAS FULLY TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN NICK FALDO BEAT GREG NORMAN AND OVERHAULED A SIX SHOT DEFICIT ON THE FINAL DAY THERE WITH A FAULTLESS ROUND OF SIXTY SEVEN BY COINCIDENCE IT WAS A SIXTY SEVEN FOUR
DANNY WILL IT AS WELL AND YOU COULD DRAW ALL SORTS OF PARALLELS BETWEEN THE GREATEST BRITISH GOLFER IN MODERN TIMES NICK FALDO AND THE PERFORMANCE THAT HE PUT IN TWENTY YEARS AGO SO THERE ONE THERE
WILL IT PUT TOGETHER HERE AND CERTAINLY IN AMERICA THIS WILL BE REMEMBERED AS MUCH FOR JORDAN SPECIES LOSING IT BUT I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT IT AND SAY WELL DANNY WILL IT WON IT WITH HIS COMPOSURE AND THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS FINAL ROUT IAN CARTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN IN EDINBURGH WON'T BE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TODAY BECAUSE THEIR SCHOOL BUILDINGS ARE NOT CONSIDERED SAFE JAMIE MCIVOR IS OUR CORRESPONDENT AND JAMIE THIS THE FIRST WARNINGS APPEAR BACK IN JANUARY BUT THIS WAS ONLY ANNOUNCED ON LATE LAST WEEK
WELL INDEED LEYTON FINDIN ENTITIES OWNED ABOUT HALF PAST SEVEN AND THIS IS A SITUATION IN SCOTLAND WHICH SPLIT APPEAR TO BE TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED SEVENTEEN SCHOOLS IN EDINBURGH WILL BE CLOSED INDEFINITELY OVER SAFETY CONCERNS AND AS YOU SEE IS SEVEN THOUSAND PUPILS ARE AFFECTED WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEN PRIMARY SCHOOLS
SECONDARIES AND TWO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT NEEDS SCHOOLS NO THESE ARE ALL SCHOOLS BUILT AROUND TEN YEARS AGO UNDER THE PRIVATE FINANCE INITIATIVE SCHEME THROUGH AN ORGANISATION CALLED THE EDINBURGH SCHOOLS PARTNERSHIP THE ESSENTIAL ISSUE HERE IS WITH THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE SCHOOLS THE CONCERN SEEMS TO BE THAT SOME WARM TIME IS A MISSING
ESSENTIALLY THIS IS WHERE THE ARE TIES SUCH AS A METAL STRIP PUT A BAR BETWEEN TWO WONGS TO HELP SUPPORT THEM AND SO THE COUNCIL HAS TAKEN THIS DECISION TO CLOSE THE SCHOOL'S INDEFINITELY OIL THEY HAD INSPECTED PROPERLY TO ADDRESS SAFETY CONCERNS ONE THERE WAS A WALL THAT FELL DOWN IN JANUARY AT ORCS GANGS PRIMARY SCHOOL HAVE THERE BEEN PROBLEMS AT THE OTHER SCORES ARE THEY JUST FEARFUL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUILT WITH THE SAME METHODS
ESSENTIALLY FEARFUL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUILT AS PART OF THE SCENE PROJECT AS YOU SEE THEIR PROBLEMS WERE FIRST UNCOVERED BACK IN JANUARY WHEN I WAS THAT OXEGEN SPRING BUT HIS SCHOOL COLLAPSED DURING HIGH WINDS THREE OTHER SCHOOLS WOULD LATER CLOSED AFTER INSPECTIONS ALSO PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY WALLS HAD BEEN BUILT
FRESH CONCERNS WERE RAISED DURING REMEDIAL WORK AT OCH SCANS ON FRIDAY THEN THE THE COUNCIL SAID THAT THE EDINBURGH SCHOOLS PARTNERSHIP WAS ON WAS UNABLE TO GIVE THE ASSURANCES IT REQUIRED THAT ALL THE BUILDINGS BUILT UNDER THIS PARTICULAR SCHEME WERE SEEN
SO YOU SAY THEY'RE CLOSED INDEFINITELY WE PRESUMABLY IT'S JUST NOT KNOWN WHAT COULD HAPPEN AT THESE SCHOOLS ARE THERE MORE SCHOOLS COS THERE ARE OTHER SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE IN GLASGOW THEY HAVEN'T OPENED YET AND THEY'RE MORE SCHOOLS THAT COOK MIGHT YET STAY CLOSE
CERTAINLY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT HAS A URGED OTHER COUNCILS AND SCOTS AND TO INSPECT THEIR BUILDINGS THERE'S A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE SITUATION AND FIFE GLASGOW AND INVERCLYDE WE'RE THE SAME CONSTRUCTION COMPANY HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME SCHOOLS BUT AT THE MOMENT THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN NO DECISION TAKEN TO CLOSE ANY OTHER SCHOOLS SCHOOL HOLIDAYS OF COURSE IN SCOTLAND V.D. FROM AREA TO INDIA'S BUT BUT THEY END SCHOOLS WHERE DUTY TURN TODAY
OTHER SCHOOLS IN SCOTLAND MANY OF THEM WERE STILL ON HOLIDAY WE'LL SPEAK TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF EDINBURGH COUNCIL LATER IN THE PROGRAMME JAMIE MCIVOR THANKS SIXTY MINUTES PAST SIX TO THE BUSINESS AND STEAL AND SHOW AS WITH THIS MORNING LOVE INJURE YEAH GOOD MORNING TO YOU JUST TODAY TUT OFFICIALLY PUBLISHERS IT'S PROSPECTUS FOR ANY POTENTIAL BUYERS OF ITS U.K. STEEL BUSINESS THERE HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF INFORMAL TALKS WITH BUYERS BUT TODAY TAT WILL OPEN THE BOOKS A LITTLE BIT WIDER
IT COMES AS ONE OF ITS STEEL PLANTS IN SCUNTHORPE WOULD BE OFFICIALLY SOLD TO GREY BALL CAPITAL A COMPANY WHICH SPECIALISES IN TURNING AROUND STRUGGLING BUSINESSES IT SUCCEEDED WITH MONARCH AIRLINES BUT WOODS LESS SUCCESSFUL AT COMET ELECTRICAL RICHARD DUNBAR JOINS US FROM ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGER GOOD MORNING RICHARD GOOD MORNING A LOT OF HOPE IS RESTING ON THE SHOULDERS OF SCENT YOU'VE GOT THE BOSS OF LIBERTY CAPITAL FOR TAKING OVER POTENTIALLY THE PORT TALBOT STEELWORKS THERE IS DEMAND FOR SPECIALIST AREAS AND LIBERTY HOUSE
SANJIT GIPPED AS BUSINESS BOUGHT CLYDE'S DYLAN MILLS AND LANARKSHIRE LAST WEEK SO THERE'S A REAL REASON TO SUGGEST WHY HE AND THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED BUT HE DID SAY YESTERDAY THAT HE WASN'T MARRIED TO THE DEAL IT'S TOO BIG A DEAL TO GET WRONG AND IT COULD PUT THE WHOLE COMPANY AT RISK IF HE DID SO SO IT DOES SUGGEST THAT THE GUARANTEES AROUND THIS WILL BE EXPENSIVE
TAT OUT THE TAXPAYER OR INDEED BOTH YES INDEED I MEAN HE'S HE'S TALKING ABOUT HE'S TALKING ABOUT GETTING POWER COSTS DOWN WITH BRITAIN PAYING BRITISH LARGE ENERGY USE WHO'S PAYING MORE THAN THEIR CONTINENTAL RIVALS
THE CLIMATE LEVY THAT'S ADDED TO DOUBT AS WELL AND THERE'S THE PENSION ISSUE TWO VERY BIG STUMBLING POINT'S HE DOESN'T WANT TO TOUCH YOU JUST WANT TO PAY THE SAME POWER RATES NOR DOES HE WANT TO TOUCH THE BUT PENSION DEAF SORT OF HALF A BILLION POUNDS IT DOES SEEM THAT THERE IS SOME SYMPATHY WITH THE PA PRICE ARGUMENT FROM THE POLITICIANS AND LISA DOES LIKE THAT THERE'LL BE SOME LEEWAY ON THAT I THINK THE PENSIONER SHE WILL BE
YOU SOLUBLE FOR HIM I SUSPECT THAT MEANS OF THE LIABILITIES WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO US THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND TO PENSION PROTECTION FUND OR OTHERS AND INDEED WHEN ONE SEES WHAT'S GONE ON AT SCUNTHORPE WE'VE SEEN PAY CUTS SWISS IN PENSION PAYMENT REDUCED THERE WE'VE SEEN JOB LOSSES I THINK SLIGHTLY WE'LL SEE SOME SORT OF SOFT A GOVERNMENT LOAN ATTACHED TO THAT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT TRANSFERRING AT THE LIABILITIES TO OTHERS ON TRYING TO KEEP THE ASSETS FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR BY THE LOOK OF IT
AT SCUNTHORPE AND D.L. TOOK SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE TALKS TO COMPLETE THEM WHO'S TO SAY THE PORT TALBOT WILL TAKE AT LEAST THAT LONG
I WOULD SUSPECT IT WILL WE'VE TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE DEAL AND THE LIABILITIES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THOSE LIABILITIES ARE HUGE AND THE VALUATION OF THE ASSETS EBB AND FLOW WITH THE AIRMEN FLOWS OF WHAT IS A VERY VOLATILE GLOBAL COMMODITY SO THE VALUATION OF THE SORTS OF BUSINESSES IS VERY DIFFICULT AND THE VALUATION OF THE LIABILITIES ATTACHED TO THEM BUT HE'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT SO I WOULD SUSPECT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME I WAS SUSPECT ANY BUYERS
WILL BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH THESE SORTS OF ASSETS BECAUSE AS BEFORE THE MONEY HAS BEEN MADE OUT OF STEEL PUT MONEY AND SIGNIFICANT HASN'T BEEN MASTERED OF STEEL AS WELL CAN I ASK YOU FINALLY ABOUT I READ IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT THE DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST IS MULLING A BID FOR PART OF YAHOO NO LESS WELL IT BE FAIR TO SAY YAHOO HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT UNDER PRESSURE TO TURN ITSELF AROUND THE FIRMER STRUGGLED AGAINST FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE AND SALES OF HAVE TO HAVE PASSED
TEN YEARS IN CONTRAST MAIL ONLINE HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLY SUCCESSFUL AND THE MOST VISITED ENGLISH LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER WEBSITE IN THE WORLD AND LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE INTERESTED IN THE MEDIA AND USE PROPERTIES IN THERE LOOKS LIKE PRIVATE EQUITY MIGHT IT GET INVOLVED IN THE SEARCH ENGINE BUT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER THE TERMS OF THIS DEAL ARE ACCEPTABLE TO WHAT HAVE BEEN LONG SUFFERING SHAREHOLDERS
INDEED THANK YOU RICHARD DONE BY THERE FROM ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT BRITISH BANKS HAVE PAID OUT A WHOPPING FIFTY THREE BILLION POUNDS IN FINES AND REPAYMENTS FOR THEIR MISS DEEDS OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS THIRTY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS HAS BEEN ON P.P.I. ALONE FOUR TIMES THE COST OF HOSTING THE LONDON OLYMPICS A MAN WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT BANKING MISDEMEANOURS AND BEHAVIOUR IS LORD JOHN MCFALL WHO USED TO CHAIR THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE BEFORE FOUNDING THE NEW CITY AGENDA THINK TANKARD MORNING ROBERT GOOD MORNING TO YOU
WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS GLEAN FROM ALL THIS THESE FINES PAID OUT BY RETAIL BANKS WELL WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING THIS FOR A FEW YEARS UNTIL NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN WE DID AN INQUIRY INTO THE CULTURE OF BANKING AND FOUND THAT THE BANKS HAD SET ASIDE THIRTY EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION POUNDS WITH THAT TAME AS YOU MENTION FOUR TIMES THE COURSE THE LONDON OLYMPICS BUT ONE YEAR LATER THAT FIGURES INCREASED TO FIFTY THREE BILLION POUNDS I'M SPEAKING FROM GLASGOW
I'LL PUT THIS IN A SCOTTISH CONTEXT THAT FIFTY THREE BILLION POEMS WOULD HAVE PAID FOR THE SCOTTISH EDUCATION BUDGET FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS AND ALSO IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN US GIVE EVERY WORKING SQUAT AND INCOME TAX CUT OF ONE THOUSAND POUNDS PER ANNUM FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS SO THAT'S THE CONTEXT THAT WE HAVE TO
THEY TO YOU GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENT WELL AND TODAY ABOUT AUSTERITY AND THE EMPIRE TO ISN'T PUBLIC SERVICES AND IN WAGES AND SALARIES JUST PLAYING DEVIL'S ADVOCATE FOR A MOMENT JOHN AT THE THIRTY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS BEEN GIVEN BACK
TO BANK ACCOUNT HOLDERS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A MAJOR TAX CUT THAT WAS AN O.K. NOT EVERYBODY HAD A P.P.I. MISSELLING ISSUE BUT THOSE OR DID SUDDENLY GOT THOUSANDS OF POUNDS BACK WELL ACTUALLY IT GEORGE OSBORNE WAS BEFORE THE HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I MADE THE POINT TO HIM AT THE TIME THAT THAT THIRTY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS WAS EQUIVALENT OF IT TWO PER CENT INCREASE FROM GROWTH
THE QUESTION HAS TO MAS DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE YOUR ECONOMIC MODEL BASED IN SUCH A LOPSIDED ARRANGEMENT TO WHICH HE SAID NO
THAT IS AGGRESSIVE SALES AND THE CULTURE OF AGGRESSIVELY PUSHING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS IS IT GONE NOW FROM THE BANKING SECTOR
SOME BANKS HAVE MADE IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT BUT WE HEAR FROM TRADE UNIONS AND THERE WAS THE FRONT LINE STAFF BUT THERE ARE STILL PLEASURES AND PEOPLE
TO SAIL AND IT WAS THAT CARO'S OF APPROACH THAT CAUSED THE ISSUE OF P.P.I. AND IT'S ALL TOO EASY TO COME BACK THAT'S WHY WE ARE SEEING THAT CULTURAL CHANGE IT'S IMPORTANT
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A TRANSPARENCY AND PROGRESS WHAT BANKS WERE DOING AND THAT HAS TO BE AVAILABLE AND HAS TO COMPETE HERE IT DIFFERENT BANKS YOU REMEMBER AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THE AIR SHE DROPPED THE END WEIGHT PROBE INTO BANKING ANTIGUA'S EVE NO LESS
PARDON BUT THEY DROPPED AND DIGGERS HEAVE EXACTLY WHEN IT WAS A QUIET EVENING TERMS A NEWS BUT THE REASON FOR THAT THIS IT WAS EVERY COMPANY IS UNIQUE IN YOU AND IT CANNOT BE COMPARED WELL ACTUALLY THAT IS A FALLACY AND IF YOU LOOK AT P. P. A. EVERY COMPANY WAS TO SEE HIM AND THEY WERE ALL SELLING THIS PRODUCT AND THAT'S WHY HE WASN'T THAT THAT PROBLEM TODAY SO UNTIL WE GET THAT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPORTING PUBLICLY ON THAT THEN ONE NEVER GOING TO GET ANY CHANGE
TALKING OF TRANSPARENCY THERE'S A NEW LAW PLANS TO MAKE COMPANIES CRIMINALLY LIABLE FOR FACILITATING TAX EVASION THIS HE'S BEEN IN RUSHED THROUGH IN THE WAKE OF THE PANAMA PAPERS LEAKS FROM MON SAC VON SECKER WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT LAURENT FOR WELL AS A VETERAN OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION FOR BANKING STANDARDS I DO HAVE A VIEW IN THAT BEAR WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
SET FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS OF ENDED UP SEVEN FOR TWO YEARS OR TEN THOUSAND QUESTIONS LATER AND THE ONE CONCLUSION WAS THAT PERSONAL LIABILITY AND PESTLE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE BANKING SECTOR IS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT THE PENALTIES WILL GO IN THE COMPANY
THE SENIOR EXEC AS OR THEN CLAIM THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THEN OR WALTZ OFF INTO THE SUNSET WITH HIGH BONUSES THIS IS A KNEE JERK REACTION AT THE MOMENT DOES IT HAVE POTENTIAL
YES BUT IT NEEDS TO BE CRAFTED TO ENSURE THAT SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MISCONDUCT FOLLOWING THE PARLIAMENT TO COMMISSION BANKING STANDARDS I'M MOVES IN A MEMBER AND HOSTS A LAWS THAT THE SENIOR EXECUTIVES SHOULD ADOPT A DUTY OF CARE RESPONSIBILITY
JOHN KEY IN HIS BOOK AND IN THE LECTURES HE'S GIVEN TO OUR THINK TANK IS SAID AT THAT COULD BE TRANSFORMING ELEMENT IN THE BANKING SECTOR WE WON THAT VOTE NO SO LARGE THAT WENT BACK TO HIS FOR COMMENTS AND THAT WAS DEFEATED SAW I'VE SEEN
THE FUTURE WERE BACK TO THE FUTURE ITS WONDERS FEEL COMPLETELY AND THEY REALLY NEED TO NAIL THIS DOWN IT'S A NEW WOMAN HAS POTENTIAL NORBERT FALL THEIR FORMER HEAD OF THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE IN THERE WITH NEW CITY AGENDA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US OUR SURVEY OF OVER EIGHT THOUSAND FIRMS BUT THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE OUT THIS MORNING REVEALS THAT U.K. ECONOMIC GROWTH IS STATIC BECAUSE OF MOUNTING GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC UNCERTAINTIES
IT ALSO SHOWS HISTORICALLY LOW CONFIDENCE IN TURNOVER AND PROFITABILITY WERE ADAM MARSHALL IS THE ACTING DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BBC GOOD MORNING MADAM GOOD MORNING JANE WHAT DID YOU FIND WELL I THINK THE MAIN STORY HERE IS ONE OF SOFTENING ECONOMIC GROWTH WERE FAR FROM GOING INTO REVERSE HERE IN THE U.K. BUT THIS REALLY LARGE SAMPLE OF BUSINESSES IS TELLING US THAT THEY ARE ON A BIT OF A DOWNWARD TREND LOOK AT WE HAVEN'T SPOKE ABOUT THE REFERENDUM FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES SO LET'S GET HER QUICKLY BACK IN THERE ARE YOU SAY SUGGESTING THAT
THERE WILL BE A SERIOUS PAUSE AND INVESTMENT IN THE CURRENT QUARTER THAT WE'RE IN THE RUN UP TO THIS VOTE WHAT CERTAINLY THE REFERENDUM WILL BE ONE OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS BUSINESSES ARE CONSIDERING AS THEY LOOK AT THEIR INVESTMENT PLANS BUT YOU'VE GOTTA REALISE OF COURSE BUSINESS IS ALSO OPERATING IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT AS LOTS OF UNCERTAINTIES AROUND THE WORLD AND OF COURSE THEY HAVE TROUBLES HERE AT HOME THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REFERENDUM FOR EXAMPLE MANY SAYING TO US THEY CAN'T GET THE STAFF THAT THEY NEED
SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS IN PLAY HERE I WOULDN'T PUT IT DOWN TO ANYONE SO THERE'S A SKILLS SHORTAGE IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH STRUCTURAL STUFF LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE IS THAT ALSO CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR COMPANIES WELL ABSOLUTELY COMPANIES REMAIN FRUSTRATED ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE DELAYED AIRPORTS EXPANSION PLAN THEY REMAIN FRUSTRATED ABOUT THE TIME THAT IT TAKES FOR NEW ROADS AND RAILWAYS TO GET DELIVERED AND THEY DO WANT TO SEE THOSE SPEEDED UP THE MESSAGE TO PEOPLE IN WESTMINSTER HAS GOT TO BE WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR INERTIA
IF GROWTH IS SLOW AND WE HAVE TO GET SOME OF THESE BIG INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND OF COURSE GET OUR TRAINING SCHEMES AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE SO THAT BUSINESSES HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO INVEST NOT JUST NOW BUT AFTER JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD AS WELL PRODUCTIVITY IS A BIG ISSUE ISN'T IT WE HEARD ON FRIDAY THAT WE SAW THE BIGGEST DECLINE AND PRODUCTIVITY IN THE U.K. SINCE THE GLOBAL CRASH OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THAT MUST CONCERN YOU MEMBERS
PRODUCTIVITY IS A BIG CONCERN AND WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING US IS THEY CAN'T GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED AND ALSO THAT THE UNCERTAIN GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT IS MAKING IT HARDER FOR THEM TO INVEST THERE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE TRADE STATISTICS AS WELL BECAUSE THEY SAY TO US WE NEED TO BE DOING BETTER AROUND THE WORLD SO WE DO HAVE SOME MOUNTAIN CONCERNS THAT YOU NEED TO BE ADDRESSED HERE AT FINALLY HOW'S THE JOB HUNT GOING FOR THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BBC BIGGEST ONE EXHIBIT QUITE QUICKLY DIDN'T IT

HE IS YES THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW LAW WHEREBY COMPANIES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES WHO FACILITATE TAX EVASION AND THAT WILL FORM PART OF A WHOLE RANGE OF ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER POINTING OF COURSE TO THE PUBLICATION OF THE SUMMARY THERE'S TAX RETURNS POINTING OF COURSE TO THE H.M.R.C. INQUIRY INTO THE PANAMA PAPERS UNDERLINING THAT HE WILL CO OPERATE WITH THESE STANDARDS COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO HIS AFFAIRS AND
I THINK THE HOPE IN DOWNING STREET IS THAT WE'LL DO IT ONE OF MY CAMERON'S COLLEAGUE SAID TO ME THIS MORNING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND I THINK THEIR HOPE IS THAT THEN HE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE ON AND HE REMINDS ME A BIT OF A VERY FAMOUS WEST WINNER WEST WING EPISODE WHERE THE PUTATIVE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE ALAN ALGER IS INVOLVED IN A SCANDAL ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER IN THE WAY HE DEALS WITH IT IS JUST TO STAND THERE FOR LITERALLY ABOUT TWO HOURS AND TAKE QUESTION AFTER QUESTION AFTER QUESTION WHATEVER PEOPLE WANT TO ASK
IN THE HOPE THAT THEN EVENTUALLY PEOPLE WILL JUST GET TIRED OF IT THAT SAID MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE PRIME MINISTER WILL NOT DISCLOSE ANY FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND IN OTHER SHARES WHICH HE ALSO SOLD OFF IN TWENTY TEN AT THE SAME TIME AS HE SOLD OFF THE BLAME
SHARES AND I THINK THE VIEW NUMBER TEN IS IF THEY START GOING DOWN THAT ROAD AS ONE PUT IT TO ME THEN THEY'LL END UP
ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER'S BANK ACCOUNT WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN SO WHETHER IT WILL SUCCEED IN DRAWING A LINE UNDER IT I THINK IS ANOTHER MATTER I THINK CERTAINLY WHAT WE'LL PROBABLY DO IS JUST CRANK UP THE PRESSURE EVEN MORE FOR FURTHER DISCLOSURE SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE CHANCELLOR
HE'S VERY LIKE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO PUBLISH HIS TAX RETURNS ALTHOUGH HIS AIDES INSIST HE'S NEVER OWNED ANY OFFSHORE FUNDS AND IN TERMS OF THE REST OF THE CABINET NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE THERE AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH A MATTER FOR INDIVIDUAL MINISTERS BUT YOU DO GET THE SENSE OF THE SORT OF MORAL BANDWAGON TRUNDLING ALONG FORCING EVERYONE
TO LEAP ABOARD WITH NOW ALL THESE SCOTTISH LEADER SAYING YOU KNOW THEY'LL PUBLISH THEIR TAX RETURNS TIM FARRON SAYING HE'LL PUBLISH HIS TAX RETURN JEREMY CORBIN SO ON AND SO FORTH AND JUST THIS WIDENING GULF OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW EXPECTED TO PUBLISH THEIR TAX RETURNS THE GUARDIAN HAS THE STORY THIS MORNING THAT THE H. EMMA OR C. THE REVENUE CHIEF WHO IS GOING TO BE CARRYING OUT THIS INQUIRY INTO THE PAN AM OR PAPERS
USED TO BE A PARTNER AT A LAW FIRM THAT ADVISED BLAIR MORE HOLDINGS I MEAN THIS IS A MAN WHO WAS DESCRIBED BY MARGARET HODGE WHO WAS CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE AS SOMEONE SAYING THE TAXES LEGALISED EXTORTION I SUSPECT LABOUR ARE VERY LIKELY TO PICK UP ON THAT BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT IS ALREADY BEING THAT H.M.R.C. ARE NOT WITH THE BODY TO CARRY OUT THIS INQUIRY INTO THE PAN
AFFAIRS AND INTO THE WHOLE QUESTION OF OFFSHORE TAX AVOIDANCE AND EVASION SO I SUSPECT THEY WILL USE THAT TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR ARGUMENT IT'S WORTH SAYING ACTUALLY I MEAN LABOUR HAVE MADE THE RUNNING ON THIS IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS FROM JEREMY CORBIN'S INITIAL INSISTENCE THAT THERE IS AN IN THAT MISTER CAMERON PUBLISHES TAX RETURNS
BUT THEY HAVE NOW GONE AN AWFY LONG WAY DOWN THE LINE AND IT DOES SEEM TO ME THERE WAS AN ISSUE FOR THEM TWO AS TO WHETHER THEY OVERREACH AND OVERPLAYED THEIR HAND PARTICULARLY OF COURSE BECAUSE WE HAD FROM THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL YESTERDAY SUGGESTING THERE WILL BE A REVIEW UNDER LABOUR OF INHERITANCE TAX THAT OBVIOUSLY FOLLOWS THE DISCLOSURE THERE MY CAMERA SOUP AROUND HALF A MILLION POUNDS FROM ITS PARENTS WHICH WAS A TAX BECAUSE IT DIDN'T BREACH INHERITANCE TAX BUT THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL YOU DON'T
GO BEYOND MORAL INDIGNATION INTO CLASS WAR BECAUSE INHERITANCE TAX IS ONE OF THOSE HUGELY EMOTIVE AND INCENDIARY ISSUES WHICH CAN BLOW UP IN YOUR FACE SO THERE IS TOO A CHALLENGE FOR LABOUR HERE NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN WE USE NOT TO BELIEVE PEOPLE PARTICULARLY CHILDREN WHEN THEY SAID THEY'D BEEN ABUSED NOW THOUGH DO WE BELIEVE THEM TOO MUCH ON THE PROGRAMME THIS MORNING WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM A MAN WHO WAS ACCUSED AND PUT THROUGH HELL BUT IN THE END THE CASE AGAINST TENSE SIMPLY DROPPED TARNISH OR IS ON THE LINE UP OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT AND DANNY YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE FIGURES FOR THE NUMBER OF CASES AND INDEED THE PROPORTION OF CASES GET TO COURT AND THEN
SUDDENLY GET NO FURTHER YES OF WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS ANALYSING THE DATA FROM THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE FOR THE NUMBER OF DROPPED CROWN COURT PROSECUTIONS ALSO REFER TO AS JUDGE ORDERED ACQUITTALS SO THESE ARE CASES WHERE SOMEONE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH AN OFFENCE IT GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE CROWN COURT BUT IN THE END THE CASE IS DROPPED BEFORE A TRIAL GETS UNDER WAY AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE FROM THE DATA IS TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THERE WERE TWELVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN
OF THESE CASES AND THAT REPRESENTS TWELVE POINT FIVE PER CENT OF ALL CROWN COURT PROSECUTION SO ONE IN EIGHT CROWN COURT PROSECUTIONS IT IS DROPPED AND THAT WAS IN FACT THE HIGHEST NUMBER AND THE HIGHEST PROPORTION FOR FIVE YEARS SO ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T READ TOO MUCH INTO ONE YEAR IS A SET OF DATA
KNOW I THINK CERTAINLY THOSE FIGURES WILL CAUSE SOME CONCERNS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE COST AND ALSO AT THE EMOTIONAL COST FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE THIS GENTLEMAN WHO YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU NO BUT WAIT MANY MANY MONTHS FOR THEIR CASE AND THEN HE TOLD IT'S NOT GOING HE MAKES THE SPECIFIC ALLEGATION THAT IN CASES OF ABUSE AND HE HAD BEEN AT ACCUSED OF PHYSICALLY ABUSING A CHILD THAT IN THOSE CASES THAT THAT IS WHERE THIS IS
IS HAPPENING BUT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU IN THE FIGURES AREN'T BROKEN DOWN LIKE THAT OVER THE FIGURES HAVE NOT BEEN BROKEN DOWN LIKE THAT FOR THIS YEAR HOWEVER I'VE DUG UP A REPORT FROM THREE YEARS AGO PRODUCED BY THE THINK TANK POLICY EXCHANGE
AND THEY DO SORT OF BREAK DOWN THESE THESE FIGURES FOR DROP PROSECUTIONS ABY CATEGORY OF OFFENCE AND THE CASES WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE DROPPED OUR CASES THE FENCES AGAINST THE PERSON VIOLENT OFFENCES THEFT AND HANDLING AND PUBLIC ORDER OFFENCES THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE DROPPED BUT SEX SEXUAL OFFENCES SIMILAR PROPORTIONS IT DOESN'T BREAK DOWN
BY THE NUMBER OF CASES IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE ACCUSED OF OFFENCES AGAINST CHILDREN AND THAT WILL BE SOMETHING PERHAPS AT THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE WILL COME UNDER PRESSURE TO BREAK DOWN YEAH CALL LATER IN THE PROGRAMME FOR THEM TO PROVIDE THOSE FIGURES THAN SURE THANK YOU AND WE'LL HEAR FROM PEACE OF THE PERSON WHO MADE THOSE ACCUSATIONS AT

YES IT WOULD BE A HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THIS TOWN I'M JUST STOOD AT THE GATES OF SCUNTHORPE STEELWORKS NOW IT'S A SPRAWLING PLANT THEY'RE COOLING TOWERS AND BLAST FURNACES DOMINATE THE SKYLINE HERE AND WORKERS HAVE BEEN ARRIVING FOR THE EARLY SHIFT THERE'S A STEADY STREAM OF CARS AND IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IT'S BEEN A REALLY DIFFICULT YEAR FOR PEOPLE HERE
BACK IN OCTOBER TARTARE ANNOUNCE NINE HUNDRED JOB LOSSES AT THE PLANS AND THIS SALE IS THIS SITE HAS BEEN UP FOR SALE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT'S WELL BEFORE OF COURSE STARTER SAID IT WANTED TO OFFLOAD ITS ENTIRE U.K. BUSINESS
AND IT'S HARD TO UNDERESTIMATE JUST HOW IMPORTANT HIS STEEL MAKING IS TO THIS TOWN AND THE PLANTS EMPLOYS FOUR THOUSAND WORKERS BUT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT IT SUPPORTS ANOTHER THIRTY THOUSAND JOBS IN THE WIDER ECONOMY
AS YOU SAID THEY'RE AFTER NEARLY NINE MONTHS OF INTENSE NEGOTIATIONS IS UNDERSTOOD THAT INVESTMENT FIRM GRRR ABLE CAPITAL COULD FINALISE A DEAL TO TAKE OVER THIS PLANT'S LATER THIS MORNING IT'S BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION POUND RESCUE PACKAGE
AS PART OF THAT TAKEOVER DEAL WORKERS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO TAKE TEMPORARY COUTTS IN PAY AND PENSIONS TO HELP SAVE THIS BUSINESS AND SAY THEIR JOBS BUT THAT IS THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WE'LL SAVE THOSE FOUR THOUSAND OBVIOUSLY THE REST OF TATA STEEL'S JOB STILL UP IN THE AIR
YES THERE IS THERE'S A REAL SENSE THAT WORK IS FEEL THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO MAKE THIS SACRIFICE ON PAY ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WOULD SECURE THE LONG TERM FUTURE AS THIS SITE IS PART OF THE LONG PRODUCTS DIVISION AND THE SENSE I'M GETTING HERE IS
THEY KNOW THIS INDUSTRY IS IN CRISIS IT'S STRUGGLING TO COMPETE WITH CHEAP CHINESE STEEL AND SAID TO HELP TURN THIS PLACE AROUND THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO TAKE THIS THREE PER CENT PAY COOK FOR A YEAR A TEMPORARY CUTTING PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE COMPANY

OOPS HERE SARAH CORK UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS SANDA THEIR PERSONAL FINANCES OF POLITICIANS CONTINUED TO DOMINATE THE FRONT PAGES OF THE DAILY MIRROR DEMANDS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT IT CALLS THE SET A SECOND SECRET STASH OF SHARES WORTH SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND REVEALED IN DAVID CAMERON'S TAX RETURNS ARE TIMES LEADS ON THE PRESSURE NOW BEING DIRECTED TOWARDS THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE
TO PUBLISH DETAILS OF HIS FINANCIAL AFFAIRS BUT THE DAILY MAIL CHAMPIONS THE RIGHT OF PARENTS TO PASS ON ASSETS TO THEIR CHILDREN ENOUGH OF THIS MADNESS IT INSTEAD OF GROVELLING TO THE POLITICS OF ENVY MOB THE P.M. SHOULD BE SHOUTING FROM THE ROOFTOPS THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE INHERITANCE TAX BY RE TAXING TAXED INCOME IS IMMORAL ITSELF THAT ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH IS AMONG THE SUBJECTS MY CAMERON WILL SPEAK ABOUT TODAY THE PAPER SAYS WHO USES A PARENT IN PARLIAMENT TO LAUNCH A ROBUST DEFENCE OF THE RIGHT OF PARENT TO PASS ON MONEY TO THEIR CHILD
THE LEAD IN THE GUARDIAN REPORTS THAT THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF REVENUE AND CUSTOMS EDWARD TROOP WAS ONCE A PARTNER AT A TOP CITY LAW FIRM THAT ACTED FOR THE OFFSHORE COMPANY SET UP BY DAVID CAMERON'S FATHER THERE'S NO SUGGESTION OF ANY WRONGDOING BUT SAYS THE PAPER IN AN EDITORIAL IT ALL CREATES AN UNSAVOURY TASTE OF SELF SERVING CLUB IN US AT THE TOP ACCORDING TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES EXECUTIVES IN CHINA HAVE ADMITTED THEIR COUNTRY'S STEEL SECTOR WILL STILL HAVE MUCH MORE CAPACITY THAN IT NEEDS AFTER A PLANNED RESTRUCTURING THE PAPER SAYS
THAT SUGGESTS THERE'LL BE NO LET UP FOR PLANT CLOSURES AND JOB LOSSES ACROSS THE GLOBE IN THE WORST CRISIS FACING THE INDUSTRY IN FIFTY YEARS SPEAKING TO THE F.T. THEY HAD OF AMERICA'S BIGGEST HE'LL MAKE A U.S. STEEL HAS ACCUSED THE U. N. U. K. HAVE BEEN NEGLIGENT IN THEIR APPROACH TO CHINESE DUMPING OF CHEAP STEEL MARIO LONGING SAYS OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN NAIVE AND ARE NOW PAYING THE PRICE FOR ACCOMMODATING CHINA
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE EQUALITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION TREVOR PHILLIPS HAS WRITTEN AN ARTICLE FOR THE DAILY MAIL CLAIMING THAT BRITISH MUSLIMS ARE BECOMING A NATION WITHIN A NATION HE ARGUES THAT HOUSING ESTATE SHOULD BE MONITORED TO PREVENT THEM BECOMING MUSLIM GHETTOS AND SAYS SCHOOLS MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER A FIFTY PERCENT LIMIT ON MUSLIM OR OTHER MINORITY PUPILS TO ENCOURAGE SOCIAL INTEGRATION
USING FINDINGS FROM THE SURVEY CARRIED OUT FOR CHANNEL FOUR DOCUMENTARY MY PHILIP SAYS EXTREMIST IDEAS HAVE FLOURISHED WHILE POLITICIANS CLAIM ONLY A TINY MINORITY HOLD DANGEROUS FLUES AND HE HAD A GUN IN THE EXPRESS WARNS READERS IL WANTS CONTROL OF YOUR PENSION ON THE EUROPEAN UNION IS PLANNING A POWER GRAB FOR THE U.K. WELFARE STATE THE PAPER SAYS IN A BID TO TAKE CONTROL OF PENSIONS BENEFITS IN THE MINIMUM WAGE
SENIOR EURO M.P.S ARE SAID TO FEAR THAT BRUSSELS IS PLANNING A SOCIAL UNION BUT THE LEGISLATION IS BEING HELD BACK UNTIL AFTER JUNE'S REFERENDUM THE PRIME MINISTER WRITES IN DEFENCE OF E.U. MEMBERSHIP IN THE EYE NEWSPAPER REALITIES THAT MEMBERSHIP GIVES AS ECONOMIC SECURITY AND HELPS KEEP US SAFE THE SON THINKS IT'S A FARCE THAT A SCOTTISH PAPER HAS BEEN ABLE TO NAME THE CELEBRITY WHO'S BEEN GRANTED AN INJUNCTION PREVENTING PUBLICATION OF DETAILS ABOUT AN EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR OCH AYE THEY KNOW THAT'S THE FRONT PAGE
THE TIME IS CALLED THE MAIN HEADLINE DAVID CAMERON IS GOING TO FACE FURTHER SCRUTINY OF HIS FINANCIAL AFFAIRS TODAY WHEN HE APPEARS IN THE COMMONS TO ANNOUNCE NEW MEASURES TO TACKLE TAX EVASION THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY'S ASKING FOR THE UNITED NATIONS TO INVESTIGATE THE SHOOTING BY ISRAELI SOLDIERS OF A YOUNG MAN WHO'D APPARENTLY CARRIED OUT A STABBING ATTACK ON A MILITARY PATROL IN THE WEST BANK CITY OF HEBRON
THEY SAY THE DEATH OF AB ABID AL FATTER AL SHARIF SHOWS THAT ISRAELI TROOPS ARE CARRYING OUT SUMMARY EXECUTIONS ISRAELI ARMY SAYS IT HAS HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS AND HAS ARRESTED THE SOLDIER WHO MAY BE CHARGED THIS WEEK BUT HE'S READY LIBERALS ARE WORRIED AT THE POLES WHICH SHOW STRONG PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE SOLDIERS ACTIONS OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CONNELLY REPORTS ON THE NATIONAL DEBATE
IT IS A FAMILIAR SCENE BUT IT STILL HAS THE POWER TO SHOCK IT BEGINS IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN ATTEMPTED STABBING IN HEMP ISRAELI SOLDIERS MILLING AMBULANCES MANOEUVRING THE PALESTINIAN ATTACKERS SHOT AND APPARENTLY GRAVELY INJURED ON THE GROUND THE INJURED MAN'S HEAD MOVES SLIGHTLY THEN
ONE ISRAELI SOLDIER HANDS HIS HELMET CALMLY TO A COMRADE RAISES HIS RIFLE TO COQUET AND THEN FIRED A SINGLE SHOT INTO THE HEAD OF THE PALESTINIAN
THERE'S NO SHOUT OF ALARM OR WARNING TO EXPLAIN WHY HE DOES IT NO ONE AT THE SCENE RESPONDS AS THE PALESTINIAN BEGINS BLEEDING HEAVILY FROM WHAT IS NOW A FATAL HEAD INJURY
THE SOLDIERS IN CUSTODY FACING CHARGES COLONEL PETER LEARNER OF THE I.D.F. SAYS HIS ARMY HAS CLEAR HUMANITARIAN RULES COVERING THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THEY'VE BEEN BROKEN IT WAS QUITE CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING OUT OF ORDER THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS IS DEFINITELY A BREACH OF I.D.F. CONDUCT AND THAT WAS WHY THEY REPORTED IT IN SUCH A WAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT WE HAVE
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS TREATED ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY PALESTINIANS ATTACKERS IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES SO OUR WE EXPECT EVEN IF THEY'VE BEEN SHOT
MILITARY MEDICAL FORCES SHOULD TREAT THE ATTACKER THAT IS THE NORM THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN DONE
IT WAS NO SURPRISE PERHAPS TO SEE RIGHT WING ISRAELIS PROTESTING OUTSIDE THE COURT WHERE THE ACCUSED TOLD YOU FIRST
BUT SOME LIBERALS HERE ARE A LONG THAT OPINION POLL SUGGESTING THAT HIS ACTIONS HAVE MUCH WIDER SUPPORT AMONG ISRAEL'S JEWISH POPULATION OVER EIGHTY PER CENT IN ONE SERVICE
AND SEE THE SOLDIER AS A HERO AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS LIKE THAT SELL HIM WHICH PRODUCED A VIDEO AS AN ENEMY WITHIN
YOU KNOW I DON'T LOSE SLEEP OVER BEING CALLED THE TRAITOR WHAT I DO LOSE SLEEP OVER IS WELL WHETHER WE'VE DONE ENOUGH EVERY DAY IN OUR WORK TO EXPOSE THE WRONGS THE HARM OF THE OCCUPATION
SORRY MY HIGHLY OF HIM SO SHE WORRIES MORE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE PALESTINIANS AND TO HER OWN COUNTRY SINCE ISRAEL CAPTURED THE WEST BANK FORTY NINE YEARS AGO
THIS IS THE MEANING OF OCCUPATION OCCUPATION MEANS PLACING SOLDIERS IN CIVILIAN AREA IT MEANS
SOLDIERS FACED WITH PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE BE IT VIOLENT NON VIOLENT AND I THINK
WHEN ISRAELIS LOOK AT THIS INCIDENT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE VERY OFTEN MISSING IS THIS COMPONENT MY MUST HAVE A POOR IF SAT ELECTED SHOULD I'VE GOT SIR ISRAEL'S RIGHT WING POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN MANOEUVRING WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SKILL OVER THE CASE THE FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER OF THE GORE LIEBERMAN CAME TO COURT TO SUPPORT THE ACCUSED SOLDIER
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS BEEN LESS DECISIVE FIRST APPEARING TO CONDEMN THE SHOOTING THEN FACED WITH CRITICISM FROM THE RIGHT MAKING IT KNOWN THAT HE'D SPOKEN ON THE PHONE WITH THE SOLDIERS
ISRAELI LIBERALS LIKE THE HORRORS NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST R.E. SHOVE EAT WORRY THAT MODERN ISRAELI LEADERS LACKS THE MORAL CLARITY THAT HE SAYS THEIR PREDECESSORS BROUGHT TO SIMILAR CASES IN THE PAST
IF THE PRIME MINISTER NOW WILL NOT WAKE UP AND NOT REALISE THAT THROUGH OUR DARYL HISTORY HOLLERS SUCCESS WAS BASED ON HAVING A MORAL DIMENSION TO OUR POLICY IF YOU WILL NOT GIVE A STRONG MORAL STATEMENT TO THE NATION THIS IS NOT US
THIS IS NOT HOW WE DO THINGS THIS IS NOT HOW WE WAGE WAR THEY MAY THINK THERE IS A REAL DANGER
OF THE DURATION OF THE SLIPPERY SLOPE IS A VERY SLIPPERY STEEP SLOPE
ALL OVER ISRAEL HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE
THIS MUSIC WAS USED IN A PLAY ABOUT MILITARY MORAL DILEMMAS IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND USED AGAIN IN A SIMILAR FILM IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY
AS YOU LISTEN TO IT NOW THE CASE BEFORE ISRAEL'S COURSE WILL HELP TO DEFINE THE COUNTRY'S MOOD IN A NEW ERA
KEVIN CALMLY REPORTING FROM ISRAEL OVERTIME IS TEN PER CENT MOHAMMED A BRAINY WHO HAS ADMITTED BEING THE MAN IN THE HAT CAUGHT ON CAMERA IN THE BRUSSELS AIRPORT ATTACK AS TOP PROSECUTORS HE AND HIS FELLOW BOMBERS HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED AN ATTACK IN FRANCE NOT TO BELGIUM DAMIAN FROM ATTICUS IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN BRUSSELS DON'T WHAT ARE THE BELGIAN PROSECUTORS SAYING ABOUT WHAT ELSE THEY'VE LEARNED FROM HIM
WELL THEY THEY HAVEN'T CONFIRMED DIRECTLY WHICH WHAT WAS THE SAUCE FOR THIS CLAIM THAT THE THE ORIGINAL ATTACK ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO LAUNCH A SECOND FOLLOW UP ATTACK IN FRANCE THEY BUT THE INDICATIONS ARE THAT IT SEEMS TO BE LIKELY THAT IT'S COMING FROM THE QUESTIONING OF MOHAMMED ARE PRUNEY POLICE INVESTIGATORS HAVE MAGISTRATES HEAR SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE MONKS THE POOL
FACTORS IN THEIR INVESTIGATION MULTIPLE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE UNCOVERED HAD LED THEM TO THIS CONCLUSION THAT THIS GROUP OF MEN WERE PLOTTING AN ATTACK AND THEY THEY ONLY SAID GENERALLY IN FRANCE NOT ACTUALLY IN BELGIUM
BUT IT WAS THE INVESTIGATOR SAID THE SPEED OF THE INVESTIGATION HERE THAT CAUGHT THE THE GROUP BY SURPRISE WHICH MADE THEM SWITCH THEIR PLANS AT THE LAST MINUTE AND CARRY OUT THE ATTACKS THAT WE SAW IN BRUSSELS BUT HE HAS ADMITTED TO THEM THIS MAN THAT THEY HAVE ARRESTED THAT HE WAS THE MAN IN THE HAT AND THEY BELIEVE HIM
THEY DO YES AND IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE TAKING THIS CLAIM NO THIS IDEA THAT THE ATTACK WASN'T ACTUALLY PLANNED FOR BRUSSELS BUT FOR FRANCE VERY SERIOUSLY TO WE HEARD YESTERDAY THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER YESTERDAY AFTERNOON MANUEL VAL'S COMING OUT AND SAYING THAT THIS WAS
FURTHER PROOF THAT THE THREAT REMAINS VERY HIGH IN EUROPE AND IN FRANCE SPECIFICALLY SO THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES CLEARLY TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY TOO AND THE BELGIANS TO THE BELTS SHOULDN'T JUSTICE MINISTER SAID TO HER YESTERDAY THAT
DESPITE THE RECENT SUCCESSES IN UNRAVELLING THESE NET THIS NETWORK THAT IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE THAT ANOTHER CELL COULD APPEAR AT ANY TIME AND BELCHING HER TREMAYNE ON ITS CART SO ARE THERE PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE NAMED THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SO MANY ARRESTS AS YOU SAY IN RECENT WEEKS
NO BE AT THIS STAGE POLICE SEEM TO HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR OR ARRESTED ALL OF THE FIGURES THAT THEY HAD NAMED AND WERE SEARCHING FOR SO THEY BELIEVE THAT PRESENCE THAT AS FAR AS THEY KNOW
ALTHOUGH THOSE CONNECTED TO THE GROUP THAT CARRIED OUT THE BRUSSELS AND PARIS ATTACKS ARE EITHER DEAD OR IN THE ATTACKS OR IN CUSTODY SINCE
BUT OF COURSE THE IN THE COURT IN THE COURSE OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS WE'VE SEEN NEW NAMES EMERGE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN DAVID RATTUS THANK YOU
THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NEARLY A QUARTER OF CHILDREN REFER TO SPECIALIST MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN ENGLAND ARE TURNED AWAY THAT IS WHAT THE THINK TANK CENTRE FORUM TELLS US TODAY TANYA BRIAN IS HIS CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND T.V. PRESENTER AS WELL GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND THE AMAZING THING ABOUT WHAT THE SAME WITHIN THOSE FIGURES IS THE RANGE AND THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE THEY'RE NOT TURNED AWAY AND SEEING QUITE QUICKLY AND OTHER PLACES WHERE THAT THERE'S A REAL DISPARITIES
THERE'S A MASSIVE POSTCODE LOTTERY NOT JUST IN TERMS OF CHILDREN BEING TURNED AWAY BUT ALSO WE KNOW ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF CHILDREN WHO DO GET INTO CAM'S AREN'T GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT OR WHERE THEY NEED IT TAM'S CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THERE'S A CRISIS IN THE SERVICE AND WE KNOW THEY'RE SOME LAST YEAR THEIR FUTURE MIND REPORTS PUBLISHED BY NORMAN LAMB HIGHLIGHTED THE CRISIS THE HEALTH SELECT COMMITTEE HIGHLIGHTED THE CRISIS ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION WAS PLEDGED BY THE COALITION GOVERNMENT
BUT SO FAR THIS YEAR OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN LESS THAN HALF OF THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN AND HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY LOCAL PROVIDERS AND THEIR MONEY ISN'T RING FENCED SO STILL THE PROBLEM PERSISTS AND IT'S A GRAVE PROBLEM WITH REAL IMPACT ON CHILDREN AND FAN HUGE IMPACT AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WORKING IN THE SECTOR IS WAITING TIME SO THERE'S
MAX AND WAITING TIMES HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE KNOW THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE IT CAN VARY FROM FOUR AND A HALF WE WEEKS WAIT FOR TREATMENT TO TWO AND A HALF YEARS TO WAIT FOR TREATMENT WOULD WE ACCEPT THAT IN PHYSICAL HEALTH SERVICES OF A CHILD HAD A CANCER DIAGNOSIS WOULDN'T WE WERE HEARING THIS THE OTHER DAY SPECIFICALLY ON THE SUBJECT OF EATING DISORDERS WHICH I SUPPOSE FALLS INTO THIS ABSOLUTE WIDER CATEGORY AND THE POINT THAT WAS BEING MADE TO US ON THE PROGRAMME THEN WAS THAT THE CONDITION WORSENS
IF YOU DON'T GET TO IT QUICKLY AND THAT PRESUMABLY IS THE CASE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT CHILDREN MIGHT MIGHT TURN UP WITH THIS THE SCENE QUICKLY AND TREATED QUICKLY
THE LONG TERM SAVING BOTH IN TERMS OF THEIR SUFFERING BUT ALSO TURNS HER MONEY IS HIS GREAT SIGNIFICANT I MEAN IT'S AN EIGHTY FOUR POUND RETURN ON EVERY ONE POUND INVESTED IN CHARLES AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH FIFTY PER CENT OF ADULT MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM START AROUND THE AGE OF FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT BY THE EARLY TWENTIES SO GET IN EARLY BUT ONLY SIXTEEN PERCENT OF BUDGETS ARE SPENT ON EARLY INTERVENTION AND THE ISSUE IS IS THAT THE LONGER CHILDREN ARE LEFT THE MORE UNWELL THEY BECOME I MEAN IT'S A NO BRAINER
AND CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF WAITING TIMES WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THE CAPACITY IN THAT LESSER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO DEAL WITH CHILDREN THE THRESHOLDS FOR CHILDREN BEING TAKEN INTO TREATMENT HAVE GONE UP SO CHILDREN HAVE TO BE REALLY SEVERELY UNWELL THAT INCLUDES ENDURING SUICIDAL IDEATION IN OTHER WORDS YOU THOUGHT ABOUT SUICIDE OR PLANNED SUICIDE MORE THAN ONCE HAS THIS ISN'T ACCEPTABLE I SUPPOSE WHAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IS ACTUALLY THE RISK OTHERWISE THERE IF YOU SEE PEOPLE TOO EASILY IS THAT YOU MEDICALISED JUST THE PROBLEMS OF GROWING UP
WELL CHILD MEDALLIST MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE STAFFED BY MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM IT'S NOT JUST PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS SUCH AS MYSELF SOCIAL WORKERS AND OTHER KINDS OF THERAPISTS AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSES IT'S NOT ABOUT MEDICAL ISATION IT'S ABOUT A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF MENTAL HEALTH FUNCTIONING AND CERTAINLY WE ALL HAVE THE SKILLS AND THE CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CHILD HE WAS SHOWING DIFFICULTIES THAT NEED MINIMUM INTERVENTION OR ADVICE AND A CHILD WHO WAS SHOWING DIFFICULTIES THAT WE KNOW FROM AN EVIDENCE BASE
COULD BECOME LONG TERM AN ENDURING AND THOSE OF THE PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS MORNING TANYA BRIAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR A WEATHER FORECASTER MICK MILLER'S HERE REALLY GOOD MORNING A SLOW MOVING WEATHER FRONT FROM NORTHERN IRELAND WALES PARTS OF THE MIDLANDS INTO SOUTHERN ENGLAND AROUND TO START THE DAY IN STILL FOR MANY OF US HERE TO END THE DAY AS WELL IN SOUTH WEST ENGLAND THAT MEANS FOR CORNWALL AND DEVON ACTUALLY YOU'RE IN THE DRIER SUNNIER WEATHER HERE BUT FOR OTHER AREAS IN SOUTH WEST ENGLAND YOU'VE GOT CLOUD OUTBREAKS OF RAIN MORE PERSISTENT THIS AFTERNOON

B. C. THAT AT LEAST TWENTY ONE CHRISTIANS HAD BEEN KILLED DURING THE OCCUPATION BUT THAT RESTORING HARMONY AMONG FAITH'S REMAINED HIS GOAL
IT IS VERY POSSIBLE WE LIVED IT WE LIVE THE SITUATION FOR CENTURIES WE LEARNT HOW TO RESPECT EACH OTHER WE LEARNED THEY'LL BE LIVE WITH EACH OTHER WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER AGAIN IF WE HAD LEFT BY OTHERS
THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT AS A HIGH RANKING NORTH KOREAN MILITARY OFFICER HAS DEFECTED TO THE DEFENCE MINISTRY MINISTRY AND SOUL SAID THAT HE WAS A COLONEL WHO WORKED IN A BUREAU WHICH CARRIED OUT SPYING OPERATIONS AGAINST THE SOUTH IT SAID HE DEFECTED LAST YEAR BUT GAVE NO FURTHER DETAILS
THE FORMER DRUG SMUGGLER TURNED WRITER HOWARD MARKS HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MARKS WAS SENTENCED TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN ONE OF THE TOUGHEST PRISONS IN THE U.S. BEFORE BEING RELEASED ON PAROLE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY ENTITLED MY NICE CAME OUT A YEAR LATER AND BECAME A BEST SELLER HE ANNOUNCED HE HAD INOPERABLE BOWEL CANCER LAST YEAR

ON THIS VERY RARE OCCASION I'M NEARLY SPEECHLESS H. JUST BEAM HE'S BEEN A FANTASTIC WEEK OBVIOUSLY ON AND OFF THE GOLF COURSE MY WIFE GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD LAST TUESDAY IN WHICH ALLOWED ME TO COME HERE
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S JUST BEEN ONE OF THOSE CRAZY WEEKS WHERE YOU KNOW THINGS SEEM TO HAPPEN AS THINGS SEEM TO GO YOUR WAY DANNY WHEN THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IS IT TIME TO RE EXAMINE INHERITANCE TAX LAWS STRONG MCDONNELL SHADOW CHANCELLOR SAYS IT IS THEY WERE OVER THE PRIME MINISTER'S INHERITANCE FROM HIS FATHER SHOWS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM MY LONG SAYS OTHER SAY THE PROBLEM WITH INHERITANCE TAX ISN'T IT EXISTS AT ALL THEY CLAIM TO ITS ATTACKS ON MONEY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN TAXED
AND HEAD OF H. M. R. C. MIGHT WELL AGREE EDWARD TROOPERS JUST TAKEN OVER HIS EXECUTIVE CHAIR ABOUT TAX AUTHORITIES ONCE DESCRIBED TAXES LEGALISED EXTORTION HE IS NOW THE MAN OVERSEEING THE INQUIRY INTO THE PANAMA PAPERS WERE TALKING A MOMENT OR A SENIOR TAX LAWYER BUT FIRST A RICHARD BROOKS WHO WAS HIMSELF A TAX INSPECTOR AT H. M. R. C. THEN BECAME AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST FOR PRIVATE EYES AN AUTHOR AS WELL AS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT IS THE CASE FOR INHERITANCE TAX
WHAT WELL IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT REDISTRIBUTIVE TAX BRITAIN HAS AMONG SOME OF THE HIGHEST INEQUALITY IN WEALTH IN THE WORLD AND INHERITANCE TAX DRAWS A LITTLE BIT BACK AND WHAT ABOUT THE SUGGESTION THAT YOU HEAR FROM PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY IT'S ATTACKS AGAIN ON MONEY THAT IN MANY CASES OR HAS ALREADY BEEN TAXED
WELL MONEY CHANGES CHARACTER ALL THE TIME AS IT MOVES AROUND THIS THIS IDEA THAT YOUR W. TAXING INCOME IF IF YOU ALSO CHARGING HER SOMEONE DIES AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE SAYING THAT IF I GO AND SPEND MY MONEY IN A SHOP THAT MONEY THAT I'VE ALREADY PAID INCOME TAX ON THAT AND THE SHOPKEEPERS TAXED ON WHAT HE GETS THE PROFIT HE MAKES THAT THAT'S DOUBLE TAXATION IT'S NOT THE MONEY CHANGES CHARACTER
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHERE A LOT OF THIS MONEY COMES FROM IT'S TO DO WITH THE APPRECIATION OF ASSETS IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE MOST HARD EARNED INCOME IN THE WORLD ONLY A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF PEOPLE AND ASSETS PAY INHERITANCE TAX ONLY THAT THE VERY WEALTHIEST INDEED THREE PER CENT OF ESTATES ALSO PAY INHERITANCE TAX SO THIS ISN'T A CASE OF
SQUEEZING HARD HARD WORKING PEOPLE FOR YET MORE MONEY THIS IS JUST CRAWL CLAWING BACK SOME OF THE GROSS INEQUALITY THAT OUR SYSTEM THROWS UP AND YET IF IT'S UNPOPULAR ISN'T IT AND WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS IS THAT QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE THE POLE SEEM TO SUGGEST WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE IT TO GO AND I WONDER WHETHER THERE IS A CASE FOR JUST SAYING LET'S GET RID OF IT AND TAX PEOPLE WHEN THEY INHERIT MONEY TAX THEM AT THAT THAT TAX RATE WHEN THEY GET THE MONEY
THERE'S CERTAINLY A CASE FOR REFORMING IT FOR DOING IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY PERHAPS TAXING THE BENEFICIARIES RATHER THAN THE ESTATE'S TAXING CAPITAL AND WEALTH DURING PEOPLE'S LIFETIMES MORE BECAUSE THIS INHERITANCE TAX DOES COME FULL OF LOOPHOLES AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE IN THE CASE THE PRIME MINISTER'S INHERITANCE SO YEAH THERE'S CERTAINLY A CASE FOR REFORMING THE MECHANISM AT THE PRINCIPLE OF ACTUALLY CRAWLING BACK SOME
WEALTH AND ADDRESSING SOME OF THE THAN THE KIND OF ALMOST NATURAL TENDENCY TOWARDS INEQUALITY WITHIN OUR SOCIETY IS I THINK ACE IS STILL VERY STRONG RICHARD BROOKS THANKS LET'S TURN TO GRAHAM AARONSON WHO AS A PARTNER AND JOSEPH HAGUE ARAN SO MUCH AS A SPECIALIST TAX LAW FIRM MYSELF LET A GOVERNMENT REVIEW OF THESE MATTERS AND IS ON THE LINE A GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING IS THERE A CASE AGAINST INHERITANCE TAX
I TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I WASN'T EXPECTING A DISCUSSION ABOUT SUCH MASSIVE ISSUES AS WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE WEALTH TAX OR A GIFT SACKS IN THE TIME I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE FIELD OF TAX WE'VE HER DEATH DUTIES CAPITAL TRANSFER TAX NOW INHERITANCE TAX
IT THIS IS A SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ISSUE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ESTATE DUTY AS IT WAS CAPITAL TRANSFER TAX AS A BECAME INHERITANCE TAXES AT NADIA'S HAS NOT BEEN POPULAR
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE BIG ISSUE FOR TODAY IS NOT WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE A ROOT AND BRANCH CHANGE OF THE WAY IN WHICH WE TAX PEOPLE THAT WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE TO CALL AS A TAX DODGE
THE GIVING OF A GIFT MY LADY TO HER SON OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT'S A MORE BURNING ISSUE IN ANALYSIS IN A SENSE HAS A MUCH MUCH A SMALLER OR THE DEAL WITH THAT IF YOU WANT TO FIRST AND THEN WE'LL GET IT WHEN I THINK WHAT THE CAMERONS IS PLAIN LEMON I DON'T KNOW ANYONE SERIOUSLY SUGGESTING WAS THAT WEREN'T DODGES AND UNPLEASANT ONE IT WAS PERFECTLY LEGAL AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE
DO YOU GUYS KNOW MINIMISE THE OWNER TAX NO BUT THE WORD DODGER'S BEEN USED IN ONE HALF INCH HIGH HEADLINES AND IF I CAN EXPLAIN COS THIS IS AN AREA WHERE I DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE AND POSSIBLY SOME EXPERTISE WAS I'D LED TO COMMITTEES THAT HAVE DISCUSSED THE CONCEPTS AND THE RULES RELATING TO
TAX AVOIDANCE AND IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL JUST TO STAND BACK AND SAY WHAT DO WE MEAN BY TAX AVOIDANCE AND AS YOU HAVE JUST SAID OF COURSE WE'RE DEALING WITH TRANSACTIONS WHICH ARE COMPLETELY LEGAL AND IT ISN'T THE ISSUE THE ISSUE WHEN ONE TALKS ABOUT TAX AVOIDANCE IS WHETHER SOMETHING ALTHOUGH LEGAL IS DODGY A BIT SMELLY
WHAT'S THE CRITERION TO TEST TESTIS BOTH COMMITTEES THE DIVE CHAIRS AND THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LEARNT HAVE ADOPTED A VERY SIMPLE WORKING PRINCIPLE
THAT'S A COURSE OF CONDUCT WHETHER LEGAL OR NOT LET'S ASSUME IT MUST BE LEGAL THE COURSE OF CONDUCT THAT IS ENTIRELY LEGAL BUT IS CONTRARY TO WHAT PARLIAMENT WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TAXPAYERS TO DO THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS TAX AVOIDANCE
SOMETHING THAT PARLIAMENT DIDN'T INTEND IT'S LEGISLATION TO BE USED IN THAT WAY WHEN YOU TEST WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE CAMERA SAFA AS INHERITANCE TAX THIS GIFT IS CONCERNED THERE IS
ONLY ONE POSSIBLE WAY OF DESCRIBING IT IT'S NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DODGY THIS IS JUST SIMPLY WHITE AND I CAME HER MAJESTY EXPLAIN MIGHT JUST FOR ONE WHICH IS VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE I MEAN TO BE BUT IT'S SLIGHTLY OFF THE SUBJECT
GO AHEAD IF YOU WANT BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT'S OFF THE SUBJECT I DON'T WANT TO SORT OF CROSS SWORDS WITH YOU BUT THIS IS THE SUBJECT THAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT NO BUT BUT BUT THERE THE SHOAL IN THE POINT IS THAT LABOUR ARE SAYING WE NEED TO LOOK AGAIN AT INHERITANCE THAT'S NOT THE CAMERONS INHERITANCE THANK YOU THEY DELIBERATELY NOT PERSONALISED IT THEY SAY WE NEED TO LOOK AGAIN AT INHERITANCE TAX POTENTIALLY WITH A VIEW TO TIGHTENING IT THAN WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM RICHARD BROOKS IS THAT THERE A DECENT REASONS WHY WE HAVE THE TAX AND WHY WE POSSIBLY SHOULD TIGHTKNIT AND WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN IS THE OPPOSING VIEW IF INDEED YOU HAVE AN OPPOSING
WELL THE PUBLIC CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO TIGHTEN AS I UNDERSTAND IT LAST YEAR OR TWO AGO AND HER MISTER GORDON BROWN CALLED OFTEN ELECTION AND BECAUSE OF THE TORY DECISION TO RAISE THE FOR THE THRESHOLD TO A MILLION SO INTERESTING HOW DOES MAKE YOU WONDER IF TIMES HAVE CHANGED OR NOT FUNDAMENTAL
WELL ONE I WOULD HAVE TH WELL BOOM THAT'S WHY A. WITH WITH RESPECT I THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THIS ISSUE OF DODGING NOT DODGING BECAUSE IF THIS IS REGARDED WIDELY IS NOT DODGING THEN THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE MEASURES TAKEN PERFECTLY LAWFUL MEASURES TAKEN IF THAT CAMERON'S TOOK RUFFLE MEASURES TO REDUCE AND HER CONTACTS HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF DODGE ABOUT IT IF THAT'S RIGHT IT MEANS THE PUBLIC JUST DOESN'T WANT THIS SORT OF THING NOW IN OTHER COUNTRIES YOU HAVE A WEALTH TAX
HOW DO YOU SEE HUGE POLITICAL DECISION YOU CAN HAVE A GIFT SACKS THAT PART THAT I PERSONALLY REGARD AS ANATHEMA I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL TO TAX PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE GENEROUS AND GET BEHIND AND MAKE GIFTS
BUT THESE THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER A WRONG ANSWER THIS IS SUCH A POLITICAL MATTER THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE A PARLIAMENT FOR TO THRASH THIS OUT AND I FURTHER POINT WHERE I MENTIONED EDWARD TROOP AT THE BEGINNING THEN THE NEW EXECUTIVE CHAIR OF THE TAX AUTHORITIES ONCE APPARENTLY DESCRIBED TAXATION AS LEGALISED EXTORTION I THINK THERE IS A PUBLIC VIEW ISN'T
THAT THOSE WHO DEAL WITH TAX I LIVE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD TO AN EXTENT AND IT WILL WORRY PEOPLE WEREN'T IT THAT THE BOSS OF H. M. R. C. HAS THAT VIEW OF TAX WHEN HE'S THE PERSON INTO THE PANAMA PUT WITH THAT WITH THE GRIP WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT IF HE SAID THAT I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT A STATEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN MORE OUT OF CONTEXT
OF COURSE YOU CAN DESCRIBE AS JUDGES HAVE THIRTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY YEARS AGO TAX THAT'S PUTTING A SHOVEL IN YOUR STORES AS EXTORTION I KNOW IT WOULD TROOP EDWARD TROOP HE'S THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH
THAT TAKES THE VIEW THAT TAXATION HAS ANY REAL PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO FUND PUBLIC ACTIVITIES FUND ALL THE EXPENSES OF OF THE STATES IT WOULD EDWARD TROOPERS A VERY SOUND BALANCE VIEW
I DON'T KNOW IN WHAT CONTEXT HE SAID THAT BUT NO I HAVE NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THAT COMMENT AND I DON'T SAY THIS WITH ANY DISRESPECT TO YOU BUT TAKING IT COMPLETELY OUT AND KNOW WHAT LIVES IN A DREDGER I'M BOUND TO SAY I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THE CONTEXT HE SAID IN THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE ON THEM PEOPLE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE ABLE TO LOOK IT UP AT THE CROWN ANSWER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THIS MORNING RICHARD BROOKS AS WELL
EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE IS A LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE FOR THE SOUL OF BRITISH ISLAM AND THIS IS NOT A BATTLE THAT THE REST OF US CAN AFFORD TO SIT OUT WE NEED TO TAKE SIDES SO SAYS THE FORMER HEAD OF THE EQUALITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION TREVOR PHILLIPS
IF I WAS A SURVEY OF ATTITUDES AMONG BRITISH MUSLIMS CARRIED UP BY CHANNEL FOUR THAT SUGGESTS THAT MANY FEEL VERY DIFFERENTLY ABOUT SUBJECTS LIKE TERRORISM GENDER EQUALITY HOMOSEXUALITY AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION FEEL VERY DIFFERENTLY THERE MOST OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC TREVOR PHILLIPS JOINS US HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SARAH AND YOU SUGGESTED ACTUALLY THAT THIS SERVICE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY'RE MUSLIMS ARE A NATION WITHIN A NATION YES I THINK THE E.
THE ESSENTIAL POINT ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS IS FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY WE HEAR BRITISH MUSLIMS SPEAKING FOR THEMSELVES RATHER THAN LEADER SPEAKING FOR THEM IT'S A SURVEY OF THE WHOLE NATION AT A COMPARABLE SURVEY ON THESE ISSUES AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT A FOUR FOR THE WHOLE FOR MUM WASN'T WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT BRITISH MUSLIMS THEY LOVE BRITAIN
THEY ARE ODD PATRIOTIC THEY ESPECIALLY PRIZE THE FREEDOM TO PRACTISE THEIR RELIGION AS THEY WOULD LIKE THEY TRUST THE AUTHORITIES IN THE WAY THAT I BECAME SLIGHTLY AS A SURPRISE TO ME BUT ON SPECIFIC ISSUES
FAMILIES SEXUALITY GENDER
ATTITUDE TOWARDS JUICE AND ON QUESTIONS OF VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF BRITISH MUSLIM OPINION IS SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF EVERYBODY ELSE'S OPINION
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT ABOUT WHAT THE SURVEY TOLD US AND YOU SUGGEST DANGEROUS
I THINK IN THE SITUATION FIRST OF ALL WHERE LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE ONE IN SIX
MUSLIMS SAY THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE SEPARATELY A QUARTER WOULD LIKE TO LIVE UNDER SHARIA LAW IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE AS A SOCIETY A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE DO WHAT WE'VE ALSO FOUND IS THAT THERE IS A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THIS DESIRE TO LIVE SEPARATELY
AND SYMPATHY FOR TERRORISM PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE SEPARATELY ABOUT TWICE AS LIKELY TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE SYMPATHY FOR TERRORIST ACTS AND I THINK ANYBODY
ANYBODY INCLUDING MOST PEOPLE IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY WOULD FIND THAT EXTREMELY WORRYING O. K. WHICH IS WHY YOU SAY EVERYONE NEEDS TO TAKE SIDES CORRECT HOW WELL WELL I THINK WHAT WE WHAT WE FOUND IN TALKING TO MUSLIMS IS THAT THERE IS A CURRENT OF WHAT
PEOPLE WOULD CALL LIBERAL MUSLIM OPINION SAYS THAT ACTUALLY WASN'T GOING TO FIND A FORM OF ISLAM THAT IS COMPLETELY COMPATIBLE WITH BRITISH LIFE AND SO ON
THOSE PEOPLE THINK OF THEMSELVES AS A VERY SMALL MINORITY NOW WITHIN MY NOTARY NURSE SURVEY SAYS THAT MAYBE FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE MUSLIMS BELONG TO THAT GROUP AND THEY FEEL THAT THEY ARE DWINDLING WHAT THEY WANT IS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE NOT TO STAND ON THE SIDELINES AND LOOK AT IT AS A KIND OF
STRUGGLE WITH BEING IN SEPARATE COMMUNITY WHICH IS WHAT I THINK IT FEELS LIKE AT THE MOMENT BUT TO SAY AS A COMMUNITY
WE THINK THAT VALUES THE QUALITY OF WOMEN RESPECT TOWARDS PEOPLE EXPECTED WITH THEIR SEXUALITY IS SOMETHING WHICH RUN THROUGH THE WHOLE OF BRITISH SOCIETY NOT BE CONFINED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT MUSLIMS THERE IS A NERVOUSNESS ABOUT THAT NOT LEAST FOR EXACTLY THE REASON THAT PEOPLE YOU SAY MUSLIMS ENJOY DIFFERENT LIKE THE FACT THEY HAVE FREEDOM TO PRACTISE THEIR RELIGION WHICH IS WHAT ANYBODY OF RELIGION WHICH WHAT CHRISTIANS WOULD SAY IS
THEY HAVE THAT FREEDOM AND POSSIBLY IT'S NOT FOR EXAMPLE FOR A CHRISTIAN CASE SOME MUSLIM PERSON TO DECIDE HOW THEY SHOULD RULE IT SO THAT'S THE SENSITIVITY HOW DO YOU GET ROUND THAT FROM BOTH POP BOTH WELL I THINK THAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE SENSITIVITIES ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT LET'S BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THERE ARE SOME THINGS WHICH IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT YOUR CULTURAL SENSITIVITY MIGHT BE SHOULD STAND
TRUE IN EVERY PART OF BRITAIN IN EVERY COMMUNITY FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL EQUALITY OF WOMEN RESPECT FOR PEOPLE IRRESPECTIVE OF RACE OR SEXUALITY THESE ARE VALUES AND BEHAVIOURS THAT ARE TRUE FOR EVERYBODY BY THE WAY I SHOULD SAY
THE YOU COME FROM AFRICA BEING COMMITTEE HAS WHAT MOST PEOPLE REGARD AS PRETTY BACKWARD ANTEDILUVIAN ATTITUDES TOWARDS HOMOSEXUALITY AS A SOCIETY WE'VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT THAT
IF YOU HAVE THOSE YOU KEEP ON YOUR HEAD BUT YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THEM PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND I MYSELF OR PROSECUTED PEOPLE OF MY OWN BACKGROUND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE MORE NERVOUS I THINK ABOUT MUSLIMS BECAUSE WE FEEL PEOPLE WILL BE OFFENDED IT'S LARGE GROUP BUT MY VIEW IS LOOKING AT THE RESULTS OF THIS SURVEY WHICH I HAVE TO SAY SURPRISED ME THAT WE HAVE GONE BEYOND THE SITUATION WHERE WE CAN SAY O.K. DON'T WORRY THEY'LL COME ROUND IN TIME COS THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WE HAVE TO MAKE THINGS CHANGE NOW
TREVOR PHILLIPS THANK YOU VERY MUCH TREVOR PHILLIPS CHATTER DOCUMENTARY ON CHANNEL FOUR ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHAT BRITISH MUSLIMS REALLY THINK TEN O'CLOCK

SAYS THE NUMBER OF TIGERS IN THE WILD HAS INCREASED AFTER DECADES OF DECLINE IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE FIGURE HAS SHOWN HER RICE
THANK YOU TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT AMID ALL THE HIGH PROFILE CASES OF PEOPLE BEING ACCUSED OF CHILD ABUSE AND THEN SAYING THE WHOLE MATTER DROPPED OTHER MANY MORE CASES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE ABOUT WHO WE NEVER HEAR HAVING PRETTY MUCH THE SAME EXPERIENCE
WE WERE HEARING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME THE PROPORTION OF CASES DROPPED WHEN THEY GET TO THE CROWN COURT IS THAT A FIVE YEAR HIGH HE'S NOT A SIGN OF SOMETHING GOING WRONG HAS THE PENDULUM SWUNG TOO FAR WE USED NOT TO BELIEVE THE VICTIMS NOW TO THE POLICE AND THE PROSECUTORS TRY TOO HARD TO FIND EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THEM AND DISREGARD ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T FIT THIS NARRATIVE PARTICULARLY IN CASES
INVOLVING CHILDREN I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A MAN WE'RE CALLING HIM PETER HIS RESPONSES ARE VOICED BY AN ACTOR ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS HAPPENED TO HIM
I WAS MARRIED FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS THE MARRIAGE BROKE DOWN BECAUSE OF ATTEMPTED AFFAIRS ON BOTH SIDES IT WAS QUITE A BITTER DIVORCE SO YOU WERE SEEING HER KIDS REGULARLY AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED GREAT ISSUES FEW MINOR DOMESTIC DISAGREEMENTS WITH MY WIFE WITH MY KIDS LIKE ANY FAMILY TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO NOW I HAD A PETTY ARGUMENT WITH MY EX WIFE THAT ESCALATED OUT OF ALL PROPORTION AS THESE THINGS DO
BUT ARE BASICALLY ABOUT PARENTING STYLE IT WAS THE KIDS ARGUING I GAVE MY DAUGHTER AN ULTIMATUM YOU BEHAVE OR ELSE SORT OF THING SHE CONTACTS HER MUM AND IT BLOWS UP OUT OF ALL PROPORTION
AND IT ESCALATED PETER SAYS THAT SIX MONTHS AFTER HE WALKED OUT OF THEIR MARRIAGE HIS WIFE MADE THE FIRST OF WHAT HE SAYS IS A HISTORY OF FALSE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOUR WITH HIS CHILDREN NOT ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL IMPROPRIETY BUT ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD CRUELTY WE'VE SPOKEN TO HIS WIFE AT LENGTH SHE INSIST THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE AND THAT HE ABUSED HIS CHILDREN OVER A PERIOD OF SOME YEARS BOTH PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY
AFTER THE LATEST ARGUMENT WITH HIS WIFE NEW ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE AND THE POLICE GOT IN TOUCH TO SAY THAT HE WAS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR HISTORICAL OFFENCES OF CHILD CRUELTY WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES BEING TOLD WERE YOU CALLED IN WHAT DID THEY COME AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN SO ME
THE FIRST THING I SAID WAS I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS PETER SAYS HE'D BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE POLICE TO POINT OUT FALSE ALLEGATIONS HAD BEEN MADE BEFORE AND MIGHT BE AGAIN
SPECIFICALLY WHAT DID THEY ACCUSE YOU OF HAVING DONE THAT POINT I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU THEN FIND YOURSELF IN A SYSTEM I'M ACCUSED FALSELY ACCUSED OF A CRIMINAL OFFENCE
AND THEN WITHIN A WEEK NO MORE I WAS CONTACTED BY THE POLICE CHILD PROTECTION UNIT OFFICERS TO SAY WE NEED TO INTERVIEW UNDER CAUTION AS A SUSPECT IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OR TIME WAS ARRANGED TO ATTEND A POLICE STATIONS ARE VOLUNTARY ATTENDANT WHICH I DID
I TELL YOU IT WAS TRAUMATIC BUT THAT DOESN'T DESCRIBE IT THAT WHAT WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU AS YOU MADE YOUR WAY THERE WELL I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE
I THOUGHT THIS IT WILL BE DROPPED NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER BUT WHAT DID HAPPEN NEXT POLICE JUST SAID TO MY LAWYER IT'S A CASE OF CHILD CRUELTY
MY LAWYER SAID WELL THAT'S NOT DISCLOSURE WE KNOW THAT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS YOUR GROUNDS
WHAT'S YOUR EVIDENCE WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THEY REFUSED TO DISCLOSE ANYTHING SO SUBSEQUENTLY WHEN THE OFFICERS LEFT THE ROOM MY LAWYER SAID RIGHT NO REPLY
AND THAT'S ON LEGAL ADVICE WHAT WITH THE OFFENCES I'D RATHER NOT GOING TO DETAIL BUT BUT THEY WERE THAT YOU HAD PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED AT LEAST ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN THERE WAS AN ALLEGATION
THERE WAS NOT A SEXUAL BUT A PHYSICAL ASSAULT TO ONE OF MY CHILDREN THE CENTRAL ALLEGATION WAS OF CHILD CRUELTY BY PETER AGAINST ONE OF HIS CHILDREN BUT THERE WERE ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER ALLEGATIONS OF OTHER INCIDENTS AGAIN HIS WIFE INSISTS THEY'RE TRUE PETER INSISTS THEY ARE NOT
PETER SAYS HE PROVIDED THE POLICE WITH A FOLDER OF EVIDENCE THAT UNDERMINED THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM IT CONTAINED PHOTOS AND TEXT MESSAGES THAT HE SAID PROVED THAT HIS CHILDREN WERE IN A HAPPY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AT THE TIME TWO MONTHS WENT PAST AND I JUST FELT SO POWERLESS SO ISOLATED
HIRA WAS ACCUSED OF ACTOR HADN'T DONE
AND I THINK IT WAS SLOWLY STARTING TO SINK IN THAT I WAS IN A SYSTEM THAT I'D BEEN ACCUSED I THINK WE ALL KNOW OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL IN THE RESULT COULD BE
THERE ARE MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE YOU'VE CONTACTED THE POLICE THEY HAVEN'T RESPONDED EVENT GETS TO COURT ANOTHER THREE TO FOUR MONTHS WENT PAST
I HEARD NOTHING FROM THE POLICE IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATING THE EVIDENCE THAT I PUT TO THEM WHAT I WILL SAY THIS POINT IS IS THAT THE LAW IS VERY CLEAR ANY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS GOVERNED BY THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AN INVESTIGATION ACT NINETEEN NINETY SIX IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT THE POLICE MUST PURSUE ALL LINES OF INQUIRY THE POINT TO A SUSPECT AND AWAY FROM THE SUSPECT
IN LAYMAN'S TERMS YOU CANNOT CHERRY PICK THE EVIDENCE JUST TO PROVE YOUR CASE YOU'VE GOT TO BE FAIR
IF YOU'RE GONNA PUT SOME BEFORE A COURT YOU'VE GOT TO TREAT THEM FAIRLY I EMPLOYED AT MY OWN EXPENSE OR PRIVATE SOLICITOR I HAD HER RIGHTS TO THE POLICE AND IT SAID MY CLIENT HAS EVIDENCE THAT WOULD UNDERMINE OR DISPROVE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM WHAT HAPPENS THEN HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY COME TO CALL SOME WEEKS LATER I RECEIVED A PHONE MESSAGE FROM ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS ASKING ME TO CONTACT THEM
WHICH I DID AND I WAS BASICALLY TOLD OVER THE PHONE BUT THE C.P.S. HAVE DECIDED TO CHARGE YOU WITH CHILD CRUELTY
I COULD TALK TO YOU FOR HOURS ABOUT THE EMOTIONS THE SHOCK YOU DON'T FUNCTION PROPERLY IT'S A NIGHTMARE EVERYTHING YOU'VE WORKED FOR EVERYTHING IS SUDDENLY GOING DOWN THE DRAIN DID YOU TELL FRIENDS FAMILY HAD TO
I TOLD THE FAMILY FIRST THAT STRESS DEVELOPS AND AFFECT OTHER PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY IT'S TRANSFERABLE DID YOUR FRIEND STICK WILLY YEAH YOU FIND OUT WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE
YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE AND OF COURSE THE STIGMA AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE A THERE'S NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE ATTITUDE YOU START TO THINK PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT YOU DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THINK IF HE'S BEEN CHARGED THERE MUST BE SOME RELEVANCE TO IT SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED
SO I'VE BEEN CHARGED WITH A CRIMINAL OFFENCE
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO A LOCAL MAGISTRATE'S COURT AND ARE TERRIFIED OBVIOUSLY I PLEADED NOT GUILTY AND IT WAS REFERRED TO THE CROWN COURT I REQUEST SO WHAT HAPPENED IN COURT I'VE GOT THE TRAINING I WENT TO CROWN COURT WAS A SUSPECT IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL THERE WAS A BIT OF LEGAL DEBATE WHICH I WASN'T PRIVY TO ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON I WAS CALLED INTO COURT THE C.P.S. BARRISTER STANDS UP
OFFERS NO EVIDENCE AND THAT WAS IT THAT WAS IT THERE ARE A FEW LEGAL FORMALITIES I WALKED OUT WENT TO THE PUB AS YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW LONG HAD IT TAKEN FROM BEGINNING TO END FROM BEING ACCUSED
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN MONTHS NOW WHAT SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY LISTENING TO ALL OF THIS IS LOOK WE USED TO NOT TAKE CHILDREN SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY MADE ALLEGATIONS
WE CHANGED OUR MIND AS A SOCIETY AND THAT IS A GOOD THING AND ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN TOUGH FOR YOU THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OF DOING IT I DISAGREE I'M TRYING TO BE AS OBJECTIVE AS I CAN HERE
OF COURSE SOME DADS DO INJURE THEIR CHILDREN OF COURSE IT GOES ON WE KNOW THAT BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY TOOK THE EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU INCLUDING WHAT YOUR CHILDREN HAD SAID SERIOUSLY YOU'RE JUST SAYING ARE YOU
THAT THEY PUT MORE WEIGHT ON I THINK IN MY CASE THERE WAS NO ANALYSIS OF MY CHILDREN'S EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER BUT IS THAT
INCOMPETENCE OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE SOMETHING MORE SINISTER AS IT WERE A ABOUT PRESSURES ON THE POLICE FROM THE WAY WE FEEL ABOUT THESE CRIMES I SUSPECT
THERE IS A POLITICAL OR A SOCIAL PRESSURE YEAH IN THE LIGHT OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS POST SEVERAL WHY DO YOU THINK YOUR KIDS DID GO ALONG WITH IT BECAUSE LIKE ANY OTHER CHILDREN THEY LOVE THEIR MOTHER
AS A YOUNG CHILD UNITS AN ORGANISATION I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID
THERE ARE WAYS AND MEANS OF COACHING HER CHILD AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD GO AS FAR AS IT DID YOUR EX WIFE SHE NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD GO AS FAR AS THIS BECAUSE SHE'S USED THE FALSE ALLEGATION TACTIC BEFORE NOTHING EVER HAMSTER
VERY VERY FEW WOMEN END UP IN COURT ACCUSED OF MAKING FALSE ACCUSATIONS WOULD YOU GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU THAT ACTUALLY THERE SHOULD BE
A CHANGE IN THE LAW YES I DO
IT'S SUCH A COMMON TACTIC USED WHAT HAS IT DONE TO YOU IT'S AFFECTING MY MENTAL HEALTH I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH STRESS
IT AFFECTS YOUR REPUTATION DAMAGES YOUR REPUTATION PEOPLE THINK THERE'S NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE THEN OBVIOUSLY IT AFFECTS YOUR CHILDREN I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY EX WIFE SAYS TO THEM BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY WILL KNOW THEIR DAD HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING A CRIMINAL WHEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THAT WAS A PIECE OF AN ACTOR VOICING WHAT PETER TOLD US WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE FORMER CHIEF CROWN PROSECUTOR FOR THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND AT TWENTY PAST EIGHT IN THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE HAVE SAID ALL CASES ARE KEPT UNDER CONSTANT REVIEW AS THEY PROGRESS THROUGH THE SYSTEM IF NEW EVIDENCE COMES TO LIGHT A WITNESS DECIDES TO NO LONGER SUPPORT A PROSECUTION OR A CO DEFENDANT PLEADS GUILTY
THEN THE C.P.S. WILL REVIEW THE CASE AND IF THERE IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OR IF IT'S NO LONGER IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THE C.P.S. WILL STOP A PROSECUTION AND THE POLICE FORCE INVOLVED AS WELL HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE COMPLAINT MADE AND THE MATTER IS BEING INVESTIGATED

YOU TALK ABOUT FATE YOU TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES WITH IT IT'S JUST BEEN IT'S JUST BEEN A CRAZY CRAZY WEEK WHILE MY MA I HOPE BOTH OF HIS PARENTS REV AND STEPHEN WILL IT AND ELIZABETH WILLETT AS WELCOME MIND YOU BOTH
OH WONDERFUL YOU BOTH YOU MUST BE JUST DELIGHTED AND AMAZED
LOOK AT THAT DID YOU I MEAN IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS YOU DID YOU IT WAS WONDERFUL THAT HE WAS IN THE MASTERS AT ALL DID YOU WHAT WHAT DID YOU THINK ONCE HE WAS IN WHAT DO YOU THINK HIS CHANCES WERE
ALTHOUGH WE WE ARE THANKING GOT LOTS OF WALL STREET ALL INTO ITS WHAT WONDERFUL BUT ELIZABETH WHEN DID YOU REALISE
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD WHEN DID YOU LOOK AT HIM AND THINK GOODNESS HE IS REALLY RATHER GOOD AT THIS
AND THAT WAS AT THE AGE OF WHAT ELEVEN TEN ELEVEN AND SO BY THE TIME HE WAS IN HIS TEENS STEPHEN WAS IT OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS HE WAS MUCH BETTER THAN HIS PEERS
GOLF AND YOU KNOW I STOP PLAY HIM ACTING LIKE HE WAS EMBARRASSED DID YOU REALISE THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE HIS THING IS HIS CAREER YET EVERY WEDNESDAY MY WIFE USED TO ARGUE WITH ME OUT I'LL TAKE HIM TO A GOLF CLUB DROP THEY CAN LOOK AT EIGHT O'CLOCK YOU GET TOLD OFF TO KEEP THE MOSCOW IS THAT
WELL THAT'S THE THING ISN'T IT YOU DO FOR PARENTS IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE I SUPPOSE WHEN YOU'VE GOT A CHILD IS OBVIOUSLY VERY GOOD AT SOMETHING BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU'RE WORRIED THAT IT'S MAYBE NOT QUITE THAT GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE A CAREER OF IT I AM INDEED IT MUST HAVE BEEN TRICKY FOR YOU
THIS IN THERE WHEN YOU GOING TO SEE HIM IN A LITTLE BIT OF THIS YEAH WE'VE GONE BACK TO SHEFFIELD THIS SWEET WONDERFUL YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT CELEBRATING AT THE MOMENT IN THAT FIELD IN ANGLE YEAH YOU'RE OUT IN THE FIELD
IT'S O.K. WILL IT VERY NICE OF YOU TO TAKE THE TRAVELLERS TO TALK TO US THIS MORNING STEPHEN IT AND ELIZABETH WILL IT PARENTS OF DANNY THANKS
IT'S TEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US IN THE STUDIO HERE LONDON THIS MORNING IS BISHOP JAMES JONES GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING FATHERS ARE IN THE NEWS THERE'S THE WEEKEND REVELATION THAT THE BIRTH FATHER OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY WAS SIR ANTHONY MONTAGUE BROWNE A PRIVATE SECRETARY TO WINSTON CHURCHILL AND THERE'S BEEN THE SCRUTINY OF THE INVESTMENTS OF IAN CAMERON THE PRIME MINISTER'S FATHER WHO WAS A STOCKBROKER
BENEATH THE SURFACE OF NEWSPRINT THERE'LL BE STRONG UNDERCURRENTS OF THE MOTION FOR ALL CONCERNED THE TOUCH ON FAMILY FATHERHOOD FOR YOUR LOYALTY AND IDENTITY
THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE PUBLIC EYE CARRY ACROSS ON WHICH THEIR LIVES AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE CONSTANTLY UNDER SCRUTINY AND IS SOME WILL THINK THAT THIS IS THE PRICE THEY SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PAY FOR ACCEPTING OFFICE OR POWER BUT THE RELENTLESS INVASION OF PRIVACY COULD WELL DETER GOOD PEOPLE FROM STANDING FOR ELECTION
I'VE LOST COUNT OF THE TIMES I'VE HEARD PEOPLE DESPAIR AT THE POOR SLATE OF CANDIDATES OFFERING TO BE THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT IS THERE ANYONE WITH SUCH A SPOTLESS BACKGROUND THAT THEY COULD SEE OFF SUCH INTENSE MEDIA SCRUTINY
I'M CONSCIOUS THAT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES ADDS TO THE PRESSURE SO LET ME PONDER SIMPLY ON THE CONCEPT OF FATHERHOOD
NOT LEAST BECAUSE IN THIS CENTENARY SEASON THE FIRST WORLD WAR SAW THE BIGGEST LOSS OF FATHERS IN MODERN BRITISH HISTORY WHEN MORE THAN HALF A MILLION CHILDREN WERE LEFT FATHERLESS AND IN OUR OWN TIME WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FATHERS HAVE NO CONTACT WITH THEIR CHILDREN
DEFINITIONS OF FATHERHOOD IT DIFFICULT IN AN AGE THAT MELTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN THE LORD'S PRAYER JESUS PAINTS A PICTURE OF HER FATHER WHO GIVES US OUR DAILY BREAD FORGIVE US AND DELIVERS US FROM EVIL
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT HER MOTHER CAN'T ALSO BE PROVIDER FOR GIVER AND PROTECTOR BUT IT OFFERS A MODEL TO ANY MAN WONDERING WHAT HIS ROLE SHOULD BE WHEN FATHERING A CHILD
I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY MY CONTACT WITH PRISONERS THIS OFTEN WHEN AN OFFENDER BECOMES A FATHER THAT HE BEGINS TO BREAK OUT OF THE CYCLE OF RE OFFENDING WHEN HE FEELS THE UNSPOKEN HOPE OF A CHILD FOR HIM TO PROVIDE AND PROTECT
BUT NOT EVERY CHILD IS SO BLESSED EVEN JESUS IN THE LAST MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE FELT ABANDONED BY GOD HIS FATHER AND WHEN HE CRIED OUT WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME IT WAS THE SILENT PRESENCE OF HIS MOTHER AT THE FOOT OF HIS CROSS BUT CONSOLED HIM
IT'S WHY CHRISTIANS HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT CHRIST IDENTIFIES WITH THE FATHERLESS AND THE WIDOW FOR THOSE WHO NEED SOMEONE TO BE THERE PROVIDER AND PROTECTOR
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BISHOP JAMES JONES THE TIME EIGHT MINUTES
SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO SHOULD BE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TODAY IN EDINBURGH WILL BE STAYING AT HOME BECAUSE IT'S FEARED THEIR SCHOOLS ARE NOT STRUCTURALLY SOUND IT WAS FOX REALISED THERE WAS A PROBLEM BACK IN JANUARY WHEN A WALL COLLAPSED AT OX GANGS PRIMARY WHEN OTHER SCHOOLS WERE CHECKED THAT WERE ALSO BUILT UNDER THE SAME PUBLIC PRIVATE FINANCE CONTRACT THEY WERE FOUND TO HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY THAT WALLS WERE BUILT BUT THE DECISION TO KEEP SEVENTEEN SCHOOLS CLOSED AND WHEN MANY STUDENTS ARE SITTING EXAMS WAS ONLY TAKEN ON FRIDAY
AND IT'S POSSIBLE MORE SCHOOLS COULD BE AFFECTED WERE JOINED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CITY OF EDINBURGH COUNCIL ANDREW KERR GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THESE ARE SCHOOLS THAT WERE WHAT BUILT TEN YEARS AGO SO THEY'VE STOOD THAT LONG WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT COULD HAPPEN AT THEM
WELL IT WASN'T ORIGINAL PROBLEM THAT WAS IT'S CAUSING US A PROBLEM WE WERE TOLD ON FRIDAY THAT WAS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM DISCOVERED WHILST
FINISHING OFF THE REPAIRS THAT MEANT THAT SCHOOLS BUT BIT COULD BE OPEN ON MONDAY AND WE'VE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CLOSE THE SCHOOL'S WELL WE INVESTIGATE MAKE SURE THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE BOTH
SAFE AND WE CAN BE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GO AND SEE IF WE'RE TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION WHAT SORT OF PROBLEM ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURAL PROBABLE INTERNAL WALLS AND ALTHOUGH I'M NOT AN ENGINEER WE HAVE HAD IS AN INDICATION FROM ENGINEERS THAT THEY COULD NOT UNTIL THAN FURTHER INVESTIGATION ARE SURE THAT THE SAFETY OF THEIR CHILDREN
WAS POSSIBLE SO WE'VE AS I REPEAT YOU KNOW I HAD TO SHUT THE SCHOOLS UNTIL WE ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE BACK IN PAY SO YOU'RE LITERALLY WORRIED THAT THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS THEMSELVES COULD FALL DOWN BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT BUILT WELL ENOUGH
AND WE ONE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY ABOUT CHILDREN WHICH OF COURSE IS PARAMOUNT AND ALTHOUGH WE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND AND EMPATHISE WITH PARENTS AND CHILDREN ABOUT THE DISRUPTION THAT THAT CAUSES
WE FEEL THAT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WHAT CHILDREN'S MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE HAVE TO PUT KILL OFF JUST ON THAT PRACTICALITIES IT'S PRETTY DESPERATE MEASURE THAT LATE ON A FRIDAY EVENING WHEN THESE SCHOOLS ARE OPENING ON A MONDAY YOU HAVING TO SAY YOU HAVE TO STAY AT HOME TO SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT'S INDEFINITELY I MEAN CAN YOU PUT SOME SORT OF ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT TO PLAY SO THEY CAN GET AN EDUCATION
I'VE BEEN WORKING SINCE FRIDAY TO BE CONDUCT CONTINGENCY ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE GOING TO SIR PICK THAT FOR SOME OTHER SCHOOLS AS CONTINUITIES WILL BE IN PLACE BY THE END OF TOMORROW
HOWEVER UNTIL WE'VE HAND THROUGH SOMEBODY'S DONE AND ALL THE SCHOOLS WE CAN'T BE SURE OF EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL IN THAT CONTEXT
SO WERE KIPPING PARENTS INFORMED ON A DAILY BASIS THE CONTINUAL UPDATE THROUGH A WEBSITE
I MEAN MILT TO PARENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON ANY GIVEN TIME WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE BUILDINGS YES OF COURSE WE ARE YES RIGHT SO THAT WOULD BE THE THE CONTINGENCY PLAN IS FIND SOME OTHER BUILDING IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN JOB THESE CHILDREN AND WE'VE HAD WE'VE HAD LOTS OF OFFERS FROM PARTNERS UNIVERSITIES OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND FIGHT SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT TO HELP US FIND THOSE ALTERNATIVES
SO EVERYONE AN EMBOLUS PULLING TOGETHER TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM AS MUCH AS WE CAN IT'S SCHOOLS THAT WERE BUILT UNDER A PUBLIC PRIVATE FINANCE CONTRACT WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING AT THIS STAGE OF WHAT WENT WRONG WITH
WELL AT THIS STAGE I'M NOT SURE THAT ANYTHING WENT WRONG WITH THE PUBLIC PLAYER'S CONTRACT IN FACT UNTIL WE UM
BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT THE INVESTIGATIONS WE CAN'T BE SURE EXACTLY WHAT THEIR PROBLEM IS AN OLD NINETEEN SCHOOLS HOME AND IT APPEARS TO BE A CONSTRUCTIVE PROBLEM ANOTHER ONCE THE CONSTRUCTION THE BUILDING IT'S NOT BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO THEIR TO THEIR REQUIRED STANDARDS
AND THEREFORE WE HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE SERVICE UNDERTAKEN BEFORE WE CAN SHOOT THAT FACT RIGHT SO IT WAS IT WAS THE CONTRACTOR WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE BUILDING OF ALL THESE SCHOOLS WHO BASICALLY DID SOMETHING WRONG THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE AT THE MOMENT SO WHO END UP WHO ENDS UP WITH THE BILL FOR THE REPAIRS AND SORTING IT OUT
WELL THE ONE THING FOR CERTAIN IS THAT THE THANKS BIT WON'T WE MEN HAVE HAD A CLEAR THING ENDOSCOPE AUNT AUNTS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THESE BUILDINGS THAT WE EXPECT THEM TO FULLY FINANCE ANY CONTINGENCIES THAT WE HAVE TO PUT IN PLACE AND ANY REPAIRS TO THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE POSSIBLE YOU MENTIONED NINETEEN SCORES I KNEW OF SEVENTEEN AND A COMMUNITY CENTRE BUT THERE MAY EVEN BE MORE THAN THAT WHEN OTHER AREAS ARE LOOKED INTO
WELL I I CAN'T REALLY COMMENT ON THAT OUTSIDE EDINBURGH BECAUSE WE ARE PUTTING WE'RE PUTTING AS MUCH EMPHASIS AND TRYING TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION
IT IS POSSIBLE OF COURSE THAT THE SAME KIND OF FAULT CAN IT COULD HAPPEN
WHAT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE ARE CONCENTRATING ON THE SKILLS THAT WE ARE WE'RE OFF I KNOW AND I UNDERSTAND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ANOTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE MAKING THE SAME CHECKS
RIGHT SO WE'LL ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS ARE SAFE RIGHT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WILL WE THINK THIS POSITION'S BEEN TAKEN ANDREW KERR THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE WEATHER AND THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT MICK MILLER GOOD MORNING THERE'S A WEATHER FRONT STRETCHING FROM NORTHERN IRELAND ACROSS PARTS OF WALES MIDLANDS INTO SOUTHERN ENGLAND STAY WITH OUTBREAKS OF RAIN HERE TO START THE DAY FOR MANY OF US IT WILL BE IN THE SAME PLACE TO END THE DAY AS WELL FOR SOUTHWEST ENGLAND THAT MEANS FOR CORNWALL AND DEVON YOU'RE IN THE DRIER SUNNIER CONDITIONS BUT ELSEWHERE CLOUD SOME OUTBREAKS OF RAIN MORE PERSISTENT INTO THIS AFTERNOON

IN A PARLIAMENTARY ANSWER LAST YEAR MY BERT SUGGESTED THE ONLY BEEN ONE SUCH DEATH RECORDED BY THE CARE QUALITY COMMISSION BUT THE DRAWING FROM ITS CASE WORK AND FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS INQUEST HE DISCOVERED AT LEAST NINE CHILD AND ADOLESCENT DEATHS WHEN INQUEST FIGURE WAS PUT TO ALISTAIR BURT HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW THE NUMBER ACCURATELY BUT WAS ADVISED IT WAS VERY SMALL
MY BERT SAYS HE'S SEEKING ASSURANCES FROM N.H.S.

LAST YEAR THE PROPORTION OF CROWN COURT CASES THAT RESULTED IN A CONVICTION FELL BELOW THE EIGHTY PER CENT MARK FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY ELEVEN A STUDY OF THE DATA SUGGESTS THE PRINCIPAL REASON WAS BECAUSE OF A RISE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES DROPPED BY THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE AFTER CHARGES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TWELVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN AN INCREASE OF ALMOST SEVENTEEN HUNDRED ON THE YEAR BEFORE
IN SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE DROPPED PROSECUTIONS THE C.P.S. OFFERED NO EVIDENCE IN OTHER WORDS THE CASE WAS DISCONTINUED AT A LATE STAGE AFTER THE DEFENDANT HAD PLEADED NOT GUILTY AND OFTEN AFTER MANY MONTHS AWAITING TRIAL
THE C.P.S.

ARE DUE TO BE SENT OUT TODAY IN ENGLAND THE DOCUMENT HAS COST MORE THAN NINE MILLION POUNDS TO PRINT PUBLICISE AND DISTRIBUTE NICK HIGHAM REPORTS
THE FOURTEEN PAGE LEAFLET SNAPPILY ENTITLED WHY THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT VOTING TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. IS THE BEST DECISION FOR THE U.K. FOCUSES ON THE ECONOMIC CASE FOR STAYING IN AND SETS OUT THE FACTS AS THE GOVERNMENT SEIZE THEM
CRITICS IMMEDIATELY CRIED FOUL SAYING TAXPAYERS' MONEY SHOULDN'T BE SPENT ON PRO E.U. PROPAGANDA AND ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT OF TRYING TO BUY VOTES BY LAST NIGHT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD SIGNED AN E. PETITION CALLING FOR PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE ON THE MATTER AND DISGRUNTLED EUROSCEPTIC CONSERVATIVE M.P.S MAY TRY TO RAISE THE MATTER IN THE COMMONS TODAY DELIBERATELY MAKING LIFE DIFFICULT FOR THE GOVERNMENT
NICK HYAM REPORTING IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE PRIME MINISTER MAY HAVE THOUGHT HE WAS DRAWING A LINE UNDER THE ROW ABOUT HIS TAX AFFAIRS WHEN HE PUBLISHED HIS RETURNS OVER THE WEEKEND BUT IT HAS PROMPTED MANY MORE QUESTIONS NOT JUST ABOUT HIS OWN DEALINGS AND WHETHER HE WAS AVOIDING INHERITANCE TAX BUT ALSO WHETHER EVERY POLITICIAN SHOULD NOW BE REQUIRED TO DO THE SAME
THE CHANCELLOR IS EXPECTED TO PUBLISH HIS WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS JEREMY CORBIN SAYS HE WILL DO THE SAME SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON IMMEDIATELY PUBLISHED HERS THE ONLY LEADER BUCKING THE TREND IS UKIP'S LEADER NIGEL FARAGE WHEN HE WAS ASKED HE SAID THAT'S A BIG NO SO DOES IT MATTER A REPORTER EMILY ASKED PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER'S DECISION TO PUBLISH HIS TAX RETURN
I THINK IF PEOPLE WANT US TO VOTE FOR THEM IN ANY CAPACITY THEN THEY SHOULD BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT THINGS SO PERHAPS FOR THE POLICE ELECTIONS THE CANDIDATES FOR THAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT YOUR SALARY YOUR TAX RETURN THAT KIND OF THING I WOULDN'T MIND AT ALL THAT I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TONIGHT AS THEY DO I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE PUBLISHED IT I DO THINK IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT WE ALL HAVE TO PAY TAX DON'T WAIT
WOULD YOU STOP AT POLITICIANS OR WOULD YOU SAY ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC EYE SHOULD BE OPEN ABOUT THEIR TAX AFFAIRS THEIR INCOME OUTGOINGS ALL THAT KIND OF THING YES THEY DO I REALLY DO I THINK THEY SHOULD BUY DEAFEN YOU WANT TO KNOW ME FIRST DO YOU JUST THINK HE'S A BAD GUY HE'S A POLITICIAN WOULD YOU EXPECT
AND SHOULD ALL POLITICIANS BE PUBLISHING THEIR TAX RETURN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BY A THOUSAND PER CENT MAKE IF WE'RE IF THERE IF TEX IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECONOMY THEY SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO DO SO LIKE I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE PEPPER DO
WHY I DON'T THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BASICALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY'RE ALL PRIVATE PEOPLE
PEOPLE OF BERKSHIRE THERE WE'RE JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY STEWART HOSIE AS DEPUTY LEADER OF THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY AMBER JACOB REES MOGG WHO'S A CONSERVATIVE M.P. AND ON THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH I'M A GOOD MORNING STUART HOW DID THE PRIME MINISTER DO THE RIGHT THING IN PUBLISHING HIS TAX RETURN YES I THINK HE WAS A PRESENT FROM ASIAN THEY'RE OWED TO INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IN THE PROBLEM WASN'T THEY TAXED ON THE PROBLEMS OF FOUR OR FIVE DAYS
TO ADMIT THEY'D BENEFITED FROM AN OFFSHORE TRUST AND FOR US IT'S LESS AN ISSUE ABOUT TAX RETURNS AND MORE A DECLARATION FROM THE CABINET IN ESSENCE SAY U.K. TAX POLICY
THEY HAVEN'T FOR BENEFITED FROM THOSE OFFSHORE TRUSTS BIGGER BUT THAT'S SOMETHING SEPARATE AND WHEN HE DID THAT WAS WHAT CAME CLEAN ABOUT THAT AT THE END OF THE WEEK THE CATALYST SOMETHING DEVON AND IMMEDIATELY NICOLA STURGEON PUBLISHED HAS WILL YOU PUBLISH OZ GO ON HAVE A DEAL OR THAT MAKE RATHER DULL READING COME IN DEVON AS ONE M.P. ENDS ON A MUCH TAX THE PAY
JACOB REES MOGG WILL YOU BE PUBLISHING SO I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO I THINK THE MOOD HAS BECOME VERY CLEAR THAT ALL M.P.S WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO WILL BE PUBLISHING THEIR RETURNS AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE HOLD OUT AGAINST THAT
AND THE ARGUMENT FOR DOING SO THE ARGUMENT FOR DOING SO IS THAT CAESAR'S WIFE MUST BE ABOVE SUSPICION THAT IF YOU ARE MANAGING THE COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS AND VOTING ON THEM THE ELECTORATE WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING IT PROPERLY AND INDEPENDENTLY I THINK IT'S A PITY THAT WE'VE LOST PRIVACY BUT TO SOME EXTENT IT'S POLITICIANS FAULT BECAUSE WE LOST THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC AS MUCH AS ANYTHING OVER THE EXPENSES OF HER YOU'RE NODDING AS YOU AGREE WE AGREE WITH THAT YES VERY MUCH SO AND THAT'S THE REASON WE'VE CALLED FOR THE DECORATION ON OFFSHORE TRUSTS
WE KNOW HOW THESE THINGS WORK A COMPANY SET UP IN THE BAHAMAS ADMINISTERED BY A PANAMANIAN LOYAL WILL BE BENEFICIAL OR NOT CAN HADE WEALTH AND THE TAX AUTHORITIES AND I THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT THE CABINET IN PARTICULAR
MAKE DECORATIONS THAT THEY DO NOT BENEFIT AND I'VE NEVER BENEFIT FROM A POTENTIAL CAME OUT WHEN YOU CAN HAVE YOUR SISTER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN ARGUE ABOUT A WEEK IS NOT A TRUST AT ALL IT WAS AN OFFSHORE FUND AND IT WASN'T ABOUT HIDING MONEY IN AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL IT WAS REGISTERED WITH THE H.M.R.C. IT WILL IT
FROM ALL THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD IT PAID ITS TAXES IT WAS QUOTED IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIS WAS NOT ABOUT HIDING MONEY INDEED IN THIS CASE IT WAS NO I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR I DON'T THINK DAVID CAMERON'S DONE ANYTHING WRONG LEGALLY AND AS YOU SEE I'M SURE BLAIR OR HAVE OBEYED THE LAW AS WELL BUT WE ALL KNOW FROM THE PALOMA PEOPLES THAT CONSTRUCT
A BUSINESS SET UP IN THE BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY ADMINISTERED BACK PANAMANIAN LAWYER CAN BE USED TO HIDE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP I'M TAXABLE INCOME NOT JUST FROM THE REVENUE FROM THE TAX AUTHORITIES ELSEWHERE AND VATS ISSUE WE ACTUALLY NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE I'VE MANAGED HIM SET UP INVESTMENT FUNDS OVERSEAS
THEY HAVE NO TAX ADVANTAGES FOR U.K. INVESTORS INDEED WHEN I WAS FIRST RUNNING THEM THEY WERE LESS ADVANTAGEOUS IF YOU PUT MONEY INTO AN OPEN INVENT ENDED INVESTMENT COMPANY OR INTO A UNIT TRUST YOU PAID TAX WHEN YOU SELL IT AND YOU PAY TAX ON YOUR INCOME EXACTLY THE SAME IS TRUE WITH AN OFFSHORE INVESTMENT TRUST SO WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT FOR GOING OFF THE ADVANTAGES IS THAT THEY'RE USUALLY FOR SOPHISTICATED INVESTORS THEY'RE NOT ON SALE TO RETAIL INVESTORS AND THEREFORE SUBJECT TO A LESSER LEVEL OF REGULATION AND RESTRICTION
AND WHAT YOU CAN DO SO YOU CAN DO MORE COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS BUT IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH TAX ANYWAY WE'VE BEEN ARGUE ABOUT THIS ALL OF LAST WEEK AT THE QUESTION NOW IS ABOUT HOW PUBLIC PEOPLE NEED TO BE BECAUSE YOU MAKE THE POINT YOU BOTH MAKE THE POINT THE PEOPLE DON'T TRUST POLITICIANS BUT SURELY WE SHOULD TRUST OUR TAX OFFICE AND IF WE DON'T IF WE WE WANT TO RELY ON CROWD SOURCING EFFECTIVELY TO TENT TO CHECK ON A
POLITICIANS TAX RETURNS THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF ANY PUBLIC FIGURE THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO WHERE DO YOU STOP WENT WHAT PUBLIC FIGURES SHOULD BE PUTTING THEIR TAX RETURNS ONLINE I THINK I JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION CAN I JUST DISAGREE WITH JACOB WE KNOW PERFECTLY WELL
THE CONFIGURATION OF BUSINESS MODE LIFE DESCRIBE CAN AND IS BEING USED BY PEOPLE TO HIDE WEALTH FROM THE TAX AUTHORITIES BUT WILL WILL HAVE THAT THERE'LL BE ANOTHER TIME WE HAD IT WE'VE HAD OVER DAY LET'S GET THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING TAX POLICY
IN ESSENCE THE CABINET THE OTHER ONES WE NEED TO BE MOST CLEAN AND MOST TRANSPARENT WITH THE PUBLIC BECAUSE WE CANNOT EVEN HAVE A PERCEPTION THAT THOSE WHO MAKE TAX POLICY CAN BENEFIT PERHAPS FROM TAX LOOPHOLES BUT WHERE DO YOU STOP BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT BE GIVING MONEY TO THEIR SPOUSE THEY MIGHT BE GIVING MONEY TO OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WHERE DO YOU STOP
WELL IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION I KNOW OTHERS HAVE BEEN PEOPLE SAME PERHAPS THE B. B. C. WHO ARE PLAYERS AND SOME OF THESE THINGS SENIOR BROADCASTER SHOULD NO I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES ANY SENSE I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE SENSIBLE YOU THE PEOPLE WHO SETTING CREATE POLICY OF THE ONES WHO NEED TO BE MOST TRANSPARENT IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE WHY YOU WOULD NEED TO GO BEYOND PARLIAMENT BUT I THINK THERE IS AN IMPORTANT POINT HERE
THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE TAX EVASION IS ILLEGAL BUT TAX AVOIDANCE IS NOT PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO ARRANGE THEIR TAX OF SPORT CLYDE FAMOUSLY SAID TO ALLOW THE INLAND REVENUE TO PUT THE LARGEST SHOVEL INTO THEIR STORES PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO USE LEGAL MEANS SUCH AS BUYING DUTY FREE OR I SAYS OR PENSION FUNDS NOT TO PAY MORE TAX THAN REQUIRED BY LAW THE RHEAS DIFFER FROM BUYING DUTY FREE WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS DONE
IT'S LESS THAN THAT COS IT HAD NO TAX ADVANTAGE AT ALL HE THE BLUR MORPHING IS NOTHING TO DO WITH TAX AVOIDANCE IT'S JUST AN INVESTMENT FUND BUT THE REASON POLITICIANS MAY THEREFORE WANT TO PUBLISH THEIR AFFAIRS IS THAT SOME PARTICULARLY ON THE LEFT ALIVE EVASION AVOIDANCE AND THAT'S BEEN A GREAT MISTAKE AND HE'S CONFUSED PEOPLE ABOUT THE TWO PUT OF VERSION IS ILLEGAL AND PEOPLE CAN GO TO PRISON FOR AVOIDANCE
BUYING DUTY FREE IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE ON THE LEFT BECAUSE WE HAD SENIOR POLITICIANS OR CHANCELLOR TALKING ABOUT WHAT JIMMY CARR THE COMEDIAN DID AS MORALLY REPUGNANT SO IT'S ACROSS THE VERTICAL SPECTRUM THERE IS NO MORALITY IN THIS QUESTION AT ALL IT'S A QUESTION WHAT THE LAW SAYS IF PARLIAMENT CAN'T PROP PAST PROPER LAWS THAT WOULD COLLECT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TAX THAT'S FALLED PARLIAMENT NORTH OF THE PEOPLE ARE PAYING THE TAX LAW
JUST ONE ONE FINAL THOUGHT WE'VE HAD FOR EXAMPLE NIGEL FARAGE SAYING NO WAY WHAT DO YOU WANT BOTH SUGGESTING THAT A POLITICIAN SHOULD ALL DO IT SHOULD THEY BE COMPELLED TO DO
NO I THINK THE PUBLIC WILL TAKE A FEW IF IF THE PUBLIC DEMAND ATTACKS OF DONNA'S PUBLISHED THAT'S PUBLISHED ONE THING IF THE POLITICIAN CHOOSES NOT TO THEN THE PUBLIC CAN DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS REGISTER OF MEMBERS' INTERESTS REQUIRES MEMBERS TO LOG THE INCOME THEY'RE RECEIVING THE OURS WORKED IT DOESN'T REQUIRE UNEARNED INCOME TO BE LISTED IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY REASONABLE FOR THAT TO BE CHANGED
JACOB REES MOGG STEWART HOSIE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH AND LISTENING TO THAT OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG AND IT DOES SEEM VERY MUCH AS THOUGH THE PRIME MINISTER IS PUTTING EVERYTHING OUT THERE SAYING LOOK LET'S DRAW A LINE BUT IT HASN'T WORKED YET
WELL IT HASN'T SARAH IN THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN A REAL HORLICKS TO BE HONEST AND IT'S ALL GOT TANGLED UP IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT TOXIC FOR DOWNING STREET TODAY WE'VE GOT THE P.M. TRYING TO BE ON THE FRONT FOOT BY TALKING ABOUT CRACKING DOWN ON CRIMINAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY TAX EVASION THEIR DEMAND STILL FOR HIM TO PUBLISH DETAILS OF SHEARERS HE HELD YOU KNOW NEARLY A DECADE AGO THERE'S A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TRYING TO MINIMISE INHERITANCE TAX AND FAMILIES IS UNSAVOURY BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE TWO BIG THINGS
ONE THAT QUESTION OF TRANSPARENCY THAT YOU'VE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING AND SECONDLY THE GRIP OF THE GOVERNMENT OVERALL ON TRANSPARENCY ALTHOUGH SOME THINGS THE M.P.S AND SOME M.P.S AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MIGHT THINK SEEM UNSAVOURY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SHOW UP IN A TAX RETURN IN ANY CASE IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE A BIG STEP ON THE JOURNEY TOWARDS MANY POPPED POLITICIANS MAYBE NOT ALL OF THEM BUT MANY OF THEM IN INCREASING NUMBERS WE'LL BE PUBLISHING THEIR TAX RETURN THE CHANCELLOR FOR EXAMPLE HASN'T MADE A FINAL DECISION BUT HE'S QUITE LIKELY TO DO SO
BUT IN TERMS OF THE BIGGER DIFFICULTY IN THE GRIP OF GOVERNMENT AFTER A REALLY BLOODY WEEK I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE REAL DIFFICULTY OF NUMBER TEN TRYING TO DO TWO THINGS AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO RUN THE NORMAL GOVERNMENT OF BUSINESS AND TRYING TO RUN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WHICH IS OF COURSE THE MUCH BIGGER PREOCCUPATION FOR THEM AT THE MOMENT
LAST WEEK TOOK A HUGE CHUNK OUT OF THOSE EFFORTS I THINK IT'S NOT JUST THIS QUESTION OF TAX IF YOU LOOK BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE BUDGET IF YOU LOOK BACK TO THE RESIGNATION OF IAIN DUNCAN SMITH I THINK ALL OF THOSE SHOWS HOW HARD IT IS AT THE MOMENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO GRIP THE Y. YOU CAMPAIGN AND ALSO JUST TO GET ON WITH THE NORMAL BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT WAS SO MISHANDLED LAST WEEK AND IT'S THE SORT OF DIFFICULTY OF POLITICALLY TRYING TO PACK THEIR HEAD AND RUB THEIR STOMACHS AT THE SAME TIME IT'S PROVING VERY HARD INDEED LAURA KINSBERG THANKS VERY MUCH
TIMES TWENTY PAST EIGHT WE HEARD AN HOUR AGO FROM A MAN WE'RE CALLING PETER WHO WAS ACCUSED OF PHYSICALLY ABUSING ONE OF HIS CHILDREN HE SAYS EVIDENCE HE PROVIDED TO THE POLICE SUGGESTING THAT THE ACCUSATIONS WERE FALSE WAS NOT PROPERLY CONSIDERED AND THIS WAS THE WIDER POINT THAT HE MADE TO US THERE ARE A FEW LEGAL FORMALITIES
I WALKED OUT WENT TO THE PUB AS YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW LONG HAD IT TAKEN FROM BEGINNING TO END FROM BEING ACCUSED
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN MONTHS NOW WHAT SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY LISTENING TO ALL OF THIS IS LOOK WE USED TO NOT TAKE CHILDREN SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY MADE ALLEGATIONS
WE CHANGED OUR MIND AS A SOCIETY AND THAT IS A GOOD THING AND ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN TOUGH FOR YOU THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OF DOING IT I DISAGREE I'M TRYING TO BE AS OBJECTIVE AS I CAN HERE
OF COURSE SOME DADS DO INJURE THEIR CHILDREN OF COURSE IT GOES ON WE KNOW THAT BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY TOOK THE EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU INCLUDING WHAT YOUR CHILDREN HAD SAID SERIOUSLY YOU'RE JUST SAYING ARE YOU
THAT THEY PUT MORE WEIGHT ON I THINK IN MY CASE THAT WAS NO ANALYSIS OF MY CHILDREN'S EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER BUT IS THAT
INCOMPETENCE OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE SOMETHING MORE SINISTER AS IT WERE A ABOUT PRESSURES ON THE POLICE FROM THE WAY WE FEEL ABOUT THESE CRIMES I SUSPECT
THERE IS A POLITICAL OR SOCIAL PRESSURE YEAH IN THE LIGHT OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS POST SEVERAL WELL IS WHAT PETER IS CLAIMING THEIR OR INDEED TRUE NO I'VE CELL IS THE FORMER CHIEF CRIME PROSECUTOR AT THE C.P.S. FOR NORTH WEST ENGLAND
OBVIOUSLY I HAD TO WIN A SYMPATHY FOR FOR HIM HE CLEARLY HASN'T BEEN GIVEN ALL THE INFORMATION IS I THINK HE'S ENTITLED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THE CHARGING DECISION AND THE DECISION NOT TO PROSECUTE HIM THAT WAS TAKEN IN THE CROWN COURT IF THERE WAS NOTHING THAT SAYS BETWEEN THE DECISION TO CHARGE AND THAT
DES IN THE CROWN COURT THEN I WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT THE ORIGINAL DECISION WAS WRONG IN SOME WAY AND HE NEEDS TO HAVE AS MUCH OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY HAD SHOWN HIM AS A SUSPECT THE COMPLAINT HAS IN TERMS OF THE CASE AS WELL BUT IT HAS TO BE SAID YOU SPOKEN TO BOTH PARTIES THEY BOTH STILL INSIST THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON AS REGARDS WHAT HAPPENED
THE PROSECUTORS AND DON'T OBVIOUSLY HAVE INSIDE KNOWLEDGE AND THEY HAVE TO RELY UPON THE EVIDENCE PROVIDED TO THEM BY THE POLICE IT DOES CONCERN ME THAT HE SAYS THAT HE PROVIDED A PHIAL OF UNDERMINING EVIDENCE CERTAINLY DOING MY TIME I WOULD MAKE SURE BUT ANY PROSECUTING WITH THE CASE WOULD LOOK AT THAT CHECK IT AND SAW THAT THEY HAD MADE THE RIGHT DECISION BASED ON INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE DEFENDANT OR THE ACCUSED
IT IS WORRYING FOR ME AND I SUSPECT IT'S WORRYING FOR MANY OTHERS THAT PERHAPS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON THIS OCCASION HE TALKED ABOUT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PRESSURE ON THE POLICE TO TAKE ONE SIDE MORE SERIOUSLY IN CASES LIKE THIS AND MEAN SADLY I DON'T ACCEPT THAT I MEAN WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE PRIOR TO TWENTY ELEVEN I DEALT WITH ROCHDALE AND PRIOR TO TWENTY ELEVEN JUSTIN HOOF COMPLAINANTS REALLY WERE TREATED VERY POORLY THEIR CREDIBILITY WAS SORT THROUGH WHAT WE ALWAYS DID AS PROSECUTORS
AND INVESTIGATORS WAS LOOK FOR UNDERMINING EVIDENCE THAT WILL UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE COMPLAINANT WE RARELY LOOK BEYOND THAT AND IT WAS ONLY THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE THAT WE BROUGHT ABOUT NAMELY THAT YOU LOOKED THE CREDIBILITY OF THE WHOLE ALLEGATION NOT JUST WHAT THE COMPLAINANT HAS SAID THAT REALLY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE AND YOU WILL SEE LATER ON THIS YEAR WITH THE BRITISH CRIME SURVEY THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ABUSED
SEXUALLY OR NON SEXUALLY AS CHILDREN AND WHO HAVE NOT HAD THE COURAGE TO BE TO REPORT OR BEEN BELIEVED WHEN THEY DID AND SO ONE HAS TO RECOGNISE THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AND WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS TO ME AND PEOPLE DO THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG TOO FAR PEOPLE HAD TO REMIND THEMSELVES WHERE THE PENDULUM WAS JUST FIVE YEARS AGO WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE BAYING CROWD MENTALITY YES THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD
A DESPERATE FOR CASES TO BE BROUGHT FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS AND A PROSECUTOR MUST LOOK AT IT IN THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY PROFESSIONALLY AND SAW THAT THEY RECOGNISE ANY ISSUES ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ALLEGATION AND MAKE THE DECISION THAT STANDS UP AND IT DOES CONCERN ME AS I SAID AT THE OUTSET THAT THIS CASE WAS DROPPED AND HE HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN A PROPER EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THAT WAS THE CASE IF THERE ISN'T SOME WAS WRONG POSSIBLY HIS NEED TO ADMIT TO THAT
IT WOULD BE USEFUL WOULDN'T IT TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THESE CASES GOT TO COURT THERE WASN'T EVIDENCE OFFERED IN SPECIFICALLY IN CASES THAT ARE TO DO WITH CHILDREN AND POTENTIALLY PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL OFFENCES AGAINST CHILDREN BUT THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE I'M NOT ABLE TO GIVE US THOSE FIGURES DO YOU THINK THAT THEY SHOULD
WE HAVE LEFT THE C.P.S. A YEAR AGO AND CERTAINLY WE WERE FLAGGING ARE YOU RECORDING ALL MANNER OF TYPES WHO SENDING AND ALL MANNER OF ACTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE IN RELATION TO A CASE I THINK WHILST I HAVE NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER IT'S VERY ONEROUS AND RARE RESOURCE INTENSIVE THAT'S KIND OF INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND CERTAINLY WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE PROSECUTOR'S THEMSELVES AT SENIOR LEVELS WILL BE LOOKING OUT TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TYPES OF CASES SO YES IT IS DOABLE AND ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WE DO LOOK AT IT BUT ONE HAS TO
REALISE THERE ARE ALL MANNER OF THINGS OR CAN CHANGE BETWEEN THE DECISION TO CHARGE AND AN ULTIMATE OUTCOME AND THAT COULD BE NOT IN THIS CASE THE COMPLAINANT WITHDRAWING IT COULD BE VERY OFTEN THIRD PARTY MATERIALS
BUT MY POINT IS THAT THE ACCUSED PERSON NEEDS TO HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION GIVEN TO HIM ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MAKE LIFE ANY BETTER FOR HIM BUT CERTAINLY GIVE HIM AN UNDERSTANDING THAT MAYBE JUST MAYBE THE DECISION WAS RIGHT AT THE OUTSET YES AND I SUPPOSE THE OTHER THING THAT WOULD COME FROM THAT FIGURE FOR THE CASES THAT ARE DROPPED AT THE LATE STAGE REGARDING CHILDREN
WOULD BE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WASN'T A KIND OF SWINGING OF THE PENDULUM THAT THERE WASN'T A BIG INCREASE IN THE NUMBER I AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR IN IN PROSECUTORS AND AND EVERYBODY IN FACT PROVIDING AS MUCH INFORMATION PUBLICLY AS POSSIBLE THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT CAN'T BE DONE IT AS A SAID IT'S RESOURCE INTENSIVE BUT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE IT'S ABOUT CONFIDENCE YOU ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE PENDULUM IS WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE I THINK THE BALANCE IS PROBABLY ABOUT RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S AND THAT MEANS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOW GOING INJUSTICE THAT WEREN'T GETTING JUSTICE
BUT THOSE WHO ARE ACCUSED AND THOSE CASES ARE DON'T PROCEED PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS THAT THEY AREN'T BEING PERCEIVED WITH THEM WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED OR SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM OR SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THE DIGGER INDIVIDUAL PROSECUTORS WHICH HAS MEANT THAT THIS PERSON HAS BEEN TRIED UNNECESSARILY
I WAS HALF SELL THE FORMER CHIEF CROWN PROSECUTOR FOR THE NORTH WEST OF INK

THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE A TATTER STEEL IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE THE DEAL ON SELLING IT'S SCUNTHORPE STEELWORKS TODAY IT'S A DEAL THAT IT'S HOPED WILL SAVE FOUR THOUSAND JOB SARAH CAULKER IS B. B. C. LOOK NORTH'S BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT AND JOINS US NOW FROM SCUNTHORPE GOOD MORNING SARAH
YES GOOD MORNING IT FOR SALE DOES GO THROUGH TODAY IT WILL COME AS A HUGE RELIEF TO THIS TAM AND YOU STOOD AT THE GATES OF A STEELWORKS NOW IT'S A SPRAWLING PLANT YOU CAN SEE THE COOLING TOWERS AND BLAST FURNACES THEY DOMINATE THE SKYLINE HERE
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR WORKERS ARE JUST ARRIVING FOR THEIR EARLY SHIFT THERE'S A STEADY STREAM OF CARS AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERESTIMATE JUST HOW IMPORTANT STEEL MAKING IS
EMPLOYS FOUR THOUSAND STEELWORKERS BUT IT SUPPORTS ANOTHER THIRTY THOUSAND JOBS IN THE WIDER ECONOMY AND THIS SO IT'S BEEN UP FOR SALE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WELL BEFORE TATA SAID IT WANTED TO OFFLOAD ITS ENTIRE U.K. BUSINESS
IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT TODAY AFTER MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS INVESTMENT FIRM GREY BALL CAPITAL COULD FINALISE A TAKEOVER DEAL WITH ME NOW IS POOR MCBEAN FROM THE COMMUNITY UNION
JUST TRYING TO SUM UP FOR US HOW MUCH IS IT STEAK FOR THIS COMMUNITY THE WHOLE OF THE COMMUNITY BASICALLY
THE STEELWORK SUPPORTS MASSIVE EMPLOYER
AND IT SUPPORTS NOT JUST THE WORKERS THEMSELVES WHAT THE CONTRACT FOR ETERNITY THE TOWN OR COMMUNITY IT IS A MASSIVE
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THAN CERTAINTY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS ABOUT THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THIS PLANT JUST HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO WE DEAL COULD IT HAPPEN TODAY WELL THE SALES AND PURCHASES AGREEMENT HOPEFULLY WILL BE SIGNED TODAY WHICH IS VIRTUALLY A DONE DEAL WELL THEN WAIT FOR THE BALLET OF THE MEMBERS
TO COME BACK JUST TO FINALISE THEM FINISH IT OFF AND THAT BALLET YOU MENTION THEIR WORKERS HAVE BEEN ASKED IF THEY WILL ACCEPT A THREE PER CENT PAY COOK FREE
A PENSION FREEZE TO HELP SAVE THIS BUSINESS WHAT HAVE STILL WORK IS SAID TO YOU ABOUT THAT
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A UNIQUE SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN BUT I THINK THEY'VE COME TO THE REALISATION AND I THINK AS A UNION COMMUNITY UNION
WE'VE MANAGED TO EXPLAIN THAT TO SAVE THIS BUSINESS THIS IS A TYPE OF SACRIFICE WE'VE GOT TO DO BECAUSE WE'VE GONE THEY STEAL THOSE AND THE LOCAL MANAGEMENT TEAM HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE YEAR
WE NEEDED A MASSIVE BELT FROM THE GOVERNMENT WHICH REALLY HASN'T BEEN FORTHCOMING REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY TIMES I'VE TRAVELLED UP AND DOWN TO
THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT HE'S BEEN DOING ALL IT CAN TO SUPPORT THIS INDUSTRY INCLUDING TACKLING CHEAP IMPORTS FROM CHINA LOOKING AT ENERGY CALLS BUSINESS RATES WHAT MORE CAN HE DO
I MEAN THE OUTPUT OF THIRTEEN PERCENT TARIFF ON THE CHINESE STEEL IMPORTS INTO THIS COUNTRY BY THE CHINESE HAVE JUST PUT A FORTY SIX PERCENT TARIFF ON ANY IMPORTS GOING INTO THEIR COUNTRY SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE JUST PLAYING AT IT
GETTING BACK TO THE GREY BALL DEAL THEN WHAT ASSURANCES HAVE THEY GIVEN THEIR UNIONS AND WORKERS THAT THEY WON'T COME IN HERE AND RESTRUCTURE AGAIN AND WE CAN SEE MORE JOB LOSSES WERE PART OF THE DEAL OF GOING FORWARD IS IT IT IS IF THIS BALLET GOES THROUGH WITH THE YES AND THERE WILL BE NO MORE RESTRUCTURING THERE WILL BE A MASSIVE JOB LOSSES WITHIN THIS INDUSTRY WE'VE HAD ASSURANCES OF
IT'S JUST AS BRITISH STEEL WE IT'S OPEN IT'S OPEN UP AND WENT GET OUR REDS DOWN OR PRETTY SURE WHAT WE CAN DO
O.K. PAUL THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THAT WILL GROW ABLE HOPES HE CAN TURN THIS BUSINESS AROUND IN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR MORE WAIT FOR NEWS LATER THIS MORNING AND WHETHER THAT DEAL IS SIGNED
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE FROM HEDGEROWS TO HOUSE SPARROWS BUTTERFLIES TO BUMBLE IS THE STORY OF BRITISH WILDLIFE SOMETIMES SEEMS TO BE ONE OF REMORSELESS DECLINE BUT NOT EVERYWHERE AND NOT ALL THE TIME THERE ARE SOME BRIGHT SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT PEEKING THROUGH HERE AND THERE TO LIGHTEN THE GLOOM EXAMPLES OF SPECIES OR PLACES THAT ARE BUCKING THE TREND
HOW DO WE TURN THOSE GREEN SHOOTS INTO A FULL BLOWN RECOVERY THAT IS THE FOCUS OF A NEW BOOK IT'S CALLED WILD KINGDOM BY THE NATURAL HISTORY FILMMAKER STEPHEN MOSS HE WENT FOR A WALK WITH OUR SCIENCE EDITOR TOM FIELD AND ON THE SOMERSET LEVELS
WE'RE STANDING IN THE SHADOW OF GLASTONBURY TOR AND THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED THE AVALON MARSHES TO TRIBUTES KING ARTHUR WHO'S ALLEGEDLY BURIED UP THERE KING ALFRED BURNT THE CAKES DOWN THE ROAD BUT NOW
THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST
NEW PLACE FOR WILDLIFE IN THE WHOLE OF
THEY'RE NOT KILLERS IN HAND STEPHEN MOSS LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST OPEN EXPANSE OF REED BED MARTIAN OPEN WATER IN THE HEART OF THE SOMERSET LEVELS IS A MALE MARSH HARRIER JUST COMING ACROSS HERE THAT THIS IS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL BIRD FLOATS
LOW OVER THE REED IT'S A VIEW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY TOO FAMILIAR TO KING ALFRED WHO HID HERE OFF TO DEFEAT BY THE DANES IN HATE SEVENTY EIGHT BURNT THOSE CAKES BUT HAD ALL BUT DISAPPEARED DRAINED FOR FARMLAND AND DUG OUT ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE FOR ITS RICH PEATY SOILS BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY
BUT NOT ANY MORE IT'S QUITE DELIBERATE IT'S
A VERY MODERN LANDSCAPE IT'S POST INDUSTRIAL AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU DIG PETE YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM THAT THE HOLES YOU LEAVE BEHIND FILL WITH WATER AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN WOULD YOU DO WITH IT YOU CAN'T PUT THE SOIL BACK YOU CAN'T FARM IT AND SO REALLY THE ONLY CHOICE APART FROM ONE TERRIBLE
PROPOSAL TO FIT IT WITH BRISTOL'S LANDFILL RUBBISH WAS TO TURN IT INTO THIS INCREDIBLE NATURE RESERVE BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS THIRTY YEARS AGO I DON'T THINK THEY COULD EVER HAVE QUITE IMAGINE IT WOULD TURN OUT AS GOOD AS IT HAS
THAT IF YOU HEARD THAT WAS A CHURCH'S WARBLER IT'S A VERY VERY SKULKING LITTLE BIRD YOU SEE THEM BUT THEY HAVE THE LOUDEST SONG OF ANY SMALL BIRD
ON A WARM SUNDAY AFTERNOON TOWARDS THE END OF APRIL THE LONG NARROW PATH THAT BISECTS THIS VAST WETLAND
IS HEAVING WITH LIFE BUT NOW THERE'S A KINGDOM IS NOT JUST ABOUT A STUNNINGLY SUCCESSFUL LANDSCAPE SCALE WETLAND RESTORATION PROJECT IT'S ALSO ABOUT ADOPTING AN APPROACH TO NATURE STEPHEN MOSS BELIEVES WE NEED TO APPLY TO COAX CROSS HELEN DALE THAT KEPT
Q. IN THE SALARY WAS
WHITE THROATS LAUNCH THEMSELVES INTO THE AIR FROM THE TOPS OF BRAMBLES THERE SCRATCHY SOME MATCHING THEIR CHOICE OF HER OWN
IN SOME WAYS IT'S QUITE EASY TO SAVE THE BIT OF THE OSPREY BECAUSE THESE ARE CREATURES THAT NEED SPECIALIST HABITATS IF YOU PROVIDE THAT HABITAT THEY WILL THRIVE IT'S BEEN A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM FOR GENERALIST CREATURES THINGS LIKE THE HOUSE SPARROW THE HEDGEHOG THE BROWN HAIR
THESE CREATURES NEED OPEN COUNTRYSIDE THEY NEED FOOD THEY NEED A PLACE TO LIVE AND WE HAVE TRANSFORMED THE COUNTRYSIDE INTO A FOOD FACTORY AND OF COURSE WE NEED TO PRODUCE FOOD BUT WE NEED TO MAKE ROOM FOR WILDLIFE AS WELL AND THAT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING OVER VAST SWATHES OF BRITAIN
IT'S NOT JUST FARMERS THOUGH IS IT I MEAN THE SUPERMARKETS OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE LIKES TO HAVE A GO AT THE SUPERMARKETS BUT IT'S ALSO US AS WELL ISN'T IT WE HAVE DEMANDED CHEAP FOOD
IT'S ENTIRELY DOWN TO US IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S DAY PEOPLE SPENT A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME ON FOOD THEY NOW SPEND LESS THAN TEN PER CENT WE CAN'T DO THIS AND CAN'T SUSTAIN IT FOR ANY LONGER BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WE NEED TO WONDER WHAT THE COUNTRYSIDE IS FOR
AND IN MY VIEW THE COUNTRYSIDE IS NOT THE COUNTRYSIDE IF THERE'S NO WILDLIFE IN IT IT'S JUST AN AGRICULTURAL DESERT AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT GOOD
HUGE WHITE BIRDS HAVE JUST EMERGED FROM THE REED BEDS THESE ARE GREAT WHITE EGRETS SO THERE ARE GOOD NEWS STORIES LIKE THIS
TOM FIELDEN REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE ROLE PLAYED BY OFFSHORE TAX HAVENS BEEN ON THE SPOT LIKE QUITE A LOT OVER THE LAST WEEK THEY INCLUDE THE ISLE OF MAN AND JOAN I AM HE'S BACK WITH US TALK ABOUT IT YES INDEED MANY CROWN DEPENDENCIES AND OVERSEAS TERRITORIES DEPEND CRUCIALLY ON INTERNATIONAL BANKING AND FINANCE FOR THEIR SURVIVAL BUT THAT'S UNDER THREAT LIKE NEVER BEFORE SINCE THE LEAKS FROM MOSS LIKE VON SECKER
MANY IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ARE CALLING FOR THE VEIL OF SECRECY WHICH THESE ISLANDS OFFER TO BE REMOVED AND FOR THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF ALL OFFSHORE COMPANIES TO BE VISIBLE THE ISLE OF MAN HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL CO OPERATE FAR CLOSER WITH THE U.K. GOVERNMENT ON TRANSPARENCY IN WITH ME NOW IS ALAN BELL THE CHIEF MINISTER OF THE ISLE OF MAN IS JOINING US FROM PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS IN DOUGLAS GOOD MORNING CHIEF MINISTER
WHAT NEW THINGS ARE YOU INTRODUCING
FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO TO DEVELOP A NEW APPROACH TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF THE BARRIERS
WE HAVE COMMITTED
NOW TO A CENTRAL ELECTRONIC REGISTER
WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT OH KAY AND HOW QUICKLY IF FOR EXAMPLE LATER MARCIE HERE WANTED TO FIND OUT THE BENEFICIAL OLDER OF A COMPANY REGISTERED IN THE ISLE OF MAN HOW QUICKLY COULD THEY DO THAT
O.K. THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER OFFSHORE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CENTRES WHAT ABOUT INDIVIDUALS IN BRITAIN COULD THEY DO A SEARCH OF COMPANIES AND THEIR BENEFICIAL OWNERS
BUT IS THE ERA OF SECRETIVE TAX HAVENS COMING TO AN END DO YOU THINK CHIEF MINISTER BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU
THE OTHER MAN HAS NEVER HAD BANKING SECRECY AND WE
EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BUT THE SECRET PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT UNDERSTAND I THINK THOSE DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND THE ISLE OF MAN IS VERY MUCH PART OF THE MOVEMENT I THINK TO TRY AND
AND IT'S GOT A LOT MORE PRESSURE ON OVERSEAS TERRITORIES SUCH AS THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS ISN'T IT
PEOPLE TEND TO FORGET YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A VERY EASY THE STATEMENT MADE ABOUT THE SMALL JURISDICTIONS BEING TAX HAVENS BUT THE PLANTS SHOW SORRY THE FLAT'S JUST JUSTICE NETWORK LAST YEAR ATTITUDE IT'S FINANCIAL SECRECY
MANY SENTIMENT BUT THE U.K. IS PALM OR PROBLEM

WHAT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY IS THAT MANY YEARS AFTER THE EVENT YOU WROTE ABOUT IT AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS A HUGE AUDIENCE FOR THE STORY PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR THIS
EH THANKS FOR IMITATION FIRST OF ALL YOU IT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SO I WROTE THIS BOOK BEFORE BUT I'VE DECIDED TO PUBLISH PUBLISH IT AFTER THE LAST WAR WE HEARD IN GEORGIA RUSSIA GEORGIA OR WAR I MEAN AND WE'RE IN THE STARTING THEY BEGIN I AM I OWE STRIKES ON THEM TO BE LISA ON THE CAPITAL OF GEORGIA I DECIDED TO PUBLISH THIS BOOK BOOK BECAUSE
BEFORE I DIDNA DORY BECAUSE THEY'D STORIES VERY CRITICAL SO VERY DRAMATIC SO I DIDN'T WANT TO REMIND TO THERE OR WORRIED THERE'S A GING ABOUT THEY ALL HAPPENING IN SO SOLID GEORGIAN IT WASN'T NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN THE GROUP OFF FOR YOUNG GUYS THEY DECIDE THEY HADJIT TRIED TO HIJACK A PLANE FROM THERE SO IT YOU KNOW THIS BOOK IS PUBLISHED
ELEVEN COUNTRIES BUT IN EX SOVIET COUNTRIES THE PUBLISHERS DID NOT HENRY AND ALSO THEY DON'T HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE SOVIET UNION OR HOT HOW HAHAHA WHICH WAS HOW IT HAPPENED
THEY HAD THE COUNTRY WAS SO CALL THAT PEOPLE DECIDED TO TO TO ESCAPE FROM FROM WHAT FROM THE COUNTRY HATE TAKING A PLANE SO THIS WAS A JET THAT WENT VERY WRONG I MEAN THERE WERE CREW WHO DIED THERE WHAT SOME OF THE HIJACKERS THEMSELVES AND HAVE A COUPLE OF THE PASSENGERS AND GET YOU A VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THIS

YOU IMAGINE YOU WHAT DO YOU WANT TO ESCAPE FROM THE COUNTRY AND YOU THINK THAT ONLY ONE SOLUTION IS TO HIJACK A PLANE SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT WHEN THEY WERE IN THE BEGINNING OF
FOR FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN THEY DECIDED TO PUBLISHED HIS BOOK IN NETHERLANDS FOR EXAMPLE THEY ASKED ME TO WRITE A SPECIAL CHAPTER TO EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE SAW WHICH UNION BECAUSE THEY DID THAT IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR EXAMPLE BUT NOT FOUR IN UKRAINE FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS VERY CLEAN FOR MY PUBLISHER WOULD THAT WOULD BE IT WHAT DOES IT MEAN RIGHT SO LONG AFTER THE EVENT WHY DOES IT STILL HAVE RESONANCE

THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES TO NINE SEVENTEEN SCHOOLS IN EDINBURGH CLOSE TODAY WILL BE CLOSED INDEFINITELY BECAUSE AS WE WERE HEARING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME THEY CANNOT BE GUARANTEED TO BE SAFE SEVEN THOUSAND PUPILS HAVE NOWHERE TO GO THE SCHOOLS WERE ALL BUILT AS PART OF THE SCENE PRIVATE FINANCE PROGRAMME BACK IN TWO THOUSAND WON BUILT OR REFURBISHED ON THAT DATE OR RAISING ONCE AGAIN THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE P.F.I. WHICH BEGAN AS A WAY OF FINANCING PUBLIC WORKS UNDER JOHN MAJOR BUT REALLY TOOK OFF UNDER
NEW LABOUR TONY TRAVIS IS HERE VISITING PROFESSOR AT THE L.S.E. IS GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT TO STELLA CREASES ON THE LINE LABOUR M.P. WHO SAT ON THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE WHEN THEY REVIEW THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF P.F.I. MORNING TO YOU BOTH I KNOW COULD YOU START OFF WITH THAT TONY TRAVIS DOES LOOK LIKE QUITE A MESS WHERE DOES THIS WILL TEST THE LOGIC OF P.F.I. I AM IN THE WHOLE IDEA OF IT WAS THAT THE RISK COULD BE TRANSFERRED FROM PUBLIC SECTOR TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND
THIS WILL REALLY PUT TO THIS TEST FIAT PUT THE TEST THE IDEA THAT THE FAILURES HERE REVEALED ARE PUT RIGHT BY THE COMPANY ALL THEIR SUCCESSES THAT DID THE WORKS IT'S A TEST OF THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORK THAT'S THE INTERESTING POINT ISN'T IT STARE CRITIC AS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU FOUND ANOTHER CRITICS OF P.F.I. ARE FOUND IS THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THAT THE STANDARD OF THE CONTRACTS THAT WAS SIGNED BETWEEN THE PUBLIC BODIES AND THE PRIVATE ONES AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A TEST ISN'T IT
YES ABSOLUTELY I MEAN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'M VERY SCEPTICAL ABOUT P.F.I. AND GEORGE OSBORNE SUCCESSOR P. F. TWO IS DEALING WITH THE BASIC ISSUE WHICH IS THE CONTRACT OF THE DEAL THAT YOU GET I MEAN I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU BUY SOMETHING IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW WHAT AM I BUYING BUT ALSO CAN I AFFORD IT AND WILL IT WORK SO THE CRITICAL ISSUE HERE AND BEAR IN MIND THAT SCOTLAND'S GOT FORTY PERCENT OF THE U.K. SCHOOL P.F.I. PROJECTS IN TOTAL
IS WHAT'S IN THE CONTRACT WHAT REPARATIONS CAN BE MADE AS A RESULT OF IT AND ONE OF THE WORRIES WITH P. F. TWO IS IT JUST DOESN'T DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE AT ALL BUT TONY TRAVERSE SOME OF THE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN DECENT YES I MEAN THE IDEA BEHIND P.F.I. WHICH WAS AS YOU SAY VERY HEAVILY USED IN THE LABOUR NEW LABOUR YEARS BY GORDON BROWN IS THAT IT ALLOWED PROJECTS TO GO AHEAD WHICH OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE AHEAD THEN THEY JUST NOT HAVE HAPPENED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED FOR YEARS SO
AND ANYWAY NOT ALL OF THEM FAIL SOME OF THEM HAVE DELIVERED ON TIME ON TIME AND ON BUDGET BUT THE FAILURES UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND WHERE THEY OCCUR THEY BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WHOLE MODEL BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANY GOVERNMENT TO GET AWAY COMPLETELY FROM THE LOGIC OF
P.F.I. WHICH EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERS THE COSTS OF BUILDING THE PROJECT AND THEN MAINTAINING IT AND PAYING BACK THE COSTS OVER TIME TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR PARTLY BECAUSE IT BRINGS CAPITAL PROJECTS TO TODAY WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO BE PUT OFF TO THE FUTURE GOVERNMENTS LIKE THAT YEAH I KNOW AND SO DO THE PEOPLE WHO USE THE SERVICES STELLA CREASY
WHAT I'VE CALLED THIS THE LEGAL LOAN SHARKING OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR BECAUSE THE DEVIL REALLY IS IN THE DETAIL AND THE NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS THAT HE SIGN AND BOTH P.F.I. AND P. F. TWO P. F. TWO WORRIES ME BECAUSE IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN P.F.I. IF YOU TALK TO THE
INDUSTRY EXPERTS ARE VERY WORRIED BY THE NATURE OF THE DEALS THAT GEORGE OSBORNE IS TRYING TO MAKE BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT THOUGH AT THE RATE OF RETURN WHICH IS LIKE THE EQUIVALENT OF THE INTEREST RATE THE NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS AND WHAT YOU'RE LOCKED INTO AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER BASE IS VERY RESTRICTED IF A PRIVATE COMPANY GOES BUST IT GOES BUST BUT A VERY PUBLIC INSTITUTION LIKE A SCHOOL ON ON MY LOCAL HOSPITAL WHIPPS CROSS WHICH IS REALLY CRIPPLED BY A P.F. DEAL GOES BUST THAT PUBLIC SECTOR WILL STEP IN
TONY'S RIGHT THERE ARE SOME DEALS OUT OF WORK A LOT THAT HAVEN'T AND I'M WORRIED WE'RE NOT LEARNING THEIR LESSONS ABOUT HOW WE GET IT RIGHT YOU ALSO ACCEPT THOUGH THAT EDINBURGH IS GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING TEST CASE BECAUSE IF EDINBURGH GOES RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT THESE WALLS APPARENTLY SOME OF THE WALLS ARE POTENTIALLY UNSAVOURY THE WALLS ARE QUICKLY FIXED AND THE KIDS GO BACK IN AND THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES DON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY MORE THAN IT IS A DEMONSTRATION THAT THINGS CAN GO RIGHT
ABSOLUTELY BUT IT'S LIKE IF YOU GET BUILDERS IN AND THEY DO A BAD JOB YOUR QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS TO GET REDRESS ON THAT MY WORRY IS THAT P. F. TWO WILL ACTUALLY LOCK US IN AS THE PUBLIC SECTOR INTO TAKING ON EVEN MORE OF THAT RISK AT A HIGHER PRICE SO WHEN GEORGE OSBORNE SAYING OH DON'T WORRY I'LL SORT OUT THE P.F.I. MODEL I THINK ALL OF US SHOULD BE VERY SCEPTICAL
WE NEED A WIDER RANGE OF MODELS FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR THAT WILL ALLOW DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS WHETHER IT'S BUILDING ROADS AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO BRING IN MORE HOSPITALS OR SCHOOLS TO BETTER REFLECT THAT AND GET A BETTER DEAL TO TONY'S RIGHT THERE SOME DEALS OF WORK BUT A LOT OF THEM HAVEN'T AND IF WE DON'T GET THOSE DEALS RIGHT WE DON'T OFFER THAT FLEXIBILITY WHETHER IT'S BONDS OR WHETHER IT'S SOME OF THE OTHER MODELS IN TERMS OF TAX RETURNS AND ACTUALLY WE COULD BE LESS WE COULD BE SADDLING FUTURE GENERATIONS OF A LOT MORE DEBT AS A RESULT TONY TRAVIS
I THINK THE THE THE THE REAL CHALLENGE WITH PARTICULARLY THE P.F.I. TYPE DEALS THAT WERE DONE IN THE PAST WHICH ARE NOW ON THE BOOKS AND WILL BE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME IN MANY CASES IS THAT PARTICULAR FOR THE N.H.S. ONES WHAT ABOUT SCHOOLS THIS MORNING BUT FOR THE HEALTH SERVICE ONES
THEY LEFT A LONG NUMBER OF YEARS WHERE THE SERVICE CHARGES WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE WHEN IT WAS HER SEEMED AT THE TIME THEN IT SPENDING WOULD RISE INTO THE IMAGINABLE FUTURE AND OF COURSE IT'S BEEN FLAT FOR YEARS NOW SO I MEAN THERE ARE STILL INCREASES CORRECT THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH MAKING THESE PROJECTS REALLY WORK FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN THE LONG TERM TONY TRAVIS AND STELLA CREASY AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH OUR EDITORS TODAY WERE JONATHAN HARVEY AND ADAM COME A SKI FROM US ALL HAVE A VERY GOOD MORNING
