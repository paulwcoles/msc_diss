TO HAVE AN AREA OF CLOUD TO START THE DAY ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST THAT'S GOING TO MOVE AWAY PRETTY QUICKLY AND THEN SOME SUNNY SPELLS FOR ALL OF THIS AREA THERE'LL BE A FEW SHOWERS RUNNING DOWN THE IRISH SEA COASTS AND THEY WERE FACTOR WESTERN WALES AND CORNWALL TODAY COULD EVEN GET A FEW FLAKES OF SNOW FROM SOME OF THEM BUT NOT REALLY SETTLING IN THE SUNSHINE WE'RE LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES CLIMBING TO ROUND SEVEN CELSIUS SO IT'S QUITE A CHILLY DAY
THE SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS EASTERN ENGLAND AND ALL OF NORTHERN ENGLAND AN AREA OF CLOUD TO START THE DAY ACROSS EAST ANGLIA AND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND WILL MOVE AWAY QUICKLY TO ALLOW PLENTY OF MORNING SUNSHINE A COLD AND FROSTY START TO THE MORNING FOR ALL OF US AS WE HEAD TOWARDS THE EARLY AFTERNOON WE ARE GOING TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD DEVELOPING BUT STILL STAYING BRIGHT AND DRY WITH SUNNY SPELLS AND TEMPERATURES RANGING BETWEEN FOUR AND SEVEN DEGREES CELSIUS
IN NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S A CLOUDY START TO THE MORNING THAT CLOUD IS EXPECTED TO THIN AND BREAK UP AS WE HEAD TOWARDS THE MIDDLE PART OF THE DAY ME AFTERNOON STAYING FINE THERE WILL BE SOME BRIGHT SPELLS BUT WITH AN AREA OF HIGH CLOUD OVER THE TOP OF NORTHERN IRELAND ANY SUNSHINE GETTING THROUGH WILL BE ON THE HAZY SIDE TEMPERATURES TODAY REACHING A HEIGHT OF SIX DEGREES CELSIUS
IN SCOTLAND WHERE WE'VE GOT SNOW SHOWERS AGAIN ACROSS NORTHERN SCOTLAND AND THE SNOW IN THE COLDER IT'S GETTING RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO SEA LEVEL AS PRESSURE BUILDS SO AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE DAY THOSE SHOWERS WILL BECOME LESS WIDESPREAD UNLESS HEAVY MAINLY AFFECTING THE WESTERN ISLES AND ALSO SHETLAND WHERE THERE WILL STILL BE A FEW HEAVY SHOWERS INTO THE AFTERNOON BUT THE SCOTTISH MAINLAND STAYING LARGELY DRY THROUGH THE AFTERNOON PLENTY OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE CENTRAL BELT AND HIGHS BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE DEGREES THAT'S THE ONE
CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND AS WE WERE HEARING IN THE NEWS THE NEWSPAPER IS ONE NEWSPAPER DOMINATED WITH WADI TEAR CLAIMS HE'S A WORLD EXCLUSIVE AND IT'S A STORY ABOUT TONY BLACKBURN IN THE NEWSPAPER IS THE DAILY MIRROR
AND THEIR HEADLINE IS B.B.C. AXED SEX PROBED D.J. TONY BLACKBURN IN FACT HE'S NOT ACCUSED OF ANY WRONGDOING THAT HE IS HIMSELF MADE A STATEMENT SAYING THIS WEEK TWO DAYS BEFORE THE PUBLICATION OF THE DAME JANET SMITH REPORT
THE B. B. C. INFORMED ME THAT ALL RELATIONSHIPS I HAD WITH THEM WERE BEING TERMINATED WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT UNTIL THE DECISION WAS TAKEN PERSONALLY BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL QUITE NATURALLY I AM DEVASTATED AND HE SAYS THE REASON IS THAT HE'S BEEN GIVEN FOR THE B.B.C. TAKING THIS DECISION OF AT HIS EVIDENCE TO DAME JANET SMITH SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A COVER UP A COVER UP OF THE EXTENT OF
AN INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS THAT HAD BEEN MADE BY A GIRL HE SUBSEQUENTLY TOOK HER OWN LIFE BUT THIS WAS A COVER UP THAT HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF AT ALL
THEN JANET'S REPORT TONY BLACKBURN SAYS MAKE NO SUGGESTION I WAS GUILTY MANY MISCONDUCT WHAT SO EVER NOR DID AN INQUEST NOR ORDERED A POLICE INQUIRY B. B. C. MAY CLEAR THEY'RE NOT TERMINATING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BECAUSE OF ANY MISS CONDUCT BUT TEN ABOUT THAT SAYS THEY'RE DESTROYING MY CAREER AND REPUTATION BECAUSE MY VERSION OF EVENTS DOESN'T
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH A BELIEVES THAT MICHAEL GOES MAY BE FACING THE SACK OVER THE FACT THAT HE'S CHALLENGE THE LEGAL BASIS FOR DAVID CAMERON'S BRUSSELS DEAL IT SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER'S BEING URGED BY MINISTERIAL ALLIES TO REMOVE MISTER GO FROM HIS POST IN THE WEEKS FOLLOWING THE IN OUT REFERENDUM ON JUNE THE TWENTY
AFTER HE QUESTIONED THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE DEAL WITH BRUSSELS OR THE PRIME MINISTER THAT PAPER SAYS THERE'S BEEN ANGERED BY MISTER GO BECAUSE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY ASSURED HIM HE WOULD KEEP A LOW PROFILE AFTER DECLARING HE WOULD CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE E.U. ONE MINISTERIAL ALLY OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S HAS TOLD THE PAPER IT IS UNTENABLE TO HAVE HER JUSTICE SECRETARY AFTER THE REFERENDUM WHO OPPOSED THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S DEAL IT JUST WON'T
THE TIMES CARRIES ON ITS REPORTING GROUNDBREAKING REPORTING AT THEIR RATHER AND CHILD SEX ABUSE SCANDAL WITH THE ALLEGATION THAT CORRUPT POLICE AND AN INFLUENTIAL POLITICIAN FUELLED A CULTURE OF IMPUNITY WHO ALLOWED THREE BROTHERS TO OWN THE TOWN RATHER HIM AS IT PUTS IN ABUSE CHILDREN UNTIL THEIR CRIMES WERE EXPOSED BY THE SUN THE TIMES SAYS ONE OFFICER I HAD SEX WITH
UNDERAGE GIRLS PAST DRUGS TO THE SEX GROOMING GANG AND TIPPED THEM OFF WHEN COLLEAGUES WERE SEARCHING FOR MISSING CHILDREN THE TIME IS NOW TEN PAST SIX NOW LET US TURN STRAIGHTAWAY TO MATTERS EUROPEAN COS YOU WERE HARING IN NEWS THAT HE'S GOING TO BE A NUN YET ANOTHER MEETING ABOUT THE MIGRANT CRISIS TODAY IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN BRUSSELS IT'S A MEETING OF HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER IS CHRIS MORRIS CORRESPONDENT HE'S ON THE LINE IN
CHRIS YOU USE THE PHRASE IN YOUR PIECE IN THE NEWS THAT THERE'S THAT THE AIR IS THICK WITH RECRIMINATIONS AND IS THERE ANY REALISTIC PROSPECT THAN THEY GET ANYWHERE TODAY
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET SOMEWHERE QUICKLY IF THIS ISN'T GOING TO GET A WHOLE LOT WORSE AND I THINK THAT'S THE ONE THING DRIVING THEM ON WERE IN WHAT LATE FEBRUARY AND I THINK THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT IN ABOUT A MONTH'S TIME AS THE WEATHER IMPROVES IN THE AEGEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IT IS LIKELY THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CROSSING THE SEA
COULD INCREASE AGAIN SIGNIFICANTLY SO IF SOMETHING ISN'T DONE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND WE HAVE TWO FULL E.U. SUMMITS COMING UP IN QUICK SUCCESSION DEALING JUST WITH MIGRATION BECAUSE OF THAT THEN I THINK THINGS REALLY WILL TAKE A TURN FOR THE WORSE AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH FRUSTRATION IN THE AIR
WE HAVE A PROBLEM THAT IMAGE THIS WEEK OF GREECE ISSUING A FORMAL DIPLOMATIC PROTEST AGAINST AUSTRIA ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S PRETTY UNUSUAL THE AUSTRIANS ARE CUES IN GERMANY OF SENDING MIXED MESSAGES TO EVERY MIGRANT ARRIVING IN EUROPE TO EITHER STOP OR GO DEPENDING ON WHICH GERMAN OFFICIALLY SPEAKING
AND COUNTRIES ARE STARTING TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION THE IDEA HAS BEEN IT HAS TO BE A COMMON RESPONSE ACROSS THE E.U. AFOOT TO PRESERVE THE BORDER FREE SHOWING AN AREA BUT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS STARTED BY AUSTRIA BUT THEN WITH A CHAIN REACTION DOWN THROUGH THE BALKANS COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN SIMPLY INTRODUCING THEIR OWN BORDER RESTRICTIONS AND THAT IS INEVITABLY CREATING A BOTTLENECK IN THE FIRST COUNTRY THEY ARRIVE THE COUNTRY PROBABLY LEAST EQUIPPED TO COPE WITH IT ALL AND THAT'S KRIS KRIS MORRIS IN RUSSELL'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TURN TO SIMON WHO'S HERE WITH THIS MORNING'S BUSINESS NEWS SIMON YEAH THE TELECOMS REGULATOR OFCOM IS GOING TO SET OUT IT'S HER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF B.T. OPENREACH LATER THIS MORNING I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL SEEN THE VAN'S THIS IS THE BIT OF B.T.
THAT OWNS THE CABLES HAVE BEEN TELEPHONE BROADBAND CONNECTION TO MOST HOMES AND BUSINESSES IN THE U.K. IT'S A SO CALLED LAST MILE OF VIBRANT COPPER WIRES THAT RUN FROM THE LOCAL TELEPHONE EXCHANGE NOW ALL THE OTHER SERVICE PROVIDER SKY TALKTALK VODAFONE AND THE LIKE HAVE TO PAY B.T. FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF USING THESE CABLES AND THEY DON'T LIKE IT THEY SAY IT'S ANTI COMPETITIVE AND THEY WANT OPENREACH SPLIT OFF
FROM THE GROUP THEY'VE ALSO ACCUSED B.T. HAVE UNDER INVESTING IN THE NETWORK WHICH LET LEADS TO POOR SERVICE FOR EVERYONE TO OFCOM'S BEEN CONSIDERING WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT ALEX DE GROOT IS A MEDIA ANALYST FROM PEEL AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THEM AT SEVEN O'CLOCK WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING OFCOM TO SAY
WE ARE NOT EXPECTING A PROPER SPIN OFF WHICH I THINK WOULD BE THE MOST HEADLINE GRABBING MOVE I THINK MORE GOVERNANCE IS LIKELY I THINK PRICE CONTROLS ARE LIKELY AND I THINK SOME MODEST SEPARATION OF OPENREACH FROM B.T. PLEASE POSSIBLE
BUT NOT AN ENTICEMENT O. K. THAT'S FROM PEOPLE YOU KNOW A QUAICH THIS DO IT'S A BIT LIKE BRITISH AIRWAYS OWNING HEATHROW IT THEN IT SHORT OF A SPIN OFF BUT THE OTHER COMPETITORS WILL NEVER BE HAPPY THAT'S RIGHT IT'S THE INCUMBENTS OF AS A NATURAL MONOPOLY HERE I THINK WE CAN ARGUE WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR ANYBODY ELSE TO DUPLICATE WHAT THEY'VE CREATED
TO THAT EXTENT I THINK IT'LL BE DIFFICULT TO HOLY HOWEVER OFFER OPENREACH FROM B.T. AND A B.T. HAS SAID THAT THEY'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE WITH THE SCALE TO RUN SOMETHING OF THIS SIZE IN THE SEVENTY SIX MILLION MILES OF WIRE AND COPPER AND ALSO THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF THE SORT OF DIGITAL ROLLER INTO RURAL AREAS IF THEY WERE TO SPLIT IT UP THAT WOULD
PUT THAT PROCESS BACK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE SHORT TERM IT COULD BE IMMENSELY DISRUPTIVE TO ANY OF THOSE PLANS AND I THINK TODAY'S INITIATIVE IS ALL ABOUT POLICY MAKING MEETING THE CORPORATE WORLD BUT I THINK PROBABLY POLICY MAKING WITHOUT SOME OF THE COMPETITORS SAY THAT
B.T.'S OFFER JUST THE OTHER DAY TO SPEND AN EXTRA BILLION POUNDS ON ITS NETWORK IS A SIGN THAT B.T. ACTUALLY HAS LOST THE ARGUMENT AND HE'S ACTUALLY JUST PREVARICATING HERE AND TRYING THIS IS A SOP TO THE GOVERNMENT IT THAT COULD BE ONE INTERPRETATION FOR SURE CERTAINLY THE TIMING OF THAT MOVE IS VERY INTERESTING COMING AHEAD OF TODAY'S MOVED I THINK ON ONE SIDE A DEBATE YOU HAVE B.T. ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE THE LIKES OF VODAFONE SKY TALK TALK
ALL THE WOULD BE ASPIRIN BROUGHT THEIR MARKET SHARE THEM BRINGING JESSICA GROUND HIS U.K. EQUITIES FUND MANAGER AT SCHROEDER'S AM IS A B.T. OWNER I'M SURE ARE YOU ARE YOU YES YOU ARE I MEAN IS THIS A NEGATIVE CLOUD HANGING OVER THE CAR COMPANY IF ALEX IS RIGHT AND THEY BASICALLY SAY GIVE A PULL YOUR SOCKS UP A BIT
PROOF HE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE A BIT BUT YOU KNOW AS YOU WERE AT THAT IS THAT IT
IN A POSITIVE FOR THE CHESS I THINK WE'VE BEEN RUNNING A NUMBER OF SCENARIOS AND THE EXPECTATIONS NOW RESTED THAT IT SORT OF AROUND GOVERNMENTS AND IT WON'T BE A FULL SPLIT OFF BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WITH THAT WE'VE CAN CONSIDERED AS AS A RISK AND YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO US THEY'D BE THE OPENREACH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT A LOT OF THINGS AND THERE'D BE TEARS IS ABOUT THEIR CONSOLIDATION OF IAN AND MOVING INTO NOBILE AND THEY'RE CONTENT AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHY SOME OF THESE PEOPLE LIKE VODAFONE AND FOR AND SKY ARE REALLY PUDDING THERE'S THE SCREWS ON B.T. BECAUSE IT'S A BIG CASH COW ISN'T IT ALEX FOR THIRTY PERCENT OF EARNINGS LAST YEAR FORTY PERCENT OF PROFITS WITHOUT THE CASH COMING FROM THIS MAYBE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND BIG SPEND BIG ON SPORT IT'S HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT AND IT WOULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THEIR FINANCIAL MODEL WOMEN NOT TO OWN A HUNDRED PER CENT OF IT OH K. WILL GET THOSE RESULTS AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
JESSICA JUST I WANTED TO HAVE A LISTEN TO A LITTLE QUICK LISTEN TO THIS TIP CLIP OF TIM COOKE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF APPLE IN THIS STAND OFF OVER WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD UNLOCK THE PHONE IN THE OUT THE F.B.I. WHICH AS THE F.B.I. WANT TO GRAB FRANZ TRACKED DOWN THE SAN BERNARDINO KILLERS
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE INFORMATION ON THIS PHONE IN THE NEXT OFFICE OVER WE HAD NO OTHER INFORMATION ON THE SPA NINE THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW TO GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS TO WRITE A PIECE OF SOFTWARE THAT IS THE SOFTWARE EQUIVALENT OF CANCER THAT IS WHAT IS ICH STATE HERE
WE THINK AT THIS POINT GIVEN IT IS OUT IN THE PUBLIC ISN'T IT WE NEED TO STAND HALL INSTANT HALL ON PRINCIPLE THIS SEEMS TO BE A STRAIGHT SHOOTOUT BETWEEN APPLE VERSES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OVER OVER U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IS THIS GOOD OR BAD FOR APPLE
IT'S SO COMPLEX THIS AREA WHEN GOOGLE STARTED THEY SAID WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO NO EVIL AND I THINK WE'VE LEARNT THROUGH THE EVOLUTION THE INTERNET THAT THERE ARE SHADES OF GREY HERE BUT I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR APPLE BECAUSE APPLE ISN'T JUST ABOUT PRODUCTS IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND THE WAY THAT IT
IT HAS ACCESS TO SO MUCH DATA EFFORT FOR ALL OF OUR LIVES NOT JUST FROM MUSIC BUT I CLOUD PHOTOS LOCATIONS AND HOW WE STORE THINGS AND A BIG PART OF THEIR TARGET BASS IS YOU KNOW IT'S GLOBAL AND IT'S MILLENNIAL HIS HOOF WILL FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS THINK APPLE PROBABLY FEELS THAT
THIS IS NOT JUST A ONE OFF THIS IS ABOUT SHOWING YOU CAN PUT YOUR LIFE ONTO THIS ECOSYSTEM AND IT'S SAFE IT'S GOT INCHING DONALD TRUMP TWEETED OR SENT A MESSAGE SAYING BOYCOTT APPLE PRODUCTS SENT FROM MY I'D PHONE UNDERNEATH WHICH WAS QUITE OF MUSIC'S THE G. TWENTY A MEETING IN SHANGHAI AND AHEAD OF THAT MEETING THE I.M.F. IN SOME MONEY FOR MONETARY FUND IS CALLING FOR COORDINATOR GLOBAL ACTION TO BOOST DEMAND A SORT OF TACIT ADMISSION THE GLOBAL ECONOMY LOOKS PRETTY SHAKY
YES AN INDICATION THAT THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING TO DOWNGRADE GLOBAL GROSS FORECAST LATER IN THE YEAR I THINK THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF DEBATE NOW THE I.M.F. IS GOING OUT EARLY AND SORT OF SAYING WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE SERI AUSTERITY IS A WAY FORWARD WE WANTS THIS CABOOSE WE WANT YOU TO DO MORE
WE WANT YOU TO ENCOURAGE SPENDING BUT THEN THE U.S. ALSO COMING OUT SAYING THAT'S GREAT FOR CHINA WE WANT YOU TO DO MORE AND SO I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE GOING TO REACH A CONSENSUS WHERE IS I MEAN IT FEELS EDGY OUT THERE WE HAD A WE HAD A WOBBLE IN JANUARY IT'S RECOVERED A BEER WE SAW IT GET LOOKING A BIT WOBBLY AGAIN YESTERDAY IT JUST FEELS LIKE A NO ONE'S QUITE SURE WHICH DIRECTION TO GO AT THE MOMENT UNDOUBTEDLY I THINK YOU KNOW
THE OUTLOOK FOR IT FOR THE U.S. IS DEFINITELY SOFTER THERE WE WENT INTO THIS AND THE LOW OIL PRICE AND THEN HOW THAT FEEDS THROUGH INTO SOME OF THE GOOD THE GLOBAL GROWTH ALL THROUGHOUT AFTER CRISIS HAS BEEN A VERY WEAK RECOVERY AND IT'S REALLY STRUGGLE TO GET MOMENTUM AND YES IT DOES WE WENT IT WAS ALL RIGHT JUST GET THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED JUST GRAND U.K. EQUITY FUND MANAGER AT SCHROEDER'S
NOW DOWNTON ABBEY IT MOST CERTAINLY IS NOT RUNNING A U.K. STATELY HOME IS MORE ABOUT LEAKY ROOFS AND FALLING MASONRY AND DINNER PARTIES AND CROQUET ACCORDING TO THE HISTORIC HOUSES ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED PRIVATE CASTLES AND COUNTRY ESTATES THEY GENERATE MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS INTO HER SPENDING EACH YEAR
BUT MOST ARE SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC CASH SHORTAGES AND ARE LITERALLY CRUMBLING SO I JUMPED IN MY OWN HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE AND WENT TO VISIT ONE IN HERTFORDSHIRE
THERE WE ARE AS JOHN BETJEMAN WOULD SAY CRUNCHING OVER PRIVATE GRAVEL I'M OUTSIDE KNEBWORTH HOUSE AND HERE WITH ME I JUST LIKE YOU BOTH TO INTRODUCE YOURSELVES THAT'S HENRY LITTLE COBBOLD CURRENT CUSTODIAN OF THIS MARVELLOUS BUILDING
RICHARD CAMPED IN THE PRESIDENT OF THE HISTORIC HOUSES ASSOCIATION OH KAY AND WE ARE OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR OF THIS MAGNIFICENT BUILDING AND HENRY HOW CAN I SAY THIS IT LOOKS AS IF IT NEEDS
BIT OF WORK IF YOU NOTICED YES WELL IT'S ONE WING OF A VERY OLD HOUSE THAT'S BEEN MESSED WITH OVER THE YEARS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN WE'VE STARTED AT ONE END
AND WE'RE GRADUALLY WORKING OUR WAY ALONG WE'RE ABOUT FIVE MILLION IN THIRTY YEARS IN WE'VE GOT ABOUT HALFWAY SO SOMEHOW WE'VE GOT TO FIND ANOTHER NINE MILLION TO DO THE OTHER HALF OF THE HOUSE OH KAY AND RICHARD THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN IN TERMS OF
YOUR ORGANISATION TO TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ORGANISATION OF THE HISTORIC HOUSES ASSOCIATION AT SIXTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS LIKE HENRY LIKE KNEBWORTH AND MY OWN PLACE AND YORKSHIRE NEWBY HALL AND ALL OF THE ICONIC HOUSES THAT PEOPLE WILL AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME A STATELY HOMES LIKE BLENHEIM CHATSWORTH CASTLE HOWARD LONGLEAT TOUCHER
BUT MOST ARE NOT LIKE THAT MOST ARE WHAT I WOULD CALL THE MIDDLE RANGE TYPE OF HOUSE THAT IS THE CENTRE OF ITS COMMUNITY IT IS IS A DRIVER FOR THE RURAL ECONOMY AND WHAT IS THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE
WELL THE MEASURE INTERESTINGLY THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE IT'S MAINTAINING THESE BUILDINGS WHY DON'T PEOPLE LIKE HENRY DUST YOU KNOW SELL UP TO SOME OLIGARCH OR SELL IT TO THE NATIONAL TRUST WELL THAT FIRST OF ALL THE NATIONAL TRUST WOULDN'T TAKE IT TOO MUCH OF A LIABILITY TO MUCH OF A MONEY PIT ABSOLUTELY AND THEY'VE SAID THEY'VE STATED CATEGORICALLY THEY DON'T WANT ANY MORE HOUSES THEY ARE HUGELY EXPENSIVE THINGS TO MAINTAIN BUT THEN WE MUST ALSO LOOK UPON THESE PLACES THEM IN HER BUSINESSES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT
I MEAN THERE'S ONE BILLION POUNDS WAS SPENT VISITING H.A. H.A. PROPERTIES LAST YEAR BUT MOST OF THAT SIXTY SIX PERCENT WAS IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY AROUND IT SO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY TO THE HOUSE ITSELF IT'S THE PUBS THE B. B. M.B.A.S THE TAXES THE FORESTS
PETROL STATIONS ARE TETRA THAT SURVIVE BECAUSE OF THE KEY AND THAT IS THE HOUSE AT THE COURT IT'S THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY FOR THE WHOLE THING O.K. CAN WE GO INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK FROM THERE
WHEN THEY TOOK ME UP ON TO THAT TOP OF THE ROOF HERE
FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT YOU GET A VERY GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE STUCCO HAS FALLEN AWAY AND THE ROTTED BRICKS BENEATH ARE NOW EXPOSED AND THESE GREAT GULLIES IN THE ROOF ARE EFFECTIVELY RAIN TRAP
RICH HAVE YOU WATSON WHILE BIRTH THROUGH INTO OUR ROOMS BELOW AND RICHARD WHAT ARE YOU CALLING FOR WHAT'S THE CALL TO ARMS HERE AND TO WHOM THE CALL TO ARMS WAS ISRAELI IT'S FOR ALL OF US TO DECIDE WHETHER HOUSES LIKE KNEBWORTH NEWBY HALL MY OWN TETRA ARE WORTH PRESERVING FOR EVERYBODY'S BENEFIT SO THAT MEANS MONEY BOTTOM LINE REALLY AND WHERE IS THAT MONEY SUPPOSED TO COME FROM IS IT REGULATORY CHANGES IT TAX BREAKS OR WHAT'S THE ANSWER
WE THINK THAT THERE IS A RELATIVELY SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THIS AND WE'VE DONE THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AT THE MOMENT HERITAGE MAINTENANCE FUN'S AT THE MOMENT ARE TAXED AT FORTY FIVE PERCENT THEY SHOULD BE TAXED AT ZERO
AND THE MONEY FROM THE HERITAGE MAINTENANCE FUND WOULD BE USED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE MAINTAINING OF THE BUILDING ITSELF HERITAGE MAINTENANCE FUND WHAT IS THAT WHERE DOES IT COME FROM HOW MUCH IS IN THERE THE FUND IS SET UP BY AN OWNER
AND HIS RING FENCED ASSET LOCKED WHATEVER PHRASE YOU WANT TO USE SO IT CAN ONLY BE USED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE BUILDING AND WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT IF YOU COULD I MEAN WHO IS THE PERSON TO WHOM YOU HAVE TO APPEAL TO GET THE THING THAT YOU WANT
I SUPPOSE ULTIMATELY EVERYTHING STOPS FOR THE TREASURY DOESN'T IT THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF HERITAGE BEING SUPPORTIVE I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT TREASURY DOES GET AND MY JOB IS TO REMIND EVERYBODY JUST HOW IMPORTANT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS IT REPRESENTS TWO THIRDS OF HERITAGE
THEY WERE MORE THAN NATIONAL TRUST ENGLISH HERITAGE AND THEIR EQUIVALENTS IN SCOTLAND WALES NORTHERN IRELAND ALL PUT TOGETHER I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU'RE NOT COMPETING ON AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD WITH NATIONAL TRUST
BROADLY YES I MEAN I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THAT AS WELL THEY DON'T PAY INCOME TAX THAT WE DO IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT THERE WAS RICHARD COMES AND PRESENT HISTORIC HOUSES ASSOCIATION WHO WAS ALSO THERE WITH HENRY LYTTON COBBOLD WHO'S THE OWNER OF KNEBWORTH HOUSE IN HERTFORDSHIRE AND WHEN I ASKED HIM I SAID HAVEN'T YOU GOT ANYTHING OF VALUE AND TITIAN OR AN EL GRECO KNOCKING AROUND IN THERE
ANYTHING OF VALUE TO YOU COULD SELL IT AS A MATTER OF FACT I HAVENAE PULLED OUT A PAIR OF NICK MICK JAGGER'S UNDERPANTS WHICH HE LEFT THERE AFTER A GIG IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES LOVINGLY WITH A PLAQUE AND PUT BEHIND IN FRAMED SO I'M OLD TWEET A PICTURE OF THAT FOR YOU COS IT IS WORTH SEEING I'LL PUT IT ON THAT SIMON CHECKED COLOUR UP THEIR BRIGHT RED WHERE THE SEVENTIES FOR YOU THEY MAKE HER LIKE THAT

WAS HE INVOLVED WITH THIS GIRL OR NOT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SETTLED BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IT IS PURELY A TECHNICAL MATTER OF WAS HE SPOKEN TO AT THE TIME BY THE B.B.C. BOSS AND ALSO AN INDEPENDENT Q.C. WHO WAS LOOKING INTO THIS OR WAS HE NOT SO IT SEEMS TO BE A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN WHAT DAME JANET SMITH HAS CONCLUDED
AND WHAT HE SAYS WITH A VERSION OF BEDS BUT IN NINETY DESTROY HIM OR DID A DISCREPANCY IN A DISCRIMINATE SERIOUS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BE SACKED OVER IT WELL NO CONFIRMATION FROM THE B. B. C. THAT HE HAS BEEN SACKED BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATEMENT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT HE BELIEVES HE'S BEEN SACKED HE SAID HE'S DEVASTATED HIM IS ALSO CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION OVER THE MATTER IT'S
ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THERE WILL BE A FULL ACCOUNT OF THIS AFTER TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE DAME JANET SMITH ENQUIRY THIS LONG AWAITED THREE YEAR INQUIRY INTO THE B.B.C. AND JIMMY SEVERAL AND STUART HALL WILL BE MADE PUBLIC AND CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS TO THE DIRECTOR GENERAL'S TO EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THAT TONY BLACKMAN TODAY WELL WE HAVE ASKED THE B. B. C. FOR AN INTERVIEW BUT WE GOT THE SAME RESPONSE THAT YOU HAVE WHICH IS THAT THEY'RE NOT SAYING ANYTHING UNTIL THE STATEMENT IT COMES OUT LATER ON THIS MORNING DAVID SAID IT OH THANK YOU
THE TIME TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES UNTIL THE TELECOM REGULATOR OFCOM ANNOUNCES ITS VIEW ON WHETHER OPENREACH THE COMPANY THAT'S IN CHARGE OF LAYING OUT BROADBAND COVERAGE SHOULD BE SPLIT OFF FROM B.T. ROY CATON JONES OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT IS HERE AND EVERYONE EXPECTS STORY THAT THEY WILL NOT GO THAT FAR WELL A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM ANGRY CUSTOMERS ANGRY
PARTNERS OF B.T. COMPANIES LIKE SKY AND TALKTALK WHICH BASICALLY RELY ON OPENREACH WHICH IS THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE IN PRITPAL BROADBAND THE COMPANY THAT EFFECTIVELY LAYS THE NETWORK ACROSS THE U.K. THEY'RE SAYING THE SERVICE HAS BEEN POOR
AND THAT BEATTIE HASN'T INVESTED ENOUGH IN GIVING BRITAIN THE KIND OF SUPER FAST BROADBAND NETWORK IT NEEDS THEY WANTED IT SPLIT UP COMPLETELY ALL THE MOOD MUSIC WE GETTING SUGGEST OFCOM WILL NOT GO THAT FAR WHY NOT
BECAUSE I THINK THEY MAY THEY JUST THINK IT'S TOO MUCH OF A LEAP IN THE DARK A B.T. IS ARGUED THROUGHOUT THAT IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD THERE BE NO SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES OF THIS KIND OF SPLIT OFF OTHERS ARE SAYING IT IT WORKED IN OTHER INDUSTRIES OTHER UTILITIES AND THEREFORE IT'S THE SENSIBLE MOVED AND THE QUESTION OFCOM WILL HAVE ASKED THEMSELVES IS IS THERE ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE INVESTMENT
IN BROADBAND IN THE U.K. WILL BE TEA ONCE IT'S SPLIT UP OR PUT MORE MONEY INTO LAYING FIBRES ACROSS THE COUNTRY OR WILL THEY NOT AND I THINK IT'S LIKELY THAT GROUP CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE THAT THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN BUT THEY WILL IMPOSE I SUSPECT MUCH TIGHTER
REGULATION ON OPENREACH TO TRY AND MAKE SURE IT'S MORE FUNCTIONALLY SEPARATED FROM FROM B.T. WHAT MEANING THAT THERE ISN'T SO MUCH OF A CROSS SUBSIDISE ESHEN THEN YEAH I MEAN THE CLAIM WHICH B.T.'S ALWAYS DENIED IT IS THAT IT'S USED OPENREACH IS A CURRENT CASH COW IT'S MADE HUGE PROFITS AND IT SPENT THAT MONEY ON THINGS LIKE BUYING SPORTS RIGHTS BEATTY DENIES THAT BOAT INTERESTING A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO B.T.'S BOSS
WAS SUGGESTING THAT IF EVERYTHING WENT WELL THEY WOULD INVEST ANOTHER BILLION POUNDS IN THE NETWORK SO BY MAGIC IF I LIKE TONGUE SUDDENLY SUDDENLY THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE MONEY GOING TOWARDS RUB A LOT ABOUT A LOT OF THIS IS ACTUALLY AN ARGUMENT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY B.T.'S CRITICS SAY YOU SHOULD BE LAYING FIBRE OPTICS RIGHT INTO THE HOME BEATTIE IS MOSTLY SAID THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
WE LAY IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO CABINETS AND THAT GIVES A GOOD ENOUGH SIR ROY THANK YOU WILL BE TALKING TO SHOWER MY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF COME AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK AND TO A CRITIC OF B.T. AND THEIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE ARDLEY

THEY PROBABLY KNOW THIS ALREADY WHEN PEOPLE CALL THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THE MOTHER OF PARLIAMENTS FAIRER MISQUOTING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY RADICAL JOHN BRIGHT IS IT ENGLAND WAS THE MOTHER OF PARLIAMENTS PLENTY OF PEOPLE BANDING THE EXPRESSION ROUND THERE YESTERDAY WHEN P.M.Q.S BRIEFLY STOOD FOR POLITICIANS MUM'S QUOTES FROM WESTMINSTER HE'S OUR PARLIAMENT SHE CORRESPONDENT
THE DEBATE ABOUT THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE FORTHCOMING REFERENDUM AS WESTMINSTER FIRMLY IN ITS GRIP BUT THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE HEALTH SERVICE DURING THE COURSE OF HIS QUESTIONS HE SAID THE N.H.S. TRUST IN DAVID CAMERON'S CONSTITUENCY HAD OVERSPENT ON STAFFING COSTS BY ELEVEN MILLION POUNDS
HAS MANAGED TO SPEND THIRTY MILLION ON AGENCY STAFF WILL BE CHAIR OF THE OXFORD ANTI AUSTERITY CAMPAIGN WRITING ANOTHER LETTER TO HIMSELF
THAT WAS A DIG AT THE PRIME MINISTER BECAUSE IT EMERGED LAST YEAR THAT MY CAMERON HAD WRITTEN TO HIS LOCAL COUNCIL COMPLAINING ABOUT CUTS TO SERVICES I'M VERY PROUD OF THE N.H.S. IN OXFORDSHIRE AND EVERYONE WHO WORKS IN IT AND HAVING MET RECENTLY WIN
THE HEAD OF THE ORCHARD RADCLIFFE TRUST I KNOW THAT HE SUPPORTS THIS MOVE TOWARDS MORE SEVEN DAY SERVICES EARLIER THIS MONTH WE LEARNT THAT DAVID CAMERON'S MOTHER HAD SIGNED A PETITION AGAINST CUTS TO CHILDREN'S SERVICES AS THE PRIME MINISTER TALKED ABOUT THE N.H.S. IN HIS SEAT A LABOUR M.P. CAROLINE HARRIS WHO WAS SITTING JUST BEHIND JEREMY CORBIN SHOUTED OUT ASK YOUR MOTHER
ASK MY MOTHER I THINK I KNOW WHAT MY MOTHER WOULD SAY I THINK SHE'D LOOK ACROSS THE DISPATCH BOX AND PUT ON A PROPER SUIT DO UP YOUR TIME

EITHER WAY MY CAMERON PROMPTLY SAT DOWN THE SPEAKER CALLED JEREMY CORBIN
HE'S WEARING A LIGHT BROWN JACKET AND DARK TROUSERS AND A RED TIE BUT THE LABOUR LEADER THEN FOUND HE HAD TO WAIT AT THE DESPATCH BOX FOR THE CONSERVATIVE LAUGHTER TO DIE DOWN
SOME TORY M.P.S WAVED THEIR ORDER PAPERS ONE OR TWO EVEN SLAPPED THEIR THIGHS THE NOISE INCREASED WHEN LABOUR M.P.S BEGAN TO SHOUT AT THE CONSERVATIVES CALLING THEM BULLINGDON BOYS
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MONEY ADVICE MY LATE MOTHER WOULD HAVE SAID

JEREMY CORBIN BEGAN THE EXCHANGES BY ASKING ABOUT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS' ROW IN ENGLAND HE SAID A STAFF SURVEY SHOWED THAT NINE OUT OF TEN JUNIOR DOCTORS ALREADY WORKED EXTRA HOURS BEYOND THEIR NORMAL CONTRACT AND SUGGESTED THEIR MORALE WAS FALLING
WHAT DOES THE PRIME MINISTER THINK THE HEALTH SECRETARIES VETO OF A DEAL AND THE POSITION OF A CONTRACT WILL DO TO THEM
THIS PROMPTED SOME VIGOROUS HEAD SHAKING BY THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT WHO WAS STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE CHAMBER RATHER THAN SITTING ON THE FRONT BENCH ALONGSIDE DAVID CAMERON AND OTHER MINISTERS FIRST ALL THE HEALTH SECRETARY DID NOT VITO A DEAL WHAT
WHAT WE'VE HAD IS FOR FOUR YEARS DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE AN N.H.S. THAT WORKS ON A MORE SEVEN DAY BASIS
THERE WAS MORE HEAD SHAKING WHEN THE LABOUR LEADER ACCUSE JEREMY HUNT OF USING MISLEADING FIGURES ABOUT WEEKEND DEATH RATES IN HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND THIS DISPUTE WITH THE JUNIOR DOCTORS HAS BEEN ON THE BASIS OF MISREPRESENTED RESEARCH
LAST JULY JEREMY HUNT SAID THEY WERE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DEATHS A YEAR BECAUSE THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND DIDN'T OFFER WHAT HE CALLED A PROPER SEVEN DAY SERVICE THE HEALTH SECRETARY WAS INDEED GUILTY
HE WAS GUILTY OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT THE TRUE RIGOURS FOR EXCESS DEATHS AT THE WEEKEND I ELEVEN THOUSAND NOT SIX

IT IS THE LAST DAY OF CAMPAIGNING AND ISLANDS GENERAL ELECTION IT WAS ONCE KNOWN AS THE CELTIC TIGER ENJOYING UNDREAMT OF ECONOMIC SUCCESS THEN THE BUBBLE BURST IRELAND'S BANKS ALMOST WENT UNDER IN THE STATE HAD TO GO BEGGING TO THE E.U. AND THE I.M.F. FOR A BAILOUT NOW IRELAND IS IN THE MIDST OF A NEW BOOM IN HAS THE HIGHEST GROWTH RATE IN EUROPE BUT IT'S JOHNNY DIAMOND REPORTS FROM DUBLIN THE ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE OF TWENTY TEN CASTS A LONG SHADOW
JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION AND A BIG DEMONSTRATION IS SNAKING ITS WAY THROUGH CENTRAL DUBLIN PROTESTING
AGAINST THE HATED WATER CHARGES SWAT OF A SLEW OF TAXES AND CHARGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT
BROUGHT IN TO TRY AND BALANCE THE BOOKS AFTER THE NEAR COLLAPSE OF PRETTY MUCH EVERY IRIS
DESPITE THE ROWS ECONOMIC FIGURES AND THEY ARE GOOD AUSTERITY HAS BROUGHT CONSIDERABLE PAIN TO IRELAND PAIN BUT HAS LED TO DEMONSTRATIONS LIKE THESE PASTE DIRECT TAXES ON ORDINARY FAMILIES SKEWED AND
I JUST I JUST DON'T AGREE WITH HER TO PINNED ON THE CITY'S DOES COVER PART OF HADES THING I CAN JUST IT'S ALL RIGHT
JUST A FEW STEPS AWAY FROM THE MARKS AND A DIFFERENT DUBLIN OR NEW DUBLIN NEW RESTAURANTS NEW BARS NEW MONEY A LOT OF
MONEY TECHNOLOGY HAS DRIVEN THE EXPORT LED RECOVERY HERE BOTH BIG AMERICAN TECH COMPANIES ENTICED BY TAX INCENTIVES AND A WELL EDUCATED WORKFORCE
A HOST OF LOCAL START UPS PAUL ADAMS VICE PRESIDENT OF INTERCOM
EXPLAINS WHAT MAKES DUBLIN GOOD FOR HIS COMPANY THE FACT THAT GOOGLE FACEBOOK AND SO ON ARE BUILDING BIG OPERATIONS HERE
CREATES THIS GREAT TECHNOLOGY SCENE UNTIL THERE IS A GREAT TECHNOLOGY CENTRE THERE ARE MANY MANY MANY GOOD START UPS HERE GOOD COMPANIES HERE THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HERE AND SORT ATTRACTIVE IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO COME TO
PEOPLE WHO JOIN US DON'T FEEL LIKE THE COVERS WERE TECHNOLOGICAL BACKWATER AND I PERSONALLY I WORKED FOR FACEBOOK AND SAN FRANCISCO AND MOVED BACK TO DUBLIN AND CLEARLY WAS MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO DO THAT KNOWING IT WAS IN THE TECHNOLOGY SENIOR
TONIGHT IT'S THE FINAL LEADERS' DEBATE OF ELECTION TWENTY SIXTEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE PARTY LEADERS CLASHED ON THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY
UNEMPLOYMENT IS WELL DOWN FROM THE FIFTEEN PER CENT IT REACHED THAT
GROWTH WAS A STUNNING SEVEN PER CENT LAST YEAR LITTLE SURPRISE THEN THE TALK OF THE CELTIC PHOENIX BUT TONY FOLEY SENIOR LECTURER IN ECONOMICS AT DUBLIN CITY UNIVERSITY COUNSELS CAUTION
WE HAVE HAD SUCH A DISMAL PERFORMANCE IN YEARS PREVIOUSLY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED A GROAT
SO THE GOOD THING IS THAT THEIR MESS IS CORRECT THE DECLINE IS REVERSED THE PUBLIC FINANCES ARE FIXED UP WE ARE HAVING SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT BUT THAT DOES NOT WIPE AWAY ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE THINGS WE HAD TO INTRODUCE
AND THAT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO REVERSE ALL YEAH AND IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO KEEP TOGETHER
ALAN'S WELFARE STATE WAS ACTUALLY BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE AT BEDROOM JUST OFF TO THE LEFT THEIR COMBINATION BEDROOM RIGHT BRIAN HOGAN IS C. E. OF DON BOSCO CARE WHICH PROVIDES A RANGE OF SERVICES TO SOME OF DUBLIN'S MOST TROUBLED YOUNG PEOPLE
WE'VE HAD COTS ON COTS SINCE TWENTY TEN THE MONEY JUST RAN OCEAN ON WE WERE IN A POSITION TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO WHERE WE WERE QUESTIONING OUR SUSTAINABILITY AND WHETHER WE'D BE ABLE TO KEEP GOING I'M NOT DOES THE WHOLE IRISH ECONOMY RECEIVED A SORT OF US A SCATHING SERIES OF COURTS AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH THEY WOULD WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE EARLIEST AND THE MOST LONG LASTING EFFECTS OF THE COT
CAPTAIN SEA
THERE ARE A LOT OF DEEPLY DISILLUSIONED PEOPLE IN IRELAND
THE BIG ECONOMIC NUMBERS AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH THE DEFICIT ARE CONSIDERING THE CATASTROPHE OF TWENTY TEN PRETTY GOOD
THE PRICE HAS BEEN HIGH BRUTAL LEVER IN THE FEELING OF A COUNTRY DIVIDED RUNS VERY DEEP
JOHNNY DIAMOND REPORTING FROM IRELAND THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN JUST UNDER FOUR MONTHS TIME THE U.K. AS WE ALL KNOW WHO'S GOING TO DECIDE ON WHETHER WE NEED WILL REMAIN IN THE E.U. AND OF COURSE IT WON'T BE THE POLITICIANS OF THE CAMPAIGNERS ARE GOING TO HAVE THE FINAL SAY IT WILL BE US IT WILL BE THE VOTERS BETWEEN NOW AND THE REFERENDUM WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE
WHO ARE UP AND ABOUT WHO ARE DOING THINGS AT THE TIME THAT WE ARE ON AIR AND NICK HAS GONE THIS MORNING TO SWINDON TO START THE PROCESS OF HAVING THOSE TALKS MORNING
MORNING JUSTIN HERE'S OPEN ABOUT THEY ARE YOU MAY HEAR THE COWS IN THE DISTANCE HERE JUST YOU MAY HEAR THE BIRDS GLORIOUS DAWN CHORUS HERE COS I'M A BRINK WITH DAIRY NEAR CHIPPENHAM IN WILTSHIRE THE SUN HAS JUST RIDDEN RISEN A SPECTACULAR SIGHT AND WE'RE HERE TO TALK TO TWO FARMERS WHO GOING TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES HERE I'D CRY
I'M KERRY OF BRINKER DAIRY NO SENSE WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IT'S NOT JUST YOUR OPINION BUT HOW THE E.U. AFFECTS YOU NOW BECAUSE THAT WILL SHAPE HOW ARE YOU HOW OTHER PEOPLE MAKE YOUR DECISIONS YOU DAIRY FARMERS BUT YOU'RE ALSO CHEESE MANUFACTURES KERRY SO DAY TODAY IS THE BIG PART OF YOUR LIFE
WE DECIDE TO ADD VALUE TO OUR PRODUCTS BY MAKING CHEESE YOGHURT CREAM MILK BUTTER
AND THERE IS A LOT OF PAPERWORK INVOLVED IN RUNNING A FARM
GENERALLY IT'S MY MOTHER THAT DOES ALL THE PAPERWORK AND I KNOW SHE SURE DOES COMPLAIN ABOUT DOING A LOT SO I DO THINK THERE IS A LOT BUT HERE I CAN SEE ONE OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL CHEESES HERE TO DO THAT WHAT IS BRUSSELS BEFORE YOU CAN SELL AT WHAT IS BRUSSELS TELL YOU'VE GOT TO DO SO THERE ARE REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR CHEESE FOR EXAMPLE THE LABELLING REGULATIONS THAT HAVE COME IN RECENTLY THAT SPECIFY WHAT HAS TO BE ON THE LABEL AND
I THINK THAT THERE YEAH THERE IS THERE A KIND OF HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH LESS HEAPS AND THEN GIVE MY CUSTOMERS LESS INFORMATION THAN OTHER PLACES ARE ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS ALTHOUGH LITERALLY BRUSSELS BUREAUCRACY WILL TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE THE CHEESE HOW TO LABEL THE CHEESE YOUR INSTINCT IS IF WE WERE HOUSE IT JUST BE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TELL YOU DO SOMETHING PRETTY
WHAT YOU TYPICALLY ON REGULATIONS THAT COME FROM BRUSSELS OUR FEELING IS THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT APPLIES THEM RIGOUROUSLY AND APPLIES THEM IMMEDIATELY WHEREAS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THEY MIGHT TAKE TEN YEARS BEFORE THEY PHASE IN THOSE REGULATIONS AND THEY MIGHT NOT PUSH FOR THEM SO MUCH NOW TURN ON THE FARMING SIDE ON THE DAIRY SIDE AGAIN PRESUMABLY AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BRUSSELS REGULATION AFFECTION YES AND AGAIN LIKE CARRIE SAID I THINK WE'VE PROBABLY
MAINTAIN A HIGHER WELFARE STANDARD HERE LET'S SET BY OURSELVES
BUT THEN WE ARE COMPETING IN A MARKET WHERE MAYBE WELFARE STANDARDS AREN'T SO GOOD BUT FOR THE GRANTS YOU GET WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY OFTEN FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS AGAIN SET BY BRUSSELS YES
THINGS LIKE LOOKING AFTER THE HEDGEROWS LOOKING AFTER THE FIELDS MAKING SURE THE ANIMALS ARE SORT OF MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE N. NICE WAY DO YOU TEN THE TWO OF YOU TO CURSE BRUSSELS UNDER YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU SAY MY GOD WITHOUT THEIR SUPPORT WE FRANKLY WOULD NOT HAVE THE MONEY WE NEED TO KEEP A FARM LIKE THIS GET ME
I THINK IT'S A LEAP INTO THE GREAT UNKNOWN IF WE VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. I'M NOT SURE I KNOW WHAT WE'RE WAITING FOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT SUPPORT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WOULD GIVE FARMERS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRADING POLICY WOULD BE I DON'T KNOW IT'LL BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO TRADE WITH THE E.U. DO YOU INSTINCTIVELY THINK CARRIE THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ON ITS OWN WITHOUT BEING AS IT WERE PART OF A BIGGER CLUB WOULD BE MORE OR LESS GENEROUS
I SUSPECT THAT IN THESE TIMES WHEN EVERYBODY'S TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS I DON'T EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE SUPPORT COMING FOR FARMERS FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
IT SCARES ME IS THAT A WORRY FOR YOU CHAP I THINK FOOD IS SUCH AN IM IF SUCH A CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE THE NATION I DON'T THINK ANY GOVERNMENT WOULD SACRIFICE ANY PART OF POO PRODUCTION WOULDN'T SUPPORT IT
BUT IN POLAND AND FRANCE IS OFTEN MORE SUPPORT FOR FARMERS IN THERE IS HERE ISN'T IT THAT'S RIGHT YEAH PEOPLE ARE CLOSER TO THE LAND AND OTHER COUNTRIES ONE GENERATION AWAY FROM THE LAND HERE IN BRITAIN WE TYPICALLY THREE GENERATIONS AWAY FROM THE LAD I'M NOT SURE THAT PEOPLE CARE AS MUCH ONE WORD EACH IF YOU KNOW YET HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR VOTE AND DECIDED BUT TENDING TOWARDS
CAN I GO AND DECIDED TENDING TOWARDS THAT INDEED WELL THERE WE ARE WE'RE AT LISTENING TO THE COWS HERE JUSTIN AND MICHELLE WERE ABOUT TO TASTE GLORIOUS BIT OF BRINK WITH BALOO FROM BRYN WORTH DAIRY AS WELL AND THEN WE'RE HEADING OFF LATER IN THE PROGRAMME

PLANE MADE BRITS HISTORY WHEN THEY PICKED UP THE BRITISH GROUP AWARD BY BEING THE BAND TO HAVE WON THE MOST BRITS EVER AND A FITTING TRIBUTE TO DAVID BOWIE BY HIS CLOSE FRIEND AND ACTOR GARY OLDMAN
SINGER LORD PERFORM LIFE ON MARS WITH HIS
WHICH IS IN HDU REPORTING ON LAST NIGHT AT THE BRIT AWARDS THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN TONY BLACKBURN SAYS HE IS BEING SACKED BY THE B.B.C. BECAUSE OF A DISAGREEMENT OVER EVIDENCE GIVEN TO THE JANE THAT DAME JANET SMITH REVIEW INTO JIMMY SADDLE AND THE B.B.C. RADIO TWO BROADCASTER HAS BEEN AT THE CORPORATION FOR FORTY NINE YEARS HE HAS TWICE BEEN GIVEN A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT SONY RADIO WARD AFTER THE SECOND ONE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN HE SPOKE TO EDDIE MAIR ON P.M.
I THINK I'M PROBABLY HAPPIER NOW THAN I EVER HAVE BEEN BECAUSE I I WORK FOR SIX RADIO STATIONS INCLUDING RADIO TWO AND SOME B.B.C. LOCAL RADIO SOME IN NATIONAL AND LOCAL RADIO WHICH THAT I WORK FOR SOME LOVELY PEOPLE AND IT JUST GIVES ME A LOT OF PLEASURE YOU'RE FAR TOO SMART TO TELL ME WHICH YOU PREFER BETWEEN WORKING FOR THE B. B. C. OR WORKING FOR COMMERCIAL RADIO BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT O.K.
B. B. C. I LIKE BOTH IT'S NICE TO WORK FOR BOTH BUT I'VE ALWAYS HAD A DEEP LOVE OF THE B. B. C. RIGHT FROM THE WORD GO AND IT'S A VERY SPECIAL ORGANISATION
WELL I SUSPECT HE FEELS RATHER DIFFERENTLY THIS MORNING A TONY BLACKMAN STATEMENTS IN THE DAILY MIRROR WE HAVE ASKED THE B.B.C. FOR AN INTERVIEW OR EVEN TO CONFIRMED THAT TONY BLACKBURN HAS BEEN SACKED BUT THEY ARE NOT SAYING ANYTHING UNTIL THE REPORT IS PUBLISHED AT TEN A.M. WE'RE JOINED BY STEVE HEWLETT PRESENTER OF THE MEDIA SHOW ON RADIO FOUR GOOD MORNING MORNING THERE APPEAR TO BE TWO VERSIONS OF EVENTS AT THE HEART OF THIS ABOUT HOW AN INCIDENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE WAS HANDLED
IT'S A CONCERNS ONE UNCLE CLAIRE MCALPINE WHO WAS FIFTEEN AT THE TIME WHO CLAIM TO HAVE BEEN IN HER DIARY CLAIM TO HAVE BEEN SEDUCED BY A NUMBER OF CELEBRITIES ONE OF WHOM WAS ALLEGED TO BE TONY BLACKBURN THE MOTHER HER MOTHER APPROACH TO B. B. C. WITH THIS COMPLAINT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT THING IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CELEBRITIES MALE OR NOT OF BEING IT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT'S ONE CASE WHERE THE B.B.C. SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EVEN THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT INITIALLY DECIDED TO DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN TOLD THAT A SEXUAL OFFENCE HAD TAKEN PLACE
AS TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO TONY BLACKBURN SINCE TO BE HONEST WE KNOW NO MORE THAN THAN YOU HAVE PUT IN YOUR INTRODUCTION WAS HE INTERVIEWED BY PEOPLE OR NOT HE SAYS HE WAS NOT INTERVIEWED BY THESE PEOPLE THERE WAS A SUBSEQUENT ENQUIRY HE SAYS HE WASN'T INTERVIEWED BY THESE PEOPLE ALTHOUGH HE CRITICALLY SAYS IN THIS CONTEXT
THIS A BIT OF PERHAPS IN THE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE AS TO WHETHER YOU HAVE OR SPOKE TO THEM AT ALL BUT THE MESSAGE FROM HIM IS HE WAS NOT INTERVIEWED MISS CONTEXT BY THESE PEOPLE DAME JANET SMITH REPORT WE UNDERSTAND SAYS THAT HE WAS NOW IF HE WERE IF IF JOHNNY DANGER SMITH HAS PROOF THAT HE WAS INTERVIEWED AND HE SAYING HE WASN'T
THAT WILL BE WHY THEY'VE SACKED IF INDEED THEY HAVE AND HE SAYS HE'S NOT GUILTY OF ANY INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT A BIT AT THE KEY BIT AS YOU SAID IS THE PROOF BECAUSE WHAT WERE RECORDS LIKE RECORD KEEPING LIKE IT WELL WHO KNOWS BUT I THINK THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE IN THE MEMBER WE WE HAVE SEEN A LEAKED COPY OF THE JAMES SMITH REPORT WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO RUN IS A THOUSAND PAGES FOUR VOLUMES IN THE LATE VERSION HAS HAS THE B. B. C. WITH WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS A DEFERENTIAL CULTURE UNTOUCHABLE STARS MANAGERS WHO BELIEVE THEY WERE ABOVE THE LAW AND ALL THESE THINGS COMBINED
TO ALLOW SADDLE TO ABUSE ALMOST AT WILL WITHER AND MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO CATCH HIM STOP HIM WHATEVER WERE WERE WERE MISSED AND CRITICALLY
THERE ARE BUT THERE WERE ALSO SAYS IF THE LEAK VERSION SKIRT IS ANYTHING TO GO BY BUT NO SPECIFIC MANAGER EVER KNEW ANYTHING THEY SHOULD HAVE ACTED ON AND THEN THERE WAS THE MANAGEMENT ARE EXONERATED FOR THE CULTURE WAS HEAVILY CRITICISED THE SHARP END OF THIS IF I MAY SAY MIGHT THIS IS VERY BAD FOR THE RECEIPTS VERY AT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE B. B. C.
AS AN INSTITUTION THAT WE ALL GREW UP WITH LOVE AND CHERISH YOU THIS IS EATING AWAY AT THE GROUTING IS QUICK THIS IS A BIT LIKE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND CHILD ABUSE THIS IS NOT NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR THE B. B. C. TO BE BETA IT'S UNPLEASANT READING BUT THE CRITICAL THING IS THAT JANE JANET SAYS IN THE CAUSE OF HER INQUIRIES TODAY INTO WHAT WENT ON WITH SUPPER
THAT PEOPLE EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT TALKING TO THAT THEIR PEOPLE WERE STILL WORRIED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THEM PERSONALLY OF SPEAKING OUT EVEN NOW NOW THE B. B. C. WILL CLAIM WITH SOME JUSTICE THAT THEY HAVE INDUSTRY LEADING CHILD PROTECTION PROCEDURES WHISTLE BLOWING HOT LINES AND ALL REST OF IT I'M SURE TONY ORDER GENERAL WILL BE ABSOLUTELY MORTIFIED IF HE REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE FELT THEY COULDN'T SPEAK OUT WHAT SHE FOUND WAS THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON PEOPLE WERE RELUCTANT TO SPEAK OUT AND OF COURSE THE CRITICAL THING ABOUT THAT IS
THAT IS THE KEY INGREDIENT NECESSARY FOR THE KIND OF THINGS THAT SELL THE WORK DUE TO HAPPEN OR AS AS I SAID NO ONE AT THE B. B. C. IS AVAILABLE FOR AN INTERVIEW THIS MORNING TONY BLACKBURN SAYS HE'S NOT GUILTY OF ANY INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT STEVE HEWLETT THANK YOU WELCOME THIRTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN ANYONE WITH A BROADBAND INTERNET CONNECTION HAS AN INTEREST IN THE NEWS THE BROOCH A STAIRWELL THIRTY MINUTES AGO REALLY SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THE PUBLICATION OF THE LONG AWAITED RATHER DRY SOUNDING OFCOM STRATEGIC REVIEW OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS BUT IT IS ANYTHING BUT DRY IT CONTAINS
WITHIN THAT REVIEW OFCOM'S VERDICT ON B.T. OPENREACH OPENREACH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LAYING OUT BROADBAND IT BELONGS TO B.T. LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING AND SUGGESTING THAT IT SHOULD NOT IN THE FUTURE WE WILL TALK TO SHARON WHITE THE BOSS OF COMMON JUST ASCEND THE FIRST SIMON JACKETS HERE IS JUST TO RUN THROUGH WHAT YOU HAVE READ SO FAR OF WHAT OFCOM IN THIS REPORT A SEC YEAH AS YOU RIGHTLY SAY THIS IS THE BITS OF B.T. THAT OWNS THE CABLES THAT BRING TELEPHONE AND BROADBAND CONNECTIONS
INTO OUR HOMES ALL THE OTHER SERVICE PROVIDER SKY TALK TALK VODAFONE AND THE LIKE HAVE TO PAID B.T. FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF USING THE CABLES THEY DON'T LIKE THAT WHAT IS IT ANTI COMPETITIVE THEY SAY IT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST NOW IN THE OFCOM'S RULING THEY SAY YES THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST HERE OPENREACH STILL HAS AN INCENTIVE TO MAKES DECISIONS THAT BENEFIT BE TEA SOMETIMES OVER ITS RIVALS WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO ABOUT IT SPLIT OFF NO THEY'RE NOT
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO HIS OVERHAUL THE GOVERNMENT'S GIVEN A SEPARATE BOARD MORE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN BUDGET INVESTMENT AND STRATEGY THAT THEY SAY EXACTLY HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO THIS THEY'LL DEVELOP SOME MORE DETAILED PROPOSALS LATER ON THIS YEAR IT MAY BUT THEY MAY RING FENCE IT WILL IT'S TOTALLY WITH A WHOLLY HOLY INTERCITY OF B.T.
BUT HE'S THE HE'S THE HE'S THE STICK OFCOM RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SPIN IT OFF IF THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN SO THERE IS THE IMPLIED THREAT BUT ALL IN ALL I THINK THAT THE B.T.'S RIVALS WILL THINK THIS DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH AND I THINK BEATTY MIGHT BREATHE A BIT OF A SIGH OF RELIEF SIMON THANKS LET'S TALK TO SAM MY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFCOM IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU AND YOU'VE BOTTLED IT HAVEN'T YOU
I DISAGREE IN TODAY WE ARE ANNOUNCING THREE MAJOR REFORMS TO TRANSFORM PHONE AND BROADBAND EVERY INDIVIDUAL AND BUSINESS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY
FIRST YOU HAVE PICKED UP ALREADY IS THAT WE WILL BE MAKING OPENREACH MORE INDEPENDENT IT WILL HAVE TO BEHAVE BE SEEN TO BEHAVE LIKE AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY IF THAT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP ALL FAIR AND GOOD IF NOT WE DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SPIN THE COMPANY OFF
SECOND REALLY IMPORTANT WE WILL BE OPENING UP OPEN BEACHES NETWORK THOSE UNDERGROUND TUNNEL THAT WE WALK OVER MANHOLE COVERS ALSO TELEGRAPH POLES SO THAT OTHER COMPANIES CAN COME IN AND LAY FAST FIBRE OPTIC CABLES RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR MY BUSINESS AND THIRD AND VERY CRITICALLY I'M SURE FOR LOTS OF LISTENERS IN WE WILL BE
PUTTING A VERY STRONG FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SERVICE SO PERFORMANCE TABLES FOR PROVIDERS COMPENSATION IF THINGS DO GO WRONG AUTOMATIC COMPENSATION TO PEOPLE IN BUSINESSES AND TOUGHER MINIMUM WHY DIDN'T YOU GO AS FAR AS PEOPLE LIKE SKY AND TALKED ALL WANTED YOU TO GO AND SIMPLY SAY OFCOM WE WE WANT YOU TO BE SEPARATE WE'RE CLEAR TODAY IS THAT OPEN BEACH DOES NEED
MAJOR REFORM AND THAT MADE I SAY OFCOM OPEN YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT OVER OVER REACH DOES NEED MAJOR REFORM AND THE KEY THING IS THAT ITS INDEPENDENCE OF IT RESPONDS TO ALL THESE CUSTOMERS NOT JUST B.T. BUT WHAT'S WOWING BANKSY'S NOT OPERATED SO WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SEPARATE WHY NOT DO IT NOW WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SEPARATE IF WE CANNOT GET THE INDEPENDENCE THAT WE ARE SEEKING IF WE CANNOT GET THE RESPONSIVENESS TO CAN SUSS CUSTOMERS THAT WE'RE SEEKING
THEN ABSOLUTELY WE WILL WE WILL COME IN AND WE RESERVE THE RIGHT FOR ME TO SEPARATE HOW LONG AS THEY'VE GOT TO TRY TO SHOW YOU AND TO SHOW US THAT IT'S HER DOING A DIFFERENT SORT OF JOB WILL BE DEVELOPING PROPOSALS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS BUT TO GIVE YOU A GOOD TEST OF THAT WHEN WE OPEN BEACH DECIDES WHERE HE'S GOING TO LAY ITS SUPERFAST BROADBAND OR WHEN IT DECIDES WHAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE INTO CHARGED WHETHER
IT IS TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE VIEWS NOT JUST OF B.T. BUT ALL ITS CUSTOMER WHAT THE CUSTOMERS WANT TO KNOW IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING THAT AND KEEPING A SPECIAL EYE ON THEM NOW WHAT WHAT IS THAT THE TIME FRAME IS IT TO DO YOU GOING TO LOOK AGAIN IN A YEAR HE CAN LOOK AGAIN IN TWO YEARS FIVE WE WILL I'VE GOT TO SORT WE WE WILL OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS
BE COMING FORWARD WITH PROPOSALS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN SEEK THE INDEFINITE AFTER THOSE PROPOSALS HAVE COME IN IF THEY'VE GOT IF WE IF THOSE PROPOSALS DON'T DELIVER THE INDEPENDENCE THAT WE ARE SEEKING THEN WE WILL COME BACK WITH MORE WHEN I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHEN WHEN YOU'LL COME BACK WHEN AND IN A YEAR'S TIME WE WERE YOUNGER THEY GOT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THIS AS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BUT WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASISE TODAY IS THAT AS WELL AS THE CHANGES TO THE GOVERNANCE OF OPENREACH
WHAT WE THINK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST RELYING ON THE OPENREACH NETWORK AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE BEEN OTHER PROVIDERS ABLE TO COMING USE IN THESE UNDERGROUND TUNNELS THESE TELEGRAPH POLES MEANS THAT I'VE GOT A CHOICE BETWEEN APRIL MEETS BETWEEN THIRTY AND WE'VE STILL GOT OPEN REACHES HUGE BEAR MOUTH AND OTHER COMPANIES IF THEY DO START TO LAY CABLES IN SOME PLACES WHICH PERHAPS THEY WILL BUT THEY CAN BE TINY
I DISAGREE I THINK THIS IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO DAVE YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES HE LOOK AT PORTUGAL YOU'VE GOT COMPANIES MANAGED TO COMPETE ACROSS FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE COUNTRY AND I THINK TODAY IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY WE'RE REUSING OPENREACH IS NETWORK WHICH REDUCES THE COST FOR OTHERS
LAY IN THEIR FIBRE FIBRE IS THE FUTURE IF THE U.K. IS GOING TO BE UP THERE WITH THE JAPAN'S OF THIS WORLD WE'VE GOT SEVENTY PER CENT OF THEIR BUSINESSES RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS GET FIBRE VIED TO THEIR BUSINESS AND THEIR HOME IN THE U.K. THAT'S TWO PER CENT AND SAY TODAY I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY COMPANY WHO READS THE REPORT TO SAY THAT
HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME IN TO COMPETE LAY MY FIBRE AND PROVIDE REAL CHOICE LOWER PRICES AND COMPETITION FOR CONSUMERS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY CHARM I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'LL BE HEARING FROM A CRITIC OF B.T. AND THEIR RED CHIEF EXECUTIVE TEMPUS
THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN RESULTS HAVE JUST BEEN RELEASED BY R. S. A. INSURANCE ROYAL SUN ALLIANCE ONE OF THE U.K.'S BIGGEST INSURERS IT'S BEEN IN THE MIDST OF A PERIOD OF CHANGE BUT IT'S REPORTED OPERATING PROFITS UP DESPITE CLAIMS RELATING TO FLOODING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS STEPHEN HESTER WHO USED TO RUN ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND AND HE JOINS US FROM THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW DO YOU MANAGE THIS
WELL IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS OF VERY HARD WORK AFTER OUR SAY AND GOT INTO A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES AND WE HAVE A CLEAN UP THE STRATEGY OF THE COMPANY FOCUSES ON OUR STRONGEST BUSINESSES IN THE U.K. AND CANADA AND SCANDINAVIA
AND A COUPLE OF OTHER PLACES WE FIXED A BALANCE SHEET MAKING THE CAPITAL MUCH STRONGER REDUCING THE RISK AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD BOTH DO A BETTER JOB FOR CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE ON COSTS AND TO BE CLEVERER HAD TAKING INSURANCE RISK AND ALL OF THAT AS YOU SAY TODAY HAS PRODUCED
A VERY GOOD PIECE GOOD PIECE OF NEWS WHICH IS PROFITS UP DIVIDENDS UP AND A FORECAST FOR THE FUTURE A LOT MORE OPTIMISTIC WHICH I THINK WILL BE TAKEN BY ALL OF THOSE WHO RELY ON US AND LOOKING AHEAD TO THE FUTURE YOU HAVE COME OUT FOR THE REMAIN CAMP THE STATEMENT FROM THE COMPANY SAYING WE BELIEVE THE U.K. WILL BE STRONGER AS PART OF A REFORMED E.U. WHY
CLEARLY FROM A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW WE'RE COMMENTING REALLY ON ON ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS MATTERS NOT ON ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS TO DO WITH THE EUROPEAN DECISION IN THE CASE OF R. S. A. SOMETHING LIKE HALF OF THE VALUE OF A COMPANY RELIES ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OF COURSE WE REPRESENT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHICH IS ONE OF THE JEWELS IN THE BUSINESS CROWN OF THE U.K. AND RELIES VERY MUCH ON THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF INSURANCE INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE MANY OF OUR
COMPETITORS LIE IN MUCH OF A I'VE GOT A BUSINESS LIES SO WE THINK THAT THE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THE ABILITY TO TRADE THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SERVICES IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND TO OURSELVES BUT IF THERE WAS A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULDN'T WE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE REACH THE KINDS OF AGREEMENTS WHICH WOULD ALLOW ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET HE MIGHT BE A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY BUT WE WOULD GET BACK IN
WITH OUR PRODUCTS INTO EUROPE I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I DON'T THINK THAT EXIT WOULD BE A DISASTER BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT EXIT WOULD BE WORSE THAN STAYING IN AND THERE WOULD BE A PERIOD OF ECONOMIC TURMOIL INSURERS OF COURSE ALSO A STEWARDS OF THE NATION'S SAVINGS AND PENSIONS AND THE MARKET TURMOIL YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THAT IN WARNINGS FROM RATING AGENCIES AND THE EXCHANGE RATE
THIS WEEK WOULD BE DAMAGING TO THE WEALTH IN THE U.K. SO SAID THE RISK THERE IS ONCE YOU'RE READY OF COURSE WE WERE WE WOULD SURVIVE IN EITHER EVENT SO THAT THE RISK IS IN THE UNCERTAIN PERIOD IN BETWEEN US REACHING NEW TRADE DEALS IS THAT RIGHT UP AFTER THAT YOU THINK WELL PLAYED YOU SAID WILL SURVIVE WE THRIVE
I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE WOULD BE INITIAL ECONOMIC DAMAGE IN THE UNCERTAINTY PERIOD AFTER THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE U.K. COULD BE STRONG IN EITHER EVENT BUT IT'S VERY UNCLEAR WHY THE U.K. WOULD BE STRONGER OUT AND YOU CAN THINK OF MANY REASONS WHY IT MIGHT BE WEAKER AND SO FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT SETTING ASIDE ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHICH CIVIL SERVANTS ARE GOING TO BE THE BEST AND SOLVENTS IN AND SO ON FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT IT SEEMS AT THE RISKS
OUTWEIGH THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF EXCESS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND COME OUT AND ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE'LL BE BETTER OFF INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTLY THERE SOME DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR HIM TO DO SO
I THINK ON THE ONE HAND IT CLEARLY IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OF PEOPLE IN VERY IMPORTANT POLICY MAKING POSITIONS SUCH AS THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO PROVIDE INPUT ON THESE QUESTIONS ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO TRY NOT TO GET SUCKED TOO MUCH INTO A POLITICISATION OF THOSE THINGS NOW IN MY EXPERIENCE A GOVERNOR KEARNEY IS VERY VERY ABLE BUT TREADING THAT LINE I'M SURE HE'LL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE
STEPHEN HAS TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THIS MORNING SEEING IS THE FLYING SCOTSMAN'S OFFICIAL RETURN TO THE EAST COAST MAIN LINE AFTER A DECADE LONG FOUR POINT TWO MILLION POUND RESTORATION IT IS MAKING THE TRIP NOT BETWEEN LONDON AND SCOTLAND IS GOING TO GET AS FAR AS YORK TODAY IT'S ALREADY AT KING'S CROSS AT LEAST I THINK IT IS A REPORTER JAMES ALEXANDER IS THERE ANYWHERE WHAT'S HAPPENING JAMES

THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE CHANGE WE NEED IS TO VOTE TO GO THAT IS WHAT BORIS JOHNSON SAID ONE ANNOUNCING HIS DECISION TO BACK THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN
HE MIGHT HAVE DENMARK IN MIND A REFERENDUM THERE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO REJECTED THE MAASTRICHT TREATY IT WAS APPROVED IN A SECOND REFERENDUM A YEAR LATER AFTER OPT OUTS WERE AGREED ONE OF THE DANISH MINISTERS INVOLVED WAS ANDERS FOR RASMUSSEN WHO WENT ON TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER OF DENMARK AND LATER SECRETARY GENERAL OF NATO I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF NEGOTIATING YOU TERMS FOR THE DANISH PEOPLE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES
THEY VOTED NO IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WE THEN NEGOTIATED TO A NUMBER OF SO CALLED OPT OUTS WE'VE GOT FOUR OF THEM AND THE YEAR AFTER PEOPLE VOTED YES VILLAIN WITH A VERY BROAD MAJORITY IT IS AN EXAMPLE THAT IS BEING FLOATED HERE IN TERMS OF A VOTE TO LEAVE BEING A WAY TO GET CHANGE OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BORIS JOHNSON THE MAYOR OF LONDON HAS SAID
ALL E.U. HISTORY SHOWS THEY ONLY LISTEN TO A POPULATION WHEN THEY SAY NO IS HE RIGHT NO THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE WHAT'S TRUE FOR DENMARK WELL YES WE WE HAD A VERY PARTICULAR SITUATION BECAUSE THE DANISH AIR PEOPLE REJECTED
THE MAASTRICHT TREATY AND IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARDS WE HAD TO FIND AN ARRANGEMENT ACCORDING TO WHICH DENMARK COULD GET ITS SPARE SHARE A PROUD WITH OUT HAVING TO CHANGE THE WHOLE TREATY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE BUT IN THE LEAD UP TO THAT SITUATION AND I WAS PART OF MY IT MYSELF WE NEGOTIATED THE MAASTRICHT TREATY END OF COURSE
PUSHES TUNES FROM ALL COUNTRIES WERE INCLUDED BUT HER VOTE TO LEAVE COULD BE A WAY OF BRITAIN GETTING MORE FROM THE OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES THEN DAVID CAMERON MANAGED TO GET AT HIS NEGOTIATIONS IN BRUSSELS
I DON'T THINK SO I THINK THIS IS MAKE OR BREAK I MEAN CAMERON GOT A LOT IN THERE IN BRUSSELS I THINK HE GOT THE MAYOR KSHIN ONE OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE IF YOU STILL HAVE TO FIND AN AGREEMENT AMONG ALL CONTRAS IF THE BRITISH PEOPLE REJECT THAT I'M SURE THAT BRITAIN WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE
IS WHAT HE GOT LEGALLY BINDING IN THE ABSENCE OF TREATY CHANGE IS IT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED AT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IT IS LEGALLY BINDING AND AGAIN I WOULD USE THE PAIN KNEW SEEKS HIM BRUTALLY LESTRADE DID THE DANISH ARE PROUD TO WORK HER LEGALLY
BASED ON EXACTLY THE SAME FOUNDATION AS THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN UNION AND KEN TESTIFIED TO THE FACT ALSO AS FORMER PRIME MINSTER OF DENMARK THAT IT IS INDEED VERY BINDING AND WE HAVE FOUND OUR SELF
BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT NOW FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AND A SHOAL HAS THE EUROPEAN UNION OUR SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT HAS NEVER EVER BEEN QUESTIONED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION IT IS LEGALLY BINDING AND TODAY IN THE DEBATE IN BRITAIN SECURITY IS ALSO COMING INTO THINGS WE HAVE THIRTEEN FORMER DEFENCE CHIEFS AS SAYING THAT BRITAIN SHOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE E.U. BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY THAT WE WILL COLLABORATE BEST WITH OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES
AS A FORMER SECRETARY GENERAL OF NATO ISN'T IT THE CASE THAT THAT COLLABORATION WOULD CONTINUE BRITAIN WOULD REMAIN A MEMBER OF NATO IT WOULD REMAIN CLOSELY COLLABORATING WITH ITS ALLIES WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THIS REFERENDUM YEAH OF COURSE YOU CAN'T KEEP THE U.K. AL GOLF MADE SHOW BUT DID WOULD BE WE CAN EAT UNITED KINGDOM
WITHIN NATO BECAUSE IN NATAL WE NEED A STRONG VOICE OF THE U.K. NOT LEAST BECAUSE WE NEED ESCROW ON TRENT HAD PLENTY CAN LINK AND THEY O.K. HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY STRONG PROPONENT
OF THAT LINK IF YOU WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE VOICE OF U.K. WOULD BE WEAK IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE E.U. YOU'LL ALL SHOW SPEAK WITH THEM MORE HEAVY WEIGHT WHEN YOU ARE SPEAKING ABOUT THE TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP
BUT IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE Y. U. THAT ARKLE MEANT WOULD DIMINISH IN IMPORTANCE AS A EUROPEAN POLITICIAN VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRYING TO ATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP I WOULD CHANGE QUANTO LI REGRET IF REAGAN WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ADD LOT IS AT STAKE WHEN IT COMES TO SECURITY

THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IN FOUR MONTHS' TIME WE WILL KNOW WHETHER IT WAS THE LEAVE ALL THE REMAIN COUNTS THAT WON THE DAY IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM AHEAD OF THE VOTE ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD WE WILL BE HEARING FROM PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY PARTICULARLY THOSE WHOSE DAY STARTS EARLY WHILE WE'RE ON THE AIR THIS MORNING NICK IS OUT AND ABOUT JUST OUTSIDE SWINDON IN FACT MORNING
GOOD MORNING TO YOU YES WE'VE BEEN AT A DAIRY FARM AND NOW WE ARE AND HE FRANKLY IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE SCARY GOOD BUT NOW IN AN EXERCISE CLASS WERE TWENTY PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ARE KNOCKING SEVEN BELLS OUT OF EACH OTHER FOR THEIR EXERCISE BEFORE THEY GO OFF TO TO WORK AND WE'RE HERE TO TALK TO SHONA WHAT WHO OWNS THE BUSINESS THAT RUNS US EXCISE AND SHAUN EDWARDS WAS A LEG
G. P. AS WELL TO GET A SENSE OF HOW THE E.U. AFFECTS THEIR LIVES AND WHAT IT IS THAT MIGHT HELP THEM MAKE UP THEIR MIND SHONA FIRST OF ALL SMALL BUSINESS OWNER LIKE YOU HE REALLY FRANKLY MUCH AFFECTED BY IT
TO BE HONEST NICK THEIR IMPACT ON A SMALL BUSINESS LIKE ARTS WERE U.K. FOCUS WE DON'T WE HAVE A EUROPEAN DIMENSION IT'S GOING TO BE MINIMAL
I MEAN THERE'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF CURRENCY RACE THAT WE HAVE IN SOME OF OUR COST BASE BUT OTHER THAN THAT THE PRIMARY IMPACT WOULD PROBABLY BE IF THERE WAS A GENERAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY WHICH AFFECTED PEOPLE'S DISPOSABLE INCOME TO SPEND ON
DISCRETION ACTIVITIES SUCH AS LEISURE CLASSES LIKE THIS CRUDELY YOUR CONCERN IS WHETHER THE WOMEN WHO COME TO THIS CLASS WILL STILL HAVE THE MONEY TO DO SO IF WE WERE TO LIVE ABSOLUTELY THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A PRIMARY CONCERN AS A SMALL BUSINESS HERE IS SHOWN AS A G.P. A DID THAT IN WHAT WAY DIRECTLY DOES THE E.U. MEMBERSHIP
HE DOESN'T REALLY DIRECTLY AFFECT ME AS HER G.P. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE ARE CONTROL VERY MUCH MORE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH I SUPPOSE ULTIMATELY FINANCIALLY
WE ARE AFFECTED BUT THERE'S A BIG ISSUE MIGRATION THAT'S ON MANY PEOPLE'S LET'S DANCE
YES POTENTIALLY WHERE I AM IN SWINDON I WOULDN'T SAY IT HAS A HUGE EFFECT BUT I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK HIM
IN A CITY PRACTICES AND I SUSPECT IT PROBABLY DOES HAVE MORE ANYTHING OF AN EFFECT ON THE CONCERNED TO YOU BECAUSE OF THE G.P.S IN SWINDON IT'S A PLACE THAT IS ON THE PRESSURE YOU'RE UNDER DOCTOR YEAH ABSOLUTELY WE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER ADOPTED WE HAVE A
PROBLEMS RECRUITING G.P.S NOT ONLY HERE BUT I THINK THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS AND OBVIOUSLY IF THE POPULATION IS INCREASING WE FIND IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO COPE
WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT MY SURGERY THEY ARE PRACTISING IN A VERY SMALL BUILDING THAT IS TOO SMALL FOR THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS
GOODNESS ONLY KNOWS HOW WE'RE GOING TO COPE IF WE HAVE AN INFLUX OF POPULATION THE IMMIGRANTS OR ANYBODY ELSE TO HAVE SOMEBODY SAID LEAVING WOULD HAVE FEWER PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WITH THAT CHIMPS YOU
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD ACTUALLY BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES
I HAVE MORE OF AN EFFECT IT IS
HOW ABOUT YOU SHARE IS THAT ISSUE THE ISSUE OF MIGRATION ONE THAT'S HIGH ON YOUR LIST OR AS THE ECONOMY THE KEY DITTA
THE ECONOMY REALLY IS THE MAIN PRIORITY AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED THIS IS A TOWN WHICH MAKES A LOT OF MONEY FOR MANUFACTURING HAS A LOT OF B.
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU KEEP YOUR ANSWER THAT'S RIGHT THE OTHER ONE SWINDON STRENGTHS IS THEIR DIVERSITY OF THE ECONOMY THERE'S LOTS OF THERE'S A STRONG FINANCIAL SECTOR IN THE STRONG MANUFACTURING SECTOR HERE AS WELL
WE HAVE HAD A MAJOR ENERGY COMPANY IN THE TIMES
SO REALLY YEAH BUT THE IMPACT OF INDIRECT IMPACT ON ARSE WILL BE ON THE PHONE THIS ISSUE FOR EXIT MAY AFFECT A LOT OF THOSE KEY EMPLOYER IN IN THE TIME AND IN A WORD YOU'RE INCLINED TO VOTE
FIRST ME I THINK I HAVE ALREADY MADE MY MIND UP I'M AND NATURAL PRO EUROPEAN AS A AS A SCOTSMAN
YES I DO PRO EUROPEAN I'D BE VOTING TO STAY EMPTY TWO PROS HERE WE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THE DAIRY FARM EARLIER
JUST IN A MICHELLE WE'RE GOING TO BE HEADING OFF FOR A NICE FRY UP LATER WHERE WE MAY HEAR ANOTHER VARIETY OF VIEWS AND NOW I'M GOING TO GET THE SEVEN BELLS KNOCKED OUT OF ME BY TWENTY WOMEN WITH BOXING GLOVES
THANKS OR OUCH TIME FOURTEEN MINUTES TAKE TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN A CARDIFF STUDIO THIS MORNING I CAN DADDY DOES WHO'S VERSION OF HINDU TEACHER AND THEOLOGIAN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING JUSTIN TO DAMAGE TO DELHI'S MONARCH CANAL AT THE WEEKEND HAS LEFT MILLIONS OF ITS RESIDENTS WITHOUT WATER TWELVE PEOPLE ARE DEAD THE ARMY'S BEEN CALLED IN AND THE FORECAST IS THAT WILL TAKE TWO WEEKS TO RESTORE THE SUPPLY
THE SABOTAGE WAS CARRIED OUT BY MEMBERS OF THE JET COMMUNITY WHO ODDLY FOR A OFF OFF SOCIAL GROUP ON SOME OF THE JOBS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS RESERVED FOR THE AWKWARDLY TITLED OTHER BACKWARD CLASSES THERE SEEMS ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF INDIA'S ANCIENT AND TROUBLESOME CASTE SYSTEM BUT THE SITUATION IS THOROUGHLY MODERN
THE EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN INDIA HAS PRODUCED MILLIONS OF YOUNG PERSONS DESPERATE FOR EMPLOYMENT THAT MATCHES THEIR SKILLS AND DESPITE A GROWING ECONOMY INDIA CANNOT HOPE TO GENERATE THE TWENTY THREE MILLION NEW JOBS HAD NEEDS EVERY YEAR
CAST AS COMPLEX IT'S ACTUALLY A BRITISH TERM THE CONFLICTS TO ORIGINAL CONCEPT JUT AND VARNA VARNA IS DEFINED IN THE BOG OF A GITA AS THE DUTIES ASSOCIATED WITH ONE'S PROFESSION IT'S NOT FIXED BY BIRTH BUT DETERMINED BY A PERSON'S CHARACTER SKILLS AND APPLICATION
JUDD HOWEVER CHARACTERISE AS ONE'S FAMILY AND COMMUNITY BY BIRTH AND IN A STATIC AGRARIAN ECONOMY IT'S NATURAL THAT ONE'S JOB AND FAMILY IDENTITY MARRIAGE LIKE MANY BRITISH SURNAME'S SMITH TAYLOR AND COOK
UNFORTUNATELY OVER THE CENTURIES UNSCRUPULOUS BRAHMAN PRIESTS CLAIMED THAT THEY WERE AT THE PINNACLE OF A RIGID SOCIAL HIERARCHY BUT THAT'S A DREADFUL CORRUPTION OF THE ORIGINAL HINDI TEXAN WHICH THE VARIOUS VINERS ARE INTENDED TO WORK COOPERATIVELY THEY DESCRIBED LIKE THE HEAD ARMS LEGS AND ORGANS OF THE BODY
EACH HAS A DIFFERENT BUT ESSENTIAL ROLE AND EACH RECEIVES A SAME SUSTENANCE AND NOURISHMENT FROM THE FOOD AND OUR STOMACH AND THE BLOOD FROM HER HEART IF ONE PART OF THE BODY IS A NEED OR TROUBLE THE OTHERS REACT TO HELP
IT'S HUMAN TENDENCY TO SHRINK AND TO OUR OWN PROTECTED BUBBLE A FAMILY COMMUNITY PROFESSION OR NATION AND TO CAMPAIGN FOR WHAT WE SEE AS FAIR TREATMENT FOR A GROUP BUT ONE PERSON'S FAIR TREATMENT IS ANOTHER SPECIAL PRIVILEGE
FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN INDIA THE MYSTIC PHILOSOPHER AND SOCIAL REFORMER SRI CHE TANYA LET A CHALLENGE TO THE INJUSTICES OF THE CASTE SYSTEM HE FAMOUSLY CLAIMED I'M NOT A BRAHMAN OR A WARRIOR A POLITICIAN NOR A MERCHANT OF FARMER NOR ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL CAST SO WHO AM I
I AM SIMPLY THE SERVANT OF THE SERVANT OF THE SERVANT OF THE SUPREME
I HAVE A FAMILY OR COMMUNITY OR COUNTRY AND THESE DEFINED MY RESPONSIBILITIES MY EXTERNAL LIFE BUT ACCORDING TO CHEAT TANYA KNOWING WHO I AM AS THE SERVANT OF ALL GOD'S CHILDREN DEFINES HOW I MAY BEST FULFIL ALL THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES COOPERATIVELY AND FAIRLY
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH I CAN DADDY DUST THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHAT ON EARTH WITH THE PLACE AND THE LOCAL COUNCIL AND RATHER UM THINKING WHEN UNDER THEIR EYES SOME OF THE CRUELLEST MOST DISGUSTING TREATMENT OF CHILDREN THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE WAS CARRYING ON IN SOMETHING LIKE PLAIN SIGHT HAVE THE POLICE HAVE OTHER AUTHORITIES CHANGE THEIR VIEW IN THE YEARS SINCE THE EARLY PART OF THE CENTURY WHEN THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE FIRST MADE
YESTERDAY WE SAW ACROSS THE CONVICTION OF THREE BROTHERS AND THEIR UNCLE HE'D BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ABUSE OF FIFTEEN VICTIMS THEY WERE OF COURSE PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS AND MANY MANY MORE VICTIMS AND THERE IS A POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION INQUIRY INTO THE BEHAVIOUR INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS ACCORDING TO MOHAMMED SHAFIQ AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE RAMADAN FOUNDATION OF MUSLIM YOUTH ORGANISATION YOU CAN'T GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS WITHOUT ADDRESSING RACE AND CULTURE
THESE SORT OF MEN HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE I'M IN MANY CASES A RACIST ATTITUDE TOWARDS WHITE YOUNG GIRLS THEY VIEW THEM AS WORTHLESS THEY VIEWED HIM AS COMMODITIES THAT CAN BE TRADED ON THAT THEY CAN BE ABUSED IN THIS OP HRANT'S OFF WAY FOR TOO LONG AS A SOCIETY AS THE PAKISTANI COMMUNITY WE'VE TURNED A BLIND EYE TO THESE SORT OF CRIMES
AND YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE COLD CASES WE HAVE PEOPLE BEEN CONVICTED THERE IS STILL A SMALL MINORITY OF PEOPLE WITHIN MY COMMUNITY WHO REFUSED TO ACCEPT THAT THIS SORT OF THING GOES ON
I WAS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THE DOCTOR ANGIE HEEL WAS COMMISSIONED BY SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE TO WRITE A REPORT INTO DRUG ABUSE AND RATHER AND WHICH HE FOUND EVIDENCE OF CHILD ABUSE SHE'S ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THEN DO YOU THINK MANAGED SHAFIQ IS RIGHT
I THINK DEFINITELY THERE ARE ISSUES OF RACE HERE WITH A SMALL ELEMENT OF PEOPLE FROM THE PAKISTANI COMMUNITIES BUT IT'S A MUCH WIDER ISSUE THAN JUST THAT BUT
THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY WE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING IN DETAIL AT ISSUE BUT MIGHT THAT BE PART OF WHY THE POLICE FELT UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO USE WHAT SHE HAD TOLD THEM AND PROSECUTE PEOPLE
I THINK THAT WAS ONE ELEMENT OF IT I THINK THEY WERE FOR MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES I THINK IT WAS TO DO WITH HOW THEY VIEWED THE YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE INVOLVED AND THEY SAW THEM AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN ABUSE I THINK THERE WERE OTHER ISSUES AS WELL ABOUT PROTECTING THE REPUTATION OF THE TOWN
AND PROTECTING IN IN THE SAME SITUATION IN THEM THEIR OWN REPUTATIONS AND WE CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED MOTHER AND AS A RESULT OF YOU KNOW NOT HAPPY NOT PROTECTING IT WAS SO LONG AGO TWO THOUSAND THREE WASN'T IT YOU FIRST
WERE ASKED TO LOOK INTO THINGS AND I THINK YOU DID ANOTHER REPORT TO THREE YEARS LATER AS I RIGHT I DID BUT I ACTUALLY TOOK MY FIRST REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND TO WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT CRACK CAME MARKETS IN SOUTH YORKSHIRE AND THAT'S WHEN I FIRST CAME ACROSS ISSUE OF WHAT WE CALL CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION WERE YOU TEMPTED BECAUSE YOUR REPORT WASN'T MADE PUBLIC AND FURTHER THAN A NEWSPAPER THE CHEF WILL START EVENTUALLY MANAGED TO GET IT MADE PUBLIC BUT ONLY QUITE RECENTLY TEMPTED EVER TO WHAT DID YOU FEEL THAT YOU SHOULD PERHAPS IN RETROSPECT HAVE HAVE LEAKED IT
WELL MY REPORTS WENT QUITE FAR AND RIDE BECAUSE I WASN'T I WAS EMPLOYED BY SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE BY WAS ACTUALLY CONTRACTED TO WORK FOR THE PARTNER AGENCIES THE DRUG ACTION TEAMS SO I WAS MY REPORTS WERE GOING QUITE WIDE IN FACT MY TWO THOUSAND SIX REPORT I HAVE SEEN CIRCULATION LIST FROM THE I.P.C.C. AND THERE MUST BE ONE HUNDRED NAMES ON THAT LIST NOT ALL THE POLICE OFFICERS
SOME WERE REPEATED NAMES BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I WAS CIRCULATING INFORMATION TO BOTH WITHIN THE PLACE AND EXTERNALLY AND WHEN THEY DID NOTHING THEY WERE WERE YOU NOT TEMPTED JUST TO GO PUBLIC
WELL I KNOW I DID HAVE SOME REMEMBERS SOME OF THE LOCAL PRESS WERE INVOLVED THERE HAVE BEEN ARTICLES IN RADIO FIVE IN THE LOCAL PRESS ABOUT THIS IT WASN'T JUST ME THAT WAS SAYING THIS INFORMATION IT WAS QUITE WELL KNOWN
IT'S JUST LACK OF ACTION DO YOU ARE YOU CONVINCED FROM WHERE YOU ARE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE OF THIS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME ARE YOU CONVINCED THAT THINGS HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED NOW I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THE SAME WAY THAT I WAS THEN SO SOME OF THE INFORMATION I HAVE IS ANECDOTAL
OF COURSE LOTS OF RESOURCES AND STAFF HAVE BEEN PUTTING INTO TO WORK WITH VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS AND TRY AND GET SOME PROSECUTIONS AS WE SAW YESTERDAY I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING KES AND COMPLETELY FINE
I THINK CHANGE IN THIS WAY ORGANISATIONAL CHANGE IN CULTURAL CHANGE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME ALL RIGHT A DOCTOR A GILL THANK YOU LET'S TURN TO CHIEF CONSTABLE SIMON BAILEY IS THE NATIONAL POLICE CHIEFS COUNCILS LEAD FOR CHILD ABUSE INVESTIGATION GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DO YOU THINK THINGS HAVE CHANGED FUNDAMENTALLY YES I THINK THINGS HAVE AN UNEQUIVOCALLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED IF YOU LOOK AT THE VICTIM CONFIDENCE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE UP TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN
WE HAVE SEEN AN EIGHTY PERCENT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REPORTS THAT WE ARE SEEING SO VICTIMS HAVE GREATER CONFIDENCE THE POLICE SERVICES APPROACH TO DEALING WITH ALLEGATIONS OF THIS TYPE HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THE COLLEGE OF POLICING IS IS SENDING OUT SOME VERY CLEAR GUIDANCE AND TRAINING TO TO FRONT LINE STAFF TO ALL NEW RECRUITS TO DETECTIVE OFFICERS WE HAVE A C. A C. COORDINATORS AND ANALYSTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
AND WE ARE DEALING WITH A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM BUT WE ARE DEALING WITH IT AND YES WE HAVE THIS WEIRD CONFUSION WITH SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SAYING POLICE OFFICERS ARE CONFUSED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BELIEVE COMPLAINANTS AUTOMATICALLY AND THEN THE HEAD OF THE PLACE WATCHDOG WRITING TO HIM TO SAY THAT HE'D GOT IT WRONG A MINUTE DO WHAT WHAT ARE THE RULES AS YOU UNDERSTAND THEM IF A COMPLAINT IS
AT WHAT STAGE IS THAT COMPLAINT SIMPLY BELIEVED AND AT WHAT STAGE IS EVIDENCE FOLLOWED WELL LET LET ME LET'S ALMOST TAKE THIS THIS BACK TOO AND LET'S LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE EYES OF THE VICTIM A VICTIM COMING FORWARD TO HAVING THE COURAGE AND CONFIDENCE TO REPORT ABUSE HAS TAKEN A REALLY SIGNIFICANT STEP
AND I WAS ONLY TALKING TO TO A VICTIM EARLY THIS WEEK AND THEY SAID TO ME SIMON THE MOST THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU TAKE THE REPORT AND YOU TAKE THE ALLEGATION THAT I AM MAKING SERIOUSLY AND POLICE OFFICERS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY
FRONT LINE STAFF A SPECIALIST OFFICERS ARE DOING THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY AND I BELIEVE THE THAT HE'S BEEN PROVEN IN TERMS OF CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE NOW SEEING HER VICTIMS ARE COMING FORWARD OR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE SAYS THAT THE POLICE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AS THEY TEST THE CLAIMS IS THAT RIGHT AND AND EVERY POLICE OFFICER IS LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE THEY ARE PURSUING THE EVIDENCE AS IT IS SEEN WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOUR AND I AND AS A DETECTIVE OF TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE YEARS
I HAVE ALWAYS GONE WHERE THE EVIDENCE HAS TAKEN ME THE EVIDENCE THAT PROVES ORTIS PROOPS VICTIMS WANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A POLICE SERVICE IS DEMONSTRATE I SUPPOSE WHAT A GREAT EFFECT YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE THERE IS IS AT WHAT STAGE THEY'RE SIMPLY BELIEVED AMERICA YOU GO AND REPORT YOU YOUR CAR'S MISSING OR SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY THE POLICE BELIEVE THAT YOUR CAR IS MISSING AND THEN THEY GO ON TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE IS IT IS IT THE SAME WITH THESE KIND OF REPORTS THAT THE INITIAL
THE INITIAL POSITION MUST BE YES THIS IS RIGHT THIS IS A CORRECT COMPLAINT AND THEN IT GOES WHERE THE EVIDENCE GET WELL WE WOULD ALWAYS GO WHERE THE EVIDENCE GOES BUT THE CUP THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT VICTIMS HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO COME FORWARD
AND AT THEIR ALLEGATIONS TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND I WOULD TAKE YOU BACK TO THE TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE BELIEVED INITIALLY BUT BUT TAKEN TAKEN TO THE POINT WHERE BY THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TAKEN SERIOUSLY ON THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS IF WE LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE LOOK AT WHAT THE ENNIS P. C. C.'S REVIEW INTO HOW SEVERAL HAPPENED THEY INTERVIEWED OVER TWENTY VICTIMS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING COMING OUT OF THAT WAS THE VICTIMS HAD DISCLOSED TO FAMILY TO FRIENDS
HADN'T BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY YES AND THAT'S A MARROW WILL BE THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING SIMON BAILEY CHIEF CONSTABLE SIMON THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT CHRIS FOXES HERE WITH THE WEATHER THAT'S ON THE SHOW US ANOTHER VERY COLD START TO THE DAY TEMPERATURES LAST NIGHT TO GO DOWN TO MINUS SEVEN STARTING OFF THERE WITH A BIT OF CLOUD AFFECTING SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND EAST ANGLIA HAS GIVEN A FEW FLAKES OF SNOW THIS MORNING BUT WILL QUICKLY MOVE AWAY

BUILD THEIR OWN FIBRE NETWORK SO SO IT'S NOT AS IF THEY'VE THEY'VE STOPPED SHORT OF DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE SUGGESTING AS THE OPTION ADDICT STOP SHORT OF DOING ANYTHING IN TERMS OF STRUCTURALLY SEPARATING OPENREACH I AGREE ACCESS TO FIREBIRD DOCKS AND POLES WERE VERY GOOD AT THE MOMENT IT IS BOTH SIMPLER AND CHEAPER TO PUT UP YOUR OWN TELEGRAPH POLE NEXT TO A B.T. ONE WHICH IS JUST NONSENSE
SO IT IS GOOD THAT THAT OFCOM IS ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE ISSUES BUT THE BIGGEST WORRY I'VE GOT IS ACTUALLY THAT AS YOU'VE JUST SAID WE'RE ALL STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS AND THE DANGER IS FROM THIS REPORT THIS MORNING THAT OFCOM WILL ENCOURAGE US ALL TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME BY AND WE NEED TO WE NEED TO FIX THE ISSUES IN THE INDUSTRY NOT JUST TALK ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE IS THE DELIVERY OF THE SERVICE ISN'T IT RATHER THAN NECESSARILY THAT THE CORPORATE STRUCTURE OF OPENREACH
ARE YOU GOING TO BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE ABBEY AT THE AVENUE THAT OFCOM HAS OPENED TODAY IN IN ALLOWING OTHERS TO TO GET A SLICE OF OF OPENREACH IS BUSINESS WHAT WE OWE ONE OF OPENREACH ARE SINGLE LARGEST CUSTOMERS
AND IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC TO MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD OUR OWN FAB TO THE PREMISE NETWORK WE'RE ALREADY TRIALLING THE TECHNOLOGY WITH WE'VE GOT LIVE PAYING CUSTOMERS IN YORK ON OUR OWN FIBRE FIBRE NETWORK AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EASY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO OPEN RITUAL ISN'T EXACTLY ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT OFCOM JESTING AND I WANTED TO SEE I HOPE SO MY WORRY IS THAT WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS A VERY LONG DOCUMENT THAT TALKS ABOUT CONSULTING AND REVIEWING RATHER THAN DOING
AND WE'VE HAD TEN YEARS OF THAT AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM WHAT WE NEED TO GET ON IN SEARCH OF SOME ACTION COS MY CUSTOMERS WANT TO SEE A BETTER SERVICE TODAY TOMORROW NOT IN TEN YEARS' TIME ARE YOU SUGGESTING THE WHAT OFCOM HAS SAID DOESN'T GIVE YOU ENOUGH ASSURANCE THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO CHANGE THE OPENREACH I ABSOLUTELY I'M SUGGESTING THAT BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE US ENOUGH ASSURANCE BECAUSE WHAT A OFCOM IS SUGGESTING IS THAT B.T. HAS A REAL AND IDENTIFIED REZA
TO FAVOUR IT'S OWN BUSINESS WHILE IT OWNS OPENREACH AND JETS OFCOM ARE NOT MOVING TO THE OBVIOUS STRUCTURAL SOLUTION WHICH IS TO SEPARATE OUT OPENREACH COMPLETELY O.K. AND ON YOUR OWN PROGRAMME AN HOUR OR SO AGO THEY WEREN'T WILLING TO SAY WHAT IT WAS THAT OPEN HAD TO DO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE SEPARATED AND THAT'S A LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY THAT ACTUALLY I THINK IS BAD FOR EVERYBODY IN THE INDUSTRY THEY THEY ARE STATED VERY CLEARLY THAT OPENREACH HAS AN OBLIGATION TO TREAT ALL ITS CUSTOMERS
EQUALLY NOW IN TERMS OF BROADBAND SERVICE I MEAN B.T.'S COMPLAINED ABOUT THAT YOUR SERVICES COMPLAINED ABOUT A LOT I MEAN NOT JUST THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE BUT YOU'RE YOUR EMPLOYEES NOT CALLING PEOPLE BACK SO IT'S NOT AS IF B.T. HAVE A MONOPOLY ON THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS SIDE OF THINGS OH I'D COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT I THINK THE WHOLE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO IMPROVE I'D BE THE FIRST PERSON TO ADMIT THAT TALK TALK HAS GOT LOTS OF WORK TO DO IF YOU LOOK OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS
OUR COMPLAINTS HAVE GONE DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS COMPLAINED ABOUT THAN B.T. AREN'T BUT I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT THAT IS ENOUGH WE'VE ALL GOT TO DO MORE BUT WE NEED OFCOM TO BE TOUGH AND DETERMINED TO ACT RATHER THAN JUST TALK AND YOU'VE BEEN CALLING FOR A B.T. TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO INTO OPENREACH SHIFT
IF YOU HAD THE CERTAINTY YOU NEEDED TO TAKE THE STEPS THAT YOU SAY YOU YOU WOODY ARE YOU CONVINCED THAT BUT THAT SORT OF INVESTMENT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO FINANCING WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU I'VE BEEN CALLING FOR OPEN REACHED BECOME A COMPLETELY SEPARATE COMPANY FROM B.T. SO THAT B.T. ISN'T THE ONE MAKING THE DECISIONS ON WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS MORE MONEY IN OPENREACH OR NOT AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK WHAT THEY SHOULD BE SEPARATE I THINK IT'S DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS THAT WE WERE HEARING ONLY YESTERDAY THAT MAGICALLY SOME MORE MONEY WAS AVAILABLE FOR UP TO OPENREACH FROM B.T. IT CANNOT HAVE BEEN A COINCIDENCE
THAT IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS REPORT THIS MORNING INDEPENDENCE WILL MEAN OPEN RICH MAKES THE RIGHT DECISIONS FOR THE CUSTOMERS RATHER THAN THE DECISIONS THAT ARE RIGHT FOR B.T. GROUP DIED A HARDING THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S TURN THEN TO GAVIN PATERSON THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF B.T. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THAT IS TRUE ISN'T IT THAT MAGICALLY
YOU HAVE RAISED THE PROSPECT VERY RECENTLY OF MORE MONEY ANOTHER BILLION POUNDS BEING AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN OPENREACH IT'S TRUE WE GAVE AN UPDATE ON SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS BACK IN SEPTEMBER WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE WE WERE DOING TRIALS ON THE NEXT GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGY ULTRA FAST
AND WHAT WE UPDATED ON THIS WEEK WAS THAT THOSE TRANCE HAVE GONE VERY WELL AND WE'RE READY TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT INVESTMENT OF OVER A BILLION POUNDS TO TAKE US FORWARD TO THE NEXT STEP OF TECHNOLOGY AND GETS TO AN ULTRA FASCINATION WITH THE TIME TINY CAN'T BE ANY COINCIDENCE THE FACT IS YOU HAVE HAD BEEP THE SPECTRE OF A POTENTIAL BREAK UP OF THE COMPANY HANGING OVER YOU THIS IS WHAT ON COMM OFCOM HAVE SAID IN THE INTERIM REPORT SO THAT IT'S YOUR WAY ISN'T IT OF OF WARDING OFF HER POTENTIAL BREAK UP I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT THAT WAY I MEAN IT'S IT'S A COINCIDENCE IT'S THIS WEEK
ULTIMATELY WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY I THINK DIED HE'S MADE A VERY GOOD POINT WE DON'T WANT THIS TO DRAG ON FOR A LONG TIME THE UNCERTAINTY IS NOT NOT JUST BAD FOR THE COMPANY IT'S BAD FOR THE COUNTRY'S A HOLE WE ARE READY TO INVEST BUT WE DO NEED THE LIST THE CERTAINTY THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN GET A RETURN FOR THAT WHY WHY WOULD YOU NOT TO GET AT GET A GET A RETURN FOR IT BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IF IF
OFCOM WITH THINKING OF SEPARATING OPENREACH OUT OF B.T. THAT WOULD BE A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING SO YOU'RE NOT WILLING ARE NOT WILLING TO DO ANYTHING IN THE INTERIM THERE I'M NOT SAYING THAT AT ALL I'M LOOKING FOR SOME MORE CONFIDENCE OVER REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITH WHICH WE CAN GET A RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT THE SUMS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE HUGE THE PAYBACK PERIODS RUN TO TEN TO TWENTY YEARS
WE CAN'T EXPECT OUR SHAREHOLDERS TO INVEST WITHOUT ANY CERTAINTY OR CONFIDENCE THEY'RE GOING AT THE MONEY BUY IT O.K. SO SIMILARLY THEY ENTERED TO DIDO HARDING FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ODD BUT YOU HAVE THE SAME CONCERN THAT OFCOM THAT THAT WHAT OFCOM HAS SAID TODAY IS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH FOR YOU TO TAKE ANY ACTION AT ALL WHAT WE'VE BEEN PROPOSING IS WE'RE READY TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT TO THE THE CURRENT UNDERTAKINGS VOLUNTARY
AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH OFCOM TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS WHERE WHERE WHERE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING BETTER WE'RE UP TO MAKING THOSE CHANGES WHERE ARE YOU READY TO MAKE THOSE THOSE THOSE EILEEN'S GOING TO ARE YOU GOING TO RESPOND TO OFCOM'S CALL THAT IT WHICH IT SAYS YOU MUST OPEN UP YOUR NETWORK OF TELEGRAPH POLES AND UNDERGROUND TUNNELS TO ALLOW RIVALS TO BUILD THEIR OWN NETWORKS ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT
IT'S AVAILABLE TODAY IT'S BEEN AVAILABLE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IF THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN IMPROVE IT OF COURSE WE WILL LOOK AT THAT IF WE IF THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THE PRICING IS WRONG WE WERE LOOK AT THAT AS WELL BUT IT'S BEEN AVAILABLE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND INTERESTINGLY VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN IT UP FACTOR OF OFCOM COMMAS WRONG THEN TIP TO MAKE THIS CALL IF YOU SAY THAT THERE'S NOTHING SAYING THERE'S NOTHING THERE WE MADE A VOLUNTARY COMMITMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
WE NEED TO GO THROUGH THE REPORT TO SEE WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVEMENT IN THE WAY IT'S OPERATING TODAY BUT WE'RE READY TO MAKE THE CHANGES IF IF THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO BACK AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SERVICE THAT CUSTOMERS RECEIVE AND CUSTOMERS IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PARTS THE COUNTRY OTHER THAN HIS AS WELL AS A RURAL AND HAVE A LISTEN TO THIS IS WHAT OUR REPORTERS ONLY CONWAY LEARNT WHEN SHE SPOKE TO TWO PEOPLE WHO RUN THEIR BUSINESSES FROM HOME WHO RELY ON B.T. OPENREACH FOR THEIR BROADBAND
MY NAME IS JOHN AND I NOW MAKE MUSIC VIDEOS OR YOUNG MUSICIAN GRAM MUSIC STUDENTS AND YOU LIVE IN SHEPHERD'S BUSH WHICH IS IN LONDON THAT'S GREAT IF YOU WERE TO TRY AND UPLOAD ONE OF THEIR VIDEOS HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE FOR EXAMPLE
MANY VIDEO PROBABLY
WHAT DO YOU MAKE A WELL I'M DISAPPOINTED PARTICULARLY WHEN IN PLACES LIKE JAPAN
HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND BROADBAND FOR
MY NAME'S FEELING KOWALSKI AND I LIVE IN MULL
AND WHAT'S YOUR BROADBAND LIKE IT'S INCREDIBLE
WE CAN DOWNLOAD A MOVE BUT IT CAN FLOAT AROUND AN HOUR AN HOUR AND A HEART WHAT A T. SAYING TO YOU
INVESTIGATING OPTIONS PICK IT UP AND THE CAPE IN A RURAL AREA RIGHT IT IS LITERALLY A RESIDENTIAL IF THEY
SO THAT DOESN'T REALLY QUITE STUCK UP DOES IT YEAH DEFINITELY
IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM I'M JUST HOW FRUSTRATING IS IT IF INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING I WOULD ACTUALLY
MY BUSINESS COULD I WORK FROM HOME AS WELL AS WORK ON CLIENT RIGHT
DEVON PATTERSON THIS IS NOT JUST A NICE TO HAVE IS IT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO RUN BUSINESSES PEOPLE LEAVING OR LIVING IN BUILT UP AREAS WHO ARE JUST SIMPLY NOT GETTING THE SERVICE THEY NEED AND DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY ASSURANCE FROM YOU THAT IT'S GOING TO CHANGE WE RECOGNISE IT'S IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE WAY PEOPLE LIVE AND RUN THEIR BUSINESSES TODAY BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE
NINETY PER CENT COVERAGE OF SUPERFAST BROADBAND COMPARES VERY WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE MANAGER YOUR PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF LONDON AND IN SHEFFIELD NOT THERE ARE NOT SO WE WOULDN'T DENY THAT WE WILL LOOK TO ADDRESS THOSE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS INDEED THE ROLL OUT OF THE THE CURRENT PHASE OF BROADBAND HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED YET SO THAT WILL GET TO OVER NINETY FIVE PERCENT BY THE END OF TWENTY SEVEN PLACES WHERE THERE'S NO COVER THESE ARE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE A SERVICE BUT IT'S JUST NOT FAST ENOUGH
AS I SAID WE WILL LOOK AT THOSE BUT IT COMPARES VERY WELL WITH EVERY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRY I'M NOT SAYING IT'S PERFECT AND WE'VE GOT MORE WORK TO DO ABSOLUTELY AND WE'RE READY TO MAKE THE UPGRADE TO TO ULTRA FAST AS WELL BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T GOT IT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TWENTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE AND PREMISES ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE U.K. HAVE GOT IT TODAY
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE IT AND IT'S WORKING VERY WELL YOU SEEM TO HAVE DIFFICULTY AND SPENDING MONEY ON OPENREACH BUT NO DIFFICULTY AND SPENDING MONEY ON SPORTING RIGHTS FOR EXAMPLE NINE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS THAT YOU'VE PAID FOR THREE SEASONS WORTH OF FOOTBALL RIGHTS
NOT SO OPEN IT SHE'S COMPLETELY REGULATED THE PRICING IS REGULATED NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF THEIR PRICING IS REGULATED BY OFCOM THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT WAS NOT INTERRUPTING ABOUT THE PRICE I'M TOLD HER I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT INVESTING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY NINE HUNDRED POUNDS TO SPEND ISN'T IT ON ON FOOTBALL RIGHT INDEED BUT IT IS IT'S VERY IF IT'S RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED WITH THE MONEY WE SPENT ON ON FIBRE SO WE SPENT ALMOST THREE BILLION POUNDS
INVESTING IN IN SUPER FAST BROADBAND OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND WERE PREPARED TO INVEST AGAIN AS I SAID TO GET US UP TO A TRUST BUT IF IT'S OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO PUT THAT NINE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS INTO INTO OPENREACH YOU COULD GET QUITE FAR WITH THOSE NOT SPOTS AS YOU CALL THEM WITH PEOPLE SPEED COULDN'T YOU
THE TWO POTS THE BUSINESS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE SO THE CONSUMER BUSINESS PAYS FOR ITS OWN INVESTMENTS INCLUDING ITS INVESTMENTS IN SPORTS
INVESTMENTS IN IN IN OPENREACH ARE INDEPENDENT OF THAT AND AS I SAID WE'RE PREPARED TO INVEST AGAIN TO FINISH OUT THE ROLL OUT OF THIS FIRST STAGE ADDRESS SOME OF THE NOT SPORTS AND INVESTING IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGY ULTRA FAST IF THEY'RE THAT SEPARATE BEN THEN HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE WOULD WOULD IT MAKE TO YOU FOR THEM TO BE BROKEN UP THE POINT TO BE ONE COMPANIES YOU CAN MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE AT IT AT HIGH LEVEL CAN'T YOU THE PARENT LEVEL ON WHAT YOU SPEND MONEY ON
IT'S THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE IS IT'S IT'S A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING SEPARATING OPENREACH OUT AS A AS A SEPARATE BUSINESS FROM FROM THE REST OF B.T. THERE ARE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WE HAVE TO LOOK AT CHANGING THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS WERE SIGNIFICANT PENSION ISSUES
HE LEAVES ISSUES THAT WOULD NEED TO BE RENEGOTIATED CONTRACTS ALL THIS YOU'RE NOT UNDERTAKE JUST QUESTIONED WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE BEING DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE BUSINESSES CONSUMER BUSINESS AND
OPENREACH AND YET THERE OUGHT TO BE A BENEFIT AND HAD AN ADVANTAGE TO YOU AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS AT YOUR LEVEL ON WHAT YOU SPENT ON WHAT I THINK THERE'S A BENEFIT TO THE COUNTRY'S A WHOLE OF THEM BEING PART OF THE SAME GROUP AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IT WE CAN TAKE LONG TERM DECISIONS BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE OF THE GROUP AS A WHOLE IT MEANS YOU CAN TAKE INVESTMENT DECISIONS WAS PAYBACK PERIODS OF TWENTY YEARS
KNOWING THAT ULTIMATELY THE BUSINESS CAN TAKE THAT SORT OF RISK IF IT'S AN INDEPENDENT OPENREACH ARE SEPARATE OPENREACH I DOUBT WHETHER YOU'D BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE SORTS OF DECISION SO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN THEN AND IN THE NEXT
FIVE YEARS YOU WOULD IDEALLY LIKE THINGS TO STAY EXACTLY AS THEY ARE OR ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THE FACT THAT RIVALS LIKE DIED TO BE NEXT COULD BE GETTING A MUCH GREATER SHARE OF WHAT OF WHAT YOU HAVE AT PRESENT NO I WE WE WELCOME THE REPORT WE WE DON'T THINK WE'RE PERFECT WE KNOW THERE ARE AREAS WE CAN IMPROVE AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO TO GO THROUGH THE FINDINGS WITH OFCOM TO SEE HOW THINGS CAN GET BETTER

THANK YOU THE TIME TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE A MAN WHO IS ONE OF THE BIG FIGURES OF BRITISH POLITICS FOR A GENERATION OF SELF DESCRIBED LIFELONG EUROPEAN COMES OUT TODAY IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION DAVID OWEN LORD OWEN AS WRITTEN IN THE SUN MY DECISION IS A CONFIDENT ONE NOW IS THE TIME TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND LORD OWEN IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT IF ANYTHING COULD DAVID CAMERON HAVE COME BACK WITH FROM BRUSSELS THAT MIGHT HAVE PERSUADED YOU TO STAY
WELL A PROPER RESTRUCTURING OF EUROPE WHICH IS BADLY NEEDED WE HAVE GOT TO CHANGE THE TREATY LANGUAGE ABOUT THE EUROZONE AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE THE EUROZONE WORK AND WE ARE BEING ASKED TO DO THIS ALMOST EVERY YEAR SINCE THE CRISIS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
SOME PEOPLE SAY WERE JUST WAITS UNTIL IT COLLAPSES BUT THE DANGEROUS FOR US EVEN OUTSIDE THE EUROZONE IF IT WERE TO COLLAPSE WOULD BE VERY VERY CONSIDERATE
AND I THINK THAT ACTUALLY BRITAIN'S EXIT IS A WAY OF GETTING THAT RESTRUCTURING AND HIM FRANKLY THE EUROZONE IS MUCH TOO LARGE FOR A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN IT THAT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE SUSTAINED
AND WE NEED TO REALLY CHANGE THE WHOLE THING NEEDS TO BE SMALLER ITS LAWS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AND OUTSIDE WE NEED TO HAVE A MUCH WIDER
EUROPEAN TRADING ARRANGEMENTS IT IF I'M THAT EXISTS IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIC IF THAT HAPPENS THOUGH AS A RESULT OF HER DEPARTURE WHICH IS OPPOSED AND RESENTED BY A LOT OF OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND IS DONE IN A DISORDERLY WAY A WAY IN WHICH THEY HAVEN'T PLAN THROUGH WHICH IS B. WOULD WE BE WHAT BRITISH BRECK'S IT WOULD BE THEN THAT SURELY IS WHAT PUT IT MONKEY A RISK DOING EVEN MORE DAMAGE TO AN ALREADY SHAKY SENSED
WHEN YOU SAY DISORDERLY AND HASN'T BEEN THOUGHT THROUGH I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT IS THE CASE YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT IF YOU HAD SAID THAT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT FOR A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD AND INDEED THERE WAS SOME ARGUMENT YOU COULDN'T EVEN LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
BUT IN THE TREATIES NOW THERE IS PROVISION IN ARTICLE FIFTY FOUR A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD WHICH RUINED BROKE IF YOU WISH TO GO AND DAVID CAMERON'S ALREADY SAID HE IS GOING TO INVOKE THAT IF HE IS FACED BY HER DECISION TO LEAVE SO WE NOW AT WITHOUT DAMAGING THE EUROPEAN UNION
I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE SENSIBLE JUDGEMENTS BY A BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF DOING IT NOW WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT'S THERE FOR FOUR YEARS THE FIXED TERM PARLIAMENT
THERE'S NO IMMEDIATE PRESSING ELECTION AND THE GOVERNMENT CAN SEE THROUGH A TRANSITION PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS EFFECTIVELY AFTER ALL WHERE ONLY BEEN ARSED AND LET'S FACE IT WAS DAVID CAMERON WHO ASKED US HE'S BEHIND THE REFERENDUM HE CHOSE THE REFERENDUM YOU CAN'T PUT A REFERENDUM BEFORE THE BRITISH PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY OPTION THAT'S TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE THERE IS A CHOICE AND THIS GOVERNMENT WILL IMPLEMENT IT HE SAYS HE WANTS TO REMAIN
AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT'S NOT MY CHOICE OF PRIME MINISTER BUT I'M NOT INTERVENING THIS ISN'T ANOTHER ELECTION ALL YOU'RE DOING IS SAYING WE WANT TO COME OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN AN ORDERLY WAY IF YOU DECIDE TO SEE GOVERNMENT USE ARTICLE FIFTY YEARS HE SAID HE WELL I THINK THAT'S PERFECTLY WITH A JOKE TRUFFLY GOOD JUDGEMENT
AND I RESPECTED AND YOU CAN EVEN EXTEND IT IF IT BY AGREEMENT WITH THE E.U. SO YOU COULD EVEN TAKE A THREE UP TRAFFICKERS WHAT A MOMENT YOU WERE FOREIGN SECRETARY WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT SORT OF WIDER ARGUMENT ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT MOMENT GIVEN THE MANY CRISES THERE ARE SWIRLING AROUND THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT SWIRLING ROUND EUROPE AT THE MOMENT WELL THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT MOMENT TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS POTENTIALLY DESTABILISING BUT MICHAEL FALLIN ON THE PROGRAMME THE OTHER DAY WAS TALKING ABOUT
EUROPEAN DIPLOMACY WHEN IT CAME TO TO RUSSIA OR NEW KREED AND SAYING THAT BRITAIN HAD WITHIN EUROPE BEEN A CENTRAL VOICE IN GETTING SOMETHING SANCTIONS ORGANISED AGAINST THE RUSSIANS AND WITHOUT BRITAIN BEING PART OF THAT THEN EUROPE WOULD HAVE FALLEN APART NOT HAVING A COMMON VIEW ARE YOU NOT AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN SPENT SO MUCH OF YOUR LIFE INVOLVED IN MULTILATERAL ORGANISATIONS AND DIPLOMACY OR YOU NOT JUST A BIT WORRIED LET'S TAKE UKRAINE YOU RAISED IT
AS FAR AS MINSK AGREEMENTS THE BRITISH LEARNT ABOUT THE FRENCH AND THE GERMAN PROPOSAL LITERALLY AS THEY WERE TRAVELLING TOWARDS SINCE THEY WERE NOT DISCUSSED WITH THEM THE E.U. YOU UKRAINE AGREEMENT ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT ACTUALLY TRIGGERED THIS WAR THE WORDING IN IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY
AND IT'S NOW BEEN CHALLENGED AND STENT IN A REFERENDUM IN NETHERLANDS IN APRIL AMONG THOSE I THINK THE YEAR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED AND I BELIEVE THAT THE WORDING ON THE LANGUAGE INVOLVING A HUGE AMOUNT ABOUT DEFENCE AND MILITARY ISSUES AT THAT STAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN INFLAMMATORY TO GORBACHEV YELTSIN IN MADRID
AND PUTIN AND I THINK IT WAS VERY FOOLISH LANGUAGE AND MANY PEOPLE NOW DEEPLY REGRESSES WHO WAS ATTACKED IN NUMBER OF ACADEMIC JOURNALS THE MOST RECENT ONE THE CHATHAM HOUSE IT'S JOURNAL SO WE'VE GOT TO FACE UP TO IT MADE SOME QUITE SOME SUITABLE DIPLOMATIC MISTAKES ON THE WHOLE WEREN'T HANDING HIM FEW CRANE I HAPPENED TO BE STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA AND I THINK
THE DEFENCE SECRETARY'S CORRECT I THINK BRITAIN DID ARGUE FOR THOSE SENSIBLY BUT THERE ARE OTHERS TRUE AND THE THESE SORT OF SANCTIONS WERE IMPOSED NOT JUST ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES ARE COMING FROM THE UNITED STATES SO WE HAVE ACTED IN CONCERT OVER SANCTIONS BECAUSE THAT WAS ANNEXING OF CRIMEA IN PARTICULAR AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU SHOULD SHIFT ON THAT AT ALL
I WANT TO SEE NATO STRENGTHENED I WANT TO SEE INCREASED SPENDING ON VENTURE AND I THINK THAT IT'S A GREAT WEAKNESS THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO BOTH OF THE SYRIAN CRISIS AND UKRAINE CRISIS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH US THIS MORNING THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE THE BROADCASTER TONY BLACKBURN SAYS HE HAS BEEN SACKED BY THE B.B.C. AFTER FORTY NINE YEARS WITH THE CORPORATION BECAUSE OF THE EVIDENCE GIVEN TO THE DAME JANET SMITH REVIEW ON JIMMY SADDLE AND THE B.B.C. REPORT WILL BE PUBLISHED AT TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING WE'RE JOINED ON THE LINE BY A DAVE CASH ALSO VETERAN RADIO PRESENTER WORKED AT RADIO ONE AND KNOWS TONY BLACK THEN GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THIS MORNING I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY TOTALLY OUT OF CHARACTER FOR TONY TO BE INVOLVED IN ANYTHING LIKE THIS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE REPORT I MEAN NOBODY DOES BUT WHATEVER HAPPENED TO INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY WELL AND WELL AT THE MOMENT WE ONLY HAVE HIS VERSION OF EVENTS BECAUSE THE B.B.C. HASN'T SAID ANYTHING AT THIS POINT CAN YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL ISSUE THOUGH IF THE B. B. C. BELIEVES THAT HE WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT AN ALLEGED INCIDENT BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AND HE SAYS HE NEVER WAS
WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT INCIDENT IT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IT'S HARD FOR ME TO COMMENT ON THAT I JUST THINK IT'S PRETTY HARSH TO TO DO THAT TO SOMEBODY WHO IS THAT POPULAR ANNA'S GIVEN THAT MUCH SERVICE TO THE B.B.C. AND FROM WHAT I KNOW OF TONY AND ANOTHER UM OVER FIFTY YEARS AND I WORK WITH THEM OVER FIFTY YEARS HE'S NOT THAT KIND OF GUY
NOT AND HE SAID HE'S A CLEARLY HE'S NOT GUILTY OF ANY INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT NOT THAT KIND OF GUY AND WHAT WHAT DID YOU SEE IN THE SAME SORT OF PERIOD IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES YOU WORK FOR EXAMPLE ON ON TOP OF THE POPS
WHAT WAS THAT TIME LIKE IN TERMS OF BROADCASTERS AND AND THEN THERE WAS LITTLE YEAH THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF IT GOING ON AND I MEAN IT ALL CAME OUT WITH THE SADDLE SITUATION I WAS QUITE LUCKY COS I WAS MARRIED AT THE TIME SO I DIDN'T REALLY AFFECT ME THAT MUCH
AND TONY WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP AS I REMEMBER AND DO YOU KNOW YOU'D YOU'D SIGN THE AUTOGRAPHS AND SOMETIMES A PERSON'S ARM OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT I MEAN THAT THAT ALL WENT ON BUT I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT HAVING KNOWN TONY ALL THESE YEARS I DON'T THINK HE'S THE KIND OF GUY WHO WOULD MAKE AN IMP
INAPPROPRIATE ADVENTURE WE SAY BUT HOW DO YOU THINK THIS SORT OF THING SHOULD BE DEALT WITH GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THE B.B.C. TO TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT WAS KNOWN ABOUT JIMMY SADDLE AT THE TIME I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE ONE SHOWN TONY THE REPORT IF THEY WERE GOING TO YOU KNOW SACK HIM
IT IS A CONCERN TO EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND I'M VERY SORRY THAT TONY HAS BEEN CAUGHT UP IN IT BUT AS FAR AS HIS GUILT IS CONCERNED I PARTICULARLY HAVING NOT SEEN THE REPORT BUT KNOWING HIM I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S INVOLVED YOU HAVE HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HIM
NO I HAVEN'T NO RIGHT SO
SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING THIS MORNING BUT HIS STATEMENT IS IN THE DAILY MIRROR AND WE WILL HEAR FROM THE B. B. C. AFTER THE REPORT IS PUBLISHED LATER THIS MORNING DAVE CASH THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME NINETY MINUTES TO NINE LLOYDS BANKING GROUP OR SET ASIDE ANOTHER HUGE WODGE OF MONEY FOR PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE TWO POINT ONE BILLION POUND SILENCES YES HE REALLY IS THE WRECKING BALL THAT WAS ONCE AGAIN PUT A HUGE DENT IN LLOYD'S PROFITS THE ADDITIONAL TWO POINT ONE BILLION POUND PROVISION TAKES THE SIZE OF THE TOTAL COMPENSATION KITTY
TO A COLOSSAL SIXTEEN BILLION POUNDS FOR LLOYD'S ALONE THAT ASIDE THE BANK WOULD HAVE MADE OVER EIGHT BILLION POUNDS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT'S A FIVE PER CENT RICE COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR PETER HOME IS CORPORATE FINANCE OFF SAUL WAS CORPORATE FINANCE OFFICER AT CITY GROUP IS NOW PROFESSOR OF BANKING AT THE INSTITUTE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES GOOD MORNING IT THESE BANKS MUST BE HOPING THAT THE F.C.A. THE WATCHDOG WHICH HAS SAID IT MIGHT BE PROPOSING IS GOING TO COME UP WITH SOME TIME LIMIT ON THIS
I'M SURE THEY ARE AND ACTUALLY IT'S IT'S PROBABLY BETTER FOR THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY STILL CLEANING UP TOO FAR BEHIND SO WE NEED TO GO FORWARD IF YOU TAKE THAT AWAY THE DIFFERED END THEY'RE PUTTING UP THAT SEEMS LIKE A SIGN OF CONFIDENCE AND BETTER HEALTH AT THE BANK
IT IS WHEN WE MOTIVES OR I WILL TAKE THE RESULTS QUICKLY
FOR LOUISE TO TEAMS LIKE THE ECONOMY HAS HANDLE IN THE FACTORY ACTUALLY GROWN SOME LOGGO
PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT TO INVESTORS AT LLOYD'S IS THERE LLOYD'S HAS MANAGED TO KEEP COSTS UNDER CONTROL
AND ACTUALLY REDUCE THEM SLAY WEEK WITH INCREASED REVENUE WENT BAD
THE SIGN OF SOMEBODY WHO SHOULD BE GENERATING CASH TO PLAY WHATEVER OH KAY AND THE TREASURY OF COURSE WANTED TO GET RID OF ITS REMAINING NINE PER CENT STAKE EARLY THIS YEAR AND HAD TO POSTPONE THAT WILL THAT BE BACK ON THE TABLE SOON
IT SHOULD BE INCREASING THE DIVIDEND SHOULD HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE SHARES BUT THERE'S ANOTHER MESSAGE I THINK ALSO

SELL IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT MIS SELLING SCANDALS OF ALL TIME I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY FIVE BILLION POUNDS HAS BEEN PAID BACK OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT'S ACTUALLY PROBABLY BEEN A HUGE STIMULUS FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY WILL MISS THOSE PAYMENTS WHEN THEY STOP
WELL YES I CERTAINLY THINK IT WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST STIMULUS AFFECT YOU CAKE KIND OF
I NOTICED IN THE RESULTS THERE WAS ACTUALLY ANOTHER RESERVES FOR ANOTHER TYPE OF MISSELLING SETTLING

SIMON THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE HOW LONG IS TOO LONG TO BE OUT OF TOUCH WITH YOUNG PEOPLE ON A TRIP ABROAD BEFORE YOU FEAR SOMETHING MAY HAVE GONE WRONG A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD BACKPACKER GRACE TAYLOR SPARKED A GLOBAL SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN AND A POLICE SEARCH AFTER HER MOTHER HADN'T HEARD FROM HER FOR FIVE DAYS SHE'S NOW HOME SAFELY FROM THAILAND IN DECEMBER THE FAMILY OF ANOTHER YOUNG BRITISH TRAVELLER TO THAILAND JORDAN JACOB'S BECAME CONCERNED FOR HIS WELFARE
HE SAID LATER THAT THEY WERE OVER REACTING WE'RE JOINED NOW BY SUE BRYANT EDITOR OF JENNY'S MAGAZINE FROM BELFAST BY LYNSEY HILL HE'S TWENTY THREE AND A STUDENT AND HAS BEEN ON TWO TRIPS TO THAILAND GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING GOOD MORNING SUE BRYANT I'M SURE YOU TRAVELLED IN YOUR YOUNGER DAYS WITHOUT BEING IN CONTACT FOR
DAYS AT A TIME WEEKS AT A TIME WHEN I I BACKPACKED IN MID EIGHTIES NIGHT WHEN I WAS IN MY TWENTIES AND MOBILE PHONES HADN'T BEEN INVENTED INTERNET HADN'T BEEN INVENTED SO WE COMMUNICATED BY AIRMAIL LETTERS AND I WAS CROSSING AFRICA SO I PICKED UP MAIL TWICE IN FOUR MONTHS AND THAT WAS IT BUT IN THIS CONNECTED AGE COS WE HAD VERY DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS OF
THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT WE CAN BE IN TOUCH WITHOUT WITHOUT WORRYING YEAH WE LOST SOMETHING THEN IN THE PROCESS LOST SOMETHING IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL YES IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO JUST
ABSORB WHAT'S AROUND YOU NOT WORRYING ABOUT WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE IN A WAY I THINK YES THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE AND I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE USED TO KEEP IN TOUCH IF YOU MANAGE THE EXPECTATIONS OF YOUR FAMILY BACK HOME IF THEY WANT YOU TO KEEP IN TOUCH KEEP IN TOUCH BUT EQUALLY I THINK THERE'S A PRESSURE TO BE POSTING ALL THE TIME ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHILE YOU'RE TRAVELLING AT THE BLOG UPLOADED AND NOT ACTUALLY SIT AND LOOK AROUND YOU AND I HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPENING
HOW DO YOU MANAGE THE EXPECTATIONS AND COS YOU'RE THE PARENT OF I AM TRAVELLING TEENAGER SHE TRAVELLED FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST YEAR YES OF COURSE I WAS TERRIFIED BUT WHAT DID YOU SAY IN TERMS OF YOUR EXPECTATION I SAID I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS I KNOW YOUR ITINERARY SO PLEASE JUST CHECK IN WITH ME AND SHE DID SHE SENT SHORT TEXTS AND WHEN SHE DIDN'T I STOPPED HER ON INSTAGRAM SHE WAS POSTING THERE SO BUT I WAS I WAS AND SOMETIMES SHE WOULD WANT LONG TEX TEX CHATS WHEN SHE WAS ON A BORING TRAIN JOURNEY
WELL THAT WAS IN EUROPE I THINK IN THAILAND IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WHEN HE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED MORE THAN EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS AND YOU JUST MAKE AN AGREEMENT I THINK AND I THINK THESE FAMILIES WERE RIGHT REALLY TO BE ALARMED IF THEY IF THE AGREEMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN AND THEY HADN'T HEARD FROM THEIR THEIR CHILDREN SO IT WORKED LINDSAY HILL SO WHEN YOU BET ON THESE TRIPS TO TO THAILAND YEAH HOW OFTEN WERE YOU IN TOUCH WITH YOUR FAMILY I TRIED TO CONTACT THEM EVERY DAY BUT OBVIOUSLY SOMETIMES IF I WAS MORE RURAL THERE WASN'T REALLY
MENTION ACCESS BUT I WOULD HAVE INFORMED THEM PROBABLY BUT YOU'RE O.K. BEFORE THEY WERE GOING TO BE OUT OF CONTACT AND IT DIDN'T IT DID YOU DO THAT WILLINGLY OR DID YOU FEEL UNDER PRESSURE TO TO BE IN TOUCH I WONDER IF YOU THINK IT TOOK ANYTHING AWAY FROM YOUR TRAVEL EXPERIENCE I WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN ANYTHING AWAY I THINK IT WAS JUST IMPORTANT ABOUT THEM NO I WAS SAFE COS OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO WORRY BACK HOME BUT I ME I WOULDN'T HAVE
POSTED A BLOG OR ANYTHING I WOULD HAVE UPLOADED PHOTOS MAYBE
YOU DID THE OTHER DAY RIGHT AND THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE BLOG DAY I WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN LIKE A SORT OF SCRIPTED
OF WHAT I WAS DOING ALL THE TIME THERE'S A THERE'S A CONCERT WE HEAR ABOUT DIGITAL NOMADS MAY BE WANDERING THE WORLD BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE ALWAYS CONNECTED IN A ALWAYS POSTING PHOTOGRAPHS OR WHATEVER ABOUT YOUR TRIP IS IS THAT HOW YOU SEE YOURSELF
NOT REALLY I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO POST TOO MUCH WHILE I WAS AWAY AND OBVIOUSLY I WOULD HAVE CHECKED INTO REALLY BIG TOURIST ATTRACTIONS ON THE FIRST TRIP BUT THE SECOND TRIP I WAS WORKING
SO I WASN'T POSTING DEARLY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I WAS TEACHING FOOTBALL WHEN YOU WERE POSTING DALEY DID YOU FEEL THAT YOU WERE STILL GETTING AWAY FROM IT ALL GETTING AWAY FROM YOUR NORMAL LIFE BACK IN THE U.K. OH YEAH DEFINITELY BECAUSE THE EXPERIENCE ITSELF IS A LOT DIFFERENT THEN LOVE HIM BACK HOME
AND OBVIOUSLY THAT SORT OF NAMES THAT YOU HAVE A LOT DIFFERENT AND WHILST YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IT'S NOT
IT'S NOT THE SAME SORT OF SPEED SO STUFF DOESN'T LOAD AND YOU'RE QUITE LUCKY IF YOU CAN POST SOMETIMES SEEM BRIGHT HOW WOULD YOU FELT HAVE IF YOUR PARENTS OBVIOUSLY WAS A DIFFERENT TIME IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS BUT BUT IF IT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER AND TRAVELLING THE AGE THAT YOUR DAUGHTER IS NOW YOUR PARENTS HAVE SAID CHECK IN WITH ME EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS BUT IT JUST WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
I MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOT POSSIBLE I WAS CROSSING AFRICA AND EVEN WHEN I WAS BACKPACKING IN THAILAND WAS IN MY LATE TWENTIES THEN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PAYPHONE BUT I MEAN THEY JUST DIDN'T EXPECT IT IT'S IT JUST WASN'T IN THE CULTURE THEN TO DO THAT IT MAKES FOR A DIFFERENT TRAVEL EXPERIENCE DOESN'T IT IN TERMS OF LOSING YOURSELF OR IMMERSING YOURSELF IN IN WHERE YOU ARE
IF YOU HAVE TO CHECK IN AT THE TIME YES IT DOES I MEAN WHEN I'M TRAVELLING NOW I CHECK IN BACK HOME WITH THE CHILDREN I I POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA EVERY NOW AND THEN IF I'M ON HOLIDAY I DO SWITCH OFF WHICH IS FANTASTIC BUT YES BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE CROSSED MY PARENTS' MINDS TO SAY CHECKIN BECAUSE THEY KNEW THERE WAS NO WAY OF DOING IT SO BRIAN LINDSAY THANK YOU BOTH
ELEVEN MINUTES TO NINE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT NICK ROBINSON THIS MORNING COS WE SENT HIM TO SWINDON AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM FOR AN HOUR HE'S TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU BECAUSE OF COURSE IT ISN'T JUST THE POLITICIANS OF THE CAMPAIGNERS WHO CAN I HAVE A CAN I HAVE THE FINAL SAY BUT VOTERS AS WELL LET US HOPE THAT HE IS IN TOUCH WITH US NOW HELLO NICK
WORRY NOT JUSTIN WORRY NOT I TELL YOU WHERE I'VE COME TO YOU I'VE COME TO DOTTIE'S ALL TOWN CAFE IN SWINDON TO HAVE MY BREAKFAST BECAUSE AN HOUR AGO AS YOU MAY RECALL WE WERE DOING AEROBICS AND BEFORE THAT
DAWN ON A FARM JUST OUTSIDE SWINDON WHY ARE WE DOING ALL THIS WE'RE TRYING TO HEAR PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES OF THE E.U. THE QUESTIONS THEY'VE GOT BEFORE THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEIR DECISION IN THE BACKGROUND YOU HEAR GRAHAM IS COOKING UP SOME BACON HERE WHO RUNS AND OWNS THIS CAFE GRIP DO YOU HAD A SENSE DOESN'T AFFECT YOU MUCH DOES IT
NOT AS A CAFE OWNER BUT IT USED TO AFFECT ME IN THE PLANT HIRE INDUSTRY WHERE I WORKED YOU KAY AND ACROSS EUROPE YEAH AND THEREFORE DOES IT MAKE PRO AGAINST WHAT ARE YOU BEGINNING TO ASK WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT TO DO IN THIS REFEREE
I'M FIRMLY AGAINST WE SEEM TO HAVE NO CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS WE HAVE NO CONTROL ON IMMIGRATION AND
WE JUST DON'T SEEM TO RULE OURSELVES ANY MORE OVER CONTROLLED FROM OUTSIDE OF THESE THESE FOUR WALLS EVEN OR SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE BASED ABROAD USED TO DO BUSINESS IN THE Y. YOU'RE SCEPTICAL YES VERY LET'S GO AND TALK TO SOME OF YOUR CUSTOMERS THEN AS I COME HERE HAVING THEIR BREAKFAST I'VE JOINED BY DAVID WHO RUNS A IMPORTANT PACKAGING FIRM IN THIS TOWN WHICH HAS MANY BLOTCH MANUFACTURERS AND I'M JOINED BY LAWRENCE AS WELL HE RUNS A LOCAL ACCOUNTANCY
DAVID WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW THE E.U. LOT RUNS EFFECTS HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS LIKE YOURS WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT
PHEW HE'S FAIRLY BALANCE THAT WE WE EXPORT PROBABLY ONLY ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT OF OUTPUT DIRECTLY TO EUROPE AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE ONLY SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE BEST SOLUTION
WE HAVE LOST BUSINESS IN EUROPE TO SUPPLIERS OUTSIDE OF EUROPE SO WE ARE NOT PROTECTED IN IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS THAT WE DO THAT DO YOU WORRY IF WE GOT OUT THAT THE RULES MIGHT BE RIGGED AGAINST YOU THAT IN SOME WAY NOT NECESSARILY TAXES OR TERRORISTS BUT THE REGULATIONS MIGHT BE USED TO STOP YOU COMPETING
THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK OF THAT BUT EQUALLY THERE'S A RISK JUST TO STAYING IN AS WELL AND THERE IS
EQUAL DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND THAT AS WELL WHAT'S THE RISK OF STAYING IN THAT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN EUROPE CONTINUES TO ESCALATE BECAUSE THE SOCIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WOOD YOU'RE PICKING UP LAWRENCE FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT YOU ADVISE IN A TOWN LIKE THIS IS THE E.U. SEEN AS A BURDEN ALL RIGHT
I DON'T THINK IT'S A BURDEN AT ALL I THINK THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BUSINESS IS EXPORTING INTO EUROPE IS A VERY POSITIVE THING
A LOT OF MY BUSINESSES WERE RELY ON HONDA HERE AND IF THEY WERE
NEGATIVE TARIFFS IF WE CAME OUT OF EUROPE I THINK A LOT OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE A LIVING IN THIS IN THIS
AND PEOPLE MIGHT SAY ENHANCE THAT THEY'RE NEVER GONNA BE NEGATIVE TEST OUT WHAT A SELL THEIR CARS WHY ON EARTH WOULD THEY DO THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS FORMED ITSELF INTO TRADING BLOCS THESE DAYS YOU HAVE THE THE BRICKS NATIONS YOU HAVE THE NATION'S WITH ENGLAND BE IT COULD BE ON ITS OWN IN BETWEEN OTHER GROUPINGS IN AMERICA
JAMES THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S TIME FOR US TO HAVE A BACON AND EGGS JUST IN KNICKERS I THINK WE DESERVE IT DON'T YOU ALTHOUGH GUESS WHAT IN SWINDON THE POWER'S JUST GOT OFF TO THE BACON STOP SIZZLING NO THE POWER'S GONE OFF IN SWINDON
