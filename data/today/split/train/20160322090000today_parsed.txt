MOST SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND TEACH CHILDREN SOMETHING ABOUT SEX RELATIONSHIPS DRUGS AND MONEY BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO INCLUDE IT IN THE TIMETABLE LUCY POWERLESS SHADOW EDUCATION SECRETARY SAYS SOCIAL MEDIA HAS OVERTAKEN GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES
HEALTH CHARITIES ENGLAND'S CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AND MANY M.P.S OF ALL ARGUED PERSONAL EDUCATION SHOULD BE COMPULSORY BUT EARLIER THIS YEAR THE GOVERNMENT REJECTED GIVING IT STABBED THREE STATUS IN FAVOUR OF GIVING SCHOOLS INFORMATION TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN LESSONS
CLEAR DIFFERENCES ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS WERE ON SHOW WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS CUBAN COUNTERPART ROLL CASTRO WERE QUESTIONED BY THE MEDIA IN HAVANA MY CASTRO APPEARED ANNOYED TO BE ASKED ABOUT HIS REGIME'S TREATMENT OF POLITICAL DISSENTERS AUNG SAN SOO CHI LED HER OPPOSITION PARTY TO VICTORY IN ELECTIONS IN MYANMAR IN NOVEMBER IS TO BE A MINISTER IN THE COUNTRY'S FIRST CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS HER NAME WAS AMONG EIGHTEEN ANNOUNCED IN THE BURMESE PARLIAMENT THIS MORNING

THOMAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND AFTER THE ABANDONMENT OF SCOTLAND YARD'S V.I.P. PAEDOPHILE MURDER INQUIRY THAT IS THE LEAD FOR THE DAILY MAIL AND FOR THE SUN THE DAILY MAIL SAYS HUMILIATION OF THE YARD AFTER SIXTEEN MONTH PROBE INTO CLAIMS OF THE I.P. ABUSE POLICE CONCEDE THERE IS NOT A SCRAP OF EVIDENCE IT SAYS
THE FORCE OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE FORCE TRIED DESPERATELY TO JUSTIFY THE PROBE'S SAYING IT HAD BEEN HANDLED WELL BUT IT REFUSED TO SAY SORRY TO THOSE WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN RUINED OR REPUTATIONS SHATTERED THE SUN'S HEADLINE HOW CAN HE STAY A REFERENCE TO SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE THE COMMISSIONER OF THE MET AND THE TIMES COUNTS THE COST OF INVESTIGATING CHILD ABUSE AND IT SAYS IT HAS REACHED A BILLION POUNDS A YEAR TO THE
A POLICE HISTORICAL COMPLAINTS ACCOUNT FOR TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL OF THE PAPER SAYS THE RAPIDLY INCREASING NUMBER OF REPORTS HAS BEEN PUT DOWN TO ONLINE ABUSE AND ALSO THE AUTHORITY'S ABILITY TO SPOT SIGNS AND TO TAKE CLAIMS SERIOUSLY
THE OTHER BIG STORY IT'S THE LEAD FOR THE INDEPENDENT AND THE GUARDIAN IS THE BUDGET STILL THE GUARDIAN SAYS DAVID CAMERON WAS FORCED TO CONCEDE YESTERDAY THE FOUR AND A HALF BILLION POUND BLACK HOLE CREATED BY THE U. TURN OVER DISABILITY BENEFITS WOULD NOT BE FILLED BY MORE CUTS TO WELFARE AS HE FOUGHT TO SHORE UP HIS CREDIBILITY FOLLOWING THE SHOCK RESIGNATION OF IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AND THERE'S
A LEADING ARTICLE IN THE NEWSPAPER WHICH IF I CAN FIND IT SAYS
HE HAS BEEN FINGERED BY MISTER DUNCAN SMITH MISTER OSBOURNE THAT IS FOR TAKING THE MONEY HE HAD HOPED TO SNATCH FROM THE POOR AND GIVING IT TO THE RICH MISTER OSBORNE MAY REFLECT THAT SOME PRIDE ON HAVING SURVIVED AT THE TOP OF THE POLITICAL GAME FOR AS LONG AS HE HAS WITH HIS CLAIM THAT THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE BUT AS HE EMBARKS ON HIS SECOND SCREECHING YOU TURN IN A FEW MONTHS IF HE IS TO BUY THESE IF HE IS TO SURVIVE IS GOING TO HAVE TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE LINE OF ARGUMENT
THE TIME IS NOW TEN PARSECS A COMPUTER EXPERT HAS MANAGED TO BREAK INTO ONE OF APPLES I PHONES AND THE F.B.I. ARE DELIGHTED ABOUT A NORTH AMERICA TECHNOLOGY REPORTER IS DAVE LEE A BIT OF BACKGROUND
THE BACKGROUND HERE IS THERE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW THE F.B.I. HAS BEEN TRYING TO DEMAND THEIR APPLE HELPS IT LOOSENS SECURITY ON THE I PHONE BELONGING TO THE SAN BERNARDINO TERRORIST SIDE FOR RUTH I MUST ADD THAT THE WHICH THE F.B.I. SAYS THERE MAY BE A WAY TO BREAK INTO THE EYE OF HOME BUT THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY SURE YET WHAT THEY'VE REQUESTED FOR MORE TIME TO TRY OUT THE METHOD THAT APPARENTLY EMERGED JUST HOURS BEFORE A HEARING WAS DUE TO PLACE TAKE PLACE
IN IN CALIFORNIA TODAY SO ALL VERY DRAMATIC LATE TWIST IN THE TOWER THAT MEANS A HEARING THAT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON TUESDAY WILL NOW BE POSTPONED WHILST THE F.B.I. TRIES THIS NEW TECHNIQUE THAT CAME FROM AN OUTSIDE PARTY SO OUR APPLE LIKELY TO BE PLEASED BECAUSE THEY'RE OFF THE HOOK NO MORE PRESSURE ON THEM ALL WORRIED THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN GET IN TO A SECURE SYSTEM
WELL IT'S AN INTERESTING MIX OF MEAN ON THE ONE HAND I'M SURE APPLE DIDN'T WANT THIS DAY IN COURT IT'S GOING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED BY PERHAPS SOME OF THE VICTIMS OF THE FAMILIES AND SAMBO AS FAR AS WORRYING ABOUT THE SECURITY OF ITS OF ITSELF SOFTWARE THE COMPANY LIKE ANY STUFF WAY MAKE HAS NEVER SAID ANYTHING'S COMPLETELY SECURE BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE THAT'S THAT'S HER NAME
THAT NO COMPANIES ACHIEVE WHICH IS WHY SOFTWARE IS CONTINUALLY UPGRADE HERE WHICH IS WHY YOU GET PATCHES EVERY NOW AND THEN FOR OUR COMPUTERS AND OUR PHONES AND SO THEY WILL I'M SURE BE TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT THIS VULNERABILITY YEARS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD WHAT IT IS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD WHERE THE WHO THE OUTSIDE PARTIES EITHER SO THEY WILL BE LOOKING INTO WHAT THAT HOLE IS BECAUSE AS IF IF APPLE IS TO BE A RESPONSIBLE SOFTWARE MAKE OR THEY'LL BE WANTING TO
PLUG THAT HOLE BECAUSE IF THE F.B.I. CAN USE IT TO ACCESS THE PHONE THAT MEANS ANYBODY WHO HAS THE SAME INFORMATION ABOUT THIS VULNERABILITY COULD USE IT TO HACK ANY I FIND POTENTIALLY SO A VERY SERIOUS SECURITY ISSUE FOR APPLE
GREAT THANKS VERY MUCH THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX BARACK OBAMA WILL MEET CUBAN DISSIDENTS TODAY AS PART OF HIS HISTORIC PRESIDENTIAL VISIT AFTER A NEWS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY THAT PROVED RATHER TESTING FOR HIS CUBAN COUNTERPART ROLL CASTRO A HAVANA CORRESPONDENT WILL GRANT WAS WATCHING
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE BASED IN HAVANA WE HAVE NEVER SEEN A MOMENT LIKE THIS WITH REAL CASTRO I DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT HIM TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE WAITING JOURNALISTS BUT CLEARLY THE WHITE HOUSE HAD PERSUADED HIM THAT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA SO HE WAS TAKING UNSCRIPTED QUESTIONS FROM THE WORLD'S MEDIA
AND HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM VERY COMFORTABLE IN DOING SO HE SEEMED ACTUALLY VISIBLY ANGRY HE WAS CHALLENGED ON THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA ON POLITICAL PRISONERS SPECIFICALLY AND HE ANSWERED WHO ARE THESE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND GIVE ME A LIST AND THEY'LL BE RELEASED BY THE END OF TONIGHT HE SEEMED VERY VERY FRUSTRATED THAT HE WOULD BE
PUT INTO THIS POSITION AND HE'S NEVER BEFORE ANSWERED QUESTIONS AND SUCH AN UNSCRIPTED AND DIRECT AWAY ON HIS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD AND OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE SO SO THOSE OF US WHO ARE HERE AND FOLLOW THIS PARTICULAR STORY WEEK IN AND WEEK OUT IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MOMENTS OF THEIR VISIT AND PRESIDENT OBAMA GOES ON TO MEET SOME CUBAN DISSIDENTS TODAY
YES AND THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE TRIP HE MADE THAT VERY CLEAR IN THE WHITE HOUSE MADE THAT VERY CLEAR THAT HE WOULDN'T BE COMING HERE IF HE WASN'T FREE TO DO THAT OBVIOUSLY HE HAS TO DO THAT IN THE PRIVACY OF THE U.S. EMBASSY IN HOW ABOUT THAT BUT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM AND IT STILL REMAINS TO BE SEEN EXACTLY WHICH OF THE WELL KNOWN DISSIDENTS WILL TURN UP OFTEN THEY'RE INVITED TO CERTAIN EVENTS BUT ALMOST
TO SHOW THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TALKING TO THAT CASTRO GOVERNMENT THEY THEY STAY AWAY WHICH ONE WOULD THINK WOULD BE A BIT COUNTER PRODUCTIVE TO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHICH IS ACTUALLY GET THE EAR OF THE WHITE HOUSE SO WE'LL SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT BUT I THINK
THE EMBALMER ADMINISTRATION WOULD SAY THAT'S NOT THE KEY POINT OF THIS TRIP THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HIMSELF CALLED IT A NEW DAY IN SPANISH HE SAID ESSEN WHERE WOULD THE EAR AND I THINK FOR MANY CUBANS IT'S IT'S REALLY BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE ONE
WELL GRANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUARTER PAST SIX CHINESE GROWTH HAS BEEN SLOWING A LOT AS WE HAVE LEARNED TO OUR COST SUPPOSED TO A COS THAT'S THE QUESTION REALLY ADAM WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BUSINESS IN GENERAL BUSINESS IN GENERAL AND BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS BEEN WATCHING AT THE SLUGGISH GROWTH OF CHINA WITH SOME TREPIDATION
PARTICULARLY COMPANIES INVOLVED IN AREAS SUCH AS OIL AND ESPECIALLY MINING THOSE HAD LONG BENEFITED FROM THE BOOM AFFECT CHINESE GROWTH HAD ON COMMODITY PRICES BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR BRITISH COMPANIES EYEING UP CHINA AS A PLACE TO DO BUSINESS NOW WHAT A MAJOR CONFERENCE TAKES PLACE IN LONDON TODAY'S GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THAT LORDS ASSOON AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CHINA BRITAIN BUSINESS COUNCIL FORMER TREASURY SECRETARY JOINTS IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR BRITISH COMPANIES NOW TO LOOK TOWARDS CHINA LESS IMPORTANT OR MAYBE A YEAR AGO
NOW IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I HAD A NEW DESCRIBE GROWTH AS SLUGGISH THIS IS GROWTH THAT LAST YEAR WAS SIX POINT NINE PER CENT IN CHINA AND THE THIRTEENTH FIVE YEAR PLAN WHICH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS JUST PUT OUT SAYS THE GROWTH WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF SIX AND A HALF TO SEVEN PER CENT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CHINESE ECONOMY WHICH IS GROWING BY THE SIZE OF SOMETHING BETWEEN
THE BELGIAN ECONOMY IN THE SWISS ECONOMY THAT'S THE SIDE THAT'S THE CREATION OF ECONOMIC POWER THAT THEY'RE GENERATING EVERY YEAR SO THE OPPORTUNITY OF BRITISH COMPANIES IS NEVER BETTER WHICH IS WHY THE ANNUAL TRYING TO BRITAIN BUSINESS COUNCIL CONFERENCE HAS IS GOING TO HAVE FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE TODAY TALKING ABOUT THIS ARE YOU CONVINCED THIS IS A TWO WAY STREET COS WE OFTEN HAVE THE CRITICISM THE CHINA IS VERY GOOD AT SPENDING ITS MONEY ON OVERSEAS COMPANIES OVERSEAS ASSETS BUT NOT SO GOOD AT WELCOMING
INVESTMENT FROM ABROAD FROM BRITISH COMPANIES THAT SAY WELL THERE ARE BARRIERS IN DEALING WITH ANY COUNTRY BUT BUT NO CHINA IS EXTRAORDINARILY WELCOMING I MEAN JUST TO TAKE ONE SECTOR OF THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR IN IN CHINA WHICH IS ONE WHICH PLAYS TO U.K. STRENGTHS IT'S ALREADY A SECTOR IN WHICH CHINA SPENDS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION U.S. DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WILL PROBABLY GROW TO A TRILLION IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
THAT IS ONE SECTOR WILL BE DISCUSSING TODAY OF MANY IN WHICH THE THE OPPORTUNITY IS ENORMOUS AND THE ACCESS IS GETTING BETTER YEAR ON YEAR WITH THE PROSPECT OF THE REFERENDUM LATER THIS YEAR ARE YOU FINDING THAT THERE ARE MORE COMPANIES COMING TO YOU ASKING FOR ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO GO TO CHINA ALMOST AS A BACK UP PLAN
CHINA CHINA COMPANIES ARE COMING TOO TO US WANTING TO HELP WITH ACCESS TO TO CHINA I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S CARRYING ON VERY STEADILY QUITE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE QUESTION OF BRECHT'S IT'S ON AT THE OPPORTUNITY IS SO ENORMOUS IN CHINA AND THIS IS A COUNTRY WHERE THE SERVICE SECTOR IS UNDOUBTEDLY GROWING AT MORE THAN TEN PER CENT A YEAR
AND WHETHER IT'S IN HIGH END MANUFACTURING LUXURY GOODS YOU NAME IT IT PLAYS TO WHAT BRITISH COMPANIES HAVE TO OFFER AND THE TRYING TO BRITAIN BUSINESS COUNCIL I LAPSE INTO CALLING AT THE C. B. B. C. THAT HERE THAT'S CONFUSED SOMETIMES WITH SOMETHING ELSE FOR THE CHINA BRITAIN BUSINESS COUNSEL IT CAN CAN CAN DO EVERYTHING THAT BRITISH COMPANIES NEEDS ALONGSIDE YOU KATIE ITER ACCESS THAT MARKET IT'S CHALLENGING BUT NOT NEARLY AS DIFFICULT AS PEOPLE THINK
LOTS OF THIN CHAIRMAN OF THE C. B. B. B. C. MAYBE SHE'LL HAVE A YOUNG YOUTH VERSION CALLED THE SEA B.B.S THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND WILL REPORT ON THAT CONFERENCE YESTERDAY THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX FINISHED JUST A CHEF DOWN AMERICA'S DOW JONES WAS UP A LITTLE BIT IN THE U.S. THERE IS ONE STORY THAT'S CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION OF MANY INVESTORS A COMPANY CALLED VALIANT
UNDERGOING AN EXTRAORDINARY PERIOD OF UPHEAVAL OUR MARKETS GUESS THIS MORNING IS JUST BELOW ORLA ANALYST FROM C.M.C. MARKETS JUST RUFFLED MANY PEOPLE WON'T KNOW WHAT VALIANT IS WHAT IS IT AND WHAT'S GOING ON AT MONEY ELLEN IT'S WHICH CANADIAN COMPANY BUT LIST IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY
WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE OUR OWN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES BUT WHAT MADE VALIANT QUITE SPECIAL AND MADE THE SHARE PRICE PERFORM VERY WELL OVER THE PREVIOUS FEW YEARS WAS THAT IT WAS ON A BIG BUYING SPREE HE BOUGHT A LOT OF THESE BIOTECH COMPANIES
SO IN THAT DRIVE FOR GROWTH ALL THESE BIOTECH COMPANIES BEING BOUGHT OUT THEY'VE BEEN CHARGING VERY HIGH PRICES FOR SPECIALITY DRUGS THAT WAS THEIR BUSINESS MODEL WAS CREATING A NEW DRUG FOR A VERY NICE DISEASE AND THEN CHARGING VERY HIGH PRICES
THE TROUBLE FOR THIS COMPANY AND FOR BY ATTACKS IN THE U.S. IN GENERAL IS THAT THE PRICES HAVE COME SO THEY SHARE PRICES ARE COME MASSIVELY DOWN BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON AND A LOT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE REALLY GOT INVOLVED IN THIS LOO CLINTON JUST IN MARCH IN EARLIER THIS MONTH A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ADS SAYING I'M GOING TO COME AFTER THEM SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS COMPANY VALIANT PHARMACEUTICALS
AND THE WHOLE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN IN TROUBLE JUST SINCE A TWEET THAT SHE MADE AT THE END OF LAST YEAR SAYING THAT THIS THIS IS PRICE GOUGING AND WE NEED TO PLAN TO COME OUT AGAINST THIS SO SHE'S COME OUT AGAINST THE WHOLE INDUSTRY SO THEY'RE ALL INDUSTRIES IN PROBLEMS BUT THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY HAS ITS OWN SET OF REAL DIFFICULTIES IT'S C.E.O. JUST GOT SACKED YESTERDAY THEY TRIED TO SEND THE FORMER SEA OFF THE BOARD
HE'S REFUSED TO DO SO IT'S TURNING INTO A BIT OF A SORT OF SHAKESPEAREAN FAST AT THIS POINT NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEY HAVE ESSIE SEE INVESTIGATIONS AT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN USING SIDE COMPANIES TO SORT OF FORCE BOTH INSURERS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS INTO BUYING THESE HIGH PRICE DRUGS SAY THEY CAN'T USE ANY KIND OF CHEAP GENERIC ON THE A SORT OF FINANCIAL ENGINEERING AS AN ACTIVIST INVESTOR CALLED BELIKE THEN I'M BRIEFLY SHOULD KNOW BIG INVESTORS BE ACTIVE US JUST
I THINK THEY SHOULD AND THE EVIDENCE OF THE PAST FOR YEARS THAT ACTIVIST INVESTORS HAVE BEEN DOING SOME FAMOUS ONES LIKE CAR LIKE ON BLACK MEN IS A VERY FAMOUS ONE DAY TYPICALLY OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE SEE OUT ON THE BABY'S OUT ON THE TELEVISION TELLING US WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO MAKE COMPANIES BETTER BUT HE WAS THE BEST PERFORMING HEDGE FUND MANAGER IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN NOT SO MUCH THIS ONE COMPANY HAS REALLY CAUSED HIM A LOT OF PROBLEMS HE'S GOT THUNDERS DOWN TWENTY PERCENT LAST YEAR AND HE LOST US A BILLION DOLLARS IN JUST ONE DAY LAST WEEK BECAUSE OF THIS COMPANY VALIUM YES YOU WON'T BE THE TOP PERFORMER AT THE MOMENT ARE JUST FOR MANY THANKS TO YOU
NOW JUST HOW MUCH A BOOST TO THE ECONOMY IS THE LEGAL PROFESSION FIRST FIGURES FROM THE LAW SOCIETY UP TODAY TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS TWENTY FIVE BILLION POUND SECTOR THAT'S A PROPER NUMBER CRUNCHING CLOSE FOR ONE PERCENT GROWTH IN LEGAL SERVICES YOU CAN EXPECT A BOOST OF EIGHT THOUSAND JOBS EVERY POUND OF EXTRA TURN OVER ANOTHER ONE I'M THIRTY NINE AND THE REST OF THE ECONOMY OR THE LAW SOCIETY CHIEF EXECUTIVE CATHERINE DIXON JOINS US GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING
SOME FASCINATING FIGURES IN THIS HOW DO YOU WORK IT OUT BECAUSE IT ISN'T THE LEGAL WORLD A CLASSIC SERVICES SECTOR DOESN'T THE MONEY JUST SORT OF EFFECTIVELY SWIRL AROUND NO IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SO WE'VE WE'VE WORKED OUT THAT FOR EVERY ONE POUND EXTRA TURNOVER IN THE LEGAL SECTOR THAT CONTRIBUTES ONE POUND THIRTY NINE TO THE REST OF THE ECONOMY AND SO FOR EVERY
EXTRA HUNDRED JOBS THEN THERE'S A FURTHER SIXTY SEVEN JOBS IN THE ECONOMY AND AS WE SAID THE THEY THE LEGAL SECTOR IF IT GROWS BY ONE PERCENT WERE ACTUALLY CREATING EIGHT THOUSAND NEW JOBS ADDING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE MILLION POUNDS TO THE ECONOMY WHAT'S ALL THIS GROWTH
COMING FROM AND HE SAYS WHY DO WE NEED THIS CONSTANT GROWTH IN SO SO PRIMARILY THEY DATE THE GROWTH IS COMING FROM THE BUSINESS SECTOR AND WE ALSO HAVE A VERY HIGH VALUE OF OF EXPORT AS WELL AND OUR EXPORT VALUES HAVE BEEN GROWING
CONSECUTIVELY ACTUALLY FOR THAT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS AT AN AVERAGE OF FIVE POINT SIX PERCENT SO THE TOTAL EXPORT VALUE IS FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION WHICH IS A NET OF THREE POINT SIX BILLION WHICH IS POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTING TO THE U.K.'S BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SO THIS IS REALLY GOOD NEWS STORY
QUIT THORNE ON THE FUTURE FOR LAW FIRMS ARE WE GOING TO SEE MASSIVE CONSOLIDATION HUGE NO FUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A HUGE ACCOUNTANCY GIANTS I THINK WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE MORE CONSOLIDATION ACROSS ACROSS THE MARKET LAW FIRMS TEND TO BE CONFIGURED AND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY TO TO THE TO THE ACCOUNTANCY BUT I THINK WE WILL SEE THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE ARE SOON INCREASED COMPETITION GLOBALLY WITH EMERGING MARKETS ENGLAND AND WALES IS THE JURISDICTION OF CHOICE YOU KNOW WE'RE SET
LEGAL EXCELLENCE FROM ACROSS THE WORLD BUT BUT YOU KNOW WE ARE WE HAVE GOT INCREASING COMPETITION CATHERINE DIXON FROM THE LAW SOCIETY MANY THANKS TO YOU NOW THE EQUAL PAY ACT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ALMOST FIFTY YEARS AFTER THAT REPORT FROM M. P. SELECT COMMITTEES OUT THIS MORNING ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT ARE FAILING TO TAKE ACTION TO CUT THEIR GENDER
I GET THE WOMEN AND A QUALITY SELECT COMMITTEE SAYS THE GOVERNMENT IS COMPLICIT IN A SYSTEM THAT UNDERMINES PRODUCTIVITY MAINTAINS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PLAY OF MEN AND WOMEN SARAH JACKSON CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CHARITY WORKING FAMILIES MORNING TO YOU MORNING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT MIGHT AND ANYTHING HAPPENED WELL I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T ADDRESSING THE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO WOMEN FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE LABOUR FORCE FORCE THERE ARE THREE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE LOOKED AT ONE IS THE PART TIME PAY PENALTY BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF PART TIME WORKERS ARE WOMEN
THE SECOND IS THAT WOMEN ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR UNPAID CARE SIR CHILDCARE AND ALL OTHER FORMS OF CARE WHICH I AND THAT OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS THE PROGRESSION IN THE WORK AND THE THIRD IS WOMEN'S CONCENTRATION IN LOW PAID SECTORS LIKE CARE AND CATERING AND RETAIL SO WHAT THE COMMITTEE IS SAYING IS THAT
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE TAKING ACTION TO SUPPORT MEN AND WOMEN TO SHARE CHILDCARE MORE EQUALLY AND OTHER FORMS OF CARING TO HELP WOMEN BACK INTO WORK WHEN THEY HAD A BREAK FOR CARING AND TO TACKLE THE LACK OF QUALITY PART TIME JOBS WHICH IS TRAPPING MANY WICKED WOMEN IN WORK BLOW THEIR SKILLS THE ESTIMATES ARE THAT THERE'S ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY MOSTLY WOMEN WHO WERE WORKING PART TIME AND WOULD LIKE TO BE DOING WORK AT A HIGHER LEVEL
TO MATCH THEIR SKILL SET DO YOU THINK SARAH JACKSON THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS A LACK OF ROLE MODELS IS A LACK OF REPRESENTATION IN THE BOARDROOM OR IS IT AS YOU SAY IN A SENSE THIS FACT THAT WOMEN STRUGGLE TO COME BACK INTO WORK AFTER STARTING FAMILIES IT'S THE LATTER AND SO WHAT WHAT I'M REALLY PLEASED ABOUT THIS REPORT SAYING IS THERE LOOKING THEY'RE SAYING THAT
ALL JOBS SHOULD BE ADVERTISED FLEXIBLY BY DEFAULT UNLESS THERE'S AN ABSOLUTELY CLEAR REASON BUSINESS REASON WHY NOT BECAUSE THAT WOULD IMMEDIATELY OPEN UP A MUCH WIDER TALENT POOL TO EVERY EMPLOYER AND THEY'RE ALSO CALLING FOR THREE MONTHS YOU'D USE IT OR LOSE IT LEAVE FOR FATHERS BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS SHARED PARENTAL LEAVE US ARE TRANSFERABLE LEAVE IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE MOTHERS WE KNOW FROM ALTHOUGH IT'S PROVING POPULAR WITH THAT WITH THE MILL ELLY NELLIE AND FATHER FATHERS
IT IS WE KNOW FROM INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE THAT WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IS SOMETHING THAT IS THE MUMS ALONE TO TAKE AND WE SAW A LEAP AND GERMANY FROM THREE PER CENT THIRTY PERCENT OF FATHERS TAKING LEAVE ONCE IT WAS THEIR OWN AND IT WAS PROPERLY PAID AND THE LAST THING THAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING WHICH I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT'S A SIX WEEK ADJUSTMENT LEAVE PERIOD BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK TO PARENTS WHO'VE GOT A DISABLED CHILD OF PARENTS HOOF PEOPLE HAVE BECOME CARERS
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED HAVE LEFT WORK AT THE POINT THAT THE CHILD WAS MISDIAGNOSED
WE RECKON THAT A SIX WEEK BREAK GIVES YOU TIME TO ADJUST TO REAL LIFE CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEN GET BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR JACKSON CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CHARITY WORKING FAMILIES

TURNS ON DISABILITY BENEFITS THE TAMPON TAX AND VAT ON SOLAR PANELS BUT
IT WILL BE I THINK I'M MUCH MORE CONTRITE AND EVEN HUMBLE GEORGE OSBORNE BECAUSE HE WILL SAY THAT HE IS SORRY HE IS SORRY THAT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS RESIGNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT HE WILL GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO PRAISE MISTER DUNCAN SMITH FOR HIS ACHIEVEMENTS AND HIS WORK IN TRYING TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF WELFARE DEPENDENCY
HE WILL SAY THAT IS LISTENING AND TAKING ON BOARD THE CONCERNS OF HIS M. PEAS AND AS HIS SEEMINGLY OBLIGATORY IN TORY CIRCLES NOW HE WILL COMMIT HIMSELF TO
COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM AND YOU HAVE TO SAY WHAT A CONTRAST TO YOU KNOW JUST A DAY OR SO AGO WHEN THE LINE WAS IT WAS ALL IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S FAULT HE WAS A MAN WHO'D COME UP WITH THE DISABILITY BENEFIT REFORMS IN THE FIRST PLACE HE HAD AGREED TO THEM IN THE BUDGET NOW
IT SEEMS HE WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG I'M TEMPTED TO SAY IAN DUNCAN SMITH APPEARS TO HAVE ACHIEVED MORE IN HIS RESIGNATION HE DID IN SIX YEARS OF GOVERNMENT AND RESISTING SO CALLED TREASURY SALAMI SLICING BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAS HE SECURED THE AGREEMENT TO BACK OFF OVER DISABILITY BENEFITS HE SECURED A MUCH MUCH BIGGER CONCESSION WHICH IS A COMMITMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BRING FORWARD ANY
FURTHER CUTS TO THE WELFARE BUDGET FOR THE REST OF THIS PARLIAMENT RIGHT WHICH IS A MASSIVE MASSIVE CONCESSION IS THAT THAT IS REALLY WHAT IT MEANS IS IT NO MORE
WELFARE BENEFIT CUTS FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS AND IF THAT IS THE CASE WHERE ARE THE CUTS GOING TO COME FROM WELL LET'S BE CLIPPED ON THEY'VE LEFT THEMSELVES A WRINKLE OF WRIGGLE ROOM SAYING THERE ARE NO PLANS STEPHEN CRAB YESTERDAY SAY WOULD BE ABSURD TO SAY NEVER EVER BUT LET'S BE HONEST THE POLITICS AS SUCH AND GIVEN THE STATEMENT YESTERDAY I THINK THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY COULD COME BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE CHANGED OUR MIND IS ALMOST NIL
WHAT IT MEANS IS GEORGE OSBORNE NOW HAS A FOUR BILLION POUND BLACK HOLE IN HIS BUDGET AND ACTUALLY IT MAY BE QUITE A BIT BIGGER BECAUSE THE VIEW FROM GOVERNMENT IS THE DISABILITY BENEFITS BILL IS UNSUSTAINABLE IT IS GROWING AT AN UNAFFORDABLE RATE OF ONE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR SO FAR FROM A FOUR BILLION POUND BLACK HOLE IT MAY BE INCREASING BY A BILLION A YEAR AND
GEORGE OSBORNE'S OPTIONS ARE NOW SEVERELY LIMITED IS A BIT LIKE GULLIVER TIE DOWN AND ALL SIDES BECAUSE HE CANNOT TOUCH THE N.H.S. BUDGET HE CANNOT TOUCH THE PENSIONS BUDGET HE CANNOT TOUCH THE OVERSEAS AID BUDGET HE CANNOT TOUCH THE SCHOOLS' BUDGET AND NOW HE CANNOT TOUCH THE ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE WELFARE BUDGET
AND YOU'RE LESS SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD SAYING WHERE ON EARTH IS HE GOING TO GET THE MONEY AND HOW ON EARTH DOES HE MEET HIS CENTRAL TARGET OF BALANCING THE BOOKS BY THE END OF THIS PARLIAMENT AND OBTAINING A TEN BILLION POUND SURPLUS OF SURPLUS WHICH MANY PEOPLE ALREADY THOUGHT WAS BASED ON HEROIC ASSUMPTIONS ANSWERS ON A POSTCARD PLEASE THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT WILL UNVEIL IT INCOME TAX PLANS TODAY WITH NICOLA STURGEON THE FIRST MINISTER SETTING OUT WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO WITH NEW POWERS TO VARY THE RATE IN SCOTLAND A SCOTLAND POLITICAL EDITOR BRIAN TAYLOR JOINS US FROM GLASGOW WHAT'S SHE GOING TO SAY BRIAN SHE WILL SET OUT THE THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSALS WITH REGARD TO TAX HEARING THAT ABOUT THE THE CONTROVERSY AT AT WESTMINSTER IF YOU LIKE THIS IS NEXT DOOR AND CINEMA TO WITH THIS IS THE SEQUEL
MISSUS OSBORNE TO BECAUSE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SCOTLAND IS YOU HAVE A LOVER VIEWING THE CUTS THAT OUT THAT A VEIL OF COURSE THOSE SPREAD THROUGH TO SCOTLAND AND YOU HAVE NICOLA STURGEON DRIVERS PARTICULARLY IN THE LABOUR PARTY SAYING YOU DON'T LIKE THE CUTS YOU'VE GOT THE TAX BARS CARRY ON AN INCREASED TAX THE LABOUR AND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE PROPOSED A ONE PARENT ONE PER CENT INCREASE
ON THE SCOTTISH WRIGGLING INCOME TAX ACROSS ALL BANDS TO RAISE NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS FOR EDUCATION AND THE REST I DO NOT THINK NICOLA STURGEON WILL GO DOWN THAT ROAD SHE'S ALREADY SAID THAT SHE BELIEVES THIS WOULD BE SIMPLY PENALISING THE POOL IN SCOTLAND AS SHE PUTS IT TO PAY FOR GEORGE OSBORNE'S CAN'T SHE WON'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD I DO THINK THOUGH THAT LIKE LABOUR AND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHE WILL SEEK TO REVERSE THE INCREASE ON THE FORTY PENCE THRESHOLD THAT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD BY RISA OSBORNE WHAT'S A INVOLVING
A TAX BENEFIT TO HIGHER EARNERS I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE ASKED THAT AND SHE MAY LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS BUT BEYOND THAT IT'S PRETTY LIMITED BECAUSE IT'S TAX RATES AND BANDS WERE TALKING ABOUT IN SCOTLAND AND THAT'S THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HER ABILITY AND NORTH OF THE BORDER AND WHAT IS SET BY
BY WESTMINSTER AND OF COURSE THE IMMEDIATE THING FOR ALL SCOTTISH POLITICIANS AHEAD IS THE ELECTION THAT'S COMING ABSOLUTELY ELECTIONS ON MAY FIVE AND NICOLA STURGEON IS TORN LIKE THE OTHERS THE S.N.P. HAVE AN APPARENTLY SIGNIFICANT LEAD IN THE POLLS WHICH IS SADLY DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THAT ERODED SHE'S TORN HOW SHE'S TORN BETWEEN LABOUR RHETORIC THAT SAYS
INCREASE THE OVERALL RATES BY ONE PER CENT IN SCOTLAND ALSO SHE'S LABOUR ARE SAYING INCREASE OF FORTY FIVE RATE TO FIFTY PENCE FOR THOSE EARNING MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND JUST TORN BY THAT APPROACH AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE THE CONSERVATIVES SAYING PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND SHOULD NOT BE MORE TAX THAN THOSE IN THE REST OF THE U.K. WITH BUT NICOLA STURGES TORN I THINK BETWEEN THE DICHOTOMY OF THE THE WHAT HE HAS ALREADY SAID OUR GESTURES
ON TAX AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT WAS MAINTAINING SCOTLAND'S COMPETITIVENESS SHE IS AWARE OF THE NEEDS THE LEAVE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH HAS GENERALLY BEEN PREDICATED UPON MAKING SCOTLAND COMPETITIVE OFFERING AN EDGE TO THE ECONOMY AND SO I THINK FOR EXAMPLE THAT I'D EVEN INCREASE
FORTY FIVE PENCE TO FIFTY I THINK NICOLA STURGEON IS IS LEERY ABOUT THAT WATCH IS OF THE VIEW THAT PERHAPS IT BRINGS IN BUTTONS AND THAT FOLK EARNING THAT SORT OF CASH COULD PROB PROBABLY SHIFT THEIR MONEY ELSEWHERE IN A DODGE IT
BRIAN TAYLOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN SCOTLAND YARD HAS BEEN FORCED TO DUMP OPERATION MIDLAND THE EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING INQUIRY INTO OUR ALLEGATIONS THE VARIOUS ESTABLISHMENT FIGURES WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE SERIOUS SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN MANY YEARS AGO NOW THE COLLEGE OF POLICING HAS SAID POLICE FORCES SHOULD FURTHER IMPROVE THE CONFIDENCE OF SEXUAL ABUSE VICTIMS TO REPORT ALLEGATIONS I'M JOINED BY
OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE DANNY I REMEMBER TALKING TO THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONERS OF BERNARD HOGAN HOWE ON THIS PROGRAMME JUST RECENTLY WHO SAID THE POLICE HAVE GOT TO CHANGE THAT ABUSE THEY SHOULDN'T UNCONDITIONALLY BELIEVE WHAT VICTIMS SAYING THESE TWO IN CONTENT CONTRADICTION OF EACH OTHER I DON'T THINK THEY'RE IN CONTRADICTION NECESSARILY JOHN BUT I THINK THEY ARE LINKED I THINK THAT INTERVIEW YOU DID WITH SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOW THE CONTROVERSY THAT FOLLOWED ABOUT WHETHER VICTIMS SHOULD BE BELIEVED OR NOT
AND HAS LED TO A MEETING BETWEEN SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS WHICH WAS CONVENED BY THE COLLEGE OF POLICING AND NOW A LETTER WHICH HAS GONE OUT FROM ALEX MARSHALL THE COLLEGE OF POLICING CHIEF EXECUTIVE IT WAS SENT ON FRIDAY SO JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE MET FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THE CLOSURE OF OPERATION MIDLAND AND IT IS REALLY TRYING TO CLARIFY THE APPROACH THAT POLICE SHOULD TAKE IN THESE CASES WHERE VICTIMS COME FORWARD WITH ALLEGATIONS SOME OF THEM HISTORICAL ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE
AND IT IS SAYING TO POLICE LOOK WE HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN ENCOURAGING VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD IN MAKING THEM FEEL MORE CONFIDENT IN GIVING THEM TRUST IN THE POLICE AND WE DON'T WANT TO STOP THAT PROGRESS ALEX MARSHALL ACTUALLY SAID IT IS IMPORTANT THE PROGRESS IS NOT LOST AND THERE WAS AGREEMENT HE SAID AT THE MEETING THAT CONTINUED EFFORT IS NEEDED TO FURTHER IMPROVE THIS CONFIDENCE
AND HE THEN GOES ON TO OUTLINE THE APPROACH THAT THE POLICE SHOULD TAKE BUT WHEN HE SAYS SOMEONE IF SOMEONE MAKES AN ALLEGATION POLICE SHOULD BELIEVE THEIR ACCOUNT AND RECORDER CRIME UNLESS THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY WHAT I THOUGHT THE LAW WAS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THAT IT SAYS HELLO SOMEBODY
HE'S INNOCENT UNTIL THEY'RE PROVED GUILTY THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE SUSPECT THIS IS ABOUT WHEN SOMEONE MAKES AN ALLEGATION THE ACCOUNT SHOULD BE BELIEVED HE OTHERWISE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE UNLESS IT IS CLEAR THAT NO CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED AND THAT A FENCE SHOULD BE LOCKED THAT IS WHAT POLICE SHOULD DO FOR THE PURPOSES OF RECORDING THE OFFENCE THERE THEN HE'S A SECOND STEP WHICH IS THE INVESTIGATION
AND OVERSEE INVESTIGATION CAN ONLY BEGIN ONCE A CRIME HAS BEEN RECORDED AND IT'S AT THAT POINT THAT THINGS CHANGE A BIT AND THAT THE POLICE APPROACH IS DIFFERENT THEY SHOULD BE ACCORDING TO THIS GARDEN A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE FACTS AND ALLEGATIONS MADE THAT SHOULD FOCUS ON THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ALLEGATION RATHER THAN FOCUSING SOLELY ON THE VICTIM
AND THAT IS REALLY ALL SET OUT AN EXISTING GUIDANCE THERE'S NOTHING NEW ABOUT THE GUIDELINES THAT AT THE COLLEGE OF POLICING ARE SETTING OUT BUT IT'S RESTATING IT CLEARLY BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE KNOWLEDGE AT LAST MONTH MANY THANKS THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THEIR SON SEES THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE NEW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO PLANS FOR FURTHER WELFARE CUTS
AS A HUGE U. TURN FOR THE PAPER HIS STATEMENT MARKS A SEA CHANGE AFTER FIVE YEARS OF SHAVING BILLIONS OFF THE BENEFITS BILL THE FINALITY FINANCIAL TIMES SAYS MY CRAB STUNNED THEM PEAS AS THE GOVERNMENT FOUGHT TO CONTAIN THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S RESIGNATION THE INDEPENDENT BELIEVES THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS IN FULL RETREAT AFTER WHAT IT CALLS HIS SHAMBOLIC BUDGET
THE SPOTLIGHT WILL FALL ON MISTER OSBORNE WHEN HE SPEAKS OF THE COMMONS TODAY THE TELEGRAPH SAYS HE WILL BECOME THE FIRST CHANCELLOR FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS TO CLOSE A BUDGET DEBATE IN A BID TO SALVAGE HIS LEADERSHIP AMBITIONS THE MALE REPORTS AT MANY M. P. C. IT IS A MAKE OR BREAK MOMENT FOR HIM THE MIRROR TALKS OF HIM EMERGING FROM HIDING AS A DIMINISHED FIGURE
OF TIMES THINKS HE SUDDENLY VULNERABLE HIS GRIP ON THE PARTY IS SLIPPING AND HIS JUDGEMENT CALLED INTO QUESTION THE GUARDIAN FEELS THE COLLAPSE OF THE INVESTIGATION INTO AN ALLEGED V.I.P. PAEDOPHILE RING IS A HUMILIATING RETREAT FOR THE METROPOLITAN POLICE THE MALE
ADOPTS A SIMILAR TONE WITH THE FRONT PAGE HEADLINE HUMILIATION OF THE YARD THE SUN TAKES THE MET TO TASK SAYING THAT FROM START TO FINISH THERE WAS A LOATHSOME ARROGANCE ABOUT THE WAY THE FALLS CONDUCTED WHAT THE PAPER CALLS A WITCH HUNT MANY OF THE FRONT PAGES HAVE THE IMAGE OF PHILIP'S WIPING AWAY A TEAR OUTSIDE MANCHESTER CROWN COURT AFTER CLAYTON WILLIAMS WAS SENTENCED TO TWENTY YEARS FOR KILLING HER HUSBAND POLICE CONSTABLE DAVE PHILLIPS THE METRO

THE MIRROR SO SHE TOLD THE COURT HOW HER TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS CRY FOR THEIR DADDY WANTING HIM BACK THE SPORTS WRITERS ARE DIVIDED OVER COMMENTS BY THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TENNIS PLAYER NOVAK DJOKOVIC THAT MALE PLAYERS SHOULD EARN MORE THAN WOMEN BECAUSE THEIR GAMES ARE MORE POPULAR WITH SPECTATORS KEVIN MITCHELL IN THE GUARDIAN ACCUSES HIM OF GETTING THE EQUALITY DEBATE HORRIBLY WRONG MATTHEW SYED IN THE TIMES HOWEVER ARGUES THAT DJOKOVIC WAS RIGHT AND HE WAS MERELY STATING
COMMON SENSE THERE'S ALSO CONSIDERABLE COMMENT ABOUT ROMAN MORE THEIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE INDIAN WELLS AT ORNAMENT AND WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE WOMEN'S GAME BUT SINCE THE PAPERS WERE PRINTED HE HAS RESIGNED FROM HIS POSITION
THE GUARDIAN GETS A TICKING OFF IN ITS LETTERS PAGE FOR A MISPRINT MELVIN THOMPSON FROM CUMBRIA COMPLAINS THAT MONDAY'S CROSS WOOD WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN QUICKER TO COMPLETE OF THE CLUE FOR EIGHTEEN ACROSS HAD REFERRED TO HEALTH INSTEAD OF HEATH
HE CANNOT RESIST TEMPTATION SAYING IT MAKES AN ELEMENT OF IT KEPT OUR MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WILL GO TO THE COMMONS TODAY TO DEFEND HIS BUDGET IN THE WAKE OF IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S RESIGNATION AND THE DECISION TO ABANDON FURTHER CUTS TO WELFARE BENEFITS
THE GOVERNMENT SAID YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT IT WOULD NOT TARGET OTHER BENEFITS TO PAY FOR ABANDONING CUTS TO DISABILITY PAYMENTS THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME TO ONLY WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB WHO REPLACED IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AFTER HE QUIT IT WITH THE CUTS EARLIER DAVID CAMERON DEFENDED GEORGE OSBORNE BUT LABOUR SAID HE SHOULD GO TO A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN
IT WAS SHAPING UP TO BE A DAY OF PARLIAMENTARY DRAMA AS LABOUR'S SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL ROSE TO ASK AN URGENT QUESTION ABOUT CHANGES TO LAST WEEK'S BUDGET DO YOU ASK THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER IF HE WILL MAKE A STATEMENT
MISTER MCDONNELL HIS SUPPORTERS AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE CROWDED HOUSE OF COMMONS KNEW THAT GEORGE OSBORNE HAD STAYED AWAY FROM THE CHAMBER INSTEAD OF THE CHANCELLOR AND PEAS WOULD HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH THE TREASURY MINISTER DAVID GORK JOHN MCDONNELL SAID THAT AFTER JUST FIVE DAYS THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS HOLE IN THE BUDGET
ISN'T IT THE PRUDENT THING FOR THE CHANCE TO DO IS WITHDRAW THIS BUDGET AND START
MISTER SPEAKER THIS IS NO WAY TO DELIVER A BUDGET AND NO WAY TO MANAGE AN ECONOMY
DAVID GORK PEPPERED HIS REPLIES WITH THE PHRASE LONG TERM ECONOMIC PLAN ENSURING PLENTY OF CHEERS FROM THE CONSERVATIVE SITTING BEHIND HIM AND HE WAS SOON ON THE ATTACK THERE IS NO QUESTION OF THIS GOVERNMENT CUTTING DISABILITY BENEFITS BACK TO THE LEVEL WE INHERITED
AFTER ABOUT FORTY MINUTES OF THESE EXCHANGES THERE WAS A LOUD CHEER FROM THE CONSERVATIVE BENCHES HERALDING THE ARRIVAL OF DAVID CAMERON AS THE PRIME MINISTER TOOK HIS SEAT HE GAVE DAVID GORK A FRIENDLY PAT ON THE ARM
MY CAMERAMAN HAD BEEN FORCED TO WAIT BEFORE MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT LAST WEEK'S E.U. SUMMIT BUT OF COURSE HE ALSO SPOKE ABOUT MATTERS CLOSER TO HOME AFTER A WEEKEND OF IN FIGHTING AND HEADLINES WARNING HIM TO BE AWARE THE I D. S. OF MARCH THE PRIME MINISTER HAD COME TO PRAISE HIS FORMER WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY
IN SPITE OF HAVING TO TAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS ON THE DEFICIT CHILD POVERTY INEQUALITY PENSIONER POVERTY ARE ALL DOWN MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND CONTRIBUTED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT TO THE WORK OF THIS GOVERNMENT AND HE CAN BE PROUD OF WHAT HE ACHIEVED
MISTER CAMERON PAID TRIBUTE TO GEORGE OSBORNE AND SOUGHT TO RALLY HIS M. P.
TODAY WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THIS APPROACH IN FULL BECAUSE WE ARE A MODERN COMPASSIONATE ONE NATION
THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN DIDN'T MENTION IAIN DUNCAN SMITH OR HIS CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT INSTEAD HE FOCUSED ON THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE
IT'S REALLY UP TO THE PRIME MINISTER TO PERSUADE HIS GREAT FRIEND THE CHANCE THE EXCHEQUER TO EITHER COME HERE AND EXPLAIN HOW HE'S GOING TO FILL
THEY SHOULD CONSIDER HIS POSITION THROUGH AND LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO DO
THE LEADER OF THE S.N.P. AT WESTMINSTER ANGUS ROBERTSON SO THE PRIME MINISTER HAD MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT A CIVIL WAR WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT
DOES THE PRIME MINISTER UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE WATCHING THE ONGOING FOLLOWED IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ARE TOTALLY
TO FIND THAT MORE TIME IS SPENT TALKING ABOUT THE JOBS OF TORY MINISTERS RATHER THAN ME
THE TONE OF THE OPPOSITION QUESTIONS WAS HOSTILE BUT MY CAMERON DIDN'T COME UNDER ATTACK FROM HIS OWN SIDE THE NEW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB WAS IN HIS PLACE ON THE GOVERNMENT FRONT BENCH CLUTCHING A RED GOVERNMENT FOLDER HE TOO HAD A STATEMENT TO MAKE AFTER SPENDING THE WEEKEND DISCUSSING WELFARE CHANGES WITH DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE
WE HAVE NO FURTHER PLANS TO MAKE WELFARE SAVINGS BEYOND THE VERY SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS LEGISLATED FOR BY PARLIAMENT TWO WEEKS AGO WHICH WE WILL NOW FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTING
AFTER THE TRADITIONAL PLEASANTRIES WHICH COMPANY A MINISTER'S DEBUT AT THE DESPATCH BOX HAD BEEN OBSERVED THE SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY OWEN SMITH COMPLAINED THAT DISABLED PEOPLE HAD BEEN TARGETED DELIBERATELY
HOWEVER ENTERTAINING MISTER SPEAKER HE'S BEEN WATCHING THIS TORY CIVIL WAR OVER THE WEEKEND WHAT REALLY MATTERS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED
I WAS IN DISABLED PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRING LINE OF THE PRIME MINISTERS
AND THE ARGUMENTS WILL CONTINUE LATER TODAY WHEN THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE SPEAKS DURING THE COMMONS DEBATE ON LAST WEEK'S STATEMENT BEFORE M.P.S VOTE ON THE BUDGET
SEAN CURRAN REPORTING AND THERE'S MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT ON ONE NINE EIGHT LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT THE TIME'S COMING UP TO TEN TO SEVEN SEXTING HAS SKYROCKETED BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S REFUSING TO PROTECT THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM IT THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT LABOUR IS SAYING THEY'VE USED FREEDOM OF INFORMATION TO GET HOLD OF FIGURES THAT SHOW THE POLICE ARE DEALING WITH TEN TIMES AS MANY CASES AS THEY DID ONLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WILL PAUL SENT HIS DEPUTY SHARED DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT NORFOLK CONSTABULARY HE'S ALSO THE HEAD
ALL THE LEAD OFFICER ON CHILD PROTECTION FOR THE NATIONAL POLICE USE COUNSEL GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AN AWFUL LOT OF IT GOING ON IT IS IT IS IT A CRIMINAL OFFENCE HAVE BEEN QUITE CLEAR ABOUT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF AWFUL LOT OF IT GOING ON IT IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE TO EXCHANGE INDECENT IMAGES OF CHILDREN AND IT HAS BEEN AN OFFENCE TO DO THAT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HOW ISSUE IS
THAT SURF THAT OFFENCE CAME INTO LAW AT A TIME BEFORE SMARTPHONES AND BEFORE THEIR FOOD READY EXCHANGE OF IMAGES BY CHILDREN SODA LORD THE SAINT DUPREE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A CHILD SHARING AN IMAGE WITH A CHILD AND AN ADULT HAVING AN OFFENDER WITH A CHILD SO YES IT'S AN OFFENCE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO STATE THAT THE POLICE WILL TAKE A PROPORTIONATE RESPONSE TO ANY REPORTS THAT THEY RECEIVE AVAIS AVAIS CHILD SENDING AN INDECENT IMAGE OF THEMSELVES
AND IN THE MAJORITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD NOT RESULT IN ANY FORM OF CRIMINAL ACTION AGAINST THE CHILD RIGHT SO TO BE QUITE CLEAR IF AN ADULT SENT ONE OF THESE IMAGES TO A CHILD YOU'D HAVE NO HESITATION THAT WOULD BE AN OFFENCE AND YOU DO YOUR BEST TO SEE HIM IN COURT YEAH THAT WOULD BE REALLY SERIOUS CONCERN FOR US AND WE FULLY INVESTIGATED YES EXACTLY SO IF CHILDREN DO IT WHAT DO YOU DO JUST GOING TO HAVE A WORD WITH THEM OR WHAT
OUR PRIMARY CAN THIS SUMMER COMPLAINS THAT HE'S COURSE WELL OF COURSE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT DESPITE THE FIGURES WHICH YOU REPORT ON TODAY THIS IS A SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER REPORTED ACT WE KNOW THAT FROM FROM A STUDY EVEN BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE N.S.P.C.C. FOUND AT SIX OUT OF TEN CHILDREN REPORTED I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SEND A SEXUALISED IMAGE OF THEMSELVES TO SOMEBODY ELSE
SO WHAT WE GETS REPORTED TO THE POLICE IS ONLY A FRACTION OF OF OF THE SIXTEEN TO ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE HAD A TURN THAT'S SURPRISING ISN'T IT YES AND AND WHEN WE DO GET A REPORT A PRIMARY CONCERN WILL ALWAYS BE TO SAFEGUARD THE CHARLWOOD CONCERNED IN THE MAJORITY OF OCCASIONS IT WILL NOT BE PROPORTIONATE FOR THE POLICE TO CARRY OUT AN INVESTIGATION BUT OF COURSE WE DO WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS WHY AN IMAGE MAY WELL HAVE BEEN SHARED WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S BEEN NO COERCION
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PERSON SENDING THE IMAGE IT'S APPROPRIATE I WASN'T OF CONCERN AND TO MAKE SURE OTHER RISKS IT WAS JUST A VERY QUICK FINAL THOUGHT FOR THOUGH IF
PARENT IS A BIT CONCERNED YOU'D BE PERFECTLY HAPPY FOR THEM TO RING THE POLICE AND SAY LOOK YOU WITHOUT MAKING A MASSIVE PERHAPS CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THIS IT IS OF COURSE IT WOULD IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY DO WE WERE ABLE TO HELP HELP HELP THE MANAGE THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT IN TERMS OF WHERE THE IMAGE HAS BEEN SENT THE S. IS IMPORTANT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU THE TIME IS NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A PERFECT CUP OF TEA IT IS SEVENTY YEARS SINCE GEORGE ORWELL CAME OUT WITH HIS ELEVEN STEPS INCLUDING THE TYPE OF CUP THE TEA ITSELF AND OF COURSE THE MILK
ONE SHOULD POUR THE TEA INTO THE CUP FIRST THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL POINTS OF ALL BUT I MAINTAIN THAT BY PUTTING THE TEA IN FIRST ONE CAN MORE PRECISELY REGULATE THE AMOUNT OF MILK THAT GOES IN WHEREAS YOU'RE LIABLE TO PUT TOO MUCH MILK IN IF YOU DO IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
LASTLY TEA SHOULD ALWAYS BE DRUNK WITHOUT SUGAR IT WOULD BE EQUALLY REASONABLE TO PUT IN PEPPER OR SALT
WELL YOU MAY FEEL DIFFERENTLY IT IS A QUESTION OF TASTE AS WELL AS HE'S NOT NOSY NOSE JUST SO IT'S NOT SUGAR CERTAINLY HE FELT STRONGLY ABOUT WE'RE JOINED NOW BY PROFESSOR MARK ME DOWN IT WAS A MATERIAL SCIENTIST WHO'S COME UP WITH HIS OWN FORMULA SEVENTY YEARS AFTER ORWELL AND THERE ARE FEWER THAN ELEVEN
IMPORTANT POINTS OR MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER ABOUT MAKING THE PERFECT CUPPA TEA RICH ARE AND THE FIRST THE BASICALLY THAT THE TYPE OF TEA AND I RECOMMEND LOOSELY TEA THE WARTY IF YOU TAKE A SIP OF THAT WATER BEFORE YOU BOIL IT AND YOU DON'T LIKE THE TASTE OF IT IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE GOOD TEA AND IT'S SURPRISING HOW MANY PEOPLE USED TO MAKE TEA WILLIE CHOICE HE COMES AT THE TOP WELL ACTUALLY IT'S NOT SO TRUE ACTUALLY JOHN BECAUSE ACTUALLY ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING NOW PEOPLE GETTING UP NOW THEY'RE WATER WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN THEIR PIPES ALL NIGHT
AND ACTUALLY SOME OF THE PIPES WILL HAVE REACTED WITH THAT WATER ESPECIALLY AN OLDER SYSTEMS AND THE BEST YOU CAN DO IS LET IT RUN LET IT RUN FOR A MINUTE AND THEN MAKE YOU AND YOU'LL NOTICE A DIFFERENCE YOU CAN ALREADY TELL THAT JOHN HAS STRONG THERE ON VARIOUS AS WE ALL HAVE THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT OR YOU HAVE BUT YOU'VE GOT THE FINAL POINT YOU'VE TEN OR SO THE TEMPERATURE IS SO IMPORTANT THE TEMPERATURE WHICH YOU BREW IT IN THE BREWING PROCESS A PROCESS AND YOU REALLY NEED TO TAKE CARE ABOUT THE TEMPERATURE GET THE TEMPERATURE WRONG
AND YOU WILL NOT GOING TO GET A CUP OF TEA BUT IT'S BOILING POINT ISN'T IT IT'S THERE WHAT ARE THEY WON'T NECESSARILY THAT BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE DON'T USE BOILING WATER IT'S AMAZING FRITTERS ROUND HERE I NOTICE THAT YOU'VE GOT THESE THESE THESE HOT TAPS OFF AND THE WATER COMING OUT OF THOSE IS NOT BOILING ALWAYS THE WATER COMING OUT OF THAT IS IN THE CASE OF THIS BUILDING IS SO THERE YOU ARE NOW
THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PENALTY FOR THOSE WERE YOU DRINKING GREEN TEA THIS MORNING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE TEMPERATURE BETWEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY DEGREES AND IF YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU HAVE A VERY BITTER CUP PEOPLE WHO DRINK GREEN TEA NO THIS THE BLACK TEAS NEED TO BE HOTTER AND THEY CAN BE HOTTER BECAUSE THE PRESS ARE MAKING BLACK TEA ACTUALLY GETS RID OF THE BITTERNESS A LOT OF THESE POLYPHENOLS THAT GIVE YOU THAT BITTERNESS HAVE BEEN MADE INTO THESE INTO THE BODY MAKING
SORT OF SAVOURY FLAVOURS THAT YOU REALLY LIKE ABOUT A KIND OF WARMING COMFORTING CUP TEAM WHICH IS WHY BLACK TEA IN THIS COUNTRY I THINK HE'S SO POPULAR BECAUSE IT'S COLD IT'S RAINY MUCH OF THE TIME AND WHAT YOU WANT FROM YOUR CUPPA TEA A LOT OF THE TIMES WERE SO IT STAYS THIS SENSE OF HOME RIGHT AND YOU YOU CAME INTO THIS WITH TWO CUPS OF TEA AND THESE HAVE BEEN BREWED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY YES I MEAN YOU'VE GOT
A CUPPA TEA MADE WITH A BAG WHICH IS NOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU ASK ME BUT HE'S NOT TOO BAD BECAUSE IT KEEPS THE TEMPERATURE HIGH OFTEN IN THE CUP LIKE YOU'RE DRINKING AND YOU'RE FROM MUG WHICH IS PORCELAIN WHICH IS GREAT GOOD GOOD MATERIAL TO DRINK FROM MUCH BETTER THAN SOAPS TO PLASTIC CUP CARDBOARD CUP I THINK ROY CUP BUT I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT I CAN HIDE HOW DOES THAT HE TASTE WELL FINE IT'S NOT A FULL BODIED CUP OF TEA
YEAH IT'S NOT NOT AS STRONG AS I WOULD NORMALLY HAVE IT IT ALSO HAD MILK IN IT WHICH I WOULD I'M WITH BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE MILK NORMALLY BUT YOU DON'T KNOW I'VE GOT WHAT YOU OFTEN GET THESE WHICH I DEPLORE WHICH IS THEM THE CUP IT WAS GIVEN TO ME HAS STILL GOT THE BAG AND I HONESTLY THINK THAT THIS IS THE WAY THAT IF ANYONE SAYS THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH THAT IN THIS COUNTRY THAT I HOW OFTEN TO YOU ON A TRAIN IN A BUFFET
CARD TO SOMEONE GIVE YOU A CUP OF TEA AND THEY THINK IT'S A PROPER CUP OF TEA AND IT'S BEEN MADE FIRST OF ALL WITH THE WATER FROM THE COFFEE MACHINE BEHIND YOU COFFEE'S FIND IT'S AMAZING MACHINE TO MAKE COFFEE MAKES IT NICE AND STRONG THAT'S IT THAT'S THE WRONG TEMPERATURE THAT WATER'S NINETY TWO DEGREES IN THE COFFEE MACHINE NO I MEANT THE BAG AND THE BAG WILL ACTUALLY BECAUSE BECAUSE THE BAGS IN THERE BECAUSE YOU ADD THE MILK BEFORE ITS BROOD WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS THEY PUT THE BAG IN THE WATER AND THEN THE MILK STRAIGHT IN NOW THE TEMPERATURE'S DOWN TO EIGHTY DEGREES

TASTE YOU'VE GOT NOBODY NO FLAVOUR AND IT'S ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY IT'S ABSOLUTE DISGRACE WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE THIS MORNING WHAT THEY THINK MAKES A PERFECT CUP AND EVEN TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THEIR OWN ENDS AND SEND IT INTO US EMAIL TODAY OF B.

LABOUR HAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF FAILING TO ENSURE CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT THE DANGERS OF SHARING EXPLICIT PHOTOS BY PHONE OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SEXTING LAST YEAR ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED INCIDENTS WERE INVESTIGATED BY POLICE FORCES IN ENGLAND THE SHADOW EDUCATION SECRETARY LUCY POWELL SAYS LABOUR WOULD MAKE UPDATED SEX EDUCATION A COMPULSORY SUBJECT IN ALL STATE SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT ALREADY FUNDS A CAMPAIGN TO TACKLE AWARENESS OF SEXTING IS OUR EDUCATION EDITOR BRANWYN JEFFERIES
MOST SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND TEACH CHILDREN SOMETHING ABOUT SEX RELATIONSHIPS DRUGS AND MONEY BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO INCLUDE IT IN THE TIMETABLE AND NO ONE TELLS THEM EXACTLY WHAT TO TEACH POLICE FORCES IN ENGLAND ARE INVESTIGATING MORE INCIDENTS OF UNDERAGE TEENAGERS RECEIVING OR SENDING EXPLICIT PHOTOS
LUCY PILE THE SHADOW EDUCATION SECRETARY SAYS SOCIAL MEDIA HAS OVERTAKEN GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES HEALTH CHARITIES ENGLAND'S CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AND MANY M.P.S OF ALL ARGUED PERSONAL EDUCATION SHOULD BE COMPULSORY BUT EARLIER THIS YEAR THE GOVERNMENT REJECTED GIVING IT STABBED THREE STATUS IN FAVOUR OF GIVING SCHOOLS INFORMATION TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN LESSONS

THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE CHANCELLOR WILL FACE EM PEAS TODAY TO DEFEND HIS BUDGET AFTER DAYS OF IT AND HIS OWN COMPETENCE AND JUDGEMENT COMING UNDER ATTACK WE ALREADY KNOW THE CHANGES TO DISABILITY PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN SHELVED AND TODAY THE CONSERVATIVES FOR BRITAIN GROUP WHICH IS CAMPAIGNING FOR A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U.
HE'S SETTING OUT WHAT IT THINKS COULD BE IN HER FIRST POST BRICKS IT BUDGET WE'RE JOINED BY JOHN REDWOOD M.P. FORMER WELSH SECRETARY ADVICE FOR A VICE PRESIDENT OF CONSERVATIVES FOR BRITAIN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND YOU'VE WORKED OUT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE TEN BILLION POUNDS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO PLAY WITH IN THIS SCENARIO
YES AS A BRECHT'S IT DIVIDEND AS THE TEN THOUSAND MILLION THE BRITISH TAXPAYERS HAVE TO SEND TO SPEND IN THE RICH COUNTRIES IN THE REST OF EUROPE AS WELL AS THE NEARLY TEN BID IN WE GET BACK SO A GOVERNMENT POST BRECHT'S IT COULD SAY TO ALL THE FARMERS AND UNIVERSITIES AND OTHERS GETTING EUROPEAN MONEY YOU GET ALL THE SAME MONEY THAT YOU USED TO GET FROM EUROPE ONLY WILL PAY IT AND THEN ON TOP WE'VE GOT THIS TEN THOUSAND MILLION WE DON'T GET BACK WHICH WE CAN SPEND ON OUR PRIORITIES SO I THINK WE COULD HAVE
A BUDGET WHICH BANISHED AUSTERITY AND PUT PROSPERITY IN THE FRONT OF IT ALL THAT IT WAS DOING COS WE HAVE ALL THAT EXTRA MONEY TO SPEND A BIT OF FIRST POST BRECHT'S AT BUDGET WOULD ALSO POTENTIALLY BE DEALING WITH WITH A PROFOUND ECONOMIC SHOCK THE C.B.I. HAS HAS SAID THE BRAKES IT COULD BLOW ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUND HOLE IN THE ECONOMY JOHN JOHN LONGWORTH WHO FEELS AS YOU DO ABOUT THE E.U. U. HAS HAS SAID THERE WILL BE SHORT TERM DISRUPTION
I SEEM TO REMEMBER THE C.B.I. WERE THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK US INTO THE EUROPEAN EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM WHICH CAUSED A BIG RECESSION DID ENORMOUS DAMAGE THEY'VE COMPLETELY WRONG ABOUT THAT FORECAST THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE MONEY FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION OF COURSE I'M SURE WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND MONEY FOR THE C.P.I. IF THEY STARTED HAVING SENSE REFUSAL LET'S MENTORS ARE JOHN LONGWORTH IS ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE DEBATE AS YOU ARE AND HE HAS SAID CLEARLY THERE WILL BE A SHORT TERM DISRUPTION SO THIS POST BRICKS AT SCENARIO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WOOD
HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT WITH WITH SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT NEEDS EXTRA MONEY I THINK WE'VE GOT TEN THOUSAND MILLION OF OUR MONEY TO SPEND ON OUR PRIORITIES SO WE CAN SPEND MORE ON HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE AND NOT NEED THOSE DISABILITY CUTS MATCH SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHOSE JOBS TONIGHT HAVE BEEN DEPEND NEVER THEY WON'T BE DRAWN TO LICENCE THIS IS A COMPLETE NONSENSE RIDICULOUS SCARE THAT'S BEING PUT AROUND
THE THE REST OF EUROPEAN UNION SELLS US MUCH MORE THAN WE SELL THEM THEY MADE IT VERY CLEAR THEY WANT TO CARRY ON TRADING WITH US OUR TRADE IS NOT AT RISK AND OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS WOULD OF COURSE IMPROVE IMMEDIATELY WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION ONCE WE STOP PAYING THE CONTRIBUTIONS THIS WEEK WE HAVE A TWELVE THOUSAND MILLION POUNDS HIT ON OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS EVERY YEAR TO PAY ALL THOSE MONIES TO EUROPE WHICH WE WOULDN'T NEED TO PAY WHEN WE'VE LEFT SO OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS WOULD BE STRONGER
SO I THINK THE MARKETS WOULD SOON REALISE THAT THAT WAS GOOD NEWS NOT BAD NEWS WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE OF THE CURRENT POSITION THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS INDIAN DAYS AFTER THEIR BUDGET WILL SEE THE CHANCELLOR GOING TO THE COMMONS TODAY DO YOU THINK THAT
THE RESIGNATION OF OF IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WAS WAS PRIMARILY ABOUT WELFARE OR WAS IT ABOUT THE E.U. VOTE IT'S ENTIRELY ABOUT WELFARE OR MISTER DUNCAN SMITH HE'S AN HONEST MAN THE LETTER WAS ALL ABOUT WELFARE IF YOU'VE BEEN RESIGNING OVER EUROPE HE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN LETTER ABOUT EUROPE BECAUSE HE'D HAVE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE EUROPEAN ISSUE SO WE HAD A WEEKEND TALKING ABOUT THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER TO US ON THIS REFERENDUM RATHER THAN HAVING A WEEKEND TALKING ABOUT DIVISIONS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT
AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ON WELFARE IT WAS ENTIRELY ABOUT WELFARE AND IT'S COMPLETE NONSENSE OF PEOPLE PUTTING AROUND THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR IT WOULD IT HAVE HAPPENED WERE IT NOT FOR THE E.U. YOU VOTE COMING UP THAT THAT HE'S CREATED THAT THE CLIMATE WHERE DIVISIONS ON ON ONE THING AND MAKE YOU FEEL MORE STRONGLY ABOUT DIVISIONS ON ANOTHER JUST ACROSS IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE EUROPEAN VOTE BECAUSE IT WAS IF YOU REMEMBER THE REASON HE RESIGNED AS THEY HAVE BEEN A SERIES OF CUTS MADE OVER THE YEARS THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HE'D ACCEPTED IN THE SPIRIT OF COMPROMISES YOU HAVE TO DO
IN A GOVERNMENT AND THEN THEY WERE CHANGED WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM AND PEOPLE STARTED BRIEFING THAT THEY WERE HIS FAULT WHEN THEY HAD BEEN SUGGESTED BY OTHERS AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST TOO MUCH AND WHERE HAS WHAT HE HAS DONE LEFT THE POSITION OF THE CHANCELLOR AND IN PARTICULAR AND HIS AUTHORITY
THE CHANCELLOR REMAINS AND THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT OFFICE IN THE LAND AND WE ALL WISH HIM WELL AND HE NEEDS TO REBUILD HIS BUDGET VERY QUICKLY AS I'M SURE HE WILL HE CAN SET THAT OUT TODAY IN THE HOUSE WHEN HE RESPONDS TO THE BUDGET DEBATE AND I'M PERSONALLY VERY PLEASED THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH THE
P.I.P. CHANGES THEY WERE NOT SOMETHING I MANY OTHER COLLEAGUES LIKE THE LOOK OF IF WE HAD A POST BRECHT'S IT BUDGET WOULD BE ACTUALLY NO NEED FOR THIS KIND OF THING COS WE'D HAVE ALL THAT EXTRA MONEY WHICH BRITISH TAXPAYERS HAVE TO PAY IN WHICH IT HAS TO BE SPENT ON THE CONTINENT OR NOT HERE WE DOSE ABOUT TO CHOOSE HER OWN TAXES BECAUSE OF COURSE ONE OF THE OTHER ROWS ABOUT THE BUDGET
IS THE NEED TO PUT V.A.T. UP ON ALL THOSE GREEN MATERIAL SAYS GREEN PRODUCTS BECAUSE THE COMMISSION TOOK US TO COURT AND TOLD US WE HAVE TO CHARGE MORE TAX ON THINGS THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE ACTIVELY PROMOTED AND FORTUNATELY PARLIAMENT IS NOW SAYING TO THE GOVERNOR YOU CANNOT DO THIS BUT EUROPE STILL HASN'T CHANGED THE LAW TO ALLOW US TO KEEP THE THE V.A.T. DOWN ON ALL THOSE GREEN PRODUCTS YOU SAID YOU WISHED THE CHANCELLOR WELL WHAT WOULD HE MAKE A GOOD LEADER
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CHANGE LEADERS WE ARE FIGHTING A VERY IMPORTANT REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WE HAVE A LEADER WHO IS THE PRIME MINISTER WHO HAS FOUGHT OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN THE MEDIA SHOULD REALLY CONCENTRATE ON THE RAILS WE ARE HAVING WE'RE HAVING A REALLY GOOD NATIONAL DEBATE OVER WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR LEAVE IT'S FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL THESE OTHER TITTLE TATTLE THINGS YOU KEEP RAISING OR MANY OF US ARE PASSIONATE TO GET OUR DEMOCRACY BACK GET OUR FREEDOM BACK GET BACK OUR RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN LAWS GET BACK THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE OUR OWN TAXES TO SPEND OUR OWN MONEY
AND SOME PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE SEEM TO THINK THAT BRITAIN DOESN'T HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE ITS OWN TAXES AND SPEND ITS OWN MONEY BUT WE'RE GOING TO SHOW THEM THAT WE DO AND I THINK MOST BRITISH PEOPLE WILL BE WITH US IN WANTING THEIR FREEDOM AND THEIR DEMOCRACY BACK JOHN REDWOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN FOR MANY MONTHS NOW BATTLE'S BEEN RAGING BETWEEN THE MIGHTY APPLE CORPORATION AND THE F.B.I. OVER ENCRYPTED DATA ON AND I FILM THE F.B.I. WHAT ARE YOUSE DATA IN A CASE INVOLVING A MAN AND WHO EXCUSE ME AND HIS WIFE WHO MURDERED FOURTEEN PEOPLE IN SAN BERNARDINO CALIFORNIA BUT APPLE AS REFUSED TO UNLOCK THE BONE ON THE BASIS THAT IT WOULD SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
THERE WAS YET ANOTHER HEARING SET FOR TODAY BUT NOW IT'S BEEN POSTPONED BECAUSE THE F.B.I. HAS FOUND SOMEONE AN OUTSIDE PARTY AS THEY PUT IT APPARENTLY KNOWS HOW TO BREAK INTO THE PHONE I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT TO AN ENCRYPTION EXPERT CHARLIE MILLER USED TO WORK FOR AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY I SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT THIS WAS BAD NEWS FOR APPLE BUT GOOD NEWS FOR THE F.B.I.
I SAW THESE PRY PRETTY GOOD NEWS FOR OUR APPLE NOW AND WON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR AVERAGE SYSTEM THEY WON'T HAVE TO WRITE ANY GOOD FOR THE EYES I THINK THEY'RE SORT OF OFF THE HOOK ON THE OTHER HAND IT MEANS THAT THEIR SYSTEMS ARE NOT IMPREGNABLE
THAT'S TRUE BUT I THINK WE ONLY KNEW THAT SO THERE'S NEW VIRAL IS DISCOVERING HOURS EVERY DAY IF WE HAVE TO RELY ON THE F.B.I. FINE HE'S VULNERABLE IS ANNEXED IN THEM I THINK WE'RE IN A BETTER PLACE THAN HAVING THE I MAKE APPLE YOU KNOW DO THAT FOR THEM
SO WHAT WAS ALL THE FUSS ABOUT I THINK THE PROBLEM IS MAKING APPLE DO SOMETHING TO PURPOSELY WEAKEN THEIR SECURITY SO APPLE NEXT
BIG EFFORT AS AS A LOWER TECH HOMBRES DUE TO ENFORCE SECURITY IN THE STRONGEST WAY PAST ALL THE PROTECTOR USERS AND HAPPY YEAH I WAS TRYING TO GET AN APPLE TO I'M PURPOSELY WEAKEN THAT UM WHAT'S HAPPENED INSTEAD IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS AT THE F.B.I. HAS SOMEHOW FOUND A WAY IN TO SOMEHOW CIRCUM SECURITY WITHOUT APPLES HOW WITCHES
BUMMER THAT THEY CAN DO THEIR BROTHER AND THE GOOD SAY APPLE CAN STILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP TO SECURE THEIR THEIR AVARICE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHEN THEY GET MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE F.B.I. TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE APPLE'S CUSTOMERS
THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT WELL SAY WELL IF THE F.B.I. CAN FIND AN EXPERT TO TO BREAK INTO THEIR SYSTEMS IN OTHER WORDS OF THE GOOD GUYS CAN FIND A WAY TO BREAK INTO THEIR SYSTEM SO GONE THE BAD GUYS AND THAT HASN'T CHANGED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN I'VE BEEN FAVOURABLE IS NARROWEST FOR SINCE TWO THOUSAND SALMON SO THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO WANT TO BILLY'S BUT IT'S GOOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
BAD GUYS OR WHOEVER PHINEAS VIBE BOYS BECAUSE THAT'S HARD IT'S HARD WORK TO EXPLOITS AND GET AROUND THE SECURITY IT GIVES APPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD EVEN MORE SECURE SYSTEMS AND MAKE THAT EVEN HARDER IN THE FUTURE SO NO ONE THINKS IT'S PERFECT IT'S GOOD I WAS DEVICES ARE VERY SECURE BUT I MEAN IT'S GOING TO GIVE APPLE THE ABBOTS YOU NEED TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT AND EVEN HARDER AND HARDER IN THE FUTURE AND THERE'S NO YOU KNOW MAYBE THE F.B.I. HAS ALREADY LED TODAY THEY HAVE SOME WAY ROUND IT BUT MAYBE VERY SOON
SOME LIKE MIA APPLE THEMSELVES MIGHT FIND THE SPORE AND SIX IT WILL BE LIKE THAT ONCE AGAIN I SAID I SUPPOSE THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PERFECT SECURITY
THAT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE NO ONE YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO CLAIMS A VERY SCARY IS CERTAINLY LYING WHERE HUMAN BEANS WE MAKE MISTAKES NO ONE KNOWS THE EARLY ART AS THAT I LIKE ME I TRY TO DO IS MAKE IT VERY HARD TO BREAK INTO PRODUCTS AND HOPEFULLY THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE DO WE KNOW WHO IT WAS WHO MANAGED TO CRACK THIS ONE
NOW NO NO ONE KNOWS AS FAR AS I KNOW THE THING IS INTERESTING AS IF IT'S TRUE THAT THE F.B.I. CAN DO IT YESTERDAY BUT THEY CAN DO IT TODAY IT'S UNLIKELY THAT FROM SOMEBODY BECAUSE
FINDING A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THE SECURITY I GUESS SO I MUST HAVE A VERY SECURE IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO OVERNIGHT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO A WEEK SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOMEONE IS VERY TALENTED QUITE A BIT OF TIME TO DO THIS SO I DON'T KNOW WHO HELPED THEM NOW FOR HIS MAGGOTS CHARLIE MILLER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN MEASURES ARE BEING SUGGESTED TO GET MORE WOMEN TO THE TOP OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR ADAM HAS MORE ON THAT IN THE BUSINESS NEWS THAT ENTRY MICHELLE THANK YOU THE GUARDIAN REVIEW IS OUT THIS MORNING LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF UNEQUAL GENDER REPRESENTATIONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES IT'S FOUND THAT IN FINANCIAL SERVICES IN THE U.K. FEMALE REPRESENTATION IS ABOUT TWENTY THREE PER CENT ON BOUGHT ONLY FOURTEEN PERCENT ON EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AS WAR JANE I'M GARDENER IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF VIRGIN MONEY AND LEAD THIS REVIEW THAT IS A
HIT A FOUR FIGURE ISN'T IT I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I WAS ASKED TO TAKE ON THIS REVIEW TO FIND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ARE SO MUCH WORSE THAN OTHER INDUSTRIES THERE'S NO REASON FOR THAT WE NEED TO BREAK IT DOWN FINANCIAL SERVICES ARE OBVIOUSLY A LYNCHPIN OF THE ECONOMY AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN GET GENDER BALANCE RIGHT THE MORE ECONOMIC BENEFIT WILL BE DRIVEN MEAN IT'S BEEN PROVEN BEYOND DOUBT THAT HAVING A BALANCED LEADERSHIP TEAM
PROVIDES A BETTER FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR ORGANISATION SO THERE'S A SORT OF MORAL FAIRNESS AND ECONOMIC POINT TO GETTING THIS RIGHT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT HIM WELL I REPORT SUGGESTS THREE THINGS IT SAYS EVERY ORGANISATION SHOULD REALLY MAKE THIS ISSUE AS CENTRAL TO THEIR BUSINESS CASES THEIR FINANCIAL TARGETS HAVE A STRATEGY DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE SET YOURSELF SOME TARGETS APPOINT AN EXECUTIVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
PUBLISHED THE YOUR PROGRESS AGAINST THOSE TARGETS AND THEN REWARD YOUR EXECUTIVES FOR ACHIEVING THEM NOW IT'S INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT THAT'S A CHALLENGING THING TO DO PARTICULARLY TYING REMUNERATION TO OUTCOMES BUT IN FINANCIAL SERVICES THAT'S WHAT WE DO TO ACHIEVE FINANCIAL RESULTS YOU KNOW WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS DONE WHAT GETS REMUNERATED DRIVES BEHAVIOUR SO LET'S DO IT FOR THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE LOTS OF WELL MEANING A COMMON TO BE MADE OVER THE YEARS ABOUT THIS JENNA GUARDIAN NOTHING REALLY HAS HAPPENED THEN YOU NEED A BIG STICK TO FORCE FIRMS TO FOLLOW RULES
MY OWN VIEW ON THAT IS THAT OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF REALLY GOOD REPORTS THAT HAVE LOOKED AT INDIVIDUAL ISSUES BUT EVERY ORGANISATIONS DIFFERENT ALL CULTURES ARE DIFFERENT ALL WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ORGANISATIONS TRAIN THEIR LEADERSHIP AND THEIR MANAGES TO WORK OUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THEIR ORGANISATION AND THEIR WOMEN AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SAYING
PUT YOUR OWN STRATEGY THERE THAT MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT ONE AND DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE FOR YOU AND MAKE SURE YOU DELIVER IT THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT A PUT YOU ONE SAYS THAT WOMEN TOO WELL AND THEN
START FAMILIES ANOTHER SCHOOL SAYS THAT THERE IS JUST TERRIBLE SEXISM WITHIN FINANCIAL SERVICES DO YOU BUY EITHER OF THOSE I DON'T BUY EITHER OF THOSE SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT OF COURSE WOMEN LEAVE ALL SORTS OF ORGANISATIONS TO START FAMILIES BUT NO MORE SO IN FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ANYWHERE ELSE I DISCOUNT THAT IS IRRELEVANT TO THIS PARTICULAR DEBATE
I DON'T THINK THAT FINANCIAL SERVICES IS RIFE WITH SEXISM BUT WHAT I DO THINK IS THAT THE CULTURE OF ORGANISATIONS A FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANISATIONS IS IF YOU LIKE VERY MALE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN WIN AT ALL COSTS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN BE PRESENT TO BE HERE BE SEEN TO BE WORKING ALL THE HOURS THAT GOD
AND I THINK IF WE CAN BUILD A MORE FLEXIBLE CULTURE IN A MORE INCLUSIVE CULTURE FOR MEN AND FOR WOMEN THIS ISN'T ME TRYING TO BE VERY FEMINIST ABOUT IT SAYING ORGANISATIONS ARE BEST WITH MEN AND WOMEN WORKING TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE GREAT RESULT JOHN UNGUARDED CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF VIRGIN MONEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE JUST HAD IN THE PAST FROM IT'S THE REGULATOR OFCOM HAS PUT FORWARD NEW RULES TO IMPROVE B.T.'S PERFORMANCE IN INSTALLING AND REPAIRING BROADBAND LINES FOR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS ALSO TOLD B.T. TO CUT THEIR PRICES B.T. CHARGES FOR THOSE LIGHTS
THANKS ADAM ALSO IN THAT LAST FEW MINUTES WE'VE JUST HEARD TWO EXPLOSIONS HAVE BEEN HEARD AT THE AIRPORT IN BRUSSELS AND THAT SMOKE IS RISING FROM ONE OF THE BUILDINGS WE DON'T YET KNOW WHAT TERM CAUSED THE EXPLOSIONS BUT WE ARE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THIS AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO BRING YOU MORE ON IT THE SIMS
TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS COUNTRY HAS CLOSE TIES TO SAUDI ARABIA A DEFENCE INDUSTRY RELIES HEAVILY ON IT ON WHAT WE SELL THEM BUT THERE'S A NEW DOCUMENTARY ON I.T.V. TONIGHT SAUDI ARABIA UNCOVERED EXPOSURE THAT SUGGESTS THOSE TIES ARE TOO CLOSE GIVEN THE REPRESSIVE NATURE OF THE SAUDI REGIME HERE'S A CLIP FROM THE PROGRAMME NOW WHERE IN SAUDI ARABIA OR FILMING WE DO IS FOR
COVER STORY IS THAT WE'RE HERE FOR A BUSINESS CONFERENCE ON THE WAY WE VISIT ONE OF SAUDI ARABIA'S MOST NOTORIOUS LAND
KNOWN AS CHOP CHOP SQUARE IT'S A SCENE OF MANY OF SAUDI ARABIA'S PUBLIC PUNISHMENT AND THERE'S A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE
I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY JAMES JONES WHO'S THE PRODUCER OF THE DOCUMENTARY AND JAMES A LOT OF IT IS IN FACT ALL OF IT I SUPPOSE IS UNDERCOVER STUFF MOST OF IT IS UNDERCOVER WE WOULD IT'S A COMBINATION OF OUR OWN TRIP PROBABLY SET UP A FAKE COMPANY TO GET IN YOU CAN'T GET INTO SAUDI ARABIA AS A TOURIST AND JOURNALISTS OPERATE WITH MIND
BUT ALSO WE WORKED WITH THE KIND OF NET UNDERGROUND NETWORK OF SAUDIS IT'LL HAVE NETWORKS OF ACTIVISTS WHO WANT TO SHOW THE WORLD THE REALITY OF LIFE IN SAUDI ARABIA AND WHAT DID YOU FIND THAT WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW
SO WE SAW POVERTY WHICH IS A KIND OF CLOSELY HELD SECRET OBVIOUSLY SAUDI ARABIA IS THE LARGEST OIL EXPORTER IN THE WORLD THERE WERE THE SIDE OF SALLY THAT WE SEE IS KIND OF LUXURY SHOPPING MALLS AND YOU KNOW WHAT A FAMILY WITH ENORMOUS WEALTH WE FOUND WITH HUNDREDS OF WOMEN BEGGING ON THE STREET THE OIL CRASH OF HIP ECONOMY HARD
ALMOST A QUARTER OF SAUDIS AND ARE LIVING IN POVERTY WHICH IS THIS KIND OF DIRTY SECRET INSIDE A BIT IF YOU FILM POVERTY AND POST IT ONLINE YOU GO TO PRISON SO IT WAS AN INCREDIBLY BRAVE THING FOR THESE YOUNG ACTIVIST TO DO TO FILM THE STUFF USING AN UNDERCOVER CAMERA THAT WE GAVE THEM HAVE TO MEET THEM OUTSIDE SAUDI GIVEN THIS CAMERA TRAINING IN HOW TO USE IT
THEN THEY WENT BACK IN AND THEN SMUGGLED THE FITTED OUT TO US BUT WE WE KNOW ABOUT FLOGGINGS WE KNOW ABOUT BEHEADINGS WHAT DID YOU FIND IN THAT AREA
THAT WOULD HAVE SURPRISED THE WOOL SURPRISE US WELL I THINK THE CRUCIAL THING I'VE MADE FILMS OR ALL AROUND THE WORLD WE DID HAVE A SIMILAR PROJECT IN NORTH KOREA I THINK THE CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE WITH THIS IS THAT THEY ARE AN ALLY AND SO IT'S NOT ONLY THAT THERE ARE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES THAT IF YOU CRITICISE THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT
PRISON BLAST BUT POTENTIALLY EVEN EXECUTED THE POINT IS THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAD SUCH CLOSE TIES WITH THIS COUNTRY SO THE MOMA CRYSTALLISED IT FOR ME WAS NOT ONLY RACE BADAWI YOUNG BLOGGER WHO WAS FLOGGED AND JAMIE TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR
WRITING AN OPINION ON LINE BUT ACTUALLY THAT SUMMER WHEN WE STARTED TO MAKE THIS PROGRAMME A FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER STOOD UP AND SAID YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT A MAJORITY OF SAUDI SUPPORT THIS PUNISHMENT THEY WOULDN'T GET A FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER SAYING A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN RATTUS SUPPORT
HE'S GOING TO POP OUT PUNISHMENT SO THERE WAS A KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH EXAMINING AND THE PROGRAMME IS ON THERE

JAMES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND COFFEES HERE WITH THE SPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING A FEW HOURS AGO RAYMOND MAW THEY SEE TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR OF INDIAN WELLS STEPPED DOWN FROM BOTH OF THOSE ROLES FOLLOWING HIS COMMENTS THAT THE WOMEN'S GAME RIDES ON THE COAT TAILS OF THE MEN'S

N.H.S. ENGLAND IS EXPANDING A PROGRAMME WHICH AIMS TO STOP THOUSANDS OF ADULTS FROM DEVELOPING TYPE TWO DIABETES ARE LARGELY PREVENTABLE DISEASE IT'S ALREADY BEEN TRIED IN SEVEN AREAS AND WILL NOW BE EXPANDED TO TAKE IN TWENTY SEVEN COVERING HALF OF ENGLAND
TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT SIX MONTHS AGO ENGLISH RUGBY WAS IN THE DARKEST PIT OF DESPAIR KNOCKED OUT OF THE WORLD CUP IN THE FIRST ROUND NOW IT'S RIDING WINNERS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTEEN YEARS OF THE GRAND SLAM AND MANY PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE EDDIE JONES TO THANK FOR THAT HE'S RATHER DOUR AUSTRALIAN IT WAS BROUGHT IN TO TAKE OVER AS HEAD COACH WHEN STUART LANCASTER RESIGNED AND IT SAID OF HIM THAT HE OPERATES
SORT OF SIEGE MENTALITY IT WAS FORMER COACH SIR CLIVE WOODWARD WHO SAID ENGLAND ARE HATED BY ALL THE OTHERS AND THAT EXPLAINS THE SIEGE MENTALITY WELL MAYBE I'VE BEEN TALKING TO EDDIE JONES I ASKED HIM IF THAT'S TRUE
I THINK THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES IS VERY INTENSE IN THERE OBVIOUSLY ENGLAND BEING THE BIGGEST COUNTRY PROBABLY ENDURES A LOT OF
IVORY FROM THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE ADS TO GOOD SPORTING CONTESTS SO YOU DON'T ALL DO YOU POSITIVELY ENCOURAGE THIS SORT OF SIEGE MENTALITY
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HE TOLD HIM HE HAD TO BE ENCOURAGING THE LADS TOOK TO GET THEM FIRED UP BECAUSE THERE IS THIS HATRED AGAINST THEM AND THEY'VE GOT TO PROVE THAT THE WORLD AND THAT SORT OF SIEGE MENTALITY I MEAN I'VE NEVER SPOKEN THE PLAYERS ABOUT THAT WE SPEAK A BEAR WHILE WE NEED TO DO TO WIN GAMES OR I'D BE IN AND THE WINDOWS AROUND WE NEED TO BE PHYSICALLY AGGRESSIVE YOU NEED TO BE SMART
THINGS WE PRACTISE THINGS WE WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU'RE AS YOU WILL KNOW YOUR PREDECESSOR AS TO LANCASTER WAS TO KNOW THAT HE WANTED TO BE LOVED DO YOU KIND OF SET OUT TO BE THE HARD MAN
I JUST CAME DOWN ON THE COUCH AND YOU GET UNDERSTAND HIS ATTORNEYS FINE CARRIAGE FOR ENGLAND ARE IN THE POSITION WE'RE IN NOW AND HE'S GOING TO LIKE ME THAT'S THE REALITY OF IT IF WE WIN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY TO GARY BLADES BECAUSE
THE STRANDS INVOLVED IF WE LIZ I'LL BE THE FATHER YEAH I ACCEPT THAT I GET ON WITH I'M NOT HERE TO KEEP EVERYONE HAPPY ON THE EITHER PRODUCER GOOD ENGLAND RUGBY TEAM THAT ENCOURAGES KIDS TO PLAY RUGBY NO IT'S DID YOU SOUND AS IF YOU KNOW REALLY MIND WHETHER YOU'RE LIKED OR NOT NOW I THINK HE'S A CATCHING THAT THEY HAVE TO BE LIKE THE NIGHT YOU NEED TO BE RESPECTED ME IF YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB PROPERLY YOU'LL BE RESPECTED
WHAT ABOUT THE COACHING STYLE THAT YOU BRING TO THE GAME I MEAN I'M TEMPTED TO SAY WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE AN AUSTRALIAN THAT IT'S NOT A PERSONAL REMARK I COULD BECAUSE IT WAS YOU THINKING OF WILD COME ON BUT THE FACT IS THAT THE BEST THAT SOME OF THE BEST COACHES WE'VE HAD TO HAVE BEEN AUSTRALIAN WHAT DO YOU DO THAT ENGLISH COACHES DON'T DO ONE OF THE EASIEST THINGS FOR US IS TO COME HERE AND LOOK AT THINGS WITHOUT HAVING ANY
PREVIOUS MISS CONCEPTIONS OF OF WHAT
IT WAS RIGHT AND WHAT WAS WRONG AND JUST TO LOOK AT THE PLAYERS AND SAY RIGHT THIS CLAY CAN ONLY DO THIS AND I THINK THAT HAPPENS A LITTLE BIDDY ENGLAND I THINK WE'VE GOT A WIDER VIEW OF WHERE THE PLAYER CAN GO
WHAT ABOUT THE GAME ITSELF IT IS A TRANSFORMED FROM WHAT IT WAS CERTAINLY ONE WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE RULE CHANGES OBVIOUSLY AND IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE IN THESE TWO THINGS ARE LINKED I SUPPOSE IN A WAY AREN'T THEY THE THE PLAYERS ARE SO MUCH BIGGER AND STRONGER AND FASTER WHEN YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF SIXTEEN STONE MEN RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER AT VERY VERY HIGH SPEED THE RISKS ARE MUCH GREATER THAT THE GAME HAS CHANGED HASN'T IT
THE GAME'S CHANGED ENORMOUSLY YOU KNOW THE LEVEL OF PHYSICAL PREPARATION FOR THE GAME IT'S CHANGED ENORMOUSLY IT'S AGAIN WHO IS SKILLED IN SOME WAYS OVER THE LAST
PERIOD HAS BEING THE MINISTER I THINK THE NEXT STEP FOR ME IS TO GET THAT SCHOOL BACK IN THE GAME OH WE WHAT TURNS I THINK THE ATTACKING SKILLS IN RUGBY OVER THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS HASN'T BEEN FANTASTIC I THINK SIDES HAVE TENDED TO CONCENTRATE ON
ON THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS IN THE FENCES ASPECTS I THINK THE NEXT CHAMPION RUGBY OR BE A SURGING ATTACKING SKILLS AND THEY CAN ONLY BE GOOD FOR THE GANG WHAT ABOUT YOUNGSTERS YOU'LL KNOW THAT THERE IS A GROWING MOVEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY TO STOP CHILDREN RUGBY PLAYING BOYS OR GIRLS NO COURSE TACKLING EACH OTHER BEFORE THEY GO TO SECONDARY SCHOOL ANOTHER WAS NON CONTACT RUGBY FOR THE FIRST YEARS RIGHT UP UNTIL THEY GO TO SECONDARY SCHOOL WHAT D'YOU THINK OF THAT BEING AN EX P.E. TEACHER
ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT SPORT IS THAT HE CAN PICK ANY SPORT YOU WANNA PLAY IF YOU DON'T DO YOU HAVE PHYSICALLY TOUGH GAME YOU CAN PLAY VOLLEYBALL THAT'S A GREAT THING A BAD SPORT IN GENERAL KIDS HAVE AN OPTION THE PLAY ANY SPORT THEY WANT TO AND I THINK THAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE CASE YOU WOULDN'T PUT AN AGE LIMIT ON WHEN THEY CAN PLAY CONTACT RUGBY
LOOK YOU KNOW I THINK THAT VARIES ON THE SKILL OF THE PLAYERS IF THE PLAYERS ARE SKILLED ENOUGH TO TACKLE HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED THE TACKLE AND I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN OR TWELVE YEAH PLAYERS ARE READY TO PLAY TACKLE RUGBY ELEVEN OR TWELVE AND BEFORE THAT
I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT WE WE LOOK AFTER PLAYERS A BIT MORE YEAH THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTE RULE I THINK IF PLAYERS ARE EDUCATED ENOUGH THEY CAN DE TACKLE RUGBY AT AN EARLIER AGE I CERTAINLY PLAYING TAG AROUND ME AT THE AGE OF FIVE
DID YOU REALLY DID YOU GET IT A LOT BUT NEVER GOT HER IN MY LIFE AND I WAS A LITTLE HALF JAPANESE BOY PLAYING IS MUCH BIGGER SO YEAH THERE WASN'T A PROBLEM FOR ME SO YOU'D LEAVE IT PRETTY MUCH AS IT IS THEN I DO WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER CHANGE WHICH IS INSTEAD OF HAVING KIDS PLAYING AGAINST EACH OTHER ACCORDING THE THE YEAR THEIR SCHOOL YEAR YOU WILL WILL HAVE THEM PLAYING GAMES YOU'VE GOT A GOOD SIZE AND WEIGHT
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT ARE NOW IN NEW ZEALAND THEY'VE GONE DOWN THAT LINE WHERE THEY'VE GOT MESSY DISTINCTION BETWEEN POLYNESIAN KIDS IN THERE AND ANGLO SAXON KIDS BECAUSE UPON THE ASIAN KIDS TIN THE MATURE EARLIER SO THEY HAVE DECIDED TO SEPARATE THE TEAMS NOT BYE BYE AGE BUT BY SIZE AND I THINK
IF YOU'RE SEEN AS MESSY DISCREPANCIES INSIDE IN A WAY IT'S A GOOD WAY TO GO RIGHT THE FUTURE FOR YOU THEN YOU'VE PULLED IT OFF THIS TIME YOU'VE GOT TO PUT IT UP NEXT TIME ON THEN A FEW YEARS TIME THE WORLD CUP ARE YOU STILL GOING TO BE AROUND FOR THAT DEFINITELY WILL YOU AS A CATCH YOU DON'T MAKE THOSE DECISIONS BE BLUBBING A RADIO AND I AS IF YOU DON'T GET THE RIDING EASY DAD STAY IN THE JOB WITH THE SAME AS A KATIE THERE WE CAN WIN GAMES OR I'D RUGBY THEN STAY IN THE JOB SAY YOU AND I'VE GOT THE SAME PHILOSOPHY
EDDIE JONES THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED THANKS VERY MUCH IS THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT JUST A FEW MORE DETAILS WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM BRUSSELS AND THOSE EXPLOSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT BRUSSELS AIRPORT IT HAPPENED IN THE DEPARTURE HALL AND THERE'S BEEN SOME VIDEO AND STILL PICTURES ARE RELEASED SHOWING SMOKE RISING FROM ONE OF THE TERMINAL BUILDINGS HERE'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU KNOW TYPE OF GUY WELL FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING IT HAPPENED INSIDE THE DEPARTURE ALL THESE ARE TWO EXPLOSIONS AND CENTRED ON AN AMERICAN AIRLINES A DESK THE BELGIAN MEDIA SAYING THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL INJURED PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTURE HALL RIGHT NOW THE CITY'S BEEN ON A STATE OF HIGH ALERT SINCE FRIDAY AND THE ARREST OF THE SUSPECT FROM THE PARIS ATTACKS
SO IT APPEARS THAT AT THE AIRPORT OR AT LEAST PART OF THE AIRPORT HAS BEEN EVACUATED AT THIS MORNING AFTER THOSE EXPLOSIONS TAKE TOOK PLACE AND THAT THE THE AIRPORT ITSELF WAS IN A STATE OF SOME ALERT AND CONFUSION FOLLOWING THOSE EXPLOSIONS WILL HAVE MORE ON THAT AS SOON AS WE CAN
IT IS TWENTY TO WAY TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT HAS ABANDONED PLANS TO CUT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS OVER FOUR YEARS BY REDUCING SOME DISABILITY BENEFITS PROPS THE MAIL TO ASK WHERE IS THE MISSING MONEY GOING TO COME FROM FINANCIAL TIMES ONCE A COMPLETE REORIENTATION OF THE WAY THE WELFARE BUDGET IS CAN FIGURES IT ARGUES THAT THE RELENTLESS PROTECTION OF PENSIONER RIGHTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE WORKING CLASS HAS HAD ITS DAY BUT THE EXPRESS DISAGREES PEOPLE WHO'VE DONE THE RIGHT THING IT SAYS BY WORKING HARD AND PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM
DESERVE TO KNOW THAT IT WILL BE THERE TO HELP THEM IN THEIR OLD AGE WHEN DAVID CAMERON PREPARED HIS APPEARANCE IN THE COMMONS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTING A ROUGH RIDE FOLLOWING THE RESIGNATION OF THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH BUT THEIR DAILY TELEGRAPH SAYS THAT WITH HIS BACK TO THE WAR MISTER CAMERON IS OFTEN AT HIS MOST CONVINCING AND SO IT PROVED YESTERDAY THE DAILY MIRROR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE WAS HELPED WHEN THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN MISSED AN OPEN GOAL BY FAILING TO MENTION MISTER DUNCAN SMITH'S DECISION THE TIME'S A SKETCH WRITER PATRICK KIT CALLED MISTER CORBIN'S TACTICS BIZARRE
IN THE GUARDIAN JOHN CRAY SAYS MISTER CAMERON LOOKED LIKE A MAN WHO COULDN'T BELIEVE HIS LUCK THE METROPOLITAN POLICE WIDELY CRITICISED FOLLOWING THEIR DECISION TO END WHAT THE MALE CALLS THE GROTESQUE AT WITCH HUNT KNOWN AS OPERATION MIDLAND EVEN THOUGH THE INQUIRY IS NOT LEAD TO A SINGLE CHARGE IT SAYS THERE IS NO HINT OF REMORSE FROM SCOTLAND YARD
THE TIMES THINKS THE MISCONCEIVED INVESTIGATION HAS BESMIRCHED THE REPUTATIONS OF INNOCENT MEN AND CALLED INTO QUESTION THE JUDGEMENT OF THE METS COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN THE SON IS UNHAPPY THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN HELD TO ACCOUNT AND NO ONE HAS RESIGNED IN SHORT IT CONCLUDES
IT STINKS AND THE FINANCIAL TIMES AMONG OTHERS FEATURES THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A HOUSE IN THE WEST END OF LONDON WHERE THE SEX PISTOLS LIVED AND MADE THEIR EARLY RECORDINGS HAS BECOME A LISTED BUILDING THE REAL INTEREST ARE SAID TO BE IN GRAFFITI AND DRAWINGS LEFT ON THE WALLS BY JOHNNY ROTTEN DRAWING ON ONE OF THE BAND'S HITS THE F.T. SUMS UP THE STORY WITH THE HEADLINE GRADE TWO STAR LISTED INTERIORS AND WE DON'T CARE
EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AND LET'S GO BACK TO BRUSSELS BRUSSELS AIRPORT WE HEARD AS YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSION PERHAPS EVEN TO PETER PRESIDENT IS AN AUSTRALIAN WHO HAD A STRAIGHT WHO HAS FLOWN INTO THE AIRPORT FROM ATLANTA AND I THINK HE'S ON THE PHONE ON THE AEROPLANE ON HIS PLANE RIGHT NOW MY PERSONAL GOOD MORNING ARE YOU THERE
A GOOD WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
THEY WERE TO EXPLODE IN PUGLIA OR WITH ONE THE AMERICAN
LOUNGE AND ANOTHER ONE WAS THAT THE ACTUAL TRAIN STATION AT THE AIRPORT BEAT HAPPENED RIGHT ABOUT WHY IT WAS
WE WERE TAXIING TO THE GATE WHEN THE WORD BUYERS THAT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET ON WE WERE BUT IF YOU PREPARED
WHY DID THE BIG WAS THE LANDING OR THE ARCHES
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TRANSPOSED ONE ERIC EQUINE
TO ACTUALLY GIVE IT AWAY WE CAN EQUINE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW AND OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH INFORMATION BUT AS FAR AS YOU KNOW HAS THE AIRPORT NOW BEEN EVACUATED ON ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN IT UNTIL THEY'VE GOT YES YES I'LL HAVE YOU ALL BACK AT THE BUILDING ITSELF WAS HAVE YOU BACK
AND WE'RE TOLD THAT THERE IS SMOKE RISING STILL FROM THE BUILDING THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN SHATTERED CAN YOU SEE ANY OF THAT I CAN SEE IT CLOSELY THERE IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT WE CAN BLEEP WHAT I MIGHT I CANNOT PRESUME I'VE BEEN BANGING IT YOU SEE YOU ARE ON THE POINT THAT PRESUMABLY LOTS OF OTHER PLANES ARRIVING AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS YOU THEY'LL BE ALL STACKED UP
THEY STOP WHINING YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE LAST
RIGHT I UNDERSTAND IT SO YES IN FACT I THINK WE'RE NOW GETTING CONFIRMATION THE PLANES HAVE STOPPED LENDING MY PERSONAL THAT'S VERY HELPFUL OF YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE'RE ALSO HEARING THAT RAIL TRAFFIC TO BRUSSELS AIRPORT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED WHILE THAT SITUATION CONTINUES AROUND THE AIRPORT ITSELF THE TIME IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WE JOINED IN A STUDIO THIS MORNING BY THE REVEREND DOCTOR SAM WELLS VICAR OF SAINT MARTIN IN THE FIELDS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
BARACK OBAMA HAS BECOME THE FIRST SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT TO VISIT CUBA FOR NEARLY NINE DECADES FOR FIFTY EIGHT YEARS SINCE FIDEL CASTRO AND CHE GUEVARA'S REVOLUTION CUBA HAS BEEN THE PESKY MOUSE NIBBLING AT THE TOES OF THE ELEPHANT NINETY MILES TO THE NORTH
THE NUCLEAR MISSILE CRISIS OF NINETEEN SIXTY ONE SENT A SHIVER DOWN THE SPINE OF AMERICA YOU CAN STILL HEAR THE RATTLE IN WASHINGTON NOW PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DECIDED THE WINTER HAVE EMBARGOES IS OVER IT'S NO SIMPLE DECISION
WHENEVER YOU'VE HAD TWO GENERATIONS OF ENMITY THERE'S PLENTY OF VESTED INTERESTS AND KEEPING THE ANTAGONISM SHARP EVERYONE HAS AN OPINION ON THE BETRAYAL AND DISGRACE OF CHANGING THE STATUS QUO
BUT THERE COMES A POINT IN ANY LONGSTANDING FEUD BETWEEN NATIONS FAMILIES OR INDIVIDUALS WHEN YOU TAKE STOCK OF THE ENERGY IT REQUIRES TO PERPETUATE THE TENSION TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE MEETINGS AND BYPASS FACE TO FACE ENCOUNTERS AND YOU JUST SAY WHY ARE WE DOING THIS
IN OUR EFFORT TO PUNISH OUR ENEMY STAND UP FOR WHATEVER PRINCIPLE IT WAS THAT NEEDED UPHOLDING AND MAINTAIN THE MORAL HIGH GROUND WE REALLY ACHIEVING ANYTHING BEYOND EXHAUSTED SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS
PEOPLE TEND TO PAINT RECONCILIATION AS NOBLE COSTLY AND SELF DENYING BUT OFTEN ENOUGH IT BEGINS WITH ONE OR BOTH PARTIES SAYING I JUST CAN'T BE BOTHERED WITH ALL THIS RESENTMENT AND CULTIVATED BITTERNESS ANY MORE
CHRISTIAN'S TEND TO EMPHASISE THE SACRIFICE OF JESUS'S DEATH BUT JESUS'S MINISTRY WAS ALL ABOUT SHOWING THAT GOD WILL GO TO ANY LENGTHS TO GET INTO A CONVERSATION WITH US FOR GOD'S SAKE NOT JUST FOR HOURS WHEN YOU'RE AT ODDS WITH ANOTHER PERSON OR ANOTHER COUNTRY YOU HAVE THREE CHOICES YOU CAN DEFEAT THEM THROUGH A FIGHT OR AT LAW
YOU CAN SHOVE THEM THROUGH SANCTIONS OR THE NAUGHTY STEP OR YOU CAN PERSUADE THEM THROUGH TALK SOME CONVERSATIONS AND LISTENING AND EXPLAINING
HOWEVER LONG YOU LEAVE IT YOU ALWAYS END UP WITH CONVERSATION A BATTLE OR A WALL OF SILENCE MAY BE HEARTFELT AND MAY SEEM LIKE THE ONLY LANGUAGE YOUR ANTAGONIST UNDERSTANDS
BUT IT'S A MATTER OF TIME HOURS DAYS EVEN DECADES BEFORE YOU END UP HAVING TO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER
AS YET AS GLOBAL COMMUNICATION BECOMES MORE SOPHISTICATED WE END UP LIVING IN SMALLER AND SMALLER WORLDS OF THOSE WHO WON'T OFFEND US DISTURB US OR FORCE US TO ARTICULATE OUR DIFFERENCES AND REASON THROUGH OUR DISAGREEMENTS WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA NEEDS TO DO IS TO MAKE A GESTURE THAT SHOWS WHAT'S TO BE GAINED BY A NEW RELATIONSHIP AND FIND A FORM OF WORDS THAT PROMISES A FUTURE THAT'S BIGGER THAN THE PAST AFTER FIFTY EIGHT YEARS OF TENSION THERE WON'T BE ANY WINNERS OR LOSERS
BATTLE AND SILENCE ULTIMATELY DISTRACTIONS ALL WE FINALLY HAVE HIS CONVERSATION AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE DOCTOR SAM WELLS THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
THREE SYRIAN TEENAGERS HAVE BECOME THE FIRST UNACCOMPANIED YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE BROUGHT TO THE U.K. ON THE BASIS OF RULES ALLOWING THE REUNIFICATION OF CHILD REFUGEES WITH FAMILY MEMBERS THE THREE HAVE RELATIVES IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CLAIM ASYLUM AND THEY'VE SPENT MONTHS LIVING IN THE JUNGLE CAMP OUTSIDE CALAIS OUR REPORTER'S ZOE CONWAY TRAVELLED WITH THEM TO BRITAIN TO PROTECT THE BOYS ANONYMITY THE NAMES THAT YOU'LL HEAR IN HER REPORT AREN'T THEY REAL ONES
FAMILY PHOTO ON THE BALCONY OF A CALLOW FLAT OVERLOOKING THE ENGLISH CHANNEL THREE SYRIAN BOYS ARE HAVING THEIR PICTURE TAKEN
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM THE CHARITY CITIZENS'
UNTIL THIS MORNING THEY'D SPENT MONTHS LIVING AT THE JUNGLE CAMP IN CALAIS WHAT DO YOU KNOW ME
THEY HAVE A HARROWING STORIES TO TELL OF THEIR TIME IN SYRIA INTRODUCE YOURSELVES I AM FIFTY AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME
IT WAS A VINTAGE YEAR AS LIKE A SEVENTEEN EXACTLY
DELLA I'D BE ALI'S MOTHER AND SISTERS WERE KILLED WHEN A BOMB FELL ON HIS HOME SO WHEN DID THIS TRAGEDY
FIVE SIX MONTHS AGO I THINK MOST PEOPLE LISTENING WILL THINK THAT HE'S INCREDIBLY BRAVE TO HAVE ONE WE WERE FORCED TO ROW BLOOD BUT ALERT DON'T USE OF TELLS OF THEIR FRIGHTENING JOURNEY THROUGH HUNGARY DO VERY SCARED DEMI WENT THREE DAYS
IT REALLY IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT TO BE STANDING ON EUROSTAR PLATFORM WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WITH ALLIE YOU SET AND
BECAUSE HERE THEY ARE MAKING ILLEGAL I'M SAFE CROSSING TO U.K. HOW OFTEN DO WE HEAR THAT STORY JUST A FEW MILES FROM HERE THERE'S THE CALAIS CAMP WHERE THERE WILL BE NO DOUBT CHILDREN PLANNING THEIR OWN DANGEROUS AND ILLEGAL CROSSING TODAY IT'S SIGHT OF TRAINS COMING OUT
OH NO OH NO NOT THAT DAD I'VE GOT TO LAUGH ABOUT THEM WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THE RECORDING IT AND IS VERY DIFFERENT HERE IT IS
UP IN THE DESERT JUST BURNING OF HORRIBLE
YOU SAID HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW YOU'RE IN ENGLAND YOU JUST IN ENGLAND NOW A VERY THANKFUL AND TO EVERYONE WHO'S HELPED ORGANISE THIS WELL I CAN TELL THE LISTER YOU'RE GRINNING FROM EAR TO EAR
YOU'RE VERY BUSY ON YOUR PHONE WHO ARE YOU TEXTING WHO YOU'RE CONTACTING I'VE BROTHERS HIS FAMILY IN SYRIA THE PEOPLE IN THE CAMP EVERYBODY CAMP SEMI WHICH IN THE RING
FOR HER FEEL ALIVE IT WAS HE CONTACT IN SYRIA
THIS MOTHER IS TODAY IS MOTHER'S DAY AND SO SHE SAID IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIFT SHE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE FOR MOTHER'S DAY TO BE SENT THE NEWSY SAFE AND THEY WILL BE ARRIVING SAFELY
ONE HUNDRED WE'RE NOW ON THE PLATFORM AT SAINT PANCREAS AND THE THREE BOYS ARE BEING TAKEN BY BRITISH BORDER GUARDS TO GO AND HAVE THEIR FINGERPRINTS TAKEN
I'M JUST AT THE BORDER FORCE OFFICERS SAINT PANCREAS WHERE THE THREE BOYS ARE BEING REUNITED WITH THEM
IT'S A GIANT HOW DO YOU FEEL THANK YOU SO MUCH HE'S ALMOST STILL GOVERNMENTAL OIL THE DRILL IS TO ONLY ON INTRUSIVE IS IN THE U.K. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND YOU ALI'S BROTHER HEATED MOMENT YES HOW DOES IT FEEL TO SEE HIM
YOU CAN FOOL THESE GOODS
YOU'RE HIS BROTHER HOW DOES IT FEEL TO SEE HIM YOU HAPPY YES VERY HAPPY
THAT REPORT FROM ZOE CONWAY WILL THE CHARITY CITIZENS' U.K. WHICH WAS MENTIONED THEIR ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN IN A SIMILAR POSITION IN CAMPS ON THE FRENCH COAST AND PERHAPS A THOUSAND TOTAL ACROSS EUROPE WE'RE JOINED NOW BY YVETTE COOPER M.P. FORMER SHADOW HOME SECRETARY AND CHAIR OF LABOUR'S REFUGEE TASKFORCE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING IS THIS WAS MADE POSSIBLE NOT BY A COURT ORDER THE JOURNEY OF THESE THREE BOB BECAUSE OF RULES ALLOWING FOR BETTER CO OPERATION BETWEEN BRITAIN AND FRANCE ON THIS
IT TOOK QUITE A LONG TIME THOUGH ACT ON THE BASIS OF THOSE RULES IT HAS TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME IN THESE INDIVIDUAL CASES HAVE TAKEN ABOUT FIVE MONTHS BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE VERY MANY MORE JUST STUCK IN THE SYSTEM THERE'S EVIDENCE OF SOME CASES TAKING NINE MONTHS AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN BEING STUCK IN THE AWFUL MUD AND COLD PARTICULARLY IN CALAIS SO MUCH AT RISK OF ABUSE OR PROSTITUTION OF TRAFFICKING GANGS
AND YET THEY HAVE FAMILY IN BRITAIN WHO COULD BE LOOKING AFTER THEM I THINK YOU'RE A BUREAUCRACY IS FAILING TO YOU SAY THAT ALL OF THOSE CHILDREN IN THIS POSITION IN IN THESE CAMPS SHOULD BE THE ONES WHO HAVE FAMILY IN BRITAIN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COME HERE THEY SHOULD BE A FAST TRACTORS SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT YES BECAUSE THIS IS A RULE THAT APPLIES RIGHTLY RIGHT ACROSS EUROPE IF YOU HAVE
A CHILD WHO HAS CLOSE FAMILY IN ANOTHER COUNTRY WHICHEVER COUNTRY IT MIGHT BE IN THAT THEY SHOULD BE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILY SO THAT THEY CAN BE LOOKED AFTER SO THAT THEY CAN BE PROTECTED AND WE HAD A TERRIBLE CASE EARLIER ON IN THE YEAR OF THE CHILD IN A VERY SIMILAR POSITION CITIZENS YOU K. WERE ALSO PUTTING IN PLACE AN APPLICATION FOR THEM TO COME ON THE SISTER THE SAME WAY
IT WAS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CALLED MUST SEWED WHOSE SISTER IS WAS IN FACT A BRITISH CITIZEN AND YET WHILE HIS PAPERS WERE BEING FILLED IN HE DIED AND WAS HIS BODY WAS FOUND IN THE BACK OF A LORRY IN DUNKIRK BECAUSE HE'S A TEENAGER HE JUST TOOK TERRIBLE RISKS
SEPARATELY THERE WAS A VOTE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS YESTERDAY ON ON ON A SEPARATE BUT RELATED ISSUE WHICH WOULD BE AN AMENDMENT TO THE IMMIGRATION BILL TO ALLOW UNACCOMPANIED CHILD REFUGEES TO TO TO COME TO THE U.K. WHICH THAT RAISES A DIFFERENT ISSUE WHICH IS THAT FOSTER FAMILIES WOULD HAVE TO BE FOUND FOR FOR MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN WHICH IS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO FOR
BRITISH CHILDREN TODAY THAT'S RIGHT AND IT'S AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS US NOW AGAIN RIGHT ACROSS EUROPE AND ANYWHERE WHERE REFUGEES PARTICULARLY FROM SYRIA BUT NOT JUST FROM SYRIA HAVE FLED TO SAVE THE CHILDREN ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND CHILD REFUGEES ON THEIR OWN IN EUROPE NOW WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN'S HOMES IN ITALY ARE FULL WE KNOW THAT GREECE CANNOT COPE AND SAVE THE CHILDREN HAVE ASKED US TO JUST TAKE THREE THOUSAND OF THOSE CHILD REFUGEES
AND YOU KNOW AGAIN MANY OF THEM ARE CITIZENS U.K. HAVE SAID WE'LL ACTUALLY HAVE FAMILY IN BRITAIN WHO COULD LOOK AFTER THEM AND ALF DUBS WAS MANY OF THEM HOW MANY OF THE THREE THOUSAND WITH HER FAMILY IN BRITAIN WILL YOU QUOTED CISTERNS U.K. SAYING THEY MIGHT BE AS MANY AS A THOUSAND BUT THE TRUTH IS WE DON'T KNOW NONE OF US KNOW THE ACTUAL NUMBERS THAT SO MANY OF THESE CHILDREN ARE DISAPPEARING AT THE MOMENT EUROPOL RECKON THAT ABOUT TEN THOUSAND OF THEM HAVE DISAPPEARED
ALMOST CERTAINLY INTO THE ARMS OF TRAFFICKING GANGS WE KNOW THERE WAS TERRIBLE RISK OF ABUSE AND PROSTITUTION AND I'M WONDERING IF THOSE THREE THOUSAND DID COME TO THE U.K. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BE PROPERLY PROVIDED FOR WHETHER IN FOSTER FAMILIES OR CHILDREN TURNS THAT'S RIGHT WELL IT WOULD NEED PEOPLE OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY WOULDN'T COUNCILS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DO THEIR BIT AND AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE IT EVEN MORE RISK IF WE DON'T DO OUR BIT SO I THINK FOR US TO HELP THREE THOUSAND OUT OF THE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND IS FAIR
AND IT'S ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF CHILDREN PER LOCAL AUTHORITY SO LONG AS IT IS ACROSS LOCAL AUTHORITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEN I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT BRITAIN SHOULD DO BUT LET'S NOT PRETEND IT'S EASY IT'S NOT EASY BUT WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE JUST ABANDONING CHILDREN WITH NOBODY TO LOOK AFTER THEM BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY SAYS WHAT YOU JUST SAID THEN WELL IT'S JUST TOO HARD WE CAN'T FIND WE CAN'T FIND THE FAMILIES WE CAN'T FIND PEOPLE TO SUPPORT THEM AND THEREFORE EVERYBODY JUST TURNS THEIR BACK AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT WOULD CAUSE HUGE PROBLEMS FOR SOME OF THEM ARE NOT YOUNG CHILDREN THEY'RE THERE
OLDER BUT THEY'RE TEENAGERS SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS FOR EXAMPLE ONES WE HEARD ABOUT AND VERY CONWAY'S REPORT THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S A DIFFERENT MIX OF DIFFERENT AGES AND I SPOKE FOR EXAMPLE YESTERDAY TO A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY AND CALAIS HE'S JUST THERE ON HIS OWN I KNOW THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS MY KIDS AND I YOU THINK FOR THOSE CHILDREN TO BE SO MUCH AT RISK SO THERE ARE YOUNGER CHILDREN AS WELL THERE ARE TEENAGERS TO
THEY ALL NEED SUPPORT AND THEY DO NEED SPECIALIST SUPPORT THIS IS NOT EASY THERE'S NO POINT IN PRETENDING IT IS BUT IN TWENTY YEARS' TIME DO WE WANT TO LOOK BACK AND THINK WE DIDN'T DO OUR BIT TO HELP IN THE GREATEST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS TO HELP TO HIT EUROPE SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR WE DID HELP WITH THE KINDER TRANSPORT MANY YEARS AGO ALF DUBS WHO PUT THE AMENDMENT THROUGH THE HOUSE OF LORDS WITH VERY STRONG SUPPORT YESTERDAY WAS HIMSELF RESCUE FROM THE NAZIS BY THE KINDER TRANSPORT HE'S ASKING US TO DO THE SAME AGAIN NOW
ON ANOTHER NOTE WERE YOU IN THE COMMONS YESTERDAY WHEN THE WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER MADE HIS STATEMENT I WAS YES WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE WAY JEREMY CORBIN RESPONDED I THINK THAT YOU KNOW HE RAISED THE ISSUES AROUND REFUGEES AND THOSE WITHOUT MANY OF THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I DIDN'T IAIN DUNCAN SMITH I THINK THE REAL ISSUE YESTERDAY WAS WHERE ON EARTH WAS THE CHANCELLOR HE HAS JUST GONE A WALL AND HE SENT OTHER MINISTERS TO COME ON DEFEND THIS SHAMEFUL UNRAVELLING BUDGET WHERE THEY WERE WRONGLY HIT THE DISABLED
AT THE SAME TIME AS CUTTING TAXES FOR THOSE ON THE HIGHEST INCOMES AND I'VE NEVER SEEN A SITUATION WHERE THE CHANCELLOR HAS TO CHANGE HIS BUDGET WITHIN TWO DAYS AND THEY OFTEN USED TO COME TO HAVE GOT A GOVERNMENT WERE ROCKED BY BY THE RESIGNATION OF A SENIOR FIGURE WAS IT A MISTAKE FOR JEREMY CORBIN NOT TO MENTION IAN DUNCAN SMITH I THINK JENNY HAS TO SET OUT DECIDE HIMSELF WHAT ISSUES HE WANTS TO RAISE IN RESPONSE TO INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS BUT I THINK WITH A TIME WHEN
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS SAID THIS IS A DEEPLY UNFAIR BUDGET THAT THIS IS A BUDGET WHICH DIVIDES RATHER THAN UNITES IT IS GEORGE OSBORNE THAT SHOULD BE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS I THINK IT WAS FRANKLY COWARDLY FOR HIM NOT TO COME TO PARLIAMENT YESTERDAY HE SHOULD BE IN PARLIAMENT SETTING OUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO NOW BECAUSE HIS BUDGET SUMS DON'T ADD UP AND HE NEEDS TO SET OUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO AND HE'LL BE THERE LATER TODAY YVETTE COOPER THANK YOU
AND IT IS NOW TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST ON JOHN THANK YOU NICE START TO THE DAY ACTUALLY ACROSS MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BEAUTIFUL WEATHER HERE IN LONDON AND ACROSS SO MANY OTHER PLACES LOTS OF SUNSHINE ON THE WAY THIS MORNING IT'S A LITTLE BIT CHILLY IN ONE OR TWO PLACES WE DID HAVE A TOUCH OF FROST ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND WALES AS A BIT OF MIST AND FOG AROUND WITH THAT SHOULD CLEAR VERY VERY SOON IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO
AND THEN WE'RE LEFT OVER WITH A QUIET DAY VERY LITTLE CHANGE FROM YESTERDAY AT THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE JUST LIKE YESTERDAY WILL BE IN THE SOUTH THE SOUTH EAST AND TO THE EAST OF THE PENNINES SO ANYWHERE SAFE FROM HULL TO NORWICH LONDON DOWN INTO SOUTHAMPTON I THINK A FINE DAY FOR YOU HERE AND WE COULD SEE TEMPERATURES AS HIGH AS AROUND A FOURTEEN DEGREE CELSIUS DEPENDING ON HOW LONG WE KEEP THAT SUNSHINE FOR THAT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD BUBBLING UP DURING THE DAY
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR THE NORTH AND WEST ACROSS THE U.K. CERTAINLY AROUND THE IRISH SEA FOR NORTHERN IRELAND WESTERN SCOTLAND IT'S A CLOUDIER DAY AND AS A RESULT IT'S GOING TO BE COOLER SO I THINK IN BELFAST AROUND NINE DEGREES BUTTS IN ABERDEENSHIRE I THINK TEMPERATURES STILL COULD GET UP TO AROUND TWELVE TONIGHT VERY LITTLE CHANGE A FEW CLEAR SPELLS IN TOUCH OF FROST IN ONE OR TWO AREAS
AND THEN TOMORROW BRIEFLY WE MIGHT NEED YOUR OUR UMBRELLAS IN BELFAST AND GLASGOW THERE IS A BRIEF SPELL OF RAIN ON THE WAY DURING THE MORNING AND AFTERNOON BUT FOR THE BULK OF THE U.K. AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE A DRY DAY AND WITH SOME RAIN ON THE WAY FOR THURSDAY THAT'S IT YOU'RE UP TO DATE THANK YOU TRANA HOUSE OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DO WITH JIHADISTS WHO RETURN HOME TONIGHT RADIO FOUR TRIES TO FIND OUT
I THINK WESTERN COMES BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY THIS
WHAT ARE THEY THINKING ABOUT AND WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WHEN THEY COME BACK WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF BRITONS TRAVELLING TO SYRIA B.B.C. RADIO FOUR ASKS WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO DE RADICALISE THOSE WHO HAVE RETURNED TO THE U.K. I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE PERSON THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE DECISION WHETHER TO RELEASE HER PERSONAL TO LOCK HIM UP IF YOU DO MAKE THAT IS NOT ONLY SOMETHING YOU GET IT WRONG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE

REBEKAH JONES REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT ALL FLIGHTS TO AND FROM BRUSSELS HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED THIS MORNING AFTER TWO EXPLOSIONS REPORTED TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE NEAR THE AMERICAN AIRLINES CHECK IN DESK WITH HUNDREDS OF PASSENGERS IN THE DEPARTURE HALL AT THE TIME IN THE AFTERMATH SIRENS COULD BE HEARD INSIDE THE TERMINAL
ARE THEY
AIRPORT STAFF TOLD PEOPLE TO LEAVE THEIR LUGGAGE BEHIND SOME WERE LED OUT ONTO THE TARMAC AND OTHERS TOLD TO EVACUATE
THE TELEVISION PICTURES FROM THE AIRPORT IN THE AREA OUTSIDE NOW SMOKE RISING FROM THE TERMINAL BUILDING WINDOWS ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING BLOWN OUT SO CLEARLY THE CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE AFTER THESE EXPLOSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE APPARENTLY NEAR THE AMERICAN AIRLINE STAIRS CASUALTIES ARE BEING REPORTED WE DON'T KNOW YET HOW MANY PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INJURED BUT ALL FLIGHTS
HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED AND RAIL TRAFFIC TO THE AIRPORT'S ALSO BEEN SUSPENDED THE CITY'S AUTHORITIES ARE ASKING PEOPLE NOT TO TRAVEL TO TO THE AIRPORT AT ALL WE DID MANAGER EARLIER TO SPEAK TO CHARLOTTE MCDONALD GIBSON IS THE BRUSSELS CORRESPONDENT FOR THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER AND HE'S AT THE AIRPORT
THEY'D KNOCK THE THIN TERMINAL A DEPARTURE CALL I WOULD HAVING BACK WITH THE STARSHIP CAME RUSHING ANYTHING YOU'VE GOT LEAD WE'VE GOT
I THINK YOUR NUMBERS AND THEY
WHY DIDN'T HE SAY WHERE WE ARE WE DID IT HERE EARLIER SOME REPORTS ABOUT ARABIC BEING SHOUTED AND SHOT BEING FIRED BEFORE THE EXPLOSIONS ARE TOOK PLACE AND WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS SHORTLY THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST EIGHT
WHEN GEORGE OSBORNE SAT DOWN AFTER HIS BUDGET SPEECH A WEEK AGO HE GOT THE CUSTOMARY PATS ON THE BACK AND BIG SMILES FROM THE PRIME MINISTER AND HOME SECRETARY SITTING EITHER SIDE OF HIM WHEN HE RETURNS TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TODAY THERE WILL BE NO SMILES HE'S BEING FORCED TO DEFEND HER BUDGET BUT HAS BEEN DISINTEGRATING BEFORE HIS EYES THE LABOUR PARTY SAYS HE SHOULD CHUCK IT OUT AND START AGAIN BUT IT'S NOT ONLY THE OPPOSITION ATTACKING HIM IT'S HIS OWN SIDE TO THE LAST CHANCELLOR WHO WAS ACTUALLY DEFEATED IN THE HOUSE ON A BUDGET MEASURE
IT WAS KEN CLARKE AND HE'S WITH ME GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD BODIES UP ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE JOINING UP TO SLAG OFF GEORGE OSBORNE AND SAY IT'S NO I'M NOT EITHER IT'S SLIGHTLY ABSURD THAT THE WHOLE BUDGET WAY IT'S NOW REDUCED TO THIS CLASH BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE I SERVED WITH THE CABINET FOR FOUR YEARS TOGETHER I CAN ON ROBO WOULD BOTH OF THEM SO EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE SIDES IT'S A PITY THEY DISAGREED THEY AGREED ON A POLICY LAST WEDNESDAY AND THEY WERE FALLING OUT OF MY LAST FRIDAY
IT WASN'T IN THE BUDGET THE POLICY THEY'D ANNOUNCED IT THE WEEK BEFORE WITH NOBODY OPPOSING IT VERY MUCH BUT THEN THEY SEEM TO HAVE HAD A ROW BUT HOW IT SHOULD BE PRESENTED AND WHO WAS GOING TO PRESENT IT WHAT IT WAS NOW WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS ROW AND IT'S ALL WRAPPED UP WITH
EUROPA THE LEADERSHIP AND ALL THIS KIND OF NOT EXACTLY SUBTLE LOW TO ANNOUNCE THE TAKING AWAY FROM DISABLED PEOPLE SOME OF THEIR BENEFITS AND SIMULTANEOUS ASSAY ON BY THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE MIDDLE CLASS OF EXTRA BENEFITS WELL TAKING AWAY DISABLE BENEFITS BECAUSE PART OF IT THEY'VE GOT WRONG THE REASON IT WAS ALL AGREED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND SIGNED UP TO WAS NO ONE EXPECTED THIS PARTICULAR BIT OF PIPS TO SOAR AWAY I MEAN THIS PROGRAMME
ISN'T THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME TO ACTUALLY DISCUSS THE ISSUES ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF DISABLE BENEFITS WHICH NO ONE IS NOW EVEN REFERRING TO ITS GENTLER BUT ACTUALLY THEY'VE BEEN PAYING FOR EXTRA COSTS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INCURRING EXTRA COSTS MAY HAVE A STUDY ON WHICH IT WAS BASED WHEN THEN ANNOUNCED IT EVEN THE LABOUR PARTY DIDN'T CREATE VERY MUCH STIR
BUT THEN CAME ALL THE POLITICS OF THE BUDGET IT'S A SURPRISINGLY IT WAS MEANT TO BE A POPULAR BUDGET IT ACTUALLY EASES FISCAL POLICY WHICH ISN'T WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IT'S REDUCED TAXES AND PUT OFF SPENDING CUTS WHICH IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE FIRST BUDGET AFTER AN ELECTION BUT WHAT IT'S TURNED INTO RATHER LIKE IN A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WE CAN TURN INTO IS THEIR PERSONALITIES AND THEIR PERSONALITY ARGUMENT BECAUSE
IAN WAS IN A FUNNY POSITION ANYWAY COS HE'S STILL IN A CABINET HAVING A PUBLIC DEBATE ON A FUNDAMENTAL BE KICKING LUMPS OUT OF THE RHYME IN THE WORLD AND THAT'S WHAT LIVES ON THE BACK BUT BUT WHAT BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE WELFARE BILL WAS AND I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU HAD YOU HAD TO CUT BACK ON THOSE SO CALLED PIPS YEAH HAD WORK OUT HOW YOU ARE CALCULATING IT AND WE WERE NOW SPENDING MORE EVERYBODY
ACTUALLY IN EVERY POLITICAL PARTY WISHES TO GIVE BENEFITS TO DISABLED PEOPLE WHO CAN'T WORK TO ENABLE THEM ACTUALLY TO LEAD AS NEAR NORMAL WORK WORK WORK WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT THEY GOT THINGS PAID FOR THAT THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY MANY OF THEM DIDN'T ACTUALLY NEED AT ALL SOMEBODY IF YOU WERE IF YOU HAD AN APPLIANCE YOU WERE REGARDED AS HAVING EXTRA COSTS
AND A VERY GOOD CIVIL SERVANT CALLED PAUL GRAY STUDDED IT AND FOUND NINETY PER CENT OF THEM DIDN'T HAVE EXTRA COS THE ACTUAL UNDERLYING INCA DISABLED PEOPLE NOWADAYS IS QUITE RIGHTLY VASTLY HIGHER THAN IT WAS IN MY DAY AS CHANCELLOR WE USE ASTONISHING POSITION WHERE WE ARE PAYING OUT MORE TO DISABLED PEOPLE BY BENEFIT IN THE ENTIRE BODY OF THE MILLER'S RIGHT DEFEND WHAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THEY SHOULD HAVE WORKED
WE WERE GOING TO EXPLAIN IT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO CERTAINLY BUT NOW WE'RE STUCK WITH IT BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE ANY MORE OH LOVELY SEAT OF THAT LIQUID SO THEY RETREATED COMPLETE LESS WHEN THEY HAD THE ROW THEY'RE GREAT ON THE POLICY AT THEIR NAMES SEEM TO BLAME EACH OTHER FOR DROPPING IT AND ANYWAY THIS IS BY BUT I'M HELPFUL COMMENT IS I DO I WAS AT THIS END SWITCH GOES TAKE POTENTIAL TO THE BUDGET RATHER A BUT BUT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT ISN'T IT BECAUSE NOW WE'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER DEPARTMENT APPARENTLY RING FENCE WE'VE ALREADY GOT HEALTH RING FENCED WE'VE GOT OVERSEAS AID RING FENCE WE'VE GOT SCHOOLS RING FENCE AND SO ON AND SO ON NOW WE'VE GOT THIS MASSIVE WELFARE BILL APPARENTLY RING FENCE AS WELL WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE THEM WITH A SERIOUS BLACK HOLE OR BUT WILL PEOPLE SAY WELL HE'S ONLY A BILLION A YEAR SO WHAT WELL I DIDN'T I DIDN'T PICK THAT UP WHEN I LISTEN TO THE STATEMENT IN THE HOUSE YESTERDAY I WAS THERE I WAS THERE ALL AFTERNOON QUITE ME ATTENDING AFTERNOON AND THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE CAME IN
THE USUAL FORM OF WORDS IS WE HAVE NO PRESENT PLANS TO MAKE A FLOW THOUGH CUTS HIS WELFARE AS A FORMER CHANCELLOR I'D BE RATHER STARTLED IF YOU WERE RULING OUT EVER AGAIN REDUCING ANY ASPECT OF THE WELFARE BENEFIT THAT'S WHAT I WANTED DOESN'T IT
LIKE I SAID IT'S INCONCEIVABLE YOU CAN'T DO THAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO INDEED I THINK WE HAVE RING FENCED RATHER TOO MUCH AS YOU IMPLY AND WE RULED OUT TOO MANY TAXES FROM ANY INCREASE AND FORTUNATELY GEORGE I THINK HE'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BRILLIANTLY SUCCESSFUL LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS DESPITE ALL THESE CONSTRAINTS OF MODERN POLITICS IF I MAY TALK AS AN OLD FASHIONED DRAMA SLUR
HE HAS MATT IT WAS TO GET A CROP OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS PRODUCED AT THE MOMENT THE FASTEST GROWING WHEN HE HASN'T WELL HE SENT YOU TO A LOT OF TOUGH DECISIONS YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE SOMEONE'S GOT TO TAKE OVER THE COURSE OF THIS PARLIAMENT TO KEEP US ON COURSE COS THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK ISN'T GREAT WE'RE STILL RUNNING A DEFICIT DESPITE THE FACT THE ECONOMY'S GROWING AND YOU CAN'T JUST PILE UP DEBT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS SO YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE ON SOME LOBBY SOMEWHERE ALL RIGHT SO WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES FOR EVERYTHING AS I FOUND WHEN I WAS CHANCE WELL HE DID BUT THAT'S THAT'S
PART OF THE GAME AND IF SO WHAT DO I DO NOW WHAT SHOULD HE DO NOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS EXPLAIN THE UNDERLYING STRATEGY OF WHY WE NEED TO TACKLE THE DEFICIT BUT WHAT'S CREEPING INTO THE DEBATE ABOUT POLICY IS SOMEHOW WE DON'T NEED TO BOTHER MONEY'S CHEAP LET'S JUST BORROW IT TAXES SHOULD BE THINGS THAT ONLY GO DOWN AND SPENDING IS SOMETHING AN ONLY GIRL
AND YOU GUS DON'T CHALLENGE ANY OF THE POWERFUL LOBBIES WHICH EXIST NOWADAYS WE TRY TO DO ANYTHING UNPOPULAR KEN CLARKE I WOULD LIKE TO PROLONG THIS BUT OTHER STUFF IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AS YOU WELL KNOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US IT IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND WE ARE GETTING MORE NEWS FROM BRUSSELS WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN EXPLOSIONS AT THE AIRPORT AND WE HAVE ON THE LINE SOMEBODY WHO WAS I THINK THEY'RE AT THE TIME DID KURT AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU
YOU WERE ACTUALLY IN THE AIRPORT TERMINAL AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSIONS WERE YOU YEAH THAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT DID YOU SEE A BABY YOU CAME OUT OF THE BECKETTS ARYANS OF THE ARRIVALS HALL WONDERFUL THICK EXPLORES ANOTHER I DON'T KNOW BUT APPARENTLY THEY'VE GOT TO UP TO ME IT FELT LIKE THAT
YOUR FAVOURITE UPSTAIRS STOP THROWING SOMETHING BIG ON THE FLOOR BASICALLY AND EVERYTHING
WHAT'S GOING ON THEN EVERYBODY WAS PHYSICALLY SCREAMING AND RUNNING THEM BUT THE AREA THAT'S WHAT I DID AS WELL
I THINK YOU'VE GONE DAD GETTING THROUGH IT GUIDED PEOPLE AND FOR THE PARTY
IT'S WONDERFUL IT MUST HAVE BEEN IF YOU HEARD THE BUILDING I DO SELL THE BUILDING ACTUALLY SHAKE IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY SERIOUS EXPLOSION AND INDEED A VERY BIG ONE ISN'T IT FELT LIKE IT SUDDENLY FELT LIKE ON AND I'M STILL A BIT SHAKY AND DO YOU KNOW OF ANY DID YOU SEE ANYBODY INJURED OR DO YOU KNOW OF ANYBODY WHO WAS INJURED OR PERHAPS KILLED
GOING TO THE AIRPORT WHEN I GOT THAT OUT I'VE GOT THUMB ON THAT YOU CONVINCED THEY'RE KEPT LIKE THAT
WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US ABOUT IT THAT NEIL'S FLICKER FLICKER ALL DONE ALSO ON THE LINE IS OUR CORRESPONDENT BEN RIGHT AND I THINK THEN YOU ARE JUST APPROACHING THE AIRPORT NOW
I'M ON THE CORNER OF THE RING ROAD IN THE SLIP ROAD THAT LEADS TO THE AIRPORT THAT YEAR KILOMETRES
YET WHAT IT UP THE ROAD HAD BEEN BLOCKED OFF BY POLICE THEY'RE YOU KNOW A CONSTANT STREAM OF HER MAJESTY BEAR CALLED AMBULANT
FIRE CREW SHREW OBVIOUSLY RESPONDING TO WHAT IS A VERY LARGE EMERGENCY SITUATION NOW TRAFFIC ON THE RING ROAD IS COMPLETELY GRIDLOCKED WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND WALK FURTHER TOWARDS THE AIRPORT FROM HERE
BUT AS THE PREVIOUS INTERVIEW HE WERE WITH WHIPPING MCLEAN THERE ARE POOR
AND PAY OFF IN THE AFTERMATH OF WHAT THE CHILL EXPLOSIONS THAT HAPPEN
IN THE DEPARTURE AREA AT THE MAIN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
IN BRUSSELS A REPORT THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN
AT THE CHECK IN DESK OF AMERICAN AIRLINES NOT A BEEP RUFFLE POLICE HAVE TOLD A BUSTLE YOU'D AGENCY THAT ONE YOU CAN
COULD BE MORE PEOPLE THAN THAT IT IS CLEARLY NOT GOAT IT LATER NO NO FLIGHT LANDING AT THE MOMENT RUSSELL RAY ONE BROTHER'S RADIO STATION WRITTEN HE SAID THE FLIGHTS ARE NOW BEING WITHOUT IT
THEREFORE SHALLOWER WE SING IS STILL OPEN TO BE BURIED AT THIS AIRPORT NOW REALLY SHUT DOWN EXACTLY I WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE PICTURES ON THE STILL PICTURES THAT HAD EMERGED OF THE INSIDE OF THE TERMINAL BUILDING WHERE THIS HAPPENED YOU CAN SEE THE CEILING TILES THAT HAVE COME DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE INSIDE
AS YOU SAY IN A HIGH STATE OF ALERT AND IT'S ONLY A FEW DAYS SINCE WE SAW THE ARREST OF OTHER PARIS TERROR SUSPECTS TO SALAAM IN BRUSSELS
YES THAT'S RIGHT AND THE AIRPORT WILL HAVE BEEN POPULAR WITH COMMUTERS HEADING OFF THE FLIGHT THE CROP MAINLY THAT
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PACKED AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
RUSSELL HAS BEEN A VERY CAMP MY TEETH AND ANOTHER MEMBER ATTACKS BECAUSE OF COURSE MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED IN
BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE PLANNING THAT HAPPEN
BUT THAT ATTACK THERE HAD BEEN A VERY HEAVY SILLY QUAID BY MILITARY PRESENCE ON THE STREET IN BUTTER
THEN THERE WAS OF COURSE THE WRECK THE PLANT IT'S A BIG BREAKTHROUGH BOOK BUT I THOUGHT OF
FRIDAY THAT DIDN'T CHANGE THE TERROR ALERT NOW HAS BEEN A FEELING THAT THIS IS THE TENT CITY IT'S A PITY THAT HE'S ALWAYS ON THE LOOK ON GUARD THE THROMBOSIS
A LOT OF FOCUS ON THAT WALL AND BAKING AREA AND IF THIS IF THIS IS A PARROT THAT WHICH LOOKS LIKELY THEN
BADLY THEY'LL BE PEOPLE A WHILE HORRIFIED NOT COMPLETELY RIGHT IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE CITY JUST AS YOU'RE TALKING THEN WAS SEEING A REPORT COMING IN FROM REUTERS OF ANOTHER EXPLOSION THIS TIME AT A METRO STATION IN BRUSSELS CLOSE TO E.U. INSTITUTIONS
YOU SEEN THAT AD THERE FOR ME I HAVEN'T I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO PROBABLY HAVE THOUGHT THEIR WALKING UP THIS ROPE THAT LOT
THAT WAS IF THAT IS TRUE
ONE THAT GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF A COORDINATED YEAH MAKE LIKE THAT I I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT WE WILL WELL I'LL LET YOU GET GET ONTO AS CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT AS YOU CAN THEN WRITE A BRUSSELS CORRESPONDENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST EIGHT
IS THE GOVERNMENT COMPLICIT IN MAINTAINING THE GAP BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF MEN AND WOMEN ARE PAID THAT IS THE CONCLUSION OF A CROSS PARTY GROUP OF M.P.S WHICH HAS SAID THAT GOVERNMENT POLICY IS PERPETUATING RATHER THAN CHANGING THE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE AVERAGE HOURLY WAGE OF A WOMAN IS NEARLY TEN PER CENT LESS THAN A MAN
WE'RE JOINED NOW BY NICOLA HORLICK CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF MONEY AND CO AND BY ALEX TO PLEDGE WHO FOUNDED HASSLE DOT COMMA A WEBSITE FOR FINDING DOMESTIC CLEANERS GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING IT IS A SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS NICOLA TO BE IN FORTY YEARS AFTER THE EQUAL PAY ACT YES IT IS IT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AND THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS SUGGESTIONS LATELY ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT BE DEALT WITH ONE WAS FOR EXAMPLE THAT MAY BE COMPANIES LARGER COMPANIES SHOULD BE MADE TO PUBLISH ALL THE PAY OF THE SEA ANONYMOUSLY
ALL THEM EMPLOYEES SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AND THAT WOULD THEN PUT PRESSURE ON MANAGERS AND THAT ISN'T IN THE FOCUS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT KIND OF TRANSPARENCY FOR LARGER EMPLOYER NOT I THINK THERE WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA PERSONALLY I DON'T SEE ANYTHING THAT PUBLISH EVERYBODY'S NAMES BUT TO ACTUALLY SEE HOW FEMALES HAVE PAID WITHIN AN ORGANISATION AGAINST EQUIVALENT MALES WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA A GOOD IDEA BUT NOT ENOUGH ALEX TO PLEDGE I MEAN I I PERSONALLY THINK THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD
NOT INCENTIVISE SCHEMES THAT KIND OF TRY TO ADVANCE WOMEN I THINK THAT WE CAN GET THERE ON OUR OWN AND I THINK THAT MEDDLING CAN OFTEN HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS I THINK NO NOT ALWAYS ONE OF THE PLACES THAT HAS A GREAT REPRESENTATION AT THE BOARD LEVEL BUT ACTUALLY HAVING SPOKEN TO MANY PROFESSORS IN NORWAY WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WORRY ABOUT IS THAT DOESN'T TRICKLE DOWN AND ACTUALLY ON A MIDDLE MANAGEMENT IT CAN BE ON EQUALS I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE SHOULD BE TAKING ARE YOU SAYING LEAVE IT TO THE MARKET ENTIRELY THEN
COS THAT HASN'T WORKED FOR FORTY YEARS AND IN TERMS OF BRIDGING THE GAP SO I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING MORE SYSTEMIC AT PLAY HERE AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE CARER AIM IN SOCIETY IN THAT STILL REMAINS THE WOMAN I THINK IF WE WERE TO TO MOVE IN A DIRECTION WHERE WE COULD
LEGISLATE A INTRODUCED POLICY I WOULD MUCH PREFER TO SEE MEN AND WOMEN GET EQUAL MATERNITY AND PATERNITY POLICIES THAT'S WHAT WE MOVE TO ODDS IN MY COMPANY MY WORK VERY EFFECTIVELY WHERE BOTH OF THEM THEIR MOTHER AND THEIR FATHER PLAY AN EQUAL ROLE AND WHAT THAT ACTUALLY DOES HIS NEW TRIES A CONVERSATION BECAUSE A RETURN TO WORK AND THEIR ABSENCE AND IT'S GONE FROM THE HIGH RING AND THEY'RE KIND OF MANAGEMENT OF EMPLOYEES WITHIN FIN OUR SAID SO THAT MEANS THAT IT CAN'T BE USED AGAINST WOMEN YOU'VE BEEN OUT OF THE WORKPLACE FOR THIS LONG AND THAT IS WHY YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAID US AS MUCH AS THE MAN SITTING NEXT TO YOU
NICOLA HORLICK WOOD WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT SORT OF IDEA FOR YOU IF YOU FOCUS ON MORE RIGHTS FOR MEN DOES THAT DOES DOES THAT HELP THE WOMEN WELL I THINK IT DEPENDS WHAT INDUSTRY AROUND AND FINANCIAL SERVICES WHICH IS MY INDUSTRY I I DON'T SEE IT HAS BEEN VERY LIKELY THAT MEN THERE TAKE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF LEAVE WHEN A BABY'S BORN AS WHEN THEN UNFORTUNATELY IT'S SUCH A CUTTHROAT ENVIRONMENTS AND SAY EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO CLIMB UP THE GREASY POLE SO I DON'T I'M NOT SURE THAT WOULD NECESSARILY GET OVER THE ISSUE I THINK THERE ARE
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WHICH MANY WAYS A GOOD COS HE'D THAT'S WHY YOU WANT MEN AND WOMEN AND ORGANISATIONS COS YOU END UP WITH A BETTER ORGANISATION OVERALL BUT WOMEN ARE LESS PUSHY OR LESS VOCAL ABOUT WANTING TO BE PAID MORE AND I'VE SEEN THAT AS A MANAGER AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO SPEAK UP MORE
AND TO GET OVER THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU SIT IN THE CORNER AND WORK TERRIBLY HARD SOMEBODY'S GOING TO NOTICE COS THEY WON'T NECESSARILY SO YOU WOULD ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO BE MORE VOCAL MORE PUSHY BECAUSE THEN YOU END UP IN A POTENTIALLY GETTING CALLED AGGRESSIVE AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WELL THAT'S HARDLY EVER REGARDED AS AS POSITIVE FOR A WOMAN YEAH BUT I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF VERY AGGRESSIVE MAN WHY SHOULDN'T WOMEN BE A BIT MORE PUSHY
ALEX TO PLEDGE I MEAN I COMPLETELY WHOLE HARDLY AGREE WITH NICOLA I THINK THAT THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TRAITS THAT WOMEN LACK IS CONFIDENCE AND THEY OFTEN CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT HOW THEY'RE PERCEIVED IN AND VIEWED BY THE PEOPLE AND I HAVE INSTANCES WHERE I'VE WOMEN HAVE US FOR PAY RISES AND THEY'VE ONLY ASK ONCE AND THEN MORE CONTINUITY AND I THINK THAT'S
SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE ENCOURAGED BUT I'D I ACTUALLY THINK TOP TALKING NEGATIVELY ABOUT WOMEN IN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY AND FINANCE ACTUALLY DOES MORE TO DISSUADE WOMEN FROM TRYING TO BE CONFIDENT WE NEED TO CHANGE TO DISCUSS FROM BEING ONE TO SELL AT THE CELEBRATING WOMEN THAT WE SEE OUT THAT I'M NOT JUST THE SEND FIVE WOMEN EVERY TIME AND I SUPPOSE THE BALANCES ALSO ON WHERE YOU SEE THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU KNOW IS IT IS IT THE WOMAN'S RESPONSIBILITY TO TO DO THE PUSHING OR IS IT SOCIETY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD
WELL CLEARLY WE'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE THE FACT THAT IT'S WOMEN WHO HAVE CHILDREN MODERN MAN AND I DO VERY STRONG POLICE THAT HIT SOCIETY'S DUTY TO SUPPORT WOMEN THROUGH THOSE YEARS AND WE'VE GOT TO TRY AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE MORE POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE IN THEIR CAREER AND ALSO GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO THEIR CHILDREN WITHOUT THAT BEING SEEN AS A NEGATIVE AUTHORED BEING PENALISED FINANCIALLY NICOLA HORLICK AND ALEX TO PLEDGE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH

YOU'D THINK A RIVER WILL BE A DISCREET PLACE TO DISPOSE OF INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE NOT SO ACCORDING TO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST CAROLINE ROBERTS AND TO PARAPHRASE THE B. B. C. DETECTIVE SERIES A WATERWAY IS LIKE A SILENT WITNESS SHE APPLIES WATER SCIENCE TO WORK OUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN A BODY IS FOUND FLOATING IN A CANAL FOR EXAMPLE
SOLVING WATER RELATED MYSTERIES IS A THEME THAT RUNS THROUGH CAROLINE'S WORK SHE MAKES SENSE OF THE CHAOS WHEN PARTS OF THE U.K. ARE SUBMERGED BY DEVASTATING FLOOD AND DRIVES FORWARD NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM IT TURNS OUT THAT THOSE HUMBLE SAM BACK WE SEE ON THE NEWS I JUST MUCH MORE TROUBLE THAN THEY'RE WORTH ME FOR KAREN AND ROBERT'S LIFE SCIENTIFIC AFTER THE NEWS AT NINE

THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF BEEN INFORMATION TO STEVE ARE ABOUT TO STRIKE IMMINENTLY AND BY TERRORIST ATTACK THAT COULD RANGE AT ONE END OF THE SCALE TO PUMPING THIS HORRIFIC IT WAS COORDINATED AS THE LONDON BOMBINGS YOU AN INDIVIDUAL OPPORTUNISTIC ATTACK LIKE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE LATEST WE'RE IS THAT AT LEAST ONE PERSON HAS BEEN KILLED IN BRUSSELS THE REUTERS NEWS AGENCY IS REPORTING THAT UP TO TEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AND THIRTY OTHERS INJURED IN THE BLAST AT THE AIRPORT AND ALSO HAD A METRO STATION IN THE CITY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS APART FROM THE METRO SYSTEM IN THE AIRPORT BEING CLOSED E.U. INSTITUTIONS ARE ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID ON TWITTER
THAT HIS THOUGHTS ARE WITH PEOPLE IN BRUSSELS IN THE U.K. WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT IT CAN IT'S NOW A QUARTER TO NINE
THE INDIAN PARLIAMENT AS PART OF THE SPLENDID COMPLEX OF GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN DELHI BUILT IN COLONIAL TIMES AND NOW FOUND TO HAVE A TUNNEL RUNNING UNDERNEATH IT A SOUTH ASIA CORRESPONDENT JUSTIN ROLLER HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING HE JOINS A SOUND IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS ONCE USED FOR A PRETTY GRISLY PURPOSE JUST
IT WAS INDEED IN FACT THIS ISN'T THE MAIN GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS OF TELLY THAT I'M OUTSIDE I'M OUTSIDE THE DELI CITY ASSEMBLY IT IN THE SESSION AS WE SPEAK SO IT WAS ACTUALLY EARLIER THIS MORNING THAT I WENT DOWN INTO THE TUNNEL
SO WE'VE COME INTO A MAGNIFICENT COLONIAL ERA BUILDING PAINTED WHITE VERY GRAND AND INSIDE HERE
AND OLD WITH BEAUTIFUL WORD THIS WAS THE ORIGINAL PARLIAMENT FOR INDIA THAT WHEN THE BRITISH MOVED THE CAPITAL HERE TODAY IN NINETEEN ELEVEN AND THEN LATER ON IN THE TWENTIES IT BECAME A COURT HOUSE I'VE JUST COME INTO THE CHAMBER ITSELF THIS IS NOW THE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBER FOR FOR DELHI AND IT'S A SEMI CIRCULAR GRAND SEMI CIRCULAR ROOM WITH A HIGH CEILING GREEN CARPET
LOMON TREE FEEL TO IT AND AS WE'RE WALKING THROUGH I CAN SEE THEY PEEL BACK THE CARPET AND THERE'S A HATCH THERE WHICH HAS BEEN OPENED AND WE'RE JUST WALKING TOWARDS IT NOW INSIDE IS THIS MYSTERIOUS TUNNEL
I'M JOINED HERE BY THIS BEAKER YES AND BEFORE I GO IN LET ME JUST ASK MY WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS TUNNEL
THIS WAS FOUR HUNDRED PRISONERS FROM RED FLOAT ON IT HAVE GONE FOR THIS
WHAT IF WE DON'T PLAY US THIS DELLA WAS YOURS RIGHT TO THE RED FORT WAS THE GARRISON WHERE THE BRITISH HELD AND THEY HELD THE PRISONERS AND THEY BROUGHT ME THROUGH THE CHANNEL TO OVERTURN UP INTO THIS WHICH WAS THEN USED AS A COURT TWENTY WAS USED AS A CALL WHERE DID THEY GO FROM HERE ON THEY WERE HANGED HERE THERE IS AT ALL SO THERE WAS A ROOM HERE WHAT RUMOUR IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE AND THEY WERE LED THERE
CAN I JUMP IN WHEN WE GO IN SO I'M JUST HANGING MY LEGS OVER THE EDGE OH HOO HERE WE GO INTO THE
AND DOWN HERE WOW O.K. SO IT'S NOT THAT DEEP IT'S ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FOOT DEEP IT'S GOT A SANDY BOTTOM AND LOOKING DOWN I CAN SEE IT STRETCHING AWAY UNDER THE CHAMBER OF THE PARLIAMENT
NOW IT'S GOT A WONDERFUL DAMP SMELL IT'S BRICK AND LINED WITH CONCRETE IN SOME PLACES QUITE SUBSTANTIAL
QUITE SMALL VERY MYSTERIOUS
WELL BACK IN DAYLIGHT AND I'M JOINED BY WILLIAM DALRYMPLE WHO IS AUTHOR OF MANY FINE BOOKS ABOUT INDIAN HISTORY WILLIE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS THIS GHOULISH TALE OF FREEDOM FIGHTERS BEING BROUGHT TO THEIR DEATH
WHAT'S QUITE CERTAIN IS THAT TRIAL TOOK PLACE IN THIS BUILDING IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES THAT FREEDOM FIGHTERS IF THEY'D BEEN CONVICTED OF VIOLENT OFFENCES WHERE NO DOUBT SEVENTH TO DEATH
BUT I HAD TO SET A BIT SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE THE FOUR MILE TUNNEL TO THE RED BOOK BECAUSE WE ARE A FULL SIX AND A HALF KILOMETRES
FROM THE FROM THE RED FORT HERE AND THERE ARE SIMPLY NO REASON FOR THE BRITISH TO HAVE TO BUILD THEM A SIX KILOMETRE LONG TUNNEL DO TO BRING THE TROUT THERE THE PRISONERS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS I'M ALSO SCEPTICAL ABOUT MY SET ABOUT A GALLOWS IN THE COURTROOM BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HUNG IN THE RED FORT AND IF THEY HAD TO BE
WHAT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN UPRISING THIS LOVELY AREA THAT WE'RE IN TODAY WITH BUT LAWNS AND BEAUTIFUL GARDENS AND PARLIAMENTARIANS WALKING BACKWARDS AND FORTH
WAS IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN A BURNT OUT WASTELAND AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN OF COURSE THE INDIAN MUTINY OR THE INDIANS CALL IT THE FIRST WAR OF INDIAN INDEPENDENCE THE LARGEST ANTI COLONIAL REVOLT TAKE PLACE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD IN THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THE COLONIAL
A VERY BLOODY AND NASTY AFFAIR IT WAS WITH THE BRITISH UP ON THE RIDGE BEHIND US
THE REBEL FORCES LED BY THE MOGUL EMPEROR BEHIND SHOW THAT FOR IN THE RED FORT AND THIS AREA THE CIVIL LINES WAS WHERE THE
REBEL SEPOYS HAD WALKED IN AN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN THEY'D MURDERED ALL THE BRITISH OFFICIALS HE'S BURNT OUT BUNGALOWS WHERE THEY WERE BEING USED FOR TUNNELLING AND COUNTED SOMETHING LIKE THE FIRST WERE WHAT HE WANTS IN BIRDSONG AND REMEMBER THOSE PICTURES OF THE TUNNELS IT WAS LIKE THAT SO POSSIBLY A LEGACY OF THAT PERIOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WILLIAM WILLIAM DALRYMPLE AND OF COURSE THERE IS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IT COULD OF COURSE BE JUST SOME KIND OF CELLAR BENEATH THE BUILDING SOME HISTORICAL MYSTERIES ARE NEVER SOLVED
THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST ENROL AT A SOUTH ASIA CORRESPONDENT IT'S NOW TEN TO NINE THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE B. B. C.
