CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS STARTING WITH THE TELEGRAPH LAST NIGHT'S I.T.V. A DEBATE BETWEEN DAVID CAMERON NIGEL FARAGE IS ON THE FRONT PAGE BUT THE MAIN STORY COMES FROM COMMENTS AT THE TRANSPORT SECRETARY PATRICK MCLOUGHLIN MADE TO THE LONDON EVENING STANDARD ARE SUGGESTING THAT DIESEL DRIVERS WILL BE HIT BY TAX RISES IN ORDER TO CUT
POLLUTION THE TELEGRAPHS HEADLINE DIESEL CAR DRIVERS FACE TOXIC FUMES ATTACKS PATTERN WOULD LACHLAN SAID THAT RAISING THE DUTIES IS SOMETHING THE CHANCELLOR WILL NEED TO LOOK OUT TO REDUCE TOXIC LEVELS OF NITROGEN OXIDES AND PREVENT DEATHS
IN CITIES THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY REJECTED CALLS FOR A DIESEL SCRAPPAGE SCHEME TO INCENTIVISE DRIVERS TO TRADE IN DIESEL CARS INSTEAD THE TRANSPORT SECRETARY HAS SAID THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS WERE DRESSING IT THROUGH THERE A TRAIL THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT'S AIR QUALITY STRATEGY IT WAS SIR GORDON BROWN WHO CUT LOW SULPHUR DIESEL DUTY BY TWO THOUSAND BY THREE
HENCE IN HIS TWO THOUSAND ONE BUDGET WHEN HE WAS CHANCELLOR AND THE NUMBER OF DIESELS VEHICLES ROSE SHARPLY SO ANY DECISION TO INCREASE YOUR DUTY AGAIN SAYS THE TELEGRAPH WOULD BE MADE BY GEORGE OSBORNE IN A FUTURE BUDGET ON THE T.V. DEBATE THERE WASN'T REALLY A DEBATE LAST NIGHT ANYTHING IN IT I REALLY HAS THE FRONT PAGE THE DAVID CAMERON WOULD HAVE HOPE FOR HIM AND NIGEL FARAGE PHOTOGRAPH THE HEADLINE CAMERON GLASS LITTLE ENGLAND MENTALITY THE TIMES REPORTS
BUT THE LEAVE SIDE MISTER FARRELL'S USED THE T. V. CONTEST TO RENEW HIS SEX ATTACK CLAIM THE SUGGESTION THAT A COLOGNE EXPERIENCE WHAT I'M TO NEW YEAR'S EVE OF COURSE FOR THOSE SIX ATTACKS COULD HAPPEN HERE THE GUARDIAN REPORTS THE BRICKS IT TEAM IN THE SHAPE OF GO VAN JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO FROM BORIS JOHNSON A CHALLENGING CAMERON TO A PROPER T.V. DEBATE IN OTHER WORDS NOT SIMPLY FOLLOWING EACH OTHER INTO A STUDIO BUT FACE TO FACE BUT WHAT IS MOST STRIKING I THINK ABOUT THE PAPERS THIS MORNING IS THAT THE CAMPAIGNERS FOR OUT THE DAILY MAIL AND THE SUN
I DON'T WANNA REPORT REALLY ON THE DEBATE AT ALL THEY WANNA KEEP IMMIGRATION IN THE NEWS THE MAIL'S FRONT PAGE WHAT A WAY TO TACKLE THE MIGRANT CRISIS IS ITS HEADLINE CLAIMING THAT BRUSSELS WANTS TO DO IT BY INVESTING INVITING QUOTES YET MORE PEOPLE INTO THE Y. U. THE SUN'S HEADLINE CHECKPOINT CHARLIES REPORTING ON A EUROPEAN COURT ORDER WHICH IT CLAIMS MEANT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A WOMAN CAUGHT WITH A FAKE PASSPORT AT THE CHANNEL TUNNEL TO BE DETAINED
THE TIME IS TEN PAST SIX AFTER MONTHS OF BATTLING BERNIE SANDRA'S IN THE LAST FEW HOURS HILLARY CLINTON WAS ABLE TO DECLARE THAT SHE HAS SECURED THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SIX STATES HAVE BEEN VOTING IN PRIMARIES ARE FOUR OF THEM HAVE NOW DECLARED MISSUS CLINTON WON NEW MEXICO NEW JERSEY AND SOUTH DAKOTA WELL NORTH DAKOTA HAS GONE TO BERNIE'S SANDERSON HERE'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT WE CAN'T
WE HAVE TO BE AS BIG AS THE VALUES THAT DEFINE AMERICA AND WE ARE
A BIT THE HARD EARNED FAIR MINDED COUNTRY
WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN DAD THIS IS ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE
I ASKED OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO POOL FOR HIS ASSESSMENT OF HOW HILLARY CLINTON SOUNDED RELIEVED ECSTATIC THERE WAS A VERY MUCH DIFFERENT TONE IN THE WAY SHE SPOKE TO THE AUDIENCE INSTEAD OF ATTACKING BERNIE SANDERS SHE WAS PRAISING HIM ABOUT THE BRILLIANT CAMPAIGN HE'D THOUGHT AND OF COURSE ALL HER FIRE TRAINED ON DONALD TRUMP ABOUT HOW HE WAS TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT
TO BE PRESIDENT YOU KIND OF GOT THE PHASE ONE OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS OVER DEALING WITH BERNIE SANDRA'S FACE TO JUST BEGINNING HOW TO DEAL WITH DONALD TRUMP
ARE YOU THEREFORE NOW EXPECTING A STATEMENT FROM SENATOR SAUNDERS THERE'LL BE A STATEMENT FROM SENATOR SANDERS BUT WHAT IT WILL BE REMAIN SOMETHING OF A MYSTERY HILLARY CLINTON IS STILL TOO DEPENDENT ON THESE SO CALLED SUPER DELICATE THESE ARE THE KIND OF
DEMOCRATIC PARTY GRANDEES WHO ARE NOT PLEDGED TO ANYONE THEY CAN VOTE HOW THEY WANT AND BERNIE SANDERS THINKS THAT'S UNDEMOCRATIC AND ALL THE TIME THAT HE THINKS THAT HE'S GOT A LOT OF DELEGATES THAT HE'S AMASSED OVER THE COURSE OF THIS LOVE A BRUISING CAMPAIGN I THINK HE MIGHT WANT TO CARRY ON THE FIGHT BUT SHE TURNED HER SIGHTS ON DONALD TRUMP INCREASINGLY HOW IS HER CAMPAIGN HER TONE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THIS POINT ON
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE AND I THINK THAT WHAT IS CLEAR TO ME FROM HAVING SPOKEN TO MANY OF THE SENIOR PEOPLE AROUND HILLARY CLINTON IS THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO FIGHT DONALD TRUMP THEY CAN'T LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THINGS AND DICTATE THE TERMS OF DEBATE BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE ANXIOUS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T
GET INTO THE GUTTER AND KIND OF START TRADING INSULTS AS IF THAT IS THE WAY TO WIN THE ELECTION THE MOST STRIKING THING ABOUT THIS ELECTION IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING DATA ON BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP
HUGELY HIGH NEGATIVES I'M FAVOURITE BLITZY RATINGS AND SO HILLARY CLINTON SOMEHOW HAS TO START REBUILDING POPULARITY WHILST AT THE SAME TIME HOPING TO DAMAGE DONALD TRUMP JOHN'S OPAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I KNOW HE'S THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX SHE WAS SEEN IN A NIGHT CLUB IN BATH TWENTY YEARS AGO THIS WEEK AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE SAY THAT NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN D.N.A. PROFILING COULD HELP THEM TO CATCH THE KILLER OF MELANIE HALL WHO WAS TWENTY FIVE IT TOOK THIRTEEN YEARS TO FIND HER BODY IN WOODLAND NEAR THE M. FIVE MOTORWAY ARE WEST OF ENGLAND CORRESPONDENT JOHN KAY JONES IS ON THE LINE AND CAN TELL US MORE REMINDERS JOHN THE BACKGROUND TO THIS CASE PLEASE
NICK IT WAS JUNE NINETEEN NINETY SIX MELANIE HALL IN HER TWENTIES WENT TO A NIGHTCLUB CALLED CADILLACS IN BATH OR CLOSE TO WHERE SHE LIVED WITH HER FAMILY AND SOMEHOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW BUT SOMEHOW SHE BECAME SEPARATED FROM HER FRIENDS AND SHE WAS NEVER SEEN ALIVE AGAIN
OVER THE YEARS AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE HAVE TAKEN SIXTEEN HUNDRED STATEMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ON THIS BUT OFFICERS STILL DON'T KNOW HOW MELANIE LEFT THAT CLUB
OR WHO SHE WAS WITH WHAT THEY DO KNOW IS THAT THIRTEEN YEARS AFTER SHE VANISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE HER BODY WAS FOUND WRAPPED IN BIN BAGS AND RUN
IN A STRETCH OF WOODLAND NEXT TO THE M. FIVE IN SOUTH GLOUCESTERSHIRE WHICH IS ABOUT THIRTY MILES DRIVE
SO TODAY TO MARK THIS TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF HER DISAPPEARANCE AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE RENEWING THEIR APPEAL FOR INFORMATION AND THEY CONFIRM FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY DO HAVE SOME D.N.A. EVIDENCE FROM AN ITEM THAT THEY WERE COVERED WITH MELANIE'S REMAINS AND THEY SAY THAT GIVES THEM HOPE THAT THIS COULD NOW BE A SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH
THAT THEY AND HER FAMILY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR WAS OVER THE YEARS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED ON THIS BUT SO FAR NOBODY HAS BEEN CHARGED AND YOUR MOISES COME TO LIGHT NOW AFTER SO MANY YEARS
IT SEEMS THEY'VE HAD THIS D.N.A. MATERIAL SINCE THEY FOUND MELANIE'S BODY SEVEN YEARS AGO BUT IT IS ONLY NOW WITH RECENT ADVANCES IN FORENSIC SCIENCE AT THEY SAY THEY CAN ACTUALLY USE IT TO BUILD UP WHAT THEY CALL A D.N.A. PROFILE
THAT'S GOING ON IN THE LABS AT THE MOMENT MELANIE'S PARENTS STEVE AND PAT HALL HAVE WELCOMED THIS DEVELOPMENT THEY'VE ALREADY HAD TO WAIT TWO DECADES FOR JUSTICE AND EXPLAIN TO US WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO HAVE SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO IT WAS AND WHY I MIGHT LEAVE HER IN SUCH A
I DON'T KNOW A RIDICULOUS PLACE BY THE SIDE OF A MOTORWAY IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO ME BUT WE DO FEEL WE WANT SOMEONE FIND AND SOMEONE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE A MAN ON HIS BEHALF
IT WON'T TAKE THE HORROR IN HEARTACHE AWAY FROM US YOU KNOW THAT HE'S WITH US TO OUR DYING DAY
THE HALL'S SO THEY'RE CONFIDENT THEY WILL GET JUSTICE BECAUSE THEY POINT TO THE FACT THAT ONLY LAST MONTH A MAN CALLED CHRISTOPHER HAMPTON WAS CONVICTED OF THE MURDER THREE DECADES AGO DUE TO ADVANCES IN D.N.A. INTRIGUINGLY CHRISTOPHER HAMPTON WAS ALSO FROM
HE WAS CONVICTED OF KILLING ANOTHER MELANIE MELANIE ROAD IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BUT DETECTIVE SENT TO GO THEY'RE NOT LINKING THE TWO CASES IN THE FACT THEY SAY THEY DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL DECIDE TO TIE THE UNSOLVED MURDER OF MELANIE HALL TWENTY YEARS AGO TO ANY OTHER MURDER OR SEXUAL OFFENCE EITHER IN THIS AREA OR IN ANYWHERE ELSE
O.K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIXTY MINUTES PAST SIX M.P.S WILL DELVE DEEPER INTO THE COLLAPSE OF BRITISH HOME STORES TODAY BUSINESS NEWS WITH ROBBIE OD MORNING ROB MORNING YES LATER TODAY WE'LL HEAR FROM THE MAN WHOSE COMPANY BOUGHT B.H.S. FOR ONE POUND THAT LAST YEAR DOMINIC S'APPELLE USED TO BE A RACING DRIVER HAD BEEN BANKRUPT THREE TIMES AND HAD NO RETAIL EXPERIENCE AT THE TYCOON SIR PHILIP GREEN SOLD HIM B.H.S.
DESPITE HIS EARLIER CONCERNS DOMINIC IS BEING BLAMED BY THE MANAGEMENT OF B.H.S. FOR THE FIRM'S DEMISE OF TWO ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS WILL BE LOST AND PENSIONERS FACE LOSING TEN PER CENT OF THEIR RETIREMENT INCOME IN A LETTER TO STAFF THE B.H.S. OPERATIONS TEAM SAYS DOMINIC'S REPELS RETAIL ACQUISITIONS STARVED B.H.S. HAVE THE FUNDS THEY NEEDED TO TURN THEIR BUSINESS AROUND
CENTRAL FINANCIERS TOLD M.P.S LATE YESTERDAY THEY WALKED AWAY FROM FUNDING THE PURCHASE OF B.H.S. BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE PENSION FUND AND NERVOUSNESS ABOUT MY NICK LIKE YORK RUNS FOR ALAN CAPITAL EUROPE
BANKRUPTCIES IN OF ITSELF THE HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS JUST MEANT THAT THIS WAS NOT THE PERSON THAT WE WOULD EVER CONSIDER
CONSIDER IT TO BE SINGING IT WOULD LEND MONEY
YEAH FROM ONE INTERESTING DETAIL WE LEARNT WAS THIS STRESS OF DRIER FROM THE LENDER RIVER ROCK CLAIMS DOMINIC'S S'APPELLE KNEW SIR PHILIP GREEN SOCIALLY
HE'S INTO ME ARSE ON THE RADIO PLACES THAT HE WAS ON A FIRST NAME BASIS WITH SIR PHILIP AND HIS WIFE
THEY HAD BEEN THERE HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE BEEN A RECLAIMER MANY TIMES I WAS
AND THAT THAT'S WHERE THAT CAME FROM THE TEAM THAT IS THAT BEEN HORSES THAT SOCIAL INTERACTION IN MONACO THE
THIS OPPORTUNITY CAME UP WILL DOMINIC'S APPELLE AHEAD OF RETAIL ACQUISITIONS WILL GIVE HIS SIDE OF THE STORY TO EM PEAS LATER TODAY WITH US IS BRIAN ROBERTS HAS THE WONDERFUL TITLE OF INSIGHT DIRECTOR AT THE RETAIL CONSULTANT TK GLOBAL MORNING BRIAN SAID YOU GIVE HER GIVE US AN INSIGHT AND THERE WHAT WE JUST HEARD IT SEEMS WE'RE IN LINE FOR A MASSIVE ROUND OF FINGER POINTING TODAY IT SEEMS THAT THE FINANCES ALREADY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM
RETAIL I IS LIMITED AND WITH AS YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THE ACTUAL OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS OR BLAME ISCHIA POWELL FOR TAKING MONEY OUT THE BUSINESS NOT PUTTING ENOUGH BACK IN TERMS OF INVESTING IN THE STORES UNTIL YOU'RE TAKING APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO TURN B.H.S. INTO A MORE COMPETITIVE RETAILER AND HAS ALREADY INTIMATED THAT YOU HAVE THE GREEN MIGHT BE AT FAULT NOT NECESSARILY
CONTRIBUTING ENOUGH ON THE HANDOVER OF THE OF THE BUSINESS AND ACTUALLY THAT HE WAS ASSUMING THAT GREMA TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF THEIR DEBT AND THAT BIG PENSIONS BLACK HOLE
THE MANAGEMENT OF B.H.S. HAVE SAID THAT THEY COULDN'T TURN THEIR BUSINESS AROUND WITHOUT LOTS OF MONEY THE SUMS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NEEDED WOULD BE HUGE INDEED I MEAN IT WAS STARVED OF INVESTMENT UNDER SIR PHILIP GREEN AS WELL YOU KNOW IT WAS THE STORE STATE WAS INCREDIBLY INCONSISTENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A THE RETAIL BUSINESS OPERATING ON FOUR DIFFERENT LOGOS WHICH AND I SUGGEST JUST HOW DESPERATE THE STORE BASE WASN'T LACKING IN AREAS LIKE THAT THE ACTUAL RANGES THE INSTORE ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO IMPORTANTLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE
ONLINE AS WELL SO ANYONE TAKING OVER THE BUSINESS EVEN WITH VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED FUNDS WOULD HAVE HAD FACED A BIG CHALLENGE BUT A PIP SOMEONE TAKING OVER THE BUSINESS WITH VIRTUALLY NO LIQUIDITY TO PUT BACK INTO IT IS VIRTUALLY MISSION IMPOSSIBLE HAVE YOU ADMINISTRATORS ARE STILL LOOKING FOR BUYERS FALL ANY OR ALL PARTS OF THE B.H.S. BUSINESS EVEN AS THEY WIND IT UP IS THERE A LOT OF DEMAND FOR THE STALLS
WHICH WHICH ARE ON THE SELLING BLOCK YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE B.H.S. HAS ALREADY HAD SOME OF ITS PRIME REAL ESTATE CARVED OFF PRIMARK TOOK A BATCH OF STORES MANY MANY YEARS AGO HE NEVER FRY MARK MIGHT BE INTERESTED SPORTS DIRECT MATALAN THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF RETAIL BUSINESS EVEN SOME OF THE BIG DISCOUNT IS LIKE BEING THERE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SOME OF THE SIGHTS
BUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE DEBRIS THAT'S FILM INCREDIBLE MY SYMPATHY FOR ELEVEN THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC YOU MIGHT BE FACING EXTREME UNCERTAINTY OR SADLY UNEMPLOYMENT THANKS BRIAN BRIAN ROBERTS THERE FROM TK GLOBAL BOTHER THE B.H.S. PENSIONS FUND IS BEING REVIEWED BY THE INDUSTRY LIFEBOAT THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND THE REGULATORS ALSO LOOKING INTO WHETHER THE FORMER OWNERS DOMINIC'S SIR PHILIP GREEN SHOULD HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE MONEY TO FILL THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUND BLACK HOLE
INDUSTRY FIGURES WARNING IT COULD TAKE YEARS TO SORT THAT ISCHIA OUT IF IT GOES TO COURT WILL BE INDEPENDENT PENSIONS EXPERT JOHN RALPH IS ADVISING THE COMMONS WORK AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE'S INQUIRY INTO B.H.S. MORNING JOHN GOOD MORNING SO IT SEEMS THAT PENSIONERS AND COULD BE IN LIMBO FOR FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NO I DON'T THINK THAT'S QUITE RIGHT BECAUSE THE TWENTY THOUSAND PENSION SCHEME MEMBERS WENT INTO THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND THE BEGINNING OF MARCH WHATEVER HAPPENS THEY WILL GET RECEIVE COMPENSATION IN LINE WITH THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND
NOT AS GENEROUS AS THE UNDERLYING PENSION PROMISE BUT BUT NOT FAR OFF AND END TO END LOSS OF ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT
BUT IF THE BLACK HOLE IS HIS PHIL ULTIMATELY THEY COULD SILVIO WHAT ANOTHER TEN PER CENT OF THEIR PENSIONS AND IF AN AMOUNT OF MONEY IS FOUND FROM SOMEWHERE AND SOMEWHERE IN THIS CASE OBVIOUSLY IS IS THE HOLDING COMPANY TAFFETA AND THAT AMOUNT IS MORE THAN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THEY COULD GET A LITTLE BIT MORE VAN
THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND COMPENSATION BUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT'S REQUIRED TO KEEP THEM ABSOLUTELY HOLE IS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS THAT'S BEEN OFTEN QUOTED RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ADVISING THIS COMMITTEE OF M.P.S HOW ABOUT YOU GIVE HER A BIT OF ADVICE TO THE FORMER OWNERS WHAT SHOULD THEY DO ON THE PENSIONS ISSUE IN YOUR VIEW WELL I THINK THERE'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD WHEN I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS MY PERSONAL PERSONAL POINT HAVE YOU NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COMMITTEE THERE'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY FOR FIRST
TO SQUARE THE B.H.S. PENSION CIRCLE MAKES EVERYONE HAPPY IT RESTORES SIR PHILIP REPUTATION FOR FAIR DEALING IT WOULD MEAN THAT THE PENSION REGULATOR WOULD WOULD STOP THE INVESTIGATION AGAINST SIR PHILIP AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT TRAVELLED TO THE FORMER HOLDING COMPANY WOULD SET UP A NEW PENSION SCHEME
MEMBERS IN THE B.H.S. PENSION SCHEMES WOULD BE GIVEN THE CHOICE TO TRANSFER TO THAT NEW PENSION SCHEME WITH A FULL PENSION ENTITLEMENT TO FILL IT WOULD PUT IN THE EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS THAT HE SAID HE'S PREPARED TO PUT IN THERE WOULD THEN BE ANOTHER VALUATION AND THAT I THINK WOULD THROW UP ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DEFICIT THAT WILL BE PAID OFF
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE NORMAL WAY SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS RIGHT O.K. THANK YOU JOHN JOHN RALPH HE'S ADVISING ME COMMONS WORK AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE ON MARKETS GUESS THIS MORNING IS JAMES BEVAN CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE AT C. L. A.

A PEOPLE TRAFFICKER WHO'S BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO ITALY READ MADE HONEY AND THEY WERE TRAY AND KNOWN AS THE GENERAL WAS TRACKED DOWN TO SUDAN BY THE U.K.'S NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS CONGRATULATED HILLARY CLINTON FOR SECURING THE SUPPORT NEEDED TO BECOME THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE AFTER WINNING THE PRIMARIES IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW MEXICO MISSUS CLINTON SANCTUS SUPPORTERS FOR HELPING HER TO BECOME THE FIRST WOMAN TO BE NOMINATED BY A MAJOR PARTY
THE I.P.C.C. HAS CRITICISED POLICE OFFICERS IN SUSSEX FOR USING HANDCUFFS LEG RESTRAINTS AND A SPIT HOOD ON AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL WITH A SEVERE NEUROLOGICAL DISABILITY IN TWENTY TWELVE SHE WAS HELD IN CUSTODY ON FOUR OCCASIONS FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY HOURS SUSSEX POLICE SAID THAT ALL OFFICERS HAD BEEN GIVEN NEW TRAINING TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS
AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE SAY THEY HOPE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN D.N.A. PROFILING WILL HELP CATCH THE KILLER OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DISAPPEARED IN BATH TWENTY YEARS AGO MELANIE HALL WAS LAST SEEN ALIVE AT A NIGHTCLUB
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT TALKING ON A HANDS FREE PHONE WHILE DRIVING CAN BE JUST AS DISTRACTING AS HOLDING A MOBILE PHONE RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX FOUND THAT MOTORISTS HAVING CONVERSATIONS ON THE PHONE OFTEN FAILED TO SPOT HAZARDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND THE HEAD OF THE CONSORTIUM THAT BOUGHT B.H.S. FOR A POUND DOMINIC WILL APPEAR BEFORE M.P.S TODAY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT IT COLLAPSE LETTER FROM B.H.S. MANAGERS YESTERDAY ACCUSED HIM OF FAILING TO RAISE THE FUNDS THAT HE HAD PROMISED
IT IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NEXT CHARLES IT WAS THE CLOSEST DAVID CAMERON WILL GET TO A DEBATE ON EUROPE UNLESS OF COURSE HE CHANGES HIS MIND IT WAS OF COURSE NOT REALLY A DEBATE AT ALL THE PRIME MINISTER CAME FACE TO FACE WITH THE PUBLIC IN I.T.V. STUDIO LAST NIGHT NOT WITH BORIS JOHNSON OR MICHAEL GO APPEARING BEFORE HIM WAS THE MAN HE WOULD LIKE TO BE SEEN AS THE LEADER OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN NIGEL FARRAJ THE LEADER OF UKIP
BEGAN BY DECLARING THAT THE EXPERTS HAD BEEN WRONG IN THE PAST AND THEY WERE WRONG NOW THE HE SAID BEING A MEMBER OF THE E.U. OUTWEIGHED ANY BENEFITS TO THE U.K. WELL LET'S JUST SAY THEY DECIDE TO CUT OFF THEIR NOSE TO SPITE THEIR FACE WITH THEIR BIGGEST EXPORT MARKET IN THE WORLD
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IF THEY PUT TARIFFS ON US THOSE TARIFFS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN OLD NET FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION SO NO DEAL IS BETTER THAN THE ROTTEN DEAL THAT WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT
THAT CONCESSION THAT THERE WOULD BE TERRACE WAS ONE THAT DAVID CAMERON WOULD LATER SEIZE UPON NOW ANY PROGRAMME FEATURING MY FARRAJ IS LIKELY TO BE A PROGRAMME DOMINATED BY IMMIGRATION ACCUSED OF SCAREMONGERING FOR IMPLYING THAT THE KIND OF SEX ATTACKS PERPETRATED ON WOMEN IN COLOGNE BY MIGRANTS COULD MAYBE WOULD HAPPEN IN THE U.K. HE INSISTED FIRST THAT THE MEDIA HEADLINES WERE MISLEADING AND THEN THAT THIS WAS AND I QUOTE A TIDDLY LITTLE ISSUE
NEXT TO FACE THE CHARGE THAT WHAT ONE MEMBER OF THE AUDIENCE CALLED ANTI IMMIGRATION RACISM WOULD INCREASE FEAR AND DISCRIMINATION HIS REPLY BUT HE HAD STRONGLY PRO COMMONWEALTH VIEWS IF WE HAVE
AN AUSTRALIAN STYLE POINTS SYSTEM RATHER THAN AN OPEN DOOR TO FIVE HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE
THEN ACTUALLY IT WILL BE BETTER FOR BLACK PEOPLE COMING TO BRITAIN WHO CURRENTLY FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS OPEN DOOR
WHAT THEY WERE FOR THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE IF BRITAIN WERE TO LEAVE MY HOUSE PAINTED A PICTURE NOT JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE E.U. BUT OF A VERY DIFFERENT EUROPE
THE PROJECT DOESN'T WORK I WANT US
TO GET BACK OUR INDEPENDENCE BUT TO SAY WE'LL BE GOOD EUROPEANS WILL TRADE WITH EUROPE COOPERATE WITH EUROPE BUT GOVERN OURSELVES AND I BELIEVE WHEN WE DO
THE REST OF EUROPE WILL DO THAT TOO AND A HAPPY EUROPE WILL BE A DEMOCRATIC EUROPE OF SOVEREIGN STATES WHO WERE GOOD NEIGHBOURS IN THE SAME STREET NOW BOTH SIDES IN THIS CAMPAIGN SHARE ONE PRETTY SIMPLE VIEW IF THE DEBATE IS DOMINATED BY THE ECONOMY REMAIN HIS WINNING IT'S DOMINATED BY IMMIGRATION LEAVE IS THE PRIME MINISTER WHEN HE CAME TO THE STUDIO WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE COST OF LEAVING THE E.U. IS QUESTION AS CHOSEN BY I. T. V. PREFERRED TO QUIZ HIM ON THE IMPACT OF CONTINUING FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
I HAVE NO G.P. AS ALL UP FULL IN MY AREA I CAN'T GET ONTO THE HOUSING LADDER AND HAVE THREE KIDS IN ONE ROOM THE PLACE WHERE I GREW UP IS NOW WHAT'S A LOVELY AREA BUT IS NOW A NO GO ZONE
HOW IS THE E.U. AND UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION WORKING FOR ME A FORTY YEAR OLD BRIT WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING FULL TIME SINCE THE AGE OF SIXTEEN DOING HIS BEST TO GET BACK TO THE ECONOMY MY CAMERON SAID THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WAS A BAD WAY TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION THE GOOD WAY HE SAID WAS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME AND WORK BUT TO MAKE THEM PAY INTO THE SYSTEM BEFORE THEY GOT MONEY OUT
I WOULD SAY REALLY FRANKLY THAT I THINK IF WE WANT TO BUILD HOUSES IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR A HEALTH SERVICE GOOD SCHOOLS FOR OUR CHILDREN WE'VE GOT TO STRENGTHEN AND SAFEGUARD OUR ECONOMY AND PULLING OUT OF THE SINGLE MARKET WHICH IS WHAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WHAT TO DO THAT WOULD DAMAGE OUR ECONOMY
GRANTED THE LAST WORD THE PRIME MINISTER SOUGHT TO TURN THIS INTO THE CONTEST BUT HE HAS ALWAYS WANTED BETWEEN WHAT HE CALLS A GREAT BRITAIN IN THE E.U. AND WHAT HE SAYS IS NIGEL FARAGE IS LITTLE ENGLAND
WE NEED TO BE IN THIS ORGANISATION FIGHTING FOR BRITISH INTERESTS AND FOR BRITISH JOBS LEAVING IT'S QUITS
I DON'T THINK BRITAIN I DON'T THINK WERE QUITTERS I THINK YOU'RE A FIGHTER FIGHT IN THESE ORGANISATIONS TRIPLE WHAT IF WE THINK IT'S RIGHT LISTENING WATCHING TO THAT OF COURSE NORMAN SMITH OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR A WORD WITH YOU ABOUT REGISTRATION IN A MOMENT NORMAN COS THERE'D BEEN PROBLEMS THERE BUT WHAT OVERALL DO YOU THINK WAS THE VERDICT OF THE WESTMINSTER BUBBLE AS IT WERE OF THIS DEBATE AND WHO WON
I THINK MOST PEOPLE AT THE END OF THE DAY WERE TAKE THE VIEW IT CONFIRMED THE CENTRAL TRUTH OF THIS REFERENDUM WHICH IS SIMPLY THIS OF THIS IS A REFERENDUM ABOUT THE ECONOMY MY CAMERON WINS AT THIS IS A REFERENDUM ABOUT IMMIGRATION MY CAMERON LOSES BECAUSE ON THE ECONOMY WHICH WAS CLEARLY THE ISSUE MISTER CAMERON WANTED TO FOCUS ON IT KEPT COMING BACK TO THE SINGLE MARKET THE BENEFITS IT BRINGS HE CITED YOU KNOW NINE OUT OF TEN ECONOMIST THEY WERE BETTER OFF IN THE POINTED TO ALL THESE
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE I.M.F. CAUTIONED US AGAINST LEAVING WARNED ABOUT THE IMPACT ON OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN THAT'S ALL SAFE COMFORTABLE TERRITORIES ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH THAT THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU MOVE ON TO IMMIGRATION
HE'S ON MUCH MORE THIN ICE AND THE QUESTIONS WHICH GET TRACTION ARE LIKE THAT ONE WE JUST PLAYED ABOUT THE MAN HE'S BEEN WORKING SINCE SIXTEEN CAN'T GET HOUSES KIDS LIVING THREE TO A ROOM IT'S COMMUNITIES A NO GO AREA AND HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THEM ON THE NUMBERS QUESTION AND HE'S FORCED REALLY INTO JUST SAYING WILL LOOK
THE ECONOMY MITIGATES SOME OF THE PRESSURES AND YOU SENSE THAT THAT IS NOT THE ANSWER THAT HIS CRITICS ON IMMIGRATION IN THE PUBLIC WANT AND HE IS VULNERABLE ON THAT AND THAT IS THE BASIC DYNAMIC OF THIS REFERENDUM
VERY QUICK WORD ON REGISTRATION IF YOU WEREN'T GOOD NEWS IS LOTS OF PEOPLE DID IT BAD NEWS IS THE SYSTEM CRASHED I MEAN AFTER ALL THE SORT OF PLEASE FOR PEOPLE TO REGISTER THEY DULY DID I THINK SOMETHING LIKE HALF A MILLION TRIED TO HER YESTERDAY AND ONE FIVE MINUTE PERIOD OF PLANETS LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND TRIED TO AND LO AND BEHOLD A COMPUTER SYSTEM SEEM TO
BUCKLE UNDER THE STRAIN NOW THERE ARE CALLS TO EXTEND THEIR REGISTRATION PERIOD TIM FARRON JEREMY CORBIN SAYING LOOK EXTEND IT BY A DAY NOT HEARD FROM THE CABINET OFFICE ON WHETHER THEY WILL DO THAT BUT I SUSPECT THAT IS QUITE LIKELY TO BE SOMETHING MISTER CORBIN BRINGS UP A PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION HAS REPRIMANDED SUSSEX POLICE AFTER INVESTIGATING THE WAY THE FORCE DEALT WITH AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL WITH A SEVERE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER DANNY SURE OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT JOINS US HOW DID THEY DEAL WITH HER DANNY
WHAT THEY DID ON FIVE OCCASIONS BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND MARCH TWENTY TWELVE WAS TO ARREST THIS GUY THREE TIMES FOR MINOR OFFENCES AND ON ONE OCCASION DETAIN HER UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT AND THERE WERE TWO CLEAR FAILINGS THAT THE I.P.C.C. FOUND FIRST OF ALL WHEN THE GIRL WAS DETAINED IN CUSTODY HE WASN'T ALLOWED ACCESS TO AN APPROPRIATE ADULT THAT'S A PARENT GUARDIAN OR SOCIAL WORKER
AND THE I.P.C.C. ALSO FOUND THAT WHEN POLICE DEALT WITH HER THEY USED HANDCUFFS LEG RESTRAINTS AND SPIT HOODS OR SPIT GUARDS THESE ARE COVERINGS THAT ARE PUT OVER THEIR FACE TO STOP SPIT COMING FROM THE GIRL TO ONTO POLICE
BUT THEY DID NOT RECORD ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS THE REASONS FOR THE USE OF FORCE SO THOSE WERE THE TWO KEY FAILINGS NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE BY THE I.P.C.C. AND AS A RESULT THEY RECOMMENDED THAT ELEVEN OFFICERS HAD A CASE TO ANSWER FOR MISCONDUCT NINE OF THE OFFICERS HAVE RECEIVED MANAGEMENT DEVICE TO HAVE SINCE RETIRED MANAGEMENT ADVICE DOESN'T SOUND TERRIBLY
IT'S THE SORT OF BOTTOM FORM OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION I THINK THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IMPROVING PROCEDURES AND TRAINING FOR POLICE THOSE WITH THERE WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT
OR STEPS TO COME FROM THE FINDINGS OF THIS REPORT AND SUSSEX POLICE HAS TAKEN EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY MADE A NUMBER OF CHANGES IN A SUIT A VERY DETAILED STATEMENT IN WHICH THEY'VE OUTLINED THE MEASURES THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN AS A RESULT AND THE FAMILY OF THE GIRL
WHERE THEY ARE UNDERSTANDABLY SHOCKED AT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE GIRL'S MOTHER METAL A WITNESSED SOME OF THE RESTRAINTS THAT WERE USED AGAINST HER DAUGHTER AND SAID THAT SHE FOUND THE BEHAVIOUR DISGUSTING
IT'S CAN'T GET THE IMAGES OUT OF HER MIND OF THIS ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO HAD SEVERE MENTAL PROBLEMS AND WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND I THINK THE GIRL'S MOTHER ACCEPTS THAT HER BEHAVIOUR WAS VERY CHALLENGING BUT SHE CAN'T GET THOSE IMAGES OF HER BEING PLACED IN A IN A SPIT IT OUT OF HER MIND AND IT WILL STAY WITH HER FOREVER SHE SAYS WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE GIRL'S LAWYER AND TO THE DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SUSSEX POLICE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME DANNY SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE PAPERS THIS MORNING THE FORMER CHELSEA DOCTOR EVA CANARY WAS ON SEVERAL FROM PAGES AFTER SETTLING HER UNFAIR DISMISSAL CASE WITH THE CLUB METRO SAYS CHELSEA SHOULD A GROVELLING APOLOGY FOR HER TREATMENT AFTER A PITCH SIDE ROW WITH THEIR THEN MANAGER JOSE MARIE AND IT CARRIES THE HEADLINE WE'RE EVEN SO SORRY EVER SO SORRY OF COURSE MARINO HUMILIATED IS THE DAILY EXPRESS HIS TAKE ON THE CASE
THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES PAID TO DOCTOR CANARY ISN'T KNOWN BUT THE MIRROR REPORTS A TWO MILLION POUND VICTORY WHAT IS THE DAILY MAIL NEVER SHORT OF A ADDED SOME SAYS CAN THIS INSULT BE WORTH FIVE MILLION POUNDS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WARNS THE DIESEL CAR DRIVERS COULD BE FACING WHAT IT CALLED THE TOXIC FUMES TAX IT FOLLOWS A SUGGESTION FROM THE TRANSPORT SECRETARY PATRICK MCLOUGHLIN THE DUTY ON THE FUEL WILL NEED TO RISE TO CUT POLLUTION OF NITROGEN OXIDES THERE ANY DECISION ON THAT WOULD NEED TO COME FROM THE CHANCELLOR
ACCORDING TO THE TIMES MISTER MCLAUCHLAN SAID IT WAS A MISTAKE FOR THE PREVIOUS LABOUR GOVERNMENT HAVE INCENTIVISED PEOPLE TO BUY DIESEL CARS AND HAVE ADVISED THAT THEY WERE BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN PETROL ONES IT REPORTS ANGER FROM MOTORING GROUPS WHO SAY IT'S UNFAIR THE DIESEL DRIVERS SHOULD PAY THE PRICE WHEN THEY BOUGHT THE CAR'S IN GOOD FAITH ON THE GOVERNMENT SAY SO WHAT THE SUN CALLS A SHOCK RULING BY THE EUROPEAN COURT HAS PROVOKED ANGER IN SOME OF THE PAPERS THE SUN SAYS A DECISION THAT IT WAS WRONG FOR FRENCH AUTHORITIES TO DETAIN HER GAR MAY AND WOMAN WITH A FAKE PASSPORT
THE CHANNEL TUNNEL WILL QUOTES OPEN THE FLOODGATES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THE TELEGRAPH SAYS IT MEANS POLICE FORCES ON THE CONTINENT MUST GIVE ILLEGAL MIGRANTS A MONTH TO GO HOME VOLUNTARILY WHICH IT BELIEVES WILL LEAVE THEM FREE TO MAKE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO ENTER THE U.K.
AND THERE ARE SOME UNEXPLAINED UNEXPECTED BENEFITS OF MARRIAGE FEATURED IN THE GUARDIAN WHICH LOOKS AT A U.K. STUDY SUGGESTING THAT MARRIED PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK THAN THOSE WHO ARE DIVORCED OR SINGLE RESEARCHERS PUT IT DOWN TO THE SUPPORT FROM A SPOUSE IN ASSISTING RECOVERY THE DAILY MAIL AND THE DAILY MIRROR COVER A SEPARATE STUDY FROM THE UNITED STATES WHICH FOUND THAT BEING MARRIED ALSO INCREASES YOUR CHANCES OF BEATING BLOOD CANCER BY TWENTY PER CENT OF THE STUDY'S AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT HAVING SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR CAN MAKE YOU MORE DETERMINED TO FIGHT THE DISEASE SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN
WHERE YOU LIVE AS WE KNOW HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON YOUR ATTITUDE TO THE DEBATE ABOUT WITH THAT WE SHOULD STAY IN OR QUICK THE EEL WHICH IS WHY THROUGHOUT THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THROUGHOUT THIS MORNING'S PROGRAMME AND DAY WE'VE BEEN TOURING THE COUNTRY TO GET A SENSE OF DIFFERENT VIEWS AROUND THE COUNTRY SUCH JOINS IT'S THIS MORNING FROM HULL MORNING
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING NICK YES I'M IN HULL AT THE DEEP THERE MAKE THE BIG ATTRACTION WHICH IS ONE OF HULL'S MAJOR DRAWERS NOW WE'RE LOOKING OUT ON TO THE GIANT HUMBER ESTUARY A REMINDER THAT FOR CENTURIES THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PORT LOOKING TOWARDS NORTHERN EUROPE TRADING WITH NORTHERN EUROPE OF COURSE IN MORE RECENT YEARS THE CITY HAS BEEN IN DECLINE IT'S OFTEN DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE MOST STRUGGLING CITIES IN ENGLAND
GIVE ME ONE SECOND IT'S OFTEN DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE MOST STRUGGLING CITIES IN ENGLAND RECENTLY THINGS HAVE BEEN LOOKING UP AS SIEMENS WHO ARE GOOD TALKING TO YOU LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IS MAKING A MAJOR INVESTMENT HERE AND ALSO NEXT YEAR HOLE IS GOING TO BE THE CITY OF CULTURE I BOTH HAVE THINGS COULD BE BOTH OF THESE THINGS COULD BE AFFECTED BY A LEAVE VOTES WHY ARE PEOPLE IN THE CITY CHOOSING TO GO I'M JOINED BY TWO BUSINESSMEN OWNERS OF MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES
CHERRY BURTON AND ANGUS WEST BURTON IF I CAN ASK YOU FIRST OF ALL WHY WOULD YOU SUPPORT THEY LEAVE WHY ARE YOU CAMPAIGNING FOR IT MORNING
THE REASON WHY I THINK THIS REFERENDUM COULDN'T HAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME BECAUSE I THINK THE E.U. IS GOING TO EXPLORED EH I THINK GREECE WILL DO FAULT THIS MONTH THE FOLLOWING MONTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN SPAIN
FRANCE PORTUGAL ITALY IS GOING UP ALL THE TIME SO I DON'T THINK YOU COULD COME UP BETTER TIME AS I SAY AND I THINK
YOU GOOD MONTHS IN BRUSSELS HAS GROWN TOO BIG FOR THEIR OWN GOOD IF IT WAS A BUSINESS UP FOR SALE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD BUY IT
TOUCH IT WITH A BARGE PAUL BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A SHOCK ISN'T THERE WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOCK FOR YOUR BUSINESS IS SHOCK FOR LOCAL JOBS HERE IN HULL ABSOLUTELY YES THE RIGOUR NOT ABSOLUTELY YES THE IS GOING TO BE A SHOCK BUT WE CANNOT DETERMINE WHAT THAT'S
OH LONG THAT'S GOING TO BE IS IT GOING TO BE SHORT TERM LONG TERM BUT IN THE LONG TERM I THINK IT WILL BE GREAT FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN
LOCAL BUSINESSMAN BEEN DOING IT FOR FORTY YEARS WE HAVE BEEN TRADING OUTSIDE THE WATCH YEARS WITH COMPANIES LIKE JAPAN
SOUTHERN KOREA TAIWAN AND THESE EMERGING COUNTRIES ARE THE FUTURE FOR THE U.K. THEY'LL FORGET THE U.K. IS THE FIFTH BIGGEST COUNTRY ECONOMIC
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD SO NO ONE'S GOING TO SAY NO WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRADE WITH YOU THAT IS
PURE OR SCARE MONGERING ANGUS WEST YOU EMPLOY PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE HERE IN THE CITY THE CITY COULD BE ON THE TURN THINGS ARE LOOKING BETTER WHY WOULD YOU VOTE
I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT HOLDS ON THE TURN AS WE LOOK ACROSS THE HUMBER ESTUARY WANT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU NOTICE IS THERE'S NOWHERE FISHING TRAWLERS WHICH OF COURSE IS A DIRECT RESULT OF
MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH HOLES ALWAYS BEEN A VERY INNOVATIVE AND ENTERPRISING CITY AND I'M AND I THINK THIS WHOLE E.U. DEBATE IS ABOUT INNOVATION ENTERPRISE AGAINST CORPORATE ISM AND BIG BUSINESS
I DON'T THINK HE WAS LEAVING THE E.U. IS GOING TO HAVE ANY EFFECT WHATSOEVER ON THE CITY OF CULTURE NEXT YEAR THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN COMING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IT'S DOWN TO THE AGAIN THE ENTERPRISE OF THIS CITY THAT HE HAS BEEN REWARDED WITH THAT TITLE AS FAR AS SEAMAN'S COMING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY VERY WELCOME
IT'S IT'S IT'S A NEW BUSINESS INTO THE CITY BUT SEAMAN'S IS GOING TO BE SELLING THE OTHER TOOK THE TOOK THE WIND TURBINES GLOBALLY I DON'T AND THAT'S GOING TO BE AFFECTED AT ALL BY THE E.U. I MEAN THE DEAL IS DONE AT THE INVESTMENT'S COMING IN SEAMAN'S HAVE HAD SOME WENT SORRY SOME WONDERFUL GRANTS TO COME TO HOLE AND THEY'VE MADE THAT DECISIONS ARE DOING THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THINGS AT ALL HELL IS ON THE UP DEFINITELY I MEAN THERE'S UNCERTAINTY
WHETHER WE STAY IN OR WHETHER WE GO OURS BOTH SIDES ARE HAVING TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION SIEMENS WHO SAID THAT FUTURE INVESTMENT WOULD BE JEOPARDISED WELL AS WELL AS WE KNOW A LOT OF BIG A LOT OF BIG BUSINESSES
IN THIS PARTICULAR CLUB WHICH IS SUPPORTING REMAINING IN THE E.U. WE IN THE SMALL OR MEDIUM SIZED ENTERPRISE SECTOR WHICH IS SIXTY PERCENT OF THE JOBS IN BRITAIN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THAT SECTOR
WHERE THE INNOVATION ENTERPRISE OF THE FUTURE IS GOING TO COME FROM WITH JOBS AND CREATING WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING GET ANGUS WESTERN JAYBIRD AND THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THANK YOU MORE FROM HELD BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK WHEN WE'LL BE HEARING FROM SIEMENS ON THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN OUR MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING M.P.S HAVE CALLED FOR PEOPLE TO BE GIVEN EXTRA TIME TO REGISTER TO VOTE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM AFTER UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND LED TO TECHNICAL PROBLEMS ON THE VOTER REGISTRATION WEBSITE BEFORE THE MIDNIGHT DEADLINE
THE APPEARANCE OF THE SPORTS DIRECT FOUNDER MIKE ASHLEY BEFORE M.P.S YESTERDAY GENERATED MANY HEADLINES AS HE ADMITTED WORKERS HAD BEEN PAID BELOW THE MINIMUM WAGE AS A RESULT OF PROLONGED SECURITY CHECKS MIKE ASHLEY SAID THE COMPANY HAD PROBABLY OUTGROWN HIS ABILITY TO MANAGE IT BUT HE WAS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT JO ANN A SHIN
THE SPORTS DIRECT BOSS MIKE ASHLEY HAD RESISTED THE COMMONS BUSINESS INNOVATION AND SKILLS COMMITTEE FOR MORE THAN FOUR MONTHS B.B.C. AND GUARDIAN REPORTS EXPOSED WORKING PRACTICES INCLUDING PAY BELOW THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE OF LENGTH THE UNPAID SEARCHES AT THE END OF SHIFTS HAVING FINALLY ARRIVED AT WESTMINSTER IT BRIEFLY LOOK LIKE MY ASHLEY WAS A MAN OF FEW WORDS THE COMMITTEE CHAIR IAN WRIGHT ASKED HIM ABOUT A REVIEW INTO WORKING PRACTICES AT THE SPORTS RETAILER WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE REVIEW
WORK IN PROGRESS WHEN WILL IT BE COMPLETED NEVER WELL THE SHORT ANSWER'S DIDN'T LAST LONG MIKE ASHLEY MADE IT CLEAR SPORTS DIRECT HAD MUSHROOMED IT'S LIKE HAVING GOING OUT ONE DAY YOU'VE GOT A TINY LITTLE INFLATABLE AND YOU'RE IN CONTROL AND THE MIX
WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND YOUR OWN OIL TANKER AND THAT WILL TAKE YOU YOU CAN'T BE ALL OVER THAT OIL TANKER AND IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WHAT OR MAP OIL TANKER BY THE WAY YOU'RE STILL RESPONSIBLE
AS A PILOT ULTIMATELY ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE FOR SPORTS THE RED I'M AWARE OF THAT BUT WHILE HE ACCEPTED ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY HE DIDN'T SEE HOW HE COULD BE AWARE OF ALL THAT WAS GOING ON AT THE COMPANY HE ACCEPTED THAT WHAT HE CALLED BOTTLE NECKS IN END OF SHIFT SECURITY SERVICES HAD MEANT PAY HAD FALLEN BELOW THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR THAT SPECIFIC BIT OF TIME
AND YOU'VE NO ADDRESS THAT I HOPE SO YEAH I CAN NEVER I'M NOT THERE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK BUT HE SAID CAPACITY HAD INCREASED TO THE POINT WHERE STAFF WILL BE ABLE TO WALK STRAIGHT THROUGH SECURITY
ONE OF THE PRACTICES THAT SPORTS DIRECT HIGHLIGHTED IN MEDIA REPORTS WAS THAT A FINDING SOMEONE FIFTEEN MINUTES' PAY IF THEY WERE A MINUTE LATE LIKE ASHLEY SAID HE HADN'T KNOWN ABOUT THAT AND DID NOT APPROVE IF ONE OF MY KIDS WENT TO WORK SOMEWHERE AND THEY WERE TWO MINUTES LIKE THEY'VE GOT FINED FIFTEEN MINUTES
I WOULD BE VERY IMPRESSED BY THAT I THINK THAT'S UNREASONABLE BUT THAT SAID HE SAID THERE WERE LIMITS I'M NOT FATHER CHRISTMAS I'M NOT SAYING THERE A HOLE I'M GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD WONDERFUL YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY AND GET A BALANCED VIEW
AND SAY THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD YOU TOLERATE THAT IS THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST IT BELIEVE IT ISN'T I TRAINED YOU
THE COMMITTEE HAD HEARD EVIDENCE FROM THE FEMALE STAFF MEMBER WHO HAD BEEN TOLD BY MORE THAN ONE MANAGER THAT IF SHE WANTED A CONTRACT SHE NEEDED TO DISCUSS IT OVER DINNER LABOUR'S PETER KYLE ASKED FOR MIKE ASHLEY'S REACTION DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THIS IS
IN YOUR BUSINESS THE BUSINESS YOU CREATED THE SHAPE IN YOUR IMAGE
THIS IS HAPPENING IN YOUR BUSINESS WHEN IT SHOULDN'T IF IT DOES IT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT
SHOULD NOT BE GOING ON I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN PLACE
TO STOP IT BUT AT LEAST I'M GOING TO TRY YOU HE WAS YOU SAID DON'T SAY THOSE THINGS TO ME HONESTLY
BUT HE RETURNED TO A FAMILIAR THEME HOW IN A COMPANY THE SIZE OF SPORTS DIRECT COULD HE BE EXPECTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON LABOUR'S PETER KYLE SUGGESTED IF THAT WASN'T POSSIBLE PERHAPS SOMEONE ELSE SHOULD DO THE JOB YOU'VE GONE FOR A DINGHY
TO AN OIL TANKER SHOULDN'T YOU GET SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'D SAIL AND DRIVE AN OIL TANKER POSSIBLY
POSSIBLY I CAN ACCEPT THAT THEIR CRITICISM OF SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SAID TO ME TODAY WOULD ACTUALLY LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT
AHEAD OF MISTER ASHLEY AND PEAS AT HER FROM THE UNITE UNION WHO STAFF HAD HAD LITTLE TIME FOR THE SUGGESTION BUT NO ONE KNEW ABOUT THE WORKING PRACTICES AND SPORTS DIRECT SHIREBROOK WAREHOUSE IN DERBYSHIRE THE MAJORITY OF STAFF ARE EMPLOYED BY AGENCIES THEY SAID AND THERE WAS WHAT UNITES REGIONAL OFFICER LUKE PRIMA ROLLER DESCRIBED AS A CULTURE OF FEAR IN THE WAREHOUSE WITH A SYSTEM OR SIX STRIKES AND YOU'RE OUT STRIKES CAN BE UP A TREE
AND THERE IS NO COME BACK THERE IS NO ARGUING ABOUT IT YOU CAN HAVE A STRIPED FOR SPENDING TOO LONG IN THE TOILET YOU CAN HAVE A STRIKE
EXCESSIVE CHATTED YOU CAN HAVE A STRIKE FOR TAKING A DAY OFF SICK OR HAVING TO STAY AT HOME
AS YOUR CHILDREN ARE SICK A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST SHOW DOZENS OF AMBULANCE CALL OUT INCLUDING ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH IN A TOILET LIKE ASHLEY WAS LATER ASKED IF HE WOULD MEET WITH UNITE HE SAID HE WOULD AT THE COMPANY'S A.G.M. IN SEPTEMBER BUT NOT BEFORE HE SAID HE BELIEVED HE COULD DO A BETTER JOB FOR EMPLOYEES THAN UNITE COULD
BEFORE LEAVING MIKE ASHLEY SAID M.P.S ON THE COMMITTEE WELCOME TO LOOK AROUND HIS WAREHOUSE AT ANY POINT
WHAT DO YOU LOOK INTO SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE WAS DOING THEIR JOB MY ASHLEY SAID AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW MIGHT BE BETTER BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE ROSE TINTED GLASSES
JO ANN A SHIN REPORTING THERE OF COURSE YOU CAN HEAR MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AT HALF ESTATE ON DIGITAL AND ON LONG WAVE IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN USING A HANDS FREE MOBILE PHONE WHILE DRIVING IS JUST AS DANGEROUS AS ONE THAT IS IN YOUR HAND THAT IS WHAT RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX FOUND AFTER CONDUCTING A STUDY THAT HAS JUST BEEN PUBLISHED DOCTOR GEMMA BREAKS IS A LECTURER IN PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIAL SCIENCE IS NOW BASED AT THE OPEN UNIVERSITY AND IS THE AUTHOR OF THE STUDY SHE JOINS US NOW GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW DID YOU ESTABLISH THIS
WELL THERE'S QUITE A LARGE BODY OF RESEARCH ALREADY EXISTING THAT SUGGESTS THAT IF YOU'RE TALKING ON A MOBILE PHONE HANDS FREE WHILST DRIVING YOU AROUND FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT
WHAT INTERESTED ME AND MY COLLEAGUES IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR FINDING WAS THAT THAT DISTRACTION AND THAT RISK OF ACCIDENT CONTINUES FOR AROUND FIVE MINUTES AFTER YOU'VE ENDED THAT PHONE CONVERSATION LIKE THAT BUT YOU ESTABLISHED THAT THIS FINDING BY COMPARING DIFFERENT GROUPS OF DRIVERS SOMEONE HAND THREE DEVICES SOME NOT
WE WE ASKED YES SOME PARTICIPANTS TO DRIVE WITHOUT ANY DISTRACTION AND SOME TO DRIVE WHILST HAVING A HANDS FREE CONVERSATION AND WE'VE VARIED THE TYPE OF CONVERSATION THAT WE ASKED THEM TO HAVE SO SOME OF OUR PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT SPARKED THEIR MENTOR IMAGINATION THEIR VISUAL IMAGINATION
RIGHT AND OTHERS WE'RE ASKED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WHICH DIDN'T MAKE THAT KIND OF DEMAND ON THEN THEY JUST NEEDED TO KIND OF RESPOND TO MORE KIND OF FACTUAL STATEMENTS BUT WERE BOTH THOSE SORTS OF OF CONVERSATIONS EQUALLY DISTRACTING IF YOU WERE ON A HANDS FREE DEVICE COMPARED TO IF YOU WEREN'T
THEY WEREN'T EQUALLY DISTRACTING NO AND THIS IS WHY WE WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN FOLLOWING THIS FINDING UP SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS CONVERSATIONS THAT REQUIRED SOMEONE TO CREATE MENTAL IMAGERY SO TO PICTURE WHERE THEIR CONVERSATION PARTNER IS OR WHAT THEY'RE DESCRIBING
WAS MORE DISTRACTING THEIR CONVERSATION THAT DIDN'T REQUIRE THAT LEVEL IT WAS MORE DEMANDING AND THEREFORE MORE DISTRACTING IT WAS YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO WE MEASURE DISTRACTION IN TERMS OF THE HAZARDS THAT THE DRIVERS DETECTED AND THEIR REACTION TIMES TO THEM BUT WE ALSO MEASURED THEIR EYE MOVEMENT SO WE COULD IDENTIFY THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT CERTAIN HAZARDS BUT NOT NECESSARILY REACTING TO WHAT IF YOU HAD THE SAME KIND OF CONVERSATION WITH A PASSENGER IN A CAR
YEAH IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION THIS THIS STUDY WAS AIMED INVESTIGATING THAT DIFFERENCE AND IT SEEMS THAT A CONVERSATION WITH A PASSENGER IS QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A SHARED ENVIRONMENT WITH YOU
SO THEY CAN SEE WHAT YOU CAN SEE AND ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT BE DISCUSSING SOMETHING THAT ISN'T RELATED AT ALL TO THAT SHARED ENVIRONMENT
THAT PASSENGER HAS THE CAPACITY AND THE ABILITY TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN SEE AND THEREFORE THEY CAN REGULATE THEIR CONVERSATION
DEPENDENT ON THE YOU'RE DRIVING DEMANDS THEY MIGHT EVEN HELP YOU IF IF SOMETHING PARTICULARLY DEMANDING HAPPENS SOMEONE ON THEIR MOBILE PHONE MAY NOT KNOW BUT YOU'RE DRIVING AND THEREFORE WILL CONSISTENTLY DEMAND YOUR ATTENTION
DOCTOR GEMMA BREAKS FROM THE OPEN UNIVERSITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN CHRIS FAWKES IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER THAT'S ON IT WE'RE LOOKING AT QUITE A CLOUDY START TO THE DAY SOME MIST AND MURK AROUND AS WELL BUT THINGS WILL TURN BRIGHTER WITH SOME WARM SPELLS OF SUNSHINE COMING THROUGH THERE'LL BE SOME HEAVY SHOWERS AROUND BUT NOT QUITE AS TORRENTIAL AS THOSE OF YESTERDAY THAT BROUGHT SOME FLOODING PROBLEMS PARTICULARLY AROUND THE LONDON AREA AND INTO OUR PARTS OF BRIGHTON AS WELL
THE START OF THE FORECAST ACROSS SOUTH WEST ENGLAND WHERE WE DID HAVE SOME LOW CLOUD AND SOME MIST THIS WILL TEND TO LIFT WITH SOME SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH AND IT SHOULD STAY DRY TEMPERATURES OF TWENTY THREE DEGREES IT'S ACROSS WALES NORTH WEST ENGLAND TO THE MIDLANDS AND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND AFTER A RATHER CLOUDY START WITH A FEW PATCHES OF MORNING RAIN AFFECTING SAY THE SOUTH MEDS THROUGH PARTS OF LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND THE RAIN WILL EASE OFF SHORE BUT THERE WILL BE SOME BRIGHTENING OF THE SKIES SOME SUNSHINE
AND THESE ERRORS WE PRONE SOME FAIRLY HEAVY SHOWERS LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON THERE WILL BE SLOW MOVING AS WELL SO STILL BRINGING SOME HEFTY DOWNPOURS BUT THE SHOWERS NOT QUITE AS TORRENTIAL AS THOSE OF YESTERDAY THEY WERE QUITE HUMID THOUGH TEMPERATURES BETWEEN TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY FIVE DEGREES FOR NORTH EAST ENGLAND AND EASTERN ENGLAND THE LARGELY DRY MORNING ALTHOUGH WE DO HAVE A SHOWER HIM WEST YORKSHIRE
SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH TEMPERATURES INTO THE LOW TWENTIES TODAY BUT A LITTLE CALL AROUND SOME OF THE NORTH SEA COAST WHERE TEMPERATURES PROBABLY PET BACKED AROUND FIFTEEN DEGREES WITH CLOUDY SKIES FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND SMIRKY WEATHER TO START THE DAY BUT SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH MOST AREAS WILL STAY DRY BUT THERE WILL BE A FEW SHOWERS FOR WESTERN SCOTLAND LATER ON TOP TEMPERATURES AROUND TWENTY TWO DEGREES THE WEATHER THANKS CHRIS NEXT WEEK RADIO FOUR LOOKS AT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN AND HOW WE GO ABOUT IT
WATCH THE WORLD GO BY AND YOU CAN'T HELP NOTICING THAT BEHIND ALL THE FACTS AND OPINIONS ARGUMENTS OF THE WRIST THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF WHALE BEHAVIOUR
PEOPLE ARE AT IT ALL THE TIME NOT LEAST POLITICIANS THERE THEY GO AGAIN OVER EUROPE BEHAVE
ON THE HUMAN ZOO WE'RE LESS INTERESTED IN WHAT PEOPLE SAY THE FALLS AND AGAINST THAN THE BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE BEHIND IT WHAT GOES ON IN THERE
AND DOWNS THE HUMAN ZOO WITH ME MICHAEL BLAST AND MAKING SENSE OF THE EVENTS THROUGH THE LENS OF PSYCHOLOGY HERE ON B. B. C. RADIO FOUR NEXT TUESDAY AT HALF PAST THREE
LATER IN THIS PROGRAMME WHAT DID THE SUPER FANS MAKE AT THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE NEW HARRY POTTER PLAY YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE EIGHTH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THERE ARE CALLS TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE TO REGISTER TO VOTE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM AFTER THE WEBSITE WAS OVERWHELMED LAST NIGHT BY PEOPLE TRYING TO SIGN UP ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST WANTED PEOPLE SMUGGLERS BLAMED FOR THE DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS THE MEDITERRANEAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED WITH THE HELP OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE AND SUSSEX POLICE HAVE BEEN CRITICISED FOR USING LEG RESTRAINTS AND HANDCUFFS ON AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL WITH A SEVERE MENTAL DISORDER
THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CHARLES CARROLL THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN LEARNED OTHER SENIOR M. PEAS SAY VOTER REGISTRATION FOR THE E.U. REFERENDUM SHOULD BE EXTENDED AFTER THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE SUFFERED SERIOUS TECHNICAL PROBLEMS BEFORE LAST NIGHT'S DEADLINE THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION SAYS HALF A MILLION PEOPLE REGISTERED YESTERDAY AND BLAMED THE DIFFICULTIES ON UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND ALAN SODI REPORTS FROM WESTMINSTER
THIS IS A MAJOR EMBARRASSMENT FOR A GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT INVOLVED IN EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGED VOTERS TO GUESS ON THE ELECTORAL ROLL EVEN AS THE DEADLINE APPROACHED YESTERDAY DAVID CAMERON WAS URGING PEOPLE TO REGISTER BUT WHEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DID THE WEBSITE WAS UNABLE TO COPE
IN ONE FIVE MINUTE PERIOD ALONE THERE WERE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL ATTEMPTS TO CLICK ON THE REGISTRATION FORM THE CABINET OFFICE WHICH HOSTED THE WEBSITE SAID IT HAD ATTEMPTED TO FIX THE TECHNICAL ISSUES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT SOME USERS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS RIGHT UP UNTIL THE DEADLINE
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER TIM FARRON DESCRIBED IT AS A SHAMBLES JEREMY CORBIN WAS AMONG THOSE WHO CALLED FOR AN EXTENSION NEITHER GOVERNMENT NOR THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION HAS YET SAID WHETHER THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
DAVID CAMERON MEMBERS NIGEL FARRAJ WERE FORCED TO DEFEND SOME OF THEIR CORE POLICIES ON THE E. WHO WHEN THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO TOUGH QUESTIONING FROM A TELEVISION AUDIENCE LAST NIGHT A CONSERVATIVE VOTER ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER OF FAILING TO HONOUR HIS PROMISE TO CURB IMMIGRATION WILDER UKIP LEADER FACED ALLEGATIONS OF RACISM A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON WAS WATCHING
NIGEL FARRAJ AND DAVID CAMERON FACED A STUDIO AUDIENCE THAT OFTEN APPEARED HOSTILE THE PRIME MINISTER WAS CONFRONTED BY A QUESTIONER WHO TOLD HIM IMMIGRATION MEANT HE COULDN'T GET A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS AND SEEN HIS HOME TOWN BECOME A NO GO ZONE
DAVID CAMERON ADMITTED I HAVEN'T MADE A FORECAST WHEN PUSHED TO PREDICTS THE LEVEL OF IMMIGRATION TO THE U.K. IF THE COUNTRY VOTED TO STAY IN THE E.U. BUT HE ADDED THAT SPENDING MORE ON THE HEALTH SERVICE REQUIRED A STRONG ECONOMY AND STAYING IN THE YEAR YOU WOULD SECURE THAT MY CAMERON SAID HE WOULD FIGHT FOR WHAT HE CALLED A GREAT BRITAIN AND NOT A LITTLE ENGLAND
NIGEL FARRAJ FACED A VOLLEY OF SCEPTICISM FROM THE AUDIENCE AND WAS ACCUSED OF ENCOURAGING RACISM HE INSISTED IT WAS ABOUT TIME THOSE HE CALLED ORDINARY DECENT BRITONS WERE PRIORITISED ADDING THE E.U. IMMIGRATION OR DAMAGED ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES
THERE WAS STRONG SUPPORT FOR HIS STANCE AMONG ETHNIC MINORITY VOTERS IT WAS AN HOUR OF PASSION ANGER AND IRRITATION FROM THOSE PUTTING THE QUESTIONS NEITHER MAN OFFERING ANSWERS DELIVERED A KNOCKOUT BLOW
A SURVEY SUGGESTS PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE Y. YOU WHO HAS FALLEN SHARPLY IN THE TEN LARGEST MEMBER STATES INCLUDING THE U.K. THE PEW RESEARCH CENTRE BASED IN WASHINGTON FOUND THAT ONLY THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF PEOPLE QUESTIONED IN FRANCE HAD A FAVOURABLE VIEW OF THE E.U.

THE POLICE WATCHDOG HAS CRITICISED OFFICERS IN SUSSEX FOR USING HANDCUFFS LEG RESTRAINTS AND A SPIT HOOD ON AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD CHILD WITH A SEVERE NEUROLOGICAL DISABILITY THE GIRL WAS ARRESTED SEVERAL TIMES DURING TWENTY TWELVE HAND HELD IN CUSTODY FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY HOURS THE I.P.C.C. SAID ELEVEN OFFICERS HAD A CASE TO ANSWER FOR MY CONDUCT OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE REPORTS
THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION EXAMINED THE WAY SUSSEX POLICE ARE DEALT WITH THE ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL AFTER SHE WAS ARRESTED THREE TIMES AND DETAINED ONCE UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT THE GIRL WHO HAS A SEVERE MENTAL DISORDER WHICH CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS WAS HELD IN HANDCUFFS AND LEG RESTRAINTS ARE SPIT GUARD OR SPIT HOOD A BAG WITH A MESH WAS PLACED OVER HER HEAD
THE I.P.C.C. SAID ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS POLICE DID NOT RECORD REASONS FOR THE USE OF FORCE OFFICERS WERE ALSO CRITICISED FOR FAILING TO ENSURE THE GIRL HAD ADULT SUPPORT WHILE IN CUSTODY HER MOTHER SAID SHE WAS DISGUSTED AT THE WAY HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN TREATED TO SEE YOUR OWN CHILD SHACKLED UP WITH LEG RESTRAINTS AT HANKOW BEHIND HER BACK WITH A SPIT HOOD OVER HER HEAD WAS THEIR WORST NIGHTMARE
IT WAS HORRIFIC IT WAS DEGRADING AND I WOULD NEVER GET THE IMAGE OUT OF MY MIND NINE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS INVOLVED HAVE SINCE RECEIVED MANAGEMENT ADVICE TO OTHERS HAVE RETIRED SUSSEX POLICE SAID ALL OF ITS OFFICERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEW TRAINING TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND REMINDED ABOUT THE WAY SPITZ HOODS SHOULD BE USED
HILLARY CLINTON HAS CLAIMED VICTORY IN THE RACE TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AFTER WINNING PRIMARY ELECTIONS IN MORE STATES HER RIVAL BERNIE SANDERS HE'S STILL REFUSING TO ADMIT DEFEAT MISSUS CLINTON TOLD SUPPORTERS THAT BEING THE FIRST WOMAN NOMINATED BY A MAJOR PARTY WAS AN HISTORIC MOMENT

AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE SAY THEY HOPE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN D.N.A. PROFILING COULD HELP TO CATCH THE KILLER OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DISAPPEARED IN BATH TWENTY YEARS AGO MELANIE HALL WHO WAS TWENTY FIVE WAS LAST SEEN IN A CITY NIGHTCLUB IN JUNE NINETEEN NINETY SIX HER BODY WAS FOUND THIRTEEN YEARS LATER IN WOODLAND NEAR THE M. FIVE MOTORWAY THE POLICE HAVE CONFIRMED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT D.N.A. EVIDENCE WAS FOUND NEAR MELANIE'S BODY HER PARENTS PAT AND STEVE HALL HOPE THEY'LL FIND ME NOW GET ANSWERS
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO IT WAS AND WHY I MIGHT LEAVE HER IN SUCH A
I DON'T KNOW A RIDICULOUS PLACE BY THE SIDE OF A MOTORWAY IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO ME BUT WE DO FEEL WE WANT SOMEONE FIND AND SOMEONE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE A MAN ON HIS BEHALF
IT WON'T TAKE THE HORAN HEARTACHE AWAY FROM US YOU KNOW THAT AS WITH US TIE DYING DAY THE HEAD OF THE INVESTMENT CONSORTIUM THAT BOUGHT B.H.S. FOR A POUND WILL APPEAR BEFORE M. PEAS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RETAILERS COLLAPSE DOMINIC'S REPEL A FORMER RACING DRIVER AND FORMER BANKRUPT WITH NO RETAIL EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN BLAMED BY MANAGERS AT B.H.S. FOR THE FAILURE OF THE FIRM
AND DRIVERS ARE BEING WARNED THAT TALKING ON A HANDS FREE DEVICE CAN BE JUST AS DISTRACTING AS USING A MOBILE PHONE AT THE WHEEL RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT DRIVER'S HOLDING PHONE CONVERSATIONS OFTEN FAILED TO SPOT HAZARDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM
THANK YOU CHARLES IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN LOCKED UP FOR SIXTY HOURS RESTRAINED WITH HANDCUFFS LEG STRAPS AND A BAG WORN OVER HER HEAD UNABLE TO SEE HER OWN MOTHER THERE WAS HELP POLICE TREATED AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL NOT ANY ELEVEN YEAR OLD OF COURSE SHE HAS A SERIOUS MENTAL DISORDER AND WHAT ARE DESCRIBED AS SERIOUS BEHAVIOURAL ISSUES BUT ELEVEN POLICE OFFICERS IN SUSSEX AND NOW BEING INVESTIGATED FOR MISCONDUCT IN THIS CASE
GUS SILVERMAN IS THE LAWYER FOR THE CHILD IS NOT BEING PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED IS THEREFORE REFERRED TO AS CHILD H. HE'S FROM THE LAW FIRM IRWIN MITCHELL
THIS IS A CASE CONCERNING THE USE OF HANDCUFFS SPIT HOODS AND LEG RESTRAINTS ON AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD CHILD WITH A NEUROLOGICAL DISABILITY AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME REAL QUESTIONS FOR SUSSEX POLICE TO ANSWER ABOUT WHY THEY CONSIDER IT IS APPROPRIATE TO USE THIS LEVEL OF RESTRAINTS IN PARTICULAR USING SPIT HOODS
WHICH I SUSPECT IT'S A A A FABRIC BAG THAT GOES OVER A PERSON'S HEAD
THERE IS A DRAWSTRING TO TIGHTEN THE BAG AND THE IDEA IS THAT OFFICERS USE A SPLIT WHOSE HONOURS DETAINEE HAS SPAT AT SOMEONE ELSE
WELL THE ANSWER I GUESS AS TO WHY THE OFFICERS IN THIS CASE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE WAS BECAUSE SHE DID HAVE A THINK WHAT ARE DESCRIBED AS VERY SERIOUS BEHAVIOURAL ISSUES DINGY AND WE KNOW THAT SHE WAS CLEARLY NOT ONLY SPITTING BUT PRESUMABLY IF SHE WAS HANDCUFFED WAS VIOLENT AS WELL IS THAT FAIR
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT HERD NEUROLOGICAL DISABILITY MEANT THAT SHE BEHAVED IN IN CHALLENGING WAYS HOWEVER
SPECIAL SCHOOLS HEALTH UNITS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY ARE CARING FOR PEOPLE WITH THESE CONDITIONS DAY IN DAY OUT I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF USING HOODS OF COURSE KNOWN WOULD SUGGEST THAT BEING SPAT AT HE'S A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE CLEARLY IT'S NOT BUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT HERE IS THE VERY
SIGNIFICANT RISK OF SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA TO HER CHILD WHEN THEY ARE HOODED AND ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MESSAGE THAT WAS BEING SENT TO POLICE OFFICERS WHEN THEY ARE TOLD IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO HAD A CHILD DOES IT CONCERN ME THAT IN THIS CASE THAT ALTHOUGH YES THERE IS A RECOMMENDATION THAT ELEVEN OFFICERS ARE INVESTIGATED TWO HAVE ALREADY RETIRED
AND TO HAVE RECEIVED IN A QUOTE MANAGEMENT ADVICE ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE A CASE HERE WHERE MY CLIENT WAS DETAINED IN POLICE STATIONS FOR KEEMA TIVE TITLE OF OVER SIXTY HOURS AND FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT TIME HAD NO APPROPRIATE ADULT NOW AN APPROPRIATE ADULT WOULD ALMOST ALWAYS BE THE CHILD'S
PARENT AND IN THIS CASE MY CHILD MOTHER WAS CONSTANTLY CONTACTING THE POLICE WAS CALLING WAS GOING DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION WAS ASKING HIM BEGGING TO BE ALLOWED TO SEE HER DAUGHTER IN DETENTION AND THERE WAS A CONSISTENT FAILURE BY CUSTODY SERGEANTS TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AND IS INCOMPLETE BREACH OF THE STATUARY CODE OF PRACTICE GOVERNING THE WAY TO TAKING SHOULD BE TREATED
SO WHAT HAVE SUSSEX POLICE LEARNT ABOUT HOW THEY DEALT WITH THIS CASE WERE JOINED BY THE DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE ACTING DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE ROBIN SMITH GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING NECK WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT WHAT DO YOU THINK WENT WRONG
FIRST OF ALL I GENUINELY DO WELCOME THE I.P.C.C. INVESTIGATION GIVEN IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO SUSSEX POLICE AND INDEED I THINK THE POLICE SERVICE HAVE LEARNT SO MUCH MORE ABOUT NOT ONLY HOW WE DEAL WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WITH WITH MENTAL ILL HEALTH BUT ALSO MENTAL HEALTH IN GENERAL YOU ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT A SUSSEX POLICE LEARNED
AS A RESULT OF THIS AND BEFORE THE REPORT CAME WAS PUBLISHED BY THE I.P.C.C. WE CONDUCTED A VERY THOROUGH TRAINING REVIEW THAT'S LOOKING AT PERSONAL SAFETY TRAINING FIRST PAY TRAINING OR MORE SPECIFICALLY COMMUNICATION SKILLS LINKED WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILL HEALTH SECONDLY WE'VE LOOKED AND REFRESHED AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SPIT GUARDS
ARE YOU GOING TO STOP USING THEM I MEAN WE HEARD THERE FROM THE LAWYER THAT SEVERAL FORCES AROUND THE COUNTRY DON'T EVEN USE THEM ON ADULTS LET ALONE AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL AND OF COURSE A NUMBER OF FORCES DO THEN CAUSE A NUMBER OF FORCES NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY DO BUT I'VE GOT AIRING ON WELL I DO THINK IT'S IT'S PART OF THE LEARNING PROCESS AND MAYBE WITH THE COLLEGE POLICING WE START TO REVIEW THE USE OF SPIT GUARDS
BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR JUST CLARIFY THOSE SUSSEX POLICE STILL THINK YOU SHOULD USE THE SUSSEX POLICE STILL USE SPIT GARMENTS AND WE'LL CARRY ON BUT I THINK IT'S I THINK WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SHOWS THAT WE WILL LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCES AND WITH THE HELP OF THE COLLEGE POLICING AND OTHERS LET'S REVIEW LET'S DISCUSS IT BECAUSE YOU SUSPECT GUARDS YOU KNOW NOT SO FAR AWAY FROM THE STUDIO I'M IN NOW YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO OR SO I REMEMBER ARRESTING SOMEONE HE WAS SPITTING SPITTING TALK SPITTING OFFICERS ADMITTEDLY NOT A CHILD
THE SPITTING AT OFFICES IN A POLICE CAR AND MYSELF IN THOSE DAYS WE WOULD SEEK TO TRY AND STOP THAT BY PUTTING SOMETHING OVER THEIR MOUTHS WELL OF COURSE THAT HAS INHERENT DANGERS YEP SO SINCE THEN WE HAVE
WE GIVE WARNINGS WE GIVE REASSURANCE WHICH SAY STOP WE ASKED TO DESI'S THAT FOR IT TO STOP AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BRIEF LAST ONE IF WE COULD WHICH IS THIS WHY DO YOU LET OFFICERS RETIRE WHEN THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG BEEN FOUND TO DO SOMETHING WRONG IT JUST INFURIATES THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THEIR BILLS DOESN'T IT WELL OF COURSE ARE LAURA'S CHANGED REGULATIONS CHANGED WITH REGARDS TO THAT
BUT OF COURSE YOU WILL ACCEPT THAT THIS HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO AND THROUGHOUT THAT TIME WE'VE DONE THE IMP P.C.T. HAVE DONE THEIR INVESTIGATION IS PROBABLY IMPORTANT ALSO RECOGNISE NICK THAT THE I.P.C.C. DID UPHOLD THE USE OF THE SPIT GUARDS IN THESE VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THIS REALLY
DIFFICULT CHILD WHO HAD REAL BEHAVIOUR PROBLEMS AS YOU DESCRIBED VERY SERIOUS BEHAVIOURAL ISSUES AND THERE'S BEEN NO REPEAT OF IT SEEMS WHICH I'M DELIGHTED HE'S O.K. CLEAR DISTRESS CALLED TO THE CHILD TO THE MOTHER TO TERRIBLE DISTRESS TO SEE A CHILD IN THAT SITUATION IS IT WHAT TIME OR HAVE YOU ISSUED ONE ALREADY FOR AN APOLOGY I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THAT AND I THINK NOBODY NOBODY IN SUSSEX POLICE NOBODY IN THE POLICE SERVICE WANTED A COMMUNITY OF SUSSEX
ONCE YOUNG PEOPLE INDEED AS A RESULT OF THAT LAST YEAR NO YOUNG PEOPLE COME INTO SUSSEX POLICE CUSS DISSENTERS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILL HEALTH
ROBIN SMITH THANK YOU THE TIME IS QUARTER PAST SEVEN THE BOSS OF THE ADVERTISING JOINED W. P. P. WILL DEFEND HIS PAY AT THE COMPANY'S A.G.M. TODAY ROB YEUNG HAS MORE ON THAT FIRST DROP YES A YEAR AGO SOME SHAREHOLDER GROUPS WERE OUTRAGED AT SOME ART AND SORREL WAS BEING PAID FORTY THREE MILLION POUNDS WILL TODAY THEY'RE BEING ASKED FOR THEIR VIEWS ON HIS LATEST PAY PACKET OF
SEVENTY MILLION THAT MAKES THE FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST AD AGENCY W. PEE PEE THE HIGHEST PAID BOSSED BY QUITE A MARGIN OF HER FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED BUSINESS W. P. P. SAYS THAT SIR MARTIN HAS OVERSEEN AND OUTSTANDING SET OF RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS WILL WITH US HAS CLIFF WAIT A DIRECTOR OF CHEFS OXY U.K. INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER SOCIETY MORNING GOOD MORNING THERE'D BE W. P. P. IS RIGHT ISN'T IT THE COMPANY IS DOING VERY WELL IT HAS DONE WELL YES
AND THEREFORE DOES NOT DESERVE A VERY GOOD BONUS THAT REWARDS HIM FOR ALL OF HIS EFFORTS HE DESERVES TO BE REWARDED YES BUT NOT AT THESE LEVELS SEVENTY MILLION IS FOURTEEN TIMES THE AVERAGE OF THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED CHIEF EXECUTIVES WERE SAFE
IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THE OTHER HIGHEST PEOPLE WITH SEE RECKITT HAD TWENTY THREE MILLION SKY SEVENTEEN MILLION FIFTEEN MILLION AND B. P. THIRTY MAIN SEVENTY MILLION IS JUST FAR TOO HIGH SIR MARTIN HAS DEFENDED HIS PAY SAYING THAT HE'S NOT ASHAMED OR EMBARRASSED BY IT HE SAYS HE'S PROUD OF WHAT HIS COMPANY HAS ACHIEVED AND OF COURSE HE SHOULD BE PROUD BECAUSE HE BUILT THIS COMPANY FROM SCRATCH
HE DID AND HE NOW OWNS SHARES WORTH SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IN THE COMPANY
WHICH IS A TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT ON HIS BEHALF WHAT I'M SAYING THOUGH IF SHE DOES NOT NEED ANY MORE INCENTIVES AT THIS THESE LEVELS ARE FAR TOO HIGH SO SEVENTY MILLION POUNDS IS TOO MUCH IN YOUR VIEW THEN WHAT IS THE RIGHT FIGURE HOW MUCH SHOULD HE BE PAID
CERTAINLY AT LEAST HALF OF THAT POSSIBLY SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY A LOT LESS THAN THAT AS WELL
THIS YEAR'S PAY VOTERS NOT BINDING ON THE COMPANY BUT SHAREHOLDERS DID APPROVE THE COMPANIES PAY POLICY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND SO ISN'T THE COMPANY ESSENTIALLY JUST IMPLEMENTING WI THE WISHES OF THE SHAREHOLDERS AS EXPRESSED BY A VOTE AT A PREVIOUS A.G.M. I THINK THAT'S TOO EASY AN ANSWER WITH THIS PLAN WAS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BY SHAREHOLDERS AND
THE SHAREHOLDERS REALLY SHOULD'VE WORKED RATHER HARDER WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING AT THIS THE FUND MANAGERS SHOULD HAVE MODELLED THE OUTCOME SO SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT THIS WAS POTENTIALLY GOING TO HAPPEN AND THE PLAN IS TOO GENEROUS IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE MANIFEST ANOTHER PEOPLE RECOMMENDED IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE A MOST B.P. SHAREHOLDERS RECENTLY REJECTED THE PAY OF THEIR BOSS BOB DUDLEY FORTY MILLION POUNDS A SHAREHOLDERS FLEXING THEIR MUSCLES MORE THIS YEAR OVER PAY THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS THE AVERAGE VOTE IN FAVOUR OF THE NEW NARRATION STILL A NINETY TWO PERCENT LEVEL THAT SO THEY'RE NOT IX EXERCISING ENOUGH ENOUGH OF THEIR POWER WHICH THEY UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE WE NEED MORE THE AND FUND MANAGERS TO ACT WILL STRONGLY OH KAY THANK YOU CLIFF WAIT THAT THE DIRECTOR OF CHESS OXY U.K. INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER SOCIETY

DO YOU AGREE WITH WHAT NIGEL FARAGE SAID LAST NIGHT ABOUT TRADE THAT IF THEY PUT TARIFFS ON OUR STAY BEING THE E.U. THOSE TARIFFS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN A NET FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION SO NO TRADE DEAL IS BETTER THAN THE ROTTEN DEAL WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT I
WE COULD VERY EASILY GET A BETTER TRADE DEAL THAN THE ONE WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE E.U. HE WOULD START FROM THE POSITION OF TOWER FREE UNRESTRICTED TRADE WE COULD CERTAINLY BUILD ON THAT AND IMPROVE THAT NOT LEAST BY HAVING FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED YOU ASKED YOU WHETHER YOU AGREED WITH WHAT HE SAID ABOUT NO TRADE DEAL THAT IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT WE DIDN'T MANAGE TO RE NEGOTIATE A TRAY DO WITH YOU IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT DEAL AND WE END UP WITH TARIFFS
THAT IS BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WE WOULD END UP WITH TARRA FREE UNRESTRICTED TRAIT EVERY COUNTRY IN EUROPE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BILL OR FROM NON E.U. ICELAND TO NON E.U. TURKEY HAS TARRA FREE TRADE AND IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WE COULD ENJOY CAREFREE UNRESTRICTED TRADE AS THEY START AGAIN YOU'RE NOT ADDRESSING WHAT I ASKED WHICH IS WHETHER YOU AGREED WITH WHAT MY SAID THAT IF THEY PUT TARIFFS ON US OF THE E.U. PUT TARIFFS ON US THAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW
I DON'T ACCEPT THE PREMISE THAT THEY WOULD PUT THEN HE SAID I'M NOT PUTTING THE PREMISE I'M ASKING IF YOU AGREE WHAT WHAT HE SAID AND YOU'RE FIGHTING ME TO CONTRADICT HIM AND TALK I'M NOT SO DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM OR NOT I BELIEVE THAT IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THERE IS NO QUESTION WHATSOEVER OF US FACING TARIFFS THERE IS A SIXTY BILLION POUND TRADE SURPLUS FROM THE E. USE POINT OF VIEW IN TRAINING WITH US THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RESTRICT CROSS CHANNEL TRADE FROM WHICH THEY ARE THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARIES
RIGHT SO YOU'RE DEEP I MEAN IT SOUNDS AS IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE HE ACCEPTED THAT THAT WAS A SCENARIO THAT I DON'T ACCEPT IT BUT IF WE LEAVE WE WOULD FACE TOWER SAW RESTRAINT CLEARLY WE WOULDN'T IF YOU LOOK TODAY EVERY E. EVERY EUROPEAN COUNTRY WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION OF BEAN A RUSS HAS TO HAVE FREE TRADE WE COULD ENJOY THAT ONCE WE VOTED AND IF YOU ARE WRONG AND WE END UP IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT MISTER FARAGE WAS TALKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT THOSE TARIFFS
THE BURDEN ON WHOM THEY FALL IT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE E.U. BUDGET IS PAID FOR OUT OF GENERAL TAXATION COST OF TARIFFS IS BORNE BY I'M SORRY I'M GOING TO SEND THE PLANETS WOULD NOT IT STAYS GOING TO IT'S WHAT I WOULD NOT THE BURDEN OF THAT WOULD FALL UPON THE CONSUMERS WHO BUY GOODS FROM THE E. UINE WOULD FIND THE MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE EXPORTERS WHO FIND
THEIR EXPORTS TO THE E.U. BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE TO CONSUMERS TURTLE IN ICELAND AREN'T IN THE E.U. THEY HAVE UNRESTRICTED TERRITORY TRADE DO YOU IMAGINE THAT AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WHO WOULD GET WORSE TRADE TERMS OUTSIDE THE EASE AND TURKEY DOES OF COURSE WHO WOULDN'T I SIMPLY DON'T ACCEPT THAT WE WOULD FACE RESTRAINT AND TARIFFS WE WOULDN'T O.K. NIGEL POWERS ARE CERTAINLY BUT PREPARED TO ACCEPT THAT'S AN HOUR AND TO COMMENT ON IT YOU WHAT YOU WANT WHICH IS WHICH IS FINE ALTHOUGH HE HE IS YOUR LEADER
LET ME ASK YOU WERE COMFORTABLE POSITION ON THIS IS VERY VERY CLEAR YES YOUR YOU DO NOT LILY'S LEADER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD FACE AS THEY LEAVE WE DO NOT BELIEVE WE WOULD FACE RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE GIVEN THAT WE ARE GERMANY'S SINGLE LARGEST EXPORT MARKET IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY THAT HE HAS LINKED A VOTE TO REMAIN WITH SEX ATTACKS ON WOMEN BY MIGRANT MEN THE AUDIENCE LAST NIGHT RAISED THE ISSUE OF
MIGRATION IMMIGRATION AGAIN AND AGAIN AND IT'S A MICROCOSM OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE CROSS COUNTRY WITH THE AUDIENCE ALSO REMIND US HOW TO TALK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF THE TONE THEY TALKED ABOUT THE PRESSURES ON MIGRATION IN TERMS OF THE N.H.S. AND PUBLIC SERVICES I FEEL QUITE STRONGLY THAT EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT IMMIGRATION NEEDS TO BEGIN BIKE KNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE HAVE PREPARED TO TRAVEL HALFWAY ACROSS THE CONTINENT OR HOP AROUND THE PLANET IN SEARCH FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AND ING SOMETHING ADMIRABLE
BUT WE NEED TO CONTROL IT THERE IS NO CONTROL OVER IT DAVID CAMERON HAS FAILED PRODUCER AS SHE WAS MERCILESS REALLY REMINDED LAST NIGHT THAT'S WHY THEY LEAVE SAYS THAT IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE WE WILL HAVE AN AUSTRALIAN POINTS BASED SYSTEM THAT WILL BE FAT
I WANT TO COME BACK TO WOMEN QUITE A BUT ON THAT POINT THAT YOU'VE MADE WOULD THAT POINTS BASED SYSTEM THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WOULD IT REDUCE THE IMMIGRATION NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT WERE NET MIGRATION IS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND I BELIEVE THAT A FUTURE PARLIAMENT WOULD FETCH TO HAVE LESS IMMIGRATION WHO HAVE LOWER IMMIGRATION BUT THE KEY IS THAT WE KNOW WHAT HE SHOWED IT
EVERY YEAR LIKE IN AUSTRALIA DEPENDING ON THE NEEDS THE ECONOMY WOULD WE WERE DETERMINED AND WE HAVE COMMON WE DETERMINED THAT IT SHOULD BE THREE HUNDRED BUT THE BEAUTY OF HAVING CONTROL IS THAT YOU GET TO DECIDE AT THE MOMENT NO ONE THAT WE LACKED IN ANY ELECTION CAN CREDIBLY CLAIM TO REDUCE IMMIGRATION DAVID CAMERON SAID HE WOULD REDUCE IT TO LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND I THINK IT'S RUNNING AT SOMETHING LIKE THREE HUNDRED YES
GETTING BACK CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION MEANS WE CAN ELECT A GOVERNMENT WHO CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER ON HER PROMISE TO REDUCE IMMIGRATION IF UNDER THE POINTS BASED SYSTEM YOU WANT WE ENDED UP WITH THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND AS WE HAVE NOW A BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ECONOMY DEMANDS AND YOU'D BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BECAUSE IT'S UNDER THE RIGHT SORT OF SWISS UNDER AUSTRALIA'S SYSTEM IN AUSTRALIA THEY HAVE THIS DEBATE AND MATE NO
MYSTIC ABOUT IT IT'S A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE IN AUSTRALIAN POLITICS BUT THERE'S A SATISFACTION IN AUSTRALIA THAT DEMOCRATICALLY THEY DECIDE ON THE LEVEL THAT WORKS FOR AUSTRALIA AND IT WORKS FOR AUSTRALIA THERE IN THEIR SIXTEENTH YEAR OF CONSECUTIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THERE'S A FEELING IN AUSTRALIA THAT AUSTRALIA GETS TO DEMOCRATICALLY DECIDE THE LEVEL OF MIGRATION WE NEED THAT TO GET GOING GOING BACK TO THE SEX ATTACKS ON ON WOMEN POINTER IN THE ORIGINAL COMMENTS OF MISTER FARAGE MADE HE TALKED ABOUT
THE NUCLEAR BOMB THIS TIME I'M BEING THE CHIP THIS TIME BEING THAT BECAUSE WE'RE VOTING IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM AND ABOUT WHETHER SEX ATTACKS LIKE THOSE IN COLOGNE COULD IT COULD OCCUR IN THE U.K. GIVEN THAT YOU'RE
WHAT DO YOU WANT IN TERMS OF THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION WAS THAT THE WRONG WAY TO TALK ABOUT IT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME TO TALK ABOUT
COLLECTING YOU'VE GOT NIGEL AND YOU AGREE WITH THE WAY WE DRESS HIM BARRAGE AT ALL GET THEM OUT YOU'VE GOT HIM ON IN THIS CHAIR IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR I THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT WE DON'T WE DON'T HELP IN HERE ACTUALLY I WAS YOU ARE THE ONLY M.P. FROM HIS PARTY I I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MIGRATION IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION YOU NEED TO
AS THE AUDIENCE REMINDED US LAST NIGHT YOU NEED TO USE THE RIGHT TONE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK TO TO RECOGNISE THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN THE AUDIENCE LAST NIGHT WHEN PRESSED ON THE ISSUE OF MIGRATION TALKED ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF PRESSURE ON PUBLIC SERVICES PRESSURE ON THE N.H.S. AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT YES WE WANT AN AUSTRALIAN TYPE SYSTEM SO WE CAN CONTROL OUR BORDERS BUT LET'S RECOGNISE THAT PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL HALFWAY ACROSS THE PLANET IN SEARCH FOR A BETTER LIFE OR DOING SOMETHING THAT IS EMINENTLY ADMIRABLE DOUGLAS CASTLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I KNOW IT'S TWENTY TO EIGHT WOULD YOU HAVE WILLIAM HAGUE ON THE PROGRAMME AFTER TEN PAST EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK NOW AT THE MORNING PAPERS THE SPORTS DIRECT BILLIONAIRE MIKE ASHLEY

THE F.T. REPORTS THAT MISTER ASHLEY'S COMMENTS TO M.P.S THAT HE'D INCREASE PAY AND MADE CHANGES TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS IN THE TIMES AS A COOL OF A CHILD CHIMNEY SWEEP SAYING COULD BE WORSE I COULD BE WORK IT SPORTS DIRECT THE DAILY MIRROR PETS NOEL EDMONDS ON ITS FRONT PAGE AFTER HE CAUSED TO TWITTER STORM WITH HIS COMMENTS ON CANCER THE PAPER REPORTS THAT THE T.V. PRESENTER TOLD HER STUNNED CANCER VICTIM HIS NEGATIVITY MAY HAVE CAUSED THE DISEASE THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE MAN HAD ACCUSED THE HOST OF DEAL OR NO DEAL OF QUACKERY FOR SUGGESTING
THAT AN ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE MACHINE TACKLES CANCER THE TIMES AND THE GUARDIAN BOTH COVER AND YOU MEASURE TO GIVE VICTIMS OF FORCED MARRIAGE IN ENGLAND AND WALES LIFELONG ANONYMITY YOU'LL MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO PUBLISH BROADCAST INFORMATION THAT COULD IDENTIFY THE VICTIM AND WILL ALSO INCLUDE SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER KAREN BRADLEY IS QUOTED IN BOTH PAPERS ARE SAYING THE MOVE WILL GIVE VICTIMS THE CONFIDENCE TO COME FORWARD AND SEEK JUSTICE FORCED MARRIAGE WAS MADE IN A FENCE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE CONVICTION
AND THE ABILITY OF FISH TO RECOGNISE HUMAN FACES ARE GETS COVERAGE AND SEVERAL OF THE PAPERS THERE'S SOME REPORTS THAT SCIENTIST TRAINED TO TROPICAL ARCHERFISH TO SPIT JETS OF WATER AT ONE OF TWO FACES BY REWARDING THEM WITH FOOD THEY WERE THEN SHOWN FORTY FOUR FACES THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY TEAM FOUND THAT THEY SPAT AT THE FAMILIAR FACE MORE THAN EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE TIME THE RESEARCHER INVOLVED KEEP NEWPORT TOLD THE TIME SHE THOUGHT THE FISH SPECIALS SPECIFICALLY RECOGNISED HER AS THE BRINGER OF FOOD SHE SAID THEY WOULD GET ANNOYED IF I DIDN'T FEED THEM FAST ENOUGH AND THEY SEEM TO SPIT AT MY FACE MORE THAN
ANYONE ELSE EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT A FULL APOLOGY PRAYS FOR HER PROFESSIONALISM BEST WISHES FOR A FUTURE CAREER AND OH YES JUST HELP A LITTLE BIT A CHECK FOR SEVERAL MILLION QUID THAT'S WHAT THE FORMER CHELSEA TEAM DOCTOR DOCTOR EVA CANARIAN SECURED YESTERDAY WHEN THE CLOS CLUB LOST ITS NERVE AT THE START OF WHAT LOOKS SET TO BE A RATHER PAINFUL INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNAL IT ALL BEGAN OF COURSE WITH WHAT CHELSEA'S FORMER MANAGER JOSE MARIE DID
OR DID NOT SAY WHEN SHE RAN ONTO THE PITCH DURING A MATCH SHE SAYS SHE HEARD HIM SAY AND FORGIVE ME FOR THIS A DEEPLY OFFENSIVE PORTUGUESE PHRASE MEANING DAUGHTER OF A WHORE HE INSISTED HE SAID SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR IN PORTUGUESE BUT WHICH MORE AN EXPRESSION OF EXASPERATION MEANING SON OF A BITCH JOIN HIM IN THE STUDIO TO DISCUSS THE LINGUISTIC PITFALLS JEAN MARC VOL WHO'S PROFESSOR IN APPLIED LINGUISTICS IN MULTI LINGUAL ISM AND YOU CAN INSTANTLY CORRECT THE PRONUNCIATION OF HIS NAME AND JAMIE FRAMPTON
HE'S AN EX REFEREE AND FORMER HEAD OF REFEREE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE F.A. MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING KIT GET IT RIGHT FOR ME WHICH IS JEAN MARC SUMMER DOVER MUCH WE'RE NOT IT'S NOT TOO BAD HOW
HOLMAN A PROBLEM IS IT IN ALL THE VERY MANY LANGUAGES I KNOW YOU SPEAK SIX IS IT IN TOTAL HOW COMMON A PROBLEM IS IT THAT PHRASES THAT ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR CAN BE MISUNDERSTOOD PARTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE TO LISTEN TO WHETHER THE FEMININE ALL THE MASCULINE IS USED WHICH WAS RELEVANT IN THIS CASE WAS
RIGHT BUT IN FACT I THINK THE FAMINE AND WAS DEFINITELY YOUTH YOU YOU HEAR AT A AT THE END SO IT'S NOT A MASCULINE AND YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE LISTENED BACK I LISTEN BACK AND THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT SO IT WAS CLEARLY ADDRESSED TO THE DOCTOR AND IT WAS A CLEAR STRONG
INSULT IN PORTUGUESE YEAH CLEARLY HE DENIES THAT AND SAID HE DIDN'T REALLY SAY THAT HE SAID SOMETHING MUCH MILDER NO A RATHER THAN O. O. K. BUT HOW KORMA AN ISSUE IS THIS IN IN IN IN THE VARIOUS LANGUAGES YOU STUDY
WELL THE THING IS THAT IT IS IT IT WAS A GOOD STRATEGIC CHOICE OF HIM IF HE HAD THAT TO MAKE THAT SPLIT SECOND DECISION BECAUSE HAD HE HE HE HE MAY HAVE CHOSEN A DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS NOT I THINK HE CHOSE PORTUGUESE WHICH
WHAT WAS THE SAFER OPTION BECAUSE WHATEVER HE SAID IN PORTUGUESE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS BAD AS THE EQUIVALENT EXPRESSION IN ENGLISH WHICH WOULD CAUSE AN UPROAR SO IT WAS IN FACT A CLEVER MOVE YET OFFERED OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE NOT CALCULATING THEIR FURIOUS AND THEREFORE THEY DO THEY USE THEIR MOTHER TONGUE AND WELL YES I KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT
CAMERAS ARE TRAINED ON NEW YOU DO WATCH OUT YOU DO SELL CENSURED JENNY FRAMPTON HAVE YOU BEEN SWORN AT IN A VARIETY OF LANGUAGES WHEN A REFEREE NO ABSOLUTELY I HAD A COMMENT MADE BY ONE OF RADIO STATIONS YESTERDAY ABOUT HOW DO I KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY IS SWEARING AT ME OR TO ME OR AROUND ME WHEN THEY'RE USING A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
AND THE ANSWER OH CLEAR ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IT'S ABOUT THE CONTEXT IT'S ABOUT THE BODY LANGUAGE THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THERE BUT THE USE OF THEIR VOICE THE VOLUME YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S INAPPROPRIATE SO WHEN YOU'RE THINKING WHETHER TO PULL OUT A YELLOW CARD AND READ IN THE MOST EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS IT IS THIS DIRECTED AT ME IS THIS IS AS IT WERE OFFENSIVE TO THE OFFICIAL ON THE PITCH RATHER THAN SOMEONE SAYING A VERSION OF DRAT IT WITH RATHER MORE COLOURFUL LIKE WE'VE ABSOLUTELY SO
SOMEONE HAS JUST MISSED AT THE GOAL BY A COUPLE OF INCHES AND THEY COME OUT WITH A FRUSTRATION WORD YOU WOULD VERY POLITELY SAY UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION KEEP YOUR LANGUAGE DOWN
BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THEN YOU HAVE EMPATHY BUT WHEN IT'S DIRECTED AT ME THE CONTEXT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT IF IT SO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF IT I MEAN YOU DON'T SPEAK SIX LANGUAGES LIKE I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING IT'S ABOUT WHEN THEY LOOK YOU IN THE EYES WHETHER THEY'RE POINTING AT YOU WHETHER IT'S AGGRESSIVE IN THAT AND THE LAW MAKES IT VERY CLEAR A FOAM STEPH INSULTING OR ABUSIVE LANGUAGE SO BY THAT IF I'M FINDING THAT OFFENSIVE OR ABUSIVE SOMETIMES YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE WORDS
IT'S ENOUGH IT'S ENOUGH AT SWEARIN LANGUAGE VERY FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IS CLEARLY OR ADVICE TO ONE SIDE AND J.D. FRONT AND JEAN MIGHT DEVELOP THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASURE THANK YOU THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN OXFORD STUDIO THIS MORNING IS CANON ANGELA TILL BE OF CHRISTCHURCH CATHEDRAL OXFORD GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING IN SPITE OF ALL THE DEBATE INCLUDING LAST NIGHT'S NONE OF US KNOW PRECISELY WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD THERE ARE MANY PREDICTIONS OF COURSE POINTING US TO LEAVE OR TO STAY
BUT FACTS FEEL LIKE THEY'RE IN SHORT SUPPLY MARTYN LEWIS THE GURU OF PERSONAL FINANCES SUGGESTED EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT THERE CAN'T BE ANY REAL FACTS BECAUSE A SITUATION WE FACE IS UNPRECEDENTED
WHAT WE ARE IN FOR HOWEVER WE VOTE IS RADICAL UNCERTAINTY
RADICAL UNCERTAINTY AS THE FATE OF HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN OUR WORLD BUT IN WAR AND CONFLICT THOSE FLEEING DISASTER THOSE WITH UNDIAGNOSED SYMPTOMS THOSE WHOSE FAMILIES ARE BREAKING APART
RADICAL UNCERTAINTY DOESN'T ALWAYS POINT TO TRAGEDY IT CAN BE JUST AS UNSETTLING TO BE ON THE BRINK OF GOOD NEWS PERHAPS A CHEQUE REALLY IS IN THE POST THIS TIME PERHAPS THE DRUG TRIAL WILL WORK PERHAPS THIS DAMAGE LOVE CAN BE HEALED IF IT TURNS OUT FOR THE GOOD WE WILL NEVER COMPLAIN AGAIN HAS IT
RADICAL UNCERTAINTY IS HORRIBLE HE PUTS US INTO A STATE OF ANXIETY READY FOR FIGHT OR FLIGHT AT SUCH TIMES WE CRAVE REASSURANCE ANYTHING WHICH CAN PUT SOLID GROUND BACK UNDER OUR FEET AND ENABLE US TO CALCULATE AND PLOUGH
BUT WE ALL KNOW REALLY YOU PUT RADICAL UNCERTAINTY IS PART OF LIFE THE UNFORESEEN STROKE OF GOOD LUCK THE UNEXPECTED CATASTROPHE BOTH COULD HIT US AT ANY TIME AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH A PLANNING OR A DESERVING
THERE'S A WHOLE GENRE OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE WHICH DEALS WITH RADICAL UNCERTAINTY IT'S CALLED APOCALYPTIC AND IT LOOKS LIKE A SET OF WEIRD PREDICTIONS OF WARS AND DISASTERS WITH HIDDEN DATES AND TIMES PROPER SCHISM SECRETS
BUT THE REVELATIONS ARE NOT FUTURE FACTS AND PEOPLE OFTEN THINK THEY ARE I'LL GET HUNG UP ON SAY COUNTING DOWN THE DAYS TO ARMAGEDDON THE POINT OF THESE REVELATIONS IS TO ASSURE THE FAITHFUL THAT ULTIMATELY THEY'RE SAFE
BEHIND THE DIM UNKNOWN STANDETH GOD WITHIN THE SHADOW KEEPING WATCH ABOVE HIS OWN AS A NINETEENTH CENTURY HYMN PUT IT
I READ AN ESSAY RECENTLY ABOUT THE BOOK OF JONAH THE HEBREW PROPHET WHO RAN AWAY FROM GOD AND ENDED UP BEING SWALLOWED AND THEN SHORTLY AFTERWARDS REGURGITATED BY A WHALE
AND IT WAS A QUOTE FROM THE SCOTTISH PHILOSOPHER JOHN MCMURRAY HE SAID THERE WERE TWO KINDS OF RELIGION ILLUSORY RELIGION AND REAL RELIGION ILLUSORY RELIGION SAYS FEAR NOT TRUST IN GOD AND HE WILL SEE THAT NONE OF THE THINGS YOU FEAR WILL HAPPEN TO YOU
RELIGION BY CONTRAST SAYS FEAR NOT THE THINGS YOU'RE AFRAID OF OR QUITE LIKELY TO HAPPEN BUT THEY'RE NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF
IN THE ABSENCE OF FAT WHICH WERE THROWN BACK ON OUR MOST BASIC BELIEFS AND INTUITIONS RADICAL UNCERTAINTY IS A TEST OF OUR RESILIENCE
PERHAPS WE ALL NEED TO SHAPE UP A BIT
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH KEN AND ANGELA TILBURY OF CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL OXFORD AT THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT HILLARY CLINTON HAS WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THE MOMENT THEY CAME LAST NIGHT BEING ABLE TO SAY THAT SHE WILL BE THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT THE FIRST TIME A WOMAN FROM HER PARTY ALL THE REPUBLICANS HAS ACHIEVED THAT
IT WAS A MILESTONE SHE HOPED TO REGION TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUT IT WAS BARACK OBAMA'S TIME AND HISTORY OF ANOTHER KIND WAS MADE LAST NIGHT AFTER WINNING NEW JERSEY ONE OF THE SIX PRIMARIES BEING CONTESTED SHE HAD THIS TO SAY
WE HAVE TO BE AS BIG AS THE VALUES THAT DEFINE A MIRROR
WE ARE WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN DEAD THIS IS ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE
WELL JIM NOTTIE IS WITH US NOW HE'S SPENT SO MUCH TIME ALREADY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS THIS PROCESS FROM THE TIME THIS PROCESS BEGAN JIM I MEAN TECHNICALLY BERNIE SAUNDERS IS STILL IN HER WAY BUT IT'S A MATTER OF TIME I SUPPOSE BEFORE HE HAS TO CONCEDE OH IT'S OVER TONIGHT'S MICHELLE WAS STILL COUNTING IN CALIFORNIA EIGHT HOURS BEHIND US OF COURSE BUT FORTY PLUS PER CENT OF THE VOTES COUNTED UNTIL HE CLINT'S AHEAD BY ABOUT SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PERCENT THAT MIGHT NARROW
BUT IN DELEGATE TERMS WITH THE SUPER DELEGATE UNTIL SHE'S WON IT THERE'S NO QUESTION AND EVERYTHING CHANGES IN A WAY YOU KNOW IT IT FEELS FAMILIAR WE'VE BEEN WATCHING HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP FOR ALL THESE MONTHS THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THEY FACE UP TO EACH OTHER DONALD TRUMP'S GOING TO TAKE ON THE CLINTONS DIRECTLY NEXT WEEK HE TELLS US IN A BIG SPEECH IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY ROUGH STUFF AND THEY BOTH HAVE BIG CHALLENGES I THINK ARE SUDDENLY PUT AT THE OTHER DAY HE NEEDS TO COOL DOWN AND SHE NEEDS TO WARM UP THEY BOTH HAVE PROBLEMS HE'S GOT TO
TONE DOWN SOME OF THE RHETORIC BECAUSE MANY REPUBLICANS THINK THAT WOULD LEAD TO A CATASTROPHIC DEFEAT SHE NEEDS TO SOMEHOW PERSUADE THOSE PEOPLE WHO'VE TAKEN AGAINST HER FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS BUT SHE IS AS WARM AS SHE SAYS HE HAS THAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR BOTH OF THEM BUT ANYONE WHO SAYS PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HE CAN'T WIN IS OF COURSE
QUITE WRONG AND WHEN YOU SAY SHE NEEDS TO TO WARM UP A GYM AND SHE HAS A PROBLEM WITH HER APPROVAL RATINGS WHY IS THAT SHE WAS A POPULAR SECRETARY OF STATE SHE WAS A POPULAR SECRETARY OF STATE WAS MANY PEOPLE BUT THAT IS THAT IS THAT CLINTON HISTORY WHICH FOR MANY PEOPLE HAS BECOME A KIND OF
OBJECT OF FASCINATION AND DON'T TRAMPLE GO FOR THAT SHE TURNED SOME PEOPLE OFF NOW IT HAS TO BE SAID THAT HE TURNED MORE PEOPLE OFF ACCORDING TO THE POLLS THEY BOTH HAVE HUGE PROBLEMS
THE QUESTION IS CAN HE DO THIS EXTRAORDINARY THING WHICH IS DONE THROUGH THE PRIMARIES AND MOBILISE ALL THE ANGER ALL THE FRUSTRATION A KIND OF NON IDEOLOGICAL SCREAM OF RAGE IF HE CAN HE WILL BE A VERY VERY FORMIDABLE OPPONENT FOR THIS
VERY CONVENTIONAL VERY PASSIONATE VERY CLEVER POLITICIAN IT'S GOING TO BE
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY RACE THE FIRST WOMAN CANDIDATE A MAN WHO'S GOT NO GOVERNMENTAL OR MILITARY EXPERIENCE IF YOU WERE ELECTED PRESIDENT HE WOULD BE THE ONLY PRESIDENT FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS IN THAT CATEGORY IT'S ALL NEW AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT MICHELLE IT IS ALL YET TO REALLY BEGIN JIM THANK YOU WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO TINA BROWN FORMER EDITOR OF VANITY FAIR AND THE NEW YORKER FOUNDER OF THE WOMEN IN THE WORLD ORGANISATION I ASKED HER ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS MOMENT
I THINK IT'S MASSIVE YOU KNOW ALL THE KIND OF BARNACLES THAT ARE STUCK TO HER OVER THE LAST YEAR IN A MOMENT OF TRIUMPH LIKE WE SAW LAST NIGHT DO YOU KNOW IT ALL WASHES AWAY IN A HUGE CELEBRATION BECAUSE SHE IS THE FIRST WOMAN TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE OR ANY BIGGER PARTY'S NOMINEE FOR PRESLEY THE STATES IT'S MASSIVE IN TERMS OF HISTORY
BUT YOU MUST BE STRUCK BY THE NUMBERS OF WOMEN PARTICULARLY YOUNGER WOMEN WHO DON'T SEEM TO FEEL THAT IT IS THAT SIGNIFICANT OR NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO WHOLEHEARTEDLY SAY I WILL VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON
SHE HAS ENORMOUS SUPPORT AMONG WOMEN LET'S FACE IT I MEAN SHE HAS LIKE A GIVES EIGHTY PER CENT OVERALL HOO HOO WHO OF DEMOCRATS WHO ARE WANTING HER TO BE THE PRESIDENT SO SHE DOES HAVE A LARGE SUPPORT SHE'S HAD A STRUGGLE WITH MILLENNIAL IT IS TRUE AND REALLY I THINK THAT'S MOSTLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT MY NEIL YOUNG WOMEN HAVEN'T YET EXPERIENCED WHAT
ANYONE A LITTLE OLDER HATS WHICH IS THE KNOCK BACKS THE SEXISM THE SENSE OF YOU KNOW HOW WOMEN HAVE TO WORK HARDER AND IT SEEMS VERY OFTEN TO TO GET THE GOALS THAT NATURALLY FALL TO MEN
AND YOU KNOW THEY DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S THE BIG PROBLEM THAT WOMEN HAVE OF HILARY'S GENERATION DID HOW WOULD YOU THEN ADVISE HER TO REACH OUT TO THE YOUNGER WOMEN WHO WERE JUST NOT CONVINCED BY WHAT SHE HAS TO OFFER AN WHO IN MANY CASES HAVE SUPPORTED THE SANDRA'S CAMPAIGN YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING I'D NOTICED TO MY CAUSE I HAVE A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHAT THE YOUNG WOMEN THE HILARY THAT THOSE YOUNG WOMEN LIKE THE HILARY THAT THEY LIKE
IS THE FIERCE FACED HILARY HE OF THE BLACK SHADES AND THE BLACKBERRY THAT YOU SAW ON THAT FAMOUS SHOT WHEN SHE WAS TRAVELLING A SECRETARY STATE THAT THEY FIND COOL WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE IS HILARY
THEY'RE THE OTHER SHE SHE HAS REALLY HAD WARDROBE ISSUES IS THE TRUTH AND IN THIS CAMPAIGN MEAN ON ON THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND SHE WAS WALKING HER WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS A SERGEANT PEPPER TROUSER SUIT AND YOU LOOK AT IT YOU'D JUST THINK THAT IT'S GOT TO BE THE DEFINITION AND UNCOOL SO SHE HAS THE KIND OF WHAT I CALLED THE COOL CHALLENGE WITH THE YOUNG WOMEN
AND IN MANY WAYS MY ADVICE TO HILARY WAS LOOK IN ON YOU IN A BITCH BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES THAT'S WHAT YOUNG WOMEN LIKE AND IF I THINK THAT YOU SAVE HER CLOTHES MATTER IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TO A YOUNG FEMINIST HER APPEARANCE THE ACTUAL CLOTHES SHE WEARS MATTERS THEY DO BECAUSE THEY CHANGE SO OFTEN YOU KNOW IN A FUNNY WAY I THINK HILARY WOULD OFTEN DO BETTER WITH A KIND OF A UNIFORM SO NOBODY'S THINKING ABOUT CLOTHES BUT THE OUTFITS CHANGE CONSTANTLY AND SO THERE'S A KIND OF A FOCUS ON THAT
VIC YOU KNOW SHE DOES BEST WHEN SHE'S HERSELF WHICH IS A FRANKLY A VERY SERIOUS POWERFUL UNCOMPROMISING UNSMILING SMILEY FACE KIND OF A WOMAN YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT YOU KNOW SHE'S SHE'S NOT THE KIND OF THE NATURAL POLE THAT A HUSBAND AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT IS SHE SAID SO HERSELF AND SHE SHOULD LEARN THAT YOU KNOW SHE SHOULD LIKEABILITY IS IN A SENSE AN UNCOOL THING TO WANT TO HAVE
I THINK THE MORE SHE CAN DISOWN THAT THE BETTER I MEAN IN A HIT MISSUS THATCHER HAD NO LIKEABILITY QUOTIENT INDIRA GANDHI DIDN'T HAVE ANY IN LIKE A BIRD AND I DOUBT THE GOLD A MAYOR CARED MUCH ABOUT LIKE A ALLIED WOMEN OF A DIFFERENT AGE ARE YOU REALLY SAYING THAT LIKEABILITY DOESN'T MATTER IN POLITICS I I I ACTUALLY THINK LIKE A BULLET IT DOES MATTER BUT I THINK AUTHENTICITY MADNESS MORE RIGHT SO THOSE WHO SAY ACTUALLY SHE NOW NEEDS TO LOOK LESS TRAINED MORE NATURAL PUT MORE HEART IN IT YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING SHE SHOULD BE WARY OF
NOW I THINK SHE SHOULD AND I THINK THAT THAT SHE DOES HAVE A HEART BUT I DON'T THINK SHE'S FAKE AND WHERE I DO THINK SHE DOES TERRIBLY WELL AND IS AT HER MOST AUTHENTIC IS WHEN SHE'S IN COMBAT THAT IS THE REAL HILARY
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY APPEALING ABOUT BEING ON TOP OF YOUR GAME AND I THINK THAT AS SHE COMPETES FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WITH A CANDIDATE WHO IS TALK ABOUT NO NOTHING I MEAN THE MAN WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CANDIDATE AS IGNORANT AND SHE WILL CONTINUALLY I THINK THEY WERE A HAMMER HIT HIM WITH HER TOTAL MASTERY OF HER GAME TINA BROWN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT CHRIS FOXES HERE WITH WEATHER CHRIS THAT'S ON THERE QUELQU'UN COMPARED WITH YESTERDAY WE'VE GOT A BIT MORE CLOUD AROUND TO START THE DAY BUT THERE WILL BE SOME WARM SUNSHINE COMING THROUGH FOR MOST AREAS COME THE AFTERNOON AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME HEAVY SHOWERS BUT WE WILL BE AS TORRENTIAL AS THOSE THAT BROUGHT SOME FLOODING PROBLEMS FOR EXAMPLE TO BRIGHTON AND TO CROYDON JUST TO NAME TWO AREAS

AS THE RAIN THAT WE HAD YESTERDAY AND WILL BE BIGGER GAPS BETWEEN THOSE SHOWERS TOO SO YOU'VE GOT A BETTER CHANCE OF DODGING THE DOWNPOURS TEMPERATURE WISE WE'RE LOOKING AT HOUSE BETWEEN TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY FIVE DEGREES GENERALLY BUT SUPPOSE COULD COULD SEE HIGHS OF TWENTY SIX OR TWENTY SEVEN IN THE VERY WARMEST AREAS AND IT WILL FEEL QUITE HUMID FOR NORTH EAST ENGLAND AND EASTERN ENGLAND IT SHOULD BE A LARGELY DRY DAY IT'LL BE A LOT OF LOW CLOUD AT TIMES TOWARDS THE NORTH SEA COAST BUT SOME SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH ELSEWHERE TEMPERATURES GENERALLY INTO THE LOW TWENTIES BUT A BIG CALL AROUND THE COASTLINE

IN THE NEXT PROGRAMME THE FORMER FOREIGN SECRETARY LORD HAGUE ON THE CASE FOR BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. AND THE MAN WHO SPENT A YEAR ON THE ISLAND OF LAMPEDUSA WATCHING IT COPE WITH THE MIGRANT CRISIS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH MICHELLE A SANE AND NICK ROBINSON
GOOD MORNING IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE EIGHTH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP TO VOTE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM IN A FINAL SURGE OF VOTER REGISTRATIONS BUT SOME PEOPLE MISSED THE DEADLINE BECAUSE OF TECHNICAL PROBLEMS ON THE SITE
THE WORLD'S MOST WANTED PEOPLE SMUGGLERS BLAME FOR THE DEATH OF HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED WITH THE HELP OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE
HILLARY CLINTON IS CLAIMED VICTORY IN THE BATTLE TO BECOME THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND IMMEDIATELY LAUNCHED AN ATTACK ON HER REPUBLICAN RIVAL DONALD TRUMP THE BEATING HE'S READ THIS MORNING BIKE CHARLES CARROLL
THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN AND OTHER SENIOR M. PEAS SAY VOTER REGISTRATION FOR THE E.U. REFERENDUM SHOULD BE EXTENDED AFTER THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE SUFFERED SERIOUS TECHNICAL PROBLEMS BEFORE LAST NIGHT'S DEADLINE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS HALF A MILLION PEOPLE REGISTERED YESTERDAY AND BLAMED THE DIFFICULTIES ON UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND EMILY HOFF TRIED FOR TWO HOURS TO REGISTER AND ONLY COMPLETED THE PROCESS AFTER THE MIDNIGHT MIDNIGHT DEADLINE
THE WEBSITE WAS JUST COMING UP WITH OUR MESSAGES AND THEN IF YOU EVER DID GET THROUGH IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT THREE MINUTES TO PROFFER A APPEARED AND THEN CRASH AGAIN I'M CONCERNED I'M NOT GOING TO GET TO GO I MEAN I AM THE PERSON WHO BUT OFTEN BUT WITH MOVING HOUSE AND STUFF ABOUT TO RE REGISTER OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALAN SODI REPORTS FROM WESTMINSTER
THIS IS A MAJOR EMBARRASSMENT FOR A GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT INVOLVED IN EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGED VOTERS TO GUESS ON THE ELECTORAL ROLL EVEN AS THE DEADLINE APPROACHED YESTERDAY DAVID CAMERON WAS URGING PEOPLE TO REGISTER BUT WHEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DID THE WEBSITE WAS UNABLE TO COPE
IN ONE FIVE MINUTE PERIOD ALONE THERE WERE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL ATTEMPTS TO CLICK ON THE REGISTRATION FORM THE CABINET OFFICE WHICH HOSTED THE WEBSITE SAID IT HAD ATTEMPTED TO FIX THE TECHNICAL ISSUES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT SOME USERS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS RIGHT UP UNTIL THE DEADLINE
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER TIM FARRON DESCRIBED IT AS A SHAMBLES JEREMY CORBIN WAS AMONG THOSE WHO CALLED FOR AN EXTENSION NEITHER GOVERNMENT NOR THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION HAS YET SAID WHETHER THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
DAVID CAMERON AND NIGEL FARAGE WERE FORCED TO DEFEND SOME OF THEIR CORE POLICIES ON THE E.U. WHEN THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO TOUGH QUESTIONING FROM A TELEVISION AUDIENCE LAST NIGHT A CONSERVATIVE VOTER ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER OF FAILING TO HONOUR HIS PROMISE TO CURB IMMIGRATION WHILE THE UKIP LEADER FACED ALLEGATIONS OF RACISM THIS MORNING UKIP'S ONLY M. P. APPEARED TO CRITICISE MY COMMENTS HE MADE ABOUT THE SEX ATTACKS ON WOMEN IN COLOGNE BY MIGRANTS HERE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
ONCE AGAIN MISTER CAMERON USED TO DEBATE PROGRAMME TO HAMMER HOME HIS ARGUMENTS ON THE ECONOMY AND THE SINGLE MARKET WE CAN SURVIVE BUT CANNOT THRIVE OUTSIDE IT HE SAID AND AGAIN HE URGED VOTERS TO THINK OF THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND THEIR PROSPECTS PRIVATELY HIS AIDES HOPE THESE ARGUMENTS THOUGH REPETITIVE ARE SLOWLY SEEPING THROUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS CAMPAIGN MY CAMERON ALSO RAISED THE PROSPECT OF A SECOND SCOTTISH REFERENDUM SHOULD THE U.K. VOTE FOR BRICKS
ON IMMIGRATION HOWEVER HE WAS MORE VULNERABLE REFUSING TO MAKE FORECASTS ON NUMBERS THE UKIP LEADER WAS ALSO CHALLENGED OVER HIS COMMENTS ABOUT MIGRANTS AND SEX ATTACKS IN COLOGNE HE DISMISSED IT AS A TIDDLY LITTLE ISSUE AND TOLD HIS FEMALE QUESTIONER TO CALM DOWN
SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME HOWEVER THE UKIP M.P. DOUGLAS CARS WELL URGED RESTRAINT WHEN TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MIGRATION IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION YOU NEED TO
AS THE AUDIENCE REMINDED US LAST NIGHT YOU NEED TO USE THE RIGHT TONE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK TO TO RECOGNISE THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT THE UKIP LEADER ALSO APPEARED TO PLAY DOWN CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY SAYING THERE WAS MORE TO HER COUNTRY THAN BEING COMPETITIVE AND THAT NO TRADE DEAL WITH THE E.U. WAS BETTER THAN THE CURRENT ROTTEN DEAL WITH EUROPE
A SURVEY SUGGESTS THAT PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE E.U. HAS FALLEN SHARPLY IN THE TEN LARGEST MEMBER STATES INCLUDING THE U.K. THE PEW RESEARCH CENTRE BASED IN WASHINGTON FOUND THAT ONLY THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF PEOPLE QUESTIONED IN FRANCE HAD A FAVOURABLE VIEW OF THE E.U. DOWN SEVENTEEN POINTS ON LAST YEAR REPORTING FROM BRUSSELS CHRIS MORRIS
ACROSS ALL TEN COUNTRIES SURVEYED THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE EXPRESSING A FAVOURABLE OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS STILL SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSING AN UNFAVOURABLE ONE BUT IT WILL HARDLY COME AS A SURPRISE TO EUROPE'S LEADERS THAT SCEPTICISM IS ON THE RISE THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE NEGATIVE VIEW OF THE E.U. PARTICULARLY IN FRANCE AND SPAIN
A CLEAR MAJORITY ACROSS THE CONTINENT ALSO THOUGHT OF BRITISH EXIT WOULD BE BAD FOR THE E.U. THEY WERE NOT ASKED WHETHER THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BAD FOR THE U.K. AS WELL
ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST WANTED PEOPLE SMUGGLERS WHO'S BEEN BLAMED FOR THE DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS HAS BEEN ARRESTED AFTER BEING TRACKED DOWN IN AN OPERATION INVOLVING BRITISH POLICE AND INTELLIGENCE MARRIED MADE HONEY A THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD ERITREAN NICKNAMED THE GENERAL HAS ALREADY BEEN EXTRADITED TO ITALY FROM SUDAN THEN ENDO REPORTS
REDMOND HANI IS ALLEGED TO BE THE LEADER OF A PEOPLE TRAFFICKING RING RESPONSIBLE FOR SMUGGLING THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN FOR MANY THE TRIP ENDED IN DEATH AS THE BOATS WERE HUGELY OVERCROWDED AND OFTEN NOT SEAWORTHY YET IN ONE TAPED TELEPHONE CALL HE SAID TO HAVE LAUGHED ABOUT THE FATAL OVERLOADING OF THEIR VESSELS HE WAS ARRESTED BY SUDANESE POLICE IN KHARTOUM ON MAY THE TWENTY FOURTH AFTER BEING LOCATED BY THE NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY
WORKING WITH COMMUNICATIONS ANALYSTS AT G.C.H.Q. NEWS OF HIS ARREST WAS ONLY RELEASED FOLLOWING HIS EXTRADITION TO ROME LATE YESTERDAY HE'S WANTED IN ITALY IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEATHS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE PEOPLE OFF THE COAST OF LAMPEDUSA SOUTH OF SICILY IN OCTOBER TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN A FISHING BOAT CARRYING AROUND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE CAUGHT FIRE AND CAPSIZED HE WILL APPEAR BEFORE A JUDGE LATER TO FACE CHARGES INCLUDING PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND THE INHUMAN TREATMENT OF MIGRANTS
THE POLICE WATCHDOG HAS CRITICISED OFFICERS IN SUSSEX FOR USING HANDCUFFS LEG RESTRAINTS AND A MESH WHO'D KNOWN AS A SPIT GUARD ON AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD CHILD WITH A SEVERE NEUROLOGICAL DISABILITY
THE GIRL WAS ARRESTED SEVERAL TIMES DURING TWENTY TWELVE AND HELD IN CUSTODY FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY HOURS OFTEN WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE ADULT THE I.P.C.C. SAID ELEVEN OFFICERS HAD A CASE TO ANSWER FOR MISCONDUCT THE DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SUSSEX POLICE ROBIN SMITH TOLD US THE FORCE STILL USES SPIT GUARDS BUT HAS LEARN FROM ITS MISTAKES
I GENUINELY DO WELCOME THE I.P.C.C. INVESTIGATION GIVEN IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO SUSSEX POLICE AND INDEED I THINK THE POLICE SERVICE HAVE LEARNT SO MUCH MORE ABOUT NOT ONLY HOW WE DEAL WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WITH WITH MENTAL ILL HEALTH BUT ALSO MENTAL HEALTH IN GENERAL AND MAYBE WITH THE COLLEGE POLICING WE START TO REVIEW THE USE OF SPIT GUARDS

A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OF GEAR AND HOME INSTEAD OF FIGHTING BERNIE SANDERS SHE PRAISED HIM TO THE RAFTERS HE'D FOUGHT A GREAT CAMPAIGN WITH ITS FOCUS ON TACKLING INEQUALITY
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WILL BE LOVE BOMBING THE VALMONT SENATOR FROM NOW ON IN A BID TO WIN HIS SUPPORT AND TO UNIFY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IT'S FAR FROM CLEAR WHETHER THAT LOVE WILL BE RECIPROCATED

NOW IT IS A TICKING BOMB IT CAN'T BE DEFUSED IT COULD GO OFF AT ANY MOMENT YOUR TASK IS TO CARRY IT AND DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T NOW WAS THE ADVICE OF A FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER TO HIS SUCCESSOR
DAVID CAMERON THE FORMER LEADER WILLIAM NOW LORD HAIG WAS YOU MIGHT RECALL SEEN AS AN ARCH EURO SCEPTIC WHEN HE DID LEAD THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY BACK IN THE LATE NINETIES TODAY IN A SPEECH LORD HAIG WILL SAY IT IS A TOTAL FANTASY TO CLAIM THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WILL NOT HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR JOBS
AND WE RELEASE MONEY TO SPEND ON THE N.H.S. HE JOINS US FROM OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU LOT ERIC GOOD MORNING THE BOMB'S GONE OFF HASN'T IT IT'S ALREADY WOUNDED THE PRIME MINISTER WOUNDED HIS PROBABLE SUCCESSOR DAMAGE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS ACCORDING TO YOU MAY BE ABOUT TO DO GRAVE DAMAGE TO THE COUNTRY AS WELL WELL IT'S RIGHT TO HAVE A REFERENDUM THIS IS PROFOUNDLY DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY AND I THINK PEOPLE HAVE WANTED TO SAY ON THIS ISSUE OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAS GIVEN IT TO THEM DOES THAT MEAN THERE IS A LOT OF
HEATED DEBATE WELL OF COURSE IT DOES I THINK THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE AND THAT IS ACCEPTED IT'S NOT EXACTLY DEFUSED THE BOMB AS IT HE'S EXPLODED AWAY THAT FRANKLY MOST VOTERS DON'T WELL I DO ENJOY IT THIS IS THE DECISION ONCE PEOPLE HAVE VOTED ON THE TIME IS THAT IT WE WILL HAVE MADE THEIR DECISION ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE YOU OR NOT AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS A STRONG AGENDA FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION WHICH OF COURSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IT
IT UNITES THEM IMPLEMENTS THAT AGENDA LET WRITE RIGHT THAT THIS ISSUE IS BEING ADDRESSED IT'S ALSO RIGHT THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE CLEAR ADVICE FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAD EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD VOTE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING IN MY SPEECH TODAY LET ME PUT TO YOU WHAT MANY PEOPLE SAY I FEAR SO THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION'S IN DANGER OF ACCEPTING WITHOUT A IS POLITICAL DESTINATION AGREED FORTY YEARS AGO OF LIVING IN THE PAST RATHER THAN FACING UP TO THE FUTURE
WE WON SO MANY OF THE BATTLES THAT WE FOR THAT I THOUGHT OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS I KNOW YOUR WORK DO YOU RECOGNISE THEM YEAH I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON YOU'RE FEEDING ME WANT THINGS THAT I'VE SAID IN THE PAST AND I'M EXPLAINING WHY I SAID THAT WOULD YOU JUST BE CLEAR IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE YOU SAID
PUSHING POLITICAL INTEGRATION TWOFOLD MAKE ACCOUNTABILITY IN DEMOCRACY IMPOSSIBLE TO SUSTAIN THEM AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN IS FIRST OF ALL WE WERE THE CAMPAIGN TO KEEP BRITAIN OUT OF THE EURO AND WE'VE WON MANY OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT IN THE SHOW WE'RE NOT IN THE COMMON QUOTA SYSTEM FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS AND THE PRIME MINISTER'S ONE ADDITIONAL THINGS IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR WE'RE NOT PART OF COMMITMENTS TO EVER CLOSER UNION
WE CAN'T BE FORCED INTO GIVING MORE POWERS TO THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW SINCE AN ACT THAT I TOOK FROM PARLIAMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN WITHOUT ANOTHER REFERENDUM OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT NOW DO YOU WANT TO BATTLES IN BRITAIN IN YOUR TERMS I ACCEPT THAT BUT THE WORDS THAT YOU USED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE STILL APPLY IF YOU'RE A EUROSCEPTIC DON'T THEY WHICH IS THAT EUROPE IS IN THE PAST AND NOT FACING UP TO THE FUTURE THAT'S WHAT MAY SCEPTICS THINK
THAT POLITICAL INTEGRATION MEANS THAT THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SUSTAIN NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN EUROPE'S ATTITUDE TO THOSE THINGS WHETHER SOME THINGS HAVE CHANGED FIRST OF ALL WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE PROTECTION FOR THIS COUNTRY AND THAT MAKES IT SAFE AND POSSIBLE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WERE STILL FIGHTING FOR THOSE THINGS BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES BUT SOMETHING ELSE HAS CHANGED THE THING THAT HAS REALLY CHANGED IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT I SET OUT IN MY SPEECH IS THAT THEN WHEN I WAS LEADING THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
ONE OF THE GREAT DANGERS TO THIS COUNTRY WAS DOMINATION BY THE EUROPEAN UNION OF LOSING DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS COUNTRY NOW I BELIEVE A GREATER DANGER IS A FRAGMENTATION OF THE WESTERN WORLD IN THE FACE OF TERRORISM AND MANY OTHER THREATS AND THERE WERE INCLUDING GREAT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND THREATS
AND THE U.K. ARE LEAVING THE YOU WILL CONTRIBUTE TO DIVIDING AS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC TO SPLITTING APART AMERICA EUROPE AND I THINK WHEN WE RAISE OUR EYES FROM PAROCHIAL CONCERNS AND LOOK AT THOSE CHALLENGES OF THE NEXT TWENTY OR THIRTY AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS CHANGED COME WITH TEN OR TWENTY YEARS BUT HE'S IN THE DANGER OF YOUR MESSAGE EFFECTIVELY THAT NOT JUST YOU BUT SENIOR CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN YOUS GET TO FOR SO LONG
OH REALLY SEND THE ELECTORATE SHE'S A THIS IS A PRETTY DREADFUL ORGANISATION IT IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION BUT IT'S JUST FAR TOO RISKY TO LEAVE IT'S A STOMACH IT
WE ARE SAYING I'LL PUT IT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY FROM THAT AS YOU MIGHT THINK THAT WE ARE IN AN IMPERFECT WORLD MANY OF THE CHOICES THAT WE MAKE IN LIFE AND POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE LESSER OF EVILS NO IT'S NOT PRETTY DRESS VERY DREADFUL OH IT'S NOT REALLY GOOD ENOUGH A LOT MORE CHE I REMAIN A CRITIC OF THE EUROPEAN SO MANY OF THE WAYS THAT I HAVE BEEN OVER THE YEARS BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE A COOL HEADED DECISION WHEN IT COMES TO LEAVING IT
AS TO WHETHER IT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE INTERESTS OF THEIR JOBS AND BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR WELL IT MAY BE IN THEIR INTEREST COS THEY WANT TO CURB IMMIGRATION I REMEMBER YOU GETTING A LOT OF FLAK FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT WHEN YOU CUT IT IF YOU DID AND NOW YOU'RE SAYING TO THE COUNTRY HAVING BEEN THE MAN WHO HIGHLIGHTED THE PROBLEM WITH INTEGRATION WITH THE PRESSURE ON PUBLIC SERVICES YOU NOW SAY TO BE ABLE UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION FOR ME SORRY NO CHOICE I'VE GOT TO GO AHEAD
WELL I'M I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M SAYING THAT THIS IS NOT THE ISSUE ON WHICH TO DECIDE HOW TO VOTE IN THIS REFERENDUM OR PEOPLE HAVE PUT FORWARD THE LEAF CAMPAIGN HAVE PUT FORWARD AN AUSTRALIAN STYLE POINTS SYSTEM SOUND SO GOOD DOESN'T IT BUT AUSTRALIA HAS HIGHER IMMIGRATION RELATIVE TO ITS POPULATION THAN WE DO SO REFERENDUM FORGIVE ME IF THEY DON'T USE THE REFERENDUM TO SEND A SIGNAL THEY'VE ALREADY TRIED VOTING FOR A PARTY THAT PROMISED TENS OF THOUSANDS AS ITS TARGET
AND HASN'T MET IT FOR SIX YEARS SO WHY ISN'T IT PERFECTLY RATIONAL FOR A CONSERVATIVE VOTER LIKES WHAT YOU PROMISED LIKES WHAT YOU SAID NOTICED THAT YOU'RE NOT DELIVERING IT TO SAY O.K. I WILL VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. BECAUSE THAT IS AT LEAST A STEP CLOSER TO WHAT I WANT
THIS REFERENDUM IS NOT ABOUT SENDING SIGNALS IT IS ABOUT MAKING A DECISION THAT WILL AFFECT PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS AND FUTURE FOR DECADES TO COME AND THE REASON IS AS AS I WAS JUST GOING ON TO EXPLAIN PARTLY BECAUSE ALTERNATIVES MIKE THAT MIGHT LEAD TO HIGHER OR LOWER IMMIGRATION PARLOUR BECAUSE IF YOU USE LEAVING THE Y. YOU AS A MEANS OF CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION IT AFFECTS ALL THOSE BRITISH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE OR WORK OR STUDY ACROSS THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH VERY LARGE NUMBERS
AND PARTLY BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER SECURED CHANGES TO HER BENEFIT SYSTEM SO THAT E.U. MIGRANTS HERE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMY BUT THEY TAKE THAT SAYS HE CONCEDED YESTERDAY HE'S GOT NO FORECAST FOR IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WELL AMBER'S TELLING A LOT OF SUPPORT WHEN YOU TAKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT BUT IMMIGRATION IS NOT THE ISSUE ON WHICH TO DECIDE AT THIS REFERENDUM IT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE FUTURE AND THAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
UNDERSTAND IT IS WHAT IS BETTER FOR THAT THAT FUTURE UNITY OF WESTERN NATIONS WORKING TOGETHER IN THE FACE OF SO MANY THREATS AND AN UNSTABLE WORLD OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS THE ARGUMENT OF MY SPEECH TODAY BUT TAKE MY POINT WHICH IS THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT I DO WANT TO MAKE A DECISION ON THE BASIS OF IMMIGRATION AND YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING TO THEM YOU COULD FOR EXAMPLE SAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD VITO
THE MEMBERSHIP OF TURKEY IN THE FUTURE AND INDEED ANY OTHER COUNTRY UNTIL FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IS CURVED AND HERE TO USE FOREIGN SECRETARY SAID I GIVE FULL SUPPORTS YOUR FOR HIS FULL SUPPORT FOR TURKEY TO JOIN THE INTERVIEW WILL LOOK VERY WELL NICK THAT THERE AREN'T ANY COUNTRIES AT THE MOMENT ANYWHERE NEAR JOINING THE EUROPEAN UNION SO WHY NOT JUST RULED IT OUT WHY DON'T YOU SIMPLY SAY
THIS GOVERNMENT WOULD NEVER BACK TURKISH MEMBERSHIP UNLESS CONDITIONS DRAMATICALLY CHANGE WELL SOME GOOD REASONS WHICH IS WHERE YOU NEED TO ENCOURAGE STRONG LIMITED TO ENCOURAGE GREATER DEMOCRACY IN TURKEY GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN TURKEY AND THE REST OF THE E.U. IT ISN'T POSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE MIGRATION CRISIS AFFECTING THE MEDITERRANEAN WITHOUT CO OPERATION BETWEEN THE E.U. AND TURKEY SO YOU'LL HAVE YOUR SAY IN A WAY THEY THEY WOULD REACT SO BADLY TO IT
THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU MEAN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO JOIN THE PEOPLE IN ISTANBUL HAVE TO BLAME THAT WHAT YOU REALLY BELIEVE IS THEY ARE WELL I THINK THEY HAVE TO BELIEVE US SOME FRAMEWORK OF CO OPERATION WITH THE EUROPEAN OPEN TO THEM IN THE FUTURE I'VE ADVOCATES HAD SOME KIND OF ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP FOR TURKEY AND A LONG TERM FUTURE BUT THIS IS LONG TERM YOU KNOW THERE ARE THIRTY FIVE OR SO CHAPTERS OF NEGOTIATION BETWEEN TOOK EMILY
AND ONLY ONE OR TWO OF THEM HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND SETTLED SO FAR TURKISH MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. IS NOT ON THE CARDS IT IS RIGHT FOR US TO BE OPEN TO TALKING TO TALK TO TURKEY BUT IT'S NOT ON THE CARD IS AGAIN NOT SOMETHING ON WHICH PEOPLE SHOULD BE DECIDING HOW TO VOTE IN THIS REFERENDUM THERE IS A PROBLEM ISN'T THERE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE ADVISING PEOPLE HOW THEY SHOULD NOT MAKE A DECISION WHETHER IT'S ON TURKEY WHETHER IT'S ON THE ECONOMY WHICH I ACCEPT IS THE FOCUS OF YOUR SPEECH TODAY YOU'RE TENDING TO SAY TRUST US
TRUST ESTABLISHMENT TRUST THE EXPERTS WE KNOW WE KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DECIDE ON WE KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD DECIDE AND THE DIFFICULTY WHICH YOU KNOW ONLY TOO WELL IS THEY DON'T TRUST YOU NOT YOU PERSONALLY AND INTEREST ESTABLISHMENT WELL ACTUALLY WHAT I'M SAYING IS DECIDE ON THE BASES OF GOOD SOUND COMMON SENSE IF YOU ARE RUNNING A BUSINESS
ARE YOU MORE OR LESS LIKELY TO INVEST IN THE U.K. IF YOU HEAR THAT WE ARE LEAVING THE BIGGEST SINGLE MARKET IN THE WORLD THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE AS NIGEL FARRAJ PUT IT LAST NIGHT ON THE TELEVISION LIKE AMERICA WELL AMERICA CAN HAVE TEN PER CENT PUT ON IT'S ANY CAR EXPORTS TO THE E.U. OR FIVE PER CENT ON CHEMICALS OR TWENTY PER CENT ON WHISKY SO ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT MORE OR LESS FROM BRITAIN IN THAT SITUATION
LESS OBVIOUSLY AND THAT MEANS FEWER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE EMPLOYED IN BRITAIN AND THAT HAS A REAL IMPACT ON EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THIS COUNTRY NOT THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE SO I'M SAYING BASE YOUR DECISION ON THAT GOOD SOUND COMMON SENSE NOT A WILLY MAKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISTENING TO THAT OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA BEG A WHAT ABOUT REGISTRATION IN THE SECOND LAURA BUT FIRST OF ALL ONCE AGAIN WILLIAM HAGUE THOSE IN THERE REMAIN CAMPED DESPERATE REALLY TO SAINT LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION SHALL WE TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY INSTEAD
INDEED AND WE HEAR THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN WHENEVER THE QUESTION IS PUT THEY TRIED TO DRIVE US BACK TO THE CENTRAL MESSAGE THAT THEY ARE HAVING CENTRALLY DON'T TAKE THE RISK WITH OUR MONEY OUR CASH OUR WALLETS IN THE POUNDS AND PENCE IN OUR POCKETS AND I THINK THE PRIME MINISTER WILL ALSO USE PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS SORT OF TREMORS THAT THEY'VE BEEN AROUND A CURRENCY MARKETS WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO THE POUND IN THE SUGGESTIONS ALREADY IN THE MARKETS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF PEOPLE DEFY HIM AND ACTUALLY VOTE TO LEAVE TO THAT'S EXCELLENT FORGIVE ME BUT THERE TO THAT EXTENT
RATHER CLOSE POLES AND THOSE MOVEMENTS ON THE CURRENCY MARKETS MAY UNNERVE THE REMAIN CAMP THEY'RE NOT HELPFUL ARE THEY WELL THEY CERTAINLY UNDERLINED THE MESSAGE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT ACROSS A WIDOW ALSO SAY THEY WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND SOME OTHER COMMENTATORS HAVE BEEN SAYING MYSTERIOUS RATHER UNPRECEDENTED TO HAVE THE CHANCELLOR AND TODAY I EXPECT THE PRIME MINISTER STANDING UP AND TALKING ABOUT THINGS GOING BADLY WRONG FOR THE CURRENCY THAT SOMETHING THAT NORMALLY PRIME MINISTER'S WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR IT
A SIGN OF REALLY JUST HOW SERIOUS THIS ALL IS FOR THEN POLITICALLY HOW MUCH THEIR CAREER'S AT STAKE AND HOW MUCH THEY FEEL THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO WIN TALK IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG WE HAD THAT REGISTRATION VOTES WEBSITE FORGIVE ME FOR VOTERS DESPERATE TO GET ON AT THE LAST MINUTE LAST NIGHT CRASHING
INDEED AND I THINK THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OF DESCRIBING THAT AS A HORROR LEX YOU HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AS THE CLOCK TICK DOWN TO MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET THEIR DETAILS PROCESSED BY THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE WE'VE NOW GOT THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY THE LABOUR PARTY AND THE LIB DEMS CALLING FOR THIS TO BE EXTENDED BASICALLY THEY DON'T WANT TO GO INTO A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE DENIED A VOTE IN THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE COMPUTER SAYS NO THE GOVERNMENT THIS MORNING I THINK HE'S LOOKING AT WAYS OF SEEING IF PRACTICALLY AND LEGALLY THEY CAN EXTEND THE DEADLINE
NOT JUST KEEN TO DO THAT OF COURSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO DENY ANYBODY THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE IN IT'LL MAKE PEOPLE EXTREMELY GRUMPY IF THEY ARE BUT ALSO IN WHAT MANY PEOPLE EXPECT WILL BE A TIGHT RESULT ANYTHING THAT WILL ENABLE PEOPLE TO CRY FOUL AFTERWARDS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO ALLOW HAPPEN LAURA THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT THAT AND EIGHT THIRTY INCLUDING WITH TIM FARRON THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER

MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARRIVE BY BOAT ON THE ITALIAN COAST LAST YEAR MANY OF THEM LANDING ON THE TINY MEDITERRANEAN ISLAND OF LAMPEDUSA ITS NATIVE POPULATION IS ONLY AROUND FIVE THOUSAND BUT IT IS AT THE FRONT LINE OF THE MIGRATION CRISIS HANDLING THE LIVING AS WELL AS THE DEAD
ITALIAN FILMMAKER JOHN FRANKEL ROSIE SPENT A YEAR THERE LOOKING AT THE EFFECT ON LOCAL PEOPLE'S LIVES HE'S BEEN TALKING TO US ALONGSIDE DOCTOR ANNA ARE KNOWN IT FROM THE SCHOOL OF ORIENTAL AND AFRICAN STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON ARE JOHN FRANCO EXPLAINED FIRST HOW HE FIRST BECAME INTERESTED IN WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON LAMPEDUSA
THERE WAS A MOMENT IN THAT DAY SEAN WAS EXTREMELY FOCUS ON LEARNED SINGS WERE FIRST THAN WHEN THERE WAS THIS BIG WAVE FROM PEOPLE FROM NORTH AFRICA WHEN THERE WAS A SPIRITED ARAB SPRING AND THEN AFTER THAT WAS HIS HUGE TRAGEDY ON THE THIRD OF OCTOBER
AT THIRTEEN YOU'RE SHOPPING YOU'RE FIVE HUNDRED SIX PEOPLE DIED A LITTLE SAILED SO LIKE IT WAS
OH O.K. SEE YOU UP AND IT WAS A LOT OF THAT THERE SHALL WE LUMP IT WAS IN THAT PERIOD BUT SOMEHOW ALWAYS ATTENTION WAS BEING RELATED TO A TRAGEDY ON TO SOME KIND OF DISASTER AND THERE WAS ALSO NEEDS TO SHOW LUMP IT WAS HAS AN ISLAND WITH ITS OWN AND BITTER AND PEOPLE LEAVING AND SO THAT'S HOW IT'S ALL STARTED IN THE BEGINNING WAS LIKE A SMALL PROJECT BUT THEN THERE ARE LES IMMEDIATELY WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL THE STORY LIKE THAT AND YOU ENDED UP STAYING FOR A YEAR AND UP SAY FOR IT
DOCTOR ANNA OH NO NO WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE WAY THE LAMPEDUSA'S PORTRAYED WHAT I REALLY APPRECIATED IS THAT HE MANAGED TO TO GET OUT THE CONTRADICTION THE CONTRA POSITION BETWEEN AT THE SEA
WHERE THE MIGRANTS DIE INLAND IN THE NIGHT THERE'S A MARINE BOAT GOING TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND THEN THERE'S A FISHERMAN AT NIGHT
GOING TO LOOK FOR FISH
AND YOU KIND OF EXPECT THE FISHERMEN TO FIND A DEAD BODY THERE'S THIS KIND OF ANXIETY YEAH IT DOES REALLY FILM ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF THE ISLAND THEN THE MIGRANTS
WELL HE'S I THINK I I CAN SEE THE PARALLEL AND THAT THE PARALLEL WORLDS THAT NEVER NEVER TOUCH AND THERE'S NO MORE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE POPULATION AND THAT MIGRANTS ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE ARRIVING TO THE POOR TO THE TAKING WITH THE BUS INTO THE CENTRE IDENTIFIED THERE ON THE FIRST POD
IDENTIFICATION CENTRE THAT A RELIEF TO THE SORTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN YOUR FILM WELL THEY'RE NOT PHIL YEP I'D LUMP IDYLLS AND THEY'LL BE THE ALWAYS EMBRACING THESE THEY NEVER COMPLAINED THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWENTY YEARS AND NOBODY DOES NOBODY TALKED ABOUT LOVE COULD LOSE HER BEING SO MATT'S AT SUCH A PLACE WHERE IT WAS INCLUDING PEOPLE PASSING BY BUT NOW A CHANGE BECAUSE THAT IS SOMEHOW ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN USED TO CHANEL ISED
AND IT CHANGED THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE POPULATION AND SOMEHOW AND WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHY I DO TWO THINGS IN THEIR EVER ENCOUNTERED BECAUSE THEY DON'T SO THERE IS TWO REALITY TO THE ISLAND AS THE MIGRANTS AND THE DISC THE DISC TO ENTITY THAT NEVER A TOUCH
SO THERE'S LIKE ALMOST THE SEPARATION WHICH SOMEHOW IS A METHOD FOR RED NOW DOES A FILM LIKE THIS HELP US UNDERSTAND THE MIGRANT CRISIS IF THAT IS POSSIBLE OR HELPERS HAVE SYMPATHY FOR FOR THOSE WHO WERE IN SUCH PERIL ON THE SEA I BELIEVE THERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE MIGRATION CRISISES THAT MIGRANTS ARE NEVER INDIVIDUALS STARE THEN NEVER HEROES SO
A FILM LIKE THIS SHOWS THE TRAGEDY AND TRACKER SHOWS THE APPARATUS THAT HELPS THEM LIKE THE DOCTOR
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU OR FOR ANYBODY TO ACTUALLY TELL THE STORIES OF THE MIGRANTS ONE BY ONE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE AGAIN IF I BUY A LOT OF THINGS THEY DON'T HAVE A BUTLER I A STORY INTO INTO THREE AND THAT IS I THINK IT'S VERY STRONG ON THAT WHICH IS THE MOMENT WITH A GROUP OF THE LEDGER THEY WERE RESCUED THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA OFTEN WITH ANOTHER TRAGEDY WAS ABLE TO SPEND TWO OR THREE DAYS WITH THEM IN THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE THEY DISRUPT CHANTING THAT'S ONE DOWN
YEAH GOOD
ONE OF THE MOST EPIC OIL AND SOMEHOW IT INCLUDES ALL THAT PAUL SYBIL STORY YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY IN IT REPRESENTATIONAL BOTH HOUSE HOW VIOLENT THEY ARE HAAS WAS WHO HAD THEIR DRAWING
GOOD NOW WE ARE LOW IT'S LIKE AN M.P. CALLED MOMENT IN DE FEUM EFFING THINGS WHICH INCLUDE IN SITTERS EYES OF THE DRAMA WHERE THEY THINK THE FEE ONCE TO SAY MORSE LITTLE CRAYON IN THERE WERE SENT TO SAY THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT NUMBER AND WHEN YOU WIN CAN'T TO DEATH SUDDENLY YOU KNOW WE USED TO HEAR HER NUMBERS TRYING TO INFUSE DITTA UNDER PEOPLE THERE ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE DAY AND WHILST YOU SEE DEATH ONCE ENCOUNTERED THAT YOUR ELIZA'S DISA INDIVIDUAL AND ONLY ONE PERSON BAG IS TOO MUCH

ONE OR TWO HEAVY SHOWERS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND TO MICHELLE HUSSEIN TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE CHARLES CARROLL HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS SENIOR M. PEAS HAVE CALLED FOR VOTERS TO BE GIVEN MORE TIME TO REGISTER ON LINE TO TAKE PART IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE REGISTRATION WEBSITE SUFFERED TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AS YESTERDAY'S MIDNIGHT DEADLINE APPROACHED THE CABINET OFFICE HAS APOLOGISED BLAMING UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND
DAVID CAMERON AND THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL FARRAJ FACE TOUGH QUESTIONING ON IMMIGRATION AND THE ECONOMY IN A PRIME TIME T.V. PROGRAMME ABOUT THE E.U. REFERENDUM LAST NIGHT THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER LORD HAIG WAS ONCE REGARDED AS A STRONG EURO SCEPTIC HE TOLD US IMMIGRATION SHOULD NOT BE THE ISSUE ON WHICH THE REFERENDUM WAS DECIDED
I WANTED PEOPLE SMUGGLER HAS BEEN ARRESTED AFTER BEING TRACTOR TO SUDAN BY BRITISH LAW OFFICERS READ MADE HONEY KNOWN AS THE GENERAL HAS BEEN BLAMED FOR THE DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
ELEVEN OFFICERS WITH SUSSEX POLICE HAVE BEEN CRITICISED FOR USING RESTRAINTS WHILE ARRESTING A SCHOOLGIRL WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THE IVC HE SAID THAT THEY HAD A CASE TO ANSWER FOR MISCONDUCT AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS CLAIMED VICTORY IN THE RACE TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BUT HER RIVAL BERNIE SANDERS HAS VOWED TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THE NOMINATION
IT'S TWENTY FIVE TO NINE SOON AFTER TEN O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT PEOPLE TRYING TO USE THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE TO REGISTER TO VOTE STARTED REPORTING PROBLEMS SOME NEVER COMPLETED THEIR REGISTRATION BEFORE MIDNIGHT THE DEADLINE FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO VOTE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM THIS WAS THE EXPERIENCE OF TWENTY YEAR OLD EMILY HOFF FROM MIDDLESBROUGH
I'M MOVING HOUSE BETWEEN NATHAN FOR UNIVERSITIES I REGISTERED AND THEN I'VE GOT A LETTER A COUPLE OF DAYS ACROSS THEN I HAD TO RE REGISTERED LAST MAY I WAS WATCHING THE DEBATE BETWEEN NADJA FARRAJ AND DAVID CAMERON AND IT REMINDS ME OF
I WANT A LOCK ONTO THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE AND IT WASN'T WORKING I MANAGED
TWELVE SO I'M NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN COUNTED ON THAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL HAVE GOT ON LAST MINUTE LAST NIGHT I DON'T NEED TO I NEED TO GET DONE
AND I DO THINK THAT THERE WILL BE QUITE HARSH AND I MEAN IT COULD BE BETWEEN WHERE THEY RELIEVE THE WEATHER WE STAY IN THE E.U.
WELL DOWNING STREET HAS SAID THIS MORNING THAT IT IS LOOKING AT WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE AND LEGAL TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE WE'RE JOINED FROM WESTMINSTER BY THE LEADER OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS TIM FARRON GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN I THINK THE EXTENSION SHOULD BE FOR AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND I IT IS LEGAL IT IS POSSIBLE WITHIN THE LEGISLATION IT IS SAID THAT FOR THIS REFERENDUM THE DEADLINE WAS MIDNIGHT AT THE END OF YESTERDAY HOWEVER
THE GOVERNMENT REGULARLY USES ORDERS IN COUNCIL THAT'S TREE INSTRUMENT IN ORDER TO RUSH THROUGH EMERGENCY LEGISLATION VERY OFTEN IN MY VIEW FOR VERY WRONG REASONS IN AN ANTI DEMOCRATIC WAY HERE OR BE A LOVELY EXCEPTION WE DID IT FOR A VERY DEMOCRATIC REASON THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE CERTAINLY HER GENERATION MAYBE IN PEOPLE'S LIFETIME AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING THEIR BEST TO GET THEMSELVES REGISTERED AND THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN HAVE BEEN FOUND THAT THEY'VE BEEN
KICKED OUT OUGHT TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AT LEAST UNTIL MIDNIGHT TONIGHT RIGHT SO JUST TO BE CLEAR ARE YOU SAYING EXTENDED SO THAT ANYONE WHO HAS AN REGISTERED HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVEN BEGIN THE PROCESS WILL JUST THOSE WHO HAD PROBLEMS LAST NIGHT ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY HAS A PROBLEM WITH MAKING HOW WOULD YOU KNOW EXAM THESE PROCESS WAS UNDERWAY ALREADY I MEAN MY SENSES THAT YOU SHOULD JUST EXTEND THE DEADLINE FOR ANYBODY FOR ANOTHER TWENTY FOUR HOURS
I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK WE HEARD FROM EMILY JUST THERE WHO HER REASONS WERE VERY VERY SOUND VERY STRING AS LATE SHE DID BUT EVEN IF SHE HAD NO OTHER REASON OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT SHE HAD SEEN THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT AND WANTED TO REGISTER AT THE LAST MINUTE THAT'S A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE THING TO WANT TO DO IT SEEMS ANECDOTALLY THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY AT THESE PEOPLE DESPERATELY TRYING TO REGISTER FOR A VOTE
WERE YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK YOU'D BE A TERRIBLE THING IF THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE A DEMOCRACY THEY WERE ABORTED BECAUSE OF THE BANALITY OF A TECHNICAL GLITCH THAT MIGHT BUT THAT CONFIDENCE IN DEMOCRACY IN THE FUTURE YES AND CLEARLY THERE WAS A TECHNICAL GLITCH BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF HAVING A DEADLINE FOR REGISTRATION IN ALLOWING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME OR BETWEEN THAT DEADLINE AND THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT
THAT PERSON TO VOTE IS IMPORTANT ISN'T IT ALLOWS THE CHEQUES TO TAKE PLACE A BOY'S ELECTORAL FRAUD IT'S THERE FOR A REASON YES IT IS THERE FOR A REASON IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS A REGISTRATION DEADLINE IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE WHERE ONE HAD BASICALLY ONE OPPORTUNITY A YEAR TO VIA SNAIL MAIL REGISTER AND GET YOURSELF ONTO THE ELECTORAL ROLE HOWEVER HE SEEMS VERY VERY WRONG THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE IT MAY BE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MOST IT WOULD SEEM YOUNG PEOPLE
COULD BE DISENFRANCHISED AND NOT ABLE TO TAKE PART IN THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE IN A GENERATION OR MORE BECAUSE OF THE TECHNICAL GLITCH IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING IN EMERGENCY LEGISLATION SO I PUT THEM IN URGENT QUESTION THIS MORNING THERE HAS A COMMON WHICH I HOPE WILL BE CALLED TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT THE ABILITY TO DO JUST THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH THEIR DECISION TO STAY OR LEAVE
WILL AFFECT THE MOST AND FOR THE LONGEST AND FOR THE MORE LIKELY IT'S GENERALLY THOUGHT TO VOTE ON THE SIDE DO YOU SUPPORT REMAIN I GUESS THAT'S TRUE IT AND EATS IT SHOULDN'T BE SHOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE FOR ALL OF US FROM MY AGENT UPWARDS THAT THERE SEEM TO BE VERY LARGE MAJORITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE WANTING TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND GIVEN IT'S THEIR FUTURE WE'RE VOTING FOR WE REALLY OUGHT TO GIVE MORE ATTENTION THAN NORMAL TO WHAT THEY WANT TIM FARRON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE SUFFER A STROKE IF YOU IF YOUR BRAIN IS TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF RECOVERING YOU ARE IN EFFECT IN A RACE AGAINST TIME THAT IS WHAT PATIENTS HAVE LONG BEEN WARMED THE CHANCE OF RECOVERING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS CAN BE GOOD NOT SO MUCH AFTERWARDS HOWEVER A NEW EXPERIMENT INVOLVING INJECTING STEM CELLS INTO THE DAMAGED PART OF THE BRAIN IS OFFERING NEW HOPE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO PROFESSOR GARY STONE BIRD WHOSE CHARA NEUROSURGERY AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY
THIS WAS A BIG SURPRISE TO US WE THOUGHT THAT PATIENTS RECOVER A LITTLE BIT OVER SIX MONTHS AND THEN THEY CAN'T RECOVER MORE BECAUSE WE WE FELT THAT THE CIRCUITS WERE DARED OR IRREVERSIBLY DAMAGED AND WHAT WE LEARNT FROM THIS IS THAT THE CIRCUITS ARE NOT DEAD THEY CAN BE RESURRECTED WERE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE JACK WE HELD TO RESURRECT THEM BUT THIS WAS A BIG SURPRISE TO KINK IS A TRADITIONAL NOTION OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A STROKE AND MAYBE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER OTHER KINDS OF INJURY OR DISORDERS OF THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD
SO THE STEM CELLS ARE INJECTED INTO THE BRAIN WHAT'S SCIENTIFICALLY ARE THEY DOING EFFECTIVELY TURNING THE CLOCK BACK ARE THEY ON SOME BRAIN CELLS TWENTY YEARS AGO WE THOUGHT THAT THESE STEM CELLS WOULD ACTUALLY IT NEURONS AND INTEGRATE INTO THE BRAIN AND THEN RECAST TO CIRCUIT THAT CIRCUS THAT'S NOT HOW THEY WORK WHAT THEY DO IS TO SECRETE VERY POWERFUL GROWTH FACTORS EDGY GENESIS FACTORS PROTEINS AND MOLECULES THAT
BASICALLY IT HAD NEED OF MECHANISMS OF RECOVERY SO IN A SENSE THEY CURRENTLY A DOG BRINGING IN TO EAT NEAR NEEDLE OR INFANT BRAIN WHICH RECOVERS VERY WELL AFTER A STROKE OR OTHER INJURY ONE PATIENT RECOVERED SO WELL SHE WENT ON TO GET MARRIED YEAH AND WHO WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE SHE WAS PARALYSED ON THE RIGHT SIDE SHE RECOVERED TO THE POINT SHE COULD WALK BUT WITH A VERY BAD LIMP COULD NOT MOVE HER ARM COULD NOT SPEAK AND COMMUNICATE WELL
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GET MARRIED HE SHOE BUT SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE AND HAVE TO EAT TRANSFORMED FURNITURE WITH THE STEM CELLS SHE I WAS ABLE TO MOVE HER ARM LIFTED OVERHEAD MOVE IT AROUND SHE COULD WALK MUCH MUCH BETTER HER SPEECH WAS VERY UNDERSTANDABLE AND IT'S ACTUALLY GOT MARRIED NOW SHE'S PREGNANT AND FINALLY THIS IS QUITE A SMALL SCALE EXPERIMENT PRESUMING IT IS MUCH MUCH TOO EARLY FOR PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS TREATMENT ANY TIME SOON
WELL YOU'RE RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO OVERSELL THIS AND THERE'S A LOT OF HYPE AROUND STEM CELLS BUT THIS RECOVERY WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS QUITE A STARTLING TO US AND IF THIS PANS OUT IN LARGER TRIALS AND WE HOPE IT DOES WE'RE STARTING A TRIAL RIGHT NOW WITH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX PATIENTS INCLUDING THAT CONTROL THAT WOULD GET THE NEEDLE AT THE CELLS AT THIS PANS OUT IN THESE LARGER TRIALS THEN IT WOULD TOTALLY TRANSFORMED THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC STROKE PROFESSOR STEINBERG THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WHEN THE NORTHERN IRELAND FOOTBALL TEAM PLAY POLAND IN ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES OF EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS WEEKEND IT'LL BE THEIR FIRST MATCH IN A MAJOR TOURNAMENT IN THIRTY YEARS IN THE PAST MOST OF THE TEAM SUPPORTERS COME FROM THE PROTESTANT COMMUNITY WITH MANY PEOPLE FROM NATIONALIST AREAS SUPPORTING THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
PLAYERS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE DIVIDE PLAY IN THE CURRENT NORTHERN IRELAND TEAM AND THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES HAVE MADE BIG EFFORTS IN RECENT YEARS TO TACKLE SECTARIANISM OUR IRELAND CORRESPONDENT CHRIS PAGE REPORT FROM BELFAST
PLAYING ON HOST NATION IN THOSE SUPER CHARGED ATMOSPHERE IS NOT DAUNTING
THE IRISH ARE TRYING TO CHANGE HISTORY
NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO WORLD CUP IN SPAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND'S MOST MOMENTOUS FOOTBALLING ACHIEVEMENTS
IT WAS ISOLATED WITH A ONE ON ONE AGAINST AND I PUT ME ARM OUT PEOPLE SAID IT WAS A FOUR HOUR NICE BUT WASN'T I LEVERED HIM BEHIND ME AND GIVE ME THAT HALF A YARD ACROSS
IT WAS THE MOST FAMOUS SCHOOL IN NORTHERN IRELAND'S HISTORY GIVING THEM A WIN WITH THE HOST'S BACK HOME THE TROUBLES WERE AT THEIR HEIGHT BUT THE VICTORY CAUSED HUGE CELEBRATIONS AS BILLY HAMILTON REMEMBERS
I THINK PEOPLE FORGOT A POLITICAL VIEWPOINT FOR ALL THOSE KIAN'S AND THEY WISH AS WELL SPORT IS A GREAT MEDIUM FOR DOING BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER
BUT HERE SPORTING IDENTITY COULD STILL BE A GAME OF
IN THE URALS MANY PEOPLE FROM THE NATIONALIST COMMUNITY WILL BE SUPPORTING THE OTHER TEAM FROM IRELAND REALLY SUPPORT OF EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS FROM MOANING ABOUT I AM WELL THAT'S ALL
TEAM WILL BE SUPPORTING THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS PUBLIC OF IRELAND THE REPUBLIC GOT KNOCKED OUT NOT THAT I'VE GOT FURTHER WITH YOUR SUPPORT NORTHERN ALAN
YOU BE SUPPORTING THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS HOLDING ABOUT WHEN THEY WENT NORTHERN IRELAND COME ON WHAT ABOUT THEM YOU GET A BIT OF WINDSOR PARK SUBURB HERE POLLY LAD I THINK MATTERS
AND ALAN'S HOME STADIUM WINDSOR PARK
HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A WELCOMING PLACE FOR PEOPLE WHO FEEL MORE IRISH THAN BRITISH AND THERE WAS A TIME WHEN SECTARIAN SINGING AND CHANTING WAS PUTTING OFF MANY OTHERS TO MICHAEL BOYD IS THE DIRECTOR OF FOOTBALL DEVELOPMENT FOR SOCCER'S GOVERNING BODY HERE THE IRISH FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION
ALWAYS BE BACK IN MY FIRST EVER INTERNATIONAL MOTOR WAS IN APRIL I THINK TWO THOUSAND WE HAD ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF THOUSAND PEOPLE MIGHT BEGIN TO IT APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND
JUST GENERAL GOOD PEOPLE AND FAMILIES HAVE VOTED WITH THEIR FEET ONE CONNECT HIM WITH TEAM
A LOW POINT CAME IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THE NORTHERN IRELAND CAPTAINED ME LENNON CATHOLIC RETIRED FROM INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL AFTER HE RECEIVED A DEATH THREAT OF ENJOYMENT THROUGH I DID THE NATIONAL LEVEL BUT IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SAY
CAMPION AGAINST SECTARIANISM CALLED FOOTBALL FOR ALL GATHERED PIERCE THERE WERE SCHEMES TO BRING TOGETHER FOOTBALLERS FROM ACROSS THE DIVIDE
THE TERRACES GREEN AND WHITE BECAME THE COLOURS OF CHOICE INSTEAD OF THE RED WHITE AND BLUE THE UNION FLAG
CHILLY ACROSS THE ORGANISATION I THINK THE NORTHERN MARATHON FOOTBALL EXAMPLES
IS A MODEL OF THE POINTS OF SOCIETY IN THE MOMENT
THIS IS ONE SIGN OF HIGH THINGS HAVE CHANGED AT THE SORT GALLERY POSTERS OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND PLAYERS ARE ON SHOW
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PUT UP IN THE FOOTBALL THIS HOME TOWNS AND VILLAGES
ONE OF THEM SCREWING UP AND DONNA MORE THAT'S MAINLY CATHOLIC VILLAGE TWENTY TWO ROOMS WITH A WINGER I'LL BEGIN IT'S FROM
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FLOP ON THE JEAN THERE NOW AS WELL AND DANCES FOR YOURSELF THAN ON THE COAST
THERE'S A BATTERY ON THERE SO SHE JUST SHOWS SO WELL PEOPLE ARE IN ON THE BETJEMAN HEY WELL WITHIN
THE FOOTBALL AND FAULT LINES HAVEN'T DISAPPEARED
BUT THE BEAUTIFUL GAME IS NO LONGER ECLIPSED BY AN UGLY SIDE
POLITICAL LEADERS THINK IT'S A BIG STEP FORWARD THE FIRST MINISTER IS THE DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST ENFORCED
IT IS TREMENDOUS TO SEE THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ENGLAND
THE WHEELS AND OURSELVES AT THE AERIALS AND PEOPLE FROM RIGHT ACROSS THE COMMUNITY AND I GETTING BEHIND THE NORTHERN IRELAND TEAM AND I THINK THAT'S WONDERFUL I THINK IT'S
THE DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER SIMPKINS MARTIN MCGUINNESS IS AN IRISH REPUBLICAN
BUT HE'S WISHING NORTHERN IRELAND WELL
THE REPUBLIC BUT LET'S PUT IT LIKE THIS IF IF THE LORD
WAS ON THE FINAL ROOMS EVERYTHING MCGILL SOME MORPHINE SO I WOULD BE A SETTEE IDIOTIC THE BRIDGE PUDDING I WAS I WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM I WILL SUPPORT ANYBODY THAT'S WHERE ARE THE GOOD
CHRIS PAID REPORTING FROM BELFAST THERE IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE BODY OF A SEVENTY YEAR OLD HINDU PRIEST WAS FOUND IN A FIELD NEAR HIS TEMPLE IN BANGLADESH THIS WEEK HE HAD BEEN BEHEADED IN AN ATTACK CLAIMED BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THAT HAS BEEN DISPUTED BY THE BANGLADESHI GOVERNMENT BUT THERE ARE REAL FEARS ABOUT THE RISE OF EXTREMISM IN A COUNTRY WHERE A SERIES OF DEADLY ATTACKS HAVE TARGETED SECULAR BLOGGERS ACADEMICS
GAY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS AND OTHERS WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE HIGH COMMISSIONER BANGLADESH IN LONDON THE DEAN PARDO GOOD MORNING MONEY AND IF IT IS NOT ISLAMIC STATE OR THAT DID THIS THEN WHO IS IT WELL WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IN MY PRIME MINISTER AS CATEGORY HE'S SAID NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THERE WITH THE POLICE INVESTIGATION HAS LED TO TWO FINDINGS ONE IS THE BAND LOCAL THERESE GREW RICH FROM WANDERING TO T'OTHER ONE SIXTH REGIMENT HAVE BEEN IN THE GOVERNMENT

WHAT CAUGHT MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN RUSTICATED STILL BUT WE ARE ON IT SO THAT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY O.K. SO YOU KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE AND YET IN THIS SERIES OF KILLINGS MORE THAN TWENTY PEOPLE INCLUDING PROFESSORS MEMBERS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES TO FOREIGNERS OFTEN THEY'RE HACKED TO DEATH WITH MACHETES IN SOME CASES THEY ARE BEHEADED
THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE CONVICTION FOR ANY OF THESE CRIMES IF YOU KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE THEN WHY HAVEN'T THEY BEEN BROUGHT UP IT'S A COURT PROCESS WITH END IN THE COURTS ARE VERY INDEPENDENT SO YOU MUST KNOW THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THE WHOLE
AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS BEING CORRECTED BE UPGRADED FOR THE DELIVERY OF JUSTICE IS FASTER BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S TAKING TIME
I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE PLANE HERE IN THAT IT'S NOT A SIMPLE KILLING SEND
GIVE TO KILLINGS HAVE BEEN VERY TARGETED AND WHY THEY'RE TARGETED SO THAT THEY'D MAKE INTERNATIONAL HEADLINES THE COUNTRY SIXTY MILLION PEOPLE WHEN YOU SEE THAT IN A GRIM ODD VILLAGE PRIEST HAS BEEN KILLED IT IS NOT VERY EASY TO DECCAN IF YOU WERE
HE WAS BASED WAS INTACT BUT A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN HIGH PROFILE PEOPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN THE PUBLIC EYE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN AFRAID TO TO CRITICISE EXTREMIST ISLAM AND IN SOME CASES THEY'VE BEEN HACKED TO DEATH IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR CAPITAL CITY YES TRUE AND WITH THE POLICE AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT I WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING AT IT THIS WAY WE KNOW WHO HAD THE PEOPLE BEHIND IT THE REALLY CRUCIAL THING IS THE BUNKER THIS IS THAT ACROSS STRAWS
INTO POLITICAL CROSSED SWORDS AND A DECISION OF THE COUNTRY WE MAKE INTO TOSA DATED ELECTIONS IS IT GOING TO BE A COUNTRY WHICH IS NOW A SECRETAIRE PROGRESS OF DEMOCRACY COUNTRY I WOULD BE A TALLY ONE COUNTRY SO
THE FORCES THAT ARE PUSHING THIS EXTREMISM ARE AT IT THEY ARE TRADED HIS TABLEAUX THE COUNTRY DO YOU STEP WITH THE GOVERNMENT

NINE MINUTES TONIGHT NOW CONTINUING WITH OUR SERIES HEARING VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO ASSESS HOW THE E.U. REFERENDUM RESULT MIGHT AFFECT THEM CENSURE BERG IS IN HULL THIS MORNING
YES GOOD MORNING YES GOOD MORNING
LOVE LETTERS ALONG THE ESTUARY YOU CAN PROBABLY HEAR
I'M STANDING IN FRONT HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS
THE GERMAN TECHNOLOGY GIANT SIEMENS
BUILDING A REALLY BIG FACTORY WHICH WILL BAKE TURBINE BLADE
WIND FARMS ACROSS EUROPE THEY HOPE
I'M JOINED BY FINBAR DOWNING WHO'S THE PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR SEEMED AT HOME YOU'RE QUITE WORRIED ABOUT HER VOTE TO LEAVE
SEAMAN'S POSITION THIS IS WE WANT TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. THERE'S TWO REASONS FOR THAT BUT IF I'D TAKEN IS SPECIFICALLY FOR SEMEN SOON WE'VE INVESTED FOUR HUNDRED MILLION EURO IN THIS FACILITY HERE IN HOLE IT'S AN ENORMOUS SITE ON THE BANKS OF THE HUMBER ESTUARY COVERING THE EQUIVALENT OF SEVENTY EIGHT FOOTBALL PITCHES THE REASON WERE CONCERNED IS THE SITE WHICH EMPLOYS THOUSAND PEOPLE MANUFACTURING BLADE
THE SITE'S CURRENTLY SIZED TO SERVE THE BRITISH MARKET OF THE NEXT ONE OR TWO YEARS
BEYOND THAT SIEMENS AS WE DO AND ALL HER BUSINESS WILL DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY AND WHAT THAT MEANS AS WILL BE GETTING MORE PRODUCTION WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF PEOPLE AND WHEN WE
PRODUCE MORE PRODUCT WE NEED TO HAVE A MARKET TO SELL THAT PRODUCT OR A CONCERNED ABOUT BODIES
KNOWING THE FACT OF WHETHER WE WILL HAVE A MARKET TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS INTO NEAR EUROPE IN THE COMING TWO THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW POLITICS WORKS YOU PRODUCE MORE OF THE SAME PEOPLE YOU DON'T NEED A MARKET SELLING INTO AND THAT'S WHERE WE CONCERNED
ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE IF WE DECIDE TO LEAVE THE E.U.
NOW FOR MANY YEARS HULL HAS BEEN AT THE BOTTLE WITH A FEW LIKE THE LEAGUE TABLE OF CITIES WHEN IT COMES TO SKILLED MANY PEOPLE HERE AND NOT VERY WELL PAID THEY'RE NOT VERY HIGHLY SKILLED
YOU HAVE BEEN BRINGING MORE SKILLED JOBS TO THE CITY BUT IF THE U.K. WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH IT BE AN IMPACT ON
I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OUTSIDE THE E.U. LOOKS LIKE AND THIS IS THE BIG GAMBLE IN THE BIG RISK WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO TAKE HER NO BUSINESS LIKES TO TAKE A RISK BECAUSE RISK UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING WE CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR WE NEED TO WORK IN FACT SOMEWHERE I CAN TELL YOU IS
SO HERE WE KNOW THE SIZE OF A MARKET CURRENTLY WE NOSE CAN BE LIKE NEXT YEAR IN THE YEAR AFTER WE ALSO KNOW THE PROTEIN YOU'RE GOING TO DRIVE SO WE KNOW TIC EMPLOYEE OR CONTINUE TO EMPLOY THE PEOPLE WE'RE GOING TO EMPLOY THE THOUSAND WE NEED TO HAVE MORE MARKETS IN TERMS OF SKILLS
IT SEEMS HE'S COME TO HAUL WE'VE HAD A FANTASTIC REACTION WE'VE HAD SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE APPLY FOR JOBS HAVE ASKED ME JOYLESS PEOPLE IN WORK
AND THE VAST PEOPLE HIGHLY QUALIFIED TO DO THE WORK WE'RE DOING SO WE'RE DELIGHTED WITH THE QUALITY OF PEOPLE HERE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE HERE BUT WE ARE CONCERNED THE BODIES WILL BE HAVE A MARKET BECAUSE WE WILL PRODUCE THE BEST PRODUCT
IN THE GLOBE AND WE PRODUCE A LOT OF THEM WILL WE HAVE THE MARKETS TO SELL THEM INTO WE'RE PRODUCING FOR THE SEVENTY FIVE METRES LONG THIS ISN'T A PRODUCT YOU CAN STICK IN A PLANE AND FLOATY NOTICED IT'S A CHINA IT NEEDS TO GO TO NEW EUROPE WHY CAN'T YOU JUST PUT IT ON A BOAT AND SEND IT TO AMERICA WHICH EITHER THESE BLADES ARE HUGELY FRAGILE OBJECTS THEY DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY FLY WITH THE WIND CLEARLY
THESE ARE NOT BELIEVES THAT WE WOULD WILLINGLY MOVE UNNECESSARILY SO WHEN WE TRANSPORT AND WE TRANSPORT HIM TO THE NORTH SEA AND MAYBE TWELVE TO TWENTY ARE STEAMING AND THAT'S ABOUT IT FINBAR DOWLING PROJECT DIRECTOR OF SEEMS IN HULL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SANCHA THANK YOU THE TIME IS NOW FIVE TO NINE
THEATRE MEETS VIDEO GAME END OF ARSES A PLAY IN WHICH THE AUDIENCE HELPS NOT JUST IN EFFECT TO WRITE THE PLOT BUT WISHING MOVE THE CHARACTERS AROUND THE STAGE ONE PERSON IS GIVEN CONTROL OF THE CHARACTER OF AN ASSASSIN SPEAKING TO THE ACTOR THROUGH A HEADSET THE REST OF THE AUDIENCE CONTROL THE REST OF THE CAST BY PRESSING BUTTONS ON THE KEYPAD IN A MOMENT WE'LL ASK WHY AND HOW IT WORKS BUT HERE'S A TASTER OF HOW IN REHEARSALS THE SINGLE PLAYER CONTROLLED HIS CHARACTER MEA CULPA THE ASSASSIN
MAYBE CHECK ON THE DESK WAS IN THE DESK VERY USEFUL WITH A LAPTOP A SCREEN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE WHO'S THAT THAT'S THE TARGET IT'S GOT TO GO YOUR WAY
NIAMH LET'S GET YOU GOING OUT YEAH SERIOUSLY CUTE NO O.K. WHAT DO YOU DO WE HAVE TO GET GOING YOU'VE GOT TO BE TO BE HIS MENTOR AND JUDGE US DIRTIES JUST RUN JUST GET OUT GET OUT JUST RUN AWAY
THAT WE HAVE HAS MELODY CROSSING BACK OR WHO'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO CO CREATOR AN ACTOR SHE PLAYS THE CHARACTER MAKE UP OF THESE AS IN DAN THOMPSON IS HERE ANOTHER CO CREATOR AND ANOTHER ACTOR PLAY SAM THE SECURITY GUARD BEFORE YOU EXPLAIN HOW IT WAS WHAT A LITTLE FEEL OF IT
WHY MELANIE WELL PLUS IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THIS CROSS SECTION BETWEEN SORT OF THEATRE AND THE GAMING COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES THEN IN LOTS OF WAYS VERY VERY SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER THEY DON'T OFTEN SPEAK TO EACH OTHER AND WE WITH AN INTEREST IN BOTH THEATRE AND VIDEO GAMES IT BECOMES REALLY APPARENT THESE TWO FORMS ARE COMPLETELY COMPARABLE COS YOU'LL THINK THAT IS THE AUDIENCE ARE IN THE THEATRE BUT YOU'RE NOT MEAN YOU'RE NOT WITH THAT MA YOU'RE A DISCREET YES YES THAT'S RIGHT SO WE SO WE WERE ACTUALLY PERFORMING IT FROM A SEPARATE LOCATION LIVE STREAMING IT THROUGH INTERNET CONNECTION
SO MELANIE YOU GET THESE INSTRUCTS YOU'RE WEARING A HEADSET TO PRODUCING CAN HIT THIS NOW WHEN YOU GET AN INSTRUCTION HAVE YOU GOT IN YOUR MIND A SERIES OF PRE SET MOVES AND PRESET LINES WHICH WHAT YOU'RE TOLD TRIGGERS OR ARE YOU IMPROVISE ACCORDING TO WHAT SAID THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH ACTUALLY SO WE HAVE A STRUCTURE FOR THE GAME WE HAVE OF A SCRIPT
THE SCRIPT BECAUSE IT WEARS A DIALOGUE YOU CAN'T FREE AREN'T WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY TO YOU YOU CAN'T PRINT WHAT YOU GOING TO SAY IN REPLY THERE WAS A STRUCTURE TO THE SHOW WHICH WE FOLLOW AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN THERE'S ONE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF POSSIBLE ROUTES IN THE GAMES THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME WE DO THE GAME IS COMPLETELY UNIQUE
BUT YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR MIND SOME PATHWAYS HAVE YOU SOME YES IS DEFINITELY A FORM IF THERE WAS A STRUCTURE THAT YES NOW THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING THE ASSASSIN FOR THOSE ARE THE SCOURGE OF GOD FOR EXAMPLE HOW CAN THE AUDIENCE YOU CAN'T TALK TO YOU CAN JUST PRESS A BUTTON TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS YES THEY DO SO SO THE AUDIENCE DON'T TALK TO ME BUT WE DO HAVE ONE OF OUR OWN CHARACTERS THAT IS IN THE SAME SPACE AS THE AUDIENCE SO HE'S TALKING TO THE AUDIENCE
HE'S RECEIVING THEIR VOTES ASKING THEM TO MAKE DECISION HOW DO YOU GET YOUR INSTRUCTIONS SO THAT CHARACTER IS THEN RELAYING THOSE INSTRUCTIONS TO MY CHARACTER SO I PLAY SECURITY GUARD SUMP ASSETS AND HE'S THERE INITIALLY AT LEAST TO PREVENT THE ASSASSINATION FROM FROM HAPPENING SO THE AUDIENCE MAKE VOTES ON ON WEATHER AND WHAT MY CHARACTER SHOULD DO YOU AND WHETHER TO HELP OR HINDER AN EXAMPLE WHAT SORT OF VOTE MIGHT THEY BE OFFERED A CABLE IN IN THE EARLY STAGES THEY WILL BE KIND OF
MORE KIND OF LIKE DECISIONS FOR EXAMPLE SHOOT HE DRESS UP IN PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY UNIFORM I GO UNDERCOVER OR NOT LATER ON THE DECISIONS MIGHT GET A BIT DARKER ALONG THE LINES OF SHOULD YOU LET THIS CHARACTER LIVE OR NOT AND IF THERE A SET CONCLUSION MELANIE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE AUDIENCE WHAT DO YOU ALL OF YOU IN THE CAR STORY THIS ATTIC WILL WIN SOMEBODY WILL GET KILLED
NOT REALLY HERE KNOWING THERE A SET ENDINGS IS ABOUT I THINK AT LEAST THIRTY SIX POSSIBLE ENDINGS AND ITS MOST IT FLUTTERS WITH OBJECTIVES SO WHO'S GOING TO WIN AND HE'S GOING TO LOSE SO YOU GOING TO DIE OR SHE'S GOING TO SURVIVE SHE MAY OR MAY NOT ACHIEVE HER OBJECTIVE TO ASSASSINATE TARGET AND ONE THING THAT FASCINATES ME ARE YOU GETTING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THEATRE AUDIENCE FROM THE ONE YOU WOULD GET BY AGE BY PROFILE
YEAH THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION WE GET QUITE A BROAD DEMOGRAPHIC AT THE MOMENT IS NOT JUST VIDEO GAMES NO NOT AT ALL DO YOU GET SOME OF THOSE ANY CAUSE OPENED YOU KIDS ARE YOUNG VIDEO GAME AS YOU WOULD NEVER LEAVE THEIR BEDROOM NEVER MIND STEP FOOT IN A THEATRE OF
TRUE IT'S UM IT'S THE AUDIENCE BIT YOU'RE GOING TO NOT WHATEVER EXPECTS IT TO BE THAT MUCH MORE DIVERSE THERE'S A LOT OF WOMEN GAMERS AND A LOT OF MIDDLE AGED GAME IS ACTUALLY ONLY ONE I KNOW AUDIENCES VERY VARIED TO REPRESENT THAT AS WELL YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT ME PLAYING VIDEOGAMES MY KIDS DO BUT I'M SO DREADFUL LIKE ONCE A YEAR DAD PLAY FEVER THERE'S LIKE THAT
