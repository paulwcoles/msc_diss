IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE TWENTY THIRD OF APRIL GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING CAMPAIGNERS FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAVE BEEN ATTACKING BARACK OBAMA FOLLOWING HIS COMMENTS ON EUROPE YESTERDAY A MINISTER HAS DESCRIBED THE PRESIDENT AS A LAME DUCK DOING DAVID CAMERON A POLITICAL FAVOUR
N.H.S. ENGLAND SAYS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OPERATIONS WILL BE POSTPONED AS A RESULT OF THE ESCALATION IN INDUSTRIAL ACTION BY JUNIOR DOCTORS AND LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THE RACE TO BECOME THE NEXT LONDON MAYOR IS MIRED IN ACCUSATIONS AND COUNTER ACCUSATIONS OF RACISM AND SUPPORT FOR EXTREMISM IN THE PRIME MINISTER HAS HAD HIS SAY THEY ARE SHOUTING DOWN AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR
I'LL BE SPEAKING TO THE LABOUR CANDIDATE SO HE CAN'T HAVE JUST SHORTLY AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK WILL ALSO GET THE LATEST ON THE HUNT TO FIND THE KILLER OR KILLERS AND EIGHT PEOPLE
FROM THE SAME FAMILY SHOT DEAD IN A HIGHER AND THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME SOME OF THEATRES BEST KNOWN STARS SHARE THEIR LOVE FOR SHAKESPEARE WILL HEAR FROM DAVID TENNANT FROM GREGORY DORAN THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE COMPANY AND FROM SIR IN THE CAP
HE KEEPS COMING BACK AND BACK TO THE IDEA THAT IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOU WERE BEINGS HIM HIMSELF ABROAD
THAT'S THE VOICE OF AN ACTOR SPEAKING OUT I THINK SHAKESPEARE MUST HAVE BEEN AN ACTRESS
TODAY'S NEWSREADERS CORACLE PHIL PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL EMBARK ON THE SECOND FULL DAY HOOP IT'S VISIT TO BRITAIN THIS MORNING WITH THAT ROW OVER HIS INTERVENTION IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN SHOWING NO SIGN OF A BEIJING HE'S DUE TO MEET THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN AND TO VISIT THE GLOBE THEATRE IN LONDON AS PART OF THE CELEBRATIONS MARKING THE FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF SHAKESPEARE'S DEATH BUT THE VISIT HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY HIS DIRECT AND PASSIONATE APPEAL IN FAVOURITE BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
IN PARTICULAR HIS MORNING PUT THE U.K. COULD NOT EXPECT TO SEPARATE TRADE DEAL WITH THE U.S. ANY TIME SOON IF IT VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAS INCENSED THOSE CAMPAIGNING FOR A BRITISH EXIT HE'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN
AS BARACK OBAMA'S VISIT TO BRITAIN DRAWS TO A CLOSE HIS UNEXPECTEDLY FORTHRIGHT INTERVENTION IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WILL BE CELEBRATED BY THE REMAIN SIDE BUT THE PRESIDENT LEAVES A STORM OF CONTROVERSY BEHIND HIM TO LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAVE RUBBISHED HIS STATEMENT THAT BRITAIN OUTSIDE THE Y. YOU WOULD BE AT THE BACK OF THE QUEUE FOR A TRADE DEAL WITH THE U.S. THE JUSTICE MINISTER DOMINIC ROB SAID IT CAME FROM A LAME DUCK U. S. PRESIDENT ABOUT TO MOVE OFF THE STAGE DOING AN OLD BRITISH FRIEND OR POLITICAL FAVOUR
THE USE OF THE PHRASE BACK OF THE QUEUE RATHER THAN THE AMERICAN VERNACULAR BACK OF THE LINE WAS SEIZED UPON BY VOTE LEAVE WHO SAID IT WAS OBVIOUS MISTER OBAMA'S WORDS WERE WRITTEN IN NUMBER TEN DOWNING STREET NOT THE WHITE HOUSE IT'S UNDERSTOOD THERE WAS SOME UNEASE THAT ITS USE AMONG WHITE HOUSE STAFF HOWEVER A DOWNING STREET SOURCE DISMISS THE CRITICISM SAYING THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF
N.H.S. ENGLAND HAS HER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE LATER STRIKE ACTION BEING TAKEN BY JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THEIR DISPUTE ABOUT A NEW CONTRACT THEY'RE DUE TO WITHDRAW THEIR LABOUR NEXT TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY IN THE FIRST FULL WALK OUT IN THE HISTORY OF THE N.H.S. WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THOSE WORKING IN EMERGENCY CARE PATIENTS ARE BEING TOLD TO EXPECT DELAYS DURING HER TIME AT WHAT N.H.S. ENGLAND CALLS HEIGHTENED RISK OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT SOAPY HUTCHINSON REPORTS
HOSPITAL BOSSES IN ENGLAND SAY ALL N.H.S. TRUSTS ARE NOW READY TO FACE THIS HISTORIC WALKOUT BY JUNIOR DOCTORS THEY SAY PLANS ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SERVICES SUCH AS EMERGENCY CARE MATERNITY AND RESUSCITATION NEVERTHELESS THE N.H.S. IS WARNING OVER THE TWO DAYS OF STRIKES THERE WILL BE AN IMPACT ALMOST ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN POSTPONED AND ALMOST THIRTEEN THOUSAND ELECTIVE OPERATIONS
THAT'S MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY OPERATIONS AS FOR PREVIOUS STRIKES BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER A TWO WEEK PERIOD SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE SAID A LONGER PLANNING PROCESS HAD BEEN NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF THIS INDUSTRIAL ACTION THE DOCTORS' UNION THE B.M.A. HAS SAID IT REGRETS THE DISRUPTION
THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL IS TRAVELLING TO TURKEY TO PROMOTE A DEAL REACH LAST MONTH TO MANAGE THE MIGRANT CRISIS TOGETHER WITH THE E.U. PRESIDENT DONALD TO HAVE SCANNED BY IS PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FRANZ TIMMERMAN SUGAR PSITTACOSIS CAN TAP A TOWN ON THE BORDER WITH SYRIA THREE BUT ALSO TALKS OF THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER I MET DOUBLE TO DO SELLING GEAR IT'S REPORTS FROM GARCIA AND TAP
ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS REACHING GREASE FROM TURKEY HAS DROPPED BY AROUND EIGHTY PERCENT FEWER YOUR EXPERTS HAVE ARRIVED IN THE FIELD AND MANY E.U. NATIONS DRAGGING THEIR FUSE TO EXCEPT MORE MIGRANTS IN
THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL SAID THE AIM OF THEIR VISIT IS TO SEE THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF THE MIGRANTS IN TURKEY THE COUNTRY ALREADY HORST'S MORE THAN TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION SYRIAN MIGRANTS AT A COST OF OVER SEVEN BILLION POUNDS ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT FIGURES THE YEW HAS PLEDGED UP TO FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION POUNDS IN AID TO TURKEY OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS BUT ALCA EXPECTS MORE STEPS LIKE THESE ARE FREE TRAVEL FOR ITS CITIZENS WILLING TO GO TO EUROPE
THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES AS TURKEY'S PRIME MINISTER UM IT'S DEVIL DOLL HAS WARNED THAT THE WHOLE DEAL COULD COLLAPSE IF THE E.U. FAILS TO MEET MEN
POLICE IN THE UNITED STATES SAY AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN RURAL OHIO HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS EXECUTION STYLE KILLINGS THE VICTIMS WERE FOUND IN FOUR PLACES NEAR EACH OTHER A HUGE HUNT IS UNDERWAY FOR THE KILLER LAURA REPLICA REPORTS
IT'S BELIEVED THE VICTIMS SEVEN ADULTS AND A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BOY ARE FROM THE SAME FAMILY THEY WERE FOUND AT FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ALONG THE SAME ROAD THEY WERE ALL SHOT IN THE HEAD
THREE YOUNG CHILDREN SURVIVED THE SHOOTING ONE WAS A FOUR DAY OLD CHILD WHO WAS FOUND IN BED NEXT TO HER MOTHER POLICE BELIEVE THE KILLINGS WERE TARGETED AND THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR A MORTARS AND A SUSPECT THEY SAY THERE'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS ARMED AND INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS AND THEY'VE WARNED OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SAME FAMILY TO BE VIGILANT
ANALYSIS OF JIHADI GROUPS HAS CONCLUDED THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A TYPICAL JIHADIST AND THAT TOO LITTLE IS BEING DONE TO SMASH THE NETWORKS THEY FORM ON THE ROUTE TO TERRACE AND BALANCE THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT BY THE CENTRE ON RELIGION AND GEO POLITICS PART OF THEIR FAITH THINK TANK SET UP BY TONY BLAIR DOMINIC CASH REPORTS
IT'S NOW A CYST LOOKS AT THE LIFE STORY OF ONE HUNDRED LEADING JIHADISTS FIGURES CHELSEA HOW THEY ROSE TO THE TOP HOW THEY'VE SUSTAINED THEIR POSITIONS AND THE TYPES OF ORGANISATIONS THEY'VE DEVELOPED TO NURTURE THE NEXT GENERATION BEHIND THEM
WHILE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS FOCUSED ON MILITARILY DEFEATING THE AUTHOR'S ARGUED TOO LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE TO CHALLENGE THE NETWORKS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OVER DECADES TO ENCOURAGE RECRUITS IN THEIR PERSONAL JOURNEY TOWARDS EXTREMISM ALMOST ALL OF THE CURRENT JIHADI LEADERSHIP HAVE SOME KIND OF LINK BACK TO AFGHANISTAN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE AUTHOR'S WORN SYRIA IS ITS MODERN DAY EQUIVALENT
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS FROM OUTSIDE EUROPE ARE HAVING THEIR VISAS CURTAILED BY THE HOME OFFICE ACCORDING TO DATA OBTAINED BY B.B.C. NEWS THE HOME OFFICE FIGURES SHOW ITS CRACKDOWN ON IMMIGRATION ABUSES WORKING BUT CRITICS SAY STUDENTS ARE BEING SCAPEGOATED HE'S ART EDUCATION REPORTER JUDITH BURNS
THE FIGURES RELEASED UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION RULES SHOW ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS A YEAR HAD THEIR VISAS CURTAILED BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN IN THE SAME PERIOD MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAD THEIR LICENCES TO SPONSOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS REVOKED THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS UNABLE TO GIVE ANY MORE DETAILS BUT SAID THEY WERE POOR QUALITY INSTITUTIONS WHICH WERE DAMAGING THE U.K.'S REPUTATION FOR TOP QUALITY EDUCATION
DOMINIC SCOTT OF THE U.K. COUNCIL FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENT AFFAIRS SAID HE FEARED THE HOME OFFICE MIGHT BE TRYING TO MEET NET MIGRATION TARGETS RATHER THAN ADDRESSING REAL ABUSE THE NATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS SAID THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTIONS WOULD FURTHER DAMAGE THE U.K.'S REPUTATION AS A DESIRABLE PLACE TO STUDY
EVENTS ARE BEING HELD ACROSS THE U.K. AND BEYOND TO MARK THE DEATH BUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE MAN WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE THE WORLD'S GREATEST PLAYWRIGHT WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE THE BARD IT'S BELIEVED TO HAVE DIED ON THIS STATE HIS FIFTY SECOND BIRTHDAY IN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN AND FOR THE PAST YEAR ACTORS WRITERS AND SABINE CELEBRATING HIS LIFE AND WORK THE COMMEMORATIONS WILL CENTRE ON STRATFORD UPON AVON IN WARWICKSHIRE WHERE HE WAS BORN AND WHERE HE WAS LAID TO REST OUR ARTS CORRESPONDENTS LISSOM MY SIMILAR REPORTS
FOR CENTURIES AFTER SHAKESPEARE'S DEATH THE THEMES HE EXPLORED IN HIS WRITING ARE AS RELEVANT TO MODERN AUDIENCES AS THEY WERE TO THEATREGOERS FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO
IN LONDON THE DAY WILL BE MARKED WITH PERFORMANCES OF HAMLET AT THE GLOBE THEATRE BY A TOURING PRODUCTION THAT'S VISITED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY COUNTRIES DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS
IN THE PLAYWRIGHTS BIRTHPLACE OF STRATFORD UPON AVON THERE'LL BE A PARADE THROUGH THE TOWN CENTRE BY LOCAL DIGNITARIES AND CHARACTERS IN SHAKESPEARE IN COSTUME
THE PRINCE OF WALES WILL BE AT THE CHURCH WHICH HOUSE IS SHAKESPEARE'S GRAVE AND DURING THE EVENING WILL BE PERFORMANCES OF SOME OF THE PLAYWRIGHT'S BEST KNOWN SCENES AT THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE THEATRE BY A CAST WHICH WILL INCLUDE BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AND DAME JUDI DENCH
THESE ARE REPORTING THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT WAS OBVIOUS WASN'T IT FROM THE MOMENT THAT HIS DAILY TELEGRAPH ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED YESTERDAY THAT BARACK OBAMA WAS ON THE OFFENSIVE HIS INTERVENTION IN OUR E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE WAS NOT GOING TO BE SUBTLE IAN WATSON'S UP LITTLE CORRESPONDENT KABOOM IAN HAD QUITE AN IMPACT AS THEIR IMPACT LECTURE SMACK AROUND THE HEAD OR A PUNCH TO THE FACE OR JUST IN THE QUESTION IS WILL THERE BE ANY LONG LASTING DAMAGE TO THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE ATTITUDE YOU'VE BEEN A NORTH AMERICAN EDITOR
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY SAID IN HIS HEAD IN THE TELEGRAPH BRITAIN'S INFLUENCE WOULD BE MY DEFIED IF IT STAYED IN THE E. URI SAID JOBS DRAW ALMOST AT THAT ALL THESE THINGS THAT FANTASTIC BY SAYING HOWEVER THAT BRITAIN WOULD GO TO THE BACK OF THE QUEUE FOR A TRADE DEAL HE REALLY UPPED THE ANTE PEOPLE DIDN'T QUITE EXPECT THAT JAWS DROPPED I THINK
AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND OF COURSE SPECULATION AT BECAUSE HE USED THAT PHRASE BACK OF THE QUEUE NOT THE AMERICAN BACK OF THE LINE WAS ALONE EFFECTIVELY FED TO HIM BY DOWNING STREET CERTAINLY IT'S INTERCOURSE WAIT POSTSCRIPT BUT DOWNING STREET SAY NO HE WAS SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF WHAT HE WAS DOING I SUPPOSE QUITE BLUNTLY WAS TAKING ON HER HEAD ON ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT THE BRAKES ARE TEARS MAKE WHICH IS SIMPLY THIS THAT
IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. WE CAN HAVE ALL THESE NEW TRADING RELATIONSHIPS WERE COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF EUROPE HE WAS SAYING IF YOU WANT TO GET ACCESS TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST MARKETS WILL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE PRIORITIES THAT WAS A VERY BLUNT MESSAGE I THINK YOU MEAN CAMPAIGN BELIEVE NO THAT THAT THAT THAT THINGS ARE BEGINNING TO MOVE THEIR WAY AFTER THE PAST WEEK AND VERY VERY TIGHT THEY ASKED IT TO TEASE YOU FREEZE MAKING AN IMPACT FOR THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN THEY'VE THEY'VE GOT TO ANSWER THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS THAT ARE RAISED BY A BOMBER
YES THEY DO THE INITIAL INITIAL REACTION OF COURSE WAS A CHEF IF I CHUCK IN A FUSILLADE OF MY WOULD ABUSE BUT EFFECTIVELY SAYING THAT HE'S A LAME DUCK PRESIDENT HE WON'T BE THERE BY THE TIME WE HAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION OF PEOPLE VOTE TO DO SO JOHN THEY'VE GOT TO THAT HAVEN'T THEY YES THEY DO THAT THIS AGAIN PUTS PRESSURE ON THIS IS PART OF THE OVERALL CAMPAIGN THE CAMPAIGN IT WAS A BIT LIKE THIS AS DAVID CAMERON SAID
COUNTRIES THAT WISH AS WELL I'M NOT ASKING US TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION OTHERS IN THE MAIN CAMPAIGNER SAYING WHAT OTHER MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BODY IS ASKING FOR US TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE COURT I'M F. AND SO ON THE PINNACLE OF THIS WAS HAVING THE BERWICK AND PRESIDENT HIMSELF RAISING VERY SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT LEAVING EUROPEAN UNION SO THAT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SAY WHAT WE WOULD LOOK LIKE WHAT KIND OF TRADE DEALS WITH THE NEGOTIATE SO QUICK WE CAN NEGOTIATE THEM WHAT WOULD BE THE ALTERNATIVE
TO STAYING IN TODAY THOUGH IT IS INTERESTING THAT IF YOU WANT A FAR MORE FAMILIAR TERRITORY DUNCAN SMITH FOR EXAMPLE IN HIS OWN OR PAIRED PERHAPS NOT THE SPECTACULARS OBAMA'S BUT POINTING OUT THAT THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WORKED AS A MAGNET FOR PEOPLE COMING TO BRITAIN THERE'LL BE A STAMPEDE TO AS HE'S SAYING SO I THINK AGAIN THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE BACK ONTO THIS QUESTION OF THE BALANCE OF RISK IS A RISK
TO STAY IN THERE TO PULL OUT SO THAT'S THE RESPONSE BUT IT'S NOT A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE TRADE THE MADRID QUESTION AND THEY CAN ALSO QUITE LEGITIMATELY CAN'T THEY SAY WELL HANG ON A SECOND BARACK OBAMA ISN'T GOING TO BE AROUND WHEN THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE DONE AND IT'S PERFECTLY FEASIBLE TO SAY ACTUALLY THAT THAT BACK OF THE QUEUE LINE IS JUST NOT TRUE THAT'S RIGHT AT THE MOMENT WE DON'T HAVE A TRADE DEAL WITH AMERICANS ACTUALLY GOT ROUGHLY THE OUTRIGGERS IMBALANCE WITH WITH AMERICAN ANYTHING TO BE IN THE INTERESTS OF BOTH COUNTRIES TO CONDUCT A TRADE DEAL
BUT THE IDEA OF A FREE TRADE ZONE IF YOU LIKE BETWEEN UNITED KINGDOM UNITED STATES THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT IT DOESN'T STOP TRADE GOING ON WITHOUT IT THAT'S QUITE DIFFERENT FROM BEEN ABLE TO SAY THAT I SHOULD BE EASY TO TO TO INSTIGATE THESE NEW RELATIONSHIPS BUT AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE ABLE TO SAY THAT THERE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT AND CHARGE AND CERTAINLY THIS MORNING IT'S AN ADVISER TO THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS GEORGE BUSH WAS A MUCH MORE RELAXED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF BREAKS
AND CERTAINLY THE OTHER HOPE THAT THEY WEAVE CAMPAIGN HALVE IT ISN'T THIS WHOLE THING IS TOO HEAVY HANDED IT BACKFIRES CERTAINLY ONE POLL SUGGESTED THAT MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC FELT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE FOR OBAMA TO INTERVENE BLOOD DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO SAY THAT NOT LISTENING TO HIS WARNINGS IN WATSON THANKS
FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOREIGN STUDENTS HAVE HAD THEIR VISAS CURTAILED BY THE HOME OFFICE AND BEING SENT BACK TO THEIR COUNTRIES OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AND HUNDREDS OF COLLEGES HAVE BEEN CLOSED DOWN THAT ACCORDING TO THE LATEST FIGURES WELL I'M JOINED BY JULIE ALLEN FROM THE U.K. COUNCIL FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENT AFFAIRS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS THAT A LOT DO YOU THINK
WELL IT DOES SOUND A LOT DOESN'T IT SOUNDS QUITE DRAMATIC BUT I THINK THE FIRST THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT COULD TELL WHENCE DON'T NECESSARILY EQUATES TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS BEING KICKED OUT OF THE U.K. BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG RIGHT OR SO WITHIN THOSE NUMBERS THE HOME OFFICE WILL HAVE RECORDED ANY STUDENTS HERE WERE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.K. BUT ACTUALLY FOR ANY REASON DECIDED NOT TO COME SO THERE'S NUMBERS ALSO INCLUDE NO SHOWS FOR A NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO NEVER CAME TO THE U.K.
AND EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HAVE GOT VERY STRICT REQUIREMENTS AND HAVE TO SEND SEVERAL REPORTS TO THE HOME OFFICE OF ACTIVITIES BY THE STUDENTS SO THOSE REPORTS WERE ALSO INCLUDES STUDENTS WHO'VE WITHDRAW VOLUNTARILY FOR VARIOUS DIFFERENT REASONS STUDENTS WHO DIDN'T PROGRESS AND MAYBE HAVE TO LEAVE THE U.K. AND COME BACK LATER FOR A RESET SO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT FIGURE MIGHT BE THEN IF YOU TAKE ALL THOSE OUT
AT THE MOMENT IT SEEMS TO BE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND VIEWER BUT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT IT'S NOT AS HIGH AS THAT BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THE HOME OFFICE DON'T SEPARATE THOSE FIGURES ARE RIGHT BUT YOU WOULDN'T DENY WOULD YOU THAT THERE ARE COLLEGES BOGUS COLLEGES THAT NEED TO BE CLOSED DOWN BECAUSE WELL FRANKLY THEY'RE TELLING LIES
I THINK THIS IS THE TIME BOGGIS COLLEGES IT DOESN'T REALLY APPLY THESE DAYS I THINK IN THE PAST CERTAINLY IN THE PAST I THINK CERTAINLY THERE WAS ABUSE IN THE SYSTEM AND YOU KISS WITH YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS DON'T WANT TO HAVE ABUSE WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND THEY BUT YOU'D HAVE YOU SEEN THAT PANORAMA PROGRAMME THAT EXPOSED
IT'S PRETTY NASTY BUT BAD GOINGS ON YEAH AND THAT'S THAT'S BEEN SCRUTINISED AS WELL ABOUT THERE'S SOME OF THE DATA THAT CAME OUT OF THAT
BUT I THINK NOWADAYS THAT THE SYSTEM THERE'S NO IN PLACE THERE I REALLY STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR SPONSORS ALL OF THOSE RECENT COLLEGES THAT HAVE HAD THEIR COLLEGES ARE INSTITUTIONS THEY'VE HAD THEIR LICENCE IF WE VOTE THEY WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH IS STRICT
ASSESSMENTS THEY ALL HAVE BEEN QUALITY ASSURED BY VARIOUS NATIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND THEY WILL HAVE BEEN INSPECTED BY THE HOME OFFICE THEMSELVES SO AT SOME POINT THE HOME OFFICE SAID THAT THOSE COLLEGES WHERE THEY MET AND HAD SYSTEMS IN PLACE IN ORDER TO HOST AND TEACH INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS SON LATER THEY THEN WE BOUGHT THOSE LICENCES A BUT DO YOU THINK THERE ARE STILL CROOKS OUT THERE WHO ARE TAKING MONEY IN RETURN FOR MAKING BOGUS CLAIMS ABOUT THE STUDENTS ALLEGED STUDENTS
THERE MAY WELL BE BUT I THINK THE NUMBERS ARE VERY SMALL AND I CONCERN IS IS IT
WHAT HAPPENS TO STUDENTS IN THAT SYSTEM SO FOR THOSE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS THAT DO EQUATE TO GIN'S BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE COUNTRY IF THE INSTITUTIONS DO HAVE SOME FEELINGS IF THEY'RE NOT MEETING THEIR REQUIREMENTS IF THEY'VE NOT GOT QUALITY TEACHING IT'S THE STUDENTS HERE ARE
THAT IS THE STUDENTS WHO SUFFER BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WILL BE STUDENT STUDENTS I'D PUT THE WOOD IN INVERTED COMMAS COS THEY'RE NOT REALLY SOON AS THEY WILL BE PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME TO THIS COUNTRY CLAIMING TO BE STUDENTS WHEN THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF STUDYING WE KNOW THAT DON'T WE FROM CERTAIN SOME CASE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN
WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPOSED I THINK WITH THE NASAL SYSTEM YOU GOING TO GET SOME PEOPLE HERE PLAYING THAT SYSTEM BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF STUDENTS WHO COME TO THE U.K. THERE IT'S QUITE A COMPLICATED SYSTEM FOR STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR A STUDENT VISA THESE DAYS IS IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT GOING TO REZA'S THERE ARE LOTS OF REQUIREMENTS THERE LOTS OF DOCUMENTATION IT'S QUITE A COSTLY BUSINESS AND STUDENTS HAVE GOT TO TAKE EXAMS IT'S
IT'S NOT AN EASY IT'S NOT AN EASY SYSTEM TO NAVIGATE FOR A STUDENT OR FOR THE INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES OR SOME OF THOSE REVOLT COLLEGE THIS STUDENTS THAT INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE HAD THEIR LICENCE EVERY VOTE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TRIPPED UP JUST BY MANY OF THE TECHNICALITIES AND WITHIN THE REQUIREMENTS OF BEING A SPONSOR THE OTHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN SHOULD COUNCIL TAX BANDS BE REORGANISED SO THEY REFLECT THE REAL GIGANTIC VALUE OF SOME HOUSES AND GET THEIR OWNERS TO PAY A MORE REALISTIC WHACK THE SUGGESTION CAME UP PARLIAMENT YESTERDAY THIS MARK DARCY REPORTS
THOSE WHOM THE GODS WOULD DESTROY THEY FIRST PERSUADE TO REFORM LOCAL TAXES EVER SINCE THE POLL TAX SPOT FURY OF SCOTLAND BUT RIOTS IN LONDON BUT CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEMISE OF MARGARET THATCHER LOCAL TAXATION HAS BEEN A DANGER ZONE FOR ANY GOVERNMENT BUT IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS YESTERDAY THE CONSERVATIVE PEER LORD MOLES FOOT RUSHED IN WHERE MINISTERS FEAR TO TREAD AND FLOATED A PLAN TO CREATE NEW VALUATION BANDS FOR THE COUNCIL TAX IS EXISTING SISTINE
LITERALLY OUT OF DATE IT IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT I KNOW IT'S ONLY GOT
TO REALISE THE PUBLIC COMPLAINTS HAD TO BE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE HOLE IS DRILLING AND THE MOST EXPENSIVE LUXURIOUS PENTHOUSE IN LONDON
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COUNCIL TAXPAYERS AND EACH GAZE IS ONLY THREE TO ONE HE WANTED A ROLLING REVALUATION OF PROPERTIES UNDER WHICH THEY'D BE ASSIGNED A NEW COUNCIL TAX BAND BASED ON THEIR MOST RECENT SALES PRICE IF THEY'RE CHANGED HANDS SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT IS HIGH TIME IF WE DO USE SOME NEW THINKING
AND WE DO PRODUCE SOMETHING WHICH IS MORE ACCEPTABLE A MOST SEEM TO BE
BUT IT CAME UNDER FIRE FROM ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE LORD TRUE WHO LEADS RICHMOND COUNCIL IN SOUTH WEST LONDON HE ARGUED THAT BECAUSE HOUSE PRICES WERE ROCKETING LORD MILES FOOT'S PLAN WOULD MEAN TWO PARALLEL SETS OF VALUATIONS ONE BASED ON A RECENT SALE PRICE ONE BASED ON MORE HISTORIC VALUES THAT WOULD BE UNFAIR PEOPLE LIVING NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER
WOULD PAY WILDLY DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNTS OF COUNCIL TAX POTENTIALLY WILDLY DISPROPORTIONATE AT THE UPPER END SURFER HIS REGISTER I DON'T THINK THAT AT A JUSTIFIABLE OR SENSIBLE WAY TO GO FORWARD
IT WAS A RESERVATION SHARED BY ANOTHER FORMER COUNCIL LEADER LABOUR'S MACKENZIE OF LUTON WAS THE NOBLE RAW ADDRESS WITH THAT AT THE VERY TELLING POINT AN OVERALL TREE LADIES YOU'RE GOING TO END UP
WE'VE TWO SCHEDULES OF VALUATION PROPERTIES NEXT TO EACH OTHER OTHERWISE IDENTI
UNDER THE NOBLE LORD SYSTEM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COUNCIL TAX THAT CANNOT BE SENT
LORD MACKAY WHO'D SERVED AS LORD CHANCELLOR IN THE THATCHER GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME OF THE POLL TAX AGREED THAT SOME KIND OF CHANGE WAS NEEDED BUT HE UNDERLINED THE DANGEROUS OUR BEER
THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHOULD CONSIDER LEWIS EXTREMELY CAREFULLY ANNOYING OF COURSE THE POLITICAL RISKS AND STUDENT AND DO YOU NOTHING I THOUGHT IN THIS AREA BUT COURAGE IS REQUIRED IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE FIT
AND ANOTHER VETERAN OF THAT ERA LORD CORMAC WAS EVEN MORE CAUTIOUS I'M REMINDED OF
DORA'S BOXES IN THERE HENRY TRUE
I REALLY DO FEEL WE HAVE TO TREAD CAREFULLY HERE AS ONE OF ONLY TWO CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO DO NOT SUPPORT THE INTRODUCTION OF THE POLL TAX AND SCOTT
AND HAVE CONSISTENTLY VOTED AGAINST IT ON EVERY CONCEIVABLE IMPOSSIBLE OCCASION I
HOPE WE BUT WE WILL TREAD EXTREMELY
BUT HE THOUGHT ONE PARTICULAR SET OF HOMEOWNERS DID DESERVE TO FACE EXTRA TAX I DO BELIEVE THAT THE ESCALATION OF PROPERTY PRICES IN LONDON BUT
HAS CAUSED ENORMOUS REPERCUSSIONS FOR THE NATIVE POPULAR
UNDER SOME FORM OF SURCHARGE ON THOSE WHO MERELY
AS INVESTMENTS AND RARELY IF ANY EVER
HAS TO BE SOME CONSIDERATION OF HOW WE DID
FOR THE GOVERNMENT LORD YOUNGER OF LECCY SAID THERE WAS NO APPETITE TO TAMPER WITH THE LOCAL TAX SYSTEM COUNCIL TAX IN ENGLAND HAS FALLEN BY NINE PERCENT IN REAL TERMS SINCE TWENTY TEN TO ELEVEN
THE GOVERNMENT SEES NO NEED TO INTRODUCE TURBULENCE AND UNCERTAINTY INTO HOUSEHOLDS FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT BY CHANGING THE COUNCIL TAX BANDS WITH THE END OF THE PARLIAMENTARY YEAR LOOMING LORD MASTERED HAS NO CHANCE OF GETTING HIS BILL INTO LAW BUT HE HAS FLOATED AN INTERESTING TRIAL BALLOON DARCY REPORTING MORE
ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST BEFORE TEN TO NINE ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAY BUT I HAVE A AS GOING TO THE THEATRE TODAY IN LONDON THE GLOBE THEATRE SO BAD TIMING THE FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF SHAKESPEARE'S DEATH FOR THE LAST YEAR ACTORS WRITERS AND ENTHUSIASTS HAVE BEEN CELEBRATING HIS WORK SIR IAN MCKELLEN HAS COME UP WITH HIS OWN WAY TO HONOUR HIM HE'S LAUNCHED A SERIES OF ACTS THAT WILL ALLOW THE USERS TO LISTEN TO WELL KNOWN ACTORS READING THE PLAYS IN THE FIRST SO IAN HIMSELF PLAYS THE PART OF PROSPERO IN THE TEMPEST ZOE CONWAY'S BEEN TALKING TO HIM
I WAS TO CLICK ON THIS AT THIS TEMPEST UP WHAT WILL I SEE YOU COULD SEEM ANYTHING BUT PRINCIPALLY PRIMARY HE WILL SEE THE TEXT OF THE PLAY AND AS THAT SCROLLS UP THE PLACE STARTS AND YOU'RE READING IT
ABOVE THE TEXT YOU SEE THE ACTORS WERE SPEAKING THE LINES AT YOU NOT TO EACH OTHER DIRECTLY TO YOU
THERE ARE PHOTOGRAPHS AND FILM CLIPS OF PREVIOUS PRODUCTIONS I TALK ABOUT PLAYING PROSPERA
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO READ SHAKESPEARE ON YOUR OWN I KNOW THAT AS AN ACTOR AT THAT TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TEXTS THIS IS THE PERFECT WAY TO HELP YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE COMPANY OF PEOPLE WHO DO
OVER THE YEARS YOU'VE HAD TO UNDERSTAND YOUR CHARACTER FORMER RELATIONSHIP WITH A CHARACTER HAVE YOU OVER THE YEARS FORMED A RELATIONSHIP SHAKESPEARE DO YOU FEEL YOU KNOW HIM
THE CLOSEST I GET TO HAVING A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH SHAKESPEARE IS WHEN I'M REHEARSING TO IMAGINING THAT HE'S JUST NIPPED OUT TO THE LOO AND HE'S GOING TO COME BACK SO WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE DOING WITH MY PLAY
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ACTORS AND DIRECTORS AND DESIGNERS TO SEE THE PLAY FROM SHAKESPEARE'S POINT OF VIEW BUT IS IT ALWAYS CLEAR WHAT THAT POINT OF VIEW IS NO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SHAKESPEARE'S POINT OF VIEW I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WAY THAT SHAKESPEARE
RODE THE DETAIL AND THE COMPLICATIONS WE'RE TALKING AT THE MOMENT IN LONDON WHERE HE LIVED AND WORKED
WENT WHEN THEY DUG UP THE REMAINS OF THE ROSE THEATRE AT THE ACTUAL REMAINS OF ONE OF THOSE VERY VERY FEW SHIT THERE'S A SOME PLAYERS AS WHERE SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS WERE PERFORMED
AND I STOOD ON THE REMAINS OF THE STAGE AND COULD IMAGINE
THE AUDIENCE WOULD BE LIKE ON THE RAISED THEIR AUDITORIUM THAT WAS UNCOVERED UNDER AN OLD BUILDING THAT HAD BEEN DEMOLISHED
IT WAS THRILLING TO THINK OH YEAH HE'D WALKED HERE JUST IN THE SPIRIT OF SHAKESPEARE BEING RELEVANT FOR ALL THE AGES ON THIS FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY HAVE YOU GOT A QUITE FOR ME A QUOTE FOR THE DAY
I THINK I DON'T THINK I CAN DO BETTER THAN SAYING ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN MERELY PLAYERS THAT THAT THAT'S A WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD AND IT WAS SHAKESPEARE AS WELL LOOKING AT THE WORLD IT OFTEN OCCURS THAT MOTION
MACBETH AND HIS DARKEST DARKEST MOMENTS HE'S HE'S TRYING TO DESCRIBE WHAT LIFE IS LIKE
HIS LIFE'S BUT A WALKING SHADOW A POOR PLAYER THAT STRUTS AND FRETS HIS HOUR UPON THE STAGE AND THEN IS HEARD NO MORE HOW REVELS NOW AND IT SERVES PROSPERO THESE OUR ACTORS AS I THOUGHT TOLD YOU WERE ALL SPIRITS OFTEN HE KEEPS COMING BACK AND BACK TO THE IDEA THAT IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOU WERE BEINGS RECTOR HIMSELF WE'RE ALL
THAT'S THE VOICE OF AN ACTOR SPEAKING I THINK SHAKESPEARE MUST HAVE BEEN AN ACTOR HIMSELF THERE'S PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT HE
SO THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO HIM THAN PERHAPS MOST PEOPLE DO BUT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AS AN ACTOR BUT I LIKE SHAKESPEARE IT'S HASN'T AUDIENCE I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF
THEN WE CAN TALK INTO ZOE CONWAY THE DICKIN TWENTY SIX JOHNNY CAME TO

EVENTS ARE BEING HELD ACROSS BRITAIN AND ELSEWHERE HAD TO MARK THE DEATH FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE THE PLAYWRIGHT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE DIED ON THIS ESTATE IN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN AT THE AGE OF FIFTY TWO
TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT IF YOU CAN'T RAISE A HEFTY DEPOSIT YOU CAN'T BUY A HOUSE OR A FLAT IN LONDON THE PRICES HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AN AVERAGED MORE THAN HALF A MILLION POUNDS IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAS DOMINATED THE RACE TO SUCCEED BORIS JOHNSON AS MAYOR OF LONDON SYNDICATE HAS BEEN TO MEET SOME OF THE PEOPLE STRUGGLING
GO TO SCHOOL AND GET A GOOD JOB BUY A HOUSE THAT'S OFTEN THE ADVICE BUT IN LONDON IT'S NOT THAT EASY BUYING A PROPERTY IN LONDON IS JUST IT'S SIMPLY NOT AN OPTION FOR US THERE IS NOTHING ANYWHERE NEAR OUR PRICE RANGE SO WHEN WE REALISE WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND MORE SPACE FOR THE FAMILY
IT WAS A QUESTION OF MOVE OUT OF LONDON OR STAY IN A VERY CRAMPED PLACE HERE KATIE LIVES IN WEST LONDON WITH A HUSBAND AND TWO YOUNG CHILDREN THEIR FLAT IS SMALL AND SHE SAYS IT'S JUST GETTING TOO MUCH
THEY'RE STILL BATHING IN THAT BAR INSIDE THE SHELL WHO WE NEED WE NEED SPACE
YEAH IN THE BATH THIS TIME HE'S FINE YOU'RE HAPPY IT'S READY JUST ONE FOR BABIES AND THEY BOTH SET IN THERE AND WASH THEMSELVES IT'S NOT FEASIBLE
DO YOU LIKE THIS FLAT DO YOU LIKE LIVING HERE I THOUGHT
ON AVERAGE THE COST OF A LONDON HOME HAS RISEN FORTY FOUR PERCENT OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ESTATE AGENTS PREDICTS PRICES WILL ALMOST DOUBLE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS MEANING THE AVERAGE COST OF A HOUSE IN THE CAPITAL WILL BE JUST UNDER A MILLION POUNDS ALL THIS LEAVES LITTLE CHOICE FOR SOME HAD TO MOVE OUT
IT'S HARD KNOWING THAT WE'LL BE SAYING GOODBYE TO FRIENDS TO A COMMUNITY THAT WERE VERY FRONT
FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST OF LONDON WHERE BIG APARTMENT BLOCKS ARE BEING ERECTED
JUST IN FRONT OF ONE OF THOSE NEW BUILDINGS ACROSS FROM BLACKPOOL STATION IT'S WHERE TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD P.R. EXECUTIVE LAURA BROOKS WAS LOOKING TO BUY BUT IN THE END IT SHE SAYS IT WAS JUST TOO EXPENSIVE
I'VE BEEN LOOKING TO BUY SOMEWHERE SINCE THE END OF LAST YEAR AND THE START OF THIS
IT'S JUST BEEN A COMPLETE HEADACHE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IT JUST FEELS LIKE
GENERATION STRUGGLED TO FIND WORK WE STRUGGLED TO HAVE INCOME
SUPPLEMENT A LIFESTYLE THAT IS NORMAL
NOW WE CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE TO LIVE
HOUSING A COLUMNIST FOR HALIFAX MARTIN ELLIS ARGUES THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO SOLVE THE CRISIS
FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE SOLUTION IS REALLY BUILDING MORE HOMES ACTUALLY INCREASING SUPPLY SO IT CAN KEEP UP WITH DEMAND IF WE CAN DO THAT AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY TASK BY ANY MEANS THEN THAT WILL KEEP A CAP ON HOUSE PRICE INFLATION THE CENTRE RIGHT THINK TANK POLICY EXCHANGE THINGS POLITICIANS SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON HOW TO BUILD MORE HOMES ON HOW TO MAKE NEW HOMES MORE POPULAR
ECONOMISTS ALSO SAY INVESTMENT FROM FOREIGN BUYERS IS CONTRIBUTING TO AN INCREASE IN PRICES SAVILL ESTIMATE THAT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THIRTY TWO PER CENT OF ALL PRIME LONDON RESIDENTIAL MARKET BUYERS WERE NON U.K. NATIONALS RICH OVERSEAS INVESTORS DO SEE BUYING A PROPERTY IN LONDON AS PART OF THEIR SORT OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO I THINK IT'S MORE OF A PROBLEM MEANS SOON CENTRAL LONDON DISTRICTS BUT WE SHOULDN'T EXAGGERATE THE IMPACT ON THE WHOLE
RECENT DAYS THERE'VE BEEN REPORTS THAT THE PINE PROPERTY MARKET IN LONDON IS STARTING TO COOL
EXPERTS SAY THIS WILL HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE HOUSING MARKET WITH PRICES EXPECTED TO ONLY GO UP INTO THE LONG TERM FUTURE
LOOK AT HER TO REPORT IN THERE WILL TELL TIM DONOVAN IS A LONDON POLITICAL EDITOR THIS IS A BIG IF NOT THE BIG ISSUE FOR THE CAMPAIGN TIM
IT IS AND HAS BEEN RISEN RIGHT UP THE AGENDA IT WASN'T THE CASE IN THE LAST ELECTIONS AT ALL AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT EMERGED IS IS HOW DIFFICULT I THINK FOR THE FRONT RUNNERS TO GET ACROSS THE SOLUTIONS TO IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO COMPLEX AND I THINK THE REAL CHALLENGE FOR THE ZAC GOLDSMITH AND CALM
THAT THE FAVOURITES TO WIN THIS ONE IT'S DISTILLING THIS IN INTO SIMPLE CONCEPTS GETTING ACROSS YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR HOUSING TARGETS ALL HOW MUCH YOU CAN DO THAT'S AFFORDABLE AND THIS ISSUE OF TRYING TO PRIORITISE FOR LONDONERS YOU KNOW EXPERTS SUGGEST THAT IN A POTENTIALLY THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO IN THE PLANNING SYSTEM OR WITHOUT DRIVING AWAY THE DEVELOPERS ON THEIR FOREIGN INVESTORS WHO YOU NEED TO KIND OF GET THESE DEVELOPERS OFF THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE DO THEY EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO
THEY WANT A NIGHT'S AFFORDABLE HOME FOR EVERY CITIZEN IN LONDON OF COURSE BUT BUT IT'LL BE HANDY TO GET THERE
WELL THEY WERE AGREED THEY WERE AGREED AT THAT WE THAT LONDON NEEDS ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR AND BOTH SLIGHTLY AWKWARD WHEN YOU POINT OUT THAT NO ONE SCOTT ANYWHERE NEAR DOING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IN THE LAST TWO DECADES OR SO THERE'S A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE OF APPROACH IN THAT
SIDIQUE KHAN WOULD WOULD WOODY INTERVENE A LITTLE BIT MORE OR SAYS HE WOULD INTERVENE MORE BE A BIT MORE PRESCRIPTIVE ON WHAT YOU CAN DO ON PRIVATE LAND PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT HOW YOU CAN INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOMES HAVE BEEN BUILT THERE ALL YOU CAN EXCLUDE FOREIGN INVESTORS THAT GOLDSMITH SAYS HE'S BEEN MUCH MORE REALISTIC YES ON THE PUBLIC LAND THAT'S IN THE CAPITAL
THE LAND OWNED BY THE TRANSPORT AGENCIES BY THE N.H.S. OR BY LOCAL COUNCILS IF YOU GET THAT LAND TOGETHER AND FREE IT UP FOR HOUSING YES YOU CAN BE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE THEM ON ON PROVIDING THE KIND OF AFFORDABLE RENTED STARTER HOME PART BUY PART RENT HOUSING AND THEN MAKE A PLIE CONDITIONS TO THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING THOSE HOMES OR RENTING THEM IT'S NEVER BEEN AS BAD AS THIS HAS IT IN LONDON
IT HASN'T NO I MEAN YOU HEAR IN THAT YOU HEAR IN THAT SCENE AS PACKAGE THAT THERE ARE NOT EVERYONE THINKS THIS IS JUST ABOUT SUPPLY IT'S ABOUT
WHAT YOU DO IN TERMS OF ALLOCATION AND WHATEVER THERE ARE THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT RAGING AS WE KNOW ABOUT FOREIGN INVESTMENT WILL BE HERE THEY'RE THE EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT IT TENDS TO IN TERMS OF FOREIGN BUYING UP OF PROPERTIES IT TENDS TO BE IN THAT PRIME MARKET IN THOSE EXCLUSIVE POSTCODES IN KENSINGTON
AND CHELSEA AND WESTMINSTER AND SO ON I MEAN CERTAINLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INCREASING POPULATION LONDON'S INCREASING POPULATION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EVERY YEAR WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THIS FINAL YEAR OF BORIS JOHNSON
FIVE THOUSAND NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES ARE GOING TO BE COMPLETED AND HE HAS BEEN UP NEARER FIFTEEN THOUSAND IN IN SOME OF HIS THE YEARS OF HIS PREVIOUS TENANCY BECAUSE THERE IS A REAL ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS DO YOU GET THE SENSE AT ALL THAT
VERY QUIETLY AND VERY PRIVATELY MANY SENIOR POLITICIANS INCLUDING PERHAPS THE CANDIDATES SAY TO THEM UP THIS PROBABLY IS INSOLUBLE WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT LONDON IS GOING TO BECOME HIS BECOMING PERHAPS HAS BECOME A VERY DIFFERENT CITY AND ONLY WEALTHY PEOPLE RELATIVELY WEALTHY PEOPLE BE ABLE TO AFFORD A LIVER
WELL YOU MAKE A POINT MOST WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SAYING THERE WERE PRIVATELY IT'S NOT CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT THESE TWO FRONT RUNNERS IN THIS CAMPAIGN WOULD EVER ADMIT TO I THINK I THINK EVERYONE IS HE'S GETTING IT IS INCREASINGLY AWARE NOW OF JUST HOW COMPLICATED THIS IS IT'S SUCH A DELICATE ECOLOGY TO KEEP THE DEVELOPERS INTERESTED
IN A CITY IN GETTING STAINS IN THE GROUND AND SO ON IT WOULD BE VERY EASY EXPERTS SAY TO DRIVE THEM AWAY AND THEY START TO LOOK AT OTHER GLOBAL CITIES AND WHICH TO PUT THEIR MONEY IF YOU COME UP WITH PLANNING POLICIES AURA OR MAKE CHANGES TO THE THE PLANNING POLICIES AND THEIR ENSHRINED IN SOMETHING CALLED THE LONDON PLAN IF YOU IF YOU MAKE CHANGES THERE
WHICH DRIVE AWAY THAT KIND OF INVESTMENT AND AN INNOVATION SO WHILE OF COURSE EVERYONE'S FULLY AWARE THAT NEXT GENERATION BUT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS AT THE MOMENT IT LOOKS SO BLEAK IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND TINA GET ON THERE THE OF THE HOUSING LADDER IT IS NOT SO SIMPLE AS TO JUST SAY RIGHT AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO TRY AND CUT THE PRICE OF LAND AND BUILDING CHEAPER TOO MANY THANKS
EIGHTY MINUTES TO EIGHT LOOK AT THE PAPERS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S WARNING THAT A BRITISH EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD PUT THE U.K. AT THE BACK OF THE QUEUE AND DOING TRADE DEALS WITH THE U.S. DOMINATES MANY FRONT AND INSIDE PAGES AND NOT SURPRISINGLY MOST PAPERS VIEW THE INTERVENTION THROUGH THE PRISM OF THEIR OWN POSSESSIONS ON BRECHT SET SO THE FINANCIAL TIMES CALLS IT A POWERFUL STINGING REBUKE TO THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN THE SAYS IT'S THE HEAVY BLOW F.T. SAYS DOWNING STREET WAS DELIGHTED AT THE SIDE OF BORIS JOHNSON OR NIGEL FARAGE
HURLING INSULTS AT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN DAVID CAMERON COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR ANY MORE FROM MY OBAMA IS FRIENDLY ADVICE TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE IT'S YOUR DECISION BUT STAY IN YOU IDIOTS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT THE MALE ACCUSES THE PRESIDENT OF TURNING BULLY BOY BY A STRING WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS AN EXTRAORDINARY THREAT THE SUN SAYS HIS REMARKS AMOUNTED TO BARRACK MALE THE TELEGRAPH NOTES THAT MISTER OBAMA ADMITTED THAT UNCONTROLLED MIGRATION INTO EUROPE WAS A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY BUT HE CONCEDES THAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WILL NOW BE UNDER PRESSURE TO REGAIN LOST MOMENTUM TIME SUGGEST THE PRESIDENT'S USE OF THE WOOD
YOU RATHER THAN THE NORMAL AMERICAN USAGE LINED UP POINTS TO HIS WARNING HAVING BEEN SCRIPTED BY DOWNING STREET THAT'S PLENTY OF SPECULATION ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF POP STAR PRINCE THE DAILY MIRROR SUGGESTS THAT JUST DAYS BEFORE THE STAR MAY HAVE TAKEN AN OVERDOSE OF THE PAINKILLER USED BY MICHAEL JACKSON PRIOR TO HIS DEATH IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
IT SAYS EVERYONE ON BOARD A FLIGHT PRINCE WAS ON AT THE TIME WILL BE QUESTIONED BY POLICE THE PLANE WAS DIVERTED SO THE SINGER COULD RECEIVE EMERGENCY TREATMENT THE SUN AND THE EXPRESS ALSO REPORT CLAIMS THAT PRINCE OVERDOSED ON THE STRONG PAINKILLER
PASS KUH SET ON HIS WAY HOME FROM A SHOW IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN TAKING IT FOR A CHRONIC HIP PROBLEM THE OWNERS OF ALTON TOWERS HAVE ADMITTED BREACHING HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AFTER THAT ROLLER COASTER CRASH WHIPPED BADLY INJURED FIVE PEOPLE IN THE TIMES REPORTS THAT SENIOR STAFF AT THE COMPANY MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS WERE AWARDED SHARE OPTIONS WORTH FOUR MILLION HOMES EARLIER THIS MONTH

IF YOU'RE ON THE POINT OF BUYING A DESIGNER HANDBAG OR DESIGNER SHOES FOR A FEW HUNDRED QUID FORGET IT LUXURY DUVETS THAT'S THE MUST HAVE THING NOW IT SEEMS THAT IF THE FEATHERS HAVEN'T BEEN HAND PICKED FROM AN ELDER DUCKS NEST IN ICELAND
WELL NOBODY SAILS A PREMIUM DUVETS AND SILK PILLOWS LOOK ARE SAID TO BE SOARING AS WEALTHY SHOPPERS SEEKER GOODNIGHT SLEEP JOHN LEWIS IS STARTING THE CELL A TEN THOUSAND POUND DUVET AFTER DEMAND FOR PRICEY BED LINEN NEARLY DOUBLED IN IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SILK
BELOW WHICH OFTEN STRONGLY SONG QUARTER TO EIGHT IS THE TIME TIME FOR MEET THE AUTHOR WAY AWAY FROM SILK PILLOWS AND IT'S PRICEY DEBATES JIM HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO THE SHOCK ALLOW NOVELIST JOANNE HARRIS WHO BEGAN LIFE TEACHING IN THE NORTH
FOR HER LATEST NOVEL BUT DIFFERENT CLASS JOANNE HARRIS IS BACK IN SCHOOL SAINT OSWALD'S GRAMMAR SCHOOL WILL SHE SET TO PREVIOUS BOOKS AND ALTHOUGH SHE SAYS SHE THINKS OF IT AS A COMIC NOVEL THE COMEDY
IS DARKER THAN EVER FOR ONE OF OUR MOST PROLIFIC AND MOST READ AUTHORS CHUCKLE I WAS OF COURSE ARE INTERNATIONAL BEST SELLER AND A MEMORABLE FILM THE CLASSROOMS AND THE CORRIDORS OF THE SCHOOL AT THE SETTING FOR A STORY OF AFFECTION AND SEXUAL JEALOUSY AND HATE DECEPTION
AND VIOLENCE AND AN EXPLORATION OF SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TEACHERS AND PUPILS AND THE HAVOC THAT THEY CAN SOMETIMES REEK
I LOVED SCHOOLS I TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I WAS GOOD AT MY JOB AND I FOUND THAT EVERY DAY WAS A STAGE FOR TRAGEDY AND FARCE AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL THING FOR A KIND OF AN EMERGING ALSO TO HAVE THIS THIS POSSIBILITY TO OBSERVE PEOPLE AT WORK CAN BE THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY FORM
IT'S ALSO TRUE ISN'T IT THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH IN TERMS OF THE PUPILS PEOPLE WHO ARE AT A VERY VULNERABLE POINT IN THEIR LIVES AND THEREFORE FROM AN AUTHOR'S POINT OF VIEW
A DELICIOUS STAGE OF THEIR LIVES ABSOLUTELY VULNERABLE VOLATILE WILDLY ENTHUSIASTIC OFTEN EXPERIENCING THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS A THIRD FORM TUTOR AND I KIND OF THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AGE GROUP IT'S IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING I MEAN THEY CAN BE QUITE TROUBLESOME THEY CAN BE NAUGHTY BUT THEY'RE ALSO DISCOVERING SAINTS AND THE LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM AND IT'S JUST IT'S JUST RATHER RATHER LOVELY TO WORK WITH THAT AGE GROUP
YOU MUST HAVE FOUND YOURSELF IN THE COURSE OF WRITING THIS COMING UP AGAINST PUBLIC DISCUSSION
OF SEXUAL QUESTIONS INVOLVING YOUNG PEOPLE IN INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS BUT PROBABLY
WENT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IN THE SAME WAY WHEN YOU BEGAN HOW DID YOU REACT TO THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN I STARTED WRITING THE BOOK OPERATION YEWTREE HADN'T REALLY STARTED TO UNFOLD AND WHILE I WAS WRITING IT ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS THIS PARALLEL STORY WAS HAPPENING WHICH HAD
YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF ANALOGIES THAT COULD BE DRAWN AND YOU TOUCH ON THE HORROR OF THE FALSE ACCUSATION AS WELL YES THE FALSE ACCUSATION BUT ALSO THE THE IDEAS AT THE PAST
IS IT'S NOT A SERIES OF IMMUTABLE IMAGES AND THAT MEMORY IS NOT A VIDEO CAMERA BUT IN A SENSE ARE MORE ON THE UNLIKE STRUCTURE WITH LAYERS THAT HAVE TO BE PEELED AWAY BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY GET TO WHAT REALLY HAPPENED YOU ARE A VERY MUCH LOVED AUTHOR YOU'VE SOLD MILLIONS OF BOOKS SHOCK ALLOWED TO MENTION AT THE BEGINNING WAS OF COURSE AN INTERNATIONAL BEST SELLER OF GARGANTUAN PROPORTIONS
YOU FEEL VERY STRONGLY FOR THE POSITION OF THE AUTHOR PARTICULARLY MAYBE THE AUTHOR WAS JUST STARTING OUT AT A YOUNG AGE YES I THINK SO I THINK BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO IT SEEMS AS IF WE'RE JUST SPINNING THIS IMAGINARY STRAW INTO GOLD AND I THINK TO THE ORDINARY PERSON WHO WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT A WRITER'S LIFE INVOLVES IT SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A NON JOB AND THEY ARE SURPRISED THAT ANYBODY AND EARNS A LIVING AND IN FACT MANY PEOPLE DON'T EARN A LIVING BUT THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT IT'S NOT A PROPER JOB
I KNOW A LOT OF YOUNGER AUTHORS AND PEOPLE WHO WERE HER MEDALLIST AUTHORS WHO DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE A LIVING OUT OF IT WHO HAVE TO FACTOR IN THEIR OWN EXPENSES
BEFORE ACCEPTING TO GO TO A FESTIVAL THEY HAVE TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST THEM AND SOME JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO DO IT SO HE HAD TO TALK IN SCHOOLS FOR IT EXACTLY AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AN AUTHOR'S TIME IS WORTH PAYING FOR AND THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST PHILANTHROPISTS WHO GO AROUND GIVING JOY TO PEOPLE AND DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING BACK LOVELY TALK ABOUT YOUR WORKING ENVIRONMENT BRIEFLY BECAUSE
IT IS THE CLASSIC OATH ORIEL SETTING ISN'T IT IT'S A SHED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN IT IS A SHED YES IT'S RATHER NICE SHED BUT IT'S A SHED NEVERTHELESS
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE ONE'S OWN SPACE I THINK NOT EVERYBODY CAN CAN AFFORD THE SPACE TO HAVE A LARGE SPACE OF THEIR OWN BUT WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE YOU HAD THE SHED WELL I WORKED ON THE FLOOR ACTUALLY WITH MY LAPTOP BECAUSE I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A DESK FOR MANY YEARS I HAD INSTEAD I HAD TWO OBJECTS WHICH I WOULD PUT IN FRONT OF MY LAPTOP WHEN I WAS WORKING AND THAT WAS MY TRIGGER DID YOU FIND THAT EVEN WHEN YOU HAD TO OBJECT ON THE FLOOR WHERE THE INJURED
A CANDLESTICK AND A PAPERWEIGHT SIMPLE AS THAT EXACTLY I STILL HAVE THEM BUT THEY'RE NOW IMAGINARY AND I TAKE THEM AROUND IN MY HEAD AND I CAN JUST VISUALISE THEM THEY'RE SO IF I'M IN A HOTEL ROOM OR ON A PLANE I DON'T ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY HAVE TO BRING OUT THE CANDLESTICK AND THE PICKLE QUICK I KNOW YOU ENJOY SOCIAL MEDIA QUITE A BIT ON TWITTER AND ALL THE REST OF IT DO YOU FIND PEOPLE'S COMING BACK AND SEEING IT
YOU PUT ME IN THAT BOOK THEY DON'T QUITE SAY THAT BUT THERE'S OFTEN A KIND OF KNOWING WINK AT THINGS THAT THEY THINK THEY'VE RECOGNISED ANOTHER USUALLY RIGHT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE RIGHT I THINK THE THING ABOUT HAVING TAUGHT IN MANY SCHOOLS AND BEEN TAUGHT IN MANY SCHOOLS IS THAT YOU CAN BORROW LITTLE BITS AND PIECES AND YOU CAN MAKE SOMETHING WHICH IS ENTIRELY FICTIONAL I'M GET COMPLETELY RECOGNISABLE FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY LIKE THAT DRIVE SOME PEOPLE MAD AND THEY TRY TO AVOID IT AND WHY DO YOU TAKE THE OTHER
I LIKE IT PARTLY BECAUSE I FOUND THAT WHEN I WAS TEACHING A GREAT DEAL OF MY CREATIVE ENERGY CAME FROM THE HUMAN INTERACTION THAT I HAD EVERY DAY AT SCHOOL AND SOMETIMES IT WAS EXHAUSTING SOMETIMES IT WAS AN OVERLOAD BUT IT REALLY WAS AT THE HEART OF MY WORK AND WHEN I LEFT TEACHING I WAS SLIGHTLY AFRAID THAT I WOULD MISS THAT
AND MISS THE ENERGY THAT I GOT BETWEEN LESSONS IN GOING INTO THE STAFFROOM AND TAKING FIVE MINUTES OR TALK TO PEOPLE AND READ THE PAPER NOWADAYS TWITTER IS MY STUFF FOR HIM IT'S MY WATER COOLER IT'S WHERE I GO TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE SO THAT I'M NOT JUST ALONE IN THE SHED ALL DAY JOANNE HARRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

AGEING RELATIVES OR NEIGHBOURS MAY SEEM TO PRODUCE VERY LITTLE IN A WORLD OF MEASUREMENTS WHAT THEY DELIVER IS HARD TO QUANTIFY IN AN AGE OF SPEED AND EFFICIENCY THEY USUALLY TAKE THE SCENIC ROUTE WE SEE THEIR PHYSICAL FRAILTY OR FAILING MEMORY AND FAILED TO NOTICE THAT WHILE THEY MADE THEIR MISTAKES THEY MAY ALSO HAVE LEARNT FROM THEM TO OUR INFORMATION SOCIETY THEY BRING WISDOM
AMERICANS CALL THEM SENIORS AN IMPROVEMENT ON OLD PEOPLE ALL THE ELDERLY BUT LIKE MORE ANCIENT CULTURES PERHAPS WE SHOULD RECOGNISE THESE PEOPLE AS ELDERS KEEPERS OF THE WISDOM SOCIETY

AGE PEOPLE BELIEVED TO BE RELATED HAD BEEN KILLED IN A SERIES OF SHOOTINGS IN THE UNITED STATES OF THAT STATE OF OHIO AND EVENTS ARE BEING HELD IN BRITAIN AND AROUND THE WORLD TO MARK FOUR HUNDRED YEARS SINCE SHAKESPEARE SHUFFLED OFF THIS MORTAL COIL TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS CODY CORFIELD PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL EMBARK ON THE SECOND FULL DAY OF HIS VISIT TO BRITAIN THIS MORNING WITH THE BROW OVER HIS INTERVENTION IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN SHOWING NO SIGN OF ABATING
HE'S DUE TO MEET THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN AND TO VISIT THE GLOBE THEATRE IN LONDON AS PART OF THE CELEBRATIONS MARKING THE FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF SHAKESPEARE'S DEATH BUT THE DECISION HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY HIS DIRECT AND PASSIONATE APPEAL IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN PARTICULAR HIS WARNING THAT THE U.K. COULD NOT EXPECT A SEPARATE TRADE DEAL WITH THE U.S. ANY TIME SOON A BIT BOATED TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAS INCENSE THOSE CAMPAIGNING FOR A BRITISH EXIT HE'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN
AS BARACK OBAMA'S VISIT TO BRITAIN DRAWS TO A CLOSE HIS UNEXPECTEDLY FORTHRIGHT INTERVENTION IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WILL BE CELEBRATED BY THE REMAIN SIDE BUT THE PRESIDENT LEAVES A STORM OF CONTROVERSY BEHIND HIM TO VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAVE RUBBISHED HIS STATEMENT THAT BRITAIN OUTSIDE THE Y. YOU WOULD BE AT THE BACK OF THE QUEUE FOR A TRADE DEAL WITH THE U.S. THE JUSTICE MINISTER AND VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNER DOMINIC ROB A QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S MOTIVATIONS
I'VE GOT NO DOUBT THAT FUTURE U.S. TRADE NEGOTIATOR CAN LOOK TO OTHER OPPORTUNITIES I THINK BRITAIN WILL BE AT THE FIRST IN THE QUEUE NOT AT THE BACK OF THE QUEUE BUT I THINK THIS TODAY WAS REALLY ABOUT LAME DUCK U.S. PRESIDENT ABOUT TO MOVE OFF THE STAGE DO YOU KNOW BRITISH FRIEND OR POLITICAL FAVOUR
THE USE OF THE PHRASE BACK OF THE QUEUE RATHER THAN THE AMERICAN VERNACULAR BACK OF THE LINE WAS SEIZED UPON BY VOTE LEAVE WHO SAID IT WAS OBVIOUS MY OBAMA'S WORDS WERE WRITTEN IN NUMBER TEN DOWNING STREET NOT THE WHITE HOUSE IT IS UNDERSTOOD THERE WAS SOME UNEASE AT ITS USE AMONG WHITE HOUSE STAFF HOWEVER A DOWNING STREET SOURCE DISMISSED THE CRITICISM SAYING THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF
FOLLOWING MISTER OBAMA'S FOCUS ON THE TRADE DEBATE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAVE TODAY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION THE FORMER WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS CLAIMED THAT THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WILL LEAD TO A STAMPEDE OF E.U. MIGRANTS TO BRITAIN'S BORDERS
N.H.S. ENGLAND HAS HER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE LATEST STRIKE ACTION BEING TAKEN BY JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THEIR DISPUTE ABOUT A NEW CONTRACT THEY'RE DUE TO WITHDRAW THEIR LABOUR NEXT TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY IN THE FIRST FULL WALK OUT IN THE HISTORY OF THE N.H.S. WHICH WILL INCLUDE THOSE WORKING IN EMERGENCY CARE PATIENTS ARE BEING TOLD TO EXPECT DELAYS DURING A TIME OF WHAT N.H.S. ENGLAND CALLS HEIGHTENED TO RISK OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT SOPHIE HUTCHINSON REPORTS
HOSPITAL BOSSES IN ENGLAND SAY ALL N.H.S. TRUSTS ARE NOW READY TO FACE THIS HISTORIC WALKOUT BY JUNIOR DOCTORS THEY SAY PLANS ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SERVICES SUCH AS EMERGENCY CARE MATERNITY AND RESUSCITATION NEVERTHELESS THE N.H.S. IS WARNING OVER THE TWO DAYS OF STRIKES THERE WILL BE AN IMPACT ALMOST ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN POSTPONED AND ALMOST THIRTEEN THOUSAND ELECTIVE OPERATIONS
THAT'S MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY OPERATIONS AS FOR PREVIOUS STRIKES BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER A TWO WEEK PERIOD SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE SAID A LONGER PLANNING PROCESS HAD BEEN NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF THIS INDUSTRIAL ACTION THE DOCTORS' UNION THE B.M.A. HAS SAID IT REGRETS THE DISRUPTION
THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL HE'S TRAVELLING TO TURKEY TO PROMOTE A DEAL BREACH LAST MONTH TO MANAGE THE MIGRANT CRISIS TOGETHER WITH THE E.U. PRESIDENT DONALD TO ARE SCANNED BY IS PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FRANZ TIMMERMAN SHALL VISIT GAZIANTEP A TOWN ON THE BORDER WITH SYRIA THE THREE WOULD ALSO HOLD TALKS WITH THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER I MET DUBU LUTALO SELLING GEAR IT'S REPORTS FROM GUERNSEY TAP
ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS REACHING GREASE FROM TURKEY HAS DROPPED BY AROUND EIGHTY PERCENT FEWER YOUR EXPERTS HAVE ARRIVED IN THE FIELD AND MANY Y. YOU NATIONS DRAGGING THEIR FUSE TO EXCEPT MORE MIGRANTS IN
THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL SAID THE AIM OF THEIR VISIT IS TO SEE THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF THE MIGRANTS IN TURKEY THE COUNTRY ALREADY HORST'S MORE THAN TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION SYRIAN MIGRANTS AT A COST OF OVER SEVEN BILLION POUNDS ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT FIGURES THE YEW HAS PLEDGED UP TO FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION POUNDS IN AID TO TURKEY OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS BUT ALCA EXPECTS MORE STEPS LIKE THESE ARE FREE TRAVEL FOR ITS CITIZENS WILLING TO GO TO EUROPE
THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES AS TURKEY'S PRIME MINISTER UM IT'S DEVIL DOLL HAS WARNED THAT THE WHOLE DEAL COULD COLLAPSE IF THAT E.U. FAILS TO MEET THIS DEMAND
PLEASE SEND THE UNITED STATES SAY AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN RURAL OHIO HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS EXECUTION STYLE KILLINGS THE VICTIMS ARE FOUND IN FOUR PLACES NEAR EACH OTHER A HUGE HUNT IS UNDERWAY FOR THE KILLER LAURA BAKER REPORTS
IT'S BELIEVED THE VICTIMS SEVEN ADULTS AND A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BOY ARE FROM THE SAME FAMILY THEY WERE FOUND AT FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ALONG THE SAME ROAD THEY WERE ALL SHOT IN THE HEAD
THREE YOUNG CHILDREN SURVIVED THE SHOOTING ONE WAS A FOUR DAY OLD CHILD WHO WAS FOUND IN BED NEXT TO HER MOTHER POLICE BELIEVE THE KILLINGS WERE TARGETED AND THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR A MORTARS AND A SUSPECT THEY SAY THERE'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS ARMED AND INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS AND THEY'VE WARNED OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SAME FAMILY TO BE VIGILANT
AN ANALYSIS OF JIHADI GROUPS HAS CONCLUDED THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A TYPICAL JIHADIST AND THAT TOO LITTLE IS BEING DONE TO SMASH THE NETWORKS THEY FORM ON THE ROUTE TO TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT BY THE CENTRE ON RELIGION AND GEO POLITICS PART OF HER FAITH AT THINK TANK SET UP BY TONY BLAIR IT'S REPORT CALLS ON GOVERNMENTS TO BEGIN URGENT WORK TO BUILD WHAT'S DESCRIBED AS A FIRE BREAK THAT WOULD PREVENT THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS EMERGING DOMINIKA SHE ONLY REPORTS
IT'S NOW A CYST LOOKS AT THE LIFE STORY OF ONE HUNDRED LEADING JIHADISTS FIGURES CHELSEA HOW THEY ROSE TO THE TOP HOW THEY'VE SUSTAINED THEIR POSITIONS AND THE TYPES OF ORGANISATIONS THEY'VE DEVELOPED TO NURTURE THE NEXT GENERATION BEHIND THEM
WHILE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS FOCUSED ON MILITARILY DEFEATING THE AUTHOR'S ARGUMENT TOO LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE TO CHALLENGE THE NETWORKS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OVER DECADES TO ENCOURAGE RECRUITS IN THEIR PERSONAL JOURNEY TOWARDS EXTREMISM
ALMOST ALL OF THE CURRENT JIHADI LEADERSHIP HAVE SOME KIND OF LINK BACK TO AFGHANISTAN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE AUTHOR'S WORN SYRIA IS ITS MODERN DAY EQUIVALENT A NETWORKING EVENT OF SEISMIC PROPORTIONS IN WHICH JIHADI NOVICES FROM AROUND THE WORLD CAN BECOME BATTLE HARDENED ALONGSIDE VETERANS AND IN TIME USE THOSE SKILLS TO FURTHER EXPAND A WEB OF GLOBAL EXTREMISM
EVENTS ARE BEING HELD ACROSS THE U.K. AND BEYOND TO MARK THE DEAD FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE MAN WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE THE WORLD'S GREATEST PLAYWRIGHT WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE THE BARGES BELIEVED TO HAVE DIED ON THIS STAGE HIS FIFTY SECOND BIRTHDAY IN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN AND FOR THE PAST YEAR ACTORS WRITERS AND ENTHUSIASTS HAVE BEEN CELEBRATING HIS LIFE AND WORK THE COMMEMORATIONS WILL CENTRE ON STRATFORD UPON AVON IN WARWICKSHIRE WHERE HE WAS BORN AND WHERE HE WAS LAID TO REST OUR ARTS CORRESPONDENT LEE SUMMER ZIMBA REPORTS

THIS HARNESS HERE IS KEEP MEAT TO THE TREADMILL HUMP HERE ON BOARD THE SPACE STATION IS ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF MY BODY WEIGHT
THE TREADMILL QUENT MAKES QUITE A LOT OF NOISE SO I'M GOING TO BE ANTI SOCIAL
AND PUT ON MY MUSIC
MAJOR TEN PEAK THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT FIGHT TO BE THE NEXT MAYOR OF LONDON HAS TURNED PRETTY NASTY IT COULD HAVE BEEN AN INTRIGUING CONTEST BETWEEN THE TWO LEADING CANDIDATES ONE THE SON OF A BUS DRIVER THE OTHER THE SON OF A BILLIONAIRE BUT INSTEAD IT'S BECOME A SHOUTING MATCH WITH ACCUSATIONS OF EXTREMISM AND ISLAMOPHOBIA BEING FLUNG AROUND HERE'S DAVID CAMERON IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS REPEATING ACCUSATIONS THAT THE LABOUR CANDIDATE SAID THE KHAN HAS SHARED PLATFORMS WITH EXTREMISTS
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO NOT BACK THESE PEOPLE WE DO NOT APPEAR ON PLATFORMS WITH THEM AND I HAVE TO SAY I AM CONCERNED ABOUT LABOUR'S CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR OF LONDON WHO HAS
HE SAID HE CAN'T HE'S WITH ME IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SHARE AND DAVID CAMERON'S THOUGHTS ON THAT WOULDN'T THEY WELL I'VE BEEN FIGHTING EXTREMISM ALL MY LIFE THE FIRST TIME I STOOD FOR PARLIAMENT AS TO BE THE M.P. FOR TOOTING
IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THERE EXTREMIS PROTESTING AGAINST ME OUTSIDE MOSS SIDE WORSHIPPED IN ALL MY LIFE SAYING THAT I WAS AN APOSTATE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO TAKE PART IN INVERTED COMMAS MAN MADE LAW I'M TELLING ANYBODY WHO'S GOING INTO THE MOSQUE WHO WAS GOING TO BE SUPPORTING ME THAT THEY WERE DESTINED TO GO TO HELL FOR TAKING PART IN DEMOCRACY ON THE PERSON WHO WHEN I FLOATED FOR SAME SEX MARRIAGE KNOWN IT'S CONTROVERSIAL IN MANY FAITH COMMUNITIES
HAD A FATWA AGAINST ME AND I TO DISCUSS WITH MY DAUGHTERS AND MY WIFE POLICE PROTECTION I AM THE KIND THAT WERE THEY PLAN HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEFEAT EXTREMISM WROTE HAVE HERE INSIDE IS MUSLIM BUT YOU HAVE THE SHARED CAN BUT PLATFORMS WITH
PEOPLE THAT MANY REGARD AS VERY UNSAVOURY INDEED YOU MUST REGRET THAT I HAVE NEVER RUN AWAY FROM THE FACT OR HIT IN THE FACT THAT BEFORE I BECAME A POLITICIAN I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT AFTER YOU BECAME A POLITICIAN I KNOW YOU'RE A HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT AFTER YOU BECAME POLITICIAN YOU WERE STILL DOING THAT I WANT TO LOOK LIKE ZAC GOLDSMITH AND LIKE BORIS JOHNSON OFTEN YOU GO TO MEETINGS IF YOU BELIEVE IN CAUSES WHERE PEOPLE BEFORE YOU PEOPLE AFTER YOU HAVE UNSAVOURY REVIE'S I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE
ZAC GOLDSMITH BORIS JOHNSON AND ME ALL CAMPAIGNED AGAINST THE U.S.A. U.K. EXTRADITION TREATY THAT MEANT SPEAKING AT EVENTS WHERE THE SPEAKERS EITHER BEFORE US OR AFTER AS MAYBE PEOPLE WE HER WE ARE DISAGREE WITH AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU REPORTED IT OFTEN YOU TURN UP SOMEBODY SPOKEN BEFORE YOU OR ARE YOU LEAVING SOMEBODY SPEAKS AFTER YOU I THINK NOBODY WHO KNOWS ME
NO BUT I'VE BEEN ABOUT ALL MY LIFE I THINK THAT I SUBSCRIBE TO THE VIEW THAT IT'S NOT JUST YOUR CONSERVATIVE OPPONENTS WHO CRITICISE THAT SORT OF THING THAT ATTITUDE YVETTE COOPER AS YOU WILL KNOW ATTACKED JEREMY CORBIN CRITICISED HIM JEREMY CORBIN WHEN HE BECAME LEADER DURING THE LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN
I WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THOSE DECISION SHE SAID TO SIT ON PLATFORMS OR MEETINGS IN THE WAY THAT HE DID BUT I CAN'T BE ANY CLEARER I'M THE PERSON THAT'S BEEN FIGHT INEQUALITY INJUSTICE ALL MY LIFE BOTH AS AS A LAWYER AND NOW AS A POLITICIAN UNDER PERCY'S GOT A PLAN NOT SIMPLY TO KEEP LONDON SAFE
ALL RIGHT I DON'T KNOW THEY WERE INTO A DEAL WITH THESE SHELF INTEGRATION DEFEAT EXTREMISM ISN'T USING THE EXPERIENCES I'VE GOT A ZIT BRITISH MUST ALL RIGHT BUT DO YOU REGRET ANY OF THOSE MEETINGS THAT YOU ATTENDED WHERE THERE WERE PEOPLE THERE WHO YOU WOULD NOT WOULD NOT REGARD AS ACCEPTABLE
I REGRET THE FACT THAT THIS ELECTION HAS TURNED INTO ONE THAT'S VERY I REGRET ANYTHING YOU'VE DONE YOURSELF IN THE PAST A LOT LOOK JOHN I'VE NEVER HIDDEN THE FACT THAT I WAS A HUMAN RIGHTS IF YOU WERE GOING YOU DONE AS A POLITICIAN ANY PLATFORM SHE SHARED AND YOU THINK NOW WE'VE DONE THAT AS A POLITICIAN I'VE TRIED TO ENCOURAGE ALL MINORITY COMMUNITIES TO GET INVOLVED IN MAINSTREAM SOCIETY HOW HOW WILL YOUR A MUSLIM FAITH INFLUENCE
YOUR TIME IF YOU BECOME MAYOR HOW WILL YOUR MUSLIM FAITH INFORM YOUR PERIOD AS MEL WHAT I THINK I'M LIKE MOST I'M LIKE MOST LONDONERS I HAVE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF MY IDENTITY I'M A LONDONER I'M EUROPEAN I'M BRITISH I'M ENGLISH
ESPECIALLY TODAY THEY WHAT DAY IT IS I'M OF ISLAMIC FAITH I'M OF ASIAN ORIGIN OF PAKISTANI HERITAGE I'M A DAD I'M A HUSBAND I'M A LONG SUFFERIN LIVERPOOL FAN IF YOU TOOK MY SOUTH LONDON ACCENT AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE PART AND PARCEL OF WHO I AM I'VE GOT FRIENDS FROM DIFFERENT FAITHS JEWISH CHRISTIAN HINDU BUDDHIST SIX THOSE WHO WANT A MEMBER AND ORGANISED FAITH PART OF MY CAMPAIGN INVOLVES OLD YOUNG RICH POOR AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT LONDON IS WE AREN'T SIMPLY TOLERATES DIFFERENCE WE RESPECT AND CELEBRATE IT
WELL BUT BUT ISLAM DOESN'T NECESSARILY DOES IT AND IF YOU ARE WHAT LET ME ASK YOU HOW YOU WOULD DESCRIBE YOURSELF ON THE ISLAMIC CONTINUITY IF I PUT IT LIKE THAT ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE VERY OBSERVANT OF MUSLIM IF THAT'S THE RIGHT EXPRESSION TO USE A MUSLIM HE TRIED MY BEST I TRY AND PRAY WHEN I CAN I'M OFTEN I'M AFRAID FOR MUMS LISTEN I'M SORRY PRAY LATE SOMETIMES I FAST ROO MONTH OF RAMADAN I GIVE MONEY TO
CHARITY THE GOLDEN THREAD RUNNING THROUGH ALL THE THE RELIGIONS HISTORY OTHERS LIKE YOU WANT TO BE IT WILL BE SHUT DOWN SHOULD BE A QUARTZ FOR INSTANCE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY EXISTED TRIBUNALS I THINK THAT THE REQUEST TRIBUNALS I THINK THEY'RE AT THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES IF FOR EXAMPLE THEY ARE THEY ARE SUPERIOR TO OUR LOT OUR LORD OUR LAWS TRUMP ANY OTHER LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY WE USE THE WITCH SORRY BY THE WAY
IT MEANS THINGS LIKE FOOD THAT'S A FORMER SHOW ONLY BUT WE KNOW ALSO WHAT WOMEN WE KNOW THAT IF I ABSOLUTELY INTO SOME OF THESE TRY THAT WHERE A WOMAN CAN GO ALONG AND THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS THE HORSE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SO SHE'S CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND CLOSE HIM DOWN WITH THE ROCKERS AND I SPOKE ABOUT THIS WHEN I WAS THE MINISTERING GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS IN OPPOSITION I'M QUITE CLEAR IN WRETCH THIS CONCERNS ABOUT THE INNER CORE LIKE SO TO BE LIKE THAT YOU WOULD DO YOUR BEST TO CLOSE THEM DOWN WHERE THEY EXIST ARE YOU ASK A QUESTION YES THE ISSUES ABOUT ABOUT HOW THE SHARIA COURTS I WERE COMMISSIONED WHICH NEED SYMPTOM WORKING ABOUT YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT WHO I AM
ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEING A LABOUR CANDIDATE BUT ALSO SOMEBODY WHO'S A LONDONER IS WHEN I GO FOR EXAMPLE TO HONECKER IN THE SQUARE JEWISH FESTIVAL WHEN I CELEBRATE WITH MY FRIENDS
THERE ARE MODEL SADO DURING PASSOVER OR WHEN I GO TO A SIKH GRID TOMORROW TO CELEBRATE SAKE OR TO A HINDU TEMPLE CELEBRATES IN DO ALI OR TO A CHURCH CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS AND EASTER I THINK I THINK IT'S REALLY FANTASTIC BECAUSE THERE AREN'T MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD WE'D GET LONDONERS COMING TOGETHER ENJOYING EACH OTHER'S COMPANY BEEN FRIENDS SUPPORT EACH OTHER'S CAMPAIGN AS WE'VE GOT HERE IN LONDON I THINK WE CAN BE A BEACON FOR THE REST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD
BUT LONDON CAN ELECT EMIR WAS ONLY FIVE FOOT SIX BUT YOU KNOW HE'S DRUNK BUT HE'S A BUS DRIVER RAISED ON A COUNCIL ESTATE HE WENT FROM WENT FROM THERE TO RUN A BUSINESS HAD BEEN A MINISTER TELLING ALL RIGHT ON THE NET END OF P.P.P. BUT BUT BUT IN PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO TACKLE EXTREMISM BUT HE'S NOT
BEING DONE AT THE MOMENT A NUMBER OF THINGS FIRSTLY THE FIRST PARTY I WAS MADE TO KEEP OUR CITY SAFE SO THERE'LL BE A MAJOR REVIEW IN RELATION TO OUR SERVICES IN RELATION TO EXTREMISM WE'VE GOTTA MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE INTEGRATING THE RELIEVE IS THAT THE MAYOR'S GOT BUT ALSO PERSUASION IS VERY IMPORTANT WE'VE GOT TO BE CLOSING DOWN THOSE WEBSITES THAT ARE RADICALISING LONDONERS IN THEIR BEDROOM THREE YOUNG LONDONERS LAST YEAR GIRLS JOHN
BASICALLY GROOMED AND BRAINWASHED IN THEIR BEDROOM BY THE INTERNET AND THEN JUMPED ON A PLANE TO BECOME THE BRIDES OF THESE MEN IN SYRIA WE'VE GOT ARE MAKING SURE WHEN IT COMES TO BRITISH ROLE MODELS WHO ARE INTEGRATED THAT THEY WERE WE PROMOTE THEM WE'VE GOT TO GIVE SUPPORT TO BRITISH MUSLIMS WHO ARE TACKLING THESE RADICALS IN EXTREMIS
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE THEY CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOU NOW SUPPORT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CARRY ON CELEBRATING THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT A CITY WHICH IS YOU CAN BE A LONDONER AND THE BRITISH THE LONDONER AND DARE I SAY THERE IS ONE THING THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE IN LONDON CARE ABOUT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE HEARD
REPORT FROM SUPER FROM EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME AND THAT IS THE PRICE OF HOUSING AGAIN IN PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BRING DOWN THE PRICE OF HOUSES A HUGE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEM AS A HELL'S AND AS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FACING LONDON WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS SO WHAT YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT I'M GOING TO BRING TOGETHER A TEAM OF EXPERTS IN WHAT I CALL HOMES FOR LONDONERS LOCAL AUTHORITY HAVE THE HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS
DEVELOPERS AND THOSE WITH FINANCE WITHIN A BRIDGE GET THEIR LAND AND FINANCE TO BUILD THE GENUINELY AFFORDABLE HOMES LONDON AS EVIL AND EVERY POLITICIAN I'VE TALKED TO SINCE GOD WAS A BOY A SETTEE FELL AT THE EXACTLY THE SAME I WANT TO BE FAIR I'M NOT ANY OLD POLITICIAN ONLY THE ONE YOU WERE AND SO AND SO WHAT THE DIESEL EXAMPLES WE CAN DO BEFORE HOMES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED THEIR SOUL TO INVESTORS THE MIDDLE EASTERN ASIA
THAT CAN'T BE HAPPENING SO BE THIRTY LONDONERS SO NEW HOMES THAT ARE BUILT ON PUBLIC LAND ONLY LONDONERS KOVACS TRIED THE RENT OR POP BY PART RING THEM WHEN IT COMES TO WOULD YOU STOP THAT HAPPENING I'M A DEVELOPER BUILD HOMES ON WHEN YOU SAY PUBLIC LAND IF IT'S FOR INSTANCE TRUST TRANSPORT FOR LONDON LAMB THAT HAPPENED TO BE SOLD OFF TO A DEVELOPER YOU WOULD SAY TO THAT I GOT TO SEE YOU YOU'VE ACTUALLY TOUCHED BOTH POINT THE CURRENT MAYOR
HE'S HAVING A FIRE SALE OF PUBLIC LAND I'M SAYING IS KEEP THE FREEHOLD BUILD GENUINE AFFORDABLE HOMES ON THE FREEHOLD LAND THAT WE OWN AND YOU WIN A LOWLY ENVELOPMENT IS TO BUILD THOSE HOUSES ONLY IF THEY SOLD THEM TO LOCAL PEOPLE THEY'LL BE RENTED IN LONDON EITHER A SOCIAL RENT OR A LONDON LIVING RENT A THIRD OF AVERAGE EARNINGS OR POT BY PACT WOULD BE TINY THAT WORLD FOR INSTANCE IF WE WERE LOOKING AT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED QUID AMMANFORD BE WILLING TO RENT WOULD BE SIX HUNDRED POUNDS A MONTH AND EXAMPLE
SO THE MAYOR OF LONDON TRANSPORT FILAMENT OWNS LAND EQUIVALENT TO SIXTEEN TIMES HYDE PARK WE CAN USE SOME OF THAT SURPLUS LAD BILL GENERALLY FORDABLE HOMESTEADS ALSO BROWN FOR SIX HUNDRED POUNDS A MONTH RENT IN SOME PARTS OF LONDON WHERE THE WHERE THE WRECK WITH THE AVERAGE EARNINGS IN ONE BOROUGH IS EIGHTY WHAT DEVELOPER WOULD BUILD ON THEIR LIVES IN RED WAS ONLY GOING TO GET SIX HUNDRED POUNDS A MONTH WE HAD WITHOUT IT THE BEAUTY OF THE PUBLIC LAND IS KEEP THE FREEHOLD BILL JENNY FALL THE HOMES ON THAT LAND RATHER THAN SELLING OFF IN A FIGHT
THAT'S THE HISTORY OF OF HOMES THAT THAT WAS JUNIOR FULL BELOW HOW SOON WILL HOW SOON WILL THERE BE NEW HOMES IN LONDON AVAILABLE TO RENT AT SIX HUNDRED POUNDS A MONTH SO IT WAS SO THE LAND IS NOW AVAILABLE FROM TRON FOR LONG AND WE THINK WE CAN MOVE PRETTY QUICKLY IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS I LIKE TO SEE THEM ON STREAM BUT THE OTHER THING YOU MENTION ABOUT IS PRIVATE LAND YOU MENTION ISSUE ABOUT HOW WE WORK WITH DEVELOPERS TO STOP HOMES BUILT ON PRIVATE LAND BEEN MARKETED OVERSEAS IT CORALIE HAPPENS IN SOME BOROUGHS AND YOU CAN'T TELL YOUR CONDITION
THAT A CONDITION OF GETTING PERMISSION IS WE SAY TO THE DEVELOPER YOU MUST MARKET FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS IN LONDON AFTER THAT YOU CAN MARKET YOU'D ORDERED THEM TO DO THAT I HAVEN'T GOT THE POWER WHAT SOME OF YOU AS A CONDITION OF THEIR PERMISSION YOU CAN HAVE SOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES DO WE WILL BE HAVING FAR MORE HOMES AVAILABLE TO LONDON SCHOOLS ARE GONNA MAKE SURE WE FIX THE RENTAL MARKET WE HAVE PLANS TO SET UP ENOUGH A PROFIT LET AGENCY AGAIN ACROSS LONDON WE'VE GOT A PLAN TO TACKLE THE HOUSING CROSS WHICH IS WHY I WOULD MAKE THE FIFTH TO BE A REFERENDUM ON THE TORY HOUSING CRISIS
FINAL QUICK THOUGHT IF DONALD TRUMP BECOMES PRESIDENT DOES IT WORRY YOU THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ALLOWED INTO THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE RELIGION IT DOES I WANT TO GO AND SPEAK TO BUILD THE GLACIER ABOUT HOW HE'S MANAGING TO HAVE A TALENT PIPELINE SPEAK TO RUN THE MANUAL ABOUT IN CHICAGO HOUSE THAT UP AN INFRASTRUCTURE BACK AND HE'S PARKS IN TEXAS THE WORK SHE'S DOING AROUND THE GREEN ENVIRONMENT AND VISIT MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN AMERICA AS WELL I'M HOPING THAT HE BEATS AND COMPREHENSIVELY BY HILLARY CLINTON SO HE CAN'T THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY PAST EIGHT IS THE TIME DIGITAL FILM MAKING IS NOW SO GOOD THAT YOU CAN CREATE ALMOST ANY WORLD SO HOW ABOUT THE REAL ONE BUT WITH ANIMALS WHO TALK THAT'S WHAT DISNEY'S NEW FILM JUNGLE BOOK TRIES TO ACHIEVE AND IT IS PRETTY REMARKABLE IS BREATHTAKING IN FACT DO YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THE ONLINE TRAILERS IF YOU GET A CHANCE ADAM VALDES IS VISUAL EFFECTS SUPERVISOR M. P. C. FILM IN LONDON AND WORKED ON THE SPECIAL EFFECTS THERE ARE OF COURSE REAL JUNGLES IN THE REAL WORLD SO I ASKED HIM WHETHER THE FILM EDITORS HAD EVEN CONSIDERED USING THEM
ONE TRICKY THING IS YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE YOUNG ACTOR AND THAT CREATES A LOT OF LOGISTICAL ISSUES OF THE CHICKS HAVE GOT ISSUES YOU HAVE HOW MANY HOURS IN A DAY THEY CAN WORK YOU HAVE DANGER OBVIOUSLY ARE SO IN THE SENSE YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE A FILM IT'S A LITTLE BIT BEYOND REALITY
WITH HEIGHTENED AND PHYSICAL PRODUCTION HAS A LOT OF LIMITS AND SO WE WANTED TO CREATE A SPECIAL WORLD AROUND MOWGLI AROUND ME ALL THE ACTOR AND AFTER A LOT OF THOUGHT WE SORT OF TOOK THE PLUNGE AND DECIDED IN AN ALL DIGITAL CREATION AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN SORT OF A UNIQUE THING ON THIS FILM IT'S
YOU LOST YOUR MIND YOU SAID YOU WON'T GET NOW DID YOU LISTEN TO ANYTHING OCULAR TALK TO THERE'S NO PLACE IN A JUNGLE FOR THESE CRACKS YOU WANT TO DO UNLESS YOU DO THIS IN A MAD READY
I THINK WE'LL GET READY FOR HIBERNATION AS DON'T HIBERNATE IN A JUNGLE
WHAT ARE YOU TEACHING HIM WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE THEN BETWEEN THE WAY YOU'VE USED THESE EFFECTS IN THIS FILM AND OTHER FILMS THAT WE HAD THE BIG DIFFERENCE ON THIS MOVIE IS IN MOST FILMS THAT YOU SEE THESE DAYS WHETHER YOU REALISE IT OR NOT THEIR SON VISUAL EFFECTS WORK SOME SORT OF DIGITAL ENHANCEMENT OF ARGUMENTATION HAPPENING AND IT TENDS TO BE THAT YOU PHOTOGRAPH MOST OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND THAT IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING
IT'S BEEN A REALLY AMBITIOUS CHOICE PROBABLY NINETY PERCENT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE IMAGE IS BEING CREATED BY ARTISTS HERE AT OUR STUDIO AND P.C. IN LONDON AND OUR SISTER'S STUDIO AND BANGALORE IN INDIA WHICH IS AN INTERESTING TIE INS WE HAVE ARTISTS IN LONDON WORKING TOGETHER ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED CRAFTSPEOPLE
THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF TECHNOLOGIES AND ARTISTRY WE'VE ALREADY DONE BUT AT A SCALE AND AN AMBITIOUS SCOPE THAT HASN'T OFTEN BEEN TEMPTED YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A STAGGERING JOB OR WORK ACTUALLY DID TO TO DO
IF YOU IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT IF YOU'VE SEEN MARTIN VIDEO GAMES AND YOU SORT OF GET A SENSE OF WORLDS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THE REPRESENTED BY THAT SORT OF GEOMETRIC SHAPES THAT YOU SEE IN THE THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY AND OUR STUDIO HERE WE'RE REALLY HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE MAKING THINGS
BY HAND IT'S ARTISTRY SO YOU CAN IMAGINE YES EVERY LEAF EVERY FLOW OF WATER EVERY YEAR MISTER STRAND OF HAIR ON THE CHARACTERS IS SOMEBODY SITTING AND CRAFTING IT MAKING IT THE SITE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT HOW IT SHOULD BE GOING THROUGH AND IT WOULD HAVE PROCESSED
IN LINE OUT HERE WHAT ARE YOU DOING SO DEEP IN THE CAMP AND IS THERE A RISK THAT PEOPLE GET TOO DAZZLED BY THE ARTISTRY AND ACTUALLY THIS DETRACTS FROM I MEAN THINK OF THE ORIGINAL JUNGLE BOOK NO MINUTES POPULARITY THAT THAT WE GET TOO HUNG UP ON THIS STUFF AND ON THE BRILLIANCE OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND YOU LOSE TRACK OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IT'S INTERESTING THIS FILM HAS HAD A BIG STORY AROUND THE VISUAL EFFECTS WHICH WE ARE OF COURSE GRATEFUL TO RECEIVE ATTENTION
BUT I WOULD SAY WE TEND TO APPROACH THEIR WORK IN SERVICE OF THE FILM AND IN THIS AND IN NOT ALL FILMS I WOULD SAY A STRAIGHT STORY IS THIS THIS IS A FILM WHICH IS A BIT OF AN EXPERIENCE
AND THE VISUAL EFFECTS TO CREATE BAD IT'S I THINK THIS WAS A TIME WHEN THIS IS POSSIBLE NOW MAYBE WASN'T POSSIBLE EVEN THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO BUT I AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK ALL OF US AT THE COMPANY AND IN OUR INDUSTRY STRIVE TO JUST NOT TAKE YOU OUT OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THE FILM I DO THAT
IN THIS CASE A LOT OF ANIMATED CHARACTERS WHICH YOU JUST NEED TO BELIEVE THAT THAT CHARACTER IS A LIVING BREATHING THING AND YOU JUST ON THE RIDE WITH THE EMOTIONS YOU DON'T WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE NOTICED IN THAT SENSE SO YES IT'S A BIT OF A BALANCING ACT ADAM BROTHERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH DON'T THANK YOU
IT IS NOW TWENTY FIVE PAST EIGHT AND HERE'S CHRIS WITH THE SPORT JOHN GOOD MORNING TO AGAIN IT'S A BUSY WEEKEND OF SPORT DOMINATED BY THE F.A. CUP SEMI FINALS AND THE LONDON MARATHON EVERTON AND MANCHESTER UNITED MEET AT WEMBLEY THIS AFTERNOON WITH BOTH MANAGERS ROBERTO MARTINEZ AND WE WENT HOME HOPING TO RESCUE THEIR SEASON AND QUITE POSSIBLY THEIR JOB BY SECURING THEIR PLACE IN THE CUP FINAL THE WINNERS WILL MEET THE CRYSTAL PALACE OR WATFORD WHO PLAY ON SUNDAY

ITEM CHRIS DENNIS FROM B.B.C. RADIO HERE WE ALL KNOW THE REFUELLING TAKING ONBOARD LIQUID POSSIBLY FOOD DURING A MARATHON IS SO IMPORTANT HOW ON EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ON FUEL ON BOARD ON SUNDAY
THAT'S GOOD POINT CHRIS I'VE GOT A FEW ENERGY GELS I SENT UP AND I'LL BE TAKING THOSE AND OF COURSE I'LL HAVE PLENTY OF THESE THINGS WHICH I'M GOING TO VELCRO NEXT TO ME JUST DRINKING WATER POUCHES OUT OF A STRAW IT'S ALL THAT WILL HELP ME KEEP ME GOING THROUGHOUT THE RACE
THEY'RE SPEAKING TO ME FROM OUTER SPACE LET'S SPEAK TO SOMEBODY ON TERRA FIRMA BRENDAN FOSTER WHO'LL BE COMMENTATING ON HIS THIRTY SIX LONDON MARATHON TOMORROW MORNING MORNING TO YOU BRENDAN GOOD MORNING CHRIS NOW WHEN YOU'RE WINNING OLYMPIC MEDALS WAY BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES COULD YOU HAVE A DAY WHEN SOMEBODY WOULD BE RUNNING A MARATHON FROM OUTER SPACE
I CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'VE JUST HEARD I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE IN MANY MANY PLACES ALL AROUND THE WORLD BUT I WILL NEVER GOING OUTSIDE THE WORLD IN THE OUTER SPACE THEY'VE ANOTHER COMPOSER HAVE A GOOD LOOK GOOD LOOK AT THE SPACE ABSOLUTELY ONE MILLION FINISHES THEN IN THE LONDON MARATHON AT SOME POINT TOMORROW MASS PARTICIPATION ROAD RUNNING BRENDAN SEEMS TO BE IN FANTASTIC HEALTH WHY WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S MAINTAINED ITS POPULARITY
WELL I MEAN IT'S FOR EVERYONE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IS NOT JUST THE MARATHON IN LONDON IT'S HALF MARATHONS OR ON THE COUNTRY AS TEN CASE FOR EXAMPLE THE NEW OLYMPIC PARK IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME SO SO IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THERE FOR EVERYONE IT'S A TENABLE DISTANCE BUT THE MARATHON THE LONDON MARATHON IN PARTICULAR IS A ONE OF PEOPLE DREAM OF THEY WATCH IT ON T.V. AND THEY SAY I CAN DO THAT WHEN THEY SEE ORDINARY PEOPLE
DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS THAT IS THE MOTIVATION FOR EVERYONE TO GET UP AND LET ME BE PART OF IT QUARTER OF A MILLION APPLICATIONS FOR THEM FOR THEIR PLACES TOMORROW IT'S IT'S IN RUDE HEALTH IT IS INDEED AND YET BY CONTRAST ELITE ATHLETICS LET'S BE HONEST THROUGH THE RECENT DOPING SCANDALS AS ARGUABLY NEVER BEEN IN A BIGGER MESS HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS APPARENT PARADOX
THE PROFESSIONAL SPORT OF OF ATHLETICS IS GOVERNED BY THE IDEAL BLAIR FOR OVER THERE OVER THE YEARS HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES ARE NOT RELIABLE AND AT THE VERY LEAST
ORGANISATION AND THE DOPING SCANDALS THAT HAVE GONE ROUND THE WORLD HAVE NOT BEEN AS POKE POLICED AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HOWEVER ATHLETICS IS AT THE VANGUARD OF CHANGING THESE THINGS IT'S TRYING VERY HARD BUT IT'S HAD A REALLY BAD TIME IN THE CREDIBILITY OF THE SPORT IS CERTAINLY IN QUESTION AND THAT IS A SIT FOR ME THAT'S A DIFFERENT SPORT THAT'S THE RIGHT PROFESSIONAL SPORT
I THINK IT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU'VE GOT THE SPORT OF PEOPLE ATTAINING AND TRYING TO ATTAIN THEIR DREAMS AND THEIR AMBITIONS AND TRYING TO DO WHAT WHAT IS IS HUMANLY VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO RUN A MARATHON OR EVEN A HALF MARATHON BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SPORT OF RUNNING

THANK YOU BOTH YOU'RE LISTENING TODAY ARE RADIO FOR JOHN HUNDRED JUSTIN WEBB THE TIME IS HALF PAST EIGHT AND CORACLE FEELS OVER THE SUMMER THE LEAVES PRESIDENT OBAMA IS BEGINNING THE SECOND FULL DAY OF HIS VISIT TO BRITAIN WITH CONTROVERSY STILL RAGING OVER HIS INTERVENTION IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN HIS CLAIM THAT BRITAIN OUTSIDE THE E.U. WOULD BE AT THE BACK OF THE QUEUE FOR A TRADE DEAL WITH THE U.S. HAS BEEN DISMISSED BY THOSE CAMPAIGNING FOR A BRITISH EXIT
N.H.S. ENGLAND SAYS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE LATEST STRIKE ACTION BY JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THEIR DISPUTE ABOUT A NEW CONTRACT ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY JUNIOR DOCTORS DUE TO STAGE THE FIRST FULL WALK OUT IN THE HISTORY OF THE N.H.S. WHICH WILL INCLUDE THOSE WORKING IN EMERGENCY CARE
THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL IS TRAVELLING TO TURKEY TO PROMOTE A DEAL REACH LAST MONTH TO MANAGE THE MIGRANT CRISIS TOGETHER WITH THE E.U. PRESIDENT DONALD TO ARE SCANNED BY VICE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FRANZ TIMMERMAN SHE'LL VISIT GIRLS YOU ANT OUT OF TOWN ON THE BORDER WITH SYRIA
THE BRITISH ASTRONAUT TIM PEAKE IS PREPARING TO TAKE PART IN TOMORROW'S LONDON MARATHON FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES ABOVE THE CITY STREETS MAJOR PEAK WILL RUN THE COURSE ON A TREADMILL
THANK YOU IT IS A TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE WELL THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA STRUCK HIS BIGGEST BLOW AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE CAMPAIGNING FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE SUBJECT WAS TRADE A PRACTICAL THING MATTERS OF COURSE IT AFFECTS OUR JOBS OUR WEALTH AND LIVELIHOODS THE QUESTION WAS COULD WE TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES IN THE FUTURE JUST US OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH FAVOURED TREATMENT WITH A DEAL THAT ALLOWED FREE TRADE AND THE PRESIDENT WAS PRETTY CLEAR I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT
MAYBE SOME POINT DOWN THE LINE THERE MIGHT BE
U.K. U.S. TRADING ROOM BUT IT'S LIKE THEY WERE HER BEDTIME SOON BECAUSE OUR FOCUSES IN NEGOTIATING WERE THEY BIG BLOCK OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO GET A TRADE AGREEMENT
O.K. HE'S GOING TO BE IN THE BACK OF THE QUEUE JOHN SOBEL A NORTH AMERICAN HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT ON THIS TRIP INDEED ARRIVED WITH HIM ON AIRFORCE ONE AND IS WITH US IN THE STUDIO AND EVEN HAS HIS WHITE HOUSE PRESS PARSON DANGLING ONE INCH I OWN WITH THAT PRESS PASS IN MIND THEN WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND TO THIS TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO BE AS TOUGH
AS HE WAS AND DID HE DO IT IN CAHOOTS WITH DOWNING STREET DID YOU DO IT JUST BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IT OR Y. OH KAY LET'S TRY AND DECONSTRUCT IT BUT WHEN I INTERVIEWED HIM LAST SUMMER HE WAS PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT
THE NEED FOR BRITAIN TO REMAIN INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK ANOTHER PART OF THAT IS THAT THERE IS A SORT OF MAYBE DEMOB HAPPY IS NOT THE RIGHT PHRASE BUT I THINK THEY HAVE THE Y. HAS SAID TO ME THAT WE HAVE USED A VERY
CAREFULLY CALIBRATED NUANCED PHRASES IN THE PAST AND THEY'VE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD WHY DON'T WE JUST SPEAK CLEARLY NOW AND IN SAUDI ARABIA HE'S BUT KING SALMAN AND SAID I DON'T LIKE YOUR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD AND YOU'VE GOT TO STOP THE WEIGHT OF EXECUTIONS AND I THINK HE HAD PLANNED QUITE DELIBERATELY TO BE AS FORTHRIGHT WHEN HE CAME TO BRITAIN AND I THINK THEY HAD CALCULATED THAT THERE WOULD BE PUSHED BACK FROM THE BRECHT'S IT PEOPLE WHO WOULD TAKE EXCEPTION TO THE LANGUAGE HE USED MOST INTERESTINGLY
LAST NIGHT I PICKED UP A SENSE OF SOME UNEASE ABOUT THAT BACK OF THE QUEUE PHRASE
ONE SENIOR WHITE HOUSE PERSON SAID HE WINCED WHEN HE HEARD THE PRESIDENT USE IT IT HADN'T BEEN PART OF THE SCRIPT WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE OF COURSE IN AMERICA SAY THE BACK OF THE LARDER IT'S A KIND OF AND SO I HEARD IT OR BACK AT THE KILL
I'VE BEEN LEARNING AMERICAN FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO THAT I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT A RESTROOM RATHER THAN GOING TO A TOILET AND YOU SAY WHERE'S THE LINE YOU DON'T SAY WHERE IS THE QUEUE AND I SO THAT WAS THAT WAS SLIGHTLY ODD BUT APPARENTLY I'VE HEARD IT FROM THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT SAUCES THAT HAD NOT BEEN PART OF THE SCRIPT OF WHAT HE WOULD SAY THE IDEA WOULD HE WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT AND HE WOULD AMPLIFY THE ARTICLE THAT HAD BEEN
IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH BUT HE WOULDN'T GO QUITE AS FAR AS HE DID AND I'M A SUBSTANCE OF IT IN BRITAIN AMERICA MAKES TRADE DEALS WITH TENNIS AND THE POINT HE WAS MAKING IT TENDS TO LIKE TO MAKE TRADE DEALS WITH BIG BLOCKS AND THAT'S TRUE ISN'T IT BUT OF COURSE HE WON'T BE AROUND TO EITHER MAKE A TRADE DEAL OR UNMAKE A TRADE IN THE SIEGE
YES AND THE THING IS THOUGH THAT I MEAN YEAR WHEN PEOPLE COME TO OFFICE THE DIFFERENCE IN FOREIGN POLICY AND TRADE POLICY DOESN'T VARY HUGELY BETWEEN PEOPLE BY AND LARGE BUY IN TO SEE IF YOU LOOK AT NAFTA I MEAN THEY WERE POLITICAL EXCEPTIONS TO IT
BUT IT HAS REMAINED IN PLACE YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH YOU GET IT DURING THE CAMPAIGN A LOT OF RHETORIC SAY ON DAY ONE I AM GOING TO COME INTO HER OFFICE AND I'M GOING TO RIP UP X. OR HER CONDOR LEEZA RICE ANYTHING RECENTLY SAY THE ONE THING YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT ON DAY ONE THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND WISER HEADS WILL PREVAIL THEY'LL TAKE COUNSEL AND THEY WON'T DO THOSE SORT OF THINGS SO YES HE MAY BE A LAME DUCK BUT LOOK POLICY IS GOING TO CONTINUE ON CERTAIN THINGS
AND IT'S ALSO RIGHT THE AMERICA FOLK AMERICAN FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AND ALSO THE EUROPEAN DEAL AND WHERE WOULD BRITAIN BE IF IT'S OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK AND YOUR FINAL PUT I THINK BARACK OBAMA SAID IT NOT TO HELP DAVID CAMERON I THINK THAT WAS COINCIDENTAL TO IT I THINK HE SAID IT BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IN THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT WHETHER IT'S ECONOMIC
POLITICAL OR ABSOLUTELY KIND OF OF THE VIEW THAT BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN THE E.U. YEAH O.K. JOHN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR TRIP LET'S TURN NOW TO SIR ANDREW CALM IS A FORMER HEAD OF YOU KATIE A U.K. TRADE AND INVESTMENT AND ALSO ON THE LINE LORD OWEN FORMER LABOUR FOREIGN SECRETARY OF COURSE MEMBER OF VOTE LEAVE MORNING SHE BOTH DICK CAN WE JUST START SIR ANDREW WITH A KIND OF FAT
BASIS OF THIS AT THE MOMENT WE DID QUITE A GOOD TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES THEN WE SELL A LOT PARTICULARLY THINK OF CARS OR AMERICANS WEALTHY AMERICANS DRIVE JAGUARS IN LANDROVERS ET-CETERA AT THE MOMENT WHAT WHAT IS THE TERMS OF THAT TRADE AND WE HAD TO PAY TERRACE WHAT GOES ON ALL THE ROLF PARIS OF COURSE WITH AMERICA BUT THE TERMS ARE LIKE WITH ANY OTHER A THIRD COUNTRY COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE HAVE MOST FAVOURED ME YES THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT AND WE WOULD WE COULD GO ON DOING THAT OF COURSE WE COULD GO ON TRADING WITH AMERICA BUT WE MUST PUT IMPORTANT POINT ISN'T IT AT THE MOMENT WE DO A GOOD TRADE AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY WELL FOR US AND WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE A SITUATION THAT WAS WORSE THAN THAT IF WE WERE OUTSIDE THE OPINION WE WOULDN'T HAVE A SITUATION WAS WORSE BUT IF WE STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
WE CAN HOPE TO BE PART OF THE E. U. U. S. STEAL THE SO CALLED TEACHER THE TRANSIT TRADE AND INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP THAT IS ESTIMATED TO ADD ABOUT TEN BILLION A YEAR TO OUR P. SO HE'D BEEN MISSING OUT ON SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY VALUABLE IF WE'RE IF WE LEAVE LORD ERNE MISSING OUT
THE MOMENT OF COURSE IT IS IN BIG TROUBLE PARTICULARLY WITH GERMANY AND AUSTRIA AND NOW INCREASINGLY IN BRITAIN BECAUSE OF THE INCLUSION OF THE HEALTH CLAUSE SO THAT T. T. I P. IS NOT GOING TO BE AGREED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA IT'S ALSO BEEN CRITICISED BY ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES NAMELY THEY'RE FOCUSING OF COURSE
THE PACIFIC ONE THAT'S IF YOU LIKE FIRST IN THE QUEUE OR AS MY AMERICAN WIFE WOULD SAY FIRST OF THE LINE I THINK YOU'VE GOT A FACE HERE THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN CRAFTED IN NUMBER TEN BY CAMERON ALSO BY THE CHANCELLOR EXCHEQUER IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT ABOUT IT IS REASONABLE TO DO SO BUT I THINK HE'S MUCH MORE WORRYING ASPECT OF THE CRAFTY INNINGS ARTICLE IN THE TELEGRAPH HE MUST BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT
EVER SINCE LIKE NATO WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE TO TALK ABOUT PEACE BEING DONE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE Y. YOU USE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT PIECE IT'S ALL TO DO WITH NATURE AND THAT WAS A REAL GIVEAWAY THAT THAT HE'S NOT SPEAKING FOR THE HEART THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY STRONG ON KEEPING NATO DEFENCE I'M NOT DEFENCE SO I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A DEEPER REASON WHY IS HE DOING IT
THIS MAN HAS LIVED FOR SEVEN YEARS TRYING TO PERSUADE THE AND THE EUROPEAN UNION TO CHANGE RADICALLY OF THE FLOORS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE EUROZONE HE'S DEAD WORRIED ABOUT A YEAR AS COLLAPSE AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO LEAVE I THINK POINT ISN'T IT SIR AND WOULD ACTUALLY AND IT IS BUT IT COULD ALSO BE A REASON WHY HE MIGHT WANT TO REMAIN THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ACTUALLY SAYING LOOK AT THE STATE OF EUROPE WERE YOU TO LEAVE IT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE A EUROPE WITHOUT
BRITAIN IN AND THAT IS QUITE TELLING ISN'T WELL I DISAGREE PROFOUNDLY FIRST OF ALL WITH LORD IRVINE SAYING THAT PEACE HAS BEEN KEPT IN EUROPE ONLY BY NATO THE FACT THAT THE EUROPEAN NATIONS IN THE OLD ENEMIES OF FRANCE AND GERMANY HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER FOR SIXTY YEARS IS I THINK A MUCH LARGER REASON NATO HAS PROTECTED US AGAINST RUSSIA AND OTHER EXTERNAL ENEMIES THE E.U. HAS PROTECTED US AGAINST US FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER
SO SO I I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AT ALL BUT I AGREE WITH YOU OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT OBAMA DOES WANT BRITAIN TO EXERCISE ITS INFLUENCE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WE HAVE BEEN AND IT'S A BAD ASS AS WELL WE HAVE WON SO MUCH OF THE SINGLE MARKET THAT WAS BRITAIN ENLARGEMENT TO THE EAST BRINGING ALL THE COUNTRIES SENT TO EUROPE INTO THE EUROPEAN THAT WAS US MAKING EUROPE A MUCH MORE LIBERAL PLACE THAN IT WAS WHEN FRANCE WITH DOMINATED IT
THAT WAS US AND I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA LOOKS AND SAYS WELL I WANT BRITAIN'S LIBERALISING OPEN FREE TRADING AND POLITICAL WISDOM IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AS WELL WHAT YOU WHAT AN IMPORTANT COUNTRY OUTSIDE
WELL THE SINGLE MARKET HAS BEEN HELPFUL AND THAT WAS ESTABLISHED OF COURSE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE EURO AND PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO GET IT INTO THEIR HURTS THERE ARE
TWO PHASES OF EUROPE FROM NINETEEN FIFTY SIX TO NINETEEN NINETY TWO IT WAS BROADLY SUCCESSFUL THE GREAT ERROR AND THERE WEREN'T THING WE ARE LIVING WITH NOW AND IT'S DRAGGING EUROPE MAKING IT DYSFUNCTIONAL WAS NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE CREATION OF A CURRENCY WITHOUT A COUNTRY NOWHERE IN THE WORLD HAS IT BEEN POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH A CURRENCY WITHOUT A COUNTRY AND THIS EXPERIMENT HAS FAILED AND IBAMA WANTS US TO HELP GOVERNMENT
ALL WE HAVE THE AS WELL WE'VE TRIED LOOK FOR SEVEN YEARS DURING THE WORLD GLOBAL CRISIS RECOVERY WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THE EUROZONE BACK ON TRACK AND WE'VE TRIED IN BRITAIN AND FAILED AND AMERICA'S FAILED AND I ASK MYSELF WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF BRITAIN NONE OF THIS MANDARIN STUFF WHAT IS
GOING TO HELP BRITAIN AND BRITAIN NEEDS TO CREATE NEW MARKETS AWAY FROM THE MORE GLOBAL APPROACH SO WE ARE NOT CROAK IT HIT BY THIS CRISIS WILL BE FAR HARDER HIT THAN AMERICA BY CRISIS AND PREVENTION THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP AS A NEUROSCIENTIST TO DO PREVENT THINGS ALL RIGHT AND WE CAN HELP PREVENT IT BY GETTING OUT'S A CHAR LET'S LET'S PUT THAT AS A ROUND OR WE CAN LEAVE THE SHIP BEFORE IT SINKS
WELL WE DO MUCH BETTER TO BE WITH IN THE SINK IN THE SHIP STOPPING AT SINKING I THINK MANDARINS WILL NOT IF WE MALE TO STOP IT WELL BUT WE HAVE THE BEST OF ALL WORLDS AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE WE ARE BOTH STILL ON HER SIDE KING THERE YOU'RE INTERESTING YOU'RE NOT SAYING IT'S NOT SINK I DON'T I THINK EUROPE IS SINKING I THINK YOUR OPINION WILL BE WITH US FOR DECADES TO COME WHO CAN LOOK BEYOND DECADE
AND I THINK IT WILL GET OVER THE EUROZONE CRISIS THOUGH I AGREE IT'S A VERY SERIOUS ONE I AGREE THAT THE CREATION OF THE EURO WAS A WAS A HISTORIC MISTAKEN THAT IS PART OF THE CAUSE OF OUR PROBLEMS BUT BRITAIN WE WE CANNOT ESCAPE PUT OUR HEAD IN THE SAND IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE KING CANUTE SAYING KEEP AWAY FROM US WILL STOP THE TIDE COMING IN
MY MY BELIEF IS THAT WE NEED TO BE IN THERE IN A REGION LEADING IT REFORMING IT CHANGING IT THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD TURN AWAY TO SOME ILLUSORY LAND WHICH WE CAN DOMINATE IT'S JUST A FANTASY WE GOT A LIVER THERE SIR ANDREW LORD ERNE AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS OF THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE ELECTION OF A NEW LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS APPEARS TO BE GROWING THE GUARDIAN REPORTED THAT STUDENT UNIONS AT A STRING OF UNIVERSITIES INCLUDING OXFORD AND YORK ARE CONSIDERING CUTTING THEIR TIES WITH THE NATIONAL BODY IN PROTEST AT PAST CONDEMNATION CONDOR NATIONS OF ZIONISM MADE BY MUDDY ABOOT SHE'S REJECTED CLAIMS OF ANTI CEMETERIES AND INSISTED SHE OPPOSES ALL FORMS OF RACISM THE TIMES OBSERVES THAT THE ELECTION OF THE N.U.S. IS FIRST BLACK
FEMALE MUSLIM PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WELCOMED AS A STEP FORWARD FOR DIVERSITY INSTEAD IT HAS GENERATED UNPRECEDENTED DISCORD THE TELEGRAPH HAS NEWS THAT A MINISTER HIS CALL FOR MORE PROTECTION OF HISTORIC VIEWS AS ANGERED FELLOW VILLAGERS BY BUILDING A SIXTY TWO FOOT SWIMMING POOL COMPLEX NEXT TO A PICTURESQUE FIFTEENTH CENTURY CHURCH
RESIDENTS OF WINDS COME AND SOMERSET SAY THE METAL ROOFED BUILDING IN THE GARDEN OF JOHN PENROSE IS GRADE TWO LISTED HOUSES HIDEOUS AND MASSIVE SPOILS THE VIEW FROM A SCENIC FOOTPATH RUNNING THROUGH THE MENDIP HILLS MISTER PENROSE AND HIS WIFE DIDI HARDING WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF TALKTALK HAD PROMISED THAT THE POOL WOULD NOT BE CLEARLY VISIBLE
IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT MARRIAGE IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH BUT THE TIMES REPORTS THAT RESEARCHERS IN ITALY ARE FOUND AT WIDOWHOOD CAN BE HEALTHIER THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT WOMEN WHO LOSE A SPOUSE ARE LESS LIKELY TO SUFFER FRAILTY IN THEIR LATER YEARS AND HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCE LESS STRESS WITHOUT ONE HUSBAND AROUND BUT THE SAME IS NOT THE CASE FOR MEN THEY BECOME MORE AT RISK OF WASTING AWAY ONCE THEIR WIVES ARE NO LONGER AROUND TO LOOK AFTER THEM
THE TIME IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WHAT IS A TYPICAL JIHADIS THAT'S THE QUESTION WE'VE BEEN ADDRESSING ONE WITH ALL THE OTHER EVER SINCE THE WORD ENTERED ALBERT CADBURY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO AND THE ANSWER
WELL THE THINK TANK THE CENTRE FOR RELIGION AND GEOPOLITICS HAS PRODUCED A STUDY THAT SAYS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A TYPICAL JIHADIST I'M JOINED BY ALBERT BADAWI WHO IS THE REPORT'S AUTHOR SENIOR ANALYST AT THE CENTRE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND YOU'VE LOOKED AT ONE HUNDRED OF THE MOST HIGH PROFILE JIHAD IS FOR WANT OF A BETTER WORD TO ANALYSE WHO THEY WERE AND WHERE THEY COME FROM WHAT DID THEY HAD IF ANYTHING IN COMMON
WELL THEY CERTAINLY WORDS THERE WAS CERTAINLY WASN'T A TYPICAL JIHAD IN THE SAMPLE AND WE EXPECTED THAT TO BE THE CASE BUT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IT WAS TRIED TO USE A FORENSIC APPROACH LOOKING AT THEIR LIVES BEFORE ENGAGEMENT TO HAD AN UNDERSTANDING THE PROGRESSION INTO HAD AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY FOUND WAS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS AROUND WHAT ATTRACTED YOU HATTIE
BUT ACTUALLY TO HARDY'S ARE NOT NECESSARILY UNDER EDUCATED FOR ONE SO BY LOOKING AT THE DATA ON THEIR EDUCATION BACKGROUND ACTUALLY THEY'RE VERY WELL EDUCATED IN FACT MORE THAN HALF OF OUR AD TO HARDY'S HAD ACTUALLY ENGAGED WITH UNIVERSITY DEGREES BUT WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING WAS WHEN YOU LOOKED AT WHAT THEY STUDIED FOR INSTANCE AND ACTUALLY THERE WAS A HUGE UNDER REPRESENTATION OF ISLAMIC STUDIES
THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE TO BE HONEST MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS AND THINK WELL THESE GUYS ARE APPLYING ISLAMIC THEOLOGY QUITE WILLINGLY AND THEY WERE PLAYING SHARIA LAW IN THEIR TERRITORIES AND YET THERE'S A REAL UNDER REPRESENTATION OF ANY FORMAL EDUCATION ISLAMIC STAR SO WHERE DID THEY COME OR HOW DID THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH ISLAM AND
ALL THESE WHAT WE LOOKED AT MIDDLE EASTERN AFRICA TO HATTIE'S AND AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY AS A MUSLIM TO BE ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN THE IDEOLOGY THAT SAD IF IT ADDED THEM AND PROMOTES AND THEY COME FROM WITHIN OAP LARGELY ISLAMIC CULTURE BUT IT'S HOW THEY APPLY THAT THAT THE IDEOLOGY BUT IT'S NOT JUST EDUCATION IF FOUND WE ALSO FOUND THINGS LIKE CRIMINALITY THIS IS A BIG MISCONCEPTION ARDOUR HAD HE'S PREDISPOSED TO LAWLESSNESS
WELL MOST OF OUR JIHAD IS ACTUALLY HAD SPENT TIME IN PRISON DURING A A CAREER FOR DOING THINGS UNRELATED TO JIHAD IS A MONEY FOR JUST BEING BAD PEOPLE THE MAJORITY HAD JUST SPENT TIME IN BETTER HAD A CAREER IN PRISON BUT A TINY MINORITY HAD ACTUALLY DONE ANY CRIMINALITY I HAD ANY CRIMINALITY INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES BEFORE ENGAGING MY HAT DIDN'T SORRY THAT'S KEY BECAUSE STAMP SHOWS THAT THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY
CRIMINALS BEFORE THEY'D JOINED HAT BUT THEY'RE ACTUAL TIME HE SPENT IN PRISON
IT WAS DAD COMING OUT DICK DID WERE THERE ANY COMMON CHARACTERISTICS AS FAR AS THEIR PERSONALITIES WERE CONCERNED WERE THEY ALL A PRONE TO EXTREMISM IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
THIS IS A BIG QUESTION ABOUT PRAYING TO EXTREMISM IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THIS AND THERE WAS NO DAYTIME ON PERSONALITIES THERE'S NO PSYCHIC METRIC SCALE BUT WHAT WE DO LOOK AT IS THE SORT OF EXPERIENCES IN THE ENVIRONMENTS THEY WERE THEY WERE THEY WERE IN AND PRISONS ARE ONE PRISONS MAY NOT HAVE AT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CRIMINALITY RITUALS THEM INTO EXTREMISM BUT ACTUALLY SPENDING TIME IN PRISON WE FOUND
ACTUALLY BUILT UP PERSONAL NETWORKS FOR THEM AND THAT WAS REALLY NICE AND THAT'S WHERE THE BENEFIT OF GOING THROUGH A FORENSIC APPROACH DOES BECAUSE WHAT YOU CAN SEE IF YOU CAN SEE THE PERSONAL CONTACTS IN THE RELATIONSHIPS NOT JUST FOCUSING ON THE GRAPES WHICH IS WHAT WE OFTEN DO WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH THE JIHADI THREAT IS WE LOOK AT ISIS WE LOOK AT AL SHABAB WE LOOK AT BUCK HER UP BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THESE GROUPS ARE MADE UP OF PEOPLE AND THESE PEOPLE DRIVE THE IDEOLOGY THEY INFLUENCE EACH OTHER AND THAT'S REALLY KIT FOR INSTANCE WE FOUND A STRONG LINK BETWEEN NON VIOLENT EXTREMISM
AND EXTREMISTS AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM FOR INSTANCE MOST OF OUTER HAD HE'S HAD ACTUALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND WORRYING FACT RECRUITED FROM WITHIN NON VIOLENT ORGANISATION IT'S WELL THAT'S INTERESTING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED EMMA BUT I'LL BE THANK YOU HIM AND OWL
EMEN HE'LL BADAWI THANK I THINK YOU THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WHAT'S GONE WRONG AND ASTON VILLA BIRMINGHAM'S BIGGEST FOOTBALL CLUB WITH A PROUD HISTORY IN A TRADITION STRETCHING RIGHT BACK TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AS ALREADY BEEN RELEGATED FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE THIS AFTERNOON AT THEIR HOME MATCH WHICH IS AGAINST SOUTHAMPTON
THEY'LL BE ORGANISED PROTESTS APPARENTLY FROM FANCY FOUND A LIST OF GRIEVANCES AND ABSENTEE OWNER MISMANAGEMENT AT A SENIOR LEVEL ANY THIS WEEK TWO TWO RESIGNATIONS FROM TWO HIGH PROFILE DIRECTORS HAD BARELY HAD THEIR FEET UNDER THE BOARDROOM TABLE YOU CAN ADD TO THAT THE STORY OF A PLAYER
WHO JUST REFUSED TO PLAY ROB BONNET REPORTS NOW FROM THE CENTRE OF BIRMINGHAM
WELL IT'S HARDLY A SCIENTIFIC SAMPLE BUT THIRTY MINUTES IN BIRMINGHAM CITY CENTRE AND VILLA FANS ARE HARD TO FIND POM WITH LIVERPOOL SEASON TICKET HOLDER MADE GLASGOW RANGERS OR NOT SO I DON'T THINK ABOUT THE VILLA WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO
OTHER SOFA FOR A LOT ARE YOU ARE YOU MUST BE PLEASED I AM THAT ONE LOCAL BIRMINGHAM CITY FAN AT LEAST THEY'RE BACK IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES SURELY THE BULLRING WOULD HAVE BEEN THRONGING WITH VILLA SUPPORTERS
CLUB WHAT LEAGUE CHAMPIONS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS IN EIGHTY TWO YOU'RE NOW PICKED UP A TACKLE BY BORN IN BY THE PROBABLY I'M ONLY ONE MADE ON THE OTHER
AND EVOLVED IN THAT COMMENTARY GARY SHAW A BRIGHT ENERGETIC SCORER OF GOALS BUT ALSO A VILLA FAN FROM A VERY EARLY AGE HE WORE THE SHIRT OF THE CLUB
ABSOLUTELY IT WAS THE SECOND BIGGEST CITY TO PLAY FOR ASTON VILLA FOR ME IT WAS A GREAT HONOUR AND TO THEM PROBABLY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE WHEN I STARTED IN THAT THAT WAS A FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT AND A JOY TO EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW HE'S A LOCAL BUILDER
NOW THE REMAINING FOR HANDS LONG SUFFERING AND LOYAL ARE ANGRY ABOUT WHAT SOME SEE AS A COULDN'T CARE LESS ATTITUDE FROM THE PLAYERS THE LATEST INSTANT BEING WHAT AMOUNTED TO A STRIKE BY DEFENDER JOHN IS A CORY EARLIER THIS MONTH AND BEFORE VILLAS RELEGATION A CORI TOLD CARETAKER MANAGER ERIC BLACK THAT HE WOULDN'T PLAY AS A SUBSTITUTE AGAINST BALL
SO BLACK OMITTED HIM GAVE HIM THE WEEKEND TO THINK ABOUT IT AND SPOKE TO HIM ON THE FOLLOWING MUG NO POINT HE CONFRONT HE STANDS AND ALSO CONFRONTED AND WANT TO PLAY AGAIN FOR ASTON VILLAIN
AND AT THAT POINT I SAID OR YOU CAN TRIM THEM THAT TWENTY ONES WITH US THIS IS I'M NOT HAVIN THAT ATTITUDE IN THE GROUP AND HE'S NOT DOING IT I'M NOT PREPARED TO WALK WITH ATTITUDE IN THE GRIT AND EARLIER THIS WEEK THERE'S BEEN THIS B.B.C. W.M. NINETY FIVE
IN VILLAS SAY CHAIRMAN STEVE HOLLIS IS IN NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE SALE OF THE CLUB IT'S ALSO BEEN ANNOUNCED THIS AFTERNOON THE DIRECTORS DAVID BYRNE AND MERVYN KING HAVE RESIGNED FROM THE BOARD WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT IT ALL EVERY F.A. CHAIRMAN BERNSTEIN SAID HIS POSITION HAD BECOME UNTENABLE LORD KING FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAD SAID MUCH THE SAME
HEAVY HITTERS BOTH THEY'D FALLEN OUT WITH THE AMERICAN CLUB OWNER RANDY LERNER WHO'S TEN YEARS IN CHARGE OF BEING CHARACTERISED MOSTLY BY HIS TRANSATLANTIC ABS
KING SPOKE TO BLOOMBERG T.V. I'VE BEEN WATCHING ASTON VILLA FOR OVER FIFTY FIVE YEARS MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION EXPLAINED EXACTLY WHY I STOOD DOWN ALONG WITH DAVID BERNSTEIN
BOTH OF US VERY MUCH HOPE THAT THE EVENTS OF THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL PUT VILLA BACK ON TRACK AND SO FROM THE CITY CENTRE TO THEIR SUBURBAN HOME OF THE FORMER CHAIRMAN SIR DOUG ELLIS WHO SOLD THE CLUB TO RANDY LERNER WHO NOW WANTS TO SELL THE CLUB HIMSELF
WHAT ADVICE MIGHT HE HAVE GIVEN TO THE AMERICAN WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER GIVING MORE TIME MORE TIME IN THE U.K. BUT HE'S A NICE GUY AND HE HASN'T COME AS OFTEN AS I'D HAVE LIKED HIM TO
DO YOU REGRET SELLING TO RANDY LERNER NOT REALLY DEL WHY NOT I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD HAVE SOLD IT TO ANY BETTER PERSON HE SAID HE'D PUT TWO HUNDRED BILLION END AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HE DID PUT TWO HUNDRED AND SO HE'S KEPT HIS WORD
SO DON'T BELIEVES THAT THE PURCHASE OF A COUPLE OF EXPERIENCED DEFENDERS MIGHT HAVE SAY VILLA BUT FOR MORE DETAIL ON WHAT WENT WRONG HERE'S CIARAN MCGUIRE FOOTBALL FINANCE SPECIALIST AT LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY THE ULTIMATE DECISION MAKING RESTS WITH RANDY LERNER
I THINK THE BIG MISTAKES HE'S MADE HE'S NOT APPOINTING A BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHO HAVE THE RIGHT SKILL SET TO RUN VILLA AS A BUSINESS BOTH STRATEGICALLY SORT OF IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM BUT ALSO ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS IN TERMS OF CHOOSING THE CLUB MANAGER AND MAKING THE RIGHT RECRUITMENT DECISIONS THEY SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY LAST SUMMER ON A BUNCH OF PLAYERS THAT NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE HEARD OF IT WE CERTAINLY HAVE NOT DELIVERED ON THE FIELD OF PLAY AND THEY SOLD THE TWO BEST PLAYERS INVENTOR HEY UM DEALT AND THAT'S A GENERALLY HELD VIEW AS WE RETURN TO FINALLY TO GARY SHAW AND THE
SELF DEPRECATING COVERS HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS IT'S SHAMBOLIC IT'S EMBARRASSING EVERYTHING IT'S ALL NEGATIVITY COMING HEAD THAN THEY MET TIMES OFFERED FROM VILLA FANCY
PUT YOUR BOOTS BACK I KNOW IT'S HULK IT CAN GROWTH ON INPUT THIS ON THERE LET ALONE THE BOATS BUT IT'S ALL BEEN NEGATIVITY FOR ASTON VILLA AND THE FANS MUST BE SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND GO WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
ROB BONNET ON THE STREETS OF BIRMINGHAM FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO TODAY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE WAS BORN AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE REST AS HE ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN HIS HISTORY SO WHAT WOULD HE HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THE IMPACT HE HAS HAD ON HER SINCE WE CAN'T ASK HIM LET'S ASK A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIS WORK AS WELL AS ANYONE GREAT DAWN AS THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE COMPANY DAVID TELLING HIM HE'S THE ACTOR
AND HOST OF SHAKESPEARE LIVE TONIGHT DEBBIE JUST TELL US A BIT ABOUT SHAKESPEARE LIVE TONIGHT MORNING WELL IT'S ON YOUR TELLY IT THIRTEEN B. B. C. TWO TONIGHT AND IT'S LIVE FROM THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE THEATRE IN INSTRUCTOR WHAT EVEN AND IT'S GOT
SORT OF THE GREAT AND THE GOOD OF SHAKESPEARE LAND JUDI DENCH IAN MCKELLEN RORY KINNEAR BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH HELEN MIRREN DAVID SUE ALL OF THEM REALLY THEY'RE ALL UP AND THEN WE HAVE
IT'S FROM OPERA THAT SHAKESPEARE'S INFLUENCE FROM BALLY THAT SHE'D RISEN WE HAVE RUFUS WAINWRIGHT GETTING A SORT OF MODERN TAKE ON A SHAKESPEAREAN SONNET
AND MENTIONS DOING SOME FUNNY BUT IT'S A SORT OF A KIND OF VARIETY BILL OF SHAKESPEARE AND HIS LEGACY THE THOUGHT OF VARIETY BUT QUITE WORK AT THE COVERLET DELIVERED I KNOW TONIGHT JOIN NO I DON'T I DON'T EXACTLY HUMID GREG SHAKESPEARE CHILDREN AN AWFUL LOT OF THEM I DARE TO VENTURE OF MOST OF THEM HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE WHEN THEY READ A SHAKESPEARE PLAY WHICH THEY ARE FORCED TO DO IN SCHOOL AN AWFUL LOT OF THEM WHAT THEY MEAN FAIR COMMENT
YOU KNOW I THINK HE WROTE THE PLAYS FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND THERE IS A DENSITY OF LANGUAGE IT IS I THINK THE REAL THING IS ABOUT SHAKESPEARE FOR KIDS IS BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO IT REALLY TO SEE IT
TO SEE GREAT ACTORS PERFORMING IT SUDDENLY ALL THAT DIFFICULTY FALLS AWAY DOES IT IT DOES IT DOES BECAUSE HE WHAT WE WE'VE BEEN STREAMING US WE'VE BEEN DOING OUT A SHOWS RECORDING THEM FILMING THEM AND PUTTING THEM ALIVE OUT TO CINEMAS WE'VE ALSO BEEN STREAMING THEM INTO SCHOOLS FOR FREE
WHAT WE'VE THEN DONE IS THE KIDS GET ON ONLINE AND ASK US QUESTIONS REALLY BRILLIANT BRAINY QUESTIONS ABOUT ABOUT THE TEXT ON ABOUT HOW THE INTERPRETATIONS OF WHAT WE'VE CHOSEN
THAT REALLY ENGAGES THE CHILDREN AND I THINK IF YOU GET KIDS BEFORE THEY HIT CYNICAL AND GRAB THEM WITH SHAKESPEARE'S STORIES WHICH WHAT GRABS YOU FIRST ABOUT BATTLES AND SHIPWRECKS AND GHOSTS AND FAIRIES MURDERS THEY SAY THEY CAN REALLY GET GRABBED WITH THOSE STORIES I LOVE THAT IDEA OF BEFORE YOU HIT THE CYNICAL CIRCUS THAT THERE IS A POINT IN THAT ISN'T THERE THAT WHEN
TEENAGERS BECOME OLDER TEENAGERS THERE IS THIS SORT OF CYNICISM YEAH THERE IS A CYNICISM ABOUT IT OR WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO PULL ON US WHILE I SUPPOSE THAT'S BUT THAT'S PART OF GROWING UP ISN'T IT THEY'RE THERE WHAT THEY'RE EVERYTHING WE RECEIVE FROM THE GENERATION ABOVE US WE MUST AT SOME POINT REJECT BUT HOPEFULLY IF THERE'S IF YOU'VE GIVEN A GOOD GROUNDING IN AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF IT THEN AS WITH MANY THINGS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET THROUGH THOSE DIFFICULT YEARS YOU COME BACK AND REALISED THE VALUE OF IT AND I THINK THAT'S
WHAT A GOOD EDUCATION SHAKESPEARE CAN GIVE YOU IT CAN GIVE YOU CAN HAVE LIFE LIFELONG PASSION FOR IT SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THEN TO THE FATHER OF A COUPLE OF KIDS I WAS TALKING TO WHO SAID THE GAME A COUPLE HE COULD GO AND SEE MACBETH IN THE CINEMA THEY SNEAKED OUT AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD WITHOUT ANYBODY SPOTTING AT THEM THEN THEY SAID BUT WE'LL TELL THEM WE WENT ANYWAY COS YOU KNOW YOU'VE EXPECTED OF US WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE KIDS WHEN I GUESS THEY MISSED SOMETHING DIDN'T HE
GO ON I DON'T KNOW I I DO THINK THAT IT
WHAT'S GREAT FRANK MCCOURT TO READ ANGELA'S ASHES HAD A WONDERFUL THING WHEN HE SAID HE WAS HE WAS VERY ILL AS A CHILD IN TIPPERARY IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND HE WAS ALL THAT HE HAD TO READ WAS SHAKESPEARE HE SAID JUST READING IT WAS LIKE HAVING JEWELS IN YOUR MOUSE AND I THINK ONCE YOU DISCOVER THAT BRILLIANCE ON THE PEAR AND THE EXTRAORDINARY IMPACT OF THOSE WORDS
YOU'VE GOT A PASSPORT FOR LIFE THAT YOU WILL REMEMBER THOSE THINGS FOR LIFE AND YOUR INTRODUCTION TO SHAKESPEARE IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME MAKING SURE THAT TEACHERS HAVE THE KIND OF TOOL KIT TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE GO BEYOND MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM AND ROMEO AND JULIET AND EXPLORE SOME OF THE OTHER PLAYS AND GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THAT WERE EMPOWERS THEM TO FEEL THAT THEY CAN INSPIRE KIDS WITH SHAKES SO THE IDEA THAT THAT YOU HAVE TO BE GIVEN
THAT YOU ARE GIVEN IN WHENEVER IT IS WHEN YOU'RE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WHEREVER IT HAPPENS TO BE YOU ARE GIVEN A PLAY BY YOUR TEACHER AND YOU HAVE TO READ IT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT AND THEN GIVE YOU YOU'D BE WELL YOU RESENT IT RATHER DON'T IT ISN'T A POSITIVE DANGER IN THAT IT'S NOT ONLY THAT IT DOESN'T WORK BUT THAT THERE IS A POSITIVE DANGER IN HER BECAUSE IT SIMPLY TURNED YOU AGAINST IT I CAN'T DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I THINK
THAT'S WHY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH TEACHERS AND THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES THEN FEEL EMPOWERED BY USING TECHNIQUES WE USE IN THE REHEARSAL ROOM AND THEY USE THOSE TECHNIQUES IN THE CLASSROOM GETTING THE KIDS ON THEIR FEET AND SPEAKING OUT LOUD AND NOT SORT OF JUST GETTING TOO BOGGED DOWN IN SOME OF THE BEE THE YE OLDE WORLDY LANGUAGE WHAT HOW DID YOU COME TO IT IT WAS IN SCHOOL WASN'T IT
I HAD I HAD A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS WERE NOW A THEATRE COMPANY CALLED FEATURE ABOUT GLASGOW CAME AND SET UP IN A GYM HALL AND DID A PRODUCTION OF AS YOU LIKE IT AND I DIDN'T KNOW THE PLAY I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT SHAKESPEARE AT THE TIME AND I JUST THOUGHT
THERE WAS SOMETHING MAGICAL ABOUT I THOUGHT TOUCHSTONE WAS THE COOLEST BLOKE I'VE EVER SEEN AND THE COURT JESTER WHO MADE THOSE COMMENTS HAVE EXACTLY AND IT WAS YEAH IT WAS IT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT SEEING IT IN PERFORMANCE WORK WHERE WHERE THE ACTUAL MEANING OF SAP MARKET WORD CEASES
CEASES TO FEEL LIKE A BARRIER BECAUSE YOU JUST THE MEANING GETS TRANSMITTED TO BUT BUT ISN'T THAT THE WHOLE POND THAT YOU'VE GOT TO TRY AND GET IT WELL OBVIOUSLY STAYED AT THE OFFICE YOU'VE GOT TO GET OVER THE ARCHAIC LANGUAGE SO THEREFORE SHOULDN'T YOU SAY GREG OR DID BOTH YOU WOULD YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT RATHER THAN JUST READ IT
LOOK THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME MAGNIFICENT TEACHERS WHO CAN BRING IT TO LIFE IN THE CLASSROOM BUT THAT'S NOT EASY AND YES I THINK IT'S I THINK THE HE'S CHEAPER WROUGHT THE PLEASE TO BE PERFORMED HE DIDN'T HE WAS NEVER IMAGINING THE PEOPLE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND CLASSROOMS AND STUDY THEM HE WOULD BARELY IMAGINE IF THEY WERE THEY WOULD BE PUBLISHED ON PAPER SO FOR HIM THEY WERE THINGS THAT LIVED IN THE MOMENT THAT'S HOW HE WROTE THEM TO BE RECEIVED
YEAH GREAT YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I THINK THERE IS IT ONCE YOU'VE GOT OVER THAT FIRST HURDLE OF OUT OF IT OF IT POTENTIALLY BEING A BARRIER DON'T LET ILLYA BARRY JUST LET IT BE A BARRY WILL EITHER HAVE TO I'M AFRAID GREG DAVID THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED JOHN NEAL AND ADAM COME AND SKI WERE EDITORS IN THIS MORNING'S SATURDAY LIVE COMING UP NEXT FROM JOHN AND ME GOOD
