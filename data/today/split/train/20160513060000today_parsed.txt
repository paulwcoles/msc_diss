GO TO MY WISHING WELL IN THE GARDEN ROOM
AND SAY I WISH I WAS A GIRL
THAT WISH CAME TRUE BUT BE TAKING AN IN DEPTH LOOK INTO THE LIVES OF TRANS GENDER CHILDREN AND WE'LL HEAR FROM MICHAEL CRAWFORD ABOUT IS WEST END RETURNED FRANK SPENCER OF COURSE STRANGE MEETING HE HAD WITH HIS HERO JAMES STEWART
HE CAME IN THE ROOM THE DRESSING ROOM AND HE SAID OR ALL RIGHT WAR AND OWEN FOR TRAP OH
SEE IF HE CAN FOLLOW THAT IS READ BY CHARLES CARROLL OR HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE HAS SAID THAT THE E. USE ATTEMPT TO TACKLE PEOPLE SMUGGLING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IS FAILING TO ACHIEVE ITS AIMS SAND MIGHT BE EXPOSING MIGRANTS TO GREATER RISKS OPERATION SOPHIA WAS SET UP A YEAR AGO AND HAS RESCUED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BUT THE LORD'S YOU COMMITTEE SAID IT WAS NOT HAVING ANY MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE SMUGGLERS HERE'S A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT PAUL ADAMS
SINCE THE FIRST PHASE OF OPERATION SOPHIA BEGAN LAST JUNE YOU SHIPS HAVE RESCUED THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE DROWNED BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THE MISSION WAS SET UP TO ACHIEVE THE IDEA WAS TO DISRUPT THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF PEOPLE TRAFFICKING INCLUDING CAPTURING AND DESTROYING SMUGGLER BOATS
BUT SO FAR THE REPORT SAYS ARRESTS HAVE BEEN OF LOW LEVEL CRIMINALS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF WOODEN VESSELS HAS SIMPLY ENCOURAGE SMUGGLERS TO PUT MIGRANTS INTO ROBERT DING IS PLACING THEM IN EVEN GREATER DANGER
THE MISSION IS STILL OPERATING OUT AT SEA AND NOT AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED INSIDE LIBYAN WATERS AS A RESULT INTELLIGENCE GATHERING IS MINIMAL THE REPORT CITES THE WEAKNESS OF THE LIBYAN STATE AS A KEY FACTOR
THE LEBANESE MILITANT GROUP HEZBOLLAH SAYS THAT ONE OF ITS TOP COMMANDERS HAS BEEN KILLED IN SYRIA MEDIA REPORTS SAY THAT MUSTAFA BIDDER A DEAN DIED IN AN ISRAELI AIR STRIKE ALTHOUGH THE GROUP SAYS IT STILL INVESTIGATING HEZBOLLAH IS FIGHTING IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT ASSAD'S REGIME IN SYRIA ALONG WITH IRANIAN FORCES
BRAZIL'S NEW ACTING PRESIDENT HAS URGED PEOPLE TO UNITE BEHIND HIM SAYING HE WANTS TO RESTORE THE COUNTRY'S CREDIBILITY AFTER A POLITICAL CRISIS MICHELLE TERM AIR HAS REPLACED YOUR MOTHER'S SETH WHO WAS SUSPENDED TO FACE AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN HIS FIRST PUBLIC COMMENT SINCE TAKING POWER HE SAID HE WOULD PROTECT AND CONTINUE HER INVESTIGATION INTO HIGH LEVEL CORRUPTION A CORRESPONDENT WITH A DAVIES WATCHED HIM BEING SWORN IN
THEN WE'VE GOT A GARDEN YOU WON'T BE AS YORK BY BUS AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF LEFT ITS WORKERS PARTY RULE IN BRAZIL THE NEW CENTRES RIGHTS PRESIDENT MADE QUITE A BREAK WITH THE PAST APPOINTING A CABINET MADE UP EXCLUSIVELY OF WHITE MEN SHORTLY AFTER MOVING INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE IN BRASILIA WE TEMA PROMISED TO TACKLE BRAZIL'S CHRONIC ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHICH WOULD UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY AND STANDING OF HIS PREDECESSOR GEAM A RECESS
MISS RECESS SUSPENDED FROM OFFICE PENDING AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL BUT MISTER TEMBE GAVE NO INDICATION THAT HIS APPOINTMENT WAS TEMPORARY ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEEP POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS IN BRAZIL MISTER TURNER SAID HE WOULD FORM A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL SALVATION
THE HIGH COURT IS DUE TO RULE TODAY ON A MAN FROM THE ISLE OF WIGHT WHO ARGUED THAT HE COULD TAKE HIS DAUGHTER OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A HOLIDAY BECAUSE SHE HAD A GOOD ATTENDANCE RECORD JOHN PLAN SAID THE RULES IN ENGLAND ONLY STATED THAT SHE SHOULD ATTEND SCHOOL REGULARLY MAGISTRATES AGREED HE HAD NO CASE TO ANSWER BUT HIS LOCAL COUNCIL WHICH HAD TRIED TO FIND HIM HAS ASKED FOR THE LAW TO BE CLARIFIED
THE U.S. NAVY SAYS THAT IT SANK TO THE COMMANDER OF TEN AMERICAN SAILORS WHO WERE BRIEFLY CAPTURED BY IRAN IN JANUARY THE SAILORS HAD STRAYED OFF COURSE IN THE GULF AND WERE HELD AND QUESTIONED FOR FIFTEEN HOURS I DON'T SKIPPERS HAS MORE DETAILS
THE TWO COME ON BOATS WITH TEN CREW WERE ON THEIR WAY FROM BAHRAIN TO KUWAIT WHEN THEY SUFFERED MECHANICAL FAILURE AND DRIFTED INTO IRANIAN TERRITORIAL WATERS THE SAILORS WERE ARRESTED BY IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS FOLLOWED BETWEEN THE AMERICAN SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY AND HE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER HOW MUCH OF OUTSIDE HEATH AND THE SADIST RELEASED UNHARMED
THE U.S. NAVY OFFICIAL SAID TO COMMANDER HAD FAILED TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP AND HE HAD LOST FAITH IN HIM THE INCIDENT WAS SEIZED UPON BY THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DOYLE TRUMP AND TED CREWS WHO SAID AMERICA HAD SHOWN WEAKNESS OTHERS HOWEVER SAID IT SHOWED THAT EFFECTIVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH IRAN HAD BORNE RESULTS
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S SAYS CLAIMS MANAGEMENT FIRMS RECEIVED FIVE BILLION POUNDS OF COMPENSATION FOR MIS SOLD PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE WHICH SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CONSUMERS THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND REGULATORS SHOULD'VE TAKEN STRONGER ACTION TO ENSURE THAT MORE OF THE MONEY ENDED UP WITH THE VICTIMS HERE SIMON GUMPERT
SO FAR THE SCANDAL OVER SALES OF LOAN INSURANCE TO PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T NEED IT HAS LED TO MORE THAN TWENTY TWO BILLION POUNDS BEING PAID OUT TO TWELVE MILLION CUSTOMERS IN MANY CASES BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF THE MONEY WAS PAID IN COMMISSION TO CLAIMS MANAGEMENT COMPANIES WHO JUMPED ON THE P.P.I. BANDWAGON BY USING BLANKET ADVERTISING WITH PROMISES OF COMPENSATION
HENCE THE FIVE BILLION WHICH THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS SHOULD HAVE GONE TO VICTIMS BUT FOR THE FACT THAT GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY AND THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN FAILED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CLAIMED FOR FREE AS THEY COULD
AND THE WORLD'S OLDEST PERSON HAS DIED IN NEW YORK AT THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN DOCTORS SAID THAT SUSANNAH MUSH AND JONAS WHO WAS BORN ON A FARM IN ALABAMA IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HAD BEEN ILL FOR SEVERAL DAYS IT IS THOUGHT THAT AN ITALIAN WOMAN EMMA MERANO JUST A FEW MONTHS YOUNGER THEM AS JONES NOW TAKES ON THE MANTLE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST PERSON
THE TIME IS SIX MINUTE US EXCUSE ME SIX MINUTES PAST SIX AND THE WEATHER FORECAST COMES TO US FROM SARAH OH KEITH LUCAS GOOD MORNING SARAH GOOD MORNING TO YOU JUMP WELL AFTER A LARGELY WARM WEEK THE WEATHER IS COOLING DOWN TODAY AND IN FACT THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND WE'VE GOT A CHANGE IN WIND DIRECTION TO A MORE NORTHERLY AIRFLOW OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS
TODAY AFTER A FAIRLY CLOUDY START WE WILL SEE MORE IN THE WAY OF THAT SUNSHINE DEVELOPING WHICH WILL BRING US SOME PRETTY HIGH U.V. LEVELS FOR MANY PLACES TODAY STARTING WITH SOME DETAILS IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND OR THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND THE SOUTHERN HALF OF WALES
HERE WE START THE DAY WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUD AROUND BUT THAT CLOUD WILL FAIRLY QUICKLY THIN AND BREAK ALLOWING PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TO DEVELOP SO CERTAINLY SOME HIGH U.V. LEVELS HERE AND STILL FEELING QUITE WARM TOO WITH THOSE TEMPERATURES UP TO AROUND ABOUT TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE DEGREES BUT THERE WILL BE ONE OR TWO ISOLATED SHOWERS PERHAPS THE ODD RUMBLE OF THUNDER PARTICULARLY AROUND THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND SOUTH WALES TOO AS WELL
FURTHER NORTH ACROSS EASTERN ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS NORTH WALES AND NORTHERN ENGLAND HERO A RATHER CLOUDY DAY CERTAINLY COMPARED TO YESTERDAY THE CLOUD WILL TEND TO THIN AND BREAK THROUGH THE MORNING ALLOWING SOME SUNSHINE THERE DURING THE AFTERNOON WILL HAVE MORE CLOUD SINKING DOWN FROM THE NORTH A WEAK WEATHER FRONT ALSO BRINGING A DIP IN THE TEMPERATURE TO SAY FEELING A LITTLE FRESHER THAN RECENT DAYS AT AROUND ABOUT SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN DEGREES
SCOTLAND TODAY WE'VE GOT A WEAK WEATHER FRONT IN PLACE FIRST THING BRINGING SOME LIGHT OUTBREAKS OF RAIN AND SOME DRIZZLE MAINLY OVER HIGHER GROUND THAT SHOULD SINK SOUTH SOON MORE SUNSHINE BUT SELLING MUCH FRESHER ACROSS SCOTLAND LATER TODAY WITH TEMPERATURES JUST ABOUT DOUBLE FIGURES ELEVEN POSSIBLY TWELVE DEGREES NORTHERN IRELAND HAVING A FINE AND A LARGELY DRY DAY ONE OR TWO ISOLATED SHOWERS POSSIBLE LATER THIS AFTERNOON HIGHS AROUND FIFTEEN DEGREES THAT'S FOR THE WEEKEND FEELING MUCH FRESHER WITH SOME CHILLY NIGHTS ON THE WAY
SARAH THANK YOU SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEXLESS TURNED TO THE PAPERS AND OTHER DAILY TELEGRAPH AS WE HANG IN THERE YEARS THIS SITS STORY RIGHT ACROSS THE FRONT OF ITS FRONT PAGE SCANDAL OF THE P.P.I. CLAIM SHARKS IN THE CLAIM THAT THE TELEGRAPH IS MAKING HIM DO THE PEOPLE'S REPORTING ON IT MAKING IS THAT FOR
MORE THAN FIVE YEARS CLAIM SHARKS HAVE BEEN CHARGING MIS SELLING VICTIMS AS PEOPLE WHO WERE INITIALLY MIS P.P. I WANTED TO CLAIM THE MONEY BACK HAVE BEEN CHARGING THEM MORE THAN A THOUSAND SIMPLY TO RECLAIM MONEY TO WHICH THERE ANYWAY LEGALLY ENTITLED AND THE TELEGRAPH QUOTES MARTYN LEWIS THE FOUNDER OF THE CONSUMER WEBSITE MONEY SAVING EXPERT DOT COM SAYING THAT DESPITE KEYNES FIRMS ABOMINABLE REPUTATION THE REAL BLAME
STILL LIES WITH THE BANKS THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO FIND OUT IF THEY'RE OWED COMPENSATION IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT ACCORDING TO MY BIRTH PUSHES THEM INTO THE ARMS OF THE CLAIM SHARKS TIMES LEAD WITH THE STORY THAT SAYS CHINA IS DRAWING UP SECRET PLANS TO BUILD TWO NUCLEAR REACTORS ON THE SITE OF HINKLEY POINT IN SOMERSET IF THE EXISTING
DEAL TWENTY ONE BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF DEAL COLLAPSES THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS A PLAN TO BUY PARTY V.F. THAT'S THE FRENCH ENERGY COMPANY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROJECT AND CHINA THINKS THAT HE CAN BUILD IT CAN BUILD ITS OWN REACTORS ON A FASTER TIME SCALE THAN THE PROJECT RUN BY E.D.F. IN WHICH THEY'VE MADE AN INVESTMENT ACCORDING TO LORD HOWARD HOWL OF GUILDFORD THE FORMER ENERGY SECRETARY FATHER IN LAW'S IT HAPPENS OR GEORGE OSBORNE
IF YOU HAVE STRUGGLED TO FIT ALL YOUR LOTIONS AND POTIONS INTO YOUR CARRY ON BAG THIS IS TO GET ON AN AIRCRAFT ONE PRESUMES THEN THE DAILY MAIL SAYS IT HAS THE ANSWER A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD ENTREPRENEUR HAS CLAIM TO HAVE INVENTED THE WORLD'S FIRST SOLID SHAMPOO BALL CONTAINS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ECO FRIENDLY PRODUCT FOR ONE HAIR WASH IT STAYS SOLID UNTIL IT'S MIXED WITH WATER MAKING IT USEFUL
TRAVELLING WITH THEM BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLASTIC BOTTLE TO THROW AWAY THE BALLS THE MAIL SAYS ARE ALSO KINDER TO THE ENVIRONMENT ALL THE PAPERS LIKE THE STORY OF THE QUEEN IN GETTING A
VULTURE A FIFTY POUND TESCO VOUCHER WHEN ONE OF HER HORSES THOROUGHBRED WON ITS CATEGORY AT THE ROYAL WINDSOR HORSE SHOW HER MAJESTY'S TELEGRAPH BURST OUT LAUGHING WHEN SHE OPENED THE WINNER'S ENVELOPE AND SAW THE GIFT TOKEN INSIDE WHICH YOU COULD CHOOSE TO SPEND OF THE TESCO WINS A STORE AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY PAPER HAS THE SAME THOUGHT EVERY LITTLE
TEN PAST SIX THERE'S AN E.U. EFFORT TO STOP MIGRANTS BEING TAKEN IN AWFUL DANGEROUS CONDITIONS FROM LIBYA TO ITALY BUT THAT EFFORT IS NOT GOING TO WORK PAUL ADAMS THAT DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE SAYS WHO
THIS IS THE HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE JUST IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS E.U. COMMITTEE INDEED WHICH HAS LOOKED AT THIS OPERATION OPERATION SOPHIA NAMED ACTUALLY AFTER THAT A BABY BORN ON ONE OF THE RESCUE BOAT'S LAST YEAR AND SET UP IF YOU REMEMBER IN THE WAKE OF THOSE AWFUL DISASTERS IN THE SPRING OF LAST YEAR IN WHICH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS DIED IN FLIMSY BOATS TRYING TO CROSS FROM LIBYA TO ITALY SO THIS IS A REPORT LOOKING AT THE Y. USE MISSION THAT WAS SET UP
NOT TO RESCUE PEOPLE PRIMARILY ALTHOUGH IT HAS RESCUED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS BUT TO TRY AND AS THE WATER AS THE JARGON WENT DISRUPTED THEIR BUSINESS MODEL OF THE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS TO ARREST THEM TO BREAK UP THE NETWORKS AND TO SEIZE AND DESTROY THEIR BOATS
AND ON THAT PRIMARY PURPOSE THE COMMITTEE SAYS IT'S SIMPLY NOT WORKING AND IS UNLIKELY TO WORK WHY NOT
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT THE WEAKNESS OF THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT LIBYA HAS STILL ONLY GOT A VERY VERY MAY SAINT GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL OR CAUGHT IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT A FEW WEEKS AGO AND IF YOU'RE STILL NOT IN A STRONG ENOUGH POSITION OR WILLING ENOUGH TO INVITE THE Y. YOU FIRST INTO LIBYAN WATERS TERRITORIAL WATERS AND THEN SECONDLY POSSIBLY ONTO LIBYAN TERRITORY TO CONDUCT THESE OPERATIONS AGAINST THE SMUGGLING NETWORKS IT WOULD REQUIRE BOTH
THEY'RE AN INVITATION FROM THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT AND THE U.N. MANDATE TO DO THOSE AND SO AS A RESULT THE OPERATION IS STUCK IN WHAT'S CALLED PHASE ONE OUT IN THE HIGH SEAS SO IT CAN RESCUE PEOPLE BUT HE CAN'T DO VERY MUCH ABOUT THE SMUGGLING NETWORKS BECAUSE THE KEY PLAYERS IN THIS NEVER GO ANYWHERE NEAR THE HIGH SEAS THEY SEND OUT LOW LEVEL OPERATIVES SOMETIMES JUST THE MIGRANTS THEMSELVES BUT HAVE THEY MADE AN EFFORT TO
GET THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT ALL ALL ONE OF THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENTS TO INVITE THEM IN AND TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO GET THEIR MINUTE IT'S THEY COULD'VE FORESEEN COULD NEVER THEY WERE GOING TO BE DIFFICULTIES WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ADDRESS THAT
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE IS TRYING HARD TO TO ACHIEVE PRECISELY THAT IT IS OF COURSE THE SAME REASON WHY HER WHY
NATO OPERATION TO INTERVENE IN LIBYA TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT POSED BY ISLAMIC STATE WHY THAT IS ALSO ON HOLD VARIOUS Y. NATO MEMBERS INCLUDING BRITAIN WOULD ULTIMATELY BE WILLING TO TO CONDUCT SUCH AN OPERATION BUT AGAIN THE SAME PROBLEM HAS ARISEN YOU'VE HAD THESE RIVAL FACTION FACTIONS RUNNING PARTS OF LIBYA
AND ONLY IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS A NEW SINGLE GOVERNMENT BUT I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE SCEPTICAL THAT A BIT A NEW GOVERNMENT TRYING VERY HARD TO ESTABLISH ITS CREDIBILITY AND CLING ON TO POWER WOULD HAVE THE POLITICAL CONFIDENCE TO INVITE FOREIGNERS
ON TO LIBYAN TERRITORY TO CONDUCT HOSTILE OPERATIONS AND NOT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WHICH WOULD BE A BOLD STEP FOR A NEW GOVERNMENT TO TAKE AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN LIBYA OPPOSED TO THAT AND PROBABLY PLENTY OF PROMINENT HIGH LEVEL PEOPLE POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A FINGER IN THE PIE OF PEOPLE SMUGGLING IT IS AN INGRAINED PART OF THE POLITICAL CULTURE IN LIBYA
PAUL ADAMS THANKS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE HIGH COURT WILL MAKE A RULING TODAY THAT WILL INTEREST EVERY PARENT IT WAS HER WHO WANTED TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN ON A HOLIDAY IN SCHOOL TIME ROBERT PIGGOTT IS OUR EDUCATION CORALS PROVIDE EXCUSE ME OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT AND ROBERT THIS IS THE CASE OF A MAN WHO DID EXACTLY THAT HE WAS FINED ONE HUNDRED POUNDS FOR DOING IT BUT YOU FIND FINE PLACE
THAT'S RIGHT HE WAS A HUNDRED TWENTY JOHN ACTUALLY HE TOOK HIS FAMILY TO DISNEY WORLD IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHO'S PROSECUTED WHEN HE FELT OF PAY THAT AS YOU SAY AND THE ISLE OF WIGHT SAID HE'D FELT IN HIS LEGAL DUTY TO ENSURE THAT THE GIRL WENT TO SCHOOL REGULARLY NOW A LOT OF PARENTS HAVE MADE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN TRYING TO DEFEND THEIR ACTION MY PAT DIDN'T DO THAT HE SAID
WITH THE ABSENCE IN DISNEY WORLD AND WITH OTHER ABSENCES OR HIS DAUGHTER HAD STILL BEEN IN CLASS RELEASED NINETY PER CENT OF SCHOOLDAYS AND THAT AMOUNTED TO REGULAR ATTENDANCE AND HE POINTED TO A PREVIOUS HIGH COURT RULING WHICH SAID THAT A HOLIDAY IN ITSELF DIDN'T CONSTITUTE IRREGULAR ATTENDANCE AND THEREFORE HE WON HIS CASE
RIGHT AND IF THE HIGH COURT BACKS HIM DOES THAT MEAN IT'S OPEN SEASON WELL THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION COS THE COURT COULD MAKE I SUPPOSE A WIDE RANGE OF JUDGEMENTS WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE PARENTS' ABILITY TO TAKE CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL BUT I THINK
PROBABLY THE MOST LIKELY THING THEY WILL ADDRESS IS THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF WHETHER A CHILD'S WIDER ATTENDANCE SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT RIKER'S NINETY PER CENT IS THE LEGAL REQUIREMENT WITH IT ISN'T IT ISN'T THE D. F. Y. AT THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION SETS THE BENCHMARK OF NINETY PER CENT SEND US TO DEFINE PERSISTENT TRUANCY AND THAT'S COME UP FROM ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT SOME TIME AGO BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF TRUANCY ONE IS THE ONES WHERE CHILDREN HAVE GONE RATHER OUT OF CONTROL OF THEIR PARENTS' HANGING ROUND THE BUS SHELTER AND THE SHOPPING CENTRE ALL DAY
AND YOU KNOW GETTING UP TO MISCHIEF AT THE OTHER ONE THOUGH IS THIS ISSUE OF TERM TIME HOLIDAYS WHERE PARENTS ARE MAKING A CALCULATED DECISION AND I THINK THAT THE HIGH COURT COULD SAY THAT YES THEY'RE WIDER ATTENTION SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND THE INN THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE PARENTS WHO HAD A VERY GOOD ATTENDANCE FOR THOSE CHILDREN TO TAKE THE DECISION TO TAKE ME TO SCHOOL BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM FEEL IT'S A MATTER OF PERSONAL FREEDOM BY INDEED A LOT OF ISSUES VERY IMPORTANT RULING WILL BE REPORTING ON IT LATER THANKS VERY MUCH VERY MUCH ROBERT
SIXTY MINUTES PAST SIX PERSON HAS THE LARGEST EDUCATION COMPANY DO THE LARGEST BOOK PUBLISHER IN THE WORLD USED TO BE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN JOURNALISM TO NOT SO MUCH NOW LUCY BADNESS HERE WITH THAT THE REST OF THE BUSINESS THANKS JUSTIN YES JOHN FALLON THE C.E.O. OF PEARSON IS A FRIDAY BOSUN WILL HEAR FROM HIM IN JUST A MOMENT FIRST THEY WANT TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE MARKETS BECAUSE A WALL STREET HAS BEEN WITNESSING A FIGHT FOR SUPREMACY BETWEEN TWO OF AMERICA'S BIGGEST TECH COMPANIES
BOTH APPLE AND GOOGLE WANT THE TITLE OF MOST VALUABLE COMPANY AND IT LOOKS LIKE APPLES CROWN MAY HAVE SLIPPED JITTERS OVER THE SALE OF THE IFE PHONE SAINT SHARES AN APPLE DOWN TWO PER CENT YESTERDAY THE STOCK PRICE DROPPED TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE JUNE TWENTY FOURTEEN AND JOINED NOW BY TOM STEVENSON INVESTMENT DIRECTORATE FIDELITY WORLDWIDE INVESTMENTS GOOD MORNING TOM THIS LATERS DIP WAS FUELLED BY A REPORT THAT THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE CHIPS FOR THE EYE PHONES HAS CUT ITS PRODUCTION TARGETS SO IF WE REACHED PEAK I FIND YOU THINK
THAT'S RIGHT SO THAT THE COMPANY IS CALLED TAIWAN SEMI CONDUCTOR AND IT'S THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF CHIPS FOR THEIR NEW FOUND SEVEN SO THE THE CONCERN IS THAT IF THEY ARE CUTTING BACK ON SUPPLIES OF THESE CHIPS THEN IT SUGGESTS THE APPLE ARE MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE LIKELY SALES OF OF THE I PHONE
SEVEN AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS ACTUALLY SINCE APPLE ANNOUNCED VERY DISAPPOINTING FIGURES WAS AT THE SHARE PRICE HAS FALLEN BY THIRTEEN PERCENT IT'S ACTUALLY FALLEN BY ABOUT A THIRD SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND THAT'S AN INDICATION OF THE VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR FOUR APPLE AND CLEARLY YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A SMART SMARTPHONE NOW HAVE A SMART PHONE SO I THINK WE ARE CLOSER TO SATURATION
I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS BATTERED AT THE TOP BETWEEN GOOGLE AND APPLE IS REALLY IT'S A IT'S OF A SHIFT IN THE IN THE DEBATE FROM UM FROM HARDWARE TO SERVICES A BOTH APPLE AND GOOGLE ARE TRYING TO REINVENT THEMSELVES TO MOVE ON FROM THE INITIAL SEARCH ADVERTISING FOLK GOOGLE ALPHABET AND FROM I PHONE HARDWARE FOR APPLE INTO THE NEXT GENERATION OF SERVICES AND TOM JUST FINALLY THE I.M.F. IN TOWN TODAY THEY'RE GOING TO BE DELIVERING REPORT ON U.K. ECONOMY LATER
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO EXPAND TO SAY DO YOU THINK WELL THE I.M.F. OR IN TOWN REALLY SORT OF ASSESSING THE LIKELY IMPACT OF THE REFERENDUM ON ON THE U.K. ECONOMY THEY'VE ALREADY MADE THEIR POSITION CLEAR THEY SEE THE REFERENDUM AS A SERIOUS RISK TO THE TO THE ECONOMY SO IN THAT WAY THERE THAT WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY TODAY'S LIKELY TO CHIME WITH WHAT THE GOVERNOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAD TO SAY YESTERDAY BUT IT'S A BIG RISK TANSLEY WAS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE BALTIC NATION OF DYSTONIA IS A TINY POWERHOUSE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION IT ALREADY OPERATES A DIGITAL IDENTITY SCHEME FOR HIS OWN CITIZENS BUT IS NOW OFFERING WHAT IT CALLS AND E. RESIDENCY FOR THE WIDER WORLD OF APES PEOPLE ABROAD WILL USE IT TO START BUSINESSES THERE WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING TO TRAVEL OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT RORY CATHERINE JONES WENT TO TALLINN TO TRY HE RESIDENCY FOR HIMSELF
IT'S A LOVELY SPRING DAY TALYN'S MEDIEVAL OLD TOWN A FREE CONCERT HAS DRAWN A BIG CROWD IN THE TOWN HALL SQUARE
THIS TINY BALTIC COUNTRY HAS MUCH TO ATTRACT TOURISTS BUT IT'S ALSO A PIONEER IN DIGITAL SERVICES AND EAT GOVERNMENT AND NOW IT'S OFFERING ALL THAT NOT JUST TO ITS ONE POINT THREE MILLION CITIZENS BUT TO THE WIDER WORLD SO I CAN SEE WHAT HE'S MADE
MY LIKE ALL ESTONIANS CASPER COIRCE HAS A DIGITAL IDENTITY CARD GIVING HIM ACCESS TO SERVICES EVEN ALLOWING HIM TO VOTE NOW HE'S IN CHARGE OF HIS COUNTRY'S EASY RESIDENCY PROJECT WHICH BUILDS ON SOME OF THAT TECHNOLOGY THERE STILL NEED A MARKET SO SMALL THAT RESIDENTS WE CAN OFFER OUR OWN SERVICES TO EVERYBODY WHICH MAKES US THERE
BUT SECOND OF THE QUESTION IS THAT FOR US IT'S LIKE MORAL OBLIGATION ORTIS'S AIM TO ENABLE EVERYBODY TO HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS AND INTERACT
WE JUST ARRIVED OUTSIDE A GREAT GLASS BUILDING VERY MODERN BUILDING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TALLY
THERE'S A SIGN OUTSIDE HER DOOR SAYING PUT IT UP A BIT AHMET WHO'S JUST USED AN APT TO FIND OUT THAT MEANS THE POLICE AND BORDER GUARDS
I'M ABOUT TO GO IN AND SEE IF I CAN PICK UP MY E. RESIDENCE
SO I'M NOW INSIDE THE OFFICE AND I'VE HANDED OVER MY PASSPORT AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
BLUE PACKAGE HAS ARRIVED IT'S IS YOUR KEY TO EAT IS STONIER I'M VERY EXCITED
SO WHAT DO I DO NEXT AT A NETWORKING EVENT I MET A YOUNG IS STONY AND ENTREPRENEUR ETHEL REUTERS WHO EXPLAINED HOW ISN'T HE RESIDENT I COULD NOW EASILY START A BUSINESS HERE YOU CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS WITH THE BANKS WERE DILLO ORNAMENT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THAT
INCREDIBLE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE PLACE BUT USUALLY DOES HAVE DONE SO IT'S NOT DOING A PHYSICAL PRESENCE ISN'T REQUIRED SO THAT'S AMAZING NOW IS STONIER PLANS TO COMBINE ITS OWN DIGITAL IDENTITY EXPERTISE WITH THE BLOCK CHAIN THE PUBLIC LEDGER TECHNOLOGY THAT UNDERPINS THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY COMING
CASPER CALL YES AGAIN ONE OF THE CHALLENGE OF BLOCK CHINESE THAT IT'S VERY DRY STATES AND RELIABLE BUT
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE AND INTO IT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO WE DID THE CONTRACT PULLED OTHER PERSON ON THE PROPERTY SO WHILE I THINK YOUR RESIDENTS HAVE DITCHED IDENTITY
ALL THE CONTRACTS AND PROP JANE SMART QUANTOCKS FOR EXAMPLE KNOWLEDGE IT BECAUSE WE CAN PROVE WHO MADE THEIR CONTRACTS AND IN COURT DOES MATTER
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO RING NOW STACK BELT I'M AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE TALLINN STOCK EXCHANGE WHICH IS REALLY A KIND OF VIRTUAL EXCHANGE RUN BY NOW STACK ALL THERE IS IS A SCREEN SHOWING TRADING BUT THEY'RE RUNNING AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIMENT HERE USING BLOCK CHAIN TECHNOLOGY I SPOKE TO HANDS ONLY YOUR CONCEN PRESIDENT OF STACK ABOUT THIS EXPERIMENT
IT MEANS THAT ENI SHAREHOLDER WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT HIM ON A MOBILE DEVICE TWO VOTES EITHER BEFORE ANY GYM
OR IN YOU KNOW MEETING ALL OF THE VOTING ARE STORED IN THE BLOCK CHIN SO THERE COULD BE REAL TIME AND WIN DEVOTING ENTS
WE OPERATE ON THE REGISTER WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE CHAIR OF THE THAT ANYONE MEETING NO BAWDY RESULTS THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT POTENTIAL USES OF THE BLOCK CHAINED BUT HIS STONY IS ONLINE IDENTITY SYSTEM MEANS IT'S WELL PLACED TO BE THE LABORATORY FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY AND NOW THAT I'M AN E. RESIDENT MAYBE I CAN SET UP A VIRTUAL BUSINESS BASED ON THE BLOCK JANE AND MAKE MY FORTUNE OR MAYBE NOT
THERE'S AN ESTONIA SPECIAL EDITION OF THE B.B.C. WORLD SERVICE PROGRAMME TECH TENT PRESENTED BY RORY THIS AFTERNOON
IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR A SMALL CONSTRUCTION COMPANY CALLED PEARSON WAS FOUNDED IN YORKSHIRE IT GREW EXPANDED INTO PUBLISHING AND THEN WENT ON TO A MADAM TO SWORDS AND EVEN AT ONE POINT THEY WATCH UNTIL LAST YEAR IT ALSO AND THE FINANCIAL TIMES AND THE ECONOMIST LEARNING AS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THEIR BUSINESS NOW AND THE COMPANY HAS EXPANDED TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO UNIVERSITY WITH HER COLLEGE
IN A WORLD WHERE VALUE FOR MONEY AS ON MANY STUDENTS' MINDS THEY SAY THEY OFFER SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT SO TODAY'S FRIDAY BOSS IS PEARSON C.E.O. JOHN FALLON ARE CAUGHT UP WITH HIM AT THEIR GLOBAL HEAD OFFICE AND STARTED BY ASKING HIM WHETHER HE REGRETS SELLING OFF THE F.T.
WE TOOK THE VIEW THAT WE WERE REACHING A TIPPING POINT IN THE FUTURE OF JOURNALISM THAT THE BUSINESS MODEL WAS CHANGING VERY SIGNIFICANTLY THE WAY THAT YOU MAKE AND SELL
JOURNALISM WAS CHANGING RAPIDLY IN A DIGITAL WORLD AND IN THAT WORLD THE F. CHI WOULD BE MUCH BETTER AS PART OF A LARGER ORGANISATION THAT WAS COMPLETELY AND ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED ON JOURNALISM
LEAVING PERSON TO BE COMPLETELY ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED ON EDUCATION SO NO REGRETS ABOUT SELLING THE FINANCIAL TIMES OR THE ECONOMIST EVERY MORNING WHEN I CLICK ON THE F.T. ICON ON MY IPOD THERE'S A TWINGE OF PERSONAL REGRET BUT I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION SO TALKING ABOUT THE EDUCATION WHAT ARE YOU DOING SO WE DO HAVE A MIXTURE OF THINGS ONE IS WE
CREATE A FANTASTIC EDUCATIONAL CONTENT FOR STUDENTS OF ALL AGES AND ALL STAGES OF LEARNING
SECOND WE DO A LOT OF THE ASSESSMENT AND TESTING AND INCREASING INCREASINGLY PERHAPS THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING AREA OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDE A WHOLE RANGE
OF SERVICES THAT ENABLE SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES TO EXPAND ONLINE WE ARE A BUSINESS WITH OVER FOUR BILLION POUNDS IN ANNUAL SALES I THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE THE BUSINESS GROW QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE'VE HAD OUR CHALLENGES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS FOR A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT WERE WORKING OUR WAY THROUGH BUT I DO THINK THERE IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION AROUND THE WORLD AND WE'RE DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CAPITALISE ON IT
NOW YOU MENTION CHALLENGES AND I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THEM THIS WEEK WE SAW A LEAK OF SATS TESTS ANSWERS ONLINE IN THE U.K. AND LAST YEAR
PEARSON WAS DROPPED BY IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK TO BE THE TEST MARKETS I THINK PIERCE AND ACTUALLY HAS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD TRACK RECORD AND I THINK THAT WE DELIVERED MORE SECURE CHESS ONLINE LAST YEAR THAN ANY OTHER ORGANISATION IN THE WORLD AND TO BE CLEAR WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN THE U.K. YES WE DID PUBLISH A PAPER A DAY EARLIER THAN WE SHOULD HAVE DONE BUT IT WAS PUBLISHED INTO A SECURE
SYSTEM THAT WAS ONLY ACCESSIBLE BY OUR TEACHERS AND FORMER TEACHERS WHO HAD BEEN PROFESSIONALLY CREDITED TO CARRY OUT THE THE MARKING SO IT WAS STILL IN A SECURE ENVIRONMENT AND WOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ANY LEAK OUTSIDE OF THAT AS LONG AS EVERYBODY RESPECTED THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND ACTED IN LINE WITH THEIR EXPECTATIONS NO NOT ONLY INVOLVED IN THE TESTING SIDE OF EDUCATION BUT ALSO IN HIGHER EDUCATION AS WELL WE'RE SITTING IN THE BUILDING WHICH HOUSES THE PEARSON COLLEGE WHICH HAS JUST STARTED I BELIEVE OFFERING DEGREE
I WAS A YOUNG STUDENT AS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WHY WOULD I CHOOSE TO COME HERE AS OPPOSED TO ANY OF THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES IN THE U.K. WE THOUGHT THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WHICH WAS TO OFFER A CHANCE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO STUDY FOR A DEGREE WHILST ALSO AT THE SAME TIME GETTING DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF WORKING IN A FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANY ENVIRONMENT AND HAVE THE CHANCES OF DOING PLACEMENTS AND WORKING IN OTHER COMPANIES OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT
PART OF THE EDUCATION EXPERIENCE UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE IS NOT JUST ABOUT LEARNING IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING A JOB IT'S ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO BE INDEPENDENT LEARNING ABOUT LIVING AWAY FROM HOME AND MEETING NEW PEOPLE CAN YOU STILL GET THAT WITH THIS KIND OF EXPERIENCE WHEN BUNCH OF EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS WHO ARE NOT ONLY STUDYING BUT ALSO THEN HAVE TING TO BE IN A VERY GROWN UP WORK PLACE HOW DO YOU MARRY THE TWO THIS ISN'T FOR EVERYBODY PRISON COLLEGE WILL APPEAR VERY SPECIFIC GROUP OF STUDENTS BUT I THINK WE NEED A WIDE RANGING GREAT DIVERSITY
IN THE SORTS OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE WE OFFER TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT DO YOU CALL YOURSELF A DISRUPTIVE EDUCATOR I THINK WE ARE THE BIGGEST PUBLISHER OF PHYSICAL TEXTBOOKS IN THE WORLD WE ARE THE BIGGEST ONLINE AND DIGITAL EDUCATION AND LEARNING COMPANY IN THE WORLD SO IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE DISRUPTOR AND DISRUPT IT ALL IN ONE SVEN I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

AND THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS CONSIDERING A TOTAL BAN ON ADVERTS FOR UNHEALTHY FOOD WHICH TARGET CHILDREN THE CURRENT RULES APPLY ONLY TO TELEVISION AND INDUSTRY BODY THE COMMITTEE OF ADVERTISING PRACTISE WANTS TO EXTEND THE BAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO COMBAT THE RISE IN CHILDHOOD OBESITY
IT IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS THREE ARE BEING REFERRED TO THE TABLET STOCK CLINIC IN LONDON THE ONLY CLINIC IN ENGLAND THAT SPECIALISES IN GENDER IDENTITY OUR REPORTERS WHO MAKE A TOUCHER IS THE FIRST JOURNALIST TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN FULL ACCESS TO THE CLINIC SIMMER TELL US ABOUT THAT THE SECOND BUT FIRST JUST A QUICK DEFINITION OF WHAT TRANS GENDER MEANS ABSOLUTELY JOHN WELL IT MEANS THAT THERE IS A MISMATCH IF YOU LIKE BETWEEN YOUR BIOLOGICAL SEX
AND THE GENDER YOU IDENTIFY WITH SAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE A BOY BUT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY A GIRL OR YOU MIGHT FEEL THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY GENDER AT ALL SO AS I SAID IT'S A CONTRAST BETWEEN YOUR BIOLOGICAL MAKE UP AND THE GENDER THAT YOU FEEL YOU ACTUALLY ARE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY SPECIALISE IN AT THE TABLET STOCK AND THIS
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING THERE HAS INCREASED AND VERY YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL YES SOME AS YOUNG AS THREE JOHN FOURTEEN HUNDRED CHILDREN HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THE CLINIC IN THE PAST YEAR THAT'S DOUBLE THE NUMBER FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR SO WE'RE TALKING
FROM ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED TO ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED SO YES AS YOU SAY IT'S THE ONLY CLINIC IN ENGLAND THAT CATERS FOR CHILDREN AND I WAS THE FIRST JOURNALIST TO BE ALLOWED TO GO IN THERE I SPOKE TO SPECIALISTS PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS AS WELL AS NUMEROUS CHILDREN WHO ARE ACTUALLY AT HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY FOR EXAMPLE A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL
WHO WAS A BOY UNTIL LAST DECEMBER AND SHE MADE THAT TRANSITION VERY RECENTLY AND HE'S ON THE WAITING LIST TO GET INTO THE CLINIC AS WELL AS A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS A GIRL AND HIS TRANSITION NOW AND HE'S LIVING HIS LIFE AS A GAY MALE
AND MANY PEOPLE WILL SHOW WHETHER HAVE ALWAYS BEEN KIDS WHO WANT TO DRESS UP IF THEY'RE BOYS AS BILLS OR GIRLS AS BOYS AND TOMBOYS AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE OH WELL THIS IS THE JOY THE GENDER THAT THEY ACTUALLY FEEL THEY BELONG TO ITS AGENDA THEY IDENTIFY WITH SOFA EXAMPLE COLIN WHO'S THE TEENAGER THAT I SPOKE TO IN DEPTH AND SAT IN ON A SESSION WITH HIM AND ONE OF THE PSYCHIATRISTS
SAYS THAT IT'S AN INNATE FEELING SOMETHING HE FEELS VERY STRONGLY ABOUT AND FOR HIM HE IS A MAN AND THE ANALOGY THAT HE USES OR ALL THE PHRASE THAT HE USES WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING IS THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT
IS BETWEEN YOUR LEGS IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S BETWEEN YOUR EARS IT'S WHAT YOU FEEL RATHER THAN YOUR BIOLOGICAL MAKE UP AND HOW MANY OF THEM GET CLINICAL TREATMENT IS SOMETHING CALLED HORMONE BLOCKERS
THAT ARE GIVEN TO CHILDREN WHO WANT TO STOP PUBERTY AND DEVELOPING INTO A MAN OR WHATEVER TO WORRY ABOUT AS THEY GET THERE IT'S USUALLY IN THE FIRST STAGES OF PUBERTY SO AROUND TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS OLD BUT THE NUMBERS ARE INCREDIBLY SMALL JOHN THE STATS GIVEN TO ME FROM THE CLINIC THIRTY ONE CHILDREN
FIFTEEN AND UNDER WERE GIVEN HORMONE BLOCKERS LAST YEAR COMPARED TO FORTY TWO THE YEAR BEFORE IT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBERS BUT THIS IS WHEN PARENTS AND THE CHILDREN JUST FEEL THAT THEY REALLY DON'T WANT TO DEVELOP BIOLOGICALLY
IN THE SEX THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE THAT THEY JUST FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT IT THAT THEY WANT TO PAUSE THERE PUBERTY AND THEN WHEN THEY ARE AN ADULT IF THEY STILL FEEL STRONGLY THEY MIGHT OPT FOR SURGICAL INTERVENTION BUT IT'S CRUCIAL TO SAY THEY'RE NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO DOWN THE SURGICAL INTERVENTION ROUTE AND THEN SOME JUST WANT TO DRESS AND IDENTIFY THEMSELVES
AS A MAN OR A WOMAN THAT CONTRASTS WITH THE BIOLOGICAL MAKE UP SOONER THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL HEAR YOUR FULL REPORT AT TEN PAST EIGHT I KNOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN COULD CONSERVATIVE M.P.S BE BROUGHT DOWN
BY ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HOW THEY RECORDED THE COST OF HER TELL BELLS AND BUSES NOT THAT LONG AGO IT LOOKED A BIT UNLIKELY BUT YESTERDAY THEY ENDED UP IN COURT AND THE SM AWNING THERE'S A CALL FOR THE POLICE TO WIDEN THEIR INQUIRIES TO DO
CONSIDER WHETHER MAIL SHOTS AS WELL SHOULD BE INVOLVED AND WHERE THE MAILSHOTS CONSERVATIVE MAILSHOTS ALSO POTENTIALLY BROKE THE LAW UP LITTLE CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS HE'S HERE LET'S START WITH A COURT CASE ROSS AND THIS REFERS GENERALLY TO THE THE BATTLE BUS AND THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BURNED ON CHANNEL FOUR NEWS IN THE DAILY MAIL AS WELL FOR SOME TIME
A REMARKABLE STATE OF AFFAIRS YESTERDAY THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION NOT ONLY GOING TO THE HIGH COURT BUT CHOOSING TO TELL US ALL IN A PRESS RELEASE THAT THEY HAD DONE THIS TO TRY TO FORCE THE CONSERVATIVES TO HAND OVER DOCUMENTS WHICH THEY GOT IN THE END AND AT THE HEART OF WHAT CAN BE KNOTTY AND OVER COMPLEX IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY SIMPLE ISSUE THE LIMIT FOR NATIONAL SPENDING FOR PARTIES IS HIGH THE LIMIT FOR THE CONSTITUENCY SPENDING TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATES IS MUCH LOWER
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE MONEY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPENT TO SUPPORT PARTIES IS ACTUALLY BEING USED TO DIRECTLY SUPPORT CANDIDATES THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THIS THE CENTRAL IS THIS CAMPAIGNING BATTLE BUS THAT WENT AROUND AND VISITED CONSTITUENCIES AFTER A LONG CHANNEL FOUR NEWS INVESTIGATION IF YOU MENTION THE CONSERVATIVES ADMITTED THEY FAILED TO DECLARE SOME ACCOMMODATION COSTS DUE TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR THEY SAY BUT THEY SAY THEY TOOK THE VIEW THIS BUS AS PART OF THAT NATIONAL CAMPAIGNS HAVE FELL UNDER THE BIGGER LIMIT
WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY FRANKIE WAS A DISPLAY FOR THE PUBLIC GREAT BY THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND WE'VE SEEN POLICE FORCE AFTER POLICE SAY THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THAT OF COURSE CAN RESULT IN CRIMINAL CHARGES AND CRUCIALLY IT MEANS THAT THIS IS GOING TO GO ON FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND YOU THIS MORNING ARE ADDING TO THAT BECAUSE YOU HEARD CALLS NOT JUST FOR THAT PART
OF THIS TO BE INVESTIGATED BUT FOR A SEPARATE INVESTIGATION ON ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS ALLEGED TO HAVE HAPPENED THIS TIME THE FOCUSES ON ON LETTERS I'VE GOT ONE OF THEM HERE SIGNED WITH DAVID CAMERON'S NAME THE RIGHT HONOURABLE DAVID CAMERON PRIME MINISTER AT THE TOP OF THEM URGING PEOPLE TO VOTE CONSERVATIVE SENT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN NO SURPRISE ABOUT THIS THE KEY THING THOUGH IS THAT THEY DIDN'T NAME THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE AND THE CONSERVATIVE VIEW
THEREFORE THEY DIDN'T NEED TO BE RECORDED AS NATIONAL SPENDING BUT THEY DID MENTION THE CONSTITUENCY IN WHICH THEY WERE ASSEMBLY MENTIONED IT REPEATEDLY THE ONE I'VE GOT HERE CONCLUDES THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN STOP ED MILIBAND IN THE S. AND P. TAKING US BACK TO SQUARE ONE IS TO VOTE CONSERVATIVE HERE IN TORBAY NOW THE DEFEATED LIB DEM IN TORBAY ADRIAN SANDERS SAYS THAT'S NO OBVIOUSLY BACKING THE LOCAL TORY CANDIDATE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE COUNTED AS LOCAL SPENDING
IT'S NOT A GENERAL LEAFLET IT IS A SPECIFIC TARGETED MAILSHOT TOOL VOTER WHO DIDN'T CONSTITUENCY SAME
VOTE FOR A CANDIDATE IN THAT CONSTITUENCY THAT HAS TO BE A LOCAL COST NOTHING NACIONAL EXPENSE
HE'S WRITTEN TO THE POLICE DEMANDING THEY INVESTIGATE WHEN I SENT THESE LETTERS TO THE CONSERVATIVES FOR THEIR THOUGHTS THEY SAID SIMPLY REFER TO THE LOCATION WHERE THE ELECTIVES DOES NOT PROMOTE ANY NAMED CANDIDATE GENERIC POLITICAL LITERATURE WAS NATIONAL SPENDING THEY SAY AND THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION FORMAL GUIDANCE IS THAT GENERALLY IT'S NATIONAL SPENDING BUT THAT DEPENDS ON FACTS AND CONTEXT
AND GAVIN THERE THEY'RE A Q.C. MATRIX CHAMBERS HAS TOLD ME THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE A CASE TO ANSWER HE SAYS THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW IS IN HIS WORDS SELF SERVING AND COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC ARE ALL O.K. WE'LL BE TALKING HIM IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT THIS JUST AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK RUSSELL CAN STACKS

IS MORE SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE NEW RULES ARE QUESTIONS HOW THE BE ENFORCED IN PARTICULAR HOW THE AUTHORITIES WILL BE ABLE TO CHECK THAT THE REGISTERED OWNERS AREN'T PROXIES OR FALSE IDENTITIES
SENIOR BOSSES INVOLVED IN THE FORTY FIVE BILLION POUNDS COLLAPSE OF ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND INCLUDING ITS FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE FRED GOODWIN ARE TO AVOID CRIMINAL CHARGES AFTER A FIVE YEAR INQUIRY HAS FOUND INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE AND THAT'S WHAT THE TIMES REPORTED EXPLAINS THAT THE INVESTIGATION CENTRED ON A RIGHTS ISSUE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS TO POP UP THE BANK'S FINANCES JUST MONTHS BEFORE IT WAS BAILED OUT BY THE TAXPAYER IT DOWN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT
SAYS THE DECISION NOT TO PROSECUTE HAS BEEN CONDEMNED AS A SERIOUS INJUSTICE BY BOTH UNIONS AND THE FORMER BUSINESS SECRETARY VINCE CABLE MY GOODWIN WERE STRIPPED OF A KNIGHTHOOD AWARDED FOR SERVICES TO BANKING BUT HE LEFT DERBY S. WITH A LUMP SUM OF NEARLY THREE MILLION POUNDS AND AN ANNUAL PENSION OF THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND POUNDS AND I'D LIKE THE BENEFIT STORY FEATURES IN THE SUN IT REPORTS THAT A MAN WHO HAD PART OF HIS SKULL REMOVED TO RELIEVE PRESSURE ON HIS BRAIN AFTER A STRAIGHT

HE SAYS HE'S PHYSICALLY PHYSICALLY INCAPABLE OF WORKING THE SUN'S HEADLINE HALF AHEAD YOU GET HALF THE BENEFITS FOR YEARS BOOK LOVERS HAVE LAMENTED THE DECLINE OF THE PRINTED BOOK ALLEGED DECLINE REALLY IN THE FACE OF COMPETITION FROM A DIGITAL IMPOSTORS BUT THE TELEGRAPH SAYS REPORTS OF THE DEATH OF THE TRADITIONAL BOOK HAVE BEEN GREATLY EXAGGERATED BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL PUBLISHERS' ASSOCIATION SURVEY OF THE INDUSTRY SALES ARE RISING
DIGITAL SALES ARE DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE INVENTION OF THE E. READER THE ASSOCIATION'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAYS ANALYSTS HAVE UNDERESTIMATED JUST HOW MUCH PEOPLE LOVE TAKE UP
THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING OR HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE SAYS THE E.U. OPERATION TARGETING PEOPLE SMUGGLERS WORKING BETWEEN LIBYA AND ITALY IS FAILING AND US BUT MIGRANTS AT GREATER RISK OF DROWNING IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SESSION YESTERDAY AND M.P.S DEBATED THE FUTURE OF THE B.B.C. AND IMMIGRATION THE ATMOSPHERE WAS RATHER DIFFERENT OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS WITH A SMATTERING OF NORMAN FRENCH AND SOME HUMOUR A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRENT OF WATER
POLITICS NEVER STOPS AND IT'S NOT AS THOUGH PARLIAMENT HAS SHUT UP SHOP FOR LONG BUT THERE WAS AN END OF TERM FEELING IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS I THINK THE NOBLE LORD SHOULD GET A GROUP OF THEIR LORDSHIPS TOGETHER APPEAR ON STAGE AND SING
NO SATISFACTION UNLESS HIS REGISTRATION
LADY CHISHOLM FOR THE GOVERNMENT HAD JUST SUGGESTED THAT THE FORMER LABOUR LEADER LORD KINNOCK SHOULD PERFORM AT GLASTONBURY AFTER HE'D EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT NEXT MONTH'S REFERENDUM ON THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. CLASHED WITH THE FESTIVAL
WHICH THROUGH BROADCASTING COULD RATHER PREOCCUPY THE ATTENTION OF MILLIONS OF YOUNG
VOTES I'M NOT ONLY VITAL TO THEIR FUTURE
TO THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY BE AN AWFUL PITY IF INSTEAD OF PROTEIN THEY WERE ROCKING
HE WANTED MINISTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE KNEW THEY HAD TO REGISTER TO VOTE BY THE SEVENTH OF JUNE THE MOOD WAS LESS JOLLY OVER IN THE COMMONS BY THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER JAMES BROKEN SHIRE WARNED EM PEAS NOT TO DISTORT AND OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS STUDY WHICH SHOWED THAT JUST OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION PEOPLE
CAME TO THE U.K. FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION LAST YEAR BUT DURING THE SAME PERIOD MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS
WERE ISSUED TO E.U. NATIONALS MY BROKEN SHAH SAID THE GAP COULD BE EXPLAINED BY SHORT TERM E.U. MIGRATION TO THE U.K.
GNASHER SHIRTS NUMBERS CAN BE OBTAINED BY ANYONE WORKING IN THE U.K. FOR JUST A FEW WEEKS AND THE O.S. EXPLAINS CLEARLY WHY THE NUMBER OF NATIONAL INSURANCE REGISTRATIONS SHOULD NOT BE COMPARED WITH MIGRATION FIGURES BECAUSE THEY MEASURE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THINGS
HE'D BEEN FORCED TO APPEAR AT THE DESPATCH BOX AFTER THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE CABINET MINISTER JOHN REDWOOD ASKED AN URGENT QUESTION ABOUT THE STUDY MISTER REDWOOD SAID THE FIGURES WERE JUST ANOTHER REASON FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
DOESN'T IT SHOW THAT ALL THE TIME WE STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE CANNOT CONTROL E.U. MIGRATION IN THE WAY WE PROMISED TO DO IN THE JOURNAL
ANDY TOLD THE MINISTER TO GET A GRIP ON MIGRATION AND IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THIS FUNDAMENTAL POINT BUT IF SOMEONE COMES HERE WORKS AND GETS A NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER WE NEED TO PROVIDE PUBLIC FACILITIES FOR
LABOUR'S SPOKESMAN ROB MORRIS SAID PUBLIC SERVICES DEPENDED ON PEOPLE COMING TO THE U.K. BUT EUROPEAN UNION BRINGS US JOBS AND PROSPERITY IT BRINGS US ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THROUGH SHARED PROGRAMMES AND INCREASE THIS IS THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY
AND THE S. M. PEAS EILIDH WHITE FOR HAD SAID NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS WEREN'T A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF LONG TERM MIGRATION IT'S VITAL THOUGHT WE REMEMBER THAT MAKE A PATIENT A GLOBAL PHENOMENON NOT JUST A EUROPEAN ISSUE AND ALSO REMEMBER THERE'S VERY MUCH A TWO WAY STREET
NOW THE LAST BIG EVENT BEFORE THE END OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SESSION WAS THE PUBLICATION OF THE WHITE PAPER ON THE FUTURE OF THE B. B. C. THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WAITING GIRL SAID HE WANTED COMMISSIONING EDITORS TO BE MORE DARING
SO WE WILL PLACE A REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE DISTINCTIVE CONTENT AND SERVICES AT THE HEART OF THE B.B.C.'S OVERALL CORE MISSION OF INFORMING EDUCATING EDUCATING AND ENTERTAINING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST
AND WE WERE ALSO AFFIRMED THE NEED FOR IMPARTIALITY IN ITS NEWS AND CURRENT AFFAIRS BROADCASTS LABOUR'S SHADOW CULTURE SECRETARY MARIA EAGLE THOUGHT THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHANCELLOR HAD LEANT ON THE MINISTER
DEPOSE WHY ALL THE PROPOSALS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN WATERED DOWN
OR DUMPED OR DELAYED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF WHICH IS A MEMBER IS A REFLECTION OF HIS DIMINISHING INFLUENCE AND LACK OF CLOWN HE'S NOT THAT IS
WITH THE SERIOUS BUSINESS OUT OF THE WAY IT WAS TIME TO MARK THE END OF THE PARLIAMENTARY
OH NO
BLACK ROD IS A SENIOR OFFICIAL IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS WHO COMES TO THE FORE ON CEREMONIAL OCCASIONS A KEY PART OF HIS JOB IS TO HAVE THE DOOR OF THE COMMONS SLAMMED IN HIS FACE HE'D BEEN SENT DOWN TO THE ROUGHER END OF THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER TO SUMMON M.P.S FOR PRO ROGATION WHICH IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR SOME NORMAN FRENCH IMMIGRATION
WHICH OF COURSE MEANS THE QUEEN WILLS IT AND THUS THE IMMIGRATION BILL RECEIVED ROYAL ASSENT A FEW MINUTES LATER THE PARLIAMENTARY SESSION WAS PROVOKED UNTIL NEXT WEDNESDAY
SEAN CURRAN REPORT IN THERE AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THE REST OF THIS PROGRAMME IN NORMAN FRENCH JUST STARTING AFTER THIS ITEM TWELVE MINISTER SEVEN DONALD TRUMP YOU COULDN'T IN NORMAN FRENCH WOULD SMELL A RAT HAS MET POOR RYAN WHO IS THE MAN WHO ESSENTIALLY RUNS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S THE MOST SENIOR MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN CONGRESS IS RYAN DID NOT ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP BUT
MISTER TRUMP SAID AFTER THE MEETING WE'RE GETTING THERE SOME REPUBLICANS ARE INDEED GETTING THEY'RE COMING ROUND TO ENDORSING MISTER TRUMP PARTLY SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM OTHERS THOUGH ARE NOT AMONG THEM PETER WAYNE WHO WAS DEPUTY SPEECH WRITER FOR GEORGE W. BUSH AND IS NOW CAMPAIGNING FOR PARTY MEMBERS TO SAY NO TO TRUMP
EVEN THOUGH THAT WOULD MEAN HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BECOME PRESIDENT I REALLY DO
BUT WHAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS WOULD SAY AND DO THE MAN HIMSELF IS THAT THE TRAIL HAS BEEN THE PARTY BETRAYING ITS CALL PEOPLE AND PROMISING THINGS THAT COULDN'T BE DELIVERED AND ALSO IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS JUST NOT PROTECTING THEM YEAH WELL THERE'S NO QUESTION THE TRUNK HAS STEPPED IN AS SOME KIND OF DECEPTION AND SOME KIND OF ANGER AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT DISAFFECTION IT ANCHORS IS AWARDED A JUSTIFIED NOT ALL OF IT BUT EVEN IF YOU ACCEPT EVEN IF IT IS TO READ
WAYNE HIMSELF HE'S BEEN ON ALL SIDES OF ALL SORTS OF ISSUES SO HE'S JUST A FUNDAMENTALLY I'M SERIOUS WHEN IT COMES TO TO POLITICS AND PUBLIC POLICY AND POLITICAL THEORY HE DOESN'T KNOW
THE THINGS THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC IN THIS COUNTRY AS IT IS JUST I THINK LUDICROUS DO YOU THINK THAT THE CANDIDATES WHO STOOD AGAINST HIM AND I'M THINKING OF SENATOR TED CRUISIN MAYBE SENATOR RUBIO AS WELL OTHER PEOPLE WHO DID RELATIVELY WELL PERHAPS JEB BUSH YOU DIDN'T DO THAT WELL BUT HE'S A WELL KNOWN FIGURE DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD PUBLICLY SAY THAT THEY WON'T VOTE FOR HIM I DO JEB BUSH AS I THOUGHT IT WAS IT WAS A MARVELLOUS ACTION RIGHT HERE BUT YET BOUGHT AND I WOULD
BUSH FORTY ONE IN HIS BROTHER PRESIDENT BUSH WEEK THREE BOTH SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T WOULDN'T ENDORSE THEM LOOK I THINK THIS IS IN THIS COUNTRY KIND OF JOHN MCCARTHY MORE MARMOT THAT IS IT'S A MOMENT IT'S A MORE MOMENT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT REPUBLICANS REPUDIATE TRUMP BECAUSE THIS IS THE KIND OF HER WORK SHE AND THAT WILL BE REMEMBERED LONG AFTER THE CIVIL ACTION AND WHAT PEOPLE SAY IT DO YOU
THINGS THAT REPUBLICANS AND CONSERVATIVES BUT WE WERE ASKED TO BELIEVE THAT THE IDEAS ARE GOING TO RALLY AROUND IT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM IS I THINK JUST NOT NOT A JUSTIFIABLE I SEE THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN A CRITICAL LONG TIME CRITICAL PILLAR EQUIPMENT SHE STANDS
HE'S A DANGEROUS TO BE WITH OF THE REPUBLIC I THINK HE'S A DANGER TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN A WAY THAT WHO WERE EQUIPPED NEVER COULD BE IF TRUMPTON THAT BARREL IT WOULD NOMINATION BUT WINTER THE PREGNANCY HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY REDEFINE PUBLICAN PARTY IN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT IN A WAY THAT I THINK ARE VERY VERY PROBLEMATIC AND A LOT A LOT OF US DO THE REPUBLICAN CHILD LIVES COULD IN GOOD CONSCIENCE THE PARTY IF IN FACT IT WAS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US AND THE TIME IS NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN BRAZIL IS IN TURMOIL IT'S PRESIDENT GERMAN HAVE A BOAT TO GO ON TRIAL IN A CORRUPTION SCANDAL THAT ROCKED THE NATION SOME ARE CELEBRATING OTHERS ARE DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER THIS WHERE ALL THIS WILL END ALAN CHARLTON WAS OUR AMBASSADOR BRAZIL FIVE YEARS UNTIL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND HE'S WITH ME IN THE STUDIO THE MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WELL THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS WILL GO ON AND IT WILL BE DECIDED WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS
AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS THERE MEANWHILE WE HAVE AN INTERIM PRESIDENT WE SHOT EM OUT IT IS A MESS AS WE WERE SAYING BEFORE BUT IT'S A MESS THAT REFLECTS PEOPLE'S WISH TOO
BEAR DOWN ON CORRUPTION WHICH HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR BRAZIL EVER SINCE IT EXISTED FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO SEE THE STABLES CLEANED AND THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR BRAZIL'S HISTORY COS BRAZIL ISN'T ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES
POLICE CERTAINLY THIS IS THE IMPRESSION I GOT WHEN I USED TO GO THERE MANY YEARS AGO THAT DO YOU THINK OF AS A CORRUPT COUNTRY IT ISN'T AS IT WERE ON THE STREETS OR CORRUPT COUNTRY YOU ME NOW I AGREE ABSOLUTELY OUT THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN TAXES AND SHOPS IT ISN'T WHAT YOU HAVE IS CORRUPTION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS AMONG THE ELITE OF THE ELITE IN BUSINESS AND IN POLITICS AND PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER PREPARED JUST A SHRUG THEIR SHOULDERS AND SAY THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE AND GET ON WITH LIFE THEY WANT SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT
WELL IN THAT CASE THIS MIGHT BE A VERY GOOD THING IT COULD BE IT DEPENDS ON THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS RIGHT NOW AND THEN AFTER THE ELECTIONS ARE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY MESSY MEANWHILE BUT IF WE LOOK BACK TEN YEARS IN TEN YEARS' TIME ON WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW MAYBE PEOPLE WILL SAY IT WAS A GOOD THING
IT WOULD BE THIS IS A CYNICAL VIEW IT WOULD BE QUITE UNUSUAL FOR A COUNTRY TO CLEANSE ITSELF IN THAT WAY
YEAH WELL NO ONE'S PERFECT NO ONE EXPECTS THIS PROCESS TO BE PERFECT EITHER BUT I THINK IT'S A CHANGE IN SOCIETY HERE YOU HAVE THE YOUNGER RISING GENERATIONS ARE UNIVERSITY EDUCATED WE'RE JUST NOT PREPARED TO SHRUG THEIR SHOULDERS I SENSE EVIL WAYS CONTINUE SO THERE IS HUGE PRESSURE ON THE POLITICAL CLASS TO DO SOMETHING BUT THE POLITICAL CLASS REFORMING ITSELF IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S EASY BUT TURKEYS DON'T VOTE FOR CHRISTMAS THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT THE ELITE DOESN'T GIVE UP POWER THAT IS THE ANYWAY
ABSOLUTELY THAT IS THAT IS THE PROBLEM AND HOW THIS TRANSITION WILL BE MADE IS YET TO BE SEEN BUT AS I SAY I THINK IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT EVERYONE NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO THE PARLIAMENT AND ALSO THE JUDICIARY THE POLICE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THERE'S A NEW POLITICAL MOOD AROUND IN THE COUNTRY THAT NEEDS TO BE REFLECTED ARE THEY ALL IN IT TOGETHER ALL OF THE LOCH THAT YOU NAME
CERTAINLY THE VIEW OF THE LOT OF THE PUBLIC THAT IT'S NOT ONLY THE PRESIDENT WHO IS BEING IMPEACHED BUT ALSO THE WHOLE OF THE POLITICAL CLASS SO THERE IS A HUGE PROBABLY JUDICIARY WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE ON THE JUDICIARY I THINK THE JUDICIARY HAVE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB AND SUPREME COURT THE POLICE THE FEDERAL POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING SOMETHING NOT SEEN SINCE THE DAYS OF THE UNTOUCHABLES ARE GOING AFTER AL CAPONE IT REALLY IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY YEAH SO WHERE MIGHT IT GO
WHERE MIGHT IT GO WELL IT COULD GET WORSE OF COURSE AND THE PRESIDENT WHO IS NOW IN CHARGE HIS FOCUS NOW IS ON THE ECONOMY DEEP RECESSION AND WE WHAT HE WILL HOPE TO KEEP THE BOAT FAIRLY STEADY AND IMPROVING AT LEAST IN THE ECONOMY UNTIL TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT WILL BE A KEY MOMENT TWICE ELECTION IS THE NEXT ELECTION AND PEOPLE UP TO SEE NEW KINDS OF PEOPLE NEW LEADERS COMING FORWARD WHO CAN OFFER A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR BRAZIL
ARE THERE OUT THERE THOSE POTENTIAL LEADERS EXCELLENT QUESTION WELL THERE ARE SOME WELL KNOWN NAMES BUT MAYBE THERE'LL BE SOME OTHERS WHO WHO APPEAR BUT THEY WOULDN'T THEY'LL NEED TO SHOW GOING BACK TO YOUR POINT THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME OLD POLITICAL ELITE AND HOW DO THEY DO THAT
THERE WILL HAVE TO DO THAT BY CONVINCING PEOPLE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD I MEAN THERE ARE ONE OR TWO PEOPLE AROUND WHO CAN DO THAT BUT IT IT'S VERY HARD BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT TO WORK WITH THE OLD MACHINE AND THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT I'M AFRAID THE CURRENT PRESIDENT THE WORKERS' PARTY DOWN THEY CAME IN WITH NEW IDEAS BROUGHT IN SOME GREAT SOCIAL IDEAS BUT THEY WORKED WITH THE OLD MACHINE AND BECAME CORRUPT LIKE IT AND IT NEEDS A NEW MACHINE I'M AFRAID IT DOES IN THE END ALAN CHARLTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED PLEASURE

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH OF MAY THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING ONE HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE SAYS THE E. U. OPERATION TO TACKLE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IS FAILING AND IN SOME CASES PUTTING MIGRANTS AT GREATER RISK
THE MILITANT GROUP HEZBOLLAH SAYS IT'S TOP MILITARY COMMANDER HAS BEEN KILLED IN FIGHTING IN SYRIA AND THE HIGH COURT EXPECTED TO DECIDE WHETHER A MAN WAS ENTITLED TO REMOVE HIS DAUGHTER FROM SCHOOL FOR A FAMILY HOLIDAY TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS CHARLES CARROLL
HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE HAS CRITICISED THE E. USE ATTEMPTS TO TACKLE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND SEWING THAT THEY'RE MAKING MIGRANTS LESS SAFE OPERATION SOPHIA WAS SET UP NEARLY A YEAR AGO FOLLOWING A SERIES OF DISASTERS IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DROWNED TRYING TO REACH ITALY FROM LIBYA THE LORD'S EUROPEAN UNION COMMITTEE SAYS THAT THE MISSION HAS NOT ACHIEVED ITS AIMS AND WON'T SUCCEED UNLESS CHANGES ARE MADE A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT PAUL ADAMS HAS MORE DETAILS
SINCE THE FIRST PHASE OF OPERATION SOPHIA BEGAN LAST JUNE YOU SHIPS HAVE RESCUED THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE DROWNED BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THE MISSION WAS SET UP TO ACHIEVE THE IDEA WAS TO DISRUPT THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF PEOPLE TRAFFICKING INCLUDING CAPTURING AND DESTROYING SMUGGLER BOATS
BUT SO FAR THE REPORT SAYS ARRESTS HAVE BEEN OF LOW LEVEL CRIMINALS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF WOODEN VESSELS HAS SIMPLY ENCOURAGE SMUGGLERS TO PUT MIGRANTS INTO ROBERT DING IS PLACING THEM IN EVEN GREATER DANGER
THE MISSION IS STILL OPERATING OUT AT SEA AND NOT AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED INSIDE LIBYAN WATERS AS A RESULT INTELLIGENCE GATHERING IS MINIMAL THE REPORT CITES THE WEAKNESS OF THE LIBYAN STATE AS A KEY FACTOR IT'S THE SAME WEAKNESS AND THE ABSENCE OF A FORMAL INVITATION FROM LIBYA'S FRAGILE NEW GOVERNMENT THAT'S PREVENTING EUROPEAN NATO MEMBERS FROM LAUNCHING A MILITARY INTERVENTION AIMED AT TACKLING THE THREAT POSED TO LIBYA AND THE REGION BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
THE LEBANESE MILITANT GROUP HEZBOLLAH SAYS THAT ONE OF ITS MOST SENIOR COMMANDERS HAS BEEN KILLED IN SYRIA MEDIA REPORTS MUST HAVE HER BED DEAN DIED IN AN ISRAELI AIR STRIKE ALTHOUGH THE GROUP SAYS IT'S STILL INVESTIGATING HEZBOLLAH POLARIS FIGHTING IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT ASSAD'S REGIME IN SYRIA OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT QUENTIN SOMERVILLE REPORTS FROM BEIRUT
MISTER FORBADE RIDDING IS THE MOST SENIOR HEZBOLLAH FIGURE TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN SYRIA TO DATE AND FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS HE'S BEEN ONE OF THE GROUP'S MOST EFFECTIVE COMMANDERS PLANNING AND CARRYING OUT SOME OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR TERROR ATTACKS IN THE MIDDLE EAST MY BADGER DEAN IS SAID TO HAVE ATTENDED REGULAR OPERATIONAL MEETINGS IN DAMASCUS BETWEEN PRESIDENT ASAD AND HEZBOLLAH'S LEADER HASAN
DESCRIBED AS A RUTHLESSLY EFFECTIVE KILLER HE WAS BLAMED FOR PLANNING THE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE U.S. MARINE BARRACKS BOMBING HERE IN LEBANON HE WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH IN KUWAIT FOR ATTACKING THE U.S. AND FRENCH EMBASSIES HE WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON WHEN IRAQ INVADED THE COUNTRY
MORE RECENTLY HE WAS INUNDATED BY A U.N. TRIBUNAL INVESTIGATING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE LEBANESE PRIME MINISTER RAFIK HARIRI
THE HIGH COURT AS EXPECTED TO RULE TODAY ON WHETHER A MAN WAS ENTITLED TO REMOVE HIS DAUGHTER FROM SCHOOL FOR A FAMILY HOLIDAY TO FLORIDA MAGISTRATES DECIDED IN JOHN PLAITS FAVOUR BECAUSE HIS DAUGHTER HAD A GOOD ATTENDANCE RECORD BUT THAT'S BEEN CHALLENGED BY HIS LOCAL COUNCIL ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT YES OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
MY PATCH REFUSED TO PAY A FINE OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS FOR TAKING HIS DAUGHTER ON A FAMILY HOLIDAY TO DISNEYWORLD IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HE WAS PROSECUTED BY THE ISLE OF WIGHT COUNCIL FOR FAILING IN HIS LEGAL DUTY TO ENSURE THAT SHE WENT TO SCHOOL REGULARLY HOWEVER MAGISTRATES ACCEPTED MY PARTS ARGUMENT THAT EVEN WITH THIS OTHER ABSENCES HIS DAUGHTER HAD BEEN IN CLASS FOR AT LEAST NINETY PER CENT OF SCHOOL DAYS AND THAT IT AMOUNTED TO REGULAR ATTENDANCE
IF THE HIGH COURT DECIDES A CHILD'S WIDER ATTENDANCE RECORD CAN BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN SUCH CASES IT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ABILITY OF COUNCILS TO FINE PARENTS FOR TAKING CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND ARE NOT ALLOWED TO APPROVE TERM TIME HOLIDAYS EXCEPT IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
BRAZIL'S NEW ACTING PRESIDENT HERS URGED PEOPLE TO UNITE BEHIND HIM SAYING HE WANTED TO RESTORE THE COUNTRY'S CREDIBILITY ARE FOR A POLITICAL CRISIS YOU SHALL TELL MEL HAS REPLACED YOUR MURDEROUS SETH WHO WAS SUSPENDED TO FACE AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IN HIS FIRST PUBLIC COMMENT SINCE TAKING POWER HE SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE AN INVESTIGATION INTO HIGH LEVEL CORRUPTION A CORRESPONDENT WITH A DAVIES WATCHED HIM BEING SWORN IN
THEN WE'VE GOT TO GO YOU WON'T BE AS YORK BY BUS AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF LEFT WORKERS' PARTY RULE IN BRAZIL THE NEW CENTRES RIGHTS PRESIDENT MADE QUITE A BREAK WITH THE PAST APPOINTING A CABINET MADE UP EXCLUSIVELY OF WHITE MEN SHORTLY AFTER MOVING INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE IN BRASILIA MICHELLE TEMA PROMISED TO TACKLE BRAZIL'S CHRONIC ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHICH WOULD UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY AND STANDING OF HIS PREDECESSOR GEAM A RECESS
MISS RECESSES SUSPENDED FROM OFFICE PENDING AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL BUT MISTER TEMA GAVE NO INDICATION THAT HIS APPOINTMENT WAS TEMPORARY ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEEP POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS IN BRAZIL MISTER TURNER SAID HE WOULD FORM A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL SALVATION
THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION IS TO INVESTIGATE A FORMER SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE PRESS OFFICER'S CLAIMS THAT SHE WAS ASKED TO ENCOURAGE REPORTING OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS THAT FAVOURED THE FORCE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HAS SAID HAYLEY COURT ALLEGATIONS ARE NOT SUBSTANTIATED
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S SAYS CLAIMS MANAGEMENT FIRMS ENDED UP WITH FIVE BILLION POUNDS OF COMPENSATION FOR MIS SOLD PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE WHICH SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CONSUMERS THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND REGULATORS SHOULD'VE TAKEN STRONGER ACTION TO ENSURE MORE OF THE MONEY WENT TO THE VICTIMS ARE PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT SIMON COMPOS REPORTS
SO FAR THE SCANDAL OVER SALES OF LOAN INSURANCE TO PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T NEED IT HAS LED TO MORE THAN TWENTY TWO BILLION POUNDS BEING PAID UP TO TWELVE MILLION CUSTOMERS IN MANY CASES BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF THE MONEY WAS PAID IN COMMISSION TO CLAIMS MANAGEMENT COMPANIES WHO JUMPED ON THE P.P.I. BANDWAGON BY USING BLANKET ADVERTISING WITH PROMISES OF COMPENSATION
HENCE THE FIVE BILLION WHICH THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS SHOULD HAVE GONE TO VICTIMS BUT FOR THE FACT THAT GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY AND THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN FAILED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CLAIMED FOR FREE AS THEY COULD THE M.P.S WARNED AT THE MIS SELLING CULTURE HASN'T BEEN STAMPED OUT AND AT THE NEXT TARGET COULD BE PENSION SAVERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NEW RULES ALLOWING THEM TO CASH IN THEIR PENSION SCHEMES AND LOOKING FOR PLACES TO PUT THE FUNDS
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WILL ISSUE A SWEEPING DECREE TODAY TELLING EVERY U.S. PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ALLOW TRANS GENDER STUDENTS TO USE THE BATHROOM THAT MATCHES THEIR IDENTITY GENDER IDENTITY THE LETTER CONTAINS AN IMPLICIT THREAT THAT SCHOOLS WHICH DID NOT COMPLY COULD FACE LAWSUITS OR A LOSS OF FEDERAL AID
THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS CONSIDERING A TOTAL BAN ON ADVERTS FOR UNHEALTHY FOOD WHICH TARGET CHILDREN CURRENT RESTRICTIONS APPLY ONLY ON TELEVISION THE COMMITTEE OF ADVERTISING PRACTISE AN INDUSTRY BODY IS PROPOSING EXTENDING THE BAND TO COVER ALL MEDIA BECAUSE OF THE RISE IN CHILDHOOD OBESITY SARA CAMPBELL REPORTS
AROUND A THIRD OF CHILDREN IN THE U.K. ARE CLASSED AS OBESE AND THE BODY THAT SETS THE RULES FOR ADVERTISING BELIEVES IT'S INDUSTRY COULD DO MORE TO HELP CURRENTLY ADVERTS TARGETING CHILDREN THE PROMOTE PRODUCTS HIGH IN FAT SALT OR SUGAR ARE RESTRICTED ONLY ON TELEVISION BUT WAS STUDY SHOWING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY SPENDING TIME ONLINE THE COMMITTEE IS PROPOSING THAT RESTRICTION SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE ALL MEDIA
THE CONSULTATION WILL ASK WHETHER THE BAN ON ADVERTS SHOULD APPLY TO CHANNELS AND SITES THAT TARGET CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWELVE OR UP TO SIXTEEN IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE CONSUMPTION OF HEALTHIER FOODS IT'S ALSO PROPOSED THAT BRAND SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ADVERTISE USING CELEBRITIES AND CHARACTERS WHO CHILDREN A FAMILIAR WITH THAT'S NOT ALLOWED AT PRESENT
GRAFFITI ETCHED BY MEN WHO REFUSED TO TAKE PART IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR IS TO BE SAVED FROM CRUMBLING AWAY AS PART OF A MAJOR RESTORATION PROJECT THE WORDS AND IMAGES WERE SCRATCHED ONTO CELL WALLS AT RICHMOND CASTLE IN NORTH YORKSHIRE BY CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN FROM NORTH YORKSHIRE DANNY SAVAGE REPORTS
IN WORLD WAR ONE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS REFUSED TO SERVE IN THE ARMED FORCES OR BEAR ARMS ON MORAL OR RELIGIOUS GROUNDS GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES OFTEN REGARD THEM AS COWARDS SIXTEEN OF THEM WERE INCARCERATED IN RICHMOND CASTLE BEFORE BEING SENT TO FRANCE TO FACE COURT MARTIAL AND A POSSIBLE FIRING SQUAD THEY INCLUDED A SUNDERLAND FOOTBALLER A CLERK AT THE ROWNTREE'S CHOCOLATE FACTORY IN YORK AND A BOOKSELLER FROM ELY
THEY COVERED THE WALLS OF THEIR CELLS WITH HUNDREDS OF PENCIL DRAWINGS AND INSCRIPTIONS A CENTURY LATER THE LAYERS OF LIME WASH AND PLASTER ON THE WALLS ARE FLAKING OFF TAKING THE GRAFFITI WITH IT HENCE THE RESTORATION PROJECT
THAT WAS DANNY SAVAGE REPORTING THERE IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IN THE UNITED STATES TO GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON AS TOTAL SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT THEY MUST ALLOWED TRANS GENDER PUPILS TO USE TOILETS CONSISTENT WITH WHATEVER GENDER THEY HAVE ASSIGNED THEMSELVES THEY'VE BEEN SENT A LETTER FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN WHICH HE SAYS THAT HE'S NO ROOM FOR DISCRIMINATION IN OUR SCHOOLS OF ANY KIND
IN THIS COUNTRY TO THE WHOLE TRANS GENDER ISSUE HAS BEEN ATTRACTING MUCH MORE ATTENTION OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WE'LL BE HEARING FROM OUR REPORTER SEAMEN COULD HATCH AT THE FIRST JOURNALIST TO BE GRANTED FULL ACCESS TO ENGLAND'S ONLY TRANS GENDER CLINIC I'VE BEEN TALKING TO PROFESSOR JACK DRESS SHIRT OF NEW YORK MEDICAL COLLEGE WAS ON A WORKING GROUP ON SEXUAL DISORDERS SET UP BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION I ASKED HIM IF THERE IS CLEAR CLINICAL EVIDENCE THAT PRE PUGH BESSON CHILDREN ARE REALLY ABLE TO IDENTIFY THEIR GENDER
I DON'T THINK THE THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE HE ACTUALLY ADDRESSES THAT QUESTION WHAT THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SHOWS IS THAT THERE ARE A GROUP OF CHILDREN WHO PRESENT TO CLINICAL ATTENTION WHO DO NOT BELIEVE OR FEEL THAT THEY ARE THE GENDER TO WHICH THEY'VE BEEN ASSIGNED AT BIRTH AND THAT BELIEF HAS BEEN TAKEN AT FACE VALUE BY CLINICIANS AND SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN THE WHEN MUCH OF THE RESEARCH ON CHILDREN BEGAN
TO WHAT EXTENT THOUGH IS THERE IS THERE A DANGER THAT AS
A DISORDER BECOMES PERHAPS I COULD USE THE WORD FASHIONABLE THAT'S TO SAY MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT IT THE EFFECT OF THAT IS THAT WHERE
SOME YEARS AGO WE MIGHT HAVE SAID WELL THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BOY A LITTLE GIRL WANTING TO DRESS UP IN
OTHER SORTS OF CLOTHING FOR PLAY DIFFERENT SORTS OF GAMES WE MIGHT HAVE DISMISSED IT WE WILL NOW TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND PERHAPS SOMETIMES TOO SERIOUSLY
I THINK PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT REALLY DON'T HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH THESE CHILDREN THEY WERE ALL THERE STILL ARE CHILDREN WHO LIKE TO DRESS UP IN THE OTHER GENDER'S CLOTHING WHO ARE NOW GENTLY JUST FOR WE CORE THAN GENDER ATYPICAL IN THAT'S NOW CONSIDERED A MEDICAL CONDITION IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY TYPE OF INTERVENTION BUT THE CHILDREN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THESE CONDITIONS
THEY'RE QUITE PERSISTENT AND THEY USUALLY DRIVE THEIR FAMILIES INSANE IT FIRST BECAUSE THEY INSIST THAT THEY ARE NOW TO GENDER THAT THEY WERE SIGNED TO FASHION HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH IT IS THERE ARE
DATA OUT THERE TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THIS SORT OF JUST FALLING OVER THAT YOU DESCRIBE PATROLS GENDER DYSPHORIA WILL CONTINUE UNTIL ADOLESCENCE OR GO AWAY THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION WHAT THE RESEARCH TODAY DATE SHOWS IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN PRE EACH UP AND WHO HAVE GENDER DYSPHORIA DO NOT GROW UP TO BE TRANS GENDER THERE GROW UP TO BE GAY
AND SIS GENDER SPELT C. I S. GENT OF NEARLY NINE TRANS GENDER NOW AND SOME OF THEM GROW UP TO BE SIS GENDER IN HETEROSEXUAL SO DEPENDING ON THE STUDIES ARE ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE NOW THE MAJORITY GROW UP TO BE TRANS GENDER AND FROM YOUR
WORK CAN YOU ESTABLISH WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO A CHILD HARM
BY ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE THIS SORT OF TREATMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLINICAL SITUATIONS IN WHICH CHILDREN PRESENT WHO FEEL THAT THEIR ANOTHER GENDER THAT THEY WERE ASSIGNED TO YOU AND THEY OFTEN PRESENT WITH MANY SYMPTOMS LIKE ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND SOMETIMES EVEN SUICIDAL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO
TAKE ON THE ROLE OF THE FUEL OF THE OTHER GENDER SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE CLINICIANS ARE FACED WITH THIS THERE MAY BE RISKS AND BENEFITS TO TRANSITIONING A CHILD WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
OR THE RISKS INVOLVED IN THAT AND THEY MAY ALSO BE RESTS AND BENEFITS IN THAT TRANSITIONING A CHEILE IS THERE ANY DANGER THAT WOULD IT EXAGGERATE THE
PREPONDERANCE OF THESE CASES THAT'S A POSSIBILITY BUT YOU KNOW THE THING THAT HAPPENS USUALLY IS WITH ANY KIND OF SOCIALLY STIGMATISED
CONDITION AND BEING TRANS GENDER IS TODAY VERY STIGMATISED TRANSGENDER PEOPLE UNDERGO A LOT OF DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE IN THE CASE WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT THE SUBJECT PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD WORDS FOR IT SUDDENLY DISCOVER HOW THIS SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE LIKE ME SO THE POSSIBILITY THERE PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS IN ANOTHER ERA TWENTY YEARS AGO
SUFFER IN SILENCE WHERE THEIR FAMILIES IN THE CASE OF CHILDREN WOULD SUFFER IN SILENCE THEY NOW KNOW THAT THERE IS THIS POSSIBILITY AND THEY MAY EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY AND THAT DOES HAPPEN I'M SURE PROFESSOR PRESSURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR TALKING TO US THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME
THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN DID THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHEAT AT THE GENERAL ELECTION THERE'S A STRICT LIMIT ON WHAT CAN BE SPENT IN LOCAL CONSTITUENCIES THE PARTY'S BEEN ACCUSED OF BREAKING THAT LIMIT WHEN THEY SENT A BATTLE BUS INTO LOCAL AREAS HAS BEEN A LONG RUNNING INVESTIGATION BY CHANNEL FOUR NEWS IN THE DAILY MAIL INTO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION WENT TO COURT YESTERDAY TO FORCE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO HANDOVER DOCUMENTS ARE NOW ON THIS PROGRAMME THIS MORNING WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT
A SEPARATE ISSUE A LETTER MAILSHOT WHICH ALSO SEEMS TO BE STRETCHING ELECTION LAW GAVIN MILLER AND A MILLER Q.C. IS AN EXPERT ON ELECTION LABOUR COUNCILLOR FORMER LABOUR COUNCILLOR LABOUR SUPPORTER GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND THE LETTER
AND WE'VE GOT A COPY OF IT HERE THAT ROSS HAWKINS WERE SHOWING US EARLIER ON IT'S A LETTER TO INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUENTS
IN HER CONSTITUENCY TORBAY AND IT SAYS HOW YOU VOTE ON THURSDAY HERE IN TORBAY WILL DETERMINE WHO GOVERNS BRITAIN FOR THE NEXT FIVE SUCH A SENSE OF SASHA DID ON THE FACE OF IT AS A LETTER LIKE THAT SHOULD A LETTER LIKE THAT HAVE BEEN PAID FOR LOCALLY IN TORBAY YES BECAUSE THE LETTER ENDS IF YOU LOOK AT IT BY TELLING THE VOTE HAD TO WHOM IT SENT
PLEASE VOTE CONSERVATIVE IN TORBAY ON THURSDAY SO IT FALLS WITHIN THE TEST FOR A LOCAL ELECTION EXPENSE UNDER THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE ACT
WHICH IS AN EXPENSE THE EXPENSE OF PUTTING IT TOGETHER AND SENDING IT OUT IN CURD WITH A VIEW TO OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH PROMOTING OR PROCURING THE CANDIDATE SELECTION TO THOSE VERY BROAD TEST THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT IN THE STATUTORY TEST BUT IN THE MATERIAL YOU PUT OUT YOU HAVE TO NAME THE INDIVIDUAL ELECTED CANDIDATE YOU WANT TO SEE HER LEGS THAT'S TERRIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE CANADA DOES NOT NAME AND WHAT CONSERVATIVES ARE TOLD ROSS HAWKINS IS THAT MEANS IT'S PERFECTLY FINE NOW BUT THERE ARE CASES
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FOUND LIABLE FOR THESE SORTS OF ELECTION OFFENCES WHERE THEY'VE SIMPLY DISPARAGED ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES THAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF PROCURING THE CANDIDATE SELECTION WITHOUT PROMOTING YOUR PREFERRED CANDIDATE YOU JUST RUBBISH THE OTHERS
THAT SORT OF EXPENSE WOULD BE AN ELECTION EXPENSE WHAT AS WELL AND OF COURSE IN THOSE CASES YOU DON'T MENTION THE PREFERRED CANDIDATE AT ALL AND THE OTHER ISSUE THEN IS WHETHER THIS KIND OF MONEY IS TRIVIA ON THE MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON THIS MESH ARE ACTUALLY WHETHER IT MIGHT HAVE CARRIED A LOCAL CANDIDATE OVER
THE LIMIT IN SOMEWHERE LIKE TORBAY THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPENDING IT WAS PROPERLY PROPERLY PUT ON THEIR TALLY WELL IT PROBABLY DEAD BECAUSE THE EXPENSE OF SENDING OUT A MAIL SHOT OF UNSOLICITED MAIL TO A LARGE NUMBER OF VOTERS AND CONSTITUENCIES SUBSTANTIAL IT WOULD NORMALLY BE ABOUT NINE OR TEN THOUSAND AND THAT'S OUT OF WHAT FIFTEEN OR SO THAT THAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO SPEND IN TOTAL
WELL IT'S WHAT I'M THINKING IS THAT WOOD THIS ANYWAYS STILL HAVE BROUGHT THEM IN POTENTIALLY UNDERNEATH THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND NO NOT IF THEY WERE SPENDING LOCALLY ANYWHERE NEAR THE LIMIT WHICH IS LIABLE TO BE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY THOUSAND DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE CONSTITUENCIES THE SORT OF SUM OF MONEY THAT IS SO LARGE THAT IT WOULD BE LIKELY TO TAKE YOU OVER THEM AND HOW SERIOUSLY WOULD CAUGHT TAKE IT
OOH COR TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BECAUSE THE CANNON THE AGENT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO GATHER UP AT THE END OF THE ELECTION ALL THE EXPENSES OCCURRED DURING THE ELECTION THAT FALL WITHIN THAT TEST THAT I'VE DESCRIBED TO YOU THEN THEY MUST PUT THEM IN A TRUE RETURN AND THEY MUST MAKE A DECLARATION TO THE BEST OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND WE WERE TALKING POTENTIALLY THEN ABOUT ELECTIONS BEING RERUN
IN INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUENCIES YES THE LAW SAYS IF YOU'RE CONVICTED OF THE OFFENCE OF MAKING A FALSE DECLARATION YOU ATTRACT AUTOMATICALLY A FIVE YEAR INCAPACITY FOR FOR HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE AND THAT MEANS YOU MUST RELINQUISH YOUR SEAT IN PARLIAMENT IF YOU'RE AN ELECTED M.P. AND ANY OTHER PUBLIC OFFICER I SPENT WHAT SOMETHING ALL THESE THINGS ACTUALLY KNOW ALL THE PARTIES TEND TO DO THIS NOW AND ASHLEY PARTICULARLY
BY ELECTIONS AND A COURT WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS THE CASE WE NO LONGER TAKE THE NOTICE OF LOCAL ELECTION LAW THAT WE WANTED IT WELL THESE ARE FAIR LEVEL PLAYING FIELD RULES THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ENSURE FAIRNESS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATES IN THAT CONSTITUENCY AND IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO A SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE OBSERVED
PROPERLY BUT DO ALL PARTIES FAILED TO OBSERVE THEM PROPERLY IN YOUR VIEW I BELIEVE THEY DO YES I'M GOING TO THANK ME IT'S NOT JUST WE INTRODUCE NATIONAL SPENDING LIMITS WITH DECLARATIONS AND RETURNS AND THE NATIONAL PARTIES TEND TO THINK NOW IT'S FINE IF WE JUST BUNG ALL THESE EXPENSES OFF INTO A NATIONAL RETURN AT THE END OF THE DAY BUT THAT MISSES THE POINT
AND IT MISSES THE POINT THAT THESE ARE FAIR PLAY RULES FOR A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATES IN THAT CONSTITUENTS IN A LETTER LIKE THIS DOES GIVE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL ADVANTAGE TO ONE CANDIDATE AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE DECLARED LOCALLY CAN MILLER Q.C. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ON THOUGH IS EUROPE GROWING I MEAN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY I MEAN SPECIFICALLY THE EUROZONE ECONOMY A MATT MATTERS LUCIEN
YES WE'VE GOT FIGURES OUT ON EUROZONE ECONOMY LATER TODAY AND OF COURSE THEY'RE IMPORTANT FIGURE TO LOOK OUT BECAUSE IT GIVES US AN UPDATE ON ITS HEALTH LAST MONTH FLASH ESTIMATES REVEALED G.D.P. INCREASED BY NOUGHT POINT SIX PERCENT IN THE EUROZONE NOT POINT FIVE PER CENT IN THE WIDER E.U. DOCTOR PETER WEST WAS A CHIEF EUROPEAN ECONOMIST FROM VANGUARD ASSET MANAGEMENT HE'S WITH US NOW GOOD MORNING MORNING WHAT DO EXPECT TO SEE TODAY AND WHY
I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY SEE A REPEAT OF THE NOUGHT POINT SIX NUMBER WHEN WHEN YOU GET THE SECOND ESTIMATES THEY TEND NOT TO BE CHANGED VERY OFTEN IF IT IS CHANGED AS A POSSIBILITY IT'LL BE DOWNGRADED PEOPLE WERE A BIT SURPRISED BY THE INITIAL NUMBERS AND THERE'VE BEEN SOME WEEK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION NUMBERS OUT YESTERDAY WHICH COULD COULD WEAKEN IT BUT BUT BROADLY SPEAKING I THINK WE'LL SEE THE SAME PICTURE AND ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING IS WHETHER THE E.C. BEE IS DOING ENOUGH TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN THE EUROZONE OR WHETHER IT'S REALLY RUN OUT OF OPTIONS
YES IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY I MEAN THEY THEY'RE REALLY DOING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE NOW IMPLEMENTING QUANTITATIVE EASING THEY STARTED BUYING THE GOING TO START BUYING CORPORATE BOMBS AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT BONDS IN JUNE THEY CUT INTEREST RATES INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY WHICH IS AS A BIG SURPRISE AT THE TIME BUT PROBABLY NOT WANT TO DO ANY MORE OF THAT SO AT THE MOMENT WE'RE IN WAIT AND SEE MO TO SEE HOW EFFECTIVE THAT IS BUT
THE JURY'S OUT ON WHETHER I'LL NEED TO BE MORE HELICOPTER MONEY'S BEING BANDIED ABOUT AS A POSSIBILITY THAT'S THAT'S EFFECTIVELY PRINTING MONEY AND GIVING IT TO PEOPLE WHICH I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IN EUROPE BUT IT'S IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT
AND OF COURSE TALKING ABOUT GROWTH YESTERDAY THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY SAID THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN FORGET ABOUT IF THERE'S A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. NOW JUST HOW SOLID AN ESTIMATE CAN THAT BE BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
NO IT'S IT'S REALLY SPECULATING ABOUT THE YOUNG NINE BUT I THINK TO BE FAIR TO MARK CARNEY YESTERDAY MOST COMMENTATORS HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT IF THERE WERE VOTES LEAVE THE YEAR IT WOULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON VOLATILITY IN MARKETS JUST BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY THAT IT THAT IT WOULD ENGENDER AND IF HE WERE ALREADY SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF SOFTENING IN THE NUMBERS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THAT ANSWER NEIL UNCERTAINTY ALREADY HAPPENING AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM
THE M. P. C. WHICH IS THE BANK BODY THAT SETS INTEREST RATES SAID IT'S GOING TO KEEP RATES AT PRESENT AT THE HISTORIC LEAD NOT POINT FIVE PER CENT BUT THEY DID SAY THEY'RE READY TO TAKE WHATEVER ACTION IS NEEDED FOLLOWING A REFERENDUM NOW BRIEFLY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE U.K. OUTLOOK AT THE MOMENT IS THAT WE REALLY ARE COMING UP TO A FORK IN THE ROAD ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD I THINK IF THERE IS A VOTE TO LEAVE YOU YOU IT'S PRETTY LIKELY THAT RATES ARE GOING TO STAY LOW FOR A LONG TIME I COULD EVEN BE CUT AGAIN
ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE VOTE TO STAY IN AND I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY LIKELY THAT THE U.K. ECONOMY COULD SEE A BIT OF A REBOUND WE MIGHT EVEN SEE INTEREST RATES RISING BY THE END OF THIS YEAR SO SEVILLA BINARY SITUATION AT THE MOMENT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DON'T HE SO WESTWAY FROM VANGUARD ASSET MANAGEMENT THANKS LUCY TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN WILL KNOW THE STORY RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS THREATENS TO BRING THE ERA OF MODERN MEDICINE
TO AN ABRUPT AND LUSTY HOLT BUT WE KNOW THE SOLUTION TO STOP HANDING OUT ANTIBIOTICS LIKE SWEETIE ISN'T FORCED THE DRUG COMPANIES TO MAKE THE NEXT GENERATION OF ANTIBIOTIC WONDER DRUGS TO SAVE US SIMPLE DEVELOPING A NEW GENERATION OF ANTIBIOTIC DRUGS WOULD CERTAINLY SOLVE THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM AND IT'S EXPECTED TO FEATURE PROMINENTLY IN THE O'NEILL REVIEW OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE IS GOING TO BE PUBLISHED NEXT WEEK
BUT IT DOES LITTLE TO ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THE DRIVE THE EMERGENCE OF DRUG RESISTANCE IN ANOTHER FEW YEARS WILL BE RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE ARE NOW AS A SCIENCE EDITOR TOM FILLED HER REPORT SCIENCES ARE INCREASINGLY WORRIED THAT WE MAY BE ABOUT TO MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REASSESS OUR WHOLE APPROACH TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE
I THINK THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS THREAT WE ARE IN DANGER OF GOING BACK TO THE DARK AGES OF MEDICINE DO YOU LIKE TWENTY FOUR AT THE PRIME MINISTER SPELLS OUT BETWEEN SOMEWHAT APOCALYPTIC TERMS THE THREAT POSED BY THE RISE OF DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA SO IT'S A VERY VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AND ONE THAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO GRIT
EVERYBODY TO GET THAT GRIP DAVID CAMERON APPOINTED THE ECONOMIST JIM O'NEILL TO HEADED GLOBAL REVIEW TO THE RISE OF ANTI MICROBIAL SYSTEM SO CLAW GLOBAL LOSS OF G.D.P. IT WILL BE
APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED TRILLION DOLLARS IN A SERIES INTERIM REPORTS THE O'NEILL REFUSE HIGHLIGHTED PROBLEMS OF MISUSE HOOVER PRESCRIPTION THE NEED FOR BETTER DIAGNOSIS AND TACKLE THE THORNY ISSUE OF INCENTIVISING THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP A NEXT GENERATION OF ANTI MICRO PATIENTS' TROUBLES HOW ON EARTH
YOU TRY TO DO SOMETHING TO BOOST THEIR SUPPLY OF THE DRUGS THAT WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
BUT FINDING CLEVER NEW WAYS TO ENCOURAGE BIG FARMER TO MAKE DRUGS WELCOME THOUGH THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY DELAYS THE INEVITABLE
AND CLOCKS US INTO THE SAME ONE HORSE RACE WHEN IT COMES TO THE FIGHT AGAINST PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
THE MAIN FOCUS FOR CHEATING AND MICROBIAL INFECTIONS HAS BEEN TO DEVELOP NEW ANTIBIOTICS AND WRITERS THE PROFESSOR OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY AT THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY IT'S AN APPROACH THAT'S FAILED IN THE PAST AND WE DO NEED TO LOOK FOR THE REF YIELDS TO REALLY TRY AND DEVELOP PAM SOME ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO JUST DUMPING CHEMICALS WENT TO BACTERIAL POPULATIONS MARKIN RIGHTS AREA OF EXPERTISE IS BACTERIOPHAGES VIRUSES THAT KILLED BACTERIA
IT'S A PROMISING APPROACH BUT ONE THAT IN THE ERA OF ANTIBIOTICS HAS TENDED TO BE OVERSHADOWED
AND IT'S FORMER FROM THE ONLY TURN IT IN FOR A NOVEL APPROACH TO COMBATING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE THAT'S BEEN FORCED TO TAKE A BACK SEAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED
PROTEIN THAT CONTROLS HOW BACTERIA MOVE WORKING ON THE BASIC BIOLOGY OF PLANT BACTERIA AT THE JOHN INNES CENTRE IN NORFOLK DOCTOR CHECKED MALONE'S IDENTIFIED THE KEY SIGNALLING PROTEIN RIM KAY THAT APPEALS TO GOVERN HOW ALL BACTERIA MOVE
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR INFECTION I'M KNOCKING THIS DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE BELIEVES IS SLEEPY POSSIBLES BOTH TO REDUCE INFECTION AFFECT THEM BREAK FREE OF THE EVOLUTIONARY ARMS RACE WERE LOCKED INTO WITH PATHOGENIC BUGS SO IF WE CAN PREVENT BACTERIAL MOVEMENTS WE CAN PREVENT BACTERIAL INFECTION BUT CRUCIALLY THE BACTERIA WON'T BE KILT SO THE SELECTOR PRESSURE FOR THE BACTERIA TO GET ROUND THE TREATMENT IS GOING TO BE MUCH MUCH LESS
THAT SEEMS TO BE UNIVERSAL BOTH TO PLANT BACTERIA AND ALSO TO HUMAN PATHOGENS
PROTEIN ANTIGENS THAT'S THE MOST PROMISING ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE HIS VACCINATION SO THAT MEANS THAT THE BUG CAN'T DO WITHOUT THEM BUT SHEFFIELD'S DEPARTMENT OF MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY PROFESSOR SIMON FOSTER'S LOOKING FOR NEW TARGETS FOR VACCINES TO PROTECT AGAINST STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS THE ESSAY IN MULTI DRUG RESISTANT HOSPITAL SUPERBUG M.R.S.A. RANK SCENES OF COURSE HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MAINSTAYS OF HUMAN HEALTH CARE
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NOT VACCINES FOR ALL DISEASES OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER POSITION WE WOULD NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE SO IF WE ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP VACCINES AGAINST ORGANISMS WHICH RESISTANT TO ANTIBIOTICS
THIS CAN HAVE A MASSIVE EFFECT ON HUMAN HEALTH CARE NO ONE'S DENYING THE VITAL ROLE ANTIBIOTICS HAVE PLAYED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASE
BUT THE CRISIS OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE HAS PRESENTED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO STAND BACK AND THINK AGAIN NOW OF COURSE WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING AND THERE'S LOTS OF CREATIVITY AND IMAGINATIVE IDEAS FLOATING AROUND
WE MUSTN'T LOSE THOSE IF WE FOCUS TO TECHNICALLY ON THE RELATIVELY NARROW GOAL OF DEVELOPING A NEW GENERATION OF ANTIBIOTICS PROFESSOR LAURA PIDDOCK BELIEVES WE RISK MISSING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BROADEN OUR APPROACH
WE NEED TO LEARN TO JUGGLE WITH MORE THAN ONE ANTI MICROBIAL BALL SO WE'RE AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA I THINK WE'RE IN WHAT WE COULD CALL THE SECOND GENERATION OF ANTI MICROBIAL US ERA
I WAS FILLED AND REPORTING TIME TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND CHRIS DENNIS IS HERE WITH SPORT MORNING JUSTIN YES THE RUNNERS AND RIDERS TO BE THE NEXT EVERTON MANAGER ARE JOSTLING FOR POSITION THIS MORNING FOLLOWING THE DISMISSAL OF A ROBERTA MARTINA'S YESTERDAY ROYAL CUMIN CURRENTLY AT SOUTHAMPTON IS EMERGING AS THE EARLY FAVOURITE BUT HE'LL FACE STIFF COMPETITION FROM FELLOW COUNTRYMEN RONALD AND MANCHESTER CITY'S OUTGOING MANAGER MANUEL PELLEGRINI AND HERE'S ANOTHER NAME FROM THE FORMER ENGLAND DEFENDER DANNY MILLS

A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S SAYS THAT FIVE BILLION POUNDS OF COMPENSATION FOR MIS SOLD PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE ENDED UP WITH CLAIMS MANAGEMENT FIRMS INSTEAD OF CONSUMERS THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE BELIEVES GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND REGULATORS SHOULD'VE TAKEN STRONGER ACTION TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE OF THE MONEY ENDED UP WITH THOSE AFFECTED
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL TODAY ADVISE ALL PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ALLOW TRANS GENDER STUDENTS TO USE TOILETS WHICH MATCH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY THE GUIDELINES TO NOT HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW BUT CARRY AN IMPLICIT THREAT THAT SCHOOLS WHICH DID NOT COMPLY COULD FACE LEGAL ACTION OR A LOSS OF FEDERAL AID
AND THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS CONSIDERING A TOTAL BAN ON ADVERTS FOR UNHEALTHY FOOD WHICH TARGET CHILDREN CURRENT RESTRICTIONS APPLY ONLY ON TELEVISION AN INDUSTRY BODY THE COMMITTEE OF ADVERTISING PRACTISE ONCE A WIDER BAND TO HELP TACKLE THE RISE IN CHILDHOOD OBESITY
FIVE TO EIGHT EVER TAKING A CHILD AT THE SCHOOL TO GO ON HOLIDAY AND SAVE A FEW POUNDS MENU PANS ON WHAT IT WOULD COST IN THE SCHOOL HOLIDAYS WHAT DO YOU HAVE AND I BET YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE DIFFERENCE IN COST REALLY CAN BE ASTRONOMICAL JOHN PLAITS ONE OF THOSE WHO DID AND THE SCHOOL FINED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS HE REFUSED TO PAY HIM TODAY THE HIGH COURT WILL RULE ON WHETHER HE HAD THE RIGHT TO DO SO SELDOM HAS A HIGH COURT RULING BEEN WASHED WITH SUCH INTEREST BY PARENTS AND SCHOOLS ARE LIKE ALL I'M JOINED ON THE LINE
BY MISTER PLATT HIMSELF AND ALSO BY PATSY KANE WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE HEAD TEACHER OF BOTH WALLY RANGE LEVENSHULME HIGH SCHOOLS IN MANCHESTER MY WHY DID YOU DO IT TO SAVE MONEY OBVIOUSLY
I THINK YOU HAVE MONEY JOHN IT WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MONEY THAT WHEN WE WENT TO MY KIDS ROSCOE WAS AFTER SO WHY DO YOU DO IT
BECAUSE I WANTED TO TRY AND GET EVERY MEMBER OF MY FAMILY ON A HOLIDAY TO FLORIDA AND AS IT HAPPENS I MANAGED IT FIFTEEN OF THE MONOPLANE MY DAD COULDN'T TRAVEL BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER PASSED AWAY IF YOU'D HAD A FEW WEEKS BEFORE MY SISTER AND HER HUSBAND COULDN'T TRAVEL BECAUSE THEY'RE PARAMEDICS NOW OF WHITE AND THEY COULDN'T AT THE SAME TIME
BUT EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF MY FAMILY MY MUM MY FIANCEE'S MUM OUR KIDS MY MY BROTHER MY SISTER ARE THERE KIDS WE ALL GOT ON A PLANE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A PENNY CHEAPER UM PRETTY SURE THE FLEX RELUCTANCE IN FRONT RIGHT NONETHELESS YOU WERE FINED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY REFUSED ON THE BASIS THAT YOUR CHILDREN HAD DONE NINETY PER CENT OF THEIR SCHOOL HAD SPENT NINETY PER CENT OF THE TIME IN SCHOOL I MEAN THEY HAD FULFILLED THE OBLIGATION NINETY PER CENT SCHOOLDAYS
JOHN THE MYTH IS THAT IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO TAKE YOUR KIDS ON HOLIDAY IN TERM TIME THAT'S NOT THE LAW SAYS THE LAW SAYS YOUR CHILDREN MUST ATTEND SCHOOL REGULARLY SO IF I HAD PAID THAT FINE IT WOULD BE AN ACCEPTANCE THAT THAT MY CHILDREN'S ATTENDANCE WAS SUPERB AS TO WEREN'T CRIMINAL SANCTION IT WASN'T MY KIDS
RIGHT RIGHT THROUGHOUT THEIR SCHOOLING HAVE NEVER HAD LESS THAN NINETY THREE PERCENT ATTENDANCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR THAT'S REALLY GOOD ATTENDANCE I'LL TELL YOU IT'S BETTER THAN THE GREAT MAJORITY OF POLITICIANS THAT'S NOT QUITE THE POINT IS IT BUT ANYWAY YOU WON'T YOU'VE GOT A SECOND FINE ANOTHER SIXTY POUNDS YOU TOOK UP TO LAPLAND WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL
ALTHOUGH THIS IS JUST ARRIVING IN THE HIGH COURT THAT THE HIGH COURT BATTLES HAPPENING THIS MORNING IS ABOUT A HOLIDAY THAT I TOOK IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SO YOU'RE A BIT OF A SERIAL OFFENDER REALLY AREN'T YOU
I BUT I'LL TAKE MY KIDS' HOLIDAY NEVER A JOHN THE MY KIDS AND YOU'RE WITH IF I CAN GO IN HOLIDAY TIME WE'D IT'S OBVIOUSLY PREFERABLE TO GO ON HOLIDAY TIME WE WERE IN BARCELONA A FEW WEEKS AGO WE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME KIDS ROSKILDE DIDN'T MISS A THING THAT WAS IDEAL SOMETIMES IT'S NOT IDEAL SO IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR AGAIN EVERY MEMBER OF MY FAMILY MANAGED TO MAKE IT ONTO THAT HOLIDAY WE WENT TO LAPLAND SKIING IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
BUT IF EVERYBODY DID IT IF ALL PARENTS DID IT IT WOULD CAUSE MAYHEM WOULDN'T IT IN IN THE SCHOOLS I MEAN WELL YOU'RE PRESUMING OR PARENTS AREN'T DOING IT SO I THINK WE'LL LOOK AT THE FIGURES ON THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT F.O.I. REQUESTS BEEN DONE BY THE MEDIA ON THIS
ONE OF THOSE THAT I LOOKED AT RECENTLY EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND FINES AND THAT WAS ONLY ABOUT I THINK ONE HUNDRED FIFTY COUNCILS ARE SOMETHING THAT WASN'T EVEN EVERY COUNCIL REPORTED ON THAT TO SOMEONE NORTH OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PARENTS A YEAR ARE GETTING FIND OF COURSE WILL PROBABLY BE THE SAME NUMBER WHO DID IT DIDN'T GET FIND IT'S NOT CHANGING BEHAVIOUR TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE ALL AS IT'S DOING IS CRIMINALISING OR ATTEMPTING TO CRIMINALISE PARENTS WHO'D LARGELY ARE DOING ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING AND ABIDING BY THE LAW
BUT THIS IDEA THAT THEY'VE GOT INTO THEIR HEADS THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES GOING TO THEIR HEADS THAT THEY KNOW BETTER THAN YOU AS A PARENT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR KIDS HAS TO COME TO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THERE ARE RULES ON THE RULES HAVE TO BE OBEYED WITH ANY CASES COSTING YOU POTENTIAL STRUCTURAL RULES ARE YOU CHILDREN ATTEND SCHOOL REGULARLY THAT'S THE RULE FOR FOUR FOR THE EDUCATION ACT DOES NOT REQUIRE ATTENDING SCHOOL EVERY SINGLE DAY RIGHT LET'S GET THAT WAS TEACHING SCHOOL REGULARLY LET LET'S PUT THAT TO THE HEAD TEACHER THEN THAT IS RIGHT ISN'T IT THAT IS WHAT THE RULE SAYS THEY MUST BE EDUCATED REGULARLY
I THINK THE ASSUMPTION IS THEY SHOULD BE IN SCHOOL EVERY DAY THEY'RE NOT TAIL OR EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CAN I SAY THAT NINETY THREE PERCENT ATTENDANCE IS NOWHERE NEAR GOOD ENOUGH AT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS ABOUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT SO HE'S BELOW NATIONAL AVERAGE ATTENDANCE
RIGHT BUT THE FACT WHAT WHAT WILL YOU REPLY TO THAT THE SPLAT
WELL IF IF
IF IT REQUIRES EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR CHILDREN TO GET AN OUTSTANDING EDUCATION EXPLAIN THIS ONE TO ME I'VE GOT TWO KIDS AND PRIVATE EDUCATION THE SCHOOL'S OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR MY DAUGHTER WHO'S IN HER STATEMENT IN SCHOOL THE LAW REQUIRES THAT SCHOOL TO BE ONE HUNDRED NINETY DAYS A YEAR THAT'S TWENTY FIVE DAYS' DIFFERENCE AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
THAT THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS RESULTS ARE WAY WAY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SCHOOL ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT EXPLAIN TO ME HIGHER SCHOOL WITH TWENTY FIVE DAYS LESS ATTENDANTS A YEAR
GETS FAR BETTER RESULTS IN A SCHOOL WITH A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AT I WAS GOING I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER SOCIAL FACTORS INVOLVED IN THEN THE LENGTH OF THE SCHOOL DAY IT'S NON SELECTIVE NO SMELLS LIKE
YEAH WELL THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY THE ISSUE IF YOU CHOOSE TO SEND YOUR CHILDREN TO A STATE SCHOOL I DO THINK THE STATE HAS A VERY CLEAR OPINION AND I THINK THE FINING SYSTEM IS PART OF THAT OPINION THAT WE WANT OUR CHILDREN SAFE WE WANT THEM IN SCHOOL WE KNOW THAT SCHOOL ATTENDANCE EFFECTS PROGRESS
WE KNOW THAT SCHOOL ATTENDANCE EFFECTS ACHIEVEMENT AND THAT ISN'T SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE WANT TO LEAD TO FAMILIES WE WANT THE STATE TO HAVE A VIEW THAT WE WANT EVERY CHILD EDUCATED AS WELL AS THEY CAN BE AND WE WANT THEM IN SCHOOL HOWEVER IT'S MEAN THEY'RE THERE SAY IT'S MORE THAN JUST AN OPINION THOUGH ISN'T IT IT IS THE LAW AND THE FACT THAT MISTER
PLATT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE CAN BE FINE AND ANOTHER WILL HAVE A CRIMINAL PEP PENALTY AGAINST HIM FOR DOING SOMETHING THAT THAT PUTS IT INTO A RATHER DIFFERENT CATEGORY DOESN'T IT BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHERE YOU SHOW THE VALUES OF YOUR COUNTRY AND OUR COUNTRY VALUES EDUCATION AND WE WANT CHILDREN IN SCHOOL AND WE DON'T WANT SPASMODICALLY ABS
IF ALL PARENTS WERE TO CHOOSE WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR HOLIDAYS IT WOULD BE REALLY DISRUPTIVE IN THE CLASS OF THE TEACHER WOULDN'T KNOW WHO WAS IN IT HAVE TO SPEND TIME RECAPPING THE LEARNING FROM THE PREVIOUS WEEK SO THAT CHILD DOESN'T FALL BEHIND AND IF THAT'S HAPPENING ON A MORE WIDESPREAD SCALE SO I AGREE THE FINING DOESN'T ACTUALLY START SOME PARENTS TAKING THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL IN TERM TIME BUT IT IS A DETERRENT FOR SOME AND I THINK IT'S THE VALUE OF THE COUNTRY AND IT'S A VALUE THAT SAYS WE WANT OUR CHILDREN TO BE IN SCHOOL
WHERE WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE FOR THAT MANY DAYS HAS ANOTHER VALUE OF THE COUNTRY ABOUT ABOVE PERVY REASONABLE POSITION SURELY MUST
I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE POSITION IS I WE SAYING THE KIDS ARE SAFE WHEN THEY'RE WITH THEIR PARENTS AT THIS IDEA THAT THEY HAVE TO BE IN SCHOOL TO BE SAFE FROM SO IT'S NONSENSE I THINK YOU HAVE THE ARGUMENT THE IDEA THAT THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY COUNTS WHAT IF THAT WAS TRUE
WHY WHEN PARLIAMENT PASSED THE NINETEEN FORTY FOUR EDUCATION ACT AND THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX EDUCATION ACT DIDN'T THEY SAY THE WORDS YOU CHILD MUST ATTEND SCHOOL EVERY DAY YEAH YOU YOU SUPPOSE THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO WHAT'S BEST FOR MY KIDS WELL THERE WE ARE WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE IT AT THAT WE'LL GET A LOT OF COMMENTS ON THAT I DARESAY MY PLAIT
MY MY MY THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH TOP OF THE PAPERS AT NINETEEN MINUTES TO RATE IN A STUDY BY THE OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS MIGHT SEEM AN UNLIKELY FLASHPOINT FOR THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BUT FOR MANY PAPERS ITS LATEST ONE ON MIGRATION CERTAINLY IS THE OWNER HAS FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THE U.K. FOR SHORT PERIODS ACCOUNTED FOR MUCH OF THE GAP BETWEEN OFFICIAL ESTIMATES OF LONG TERM MIGRATION AND THE REGISTRATION OF NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS TO FOREIGN NATIONALS BECAUSE EXPLAINS THE FINANCIAL TIMES
A THIRD OF E.U. MIGRANTS RETURN HOME WITH AN E. YEAH BUT THAT IS NOT OUT OF THE SEA IT BEFORE YESTERDAY SAYS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TELEGRAPH THE OFFICIAL NUMBER OF E.U. MIGRANTS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND FIFTEEN WAS UNDER A MILLION NOW WE KNOW WITH A REAL NUMBER WAS TWO POINT FOUR MILLION THE GAP BETWEEN THE OFFICIAL FIGURE AND THE TRUTH IS AS WIDE AS THE GRAND CANYON WE'RE OWED AN APOLOGY THAT'S WHAT IT'S COLONIST ALLISON PEARSON SAYS THE SUN CALLS AT THE GREAT IMMIGRATION SWINDLE REPORTED EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND MIGRANTS ARRIVING FROM THE E.U. LAST YEAR
THREE TIMES THE PREVIOUS OFFICIALS STATISTICALLY EXPRESS SAYS IT'S A BOMBSHELL THE GUARDIAN LEADS WITH THE ROAST INTERVENTION IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BY THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER SIR JOHN MAJOR HE WILL TELL THE OXFORD UNION TODAY THAT THERE LEAVE CAMP IS CROSSING A LINE WITH ITS ARGUMENTS ON IMMIGRATION IN A WAY THAT RISKS DIVIDING COMMUNITIES THE PAPERS THERE SIR JOHN WILL WARN THAT SOME PRANKS AT LEADERS ARE IN DANGER OF MORPHING INTO UKIP
IT'S EASY THIS IS A THINLY VEILED DIG BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WHITTINGHAM DALE OUTLINED THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE B. B. C. AS MUCH PORING OVER WHAT WAS SAID AND WHAT WASN'T FOR THE MALE OF ONCE IN A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO REIN IN THE B. B. C. HAS BEEN SQUANDERED THE SUDDEN BRANDS THE WHITE PAPER A COP OUT ACCUSES DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE OF GIVING IN TO LOVE THESE
THEY BOTTLED IT A LOT THEY ALLOWED THE CRITICISM OF THE LICENCE FEE TO CONTINUE TAXING YOUR TELLY AND BATTERING THE BEEBS COMMERCIAL RIVALS THE ISLAY PAPER HOWEVER IS WORRIED THAT THE CORPORATION'S INDEPENDENCE WILL BE AT RISK FROM MINISTERIAL APPOINTMENTS TO A NEW UNITARY BOARD THE F. T. PRAISES THE WHOLE PACKAGE IT CREDITS THE PRIME MINISTER WITH PULLING BACK FROM THE WAR WITH THE B. B. C. BIT OF BILLY'S MY WHIPPING GIRL HAD SOUGHT
AND PICTURES OF ABOUND OF THE QUEEN HAVING A LAUGH AT THE ROYAL WINDSOR HORSE SHOW THE REASON IS THAT ONE OF HER THOROUGHBREDS AS ONE IN ITS CATEGORY AND SHE'S JUST BEEN PRESENTED WITH THE PRIZE AND THE PRIZE IS FIFTY POUND TESCO GIFT CARD A HELPING HAND WITH THE WEEKLY SHOP SUGGESTED
SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS AGO CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS WHO REFUSED TO TAKE PART IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR SCRATCHED MESSAGES OF PROTEST AND PICTURES INTO THE WALLS OF RICHMOND CASTLE IN NORTH YORKSHIRE WHERE THEY WERE IMPRISONED OVER THE YEARS THE WALLS HAVE BEEN CRUMBLING AWAY IN THE PICTURES WITH THEM BUT NOW THEY ARE TO BE SAVED AS PART OF AN ENGLISH HERITAGE PROJECT PROJECTS BEEN CALLED THE VOICE OF REBELLION AND DANNY SAVAGES AT THE CASTLE MORNING DANNY
GOOD MORNING JOHN FROM AN ECHOEY DRAUGHTY CELL HERE IN THE KEEP RICHMOND CASTLE IT WAS ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT SIXTEEN THE RICHMAN SIXTEEN CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS WERE KEPT
IN THE SALES HERE AND THEY SCRIBBLED THEIR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ON THE WALL ON ONE BEHIND ME HERE SOMEBODY WON'T THEY CALENDAR FOR MAY NINETEEN SIXTEEN AND SCRATCHED OFF EACH DAY AS IT WENT
ANOTHER WROTE ERNEST LAWSON WAS IMPRISONED IN THIS CELL TO DISOBEY THE DICTATES OF HIS CONSCIENCE AND THERE ARE DRAWINGS SOME OF THEM VERY GOOD ALL OVER THIS WALL HERE BUT THEY'RE GOING THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH THE WEATHER AROUND HERE IT'S CAUSING THESE PICTURES TO DETERIORATE SO A PROJECT IS UNDER WAY TO SAVE THEM KEVIN BOOTH IS THE SENIOR CURATOR HERE KEVIN GOOD MORNING WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO SAVE THESE THESE ARE THIS IS A REALLY PRECIOUS ARCHIVES THESE
WRITTEN IN PENCIL ON THESE DELICATE WALL SURFACES WE HAVE TO PERSONAL TESTIMONY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE IMPRISONED FOR REFUSING TO HAVE ANYTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THE WAR
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE HOW DETAILED HOW MUCH DETAIL DO THEY GIVE HER THESE MEN'S LIVES THEY GIVE LITTLE INSIGHTS DON'T THEY SOME OF THEM ARE PERSONAL OF LOVED ONES SOME OF THEM ARE A SOCIALIST STATEMENTS QUITE DEFIANT SOME OF THEM QUITE WRY AND HUMOROUS BUT
IT GIVES A SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING THROUGH THE MINDS OF THESE MEN WHO ARE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM AFTERWARDS
WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO THEM AFTERWARDS IN THE MOMENT BUT LET ME JUST GO TO A NEIGHBOURING CELL WALKING DOWN THE CORRIDOR HERE INTO ANOTHER ONE WITH MORE GRAFFITI ON THE WALL AT ONE OF THEM WAS A SUNDERLAND FOOTBALL OF ONE OF THE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS HIS NAME WAS NORMAN GORDY AND HE DREW A PICTURE OF HIS MOTHER ON THE WALL HERE AND WITH ME IS HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW MARJORIE GOOD MORNING MARJORIE WHAT DO YOU THINK WHEN YOU SEE SOME OF US THE HISTORY OF YOUR FAMILY ON THIS WALL HERE
I THINK IT'S AMAZING THAT A STAND THAT MY FATHER IN LAW TOOK MANY YEARS AGO
FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED SHE'D STILL HAVE BEEN RECORDED BECAUSE OF A PICTURE DRAWN ON THE WALL IN THE PRISON CELL WHAT DO YOU MAKE AT THE STANCE HE TOOK BECAUSE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS WERE REGARDED BY MANY AS SHIRKERS BY THE GOVERNMENT AS COWARDS AT THE TIME WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT HE DID
IT WAS A VERY COURAGEOUS THING TO DO
BECAUSE HIS FRIENDS AND EVERYBODY ELSE AROUND HIM WERE GOING INTO A WAR AND HE TOOK THIS STUFF
AND IT TOOK GREAT COURAGE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM
I'M THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO BACK TO KEVIN BRIEFLY I SUPPOSE THE BURNING QUESTION IS WHAT DID HAPPEN TO THE RICHMOND SIXTY
THEY WERE TAKEN TO FRIENDS A NUMBER WITH A LOT OF THE NUMBER OF OTHERS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY COURT MARSHALLED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH THANKFULLY COMMUTER THAT LAST MINUTE TO HARD LABOUR
AND THEY WERE THE MOST FAMOUS CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS HAVE THE WAR PERHAPS THE RICHMAN SIXTEEN OF THE WAR THERE WERE MANY OTHERS HE TOOK A SIMILAR STANCE AND MANY OTHERS WHO DEFIED THE DIKTAT OF THE COUNTRY BUT YES THEY REALLY SET IN TRAIN THE IDEA OF HAVING FREEDOM EXPRESSION OF CONSCIENCE BOTH OF YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THIS MORNING THAT'S GREAT SO THERE YOU GO THIS WILL BE PRESERVED THESE WALLS WILL BE
COATED SO THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO COME IN HERE TO RICHMOND CASTLE IN THE FUTURE TO SEE THIS GRAFFITI SIR SEE THIS BIT OF SOCIAL HISTORY UNTIL THEN YOU CAN SEE THEM ONLINE BUT HOPEFULLY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO COME AND SEE THEM IN PERSON IN THIS BEAUTIFUL PART OF ENGLAND IN YEARS TO COME BACK TO YOU
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS TWELVE MINUTES TO IT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER AND A NORWICH STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE RIGHT REVEREND JAMES WHO WAS BISHOP OF NORWICH MORNING GOOD MORNING ON A DAY THE SUPERSTITIOUS ARE SAID TO FEAR FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH THERE'S EVEN A WORD FOR THE STATE OF ANXIETY THE STATE GENERATES PARA SCURVY DICK OR TRY A PHOBIA THAT MAYBE THE LONGEST WORD EVER USED ON THOUGHT FOR THE DAY SO WHY IS FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH SUPPOSEDLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO MISFORTUNE
SOME ARGUE IT'S THE COMBINATION OF FRIDAY BEING THE DAY OF CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION AND THIRTEEN BEING THE NUMBER OF THOSE PRESENT AT THE LAST SUPPER BEFORE JUDAS FLED THE TABLE TO BETRAY JESUS
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE AN EVEN OLDER FEAR OF THE NUMBER THIRTEEN LINKED TO THE HONOUR IN WHICH THE NUMBER TWELVE WAS HELD THERE ARE TWELVE MONTHS IN THE YEAR TWELVE HOURS OF THE CLOCK TWELVE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TWELVE GODS OF OLYMPUS THE LIST COULD GO ON
TO REACH THIRTEEN WAS TO TRAVEL INTO UNKNOWN AND RISKY TERRITORY SO SUMS TALL BUILDINGS HAVE NO THIRTEENTH FLOOR AND SOME STREETS NO HOUSE WITH THEIR NUMBER THIRTEEN AS IF TO AVOID SOME UNSPECIFIED DANGER BINGO CALLERS ANNOUNCED THIRTEEN UNLUCKY FOR SOME IT ALL SEEMS RIDICULOUSLY IRRATIONAL YET THE LEAST SUPERSTITIOUS OFFICE MAY WISH SOMEONE GOOD LUCK I REMEMBER DOING SO I WAS A YOUNG PRIEST ONLY TO BE FIRMLY ADMONISH THAT LUCK WASN'T A CHRISTIAN CONCEPT
I WAS TOLD GOD DID NOT GIVE OR WITHHOLD FAVOURS INDISCRIMINATELY BUT I ARGUED LIFE DOES SOMETIMES SEEM RANDOM IT STILL DOES WE MAY BLESS OUR GOOD FORTUNE THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING TO RISK LIFE AND LIMB AS MIGRANTS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WE MAY FEEL LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN BORN TO LOVING PARENTS IN A SECURE FAMILY HAVING DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE IT
BUT I DO UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS TOLD OFF ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WE SHAPE OUR LIVES BY A VISION HARD WORK AND DETERMINATION SIMPLY WAITING FOR A LUCKY BREAK ISN'T ENOUGH WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T RECOGNISE THE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY WHEN IT CAME IF WE SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE NOTHING I THINK THIS MUST BE WHY WHEN NAPOLEON WAS SELECTING HIS GENERALS ONCE HE WAS A SHORT OF THEIR COMPETENCE HE'D ASK BUT ARE THEY LUCKY
JESUS NEVER WISHED ANYONE GOOD LUCK INSTEAD HE WAS VERY KEEN ON GIVING BLESSINGS AND THEY WERE TARGETED IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT IT'S THE POOR THE MEEK THE BEREAVED AND THE PERSECUTED TO WERE BLESSED THEY'RE THE VERY ONES MOST OF US THINK OUR UNLUCKY INSTEAD THEY ON THE RECEIVING END OF DIVINE FAVOUR PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE LEAST CONCERN TO PRESERVE THEIR POSSESSIONS OR SECURITY AND OTHER MOST OPEN TO CHANGE
ON FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH IT COULD BE THAT IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CAUSES OUR DEEPEST ANXIETIES WHICH NEEDS A RETHINK
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE RIGHT REVEREND GRAHAM JAMES THE BISHOP OF NORWICH THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT THERE ARE FEWER PEOPLE MAKING THEIR DANGEROUS JOURNEY FROM TURKEY TO GREECE THAT IS OF COURSE GOOD FOR THEM THERE ARE FEWER DEATHS AT SEA AND GOOD FOR EUROPE TOO AS IT TRIES TO ACCOMMODATE LOOK AFTER THOSE WHO ALREADY ARRIVED BUT THE DEAL WITH TURKEY THAT'S LED TO THIS REDUCTION IN NUMBERS IS LOOKING VERY FRAGILE THERE IS EVIDENCE TO THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE A MUCH MORE DANGEROUS JOURNEY FROM LIBYA
INTO ITALY AND A SUGGESTION THIS MORNING FROM THE HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE THAT THE EFFORT TO CUT OFF THAT ROOT HER IS DOOMED TO FAILURE LET'S TALK TALK FIRST TO CHRISTIAN PHRASING WAS A CORRESPONDENT IS ACTUALLY ON A SEARCH AND RESCUE BOAT OFF THE COAST OF ITALY AND KRISTIAN WHAT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING HAPPENING ON THAT BACK
WE'RE HEADING FULL SPEED AT THE MOMENT THIRTEEN KNOTS FROM THE LIBYAN COASTLINE TO THE COAST OF CALABRIA
AND ON THE STERN OF THE SHIP HERE I'M LOOKING AT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS LARGELY FROM WEST AFRICA
AND AMONG THEM FIFTY ONE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN AND THEY'RE EXTREMELY LUCKY
TO BE ALIVE WE PICKED THEM UP ON TO RUBBER BOATS DRIFTING AROUND TWENTY FOUR MILES OUT TO SEA EAST OF TRIPOLI ON WEDNESDAY EVENING
AND I SAY LUCKY TO BE ALIVE BECAUSE HAD WE BEEN AN HOUR LATER AN ALMIGHTY SQUALL KICKED UP IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AS HE TENDS TO DO IN THE MEDITERRANEAN THE WEATHER IS QUITE UNPREDICTABLE AND THEIR BOAT WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN CONSUMED BY THE WAY SO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD HAVE WE NOT BEEN
AND ALREADY THIS YEAR A THOUSAND MIGRANTS HAVE DROWNED TRYING THE SAME JOURNEY BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE LORDS COMMITTEE HAS SAID IS THAT THE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS HAVE MOVED FROM THE WOODEN BOATS TO THESE RUBBER SUBSTITUTE SO MUCH CHEAPER
THEY'RE IMPORTED FROM THE FAR EAST FROM CHINA
AND THEY'RE EASILY INFLATABLE ON THE BEACHES YOU CAN GIVE RUDIMENTARY TRAINING TO MY TO OPERATE
THE OUTBOARD ENGINE AND THEN THEY'RE PUSHED OUT TO SEA WITH A COMPASS A LITTLE BIT A FUEL JUST ENOUGH TO GET THEM THE TWELVE MILES TO INTERNATIONAL WATERS
AND THE SAFETY OF THE CARGO OF COURSE TO THE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS IS INCIDENTAL BECAUSE THIS IS A LOW RISK
PROFIT BUSINESS AND AT THE MOMENT AS THE LORD SAY OPERATION SOPHIA
HE'S FAILING MISERABLY OH KAY WERE CHRISTIAN FRASER ON THAT CHEF THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S TURN TO LAW TO HEART WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE AND HE'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU AND THAT THE QUESTION RAISED BY WHAT YOUR COMMITTEE HAS FAT ONE WHICH IS THAT AT THE MOMENT THINGS ARE NOT WORKING IS WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE AND COULD REASONABLY DONE
TO MAKE THE PREVENTION OF THIS KIND OF THIS KIND OF INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS SEA PASSAGE MORE CERTAIN
WELL ANOTHER MATTER IS LIBYA LIBYA IS A FAILED STATE IT IS THERE'S NO ONE WITH ROOM TO DO A DEAL THERE'S NO ONE WHO CAN IMPOSE ANY ORDER IF YOU LOOK AT MOROCCO THERE'S VERY LITTLE OF PEOPLE TRAFFICKING FROM MOROCCO TO EUROPE MUCH LESS FOR MAJOR
SO UNTIL THERE'S AN ORDERLY GOVERNMENT IN PLACE IN LIBYA THIS PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE VERY INTRACTABLE YOU CAN'T GET GOOD INTELLIGENCE IF YOU'RE OPERATING ON THE HIGH SEAS YOU CAN'T GET REALLY TACKLE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ORGANISING THE BUSINESS IF YOU CAN'T GO ON SURE
LOOKING FURTHER AHEAD OF COURSE WE DO NEED A COORDINATED APPROACH TO THE COUNTRIES FROM WHICH THE MIGRANTS ARE COMING AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE COULD ESTABLISH FACILITIES IN SOME OF THE TRANSIT CAMP OR COUNTRIES THAT LIBYA IS THE KEY THAT I THOUGHT THE INITIAL
THINKING BEHIND THIS OPERATION WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ATTEMPT NOT JUST TO PICK PEOPLE UP ON C. BUT TO DISRUPT THE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS ACTUALLY AT HOME AND THAT THEY WOULD ORGANISE A SOME KIND OF INVITATION FROM AT LEAST ONE OF THE LIBYAN ENTITIES SO THEY GO AND DO THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THAT IS WHAT HAS NOT HAPPENED AND THERE ISN'T A UNITED NATIONS RESOLUTION THAT ENABLES OPERATIONS HAVE FEAR
TO OPERATE IN TERRITORIAL WATERS OR ON AND WITHOUT A U.N. RESOLUTION IT CAN'T BE DONE SO UNTIL THERE'S AN ORDERLY GOVERNMENT IN LIBYA THERE IS A REALLY INTRACTABLE PROBLEM
BUT I MUST EMPHASISE SAVING LIVES IS A GOOD THING I MEAN THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO DISRUPT THE PEOPLE SMUGGLING BUT WE MUSTN'T UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF SAVING LIE ABSOLUTELY AND IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THAT FROM CHRISTIAN FRASER THOSE PEOPLE WERE LUCKY WHO ARE ON HIS SHIP THEN THE RISK IS
BUT THERE COULD BE HUNDREDS THOUSANDS WHO ARE NOT SO LUCKY AND WHO STILL PUT TO SEA BECAUSE THIS THIS OPERATION IS NOT PROPERLY WORKING ABSOLUTELY AND THE PARADOXES OF COURSE AT THAT
BECAUSE THE SMUGGLERS KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN NAVAL VESSELS OUT THERE WHO WILL PICK UP THE THE THE DINGHY IS IN A PARADOXICAL KIND OF A WAY IT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT ALL RIGHT NO TALKING TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE'S TEN FINALLY TO CATCH HER EDITOR WHO IS HERE AND IF I COULD TAMPER WITH YOU CATCH IT OR WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN TURKEY AND GREECE HOW HOW DEEP DEEPER TROUBLE IS THAT DELIA
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF TROUBLE ROUND THE CORNER IF YOU FORGIVE ME THEY JUST I JUST WANT TO STEP BACK TO HAVE A LOOK AT OPERATION SOPHIA AND THAT OPERATION IN THE AEGEAN AS WELL BETWEEN TURKEY AND GREECE BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE HAVE A LOOK ABOUT WHETHER THESE OPERATIONS ARE A SUCCESS OR NOT IT SOUNDS PRACTICAL TOO TO CRACK DOWN ON PEOPLE SMUGGLING RINGS BUT IT'S VERY POLITICAL AS WELL AND THEN WE'VE JUST HEARD THEN FROM THE HOUSE OF LORDS REPORT WHEN IT COMES
TO LIBYA WITHOUT THE INVITATION FROM A STABLE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS OPERATION TO GO INTO LIBYAN WATERS HAD TO GO ON LAND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GYM WHEN YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS THE HISTORICAL DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN
TURKEY AND GREECE HAS ALWAYS GOT IN THE WAY OF THE TWO COASTGUARDS WORKING EFFECTIVELY TOGETHER TO CRACK DOWN ON PEOPLE SMUGGLERS SO NATO WAS DRAGGED INTO IT BUT EVEN SOURCE WITHIN NATO TELLS ME THERE'S PERMANENT FIGHTING BETWEEN AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL SIR DIPLOMATIC LEVELS IN THE MILITARY LEVELS OF NATO AS TO WHERE THEY CAN GET INVOLVED AS WELL THE E. WAS ALWAYS UNDERLINES THAT OPERATION SOPHIA FOR EXAMPLE IS JUST ONE PART OF THE PUZZLE YOU NEED TO ALSO LOOK AT THE ROOT CAUSES OF WHY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE JOURNEY
AND AND THAT NEEDS MONEY YOU NEED TO END WARS CONFLICTS YOU NEED TO REDUCE POVERTY AND IT'S READY THAT'S A LONGER LET ALONE LET'S DEAL WITH WHAT HIS DEAL OF ALL WITH AT THE MOMENT AND WITH THE G. IN PARTICULAR HOW BIG POTENTIAL IS THE DEAL THAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH TURKEY THAT HAS PRETTY MUCH REDUCED TO WHAT SOMETHING LIKE SIERRA THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE COMING ON THAT JOURNEY HOW BIGGER TROUBLE IS THAT IT
WELL IF YOU LISTEN TO THE TURKISH PRESIDENT AT THE MOMENT IT'S A LOT OF TROUBLE HE'S TAKEN P. MUCH EVERY DAY THIS WEEK TO THREATEN THE E.U. THE E.U. IS SAID THAT TURKEY LIKE ANY COUNTRY NEEDS TO FULFIL SEVENTY TWO DIFFERENT CRITERIA IN ORDER TO HAVE THEIR VISA REQUIREMENT LIFTED FOR THREE MONTHS AT TRAVEL AT TWO
SING AND COUNTRIES THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE TO THE UNITED KINGDOM ONE OF THESE IS THAT TURKEY HAS TO REVISE ITS ANTI TERROR LAWS THE TURKISH PRESENT HAS REACTED VERY ANGRILY ABOUT THERE SOME HAS SAID BASICALLY IF THIS IS THE CASE YOU GO YOUR WAY AND I'LL GO MINE WHAT THIS COULD MEAN OF COURSE IS THAT HE JUST TURNS ON THE TAP AGAIN KEY VOTED THEIR SUCCESS SO FAR IS NOT JUST TURKEY BUT IT'S THAT FALCON ROUTE THROUGH EUROPE WHERE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE CLOSED THEIR BORDERS THAT'S PUTTING MIGRANTS OFF TO CATCH A ADLER THANK YOU WEATHER FORECAST

HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE HAS CRITICISED THE E. USE ATTEMPTS TO TACKLE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SAYING THEY'RE MAKING MIGRANTS AND BEST SAFE OPERATION SOPHIA WAS SET UP NEARLY A YEAR AGO FOLLOWING A SERIES OF DISASTERS IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DROWNED TRYING TO REACH ITALY FROM LIBYA THE LORD'S EUROPEAN UNION COMMITTEE SAYS THAT THE MISSION IS NOT ACHIEVED ITS AIMS AND WON'T SUCCEED UNLESS CHANGES ARE MADE A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT PAUL ADAMS HAS THE DETAILS
SINCE THE FIRST PHASE OF OPERATION SOPHIA BEGAN LAST JUNE YOU SHIPS HAVE RESCUED THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE DROWNED BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THE MISSION WAS SET UP TO ACHIEVE THE IDEA WAS TO DISRUPT THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF PEOPLE TRAFFICKING INCLUDING CAPTURING AND DESTROYING SMUGGLER BOATS
BUT SO FAR THE REPORT SAYS ARRESTS HAVE BEEN OF LOW LEVEL CRIMINALS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF WOODEN VESSELS HAS SIMPLY ENCOURAGE SMUGGLERS TO PUT MIGRANTS INTO ROBERT DING IS PLACING THEM IN EVEN GREATER DANGER
THE MISSION IS STILL OPERATING OUT AT SEA AND NOT AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED INSIDE LIBYAN WATERS AS A RESULT INTELLIGENCE GATHERING IS MINIMAL THE REPORT CITES THE WEAKNESS OF THE LIBYAN STATE AS A KEY FACTOR IT'S THE SAME WEAKNESS AND THE ABSENCE OF A FORMAL INVITATION FROM LIBYA'S FRAGILE NEW GOVERNMENT THAT'S PREVENTING EUROPEAN NATO MEMBERS FROM LAUNCHING A MILITARY INTERVENTION AIMED AT TACKLING THE THREAT POSED TO LIBYA AND THE REGION BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
THE LEBANESE MILITANT GROUP HEZBOLLAH SAYS THAT ONE OF ITS MOST SENIOR COMMANDERS HAS BEEN KILLED IN SYRIA MEDIA REPORT SAME WAS STUFF ABOUT HER DEAN DIED IN AN ISRAELI AIR STRIKE ALTHOUGH THE GROUP SAYS IT STILL INVESTIGATING HAS POLARIS FIGHTING IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT ASSAD'S GOVERNMENT IN SYRIA OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT QUENTIN SOMERVILLE REPORTS FROM BEIRUT

EXPERTS FROM THE EXPLOSIVE ORDINANCE DISPOSAL TEAM HAVE SPENT THE NIGHT TRYING TO MAKE THE DEVICE SAFE THEY'RE SURROUNDING THE UNEXPLODED BOMB WITH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TONNES OF SAND TO ACT AS A BARRIER ONCE THAT'S BEEN DONE THE PLAN IS TO REMOVE THE SHELL FROM THE FORMER ROYAL HIGH SCHOOL FOR GIRLS AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE SAY THEY'LL ESCORT IT TO A SAFE LOCATION AWAY FROM THE CITY WHERE A CONTROLLED EXPLOSION WILL BE CARRIED OUT

IT'S NOT CHANGING BEHAVIOUR TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE ALL AS IT'S DOING IS CRIMINALISING OR ATTEMPTING TO CRIMINALISE PARENTS WHO'D LARGELY ARE DOING ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING AND ABIDING BY THE LAW
BUT THIS IDEA THAT THEY'VE GOT INTO THEIR HEADS THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES GOING TO THEIR HEADS THEY KNOW BETTER THAN YOU AS A PARENT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR KIDS HAS TO COME TO YOU NO

SLEEP WHEN YOUR EYES FLICKER AND DREAMS TAKE OLD WE ALREADY KNOW THAT DEEP SLEEP IS CRUCIAL FOR CONSOLIDATING MEMORIES FROM THE DAY BEFORE BUT THAT DREAMING PHASE IS UNPREDICTABLE FLEETING AND DIFFICULT TO STUDY SO RESEARCHERS USED A TINY OPTICAL FIBRE INSIDE THE BRAIN OF A SLEEPING MOUSE TO TAKE CONTROL OF A SMALL GROUP OF NEURONS
IF THEY SILENCED THOSE BRAIN CELLS DURING R.E.M. SLEEP THE MOUSE LATER FAILED TO REMEMBER SIMPLE THINGS THAT HAD LEARNED THE PREVIOUS DAY THE SCIENTISTS SAY THEY NOW WANT TO STUDY THE SAME SORT OF BRAIN ACTIVITY IN HUMANS WITH MEMORY DISORDERS
THE WORLD'S OLDEST PERSON HURST DIED IN NEW YORK AT THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN DOCTORS SAID THAT SUSANNAH MUSHER JONAS WHO WAS BORN ON A FARM IN ALABAMA IN EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE HAD BEEN ILL FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND ITALIAN WOMAN EMMA MERANO NOW TAKES THE MANTLE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST PERSON SHE IS THE ONLY LIVING PERSON VERIFIED TO HAVE BEEN BORN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT
IT'S ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO THAT THE IDEA OF CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS THREE GETTING CLINICAL TREATMENT BECAUSE THEY WERE ASSIGNED THE WRONG GENDER BERTHS WOULD HAVE BEEN GREETED WITH BEMUSEMENT THE WORD ITSELF TRANS GENDER HAD BARELY ENTERED THE VOCABULARY BUT WE MOVED A VERY LONG WAY IN A VERY SHORT TIME POSSIBLY INFLUENCED BY WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES THE LATEST DEVELOP THEM AS THE GOVERNMENT TELLING EVERY STATE SCHOOL THAT THEY MUST ALLOWED TRANS GENDER STUDENTS TO USE WHATEVER TOILET IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENDER THEY IDENTIFY WITH
HERE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING REFERRED TO THE TABLETS STOP CLINIC IN LONDON WHICH SPECIALISES IN TRANSGENIC CASES HAS DOUBLED OVER THE PAST YEAR SOME OF THEM AS YOUNG AS THREE A REPORT AT SI MC ATTACH IT IS THE FIRST JOURNALIST TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN FULL ACCESS TO THE CLINIC FOR INVITED TO TALK TO SOME OF ITS STAFF AND PATIENTS
ISN'T IT AT ALL I
GO TO MY WISHING WELL IN THE GARDEN ROOM
COLLECT SOME STAY USE AND FRED AND DOWN THE WELL AND SAY I WISH I WAS A GIRL
THAT WISH CAME TRUE NINE YEAR OLD PAPPY USED TO BE LOUIS BUT LAST DECEMBER SHE DECIDED TO GO FROM BEING A BOY TO A GIRL BIOLOGICALLY SHE REMAINS THE SAME BUT IN ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF LIFE SHE HAS TRANSITIONED INTO A SCENE
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT RIGHT
AND DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT IN SOMETHING FELT WRONG INSIDE IT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO BE LIKE THIS FOREVER
BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN THE POISON IT'S STEPH'S BUBBLE IN YOUR BOY'S A BIT STRESSFUL YEAH SO I THINK THAT EITHER
SO IT'S A WEIRD WEIRD FEELING
SO WHEN PEOPLE FIRST ARRIVE THEY MOVED
COME INTO THE RECEPTION ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S A GENDER NEUTRAL TOILET
PEAS ON A WAITING LIST TO GET INTO THIS CLINIC IN NORTH WEST LONDON THE GENDER IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT SERVICE AT THE TAV A STOCK AND PORTMAN N.H.S. TRUST IS THE ONLY CLINIC IN THE COUNTRY WHICH SUPPORTS CHILDREN WHO FEEL THERE'S A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR BIOLOGICAL SEX AND THEIR GENDER IDENTITY FOR THE FIRST TIME THE CENTRE HAS GIVEN A MEDIA OUTLET ACCESS TO THE CLINIC IT'S STAFF AND SOME OF IT
NOT THE CLINICAL ROOM AND AGAIN AS YOU CAN SEE SORT OF TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL WELCOME AND COMFORTABLE KNOWING THAT IT'S QUITE A STRESSFUL SITUATION PICTURES ON THE WALL
SOME OF THE ROOMS ARE SPARSE A TABLE A FEW CHAIRS AND THAT'S WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE ASSESSED BY PSYCHOLOGISTS PSYCHOTHERAPISTS AND DOCTORS AFTER NUMEROUS CONSULTATIONS THE CHILD CAN DECIDE TO HAVE HORMONE BLOCKERS WHICH COME IN THE FORM OF THE MONTHLY INJECTION
THEY PAUSE PUBERTY THEREFORE STOPPING THE CHILD FROM DEVELOPING AS A MAN OR A WOMAN BIOLOGICALLY ACCORDING TO FIGURES FROM THE CLINIC THIRTY TWO CHILDREN WERE INJECTED WITH BLOCKERS LAST YEAR COMPARED TO FORTY ONE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR
EVERY YOUNG PERSON WHO COMES FOR THE SERVICE IS AN INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR POLLY CARMICHAEL IS THE DIRECTOR HAIR IT'S ABOUT REALLY GETTING TO KNOW THEM AND CREATING A THERAPEUTIC SPACE WHERE IT FEELS SAFE TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE ALTERNATIVES AND CHOICES THEY MAY HAVE SOME MIGHT ARGUE THAT
YOU ARE BEHAVING IRRESPONSIBLY BY OFFERING HORMONE BLOCKERS TO CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS TWELVE
THIS IS A REAL PHENOMENON THERE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO FEEL INCREDIBLY DISTRESSED AROUND THEIR GENDER IDENTITY AND I THINK WE START FROM A PLACE WHERE WE ACCEPT THAT THAT IS REAL THAT IS TO BE RESPECTED BUT WE DON'T START FROM A PLACE WHERE WE ASSUME THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE ALL WE KNOW THE PATH THAT THAT YOUNG PERSON WILL ULTIMATELY CHOOSE
OH COOL I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL JUST TO SORT OF GO BACK A BIT AND THINK A BIT MORE IN DETAIL ABOUT YOUR GENDER IDENTITY PERHAPS COLIN IS HAVING A SESSION WITH DOCTOR VICTORIA HOLT ONE OF THE CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS HAIR HE'S NOW SIXTEEN AND TRANSITIONED FROM FEMALE TO MALE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
HE HAS NO DESIRE TO HAVE ANY SURGERY WHEN HE'S OLDER TO BIOLOGICALLY TRANSITION APART FROM ON HIS CHEST TO FLATTEN HIS BREASTS HE CURRENTLY WORDS WHAT'S CALLED A CHEST BINDER WHICH APPLIES PRESSURE OF BREAST TISSUE
IT'S EXCELLENT FOR MAKING MY CHEST LOOK FLOWER ANTHER MAKING OTHER PEOPLE PERCEIVE ME AND MY GENDER CORRECTLY BUT IT CAN ALSO CAUSE A LOT OF BACK PAIN AND IF I WEAR IT FOR TOO LONG IT CAN I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BROKEN RIBS FROM
LIKE THE CLINICIANS HAIR HE'S KEEN TO EMPHASISE THAT GENDER AND SEXUALITY ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS
WOULD YOU EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE THAT YOU FEEL MORE LIKE A MAN WHEN ACTUALLY YOU ARE BIOLOGICALLY A WOMAN
BASICALLY GENDER AS WHAT'S BETWEEN YOUR EARS NOT WHAT'S BETWEEN YOUR LEGS I FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING WITHIN YOU YOU LIKE YOUR GENDER
AND IT HAS NO RELATION TO YOUR BODY BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF LIKE LIKE WHEN I GET PERIODS THEN IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN MY BODY AND IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS A WOMAN THING THIS IS JUST A THING
AT SIXTEEN A CHILD CAN DECIDE TO TAKE CROSS SEX HORMONES TO LOOK MORE LIKE THE GENDER THEY IDENTIFY WITH AND AS AN ADULT THEY CAN OPT FOR SURGICAL INTERVENTION TO CRITICS THIS IS MESSING WITH NATURE BUT STAFF HERE SAY EACH CASE IS DIFFERENT AND THAT THE MEDIA HAS CREATED AN ILLUSION THAT THIS IS HAPPENING ON A MASS SCALE WHEN ACTUALLY IT'S ONLY OCCURRING IN A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION
LOGICALLY WOULD SEEM EASIER TO SORT OF CONTINUE MY LIFE LIKE AS A WOMAN BUT THAT ISN'T WHO I AM I AM HAPPIER LIKE THIS THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN
A LOT HAPPIER AND LESS WORRIED ABOUT THINGS LIKE WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY
WHAT WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING WHEN YOU'RE A BOY
THEY MAKE FUN THE ME SAD CHASEY CHASEY GIRL AND IN DAYLIGHT NEW MANA HE LIKE ME
LOOK AT HER CHURCH WAS REPORTING FROM THE TAVISTOCK CLINIC AND I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU HEARD IN THAT REPORT COLIN WHO
BUT WHAT ABOUT TRANS WHITTON HIMSELF MADE THE CHANGE FROM A WOMAN WHEN HE WAS FOURTEEN AND HIS MOTHER JANE EVENS AND ALSO BY BERNADETTE WREN WHO IS THE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AT THE TERMS JEAN COMPORTMENT N.H.S. FOUNDATION TRUST COLIN JUST TO PURSUE A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU SAID
IN THAT REPORT YOU DECIDED NOT TO AND I THINK YOU USE THE EXPRESSION COME OUT UNTIL YOU WERE FOURTEEN BEFORE YOU WERE FOURTEEN HOW CONSCIOUS WERE YOU OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO YOU
FOR THE MOST PART IT WASN'T ANYTHING THAT CAME UP LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD ALWAYS TORTURING ME IT WAS SORT OF SOMETHING THAT LIKE MY MUM WAS SAYING LIKE AROUND THE AGE OF THREE ASKED FOR A SEX CHANGE BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO ME UNTIL I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN AND THEN I SORT OF WAS DISCOVERING THE THE SORT OF WORLD OF GENDER AND SORT OF CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I IDENTIFIED WITH
THE PEOPLE I SAW LIKE ON THE INTERNET BUT BUT YOU WEREN'T DURING THOSE YEARS DURING YOUR EARLY YEARS YOU WEREN'T GOING THROUGH BUT CAN ANY KIND OF HELLISH EXISTENCE YOU WEREN'T SUFFERING IN ANY REAL SENSE NO NOT AT ALL EH I WAS PERFECT TOWN I WAS WEARING LIKE MOSTLY BOYS CLOTHES BUT IT WASN'T SOMETHING WHERE WHENEVER SOMEONE REFERRED TO ME BY THE NAME OF PRONOUNS I WAS USING ABOUT TIME THEN IT WOULD LIKE IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME THAT MUCH AT THE TIME AND JANE WHAT WAS WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS GOING ON
WHEN COLIN WAS YOUNGER I JUST ASSUMED HE WAS A TOMBOY AT I'VE BEEN QUITE A TOMBOY KIND OF CHILD WE WEREN'T A SORT OF PINK FLUFFY HOUSEHOLD SO THE FACT HE WAS WEARING BOY'S CLOTHES YOU KNOW DIDN'T SEEM ANYTHING OUT OF THE THE ORDINARY REALLY
AND WHEN HE REALISED THAT IT WAS AS IT WERE OUT OF THE ORDINARY FOR USUALLY SPECIAL WHEN HE WAS FOURTEEN AND SPOKE TO ME YOU KNOW IT'S THAT KIND OF MUM CAN I TALK TO YOU IN A VERY SERIOUS VOICE AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I SORT OF QUESTIONING MY GENDER AND
I THINK AREN'T I I'M A BOY AND HOW DID YOU REACT TO THAT
TRY TO SAY CALM YOU KNOW AS A PARENT ONE TRIES NOT TO OVER REACT TO THINGS YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE PERHAPS I HAVE SOME ADVANTAGE OVER SOME PARENTS WE LIVE IN BRIGHTON AND SO WE HAVE A QUITE AN ECLECTIC RANGE OF PEOPLE IN BRIGHTON ALREADY BUT YEAH I THINK I'VE ALWAYS MY PARENTING STYLE HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A KIND OF YES O.K. BUT HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE CONSEQUENCES KIND OF RESPONSE AND IT WAS THE SAME WITH THAT SO
I THINK I WAS REACTED FAIRLY CALMLY BUT THEN ONCE YOU FINISH TALKING TO THEM YOU GO AWAY AND CRY BUCKETS OH YOU DID CRY YEAH OBVIOUSLY I MEAN IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'D CHOOSE FOR YOUR CHILD TO DO NOBODY WANTS ANYTHING I THINK WITH THEIR CHILD'S GOING TO BE SINGLED OUT OR TREATED DIFFERENTLY
SO IT'S CHALLENGING AND IT'S VERY UPSETTING AND YOU ASK YOURSELF ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU KNOW IS A PHASE OF THE ATTENTION SEEKING IS IT SOMETHING I'VE DONE YOU GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT BUT I THINK AS ANYTHING
TICKLEY WERE TEENAGERS BUT CHILDREN OF ANY AGE IF YOU CAN KEEP THE DIALOGUE OPEN KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT I'M LUCKY THAT COLIN'S VERY HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE ISSUES AROUND HIM HOW HE'S FEELING SO TO ME IT'S JUST I WANT TO SUPPORT MY CHILD AND YOU DIDN'T TRY TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT NO
I MEAN WE TALKED AROUND THE SUBJECT BUT NO
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TALKED OUT OF IT COLIN NOT AT ALL I THINK IF ANYONE TRIED TO TALK ME OUT OF IT WE WERE JUST MADE ME WANT TO PROVE THEM WRONG EVEN MORE TO BE HONEST
IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A VERY DETERMINED YOUNG MAN THAT'S THAT'S CLEAR HAVE HAVING MET YOU
IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES BUT IT BUT WAS THERE ANY MOMENT OF ANY SUGGESTION THAT PERHAPS IN YOUR OWN MIND THAT PERHAPS YOU WERE DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO BE A BIT DIFFERENT AND BECAUSE YOU WERE
MAY BE QUITE SURE BUT THAT THAT IT WASN'T THAT PRESSING AND YOU OR HAVE I GOT THAT COMPLETELY WRONG
I THINK THAT IF I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FOR ATTENTION THEN THERE'S PLENTY OF THINGS I COULD HAVE DONE FOR ATTEMPTING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE EASY AND A LOT LESS EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY PAINFUL SO IT HAS BEEN
PAINFUL FOR YOU YEAH OF COURSE LIKE IT'S NOT EASY AT ALL LIKE I
I'M INCREDIBLY LUCKY ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE SCHOOL I GO TO IS VERY GOOD NO PROBLEM WITH YOUR FRIENDS AT ALL NOT AT ALL THE LAW AT THE SAME TIME LIKE THE STATISTICS ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE HAVING SHORTER LIFE'S STANDS COS OF SUICIDE OR MURDER OR SO MANY DIFFERENT PREJUDICES THAT I KIND OF TERRIFIED ABOUT EXPERIENCING LIKE AS AN ADULT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M STILL HAPPIER LIKE THIS AND I'D RATHER GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT
THAN TO BE LIVING MY LIFE AS A WOMAN AND BE HATING IT IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY DO YOU THINK AND HOW WOULD YOU KNOW I REALISE IT'S A VERY ODD PROBABLY AN IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION BUT YOU MIGHT GO BACK AGAIN TRENDS AGAIN I I HIGHLY DOUBT IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT SORT OF
IF THIS IS HOW I'M FEELING NOW I WANT TO RESPOND TO MY CURRENT FEELINGS AND IF FOR SOME REASON AND IN A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE THAT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG THEN I CAN DO IT ALL AGAIN AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT HAVING ANY SURGICAL TREATMENT ALL CLINICAL TREATMENT WHILE OUT HAVING HOMER BLOCKERS I AM NOT TAKING WOMAN BLOCKERS BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME LIKE IT DOESN'T AFFECT ME THAT MUCH
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE COMMENTS LIKE FOR THEIR VOICE AND THE RIGHT SORT OF VARIOUS THINGS AND FOR ME IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME RIGHT BERNADETTE REN YOU'RE THE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AS I SAID HOW TYPICAL INNIT THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD IS COLIN
I THINK BECAUSE THEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME SAYING YOU'RE YOU'RE TYPICAL OF IN SOME RESPECTS
A NEW WAVE OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO US WHO I THINK ARE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASE IN NUMBERS I THINK WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO COME OUT AND SPEAK FRANKLY TO TRANSITION EVEN TO HAVE MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS WHEN THAT'S LESS KNOWN ABOUT YOU TEND TO GET
PROBABLY THE GROUP THAT YOU EXPECTED TO HEAR ABOUT SO A CORE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY REALLY STRUGGLING REALLY IN INK IN PATE PSYCHOLOGICALLY IN PAIN AND I'M ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE AS ARE THEIR PARENTS I THINK WHEN THE THING IS OPENED UP MY NEW YOURSELF COLIN SAID THAT WHEN YOU BEGAN TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY YOU CAN
HAVE MORE FREEDOM IN A WORLD THAT SEEMS TO BE VERY SETTLED WITH CLEAR GENDER CATEGORIES MALE OR FEMALE ACTUALLY THERE'S NOT A LOT STOPPING YOU FROM CHALLENGING THAT A BIT I THINK THAT HAS BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A WIDER RANGE OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD AND BEGIN TO ASK
AS COLIN IS WHETHER THE FUTURE RELIES IN GOING DOWN ANOTHER GENDERED ROUTE FOR SOME OF THEM THAT REALLY MEANS LIVING
AS WHAT WE USED TO CALL THERE SO NOW THE OPPOSITE SEX FOR OTHERS IT MEANS EXPLORING PERHAPS IN BETWEEN POSITION OR JUST SAYING THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW AT THE MOMENT BUT THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE STAYING IN THE INITIAL
QUITE CLEAR A CATEGORY OF OF MALE OR FEMALE AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO MIGHT ARGUE THAT
FOR MANY MANY FOREVER THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN RELATIVELY UNHAPPY ABOUT WHAT BUT WAS HOW THEY WERE BORN BUT THEY'D HAVE JUST GOT ON WITH IT IN THE END THEY'VE GOT USED TO THE IDEA AND PERHAPS THEY'D HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF GETTING USED TO THE IDEA
WELL I CERTAINLY THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT ACROSS HISTORY AND ACROSS CULTURES THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CORE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE IDENTIFIED AS THE OTHER GENDER OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN WE JUST KNOW THAT AND LOGICAL AND HISTORICAL RESEARCH
WHETHER OR NOT I MEAN JOHN YOU COULD ARGUE THAT ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY GET A GRIP AND I'M LIVE WITH I DIDN'T FUCKING ARTHUR'LL ANCONA GETS THAT THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE PUT UP WITH A BIT MAIR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR LOSING THEIR CHILDREN TELL YOUR LITTLE HIDES IT ALL EVEN AS WELL MY CRIMINAL ABUSE OF WELL I'M NOT SURE IT WON'T NO I TECH ARE YOU SET AN EXAMPLE WAS AT ONE TIME THAT WAS CULTURALLY SANCTIONED THAT MEN HAD POWER OVER WOMEN FOR EXAMPLE
AND I THINK NOW WE ARE BEGINNING IN A PRIVILEGE SOCIETY WERE BEGINNING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO EXERCISE MORE FREEDOM THE PEOPLE SIMPLY HAVE MORE ELBOW ROOM TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO LIVE THEIR LIVES NOW YES PEOPLE COULD
AS PEOPLE DID IN THE PAST JUST TRY TO MAKE THE BEST ADVERT AND LIVE THEIR LIVES BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE FEEL THAT THAT'S NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE NOW IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN DO FOR THEMSELVES IT DOESN'T REALLY HARM OTHER PEOPLE IT ENABLES PEOPLE TO LIVE FULLER LIVES I THINK THAT'S A CERTAINLY OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE CLINIC THE MAJORITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY OR MORE OF COLIN'S EXPERIENCE OF BEING QUITE ADAPTABLE
IF THEY MAKE THE TRANSITION AND THEY MAKE A GO OF IT THERE LIVES A FULLER RICHER AND MORE REWARDING ANIMAL PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE BERNADETTA EN JANE AND COLIN THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH INDEED

JAIL ARE GETTING SENT BACK TO A COUNTRY THAT PERSECUTE YOU THE FATE OF UNREGISTERED WRECKING WOMEN WHO SEEK JUSTICE
YET MANY SAY THEY'D RATHER LIVE A DIFFICULT LIFE HERE THEN GO BACK TO ME AND MA
HONEY THE BEGUM WAS NEARLY TRAFFIC BUT SHE REFUSES TO BE SEEN AS A VICTIM
BANG A VISION OF A HUNGER THAT CANNOT I WANT TO ASK BANGLADESH WHY THEY DON'T RESPECT LOOKING DOWN THIS BIT ALL OF THESE HIT US EVEN A SMALL CHILD WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE ENJOYING THAT AND YOU HAVE NO VALUE I WANT RESPITE AS USUAL KINGA IN BANGLADESH AND I WANT THEM I WANT HER KEPT COD
A REPORT FROM THE BORDER BETWEEN BANGLADESH AND MY MOTHER TIME NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE GRAFFITI ON A CAVE WALL SAVED FOR THE NATION WE WERE HEARING WELL AN HOUR OR SO GO IN THE PROGRAMME ABOUT A PROJECT TO SAVE GRAFFITI ON THE WALLS AT RICHMOND CASTLE IN NORTH YORKSHIRE THEY GETTING LOTTERY FUND MONEY IT'S ALL VERY OFFICIAL AND PROPER
SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD INVESTIGATE THE BUSINESS OF SAVING GRAFFITI FOR THE NATION WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A GOOD IDEA WELL NOT SO MUCH WHETHER IT'S A GOOD IDEA WE'D ASSUME WITH THE NORTH YORKSHIRE GRAFFITI THAT IT IS A GOOD IDEA BUT ALSO MORE GENERALLY WHETHER OR NOT IT IS WHY IS THAT MONEY IS SPENT ON THE EFFECT THAT THE SUGGESTION THAT GRAFFITI IS NOW
WELL MUCH MORE RESPECTABLE THAN IT USED TO BE JOINING ME IN THE STUDIO AS WELL DIDN'T DESCRIBE YOURSELF YOU'RE BUT THIS KIND OF PROFESSOR A GRAFFITI KIND OF ART HISTORIAN DIGITAL HUMANITIES EXPERT BELIEVE IT OR NOT
WE'RE JOINED AS WELL ON THE LIONESS I'M HOPING WE'RE GOING TO BE JOINED ON THE LINE IN JUST A SECOND BY SOMEONE WHOM DOES GRAFFITI FOR A LIVING BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT HE'S THERE LET'S JUST CHECK THE B. IT'S GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES I'VE GOT WONDERFUL WONDERFUL O.K. LET'S LET'S START WITH THE BUSINESS
OF THE RESPECTABILITY OF GRAFFITI BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS CHANGED HASN'T IT WELL REALLY IN IN REASONABLY RECENT ORDER AND RICHARD WILSON YOG THERE THE PERSON ON THE LINE IN LEICESTER YOU'VE YOU'VE KIND OF IT HAVE USED TO HAVE YOU SEEN IN THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
A GRAFFITI ARTIST A CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT WE REGARD IT UM TO BE HONEST NO NOT REALLY IT DEPENDS ON THE SUBJECT MATTER
I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE I'M IN LEICESTER AT THE MOMENT PAINTING ME ALL OF THE OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM YOU'VE JUST WON THE LEAGUE AND
THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN NO NEGATIVITY AT ALL COMPLETE OPPOSITE IN FACT POLICE EVEN COMING TO THE WARD TO CONGRATULATE ME AND SAY HOW AMAZING IT IS AND THANKS FOR COMING TO DO THIS
SO A POLAR OPPOSITE REALLY TO WHAT I WOULD CALL TRADITIONAL GRAFFITI WHICH I THINK IS STILL REGARDED AS AN AS AN EYESORE
IS IT SO SO NOT FOR ME PERSONALLY BUT I THINK FOR THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC YES
IS THAT TRUE DO YOU THINK RICHARD CROWE PROFESSOR CROAK PLAY THAT THERE IS THAT WE MAKE A DISTINCTION
BETWEEN GRAFFITI THAT IS RESPECTABLE AND GRAFFITI THAT IS YEAH I THINK IT ABSOLUTELY IS TRUE AND IT VARIES A LOT ACTUALLY AS YOU GO ACROSS DIFFERENT CITIES IN THE U.K. AND ACROSS EUROPE DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES HAVE VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS AND DIFFERENT POPULATIONS WITHIN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES HAVE VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS FOR AS MANY INTERPRETATIONS OF A PIECE OF GRAFFITI AND SLOPPY POLICE
BUT IS IT PARTLY JUST THE UGLINESS OF WHAT IS ON A WAR AND IF YOU OWN A PLACE AND IT'S A NEW AND IT FEELS AS IF THE PLACE HAS BEEN DEFACED YOU'LL FEEL BAD ABOUT IT IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WERE TALKING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME BUT DRAWINGS ON THE WALL IN A CASTLE THAT ARE BEEN PRESERVED AND I THINK IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO BE ATTRACTIVE AND INTERESTING THEN YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE INTERESTING THING IS HOW DOES IT COME TO BE THE CASE AT SOMETHING THAT WAS REGARDED AS AN EXTREMELY UGLY IS WORTHY OF PRESERVATION LOOK AT THE REICHSTAG
IN BERLIN LOOK AT THEIR POST WAR GRAFFITI STRAIGHT AFTER THE CAPITULATION OF THE NAZIS SCRAWLED WITH RUSSIAN SOLDIERS GRAFFITI AND WHEN NORMA FOSTER COMES TO PRESERVE THE BUILDING THE FRONT TO START I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PRESERVE IT OR NOT AND SOME OF IT'S REALLY OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE REALLY AGGRESSIVE
AND THE M.P.S DECIDE ACTUALLY WE DO NEED TO REMEMBER THIS IT'S NOT ABOUT WHETHER IT'S PRETTY OR NOT IT'S ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'S HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT
RICHARD WILSON IS WHAT YOU DO IT HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT
THE STUFF I'M DOING AT THE MOMENT I WOULD SAY YES ESPECIALLY THE MURAL AND I'M PAINTING LESTER AT THE MOMENT PARTICULARLY COS OF WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE WITH THE FOOTBALL TEAM THIS YEAR SO POTENTIALLY THIS WALL'S GOING TO BE HERE FOREVER
SO YEAH IT IS IT DOES HAVE SOME HISTORIC IMPACT DEFINITELY
AND DO YOU DO YOU SAY THAT YOU HAD A VERY GOOD TO YOU DO YOU GRILL SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE IN LEICESTER FLUNG BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING AN INTEREST IN IT IS THAT IS THAT PART OF IT THAT ACTUALLY IF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY FEEL PART OF WHAT YOU ARE SPRAYING ON A WALL
THEN YOU GET MUCH MORE THAN IF YOU'D JUST I DON'T KNOW YOU SPRING SOMETHING AND PEOPLE ARE WALKING PAST AND WHY YOU'RE DOING IT AND AND FEEL THAT IT'S THAT IT'S NOT PART OF THAT THE THE ULTIMATE EXAMPLE OF IT PROBABLY IS ON THIS WALL THAT I'M PAINTING WHICH IS PROBABLY SIXTEEN METRES WIDE
BEFORE I EVEN STARTED PAINTING MY THING ON IT WHICH IS BASICALLY PORTRAITS OF THE PLAYERS
SOMEONE HAS COME AND DONE A GRAFFITI TAG SO TYPICAL YOU KNOW NOT SON SO WAS HERE BUT JUST THERE THERE TAG NAME LIKE SUBWAY A STYLE GRAFFITI
SO PEOPLE WILL WALK PAST AND SAY TO ME INCREDIBLE THINGS ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING AND SAY UP FOR LOOK AT THAT THING THERE
AND SO I FIND THAT FASCINATING BECAUSE REALLY THAT'S JUST SUBJECTIVE SOMEONE MIGHT LIKE THAT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM
UM WELL I I ACTUALLY LIKE THAT KIND OF STUFF ANYWAY COS THAT'S THE BACKGROUND I COME FROM SO EVEN IF IT'S JUST A SCHOOL ON A WALL IF I SEE THAT I'M KIND OF INTERESTED IN IT AND I DID YEAH I JUST FIND IT INTERESTING TO LOOK AT ANYWAY SO I DON'T FIND IT UGLY BUT I JUST TRIED
TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE POSITIVITY ABOUT IT SO THEY TO WORK SUCCESSFULLY WE HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS I DO I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A POLICE LADY THERE YESTERDAY AND I WAS SAYING TO I FIND IT FASCINATING THE FINE LINE THAT I MEAN I HAVE PERMISSION TO DO THIS WALL BUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IF I PICK UP MY SPRAY CANS AND GO TO ANOTHER WALL AND JUST START TO PAINT A FACE RANDOMLY WHICH EVERYONE SAID TO ME THEY LOVE HERE
BUT IF I JUST WENT AND DID IT SOMEWHERE ELSE I COULD GET ARRESTED BY THE SAME POLICE WOMAN WHO JUST TELLING ME FIVE MINUTES AGO SHE LOVES WERE UNDOING WHICH THEN RAISES THE ISSUE PROFESSOR CLAY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE AS A SOCIETY MORE RELAX NOW OR NOT MORE RELAXED NOW THAT GRAFFITI
I'D BE INCLINED TO SAY WE DO SEEM TO BE BECOMING MORE RELAXED THE ARRESTS ARE LESS FREQUENT THEY ARE PROBABLY A AND THERE'S LESS OUTRAGE IN THE PRESS NOWADAYS
BUT IT WAS FILMING LAST SUMMER IN PARIS AND COMING OUT IN FIGURE FIGARO ON THE FRONT PAGE THERE'S A CONDEMNATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF GRAFFITI AND HOW DISGUSTING IT IS YOU LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPER WALK DOWN THE STREET AND THERE'S ALL THIS STREET UP THIS TANKS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND IT'S VERY TOLERANT SO IT REALLY REALLY DOES BUT VARY ACROSS COMMUNITIES
DO YOU FEEL RICHARD WILSON AT THE RESIDENTS SORT OF BROADLY A KIND OF FEELING THAT WHAT YOU DO IS NOW VALUED IN A WAY THAT IT WAS
DEFINITELY WHAT I'M DOING NOW I FEEL IT'S VALUED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN OVERWHELMED BY THE COMMENTS I HAD A GUY YESTERDAY CAME WITH HIS FAMILY HE WAS IN TEARS LOOKING AT IT I MEAN IT'S INCREDIBLE BUT I MEAN GENERALLY
I THINK THERE'S A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES YOU'VE GOT STREET ART AND GRAFFITI
AND I DON'T THINK GRAFFITI ART WHICH TO ME IS TAGGING AND LETTERS AND LETTERING WHERE IT'S ON A SUBWAY TRAIN ON WOLVES IS IS GENERALLY ILLEGAL AND
I THINK THERE ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO WHICH WILL BE ACCEPTED AND ONE NOT AND ONE STILL NOT RICHARD THANKS VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THANK YOU THANKS AS WELL TO PROFESSOR RICHARD CLAY FROM UNIVERSITY
IT IS NOW SIX MINUTES TO NINE AND WE SPENT A LARGE PART OF THIS PROGRAMME TALKING ABOUT GENDER THE GROWING AMOUNT OF ATTENTION WE GIVE TO PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN MALE BUT IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS FEMALE OR VICE VERSA TRANS GENDER PEOPLE IT'S BECOME A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE IN THE UNITED STATES TO THE EXTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON HAS WRITTEN TO THE PRINCIPLES OF ALL STATE SCHOOLS TELLING THEM THEY MUST ALLOWED TRANS STUDENTS TO USE TOILETS ASSIGNED TO THE GENDER WITH WHICH THEY IDENTIFIED HOW SHOULD TEACHERS DEAL WITH
TRANS PUPILS HAVE BEEN DE DEAL WITH IS THE RIGHT PHRASE ANYWAY LET'S PUT THAT QUESTION TO CLIVE ALISON WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CHRISTIAN TEACHERS AND TO STEPHANIE HURST RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCASTER WHO STEPHANIE YOU
CAME BACK TO THE RADIO A YEAR AFTER YOU HAD TRANSITION FROM A MAN TO A WOMAN WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU DOING THAT
OH GOOD MORNING YEAH IT WAS IT WAS QUITE EMOTIONAL ACTUALLY BECAUSE I DO HAVING BEEN ON THE RADIO FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND THEN GETTING BACK BEHIND A MICROPHONE IN MY VOICE CHANGING WHEN YOU WEAR THE HEADPHONES YOU HEAR YOUR VOICE COME IN IT WAS RATHER STRANGE BUT ACTUALLY VERY EMOTIONAL AND FINALLY FELT LIKE I WAS MY TRUE SELF AND HOW OLD ARE YOU
WHEN I CAME BACK TO RADIO IT WAS SLASH YOURSELVES THIRTY NINE RIGHT SO YOU'D HAD A LONG TIME LIVING AS AS A MAN YES AND HOW
WHEN DID YOU BECOME AWARE THAT THAT YOU WEREN'T IN YOUR EYES A MAN OF VERY EARLY ON I KNEW FROM A VERY EARLY AGE MAYBE FOUR YEARS OLD SO REALLY THAT BRICK HAD BEEN SAYING TO MY MUM THAT I WASN'T A BOY AND SHE'D MENTIONED THIS TO SOMEONE SHE WORKED WITH AND THEY CAME TO ME ACTUALLY AFTER I TRANSITIONED PUBLICLY AND SAID THAT I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH YOUR MUM WHEN YOU WERE REALLY YOUNG AND THEN I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS AND I CAME OUT TO MY MUM WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN
PARENTING WAS VERY DIFFERENT BACK THEN AND WE JUST TEND TO BRUSH THINGS UNDER THE CARPET WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THINGS YOU JUST KIND OF GOT ON WITH IT BUT THESE DAYS THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES IN SCHOOL
IT'S REALLY BADLY VERY EFFEMINATE UM REALLY WANTED TO BE WITH THE GIRLS INSTEAD OF BEING WITH THE BOYS AND DIDN'T REALLY EXCEL AT SPORT
DID YOU DO THAT ACCUSED OF BEING GAY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OH YES YES AND EVERYONE JUST ASSUMED I WAS I WAS GAY AND THEN I TRIED A TEAR TRIES A CUT OLDER TRIED TO BUTCH IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND TRY TO BE
TO BE MORE MANLY BUT IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T WORK SO IN THE END YOU HAD THE ABSOLUTELY CLIVE ALLISON WHAT HOLE SHOULD
STEPHANIE HAD BEEN TREATED IN SCHOOL WELL GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING YES IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT AREA FOR SCHOOLS AND ONE THAT IS INCREASINGLY THERE AND MY ADVICE WHEN SCHOOL'S CONTACT ME IS THAT FIRST OF ALL THEY NEED TO CONTACT THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER FOR THE AREA BECAUSE TEACHERS HEAD TEACHERS AND NOT EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA THEY'RE NOT CLINICIANS AND
IF A CHILD PRESENTS AS TRANS GENDER THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THEIR SCHOOL LIFE AND POLICIES NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE IN THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER FOR THE LOCAL AREA IS THE BEST PERSON TO ADVISE THE SCHOOL WONDER WHAT SORT OF POLICIES
WELL IT'S ALL TO DO AS WAS JUST BEING SAID BY STEPHANIE WE WANT TO AVOID BULLYING OF ANY CHILD IN SCHOOL AND HOW DO WE DO THAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT IS IT THAT WE SHOULD BE ACCEPTING AND SCHOOLS WHERE ARE OUR FIRST PLACE OF COURSE IS TO EDUCATE AND THERE ARE PRACTICAL THINGS AS WELL LIKE THE TOILET
THE LETTER THAT'S GONE OUT OVERNIGHT PRETTY MUCH TO EVERY SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES YES AND I WOULD ACTUALLY DISAGREE WAS THAT IN THIS COUNTRY I MEAN I DON'T THINK IT'S A PRACTICAL SOLUTION OR A SOLUTION THAT MOST CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD WANT IN FACT BECAUSE TOILETS IN SCHOOLS ARE NOT THE BEST PLACE IS AT THE BEST OF TIMES AND STAFF HAVE DIFFICULTY IN LOOKING AFTER THEM AND WE DON'T WANT TO COMPLICATE THAT ISSUE WE CAN FIND OTHER WAYS ROUND IT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT STUFF
I THINK IT CAN COMPLICATE THINGS ACTUALLY IN SCHOOLS BECAUSE AS AS CLIVE WAS SAYING WE ALL KNOW US WHEN WE WENT TO SCHOOL OURSELVES WHAT'S THE TOILETS CAN BE LIKE GETTING YOUR HEAD FLUSHED DOWN THE TOILET SEVERE BULLYING WHEN WHEN TEACHERS ARE NOT AROUND SO YEAH I KIND OF TEND TO AGREE WITH CLIVE MY LITTLE SO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
WHAT DID YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT WENT WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL AND I DID HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BUT I KEPT IT TO MYSELF AS I MENTIONED TO START WITH I DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT I DID I'D SPOKE TO A FEW FRIENDS BUT NOTHING REALLY WITH ME COMING OUT PUBLICLY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I ATTEND OR JUST TO BOTTLE IT ALL UP INSIDE BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT TIME BUT BULLIED VERY BADLY AT SCHOOL CLUB IS THERE SOMETHING THAT'S GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION NOW IN SCHOOL
IT'S GETTING ATTENTION BECAUSE IT'S ON THINGS LIKE EASTENDERS AND WE DO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HERE BECAUSE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF TRANSCEND TO CHILDREN IF UNTREATED
CHOOSE NOT TO FOLLOW THAT LIFESTYLE AFTER PUBERTY AND SO WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BUT THOSE FEW PER CENT ARE THE VERY IMPORTANT ONE THROUGH TO CONTINUE WITH THAT LIFESTYLE IN THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO INVOLVE THE MEDICAL OFFICER TO ASHORE THEY ARE SUPPORTED AND IS THAT A PROBLEM YOU THINK WHETHER WHETHER TO DEAL WHETHER TO DEAL WITH IT AT ALL IN A SENSE ME
I THINK IT CAN BE A PROBLEM BUT IF A CHICK IF A CHILD HAS TRANSLUCENT TRANSITION AT SCHOOL I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO USE THE TOILETS OF THEIR CHOSEN GENDER I THINK THAT'S REALLY MUST JUST SAY THAT ANDY AND EVERY WAY BE TREATED AS THEIR NEW GEN SILLY ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED AND TEN PER CENT SHOULD BE TREATED AND RESPECTED AS THEIR CHURSTON GENT AND WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO MAY BE BAFFLED BY IT SOME OF THEM
I THINK CHILDREN THESE DAYS ARE MORE AWARE ABOUT AROUND GENDER THEY TALK MORE THAN THEY LOOK ON YOUTUBE DAY FOLLOW PEOPLE'S FLOGS I WELL CHILDREN THESE DAYS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE AWARE WE'VE TRIED TO BRING AWARENESS TO IT THIS MORNING BERNARD STEPHANIE DRIVE US AND THANK YOU BOTH THAT'S EVER LAST JO MOORE'S AND JONATHAN HARVEY I EDITORS FROM DOMINIC MORNING
