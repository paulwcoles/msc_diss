IS A PETER BOWS AND PETER PERHAPS NOT SO SURPRISING THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG WINNERS OF THE NIGHT NO I THINK I'VE PEOPLE EXPECTED IT TO DO WELL THEY'RE GOOD BRITISH SUCCESS OF COURSE THE BRITISH SUCCESS
ED SHEERAN SONG OF THE YEAR FOR THINKING OUT LOUD MOSTLY AMERICANS THOUGH I THINK DOMINATING IN THE THE OTHER CATEGORIES TAYLOR SWIFT ONE THE TOP CATEGORY ALBUM OF THE YEAR FOR HER ALBUM NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE FIRST WOMAN TO WIN IN THIS CATEGORY TWICE THE BEST NEW ARTIST WAS MEGAN TRAINER WHO'S PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR THE SONG ALL ABOUT THAT BASE AND KENDRICK LAMAR THE AMERICAN
RAPPER BORN THE MOST GRAMMYS ON THE NIGHT FIVE OUT OF HIS ELEVEN NOMINATIONS FOR HIS RAP SONG OR RIGHT AMONGST OTHERS AND THAT IS THE TRACK WHICH HAS BECOME AN ANTHEM FOR THE BLACK LIVES MUTTER MOVEMENT OFTEN OFTEN SOME OF THEIR STORIES OF THE NIGHT COME FROM THEIR PERFORMANCES AND WHAT HAPPENS WAS
ANYTHING FROM THE STAGE ITSELF THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT WELL YEAH I MEAN I THINK THE ABSOLUTE HIGHLIGHT WAS LADY GARGLE TRIBUTE TO DAVID BOWIE A NUMBER OF ARTISTS MUSICIANS WHO'VE PASSED AWAY OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THERE WERE TRIBUTES TO THEM BUT THE BAY OF DAVID BOWIE ONE I THINK WAS THE ONE THAT WILL CERTAINLY BE MAKING
HEADLINES FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO A VERY COLOURFUL ECLECTIC KIND OF PERFORMANCE SHE APPEARED DRESSED AS ZIGGY STARDUST COMPLETE WITH NEWLY DYED RED HAIR AND SHE WAS SINGING THIS LONG MEDLEY OF SPACE ODDITY CHANGES AS ZIGGY STARDUST THAT I'VE MENTIONED REBEL REBEL FOAM LET'S SEE I THINK IT REALLY WAS A FITTING TRIBUTE TO THE
CREATIVE SKILLS OF DAVID BOWIE AND SHE GOT A STANDING OVATION AT THE END OF IT A LONG LIST OF WINNERS THERE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF AWARDS IN IN THIS CEREMONY WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU PICK UP
O.K. WELL I'LL PICK SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE EXPECTING JIMMY CARTER THE THIRTY NINTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAME A TWO TIME GRAMMY WINNER AT NINETY ONE YEARS OLD WINNING FOUR BEST SPOKEN WORD ALBUM FOR A FULL LIFE REFLECTIONS AT NINETY WHICH IS THE AUDIO VERSION OF HIS MEMOIR THESE AWARDS AREN'T JUST ABOUT MUSIC THERE ABOUT RECORDINGS
THE STUFF WE'LL GET MORE FROM YOU LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THANKS VERY MUCH WE HAVE JIMMY CARTER ON THE PROGRAMME NOT IT WILL BE BEFORE THEN ANYWAY THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER PAST SIX WE'RE GETTING A NEW NUCLEAR POWER PLANT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD AND FAT WE KEEP BEING TOLD IT JOE WHEN IT KEEPS BEING DELAYED AND NOW THERE'S ANOTHER DELAY YES THEY WERE DUE TO DISCUSS THE E.D.F. WAS TO BUILD AT HINKLEY POINT IN SOMERSET
THEY WERE DUE TO DISCUSS AT THE BOARD MEETING THIS WEEK BUT THEY DIDN'T APPARENTLY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THE RESULTS IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR OR SO BUT THE EIGHTEEN BILLION POUND POWER PLANT HAS ALREADY BEEN TEN YEARS IN THE PLANNING AND IT LOOK LIKE A DONE DEAL LAST OCTOBER WHEN CHINA AGREED TO COVER A THIRD OF THE COST OF THE PROJECT E.D.F.'S INVESTMENT MANY THOUGHT WOULD BE A FORMALITY
BUT LAST MONTH'S BOARD MEETING FAILED TO APPROVE THE PROJECT AMID REPORTS OF FUNDING PROBLEMS SO COULD THE HINKLEY POWER PLANT NOT HAPPEN AFTER ALL PAUL DORFMAN IS AT THE ENERGY INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON AND JOINS US FROM PARIS GOOD MORNING PAUL GOOD MORNING
WHAT'S WITH THE DELAY THIS TIME DO YOU THINK WE'RE SEE CILLA V. AS THEY SAY IN IN PARIS UM UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE BEST IN THE WORLD IT
IT MAY JUST NOT HAPPEN CHRIS BACK AND THE MAN CHARGED BY E.D.F. TO CONSTRUCT A FEW POINTERS QUIT
SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIS FAMILY IDIOT SHARES HAVE CRASHED TO HALF THE VALUE A YEAR AGO
THE BADGE IT QUAINTLY ALONE IS BIGGER THAN E.D.S. ENTIRE MARKET VALUE SO THERE'S A GENUINE QUESTION MARK AS TO WHETHER THIS HUGE PROJECT ONE OF THE BIGGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT IN BRITAIN WILL EVER GO AHEAD
THERE'S A VERY REAL THERE'S A VERY REAL CONCERN A REIVER THAT'S YOU GUESS CONSTRUCTION HAVE BEEN BANKRUPTED BY THE HUGE COSTS AND TIME OVERRUNS FORKFUL FOR THE THE SAME BRAND OF REACTOR THEY WANT TO BUILD AT HINCKLEY SO IT IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT IT IT SIMPLY MAY NOT HAPPEN
BUT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF POLITICAL WILL IN PARIS AND LONDON FOR THIS TO HAPPEN OBVIOUSLY E.D.F. ELECTRICITY DIVORCE IS OWNED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT TO PUT ANY OF ITS OWN MONEY INDIRECTLY AND SO THE POLITICAL WILL MAY SAY THAT YES THIS PROJECT NEEDS TO GO AHEAD EVEN IF IT MEANS THAT IT'S FINANCIALLY NOT THE BEST
NOT THE BEST I MEAN WE ARE QUITE LITERALLY BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO TO TO DOLE OUT MONEY IN TERMS OF SUBSIDIES AT WHAT DOES IT THE STRIKE PRICES TWICE THE PRICE WE CURRENTLY PAY FOR ELECTRICITY OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS
LOCKED IN CONTRACT PERIOD WHICH IS INDEX LINKED WITH A TEN BILLION POUND LEARNT GUARANTEES FOR THE U.K. GOVERNMENT WANTS THE U.K. TAXPAYERS TO TO REALLY STUMP UP IT SEEMS THIS MAY NOT BE ENOUGH THERE'S CLEARLY POLITICAL WILL TO GO AHEAD BUT AT SOME POINT
ONE BEGINS TO SAY FINI LA COMEDY YOU KNOW AND IF THE PROJECT IS SCRAPPED IS THAT NECESSARILY A BAD THING YOU JUST SAID THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND BRITISH TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO BE THE HOOK FOR QUITE A LONG TIME THEY MIGHT BE QUIETLY HOPING THAT THE DEAL DOESN'T NECESSARILY GO
IT'S LOOKING TO BE THAT WAY AND IT'S LOOKING THAT E.D.F. ARE SEEKING ARE BACK TO A SORT OF HONOURABLE BACK TO OUT AS WELL TO THE DEAL THE REACT ALL OF IT SEEMS DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC
AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO TO TO SKIN THIS CAT TO PURR PULLED OFF FROM THEY'RE FROM UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THAT NORMALLY WHEN COUNTRIES OR ECONOMIC BLOTS LOWER RATES DRAMATICALLY IT WEAKENS THEIR CURRENCIES THAT'S NOT BEEN THE CASE FOR THE EURO AND WHERE THEY ARE CURRENTLY NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES FOR OVERNIGHT DEPOSITS IN SWEDEN SWITZERLAND AND DENMARK THEY HAVE NEGATIVE MAIN BANK RATES
MARK CHANDLER IS FROM THE WEALTH MANAGEMENT COMPANY B. B. H. GOOD MORNING TO YOU MARK WHAT IS GOING ON THIS IS AN ECONOMIC PHENOMENON THE INTEREST RATES ARE BELOW WHERE THEY SHOULD BE WELL BELOW THE KIND OF THE ZERO POINT MARK AND YET THOSE CURRENCIES AREN'T PLUMMETING YES WHAT A WORLD WE LIVE IN HERDS THAT WE'VE GOT THROUGH ALICE IN WONDERLAND LOOKING GLASS END EDITOR ALBERT HALL I THINK PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS MEANS MY SENSES IN THE SHORT RUN
IT DID OH THINGS DISRUPTING THE IMPACT OF THESE NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES AND HE HAS TO DO WITH HOW FINELY AND SERIOUS STRUCTURE TRADES WHEN HE MADE BY THE UNDERLYING ASSET THEY MIGHT KICK AN INSURANCE POLICY OUT IN THE CURRENCY AND THERE'S THOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS GO SOUTH LIKE THE STOCK MARKET
GET OUT OF THIS HOLE POSITIONS WHICH MEANS BUYING BACK THEIR INSURANCE POLICY IN THE INSURANCE POLICY COULD BE A SHORT YEN POSITION HER SHORT YOUR POSITION A SHORT VISIT WAS EXPECTED TO GET WEAKER IT'S BETTER TO GET WEAKER AND WE DON'T CHARGE THEM PROTECTS THEM FROM A WEAKER CURRENTLY IN THERE WHEN THEY START MARKET FALSE THEY HAVE TO BUY BACK THEIR INSURANCE POLICY WHICH MEANS BY THAT THE EURO
I BACKED THE JAPANESE YEN SO THEY STRENGTHEN WHEN THE STOCK MARKET SELL OFF ONE OF THE STOCK MARKET STUFF FALLING LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE MADE OF HAPPEN BEGINNING THIS WEEK YOU THINK THE STOCK MARKET THE BEAR MARKET WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE MONTHS MIGHT MIGHT BE EASING OFF SOMEWHAT YES IF THE DEAD IT'S THE SELLING PRECIOUS SEEMS EXHAUSTED
AND THAT WE SEE THIS WITH THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET FOR EXAMPLE HID AMONG THE HARDEST DOWN ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT BEFORE YESTERDAY YESTERDAY WAS UP SEVEN PER CENT CLEARED UP ABOUT ANOTHER PER CENT AND I THINK THIS IS A REFLECTION OF THIS STATE SENTIMENT THAT WAY AHEAD OF THE GAME
IS THE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS AS YOU MENTION HE'S NEGATIVE INTEREST WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY WHERE THE EURO IN WAYS EVEN IF THERE'S THIS SHORT BLUNT DISRUPTION AND DOES THE FACT THAT CENTRAL BANKS OR COLOUR PRINTING MONEY DOES AND HIS RATES ARE ALREADY ROCK BOTTOM IT'S NOT NEGATIVE DOES THAT SHOW THAT THE CENTRAL BANKS
CAN'T DO ANY MORE AT ALL I THINK IT IS SOME PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY ARE BUT I THINK THEY'RE TO PHALANX HUNTS WHO IS THE CHINESE OF MILITARY PHILOSOPHER THAT THE IDEAS HAVE YOU EVER UNDERESTIMATE YOUR ADVERSARY AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE A GOLDEN RULE HE WITH THE GOLD MAKES THE RULES
IN THE CENTRAL BANKS HAVE A GOLD THERE IS THEY CAN CHANGE THE RULES OF THE GAME BUT EVERYTHING THEY'VE TRIED PAUL OVER THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS HASN'T NECESSARILY HAD THE DESIRED IMPACT WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT A DEFLATION RE ENVIRONMENT I THINK THAT THE CENTRAL BANKERS IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN THE U.S. THE E.C. B. I THINK EVEN THE BEGGAR JAPAN SAYS THEIR POLICIES LIKE THAT HAVING AS MUCH AFFECTED THEY WISHED
THEY DO HAVE A POWER THERE IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S AGGRESSIVE QUANTITATIVE EASING BUYING BACK GOVERNED BY ITS PRINTING MONEY AS YOU SEE IT THE U.S. ECONOMY WOULD NOT HAVE RECOVERED AS STRONGLY WE'VE HAD FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE U.S. U.K. LEADER THIS WEEK'S REPORT EMPLOYMENT IT LIKELY DIPPED A LITTLE FURTHER SUPER MARCHER CHANDLER THERE FROM B. B. H. LET ME BRING IN A LAURA LAMBIE FROM INVEST TAKE GOOD MORNING TO YOU LAURA LAURA LAURA IS OUR MARKETS GUESS DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THESE NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES AND THE IMPACT IT MIGHT HAVE
WELL CERTAINLY IN JAPAN THE THE THE THE
POINT OF NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES WHICH ARE BEING INTRODUCED TO DIE AND FLAGGED UP IN JANUARY IS TO TRY AND CONQUER DEFLATION WHICH HAS BESET THE JAPANESE MARKET AND THE WAY THAT OUR WORK IS THAT BANKS WILL CHARGE COMMISSION
DO YOU ACTUALLY HALL WILL BE CHARGED COMMISSION TO ACTUALLY HOLD CASH AND THE HOPE IS THAT THIS WILL BOOST LENDING AND HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON CONSUMPTION AND INVESTMENT AT THAT THAT IS WELL OUT ON THAT THE BOSS OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK MARIA DRAGGY HE SPOKE YESTERDAY HE SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO MORE STUFF
TO STOKE UP ECONOMIC GROWTH WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT IT'S IT HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS IT DID INDEED THE IMPLICATION BEING THAT THAT HE WILL NOT HESITATE TO ACT IN ORDER TO BOOST THE EUROPEAN STOCK MARKET AND EUROPEAN BANKS
HE HINTED THAT FOR THEIR MONETARY MONETARY STIMULUS COULD OCCUR SOON AS SOON AS NEXT MONTH AND THAT HAD A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT ON EUROPEAN MARKETS WHICH WAS REFLECTED ROUND THE GLOBE
DO YOU THINK THAT IT WOULD BE HERE BUT HE WILL BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE HE'S TRIED A LOT OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS HE HAS AND YOU KNOW AS WE WEREN'T HEALING EARLIER ON SENTIMENT HAS REALLY CHANGED SINCE THE START OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE FUNDAMENTALS EM ON THE GLOBAL MARKET HAVEN'T REALLY THE WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY CONCERNS OVER A HARD LANDING IN CHINA
THE THE LOW PRICE OF OIL PERHAPS WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON BAD AIR BAD DEBTS AND BANKS BUT YOU'LL COMPANY SETTLING IN THE STATES AND IN THE U.K. ARE ANNOUNCING A DECENT PROFITS TO THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE A FINE IT'S A SENTIMENT HAS CHANGED SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR
AND WE CERTAINLY ARE COVERED IN MARKETS THIS WEEK THANKS FLORENCE LAURA LAMBIE THERE FROM INVEST TECH WEALTH AND INVESTMENT HOUSEHOLD INCOMES HAVE FINALLY SURPASSED THE PEAK THAT THEY REACHED AT THE START OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND YOUR AVERAGE INCOMES IN BRITAIN STOOD AT JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND BUT DON'T EXPECT LIVING STANDARDS TO CONTINUE TO RISE THAT'S THE VIEW OF THE CENTRE LEFT THINK TANK THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION AND JOINING ME NOW IS MATTHEW WHITTAKER THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT R.A.F. GOOD MORNING MATTHEW
GOOD MORNING SO WHAT DID YOUR RESEARCH FIND AS YOU SAY IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING BUT THE GOOD NEWS THE REALLY POSITIVE NEWS IS THAT TYPICAL HOUSEHOLD INCOMES ARE BACK NOT JUST TO WHERE THEY WERE WHEN WE ENTER THE CRISIS BUT BACK TO THEIR PEAK
THAT'S BEEN UNDERPINNED BY REALLY STRONG LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT GROWTH BUT ALSO BY ULTRA LOW INFLATION SO WE'VE SEEN FINALLY THE END OF THE SIX YEAR PAY SQUEEZE WHERE WAGES JUST WEREN'T KEEPING PACE WITH INFLATION GROWTH AND SO ON THAT INFLATION WAS PRETTY HIGH IN TWENTY TWENTY TEN TWENTY ELEVEN TWENTY TWELVE AND THAT ERODED ANY POSSIBLE GAINS AS THE THERE'S THE RECESSION ENDED I PRESUME
THAT'S RIGHT AND SO WE WE'VE SEEN WAGE GROWTH OVER THE LAST YEAR OR TWO IT ACTUALLY HASN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY SPECTACULAR BUT ONCE YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT INFLATION'S BEEN BUMPING ALONG PRETTY MUCH ZERO IT'S MEANT THAT WE'VE HAD WAGE GROWTH WHICH IS IN THAT TREND OR EVEN FOR A TEMPORARY PERIOD SLIGHTLY ABOVE TRANCE THAT'S BEEN A REAL BOOST TO LIVING STANDARDS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE BIG QUESTION NOW OF COURSE IS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT AS INFLATION STARTS TO BUILD AGAIN IT'S REGIONALLY THOUGH IT'S NOT VERY EVEN THOUGH SOME REGIONS ARE STILL VERY MUCH A NEGATIVE TERRITORY
THAT'S RIGHT SWEET WITH UNUSUALLY I SUPPOSE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN SOMETHING OF A NARROWING OF INCOME INEQUALITY SO THAT THE HIT THAT PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN FELT RELATIVELY EVENLY ACROSS THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION BUT THERE HAVE BEEN BIG POCKETS OF DIVERGENCE BUYERS YOU SAY LOCATION SO IN SCOTLAND FOR INSTANCE INCOMES ARE ABOUT FOUR PERCENT HIGHER THAN THEY WERE GOING INTO THE CRISIS BUT IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE TWO AND A HALF PER CENT LOWER WEST MIDLANDS EAST OF ENGLAND HAVE ALSO STRUGGLED AND SOME AGE GROUPS ON NO DIPS IN THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING AT ALL
YES IS THERE'S A LONGER TERM TREND GOING ON HERE WHEREBY PENSIONER INCOMES HAVE BEEN RISING MORE QUICKLY THAN WE CAN GAUGE INCOMES FOR SOME TIME NOW SO PENSIONER INCOMES REMAIN LOWER THAN WORKING AGENT COMES BUT THEY'VE BEEN INCREASING MORE QUICKLY SO IF WE ROW BACK TO TWO THOUSAND TWO IN FACT WE SHOULD A PENSIONER INCOMES OF RHYTHM RISEN BY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OVER THAT PERIOD BUT WORKING AGE INCOMES JUST BY TWO PER CENT TO PENSION INCOME GOING UP TEN TIMES AS FAST OH O.K. THAT'S MATTHEW WHITTAKER THERE THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION

Y. YOU LEADERS WILL MEET ON THURSDAY TO TRY TO HAMMER OUT A DEAL BUT THERE ARE SIGNS THAT MANY COUNTRY STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE DETAILS THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD HAS CAST DOUBT ON WHETHER A CEASEFIRE PROPOSED TO HER LATER THIS WEEK CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IT WAS AGREED BY WORLD POWERS AT A SECURITY MEETING IN MUNICH LAST WEEK BUT PRESIDENT ASAD SAID THE AGREEMENT DID NOT GUARANTEE THAT ALL SIDES WOULD STOP USING WEAPONS
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE IS DUE TO MEET THE WIDOW OF LORD BRITTEN TO DISCUSS SCOTLAND YARD'S INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE LATE CONSERVATIVE PEER POLICE INTERVIEWED LORD BRITTEN ABOUT HISTORICAL ALLEGATION OF RAPE BUT HE DIED IN JANUARY LAST YEAR WITHOUT KNOWING THE CASE HAD BEEN CLOSED
B.B.C. NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THOUSANDS OF SHELTERED HOUSING PROPERTIES HAS BEEN DELAYED OR CANCELLED BECAUSE OF PROPOSED BENEFIT CUTS THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S REVIEWING THE IMPACT OF THEIR POLICY TO ENSURE THE SECTOR WORKS AS WELL AS POSSIBLE

THE FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH HAS HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO TRY TO BOOST HIS YOUNGER BROTHER JEB'S BID FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION THE TWO BROTHERS APPEARED AT A RALLY IN SOUTH CAROLINA AHEAD OF SATURDAY'S PRIMARY ELECTION THERE
U.S. AND CUBAN OFFICIALS WILL SIGN A DEAL IN HAVANA TODAY TO REINSTATE COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE EARLY SIXTIES OPERATORS ARE EXPECTED TO BID FOR THE NEW ROOTS WHICH ARE DUE TO BEGIN IN THE AUTUMN IT IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN DAVID CAMERON IS IN BRUSSELS THIS MORNING I HARDLY NEED TELL YOU WHY CHRIS MORRIS'S A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE RENEGOTIATION SETS OUT WHAT WE ARE STILL CALLING THEM THE CRISP BUT TO WHOM IS HE GOING TO TALK
WELL IT'S INTERESTING JOHN YOU THERE'S BEEN NO SIGN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS OF DAVID CAMERON RUSHING TO ENJOY THE HOSPITALITY OF LEADERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND YET TWO DAYS BEFORE THIS CRITICAL SUMMIT HERE HE IS HE'LL BE HERE THIS MORNING WHY BECAUSE AS MUCH AS THIS MIGHT STICK IN HIS CRAW IN SOME WAYS HE NEEDS THEIR SUPPORT AND CO OPERATION
OF SENIOR LEADERS OF THIS PARLIAMENT HE'S BEEN INSISTING AND SENIOR E.U. OFFICIALS SAY THE SAME THAT IF THIS RENEGOTIATION PRODUCES A DEAL ON FRIDAY IT WILL HAVE LEGALLY BINDING FORCE BUT THERE IS A BUTTON IT'S A BIG BUT THERE ARE
PARTS WITHIN IT FOR EXAMPLE THE IDEA OF RESTRICTING IN WORK BENEFITS FOR MIGRANT WORKERS FOR EXAMPLE THE IDEA OF INDEXING CHILD BENEFIT SO THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE BASED IN OTHER COUNTRIES ONLY GET CHILD BENEFIT CORRESPONDING TO THE COST OF LIVING IN THAT COUNTRY
THOSE SORTS OF ISSUES NEED CHANGES IN E.U. REGULATIONS AND TO DO THAT THAT MEANS PARLIAMENT WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO THOSE CHANGES AND THAT'S A BIT I THINK LIKE OPENING UP PANDORA'S BOX THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE HOW THE LIKELY IT MAY BE
THAT PARLIAMENT WOULD SIMPLY PASS THE DETAILS OF THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT TRYING TO AMEND IT HE'D ANYWAY RIGHT YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING ARE YOU THAT THE WHOLE THING COULD FOUNDER ON THE ROCK OF THE PARLIAMENT
NO I THINK THAT'S PUTTING IT TOO STRONGLY BUT WHAT THE PARLIAMENT'S DO WHEN LEGISLATION COME BEFORE THEM WHAT THE PARLIAMENTARIANS DO THAT THEY KEEP THEY USUALLY TRY TO AMEND IT AND SOMETHING AS CONTROVERSIAL AS SOCIAL SECURITY EVERY COUNTRY'S GOT SOMETHING THEY'D LIKE TO CHIP AWAY AT WHEN IT COMES TO SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION SO I THINK WE CAN EXPECT PEOPLE TO TRY TO MAKE CHANGES IN THIS PACKAGE WHICH WOULD ONLY COME UP DON'T FORGET IN ALLEGEDLY HAVE SENSE
AFTER A VOTE IN A BRITISH REFERENDUM IN OTHER WORDS IF BRITAIN VOTES TO STAY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION ONLY THEN WITH THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS START SO IT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE PRIME MINISTER I THINK IN PRESENTATIONAL TERMS THAT HIS OPPONENT WILL BE ABLE TO SAY PARLIAMENT CAN PUT
A BLOCK ON ALL THIS THAT'S WHY HE'S HERE I THINK TALKING TO THE LEADERS OF THE MAIN GROUPS IN PARLIAMENT HE'S NOTABLY AVOIDING NIGEL FAHRT AAGE ANOTHER EUROSCEPTIC LEADERS MY FARAGE HAS CALLED HIM GUTLESS BECAUSE OF THAT BUT HE NEEDS THE SUPPORT OF THE MAIN LEADERS IN THIS PARLIAMENT TO TRY TO ENSURE TO TRY AND GET THE BEST GUARANTEE HE CAN THAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD GO THROUGH WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM JUST JUST A SENTENCE IF YOU WERE CRUCIAL TO DO YOU GET THE SENSE THAT
THEY COLLECTIVELY INCLUDING THE PARLIAMENT EXPECT THERE TO BE SOME SORT OF DEAL BY THE END OF THE WEEK
I THINK YES IT'S MOST LIKELY I DON'T THINK WE'D HAVE HEARD DOWNING STREET BRIEFING ABOUT A CABINET POSSIBLE CABINET MEETING ON FRIDAY IF THEY WEREN'T EXPECTING IT I THINK OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE GOT SUCH BIG PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE NOTABLY ON MIGRATION THEY DON'T WANT A FIGHT ABOUT BRECK'S IT TO DRAG ON AND ON BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS JUST A SMOKESCREEN THE ISSUES WERE SAYING WHETHER IT BE CHILD BENEFIT WITH EASTERN EUROPE OR PROBLEMS WITH FRANCE THESE ARE REAL ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS CHRIS THANKS A LOT
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO SEVEN HUNDREDS OF SHELTERED HOUSING UNITS FOR THE ELDERLY OR PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES WILL NOT NOW BE BUILT BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO CUT HOUSING BENEFIT MICHAEL BUCHANAN IS A SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT AND MICHAEL WHAT HAS CHANGED TO STOP THIS BUILDING FROM HAPPENING
GOOD MORNING YESES OR CHAINS IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE CHANCELLOR IN THE AUTUMN STATEMENT ESSENTIALLY IT IS THIS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE TENANTS OF IN SOCIAL HOUSING SHOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY MORE AND HOUSING BENEFIT THE LOCAL PEOPLE NEARBY WHO WERE TENANTS IN THE PRIVATE RENTED SECTOR SWORDS EQUALISING THE HOUSING BENEFIT RATE LOCALLY AND MISTER OSBORNE SAY THE MOVE WOULD SAY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION CONES BY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE
TWO LITTLE CARVING IT'S THE MONEY WOULDN'T SHOULD BE CUT UNTIL APRIL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IT WILL ONLY AFFECT NEW TENANCIES THAT ASSIGNED SIGNED FROM THIS APRIL SO THERE'S THERE'S A FEW COVERS TWO DOZEN SAID BUT IT'S HAVING A REAL IMPACT ON THE BUILDING OF THESE UNITS NO BECAUSE WHAT HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS SAY IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP ANY MORE
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP ANY MORE ESSENTIALLY THE THE KIND OF PROPERTIES THAT THEY PROVIDE HAVE EXTRA FACILITIES WHETHER THAT BE ROUND THE CORE CARE SERVICES FROM SCRA SOME CATERING FACILITIES SOME OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS THAT WERE PLANNED WE'RE GOING TO USE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW A CLEAR STUFF FOR INSTANCE WHEN SOMEBODY FELL AND MIGHT NEED EXTRA SUPPORT THE ARE INDEPENDENT LIVING BUT THEY HAVE THIS
ROCKWELL OWN ELEMENT TO THEM AND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THAT BECAUSE THE HOUSING BENEFIT RATES WILL FALL FOR THESE NEW TERENCE IS THE THE THE THE SCHEMES ARE NO LONGER FINANCIALLY VIABLE THE NATIONAL HOUSING FEDERATION CALCULATE THAT THE TENANTS WHO ARE AFFECTED WERE LOSE AN AVERAGE OF SIXTY EIGHT POUNDS A WEEK AND THESE SHELTERED HOUSING SCHEMES AND THAT HAS LED TO SAMPLE HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS THAT WE'VE WE'VE SPOKEN TO SAYING THAT THE NUMBERS NO LONGER A DOT
COUPLE OF GONE THE BUILDERS SO MEANT TO BE ON SITE IN JANUARY ON THE BOARDS OF THESE HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS ARE SAID WE CAN'T PROCEED WHILE THIS UNCERTAINTY CONTINUES THE GOVERNMENT OF SAY THE SUPPORT SHELTERED HOUSING THEY ARE CUTTING OUT THE FIGHT A REVIEW OF THIS POLICY THAT REVIEW IS TAKING PLACE THESE THESE PROJECTS AT HUNDREDS OF SHELTERED HOUSING PROPERTIES ARE BEING STALLED THEM NOT PROCEEDING
MICHAEL YOU CAN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SERVE ON THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE IS GOING TO BE LADY BRITAIN TODAY THE WIDOW OF THE FORMER HOME SECRETARY LEON BRITTAN WHO DIED LAST YEAR UNAWARE THAT HE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF RAPE ACCUSATIONS DANNY SHAW IS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT AND SHE'S A VERY ANGRY LADY SHE WILL NOT ALLOW HIM IN HER HOUSE
WELL THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A PRIVATE MEETING JOHN IN AT A CENTRAL LONDON HOTEL IN THE MID AFTERNOON AND I THINK THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE MEETING IS SO THAT SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE CAN EXPLAIN THE DELAY IN THIS RAPE INVESTIGATION
THE ALLEGATION WAS FIRST MADE BY A WOMAN WHO WAS NINETEEN AT THE TIME IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THAT SHE'D BEEN RAPED BY LEON BRITTAN THAT ALLEGATION WAS FIRST MADE IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWELVE IT TOOK ALMOST THREE YEARS BEFORE LADY BRITAIN WAS TOLD THE CASE WAS OVER AND THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED HAD HE BEEN ALIVE NOW THE METROPOLITAN POLICE HAS ALREADY APOLOGISED TO LADY BRITAIN IN A LETTER LAST YEAR FOR NOT TELLING HER EARLIER
THEY SAID THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD IN APRIL LAST YEAR IN FACT SHE WAS INFORMED IN OCTOBER SO THERE WAS A DELAY OF SEVERAL MONTHS BUT THE METROPOLITAN POLICE WILL SAY THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS NOT COMPLETELY FINISHED HADN'T BEEN FORMALLY CLOSED BY THE TIME THAT BRITAIN DIED IN JANUARY LAST YEAR SO THEY WILL BE ASKED TO EXPLAIN THE DELAY WHY IT TOOK SO LONG
THE SECOND ISSUE THAT WILL FORM PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS I UNDERSTAND IS ABOUT OPERATION MIDLAND NOW BETTY SEPARATE TO THE RAPE ALLEGATION LAW BRITAIN HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INVESTIGATIONS UNDER OPERATION MIDLAND OF COURSE THAT INQUIRY TO AN ALLEGED TO V.I.P. PAEDOPHILE RING IN WESTMINSTER HIS HOMES WERE SEARCHED IN MARCH LAST YEAR TWO MONTHS
AFTER HIS DEATH SO THERE WILL BE SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT AS WELL SO IT'S STILL GOING ON OPERATION MIDLAND IT IS STILL GOING ON I DON'T THINK THE CLOSURE IS IMMINENT THE SIGNS ARE AND I SAY THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO READ THIS BUT THE SIGNS ARE THAT THE ACTIVE PHASE OF THE INVESTIGATION MAY BE DRAWING TO A CLOSE THERE'S BEEN NO OFFICIAL STATEMENT ABOUT THAT BUT THAT'S THE SORT OF SENSE THAT I'M GETTING THIS IS AN ENQUIRY THAT'S GONE ON FIFTEEN MONTHS
MY BELIEF AND THIS IS BASED ON HAVING SEEN PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS RUN BY THE POLICE IS THAT IF THEY HAD WANTED TO CLOSE THIS AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS IF THEY REALLY FELT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THESE ALLEGATIONS WHATSOEVER THEY WOULD'VE DONE SO BUT THE INVESTIGATION HAS GONE ON FOR FIFTEEN MONTHS I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT SCOTLAND YARD WOULD WASTE IT'S TIME WITH DETECTIVES INVESTIGATING SOMETHING IF THEY DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING WORTH INVESTIGATING DON'T FORGET THIS IS A CASE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REVIEWS AS IS FAIRLY ROUTINE AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS AND THAT REVIEW IF THE REVIEWERS SAID LOOK SHUT THIS DOWN IT'S A WASTE OF TIME I'M PRETTY SURE THE MET WOULD HAVE DONE SO SO THE CONCLUSION OF IT MAYBE MORE NUANCED THEM PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE ARE MAKING OUT THANKS DANNY

BUSH HAS JOINED THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO HELP BOOST HIS YOUNGER BROTHER JEB'S STUMBLING BID IT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE PRESIDENT BUSH IS STILL VERY POPULAR AMONG REPUBLICANS AND BECAUSE THE FRONT RUNNER DONALD TRUMP STARTED CRITICISING HIM PARTICULARLY DECISION TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ

ONE ONE ONE CALL CENTRE CLAIMS THAT SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WHO HAD RECENTLY TAKEN THEIR G.C.S.E.S WERE EMPLOYED TO HANDLE URGENT CALLS IN SPITE OF NOT BEING TRAINED IN HOW TO ASSESS PATIENTS IT ALLEGES THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT IN TO HELP MEET CALL ANSWERING TARGETS A WHISTLEBLOWER

IT'S NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT DAVID CAMERON WOULD DISCUSS HIS PROPOSED REFORMS WITH THE HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN BRUSSELS TODAY AHEAD OF US SUMMIT ON THURSDAY
FOR ANYONE TEMPTED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE HORRORS OF BRINGING UP SMALL CHILDREN HE'S A BIT OF GOOD NEWS THEY CAN BE GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH SERIOUSLY GOOD AFTER MICHELLE LINDERMAN IS A RESEARCHER AT THE INSTITUTE AND SHE WORKED ON THIS STUDY GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING AND THIS IS BECAUSE YOU BECOME MORE IMMUNE TO DISEASES IF YOU HAVE SOME I SHALL BRING UP SMALL CHILDREN
SO WHAT WE ACTUALLY FOUND IS THAT PARENTS WHEN THEY SHARE A CHILD ACTUALLY HAVE VERY SIMILAR IMMUNE SYSTEMS TO EACH OTHER
WHAT WE THINK THAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THIS SHARED ENVIRONMENT OF SHARING A CHILD ACTUALLY DRIVES YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO LOOK THE WAY THAT IT DOES
RIGHT SO IF WHAT LET'S JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS SHARING IT IF ONE POINT IF A CHILD IS BROUGHT UP BY ONE PARENT SINGLE PARENT DOES THAT PARENTS IMMUNE SYSTEM BENEFIT FROM IT
WELL I'LL CERTAINLY BE IMPACTED BY IT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE SHARING OUR ENVIRONMENT WITH WITH THAT CHILD BUT WHAT WE REALLY FOUND THAT WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IS THAT HAVING A CHILD DOES DOES SHAPE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS AREN'T ACTUALLY CHANGES THE WAY THAT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BOOKS THAT RUINS IT IS IT BECAUSE THE CHILD BRINGS IN THE SORT OF BUGS THAT YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH
WELL I'LL GO OVER OVERSIMPLIFICATION WHO SENT CERTAINLY CERTAINLY ONE THING THAT WE THINKING THAT SORT OF OUR CHILD AS A VECTOR HYPOTHESIS BY WHICH THE CHILD GOES TO NURSERY OR SCHOOL AND UP ALL SORTS OF LOVELY INFECTIONS AND THEN BRINGS THEM HOME TO BOTH PARENTS AND THAT AND THAT SHARED INFECTION HISTORY PROBABLY DOES SHAPE HOW YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM LOOKS BECAUSE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS CONSTANTLY RESPONDING TO THOSE INFECTIONS SO IT'S REALLY THE SAME ARGUMENT THERE SAYS MY MOTHER A LITTLE BIT OR DO IT DOES YOU GOOD IT'S ALMOST THAT SAME HYPOTHESIS IS
ALMOST BUT IF IT'S TO PARENTS TOGETHER BRINGING UP THE CHILD THEN WHAT YOUR WORK SHOWS IS THAT THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS BECOME LIKE EACH OTHER EXACTLY EXACTLY TO HAVING A CHILD BRINGS YOU TOGETHER IN WAYS THAT YOU'VE NOT EXPECTED
SO THIS IS GOOD WHERE WHERE I ACTUALLY SAYING THIS IS NATURE'S WAY OF THEM MAKING A CHILD BRINGING UP A CHILD BENEFIT THE PARENT
YEAH YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT'S NOT SO MUCH WHETHER IT'S A GOOD OR BAD IT'S JUST HAVING A CHILD SHAPES YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT JUST MAKES YOU YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS UNIQUE TO YORK TO YOURSELF IT JUST TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU HAVE A CHILD IT'S MUCH MORE SIMILAR TO THAT OF YOUR PARTNER THAN IT WAS BEFORE YOU HAD THE CHILD ABOVE AND THAT COULD BE GOOD OR BAD COULDN'T IT GOOD OR BAD
UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF THAT THEN IS IT IS IT BETTER TO HAVE JOB OR PERHAPS YOU CAN'T ANSWER DIDN'T PARTY RESEARCHER IS IT BETTER TO HAVE A CHILD FROM THIS NARROW PERSPECTIVE SEPARATELY OR TOGETHER WITH SOMEBODY ELSE HOW TO BRING UP THE CHILD SEPARATELY OR TOGETHER WELL I THINK PROBABLY FROM OUR STUDY WHAT WE COULD REALLY CONCLUDE WAS THERE
HAVING A CHILD HAS A BIGGER IMPACT ON YOUR IMMUNE LANDSCAPE THAN ACUTE UNTREATED GASTROENTERITIS SO IT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT BUT I THINK A CHILD AS A BIGGER EFFECT THAN IF YOU'VE GOT A TERRIBLE SUMMIT PROBLEM IG'S EXACTLY IN OUR STUDY WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT PEOPLE WHO WERE TRAVELLING TO A DEVELOPING NATION AND WITH A HIGH RISK OF GETTING TRAVELLERS' DIARRHOEA AND LOOKED AT THE IMPACT THAT HAD ON THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM COMPARED TO HAVING A CHILD IT WAS A REALLY NEGLIGIBLE
RIGHT SO MAYBE I'M GOING TO OVER SIMPLIFY A LITTLE BIT TO BE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE DIARRHOEA FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND BRING UP A CHILD
CERTAINLY YOU COULD SUMMARISE AT THAT WAY ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY THAT PARENTS DISCUSSING THIS RESEARCH WITH ME HAVE ASSURED ME THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE I BET ALL THEY'LL REMEMBER IS HAVING A COLD EVERY OTHER WEEK BECAUSE THE KID EXACTLY BRING HOME ALL THOSE BUGS IT'S FASCINATING STUFF ANYWAY DOT OF INTIMATE THANKS A LOT
NOT A PROBLEM THANKS FOR HAVING ME IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND IT IS A CRUCIAL DAY IN UKRAINE FOR THE GOVERNMENT THERE WHICH IS HOPING TO AVOID A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE FROM ITS PARLIAMENT EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING BRITAIN AS WELL AS THE I.M.F. WHICH HAS BAILED OUT UKRAINE TO THE TUNE OF SEVENTY AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS
HAVE ALL EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RESIGNING FROM THE GOVERNMENT PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOSE RESIGNING FAVOUR REFORM AND SAY THEY'RE GOING BECAUSE OF CORRUPTION AND LACK OF CHANGE FROM KIEV TOM BURRIDGE REPORTS IN A TELEVISION STUDIO IN THE UKRAINIAN CAPITAL
THE EVE OF A CRUCIAL TEST FOR THE GOVERNMENT HE ORDER IF THAT'S THE FILM NOT IF I DO GO ON OFF YOU KNOW MABEL PIGGY TWO HOURS OF INTENSE POLITICAL DEBATE THAT'S WHAT IT DID TO HIM COULDNAE HAVE NEVER BETTER FUCK THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN UKRAINE AT THE MOMENT IS EXTREMELY VOLATILE SEVERAL POLITICAL FORCES ARE TRAINED TO BEND THAT THEIR FAVOUR PUSH AND PULL AND PULL IN AND PORTIONS TO GO ROBERTA A VIV'S ANDREE COOLER CALLED IS THE PRESENTER ON ICY TEE VEE
IT HURTS US TOO SHE ERA FROM TIME TO TIME THAT UKRAINE IS A FAILED STATE AND WE'VE HEARD SUCH STATEMENTS FROM SOME FOREIGN POLITICIANS IF WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION SAW BILLY WE MUST ADMIT THAT THERE ARE GRANTS FOR THEM TO SAY SO UKRAINE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PUT OUR ALL SEEING STILL ORDER IT IS OBVIOUS NOT TO MANY PEOPLE THAT WOULD ULTRA FORMS
WE WILL NEVER RECEDES TOO DEMOCRATIC WAGE OF BUILD IN OUR OWN LIFE FRANCE
THE LATEST REFORMER TO QUICK PUBLIC OFFICE IN UKRAINE IS ENTIRELY CASCO RUSH A LITTLE BIT WITH THE HAPPY YES GOVERNMENT FAILS TO MAKE REFORMS THE NOW FORMER DEPUTY PROSECUTOR GENERAL SAYS IT'S CRITICAL THAT UKRAINE IMPLEMENTS RADICAL CHANGE TO END CORRUPTION YOU GREEN IS IN THE STATE OR SUPPORTED BY OUR AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN LEEKS THEY'LL NEVER SEE SERIOUS INVESTMENTS FROM YOU'D HAVE BEEN COUNTESS OF FUNDING AND I DO STAYS THIS SERIES IF OUGHT TO DEMONSTRATE
IN THE REST OF US THAT THIS IS YOU CAN'T TREAT THE NEW RULES
TRUST TRUST ON ALEXANDER STARTED THERE WAS A STOCKBROKER LASTS TWO YEARS AGO HE AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS JOINED THE PROTESTS AROUND KIEV'S INDEPENDENCE SQUARE KNOWN AS THE MY DAMN YOU REMIND AND I WAS AT THE SAME PLACE AT THE
WE WERE SO INTO SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED I WANT VERY MUCH THAT PEOPLE SHOULDN'T DO KILT IN VAIN
SCHOOL BROUGHT TO GOOD I THOUGHT YOU EXPLAINED IN A FUNKY ANIMATED VIDEO ON MAROC
ALEX'S TEAM ARE STREAMLINING THE CELL WE DIGITISING ONLINE AND ULTIMATELY VERY HOPE MAKING UKRAINE'S SYSTEM OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT THERE'S MUCH LESS CORRUPT PUBLIC PROCUREMENT WAS A SYNONYM OF CORRUPTION AND YOUR GRAND ARE YOU HOPING TO SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR YOU CHRIS TARRANT USED TO LIVE UP TO
BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY I THINK THAT YOU WILL BE WARM BE ABLE TO REFORM OUR COUNTRY WILL LOSE HER COUNTRY
GUYS OUR SOLDIER WHORE FIGHT HIM AGAINST RUSSIA IN THE EAST THEIR CAN'T ON US YOU BELIEVE THAT THE EXISTENCE THE INDEPENDENCE OF UKRAINE IS AT STAKE NOW I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE
POLITICAL TURMOIL IN UKRAINE WAS ALL TOO EVIDENT WHEN AN M. P. DRAGS PRIME MINSTER GETS A NEWARK FROM THE PODIUM IN THE PARLIAMENT
HE GAVE A SPEECH IN DECEMBER IT WAS THEN A PUNCH UP INVOLVING SEVERAL M.P.
YOU DON'T GO ON THEN UKRAINE'S INTERIOR MINISTER AND THE REGIONAL GOVERNOR OF A DECIR TRADED INSULTS AND ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION AS WELL AS A GLASS OF WATER
SO MUCH IN FIGHTING IN FRUSTRATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT MEANS CHANGE IN UKRAINE IS ALMOST INEVITABLE EUROPEAN LEADERS WILL BE HOLDING THEIR BREATH
TOM BURRIDGE REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE'S NIGERIAN GIRLS WHO WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO ESCAPE FROM BOKO HARAM HAVE NOT BEEN SO LUCKY AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN TREATED BY THEIR FAMILIES SINCE GETTING OUT IT'S NEARLY TWO YEARS SINCE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GIRLS WERE TAKEN FROM A SCHOOL IN CHIP BOX
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED ARE STILL MISSING AND MANY MORE HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM OTHER SCHOOLS AND VILLAGES SINCE RESEARCHERS AT THE PEACE GROUP INTERNATIONAL ALERT HAVE INTERVIEWED FOURTEEN OF THOSE GIRLS ARE PRODUCED A REPORT INTO HOW THEY'VE BEEN TREATED BY THEIR COMMUNITIES THE LEAD RESEARCHER KIM TOO GOOD HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND YOU WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THOSE GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN RAPED AND CAME BACK EITHER PREGNANT OR WITH BABIES YES EXACTLY WE WERE TRYING TO LOOK FOR
THAT SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC TO TRY TO SEE HOW THEY WERE BEING REINTEGRATED BACK INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES WHAT SORTS OF SERVICES WERE BEING PROVIDED TO THEM AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT SORT OF PERCEPTIONS EXIST ABOVE THE CHILD ITSELF ABOUT THE WOMAN AND ABOUT THE TRY WHAT DID YOU FIND WE FOUND THAT COMMUNION HE SEEMED VERY RELUCTANT TO EGGS EXCEPT WOMEN AND GIRLS BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY
THEY CALLED THEM BOOKER HURRAH WHY THERE'S A ASSEMBLY SIR WHY WIVES ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT BUGGER
PERHAPS CAST THEM UNDER THEIR SPELL WHILE THEY WERE UNDER CAPTIVITY AND THEREFORE THEY MAY HAVE WILLINGLY ADOPTED SOME OF THE IDEOLOGY OF BOOKER HER AUNT WHILE IN CAPTIVITY SO ONCE THEY RETURN TO THEIR G.P. CARE PEOPLE WERE VERY RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE WITH THEM BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT OVER TIME THE WOMEN AND GIRLS WOULD BE RE ACCEPTED A REACT LIMITED INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES
ONCE TRUST WAS RE ESTABLISHED HOWEVER THE CHILDREN WERE NOT SO LUCKY OVER A NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE THAT WE CALLED IN THE STUDY SAID THE CHILD SHARES THE BLOODLINE WITH THAT INSURGENT OR A TERRORIST AND THEREFORE WOULD NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING IN LIFE
EXCEPT BEING A TERRORIST AND HOW WERE THEY TREATED MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALLY ENGAGE WITH THE CHILDREN AND I WE WERE TALKING TO CHILDREN THAT ARE EXTREMELY YOUNG BUT WHAT THEY SAID WAS THAT IN LIFE THAT CHILD WILL NEVER ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE THAT BAD BLOOD RUNNING THROUGH IT IT WILL NEVER BE ANYTHING
BETTER THAN A HYENA AND THAT WHERE THEY'VE BEEN LOOKED AFTER YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT THEY COME BACK TO THESE I.D.P.S INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE'S AREAS OR CAMPS WHO WHO'S LOOKING AFTER THEM YES BORN AND STATE GOVERNMENT HAS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT TEAM ALSO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT TEAM TAKEN CARE OF THE ENTIRE I.D. PECAN FINANCE THOSE CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE ALSO ON THE I.D. BECOMES THEY ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF
BY THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS SEVERAL I N.G.O.S SUCH AS I SEE I SEE SAVE THE CHILDREN UNICEF AS WELL WHICH IS ONE OF OUR PARTNERS IN THE RESEARCH SO THEY ARE DEFINITELY BEING TREATED THE PROBLEM IS THAT FOR THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO STAY IN HIS I.D. P. CAMPS FOREVER THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE BACK TO THEIR WHOLE NUDGES WANT SECURITY IS TAKEN CARE OF BY THE NIGERIAN MILITARY
SO THE QUESTIONNAIRES ENOUGH THEY'RE NOT REALLY ACCEPTED IN THE I.D. P. CAMP THERE'S NO REAL GUARANTEE THAT THEY'LL BE ACCEPTED ONCE THEY RETURN BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AND WE SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT ABORTION IS ILLEGAL IN NIGERIA SAID THIS IS NOT AN OPTION TO THOSE GIRLS WHO ARE COMING BACK IN CASES OF MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD REQUIRE IT CAN BE ALLOWED BUT ACCORDING TO MAJOR IN
AND THE GIRLS ARE IN THERE WERE FOURTEEN THAT YOU INTERVIEWED WHICH IS UP IT'S A TINY FRACTION IT'S A TINY FRACTION WHO HAVE RETURN BUT THEY MUST HAVE FELT IMMENSE RELIEF WHEN THEY GOT OUT YES HE'S VERY INTERESTING DURING THEIR STUDY ITSELF THE WOMEN AND GIRLS WERE SAYING WE'RE SO HAPPY TO BE HERE WE'VE SURVIVED SOMETHING WERE OBVIOUSLY CARRYING A LONG THIS MEMORY OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND OUR CAPTIVITY
BUT IN FACT THEY ALMOST ALL OF THEM EXPRESSED AND THENCE LOVE FOR THAT CHILD THEY SAID I'M GOING TO LOVE THIS CHILD JUST LIKE I LOVE MY CHILDREN FROM THEY WERE CONCEIVED OF LOVE WITH MY HUSBAND FOR EXAMPLE
IT WAS ONLY THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE AROUND THEM THAT HAD THAT KIND OF SCEPTICISM AROUND THE WOMEN GIRLS AND SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE CHILDREN CAME TOO GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
AND TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST TOM GOLD AGAIN ABSOLUTELY SUSPECTED REALLY FROSTY OUT THERE THIS MORNING MINUS FIVE OR SIX DEGREES IN MANY AREAS OUTSIDE OF TOWN IN CENTRAL LONDON ALSO CLOSE TO FREEZING BUT THE DAY'S NOT LOOKING BAD AT ALL WE'VE GOT SOME CRISP SUNSHINE ON THE WAY FOR MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES IT WILL BE A COLD DAY OF COURSE AFTER A COLD MORNING TEMPERATURES IN MOST CITIES WON'T GET ANY HYMAN AROUND FIVE OR SIX DEGREES AND THAT'S BRIEFLY DURING THE AFTERNOON
THAT'S NOT THE CASE EVERYWHERE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE COLD AND SUNNY WE'RE ALREADY SEEING A CHANGE ACROSS THE FAR NORTH WEST OF THE U.K. IN FACT IN THE WESTERN ISLES OF SCOTLAND IT'S BLOWING A GALE THE RAIN SWEEPING IN OFF THE ATLANTIC AND SOON THAT RAIN WILL BE REACHING OTHER PARTS OF WESTERN SCOTLAND AND IT'LL REACH MANY AREAS OF NORTHERN IRELAND TOO SO THAT MEANS THAT IN THE AFTERNOON LEASE LATER ON IN THE AFTERNOON IT WILL BE WET AND QUITE WINDY IN BELFAST TO THE SAME GOES FOR GLASGOW
AND EVENTUALLY MOST OF THE LOWLANDS OF SCOTLAND WILL GET THAT RING TOO BUT ALL THE WHILE IT'S GOING TO STAY DRY ACROSS MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES NOW TONIGHT'S THAT RAIN IN THE NORTH THAT WE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW WE'LL SLIP TO OTHER PARTS OF THE U.K. AND JUST A WORD OF CAUTION IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS COULD BE A CHANCE OF JUST A BIT OF SNOW FALLING ALMOST ANYWHERE ACROSS THE U.K. THERE ARE STILL A BIT OF THAT COLD WEATHER HANGING AROUND AND BEYOND THAT IT WILL EVENTUALLY TURN A BIT MILDER

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY THE SIXTEENTH OF FEBRUARY THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON WILL MEET SENIOR FIGURES OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TODAY TO TRY TO WIN SUPPORT OF HIS PROPOSED CHANGES TO BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U.

LAST NIGHT HOWEVER DOWNING STREET SAID MISTER CAMERON AND THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS HAD MADE GOOD PROGRESS AT A MEETING IN PARIS HAD AGREED THAT THERE WAS NOW A FIRM BASIS FOR AN AGREEMENT FROM BRUSSELS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS
DAVID CAMERON BEGINS HIS DAY AT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WHERE HE NEEDS TO WIN SOME FRIENDS THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT HIS PROPOSED DEAL WITH THE REST OF THE E.U. WILL BE LEGALLY BINDING BUT SEVERAL PARTS OF IT WILL REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT WILL NEED THE SUPPORT OF ANY PEAS AND OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES AFTER A BRITISH REFERENDUM MY CAMERON WANTS GUARANTEES THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO PIN DOWN
AT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION THE PRIME MINISTER WILL MEET PRESIDENT YOUNGER WHO SAID YESTERDAY THAT HE EXPECTED THE INDEX ATION OF CHILD BENEFIT TO BE AT THE HEART OF DEBATE THIS WEEK THE DRAFT DEAL SAYS CHILD BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO MIGRANT WORKERS IN THE U.K. SHOULD BE MADE ACCORDING TO THE COST OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THE CHILDREN ACTUALLY LIVE
BUT EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE INSISTING THAT THOSE REDUCTION SHOULD ONLY APPLIED TO NEW APPLICANTS NOT TO EXISTING BENEFICIARIES
THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT BUSH A ASSAD HAS CAST DOUBT ON WHETHER A CEASEFIRE PROPOSED FOR LATER THIS WEEK CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IT WAS AGREED BY WORLD POWERS AT A SECURITY MEETING IN MUNICH LAST WEEK BUT IN A TELEVISED ANNOUNCEMENT PRESIDENT ASAD SAID THE AGREEMENT DID NOT GUARANTEE THAT ALL SIDES WOULD STOP USING WEAPONS
IT HAD BEEN AN ORDER ON YOUR LITTLE OFFER CLOCK KNOCK IT OUT OF SMALL BUT UNTIL NOW WE HEAR THEM REQUESTING A CEASEFIRE WITHIN A WEEK O.K.

NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES IN THE SHELTERED HOUSING SECTOR HAS BEEN DELAYED OR CANCELLED DUE TO PROPOSED GOVERNMENT BENEFIT CUTS THE PROPERTIES FOR THE ELDERLY OR PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES TEND TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA CARE SUPPORT THEY PROVIDE HE'S A SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL BE CALLUM
IN THE AUTUMN STATEMENT LAST NOVEMBER GEORGE OSBORNE SAID HOUSING BENEFIT FOR TENANTS IN THE SOCIAL SECTOR WOULD BE CAPPED AT THE SAME RATE AS THAT PAID TO TENANTS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE CHANGE WILL ONLY AFFECT NEW TENANCIES THAT BEGIN AFTER APRIL AND THE MONEY WOULDN'T ACTUALLY TO BE CUT UNTIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT IT'S ALREADY CREATING MAJOR DISRUPTION FOR SOME PROVIDERS OF SHELTERED HOUSING THE NATIONAL HOUSING FEDERATION SEA IS NEARLY TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND UNITS HAVE BEEN SCRAPPED A DELAYED
AND SEVERAL HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS HAVE TOLD US THEIR DEVELOPMENTS ARE NO LONGER FINANCIALLY VIABLE THE FEDERATION CALCULATES THE CUT WILL COST EACH PROVIDER AN AVERAGE OF SIXTY EIGHT POUNDS A WEEK PER TENANT MINISTER SAY THEY ARE CUTTING AT THE THIRD A REVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF THEIR POLICY TO ENSURE THE SHELTERED HOUSING SECTOR WORKS AS WELL AS POSSIBLE
WEBSITES COULD SOON BE FORCED TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL THE GOVERNMENT'S BEGINNING A CONSULTATION ON THE PROPOSALS TODAY PORNOGRAPHY SITES THAT FAILED TO INTRODUCE AGED VERIFICATION SYSTEMS COULD BE FINED OR CUT OFF FROM PAYMENT SERVICES HE'S OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT RORY CATHERINE JONES
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT NEARLY ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE UNDER EIGHTEEN ACCESS ADULT WEBSITES AND IT NOW PLANS TO FULFIL A MANIFESTO COMMITMENT TO REQUIRE EIGHT VERIFICATION FOR ALL SITES CONTAINING PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL IT'S CONSULTING ON A SCHEME WHICH WOULD SEE REGULATORS INTRODUCE THE SYSTEM MUCH LIKE THAT FOR FILMS TO CLASSIFY ADULT WEBSITES AND THEN FIND THOSE THAT DON'T ACT TO CHECK THE AGE OF VISITORS
MOST PORNOGRAPHY SITES ARE BASED OVERSEAS BUT MINISTERS SAY CREDIT CARD FIRMS WOULDN'T WORK WITH THOSE IN BREACH OF THE LAW CUTTING OFF THEIR ACCESS TO FUNDS THE CHALLENGE WILL BE TO FIND A PRACTICAL AGED VERIFICATION SYSTEM AND TO POLICE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES WHOSE USERS MAKE PORNOGRAPHY AVAILABLE FOR FREE
THE HEALTH WATCHDOG HAS BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION AFTER PICTURES WERE PUBLISHED IN A NEWSPAPER APPARENTLY SHOWING ADVISERS AT AN EMERGENCY CALL CENTRE ASLEEP ON DUTY
A FORMER EMPLOYEE FOR THE N.H.S. ONE ONE ONE SERVICE IN ENGLAND HAS CLAIMED AT THE DAILY MAIL THAT STAFF AT THE SITE IN DORSET WERE OVERWORKED MORE DETAILS FROM FRANKIE CAMLEY

MISS HAYES WORKED AT THE SAME SERVICE AS A CALL HANDLER WHO FAILED TO RECOGNISE THAT A ONE YEAR OLD BOY WHO DIED WILLIAM MEAD HAD BEEN SUFFERING FROM SEPSIS THE TRUST SAID IT STRONGLY REJECTED THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE ARTICLE THE SIKH YOU SEE HAS SAID THAT IT WILL CARRY OUT AN EARLY INSPECTION TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS
IT'S BEEN A SUCCESSFUL NIGHT FOR BRITISH MUSICIANS AT THE GRAMMY AWARDS IN LOS ANGELES ED SHEERAN ONE SONG OF THE YEAR AND BEST POP SOLO PERFORMANCE FOR THINKING OUT LOUD MARK RONSON PICKED UP RECORD OF THE YEAR WHILE MUSE WON THE BEST ROCK ALBUM FOR DRONES THE COVETED BEST ALBUM TITLE WENT TO THE AMERICAN SINGER TAYLOR SWIFT
IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN DAVID CAMERON WILL BE MEETING THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION JEAN CLAUDE JUNKER TODAY TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT HIS NEGOTIATIONS TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NOT DE RAILED AT THE LAST MINUTE BY A FEW COUNTRIES OBJECTING TO SOME ELEMENTS OF IT CATCHER ADLER IS A EUROPE ADLER EDITOR AND JOINS US FROM BARRY'S
I CATCH OATHS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SO WELL CHOREOGRAPHED OVER MONTHS AND WHEN WE EVEN NOW HAVE THIS CABINET MEETING SCHEDULED FOR FRIDAY COULD COUNTRIES STICK A SPANNER IN THE WORKS AT THIS LATE STAGE
ANY NUMBER OF COUNTRIES BUT IT ONLY NEEDS ONE COUNTRY BECAUSE FOR DAVID CAMERON'S YOU REFORM DEAL TO BE PASSED SAID THE E.U. SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS EVERY SINGLE E.U. COUNTRY HAS TO SIGN UP TO IT AND TALK ABOUT CHOREOGRAPHY THAT THERE HAS BEEN ALL ALONG A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF THEATRE TO THEIR SUMMER CONCERN THAT MAYBE THE PRIME MINISTER AND OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD MAKE IT MAKE THESE THESE DEAL SEEM REALLY REALLY HUGE WHILE CRITICS BACK AT HOME IN THE U.K. COMPLAINED THAT THEY'VE BEEN WATERED DOWN
AND WERE WEAK BUT THIS WOULD JUST ENABLE DAVID CAMERON TO EMERGE VICTORIOUS WE ARE STING THOUGH REAL PROBLEMS RIGHT UP TO THE WIRE I MEAN DAVID AS HERE IN PARIS LAST NIGHT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FRENCH NEWSPAPERS THIS MORNING ON SAYS HUGE DIFFERENCES REMAIN BETWEEN LONDON AND PARIS PARIS IS WORRIED THAT
DAVID CAMERON SAYS HE WANTS TO PROTECT NON EURO COUNTRIES LIKE BRITAIN IN THE EUROZONE BUT HE'S ACTUALLY BEING SNEAKY AND SEEKING AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE FOR THE CITY OF LONDON AND A BACK DOOR VETO ON EUROZONE AND WHY THE E.U. FINANCIAL LEGISLATION THEY WERE THOSE VEXED SUSPENDING YOU MIGRANT IN WORK BENEFITS THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE APPEARED TO SAY O.K. WE'LL ACCEPT
BUT WE DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF REDUCING THE BENEFITS FOR CHILDREN WHO STILL LIVE ABROAD BRITAIN WANTS REDUCED PAYMENTS FOR MIGRANTS WHOSE CHILDREN LIVE ABROAD ACCORDING TO THE COST OF COUNTRY WHERE THEY LIVE SO THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT WILL LEAD TO A BUMPY RIDE ON THURSDAY AND THEY COULD DERAIL THE DEAL TOGETHER
IT'S A COUNTRY LIKE FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE YOU MENTION THEIR CONCERNS REALLY PREPARED TO SAY NO WE CAN'T HAVE
THIS IS THE BIG QUESTION OF COURSE I MEAN I THINK NOT ONLY ARE THERE VERY REAL CONCERNS AMONGST OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES BECAUSE OF COURSE DON'T FORGET IT'S NOT JUST DAVID CAMERON HAS TO SELL A DEAL AT HOME BUT ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY WANT TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE CLUB I MEAN FOR THE COUNTRY OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE IF BRITAIN IS NOT IN THE E.U. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A JOB THERE AUTOMATICALLY ANYWAY SO THIS IS VERY MUCH AT THE BACK OF PEOPLE'S MINDS WILL THEY PUSH IT INTO THE NIGHT BUT THEN VOTE YES OR WILL THEY SAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S WAIT UNTIL NEXT MONTH AND DISCUSS THAT AGAIN THE PROBLEM FOR THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD BE THIS COULD THEN DELAY HIS
PREFERRED REFERENDUM DAY TOLD OF LATE THIS JUNE AND OF COURSE ONE OPTION IS THAT THERE IS VARIOUS TRADING AND BARGAINING DONE WHICH CHANGES THE SHAPE OF THE DEAL AND PERHAPS ADS IN ALL TAKES AWAY OTHER FACTORS IS THAT A POSSIBILITY THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT'S CRITICS OF DAVID CAMERON AS A SINGLE HAPPENED NOT JUST IN THE LEAD UP TO THE E.U. OTHER COUNTRIES VOTING ON IT BUT AFTERWARDS BECAUSE DAVID COMES NOT ONLY MEETING AT THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION THIS MORNING
HE'S ALSO MEETING THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND LEADING EMMY PEAS WHY'S THAT BECAUSE CERTAIN OF HIS REFORMS FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ONE CHILD BENEFIT THOSE ON CUTTING E.U. MIGRANTS IN WORK BENEFITS THE IDEA OF SHAM MARRIAGES AND TRYING TO STOP BENEFIT FRAUD THEY WILL ALL NEED WHAT'S CALLED SECONDARY LEGISLATION IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
IF THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN VOTE TO STAY IN THE E.U. THEN AFTER THAT THE PARLIAMENT WOULD HAVE TO VOTE AT LEAST ON THESE ISSUES IN ORDER TO BRING THEM INTO EUROPEAN LAW THE FEAR IS HIS THEY COULD STILL TINKERING CHANGE THAT'S WHAT DAVID CAMERON ONCE TODAY IS TO GET THEIR COMMITMENT AND GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL FULLY IMPLEMENT THE U.K. PACKAGE INTO LAW TO MAKE IT LEGALLY WATERTIGHT AS HE HAS ALWAYS PROMISED CATCH ADLER THANKS VERY MUCH THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN
FOUR HOSPITALS BOMBED TWO SCHOOLS ATTACKED EVEN BY THE STANDARDS OF SYRIA IT WAS A BAD DAY IT'S BELIEVED THE RUSSIANS DO BUT IT'S NOT EASY TO PROVE AFTER PETER SALAMA IS THE UNICEF REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE MIDDLE EAST TO NORTH AFRICA TO THE FOUR HOSPITALS THAT CAME UNDER ATTACK WAS SUPPORTED BY UNICEF AND HE IS ON THE LINE A GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TO YOU THIS WAS ABOUT AS BAD AS IT GETS THERE
AND WE STILL CAN'T BE SURE CAN WE THAT IT WAS THE RUSSIANS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY AT THE MOMENT WHO GET IT WITH ME I'LL GO BUT WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE REALLY IS NO EXCUSE FOR ACTING HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN INFRASTRUCTURE EVEN WARS COURSE HAVE BEEN ROUX AND THE CAR GETTING ITS INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY MAY CONSTITUTE A WAR CRIME BUT THEY'RE MORE CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT
IT'S ONE THING TO CALL FOR THEM TO DO IT IT'S ANOTHER THING TO EXPECT HIM IN REALITY TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY POWERLESS AREN'T THEY
WE DIDN'T WE ALSO HEARD FROM AROUND THE WORLD ERIC THAT PETROL ON ADDED FOR THE CONFLICT AND REALLY WE'VE GOT THOSE MEMBER STATE
BUT SO LONG AS ONE SIDE IS SUPPORTED BY ONE BLOCK OF NATIONS AND ANOTHER SIDE IS SUPPORTED BY ANOTHER BLOCK OF NATIONS OF THE WORLD THE PROBLEM SPEAKS FOR ITSELF DOESN'T IT IT COULD BE DIFFICULT
THE COURSE GOING
DOES IT HAVE ALL OF THIS HAVE ANY EFFECT ON HOW YOU THE CHARITIES AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES HOW HOW YOU OPERATE IN THE COUNTRY OR TRIED TO OPERATE IN THE COUNTRY
IMPEDED ENTERTAINED ACTED FOR HUMANITARIAN PROGRAMMES ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT YET IT GOES BUT IN THE END WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO OUR BEST TO REACH ALL OF THOSE CHILDREN AND WOMEN IN NEED OH YES WE DO WE HAVE OPEN WE HAVE HOPE BECAUSE WE SEE THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE INCREDIBLY REBELLION WHOAH INCORRECTLY AND STILL SUPPORTING EACH OTHER INCOME
DOCTOR PETER SALAMA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THAT I'M A SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN HOW HAS THE ROUT IN COMMODITIES AFFECTED ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST MINING FIRMS LINE AND CAN TELL US WELL HE CERTAINLY HAS THE ANGLO AMERICAN WHICH OWNS DE BEERS THE DIAMOND COMPANY SHARES HER COLLAPSED IN THAT COMPANY BY TWO THIRDS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND NOW WE'VE LEARNT OF THEIR PRE TAX LOSSES HAVE JUMPED TWENTY FOLD TO FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION
DOLLARS AS THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS LAST YEAR AS COMMODITY PRICES HAVE PLUMMETED THE MINING COMPANIES ALSO SAID IT'S HER SOLD TWO POINT ONE BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF ASSETS JOHN MAYOR IS FROM THE ENERGY EXPERTS S.P. ANGEL GOOD MORNING TO YOU JOHN WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE RESULTS YOU'VE ONLY HAD A FEW MINUTES I SUPPOSE
I LOOK NOT A DISASTER YES THAT THERE'S A LOSS FROM RIGHT DOWN AND IMPAIRMENTS THE BIG RIGHT DOWN IS THE MERE MEANEST RIO IRON ORE MINE IN IN BRAZIL ANGLO SPENT THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ON THAT AND WHEN WE COMPARE THAT WITH ITS TOTAL DEBT OF
UM TWELVE BILLION YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT WAS NOT NECESSARILY A GREAT PRACTICE MAYBE NOT THE BEST TIMING SHALL WE SAY BUT WE CAN ALL SAY THAT WE HAD WITH VARIOUS THINGS IF THEY HADN'T SPENT THE MONEY THEY COULD BE DEBT FREE BUT THERE IS VALUE TO COME OUT OF THIS MINE IT MAY NOT BE AS GREAT AS IT MIGHT HAVE SEEN WITH WITH IRON OR PRICES DOWN AT THE LEVELS THEY'RE OUT
BUT THE IRON ORE BUSINESS IS NOW THE BIGGEST PERFORMER FOR ANGLO AMERICAN AND JUST AHEAD OF OF THE GREAT FIGURES THAT WE SEE OUT OF DE BEERS BUT NOW THE IS THERE IN A KIND OF A SAVING MECHANISM RIGHT NOW BECAUSE COMMODITY PRICES HAVE PLUMMETED SO MUCH WILL THE KIND TO SELL OFF IN SOME OF THEM STEAKS IN MINES AND THE CLOSURE OF SOME MINDS WILL THAT
STAUNCHED THE FLOW AS IT WERE WELL IT ANGLO AMERICAN IS LONG OVERDUE FOR A RESTRUCTURING OF ALL THE MINING GROUPS THAT'S THE ONE THAT HAS DONE THE LEAST OVER THE YEARS AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS LARGELY POLITICAL I THINK NOT JUST POLITICAL WITHIN ANGLO AMERICAN BUT WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA ANOTHER OTHER NATIONS WHERE IT OPERATES IT'S VERY SENSITIVE TO
TALKING ABOUT JOB CUTS HOW IT DOES TALK ABOUT JOB CUTS IN IN SOME PARTS OF THE GROUP IT'S CLEARLY TAKING AN AXE TO TO ITS COST BASE
AND THERE'S A LOT TO BE GAINED BECAUSE IT'S NEVER REALLY DONE THIS BEFORE RIO'S B.H.P. IKE STRATA HAVE TAKEN AN AXE TO THERE COS ON A REGULAR BASIS ANGLOS HAS GOT A LOT MORE TO DO HERE AND SO THE RESTRUCTURING WILL DO A LOT DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BUY SOME OF THESE ASSETS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT
BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS BUYERS FOR FULL QUALITY ASSETS WERE WEAK WHICH PRODUCE PROFITS VERY BRIEFLY IN NOT HELPED BY THE DOWNGRADING TO JOG STUCKLESS BY MOODY'S YESTERDAY YOU'VE GOT TO WONDER ABOUT THE TIMING OF THAT THE DAY BEFORE THE RESULTS COME OUT MOODY'S TELL GREAT THE STOCK THAT WAS A BIT UNFAIR I THOUGHT JUNK STATUS NOT GOOD FOR ANGLO AMERICAN BUT NOT THE END OF THE WORLD COS THEY CAN THEY CAN
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO RE FINANCE SUPERB JOHN MIRROR THERE FROM S.P. ANGEL THANKS FOR JOINING US NOW E.D.F. ELECTRICITY BUT YOUR PROFITS HAVE COME OUT ACTUALLY SAY THEN A PROFIT IS DOWN SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT TO ONE POINT TWO BILLION POUNDS IT'S ALSO CUT IT'S DIP IT INTO THE COMPANY SAID IT WOULD BE EXTENDING THE LIFE OF FOUR OF
U.K. NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS BY UP TO SEVEN YEARS THERE IN LANCASHIRE TEESIDE AND EAST LOTHIAN INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH A REGARDING HINKLEY POINT NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AND THE PROPOSED A NEW ONE A E.D.F. SAID THE FINAL STEPS WERE WELL IN HAND TO ENABLE THE FULL CONSTRUCTION PHASE TO BE LAUNCHED SOON THE PROJECT IS ALMOST TEN YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE
THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN POLICE AND AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN GIVING OUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SEIZURE OF ONE OF THEIR BIGGEST EVER HALLS OF ILLEGAL DRUGS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF LIQUID META AMPHETAMINE WAS FOUND HIDDEN IN A SHIPMENT OF BRAS CHRIS SHE AND FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE EXPLAINS HOW IT WAS DONE
THE JOINT ORGANISED CRIME GROUP OPERATION BEGAN IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR WHEN YOU STRAIN BORDER FORCE EXAMINED THAT SHIPPING CONTAINER OUT OF HONG KONG
THAT SHIPPING CONTAINER WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN GEL BRA INSERTS AND HIDDEN INSIDE THOSE JOB RIGHT INSERT WAS ONE HUNDRED NINETY LITRES OF LIQUID MIX IN FAREHAM
JESSICA KID IS THE CRIME CORRESPONDENT FOR A.B.C. NEWS IN SYDNEY HELLO TO YOU GOOD MORNING SARAH AND LIQUID METHAMPHETAMINE IS I THINK IT'S KNOWN AS ICE OR IT'S WHAT TURNS INTO CRYSTAL
THAT'S RIGHT THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE TOLD US THAT THIS IS LIQUID METHYL AMPHETAMINE WHICH IS CAPABLE OF BEING TURNED INTO CRYSTAL MYTH OR ICE WHICH IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD RECOGNISE AS THE DRAG ASS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT NOW THE SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY LATERS SEIZED ALL UP THAT IS CAPABLE OF BEING TURNED INTO ABOUT HALF A TON OF CRYSTAL METHAMPHETAMINE AND WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN
THAT TRANSLATES TO THREE POINT SIX MILLION INDIVIDUAL HITS AT THE STREET LEVEL AND THAT HAS A STREET VALUE OF ONE POINT TWO SIX BILLION AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS SO IT'S A PHENOMENAL SEIZURE BY A STRAY ALIEN POLICE HERE IS IT IS IT WIDELY USED IN AUSTRALIAN ONE PRESUME SO IF THERE'S THIS SORT OF MARKET FOR IT
YES WE'VE HAD QUITE A SIGNIFICANT UPTAKE IN THE USE OF ICE IN RECENT YEARS AND IT'S THE FOCUS OF QUIET CONCERTED ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND BY HEALTH CARE AGENCIES IN AUSTRALIA TO TRY AND RAISE AWARENESS OF HOW DESTRUCTIVE A DRUG IT CAN BE IT CURRENTLY IT'S ESTIMATED THERE ARE AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ICE USERS IN AUSTRALIA SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE POINT SIX MILLION HITS
THIS IS AN AWFULLY BIG DENT IN WHAT IS QUITE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN AUSTRALIA WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN CRIME PARTICULARLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DRIVEN BY ICE AND SORRY IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THESE TRENDS THAT HE'S GRIPPING THE SOCIAL IMAGINATION HERE AND ALSO IF YOU SEE IF YOU'RE TALKING OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY LITRES GIVEN THE SIZE OF A A GEL IMPLANT IN A PADDED BRA ON THAT'S A BIG CONTAINER

SO QUITE INNOCUOUS LOOKING MATERIALS ITEMS BUT WHEN YOU SAW THE VOLUME OF CRAFT GLUE AND BRAS ON THIS TABLE AND THEN WE WERE TOLD THIS WAS JUST A FIFTH OF WHAT POLICE SAY IS IT'S QUITE ASTOUNDING QUITE ASTOUNDING AT THIS CRIMINAL NETWORK HAD THE GUMPTION TO TRY AND BRING THE SEEM TO AUSTRALIA WHERE LET'S FACE IT WE HAVE SOME OF THE STRICTEST OUR BORDER CONTROL MEASURES IN THE WORLD JESSICA KID THANKS VERY MUCH
TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN HUNDREDS OF HOUSES WHICH FERMENTED BUILT FOR OLD PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES HAD BEEN DELAYED OR SCRAPPED ALTOGETHER FOLLOWING A GOVERNMENT DECISION DID CUT HOUSING BENEFIT IN LAST YEAR'S AUTUMN STATEMENT THE CHANCELLOR HAD ANNOUNCED THAT TENANTS IN SOCIAL HOUSING WOULD ONLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SAME HOUSING BENEFIT AS THOSE RENTING FROM
PRIVATE LANDLORDS WILL NOW SEVERAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION SAY THEY CAN'T GO AHEAD WITH EXTENSIVE SHELTERED HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE THE SKINNED AND NOT FINANCIALLY VIABLE SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL BECOMING REPORTS

TWENTY FIVE TO EIGHT BACK IN THE LAST CENTURY WE PROBABLY DIAL NINE NINE NINE IS SUMMER WAS REALLY SICK AT HOME AND WE COULDN'T GET A DOCTOR THEN UNDER THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT N.H.S. DIRECT WAS BROUGHT IN THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL PROVE TO BE TOO EXPENSIVE AND ANOTHER NEW SYSTEM CAME IN TWO YEARS AGO ONE ONE ONE AND THAT ACCORDING TO LABOUR IS SO BAD IT IS NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE ONE HOW THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO CARRY OUT ITS OWN INVESTIGATION IT'S BEEN PUSHED INTO IT
BY AN INVESTIGATION BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE DAILY MAIL YESTERDAY IT'S FRONT PAGE SHOWED TWO PICTURES OF CALL HANDLERS LITERALLY ASLEEP ON THE JOB TODAY IT HAS A PICTURE OF TEENAGERS AT THE CENTRE WHO HAD NO TRAINING IN HOW TO HANDLE CALLERS AND THERE'S WORSE HERE'S PART OF WHAT SARAH WHO WAS A SENIOR CALL ADVISER AT ONE ONE ONE TOLD THE MAIL HAVE WORDS HAVE VOICED BY AN ACTOR
I'LL NEVER FORGET A NIGHT I WAS LEFT ON MY OWN WITH NO NURSE OR PARAMEDIC IN A ONE ONE ONE CALL CENTRE COVERING THE WHOLE OF DORSET
I HAVE NO MEDICAL TRAINING BUT I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARE OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH NO SUPPORT
I CALLED THE MOST SENIOR MANAGER ON DUTY HE WAS ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY IN DEVON AND TOLD THEM I HAD NO MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL TO TURN TO HE SAYS YOU'LL BE FINE JUST CARRY ON
MINUTES LATER I GOT A CALL FROM A WOMAN WHO'S ELDERLY HUSBAND WAS NOT BREATHING OR CONSCIOUS THE WOMEN WAS IN FLOODS OF TEARS AND SAID SHE WAS NOT SURE WHETHER HER HUSBAND HAD AGREED TO HAVE A DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDER PUT IN PLACE OR NOT
NO IDEA WHAT TO DO I KNEW HE WOULD DIE IF I DIDN'T SEND THE AMBULANCE ON THE OTHER HAND I KNEW IT WOULD CAUSE HUGE DISTRESS TO THE FAMILY TO HAVE TEAMS OF PARAMEDICS JUMPING ALL OVER SOMEONE AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE WHEN THEY WOULD WANT IT TO BE DIGNIFIED
IT WAS A HORRENDOUS SITUATION TO BE IN AND I HAD NO ONE TO ASK FOR ADVICE
I SENT THE AMBULANCE IN THE END AND I NEVER FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAN BUT I WAS ANGRY AND VERY DISTRESSED TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE ME WITH NO MEDICAL TRAINING IN THAT SITUATION IF COMPLETELY UNSAFE FOR THE PUBLIC
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS FAR FROM UNUSUAL ONE ONE ONE IN THE SOUTH WEST
WHEN YOU HEAR POLITICIANS TALKING ABOUT ONE ONE ONE THEY TALK ABOUT TEAMS OF HIGHLY TRAINED EXPERTS SUPPORTED AT ALL TIMES BY DOCTORS AND NURSES
IN MY EXPERIENCE THAT IMAGE IS QUITE SIMPLY JUST A DREAM WELL I'M JOINED BY A GEEZER LA STEWART WHO IS THE M.P. WAS MADE A MINISTER BASICALLY I SUPPOSE THE STEWARD TO SET UP N.H.S. DIRECT DID
AND IT WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF A LABOUR GOVERNMENT MAKING UNPRECEDENTED AND INVESTMENT IN THE HEALTH SERVICE
AND SO THE WAY WE DELIVER THE SERVICE ALSO HAS TO CHANGE IT HAS TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE IT HAS TO BE TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND IT HAS TO
FIND THAT HALFWAY HOUSE BETWEEN TAKING YOU SERVE TO ANY
AND GETTING ADVICE AND THE KEY TO THAT WAS THAT WHEN YOU PICKED UP THE PHONE YOU DIDN'T JUST HAVE A MATRIX YOU YOU WEREN'T JUST GUIDED TO SOMEWHERE ELSE HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS IN FRONT OF YOU YOU HAD TO ASK ALL OF THEM IN ORDER
BUT THE REAL DIFFERENCE WAS THAT THE PART OF THE TRAINING OF A NURSE WAS THAT THEY WOULD SPEND PART IN THE CALL CENTRE SO THESE WERE MEDICS MEDICALLY TRAINED PEOPLE WHO CONTINUE TO BE IN THE SERVICE
AND I THINK THAT WAS A BIG BIG DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IF WHAT YOU'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT IS THEY SET OFF
IT'S WHICH SIMPLY DON'T TAKE YOU ANYWHERE BUT DO YOU THINK THAT WHOEVER'S ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE CAN GIVE YOU SOME PROPER ADVICE IT'S THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO BECAUSE AS I SAID A MINUTE AGO IT WAS EXPENSIVE WASN'T IT N.H.S. DIRECT IT WAS EXPENSIVE BUT IF YOU WERE TO COMPARE IT WITH WHAT HAPPENED SUBSEQUENTLY THAT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE TAKING THEMSELVES TO ANY
KEEPS GOING UP AND UP AND UP IN THE LONG TERM I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS EXPENSIVE IT IS A WAY FORWARD BECAUSE WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE IF I'M HER FATHER
A SATURDAY NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WITH A CHILD AND I WANT ADVICE
WHERE DO I TURN N.H.S. DIRECT MEANT YOU HAD A NURSE ON THE END WHO WOULD RING YOU BACK AN HOUR LATER TWO HOURS LATER AND THAT'S REALLY THE CHOICE WE'VE GOT TO MAKE
GOING TO BE TERRIBLY DIFFICULT THOUGH ISN'T IT TO GO BACK TO THAT GIVEN THAT MONEY IS IN SHORT SUPPLY AND IF YOU SPEND A BIT MORE ON SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT TO SPEND A BIT LESS ON SOMETHING ELSE AND WELL YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM OR A POLITICIAN IT'S TRICKY
BUT WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IF YOU IF YOU THINK MEDICAL CARE SHOULD BE DELIVERED SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THEN
THAT SOMETHING LIKE N.H.S. DIRECT HAS TO BE A VITAL PART OF THE DELIVERY OR ELSE HE WILL SIMPLY HAVE TO THOSE WHO CAN PAY AND GO AND TAKE THEM TO THE HOSPITAL OR BUY THEIR WAY OUT OF THE SYSTEM ALL PEOPLE GET NEGLECTED
AND THE BIG THING ABOUT N.H.S. DIRECT WAS THAT HE'D ACTUALLY REACHED POPULATION GROUPS WHO NORMALLY WOULDN'T GO INTO HER DOCTOR SO DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR PARTY THAT JEREMY CORBIN SHOULD SAY IF ELECTED WE WILL BRING BACK N.H.S. DIRECT KNOWS WHAT'S IF DIRECT IF THREE ELECTED YOU COME BACK AND SGW GO BACK TO THE SPIRIT OF N.H.S. DIRECT WE NO NO WHICH MEANT IN SOME AREAS LIKE RURAL AREAS SUIT YOU YOU'D HAVE JUST THE PHONE SERVICE
IN THE BIG CITIES WE CO LOCATED WALK IN CENTRES WITH ANY DEPARTMENT YOU GO BACK TO SAYING WHATEVER YOUR LOCATION WHAT IS THE MEDICALLY SAFEST AND QUICKEST ACCESS TO ADVICE RIGHT SO IT MIGHT NOT BE N.H.S. DIRECT IT MIGHT BE A VARIATION ON THAT THEME IT MIGHT EVEN BE A REFINEMENT OF ONE ONE ONE
THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHOEVER IS AT THE END OF THE PHONE IS NOT TRUST A CALL HANDLER OR SOMEONE WHO DIRECTS YOU TO YOUR NEAREST THAT'S WHERE THE COST COMES IN ISN'T IT IT IS INDEED BUT THAT'S WHERE THE WHOLE POINT OF THE SERVICE IS IT HIS MEDICAL EXPERTISE WHICH GUIDED TO THE NEXT APPROPRIATE STEP OR ELSE ALL YOU WILL HAVE IS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SIMPLY GOING AND TAKING THE TESTS
STUART THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS TWENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA IS ANALYSED IN MANY OF THEM THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE PROSPECT OF A TEMPORARY TRUCE APPEARS AS DISTANT AS EVER WITH FIERCE FIGHTING AT A NUMBER OF FLASHPOINTS AND CONTINUED AIR STRIPES IT POINTS OUT THE KURDISH FORCES ARE NOW IN THE ASCENDANT IN NORTHERN SYRIA WHICH HAS ENRAGED TURKEY THE PAPER SAYS THE SUCCESS OF THE KURDS IS DOWN TO RUSSIAN BOMBING OF TURKISH SUPPORTED REBEL GROUPS
THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE RESULT OF THE RUSSIAN INTERVENTION WHICH STARTED IN SEPTEMBER HAS BEEN A WEAKENING OF NON I S. REBEL GROUPS IT REPORTS THAT REGIME FORCES ARE NOW PUSHING FORWARD ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS RETAKING HALF THE PROVINCE ON THE TACKIER AND CUTTING OFF A LEOPARD
EXPRESSES MY CAMERA'S BEEN ACCUSED OF CONNING VOTERS AHEAD OF A POSSIBLE DEAL AFTER OFFICIALS CONCEDED THAT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO ALTER THE TERMS OF ANY AGREEMENT FOLLOWING THE REFERENDUM THE PAPER SAYS ANY DEAL WE HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY ONE EMMY PEAS TO ENSURE THE MEASURES COME INTO FORCE IF BRITAIN FACE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION GORDON BROWN HAS WRITTEN A PIECE FOR THE MIRROR SELLING OUT THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE HEATERS BRITAIN NEEDS TO LEAD EUROPE ON ISSUES SUCH AS TAKING ON RUSSIA PROVIDING A COUNTERWEIGHT TO BALANCE
THE DOMINANCE OF GERMANY AND CHAMPIONING A MORE DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABLE AND COMPETITIVE EUROPE HE HAS BRITAIN SHOULD REMAIN AN OUTWARD LOOKING NATION AND NOT CHOOSE SPLENDID ISOLATION THE GUARDIAN REPORTS AT THE REST OF EUROPE'S GETTING COLD FEET ABOUT DAVID CAMERON'S PROPOSED DEAL WITH RESERVATIONS ARE BEING VOICED FROM POLAND TO PORTUGAL POINTS OUT THAT OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE FACING BIGGER CRISES INCLUDING IMMIGRATION
AND THE FUTURE OF THE EURO AND HE QUOTE AN OFFICIAL IN BRUSSELS AS SAYING THAT E.U. MEMBER STATES ARE FRUSTRATED THAT THEY'RE HAVING TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR THE SAKE OF U.K. PARTY POLITICS
THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAS BAD NEWS FOR WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS TERRORISTS CRIMINALS AND BIG SPENDERS IT REPORTS THAT THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IS PROPOSING TO WITHDRAW THEIR FIVE HUNDRED EURO NOTE WHICH IS WORTH ABOUT THREE HUNDRED NINETY POUNDS IT SAYS THAT WHILE MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PURPLE NOTES THEY ARE THE CURRENCY OF CHOICE FOR CRIMINAL AND TERRORIST NETWORKS IT'S ALSO CLAIMED THAT MOST OF THE FIVE OF DURA NOTES AND CIRCULATION ARE NOT IN THE EUROZONE AT ALL BUT IN RUSSIA
THE TIME WAS THERE A LEAD WITH A CANCER STORY THAT SAYS THERE HAS BEEN A BREAKTHROUGH THAT REALLY DOES OFFER HOPE OF A CURE THE NEW TREATMENT USES GENETICALLY MODIFIED CELLS WHICH STAY IN A PERSON'S BLOOD FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS AND KILL THE CANCER CELLS THE TIME SAYS THE RESEARCH COULD LEAD TO A LIFELONG IMMUNITY AGAINST CANCER RELAPSE THE MIRROR REPORTS OF THE TREATMENT LEFT NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF PATIENTS WHO WERE TREATED FREE OF CANCER AFTER THEY'D BEEN TILL THEY HAD ONLY MONTHS TO LIVE
THE LEAD SCIENTIST INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH IS PROFESSOR STANLEY REDOUBT OF THE FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTRE IN SEATTLE WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TAKING T. CELLS IMMUNE CELLS FROM THE PATIENTS AND WERE GENETICALLY MODIFYING THEM SO THAT THEY EXPRESS A RECEPTOR
WOULD TARGET A MOLECULE I'M CANCER CELLS I SAW ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS PROCESS DOES GENETICALLY RE PROGRAMMES THE T. CELL TO SEEKER AND RECOGNISE AND DESTROY THE PATIENT'S TUMOUR CELLS RIGHT SO IS THAT IT IS THAT THE NEWS WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR DOCTOR ALAN OF CANCER RESEARCH U.K. IS WITH ME IS IT A CURE FOR CANCER
THIS IS VERY STILL VERY EARLY STAGES BUT HE'S QUITE EXCITING NEW TECHNIQUE IT'S STILL WHAT WE ARE DOING IS THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING THIS TECHNIQUE OF AS AS YOU JUST HEARD ON THAT CLIP OF TRYING TO RE ENGINEER OUR IMMUNE CELLS AND THE KIND OF SUSS SORT OF SWITCH THEIR TARGETING APPEARS LATCHES ON TO CANCER CELLS WE TRIED IT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND REALLY THERE HAS BEEN SOME REAL SUCCESS IN THESE PARTICULAR TYPES OF BLOOD SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS STEP SO BECAUSE EFFECTIVELY WERE GENETICALLY MODIFYING THE CELLS WAS A LOT OF OPEN QUESTIONS ABOUT
HOW CAN WE MAKE IT BETTER HOW D'YOU MAKE IT SAFER MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE SO WHAT HIS RESEARCH AS DINERS IS KEELEY THEY'VE FOCUSED ON HER NEW CELLS THAT THEY THINK WILL LAST
FOR A VERY LONG TIME RIGHT YOU DON'T JUST STICK HIM IN THEY DO THEIR JOB AND DIE OFF THEY CAN DO THAT BUT THIS IS THE QUESTION OF BECAUSE WE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS FOR HER FOR THAT LONG WE'VE ONLY BEEN TRYING THIS FOR ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS HAS REALLY BEEN AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO HOW HOW LONG THIS WILL STAY EFFECT BECAUSE WE JUST HAVEN'T NO SO THIS IS THE PROPOSITION CAN WE MAKE THIS AS LONG LASTING AS POSSIBLE AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE DONE THAT WELL IT STILL HE'S ONLY BEEN TREATING FOR
WITHIN HIS LAST YEAR AS WE HAVEN'T SEEN WEATHER NOT THE SPALL LAST INPATIENTS BUT FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES THEY'VE DONE THEY THINK THEY THINK THEY CAN GET THAT RIGHT NOW THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT AS WE SPEAK PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND WITH THOSE HOLES IN THEM AND THEY ARE ALIVE AND KICKING AND DOING THE JOB THEY'RE MEANT TO DO KILLING OFF CANCER CELLS SO WE'VE HAD THESE TRIALS IN THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF BLOOD CANCER NOW IMPORTANTLY WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT
STANDARD TREATMENT CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY ARE USUALLY VERY EFFECTIVE ON THIS CANCER'S THESE ARE ONLY FOR PATIENTS WITH THAT TREATMENT HAS FAILED FOR THEM SO THAT'S A VERY SORE AND GROOM BUT IT'S FANTASTIC TO HAVE POTENTIALLY ANOTHER WEAPON IN OUR ARSENAL AS A BACK UP PLAN RIGHT BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
TINKERING WITH CELLS OF THE WAY YOU JUST DESCRIBED COULD BE USED TO TO ATTACK ANY KENT'S SIR THAT'S EXACTLY THE QUESTION SO THAT'S THE THING WITH THE BLOOD CANCERS IS THAT SORT OF
OUR BEST TARGET OUR BEST OPTION FOR THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF ENGINEERING BECAUSE WE STICK THESE IMMUNE CELLS AND THEY PATROL THE BLOOD IN THE BODY SO IF YOUR CANCER'S ALREADY IN THE BLOOD
IT'S AN EASY TARGET RIGHT WE'VE GOT LIVER CANCER LIVER CANCER'S MUD DIFFICULT HOW DO WE GET THE T. CELLS TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO AND ALSO WHAT'S THE RIGHT TARGET THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S KEY TO THIS TREATMENT FOR EVERY CANCER TYPE YOU NEED A SPECIFIC TARGET TO LATCH ON TO WHAT THEY'VE USED HERE IS A MOLECULE THAT HANGS ON ON
THE B. CELLS IN THE BODY IS THE CELLS ARE A CANCEROUS IN THESE PATIENTS SO FORTUNATELY WERE REALLY LUCKY THAT THERE IS A MOLECULE THAT'S ONLY FOUND ON THOSE CELLS ARE NOT ANY OTHER CELLS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE WIPE OUT ONLY CANCEROUS CELLS BUT WE TALK A LONG CANCER OR A LIVER CANCER YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ONLY ON THE CANCEROUS CELLS NOT ORGAN
COS YOU CAN'T YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO LAST IT RIGHT BUT AS YOU SAY A VERY PROMISING VERY BUT I'M SEEING STEP ALAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU IT'S THIRTY MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A BRIGHTON STUDIO THIS MORNING IS TIM TIM STANLEY WHO IS A HISTORIAN AND WRITER FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING I'M SAD TO SAY THAT MY FATHER DIED LAST YEAR HE WAS TAKEN INTO A HOSPICE IN EARLY DECEMBER SUFFERING FROM THE FINAL STAGES OF TERMINAL CANCER
THE LAST LUCID CONVERSATION WE HAD WAS ABOUT FAITH HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN VISITED BY THE FAMILY PASTA AND THAT THEY HAD PRAYED TOGETHER MY FATHER WHO WAS ESSENTIALLY AN ATHEIST SAID THAT HE FELT CHEATED WHY
BECAUSE HIS PRAYER ACHIEVE NOTHING HE HAD ASKED TO BE CURED AND GOD DIDN'T ANSWER
THIS IS THE TOUGHEST QUESTION YOU COMPOSED TO A CHRISTIAN WHY DOESN'T GOD HELP US WHEN WE NEED HIM THE MOST JESUS HIMSELF SAID ON THE CROSS MY GOD WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME
I CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE PEOPLE ASKING THAT QUESTION RIGHT NOW IN SYRIA AS THEIR TOWNS ARE BOMBED AND THEIR CHILDREN ARE KILLED OR IN SOUTH AMERICA WITH A TERRIBLE ZEKE A VIRUS IS TAKING ITS TOLL
NOT ONLY AS THE QUESTION DIFFICULT IN ITSELF BUT ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW ONE FRAMES THE ANSWER AND YOU CANNOT PATRONISE PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING DEATH THEY'RE UNDERGOING EXPERIENCE WE CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO COMPREHEND
I TOLD MY FATHER THAT I UNDERSTOOD HIS DOUBTS THERE'S A GREAT LINE IN A PLAY BY PETER BARNES IN WHICH A CHARACTER WHO BELIEVES HE WAS THE REINCARNATION OF JESUS EXPLAINS THAT HE CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION BECAUSE WHENEVER HE PRAYED HE REALISED HE WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF
MY FATHER LAUGHED AT THAT HE HAD A VERY BLACK SENSE OF HUMOUR
BUT I SAID SOMETIMES WE THINK GOD ISN'T TALKING TO US WHEN IN FACT HE IS
GOD DIDN'T CURE MY FATHER PEOPLE FALL ILL AND DIE AND THAT SADLY IS THE CYCLE OF LIFE BUT I BELIEVE GOD DID SENT IN THE PASTA TO OFFER WORDS OF COMFORT
HE SENT HIM DOCTORS AND NURSES TO HELP EASE THE PAIN HE SENT FRIENDS TO SHARE MEMORIES AND SAY GOODBYE AND GOD SENT HIM HIS OWN SON JESUS
WHATEVER PAIN MY FATHER EXPERIENCE JESUS SUFFERED TOO WHEN HE WAS CRUCIFIED
WE CHRISTIANS ALSO BELIEVE THAT HE OFFERS US LIFE AFTER DEATH IN OTHER WORDS IN LAYMAN'S TERMS HE OFFERS US HOPE
I SAID TO MY FATHER I THINK THAT GOD DOES ANSWER OUR PRAYERS IT'S JUST THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS HEAR BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LISTENING I SUSPECT THAT MY FATHER DIDN'T BELIEVE IN GOD BUT I HOPE THAT WHAT I SAID BROUGHT HIM SOME COMFORT
SHORTLY AFTER THAT CONVERSATION MY FATHER SLIPPED INTO A COMA AND A FEW DAYS LATER HE DIED
I WAS WITH HIM AT TWO IN THE MORNING WHEN HE TOOK HIS LAST BREATH I HOPE THAT HE HEARD ME PRAYING FOR HIM AT THE END AND THAT HE KNEW HE WAS NEVER ALONE
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH TIM STANLEY THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT THE RISK OF BREAK UP IS REAL THAT'S WHAT DONALD TUSK WARNED YESTERDAY HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL AND THE MAN OVERSEEING BRITAIN'S NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE E.U. HE URGED EUROPEAN LEADERS TO HANDLE THE SITUATION WITH CARE
HIS COMMENTS FOLLOWING MEETING YESTERDAY OF HUNGARY POLAND THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND SLOVAKIA A GROUP WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE UNHAPPY WITH BRITAIN'S PROPOSAL TO LIMIT WELFARE PAYMENTS TO E.U. MIGRANTS A GROUP WHO COULD SCUPPER ANY DEAL AT THE LAST MINUTE
WELL WE'RE IN A MOMENT WE'LL SPEAK TO SYED COME OUT HE'S A CONSERVATIVE M.E.P. AND LEADS THE EUROPEAN CONSERVATISM REFORMIST GROUP IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT BUT WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY THOMAS PROUD WHO IS THE CZECH EUROPE MINISTER AND HIS PRIME MINISTERS' MEETING DOM TUSKER LATER TODAY GOOD MORNING TO YOU
DONE US PROUD IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND POSSIBLY OTHER COUNTRIES COULD AT THIS LATE STAGE BLOCK THE DEAL
I WANT TO DO ANYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP U.K. INDIE IL IT COURSE
O.K. AND LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE WHICH I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO HIS CHILD BENEFITS YOU CAN ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT CHILD BENEFITS ARE PAID FROM THE U.K. BACK TO CHILDREN IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC AT THE RATE THAT FOR COST OF LIVING BUT NOT IF OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE SPAIN OR FRANCE OR GERMANY ALSO SAY HOLD ON A SECOND WE WANT TO DO THE SAME THING
IS DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO FIND A WAY TO ENSURE THAT THAT DOESN'T SPREAD TO OTHER COUNTRIES
O.K. I'M GONNA BRING INSIDE CARMEL HERE BECAUSE IN A SENSE IT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THIS DEAL IT WAS ASSUMING THERE'S A VOTE A VOTE YES TO STAY IN THE E.U. AND THE REFEREE IS THEN WHEN IT GOES TO THE PARLIAMENT THAT THAT SORT OF AFFECT COULD HAPPEN ISN'T IT
THAT'S RIGHT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN QUITE CLEAR ABOUT IS THAT ACTUALLY REFUTE THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT STILL HAS A RIGHT TO CHANGE SOME OF LEGISLATION CONCERNING MIGRANT BENEFITS ANOTHER ISSUES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DEAL THAT BRITISH PEOPLE VOTE ON IT'S THE SAME DEAL WITH THAT IS ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE FINAL DEAL YOU CAN PARLIAMENT DOESN'T MAKE IT THE CHANGES WHAT HAD HOW CAN YOU DO THAT WELL THAT'S ONE REASON IS THAT DAVID CAMERON IS IN BRUSSELS TODAY HE'S TALKING TO THE LEADERS OF THE BIG EUROPE A PARLIAMENT PARLIAMENTARY GROUPS
THERE ARE EIGHT PARLIAMENTARY GROUPS I HAVEN'T TO BE LEADER OF THE THIRD LARGEST PARLIAMENTARY GROUP AND HE'S TALKING TO LEADERS OF THE OTHER BIG POLLEN TO GROUPS TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT HE HAS SUPPORT TO GET THESE CHANGES THROUGH THE PARLIAMENT SO WHAT THAT HE CAN HE CAN GET SOME SORT OF GUARANTEES THERE WILL IF THIS COMES BEFORE YOUR PARLIAMENT A LATER DATE THERE WILL NOT BE AMENDMENT
THAT EFFECTIVELY CHANGE IT BEYOND RECOGNITION THAT'S CLEARLY WHAT WHY HE'S HERE AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN THE BRITISH PEOPLE VOTE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THERE ARE VOTING ON THAT SHE HELD THE DEAL WE'LL END UP NOT A VOTE THAT NOT A VOTE THAT COULD A CHEAPER DETAILS COULD BE CHANGED AND I SUPPOSE TO MOST PROUD FOR YOU AND FOR THOSE ALSO IN THE OTHER VISIT GRAD GROUPS ALL COUNTRIES THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU TOO
WE'RE NOT WILLING TO HAVE THE WHOLE SOCIAL SYSTEM OF BEING CHASED BY DEBT BUT I WONDER IF THERE IS ENOUGH TO SATISFY YOU WHAT SORT OF DEAL COULD BE DONE THAT WOULD SATISFY YOU ON THAT THE FULL THURSDAY NIGHT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THE SAME ARRANGEMENT AS FORTY DESCRIPTION IN OR A BENEFIT TO PROPOSE A SCREW
TO APPLY ONLY TO YOU
WE NEED THE VERY SAME GUARANTEES ALSO FOOTIE CHILD BENEFITS A DICTATOR AND THAT APPLIES TO ALL LIVING
O.K. SO HAVE YOU SAID TO YOUR DAD ON THE IN WORK BENEFITS IT ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE WHO ARRIVED IN THE WHO HAVE YET TO ARRIVE IN THE U.K. EXACTLY I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO IT WOULD IT CHANGE ITS RICH CREATIVELY KEPT PEOPLE ALREADY IN THE U.K. CAN PLAY ACCORDING TO THE EXISTING RULES AND PEOPLE WILL COME LATER ALREADY KNOW WOULDN'T YOU ROSA HAVE YOU GOT THAT NAILED DOWN IT IS INDEED PROPOSALS WE UNDERSTAND
BUT YOU'VE GONE FROM DO YOU THINK THERE IS A DANGER OF EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TUSK HAS WARNED OF THAT ACTUALLY THE RISK A BREAK UP ISRAEL THAT WE COULD BE IN A SITUATION WHERE PERHAPS POSSIBLY THIS DEAL IS WATERED DOWN SO MUCH HE'S CHANGED THAT IT DOESN'T SATISFY THE BRITISH PEOPLE
WE HOPE IS THAT WITH THE U.K. AND DAVID CAMERON'S DEMANDS WITH THE SHOE WOULD I DO
O.K. AND THERE ARE OF COURSE OTHER COUNTRIES WHO WHETHER IT'S ONE SUGGESTION THIS MORNING IS THAT GREECE COULD COME IN AT THIS LATE STAGE AND SAY HOLD ON A SEC WE'VE GOT SOME ISSUES ABOUT REFUGEES AND IF YOU DON'T SORT THOSE OUT WE COULD BE A PROBLEM
SYED COME ON DO YOU SEE THAT BEING AN ISSUE CLEARLY MANY WAYS I THINK THEY WERE CAMERAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED WHEN HE MADE THE SPEECH HAD BLOOMBERG HER SOMETIME AGO AT MELTS AND THE REFORM AGENDA HE WAS HOPING THAT OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD COME IN WITH THEIR OWN IDEAS AND THIS WILL BE ALL ABOUT EUROPEAN REFORM BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE Y. YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE E.U. NEEDS TO REFORM IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE CHALLENGES IT FACES AND HUG STRUGGLING TO FACE THOSE CHALLENGES
AND WHAT THIS HAS BECOME OVER TIME AS THE OTHER SPEAKERS BEEN SAYING IT'S BECOME AN ISSUE OF BRITISH REFORM THAT'S QUITE SAD THAT THIS IS HAPPENING LATER IN THE DAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT DAVID CAMERON ALWAYS INTENDED FOR IT TO BE ABOUT EUROPEAN REFORM NOT JUST ABOUT THE U.K.'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U.
O.K. THOMAS CROWD I MEAN YOU SAY THAT THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO KEEP THE U.K. IN THE E.U. BUT THERE MAY BE MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK ENOUGH DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU YOU LONG BEEN SORT OF SEMI ATTACHED THIS IS POSSIBLY TIME TO SAY IF YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THESE PRINCIPLES GO AND I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY DANGEROUS DECISION I'M GOING TO INSTIL FEAR OF AN OWL
WITH BRITISH FOCUSING ALL THE DISCUSSIONS WHEN THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY THROUGHOUT SO MANY BENEFITS U.K. BRINGS HIM BUT ALSO BELIEVED MANY IT'S YOU CAN YOU GET BY BEING A MEMBER THOMAS BROWSER UNDERSIDE COME ON THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THANK YOU
LETTERS TO AND FROM WANT OF US TO ANOTHER THIS ONE CALLED AND RACKET I'VE GOT A COLD AGAIN YEAH IT IS REALLY REALLY CHILLY THIS MORNING BUT OF COURSE WHEN WE GET THOSE CHILLY CLEAR FROSTY MORNINGS THE AFTERNOON QUITE OFTEN LOOKS PRETTY GOOD AND THAT'S HOW IT'S FORECAST TO STAY ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES IT'S FORECAST TO BE CRISP AND SUNNY AT LEAST MOST OF THE DAY I THINK THE BEST OF THE WEATHER WILL BE ACROSS EASTERN AND CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY
THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES WILL BE A LITTLE ON THE LOW SIDE BUT NOT DESPERATELY LOW AROUND SIX OR SEVEN DEGREES I'M SURE WE CAN COPE WITH THAT BUT SKIES WILL TURN A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOUDY ACROSS WALES AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY AND THAT IS BECAUSE OUR WEATHER FRONT IS APPROACHING US AND IT'S ALREADY BRINGING WINDIER AND WETTER AND CLOUDIER WEATHER TO THE FAR NORTH WEST OF THE U.K. SAYS I SPEAK IN THE WESTERN ISLES OF SCOTLAND IT'S RAINING QUITE HEAVILY THERE'S A GALE BLOWING AND ALL OF THIS WET AND WINDY WEATHER WILL BE REACHING
WESTERN SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND EVENTUALLY THE LOWLANDS OF SCOTLAND TOO BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE MIDDLE PARTS OF THE AFTERNOON SIR QUITE A SPLIT IN OUR WEATHER TODAY THE NORTH WEST STAYS VERY WET WINDY AND CLOUDY WHERE'S THE BULK OF ENGLAND AND WALES KEEPS THAT CRISP WINTER SUNSHINE
TONIGHT THE BAND OF RAIN AND WIND THAT WE'VE GOT IN THE FAR NORTH WEST AT THE MOMENT WILL START CROSSING OTHER PARTS OF THE U.K. SO OVERNIGHT TONIGHT THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND WALES WILL GET THE RING TWO AND BY TOMORROW MORNING IT SHOULD BE NUDGING INTO PARTS OF CENTRAL ENGLAND AS WELL AND OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE COULD SEE A LITTLE BIT OF SLEET AND SNOW ALMOST ANYWHERE ACROSS ENGLAND AS WE SEE THAT TRANSITION FROM THE COLD WEATHER THAT WE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW TO MILDER CONDITIONS
THANKS VERY MUCH NOW THERE'S BEEN READIER FOR COMMISSIONS SUSAN CALMAN TO FIND WAYS TO KEEP OUR COOL LAST WEEK I WAS SO TENSE I FIND MYSELF GETTING ANGRY AT A PINCH
BECAUSE IT WAS TAUNTING ME SUSAN CALMAN TRIES NEW WAYS TO UNWIND AND DE AND WATCHING FIND PRETTY IS WORTH ABOUT THREE DAYS' HOLIDAY REALLY WE'RE NOT ME SO YOUR MOST ROMANTIC HIDEAWAY
WITH HELP FROM ANDY SALTZMAN JOHN'S REALLY MORE AND MURIEL GRAY AND YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF TIME TO MAKE DECISIONS RIGHT OBVIOUSLY
YOU'RE PUTTING IT OFF
NEW COMEDY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR SUSAN CALMAN KEEP CALMAN CARRY ON STARTING ON THURSDAY EVENING AT SIX THIRTY
LATER ON THIS PROGRAMME NO PLATFORM IN WHY DID THEY DO IT AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN CELIBACY IN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH WE SHALL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WELL AND THAT B. B. C. THREE GOES ONLINE TODAY WE'LL LOOK BACK AT SOME MEMORABLE MOMENTS OF LIVE TELEVISION YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY THE SIXTEENTH OF FEBRUARY THE HEADLINES DAVID CAMERON IS ABOUT TO ARRIVE IN BRUSSELS FOR TALKS WITH SENIOR FIGURES AT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ABOUT HIS RENEGOTIATION OF BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP THE ENERGY COMPANY E.D.F. HAS ANNOUNCED IT'S EXTENDING THE WORKING LIFE OF FOUR NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS IN THE U.K.
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE BRITAIN IN BLOOM AWARDS WILL INCLUDE A PRIZE FOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE RECOVERED FROM DEVASTATING FLOODS THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY NEIL SLEET DAVID CAMERON IS PREPARING FOR A CRUCIAL TALKS IN BRUSSELS AT WHICH HE HOPES TO WIN MORE SUPPORT FOR HIS PROPOSALS TO CHANGE BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION E.U. LEADERS WILL MEET ON THURSDAY TO TRY TO HAMMER OUT A DEAL BUT THERE ARE SIGNS THAT MANY COUNTRIES STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE DETAILS
LAST NIGHT HOWEVER DOWNING STREET SAID MISTER CAMERON AT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS ROUND HAD MADE GOOD PROGRESS AT A MEETING IN PARIS AND HAD AGREED THAT THERE WAS NOW A FIRM BASIS FOR AN AGREEMENT FROM BRUSSELS CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS
DAVID CAMERON BEGINS HIS DAY AT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WHERE HE NEEDS TO WIN SOME FRIENDS THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT HIS PROPOSED DEAL WITH THE REST OF THE E.U. WILL BE LEGALLY BINDING BUT SEVERAL PARTS OF IT WILL REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT WILL NEED THE SUPPORT OF ANY PEAS AND OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES AFTER A BRITISH REFERENDUM MY CAMERON WANTS GUARANTEES THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO PIN DOWN
AT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION THE PRIME MINISTER WILL MEET PRESIDENT YOUNGER WHO SAID YESTERDAY THAT HE EXPECTED THE INDEX ATION OF CHILD BENEFIT TO BE AT THE HEART OF DEBATE THIS WEEK THE DRAFT DEAL SAYS CHILD BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO MIGRANT WORKERS IN THE U.K. SHOULD BE MADE ACCORDING TO THE COST OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THE CHILDREN ACTUALLY LIVE
BUT EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE INSISTING THAT THOSE REDUCTION SHOULD ONLY APPLIED TO NEW APPLICANTS NOT TO EXISTING BENEFICIARIES IN A FURTHER COMPLICATION THE EASTERN EUROPEANS WANT ASSURANCES THAT OTHER COUNTRIES WON'T BE ALLOWED TO DEMAND THE SAME REDUCTIONS IN PAYMENTS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED TO THE U.K.
FOUR OF BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS HAD TO STAY OPEN BEYOND THEIR SCHEDULED CLOSURE DATE THE FRENCH ENERGY COMPANY E.D.F. SAYS HE CHEM ONE AND TWO IN LANCASHIRE HARTLEPOOL IN TEESIDE AND TORN S. IN EAST LOTHIAN WILL HAVE THEIR LIVES EXTENDED BY BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN YEARS BEFORE PLANT STARTED GENERATING POWER IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES MORE DETAILS FROM OUR INDUSTRY CORRESPONDENT JOHN MOYLAN
IT HAD BEEN ASSUMED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS WOULD START TO BE DECOMMISSIONED IN THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS BUT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS GIVEN FOR PLANTS A NEW LEASE OF LIFE
HE SOMEONE AND HARTLE POOL WILL STAY OPEN AN EXTRA FIVE YEARS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR
HE'S TWO AND TORE NESS WILL GO ON EVEN LONGER A FURTHER SEVEN YEARS PROVIDING POWER UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY THERE FOR PLANTS EMPLOY TWO THOUSAND PERMANENT STAFF AND SUPPLIES ELECTRICITY TO AROUND A QUARTER OF THE U.K.'S HOMES
THE F. ENERGY SAYS THE MOVE FOLLOWS EXTENSIVE TECHNICAL AND SAFETY REVIEWS BUT AMID GROWING CONCERNS OF A POSSIBLE POWER SHORTAGES IT MEANS THERE WILL BE CONSIDERABLY MORE CAPACITY ON THE SYSTEM WELL INTO THE TWENTY TWENTIES THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE IS DUE TO MEET THE WIDOW OF LORD BRITTEN TO DISCUSS SCOTLAND YARD'S INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE LATE CONSERVATIVE PEER
POLICE INTERVIEWED LORD BRITTEN ABOUT HISTORICAL ALLEGATION OF RAPE BUT HE DIED IN JANUARY LAST YEAR WITHOUT KNOWING THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE THE FORMER HOME SECRETARY WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED AS PART OF OPERATION MIDLAND THE INQUIRY INTO CLAIMS OF A PAEDOPHILE RING AT THE HEART OF WESTMINSTER HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
THE MEETING BETWEEN LADY BRITAIN SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE WILL BE HELD IN PRIVATE THIS AFTERNOON THE COMMISSIONER WILL BE ASKED TO EXPLAIN WHY IT TOOK SCOTLAND YARD SO LONG TO CONCLUDE ITS INVESTIGATION INTO AN ALLEGATION LOW BRITAIN RAPED HER NINETEEN YEAR OLD WOMAN IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN BRITAIN WAS INTERVIEWED ABOUT THE CLAIM WHICH HE DENIED BUT DIED BEFORE POLICE FORMALLY CLOSE THE CASE
IN A LETTER LAST YEAR A SENIOR OFFICER APOLOGISED TO LADY BRITAIN CENTRE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD EARLIER THAT HAD HE BEEN ALIVE LORD BRITAIN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED
IT'S UNDERSTOOD SIR BERNARD WILL ALSO BE ASKED ABOUT OPERATION MIDLAND IT'S BEEN INVESTIGATING ABUSE ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING A NUMBER OF POLITICIANS INCLUDING LORD BRITAIN WHOSE HOMES WERE SEARCHED AS PART OF THE INQUIRY TWO MONTHS AFTER HIS DEATH
THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD HAS CAST DOUBT ON WHETHER A CEASEFIRE PROPOSED TO LATER THIS WEEK CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IT WAS AGREED BY WORLD POWERS OF THE SECURITY MEETING IN MUNICH LAST WEEK BUT IN A TELEVISED ANNOUNCEMENT PRESIDENT ASAD SAID THE AGREEMENT DID NOT GUARANTEE THAT ALL SIDES WOULD STOP USING WEAPONS
IT HAD BEEN AN ORDER ON YOUR LITTLE OFFER CLOCK KNOCK IT OUT OF SMALL BUT UNTIL NOW WE HEAR THEM REQUESTING A CEASEFIRE WITHIN A WEEK O.K. THEN WHO IS CAPABLE OF BRINGING TOGETHER ALL THESE CONDITIONS WITHIN A WEEK NO ONE WHO WILL SPEAK TO THE TERRORISTS OF A TERRORIST ORGANISATION REFUSED TO ADHERE TO THE CEASEFIRE WHO WILL MAKE THEM ACCOUNTABLE WHO AS THEY SAY WILL BOMB THEM IF THEY WANTED TO BOMB THEM WHERE CAN WE FIND THEM WHERE ARE THEY FROM THE PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE ALL THIS IS DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT
A SENIOR OFFICIAL AT UNICEF HAS CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HOLD THE WARRING FACTIONS IN SYRIA TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT HE CALLED THE SYSTEMATIC ABUSE OF HUMANITARIAN LAWS DOCTOR PETERS A LLAMA SAID YESTERDAY'S ATTACKS ON TWO SCHOOLS AND FOUR HOSPITALS MARKED A NEW LEVEL OF BRUTALITY IN THE CONFLICT HE TOLD US THOSE RESPONSIBLE MAY HAVE COMMITTED WAR CRIMES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY AT THE MOMENT I'LL GO SO WHAT WE CAN
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THEY MAY HAVE MADE A BREAKTHROUGH WITH WHAT THEY'RE DESCRIBING AS A POTENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY CANCER TREATMENT STUDIES PRESENTED AT A WASHINGTON CONFERENCE SUGGEST THERE WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED SUCCESS RATE OF MORE THAN NINETY PER CENT IN ACHIEVING COMPLETE REMISSION IN TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED BLOOD CANCERS BUT ALAN WORSLEY FROM CANCER RESEARCH U.K. TOLD THIS PROGRAMME IT WAS TOO EARLY TO SAY WHETHER THE EFFECTS WOULD BE PERMANENT
BECAUSE WE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS FOR HER FOR THAT LONG WE'VE ONLY BEEN TRYING THIS FOR ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS HAS REALLY BEEN AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO HOW HOW LONG THIS WILL STAY EFFECT NOW IMPORTANTLY WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT STANDARD TREATMENT CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY ARE USUALLY VERY EFFECTIVE ON THIS CANCER'S THESE ARE ONLY FOR PATIENTS WITH THAT TREATMENT HAS FAILED FOR THEM SO THAT'S A VERY SORE AND GROOM BUT IT'S FANTASTIC TO HAVE POTENTIALLY ANOTHER WEAPON IN OUR ARSENAL
BROADCASTING OF B. B. C. THREE ON TELEVISION HAS COME TO AN END THE FINAL PROGRAMME TO BE TRANSMITTED ON T. V. WAS ONE OF THE STATION'S BIGGEST HITS GAVIN AND STACEY THE STATION WILL NOW ONLY BE AVAILABLE ONLINE AS OUR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT DAVID SINITTA REPORTS
FROM NOW ON B. B. C. THREES OUTPUT OF YOUTH ORIENTED COMEDY DRAMA DOCUMENTARIES WILL APPEAR ON ITS WEBSITE THE EYE PLAYER AND YOUTUBE THE CLOSURE OF THE T.V. CHANNEL HAS BROUGHT PROTESTS THAT IT'S A CUT TO OUTPUT AIMED AT YOUNGER AUDIENCES BUT THE B. B. C. SAYS IT WANTS TO DIRECT PROGRAMMES TO WHERE PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY VIEWING
HOWEVER THE BUDGET FOR B. B. C. THREE HAS BEEN CUT AND PROGRAMMES SUCH AS DON'T TELL THE BRIDE AND FAMILY GUY HAVE ALREADY BEEN BOUGHT UP BY OTHER BROADCASTERS BUT THE B. B. C. SAYS THERE WILL BE AROUND FOUR HOURS OF NEW CONTENT EACH WEEK AND ALL THE MAIN PROGRAMMES WILL ALSO BE EVENTUALLY BROADCAST AND EITHER B. B. C. ONE OR TWO
IT'S BEEN A SUCCESSFUL NIGHT FOR BRITISH MUSICIANS AT THE GRAMMY AWARDS IN LOS ANGELES ED SHEERAN ONE SONG OF THE YEAR AND BEST POP SOLO PERFORMANCE FOR THINKING OUT LOUD MARK RONSON PICKED UP RECORD OF THE YEAR WHILE MUSE WON THE BEST ROCK ALBUM FOR DRONES THE COVETED BEST ALBUM TITLE WENT TO THE AMERICAN SINGER TAYLOR SWIFT HERE'S A LOS ANGELES CORRESPONDENT JAMES COOK
SWIFT OPENED THE SHOW AND BY THE TIME IT ENDED SHE HAD THREE GRAMMYS INCLUDING ALBUM OF THE YEAR FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE RAPPER KENDRICK LAMAR WHO BLEND SOLD JAZZ AND HIP HOP WON FIVE AWARDS RECORD OF THE YEAR WENT TO BRITISH PRODUCER AND D.J. MARK RONSON FOR HIS COLLABORATION WITH BRUNO MARS SUN UPTOWN FUNK HAVING WAITED FOR YEARS TO WIN ONE GRAMMY ED SHEERAN WENT HOME WITH TWO PARENTS HAVE FLOWN FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS THERE COMES THE GRAMMYS EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND EVERY TIME I LOSE THEY GO
MAYBE NEXT YEAR BUT IN A YEAR WHEN YOU'RE SICK LOST SO MANY STARS THE NIGHT WAS ALL ABOUT THE TRIBUTES INCLUDING LADY GAGA AS PSYCHEDELIC FAREWELL MEET THE BOY
COMMUNITIES WHOSE GARDENS WERE RAVAGED BY THIS WINTER'S FLOODS ARE TO BE CONSIDERED FOR A SPECIAL BRITAIN IN BLOOM AWARD TO RECOGNISE THE EFFORTS THEY'VE MADE TO BOUNCE BACK THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY WILL HAVE A NEW CATEGORY THIS YEAR FOR TOWNS OR VILLAGES AND CITIES THAT HAVE OVERCOME ADVERSITY REPORTING FROM ABERDEEN COLIN BLANE
ABERDEEN HAS BEEN A FREQUENT WINNER SINCE BRITAIN IN BLOOM BEGAN IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THE CITY'S TAKEN ELEVEN GOLD AWARDS FOR ITS PARKS GARDENS AND FLORAL DISPLAYS
THIS YEAR THERE WERE HIGH HOPES THAT SEATON PARK NEXT TO ABERDEEN'S MEDIEVAL CATHEDRAL WOULD HELP PROPEL THE CITY TO ANOTHER AWARD
THEN IN JANUARY STORM FRANK BROUGHT TORRENTIAL RAIN TO NORTH EAST SCOTLAND
THE RIVERS DEE AND DON BURST THEIR BANKS THE FLOODING AT SEATON PARK WAS DESCRIBED BY OFFICIALS AS THE WORST FOR SEVENTY YEARS AND SOME AREAS ARE STILL UNDER WATER
IN AUGUST JUDGING WILL TAKE PLACE ACROSS BRITAIN FOR COMMUNITIES WHICH HAVE PRODUCED GREAT GARDENS AFTER TERRIBLE FLOODING
COLIN BLAINE REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT IT'S ONLY FIVE DAYS AGO THAT FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA ANNOUNCED THEY HAD REACHED AGREEMENT ON A CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA AND DECLARE THAT HE SHOULD COME INTO EFFECT WITHIN A WEEK IT WON'T INDEED THE PICTURE IS LOOKING EVEN BLEAKER IF THAT'S POSSIBLE YESTERDAY FOR HOSPITALS AND TWO SCHOOLS WERE BOMBED AND IT SEEMS RUSSIA IS TO BLAME
THERE'S A GROWING VIEW THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT CEASEFIRE AT ALL I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT TO CHRISTOPHER HILL WHO WAS AN AMERICAN AMBASSADOR IN THE MIDDLE EASTERN HELP NEGOTIATE THE BOSNIA PEACE AGREEMENT I SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT YOU HAD TO CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE FIRST IF YOU WANTED TO END THE FIGHTING
MY OWN VIEWERS IT SHE REALLY SHOULD BE THE LAST STEP IF YOU GO BACK TO BARS WE HAD A PRETTY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT FUTURE POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE AT BARS
AND SO THE CEASEFIRE ACTUALLY BECAUSE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT NO ONE WANTS TO BE THE LAST TO DIE IN A CIVIL WAR ESPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S ALL HEADING THE PROBLEM WITH SYRIA OF COURSE IS FIRST OF ALL IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY BRUTAL EXTREMELY BRUTAL ESPECIALLY INNOCENT MILLIONS AND NOW EVEN PEOPLE IN HOSPITALS THAT THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDABLE DESIRE OR STOP THE SHOOTING
BUT I THINK WHAT REALLY HOW THE WHOLE THING IS THE DIFFICULTY OF FIGURING OUT WHAT CERIA IS GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT ELECTIONS ELECTIONS ARE VERY GOOD AT FIGURING OUT HOW A MAJORITY RULE SHOULD SHOULD WORK BUT ELECTIONS ARE VERY BAD IN TERMS OF HELPING THE MINORITIES FIGURE OUT HOW THEIR RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BE PROTECTED SO THE MORE YOU TALK ABOUT ELECTIONS
AH THAT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL GOOD TO WENT THOSE ELECTIONS BUT FOR THE MANY PEOPLES IN SYRIA THE CURDS THE OWL WRITES THE CHRISTIANS DREW BRUGES THEY KNOW THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO WIN THE ELECTIONS ELECTIONS WILL SHOW THAT THEY'RE HAVE THE MINORITIES THEY ARE SO I THINK TO SOME EXTENT FROM MY EXPERIENCE THIS IS NOT GUARD IN THE PROPER SEQUENCE
ISN'T THERE A PROBLEM WITH THE ATTITUDE THE APPROACH THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS TAKEN BRITAIN FOR THAT MATTER WHICH IS THAT A SAD HAS TO GO THE FACT IS THAT SO LONG AS RUSSIA IS SUPPORTING ASAD HE IS NOT GOING TO GO AND RUSSIA IS GOING TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING HIM
YOU YOU'VE GOT AT RUSSIA BETTER CLAIM TO BEING ON THE GROUND ON THE REST OF US DO AFTER ALL THEY HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT'S A MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS IT'S INVITED THEM INTO THEIR COUNTRY SO I THINK IF YOU WIN THE HISTORIANS FINALLY LOOK AT THIS BLOODY NURSE AND SYRIA ARE THEY WILL ARGUE THAT PROBABLY THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WAS MADE EARLIER ON WHEN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND THE U.K. SO THEY WOULD NOT DEAL WITH US
START TO SAY HER SOUNDS A GOOD GUY BUT HE CERTAINLY A REPRESENTS A FACTION THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS PEACE PROCESS IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO GET ANYWHERE BUT I THINK THERE WAS A VIEW THAT SOMEHOW WE WERE A LITTLE SLOW AND SAYING WILL BARK MUST LEAVE EGYPT AND SO THEY THOUGHT THEY'D MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BY SAYING I SADE MOSCOW
THINKING THAT PERHAPS HE WOULD LEAVE IN ABOUT A WEEK'S LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER LEADERS DURING THEIR SPRING BUT HE'S STILL THERE AND IS STILL THERE FOR A LOT OF COMPLEX REASONS HAVING TO DO WITH THE MULTI ETHNICITY A SECTARIAN NATURE OF THE SYRIAN STATE
SO SHOULD OBAMA RING POOH DINNERS O.K. VLADIMIR LET'S DO A DEAL
WELL I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU IS A PERSON WHO IS HARD TO DO A DEAL WORDS SO I WAS BEING SATIRICAL YES YES I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WERE NERVOUS IT SEEMS HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN TORMENT IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE FINDING PEACE SETTLEMENT
BUT I DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE GROUND WORK DONE WITH THE RATIONS ARE IN FRANKLY WITH THE IRANI
ARE BOTH COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE VERY IMPORTANT INTERESTS IN THE SYRIAN STATE AND FOR US TO JUST SAY ALL THERE SHOULD JUST BE AN ELECTION WHERE WE KNOW THE SOON KNEES WILL WIN BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE MAJORITY AND WE DON'T
TRY TO EXPLAIN HOW THESE RIGHTS AND THE MINORITIES ARE GOING TO BE SAFEGUARDED IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK SO I THINK IT DOES NEED TO BE A LOT MORE WORK WORK TO GET A CONSENSUS ON WHAT SERIOUS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE AND WHEN EVERYONE QANNICK GETS IT WILL CLIMB OUT OF THEIR FOXHOLE START ONE HE'D BE THE LAST TO DIE IN A CIVIL WAR
AND FROM WHAT YOU KNOW OF IT AND IT IS OF COURSE A CONFUSED PICTURE BUT ARE YOU SATISFIED THAT THE RUSSIANS DID BOMB AT THOSE HOSPITALS YOU KNOW ALL THE RATIONS HISTORY FIRST OF ALL ARE BEING VERY ACCURATE I THINK WHAT IS PARTICULARLY IN THEIR ARTILLERY OR IN THIS CASE AIR BOMBARDMENT WHAT IS PARTICULARLY WORRY HERE OR WAS IT JUST ONE HOSPITAL THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS
A DELIBERATE EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE WAR ARE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ULTERIOR OR EXPLANATION OF THIS BUT I MUST SAY FINGERS ARE POINTING DIRECTLY AT THE RUSSIAN AIR FORCE ROAD THERE FOR A WAR CRIME
AH IF THERE WAS A DELIBERATE EFFORT TO TARGET HOSPITALS ARE WERE WOUNDED WARRIOR'S TRIANGLE I SING
WHERE THERE ARE DOCTORS I THINK YOU COULD CERTAINLY MAKE THE CASE FOR HER BEING A WAR
THAT WAS AMBASSADOR CHRIS HILL FORMER AMERICAN DIPLOMAT I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY THE FORMER CABINET MINISTER ANDREW MITCHELL WHO WAS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT A WAR CRIME THE BOMBING OF THE HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS YES GOOD MORNING IT'S CERTAINLY A WAR CRIME THE RUSSIAN AIR FORCE HAVE NOW HIPS THIRTY HOSPITALS IN SYRIA OF WHICH ONLY ONE IS IN AN EYESORE
AREA EVERYONE KNEW AND MET SATS OF FONTINA IS IS CAREFUL TO MAKE CLAIRE WHETHER PEOPLE ARE ON THE GROUND TO ALL THE COMBATANTS EVERYONE KNEW THAT THIS WAS A MEDI SETS OFF FRONTIER HOSPITAL AND UNDOUBTEDLY THIS IS A BREACH OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE RUSSIANS ARE GUILTY OF THAT AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WE CAN DO TO PUNISH THEM THERE IS EFFECTIVELY NOTHING WE CAN DO AT THE MOMENT BUT THEY CAN BE HELD TO ACCOUNT IN THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED NATIONS WHICH WAS SET UP TO TRY AND COMBAT THIS SORT OF INTERNATIONAL ANARCHY
OF WHICH OF COURSE RUSSIA IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE MEMBER OF THE PERMANENT FIVE NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED NATIONS WILL BE HORRIFIED AND APPALLED AT THESE RUSSIAN ACTIONS AGAINST INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND FOR RUSSIA'S REPUTATION A FUTURE FOR RUSSIA'S ROLE IN THE U.N. THIS HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT
AMBASSADOR HILL MADE AN INTERESTING POINT DIDN'T HE WHEN HE SAID THAT THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD NOR A SENIOR AMERICAN SAILORS BEFORE PERHAPS THEY HAD THAT THE UNITED STATES AND THIS COUNTRY MADE A GRAVE ERROR IN SUPPORTING THE REMOVAL AND CALLING FOR THE REMOVAL OF A SAD RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND MAKING THAT THE PRECONDITION FOR EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWED
I'M AFRAID THAT IS THAT IS CORRECT COFAIDH A MAN THE VERY DISTINGUISHED FORMER GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS CAME FORWARD WITH HIS PLAN ASKED BY THE U.N. GENERAL SECRETARY TO DO SO PART OF THAT PLAN WAS TO SAY THAT ASAD IS PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE AND THEREFORE BY DEFINITION IS PART OF THE SOLUTION AND THEREFORE HE MUST BE INCLUDED IN NEGOTIATIONS AND THAT WAS VETOED BY THE AMERICANS AND THE LAST BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO THAT WAS AN ERROR IT WAS CERTAINLY AN ERROR AND SINCE THAT TIME
THE POSITION OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT WE HAVE THESE FLEDGLING NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON IN GENEVA WHICH ARE STALLED BUT AT LEAST ALL THE PARTIES ARE THERE IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER AND EVERYONE ACCEPTS THAT AS SAD AS PART OF THE PROBLEM HE IS THERE AT LEAST IN SPIRIT OUT THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND WE HAVE A WE ARE FACING HAVE BEEN PACING FOR A LONG TIME THE GREATEST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS OF THE CENTURY PERHAPS SINCE THE LAST WAR
WHAT IS TO BE DONE ANGELA MERKEL IS TALKING ABOUT NO FLY ZONES DOES SHE HAVE A POINT THE PROBLEM WITH NO FLY ZONES HAS FRANKLY THAT NO ONE IS GOING TO ENFORCE IT WE HAVE TALKED IN THE PAST ABOUT SAFE HAVENS AND SAFE HAVENS AS AN INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTIONS A NO FLY ZONE IS CLEARLY TAKING PART IN THE CONTEST BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE RUSSIANS IN THE SYRIAN
THERE'S THE SYRIAN THEREFORE IT HAS TO BE THE POLICE YES THEY ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE FLYING THESE COMBAT MISSION SO IT WOULD BE AN INTERVENTION IN THE BATTLE WHEREAS WHEREAS A SAFE HAVEN IS IS A HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION AND IS THEREFORE OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ORDER AND I THINK THE SUGGESTION OF A NO FLY ZONE WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY HELP THOSE WHO ARE CAUGHT IN DREADFUL JEOPARDY
ON THE GROUND IS RATHER LIKE THE CEASEFIRE A PIE IN THE SKY IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND WE NEED TO RECOGNISE THAT MEANWHILE THERE NOW SIX MILLION PEOPLE INSIDE SYRIA AND SIX MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE BORDERS OF SYRIA WHO ARE DISPLACED
FOOD ISN'T GETTING THROUGH THE MEDIA HAS FOCUSED QUITE RIGHTLY ON THE AREA OF MY DIAL THAT'S FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE BESIEGED MANY OF WHOM ARE STARVING BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S FIFTEEN OTHER BESIEGED AREAS ENCOMPASSING THREE MILLION PEOPLE AND AS AS WINTER GOES ON THERE'S A LACK OF MEDICINE OR LACK OF FOOD OR LACK OF SHELTER THE PERIL IN WHICH THESE PEOPLE ARE NOW PLACED HIS EXTRAORDINARY AND CATASTROPHIC BUT HOW DO YOU
HAVE A SAFE HAVEN HOW DO YOU POLICE A SAFE HAVEN IF THE WARRING PARTIES WON'T AGREE WHERE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS HAS TO EXPRESS ITS DETERMINATION TO PROTECT THESE VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND YOU'RE THERE IT CANNOT GO AHEAD WITHOUT AT LEAST RUSSIAN PASSIVE ACQUIESCENCE THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARDS
BUT BUT THESE AREN'T DEALING WITH THE SYMPTOMS YOU ONLY DEAL WITH THE CAUSES IF YOU PURSUE THE POLITICAL TRACK WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING NOW IN GENEVA THAT'S THE WAY TO GET REAL PROGRESS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CAUGHT ON THE GROUND AND YOU SAY UNDERWAY IN GENEVA THAT'S ARGUABLE ISN'T IT I MEAN WE SEE THINGS HAPPENING WE SAW THAT
DECLARATION LAST WEEKEND OF THE CEASEFIRE THERE TALKING NOTHING'S HAPPENING WITH THOSE TO OUR SEPARATE THINGS OF COURSE INDEED THE CEASEFIRE WAS WAS AGREED IN MUNICH BUT WAS THAT A MISTAKE BY THE WAY DO YOU KNOW ANY ANYTHING ANY NEGOTIATIONS LIKE THAT ARE AH TO BE TO BE DESIRED BUT I I THINK THAT THERE'S NO LINK BETWEEN THE ENGINE AND THE WHEELS THE DECLARATION OF OUR POTENTIAL CEASEFIRE SOMETIME AHEAD
LAST WEEK IS A DECLARATION OF INTENT BUT IT'S UNLIKELY AS THINGS STAND TO HAVE ANY EFFECT AT ALL ON THE GROUND WHAT'S GOING ON IN GENEVA AT LEAST STEFFAN DE DURER HAS WAS VERY ABLE U.N. OFFICIAL HAS HAS GOT THE PARTIES THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY MAKING ANY PROGRESS AT THE MOMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NEEDS TO KEEP ITS KEEP ITS FEET ON THE THROATS OF ALL THE PARTIES WHO ARE THEY THOSE COUNTRIES LIKE IRAN AND SAUDI AND AMERICA AND RUSSIA WHO HAVE INFLUENCE OVER THE PART OF GENEVA
NEED TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD SO THERE IS A POLITICAL TRACK AND IT DOES START TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS ISN'T IT FANCIFUL EVEN TO IMAGINE THAT A COUNTRY LIKE RUSSIA WHICH IS YOU'VE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS IS GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES WOULD SUDDENLY TURN AROUND AND SAY O.K. WE WILL WILL WILL GO ALONG WITH THIS PROCESS WE WILL DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY AND THAT IS INCREASING
PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THIS IS THE WAY THEY DO IT THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT US OUT UNTIL THEY'VE GOT WHAT THEY WANT THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A SAD AND THEY ARE THEY ARE DOING SO IN THE WEST OF SYRIA
ALL THE TIME DIFFERENT DEFENDING THEIR INTEREST THERE AND OF COURSE THEY HAVE SERIOUS ONE WATER NAVAL FACILITIES THERE AS WELL BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN TO MOVE THEIR POLITICAL TRACK FORWARD AND THE RUSSIANS KNOW THAT SO AT SOME POINT THERE IS GOING TO BE PROGRESS BUT WE MUST DO AS AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BRING FORWARD THE TIME WHEN THAT PROGRESS STARTS TO BE MADE AND THE KEY POINT IS WHAT HAPPENS IN GENEVA
ANDREW MITCHELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT IF YOU SWITCH TO B. B. C. THREE TODAY YOU WILL BE INFORMED THAT IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE CHANNEL YOU CAN ONLY DO SO ONLINE BUT THEN THE CHANNEL IS AIMED AT YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIXTEEN AND THIRTY FOUR AND AS THEY SEEM TO WATCH EVERYTHING ONLINE DOES IT MATTER WELL GET THE VIEW OF A COUPLE OF VIEWERS IN A MOMENT FIRST THEY WILL LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THE KEY MOMENTS IN TELEVISION HISTORY JEAN SEATON THE OFFICIAL HAS JOINED THE B.B.C. TAKES A LOOK BACK FOR US
HELLO RADIO AND HIM IF YOU DO IT TELEVISION FROM THE STUDIOS
IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX THE B.B.C. SET UP THEIR FIRST DAILY TELEVISION STATION
AND THAT WENT ON BROADCASTING TO ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE UNTIL NINETEEN THIRTY NINE WHEN THE STATION WAS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF THE WAR
THE VISION OF BRITAIN IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX B. BRING PROGRAMMES LIKE MUFFIN THE MULE
FIRST EVER TELEVISED OLYMPICS IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE CORONATION
THAT TELL
HERE IN THE CROWN OF AN EVERLASTING KINGDOM BY THE GIFT OF HIM TOWARDS KINGDOM IN FOR EVER
ON THAT DAY EVERYBODY WHO COULD TRIED TO FIND A TELEVISION TO HUDDLE TOGETHER
THE NINETEEN SIXTIES TELEVISION HAD BECOME A HUGE POWER IN THE LAND IT WAS THE THING WHERE EVERYBODY WATCH THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME TO GO
BOBBY MOORE LEADING THEM UP IN THE ROYAL BOX TO RECEIVE RECEIVERS JEWELLERY MAKE UP AND THE WINNER'S MEDAL
AUDIENCE WAS GOING TO BEGIN TO
DEVELOP AND CHANGE INTO MUCH SMALLER AUDIENCES A COMPOSITE DID FIRST OF ALL THAT CAME SATELLITE TELEVISION
THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS ALLOW ALL OF THE BROADCASTERS IN THE WORLD TO GET TOGETHER TO MAKE THINGS LIKE AT THE LIVE AID CONCERT
A MILLION PEOPLE FROM SIXTY COUNTRIES WATCHED THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME AND THEN THINGS LIKE THE INTERNET BECOME TWO OF THREE
B.B.C. IAD NOW AND MOBILE TABLET T.V. AND GAMES CONSOLES ARE YOU COULD YOU OPPORTUNITY OF PEOPLE WATCHING WHAT THEY WANTED AT DIFFERENT TIMES FROM OTHER PEOPLE BUT ALTHOUGH IT BECOMES MORE PERSONALISED IT STILL THE CASE THAT OCCASIONALLY
VERY LARGE EVENT CAN GATHERERS ALL TOGETHER TO SEE SOMETHING TOGETHER AT THE SAME
JEAN SEATON LOOKING BACK FOR US WELL WE'RE JOINED ON THE LINE FROM STEAK BY FAMINE A A SUGAR WHO WAS A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD STUDENT STUDYING AT KEELE UNIVERSITY AND I MEAN GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING YOU HAVE BEEN A FAN OF B.B.C. THREE YES I HAVE YEAH SO WILL YOU JUST WATCH IT ONLINE
I THINK I'LL GIVE IT A TRY DO YOU WATCHED TELEVISION ANYWAY OR DO YOU TEND TO WATCH EITHER OF THE LAST YEARS HAVE STOPPED WATCHING TELEVISION BECAUSE THINGS LIKE THAT FLICKS BECOME BECOMES OF MORE APPARENT BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY GIVE HIM A TRY ONLINE JUST BECAUSE I USED TO WATCH IT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND I'M MORE OF A VOICE THEY CRY
BUT IN A SENSE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY WHO RARELY SWITCHES THE BOX ON IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT DOES MAKE YOU TURN TO THE TELEVISION YEAH BIG NEWS THINGS LIKE FOOTBALL DOCTOR WHO A BIG DOCTOR WHO FAN AND THINGS LIKE THAT REALLY
AND YOU WOULD WATCH THOSE AS THEY'RE BEING BROADCAST POINT IT OF YOUR CHOOSING BUT I MEAN WHAT OF COURSE ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT THINGS ABOUT B. B. C. THREE IS ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS IS THEY WON'T HAVE AS MUCH MONEY I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THE SPEND ON YOUNGER VIEWERS REDUCED BY THIRTY MILLION AND THAT COULD DAMAGE WHAT THEY'RE BROADCASTING THAT I SUPPOSE IS GOING TO BE THE TEST WELL THE B. B. C. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAD TO DO MORE WITH LESS AND I THINK THEY'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT SO MOVING ON LINES PROBABLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE ALLOW
SO C. THREE TO GO A NEW CONTENT DIRECTIONS AND THEY MAYBE COULDN'T PREVIOUSLY I MEAN ACTUALLY I HAD A THOUGHT THAT THE NINE P.M. WATERSHED FOR EXAMPLE ONLY REALLY I THINK I ONLY REALLY APPLIES TO TERRESTRIAL PROGRAMMING ONLINE IN THE B. B. C. COULD DO WHAT THEY WANTED WITH B. B. C. THREE
THINK NOT CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT THE WATCH I DO IT'S THINGS LIKE THAT JUST INNOVATIONS
THEY CAN MAKE A BIT OF THAT IN THE PROGRAMMES YOU START OF COURSE THE ONES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON TERRESTRIAL ANYWAY I MEAN OR ON THE OTHER CHANNELS DOCTOR WHO MATCH OF THE DAY I MEAN THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT THINGS THAT ARE FROM B.B.C. OR THINGS LIKE THE REAL HUSTLE LITTLE BRITAIN IN REPLAYS OF PROGRAMMES THAT WERE PLAYED ON B. B. C. THREE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ARE WHAT PEOPLE MY AGE TEND TO LIKE
AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT JAMES CORDEN DAVID THEY ALL STARTED ON B. B. C. THREE THEY DID ALL START ON THE NECK AND THEY'D BUY THE SHIFTED ALL LEFT BUT I MEAN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF B. B. C. THREE HE'S NEVER REALLY BEEN IN DOWN IN MY OPINION I MEAN IT'S A CHANNEL HAS ALWAYS BEEN AIMED AT PEOPLE MY AGE AND I THINK HE'S DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF IT AND MOVING ON LINE HONEY HELP TO ENSURE THAT AND SO CAN YOU SEE A REASON TO PAY FOR THE LICENCE FEE IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING A TELEVISION UM
THIS IS THE ONE TO ASK A STUDENT UP YEAH IT IS PROBABLY MAYBE IF I WASN'T A UNI I WOULD PAY THE LICENCE FEE BUT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I AM AT UNI IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD TO JUSTIFY THE COST

THE TIME IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE FROWN COWLING WHO HOLDS AN ELECTED POSITION IN THE NATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS REFUSED TO ACCEPT AN INVITATION TO SPEAK AN EVENT AT CANTERBURY CHRIST CHURCH UNIVERSITY LAST NIGHT BECAUSE THE GAY RIGHTS CAMPAIGNER PETER TATCHELL WAS ALSO SPEAKING
IT'S THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF NO PLATFORM ING REFUSING TO SHARE A PLATFORM WITH SOMEONE HIS VIEWS YOU DON'T LIKE WELL TOM BATEMAN WAS ENCOUNTERED LAST NIGHT TO HEAR WHAT WAS BEHIND THEM
HERE WE ARE IN A LECTURE THEATRE AT CANTERBURY CHRIST CHURCH UNIVERSITY AND PROJECTED ON THE WALL BEHIND WHERE THE SPEAKERS ARE ABOUT TO SEE IT IS A BIG POSTER WITH A HUGE RAINBOW COLOURED FIST RAISED INTO THE AIR NEXT TO IT IT SAYS PUBLIC DISCUSSION RE RADICALISING QUEERS SHOULD WE TOE THE LINE OR CAUSE A STIR
GENEROUS INTRODUCTION YES IT'S VERY NICE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE INSTITUTION BY INVITATION
PETER TATCHELL SPEECH HERE MADE WAVES WELL BEFORE HE GOT IN FRONT OF THE MICROPHONE THE EVENTS ORGANISERS HAD OFFERED A SEAT ON THE PANEL TO FRAN COWLING THE LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER OFFICER FOR THE NATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS SHE EMAILED THEM BACK SAYING SHE COULDN'T SHARE A PLATFORM WITH PETER TATCHELL ACCUSING HIM OF HAVING SUPPORTED TRANS PHOBIA
HATRED TOWARDS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE SHE REFERRED TO MISTER TATCHELL SIGNING LAST YEAR OF AN OPEN LETTER WHICH CRITICISED A GROWING TREND AMONG STUDENT GROUPS IN TRYING TO BAN SPEAKERS WHOSE FUSE THEY FOUND OFFENSIVE AMONG THOSE WHO'D FACED ATTEMPTS AT SO CALLED NO PLATT FORMING THE FEMINIST WRITER GERMAINE GREER WHO OUTRAGED MANY TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AFTER SHE OPINED THAT MEN LOPPING OFF PART OF THEIR ANATOMY AND WEARING A DRESS DIDN'T MAKE THEM A WOMAN I SIGNED A LETTER TO BE ABSURD
DEFENDING FREE SPEECH NOT ENDORSING ANYONE'S VIEWS
FRAN CANNING CLAIMS THAT LETTER DEFENDED THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO BE QUOTE OPENLY TRANS PHOBIC AND QUOTE INCITE VIOLENCE AGAINST TRANS PEOPLE
THE LETTER DID NO SUCH THING IT WAS SIMPLY ABOUT THE ISSUE OF FREE SPEECH EVEN THOUGH I PERSONALLY STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH GERMAINE GRIER'S VIEWS AND HAVE SAID SO MANY MANY TIMES
SUPPOSE THERE'S A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT HERE AS WELL THOUGH THAT IS TO RAISE THAT ISSUE IN PUBLIC TO GET PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT'S ACHIEVED EXACTLY THAT HASN'T AND SHE'S DONE THAT BY REFUSING TO SHARE A PLATFORM WITH SOMEONE SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T AGREE WITH WELL IT MAY HAVE ACHIEVED PUBLICITY AND AWARENESS ABOUT THE ISSUE BUT IT'S AN ABSURD WAY TO GARDENING TO ESSENCE ROUNDS PERSON I AM QUALIFIED
SHARING A PLA
A LONG HISTORIES NO PLATFORM IN FIRST AS AN ANTI FASCIST RESPONSE TO THE NATIONAL FRONT AND LATER THE B.N.P.
BUT MORE RECENTLY IT'S USES BROADENED BECOMING MORE CONTROVERSIAL THE FEMINIST CAMPAIGNER JULIE BINDLE IS STILL THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDENT UNION BAN FOR COMMENTS ABOUT TRANS GENDER PEOPLE IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THE SECULARIST RICHARD DAWKINS WAS RECENTLY UNINVITED FROM SPEAKING AT A U.S. SCIENCE CONFERENCE FOR TWEETING ARE LINKED TO A VIDEO ENTITLED FEMINISTS LOVE IS LA MISSED YOU HELLO PROFESSOR BE SHEARER A PROFESSOR A COMPARATIVE RELIGION GENDER AND SEXUALITY AT UNIVERSITY
I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE OFFICER IS COMING FROM MY FRIENDS COMING FROM IN A SENSE OF TRYING TO PROTECT THE TRANS COMMUNITY ARE HIGHLY VICTIMISED HIGHLY OPPRESSED COMMUNITY TO WHICH I BELONG
THE SADDLE POINT PETER WAS MAKING WAS NOT ABOUT THE TRANS COMMUNITY IT WAS A PINT OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH
WHILE I DISAGREE WITH THIS INTERPRETATION I THINK THERE IS THERE IS GOOD REASON NOT TO PLATFORM JAMAIS ANGRY MY NAME IS BETH RANDALL A STAFF MEMBER SUZY DO YOU I THINK THAT UNIVERSITIES THAT IDEAL OPPORTUNITY FOR INTELLIGENCE
PRODUCTIVE AT ALL I THINK BUT NO PLATFORM IN COULD BE A DANGEROUS WAY OF EXCLUDING VOICES TO ONLY RADICALISED FURTHER IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE WAS VOICES ARE HEARD AND EXCEPTED
TO FURTHER FUEL THE ANTAGONISM I THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER TO TEAR THE CONVERSATION INTO SOMEWHERE IT CAN BE LISTENED TO PROPERLY
TOM BATEMAN'S REPORT FROM CANTERBURY LAST NIGHT WE DID ASK FRANK HOWLING IN THE NATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS FOR AN INTERVIEW I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT THEY KNOW PLATFORM FORMED US
JANE FAY IS A JOURNALIST AND CAMPAIGNER FOR L.G.B.T. RIGHTS AND SHE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH ME NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS A SORT OF INCREASING RELUCTANCE PERHAPS PARTICULARLY AMONG STUDENTS NOT TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION WITH PEOPLE WHOSE VIEWS A DISAGREEMENT NO I KNOW IT'S VERY INTERESTING THE PACKAGE WE JUST HAD BECAUSE YOU INTRODUCED THIS IS A PIECE ABOUT AND OPEN UP FORMING BEING REFUSAL TO SHARE A PLATFORM AT SOMEBODY WHICH I FIND PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE
THERE ARE PEOPLE I PICKED THERE'S NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO WON'T SPEAK WITH BUT THERE'S PROBABLY SOME BUT HISTORICALLY AND OPEN UP FOR ME HAS BEEN ABOUT BANNING PEOPLE FROM SPEAKING AND PETER TATCHELL WAS HISTORICALLY PLATFORMS LAST NIGHT HE GOT SPEAKY GOT SAY WHAT HE WANTED AND HE GOT EXTRA PUBLICITY
BUT TO THE L.G.B.T. ELECTED OFFICIAL FROM THE N.U.S. REFUSED TO SHARE A PLATFORM WITH HER SHE DIDN'T WISH TO I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS VERY STRANGE IT'S ALMOST LIKE THIS YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BOYCOTT CERTAIN GOODS THAT CAMERON'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT
PRESUMABLY IN FUTURE STUDENTS WILL HAVE TO BUY GOODS FROM CERTAIN PLACES IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T WANT CAN IF I CAN GIVE AN EXAMPLE AND IT'S I DID SAY TO PRODUCE THIS WAS NOT THE B.B.C. DID THIS BUT UM A WHILE BACK I WAS ON THE RADIO TALKING ABOUT THE SUICIDE
OF A TRANS PERSON HALFWAY THROUGH THAT THE PRESENTER SHIFTED IT INTO HOW BRAVE I WAS AND THEN TALKING ABOUT MY SEX LIFE AND THEN THEY SORT OF SIDLED HIM WITH AM HAVE YOU EVER DONE IT WITH A MAN I WILL NOT GO ON THAT RADIO SHOW AGAIN I THINK IT'S MY RIGHT NOT TO BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS OFFENSIVE SHALLOWER BUT WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT A CASE LAST NIGHT WHERE YES FRANK HOWLING HE WAS ELECTED BY THE N.U.S. AND SHE EMAILED TO SAY
THAT THIS IS NOT A PERSONAL GRIEVANCE IT'S AN ORGANISATIONAL ISSUE AS HER REPRESENTATIVE THE N.U.S. AS AN ORGANISATION I HAVE TO ABIDE BY MY MEMBERSHIP'S POLICY WHICH STATES I CANNOT AND MUST NOT SHARE A PROP THAT ONE WITH ANYONE WHO MY MEMBERSHIP IS TO BE RACIST NOT TRANSFER IT'S SO BIG AND WE TALK ABOUT PETER TATCHELL I AGREE AND I HAVE ABSOLUTE NO FOR PETER I WOULD SHARE I CAN'T TALK ABOUT WHAT THE N.U.S. HIS POSITION IS BEYOND MY UNDERSTANDING BEING THAT THE N.U.S. DOES NOT HAVE A PARTICULAR POSITION ON TATCHELL IN WHITE HAS A POSITION ON JULIE BINDLE
AND THAT MUST BE BETWEEN FRENEMY N.U.S. BUT I THINK IT'S CONFUSED BECAUSE THEY DID ACTUALLY TELL HIM BUT THIS IS NOT N.U.S. POLICY SO THEY SEEM TO BE SOME CONFUSION WITHIN THERE IT DOES SEEM WEIRD IT'S SORT OF ALMOST SPEAKS TO A CENSORSHIP AMONG STUDENTS AND OR AN INCREASE IN ONE THERE PERHAPS OLDER PEOPLE I KNOW TO BE CONTINUED WITH SIMILAR GENERATION BUT FIND HARD TO UNDERSTAND
NO I MEAN I FIRST ENCOUNTERED TIS A DARE I SAY IT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX ROWERS ARGUING TO LIBERAL PARTY CONFERENCE AGAINST NO PLATFORM ING FORK THEN FOR FASCISTS
AND IT'S GONE ON AND ON AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE NO I MEAN GERMAINE GREER CERTAINLY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT A TRANS ACADEMIC TAKING UP A POST NOW I CAN'T THINK OF A CLEARER INSTANCE OF NO PLATFORM ENGLAND THAT BASICALLY A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW COMPLAINING THERE A SORT OF OLDER GENERATION THEY HAVE NOW DONE THEIR TIME AS ACTIVIST TO MAY THINK THEY HAVE THE FREE
ASK TO SPEAK WHEN AND WHERE THEY WANT AND THEY'RE REALLY UPSET BECAUSE OCCASIONALLY THE YOUNGER GENERATION IT'S DARN UPSTARTS SO WE DON'T SPEAK ALONGSIDE YOU BUT SURELY THERE'S DON UPSTARTS SHOULD SPEAK ALONGSIDE THEM AND ARGUE WITH A VIEW AND WIN THE ARGUMENT NO I'M SORRY MY RONNIE ISN'T THAT THE BUT ISN'T THAT THE BEST WAY TO TO CHANGE THE SIDE IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE SOCIETY MAO DEFEATED ARGUMENT RATHER THAN TO SAY STICK YOUR FINGERS IN YOUR EARS
NO BECAUSE FOR CERTAIN I MEAN AND TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ALLEGEDLY WAS LOW PLAIT NO PLATFORM RECENTLY WAS ALSO ON THE RADIO OR AM I THINK EVEN T. V. LAST WEEK ARGUING FOR NOT ALLOWING HER RUCHE YE THE PICK UP ARTIST AND ALLEGED RAPIST RAPE APOLOGIST INTO THE COUNTRY
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW BEING NO PLATFORM IN THEIR YOUTH WERE SORT OF CAMPAIGNING AGAINST CERTAIN EXPRESSIONS BEING HELD THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS AN ABSOLUTE FREE SPEECH RIGHT BUT ISN'T AND THE POINT IS IT GOING ON HE'S VIRTUALLY NONE OF THESE PEOPLE CLAIMING TO BE NO PLATFORM HAVE BEEN NO PLATFORM IN THE CLASSIC SENSE THEY'VE ALL GOT SAD THOUGHT THEY SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY AND MANY OF THEM HAD MORE PUBLICITY AS A RESULT AND VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE A GREAT SNOOKER PLAYER REFUSES TO POCKET A TEN THOUSAND POUND PRIZE A GREAT FOOTBALLER REFUSES TO SCORE FROM A PENALTY WHAT'S GOING ON WELL MANY FANS ARE VERY CROSS INDEED BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY WERE SHOWING DISRESPECT THEY WERE LEONORE MESSY AND RONNIE O'SULLIVAN O'SULLIVAN SIM WAS REFUSING TO POT THE SHOP THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM THE PERFECT BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN AND THAT BIG PRIZE
JUST HAVE A LOOK AT ME IN THE COMMENTARY BOX OF I'VE PUT TEN FINGERS LOOKED AS THOUGH IT'S TEN THOUSAND
SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T TRY TIMES IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH THIS IS NOT IN THAT WE'VE GOT IT FOR THIS NOT IF THEY FELT IS LIGHT ENOUGH MONEY AS AMAZING
TO LOOK AT THE COOL WE'VE GOT HELLO AND BLESS HIM AFTER LOVE HIM I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST YOU HAVE TO LOVE IT
NOT WHAT EVERYBODY'D HE'D LOVE IT WAS A RESULT OF THAT AFTERWARDS HE EXPLAINED HIS DECISION I KNOW IT'S TEN GRAND I THOUGHT THIS IS TOO TO BOTHER ABOUT THE SAME GROUND I WAS SOMETIMES USED TO MAKE A MAX'S QUITE A MASSIVE ACHIEVEMENT
IF THEY'RE GOING TO PAY YOU TEN GRAND I THINK IT'S WORTH A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT SO ONCE THE PRICE RISES UP A BIT AND I THOUGHT I'LL GO FOR THE ONE FOUR SEVEN ONE FOUR SIX IS JUST AS GOOD
WELL THAT'S WHY HE DID IT LITTLE MESSY'S SIN AGAIN IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT WAS RATHER CASUALLY PASSING TO A TEAM MATE FROM THE PENALTY SPOT GOING TO SHOP REMIT HIMSELF OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS MEANT TO DO RATHER THAN HIMSELF SCORE ENGLAND
BY TAKING THE KICK SO WHAT WERE THEY DOING OR WAS IT JUSTIFIED LET'S ASK TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING WILLIE THORNE A GREAT SNOOKER PLAYER HIMSELF AND SIMON BARNES A GREAT SPORTS WRITER SIMON WHAT DO YOU THINK LES TAKE WILLIE THORNE FIRST LET LET LET LET LET LET'S TAKE A O'SULLIVAN FIRST
WITH THE LEFT HIM FEELING ABOUT THAT IF I'D BEEN A NEW AUDIENCE I'D HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED AND FELT A BIT IT'S REALLY QUITE RIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND RONNIE IF ELEPHANT IT'S SUCH A RARE HEIGHT AN ISLAND WE'VE ALWAYS FOUND IT HARD TO BE AT HOME AND COMFORTABLE IN THE WORLD BUT I'M PREPARED TO FORGIVE HIM TO OVERLOOK IT AND SAY THAT THAT JUST RONNIE THAT'S JUST THE WAY HE IS HE'S AN ODD FELLOW IT'LL MAKE ODD DECISION
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND YEAH THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT IS IT UP I MEAN THE AUDIENCE THE PEOPLE IN THE CROWD WANT TO SEE THIS ONE POOR SEVEN THEY CAN SAY I WAS THERE WHEN WE HAVE TO SET IT UP ABOUT I'VE HAD FINISHED ON THE COMMENTARY BOX AND YOU'LL TALK TO THE PLAYERS WITH ME YOUNG MUM CLEMATIS HAVE GOT AT IT IT SHOULD BE A BIT OF TICKETS FERRIED BACK WHAT ELSE I WANT TO MAKE A WILL THAT MATT PLEASE BOTH YOU'VE BEEN DEFRAUDED

WITTY AND ELEGANT STYLISH AND GREAT FUN LET GOALKEEPER I WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGED YOU COULD A BIT OF ME IN THAT GO AND LUDICROUS TO THINK OF ME PLAYING AT THAT KIND OF LEVEL IF I HAD BEEN KEEPING GOAL AND SOMEBODY HAD TAKEN THAT KIND OF PENALTY I WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED IT MAY HAVE IT WAS CLEARLY
I WENT DOWN THE MIDDLE HERE BECAUSE WHY DOES SOMEBODY LISTEN TO THE EXPERT AS YOU ARE WHY YOU A GREAT BUDS IT'S POPULATED BASICALLY LEGAL BUT THERE A LOT BUT YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT BUT GAMES ARE PLAYED ACCORDING TO CONVENTION AS WELL AS ACCORDING TO RULES AND IN MANY CASES PLAYING ACCORDING TO CONVENTION IS ALL IMPORTANT PLAYERS THAN PLAYING TO THE RULES
WHEN HE'S CLEARLY THAT IS WRONG FOR THE GOOD BORDERLINE LEGAL BUT IT IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE SO IT'S WHAT PLAYERS ACCEPT ALL BOXES SOMEBODY PLAYER THROUGH HIS FATE IS BUT IF JOE IT'S GOING ON VERY DODGY GROUND AND STEAMBOAT BET USED TO WAVE TO THE CAMERAS DIDN'T DIDN'T THERE WITH THE FAMOUS FIGHT BETWEEN MUHAMMAD ALI AND TERROR

MARIA'S ARISING PERFORMANCE COLOURFUL AND CREATIVE WROUGHT WITH EMOTION
HITTING TRIBUTE FROM THE LACES AND BALLOON FOR AFFORDING THERE IT'S FIVE TO NINE THERE WERE MANY EYEBROWS RAISE YESTERDAY WHEN WE TALK TO EDWARD STOURTON ABOUT HIS PANORAMA PROGRAMME ON JOHN PAUL THE SECOND HE REVEALED A VAST COLLECTION OF LETTERS WHICH PROVE THAT THE POPE WAS TO BECOME A SAINT OF COURSE
IT HAD A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH A MARRIED WOMAN OVER MANY YEARS IN EDWARD WORDS THEY WERE MORE THAN FRIENDS BUT LESS THAN LOVERS BUT INEVITABLY IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT CELIBACY IN THE MODERN CHURCH I'M JOINED BY FATHER ALEXANDER LUCY SMITH WHO'S A CATHOLIC PRIEST HIMSELF CONSORTING WITH THE CATHOLIC HERALD AND CAROLINE FARROW WHO'S A COLUMNIST FOR THE CATHOLIC TO BE AS MOTHER OF FIVE AND THE WIFE OF A CATHOLIC PRIEST AND CAROLINE HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT
MORNING WELL HE WAS ANGLICAN VICAR I CONVERTED TO CATHOLICISM AND ACTUALLY AS THE CHURCH ALLOWS US IN THE PAST YOUR PROVISION LAID DOWN BY JOHN PAUL THE SECOND
HE APPLIED TO ROME FOR A DISPENSATION FROM THE RULE OF CELIBACY AND WAS ORDAINED A CATHOLIC PRIEST RIGHT SO HE IS ALLOWED NOT TO BE CELIBATE THERE IS A DISPENSER EACH OTHER'S YOU SAID THAT'S RIGHT BUT WERE I TO DIE THEN HE WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO GET MARRIED SO HE HAS TO CONSIDER THE ISSUE RIGHT O.K. AND ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT SORT OF RANGE OF YOURSELF FATHER IF I MEAN GIVEN THAT
CELIBACY APPLIES TO EVERYBODY ELSE AS IT WERE ABSOLUTELY OF THE POPE WHAT POLITE I'M VERY HAPPY WITH IT I MEAN I KNOW FATHER FARRELL HE'S A WONDERFUL PRIEST HE IS OF COURSE A BROTHER EXCEPTIONAL PRIEST IN EVERY SENSE MOST CATHOLIC PRIESTS ARE CELIBATE THE ONES OF THE EASTERN CATHOLIC CHURCHES CAN GET MARRIED BUT MOST CATHOLIC PRIESTS ARE CELIBATE AND CELIBACY IS A GREAT TREASURE FOR THE CHURCH AS A CHURCH I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT SO IT IS I THINK THE JARGON IS OR JARGON
A WAY OF PUTTING IT IS THAT IT IS A DISCIPLINE NOT A DOCTRINE OR A OR MOWS THAT RIGHT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE IT COULD CHANGE BUT I DON'T SEE IT CHANGING IN THE NEAR FUTURE ARE IT COULD IT COULD CHANGE ISN'T YOU MEAN BECAUSE IF IT WERE
IF IT WOULD DOCTRINE THEN IT NOT HIS DOCTRINE DOESN'T CHANGE DISCIPLINES CAN CHANGE I MEAN IT'S IT DID THE POPE HAS GIVEN DISPENSATION FOR CAROLINE'S HUSBAND TO BE A PRIEST TO BE MARRIED SO THAT WAS IN FACT A CHANGE BUT IT'S NOT A CHANGE IN DOCTRINE IT'S CHANGE DISCIPLINE DO YOU THINK THE DOCTRINE SHOULD CHANGE COLOUR
NO I DON'T ACTUALLY I I THINK THAT CELIBACY IS ACTUALLY A MUCH HIGHER CALLING AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS A CLERGY SPOUSE I FIND A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS AROUND IT ACTUALLY QUITE INSULTING BECAUSE THEY TREAT THE WIFE AS IF SHE'S SOME KIND OF VESSEL OR OBJECT TO THE IDEA BEING THAT IF A PRIEST IS HAVING SEX WITH HER THEN OBVIOUSLY HE WON'T BE OUT SORT OF ABUSING OTHER PEOPLE WHICH ACTUALLY GIVES
YOU KNOW ALMOST ABUSERS AND AN EXCUSE WHICH WHICH WE MUSTN'T AND ACTUALLY AS ANY MARRIED COUPLE WILL TESTIFY
YOU KNOW MARRIAGE IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT HAVING A RAMBUNCTIOUS SEX LIFE AND IT IS BECAUSE THE CATHOLIC TUH CHURCH TAKES THE VOCATION OF MARRIAGE SO SERIOUSLY THAT IT UNDERSTANDS IT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SERVE TWO MASTERS I NEED YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND HAS FIVE CHILDREN
HE HE RUNS TOO BUSY PARISHES ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HIM AND HE'S NOT THERE'S FREE SO TO MINISTER PERHAPS IN THE WAY THAT A CELIBATE PRIESTS
THAT'S INTERESTING WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS BEEN THE EFFECT OF WHAT WE NOW KNOW ABOUT THE POPE'S FORMER POPES RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MARRIED WOMAN
WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS IN FACT WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN IT'S A CAR HAS BEEN A WELL KNOWN FIGURE IN POLAND AND SHE WAS WELL KNOWN AS AN ASSOCIATE AND A GREAT FRIEND OF THE POPE SHALL WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LETTERS THOUGH HAVE YOU NO I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LETTERS BUT DON'T FORGET THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER LADY CALLED ONE UP HOUSE
IT WAS ALSO THE POPE'S BODY AND WE HAVE SEEN HER BADGERS YES BECAUSE THAT BUDDY AND HER LETTERS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED I MEAN THERE WERE HUGE AMOUNTS OF LET'S BRING HER IN THE PAPER THEY'VE BEEN PUBLISHED HAVE THESE BETS BEEN SITTING AROUND IN THE LIBRARY NOT DREADFULLY SECRET AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN REDACTED IN ANY WAY OF COURSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER LETTERS TO HIM WE'VE BEEN SEEN HIS LETTERS TO HER
BUT DID THE THING ABOUT JOHN PAUL THE SECOND AS HE WAS A VERY WARM HUMAN BEING AND HE HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF FRIENDS AND THESE AND I TELL YOU IT'S ONE DONE AND ABOVE ALL STANISLAV AS CHIEF EDGE THESE THE ONE IS NOW THE ARCHBISHOP OF KRAKOW THESE WERE PART OF HIS CIRCLE AROUND THAT CIRCLE WAS A VERY TIGHT BUNCH OF PEOPLE JUST WANT JUST A VERY QUICK OF YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S TIME TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT SEXUALITY THINKING ABOUT THE Z. GUEVARA SINCE IN SOUTH AMERICA
THE BRAZILIAN CHURCH APPARENTLY SAY NO YOU CAN'T USE CONTRACEPTION IT SEEMS IT SEEMS CLUNKY THERE SO IF IT'S IN HER ALL MY AUNTS ARE GOING TO MAKE A QUICK O.K. WHAT I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY VERY UNFORTUNATE THE WAY THE SEEKER VIRUS HAS HAS BEEN USED TO PROMOTE ABORTION ACTUALLY THE LINK BETWEEN ZUCKER AND MICROCEPHALY
HAS NOT BEEN WELL SADLY WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET INTO THAT I'D LIKE TO BUT WE HAVEN'T UNFORTUNATELY HAD LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN HEAR MORE ABOUT THE LETTERS EDWARD STOURTON IS PRESENTING EXCESS FROM THE LETTERS BETWEEN SAINT JOHN PAUL AND AMATEUR IS AT NINE O'CLOCK ON THE WEDNESDAY MORNING ON RADIO FOUR THAT'S IT FROM US OUR EDITORS WERE JOHN NEIL AND ANDREW BRYCE AND FROM US ALL HAVE A VERY GOOD MORNING
