THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND AS FAR AS THE FRONT PAGES ARE CONCERNED THE SON HAS A VERY STRIKING ONE DEDICATING THE WHOLE OF ITS FRONT PAGE TO URGING ITS READERS TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. BELIEVE IN BRITAIN IS THE HEADLINE WITH BELIEVE SPELT B. E. A. THE YOU WERE ABOUT TO MAKE THE BIGGEST POLITICAL DECISION OF OUR LIVES IT SAYS WE MUST SET OURSELVES FREE FROM DICTATORIAL
A BROTHEL THROUGHOUT A FORTY THREE YEAR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN END IS PROVED INCREASINGLY GREEDY WASTEFUL BULLYING AND BREATHTAKINGLY INCOMPETENT IN A CRISIS NEXT THURSDAY WE CAN CORRECT THIS HUGE AND HISTORIC MISTAKE IT IS OUR LAST CHANCE SAYS THE PAPER BECAUSE BE IN NO DOUBT OUR FUTURE LOOKS FAR BLEAKER IF WE STAY IN WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE ASSOCIATE EDITOR OF THE SUN TREVOR CABINA AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK PRINT GOAL ALL THE PAPERS LEAD WITH THE CAMPAIGN
PRETTY WELL ALL OF THEM TAKE THE SAME PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS THAT THE POLES ARE DECIDING THAT WE'RE GOING TO PULL OUT THE BRECK SIT POLL SAYS THE THE MAIL SAYS THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IS IN MELTDOWN OVER MASS IMMIGRATION IT'S HEADLINE WRECKS IT POLL BOOSTERS MIGRATION FEARS GROW THEY RECKON THERE'S A SEVEN POINT LEAD THERE FOR BRETT
THE TELEGRAPH MUCH THE SAME BOOZE FOR THE LEAVE CAMP AS IT TAKES PULL LEAD THE TIMELESS MUCH THE SAME BRITAIN ON COURSE FOR BREAKS IT OFF THE POLE
OF THE GUARDIAN TO THAT IT DOESN'T LEAD ON THE POLES BUT IT DOES SAY LABOUR IS STEPPING UP THEIR FIGHT FOR EUROPEAN THE EUROPEAN UNION AS ALARM GROWS JEREMY CORBIN GOING TO MOBILISE LABOUR'S ENTIRE SHADOW CABINET AND THE LEAVES HAVE THREE MAJOR TRADE UNIONS TODAY AMID GROWING ALARM AMONG REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS THAT BRITAIN COULD BE ON THE VERGE OF VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THE FACES OF SOME OF THOSE WHO DIED IN THE NIGHT CLUB IN ORLANDO ON SATURDAY NIGHTER ON SOME OF THE FRONT PAGES THE GUARDIAN HAS THE TEXT MESSAGES THAT WAS SENT BY EDDIE JUSTICE FROM WHO WAS HIDING IN ONE OF THE BATHROOMS IN THE CLUB
AND WHO WAS ONE OF THOSE KILLED AT NIGHT SAYING MUMMY I LOVE YOU IN CLUB THEY'RE SHOOTING HE'S COMING I'M GOING TO DIE THE LAST AN INCENTIVE TO THIRTY NINE IN THE MORNING ON THE TIMES FRONT PAGE AMANDA ALVEOLAR WHO WAS TWENTY FIVE AND A TRAINEE NURSE SHE WAS MAKING A VIDEO OF THE SPEED OF THE SCENE IN THE CLUB WHEN THE GUNFIRE BEGAN IN ON THE VIDEO NINE SHORTS CAN BE HEARD CUTTING ACROSS THE MUSIC DROWNING OUT HER VOICE AS THE PAPER
THEN CAME ANOTHER BURST OF GUNFIRE ANOTHER EIGHT SHOTS AND HER VIDEO CUT OUT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE KILLED THAT NIGHT THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX IN IRAQ THE BATTLE FOR FALLUJAH WHICH HE'S BEEN OCCUPIED BY ISIS FORCES FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS IS STILL BEING FOUGHT MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND OF ITS CITIZENS HAD MANAGED TO ESCAPE THROUGH A SAFE CORRIDOR A CORRESPONDENT JOHNSON EXCUSE ME JOHN AND BILL IS IN IRAQ JONATHAN WHAT IS THIS TELL ME WHAT STAGE ARE WE AT NOW
OR PRETTY EARLY STAGES ABOUT THE SURROUNDING IT FLEA JAZZ HAPPENED THERE IS AN OFFENSIVE IN THE SOUTH
TO TRY TO FREE FREE THE CITY FROM A. S. CONTROL THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AS YOU SAY YOU'VE NOW COME THROUGH A CORRIDOR INTO SAFETY WITH HORROR STORIES OF LIFE UNDER A. S. BUT ALSO COMPLAINING ABOUT ARTILLERY FIRE ANT ROCKETS FROM THIS OFFENSIVE TOO BUT FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE SAYING THEY WERE RUNNING OUT OF FOOD PEOPLE TELLING ME THEY WERE LIVING OFF THE SCRAPS OF SCRAPS THAT I S. HAD DESTROYED THEIR WATER SUPPLIES TO CREATE OBSTACLES FOR THE
IRAQI ARMY AS THEY THEY MEANT THIS OFFENSIVE BUT IT IS SLOW PROGRESS BECAUSE EASY SAY THEY'VE BEATEN THEIR ISLAMIC STATE FOR TWO YEARS AND THEY HAVE DEEP DEFENCES LOTS OF TUNNELS LOTS OF I.D. BELTS AND LIFE IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE IRAQI ARMY AND THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO SORT OF MARCH IN THERE WITH A BIT OF INFANTRY AND A FEW TANKS AND ALL THAT
I THINK IT IS FENCE FOR I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT IS WHAT THEY THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN I THINK THEY ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I S.O. HAD THAT TIME TO LAY THEIR DEFENCES AND THAT'D BE THE PROBLEM WITH THESE TUNNELS WHERE THEY CAN MOVE FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WITHOUT BEING DETECTED AND THEY HAVE THESE I.D. BELTS WHICH SLOWS THE ADVANCED UNIT DOZENS OF I.E.D.S FOUND EACH MORNING BY THE IRAQI ARMY AS THEY TRY TO PUSH IT FORWARD BUT JUST ONLY MOVING A MATTER OF YARDS SO IT IS GOING TO BE A
A DIFFICULT FIGHT SOME WESTERN OBSERVERS SAY IT COULD TAKE MONTHS IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME I THINK BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE FIGHTERS AND THE ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY THE ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS IN THE CITY FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND BUT ARE BELIEVED TO BE FOREIGN FIGHTERS IT'S INTERESTING THAT THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS THAT SOME OF THEM ARE FLEEING OUTWITH THE CIVILIAN POPULATION TRYING TO GET THAT UNDETECTED AND THE IRAQI ARMY SAY THEY HAVE
INTERROGATED FIVE HUNDRED MEN WHO THEY BELIEVE ARE MEMBERS OF R. E. S. WHO WERE TRYING TO LEAVE THE CITY AND REMEMBER THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS THAT SHIA MILITIA HAVE STOP SOME OF THE CIVILIANS FLEEING AND I'VE TAKEN THE MEN AWAY AND REPORTS OF ABUSE AND EVEN AN KILLINGS BY THE HANDS OF THE SHIA MILITIA WHICH ARE NOW BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE IRAQI ARMY A GOVERNMENT I SHOULD SAY JONATHAN THANKS
THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX IMMIGRATION HAS LONG BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR BRITISH VOTERS AND THANKS TO THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IT IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE E.U. DEBATE A POPULAR ONE FOR THOSE CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE EFFECT OF E.U. MIGRATION ON THE U.K. FOR A DOCUMENTARY THAT'S ON B. B. C. TWO TONIGHT LOOKING AT WAGES PUBLIC SERVICES LIKE HEALTH AND EDUCATION AND THE BENEFIT SYSTEM IS THE FORMER WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHO CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U.
IS THERE SUCH A THING IN YOUR VIEW AS BENEFIT TOURISM FROM
IF I'M HONEST ABOUT IT I THINK THEY'RE MAYBE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO NAIL DOWN THE FIGURES IN THIS I MEAN I DID SEE SOMEBODY SAY THAT MOST PEOPLE IN THE EASTERN EUROPE DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE BENEFITS WERE SO I'M A LITTLE AMBIVALENT ABOUT THIS ONE BECAUSE HE SOUNDED PRETTY CONVINCED ABOUT IT LAST YEAR WHEN YOU SAID THAT YOU WANTED KNOW THE BENEFIT TOURISM WAS A NUT THAT YOU WANTED TO CRACK YES I THINK FOR THOSE ARE DO COME OVER I'VE NEVER SAID THERE ARE A VAST NUMBER
DO I IF THE QUESTION IS TOO HIGH I THINK THAT IT IS A HUGE DRIVER FOR PEOPLE COMING OVER HERE THE ANSWER'S CATEGORICALLY NOT IF I DO YOU LIKE RINGS ARE LESS LIKELY THAN U.K. NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT HOUSING BENEFIT I WHAT IT'S ABOUT THEN WELL I DON'T THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE
ONE OF THE AREAS OF WITH THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF E.U. MIGRANTS ANYWHERE IN THE U.K. IS PETERBOROUGH IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE AND I WENT THERE TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON THE N.H.S. AND ALSO ON EDUCATION HERE'S WHAT ONE LOCAL G.P. DOCTOR EMMA TIFFIN TOLD ME ABOUT HER SURGERY'S EXPERIENCE IF YOU DO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER RELATIVE TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND HOUSES ARE MULTIPLE
SEVERAL FAMILIES IN ONE HOUSE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES A FAMILY IN ONE
AS I SAY THE ACTUAL QUALITY OF THE HOUSING IS OFTEN PAUSE THERE ARE HOUSES ROUND HERE THAT ARE VERY DAMP THAT IN ITSELF CAUSES THE HIGH RISK OF THINGS LIKE THE SPIRITUAL INFECTION
WE DO FIND WHOLE FAMILIES AND HOUSEHOLDS AT PRESENT WITH
INCLUDING THE CHILDREN ABSOLUTELY SO AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANY FIGURES FOR A LOCAL HOSPITAL
NO PARTICULARLY FOR A SPIRITUAL AFFECTION AND IN THE YOUNGER GROUP DO YOU THEY'RE FULL SEE MIGRATION
AN ADDED PRESSURE ON THE SERVICE YOU CAN OFFER AS A LOCAL
DEFINITELY AND I THINK THE NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THE DISTANCE FOR ME IS THIS WORKING IN PETERBOROUGH IS IS UNBELIEVABLE ACTUALLY SO I THINK LANGUAGE THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE AND HEALTH BELIEFS AND BEHAVIOUR AND ACTUALLY THE HIGH
THE PREVALENCE OF ILLNESSES RELATED TO POVERTY AND DIFFICULT HOUSING CONDITIONS WOULD BE
THREE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUE
DOCTOR EMMA TIFFIN WHO WORKS IN PETERBOROUGH AN AREA OF HIGH MIGRATION THE A NATIONAL PICTURE IN TERMS OF EUROPEAN MIGRANTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE HEALTH SERVICE IS MIXED BRITAIN AND EUROPE THE IMMIGRATION QUESTION IS ON B. B. C. TWO AT NINE O'CLOCK TONIGHT
IT IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX NINE DAYS TO GO BEFORE IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS AND WE ALL VOTE OUT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS PREPARING FOR THAT OR PERHAPS DOMINIC PANICKING IT'S THE WORD BECAUSE THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF THAT JOHN YES ABSOLUTELY WILL BECOME BASES ARE CERTAINLY STARTING TO POSITION THEMSELVES IT WOULD BE A REFERENDUM
CURRENCY MARKETS ARE WITH THE BIG ACTION IS COMPANIES AND TRADERS ARE GETTING READY TO MAKE MONEY FROM VOLATILITY IN STIRLING REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE POLE
I ASKED MIKE AMY WHO'S A MANAGING DIRECTOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER WHY DO WE CONSIDERED TO BE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BON MANAGER HOW PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS LIKE HIM IF YOU DEVOTE SOME PARTS OF THE U.K. MARKETS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO LOCAL BRICKS AT RISK THAN OTHERS THE PRIMARY MARKET THE PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED ON AND WE WE LOOK TO THE CURRENCY MARKET OTHER PARTS OF THE MARKETS OF THE EQUITY MARKET FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN AS HE'S GOT
INFLUENCES BOTH WAYS THE UNCERTAINTY AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE FACT A LOT OF EARNINGS ARE MADE OVERSEAS WHICH IS ACTUALLY POSITIVE FOR FOR STERLING EQUITY HOLDER SLIPPED HIM UP HE'S BEEN LESS VOLATILE SO FAR AND THEN THE OTHER EVERYONE TURNS TO LOOK AT IS IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF INTEREST RATE CUTS BECAUSE INTERACTS CUTS IN OUR VIEW REFLECTS WORKS AT RISK
THE REFERENDUM IS NOT THE ONLY BIG EVENT MOVING THE MARKET'S LOW INTEREST RATES AND NOW THIS STRANGE PHENOMENON OF LOW OF NEGATIVE BOND YIELDS A HANGOVER INVESTORS WITH SOME FEARING THERE A SIGNAL OF A BIG CRASH TO COME THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY OUT THEIR BRICKS IT OBVIOUSLY IS THE ONE IN THERE IN THE SHORTEST TURN THERE'S UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT HAPPENS IN CHINA SOME COMMENTS MOST RECENT BY A MYTH ABOUT THE ABOUT THE ISSUES THERE WITH WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF DEBT SO THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE SOME STORM CLOUDS OUT THERE
TO DISCUSS THIS IN THE REST OF THE MARKET'S NEWS I'M JOINED BY JESSICA GROUND FUND MANAGER AT SCHROEDER'S JUSQU'A WE TOOK THERE TO MIKE ABOUT CURRENCY MARKETS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR SPECIALIST FIELD EQUITY MARKETS WELL WHAT I'VE NOTICED THERE'S BEEN A BUILD UP OF TENSION RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT A REFERENDUM WAS COMING AND CERTAINLY THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES WE'VE SPOKEN TO HAVE BEEN REASONABLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT INVESTING DOMESTICALLY
AND IN THE EQUITY MARKETS YOU SEEM VERY DOMESTICALLY FOCUS SECTOR IS COMING UNDER PRESSURE SO THAT'S REAL ESTATE HOUSE BUILDERS WITH A BUILD UP OF INSURGENCY THOSE AREAS THAT ARE VIEWED AS IS PRETTY DEFENSIVE UTILITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE AREN'T AFFECTED I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO REALISE
WE TALK ABOUT THE U. K. EQUITY MARKET BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY INTERNATIONALS THOSE FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL WILL HELP BUT MARKET'S GENERALLY DON'T LIKE UNCERTAINTY AND OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS IT SEEMS LIKE THE UNCERTAINTIES INCREASED SO IT I THINK THE EXPRESSION IT FEELS QUITE TENSE AND I FIND IT FASCINATING WE'VE GOT THE GREAT PRIVILEGE TALKING TO A NUMBER OF BOARD DIRECTORS AND COMPANIES AND CERTAINLY THE ONES I'VE SPOKEN TO IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HAVE UPPED THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIR SCENARIO PLANNING IN THE BOARDROOM AS WELL
IT'S THIS IDEA OF A GOOD CITY BEING A TENSE PLACE AT THE MOMENT COULD HAVE THE REFERENDUM REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU THINK THE OUTCOME MIGHT BE IT JUST STOPS PEOPLE DOING THINGS DOESN'T IT I THINK SO YOU KNOW AT THAT IT HAS IT'S DEFINITELY BEEN A REASON CITED BY ANOTHER NUMBER OF COMPANIES THEY PUT INVESTMENT OR EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS ON ON HOLD BUT SIMILARLY WE HAVE SOME CLIENTS WHO MAYBE ARE LOOKING TO INCREASE HER WRISTS IN THERE PUT PORTFOLIOS BETTER RELUCTANT TO INVEST MORE IN IN THE U.K. EQUITY MARKETS
AHEAD OF AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM AND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE RISK BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE WIDER GLOBAL BACKDROP OF JUST GENERALLY SLIT SLOWER GROWTH SO I THINK ONCE YOU KNOW ONCE WE KNOW THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM AND WE STILL HAVE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES WE TALKED ABOUT CHINA WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE RATES DON'T GO AWAY
LOW LOW RATES ARE ESTRANGED THING AREN'T THEY THEY ARE NEGATIVE BON YIELDS WOULDN'T YOU EXPECT THE EQUITY MARCUS TO BE SOARING AS PEOPLE GO AND LOOK FOR HIM ARE GOING TO PAY THEM SOME KIND OF RETURN WELL I THINK WHAT WE'VE ENTERED ISN'T IT A BIT IT'S A BIT OF A FUNNY CIRCLE AS YOU WRITE A LOT A LOT OF LOW RATES IS DELIBERATELY DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TAKE MORE RISK TO INVEST MORE AND EQUITY MARKETS WOULD BE A KEY PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO ALLOCATE THEIR MONEY BUT ACTUALLY PUT PART OF THE PROMISE OF RATES HAVE BEEN THERE FOR LONGER BECAUSE
GROWTH HAS BEEN LOWER AND IT'S BEEN MUCH HARDER FOR IT FOR COMPANIES TO GET EARNINGS GROWTH AND TOP LINE GROWTH SO THEN THAT IN TURN MAKES PEOPLE PEOPLE MORE CAUTIOUS AND I THINK PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS THAT GROWTH WHO'D RETURN THAT KEEPS GETTING PUSHED FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT AND SENSE AND CERTAINLY A LOT OF CENTRAL BANKS OUR CONTINUE TO TALK QUITE QUITE CAUTIOUSLY SO YES YOU'VE GOT POLICY PUSHING YOU TOWARDS RISK
ASSETS BUT SOME OF THE REASONS WHY IT BY THAT POLICY'S DOING THAT MAKES YOU A BIT UNCERTAIN THANK YOU MOST JESSICA JESSICA GROUND THE FUND MANAGER AT SCHROEDER'S WE TURN NOW TO THE VIDEO GAMING INDUSTRY WHICH BELIEVE IT OR NOT IS BIGGER THAN HOLLYWOOD AND ALL THE BIG WIGS ARE IN LOS ANGELES SHOWING OFF THE LATEST PRODUCTS AT THE E. THREE CONFERENCE JOINING US LIVE FROM LOS ANGELES AS DAVE LEAVE THE B.B.C.'S NORTH AMERICA TECHNOLOGY REPORTER DAVE THE HOT THING THIS YEAR REALLY HAS BEEN VIRTUAL REALITY THERE'S BEEN SOME BIG LAUNCHES I HEAR
YES THEY HAVE AND TWO VERY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES I GUESS IS TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS THREE THIS MORNING WHICH IS COMING OUT ON MONDAY EVENING HERE THIS MORNING IN LOS ANGELES MICROSOFT CAME OUT AND HAD THEIR PRESS CONFERENCE TELLING US ALL ABOUT THEIR PLANS OF VIRTUAL REALITY AND THERE
CORE THING THEY'RE BIG ANNOUNCEMENT IS THAT NEXT YEAR THEY'RE GOING TO BRING OUT A NEW CONSOLE ONE THAT'S VERY VERY POWERFUL PROBABLY QUITE EXPENSIVE THERE'S GONNA BE GOOD ENOUGH POWERFUL ENOUGH TO HANDLE THESE VIRTUAL REALITY GAMES BECAUSE THEY'RE MUCH MORE DEMANDING THAN GAMES WE'VE SEEN UP TO THIS POINT COS YOU CAN MOVE AROUND FREELY AND LOOK WHEREVER YOU WANT NOW SONY'S PRESS CONFERENCE THAT COMES LATER IN THE DAY
TYPICALLY SPEAKING THIS COULD BE A BIT ROWDIER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OUT ENJOYING THE DAY THEY MIGHT HAVE A FEW PEERS BY THEN THEY CAN BE KIND OF MORE ENERGETIC AND SAMI CERTAINLY OFTEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND THEY CAME OUT AND THEY SAID WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE THINK OUR PLAYSTATION IS POWERFUL ENOUGH ALREADY SO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A STRAIGHT AWAY YOU WOULDN'T GET THAT IN OCTOBER THIS YEAR RATHER THAN EXPORTS CAME AS THATAWAY RIGHT UNTIL NEXT YEAR SO TWO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES
GETTING IN THERE FIRST THAT'S A RISK BECAUSE IT IS IF IT DOESN'T LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THEM XBOX THEY'RE TAKING A LONG GAME THAT'S A RISK AS WELL OF COURSE BECAUSE THEY COULD BE TOO LATE THEY HAVE YOU TALKED ABOUT MICROSOFT THE OTHER THING THAT WAS HAPPENING AWAY FROM ME THREE YESTERDAY WAS A MICROSOFT ANNOUNCE US BIGGEST TAKEOVER DEAL BUYING LINKED HIM FOR TWENTY SIX POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WHAT THIS AT SEA IN THIS IN THIS SOCIAL NETWORK FOR EXECUTIVES
I COULD SAY THAT WAS A SURPRISE EVEN TO THE MARKERS OF PIA PEOPLE AT THE XBOX FERMENT SO THAT WOULD CERTAINLY SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH LINKED IN MIKE'S ARTHUR ESSENTIALLY BUYING OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE BUYING A PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL NETWORK AND THE THOUGHT HERE WE IMAGINE IS GOING TO INTEGRATE THAT INTO WHAT THEY OFFER A READING SO OBVIOUSLY MANY PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH WORD X.L. THEY WANT TO MAKE A SWEETS I GUESS THIS INDISPENSABLE TO BUSINESS
USES SAME EVERYTHING YOU DO WHETHER IT'S MEETING NEW PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT TRYING TO GET A NEW JOB OR JUST DOING GENERAL DATES THEY WORK THEY WANT YOU TO DO THAT WITH MARCUS OFF AND THAT'S WHY THEY'VE GONE OUT AND BOUGHT LINKED IN WITH THAT'S WORTH TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS OR NOT REMAINS TO BE SEEN BUT CERTAINLY A VERY VERY EYE CATCHING ACQUISITION FROM MICROSOFT DAVE THANK YOU MUCH DAVE LEAVE THE B.B.C.'S NORTH AMERICA TECHNOLOGY REPORT WILL YOU THREE IS ALL ABOUT NEW GAMES
BUT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE PROMOTING THEM THINK THEY COULD BE ACTUALLY BIG SPECTATOR SPORTS EVENTUALLY RIBEAN TRADITIONAL GAMES LIKE FOOTBALL I THOUGHT I SHOULD PROBABLY TRY AND GET SOME HANDS ON EXPERIENCE IN THE RESULTS RATHER PREDICTABLY WITH EMBARRASSING
THE LAST TIME I PLAYED A VIDEO GAME WAS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO AND VERY SLOW MOVING PIXILATED ALIENS CAME DOWN THE SCREEN TOWARDS ME AT ALL CHANGED
YOU SEE THAT POINT THERE ABOUT YOU BUT I NEED TO YOUR ROOM ACTUALLY IT'S CHANGE FOR SOMETHING SO YOU LOOK A LOT LIKE I DID AGAIN THAT DID NOT TAKE
I'D LIKE TO SAY I'M ENJOYING THIS BUT ACTUALLY IT'S TORTURE I PREFERRED IT WHEN THEY'RE ALIENS WERE VERY SLOW MOVEMENT BEING KILLED LIKE THIS MAY BE PAINFUL BUT IT'S A START OF THE JOURNEY TO HOPEFULLY BECOMING AN ATHLETE AND MAYBE EVEN MONDAY COMPETING
OVER THE WEEKEND PROFESSIONAL TEAMS FROM ACROSS THE WORLD GATHERED IN LOS ANGELES
TO COMPETE IN AN EVENT ORGANISED BY ACTOR VISION AN AMERICAN COMPANY BUT HAS A BIG PRESENCE IN LONDON AND IN DUNDEE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TURNED UP TO WATCH THE ACTION COMPLETE WITH GIANT DISPLAY SCREENS AND OF COURSE O.K.
OVER THE TOP COMMENTATORS WITH THEM BUT IT'S JUST ONE OF INK IN WHAT IS NOW A YEAR LONG LEAGUE ACTIVATION PUTS ON THE EVENTS TO HELP SELL THE GAME THEY PLAY CALL OF DUTY BUT IT WON'T BE LONG KES'S ACTIVATIONS MIKE'S IPSO BEFORE THE LIVE ACTION RIVALS THE SALES OF THE GAME ITSELF IT'S IN A TRANSITION PERIOD
WHEN HIS PREMIER MARKETING EFFORT TO DRIVE THE CORE
BUSINESS BUT OUR GAME TO BUSINESS AND THAT'S TRUE FOR THE WHOLE INDUSTRY IN MOVING TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE SPORTS MEDIA BUSINESS IN IT REALLY THAT IS A WRONG ONE OBJECTIVE AS THE MEDIAN ORATOR VISION IS TO HELP BUILD E. SPORT INTO A SUSTAINABLE PROFITABLE BUSINESS
IN CASE YOU THINK THIS IS SOME KIND OF FRINGE ACTIVITY CONSIDERED THIS THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE AS HOST CITY SPORTS EVENTS AND CINEMAS HAVE BECOME DEDICATING SOMEBODY SCREENS TO SHOW TOURNAMENTS LIKE THE ONE IN LOS ANGELES SOME PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS MIGHT THINK THIS AND THIS IS REALLY JUST A NICHE OCCUPATION
A NICHE SPORT BECAUSE I'M NEVER GOING TO IMAGINE TEAMS OF FOUR MAIN RUNAROUND KILL EACH OTHER KEN REALLY GO OUT AND BE AS BIG AS SOMETHING LIKE AMERICAN FOOTBALL OR SOCCER
YEAH LOOK I THINK THAT THE TOTAL GLOBAL AUDIENCES PROJECTED TO PAST THE AMERICAN FOOTBALL THE N.F.L. AUDIENCE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS I THINK HE JUST POINTS TO THE FACT THAT
IF THERE IS THAT MANY PEOPLE WATCHING A SPORT BEING BROADCAST REGARDLESS OF THE DISTRIBUTION I THINK THEN I THINK THERE'S ABSOLUTELY THE POTENTIAL FOR IT TO BE BIGGER AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF THIS IS WE'RE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF A GENERATIONAL DIVIDE IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE CONSUME VIDEO CONTENT WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE LARGELY ISSUING
TRADITIONAL TELEVISION IN MOVING TO AN OLDER GENERATIONS OF SORT OF THINKS OF THEIR SAYS SO FOR WINE IT'S HARD TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND IT WHERE IT'S REALLY NEARLY HAVE A NATURAL TO TO YOUNG PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE A DROP YOU'VE GOT TO
IT ALL POINTS TO A FUTURE WITH VIRTUAL SPORTS WILL CHALLENGE REAL ONES FOR VIEWERS EYEBALLS AND FANS ARE FICTIONS MADE THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE SAID IT HAD RECEIVED A REQUEST FROM SOUTH KOREA IF IT P. SPORTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE GAME
SO NEXT TIME YOUR TEAM TO TAKE CASTIGATING A TEENAGER FOR SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON HIS OR HER PLAYSTATION JUST BITE YOUR LEG THEY MIGHT BE TRAINING TO BE THE NEXT
REMEMBER YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST VIDEO GAMES ARE COMING TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES HE'S ONLY BEEN WITH US FOR TWO DAYS AND ALREADY HE'S MAKING A FOOL OF NO I'M NOT MAKING A VERY GOOD NICE PIECE LENGTH ON IT TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX AND A BIT MORE SUPPORTIVE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHRIS

THEY DON'T LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS SAID IT WILL MAINTAIN FUNDING TO UNIVERSITIES REGIONS AREN'T ORGANISATIONS THAT CURRENTLY RECEIVE MONEY FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IF BRITAIN CHOOSES TO WITHDRAW THE ROOMY INSIDE SAYS IT'S A PLEDGE THAT VOTE LEAVE US NOT IN A POSITION TO IMPLEMENT AND HAS ACCUSED THEM OF FANTASY ECONOMICS
THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN WERE WORN TODAY THAT HIS PARTY IS IN A RACE AGAINST TIME TO GET ITS SUPPORTERS TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE E.U. YOU'LL SAY THERE'S A BRECHT SET WILL THREATEN PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAID THAT IT'S BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP WHICH PUT PUBLIC SERVICES UNDER PRESSURE FROM IMMIGRATION
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ENGLISH F.A. GREG DYKE SAID HE HAS SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY AHEAD OF ENGLAND'S NEXT GAME AT EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN HE'S WRITTEN TO UEFA AS BOTH ENGLISH AND RUSSIAN SUPPORTERS ARE LIKELY TO GATHER IN LILLE AHEAD OF THEIR NEXT GAMES WITH BOTH TEAMS FACING EXPULSION FROM THE TOURNAMENT IF THERE'S MORE TROUBLE
A CAUGHT IN LOS ANGELES IS DUE TO HEAR CLAIMS THAT THE INTRO TO THE CLASSIC TRACK STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN BY THE BRITISH BAND LED ZEPPELIN WAS COPIED FROM ANOTHER SONG THE COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT TRIAL WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE FAMOUS RIFT WAS LIFTED FROM AN INSTRUMENTAL BY THE U.S. BAND SPIRIT
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE WERE VISUALS IN MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD LAST NIGHT IN MEMORY OF THOSE WHO DIED IN THE ORLANDO NIGHTCLUB ATTACK AND THERE ARE NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE MAN RESPONSIBLE ARE NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOBEL IS IN ORLANDO I THINK IT BECOMES A MUCH MORE COMPLEX PICTURE THAN WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT WHEN THE FIRST REPORTS EMERGED THAT HE HAD RUNG THE POLICE AND SAID I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I'M INSPIRED BY ISLAMIC STATE
THEN IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ALMOST A CARBON COPY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN BERNARDINO WITH TWO VERY IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN PEOPLE ARE HUSBAND AND WIFE HARE CARRIED OUT THAT ATTACK THIS LOOKS MUCH MUCH MORE NUANCED THAN THAT IF HE'S EMERGED LAST NIGHT THAT HE WAS A REGULAR VISITOR OF THE NIGHTCLUB THAT HE WENT TO THAT HE WAS A GAY DATING WEBSITE SO THIS MUSLIM MAN WHO WAS MARRIED WITH A THREE YEAR OLD CHILD
CLEARLY HAD SOME ISSUES GOING ON IN HIS LIFE WE'VE HEARD FROM AN EX WIFE THAT HE WAS BIPOLAR THAT HE HAD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT HE HAD VIOLENT MOOD SWINGS I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD SURVIVED THE ATTACK AND I ASKED HIM
CAN YOU MAKE SENSE OF ANY OF THIS IN HE PAUSED AND CARVE YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING ABOUT HE WOULD ANSWER THE BIG PICTURE QUESTION ABOUT HOMER PHOBIA AND HE SAID I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE WHO LIVED SO FAR AWAY FROM THIS PARTICULAR NIGHTCLUB
WOULD CHOOSE TO ATTACK IT IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST NIGHTCLUB IN THE AREA IT'S NOT THE MOST FAMOUS WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE THIS ONE AS YOUR TARGET WELL MAYBE WE HAVE AN ANSWER BUT IT WAS FAR AWAY ENOUGH FROM WHERE HE LIVED AND HE WAS ABLE TO GO THERE IN SOME SAFETY HOW THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SEEING IT
THEY HAVE SEEN IT IN PRETTY BLACK AND WHITE TERMS THERE ARE SOME OF THE NEW WAS DONALD TRUMP HAS COME OUT AND SAID WE NEED TO STOP IMMIGRATION FROM COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS A KNOWN LINK TO TERRORISM AND IT WAS A SOUND BUT THAT WILL PROBABLY APPEAL TO AN AWFUL LOT OF AMERICANS
BUT INEVITABLY THE MORE YOU INTERROGATE WHAT THAT MEANS WHICH COUNTRIES WOULD YOU SAY FRANCE WOULD YOU SAY BELGIUM WAVE HAD HOME GROWN TERRORISTS WOULD YOU SAY SO NO ONE FROM FRANCE AND BELGIUM CAN COME TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OH DOES IT MEAN COMING FROM CERTAIN CULTURES OF THE MIDDLE EAST IS IT MEAN SYRIA
SO THE QUESTION IS LEFT OPEN ABOUT THE DETAIL OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS PROPOSING BUT UNDOUBTEDLY HE TAPS INTO A WIDER CONCERN ABOUT WHO IS COMING INTO AMERICA WHAT ARE THEIR MOTIVES ARE COMING HERE
AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON SAYING THIS IS A REASON WHY WE NEED TIGHTER BACKGROUND CHECKS ON PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING WEAPONS HOW CAN IT BE CONCEIVABLE THAT SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE ON A TERRORISM WATCH LIST BY THE F.B.I. IS ABLE TO GO INTO A GUN SHOP
AND ARM THEMSELVES WITH THE MOST POWERFUL AND LETHAL ASSAULT RIFLE THERE IS TOM SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN OR NINE DAYS TO GO AND THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN GETS A BOOST FROM THE SOME THIS MORNING THAT'S FRONT PAGE CALLS ON ITS READERS TO VOTE LEVI ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR
IS NORMAN SMITH NO GREAT SURPRISE NORMAN BUT STILL NO SIGNIFICANT BUT AS YOU SAY ANYONE WHO'S READ THE SUN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WEEKS MONTHS YEARS DECADES ACTUALLY WILL KNOW THE SUN HAS BEEN A FAIRLY CONSTANT FLYER OF ALL THINGS BRUSSELS AND Y. YOU TODAY IN TYPICALLY TRENCHANT IT COMES OUT ON ITS FRONT PAGE URGING PEOPLE TO VOTE LEAVES SAYING AND I QUOTE WE MUST SET OURSELVES FREE FROM DICTATORIAL BRUSSELS THROUGHOUT A FORTY THREE MEMBERSHIP FOR FORTY THREE YEAR MEMBERSHIP
IT HAS PROVED INCREASINGLY GREEDY WASTEFUL BULLYING AND BREATHTAKINGLY INCOMPETENT SIGNIFICANT THOUGH BECAUSE YES IT IS BRITAIN'S LARGEST SELLING NEWSPAPER BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT APPEALS TO PREDOMINANTLY BLUE COLLAR LESS AFFLUENT WORKERS PRECISELY THE GROUP THAT THE BREAKS HAD CAMPAIGN HAD BEEN TRYING TO REACH OUT TO SO THEY'RE NOT PORTRAYED
ANGRY COLONELS IN THE SHIRES OR WHATEVER THE OTHER THING I THINK IS SIGNIFICANT IS IT UNDERLINES THE PROFOUND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS REFERENDUM AND THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM BECAUSE IN THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM MY CAMERA MISTER OSBORNE WERE BUOYED BY THE OVERWHELMING BACKING OF WHAT WAS FLEET STREET AND INDEED BY THE SCOTTISH NEWSPAPERS EVEN THE SCOTTISH SUN WHICH SHOULD PALLID UP TO ALEX SALMOND AT THE END OF THE DAY SAT ON THE FENCE IN THIS REFERENDUM LARGE CHUNKS OF FLEET STREET ARE NOISILY AND AGGRESSIVELY IN FAVOUR
OF LEAVING THE E.U. SO IF THE REMAIN CAMP IS GETTING A BATTERING AND IT IS AT THE MOMENT IT SEEMS WHAT CAN IT DO WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT OUGHT TO BE DOING RIGHT NOW TO REGAIN A BIT OF GRASS
WELL THERE ARE TWO STRATEGIES ONE IS SORT OF K.B. OH KEEP BUGGERING ON WHICH IS THE SORT OF KEEP
HAMMERING HOME THE MESSAGE ON THE ECONOMY WHICH IS WHAT I THINK YOU WILL HEAR FROM MY CAMERA IN THE LATTER PARTS OF THIS CAMPAIGN AND THE SECOND STRATEGY AS A SORT OF RESCUE LABOUR'S STRATEGY AND WE GET MORE OFF THE LABOUR RELAUNCH REVAMP FIGHT BACK CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL TODAY WITH JEREMY CORBIN PLAYING WHAT I GUESS IS SORT OF YOU KNOW
THE CORE VOTE CARD UNDERLINING WHAT MISTER CORBIN AND LABOUR AND THE TRADE UNIONS BELIEVE IS THE THREAT TO THE N.H.S. FROM LEAVING THE E.U. BECAUSE THEY PSYCHED RESEARCH BY THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES WHICH SAYS I'LL BE A FORTY BILLION HIT TO PUBLIC FINANCES THAT THEY SAY WILL MEAN A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT CUT IN THE N.H.S. BUDGET AND THEY ALSO HAVE A LETTER FROM FORMER BOSSES OF THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE ROYAL COLLEGES
SAYING LOOK MIGRANTS ARE NOT A BURDEN ON THE N.H.S. THEY PROP IT UP TEN PERCENT OF DOCTORS COME FROM THE E. U. FIVE PER CENT OF NURSES COME FROM THE U. AND THE HOPE IS THAT WILL RESONATE WITH LABOUR VOTERS ALL THE OTHER WE'VE GOT LEAD TODAY SAYING WHATEVER MONEY YOU GET FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND YOUR CONTINUED TO GET IT IF YOU'RE BOOK LEAVE YES A MESSAGE OF REASSURANCE TO FARMERS UNIVERSITIES LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS WHO GET REGIONAL FUNDS FROM THE E.U. THAT IT WILL BE CARRY ON FUNDING THE CASH
WILL STILL COME IT'S NOT GOING TO BE CUT INDEED THEY SEEM TO BE IMPLY THERE WILL BE MORE CASH BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE STRIPPED OUT THE THE BRUSSELS BUREAUCRACY ELEMENT OF THIS AND THEY ARGUE THAT ACTUALLY FUNDING FOR THINGS LIKE FARMING IS GRADUALLY BEING PARED BACK IN BRUSSELS THAT TOO WILL BE A FIRST SO A MESSAGE OF REASSURANCE THAT THE MONEY WILL BE THERE AND IT WILL BE BETTER SPENT AND IN ALL PROBABILITY THERE WILL BE MORE MONEY QUICK WORD ABOUT THE POLES
WELL I MEAN ONE ALWAYS SAYS THAT A SORT OF HELIUM BALLOON OF CAVEATS AND CAUTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO POLES YOU LOOK AT THE LAST ELECTION AND WE GOT A SPECTACULARLY ARE WRONG POLES MOVE ABOUT IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND THE POLLS THIS TIME IT'S EVEN HARDER BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT NO BASELINE WE HAVEN'T BEEN HERE BEFORE BUT
THIS MORNING THE PICTURE THEY PAINT PAINT FRANKLY IS OF GROWING MOMENTUM BEHIND THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WE HAVE A POLE BY YOU GOVERN THE TIMES WHICH PUTS LEAVE ON FORTY SIX PER CENT REMAIN ON THIRTY NINE'S HAS A SEVEN POINT GAP WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT IS THE GAP IS GROWING LEAVE UP BY THREE REMAIN DOWN BY THREE AND THE SAME STORY IN THE GUARDIAN FOR I.C.M. LEAVE ON FIFTY THREE PER CENT REMAIN ON FORTY SEVEN PER CENT AGAIN LEAVE UP ONE REMAINED
DOWN ONE AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IS REFLECTED NOT SEEM TO BE AN INCREASINGLY DARK MOOD SORT OF GALLOWS HUMOUR AMONG SOME MEMBERS OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN NO WANT THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY TO SEVEN B.B.C. NEWS HAS DISCOVERED THAT SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RAN UP A LEGAL BILL OF MORE THAN TWO MILLION POUNDS REPRESENTING ITS FORMER CHIEF CONSTABLE DURING THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST VICTIMS' FAMILIES HAVE CRITICISED DAVID CROMPTON'S CONDUCT SAYING THAT HE INSTRUCTED HIS LEGAL TEAM TO POOR BLAME ONTO THE LIVERPOOL FANS DAVID RHODES FROM B. B. C. LOOK NORTH JOINS US NOW FROM LEEDS AND THIS WAS UNCOVERED DAVID BY LOOKING AT THE FORCES PUBLIC SPENDING BLOB WHAT EXACTLY DID THE ENTRIES SHOW IN TERMS OF HOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT
FOR CLARITY EVERY TIME A POLICE FORCE SPENDS MORE FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS IN A TRANSACTION THAT HAS TO BE LOGGED AND PUBLISH WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THOSE DATA ENTRIES AND EFFECTIVELY ADDED UP ALL THE ONES THAT RELATE TO SPENDING ON DAVID CROMPTON WHAT THEY SHOW IS THEY SHOW PAYMENTS TO HIS LEGAL TEAM FOR EXAMPLE HIS QUEEN'S COUNSEL FIONA BARTON DURING THE COURSE OF THE INQUEST
WAS PAID A MILLION POUNDS WHEN WE PUT THE FIGURES FOR THE OFFICE OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSION AND THEY TOLD US THAT THE OVERALL FIGURE OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION POUNDS WAS ACCURATE AT THE PAYMENTS IN THE LOG REPRESENT PAYMENTS PAID FOR THE LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF DAVID CROMPTON DURING THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST WHAT HAVE THE FAMILIES HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT THE HILLSBOROUGH FAMILIES THEY SAY THAT THIS AND THE LINES IN THEIR VIEW HOW POLICE OFFICERS DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE LEGAL COSTS THAT PEOPLE IN DAY TO DAY LIFE DO YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE MONEY SPECIFICALLY SPENT THEM DAILY CROMPTON
AT THE END OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST HE WAS SUSPENDED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF THE JURY GIVING ITS VERDICTS THE POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSION OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE IS CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF UNDERTAKING A DISMISSAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST MISTER CROMPTON WHO SAID HE WOULD RETIRE IN NOVEMBER THIS YEAR ANYWAY AFTER THE HILLSBOROUGH INDEPENDENT PANEL REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE DAY THE CROMPTON SET AT THE TIME GRAVE ERRORS WERE MADE BY THE POLICE DURING THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER AND HE APOLOGISE PROFOUNDLY
NOW THE FAMILY'S TWENTY AT LEAST TWENTY FAMILIES HAVE LODGED A COMPLAINT WITH THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION THAT MISTER CROMPTON'S CONDUCT LENGTHENED THE WHOLE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST PROCESS AND THEY CLAIM HE INSTRUCTED HIS LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES TO POOR BLAME ON TO THE LIVERPOOL FANS MARGARET OSPITAL LOST PERSON IN THE DISASTER SHE SAYS THE MONEY SPENT ON DAVID CROMPTON UNDERLINES IN HER OPINION HOW UNFAIR THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FOR THEIR FAMILIES IT'S A DISGRACE REALLY ISN'T IT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE MONEY
THAT HAS BEEN SPENT AT THE POLICE
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE DIDN'T GET ANY HELP BUT THESE LAST THIS LAST TWO YEARS
I THINK TO PAY OVER TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION
THE DAVID COMPTON IT'S A DISGRACE
ONE OF THE FORCE HAD TO SAY SINCE THESE FIGURES HAVE EMERGED ERSTWHILE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HAVE SAID NOTHING ACTUALLY THEY'VE DIRECTED ALL OF OUR ENQUIRIES TO THE OFFICE OF THE POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONERS ALAN BUILDINGS AS THEY SAY THIS IS A FINANCIAL MATTER THAT FALLS UNDER THE REMIT OF THE P.C.C. THE POINT MISTER BILLINGS MAKES IS THAT THE INQUEST PROCESS DEFY THE MISTER CROMPTON WAS ENTITLED TO THIS MONEY HE SAYS THE INITIAL DECISIONS REGARDING MISTER CROMPTON'S LEGAL TEAM WERE TAKEN BY SEAN RIGHT THE FORMER P. C. C. WHO RESIGNED IN LIGHT OF THE ROTHERHAM CHILD SEX ABUSE SCANDAL
MY BILLING SAYS HE WANTED TO REDUCE THE OVERALL LEGAL COSTS INVOLVED WITH THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST BUT HE WAS TOLD THAT HE BE CHANGED LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF DAVID CROMPTON IT COULD JEOPARDISE PROCEEDINGS AND END UP COSTING MORE MONEY OVERALL THOUGH MISTER BILLINGS HAS TOLD THE B.B.C. THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION POUNDS AND COVERED IN THESE POLICE LOGS COMBINED WITH THE OVERALL COST OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST MEANS AN ENORMOUS BURDEN HAS BEEN PLACED ON THE PUBLIC PURSE
THAT'S ONLY ONE PART OF THE FUNDING AND ALTOGETHER I THINK IT'S WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY IF YOU LIKE A PUBLIC MONEY I JUST FEEL THAT IT'S SUCH A PITY THAT WE HAD THE HIP WE HAD TO HAVE THE INQUESTS WE'D ALREADY HAVE THE THE HILLSBOROUGH INDEPENDENT PANEL AND I THINK IT'S JUST SUCH A SHAME THAT THE INQUESTS WERE DRAWN UP SUCH A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND THEREFORE ALL THAT MONEY WHAT A GREAT DEAL OF THAT MAKE COULD PROBABLY BITS
DAVID RHODES FROM B.B.C. LOOK NORTH THANK YOU QUOTED THE SEVEN A QUICK LOOK AT THE PAPERS LOADS OF COVERAGE NORMAN SMITH WAS TALKING ABOUT AT THE MOMENT OF THE LATEST TO REFERENDUM OPINION POLLS AND ALL THAT BUT SOME OF THE PAPERS TAKE THE LABOUR PARTY TO TASK OVER THEIR PERCEIVED FAILURE TO ENGAGE FULLY WITH THE TASK THE GUARDIAN WHAT IS IT IS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE
AND THE MIRROR AGREES SUGGESTS THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP CANNOT ESCAPE CRITICISM THEY FAILED TO PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS EARLIER THE TELEGRAPH ARGUES THE LABOUR OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT THE DEBATE HAS FOCUSED ON DIVISION WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVES BECAUSE HE CLAIMS THE REFERENDUM IS REVEALING THEIR PARTY HAS FAR MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THE FINAL MOMENTS OF SOME OF THE FORTY NINE PEOPLE SHOT DEAD IN A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN FLORIDA ARE WIDELY REPORTED THE TIMES HIGHLIGHTS A VIDEO MADE BY ONE VICTIM AS THE ATTACK BEGAN NINE SHOTS CUTTING ACROSS THE MUSIC DROWNING OUT HER VOICE
THEN ANOTHER BURST OF GUNFIRE AND THE VIDEO CUT OUT THE PAPER GOES ON TO PROFILE THE YOUNGEST VICTIM NINETEEN YEAR OLD CHEESE AND JOSEPHAT HE TELEPHONED HIS MOTHER AS HE HAD IN A TOILET CUBICLE AND ACCORDING TO OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS SHE HEARD THE GUNFIRE GETTING CLOSER THE LEAD STORY IN THE TIMES IS ABOUT MICROSOFT BUYING THE NATTERING INSIDE LINKED IN FOR A RECORD TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IT SAYS MICROSOFT'S BIGGEST ACQUISITION EVER IS PART OF A PUSH TO RESHAPE THE COMPANY BUT THE SMARTPHONE ERA BUT GOES ON TO SOUND A NOTE
CAUTION BY NOTING THAT PREVIOUS DETAIL DEALS OFFER SCANT EVIDENCE OF SUCCESS IT GOES AT MICROSOFT BOUGHT NOKIA'S HANDSET UNIT IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOR MORE THAN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WAS FORCED TO WRITE DOWN MOST OF THAT JUST TWO YEARS LATER THAT WAS THE LEAD IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES JUST ONE FINAL NOTE ABOUT STORY IN THE TIMES WHICH REPORTS THAT THE WORCESTER THAT WORCESTER CITY COUNCILLORS BEEN CRITICISED AFTER ANNOUNCING PLANS TO BAN BALLOONS FROM BEING RELEASED BECAUSE OF A FEAR OF LITTERING
THE COUNCILLORS DESCRIBED A PROPOSED INTRODUCTION OF SEVENTY POUND FINES FOR ANYONE CAUGHT RELEASING A HELIUM FILLED BALLOON AS A NO BRAINER BUT PARENTS HAVE ACCUSED THE COUNCIL OF BEING KILLJOYS ACCORDING TO THE PAPER MORE THAN NINETY PER CENT OF RELEASED BALLOONS RISE TO AN ALTITUDE OF THREE KILOMETRES BEFORE BURSTING INTO SMALL FRAGMENTS THAT TIME IS NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN PARTY DIFFERENCES WERE PUT ASIDE YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AS M.P.S CONDEMNED TO THE MURDERS OF FORTY NINE PEOPLE AT A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN FLORIDA HERE'S OUR CORRESPONDENT SEAN CUT
JUST BEFORE HALF PAST THREE IN THE AFTERNOON THE COMMONS SPEAKER JOHN BERCOW ROSE FROM HIS PLACE IN RESPECTFUL MEMORY
OF THE VICTIMS OF THE HOMOPHOBIC TERRORIST SLAUGHTER
IN ORLANDO I SHOULD LIKE TO REQUEST OF COLLEAGUES THAT AT THREE THIRTY
WE OBSERVE ONE MINUTE'S SILENCE
M.P.S STOOD WITH THEIR HEADS BOWED THE MINUTE'S SILENCE WAS FOLLOWED BY SOMBRE EXCHANGES ABOUT THE MURDERS AT THE PULSE NIGHT CLUB THE ATTACKS IN ORLANDO ON SATURDAY NIGHT BUT UTTERLY EVIL AND THE GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS THEM COMPLETELY
THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY SAID THE U.S. AUTHORITIES WERE TREATING THE MURDERS AS A TERRORIST ATTACK IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH AN ATTACK HAS ITS ROOTS IN A TWISTED IDEOLOGY WHICH COUNTS HOMOPHOBIA AS A CORNERSTONE OF ITS WARPED WORLD VIEW
THIS WAS NOT JUST AN ACT OF TERROR BUT AN ACT OF HOMOPHOBIC HATRED
THE LABOUR M.P. STEPHEN DOUGHTY WHO'D ASKED ABOUT THE DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY SAID L.G.B.T. PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WERE ATTACKED AND DIED EVERY DAY EVERY BIT OF HATES WE CHIP AWAY AND REPLACED WITH LOVE IS HELPING TO CHANGE OUR WORLD FOR THE BETTER
SO WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT LOVE WINS EVEN IN THE ENDS EVEN IN DARK HORRIFIC TIMES AND WE SHOULD GO OUT PROUD AND MARCHING PRIDE HOLD HANDS WITH A LOVED ONE'S KISS THEM STAND UP AGAINST THE HATERS THE KILLERS AND THE BIGOTS AND NEVER FORGET THE SLAIN OF ORLANDO OR AS SO MANY WHO HAVE STOOD BRAVELY IN THE CAUSE OF EQUALITY AND LOVE THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY
YES EM PEAS JOHN NICHOLSON SAID LOVE AND TOLERANCE SHOULD SERVE AS THE EPITAPH FOR THOSE WHO DIED I'M A GAY MAN AND LETTERS ALL SEE UNAMBIGUOUSLY WHAT HAPPENED AND ORLANDO YESTERDAY IT WAS A PREMEDITATED SLAUGHTER OF GAY PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WERE GAY
I AM A MAN WHO WERE TOLD HAD BEEN OUTRAGED BECAUSE HE RECENTLY SAW TWO MEN KISSING IT WAS THE WORST MASS KILLING OF GAY PEOPLE IN OUR LIFETIME
THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM SAID IT HAD BEEN A SICKENING ATTACK OVER THE WEEKS AHEAD THERE ARE MANY PRIDE CELEBRATIONS PLANNED ACROSS THE U.K. INCLUDING LARGE SCALE EVENTS IN LONDON BRIGHTON AND MANCHESTER AND PEOPLE WILL BE RIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SECURITY OF THOSE EVENTS
THERESA MAY SAID POLICE FORCES IN THE U.K. HAD BEEN ASKED TO REVIEW SECURITY FOR LARGE SCALE PUBLIC MEETINGS AND IN PARTICULAR L.G.B.T. EVENTS INCLUDING THIS MONTH'S GAY PRIDE CELEBRATIONS ANDY BURNHAM AND THE HOME SECRETARY BOTH CONDEMNED A MESSAGE POSTED ON TWITTER BY THE LEAVE DOS Y. YOU GROUP WHICH SUGGESTED E.U. MEMBERSHIP INCREASED THE RISKS OF WHAT IT CALLED AN ORLANDO STYLE ATROCITY THE MESSAGE WAS LATER DELETED
THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. NIGEL EVANS SAID HIS STOMACH TURNED WHEN HE SAW THE REPORTS FROM ORLANDO AND HE CALLED FOR THE RAINBOW FLAG TO BE FLOWN AT BRITISH EMBASSIES AND HIGH COMMISSIONS DURING GAY PRIDE WEEK IN ORDER THAT WE CAN SEND OUT THE MESSAGE OF OUR SUPPORT FOR L.G.B.T. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
THE S.N.P. IS JOANNA CHERRY SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ATTACKS HAD BEEN MOTIVATED BY HOMOPHOBIA AND TRAINED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE L.G.B.T. I.Q.
IN YEARS GONE BY WHEN I CAME OUT THIRTY YEARS AGO USED TO BE WE USED TO BE AFRAID TO BRING INTO CLUBS AND BARS FOR A FEW YEARS OF INSULTS AND VIOLENCE FROM ONE WE CURSE WE HAD CAUGHT THAT THOSE THESE WERE LONG GONE
A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT FORMER CABINET MINISTER ALISTAIR CARMICHAEL WANTED THE HOME SECRETARY TO BE A CANDID FRIEND TO THE UNITED STATES AND SAY IT WAS TIME TO LOOK AGAIN AT THE GUN LAWS IN AMERICA
THE INTENDED TARGETS OF THE SPECIAL SOME HOMOPHOBIC ATTACK MAY HAVE BEEN THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY OF OUR LAND BUT WE SHOULD REGARD THAT AS AN ATTACK ON US ALL
A LABOUR M.P. WHERE STREET ING EXPRESSED HIS SOLIDARITY WITH THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY IN ORLANDO AND SAID HE SPOKE FOR ALL THE FAITH COMMUNITIES IN HIS CONSTITUENCY
IN MY CONSTITUENCY M.P. OFFERED NORTH MUSLIMS DON'T MURDER GO PEOPLE THEY ELECT THEM
A CONSERVATIVE IAN STEWART HAS SPOKEN ABOUT HOW HE WAS BULLIED AT SCHOOL FOR BEING GAY YESTERDAY HE WAS ONE OF MANY M.P.S WHO CALLED FOR A RENEWED EFFORT TO TACKLE HOMOPHOBIA
AND HE QUOTED THE MOTHER OF A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS UNACCOUNTED FOR IN THE WAKE OF SUNDAY'S ATTACK
WE HAVE RELATIVELY FEW YEARS ON THIS PLANET WHY DID WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME OF IT HATING EACH OTHER
ATROCITY HAS A TERRORIST LEAGUE BUT SO MANY ATTACKS ON US OR NOT
AT THE END OF THE EXCHANGES THE SPEAKER JOHN BERCOW SAID HE INTENDED TO WRITE TO THE MAYOR OF ORLANDO TO CONVEY PARLIAMENT PROFOUND SHOCK AND SYMPATHY

COLIN PATERSON REPORTING THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IF YOU WERE IN ANY DOUBT ABOUT THE WAY THE SUN WOULD URGE ITS READERS TO VOTE IN NEXT WEEK'S REFERENDUM THIS MORNING'S FRONT PAGE CONFIRMS THE PAPERS STANCE BELIEVE IN BRITAIN IT SAYS WITH THE BELIEVE SPELT B. E. L. E. A. V. E. WERE ASSOCIATE WE'RE JOINED NOW BY TREVOR CABINET THE ASSOCIATE EDITOR OF THE SUN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WE CAN'T HAVE BEEN MUCH DOUBT THAT YOU WOULD TELL YOUR READERS TO VOTE THIS WAY
HE WOULD HAVE SHOT ME IF WE HADN'T HAVE BEEN PURSUING A LONG A LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN ON THE SUBJECT FOR THE FORTY YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A NEWSPAPER AND ONE OF THE REASONS YOU CAN AFFORD IN THE PEACE THAT IS ON THE FRONT PAGE THIS MORNING IS ABOUT THE RISKS OF STAYING IF WE STAY BRITAIN WILL BE ENGULFED IN A FEW SHORT YEARS BY THIS RELENTLESSLY EXPANDING GERMAN DOMINATED FEDERAL STATE WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I THINK IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF VERY CLEARLY ACTUALLY I LOVE SURPRISE YOU ASKED ME THAT QUESTION BUT IT IS TRUE THAT WE WERE OFF ONCE WE VOTED TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT WE WOULD LOSE MOST OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE WOULD GAIN BY LEAVING ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE WERE GOING BY LEAVING HIS
HAVING CONTROL OVER OUR OWN POLITICAL DECISIONS AND THE POLITICIANS WHO MAKE THEM I BE YOU'RE SAYING STAYING IN WOULD MEAN THAT WE WOULD BE ENGULFED BY THIS GERMAN DOMINATED FEDERAL STATE THE DEAL THAT DAVID CAMERON REACHED WITH FELLOW E.U. LEADERS SPECIFICALLY RECOGNISE AT THE UNITED KINGDOM IS NOT COMMITTED TO FURTHER POLITICAL INTEGRATION INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION SO THE IDEA OF A RELENTLESSLY EXPANDING SUPERSTATE IF THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WOULD NOT INCLUDE BRITON
THAT'S IF YOU BELIEVE THE TERMS OF THE REED NEGOTIATIONS THE TRIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS A LONG AND IGNOBLE TRACK RECORD OF SAYING ONE THING AND DOING COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE PACIFICALLY STATES THAT THIS A GRIND IT OFF WOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE TREATIES IT HAS FROM THE OUTSET DENIED CATEGORICALLY THAT IT HAS ANY INTENTION OF DEVELOPING A FEDERAL EUROPEAN SUPERSTATE
AND YET IT WAS IN THE DOCUMENTS OF FOUNDATION THAT SOVEREIGNTY WILL BE LOST AND IT WILL BE PART OF IT YOU WENT TO THE ONE I'M PUTTING TO YOU WHICH ISN'T AS U.K. HAS IN HER GREEN WILL THAT THAT THAT'S PERHAPS A DIRECTION ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A WHOLE BUT THE U.K. HAS A SPECIFIC EXEMPTION FROM FURTHER INTEGRATION HOLD THE FIVE PRESIDENTS REPORT MAKES IT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CLEAR EXACTLY THE TRAIN LINE OF DIRECTION AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE LEARNED TO OUR COST IN THE PAST THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES IT WHAT IT WANTS
THAT SAYS ONE THING AND DOES ANOTHER AND USUALLY DOES THINGS WHICH ARE ANTI DEMOCRATIC IN FACT THE VERY NATURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT IS THE BIGGEST BLACK MARK AGAINST THE WHOLE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THIS IS PART OF IT THAT DOES NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER THE BLACK MARK THAT YOU PLACE AGAINST THE PRIME MINISTER IN IN THIS PIECE IS IS THAT HE'S MADE WHAT YOU CALL WITLESS ASSURANCES THIS IS THE SAME MAN THAT YOU URGED YOUR READERS TO VOTE FOR A YEAR AGO
YES AND THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES WE HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN BETWEEN DAVID CAMERON CAMERON AND ED MILLIBAND THIS TIME WE HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND GETTING OUT
SO THE MAN THAT YOU URGED READERS TO VOTE FOR YOUR GOAT IS WITLESS IN YOUR VIEW WELL I THINK THAT HE HAS MADE A LOT OF VERY SERIOUS MISTAKES AND HAS BEEN WEAKENED HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I THINK THAT THAT SENTIMENT SHARED NOT JUST BY THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
BY A LOT OF THOSE WHO ACTUALLY SUPPORT REMAIN HE WENT IT WENT FOR THOSE NEGOTIATIONS PROMISE PROMISING FUNDAMENTAL REFORM HE PROMISED THAT IF THEY DIDN'T GET IT HE WOULD LEAVE OR AT LEAST TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WOULD LIVE
HE HAS FAILED TO GET THOSE FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS AND HE TURNS OUT TO HAVE MISLED US BY SAYING THAT IF YOU DIDN'T GET THEM HE WOULD LEAVE IT ALTHOUGH YOU GIVE ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE YOU SAY THAT THIS WOULD ALWAYS HAVE BEEN THE SUN'S POSITION WHATEVER HE WOULD HAVE GOT OUT OF YOUR DEAL WOULDN'T HAVE MADE OF THIS FRONT PAGE ANY DIM OUT WOULD IT THAT IS NOT CORRECT IN FACT
HAD HE COME BACK WITH SOMETHING SUBSTANTIVE ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION BORDER CONTROL AND SERIOUS REFORMS ON WELFARE THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE TO THOSE MATTERS
I THINK A GREAT DEAL OF PEOPLE A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CHANGED THEIR MINDS OR HELD THEIR BREATH AND DECIDED TO STAY I MIGHT HAVE EVEN BEEN TEMPTED MYSELF AND SO FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED IMMIGRATION IS THE BIGGEST POINT THERE ARE THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS THAT THE THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS AT FAULT ON
IMMIGRATION AT THE MOMENT IS THE BIGGEST BUT IT MIGHT HAVE GIVEN AN IMPRESSION THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS AT LEAST LISTENING TO HIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION CITIZENS WHO WERE JUST AS BOTHERED ABOUT MASS IMMIGRATION ACROSS EUROPE AS THEY ARE HERE IN BRITAIN THE OTHER ISSUES ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH I THINK ARE UNAVOIDABLE OVER THE LACK OF DEMOCRACY AND ITS FAILURE ON THE BIG THINGS WHEN IT'S CONFRONTED WITH A PROBLEM SIMPLY CANNOT SOLVE ONE OF THEM OF COURSE IS THE EUROPEAN SINGLE CURRENCY
WHICH EVEN ITS OWN SUPPORTERS LIKE DESCRIBES A HISTORIC ERROR WHICH AGAIN NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT IN BUT WE HAVE A SPECIFIC RECKON WE REFLECT ON THAT HOW MUCH SWAY DO YOU THINK FRONT PAGES LIKE THIS HAVE OVER READERS BECAUSE
WHEN RUPERT MURDOCH SPOKE TO THE LEATHER SAID APPEAR FOR THE LEVERSON INQUIRY HE HE SAID THAT THAT THE HEADLINE THAT YOU RUN YOU RAN BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AFTER JOHN MAJOR WON THE ELECTION IT'S THE SUN WOT WON IT YOU TOLD THE READERS HE SAID THAT WAS TAPES TASTELESS AND WRONG AS AS WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT SORT OF POWER I THINK THAT'S CORRECT I THINK THAT WE CAN ONLY SAY WHAT WE BELIEVE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OUR READERS DO BELIEVE WHAT WE SAY
NOT BECAUSE WE THEM BECAUSE THEY'VE COME TO THAT CONCLUSION THEMSELVES FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS I WOULD SAY THAT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF OUR READERS HAVE BEEN ON THE EURO SCEPTIC SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT AND I THINK THAT THEY ARE WITH US ON THIS IN LARGE NUMBERS DID HE BAKED RUPERT MURDOCH DID HE MAKE THE DECISION THE DECISION WAS MADE BY THE OTHERS ARE O.K. TREVOR CABIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
JOHN IS QUARTER PAST SEVEN THE KILLING OF FORTY NINE PEOPLE IN THE GAY NIGHT CLUB BY A MAN CLAIMING TO HAVE BEEN ACTING ON BEHALF OF ISLAM HAS PLEASE MUSLIMS IN THE UNITED STATES IN AN UNWELCOME SPOTLIGHT ONCE AGAIN THE MURDEROUS ACTION OF ONE EXTREMIST AFFECTING THEM EVEN AS THEY LINE UP WITH THE REST OF SOCIETY TO CONDEMN IT ALI MOBIL REPORTS FROM THE ISLAMIC CENTRE OF ORLANDO MY NAME IS
ALI YOU LIVE CLOSE TO THE PULSE BY CLUBS AROUND BASICALLY WAS WITH HER SISTER
SO WHAT WAS THE FIRST YOU KNEW ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED
I STARTED HEARING POPPING SOUNDS FROM OUTSIDE OF MY WINDOW AND IT WENT ON FOR A MINUTE
AND I KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG I KNEW THERE WAS GUNFIRE
IMMEDIATELY I WAS AFRAID I WANTED TO HIDE AND I KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO PLACE TO GO I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LOCAL MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND REACH
GIVING COMFORT
AND THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED WHAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE
INITIALLY I THINK THERE WAS A BIT OF DISCOMFORT ABOUT AS WE AS WE ARE
WE ARE HERE AS AS ONE COMMUNITY AS ONE OF THE LAND OF COMMUNITY
THEY BECAME VERY MUCH MORE RECEPTIVE WE WERE ALL CRYING WE WERE ALL HUH
WE DID WHAT WE COULD MY NAME AS IN THE MINE AND STUDY THERE ARE SOME
ON TWITTER AND SOCIAL MEDIA SAYING HERE WE GO AGAIN ANOTHER MUSLIM EXTREMIST WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT
I CAN DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THEIR REACTION BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THEM IS THIS MASK HERE WERE HERDING WE FEEL THE PAIN JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER AMERICAN
BUT LET'S NOT LET ONE INDIVIDUAL OR THE FINE
AN ENTIRE PEOPLE THEY'RE SUCH AN OUTPOURING OF GRIEF AND SYMPATHY EVERYBODY WANT TO COME TOGETHER
MY NAME IS SOPHIA ANSARI SOPHIA ARE YOU OR ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT A BACKLASH TO SOME DEGREE
DON'T COVER SO I'M NANA'S OVER WE MUST SWIM AS AS YOU KNOW SOME OF MY OTHER FRIENDS UNDER SIR NO WORRIES MY FROM MY MY SISTER'S AND COVER THEIR HAIR WHO ARE MORE OVERTLY MUSTH
BUT OF COURSE I MEAN MY SON'S STARTING SUMMER CAMP ON MONDAY AND YOU KNOW I WORRY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT ARE PEOPLE GOING TO SAY HOW MANY THIS IS THIS IS HERE THIS IS FOUL
WHAT'S YOUR NAME RUSSIA WARWICK I WAS IN COMPLETE SHOCK I IMMEDIATELY WERE IN CONTACT WITH FRIENDS THAT WERE A WEEK THAT REALLY MAKE SURE THAT MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES FROM THE L.G.B.T. CUBED REALLY WE'RE O.K. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT I WORK WITH THAT PEOPLE
THAT HAVE STOOD UP FOR THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND WE'VE STOOD UP FOR THEM AS WHAT'S HAPPENED CHANGING WITH IT NO NOT AT ALL I THINK OUR HUGS WERE TIGHTER WE REACHED OUT TO EACH OTHER AS THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT
YOU'RE STANDING TOGETHER AND THAT GUT FEELING A PRIORY IN THE NORTH NO QUEUING ANY WHATSOEVER WHAT FIANCEE
NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE WE ONE OF YOU TELL US
THAT WAS A LEMUR BULL REPORTING THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE SHOWING SIGNS OF NERVOUSNESS AHEAD OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHICH IS JUST NINE DAYS AWAY DOMINIC O'CONNELL HAS MORE ON THAT FROM ME THANKS MICHELLE BIG INVESTORS HAVE STARTED TO POSITION THEMSELVES AHEAD OF THE VOTE
CURRENCY MARKETS AWAY MOST OF THE ACTION IS AS TRADERS EXPECT VOLATILITY AND STIRLING REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE POLL TO TO DISCUSS THIS I'M JOINED BY LUCULLUS PRESIDENT OF MAN GROUP THE WORLD'S LARGEST LISTED HEDGE FUND LIQUID SEEMED QUITE A LOT OF MONEY GOING INTO WHAT ARE CALLED SHORT POSITIONS AND STERLING PEOPLE BEATING THAT STEERING WILL FALL AHEAD OF THE POLE AND PERHAPS AFTER THE POLE AT THESE SPECULATIVE BITS ARE PEOPLE TRYING TO CALL THE OUTCOME
NO I THINK MOST OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS PEOPLE LEAVE REDUCING RISK OR HEDGING EXPLOSIONS THE ANSWER IS NOBODY CAN WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT STERLING WILL MOVE AFTER THE RESULT NOBODY CAN PREDICT THE RESULT SO YOU'VE GOT A JUMP SITUATION
IN THAT SORT OF THING SPECULATING IS REALLY MORE OF A FIFTY FIFTY BET HE'S NOT THE SORT OF THING PEOPLE LIKE TO DO SO IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT HEDGING THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE SO IN THE CASE OF MAN GROUP YOUR COMPANY FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE EXPOSURES AND ONE CURRENCY AND EXPOSURE TO STIRLING AS WELL AND YOU JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT CAUGHT OUT TOO BADLY SHOULD THE SHIP SHOULD BE STEALING FOR DON'T THINK IF YOU JUST TAKE US AS A SIMPLE COMPANY WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPENDITURES IN STIRLING WE HAVE A LOT OF INCOME IN DOLLARS
AND SO WE HAVE AN EXPOSURE TO A JUMP IN THE PROCESS OF THE DOLLAR STERLING RATE IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE SORT OF HEDGING WE HAVE SIMILAR EXPOSURES WITHIN OUR PORTFOLIOS WE HAVE TO WONDER ABOUT HEDGING THEM A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HEDGING MADE MORE SENSE THE PRICE SOME HEDGING HAS GONE UP A LOT THE PRICE OF OPTIONS HAS GONE UP A LOT BASICALLY MEANS TODAY THE HEDGE IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO PAY OFF WITH NOTHING
SO TRADERS LOVE VOLATILITY DON'T THEY THAT'S WHERE THEY CAN MAKE MONEY THEY DON'T KID TOO MUCH ABOUT THE OUTCOME BUT THEY BUT THEY CAME IT'S GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRADE SO TRADERS HATE UNCERTAINTY SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE MARKETS IS THAT NERVOUSNESS QUESTION WAS RIGHT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REDUCING RISK GOING INTO AN EVENT LIKE THIS WHICH YOU CAN'T PREDICT
PEOPLE REDUCE THEIR RISK WHAT THEY LIKE AFTERWARDS HE'S NOT VOLATILITY AND BOUNCES UP AND DOWN BUT SIGNIFICANT MOVES NOW
THE STIRLING ONE WILL PROBABLY HAPPEN MUCH TOO QUICKLY FOR ANYBODY TO REALLY MAKE ANY MONEY BUT THERE WILL BE FOLLOW ON MOVES INEQUITIES IN BARNS AND IN OTHER MARKINGS WERE ALSO LIVING IN AN UNUSUAL TIMES WE ARE VERY LOW INTEREST RATES NEGATIVE BOND YIELDS WHICH IS A VERY ODD OCCURRENCE WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THIS IS THE KIND OF ODD WITH THERE YOU GET BEFORE A STORM ALL THE STIMULUS PUMPED AND DO YOU DO YOU THINK THERE WAS A DANGER OF A OF A SNAP BACK ON THIS
AT SOME POINT I THINK THE SNAP BACK IS ALMOST INEVITABLE BUT IT COULD BE A LONG WAY AWAY THE PROCESS TO PUSH THE LOWER LOWER RATES HAS LESS AND LESS IMPACT THE Q.E. HE'S HAD LESS AND LESS IMPACT IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF TRYING TO SHIFT A VERY BIG THING WITH A SMALL EFFORT SO IT'S BEST EXAMPLE I CAN HAVE IT'S LIKE TRYING TO MOVE A CONCRETE BLOCK WITH A RUBBER BAND YOU PULL YOU PULL NOTHING SEEMS TO HAPPEN AND THEN AT SOME POINT THE RUB OF THE RUBBER BAND WILL MOVE IT AND THE CONCRETE BLOCK WILL FLY IN YOUR FACE
BUT WHEN THAT STEP BACK HAPPENS COULD BE COULD BE QUITE NASTY WE'RE GOING COULD BE MONTHS OR IT COULD BE YEARS YES THANK YOU MUCH LUCULLUS PRESIDENT OF MEN GROUP THEY STOLE IT TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN BLINDER CAMPAIGNERS ARE GOING TO COURT TODAY TO TRY TO STOP HER COUNCIL TURNING OFF SOME TRAFFIC LIGHTS THE LIGHTS ARE IN READING AND THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN LED BY SIMON GOOD ALL FORMER PARALYMPIAN WHO WAS LOST MOST OF HIS SIDE HE IS ON THE LINE AND WE'LL BE IN THE STUDIO RICHARD WINNINGS WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF TRANSPORT OF THE INSTITUTE
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS IT'S A GOOD ALL YOUR PROBLEM IS YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT YOU CAN'T CROSS THE ROAD SAFELY IF THESE LIGHTS ARE TURNED OFF AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO CROSS THE ROAD SAFELY
ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE ROADS WERE GETTING BUSIER AND TRAFFIC LIGHTS WERE CREATED TO HELP PEOPLE CROSS THE ROAD SAFELY THERE'S MORE CARS ON THE ROAD YET THEY WANT TO TAKE TRAFFIC LIGHTS AWAY THAT TO ME SEEMED LIKE A RIDICULOUS SITUATION AND IT'S HAPPENED FOR A TRIAL PERIOD AND THE COUNCIL SAID WELL IT'S WORKED BECAUSE THERE'S LESS TRAFFIC JAM AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT
I'M AVOIDING GOING INTO READING AND I'M SURE A LOT OF THE DISABLED PEOPLE ARE TOO I I FIND IT REALLY HARD TO TO FEEL LIKE I'M EXCLUDED FROM GOING TO AN AREA BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY THE SAFE ABILITY TO CROSS A ROAD I FIND THAT HARD TO TURN ALL RIGHT SWALLOW LET'S LOOK AT THE AT THE EFFECTS RICHLY WELLINGS IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT
THE FEWER TRAFFIC LIGHTS THERE ARE THE BETTER THE TRAFFIC FLOWS
YES AND IT'S ALSO TENDS TO BE BETTER FOR THEIR SAFETY ALMOST COUNTER INTUITIVELY BECAUSE OF COURSE WHEN YOU HAVE TRAFFIC LIGHTS MOTORISTS SPEED UP TO TRY AND GET THROUGH ON GREEN
AND THEN SUDDENLY SLAM ON THE BRAKES WHEN IT TURNS RED YOU GET THIS STOP START AND IT'S ALSO VERY UNEQUAL WITH A PRIORITY GIVEN TO MOST OF THE TIME TO ROAD VEHICLES AND THEN OCCASIONALLY TO PEDESTRIANS SO THERE'S A STRONG CASE FROM MOVING FROM THE STOP START TO LOW SPEED ENVIRONMENTS WHERE ALL ROAD USERS ARE TREATED EQUALLY AND WE SEE WHEN WE DO THIS WHEN YOU TAKE OUT THE LIGHTS YOU SEE BIG SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS ARE MASSIVE REDUCTIONS IN THE ACCIDENT RATE PARTICULARLY IN SERIOUS ACCIDENTS WE STANDS TO REASON BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT HAVING THIS
VERY FAST ACCELERATION FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO GET THROUGH ON ON GREEN CAN SEE THAT BUT FROM SOMEBODY FOR THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEBODY LIKE MY GOOD OR INDEED ANY OTHER PEDESTRIAN IF YOU HAD TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND THERE'S A GREEN PEDESTRIAN LIKE THAT ALONE SEE YOU
ACROSS WITHOUT ANY IN THE CERTAINTY THAT THERE IS NO OTHER TRAFFIC AND BE ABLE TO THREATEN YOU IN ANY WAY AT ALL THAT'S BOUND TO BE SAFER FOR THE PEDESTRIAN SPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE DISABLED AS MY GOOD KNOWLEDGE
I THINK OVERALL THE OTHER PROM WITH WITH THIS SORT OF COMMANDING CONTROL PHILOSOPHY BEHIND REALISES THAT IT CHANGES THE DRIVING CULTURE SO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD WHAT TO DO ALL THE TIME WHERE IF YOU IF YOU MOVE AWAY FROM THAT GIVE RESPONSIBILITY BACK TO INDIVIDUAL ROAD BUT THEY'VE GOT TO STOP THAT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT IS YOU SAY COMMANDING A TROLL AS THOUGH IT'S A BAD THING BUT IT'S A GOOD THING ISN'T IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE GOOD ALL AGAIN OR INDEED ANY OTHER PEDESTRIAN IF YOU HAVE TO STOP THE LIGHT IS ON RED SO THAT PEDESTRIANS CAN CROSS THEREFORE YOU STOP
WELL OF COURSE THEY DON'T ALWAYS STOP AT ANYONE WHO HAD HIS NICE WELL OFTEN THEY DON'T HAVE ZEBRA CROSSINGS FOR EXAMPLE IN LONDON ON A ZEBRA CROSSING TRY ONE THING I THINK THAT IT CHANGES THE DRIVING CULTURE IF YOU REMOVE THIS COMMAND AND CONTROL THE PEOPLE START TO CO OPERATE AND YOU SEE THAT A DRIVERS WERE TO GIVE WAY TO VULNERABLE ROAD USERS THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND AND WE LOOKED AT THE CASE STUDIES WHERE THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN OF COURSE FOR A HUGE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM
REMOVING BEFORE YOU GO ON TO THAT THE BETTER STAY WITH THE DISABLED ROADIES ARE FOR A MINUTE BECAUSE MY GOOD I'M SPEAKING YOU ARE SPEAK FOR YOURSELF YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD BE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE STOPPING OR NOT WELL THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN I CAN TURN UP TO PAVEMENT EDGE CAR COMING FROM MY RIGHT WILL STOP WHICH WILL GIVE ME THAT PORTION OF THE ROAD WHO'S TO SAY THE DRIVER COMING FROM THE LEFT HE'S IS SUBSCRIBING TO THE SAME THOUGHT AS A DRIVER ON THE RIGHT I WILL STOP FOR SOMEONE
WHO WANTS TO CROSS THE ROAD AND IT'S VERY EASY FOR THESE PEOPLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT OH IT WILL SPEED UP TRAFFIC AND EVERYONE WILL ALL BE LOVELY AND GIVE WAY TO EVERYONE TRY BEING DISABLED TRIED BEING BLIND TRY HAVING A GUIDE DOG TRY STRUGGLING TO COME OUT OF YOUR FRONT DOOR EVERY DAY AND PUT YOURSELF IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THESE THESE TRAFFIC IDEAS ARE BOUGHT BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA ABOUT DISABILITY AND SPECIFICALLY ABOUT BLINDNESS AS WELL
AND I THINK THAT'S UNFAIR BECAUSE YOU'VE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE EFFECTS ON THE LOCAL ROAD USERS ON OF COURSE THE LINE PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY WELL THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES LOOKING AT THEIR PERCEPTIONS AND IT IS TRUE THAT THEY TEND TO BE MORE FEARFUL IF YOU REMOVE THE CONTROLS BUT THE CHANGE THINGS IT TAKES A WHILE FOR PEOPLE TO GET USED TO THE DIFFERENT SITUATION IN THEM'S A CHANGE IN THE CULTURE YOU GET MORE EQUALITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT ROAD USERS AND PEOPLE START TO CO OPERATE MORE AND THEN THIS SENSE OF BEING BENNETT OVERALL BENEFIT IN TERMS OF SAFETY'S DRIVERS START TO GIVE WAY THEY SLIT LOW THEIR SPEED
REMOVE THE STOP START ACCELERATION AND BRAKING AND THEN YOU GET A MOVE ON THROUGH YOU OF COURSE WE SHOULDN'T NEGLECT THEIR ECONOMIC BENEFITS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A HUGE INCREASE IN TRAFFIC CONTROL'S IMPOSING HUGE COS ACROSS THE WIDER ECONOMY OF COURSE IF YOU HAMPER THE ECONOMY THEM IT MEANS LESS MONEY TO SUPPORT VARIOUS VULNERABLE GROUPS SAFETY COMES FIRST SURELY YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T SIT THERE AND SAY OF THE ECONOMY WOULD BE A FAR BETTER PLACE IF WE MOVED OR TRAFFIC LIGHTS
THAT'S JUST A RIDICULOUS I'M NOT STAYING TO MOVE ALL OF THEM BOTH OFTEN THEY'RE VERY FOR OVER EXTENDED TO PLACES WHERE THEY COST FAR KEEP PEOPLE IN LONDON DON'T HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR ANY ANY ROPE OR ANY OF ANY OTHER ROAD USER LET ALONE A PEDESTRIAN WELL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT AT THAT POINT I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE YOUR SAY IN COURT THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US SIMON GOODALL AND RICHARD WELL THANK YOU

THANKS DON'T KNOW I THINK HE'S A VERY SIMPLY SIMPLY FLICK SIMPLISTIC ARGUMENT THAT IT'S SOME OTHER RING OF FOREIGN FANS ORCHARDS ARE QUITE COMPLEX GROUP OF FANS FROM ACROSS EUROPE THEY VARY FROM CULTURE TO CULTURE FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY YOU FOOTBALL IS THE MOST POPULAR SPORT IN THE WORLD AND THEREFORE FANS COME IN MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES
ALL IS PREDOMINANTLY ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN WHAT'S CALLED T. FOES OR CHOREOGRAPHY T. FOLLOWS T. FOES IS FROM TIV TEE FO WHICH IS THE ITALIAN FOR FOOTBALL AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE PASSIONATE ORIGINATE IN ITALY FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES THEY IS A PARTICULARLY TURBULENT POLITICAL TIME THE RE EMERGENCE OF FASCISM AND FAR LEFT EXTREMISM POLITICAL TERRORISM
AND THEY TOOK THE THE PARAPHERNALIA FROM THE PLA SCHOOL PROTEST FROM THE STREETS OF THE PIAZZAS INTO THE STADIUM TO THE FLAGS THE BANNERS THE POLITICAL STATEMENTS OVER TIME IT WAS INFLUENCED BY BRITISH HOOLIGANISM IN ITALY IN THE VIOLENT SORT OF WAS PART BECAME PART OF THE CULTURE FOR SOME OF THEM AND WHEN IT'S SPREAD ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN AND I WENT INTO POLAND THE FAITH OF THEIR PASSION ON THE STOPPER BEING THUGS DOES IT WELL
THAT DOESN'T STOP ANYONE FROM BEING FOR FOLKS THAT THEY'D ALSO THUGS BUT I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT BUT THIS PARTICULAR BUNCH DO SEEM TO BE GOING OUT SPECIFICALLY IN ORDER TO BEAT UP PEOPLE TO MAKE TROUBLE I MEAN THAT SEEMS TO BE THE RAISON D'ETRE WELL BEING FROM THE REPORTS ARE COMING FROM THE GROUND THAN IT DOES SEEM THAT THIS GROUP ARE LOOKING FOR VIOLENCE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE ORCHARDS OR VIOLENCE OR EVEN AT THEIR AUCTION I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SELF SELF IDENTIFYING IT ALTERS FROM CONTACTS IN RUSSIA
THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T SEE THEMSELVES ULTRAS EITHER OR I DON'T KNOW JIMMY CONNORS WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT WHAT IT'S REALLY CONCERNING I THINK WE'D LOOK AT IT AND THINK IT'S THE WORST IT REMINDS US OF THE WORST EXCESSES OF FOOTBALL VIOLENCE IN ENGLAND IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND I THINK WHAT'S ALSO BEEN REALLY WORRYING IS THE RESPONSE FROM PEOPLE IN RUSSIA TO THE BEHAVIOUR OF THEIR FANS AND THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES HAVE SAID THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS FIGHTING WAS PROVOKED BY AGGRESSIVE RUSSIAN GANGS TARGETING I'VE SUPPORTED BUT WHEN YOU GET
PEOPLE LIKE IGOR LEOPARD F. NOT ONLY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT BUT ALSO ON THE EXECUTIVE OF THE RUSSIAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION BASICALLY DEFENDING THE ACTION OF THE FANS AND MORE AT HOME TO KEEP IT UP YOU QUESTION DO PEOPLE IN RUSSIA TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AS THEY SHOULD HAVE GOT IT SORRY I WAS GONNA SAY DON'T YOU ALWAYS WEAR YOU'VE GOT ONE BUNCH OF FANS BLAMING ANOTHER ONE THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS ISN'T IT BUT I THINK
THIS THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES SAYING THAT IT'S IT IS THE FRENCH THE RUSSIANS IN THIS CASE WHO PROVOKED IT THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE ARRAS MONSTERS REALLY CLEAR ENGLISH FANS WERE CAUGHT UP IN THIS YOU DO WRONG SHOULD BE PUNISHED AND SOME HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED I KNOW WE NEED SENT TO DRILL AND ABSOLUTELY WITH THE F.A. AND OUR POLICE AND HOME OFFICE WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY FANS WERE CAUSING TROUBLE TO REMOVE THEM IN SOME CASES REMOVE THEIR PASSPORTS SO THEY CAN'T TRAVEL
IS RUSSIA PUTTING THE SAME ENERGY BEHIND IT BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THE F.A. EXECUTIVE HAD SAID BASICALLY ENGLAND ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING BUT THEY'LL BE DRUMMED OUT OF OFFICE QUITE RIGHTLY BUT HE'S THE SAME PRESSURE BEING APPLIED IN RUSSIA DOES RUSSIA TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION NOT JUST FOR THIS TOURNAMENT BUT IN TWO YEARS' TIME RUSSIA WILL BE HOSTING THE WORLD CUP
SO HOW ARE WE CONVINCED AT THE VAN EXPERIENCE IN RUSSIA IS GOING TO BE A GOOD ONE IF THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES DON'T SEEM THAT INTERESTED OR WILLING TO CONTROL THEIR HOOLIGANS AND DOCTOR DODGE YOU CAN'T OR CAN YOU APPEAL TO THESE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SAY LOOK AT IF YOU CARRY ON DOING THIS SORT OF THING IN THE END YOU'RE GOING TO DESTROY WHAT YOU AND JOY THAT IS THE GAME OF FOOTBALL YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT SORT OF APPEAL
I THINK IT COMES BACK TO YOUR POINT ABOUT IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT ONE SIDE OF FANS AGAINST ANOTHER SIDE OF FANS WHICH FITS INTO FOOTBALL FAN CULTURE BUT ACTUALLY YOU CAN APPEAL TO PEOPLE AND THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU CAN EDUCATE AND PUT IN PLACE CERTAIN
PROCEDURES AND STRUCTURES AND LAWS THAT CAMERA'S AGAINST AGAINST IT TO SAY THAT YOU CAN'T IS TO SAY THAT WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH THE PROBLEM IN BRITAIN TO SAY THAT IT'S WHAT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN RUSSIA AS DAMIEN SAYS HE'S OH IT'S HAPPENING IN FRANCE RIGHT NOW AND WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THE POLICING THE ORGANISATION BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME FANS WHO WERE LOOKING FOR TROUBLE BUT NOT ALL OF THEM AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CAUGHT UP IN IT
ARE CAUGHT UP IN IT BECAUSE OF EXTREME POLICE THE C.R.S. USE TEAR GAS AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THEY DON'T DEAL WITH MINOR INFRINGEMENTS AND THIS HELPS ESCALATE THE PROBLEM AND MAKE IT MUCH WORSE AND THAT'S GOT TO BE LOOKED AT AS PART OF AN OVERALL PACKAGE RATHER THAN JUST SORT OF LABELLING ALL FOOTBALL FANS AS POTENTIAL TROUBLE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT IS THIS THING ABOUT WHAT THE FRENCH DO AS IMPORTANT AS WELL ISN'T IT BECAUSE
THE WAY WE DEALT WITH HOOLIGANISM IN IN THE PAST WE STILL HAVE SOME OF IT OBVIOUSLY BUT NOTHING LIKE IT USED TO BE WAS BY BETTER POLICING BETTER STADIUMS AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING THAT THE POLICING IN FRANCE SEEMS NOT TO BE UP TO SCRATCH THAT'S RIGHT I THINK I THINK I MADE THIS IN NO WAY CONDONES WHAT HAPPENED BUT I THINK THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FOR THE POLICING I THINK ALSO UEFA SHOULD LOOK AT AFTER THE DRAW IS MADE FOR A TOURNAMENT IT'S QUITE CLEAR WHICH COUNTRY'S GONNA BE PLAYING WHERE AND WHEN
SHOULD THEY REVIEW WHERE WHICH WITCH STADIA THEY'LL BE PLAYING AND WHERE THE MATCH IS GOING TO DO THAT THEY HAVE IN THE PAST BUT I THINK THEY WERE HE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE I THINK IN THIS CASE WHERE YOU'VE HAD ENGLAND AND RUSSIA RUSSIAN HELD UP IN MARSEILLES FOR DAYS BEFORE A MATCH AND THEY ARE BOTH HAVING TO TRAVEL TO THE NORTH OF FRANCE TO PLAY ENTAILS MORE LESS NEXT TO EACH OTHER A DAY APART IS THAT CREATING A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE TROUBLE IS MORE LIKELY I THINK THE BIG TEST FOR UEFA NOW IS TO TURN ROUND TOO
COUNTRIES HAVE WARNED ENGLAND RUSSIA BUT I THINK PARTICULARLY SAID TO RUSSIA AND THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES YOU NEED TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE TO DEMONSTRATE YOU'RE IN CONTROL AND A TARGETING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T THEN WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO KICK YOU UP THE TOURNAMENT AND FEVER I THINK NOW I HAVE TO BE SAYING TO RUSSIA THIS TOURNAMENT RAISES SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE FOUND SAFETY IN VAN EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD CUP IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO ADDRESS THAT YOU WHERE THEY PICK THEM OUT THEY MOVE THE WORLD CUP AS THEY'RE NOT OF THE STATE THAT THAT THAT IS ALWAYS THE ULTIMATE THREAT I THINK
FEE FOR HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND SAY SURELY THIS RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY POLICING WILL BE CONDUCTED IN RUSSIAN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN HE'S TO BE A PROPER STRATEGY IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T SEE A REPEAT OF THE SCENES PARTICULARLY IF THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT RUSSIAN GAMES ARE TARGETING THE PHONES WERE THE COUNTRY'S THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH DAMIAN COLLINS AND MARK DODGE THE TIME HE'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND ON THE DAY THE SUN OFFICIALLY ENDORSES THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN JEREMY CORBIN IS TO MOBILISE THE WHOLE LABOUR MOVEMENT TO SUPPORT REMAIN ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN
AMID GROWING ALARM THAT WARNINGS ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT INROADS ON THE DOORSTEP WITH REFERENDUM VOTERS THE TIME SAYS MISTER CORBIN'S INTERVENTION FOLLOWS GROWING CRITICISM FROM WITHIN LABOUR OVER HIS FAILURE TO SHOW LEADERSHIP ON EUROPE FOR THE MALE YESTERDAY'S FIGHT BACK BY GORDON BROWN QUICKLY BACKFIRED AS THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER CAME UNDER PRESSURE OVER LABOUR'S PAST RECORD ON IMMIGRATION
THE SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION DOMINATES THE FRONT PAGE OF THE EXPRESS CLAIMS TO HAVE PROOF THAT THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTROL OUR BORDERS IT SAYS MORE THAN FIVE MILLION MIGRANTS HAVE BEEN HANDY E.U. PASSPORTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE GIVING THEM THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN BRITAIN ACCORDING TO TELEGRAPH BRITAIN GRANTED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MIGRANTS CITIZENSHIP LAST YEAR THE THIRD HIGHEST NUMBER OF ANY EUROPEAN NATION THE SUN DESCRIBES THE FIGURES ARE SHOCKING
MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE GUNMAN WHO MURDERED FORTY NINE PEOPLE AT A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN FLORIDA ARE FEATURED IN MOST OF THE PAPERS THE TELEGRAPH SAYS MEMBER TEEN SCOUTED THE DISNEY WORLD RESORT IN ORLANDO IS A POSSIBLE TARGET BEFORE HE CARRIED OUT THE MASSACRE A WITNESS TO THE SHOOTING HAS TOLD THE MAIL METIN WAS LAUGHING FRANTICALLY AS HE SPRAYED HIS VICTIMS WITH BULLETS
FOR THE GUARDIAN OR PICTURES EMERGED OF AN ANGRY FANTASIST WHO INVENTED LINKS TO ISLAMIST TERRORISTS THE GUARDIAN COLUMNIST OWEN JONES WHO WAS HIMSELF GAY HAS EXPLAINED WHY HE STORMED OFF THE SET IN DISGUST DURING A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SHOOTING ON SKY NEWS ON SUNDAY NIGHT HE SAYS HE TOOK OFFENCE WHEN THE PRESENTER CONTINUALLY AND REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO ACCEPT THAT THE ATTACK TARGETED THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY ARGUING THAT THE SEXUALITY OF THE VICTIMS SHOULD NOT BE GLOSSED OVER
MY AN ATROCITY CAN BE MORE THAN ONE THING AT THE SAME TIME THIS HE SAID WAS HOMER PHOBIA AS WELL AS TERRORISM UNDER THE HEADLINE ULTRA EVIL THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MIRROR FEATURES A PHOTOGRAPH OF RUSSIAN HOOLIGANS WHO ALLEGEDLY PLANNED TO ATTACK ENGLISH AND WELSH FOOTBALL FANS AT THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP IT SAYS
BUNGLING FRENCH POLICE FAILED TO ARREST ANY OF THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FAR RIGHT THUGS WHO RIOTED IN MARSEILLES AT THE WEEKEND AND CLAIMS OFFICERS HAVE ADMITTED THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE NOW THE TIME SAYS THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY HAS CALLED ON THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO ASK ITSELF SOME SEARCHING QUESTIONS ABOUT SECURITY AT THE TOURNAMENT AND SCIENTISTS AT ALL THE GUARDIAN THAT HAVING A BIRD BRAIN IS NO LONGER AN INSULT TO OUR FEATHERED FRIENDS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE AS MANY NEURONS
PACKED INSIDE THEIR SCHOLARS MAMMALS AND SOMETIMES THEY HAVE MORE SCREENED AT THIS GIVES BIRDS COGNITIVE ABILITIES THAT ARE MORE THAN A MATCH FOR PRIMATES WITH SIMILAR SIZE BRAINS ACCORDED THE MALE SINGING COMPLEX SONG WAS SEEMS TO BE A MARKER FOR INTELLIGENCE OF LEEDS EXPERTS TO REGARD SONGBIRDS AND PARROTS AS THE INTELLECTUAL RIVAL CHIMPS GORILLAS

WHAT ABOUT THE EFFECT ON FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THAT HOSPITAL MAYBE FROM THE E. BUT I CAN START I'VE GOT NO OBJECTION TO ANY OF THE WORKERS AT WORK IN IVORY
I'VE COME INTO A SMALL MEETING ROOM JUST OFF FROM THE FACTORY FLOOR AND ON THE WALL OF THIS MEETING ROOM VAST TELEVISION SCREEN AND ON IT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THIS COMPANY ROBERTO MARINI WHO'S ACTUALLY IN ITALY ROBERTO IT'S CLEAR THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS THE REASON THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE VOTING OUT HIS IMMIGRATION AND YET IN A SENSE WITH THE HUGE SCALE OF SEASONAL WORKERS YOU'RE ALMOST CONTRIBUTING THE PROBLEM WITH THIS COMPANY HERE AREN'T YOU
ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK THAT MADE THE CASE THE FACT HE'S DEAD TO ME KEN THEODORE'S JOB ONLY BY USING ALSO PEOPLE I'M NOT U.K. CITIZENS WE DOUBT THOSE PEOPLES THE REST OF THE COMPANY IS AT STATE EVEN IF THEY'RE USING HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS AND PERHAPS CLAIMING EXTRA BENEFITS HERE YOU'RE SAYING THAT PRICE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD RECOGNISE HIS WORK

FRENCH ITALIAN AND YOU CASEY DIDN'T SEEM TO KEEP THEIR JOB TWELVE MONTHS A YEAR ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
YES AHEM I AM WORRIED FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I KNOW WHAT GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU STAY IN BUT THIS IS THE LEAVES WINS IT WAS LOCKED

OH DEAR MY HEAD'S HAS OFTEN TOLD ME THAT FROM A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW STAYING IN IS THE OBVIOUS THING TO DO IT'S WHAT WE KNOW
BUT IN FACT AT THE MOMENT AND PREPARING TO VOTE EXIT BECAUSE
NOT HAVING THE POWER TO MAKE OUR OWN DECISIONS IT'S A CREEPING FORM OF AUTHORITARIANISM IN MY VIEW IF YOU STILL RAN YOUR OLD COMPANY WOULD YOU STILL BE VOTING TO LEE
IT WOULD BE A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT DECISION BECAUSE I'M VERY MINDFUL OF THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN DOVER AND OF MY EMPLOYEES WHAT BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS THERE WILL BE A PERIOD A BUSINESS UNCERTAINTY WHEN BUSINESS IS UNCERTAIN PEOPLE STOP PLACING ORDERS
BUT DO YOU THINK IT'S A PRICE WORTH PAYING YES
THAT WAS REPORTING FROM DOVER AND WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM HER BEFORE THE END OF THE PATRON CHARACTERISTICALLY SILENTLY ATTHE MOMENT IT'S TEN TO EIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US THIS MORNING RABBI LAURA JANET CLOSE WE GOOD MORNING LAURA GOOD MORNING JOHN
IT'S INTERNATIONAL PRIDE MONTH AND THE MURDER OF FORTY NINE PEOPLE AT AN ORLANDO GAY CLUB IS A SHOCKING REMINDER OF HOW LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL AND TRANSSEXUAL PEOPLE REMAIN INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE BRITAIN CAN BE PROUD THAT WE HAVE THIRTY FIVE OPENLY GAY LESBIAN OR BISEXUAL M.P.S
OUR FIRST EVER OPENLY GAY BRITISH AMBASSADOR RECENTLY STARTED REPRESENTING BRITAIN AND ISRAEL ACCOMPANIED BY HIS HUSBAND THE NEWLY APPOINTED MASTER OF THE ROLLS THE HEAD OF THE CIVIL JUDICIARY IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS A MARRIED GAY MAN
BUT WE CAN'T BE COMPLACENT PEOPLE IN THE U.S. THE U.K. AND THE WORLD OVER ARE CONCERNED THAT COPYCAT HOMOPHOBIC OR TRANS PHOBIC TERROR ATTACKS WILL HAPPEN WHERE THEY LIVE AS RHINE A GAY PERSON TOLD THE B. B. C. YESTERDAY WHAT SHOCKED US THE MOST IS THAT IT COULD BE US I'M PROUD TO BE THE PARENT OF A BISEXUAL PERSON WHO DEFINED THEMSELVES AS GENDER NON BINARY
FOR THEM THIS MEANS THAT DESPITE BEING BIOLOGICALLY IDENTIFIED AT BIRTH AS A GIRL THEY NOW FEEL NEEDS I LIKE JUST A WOMAN NOR JUST A MAN AND THEY'RE APPROPRIATE PRONOUN IS THEY ALL THEM RATHER THAN SHE OR HE IT TOOK SOME GETTING USED TO BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY BUT IT MEANS THAT THE ORLANDO MURDERS ARE CLOSE TO MY HEART AND TO MY CENTRAL PARENTAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ESPECIALLY CLERGY HAVE A PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY TO SAFEGUARD L.G.B.T. PEOPLE BECAUSE I BELIEVE RELIGIOUS TEXTS HAVE BEEN MISUSED TO JUSTIFY HOMOPHOBIC AND TRANS PHOBIC DISCRIMINATION AND AS WE SAW OVER THE WEEKEND VIOLENCE AND THE BRITISH JEWISH L.G.B.T. ADVOCACY CHARITY IS CALLED CASH IT FOR HEBREW FOR RAINBOW
THE TOUR OUR TEACHERS THAT AT THE END OF THE FLOODS DESTRUCTION GOD PLACED A RAINBOW IN THE MIDST OF THE CLOUDS AND THIS RAINBOW AND EVERY RAINBOW FROM THEN ON IT'S A SIGN THAT GOD WON'T REPEAT THE DEVASTATION OF THE FLOOD AND THE WORLD BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY JUDITH AND EMPHASISES THAT WE CAN'T LEAVE THIS TO GOD IT'S ALSO OUR DUTY AS HUMANITY TO CONFRONT EVIL OR NOT BE SILENT IN THE FACE OF HATRED
THAT WE MUSTN'T STAND IDLY BY WHEN OUR NEIGHBOURS BLOOD IS SHED AND THERE WE HAVE TO RESPECT ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND THE INHERENT VALUE OF ALL HUMAN LIFE WE ARE ALL CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH EACH OTHER BUT WE DO HAVE TO PROTECT EACH OTHER AND TO ENSURE EACH OTHER'S SAFETY
IT'S CRUCIAL THAT L.G.B.T. PEOPLE WHETHER THEY CALL THEMSELVES SHE HE OR THEY CAN LIVE IN SECURITY AND OF COURSE WITH PRIDE
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH RABBI LAURA IF YOUR OTHER CLOSED AT THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO EAT PRESIDENT ALL AUNT HAS CONVENED EMERGENCY TALKS THIS MORNING AFTER A SENIOR FRENCH POLICE OFFICER WAS KNIFED TO DEATH LAST NIGHT A WOMAN THOUGHT TO BE HIS WIFE WAS ALSO KILLED IN A TOWN NORTH WEST OF PARIS
THE FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER BERNARD CASANOVA'S CALLED IT AN ABJECT ACT OF TERRORISM AND A NEWS NEWSAGENCY LINKED TO SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE SAID THE ATTACK HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT BY ONE OF ITS FIGHTERS ARE WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM PARIS BY ME SHOWN WE MOTO HAS THE SECURITY AND TERRORISM CORRESPONDENT FOR THE FRENCH NEWSAGENCY IF THEO JOHN'S FALLS FOR US A GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS ATTACK LAST NIGHT
WEAK YOU POURED THESE FOLLICLES HE'S JUST IN FRONT OF YOU HOME AND KILLED HIM VERY BRUTALLY WE DENY AND AFTER THAT HE WENT IN AND WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT DID HAPPEN
AND START BUILDING THE HOUSE FIND DEAD BODY ULSTER WAY TALK TO POLICEMEN DIDN'T AND HE IS BEING DESCRIBED THE MAN ATTACKED HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER DO WE KNOW WHO HE IS WHO HE WAS
AND IT IS IT IS IT BEING TAKEN AS READ THAT THIS WAS LINKED TO ISLAMIC STATE IT WAS REPORTED BY BY THEIR NEWS AGENCY THAT THAT THE ATTACKER WAS ONE OF ITS FIGHTERS
I'VE BEEN BULLIED MEMBER BUT IT IS TO PUT HIM WHERE HE WILL HAVE TO CHECK ON THIS BUT IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE DO YOU HOW DO YOU LINK THAT DEFINITELY AND WHAT WILL THAT MEAN IN THE WAKE OF THE OF THE PARIS ATTACKS LAST NOVEMBER AND THE STEERS AT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE AT LARGE TO US WHO WERE PART OF THAT RING
SEVERAL
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES HAVE A GOT TO GRIPS WITH THE TERRORIST THREAT IN THE WAKE OF HARRIS AND OBVIOUSLY THAT WITH WITH THE EURO CHAMPIONSHIPS UNDER WAY THERE'S A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON SECURITY AT THE MOMENT
WE WANT EM OUT OF GEO AND WE HAVE TO KEEP KEEP KEEP AN EYE ON THEM AND WE HAVE VOWED TO THE LITERARY READ OF PEOPLE GOING COMING BACK FRONT

WAS THIS ATTACK MORE ABOUT REPRESSED SEXUALITY THAN IT WAS ADHERENCE TO AN ISLAMIST IDEOLOGY
THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP HAS CLAIMED THAT ONE OF ITS FIGHTERS KILLED A SENIOR FRENCH POLICE OFFICER AND A WOMAN THOUGHT TO BE HIS WIFE THE OFFICER WAS STABBED OUTSIDE HIS HOME IN A SUBURB OF PARIS BY A MAN WHO THEN BARRICADED HIMSELF INTO THE HOUSE POLICE WHO RAIDED THE PROPERTY FIND THE BODIES OF THE WOMAN AND THE ATTACKER A THREE YEAR OLD BOY WAS UNHARMED FRENCH GOVERNMENT MINISTERS HAVE HELD AN EMERGENCY MEETING THE INTERIOR MINISTER DESCRIBED THE KILLINGS AS AN APPALLING TERRORIST ACT

MONEY THEIR FUNDING WOULD BE SAFE AFTER A BRECHT'S IT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE U.K.'S NET CONTRIBUTION TO THE E.U. BUDGET WAS ESTIMATED BY THE TREASURY TO BE EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS
VOTE LEAVE SAYS ALL THE SPENDING BRITAIN RECEIVES FROM THE E.U. FOR FARMING SCIENCE CULTURE AND MORE COULD BE COVERED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY AND SPENT MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH MONEY TO SPARE FOR OTHER PRIORITIES INCLUDING THE N.H.S.
BUT THE CAMPAIGN TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE E.U. IS INCREDULOUS ABOUT THE CLAIM SAYING VOTE LEAVE HAS ALREADY MADE SPENDING PROMISES TOTALLING OVER ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS AND MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF ECONOMIC EXPERTS INCLUDING THE S.

THE CHAIRMAN OF THE F.A. GREG DYKE HAS WRITTEN TO EUROPEAN FOOTBALL'S GOVERNING BODY UEFA TO EXPRESS SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS IN LILLE WHERE ENGLAND SUPPORTERS ARE DUE TO GATHER BEFORE THEIR NEXT GAME ENGLAND PLAY IN NEARBY LOSS ON THURSDAY AND RUSSIA PLAY AND LISLE THE DAY BEFORE

THE W.H.O.'S SEEKER COMMITTEE LAST MET IN MARCH SINCE THEN OVER TWO HUNDRED SCIENTISTS HAVE CALLED PUBLICLY FOR THE RIO OLYMPICS TO BE MOVED OR POSTPONED THEY ARGUE THAT WELCOMING THOUSANDS OF SPORTS FANS TO BRAZIL COULD RISK THE VIRUS SPREADING AROUND THE WORLD
SO FAR OF THE W.H.O.'S ADVICE HAS BEEN THAT PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD AVOID THE GAMES AND EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT MOSQUITO BITES THE OLYMPICS ARE BEING HELD IN AUGUST BRAZIL'S WINTER SO MOSQUITO ACTIVITY IS RELATIVELY LOW BUT THE W.H.O. IS UNDER PRESSURE TO BE MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT A DISEASE WHICH IS IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD AND POTENTIALLY VERY DAMAGING
THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO SUFFER FROM PROSTATE PROBLEMS ARE SET TO BENEFIT FROM A NEW LASER TREATMENTS WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE N.H.S.

THE HAVE BEEN HELD AROUND THE UNITED STATES AND IN THIS COUNTRY FROM GLASGOW TO MANCHESTER BIRMINGHAM TO LONDON IN SOHO THE HEART OF LONDON'S GAY NIGHTLIFE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PACKED INTO OLD COMPTON STREET IT'S UP THE VICTIM OF A HOMOPHOBIC TERROR ATTACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE FOR A TWO MINUTE SILENCE A REPORTED EIGHT MCMULLAN WAS THERE
MONDAY EVENINGS IN SOHO AREN'T USUALLY THIS BUSY IN FACT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT RAINBOW FLAGS DRAPED ON EVERY BUILDING AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DRAWN HERE ALL IN COMMON COURSE SOLIDARITY AND WORRY CLAY STARTER STATES ARE HIGH
I JUST THINK IT WAS ONLY MY FRIENDS COULD BE AN ASS COULD HAPPEN HERE OR FRIENDS I'VE TO STAY AS WELL COULD HAVE BEEN
STAND BACK HERE SHOULDER SHOULDER EVERYBODY WE MET IN A GAY CLUB IN CARDIFF CALLED PAUL
WE HAD OUR FIRST KISS THERE AS SO MANY PEOPLE COULD HAVE HAD
AND WOULDN'T BE ABLE FOR THEM NOW
IT'S JUST HORRIBLE AND SQUEEZED IN AMONG THE MASSES THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K. THE LONDON AIR JEREMY CORBIN RUTH DAVIDSON AND THE ODD CABINET MINISTER LIKE THE EDUCATION SECRETARY LUCY MORGAN I THINK IT'S REMARKABLE THAT THIS NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE OUT ON THE STREETS OF LONDON
UNDERSTAND SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OF ORLANDO ROMAN CUISINE IS TRULY HORRIFIC THE INSPECTOR HERE
IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GONE DOWN AND ER IN A NIGHTCLUB THE CROWD ALL SURGED FORWARD TO BE AS CLOSE AS THEY COULD BE TO THE ADMIRAL DUNCAN PUB THE SCENE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO OF ANOTHER TERRORIST ATROCITY AGAINST THE GAY COMMUNITY IN WHICH THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY MAIL
JUST AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK SILENCE FELL IMPECCABLY OBSERVED TEARS AND HUGS AW
I'M SIMON BUCKLEY I'M THE RECTOR OF SAINT ANNE'S CHURCH IN SOHO IT'S A BIT OF DEFIANCE PRIDE AS ALMOST AN ACT OF DEFIANCE THAT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR SO I THINK THE GAY COMMUNITY ARE WELL REHEARSED IN STANDING UP IN THE FACE OF BIGOTRY INTOLERANCE HOMOPHOBIA AND HATRED AND JUST SAYING WE'RE STILL HERE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE
NINE BALLOONS WERE RELEASED INTO THE NIGHT SKY ONE FOR EACH OF THOSE KILLED IN ORLANDO AS THE LONDON GAY MEN'S CHORUS
ALSO IN THE CROWD DAVID MANDEL SCOTTISH SECRETARY WHO CAME OUT IN JANUARY THIS YEAR AT THE AGE OF FIFTY FOUR IF YOU ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITY AND YOU ARE OUT AND YOU'VE GOT TO STAND UP
AGAINST ROMA FOR B. AND I'M VERY VERY PLEASED TO DO THAT ON ANY OCCASION I THOUGHT THERE WASN'T A GREAT CEILING
IN THE CROWD TONIGHT PEOPLE GREAT SINCERITY AND SHEARING OF THE LOSS OF THE CARD IN
THE CROWDS ARE SLOWLY STARTING TO EVER WAY NOW NO ONE REALLY SEEMS TO WANT TO GO HOME THAT FEELING OF SOLIDARITY AND DEFIANCE THAT SO CHARACTERISED THE GAY COMMUNITY OVER THE YEARS STILL VERY MUCH IN THE AIR IT'S KIND OF SAD HOW IT TAKES SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN FOR LETTING HIM TO COME TO
IT'S SUCH AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE TO FEEL EVERYONE COME TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY AND STAND TOGETHER HOUSES REALLY
THAT REPORT FROM DID MCMULLEN WILL ED MURRAY IS THE MAYOR OF SEATTLE HE WAS THE FIRST OPENLY GAY ELECTED MAYOR OF A MAJOR AMERICAN CITY SAYS THAT IN SPITE OF THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE ON GAY RIGHTS IN HIS COUNTRY THERE IS A LOT MORE TO DO SWEET
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEA AND PREJUDICE I IT IS HERE
WHAT ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF ALL OF US GROW UP BUT AT THEM SHOOT MATRON GIVE PEOPLE WE CONSIDERED NORMAL
WHY I THINK THAT WORD COMES FROM WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MOST POWERFUL FOR STANDING IN THE WAY OF EQUAL RIGHTS HEY
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR COUNTRY A MIND THOUGH THE PEOPLE KNOW HE'D CUPID CUE PERSON LIKELY TO NOT BE PREJUDICE THE OTHER THING THAT STANDS IN OUR WAY IN THE STATES THERE'S A VERY VERY DEVICE OF POLITICS IN THE SENSE THAT I THINK THAT WE CREDIBLY WE HAVE THE ENTERED A PERIOD WHERE THE POLITICS OF PUSH OR DENIGRATION IN THE DENIGRATION OF PEOPLE BY THE GROUPS AS THEY DO BELONG TO HAS REACHED SUCH A POINT THAT
I AM DON HASN'T POLITICS ALWAYS DINNER PRETTY DIRTY BUSINESS IN MANY CASES AT WE TAKE UP POLITICS AS A CONTACT SPORT BUT WE REALLY ARE GOING TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL WE WERE BECOMING VERY POLARISED WE TEND TO LIVE GEOGRAPHICALLY IN AREAS THAT MATTER POLITICS YOU KNOW HIM IN MANY WAYS IN AIN'T A HEAT TO MAKE COMPARISONS BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT IN SOME WAYS REMINDS ME I ATE IN THE SEVENTIES AND LIVED IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND
SEE IN A COUNTRY WHERE FOLKS WE DON'T GOT IT SHOULD COME OFF AND WE'VE GOT THE COAST FOLKS WE'VE GOT A TOTAL LIKE THAT IN THE CELL FOR THE MIDWEST IN MY STATE
SO IF YOU'RE A GAY MAN OR WOMAN LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY WHAT DO YOU SEE MOST HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT YOUR LIVES I THINK MOST OF US GOING TO GET SOME ON THE MIRROR SHELL BUT I'M ALSO A GAY PERSON I THINK MOST OF US GO AND WE LIVE OUR LIVES AND WE ENJOY ALLIES BUT
IS THERE A GENUINE SEE WILL BE YOUNG EMAIL ON MY OWN VIDEO EXPERIENCED AND THAT HOPE BOTH ATTEMPTED COUP BASHING ON THE STREET OF MY NEIGHBOURHOOD ANY CONTINUES UNTIL YOU FOR THIS COUNTRY TO DO SO THERE IS ALWAYS THAT FEAR AND BY THE WAY THERE SOME INCREDIBLE COUNTRY LIVE AS WELL AS THE WAY AND SO MANY USES BUT WE WERE WORKING TO A VERY DIFFICULT TIME WHEN IT COMES TO SHOES LIKE THIS IN REALLY
ORIENTATION AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION RIGHT AT THE HEART OF THIS WITH ME AND HER STRUGGLE AROUND THE USUAL PLACE IT WAS THE TWO IRRESPECTIVE NURSERY DIDN'T RELAY END UP AS THE TWO INTERSECT IS TRUE ITERATIVE SO THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER BY ANY MEANS BUT I DID NOT OVER
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN STOP JUST BY DOING WHAT PETER'S MEMORY MANY THANKS FOR TALKING TO US THE TIME IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT IF WE VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. EVERY REGION CROUP AND RECIPIENT OF E.U. FUNDING IN THIS COUNTRY WOULD STILL GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS THE PLEDGE FROM THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN TODAY WHICH IS ALSO HIGHLIGHTING E.U. OFFICIALS EXPENSES CLAIMS
WE'RE JOINED FROM WESTMINSTER BY THE EMPLOYMENT MINISTER PRETTY PATEL WHO IS CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. GOOD MORNING IT'S ON WHAT A THOROUGH T. DO YOU MAKE THIS PROMISE WE'VE BEEN CLEAR THAT OVERALL IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE WE CAN TAKE BACK CONTROL OF BRITISH TAXPAYERS' MONEY AND PROTECT THE FUND HIM FROM THOSE WHO NOW GET MONEY FROM THE E.U. AND IMPORTANTLY IMPROVE FUND EMEKA MECHANISM SO THAT MONEY SAVED
GO TO THE FRONT LINE AND OF COURSE AT THIS COMES FROM THE MONEY THAT'S BRITISH TAXPAYERS SEND OVER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION AS PART OF A SUBSCRIPTION I'M GOING IF YOU DARE BECAUSE THE QUESTION I ASKED YOU WAS NOT ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTION WAS IT WAS ON WHAT AUTHORITY YOU AS THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN MAKE THIS PROMISE IT IS
GOVERNMENTS WHO MAKE DECISIONS ON SPENDING WELL WE ARE SAYING THAT OBVIOUSLY GOVERNMENTS CAN CHOOSE AFTER THE REFERENDUM IN TERMS OF HOW IT WOULD SPEND THE MONEY IF WE TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR MONEY FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION
WE HAVE BEEN ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH MONEY TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO NOW GETS FUNDING FROM THE E.U. INCLUDING UNIVERSITY SCIENTISTS FARMERS REGIONAL FUNDS WOULD CONTINUE TO GETS MONEY ONE ENSURING THAT THAT COULD BE SPENT ON OUR PRIORITY IT IS IT'S A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES AND INDEED GOVERNMENTS AS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE MAKE THOSE SPENDING DECISIONS AND THE GOVERNMENT THAT YOU ARE PART OF US LED BY DAVID CAMERON IF HE HAS REPLACED IT COULD BE BY GEORGE OSBORNE
THEY ARE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE E.U. ARGUMENT FROM YOU AND THEY MIGHT MAKE VERY DIFFERENT DECISIONS IN THE EVENT OF A BRECHT'S THE REALITY I THINK DURING THIS CAMPAIGN THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT WE PAY MONEY THAT WE ARE GIVING MONEY TO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OF COURSE WHEN WE DO GET MONEY BACK IT COMES BACK WITH CONTROLS IT COMES BACK WITH US AS GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT NOT BEING ABLE TO DECIDE HOW TO PRIORITISE THAT MONEY WHAT WE CAN SPEND IT ON IT'S A EUROPEAN UNION THAT DICTATES HOW WE SPEND THAT MONEY
WE ARE CLEARLY SAYING THAT IF WE TAKE BACK CONTROL OFF THAT MONEY WE CAN SPEND IT ON A RANGE OF OUR PRIORITIES THE ONES THAT I'VE LISTED TODAY BUT ON TOP OF THAT WE CAN CONTINGENT CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE N.H.S. WE CAN SCRAP
V.A.T. ON FUEL WHICH OF COURSE AFFECTS PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES AND THESE ARE THE PRIORITIES THAT QUITE FRANKLY MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AND WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE TO OUR COUNTRY AND ALSO TO THE BRITISH PUBLIC LET'S TRY AND PUT SOME NUMBERS AGAINST THOSE THINGS THAT YOU SAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO SPEND MONEY ON SO IF YOU LOOK AT AT THE MONEY WE WOULD HAVE AVAILABLE AND THIS IS ASSUMING THAT THERE IS NO ECONOMIC HIT AND THAT THE MONEY WAS STILL AVAILABLE IN THE EVENT OF BRICKS
IF YOU SUBTRACT THE REBATE FROM UP A REBATE FROM A GROSS CONTRIBUTION AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND PRIVATE SECTOR RECEIPTS THAT YOU SAY YOU WOULD STILL HONOUR IN THE EVENT OF THAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE MILLION POUNDS A WEEK
YOU THE OR CAMPAIGN OF SAID WOULD SPEND ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A WEEK ON THE N.H.S. IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S ALL WE HAVE SAID EXACTLY THAT THAT WE WOULD SPEND ONE HUNDRED RIGHT O.K. SO THAT MEANS SIXTY MILLION POUND SO HOW WOULD YOU HOW WOULD YOU SPEND THAT SIXTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK LET'S LET'S BE CLEAR ON NET CONTRIBUTION TO THE E.U. BUDGET IS TEN A BID TEN SORRY O.K. YOU'VE MADE THAT POINT I'M ASKING TO BE I'M ASKING YOU TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT REMAINING
SIXTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK THAT IS LEFT OVER AFTER YOU'VE SUBTRACTED ANYTHING REAL THE REAL MONEY THAT WOULD BE LEFT OVER IF THERE IS NO ECONOMIC IT WHAT WOULD YOU SPEND IT ON WELL WE HAVE SAID THAT A PLEDGE TO THE N.H.S. IS CLEAR BUT ALSO CREATE FUEL AS WELL HOW MUCH WE CAN SPEND OUR MONEY ON PRIORITISING
OR CUTTING BACK V.A.T. HOW MUCH WOULD THAT ONE IT'S A SEVEN BILLION TO WEIGHTY TWENTY AND THESE ARE THE COMMITMENTS WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR THAT WE CAN MAKE AND OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE COVERED BY OUR NET CONTRIBUTION WHEN THAT MONEY COMES OUT OF THAT SIXTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK HOW MUCH WOULD YOU SPEND ON THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT YOUR CAMPAIGN HAS TALKED ABOUT WHICH INCLUDES SCHOOL PLACES NEW ROADS
V.A.T. ON FUEL WHICH YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CUTTING JOHN REDWOOD IS TALKED ABOUT TAX CUTS WE HAVE NOT LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED WE HAVE NOT SAID THAT WE WOULD SPEND MONEY ON THOSE ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE LISTED WE HAVE SAID THAT WE WOULD SPEND BRITISH TAXPAYERS' MONEY ON A RANGE OF PRIORITIES INCLUDING THE N.H.S. AND IN PARTICULAR AS WELL ON V.A.T. ON FUEL SO THOSE ARE THE TWO AREAS LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS THESE ARE THE TWO AREAS THAT WE HAVE SAID WE WOULD SPEND THAT MONEY ON RIGHT SO THOSE ARE THE ONLY
TWO THINGS YOU WOULD SPEND A VOTE COMMITMENTS THAT WE HAVE MADE AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO AREAS FOLK LEAVE HAVE ALSO PROMISED TO BUILD ROADS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IN ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE OR YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT PRIMARY SCHOOL PLACES THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY ONE MILLION POUNDS THIS IS AN ANNUAL FIGURE NEEDED TO FUND THE ADDITIONAL SCHOOL PLACES IS JUST OVER A WEEK'S WORTH OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE E.U. WELL OF COURSE THOSE OF THE OPTIONS AND CHOICES FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY TO MAKE ALTHOUGH YOU COMMITTING WI HER MONK YOU WOULD SAVE ON SCHOOL PLACES
SO ON SCHOOL PLACES LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS I HAVE SPOKEN IN FACT THAT LEAF HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE PRESSURES OF MIGRATION AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT HAS ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND ON SCHOOL PLACE WHAT WOULD YOU SPEND OUT WELL YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE OPTIONS ON THE CHOICES FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY TO MAKE BUT LET ME BE VERY CLEAR RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MADE TWO COMMITMENTS ONE IS ON THE N.H.S. AND SAFEGUARD IN THAT INVESTMENT IN THE N.H.S. GOING FOR AUDEN ALSO CUT IN V.A.T. ON FUEL WHICH OF COURSE HELPS THE FAMILIES OF PEOPLE ON THE LOWEST INCOMES ARE MOST
O.K. SO ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED ARE JUST BEING DANGLED IN FRONT OF VOTERS ARE THERE THERE ARE THERE ARE NO ACTUAL PROMISES TO SPEND MONEY ON THEM IF YOU WERE IN A POSITION TO BE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS IN THE EVENT OF A VOTE TO LEAVE WE ARE SAYING VERY CLEARLY THAT WHEN WE TAKE BACK CONTROL OF THE MONEY THAT WE CAN'T CENTRE THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY WILL HAVE OPTIONS AND CHOICES AS TO HOW THEY CHOOSE TO SPEND THAT MONEY AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHEN IT COMES OR FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE THE IMPACT ON THE PRESSURE ON PUBLIC SERVICES OF COURSE IT'S UP TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY TO ADDRESS MANY OF THOSE CONCERNS ONE OF THAT IS THE CASE THEN HOW CAN YOU SAY AS YOU DO IN THIS LETTER
THAT YOU WOULD ENSURE THAT UNIVERSITY SCIENTISTS FARMERS ARE REGIONAL FUNDS CULTURAL ORGANISATIONS AND OTHERS WOULD CONTINUE TO GET THE MONEY THAT THEY GET FROM THE E.U. WE'VE BEEN CLEAR THAT WE WORD WE KNOW THAT THERE'D BE MORE THAN ENOUGH MONEY TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO CURRENTLY DEBTS THAT FUNDING FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD THAT MONEY WOULD EXIST AND IT COULD STILL GO TO THOSE PRIORITIES AND LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS
WHY WOULD ANY GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY CHOOSE TO CUT THOSE AREAS OF SPENDIN WHEN THESE ARE INSTITUTIONS ORGANISATIONS PARTS OF OUR SOCIETY AND FARMERS IN PARTICULAR THAT ARE IMMENSELY IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY AS WELL YOU NEED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY WOULD DO THAT YOU WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS YOU'RE MAKING HERE ASSUMES THAT THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF MONEY ED ED OR TO OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE E.U. AT THE MOMENT WOULD BE AVAILABLE BUT THERE WOULD BE NO ECONOMIC HIT IN THE EVENT OF THE VOTE AND WELL OF COURSE
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE WOULD BE AVAILABLE WITH TAKE THAT MONEY BACK AND OF COURSE IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMICS I THINK IT'S PRETTY PESSIMISTIC THAT THE REMAIN SIDE KEEP ON TALKING DOWN OUR ECONOMY WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC HIT TO WELL OF COURSE THERE WOULD BE MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THROUGH THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TRADE WITH NEW COMPASS ORGAN COUNTRIES
AROUND THE WORLD AND JUST LISTEN TO SOME OF THE BUSINESS LEADERS LIKE ANTHONY BAMFORD JAMES DYSON WHO THEMSELVES HAVE SAID OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND THAT WE WOULD HER GREAT OPPORTUNITIES NOT JUST TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF MONEY BUT WE HAVE HAD NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO GO OUT THERE AND TRADE AND HAVE NEW ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH COUNTRIES AND ECONOMIES WHERE WE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THAT PRETTY PATEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

TO WALK AROUND THE WORK TO RE INSTALL IT TO HAVE A THE FORMATIVE AND PARTICIPATORY RELATIONSHIP AND THAT REALLY IS A STORY THAT HAS BEEN BUILDING OVER THE LAST DECADES UNTIL YOU GET TO THE PRESENT MOMENT WHERE ARTISTS AND AUDIENCES WORK TOGETHER VERY OFTEN AND COLLABORATIVE WAYS SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A DRAWING BAR WHERE PEOPLE CAN MAKE SCREEN DRAWINGS THEIR OWN SCREEN DRAWINGS WELL THAT'S FOR THE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND THE THE THE OFFER IS NOT JUST TO COME AND LOOK AND SEE
AND THINK BUT ALSO TO RESPOND SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN USE A DIGITAL SKETCH BOOKS YOU COULD ALSO JOIN A DEBATE YOU COULD BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS YOU CAN INTERACT WITH A WORK OF ART YOU COULD HEAR A PERFORMANCE YOU MIGHT EVEN BE INVOLVED IN A PERFORMANCE WHEN MOUNTED POLICEMEN WALKING TO THE GALLERY OVER THIS OPENING WEEKEND AND HOW IMPORTANT IS ALL OF THAT DO YOU THINK TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF
OF MODERN ART IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL IS IT TO TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY OF A I THINK CONTROVERSY AND INNOVATION HAVE BEEN THE D.N.A. OF CONTEMPORARY ART AND THAT THAT CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM WALES TYPIFIES THE KIND OF CONVERSATION YOU MIGHT HAVE A NEWCOMER TO TATE MODERN IS IT ART WHAT DOES IT MEAN HOW DOES IT RELATE TO TO THE LIFE I LEAD HOW DOES IT RELATE TO THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD AND YOU'VE BEEN ALREADY
VERY SUCCESSFUL IN FACT YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE MILLION VISITORS A YEAR WE HAVE FOUR TO FIVE MILLION VISITORS A YEAR AND I HOPE WITH A NEW BUILDING THE EXPERIENCE WILL BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE AND GENEROUS FOR ALL THOSE VISITORS BUT YOU BUT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE VISITOR NUMBERS THROUGH THIS I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO GO
FRANCES MORRIS DIRECTOR TATE MODERN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIRTY QUARTER TO NINE IT IS FORTY ODD YEARS SINCE STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN WAS THE SONG WILL TODAY THEY'LL BE TALKING ABOUT IT IN A COURT IN LOS ANGELES JIMMY PAGE AND ROBERT HALL OF LED ZEPPELIN WILL BE DEFENDING THE BAND AGAINST ACCUSATIONS OF PLAGIARISM ANOTHER BAND CALLED SPIRIT CLAIMS THE GUITAR OPENING WAS LIFTED FROM THEIR INSTRUMENTAL TRACK TAURUS HERE'S THE CONTENTIOUS BIT LED ZEPPELIN STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN INTO SPIRITS TAURUS
WELL PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT WASN'T IT WE THINK ANYWAY CLINTON HAIL ON HE'S THE MAN TO ASK ABOUT IT THOUGH HE'S A MUSIC HISTORIAN HE'S WRITTEN IT'S ONE FOR YOUR MONEY ONE FOR THE MONEY RATHER A BOOK ALL ABOUT THE THORNY ISSUE OF MUSIC PUBLISHING GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING SO ANYBODY LISTENING EVEN PEOPLE ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD LISTENING TO THOSE
TWO TUNES WOULD RECOGNISE THAT THEY WERE HUGELY SIMILAR WOULDN'T THEY YEAH NO ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN WE GET IN THE QUESTION OF WAS IT ACTUALLY PLAGIARISM
WELL OF COURSE THAT THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF PLAGIARISM IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE DISPUTED IN LOS ANGELES THAT THE PROBLEM FOR LED ZEPPELIN UNFORTUNATELY IS THAT THEY HAVE FORM OF THERE I'VE BEEN MANY MANY SUITS OVER SOME OF THEIR MOST FAMOUS SONGS WHOLE LOT OF LOVE
DAZED AND CONFUSED I MEAN THESE WERE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR SUITS AND THEY'VE LOST EVERY WHAT WHO WRITERS IT COST HIM A LOT
YET HE'S PROBABLY STILL GOT A FEW BOB LEFT BUT WHAT SORT OF MONEY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WELL OBVIOUSLY THE BLURRED LINES CASE WHICH WAS LAST YEAR OVER THE MARVIN GAYE REP WAS WAS FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION GOLFERS SO THERE'S
THERE'S DEFINITELY A FEW SHEKELS INVOLVED YEAH I DO LET'S HAVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND THIS IS A SORT OF WELL I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THE QUESTION IS IT ACCIDENTAL PLAGIARISM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE LET LET'S LISTEN TO THIS CLIP IT'S SAM SMITH STAY WITH ME INTO TOM PETTY'S I WON'T BACK DOWN IT'S ME AGAIN
BURN LADEN STAY ANGRY
THERE WE ARE THAT WAS THE GRAMMY SOME OF THE OTHER TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WASN'T IT AND AGAIN PRETTY OBVIOUS SIMILARITY
WELL THE EXTRAORDINARY THING ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION AND SAM SMITH I'M TOM PETTY BOTH AGREED IT WAS ACCIDENTAL BUT IS THAT THE THE FIRST THING ANYONE WHO WOULD HAVE HEARD THAT IN THE STUDIO WHEN IT WAS RECORDED WOULD HAVE SAID IS THAT SO I WON'T BACK DOWN BECAUSE I WON'T BACK DOWN WAS A HUGE HIT AND IT'S NOT THAT LONG AGO NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE SO
IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN A STUDIO YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THAT KIND OF TALK THAT WOULD HAPPEN ALL THE TIME AND I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THAT SOMEBODY DIDN'T SAY DOESN'T THAT SOUND A BIT LIKE
WELL EXACTLY SO WHAT WHY DIDN'T THEY I MEAN IT WAS WHAT'S THE THOUGHT PROCESS I MEAN CLEARLY THEY THOUGHT IT WASN'T SIMILAR ENOUGH AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE ONLY A SET NUMBER OF NOTES AND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN PLAY THESE THINGS AND I'M GUESSING THE DECISION WAS MADE NO WILL WILL RUN WITH IT I MEAN THERE'S THE SLIGHTLY IRONIC THING ABOUT THAT
IS THAT THEY SETTLED BEFORE IT WAS BECAME THE GRAMMY SONG OF THE YEAR BUT WHEN THE GRAMMY SONG OF THE YEAR WAS AWARDED TOM PETTY AND JEFF LYNNE WAS STILL MISSING FROM THE SONG CREDITS LET'S HAVE ONE MORE CLIP THEN THIS IS BLOWING OF THE WIND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT INTO PERHAPS MAYBE BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THIS BUT I'M GOING TO NO MORE OX AND BLOCK A TRADITIONAL SONG SUNG IN THIS KIT GATES ODETTA
MANY ERODES MASTER MAN
OR YOU COME HERE MAN
LOOK
WHAT DO YOU DO YOU MAKE OF THAT ONE CLINTON WELL I MEAN THE VERY DAY THAT DYLAN DEBITED THAT SONG GOES FOLK CITY PETE SEEGER POINTED OUT THAT IT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN TAKEN FROM NO MORE AUCTION BLOCK AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S A TRADITIONAL SONG IT'S AN ANTI SLAVERY SONG WRITTEN IN THE EIGHTEEN FORTIES
THERE WASN'T ANY COPYRIGHT ISSUE AND IN THOSE DAYS DYLAN MYRTLE ALMOST ALL OF HIS MELODIES CAME FROM TRADITION IT'S OVER BUT IT WAS DELIBERATE WELL YOU CAN EITHER CALL IT THAT OR YOU COULD CALL IT DELIBERATE PLAGIARISM YEAH OH LIKE DEFINITELY WAS DELIBERATE DELLA WAS STILL PERFORMING NO MORE AUCTION BLOCK AT THE TIME WELL WHAT A FASCINATING AREA BUT GREAT MUSIC ANYWAY SO THAT DOES ANYBODY CARED IF THEY GET REPEATED PROBABLY NOT
WELL IT'S IT'S A MONEY SYSTEM THE LAWYERS WILL WIN MONEY TALKS CLINTON AND THANKS A LOT YEAH JETS THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO NINE HOW CAN WE BETTER PREDICT EXTREME WEATHER SUCH AS THE MONSOON RAINS IN SOUTH ASIA A PROJECT INVOLVING SCIENTISTS FROM THE U.K. AND INDIA IS UNDER WAY THAT AIMS TO DO JUST THAT WE'RE JOINED FROM NORWICH BY THE OCEAN I'LL FOR DOCTOR BEN WHETHER HE'S ONE OF THOSE INVOLVED GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING YOU ARE GOING TO DO THIS IN AN UNUSUAL WAY
YES WELL IT'S A BIG COLLABORATIVE PROJECT BETWEEN SCIENTISTS FROM THE U.K. UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA ARE LEADING THE PROJECT FROM FROM U.K. SIDE BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH WITH THE INDIANS WHO WERE PROVIDING THEIR SHIP NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA TAKE THAT SHIP BUT ALSO TAKE SEVEN UNDERWATER ROBOTS WHICH ARE GOING TO ALLOW US TO MONITOR THE OCEAN CONDITIONS AND WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE OCEAN IS INFLUENCING THE MONSOON RAINFALL BECAUSE THE ROBOTS CAN GO DEEPER THAN THAN THAN OTHER SORTS OF MONITORING
BUT WHAT THE ROBOTS ALLOW US TO DO IS TO GET A REALLY HIGH RESOLUTION PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON UNDER THE OCEAN SURFACE AND IT'S MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF DOING THAT THAN WITH SHIPS WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNFEASIBLE TO GET THE QUANTITY OF OBSERVATIONS AND THE QUALITY OF OBSERVATIONS WE'RE GOING TO GET FROM THE SEVEN ROBOTS IN A FOUR HUNDRED COME UP WITH A LINE ACROSS THE BAY OF BENGAL USING TRADITIONAL GRAPHIC MESH METHODS SO ONCE YOU HAVE THE DATA HOW ACCURATE WILLETT ENABLE YOU TO BE BECAUSE
ROUGHLY WE KNOW WHAT TIME OF THE YEAR THE MONSOON FALLS IN WHICH GEOGRAPHIC PART OF SOUTH ASIA DON'T WE WE DO ROUGHLY ABSOLUTELY I MEAN YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT THE MONSOON IS REALLY BIG BUSINESS IN INDIA
THESE ARE OVER A BILLION PEOPLE LIVING THERE AND TWO THIRDS OF THOSE DEPEND UPON THE AGRICULTURE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY SO SMALL CHANGES IN THE ONSET DATE SMALL CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND AT THE MOMENT OUR FORECASTS ARE O.K. BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT BUT IT DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO PREDICT TO THE DAY THE MONSOON IS GOING TO START ON THIS DAY IN THIS AREA
WELL I MEAN WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT EXPECTING THAT KIND OF IMPROVEMENT STRAIGHT AWAY WHAT WE ARE
I'M HOPING TO BE ABLE TO DO IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW CHANGED IN THE OCEAN INFLUENCED MONSOON RAINFALL AND FEET THE UNDERSTANDING AND BY WORKING WITH THE INDIAN SCIENTISTS HE WILL HE WILL HAVE THE CLIMATE MODELS THAT PREDICT THE MONSOON RAINS TO IMPROVE THOSE MODELS AND HOW THEY REPRESENT THEM ON SCENE AND THEREFORE IMPROVE THOSE FORECASTS ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THE FORECAST IT'S GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE THE INDIAN ECONOMY AND THE INDIAN PEOPLE AND THAT THE TIME FRAME HOW LONG TILL YOU ABLE TO HAVE A REALLY USEFUL INFORMATION
SO THE PROJECT IS THAT HE'S GOING TO THE RITZ WE'RE STARTING WITH THE RESEARCH CAMPAIGN NOW OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON I'M ANALYSING THE RESULTS AND AS I SAY IMPROVING THOSE MODELS SO LOOKING ABOUT A FEW YEARS BUT OVER WHICH WE WILL HOPEFULLY BE IMPROVING THEIR MODELS AND THEN WE SHOULD START TO SEE SOME IMPROVEMENTS DOCTOR BEN WHETHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SIX MINUTES AND I WELL WE HAVE BEEN GETTING A SENSE OVER THE LAST WEEKS OF WHAT THE NATION THINKS ABOUT LEAVING OR STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WE GOING TO ALL POINTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM NORTH SOUTH EAST AND WEST WILL SARAH IS ABOUT AS CLOSE TO THE EUROPEAN UNION WELL AS CLOSE TO THE CONTINENT ANYWAYS YOU CAN GET SHE'S IN DOVER THIS MORNING MORNING SARAH AGAIN

OBVIOUSLY SECURITY IN CALAIS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER IS MUCH BETTER NOW THAN IT HAS BEEN DO YOU STILL HAVE PROBLEMS WITH STAIRWAYS AGENT UP WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING DRIVING
YES YOU'VE GOT TO BE VIGILANT AT ALL TIMES BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST OPPORTUNISTS AND EDDIE IF YOU CANNOT STOP YOU JUST GOTTA TRY AND KEEP THE TRUCK MOVING AT ALL TIMES AND IF YOU COULD LOOK AHEAD TO MAKE SURE
PROBLEMS JUST GOT TO GO FOR IT IF YOU STOP THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE IN TROUBLE HAVE YOU HAD PEOPLE IN YOUR TRUCK BEFORE I FED AND TRIES TO GET INTO MY TRUCK MANY TIMES BUT I'VE BEEN LUCKY NOT TO IT
HAVE THEM ON BOARD AND BRING HER BACK TO THE O.K. AND YOU WERE SAYING THAT SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES NOW WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING AND YOU CAN SEE THEM OVER THE BRIDGES AS THEY'RE TRYING TO STOP YOU THAT'S CORRECT YEAH THERE'S BEEN MANY OTHER DRIVERS THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THIS THEY WILL THROW OBJECTS FROM BRIDGES TRYING TO STOP THE TRUCK AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE IN TROUBLE WOULD PUT SETI'S ANY OBSTACLE THEY CAN FIND INTO THE ROGUE WAVE TO GET YOU TO STOP THE TRUCK AND THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE IN THE HEDGE WHY HE'S TRYING TO JUMP IN THERE BECKY TRIDENT THINGS
IT DOES IT FEEL LIKE RUNNING THE GAUNTLET
ALL THE TIME BECAUSE YOU RISK GOING TO YOUR PROM
BUT AS LONG AS YOU CAN GET TO THE DOOR COULDN'T DO THE PROCEDURE FOR A HEARTBEAT AND DOGS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THEN IT'S O.K.
BUT YOU'VE STILL GOT TO GET TO THE DOCK IT HAS IMPROVED SINCE I PUT THE FRENCH
ON THE C. R. S. ARE THERE WITH THEIR GUNS AND EVERYTHING AND I'VE MADE A SPICE FROM THE FRENCH PUBLIC
OF NO MAN'S LAND WHICH IS PATROL SO IT IS BETTER THAN IT WAS
TWO YEARS AGO AS WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT THE FIGURES FOR TRUCKERS WHO AND TRUCK COMPANIES WHO'VE BEEN FINED IN THEY'VE GONE UP A LOT IN RECENT YEARS AT THE EYE NO YOU NEITHER OF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN FIND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU WERE

BECAUSE IT WILL BE GOING BACK IN TIME ON IT AND I WILL BE GOING BACK TO THE OLD TWO FORMS AND PERMISSION TO DO THIS AND HAVING TO GET PAPERWORK STAN
THAT'S NOT YOU NO WE'VE MOVED ON TWENTY YEARS AND IT'S
COMMUNICATION AND INTERNET AND ALL THAT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
EVEN IF YOU KNOW THEY SAY WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK OUR OWN BORDERS SO ALL IT MEANS IS THE CUSTOMS AND IMMIGRATION WILL MOVE BACK INTO DOVER
