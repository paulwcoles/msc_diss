THE DECISION BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS TO MONITOR THE SALE OF PRODUCTS WHICH COULD BE USED IN EXECUTIONS BRINGS PFIZER INTO LINE WITH ALL THE OTHER FEDERALLY APPROVED MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUCH DRUGS AND LEAVES STATES WHICH CARRY OUT SUCH EXECUTIONS LITTLE OPTION BUT TO SEEK OUT OTHER UNOFFICIAL SOURCES IF THEY STILL WANT TO GET HOLD OF THOSE DRUGS IN HER STATEMENT PFIZER SAID ITS PRODUCTS WERE MEANT TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THAT IT STRONGLY OBJECTED TO THEIR USE IN EXECUTIONS

THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS CRITICISED SIR JOHN MAJOR AFTER HE ACCUSED SOME CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE Y. YOU HAVE USING FALSE FIGURES AND STOKING FEARS OF IMMIGRATION SIR JOHN MADE HIS COMMENTS IN A SPEECH AT THE OXFORD UNION LAST NIGHT BUT THE LEAF CAMPAIGN REJECTED HIS CLAIMS HAD ACCUSED THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF NAME CALLING OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ELEMER GARNI REPORTS

OF BEING RECKLESS SO JOHN ALSO ATTACKED CLAIMS MADE BY BORIS JOHNSON THE FORMER CABINET MINISTER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AND THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO THAT LEAVING THE E.U. COULD SAVE BILLIONS OF POUNDS A YEAR
THEY NEEDED TO APOLOGISE HE SAID FOR PEDDLING A DEMONSTRABLE UNTRUTH BUT BELIEVE CAMPAIGNER AND JUSTICE MINISTER DOMINIK RAB SAID HIS SIDE WAS TRYING TO HANDLE A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION RESPONSIBLY HE SAID IT WAS SOMETHING PEOPLE CARED ABOUT AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESPONSIBLE NOT TO BE TALKING ABOUT IT LET'S HAVE THE DEBATE HE SAID BUT ON SUBSTANCE NOT NAME CALLING
THE MAN WHO BOUGHT B.H.S. FROM SIR PHILIP GREEN HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THE RETAILER COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED IF IT HAD BEEN GIVEN MORE TIME DOMINIC CHAPEL TOLD NEWSNIGHT THAT B.H.S. WOULD'VE BEEN BREAKING EVEN BY SEPTEMBER NEXT YEAR AND THAT UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP THE FIRM HAD BEEN MAKING HUGE PROGRESS IS A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT ADAM PARSONS

FOR A POUND MY PEARL HAD NO RETAIL EXPERIENCE AND HAD BEEN DECLARED BANKRUPT THREE TIMES BUT HE CLAIMED TO BE A SPECIALIST IN TURNING AROUND TROUBLED COMPANIES THIRTY MONTHS LATER AND B.H.S. WAS IN ADMINISTRATION BUT MY PEARL HAS NOW TOLD THE B. B. C. HIS PLAN TO REVITALISE THE DEPARTMENT STORE CHAIN COULD HAVE WORKED AND THAT THE CRITICISM HE'S FACED IS UNJUST
HE SAYS HE WAS HIT BY BAD CHRISTMAS TRADING AND BY THE IMPACT OF AN INVESTIGATION BY THE PENSIONS REGULATOR WHICH TAINTED B.H.S. HIS REPUTATION AND HE SAYS MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET BANK LOANS AT REASONABLE RATES

AT THE TIME THEY CLAIMED THEY WERE FORCED BY A GANG AT GUNPOINT TO TRAVEL TO PERU AND COLLECT DRUGS MICHAELA MCCOLLUM WAS FREED LAST MONTH AND A NEW PERUVIAN LEGISLATION ON EARLY PRISON RELEASE BUT IT'S UNDERSTOOD SHE WILL HAVE TO REMAIN IMPROVED FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD AS PART OF HER PAROLE CONDITIONS
A VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS HAS SAID THE BODY MUST REFORM ADAPT AND CHANGE RICHARD BROOKS WAS SPEAKING AFTER STUDENTS AT NEWCASTLE AND LINCOLN VOTED TO SPLIT FROM THE UNION SAYING IT NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE VIEWS OF ITS MEMBERS THE RECENTLY ELECTED PRESIDENT AND THEY ARE BUT HERE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF ANTI CEMETERIES AND SHE DENIES THE CLAIM
POLITICIANS IN TEXAS ARKANSAS AND SEVERAL OTHER U.S. STATES HAVE VOWED TO FIGHT A GOVERNMENT DECREE WHICH SAYS TRANSGENDER STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHICH TOILETS THEY USE AT SCHOOL THE DIRECTIVE IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING BUT SCHOOLS THAT DON'T COMPLY COULD HAVE THEIR FUNDING REDUCED THE TEXAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DOWNPATRICK HAD THIS MESSAGE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO WITHHOLD FUNDING AT STALLS DO NOT FOLLOW THE POLICY WAS TEXAS
HE CAN KEEP HIS THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER WE WALNUT TO BLACKMAIL FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AN UNEXPLODED WARTIME BOMB WHICH WAS FOUND IN A SCHOOL PLAYGROUND IN BATH HAS BEEN DESTROYED THE FIVE HUNDRED POUND SHELL WAS DEACTIVATED AND TAKEN OUT OF THE CITY ON THE BACK OF A LORRY WHERE IT WAS DISPOSED OF IN A CONTROLLED EXPLOSION
THE TOUR OF SCOTLAND BY THE STEAM LOCOMOTIVE THE FLYING SCOTSMAN HAS BEEN CANCELLED NETWORK RAIL THE TRACK OPERATOR SAID IT HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CARRY OUT ASSESSMENT WORK ON SOME LINES IN TIME THE FLYING SCOTSMAN WILL STILL TRAVEL FROM YORK TO EDINBURGH WAVERLEY TODAY BUT TOMORROW'S JOURNEY ON THE NEW BORDERS RAILWAY TO TWEET BANK AND ACROSS THE FORTH BRIDGE WILL NOT GO AHEAD
SON IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK JUST LIKE ANY OTHER ELECTION CAMPAIGN OUT THERE THIS WEEKEND ALL THE BIG NAMES AND ALL THE BIG PARTIES OUT ON THE ROAD IN THEIR BATTLE BUSES ARGUING FOR THEIR SIDE IN THE REFERENDUM THE DIFFERENCE PERHAPS IS THE BIGGEST ARGUMENTS ARE WITHIN THE PARTIES OR AT LEAST WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS IAN WATTS AND JOHN MAJOR HAVIN A GO AT MICHAEL GO ET-CETERA ET-CETERA
THAT'S RIGHT GEORGE VERY INTERESTING TO THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING TODAY IS GOING TO BE A DAY LIKE NO OTHER IS SAYS THAT POLITICIANS OF ALL STRIPES ARE GOING TO BE UNITING AROUND THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN BUT MY GOODNESS HE MUST HAVE MORE IN COMMON BIZARRELY ENOUGH THERE JEREMY CORBIN IS ADDRESSING A RALLY A COUNSELLING BECAUSE SUDDENLY BRINGS BUT IF THAT WAS SOME OF HIS OWN PARTY AND CERTAINLY SIR JOHN MAJOR'S A PREVIOUS PRIME MINISTER SAID THE KIND OF THINGS WHICH THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER
JUST CAN'T QUITE SALE OR SOMETIMES A COMES CLOSE SO HE DENOUNCED BY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH MICHAEL GO VAN BORIS JOHNSON HE SAID ARE EXAGGERATING THE CASE OF COMING UP WITH FALSE FIGURES ON THE E.U. AND I SUPPOSE THAT DARKER WARNING ALY DIDN'T ASSOCIATE THEM BY NAME ON THIS WAS THAT SOME BREAKS HER TEARS WERE MORPHING INTO UKIP AND GOING TO DANGEROUS TERRITORY WHEN IT CAME TO RAISING THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION SO SOME PEOPLE SING A POLITICIAN I SPOKE TO YESTERDAY WONDERING REALLY IF WE ARE GOING TO SEE A MORE PERMANENT
SCHISM WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AFTER THIS REFERENDUM IS OUT OF THE WAY WHEN WE STAY IN THE WEATHER COME OUT THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE WAS THE BIG ISSUE IS THE REFEREE THE CAMPAIGN ITSELF BUT BUT THE BIG POLITICAL POLITICAL ISSUE GOING FORWARD IS THAT IS THAT ISN'T IT I THINK THE BOTH SIDES SEEM TO SEE THE RESULT AS POTENTIALLY QUITE CLOSE WE COULD BORIS JOHNSON AGAIN IN BRISTOL SO WE'LL GET THESE PEOPLE EFFECTIVELY LAYING UP AGAINST EACH OTHER
JUST JUST THINK ABOUT THE LAST ELECTIONS ALL THESE DEBATES ABOUT THE DEBATE'S WASN'T THERE WHETHER THE PRIME MINISTER A DEBATE AGAINST SUCH AN ARGUMENT OVER WHETHER DEBATE I DIDN'T SOME HIS OWN COPIES IN HIS OWN TUB THAT BORIS JOHNSON SAYS HE'S HAPPY TO DO IT ANY TIME THE PRIME MINISTER DOESN'T WANT WHAT HE CALLS BLUE ON BLUE ACTION SO THE QUESTION IS REALLY WHETHER
WE'LL BE ABLE TO UNITE I THINGS BUT I CAN IF YOU LIKE ALMOST A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY THAT'S BECAUSE THE LABOUR PARTY HAD ITS OWN PROBLEMS THE BEEN CRITICISM FROM INSIDE THE PARTY AS YOU KNOW OF JEREMY CORBIN THAT TO SOME EXTENT OR THERE'LL BE NO POLITICAL PRICE TO PAY FOR THIS BUT IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY BITTER WHEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR FOR EXAMPLE AN OFFICIAL AT FORT LEAVE CLOSE TO MAKE A GO OF WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER WON'T BE IN NUMBER TEN FOR EVER SO I THINK THAT WILL BE A CHALLENGE THEY WIN OR LOSE INTEREST AND WE TALK ABOUT INTERNAL DIVISIONS JEN RECORDINGS
A SPEECH ON THE Y. YOU TODAY OUT MUCH PUBLICISED LESS PUBLICISED AS HER SPEECH IS GIVING TO THE PROGRESS GROUP IS TONY BLAIR THAT'S RIGHT SET UP BY LORD MANDELSON NO LESS THE MODERNISERS IF YOU LIKE SOME COLUMN THE PLAYWRIGHT STILL AND HE WOULD NOT NORMALLY BE ATTENDING ONE OF THESE CONFERENCES AT ALL BUT SHE HAS BEEN UNDER SOME CRITICISM FOR NOT REACHING OUT INSIDE HIS OWN PARTY
FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO WIN THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION THE KIND THE MAYOR OF LONDON'S BEEN RIPPED OUT THE FINALS CRITICISMS IN A NEWSPAPER THIS MORNING SO I SUPPOSE HE'S SHOWING A BIT OF AN OLIVE BRANCH TO THE BLAIR RATES BEGGING ALONE TALKING TO THEM BUT I SUSPECT YOU ALSO BE SAYING PLEASE FOR GOODNESS' SAKE UNITE YOUR FIRE ON THE CONSERVATIVES STOP GIVING THE REST OF US A RUNNING COMMENTARY OF HIS LEADERSHIP DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT BE SEEING SOME SORT OF REALIGNMENT OF THE PARTIES
I THINK IT'S HONESTLY THIS IS TOO SOON TO SAY BUT I THINK YOU WOULD GET THIS GET A FEELING THAT PERHAPS SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE BECOMING MORE MORE MORE MORE PERMANENT I THINK HE WAS QUITE INTERESTING BUT FOR EXAMPLE
WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT PEOPLE CAN SPEAK OUT WE CAN HAVE THIS IF YOU LIKE YOUR SUSPENSION OF COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE E.U. THAT TIME AND AGAIN SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES HAVE JUST BEEN PUSHING THE ENVELOPE THAT BIT FURTHER GET ONTO THEIR TERRITORY
OF NOT JUST CRITICISING THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN RECORD FOR EXAMPLE IMMIGRATION WITHIN THE PRISM OF THE E.U. THAT ACTUALLY SAYING FOR GOODNESS' SAKE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MEET THESE SILLY TARGETS WHICH THE PRIME MINISTER SET OUT BORIS JOHNSON SAID SO MUCH ALMOST IN TERMS SO I THINK YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE ALMOST DIFFERENT POLITICAL MY UP BEEN DRAWN BUT WHETHER THOSE LINES ARE JUST GOING TO BE SHIT IN DINNER WILL BE HARD AND FAST I THINK REMAINS TO BE SEEN A LOT OF IT WILL DEPEND ON HOW WELL THE OPPOSITION COULD ACTUALLY EXPLOIT ANY OF THOSE DIVISIONS THANKS A LOT
THE TIME THIRTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH TRICKIER FOR AMERICAN STATES TO EXECUTE PEOPLE FOLLOWING A DECISION FROM THE U.S. DRUGS COMPANY PFIZER TO RESTRICT THE SUPPLY OF SOME DRUGS TO STOP THEM BEING USED IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO OUR CORRESPONDENT DAVID WILLIS IN LOS ANGELES ABOUT WHAT PFIZER SAID THEIR REASONING WAS
THERE'S A SAYING THAT DRUGS THEIR PRODUCTS WERE MEANT TO SAVE OR IMPROVE LIVES NOT THE CONTRARY WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO LAST YEAR JUSTIN WENT PFIZER ACQUIRED A COMPANY CALLED HOSS BUREAU WHICH MAKES SEVERAL DRUGS INCLUDING ABOUT BEETROOTS AND SEDATIVES WHICH HAVE BEEN USED IN EXECUTIONS NOW PARTLY IN RESPONSE TO SHAREHOLDERS OBJECTIONS IT'S BROUGHT
PFIZER HAS SAID THAT IT WILL BE RESTRICTING THE SALE OF THOSE DRUGS TO PREVENT THEM BEING MY MATES
DEATH ROW DOING THIS IT'S A ALIGNING ITSELF WITH OTHER EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND IT'S ALSO SHUTTING OFF THE LAST REMAINING FEDERALLY REGULATED SOURCE OF DRUGS OF THIS KIND IN THE U.S. BUT DOES THAT MEAN THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THE DRUGS OR JUST THAT IT WILL BE SLIGHTLY MORE
WELL IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT THE BIG DRUG COMPANIES BOTH HERE AND IN EUROPE HAVE HAD MORE IMPACT PERHAPS HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS IN OPPOSING THE DEATH PENALTY
AND LIMITING THE SUPPLY OF DRUGS OF THIS KIND THERE LAST YEAR WE SAW TWENTY EIGHT EXECUTIONS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES COMPARED TO ALMOST ONE HUNDRED BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND IT'S THOUGHT THAT MUCH OF THAT
WAS ACTUALLY DUE TO THE SHORTAGE OF LETHAL INJECTION DRUGS IT'S LEFT THERE THIRTY FOUR STATES WHERE LETHAL INJECTIONS ARE CURRENTLY CARRIED OUT SCRAMBLING TO TRY TO GET THESE DRUGS FROM OTHER SOURCES IN SOME CASES FROM OVERSEAS LAST YEAR DRUGS BEING SHIPPED TO TEXAS AND ARIZONA WERE SEIZED BY FEDERAL AGENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT APPROVED FOR IMPORT TO THE UNITED STATES
ESTATES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY COY ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR DRUGS FROM SO THE LEGAL CHALLENGES HAVE MULTIPLIED AS LAWYERS FOR CONDEMNED MATES SEEK TO FIND OUT WHICH DRUGS ARE ACTUALLY BEING USED AND OF COURSE IF THE PROCESS IS BEING IMPLEMENTED HUMANELY
THEY WERE WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FORTY SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD ARE ON THE MOVE FOR VARIOUS REASONS MOSTLY WAR AND POVERTY AND WE ARE TELLING SOME OF THEIR STORIES AS PART OF THE B.B.C.'S WORLD ON THE MOVE DAY ON MONDAY
FOR GENERATIONS THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN THE DESTINATION FOR MANY LATIN AMERICANS IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE POLITICIANS LIKE DONALD TRUMP ACCUSE THEM OF BRINGING CRIMOND STEALING JOBS MOST OF THEM HAVE HAD LITTLE FORMAL EDUCATION WHEN THEY CROSS THE BORDER OFTEN ILLEGALLY ON THEY'VE BEEN LEADING DESPERATELY POOR LIVES IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES
BUT IN MIAMI A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MIGRATIONS HAPPEN HAS BECOME A MAGNET FOR RICHER LATIN AMERICANS ARRIVING THERE WITH WORK PERMITS AND UNIVERSITY DEGREES AND GOOD SALARIES AND FAR FROM BEING SEEN AS AN UNWANTED DRAIN ON THE CITY THEY ARE BECOMING THE MOVERS AND SHAKERS OF AN INCREASINGLY HISPANIC AREA OR MIAMI CORRESPONDENT LOUISE FAILURE A DOG HAS THIS REPORT
MIAMI IS A NICKNAME THE CAPITAL OF LATIN AMERICA FOR NOTHING JUST LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF THESE WELL DRESSED LATIN OR PARENTS WATCHING THEIR CHILDREN PLAY FOOTBALL

HE GIVES YOU DOUBT ME ARNIE IS FOR ME THE PERFECT MELTING PART OF AIRY CULTURE IN SOUTH AMERICA
MY STORY IS SHARED BY MANY RECENT MIDDLE CLASS MIGRANTS FROM LATIN AMERICA ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR I'D FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY IN L.A. SPANISH AS THE BACKGROUND NOISE THE WAITER SPEAK AT THE RESTAURANT SORT OF PEOPLE CUTTING YOUR GRASS FOR DOING YOUR SPEECH
IN MIAMI THE PEOPLE THAT OWN THE RESTAURANTS ON THE CABLES ON THE GROUSE ON THE TREAT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT SPEAK SPANISH THE PURCHASING POWER OF LATIN AMERICA HERE IN FLORIDA IS NOW PUT AT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION
LATIN AMERICAN ON BUSINESSES IN THIS STATE NOW EMPLOY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE
WALKING THROUGH THE WESTERN AREA OF MIAMI AND PASSING LUXURY LOOKING HOMES WITH LARGE MANICURED LAWNS SWIMMING POOL

EITHER YOU AND FAST GROWING HOLD THE FRONT
THAT WAS LOUIS REPORTING FROM MIAMI IS PART OF OUR WORLD ON THE MOVE SERIES THE TIME NOW TWENTY PAST SEVEN WHAT A VICTORY IT WAS YESTERDAY FOR JOHN PLAT WE HAD HIM ON THE PROGRAMME YESTERDAY MORNING TELLING US WHY HE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE HIS KIDS ON HOLIDAY
IN TERM TIME EVEN IF THEY MISSED A BIT OF SCHOOL AND LATER IN THE DAY THE HIGH COURT BACKED HIM AND FOR ENGLISH SCHOOLS ESSENTIALLY TOLD US THAT WELL WE COULD ALL TAKE OUR CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL FOR THE SAME REASON THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT PLEASED BUT THEY WOULDN'T COME ON TO TALK ABOUT IT TO HER THIS MORNING BUT NICK DEAKIN IS THE SHADOW SCHOOLS MINISTER AND IS ON THE LINE A GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE RULING
WELL IT'S FURTHER CHAOS THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION THIS IS THE SORT OF ISSUE THEY SHOULD BE GETTING RIGHT RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON TRYING TO MAKE ALL SCHOOLS ACADEMIES WHETHER THEY'RE GOOD OR OUTSTANDING AND WHAT DOES GET HIM RIGHT LOOK LIKE THEM TO YOU WELL YOU KNOW THIS PROBLEM WAS CREATED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHEN THE GOVERNMENT THEN CHANGE THE RULES AND TOOK AWAY THE DISCRETION THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO HER TEACHER
TO APPROPRIATE LAY APPLY POLICIES IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES SO SINCE THEN THE NUMBER OF FIXED PENALTY NOTICES HAVE GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND WHAT WE NOW HAVE IT'S HER JUDGEMENT THAT GIVES US THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS REALLY LEAVES HAD SOME PARENTS UNCLEAR WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK
WELL I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SORT OUT THE PROBLEM THE GOVERNMENT'S CREATE HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT YOU THINK THEY'D MESSED UP LESS ACCEPT THAT BUT WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE SO IF YOU GO BACK TO THOSE REGULATIONS THAT YOU MENTIONED THEM THE TWO THOUSAND SIX REGULATIONS THEN AHEAD COULD SAY YES YOU CAN GO FOR A FAMILY HOLIDAY
IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES IS THAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE PLACE WE SHOULD BE BACK INTO I MEAN IF I THINK SAYS EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL IS THE BEST THING THAT A CHILD CAN HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ATTENDANCE OF ACHIEVEMENT
HEADS NO THAT'S AND PARENTS KNOW THAT THE THE THE RULES APPLYING ALL THE OTHER EYE SUPPLYING UP TO TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MEANT THAT OUR HEADS COULD USE THEIR DISCRETION IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU THINK THAT WAS WELL THAT WAS WORKING EFFECTIVELY WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS IF IT AIN'T BROKE WHY FIX IT WHY DID THE GOVERNMENT IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT CHANGE THE RULES AND CREATE THE TENSIONS THAT WE'VE SAME BETWEEN PARENTS AND HER TEACHERS WHICH WAS NOT HELPFUL
ANYBODY THAT'S ENDED UP IN HER JUDGEMENT YESTERDAY WHICH REALLY IS THE WORST OF ALL WHO WHAT MICHAEL GO SAID BEN AND TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ACTUALLY SAID JUST BEFORE IT CHANGED THE RULES WE NEED TO DO MORE TO DISCOURAGE HOLIDAYS TAKEN DURING TERM TIME THE RATE OF THESE ABSENCES IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS IS DOUBLE THAT IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS NOW YOU COULD SEE WHAT WAS MOTIVATING HIM BUT YOU'RE SAYING IN SPITE OF THAT MOTIVATION HE WAS WRONG TO DO IT
I THINK IT WAS A FOOLISH MOVE I THINK IT'S LED TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY WE HAD A DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT BASED ON A PETITION YOU KNOW WHICH WAS VERY HEAVILY SUPPORTED BY PEOPLE UP AND DOWN THE LAND BACK IN OCTOBER WHEN I MADE IT CLEAR IN THAT DEBATE AND SUPPORTED BY A LOT OF M.P.S CROSS PARTY THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AGAIN BEFORE WE GOT INTO HER
SILLY SITUATION AND THAT'S WHERE WE'VE GOT TO BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS FOCUSING ON THE WRONG THINGS SYSTEM THEY'VE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION IS INCREASINGLY A BASKET CASE IN NOT DOING THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO PARENTS AND SCHOOL COMMUNITY I THINK IT MATTERS TO THEM IDEOLOGICAL SIDE IN TROUBLE IF THEY COME UP WITH A SET OF
POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE LAW NOW YOU'RE SAYING WHAT WE SHOULD BE GOING BACK TO IS THAT PRE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SYSTEM WHERE HEAD TEACHERS HAD DISCRETION THAT'S WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I'M SAYING THAT THAT SYSTEM SEEMED TO BE WORKING PRETTY EFFECTIVELY AND ALL THE EVIDENCE AT THAT TIME DEMONSTRATE IT WAS WORKING PRETTY EFFECTIVELY
AND THE CHANGE THEN AS CREATED THE PROBLEMS THAT WE NOW HAVE THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS DID PRODUCE SOME VERY GOOD GUIDANCE WHICH WAS VERY HELPFUL TO EVERYBODY BUT REALLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE TO GET THIS RIGHT AND THEY'VE HAD LONG ENOUGH TO GET IT RIGHT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT'S A REAL DIFFICULTY
NOW WE'VE GOT A JUDGEMENT WHICH ACTUALLY IS NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF PARENTS NOT IN THE TRENCHES THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY IS NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF CHILDREN SO THE GOVERNMENT REALLY NEEDS TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER NICK THEY CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THIS MORNING AND AS I SAY WE ASK THE GOVERNMENT TO COME AND TALK AS WELL THEY WOULDN'T BUT WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM NEIL CARMICHAEL THE CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAVE TEN PAST

FUNDAMENTALLY WE THINK THAT MONEY MONEY ABILITY SOME REALLY CONCERNING THINK IN THE PAST SHE'S TALKED ABOUT BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY IS BEING A ZIONIST OUTPOST BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF ITS JEWISH SOCIETY AND SHE'S TALKED ABOUT DESIGNERS LEAD MEDIA OUTLETS IN AN EVENT THAT SHE ATTENDED IN OFFICIAL CRUSTY AS ONLY WORKS N.U.S. BLACK STUDENTS OFFICER AND IN THAT EVENT AS WELL SEE CONDONED VIOLENT RESISTANCE AGAINST ISRAELI CITIZENS IN THE ISRAEL PALESTINE CONFLICT
AND WE THINK THAT REALLY CREATES AN UNWELCOMING ENVIRONMENT FORGERY STUDENTS AND IN THE N.U.S. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL AND IT IS SPECIFICALLY THEN THE IMPACT OF HER PRESIDENCY ON JEWISH STUDENTS THAT CONCERNS YOU THAT'S YOUR PRINCIPAL WORRY THAT'S THE PRINCIPAL REASON WHY YOU THINK CAMBRIDGE SHOULD LEAK THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT SORT OF FLIGHT UP FOR US IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT KIND OF AND ONE OF THE THINGS WITH THE N.U.S. IS THAT STUDENTS ARE LARGELY QUITE APATHETIC TOWARDS IT
PERSONALLY I DIDN'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT IT NECESSARILY UNTIL THE SELECTION AND THEN I LOOKED INTO IT MORE AND IT'S NOT JUST MALE IT IS ACTUALLY KIND OF THERE ARE MORE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS IN THE ORGANISATION AS A WHOLE SO IN FEBRUARY THEY'RE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE VOTED TO GET RID OF THE PERMANENT LEADERSHIP PLACE RESERVED FOR A JEWISH STUDENT ON THE ANTI RACISM ANTI FASCISM CAMPAIGN AND ALSO AT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE IN IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR THERE WERE SPEECHES THAT WERE APPLAUDED AND A CHEERED MADE AGAINST SUPPORTING COMMEMORATING HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY AND THAT KIND OF CLIMATE ISN'T REALLY WELCOMING AT ALL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S TURN TO RICHARD BROOKS WHO IS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL NEWS STUDENTS AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU SAY TO WHAT YOU'VE JUST HEARD I THINK WHAT I'D SAY IS THAT THE STUDENT MOVEMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MORE THAN JUST ABOUT ONE STUDENT LEADER OR SYMBOL IT'S SIMPLE INDIVIDUALS AND ACTUALLY THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT JEWISH STUDENTS HAVE RAISED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS OR MONTHS AND EITHER VICE PRESIDENT DOES HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER NATIONAL OFFICERS WITHIN THE NATIONAL STUDENTS HAVE BEEN GOING IN SPEAKING TO THEM THE THING THAT THEY HAVE SAID CLEARLY IS THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY
WANT THE DIRECTION THAT THE NASH IS TAKING TO CONTINUE IN THAT DIRECTION AND WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID TO THOSE STUDENTS AS I SAY TO STUDENT CHINS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING WHEN YOU GET INVOLVED IN IT AND IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE DEMOCRACY OF SOMETHING IN A DEMOCRATIC AND PLURALISTIC SYSTEM YOU GET INVOLVED BUT WHAT THEY SAY IS THAT I SHOULD NOT THAT DEMOCRATIC BECAUSE OF THE THE BOSS THE PRESIDENT INCLUDING THIS NEW PRESIDENT WHO IS SO CONTROVERSIAL IS ACTUALLY CHOSEN BY
DELEGATES NOT CHOSEN ONE STUDENT ONE VOTE ONE OR JUST HAVE THAT THE REASON WHY WE DO IT THE WAY THAT WE DO RIGHT NOW IS THE FACT THAT STUDENT UNIONS ARE MEMBERS AND THEY ALL SEND ELECTED DELEGATES LET BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS EVERY SINGLE YES THEY REPRESENT STUDENTS WHY NOT ALLOW ALL STUDENTS TO VOTE AND THEN MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T GET EXTREMIST CANDIDATES WINNING
WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING AND I WAS ELECTED ON A MONDAY OFF THIS LAST YEAR HAVING A DEMOCRATIC REVIEW OF THEM DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURES SO IT'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT CONSIDER IT'S ONE OF THINGS WE ARE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING UP BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS HAVE SAID THAT BUT ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE ONE STUDENT ONE VOTE IS THE ANSWER FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I THINK JEANS ARE MEMBERS AND WE USE THEM TO REPRESENT STUDENTS IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SYSTEM I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK IT WOULD BE ANY MORE REPRESENTATIVE
HOWEVER OBVIOUSLY IT WOULDN'T REPRESENT TO DO WOULDN'T IT WELL WE'VE GOT AS YOU WERE OUT EVERYONE TO VOTE THEN EVERYONE WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO TO TO CHOOSE SOMEONE AND I ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BUT THE PROBLEM THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THAT STRUCTURE WOULD ACTUALLY MEAN THAT FOR INSTANCE FURTHER EDUCATION STRING SHE MEANS WHICH ARE THE MAJORITY OF OUR MEMBERSHIP MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE BECAUSE ACTUALLY IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ONLINE VOTE AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT BUT HANG ON YOU HAVE LARGE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WHO COULDN'T GET ONLINE TO VOTE NO WHAT WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD A ONE STRING ONE VOTES
EVERY SINGLE INCH IN THE COUNTRY WOULD BE I HAVE TO HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF WAY IT ONLINE PLATFORM WHICH SUCH INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO DO A FISH GENE SCENES DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE THAT SO THEREFORE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THE OTHER AND YOU KNOW WHEN THE MORE SERIOUS COMPLAINT THAT WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM JACK MOVEMENT IS ABOUT WHAT HE REGARDS AND WHAT IT'S QUITE A FEW JEWISH STUDENTS SHOULD REGARD AS ANTI CEMETERIES AND RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE N.U.S.
AND THESE REMARKS ABOUT BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY WERE BIZARRE TO PUT IT MILDLY WEREN'T THEY THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM IS SOMETHING OF A ZIONIST OUTPOST IN BRITISH HIGHER EDUCATION IS IT REASONABLE THAT THE N.U.S. IS RUN BY SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES
I DON'T NECESSARILY WHAT I ABSOLUTELY AGREE IF THOSE COMMENTS I THINK NO I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU DO BUT IS IT REASONABLE THAT THE ORGANISATION IS RUN THIS IS AN ORGANISATION TO REPRESENT ALL STUDENTS IS RUN BY SOMEONE WHO THINKS THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM IS A ZIONIST OUTPOST WHAT I THINK THIS COMES DOWN TO A FUNDAMENTAL POINT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE BELIEVE N.U.S. OPERATES SO WE HAVE JUST HEARD THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT U.S. ISN'T DEMOCRATIC I PERSONALLY DID NOT VOTE FOR THE NEW PRESIDENT
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM A NUMBER OF AND THE MAJORITY OF ELECTED STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES VOTED FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT SO HAVE AN OPEN FORM POLICIES ALL AROUND THE PLAYERS AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE NOT ABLE TO SPEAK AT UNIVERSITIES AND YET YOU HAVE AT THE TOP OF THE N.U.S. SOMEONE WHOSE VIEWS ARE SO OFFENSIVE TO LARGE NUMBERS OF STEW'S NOT JUST JEWISH STUDENTS I WAS AS WELL
SO I'LL TAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS FIRSTLY MOPE UP FROM POLICIES ALL OVER PLACE SIMPLY ISN'T TRADE WE HAVE SIX ORGANISATIONS WHO ARE FACETS THE RACIST ORGANISATIONS THAT CAME OUT OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES INCLUDING THE ENGLISH DEFENCE LEAGUE AND HIS BITS THAT ARE PART OF MY PLATFORM POLICY THAT IS IT INDIVIDUAL STREAM TUNES OF COURSE
THE RIGHT POLICY SOME HAVE THEM SOMETIMES AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO PEOPLE LIKE LIKE PETER TATCHELL AND PEOPLE LIKE GERMAINE GREER NOT ABLE TO SPEAK AT UNIVERSITY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHOSE VIEWS US OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM SO PETER TATCHELL AND JEMAINE GRAHAM WERE NOT THEY PLATFORMS AND THERE IS THE FIRST THING I'D SAY THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY IT'S GOING TO SET AND THEY WERE BOTH OF THEM NOT ABLE TO SPEAK WEREN'T THEY HAD AT LEAST ONE EVENT WHERE THEY WERE MEANT TO BE SPEAKING I WAS ON TELEVISION LAST WEEK AND WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION LIVE ON AIR AND THE THING THAT WE SET
WHAT'S THAT INDIVIDUAL IS FIRSTLY ABSOLUTELY HAVE THEIR OWN RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR INCISIONS THAT IS NOT U.S. DECISION STREAM TUNES ARE AUTONOMOUS SO THAT IS FOR THOSE TO DECIDE BUT THAT'S A LOT ISN'T IT EXCEPT YOUR POINT ABOUT THE PROCEDURE NO WHEN THE OLDNESS IS THAT YOU'VE THEN GOT AT THE TOP OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS SOMEONE WHOSE VIEWS ARE SO EXTREME
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE'S VIEWS ARE EXTREME OR NOT I THINK THAT THE POINT IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF LEGITIMATE CONCERNS BUT YOU'RE A STUDENT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO JEWISH STUDENTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS THEY DO NOT AGREE OF THE COMMONS THAT THE MATE NEITHER DO I. AS I'VE SAID BEFORE I DON'T THINK THEY NECESSARILY THE SAME POINT IN TERMS OF N.U.S. DIS VARIATION IF YOU DISAGREE OF THE POLITICAL DIRECTION OF A NATIONAL ORGANISATION
FUNDAMENTALLY AS I'VE SAID THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC VIEW ANYWAY AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER AVENUES TO CHANGE THAT DIRECTION YOU DO THAT BY GETTING INVOLVED SO I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS I EMPATHISE WITH THEM WHAT I'M SAYING TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TUNES UP DOWN THE COUNTRY IS THAT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING A DIFFERENT FORM OF LEADERSHIP OR SOMETHING ELSE YOU GET INVOLVED IN THE NATIONAL ORGANISATION
RICHARD BROOKS VICE PRESIDENT VICE PRESIDENT NATIONAL NEWS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY TWO EIGHT TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS A LOT OF SCORN BEING POURED ON THE LATEST INTERVENTION IN THE REFERENDUM DEBATE BY THE I.M.F. THE MAIL SAYS THAT CHRIS CHRISTINE LA GARDE HAVE FOR IT IS SHE SHOULD MIND HER OWN BUSINESS AFTER SHE SAID THE CONSEQUENCES OF BRECHT'S IT RANGED FROM PRETTY BAD TO VERY VERY BAD
IT ACCUSES HER OF POLITICISING THE INDEPENDENT BODY THAT SHE LEADS AND OF INTERFERING IN NATIONAL POLITICS THE TELEGRAPH SO SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO BULLY BRITISH VOTERS CALLS THE CALLS THE I.M.F. PRONOUNCEMENTS IRRITATING LECTURES FINANCIAL TIMES WEIGHS UP THE STATE OF THE E.U. DEBATE AND SAYS THE REMAIN SIDE HAS AN UNASSAILABLE POSITION ON THE ISSUE OF THE ECONOMY BUT IT SAYS LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAD THE PASSION AND THEY'RE LIKE A DEFAULTER IMMIGRATION TO THE MOVEMENT OF WORKERS ISSUES ITSELF HAVE RESONANCE WITH VOTERS THE GUARDIAN COMPARES GOVERNMENT TACTICS
SO THOSE ARE FIRST WORLD WAR GENERAL SOFTEN UP THE ENEMY WITH A CONSTANT AND FEROCIOUS POUNDING ON THE ECONOMY IT SAYS HE'S HAVING A LIMITED EFFECT BUT THE GOVERNMENT HOPES THE WAR OF ATTRITION CAN ULTIMATELY PAY OFF THE SUN SAYS IT'LL BE A RELIEF IN THE FINAL SIX WEEKS BEFORE THE REFERENDUM WAS SPENT ON INTELLIGENT HONEST DEBATE
THE TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH A PUBLIC APOLOGY FROM THE NEW HEAD OF THE R.S.P.C.A. JEREMY COOPER SAYS HE WAS ADDRESSING A LITANY OF ERRORS THAT HAVE SEEN THE ANIMAL CHARITIES POPULARITY PLUNGED SUCH AS AGGRESSIVE PROSECUTIONS OVER HUNTING AND BADGER CULLING MY COOPER ADMITS THE ORGANISATION BECOME OVERTLY POLITICAL SAYS IT HAS TO AVOID REPEATING ITS MISTAKES
THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE ARTIST P.A.S R.S.P.C.A.

THE GUARDIAN SAYS GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN TATTERS THE SUN THE RULING A LANDMARK AND INTERPRETED SINCE PERMISSION FOR CHILDREN TO HAVE UP TO NINETEEN DAYS HOLIDAY BUT IT QUOTES AND EDUCATION LAW SPECIALIST IS S. IT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MEAN EVERY PARENT CAN TAKE THEIR CHILD OUT WHEN THEY LIKE JUST THAT HEAD TEACHERS WILL HAVE TO TAKE A MORE CONSIDERED APPROACH TO EACH CASE THE STUDY OF HISTORY DOES NOT ALWAYS MARCH HAND IN HAND WITH A CUTTING EDGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT THAT IS WHAT THE TIMES SAYS BUT IT NOTES THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS FOR BOTH
BECAUSE THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF ARCHAEOLOGISTS APPARENTLY IN THIS COUNTRY THEY HAD OF HISTORIC ENGLAND DUNCAN WILSON HAS SAID H. S. TWO AND CROSSRAIL
COULD BE DELAYED BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH EXPERTS TO DEAL WITH THE ARTEFACT UNCOVERED DURING THE DIGGING HE WANTED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ARCHAEOLOGISTS THE TIMES SAYS IT'S TIME FOR THE PRESS AND TO SHAKE OFF ITS BEARDED IMAGE YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU OH IT SAYS EIGHTEEN MINUTES EIGHT TIME NOW TO HEAR FROM JIM AND HIS WEEKLY MEET THE AUTHOR INTERVIEW THIS WEEK A RETURN TO REAL LIFE VICTORIAN CRIME FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE SUSPICIONS OF MISTER WHICHER
SUMMER SCALE IS AT HOME WITH TRUE CRIME THIS SUSPICIONS OF MY WHICH WAS A BESTSELLER BASED ON A VICTORIAN MYSTERY TOLD WITH METICULOUS RELISH SHOULDN'T ATMOSPHERE AND HER NEW BOOK THE WICKED BOY IS BACK ON THAT SIN TERRITORY
KATE SOME SKILL WHAT ATTRACTED YOU ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR STORY WHICH BEGINS WITH B.
REPORT OF A DREADFUL CRIME THE MOTHER MURDERED BY APPARENTLY HER TWO SONS
WELL IT WAS A VERY SHOCKING AND IMMEDIATELY ARRESTING STORY TO ME WHEN I READ IT IN AN OLD PAPER COS THESE TWO BOYS WERE AGED TWELVE AND THIRTEEN THERE WAS NO
MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME AND THEY WERE FOUND HAVING MEAN LIVING IN THEIR HOUSE WITH THEIR MOTHER'S CORPSE FOR TEN DAYS WHILE THEY LIVED IT UP IN EAST LONDON AND WENT FISHING AT THE SEASIDE FOR THE CRICKET AT LORD'S
AND I WAS FASCINATED BY THEM AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN COURT AND THE QUESTION REALLY WAS
YES THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT I WANTED TO SOLVE BY RESEARCHING THE BOOK IN EVERY WAY I COULD AND YOU'VE TOLD THE STORY THE INVESTIGATION THE TRIAL BROADMOOR
WHERE THE INSANE ARE INCARCERATED AND THEN THE CLIMAX TO THE STORY REALLY OR IT SATISFACTORY ENDING IN A WAY IN AUSTRALIA BUT DO YOU THINK YOU EVER WERE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION
I THINK I'VE GOT MUCH CLOSER I FEEL LIKE I HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHY I TRY NOT TO IMPOSE THAT ON THE READER I HOPE THE CLUES ARE THERE
AND I HOPE THAT NOT LEAST THROUGH THERE
DEEDS IN LATER LIFE OF THE BOY WHO MURDERED HIS MOTHER THAT THEY THAT THAT HIS DEEDS CAST SOME LIGHT ON HIS ACTIONS AS A CHILD I MENTIONED AUSTRALIA AND HE AFTER HIS RELEASE GOES THERE HE SERVES IN GALLIPOLI AMONG OTHER PLACES IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR
AND HE COMMITS ACTS NOT OF EVIL BUT OF GOOD
YEAH SO REMARKABLY HE SERVED THROUGHOUT THE FIRST WORLD WAR HE WAS AWARDED THE MILITARY MEDAL AND HE WAS ALWAYS
NON COMBATANT ROLE I'LL BE ACTING VERY HEROICALLY ESPECIALLY IN GALLIPOLI WHERE HE WAS A STRETCHER BEARER SO HIS JOB WAS TO RESCUE WOUND THE WOUNDED AND TO BURY THE DEAD OFTEN WHILE UNDER FIRE HIMSELF AND YOU HAD THE MOVING EXPERIENCE OF MEETING SOMEONE
A VERY OLD MAN OBVIOUSLY IN AUSTRALIA WHO HAD KNOWN AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY YOU COULDN'T HAVE EXPECTED THAT WHEN YOU BICKER NO THAT WAS REALLY STARTLING I'D I HADN'T IT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD BE ANYONE ALIVE WHO HAD KNOWN THE BOY I WAS WRITING ABOUT WHO HAD COMMITTED A MURDER IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE
AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT THIS PERSON WHO ARE STILL LIVING HOW HIS LIFE HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED BY HIS ENCOUNTER WITH WITH THIS
MOTHER MURDERER AND AND YET HE HAD NEVER KNOWN THAT HIS SAVIOUR IN EFFECT HAD COMMITTED THIS TERRIBLE CRIME IN HIS PAST YOU'VE COME ACROSS ANOTHER WONDERFUL STORY MANY PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER THAT BESTSELLER THE SUSPICIONS OF MY RICHER ADAPTED FOR TELEVISION BY EICH
I'VE BEEN ENGAGED SINCE SUNDAY LAST AND INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF FRANCES SEVERAL KEPT OF EXAMINE THE PROMISES THAT CONCLUDED THAT THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED BY AN INMATE OF THE HOUSE
OF A CERTAIN QUESTIONS OF THOSE INMATES INCLUDING CONSTANCE KENT EXAMINED HER BEDROOM INCLUDING DRAWS CONTAINING HER PERSONAL
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THESE TRUE CRIMES DO YOU THINK THAT REALLY GRABS PEOPLE'S ATTENTION WHY DO THEY WANT TO SINK THEMSELVES INTO THE WORLD AND THE ATTITUDES AND THE SOCIAL MILIEU OF WHAT ONE HUNDRED AND TEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS AGO
I THINK THAT'S FOR ME ANYWAY THE FASCINATION OF THE TRUE CRIME STILL THE EXTREME EMOTIONS THE DRAMA OFTEN THEY WEIRD PSYCHOLOGY OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED BUT ALSO THAT THE INTENSE AND METICULOUS REPORTING THE CASES AT THE TIME ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE MYSTERIES OR PARTICULARLY IN THEIR HEYDAY YES
IT GIVES YOU AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF DETAIL ABOUT THE SOCIETY IN THE CULTURE HOW PEOPLE LIVED HOW THEY THOUGHT HOW THEY FELT
THESE THESE VERY SENSATIONAL AND BIZARRE CRIMES CAN SOMETIMES CRYSTALLISE THINGS ABOUT HOW OUR SOCIETY COULD THINKS ABOUT ITSELF OR THINKS ABOUT MADNESS OR CHILDHOOD OR CULPABILITY KIDS SUMMER SKILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU JIM IT IS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US THIS MORNING IS CATHERINE PEP INSTA WHO WAS THE EDITOR OF THE TABLA GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING JOHN
WHEN POPE FRANCE'S ANNOUNCED ON THURSDAY THAT HE'S GOING TO SET UP A COMMISSION TO LOOK AT WHETHER WOMEN SHOULD BE DEACONS IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH A LOT OF WOMEN SAID WOW THE CATHOLIC CHURCH UNLIKE THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND OTHER CHRISTIAN DENOMINATIONS HAS CONTINUED TO RESIST ALLOWING WOMEN TO BECOME DEACONS OR PRIESTS SO THIS WAS A SURPRISING MOVE
THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON THAT I THOUGHT WOW IT WAS BECAUSE THE POPE MADE HIS DECISION AFTER ATTENDING A MEETING WITH NINE HUNDRED LEADERS OF NUNS AND HAD BEEN ASKED A QUESTION WHY NOT SET UP A COMMISSION TO STUDY THE ISSUE OF WOMEN DEACONS AND POPE FRANCE'S LISTENED AND AGREED THERE AND THEN TO DO SO
CHURCH LEADERS LIKE PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT ARE NOT ALWAYS KNOWN FOR LISTENING AND EMBRACING SUGGESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR NOR PEOPLE IN BUSINESS
THE FORM OF LEADERSHIP THAT WERE ALMOST USED TO IS SHAPED LIKE A PYRAMID WITH DECISIONS AND IDEAS COMING FROM THE TOP AND FLOWING DOWNWARDS TO PEOPLE AND WE ALSO USED TO A TYPE OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS STRONG TO THE POINT OF RUTHLESSNESS
ACCORDING TO PSYCHOLOGIST DUTCH ACCOUNT HIS NEWLY PUBLISHED BOOK THE POWER PARADOX HAS BEEN MAKING WAVES THIS WEEK THE MOST INFLUENTIAL THINKER ON POWER IS STILL MACHIAVELLI
PEOPLE WHO EXERCISE POWER OFTEN THINK IT MEANS BEING ADVERSARIAL AND MANIPULATIVE PROFESSOR COUNT NOW ARGUES THAT LEADERS OFTEN FORGET THE SKILLS THAT GOT THEM TO THE TOP IN THE FIRST PLACE AND UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE
WHAT'LL WORK BEST IN FUTURE HE SAYS HE'S NOT SO MUCH COERCIVE POWER BUT HAVING MORE EMPATHY AND LISTENING
THIS REMINDS ME OF THE THEOLOGY OF SERVANT LEADERSHIP WHICH HAS DEVELOPED IN CHRISTIANITY MATTHEW'S GOSPEL RECOUNTS RIVALRY BETWEEN THE APOSTLES AND JESUS SAYS TO THEM YOU KNOW THAT THE RULERS OF THE GENTILES LORDING IT OVER THEM AND THEY'RE GREAT ONES ARE TYRANTS IT WILL NOT BE SO AMONG YOU WHOEVER WISHES TO BE FIRST MUST BE YOUR SERVANT
WHEN JESUS WASHED HIS DISCIPLES FEET SOMETHING CONSIDERED A PARTICULARLY HUMBLING ACT HE TOLD THEM HE WAS SETTING AN EXAMPLE IT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF SERVICE AND A RECOGNITION THAT ARE LEADERS SHOULD MAKE THOSE WHO LEADS A PRIORITY
IN OTHER WORDS SERVANT LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT ATTITUDE AS WELL AS ACTION AND CONSIDERATION OF OTHERS
WHAT IT DOESN'T MEAN HIS WEAKNESS AND INDECISIVENESS AND IT STILL REQUIRES A LEADER TO HAVE AUTHORITY WHEN POPE FRANCIS HAD A SUGGESTION FROM THE NUNS ABOUT WOMEN DEACONS HE LISTENED BUT HE STILL HAD THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE A DECISION AND ACT
SERVANT LEADERSHIP MAY NOT YET BE THE NORM THAT HOW POPE FRANCIS RESPONDED TO THE NUNS CHALLENGE ON WOMEN DEACONS IS A SIGN OF HOW EFFECTIVE IT CAN BE
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH CATHERINE PATTERNS TO EDITOR OF THE TABLET THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT WE SPEND A LOT OF YESTERDAY'S PROGRAMME TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE BORN MALE OR FEMALE IN THERE SO UNHAPPY IN THEIR BODIES THAT THEY CHANGE THEIR GENDER THE VERY WORD TRANS GENDER HAS BECOME A PART OF OUR VOCABULARY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THIS NEVER ONCE WAS
WELL ONE OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY A CUPBOARD YESTERDAY IT WAS WHY IT HAPPENS TO SOME PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY IS IT GENETIC NURTURE OR NATURE THAT IS THE ARGUMENT I'M EXCUSE ME I'M JOINED BY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADING GENETICISTS ROBIN LOVELL BADGE IT PROFESSOR BUBBLE BAD HE IS THE GROUP LEADER AND HEAD OF THE DIVISION OF STEM CELL BIOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENTAL GENETICS AT THE FRANCIS CRICK INSTITUTE IS FAMOUS FOR HIS DISCOVERY OF THE GENE ON THE Y. CHROMOSOME THAT DETERMINE SEX IN MEL'S A GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THAT SORT OF THING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT REST ABOUT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANS IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN GENETIC
IT'S THERE IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF EVIDENCE BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO BE SURE ABOUT IT THEN IT'S VERY HARD TO DO ANY STUDIES THERE ARE JUST VERY VERY FEW SCIENTISTS WHO ARE RESEARCHING THIS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES
OF DOING THE WORK AND I'M GETTING FUNDING HAVING COLLEAGUES CONTRIBUTE HAVING PATIENTS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STUDY THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF EVIDENCE SO
DIFFERENT ASPECTS SO YOU CAN DIVIDE IF YOU LIKE HOW WE COME INTO SEVERAL DIFFERENT AREAS SO THERE'S THE SORT OF PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES IN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY AND JUST SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS IF I DIDN'T KNOW THIS UNTIL I CAN TALK TO YOU A LITTLE WHILE AGO
OUR AGENDA IS DETERMINED AFTER ONLY A VERY FEW WEEKS IN THE WOMB BASICALLY THE THAT DECISION TO BE MALE OR FEMALE AS AN EMBRYO TAKES PLACE AROUND SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS OF DEVELOPMENT IN HUMANS AND IT'S TRIGGERED BY WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A Y. CHROMOSOME AND IN PARTICULAR UP AT SPECIFIC DEAN ON THE Y. CHROMOSOME CALLED AS WHY SO IF THAT IS ACTIVE FROM ABOUT SIX WEEKS OF DEVELOPMENT
THEN IT STARTS TURNING WE'RE GOING OUT INTO A TESTIS RATHER THAN AN OVARY RIGHT A MAD TRYING TO ALLOW TO BE MALE FEMALE BEGINS THE WHOLE PROCESS YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH
BUT OF COURSE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HAPPENS IN DEVELOPING TESTIS IS IT STARTS PRODUCING THE MALE HORMONE TESTOSTERONE AND THEM EN MASSE PENALISES YOUR ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY AND PROBABLY YOUR BEHAVIOUR ARE AND MIGHT IT MUSCULAR LIZA HAS TO USE THAT WOULD MORE OR LESS DEPENDING ON CIRCUMSTANCES CORRECT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THAT THAT'S GOOD EVIDENCE FOR THAT BUT IT MAY NOT BE THE ONLY THING SO
IT'S THOUGHT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT INFLUENCES ON WHETHER YOU ARE IF YOU LIKE ON BEHAVIOUR AND THAT YOU CAN DIVIDE THE BEHAVIOUR INTO A SORT OF THREE CATEGORIES SO THE GENDER ROLE SO WHETHER YOU BEHAVE MASCULINE OR FEMININE GENDER PREFERENCE OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION WHETHER YOU PREFER TO BE WITH A MALE OR A FEMALE AND GENDER IDENTITY WHICH IS HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF ARE NOW
THOSE THREE THINGS THERE'S LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE NOT ALWAYS CONNECTED YOU CAN THEY CAN THEY CAN VARY INDEPENDENTLY FROM EACH OTHER NO PROBLEM THIS IS MUCH TOO CRUDE ANALYSIS I KNOW I KNOW AND YOU'LL TAKE MY OFFER IT I'M SURE BUT ARE YOU SAYING THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY BUT GAY PEOPLE ARE BORN NOT MADE THAT HAPPEN AWFULLY CRUDE IT'S IRISH I'M NOT SAYING THAT EITHER THERE IS
THERE IS EVIDENCE FROM GENETIC STUDY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET COS IT'S GREAT THAT HE HAS TO BE DONE ON TWINS AND COMPARING MONOZYGOTIC TWINS IDENTICAL TWINS IDENTICAL TWINS THINGS LIKE THAT VERY HARD TO DO BUT THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A GENETIC INFLUENCE
BUT IT'S QUITE SMALL SO IT'S NO MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT IN THE REST OF IT IS THIRTY PERCENT OUT QUITE A LOT IT'S QUITE A LOT BUT IT'S A VERY WEAK EVIDENCE AND THEY MAY BE MULTIPLE DOSH INVOLVED ON IT BUT IT'S IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT ENVIRONMENT
IS ALSO IMPORTANT BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ENVIRONMENT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DEFINE SO THAT THAT COULD BE ASPECT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER NUTRITION YOUR MOTHER'S NUTRITION FOR THE WAY YOUR CYCLE CLOSING SOCIALLY SO SOCIAL PRESSURES COGNITIVE PROCESS SO HOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU START BECOMING AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND YOU AND YOU SAY I WANT TO BEHAVE MORE LIKE THIS INDIVIDUAL ON THIS VISUAL SO THAT THERE'S ALL THESE DIFFERENT INFLUENCES ON ON HOW WE END UP
AND THE RE YOU SAID RIGHT AT THE START OF THIS CONVERSATION THAT THAT IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO DO THIS RESEARCH IS THAT PARTLY FOR POLITICAL REASONS BECAUSE OF THE DEBATE BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES AND FOR WANT OF A BETTER WORD LIBERALS AND THE OLD THE WHOLE THING ABOUT WELLY O.K. PEOPLE TRANS PEOPLE ARE BORN AND NOT MADE AND ALL THAT THERE'S POLITICAL ISSUES SO IF YOU LIKE THE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT WANT TO
SAY THAT FOR EXAMPLE BEING GAY IT IS IT'S HER IT'S HER CHOICE IS IT IT'S NOT HIM AND SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT YOU SHOULD CHOOSE THE ALTITUDE OF THE OFFICER BEHAVIOUR WAS OF COURSE THEY CAN'T SO THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT YOU WOULD YOU WOULD RULE THAT OUT BECAUSE IT WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S GENETIC OR ENVIRONMENTAL COMBINATION OF ALL THESE THINGS SOCIAL CUES
ONCE ONCE YOU HAVE THAT IT MAY BE CONDITIONING AT AN EARLY AGE YOU CAN BE I CAN BE FIXED FOR LIFE SO YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT WHY SHOULD BE TRIED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT JUST ACCEPT IT WE'RE ALL ON THE SPECTRUM
WHETHER IT'S PHYSICAL SO ANATOMICAL PHYSIOLOGY WHETHER IT'S BEHAVIOURAL WE'RE ALL IN THE SPECTRUM MOST PEOPLE AT ONE END OR THE OTHER
BUT MANY PEOPLE OF SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE AND WE'RE NOW LEARNING THAT TRANS PEOPLE ARE ON THIS SPECTRUM IN THE SAME WAY AS HAPPY OR SOMETHING YEAH I MEAN IT'S MAYBE WE'RE SEEING MORE CASES NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT IT MORE OPENLY AND IT'S JUST BEEN MORE BECOMING MORE ACCEPTED RIGHT BUT AS A SCIENTIST YOU WOULD SAY NOT ONLY THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT BUT WHY SHOULD WE
WHY SHOULD WE MUST BE MY VIEW FOR A LONG TIME WHY DO WE HAVE TO ALWAYS TAKE ON THE PASSPORT THAT WE'RE EITHER MALE OR FEMALE WHY CANNOT IT NOT BE YOU KNOW WHY WE HAVE TO DO THAT AT ALL PUT A SEX BUT IF IF YOU COULD USE I HAVE OTHER OPTIONS SIR SAME OF THIS DEBATE ABOUT BATHROOMS WHICH ARE GOING ON IN THERE
IT'S RIDICULOUS WHY DO YOU HAVE TO FORCE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER I WISH WE HAD ANOTHER HOUR TO TALK ABOUT THIS AT THE FRONT WILL HAVE TO END THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE PROFESSOR ROBIN LOVELL BADGE AND AT THREE MINUTES AWAY WE GET THE WEATHER AND DOWN BET MORNING DAN MORNING JUSTIN WE'VE GOT A COOL NORTHERLY AIRFLOW THIS WEEKEND THERE'LL BE SOME SUNSHINE AROUND FOR MOST OF THE TIME IT'LL BE DRY BUT FOR ONE OR TWO LIGHT SHOWERS

FOR MANY OF US THE WINDS WILL BE LIGHTS NORTHERLY EXCEPT NEAR THE NORTH SEA COASTS WHERE WE'LL HAVE A STRONGER COLDER WIND AND PROBABLY ONE OR TWO LIGHT SHOWERS JUST BUMPING INTO THE EAST COAST OF BOTH SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND BUT AWAY FROM HERE IT SHOULD BE DRY TEMPERATURES A BIT DISAPPOINTING FOR THE TIME OF YEAR TYPICALLY TWELVE OR THIRTEEN DEGREES COMING UP AS HIGH AS FOURTEEN OR SO THROUGH THE CENTRAL BELT OF SCOTLAND NOT A BAD DAY HERE ICE TEMPERATURES FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN DEGREES ACROSS SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND
THIS EVENING SHOOTS AND DRY AND SUNNY FOR MOST PLACES PUT A CLEAR COLD NIGHT ON THE WAY TONIGHT EXCEPT FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF SCOTLAND WHERE CLOUD WILL INCREASE AND WE'LL SEE A FEW SHOWERS BUT ANOTHER CHILLY ONE NOT FAR AWAY FROM FREEZING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST SUNNY START TOMORROW CLOUD WILL INCREASE STONE IT SHOULD BE A CLOUDIER DAY THAN TODAY ONE OR TWO LIGHT SHOWERS SCOTLAND MAYBE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND AGAIN THE WINDS WILL BE LIGHT BEST OF THE SUNSHINE ON ANOTHER CHILLY DAY OUT TOWARDS THE WEST PAYING VERY MUCH NOW HERE IS A STAT FOR YOU

HAS SAID THE CHARITIES BECOME TOO POLITICAL AND MADE MISTAKES IN CHASING PROSECUTIONS AGAINST FOX HUNTS TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THE FUTURE OF LETHAL INJECTION AS A METHOD OF EXECUTION IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN THROWN INTO DOUBT AFTER THE DRUG COMPANY PFIZER ANNOUNCED A BAN ON THE USE OF ITS PRODUCTS THE MOOSE CHANCE OFF THE LAST REMAINING OPEN MARKET SOURCE OF DRUGS FOR EXECUTIONS FOLLOWING SIMILAR ACTIONS BY MORE THAN TWENTY U.S. AND EUROPEAN PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS PFIZER SAID IT WOULD IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF SEVERAL DRUGS IT SAID ITS PRODUCTS WERE MEANT TO SAVE LIVES OUR CORRESPONDENT IN THE UNITED STATES DAVID WILLIS REPORTS
THE DECISION BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS TO MONITOR THE SALE OF PRODUCTS WHICH COULD BE USED IN EXECUTIONS BRINGS PFIZER INTO LINE WITH ALL THE OTHER FEDERALLY APPROVED MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUCH DRUGS AND LEAVES STATES WHICH CARRY OUT SUCH EXECUTIONS LITTLE OPTION BUT TO SEEK OUT OTHER UNOFFICIAL SOURCES IF THEY STILL WANT TO GET HOLD OF THOSE DRUGS IN HER STATEMENT PFIZER SAID ITS PRODUCTS WERE MEANT TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THAT IT STRONGLY OBJECTED TO THEIR USE IN EXECUTIONS
LETHAL INJECTION HAS LONG BEEN THE MOST COMMON FORM OF EXECUTION IN THE UNITED STATES TRADITIONALLY ESTATES RELIED UPON A COMBINATION OF DRUGS TO PUT TO SLEEP AND RESTRICT HIS BREATHING LEADING TO A CARDIAC ARREST A EUROPEAN UNION BAN ON THE EXPORT OF SUCH DRUGS IN TWENTY ELEVEN PROMPTED AMERICAN DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO FOLLOW SUIT AND LEFT OFFICIALS IN SEARCH OF NEW DRUG COCKTAILS BY WHICH THE LETHAL INJECTION COULD BE ADMINISTERED
THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS CRITICISED SIR JOHN MAJOR AFTER HE ACCUSED SOME CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAVE USING FOLDS FIGURES AND STOKING FEARS OF IMMIGRATION SO JOHN MADE HIS COMMENTS IN A SPEECH AT THE OXFORD UNION LAST NIGHT BUT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN REJECTED HIS CLAIM SAID THE QUEUES THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF NAME CALLING OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ELEANOR GARNIER REPORTS

OF BEING RECKLESS SO JOHN ALSO ATTACKED CLAIMS MADE BY BORIS JOHNSON THE FORMER CABINET MINISTER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AND THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO THAT LEAVING THE E.U. COULD SAVE BILLIONS OF POUNDS A YEAR
THEY NEEDED TO APOLOGISE HE SAID FOR PEDDLING A DEMONSTRABLE UNTRUTH BUT BELIEVE CAMPAIGNER AND JUSTICE MINISTER DOMINIK RAB SAID HIS SIDE WAS TRYING TO HANDLE A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION RESPONSIBLY HE SAID IT WAS SOMETHING PEOPLE CARED ABOUT AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESPONSIBLE NOT TO BE TALKING ABOUT IT LET'S HAVE THE DEBATE HE SAID BUT ON SUBSTANCE NOT NAME CALLING
THE NEW HEAD OF THE R.S.P.C.A. JEREMY COOPER SAID THE CHARITY HAD BECOME TOO ADVERSARIAL AND WILL NOW BE IN HIS WORDS A LOT LESS POLITICAL IS TO COOPER TOLD THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HE WAS VERY SORRY FOR MISTAKES MADE IN THE PAST OWEN AMOS HAS MORE DETAILS IN TWENTY TWELVE THE R. S. P. C. A. WAS CRITICISED FOR SPENDING THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS TO PRIVATELY PROSECUTE A FOX HUNT IN OXFORDSHIRE
ALTHOUGH THE PROSECUTION WAS SUCCESSFUL THE DISTRICT JUDGE SAID THE SUM WAS QUITE STAGGERING MY COOPER SAID IT WAS VERY UNLIKELY THEY WOULD BRING ANOTHER PROSECUTION AGAINST A HUNT AND WOULD INSTEAD PASS INFORMATION TO THE AUTHORITIES
HE ALSO SAID THE R.S.P.C.A. WAS WRONG TO SUGGEST THAT FARMERS WHO CALLED BADGES SHOULD BE NAMED AND SHAMED MY CUPA A FORMER CORPORAL IN THE R.A.F. TOOK UP HIS ROLE LAST MONTH HE SAID HIS STYLE WOULD BE BASED ON ENCOURAGEMENT AND DIALOGUE
OFFICIALS IN PERU'S SAY A SCOTTISH WOMAN WHO WAS JAILED FOR SMUGGLING DRUGS IS TO BE RELEASED FROM PRISON AND RETURN TO THE U.K. MELISSA READ WHO TWENTY TWO WAS JAILED THREE YEARS AGO ALONGSIDE MICHAELA MCCALLUM FROM COUNTY TYRONE WHO WAS FEET LAST MONTH BUT REMAINS IN PERU THEY WERE CAUGHT WITH COCAINE WORTH ONE AND A HALF MILLION POUNDS IN FOOD PACKAGES IN THEIR LUGGAGE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN
THE MAN WHO BOUGHT B.H.S. FROM SIR PHILIP GREEN HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THE RETAILER COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED IF IT HAD BEEN GIVEN MORE TIME DOMINIC SHOULD TOLD NEWSNIGHT THAT B.H.S. WOULD'VE BEEN BREAKING EVEN BY SEPTEMBER NEXT YEAR AND THAT UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP THE FIRM HAD BEEN MAKING HUGE PROGRESS YES A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT ADAM PARSONS
IT IS JUST OVER A YEAR SINCE DOMINIC BOUGHT B.H.S. FOR A POUND MY PEARL HAD NO RETAIL EXPERIENCE AND HAD BEEN DECLARED BANKRUPT THREE TIMES BUT HE CLAIMED TO BE A SPECIALIST IN TURNING AROUND TROUBLED COMPANIES THIRTEEN MONTHS LATER AND B.H.S.

GET THEM IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN EVENTUALLY GO BACK IF THE WAR EVER ENDS IT'S A RADICAL PROPOSITION AND POLITICALLY FRAUGHT BUT IT POINTS TO THE RECOGNITION OF A GROWING PROBLEM THAT IS SEEMINGLY WITHOUT END
YOU CAN HEAR MORE OF THAT INTERVIEW WITH DAVID MILLIBAND ON THIS WEEK'S WORLD ON B. B. C. TWO AT FIVE TWENTY P. M.
A VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS HAS SAID THE BODY MUST REFORM ADAPT AND CHANGE TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS OF MEMBERS UNIONS AT NEWCASTLE AND LINCOLN HAVE VOTED TO SPLIT FROM THE CENTRAL BODY SAYING IT NO LONGER REPRESENT STUDENTS RECENTLY ELECTED N.U.S. PRESIDENT BUT HERE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF ANTI SEPARATISM BECAUSE OF REMARK SHE'S MADE IN THE PAST SHE DENIES THE CLAIM RICHARD BROOKS ONE OF HER VICE PRESIDENTS TOLD US THAT BREAKING AWAY WAS NOT THE ANSWER
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR STUDENTS THEY DO NOT AGREE OF THE COMMONS THAT THE MATE NEITHER DO I. IF YOU DISAGREE OF THE POLITICAL DIRECTION OF A NATIONAL ORGANISATION FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT I'M SAYING TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS I'VE DONE THE COUNTRY IS THAT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING A DIFFERENT FORM OF LEADERSHIP OR SOMETHING ELSE YOU GET INVOLVED IN THE NATIONAL ORGANISATION
POLITICIANS IN TEXAS ARKANSAS AND SEVERAL OTHER U.S. STATES HAVE VOWED TO FIGHT A GOVERNMENT DECREE WHICH SAYS TRANS GENDER STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHICH TOILETS THEY USE AT SCHOOL WHO DIRECTED FROM THE U.S. JUSTICE AND EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING BUT SCHOOLS THAT DON'T COMPLY COULD HAVE THEIR FUNDING REDUCED OUR CORRESPONDENT A MC BALL REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON
THIS ALL STARTED WHEN ONE STATE NORTH CAROLINA PAST THE LAWS SAYING YOU COULD ONLY USE TOILETS ACCORDING TO YOUR GENDER AT BIRTH BUT THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOW SENT A MESSAGE TO SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TELLING THEM TO PROTECT TRANS GENDER STUDENTS' RIGHTS ALLOWING THEM TO USE THE BATHROOM MATCHING THEIR CHOSEN IDENTITY MARA KEYS LING IS HEAD OF THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR TRANS GENDER EQUALITY TAV THE PRESENT UNITED STATES SAY
WE GOT YOUR BACK WE'RE GOING TO ENFORCE THE LAW THERE IS A HUGE RELIEF FOR TRANS PEOPLE AND IN A RELIEF THERE WAS REALLY NEWLYN BUT SOME POLITICIANS LIKE TEXAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DAN PATRICK SAY THEY'LL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EDICT TO ALLOWED TRANS GENDER PUPILS TO USE THE SCHOOL BATHROOMS THEY WANT HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO WITHHOLD FUNDING AT STALLS DO NOT FOLLOW THE POLICY WALLET TEXAS
HE CAN KEEP HIS THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER WE WALNUT TO BLACKMAIL
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN RECENT YEARS L.G.B.T. RIGHTS HAVE IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY IN THE U.S. BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE CONSERVATIVES OR DIGGING IN THEIR HEELS AND PROMISING A LONG FIGHT
BULL REPORTING THE TIME TEN PAST EIGHT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR CHILD IN AN ENGLISH SCHOOL FOR MORE THAN NINETY PER CENT OF THE SCHOOL YEAR THAT SEEMS TO BE THE EFFECT OF THE HIGH COURT RULING YESTERDAY ON THAT CHAP FROM THE ISLE OF WIGHT WHO HAD BEEN FINED FOR TAKING A SCHOOL AT THE CHILD OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A HOLIDAY MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND FINE
EACH YEAR THEY MIGHT ALL NOW BE ABLE TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK AND MORE SERIOUSLY THEY AND OTHERS CAN NOW USE THE JUDGEMENT TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT ATTENDANCE AND SCHOOL AND TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN ON POTENTIALLY CHEAPER HOLIDAYS AS WELL YESTERDAY THE PARENTING QUESTION JOHN PLATT TOLD US WHY HE THOUGHT THE FINDS WEREN'T A DETERRENT
WE'RE NORTH OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PARENTS A YEAR ARE GETTING FIND OF COURSE WILL PROBABLY BE THE SAME NUMBER WHO DID IT OR DIDN'T GET FIND IT'S NOT CHANGING BEHAVIOUR TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE ALL AS IT'S DOING IS CRIMINALISING OR ATTEMPTING TO CRIMINALISE PARENTS WHO'D LARGELY ARE DOING ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING AND ABIDING BY THE LAW
BUT THIS IDEA THAT THEY'VE GOT INTO THEIR HEADS THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES GOING TO THEIR HEADS THAT THEY KNOW BETTER THAN YOU AS A PARENT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR KIDS HAS TO COME TO YOU KNOW WHILE GOVERNMENT DEMONIC DOCTORS THIS MORNING BUT THERE IS TALK OF CHANGING THE LAW AND CARMICHAEL IS THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. WHO CHAIRS THE EDUCATION SELECT COMMITTEE AT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN
I CERTAINLY THINK WE NEED A PERIOD OF REFLECTION ON THIS MATTER BECAUSE THIS RULING DOES CAUSE A HUGE AMOUNT OF CONFUSION AND INSTEAD OF CONFUSION WE DO NEED CLARITY CLARITY FOR PARENTS AND CLARITY FOR THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL BE WONDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT GIVEN THE SCALE OF THIS CHANGE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT MY PLAIT WAS SAYING BOTH IN THAT CLIP BUT ALSO MORE WIDELY YESTERDAY THAT ACTUALLY PARENTS SENSIBLE PARENTS NEED TO HAVE THIS AMOUNT OF FREEDOM AND THEY USED TO GET IT
I THINK THERE ARE TWO TWO POINTS TO MAKE ONE IS OBVIOUSLY CHILDREN SHOULD BE GOING TO SCHOOL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO LEARN AND THAT'S WHERE THERE ARE GOING TO HAD DEVELOPED FACULTIES FOR FOR THEIR FUTURE LIVES AND THE GOVERNMENT IS RIGHT TO PUT AN EMPHASIS ON ATTENDANCE WE DON'T WANT SCHOOLS TO FIND THE CLASSROOM TO HALF EMPTY
ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PARENTS ARE THINKING ABOUT IN THE TERMS OF THE OUT OUT OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL ACTIVITY AND THAT'S THE BALANCE WE'VE GOT TO STRIKE AND WHAT WE HEARD EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME FROM NICK BAKE IN THE SHADOWS SCHOOLS MINISTER AND HE WAS PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT LABOUR'S VIEW IS NOW AND HE SAYS WHAT WE WANT TO GO BACK TO IS THE SITUATION BEFORE TWENTY THIRTEEN
WHERE UNDER THE RELEVANT REGULATIONS A HEAD TEACHER COULD GRANT LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR UP TO TEN DAYS FOR THE PURPOSES OF A FAMILY HOLIDAY IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES IS THAT SOMETHING YOU THINK MIGHT BE SENSIBLE AGAIN SO THIS IS THE RULER WAS CHANGED TIGHTENED UP BY MICHAEL YEAH I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT'S I THINK THE ISSUE WHICH THIS QUESTION WOULD START TO REST ON BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT DEFINING WHAT YOU THINK IT IS IS A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE
THE GUN WILL HAVE TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE HAPPENS TO BE THAT THERE'S A CHEAP HOLIDAY ON OFFER AND WE WANT TO GO LOOK AT IT NOT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE SITUATION WASN'T IT AND THAT'S THE CERTAINLY THE SITUATION FOR
QUITE A FEW PARENTS YOU'RE SAYING WE COULD NOT YOU WOULDN'T BE ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE THAT DEGREE OF LAXITY WELL THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF THAT APPLIED TO A LARGE NUMBER OF SCHOOL CHILDREN AT THE SAME TIME THAT WOULD REALLY DISRUPT TEACHING FOR THEM AND OF COURSE THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CUP BACK PARTICULAR CLASS SO I THINK THAT WE WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD A LITTLE BIT
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I THINK UNDERPINS THIS IS ACTUALLY WHEN WHEN ALL THE TERMS AND CAN WE HAVE YOU CAN WE NOT BE SLIGHTLY MORE FLEXIBLE ABOUT THAT
DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE AN AREA TO GO INTO THEM RATHER THAN SIMPLY GOING BACK TO THE SITUATION BEFORE TWENTY THIRTEEN YOU THINK THAT WOULDN'T BE THAT WOULDN'T BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO JUST SAYING ABOLISH THE GO CHANGES AND GO BACK THAT SITUATION YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING MORE MORE SUBTLE MORE FLEXIBLE I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A WAY FORWARD AND I'LL BE DISCUSSING IT WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF MAY WHEN WE MEET NEIL CARMICHAEL CHAIRMAN OF THE EDUCATION SELECT COMMITTEE HAS COME THANKS VERY MUCH
FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT SOME OF THE WORLD'S BEST ATHLETES MAY NOT BE APPEARING AT THE OLYMPICS BECAUSE
WELL THEY ARE NOT THE WORLD'S BEST ATHLETES THEY WON THEIR MEDALS IN THE PAST BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN USING DRUGS OR AT LEAST THAT IS THE ALLEGATION AGAINST THEM I'M JOINED BY A SPORTS EDITOR DOWN ROLL BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH OLYMPIC ASSOCIATION SEGRAVE GRAVY DOWN A BIT OF BACKGROUND WERE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT KENNY AND OF COURSE RUSSIA
ABSOLUTELY JOHN YES LET'S TALK CAN YOU BRIEFLY FIRST THEY HAD A BIG DECISION MADE BY THE WORLD ENDED EARLY AGENCY THIS WEEK WHEN THEY WERE DECLARED NON COMPLIANCE THAT MEANS EFFECTIVELY IN BREACH OF WORLD ANTI DOPING RULES THEY'D ALREADY MISSED TWO DEADLINES TO GET THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER EFFECTIVELY WHAT THAT MEANT WAS MAKING A NEW NATIONAL ANTI DOPING AGENCY FULLY OPERATIONAL AT THE MOMENT DESPITE BEING ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING NATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO MIDDLE AND LONG DISTANCE RUNNING THEY DON'T HAVE A PROPER NATIONAL ANTI DOPING AGENCY THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR WILDER
HAD BEEN PUTTING PRESSURE ON THEM FOR MONTHS TO DO SO THEY'D MISSED DEADLINES AND THEN FINALLY THEY RAN OUT OF PATIENTS THIS WEEK DECLARING THEM NON COMPLIANT AND THAT DOES OPEN UP A POSSIBILITY ALTHOUGH IT'S UNLIKELY THREAT I SUSPECT THAT THE EYE OH SEE THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE COULD IN FACT TAKE THE THE DRAMATIC DECISION TO BAN THEM FROM GAMES DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY THEY SHOULD BECAUSE THAT WOULD ACT AS A DETERRENT FOR OTHER NATIONS WHO HAVE PROBLEMS WHEN IT COMES TO DOPING CAN YOU HAVE HAD A SPATE OF
OF A HIGH PROFILE DOPING TESTS IN RECENT YEARS AND MANY BELIEVE THEY NEED TO DO MORE AND PREVENTING THEIR ATHLETES FROM COMPETING WOULD BE A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY SOME BELIEVE OF DOING SO OTHERS SUSPECT THAT WOULD BE HARSH ON INNOCENT ATHLETES IT'S TOO EXTREME AND IT'S UNPRECEDENTED BUT OF COURSE HAS AS YOU MENTIONED WE DO HAVE HAD PRESIDENT OF SORTS IN THAT RUSSIA
HE'S ALREADY BANNED AT LEAST ITS ATHLETES ARE THAT WAS A DECISION TAKEN BY THE IDYLL A.F. ATHLETICS GOVERNING BODY BECAUSE OF SYSTEMIC STATE SPONSORED CHEATING WHICH THE KENYANS WOULD ARGUE IS MUCH WORSE THAN WHAT WHAT THEIR PROBLEM IT'S ADDED IN ARGUABLE REALLY THE EVIDENCE AGAINST RUSSIA'S HUGE IT'S MOUNTING CERTAINLY THE RUSSIANS SAY THAT THEIR VICTIMS ABOUT THE POLITICAL WITCH HUNT AND THEY'RE BEING SINGLED OUT HOWEVER
THE EVIDENCE AS I SAY IS HE'S GETTING WORSE BY THE DAY IT SEEMS THIS WEEK THERE'S BEEN TWO HIGH PROFILE SETS ALLEGATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES MEDIA BUT BOAT A DOCUMENTARY AND THEN AN EXPLOSIVE SET OF CLAIMS IN THE NEW YORK TIMES CENTRING AROUND THE FORMER HEAD OF THE MAIN ANTI DOPING LAB IN IN MOSCOW DOCTOR GREGORY SS
RODCHENKO OFTEN HE EFFECTIVELY CLAIMS THAT HE PROVIDED DRUGS FOR A NUMBER OF RUSSIAN ATHLETE THE SHE WINTER OLYMPICS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IS IT'S PRETTY DISTURBING AGAIN THE RUSSIANS DENY THIS THEY SAY THAT HE'S LYING WHAT IT IS DOING NOW IS MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER TO SEE HOW RUSSIA CAN BE REINSTATED
ON JUNE SEVENTEENTH BY THE DOUBLE A. F. IN TIME FOR THE RIO GAMES AND THAT WOULD BE A HUGE CALL IT'S ALSO UNDERMINING THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ENTIRE ANTI DOPING PROCEDURE AND REGIME IT'S RAISING SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY IT WAS WARNED ABOUT SOME OF THESE CLAIM SOME YEARS AGO BY A BY A WHISTLE BLOWER DOESN'T APPEAR IN SOME PEOPLE'S PAIN INTO A TAKE AN EFFECTIVE ACTION
AND IT'S ALSO I THINK MEANING THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A STATE IS GETTING LESS AND LESS THAT THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM WHICH IS THE U.K. ANTI DOPING AGENCY WHICH IS BEING HAS BEEN CONDUCTING TESTS IN RUSSIA WHILE THE RUSSIAN ANTI DOPING AUTHORITIES ARE SUSPENDED THEIR GROWING FRUSTRATED WITH WHAT THEY SEE AS A LACK OF CO OPERATION AND THERE WAS TALK OF THEM PULLING OUT AND THAT WOULD BE A GREAT BLOW FOR THE RUSSIAN WILL STAY WITH US BECAUSE HER SO WELL GOODS AGREE REALLY MONITOR
HELLO LOWERING OUR COOK COME ON HE'S WELL GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WILL RUSH SHOULD BE REINSTATED
WELL WHICH RUSSIA WE'RE INVOLVED IN DEALING WITH THE RUSSIAN ANTI DOPING AGENCY WHICH WAS DECLARED NON COMPLIANT THE INTERNATIONAL AMATEUR LET EACH FEDERATION TO DEAL WITH THE ATHLETICS NATIONAL FEDERATION OF RUSSIA SO THE NON COMPLIANCE EXISTS AND HAS EXISTED SINCE NOVEMBER LAST YEAR AND THAT'S THE BIT THAT YUKI ANTI DOPING I'VE BEEN HELPING WITH THE SIMPLE FIELD ATHLETICS
I WAS GOING TO SAY IN SIMPLE TERMS WILL WE SEE RUSSIA ATHLETES COMPETING IN BRAZIL THIS SUMMER
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT UNTIL THE SEVENTEENTH OF NOVEMBER SORRY SEVENTEEN JUNE WHEN I UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE DATE AT WHICH THE A DOUBLE F. OR DECIDE ON THE TRACK AND FIELD THAT'S LECTRIX BUT I SUPPOSE YEAH SORRY
YEAH I THINK YOU SHOULD LET ME EXPLAIN AS FAR AS THE RUSSIAN ANTI DOPING AGENCY IS CONCERNED I THINK IT HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THAT ORGANISATION WOULD BE COMPLIANT BY THE TIME OF THE OF THE GAMES IN RIO THIS YEAR WHEN AN ASIAN IS NON COMPLIANT WE REPORT THAT INFORMATION TO ALL CONSENT THAT'S THE SPORT OR REPORT IT TO THE MAJOR EVENT ORGANISERS
AND CLEARLY THAT WOULD BE AT THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE AND IT IS THEIR DECISION OF WHETHER OF THE ATHLETES FOR RUSSIA GO TO THE GAMES AND IT PRESUMABLY IT WILL BE A WII DOUBLE THE F. DECISION ON WHETHER THE SUSPENSION OF THE TRACK AND FIELD NATIONAL FEDERATION IS LIFTED THE LOT RIGHT SO TO BE CLEAR SO I WAS TRYING TO DO HER UP YOU BUY I THINK WE HAVE A SLIGHT DELAY ON THE LINE
AS PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT RUSSIAN ATHLETES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO PERFORM AT THE OLYMPICS
WELL AS I'VE TRIED TO SAY THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGES IT DID IS IT IT WAS DEPUTED AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPLIANCE OF IT STICK HOLDERS THE FINAL DECISION IS TAKEN IN SOMEBODY ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE ANOTHER EVENT ORGANISER
I THINK MY VIEW IT AS IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY PRESIDENT YOU DROPPING AGENCY I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT OUT SHOW IF YOU ASKED HIM USED TO SPORTS OFFICIAL I WOULD SEE THAT I AM IN FAVOUR OF EVERYBODY TAKING PART IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES ON ONE CONDITION THAT IS THAT THEY ALL PLAYED BY THE RULES OF THE POLITICALLY ISN'T THAT A BIT OF A COPPER
NOT NECESSARILY BUT IT'S A SITUATION THAT I FIND MYSELF IN I HAVEN'T BEEN GIVING THOSE POWERS IT'S PROBABLY UNREALISTIC FOR ME TO SEE ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT THAT YOU KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT DOPING YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF THE
AGENCY OVER WHAT I DO AND IN THAT CAPACITY YOU HAVE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT DO YOU HAVE A VERY CLEAR VIEW WAS TO WHETHER RUSSIA HAS DONE ENOUGH TO CLEAN THE SPORT UP AND MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THE ANSWER THAT IS POSITIVELY NO IT HASN'T
THAT OVERSIGHT AGAIN IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT DOWN ROWAN HAS JUST SAID WHEN THE INITIAL EVIDENCE ON RUSSIA BECAME APPARENT AFTER OUR INDEPENDENT COMMISSION REPORTED ROUGHLY IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR WE IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDED IN A LOGICAL LABORATORY WE IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDED THE RUSSIAN RENT TO DOPING AGENCY
AND THE EYE DOUBLE F. SUSPENDER THE ATHLETICS FEDERATION WE DIDN'T DO THAT LIGHTLY WE DID THAT UNCLEARED EVIDENCE OF BREACHES OF THE REGULATIONS AGAIN FOR MY POINT OF VIEW IT WON'T NO READ THE ALLEGATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WITH THIS WEEK IN THE NEW YORK TIMES I WERE HORROR FIGHT I MEAN IF HE COUNTRY IS PREPARED TO IF THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE I HAVE TO SEE IF THEY ARE TRUE AND THEY NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED
THEN WATCH HOUSE APPEARED TO HAPPEN IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AND PEOPLE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS FROM THOSE FIGHTS RIGHT IN IT BRIEFLY
IF THEY WERE TO TAKE PART IN RUSSIA WAS TO TAKE PART IN THE OLYMPICS IT WOULD SEND ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG MESSAGE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD
I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE I AM NOT YET CONVINCED THAT EVERYBODY IN RUSSIA IS SENDING THE DRUG RULES QUITE CLEARLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
AND WE HAVE TO WEED THEM OUT I CAN ONLY ASSUME FEAR A PERCENTAGE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE RUSSIAN TEAM THAT WE GO TO MOSCOW WOULD BE CLEARED ATHLETES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SITTING HERE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHO IS CLEAN AND WHO IS DIRTY YOU'VE GOT TO WEAVE THEM OUT HAVEN'T YOU
YOU'VE GOT TO BE DONE PRECISELY TO DO WE'RE TRYING PRECISELY AT THE MOMENT TO DO JUST THAT ALL RIGHT SO CRAIG REALLY AND THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THE TIME TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT IT'S FACEBOOK CENSORING RIGHT WING OPINION IT'S SOMETHING WE TOUCHED ON DURING THE COURSE OF THE WEEK ON THIS PROGRAMME AND NOW MUCH AS I COULD BUT I HAVE THE FOUNDER OF FACEBOOK AS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INVITE LEADING CONSERVATIVES FROM ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM IN THE UNITED STATES TO COME IN AND DISCUSS ALLEGATIONS OF POLITICAL BIAS IN OTHER WORDS HE ACCEPTS THAT THERE IS A CASE TO ANSWER
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE TRENDING SECTION ON FACE BUT THE LITTLE BOX WITH NEW STORIES IN IT WHO HAS CHOSEN WHAT YOU ARE SEEING THERE HOW WAS IT CHOSEN IT MATTERS BECAUSE FACEBOOK REACHES SIX BILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
AND INCREASING NUMBERS OF THOSE PEOPLE RELY ON FACEBOOK FOR THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT'S GOING ON YOU MIGHT ASSUME THAT STORY'S CHOSEN BY FACEBOOK AT BEING CHOSEN DISPASSIONATELY BY A COMPUTER ALGORITHM WELL IT SEEMS IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT A DOCTOR ALISON POWELL HE'S HERE SHE DIRECTS THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS DATA ON SOCIETY COURSE AND MCNAMARA'S ONLINE WRITES ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THE TECH WEBSITE THE NEXT MORNING TO YOU BOTH
MORNING A DOCTOR POW FIRST OF ALL HOW DOES FACEBOOK CHOOSE WHAT IS SEEN IN THAT BOX
WELL IT'S A SORT OF TWO STEP PROCESS THERE IS A COMPUTER ALGORITHM THAT DETERMINES WHAT KINDS OF THINGS PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN AND SEARCHING FOR AND CLICKING ON WITHIN FACEBOOK BUT THAT IS ALSO COMBINED WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AT THESE RESULTS AND DECIDING WHICH ELEMENTS OF THOSE SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE TREND IN BUCKS AND IS THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE SURPRISE TO SUMMON LIST WE WERE YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WILL BE DONE JUST AUTOMATICALLY WHAT WHAT WHAT WHY OTHER PEOPLE NECESSARY
WELL PEOPLE ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THE RESULTS OF A OF AN ALGORITHM ARE GOING TO BE A LIST OF DATA A LIST OF ELEMENTS AND THESE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CATEGORIES AND SUB CATEGORIES SO IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR AN ALGORITHM TO DISTINGUISH FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN THE TOPIC OF DOPING AND THE DETAIL OF THE REGULATIONS AGAINST DOPING TO TAKE THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT
IN FACT THESE ARE EDITORIAL CHOICES IN THE CASE OF FACE BUT THAT'S WHAT'S FASCINATING ABOUT ISN'T IT BECAUSE THESE ARE EDITORIAL CHOICES AND WE SORT OF TENDER AT LEAST WE HAVE IN THE PAST THOUGHT OF FACEBOOK AND OTHER OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AS AS PLATFORMS MORE THAN PUBLISHES YEAH THIS IS EXACTLY RIGHT AND I THINK THAT THE BIG ISSUE HERE IS NOT THE FACT THAT FACEBOOK IS NECESSARILY DONE SOMETHING
MAJORLY WRONG YET IS THE FACT THAT THERE'S THE PERCEPTION THAT THEY COULD DO AND THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY OVER THERE THE WAY THE TRENDING WORKED I THINK THAN MOST PEOPLE REALISE THAT A BIG MEDIA ORGANISATIONS HAVE POLITICAL BIAS WITHIN THE WAY THEY EDITORIAL DECISIONS ARE MADE BUT I THINK THERE WAS
AGAIN AT THE PERCEPTION THAT FACE BUT WAS MORE NEUTRAL NOW THAT'S BEEN REVEALED NOT TO BE SO WHAT DO YOU THINK MUM BUT NEEDS TO DO TO TO TO REMEDY IT WELL HE'S DOWN THERE HAS BEEN A NOW THIS INVITATION TO HAVE PEOPLE COME IN FROM THE CONSERVATIVE ORGANISATIONS AND I THINK THAT'S ONE STEP IS I THINK IT'S A BIG P.R. EXERCISE TO BE HONEST I THINK THE AVERAGE USER ISN'T GOING TO BE TOO AFFECTED OR BOTHERED I SHOULD SAY EFFECT A BIT BOTHERED BY WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS BUT
THERE IS A BIGGER QUESTION MARK OVER HER FACEBOOK AS A MEDIA ORGANISATION IT'S THE BIGGEST THE WORLD'S LARGEST MEDIA ORGANISATION NOW AND WE HAVE TO QUESTION WHAT ARE WE SEEING AND END UP ON FACEBOOK IS IT ACTUALLY NEUTRAL AND IF IT'S A MEDIA ORGANISATION DOCTOR PAL THEN IT SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE B. B. SEETHING ANOTHER LARGE MEDIA ORGANISATIONS WHERE THERE ARE LAWS OF THERE ARE RULES ABOUT THE KIND OF THINGS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO SPECIFICALLY THE RULES ARE LIABLE
THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF WHETHER YOU ARE A PUBLISHER OR WHETHER YOU'RE JUST A PLATFORM SAYING IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH A SCARF IS GOING TO CHANGE YEAH FOR A LONG TIME AS MOUNT SAID THESE THESE ORGANISATIONS HAVE CLAIMED THAT THEY WERE PLATFORMS AND THAT THEY ARE AS SUCH NOT TRULY LIABLE OR ETHICALLY
SUBJECT TO DECISIONS ABOUT THE PUBLIC INTEREST FOR EXAMPLE AND NOW I THINK THIS CASE IS REALLY MAKING IT VERY CLEAR THAT FACEBOOK CAN NO LONGER CLAIM MERELY TO BE A KIND OF PLATFORM THAT IS INTERIM MEDIATING ONLY BY SHOWING US WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN IT IS CLEAR THAT ALL OF OUR LONG THROUGH THE ALGORITHMS NOT JUST FOR TRENDING BUT ALSO FOR THE NEWS FEED THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING
KINDS OF DECISIONS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO EDITORIAL DESCENDER THAT APPLIED A GOOGLE AND THE OTHERS WELL YOU COULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT THAT THESE KINDS OF PLATFORMS THERE GAFFER PLATFORMS GOOGLE EMMA'S ON FACEBOOK AND APPLE ARGH
INCREASINGLY TAKING ROLES NOT ONLY AS A SORT OF NEUTRAL INTERMEDIARIES BUT ACTUALLY ALSO AS COMPANIES THAT SHAPER EXPERIENCE BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE MIGHT EXPECT NOT JUST FROM A MEETING WITH CONSERVATIVE LEADERS BUT FROM A AND KIND OF MEDIA REFORM THE TARGETS PLATFORMS AS PERHAPS SOMETHING
THE TAKES THEM MORE IN LINE WITH THE KINDS OF MEDIA ORGANISATIONS THAT THAT WE HAVE AND THAT WE HAVE TODAY SO THE U.S. SENATE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REVIEW FACEBOOK'S GUIDELINES AN OVERSIGHT IN RELATION TO THE DECISIONS MADE ABOUT THE TRENDING TOPIC SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD START BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH THE SENATE INVESTIGATION IS THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF
BIAS THAT MAY NOT BE CLEAR IN THE WAY THAT FACEBOOK ACTUALLY ORGANIA UNCONSCIOUS AND THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT MAN OF ARCH IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN NECESSARILY OBVIOUS POLITICAL BUYERS WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE I THINK I AGREE WITH WHAT I'M DOCTOR POWELL SAYING REALLY THAT THESE COMPANIES NOW LIKE FACEBOOK GO A BIG MEDIA ORGANISATIONS THEY'VE SUCKED A LOT OF THE POWER AWAY FROM THE NEWS ORGANISATIONS THE TRADITIONAL NEWS ORGANISATIONS BY NOW CONSUMING HOW MEDIA IS JUST DISTRIBUTED
IN MY OPINION I THINK THE RULES APPLY TO TO FACEBOOK IN TERMS OF HOW ITS EDITORIAL DECISIONS ARE MADE AND THE TRANSPARENCY NEEDS TO GIVE ALL THE RULES THAT APPLY TO PEOPLE LIKE THE B. B. C. OR TWO OTHER NEWSPAPERS SHOULD REALLY APPLY EQUALLY TO TO FACEBOOK BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT THAT JUST YET INTERESTING MATT NAVARRA AND ADULT ALISON THANKS BUT THANK YOU THANK YOU
IT OVER THIS PAST A GARAGE SPORT JOHN JUSTIN GOOD MORNING SATURDAY MORNING HEADLINES INCLUDE THE STORY THAT HARLEQUINS WERE BEATEN TWENTY SIXTEEN OR TWENTY SIX NINETEEN BY MONTPELLIER IN THE FINAL OF THE EUROPEAN CHALLENGE CUP SUPER LEAGUE RESULTS OR WHOLE BEAT WIGAN THIRTY SIXTEEN HULL A SECOND IN THE TABLE SAINT HELENS DEFEATED SALFORD THIRTY FOUR TWENTY
GOLF THE PLAYERS' CHAMPIONSHIP WAS HIT BY WEATHER PROBLEMS ISLAND SHANE LOWRY IS IN SECOND PLACE BEHIND JASON DAY WHO STILL HAS FOUR HOLES TO PLAY RORY MCELROY IS SIX OFF THE PACE AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY BE BRIGHTON TWO NIL IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP PLAY OFF GAME WELL FALKIRK DEFEATED HIPS THREE TWO AND THEY'LL KNOW FACE KILMARNOCK IN THE SCOTTISH PREMIERSHIP PLAY OFF FINAL
THE FINAL WEEKEND OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON AND THEN ON MONDAY MORNING AT ELEVEN ENGLAND MANAGER ROY HODGSON WILL NAME HIS SQUAD FOR THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS WAYNE ROONEY'S POSITION IN THE TEAM HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF GREAT DEBATE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO HIS FORMER ENGLAND AND MANCHESTER UNITED TEAM MAKE RIO FERDINAND TO ASK FOR HIS VIEW
HE HAS TO BE ON THE FLIGHT I THINK I'VE HEARD DEBATES HERE AND THERE WERE THREE SHOULD GO OR NOT HE HAS TO BE I THINK WE'VE GOT VERY YOUNG SQUAD AND THAT SQUAT AT TIMES IN THIS TOURNAMENT ON AND OFF TO PITCH ARE GOING TO NEED TO LOOK AT SOMEONE WHO'S GOT EXPERIENCE AND LOOK FOR SOME COMFORT AT TIMES BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW CHRISTMAS SPURS PLAYERS INVOLVED
A SOURCE SIGNS IN THE CHELSEA GAME THE OTHER DAY THAT EXPERIENCE WILL COME IN HANDY AT TIMES IN THIS TOURNAMENT I THINK THERE WAS A FEAR OF THE GAME SLIP HIM SLIPPING OUT OF THEIR HANDS TO LEAGUE SLIPPING AWAY FROM HIM AND THEY MAYBE NEEDED A HEAD IN THAT GAME TO CON THE SHIP A LITTLE BIT AND SO LISTEN KEEP YOUR HEAD WE CAN GET A GOAL IN THE LAST MINUTE IN THE LAST SECOND SO LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT IN A SQUAD LIKE THIS AND IT'S ALL IN A TOURNAMENT ENVIRONMENT EXPERIENCES TO WHETHER WAYNE ROONEY PLAYS A NOT THAT IS UP FOR DEBATE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT FAR DOING IF YOU'RE GONNA PLAY TOP FRONT ON FORM IN TERMS OF GOALS
THEY'VE GOT A STRONG CLAIM TO PLAY BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WAYNE ROONEY WILL PLACE AN IMPORTANT PASSING THEM AT SOME POINT IN THE TOURNAMENT
DO YOU NOT THINK ROONEY COULDN'T PLAY IN THE SAME STARTING ELEVEN AS VAD IAN CAME YEAH THAT WOULD BE MY PREFERRED FOURTH FORMATION OF PLAYER BACK FOR
I'LL PLAY A DIAMOND IN RICH SOIL AND WAYNE ROONEY AT THE TOP OF IT AND I PLAY VIA DOING COMING UP FRONT BUT DO YOU THINK THE MANAGER WON'T DO THAT DO YOU THINK THAT PERHAPS IT WILL BE BARDI ON THE BENCHES AN IMPACT PLAYER MAYBE BUT THAT'S WHAT I HAVE PAID FOR IS PAID TO MAKE THESE BIG DECISIONS FOR THE ENGLAND TEAM AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THAT PROBLEM I THINK IT'S GREAT HE'S GOT VOIDING CAME TO THESE FANTASTIC PLAYERS
TOOK THE SEASON BY STORM CANES JUST REINFORCED THEIR BELIEF THAT WE HAD IN HIM FROM THE FIRST SEASON SHUT EVERYBODY UP SHOT EVERYBODY DOWN IN THAT'S IN THAT RESPECT AND THAT HIS QUOTE FOR ENGLISH FOOTBALL BUT WE'VE GOT TWO PLAYERS WERE VERY DIFFERENT WHICH IS A GREAT GREAT THING AS WELL AND BACKED UP BY SOMEONE LIKE ROONEY IT'S A GREAT THING AND REPLAYS DIFFERENT POSITIONS WE CAN WE CAN DO THAT IS THAT TALENTED
YEAH THE THING IS WHEN YOU HAVE PLAYERS OF WAYNE ROONEY STATURE YOU'RE GOING TO DIVIDE OPINION YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE DEBATE AROUND AROUND HIM AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS AND I'M SURE EXCEPT SO HOW STRONG DO YOU THINK THE DEFENCES WHEN YOU PLAYED YOU PARTNER JOHN TERRY USED TO THE WEAKEST PART OF HIS TIME HE WAS IN THE LAST TOURNAMENT AND IT WORRIES YOU
IT'S A CAUSE FOR CONCERN I'D SAY I THINK IN THE LAST TOURNAMENT THAT WAS A WANDERIN DEFENCE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR NOW YOU COULD SAY IS IT FROM A DEFENSIVE POINT OF VIEW IT WAS THE SHAPE AND IT'S IN GOOD ENOUGH BUT IT PROTECTED ENOUGH IF THAT'S THE WEAKEST PART OF YOUR TEAM THEN MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A PREPARE TO DESCEND THE FORDABLE GETS INTO THEM AREAS SO
THERE ARE QUESTIONS AT THE MANAGER'S GOING TO BE NICE AND SWEET PAID FOR AND HE'S LET HER DO THAT BUT SHE CLOSED WALKER AND ROSE AS THE FULL BAXTER TO VERY ATTACK MINDED PLAYERS
HAS HE GOT EXPERIENCE AS YOU'VE GOT THE DEFENDERS CAN DEAL WITH THAT THEN LEFT ALONE AND A BIT ISOLATED AS A PARENT IN HER BACK IS HE GOING TO BE STONES AND SMALL AND AS YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE IN FOR ONE WHO CAN PROTECT
THE GUY'S DONE IT REALLY WELL FOR FOR SPURS INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL'S DIFFERENT SO HE'S ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS HAVE TO BE ANSWERED IN A TOURNAMENT I WOULD SAY THIS TOURNAMENT IS SHOULD BE LEFT
SEVERE DEVELOPMENT TOURNAMENT ALMOST AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING THIS TO PREPARE A SORT OF COME TOURNAMENT AFTER THE WORLD CUP BECAUSE WE'VE GOT YOUNG PLAYERS IN EXPERIENCED GAME YOU ATE YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE DO THAT AND THEN
RELIEVED THE PRESSURE A LITTLE BIT AND THEN FLOWERS HOPEFULLY WILL GROW AND BOTTOM ATOLL NEXT ON THE COMES AROUND THEY'LL BE READY IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT YOU MAKE A DEVELOPMENT TOURNAMENT IN INTERESTING WORDS SO AS A DEVELOPMENT TOURNAMENT WHAT COULD WE EXPECT
ENGLAND TO DO IN FOR TERMS OF HOW FAR THEY GO JUST JUST PLAY WELL IN THE GROUP MATCHES GET KNOCKED OUT AT THE QUARTERFINAL STAGE AGAIN AGAIN PUT IN STIPULATIONS PUTTING EXPECTATIONS ON IT A WRONG WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS HAD HIS EXPECTATIONS GOING IN WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT'S COMING OUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COME OUT AT ALL WE'VE NEVER HAD A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE COMING OUT OF US ALL STRENGTH
WE COME UP WE COP SO THIS TOURNAMENT I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO COME AND SAY YES I'LL I'LL BE YOUNG PLAYERS HAVE GROWN IN STATURE AND EXPERIENCE EXPOSURE INDIVIDUALLY BUT ALSO COLLECTIVELY AS A TEAM
AND WERE COMING OUT WITH SOME HOPE FOR THE NEXT TOURNAMENT COS WE'VE SEEN SIGNS THAT PROGRESSION
AND WE'VE NOT DONE THAT IN RECENT ORNAMENT IT'S A SENSIBLE SUGGESTION YOU MAKE BUT DO YOU THINK THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION WOULD LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT WHEN THEY CONSIDER WHAT TO DO WITH THE ENGLAND MANAGER ROY HODGSON
WELL I THINK YOU'VE ONLY GOT TO LOOK AT COUNTRIES LIKE FRANCE COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY THERE WAS A TOURNAMENT THAT WAS ALMOST LIKE A SACRIFICIAL LAMB
HE SAID RIGHT THAT TOURNAMENT IS GOING TO BE DRESSED AS A DEVELOPMENT CASE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD AND BUILD ON THAT TOURNAMENT WE'RE GOING TO PAVE HIS TOURNAMENT WAS TO SEE YOU TO THE NEXT ON THE REST OF THE WAY THAT ASKED THEM TO DEM COUNTRIES DONE SPEAKING TO THEIR PLAYERS SPEAKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION

BRITAIN WOULD BE PERMANENTLY POORER IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION TO THE TUNE OF FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POUNDS FOR EVERY HOUSE OILS WE WILL BE BETTER OFFER WE READY RICHARD OF MORE SUCCESSFUL INDEED THREE MILLION PEOPLE'S JOBS IN OUR COUNTRY ARE ALREADY WHAT IS IT
IS THAT WE GIVE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS TO THE EUROPE WELL HAND TRACK THAT WE ARE THE ACCESS POINT TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE MARKET PRODUCES A GREAT HEATHER INVESTMENT IN THIS COUNTRY DON'T HAVE TO HARASS THEM BOTH SIDES CAN EXCEPT THERE IS NO NEED TO ERECT THEM AND THAT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC FOR PEOPLE'S JOBS AND INCOME SEND THEIR LIVELIHOODS FULL FORECASTS WRONG SHE TAKE THEM ALL WITH A PINCH OF SALT WHERE THEY COME FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE I AM
OR ANY OTHER ORGANISATION SO OUT OF THE POOR OLD MOTORS EXPECTED TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS AT THE CAMPAIGN LEADERS CAN'T AGREE ON EVEN THE MOST BASIC FACTS WELL THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN WE ROUNDED UP FOUR OF OUR OWN EDITORS TO PUT YOU STRAIGHT WHAT TO TRY TO PUT YOU STRAIGHT ON FOUR OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS AREAS THEY THE EDITORS THAT IS A COME ON AHMED MARQUEES EASTERN KATYA ADLER AND SIMON JACK AND THE FACTS COME ON COME ON THAT IS OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR
YOUR FACT WE SELL THE E. U. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK THAT IS WHAT THE LEAF CAMPAIGN SAYS IS THAT TRUE
RIGHT WELL I DO LOVE THE WHIFF OF A STATISTICAL CHART IN THE MORNING SO I HAVE BEEN DIGGING THROUGH THE FIGURES BEHIND THIS TO SAVE OUR DEAR LISTENERS FROM HAVING TO DO SUCH A PAINFUL THING TABLE NINE POINT NINE OF THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS PINK BOOK TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT IS GOING TO BE MY START POINT FOR THIS THE BIG POINT TO MAKE I THINK AT THE BEGINNING IS THE U.K. PAYS MORE SORRY IN THE U.K. PAYS MORE INTO THE E.U. IT RECEIVES THAT IS THE BIG FIRST
POINT IS IT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK LET'S SEE
THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK IS OUR GROSS CONTRIBUTION TO THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S JUST OVER NINETEEN BILLION POUNDS BUT WE GET A REBATE FROM THE E.U. LAID BACK BUT HE'S A BIT OF A BIT OF A MISNOMER HERE ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE NEVER PAY THE MONEY IN AND GET THE REBATE WE ACTUALLY GET THE REBATE FIRST AND THEN PAY THE MONEY IN
THAT REBATE IS WORTH FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS A YEAR SO THAT MAKES OUR ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE EUROPEAN UNION FOURTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS A WEEK BUT I KNOW A LOT OF MODERN EUROPE THIS IS EUROPE JOHN GOT TO BE COMPLICATED GOT TO KEEP THOSE BRUSSELS OFFICIALS IN WORK OBVIOUSLY WE ALSO GET
MONEY FROM THE E.U. TO SUPPORT TO THE U.K. ECONOMY FARMING WE GET REGIONAL FUNDS THERE'S SOME MONEY FOR SCIENCE RESEARCH THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION POUNDS
A YEAR SO THAT MAKES HER NETS CONTRIBUTION THAT THE U.K. GIVES TO THE EUROPEAN UNION OF NINE POINT NINE BILLION POUNDS OR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION
A WEEK THAT IS FROM THE OWEN S. STATISTICS RIGHT SO WHEN THEY SAY ON THE SIDE OF THEIR BATTLE BUS EVERY OTHER INTERVIEW THAT YOU DO WITH THEM WE PAY IN THREE HUNDRED FISH COMING COULD WE THAT'S NOT
IS THE GROSS CONTRIBUTION WHICH DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REBATE WE RECEIVE FROM THE E.U. AND THE MONEY WE RECEIVE FROM THE Y. YOU BY WAY OF GRANTS AND SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH AND SIGHTS RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT LET'S TURN TO MARK USED ON A HOME YORK QUESTION QUESTION YOUR STATEMENT IF YOU LIKE MARK
FAMILIES WOULD BE FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POUNDS WORSE OFF BY TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTY THAT IS GEORGE OSBORNE WHO MADE THAT CLAIM THERE REMAIN A CAMP OF COURSE TRUE OR FALSE
RIGHT O.K. I HAVEN'T GOT ANY CHARTS FOR YOU THIS MORNING JOHN BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE TREASURY CLAIM IS BASED ON ON G.D.P. PER HOUSEHOLD WHAT THEY'VE DONE THEY'D FORECAST WHAT THEY THINK G.D.P. WOULD BE IN TWENTY FIRST DOMESTIC PRODUCT ALL THE STUFF THAT WE PRODUCE
WHAT DO YOU DO PETE WOULD BE IN TWENTY THIRTY SO THEY'RE THROWN QUITE A LONG WAY AHEAD AND THEY'VE DONE IT FOR BOTH STAYING IN THE E.U. AND LEAVING THE E.U. AND THEN CALCULATED THE DIFFERENCE BUT G.D.P. PER HOUSEHOLD
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS HOUSEHOLD INCOMES MUCH PEOPLE WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU SIMPLY DIVIDE CURRENT G.D.P. BY THE NUMBER OF BRITISH HOUSEHOLDS YOU GET A FIGURE OF AROUND SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND PER HOUSEHOLD WHAT WE KNOW AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME WE WOULD REGARD AS WHAT MONEY WE'RE GETTING IN AS ABOUT FORTY FOUR FORTY FIVE THOUSAND SO THE THE IDEA OF A COST TO U.K. FAMILIES OF FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED
IT'S NOT COST IN THE WAY THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK OF IT SO WE WON'T ACTUALLY BE WORSE OFF BY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THAT THAT'S THE BALD FACTS KNOW EXACTLY THAT THE TREASURY MODEL DOESN'T SUGGEST U.K. FAMILIES ARE GOING TO BE POORER THAN THEY ARE NOW IN FACT THE MODELLING SUGGEST FAMILIES WILL BE RICHER IN TWENTY THIRTY IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THEY'RE MODEL SUGGESTS WE WOULDN'T BE QUITE AS RICH AS IF WE STAY IN THE E.U. AND THAT'S A DIFFERENCE OF FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED
PER HOUSEHOLD THE LAST POINT I THINK TO BE MADE IS THAT FINANCIAL MODELLING AS WE HEARD IN THE INTRODUCTION THERE IS OBVIOUSLY ONLY AS GOOD AS THE INFORMATION IN THE FORECAST THAT YOU PUT INTO IT AND HOW OFTEN THEY HAVE BEEN PROVED QUITE WRONG ONE ASPECT OF THE MODELLING THAT'S RAISED EYEBROWS IS THAT USES THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS NOW TODAY
TO DIVIDE ESTIMATED G. V. P. FOR TWENTY THIRTY TAKING ACCOUNT OF POPULATION GROWTH OR THE EFFECTS ARE CHANGES TO NET IMMIGRATION THAT'S AND YOU LEAD US NICELY INTO OUR NEXT THOUGHT THEN THE CONTENTIOUS AREA IF YOU LIKE THAT HE'S UP TO
EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE FROM NATIONS MUCH POORER THAN OUR OWN WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORK HERE THAT'S WHAT MICHAEL GOVE SAID IN THE DAILY MAIL JUST OF THE DAY THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN OF COURSE KATYA ADLER IS A EUROPE EDITOR A RIGHT OR WRONG
WELL WELCOME A LIKES TO START THE MORNING ON A SATURDAY WITH STATISTICAL CHARTS I'M QUITE FOND OF CRYSTAL BALL GAZING ON SATURDAY MORNING MYSELF SO IF WE LOOK INTO A CRYSTAL BALL MICHAEL GO FOR HE'S RIGHT THERE ARE FIVE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE STARTED TALKS WITH THE Y. YOU ABOUT BECOMING A MEMBER ONE DAY THAT'S TURKEY ALBANIA MONTENEGRO MACEDONIA AND SERBIA
POPULATION OF ALL THOSE COUNTRIES ROUGHLY ADDS UP TO EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION SO FOR MICHAEL GO TO BE RIGHT THIS WOULD MEAN THAT ALL THE CITIZENS OF THOSE COUNTRIES EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD WOULD HAVE TO MOVE TO THE U.K. IT WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT THE COUNTRY'S ACTUALLY GETTING INTO THE E.U. WHICH IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S DIFFICULT DO YOU
ESPECIALLY WITH TURKEY BUT FOR ANY OF THEM AT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER SAID THERE'LL BE NO NEW MEMBERS IN THE E.U. UNTIL AT LEAST TWENTY TWENTY EVEN THEN THEIR MEMBERSHIP WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY EVERY SINGLE Y. YOU LEADER BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND BY NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS EVERY MATCH EVERY NEW MEMBER HAS TO APPLY ALL E.U. CURRENT RULES BEFORE THEY CAN JOIN THAT'S IN THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT POLICY AREAS AND YOU MENTION THEIR TURKEY OF COURSE TURKEYS
THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL OF THE FIVE AND THE BIGGEST OUT OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION IT'S SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AND TURKEY STARTED ITS TALKS TO JOIN THE E.U. TEN YEARS AGO IN THOSE TEN YEARS IT'S ONLY MANAGED TO ADOPT E.U. RULES ON ONE AREA THAT SCIENCE AND RESEARCH DIFFICULTY WELL WE CAN LOOK AT HUMAN RIGHTS WE CAN LOOK AT LIMITS AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION THE STATE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND VERY KEY FOR THE Y. YOU TURKEY HAS TO RECOGNISE FELLOW E.U. MEMBER CYPRUS
WHICH IT DOESN'T AND THEN IF WE LOOK AT THE POLITICS OF THE E.U. THESE DAYS JOHN AS WELL WE'VE GOT POPULIST PARTIES DOING VERY WELL IN MANY COUNTRIES ACROSS THE E.U. FEARS OF MIGRATION DOMINATING POLITICS SO NO ONE REALLY IS TRUMPETING THE CASE FOR TURKEY'S MEMBERSHIP AT THE MALL RIGHT KATYA THANK YOU FOR THAT AND A FINAL QUESTION THREE MILLION JOBS ARE LINKED TO THE EUROPEAN UNION THIS IS ACCORDING TO DAVID CAMERON SIMON JACK A BUSINESS OUT OF IT IS THAT RIGHT
YES BUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT THREE MILLION JOBS WOULD GO IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ABSOLUTELY NOT THERE ARE TWO PIECES OF WORK DONE ON THIS ONE WAS BY THE SOUTH BANK IT'S DUE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WAS HER JUST OVER THREE MILLION THERE'S A NEW PIECE OF WORK OUT LAST YEAR BY THE SCENT OF RECKON THERE'S RESEARCH WHICH PUTS IT AT OVER FOUR MILLION NOW OBVIOUSLY THOSE JOBS ARE LINKED WITH THE TRADE
NO ONE OR SIX ASSUMES THAT THE TRADE WOULD DISAPPEAR GO UP IN SMOKE THE DAY WE LEFT WHICH THEN PUTS US INTO THIS RATHER EXPOSITION OF LOOKING A WHAT A TRADE WOULD LOOK LIKE AND YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THE SWISS MODELLED THE NORWAY MODEL THE W.T.O. EVEN THE ALBANIAN MODEL BUT THE RULE OF THUMB BASICALLY IS THAT THE MORE INDEPENDENT OF THE U.K. GETS THE LESS ACCESS YOU GET TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT THAT IS THE TRADE OFF SO IN THE SWISS MODEL FOR EXAMPLE BANKS ARE ALLOWED TO SELL SWISS BANKS
STATIONED HERE CAN SELL THROUGHOUT THE REST OF EUROPE THEY CAN'T SELL FROM SWITZERLAND THE SYSTEM CALLED PASSPORT SO WE WOULD SEE POTENTIALLY SOME JOBS IN THE CITY HAD A CHAT WITH THE BOSS A BOP IS THE OTHER DAY HE SAID WITH THIS THREATEN LONDON'S PLACES THE PRE WENT FINANCIAL CENTRE NO WOULD IT MAKE LIFE A BIT MORE DIFFICULT YES SO BASICALLY THREE TO FOUR MILLION JOBS OR ASSOCIATION WITH TRADE NOT WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
HOW MANY JOBS WOULD GO DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ACTORS YOU GET AND WHAT MODEL YOU THINK WHICH MODEL WOULD ERODE SOME OF THAT TRADE AND THAT OF COURSE IS A JUDGEMENT WHERE THERE AREN'T ANY SETTLED FACT AND EVEN THE ALBANIAN MODEL MICHAEL GO
WANTED THE ALBANIAN PRIME MINISTER THOUGHT HE THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT WEIRD THAT THE U.K. WANTED THAT SO I'M AFRAID THE BITS THAT WERE HIS VERY WORDS SURVEYED THE CHAT ABOUT THE DIFFERENT MODELS WILL CONTINUE WHEN IT COMES TO HOW MANY JOBS ARE AT RISK AND SO WILL THIS DEBATE SIMON CAT HERE MARK AND THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH I THINK WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT NONE NOT ONE OF THOSE FOUR CLAIMS
HAVE BEEN STOOD UP BY OUR EDITORS COMMANDS NODDING AT THAT SO I'LL TAKE THAT THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH INDEED WE MAY VERY WELL RETURN TO THIS OVER THE WEEKS TO COME
THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE MANY AMERICAN SUPPORT THE DEATH PENALTY AND DO THE MAJORITY OF THEM DO BUT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS WHO ARE OPPOSED AND IN RECENT YEARS THEY'VE FELT THAT THE WIND IS IN THEIR SAILS A NUMBER OF SENTENCES OF DEATH AND THE NUMBER OF EXECUTIONS ARE BOTH FALLING NOW WITH THE DECISION OF THE U.S. DRUG SPERM PFIZER TO STOP SUPPLYING THE DRUGS THAT CAN BE USED IN EXECUTIONS EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE DONE THE SAME
IT'S GETTING QUITE TRICKY FOR STATES TO GO AHEAD WITH LETHAL INJECTIONS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO BRIAN STEVENSON WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE EQUAL JUSTICE INITIATIVE IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA I THINK IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING I THINK IT'S COMMENDABLE I DON'T THINK THAT CORPORATIONS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS
UNTIL SHALL JUSTICE SHOULD BE COMPLICIT IN THE GRISLY BUSINESS OF EXECUTING PEOPLE AND WE'LL HAVE A REAL IMPACT IT WELL I MEAN I DO THINK THAT THE ISOLATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES IN DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE EXECUTION CRISIS IN AMERICA
AS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT DISRUPTED THE ABILITY OF THE ESTATES TO CARRY OUT THESE EXECUTIONS WERE RESISTANCE AND I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE THING THERE ARE CHALLENGES IN THE U.S. IN GETTING THE DRUGS NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT HIS EXECUTIONS I THINK THAT JUST SENDS A SIGNAL THAT THERE IS A CRITICISM AND RESISTANCE AND CONCERNED ABOUT A DEATH PENALTY PROCESS THAT EXPLOITS ADVANCES IN MODERN MEDICINE AND SCIENCE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE
AND USING THOSE ADVANCES TO KILL PEOPLE IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE DEATH PENALTY IS ON THE RETREAT AND PARTICULARLY IF YOU LOOK AT U.S. STATES OUTSIDE TEXAS WHICH IS A BIT OF A BIT OF AN OUTLIER ISN'T IT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES IS THAT A FAIR THING TO SAY I THINK EVEN IN TAXES WE HAVE HAD A DRAMATIC DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS THAT IS ON THAT STAGE AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION THAT THE NUMBER OF DEATH SENTENCES AS DOWN DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS
AS IS THE EXECUTION RATE WE'VE HAD EIGHT STATES REPEALED THE DEATH PENALTY IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION THAT THE TREND IS CERTAINLY AWAY FROM THE DEATH PENALTY
IT'S STILL THERE SO A LOT OF STATES THAT ARE IMPOSING GUS CENTRES AND TRIED TO EXECUTE PEOPLE SO THERE ARE STILL GREAT CHALLENGES BUT I DO THINK WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND POLITICALLY BECAUSE IT'S INTERESTING ISN'T IT THE BERNIE SANDERS THE DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER DID TO HILLARY CLINTON IS HE'S AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY WHICH IS UNUSUAL TO PUT IT MILDLY FOR HER AS A SENIOR AMERICAN POLITICIAN SOMEONE COMPETING FOR THE PRESIDENCY TO BE SO OPEN FORTY YEARS AGO
AN ABSENCE OF SUPPORT FOR THE DEATH PENALTY WOULD HAVE DOOMED TO POLITICAL CAREER I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE ANY MORE WE HAVE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS EXPRESS RESERVATIONS ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WE CERTAINLY HAVE PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES THAT OUR ENTIRE DEATH PENALTY I NO LONGER THINK I GOT SUPPORT FOR THE DEATH PENALTY IS ESSENTIAL
FOR SOMEONE TO GET ELECTED TO PUBLIC OFFICE BUT IT IS STILL SUPPORTED BY THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS ISN'T IT AND PLENTY OF AMERICANS WHO BELIEVE LOOK IT'S PERFECTLY WHEN IT'S WHEN WE GET THE RIGHT PERSON AND IN AWFUL AWFUL CASES WHERE A CRIME HAS BEEN REALLY GHASTLY IT IS STILL RIGHT THAT WE HAVE THAT EXECUTION POSSIBILITY AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S ALSO TRUE IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THE DEATH PENALTY WAS ABOLISHED AND IN MANY PARTS OF EUROPE DESPITE
BUT THERE WAS MAJORITY SUPPORT FOR IT I THINK THE CHALLENGE OF LEADERSHIP THE CHALLENGE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT THE CHALLENGE OF THE DANCING YOU IN RIGHT
IS TO INSIST ON THOSE RIGHTS EVEN WHERE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY RECOGNISED THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT COMMITMENT I'M THE PRODUCT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN YOU COULD GET THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE I LIVE TO END SEGREGATION
BUT IT WAS URGENT AN ESSENTIAL AND NECESSARY AND RIGHT THAT SEGREGATION AND DESPITE THE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR IT IN THE REGION OF THE COUNTRY WHERE I LIVE AND I THINK THAT THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE DEATH PENALTY IT IS A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS NEEDS TO SPEND EVEN HERE
WITHOUT IT PEOPLE THINK IT'S SOMEHOW IMPORTANT AND A LEGITIMATE BRYAN STEVENSON THANKS VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US
THE TIME IS NO EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS MORE ABSENCES UNLESS DONE ABOUT IT THAT'S THE PREDICTION FROM ONE EXPERT TALKING TO THE TIMES ABOUT YESTERDAY'S RULING ON PARENTS TAKING THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL THE HIGH COURT UPHELD THE ARGUMENT OF ONE FARTHER FROM THE ISLE OF WIGHT THAT HE WAS ONLY REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE HIS DAUGHTER ATTENDED REGULARLY NOT NECESSARILY EVERY DAY
THE EYES ONE OF MANY PAPERS CALLING A LANDMARK RULING THE MALE CALLS IT A BIG BLUE BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S CRACKDOWN ON UNAPPROVED ABSENCE ISN'T SAYS THEY COULD NOW BE A RUSH OF FAMILIES LOOKING FOR CHEAP HOLIDAYS THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THOUSANDS OF PARENTS ARE POISED TO HAVE THEIR FINDS REFUNDED BUT THERE ARE WORDS OF CAUTION FROM THE SUN IT SAYS JOHN PLAITS COURT VICTORY SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO CHARLES EDUCATION COMES BEFORE SAVING A FEW QUID THE SUN ARGUES ADDING BRIGHT KIDS MAKE CATCH UP FROM A NON AUTHORISED WEEK OFF OTHERS WON'T HAVE ANY MIRRORS ALISON PHILIPS SAYS
FLOUTING RULES AND THEN REFUSING TO ACCEPT PENALTIES A DREADFUL EXAMPLE TO SET HER CHILD AND SAYS THAT WHEN SHE WAS FINE FOR TAKING HER CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL SHE ACTUALLY PUTS IT SUCKED IT UP THE MIRROR SAYS IT WON'T BE A VICTORY FOR LONG AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS VOWED TO TIGHTEN THE LAW IT SAYS IT SHOULD BE A COMMON SENSE LAW GIVING HEAD TEACHERS MORE FLEXIBILITY
THERE ARE MARKS THE DEATH OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST PERSON THE LAST AMERICAN TO BE BORN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SUSANNAH MUCH HAD JOAN WAS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF SLAVES HE WAS ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN WHEN SHE WAS BORN SAYS THE MINUTE QUEEN VICTORIA WAS STILL A THROW AND SHE LIVED THROUGH TWENTY AMERICAN PRESIDENCIES THE TIMES HEARS FROM THE FAMILY OF THE NEW RECORD HOLDER EMMA MERANO NOW THE ONLY LIVING PERSON BORN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THEY SAY SHE'S REALLY HAPPY TO TAKE ON THE MANTLE THE TELEGRAPH
CALLS OF THE LAST LIVING LINK TO THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS AND REVEALS THE SECRET TO HER LONGEVITY SHE SAYS IT IS THREE THREE EGGS A DAY TO HAVE THEM RAW WHICH IS EATEN EVERY DAY SINCE SHE HAD ANAEMIA WHEN SHE WAS TWENTY SHE ALSO EAT SMALL QUANTITIES OF RAW MINCED MEAT AND HAS ONLY MILK FOR SUPPER
THA'S HOMELESS TONIGHT IF YOU DON'T LIVE FOR EVER IT WILL FEEL LIKE IT I THINK THE BIG FASHION STORY OF THE WEEK HAS BEEN A HIGH HEELS IT'S NOT REALLY A FASHION STORY AT ALL IT'S ABOUT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT SHE WEARS TO WORK OR NOT BE ORDERED BY HER BOSSES IT ALL STARTED BECAUSE NICOLA FOR YOUNG ACTRESS DOING A TEMPORARY JOB AS A RECEPTIONIST
A BIG ACCOUNTANCY FIRM TURNED UP ON HER FIRST DAY WEARING FLAT SHOES AND WAS ORDERED TO LEAVE SHE GOT UP A PETITION OR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SIGNED IT WHICH MEANS PARLIAMENT NO LESS HAS TO CONSIDER HOLDING A DEBATE ON IT LET'S HAVE OUR OWN DEBATE WITH DOCTOR ALISON BANCROFT VISITING PROFESSOR IN FASHION AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SHE SPECIALISES IN THE PSYCHO CULTURAL STUDY OF FASHION AND AMBER BUTCHER OUT FASHION HISTORIAN AN ASSOCIATE LECTURER AT THE LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION ALISON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS
GOOD MORNING MORNING
IT'S PREPOSTEROUS I'LL PUT SIMPLY THE IDEA THAT
THERE SHOULD BE JET AND FORCED GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CLOTHING THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE MADE TO WEAR SOMETHING THAT MEN ARMED
IS ABSURD IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PARTICULARLY SO WITH SOMETHING LIKE HIGH HEELS WHICH LOVELY THOUGH THEY ARE AND I'M WEARING A VERY NICE PAIR TODAY I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE NOTHING YES NOTHING WRONG WITH HIGH HEELS BUT IF YOU'RE ON YOUR FEET ALL DAY FOR EIGHT OR NINE HOURS
NOT A GREAT CHOICE AND THEY WILL CAUSE YOU PHYSICAL HARM SO TO FORCE A WOMAN TO WEAR HIGH HEELS AT WORK
IS A RIDICULOUS STATE OF AFFAIRS AND YOU AGREE WITH THAT THOUGH YOU'RE WEARING FLAT HEELS ACTUALLY YOU'RE WEARING TAP DANCE SHOES I HAMMERING TAP DANCES WHICH ARE THEY DO YOU HAVE A SMALL HEEL ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF BUT IT'S A WIDE HEEL IT'S NOT A STILETTO HEEL WHICH I BELIEVE WAS THE TYPE OF HAIL IT WAS TRYING TO BE ENFORCED ON NICOLA THOUGHT YEAH OF COURSE I COMPLETELY AGREE I CAN'T AGREE THAT IT'S A DAFT THING TO DO AGREE THAT IT'S A DAFT THING TO DO I CAN'T SEE THAT ANYBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE POLICY TO BE ENFORCING
IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AS ALISON SETS BUT ALISON IF SHE HAD SHE WAS A RECEPTIONIST RIGHT AND THE VET THOUGHT REPRESENTED THE FACE OF THE COMPANY I SUPPOSE YOU'D SAY WOULDN'T YOU IF SHE'D TURNED UP FOR WORK WEARING I DON'T KNOW DUNGAREES OR SOMETHING WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN RIPPED UP THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER CHOICE WELL I DON'T THINK
ANY ONE WOULD BE WEARING DUNGAREES AND FRONT OF HOUSE POSITION IN A BLUE CHIP COMPANY LIKE PRICE FOR A HOUSE THAT SAYS POINT ISN'T IT SO IF THEY HAVE A DRESS CODE WHICH SAYS THAT WOMEN WEAR I DON'T KNOW PENCIL SKIRTS AND THE HIGH HEELS OR SOMETHING AREN'T THEY ENTITLED TO MAKE THAT
I THINK IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DRESS CODE IT SHOULD BE
A LONG PROFESSIONAL LINE SO IT'S REQUIRED TO BE SMART CLEAN NO PRINTS MODEST COLOURS DARK BLUE GREY BLACK WHATEVER
BUT I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE GENDERED AND THERE WAS A CASE IN TWO THOUSAND TO WHERE A GIRL SUED HER SCHOOL OVER THE RIGHT TO WEAR TROUSERS AND THE SCHOOL EVENTUALLY BACKED DOWN BEFORE THE CASE GOT TO COURT SHE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES COMMISSION ALSO WANTED A BOY WHO WANTED TO WEAR A SKIRT YES I BUT I I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A BOY HE WANTED TO WEAR A SKIRT BUT IF A BOY WANTS TO WEAR A SKIRT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE FAIR QUOTE BUT BUT NONETHELESS YOU'RE SAYING IT'S A BAD RIDER AND YOU AGREE WITH THAT BUT WHAT DOES HISTORY TELL US ABOUT THIS HISTORY FASHION WELL IT'S QUITE INTERESTING THE WAY THAT HEALS HAVE BEEN TENDED THROUGHOUT HISTORY WE'VE WE'VE EVEN TODAY IS A VERY FEMALE
BUT HISTORICALLY THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY BEEN THE CASE THEY WERE INITIALLY WORN BY MEN BY A HORSE RIDING MEN AS GOOD FOR PRACTICAL REASONS AS A PRACTICAL ITEM
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL MONARCHS PEOPLE LIKE LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH WERE VERY VERY KEEN ON HIGH HEELS HE WAS A DANCER
WEARING RED HIGH HEELS WOULD REALLY SHOW OFF HIS DANCER'S LEGS WHICH IS VERY PROUD OF AND IT WAS A REAL SIGN OF STATUS OF THE REALITY OF MASCULINITY AT THIS TIME TO BE WEARING HEELS AND YOU COULD ONLY WEAR THEM IF YOU WERE A MEMBER OF LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH VERY SELECT PASS COURT AT VERSAILLES HOWEVER WHAT TENDS TO BE THE CASE WHEN YOU GET WOMEN WEARING HEELS THROUGHOUT HISTORY IS THEY BECOME ASSOCIATED NOT WITH VIRILITY AND STRENGTH
BUT WITH A SORT OF A CERTAIN IMMOBILITY AND STATUS THROUGH THAT THE IDEA OF LEISURE BEING THE PREROGATIVE OF WEALTHY WOMEN RIGHT ALISON YOU'RE WEARING HIGH HEELS THIS MORNING BECAUSE YOU CHOOSE TO WRITE YES THIS WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO UP I THOUGHT I'VE NEVER WORN HIGH HEELS I DON'T KNOW BUT I IMAGINE THEY MUST BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT THEY'RE ALL RIGHT IF YOU'RE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME SITTING DOWN
AND I ARRIVED BY CAR THIS MORNING I WALKED IN THE STUDIO AND WHEN I FINISH I'M GOING TO BE DOING SOME WORK IN THE BRITISH LIBRARY THIS AFTERNOON SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE DOING A VAST AMOUNT OF WALKING IF I WAS SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON MY FEET IF ANYBODY WAS SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON THEIR FEET THEY WOULDN'T WEAR THE SORT RIGHT I WAS TRYING TO BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT YOU'RE NOT WEARING HIGH HEELS BECAUSE IT APPEALS TO OTHER PEOPLE WHETHER IT'S TO OTHER MEN OR TO OTHER WOMEN
WHETHER YOU LOOK NICE I MEAN I DID IT AND I'M COMPLETELY SUBJECT WHETHER YOU LOOK LIGHTER WEARING HIGH HEELS THIS IDEA THAT WOMEN WEAR CLOTHING FULL OF THEIR PEOPLE THOUGHT FOUR OF THE MEN OR THE WOMEN
I DON'T FIND THAT TERRIBLY COMPELLING I TAKE THE VIEW
THE SORRY VERY QUICK THOUGHT FROM YOU ON THAT WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME DONE I THINK MAYBE IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GAVE IT A GO THE HEIDI LAST WEEK THAT MEALS WE'VE LOST SOME AMAZING ALL THAT TALK STATUS HAS GOT IT THINK ABOUT MEN LIKE DAVID BOWIE PRAYING IF YOU MAKE A POINT I WOULD HAVE PURSUED THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE OUT OF TIME I'M HAPPY TO SAY IT'S AND THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH IN HARBIN ADAM COME MORNING
