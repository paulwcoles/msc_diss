THANK YOU LOUISE IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THE PAPERS B.H.S. S.O.S. IS THE HEADLINE ON THE DAILY MIRROR'S FRONT PAGE CRISIS ON THE HIGH STREET HIGHLIGHTING THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS THOSE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR SHOPS AS WELL AND QUOTING THE LETTER FROM THE BOSS OF B.H.S. DOMINIC CHAPEL WHO SAID TO WORKERS IN THE LETTER IT IS WITH A HOT THAT I HAVE TO REPORT THAT FORGIVE ME THAT I HAVE TO REPORT DESPITE A MASSIVE EFFORT FROM THE TEAM
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE A THUNDER OR A TRADE SALE NOW IN THE MIRRORS REPORT ALSO IN THE GUARDIAN'S REPORT IF THERE'S LOT OF FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF PHILIP GREEN THE MEN OF COURSE SOLD B.H.S. FOR CHESTER POUND A RETAILER HIGHLIGHTING THAT HE'D MADE AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY FROM THE STORE AND IS NOW BEING ASKED TO PAY FOR THEIR PENSION DEFICIT WHICH IS THE REAL REASON THAT THE B.H.S. CHAINED CAN'T BE SOLD HE APPARENTLY HAS OFFERED TO PAY UP TO EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS BUT THE PENSIONS REGULATOR WANTS MORE MONEY FROM IT
THE OTHER BIG STORY IS THE JUNIOR DOCTOR STRIKE THE MAIL'S HEADLINE DON'T GET SICK TOMORROW TWO EXCLAMATION MARK IT SAYS JUNIOR DOCTORS WILL CARRY OUT THE FIRST ALL OUT STRIKE IN HISTORY AFTER THE MEDICAL UNION REFUSED TO MEET JEREMY HUNT THE GUARDIAN'S TAKE ON IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IT'S HEADLINE ON THE STORY AND THEY JUST TRIED TO GO AHEAD AS HUNT REJECTS COMPROMISE IT ALSO IT SAYS ITS NEW SILVER HAS NEW SURVEY FINDING SHARED WITH THE GUARDIAN
SUGGEST A LARGE MAJORITY OF JUNIOR DOCTOR ENGLAND WILL TAKE PART IN THE STOPPAGE IN SPITE OF WARNINGS FROM THE PROFESSIONS REGULATOR THE G.M.C. THERE'S ATTEMPTED TO FIGHT BACK BY THE BRICKS IT CAMPAIGNERS AFTER WHAT THEY ACKNOWLEDGE HAVE BEEN A PRETTY DIFFICULT WEEP WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA OF COURSE BACK IN THE CASE FOR STAYING IN SO THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES HAS THE HEADLINE GUV LAUNCHES BRICKS IT FIGHT BACK
IN WHICH THE JUSTICE SECRETARY WARNS OF AND I QUOTE A DIRECT AND SERIOUS THREAT TO PUBLIC SERVICES LIVING STANDARDS AND HARMONY IF OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING ALBANIA IN TURKEY OR TO JOIN YOU BORIS JOHNSON IN HIS COLUMN IS DEFIANT AND GOES BACK TO THAT RENEGOTIATION HE SAID THE PRIME MINISTER ASKED THE E.U. FOR REFORM AND GOT TWO THIRDS OF DIDDLY SQUAT THAT DEAL SHOWS HOW CONTEMPTUOUSLY WILL BE TREATED IF WE REMAIN THE MALE HAS
TOP TIPS FROM THE QUEEN'S PARTY PLANNERS IN FIFTY YEARS OF PLANNING PARTIES FOR THE QUEEN SHE'S ENJOYED THE COMPANY OF SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST INTERESTING AND INFLUENTIAL GUESTS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE WITHOUT WHOSE CONVERSATIONAL SKILLS MAY BE SOMEWHAT LACKING HER PARTY PLANET LADY ELIZABETH ANSON HAS ONE RULE
SIT THEM ALTOGETHER IF YOU PUT ALL THE BOARDING GUESTS AT THE SAME TABLE APPARENTLY THEY WON'T REALISE THEY'RE BORING UNLESS THEY SPOT ANOTHER BORING PERSON AND THINK THEY CLEARLY THINK I'M GETTING A BIT TECHNICAL
IT'S FANTASTIC
THE GROUP OF NURSERIES AND CHILD CARE ORGANISATIONS IS WARNING THAT PARENTS WILL NEED TO GIVE UP WORK TO LOOK AFTER THEIR CHILDREN IF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GET RID OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR NURSERY STAFF TO HAVE AT LEAST A C. IN G.C.S.E. ENGLISH AND MATHS THAT IS WHAT TERM A CHARITABLE ORGANISATION THE LONDON EARLY YEARS FOUNDATION IS SAYING OUR CORRESPONDENT HER EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT IS ROBERT PIGGOTT ROBERT THIS QUALIFICATION CAME IN LAST SEPTEMBER AND IT'S BEGINNING TO BITE IT SEEMS
THAT'S RIGHT YES FROM SEPTEMBER THESE PEOPLE WILL NEED GCS AND ENGLISH AND MATHS FULL GHQ IN ORDER TO BE COUNTED TOWARDS THE FULL COMPLEMENT OF STAFF A SCHOOL HAS TO HAVE IN ORDER TO MEET THE STATUTORY MINIMUM RATIO OF STAFF TO CHILDREN SO THESE ARE QUITE STRICTLY APPLIED RATIOS THE SCHOOL HAS TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE MEMBER OF STAFF TO FREE
THREE ONE YEAR OLDS FOR EXAMPLE ONE MEMBER STOPPED EVERY FORTY YEAR OLDS WERE MEMBER TO EVERY EIGHT THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS AND DOES THIS APPLY TO THOSE LITTLE NURSERIES YOU SEE ALL OVER THE PLACE THAT TAKE ONLY SMALL CHILDREN PRE SCHOOL CHILDREN THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM DOES IT
IT'S GOING TO PLAY THEY HAVE THERE WILL BE SOME EXCEPTIONS WILL PIE GENERALLY AND I THINK THAT THE THEORIES FOR THE THE THE INCOMING REQUITE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE THE EXTRA THIRTY FREE HOURS OF CHILDCARE A WEEK PROMISE FROM NEXT YEAR TO PARENTS OF THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS SO THERE'S A NEW WAVE OF CHILDREN COMING IN AND A LOT OF THESE OTHER SCHOOLS HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN PROVIDE THAT EXTRA FREE TIME AND THEY SAY THAT ALREADY THEY'RE HAVING A BIG PROBLEM RECRUITING PEOPLE THEY SAY THIS WILL BE A HUGE BARRIER
AND THEY SAY THAT THERE COULD AS THE RESULTS AS YOU MENTIONED BE SITUATION WHICH WORKING MUMS WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP WORK IN ORDER TO LOOK AFTER THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THIS SQUEEZE ON STAFF AND THEY SAY THIS ORGANISATION THAT THERE'S BEEN A NINETY SIX PERCENT DROP IN APPRENTICES AT NURSERIES
YES THE PROBLEM FOR THEM IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN TAKING PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD SOMETHING CALLED FUNCTIONAL SKILLS INSTEAD OF GCS NOW THESE ARE THE ALTERNATIVE QUALIFICATION OFTEN TO OFFERED TO FORTY PER CENT OF STUDENTS WHO DON'T ACHIEVE THESE SORT OF BENCHMARK SEA KRAITS AGGGH SCHOOL NOW FUNCTIONAL GREAT IF YOU GET THE TOP GRADE YOU'RE GUESSING EQUIVALENT TO A C. AT GHQ THEY DO INCLUDE MATHS AND ENGLISH
BUT THEY'RE NOT CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO BE UP TO THE SAME STANDARD METHOD NURSERY SCHOOLS TO SAVE OUR SCHOOLS OUR EARLY YEARS CAMPAIGN IS SAYING THAT THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH THEY GIVE ENOUGH MATHS AND ENGLISH TO DO THIS PARTICULAR JOB AND THEY SAY THEY ALSO GOOD SOFT SKILLS AND THINGS LIKE CARING COMMUNICATION SO ACTUALLY THEY'RE PERFECTLY GOOD WE HAD SOME LEADERS OF SCHOOLS VERY SUCCESSFUL ONES COMING OUT I THINK WELL I NEVER GOT G.C.S.E. IN ENGLISH AND MATHS BUT I'M DOING THE JOB PERFECTLY WELL ROBERT THANKS A LOT
IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES AFTER SIX O'CLOCK PRESENT OBAMA MAY HAVE LEFT THE U.K. BUT THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE JOINING HIM TODAY ALONG WITH THE OTHER LEADERS OF THE SO CALLED G. FIVE NOT JUST THE U.S. AND U.K. BUT GERMANY FRANCE AND ITALY TO TALK TAKE PLACE IN HANOVER IN GERMANY JENNY HILL JOINS US FROM THERE JUST BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE AGENDA JENNY WE'VE HAD G. TWENTY AND G. SEVEN AND G.EIGHT WHAT IT MEANT TO BE THE FUNCTION OF THE G. FIVE
WHILE THIS IF YOU LIKE IS A RATHER INFORMAL MEETING BUT THAT THE PURPOSE IS TO SPEAK PREDOMINANTLY ABOUT THE MIGRANT CRISIS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE OTHER LEADERS WILL GET TOGETHER TO DISCUSS PERHAPS MORE MARINE PATROL'S FOR EXAMPLE OFF THE COAST OF LIBYA SO THE INVOLVEMENT OF NATO
TO PREVENT ANOTHER WAVE OF REFUGEES HEADING INTO EUROPE THIS SUMMER THAT OF COURSE IS A SUBJECT CLOSE TO MY HEART AS WE'VE SEEN THROUGH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VISIT TO GERMANY SO FAR HE'S PRETTY KEEN TO PROP HER UP HE SAID YESTERDAY THAT AS FAR AS HER MIGRANT POLICY IS CONCERNED MISSUS MERKEL IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY
HE PLEDGED HIS SUPPORT FOR WHAT REMAINS OF HIS TIME TO TRY AND HELP HER AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES MIGRANTS COMING INTO EUROPE AND TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT HER LEADERSHIP IN EUROPE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS GIVEN SUPPORT
BEAR IN MIND MISTER OBAMA DOES WANT SOMETHING BACK AND THAT'S ALSO EXPECTED TO BE DISCUSSED THIS AFTERNOON AND THAT SUPPORT FOR HIS FREE TRADE AGREEMENT T. THE TRANSATLANTIC TRADE AND INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP HE REALLY WANTS TO SEAL THIS DEAL BEFORE THE END OF HIS TERM HE WANTS THE OF MISSUS MERKEL MISSUS MERKEL'S IN A TRICKY POSITION BECAUSE THE GERMAN PUBLIC REALLY DON'T WANT THIS DEAL JENNY QUICK ONE WHICH IS IF YOU'RE TALKING MIGRATION INEVITABLY YOU END UP TALKING ABOUT LIBYA AND WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE MILITARY INTERVENTION
YESTERDAY IN A PRESS CONFERENCE MY BARMAN MISSUS MICHAEL TOUCHED ON THIS THEY TALKED IN VERY BROAD TERMS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO GIVE MORE SUPPORT TO THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT TRYING TO STEP UP THOSE PATROLS OF THE COAST THEY DIDN'T GO FOR AS FAR AS TO TALK ABOUT MILITARY INTERVENTION
ON THAT POINT THOUGH WORTH POINTING OUT THAT MY OBAMA HAS NOW COMMITTED TO INCREASING TROOPS IN SYRIA BUT THIS MORNING HE'S TOLD THE WASHINGTON POST THAT THAT WILL BE SOME TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY U.S. TROOPS BEING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF U.S. TROOPS IN THE IN THE COUNTRY TWO TO THREE HUNDRED JENNY HILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
QUARTER PAST SIX THE BIG BUSINESS STORY OF THE DAY IS OF COURSE THE FUTURE IF IT HAS ONE OF B.H.S. TANYA WELL THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING JOHN YES IT COULD FILE SO IT SEEMS FOR ADMINISTRATION AS EARLY AS TODAY THIS OF COURSE THREATENING ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS WITH ME IS GEORGE MCDONALD IS EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF RETAIL WEEK
WHICH HAD OF COURSE THE STORY ON FRIDAY SO GEORGE NOTHING POSITIVE HAS TRANSPIRED OVER THE WEEKEND NO OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE PULLED THE RABBIT OUT THE HAT OVER THE WEEKEND THEY HAVEN'T MANAGED TO DO THAT SO THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT IT WILL GO INTO ADMINISTRATION MIDMORNING TODAY ABOUT HALF PAST TEN ELEVEN O'CLOCK I THINK IT WILL ALL BE FORMALISED
AND THAT MEANS WHAT THAT THE CREDITORS COME TOGETHER AND THEY DECIDE HOW TO WIND DOWN THE BUSINESS SUCH THAT ANY VALUE CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM IT BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT VALUE WAS IN IT WELL YES THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION IT'S STRUGGLED FOR MANY YEARS JUST LAST MONTH HE UNDERTOOK A RESTRUCTURING THE HOPE WAS TO BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO THE BRAND THAT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A BIG CHALLENGE WHAT WE ALSO NEEDED IN ORDER TO DO THAT WAS CASH
AND THEY HAVEN'T MANAGED TO RAISE THE MONEY THEY HOPE TO TO INVEST IN THE BUSINESS BUT YOU KNOW A VERY FAMOUS NAME NEARLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD BUT IT HAS FOUND LIFE VERY HARD FOR MANY YEARS AND WAS DOING WRONG WHAT'S IT BEEN DOING WRONG ON THE HIGH STREET
WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE SORTS OF CHANGES THAT HAVE GONE ON PARTICULARLY THE GROWTH OF ONLINE RETAIL AND THE RURAL ALLSORTS OF MORE POWERFUL COMPETITORS NOW IN SHOPS AS WELL YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT BUSINESS IT'S LIKE PRIMARK SO A VERY VERY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT THE RETAIL SCENE IN GENERAL IS QUITE TOUGH PEOPLE WHO SHOP IN NEW WAYS ALL THOSE THINGS HAVE CONSPIRED TO HIT B.H.S. WHICH HADN'T REALLY KEPT UP WITH THE TIMES
O.K. LET'S TURN TO THE FINANCES AS WE KNOW THERE ARE ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF DEBT JOHN RALPH IS JOINING US NOWT DOWN THE LINE WELCOME TO YOU JOHN AND YOU CAN TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PENSION DEFICIT NOW THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION WHAT'S INTRIGUING ABOUT THIS IS IT THERE'S NOTHING INTRIGUING ABOUT IT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PENSIONS OBVIOUSLY BUT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW IF WHO IS GOING TO PLUG THAT DEFICIT PHILIP GREEN IS STILL ON THE HOOK
YES CERTAINLY MY READING HE OR SOLD THE BUSINESS A YEAR AGO FOR A POUND YES THAT'S RIGHT TANYA ALTHOUGH HE SOLD THE BUSINESS A YEAR AGO FOR A POUND IT WASN'T A QUESTION OF WITH ONE BOUND HE IS FREE PENSION REGULATIONS ARE SET UP TO PREVENT COMPANIES DUMPING THEIR PENSION SCHEMES I'M NOT SUGGESTING FOR A MOMENT BUT THAT'S WHAT'S A FILLET DID
BUT THIS CERTAINLY A PRIMER FACE A CASE TO BE ANSWERED AND I'M VERY CLEAR BASED ON WHAT THE PENSION REGULATOR HAS DONE IN THE PAST THAT THE REGULATOR WILL BE PREPARED TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT AND MONEY
TAKING A CLAIM THROUGH THE COURTS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS IS A HUGE AMOUNT WHAT COULD THIS MEAN IT'S ALREADY IN THE PROTECTION FUNDERS NO WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT BUT WHAT COULD THIS MEAN FOR PEOPLE NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY RETIRED AND CLAIMING THEIR PENSIONS BECAUSE THEY THEIR PENSIONS AS I UNDERSTAND IT REMAIN INTACT BUT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN PAYING INTO THE PENSION FUND AND ARE ABOUT TO RETIRE THINGS COULD BE DIFFICULT
YES THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE PENSION SCHEME THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T YET RETIRED WILL SEE AN IMMEDIATE REDUCTION IN THEIR PENSION OF TEN PER CENT BUT FOR THOSE PEOPLE AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY RETIRED THE RULES OF THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND COMPENSATION
MEAN THAT THE ANNUAL INFLATION PROTECTION IS NOT VERY GENEROUS SO FOR SOME PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THE OLDER PENSIONERS THEY WON'T SEE ANY INCREASE IN THEIR COMPENSATION WHATSOEVER HOWEVER LONG THEY LIVE I'VE JUST BEEN TALKING TO GEORGE MCDONALD AS WE WERE HEARING ABOUT WHAT ASSETS THERE ARE IN THE BUSINESS IF THERE ARE SOME LEFTOVER SURELY THEY CAN BE USED TO PLUG THEIR PENSION DEFICIT BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT PRIORITIES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO CREDITORS
THE THE PENSION SCHEMES BECOME ANNAN SICK OR BECOME UNSECURED CREDITORS SO O.K. EDITORS WOULD COMFORT THAT'S RIGHT AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THE C.V.A. DOCUMENTS THAT WERE PUBLISHED AS GEORGE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A MOMENT AGO WHICH WERE PUBLISHED VERY RECENTLY THAT WAS SECURED CREDITORS HAVE BEEN PAID THERE'S VERY VERY LITTLE LEFT FOR UNSECURED CREDITORS IN PARTICULAR THE PENSION SCHEME
GEORGE IF I CANNOT LET US COME BACK TO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THESE ASSETS AGAIN AND IF B.H.S. OWN STORES AND I KNOW THAT IT SOLD SOME BAD OF COURSE IS SOMETHING WHICH HAS VALUE BUT IT DOESN'T OWN ALL OF THE STORES BUT IT HAS SOME LEASES YES IT DOES YOU WONDER HOW MUCH VALUE THERE IS IN SOME OF THEM THOUGH BECAUSE IT WAS THROUGH THE LEAST SAILORS THAT THEY HOPE TO RAISE THE MONEY TO INVEST IN THE BUSINESS I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW IT PLAYS OUT
TO WHAT EXTENT LEASES MIGHT INSTANTLY REVERT TO LANDLORDS OR IT WHETHER IT IS REMAINS IN THE HANDS OF THE ADMINISTRATORS WHO JUST NOW WHAT ABOUT VALUE IN STOCK
WELL THERE ARE SPECIALIST COMPANIES ACTUALLY WHICH GET THE BEST VALUE THEY CAN OUT OF STOCK IN THESE SITUATIONS QUITE OFTEN THEY'LL PUT A BIT OF THEIR OWN STOCK INTO THE MIX TO DRAW SHOPPERS IN SO THEY MAY WELL BRING IN ONE OF THESE SPECIALIST LIQUIDATORS
CAN BE QUITE A LONG DRAWN OUT PROCESS IT CAN BE BUT YOU KNOW THEY TEND TO TRY AND MOVE AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN AND MAKE IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE IN FOOD BUSINESS CAN'T BE SAVED AND JUST TALKING ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE PROCESS JOHN SORTING OUT THE PENSION FUND IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY OR SWIFT IS IT THIS WHOLE PROCESS WILL TAKE YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS TO WORK ITS WAY THROUGH THE COURTS UNLESS SIR FILL IT COMES UP WITH AN AMOUNT OF MONEY
WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE TO THE PENSION REGULATOR AND WE'VE MENTIONED A FIGURE OF EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS AGAINST FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION TANYA THAT JUST SIMPLY DOESN'T TOUCH THE SIDES GEORGE MACDONALD AND JOHN ROLFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LET'S BRING IN TODAY'S MARKETS GUEST WHO IS NICK MEL HUA SHIT WHO IS HEAD OF GLOBAL EQUITIES ADAMANTLY GOOD MORNING TO YOU WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE B.H.S. STORY
I THINK IT'S QUITE CONCERNING I MEAN OBVIOUSLY B.H.S. HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO VERY DIFFICULT PLACES ON THE ONE HAND THE GROWTH ON LINE ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK ON THE HIGH STREET YOU'VE GOT TO DO THINGS REALLY DIFFERENTLY AND REALLY WELL YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF COMPETITORS THAT B.H.S. HAVE BEEN FACING PEOPLE LIKE PRIMARK AND ALSO ZARA WHO ARE FAST FASHION THEY'RE VERY GOOD VALUE
PRIMARK MY DAUGHTER'S CALLED PRIME ARNIE THEY LOVE GOING THERE IT'S A GREAT SHOPPING EXPERIENCE UNFORTUNATELY THEN WHAT AN INEXPERIENCED RETAILER WAS DOING BUYING IT THIS IS A VERY
FAST MOVING FAST CHANGING AREA WELL MAYBE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SOME KIND OF DEAL ON THE ASSETS AND AS WE SAID EARLIER ONE OF THE THINGS THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD DO WAS SELL SOME OF THESE LISA'S THEY HAD A BIG FLAGSHIP SHOP THEY SOLD LEASE ON THE HOUSE I THINK FOR THIRTY MILLION POUNDS WHICH WAS LESS THAN I EXPECTED
QUITE OFTEN YOU FIND THAT THESE RETAIL DEALS ARE OFTEN THE PEOPLE THAT COME INTO THEM ARE MOTIVATED BY PROPERTY RATHER THAN THE RETAIL BUSINESS AND AS YOU RIGHTLY SAID THIS IS VERY FAST MOVING IT'S A DIFFICULT BUSINESS TO BE IN AND IF YOU'RE NOT A REALLY GOOD RETAILER YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO SUCCEED AT THE MOMENT ON THE HIGH STREET OH CASE OF THE INVESTORS THEY DID NOT MAKE AGAIN NOR HAS LAKSHMI MITTAL ACCORDING TO THE SUNDAY TIMES RICH LIST HE'S LOST A LOT OF HIS WEALTH IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING TIME FOR INVESTORS ISN'T IT
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RICH LIST AS A PRETTY CLEAR MESSAGE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A COMMODITIES BUT YOU DO WANT TO BE IN PROPERTY SO MAYBE THIS WAS THE MOTIVATING FACTOR IN THAT B.H.S. DEAL BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE DONE WELL IN THE RICH LIST WHICH CAME OUT OVER THE WEEKEND IT'S VERY DOMINATED BY PROPERTY AND PARTICULARLY BY LONDON PROPERTY
WHICH HAS CONTINUED TO DEFY ALL THE DOOM SAYERS AND TO CONTINUE TO GO UP UNTIL AT LEAST VERY RECENTLY AS FAR AS PRIMUS CONSENT DOES THAT NOT TELL US MORE ABOUT THE EFFECTS AND ASSET BUBBLES CREATED BY QUANTITATIVE EASING AND IT DOES ANYTHING ELSE
YES IT PROBABLY DOES I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE QUITE SURPRISED BY HOW WELL PROPERTY HAS DONE OVER THE LAST DECADE BUT VERY LOW INTEREST RATES ARE LOTS OF LIQUID TO SEE IS A PRETTY POWERFUL DRIVING FORCED AND I MUST QUICKLY ASK YOU ALSO TALKING ABOUT QUANTITATIVE EASING ABOUT TO CENTRAL BANKS THIS WEEK ONE OF THEM IN THE U.S. AND ONE OF THEM IN JAPAN THEY HAVE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS TO MAKE WE'VE GOT A BIG WEEK AHEAD BECAUSE WE GOT BOTH FEDERAL RESERVE ON WEDNESDAY AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE BANK OF JAPAN
AS WELL MAKING ITS DECISIONS FEDERAL RESERVE I THINK NOBODY'S EXPECTING RATES TO GO UP IN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH MOST OF THE ECONOMIC DATA COMING OUT OF THE U.S. OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS HAS BEEN PRETTY POSITIVE IN CONTRAST WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING HERE IN THE U.K. AND ON THE STOCK MARKET AND THE STOCK MARKETS HAVE BEEN DOING WELL TOO AND I THINK THAT THE INTERESTING THING FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE IT IS GOING TO BE
HOW THEY GET BACK ONTO THIS PATH OF NORMALISATION FOR RATES THEIR POINTING TO A COUPLE OF RAZORS LATER ON IN THE YEAR WE'RE EXPECTING MAYBE JUNE JUNE CROSSES OVER WITH REFERENDUM HERE IN THE U.K. SO PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY MIGHT HAVE TO HOLD OFF AND JUNE AND JULY MAYBE AGAIN IN SEPTEMBER BUT THEN OF COURSE WE'VE GOT THE ELECTION COMING UP AND JUST BRIEFLY A WORD ON THE SURVEY FROM DELIGHT SAYING THAT CONSUMERS ARE NOT FEELING CONFIDENT AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR HEALTH
WELL IT MAY BE THAT WE'VE ALL GOT TOO MANY FIT BITS IN OUR POCKET SO WE'RE GETTING TOO OBSESSED WITH WE'VE DONE TEN THOUSAND STEPS A DAY OR NOT BUT I THINK PROBABLY IT'S NOT HEALTH THAT'S PROBABLY MORE LIKELY TO BE THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THESE RISKS ON THE HORIZON AND THE CONSUMER DOES FEEL THEM AND RESPONSE ACCORDINGLY AND NICK THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT NEITHER CAMPAIGN IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM EFFECTIVELY SAYS
WHAT THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS OR OTHER EYES TO HOUSEHOLDS MIGHT BE THIS ACCORDING TO A POLL BY COMPARE THE MARKET DOT COM THE PERSONAL FINANCE COMPARISON SITE ALSO SHOWED
PEOPLE'S VOTE INCISIONS COULD BE SWAYED BY EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION OF FINANCIAL BENEFITS SIMON MCCULLOCH IS WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO HE'S DIRECTOR COMPARE THE MARKET DOT COM GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS THAT THE FIGURES ON G.D.P. AT THE SIZE OF THE ECONOMY OF COURSE DON'T READY GIVE THEM AN IDEA AS TO WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THEM THAT'S RIGHT TANYA IT LOOKS LOOKS LIKE FROM THE RESULT WE HAVE AND IT'S RESEARCH CONSUMERS ARE CONCERNED THAT THE INFORMATION IS COMING OUT JUST ISN'T RELEVANT FOR THEM AND THEIR PERSONAL FINANCES
SO WHAT COULD MAKE THINGS RELEVANT TO THEM IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE I WAS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY TO SEMI FACTORS THAT COULD COME INTO PLAY WHAT CONSUMERS ARE SAYING IS THAT HER PERSONAL FINANCIAL IMPACT IS THEIR HIGHEST VOTING CONSIDERATION IT'S AHEAD OF JOBS IT'S HEAD OF IMMIGRATION SO REALLY THE CAMPAIGN THAT WANTS TO WIN REALLY NEEDS TO TURN THIS INTO MEANINGFUL NUMBERS FOR CONSUMERS SO THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEIR ELECTRICITY BILLS IS THAT INTEREST RATES WILL HAVE THE NUMBER ONE THING ACTUALLY CONSENT THAT'S GROCERIES FOLLOWED BY FUEL ALSO PETROL AND DIESEL AT THE PUMPS
AND IN THIRD WAS ACTUALLY ENERGY PRICES SO GAS ELECTRICITY AND ALL THOSE ANSWERS ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND THEM BUT SUMMER'S A SENSE THAT'S THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE UNLOCKED IT CAN BE A KEY BATTLEGROUND IN THE REFERENDUM AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT SIMON MCCULLOCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS IT A TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND THIS WEEK A SISTER STATION IT'S GOING TO BE PUTTING ON HIS WELLINGTON BOOTS AND HEADING FOR THE COUNTRY

USUALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YESTERDAY NO ANDREW MARR INTERVIEW
CONCEDING THAT IMMIGRATION WAS MUCH HARDER TO CONTROL INSIDE THE E.U. BUT SHE WILL ARGUE THAT ON BALANCE IN THE LONG TERM OVER THE NEXT TWENTY THIRTY YEARS
OUR ECONOMIC AND SECURITY NEEDS A BETTER SERVED BY REMAINING INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WE ARE BETTER PLACED TO TRY AND REFORM THE FAILINGS IN THE EUROPEAN FROM WITHIN AND SHE WILL CALL FOR QUOTES A MORE MATURE DEBATE HAVE TO SAY I THINK GIVEN THE BAR ROOM BRAWL GOING ON AROUND HER THAT'S UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN INDEED TODAY IT SEEMS TO GO UP ANOTHER LEVEL WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CONCERTED FIGHTS BACK BY THE BRECHT'S THE TEARS FOLLOWING THEIR WEEK FROM HELL
AFTER OF COURSE TO GO BATTERING ON THE ECONOMY TODAY WE SEE A TRIO OF INTERVENTIONS FROM THEIR BIG BEASTS BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO OWEN PATERSON TRYING TO SHIFT IT SEEMS TO ME THE FOCUS BACK ON TO THEIR MORE FAVOURED TERRAIN AROUND IMMIGRATION THAT LONG FORGOTTEN DEAL STRUCK BY MY CAMERA SO YOU DON'T GET THE SAYS THEY'RE ON THE BACK FOOT AT THE MOMENT I THINK I HAD AN EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT WE CAN DE NIGEL FARAGE HIMSELF CONCEDED YESTERDAY IT WAS THEIR WORST WEEK SO FAR BECAUSE ON THE ECONOMY

TRYING TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THIS IS MEANT TO BE A REFERENDUM ON THE DEAL NEGOTIATED BY MY CAMERON WHICH SENSEI
MANAGED TO REACH HER BACK IN THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY BASICALLY WE'VE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT SINCE THAT'S JUST BEEN PUSHED TO THE SIDE BUT MORE THAN THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET BACK ON TO THIS CRITICAL ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION WITH MICHAEL GOES TODAY IT'S RING A VERY STARK WARNING THAT IN HIS VIEW IF WE REMAIN IN THE E.U. WE WILL BE TAKING MIGRANTS NOT JUST FROM THE EXISTING E.U. COUNTRIES BUT FROM ALBANIA MACEDONIA TURKEY THE APPLICANT PUNTERS AND THAT WILL IN HIS WORDS LEADS TO QUOTE A DIRECT AND SERIOUS THREAT TO OUR PUBLIC SERVICES MORE THAN THAT
IT WILL JEOPARDISE OUR LIVING STANDARDS IT WILL THREATEN A SOCIAL SOLIDARITY AND FOCUSES IN PARTICULAR ON WHAT HE CALLS THE UNQUANTIFIABLE STRAIN ON THE N.H.S. AND HE SUGGESTED IF WE ARE OUT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WILL HAVE THIS CONTENTIOUS FIGURE OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION MORE TO SPEND ON THE N.H.S. AND I THINK HE EVEN ALLUDES THAT MAYBE WE COULD AVOID THINGS LIKE THE JUNIOR DOCTOR STRIKE IF WE HAD THAT EXTRA CASH TO PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES FOR THE N.H.S. DUNCAN SMITH AT TEN PAST THANK YOU
TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN A LITTLE OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS' TIME THE LATEST JUNIOR DOCTORS STRIKE WILL BEGIN IN THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND THIS STRIKE WILL BE DIFFERENT NO THAT'S FOR THE FIRST TIME EMERGENCY COVER WILL BE WITHDRAWN HUGH PYM IS A HEALTH EDITOR MORNING TO YOU HERE WE HAVE THAT CROSS PARTY CALL FOR THESE CONTRACTS TO BE PILOTED BUT ALMOST AS SOON AS IT HAD COME OUT THEY'LL SECRETARY SAID NO WE WON'T BE DOING THAT
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT NICK WE HAD A FLURRY OF LETTERS OVER THE WEEKEND I THINK REFLECTING ATTEMPTS BY BOTH SIDES TO TRY TO FIND ONE LAST ATTEMPT TO BE LIKE TO STAVE OFF THE STRIKES THEY ARE UNPRECEDENTED IT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT MOMENT THAT TOMORROW AND WEDNESDAY DOCTORS IN ENGLAND WILL WALK OUT
OF ALL FORMS OF CARE INCLUDING A MATERNITY SERVICES INTENSIVE CARE THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE N.H.S. SO EVERY ATTEMPT IS BEING MADE JEREMY HUNT'S LINE WAS I'M PRESSING ON WITH HIS CONTRACT
I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE IT NATIONALLY I'M GOING TO ROLL IT OUT FROM AUGUST IT DOES NEED TO BE DONE NATIONALLY RATHER THAN PILOTED AS WERE SUGGESTED BY LABOUR AND OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES HE IN TURNER'S ASKED MARK PORTER OF THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION TO COME THE TALK TODAY TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE ALL OTHER DOCTORS CONCERNS
ABOUT THE MAXIMUM WORKING HOURS AND TRAINING AND SO ON YOU TO LOOK LOVE YOU MAKE WHO LOST NIGHT YOU WOULD NOT FAIL MY BLINKIN A DISPUTE LIKE THIS YOU AN UPSIDE FROM THEIR PUBLIC POSITIONS BEHIND THE SCENES WHO LOOKS TO YOU WHICH SIDE LOOKS DO YOU LIKE THEY'RE GETTING MOST EDGY MOTION NERVY THAT THEY MAY BE LOSING PUBLIC SUPPORT HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR POSITION
I THINK TO BE HONEST NICK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT JUDGEMENT I THINK TOMORROW'S GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING I THINK ONE OR TWO PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHETHER SOME JUNIOR DOCTORS WILL FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THIS FULL WALK OUT THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING VERY HARD ABOUT
WHETHER IN ALL CONSCIENCE THEY CAN DO IT AT THE SAME TIME BOTH SIDES WE'RE LOOKING AT PUBLIC SUPPORT BUT THERE'S REALLY NO SIGN OF ANY TALKS TAKING PLACE TODAY AT THE MOMENT AS SPITE WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND BOTH SIDES SEEM DETERMINED TO PRESS ON JUNIOR DOCTORS
ADAMANT THAT THEY HAVE A CAMPAIGN THEY'RE GOING TO CARRY ON WITH THEY FEEL VERY ANGRY THAT THE CONTRACT WAS IMPOSED ON THEM AND THE TALKS DIDN'T CONTINUE MARK PORTER THE B.M.A. WROTE BACK LAST NIGHT SO IF YOU DROPPED IN POSITION WE DROP THE STRIKES STRAIGHT AWAY AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP VERY EASILY
THIS IS GOING TO CARRY ON A FEMALE ENTRANT WILL BE TALKING HIM UP OR TO THE B.M.A. LATER AS WELL AS THE PRESENT AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS THANK YOU TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THINGS LOOK BLEAK FOR B.H.S. THAT'S WHAT THE B. B. C. HAS BEEN TOLD THE FIRM THAT OWNS THE SHOPS HAVE BEEN SAYING NOTHING PUBLICLY A REPORTER CATRIONA RENTON IS OUTSIDE THE BIG B.H.S. STORE AND OXFORD STREET WHAT ARE THEY SAYING THEY'RE ONE OF THEM STARTED ARRIVING FOR WORK BUT WHAT'S THE SENSE CATRIONA

POINTER TO WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE'S BEEN SPECULATION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY GROWING OVER THE WEEKEND SOURCES CLOSE TO THE NURSE TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THINGS DON'T LOOK GOOD AND JUDGING FROM NEWSPAPER REPORTS THIS MORNING IT SEEMS THAT'S THE CASE THERE'S AN EXCLUSIVE IN THIS MORNING'S MIRROR NEWSPAPER CLAIMING TO HAVE SEEN A LETTER THAT'S BEING SENT TO STAFF FROM THE LEADER OF THE CONSORTIUM
RETAIL ACQUISITIONS HE'S CALLED DOMINIC CHAPEL HE HE BOUGHT THE BUSINESS FOR A POUND FROM THE BILLIONAIRE TOPSHOP OWNER SIR PHILIP GREEN LAST YEAR IN THE MINUTE QUARTZ THE LETTERS SEEING THE CONSORTIUM HAS BEEN UNABLE TO SECURE A THUNDER OR A TRADE SALE
AND HAS CALLED FOR THE BUSINESS TO GO INTO ADMINISTRATION AND THE STEAM AND GOES ON TO SAY THAT WAGES WOULD BE PAID FOR THIS MONTH THERE WE KNOW THE CONSORTIUM WAS IN TALKS ALL WEEKEND TRYING TO SECURE A SIXTY MILLION POUND FINANCING DEAL FROM PRIVATE INVESTORS GORDON BROTHERS IT'S ALSO BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH THE COMPANY'S SPORTS DIRECT THAT'S OWNED BY THE NEWCASTLE UNITED BILLIONAIRE MAKE ASHLEY ABOUT THE POSSIBLE SALE
OF PART OR ALL OF THEIR BUSINESS BUT IT APPEARS THAT THESE TALKS HAVE BEEN FRUITLESS AND A SPOKESPERSON THE COMPANY HAS SENT A STATEMENT IS EXPECTED ABOUT B.H.S. HIS FUTURE ACCORDING TO REPORTS IN THE PAPER WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT TO BE A VET AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING AND THE THING IS IT PEOPLE LIKE SPORES DIRECT ALL SERIOUSLY WHAT THEY WON'T DO IS TAKE ON THE PENSION THUNDERED PENSION DEFICIT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS
THAT'S RIGHT THE DEBTS THAT B.H.S. HAS A ONE POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS IN THE PENSION DEFICIT IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN HALF A BILLION POUNDS OF COURSE AN UNATTRACTIVE PROSPECT FOR ANY NEW ORDER AND IT'S THOUGHT THOUGH THAT THE PENSION GAP COULD BE PLUGGED BY THE GOVERNMENT'S PENSION PROTECTION FUND BUT IT DOES LEAD OF COURSE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOME B.H.S. HAS BEEN RUN
OVER THE YEARS IT'S LOST PASTE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER HIGH STREET NAMES LIKE ZARA AND PRIMARK AS WELL AS SOME OF THE SUPERMARKETS AND IT'S ALSO STRUGGLED TO KEEP UP WITH ITS ONLINE OFFERING NO IT SEEMS THAT SAVE A MEDICAL B.H.S. IS LIKELY TO GO INTO ADMINISTRATION OF COURSE THAT THESE QUESTION MARKS FOR THOSE ELEVEN THOUSAND WHO WORK AND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR STORES THANKS KATRINA
NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE JUNIOR DOCTORS' STRIKE IN ENGLAND IS THE MAIN STORY FOR THE TELEGRAPH AND FOR THE MALE WHICH WARNS READERS DON'T GET SICK TOMORROW THE TELEGRAPH HIGHLIGHTS THE WARNING FROM THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT THAT LIVES COULD BE PUT AT RISK AND MAIL SAYS MY HUNT IN THE DOCTORS' UNION THE B.M.A. REFUSED TO BUDGE FROM THEIR POSITIONS OVER THE WEEKEND DESPITE A FLURRY OF LETTERS BETWEEN THEM SOME WOMEN DUE TO GIVE BIRTH THIS WEEK HAVE BEEN TOLD THEIR PROCEDURES TO INDUCE LABOUR WILL BE POSTPONED FOR SEVERAL DAYS REPORT
THE MIRROR'S MADE HEADLINE KATRINA WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT IT JESS S.O.S. REPORTS THAT HE DEPARTMENT STORE CHAINS OWNER HAS WRITTEN TO START TELLING THEM THAT IT IS GOING INTO ADMINISTRATION SO SAYS DOMINIC CHAPELS LETTER EXPRESSES REGRET THAT IN SPITE OF A MASSIVE EFFORT FROM HIS TEAM THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SECURE EXTRA FUNDING OR A BUYER FOR THE BUSINESS THE GUARDIAN REPORTS AT THE ADMINISTRATORS WILL TRY TO SELL B.H.S. AS A GOING CONCERN UNLESS A LAST MINUTE RESCUE DEAL IS AGREED WITH SPORTS DIRECT
THE TIME SAYS THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GAVE HIS LAUNCHING WHAT IT CALLS A BRICKS IT FIGHT BACK AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S INTERVENTION BUT THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN ON THE DEFENSIVE WRITING IN THE PAPER MY GAVE WARNS THAT BRITAIN WILL BE SUBJECT TO A MIGRATION FREE FOR ALL AS THE E.U. EXPANDS TO TAKE IN FIVE NEW APPLICANT COUNTRIES INCLUDING ALBANIA AND TURKEY
IN HIS DAILY TELEGRAPH COLIN THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON ONCE THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN THERE CROWING TOO SOON IF THEY THINK IT'S GAME OVER HE SAYS THEY'RE WRONG IF THEY THINK THEY'VE BOMBED BELIEVE SIDE INTO SUBMISSION WITH TESTIMONIALS FROM AMERICAN PRESIDENT'S BUSINESS LEADERS AND FAT CATS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION ACCORDING TO THE SUN A MAN WHO INDECENTLY ASSAULTED A YOUNG BARMAID HAS HAD HIS CURFEW LIFTED FOR A WEEK SO THAT HE CAN GO TO THE GLASTONBURY FESTIVAL
THE NIGHT TIME CURFEW WAS IMPOSED ON TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD HARRY WEBB AS PART OF A SUSPENDED PRISON SENTENCE BUT THE JUDGE AT SWINDON CROWN COURT VARIED IT WHEN HE WAS TOLD THAT A FAMILY OUTING TO GLASTONBURY HAD BEEN BOOKED AND PAID FOR
GREENBELT UNDER SIEGE IS THE MAIN HEADLINE IN THE ART NEWSPAPER WHICH REPORTS ARE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW HOMES ARE PLANNED IN THE COUNTRYSIDE WITH LONDON YORKSHIRE IN THE WEST MIDLANDS EARMARKED FOR LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENT THE FIGURE COMES FROM THE C.P.R. THE CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT RURAL ENGLAND WHICH SAYS THE NUMBER OF HOUSES PLANNED IN THE GREEN BELT HAS INCREASED BY FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND IN A YEAR THE STORY ALSO FEATURED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE GUARDIAN WHICH IS THE RISE MAKES A MOCKERY OF GOVERNMENT PLEDGES TO PROTECT THE COUNTRYSIDE
AND THE TIMES TURNS TO HER STORY REPORTED OVER THE WEEKEND THAT ART LOVERS HAVE CRITICISED THE V.&A. MUSEUM IN LONDON FOR BANNING PEOPLE FROM SKETCHING ITEMS ON SHOW AT TWO OF ITS EXHIBITIONS BOTTICELLI OF RE IMAGINED AND THE BRIEF HISTORY OF UNDERWEAR THE MUSEUM SAYS THE BAND WILL EASE CONGESTION FOR VISITORS BUT IT HAS FAILED TO APPEASE CRITICS WHO SAY SKETCHING IN A GALLERY IS CRUCIAL FOR ASPIRING ARTISTS THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE V. AND A. SIR ROY STRONG AND STILL THE TIMES HE'S NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUS
IT'S SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING ADMINISTRATORS ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPOINTED TODAY FOR THE STRUGGLING RETAILER B.H.S. BUT THE JOBS OF ELEVEN THOUSAND STAFF AT RISK
NEXT WEEK VOTERS IN NORTHERN IRELAND WILL ELECT A NEW DEVOLVED ASSEMBLY AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF NEW FACES NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE PRESENT MEMBERS WILL NOT BE STANDING AGAIN POLITICIANS WHOSE CAREERS WERE SHAPED BY THE TROUBLES A RETIRING AND NEW VOICES ARE GAINING PROMINENCE OUR IRELAND CORRESPONDENT CHRIS PAGE HAS BEEN MEETING SOME OF THE CANDIDATES WHO HAVEN'T RUN FOR ELECTION BEFORE AND ASK THEM IF A GENERATIONAL SHIFT WILL CHANGE POLITICS
IN SOUTH BELFAST YOU'RE NEVER FAR FROM THE RIVER LAGGAN AND IN THIS CONSTITUENCY IN PARTICULAR THERE'S PLENTY OF POLITICAL WATER ARE MOVING ONTO THE BRIDGE NONE OF THE POLITICIANS ELECTED THE STORM AT LAST TIME WE'RE STARTING AGAIN
IN AN AREA WHERE THE WORST RUNNERS AND CYCLISTS ARE EVERYWHERE IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE CANDIDATES NAE OR AN ENERGETIC
GOOD MORNING ALL THEIR SHOES ON LET'S GO LET'S WHAT WAS IT LIKE A BIT OF LUCK I COULD NEVER KEEP UP WITH YOU AND TELLING YOU
WHAT WILL HEAR HE'S ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT EXERCISE AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP HE'S A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN WITH INTERESTS OF BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC HIS PARTY IS SINN FEIN
PEOPLE FROM TO BELFAST WILL FAULT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SEE RADICAL CHANGE IN PARTICULAR IN JOB CREATION
I THINK THAT'S THAT THE MOST PORTANT REASON WAS COMPELLING REASON TO VOTE FOR SINN FEIN AND ISATION IS MY RAG AND SO PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW DOWN OR ELECTIONS HERE STILL MAINLY ABOUT UNIONISM NATIONALISM THE MERITS OF THE UNION
OR IS THAT CHANGING THE MERITS OF SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES HAD AN OUNCE OF THE STARS AND THE BASES OF JOB CREATION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PART OF THAT AS LINK THEN TEA IN THE ISLAND BUT OUR POLITICS CHANGE HER NAME
DEFINITELY A CHANGE IN THE POLITICIAN HE GOES TO ANNIE DOOR WITH AN ORANGE IN GREEN STANDARD ALONE WILL BE CRUCIFIED
FOR ME YOU NEED TO GO TO THE TO THE DOOR WITH THAT RIUM BALL FLAG YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACT AT ALL THE PEOPLE I NEED A FORMER SO MUCH WITH THE APPOINTMENT TODAY
FLAGS AREN'T IMPORTANT WHAT'S IMPORTANT JOBS EDUCATION OR HEALTH
IT SOUNDS VERY DIFFERENT TO THE REPUBLICAN RHETORIC OF THE PAST BUT SINN FEIN HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY BROADEN THEIR APPEAL DURING THE PEACE PROCESS FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS THEIR MAIN PARTNERS IN THE POWER SHARING GOVERNMENT HERE HAVE BEEN THE DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTY BUT OTHER PARTY SAY THE WINDS OF CHANGE HAVEN'T TURNED QUICKLY ENOUGH
CYCLE RACE
DUNCAN MORROW WAS FROM THE ALLIANCE PARTY WHICH IS NEITHER A UNIONIST NOR NATIONALIST HE'S AN ACADEMIC BUT USED TO RUN AN ORGANISATION WHICH PROMOTED GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN COMMUNITIES
THERE IS A DEGRADED WHICH ATTITUDES TOWARDS COMMUNITY RELATIONS FOLLOW POLITICS RATHER THAN LEAD
AND IN SOME WAYS THEY'RE HIGH POINTS OF OPTIMISM CAME WITH THE GREAT POLITICAL BREAKTHROUGHS WITH THE CEASEFIRES WITH THE AGREEMENT AND THEN WITH DEVOLUTION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN
HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING HAS BEEN THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF STREET PARTIES COME BACK WE'VE SEEN STOP START GOVERNMENT DISPUTES ABOUT FLAGS WHICH BASICALLY BROUGHT THE ECONOMY IN THE COUNTRY
POLITICIANS NEED TO TAKE THESE DISHES NEED TO FIND PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THE KEY IF HE'S A FUTURE ORIENTATED NOT JUST
WOULD BE PART OF A NORMAL SOCIETY AND I THINK WE NEED TO WORK THE COMMON THAT PEOPLE THEY HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IDENTITIES AND CONSTITUTIONAL ASPIRATIONS BUT THEY'RE NOT BINARY THEY DON'T DEFINE WHO PEOPLE ARE
AS ONE OF A NUMBER OF YOUNG POLITICIANS IN THE SENIOR RANKS OF THE S.D.L.P. THE SECOND NATIONALIST PARTY
SHE SENSES A GENERATIONAL SHIFT AT THE HOPING FOR A GRADUAL RENAISSANCE B.S.T. L.P.S DECLINE OCCURRED OVER A FEW YEARS AND A FEW ELECTIONS AND I THINK A RESURGENCE WILL OCCUR OVER A FEW YEARS AND A FEW LETTERS THAT WE DO HAVE A NEW VIBRANT YOUNG LEADERSHIP TEAM AND WE ARE
TRYING TO REFLECT BACK THE THINGS THE PEOPLE ARE RAISING WITH US THERE IS A DEEP FRUSTRATION
NO PIERCE OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS AND STOREMAN BUT SOME OF IT IS JUST ABOUT BUMS ON SEATS YOU JUST NEED A DIFFERENT SET OF PERSONNEL THERE MAYBE THE C.M. TWO AULD MAN HERE AND TO BE AT THEY'VE BEEN HAVING FOR DECKING
HI THERE SORRY ANOTHER CYCLIST AND ANOTHER WOULD BE ASSEMBLY MEMBER UNDER FORTY ROTTEN MCKEOWN IS A CANDIDATE FOR THE ULSTER UNIONIST PARTY IN NORTHERN IRELAND BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD DEVOLUTION OF THE SUDAN
PUBLIC WEREN'T THIS TUNED INTO THE FACT THAT IF PEOPLE WEREN'T DELIVERING THEY COULD BE REPLACED
AND I THINK THIS ELECTION IS ONE WHERE THAT CONCEPTS REALLY CRYSTALLISED
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE D.U.P. AND SINN THREE AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE NINE YEARS THAT THEY'VE HAVEN'T GOVERNMENT ON THIS THINKING ACTUALLY FOR SOMETHING BRILLIANT AND MY HAPPY WITH THAT
BROADLY PEOPLE ARE SAY NO THEY SEE US AND THE S.D.L.P. AS POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE
HE HAS WORKED AS AN ADVISER AT STORMONT LIKE ONE OF HIS UNIONIST RIVALS IN SOUTH BELFAST
THE OTHER THING I'M A LITTLE PEN DELIS TEAM IS PUTTING UP POSTERS SHE'S CLIMBING THE POLITICAL LADDER IN THE D. U. P.
HE DOESN'T RECOGNISE THE PICTURE SOME OTHER PARTIES A PAINTING OF THE LAST ADMINISTRATION I WORKED IN IN POLITICS IN NORTHERN IRELAND FOR ALMOST A DECADE I SPEND THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF MY TIME NINETY PERCENT PLUS
NOT DEALING WITH WHAT COULD BE PERCEIVED AS ORANGE AND GREEN
IF SHE'S THAT IDEAL WAS FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE DELIVERING SO CHANGE LOOKING AT EDUCATION UNDERACHIEVEMENT LOOKING AT
A PUB REALLY LOOKING AT SUPPORTING FAMILIES NORTHERN IRELAND HAS BEEN
VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL OF ATTRACTING NEW JOBS BUT THEY'RE A GOOD NEWS STORY ISN'T GETTING OUT THERE AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN PEOPLE IN A PISTE
JUST TALKING ABOUT THE OLD ISSUES YOU SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS OF THE PAST ARE GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE
BUT WE ARE DETERMINED TO TRY TO DO THAT BUT TO DO SO IN A WAY WHICH ACTUALLY DOES MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A WAY OF MOVING FORWARD AS WELL AND THEN WE CAN BUILD ON THAT AND TERMS OF RECKONS
IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE PAST STILL HAUNTS THE POLITICS OF THE PRESENT
BUT WAS DEFINITELY MORE TALK NOI ABOUT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION IS BECOMING LESS PROMINENT A NEW GENERATION OF POLITICIANS SEEM SET TO MAKE AN IMPACT
AS THE CONFLICT FADES INTO HISTORY VOTERS YOU DEMANDING PROSPERITY AS WELL AS
IT'S NOW TEN TO SEVEN A YEAR AGO TODAY NEPAL WAS HIT BY A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE WHICH LEFT ALMOST NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE DEAD TWENTY TWO THOUSAND INJURED AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMELESS THEN FAT AND WAS THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED AND IS A REGULAR VISITOR TO THE COUNTRIES THE NEPAL COUNTRY DIRECTOR OF ADAM SMITH INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SERVICES BUSINESS HE JOINS US IN THE MORNING TO YOU MORNING
LET'S BEGIN WITH YOUR MEMORIES HOW VIVID ALL THOSE MEMORIES OF THE EARTHQUAKE WHEN YOU WERE IN KATHMANDU IT'S EXTREMELY FIT I WAS I WAS IN MY OFFICE IT WAS JUST BEFORE LUNCH ON A SATURDAY MORNING AND SUDDENLY THE THE BUILDING STARTED SHAKING VERY VIOLENTLY AND MY COLLEAGUES AND I JUMPED UP DROPPED EVERYTHING WE WERE DOING AND RAN OUTSIDE AND THEN OVER THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS OR SO WE WE BASICALLY WITNESSED A SERIES OF VERY POWERFUL AFTERSHOCKS
AND THAT IS THE KEY TO THIS STORY IN THE WAY ISN'T IT WE TEND TO AS THE NEWS MADE HER BEWARE THERE FOR THE BEGINNING MAYBE THE FIRST AFTER AFTERSHOCK BUT THEY GO ON AND ON AND ON WITH DEVASTATING EFFECT THEY DO THEY'RE THERE OF BEING SOMETHING LIKE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY AFTER SHOCKS IN THE LAST YEAR THE MOST RECENT ONE WAS JUST OVER A WEEK AGO AND IT'S GOING FOR THAT THE KEEPS GOING AND THE THE REAL IMPACT OF THIS IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL ONE I MEAN THE THE EIGHT THE EARTHQUAKE WAS IN APRIL LAST YEAR A LOT AND A PAULIE'S WEREN'T
WEREN'T WILLING TO SLEEP INDOORS UNTIL ABOUT AUGUST BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SCARED WITH THESE AFTERSHOCKS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE A NIGHT TAKING PLACE AND PEOPLE PEOPLE WHOSE HOUSES WERE DAMAGED CRACKS IN THE WALLS WERE JUST TERRIFIED THAT A PICK OFF CHOP WOULD COME IN THE ROOF WOULD COME IN SO IT MEANS WHEN YOU'RE VISITING THE COUNTRY NOW YOU'RE STILL VISIT A COUNTRY THAT IS BY NO MEANS BACK TO NORMAL
I MEAN IT'S SLOWLY GETTING BACK TO NORMAL BUT IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN A VERY TOUGH YEAR FOR NEPAL YEAH AND PEOPLE THEREFORE IF THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO LIVE IN THEIR HOUSES OR CALMED LIVING IN SHELTERS OR TENTS AND SO ON EXACTLY I MEAN THE THE HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE WAS QUITE QUICK AND TEMPORARY SHELTER WAS PROVIDED TO MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE MADE HOMELESS PRETTY QUICKLY THE ISSUE IS WHERE A YEAR ON NOW AND MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE STILL LIVING IN TEMPORARY SHELTERS AND ECONOMICALLY HOW SUCCESSFUL IS THE COUNTRY BEING AT GETTING BACK ON ITS FEET
I MEAN THE EARTHQUAKE OBVIOUSLY HAD QUITE A BIG IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY BUT MUCH WORSE WAS THE ECONOMIC BLOCKADE WHICH AFFECTED NEPAL FROM SEPTEMBER TO JANUARY OR FEBRUARY WHICH WAS A RESULT OVER A BORDER DISPUTE BETWEEN NEPAL AND INDIA AND THAT
THAT'S BASICALLY DECIMATED NIPPLES ECONOMY THIS YEAR SO ON THE ONE HAND THERE'S THIS CONTINUING CALL FOR AID AND RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT AND YET ON THE OTHER HAS A BLOCKADE THAT'S CAUSED HUGE ECONOMIC AREN'T EXACTLY NOTHING
THAT ENDED IN FEBRUARY THINGS ARE JUST STARTING TO GET NORMAL AGAIN NOW BUT YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW IT'S A YEAR SINCE THE EARTHQUAKE AND IT FEELS LIKE IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG YEAR I THINK FOR ASSUMING YOU WORK FOR THE ADAM SMITH INSTITUTE OFFSHOOT OF IT THE ADAMS WITH INTERNATIONAL ADAM SMITH INTERNATIONALIST SEPARATE FROM THE INSTITUTE BUT DO YOU KNOW I WOULD'VE THOUGHT IDEOLOGICALLY COMMITTED TO HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEVELOPMENT SO IF YOU'RE NOT WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO THEM BALLS PROBLEMS
WELL THE ANSWER TO NIPPLES PROBLEMS ARE I MEAN ADAM SMITH INTERNATIONAL IMPLEMENTS PROJECTS FOR FOOT DONORS THEY SET THEIR POLICIES WE'RE NOT WE DON'T HAVE A AN ORGANISATIONAL IDEOLOGY WE DO A LOT OF WORK FOR THE U.K. DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EXAMPLE IN THERE PAUL
I'VE BEEN WORKING IN A POLL FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE THE BIGGEST SOLUTION TO NEPAL'S PROBLEMS IS TO UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL OF ITS HYDROPOWER RESOURCES WHICH WILL REALLY TRANSFORM A PULSE ECONOMY
IN FACT OF ATOMS WITH INTERNATIONAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN FIVE BILLION COLD CALLS WERE MADE IN THIS COUNTRY LAST YEAR THAT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FOR EVERY ADULT WILL NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT BACK BECAUSE THE CALLERS ARE BEING FORCED TO REVEAL THEIR NUMBERS CHRISTOPHER GRAHAM AS THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER OR STEP FORWARD BECAUSE WE CAN PRESUMABLY THEN REPORT THEM TO YOU LOT AND YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
WELL IT IS A SMALL STEP FORWARD BUT I THINK IT'S QUITE A SIGNIFICANT ONE BECAUSE FOR A START CALLERS GET THE CHOICE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO PICK UP THE PHONE BUT THEN THEY'VE GOT THE INFORMATION TO REPORT UNWELCOME CALLS CAUSE THAT HAVE COME THROUGH IN DEFIANCE OF THE REGULATION WHEN YOU'RE REGISTERED WITH THE TELEPHONE PREFERENCE SERVICE AND YOU CAN GO TO THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WITH WITH MORE INFORMATION AND WERE ABLE TO TRACK THESE PEOPLE DOWN AND DO WHAT TO THEM
WELL FIND THEM AND THE CHANGES MADE JUST A YEAR AGO WHICH MADE IT EASIER TO IMPOSE THESE FINDS MEAN THIS WEEK WE'LL BE ANNOUNCING OUR NINETEENTH FINE SINCE THAT RULE CHANGE OVER TWO MILLION POUNDS IN TOTAL AND IT'S REALLY BEGINNING TO TO HAVE AN IMPACT
TAKING A LONG TIME TO GET HERE WITH ALL THESE SINGLE STEPS ISN'T IT WELL WE'VE BEEN PUSHING THE GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET RID OF THE OBLIGATION TO PROVE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE OR SUBSTANTIAL SIR ALSO SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE OR SUBSTANTIAL A FENCE
NOW WE SIMPLY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THERE'S BEEN A CALL HIM IN DEFIANCE OF THE RULES AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S MADE A BIG CHANGE I THINK WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO DO MORE AND I THINK DIRECTORS SHOULD BE MADE LIABLE PERSONALLY SO THEY CAN'T CLOSE DOWN A COMPANY AND START AGAIN AND PERHAPS THE TELL COZ COULD DO MORE TO TO TO ALERT THE AT THE REGULATOR WHEN THEY SEE PEOPLE BREACHING THESE NEW RULES AND AND STILL WITHHOLDING NUMBERS WE JUST BURN IT ALL TOGETHER
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU DO BAN IT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE PEOPLE CAN CAN RING YOU UP IT'S ONLY IF THEY RING YOU UP AND YOU FIND THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL YOU SOMETHING THAT'S IN BREACH OF THE RULES THEY RANG UP TO SAY HELLO ARE YOU DOING YES QUITE WHAT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CALLS WE GET I'M INTRIGUED BY THIS FIGURE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO GET HUGE NUMBERS AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T SOMETHING BUT NEVER GET THEM
WELL I THINK THIS IS THIS IS THE WORRYING THING AND THIS IS WHERE THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER COMES IN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BEING TARGETED AND IDENTIFY DEPENDING ON WHAT STAGE OF LIFE THEY'VE GOT TO WHETHER THEY'RE WHERE THEY'RE THEIR HOME WHERE THEY'RE ELDERLY AND SO ON AND IN DEFENCE OF PEOPLE'S PRIVACY AT THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER IS HERE TO UPHOLD THE RULES IT'S THE DATA PROTECTION AS WELL AS THEIR PRIVACY AND COMMUNICATIONS REGULATION ALL RIGHT SO IT'S A BIT SCARY BECAUSE THEY KNOW STUFF ABOUT US THEY SHOULDN'T KNOW
WHEREVER WE WERE AT WHATEVER WE DO ONLINE WE'RE LEAVING A TRAIL OF INFORMATION WHICH WHICH THE MARKERS WILL USE BUT BUT THESE RULES ARE BEING TOUGHENED UP AND THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE IS THERE TO TAKE ACTION WE WANT PEOPLE TO REPORT THEIR EXPERIENCES
SO THAT WE CAN INVESTIGATE AND WE CAN THEN FINE AND NOT WITHHOLDING YOUR NUMBER IS IS ANOTHER RULE WHICH PEOPLE COULD COULD BREACH AND WOULD GET THEM INTO TROUBLE EVEN WHEN EVEN WHEN THE NUMBER ISN'T CLEAR THE INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE GIVE US GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY OF PIECING TOGETHER A STORY AND WE CAN IDENTIFY COMPANIES AND GO AFTER THEM AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING CHRIS GRAHAM THANKS VERY MUCH

NURSERY SCHOOL SAY THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUIREMENT FOR ELLIE YEARS TEACHERS IN ENGLAND TO HOLD GHQ SEES IN ENGLISH AND MATHS IS HAVING A CATASTROPHIC EFFECT ON RECRUITMENT THEIR CAMPAIGN GROUP SAVE OUR EARLY YEARS CLAIMED FOOLED GHQ SEAS WERE UNNECESSARY BUT THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION SAID STRONG NUMERACY AND LITERACY SKILLS WERE ESSENTIAL FOR A STAFF WORKING WITH YOUNG CHILDREN HERE'S OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
FROM SEPTEMBER NEW RECRUITS TO NURSERY SCHOOLS MUST HAVE GOOD GCS IN ENGLISH AND MATHS IF THEY'RE TO COUNT TOWARDS THE SCHOOL'S COMPLEMENT OF STAFF SCHOOLS HAVE TO ABIDE BY STRICT STAFFING RATIOS PROVIDING FOR EXAMPLE AT LEAST ONE MEMBER OF STAFF TO EVERY EIGHT THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN
NURSERIES SAID THEY WERE ALREADY FINDING IT HARD TO RECRUIT STAFF AND CALLED FOR QUALIFICATIONS CALLED FUNCTIONAL SKILLS WHERE THE TOP MARK IS REGARDED AS EQUIVALENT TO A GOOD GHQ TO BE ACCEPTED FOR THE JOB OF EARLY YEARS EDUCATOR BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE SKILLS IN CARING AND COMMUNICATION AS WELL AS MATHS AND ENGLISH
THE AMERICAN SOUL SINGER BILLY PAUL HAS DIED FROM CANCER AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY HE WAS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO HIT ME AND MISSUS JONES WHICH WON A GRAMMY AWARD AND REACH NUMBER ONE IN THE U.S. CHART
FIFTH LISTER'S LETTERS THIS IS JOE
THE MUSIC OF BILLY PAUL WHO HAS DIED SUSAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE WHICH OF COURSE YOU DON'T YOU'D BE BEST TO AVOID BEING SERIOUSLY ILL OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS IN JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS' TIME THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND FACES ANOTHER TWO DAY JUNIOR DOCTORS STRIKE
THIS TIME THOUGH IT'S A STRIKE UNLIKE ANY THAT HAS GONE BEFORE JUNIOR DOCTORS WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME REFUSED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY COVER MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED OPERATIONS FOUR THOUSAND IMPATIENT TREATMENTS AND EIGHT AND A HALF THOUSAND DAY CASE PROCEDURES HAVE ALREADY HAD TO BE CANCELLED AMONGST THEM
KAREN SMITH WHO JOINS ON THE LINE FROM BATH WHO'S DUE TO UNDERGO A SPINAL PROCEDURE ON THURSDAY MORNING TO YOU KAREN HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS PROCEDURE TO YOU THINK YOU'VE HAD CANCELLED
IT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME IT MEANS THAT I'LL BE PAIN FREE FOR THREE TO FOUR MONTHS AFTER I HAVE IT DONE
I AM DESPERATELY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT HASN'T GONE AHEAD THAT'S I DO SUPPORT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN THEIR ACTION THAT'S INTERESTING DESPERATELY DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU'VE GOT THAT LETTER TELLING YOU YOU WERE CANCELLED WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION INITIALLY I WAS DEVASTATED THAT I I WON'T DENY IT
IT WAS SO DISAPPOINTING AND FRUSTRATING AND I'VE BEEN WAITING SINCE FEBRUARY TO HAVE THIS DONE SO I'VE ALREADY WAITED
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND IF YOU HAD NO IDEA WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN NO THE LETTER JUST SAID THAT MY APPOINTMENT WILL BE
REALLOCATE IT IT MAY BE NEXT WEEK IT MIGHT BE NEXT SO DELAY MEANS MORE PAIN AND IT MEANS MORE PAIN THAT I CAN CONTROL IT AND I CAN GET ON WITH MY LIFE SO IT'S NOT LIFE THREATENING IN ANY WAY OR IT WAS JUST AN OUTPATIENT'S PROCEDURE AND JUST NOT TWINS YOU SAY CANCER TELL US WHY YOU DO TELL US WHY WE
LOOK TO THESE PEOPLE
FOR A WEEK IT WAS PARALYSED IN THEIR HANDS THESE THESE DOCTORS AND HER FAMILY'S LIVES AS WELL
THEY'RE HIGHLY EDUCATED IT'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND IF THEY ALL SAY THAT THIS CONTRACT THAT'S BEEN IMPOSED ON THEM
ISN'T SAFE THEN I BELIEVE IT ISN'T SAFE O.K. THANK YOU FOR THAT WILL LET'S TALK TO A DOCTOR NONE OTHER THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS WHO IS ON THE LINE FROM IPSWICH SHE'S CALLED CLAIRE MARKS MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DID YOU EVER BELIEVE YOU WOULD SEE THE DAY IN THE N.H.S. WHEN DOCTORS DIDN'T JUST CANTRELL PROCEDURES LIKE KAREN BUT WALKED OUT OF ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY AND WALKED OUT AND MATERNITY UNITS
A JUST SHOWS HOW SORRY ESTATE WE'RE AT AT THE MOMENT I DIDN'T EVER THINK WE'D GET TO THIS STAGE
IN THE CURRENT DISPUTE HAS GOT TO A LOSE LOSE SITUATION AND AS WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM KAREN IT'S PARTICULARLY PLAYING OUT ON THE PATIENTS
WHAT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT PROCEEDS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS NEW CONTRACT IN ITS CURRENT FORM IT'S LIKELY TO
INFLICT FURTHER DAMAGE ON THE WORKFORCE MORALE AND AS KAREN HAS POINTED OUT WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THESE YOUNG DOCTORS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AT SAYING IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON MORALE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM SAYING WHAT SHE SAID KAREN WHICH IS SHE BELIEVED THE WARNINGS THAT THIS CONTRACT WAS UNSAFE IS IT
WE DON'T KNOW AND I THINK THIS IS THE ISSUE AND OVER THE WEEKEND YOU WILL HAVE SEEN THAT WE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE CALL FOR HER BY THE CROSS PARTY CALL FOR A PILOT BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT IT IS LIKELY TO BE IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF
THIS CONTRACT WE WANT TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IN SOME AREAS IT IS GOING TO BE POSSIBLE TO DELIVER TRAINING AND ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE DEEP SEATED CONCERNS THAT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS HAVE ABOUT NOT ONLY THIS CONTRACT BUT THEIR WORKING LIVES AND MOST PARTICULARLY TO THE TRAINING
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS UNSAFE BUT SURELY AS A DOCTOR I WAS PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS ONE THING YOU DO KNOW IT'S UNSAFE HIS FOR DOCTORS TO WALK OUT OF ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY AND TO WALK OUT OF MATERNITY IT'S ISN'T THE TRUTH IS THAT PATIENTS ARE A RISK LIVES MIGHT BE LOST
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT TOMORROW THERE WILL BE MANY SENIOR DOCTORS WHO ARE WORKING HARD TO PROVIDE SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND WE KNOW THAT PATE PATIENTS WHO ARE IN HOSPITAL WHO COME TO HOSPITAL WE'LL HAVE
EVERY OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET WITH YOU SENIOR DOCTORS BUT WE ARE RE R. IN AND UNCHARTED TERRITORIES AND SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THERE'S AT THEM ALREADY WE KNOW THAT MANY MANY PATIENTS
JUST AS KAREN HAS HAD BEEN ACTUALLY DISADVANTAGE LAST WEEK I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE DISADVANTAGE OF BEING DELAYED FOR ELECTIVE SURGERY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE OVER ALREADY BEEN DELAYED FOR
FOR ELECTIVE SURGERY SO WE ARE VERY VERY CLEAR THAT
THE PATIENTS ARE GOING TO BE AT SOME DISADVANTAGE IT'S A BIT OUT OF THIS THIS ACTION YOU'D BE BETTER DISADVANTAGES UNDERSTATING SOMEWHAT ISN'T IT LET'S PUT THIS TO YOU PERSONALLY BECAUSE ON PART OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE WHICH ARE A PROFESSIONAL BODY HE MAY NOT WANT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ALL SURGEONS IN THAT BODY IF YOU WERE A GEORGE JUNIOR DOCTOR
WOULD YOU WALK OUT OF ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY WOULD YOU WALK OUT OF MATERNITY UNITS KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW OR NO DOCTOR WANTS TO GET INTO THIS FILTER WANTS TO FORGIVE OUT I'M ASKING YOU WHETHER YOU WOULD I
PERSONALLY WOULD NOT COUNTENANCE A SITUATION WHERE I WOULD BE WITHDRAWING MY LABOUR BUT I KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE DOCTOR WILL BE THINKING INCREDIBLY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS STAGE SO YOU WOULD NOT STRIKE YOU WOULD NOT WALK OUT WOULD YOU RATHER DOCTOR IT'S NOT TO DO THIS VERY INDIVIDUAL DECISION
EACH OF THESE DOCTORS WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS DISPUTE HAVE BEEN REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY DOCTORS WHO ARE HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTY IN JUSTIFYING WITHDRAWING LABOUR FROM EMERGENCIES AND THOSE DOCTORS UNDOUBTEDLY WILL NOT WORK WALK OUT TOMORROW I LEADERSHIP POSITION THE REASON I'M PRESSING YOU AND I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T WISH TO ABANDON COLLEAGUES YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD NOT STRIKE
ARE YOU PREPARED TO SAY IF IT WERE UP TO YOU THIS WITHDRAWAL OF LABOUR FROM ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY MATERNITY UNIT SHOULD NOT GO AHEAD
I THINK WE KNOW THAT NO DOCTOR WANTS TO BE IN THIS SORT OF SITUATION AND I WOULD JUST THE GOVERNMENT AND THE B.M.A. TO GET INTO TALKS TOGETHER TO ACTUALLY AT THIS THE VERY LAST STAGE TWO TRIED TO MAKE A RESOLUTION BY EACH OF THEM RECOGNISING THAT
PATIENTS NEED TO BE CARED FOR AND REALLY THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR BEST INTEREST IS FOR THE PATIENT AND IT'S NOT ABOUT WINNING ON EITHER SIDE AND THE MOMENT THEY'RE BOTH LUCY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME CLEMENCE PRESENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS AND WE'RE TALKING TO HEAD OF THE B.M.A. JUST BEFORE EIGHT SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW WHY DON'T THEY TELL US THE FACTS THAT'S WHAT AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN ONE A GROUP OF SENIOR ACADEMIC HAS PRODUCED A REPORT WITH THE FACT CHECKING ORGANISATION FULL FACT THAT CONFIRMS PEOPLE ARE RIGHT
TO BE CONCERNED I'M JOINED BY WILL MOI WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF FULL FACT IN THERE SIGNED THE STAND IT MY MORE YOU INVESTIGATED TWENTY FOUR CLAIMS FROM BOTH SIDES IN THE REFERENDUM AND MANY OF THEM WERE FOUND WANTING
THAT'S RIGHT WHAT WE LOOKED FOR WAS TWELVE THE BIGGEST ISSUES FOR KEEP COMING UP IN THE DEBATE THINGS LIKE IMMIGRATION AND BORDER CONTROL AND HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST THE ECONOMY WILL BENEFIT THE ECONOMY WHERE THE SIGN SEEM TO BE CLASHING WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THEN FULL FACTS ABOUT GETTING THE BEST EXPERTS IN THE COUNTRY TO GIVE US THE BEST INFORMATION WE RECOUNTS SO WE FOUND THIS GROUP OF PROFESSORS AND SAID CAN YOU HELP US FACT CHECK THESE CLAIMS
ON IMMIGRATION FOR INSTANCE LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE LEAVE CAMP IS CLAIMING WHICH IS THAT BRECK SID AND I QUOTE IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN CONTROL IMMIGRATION
THAT'S TRUE IF WE STAY IN THE WE HAVE VERY LIMITED CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION FROM THE REST OF THE E.U. BECAUSE E.U. CITIZENS HAVE THE RIGHT TO WORK AND LIVE IN ANY COUNTRY THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS IF WE LEAVE THEM THERE ARE TWO RECENT THINK IF WE DO LEAVE WE WON'T GET AS MUCH CONTROL AS OF IMMIGRATION
IMPLIES THE FIRST ONE IS SIMPLY THAT IF YOU APPLY THE SAME RULES WE CURRENTLY APPLIED TO PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE THE E.U. TO PEOPLE FROM INSIDE THE Y. THEN WE WOULDN'T EXPECT TO SEE IT FALLING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S TARGET LEVEL OF TENS OF THOUSANDS MIGRATION WATCH DID WHAT THEY WERE CALLED A BALLPARK TESTAMENT OF REDUCTION OF ONLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OUT OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IMMIGRATION THE OTHER DROP IT'S STILL A DROP BUT IF YOUR TARGET IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS IT'S NOT GOING TO GET YOU
THE OTHER REASON IS ACTUALLY DO WE HAVE THE FREEDOM TO CUT IT THAT MUCH WELL IF WE WANT TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND STAY PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET WE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT FREEDOM BASED ON WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE NORWAY HAS TO ACCEPT FREE MOVEMENT IN ORDER TO STAY PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET SO SIMPLY LEAVING THE E.U. MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH TO GIVE US CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION BUT IF THEY WERE TO ARGUE WELL IT WOULD HELP
THEY COULD ARGUE THAT THAT WE WON'T KNOW AND WHAT THEY CAN'T ARGUE IS IT IS CLEAR THAT WE CAN HAVE BOTH THE ABILITY TO BE PART OF A SINGLE MARKET AND THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT WE LIKE ON IMMIGRATION SO IT'S NOT FOR THERE IS NOTHING TO THE ARGUMENTS IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU SEEM TO NEED A DECODER RING
AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE WAKING UP ON JUNE THE TWENTY OR THINKING I MADE MY MIND UP AND NOW I FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD THE WOOL PULLED OVER MY EYES IS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR
VOTE LEAVE TO SCARE US WITH STATISTICS BECAUSE AT LEAST WITH REMAIN WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WHATEVER TO TO CHECK AT THINGS AGAINST WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
WELL I MEAN TWO THINGS FIRSTLY I DON'T THINK THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A STATUS QUO IN THIS REFERENDUM PHE E. EW IT'S GOING TO CHANGE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT TEN AND TWENTY THIRTY YEARS JUST LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD SEE VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE IDEA THAT WE CAN OPT INTO WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS PROBABLY NOT PLAUSIBLE BUT ALSO ACTUALLY THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN PUSHING SOME VERY HARD CLAIMS THAT DON'T STAND UP TO SCRUTINY IVOR
SOME OF THEIR CLAIM SOME OUT BORDER SECURITY FOR EXAMPLE WE BENEFIT HAS E.U. MEMBER STATE FROM CO OPERATING WITH OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES ON BORDER SECURITY ABSOLUTELY THAT'S TRUE THINGS LIKE THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT THAT WE OPTED INTO THE SHINGEN INFORMATION SYSTEM WHICH IS INFORMATION SHARING ABOUT BORDERS THAT WE OPTED INTO HEARTS
NORWAY HAS OPTED INTO THE SHOWING AN INFORMATION SYSTEM ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT AN E. MEMBER AND HAS SOMETHING THERE LOOKS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT SO AGAIN THE QUESTION OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE ACTUALLY DOESN'T REALLY STACK UP AS QUITE SO FRIGHTENING AS ONE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND ON THE OTHER BIG ON WE HAVEN'T GOT LONG ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH HER FOR HOURS I ACCEPT THAT NONETHELESS TREATIES TRADE TREATIES OH CRIKEY YES
THAT'LL DO IT OH CRIKEY YES I MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S
A MATTER OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGEMENT AS TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE AS TO WHAT CAN BE NEGOTIATED ON TRADE TREATIES BUT IT IS CLEAR I THINK THAT'S THE BIG ONE IS WHAT DEAL WE DO WITH THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE THING THAT GETS HIDDEN ON BOTH SIDES IS THAT WHAT DEAL WE DO ON TRADE WILL BE LINKED TO WHAT DEAL WE CAN DO WANT IMMIGRATION AND LOTS OF OTHER TOPICS AS WELL SO WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAYING THIS IS WHERE THE GRAVY IS ON ANY PARTICULAR PART OF THE ISSUE
YOU'VE GOT TO WANT TO PIN THEM DOWN ON ALL THE REST OF THE ISSUE AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE FACTS BEHIND THE CLAIMS WILL BOY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE BIG ONE FOR THE MOMENT WHILE WE STAY IN THE E.U. IS THAT DEAL POTENTIAL DEAL AT LEAST BETWEEN THE E.U. AND THE U.S. ON TRADE AND AS TEN YOU CAN TELL US THAT IS STILL BEING NEGOTIATED ABSOLUTELY AND WILL BE NEGOTIATED FOR SOME TIME TO COME BY THE SOUND OF THINGS WELL THE TRANSATLANTIC TRADE AND INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP DEAL IT'S CALLED TITI
FOR THOSE ON THE INSIDE IT ISN'T POPULAR WITH EVERYONE NOT AT ALL ON SATURDAY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MARCHED IN THE GERMAN CITY OF HANOVER AGAINST THE PROPOSED DEAL WITH ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT MAY COME OF THIS LATEST ROUND OF DISCUSSIONS THAT BEGIN TODAY IN NEW YORK IS ALLEYNE DUSAN WHO HIS PARTNER AT THE LAW FIRMS
PASSION BLOGS ARE BOGS SORRY SPECIALISING IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AT LISTENING VERY INTERESTINGLY TO THE DISCUSSION WE'VE JUST HAD ON THE PROGRAMME BUT THIS WOULD NOT MAKE THE E.U. AND THE U.S. ALMOST PART OF THE SAME TRADE BLOCK IN QUITE THE SAME WAY THAT THE U.K. IN THE E.U. IS SURELY
NO AND I DON'T THINK BUT ENOUGH OF THE NEGOTIATORS AT ALL I MEAN WHEN WHEN WE ENTERED INTO THE NEGOTIATIONS BACK IN TWENTY FOUR IT'S TWENTY THIRTEEN SORRY AT THE TUBE AND THE HENCE THE TRADE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE E.U. AND THE U.S. FROM OBVIOUSLY MAJOR TRENT PARTNERS INTERFACE YOU NEED TATE'S ACCESS MARKET ACCESS FORM E. YO EXPLOITER IS WHEN PLACING THEM INTO THE U.S. MARKET AND THE OTHER WAY AROUND
AIDS WILL NEVER BE EACH AND GO FOR A MAJOR ECONOMY INTEGRATION THAT WILL HAVE SOME SORT OF THREE MOVEMENTS IDEAS THAT WE HAVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OF COURSE BUT WHY IS IT SUCH A BIG DEAL THEN TRYING TO CUT THIS PARTICULAR TRADE DEAL WE CUT THEM WITH OTHER COUNTRIES ALL THE TIME THAT'S QUITE RIGHT AND FREE TREAD IS ALWAYS ON TOP OF POLITICAL ARE OBVIOUSLY ALWAYS GATHERS A LOT OF INTEREST AND FUN FUND OFF IN THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE
I THINK IT'S IT'S IT IS A MAJOR TRADE DEAL SO IT CREATES A LOT OF INTEREST SO BIG DEVELOP MARKETS WITH A LOT OF THEIR OWN RULES EXACTLY AND WHEN WE ENTERED ENSUED IN THE IN INTO THE NEGOTIATIONS THE WHOLE IDEA WAS THAT EVERYTHING WAS ON THE TABLE SO IT WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON ALL THIS SECTOR IS STEPS ARE OPENED FOR NEGOTIATIONS O.K. SO ON THE UPSIDE THE Y. YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO EXPORT MORE EASILY TO THE U.S. WITHOUT HAVING TO ADOPT DIFFERENT STANDARDS
THE REVERSE IS THAT THE U.S. WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING THIS IS THE CONCERN ABOUT JOBS YES EXACTLY I MEAN THE WHOLE IDEA IS THE MORE YOU CREATES THE MORE TRADE YOU CREATE THE MORE EMPLOYMENT YOU CREATOR OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHY THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF INTEREST COMING FUND DIZZINESS OR GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT WE ACHIEVE BEFORE THEY'RE TWENTY SIXTEEN TIME LINE AND INDECENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TELL ME OF THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHEN WE CHOOSE WHICH NURSERY TO SEND OUR CHILDREN TO OUR MAIN CONCERNS ARE PROBABLY THAT THEY ARE SAFE AND HAPPY THERE BUT THE GOVERNMENT BROUGHT IN NEW RULES LAST SEPTEMBER STIPULATING
THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN NURSERIES MUST HAVE AT LEAST A C. PASSING GHQ SEEN ENGLISH AND MATHS AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE CHARITY LONDON EARLY YEARS FOUNDATION HAS CREATED A CRISIS WELL I'M JOINED BY JUNE O'SULLIVAN FROM THE LONDON EARLY YEARS FOUNDATION WHAT SORT OF CRISIS IN WHAT SENSE
RECRUITMENT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM SO THE GOVERNMENT WANTS US TO EXPAND PROVISION WITH THIRTY HOURS AND ALSO TO US MORE CHILDREN ARE DISADVANTAGED TWO YEAR OLDS IN PARTICULAR AND WE SIMPLY CAN'T GET STAFF WE SAW SEVENTY PER CENT DROP IN IN STAFF APPLYING TO DO THEIR LEVEL THREE QUALIFICATION SINCE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
SO WE'RE NOT AGAINST HAVING A C. GHQ SEE MATT AND ENGLISH WE JUST DON'T THINK IT'S THAT RELEVANT SO WE WANT THE REINTRODUCTION OF THE FUNCTIONAL SKILLS WHERE WE ACTUALLY CAN
PREPARE STAFF BETTER IN FACT BUT IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR WHOSE I'VE IN FACT IT IS YES THIS IS THE PROBLEM AND SO NINETY SIX PERCENT OF OUR APPRENTICES DROPPED IN THE YEAR NINETEEN NINETY SIX PER CENT BECAUSE THEY WERE ASKED TO GO AND EH TO SEE G.C.S.E. MATHS AND ENGLISH APPRENTICES THE ONLY APPRENTICE GROUP THAT HAS TO DO THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE YOU'RE SORT OF WHAT THEY MIGHT CALL THEIR EACH A PIPELINE SO WILL BEGIN TO DRY UP VERY QUICKLY ALSO
FOR MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WE NEED TO TEACH THEM MUCH MORE AROUND SOFT SKILLS AND PREPARATIONS GOES FOR WORK AND STUFF AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TEACHING CHILDREN TO START WITH THEY'RE NOT WE'RE GOING TO TRAIN THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE GOOD QUALITY REALLY DEPENDS ON GOOD QUALIFIED STAFF
BUT YOU NEED TO GET THEM IN AND YOU NEED TO SORT OF PREPARED THEM AND AN APPRENTICESHIP IS ONE WAY OF DOING AN HOUR OR A STRAIGHTFORWARD QUALIFICATION LIKE A DIPLOMAS ANOTHER WAY OF DOING IT BUT BECAUSE THE BARRIER TO ENTRY IS NOW A. TO C. G.C.S.E. MATHS AND ENGLISH
IT'S BECOMING A REAL PROBLEM AND ALSO TO SOME DEGREE IT'S IT'S IT IS A KIND OF A BIG ASK FOR AN EMPLOYER SO THEY AT THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT WE GO AND THE THROUGH THE LEVEL THREE AND GET THEM THEIR G.C.S.E. MATHS AND ENGLISH WHEN THEY'VE BEEN TO SCHOOL FOR I DON'T KNOW ELEVEN YEARS YES THAT DOESN'T THAT TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE SORT OF CANDIDATE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT VERY BASIC QUALIFICATIONS THEN MAYBE THEY'RE NOT THE RIGHT PEOPLE BE DOING THIS IS A VERY DEMANDING JOB IT'S A IT'S A REALLY REALLY GOOD QUESTION BUT OF FACT
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THERE IS NO RESEARCH THAT SAYS HAVING YOUR G.C.S.E. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY PREPARES YOU FOR THE KIND OF MATHEMATICAL TEACHING YOU DO FOR SMALL CHILDREN WHICH ACTUALLY IS QUITE COMPLEX BUT IT'S DIFFERENT YOU KNOW COLOUR COUNTING VOLUME MEASUREMENT ALL OF THOSE THINGS I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE I'M SURE SOME MATHEMATICIANS WILL ARE YOU WITH ME HERE BUT WHERE THE PYTHAGORAS'S THEOREM ACTUALLY GETS YOU INTO THAT SPACE SO IT'S THEIR PARENTS THERE ARE SOME IT'S OTHER THINGS AS ABOUT
LISTENING AND YOU KNOW HOW THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CONCENTRATE AND PERSEVERE AND THERE'S ALSO YOU KNOW THERE ARE ONLY TWO A LOT OF THEM SO THEY'RE ONLY BABIES AND SO WE HAVE TO SORT OF THINK ABOUT THE BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT GOOD CHILDCARE I.E. LOOKING AFTER THEM MAKING THEM FEEL NURTURED AND CARED FOR AND INTRODUCING THEM TO LANGUAGE
AND EXPANDING THEIR OR HOLD YOU KNOW REPERTOIRE COS THEY'RE BRIGHT LITTLE BUNNIES ON IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO GET THEM REALLY MOVING UP THE KIND OF YOU KNOW EDUCATIONAL CHAIN SO TO SPEAK BUT SULLIVAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU THANK YOU
IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN MCCARTHY AND HER SEAGRIM IS HERE WITH THE SPOT IS NOT GOOD MORNING US IN THE LAST HOUR THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES STORIES I COULD STYLE WITH LET'S MIX IT UP AND BEGIN WITH CRYSTAL PALACE THIS TIME THEY ARE INTO ONLY THEIR SECOND F.A. CUP FINAL IN THE CLUB'S HISTORY THEY WERE FACE MANCHESTER UNITED AS THEY DID ON THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE IN NINETEEN NINETY THE CRYSTAL PALACE MANAGER ALAN PARTY WAS PLEASED WITH THE MANNER OF THEIR SEMI FINAL TWO ONE WIN OVER WATFORD THE GAME PLAN WE PUT TOGETHER NEEDS TO BE DELIVERED TO THE LETTER IT WAS DELIVERED AN APART
PERIOD WHEN THEY SCORE ABOUT FIVE TEN MINUTES WE ARE TOTAL CONTROL OF THE GAME
SOME GREAT PERFORMANCES AND WE DESERVE TO BE IN THE FINAL I THOUGHT WE WERE A BETTER TEAM TODAY IN ALL THE ROUNDS ABOUT TOUGH TOUGH DRAW
AND WERE THERE AND WE PLAY IN THE BIGGEST CLUB IN THE WORLD AND THAT FEELS GOOD SO LET'S MEET AT THE B.B.C.'S ALLEGORY SPALL WHO WAS COMMENTATING ON THAT MATCH AT WEMBLEY GOOD MORNING ELLIE GOOD MORNING PALACE HAVEN'T REALLY HAVEN'T EASY ROUTE TO THE FINAL HAVE THEY CAN YOU PUT INTO CONTEXT WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEM TO HAVE GOT TO THE F.A. CUP FINAL FOR THE CLUB
YEAH WELL COMPARED TO THEIR LEAGUE FORM IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS SEASON THEY'VE HAD ONE WIN IN EIGHTEEN LEAGUE GAMES YET THEY'VE BEATEN THE LIKES OF TOTTENHAM ON THIS CUP RUN MAYBE WATFORD YESTERDAY AT WEMBLEY THEY BEAT SOUTHAMPTON ANOTHER PREMIER LEAGUE TEAM EARLIER IN THE COMPETITION SO THE THE FORM BETWEEN THE TWO COMPETITIONS FOR THEM HAS BEEN MARKED AND AS YOU SAID IN YOUR INTRODUCTION THEY'VE NEVER WON THE F.A. CUP THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND FINAL BUT I'VE EVER BEEN IN SO FOR THIS GROUP OF PLAYERS IS A CHANCE
TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY TO BECOME THE FIRST GROUP OF PLAYERS TO WIN THE F.A. CUP FOR CRYSTAL PALACE SO IT'S HUGE FOR THEM AND THAT FIRST CUP FINAL WAS A THREE OR THRILLER THAT WENT TO A REPLAY EVENTUALLY WON BY UNITED HOW MUCH WILL REVENGE BE ON THEIR MINDS AFTER ALL THIS TIME WELL I THINK PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL PALACE MANAGER IS ALAN WHO FAMOUSLY SCORED THE WINNER IN THEIR SEMI FINAL TWENTY SIX YEARS AGO TO GET THEM TO THE FINAL YOU KNOW AND NOW IS THE THE MANAGER AT THE SIDE UP AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED AND I WAS INTERESTED TO HEAR ALAN YESTERDAY IMMEDIATELY SUGGESTING
BUT LOUIS VANGUARD THE MANCHESTER UNITED MANAGER IS UNDER SIMILAR PRESSURE TO THE PRESSURE THAT SIR ALEX FERGUSON WAS UNDER BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY BECAUSE AT THAT POINT HE HADN'T WON A TROPHY PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT HIM LOSING HIS JOB SO IT LOOKS LIKE ALAN PARTY WAS STARTED THE MIND GAMES EARLIER I WOULD SUGGEST HER HONEYED MENTIONED JUST BRIEFLY THEY LEAGUE POSITION OF CRYSTAL PALACE NO AND SIXTEENTH WITH THIS CUP RUN A LOT OF CLUBS NOW LOOK AT WHAT LEICESTER ARE DOING BEING TOP OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE AND THINK IN A YEAR'S TIME THAT COULD BE US I THINK
THE TELEVISION MONEY THESE CLUBS WILL GET NEXT SEASON FROM BEING IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE WILL ONLY HELP THEM FURTHER AS THEY TRY AND CLOSE THE GAP ON THE MEGA RICH CLUBS AND ACTUALLY CRYSTAL PALACE THIS SEASON AT CHRISTMAS TIME WERE COMPETING FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE PLACES THEY'VE HAD THIS DIP IN FORM THEY HAVEN'T BEEN HELPED BY INJURIES BUT I THINK IT JUST SHOWS YOU WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY THE LIKES OF LES THE PALACE SHE LOOK AT WEST HAM MOVING INTO THEIR NEW STADIUM NEXT SEASON AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT ONLY MAKES THE LANDSCAPE OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL
MORE INTERESTING GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALISTAIR SCHOOL NOW MENTION LEICESTER PLAYER REAR MURRES WON THE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION'S PLAYER OF THE YEAR AWARD LAST NIGHT CAP OF AN EXCELLENT DAY FOR THE CLUB TOTTENHAM'S DELI ELLIE WAS NAMED THE YOUNG PLAYER OF THE AIR AND MANCHESTER CITY FORWARD IS THE CHRISTIANS AND THE WOMEN'S AWARD LEICESTER ARE EIGHT POINTS CLEAR AT THE TOP OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE AFTER A FOUR NIL WIN OVER SWANSEA BUT SECOND PLACE TOTTENHAM COULD CUT THAT TO FIVE POINTS TONIGHT

IS THAT OLD FASHIONED AND OUT OF DATE I DO IN BRITISH HOME STORES YES WHY I FIND IT VERY TRADITIONAL WHILST TAKING US MY LOVE OUR A GRANDMOTHER MY MOTHER
AND HOPE YOU'LL BE MUCH SOUNDS LIKE YOU TRUST IT YES I DO IT ABOUT DE A THA MI FAICINN EH SO I GO TO PAM UP TO TO PUT SURMISES BRITAIN WELL BY THE NAME FOR A START SO I THINK WE SHOULD
HOPE LITTLE KEEP GOING YOU SURPRISED THOUGH THAT IT'S AT RISK I'M NOT SURPRISED I THINK IT'S SUCH A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SHAME IT'S NOT STYLISH ENOUGH BRITISH HOME STORES
ESSENTIAL ACTUAL BASICALLY IN BLACK WHITE SHIRL YOU GO WRONG BUT YOU CAN'T
WELL THERE'S A FEW SHOPPERS PASSING THEIR VERDICT LET'S TALK PACKS WITH ME TO NICK HOOD WHO IS THE BUSINESS RISK ADVISER AT THE INSOLVENCY PRACTITIONERS OPUS HE'S BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON IT THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR EMMA AND JOHN LEWIS WHO HAS BEEN A BIT ABOUT IT JOHN HAMMOND IS THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE SHOE SHOP WORKERS UNION AS DOOR MY THIS IS ASK YOU FIRST WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN NOW I'M A PART OF THAT WE WANT TO KEEP THIS DROPPED OPEN OBVIOUSLY
WELL REALLY WE WANT TO DIALOGUE WE WE NEED A CONVERSATION WE NEED TO UNRAVEL ON PICK WHAT THE POSITION IS WE KNOW IT'S SERIOUS WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY OF COURSE TO DRAW MEMBERS THERE'S ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WOKE UP TO SMALLMAN UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE FUTURE SO CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE AND LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE
AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO THAT IS WOOD INVITED INTO THOSE TALKS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE RIGHT NICK HOOD WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS HAD DISTINCTLY LIMITED JOHN I MEAN THIS IS A BUSINESS THAT HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY UNDER INVESTED IN OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IT WAS LOST FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION POUNDS IN THERE SIX AND A HALF YEARS UP TO A POINT WHEN IT WAS SOLD TO THE CURRENT OWNERS AND IN RETAIL THESE DAYS IS ALL ABOUT
UM HEAVY INVESTMENT IN STAYING UP WITH THE TREND ONLINE OFFERINGS MOBILE OFFERINGS AND NONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED AND AT B.H.S. AND THIS HAS AWFUL ECHOES OF WHAT YOU AND I WERE DISCUSSING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OVER THE DEMISE OF WOOLWORTHS ANOTHER RETAIL BUSINESS THAT HASN'T STAYED UP WITH THE TIMES AND USE THE NOBODY OUT THERE YOU CAN SEE WHO MIGHT WANT TO BUY IT OR AT LEAST BUY SOME OF IT
I THINK THERE'S EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT THE THE THESE STORES WILL BE CHERRY PIT I MEAN THERE ARE SOME PROFITABLE STORES IN THE RIGHT LOCATIONS AND THERE ARE ALWAYS BUYERS OUT THERE FOR THOSE SORTS OF RETAIL SITES I MEAN THEY'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSION I UNDERSTAND OVER THE WEEKEND WITH THE TEAM AT SPORTS DIRECT MY CASHED HIS BUSINESS AND A CHERRY PICKER OF
A DECENT RETAIL SITES SO SOME OF THESE STORES WILL BE SAVED AND THE JOBS WITH THEM WILL ALSO BE SAVED BUT ULTIMATELY WE'VE GOT ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS AT RISK HERE AND HAVE THE PENSIONS OF TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IT'S IT IT'S A DISASTER AND THE THING ABOUT THE PENSION FUND IS THAT IT IS IN DEFICIT TO HAVE HUGE AMOUNT
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE PAST ACCOUNTS OF B.H.S. THIS DEFICIT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS BUT OF COURSE WHEN YOU GET INTO THIS SITUATION WHERE THE PENSION HAS TO BE CRYSTALLISED IT GOES INTO THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND THE THE FIGURE I THINK IS FIVE ON AT THE SEVENTY SIX MILLION POUNDS FOR THE DEFICIT JUST ESCALATES BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO SORT OF BUY THEIR PENSIONS IT'S ALL VERY TECHNICAL CAN THEY GO AFTER PHILIP GREEN FOR ANY OTHER
THE MAN WHO WILL BE WHEN I SOLD IT FOR A POUND A THING IS THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN SELL A BUSINESS WITH A PENSION FUND BUT A BIT LIKE THE HOTEL CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHECK OUT BUT YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE AND THIS THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND WILL BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE SITUATION AND IT'S IN A POSITION TO ISSUE CONTRIBUTION NOTICES TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH THAT
THE FUND SO I THINK THE INITIAL OFFER THAT I BELIEVE SIR PHILIP MADE OF FORTY MILLION POUNDS AND A LOAN OF FORTY MILLION POUNDS ON ON TOP WON'T CUT THE MUSTARD I THINK I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE WHO WILL BE A MUCH HIGHER CONTRIBUTION REQUIRED JOHN HELLO IMPRESSED DEPRESSED WITH ANYTHING YOU'VE HEARD OF THAT
A COMBINATION OF ALL I THINK I THINK FOR US WE NEED TO REALLY GET INTO THAT CONVERSATION I MEAN I THINK THIS IS SERIOUS I THINK THE OPTIONS MAY BE LIMITED BUT I THINK WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY GIVE THAT REASSURANCE THAT
THE UNION IS INVOLVED WE ARE REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF THE WORKERS THIS IS DEVASTATING NEWS IT IS A KIND OF REMINDER OF THE WORK SITUATION AND SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHEN COMPANIES GO INTO RECEIVERSHIP IF IT DOES THAT IS THE CASE FOR MOST IMPORTANTLY LET'S HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO REPRESENT THOSE PEOPLE WHO TODAY I'M SURE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TALKING TO YOU HAVE THEY
NOT YET WE'RE HERE IN BLACKPOOL AT A CONFERENCE MAKE IN THE CONTACT ARE REACHING OUT WE'RE ASKING TO BE INVOLVED WE DON'T WANT TO BE THERE JUST LISTENED TO THE REPORTS WE WANT TO LET'S SAY I'D EXPERIENCE OF THE RETAIL SECTOR AND MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOME DIALOGUE AND SOME ASSISTANCE FOR THESE PEOPLE RIGHT THERE WERE DEVASTATED AND HE COULD THE NEXT IMMEDIATE STEP IS WHAT
ONLY TO IT'LL BE THE APPOINTMENT OF ADMINISTRATORS PROBABLY SOMETIME THIS MORNING THEY WILL TAKE CONTROL AND THEY WOULD GO LOOKING FOR A BUYER BUT THEY WILL AT ME THEY WILL SEEK TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESSES OPEN BECAUSE IF THERE IS ANY HOPE OF
OF GETTING THE BEST VALUE FOR THE CREDITORS AND PRESERVING THE MOST JOBS HERE THOSE STORES HAVE GOT TO STAY OPEN BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT SUPPLIER WILL SUPPLY EXCEPT FOR CASH AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THIS CAN STAY AT THIS OPEN AND STAY UPRIGHT FOR VERY LONG NICK HOOD JOHN HAMMOND THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
IT'S TWENTY TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE DAILY MAIL SAYS IT'S HORRIFIED BY THE JUNIOR DOCTORS ALL OUT STRIKE IN ENGLAND CALLING IT BLACKMAIL THAT DEMEANS THEIR PROFESSION BUT HE'D ALSO WITH LIVES AT STAKE THE HEALTH SECRETARY SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE CROSS PARTY PLAN FOR TRIALS OF THE NEW CONTRACT THE GUARDIAN THINKS JEREMY HUNT'S DISMISSAL OF THE INITIATIVE WAS ARROGANT AND HIGH HANDED

BOSSES HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN A LETTER TO WORKERS SAY THEY'VE BEEN UNABLE TO SECURE FUNDING OR TO FIND A BUYER
IT ARGUES THAT SIR PHILIP GREEN WHO SOLD THE COMPANY FOR JUST A POUND LAST YEAR SHOULDN'T ABANDON HIS FORMER EMPLOYEES THOSE WHO BANK FAT PROFITS IN GOOD TIMES IT SAYS SHOULD HELP WHEN TIMES ARE BAD TIMES REPORTS ON A U. TURN THAT IT SAYS THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN IS PREPARING ON THE PLAN ANNOUNCED LAST MONTH TO FORCE ALL ENGLISH STATE SCHOOLS TO BECOME ACADEMIES SO HE'S THE BEST PERFORMING COUNCILS COULD BE ALLOWED TO RUN THEIR OWN ACADEMY CHAINS IN THE CONCESSION TO UP TO FORTY CONSERVATIVE REBELS

BECAUSE COUNCIL WORKERS ARE USING IT TO KILL WEEDS THE CITY COUNCILLORS OPTED TO SPRAY THE VINEGAR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO A WEED KILLER LINKED TO CANCER RESIDENTS HAVE COMPLAINED THEY NOW HAVE WEEDY PAVEMENT AND THE SMELL OF VINEGAR IN UNEXPECTED PLACES
COUNCIL SPOKESWOMAN WAS TOLD THE TELEGRAPH THAT IT WILL MONITOR FEEDBACK IT'S LITTLE SNIFFS A LOT THEY'VE CRYING I SUPPOSE ALL RIGHT IF YOU'RE GOT A LOMBARDY GOING S'POSE YOU HAVE TO PUT VINEGAR ON YOUR CHIPS WHEN THE IODINE CAP SURFACE WISHED PROVIDE SALT AS WELL
SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THE LEADER OF THE KURDISH MILITARY THE P.K.K. IS TOLD THE B.B.C. HE'S PREPARED TO ESCALATE THE WAR IN TURKEY IN LESS THERE ARE NEGOTIATIONS PEACE TALKS WITH ANCHOR HER BREAKDOWN LAST YEAR SINCE THEN MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE FIGHTING IS DISPLAYS OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND SPEAK EXCLUSIVELY TO THE B. B. C. FROM HIS MOUNTAIN HIDEOUT IN NORTHERN IRAQ GEMMILL BI IG HAS TOLD OUR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT IN PANEL THAN UNLESS THERE'S A CEASEFIRE HIS FIGHTERS WERE ESCALATE THE WAR ACROSS TURKEY
THERE'S A BATTLE RAGING IN TURKEY WITH GOVERNMENT FORCES ON ONE SIDE AND KURDISH MILITANTS ON THE OTHER
IT'S A CONFLICT THE WORLD HAS BARELY NOTICE
LAST SUMMER OF PEACE PROCESS BETWEEN TWO ALL DAY
THE TURKISH MILITARY HAS POUNDED KURDISH TOWNS AND CITIES
LED BY THE P.K.K. HAVE RESPONDED WITH THEIR OWN ROUND OF BLOODSHED
OVER ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS AND NOW THE WALLS MOVED BEYOND THE KURDISH NAMED AND INTO TURKEY'S MENACES
KURDISH SUICIDE BOMBERS HAVE BROUGHT TERROR AND DEATH TO THE NATION'S CAPITAL TARGETING INTEREST SOLDIERS AT CIVILIANS BOO COME ON
ACTUALLY WE'VE JUST BEEN DRIVING IT PROBABLY FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR UP INTO
THE HILLS OF THE CANDLE MOUNTAINS THE VERY TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE STILL COVERED IN SNOW THERE ARE WILD HORSES TO MY RIGHT BUGGER
I JUST STARTS TO MAKE OUT THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF P.K.K. FIGHTERS HIDDEN IN THE TREES HERE WITH RIFLE SLUNG OVER THEIR SHOULDERS
IN A CLEARING AMID WILD CHERRY TREES AND A FLOCK OF SHEEP WAS THE MOST WANTED MAN IN TURKEY JIMMY'LL BY THE MAN WHO LEADS THE P.K.K.
HE SAYS HE'S FIGHTING TO DEFEND KURDISH RIGHT HE'S ANGRY SAYS HE HEADS A TERRORIST GROUP THAT SLAUGHTERS CIVILIANS SOMETHING HE DENIES HIS BLOODY LEMON
WE ON DAMPEN ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS BUTTON UP AGAINST SOLDIERS IT'S A WAR AND THEY ARE FIGHTING
ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS HEY BUT IT COULD DO WITH THE PIER KILKEE THE GROUP CALLED TUK HE'S RESPONSIBLE AND THEY'RE A DIFFERENT ORGANISATION
TURKISH GOVERNMENT SAYS THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE P.K.K. THEY CLAIM TO BE A DIFFERENT GROUP BUT THEY'RE REALLY PART OF YOUR ORGANISATION
THAT THE TURKISH STATE IS MISLEADING BETA NATION COMMUNITY ONE ANODYNE IS KERRINE CANNOT GENOCIDE SORT OF TALK WITH CONTINUED TO OPERATE AND NO ONE CAN EASILY STOPPED
ACROSS THIS PART OF THE CANDLE MOUNTAINS AS YOU'RE TRAVELLING THROUGH EVERY NOW AND AGAIN YOU SEE THE REMAINS OF WHAT USED TO BE A BUILDING THE HOUSE THERE'S RUBBLE STREWN ACROSS THE GROUND IN SOME PARTS ARE HUGE CHUNKS OF SHRAPNEL EVEN THE TREES HERE HAVE BEEN SCARRED BY THE BOMB LANDED HERE FROM TURKISH FIGHTERS
THIS IS ONE MORE CONFLICT IN AN ALREADY TROUBLED AREA THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T NEED AND IT'S NOT JUST DISPLACEMENT AND THE BLOODSHED IS NOT JUST THE THREAT TO THE STABILITY OF TURKEY
BUT THIS CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TURKISH STATE AND THE P.K.K. ALSO AFFECTS THE WARS GOING ON IN SYRIA AND IRAQ AND THE EFFORTS TO TRY AND DEGRADE AND DEFEAT THE MILITANTS HAVE THE ISLAMIC STATE GREW
NEW RECRUITS OF THE PEOPLE O.K. TRAINING TO FIGHT IN A RACK TO WHERE THEY'VE JOINED A LOOSE COALITION OF GROUPS AND COUNTRIES ARRAYED AGAINST ISIS NEAR THE OIL RICH CITY OF KIT
BRITAIN AND AMERICA SAY THEY DON'T TALK TO THE P.K.K. THEY DO HAVE CLOSE LINKS WITH OTHER KURDISH GROUPS AND THAT ANNOYS ANCHOR
THE WEST FACES A DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY DILEMMA IF IT EMBRACES THE KERBS TOO CLOSELY IT'LL ALIENATE TURKEY BUT IF IT DISTANCES ITSELF FROM THE CURDS THAT IT RISKS UNDERMINING THE WAR AGAINST ISIS BECAUSE THE WEST NEEDS KURDISH FIGHTERS ON THE GROUND
AND THE P.K.K. IS JIMMY WOULD BY ECK HAS A WARNING ABOUT WHAT LIES AHEAD THIS SUMMER WHICH WILL ONLY FURTHER STRAIN RELATIONS WITH TURKEY AND EFFORTS TO DEFEAT ISIS I'VE GOT ONE I'VE GOT IS ESCALATING HE WAS CURSED TO SARANDA
IF THEY DON'T KILL ALL CUTS SO OF COURSE THE PAIR ESCALATE THE WAR THAT'S ONLY IN THE KURDISH AREAS BUT THE CROSS TURKEY
IF TURKEY IT'S UP IT'S GENOCIDE OF POLITICS AT CHOOSERS NEGOTIATIONS WE ARE READY BUT TURKEY'S PRESIDENT HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE ISN'T READY HE'S RULED OUT ANY NEGOTIATIONS THE P.K.K. WON'T ACCEPT A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE
THIS INTRANSIGENCE IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO ANOTHER LAWN BLOOD
THE END PANEL REPORTING THERE WILL BE HERE IN THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE IN THE NEXT HOUR AND AT TEN TO EIGHT IT IS TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND DID A YORK STUDIO THIS MORNING HE'S A BISHOP JAMES JONES GOOD MORNING JAMES GOOD MORNING JOHN
I LOVE THE GUY SAID THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WINSTON CHURCHILL EXPLAINING WHY HE HAD MOVED HIM OUT OF THE OVAL OFFICE UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND REPLACED HIM WITH A BUST OF MARTIN LUTHER KING TO REMIND HIM OF THOSE WHO'D STRUGGLED FOR A NEW WORLD SO THAT SOMEONE LIKE HIM COULD ONE DAY BECOME PRESIDENT
WHEN MARTIN LUTHER KING TOLD THE CROWDS HE HAD A DREAM IT STOP SHORT OF PAINTING A SCENE OF A BLACK PRESIDENT AND A WHITE QUEEN SHAKING HANDS ON AN EQUAL FOOTING
THE BACKDROP FOR THE STATE VISIT A CASTLE A DRAWBRIDGE TO OTHER CENTURIES WHEN A WHITE EMPIRE MADE MUCH OF ITS WEALTH THROUGH TRADING AND BLACK SLAVES
THESE ISSUES CAME HOME TO ME LAST WEEK WHEN I WAS ASKED BY A LEADING BUSINESS TO SPEAK AT A SESSION ON DIVERSITY I BEGAN BY CONFESSING THAT I FELT A BIT OF A HYPOCRITE BEING PART OF AN INSTITUTION THAT HAD A POOR TRACK RECORD ON RACE AND GENDER I USE MY TALK TO TRACE HOW MY OWN VIEWS HAD CHANGED
HOW IN LIVERPOOL I'D LISTENED INTENTLY TO THE EXPERIENCES OF THE TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD BLACK COMMUNITY AND NOW FOR THE BICENTENNIAL OF THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADE I'D STUDIED CONTEMPORANEOUS ACCOUNTS OF THE BRUTALITY AND BEEN ALMOST PHYSICALLY SICK
WE CAME TO SEE THAT IF THE MINISTRY OF A BISHOP WAS TO FEED THE BODY OF CHRIST WHICH IS THE CHURCH THAN THE FIRST PERSON WHO ACTUALLY DID THIS IN THE FLESH WAS JESUS'S MOTHER MARY AND IF A WOMAN COULD DO THIS PHYSICALLY SHE COULD ALSO DO IT SPIRITUALLY
AND WHEN IT CAME TO THE CHURCH AND GAY PEOPLE I SAID THAT THE TWO PILLARS OF MOST RELIGIONS WERE TRUTH AND LOVE
AND YOU CAN'T BE TRUE TO THE TRUTH IF YOU CAN'T BE TRUE ABOUT YOURSELF AND OF GOD IS THEY CONCEIVE OR OF LOVE HE USED TO BE FOUND WHEREVER TRUE LOVE LIES
THEN CAME THE QUESTIONS WHAT DID IT COST YOU TO CHANGE YOUR MIND ONE YOUNG WOMAN ASKED
FRIENDSHIPS I REPLIED WHEN WE BEGIN TO THINK DIFFERENTLY SOME RELATIONSHIPS CHANGE
WHAT DID THAT DO TO YOU SHE PERSISTED SADNESS I CONCEITED BUT SEEING BARACK OBAMA THIS WEEKEND ENGAGING WITH A MULTI RACIAL CROWD OF YOUNG BRITISH LEADERS HAS HE REHEARSED THE PROGRESS IN THE STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS FILLED ME WITH HOPE AGAIN
THE SCENE ECHOED A QUOTE FROM SHAKESPEARE'S THE TEMPEST WHEN MIRANDA SAYS
HOW MANY GOODLY CREATURES ARE THEY HERE HOW BEAUTEOUS MANKIND IS THOUGH BRAVE NEW WORLD THAT HAS SUCH PEOPLE IN IT
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BISHOP JAMES JONES THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO IT I COULD NOT WITHDRAW MY LABOUR SAY SAID THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME THAT IT'S HER DECISION THOUSANDS OF JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE NOW FACING AS THEY CONTEMPLATE WHETHER TO JOIN THE FIRST JUNIOR DOCTOR STRIKE IN THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND IN WHICH EMERGENCY COVER WILL NOT BE PROVIDED THE STRIKE BEGINS TOMORROW MORNING AT NINE O'CLOCK
JOINED ON THE LINE BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE B.M.A. BY DOCTOR MARK PORTER MORNING TO YOU DOCTOR PORTER GOOD MORNING YOU ARE BY TRAINING AND ANITA SAYS DO YOU SPECIALISE IN PAEDIATRIC MATERNITY SERVICES COULD YOU WOULD YOU WALK OUT ON MOTHERS IN LABOUR FACING COMPLICATIONS OR A CHILD FACING SERIOUS PAIN
THE VERY FIRST THING I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT YOU SAID SOMETHING WRONG IN YOUR INTRODUCTION IT IS NOT TRUE THAT EMERGENCY CARE IS BEING WITHDRAWN ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY IT IS TRUE THAT JUNIOR DOCTORS WON'T BE PROVIDING IT BUT HOSPITALS ACROSS ENGLAND WILL BE FULL OF SENIOR DOCTORS SUCH AS MY COLLEAGUES WHO WILL BE DELIVERING THAT CARE HAD YOU ADOPTED YOU TAKEN OR DO YOU ACTUALLY DO YOU KNOW THAT IS WHAT I WOULD LOOK AT ME SHE'S THE CLARITY JUNIOR DOCTORS HAVE MADE A DECISION THE FIRST TIME IN THIS DISPUTE THAT THEY WILL NOT BE INVOLVED THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE STRIKE OF COURSE IN PROVIDING EMERGENCY COVER
THAT'S CORRECT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT COVER WILL NOT BE PROVIDED AND THAT SENIOR DOCTORS WILL BE IN A PROVIDING THAT COVER SO WHAT WOULD YOU ASK WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO DO IT I WOULD LOOK AT A GOVERNMENT THAT DISTORTED THE RESEARCH AND STATISTICS TO BUTTRESS IT'S NON EXISTENT CASE ON THIS I'D LOOK AT A GOVERNMENT THAT'S REFUSED TO LISTEN TO ROYAL COLLEGE ADVICE AND INDEED IGNORED PUBLIC OPINION ON THIS AND I WOULD LOOK AROUND AT SEA AS I SAID JUST NOW THE SENIOR DOCTORS WHO WERE MY COLLEAGUES IN AND PROVIDING SAFE CARE OF COURSE I WOULD NICK OF COURSE I WOULD
SO YOU WOULD WALK OUT FACED BY A PATIENT WITH WHOM YOU HAVE THE EXPERTISE YOU HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP YOU WERE TO EXPLAIN TO THAT MOTHER IN PAIN OR THE PARENTS OF A CHILD IN PAIN THE CHILD ITSELF I'M SORRY BECAUSE OF DISPUTE I'VE GOT I'M NOT GOING TO TREAT YOU
NICK WHAT I WOULD DO IN THIS INDUSTRIAL ACTION AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT LOOKING AROUND AT THIS INDUSTRIAL ACTION FIRST OF ALL MIKE SENIOR DOCTOR COLLEAGUES IN THE HYPOTHETICAL CASE I WAS HERE
MY SENIOR DOCTOR COLLEAGUES WOULD BE PROVIDING THAT CARE WOULD BE PROVIDING IT IN A WAY THAT I WOULD TRUST SO I WOULD ALSO LOOK AT A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS GIVEN JUNIOR DOCTORS NO CHOICE OTHER THAN THIS PETITIONS DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT DEBATE IN PUBLIC INDUSTRIAL ACTION THAT DIDN'T INVOLVE EMERGENCIES THE GOVERNMENT HAS IGNORED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE THAT LEFT YOU NEED DOCTORS WITH NO ALTERNATIVE OF THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED SO THERE'LL A WEE WARNING THAT LIVES ARE AT RISK THE WARNING MADE BY THE HEALTH SECRETARY ENGLAND IT'S NONSENSE
THE HEALTH SECRETARY IS TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO THROW MUD AT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS WITH THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WEEKEND NIGHT EMERGENCY COVER SINCE THE ESSENCE OR COULD HE BE RIGHT SINCE THE N.H.S. STARTED SURE THAT'S THE POLITICS WHAT'S THE REALITY PATIENT CARE ABOUT THE REALITY OR ARE YOU SAYING LIVES ARE NOT CATEGORICALLY NOT AT RISK
THE REALITY IS THAT WE HAVE ADVISED OUR MEMBERS TO TAKE PART IN CONTINGENCY PLANNING AT THE N.H.S. HAS PUT IN PLACE A MAGNIFICENT EFFORT OF CONTINGENCY PLANNING TO MAKE SURE THAT SAFE EMERGENCY CARE WILL BE DELIVERED ON TUESDAY WEDNESDAY BUT GET DELIVERED BY CONSULTANTS AND STUFF AND ASSOCIATE SPECIALTY DOCTORS
YOU'VE BEEN INVITED TO TALK BY THE HEALTH SECRETARY CAN WE BE CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE REFUSED TO TALK BECAUSE YOU SAID A PRECONDITION THAT HE'S GOT TO ABANDON HIS PLAN TO IMPOSE THIS CONTRACT
NO WE HAVEN'T REFUSED TO TALK WE CONTINUALLY REQUESTED TALKS AND IN FACT HE WON'T GO IN EMMA YOU WERE LADY GOING ON CERTAIN TERMS I'VE BEEN WITHOUT IF YOU GO DOWN TO RICHMOND HOUSE TODAY YOU'LL FIND A GROUP OF JUNIOR DOCTOR SITTING OUTSIDE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO CALL OFF THE STRIKE BY ENDING THE IMPOSITION BUT YOU WILL ONLY GO IN ON CERTAIN TERMS NICK WE HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY AND ALWAYS THAT WE WILL CALL OFF THE STRIKE IF THE GOVERNMENT WILL CALL OFF THE IMPOSITION I'M SORRY GOT TO BANKS WAS A VERY VERY SIMPLE CRIKEY CONTRA OH YOU SETTING A PRECONDITION FOR TALKS
WITHOUT YOU MAY THINK IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE PRECONDITION BUT ARE YOU SETTING ONE NO I'M NOT SETTING A PRE PRECONDITION YOU WOULD GO IN NOW
SO WHAT WHAT I'M SAYING IS WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IF HIS GOVERNMENT WILL CALL OFF THE POSITION SO BE CERTAIN TURTON'S YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE END IF THE GOVERNMENT WILL CALL OFF THE IMPOSITION WE WILL CALL OFF THE STRIKES BY CONTRAST THE GOVERNMENT TO SAID OVER THE WEEKEND THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT WILL GET IT CALL OFF THE IMPOSITION
WHERE MIGHT WE END UP NEXT WE SAW SOME LEAKED EMAILS TO THE HEALTH SERVICE JOURNAL LAST WEEK IT SAID THAT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS' B.M.A. COMMITTEE ARE CONTEMPLATING A PERMANENT WALK OUT THE MASS RESIGNATION OF TRAINEES AND RECOMMENDING YES RECOMMENDING DOCTORS SEEK JOBS OUTSIDE THE N.H.S. OR CAREERS OUTSIDE MEANT THEY ALL POSSIBLE
THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION AMONGST AMONGST YOU NEED DOCTORS ABOUT WHAT STEPS MIGHT BE TAKEN IF THE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO RESPOND TO THE INDUSTRIAL ACTION AND THEY'RE ALL POSSIBLE AT DECISIONS HAVE YET BEEN TAKEN THERE ALL POSSIBLE WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE ALL POSSIBLE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE ALL YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO HAPPEN

THEY INSIST THEIR MOVE WOULD NOT AMOUNT TO SIMPLY RE BRANDING LOCAL AUTHORITIES SINCE IT WOULD ONLY BE OPEN TO SUCCESSFUL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL SCHOOLS WOULD STILL HAVE TO BE WILLING TO OPT IN

HAS THREATENED TO ESCALATE FIGHTING ACROSS TURKEY UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT AGREES TO NEGOTIATIONS PEACE TALKS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES BROKE DOWN LAST YEAR OUR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT IAN PANEL SPOKE EXCLUSIVELY TO JIMMY'LL BY IC AT HIS MOUNTAIN HIDEOUT IN NORTHERN IRAQ
ONE SIDE IN THIS BATTLE OF THE MILITANTS LED BY THE CURD ESTAN WORKERS PARTY OR P.K.K. THEY SAY THEY'RE A SELF DEFENCE COURSE FIGHTING FOR KURDISH RIGHTS AND SELF RULE
BUT ANKARA SAYS IT'S A TERRORIST GROUP THAT SLAUGHTERS SOLDIERS POLICE AND CIVILIANS
THE TURKISH PRESIDENT HAS VOWED TO FORCE THE MILITANTS TO SURRENDER OR BE ANNIHILATED BUT NOW THE MAN WHO LEADS THE P.K.K. HAS RESPONDED
I MEANT JIMMY'LL BY ERIC IN THE CANDLE MOUNTAINS OF NORTHERN IRAQ I'VE GOT ONE I'VE GOT IS ESCALATED THOUGHT HE WAS THE CURSED TO UNDER
IF THEY DON'T KILL ALL CUTS SO OF COURSE THE PAIR ESCALATE THE WAR THAT ONLY IN THE KURDISH AREAS BUT THE CROSS TURKEY
IF TURKEY HAVE SUP GENOCIDE OF POLITICS AT CHOOSERS NEGOTIATIONS WE ARE READY THE PRESIDENT HEARD A WINE OF TURKEY HAS RULED OUT TALKS ACCUSING THE P.K.K. OF WANTING TO CREATE A BREAKAWAY STATE
THE RHETORIC AND THREATS ON BOTH SIDES SUGGEST LITTLE CHANCE THAT PEACE TALKS WILL RESUME SOON INSTEAD EXPECT MORE BLOODSHED AND VIOLENCE IN TURKEY THIS SUMMER
DONALD TRUMP'S RIVALS FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION HAVE ANNOUNCED A DEAL TO AVOID CAMPAIGNING AGAINST EACH OTHER IN FORTHCOMING STATE PRIMARIES TED CRUISERS CAMPAIGN SAID IT WOULD FOCUS ITS ATTENTION ON INDIANA ALLOWING JOHN CASE LIKE A CLEARER SHOT AT WINNING OREGON OR NEW MEXICO THE AGREEMENT IS AIMED AT PREVENTING MISTER TRUMP SECURING ENOUGH DELEGATES TO WIN THE NOMINATION
THE AMERICAN SOUL SINGER BILLY POWELL HAS DIED FROM CANCER AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY HE WAS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO HIT ME AND MISSUS JONES WHICH WON A GRAMMY AWARD AND REACHED NUMBER ONE IN THE U.S. CHARTS
FIFTH LISTED LISTER'S MAJESTY THIS IS JOE
MUSIC OF BILLY PAUL WHO'S DIED
THE TIME IS NOW TEN PAST EIGHT THIS IS THE WEEK THE FIGHTBACK BEGINS THE REFERENDUM FIGHT BACK THAT IS OF COURSE LAST WEEK WAS PRETTY ROCKY FOR THOSE CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA EFFECTIVELY TELLING US WE'D BE BARMY TO LEAVE AND SLAPPING DOWN BORIS JOHNSON FOR WHAT SOME SAID WITH HIT HIS RACIST REMARKS AND GEORGE OSBORNE COATING TREASURY FIGURES
TELLING US HOW MUCH POORER WE'D BE IF WE LEAVE SO ARE THEY RATTLED WELL I'M JOINED BY THE ONLY CABINET MINISTER ACTUALLY TO HAVE RESIGNED FROM THE CABINET SINCE IT BEGAN BUT HE IS A LEADING VOICE FOR THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AND HE IS OF COURSE IAIN DUNCAN SMITH GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING RATTLED
NO NOT REALLY THIS IS A LONG CAMPAIGN HE'S GOING TO BE PRETTY ROBUST ON BOTH SIDES I SENSE I MEAN THE REALITY IS THAT BEFORE THE PURDAH BEGINS AND FOR THE PUBLIC REALLY THAT'S THE MOMENT WHEN ALL GOVERNMENT ACTION HAD PAID FOR ACTION HAS TO STOP AND THEN THE TWO CAMPAIGNS REMAIN AND LEAVE THEN FIGHT OUT ON A THICK SUM OF MONEY
UP UNTIL THAT POINT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT MY GUM THAT I WAS A MEMBER OF IS ABLE TO USE ALL ITS RESOURCES ALL ITS POWERS CIVIL SERVANTS AND SPENT TAXPAYERS' MONEY TO DO THAT LIKE SO YOU'VE HAD FOR EXAMPLE THE POINT FOR THE WILL COST NINE MILLION POUNDS IT WAS VERY ONE SIDED ABOUT REMAINING YOU THEN HAVE THE TREASURY PRODIGIOUS DOCUMENT TOGETHER BEGINNING OF LAST WEEK WHICH
MOST RATIONAL ECONOMIST OF QUESTION BECAUSE IT ABSOLUTELY WELL THEY HAVE THE INSTANT FISCAL STUDIES WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE TREASURY PUT OUT LIKE THE BEGINNING OF LAST WEEK WHAT YOU FIND IS THEY HAVE TAKEN ABSOLUTELY THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOMES AND ANYTHING FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE EVENT FORECAST FIFTEEN YEARS AHEAD NOW I HAVE TO TELL YOU HAVING SAINT GOVERNMENT IN THIS IS NOSE TRADE SECRET MOST GOVERNMENT STRUGGLE TO BUILD A FORECAST SIX MONTHS AHEAD I MEAN LAST YEAR'S FOR EXAMPLE THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GO THAT WERE THEY AS THE INSTANT PHYSICAL STUDY SAID THEY DIDN'T
TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE WAY HE WAS DESCRIBED BY GEORGE OSBORNE I WILL GIVE YOU THAT THEY'RE NOT THERE WERE HOWEVER THEY DID SAY IT WAS PRETTY MUCH BROUGHT BUT WE WOULD BE AT THEY WERE QUITE CLEAR ABOUT THIS WE WOULD BE WORSE OFF IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION
WELL THE WOULD FALL WELL THAT IS ALL SPECULATIVE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE YOU'VE GOT A POLICE SOMEBODY ON THE SORT OF THOSE NOW I HAVE TO TELL YOU ONE THING I HAVE LEARNT SINCE BEING IN GOVERNMENT JOHN IS ONLY THAN EVERY SINGLE FORECAST IS PROBABLY WRONG SO I'LL SHOW YOU NOW WELL YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE ANY FORECAST REALLY THAT'S MY POINT ABOUT IT AND I'M NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF FORECASTING ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT IF YOU GO FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WHEN YOU LOOKED AT WHEN WE DID THE AUTUMN STATEMENT THAN THERE WAS FORECAST TO BE A TWENTY SEVEN BILLION POUND TAX
WINDFALL THAT WAS GOING TO COME IN THE KEY YEARS ON SPENDING AND WITHIN A MONTH AND A HALF WERE TOLD IT WASN'T THERE SO I'M NOT MAKING ANY CRITICISM AND SIMPLY MAKE THE OBSERVATION I THINK THE ONLY ARMY THIS OBSERVATION IN THE END ALL FORECASTS ARE PROBABLY WRONG ALL RIGHT WHILE THEY'RE DOWN TO THE REALITY AND THEN WE HAVE THE REALITY NOW THAT'S A GOOD WORD ISN'T IT BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT YOUR LOT HAVE BEEN SAYING ISN'T NOT REALITY HITS FICTION WHAT DID YOUR CRITICS I DON'T THINK SO I THINK EVERYONE'S GOING TO SAY EACH OTHER'S TELLING A LOAD OF LIES
THAT'S THE NATURE OF POLITICAL DEBATE YOU'VE BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH TO TRY AND ASK THOSE PEOPLE TO TELL THE TRUTH AND WE ALL BELIEVE THAT WE ARE TELLING THE TRUTH THE ONLY THING I THINK YOU NEED TO DO IS GET IT DOWN TO SOME VERY SIMPLE POINTS WHICH IS FIRST OF ALL IN THE FIESTA IN THE SUNDAY TIMES AND I MADE THE POINT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S PREMISED ON THE REASONS WHY HE WOULD VOTE TO STAY ON THE BASIS OF HER HE WOULD GO AWAY AND GET A FULL REFORM EUROPEAN UNION WHICH INCLUDED A WHOLE LIST OF QUITE IMPORTANT FEATURES INCLUDING
CONTROLS ARE BORDERS IT ALSO INCLUDED IN ALL SORTS OF AREAS LIKE THE ISSUE AROUND THEIR WHATEVER THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT NOW I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE POINTS SO FIRST OF ALL DID WE GET THAT REFORM BECAUSE IF WE GOT THE REFORM AND THE PUBLIC BELIEVES THAT WHAT EUROPEAN UNION IS NOW SO REFORMED THAT WE CAN STAY IN IT THEN THEY'LL VOTE TO STAY MY BELIEF IS WE DIDN'T GET THE REFORM WELL AND I THEREFORE BELIEVE THE LOGICAL POSITION IS TO LEAVE THE SECOND THAT IS WELL HANG ON BEFORE YOU LEAVE THAT IT WAS ONE WHICH I WANT TO MAKE IT WHAT I KNOW BUT BUT IT'S ON THAT SPECIFIC POINT
IF WE DIDN'T GET THE REFORMERS ARE PUBLIC WILL VOTE TO LEAVE YEAH PROBABLY NOT IF THE PUBLIC WILL LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED DURING THEIR LIFETIMES AND BASED ON THAT THEY WILL DECIDE WHETHER DEVOTE OR LEAVE SURE WELL ACTUALLY ALL THE POLES I SAW BEFORE SAID THAT THE PUBLIC IS CATEGORIC THAT THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE IT'S HEADING
WHAT BENEFITS IN FUTURE IT WILL BRING ALL DIS BENEFITS IT WILL BRING TO THEM RIGHT THAT'S A COURSE THE CRITICAL ARGH YOU ALL RIGHT ALLY QUESTION THERE IS THEREFORE AND BY THE WAY THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THE PRIME MINISTER MY EX COLLEAGUES ALL AGREED THAT THAT WAS THE POSITION IN OTHER WORDS THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE BLOOMBERG SPEECH WAS NOT WORKING IT NEEDS FULL REFORM HE LAID OUT DEVOLVE EMPLOYMENT CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS LIMITED POWERS OF THE UNIVERSE OF THE EUROPEAN AND YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE O.K. OH MUCH FURTHER STRUCTURAL FUN CHANGES
YOU KNOW FULL TREATY CHANGE AND BORDER CONTROL THOSE ARE THE THINGS HE LAID OUT AND ALL I'M SAYING WHEN YOU EXAMINED THAT AS THE TEMPLATE FOR REFORM YOU ARE THEN LEFT WITH THE INESCAPABLE CONCLUSION WHICH BY THE WAY THERE THE PUBLIC ALSO AGREED WAS THAT WE DID NOT ACHIEVE A REFORM OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN WHICH CASE THEN THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE VOTING TO LEAVE RIGHT BUT THEY'VE ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL RIGHT THEY KNOW EUROPEAN I'M NOT THAT FOLLOW THAT RUB IT DOWN WITH THE HOLE WITH A CERTAIN EXTENT THEY LOVE EUROPEAN THEY WOULD STAY IN IT
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE CONSEQUENT LEATHER LET LET LET'S INSTEAD PERHAPS LOOK AT SOME OF THE CLAIMS YOU'VE BEEN MAKING AND WE ARE TOLD THAT IMMIGRATION IS THE BIG ONE TODAY REX IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN CONTROL IMMIGRATION WILL THAT SIMPLY ISN'T TRUE IS IT HOME SECRETARY SAID SO YESTERDAY NO SHE DIDN'T DID SHE SAID JOHN IF YOU REMEMBER SHE WAS QUITE CLEAR SHE SAID THE FREEDOM MOVEMENT
POSES SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS TO HAVE CONTROL OF MIGRATION THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING O.K. IT'S ONE HUNDRED TIMES TELL YOU LOVE THINGS LIKE IT POSES SIGNIFICANT WRONG WHAT THEY MEAN IS IT'S OUT OF CONTROL WE'VE GOT SO MANY PEOPLE COMING IN HERE YOU SAW THAT AFTER WE HAD THE ENTRY OF THE OF THE LAST EUROPEAN DOESN'T THAT HAS ALL WE HAD OVER A MILLION PEOPLE COME THROUGH IN A MATTER OF YEARS THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS ACCEPTED THERE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY WE BOTH KNOW THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT BUT THIS IS THE POINT THE END OF OF
NO
AT THE END THE FREE MOVEMENT IN OTHER WORDS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN A BIG DROP AN AUTOMATIC DROP IN IMMIGRATION THIS IS ACCORDING TO MIGRATION WATCH NEVER GOES WELL YOU'D ACCEPT THAT MIGRATION WATCH'S REPUTABLE AUTHORITY ON THIS WOULDN'T YOU YES BUT OF COURSE THE KEY ELEMENT HERE IS AN ELECTED GOVERNMENT IN THE U.K. ELECTED ON A PLATFORM TO REDUCE IMMIGRATION RIGHT NOW CANNOT DELIVER THAT BECAUSE THE E.U. IS AN OPEN BORDER YOU CANNOT REJECT ANYBODY UNLESS YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE AS THE HOME SECRETARY POINTED OUT YES THEY CATEGORICALLY THAT THEY POSED AN IMMEDIATE THREAT
TO THE VERY LIFE AND LIVELIHOOD OF THE U.K. THE REALITY IS THEREFORE WE HAVE TO ACCEPT PEOPLE EVEN CRIMINALS MY GOD YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF CASES OF PEOPLE HAVE GOT CRIMINAL RECORDS THEN COME OVER HERE THEN ACTUALLY COMMIT CRIMES WE CAN'T EVEN GET RID OF THEM WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
A COURT OF JUSTICE AND MY DONORS WHO ARE NOT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE TO CONFORM TO ALL THE U.K.'S BORDER AND IN THE HORSES THERE EXACTLY THERE SO YOU'RE NOT IN THE EUROPEAN KNOW WHAT WONDERFUL WORDS THOSE ARE THOSE NOT IN THE EUROPEAN LET'S EXAMINE THAT FOR A SECOND THOSE NOT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE THOSE WHO ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HERE'S THE POINT ABOUT IMMIGRATION WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT
WE WOULD HAVE A POLICY TO HAVE CONTROLLED MIGRATION IT'S NOT AN END OF MIGRATION IT'S ABOUT CONTROLLING WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS YOU WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN HERE WHERE THERE ARE NEEDS FOR THEM SOFTWARE ENGINEERS ENGINEERS GENERALLY SKILLS THAT ARE REQUIRED I WAS THEIR WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY AND I CAN TELL YOU NOW WHAT INSTEAD HAPPENS IS AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE COME IN HERE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ACTUALLY COMPETE HUGELY WITH LOTS OF BRITISH PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE JOB CENTRE
TRYING TO DO JOBS THAT BASICALLY THEY CAN DO LOW SKILLED NON SKILLED JOBS AND THEY DROP DOWN THE SALARY LEVELS THEY DAMAGE THE POOREST PEOPLE IN SOCIETY BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN THEIR INCOMES FALL EVEN SKILLED WORKERS LIKE CARPENTER ALL RIGHT AND PLUMBERS FIND THEY COULDN'T GET JOBS ON THE OLYMPIC PARK BECAUSE THEY WERE OUTBID BY PEOPLE COMING MORE BUOYANT BOW DAMAGING POORER PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT THIS AMOUNTS TO NORWAY AND SWITZERLAND HAVE GOT HIGHER IMMIGRATION PER HEAD OF POPULATION FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION
THIS COUNTRY DOES I MEAN SO WHERE IS A POINT HERE WHAT IS THE POINT YOU MAKE A POINT WILL DRASTICALLY TO THE ARCHES NO THE POINT IS THE DEAL THAT THEY DO AND THIS IS THE VIEW THAT YOU DO AND LET ME POINT IS IF YOU WANT TO DEAL AND IF THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE ALSO BY THE WAY I'M NOT A GREAT BELIEVER IN SAYING LOOK AT THE NORWAY LOOK AT SWITZERLAND BECAUSE WE ARE A VERY VERY GOOD LOT OF THOSE WORKERS WERE A VERY DEAF ALL RIGHT LOOK LET'S THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD JOHN WE HAVE THE FOURTH LARGEST DEFENCE CAPABILITY
WE ARE ALREADY A GLOBAL PLAYER THE ANSWER IS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION AT THE END OF THE DAY HAS TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT KIND OF A DEAL IT WANTS TO DO WITH US BUT I STILL BELIEVE
WHEN WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BRITISH PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THE POROUS WILL BENEFIT ENORMOUSLY THE PRESSURE ON SCHOOLS THE PRESSURE ON HOSPITALS OPPRESSION ON HOUSING ALL RIGHT CAUSED IN MANY AREAS BY NUMBERS ARE MIGRANTS COMING IN FROM THE E.U. IS ENORMOUS WAS IT'S NOT AN ANTI MIGRANTS UPON US IT'S ABOUT GETTING BALANCE WAS ALL THINGS TALKING ABOUT BALANCE WAS BORIS JOHNSON RIGHT TO ATTACK OBAMA IN THE WAY THAT HE DID
WAS THAT SENSIBLE TACTICS QUITE APART FROM THE GOOD TASTE OR WHETHER IT WAS A RACIST REMARK OR WHATEVER BUT WAS IT SENSIBLE TO DO WHAT HE DID TO GO FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY TO YOU IS YOU KNOW ME LONG ENOUGH THAT I THINK THAT THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN DEMEANS POLITICS THAN WHEN ANOTHER POLITICIAN JUMPS UP AND DOWN AND IN LOSING THE ANY KIND OF ARGUMENT WANTS TO HURL A KIND OF A NAME LIKE RACIST THAT PEOPLE I FIND THAT ABSURD IT WAS MAURICE JOHNSON'S RIOT TO SAY WHAT HE SAID I THINK HE'S CORRECT IN THIS REGARD AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAID
WHAT HE SAID WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS COMING OVER HEART KENYAN PRESIDENT HE SIMPLY REFERRED TO ONE OF THEM SOME OF THE REASONS WHY HE MAY HAVE A PARTICULAR LACK OF REGARD FOR THE U.K. CAN SEE THE RACIST DOG WHISTLE WELL I KNOW I KNOW YOU AND I ASK THIS GUY'S NOT HAVE NOT GOT BREAD AMERICAN LOOK YOU CAN TALK TO BORIS YOURSELF I KNOW BUT WE CAN'T BECAUSE HE WON'T COME ON THE PROWL I HAVE TO TELL YOU I KNOW BORIS VERY WELL AND IN IN IN NO WAY CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM AS THAT
HE HAS FOUGHT AGAINST THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN AS I HAVE ANY KIND OF RAZOR WHY DID HE SAY WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE I THINK AND YOU MAY SAY IT WAS COMES A BIT IT WAS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE REALITY THAT HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
THAT THIS PRESIDENT CAME OVER TO THE U.K. AND INNOCENCE I WAS QUITE SURPRISED ACTUALLY ENDED UP WHAT APPEARED TO BE LECTURING THE UNITED KINGDOM BRITISH CITIZENS AS TO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IN THE FORTHCOMING REFERENDUM THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN IT'S AMONGST THIS LOT INSIGHTFUL THE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE YOUR MILLION THERE DONE I ACTUALLY HAVE HUGE REGARD FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO SPOT A KINDA COSY CONSENSUS GOING ON HERE BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT THAT WANTS US TO VOTE TO REMAIN IN
AND AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY WANTS TO GET A TRADE DEAL AS HIS LEG RIGHT SO YOUR FLOORS WITH BORIS JOHNSON I WANT I WILL HE SAID AND THE WAY IN WHICH HE SAID IT LOOK EVERYBODY HAS TO DECIDE THE WAY THEY SAY THINGS ASKING YOU WHETHER YOU WOULD I AM FOUR SQUARE WITH WHAT HE IS ACTUALLY SAYING INSOFAR AS THIS AND THAT'S RIGHT WHAT HE SAID WHICH IS THAT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT IS ACTUALLY ONLY SEEKING WHAT HE WANTS FOR HIS OWN COUNTRY I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR THAT WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS THE BRITISH PEOPLE RECOGNISE I MUST RECOGNISE
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE E.U. AND THE CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS AND THE RISKS THAT REMAINING IN THE E.U. POSED TO US IT IS THE BRITISH PEOPLE THAT WILL PICK UP THE PIECES FOR THIS NOT SO WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAYS BRITAIN WOULD BE AT THE BACK OF THE QUEUE IN THE NEW TRADE TO GO SEE ASIANS IT'S JUST WRONG YOU SEE HE DOESN'T KNOW I HAVE NO IDEA ALL I KNOW IN THIS YOU SHOULD HAVE SHOULDN'T ENDING WHAT BORIS JOY IT GOING ON A SECOND LET'S VERY CAREFULLY EXAMINE THAT STATEMENT THE FIRST IS I'VE NEVER HEARD AN AMERICAN USED THE WORD
ALL RIGHT WE KNOW THAT IT WAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WE HAD A LITTLE COSY CONVERSATION WITH LENNY ME I'LL DEAL WITH WILL YOU PLEASE JUST GO OUT AND JUST MEANT WHAT'S THE POINT A BIT THAT THERE IS A VALUE HERE AND YOU'LL BE AT THE BACK OF IT O.K. NOT THAT ONE LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT POINT YOU ARE THE NEXT MOTHER WAS WHETHER HE'S RIGHT OR NOT BANKING RIGHT O.K. LET'S DEAL WITH THAT ONE THE REALITY IS THAT THE QUEUE SO FAR AT THE MOMENT EXISTS
ONE TREATED NEGOTIATION AND THAT'S THE EUROPEAN OR TEA TIP HORRIBLY NAMED IMPORTANT O.K. THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE BY THE WAY SOMEWHERE BECAUSE TWENTY SEVEN COUNTRIES CAN'T AGREE AND THE U. S. A. WANTS THINGS AND I ACTUALLY TRICKY TO NEGOTIATE I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD WELL TWENTY SEVEN COUNTRIES AS A NIGHTMARE THERE YOU GO JOB IF YOU GO
LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WON'T LET ME JUST REMIND YOU THAT TWENTY SEVEN COUNTRIES IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A NIGHTMARE NEGOTIATE WITH THE GERMANS DON'T REALLY WANT THE TREATY I THINK THE TREATY ITSELF BIT OF A NIGHT SO SWEET FOR US IN ALL OF OUR RE RE NEGOTIATE AS IT'S CALLED DEALING WITH ONE COUNTRY AUSTRALIA HALF THE POPULATION OF OURS DID THE TREATY NEGOTIATION IN TWO YEARS THE OTHERS WHERE IT'S TAKEN SEVEN YEARS OF AGE THROW ALL OF THEIR SINGLE COUNTRY NEGOTIATIONS WHERE THEY REALLY MATTER THE U.S.A. KNOWS THEY CAN DO IT I WAS IN WASHINGTON YOU DON'T KNOW NO WELL NO WAS HE BY THE WAY AND I WON'T WATCH DO YOU ACCEPT IT ON THERE THAT'S FINE EXCEPT THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW I WAS IN WASHINGTON WAIT HIM OUT WAS NO NO NO I DON'T KNOW I'LL TELL YOU WHY I SAY THAT BECAUSE I WAS IN WASHINGTON LAST WEEK TO MAKE A SPEECH ABOUT WELFARE REFORM
AND I GOT TALKING TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM CAPITOL HILL CONGRESSMAN ET-CETERA AND
ALMOST ALL OF THEM SAID TO ME THEY THEMSELVES DID NOT LIKE THE DEAL AND THEY WERE NOT ALL RIGHT LET IT GENTLY SO THE IDEA AGE YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE SHOULDN'T IT RE NEGOTIATE ALL THE AGREE MEL THIS IS NOT A MAJOR POINT JOHN WHO'S THE PRIDE PRESIDENT PRESENT THAT TAKES FIVE OR TEN YEARS IT'S A TAKES AS LONG AS BOTH SIDES WANT TO BE OLDER MORE BUSINESS PEOPLE LISTENING TO YOU SAYING I'VE GOT THESE DEALS I KNOW I CAN SELL THIS STUFF TO THIS COUNTRY AND SO ON AND SO ON BECAUSE
GOT ALL THESE DEALS IN PLACE OF THE EUROPEAN YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD HAVE MATT NO HANG ON A SECOND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE A TRADE DEAL EUROPE DOESN'T HAVE A TRADE DEAL THE BRITISH BALANCE OF PAYMENTS WITH THE U. S. A. IS ABOUT EQUAL ABOUT THAT HANG ON NO NO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT YOU'RE GOING IS A BALANCED ALL RIGHT IN THE U.S. IN HERE WHAT'S NOT BALANCE IS A TRADE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE WE RUN A MASSIVE DEFICIT WITH COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY AND FRANCE WHO SELL THEIR CARS IN HERE AND BILL THEIR CHEESES AND ALL THEIR FOODS NOW WE ARE A VERY OPEN MARKET
THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW MANY OF THOSE MARKETS THEMSELVES TO FINANCIAL SERVICES ARE NOT OPEN AS THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE SO WE HAVE SUFFERED AS A RESULT BY BEING A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION POINT ABOUT TRADE DEALS JOHN IS THERE ABOUT THE WILLINGNESS OF TWO GOVERNMENTS TO AGREE SOMETHING WE AS BRITAIN A FREE TRADING NATION SIX PER CENT OF AMERICA'S OVERSEAS TRADE A DRAMATIC PROPORTION THE SECOND LARGEST INVESTOR IN THE UNITED STATES AFTER JAPAN AHEAD OF CHINA MYRRH TELLING ME THAT THEY WON'T WANT TO DO A DEAL WITH THAT
ALL THE POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON I TOLD ME LAST WEEK THEY WANTED TO DO WITH US AND THEY DON'T AGREE WITH MY I'M AFRAID I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY COS WE RUN OUT OF TOUCH YOU DON'T THINK OF YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU WANT TO CHECK THE REALITY AS IT WERE IT NOT THAT I'M SUGGESTING THAT BUT WITH WHAT WE'VE JUST BEEN HERE AND IT WAS NOT THE REALITY BUT THAT'S FOR YOU TO DECIDE BECAUSE THE B. B. C. HAS ITS Y. U. REFERENDUM REALITY CHECK AND YOU
GET THAT ON A WEBSITE AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AS WELL AS THAT IF YOU KILLED THIS PROBLEM OF COURSE YOU ARE TWENTY FIVE PAST EIGHT NOW THIS WAS A MOMENT OF REALITY RATHER DIFFERENT THE MOMENT YOU MIGHT HAVE DRIPPED OFF IF YOU'RE THE UNDERSTUDY TO A TOP HOLLYWOOD STAR IN A BIG WEST END SHOW AND THEY'RE TAKEN ILL AS YOU PREPARE FOR YOUR BIG BREAK YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND OF THE AUDIENCE AND BOOING HOW WAS THE EXPERIENCE OF RIA JONES

FLAGSHIP OXFORD STREET STORE AND YOU CAN GET AS MUCH AS THEY WANT LATER CERTAINLY DIDN'T KNOW THEY WANTED TO GET SEVENTY MILLION FOR THAT THEY ONLY GOT FIFTY MILLION THEY WANTED TO SELL ANOTHER BUNCH OF STALLS OF THIRTY MILLION AND HE GOT TWO MILLION FOR THAT ALONE THEY HOPE TO AGREE CAME UP SHORT WHEN IT TURNED OUT THEY WERE MASSES ARE UPFRONT CROSS COSTS SO ALL IN ALL THEY'VE THEY'VE FALLEN SHORT IN THERE IS ANGER WHEN I SPOKE TO THE BITCH A BITCH A SPOKESPERSON TODAY
REAL ANGER THAT THE NEW OWNERS RETAIL ACQUISITIONS HE'S RATHER SHADOWY GROUP ALL NOT WELL KNOWN GROUP OF FINANCIERS AND LAWYERS PROMISED TO PUT IT ALL THIS MONEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN FACT THEY'VE TAKEN OVER EIGHT MILLION POUNDS
OUT OF THE BUSINESS IN THE EARLY DAYS AFTER THEY BOUGHT IT FROM PHILIP GREEN FOR A POUND SO THEY'RE SAYING WHY DID THEY WHAT WALK OFF WITH THE MONEY AND NOT SUPPLY THE MONEY THEY DO IT WAS A PHILIP GREEN HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY NO HE SOLD IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO FOR ONE POUND TO THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE NOW HE HE MAY HAVE TO THERE'S A FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUND PENSION DEFICIT WHICH WILL NOW DISAPPEAR INTO THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND WHICH IS GOVERNMENT SPONSORED LIFEBOAT SCHEME HE MAY BE ON THE HOOK COS THEIR PENSIONS REGULATOR CAN GO TO
PREVIOUS OWNERS AND SAY YOU OWE US A BIT BECAUSE YOU OWN IT SO RECENTLY HE'S THOUGHT TO HAVE OFFERED EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS THAT PENSIONS REGULATE IT MAY WANT A LOT MORE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE TERRORISM ILLEGAL MIGRATION ARMS SMUGGLING ALL REASONS MINISTERS TELL US WHY THEY SHOULD NOT RULE OUT SENDING TROOPS TO LIBYA
AS WELL AS ORDERING AIR STRIKES AND NAVAL PATROLS THEY SAY THEY'LL ONLY DO IT OF COURSE IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM THE FLEDGLING UNITY GOVERNMENT IN LIBYA THE SUBJECT OF HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM THERE WILL BE HIGH ON THE AGENDA AT TODAY'S MEETING OF THE G. FIVE THAT'S THE LEADERS OF THE UNITED STATES U.K. GERMANY FRANCE AND CRUCIALLY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE ITALY WERE JOINED ON THE LINE FROM OXFORD BY OLIVER MILES THE FORMER BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO LIBYA AND FROM CAVERSHAM FROM THE B.B.C.'S MONITORING UNIT BY MOHAMMED AL A SAR MORNING TO YOU BOTH
MOHAMMED FIRST OF ALL HAVE A GOOD YOU ARE PAID TO MONITOR SOCIAL MEDIA LIBYAN RADIO AND SO ON AND SO FORTH WHAT SORT OF SUPPORT DO YOU DETECT FOR THIS NEW FLEDGLING GOVERNMENT
I THINK MOST LIBYANS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR DESIRE FOR THE CHAOS TO STOP OR EVER STOPS THAT THEY'RE PREPARED TO SUPPORT BUT ANYBODY WHO COULD BRING BACK BASIC SERVICES WHO COULD MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ELECTRICITY AND THAT THERE ARE NO TERRORIST ATTACKS AND WHO
WHO COULD FACE ISIS WHICH HAS THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IS TAKING OVER THE CENTRAL LIBYAN PART A LOT OF OIL AREAS ARE THREATENED BY ITS EXPANSION SO THEY WANT TO SEE THAT
BUT IF THE LEADERS IT WHO WERE MEETING IN HANOVER TODAY IF THEY EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS GOVERNMENT IS THAT HELPING IT OR ACTUALLY HINDERING HE'S IN GETTING SUPPORT FROM THE PEOPLE IN THE B.
IT'S HELPING WITH REGIONAL BACKERS IT'S HELPING GET WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT IN PUBLIC OPINION IT'S ALSO A BIG WEAKNESS OF THAT GOVERNMENT A LOT OF OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES AROUND THAT AND A LOT OF CRITICS JUST SAY IT'S WESTERN BACK TO NOT TRUST THEM SEE WHAT NATO THAT WHEN THEY INVADED
THANK YOU FOR THAT JUST HOLD ON FOR A SECOND IF YOU WOULD I'M GOING TO BRING IN OLIVER MILES NOW THE FORMER BRITISH AND BASTER TO LIBYA IS A DILEMMA ISN'T IT OLIVER MILES AS TO WHETHER THE WESTERN POWERS SHOULD NOW RUSH IN TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO SUPPORT THIS GOVERNMENT OR IF BY DOING SO THEY ACTUALLY UNDERMINE IT WITH THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY MATTER
EXACTLY THAT'S REALLY THE POINT AND SO FROM THE PURELY THE POINT TO BE OVER LIBYA LIBYA WATCHER LIKE ME IT DOESN'T PARTICULARLY GOOD NEWS BUT THIS IS VERY VERY HIGH PROFILE NOW ON A SUMMIT MEETING IN BERLIN BERLIN WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE OTHER LEADERS AND SO ON
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO TODAY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A GOVERNMENT TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MILITARY INTERVENTION CONTROL EVEN IF IT'S TO SAY NOT YET WILL NOT INFLUENCE THE DEBATE IN LIBYA IN A GOOD DIRECTION
IN OTHER WORDS THAT GOVERNMENT RISKS THAT FLEDGLING GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN CALLING RISK BEING SEEN AS A PUPPET OF THE WEST YES SOME PEOPLE DO THINK IT'S A POCKET THERE'S NO DOUBT HOW MEANT HOW MANY THEY ARE OR HOW INFLUENTIAL THEY ARE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO JUDGE BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SOME PEOPLE SHIT THAT WAY AND YET SOME OF A SCAR I CAN WE AFFORD TO WAITERS I AIR SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE BUILDS ITS POWER IN LIBYA THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS NOT JUST FOR LIBYA BUT FOR US AS A RESULT OF IT WELL DONE SIR IN TERRORISM ENCOURAGING MIGRANTS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY CAN WE RISK WAITING
WE DON'T NEED TO EXAGGERATE THAT YOU SAY GROWING MATTER OF FACT I ISIS HAVE UPHELD NOW SOLIDLY FROM ONE PARTICULAR TOWN SORT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST BETWEEN TRIPOLI AND BAKE HALFWAY BETWEEN TRIPOLI AND BENGHAZI THEY'RE MAINLY I BELIEVE NON LIBYANS SOME FOREIGN ARABS
NON ARABS THEY'RE NOT POPULAR IN LIBYA THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF BENGHAZI THEY'VE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS ANOTHER TIME WITH A VERY LONG HISTORY OF STROLL ISLAMISM
AS FOR THE PROBLEM OF MIGRANTS DON'T FORGET THAT THIS IS NOT ESSENTIALLY A LIBYAN PROBLEM THERE'S A PROBLEM OF A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING OUT OF AFRICA AND OTHER OTHER PARTS AFGHANISTAN ERITREA SHONE FOR THE COME THROUGH THEY COME THROUGH LIBYA AND THEN THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR HER FOR MANY YEARS AND IT WILL REMAIN A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE FACT IS THAT LIVIA HAS A HUGE COASTLINE AND IT'S NOT VERY FAR FROM EUROPE IS THE FOREIGN SECRETARY RIGHT
TO DO AS HE DID AT THE WEEKEND AND SAY WE'RE NOT RULING ANYTHING OUT INCLUDING TROOPS ON THE GROUND ALTHOUGH HE'S EMPHASISING THIS WOULDN'T BE COMBAT TROOPS THEY WOULD BE TROOPS TRAINING LIBYAN FORCES OR DO YOU THINK HE EVEN THAT IS TO MAKE AN ERROR AND TO RISK REPEATING HISTORY
WELL I THINK IF I'D BEEN ADVISING AND THE FOREIGN OFFICE I WOULD HAVE SAID DON'T RULE ANYTHING OUT BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO SAY SHOW
IT WAS QUITE HARD IF YOU'RE ASKED ISN'T IT IT IS QUITE HARD IF YOU ARE SHALL I APPRECIATE THAT MINISTERS HAVE TO SAY THAT WE ARE DOING SOMETHING IT'S NOT NOT GOOD ENOUGH SIMPLY TO SAY WAIT EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT BE THE MOST DESIRABLE THING BUT IT'S NOT ALL BAD NEWS THE
SO CALLED GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL RECORD WHICH WAS THE ONE THAT WE ARE HOPING WILL WILL WILL SUCCEED IN ESTABLISHING ITSELF AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MAKING PROGRESS OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS SINCE IT RETURNED TO LIBYA THEY'VE THEY'VE NOW TAKEN OVER A NUMBER OF MINISTRIES THAT THE BIG STICKING POINT IS THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN TO BROOK
WHICH WAS REFUSED REPEATEDLY TO MEET AND TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THEM BUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MEMBERS HAVE COME UP WITH A STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL ACCORD DON'T DESPAIR THERE IS MOVEMENT IN LIBYA AND MOTION OF IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO NOT FRUSTRATED OLIVER MILES I SAID YOU ARE FORMER BRITISH BEST OF COURSE YOU ARE BUT YOU'RE CURRENTLY THE EDITOR OF THE ARAB DIGEST NEWSLETTER AS WELL A MUHAMMAD AL ELEAZAR FROM B.B.C. MONITORING THANK YOU
IT'S A QUARTER TO NINE WE HEARD EARLIER ON THIS PROGRAMME FROM THE KURDISH MILITANT GROUP THE P.K.K. THEIR LEADER TALK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT IAN PANEL FROM THEIR BASE IN NORTHERN IRAQ AND VOWED TO ESCALATE THE CONFLICT ACROSS TURKEY AS LONG AS PRESIDENT EVERYONE CONTINUES WHAT THEY CALL GENOCIDAL POLITICS WERE A CORRESPONDENT IN TURKEY MARK LOWE AND HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT TO THE PRESIDENT'S SENIOR ADVISOR HE'LL NO TRAFFIC AND MARK IS ON THE LINE NOW MARK WHAT WHAT DID HE HAVE TO SAY IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS
OR JOHN THE PHRASE READ TIE BAD ONE HAS USED IN THE PAST IS WE WILL ANNIHILATE THE P.K.K. AND HIS GOVERNMENT IS VERY MUCH STICKING TO THAT LINE AROUND A THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE CONFLICT REARED UP AGAIN LAST SUMMER THAT'S INCLUDING TURKISH SOLDIERS AND POLICE P.K.K. FIGHTERS AND CIVILIANS AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR RECRUITING AND RADICALISING THE NEXT GENERATION OF P.K.K. FIGHTERS BY CONTINUING THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN SOUTH EAST TURKEY BYE
ALIENATING A WHOLE SECTION OF THE TURKISH POPULATION BUT WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM A CHEVY MUST ADD ONCE CHIEF ADVISOR HE REJECTED THAT ACCUSATION AND SAID THE GOVERNMENT WOULD PURSUE ITS OPERATIONS TO FLUSH OUT WHAT TURKEY THE E. U. AND THE U.S. CALL A TERRORIST ORGANISATION
THE CHICK IS PEOPLE NOW REALISE THAT THE P.K.K. NEVER WANTED RICO NATION THEM LIVING TOGETHER
THEY WANT A SEPARATE STATE PEOPLE CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY LIKE WHAT THEY ARE DOING AT THE MOMENT IS TRYING TO CREATE A SEPARATE STATE IT JAKEY
THIS IS OUTRIGHT SECESSION SO WHAT
WE ARE DOING NOW IS WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THAT
WE ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE RIGHT TILL THE BITTER END TO STOP THIS
THE TURKISH PEOPLE ARE NOW DETERMINED I CAN SEE THERE
IN ALL THE PUBLIC OPINION POLLS AS WELL THEY SAY DON'T STOP
SO NO RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS TURKEY REMAINS RESOLUTE IN POUNDING THE P.K.K. THERE'S A WEARY SENSE OF DIJON BOO HERE BECAUSE THE SO CALLED KURDISH PROBLEM HAS EXISTED PRETTY MUCH SINCE THE TURKISH REPUBLIC WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN TWENTY THREE ATATURK'S NATIONALISM AND A PROCESS OF TURKEY FICATION SUPPRESS THE IDENTITY OF THE KURTZ THE LARGEST MINORITY
TURKEY'S PRESIDENT IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES KENAN EVER EM ONCE FAMOUSLY SAID THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS KURDS THEY'RE SIMPLY MOUNTAIN TURKS AND KURDS WILL BE ARRESTED FOR STATING THEIR ETHNIC IDENTITY AND PUBLIC ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN THE P.K.K. AND THE TURKISH STATE FROM THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES ONWARDS KILLED FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT DID CHANGE WITH RICHARD HAD WON HIS GOVERNMENT FROM TWO THOUSAND THREE BROUGHT IN REFORMS FOR EXAMPLE ALLOWING KURDISH NEWSPAPERS AND A T.V. CHANNEL THE KURDISH LANGUAGE WAS ALLOWED TO BE TAUGHT IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS
THE CEASEFIRE WITH THE P.K.K. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BODED WELL AND A PRO KURDISH POLITICAL PARTY EIGHT D. P. MADE IT INTO PARLIAMENT LAST YEAR FINALLY GIVEN THE KURDS ARE POLITICAL VOICE ON THE NATIONAL STAGE BUT I PUT IT TO A CHAIR VIC THAT SINCE VIOLENCE RETURNED THINGS ARE NOW AS BAD AS AT THE HEIGHT OF THE INSURGENCY IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND MY BAD ONES KURDISH OPENING HAD FAILED THE POLICY ITSELF IS NOT A THADIUS
IF YOUR DAD SUCCEEDED IF THE P.K.K. MEANT WEALTH THIS BEAST RESIST WOULD'VE BEEN VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL
BUT THEY WERE IN THE INTENDED THEM THEY JUST TOOK US FOR A RIDE
THEY TOOK ED LOVER RIGHT DONE IT'S A HUMAN BEINGS LIKE US EH HE HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE DOUBLE CROSSED LIKE THIS
NEVER A HUMAN BEING JOHN YES BUT A CALCULATING POLITICIAN TO AND MY AD ONCE CRITICS SAY HE CHOSE TO END THE CEASEFIRE WAS TO SHORE UP HIS NATIONALIST SUPPORT BASE SOMETHING HE VEHEMENTLY DENY
EITHER WAY THE KURDISH UNREST IS BAD NOW WITH TWO SUICIDE BOMBS IN ANKARA SINCE FEBRUARY BLAMED ON THE KURDISH MILITANTS KILLING ALMOST SEVENTY PEOPLE WESTERN GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING BRITAIN HAVE CALLED FOR BOTH SIDES TO RETURN TO PEACE TALKS BUT THERE'S LITTLE PROSPECT OF THAT AS THIS VITAL NATO MEMBER AND Y. YOU HOPEFUL SPIRALS FURTHER INTO CHAOS MARK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARK LOWE AND PAINTER
IT'S ELEVEN MINUTES TO NINE BILLY PAUL THE PHILADELPHIA SOUL SINGER HAS DIED OF CANCER AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS MANAGER I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO A FRIEND FREDA PAYNE WHO SANG THE NINETEEN SEVENTY HIT BAND OF GOLD AND TOWARD EXTENSIVELY WOULD BILLY PAUL WHEN HE ALWAYS PLAYED THAT SONG
AND WE SAY THAT
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE EVEN AT HIS AGE AND NOW I HAVE TO I'LL BE HERE
I'LL BE HERE KEEP STILL IT WAS A GOOD BOY
THE THAMES THE VIBRANT THEY FOUND
OUR CONVICTION AND HAD BOY
LET'S SEE THIRTY FIVE FORTY YEARS
LISTEN ARTHUR THIS IS JOEL DID YOU WHAT WAS IT ABOUT HIS VOICE
HE PRESUMES IT WHEN HE DOESN'T WE ABOUT HIS BOY
WITH SOMETHING
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY HE WOULD THINK BOY
IF YOU KNOW YOU WON'T BUT IT WASN'T LIKE HE WAS THE GREATEST SINGER OF THE WORLD BUT HE WAS
YOU KNOW WHAT HE REALLY WAS THE JAZZ SINGER HE WAS A JAZZ SINGER EDDIE JUST FEEL HOW TO CAPTURE
SYNCHRONICITY THAT'S A PUP FEELING IF YOU HEARD HIS VOICE BUT YOU IF THEY ARE BETTER
IT'S SOMETHING THAT OTHERS DIDN'T YOU KNEW HIM AS A MAN SO I GET A LAST WORD ON BILLY PAUL THE MAN DOING PLANT A MAN
HE WOULD TELL IT LIKE IT IS YOUR COLOUR ETHER AID THAN A FADED THEY BUT HE WAS A GOOD
I'M GOING TO MISS THEM TERRIBLY
HEY THEY'RE REMEMBERING THE LATE GREAT BILLY PAUL
IT IS NOW NINE MINUTES TO NINE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE HAVE NO RIGHT TO ADEQUATE HELP ENGLAND EVEN IF THEY ARE SLEEPING ROUGH THAT IS THE CLAIM FROM A GROUP OF CHARITIES HOUSING ORGANISATIONS AND LAWYERS THEY SAY THAT AS THE HOMELESSNESS FIGURES GET WORSE THE LAW IN ENGLAND MUST BE CHANGED SO THAT IT'S MORE LIKE THE SYSTEM IN WALES WHERE COUNCILS HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE FACING HOMELESSNESS EARLIER AS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS REPORTS
LUNCH TIME AT THE IN HOSTEL IN MERTHYR TIN THE COOKS TODAY RESIDENTS MATTHEW AND
BOTH HOMELESS BOTH QUITE RECENTLY AT THEIR LOWEST EBB MATTHEW AFTER THE BREAK UP OF A RELATIONSHIP BUT IF SHE WAS AWFUL I DID GET THOUGHTS ABOUT KILLING MYSELF
IN THE END THEN JUST THE STICK THROUGH IT LEG IT'S NOT LIKE THIS JUST A FUNERAL WITH NOTHING
NOWHERE TO GO ON NO NOTHING IN YOUR POCKETS AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE VERY TYPE WAS JUST PROBABLY DONE TO MY LOWEST POINT WITH THAT I'D NEVER BEEN BEFORE
AFTER THE WAY HE USED TO WANT TO LEAVE LIVE TOGETHER JUST GO DOCTOR WOBURN ISN'T IT
JUST ONE DAY
IT CAN IT DOES GET BETTER IN THE KITCHEN THEY'RE BOTH HAPPIER THAN THEY WERE
I GOT SOME WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STAY AT ABOUT THE PESTO ANYONE I WAS JUST LOOK TOO THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE BRICKS AND MORTAR THIS IS ABOUT YOURSELF
IT KIND OF BROUGHT MY SELF RESPECT BACK YEAH THE PLACE WHEN I WAS WHEN I LEFT IT WAS A JOKE
WRECKED ME HOW TO PICK UP THE PIECES IN WALES THINGS HAVE CHANGED COUNCILS NOW HAVE A DUTY TO HELP STOP PEOPLE BECOMING HOMELESS AND THEY HAVE TO ACT ALMOST TWO MONTHS BEFORE SOMEONE RISKS
ACTUALLY LOSING THEIR HOME THE STAFF HERE SAY THAT'S MADE IT EASIER TO PREVENT THE WORST FROM HAPPENING AND KYLE ONE OF THE WORKERS HAS SEEN HOW BAD THINGS CAN GET TO GO TO THE MOUNTAINS COS WE GOT
THE COVER OF THE TREES ON ONE OCCASION I DID SIGNED BY IN THE CAVE A QUARRY BUT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT WAS HAPPENING IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY U.K. AT THE MOMENT
AND NOW ELSEWHERE IN THE U.K. REPRESENTATIVES FROM CHARITIES AND HOUSING GROUPS ARE INSISTING THAT THE ENGLISH SYSTEM SHOULD BE MORE LIKE THE WELSH
BECAUSE IN ENGLAND COUNCILS DON'T HAVE TO ACT UNTIL JUST UNDER A MONTH BEFORE SOMEONE EXPECTS TO THESE THEIR HOME AND THEY ONLY HAVE A DUTY TO ACTUALLY RE HOUSED PEOPLE JUDGED TO BE HIM PRIORITY NEED A MOST HEALTHY ADULTS WITHOUT CHILDREN
OUR PRIORITIES EVEN ENTHUSIASTS FOR THE WELSH SYSTEM THOUGH LIKE DAVE JONES FROM THE CHARITY THAT RUNS THIS HOSTEL ADMIT IT'S FAR FROM PERFECT
SOME PEOPLE PRESENT AND GOES WITH THE PROCESS AND THEY AND THEY DO THE HOUSING PLAN AND AND THAT'S FINE OTHERS I KIND OF TOLD OR IT'S LIKE YOU WOULD A CHANCE ON IT THERE ISN'T MUCH AVAILABLE FOR EWAN AND BASICALLY TURNED AWAY
AND WOULD SIMPLY DEMANDING ENGLISH COUNCILS DO MORE REALLY HELP THE LABOUR MAYOR OF THE LONDON BOROUGH OF KNEW HIM SIR ROBIN WALES LIKES THE IDEA BUT SAYS IT WOULD NEED MORE CASH AND MORE HOMES TO WORK
IF YOU SEE SOMEBODY YOU HAVE TO HOSE THEM I HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE TO HOSE THEM I CAN'T MAGIC THINGS UP WE CAN BUILD THEM GIVEN A FEW YEARS WE COULD BUILD THEM BUT IN THE MEANTIME IT MEANS USING EXISTING ACCOMMODATION WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE GOVERNMENT WILL SUBSIDISE SO AT THAT POINT YOU ARE A DIFFICULT POSITION
IN SCOTLAND COUNCIL'S ALREADY HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE WHETHER THEIR PRIORITIES OR NOT AND CHANGE COULD BE COMING TO WESTMINSTER A GOVERNMENT SOURCE TELLS ME THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THESE IDEAS THEY'VE ALREADY MADE CLEAR THEY MAY CHANGE THE LAW BUT MINISTERS COUNCILS
AND THOSE LEFT HOMELESS OR KNOW THAT WITHOUT ENOUGH TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT HOMES FOR THEM REWRITING THE RULES ALONE WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM
