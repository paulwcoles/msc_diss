WEATHER CENTRE CHILE ONE TOM OH YES I WAS SHIVERING THIS MORNING THAT'S FOR SURE SONNY HAD TO SCRAPE MY CAR WINDOW MANY OF US WILL HAVE TO IF YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO WORK VERY VERY FROSTY OUT THERE TEMPERATURES WIDELY BELOW FREEZING EVEN IN TOWN CENTRES AND WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF SNOW TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING AS WELL
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN AFFECTING PLACES ANYWHERE FROM NORTHERN SCOTLAND THROUGH THE BORDERS DOWN THAT NORTH SEA COAST INTO LINCOLNSHIRE AND EAST ANGLIA AND ACTUALLY THROUGH TODAY THIS IS WHERE WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE SOME ON AND OFF FLURRIES OF SNOW OR OCCASIONALLY A BIT OF WET SLEET AS WILL AND RAIN FROM TIME TO TIME AS WELL IT GOES HAND IN HAND
TEMPERATURES TODAY REALLY WILL STRUGGLE OF COURSE AFTER A COLD MORNING THERE CLEAR NIGHTS WILL LEAD TO A CLEAR DAY AND NO WARMER THAN AROUND FOUR DEGREES I THINK FOR MOST OF US ARE PARTICULARLY CHILLY ALONG THE NORTH SEA COAST BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE A STRONG WIND BLOWING OUT OF THE NORTH AND IT WILL FEEL RAW FOR EXAMPLE ON THE NORTH COAST OF NORFOLK READY VERY COLD TODAY
THAT TAKES US INTO TONIGHT AND IN FACT IT IS GOING TO BE EVEN COLDER WE'RE EXPECTING THE COLDEST NIGHT OF THE WINTER SO FAR SO THAT MEANS THAT TOMORROW MORNING WILL BE THE COLDEST MORNING OF THE WINTER SO FAR WE'RE EXPECTING TEMPERATURES WIDELY IN RURAL SPOTS TO BE DOWN TO MINUS SEVEN DEGREES CELSIUS AND THAT'S IN THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY SO A VERY CHILLY IN TOWN CENTRES AS WELL
AND THE WEATHER TOMORROW SHOULD BE BRIGHT SUNNY AND CHRIS FEWER OF THOSE WINTRY SHOWERS IN THE EAST BUT A CHANGE IS ON THE WAY TOMORROW LATER IN THE DAY WE ARE EXPECTING SOME RAIN INTO WESTERN SCOTLAND WITH INCREASING WINDS AND THAT HERALDS A SLIGHTLY MULDER CHANGE LATER ON IN THE WEEK BUT
THANKS VERY MUCH THOMAS IT'S COMING UP TO EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS LOTS OF DIFFERENT LEADS THIS MORNING AT THE INDEPENDENCE IS ABOUT PLANS BY THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP PUBLICLY FUNDED INSTITUTIONS THINGS THAT LOCAL COUNCILS PUBLIC BODIES EVEN SOME UNIVERSITY STUDENT UNIONS ARE GOING TO BE BANNED BY LAW FROM BOYCOTTING
UNETHICAL COMPANIES IT'S A CRACKDOWN ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT IT MEANS THAT THEY THEY'LL LOSE THEIR FREEDOM TO REFUSED TO BUY ANYTHING FROM COMPANIES WHO MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THE ARMS TRADE IN FOSSIL FUELS TOBACCO OR ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS IN THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK THE IDEA IS THAT THAT THIS NEW LAW WITH IT IS BECAUSE BOYCOTT UNDERMINED GOOD COMMUNITY RELATIONS POISONED POLARISED BAIT AND FUEL ANTI SEPARATISM
BUT CRITICS SAY IT'S A GROSS ATTACK ON DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS AND THEY MAKE THE POINT THAT THE BAN CERTAINLY THIS IS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN SAYS THE GOVERNMENT'S BAN WOULD HAVE OUTLAWED COUNCIL ACTION AGAINST APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA
THE MALE LEADS WITH A STORY ABOUT THE N.H.S. IS OUT OF HOURS HOTLINE THE ONE ELEVEN SERVE US AND ON ITS FRONT PAGE IT HAS PICTURES OF TWO MEN THE OPERATORS ANSWERING CALLS FOR THAT SERVICE WITH THEIR HEADSETS ON SOUND ASLEEP AND THE MALES HAS AS THESE ARE THE EXCUSE ME THE DEVASTATING IMAGES THAT SHAME THE N.H.S. OUT OF HOURS SERVICE TAKEN OF THE COUNTRY'S WORST PERFORMING ONE OF URBAN CENTRE THEY SHOW AN EXHAUSTED PARAMEDIC
AND CALL HANDLER FAST ASLEEP AT THEIR POSTS UNABLE TO HEAR POTENTIALLY LIFE OR DEATH CALLS COMING IN FROM PATIENCE BUT
MOST DISTURBING IS A PIECE WRITTEN BY SARAH HAYES WHO WAS HERSELF A FORMER SENIOR CALLED ADVISER AND SHE WRITES THIS I'LL NEVER FORGET A NIGHT I WAS LEFT ON MY OWN WITH NO NURSE OR PARAMEDIC IN OR ONE OF THEM CALL CENTRE COVERING THE WHOLE OF DORSET I HAVE NO MEDICAL TRAINING BUT I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARE OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH NO SUPPORT I CALLED THE MOST SENIOR MANAGER ON DUTY WAS ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY IN DEVON AND TOLD THEM I HAD NO MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL TO TURN TO HE SAID YOU'LL BE FINE JUST CARRY ON
THE TELEGRAPHS LEAD IS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE BACK BRECK'S IT OF COURSE THERE'S A PRIME MINISTER GOING TO BRUSSELS THIS WEEK TO THRASH OUT THEIR FINAL DEAL ON BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP AND THIS PAPER SAYS THAT JEREMY RIGHT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HE'S CONSIDERING JOINING THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN
LEAVE THE E.U. IT'S OVER FEARS THAT EUROPEAN COURTS ARE ERODING BRITAIN'S SOVEREIGNTY IN THAT THE DEAL DAVID CAMERON FINALLY STRIKES MAY NOT GO FAR ENOUGH AND IT MAKES THE POINT THAT HIS PARTICULAR POSITION IS PARTICULAR INTRIGUING BECAUSE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL HE HAS A KEY ROLE IN DECIDING WHETHER ANY DEAL IS LEGALLY BINDING AND HE HASN'T COMMENTED ON THEIR STORY BUT A SAW SAID IF HE DOESN'T THINK IT'S A GOOD ENOUGH DEAL HE'LL VOTE TO ME
AND THE TELEGRAPH HAS A BIT ON ITS FRONT PAGE ABOUT OF THESE PEOPLE BEING LESS INCLINED TO EXERCISE BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAPPED IN AN ALTERED REALITY THAT MAKES DISTANCES APPEAR LONGER SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND THEIR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THE WORLD ACTUALLY APPEARS MORE DAUNTING TO FAT OF PEOPLE IN THE SAME WAY AS A HILL MIGHT SEEM HIGHER TO SOMEONE WEARING A HEAVY BACKPACK
IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX IT WAS THE BAFTAS LAST NIGHT IN THE BIG WINNER OF THE NIGHT WAS THE WILDERNESS DRAMA THE RESONANT IT TOOK AWAY FIVE AWARDS INCLUDING BEST FILM BEST DIRECTOR AND THE FOURTH TIME OF ASKING BEST ACTOR FOR LEONARDO TO CAPPIE

MEANWHILE OUTSTANDING BRITISH FILM WENT TO THE PERIOD DRAMA BROOKLYN ABOUT A YOUNG IRISH WOMAN WHO EMIGRATED TO NEW YORK AND IT WAS DIRECTED BY JOHN CROWLEY
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HONOURING I FILMED IN THIS WAY BUT AFTER ONE OF THE THINGS THIS FILM'S ABOUT IS THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS AND
AS THE FILM'S MADE ITS WAY OUT INTO THE WILDS THE WALK TO THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN COMPLETELY OVERWHELMING
WHATEVER A TINY BIT OF THIS I CAN LAY CLAIM TO I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH FIONA WE'RE NOT ONLY THRASHED US WITH THAT
SHE'S GOT TO PUT UP WITH ME EVERY DAY SO HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY
AND WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE BRITISH SCREENWRITER OF BRIDGE OF SPIES AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX NOW INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEGUN IN SWEDEN INTO WHY THE CAR CARRYING THE BRITISH BAND VIAL OF BEACH CRASHED INTO A ROAD BARRIER KILLED ALL FOUR OF THEM AND A HOLIDAY IN AS A REPORTER IN THE SORT OF TELL YOU ANNA ANY IDEAS YET WHAT HAPPENED HERE
I'M STANDING ON A SNOWY JUST UNDERNEATH THIS BRIDGE IS EIGHTY FEET HIGH THE TRAFFIC'S ALL MOVIE AGAIN THIS MORNING THOSE BARRIERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY AS PART OF THEIR POLICE INVESTIGATION
AT THIS BAND FOUR BAND MEMBERS OF RISING STARS ON THE BRITISH MUSIC SCENE AND THEIR MANAGER HAD ALL JUST FINISH THEIR FIRST FOREIGN GIG IT WAS A FEW HOURS LATER THEY WERE HEADING BACK TOWARDS THE AIRPORT
AND SOMETHING WENT WRONG CLEARLY ON THIS BRIDGE THE BRIDGE THE MIDDLE SECTION RAISES UP SO THE BARRIERS HAVE GONE DOWN THE RED LIGHTS WERE FLASHING
OTHER CARS WERE WAITING BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY'RE THEIR HIRE CAR CONTINUED MOVING AND IT CRASHED DOWN UNDERNEATH THIS BRIDGE HAD JUST SPOKEN TO POLICE THIS MORNING AND
TOLD US THEY HAVE FOUR LINES OF ENQUIRY SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT FIRST OF ALL THE CONDITIONS THAT NIGHT IT WAS TWO THIRTY LOCAL TIME TWO THIRTY A.M. WAS THAT SLIPPERY ON THE ROADS IT WAS CERTAINLY BELOW FREEZING AS IT IS NOW
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS ON THE BRIDGE SO OTHER WITNESSES HAVE SAID THAT THE BARRIERS WERE DOWN AND THE LIGHTS ARE FLASHING
ONE OF THEIR LINES OF INQUIRY THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE CAR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW OVER THE WEEKEND THE PICTURES OF
CASH CHI IS IT WAS RECOVERED FROM THIS CANAL
YOU COULD TELL BY LOOKING AT THIS VEHICLE THE IMPACT OF THE CRASH THAT'S BEEN TAKEN AWAY NOW FOR A TECHNICAL EXAMINATION THE POLICE SAY AND THERE ARE ALSO CARRYING AUTOPSIES ON THE FORWARD WERE BAND MEMBERS AND THEIR MANAGER WHO WERE ON BOARD DO WE KNOW WHO WAS DRIVING
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WAS DRIVING WE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THE POLICE ARE LOOKING INTO NO WE KNOW FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPENT THE NIGHT WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THERE A DRESSING
SO I'M AFRAID WE HAVE LOST OUT THERE BUT I THINK WE HAVE THE GIST OF WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY YOU CAN HE STILL HEAR ME ANNA THANKS SO MUCH
QUARTER PAST SIX TIME FOR THE BUSINESS NEWS AND TANYA IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BANKS THIS MORNING LOTS OF STORIES ABOUT BANKS WELL YES FIRST OF ALL EUROPE'S LARGEST BANK H.S.B.C. HAS DECIDED IT'S SAID TO KEEP THEIR HEADQUARTERS IN THE U.K. THIS OF COURSE DESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASED REGULATION AND THE RISK OF THE BRACTS IT MEANWHILE OF COURSE AS WE KNOW INVESTOR WORRIES HAVE LED TO A SLIDING EUROPEAN BANK SHARES THEY LOST ABOUT A FIFTH OF THEIR VALUE ALONE THIS YEAR
AMID ALL THIS TURMOIL THE MAN WHO LED THE INQUIRY INTO THE SAFETY OF U.K. BANKS JOHN VICKERS SIR JOHN VICKERS SAYS HIS PROPOSALS ARE NOW BEING WATERED DOWN BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND I'M JOINED BY ERIC NORLAND WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ECONOMIST OF C.M.E. GROUP WELCOME TO YOU AND CHRIS WHEELER FROM ATLANTIC EQUITIES HE'S A BANKS ANALYSTS THERE SO CHRIS GOOD IDEA TO START WITH YOU ON H.S.B.C. WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT WOULD HAVE FED INTO THAT DECISION TO STAY IN LONDON
YES GOOD MORNING I THINK THE KEY ONE OBVIOUSLY IS THAT LONDON IS AN INTERNATIONAL CENTRE RECOGNISED PROBABLY THE MOST RECOGNISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CENTRE AND I THINK THAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THEM ALSO I THINK IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE LOCATION IT'S TOUGHER BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A VIEW THAT HAVING STRONG LIKE A NATION STRONG LEGAL FLAME WORK ALL THESE THINGS ARE QUITE IMPORTANT FOR VERY LARGE BANK OPERATING ACROSS MULCH THIS MULTIPLE DUDGEON STICKS
IN TERMS OF THE SLIDE IN BANKING SHARES WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S CONTRIBUTED TO DAD IT'S INTERESTING WHAT'S SIR JOHN VICKERS HAS HAD TO SAY ABOUT HIS CONCERNS ABOUT CAPITAL IS THAT REPLICATED BY INVESTORS I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE I FOCUS ON U.S. BANKS WERE HAVE WOULD BE MUCH MORE STRONGLY CAPITALISED MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN THEIR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS I THINK THERE'S OTHER THINGS AFFECTING THEIR DECLINE ENERGY PRICES INTO THE SLATES IN THE UNITED STATES IF WE LOOK AT EUROPE I THINK IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
WHILE THE U.K. I THINK HE'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE I THINK THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE SO CALLED LES TESTING HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT ON THE BANKS AND WHETHER THEIR BALANCE SHEETS ARE PARTICULARLY PERHAPS THE POLITICAL BANKS ARE STRONG ENOUGH AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THOSE PROBLEMS PLUS WE HAVE A COUPLE OF THOSE BIG BANKS CUT ITS RECENT DEUTSCHE BANK GOING THROUGH MASSIVELY SLUT SHILLINGS WHICH ARE WOWING PEOPLE BECAUSE THE TIMING ISN'T PERFECT
LET'S COME BACK TO BANKS' BALANCE SHEETS IN A MOMENT ERIC DO YOU THINK THAT THE THE INSTABILITY THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE MARKETS AND A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT SORT OF MACRO ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IS FEEDING IN TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH BANKS AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEY ARE THERE
THE LINK BETWEEN BANKING SHARES AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IT'S VERY CLOSE ISN'T IT YES IT IS ABSOLUTELY HAD TO WAIT CHRIS I THINK THE BANKING SECTOR'S VERY CONCERNED OR INVESTORS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT EXPOSURES PARTICULARLY THICK ENERGY ENERGY PRICES ARE DOWN SEVENTY PERCENT BY THE MEASURES A BRANCH OR WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE CRUDE
AND THAT'S HAVING A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE BALANCE SHEETS OF ENERGY COMPANIES AND I THINK INVESTORS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BANKS THAT HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPOSURE IN THAT CARRIER THAT SAID THE BRA A MACRO ECONOMY CONTINUES TO APPARENTLY FUNCTION FAIRLY WELL HE'LL LOWER ENERGY PRICES ARE ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS FOR CONSUMERS AND SO I THINK THAT IT COULD KEEP THE ECONOMY GROWING IN THE BANKING SYSTEM QUITE STABLE OVERALL
BUT A FIFTH THIS YEAR AS A DROP IN STALKS IS REALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT YOU CAN'T IGNORE THAT KENNY
NO YOU CAN'T BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS COMES AFTER A VERY VERY LONG BULL MARKET U.S. STARKS ARE UP ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PERCENT ART OF THEIR TWO THOUSAND NINE LOWERS THE FOOTSIE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED FROM ITS LOWER BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE IN MUCH OF THAT RALLY OCCURRED WITHOUT VERY MANY CORRECTIONS OCCURRING SO WE FINALLY HAD A MARKET CORRECTION IT'S A FAIRLY NORMAL PROCESS FROM MARKETS TO GO THROUGH
CHRIS COMING BACK TO BANKS' BALANCE SHEETS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT SO CALLED COCO BONDS AND SO ON AND WHAT SIR JOHN VICKERS AND THESE ARE BUNS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE TURNED INTO EQUITY OF TIME TO GET HARD SO IT WOULD STABILISE HER BANKS' BALANCE SHEET IF THAT WAS THE CASE AT THE QUESTION IS AT WHAT POINT DO YOU CONVERT THEM AND WHAT SIGNAL DOES THAT SEND TO THE MARKETS BUT IT'S AN INEXACT SCIENCE ISN'T IT TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH BACK HOW MUCH CAPITAL A BANK NEEDS BECAUSE THIS IS A MATTER OF CONFIDENCE
WELL IT IS BUT OF COURSE THE FEELING IS THAT THE SO CALLED WAS QUOTED ASSETS WHICH IS THE WAY YOU YOU SORT OF ADJUST YOUR TOTAL ASSETS FOR WHAT THERE WAS THE INHERENT WHISKIES IN THEM OUGHT TO BE WHAT ACTUALLY MANAGES WHAT THE WHISKIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND HOW MUCH CAPITAL YOU SHOULD HAVE ABOUT AGAINST THAT IS WHAT KIND OF BUFFER YOU WANT WE MUST REMEMBER SIR JOHN'S COMPLAINING BECAUSE HE'S SAYING THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND LOOKING TOWARDS ELEVEN PERCENT
WHAT WE CALL COMMON EQUITY TIER ONE LES SHOW I SHOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE BANK OF SCOTLAND BEFORE THE CRISIS IT WAS PROBABLY ON SOMETHING BETWEEN TWO AND THREE SO WE HAVE MADE ENORMOUS SLIDES AND YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THAT THAT BUFFER ACTS CAPITAL STRENGTH WITH THE ABILITY FOR THE BANKS TO LEND TO THE NEAR THE WIDER ECONOMY MORE CAPITAL YOU PUT ON THEM THEN THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM TO LEND SO I THINK THAT'S LILY IT'S A IT'S A AS YOU SUCH IS AN ISSUE
CHRIS WHEELER AND HER WRITTEN ALL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE MARKETS WE'VE MENTIONED THEM ALREADY THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING OF A RE BOUND FOR THE U.S. AND EUROPEAN STOCKS RISING ON FRIDAY THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET IS UP VERY STRONGLY IN FACT DESPITE CHINESE TRADE NUMBERS FOR JANUARY SHOWING EXPORTS FALLING ELEVEN PERCENT IMPORTS DROPPING OVER EIGHTEEN PERCENT AND FOR THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET WE'VE HAD FIGURES SHOWING THAT THE ECONOMY CONTRACTED AT AN ANNUALISED RATE OF ONE POINT FOUR PER CENT
IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF LAST YEAR SO WHAT PICTURE IS EMERGING MICK HUNGERFORD IS C. O. A NUTMEG INVESTMENT NICK VOLATILITY OBVIOUSLY BUT WHAT ELSE
OTHERS SO MANY THEMES RUNNING AROUND AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE INVESTORS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE KEEPING VERY COOL AND MAKE SURE THEY STAY INVESTED STAY DIVERSIFIED DON'T PUT ALL THEIR EGGS IN ONE BASKET AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE CONTROLLING WHAT THEY CAN CONTROL THE FOREMOST OF WHICH OF COURSE IS THE COST OF INVESTING BUT I JUST WANT TO BRING BRING US BACK TO WHAT ERIC SAID THERE ABOUT JAPAN
AND CHINA THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS DESPERATELY TRYING TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THEIR MARKET THIS WEEKEND THEY'VE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR CURRENCY BECAUSE SPECULATORS SUCH AS HEDGE FUNDS AND CURRENCY TRADERS ARE TRYING TO WEAKEN THE CHINESE CURRENCY WHICH OF COURSE HAS A KNOCK ON EFFECT THROUGHOUT CHINA AND THROUGHOUT ASIA
THIS MORNING WE'VE SEEN JAPAN UP EIGHT PER CENT IN THE MARKETS IT'S AN INCREDIBLE TIME FOR PEOPLE TO BE TO BE INVESTING TO SEE THESE RAPID CHANGES WHY DID WE SEE THIS REBOUND BECAUSE THE PICTURE HASN'T CHANGED IT DOESN'T CHANGE IN THE COURSE OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT DIDN'T AND IN FACT AS AS YOU SAID IN YOUR INTRODUCTION THERE WAS SOME BAD ECONOMIC NEWS JOB THIS MORNING WITH WITH JUDY P. ANNUALISED I DON'T FALLING RATE OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT
BUT PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTION YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ON THIS PROGRAMME ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER'S ABBA NON MIX THE PROMISED ABI ABOUT HOW HE IS INTERFERING WITH MARKETS AND WHAT HE'S DOING AND NOW INVESTORS ARE EXPECTING MORE ACTION TO COME
AND THE NEWS ECONOMICALLY IS NOT ALL THAT BAD CONSUMER SPENDING CONTINUES TO INCREASE EMPLOYMENT CONTINUES TO INFORM THAT TO FOOL SO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY FUNDAMENTALLY THAT BAD IN JAPAN BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS GOING ON
AND OBVIOUSLY CHINA WHAT HAPPENS IN EUROPE WE'RE LET'S TURN OUR THOUGHTS TO THE OLD PRICE THERE IS A DE THOUGHTS NOW THAT OPEC ACTUALLY MIGHT BE COMING ROUND TO TALKING ABOUT CUTTING
PRODUCTION OF HER HAVING HELD OUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME WHAT EFFECT DO YOU THINK THIS WOULD HAVE BECAUSE PARADOXICALLY AS WE WERE HEARING FROM ERIC YOU KNOW A LOWER OIL PRICE YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR MANY ECONOMIES INDEED IT IS BUT THE MARKETS HAVE INTERPRETED IT VERY VERY BADLY
THEY HAVE AND ON FRIDAY WON'T THIS THIS THIS RUMOUR ABOUT THE CUT AND THE PLAQUE SUPPLIED CAME OUT OIL PRICES WERE UP OVER TEN PER CENT ANOTHER GIANT MOVE SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN IT MEANS PRETTY LITTLE ACTUALLY TEN PER CENT FOR A VERY LOW BASE IS NOT MUCH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OIL PRICES AROUND THIRTY DOLLARS A BARREL GOING UP TO THIRTY THREE IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHERE THEY'VE COME FROM WHICH WAS ABOUT SEVENTY DOLLARS THERE WE MUST LEAVE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK THE
P. PERHAPS WHAT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS THAT A BAD SHORT TERM INVESTMENT JUST BECOMES A LONG TERM IN THAT'S RIGHT BUT I COULD BE A STOCKBROKER BUSINESS GROUPS ARE LOBBYING THE GOVERNMENT IN THE RUN UP TO THE BUDGET THE SOCIAL MARKET FOUNDATION AND A DECO HAVE ISSUED RESEARCH INTO THE IMPACT OF THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WHICH FINDS THAT BUSINESSES COULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BOOSTING WORKER PRODUCTIVITY OR CUTTING COST TO DEAL WITH THE NEW RATE FROM APRIL THE FIRST JUST TO REMIND YOU WORKERS OVER TWENTY FIVE
WHO EARNED THE MINIMUM RATE OF SIX POUNDS SEVENTY AN HOUR WILL RECEIVE A FIFTY P. INCREASE ON THE LIVING WAGE IN THE GOVERNMENT'S COMMITTED TO INCREASING THIS TO NINE POUNDS BY TWENTY TWENTY AND RUN ME AND WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE SOCIAL MARKET FOUNDATION IS WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO THIS LOOKS LIKE BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO HOW THEY GET VALUE FOR MONEY IF THEY'RE PAYING WORKERS MORE QUITE SIMPLY
THAT'S RIGHT AND THE SCALE OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE COMING IN ON THE FIRST OF APRIL IS WORSE THINKING ABOUT AGAIN WE ESTIMATE THAT OVER THREE MILLION WORKERS WERE GOING TO SEE A PAY RISE ON THE FIRST OF APRIL SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG CHANGE FOR LOTS AND LOTS OF WORKPLACES AND WE ALSO LOOKED AT WHICH WORKPLACES WILL BE MOST AFFECTED AND THE THRESHOLD THAT WE USED TO HIS WE LOOKED TO WORKPLACES WERE OVER FIFTY PER CENT OF THEIR EMPLOYEES WERE GOING TO SEE A PAY RISE ON THE FIRST OF APRIL
AND WHEN YOU USE THAT THRESHOLD EVERY HOTEL AND RESTAURANT WORKPLACE IN THE U.K. IS GOING TO BE SEVERELY AFFECTED ABOUT HALF OF RETAIL WORKPLACES WERE GOING TO BE SEVERELY AFFECTED RIGHT SIT IN THESE JOBS IS IT POSSIBLE TO FOR A COMPANY TO SAY RIGHT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO UPSCALE IN TERMS OF SKILLS AND WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE OUT OF THESE WORKERS ALWAYS THAT NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS
SO A LOT OF THE WORKERS WHO ARE GOING TO BE SEEING A PAIR EYES HAVE NO QUALIFICATIONS WERE HAVE KESEY QUALIFICATIONS THOSE TWO GROUPS MAKE UP ABOUT HALF OF THE WORKERS WERE GOING TO BE AFFECTED SO THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE IS SOME ROOM FOR TRAINING HERE BUT EQUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORK PLACES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE AFFECTED MOST OF THEM DON'T PROVIDE ANY TRAINING AT ALL AT THE MOMENT THE ONES THAT DO PROVIDE TRAINING PROVIDE IT TELL ME A SMALL PROPORTION OF THEIR STAFF
WHICH SUGGESTS THAT PERHAPS THE SCALE FOR HOW MUCH TRAINING WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO PRODUCTIVITY IN THESE PLACES ISN'T THAT GREAT AND I THINK THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION FOR US SO IF YOU'RE A RETAILER THAT HAS LARGE NUMBERS OF STAFF ON LOW PAY DO YOU THINK THE TRAINING ALL THE TYRE PULLING TO REALLY OR IN FACT WERE YOU MOVED MORE QUICKLY TOWARDS AUTOMATION AND MORE SELF SERVE WHERE THERE IS SO MUCH TALK ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY AT THE MOMENT IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN PRODUCTIVITY FOR SOME YEARS IN ACTUAL FACT
WHAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MIGHT DO TO IT TO CHANGE THAT IS THE CONCERN IN MANY CASES AND OBVIOUSLY HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS WOULD NOT BE GOOD EXAMPLES OF THIS WHERE SOME COMPANIES MIGHT SAY O.K. WE WILL NOW TRY TO TO MECHANISED THINGS MORE
I THINK MECHANISATION AND KIND OF USING US AS CONSUMERS MORE WHICH IS THE SELF SERVICE EXAMPLE I THINK YOU'RE DEFINITELY OPTIONS THE WORKPLACES WILL THINK ABOUT IT I SUPPOSE THE OTHER THING THAT IS CHANGING AT AROUND THE SAME TIME AS THE GOVERNMENT'S ALSO BRINGING THE APPRENTICESHIPS
AT LEAST FOR A LARGE EMPLOYERS THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE GIVEN THIS MUCH GREATER IMPETUS TOWARDS INVESTING IN TRAINING THROUGH APPRENTICESHIPS AND I THINK THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEWHERE PLACES AT LEAST WILL LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A LEVY ANYWAY SO HOW DO THEY GET SOME OF THAT MONEY BACK IN THE WAY THEY'LL GET SOME OF THAT MONEY BACK IS BY PROVIDING MORE APPRENTICESHIPS SO I THINK WE MIGHT SEE A TRAINING AFFECT AN EFFECT TOWARDS GREATER TRAINING IN THOSE WORKPLACES AND I'M IAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE MUST TELL YOU TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX NOW WAS ROBERT THE SPORT THEY STRONGER MORNING ROBIN THE TOP FOR THE PREMIER LEAGUE IN TWO MATCHES IT'S TEMPTING ISN'T IT TO REGARD THE OUTCOMES AS POTENTIALLY CRUCIAL TO THE TITLE RACE IN FACT ARSENAL AGAINST LEICESTER AND MANCHESTER CITY AGAINST TOTTENHAM WELL THEY'VE MANY COMPLICATED BATTERS HER TILL KEL'S THAT FREAK ARE GOING TO BE OFF THE BOX

IN ENGLAND IS FAILING MOST OF IT'S MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS THAT'S WHAT A BIG REVIEW OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HAS CONCLUDED MICHAEL BE CANNONS ARE SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT A REVIEW ORDERED BY THE N.H.S. ITSELF SO THEY CAN'T SAY WILL WE DISAGREE WITH THE COMPANY
NO THEY CAN'T THEY HAVEN'T THE DISAGREE WITH IT AT ALL IN FACT THEY HAVE ACCEPTED MOST OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN LAYING AT THE PROBLEMS FIRST BEFORE WE GET TO WHAT THEY AND EXCESS IN THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH THINK THE SOLUTIONS EFFECTIVELY WHAT THE TASK FORCE PHONE THIS INDEPENDENT TASK FORCE THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HAVE BEEN CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED FOR YEARS
PROVISION IS INADEQUATE AND THAT I DON'T ENOUGH QUALIFIED STAFF WERE UP IN THE MENTAL HEALTH BUTLER'S LEADING TO PATIENTS RECEIVING INCREASINGLY POOR DARLING AND NESSA NECESSARILY ARE WAITING MONTHS FOR TREATMENT STARTS ACTUALLY OF THE GET ANY TREATMENT AT ALL THE TASK FORCE ESTIMATES THAT THREE QUARTERS OF PATIENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ACTUALLY DON'T RECEIVE ANY SUPPORT AT ALL WAITING TIMES EXTRAORDINAIRE EXTRAORDINARILY LONG SOFA ONE TYPE OF THERAPY
THE WAITING TIME IS AT LEAST SIX MONTHS I DON'T KNOW CLIJSTERS CARE TEAMS THAT THAT HELPED PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I'M ENOUGH FOR THEM AND I AREN'T ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH LIAISON SUPPORT AND ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY UNITS WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE DON'T GET THE RIGHT KEY PERINATAL CARE OF MOTHERS NEWBORN MODEST WITH WOMAN WITH NEWBORN BABIES
THEY DEVELOP POSTNATAL DEPRESSION THEY DON'T GET ADEQUATE SUPPORT AT EITHER CHILDREN AS WE'VE REPORTED PREVIOUSLY BEEN SENT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF ARDENT ENOUGH BEDS IT'S A GOOD PICTURE ACROSS THE BOARD OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE ROD AND WE'RE TALKING THEN ABOUT TREATING PEOPLE WITH ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AS OPPOSED TO CARING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM BEING UM PROBLEM WITH IT IT WAS PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEPRESSION FOR INSTANCE WHO HAD TO WAIT MONTHS FOR FOR SUPPORT OF PEOPLE AN INPATIENT UNITS INPATIENT UNITS DESCRIBED AS IN MANY MANY INSTANCES NOT BEEN THERAPEUTIC BECAUSE THE OVERCROWDED THE REASON THEY'RE OVERCROWDED THIS BECAUSE
THE REASON THAT'S BECAUSE SERVICES ARE UNDER FUNDED UNDER HAVE BEEN CUT THEY'RE NOT BEING PROPERLY COMMISSION SO THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON INPATIENT FACILITIES WHICH IS MEANS THAT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AT ALL SORT NOT RECEIVING THE RIGHT CLEAR BECAUSE SERVICE IS GOOD ENOUGH AND EVEN WHEN YOU GET INTO HOSPITAL YOU DON'T GET THE SUPPORT YOU NEED EITHER THE N.H.S. IS SAYING WE WILL PUT MORE MONEY
THEY ARE SAYING THAT WE WILL PUT MORE MONEY OUT THE INVADING A FIVE YEAR STRATEGY THAT THEY THINK WILL TRANSFORM KEELED OVER THE COMING YEARS AN EXTRA BILLION POUNDS WILL BE SPENT BY TWENTY TWENTY TO HEALTH A MILLION PEOPLE BOTTLE DO THINGS ACCORDING TO N.H.S. ENGLAND LIKE HELP AN EXTRA SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE GET ACCESS TO TALKING THERAPIES FOR CONDITIONS LIKE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION THERE'LL BE A SCREENING PROGRAMME IN PLACE TO HELP MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS TO STOP THEM DYING FROM PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS COS AT THE MOMENT THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES THAT THE
THEY'RE NOT BEEN DIAGNOSED EARLY ENOUGH FOR THINGS AT HEART DISEASE THEY WERE MENTAL HEALTH TEAMS BUT INTO A. AND E. UNITS WOULD BE AND A RENEWED EFFORT TO REDUCE SUICIDE ACROSS ENGLAND THE MORE HELPFUL FOR A PREGNANT WOMAN AS WELL A NEW MOTHERS ON THERE WOULD ALSO BE MORE INVESTMENT AND I'M LOOKING AT BUT COMMISSIONING BETTER COMMUNITY SERVICES MICHAEL THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVENTH A FLIGHT TO NEW YORK OUT OF HEATHROW LAST NIGHT HAD TO TURN BACK AFTER SOMEONE ON THE GROUND POINTED A LASER BEAM AT THE COCKPIT AFFECTING THE SIGHT OF THE PILOT THIS IS HOW ONE OF THE VIRGIN ATLANTIC CREW ON BOARD REPORTED WHAT HAPPENED TO IRISH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL RECORDED BY THE WEBSITE AIRPORT WEBCAMS DOT
THAT WAS IRISH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL WILL A REPORTER NICK KORESHI IS HERE IN THE STUDIO IT DO WE KNOW HOW THE PILOT IS HOW IT AFFECTED HIM NO WE DO KNOW THAT THIS TOOK OFF JUST AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT DIDN'T TRAVEL VERY FAR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO PASSENGERS AND FIFTEEN CREW WERE HEADING FOR
NEW YORK'S J.F.K. AIRPORT JUST SIX MILES WEST OF HEATHROW SO A FEW MINUTES INTO THE FLIGHT THIS WE BELIEVE IS A EIGHT THOUSAND FEET THE COCKPIT WAS TARGETED BY THIS LASER WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED THE FLIGHT CONTINUED BUT AFTER A WHILE WHEN IT WAS NEAR SHANNON
THERE WAS AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS CONVERSATION WITH IRISH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL IN WHICH THE CO PILOT REPORTED FEELING UNWELL WE DON'T KNOW HOW HOW HE IS AT THIS STAGE PUT IT WAS CLEAR AS A PRECAUTION
BOTH PILOTS AND VIRGIN ATLANTIC TOOK THIS DECISION TO RETURN TO HEATHROW AND WE ASSUME IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH SIGHT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THAT'S THE WORRY ABOUT THESE LITTLE LASER BEAMS IS IT ISN'T IT THAT THEY CAN AFFECT AN INDIVIDUAL SITE AND IT IS SO MUCH SO THAT THIS WAS NEVER AN OFFENCE UNTIL TWENTY TEN A LAW WAS INTRODUCED IT'S GOT THIS TITLE
SHINING A LIGHT AT AN AIRCRAFT IN FLIGHT SO AS TO DAZZLE THE PILOTS THAT CAME IN IN TWENTY TEN IT MEANT SOMEBODY COULD BE CHARGED WITH THIS OFFENCE SIR CLEARLY IT DIDN'T DAMAGE THE EYESIGHT'S BALPA THE PILOTS' UNION LAST YEAR REFERRED TO THE CASE OF A BRITISH AIRWAYS CO PILOT THEY SAY WAS LEFT UNABLE TO FLY AND PARTIALLY BLINDED
AFTER A LASER IN THIS CASE WHAT THEY SAY WAS A MILITARY STRENGTH LASER WAS SHOWN INTO HIS EYE IRONICALLY IS HE PREPARED TO LAND AT HEATHROW AIRPORT'S OH KAY AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE FORTY EIGHT I THINK AT HEATHROW LAST YEAR INDEED THERE WERE THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN SO FAR IN THE FIRST
SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN FORTY EIGHT A HEATHROW AT FOUR HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN IN TOTAL TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY LASER INCIDENTS REPORTED THE PREVIOUS YEAR IN TWENTY FOURTEEN NICK PRESSURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT IN THE UNITED STATES HAS NINE MEMBERS AN ENORMOUS INFLUENCE OVER HOW THE LAWS OF THE LAND ARE INTERPRETED PARTICULARLY SOCIAL MATTERS SUCH AS GAY MARRIAGE AND ABORTION WHICH IS WHY THERE'S SO MUCH INTEREST IN WHO IS GOING TO REPLACE ONE OF THE MORE CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF THE COURT AND TONY SCO WHO DIED OVER THE WEEKEND AND WHETHER PRINT PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS TO MAKE THIS CHOICE ON WHOEVER SUCCEEDS HIM AFTER THE ELECTION JOHN SOPER IS A NORTH AMERICA EDITOR
THE SUPREME COURT MAKES ALL SORTS OF CRITICAL DECISIONS THAT POLITICIANS ARGUE ABOUT IN THEN CAN'T DECIDE ALSO TEXAS PASSES A LAW TO RADICALLY REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF ABORTIONS THAT THEN GOES TO THE SUPREME COURT IN THE SUPREME COURT JUDGES ON IT AT THE MOMENT IT WAS IT WAS FIVE FOUR BROADLY IN FAVOUR OF MORE CONSERVATIVE LEANING JUDGES IT'S NOW FOUR APIECE NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL YOU GET A NEW JUDGE APPOINTED THE QUESTION IS WILL BARACK OBAMA BE ABLE TO DO IT
AND IF HE CAN'T THIS THOUGHT THAT COME THIS NOVEMBER YOU WILL NOT ONLY YOU'LL BE ELECTING ESSENTIALLY THE RULERS OF THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT YOU'LL BE ELECTING THE PERSON WHO RUNS THE WHITE HOUSE THE EXECUTIVE YOU'LL BE ELECTING THE PERSON THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE LEGISLATURE THE CONGRESS AND YOU WILL BE ELECTING EFFECTIVELY WHO WILL BE THE NINTH MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT WHO MAKE DECISIONS ON ABORTION ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS
ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE YOU NAME IT THE SUPREME COURT WILL HAVE A SAY IN IT AND SO IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS SO MUCH BUT CLUTCHED AGITATION ABOUT IT SO IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT
IF THE DEMOCRATS GET THEIR WAY AND HAD THEIR SAY AS TO WHO IS THE NEW SUPREME COURT REMEMBER
THEN AMERICA WILL MOVE IN ONE DIRECTION IN PART AT LEAST FROM A MORE LIBERAL DIRECTION CONTINUING THE LIBERAL DIRECTION ITS TROUBLED AND IF NOT
IT WILL REVERSE THAT MOVEMENT I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FAIR ANALYSIS JOB I THINK THAT THERE IS THAT MUCH AT STAKE WITH WHO SITS ON THE SUPREME COURT AND WHO CAN GET NOMINATED TED CRUISE THE CONSERVATIVE TEXAN SENATOR
WHO IS RUNNING FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION SAYS EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE WITH THIS YOU COULD HAVE ALL SORTS OF RULES AT HANDED DOWN AND CHANGED ON THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS ON ABORTION ON ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS THAT CONSERVATIVES HOLD DEAR HE SAYS IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND SO SUBTLY WHO THE NEXT SUPREME
COURT JUDGE IS GOING TO BE IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST ELECTION PRE ELECTION ISSUES IN THIS CAMPAIGN WITH ALL THE REPUBLICAN SAYING BARACK OBAMA YOU'LL BE OVERSTEPPING YOUR MARKED RECOMMEND ANYBODY NOW
BUT ACTUALLY THE CONSTITUTION SAYS IT'S HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO SELECT WHO SHOULD BE THE NEXT SUPREME COURT JUDGE AND IT'S UP FOR THE SENATE TO THEN APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE
JOHN HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO GO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BLOODY AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN EASY WAY THROUGH IT I THINK BARACK OBAMA IF HE PROPOSES SOMEONE THAT HE'S TOO LIBERAL THE SENATE WILL VOTE IN DOWN AND IF IT IS SOMEONE THAT THE REPORT FOR THE REPUBLICANS LIKE THEN THE DEMOCRATS PROBABLY WON'T LIKE THE PERSON SO IT'S KIND OF IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE AN EASY WAY THROUGH THAT BARACK OBAMA WILL NOMINATE SOMETH SOMEBODY WHERE THAT PERSON THERE WILL THEN BE APPROVED ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MATTER JOHN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND TAKING A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND AS THE PRIME MINISTER PREPARES TO FINALISE A DEAL THIS WEEK ON BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP THERE IS CONTINUING INTEREST IN HOW SENIOR CONSERVATIVES WILL VOTE IN THE REFERENDUM THE TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH A STORY THAT BRITAIN'S MOST SENIOR LEGAL OFFICERS CONSIDERING JOINING THE CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE QUOTING SOURCES RATHER THAN THE MAN HIMSELF IT REPORTS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL JEREMY RIGHT IS CONCERNED THAT EUROPEAN COURTS ARE ERODING BRITAIN'S SOVEREIGNTY

THE PAPER SAYS HIS WORDS INCREASED SPECULATION HE MAY JOIN THE OUT CAMPAIGN THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA PROVIDES THE MAIN STORY FOR BOTH THE TIMES THE FINANCIAL TIMES BOTH WARNING OF CONCERNS THAT HER FRAGILE CEASEFIRE NEGOTIATED LAST WEEK MAY COLLAPSE BEFORE HE'S EVEN BEGUN THE TIME SAYS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE AN URGENT PHONE CALL TO THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN OVER THE WEEKEND TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO END MOSCOW'S HERE CAMPAIGN AGAINST
MODERATE OPPOSITION FORCES IN SYRIA THE F. TITO'S WESTERN DIPLOMATS BELIEVED THAT RUSSIA IS DELIBERATELY ATTACKING CIVILIANS IN NORTHERN SYRIA TO INCREASE THE FLOW OF REFUGEES FLEEING TOWARDS YOU UP THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MAIL IS DOMINATED BY TWO PHOTOGRAPHS IT SAYS SHAME THE N.H.S. IS OUT OF HOURS HOTLINE HOTLINE THEY SHOW WHAT ARE DESCRIBED AS AN EXHAUSTED PARAMEDIC AND CALL HANDLER FAST ASLEEP AT THEIR POSTS UNABLE TO HEAR POTENTIALLY LIFE OR DEATH CALLS COMING IN FROM PATIENTS

IN THE INTERVIEW MISTER HAD ALSO SAYS HE BELIEVE JUNIOR DOCTORS WILL COME TO REALISE THAT NEW CONTRACTS BEING IMPOSED ON THEM ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL OFFER AND SUBSTANTIALLY CLOSER TO WHAT THE DOCTOR'S UNION THE B.M.A. IS ASKING FOR THE HEADLINE IN THE INDEPENDENT REEDS ARE BOYCOTTING OF ISRAELI GOODS TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE THE PAPER SAYS LOCAL COUNCILS AND OTHER BODIES WHICH RECEIVE MOST OF THEIR FUNDING FROM THE GOVERNMENT OR TO BE BANNED BY LAW FROM REFUSING TO TRADE WITH COMPANIES THEY CONSIDER UNETHICAL
ON ISSUES SUCH AS FOSSIL FUELS TOBACCO PRODUCTS OR ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS IN THE WEST BANK IT QUITE SENIOR GOVERNMENT SOURCES ARE SAYING SUCH BOYCOTTS UNDERMINED GOOD COMMUNITY RELATIONS BUT CRITICS DESCRIBED THE MOVE AS A GROSS ATTACK ON DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS IT'S HARD TO GET AWAY FROM THE SMILING FACE OF LEONARDO DI CAPRIO ON MOST OF THE FRONT PAGES HE'S WON THE BEST ACTOR BAFTA HAVE CALLED FOR HIS ROLE IN THE REBEL AND IN SOME OF THE PAPERS HE JOINED BY KATE WINSLET YOU PICKED UP THE BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS

WE'RE A FORCE IN OUR OWN RIGHT WEAK CUBS NOT ROWS AND WHEN WE LOSE WE ARE ALLOWED TO BE A DAY WHEN WE ARE SAYING WHAT'S UP ME DUCK WE'RE NOT ENQUIRING ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE LOCAL WILDLIFE
AND KENNY THERE THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WESTERN COUNTRIES WENT TO WAR AND AFGHANISTAN NEARLY FIFTY YEARS AGO PART TO TRY TO TURN IT
INTO A MORE PEACEFUL STABLE COUNTRY IT HASN'T WORKED THAT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE LATEST FIGURES ON CIVILIAN CASUALTIES THEY ROSE LAST YEAR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT'S EVER BEEN RECORDED WELL I'M JOHN ON THE LINE BY MICHAEL SEMPLE WHO'S NOW VISITING PROFESSOR AT THE INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF CONFLICT AT QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST HAS HUGE EXPERIENCE OF AFGHANISTAN HIMSELF ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THIS MISTER TEMPLE
NO IT'S ANOTHER MILESTONE BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEY CONFLICT CONTINUES AT A HIGH LEVEL AND IN FACT HAS CREPT UP OVER THE ELEVEN THOUSAND MARK THAT'S ELEVEN THOUSAND CIVILIAN CASUALTIES ARE KILLED OR INJURED DURING LAST YEAR SO DOES THAT MEAN PEACE MAKING EFFORTS THE UNITED STATES MANY OTHER COUNTRIES WE'VE LOST AN AWFUL LOT OF MEN SPENT VAST FORTUNES IN AFGHANISTAN DOES IT MEAN THAT FAILED
IT MEANS IT TAKES AN AWFUL LONG TIME AND THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARGUED THAT WHOLE FEEL WITHDRAWING WESTERN FORCES FROM AFGHANISTAN AT THAT WAS SOMEHOW THERE SO THE SECRETS TO ENDING THE WAR I BELIEVE IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GET IT DO YOU TO BRING TROOPS HOME BUT IT WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ENOUGH THEY
AFGHAN NATIONAL SECURITY FORCES HAVE GOT TO GET BETTER AT PROTECTING THEIR COUNTRY THEIR GOVERNMENT'S GOT TO GET BETTER AT LEADING THE COUNTRY AND OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE PEACE PROCESS BUT FOR THE MOMENT THE CONFLICT CONTINUES AND THERE'S NO REASON TO SEE WHY I SHOULD END IS THERE IF THE TALIBAN ARE BEING SO SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR TERMS THAT IS TO SAY KILLING AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE POWER AND PRESUMABLY THEY'RE NO CLOSER TO ACHIEVING POWER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE SO WHY SHOULD THEY STOP
WELL THEY CERTAINLY THERE ARE THERE ARE THOSE IN THE MOVEMENT AND I GUESS THAT THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE LEADING THE THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT WHO WERE MAKING THAT ARGUMENT BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER ART FARMS INCLUDING SOME INSIDE THE TALIBAN WHO SAY THAT GIVEN THAT THEY ONLY ENJOY PERHAPS A SMALL MINORITY OF SUPPORT IN THE COUNTRY THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO IMPOSE THEIR WILL ON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND
THEIR DECISION TO SUSTAIN THEIR MILITARY CAMPAIGN JUST CONDEMNS THE COUNTRY TWO MORE YEARS OF THESE GRIM STATISTICS SO THE DECISION IS PARTLY IN THE HANDS OF THE TALIBAN DO THEY FIGHT ON IN THE HOPE OF VICTORY ORDER THE EXCEPT FOR THEIR GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR FELLOW A FRONT AND IF THEY DECIDE
TO DO THE FORMATIVE FIGHT ON WHO IS TO STOP THEM THE AFGHAN ARMY ISN'T CAPABLE OF IT
ULTIMATELY IT IS THE THE AFGHAN ARMY AND THE REST OF THE AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES THAT WILL BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY THERE'S YEAH IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT NO WESTERN COUNTRIES GOING TO TO BAIL THEM OUT ON THIS AND
AND THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE SERVING IN THE AFGHAN FORCES WHO ARE DETERMINED TO TRY AND PROTECT TO THE COUNTRY AND AT THE MOMENT TO NOW IT IS A IT IS A TRIAL OF STRENGTH WHICH CAN LAST FOR A VERY LONG TIME
WE HAVE TO SEE THIS CERTAINLY THIS YEAR IT CERTAINLY LOOKS BAD IN THE SENSE THAT THE THE THE THE TALIBAN LEADERS HAVE TOLD THEIR SUPPORTERS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TEETERING ON THE BRINK THAT ONE MORE PUSH THAT WE CAN OVERCOME THEM IT GOES DOWN TO A TRIAL OF A TRIAL OF STRENGTH
DURING THE YEAR IF OF COURSE IF THEY FAIL ON REMEMBER THAT THEY THEY WERE TAKING THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES THEMSELVES THERE COMES A POINT WHERE THOSE VOICES INSIDE THE MOVEMENT WHICH SAY THAT WELL WE SIGNED UP TO FIGHT AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL FORCES THE INTERNATIONAL FORCES ARE NO LONGER HERE IT'S TIME TO REACH A SETTLEMENT THERE COMES A POINT WHERE ARE THOSE VOICES HAVE GOT TO GET LOUDER INSIDE THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT AS WELL MICHAEL SIMPLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
BUT I'M GLAD SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN POORER CHILDREN DO BETTER AT SCHOOLS IN CITIES THAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S THE SUGGESTION FROM AN INVESTIGATION BY THE B.B.C.'S INSIDE OUT PROGRAMME IN THE MIDLANDS IT FOUND A DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN IN INNER CITY BIRMINGHAM WERE FAR MORE LIKELY TO GET FIVE GOOD GCSES THAN THOSE IN SHROPSHIRE OFSTED CALLED THE PERFORMANCE IN SHROPSHIRE APPALLING LORNA FITZJOHN IS OFT AS WEST MIDLANDS REGIONAL DIRECTOR
SHROPSHIRE IS ONE OF THE WORST PERFORMING AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE COUNTRY FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN ONLY ONE IN FOUR OF THOSE CHILDREN
GCS EIGHTY C. WITH ENGLISH AND MATHS THAT IS APPALLINGLY LOW I WAS TALKING TO COUNCILLORS AND THEY SEE THAT IN SHROPSHIRE CHILDREN ARE DOING WELL
BUT WHEN I SHOWED THEM THE FIGURES FOR THE DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN SNIFF THEM ARE REALLY QUITE SHOCKED BY THAT AND REALISE THERE'S MUCH MORE THAT THEY COULD DO TO HELP IMPROVE THAT ALAN DOWNSTAIRS THE HEAD TEACHER OF BISHOPS CASTLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE COUNTY
I THINK IT'S VERY EASY FOR STUDENTS FOR STAFF AND FOR PARENTS RESPECT
NOT TO HAVE HIGH ENOUGH ASPIRATIONS NOT TO ASPIRE TO BECOME DOCTORS LAWYERS TO WORK IN CITIES TO WORK ABROAD AND NOT SAYING THEY HAVE TO IN THE SLIGHTEST BUT THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF BEING SURROUNDED BY THE HILLS AND SOMEWHAT BEING CONFINED BY THEM WELL PROFESSOR SONIA BLANDFORD RUNS THE EDUCATION CHARITY ACHIEVEMENT FOR ALL SHE IS IN OXFORD GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR BAMFORD GOOD MORNING WE FOCUSED ON SHOCK SO THERE BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT COUNT IT SEEMS TO BE ACROSS THE PASTE THAT
CUT CUT RURAL AREAS HAVE A TOUGHER TIME AT LEAST FOR DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN INDEED THEY DO THEY'RE WELL BELOW THE NATIONAL ATTAINMENT LEVELS AND THEY'RE WELL BELOW THAT WHICH IS BEING ACHIEVED WITHIN THE CITIES AND URBAN AREAS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT OUR CHARITY ACHIEVEMENT FOR ALL IS FOCUSING ALL IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS VERY ISSUE IT'S NOT I MEAN FOR THOSE WHO ARE BETTER OFF THE MORE ADVANTAGE CHILDREN IT'S A DIFFERENT PICTURE ISN'T IT BECAUSE THEY
PICTURES SUGGEST THAT RURAL SCHOOLS DO BETTER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ON THE WHOLE THEY DO HOWEVER THE GAP BETWEEN THOSE THAT ACHIEVE ON THOSE THAT DON'T IS MARKED AND THE WAY IN WHICH THAT REPRESENTED IS THOSE THAT ARE LIVING
PERHAPS IN POVERTY OR IN LOW INCOME FAMILIES THERE ARE TWO POINT THREE MILLION CHILDREN YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING IN LOW INCOME AND POVERTY HAVE FAMILIES THEY'RE NOT ACHIEVING AT THE SAME LEVEL THERE'S A HIGH PROPORTION OF THOSE THAT LIVE IN RURAL AREAS SO WHAT DO YOU THINK RURAL SCHOOLS ARE NOT DOING THAT THOSE IN URBAN AREAS ARE
I THINK THERE WERE THREE THINGS I THINK AS THE THE HEAD TEACHER COMMENTED THEY HAVE THERE'S NO ASPIRATION PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE THAT COME FROM DISADVANTAGED FAMILIES THOSE THAT HAVE A LACK OF CONNECTION WITH SCHOOLS SO THE PARENTS CARERS LEADERS AND TEACHERS WORKING TOGETHER THAT'S NOT HAPPENING IN THESE AREAS FOR THESE CHILDREN THERE ISN'T THAT SENSE OF CAN DO THERE ISN'T THAT SENSE
I WANT TO ACHIEVE NOT NECESSARILY TO BECOME DOCTORS OR LAWYERS BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GO TO UNIVERSITY BUT TO PICK UP ON APPRENTICESHIPS TO PICK ON SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO DRIVE THEM OUT OF THE SITUATION THAT THEY'RE IN THERE'S ALSO THE SITUATION WHERE THEY ARE AND THEY'RE NOT ACCESSING AND THIS IS THAT THE COMMUNITIES AS A WHOLE THERE NOT ACCESSING ROOTS
TO OTHER FORMS OF EDUCATION SO THERE'S A SENSE OF ISOLATION IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WHICH THEN LEADS SCHOOLS TO BE A LITTLE BIT COMPLACENT ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE SUFFERING DISADVANTAGE AND LARGELY BECAUSE THEY LEFT THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS INDUCE YOU'VE QUOTED SHROPSHIRE FOR THOSE ABOVE THE POVERTY LEVEL ABOVE AND THAT THOSE THAT HAVE REASONABLE INCOME THEY ARE IT IS QUITE HIGH
SO WHAT THEY'RE COMPLACENT THEY THINK WE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT AND THEN ACTUALLY AT THOSE WHO ARE FOR POORER KIDS THEY'RE JUST NOT DOING WELL ENOUGH ABSOLUTELY SO THERE'S TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT OF COURSE CHILDREN THOSE IN LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAT
ARE NOT ACHIEVING TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT THAT'S ONE IN FIVE OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND THAT'S ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF RURAL RURAL SETTINGS BUT IN SHROPSHIRE ONE IN FOR WHEN YOU THINK OF THE REPORT THAT CAME OUT LAST WEEK FROM THE SEE WHICH SAID THAT THIS COUNTRY IS FALLING WAY BEHIND OTHER COUNTRIES WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS RURAL ISSUE WE REALLY DO
O.K. PROFESSOR AT SONIA BLANDFORD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

I'M CHRIS BOWLBY AND IN THE FIRST OF A NEW RADIO FOUR SERIES ON MIGRATION IN EUROPE I'LL BE EXPLORING GERMANY'S UNIQUE EXPERIENCE AND I'LL DISCOVER HOW THAT HISTORY'S LEFT THE COUNTRY POISED BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL CHANGE AND PERMANENCE MIGRATION ANGST

ALMOST A BILLION POUNDS A YEAR
AS WELL AS REPLACING THE HEAD OF THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY WHO WAS DISLIKED BY SOME BANKS ALTHOUGH THE ENVIRONMENT MAY HAVE CHANGED SOMEWHAT IN BRITAIN CHINA'S GROWING INTERFERENCE IN HONG KONG AND THE RISK OF A GLOBAL SLOWDOWN MAY HAVE ALSO PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN KEEPING H.S.B.C. IN LONDON THE BANK SAID IT WOULD ONLY REVIEW WHERE IT IS BASED IN FUTURE IF THERE WERE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES IT DIDN'T SPECIFY WHETHER THAT WOULD INCLUDE BRITAIN'S VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THE MAN WHO LED AN INQUIRY INTO THE FUTURE SAFETY OF BRITAIN'S BANKS HAS HAD PLANS DRAWN UP BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH SO JOHN VICKERS WHO HEADED THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON BANKING SAID BANK SHOULD HAVE MORE CAPITAL IN RESERVE TO ENABLE THEM TO SURVIVE ANY FUTURE FINANCIAL CRISIS WITHOUT A BILL OUT FROM THE TAXPAYER

AFTER THE TRIP HIS LETTERS SUGGEST A MAN STRUGGLING TO MAKE SENSE OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP IN CHRISTIAN TERMS ONE FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX SAYS MY DEAR THERESA YOU WRITE ABOUT BEING TORN APART BUT I COULD FIND NO ANSWER TO THESE WORDS
THERE'S NO SUGGESTION THAT THE POPE BROKE ANY VOW OF CELIBACY BUT THE LETTERS SHOW THE HUMAN SIDE OF HER MUCH LOVED POPE DOING ONE OF THE LONELIEST JOBS ON EARTH AND THERE'LL BE MORE ON THIS STORY ON PANORAMA AT EIGHT THIRTY TONIGHT ON B. B. C. ONE
A CENTURIES OLD TRADITION OF USING VELLUM TO RECORD PARLIAMENTARY LEGISLATION HAS BEEN SAVED IT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THAT VELLUM WAS BEING PHASED OUT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE BUT THE CABINET OFFICER STEPPED IN TO FOOT THE BILL HERE'S NINA WORE HURST
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS SOME OF BRITAIN'S MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS INCLUDING THE MAGNA CARTA AND THOUSANDS OF ACTS OF PARLIAMENT HAD BEEN RECORDED ON VELLUM OR PARCHMENT MADE FROM CALFSKIN
THAT TRADITION WAS DUE TO COME TO AN END IN APRIL AFTER THE HOUSE OF LORDS DECIDED USING SPECIAL PAPER INSTEAD WOULD SAVE THE TAXPAYER EIGHTY THOUSAND A YEAR
BUT NOW THE PAYMASTER GENERAL MATT HANCOCK SAYS THE CABINET OFFICE MONEY WILL BE USED TO CONTINUE THE TRADITION HE TOLD THE B.B.C. WHILE THE WORLD AROUND US CONSTANTLY CHANGES WE SHOULD SAFEGUARD SOME OF OUR GREAT TRADITIONS AND NOT LET THE USE OF VELLUM DIE OUT THE CABINET OFFICE SPOKESMAN SAYS THEY'RE NOW INVESTIGATING DIFFERENT WAYS TO COVER THE COST

I THINK THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN H.S.B.C. IS EUROPE'S BIGGEST BANK AND IT HAS ITS HEADQUARTERS HERE IN LONDON SO THERE WAS GREAT CONSTERNATION WHEN A YEAR AGO HE THREATENED HE MIGHT PULL OUT AND MOVED TO HONG KONG IT WOULD'VE BLOWN A GREAT HOLE IN THIS COUNTRY'S REPUTATION AS THE BANKING CAPITAL OF THE WORLD WHERE MIGHT IT HAVE LED THE THING IS IT WAS WORRIED
ABOUT BANKING REGULATIONS AND ABOUT THE EURO REFERENDUM BUT NOW IT WAS DECIDED THAT IT IS GOING TO STAY IS OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR WE KNOW WHY COME ON I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE CHAIRMAN
WELL JOHN IF I HELLO FROM CANARY WHARF IN THE HEART REALLY OF BANKING IN THE U.K. HERE IN LONDON AN AREA DOMINATED BY H.S.B.C. SKYSCRAPER H.Q. WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOW GOING TO STAY CERTAINLY A SIGH OF RELIEF ACROSS GOVERNMENT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR SIGNAL AS YOU SUGGEST JOHN IF H.S.B.C. HAD LEFT ABOUT THE POWER OF THE CITY THE STRENGTH OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY THIRTY SINCE THE ELECTION
THE ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED THE BANKING LEVY WHICH WAS A TAX WHICH COST H.S.B.C. ONE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR IS BEING SCRAPPED GEORGE OSBORNE OR SPOKEN OF A NEW SETTLEMENT WITH THE CITY AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING TODAY ON THE PROGRAMME SIR JOHN VICKERS THE HEAD OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON BANKING HAS RAISED FEARS THAT CONTROLS PUT IN PLACE TO REDUCE THE RISKS OF ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT STAR CRASH THE SO CALLED RING FENCE
HE SAID HE'S BEEN WEAKENED I'M JOINED BY DOUGLAS FLINT THE CHAIRMAN OF H.S.B.C. HELLO MISTER FLINT WHY THE DECISION TO STAY IN LONDON CRITICS MIGHT SAY THE GOVERNMENT HAS BENT OVER BACKWARDS SIMPLY TO ACCOMMODATE YOU
GOOD MORNING WELL FRANKLY LONDON OFFERED THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS FOR US IT'S JUST P.C. AT ITS HEART A BANK FOCUSED AND TRADE AND INVESTMENT FLOWS THE U.K. IS ONE OF THE MOST GLOBALLY CONNECTED ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD WITH A WITH A FANTASTIC REGULATORY SYSTEM AND LEGAL SYSTEM AN IMMENSE EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
THE GOVERNMENT'S MADE A VERY CLEAR ITS COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT THE U.K. REMAINS A LEADING INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SENSE I THINK WE CAN SEE THAT IN A NUMBER OF WAYS AND MOST PARTICULARLY RECENTLY IN LONDON'S LEADING ROLE IN WESTERN MARKETS WITH THE R.M.B. AND THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT AND I THINK WE'VE ENDED UP WITH THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS A PIVOT TO ASIA LEAD FROM FROM LONDON
NOW THE BANKING LEVIED A TAX THAT SO AFFECTED YOU ONE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR IT COST YOU YOU ANNOUNCED IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR YOU WERE THINKING OF LEAVING LONDON THE GOVERNMENTS OF RATHER CONVENIENTLY THREE MONTHS LATER ANNOUNCED THE BANKING LEVY WAS BEING SCRAPPED HOW MUCH OF AN EFFECT DID THAT HAVE ON YOUR DECISION MAKING
I THINK WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE SCOPE OF THE LEVY A LEVY BASED ON AN INTERNATIONAL BALANCE SHEETS AN INCIDENT THAT'S INTERNATIONAL BIOLOGY WAS A DISINCENTIVE FOR A FOR A GLOBAL GROUP AND WE MADE THAT POINT EVER SINCE THE START OF THE LEVEE SO IT WAS GOOD TO SEE THAT THE SCOPE OF THE LEVEE CHANGED TO BEING A DOMESTIC IN PAST AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK YOU FORCED THE GOVERNMENT'S HAND
I THINK NO I DON'T DO WE WE HAD NO NEGOTIATION WITH THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR'S VERY WELL OVER VIEW INDEED THE VIEW OF MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO COMMENTED UPON IT BUT THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO PRESSURE PUT OR AN A NEGOTIATION DO YOU THINK THE REGULATOR REGIME IN THE U.K. HAS SOFTENED HAS GOT BETTER FOR BANK
IT'S GOOD BETTER IT HAS CERTAINLY HASN'T SOFTENED I THINK AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT HAS BEEN LEARNT SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND I THINK THAT THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THE SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY AND NECESSARILY IMPROVED I CERTAINLY IN MY VIEW HASN'T BEEN SOFTENED
NOW OF COURSE THERE WERE PUSHED ACTORS FROM THE U.K. BUT ALSO THERE WERE ISSUES AROUND THE OTHER OPTION WHICH APPEAR TO BE HONG KONG
WAS PART OF YOUR THINKING ABOUT STAYING IN LONDON CONNECTED WITH THE INCREASING ECONOMIC CONCERNS ABOUT CHINA AND THE REGULATOR CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE CHINESE CENTRAL BANK WAS ACTING IN THE MARKETS WHICH ARE CREATED THIS GREAT VOLATILITY
FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THAT IT WAS AN ENORMOUS PRIVILEGE SIR AT THE END OF THE DAY TO BE CHOOSING BETWEEN TWO OF THE WORLD'S GREAT FINANCIAL CENTRES WE TOOK TEN MONTHS TO MAKE THIS DECISION THAT WAS A DECISION BASED ON HOPEFULLY WILL BE A GENERATIONAL VIEW IT WAS NOT BASED ON SHORT TERM DYNAMICS MARKET DYNAMICS ECONOMIC DYNAMICS IT WAS BASED ON A VERY THOUGHTFUL PERSPECTIVE ON HOW
ECONOMICS WILL PLAY OUT OVER THE NEXT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AT THE END OF THAT END OF THAT REVIEW WE ENDED UP BELIEVING THAT THE COMBINATION OF THE HEADQUARTERS IN LONDON AND THE PIVOT TO ASIA WHERE A MAJOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES I WAS THE BEST ANSWER
CAN I ASK YOU A BIT ABOUT EUROPE YOU YOUR BANK HAS RAISED FEARS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. THE EFFECTS ON THIS CITY BUT YOU'VE DECIDED TO STAY AS YOU ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT IT SEEMS WHATEVER THE RESULTS OF THE E. U. REFERENDA WHICH WERE EXPECTING OBVIOUSLY LATER THIS YEAR IT SHOWS REALLY NOT AS MUCH OF A RISK AS YOU MAYBE HAD SUGGESTED
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S RIGHT WE DID A MAJOR PIECE OF ECONOMIC RESEARCHER YEAR A GIRL WHICH SAID THAT IN OUR VIEW BRITAIN HAD BENEFITED FROM EUROPE AND THE BEST ANSWER ECONOMICALLY WAS FOR BRITAIN TO BE WITHIN A REFORMED EUROPE PUSHING FOR COMPLETION OF THE SINGLE MARKET PARTICULARLY IN SERVICES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE REFERENDUM DOESN'T HAVE MUCH IMPACT ON A HOLDING COMPANY WHICH IS SIMPLY A HOLDING COMPANY BUT POTENTIALLY DOES HAVE AN EMPIRE
ON THE OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF OF A WHOLESALE BANK WE'RE LUCKY IN A SENSE THAT WE HAVE A MAJOR BANK IN FRANCE SO IF WE WERE TO LEAVE AND IF THEY WERE TO BE RESTRICTIONS ULTIMATELY ON THE RENEGOTIATION OF BRITAIN'S POSITION WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE IT TOOK THE TOON PEOPLE BETWEEN LONDON AND PARIS BUT AS I SAID A STRONG ECONOMIC VIEW IS THAT BRITAIN IS BETTER WITHIN A REFORMED EUROPE
CAN I JUST ASK YOU ABOUT SIR JOHN VICKERS COMMENTS ABOUT THE RING FENCE THAT THERE IS A DANGER THAT THAT SYSTEM WHICH SEPARATES RETAIL BANKING FROM RATHER RISKY INVESTMENT BANKING IS BEING WE COULDN'T DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT NO I DON'T I THINK I THINK IT WAS HER
I THINK IT WAS A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH THAT HE TOOK TO THAT AND WE'RE PUTTING IT IN PLACE IT DOESN'T FEEL WATERED DOWN TO ME I THINK IT DID A STRUCTURAL REFORM THAT WILL SHOW US BENEFITS OVER TIME
MY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL AS YOU CAN HEAR THEIR RELIEF CERTAINLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S H.S.B.C. HIS DECISION TO STAY IN LONDON ONE THAT THEY ARGUE COMES FROM THE FACT THAT LONDON IS A GREAT FINANCIAL CENTRE AND INTERESTINGLY I THINK THE FACT THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION REFERENDUM HERE IN THE U.K. WILL NOT HAVE AS BIG AN IMPACT AS MAYBE SOME THOUGHT BACK TO YOU
HOW MANY BAGS IT IS NOW FORTY OR SIXTY MINUTES BOSS
A PLANE TRAVELLING TO NEW YORK WAS FORCED TO RETURN TO HEATHROW LAST NIGHT AFTER SOMEONE ON THE GROUND POINTED A LASER BEAM AT THE COCKPIT AFFECTING THE SIGHT OF THE PILOT THE VIRGIN ATLANTIC AIRCRAFT HAD ONLY JUST TAKEN OFF WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PASSENGERS ON BOARD WHEN IT HAD TO ASK AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FOR PERMISSION TO RETURN OR JANET ALEXANDER IS A COMMERCIAL AIRLINE PILOT JOINS US ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO COP IT

GEN ALEXANDER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHEN THEY SET ABOUT BUILDING THE NEW SHOPPING CENTRE OVER MORE THAN A SHOPPING CENTRE TRANSFORMING THE CENTRE OF BIRMINGHAM A FEW YEARS AGO EVERYBODY SAID HE'S GOT TO WORK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT'S GOING TO BE THE
THE NEW WITH A BIG STEP TOWARDS A NEW NORTH IF YOU CONSIDER THE MIDLANDS THE NORTH BUT ANYWAY THERE IT IS THEY SAID IT WAS AWFULLY IMPORTANT WILL NOW A YEAR ON WE HAVE THE FIRST RESULTS FROM THE COMPANY THAT DID ALL THAT WORK AND TANYA WHAT IS THE VERDICT WELL THE BROAD RESULTS BECAUSE OF COURSE THIS COMPANY HARRISON OWNS A LOT OF SHOPPING CENTRES RIGHT ACROSS EUROPE THE BROUGHT RESULTS APPEAR TO BE THAT SHOPPERS ARE OUT THERE AND THEY'RE BUYING AT THE MOMENT AND WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING JOHN
IS WHERE THEY ARE DOING THEIR BUYING AND WHAT SORT OF RETAIL EXPERIENCE IS ACCEPTABLE TO THEM AFTER ALL MANY PEOPLE SHOP NOW THESE DAYS ONLINE DOWN THE LINE IT IS DAVID ADKINS FROM HAMMER SOME P.L.C. GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO THESE ARE FOR YOU WHAT ARE THEY TELLING US ABOUT BIRMINGHAM OR IS IT STILL A LITTLE BIT EARLY TO TELL
WHILE IT'S RELATIVELY EARLY SHOPPING CENTRE GRAND CENTRAL OPENED IN THE AUTUMN BUT THE FIGURES OVER CHRISTMAS WERE VERY POSITIVE YOU LOOK AT OUR SALES FIGURES WERE HEADING TOWARDS TWO PER CENT FOR THE YEAR AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT IMPROVE CONFIDENCE PARTICULARLY IN NEED VERY LARGE EXPERIENTIAL SHOPPING CENTRES IS INCREASED DEMAND FROM OUR RETAILERS AND THAT'S DRIVING AN INCREASE IN RENT EXPERIENTIAL WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT SORT OF EXPERIENCE TO SHOPPERS WANT
PEOPLE WANT IS A FULL RANGE OF THEIR BEST RETAIL THAT IS ON OFFER FROM AROUND THE WORLD THEY WANT TO ANYONE BUT ONE OF THE JOHN LEWIS THE SELFRIDGES AND YOU GET THEM IN IN ORDER TO ATTRACT SHOPPERS THAT'S PART ABSOLUTELY BUT THEY WANT TO ENJOY THAT IN THE VERY BIGGEST PRESS STORES HE WALK IN LITERALLY HAVE THE WOW FACTOR THE THEATRE THAT ONLY A PHYSICAL SHOPPING CENTRE CAN OFFER
AND THAT IS WHAT SHOPPERS INCREASINGLY ARE DEMANDING O.K. K. SO WHAT SORT OF THEATRE DO YOU OFFER WHAT DO YOU THINK'S IMPORTANT WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE STORES WITHIN THE BORING A NEW RIVER ISLAND STORE A NEW TOP SHOP'S STORE VICTORIA SECRETS EASILY
BIGGEST STORY BUT WHAT ABOUT HERE WITH THE FOOD AVAILABLE ON THE PLAZA AND IN A SHOPPING CENTRE AND SO ON IS THAT IMPORTANT WELL OF COURSE IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM PEOPLE NEED REFUELLING IN ORDER TO STAY SHOPPING AND IN MANY OF OUR SHOPPING CENTRES WE OFFER PER TWENTY TO THIRTY RESTAURANTS WE SEE THAT RESTAURANTS AND CINEMAS INCREASED DWELL TIME BY UP TO TWENTY PER CENT AND IN
PROVE RETAIL SALES FOR THE WHOLE CENTRE BY UP TO FOUR TO FIVE PER CENT SO HOW WOULD YOU SAY THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT IS DOING RIGHT NOW GIVEN THAT THE RECOVERY IS ALWAYS BEING QUESTIONED WHILE I THINK CLEARLY THERE ARE AREAS THAT STILL UNDER PRESSURE HIGH STREETS UNDER PRESSURE BUT OVERALL IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAJOR SHOPPING CENTRES THAT WE OWN THEN I WOULD SAY THAT RETAIL IS RECOVERING WELL I THINK RETAILERS AND SHOPPERS KNOW WHERE THEY WANT TO SHOP
AND THEY'RE COMING OUT AND DOING IT AND YOUR PROFITS ARE UP AS A RESULT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU

HAS UNCOVERED HUNDREDS OF LETTERS THAT TELL THE STORY OF HOW GOD PUT IAN WITH HIS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP OVER THE YEARS TO A MARRIED WOMAN ANYWAY EDWARD IS THE REPORTING OF THIS IN YOU READ ALL THE LETTERS AND BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT A BIG QUESTION A FASCINATING LETTERS FASSE IGNORANCE FASCINATING STORY AND I GOT IT JUST THROUGH COMBINATION FROM SORT OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED JOURNALISTIC LUCK AND GRAFT I PICKED UP A RUMOUR THAT
LADY THERESA TIM AND ESKIL WHO I KNEW ABOUT COS SHE HAS A WALK ON PART IN A LOT OF JOHN PAUL'S BIOGRAPHIES OR SOMEBODY WHO COLLABORATED ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE VERSION OF THE BOOK HE WROTE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES I PICKED UP A RUMOUR THAT SHE HAD SOLD HER CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE POPE TOOK A FEW YEARS ACTUALLY SORT OF SLEUTHING AROUND TO DRILL HE'S LET US DOWN I KEPT IT VERY QUIET IT HAS WELL IT'S A SORT OF STORY CAN TELL YOU'VE GOT IT
WE EVENTUALLY FOUND THEM AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF POLAND AND AFTER MODE GETS ATION WE PERSUADED THEM TO LET US TRANSLATE THEM AND SEE THEM AND FILM THEM HERE THEY ARE AND SOME OF THE PLANTS HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OFF THERE ARE RATHER MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY WITH THEY'RE ABOUT THREE AND FIFTY WE'D START IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE WHEN THEY FIRST MET THE LAST ONE IS DATED JUST A FEW MONTHS BEFORE JOHN PAT'S DEATH TWO THOUSAND FORTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN FACT WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT SHE TERESA WAS WITH HIM AT HIS DEATH BUT THE DAY BEFORE HE DIED
AND THEY ARE JUST THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WINDOW ON THE PRIVATE SIDE OF ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS FACES IN HISTORY IT'S ABSOLUTELY SO LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE AND YOUR QUESTION HER QUESTION RELATIONSHIP DEFIES DEFINITION I WOULD SAY THEY WERE MORE THAN FRIENDS UNLESS THEM LOVERS AND I'M CONVINCED OF TWO THINGS ONE THAT SHE DIDN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM IN THE EARLY STAGES BUT SHE TALKED HIM AND THAT HE NEVER BROKE BROKE HIS VOW OF CELIBACY I LIKE ONE OF THE FASCINATING
STORIES THAT COMES OUT OF THIS THESE LETTERS IS OF A STRUGGLE TO CONTAIN WHAT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY INTENSE RELATIONSHIP WHICH MIXED EMOTIONS AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WAY TO CONTAIN IT IN A SORT OF PROPER CHRISTIAN
BOUNDARY AND HE COULD DO IT COS HE HAD THIS PROVIDENTIAL IDEA OF HIS LIFE HE BELIEVED EVERYTHING HE DID WAS DIRECTED BY GOD SO HE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS A GIFT FROM GOD AND I JUST READ YOU A COUPLE OF PASTURES IF I MAY THIS IS WENT ONE PARTICULARLY SORT OF TURBULENT LES WHEN HE SAYS
ONCE I REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN AND WHERE I HEARD THESE WORDS I BELONG TO YOU AND FOR ME FIRST OF ALL THE GIFT OF A PERSON RESONATED IN THEM I WAS AFRAID OF THIS GIFT BUT I KNEW FROM THE BEGINNING AND I STILL KNOW BETTER AND BETTER THAT I HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS GIFT AS THE GIFT FROM HEAVEN AND THEN IN THE SAME THAT HE SAYS IF I DIDN'T HAVE THIS CONVICTION SOME MORAL CERTAINTY OF GRAYSON OF ACTING IN OBEDIENCE TO IT I WOULDN'T DARE TO ACT LIKE THIS SO IT'S A REALLY FAST AND THE OTHER I THINK
THE POINT IS THAT OF COURSE IT GOES ON ALL HIS LIFE AND YOU GET FROM HIS OLD AGE TRADITIONAL OUT HOW LONG THEY WERE CHORISTER YES I HAVE SHEILA'S IN HIS OLD AGE SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ENORMOUS SORT OF COMFORT TO HIM WHEN HE WAS THE REAL THEM RATHER ISOLATED IN THE VASCULAR MAY SWAP MEMORIES THEY TALK ABOUT SKIING TRIPS THAT THEY'VE TAKEN TOGETHER HE WRITES FOR FOR EXAMPLE AFTER HIS FINAL TRIP TO POLAND THREE YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH
A MUTUAL HOMELAND SO MANY PLACES WHERE WE MET WHERE WE HAD CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE SO IMPORTANT TO US WHERE WE EXPERIENCE THE BEAUTY OF GOD'S PRESENCE MAKES STUFF ABSOLUTELY BUT YOU SAY MORE THAN FRIENDS BUT NOT LOVE US YEAH I WANT TO BUT WERE THEY THEN DO WE KNOW I THINK HE'S THERE AT THIS I THINK LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE MESS US ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE CONCLUSION I'D DRAW FROM YEAH THEY WERE THEY DID THEY WERE BOTH PASSIONATE ABOUT FROST FREE AND THEY MIXED
THEIR EMOTIONS AND THEIR IDEAS ON THESE TWO THINGS BECAME VERY TIED UP WITH EACH OTHER BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE LATER LETTERS YOU GET A RATHER TOUCHING PICTURE OF THINGS THE SHARED MEMORIES I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE SHE SENT SOME FLOWERS FROM PRESSED FLOWERS FROM THE GARDEN IN VERMONT WHERE HE STAYED WITH HER FOR A WHILE IN THE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND HE KEEPS ASKING AND SAYS I COME SPECTACLE POMFRET INSTEAD I COME TO POMFRET IN MY MIND EVERY DAY SO THERE'S A SORT OF
SENSE OF A SHARED HISTORY THAT A QUICK THOUGHT ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BOOK THAT THEY WORK DONE WELL THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT WHEN IT WAS SHE RUSHES OUT WHEN HE BECAME POPE INEVITABLY AND THE VASCULAR VERY ANGRY THEY TOOK LEGAL ACTION AGAINST TURNED TO TO EXPLAIN WHY LET'S JUST HEAR FROM JOHN CORNWALL WHO'S THE AUTHOR OF THE PULL OF THE POPE IN WINTER THE DARK FACE OF JOHN PAUL THE SECOND'S PAPACY
THE NOTION THAT ANOTHER PERSON HAD IN FACT BEEN THE AUTHOR OF A VERY IMPORTANT DOC
AND HOPE HAVE ALL PERSONS OF WOMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AND I'LL ACCEPT
AND JUST TO PICK UP BRIEFLY ON THAT ITS IMPORTANCE BECAUSE THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH YOU HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON HIS THINKING OF AS WELL AS BEING MIXED UP WITH THEM EMOTIONALLY HE'S VERY SENSITIVE ONE OF THE EVIDENCE OF THE LESSER STRESSY SHE MATCH WE'VE HAD QUITE A CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON HIM WELL CONGRATULATIONS A GREAT SCOOP IT WOULD AND WE WILL SEE IT AT EIGHT THIRTY ON B.

SERIOUSLY ILL AS A TEENAGER YOU HAD ANOREXIA YOU WERE DANGEROUSLY THIN AND YOU WERE REFERRED TO A LOCAL EATING DISORDER CLINIC AND THE TREATMENT YOU HAD WAS NOT GOOD
YEAH THAT'S CORRECT SO I BEGAN USING THE SERVICE AROUND MY G.C.S.E. AND I ENDED UP USING IT RIGHT TO ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE I WAS EIGHTEEN
AND I USED TO SERVICES WHEN THERE'S TIME BOTH WITH VERY CONTRASTING APPROACHES SO THE FIRST YEAR I USED WHEN I MOVED SCHOOL TO BE CLOSE TO HOME
THIS UNIT BASICALLY TO PUT IT BLUNTLY DID KIND OF THROW ME OUT I WAS I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS STILL ABLE TO USE THE SERVICE AND I MY PARENTS MADE THE DECISION TO KEEP TRAVELLING MADE TO AND FORTH FROM SCHOOL TO VISIT THE SAME SERVICE AS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU BUILD A RAPPORT WITH YOUR COUNSELLOR TO MAINTAIN ACCENTS IT CAN BE QUITE STRESSFUL RE TELLING YOUR STORY
AND BASICALLY I HAD A BOOK TO FORWARD APPOINTMENTS WITH HER WHILE SHE WAS ON HOLIDAY I I HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WHICH BASICALLY I WAS TOLD THIS IS YOUR HAVE YOU AND
YEAH THIS IS YOUR VIEW AND WE CAN'T WE CAN'T DEAL WITH YOU ANY MORE I'M SORRY THAT WAS THE END OF IT AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT TO GO AWAY BASICALLY AND YOU WERE ILL AT THE TIME YEAH I MADE NO PROGRESS WHILST AT THAT CLINIC AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE WAS ABOUT A GAP OF FIVE WEEKS WHERE I WAS FROM SPEAKING TO MY PARENTS LIKE I THINK THEY WERE JUST TOTALLY BESIDES HIMSELF DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT TIME
I WAS DEFINITELY MY LOWEST LOWEST WAY A B.M.I. OF WELL I THINK I WAS ABOUT FORTY THIRTY NINE KILOGRAMS VERY VERY VERY ILL RIGHT AND IN THE END IT DID GET SORTED OUT YOU'RE WELL NOW YEAH DEFINITELY I MEAN I'M
PERFECTLY HAPPY AT UNIVERSITY NOW SO IT DOES JUST SHOW WHAT
AMAZING CARE I HAD MY SECOND CLINIC AND THAT IT CAN BE DONE CORRECTLY SO YOU WENT TO ANOTHER CLINIC AND THAT WORKED DEFINITE I HAPPY RESULT AT THE END OF IT WILL THANK YOU FOR TELLING US ABOUT THAT AND LET'S TURN TO PAUL FARMER WHO'S NOT ONLY THE CHIEF EXEC OF MIND BE ALSO CHAIRS THE INDEPENDENT MENTAL HEALTH TASKFORCE YOU'LL NOT BE SURPRISED BY WHAT YOU HAD BEEN WARNING THAT THIS WAS A CASE FOR A LONG TIME ANOTHER IS PROVES THAT HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED
I THINK I THINK NATALIE'S CASE IS NOT ATYPICAL OVERCOME A VERY PATCHY EXPERIENCE SOMETIMES IT'S RECEIVING REALLY EXCELLENT CARE FROM VERY DEDICATED MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND THEN SOMETIMES NOT RECEIVING THAT CARE AT ALL AND WAS A REPORT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS IS THAT AS OUR ATTITUDE
GENERALLY IN THE PUBLIC ARE CHANGING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IT'S NOW TIME FOR THE N.H.S. ITSELF TO CHANGE THE WAY IT REALLY THINKS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT DOESN'T JUST MEAN THINKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HE MEANS THINKING ABOUT THE WHOLE OF THE N.H.S. ABOUT WHAT GOES ON IN PRIMARY CARE IN ACUTE HOSPITALS AND MORE BROADLY IS THERE A DANGER THAT WE SIMPLY WISH STILL DON'T PROPERLY REGARD MENTAL HEALTH AS
A HEALTH PROBLEM IN THAT THERE IS STILL SOME SORT OF HANGOVER OF THE DAYS WHEN WE THOUGHT OH WELL YOU KNOW THEY'RE A BIT STRANGE OR SOMETHING I MEAN BIZARRELY WELL I MEAN THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SOME OF THE STIGMA STILL PREVAILS RIGHT THE WAY INSIDE THE HEALTH SERVICE IN THE SAME WAY AS SOME OF THE STIGMA STILL PREVAILS IN WIDER SOCIETY LIKE A BROKEN LEG WELL IT'S NOT EXCEPT OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF SIMILARITIES WENT GETTING HELP AND ACCESS TO TREATMENT QUICKLY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO
IT ISN'T ACCEPTABLE THAT THERE ISN'T A PROPER STANDARDS AROUND THE TIME YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD TAKE TO RECEIVE GOOD QUALITY CRISIS CARE WHICH WE NOW IT ACCEPT THE IDEA OF A WAITING TIME STANDS OF PHYSICAL HEALTH HAS JUST BEEN TAKEN AS READ SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THAT SHOULD CHANGE IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE THEY SHOULDN'T SHOULDN'T BE THE KIND OF LENGTH OF LENGTH OF STAY LENGTH OF TIME OF WAIT FOR GETTING ACCESS TO EATING DISORDER SERVICES OR OR INTAE PEOPLE WITH PSYCHOSIS OR BI POLAR DISORDER RIGHT SO WE'RE TALKING HERE NOT
SO MUCH ABOUT THE CARE OF MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE THE ONGOING CARE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A MENTAL PROBLEM MIGHT PERHAPS DEPRESSION BUT ACUTE CARE AS WELL SOMEBODY HAS BIPOLAR WHICH OBVIOUSLY WELL MANY PEOPLE DIE AS A RESULT OF IT WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MAJOR TRANSFORMATION OF THE WAY IN WHICH WE THINK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE ROUND FROM THOSE PEOPLE WITH WITH SO CALLED MILD TO MODERATE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS LIKE DEPRESSION RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH TO MORE
SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND SITTING UNDERNEATH THIS IS A REAL FOCUS ON JUST CHECK CREATING A MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT APPROACH TO HIS WORKFORCE AND PAYMENTS AND FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE MONEY WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SAT IN A BUNKER REALLY COMPARED TO THE WAY IN WHICH WE THINK ABOUT PHYSICAL HOUSE RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY BRIEFLY THEN THEM THE N.H.S. NOW SAYS YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER BILLION POUNDS THAT TELLS HER HE SAYS WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER BILLION POUNDS OVER THE NEXT WAS ENOUGH
WELL IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GET US TO THE FULL PARITY OF ESTEEM THAT EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT HER ONCE BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD WE THINK THAT IF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE N.H.S. WILL BE ABLE TO HELP AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND ALSO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SO WE'LL HAVE MORE DOCTORS MORE NURSES MORE PLACES IN IN HOSPITALS
YEP ABSOLUTELY DISSONANT NEED REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIONAL WORK FORCE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BUT ALSO AT THE IT'S A DIFFERENT MINDSET IN THE N.H.S. THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS IT'S NOT MONEY IT'S CHANGING ATTITUDES IT'S BOTH
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT WELL I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO IS TO BRING THE IDEA OF MENTAL HEALTH INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF THE N.H.S. AND YOU KNOW YOU TALK A LOT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE N.H.S. IN PROGRAMMES LIKE THIS AND ITS NEED TO BRING TOGETHER THE SKILLS OF THE WORKFORCE IN THIS FABULOUS MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS OUT THERE BUT ALSO BRING TOGETHER THE FUNDING TO HELP THEM DO THEIR JOB THEY NEED TO DO IT WELL BECAUSE I DON'T MAKE THE POINT THAT THAT MONEY ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE ATTITUDES NECESSARILY AS IT
NO AND I BUT I THINK WHAT IS CHANGING ATTITUDES IS THE WAY THAT WE AS A PUBLIC THINK ABOUT IT AND PEOPLE WITH THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES PEOPLE LIKE NATALIE YOU'VE JUST HEARD TALKING AND SPEAKING UP ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS OVERALL SO IN A NUTSHELL
MENTAL HEALTH GIVE US DESCRIBE IN THIRTY SECONDS WHAT MENTAL HEALTH MEANS A HELL OF A BIG QUESTION WELL IN IN THIRTY SECONDS IT'S ABOUT HOW WE THINK ABOUT
ALL OF US THINK ABOUT OUR MENTAL HEALTH IN THE SAME WAY AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR FOR OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WHEN A MENTAL HEALTH DETERIORATES AND BECOMES LESS GOOD THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT KIND OF HELP AND SUPPORT AVAILABLE BOTH FOR US AS INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO THE SUPPORT WE CAN GET FROM FROM THE N.H.S. AND AND WHITE WHITE SURFACES POOR FARMER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

CHRIS LENNON DIFFERENT MONTHS QUIT HE'S QUITE HUMBLE ABOUT THE FAT
HE WAS A CLEANER FOR THE WIND TO GUARD AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS IN THIS BAR
THAT'S HOW HE GOT TO MAYBE BE INTRODUCING BIO PLAYED IN THE STRAP WELL AT THEIR SUPPOSEDLY CLEANING A TOILET DAVID MORGAN IS THE ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER FOR THE WARRINGTON GUARDIAN
WE HAVE SPACE TO MEET THEM ALL TUESDAY WERE GOING TO COME IN FOR A PHOTO
AND THE MEAT BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO JOIN THEM WHEN HE PLAYED THE PYRAMID WHICH IS A SMALL STATE OF MIND
AND THEN FOR IT ALL TO DISTENDED AND SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE SHOCKING AND THEY'VE NOT LEFT GREAT PARTY OF WHERE
IT'S HARD TO SAY AT THIS POINT MY LEGACY WILL BE BUT I THINK THERE'LL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED ESPECIALLY MY ITEM ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON OUTSIDE THE LOUNGE A BAR IN THE CENTRE OF TOWN WHERE SOME OF THE BAND MEMBERS WORKED FRIENDS AND FANS GATHERED
WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING REALLY AND IT'S IT'S JUST NATURAL TO CONGREGATE AROUND WHERE WE HAD SO MANY HAPPY
TIMES WITH THEM AND TO THE LADS USED TO WORK IN THE LOUNGE AND THIS WAS THEIR SORT OF THAT SOCIAL WHOLE GROUND HERE BIG THINGS ARE EXPECTED OF THEM THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE IT IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT THERE'S NOBODY DESERVED IT MORE THAN THESE DID I YOU KNOW
THE ONLY THING THAT OUTSTRIP THEIR TALENT REALLY IS WHAT LOVE
GENTLEMEN THE WORD GENTLEMAN IT'S A WORD YOU DON'T TEND TO USE THESE DAYS THAT OFTEN
ALL OF THEM WERE THEY WERE DOWN TO EARTH SELF DEPRECATING FOR ME
DAFT LOVEABLE THEY JUST WALKED INTO A ROOM IN THE ROOM AT ALL
IT'S IT'S JUST AN ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY HE WASN'T TRUST YOUR NORMAL INDIE MUSIC THAT HAD TALENT
A YEAR DOWN THE LINE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MAKING THE HEADLINES FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS
THE BAND WERE DUE TO PLAY A HOMECOMING GIG IN WARRINGTON IN MARCH NOW THEY'RE FANS OF THE GUNNERS SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BUY THEY ONLY BEACHES MUSIC AND GET THEM A PLACE IN THERE
THAT WAS EMILY THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY ENDED A LEEDS STUDIO THIS MORNING IS NICK BEINGS WHO IS THE BISHOP OF LEEDS GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING JOHN IN THE MIDDLE OF LAST WEEK I GOT BACK FROM A TEN DAY VISIT TO TANZANIA NOT ONLY ARE MY FEET STILL MOVING TO THE RHYTHMS OF THE MUSIC AND THE ENERGY OF THE DANCING IN SCHOOLS AS WELL AS CHURCHES I'VE COME HOME LOOKING DIFFERENTLY AT WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN FAMILIAR
I EXPERIENCE REMINDED ME OF THE LATE GERMAN CHANCELLOR HELMUT SCHMIDT WHO WROTE A BOOK SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND WHICH HE KINDLY OFFERED HIS ADVICE TO ANYONE THINKING OF STANDING FOR ELECTION TO THE GERMAN PONDER STOUT DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT UNLESS YOU SPEAK AT LEAST TO FOREIGN LANGUAGES TO A COMPETENT DEGREE WHY
WELL BECAUSE HE SAYS YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOUR OWN CULTURE UNLESS HE LOOKED THROUGH THE LENS OF ANOTHER CULTURE AND TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING BETTER INHABIT THE LANGUAGE AFTER ALL LANGUAGE GOES DEEP SOMETHING'S CAN'T BE TRANSLATED THEY HAVE TO BE INTUITIVE
I DON'T SPEAK SWAHILI BUT THIS IS PARTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON FOR ME IN TERMS AND HERE NOT EVERYONE SEES THE WORLD ASIDE TO FOR EXAMPLE HOW ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THEIR FIRST MEETING IN A THOUSAND YEARS BETWEEN THE POPE AND THE PATRIARCH OF MOSCOW LAST WEEK SINTOR AN ENGLISH LANDS IT MIGHT LOOK MERELY ODD SEEN THROUGH THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE WHOSE RELIGIOUS MEMORY GOES DEEPER INTO CENTURIES OF DIVISION AND IT WILL RESONATE MORE PROFOUNDLY
OR POLITICALLY WHERE THE RESURGENCE OF PUTIN'S RUSSIA APPEARS THREATENING IN THE WEST BUT HAS A DIFFERENT COMPLEXION WHEN SEEN BY RUSSIANS WHOSE RECENT HISTORY OF COLLAPSE HAS BEEN CRYING OUT FOR RE EMPOWERMENT TENSIONS OVER SYRIA FOR EXAMPLE HAVE TO BE SEEN THROUGH RUSSIAN EYES NOT JUST OUR OWN IF WE ARE TO SEE MORE CLEARLY WHAT IS GOING ON THERE
NONE OF THIS IS NEW LISTENING TO TANZANIANS DESCRIBING THEIR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE AND LOTS I COULDN'T HELP BUT LOOK THROUGH THEIR EYES AT MY OWN AND THIS EXPOSES THE LIMITATIONS OF MY OWN IMAGINATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD EVEN MY WORLD MY MIND WAS BEING CHANGED
THIS IS WHAT'S REFERRED TO IN THE BIBLE AS REPENTANCE THE FREEDOM TO CHANGE ONE'S MIND OR TO PUT IT MORE VISUALLY TO RE GRIND THEIR LANDS BEHIND THE EYES THAT SHAPES THE WAY WE SEE GOT THEIR WORLD AND US
IT'S NO SURPRISE THEN THAT FOR CHRISTIANS THIS PERIOD OF LENT US AND TENDED PARTLY TO CLEAR AWAY THE STUFF THAT STOPS US REPENTING IT CREATES THE SPACE IN WHICH WE CAN ONCE AGAIN IN HUMILITY SUBMIT OUR PERCEPTIONS ARE CONVICTIONS NOT PREJUDICES TO THE SEARCHING EYE OF LOVE AND JUSTICE AND MERCY AND GENEROSITY FOR CHRISTIANS LIKE ME TO HAVE THE COURAGE NOT JUST TO GIVE UP CHOCOLATE FOR A FEW WEEKS BUT TODAY TO LOOK AND SEE DIFFERENTLY THAT WITH WHICH WE HAD BECOME COMFORTABLE OR FAMILIAR
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE BISHOP OF LEEDS THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT BY THE END OF THE WEEK THE WARRING PARTIES IN SYRIA ARE MEANT TO HAVE STOPPED FIGHTING THAT WAS THE DEAL STRUCK IN MUNICH BEFORE THE WEEKEND BUT UNTIL THAT KICKS IN ASSUMING IT DOES THERE'S A RUSH TO CLAIM AS MUCH GROUND AS POSSIBLE TURKEY HAS EVEN OPENED UP A NEW FRONT BOMBING KURDISH FORCES IN NORTHERN ALEPPO
RASMUS TURN TOLD HIS INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT FOR T. V. TWO IN DENMARK HE ARRIVED BACK IN DOUBT DAMASCUS LAST NIGHT HAVING BEEN EMBEDDED WITH THE SYRIAN ARMY AND TRAVELLED WITH THEM TO ALEPPO HE SPOKE TO ME EARLIER AND BEFORE OUR INTERVIEW HE STRESSED HE HAD ONLY SEEN THE WALL FROM ONE SIDE THAT OF THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT
THIS IS RIGHT NOW A TURNING POINT IN THE WAR ENSUED YOU HAVE SEEN A WAR RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY'VE BEEN OR STILL STAND
BETWEEN REBELS AND THE SEWING BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THIS ROOM
GAINING CONTROL OVER HUGE AREAS IN THE NORTHERN SYRIA COULD BE A GAME CHANGER IN THIS WALL YOU TALK ABOUT IT BEING AT THIS MOMENT BEING A GAME CHANGER AT WHAT POINT DO YOU THINK THEY CAN WIN THIS WAR
THEY CAN DO THAT WITH TAKING TO CONTROL OFF THE BIGGEST STUDIO LIPO WHERE I WASN'T OF YESTERDAY HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THAT WILL TAKE THEM FROM WHAT YOU SAW
IT WON'T TAKE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF MONTHS I MEAN WHAT THEY HAVE DONE DURING THE LAST COUPLE OF
WEEKS WITH THE HELP OF THE RUSSIANS HAVE CHECKMATE THE WESTERN WORLD BECAUSE
THERE'S NOTHING ACTUALLY AT THE MOMENT THAT THE WESTERN WORLD CAN DO TO STOP THE STEWARD AND THE RUSSIANS FOR RETAKING ALEPPO BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE RUSSIAN AND I COULD HEAR THAT SLEEPING AT NIGHT
WHICH WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HEARD THE BOMBINGS ALL NIGHT AND I HAD BEEN THEN NIPPLE BEFORE AND I'VE NEVER EVER HEARD S.O. MASSIVE BOMBARDMENT
AFTER ALEPPO NEVER HEARD LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND YOU KNOW WHEN THE RUSSIANS
THEY THEY BOMBED LIKE THAT THE WESTERN WORLD CAN SAY WELL WHAT CAN WE DO WE CAN SEND IN THE U.S. ARMY SHOULD THEY BOMBED THE RUSSIAN AIR FORCE NOT WITH IT WOULD NEVER DO THAT SO IT'S LIKE THEY DO AT THE MOMENT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO
NOBODY'S THERE TO STOP THEM BESIDES THE SO CALLED MODERATE REBELS IN THE AREA OF A LIBERAL M.P. AND THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE I DID YOU GET ANY IDEA OF THE EFFECT OF THAT ON JUST THE WAY PEOPLE LIVE THEIR LIFE IN A LAB
IT'S A HUGE CONTRAST BEING A LIBERAL BECAUSE YOU COLONEL
SITTING IN A RESTAURANT HAVING A GREAT MEAL AND A BOLD ONE KILOMETRES ONE OF MY OWN
FROM WHERE YOU'RE SITTING YOU WILL YOU NO IS THAT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GO THERE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FRONT BUT YOU KNOW AND WHEN YOU HEAR THE BOMBINGS THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FRONT THERE'S NO RESTAURANTS
LET'S OPEN THERE'S NO SCHOOL THAT'S OPENED YOU CANNOT LIVE YOUR LIFE THAT YOU CAN IN THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL AREAS IN THE LIPO PEOPLE LATER OF COURSE FRIGHTENED THE HEAR THE BOMBINGS PEOPLE BEING KILLED AND THERE'S A HUGE CONTRAST WHEN YOU'RE UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL
YOU TALK ABOUT TRAVELLING WITH THE SYRIAN ARMY WITH THE PEOPLE YOU WERE WITH WHERE THEY SYRIANS OR WERE THEY OUT OF FOREIGNERS WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN
HE'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION I MEAN WHEN WE TRAVEL FROM DAMASCUS TO AN AIRPORT WHICH IS ABOUT
EIGHT HOURS' DRIVE WE SAW PEOPLE ON THE GROUND FAILING FROM
SHEER MALICIOUS FROM IRAQ HIZBOLLAH FROM THE IRANIANS EVEN SO RUSSIAN TROOPS ON THE GROUND NOT JUST IN THE AIR BUT THE GROUND SO I MEAN THIS IS NOT A WAR BETWEEN TWO ROOMS ANY MORE
I MEAN THIS LONG TIME AGO NO YOU SEE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HIDING EACH OTHER IN SERIE ACTS I HEARD ABOUT THE RUSSIANS I'VE NEVER SORT A RUSSIAN TROOPS UNDERGROUND BEFORE BUT IT DID THIS TENSE AND DO I KNOW
BECAUSE IT'S OFFICIAL AND THEY TOOK ME DOWN THE TOLD THE MEDIA THAT YOU HAVE EVEN U.S. SPECIAL TROOPS ON THE GROUND AND TO ME STARTING COVERING THIS WALL
FOUR YEARS AGO I COULD NEVER EVER IMAGINE THAT THIS WOULD BE A WALL WHERE YOU HAVE RUSSIAN TROOPS IN THE GROUND YOU HAVE U.S. TROOPS ON THE GROUND FIGHTING ON BOTH PARTS OFF THE OFF THE FRONT
AND LISTENING TO THAT IS SIR TONY BRENTON WHO IS A FORMER BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO MOSCOW A SIR TONY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU WHAT RASMUS TANTO TOLD US IT'S A PRETTY HORRIFYING PICTURE ALTOGETHER I'M SURPRISED THAT HE BELIEVES THERE ARE RUSSIAN TROOPS ON THE GROUND SINCE THE RUSSIANS CLAIMED THAT THEY THEY'RE NOT PUTTING TROOPS ON THE GROUND
AND WE HAVE REAL DOMESTIC POLITICAL PROBLEMS IF THEY STARTED TAKING SPEAK SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF CASUALTIES BUT FOR THE REST THERE'S A REAL PROXY WAR GOING ON THERE WITH LOTS OF IRANIAN AND SYRIAN AND OTHER INVOLVEMENT HE SEEMS TO BE PAINTING THE PICTURE VERY ACCURATELY
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT RUSSIA IS TRYING TO DO HERE PARTICULARLY AT THE MOMENT AND OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS I HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN WHEN HE HAS TALKED ABOUT THE DANGER OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND THAT IS AT THE CENTRE OF WHAT IS DRIVING HIM AT THE MOMENT THEY BELIEVE THAT THE WEST HAS BEEN INCOMPETENT IF NOT MALIGN IN DEALING WITH ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND THEY POINT TO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN IRAQ AND IN LIBYA IN PARTICULAR
THEY'RE DETERMINED THAT THERE WILL NOT BE THE SAME RESULT IN SYRIA AND THEY FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT ISLAMIC EXTREMISM TAKING OVER IN SYRIA IS TO BOLSTER THE ASAD REGIME WHICH IS WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING OBVIOUSLY
THEY'RE QUITE KEEN EVENTUALLY I THINK TO MOVE TO CLOSE CO OPERATION WITH THE WEST TO FINDING A REGIME WHICH IS FRIENDLY TO THEM BUT DOESN'T NECESSARILY INVOLVE A SAD PERSONALLY BUT THAT THEY'RE DETERMINED TO BOLSTER AS SAD AS MUCH AS THEY CAN BEFORE IN PARTICULAR CEASEFIRE TAKES EFFECT WHICH IS AT THE END
THIS WEEK AND I THINK THEY'RE PRETTY PRETTY CLEARLY THEY'RE DETERMINED IN PARTICULAR TO SEAL ALEPPO OFF AS A PRELIMINARY SWEETS FALLING AS A WAY OF MAKING SURE THE SAND IS NOT GOING TO FALL IN THE NEAR FUTURE OH KAY SAID IT WAS THE FACT OF THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES DOESN'T KICK IN FOR A WEEK YOU THINK IS TO ALLOW TIME TO GAIN GROUND
ABSOLUTELY IN THIS THEY'VE DONE THIS BEFORE IF YOU THINK BACK TO THE MINSK TO AGREEMENT IN IN UKRAINE IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR
IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME THING THE RUSSIANS DEMANDED THAT THE AGREEMENT ONLY ENTRANT FORCE AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD AND THEY USE THAT PERIOD TO ACTUALLY SEIZE THE TOWN AT THE BOTS HAVE TO STRENGTHEN THE LINES OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THEIR SIDE BUT WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE TALKING TURKEYS TALKING ABOUT SAUDI ARABIAN TROOPS COMING AND JOINING IT AT ITS INTELLECT AIR BASE AND POSSIBLY GOING IN SENDING IN GROUND TROOPS
YEAH I MEAN I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE MOST DANGEROUS POINT IN ALL OF THIS AT THE MOMENT SEEMS TO ME TO BE THE TURKISH SYRIAN
BORDER AT THE SAUDIS AND I DO NOT NOT SO IMPORTANT REALLY BUT THE TURKS HAVE A REAL NEURALGIA ABOUT THE SYRIAN KURDS TAKING OVER THAT BORDER AND THEN SUPPLYING TURKISH KURDS WITH WEAPONS TO BOLSTER THEIR THEY'RE FIGHTING AGAINST YOU
THEY'RE ALREADY FIRING ACROSS THE BORDER THEY SEEM TO HAVE SENT SOME TROOPS IN WHEN CAN EASILY IMAGINE A MAJOR GROUND INCURSION THERE BY THE TURKS THEN ELEVATING ITSELF INTO A MAJOR CONFRONTATION BETWEEN A NATO I LIKE WHICH IS WHAT TURKEY IS AND RUSSIA SO HOW DO YOU SEE THIS PLAYING OUT PARTICULARLY BETWEEN
AMERICA NATO AND RUSSIA WELL THE RUSSIANS ARE SORT OF COMMITTED TO THE CEASEFIRE
NOBODY REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE CEASEFIRE IS GOING TO TAKE EFFECT BUT THE RUSSIANS ARE VERY KEEN TO WORK WITH THE WEST IN A WAY WHICH ELIMINATES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ISIS FINALLY TAKING OVER SYRIA IT'S A MATTER OF MAKING THAT CO OPERATION WORK DESPITE THE VERY DEEP MISTRUST WHICH EXISTS
GIVEN THEIR VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT RUSSIA AND THE WEST HAS BEEN TAKING SO FAR RASMUS TANNED HELD SO TONY BRENTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT THE WHETHER THOMAS VERY COLD VERY VERY COLD ABSOLUTELY BUT IT'LL BE A NICE CRISP SUNNY DAY TODAY WITH A FEW WINTRY SHOWERS AFFECTING EASTERN AREAS OF THE U.K. ANYWHERE FROM ABERDEENSHIRE THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND LINCOLNSHIRE WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE GET SOME SNOW AS FAR SOUTH AS EAST ANGLIA AND ALSO THE LONDON AIR BUT WHAT I SAY SNOW WAY I'M LITERALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT A FEW FLAKES OF SNOW FALLING OUT OF THE SKY CERTAINLY NO SNOWMAN POTENTIAL TODAY

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE FIFTEENTH OF FEBRUARY THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING H.S.B.C. HAS DECIDED AGAINST MOVING ITS HEADQUARTERS TO HONG KONG AND WILL STAY IN THIS COUNTRY A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN ENGLAND HAS FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED AN AIRLINER HAS BEEN FORCED TO RETURN TO LONDON AFTER THE LASER WAS SHONE INTO THE COCKPIT AND THE FUTURE OF VELLUM WHICH IS BEING USED TO RECORD BRITISH LAWS FOR A THOUSAND YEARS HAS BEEN SECURED
TODAY'S NEWS IS READ BY CATHY GLOWSTONE H.S.B.C. HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S TO KEEP ITS HEADQUARTERS IN THE U.K. AFTER REVIEWING WHETHER TO MOVE TO HONG KONG EUROPE'S BIGGEST BANK LAUNCHED A REVIEW LAST YEAR SIGHTING CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASINGLY TOUGH REGULATION AND A BANKING LEVY INTRODUCED IN BRITAIN AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS H.S.B.C. SAID MAINTAINING ITS HUB IN LONDON OFFERED THE BEST OUTCOME FOR CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS ARE BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JAWLINE UM HAS THE DETAILS
IN A STATEMENT H.S.B.C. SAID IT WAS STAYING FOLLOWING UNANIMOUS VOTE BY THE BOARD BECAUSE THE U.K. WAS AN IMPORTANT AND GLOBALLY CONNECTED ECONOMY THAT INTERNATIONALLY RESPECTED REGULATORY AND LEGAL SYSTEMS THE DECISION WILL COME AS A RELIEF TO THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WHO CALLED FOR A NEW SETTLEMENT WITH BANKS FOLLOWING THE GENERAL ELECTION THAT INCLUDED SCALING BACK THE BANK LEVY WHICH COSTS H.S.B.C. ALMOST A BILLION POUNDS A YEAR AS WELL AS REPLACING THE HEAD OF THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY WHO WAS DISLIKED BY SOME BANKS
ALTHOUGH THE ENVIRONMENT MAY HAVE CHANGED SOMEWHAT IN BRITAIN CHINA'S GROWING INTERFERENCE IN HONG KONG AND THE RISK OF A GLOBAL SLOWDOWN MAY HAVE ALSO PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN KEEPING H.S.B.C. IN LONDON THE BANK SAID IT WOULD ONLY REVIEW WHERE IT IS BASED IN FUTURE IF THERE WERE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S DIDN'T SPECIFY WHETHER THAT WOULD INCLUDE BRITAIN'S VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THE TREASURY HAS WELCOMED ADDRESS P.C.S DECISION THE GROUP'S CHAIRMAN DOUGLAS FLINT TOLD US RECENT CONCESSIONS TO THE CITY HAD BEEN A FACTOR BUT HE DISMISS SUGGESTIONS FOR H.S.B.C. HAD FORCED THE GOVERNMENT'S HAND
I THINK WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS THAT THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE SCOPE OF THE LEFTIE A LEVY BASED ON AN INTERNATIONAL BALANCE SHEETS AN INCIDENT THAT SUCKED INTERNATIONAL BALLET SHOE WAS A DISINCENTIVE FOR A FOR A GLOBAL GROUP AND WE MADE THAT POINT EVER SINCE THE START OF THE LEVEE THE GOVERNOR'S VERY WELL OVER VIEW INDEED THE VIEW OF MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO COMMENTED UPON IT BUT THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO PRESSURE PUT OR AN OR NEGOTIATION
THE MAN WHO HEADED AN INQUIRY INTO THE FUTURE SAFETY OF BRITAIN'S BANKS HAS HAD PLANS DRAWN UP BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH SO JOHN VICKERS WHO LED THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON BANKING SAID BUNK SHOULD HAVE MORE CAPITAL IN RESERVE TO ENABLE THEM TO SURVIVE ANY FUTURE FINANCIAL CRISIS WITHOUT A BILL LIKE FROM THE TAXPAYER THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS DECLINED TO COMMENT A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT TANYA BECKETT REPORTS
A STRONG CAPITAL BASE IS CONSIDERED VITAL TO HER BANK SAFETY HELPING TO PROTECT IT IN THE CASE OF SUDDEN LOSSES THE MOST STABLE IS FUNDING FROM SHAREHOLDERS BUT THIS IS A COSTLY OPTION THE RECENT DROP IN EUROPEAN BANKING STOCKS A FIFTH SINCE THE START OF THIS YEAR THE SPOT CONCERNS ABOUT FRESH TURMOIL IN THE SECTOR
SIR JOHN VICKERS WHO SERVED AS CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND LED AN INQUIRY INTO STABILITY IN THE BANKING SECTOR TOLD THE B.B.C. MORE CAPITAL IS NEEDED ON BANKS' BALANCE SHEETS BECAUSE NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE NATURE OR SCALE OF THE NEXT SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM HE SAYS HE'S CONCERNED THAT HIS PROPOSALS ARE NOW BEING WATERED DOWN BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND I WILL BE SPEAKING TO SIR JOHN VICKERS AFTER THIS BULLETIN

THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS AS WARNING THAT THERE'S BEEN A BIG INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TEENAGE GIRLS DELIBERATELY POISONING THEMSELVES WITH TABLETS OR CHEMICALS AS A FORM OF SELF HARM OR RADIO ONE NEWSBEAT INVESTIGATION HAS FOUND THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER MIGHT BE MUCH HIGHER THAN OFFICIAL FIGURES AS MANY GIRLS DON'T CONSULT A DOCTOR ANNA COLLINSON HAS THE DETAILS

DEPARTMENTS HE POISONED THEMSELVES IN ENGLAND AND WALES FROM APRIL TWENTY FOURTEEN SIR MARCH TWENTY FIFTEEN FIGURES GIVEN TO NEWS BY ENGLAND'S HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE INFORMATION CENTRE AND THE WELSH GOVERNMENT'S SUGGESTS THAT SET UP BY NEARLY A THIRD COMPARED WITH FIVE YEARS EARLIER
THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS SAYS A CHANGE IN HOW HOSPITALS WERE CALLED SELF HARM INFORMATION MAY HAVE HAD AN IMPACT BUT THIS INCREASE IN THE NUMBERS IS VERY REAL AND A SERIOUS CONCERN PARTICULARLY AMONG GIRLS AGED BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN THE B.B.C.'S PANORAMA PROGRAMME HAS UNCOVERED HUNDREDS OF LETTERS THAT SHED LIGHT ON THE LATE POPE JOHN PAUL THE SECOND'S THIRTY YEAR FRIENDSHIP WITH A MARRIED WOMAN
IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE LETTERS HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT VOWS OF CELIBACY WERE BROKEN A RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE WYATT REPORTS
THE POPE WAS WRITING TO A MARRIED WOMAN PROFESSOR AND THE TREES ARE COMMUNE ESCA A FELLOW POLE AND A PHILOSOPHER AND WRITER THEY BECAME CLOSE FOR MORE THAN THREE DECADES THE LETTERS HAVE BEEN HIDDEN AWAY IN THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF POLAND
LOOK JOHN PAUL THE SECOND LET THEIR FRIENDSHIP GROW WRITING GOD GAVE YOU TO ME AND MADE YOU MY VOCATION
THE FUTURE POPE INVITED HER TO JOIN HIM AND OTHERS HOME COUNTRY WALKS SKIING HOLIDAYS AND EVEN CAMPING SHE INVITED THE THEN CARDINAL TO STAY WITH HER FAMILY AT THEIR COUNTRY HOME IN NEW ENGLAND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX
AFTER THE TRIP HIS LETTERS SUGGEST A MAN STRUGGLING TO MAKE SENSE OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP IN CHRISTIAN TERMS ONE FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX SAYS MY DEAR TERESA YOU WRITE ABOUT BEING TORN APART BUT I COULD FIND NO ANSWER TO THESE WORDS
THERE'S NO SUGGESTION THAT THE POPE BROKE ANY VOW OF CELIBACY BUT THE LETTERS SHOW THE HUMAN SIDE OF HER MUCH LOVED POPE DOING ONE OF THE LONELIEST JOBS ON EARTH
AND THERE'LL BE MORE ON THIS STORY ON PANORAMA AT IF THIRTY TONIGHT ON B. B. C. ONE
A CENTURIES OLD TRADITION OF USING VELLUM TO RECORD PARLIAMENTARY LEGISLATION HAS BEEN SAVED IT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THAT VELLUM WAS BEING PHASED OUT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE BUT THE CABINET OFFICE HAS STEPPED IN TO FOOT THE BILL HERE'S NINA WORE HARASSED
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS SOME OF BRITAIN'S MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS INCLUDING THE MAGNA CARTA AND THOUSANDS OF ACTS OF PARLIAMENT HAD BEEN RECORDED ON VELLUM OR PARCHMENT MADE FROM CALFSKIN
THAT TRADITION WAS DUE TO COME TO AN END IN APRIL AFTER THE HOUSE OF LORDS DECIDED USING SPECIAL PAPER INSTEAD WOULD SAVE THE TAXPAYER EIGHTY THOUSAND A YEAR
BUT NOW THE PAYMASTER GENERAL MATT HANCOCK SAYS THE CABINET OFFICE MONEY WILL BE USED TO CONTINUE THE TRADITION HE TOLD THE B.B.C. WHILE THE WORLD AROUND US CONSTANTLY CHANGES WE SHOULD SAFEGUARD SOME OF OUR GREAT TRADITIONS AND NOT LET THE USE OF VELLUM DIE OUT THE CABINET OFFICE SPOKESMAN SAYS THEY'RE NOW INVESTIGATING DIFFERENT WAYS TO COVER THE COST
IN A WAR HURST REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS NOW TEN PAST EIGHT WHEN BANKS GET INTO TROUBLE WE ALL PAY A PRICE THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE GREAT CRASH OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WAS THE FEAR THAT SOME OF THE BIGGEST BANKS IN THE LAND WERE AT RISK WE SHELLED OUT BILLIONS TO SAVE THEM AND THE AFTERSHOCKS ARE STILL BEING FELT BUT AT LEAST WE LEARNED LESSONS FROM WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FAR GREATER ECONOMIC DISASTER
OR DID WE ONE OF THE LEADING FIGURES IN THE BANKING WORLD HAS ONE OF THE FUTURE A LOT OF BANKS IS STILL AT RISK BECAUSE WE DIDN'T NOT FULLY ANYWAY HE'S WITH ME HE'S SIR JOHN BECAUSE HE CHAIRED THE U.K.'S INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON BANKING HE'S NOW PROFESSOR WARDEN OF ALL SOULS COLLEGE OXFORD SIR JOHN WHAT LESSONS SHOULD WE HAVE LEARN
I THINK ONE OF THE VERY BIGGEST LESSONS WAS THAT THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL OF THE BANKS HAD IF YOU LIKE THE BUFFERS TO ABSOLVE THE HEAT THE HUGE SHOCKS THAT HIT THEM THEY JUST WEREN'T REMOTELY UP TO THE JOB SO THERE'S BEEN AN EXERCISE OVER THE YEARS SINCE THE CRISIS TO BUILD UP THOSE BUFFERS MAKE THE SHOCK ABSORBERS BIGGER STRONGER SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE THE NEXT CRISIS WHEN THE SHOCKS HIT NEXT
THERE WILL BE THE SHOCK ABSORPTION IT WON'T SPILL OVER ON TO ALL OF US AS TAXPAYERS AND THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW THICK SHOULD THOSE BUFFERS BE NOW VERY GOOD PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE GLOBALLY NOT AS GOOD AS I THINK IT SHOULD BE BUT REASONABLE PROGRESS AND WHERE WE ARE IN THE U.K. IS THAT THE LAST ALMOST THE LAST JIGSAW PIECE IN THE
PICTURE BANKING REFORM IS HOW BIG THOSE DOMESTIC BUFFERS SHOULD BE FOR A HIGH STREET BANKS AND DIDN'T THE BANK OF ENGLAND SET OUT AT THE END OF LAST MONTH'S TRAINING OTHER JANUARY THE NOTION THAT WE DID NOT
THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE BANKS WOULD INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND I'M BEING A BIT TECHNICAL NOW YOU'LL EXPLAIN RELATIVE TO THE BANK'S EXPOSURES BY ABOUT FIVE PER CENT ANOTHER WAS THE BUFFER WOULD HAVE TO BE THICK AT THE BANK ACKNOWLEDGED EXACTLY SO THE BANK OF ENGLAND THIS IS A LONG AWAITED THING IT'S HOW THE EXTRA BUFFER FOR THE BIG HIGH STREET BANKS HERE
BUT IN MY VIEW WHAT THEY PROPOSED WAS DISAPPOINTING WAS I'M AMBITIOUS AND A THICK THICKER BUFFER WOULD BE A BETTER WAY TO GO IF YOU LIKE IT WOULD GIVE US BETTER INSURANCE BETTER SHOCK ABSORPTION IF MORE LIKELY WHEN THE NEXT CRISIS HITS SO YOU'RE SAYING THEY DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH HOW MUCH FURTHER SHOULD THEY HAVE GONE THE BANK OF ENGLAND THAT IS
ON THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON BANKING WHICH I I CHAIRED WHICH FINISHED ITS WORK FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO WE RECOMMENDED A MUCH THICKER ADD ON RELATIVE TO A GLOBAL STANDARD OF SEVEN OR EIGHT PER CENT I COULD TALK ABOUT THE UNITS WE WANTED A THREE PER CENT THREE POINTS ON TOP OF SEVEN ADD ON WHAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS PROPOSING IS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THAT HALF OF IT
ABOUT YOU AND AWAY ABOUT HALF OF IT IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE IT INTERACTS WITH THE THE BUFFERS THAT SOME OF OUR BANKS HAVE FOR GLOBAL REASONS BUT WE WOULD HAVE GONE CONSIDERABLY FURTHER AND MY FEELING IS HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT COMMISSION
IF YOU SEE A PROPOSAL WHICH IS OUT FOR CONSULTATION NOT A DECISION YET IF YOU FEEL IT'S NOT ENOUGH I THINK YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT YOUR HAND UP AND SAY LOOK THIS SHOULD BE DEBATED WHAT ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARGUE THAT
THE BIGGER THE BUFFER THE MORE MONEY THE BANKS HAVE AS IT WERE TO PUT ASIDE FOR FOR THIS BUFFER THE LESS THEY HAVE TO LEND TO BUSINESSES AND THE LICHEN THEREFORE THE SLOWER THE ECONOMY GROWS I THINK I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT AT ALL THIS THIS BUFFET ISN'T PUT ASIDE IT'S PART OF THE FUNDING STRUCTURE OF THE BANK THAT THE MORE EQUITY IN THE BANK THE MORE ONUS CAPITAL IN THE BANK
THE SENSE YOU CAN DO MORE LENDING THERE NEEDS TO BE A LIMIT ON THE RATIO YOU DON'T WANT THE EXPOSURES TO BE TOO BIG A MULTIPLE OF THE THE BUFFER IN THE BANK AND IN A WAY IT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY HOW LARGE MULTIPLE IS STILL ALLOWED BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE ENEMY OF CREDIT AND LANDING I THINK IT'S THE FRIEND THESE THINGS GO TOGETHER WE WANT
WELL CAPITALISED BANKS IF WE DON'T YOU CAN GET INTO A VICIOUS SPIRAL WHERE THE LENDING ALL SEIZES UP SO THE COST OF THESE CRISIS IS NOT JUST ALL THE TAXPAYER BAILOUT BUT IT MESSES UP THE ECONOMY FOR YEARS TO COME BECAUSE THE BANKS JUST AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO DO THE LANDING I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE STRONG ENOUGH AND IF THERE'S NO DOWNSIDE TO IT AND A HUGE UPSIDE AS YOU'RE JUST DESCRIBING WHY DON'T THEY DO IT THEN AND WHITE HAS THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAID LET'S GO WITH IT
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TRUE TO SAY THIS IS COMPLETELY FREE INSURANCE ANY INSURANCE YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PREMIUM AND WATER IS A PREMIUM IN THIS CLOSE I THINK IT'S PRETTY LOW WE'RE STARTING FROM SUCH A LOW BASE THAT THE FRACTION OF THE OWNER'S EQUITY RELATIVE TO THE BANK EXPOSURES EVEN NOW IT COULD BE A MULTIPLE OF THIRTY TIMES A VERY LOW BASE I WOULD SAY THE COST
BEEFING THIS UP HAVING A SICK A CUSHION A REALLY VERY VERY LOW COMPARED WITH THE BENEFITS WHICH IS BETTER INSURANCE AGAINST THIS ECONOMIC DISASTER SO WHAT'S HOLDING THE BANK OF ENGLAND BACK THEN ARE THEY SCARED OF THE BANKS OR WHAT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THEY OVER THE REST OF WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS THEY'VE DONE STRESS TEST THEY DONE ECONOMIC MODEL YACHT RIGOUROUS ENOUGH THOSE DRESSED
SOME WOULD SAY I THINK I THINK STRESS TESTS ARE GOOD WHAT THEY DON'T HELP YOU WITH A THE THE UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS COS YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T ANTICIPATE THOSE YOU CAN'T PUT THEM INTO THE TEST AND IT CAN BE THOSE THAT WHACK YOU AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT HAVING A THICK BUFFER OF THIS SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY CAPITAL IS WHEREVER THE SHOCK COMES FROM EVEN IF IT NEVER CROSSED YOUR MIND BEFOREHAND
THE SHOCK WILL BE ABSORBED BY EQUITY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SICK ENOUGH LAYER THEN WELL THEN IT'S PLAN B. AND THEN YOU CAN BE IN BIG TROUBLE BIG TROUBLE MEANS THE SORT OF THING THAT HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
IN EXTREMIS IT WOULD NOW A LOT OF OTHER MEASURES ARE NOW IN PLACE INCLUDING WE'RE ON TRACK TO DO THE STRUCTURAL REFORM OF RING FENCING WHICH I BELIEVED TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND I SEE THESE CAPITAL BUFFERS INDEED GOING VELMA TALKED OF ANYTHING SEEM WE MEAN VENTURE RISK CAPITAL IS IT WORD OR WHAT IS IT WE'RE ALL AS OPPOSED TO THE BANKS WHO ARE INVESTING TO MAKE LOADS OF MONEY ON THEIR GAMBLING IN ONE SENSE I KNOW YOU WERE BUT YOU WERE GAMBLING BUT NONETHELESS THAT'S MODEL OF PEOPLE SEE IT IN THAT
AND NORMAL HIGH STREET BUSINESS IGS IGS YOU PUT A HOT YOU PROTECT THE NORMAL HIGH STREET BUSINESS THAT EVERYBODY LISTENING DEPENDS ON VITAL SERVICES THERE YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT BIT OF A BANKING GROUP DOING THE RIVET OF TRADING COMMODITY TRADING FANS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD AND SO ON SO YOU YOU PROTECT IT STRUCTURALLY AND YOU WANT A GOOD THICK
BUFFER PROTECTING IT BECAUSE IF THAT BIT FALLS OVER THE HIGH STREET BIT FALLS OVER THEN WE'RE IN REAL REAL TROUBLE AND IS THAT BUFFER THICKENER
THAT'S THE BATH I WOULD LIKE TO BE THICKER THAN THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS PROPOSING IT IT IS OUT FOR CONSULTATION THERE'S NO FINAL DECISION ON THIS I HOPE THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL RECONSIDER IT MIGHT WANT TO REFLECT ON THE TURMOIL WE'VE SEEN IN BANKING SHARES POLITICALLY SOME CONTINENTAL EUROPEAN BANKING SHARES AND IN RECENT WEEKS SINCE THEY FIRST SET OUT THIS FRAMEWORK THERE WAS A BROAD FRAME OUT THEY SET OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER
I THINK THEY SHOULD REFLECT ON THE LESSONS OF THAT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE LESS OPTIMISTIC THAN THEIR DOCUMENTS SUGGEST ABOUT THE ABILITY OF SOME THESE NEW SPECIAL BANK DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ABSORB LOSS
I THINK THEY SHOULD RECALIBRATE DO SOMETHING STRONGER WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST WEEKS MONTHS EVEN IS A COLLAPSE IN BANKING SHARES MOSTLY IN EUROPE BUT IN THIS COUNTRY AS WELL IS THIS CONNECTED TO YOUR FEARS
YES AND WITH THAT THE PROPOSALS AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS NOW CONSULTING ON THEREFORE THE MEDIUM TERM WHERE ARE WE TRYING TO GET TO IN TWO OR THREE YEARS' TIME THEY'RE NOT ABOUT THIS WE CALL THIS MONTH BUT THE TURMOIL WE HAVE SEEN IN THE MARKETS WITH THIS TREMENDOUS VOLATILITY AND DOWNWARD TREND NOT ONLY IN THE SHARES BUT ALSO SOME OF THE THE DERIVATIVES THE BONDS IT IT IS QUITE CONCERNING SOME DAYS I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT
LESSON THAT YOU HAVE TO GET THE BASICS RIGHT YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE BASIC STRONG AND THAT'S WHY MY HOPE IS THAT REFLECTING ON THIS CONSULTATION EXERCISE THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL GO STRONGER WE'LL GO FIRMER AND IF IT DOESN'T SHOULD WE BE WORRIED
SERIOUSLY WORRIED ABOUT A BANK OF ENGLAND AND IF A EUBANK GOES UNDER ALL BETS ARE OFF AREN'T THEY WERE IN DANGEROUS TO VERY DANGEROUS TERRITORY THIS IS ALL ABOUT MATTERS OF DEGREE IT'S HOW FAR DO YOU GO HOW FALL AN INSURANCE POLICY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE I WOULD GO FOR A STRONGER ONE A FIRMER ONE VAN IN THE CURRENT BANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSAL I'M NOT PREDICTING ARMAGEDDON
AT ALL BUT THIS SEEMS TO ME BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPORTANCE OF AVOIDING THESE CRISES TO EVERYBODY THAT WE NEED A THICK A BUFFER AND I WOULD GO
SIGNIFICANTLY FURTHER THAN THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS CURRENTLY PROPOSING AND YOU WERE NOT PREDICTING ARMAGEDDON BUT YOU ARE SAYING THAT IF WE DON'T DO THIS
AND YOU BASTE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ON A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT YOU DID AS A RESULT OF THE CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT YOU ARE SETTING THAT BANKS MIGHT BE AT RISK
YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THE HISTORY A SPANX WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE IS AN EVER PRESENT RISK I WOULD LIKE TO CONTAIN THAT ABSOLUTELY TO THE MINIMUM
EXTRA EQUITY CAPITAL I THINK IS VERY CLOSE TO FREE IT'S NOT COMPLETELY FREE BUT I WOULD SEE THAT AS A PRIZE WELL WORTH PAYING FOR EXTRA INSURANCE EXTRA SHOCK ABSORPTION FOR THE FUTURE
SO JOHN BECAUSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU THE TIME IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT IF SOMEONE TAKES AN INDECENT PICTURE OF A CHILD AND SENDS IT TO SOMEONE ELSE IT IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE NO SURPRISE
BUT WHAT IF THEY'RE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN AND THE PICTURE THEY TAKE IS OF THEMSELF AND THE PERSON THEY SEND IT TO IS THEIR GIRLFRIEND OR BOYFRIEND SHOULD THEY THEN BE RECORDED ON THE POLICE DATABASE A RECORD THAT COULD STOP THEM WORKING WITH CHILDREN WHEN THEY LEAVE SCHOOL
THE POLICE ARE DRAWING UP NEW GUIDELINES TO STOP SO MANY CHILDREN BEING CRIMINALISED THE SUNDAY TIMES REPORTED YESTERDAY THAT A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST SHOWED ONE THOUSAND UNDER EIGHTEENS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED BY THE POLICE FOR SEXTING AS IT'S KNOWN SINCE TWENTY TWELVE
IN SEPTEMBER WE HEARD FROM A WOMAN WHOSE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SON NOW HAS HIS NAME ON THE POLICE DATABASE FOR THE CRIME OF MAKING AND DISTRIBUTING INDECENT IMAGES OF A SUP CHILD BECAUSE HE SENT A NAKED PICTURE OF HIMSELF TO A GIRL IN HIS YEAR AT SCHOOL NEARLY SIX MONTHS ON I SPOKE TO HIS MOTHER AGAIN AND ASKED WHETHER THEIR EXPERIENCE HAD MADE HER AWARE OF THE SAME THING HAPPENING TO OTHERS
TO BE FAIR UNTIL THE EVENING OF THIS INCIDENT HAPPENING IN SCHOOL I HADN'T EVEN HEARD OF SNAP CHAT LET ALONE SEXTING SO I'VE HAD TO RUN TO CATCH UP SHALL WE SAY
I NEED TOTALLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AMONGST MY FRIENDS PEER GROUPS AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING I SUPPOSE SEXUALISED SOONER I THINK IT'S JUST BECAUSE IT'S VERY COMMON PLACE I'M NOT SAYING ALL CHILDREN TO READ BUT I THINK MOST CHILDREN KNOW A CHILD WHO HATLESS
HOW'S YOUR SUNBEDS SINCE IT'S ALL WENT PUBLIC HE WAS VERY HUMILIATED AT THE TIME FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THERE ARE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WITHIN SCHOOL HE'LL STILL TAUNT HIM TODAY THAT THEY HAVE THAT PICTURE THEY PROBABLY DON'T BUT SOMETHING HE'LL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED FOR AND I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THAT CERTAINLY NOT
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS SITUATION ARE TREATED
TO BE FAIR I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE HOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER IT'S A CRIMINAL ACT TO DO THIS IF CHILDREN ARE DOING IT THEY ARE LEAVING THEMSELVES VULNERABLE ONCE THEIR IMAGES OUT THERE IT'S OUT THERE
ONE OF MY CONCERNS WAS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S AN IMAGE OF MY SON SOMEWHERE IT'S NOT JUST A FOURTEEN FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO'S LOOKING AT IT IT COULD BE A PAEDOPHILE WHO'S LOOKING AT IT
THAT'S THE BIT THAT MAKES ME WORRIED AND I THINK THERE ARE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO BE EDUCATED SO THEY DON'T DO THIS YOU KNOW AND IF IT COMES TO THE ATTENTION OF SCHOOLS AND AUTHORITIES I THINK IT'S MORE THE PLACE HAVE YOU NO
CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE SERVICES YOUTH WORKERS IT'S ABOUT EDUCATING CHILDREN ABOUT WHY IT'S INAPPROPRIATE NON CRIMINALISING THEM BUT THE POLICE ARE UPDATING THE GUIDANCE THEY GIVE TO SCHOOLS THERE MUST BE SOME TIMES WHEN IT'S RIGHT TO GET THE POLICE INVOLVED
I SHOULD IMAGINE SO I DON'T BELIEVE SO MY SON'S CASE BUT I CAN PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND THAT FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IF A CHILD HAS AN IMAGE OF ANOTHER CHILD AND THEN USES THAT IMAGE TO BULLY THAT PERSON OR DISTRIBUTES IN KNOWING IT'S GOING TO GET INTO THE WRONG HANDS
BUT THERE'S I SUPPOSE THERE'S CRATES OF OFFENDING SO TO SPEAK YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL CATEGORY AS SEEMS TO HAPPEN AT THE MOMENT
DOES YOUR SON STILL USE SNAP CHAT AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA AT ONLINE YES HE DOES WE'VE HAD A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE IN WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND WHAT'S INAPPROPRIATE I'VE HAD TO GET UP TO SPEED VERY QUICKLY ON THAT BUT MY SONS OF THE GENERATION THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS JUST THE WAY THEY COMMUNICATE AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO OTHER PARENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD KNOW ABOUT WHAT THEIR CHILDREN
I SUPPOSE IT'S JUST ABOUT OPENING THEIR LINES OF COMMUNICATION I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH MY SON AND I WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO HIM AND IT OPENED UP A WHOLE AVENUE OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD IN ANY EVENT
SOME CHILDREN DON'T HAVE THAT SAME RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR PARENTS I DIDN'T MAKE MY SON FEEL DIRTIER ANYTHING IT ISN'T ABNORMAL TO BE CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR BODY I JUST THINK IT'S QUITE SAD REALLY THAT WE'RE EVEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY PRIVATE MATTER BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE GOOD OF THE SAME AGE IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED THAT'S BROUGHT IT TO MY ATTENTION BROUGHT IT TO THE SCHOOL'S ATTENTION AND I SUPPOSE TO THE WIDER SCHOOL POPULATION
THAT WAS THE MUM OF A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WHO GOT CAUGHT UP IN SEXTING AND I SPOKE TO EARLIER AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY AND HER WORDS WERE RE VOICED BY ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS AND JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY ALAN WARDLE WHO'S HEAD OF POLICY AT THE ENNIS P. C. C. A GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WE SHOULD PROMISE I MEAN THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY WIDESPREAD IT'S PROBABLY HAPPENING IN EVERY SCHOOL IN THE COUNTRY
IT IS NOT EVERY CHILD IS DOING IT I THINK WE SHOULD BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT IT'S PROBABLY A MINORITY THE STUDIES VARY SOME SAY IT'S LEWIS TEN TWELVE PERCENT OF THE SHOPS BUT FORTY FIFTY PER CENT OR DEPENDS BUT CLEARLY IT WAS AN ISSUE AND IT IS HOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LIVING THEIR LIVES AND HOW THEY ARE
EXPRESSING HER SEXUALITY EXPLORING THEIR BODIES IN A LOT OF WAYS AND WE HAVE TO SORT OF DEAL WITH THE RELATIVES AND THE REALITY MEANS THAT WE CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE DEAL WITH IT THAT THEY'D POLICE GUIDELINES SHOULD CHANGE QUITE DRAMATICALLY FROM NOW BUT WHAT PUT THE CASE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT TECHNICALLY A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOY SENDING A PICTURE OF HIMSELF TO HIS FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLFRIEND OR VICE VERSA
TECHNICALLY THAT IS DISTRIBUTING AN INDECENT IMAGE OF A CHILD WHICH IS AS A TERRIBLE THING BUT ACTUALLY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BE DOING IS NECESSARILY CRIMINALISING FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SENDING PICTURES OF THEMSELVES IN A CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP SO THAT'S WHY HE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED REALLY AND IT'S GOOD THAT THE POLICE ARE LOOKING AT THIS PIECE YOU SEE WITH UPDATING GUIDANCE FOR SCHOOLS AS WELL SO IT IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT BUT HOW DO YOU GET THE BALANCE RIGHT BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU
THERE'S PARTLY THEY'RE SENDING A MESSAGE BUT ALSO I MEAN IT IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE TO SEND A PICTURE OF JOHN YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THEM THE BALANCE RIGHT IS TO WET WET WHEN YOU REFER IT TO THE POLICE PRISON ABSOLUTELY AND SCHOOLS AND POLICE NEED TO ASSESS THE RISK ESSENTIALLY SO KISSES FOR INSTANCE OF THERE'S BEEN QUESTION CHILDREN ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO DO IT WHICH WE KNOW AS IT CAN BE A REAL ISSUE IF SAY THE IMAGE HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED QUITE WIDELY AGAINST THE CHILD'S CONSENT WHICH WAS VERY DISTRESSING TO THE AH FACTOR IS THAT THE POLICE IN THE SCHOOL CAN LOOK TO SEE HOW
HER RISK IT AND WHETHER THERE IS A DANGER AND WHETHER IT SHOULD BE REPORTED TO POLICE WE WOULD SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO BE DOING THAT JENNA LAME IN THE POLICE HAVE ENOUGH TO BE GETTING ON WITH AND IT SHOULD TRY TO BE CONTAINED
THE SCHOOL WITHIN FAMILIES AND YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO BE EDUCATED BUT THE RISKS ABOUT HER BECAUSE THESE IMAGES KANGOL WIDESPREAD AND IN TERMS OF HOW THE POLICE DEAL WITH IT PRESUMABLY THERE SHOULD BE SOME OPTIONS FOR THEM WHERE PERHAPS THE CHILD'S NAME DOESN'T NEED TO END UP ON THE POLICE DATABASE HAS HAPPENED WITH THIS YOUNG LAD WHEN HE WASN'T EVEN CHART ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THE NEW GUIDANCE FOR THE POLICE ARE PROPOSING THAT THERE IT WON'T BE RECORDED IN A CHILD'S RECORD WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY ARE GOING TO UNIVERSITY FOR JOBS THEY DON'T WANT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU'RE FOURTEEN HUNDRED A LOT YOUNGER TO BE
HUNTING THEM FOR YEARS TO COME SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE POLICE RECORD THESE INCIDENTS BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRAVELLING WITH THE CHILD THROUGH I THINK AS HE GREW UP JUST BRIEFLY DO YOU THINK WE CAN STOP IT I MEAN BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE IMAGES END UP IN THE WRONG HAT WITH THE DO AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT THE NEED TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT THE RISKS OF THIS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE IMPULSE OF THE NOTE WE KNOW THAT BUT THE
IMAGES CAN END UP IN THE WRONG HANDS IT CAN BE ON THE INTERNET AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WITH ITS PARENTS OR SCHOOLS EDUCATING CHILDREN ABOUT THE RISKS OF THIS AND HOW TO EXPRESS HER SEXUALITY CONFIDENTLY ALLA MODEL THANKS VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND HERE'S ROBERT THE SPORT THANKS JOHN HELLO AGAIN SO THE PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE RAISES INTENSIFIED HASN'T IT LEICESTER CITY THE ROMANTICS CHOICE MIGHT HAVE BEEN EIGHT POINTS CLEAR OF ARSENAL AND FIVE CLEAR OF TOTTENHAM THIS MORNING BUT INSTEAD THEIR LEAD OVER BOTH HAS BEEN CUT TO THE FOLLOWING THEIR OWN TWO UNDEFEATED ARSENAL AND SPURS WIN AT MANCHESTER CITY BY THE SAME SCORE ARSENAL GOALKEEPER PEDER CHEQUE HAS BEEN DOING HIS SUMS TOO
IF YOU HAVE A CUSHION OF FIVE POINTS THEN THAT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE IN ORDER LAST FORTY FIVE MINUTES OVERTIME A CUP TO TWO POINTS SO IT'S A BIG A BIG SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE
THE TOP ONE'S WING CAME THANKS TO A LATE GOAL FROM CHRISTIAN ERIKSSON THAT FOLLOWED A CONTROVERSIAL PENALTY AWARDED FOR HANDBALL AGAINST CITIES RHYMES STIRLING WHO HAD HIS BACK TURNED WHEN THE BALL STRUCK HIM MAYBE ON THE ELBOW BUT MAYBE NOT A HURRICANE CONVERTED THE PENALTY FORMER SPURS DEFENDER GARY MAD IT'S ON THE LINE WHAT A GARY TO WORRY ROBERT CITY PROTESTED LONG AND HARD ABOUT THAT HAMBLEDON THERE YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT I THINK THAT ON THIS OCCASION TOP I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT LUCKY
IT WAS A VERY HARSH DECISION HE JUMPED HE'S TURNED HIS BACK THE BOOK THE BALL IS HIT HIM ON THE BACK OR ON THE ELBOW BUT HE SOMETIMES YOU NEED THAT LITTLE BIT OF LUCK LINDA OBVIOUSLY YOU SAY HE WAS GOING OUR WAY YOU MUST HAVE HAD A HAMBLE DECISION OR TWO AGAINST YOU THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS UNJUSTLY WHAT TIME DOES THE HANDBALL OR NOW NEED CLARIFICATION DO YOU THINK
I THINK SO I MEAN IS OR USED TO BE HANDS TO BAUZA THE BALL'S GOING PAST YOU PUT YOUR HAND OUT TO STOP THE BALL AND THE BALL IS BLASTED AT YOU FROM A MEETS A METRE AWAY AND HITS YOU ON THE ARMOUR A PENALTY CAN BE GIVEN SO YES I THINK IT'S IT HAS TO BE SORTED OUT BECAUSE IT CAN BE VERY HARSH AS IT WAS YES FOR MAN CITY SO IF YOU WERE A LAW MAKER WHAT WOULD YOU DO HOW WOULD YOU HOW WOULD YOU CLARIFY
I THOUGHT I THINK THE HANDBALL SITUATION WHERE YOU PUT YOUR HAND OUT OR YOU'RE THROWING ARMS OUT WIDE AND HIS BOOK IS BLOCKING A SHOT I THINK THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH WHEN YOUR ARMS ARE CLOSE TO YOUR SIDE IN A NATURAL POSITION AND THE BALL HITS YOU I THINK THAT'S VERY UNFAIR ESPECIALLY IF YOUR BACK'S TURNED THEY'RE ANYWAY EVA MOORE SAY ANYWAY SPURS TWO POINTS FROM LEICESTER'S LEADERS IT'S THE FIRST MORNING OF THE SEASON THAT YOU REGARDED TOTTENHAM AS GENUINE TITLE CONTENDER
I THINK THAT PERFORMANCE YESTERDAY I THINK THE SPIRIT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONFERENCE AT THE PLAYERS SHOWN I THINK THAT SENT OUT A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT WE ARE SERIOUS TITLE CONTENDERS THE SEASON SPURS AGAINST ARSENAL MATCH THE FIFTH ALWAYS A BIT OF A TASTY FIXED TO THE NORTH LONDON DERBY BUT AS WAS COME EARLY MAY IT MIGHT TURN OUT TO HAVE BEEN ENTITLED ASIDE
THE WAY THINGS HAVE GONE THIS SEASON I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY EXCITING VERY INTERESTING I THINK SUDDENLY ALL THE TEENS ALL THE USUAL SUSPECTS YOU EXPECT TO BE FIGHTING FOR THE TITLE HAVEN'T STEPPED UP TO THE MARK AND YOU KNOW HAVE TOTTENHAM AND ARSENAL AT THE TOP THREE WHO ARE GETTING A SLIGHT GAP ON THE FOURTH PLACE NOW
AND WHO ARE FIGHTING OUT BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND AS I SAY IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY TIGHT FOR EVERY CLEVER THE TOP THERE EVERY POINT NOW IS GOING TO BE LIKE GOLD DUST SO IT'S GONNA LOOK A CUP FINAL FOR EVERY SINGLE TEAM EVERY GAME THEY PLAY REST THE SEASON NOW AND A FINAL THOUGHT CARRIE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE ARE SEASONAL AND LEICESTER FANS DO YOU REGARD LESTER IS YOUR SECOND FAVOURITE TEAM
OF COURSE I THINK I THINK IT'S BEEN GREAT FOR THE PREMIERSHIP EVERYONE'S BEEN SAYING SINCE PROBABLY THE SECOND MONTH OF THE SEASON THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FALL AWAY THEY CAN'T CONTINUE WITH THIS FORM AND YET THEY KEEP ON MAINTAINING FANTASTIC PERFORMANCES THE CARRIAGE THEY SHOWED YESTERDAY EVEN OF YOU GOING DOWN TO TEN MEN THIS SEASON I THINK I'VE BEEN VERY SURPRISED AT THEIR PERFORMANCES BUT YOU SAY WE'RE ALL ENJOYING IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TONIGHT LET'S HAVE SOME OF THE NEWS CATHY CLAXTON IS HERE H.S.B.C. SAYS IT'S KEEPING ITS HEADQUARTERS IN LONDON AFTER CONSIDERING A MOVE TO HONG KONG EUROPE'S BIGGEST BANK LAUNCHED A REVIEW LAST YEAR SIGHTING CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASINGLY TOUGH REGULATION AND A BANKING LEVY INTRODUCED FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS
THE MAN CHARGED WITH HEADING AN INQUIRY INTO THE FUTURE SAFETY OF BRITAIN'S BANKS HAS A BANK OF ENGLAND PLANS ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH SO JOHN VICKERS WHO LED THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON BANKING TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT PROPOSALS ON HOW MUCH CAPITAL BANK SHOULD HAVE IN RESERVE WE DISAPPOINTING AND UNAMBITIOUS AND A THICKER BUFFER WAS A BETTER WAY TO GO
A REVIEW OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ENGLAND HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE N.H.S. IS FAILING MOST PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS THE REVIEW COMMISSIONED BY N.H.S. ENGLAND SAID PATIENTS WERE NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEEDED DUE TO CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED SERVICES MINISTERS HAVE COMMITTED TO INCREASE SPENDING AND A VIRGIN ATLANTIC AIRLINER TRAVELLING TO NEW YORK WAS FORCED TO RETURN TO LONDON LAST NIGHT WHEN THE LASER WAS SHONE AT THE COCKPIT THE AIRCRAFT HAD JUST TAKEN OFF WHEN THE CREW WAS TARGETED
IT IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE WHEN FOREIGN MINISTER'S ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THAT THEY HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT ON A CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF SCEPTICISM THAT WOULD ACTUALLY STOP THE FIGHTING THERE STILL IS WHAT IS NOT IN DOUBT IS THAT DEGREE OF SUFFERING ON THE GROUND AS A DESPERATE NEED FOR MUCH MORE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF INCREASES RATHER THAN DIMINISH AS WELL I'M GOING ON THE LINE
BY BARONESS AMOS WHO WAS UNITED NATIONS AND THE SECRETARY GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS AND EMERGENCY RELIEF GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING I SAID INCREASING WHAT HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU NOW ESTIMATE IF IT'S POSSIBLE EVEN TO HAVE A REALISTIC ESTIMATE I NEED HELP
WILL BE KNIGHTED ASIANS ESTIMATE IS THAT THERE ARE ABOUT THIRTEEN AND A HALF BILLION PEOPLE INSIDE SYRIA WHO ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF HELP
WHAT IS EVEN MORE STAGGERING IS THAT FOUR AND A HALF MILLION OF THEM ARE IN PARTS OF SYRIA WHICH ARE VERY VERY HARD TO REACH OR INDEED THAT THEY CANNOT REACH AT ALL THESE FIGURES ARE SO STAGGERING THAT I PEEP THINK PEOPLE HAVE JUST LOST TRACK OF THEM AND OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN THE NEARLY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE FLED THE COUNTRY
INTO NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES AND I'M NOW FINDING THEIR WAY TO EUROPE IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE SITUATION AND THE THING THAT REALLY REALLY CONCERNS ME JOHN IS THAT WE'VE WATCHED THIS HAPPEN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAVE WATCHED THIS HAPPEN HOW COULD WE HAVE STOPPED IT
WELL WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND OF COURSE WE ARE WHERE WE ARE THERE'S NO POINT LOOKING BACK AT THOSE POINTS WHERE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO STOP IT BUT
THE COMMITMENT TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION HAS GOT TO BE MUCH STRONGER YES WE GOT THE DEAL LAST WEEK IT'S A DEAL THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE ANY OF THE SYRIAN PARTIES THERE'S NO COMMITMENT FROM THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THEY SAY BOMBING ISIS TO STOP ON THE CONIFERS THEY ARE CONTINUING
THEY'RE CONTINUING WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS TURKEY BOMBING IN SYRIA BECAUSE THEY ARE BOMBING KURDISH FORCES I MEAN THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND IS JUST APPALLING AND THESE ARE COUNTRIES THAT COME TOGETHER AND SAY THAT THE FIGHTING HAS TO STOP OF COURSE IT HAS TO STOP IT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP AND HUMANITARIAN AID IS BEING USED AS IT WERE AS A KIND OF A POSTAGE STAMP TO TRY AND STOP WHAT IS HE SENT CHILLI
A POLITICAL SITUATION UNRAVELLING OR INDEED WHICH HAS UNRAVELLED BEFORE OUR VERY EYES THE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN AID IS NOT THE ANSWER AND INDEED THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISM THAT BY DELIVERING HUMANITARIAN AID BY TALKING TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT BY TALKING
TO ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS THAT SOMEHOW THE UNITED NATIONS IS CULPABLE THAT'S THEIR JOB THEIR JOB IS TO TRY AND STOP THE SUFFERING ON THE GROUND BUT THEY CAN'T FIX IT AND THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISM OF WESTERN FOREIGN POLICY
WHICH SHOULD THEY SAY THE CRITICS SAY
SIMPLY TO ACCEPT THAT THERE IS NO WAY ESPECIALLY NOW THAT RUSSIAN IS ON HIS SIDE IN THE WAY THAT IT IS THAT IS NO WAY THAT ASSET CAN BE DEFEATED AND THEREFORE
WE HAVE TO STOP SUPPORTING THOSE ARE GIVING SUPPORT OF ALL SORTS TO THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSING HIM AND THAT WAY IT MAY BE UNPALATABLE BUT AT LEAST THE WAR MIGHT THEN COME TO AN END A LITTLE MORE QUICKLY THAN OTHERWISE
I THINK THAT EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS HAS CALLED TO ACCEPT THAT THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT RUSSIA HERE
IT'S ABOUT ALL OF THOSE PARTIES THAT ARE ENGAGED AS IT WERE IN A KIND OF PROXY WAR INSIDE SIMILAR THEY HAVE ALL GOT TO ACCEPT THAT AND THE REALITY IS THAT THEY DO NOT AND THAT'S WHY THE FIGHTING CONTINUES EVERYBODY'S JOCKEYING FOR POSITION JOCKEYING SO THAT THOSE THEY SUPPORT CAN HAVE A STRONGER HAND WHEN THEY COME TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE
WE ALL KNOW THAT DIPLOMACY IS AN IMPERFECT WAY FOR THINGS TO BE RESOLVED BECAUSE YOU VERY OFTEN HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH UNPALATABLE PEOPLE BUT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHAT DIPLOMACY AND NEGOTIATION IS ABOUT A YEAR ON YEAR WHAT WE HAVE SEEN A
DIFFERENT TO POWERS TAKING SOMETIMES INTRACTABLE POSITIONS WHICH HAD MEANT
THAT THAT SOLUTION IS RECEDING AND RECEDING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY AND WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST WE CAN LOOK AT HISTORY AND WE'VE SEEN CONFLICTS THAT HAVE GONE ON FOR DECADES
THIS IS FIVE YEARS NOW WHAT THOSE OF US INVOLVED IN LOOKING AT THIS SITUATION UNRAVEL FEAR IS THAT THIS COULD BE GOING ON FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS ANOTHER TEN YEARS ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS
IF SIGNIFICANT ACTION IS NOT TAKEN RIGHT

TO SUDDENLY BE IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AND TELL THE KIND OF STORIES THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TELL HE MIGHT NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO TELL OTHERWISE SO I YOU LURED BY THE GLAMOROUS NO THIS IS THE TIME TO UP STICKS AGAIN MOVER NO DEFINITELY NOT ALL MY FAMILY'S IN LONDON AND I LOVE I LOVE WORKING IN THE BUSINESS IN LONDON IT'S BEEN BRILLIANT TO ME AND ALSO I LOVE I LOVE THE ABILITY THAT YOU HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY TO TO NOT SHE YOU CAN YOU CAN WORK ON PLAYS YOU CAN WORK ON T. V. CAN WORK ON MOVIES YOU CAN DO ALL OF THOSE AND I THINK
JUST WORKING ON ON ON LADIES IN HOLLYWOOD WOULD BE I DON'T KNOW THERE'D BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'D LOSE FROM YOUR WRITING BY JUST DOING THAT I THINK SO WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON NEXT BRIEFLY WHAT AM I WORKING ON NEXT WELL I'VE WRITTEN A MOVIE ABOUT THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBINGS FROM FROM A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH IS ANOTHER TRUE STORY AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN BOSTON RESEARCHING THAT SO THAT SHOOTS IN APRIL'S CALL PATRIOT STAY

QUARTER TO NINE THIN LIZZY OR ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS BANDS OF THE SEVENTIES WITH HITS LIKE THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN AND DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT THEY WERE LED BY THE FLAMBOYANT CHARISMATIC PHIL LINE WAS OFTEN DESCRIBED AS IRELAND'S FIRST ROCK STAR HE DIED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND TO MARK THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH THERE IS A NEW BIOGRAPHY IS AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE AND CAREER OUR ARTS CORRESPONDENT REBECCA JONES BEEN FINDING OUT A BIT MORE HE WAS UTTERLY MAGNA
WHEN YOU'RE UP ON STAGE AND FILM YOU JUST CANNOT ROUGE THERE'S ENTHUSED
ONE OF THE GREAT ROCK'N'ROLL
LONG AND LEAN WEARING LEATHER TROUSERS AND A STUDDED WRIST BAND
PHIL NINE IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY GOOD THE ROCK STAR YEAH GENTS GUN
IN THE WAY GRAHAM THOMPSON WHO'S WRITTEN COWBOY SONG A NEW BOOK ABOUT THE SINGER SAYS HE WAS AN INCREDIBLY POTENT SHOWMAN HE WAS LIKE A GENERAL LEADING AN ARMY HE WOULD SHOW ARE YOU OUT THERE ARE YOU READY
CALLED THE FOUND SUPPORT
BUT THE FOOTBALL CLUB HAS INCREDIBLE BOND BETWEEN BAND AND AUDIENCE WHICH VERY FEW BANDS I THINK BEFORE OR SINCE MANAGED
FILM LINE ITS RISE TO FAME WAS REMARKABLE GIVEN HIS COMPLICATED CHILDHOOD GROWING UP ON THE STREETS OF DUBLIN
BLACK AND ILLEGITIMATE SO HE WAS THE SON OF A CATHOLIC TEENAGER AND A STOWAWAY FROM BRITISH GUIANA
AND THAT BACKGROUND SAYS GRAHAM THOMPSON PUT HIM IN A UNIQUE POSITION IF YOU TRY AND THINK ABOUT JUST BLACK ROCK STARS AT THAT TIME THERE REALLY WAS ONLY JIMI HENDRIX EVERYONE ELSE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WAS BLACK WAS REALLY INVOLVED IN FUNK OR R. AND B. YOU'RE RAGGING YOUR SOIL IN THERE WASN'T REALLY A BLACK ROCK STAR
FOR HIM TO BE AN IRISH BLACK ROCK STARTING ON THE WHITEST OF COUNTRIES REALLY THERE WAS I THINK FOR INDIGENOUS BLACK IRISHMEN IN THE LATE SIXTIES SO THAT TELLS YOU HOW UNUSUAL HE WAS AND I THINK THE SENSE OF DIFFERENCE WAS CRUCIAL IN DICTATING WHAT HE ENDED UP
NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN WAS PASSED STANDARD IT'S GOT A PRETTY SILKY SMOOTH EVEN WHOOSH
I THINK GUITARIST SCOTT GORHAM JOIN THIN LIZZY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND BECAME FIRM FRIENDS WITH PHIL LAURENT
WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE ON THE ROAD HE WAS A GOOD ROW IN A SENSE THE WINE
WE DID TEND TO OVERPLAY IT QUITE A BIT IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORDS BECAUSE IN THE BOOK YOU SAY THINGS GOT STUPIDLY OUT OF HAND AT TIMES WHY DID YOU REIGN AND COME UP YOU WERE GOING TO BE ADDICTED TO DRUGS OR YOUR DRUG DEALERS WILL BEAT THE DOORS DOWN TRYING TO GET IN THE RECORDING STUDIO BECAUSE WE WERE A MAN THERE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF JAIL TIME GOING ON EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
FIGHTS I DON'T THINK I'D EVER BE IN AS MANY FIST PLACE AND WERE ALIVE THEY'D BE IN A BIT PHIL
THE TAIL BUOY SO WE'RE HERE IN THIS TOWN AND IN THE END IT ALL GOT TOO MUCH WELL SCOTT GORHAM MANAGED TO ADDRESS HIS ADDICTIONS THEY OVERPOWERED PHIL LINE IT
HE DIED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX HE WAS JUST THIRTY SIX YEARS OLD I MISSED PHIL BECAUSE HE WAS A PAL WITH A GOOD FRIEND AND I
OFTEN THINK ABOUT IF HE WERE STILL WITH US TODAY AND WITH THEN WAS IT WAS TO GATHER WHAT THAT WOULD BE LIKE TO DO IT I THINK IT WOULD ACTUALLY
DAMN GOOD BAD AND I AM JUST THE CARE I KNOW IT'S TREE THIS LEGACY IS CULTURAL AND MUSICAL HE KICKED A LOT OF DOORS BANDS I KNOW BYWORDS FOR HUGE INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM LIKE YOU TWO WERE HELPED IMMEASURABLY BY PHIL LINE BOB GELDOF TOLD ME HE WOULD LOOK CAN SEE BOYS ARE BACK IN TIME IN THE CHANCE
AND YOU WOULD THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME WE CAN ACTUALLY DEAL US THERE'S LITTLE COUNTRY THAT STONE TRODDEN ANOTHER MASSIVE INFERIORITY COMPLEX AND PEOPLE DID LOOK TO HIM FOR INSPIRATION
AND THE MUSIC AND THERE'S FOUR OR FIVE SONGS AND DELIVER THE CATWALK THAT IT WAS JUST GREAT POWERFUL ENDURING PORTANT MUSIC FROM ANOTHER KIND OF POETRY TO IT BUT I THINK A LOT OF SEVENTIES HARD ROCK DOESN'T NOW
REBEKAH JONES REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO NINE HOWEVER A PIECE OF LEGISLATION STARTS POSSIBLY JUST AS AMUSING ON THE BACK OF AN ENVELOPE IT ALWAYS ENDS IN THE SAME WAY
WRITTEN UP ON CALFSKIN OR VELLUM THAT'S BEEN THE CASE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS BUT LAST WEEK WE WERE TOLD THAT USING VELLUM WAS BEING PHASED OUT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE NOW THOUGH WE'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S BEEN SAVED BECAUSE THE CABINET OFFICE HAS NOW AGREED TO FOOT THE BILL WE'RE JOINED BY PAUL BRIGHT WHO'S THE GENERAL MANAGER MATT GENERAL MANAGER OF A WILLIAM COWLEY WHICH IS A COMPANY THAT MAKES THE VELLUM GOOD MORNING TO YOU
YOU MUST BE THRILLED GIVEN I SUPPOSE THAT ONE OF YOUR SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS WAS ABOUT TO PULL THE CONTRACT
WE WIN AND I WAS MAD AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT'S THE POINT OF VELLUM IS THAT IT LASTS FOR A LONG TIME
BECAUSE WHAT'S THE SEA YOU'RE EITHER USING VELLUM WHICH IS EXPENSIVE BUT LAST YOU SOAP EXPENSIVE IT'S NOT MY BACARDI CURRENTLY INCLUDED IT'S GETTING CHEAPER BY THE MAGNA CARTA WORKED OUT AS A WHAT WE CALL THAT SORT OF STATE THEY LEFT BIT OF STORIES DATA STORAGE LIKE RICOTTA STICK FOUND A CENTURY THAT
HOW HOW HOW EXPENSIVE IS THAT AGAINST SO VELLUM AT HOW LONG DO WE HAD TO UNDERSTAND THE VELLUM LAST FIGHT ANYBODY FIGHT
YOU COULD JUST ROLL IT UP AND YOU COULD LEAVE IT AT THE SQUAD WENT ANYWHERE
BUT BEFORE I COULD GET IT QUITE A GOOD ONE WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT FOR SOME OTHER FORM OF PAPER THAT YOU WOULD MIGHT USE FOR ARCHIVE
THAT'S THE SORT OF
WHICH LASTS A FEW HUNDRED YEARS UNDER HIS SPELL I CAN'T BITS OF EVERY THOUGHT I GOT SOAKED SPOKEN ABOUT IT ALL I JUST FELT THAT THERE WERE EIGHT OR NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE EFFECTIVELY WERE DECIDING THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS WOULD BE CAKE YOU'D HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WHAT THE AMERICANS CALL TOUCH HISTORY AND THERE CAN'T BE MANY OF YOU MAKING VELLUM THOSE SO I KNOW I APPRECIATE YOU ALL YOUR CONCERN YOUR EYES ARE ON THE HIGHER PRIZE OF FOR THE NATION SAKE HE'S NOT THAT'S YOUR COMPANY IMAGINE
THE WORLD MOST NATIONS WERE TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH US WE WERE ABOUT TO SORT OF STAND STILL THEY ALL SORT OF GOT TO BE ON CALL RIGHT WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE O.K. THANKS VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW SIX MINUTES TO NINE RICHARD DAWKINS PERHAPS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL BIOLOGIST OF HIS GENERATION BECAUSE THESE WORK ON GENES AND EVOLUTION HAS HAD A STROKE NOT ONE HOPES IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANYWAY A DESPERATELY SERIOUS ONE HERE'S HOW HE HIMSELF DESCRIBED IT ON HIS WEBSITE
I'M AT HOME HAVING BEEN FOUR DAYS IN HOSPITAL AND I'D I'M TOLD I'M GETTING MUCH BETTER WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT ON FRIDAY FIFTH OF FEBRUARY
I WAS AT HOME ALONE AND I SUDDENLY BECAME AWARE THAT MY LEFT ARM WAS NOT BEHAVING PROPERLY I COULDN'T COORDINATE PROPERLY WHEN I TRIED TO STAND UP I STAGGERED ABOUT IN A RATHER ALARMING WAY
I MUST HAVE FALLEN BECAUSE I LATER DISCOVERED A LARGE BRUISE ON MY ELBOW I WAS IMMEDIATELY SHOT THAT I MUST BE HAVING A STROKE
WELL WELL WHAT HAPPENED AFTERWARDS WHAT TURN THAT INTO
BIG STORY REALLY BIGGER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK IS THEIR REACTION TO HIS ILLNESS AS WELL AS BEING A RENOWNED SCIENTIST OF COURSE PROFESSOR DAWKINS IS BRITAIN'S MOST FAMOUS ATHEIST
AND THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TROLLING HIM YOU LOSING ITS OFFICIAL TWITTER PAGE TO SEE IT IS PRAYING FOR HIM I'M JOINED BY THE REVEREND OUR OWN AURORA WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND THEREFORE PRESUMABLY THE PATROLLER IN CHIEF MY AURORA GOOD MORNING THE GOOD SPEED
ARE YOU GUILTY NO I DON'T THINK SO IT WILL IF I AM I'M GUILTY OF WISHING SOMEBODY WELL OF PRAYING FOR THEIR RECOVERY AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT MY HOPE AND MY PRAYER IS THAT RICHARD DAWKINS IS IN GOOD HEALTH SUIT MAKES A FOAL AND SWIFT RECOVERY
WELL IT WAS RE RE TWEETED ONE AT LEAST AT THE LAST TIME WE LOOKED AT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE TIMES AND THERE WERE MANY RESPONSES SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY RATHER CRITICAL SARCASTIC ASKED ONE OF THEM OR IGNORANT
TOP TROLLING THERE BY THE SEA OR THE AND THE OBVIOUS REASON FOR THEM SAYING THAT IS THAT HE IS A NON BELIEVER
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT HE WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU TO ASK PEOPLE TO PRAY FOR HIM FOR YOUR GOD CREATES NOT HIS GOD NOW IT'S NOT BUT I THINK PART OF IT IS IT'S WHO WE ARE POETS WRITE POETRY MUSICIANS MAKE MUSIC AND CHRISTIANS PRAY AND WE PRAY FOR ALL UNLOVED
I THINK THE INTEREST WILL BE BRAVE AT ALL I MEAN PRESUMABLY YOU DON'T BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WILL PRAY FOR SAINTS FOR SIMMERS FOR CRIMINALS FOR GOVERNMENTS FOR MONARCHS FOR REFUGEES UNGRY THE UNWELL I'M NOT WELL SO WHEN YOU PUT PEPPER ARE PRAYING FOR A SINNER I MEAN IF HE HAD BEEN PRAYING FOR LET'S SAY ADOLF HITLER NOT A VERY ORIGINAL THOUGHT OR STALIN OR SOMEBODY WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID WHAT DO YOU ASK GOD TO DO WHAT WE PRAY FOR SINNERS EVERY WEEK ON THE BASIS THAT WE ALL ARE
AND I THINK THE GRADIENTS OF SIN WITHIN WITHIN YOUR QUESTION I THINK DOESN'T COME INTO IT SO MUCH HAS GRACE AND I THINK I DON'T FOLLOW YOU THEY'LL HOW ABOUT I THINK PART OF THE RESPONSE ON TWITTER AND THE FASCINATING THING HAS BEEN AN ASSUMPTION THAT BECAUSE RICHARD'S AND A POEM OF RELIGION THAT SOMEHOW WE MUST WISH HIM ILL
AND I THINK NO INSANE IN PUTTING OUT THE TWEET PRAYING FOR HIM AND PRAYING THAT HE WOULD GET WELL I THINK THERE WAS AN ASSUMPTION ON TWITTER FROM THOSE WHO RESPONDED SAYING WELL HOW HOW CAN HE HE'S AN OPPONENT HOW CAN YOU WISH HIM WELL HOW CAN YOU I WANT YOU DIDN'T JUST WISHING WELL DID IT DID YOU YOU SAID YOU WANT PEOPLE TO PRAY FOR HIM SO THEREFORE
UNDERLINED OUT OBVIOUSLY IS IF THEY ASK GOD TO HELP HIM GET WELL HE'S GOT A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING WELL THAN IF THEY DON'T ASK GOD TO HELP HIM IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN WHAT THE TWEET SAID WAS THAT WE ARE PRAYING FOR RICHARD DAWKINS AND I THINK AS CHRISTIANS THAT'S THE VERY MOST WE CAN USE TO ENTREAT HER TO PRAY
TO ASK THAT HE BE WELL BUT HE'S HEALED BUT HE'S IN FULL HEALTH AND MAKES A SWIFT RECOVERY ALL ON THE OTHER HAND YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE SAID LET'S PRAY FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S HAD A STROKE AND EVERYBODY'S HILLMAN EVERYBODY USED PAUL AND EVERYBODY'S
SO IF YOU WERE BEING SPECIFIC I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE THING AND WE WERE BEING SPECIFIC BECAUSE IT WAS RESPONDING TO A NEWS REPORT OF RICHARD STROKE I THINK YOU WEREN'T JUST SEEKING A BIT OF PUBLICITY FOR THE STRUGGLING CHURCH OF ENGLAND
NO I DON'T THINK THAT WE'D HAVE IN ANY THOUGHTS THAT IT WOULD HAVE A LISTED THIS KIND RESPONSE I THINK AT ITS HEART IT'S ABOUT RECOGNISING THAT PRAYERS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE BOTH SOMETHING EVERYONE CAN DO BUT ALSO FOR ALL AND AS CHRISTIANS WE WOULD PRAY FOR ALL THEM WE WOULD WISH RICHARD A SWIFT RECOVERY
BUT WE LOVE ALL WE PILE WERE COMMANDED TO DO THAT AND PRAYER IS THE PLACE WHERE WE GO TO DO THAT ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED REVEREND AURORA THANKS IT'S A COUPLE OF MINUTES TONIGHT JUST BEFORE WE GO LET'S GET AN UPDATE FROM ISRAEL THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER THERE HOOD ON THAT HAS BEGUN A NINETEEN MONTH JAIL SENTENCE FOR CORRUPTION A CORRESPONDENT IN JERUSALEM IS YOLANDA YOLANDA THIS IS BEEN GOING ON A LONG TIME AT HIS LONG RUNNING CASE AGAINST HIM

THE ECONOMIST WHO LED AN INQUIRY INTO HOW TO PREVENT THE COLLAPSE OF BANKS SAYS THE BANK OF ENGLAND PLANS TO PROTECT THE SYSTEM NEED TO BE MUCH STRONGER SO JOHN VICKERS WHO HAD AT THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON BANKING ONCE BANKS TO HAVE MORE CAPITAL IN RESERVE TO AVOID ANOTHER CRISIS IN THE INDUSTRY
SO JOHN TOLD TODAY THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAD MADE REASONABLE PROGRESS ON THE ISSUE BUT NEEDED TO GO SIGNIFICANTLY FURTHER
IN MY VIEW WHAT THEY PROPOSED WAS DISAPPOINTING WAS I'M AMBITIOUS AND A THICK A BUFFER WOULD BE A BETTER WAY TO GO IF YOU LIKE IT WOULD GIVE US BETTER INSURANCE BETTER SHOCK ABSORPTION IF MORE LIKELY WHEN THE NEXT CRISIS HITS
