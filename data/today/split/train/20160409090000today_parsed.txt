CORNELIUS LYCETT REPORTING THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HAS DISCOVERED THROUGH A NEWSPAPER INVESTIGATION THAT THE MAN WHO BROUGHT HIM UP WAS NOT HIS REAL FATHER THE STORY DOMINATES THIS MORNING'S TELEGRAPH AND A RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE WYATT JOINS US NOW HOW DID ALL OF THIS EMERGE CAROLINE WELL IT SEEMS TO HAVE COME ABOUT BY THE FATHER VIA THE FAMILY OF WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE HIS NATURAL FATHER
AND HE'S PUT OUT HIS OWN PERSONAL STATEMENT WHICH SAYS THAT BEGINS BY SAYING I'VE DISCOVERED MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER IS NOT GAVIN WELL BE BUT IN FACT THE LATE SIR ANTHONY MONTAGUE BROWNE AND THEN WITH SOME UNDERSTATEMENT GOES ON TO SAY THIS COMES AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE
AND HE GOES INTO HIS FAMILY HISTORY AND SAYS HIS MOTHER JANE WILLIAMS AND FATHER GOVERNED WELL PEOPLE BOTH ALCOHOLICS AND HIS MOTHER HAVE BEEN IN RECOVERY NOW SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT HASN'T TOUCHED ALCOHOL FOR OVER FORTY EIGHT YEARS
AND THAT HIS FATHER OF THE MAN HE THOUGHT HE WAS HIS FATHER DIED AS A RESULT OF ALCOHOL AND SMOKING BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
AND HE SAID AS A RESULT OF HIS PARENTS' ADDICTIONS THAT HIS EARLY LIFE WAS MESSY AS HE PUTS IT ON WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED IS THAT SOMEONE FROM THAT FAMILY GOT IN TOUCH VIA CHARLES MOORE OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH DAILY TELEGRAPH GOT IN TOUCH WITH JUSTIN WELBY
AND SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN RUMOURS FOOT HE HIS REAL FATHER WILL STOP WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND ALMOST I SUSPECT TO DISPEL THE RUMOURS
THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY TOOK A D.N.A. TEST AND THE D.N.A. TEST CAME BACK AND THE D.N.A. TEST SHOWED THAT WITH AN OVER NINETY NINE PERCENT CERTAINTY HE WAS NOT IN FACT THE SOUND OF JUSTIN WELBY BUT OF ANTHONY MONTAGUE PROUD WHO HAD WORKED WITH HIS MOTHER FOR WINSTON CHURCHILL WON'T YES WERE WOOD WHICH IS WHAT MAKES A NEWSWORTHY BEYOND THE FACT THAT OFTEN WELL BE BEYOND BEYOND THE POSITION THAT HE HOLDS
WELL THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN HE'S SICK HE'S AND INTERESTING STORY BECAUSE JUSTIN WELBY HAD ALREADY HAD THIS INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AND FOR AN ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY VERY UNUSUAL LIFE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY A LION WHO WAS THE SON OF SOMEONE JEWISH WHO HAD BECOME AN ALCOHOLIC HAVING
ALL OF THAT HISTORY AND THEN GOING BEYOND IT TO SAY HE WAS ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HE'D BE VERY LUCKY IN THE WAY HE WAS BROUGHT UP IT HAD A VERY BLESSED LIFE AND NOW THIS SO I THINK MY ALSO MAKES IT UNUSUAL IS THAT HIS MOTHER LAID OUR TRAIN LADY WILLIAMS HAS PUT OUT HER OWN STATEMENT ABOUT THE MARRIAGE
AND EXPLAINING IT AND THINK THAT WHEN SHE HAD THIS D.N.A. EVIDENCE RECENTLY IT WAS A GOOD EASTER WEEK LUMP THAT JUST WITH THE WELBYS FOUND OUT I SAID THAT WHEN SHE WAS PRESENTED WITH THAT PROVING THAT GAVIN WELL BE WAS NOT JUSTIN'S BIOLOGICAL FATHER SO MANY YEARS AFTER GAVIN'S DEATH SHE SAID HAD COME AS AN ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE SHOCK AND SHE GOES ON TO EXPLAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN DRINKING HEAVILY AT TIME SHE'D HAD A LIAISON
WITH THAT THE WHAT DIGORY BROWN IT SHE SAYS IT APPEARS THAT PRECAUTIONS TAKE TIME DIDN'T WORK AND THAT HER WONDERFUL SONG WAS CONCEIVED AS A RESULT WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE ARCHBISHOP'S BIOGRAPHER AND TO CHARLES MOORE OF THE TELEGRAPH UNCOVERED THE STORY AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK CAROLINE THANK YOU IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN JEREMY CORBIN AS ACCUSE DAVID CAMERON OF MISLEADING THE PUBLIC OVER HIS INVOLVEMENT IN OFFSHORE TAX AVOIDANCE IT FOLLOWS MY CAMERA'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT BEFORE HE BECAME PRIME MINISTER HE HAD SOLD SHARES IN AN OFFSHORE COMPANY SET UP BY HIS FATHER
ALAN SODI IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALAN IS THE LABOUR LEADER SUGGESTING THAT HE IS STILL MISLEADING THE PUBLIC OR IS THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE PAST WEEK THE FACT THAT IT'S TAKEN A WEEK FOR IT TO MATCH WHAT THE ACCUSATION WOULD APPEARS TO BE FROM JEREMY CORBIN THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS GIVEN A SERIES OF PARTIAL TRUTHS ACROSS THE COURSE OF THE WEEK IT'S NOT CLEAR FROM WHAT HE'S SAYING AS TO WHETHER HE THINKS THERE IS MORE TO COME IT MAY WELL BE
THE WORDING OF IT WHERE HE USES THIS PHRASE MISLED THE PUBLIC LOST THE TRUST OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE THIS HE IS SIMPLY REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE GONE FROM A POSITION FROM DOWNING STREET ON MONDAY OF THEM SAYING IT'S A PRIVATE MATTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER USING THE PRESENT TENSE BY TUESDAY TO SAY THIS HE DID NOT MAKE ANY MONEY FROM OFFSHORE FUNDS OR WHATEVER THEN DOWNING STREET CLARIFYING THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE FUTURE THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE CAMERON FAMILY FROM ANY TAX HAVENS AND ONLY THEN FINALLY FRITZ WHO EMERGED IN THE PRIME MINISTER
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT UNTIL TWENTY TEN YES HE DID HAVE THIS STAKE IN HIS FATHER'S OFFSHORE FIRM BUT NOW LABOUR IS GOING TO TRY WHEN PARLIAMENT RETURNS FROM ITS EASTER BREAKS OR BRING URGENT QUESTIONS ON ALL OF THIS NEXT WEEK ALSO DAVID CAMERON AS PROMISED TO PUBLISH HE HIS TAX RETURNS AS WELL NOT CLEAR HOW MANY YEARS THEY WILL GO BACK BUT WHAT IT DOES MEAN IS THAT THIS STORY IS STILL NOT GOING AWAY FOR THE PRIME MINISTER HE'S PROMISED TO PUBLISH HIS TAX RETURNS BEFORE HASN'T HE
THIS HAS BEEN RAISED BEFORE AND SOMETIMES WITH POLITICIANS YOU DON'T THINK THESE SORT OF THINGS CAN BE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE RAISED AND CERTAINLY I REMEMBER AN EPISODE IN THE PAST WHERE THIS HAS COME UP WITH THIS IT SEEMS AS THOUGH IT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN THOUGH AS I SAY THE INDICATION FROM DOWNING STREET IS THAT THEN
QUITE READY TO PUBLISH THEM YES IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT'S A MATTER OF DAYS OR WHATEVER BEFORE THEY ARE PUBLISHED AND EXACTLY HOW MANY YEARS THEY WILL GO BACK BUT DOUBTLESS WHEN THAT DOES HAPPEN THEY WILL BE SCRUTINISED AND EVEN THOUGH DOWNING STREET IS VERY ADAMANT HERE THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS DECLARED
WHAT HE NEEDED TO DECLARE AT THE TIME THAT EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T DECLARE THIS INTEREST IN HIS FATHER'S OFFSHORE BUSINESS WHEN HE BECAME AN M.P. OR INDEED WHEN HE BECAME LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THAT HE WAS COMPLYING WITH THE RULES AT THE TIME BUT FROM JEREMY CORBIN'S ATTACK TODAY ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF TRUST IT'S NOT SO MUCH SUGGESTING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAD ACTUALLY BROKEN ANY RULES IN IN ITSELF IT'S MORE ABOUT HOW IT MIGHT APPEAR TO THE PUBLIC ALAN SODI THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S QUARTER PAST SEVEN BELGIAN POLICE ARE TRYING TO ESTABLISH WHETHER ONE OF THE FIVE MEN ARRESTED YESTERDAY ON SUSPICION OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE BROTHELS ATTACKS MAY BE THE MAN IN THE HAT SCENE IN C.C.T.V. FOOTAGE OF THE AIRPORT DIM INGRAM ATTICUS IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN BRUSSELS WHAT ARE THE POLICE SAYING
WELL WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AT THE MINUTE IS THIS MAN MOHAMMED BREENIE AID THE ARE INVESTIGATING TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER HE IS THE MAN IN THE HAT AT THIRD AIRPORT BOTHERED THAT'S THE OFFICIAL LINE WHAT THEY KNOW IS THAT HE WAS INVOLVED OR HE WAS LINKED TO THE PARIS ATTACKS SO HE THEY KNOW HE'S PART OF THE EXTENDED GROUP
THAT TOOK PART IN THESE ATTACKS HE WAS SEEN HIS CONNECTION TO PARIS IS WELL KNOWN AND IS CLEAR TO THAT I THINK IN THAT HE WAS SEEN DELIVERING A CAR THAT WAS USED IN PARIS BY THE PARIS ATTACKERS TO PARIS JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE ON THE SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE HIS D.N.A. TRACES THEY SAID WERE FOUND IN THAT CAR AND THEN IN PROPERTIES USED IN BRUSSELS AS SAFE HOUSES
ONE OF WHICH WAS USED TO PREPARE THE BOMBS THAT WERE USED IN THE BRUSSELS ATTACKS THE THEIR PIECE OF THE JIGSAW THAT THEY HAVEN'T FINALLY FITTED IN IS A IT'S A FINAL IDENTIFICATION WHETHER HE IS THAT THIRD FINGER BUT THEY SEEM PRETTY HE'S PRETTY CERTAIN
OF AN OVERALL SENSE CERTAINLY THAT THIS WAS ONE NETWORK IT'S SUSPECTED OF BOTH THESE ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS AND PARIS
SEE IT SEEMS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR NOW THAT IT WAS AND THIS ARREST YESTERDAY OF MOHAMMED OR BREENIE IS ALSO ONE OF THE SORT OF PIECES THAT PULLS THAT WHOLE PUZZLE TOGETHER BECAUSE HE IS VERY CLEARLY THEY'VE CLARY CLEARLY TIED HIM INTO THE PARIS ATTACKS NOW THEY CAME OUT THE POLICE CAME LAST NIGHT AND SAID THAT HIS D.N.A. LINK WAS LINKED TO ALL THE
BROTHELS ARE TARIQ'S IF HE IS THE BRUSSELS THE THIRD BRUSSELS AIRPORT BY THE ONE WHO LEFT HER BAG AND RAN AWAY FROM THE SCENE THEN THEN YOU HAVE THE CLEAREST LINK A BALL THAN WHAT WE'VE HEARD PRIVATELY FROM A SOURCE WHO HAS KNOWLEDGE OF THE POLICE INVESTIGATION IS THAT INVESTIGATORS ARE NINETY FIVE PERCENT SURE
IT IS HIM THAT THEY HAVE THE THIRD MAN BUT AT THE MINUTE THEY'RE BEING CAUTIOUS BECAUSE YOU MAY REMEMBER A WEEK AGO OR SO THEY HAD A DIFFERENT MAN IN CUSTODY WHO THEY WERE THEY
I THOUGHT COULDN'T BE THAT MAN IN THE HURT AND IT TURNED OUT IT WASN'T THAT THEY HAD TO RELEASE HIM SO THAT THEY'RE JUST THEY'VE BEEN CAREFUL I THINK JUST FINALLY DAME INTO THIS COMPLICATE ANYTHING IN TERMS OF THE EXTRADITION OF CELL UP SALAAM TO TO FRANCE AND WHO LEADS THIS INVESTIGATION GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE THIS ONE SUSPECTED NETWORK AND ATTACKS IN TWO COUNTRIES
NO I DON'T THINK SO I MEAN I THINK THE FRENCH POLICE ARE VERY KEEN OBVIOUSLY TO GET TO TALK CELEBS SLUM HE STILL IN IN BELGIUM
HE'S HERE BECAUSE BELGIAN POLICE STILL HAVE TO COMPLETE THEIR INQUIRIES INTO ALL HIS ACTIVITIES HERE BUT WHAT'S ALSO CLEAR I THINK IS THAT ACTUALLY BELGIAN FRENCH POLICE HAVE BEEN CO OPERATING VERY VERY CLOSELY SINCE THE PARIS ATTACKS AND THAT CLOSE CO OPERATION SHE HAS BEEN IMPORTANT IN SOME OF THE ARREST WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST WEEK OR TEN DAYS HERE IN BRUSSELS
A REST NOT JUST TO PEOPLE CONNECTED NOW TO THE BRUSSELS AND PARIS ATTACKS BUT THEY HAVE BEEN ARRESTS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF PEOPLE PLANNING BEING WHO WERE ACCUSED OF PLANNING NEW ATTACKS IN FRANCE ARRESTS IN FRANCE IN THE NETHERLANDS SO ACROSS EUROPE ARISING FROM THAT CO OPERATION DAME INCOME ATTICUS AND BRUSSELS THANK YOU

YORKSHIRE ARE FAVOURITES FOR HER THIRTY THIRD COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE THIS YEAR REALLY PROMOTED LANCASHIRE JUST HOPE TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR DIVISION ONE PLACE BUT THEY ARE THE TOP TEAM AT TWENTY TWENTY
SO WHY NOT ASK THEIR PLAYERS WHICH FORM OUT OF THE GAME THEY PREFER OBVIOUSLY CHAMPIONSHIP BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT'S LOWER CRICKET THE MOST EXCITING ISN'T IT THE BOTH OF QUALITIES IT IN THEIR OWN REALLY BOOKED IS WHEN HIS WORDS THAT REALLY I'M VERY MUCH OLD SCHOOL ACCOUNTS CHAMPIONSHIP I WOULDN'T PICK BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM BUT IT'S T. TWENTY THAT GETS THE ADRENALIN GOING IS THAT IT
THEIR STAR BOWLER IS ENGLAND'S LEADING TEST WICKET TAKER JIMMY ANDERSON THE GAME'S SHORTER FORMAT NOT SO MUCH HIS THING AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE SEES THE ISSUE OF RED VERSES WHITE BALL CRICKET AS A RACE
I KNOW TWO TWENTY IS HOT ON THE HEELS OF TEST CRICKET BUT I THINK HOPEFULLY FROM THE COUNTY POINT OF VIEW THAT PEOPLE STILL PUT EMPHASIS ON THAT FOR DAYS
A SIMILAR DAY AT THE OVAL WITH SURREY WHO WERE ALSO PROMOTED WITH TWENTY TWENTY TICKET SELLING WELL FOR THIS SEASON THEY KNOW THAT MEAGRE FOR DAY ATTENDANCES DON'T MATTER AND THEY'RE WHAT YOU MIGHT DESCRIBE AS THEIR GREATER PURPOSE HAS A FUTURE RICHARD GIL CHIEF EXEC
THE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP HAS HE ATTENDANCES NORMALLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED TODAY WE ALL WANT TO WIN THE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP WE KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE MONEY BUT IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT MONEY ISN'T IT ISN'T IT REALLY ALL ABOUT MONEY FROM YOUR OFFICE EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE NO IT'S NOT IT'S ABOUT HAVING A CLUB THAT PEOPLE ON A BELONG TO ENGLISH CULTURE WHAT BETTER EXAMPLE OF ENGLISH AND WELSH CULTURE AND SO CAN THERE BEING OTHER THAN A CATEGORY CLUB
FRELLING CAN BIG NAME BIG HIT OKUMA SANGHA CARA IS IN HIS SECOND SEASON AT SURREY AND AS ENTHUSIASTIC ADVOCATE OF THE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP AND YET
THERE'S A REAL SENSE IN WHICH IT'S JUST A MEANS TO AN END THE PRODUCTION OF A STRONG ENGLAND HERE I THINK IT'S ABOUT LEARNING TO APPLY YOUR SKILLS IN A VERY TOUGH ENVIRONMENT THE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP
REALLY IMPACTED POSITIVELY ON ENGLISH CRICKET YOU CAN SEE THE RESULTS IN THE AIR SHOULD YOU CAN SEE THE RESULT OF ONE DAY CRICKET NOW YOU CAN SEE THE RESULT IN THE LAST YEAR TO ANY WORLD CUP I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT DONE TO CHANGE PLAYING ATTITUDE TO CHANGE MANAGEMENT CLUB AND COUNTY ATTITUDE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST PLUSSES OF CAN'T BE CRICKET BUT RETURNING TO TWENTY TWENTY
NO ONE DISAGREES AND ESPECIALLY NOT IN LANCASHIRE IT IS EXCITING AND HE COMES TO WAKELEY BALLS IT TENDS TO GO SO FAR
BUT SOME SAY THE NAT WEST BLAST FORMAT IS UNWIELDY TOO MANY TEENS EIGHTEEN ENGLAND'S BEN STOKES FOR EXAMPLE ARGUES FOR A TWENTY TWENTY RESTRUCTURING EIGHT FRANCHISE TEAMS BASED ON CITIES LIKE IN AUSTRALIA

TO TWENTY SO WE CAN'T BE DOING EVERYTHING WRONG BUT FOR ME IT'S IMPORTANT WE FIND A MODEL THAT PROTECTS THE WHOLE GAME SO AS COUNTY CRICKET AS LIMBER UP IN THEIR NETS THE LAST WORD GOES TO SURREY IS DIRECTOR OF CRICKET FORMER ENGLAND CAPTAIN ALEC STEWART HE SEES NO TENSION ONLY A COMPLIMENTARY COEXISTENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FORM
IN THE COUNTIES HAVE A DUTY TO PROMOTE ALL FORMATS WHICH IS QUITE RIGHT TWENTY TWENTY IS OBVIOUSLY A GREAT STORY AND IT'S BEEN ALMOST GOT SENT FOR SO MANY COUNTIES THAT THEY GET THAT REVENUE COMING IN WHICH FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TWENTY TWENTY'S HERE TO STAKE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AND IT HAS TO DO BUT FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP CRICKET IS

THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT YET AGAIN WE HAVE A CASE OF A CHILD SUSTAINING HORRIFIC INJURIES AND DYING AT THE HANDS OF A PARENT THE MOTHER OF TWENTY ONE MONTH OLD AYESHIA JANE SMITH WAS CONVICTED YESTERDAY OF HER MURDER ONE OF THEIR CHILD'S INJURIES WAS A SEVERE LACERATION TO THE HOT HERE'S WHAT DETECTIVE INSPECTOR ANDY MAXFIELD OF STAFFORDSHIRE POLICE SAID OUTSIDE THE COURT
INJURIES DESCRIBE YOU WERE AKIN TO THOSE THAT ARE FOUND IN A ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENT OR OF THE CHILD FALLS FROM HEIGHT
DOCTOR KELLOGG AVON IS EVIDENCE OF CHILD THAT'S BEEN STAMPED ON AND WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THAT AND YOU PUT IT INTO CONTEXT IT'S POLLY FIVE
I HOPE THAT IT IS A CASE OF LESSON LESSONS AWAY IN NOT MISTAKES REPEATED
AND I'M SURE THAT THE SERIOUS CASE YOU USE A ROBUST PROCESS WILL IDENTIFY ANY REALLY AND I HOPE THAT IT IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND LESSONS
WELL I HAD BEEN KNOWN TO SOCIAL SERVICES SINCE BIRTH SHE LIVED IN STRETTON NEAR BURTON ON TRENT AND WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM THE RADIO CAR BY THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. FOR BERT AND ANDREW GRIFFITHS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THERE IS A SERIOUS CASE REVIEW NOW UNDERWAY FROM WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG
WELL I THINK IT WAS A MASSIVE FAILURE FROM EVERYBODY CONNECTED WITH THIS AT THE SERVICES HERE IN BUT THERE IS A REAL SENSE OF SHOCK THAT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITY A SENSE OF REVULSION AT THE VIOLENCE IN THE BRUTALITY OF THE WAY IT'LL EH SHE DIED BUT I THINK THERE IS ALSO A GROWING SENSE OF ANGER THAT THE AUTHORITIES DO SEEM TO HAVE LET DOWN THIS LITTLE CHILD
WHEN THEY HAD SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERVENE AND TO SAVE HER LIFE AND ONE OF THE ISSUES SEEMS TO BE WELL AS IS OFTEN THE CASE ONE SET OF OF PEOPLE INVOLVED NOT INFORMING THE OTHER FOR EXAMPLE CHILDREN SERVICES WERE APPARENTLY NOT EVEN AWARE THAT SHE HAD BEEN NOT JUST HOSPITALISED BUT IT REQUIRED RESUSCITATION
WHICH I THINK PEOPLE ARE TRULY SHOCKED AT HOW MANY OPPORTUNITIES DO PEOPLE LIKE SOCIAL SERVICES NEED TO INTERVENE THERE WERE SO MANY OCCASIONS AS YOU SAID THIS CHILD WAS KNOWN TO SOCIAL SERVICES FROM BIRTH SHE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN REMOVED AT ONE STAGE AND PLACED WITH FOSTER PARENTS AND THEN
THE HURT A CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE TO RETURN IT TO HER MUM WAS MADE BUT EVEN THEN THERE WERE JUST SO MANY OCCASIONS OCCASIONS WHEN SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE FIRE BRIGADE REPORTED THAT THEY WERE THERE WAS A SMELL OF DRUGS OR CANNABIS IN THE HOUSE AND THAT THEIR MUM SEEM SPACE OUT SPACE OUT THERE WERE SO MANY INSTANCES OF VIOLENCE AND DOMESTIC INCIDENTS AT THE HOME THAT WERE REPORTED TO POLICE AND REPORTED TO SOCIAL SERVICES
AND THEN THOSE TERRIBLE MISTAKES AT MISSING WHEN SHE PRESENTED AT HOSPITAL WITH A WITH A BRAIN INJURY FOR GOODNESS SAKE AND OTHER OCCASIONS WHEN SHE HAD SCRATCHES AND BRUISES AND CUTS ON HER LIP THAT THE ALARM BELLS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RINGING THE LIGHT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FLASHING
AND SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE HAS MADE A TERRIFIC TERRIFIC MISTAKE NOT TO INTERVENE TO SAVE THIS LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE BUT EVEN WHEN ALARM BELLS ARE RINGING THERE'S THERE'S ALSO EVIDENCE ISN'T THERE OF THE OF THE PRESSURE THAT SOCIAL SERVICE PARTICULAR CHILDREN'S SERVICES ARE UNDER PRESSURE IN THE COUNTY OF DERBYSHIRE NINE THOUSAND CHILDREN WERE REFERRED TO CHILDREN'S SERVICES
IN THE LOCAL AUTHORITY LAST YEAR IN ONE YEAR ALONE I DO UNDERSTAND I'M A STAFFORDSHIRE M.P. AND AYESHA'S CASE WAS DEALT WITH BY DERBYSHIRE SOCIAL SERVICES AND I DO UNDERSTAND BUT ONLY THE PRESSURE'S ON ON SOCIAL SERVICES AND SOCIAL WORKERS BUT ALSO THEIR JUDGEMENT CALLS ARE DIFFICULT JUDGEMENT CALLS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE IN DIFFICULT CONDITIONS
BUT IT APPEARS TO ME LOOKING FROM THE OUTSIDE WHAT IS GOING ON HERE THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED MUCH MUCH SOONER WE COULD HAVE ACTUALLY WHAT SHOULD I ONLY TIE WHAT SAVED HER LIFE WHAT HERD OF BEEN QUICKER IN HER PARTICULAR CASE BUT WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS THAT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT RELEVANT JUST THE BIT THAT THE AMOUNT OF CASES THAT THAT ONE COUNTY APPRECIATES NOT YOUR COUNTY ARE DEALING WITH A I CAN'T JOB SHARE A UNIQUE IN IN THERE THE PRESSURE THAT HE'S ON SOCIAL SERVICES
BUT BUT IT COMES DOWN TO THIS WEE WE HAVE HAD INVESTIGATIONS THE VICTORIA CLEM B.A. CASE THE BABY P. CASE WE HAVE INVESTIGATIONS AND LESSONS ARE SUPPOSEDLY LEARNED AND THEN THE SAME THING SEEMS TO HAPPEN AGAIN
YOU HEARD EARLIER THAT THERE IS A A REVIEW BY THE TOP SHOULD CHILDREN SAFEGUARDING BOARD I'M AFRAID AS THE LOCAL M.P. I'M NOT PARTICULARLY SATISFIED ABOUT THAT I THINK THERE IS A REAL NEED TO HAVE A VERY OPEN AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT WENT ON INTO THE DEATH OF A
AND TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE CLARITY SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES YOU TALK ABOUT THE VOLUME AND THE PRESSURE ON SOCIAL SERVICE RELENTED AND CUTS TO CHILDREN'S SERVICES IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BROADER LOOK AT AT THE LESSON'S BEEN LEARNED IT'S A VERY EASY THING TO SAY ISN'T IT RATHER THAN TO DO BUT IN DERBYSHIRE FOR EXAMPLE NEARLY SIX MILLION POUNDS WAS CUT FROM THE CHILDREN SERVICES BUDGET IN THE LAST YEAR I'M SORRY I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN EXCUSE WHEN S.O. I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU WHETHER IT'S RELEVANT TO A POINT ABOUT LEARNING LESSON
WHEN A SOCIAL WORKER SEES A CHILD AND HE KNOWS THAT THERE ARE BRUISING ON HER LEGS AND THEIR FINGER TRIP MARKS UP FINGERTIP MARKS ON HER NECK WHEN THERE ARE SMELLS OF CANNABIS WHEN THEY GO TO THE PROPERTY AND THE DOORS HAVE BEEN KICKED IN ALL MIRRORS HAVE BEEN SMASHED AT THAT'S NOT IT THAT'S NOT A RESOURCING ISSUE THAT'S A JUDGEMENT ISSUE I THINK THERE IS THERE APPEARS TO BE A REAL FAILURE OF JUDGEMENT AND CLARITY ON BEHALF OF DERBYSHIRE'S SOCIAL SERVICES HERE
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON AND NOT GET DISTRACTED WE NEED TO WORK OUT WHY THIS CHILD WASN'T SAVED AND WILDLIFE LIFE WAS LOST NEEDLESSLY AND POINTLESSLY ANDREW GRIFFITHS M.P. THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT TAKING A LOOK AT THE PAPERS THE GUARDIAN SAYS DAVID CAMERON IS FACING MOUNTING PRESSURE TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING HIS TAX AFFAIRS IT QUOTES THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY GORBY CORBIN SAYING IT TOOK FIVE WEASEL WORDED STATEMENTS IN FIVE DAYS FOR THE PRIME MINISTER TO ADMIT HE PROFITED FROM THE SALE OF SHARES IN AN OFFSHORE TRUST
BUT A GOVERNMENT SOURCE TELLS THE PAPER MY CAMERA'S DONE NOTHING WRONG AND HE ONLY CHOSE TO MAKE THE FRESH STATEMENT ON THURSDAY EVENING BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT HOW HIS FAMILY ESPECIALLY HIS MOTHER WILL BE INFECTED THE TIMES DESCRIBES MISTER CAMERON HAS BRUISED AND SAYS HE COULD FACE AN INVESTIGATION INTO CLAIMS HE FAILED TO PROPERLY DECLARE HIS SHARES BUT HE QUOTES A TAX SPECIALIST DEFENDING THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE U.K. WHO HAVE INVESTED IN SIMILAR FUNDS
THE PAPER'S EDITORIAL SAYS MISTER CAMERON DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BROKEN ANY LAWS BUT HE HAS REALISED HIS OWN WORST FEAR OF SEEMING OUT OF TOUCH THE TELEGRAPH DEVOTES MOST OF ITS FRONT PAGE AND SIX INSIDE PAGES TO THE REVELATION ABOUT THE FATHER OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY THE PAPER CLAIMS TO HAVE PIECED TOGETHER THE EVIDENCE INCLUDING A D.N.A. TEST WHICH PROVES THAT JUSTIN WELBY HIS FATHER IS SIR ANTHONY MONTAGUE BROWNE
IT'S EDITORIAL WRITER PRAISES THE ARCHBISHOP OF FOR THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAS DEALT WITH THE REVELATION SAYING HE'S DISPLAYED COURAGE GOOD HUMOUR DECISIVENESS AND STRAIGHTFORWARD ACCEPTANCE OF THE TRUTH THE FRONT PAGE HEADLINE IN THE TIMES IS BRITISH GUN SECRETLY SOLD TO TERRORISTS ON FACEBOOK IT SAYS REVOLVERS RIFLES AND SUBMACHINE GUNS THAT WERE BUILT OR DESIGNED IN BRITAIN HAD BEEN PUT UP FOR SALE AND SECRET ARMS TRADING GROUPS ON THE SOCIAL NETWORK IT CLAIMS THE WEAPONS WERE ADVERTISED ALONGSIDE ANTI TANK WEAPONS ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND ANTI AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS
THE PAPER SAYS THE DISCOVERY OF THE LISTINGS AS EMBARRASSING FOR FACEBOOK WHICH CLAIMS TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO COUNTER ILLEGAL ACTIVITY THE FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTS THAT FARMS IN ENGLAND HAVE SEEN THE STEEPEST FALL IN THEIR VALUE SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IT SAYS INVESTORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE RISK OF A LOSS OF FARM SUBSIDIES HAVE BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IN NOTES THE BRITISH FARMERS RECEIVE THREE POINT ONE BILLION EUROS A YEAR AND DIRECT SUPPORT FROM THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY WITHOUT WHICH MANY FAIR GOING OUT OF BUSINESS GIVEN THE CURRENT LOW PRICES FOR
MILK WHEAT PORK AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES FINALLY THE SUN LIKE MOST OF THE PAPERS LOOKS FORWARD TO THIS AFTERNOON'S GRAND NATIONAL IT REPORTS SOME PREDICTIONS BY BOOKIES THAT A RECORD TWO HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS WILL BE GAMBLED ON THE EVENT IT SAYS THAT'S DUE IN PART TO A LATER START TIME FIVE FIFTEEN P.M. AS WELL AS THE ONE MILLION POUND PRIZE POT AND MOVE TO SAFER FENCES WHICH HAS ATTRACTED SOME OF EUROPE'S ELITE HORSES
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT FOR THIS WEEK'S MEET THE AUTHOR JIM'S BEEN TALKING TO ONE OF BRITAIN'S LEADING COMIC WRITERS ABOUT HIS LONG CAREER AND HOW IT ALL BEGAN ON FLEET STREET AND SKI OR SPY MICHAEL FRAYN DRAMATISED BY
COPENHAGEN BY MICHAEL OFFERING WE PRESENT HEAD
ADAPTED FOR RADIO FROM THE NOVEL BY MICHAEL FRAYN MICHAEL FRAYN AS ONE OF THOSE RARE WRITERS WHO'S BEEN A SUCCESSFUL NOVELIST AND A DRAMATIST
HIS WIT MADE P.G. WOODHOUSE LAUGH NOISES OFF HIS MANY PEOPLE'S FUNNIEST FAST
AND HE'S BEEN SHORTLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE IT ALL BEGAN WITH HIS NEWSPAPER COLUMN IN THE GUARDIAN IN THE EARLY SIXTIES THE FORM TO WHICH HE RETURNED MUCH LATER IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES
A COLLECTION OF THOSE COLUMNS SPANNING MORE THAN THREE DECADES HE'S NOW OUT I ASKED HIM HOW IT ALL BEGAN
HAD A COLUMN OF ODD BITS AND PIECES ANYTHING BY READERS AND READERS FOR SENDING IN THIS ODD BITS AND PIECES SO THEY DECIDED TO GET ONE OF THE REPORTERS ME TO WRITE A REPORT IT CALL ON THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT DORRY I SUPPOSED TO GO UP AND UP INTO THE KIND OF THING YOU'RE DOING INTERVIEWING VISITING JOURNALISTS ACCURATE SORT OF A I SUPPOSE DO IT THREE TIMES A WEEK I JUST COULDN'T GET ENOUGH MATERIAL
RESEARCH IT AND WRITE IT THREE TIMES A WEEK SO THE COLUMN GOT SHORTER AND SHORTER AND IT SANK DOWN THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE AND IT WAS JUST ABOUT TO DIE OUT ALL THE OTHER FROM MY OWN NEWS EDITOR HARRY HEURE SO WHY DIDN'T I DO WHAT ABOUT THE COLOBUS AND GONE THAT'S INVENT SOME CHARACTERS AND PUT THEM IN WOULD BUT THE CLIMB OUT A BIT AND MAKE IT UP FOR YOURSELF MAKE IT APIA OR MAKING THINGS UP IS MUCH EASIER THAN GOING OUT AND RECEPTION
ALSO WHEN YOU GET SOME FICTITIOUS CHARACTERS THEY HELP ART THEY ARE KIND OF STAFF THEY DO ACTUALLY SEEM TO WRITE THEIR OWN STUFF OR YOUR INTERESTS AND SOMETIMES OBSESSIONS OVER THE YEARS LOOKING THROUGH THESE COLLECTED COLUMNS ARE SIMILAR IN THE SENSE THAT
THE TARGETS ARE OFTEN OBFUSCATION AT BUREAUCRATIC STUPIDITY THE TENDENCY NOT TO SEE WHAT YOU MEAN ALL THESE THINGS THE THINGS THAT REALLY GET UNDER OUR SKIN
THAT'S QUITE OFTEN THE JAM THAT MAKES A GOOD COLUMN IT IS I GAVE IT UP AFTER I'D BEEN DOING I THINK FOUR HUNDRED OR COLUMNS FIRST OF THE GUARDIAN AND THE OBSERVER
I THOUGHT I WAS BIGGING PREDICTABLE SO I'LL STOP BUT SOMETIMES I DO REGRET THAT I HAVEN'T GOT A CALL ON HIS WRISTS NOT SURE SOMETHING LONG TO WRITE SOMETHING AND YOU ARE A RARE BREED IN A WAY WHO'S HAD EQUAL SUCCESS OR GREAT SUCCESS ON THE STAGE
IN THE WRITING OF NOVELS AND OF COURSE IN NEWSPAPERS I'VE OFTEN HEARD IT SAID THAT
YOU THINK THAT THE WORLD IS INEVITABLY CHAOTIC AND THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT IT AND THAT'S THE ESSENTIAL
COMIC STARTING POINT I WOULDN'T SAY THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO EITHER HUMAN LIFE IS A LONG STRUGGLE TO COPE WITH CHAOS TO IMPOSE SOME FORMAL ORDER FOR YOU MAKE YOU CAN'T SEE THE WORLD YOU CAN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL WITHOUT BEGINNING QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY YOU ORGANISE IT IN YOUR OWN BRAIN
AND THEN TO GET TO ANY HIGHER LEVELS OF ORGANISATION LIKE POLITICAL ORGANISATION IS FIENDISHLY DIFFICULT IS ASTONISHING WHAT I'M ASTONISHES ME IS ANYTHING EVER GETS DONE AT ALL ARE YOU STILL WRITING
YEAH ABSO WRITING ODD SHORT PIECES PUBLISHED A COLLECTION A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO FOR MATCHBOX THEATRE AND SOME MORE SHORT
PIECES OF COURSE ARE PILED UP IN THE WEATHER WELL THE MATCHBOX I THINK THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE EACH OF THEM IS VERY SHORT IT'S A KIND OF A MEETING BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE SHALL WE SAY OR OR AN INCIDENT SOMETHING WHICH IS
OBSERVED SCENE BUT IT'S GONE IN A FLASH
NOW THE CASH AND SAID TO HER I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE SOUND AMERICAN LASH HE MIGHT SOUND OF MARRAKESH AS SHUSH NOT HERE SO WE WON'T BE GOING TO AMERICA YOU WEREN'T GOING TO MARRY CASH THERE'S NO SUCH PLACE IS MANIC
LISTEN I THINK YOU'RE GOING I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S MARRAKESH AND IT CERTAINLY WON'T BE MAD OR CASH I THINKING OF SOMEWHERE MORE LIKE ARE OTTLE WHAT'S WRONG WITH ROTTEN OR TYRANNY
I WOULDN'T GO TO THE OTHER ONE WHAT OTHER ONE THE OTHER ONE THAT'S ENDS ON MADEIRA MADEIRA YOU KNOW AWARE OF BATHROOM OTTOMAN WENT MAURITIUS MARTINIQUE WHERE ARTHUR AND ANNIE OH YOU DON'T MEAN MADAGASCAR WHICH DO YOU THINK THAT'S HER NATURE OF HOW WE SEE THINGS AROUND US QUITE OFF
YES ABSOLUTELY IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD IT TENDS TO BE VERY FREAKING FLASHES THAT WE PUT TOGETHER IN OUR HEADS TO MAKE COMPLETE THINGS AND ALL THE SORT OF GENERALISATIONS THE GENERAL MOVES THAT HISTORIANS LOCATE I MADE UP A LITTLE INCIDENTS HERE AND THEY'RE RICH IN WHICH THEY SEE SOMETHING IN COMMON
DO YOU THINK THERE'S STILL ANOTHER NOVEL IN THERE SOMEWHERE I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEAS FOR ANYTHING LONG AT THE MOMENT BUT IDEAS DO COME OUT OF THE BLUE NEVER NO RENT SOMETHING IS GOING TO STRIKE YOU SAY MAYBE WHEN I LIKE YOU FIVE OR SOMETHING I DARE WILL COME TUMBLING DOWN THE CHIMNEY MICHAEL FRAYN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT'S NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THE AEROSPACE COMPANY SPACE X. ARE SUCCESSFULLY LANDED A ROCKET ON AN OCEAN PLATFORM FOR PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS HAD FAILED BUT THIS TIME THE FALCON NINE ROCKET REMAIN UPRIGHT ON THE PLATFORM OR FLORIDA IT RETURN TO EARTH AFTER LAUNCHING A CAPSULE CONTAINING SUPPLIES TOWARDS THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION THE SPACE EX FOUND MOSCA'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE LANDING WHICH WAS BROADCAST LIVE ON THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY AND I THINK EVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE WERE
IT'S QUITE TRICKY TO TO LAND ON A SHIP AND IF YOU SIT IT ON THE VIDEO IN THE CHIP LOOKS QUITE SMALL
BUT IT'S THE ROCKET
SO IT'S QUITE A TINY TARGET WHICH WE WERE TRYING TO LAND ON A POSTAGE STAMP
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD MILESTONE FOR THE FUTURE SPACE PLATE I THINK IT'S ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS THE STARTERS
FOR US TO REALLY OPEN UP ACCESS TO SPACE WE'VE GOT ACHIEVE FALLING RAPIDLY
AND THERE'S MORE SPACE LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WHEN WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO THE LAST MAN TO SET FOOT ON THE MOON GENE CERNAN
IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO APED WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE WRITER AND JOURNALIST MARTIN ROWE GOOD MORNING MORNING TAKE A LISTEN TO THESE EXPRESSIONS WILD GOOSE CHASE WEAR YOUR HEART ON YOUR SLEEVE MUM'S THE WORD
THEY SHAKESPEARE OR ARE THEY SCRIPTURE WHAT ABOUT BY THE SKIN OF YOUR TEETH FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OR EAT DRINK AND BE MERRY
THIS MONTH MARKS THE FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE ONLY FIVE YEARS AGO WE MARKED FOR CENTURIES OF THE KING JAMES VERSION OF THE BIBLE NO OTHER LITERARY SOURCES GIVE US MORE OF OUR EVERYDAY PHRASES AND SAYINGS WE MAY THINK WE KNOW LITTLE OF EITHER BUT THEY SPEAK THROUGH US DAILY LANGUAGES VIRAL QUIETLY TRAVELLING CENTURIES STICKY EXPRESSIONS AND TURNS OF PHRASE GLUE THEMSELVES INTO A CONVERSATION
TRIPPING OFF A TONGUE BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN NOTICED SO HE'S A CURRENT EXAMPLE WHEN YOU SOMEONE DECIDE THE WOODS SO MUST PREFACE A RESPONSE TO A QUESTION AND IT TURNS OUT THAT EVERYONE IS ADOPTED TO PHRASE IT TURNS OUT HER RECENT VERBAL TIC FOR EXPLAINING TWISTING THE TELL YOU'RE TELLING
YESTERDAY I ENQUIRED OF A TWENTY SOMETHING IN OUR HOUSE ABOUT THE EXPRESSION BAY SPELT B. A. Y. WHICH IT TURNS OUT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BRITISH AEROSPACE IT'S SHORT FOR BABE MAYBE YOU'LL NOTICE IT NOW I'VE MENTIONED IT SO I WAS AS WE NOW SAY
AS COMMUNICATION MIGRATES ONLINE THE ACRONYM FLEXES ITS UPPER CASE MUSCLES D.I.Y. R. S. V. P. A.W.O.L. ARE ECLIPSED BY L.O.L. OWEN SHE AND G.P. W.M. THAT LAST IS GOOD POINT WELL MADE B.T. W. BY THE WAY
DOUBTLESS MANY OF THESE WILL BITE THE DUST IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THEY CARRY ALL THE STICKABILITY OF THE COCKNEY TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE WHERE JESUS MIRACULOUSLY FEEDS FIVE THOUSAND GEEZERS WITH FIVE LOAVES OF UNCLE FRED AND TO LILLIAN GISH
PURISTS CAN FIND A USE AND ABUSE OF LANGUAGE A THORN IN THE FLESH THEY PREFERRED THE ORIGINAL SHAKESPEARE OR SCRIPTURE WAS SET IN STONE BUT LANGUAGE WON'T BE TRAPPED THAT'S HOW IT SURVIVES
AND THE BIBLE WILL ALWAYS BE ONE OF THOSE PLACES WE COME FROM EVEN IF WE CAN'T REMEMBER BEING THERE EVERY TIME WE SUFFER FROM A BROKEN HEART OR RELUCTANTLY CONCEDE THAT SOMEONE WE TRUSTED AS A LEOPARD WHO CANNOT CHANGE HIS SPOTS
YES SOME PHRASES NO LONGER MEAN WHAT THEY WANTED BUT THEY STICK AROUND BECAUSE THEY RING TRUE SOMETIMES TRUTH TRUMPS ACCURACY THE GREAT JEWISH NOVELIST ELLIE WIESLAW WOULD COULD HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SHAKESPEARE OR ABOUT THE PARABLES OF JESUS WHEN HE SAID SOME STORIES ARE TRUE THAT NEVER HAPPENED
AND SOME WORDS REMAIN TRUE EVEN AS THEIR MEANING EVOLVES THE GRASS WITH US IN THE FLOUR FALLS RITTER BUT READS THE BIBLE BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURANCE AND A WORD OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE TWO
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH MARTIN ROWE POINT TAKEN BEATTIE W. TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT
SANJIV GOTTA THE OWNER OF LIBERTY HOUSE SAID THIS WEEK THAT WHAT IT WAS ASKING THE GOVERNMENT AS IT CONSIDERS WHETHER TO BID FOR A TART ARE STILL IN THE U.K. CENTRED ON ENERGY ENERGY AND ENERGY
IT IS LOOKING AT WHETHER TO CONVERT PORT TALBOT'S BLAST FURNACES TO ELECTRIC ARC FURNACES BUT SUCH CONVERSION WOULD SHARPLY INCREASE THE PLANTS RELIANCE ON POWER AND THE U.K. HAS RELATIVELY HIGH ENERGY COSTS FOR HEAVY INDUSTRY
SO IS THE STEEL INDUSTRY HAMSTRUNG BY ITS GREEN POLICIES AND ARE THEY IN DANGER OF SCUPPERING ANY RESCUE WE'RE JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY JEREMY NICHOLSON WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE ENERGY INTENSIVE USERS' GROUP WHICH REPRESENTS LARGE INDUSTRY ENERGY USERS LIKE THE STEEL INDUSTRY AND BY LORD BAKA GREG BARKER WHO WAS MINISTER FOR CLIMATE CHANGE JOINED THE COALITION IS NOW A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS
AND IS INVOLVED IN ENVIRONMENT RELATED ROLES INCLUDING BEEN PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH FELT YVETTE EGG ASSOCIATION AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING JEREMY NICHOLSON HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM ARE THESE
EFFECTIVELY GREEN TARIFFS OVERALL ON BIG COMPANIES LIKE TART OR TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRICITY PRICES HERE IN THE U.K. ARE AROUND EIGHTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE MEDIAN FOR THE E.U. WAS A HOLE AND THAT LEAVES A MANUFACTURERS ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE AND ALL OF THAT PRICE DIFFERENCE IS DOWN TO GREEN POLICIES OF COURSE BUT ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF IT IS
AND THIS IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT STARTED BRINGING IN COMPENSATION FOR SOME OF THESE VULNERABLE INDUSTRIES LIKE STEEL WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND HAVE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND YET ALSO DEPENDS AS WE'VE HEARD ALL ON VERY LARGE AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY TO KEEP THEIR OPERATIONS GOING IT'S VERY HARD TO SORT OF GET A HANDLE ON EXACTLY THERE'S BECAUSE YOU SAY THAT IN YET THERE ARE OTHER REPORTS NOT LEAST THE GUARDIAN DID A SORT OF ANALYSIS OF THE COST AND SAID ACTUALLY TATA PAYS ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION A YEAR TOWARDS THE U.K.'S CLIMATE CHANGE EFFORT
THAT'S ROUGHLY THE SAME MOTHER PLANT REPORTEDLY LOSES EVERY WEEK AND BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY THEIR BIG PROBLEM IS OVER SUPPLY OF STEEL AND ANY ENERGY COSTS PIFFLING COMPARED WITH THAT WELL HE'S QUITE RIGHT THE STATE STEEPLE HAS SOME UNIQUE PROBLEMS AT THE MOMENT OVER SUPPLY OVER PRODUCTION IN IN CHINA AND SO ON THESE ARE GLOBAL EFFECTS THAT GO WELL BEYOND THE GREEN AGENDA BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE TO SAY THAT YOU'D U.K. PLANTS ARE UNIQUELY VULNERABLE BECAUSE OF OUR HIGH ELECTRICITY PRICES THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY A PLANT CLOSURES
MORE OF AN ISSUE HERE THAN THEY ARE ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE OR FURTHER AFIELD LORD BAKA SITTING FROM I SUPPOSE THE ENVIRONMENTALIST SIDE DO YOU AGREE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS ADDRESSING IF THERE'S TO BE A CHANCE OF RESCUING NOT LEAST PORTAL BUT YES I DO AND IN FACT WHEN I WAS A MINISTER I TOOK JEREMY AND OTHER INDUSTRIALISTS TO GERMANY FAIRLY EARLY ON TO LOOK AT THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE FACT IS BRITAIN IS A SPECIAL SITUATION IN GERMANY
THEY HAVE A MUCH BIGGER INDUSTRIAL SECTOR YET OVER THE LAST DECADE THEY'VE INCREASED THEIR MARKET SHARE OF WORLD CAN THE WORLD MARKET IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE LUCK WERE EUROPE'S LARGEST RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR THE DIFFERENCE IS THEY CARVE OUT EXEMPTIONS FOR THE HEAVY INDUSTRIAL EMITTERS WHO CAN'T EASILY SWITCHIN TO LOWER FORMS OF EMITTING TECHNOLOGY SO THEY MAKE IT EASIER FOR BIG INDUSTRIAL PLAYERS TO COMPETE
RIGHT AND I MEAN IF I'VE GOT A GRAPH OF THE COSTS AND GERMANY IS STILL HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE IN EUROPE THOUGH ISN'T IT ON TERMS OF ENERGY COS IT IT MOST CERTAINLY IS FROM FOR MOST COUNTRY CONSUMERS BUT FOR THE VERY LARGEST AS WE'VE JUST HEARD THE MOST ENERGY INTENSIVE IN THE MOST TRADE EXPOSED GERMANY WHICH HAS A THRIVING MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS QUITE RIGHTLY PUT MEASURES IN PLACE
TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T SUFFER FROM WHAT'S CALLED CARBON LEAKAGE IN OTHER WORDS ALL THE GREEN COSTS APPLYING TO THEIR INDUSTRIES ARE PERSUADING MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT AND JOBS TO GO ELSEWHERE NOT REDUCING GLOBAL MISSION MERELY MERELY MAKING THEM OCCUR IN OTHER COUNTRY O.K. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY CARVE A FED UP LEE CARVE OUT THE SECTOR IS IT SOMETHING WE COULD DO HERE ABSOLUTELY NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT HER HEADING IN THIS DIRECTION BUT THEY NEED TO GO FASTER AND ACTUALLY WE SHOULD HAVE ACTED ON IT
SOONER BUT THE FACT IS THERE IS A ROLE FOR GREEN TAXES AND I'M VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO DRIVE INDUSTRY TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TO DRIVE TECHNOLOGY AND TO PUSH CONSUMERS INTO INTO GREENER CHOICES FOR EXAMPLE IT'S WORKED REALLY WELL HAVING GREEN TAXES ON CARS SO THOSE BIG OLD GAS GUZZLERS INCREASINGLY I THINK OF THE PAST AND PEOPLE HAVE NOW GOT CHEAPER TO RUN BETTER CARS INCLUDING THE CARS RUN BY CREATED BY A MASK THAT WE HEARD EARLIER
BUT THERE ARE SOME INDUSTRIES THAT SIMPLY CAN'T SWITCH AWAY FROM BEING VERY DEPENDENT ON CARBON EMITTING FEELS LIKE STEEL AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EXEMPT THEM NOTHING I DON'T HAVE TO DO CAN'T DEFIED THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND THERE'S IS IT NOT JUST TO DRY THEM OUT DRIVE THEM OFFSHORE SO WHERE'S THE RESISTANCE IN GOVERNMENT I DON'T THINK THERE IS RESISTANCE IN GOVERNMENT GEORGE OSBORNE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN VERY ALIVE TO THIS ISSUE BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHEN THE COALITION CAME IN
THAT INHERITED THIS RAIN AT THE TOLD THE RAFTER GREEN TAXES HAD BEEN ALREADY PUT IN PLACE AND IT COSTS MONEY NOW BECAUSE THE TREASURY HAVE ANTICIPATED THAT THEY'LL BE GETTING THIS INCOME SO ACTUALLY IT'S OFTEN BEEN THE TREASURY
NOT THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE WHO HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY RESISTANT TO GIVING UP THE REVENUE THEY GET FROM THESE GREEN TAXES BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD COST MONEY AND THEY HAVE TO FIND IT FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT IN GERMANY THEY CHARGE CONSUMERS MORE FOR ELECTRICITY
AND THEY CHARGE HEAVY INDUSTRY LESS SO THERE'S A BALANCE TO BE STRUCK GERMANY IF SOME DEAL CAN'T BE STRUCK THAT EFFECTIVELY CARVES OUT THE SECTOR DO YOU THINK IT COULD SCUPPER THEIR CHANCES OF A RESCUE OF PUT ALBA IT COULD AND IT'S NOT JUST THE STEEL INDUSTRY WE'VE ALREADY LOST ALUMINIUM SMELTING FROM ENGLAND AND WALES ACCENT EVEN MORE ELECTRICITY INTENSIVE PROCESS AND ARE OTHER ENERGY INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES LIKE CHEMICALS FARMER SUIT THE REFINERY
GLASS AND PAPER MANUFACTURERS CERAMICS AND SO ON THERE ARE ALSO VULNERABLE IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT BUT THE GOVERNMENT DOES DESERVE CREDIT FOR STARTING TO GET ON TOP OF THIS IN FAIRNESS A GREAT BATH AS WELL OF THOSE ONE OF THOSE WOMEN GOVERNMENT WHO STARTED PUTTING US IN IN TRAIN BUT I HAVE TO SAY THERE'S A LOT FURTHER WE NEED TO GO IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR THAT EVEN IF YOU CAN GET EVERYBODY ON BOARD TO DO THIS AND THE TRICK THE TREASURY AND ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ARE STILL NOT ADDRESSING THE REALLY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN THE STILL AFFECT RIGHT
IT'S TRUE GREEN TAXES ARE JUST ONE ISSUE IN STEEL I MEAN THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FIGURE IN THE F.T. I THINK THIS WEEK THAT CHINA HAS PRODUCED MORE STEEL IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IN THE U.K. HAS SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION SUCH IS THE HUGE SCALE OF OVERPRODUCTION GLOBALLY BUT THERE IS A ROLE FOR STEEL HERE I REALLY WANT TO SEE BRITISH STILL CONTINUED TO BE MADE HERE AND I THINK THE MISTER GUPTA'S PROPOSAL
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF EFFECTIVELY RECYCLE STEEL SO WE GET TO A MORE CIRCULAR ECONOMY TO IT SO WE RE USE STEEL IS IS A TERRIFIC ONE AND WE NEED STEEL BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE A NICE BIG INFRASTRUCTURE ROLLED OUT NOT LEAST BUILDING THE WORLD'S LARGEST OFFSHORE WIND PROGRAMME OR BUILDING H. S. TWO WARD NEW TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD BE A CRYING SHAME IF WE END UP BRINGING THAT STILL HALFWAY ROUND THE WORLD TO BRING UP BUILD GREEN PROJECTS U.K. WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE LORD BAKA JEREMY NICHOLSON THANK YOU
TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT AND JAY WHEN HAS THE WEATHER FOR US MORNING GOOD MORNING AND WE'VE GOT A BAND OF RAIN AND DRIZZLE MOVING ITS WAY EAST THIS MORNING IT'LL GET A BIT STUCK ACROSS NORTHERN SCOTLAND AND EAST ANGLIA BUT ELSEWHERE IF HE STARTS A BIT WET IT SHOULD DRY UP AND BRIGHTEN UP AT LEAST FOR A TIME BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY GOT SOME SHOWERS ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF THE U.K. ARE SHOWERS
HEAVY AND POTENTIALLY THUNDERY BIT WINTRY OVER HIGHER GROUND AND THEY'LL SPREAD THEIR WAY ACROSS MOST PARTS OF THE U.K. AS YOU GET ON INTO THE AFTERNOON SOME SUNSHINE IN BETWEEN THOSE SHOWERS NOT FEELING TOO BAD IN THE SUNSHINE BUT WHEN THE SHOWERS COME ALONG THOSE TEMPERATURES DROPPING AWAY BY SEVERAL DEGREES SO QUITE A CHILLY SORT OF FEEL TO THINGS INTO THE AFTERNOON
ON INTO SUNDAY AND HE'LL START QUITE COLD WITH A TOUCH OF FROST IT'LL BE STILL QUITE WET IN THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND AND THERE'S SOME RAIN IN THE SOUTH WEST OF THE U.K. AS WELL STRONG WINDS AS WELL AND LARGE WAVES TOO BUT IN BETWEEN THERE'S ACTUALLY QUITE A LARGE SWATHE OF PRETTY DECENT WEATHER FOR MANY PARTS OF THE U.K. TOMORROW

ROGER WALKER REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT TO DISCOVER THE IDENTITY OF YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER AT THE AGE OF SIXTY AND LEARN YOU ARE NOT RELATED TO THE MAN WHOSE NAME YOU CARRY WOULD BE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT FOR ANYONE TO TAKE IN WHERE THE CHILD IN QUESTION IS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY AND THE FATHER A FORMER PRIVATE SECRETARY TO WINSTON CHURCHILL IT IS ALSO A NEWS STORY ONE SPLASHED ACROSS SEVERAL PAGES OF THIS MORNING'S DAILY TELEGRAPH
CONFIRMATION THAT THE LATE SIR ANTHONY MONTAGUE BROWNE WAS JUSTIN WELBY HIS FATHER WAS PUT HIS MOTHER JANE LADY WILLIAMS OF ELVER WHO RELEASED A STATEMENT EXPRESSING HER ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE SURPRISE HE'S PART OF IT READ BY ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS
THIS D.N.A. EVIDENCE WITH WHICH I HAVE NOW BEEN PRESENTED PROVING THAT GAVIN WAS NOT JUSTIN'S BIOLOGICAL FATHER SO MANY YEARS AFTER GAVIN'S DEATH HAS COME AS AN ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE SHOCK
ALTHOUGH MY RECOLLECTION OF EVENTS IS PATCHY I NOW RECOGNISE THAT DURING THE DAYS LEADING UP TO MY VERY SUDDEN MARRIAGE AND FUELLED BY A LARGE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL ON BOTH SIDES I WENT TO BED WITH ANTHONY MONTAGUE BROWNE
IT APPEARS THAT THE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN AT THE TIME DIDN'T WORK AND MY WONDERFUL SON WAS CONCEIVED AS A RESULT OF THIS LIAISON
WE'RE JOINED FROM OXFORD STUDIO BY JUSTIN WELBY HIS BIOGRAPHER ANDREW ATHERSTONE AND FROM THE RADIO CAR BY CHARLES MOORE WHO UNCOVERED THE STORY FOR THE TELEGRAPH GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING TOLD MORT HOW DID THIS FIRST COME TO YOUR ATTENTION
WELL I'M SPEAKING FROM SUSSEX AND I HEARD A RUMOUR FROM NEIGHBOURS TWO YEARS AGO THAT THIS WAS THE CASE AND I FIND IT ALMOST INCREDIBLE I DIDN'T SORT OF SHUT MY EARS TO IT BUT IT WAS JUST A RUMOUR I HEARD THE RUMOUR AGAIN A FEW TIMES AND THEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR AT LUNCH ROUND HERE I MET LADY MONTAGUE BROWNE AND
THE WIDOW HIS SECOND WIFE AND HIS WIDOW SHE SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE BELIEVED
THIS STORY TO BE THE CASE AND I CAME TO SEE HER TO TALK ABOUT IT FULLY AND WE WENT THROUGH EVERYTHING AND WATCH HE'D SUSPECTED OF HER HUSBAND SHE MARRIED HER HUSBAND QUITE A LONG TIME AFTER THIS BUT SHE SUSPECTED HE WAS CONCEALING SOMETHING FROM HER
AND SHE HAD VARIOUS OTHER BITS OF EVIDENCE AND THEN WHEN JUSTIN WELBY WAS DECLARED ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY OF COURSE HE STARTED APPEARING ON TELEVISION A LOT AND PEOPLE SAID TO HER AND IT CONFIRMED WHAT SHE BELIEVED THAT HE LOOKED QUITE EXTRAORDINARY LIGHT
HER HUSBAND AND SO I WENT OFF FROM THERE I I I I CAME TO BELIEVE THIS I THOUGHT IT I THOUGHT IT ALMOST CERTAINLY
WAS THE CASE SO I ASKED TO SEE THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY AND PUT IT TO HIM PRIVATELY AND SEE WHAT HE THOUGHT AND HE HAD HEARD THE RUMOUR BECAUSE HER SON SHE'D MONTAGUE BROWN'S SON WHO'S NOT ANTHONY MONTAGUE BROWNE SON HAD GOT IN TOUCH WITH HIM IN TO THAT END OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND HEAD
RAISE THIS ISSUE AND HE HADN'T COMPLETELY DISMISSED IT BUT HE THOUGHT IT VERY VERY UNLIKELY BUT THE ARCHBISHOP IS RATHER A DECISIVE MAN AND WHEN HE WOULD SEE ME PRIVATE HE SAID
LET'S DO A D.N.A. TEST CERTAINTY CERTAINTIES BETTER THAN DOUBT AND SO I WENT AND FOUND THE RIGHT PEOPLE COMPANY CALLED NORTH JEAN TO TO DO PRODUCE THE KIT AND SO FORTH AND DO THE TEST AND I WENT BACK TO THE ARCHBISHOP WINCEY
TEST KIT AND IN MY PRESENCE HE TOOK THE TEST WHICH INVOLVES PUTTING THE SWABS INSIDE YOUR CHEEKS AND I TOOK THEM BACK AND AND FROM THE ANTHONY MONTAGUE BROWNE SIDE I HEARD ANTHONY MONTAGUE BRANDS THEIR HAIRBRUSHES THAT HIS WIDOW HAD LENT TO ME AND THEY WERE TESTED AND
THE TEST WAS POSITIVE AND SO THERE WE WERE AND HOW DID THE ARCHBISHOP REACT AT THAT POINT
WELL HE WAS VERY VERY SURPRISED AND FOR A VERY GOOD REASON WHICH IS THAT THE DATES LOOKED IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE HE WAS BORN ALMOST EXACTLY NINE MONTHS AFTER HIS MOTHER MARRIED GAVIN WILL BE UNTIL HE WAS NATURAL TO THINK THAT HE WAS A HONEYMOON BABY
BUT IN FACT WHAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN IN WHAT IN FACT LADY WILLIAMS THE STATEMENT CONFIRMS IS THAT SHE WENT TO BED WITH ANTHONY MONTAGUE BROWNE PERHAPS READY JUST A DAY BEFORE SHE ELOPED WITH GAVIN WELBY WHICH WAS JUST AT THE VERY END OF CHURCH WAS PRIME MINISTER SHIP THE DAY BEFORE SHE WAS GOING TO GO TO LADY CHURCHILL SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY PARTY
AND SHE LOOKED THE DAY BEFORE AND I THINK THEY WHO THEY WENT TO BED JUST
PROBABLY A DAY BEFORE ALSO SHE FLED THE COUNTRY AND AND SO MUCH OF THE ARCHBISHOP THIS TOOK A BIT OF WORKING OUT BUT HE ACCEPTED IT AND I MUST SAY HE WAS VERY DIRECT AND BRAVE AND
WHILE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT IT ALSO MANAGED TO SEE SOME OF THE SORT OF FUNNY SIDES ABOUT IT I MEAN I SAID WERE NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY WITH JEWISH BLOOD COS GAVIN WILL BE HER JEWISH BLOOD AND YOUR AURA
YOU'LL REMEMBER THE BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT OF BOTH SIDES OF YOUR FAMILY AND HE LAUGHED AND SAID YES IT'S BIZARRE IT WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT I WAS A BIT SAD THAT I'M NOT THERE THE FIRST JEWISH IRISH RECOUNT HAMLET HIS MOTHER LADY WILLIAMS IT'S A VERY FRANK STATEMENT THAT THAT SHE'S MADE AND IN WHICH HE SAYS THAT THIS NEWS CAME AS A TOTAL SURPRISE AND YET SO ANTI MONTAGUE BROWNE IS SAID TO HAVE TOLD HIS WIFE I AM TOLD I HAVE A SON
YES THAT'S WHAT HE SAID TO SHEILA MANY MANY YEARS AGO WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED RELATIONSHIP IN THE SIXTIES HE SAID I HAVE ONE DAUGHTER LET'S ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHTER AND THEN HE SAID AND I'M TOLD I HAVE A SON SO THERE WERE VARIOUS SUGGESTIONS GOING AROUND WHICH ANTHONY MONTAGUE BROWNE DENIED BUT HE DIDN'T
SHE HAD OTHER SOURCES OTHER REASONS FOR THINKING THIS AND SHE NOTICED THAT ANTHONY MAINTAINED A CONSTANT INTEREST IN IN IN JANE WELBY AND ALSO IN JUSTIN AS A CLOSE INTEREST IN JUSTIN WHICH SEEMED A BIT ODD SINCE HE DIDN'T KNOW HIM VERY MUCH I SHOULD SAY THAT THE ARCHBISHOP BIGGEST CONCERN IN ALL OF THIS WAS VERY MUCH NOT FOR THE STORY COMING OUT WAS VERY MUCH NOT
WHAT WILL MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE BUT THE PRESSURE IT WOULD PUT ON HIS MOTHER AND YOU KNOW WHO OBVIOUSLY HE LOVES DEEPLY AND ALSO
WHO HAD SUCH A TERRIBLE TIME THROUGH HER ALCOHOLISM WHO'S WHO'S SO TOTALLY LOOK AT IT LET ME BRING IN ANDREW ATHERSTONE BIOGRAPHER OF JUSTIN WELBY HOW DOES THIS FIT INTO THE PICTURE THAT YOU ELICITED OF JUSTIN WELBY HIS FORMATIVE YEARS
IT'S A REMARKABLE STORY AND CONNECTS VERY WELL WITH THIS PICTURE OF A DYSFUNCTIONAL SET OF RELATIONSHIPS A BROKEN HOME STRANGE GOINGS ON AND AND CONNECTIONS GAVIN WELL B. WAS CLEARLY A
A BIT OF A BULLY CERTAINLY A PLAYBOY OF SOCIALITES AND PRESSURISE JANE INTO RUNNING OFF TO AMERICA SHE WANTS TO GET MARRIED IN KENSINGTON BUT IT WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY SUDDEN AND AS SOON AS SHE'D TAKEN THAT STEP OF GOING TO THE STATES AND WEDDING HYMN BALTIMORE IN MARYLAND SHE REALISED IT WAS A MISTAKE BUT THIS PICTURE THAT'S EMERGING OF
ALCOHOLISM ON ON BOTH SIDES WITHIN THE FAMILY A DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD WHICH I THINK IS PART OF WHAT WAS MADE JUSTIN WELBY THAT THE MAN THAT HE IS TODAY IN TERMS OF HIS THERE'S LEADERSHIP QUALITIES HIS DETERMINATION AS CHARLES SAID HE'S HIS UNFLUSTERED NATURE
AND ANYTHING THAT LIFE THROWS AT HIM HE'S HE'S BEEN THROUGH WORSE THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS YOU NEVER PICKED UP ON ON THIS ON THIS RUMOUR THAT THAT THAT THAT CHILD'S MALL NOT AT ALL NO IT'S BRAND NEW AND AN AMAZING PIECE OF RESEARCH BY BY CHARLES IN THE TELEGRAPH THERE'S AN INTERESTING DETAIL THAT LAMBETH PALACE AFTER THIS HAD CAUSED TO LOOK INTO THE CANON LAW AND A LOOK AT THE RULES ON ELIGIBILITY TO BE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
THIS IS A STRANGE THING BACK IN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF COURSE SOMEONE BORN ILLEGITIMATE IT WAS SEEN AS SOMEHOW A REFLECTION UPON THEM
WHICH IS A STRANGE THING TO THINK NOWADAYS NO CHILD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAY IN WHICH THEY'RE CONCEIVED BUT THEY WERE ANCIENT CANNONS BACK IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THAT ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN COULDN'T BECOME ARCHBISHOP THANKFUL YOU'RE ALL OF THOSE RULES HAVE GONE BUT WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED IN THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS IS THAT IS THE WINSTON CHURCHILL CONNECTION SIR ANTHONY WANT TO BE I'M CLEARLY WORKED FOR CHURCHILL AS DID HIS WIDOW AS DID JUSTIN WILL BE HIS MOTHER
YES THAT'S RIGHT SO IT WAS VERY MUCH THAT THE CHURCH WILL SET HIS HIS WIDOW HIS SECOND WIFE WORKED FOR LADY CHURCHILL WENT ANTHONY WAS STILL WORKING FOR CHURCHILL AFTER CHURCH HE CEASED TO BE PRIME MINISTER WHEN HE WAS VERY OLD BUT ANTHONY BUT ALSO WORK FOR HIM IN NUMBER TEN AND THAT'S WHERE HE MET JANE WHO WAS
WINSTON CHURCHILL'S PERSONAL SECRETARY AND ANTHONY WAS THE PRIVATE SECRETARY SO IT'S VERY MUCH IN
THAT CHURCH A WORLD AND A VERY UNUSUAL WORLD IT WAS WITH THIS HUGELY FAMOUS STATESMAN VERY VERY OLD MAN AND OFTEN BEING SERVED BY A VERY YOUNG PEOPLE AND I THINK IT WAS QUITE A SORT OF HOTHOUSE ATMOSPHERE IN IN THERE IN THE MORE RACES ARE MORE RACY WORLD AND THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE IMAGINED
YES FOR I THINK VERY MUCH SO ACTUALLY A LOT OF IN A SMART YOUNG MEN WHO'D WHO'D SERVED IN THE WAR AND CONSIDERABLY YOUNGER
SMART WOMEN WHO WEAR THE SECRETARIES AND SO ON AND IT WAS A VERY THERE WEREN'T MANY
PEOPLE ARE VERY SMALL IT WAS VERY INTIMATE WAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL FLOWING AROUND AND QUITE A LOT OF THE SORT OF TENSION THAT SOMETIMES SPARKS WHOSE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE OF WINSOME SHIRT WELL BECAUSE HE'S PRIME MINISTER COS HE'S VERY FAMOUS AND BECAUSE OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY WORK HABITS SO THAT HE WOULD SLEEP IN THE AFTERNOON I HAVE AN ENORMOUS DINNER AND THEN WORK THROUGH THE NIGHT KEEPING PEOPLE UP BEING INCREDIBLY
THEY ALL LOVED HIM BUT HE WAS INCREDIBLY DEMANDING AND I THINK IT'S A SORT OF HEADY UNIQUE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH SUCH THINGS
GOT GOING AND ALSO IT WAS VERY MUCH A FAMILY SORT OF THING THE CHURCHILL FAMILY WAS EXTENSIVE QUITE A LOT OF THEM HAVE PROBLEMS WITH DRINK AND IT WAS A SORT OF ALMOST LIKE A COURT FINALLY UNDER JUSTIN AT THE ARCHBISHOP'S REACTION IS IT FROM WHAT YOU HAVE THE PICTURE YOU BUILT THAT IT DIDN'T ANYTHING SURPRISED HOW HOW HE'S RESPONDED TO THIS NEWS I THINK IT'S IT'S CONSTANT WITH THE CHARACTER THAT WE KNOW IN TERMS OF HIS UNFLUSTERED NATURE
HIS REFUSAL TO HIDE FROM REALITY AND ALSO THIS IDENTITY THAT HE HAS IN JESUS CHRIST IS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HIS CHRISTIAN FAITH IN EVERY INTERVIEW THAT HE DOES AND HAS SET AGAIN HIS DEEPEST IDENTITY IS NOT ABOUT WHICH MAN WAS HIS FATHER BUT HIT HIS HEAVENLY FATHER
EVERY MORNING I SUPPOSE IN LAMBETH PALACE CHAPEL HE'S ON HIS KNEES PRAYING THE LORD'S PRAYER OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN AND THOSE ARE THE DEEPER REALITY REALITIES THAT HE WANTS TO FOCUS UPON ANDREW ATHERSTONE AND CHARLES MOORE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT
ITALY HAS RECORDED SOME BASSETT OR TO EGYPT IN FRUSTRATION AT THE LIMITED INFORMATION THEY'RE GETTING FROM CAIRO ABOUT THE MURDER OF JULIA RIDGE ANY HE WAS THE CAMBRIDGE STUDENT WHOSE BODY WAS FOUND IN FEBRUARY ITALIAN DOCTORS WHO CARRIED OUT A SECOND AUTOPSY SAID THE EVIDENCE OF TORTURE SHOWED HE HAD SUFFERED SOMETHING INHUMAN
HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS HE WAS WORKING WITH HAVE BLAMED EGYPTIAN SECURITY FORCES BUT HE WAS A STUDENT HERE AT CAMBRIDGE FOR TEN YEARS SO SHOULD BRITAIN BE MORE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN
PRESSING EGYPT TO UNCOVER WHAT HAPPENED WELL WE'RE JOINED FROM EDINBURGH DOCKED BY DOCTOR ANDREA TETTY WHO'S DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE OF A GLOBAL SECURITY AND FROM OXFORD BY THERE ZER ARTIE WHO'S A LAWYER AND WAS A FRIEND OF JULIA ARE JENNY'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HAS HER ARTY YOU THINK BRITAIN SHOULD BE PUSHING EGYPT MORE THAN IT HAS BEEN SO FAR DON'T YOU
YES WE BELIEVE THERE YOU GET GOVERNMENT HAS A DUTY TO ENSURE THEY'RE CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION OF THIS KILLING IS CARRIED OUT AND WE THINK THAT YOU GIVE PUBLIC SHOULD BE OUTRAGE NOT JUST THE ECONOMIC COMMUNITY THAT THE U.K. HAVE A DUTY TO STAND FOR HUMAN RIGHTS GENERALLY GIVEN THE SYSTEMATIC THEY'LL ASIAN STAKING PLAYTHING NEEDED RAY NOW AND ALSO BECAUSE YOU SAID WAS A LONG TERM U.K. RESIDENT A CAMBRIDGE RESEARCHER AT THE TIME OF HIS MOTHER TALKED ANDREA TEDDY I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CASE AND YOU'VE SIGNED LETTERS
TO TRY TO GET MORE TO THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES TO TRY TO GET THEM TO INVESTIGATE IT MORE CLOSELY WHAT IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK HAPPENED TO HIM BECAUSE WE SHOULD SAY I MEAN
DESCRIBE IT SOMETHING INHUMAN THE DETAIL THAT HE'S EMERGED OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM IS JUST EXTRAORDINARILY BRUTAL THAT'S CORRECT BUT THE EVEN MORE SHOCKING THING TO THINK IS THAT THE ONLY EXCEPTIONAL THINK ABOUT THING ABOUT DRAW YOUR WAS THAT HE WAS A FINE RESEARCHER AT THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOUR IS THIS KIND OF TREATMENT IS HEATED ON EGYPTIAN DISSENTERS
ON A FAIRLY ROUTINE BASIS IN THE NUMBERS PROVE THIS OVER THE LAST NINE MONTHS AT LEAST THERE'S BEEN AN ENORMOUS SPIKE IN WHAT WAS ALREADY A VERY SERIOUS NUMBER OF CASES OF DISAPPEARANCES TORTURE SOMETIMES EVEN DEATH OF EGYPTIAN CITIZENS FROM FROM THE U.K. POINT OF VIEW AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF DREW YOU'RE HAVING A DOCTORAL RESEARCHER WHAT'S WORRYING
IS THE FACT THAT HIS RESEARCH IS ABSOLUTELY NORMAL IT'S A NORMAL TOPIC NORMAL METHODS ARE PEOPLE DOING RESEARCH ON THESE KINDS OF ISSUES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A SITUATION IN WHICH WE CAN NO LONGER BE CERTAIN ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE RED LINES ARE IN AN AUTHORITY I'M REGIME IN EVERY REGIME THERE ARE NORMALLY AREAS THAT NO GO YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN EXPECT REACTIONS BY THE REGIME BUT THIS CERTAINLY WAS NOT ONE OF THEM
WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT THE SECURITY FORCES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT BRUTAL TORTURE
I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS IN THEM THE THINGS THAT WERE DONE TO DO SO THAT THE KIND OF TORTURE THAT WAS METED OUT TO HIM ON THE ONE HAND AND THE FACT THAT HE ENDED UP YOU KNOW KILLED VERY MUCH LIKE CALLIN SAYEED WHO WAS AN EGYPTIAN CITIES AND VIEW BEFORE THE UPRISINGS
HAD ATTEMPTED TO TO EXPOSE POLICE CORRUPTION BUT IT OUT I MEAN I HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE AND NO SUGGESTION THAT JULIA WAS ENGAGED IN ACTIVISM HE WAS A RESEARCHER WHICH ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KETTLES OF FISH AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT SUGGESTS STATE SECURITY INVOLVEMENT OF SOME KIND IS THE COVER UP THAT THAT ENSUED SO WE'VE HAD A SERIES OF FRANKLY INCREDIBLE STORIES FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT AND AUTHORITY INVESTING AND AUTHORITIES
WHICH GIVE VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE AND CLEARLY TODAY OR YESTERDAY ITALY WITHDREW ITS AMBASSADOR GIVE VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE THAT EGYPT AND AUTHORITIES ACTUALLY SERIOUS ABOUT PURSUING FINDING WHO WAS IT WHO DID THESE THINGS TO JULIAN PUZZLER ARTIE FROM YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM DID HE HAVE ANY FEAR OF BEING TARGETED OR ATTACKED NOT AT ALL WE SPOKE LAST TIME RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS HE HAD COMPLETED THE FIRST
PERIODS OF FIELD WORK IN CAROL AND HE WAS VERY SPEC SATISFIED WITH HIS WERE IF HE HAD A VERY NICE COMMUNITY AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF CAROL HE WALES WHO WERE VISITING RESEARCHER THERE HE WAS VERY PLEASED HE HEATHER ANOTHER PERIOD TO COMPLETE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR FOR THAT HE WAS GOING TO RETURN TO CAMBRIDGE TO TEACH SO NOW HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR HIDDEN EXPRESSING A PARTICULAR FEAR HE KNEW HE DID REALLY WELL BECAUSE HE HELP WORK FOR THE U.N. IN CAROL
BEFORE A STAG IN THE BEACH THE EASEL SIR NO THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR CONCERN WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT BRITAIN TO DO WELL WE HAVE A PETITION THAT IS OPEN FOR SIGNATURE HAS A HOUSE
WHEN YOU CAN GATHER A LOT OF SUPPORT WE HAVE NINE THOUSAND SIGNATURES WE NEED TEN THOUSAND TO TRIGGER A RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT FROM THE U.K. GOVERNMENT AND WE THINK THAT THE U.K. MASS SPEAK UP FOR AND GET HIM TO FREE THEM AND
BASICALLY IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN STAGGERING FOR US TO SEE THAT THE U.K. HAS SAID NOTHING ON JULIUS MOTHER THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT AND JOHN KERRY HIMSELF HER SPOKEN
ABOUT YOUR YOURS BY NAME AND CALL AN EGYPT WHEN SURE CAN CONSPIRE AN INCREDIBLE INVESTIGATION THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WITH AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY A RESOLUTION ASKING E.U. MEMBER STATES TO RE EVALUATE
GUYS WITH EGYPT THE JAVA THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO CONDEMNED THE CRIME BY NAME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THANKS IN FOREIGN POLICY HAD ADVICE HAVE A BASE A REASSESSMENT OF RELATIONS WITH THE FLUGELHORN COMMUNAL OFFICE HAS SAYS THEY'RE CONCERNED BY THE REPORTS AND THEY'VE RAISED HIS CASE WITH THE AUTHORITIES AND UNDER NINE LINED THE NEED FOR AN INVESTIGATION I THINK WE NEED A MORE AND MORE A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT THAT U.K. WILL STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH EGYPT IN THE MAN THEN DRAWS FOR THIS ATROCIOUS CRIME

WE DON'T KNOW THE TRUTH YEAH WELL HE'S COME OUT TODAY
HE HAS DONE WHAT DO WE BELIEVE THAT MEANS KEPT SCEPTIC I DON'T KNOW HE HASN'T BROKEN THE LAW NO NO NO IT'S NOT BUT HE DIDN'T ADMIT IT DONE IT TODAY UNTIL IT ALL CAME OUT
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM IF THEY CAN IF THEY
PERSONALLY SPEAKING IF YOU'VE GOT MONEY A LOT OF PEOPLE DO WITH IT I THINK NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IT WAS USED FOR HIS CRITICS SAY
HE'S BEEN SAYING THAT PEOPLE WHO DO THAT ARE MORALLY WRONG HE DIDN'T DECLARE IT BEFORE HE BECAME PRIME MINISTER AND GOT THE MONEY FROM WHEREVER IT WAS RIGHT BUT ALL THE VIC'S PEOPLE DO
I THINK I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED
BY WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE TEAT AND IT DOES MAKE IT A BIT DIFFICULT FOR HER TO HAVE TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT WITH THEY HAVE SO MANY SKELETONS IN THE CUPBOARD IF YOU LIKE HE'S TELLING US THAT WE HAVE TO PULL TO TIGHTEN THE BELT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER WILL WE CLEAR NOT ALL IN THIS TOGETHER
WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM EPSOM BY THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CHRIS GRAYLING GOOD MORNING TO YOU HELLO THERE WHY DIDN'T HE SAY WHAT HE SAID ON THURSDAY ON MONDAY WHEN HE FIRST COMMENTED ON THIS WELL I THINK WHEN IT'S A MATTER THAT RELATES TO YOUR LATE FATHER AN EXPOSED FOR YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THE INFORMATION YOURSELF ABOUT WHAT YOUR FATHER'S BUSINESS AFFAIRS WERE AND SECONDLY FEEL VERY PROTECTIVE YOU GO FATHER
AND WHEN THE STORY THAT'S COMING OUT OF PANAMA IS ALL ABOUT HOW SOME PRETTY UNPLEASANT INTERNATIONAL DICTATORS ARE HIDING MONEY IN PANAMA THEN IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR A FAMILY WHERE FRANKLY NOBODY'S DONE ANYTHING WRONG TO GET LINKED TO THAT SO I HAVE EVERY SYMPATHY WHAT PER PERSON WOULDN'T WANT
WOULDN'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT PROTECTING THE REPUTATION OF THEIR FATHER I COULD BE THAT THE UH THAT'S THE INTERESTING THING IN A WAY IS THAT IT WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS FATHER IT WAS HIS OWN SALE OF SHARES THE TRUSTS THE UNITS IN THIS TRUST IN TWENTY TEN THAT HE WAS VERY TOOK FOUR FOR FIVE DAYS TO COME OUT AND SAY IT BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY MAKING AMOUNTS OUT OF A MOLEHILL IF THE PRIME MINISTER WAS MAKING INVESTMENTS TO AVOID PAYING TAX THEN HOW COME HE PAY TAX ON THE INCOME HE RECEIVED FROM THE INVESTMENT
WE HAVE TO THINK THIS IS A FROM THAT WAS REGISTERED WITH THE INLAND REVENUE FROM THE BEGINNING IT'S A BIT OF ANNUAL RETURN TO THE INLAND REVENUE EVERY YEAR AND ITS SHARE PRICE WAS LISTED IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES SO THIS IS HARDLY SOME HIDDEN VEHICLE AND THE TAX TREATMENT OF THIS ORGANISATION WAS IDENTICAL TO THE TAX TREATMENT OF UNIT TRUST AN INVESTMENT FOR US IN THE U.K. IN LONDON AND AROUND THE WORLD SO THERE WAS NO TAX GOING ON THAT'S BEEN EMPHASISED BY LEADING TAX EXPERT
IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OPERATES IN RELATION TO THAT THE AREA'S A SUPPORTER COVERED BY THE DOLL IT WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TAX EVASION BUT IN A WAY IF THAT'S ALL TRUE THAT THAT'S MAKES IT EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAT HE DIDN'T JUST FRONT UP RIGHT ON AT THE BEGINNING WHEN IT CAME OUT I MEAN IT'S TAKEN THE SORT OF PUSHING OF THE LABOUR PARTY TO HAVE LITTLE DRIBBLES AND INFORMATION THERE WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT IT'S BEEN BADLY HANDLED BY NUMBER
WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT THE LABOUR PARTY THIS TIME LAST YEAR THE LABOUR PARTY WAS HAVING TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST ACCEPTING INFORMATION FROM THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS SO THE REALITY IS THE LABOUR PARTY I THINK HE'S BEING HYPOCRITICAL OVER THIS WHAT'S INTERESTING THIS MORNING TOM HARRIS WHO LOST HIS SEAT AT THE LAST ELECTION LABOUR M.P. IF I RESPECT GREATLY IS IN THE NATIONAL NEWSPAPER SAYING THE PRIME MINISTER'S DONE NOTHING WRONG NO THAT'S A SERIOUS LABOUR M.P. NOT THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP A REMINDER YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS AT ALL BUT WE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT WE NOW KNOW IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE LABOUR PARTY PUSHING ALL WEEK
WELL WE KNOW WHAT WE NOW KNOW BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER CHOSE TO MAKE A STATEMENT BUT THIS WASN'T IT DECLARE AN INTEREST IT WAS A FAMILY TRY TO MAKE UP FIVE STATEMENTS ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT SEEMS RATHER STRANGE WELL I MEAN THE MATTER HERE FALLS BELOW THE HOUSE COLUMNS DECLARATIONS THRESHOLD HAS WITHOUT DOUBT
OH BEEN MADE IN AN ORGANISATION THAT WAS PUBLICLY VISIBLE OR SAY THIS IS AN ORGANISATION THAT SUBMIT AN ANNUAL RETURN OF THE INLAND REVENUE EVERY YEAR SO THE PROMISE PAID TAX ON THE INCOME SO THIS ISN'T SOME GREAT MYSTERY IT'S AN INVESTMENT VEHICLE THAT IS TYPICAL OF LARGE NUMBERS OF OTHER INVESTMENT VEHICLES AROUND THE WORLD AND IT WAS A HIGHLY VISIBLE THANK YOU SO JUST IN TERMS OF THE PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW SORT OF STRAIGHTFORWARD IT IS IS IT THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU
WOULD BE HAPPY TO USE HAVE USED I DON'T SORRY I I CAN'T FIRST HAVING A AMOUNTS SAVINGS BUT SOMEBODY WHO BUYS A UNIT TRUST IN LONDON WHICH IS SOMETHING VERY MANY PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS PROGRAMME WOULD DO WOULD VERY OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES IN EXACTLY THE SAME TAX ARRANGEMENTS AS THIS ORGANISATION WAS
FROM THE PRIME MINISTER'S POINT OF VIEW THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS PRETTY BAD TIMING THAT THERE'S QUESTIONS OVER HIS TRUST AND PEOPLE ARE CALLING HIM IF HE COS HE'S TRYING TO CONVINCE THEM TO VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE Y. U. WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD ARGUE FOR I WONDER IF THIS IS
GOOD TIMING FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW FROM THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN NOW LOOK I DON'T LOOK AT IT THAT WAY YES I WANT US TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION I'M CAMPAIGNING VERY HARD TO BELIEVE EUROPEAN I DISAGREE WITH THE PUNS THOMAS HE'S BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITIES CAMPAIGN ON THE OTHER SIDE I RESPECT HIM FOR IT BUT I'M ALSO A CONSERVATIVE CABINET MINISTER AND I VERY MUCH BELIEVE WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE COUNTRY AND A WHOLE RAFT OF DIFFERENT AREAS I LOOK ACROSS THE CHAMBER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO PARTY LED BY JEREMY CORBIN THAT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND BUSINESS THAT WOULD DO SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THIS COUNTRY
I WANT THEM TO LOSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP THEM AT BAY IN THE RUN UP TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION SO TO ME BAD NEWS OF ANY SORT FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS NEVER GOOD NEWS AND I THINK TAYLOR CANNOT HAS I THINK THEY BECOME HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG I THINK THE THE NOISE AROUND THIS IS WHERE UNFORTUNATE I THINK THE LABOUR PARTY WHICH HAS ITSELF BEEN EMBROILED IN OFFSHORE ISSUES OVER THE LAST TWELVE EIGHTEEN MONTHS IS BEING HYPOCRITICAL ABOUT THIS
SHOULD WE TRUST THE GOVERNMENT LEAFLET THAT HAS BEEN IS BEING SENT OUT TO ALL HOUSEHOLDS ABOUT THAT YOU USED TO BE TRUST WHAT'S IN THAT DOCUMENT WE OF COURSE I WOULD BE SAYING TO PEOPLE YOU SHOULDN'T AGREE WITH WHAT'S IN THAT DOCUMENT I THINK IT'S PUTTING OUT A VIEW OF OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT I DISAGREE WITH SO I HOPE PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT THAT AND SAY O.K. THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNMENT THINKS IT'S WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER THINKS BUT IT'S NOT WHAT I THINK
BUT THEY WEREN'T SENDING UP THE LEAFLET BUT THE REALITY IS I'M GOING TO ARGUE THE CASE OF THAT WHAT'S IN THAT LEAFLET IS NOT RIGHT THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GOVERN OURSELVES WE WILL BE ABLE TO FORGE NEW TRADE AGREEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD WITH COUNTRIES IN THE COMMONWEALTH FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE CAN'T FULLY TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH NOW WE COULD LIMIT MIGRATION INTO THE U.K. CONTROL THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COME AND LIVE AND WORK HERE AND THERE AT THE SAME TIME WOULD SAVE TEN BILLION POUNDS A YEAR OF A NET CONTRIBUTION
IT'S A STRANGE THING HERE YOU A GOVERNMENT MINISTER SAYING WE SHOULDN'T HAVE SENT OUT THIS WE SHOULD BE SPENT NINE MILLION POUNDS WHEN THE OTHERS LEAVE BUT YOU CAN'T TRUST WHAT'S WHAT'S IN IT WE FIND OURSELVES IN SORT OF VERY STRANGE TIMES AND ONE WONDERS IF PART OF THE DIFFICULTIES THIS WEEK HAVE BEEN BECAUSE OF ALL THE DISTANT BUT DISTRACTIONS ALL NUMBER TEN BEING DISTRACTED BY THE REFERENDUM
I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING AT THE MOMENT ABOUT THE REFERENDUM WHAT PEOPLE WANT IN THEIR POLITICS IS A GROWN UP APPROACH TO DEBATE IT DOESN'T WELL THEY DON'T WANT POLITICIANS HORROR AUTONOMY AUTOMATONS AND ON THIS OCCASION THERE ARE GENUINE DIVISIONS IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND IN THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE THEY WANT TO HEAR WHAT PEOPLE THINK SO IT COMES TO THE EUROPEAN UNION DAVID CAMERON ALSO WHAT HE THINKS I'LL SAY WHAT I THINK WE'LL BOTH TRY AND WIN THE REFERENDUM AND WE SHAKE HANDS AND ACCEPT THE RESULT AFTERWARDS
CHRIS GRAYLING THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WHAT IS IT LIKE TO GO TO THE MOON GENE CERNAN HAS BEEN ASKED THAT COUNTLESS TIMES HIS NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO MOON LANDING WAS NASA'S LAST MANNED MISSION AND HE'S INSPIRED A FILM IN THE CINEMAS AT THE MOMENT THE LAST MAN ON THE MOON HE SAW THE LOWS AS WELL AS THE HIGHS OF NASA'S SPACE PROGRAMME COLLEAGUES KILLED MARRIAGES AND CHILDREN AFFECTED BY THE COMMITMENT DEMANDED OF THE ASTRONAUTS I ASKED HIM ABOUT BEING ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE ALIVE WHO CAN SAY THEY'VE SET FOOT ON THE MOON

AND A. AFTER U.K. SCREENINGS OF THE FILM
THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TONIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH TO SEVEN PAGES TO ITS EXCLUSIVE STORY ABOUT THE REVELATION OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY'S FATHER THE PAPER NOTES THERE JUSTIN WELBY HAS SPOKEN MOVINGLY IN THE PAST ABOUT IS DIFFICULT UPBRINGING AFTER HIS PARENTS DIVORCED WHEN HE WAS AN INFANT THE MAN HE THOUGHT TO BE HIS FATHER GAVIN WELBY IS DESCRIBED AS AN ALCOHOLIC TRICKSTER IN CONTRAST THE PAPERS PROFILE OF SIR ANTHONY MONTAGUE BROWN DESCRIBED HIM AS A DECORATED R.A.F. PILOT TURNED TRUSTED CIVIL SERVANT
HE WAS HIRED BY BOTH THE QUEEN AND SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL BECAUSE OF HIS DISCRETION AND RELIABILITY THE PAPER'S EDITORIALS SAYS IT SHOWS THAT THE ARCHBISHOP AS EXPERIENCE WHAT IT CALLS THE DEPTHS OF LIFE AND HIS FAITH IS STRONGER AS A RESULT THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS DAVID CAMERON FACES A PARLIAMENTARY STANDARDS INVESTIGATION INTO HIS SHAREHOLDINGS THE PAPER SAYS IT CAPS A DISASTROUS WEEK FOR THE PRIME MINISTER AND NOTES HIS APPROVAL RATING HAS NOW FALLEN BELOW THAT OF JEREMY CORBIN
IN ITS EDITORIAL IT SAYS MISTER CAMERON'S REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO AVOID THE TRUTH CHANGING EXPLANATIONS FIVE TIMES IN FIVE DAYS REFLECTS THE DECEIT OF A POLITICIAN WHO CAN'T BE TRUSTED TO RUN THE COUNTRY THE LEAD STORY IN THE MAIL IS A REPORT ABOUT HOW SOME G.P. SURGERIES ARE STILL USING PREMIUM RATE PHONE LINES DESPITE BEING TOLD FIVE YEARS AGO THE CALLED SHOULD BE CHARGED
AT NO MORE THAN THE STANDARD LOCAL RATE A SURVEY FOR THE PAPERS FOUND THE DOZENS OF SURGERIES HAVE ZERO EIGHT FOUR FOUR NUMBERS WHICH COST UP TO FORTY ONE PENCE A MINUTE IT CLAIMS THAT SOME SURGERIES TELL PATIENTS THEY'LL BE FAST TRACKED TO RECEPTIONISTS IF THEY DARLA PREMIUM NUMBER FINALLY THE TELEGRAPH REPORTS THAT CAROLE MIDDLETON WILL BE LEFT IN CHARGE OF PRINCE GEORGE AND PRINCESS CHARLOTTE WHEN THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE OR GO TO INDIA AND BHUTAN IT SAYS THE ROYAL COUPLE ARE KEEN TO MINIMISE TIME AWAY FROM THEIR CHILDREN THEY'VE CRAMMED TWENTY TWO ENGAGEMENTS INTO SEVEN DAYS
THE GUARDIAN NOTES THAT DURING THEIR TRIP AVAIL VISIT THE TAJ MAHAL THE SCENE NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO OF A FAMOUS FOLLETT PHOTOGRAPH OF A SOLITARY PRINCESS DIANA WHICH FUEL SPECULATION ABOUT THE STATE OF HER MARRIAGE THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES TONIGHT ON THE PROGRAMME THIS WEEK THE FORMER OLD GREY WHISTLE TEST PRESENTER DAVID HEPWORTH ASSERTED THAT MUSIC'S GREATEST YEAR WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE THE MUSIC JOURNALIST CAROLINE SULLIVAN WASN'T HAVING IT AND ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE OF PUTTING FORWARD ARRIVAL TWELVE MONTH PERIOD OF MUSICAL BRILLIANCE
IT WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THAT POP ACHIEVED ITS APOTHEOSIS LIKE A VIRGIN TURNED MADONNA INTERVIEW A GLOBAL SUPERSTAR ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE AND HER BOY TOY BELTS WERE ON THE COVER OF EVERY MAGAZINE AND NEWSPAPER
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WAS THE YEAR OF MUSIC INDUSTRY STARTED TO SEE THE POINT OF M.T.V. AND BEGAN TO MAKE VIDEOS AS PROMOTIONAL TOOLS THEY HADN'T BEFORE VIDEOS WERE CONSIDERED A BIT OF AN HOUR ON BUT NOW THEY BECAME ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL ARGUABLY IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR M. T. V. MADONNA WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A CAREER
FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD WERE ADDRESSING SOME VERY TABOO SUBJECT FOR THE TIME RELAX WAS ABOUT GAY SEX WHICH WAS IT WAS JUST UNHEARD OF IN THE CHARTS THEN AND TWO TRIBES WAS ABOUT NUCLEAR WAR
BOTH THEIR SONG SPENT WEEKS AT NUMBER ONE WHICH WOULD HAVE LED TO MORE PROGRESSIVE ATTITUDES FROM PEOPLE AT THE TIME
GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN HAD CYNDI LAUPER AND MADONNA RACING NECK AND NECK AND FOR A WHILE IT SEEMED LIKE CYNDI LAUPER WOULD BE THE HUGE FEMALE STAR OF THE EIGHTIES BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY CAME OUT WITH A FEMINIST RECORD BEFORE MADONNA
IT WAS BASICALLY ABOUT FREEDOM GIRLS DOING WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO WITHOUT BEING CONSTRAINED BY APPARENT SAW HER BOYFRIENDS
OVER IN INDIA THE SMITHS RELEASED THEIR DEBUT ALBUM WHICH TURNED MISERABLE AS A MENTOR AND I
SO AS YOU CAN SEE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BEATS NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE ANY TIME
AT LEAST IT DOES AND CAROLINE SULLIVAN'S VIEW MAKE YOU MAY HAVE YOUR OWN VIEWS ON THE TITLE OF MUSIC'S GREATEST YEAR BUT NOBLE SUGGESTIONS PLEASE WE'VE DECIDED THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A SERIOUS WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE DON'T SEND THEM IT'S NOW FIVE MINUTES TO NINE THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID HE WILL PUBLISH HIS TAX RETURNS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IT FOLLOWS HIS FIFTH STATEMENTED AS MANY DAYS ABOUT WHETHER HE BENEFITED FROM HIS LATE FATHER'S OFFSHORE FUND FOUR YEARS AGO HE SAID HE WOULD BE RELAXED AND HAPPY ABOUT PUBLISHING HIS RETURNS
WHY HASN'T IT HAPPENED AND WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE THE FORMER LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M.P. TESSA MUNT PUBLISHED HER RETURNS THE FORMER LABOUR M.P. KITTY USHER QUIT AS A TREASURY MINISTER AFTER QUESTIONS WERE RAISED ABOUT HER TAX AFFAIRS GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING AND KITTY I SHOULD DO YOU THINK HE'S GOT A PROBLEM THAT WILL BE SOLVED BY PUBLISHING THE TAX WHAT
NO I THINK HE'S TRYING TO DRAW A LINE UNDER IT BY SORT OF GIVING THE STORY SOMETHING BY THE PUBLICATION OF HIS TAX RETURN BUT IT DOESN'T SOLVE HIS PROBLEM WICKS IS A POLITICAL PROBLEM IT'S QUITE HARD TO DEFINE WHICH IS THAT HIS FINANCIAL SITUATION DOESN'T PASS THE KIND OF SMELL TEST THERE'S SOMETHING THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE WHOLE SITUATION EITHER THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH HIM HOLDING THESE UNIT TRUSTS IN WHICH CASE HE HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM OR THERE WASN'T
IN WHICH CASE WHY DID HE TRY TO CONCEAL IT FROM US AND WHY DID HE SELL THEM JUST BEFORE HE BECAME PRIME MINISTER I SUSPECT IT WAS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO DECLARE IT ONTO THE MINISTERIAL DECLARATION OF FINANCIAL INTEREST WHICH IS FAR TOUGHER THAN THE THE BAND THE M.P.S TO REGISTER TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT THERE BECAUSE WITH EVERYBODY SAYING THERE WERE JUST ENTIRELY KIND OF BORING I THINK IS ONE OF THE WORD SOMEBODY USED INVESTMENT ANY PAID FULL TAX ON EVERYTHING
IN THAT CASE WHY DIDN'T HE SAY THAT AND WHY DID HE SELL IT THAT'S THAT'S THE SMELTERS PROBLEM AND YOU YOU YOU IN THE SITUATION THAT I'D FACED CEPT MY YEARS AGO AND WHEN I FOCUSED ON MY OWN FINANCIAL SITUATION I REALISED THAT IT WAS TECHNICALLY FINE BUT IT ABSOLUTELY DID NOT PASSED THE SMELL TEST IT WAS A MISTAKE THIS IS BECAUSE YOUR AFFECT YOUR HOUSE IS YOUR PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND IN DOING SO SAVED ON TAX YES EXACTLY WICKSY'S LEGAL LAWFUL AND SMELT DREADFUL SO I RESIGNED THAT DAY AND FRANKLY IF I CAN DO IT HE SHOULD DO IT
YOU THINK HE SHOULD RESIGN ABSOLUTELY IT DOESN'T PASS THE POLITICAL SMELL TEST AND HE'S THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE COUNTRY AND HE SOUGHT TO PUT HIS OWN FINANCIAL SITUATION AHEAD OF WHAT HE THINKS IS RIGHT AS PRIME MINISTER TESSA WHAT DIFFERENCE DID IT MAKE TO YOU PUB PUBLISHING
TAX RETURNS VERY BORING ACTUALLY SO PROBABLY NOT A LOT BUT ACTUALLY IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE WAY I FELT ABOUT THE JOB AND THAT IS THAT I THINK PEOPLE EXPECT A MUCH HIGHER THRESHOLD OF TRUST AND HONESTY AND ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR AND A LOT MORE TRANSPARENCY FROM THOSE WHO REPRESENT THAT WOULD BE THAT IN PARLIAMENT AS A COUNSELLOR OR WHATEVER
AND THEREFORE I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE IMPORTANT I PUBLISH MY TAX RETURNS AND I THINK WAS THE FIRST M.P. TO DO THAT BUT IN SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES THESE THINGS ARE OPEN TO EVERYONE EVERYBODY'S PERHAPS TAX RETURN IS ON HIS ONLINE BUT I THINK THE OTHER THING IS THERE'S THE REGISTER OF MEMBERS' INTERESTS WHICH KITTY'S ALREADY REFERRED TO BUT THE OTHER THING I DID WAS ACTUALLY PUBLISH A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL OF THE GIFTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO ME WHICH ON MULTITUDE
MANY OF THEM OF RELATIVELY SMALL VALUE BUT THEY CAN GIVE A PICTURE OF WHO IS INFLUENCING YOU AND I THINK THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THAT I WORKED AS VINCE'S P.P. YES WE WORKED HARD TO TRY AND GET SOME TRANSPARENCY OR PUSHED REALLY HARD TO GET THE OPEN PUBLIC REGISTER OF BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP SO WHO OWNS AND CONTROLS COMPANY IS
AND IN ORDER TO GET THAT SORT OF THING YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY WORK REALLY REALLY HARD AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE PRESSING TO DO WAS TO BE ABOVE REPROACH THERE DO YOU ARE YOU DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT IT DO YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE REALLY CARED ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DID LOOK COS I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY BUT INTERESTING AND IT WAS A BIT OF A NEW STORY AT THE TIME BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS I THINK THAT ONE SHOULD BE SHOULD MEET THAT HIGHER THRESHOLD IT'S SO IMPORTANT YOU DO REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE DRAGGED THROUGH THE DIRT AS HAS HAPPENED THIS WEEK WITH FIVE DIFFERENT STATEMENTS FROM NUMBER TEN
TO GET TO THE POINT WHY WHY EVADES TELLING THE TRUTH OH KITTY A SHAM IT IS STANDARD PRACTICE IN OTHER COUNTRIES NOW THIS SORT OF THING WHY DO YOU THINK IT WOULDN'T TACKLE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE SITUATION AT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER IS FACING CONCERNS HIS WEALTH HOLDINGS WEARERS PUBLISHING YOUR TAX RETURN IS AROUND YOUR INCOME IN THAT YEAR ANNIE
DISPOSALS OF WEALTH LOOKS A BIT ATTRACT ATTACKS SHARKS AND THE PROBLEM BUT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS IS THAT THERE'S AN OFFSHORE FAMILY TRUST THAT WE SUSPECT ALTHOUGH LAWFUL MIGHT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ORDER TO AVOID TAX IN THE PRIME MINISTER OWNED SHARES IN IT SO HE COULD HAVE KEPT IT AS HE CAN GIVE IT SOME SOME FORM OF TRANSPARENCY THAT SORT OF CAN BE AND WITH SUPPOSEDLY HABIT THOUGH WITH THAT WITH THE VARIOUS RECORDS THAT PEOPLE ARE MEANT TO BE SIGNING UP TO A PUT MAKING PUBLIC
THAT SURELY THAT COULD DO THE TRICK I'M PERFECTLY RELAXED ABOUT TESSA'S IDEA AND IF IF M.P.S WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT IN THERE'S VERY GOOD POLITICAL REASONS TO DIE SO GREAT I THINK THE POINT THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT THERE ARE ALREADY MECHANISMS FOR FOUR FOR DECLARING INTERESTS AND THAT THE PRIME MINISTER PUBLISHING HIS EX MARCIE TAX RETURN DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND MINISTERS AND ULTIMATELY TESSA MUNT JUST BRIEFLY PEOPLE EITHER TRUST A POLITICIAN OR THEY DON'T
WELL THERE IS THAT BUT THE OTHER THING IS DO YOU KNOW I FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SECOND JOB DONE THE INCOME TAX ATTORNEY MUSCLE TO SEALING THE BACK FOR TESSA MUNT KITTY I THANK YOU FROM ALL OF US GOOD MORNING SATURDAY LIVE IS NEXT
