THERE'S NO COORDINATION FROM THE CENTRE IN JANUARY EVERY SINGLE M. P.

THE FORMER CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE STAFF THOUGHT GUTHRIE WHO SIGNED AN OPEN LETTER EARLIER THIS YEAR SUPPORTING BRITAIN'S PLACE IN THE E.U. HAS SWITCHED SIDES HE SAYS HE WILL NOW BACK BELIEVE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS POSED BY THE POSSIBLE CREATION OF A EUROPEAN ARMY HE SAID SIGNING THE LETTER HAD BEEN A MISTAKE HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON
FOUR MONTHS AGO SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST SENIOR FORMER MILITARY COMMANDERS SIGNED A LETTER THAT STATED WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST TO REMAIN AN E.U. MEMBER BUT NOW LORD GUTHRIE THE PROFESSIONAL HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND ONE HAS CHANGED HIS MIND
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HE SAYS HE MADE A MISTAKE AGREEING TO ADD HIS NAME TO A LETTER DRAFTED BY DOWNING STREET HE IS NOW CATEGORIC FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF THE DEFENCE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM A LIVE VOTE IS BETTER HE SAYS IT WOULD BE A DISASTER TO HAVE A EUROPEAN ARMY HAS RIVALS TO NATO HE ADDS
THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY SAID THE U.K. HAS A VETO OVER JOINING ANY EUROPEAN ARMY AND NEVER WOULD
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HAS ADDED TO ITS PREVIOUS WARNINGS ABOUT THE RISKS OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE Y. YOU SAYING THE ECONOMY COULD BE FIVE AND A HALF PER CENT SMALLER BY TWENTY NINETEEN THAN IF THE U.K. STAYED IN THE I.M.F. SAID THERE COULD BE A RECESSION NEXT YEAR BUT ECONOMISTS IN FAVOUR OF BRECHT'S IT SAID THE FORECASTS USED A FLAWED MODEL HERE'S A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT THEO LEGGETT
THE I.M.F. MANAGING DIRECTOR CHRISTINE LA GARDE RECENTLY SUGGESTED THAT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON BRITAIN OF LEAVING THE E.U. COULD RANGE FROM PRETTY BAD TO VERY VERY BAD NOW THE FUND HAS PUBLISHED ITS DETAILED RESEARCH IT SUGGESTS THAT UNCERTAINTY THE LOSS OF INWARD INVESTMENT AND AFFECTS ON TRADE WOULD OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS OF REDUCED REGULATION AND NOT CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS THE E.U. BUDGET
UNDER A SO CALLED LIMITED SCENARIO IT SAYS THE ECONOMY WOULD BE ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT SMALLER BY TWENTY NINETEEN BUT IT WOULD BE IF BRITAIN REMAINED IN THE E.U. HOWEVER THIS ASSUMES THE U.K. WOULD STILL BE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET AND ALLOW THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE SOMETHING VOTE LEAVE SAYS IT WOULDN'T ACCEPT
UNDER A MORE PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO THE I.M.F. SAYS THE ECONOMY WOULD BE FIVE POINT SIX PERCENT SMALLER AND THERE WOULD BE A RECESSION NEXT YEAR THE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH A BROAD RANGE OF ECONOMIC OPINION BUT PROFESSOR PATRICK MINFORD OF THE GROUP ECONOMIST FOR BRECHT'S IT SAYS THE REPORT USES FLAWED MODELS AND MAKES WRONG DECEITFUL ASSUMPTIONS TO PROJECT DOOM AND GLOOM
PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS CRITICISED THE BAN ON RUSSIAN ATHLETES COMPETING AT THE RIO OLYMPICS AS UNFAIR AND UNJUST THE WORLD ATHLETICS GOVERNING BODY DOUBLE A. F. SAID YESTERDAY THAT RUSSIA HAD NOT DONE ENOUGH TO TACKLE WIDESPREAD DOPING TO LIFT THE SUSPENSION OF MOSCOW CORRESPONDENT STEVE ROSENBERG REPORTS
AHEAD OF THE I. W. A. S. DECISION VLADIMIR PUTIN HAD SUGGESTED IT WOULD BE WRONG TO SINGLE OUT RUSSIA AS THE ONLY COUNTRY WITH THE DOPING PROBLEM AND THAT CLEAN RUSSIAN ATHLETES SHOULDN'T BE MADE TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF THE CRIMES OF A FEW IT DIDN'T HELP THE INTERNATIONAL BAN ON RUSSIAN ATHLETES WAS UPHELD
AND REACTING TO THE NEWS PRESIDENT PUTIN SAID THAT WAS UNFAIR POSITIONING IS THROUGH WITH YOU AT THOSE NUMBER FROM WHICH TO THAT OF COURSE IT'S UNJUST RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD ALWAYS BE ATTRIBUTED TO AN INDIVIDUAL IF A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY HAS COMMITTED THE CRIME WOULD IT BE FAIR TO HAUL THAT THE HALL FAMILY LIABLE INCLUDING YOU THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S DONE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH VIOLATIONS WHY SHOULD THEY SUFFER BECAUSE OF THE OTHERS
RUSSIA'S ATHLETICS FEDERATION IS NOW CONSIDERING AN APPEAL TO THE COURT OF ARBITRATION FOR SPORT IN A SAND THE FEDERATION'S PRESIDENT TOLD THE B. B. C. HE EXPECTED MANY RUSSIAN ATHLETES TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION OVER THE I. W. A. S. RULING
THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF RIO DE GENARRO SAYS IT'S RUN OUT OF MONEY FOR PUBLIC SERVICES JUST WEEKS BEFORE THE START OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES THE STATE GOVERNOR HAS DECLARED A FINANCIAL EMERGENCY IN ORDER TO REQUEST HELP FROM BRAZIL'S FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JULIA COME ERE OWN REPORTS FROM HERE
WITH THIS DECREE THAT INTERIM GOVERNOR OFFENCES COULD THAT MAKES CLEAR THAT THE STATE HAS BROKE HE HAS REQUESTED FEDERAL FUNDS SAYING A SHORTAGE OF MONEY THE STATE OF REAL FROM HONOURING ITS COMMITMENT TO PUT ON THE OLYMPICS AND PARALYMPICS HE'S HAD SPECIAL MEASURES WERE NEEDED DURING THE GAINS TO SHORE UP SECURITY TRANSPORT AND PUBLIC SERVICES WITHOUT THESE HE SAID HE FEARED THEIR TOTAL COLLAPSE
THE STATE'S FINANCIAL SITUATION HAS BEEN DETERIORATING FOR SOME TIME AND THIS WEEK THE INTERIM PRESIDENT MICHEL DE AMIR PROMISED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AID
THE BRITISH ASTRONAUT TIM PEAKE IS ON HIS WAY BACK TO EARTH AFTER SIX MONTHS ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION A CAPSULE CARRYING HIM AND COLLEAGUES FROM THE U.S. AND RUSSIA HAS JUST DETACHED ITSELF FROM THE STATION AND IS DUE TO LAND IN KAZAKHSTAN LATER THIS MORNING HERE'S OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT PELE
RE ENTRY INTO THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE AND LANDING ON SOLID GROUND WILL BE AMONG THE RISKIEST PARTS OF TIM PEAKS MISSION HE'S SO YOU SPACECRAFT IS CURRENTLY ORBITING THE EARTH AT NINE TWENTY BRITISH SUMMERTIME IT'S DUE TO BEGIN AN ENGINE BURNED TO SLOW ITSELF DOWN AND BEGIN THE PROCESS OF RE ENTRY
AS IT ENTERS THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE THE OUTSIDE OF THE SPACE CRAFT WILL BE HEATED TO TWO THOUSAND DEGREES CELSIUS THAT THE HEAT SHIELD WILL PROTECT THE ASTRONAUTS INSIDE
PARACHUTES AND A THRUSTER AT THE LAST SECOND WILL SLOW THE SPACECRAFT DOWN BEFORE THE ASTRONAUTS LANDED KAZAKHSTAN WITH A BUMP
COLOURED GO SUPPORTING THERE THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE POLICE HAVE CHARGED A MAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEATH OF JOE COX ON NEWS CORRESPONDENT THEN UNDO THESE WITH ME AND THE CHARGES BUT YES WITH THE MAN ARRESTED BY THE POLICE NEAR THE SCENE ON THURSDAY IS THOMAS MAYOR WHO'S FIFTY TWO AND FROM BURST IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING THE POLICE CONFIRMED THAT HE'D BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER WITH GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM WITH POSSESSION OF A GUN AND POSSESSION OF AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON AND HE'LL APPEAR BEFORE MAGISTRATES IN WESTMINSTER
LATER THE MURDER CHARGE OF COURSE RELATES TO JOE COX WHO WAS SHOT AND STABBED IN THE STREET AS SHE ARRIVED FOR THAT CONSTITUENCY SURGERY ON THURSDAY THE G.B.H. CHARGE RELATES TO AN ASSAULT ON A SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MAN WHO TRIED TO INTERVENE HE SERIOUSLY HURT THE DESCRIBED AS STABLE IN HOSPITAL
MANY MORE TRIBUTES TO JILL COX OF COURSE A FUND SET UP IN HER NAME HAS BEEN DOING REMARKABLY WELL THAT'S RIGHT IT IS REMARKABLE ACTUALLY A FUNDRAISING PAGE WAS SET UP TO SUPPORT CHARITIES THAT HER FAMILY SAID WERE ESPECIALLY DEAR TO ER THEY ARE THE R. V. V.S. WHICH HAS A VOLUNTEERS WHO HELP PEOPLE WITH LONELINESS IN HER CONSTITUENCY HOPE NOT HATE WHICH CAMPAIGNS TO BATTLE HAYTON EXTREMISM AND THE WHITE HELMETS WHO ARE VOLUNTEER SEARCH AND RESCUE WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN
WORKING IN SYRIA OTHER FUNDS TARGET IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BUT IN SEVENTEEN HOURS MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE SO FAR HAVE CONTRIBUTED IN THE TOTAL WHEN I JUST CHECKED WAS JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ALREADY EXTRAORDINARY SO IT'S GOING TO GO WAY PAST THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE REALLY BIG ONES GOODNESS THEN MANY THANKS THE TIME IS NOW TEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN
THE TWO SIDES HAVE SUSPENDED ANY CAMPAIGNING IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM BUT ELSEWHERE THE DEBATE ON WHETHER THE U.K. SHOULD BE IN OR OUT GOES ON FIELD MARSHAL LORD GUTHRIE MY MOST SENIOR MILITARY FIGURES IN THE COUNTRY HAS CHANGED HIS MIND AND SWITCHED TO LEAVE ROSS HAWKINS UP OUR JOINS US NOW AND AND ROSS THIS IS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TELEGRAPH A PARTICULAR I SUPPOSE INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE HOOPLA HIGH PROFILE SIGNATORIES TO A LETTER ARGUING FOR REMAIN
HE WAS IT'S A DEFECTION WHICH CARRIES ITS OWN POLITICAL DRAMA IN YOUR VIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS MAY DEPEND ON WHETHER YOU EXCEPT MICHAEL GAVE HIS ASSESSMENT THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF EXPERTS THIS ONE WAS THE FORMER CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE STAFF IN THE LATE NINETIES
AS YOU MENTIONED THIS WAS A CHIEF WHO WAS ON THE SIDE OF REMAIN WHO SIGNED THIS LETTER A FEW MONTHS AGO IN SUPPORT OF A MAY NOW THINKS THAT'S A MISTAKE NOW HE'S ARGUING OR EUROPEAN ARMY WOULD BE DANGEROUS AND DAMAGING THAT SOMETHING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT WANTS BUT BRITAIN COULD BLOCK HE SEES IT AS A POLITICAL PROJECT
AND WHAT REALLY MATTERS HERE IS BOTH SIDES IN THE REFERENDUM OF MADE GRABS FOR THIS ISSUE OF SECURITY NEITHER REALLY OWNS IT IT'S NOT CAUGHT THE PUBLIC ATTENTION IN THE SAME WAY AS THE ECONOMY AND IMMIGRATION BUT I SUPPOSE IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE VOTE WON'T BE DECIDE HAVE A SORT OF PILING UP EXPERTS ON EITHER SIDE OF A SET OF SCALES AND SEEING WHICH WAY IT TIPS A SHIFT IN THE WAITING ON THIS MIGHT NOT ON ITS OWN
MAKE A VERY PROFOUND DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S A IT'S A HELPFUL HEADLINE A RATHER DRAMATIC ONE AS WELL FOR ONE SIDE SO CLOSE TO THE VOTE LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS SCALES WITH ANOTHER EXPERT ORGANISATION AT LEAST IN THEORY THE I.M.F. WHO'VE ALSO MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IF THERE WERE BRICKS IT AND THEY'RE MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT IN EFFECT THE DOWN SIDE THEY SAY OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE IMPACT
OF BRECHT'S OUTWEIGH TO THE UPSIDE OF REDUCED REGULATION AND NOT MAKING FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN THEIR WORDS THEIR NET ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF LEAVING THE E.U. ARE LIKELY TO BE NEGATIVE AND SUBSTANTIAL THEY RAISED THE PROSPECT OF A POSSIBLE RECESSION VOTE LEAVE US SAYING IT IGNORES THE BENEFITS
OF BRECHT'S IT NOW THOSE WHO SYMPATHISED WITH THIS SLIGHT SCEPTICISM ABOUT EXPERTS MAY THINK THEY'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE AND IT HAS TO BE SAID THEY HAVE CHRISTINE THE GUARD THE DIRECTOR OF THE I.M.F. HAS ALREADY SAID THE IMPACT OF BRECHT'S IT WOULD BE PRETTY BAD TO VERY BAD THIS IF YOU LIKE RE STATES THE SAME CASE WITH SOME FIGURES
AND ANALYSIS YOU JUST HAVE TO STEP BACK AND SAY BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN THE CONVENTIONAL POLITICAL WISDOM WOULD BE IF YOU HAD I AM F. O. E. C. T. I F. S. THIS LIST OF ACRONYMS WE HEAR INTONED YOU'D HAVE A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF BEING CLEARLY
ON TOP AND THE POLES FOR ALL OUR RESERVATIONS ABOUT THEM SUGGESTS IT ISN'T THE CASE O.K. SO WE ARE AS WE SAY HAVE CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED THEY WILL RESUME WHAT TOMORROW NIGHT WHAT WAS THE EXPECTATION OF HOW THEY WILL RIZZIO
WILL THEY WILL RESUME IN PRACTICAL IMPACT WITH THE SUNDAY MORNING POLITICAL PROGRAMMES YOU GET A FULL SLATE OF GUESS ON THOSE I THINK HUMAN DECENCY THEIR SHARED GRIEF THAT EYESORE IN WEST YORKSHIRE YESTERDAY THE SHARE CONCERN ABOUT SAFETY HAVE CHANGED THE TONE AND THEY WILL CHANGE THE TONE THERE IS LITTLE PUBLIC APPETITE I'D SUGGEST RIGHT NOW FOR POLITICAL KNOCKABOUT THE FACT THE CAMPAIGNS ONE WHOLE TODAY ASIDE FROM LEAFLETING
HASN'T MET WITH UNANIMOUS SUPPORT TEAM LEAVE SUPPORTING TAUREAN M.P.S TOLD ME IT WAS A MISTAKE ONE SAID THE MEDIA AND POLITICAL CLASS MIGHT OVER EGG THE PUDDING THERE WAS NO NEED IN THIS M.P.'S WORDS FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS OF NATIONAL MOURNING RIGHT RETURN TO NORMAL BUSINESS THEY WILL BE PRETTY SWIFT IN THE IT'S FRANKIE SO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND A LANGUAGE AND THE TOE NOW TO MATCH THE MOOD AND IT WILL BE TOMORROW MORNING IF YOU SAY ROSS HAWKINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TERM IS A QUARTER PAST SEVEN TIM PIG CAVES ARE SOON GOING TO TOUCH DOWN
COMING BACK TO EARTH HE LAND IN RUSSIA IN A FEW HOURS' TIME SARAH RINGS WITH IS OUR CORRESPONDENT SHE IS THERE AT THE SOYUZ LANDINGS ON IN KAZAKHSTAN MORNING SARAH
GOOD MORNING NOT QUITE AT THE LANDING SADLY NOT NOT MY LITERALLY STABS IT DOESN'T LEAK IT LITTLE KNOW THOUGH THAT I'M GOING AWAY AWAY MUG BUT YOU'RE THERE YOU'RE WHERE IT'S ALL HAPPENING GUYS POSEURS I KNOW IT'S BECOMING A BIT ROUTINE HOW THERE MUST BE A BIT OF EXCITEMENT
WAS I MEAN IT'S ROUTINE FOR THE RUSSIANS IT'S ROUTINE FOR FINANCE I GUESS BUT IN TERMS OF BRITAIN THIS IS NOT ORDINARY BUSINESS IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT A BRITISH ASTRONAUT GOES INTO SPACE IN FACT IT'S THE FIRST OFFICIAL BRITISH ASK YOU'RE NOT IT'S GONE UP WITH THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY WHO'S WEARING THE BRITISH FLAG AND HE'S THE FIRST ONE
ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION A LOT OF EXCITEMENT IN THAT SENSE ABOUT THIS MISSION AND OF COURSE THE FACT HE HAS HE SAYS AND HIS SUPPORTERS SAY BUT IT'S MANAGED TO REACH SO MANY CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR ARE YOU CAME WITH WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING WITH ALL THIS THESE LECTURES HE'S BEEN BILLING CUTS LYING TO SCHOOL IN THE SCHOOLS IN THE U.K. EXPERIMENTS HAS BEEN DOING
WITH CHILDREN AS WELL SO THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY THINGS HE'S BEEN UP TO YOU BUT NOW HE'S ON HIS WAY BACK AND IT'S GOING TO BE AN EXTREMELY BUMPY RIGHT HE'S COMING DOWN IN A SO'S CAPS ON HE'S ALREADY I'M DOCKED FROM THE SPACE STATION AND THEN IN ABOUT TWO TWO AND A HALF TIME IS WHEN THE REAL EXCITEMENT STARTS THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL START TO RE ENTER THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE AND PLUNGE TO EARTH IN THAT CAT'S NOT VERY FAST O.K. WHAT WHAT THE LOUD WHY PARTICULARLY BUMPY
BECAUSE CATS ALL TUMBLES AND HURTLED THROUGH THE THROUGH THESE GUYS OH I SEE IS AN EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND EVENT IT'S NOT UNTIL THE PARACHUTES ARE DEPLOYED ABOUT FRANK LOVE THOSE OFF WITH A MASSIVE JOLTS TO THAT SIZE CATS THAT REALLY IT STARTS TO FLOAT AND I THINK THAT THE ASTRONAUTS ON BOARD START TO BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF THAT ACTUALLY
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE BUT IT'S IT'S NOT PRETTY FAST AND THEY ACTUALLY HIT THE GROUND HERE WITH QUITE A THUMP I DON'T WANNA BE NICE RESTAURANTS HE'S DONE IT BEFORE THEY CAN WRITE BEFORE TOLD ME YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS LIKE GOING OVER NIAGARA FALLS IN A FLAMING BARRELS IT'S PRETTY DRAMATIC EFFING CRUMBS THAT'S SORT OF THE TUMBLING AROUND AND AROUND ARE YOU SORT OF ASSUME IT DROPS LIKE A STONE
YEAH IT DOES TUMBLE I MEAN EVEN WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WELL BUT IT'S QUITE A ROCKY RIDE AND OF COURSE THINGS DON'T ALWAYS GO ENTIRELY ACCORDING TO PLAN THERE HAVE BEEN OCCASIONS IN THE PAST WHEN EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN A SAFE LANDING IN THE END THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REALLY HAIRY MOMENTS WHEN FOR EXAMPLE AT THE POINT WHEN THE SPACECRAFT WAS MEANT TO SEPARATE INTO THREE PARTS AND JUST BELOW THE MIDDLE LANDING MODULE IS SUPPOSED TO COME TO WORK
ONE OF THE FLIGHTS IN WHICH THE CURRENT COMMANDER OF THE OF THIS SIZE WAS ON IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IN FACT ONE OF THE PARTS DIDN'T DETACH PROPERLY AND THAT WAS HIS BIT OF THE IN THAT REALLY THREW THEM OFF COURSE AND IT WAS AN EXTREMELY HARRY RIGHT THEN WE'RE HOPING TO BE A LOT SMOOTHER TODAY BUT STILL IT'S GOING TO BE FAIRLY DRAMATIC I THINK I DID THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED SO THE TIME IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN
DOES YOUR VACUUM CLEANER OUT PICK UP THE DIRT AS EFFECTIVELY AS YOU THINK IT SHOULD AND IF NOT CHIP IN BRUSSELS FOR THAT REMEMBER WHEN THE EUROPEAN UNION BROUGHT IN NEW RULES DESIGNED TO MAKE VACUUM CLEANERS MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT WELL HEADLINES ACCUSE THE E.U. OF MEDDLING IN OUR DAILY LIVES WHICH IS WHY WE'VE CHOSEN THE VACUUM CLEANERS THE LATEST OBJECT IN OUR SERIES ON HOW OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE UNION AFFECTS US ALL HERE'S MATTHEW PRICE
BOUGHT YOUR LAST FACT PHEW
WHEN YOUR WASHING MACHINE WAS FIRST DELIVERED TO YOUR HOUSE OR WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THAT NEW T. V. ON EACH OF THESE OCCASIONS THERE SHOULD'VE BEEN A STICKER ON THE PACKAGING TELLING YOU ON A SCALE OF A. TO G. HOW MUCH ENERGY THE PRODUCT USES
THAT LABEL EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE E.U. IT HAS TO GO ON A RANGE OF GOODS OVENS LAMPS HEATERS DISHWASHERS
BY LAW THE FIRST RULES ON LABELLING CAME IN IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES WHERE YOU LIKE GERMANY AND THE NETHERLANDS ALREADY HAD A VOLUNTARY SCHEME IN PLACE
DENMARK WANTED TO BRING HIM A MANDATE TREE WON THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FEARED THESE DIFFERENT NATIONAL MEASURES WOULD MAKE FREE TRADE IN SUCH PRODUCTS MORE COMPLICATED
PREVENT THE SINGLE MARKET WORKING PROPERLY SO A PAN EUROPEAN SYSTEM WAS SET UP
TO THE VACUUM CLEANER THERE ARE DIFFERENT TARGETS THAT HAVE TO BE ACHIEVED IN TERMS OF THE WATTAGE LEVEL FOR A PRODUCT TO BE CLASSIFIED AS BEING A. RATED B. RATED D. RATED THIS IS ROBERT HENNESSY HE'S THE BUYER FOR SMALL ELECTRICALS AT JOHN LEWIS TWO YEARS AGO E.U. RULES CAME IN WHICH CHANGED THE WAY VACUUM CLEANERS WERE RATED THE RULES REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF POWER A VACUUM CLEANER WAS ALLOWED TO USE BUT INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF DUST IT HAD TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP
THE RULES WERE FOR DOMESTIC AND COMMERCIAL USE INDUSTRIAL VACUUM CLEANERS AND A LIST OF OTHERS COULD CONTINUE TO USE MORE ENERGY WE ACTUALLY SAW A VERY INTERESTING REACTION IN THE U.K. MARKET TO THE INTRODUCTION
OF THIS ENERGY LABELLING WHICH WAS THAT THE MARKET POLARISED THERE WAS A RUN ON IF YOU LIKE LEGACY PRODUCT WHICH HAD TO BE OLD
AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER BREED OF CUSTOMER GRAVITATED TO THE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS THAT'S REMAINED TO THIS DAY THE BRANDS NOW HAVE RESPONDED TO THAT BY PRODUCING
TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRODUCTS AIMED AT THOSE TO DIFFERENT AUDIENCES
I DO THIS IT'S ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT THE COUNTRIES OF THE E.U. SET THEMSELVES A COLLECTIVE TARGET TO INCREASE ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY TWENTY PERCENT BY TWENTY TWENTY AND TO ACHIEVE IT
STARTED TO BAN THE LEAST ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS IT'S NOT JUST VACUUM CLEANERS REMEMBER THE LIGHTBULB RAIL THAT BEN CAME IN BECAUSE SEVERAL COUNTRIES FRANCE ITALY IRELAND AND BRITAIN
WE'RE CONSIDERING BANNING INCANDESCENCE BULBS OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE WASHING MACHINES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO TIGHTER RULES ON ENERGY USE FOR A WHILE NOW AND THAT'S HAD AN IMPACT ON THE MACHINES ON SALE IN OUR SHOPS
INITIALLY CUSTOMERS DRIVEN EITHER BY AN ENERGY SAVING CRITERIA OR YOU DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE PANIC CRITERIA GRAVITATED TOWARDS
MORE AND MORE A. RATED PRODUCTS THE BRAND'S RESPONDED BY PRODUCING MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS
SOME SAY THE TESTS PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE ENERGY USE OF THE VACUUM CLEANERS ARE MISLEADING OTHERS THAT THE ASSESSMENTS FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ENERGY INVOLVED IN MAKING VACUUM CLEANER BAGS WHICH THEY SAY MAKES MORE POWERFUL BAGLESS MODELS MORE EFFICIENT OVERALL
THERE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL ARGUMENTS BOTH WAYS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BAGS THEY GO INTO LANDFILL EVERY YEAR CLEARLY THAT IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL COST THERE ISN'T CURRENTLY REFLECTED
LEGISLATION THERE'S ALSO ARGUMENTS THERE WHEN OUR PRODUCT IS FULL OF DUST IT'S EFFICIENCY DROPS AND THE MEASUREMENT OF A FISH AND SEA IS ONLY MEASURES ON EVENTING PRODUCT WHERE'S ALL THIS GOING
EUROPEAN COMMISSION HASN'T ANNOUNCED ANYTHING YET BUT OTHER DOMESTIC APPLIANCES LIKE HAIRDRYERS TOASTERS AND SO ON SEEM LIKELY CANDIDATES IN THE FUTURE FOR TIGHTER RULES ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY
SOME CALL THAT BRUSSELS MEDDLE IN YOUR DAILY LIVES OTHERS ARGUE IT'S FOR THE COLLECTIVE GOOD
POINT TO THE FACT THAT A HUGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY IS BEING SAVED
MATTHEW PRICE REPORTING IT'S NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS THE BAN ON RUSSIAN ATHLETES COMPETING IN THE RIO OLYMPICS IS UNFAIR AND UNJUST INTERNATIONAL ATHLETICS FEDERATION SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT WOULD NOT BE LIFTING THE SUSPENSION THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NOVEMBER BECAUSE OF WIDESPREAD DOPING ROBERT SERVICE IS AMERICA'S PROFESSOR OF RUSSIAN HISTORY AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY A LITTLE EARLIER I ASKED HIM WHAT EFFORTS THE RUSSIANS HAD MADE TO CLAMP DOWN ON DRUG USE
I THINK THAT THEY WERE MOVING IN RUSSIA HAVE TOWARDS CONTROLLING WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE RUTHLESS MEASURES THAT WERE NECESSARY I MEAN BACK IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE SOVIET UNION THEY WERE STARTING TO ACT KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS
THERE WAS HUGE CHEATING GOING ON SYSTEMATICALLY IN THE SOVIET UNION IN THE LAST YEARS OF THE SOVIET UNION AND
THERE WAS A SORT OF BLANKET ON THE WHOLE OF THAT THAT WAS LOWERED ON THE WHOLE OF THAT AND
THE RUSSIANS IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS RUSSIAN OFFICIALS IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS ADMITTED THAT IT WAS STILL GOING ON AND ACTUALLY THAT IT WAS GOING ON ON A MASSIVE SCALE
AND AND THEY DIDN'T THOROUGHLY IMPOSE A PURGE ON
THE THAT THE CHEATING AND NOW THEY'RE PAYING THE PRICE THERE AND THE CHEATING TO THINK IT WAS DOWN TO INDIVIDUALS OR WAS THERE SOME PERHAPS HIGHER UP THE SCALE SOME ORCHESTRATION OF IT TO ENSURE SUCCESS
WELL I WOULD AGAIN GO BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE BEFORE GO MATURE OFF FELL FROM POWER THERE WERE LOTS OF ARTICLES IN THE PRESS
IN THE FREE PRESS HAVE THOSE DAYS ACKNOWLEDGING
EXACTLY HOW HIGH UP THE POLITICAL SYSTEM THIS CON DRONING OF CHEATING WENT ON BLOOD DOPING AND ALL THE REST OF IT
IT REALLY WENT ON SYSTEMATICALLY THROUGHOUT THE THE SPORTING ESTABLISHMENT PROBABLY NON DA'S SYSTEMATICALLY AS SAY IN EAST GERMANY BUT BECAUSE OF THE
THE AMOUNT OF PRESTIGE THAT WAS ATTACHED TO RUSSIAN SOFT POWER AMONG AROUND THE WORLD
WHEN PUTIN CAME TO POWER BECAUSE OF THAT SPORT WAS LIKE AN ARM OF THE STATE AND I'LL MOVE RUSSIA'S GLOBAL AUTHORITY AND THE BLIND I WAS
TURNED TO THIS TERRIBLE PHENOMENON SOMEONE IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAS SUGGESTED THAT IT STEMS FROM SOVIET RUSSIA WHEN THE ONLY WAY TO GET AHEAD WAS TO CHEAT DO YOU BUY INTO THAT THINKING
IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE THAT IF IF YOU WANTED TO GET ON IN THE SOVIET UNION AND YOU CAME FROM A SMALL LITTLE VILLAGE OR A TINY LITTLE TOWN AND YOU WERE A SUPERB ATHLETE THEN
YOU WERE MADE FOR LIFE YOU RAN AWAY YOU'D JUMPED OR YOU SWAM FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS AFTER THAT ACTUALLY YOU'VE GOT SOME SORT OF PENSION OR SOME EASY
PROFESSIONAL SINECURE AND THAT WILL CARRY YOU THROUGH TO THE END OF YOUR DAYS AND YOU WOULDN'T JUST BE LIVING IN YOUR LITTLE VILLAGE
YOU'D BE LIKE THE COSMONAUTS ALL THEIR GREAT WRITERS YOU HAD YOU'D BE JETTED UP TO THE TOP ROCKETED UP TO THE TOP OF THE CISTERN AND PUTIN BROUGHT THAT BACK PROFESSOR ROBERT SERVICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IN THE TIME HE'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SEVEN OUT HERE'S CHRIS WITH THE SPORT MORNING JOHN LET'S STAY WITH THE RUSSIAN SUSPENSION FROM THE OLYMPIC GAMES BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LARGELY POSITIVE REACTION BY BRITISH ATHLETES TO THE DECISION BY THE DOUBLE A. F. FORMER SPRINTER DARREN CAMPBELL SAYS IT'S A START AT LEAST TO THE PROCESS OF RESTORING PUBLIC FAITH IN THE SPORT AND HERE'S THE VIEW OF THE EUROPEAN FOUR HUNDRED METRE CHAMPION MARTYN ROONEY
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I'M VERY HAPPY THAT THE OF BETH HAVE SHOWN SOME STEEL AND MAKE STUCK TO THEIR GUNS I THINK THAT'S FOR A LOT OF ATHLETES IN MY MEDALS IN THE PAST BECAUSE OF RUSSIAN MUNCHED OPEN I THINK IT'S
IT'S POPULAR DECISION AND GOALIE SAYS THE BRITISH JAVELIN RECORD HOLDER WILL BE A STUDIO GUEST IN AN HOUR'S TIME YOU ARE TWENTY SIXTEEN CONTINUES TO PRODUCE DRAMA BOTH ON AND OFF THE PITCH UEFA HAS LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION AFTER FLARES AND PUNCHES WERE THROWN DURING CROATIA'S TWO ALL DRAW WITH THE CZECH REPUBLIC ITALY AND SPAIN HAVE BOTH QUALIFIED FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN AFTER VICTORIES OVER SWEDEN AND TURKEY RESPECTIVELY

WITH ALL THE TERRITORY AND POSSESSION THEY HAD AND WITH THE GREAT STAR THEY HAD THEY JUST SLIPPED OFF AND ALLOWED ENGLAND BACK IN BUT I GUESS I'M THINKING THAT WAS BECAUSE WELL I KNOW THAT WAS ENGLAND'S PRESSURE IN DEFENCE BUT THE AUSSIES AT HOME WILL STILL BE DIFFICULT AND IF THEY CAN ERADICATE THOSE
SILLY SLOPPY PENALTIES THAT THEY GAVE AWAY THEN THEY GOT A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING THIS ONE YES GEORGE FORD AND OWEN FARRELL BOTH IN THE SIDE ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER IS THAT THE RIGHT MOVE FOR YOU

TRYING TO GET CANCELLED FOR MANY MANY REASONS TRAINS GET CANCELLED TO TO BALANCE THE SERVICE LATER ON THAT OF COURSE YOU SHOULDN'T SAY TO PEOPLE IT'S BEEN CANCELLED BECAUSE OF A SHORTAGE OF TRAINED CREW WHEN YOU'VE ACTUALLY CANCELLED IT SO THEY'D MANAGED TO SERVICE LATER ON SO IF YOU DID SAY IT WAS A SHORTAGE OF TRAINED CREW THAT WOULD BE UNTRUE SO IN IN THE LAST FOUR WEEKS WE WE'VE HAD A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CANCELLATIONS BECAUSE OF SHORTAGE OF TRYING CRAIG THAT IS A FACT
WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW BY CAROLINE PIGEON WHO'S THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT CHAIR OF THE TRANSPORT COMMITTEE ON THE LONDON ON THE GREATER LONDON ASSEMBLY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WE HEARD THE CHANTING THAT SOUTHERN OUT WHICH IS THE SORT OF FRANCHISE HOLDER OF THIS PART OF GOBBY A THAMES LINK RAILWAY DO YOU THINK THAT IS THE ANSWER
I THINK THAT IS PART OF THE ANSWER WE'VE GOT TO DO IS START TO SEE MORE RAIL SERVICES BEING DEVOLVED TO LOCAL AREAS AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS A SOUTHERN FRANCHISE SPLIT SO THAT THE METRO SERVICES RUN IN LONDON AND JUST OUT INTO IT INTO PLACE LIKE KENT COULD COME UNDER TRANSPORT FOR LONDON COMMANDER THE MAYOR OF LONDON AS WE'VE SEEN SO SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE LONDON OVERGROUND WHICH WAS SILVER LINK ROUTE IT WAS DEVOLVED TO KEN LIVINGSTONE ACTUALLY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
WE'VE SEEN AN EIGHTY PERCENT INCREASE IN PASSENGERS ON THAT WE'VE SEEN INVESTMENT IN RAIL STOCK WE'VE SEEN MORE FREQUENT SERVICE AND THAT'S WHAT PASSENGERS WANT THEY WANT SOMETHING RELIABLE AND JUST HEARING FROM THE COMMUTERS IN YOUR PIECE I'VE BEEN THERE I'M A COMMUTER MYSELF I KNOW THE PAIN PEOPLE SUFFER SO HOW WOULD IT WORK WOULD TAKE CONTROL OF WHAT THEY WERE TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR SERVICES IN LONDON IT WOULDN'T HELP YOUR PASSENGERS IN BRIGHTON BUT IT MEAN THAT SOUTHERN OR WHOEVER WAS RUNNING IT COULD FOCUS ON THOSE LONGER DISTANCE SERVICES BUT WHAT WE NEED TO SEE
IS METRO SERVICES ACROSS LONDON BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND RUN BY TRANSPORT FOR LONDON AND THEY RUN IT IN A SECOND IT ARE YOU SAYING IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE FOCUS AT THE MOMENT IS THE BRIGHTON ROCK THE BRIGHTON LINE IS CLEARLY WHERE WE'RE SEEING HUGE ISSUES BUT ACTUALLY RIGHT ACROSS SOUTHERN SERVICES EVEN WHERE WE DON'T HAVE CONDUCTORS ON THE LINE WE ARE SEEING HUGE ISSUES
I TRAVEL IN EVERY DAY AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS TRAINS CANCELLED BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T GOT DRIVERS AND WHY HAVE WE NOT GOT DRIVERS COS THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH DRIVERS TO RUN THEIR TIMETABLE WITHOUT RELYING ON THEM TO USE ALTHOUGH YOU'RE KNOW THAT THERE IS ALL SORTS OF ACCUSATIONS MADE IN THIS NOT LEAST BY THE COMPANY WHO RELEASED A GRAPH YESTERDAY SHOWING THE NUMBER OF CONDUCTORS WHO'VE BEEN OFF SICK SINCE THEN
FIRST STRIKE WHICH IS WHY THEY SAY THAT EFFECTIVELY IT'S WORKING TO RULE AND IT'S OUTRAGEOUSLY UNFAIR IS COMPLETELY HALF A DOZEN OF ONE IN SIX OF THE OTHERS IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S QUITE OUTRAGEOUS THAT YOU SEE SO MANY AND CONDUCTORS GOING ON STRIKE YOU SEE SEVENTY FOUR CONDUCTORS HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE SIX DAY OVER RECENT WEEKS THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF SICKNESS SHE SHOULD BE HAVING HUGE MANAGEMENT ENABLING REUNION AS WELL I WAS ABSOLUTELY BUT THE COMPANY DON'T MATCH YOU HAVE IT'S NOT JUST THE CONDUCTOR MIXTURE WHICH IS SENSITIVE
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DRIVERS ABLE TO RUN THEIR TIMETABLE BUT THE INTERESTING THING HERE IS THAT THIS IS A MANAGEMENT CONTRACT IT DOESN'T RUN AS ONE OF THE RAILWAYS IN THE COUNTRY RUN THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT SAYING THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO THERE ARE SOME WHO DEFEND THE COMPANY SAKE THEY'RE ONLY DOING WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN TASKED TO DO AND THEY ARE BEING PAID TO DO AND IN FACT WHAT IS HAPPENING ELSEWHERE ON THE NETWORK NOW KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING IS RECRUITING EVEN MORE DRIVE
THEY'VE GOT TO DO WITH THIS CONDUCTOR OR SHAN THAT'S THE ISSUE WITH GOVERNMENT BUT WHEN I HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH THEM IT TAKES TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO TRAIN UP A DRIVER TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE TRAINS ON THE NETWORK YOU COULD BE PLANNING LOTS IN ADVANCE TO DO THAT WHILST THEY TELL ME THEY'VE HAD NINETEEN NEW DRIVERS THIS YEAR WE'VE STILL GOT PROBLEMS OR TRAINS BEING COUNTS AND THE PROPOSAL THAT T.F. ETHELBERT AFFECTION FOR THE NATIONALISATION OF THE RAIL NETWORK THERE IS
REMARKABLY BROAD POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THAT ISN'T THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS TO HEAD IN THAT DIRECTION WELL THIS IS WHAT THE DIFFERENCE THE TRANSPORT FOR LONDON RUNNING IT IS THIS IS A MODEL IT'S NOT I'M NATIONALISING IT'S NOT RUN BY THE STATE BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE A RAIL CONCESSION MODEL WHICH MEANS THAT TRANSPORT FOR LONDON TAKES THE RISK IN TERMS OF FAIRS THEY TAKE ALL OF THE FARES BUT THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH A COMPANY A RAIL COMPANIES TO RUN THE TRAINS TO CERTAIN SERVICE LEVEL AND THAT INCLUDES FULLY STAFFED STATIONS WE'RE NEVER TRAINS ARE RUNNING
IT MEANS INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OF TRAINS AND LONGER TRAINS AND WHAT YOU SEE IS PASSENGER SATISFACTION GOING UP AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS WHEN WE DID A SURVEY ON THE LONDON ASSEMBLY OF RAIL PASSENGERS SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT OF PASSENGERS AND THIS WAS LAST YEAR SUPPORTED DEVOLUTION OF RAIL TO TRANSPORT FOR LONDON SO IT REALLY IS A MODEL THAT WORKS AND WE SEE IT ROUND NORTH ARE LOOKING AT MOVING DOWN THIS MODEL WORKS FOR EVERY PART OF THE U.K. I'M PIGEON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS ON THE DEATH OF JOE COX MAKES THE LEAD FOR ALL OF THEM AGAIN MOST OF THE FOCUSING ON THE POLICE INVESTIGATION AND BEFORE HE WAS CHARGED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING THE SUSPECT'S BACKGROUND THE TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE SECURITY OF FEMALE M.P.S IT SAYS THE KILLING HAS LED MANY POLITICAL OBSERVERS TO HIGHLIGHT THE INCREASINGLY VICIOUS ABUSE TO WHICH THEY A SUBJECT PARTICULARLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA
THE MIRROR'S FRONT PAGE IS TAKEN UP WITH A PICTURE OF MISSUS COX'S CHILDREN HOLDING ON TO HER DURING A DAY OUT TOGETHER IT'S ACCOMPANIED BY THE HEADLINE POLITICIAN HUMANITARIAN CAMPAIGNER DAUGHTER WIFE
MUM PICTURES ELSEWHERE SHOW THE M. P. PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH HER YOUNG SON IN HER WEDDING GOWN TALKING TO PUPILS AT A SCHOOL SHORTLY BEFORE THE ATTACK AND WITH HER PERSONAL ASSISTANT WHO COMFORTED HER IN HER DYING MOMENTS THE SUN REPORTS THAT MISSUS COX'S HUSBAND BRENDAN IS BEING URGED BY POLITICAL FRIENDS TO STAND AS AN M.P. IN THE SEAT OF THAT SHE HAD HELD
ACCORDING TO THE SUN MISTER COX OF FORMER LABOUR SPECIAL ADVISOR WHO HAS BEEN AN ACTIVIST SINCE HIS STUDENT DAYS IS SEEN AS THE PERFECT REPLACEMENT FOR THE BASTION SPEND CONSTITUENCY WHAT DOES THE MURDER OF JOE COX MEAN FOR THE STATE OF POLITICS AND DEMOCRACY IT'S A QUESTION THAT EXERCISES MANY MINES FOR THE TELEGRAPH DEMOCRACY MUST CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AND BE SEEN TO FUNCTION ITS DURABILITY IS ONE OF ITS GREATEST STRENGTHS THE PAPER SAYS ADDING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR HAS NOT STOPPED IT BEFORE AND MUST NOT APPEAR TO DO SO NO
IN THE WORDS OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES IT'S VITAL THAT THE TRADITION OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IT UPHELD IT SAYS THE LINK BETWEEN M.P.S AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS MUST NOT BE DESTROYED THE TIE EMMA'S SPELLS WHERE IT STANDS IN THE REFERENDUM TODAY IT'S FRONT PAGE BAMA DECLARES WILD REMAIN IS BEST FOR BRITAIN EXPLAINING US DISSIDENT A FULL PAGE ARTICLE THE PAPER SAYS LEAVE WOULD BE A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE EUROPEAN PROJECT SO SHATTERING BUT IT WOULD ROCKET TO THE CORE WITH A KNOWN AND POSSIBLY ALARMING CONSEQUENCES
THE TIMES WAS THAT A WIN FOR REMAIN IT CANNOT BE FOLLOWED BY BUSINESS AS USUAL BRITAIN MUST LEAD A RENEWED DRIVE FOR REFORM EARLIER THIS WEEK THE TIME STABLEMATE THE CERTAIN AND I SAID IT WAS SUPPORTING VOTE LEAVITT SAID THAT OUTSIDE THE E.U. BRITAIN WOULD BECOME RICHARD SAFE AND FREE AT LONG LAST A FORGER FILM DESTINY THE TIME IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD IS ONE OF THIS COUNTRY'S BEST SELLING WRITERS SHE SOLD OVER EIGHTY FIVE MILLION BOOKS FOR DATE SHE'S EIGHTY THREE NOW SHE STARTED HER WORKING LIFE AS A REPORTER AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN SHE IS THE LATEST SUBJECT AND UP MEET THE AUTHOR SERIES AND JIM HAS BEEN TALKING TO YOU ABOUT FAMILIES CLASS AND WOMEN WARRIORS
VERY FEW AUTHORS HAVE SOLD AS MANY BOOKS AROUND THE WORLD AS BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD A GRANDE DAMME OF THE FAMILY SAGA HER LATEST JUST PUBLISHED IS THE THIRD VOLUME IN A SERIES ABOUT THE CAVERN D'UN FAMILY YORKSHIRE ARISTOCRATS AND SPINS A STORY SET AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF WAR STARTING IN THE LAST YEAR OF PEACE NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT AND ENDING AFTER V. E. DAY
THE CAVERN D'UN LUCK TELLS OF INTERLOCKING FAMILIES WHOSE LIVES ARE CHANGED FOREVER BY CONFLICT I'LL BE SAT DOWN I ASKED HER WHY SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THAT READERS WERE STILL DRAWN TO STORIES LIKE THESE PEOPLE ARE FASCINATED BY OTHER PEOPLE AND HOW THEY BEHAVE IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AND THERE'S NO MORE DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE THEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A BIG FAMILY
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOD JUST FREE FLOATING EMOTIONS LOVE JOY HAPPINESS ANGER CHECK HELLER'S SEE IT'S ALSO INTERESTING THAT THE PRINCIPAL FAMILY HERE IS ONE WHICH IS
ARISTOCRATIC IT'S IT'S QUITE GRAND THEY COULD LIVE IN DENTON HAPPY I SUPPOSE AND YET READERS SEEM TO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THOSE FAMILIES AND INHABIT THEIR THEIR MINDS AND THEIR THEIR HABITS AND THEIR DOINGS
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM MOST PEOPLE'S LIVES I THINK IT'S ESCAPISM TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH SOME OF MY BOOKS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS ESCAPISM BUT OF COURSE THEY ARE
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF HISTORY AND WHAT I FOUND WHEN I WAS DOING THE RESEARCH GEMMA'S I WAS TERRIBLY MOVED BY THE CARRIAGE OF THE ORDINARY BRITISH PERSON MEN RESCUING THE BOYS FROM THE BEACHES AND DUNKIRK THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE THEY WERE STARTED IMAGE AND THEN JUST TO GIVE COUNTRY WOMEN SOME PLACE TO MEET TWICE A MONTH AND TO HAVE A BIT OF SOCIAL LIFE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TELEVISION AND RADIO AND ALL OF THAT BUT DURING THE WAR
THEY MADE MILLIONS HAVE BOTTLES OF JAM THEY BOTTLE FRUIT THEY HAD A LOT OF MEN STAY REALLY FED THE COUNTRY OR YOU KNOW OTHER SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING ABOUT THAT PERIOD IN THAT TERRIBLE TRAGEDY WAS VISITED ON MANY FAMILIES BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE THE WAR YEARS WERE ALSO YEARS OF OPPORTUNITY THERE IS ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN THAT END AND IN THOSE WAR YEARS A FOR INSTANCE WE WERE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAD RADAR
THOSE RAIDING MACHINES WERE MOSTLY OPERATED BY WOMEN AND YOU KNOW THEY WANTED TO FLY BUT NO THEY WERE ON AIR BASES NO THEY HAD TO DO THE RADAR WELL IT'S INTERESTING YOU MENTION WOMEN IN TERMS OF THE WAR EFFORT YOU WERE QUITE A PUSHY YOUNG WOMAN AND YOUR TIME WHEN YOU BECAME A REPORTER IN YORKSHIRE WHERE YOU WERE BORN AND BROUGHT UP YOU BECAME WOMEN'S EDITOR OF THE AT EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD GOING IN THOSE DAYS YES I WAS
TWENTY WHEN I CAME TO WORK IN FLEET STREET ON A WOMAN'S MAGAZINE AND THEN I WENT TO WORK ON THE LONDON EVENING NEWS THAN OTHER NEWSPAPERS AND I STILL CONSIDER MYSELF A JOURNALIST AND I REMEMBER MY FIRST NEWS EDITOR SAYING TO ME AND I WAS SIXTEEN BY THEM THERE'S ONE SENTENCE I WANT YOU TO MEMORISE HER NO
WHERE WHEN AND WHY AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT MY BOOK STAR YOU'VE BEEN WRITING ALL YOUR LIFE HAVEN'T YOU YES YOU STARTED AT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AS A REPORTER AND YOU STRIKE ME AS SOMEONE
WHO REALLY CAN'T GET THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT DOING A LITTLE BIT OF WRITING I DO WHEN I'M WRITING A BOOK GARAGE EVERY DAY I ACTUALLY SPEND ABOUT TEN HOURS A DAY AND AND MY
A LITTLE LIBRARY WE HAVE IN OUR APARTMENT IN NEW YORK WHICH IS FULL OF BOOKS AND MY TYPEWRITER BUT I'D BETTER AND I WAS WITH MICHAEL DOBBS THE OTHER DAY WAS SOME MUTUAL FRIENDS AND HE SAID SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NEVER SAID TO ANYBODY AND HE LOOKED AT ONE OF THE GUESTS AT THIS DINNER AND HE SAID
PEOPLE WHO DON'T WRITE CIVILIANS I CALL THEM SAYS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
MUCH WORK IT IS AND HOW HARD THE WORKERS AND I'VE NEVER SAID THAT TO ANYBODY BUT IT IS TRUE I HAVE TO SAY YOU SEE I'M NOT WRITING TEN HOURS THERE SOMETHING CALLS THINKING IT OUT THINKING OF THE PLOT WHAT ARE THEY CHARACTERS LIKE WHAT ARE THEIR TRAIT I'M JUGGLING
BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
AND AT FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S NOW TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A CARDIFF STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND ROY JENKINS WHO'S BAPTIST MINISTER THERE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SHE WOKE UP EVERY DAY AND SAID HOW CAN I CHANGE THE WORLD RECALLED A COLLEAGUE
JOE COX WE'RE TOLD CRACKLED WITH ENERGY FIZZED WITH LIFE WITH TIME FOR EVERYONE THE RISING STAR WHO'LL FORK WITH PASSION FOR THE WORLD'S NEEDY EST REMAINED ROOTED IN HER OWN PEOPLE AT A MURDER WAS SO UNEXPECTED SO SHOCKING THAT IT'S LITTLE WONDER THAT THOSE OF US WHO NEVER KNEW HER HAVE SHARED THE STUNNED GRIEF OF ALL WHO DID
WE MIGHT WISH THAT WE'D ENCOUNTERED THAT SPIRIT FOR OURSELVES THROUGH MORE THAN THE TEAR LADEN TRIBUTES
THOSE TRIBUTES MIGHT INDEED INSPIRED US BUT THEY COULD ALSO UNINTENTIONALLY BE PRETTY DAUNTING FOR SOME OF US
CHANGING THE WORLD'S A GREAT IDEA THERE'S SO MUCH WE'D LIKE TO SEE PUT RIGHT BUT WE'RE NOT ALL GIFTED WITH EXTRAORDINARY VIGOUR AND VISION COULD BE TOUGH ENOUGH JUGGLING OUR WAY TO THE MUNDANE BUSINESS OF EACH DAY AND THE WORLD AND ITS PROBLEMS CAN SEEM MORE THAN A BIT BEYOND US
IN REALITY THOUGH WE ALWAYS FACE OPTIONS ON THIS AT ITS SIMPLEST WE CAN'T FEED A BILLION HUNGRY PEOPLE BUT WE CAN MAKE A LIFE OR DEATH DIFFERENCE TO A FUEL AND LOBBY THOSE WITH MORE POWER TO MAKE A BIGGER DIFFERENCE
WE CAN'T FREE EVERY PRISONER OF CONSCIENCE LANGUISHING IN THE CELLS OF REPRESSIVE REGIMES BUT OUR LETTERS CARDS PETITIONS CAN OPEN THE CHUNK OF LIGHT FOR ONE OR TWO
WE CAN'T TRANSFORMED THE LIVES OF EVERY LONELY PERSON IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES HELP EVERY REFUGEE YOUR ASYLUM SEEKER BUT A SMALL GESTURE CAN MAKE AT LEAST SOME REALISE THAT THEY'RE STILL VALUED AS HUMAN BEINGS
THE MOST WE CAN DO WHEN WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THE BIG ISSUES WHICH THREATENED TO OVERWHELM US IS SOMEONE HAS SAID TO TAKE HOLD OF THEM NEAR THE EDGE OF ONE OF THOSE ISSUES AND SEEK TO ACT AT SOME COST TO OURSELVES
CHANGING THE WORLD MIGHT NEVER APPEAR IN THOSE WORDS IN A MISSION STATEMENT BUT FOR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES FOR HEALTH PROVIDERS AND CHARITIES FOR POLITICAL PARTIES AND FOR MOST RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IT'S EXACTLY WHY THEY EXIST
CERTAINLY THE CHRISTIAN FAITH IS NOT EMBARRASSED BY THIS OBJECTIVE IT AFFIRMS THAT THE WORLD BELONGS TO GOD IS LOVED BY GOD AND HIS ONE DAY COULD BE RESTORED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENTION
IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AND JESUS CHRIST INVITES EVERYONE TO OUR WAY OF LIVING WHICH ASSUMES THAT WHOLE COMMUNITIES COULD BE CHANGED AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS
IT'S SIMPLE IF THE SIMPLEST OF ACTIONS WHICH CAN BE VITAL
AS THE FRENCH SPIRITUAL WRITER FRANCOIS DE SADE PUT IT GREAT WORKS TO AT ALWAYS LIE IN A WAY BUT EVERY MOMENT WE MADE TWO LITTLE ONES EXCELLENTLY THAT HE'S WITH GREAT LOVE
THIS REALLY IS THE BUSINESS OF AT ALL
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND ROY JENKINS IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS THE BAN ON RUSSIAN ATHLETES COMPETING AT THE REAL OLYMPICS IS UNFAIR AND UNJUST IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY THE INTERNATIONAL ATHLETICS FEDERATION DECIDED NOT TO LIFT THE SUSPENSION HE COMPOSED LAST NOVEMBER BECAUSE SO MANY WRITERS HAVE BEEN USING SO MANY DRUGS OVER SO MANY YEARS WHEN I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY THE CHAIRMAN OF U.K. ATHLETICS ED WARNER
I WAS EXCUSE ME STEVE ROSENBERG A CORRESPONDENT IN MOSCOW AND STEVE IT'S NOT ONLY THE PRESIDENT WHO'S ANGRY ABOUT THIS THE PAPERS ARE FULL OF THEM APPARENTLY
OH YES I MEAN THERE'S ANGER IN IN TODAY'S RUSSIA NEWSPAPERS THE TABLOID COME SO MOSCOW PRAVDA SAYS THIS IS THE HARSHEST PUNISHMENT IN THE HISTORY OF SPORT IT SAYS THROUGH THE DECISION OF ITS GOVERNING BODY WORLD ATHLETICS HAS COMMITTED SUICIDE GOOD BY TRACK AND FIELD AND THERE'S ANOTHER PAPER HERE SPORT EXPRESS
AND WHEN YOU READ IT YOU CAN FEEL THE BITTERNESS IN MOSCOW AT THE MOMENT IT SAYS ALL THE HUMILIATION ALL THE CONCESSIONS WE MADE THE COLOSSAL INVESTMENT IN THE BATTLE AGAINST DOPING WHICH WE AGREED TO TO SAVE A PLACE IN THE OLYMPICS IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING IT'S A VERY BITTER LESSON FOR US AND IT CALLS THE AYE AYE I DOUBLY F. FUNCTIONARIES STUCK IN THEIR BLING COULD VIEW THE PAPER SAYS STUCK IN A CLICHE THAT RUSSIA IS THE EVIL EMPIRE
WE'LL PUT IN DO ANYTHING CAN HE DO ANYTHING
WHAT HE IS DOING IS STRESSING NOW THAT COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT IS WRONG THAT IT'S UNFAIR TO PUNISH A CLEAN RUSSIAN ATHLETES FOR THE CRIMES OF A FEW IT'S A MESSAGE THAT RUSSIA HAS BEEN PUSHING OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH INTO THE I OH SEE THE INTERNATIONAL LIMPET COMMITTEE MAKES ITS FINAL DECISION THANKS FOR THAT STEVE MED WARNER NOT SURPRISING I SUPPOSE ALL THAT REACTION
NOT AT ALL WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM RUSSIA OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR HE'S A EXASPERATED FINGER POINTING A SORT OF BUNKER MENTALITY
CORRALS ALL OF THEIR RESOURCES THEY GAVE HIRED EXTERNAL P.R. AGENCIES AND THROUGH ALL OF THAT TIME THEY APPEAR NOT TO HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO REALLY CORRECT THEY'RE THE FLAWS IN THEIR SYSTEM
IF SOMEONE SAID THE OTHER DAY THAT HAD THEY ONLY KNUCKLED DOWN AND GOT ON WITH IT WHEN THEY WERE FIRST SUSPENDED LAST NOVEMBER THEY MIGHT BE IN THE OLYMPICS IN RIO BUT THEY SPENT FAR TOO MUCH TIME
BLAMING OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT RECOGNISING JUST THE DEPTH OF THE CORRUPTION WITHIN THEIR OWN SPORT COURSE RUSSIAN ATHLETES WILL ACTUALLY BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE WELL UNDER A NEUTRAL FLAG IF THEY CAN PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE
YEAH IT'S A IT'S A VERY INTERESTING RULING YESTERDAY BY THE DOUBLE A. F. AND ONE ALMOST WONDERS WHETHER IT WAS VERY CLEVERLY CRAFTED BY THEIR LAWYERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE SEEN NOT TO BE DELIBERATELY PUNISHING EVERYBODY FOR THE SINS OF THE MAJORITY
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THERE ARE VERY VERY FEW TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETES WHO ARE RUSSIAN WHO TRAIN LIVE COMPETE ENTIRELY OUTSIDE OF RUSSIA SO THE REALLY BIG RUSSIAN NAMES THEY'RE CAUGHT UP IN THIS BAND AND THE POSTER GIRL FOR RUSSIAN ATHLETICS YOU LES NOTICED BY AVA WHO'S A GREAT POLE VOLTAR MULTI MEDALLIST DOWN THE YEARS SHE'S TALKING OF TAKING LEGAL ACTION SHE'S VERY CLOSE TO VLADIMIR PUTIN
LOOK HOW LEAVE THE SPORTS MINISTER AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THE RUSSIAN STATE EFFECTIVELY WILL BANKROLL HER LEGAL ACTION AND IT'S GOING TO BE NOISY AND IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE AND FOR THE I.O.C. WHO AS WE JUST HEARD A MEETING NEXT WEEK I'LL BE UNDER INORDINATE PRESSURE SUIT CAVE IN AND ALLOW THE RUSSIANS BACK AND I SINCERELY HOPE THEY DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS CLEAN ATHLETES HAVE BEEN CHEATED FOR MANY YEARS
STATE SPONSORS SYSTEMIC CHEATING IT'S TERRIBLE AND EXPOSED THE HEARTS OF CONFERENCE AND SPORT ON THE OTHER HAND THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT IS IT IS A DENIAL OF NORMAL JUSTICE ISN'T IT IT'S A BIT OF COARSENESS AND DID THAT IT'S A VERY VERY TRICKY MORAL MAZE BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR IS EVIDENCE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY ARE RUSSIAN ATHLETES ARE CAUGHT UP IN THIS SYSTEM NOW WHETHER THEY INADVERTENTLY THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN
TREATED BY DOCTORS THAT HAVE BEEN DOPING THEM WITHOUT THEM KNOWING OR NOT WHO KNOWS BUT THEY HAD BENEFITED FROM THE USE OF ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES AND A MASSIVE COVER UP OF THAT SYSTEM SO YEAH WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT THE VAST MAJORITY DESERVING TO BE PUNISHED AND HAVE A FEW INNOCENT ATHLETES I'LL TOTALLY CAUGHT UP IN THIS THEN MAYBE THIS IS THE WAKE UP CALL THE RUSSIAN EATS AND IT IS A SAD DAY BUT
REALLY THE I.O.C. NEEDS TO LOOK AT IT AND SAY TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETICS IN THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN PUBLICLY BOB WAS WHAT WAS BEING REVEALED IS THAT MANY OTHER RUSSIAN SPORTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME CORRUPTION I HAVE TO ASK WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW THE RUSSIANS SPORTSMEN AND WOMEN WINNING MEDALS THIS SUMMER IN RIO
THEY THEMSELVES BENEFITING FROM THIS THE CROP SYSTEM IT'S NOT OVER IS IT NOT AT ALL AND I THINK YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT I DID IT ONE OF THE THINGS I FEAR IS THAT THE COST AND TIME INVOLVED IN
GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS IS GOING TO DRAG ON THEM AND BUILD OVER THE COURSE OF MANY MONTHS WILL BE ON THE REAL OLYMPICS AND THE LIKES OF THE IDES OF LEFTY NOT HAVE UNLIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES SO WHAT I DO HOPE IT'S THE ICY STANDS BEHIND THE EYE DOUBLE F. AND IS PREPARED TO HELP BANKROLL ITS OWN LEGAL BILL BECAUSE IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT SPORT IS TO SEE THOMAS BACK THE PRESIDENT OF THE I.O.C. NEEDS TO MAKE A STAND FOR CLEAN SPORT AND AS FAR AS THE EYE A DOUBLE IS CONCERNED LORD A CURLEW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN THERE
I THINK HE'S THE CESS SUB PRESIDENTS HE NEEDS TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN THE LINE THAT THE CULMINATION FOR ME OF HIS EARLY WORK IS GOING TO BE LATER THIS YEAR WHEN I GOING TO BE CALLING AN EXTRAORDINARY CONGRESS TO VOTE THROUGH A WHOLE SERIES OF CHANGES IN THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THE SCORE WHICH
MUCH NEEDED AND HE'S BEEN WORKING HARD TOWARDS THAT THAT COMBINATION AND YOU WILL JUDGE HIS PRESIDENCY AT THAT POINT BUT I'M HOPING THAT THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE ALL SEEN HAVE BEEN NECESSARY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE PRESIDENT'S PRESIDENCY WE WANT WAS ONE WE VOTED FOR
HE'S GOING TO REALLY DO THE NECESSARY FOR THE SPORT BUT IT'S DIFFICULT ISN'T IT HAS HE HE WASN'T PERSONALLY CAUGHT UP IN ANY OF THE ALLEGATIONS BUT HE HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE VICE PRESIDENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND LAST YEAR HE TOLD M.P.S THAT HE WASN'T AWARE OF THE SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS AND THEN WE KNOW THAT THE EMAIL WAS SENT AND SO ON AND SO ON IT'S SERIOUSLY MURKY ISN'T IT
I WATCH THE PANORAMA PROGRAMME IT WAS DIFFICULT VIEWING AND DICK THERE THE PROBLEM WITH THESE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATIONS THAT RUN SPORT IS YOU HAVE TO BE INSIDE THE TENDS TO GET ELECTED TO THE HIGHEST OFFICE AND YES
HAS BEEN THERE A LONG TIME BUT AS A CONSEQUENCE THAT HE KNOWS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO I KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING YOU MUST KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON MUST DO THAT'S THE THING I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WE WORCESTER WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IT'S ALL BEEN REFERRED TO WHAT'S CALLED THE ESSEX COMMISSION AT THE I DOUBLE F. WHICH IS CHAIRED BY MICHAEL BELL OFF
HE'S A DISTINGUISHED Q.C. WHO LOVES THE SPORT AND I THINK WE CAN TRUST COMMISSION CAN'T WE WE CAN TRUST MICHAEL BIT OFF IMPLICITLY AND I I'D MET HIM MANY TIMES AND I TRUST THAT YOU WILL DO AND I THINK THIS WILL ALL BE WASHED THROUGH THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND WE'LL SEE WHAT THAT GOES WELL AS YOU SAY WE'LL SEE WHERE THAT GOES ED ARE MANY THANKS
IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT AND LET'S GET A WEATHER FORECAST PETER GIBBS HAS IT PETER I YOU SARAH WILL GET AT LEAST ONE FIND OUT AT THE WEEKEND THERE WEST IS BEST TODAY EAST GETS THE BETTER DEAL TOMORROW BUT FOR ENGLAND AND WALES TODAY IT'S A LARGELY DRY STORY ONLY EXCEPTION SOME PARTS OF EASTERN ENGLAND AND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THE CLOUD COULD JUST BE THICK ENOUGH
GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT RAIN NOW AND AGAIN MORE PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY BUT MOST PLACES WILL MISS THAT BUT WITH FAIRLY CLOUDY SKIES IT WILL FEEL A BIT ON THE COOL SIDE ARE TEMPERATURES OF THIRTEEN FOURTEEN ON THE COAST HERE BUT UP TO SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN INLAND THE REST OF ENGLAND TO THAT SOUTHWEST ENGLAND MIDLANDS NORTHERN ENGLAND AND WALES GETTING SOME DECENT SPELLS OF SUNSHINE BREAKING THROUGH AND IT WILL FEEL REASONABLY PLEASANT IN THE SUNSHINE HIGHS OF SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN
SIMILAR TEMPERATURES FOR NORTHERN IRELAND WHERE IT WILL BE A DRY DAY SOME OF THE BEST THE SUNSHINE HERE AND LIGHT WINDS AS WELL EVENTUALLY SOME RAIN COMING IN FROM THE WEST DURING THE EVENING BUT FIND AHEAD FOR ALL OF SCOTLAND AS WELL BIT ON THE CLOUDY SIDE AT THE MOMENT IN PLACES BUT MUCH OF THAT CLOUD WILL BREAK UP SO PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE ACROSS SCOTLAND GETTING SOME LONG SPELLS OF SUNSHINE AS THE DAY WEARS ON THE WIND BY LIGHT HERE TOO SO TEMPERATURES SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DEGREES IT WILL FEEL WARMER THAN THOSE NUMBERS WOULD SUGGEST
TONIGHT THERE WILL SEE RAIN THICKENING UP I THINK THE THICKLY CLAD PING RATHER TO WESTERN AREAS A BIT CHILLIER SKIES CLEAR IN THE EAST OF THE U.K. PARTICULARLY EASTERN ENGLAND BUT THAT'S WHERE THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE WILL BE TOMORROW SUNDAY AND THAT I COULD SEE TEMPERATURES GETTING UP TO TWENTY ONE DEGREES IN SOME EASTERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND TOMORROW BUT FURTHER WEST TOMORROW TURNING INTO A BIT OF A WET DAY FOR NORTHERN IRELAND PARTICULARLY ALSO WESTERN SCOTLAND WALES MORE WESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND SEEING SOME RAIN COMING IN AND THAT MARKS A RATHER UNSETTLED START FOR MANY OF US

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE IN THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING POLICE HAVE CHARGED THOMAS MAYOR WITH THE MURDER OF THE LABOUR M.P. JOE COX THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HAS ISSUED ANOTHER ECONOMIC WARNING ABOUT BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. THE FORMER CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE STAFF WHO ORIGINALLY SUPPORTED REMAINING IN THE E.U. HAS SAID HE HAS CHANGED HIS MIND

THE SHADOW LEADER OF THE COMMONS LABOUR'S CHRIS BRYANT SAYS HE HAS REPEATEDLY WARNED WESTMINSTER AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE RISKS FACED BY M.P.S IN THEIR CONSTITUENCIES EVEN SAYING THAT SOMEONE WILL BE SHOT DOWNING STREET HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE FEMALE CONSERVATIVE M.P. WROTE TO THE PRIME MINISTER LAST YEAR TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY AND SAYS DAVID CAMERON SPOKE TO HER AND LOCAL POLICE WERE ASKED TO DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO HELP
A SPOKESMAN ALSO SAY THE NEW SECURITY PACKAGE WAS UNVEILED IN JANUARY BUT CHRIS BRYANT TOLD NEWSNIGHT THAT MORE NEEDED TO BE DONE
THERE'S NO CO ORDINATION FROM THE CENTRE IN JANUARY EVERY SINGLE M. P. WAS MEANT TO BE CONTACTED BY THE BOROUGH COMMANDER TO HAVE SOME KIND OF ASSESSMENT DONE I'D BE SURPRISED IF A FIFTH OF M.P.S HAD A CONTACT FROM THEIR BAD COME ON AND THE TRUTH IS WE ALL KNOW THAT WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE PROPER PRECAUTIONS NOT OVER THE TOP PRECAUTIONS JUST SENSIBLE PRECAUTIONS
THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HAS ADDED TO ITS PREVIOUS WARNINGS ABOUT THE RISKS OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE YOU SAYING THE ECONOMY COULD BE FIVE AND A HALF PER CENT SMALLER BY TWENTY NINETEEN THE MYTH THE U.K. STAYED IN THE I.M.F. SAID THERE COULD BE A RECESSION NEXT YEAR BUT ECONOMISTS IN FAVOUR OF BRECHT'S IT SAID THE FORECASTS USED A FLAWED MODEL IT'S A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT THEO NEGATIVE
THE I.M.F. SS MANAGING DIRECTOR CHRISTINE LA GARDE RECENTLY SUGGESTED THAT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON BRITAIN OF LEAVING THE E.U. COULD RANGE FROM PRETTY BAD TO VERY VERY BAD NOW THE FUND HAS PUBLISHED ITS DETAILED RESEARCH IT SUGGESTS THAT UNCERTAINTY THE LOSS OF INWARD INVESTMENT AND AFFECTS ON TRADE WOULD OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS OF REDUCED REGULATION AND NOT CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS THE E.U. BUDGET
UNDER A SO CALLED LIMITED SCENARIO IT SAYS THE ECONOMY WOULD BE ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT SMALLER BY TWENTY NINETEEN BUT IT WOULD BE IF BRITAIN REMAINED IN THE E.U. HOWEVER THIS ASSUMES THE U.K. WOULD STILL BE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET AND ALLOW THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE SOMETHING VOTE LEAVE SAYS IT WOULDN'T ACCEPT
UNDER A MORE PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO THE I.M.F. SAYS THE ECONOMY WOULD BE FIVE POINT SIX PERCENT SMALLER AND THERE WOULD BE A RECESSION NEXT YEAR THE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH A BROAD RANGE OF ECONOMIC OPINION BUT PROFESSOR PATRICK MINFORD OF THE GROUP ECONOMIST FOR BRECHT'S IT SAYS THE REPORT AS FLAWED MODELS AND MAKES WRONG DECEITFUL ASSUMPTIONS TO PROJECT DOOM AND GLOOM
THE FORMER CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE STAFF LORD GUTHRIE WHO SIGNED AN OPEN LETTER EARLIER THIS YEAR SUPPORTING BRITAIN'S PLACE IN THE E.U.

FOUR MONTHS AGO SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST SENIOR FORMER MILITARY COMMANDERS SIGNED A LETTER THAT STATED WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST TO REMAIN AN E.U. MEMBER BUT NOW LORD GUTHRIE THE PROFESSIONAL HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND ONE HAS CHANGED HIS MIND
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HE SAYS HE MADE A MISTAKE AGREEING TO ADD HIS NAME TO A LETTER DRAFTED BY DOWNING STREET HE IS NOW CATEGORIC FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF THE DEFENCE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM A LIVE VOTE IS BETTER HE SAYS IT WOULD BE A DISASTER TO HAVE A EUROPEAN ARMY HAS RIVALS TO NATO HE HAD
THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY SAID THE U.K. HAS A VETO OVER JOINING ANY EUROPEAN ARMY AND NEVER WOULD

AND REACTING TO THE NEWS PRESIDENT PUTIN SAID THAT WAS UNFAIR POSITIONING IS THROUGH WITH YOU I IS THOSE NUMBER FROM WHICH TO THAT OF COURSE IT'S UNJUST RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD ALWAYS BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY INDIVIDUAL IF A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY HAS COMMITTED THE CRIME WOULD IT BE FAIR TO HAUL THAT THE HALL FAMILY LIABLE INCLUDING YOU THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S DONE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH VIOLATIONS WHY SHOULD THEY SUFFER BECAUSE OF THE OTHERS

THE BRITISH ASTRONAUT TIM PEAKE IS ON HIS WAY BACK TO EARTH AFTER SIX MONTHS ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION A CAPSULE CARRYING HIM AND COLLEAGUES FROM THE U.S. AND RUSSIA HAS DETACHED ITSELF FROM THE STATION AND IS DUE TO LAND IN KAZAKHSTAN LATER THIS MORNING HE'S OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT
RE ENTRY INTO THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE AND LANDING ON SOLID GROUND WILL BE AMONG THE RISKIEST PARTS OF TIM PEAKS MISSION HE'S SO YOU SPACECRAFT IS CURRENTLY ORBITING THE EARTH AT NINE TWENTY BRITISH SUMMERTIME IT'S DUE TO BEGIN AN ENGINE BURNED TO SLOW ITSELF DOWN AND BEGIN THE PROCESS OF RE ENTRY
AS IT ENTERS THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE THE OUTSIDE OF THE SPACE CRAFT WILL BE HEATED TO TWO THOUSAND DEGREES CELSIUS THAT THE HEAT SHIELD WILL PROTECT THE ASTRONAUTS INSIDE
PARACHUTES AND A THRUSTER AT THE LAST SECOND WILL SLOW THE SPACECRAFT DOWN BEFORE THE ASTRONAUTS LANDED KAZAKHSTAN WITH A BUMP
OF REPORTING IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT WELL AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING IN THE BULLETINS THE THOMAS MAYOR WILL APPEAR IN COURT IN LONDON TODAY IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING POLICE SAID THEY HAD CHARGED HIM WITH THE MURDER OF JOE COLE
SINCE HER DEATH ON THURSDAY THERE HAS BEEN A VERY PUBLIC OUTPOURING OF GRIEF IN HER CONSTITUENCY YESTERDAY DAVID CAMERON SAID THE KILLING HAD SHOCKED THE NATION BUT IS HE POINTED OUT IT WILL BE TO VERY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WILL BE MOST AFFECTED
THE MOST PROFOUND THING THAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT TWO CHILDREN HAVE LOST THEIR MOTHER ONE HUSBAND HAS LOST A LOVING WIFE
AND OF COURSE PARLIAMENT HAS LOST ONE OF ITS MATES
PASSIONATE AND BRILLIANT CAMPAIGNER SOMEONE WHO A PITTA UP THE FACT THE POLITICS IS ABOUT SERVING OTHERS WHAT STANDING ALONGSIDE IN THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN HE SAID THE PUBLIC NEEDED TO COME TOGETHER
I'VE ASKED THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE SPEAKER FOR THE RECALL OF PARLIAMENT ON MONDAY
THEY EXPECT ACCEPTED THAT REQUEST AND PARLIAMENT WILL BE RECALLED ON MONDAY SO THAT WE CAN PAY DUE TRIBUTE
ON BEHALF OF EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY WHO VALUES DEMOCRACY THAT IS THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH AND VALUES THE RIGHT OF POLITICAL EXPRESSION
FREE FROM THE KIND OF BRUTALITY THAT JOE
WHY WE ALL NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE MUST HAVE PROTECTION AND SECURITY IN ORDER TO FUNCTION IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
ALTHOUGH JOE COX HAD ONLY BEEN AN M.P. FOR A YEAR SHE WAS WELL KNOWN IN HER CONSTITUENCY CHILDREN AT ONE SCHOOL EXPLAINED WHAT SHE HAD MEANT TO THEM IF THEY STOP ALL PEWS THAT BORING BUT WHEN I MET YOUR COXON YOU LISTEN AND PISA REALLY LIVELY FUNNY CHARACTER AND SHE WAS A REALLY FUNNY CARING PERSON GOING UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY TAKING EVERYONE'S IDEAS AND JUST TRYING TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
WHEN SHE TOLD US THAT SHE WAS AN M.P. AND THEY WERE VERY UNDERSTANDING SHE STOOD UP FOR WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT YOU MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO OUR COMMUNITY
THERE'S OF COURSE CHILDREN WHO HAD MET HER BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILY AT THE HEART OF IT TWO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN AGED THREE AND FIVE JULIA SAMUEL HE'S FOUND A PATRON OF THE CHILD BEREAVEMENT TRUST AND HE'S IN A RADIO CAR NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
TO LOSE YOUR MOTHER I MEAN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION BUT TO DO SO IN SUCH A PUBLIC WAY DOES IT MAKE IT EASIER OR HARDER TO COPE WITH THEIR GRIEF
I MEAN FOR THREE AND A FIVE YEAR OLD THEY WILL KIND OF BE AWARE OF
THE STRESS AND THE IMPACT OF THE DEATH BECAUSE THERE'LL BE SO MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSE I IMAGINE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN THEY'RE FAMILY THEIR FATHER WILL PROTECT THEM FROM
THE METEOR BUT OF COURSE FOR HIM IT ADDS ANOTHER LAYER OF STRESS AFTER THE SORT OF SHATTERING NEWS OF HIS WIFE'S DEATH AND IT CAN FEEL EXTREMELY INTRUSIVE
I MEAN AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM OF SOME PEOPLE
THE KIND OF EXTERNAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF HUH WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN SHE WAS HIGHER MUCH PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT HER LOSS CAN KIND OF MATCH HIS INTERNAL FEELING OF LOSS ALTHOUGH OF COURSE IS VERY PERSONAL SO AND YOU CAN NEVER SAY EXACTLY HOW SOMEONE'S GOING TO FEEL AND I SUPPOSE IT'S CERTAINLY
CERTAINLY ADDS ANOTHER LAYER OF OF DIFFICULTY AND COMPLEXITY FOR THE FAMILY AND THE CHILDREN THE AGES THEY'RE SO YOUNG THEY CAN PRESUMABLY NOT COMPREHEND THEY STILL EXPECT MUMMY'S GOING TO COME
YES CHILDREN EVEN AT A VERY YOUNG AGE REALLY NEED TO BE TOLD THE TRUTH AT THAT THEIR MOTHER IS DIED AND THAT THAT IS PERMANENT AND ATE CHILDREN OF THAT AGE AND ACTUALLY I THINK ALL OF US TO SOME EXTENT HAVE MAGICAL THINKING SO THEY'LL KEEP TESTING AND ASKING QUESTIONS AND MAYBE ASKING THE SAME QUESTION OVER AND OVER AND FAMILIES AND PARENTS NEED TO
RESPOND WITH THE SAME ANSWERS SO THAT THEY'RE CONSISTENT SO THEY CAN CONSISTENTLY SAY AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE REALLY SAD THAT THEY'RE WHAT THEIR MOTHER IS DIED NOW YOU WOULD IT'S A LIFETIME OF ADJUSTMENT YOU NOTES AND THROUGH THEIR LIVES THEY WILL GRIEVE HER LOSS FOR ME
WHEN I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU THAT LIFE BECAUSE YOU WERE VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH PRINCESS DIANA AND HELPED BOTH WILLIAM AND HARRY HARRY AFTER HER DEATH BUT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE SO MUCH OLDER I THINK THEY WERE WHAT TWELVE AND FIFTEEN AT THE TIME BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN NEVER GET AWAY WITH BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC RECORD
I MEAN THAT I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO ASK ME ABOUT THAT BUT WHAT I MEAN I THINK IF THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THERE'S KIND OF TWO RELATIONSHIPS ISN'T THERE THERE'S THE PUBLIC'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PERSONAL AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT HER AND YOUR VERY PERSONAL AND PRIVATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PERSON THAT'S DIED AND SOMETIMES I IMAGINE WITH ANY PRETTY THERE'S A CLASH AND SOMETIMES IT MATCHES
AND IS THE BEST THING JUST TO NOT OPEN SOCIAL MEDIA NOT OPEN NEWSPAPERS
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ISN'T IT I THINK IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE SOCIAL MEDIA TO SOME EXTENT EVEN EIGHT OR NINE YEAR OLDS NOW HAVE A KNIFE AND SAY IT'S VERY HARD TO PROTECT THEM AND I THINK THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS PIE OUT YOUNG FAMILIES YOUNG PEOPLE SEEING IMAGES YOU KNOW LIKE YOUR LEARNT HIS SHOOTING LAST WEEK THAT GIVE THEM A SENSE OF FEAR AND TERROR ABOUT THE WORLD WHERE
IN REALITY HOPEFULLY IT'S VERY RARE AND I THINK WE NEED TO FIND A WAY OF ADDRESSING THAT JULIA SAMUEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT IN A COUPLE OF HOURS TIM PEAKE WELL IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN SET FOOT ON PLANET EARTH AGAIN THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE BLASTED OFF INTO SPACE SIX MONTHS AGO HE WILL FLOW DOWN ONTO THE CAT'S STEP IN RUSSIA TO ABOUT A QUARTER PAST TEN HOUR TIME REBECCA MORALE IS OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT AND SHE IS WITH ME REBECCA WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
THAT EXCITING IT IS EXCITING IT IS EXCITING PRETTY NERVE WRACKING FOR TIM I AM WELL AFTER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX DAYS IN SPACE HE IS ON HIS WAY BACK TO EARTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT EVERYONE WAS ASLEEP TIM SAID FAREWELL TO THE SPACE STATION TOOK A LAST LOOK AROUND AT THOSE AMAZING VIEWS THAT YOU GET FROM FOUR HUNDRED KILOMETRES ABOVE THE EARTH AND ENTERED THE SAWYERS SPACECRAFT READY FOR HIS JOURNEY HOME
AND THEY HAD TRIED TO THERE SO USE TEAR MAY NINETEEN CLOSED AT NINE THIRTY FOUR P.M. CENTRAL TIME SIT DOWN ALREADY THE CREWS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HADJ INTERPHASE SO WILL BEGIN A SERIES OF LICK TRACKS OVER THE NEXT NINETY MINUTES
SO AFTER DONNING HIS SO CALLED SPACE SUIT WHICH IS LIKE A PROTECTIVE COCOON IN CASE THERE ARE ANY DEPRESSURISATION INCIDENTS UP THERE LOOKING AT THE EXACT TIMINGS FOR LANDING REVIEWING HIS SAFETY PROCEDURES WITH MISSION CONTROL AT SIX FIFTY TWO A.M. AT THE SOYA SPACECRAFT FINALLY SEPARATED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
I CAN CONFIRM I DON'T KNOW A TWELVE FIFTY TO A CENTRAL TIME ONE FIFTY TWO
AS THE SAW USE AND THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FLEW TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR MILES OVER FAR EASTERN MONGOLIA
SO THE FIRST STAGE OF THIS JOURNEY HOME IS ACTUALLY QUITE GENTLE YOU COULD SEE THE SAWYERS SPACECRAFT GENERALLY EASING AWAY FROM THE SPACE STATION IT'S A LOVELY SIDE TO ANY OH VIEWS WONDERFUL GRACEFUL EASY THE REST OF THE JOURNEY IT'S GOING TO BE HORRIBLE THOUGH THE NEXT STAGE IS GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A RIDE FOR TIM
COS IT'S NOT THAT NICE SMOOTH DROP THAT WE ALL ASSUME HE'D HE'D RATTLING AROUND A BIT NO EXACTLY I MEAN THE THING IS ESSENTIALLY YOU'VE GOT SPACE CRAFT TRAVELLING AT TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND KILOMETRES AN HOUR FOUR HUNDRED KILOMETRES ABOVE THE EARTH YOU NEED IT ENTERED THE EARTH'S
ATMOSPHERE SUE NEEDS IT'S REALLY CHANGED TRAJECTORY AND YOU DO THAT BY SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES ESSENTIALLY IT'S RED HOT IT GETS RED HOT IT'S GONNA EXPERIENCE TEMPERATURES OF A THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DEGREES AS IT COMES AND THANKFULLY THERE'S GOING TO BE A PROTECTIVE HEAT SHIELD YOU'LL START TO FEEL GRAVITY FOR THE FIRST TIME TO IMAGINE SIX MONTHS IN MICRO GRAVITY AND FESTIVAL THIS MIGHT FEEL KIND OF O.K. YOU'RE BACK
FEELING ITSELF AGAINST BACK YOUR YOUR CHAIR FOR EXAMPLE AND IT'S GOING TO START TO FEEL REALLY REALLY HEAVY AS HE EXPERIENCES FORCE FIVE GEES THE FORCE EXERTED ON HIM THEN THE PARACHUTES FIRE THAT JOLTS THE LITTLE DESCENT MODULE AROUND AND THEN JUST BEFORE HE HITS THE GROUND SOME THRUSTERS FIRE THIS IS TO SORT OF EASE THE IMPACT IT'S CALLED A SOFT LANDING
IS ANYTHING BUT I'VE SEEN FOOTAGE OF THESE THINGS IT LOOKS TERRIFYING REALLY GOES INTO THE GROUND WITH A BANG AND THE ASTRONAUTS HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS BEING LIKE A COLLISION BETWEEN A GIANT LORRY AND A TINY CAR AND GUESS WHAT HE'S THE ONE IN THE TIME BUT THEN THE SILENCE THE HATCH OPENS ANNIE BREEDS
IT'S AIR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX MONTHS IT LOOKS PETRIFYING I MEAN FOR A MERE MORTAL LIKE ME I'M SURE FOR TIM PEAKE AND WHAT A LOVELY DESCRIPTION THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND LET'S GO TO SOMEBODY WHO'S DONE IT OF COURSE HELEN SHARMAN ARE FIRST BRICKED IN SPACE WHAT HE FEEDING MUST BE TERRIFIED HELEN THAT WERE YOU
I DON'T THINK HE'S TERRIFIED NO I THINK HE IS HE'LL BE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING BACK BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST IT IS A NICE GENTLE VIEW OUT OF THE WINDOW BUT HE IS BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO HIS BODY'S GOING TO START TO NEED TO BE PREPARED AND HE'LL KNOW WHEN TO HAVE THAT BRACE WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO FIRE THE AND THE RETRO ROCKETS TO SLOW THEM DOWN SO THEY WILL COME BACK TOWARDS THE ATMOSPHERE ITSELF
AND THEN OF COURSE THE ATMOSPHERE ITSELF AS THAT BUILDS UP WITH HER GET FOUR OR FIVE G. CONRAD TO FEELING WEIGHTLESS NEAR TO MULTIPLY YOU WAIT FLIGHT BY FIVE IT'S VERY VERY HEAVY SO JUST BREATHING WILL BE MORE LABOURED AND DIFFICULT FOR HIM BUT HE LIVED IN THIS IN A CENTRIFUGE WE KNOW THAT HE'S STRONG AND FIT AND AS THEY ALL ARE IN THIS CROW AND HE'S HERE HE KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT AT LEAST OVER THERE MUST BE A VIEW SURELY THERE MUST BE I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ASKED THIS A MILLION TIMES BUT THERE MUST BE A BIT OF YOU THAT THINKS WHAT IF IT GOES WRONG
YOU KNOW THIS THEN BEFORE YOU CAN LAUNCH INTO SPACE BUT HAVE IT ONCE YOU'VE MADE THE DECISION TO GO YOU KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO COME BACK AND THERE IS NO WAY ROUND IT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY BACK AND SO THERE IS IT'S NOT A THOUGHT OF SHALL I DO IT OR NOT HE IS HE'S KICKED IN THE SERIES CRAFT IS ON HIS WAY BACK AND HE'S JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE DOES WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO AND JUST GETS BACK AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE AND HE'S WITH YOU NOW JUST JUST REALLY IT'S QUITE IT IS JUST TO RIDE THE COMMANDER'S GOT GOT THE CONTROLS IF NECESSARY BUT IT SHOULD ALL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY
PRETTY MUCH WE'VE GOT TO FIRE YE DID THE END INTO DE BURN BUT EVEN THAT SHOULD BE A FAIRLY AUTOMATIC PROCESS SO I GUESS HE JUST GOT TO AND LET'S ENJOY IT AS BEST HE CAN WRITE WELL NOW HEE HEE HEE LANDS HE'D BE HEAT TAKES HIS FIRST STEPS HE'S WELCOME BY ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE I GET IT YOU ROW AND ALL THE REST IS THERE THEN WAS THERE FOR YOU THAT PERIOD
OF SORT OF ANTI CLIMAX I SUPPOSE YOU'VE HAD THIS MASSIVE EXCITEMENT THERE'S THIS GREAT CLIMAX AND THEN YOU THINK I AM LITERALLY BACK TO EARTH WITH A BUMP I THINK HE SAID IT FOR HIM IT WILL BE ONE CONTINUATION THERE'LL BE A MEDICAL DEBRIEFING IMMEDIATELY AND THEN POSSIBLY SOME VERY VERY QUICK TECHNICAL DEBRIEFINGS JUST IN CASE THERE'S ANYTHING REALLY URGENT THAT THEY NEED TO PASS ON BUT THEN ALL THIS BUSINESS GETTING BACK TO COLOGNE THIS EVENING TO MEET HIS FAMILY AGAIN AND
IT'S THIS SO GRADUAL ADJUSTMENT FOR HIM THERE WILL BE A CONTINUITY TECHNICAL DEBRIEFING MORE MEDICAL STUDIES ON HIS BODY AND PRESS CONFERENCES GALORE AND THEN HE WILL BE BACK IN THE U.K. WE HOPE QUITE SOON AND TELLING US HIS STORIES AND A PASSING ON INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HE'D BEEN DOING UP THERE
SO I THINK FOR HIM IT WILL JUST BE A ROLLING HER RIDE IT METAPHORICALLY AFTERWARDS AND IT'S NOT AN ANTI CLIMAX IN THAT RESPECT IT'S RIGHT FOR US BUT WE DON'T WE'RE NOT SEEING IT ALL THE TIME SO WE DO PERHAPS IMAGINE THAT HE'S JUST GONE HOME AND DAD PUT HIS FEET AND WATCHING THE TELLY IN THE EVENING BUT YOU NEVER HAVE ANY MOMENTS WHERE YOU THOUGHT OLD LORD LIFE'S BORING
LIFE'S VERY DIFFERENT BACK ON EARTH AND EASY I THINK ALL ASTRONAUTS WANT TO RETURN A LINE AND YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK I'LL DIE ON MARS BUT EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO BACK AND DEFINITELY I WOULD AND I'M SURE TIM WILL DO WE WANT IN THE SAME WITHIN SECONDS OF HIM LANDING IT IS JUST SUCH A FABULOUS PLACE TO BE SO MANY THINGS THAT YOU JUST CAN'T DO ON
YEAH THAT TEAM SPIRIT AND THE VIEW ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC WE SO ENVY YOU RUTH HELEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND REBECCA THANKS BOTH DO INDEED EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY HAS JUST TWEETED WILLIE'S SUFFER JETLAG THERE'S A QUESTION IT'S NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT TIME FOR LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH DESCRIBES JOE COX'S ONE OF DEMOCRACIES MARTYRS THIS HARDWORKING PASSIONATE M.P. WAS SENSELESSLY MURDERED WHILE PERFORMING HER DUTIES IT SAYS THE NATION IS STUNNED HER POLITICAL COLLEAGUES ARE BEREFT
THE MAIL SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL WOMAN WITH A LOVING HEARTY WENT INTO POLITICS WITH THE HOLY SELFLESS AIM OF SERVING HER COMMUNITY AND DOING WHAT SHE COULD TO MAKE THIS A KINDER AND BETTER WORLD THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS MISSUS COX WAS NOT A NATIONALLY KNOWN FIGURE BUT MANY TODAY WERE SORELY WISH THEY'D KNOWN HER WHILE SHE WAS ALIVE THE MIRROR SAYS IT'S BECAUSE MY COCK WAS ACCESSIBLE AND IN TOUCH WITH VOTE IT WAS THAT SHE WAS VULNERABLE AND THE TELEGRAPH SAYS A DEMOCRATIC NATION MUST RESPOND TO THE OUTRAGE OF HER MURDER WITH UNITY NOT DIVISION WITH CALM NOT PANIC
BASIL THYME SAYS MANY WILL WONDER WHETHER HER DEATH IS THE PRODUCT OF SOME FAILING IN BRITAIN'S POLITICAL CULTURE BUT IT SAYS THE GROWING DOMINATION DOMINANCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA WITH THE CLOAK OF ANONYMITY IT OFFERS IS COURSON POLITICAL ARGUMENT AND LEADING TO AN UPSURGE OF VIOLENCE AND INTEMPERATE LANGUAGE MANY URGE THEIR READERS TO LOOK ON THEIR POLITICIANS MORE KINDLY JONATHAN PHELAN THE GUARDIAN SAYS THERE ARE SOME POLITICIANS WHO ARE ALL ABOUT EGO AND VANITY AND HOGGING THE CAMERA BUT THERE ARE
COUNTLESS MORE WHO GET AN SEAT LITTLE PUBLIC ATTENTION WHO TOIL AWAY KNOCKING ON DOORS FIELDING COMPLAINTS ABOUT BROKEN DRAINS ARE NOISY NEIGHBOURS AND ARE REWARDED WITH LITTLE THANKS AND OFTEN A DOWNPOUR OF ABUSE IN THE WORDS OF THE MALE'S PARLIAMENTARY SKETCH WRITER QUENTIN LETTS ALTHOUGH M.P.S MAY OFTEN FRUSTRATE AND IRRITATE US THEY DESERVE OUR RESPECT FOR THE SACRIFICES THEY MAKE AS THEY PURSUE THEIR VOCATION OF DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATION
ACCORDING TO THE SUN'S POLITICAL COMMENTATOR JAMES FORESIGHT ADVANCED PLANS ARE UNDERWAY IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO MAKE SURE THAT DAVID CAMERON REMAINS PRIME MINISTER WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM VOTE TO ENSURE A PERIOD OF STABILITY HE SAYS BORIS JOHNSON HAS SIGNED A LETTER SAYING MISTER CAMERON MUST STAY ON THEY CAN CLEAR THAT HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN ANY COUP ATTEMPT MICHAEL GO VERN DUBBA CABINET MEMBERS CAMPAIGNING FOR ONLY VOTE HAVE ALSO PUT THEIR NAMES TO THE LETTER AND SIGNATURES ARE NOW BEING COLLECTED FROM TORY M.P.S

M. M. IT'S TWENTY FIVE PAST EIGHT HERE IS CHRIS WITH THE SPORT MORE CHRIS WHAT ARE YOU GOING JOHN YES AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING THIS MORNING RUSSIAN ATHLETES WILL NOT TAKE PART IN THIS SUMMER'S OLYMPIC GAMES IN RIO AFTER THE R. DOUBLE A. F. UNANIMOUSLY TO UPHOLD THE SUSPENSION NOT SURPRISINGLY THE REACTION FROM BRITISH ATHLETES HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE AMONG THEM FORMER SPRINTER DARREN CAMPBELL

OF COURSE COULD STILL OVERTURN THE DECISION AND ALLOW RUSSIA TO COMPETE HOW WORRIED ARE YOU THAT THEY MIGHT
OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT ON TUESDAY I DON'T THINK I HOPE THEY DON'T OBVIOUSLY ALLOW THE WHOLE TEAM TO COMPETE AT FROM WHAT I'VE READ THEY'RE HOPING
YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE ARE SOME CLEAN RUSSIAN ATHLETES WHO MAY APPEAL AND OBVIOUSLY APPLIED TO COMPETE BUT IN MY OPINION I DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE CLEAN ATHLETES WERE ONE OF THE ATHLETES SHE REFERRED TO THERE IS VERY WELL KNOWN BY EVER THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER IN THE POLE VAULT SHE SAID THAT DENYING HER THE CHANCE TO COMPETE IN RIO IS SIMPLY A VIOLATION OF OUR HUMAN RIGHTS
WHICH IS QUESTIONABLE YOU KNOW THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN VIOLATING CLEAN ATHLETES HUMAN RIGHTS FOR YEARS IN MY OPINION AND IT'S NOT A VERY NICE FEELING AND SO I THINK SHE'S ON ME THE OTHER END OF THAT SADLY AT THE MOMENT BUT SHE SHOULD TAKE THAT UP AND HER GRIEVANCES WITH NATIONAL FEDERATION BECAUSE IT SITS THERE
YOU KNOW LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT THAT HE'S GOT HER INTO THIS SITUATION WOULD YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HER UNDER OTHER ATHLETES WHO CAN PROVE THEMSELVES CLEAN COMPETING AS INDEPENDENT NEUTRAL ATHLETES
OBVIOUSLY SHE'S NOT SHE'S NOT FAILED A DRUGS TEST BUT YOU KNOW I THINK SHE HAS TO GO SOME WAY TO PROVE THAT SHE'S NOT BEEN PART OF THE RUSSIAN SYSTEM AND I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW SHE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW THERE MAY WELL BE CLEAN RUSSIAN ATHLETES BUT YOU KNOW THE SCALE OF THE DOPING PROBLEM IN RUSSIA MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT THAT'S UNLIKELY

IN THE PAST HALF HOUR THE BELGIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE SAID THAT A DOZEN PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF CLIMBING AND ATTACK HAD BEEN ARRESTED AS PART OF A BIG COUNTER TERRORISM OPERATION MORE THAN FORTY RAIDS TOOK PLACE OVERNIGHT MAINLY IN BRUSSELS
A NEW REPORT BY THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND WARNS THAT THE BRITISH ECONOMY COULD SHRINK BY AS MUCH AS FIVE POINT SIX PERCENT OUTSIDE THE E.U. ECONOMISTS IN FAVOUR OF BRECHT'S AT THE I.M.F. FORECAST IS FLAWED AND MAKES DECEITFUL ASSUMPTIONS
THE FORMER CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE STAFF LORD GUTHRIE WHO PUBLICLY BACKED THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN FOUR MONTHS AGO SAYS THE PROSPECT OF A EUROPEAN ARMY HAS CHANGED HIS MIND AND HE WILL NOW VOTE LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE U.K. WOULD NEVER JOIN ANY EUROPEAN ARMY
PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS SAID THAT BANNING RUSSIAN ATHLETES FROM THE RIO OLYMPICS IS UNFAIR AND UNJUST THE ATHLETICS WORLD GOVERNING BODY SAID YESTERDAY THAT RUSSIA HAD NOT MADE ENOUGH PROGRESS IN TACKLING DOPING TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE FIVE DAYS TO GO AND IT'S STILL THE ECONOMY AND IMMIGRATION DOMINATING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IF IMMIGRATION IS INDEED AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST OF CONCERNS WHAT IS IT THAT WORRIES US ABOUT IT MIGRANTS TAKING OUR JOBS DRIVING DOWN WAY HE'S COMPETING FOR HOUSES AND HEALTH SERVICES AND SCHOOL PLACES
OR IS IT THE FEAR OF BEING OVERWHELMED IN SOME ILL DEFINED WAY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS IS TO LOOK AT THE EFFECT IMMIGRATIONS HAD ON THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE WAR AND SO OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS I'VE BEEN TO THREE AREAS OF BRITAIN EACH WITH ITS OWN DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF IT I BEGAN IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS AGO THE IMMIGRANTS STARTED ARRIVING
MOSTLY FROM BANGLADESH AND INDIA AND THEY KEPT COMING
TODAY KEIGHLEY IS ONE OF THE MOST SEGREGATED TONGUES
IT'S NOW THERE'S YOU THERE CAUSING THE DIVISION IT'S THE WHITE
THAT IS THE WAY AREAS WHERE WE ARE NOT WELCOME WE'VE GOT A GOOD BUY
CARS RUN THE LIES WINDOWS BOB DRIVE AN HOUR DOWN THE MOTORWAY FROM KEIGHLEY TO A LITTLE TOWN CALLED SHIREBROOK AND YOU'RE HERE ON THE FRONT LINE OF THE LATEST WAVE OF IMMIGRATION
YOU SEE HIM GOING UP A TRAIN FROM TRAIN STATIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN A DOZEN WHERE THE CASE IS IN THERE IS AND IT'S LIKE A BOAT
AND YOU FILL IT WITH WATER IT CAN ONLY HOLD SO MUCH AND THEN AFTER A BIT IT'S GOING TO EXPLODE
ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS SOUTH TOWARDS PERHAPS THE MOST COSMOPOLITAN CITY ON THE PLANET AND THIS IS A PRIMARY SCHOOL IN EAST LONDON WERE ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE THEY WHAT OUGHT TO BE PRETTY
I THINK IT'S ABOUT DEMONSTRATING WHAT WE NOW CALL BRITISH VALUES SUCH AS HOLDING THE DOOR OPEN FOR ANYBODY WHO'S WALKING ALONG THE CORRIDOR SENDING A THANK YOU LETTER BEING ABLE TO SHAKE HANDS AND
LIFT YOUR HEAD AND LOOK SOMEBODY IN THE EYES THREE DIFFERENT VOICES FROM THREE DIFFERENT PARTS OF BRITAIN THREE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES OF IMMIGRATION
IN THIS REPORT I'M NOT LOOKING AT WHO'S RIGHT AND WHO'S WRONG IN THE REFERENDUM DEBATE BUT RATHER AT THE EFFECT THAT IMMIGRATION HAS HAD IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE FIRST WAVE LANDED ON THE SHORES OF POST WAR
THE TILBURY THE EMPIRE WINDRUSH BRINGS TO BRITAIN FIVE HUNDRED JAMAICAN CITIZENS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE COMING TO THE MOTHER COUNTRY WITH GOOD INTEREST THEY WANTED JOBS THEY WANTED THEIR HOMES THEY WANTED SCHOOLS FOR THEIR CHILDREN OR DOCTORS WHEN THEY GOT SICK AND THEY WERE WELCOMED THE NATION WAS INTRIGUED CURIOUS
BUT WHEN MANY MORE CROSSED THE ATLANTIC AND THEN ASIANS STARTED ARRIVING THAT CURIOSITY BEGUN MORPHING INTO CONCERN I AM VERY PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF INTRODUCING THIS SERIES OF PROGRAMMES MINISTERS FELT THE NEED FOR A PUBLIC GESTURE OF WELCOME FOR IT IS PART OF THEIR PURPOSE TO HELP YOU TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE IN THIS
SO THAT YOU CAN SETTLE HAPPILY AMONG US IN OTHER WORDS INTEGRATE THIS IS A SWITCH ON THE WALL
THIS IS A
IF I PRESS THE SWITCH THE LIGHT WILL COME ON BREATHTAKINGLY PATRONISED
BUT THE GOVERNMENT WAS STARTING TO GET WORRIED THE WELCOME IS BEGINNING TO WEAR THIN A B.B.C. REPORTER FROM JAMAICA FOLLOWED UP AN ADVERTISEMENT
WHICH YOU ADVERTISE YEAH IF YOU LET THE LADY BURNETT
SUSPICION AND HOSTILITY WERE GROWING SOON AFTERWARDS ANOTHER REPORTER WENT TO THE SAME
BUT I CAN'T NOW O.K. NO TROUBLE THERE HE WAS
TEN YEARS AFTER THE WINDRUSH HAD ARRIVED THE FIRST RACE RIOTS IN NOTTING HILL
NOBODY SUPPORTS THEM MY LESSONS AND RE MY LIST NO ONE YOU CAN'T GO HOME OR MY EYES SURROUNDED BY YOUNG EIGHTEEN YEAR JAZZ OR ERLING BUTLER ZEN
TEN YEARS LATER ENOCH POWELL PREDICTED IMMIGRATION WOULD CAUSE RIVERS OF BLOOD TO FLOW BUT HE WAS WRONG
THERE HAVE BEEN MORE RACE RIOTS BUT THEY'D BEEN MODEST AFFAIRS COMPARED WITH MANY OTHER COUNTRIES THE LAST OF THEM IN BRADFORD OR OFFICERS HAVE COME UNDER ATTACK FROM GROUPS OF YOUTHS
ARMED WITH BRICKS BASEBALL BATS HAMMERS AND PETROL
THAT WAS TWO THOUSAND AND ONE FIFTEEN YEARS LATER THERE'S NO RIOTING HERE IN WEST YORKSHIRE BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT NOW FROM HOW IT WAS BEFORE THE IMMIGRANT STARTED COMING
MOHAMMED IQBAL GREW UP IN KEIGHLEY HIS FAMILY HAD MOVED HERE FROM KASHMIR IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WE'VE BEEN DRIVING FOR A WHILE NOW I'VE NOT SEEN A SINGLE AGENT THINGS NO HOT OR WHITE PEOPLE YEAH YOU GET THAT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IT WAS ECONOMICS THAT WAS DRIVING ITS MOST OF THEM CAME WITH THE VIEW TO COME WORK SAVE AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY COULDN'T SEND BACK AND SUPPORT THE FAMILY
AND THAT MEANT LIVING WITH FRIENDS AND YOU KNOW NOT TO A ROOM OF ALL
BUT AS THEIR FAMILIES STARTED JOINING AND PROSPERITY GOING TO KIM THERE WHERE THEY DID START MOVING UP TO THE AUDIENCE THAT NO YOU WOULDN'T SEE IS SOME OF THE ASIANS LIVING IN SOME OF THE POSHEST PARTS OF CUTE AS WELL
ON THE RELATIVELY POOR SIDE CLEARLY UGLY MAY END IN INNER CITY AREAS THAT IS STIFF LARGE SORT OF SEGREGATION WERE PREDOMINANT IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY LIVES AND WHERE THEIR LEISURE AND COMMUNITY
JUST COME INTO THE TOWN CENTRE THIS NOW FROM NOW ON IS GOING TO BE ALMOST ENTIRELY ASIAN IT ON MY FAMILY USED TO HAVE A TAKEAWAY JUST ACROSS THERE YOU GET LOTS OF TAKEAWAYS RESTAURANTS FABRIC TAKEAWAYS IN THIS AREA THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN BRADFORD'S PROBABLY GOT MORE THAT'S IN AN ENGINE FOR THERE'S LOADS AND LOADS OF THEM
PLENTY OF RESTAURANTS TO CUT ABOVE YOUR AVERAGE TAKEAWAY IS THE SHOMER OWNED BY GOOD LUMBER ARE BADLY HE ACKNOWLEDGES IT HAS BECOME A DEEPLY SEGREGATED AREA BUT HE LOVES LIVING HERE NONETHELESS
WHY THE FREEDOM THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH
YOU HAVE ACTUALLY THE LAWS THEY PROTECT YOU ALL THE TIME YOUR RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED OTHER TYPE OF FREEDOM YOU YEARN FOR WHEN YOU'RE IN OTHER PLACES
ALMOST ALL THE CUSTOMERS OF WHITE AND THIS BEING A MONDAY EVENING
THE CURRY CLUB HAS ARRIVED A GROUP OF MIDDLE AGED LADIES WHO'VE BEEN COMING HERE FOR DONKEY'S YEARS I GO AWAY WELCOME BACK FROM YOUR HOLIDAY
THANK YOU YOU MUST BE GROWN TO ACCEPT THE RACIAL SEGREGATION IN THIS AREA BUT THEY'RE NOT ALL ENTIRELY HAPPY ABOUT IT PART OF THE PROBLEM IT'S A LOT OF THEM DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH
IF THEY SPOKE ENGLISH THEM GET OUT AND TRY AND COMMUNITY
OUT IN THE SCHOOL OF THE AIR IN KEIGHLEY AND THE CHILDREN SPEAK ENGLISH
BUT BECAUSE THE MOTHERS DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH THEY WENT HOME AND SPOKE PUNJAR
WHY SHOULD THEY HAVE TO LEARN ENGLISH BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE LIVES BETTER THEY COULD WHAT'S IT MEAN
IT'S KATE LIVED IN INDIA BUT THEY DIDN'T INTEGRATE IT'S JUST HISTORY REPEATING
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS KEIGHLEY BRAND FOR THE WHOLE AREA WOULD BE RICHER IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS IF THERE WAS NOT AT THIS
WE'VE GOT AN INTEGRATED MORE YEAH DEFINITELY THEY ARE STILL COMING IN THE IMMIGRANTS IF YOU READ THE PAPERS
SO I THINK WE SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO IMPOSE OUR BORDERS
LEAVE IT AS IT IS FOR THE MOMENT
OUR RESOURCES ARE SO STRETCHED OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM OUR HEALTH SYSTEM
WE HAVE ONLY A FINITE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND WAS SO LIBERAL THING THAT EVERYBODY MUST BE EQUAL
I DON'T WORRY BUT IN THE FUTURE THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH MONEY FOR WORKING CLASS WHITE CHILDREN
AND THEY'RE THE ONES I THINK ARE SUFFERING REALLY POOR WORKING CLASS WHITE CHILDREN
IN THE CENTRE OF KEIGHLEY REALLY
AND WHAT ABOUT THE POOR ASIAN CHILDREN THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM TO SOME OF WHOM FEEL ALIENATED FROM THE WHITES AND AS MOHAMMED IQBAL TOLD ME RESENTFUL I THINK THE RESENTMENT LARGELY ARISES BECAUSE OF POLITICAL AND CULTURAL ISSUES IT'S MORE TO DO WITH THAT
THE BROADER IMAGE OFF SAY ISLAM AND WHAT'S GOING ON POLITICALLY ACROSS THE WORLD THEY'RE THERE A SADIST DIFFERENCES DEVELOPING YOUNG
THERE ARE FOUR BIG BUILDINGS DOMINATING THE CENTRE OF KEIGHLEY THREE SUPERMARKETS AND A MOSQUE
OH NO IT'S HIM IS MUHAMMAD ALI
HOSTILITY BUT EQUALLY DONE THAT YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THERE'S SOME HOSTILITY WITH SOME ASIAN PEOPLE AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE DON'T THINK HOSTILITY IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S EXISTED SINCE MANKIND EXISTED BUT THAT'S NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM BASED ON AN ISLAMIC TEACHING THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE AND I THINK THERE IS AND FIND THAT INCREASE IS IGNORANCE IN THE FEAR OF ISLAM BUT THEY DON'T KNOW ISLAM IF YOU'RE MUSLIM BUT THEY DON'T KNOW MUSLIMS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU'VE GONE FOR THE MOSS TODAY YOU'VE BEEN INVITED HIM SOMEBODY WAS NOT COME TO THE MOSQUE TO MATCH IT WAS A MILITARY CAMP GOING ON IN HERE
AND THE MOSQUE IS TRAINING UP JIHAD IS WE'RE GOING TO START BLOWING THEMSELVES UP BUT YOU COME IN AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT WHATSOEVER YOU SEE CARPET YOU SEE WALD YOU SEE CHAIRS IN A SHORT WHILE TO THE WORSHIPPERS COMING IN BUT NOT EVERYBODY GETS TO SEE THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE THE STEP LIKE YOU HAVE TO COME INTO THE MOSS AND SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON HERE DOES IT SUDDENLY THAT THAT WHEN YOU COME INTO A TOWN LIKE HEATHROW YOU LIKE BRADFORD YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RACES LIVING
TOGETHER PUT IT THIS WAY WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY WOULD I LIKE TO SEE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SOCIETY WHERE YOU HAVE NON MUSLIMS AND MUSLIMS INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT AT THE SAME TIME
OF BEING ALLOWED TO ADOPT AND KEEP THEIR OWN IDENTITY WHICH IS REFLECTIVE OF THEIR BELIEFS THAT WOULD BEEN A BEAUTIFUL SITUATION WHERE THERE'S NO COMPROMISE THERE NOT A SIMULATION TAKING PLACE BUT THEY CAN INTERACT AND SHARE FACILITIES AND SUCH THINGS BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOLD STRONGLY THEIR OWN IDENTITY
BEHIND THE MOSQUE IS WHERE THE MILL WORKERS ONCE LIVE TIGHTLY PACKED BACK TO BACK TERRACED HOUSES WITH CLOTHESLINE STRUNG ACROSS THE STREET AND WASHING STILL HANGING ON THEM EVEN THOUGH IT'S DARK
ONLY ASIAN PEOPLE LIVE HERE
I WANTED TO TALK TO SOME OF THE BOYS AND YOUNG MEN HANGING AROUND LOOKING BOARD THAT I MADE THE MISTAKE OF TELLING THEM THAT IT WAS FULL OF B.B.C. REPORT ON IMMIGRATION THEY DIDN'T LIKE THAT THEY REFUSED EVEN TO LETTER SWITCH ON A RECORDER WHY TALK TO US ABOUT IMMIGRATION THEY DEMANDED WE'RE NOT IMMIGRANTS WE'VE ALWAYS LIVED HERE
BUT THESE NACRE WHO OWNS A LOCAL TAXI FIRM WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO TALK HE SAYS IT'S NOT THE ASIANS TO BLAME FOR SEGREGATION
IT'S NOW THERE'S YOU THERE CAUSING THE DIVISION IT'S THE WHITE PEOPLE OF COURSE IT WAS RETIRED FLIGHT LIKE FLY THAT IS OR WHERE HE IS
COUNCIL ESTATES WHERE I'M NOT WELCOME SO IT'S NOT OVER THE ASIANS ARE CREATING THE DIVISION OR SECULARISM
HE IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW FOR DECADES GENERATIONS THE DEBATE ABOUT IMMIGRATION IN THIS COUNTRY HAS CENTRED ON DIFFERENCES ALIEN CULTURES AND HABITS AND RELIGION ABOVE ALL THE COLOUR OF THE EMIGRANT SKIN
BUT THAT'S CHANGING A SUCCESSION OF LAWS OUTLAWING RACIAL DISCRIMINATION HAVE WORKED THEIR MAGIC RACIST MOVEMENTS THAT HAVE TRIED TO BECOME GREAT NATIONAL PARTIES HAVE FAILED MISERABLY VOCABULARY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED WHERE SHOCKED WHEN WE HEAR THE N. WORD
THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MIGRANTS AT THE HEART OF THIS REFERENDUM DEBATE AND MOST OF US BRITISH IS THAT THEY ARE POOR
AND NOWHERE IS THAT MORE VISIBLE THAN HERE IN THE DERBYSHIRE TOWN OF SHIREBROOK THE LOCALS KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ON THE FRONT LINE IN THE GRATE
NOW THAT SOUNDS FLOOD AT DAVID STRAW IS THE LOCAL BUTCHER HE'S LIVED IN SHIREBROOK FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS WITH HIS WIFE
THIS TIME LAST YEAR THAT MARK THE PLACE WAS TERRIBLE WASN'T IT YOU COULDN'T GO OVER THOSE CANS EVERYWHERE THE WHAT DRINK THEN PEOPLE CAN'T GO INTO THE DOCTOR'S COS THERE'S THAT MANY
PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF REALLY IT'S NOT PLUS THE POLE HE SURE IT'S EUROPEAN IT'S JUST COS IT'S JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE FOR FACILITIES AND THAT'S THAT IN A SCHOOL OF THE STRAP
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY WELL IT'S RACIST NOT TO ONE OF THE FOREIGNERS TO COME IN HERE
NO NOT AT ALL ISN'T IT NOT RAISED AT ALL I MEAN IT'S THE PALATIAL BIGGER I ALLOWED IF YOU WANT TO OUT OF IN MARKET
BUT IT ISN'T GOING TO HELP HIM OUT BECAUSE HE'S SHOOTING THE PRICE AS WELL I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY HE'S MAKING THERE PLEASE RICHARD
NO BECAUSE A LOT OF US THE MONITORS AS THE EUROPEANS ARE GOOD IN THE OLD SHOPS SO KEEP HIM INTO THEIR OWN COMMUNITY
WEAK COFFEE THREE SUGARS MATE
THE MAN WHO'S LEADING THE FIGHT TO CUT THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS IS TROIKA SAYING HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THINGS HAVE IMPROVED QUITE A BIT SINCE LAST SUMMER AT THE IMMIGRANTS ARE MAKING A REAL NUISANCE LIKE CELL URINATING AND DEFECATING IN THE STREETS DRINKING A LOT OF FIGHTING
AND THE POLICE WERE TOO SLOW STOPPING THEM THE PROBLEM WOULD BE BETTER IF IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THIS SLIGHT SMALL MINORITY ARE TROUBLE CAUSES I THINK THERE COULD BE A LOT OF TROUBLE JUST ONE REALLY BAD INCIDENT
TO THE WRONG PERSON EACH BUILT AND THAT THEY COULD BE BUT CONSEQUENCES VIOLETTE'S KICK OFF YEAH WE'VE HAD WELL OVER OUR CULTURE IN THIS AREA THIS IS NOT A RACE HIS QUOTE
WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT THOUSANDS IN THIS VILLAGE
NINETY FIVE OR MORE PER CENT ON ON ABSOLUTELY LOVELY FAMILIES THEY'RE ALL THERE DOM THEY'VE COME MY BECAME MONEY FOR THAT FOR THE FAMILIES WHICH I WOULD DO IF THEY WERE NO WE'RE COVER HERE WE'RE TO ITS LIMIT
OBVIOUSLY CAN'T THINK THEN MUCH GOOD WILL KEEP ON AND WHAT WE'LL MANAGE WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT BUT WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE
SHIREBROOK AND KEIGHLEY TWO TONGUES AT DIFFERENT STAGES IN THEIR IMMIGRATION EVOLUTION TO SMALL TOWNS THAT'S IT
DRIVE ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS SO FROM SHIREBROOK AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT CITIES AND LONDON IS WHERE VAST NUMBERS
FOR EVERY TEN FOREIGNERS WHO COME TO LIVE IN BRITAIN
TWO OF THEM ARE JULIANA SCAPPI IN FROM BRAZIL WHO WORKS FOR THE N.H.S. AND MAGIC OF MATHS
AS A STUDENT FOURTEEN YEARS AGO FROM
TOOK UP BUILDING TO MAKE SOME MONEY NOW HE'S GOING
I DIDN'T COME HERE WITH MY FAMILY TO GET A HOUSE OR A COUNCIL HOUSE OR WHATEVER I CAME HERE TO STUDY AND WORK IN I THINK THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO'S COME HERE
WITH THAT PURPOSE TO LIVE OFF BENEFITS I UNDERSTAND THAT LOADS OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE FINANCE AND I THINK I'LL BE ALWAYS A FOREIGNER BUT I'VE NEVER FELL OUT THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT HAPPY BECAUSE
I WAS HERE AS AN IMMIGRANT THIS E.U. DEBATE SHELVES THAT THERE'S ALWAYS AN ELEMENT OF PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER
WHETHER THE POOR DES THERE OR NOT I THINK HE REFERENDUM THIS MANAGED TO DIVIDE PEOPLE
MAKE YOU FEEL MORE OF A FOREIGNER I THINK IT DID YEAH IT'S A LITTLE BIT
DIFFICULT TO HEAR THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT YOU ARE A BURDEN BECAUSE PEOPLE TEND TO GENERALISE SORRY ALL THE IMMIGRANTS A BURDEN AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK I AM I THINK IN GENERAL BRITISH ATTITUDES TOWARDS IMMIGRATION
VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AND OPEN MINDED BUT RECENTLY IT'S SORT OF HAD BECOME A BATTLEGROUND FOR POLITICIANS AND IT'S A BIT OF A SHAME THAT WE AS CITIZENS AND AS IMMIGRANTS AS WELL NOT FAKING
THERE'S THE BAIT BACK TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP US TO MOVE ON AND DO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIGHT ONE ANOTHER AND FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'D BEEN DOING WITH INCREASING VENOM THERE SINCE THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BEGAN
STRIP AWAY ALL THE DUBIOUS STATISTICS AND BROKEN PROMISES AND AT THE HEART OF THE DEBATE IS WHETHER THIS COUNTRY SHOULD CONTINUE TO GROW AT ANYTHING LIKE THE RATE OF THE PAST FEW YEARS SHOULD BE TRYING TO CLOSE OUR DOORS OR KEEP THEM OPEN OR AT LEAST EXERCISE MORE CONTROL OVER WHO SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN
THE BRICKS IT CAM SAYS IF WE LEAVE WE HAVE MORE CONTROL BUT TRY GETTING THEM TO PUT A FIGURE ON HOW MANY THEY'D ALLOW IN
THE TORY MINISTER PRETTY PATEL IS ONE OF THE LEADING VOICES I DON'T HAVE A FIGURE AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS ABOUT HAVING A FIGURE AND IMMIGRATION TARGET I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THE BRITISH PUBLIC WANT TO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY IS IN CONTROL OF THEIR BORDERS AND THEIR IMMIGRATION POLICY AND SYSTEM AND IMPORTANTLY THAT WE ARE NOT AT THE BEHEST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHEN IT COMES TO DETERMINE DETERMINING THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT COME INTO BRITAIN
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL WHO WANTS US TO REMAIN IN THE YOU WON'T PUT A FIGURE ON IT EITHER BUT THAT'S BECAUSE HE THINKS IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW WELL OUR ECONOMY IS DOING AND HOW ATTRACTIVE THIS COUNTRY IS TO THOSE WHO MIGHT WANT TO COME HERE I THINK THERE'S A NATURAL LIMIT DEPENDENT ON THE THE HOW THE ECONOMY'S DOING AND THAT'S BEEN A HISTORY FOR A CENTURY AND A HALF OF PEOPLE
HAVE COME HERE WHEN THE ECONOMY IS THRIVING AND THERE'S A NEED FOR LABOUR AND WHEN THERE ISN'T ACTUALLY OUR OWN POPULATION AND IS THEN SHIFTED ALL OVER THE WORLD SO I THINK IT'S A NATURAL LIMIT THAT ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE WHICH IS LARGELY DEPEND ON THE PROSPERITY OF THE ECONOMY SHOE PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE WITH THAT IMMIGRANTS WANT TO GO TO COUNTRIES THAT ARE RICHER THAN THEIR OWN PUT ENTIRELY OBVIOUS REASONS THEY WANT A BETTER LIFE SO IT'S A BRITISH ECONOMY'S DOING WELL AND JOBS ARE BEING CREATED WE CAN EXPECT MORE PEOPLE TO COME HERE
THAT RAISES SOME IMPORTANT CONCERNS EVEN IF THE JOBS ARE HERE WILL THEY WORK FOR LESS AND DRIVE DOWN WAGES WHERE WILL THEY GO WHICH PART OF BRITAIN AND WHAT AFFECT WILL THEIR ARRIVAL
SHY BOOK AND KEIGHLEY ARE PROOF THAT IF YOU ALLOW DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS TO SETTLE IN ONE SMALL TOWN THE LOCAL PEOPLE PAY A PRICE
BUT ON A NATIONAL SCALE IT'S NOT SO EASY TO FIND COLD HARD STATISTICS MADELEINE ASSUMPTION IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE MIGRATION OBSERVATORY AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY IN ORDER TO ANSWER VERY SPECIFIC POLICY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF A PARTICULAR GROUP ON A VERY PARTICULAR SERVICE
THE DATA THAT YOU WOULD NEED IT IS NOT ALWAYS THERE IF YOU LOOK AT PUBLIC SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE N.H.S. THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY DATA COLLECTED ABOUT THE NATIONALITY OF A PERSON WHO GOES TO THE N.H.S. TO USE SERVICES A PARTICULAR POINT OF TIME AND THERE ARE PROBABLY GOOD REASONS FOR THAT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF EMIGRATION THERE IS A LOT OF QUITE GOOD EVIDENCE ABOUT THE IMPACTS LIBERATION AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FIELDS
TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO GENERALISE MOST OF THEM HAVE FOUND THAT THE IMPACT OF IMMIGRATION ARE ACTUALLY SURPRISINGLY SMALL AT THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE POLICY MAKERS HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ALL THE TIME AND ALL SORTS OF FIELDS WHERE THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
BENGALI CELEBRITY CATALAN CHINESE SEE ENGLISH FRENCH GREEK HINDI ITALIAN KOREAN LATVIAN POLISH PORTUGUESE RUSSIANS AMANDA PHILLIPS IN THE PLAYGROUND OF OLD FORD PRIMARY SCHOOL IN TOWER HAMLETS IN EAST LONDON READING OFF SOME OF THE THIRTY TWO LANGUAGES THE CHILDREN HEAR SPEAK
PHILLIPS WAS THE HEAD TEACHER WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE FIVE YEARS AGO AND SHE'S NOW THE EXECUTIVE PRINCIPLE BEFORE SCHOOLS WE SEE GROUPS OF PUPILS WHO WOULD
PLAYING WITH THEIR OWN COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT'S WHO THEIR PARENTS KNOW FOR EXAMPLE BUT WE ALSO SEE OTHER GROUPS OF PUPILS WHO
WE HAVE THE WHOLE RANGE JUST LET ME MISSY IN THE CLASSROOM PLAYING TOGETHER IN THE PARK OR GOING SHOPPING TOGETHER THE OLDER CHILDREN ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON
I GREW UP IN EAST LONDON IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES I REMEMBER IS THAT I REMEMBER BEING CALLED NAMES MCCLINTOCK RUNNING ON NOW CELEEN OGILBY HAS TWO CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL SHE WAS BORN IN BANGLADESH HE GREW UP HERE
I'M OPTIMISTIC COS I THINK THAT AS A COUNTRY
THE FACT THAT I GREW UP ON THE COUNCIL ESTATE
I GOT A MASTERS AND I GOT A GOOD EDUCATION AND I'VE MANAGED TO TRAVEL AND WORK ELSEWHERE SAYS SOMETHING AND YOUR PARENTS OF COURSE WOULD HAVE BEEN MY PARENTS I PUT IN MY FARTS FASTER MY MY MY MOTHER IS PROUD AND SHE TOOK
THEY WERE FIRST GENERATION IMMIGRANTS YET IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO THE CHILDREN
PROOF THAT IMMIGRATION WORKS NO PROOF THAT IMMIGRATION CANDLE
WHAT COUNTRY WOULDN'T WANT MISSUS GO OVER HER AS A CITIZEN
HERE'S WHAT'S INTERESTING I SUPPOSE WELL OVER FIFTY PEOPLE WHILE WE'VE BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS REPORT AND ALL HAD THEIR OWN EXAMPLES OF THE POSITIVE AFFECTED IMMIGRATION ON THEIR OWN LIVES INCLUDING PEOPLE LIKE PRETTY PATEL A GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE
MY PARENTS CAME TO BRITAIN FROM EAST AFRICA THROUGH THE EXTRAS THAT TOOK PLACE THROUGH THE IDI AMIN EXPULSIONS AND OF COURSE THAT WAS A HUGE GENERATION OF NOW BRITISH INDIANS WHO INTEGRATED IN OUR COMMUNITIES CONTRIBUTED TO A PUBLIC LIVE THE ECONOMY AS WELL FOCUS ON EDUCATING THEIR CHILDREN AND ACTUALLY BECAME BRITISH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE REFERENDUM DEBATE THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL
MY NEIGHBOUR IS AFRICA BEING ON ONE SIDE WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN ANOTHER ACROSS FOR ME THERE'S A PUNJABI SIKH NEXT TO THAT FAMILY PAKISTANI MUSLIMS ACROSS THE ROAD IS A TRADITIONAL BRITISH WHITE FAMILY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME
YOU KNOW WE RUB ALONG VERY WELL AND WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT'S HOW OUR SOCIETY'S EVOLVING THIS ONE POTENT WORD THAT DEFINES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES IN THE DEBATE CONTROL HOW TO CONTROL THE NUMBERS COMING IN AND WHAT HAPPENS IF WE STAY IN A UNION THAT INSISTS ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE
THE PRESSURE GROUP MIGRATION WATCH WHICH HAS DECLARED ALLEGIANCE TO NEITHER SIDE HAS PRODUCED ITS OWN FORECAST OF HOW OUR POPULATION MIGHT INCREASE IN THE YEARS TO COME IT WAS FOUNDED BY THE FORMER DIPLOMAT ANDREW GREEN NO LAW DEGREE
EVEN IF WE REMAIN AT THE PRESENT RATE OF NET MIGRATION INCLUDING NON E.U. WHICH IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR
WE WILL THE U.K. HAVE A POPULATION OF EIGHTY MILLION IN TWENTY FORTY
THAT'S WELL WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF ANYBODY UNDER FIFTY THAT WOULD MAKE US PROBABLY THE MOST POPULOUS COUNTRY IN EUROPE BECAUSE GERMANY HAS BEEN GOING DOWN THE MOST CROWDED COUNTRY IN EUROPE APART FROM AN ISLAND BY MALT
AND IT WOULD CHANGE THE WHOLE SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT OF OUR COUNTRY AND NOT THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY OF EVERY COUNTRY IS CHANGE
WHEN THE WINDRUSH SAILED INTO TILBURY IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT THE POPULATION WAS ABOUT FIFTY MILLION TODAY IT'S SIXTY FIVE MILLION AND IMMIGRATION HAS PLAYED A LARGE PART IN THERE
IN KEIGHLEY WE BROUGHT TOGETHER A GROUP OF PEOPLE MOSTLY OF WHOM WERE BORN BEFORE THOSE IMMIGRANTS ARRIVED FROM THE CARIBBEAN
AND WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IMMIGRATION HAS MEANT TO THEM AND THEIR LIVES
WHERE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PREJUDICE HASN'T IN THE PAST BETWEEN PEOPLE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY
AND I THINK THAT TAKES SOME GETTING OVER AND WE ARE BEGINNING TO GET PAST THAT NOW AND PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE MAKES YEAH THEY FEEL WE'RE GOING TO
WOULD YOU GO BUY IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT COMMUNITY YOU'VE GONE WHERE WE HAD ON PEOPLE AND I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THE STEM WITH THEIR OWN
GIVE HIM TO MIX BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
AND I THINK HE'S CROSS THAT AFRAID OF HIM I DON'T KNOW THE WHAT I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS A GREAT BIG JOKE TO SPOT THE BLACK WOMAN IT'S NICKELS OR WASN'T MAYBE ABEL'S AROUND AND HOW DID PEOPLE REACT TO YOU BEING MARRIED TO A WHITE MAN AT FIRST WE DID GET SOME LUCK
SO NOW IT'S JUST A NATURAL THING YEARS AGO I FOSTERED CHILDREN EARLY ON WAS TOOK YEAH SHOULDN'T YOUNG
BUT EGGS THROWN AT ME WHEN I GOT NO ORTIS IS STUCK ON MY DOING ON A GIRL HAVE RHYTHM
WELL THAT'S THAT DON'T THAT MEN IN THAT'S ALL GONE IT'S GONE
I OFTEN WONDER WHAT THEIR FAIL NOW THAT I LIKE THAT WITH NO AT THAT TIME BUT GREAT DOING THE ENGLISH COMMUNITY AND WE NOW THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE OF WRONG BY DIFFER
PETE PAUL BECAUSE PUTTING IT BLUNTLY THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM
YES THAT'S MY POINT WE'RE ALL PUT ON EARTH TO BE RIGHT LONG WAY SHALL WE HAVE TO LOOK AFTER ALL I MEAN IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD TODAY THAN WHAT WE REMEMBER
I MEAN I'VE MET FLOWERY LOVELY PEOPLE DO YOU HAVE MET A LOT AS YOU SAY BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS OLD AND I THINK IT'S RIGHT WE WANT TO LEARN DELIVER ONE
WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IN THIS REPORT HE'S ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS WHAT EFFECT AS IMMIGRATION HAD ON THIS COUNTRY ADEQUATE AFRAID OF IT WHY
THE FIRST IS RELATIVELY EASY IMMIGRATION HAS HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT ON US ON OUR ATTITUDES TO PEOPLE WHOM MOST WOULD ONCE HAVE DISMISSED AS FOREIGNERS
WE BECOME TO AN EXTENT UNIMAGINABLE AFTER THE WAR A MULTICULTURAL COUNTRY WE MOSTLY RUB ALONG PRETTY WELL
IF WE'RE AFRAID OF WHERE GROWING NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS MADE TAKE US THAT FEAR IS BASED ON SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT'S ABOUT HOW IT WILL AFFECT OUR ECONOMIC AND PHYSICAL WELLBEING GETTING OUR CHILDREN INTO A DECENT SCHOOL WAITING TOO LONG IN A G.P. SURGERY COMPETING FOR JOBS AND HOUSES
IT'S PARTLY ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE A COUPLE OF THOUSAND IMMIGRANTS ARRIVING IN LONDON IS BARELY NOTICEABLE IN A SMALL TOWN IN YORKSHIRE OR DERBYSHIRE IT CAN BE OVERWHELMING
I'VE BEEN REPORTING FOR THE B. B. C. FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS WE'VE NEVER HAD A DEBATE QUITE LIKE THIS
WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE REFERENDUM THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED WILL RESONATE IN THIS COUNTRY PERHAPS FOR GENERATIONS TO COME
