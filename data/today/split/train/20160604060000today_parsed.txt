A DEVASTATING FIGHTER HE BEAT THE PREVIOUSLY INVINCIBLE SONNY LISTON IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR FOUGHT A STRING OF THRILLING FIGHTS WITH JOE FRAZIER AND STOPPED GEORGE FOREMAN IN THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE IN ZAIRE BUT HIS PUBLIC LIFE WAS AS FASCINATING AND CONTROVERSIAL AS HIS PERFORMANCE INSIDE THE RING

JOE WILSON LOOKS BACK AT THE LIFE OF ONE OF SPORT'S MOST EXTRAORDINARY FIGURES NO ONE TALKED THE TALK LIKE MUHAMMAD ALI NO ONE FOUGHT THE FIGHTS LIKE HIM HE TOLD THE WORLD HE WOULD FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY AND STING LIKE A BEE AND THEN HE DID IT

HE WOULD TAKE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT LIKE ANY OTHER OPPONENT A LONG BANNED FROM THE RING FOLLOWED BUT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR HE TRAVELLED TO ZAIRE FOR PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS BOXING MATCH OF THE MALL THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE
UP AGAINST THE YOUNGER BIGGER GEORGE FOREMAN ALI LEANED BACK ON THE ROPES ABSORBED PUNCHES UNTIL HIS OPPONENT WAS EXHAUSTED IT WAS DARING TO THE POINT OF RECKLESS ALLEY CALLED IT ROPE A DOPE IT WERE
MORE MATCHES THEN FOLLOWED TOO MANY MORE THE SYMPTOMS OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE SOON BECAME OBVIOUS BUT MUHAMMAD ALI HAD ALREADY DECIDED HOW HE WOULD BE REMEMBERED WHATEVER BALLET I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I AM BIG RADIUS
ALI FAMOUSLY TAUNTED HIS OPPONENT GEORGE FOREMAN BEFORE THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE BETRAYING THE MORE POWERFUL FIGHTER AS A LUMBERING OAF BUT THIS MORNING FOREMAN TOLD THE B.B.C. HE HAD NOTHING BUT LOVE AND RESPECT FOR ALI
OH AYE WHAT ALI WAS THE COASTS OF PUBLICITY
ROLL SOME WASTER BARFING
A BIG CELEBRITY
BUT IT'S BEEN A GREAT PART OF MY LIFE BECAUSE
LITHIUM IS LIKE
ANOTHER FORMER CHAMPION MIKE TYSON HAS REACTED TO ALI'S DEATH WITH THE MESSAGE GOD CAME FOR HIS CHAMPION SO LONG GREAT ONE
IN OTHER NEWS THE OFFICIAL REFERENDUM LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS HAD THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD USE SOME OF THE MONEY SAVED FROM QUITTING THE EUROPEAN UNION TO GIVE THE N.H.S. AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS EXTRA A WEEK BY TWENTY TWENTY THE FIGURE WAS RELEASED AFTER THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO FOR APPEARED ON THE SECOND MAJOR T. V. EVENT OF THE CAMPAIGN ON SKY NEWS ARGUING THE CASE FOR BRECHT'S AT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS DESCRIBED THE N.H.S. SPENDING CLAIM AS TOTALLY DISHONEST A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN REPORTS
MICHAEL GO VOICE REPEATEDLY CHALLENGED TO NAME A MAJOR ECONOMIC INSTITUTION THAT HAD BACKED BRECK'S IT HIS RESPONSE SET THE TONE FOR MUCH OF HIS SUBSEQUENT ARGUMENT HE WAS GLAD THAT MAJOR ORGANISATIONS DID NOT SUPPORT LEAVING THE E.U. HE SAID BECAUSE THESE WERE THE ELITES PEOPLE WITH AN AGENDA WHO'D BEEN CONSISTENTLY WRONG IN THE PAST AN AUDIENCE MEMBER SUGGESTED MY GAVE HADN'T SET OUT A DETAILED ECONOMIC PLAN IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FIRST WORLD WAR GENERAL
YOU'RE SAYING OVER THE TOP MAN BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S ON THE FRONT LINE OR WHAT THE CASUALTY RIGHT WILL BE IN THE CONFLICT SUCCUMB BUT MISTER GO SAID HE HAD FAITH IN THE INGENUITY OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE
IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE AND WE TAKE BACK CONTROL THEN WE CAN SHAPE AN ECONOMIC POLICY WHICH IS IN OUR INTERESTS BRYN'S BEEN STRONG IN THE PAST AND BE STRONG IN THE FUTURE
AFTER THE PROGRAMME VOTE LEAVE SAID THAT E.U. WITHDRAWAL WOULD ALLOW AN EXTRA ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A WEEK TO BE SPENT ON THE N.H.S. BY TWENTY TWENTY THE REMAIN SIDE CALLED THE CLAIM TOTALLY DISHONEST SAYING THEIR OPPONENTS WERE WRITING CHEQUES THEY KNEW WOULD BOUNCE
ALL SIX LIVING FORMER LABOUR LEADERS HAVE JOINED FORCES TO PERSUADE THE PARTY SUPPORTERS TO BACK STAYING IN THE E.U. THERE'S BEEN RISING CONCERN AMONG LABOUR REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS THAT THE PARTY HAS FAILED TO PERSUADE IT'S TRADITIONAL BASE OF THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. IN HER SPEECH LATER TODAY GORDON BROWN WILL SAY MEMBERSHIP OFFERS GREATER SECURITY AGAINST TERRORISM AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
A STUDY IN THE UNITED STATES SAYS TARGETING CANCER DRUGS TO SPECIFIC WEAKNESSES IN A PATIENT'S TUMOUR COULD BE UP TO SIX TIMES AS EFFECTIVE AS TRADITIONAL METHODS A TEAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOOKED AT THE TREATMENT OF THIRTEEN THOUSAND PATIENTS JAMES GALLAGHER REPORTS FROM THE WORLD'S BIGGEST CANCER CONFERENCE IN CHICAGO
PRECISION MEDICINE IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING FIELDS IN CANCER RESEARCH THE IDEAS TO TAKE THE D.N.A. OF EVERY PATIENT'S TUMOUR HUNT FOR ITS SPECIFIC WEAK SPOTS AND THEN TARGET THERAPIES TO KILL THE CANCER DATE ON HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS PRESENTED AT THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY SHOW THIRTY ONE PER CENT OF TUMOUR SHRANK WHEN A PRECISION APPROACH WAS USED
COMPARED WITH JUST SIX PERCENT OF THE TIME WHEN THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO MATCH DRUG IN TUMOUR SOME PATIENTS ARE ALREADY BENEFITING FROM PRECISION DRUGS LIKE HERCEPTIN IN BREAST CANCER BUT CANCER RESEARCH U.K. SAYS A REVOLUTION IN ANALYSING D.N.A. IS LEADING TO A NEW ERA FOR ALL CANCERS
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ARMY LAW DAMMIT HAS CALLED FOR A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO THE DEATHS OF FOUR YOUNG ARMY RECRUITS AT THE DEEPCUT BARRACKS IN SURREY TWO DECADES AGO YESTERDAY A CORONER FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD PRIVATE CHERYL JAMES HAD BEEN UNLAWFULLY KILLED AT THEIR BASE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE BUT HE CONCLUDED THE ARMY HAD FAILED IN ITS DUTY OF CARE TO YOUNG RECRUITS AT THE BASE LAW DOWN AT THE ARMY HAD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH THE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND BULLYING
CATHY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN I AM THE GREATEST HE TOLD US AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SOON ALMOST NO ONE EVEN THOUGHT OF DISAGREEING MUHAMMAD ALI WAS NOT JUST THE GREATEST BOXER OF ALL TIME
HE WANTS TO MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD THE GREATEST ICON FOR BLACK MEN AND WOMEN FIGHTING FOR THEIR RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE STATUS OF PEOPLE OF COLOUR FOR MUSLIMS ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR THOSE WHO OPPOSED THE VIETNAM WAR FOR THOSE PUBLICLY FACING UP TO WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN
BUT NEVER WAS FOR HIM A HUMILIATING ILLNESS IT ALL BEGAN IN THE RING OF COURSE IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR A YOUNG MAN KNOWN THEN AS CASSIUS CLAY SHOCKED THE WORLD BY DEFEATING SONNY LISTON
THE GREAT BACK THAT WE HAVE HERE WE ARE DO WE HAVE A BAD ONE OF ME BIT OF FUN IN THE FRONT AND I DON'T WANT TO DO YOUR DOLL I'M NOT A BEATLE PLAYED AT THE HEART OF IT WHEN I WENT BACK OUT THERE LET ME HELP YOU THEN NOW YOU'VE GOT ME WONDER ABOUT THAT AT ALL A BURGLAR LOOK AT DOOR
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'D GET READY TO BAKE MY FAVOURITE YOU'VE GOT BEAT PUT THEM OUT A BIT BUT THE PEOPLE THEY COULD BE ALL RIGHT
YOU WANT TO GO TO HAPPEN QUITE FORGIVEN YOU DON'T REMEMBER DARREN ON THE KING AND
DURING THIS PROGRAMME WE'LL HEAR HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN IN HIS OWN WORDS WILL SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE HE INFLUENCE AND HE INSPIRED WE'RE JOINED NOW BY JAMES COOK A REPORTER IN THE UNITED STATES HE WAS OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL IN PHOENIX WHERE MUHAMMAD ALI HAD BEEN BEING TREATED AND ALSO BY MIKE CAN STELLA TO BE BUSY BOXING COMMENTATOR JAMES NO SURPRISE THIS NEWS BUT INEVITABLY STILL A SHOCK
YES THAT'S RIGHT NO SURPRISE AND MUHAMMAD ALI IN THE END FOR AN INCREDIBLY A LONG FIGHT HIS LONGEST FIGHT IN THE END AGAINST PARKINSON'S DISEASE WITH WHICH HE WAS DIAGNOSED IN
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN CLEAR THAT HE HAD BEEN SHOWING THE SYMPTOMS IN THE YEARS BEFORE THAT AS WELL AND HIS SPOKESMAN CONFIRMING THAT HE DIED THIS EVENING THAT IS TO SAY FRIDAY EVENING AT STILL AT ABOUT TEN PAST ELEVEN ON FRIDAY NIGHT HERE IN PHOENIX IN ARIZONA IT THE STATEMENT FROM THE FAMILY GOING ON TO SAY THAT MUHAMMED ALI'S FAMILY WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR THOUGHTS
PRAYERS AND SUPPORT AND WE'D LIKE TO ASK FOR PRIVACY AT THIS TIME THEY HAD GATHERED AT HIS BEDSIDE WE'RE TOLD THAT AFTER HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN WITH THAT A SPIRIT TREE PROBLEM REPORTEDLY
ON TUESDAY AND REALLY AMERICA HELD ITS BREATH AND HAD WILLED HIM TO TO WIN THIS LAST BOUT BUT IT WAS IT WAS NOT TO BE A MAN THAT MADE NICK SUCH AN INDELIBLE MARK ON THIS COUNTRY NOT JUST AS A SPORTSMAN NOT JUST AS A BRILLIANT BRILLIANT BOXER BUT BUT AS A SOCIAL ACTIVIST AS WELL AS YOU SAY IN TERMS OF HIS OF HIS APPROACH TO THE VIETNAM WAR IN WHICH HE REFUSED TO SERVE FAMOUSLY ON APRIL THE TWENTY EIGHTH NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN
CALLED FORWARD THREE TIMES HIS NAME IN THE DRAFT AND REFUSING TO STEP FORWARD HE'S SUFFERED FOR THAT HE HE LOST MORE THAN THREE YEARS OF BOXING AT THE PRIME OF HIS CAREER THE PRIME OF HIS OF HIS HEALTH AND HIS ABILITY BECAUSE OF HIS HIS BELIEFS AND HIS REFUSAL TO BEND TO THEM AND HE WANTS NICK FAMOUS FOR SO MANY QUOTES WHICH WOULD HEAR THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME AS YOU SAY BUT ONE THAT STANDS OUT FOR ME I THINK IN THIS CONTEXT I AM AMERICA
I'M THE PART YOU WON'T RECOGNISE BUT GET USED TO ME YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF A BLACK CONFIDENT AND COCKY AND MY GOODNESS THEY HAD TO GET USED TO HIM BUT THEY DID INDEED JAMES THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED MIKE ARE STELLA'S A SAYS THE B.B.C.'S BOXING COMMENTATOR AND JOINS US THEY'RE IN THE RING TO START WITH MIKE WHAT MADE HIM SO SPECIAL
WELL I THINK NO ONE IT BROUGHT SUCH COLOUR SUCH CONTROVERSY SUCH EXCITEMENT TO THE BIG BOXING STAGE AND HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS IN AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER CAME WHEN HE WAS UNDER THE MOST PRESSURE AND HOW HE RESPONDED WAS ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF GREATNESS AND YOU'RE HERE TODAY THAT HE HAD MANY OF THOSE HALLMARKS THREE TIMES THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD BEATING LEGENDARY FIGURES
SUCH AS ONE WE JUST HEARD FROM GEORGE FOREMAN JOE FRAZIER KEN NORTON SONNY LISTON THREE OF THOSE HE ACTUALLY BEAT TWICE MANY SPORTS STARS MEN AND WOMEN AT THE END OF THEIR CAREERS WOULD BE CONTENT TO HAVE A SINGLE BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THEIR CAREERS MUHAMMAD ALI FIRST SINGLE EVENTS
BOOKS DOCUMENTARIES SONGS WRITTEN ABOUT SINGLE FIGHTS FIGHTS LIKE THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE AGAINST GEORGE FOREMAN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE THRILLER IN MANILA A YEAR LATER AGAINST JOE FRAZIER
AND THE FIGHT OF THE CENTURY AFTER HE CAME BACK FROM EXILE HAVING REFUSED TO SERVE IN THE U.S. ARMY IN THE VIETNAM WAR IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AGAINST JOE FRAZIER AGAIN MIKE WE'RE NOW FAMILIAR WITH PEOPLE TAUNTING THEIR OPPONENTS BEFORE USUALLY FRANKLIN A FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE WAY LET'S JUST LISTEN TO ALI DO IT IN JUST A SECOND DID HE INVENT THIS SORT OF PRE MATCH BANTER
THIS IS THE LEGEND OF CASUALS CLAY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FINER IN THE WORLD TODAY
THE TOXIC GREAT DEAL AND BRAGS AND EDIE I'LL BE MUSCULAR PIPES THAT'S INCREDIBLE HIS SPEED
THERE'S THE WELL WAS DARLING WEAR WORRY WITH THE TAUB WAIT LIST ON THINGS HAD TO BE
COME ON LOVE COME ON SOMEONE MUST DARES RUB FIGHT FANS A RUN IN WITH TEARS
THERE'S BUTTER THERE'S SOMETHING TO SEE AND THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONS YUP THIS IS DESTINY
THIS KID'S FACE GREAT HE'S DAD'S SPEED AN ANNOYANCE BUT IF YOU SAND TO FIGHT YON END
NO ONE LIKE HIM I ABSOLUTELY NOT HIS RESULTS AT SCHOOL AS A YOUNG LAD WE WERE FAR FROM IMPRESSIVE AND YET HE WAS NEVER TOO PROUD TO SAY TO ADMIT TO THAT AND TO SAY THAT HE LEARNED FROM THE PEOPLE AND PLACES THAT HE BUMPED INTO ALONG THE WAY AND THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOUR HE LEARN FROM A WRESTLER BASED IN LAS VEGAS VERY EARLY ON IN HIS CAREER IT WAS IN HIS SEVENTH FIVE ACTUALLY IN HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREER IN HIS FLEDGLING DAYS BEFORE
ANYBODY WAS REALLY AWARE OF WHAT WAS TO COME AND HE FOUGHT IN LAS VEGAS VEGAS AND AS PART OF THE PUBLICITY TOUR AHEAD OF THAT CONTEST HE WAS ON A RADIO SHOW WITH A WRESTLER CALLED GORGEOUS GEORGE AND HE FOUND OUT THAT GORGEOUS GEORGE BEHAVED IN EXACTLY THIS MANOR AND HE SET OUT TO POLARISE THE CROWDS THAT BY THE TIME GORGEOUS GEORGE GOT TO THE RING
THAT HALF OF THE CROWD WE WANT HIM TO WIN AND THE OTHER HALF WHAT WOULD WANT TO SEE HIM DESTROYED HER BROTHER THOUGHT IF YOU WOULD MANY PEOPLE SEE THE SPORT YOU LOVE BOXING AS BRUTAL THEY SEE BOXERS THUGS AND WHAT MADE ALI EXTRAORDINARY WASN'T IT IS HE ROSE ABOVE
YES HE DID BUT OF COURSE THE AMOUNT OF PUNISHMENT THAT HE TOOK IN THE RING CLEARLY LED TO THE PROBLEMS THAT HE SUFFERED IN RETIREMENT AND I GO BACK TO WHAT I SAID ABOUT SOME OF HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS CAME WHEN HE WAS UNDER THE MOST PRESSURE AND ONE OF THE OTHER HALLMARKS OF HIS GREATNESS WAS HIS ABILITY TO RECOVER FROM SETBACKS IN THE RING HIS RECUPERATIVE POWERS WERE VIRTUALLY UNMATCHED IN THE HISTORY OF BOXING
BUT INEVITABLY THEY LEAD TO SOME OF THE HEALTH ISSUES THAT HE FACED ON RETIREMENT MIKE A STELLA THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN
MICHAEL GO HAS HIT OUT AT WHAT IS DESCRIBED AS THE INVINCIBLE ARROGANCE OF EUROPE'S ELITE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAMPAIGNERS FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IN AN INTERVIEW AN AUDIENCE QUESTION SESSION ON SKY NEWS LAST NIGHT SAID A VOTE FOR BRECHT'S IT IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM WOULD FREE BRITAIN FROM AN ELITIST ORGANISATION
IT'S THE INVINCIBLE ARROGANCE OF EUROPE'S ELITES THAT GETS ME THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE EURO COLLAPSE THESE ARE PEOPLE WERE PRESIDING OVER A MIGRATION CRISIS ON THEIR BORDERS
AND YET TO THE EVER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY NEED TO CHANGE NO THEY SAY THEY NEED MORE INTEGRATION MORE OF OUR MONEY MORE CONTROL OVER THIS COUNTRY I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE SAID TO PEOPLE WHO ARE INCAPABLE OF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THEY'VE EVER GOT ANYTHING WRONG
I'M SORRY YOU'VE HAD YOUR DAY UNELECTED UNACCOUNTABLE ELITES
I'M AFRAID IT'S TIME TO SAY YOU'RE FIRED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE BACK CONTROL THANK YOU
AND HE INSISTED ECONOMISTS HAD BEEN WRONG IN THE PAST ABOUT MAJOR ISSUES AND HE PREFERRED TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF BUSINESSMEN AN AUDIENCE MEMBER ACCUSED MY GAVE THEM THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN OF HAVING NO ECONOMIC PLAN IN THE EVENT OF BRECK'S IT
THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH DIVORCES AND THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TRY AND SORT THE MONEY OUT AFTERWARDS YOU NEGOTIATE BEFORE
AND WITHOUT HAVING A PLAN IN PLACE AND HAVING PUT THE EFFORT INTO THAT PLAN IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MISTER GAVE IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FIRST WORLD WAR GENERAL
YOU'VE GOT YOUR WAVING THE FLAG YOU'RE SAYING OVER THE TOP MEN YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S ON THE FRONT LINE OR WHAT THE CASUALTY RIGHT WILL BE IN THE CONFLICT TO COME
IT'S CERTAINLY AN ARRESTING IMAGE THE FIRST WORLD WAR IMAGE BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT I'M PUTTING MY FAITH IN IS THE INGENUITY THE CREATIVITY AND THE STRENGTH OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD REMAIN A TRYING TO FRIGHTEN
BY SAYING THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR BRITAIN TO SUCCEED THERE SAYING THAT BRITAIN IS TOO SMALL TO POOR AND WE'RE ALL TOO STUPID TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED ON THE OUTSIDE I COMPREHENSIVELY REJECT THAT EYE THING
WE WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY STRONGER CAPABLE OF FORGING TRADE DEALS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IT'S A FACT THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS THE DECLINING SHARE OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMY IT'S A FACT
THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS GROWING SLOWER THAN EVERY CONTINENT IN THE WORLD APART FROM ACT ARTICLE
IT'S A FACT THAT IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE AND WE TAKE BACK CONTROL THEN WE CAN SHAPE AN ECONOMIC POLICY WHICH IS IN OUR INTERESTS BRYN'S BEEN STRONG IN THE PAST AND BE STRONG IN THE FUTURE
MICHAEL GAVE THEIR LAST NIGHT WILL CHRIS MASON IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AND CHRIS THIS OF COURSE THE RIPOSTE TO DAVID CAMERON ON SKYE THE NIGHT BEFORE SO HOW DID IT GO MICHAEL GO WAS CLEARLY TRYING TO BE THE VOICE OF THE OPTIMISTIC OPEN MINDED ANTI ESTABLISHMENT CASE FOR OUT PRESENTING OUT AS A
PLATTER OF POLICY OPTIONS THAT MIGHT NOT BE OPEN TO THE COUNTRY AT THE MOMENT WHETHER THAT BE THEIR CLAIM THAT THEY COULD BE MORE MONEY FOR THE N.H.S. OR CUTTING V.A.T. ON ENERGY BILLS COS THAT'S SOMETHING AND IS CURRENTLY LIMITED AS A RESULT OF OUR E.U. MEMBERSHIP EVEN ADVOCATING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CONSERVATIVE STATE INTERVENTION IN INDUSTRY CITING THE PORT TALBOT STEELWORKS FOR INSTANCE AND THEN AS YOU SAY THOSE REFERENCES TO HIS OLD MATES YES HIS BOSS
PRIME MINISTER SAYING THAT HE'S OUT IN THE NIGHT BEFORE ON SKY NEWS HAD BEEN DEPRESSING AND AN EXERCISE TO SCARE YOU I THINK WHAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO DO WAS ARTICULATE A POSITIVE CASE FOR LEAVING CONTRASTING THAT WITH WHAT HE SEES AS THE NEGATIVES HAD BEEN PUT FORWARD
BY THE REMAIN CASE WHAT WE ALSO SAW THEY WAS HERE ARTICULATING THE CHASM THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE LEAVE ARGUMENTS BETWEEN VOICES LIKE HIS AND VOICES LIKE THAT OF THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL FAR AS SHE SAID EXPLICITLY I CANNOT AGREE WITH THAT WHEN IT WAS PUT TO HIM BY AN AUDIENCE MEMBER THAT NIGEL FARAGE ARTICULATED IN THE VIEW OF THE AUDIENCE MEMBER A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK ON
IMMIGRATION MICHAEL GO PRAISING WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A MULTI CULTURAL MULTI RACIAL SOCIETY WHICH HE SAID WAS A GREAT THING FOR BRITAIN AND PUSHED QUITE A LOT ON THIS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUND FIGURE WHICH IS WHAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS ARE SAYING IT'S COSTING BRITAIN YEAH PUSHED REPEATEDLY AGAIN AND AGAIN ON THAT'S A FIGURE NOT ONLY WAS MICHAEL GO SUFFICIENTLY BULLISH TO STAND BY IT AT ONE STAGE EVEN SUGGESTED A HIGHER FIGURE SUGGESTING THREE HUNDRED SIXTY BILLION BATTING AWAY THE SUGGESTION THAT THIS HAS BEEN DISMISSED BY AIR
PARLIAMENTARY SELECT COMMITTEE HAD BEEN DISMISSED BY THE U.K. STATISTICS AUTHORITY IT'S THE VIEW OF THE ALPS CAMPAIGN THAT THIS IS A FIGURE THAT IS CUTTING THROUGH THAT THIS IS A FIGURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PICKING UP ON IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS IN THE PONDERING ABOUT HOW TO VOTE AND SO THEY ARE PRESSING AHEAD WITH IT I THINK THEY SEE IT
IN A BROADER CAMPAIGN IN WHICH THEY'RE VERY PROUD OF THEIR ANTI ESTABLISHMENT CREDENTIALS AS ANOTHER WAY OF PROVING THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE ON WHAT THEY SEE AS AN ESTABLISHMENT TRYING TO KNOCK THAT FIGURE DOWN EVEN THOUGH REPEATEDLY PLENTY OF TAKE A LOOK AT THAT FIGURE AND SAID BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE MONEY THAT DOESN'T GO TO BRUSSELS BECAUSE OF THE REBATE BUT IT'S SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE CHRIS MASON THANKS VERY MUCH
THE TIME NOW IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN HUNDREDS OF NURSES AND MIDWIVES ARE EXPECTED TO DEMONSTRATE TODAY AGAINST PLANS TO SCRAP MAINTENANCE GRANTS FOR STUDENTS IN ENGLAND THE TREASURY SAYS THAT GETTING RID OF THE GRANT'S OR BURSARIES WILL ALLOW MORE NURSES TO BE TRAINED AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF NURSING DISAGREES AND WITH ME IS JANET DAVIS WHO'S THEIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
AND GENERAL SECRETARY GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT YOU THAT I ACTUALLY AM A CHANCELLOR SAYS THAT THIS WILL ALLOW AN EXTRA TEN THOUSAND NURSING PLACES TO BE CREATED WHY DO YOU DISAGREE WE STUDDED THIS QUITE CAREFULLY AND WE'VE ALSO CONSULTED OUR MEMBERS ARE MEMBERS ARE SAYING IS THAT THEY FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREED AT THIS WILL BE THE CASE
AND TWO THIRDS OF THE NURSES THAT WE HAVE SPOKEN TO AND WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE COME BACK TO US AND SAYING ACTUALLY THIS WAS IN PLACE WHEN THEY WERE TRAINING THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TRAINED AS A NURSE SO THEY'RE SAYING THEY WOULD NOT TAKE OUT A LOAN TO TRAIN OF COURSE THIS WOULD JUST BRING NURSES INTO LINE WITH ALL OTHER STUDENTS AND THERE WERE LOTS OF WARNINGS IN ADVANCE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF TUITION FEES ABOUT THE EFFECT THAT WOULD HAVE AND ACTUALLY IT DOES SEEM THAT THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE APPLYING NOW
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE APPLYING BUT THERE ARE NOT MORE MATURE PEOPLE PAT APPLYING A NURSING IS IT IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT THIS IS NOT JUST A DEGREE IN NURSING THIS IS THE COURSE THAT YOU DO TO TRAIN TO BE A NURSE SO THIS IS YOUR REGISTERED TRAINING SO WHEN YOU FINISH WITH A DEGREE YOU BECOME A REGISTERED NURSE AND FIFTY PER CENT OF THAT TIME IS SPENT LOOKING AFTER OUR
PATIENTS SO OUR FAMILIES AND OUR FRIENDS WORKING IN A HEALTH SERVICES AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR MEMBERS IS THEY CAN'T GET OTHER JOBS THEY CAN ONLY RELY ON THE THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE GETTING FOR THAT AND AT THE END OF THAT TRAINING THAT'S A HUGE STEP TO TAKE ON THOUGH IF YOU'RE OLDER IF HE'S YOUR SECOND CAREER IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOT CHILDREN IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOT MORTGAGES ET-CETERA THAT IS AN AWFUL LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM NURSES IS THAT THIS WILL
STOP PEOPLE FOR WANTING TO APPLY TO BE A NURSE PARTICULARLY THOSE PEOPLE WITH LIFE EXPERIENCE THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW MAKE FANTASTIC NURSES AND THEY'VE HAD CARING EXPENSE IT MIGHT BE THAT OLDER THEY'VE GOT A BIT OLDER THEY'VE GOT CHILDREN SO MAYBE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS WILL STILL APPLY AT THE END OF THEIR SCHOOLING TO DO A DEGREE IN NURSING THAT ACTUALLY WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS JUST ALL EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS COMING IN AND WE KNOW FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING THAT THIS WILL
A TOUGH NURSES AT A TIME WHEN WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHORTAGE OF NURSES AT THE PLAN IS TO INTRODUCE THIS IN SEPTEMBER NEST YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU'VE GOT DEMONSTRATIONS TODAY WHAT SUPPORT DO YOU HAVE FROM NURSES AND MIDWIVES AND HOW DO YOU
HOW OPTIMISTIC ARE YOU THAT YOU CAN GET HER CHANGED BEFORE NEXT WE HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR NURSES AND MIDWIVES AND ACTUALLY WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS THESE NURSES AND MIDWIVES AND STUDENT NURSES WILL NOT PERSONALLY BE AFFECTED BY THIS SO THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S AFFECTING THEM PERSONALLY BUT WHAT THEY CAN SEE IS WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO TO NURSING IN THE FUTURE IT'S GOING TO DO WITH HEALTH CARE WHEN WE'VE GOT A SHORTAGE OF NURSES ALREADY TO TAKE SUCH A HUGE RISK
MAKE THAT WE MIGHT EVEN HAVE FAIR THE SHORTAGES OF PEOPLE DON'T APPLY IS A REALLY HIGH RISK WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS STOP
PILOT ASSESS IT AND THEN INTRODUCE IT IF IT WORKS BUT WE BELIEVE IT'S VERY HIGH RISK AND THAT IT WILL NOT LEAD TO MORE NURSES IN FACT ALL THE TILL THAT'S ZHANA DAVIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

JAMES BATTERS AND THEY'RE TALKING TO REBECCA JONES TIME NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES DATED HIS TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER IN A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING DOCTOR CHECK ME KING PRIEST IN THE HINDU TRADITION OR BACK TO YOGA GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
WE OFTEN USE THE NEWS TO KEEP US UP TO DATE WITH THE FREQUENT CHANGES IN SOCIETAL BOUNDARIES WHERE THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL POLITICAL FAMILIAL THE TREND HAS GENERALLY BEEN THAT COUNTRIES ARE GETTING SMALLER AND FAMILIES ARE BECOMING MORE NUCLEAR NOTHIN THESE CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY A DESIRE FOR A SOLUTION TO OUR STRUGGLES WITH WORKING TOGETHER IN A SPIRIT OF CO OPERATION
WHAT'S PREVALENT IN SOCIETY OFTEN DEPENDS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CREATED BY A CULTURE AND THE RISK OF A CULTURE OF SELF RELIANCE IS THAT IT CAN ENCOURAGE MORE DIVISION IF IT'S NOT ROOTED IN VALUES THAT BENEFIT AND UNIFY THE MAJORITY
THE VEDIC MUDDLE OF CULTURES SUGGEST THAT WE BELONG TO THE HOLE AS PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE NATURE OUR COMMUNITIES AND PARTS OF OUR FAMILY UNITS
IT ASSUMES THAT WE ARE INTRINSICALLY RESPONSIBLE AND WILL THEREFORE COMMIT OURSELVES TO THE WELL BEING OF PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS WITH GRATITUDE FOR HOW MUCH WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR ANCESTORS AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH A COMMUNITY AND EXTENDED FAMILY NOURISH US
I DO YOU'RE BEING THAT WHEN WE FEEL CONNECTED WE NATURALLY ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRESERVING THE GIFTS WE HAVE RECEIVED FOR THOSE WHO WILL COME AFTER US
VADER'S RECOMMEND THAT A CULTURE THAT FOSTERS HARMONY IS BASED ON INCLUSIVENESS TOLERANCE AND ACCEPTANCE BUT THEY GO ON TO SAY THAT TO ESTABLISH A HEALTHY CO OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENT WE MUST ALSO DISCOVER THE DIVINE HARMONY AND ORDER INHERENT WITHIN OURSELVES SO THAT WE CAN EXPRESS IT IN THE WORLD THROUGH A RELATIONSHIP
THAT'S WHY FOR HINDUS IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO DO WHAT IN A WORK OF SELF OBSERVATION AND SELF IMPROVEMENT AND NOTICE WHAT HAS REAL LASTING VALUE AND TREASURE WHAT IS TRULY SACRED
IN TODAY'S WORLD I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT MOVER REVITALISE THE HUMAN SPIRIT AND IT IS MORE NATURAL TO US THAN WE REALISE
BUGGER GEETHA DESCRIBES HOW ALTHOUGH OUR SPIRITUAL ESSENCE IS ENCASED IN A MATERIAL BODY SPIRITUAL QUALITIES OF HUMILITY FORGIVENESS AND COMPASSION ARE INHERENT TO ALL OF US AND CAN ALWAYS BE ACCESSED
WE SIMPLY NEED AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ENCOURAGES US TO INVEST TIME AND ENERGY IN BRINGING THIS SPIRITUAL COMPETENCE TO THE SURFACE IT IS THEN FAR EASIER TO PLAY A ROLE IN ESTABLISHING A CULTURE BASED ON FORGIVENESS RESPECT AND A LOVING COMMUNITY
ONCE ESTABLISHED SUCH A CULTURE WILL KICK START A CYCLE OF POSITIVITY AND I BELIEVE THIS IS A REALISTIC AND ACHIEVABLE GOAL IF WE CAN PERSEVERE AND COMMIT TO WHAT'S REQUIRED OF US THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WE'VE GOT TO CHECK MY KANG
IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LIFE WAS A VERY DIFFICULT BEYOND IMAGINATION THAT'S WHAT A WOMAN WHO FLED FOR LOU TO YESTERDAY TOLD ME IN AN INTERVIEW THAT WILL HERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR'S TIME SHE SAYS THE CITY'S BEEN SHELLED CONSTANTLY FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS AND BECAUSE IT'S AIMED AT CIVILIAN AREAS IT HAS BEEN PETRIFYING
SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE HAVE BEEN IN CONTROL OF FALLUJAH FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS IRAQI FORCES BEGAN THEIR ASSAULT TO RETAKE THE CITY TWO WEEKS AGO BUT THE FINANCE MINISTER HAS SHE HAS SHE HAS A BARI HAS DESCRIBED IT AS A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK
JAMES JEFFREY WAS AMERICA'S AMBASSADOR AND IRAQIS NOW FELLA AT THE WASHINGTON INSTITUTE AND WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM A LITTLE EARLIER I ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY OTHER WAY TO RETAKE THE CITY WITHOUT CIVILIANS PAYING SUCH A HIGH PRICE
THIS IS NO WAY THAT IF ICES THERE'S NOT ONE TO SPARE CIVILIANS ON OF COURSE I SISTERS STRATEGY USED TO USE THEM CENTRALLY NOUS HUMANS ARE THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THIS ABOUT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES
HOW DO YOU DO IT OR HOW PRECISE YOU DO IT IT'S A QUESTION OF THE QUALITY OF THE TROOPS AND THE IRAQI GED A LARGE NUMBER OF TROOPS AND THEY'VE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT CASUALTIES FROM EXACTLY THOSE DRUGS IN THE PAST WEEK
THE WOMAN WHO ESCAPE FROM FALLUJAH THAT I SPOKE TO DESCRIBES BEING SHELLED VERY VERY HEAVILY AND BEING TOO AFRAID TO LEAVE THE HOUSE NOT HAVING WATER NOT BEING ABLE TO GET FOOD ALTHOUGH YOU SAY THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT IT IS THERE A WAY TO DO IT BETTER THAN THIS HAVING BINGE AND MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES MY STARS ARE NO THE POINT IS SHE'S ALIVE SHE'S MADE OF
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WITH NO EXPERT WITNESSES TO KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE ALMOST THINK YOU ALL WHETHER THEY WERE THE BUTTON KILLED AS THEY HAD STAYED THERE OR WHETHER THEY WERE JUST MISERABLE SITUATION SO IT'S HARD TO SAY WHETHER YOU CAN DO THIS IS THE BASIC THING WE WANT TO DO IS TO AVOID TELLING A LOT OF CIVILIANS THEY ARE MISERABLE
WITH OR WITHOUT AN INTACT ARE MISERABLE AND ISIS WHICH IS WHY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION HAS RISKED THEIR LIVES TO FLEE
IN THE PAST TWO YEARS YOU CAN DO THIS WITH FEWER CIVILIAN COUNT ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN DO IT IN A VERY GALLANT MISERABLE WAY AS WE SEE NEXT DOOR
MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN DO IT IN A MORE PRECISE MANNER I SEE IS GIVEN THE RELUCTANCE OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO PUT TROOPS ON THE FRONT LINE WE'RE GOING TO BE RELYING ON LAST QUALIFIER LESS SKILLED JOBS AND THAT MEANS MORE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES
YOU MEAN AMERICAN TROOPS SHOULD BE HERE NOW WOULD YOU HAVE THEM IN ON THE GROUND NOW RE FIGHTING THE BATTLE FOR FALLUJAH I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE SOME ABSOLUTELY I WOULD CERTAINLY POINT FORWARD OBSERVER TEAMS
CERTAIN ENGINEER UNITS AND SOME ARE RAIDING FORCES OUT THERE IN FRONT OF THE VOICE THAT'S HOW WE GET IT OR DO WE HAVE PEOPLE INSIDE THE CITY MINDING THE AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE CONCENTRATIONS OF INSURGENTS AND MARKING AREAS WHERE SHE'S WRONG AND OF COURSE IN THAT FIGHT THERE WERE MANY LOSSES ROGER CIVILIANS BUT ALSO OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS I THINK IT WAS UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND WITH OF COURSE MANY HUNDREDS MORE INJURED
IT WAS A VERY BLOODY AND THESE WERE FOR US WHERE OUR SOLDIERS WAS I'M NOT YOUR SUPPORT ANOTHER TECHNICAL MEANS LOOKING ARACHNIDS DOWN HOW DO YOU U.S. I SUPPORT THEY WERE JUST WOULDN'T BE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THAT SO WE ARE WHERE WE ARE IS THIS CIVILIAN LOSS OF LIFE JUST WHAT YOU SEE IS THE PRICE THAT NEEDS TO BE PAID IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO HAVE CONTROL OF FALLUJAH IS SO IMPORTANT TO DESTROY A USELESS AS THE STAIN IN A MILITARY FORCE
THE SITUATION OF CIVILIANS I KNOW THEY'RE CONTROLLING SO DIRE THAT I WOULD NOT CALL AFTERSUN PERMANENTLY SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'RE WELL AND VAULTS OF CASUALTIES THAT SAID I WOULD DO THIS SLOWLY AND AS PRECISELY AS PARTIAL
TO TRY TO AVOID NOUS BOMBARDMENT OF CIVILIANS JAMES GEOFFREY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FALLUJAH IS JUST THIRTY MILES FROM THE IRAQI CAPITAL BAGHDAD AND WE'RE JOINED FROM THERE BY OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT JIM MUIR AND JIM BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT IS GOING INCREDIBLY SLOWLY BUT ARE THE IRAQI FORCES WINNING
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY I MEAN IT WHEN YOU SEE THE AMOUNT OF TROOPS OR FORCES ON THE GROUND A LOT OF THEM RATHER MOTLEY ARRAY OF SHIA MILITIAS YOU YOU THINK IT'S INEVITABLE THEY MUST TAKE FOR TO BUT IT IS A VERY IT'S LIKE A DOG ATTACKING A PORCUPINE IT'S IT'S VERY VERY TOUGH BATTLE I S. FIGHTERS WHO KNOW THE TRAIN EXTREMELY WELL I'VE HAD MORE THAN TWO YEARS TO PREPARE FOR THIS THEY KNEW IT WAS GOING TO COME EVENTUALLY SOONER OR LATER
SO THEY'VE GOT REINFORCED OFFENCES THEY'VE GOT SUICIDE BOMBERS THEY'VE GOT SNIPERS EVERYWHERE IT'S REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT YOU NEED CRACK TROOPS TO GO IN THERE AND IRAQI FORCES PROBLEM IS THEY HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF CRACK TH TROOPS THE THE THE MOST RELIABLE UNIT COMBAT UNITS CALLED THE COUNTER TERRORISM FORCE THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT ONLY HAS
PERHAPS A FEW THOUSAND REALLY TRAINED QUALIFIED COMBAT TROOPS NOW THEY ARE PRESSING IN ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF FALLUJAH BUT ROUND THE WEST ON THE NORTH AND THE EAST IT'S MORE ACTUALLY HAVE A SHIA MILITIAS WHO ARE MAKING THE RUNNING THE MIXED UP WITH SOME OF THE OFFICIAL IRAQI ARMY FORCES WITH SO CALLED FEDERAL POLICE UNITS AND SO ON AND INDEED SOME SUNNI TRIBAL UNITS AS WELL OR FORCES BUT THESE ARE NOT HARDENED COMBAT OF SPEARHEAD TROOPS THERE THEY ARE
MAKING SLOW PROGRESS SO THE BATTLE FOR FALLUJAH HAS NOT YET ACTUALLY STARTED THEY HAVEN'T MOVED IN TO THE HAVEN'T TRIED TO START MOVING AND TO THE BUILT UP AREAS OF THE CITY THEY'RE STILL MOVING IN AROUND THE EDGE TO KIND OF PUT A RING OF STEEL THE BLOCKADE AROUND IT BEFORE LAUNCHING A FINAL ASSAULT ON THE CITY AND THAT'S WHEN THE BATTLE WILL REALLY START WELL AS I SAID AT WILL HERE WITHIN THE HOUR FROM A WOMAN WHO MANAGED TO ESCAPE YESTERDAY WITH HER FAMILY ARE THERE MANY CIVILIANS MAKING IN HER DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED
WELL FROM THAT THE HOSPITAL INSIDE FOR LUCIA THAT IT'S BEEN FLOODED WITH DOZENS OF WOUNDED CIVILIANS ON THAT SOME HAVE BEEN KILLED BY INTENSIVE SHELLING OF THE WHOLE CITY THAT'S BEEN GOING ON WE'VE SEEN IT GOING OUT FROM MILITARY BASES NEARBY HEAVY ARTILLERY BEING PUMPED IN NOW IT'S PRESUMABLY TARGETED BUT OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU'VE GOT FIGHTERS MIXED UP WITH CIVILIANS CIVILIANS WILL GO
HURT SO CONDITIONS ARE A HORRIBLE SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE HUNDRED WERE REPORTED JUST A DAY TO HAVE ESCAPED FROM NOT FROM FALLUJAH ITSELF BECAUSE AS I SAY THAT THAT IS YET TO BE RINGED PLACE AWAY HERE WHICH IS AWAY TO THE NORTH WEST SEVERAL QUITE A FEW MILES ACTUALLY
CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN FLEEING FROM THEIR THERE'VE BEEN CROSSING THE RIVER BY EITHER SWIMMING OR GETTING IN BOATS AND THERE BUT OF COURSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE PROCESSED BY THE SECURITY FORCES SO THE SCOPE FOR A PROCESS WHERE IN FACT QUITE OFTEN MEN ARE WEEDED OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE VETTED IN CASE THERE ARE YES FIGHTERS TRYING TO ESCAPE OR SUICIDE BOMBERS OR WHATEVER AND THERE HAS BEEN A SUICIDE BOMBER BLOWING HIMSELF UP AMONG CIVILIANS WHO HAD ESCAPED
SO DID REALLY AS A REAL DANGER SO EVEN IF THEY DO MANAGE TO BRAVE THE ORDEAL WITH THE GAUNTLET OF GETTING OUT THERE OR THE TROUBLES ARE BY NO MEANS OVER IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A COMFORTABLE LIFE FOR THEM FOR A VERY LONG TIME JIM THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT JAY WYNNE HAS THE WEATHER FOR CAST FOREST MORNING JOE

ALI FAMOUSLY TAUNTED HIS OPPONENT GEORGE FOREMAN BEFORE THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE BETRAYING THE MORE POWERFUL FIGHTER AS A LUMBERING OAF BUT THIS MORNING FOREMAN TOLD THE B. B. C. HE HAD NOTHING BUT LOVE AND RESPECT FOR ALI

AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS EXTRA A WEEK BY TWENTY TWENTY THE FIGURE WAS RELEASED AFTER THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO WHO'VE APPEARED ON THE SECOND MAJOR T. V. EVENT OF THE CAMPAIGN ON SKY NEWS ARGUING THE CASE FOR BRECHT'S
THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS DESCRIBED THE N.H.S. SPENDING CLAIM AS TOTALLY DISHONEST A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN REPORTS
MICHAEL GO VOICE REPEATEDLY CHALLENGED TO NAME A MAJOR ECONOMIC INSTITUTION THAT HAD BACKED BRECK'S IT HIS RESPONSE SET THE TONE FOR MUCH OF HIS SUBSEQUENT ARGUMENT HE WAS GLAD THAT MAJOR ORGANISATIONS DID NOT SUPPORT LEAVING THE E.U. HE SAID BECAUSE THESE WERE THE ELITES PEOPLE WITH AN AGENDA WHO'D BEEN CONSISTENTLY WRONG IN THE PAST AN AUDIENCE MEMBER SUGGESTED MY GAVE HADN'T SET OUT A DETAILED ECONOMIC PLAN
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FIRST WORLD WAR GENERAL YOU'RE SAYING OVER THE TOP MAN BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S ON THE FRONT LINE OR WHAT THE CASUALTY RIGHT WILL BE IN THE CONFLICT SUCCUMB BUT MISTER GO SAID HE HAD FAITH IN THE INGENUITY OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE
IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE AND WE TAKE BACK CONTROL THEN WE CAN SHAPE AN ECONOMIC POLICY WHICH IS IN OUR INTERESTS BRYN'S BEEN STRONG IN THE PAST AND BE STRONG IN THE FUTURE
AFTER THE PROGRAMME VOTE LEAVE SAID THAT E.U. WITHDRAWAL WOULD ALLOW AN EXTRA ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A WEEK TO BE SPENT ON THE N.H.S. BY TWENTY TWENTY THE REMAIN SIDE CALLED THE CLAIM TOTALLY DISHONEST SAYING THEIR OPPONENTS WERE WRITING CHEQUES THEY KNEW WOULD BOUNCE
ALL SIX LIVING FORMER LABOUR LEADERS HAVE JOINED FORCES TO PERSUADE THE PARTY SUPPORTERS TO BACK STAYING IN THE E.U. IN HER SPEECH LATER TODAY ONE OF THEM GORDON BROWN WILL SAY MEMBERSHIP OFFERS GREATER SECURITY AGAINST TERRORISM AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MORE DETAILS FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT MARK DARCY
THERE'S RISING CONCERN AMONGST LABOUR REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS THAT THE PARTY'S FAILED TO PERSUADE IT'S TRADITIONAL BASE OF THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. AND TODAY THAT SIX EX LEADERS NEIL KINNOCK MARGARET BECKETT TONY BLAIR GORDON BROWN HARRIET HARMAN AND ED MILIBAND HAVE ISSUED A JOINT STATEMENT INSISTING THAT THE E. U. STANDS FOR LABOUR VALUES ARE WARNING THAT IF LABOUR VOTERS STAY AT HOME
BRITAIN LEAVES THEY SAY THE E. USE DELIVERED MORE JOBS PROTECTIONS AT WORK AND LOWER PRICES AND THEY WARM THAT IF BRITAIN'S VOTES TO LEAVE LABOUR COMMUNITIES WOULD BE HIT BY SPENDING CUTS AND WHAT THEY CALL A BONFIRE OF WORKERS' RIGHTS
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ARMY LAW DERMOTT HAS CALLED FOR A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO THE DEATHS OF FOUR YOUNG ARMY RECRUITS AT THE DEEPCUT BARRACKS AND SERRIED TWO DECADES AGO YESTERDAY A CORONER FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD PRIVATE CHERYL JAMES HAD BEEN UNLAWFULLY KILLED AT THEIR BASE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE BUT HE CONCLUDED THE ARMY HAD FAILED IN ITS DUTY OF CARE TO YOUNG RECRUITS AT THE BASE LAW DOWN AT THE ARMY HAD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH THE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND BULLYING
YES THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC INQUIRY I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY PRACTICAL REASONABLE RESPONSE TO THIS BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW BUT I WOULD STRESS AGAIN THAT IF THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO WENT THROUGH TRAINING A DEEP CUT OR INDEED ELSEWHERE AND BELIEVE THAT THEY SUFFERED
BULLYING OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT THERE'S NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED THEY SHOULD COMPLAIN IF THEY'RE STILL SERVING TO THE SERVING PLEASED TO SERVICE POLICE OR TO THE CIVILIAN POLICE
A STUDY IN THE UNITED STATES SAYS TARGETING CANCER DRUGS TO SPECIFIC WEAKNESSES IN THE PATIENT'S TUMOUR COULD BE UP TO SIX TIMES AS AFFECTIVE AS TRADITIONAL METHODS A TEAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOOKED AT THE TREATMENT OF THIRTEEN THOUSAND PATIENTS JAMES GALLAGHER REPORTS FROM THE WORLD'S BIGGEST COUNTER CONFERENCE IN CHICAGO
PRECISION MEDICINE IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING FIELDS IN CANCER RESEARCH THE IDEAS TO TAKE THE D.N.A. OF EVERY PATIENT'S TUMOUR HUNT FOR ITS SPECIFIC WEAK SPOTS AND THEN TARGET THERAPIES TO KILL THE CANCER DATA ON HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS PRESENTED AT THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY SHOW THIRTY ONE PER CENT OF TUMOUR SHRANK WHEN A PRECISION APPROACH WAS USED
COMPARED WITH JUST SIX PERCENT OF THE TIME WHEN THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO MATCH DRUG IN TUMOUR SOME PATIENTS ARE ALREADY BENEFITING FROM PRECISION DRUGS LIKE HERCEPTIN IN BREAST CANCER BUT CANCER RESEARCH U.K. SAYS A REVOLUTION IN ANALYSING D.N.A. IS LEADING TO A NEW ERA FOR ALL CANCERS

MARGARET BECKETT HARRIET HARMAN AND NEIL KINNOCK WHO JOINS US IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU LORD GOOD MORNING THIS SOUNDS LIKE A RIP LETTER WRITTEN IN FEAR DO YOU FEAR THAT LABOUR SUPPORTERS SIMPLY DON'T SEE THIS IS YOUR FIGHT
NO THAT ISN'T THE REASON FOR THE LETTER THE LETTER WHICH COMES JUST ABOUT THREE WEEKS WE WROTE IT TUESDAY I THINK BEFORE THE REFERENDUM IS CERTAINLY A WAY OF EMPHASISING THE ABSOLUTE NEED FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY VOTED LABOUR CHEERLEADERS VALUES TO ENSURE THAT THEY USE THEIR VOTE AND TODAY WILL BE CAMPAIGNING MYSELF AND SEVERAL OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT LIST
WILL BE CAMPAIGNING TO PUT A VERY STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE NEED FOR YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY TO REGISTER TO GET A POSTAL VOTE TO ENSURE THAT THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE REFERENDUM ARE YOU STRUCK WHEN HE LISTEN TO MICHAEL GAVE ON THE TELEVISION YOU STAY THE FIRST BIG T. V. EVENTS FOR THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN
HIS MESSAGE IS DIRECTED AT YOUR TRADITIONAL VOTERS LEAVE YOU GET MORE ON THE N.H.S. USES LEAVE YOU CAN GIVE MONEY TO THE STEEL AND YOU LEAVE AND YOU CAN CUT V.A.T. IF HE'S TRYING TO DO THAT HE WON'T BE BELIEVED BECAUSE NONE OF HIS SONS AND UP AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO GO THROUGH THOSE SOUNDS THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUND A WEEK FIGURE THAT HE USED REPEATEDLY AND THEY CONTINUED USE WITH DESCRIBED BY ANDREW TIORAIDH
THE SECRETARY SORRY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE A COMMONS SELECT COMMITTEE AS BOGUS THE NATIONAL STATISTICAL OFFICE CALLED IT HIGHLY MISLEADING AND THE IDEA THAT WE COULD SAVE A GIGANTIC SUM OF MONEY BY NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE EUROPEAN UNION LOSING OUR AXES TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND OUR POWERS TO MAKE RULES DOING ALL THAT
AND SOMEHOW MAINTAIN AS THEY'VE PROMISED ALL THE EXPENDITURE ON AGRICULTURE ON THE REGIONS ON NORTHERN ISLAND ON SCIENCE ONCE NOT ON SOCIAL PROJECTS AND SMALL BUSINESS ALL THE REST OF IT AND ON TOP OF IT THROW AWAY ONE POINT SIX BILLION BY CUTTING V.A.T. OFF ENERGY BILLS AND SHOVEL MONEY AT THE N.H.S. SIMPLY
TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE AND IT FORTY YEARS AGO THE YOUNG NEIL KINNOCK WOULD HAVE SOUNDED RATHER LIKE THE RATHER OLDER MICHAEL GAVE YOU A COCOA SLIPS AND I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S OBVIOUSLY I'M SURE EVERYTHING DIED A VET YOU OPPOSED BRITAIN STAYING IN WHAT WAS THEN THE COMMON MARKET NOW THE ARGUMENT ON THE LEFT WAS A CLEAR WHAT WASN'T IT
THE COMMON MARKET THEN THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW SURELY IN TRENCHES THE FREE MARKET GIVES POWER TO GLOBAL CORPORATIONS AGAINST THE LITTLE GUY THAT WAS THAT WAS TRUE THEN IT'S TRUE IT WAS MY PARTICULAR FUNDAMENTAL REASON FOR CAMPAIGNING TO COME OUT OF THE COMMON MARKET IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE REFERENDUM IT WAS BECAUSE
I WAS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED AS WELSH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT THAT THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE OF NORTHERN EUROPE WOULD SUCK IN INVESTMENT IN JOBS FROM UNITED KINGDOM BECAUSE IT WAS NEAR TO THE EDGE AND PARTICULARLY WALES'S PERIPHERALLY AREA AND WHAT I DIDN'T REALISE NO REASON I SHOULD HAVE REALISED IT WAS AT THE VERY SAME TIME
THE EUROPEAN COMMON MARKET THE COMMUNITY AS IT THEN WAS WAS ESTABLISHING ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY TO COUNTERACT PRECISELY WHAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT BUT I DON'T IT WILL BE WHEN THE FACTS CHANGED I CHANGED MY MIND BUT IT IS THE GLOBAL CORPORATIONS THEY GET POWER IN THE BIG WASN'T IT AND WHY NOT LABOUR VOTERS ARE OFTEN SAYING TO YOU WE'RE NOT BEING PROTECTED FROM MASS IMMIGRATION OF GLOBAL THEY'VE BEEN DRAPED IN THE WAY WE WERE BUT THE GLOBAL CORPORATIONS ARE CALLED GLOBAL CORPORATIONS BECAUSE THEY
AND THEY WILL OPERATE IN ANY CASE NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THE EUROPEAN UNION DO ABOUT IT IT'S GOT COMPETITION RULES THE CHALLENGES THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD AND IT HAS A STRONG SOCIAL DIMENSION OF THE SINGLE MARKET
WHICH ARE SIT WHICH IS SAFEGUARDING WORKERS EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS NOW THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO OPERATE PRAGMATICALLY IN THE WORLD AS IT REALLY IS A LAST ONE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY COURSE YOU SAY THIS THEY SAY HE'S GOT A BIG FAT EUROPEAN CAMP A COMMISSION PENSION IT'S A WIFE'S GOT A PENSION COS SHE USED TO WORK HIS SONIA'S NORTH BRAZIL ACROSS ALTHOUGH POINTED SHE WAS ELECTED UP BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT THE EURO ESTAMOS AND ANYBODY IN THERE WAS ME
KNOWS THAT I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN MY ROOTS OR MY REASON FOR HIM BEING ENGAGED AS A LABOUR PARTY MEMBER IN PROGRESSIVE POLITICS THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE AS FOR THE PENSION AND SO ON IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'S PAID TO OTHER PEOPLE CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR WHO'VE BEEN COMMISSIONERS BUT IT'S ONLY MINE GET NAME GOES UP IN THE END LIGHTS I'M NOT GOING TO GET WORRIED ABOUT THAT

TEAM REPORTS THAT JARGON AND GENDER CLICHES IN THE FINANCE INDUSTRY ARE TURNING OFF FEMALE INVESTORS THE PAPER SAYS THAT WOMEN FEEL ALIENATED BY CAMPAIGNS DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO WEALTHY OLDER MEN
SAYS THIS IS ONE REASON WHY WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO THEIR SAVINGS IN CASH THE F. T. GOES ON TO SAY THAT SENIOR WOMEN IN THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY BUT LEAVE A SUBSTANTIAL MARKETING MAKEOVER IS NEEDED TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE
A NUMBER OF PAPERS CARRY A WARNING ABOUT THE DANGERS OF CHILDREN EATING LAUNDRY CAPSULES BECAUSE THEY THINK THE BRIGHTLY COLOURED GELS OR SWEETS AT LEAST ONE CHILD EVERY DAY HE'S SWALLOWING THE TOXIC CAPSULES ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH THE EXPRESS SAYS VICTIMS RISK FALLING INTO A COMA AND THEY CAN ALSO SUFFER TEMPORARY BLINDNESS IF THEY GET THE LIQUID FROM THEIR CAPS AND INTO THEIR EYES
THE MALE REPORTS IN THE CASE OF A SEVENTEEN MONTH OR GOLD HE SPENT A WEEK IN INTENSIVE CARE AFTER SHE BIT INTO A CAPSULE FOR A SECOND AND SWALLOWED HALF THE LIQUID INSIDE DOCTORS IT WAS ONLY DUE TO THE QUICK REACTION OF A MOTHER THAT LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE WAS SAVED TIME NOW IT'S TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE BRITISH ARMY LAW DANITE HAS SAID THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO WHAT HAPPENED AT DEEPCUT BARRACKS IN THE LATE NINETIES ON NEWSNIGHT LAST NIGHT HE SUPPORTED A CALL MADE BY THE FAMILY OF PRIVATE CHERYL JAMES A SECOND INQUEST INTO HER DEATH CONCLUDED YESTERDAY THAT SHE HAD KILLED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS ON GUARD DUTY THERE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE CORONER ALSO SAID THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE SHE HAD BEEN RAPED THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT THE INQUEST DID PAINT A PICTURE OF A DEEPLY UNHAPPY PLACE AND THE ARM IS HEAD OF PERSONNEL ADMITTED
DURING THE INQUEST THAT THERE WAS A HIGHLY SEXUALISED ATMOSPHERE AT THE TIME AND ABUSE AND MISUSE OF POWER FOR SOLDIERS WERE FOUND SHOT DEAD THERE OVER SEVEN YEAR PERIOD SHALL JAMES'S FATHER DES JAMES SAID THIS AFTER THE VERDICT YESTERDAY
THE EVIDENCE HAS REVEALED SERIOUS AND PROFOUND FAILURES IN THE CARE AND SUPERVISION THAT OUGHTA HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO HER
AND TO ALL OF THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE WHO JOINED UP FOR THE BRITISH ARMY
DEEP KURT WAS A TOXIC AND HORRIBLE ENVIRONMENT FOR A YOUNG WOMAN AND WE HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THIS WOULD HAVE HAD A TERRIBLE IMPACT ON THOSE THAT WOULD REQUIRED TO LIVE THERE
JAMES WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE CURRENT HEAD OF THE ARMY THE CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF GENERAL SIR NICK CARTER GOOD MORNING TO YOU YES GOOD MORNING SIR IT'S YOUR PREDECESSOR LORD DONE IT RIGHT THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO WHAT HAPPENED DEEP CUT BEFORE I ANSWER THAT QUESTION I JUST LIKE TO SAY AS A STARTING POINT THAT AS THE CURRENT HEAD OF THE ARMY AND IT'S HER FATHER I DEEPLY REGRET CHERYL'S TRAGIC DEATH AND I WANT TO APOLOGISE UNRESERVEDLY TO MISTER AND MISSUS JAMES
FOR THE FAILINGS AT DEEPCUT BARRACKS IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION ABOUT PUBLIC INQUIRY THERE IS I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY WE NEED TO GET TO THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WHATEVER IS THE BEST METHOD OF DOING THAT SHOULD BE PURSUIT COS WE ALL NEED TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF WHAT TOOK PLACE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND THAT MAYBE YOU EXCEPT VIRA PUBLIC INQUIRY IF THAT'S THE BEST METHOD OF GETTING TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER THEN I GUESS THAT SHOULD BE THE WAY THAT WE GO
YOU TALK ABOUT THE FAILINGS AT DEEP CUT DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THE FAILINGS THERE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO HER DEATH
I THINK MY STARTING POINT WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE LEARNT A HUGE AMOUNT FROM WHAT TOOK PLACE THE CUT WE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE WAY THAT WE TRAIN YOUNG PEOPLE WE'VE INVESTED AN AWFUL LOT IN WELL FOR SUPPORT FOR THOSE IN TRAINING AND THEIR FAMILIES PASTORAL CARE IS RIGHT AT THE HEART OF INDEED AND I WANT TO GET ON TO WHAT THE SITUATION NOW BUT JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE THEN BECAUSE OF COURSE SHE WASN'T ALONE THERE WERE FOUR SOLDIERS WHO WERE FOUND SHOT DEAD AND THERE IS THERE
LIKELIHOOD OF FURTHER INQUEST INTO THEIR DEATHS THE FAMILIES HAVE SAID THEY WANT TO PUSH IT DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THE WHAT WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT DEEPCUT AT THE TIME MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THOSE DEBTS WE ANSWERS WE'VE LEARNT A LOT OF LESSONS FROM IT AND I THINK THE IMPLICATION OF THAT IS THAT THINGS WERE NOT RIGHT AT THE TIME
AND IN TERMS OF THOSE LESSONS SO I TAKE YOUR POINT BUT I WONDER IF THAT LEADS TO I SUPPOSE THAT LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WHAT WAS GOING ON AT DEEPCUT MUST HAVE CONTRIBUTED I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHY THINGS HAVE HAD TO CHANGE AND I WAS GETTING ON TO EXPLAINING TO YOU WHAT HAS CHANGED I THINK IN THE FIRST POINT IS THAT WE RECOGNISE THAT THE PASTORAL CARE WAS AN ADEQUATE THERE WE RECOGNISE THAT WE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH INSTRUCTORS IN RATIO TO THOSE IN TRAINING
WE DIDN'T HAVE A PHILOSOPHY THAT WE NOW DO ABOUT TRAINING IN RATHER THAN SELECTING OUT AND HE DID WE DIDN'T HAVE PROPER TRANSPARENCY WE NOW HAVE REGULAR OFSTED INSPECTIONS AND THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH OUR INSTITUTIONS A LOT RECENTLY AND THE ARTS IS THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN GRADED OUTSTANDING OR GOOD SO I THINK WE ARE LEARNING THOSE LESSONS
YOU SAY LEARNING THE LESSONS I SUPPOSE ONE CAN NEVER BE ENTIRELY COMPLACENT OR SURE THAT THERE AREN'T STILL PROBLEMS BUT
HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T THE FORMS OF BULLYING AND ABUSE OF POWER IN ON BASES NOW THAT WERE EXISTING
WELL I'M NOT I'M ON THE RECORD AS MAKING A PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO GETTING AFTER UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR INDEED I HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE APPROACH TO IT AND IT REQUIRES LEADERSHIP AT EVERY LEVEL TO BE COMMITTED TO THIS AND DID IN PURSUIT OF THIS I LAUNCHED A NEW CO LEADERSHIP IN SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR WHERE WE GOT ALL OF THE COMMANDING OFFICERS IN THE BRITISH ARMY TOGETHER WITH THEIR REGIMENTAL START MAJOR OVER FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE
AND WE ASKED THEM TO LOOK THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR AS LEADERS AND WE ASKED THEM A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND FUNDAMENTALLY THE QUESTION YOU NEED TO US
IS TOO THEY LIVE BY THE VALUES AND STANDARDS THAT WE ARE SPAS AND DO THEY CARE FOR THOSE THEY LEAD AND THAT DOES REQUIRE PEOPLE TO KNOW THEY'RE SOLDIERS IT REQUIRES THEM TO RESPECT EACH OTHER
AND THEN IT REQUIRES THEM FUNDAMENTALLY TO CARE FOR THEIR PEOPLE AND THAT'S THE THING THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP MAJORING ON OBVIOUSLY CULTURE AND YOU MADE A BIG THING A BIT OF CHANGING THE CULTURE AND IT'S HUGELY IMPORTANT THERE IS ALSO THERE WAS SOME SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WOULD BE REQUIRED AS ANYONE BEEN HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CULTURE OF THE TIME OF DEEP CUT AT THE D. CUP BANKS PROBLEMS
WE HAVE AND WE HAVE AN APPROACH NOW HAVE ABSOLUTELY USING A STICK AND A CARROT AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK FOR WHAT TOOK PLACE THEN BUT NOWADAYS I'M IN NO DOUBT THAT IF PEOPLE STEP OUT OF LINE AND THEY FAIL AS LEADERS THEN THEY WILL BE DISCIPLINED OR INDEED HAVE SOME FORM OF ACTION TAKEN AGAINST THEM BUT DO YOU KNOW IF IF THERE WAS ANYONE WHO WAS HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE LATE NINETIES AND EARLY TWO THOUSAND
CERTAIN PEOPLE HAD ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION TAKEN AGAINST HIM AS I UNDERSTAND IT BUT IN A SENSE WHAT I WANT IS TO FOCUS ON TODAY AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO MAKE THINGS BETTER THIS TIME ROUND BECAUSE IT'S SITUATION WE FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE IN PEOPLE GETTING A CHANCE TO MAXIMISE THEIR POTENTIAL IT'S ALL ABOUT MAXIMISING THEIR TALENT
DOES HE PLAY NOW WE HAVE SOME TEN THOUSAND APPRENTICESHIPS ANNUALLY WEATHER GREATER SUPPLY FOR PRINCE SHIPS IN THE COUNTRY WE OFFER UP TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT TRADES WE GENUINELY EDUCATE PEOPLE ON AROUND SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR JUNIOR SOLDIERS ARRIVE WITH VERY LOW LITERACY AND NUMERACY AREN'T THEY
GET PROPERLY EDUCATED AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PLOIDH S. BUT I MEAN THE REASON I'M PUSHING AND YOU'LL NO THIS IS THAT WE HAVE A VERY PUBLIC STORY THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE WILL READ ABOUT AND THEY WILL KNOW THAT FOR YOUNG SOLDIERS DIED THEY WILL KNOW THAT THERE WAS THIS CULTURE OF ABUSE AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THEY PERHAPS MIGHT WONDER WHO WAS HELD RESPONSIBLE
THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THE OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE MADE ON B. B. C. TWO LAST NIGHT BY LAW DOWN ARE APPROPRIATE WE WANT TRANSPARENCY AND WE WANT TO GET TO THE HEART OF WHAT OCCURRED
GENERAL SIR NICK CARTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME AFRICA BE THE TIME NOW IS ABOUT SIX MINUTES TO NINE VOTE LEAD TO GET MORE CASH TO THE N.H.S. MORE TO THE STEEL INDUSTRY MORE TO CUT V.A.T. FOR WORKING PEOPLE THAT WAS THE MESSAGE OF THE JUSTICE SECRETARY AND PROMINENT LEAVE SUPPORTER MICHAEL GOES WHEN HE FOLLOWED DAVID CAMERON INTO THE T.V. STUDIO FOR THE FIRST OF A SERIES A BIG TELEVISION SPECIALS HIS CABINET COLLEAGUE JOHN WHITTINGDON JOINS US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MY
GOOD MORNING YOU'RE A FORMER CLOSE ADVISOR TO MARGARET THATCHER CAN YOU PIN DOWN THE DATE AT WHICH YOU WERE CONVERTED TO THE IDEA OF SPENDING LOTS MORE PUBLIC MONEY ON THE N.H.S. MUCH MORE MONEY ON FAILING INDUSTRIES AND CUTTING V.A.T. FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT IF WE WERE TO BE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION THEN WE WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THOSE KINDS OF DECISIONS YOU'VE NEVER GOING TO GET IN IT NOT NOW I'VE GOT IN THE PAST OF COURSE I BELIEVE IN SPENDING PUBLIC MONEY ON THE N.H.S.
OH USED TO LEAVE BEEN GIVING MORE MONEY TO THE HEALTH SERVICE MORE TO THE STEEL INDUSTRY IN CUTTING V.A.T. WHILE YOU'VE GOT I BELIEVE IN I'VE FOUGHT ELECTIONS FOR THE LAST SIX ELECTIONS ON MANIFESTOS TO INCREASE SPENDING ON THE HEALTH SERVICE AND THAT WAS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON THE HEALTH SERVICE BUT THE POINT IS THAT AT THE MOMENT WE ARE PAYING OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK TO THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WILL GET BACK CONTROL OF THAT MONEY IF WE I THINK YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW IS DESCRIBED AS MISLEADING BY THE U.K. STATISTICS
I THINK LOOK RATHER THAN WALKING ABOUT THE PRECISE FIGURE THAT IS THAT WE COULD JUST NOT ON WHICH WE HAVE WE THAT'S THE FIGURE WE PAY OVER YES WE GET SOUND THAT BACK BUT WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF HOW TO SPEND AND WHAT NOBODY WILL DENY IS THAT THERE IS APPROXIMATELY TEN BILLION POUND NET CONTRIBUTION WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD NOT BE MAKING IF WE WERE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE FREE TO SPEND AS YOU'RE CLEAR POINT IS THAT YOU WE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE IN THAT'S CLEARLY TRUE A SERIES OF AIR IS IF WE LEFT THE N.H.S. CAN WE CLARIFY THOUGH IF YOUR GOVERNMENT
IF ANY GOVERNMENT WANTED TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON THE N.H.S. INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED MILLION FIGURE IT COULD CHOOSE TO DO SO AND IT COULD DO SO RELATIVELY EASILY AND IS NOT A VAST SUM OF MONEY FOR ANY GOVERNMENT TO FIGHT
THE GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING A LOT MORE MONEY ON THE N.H.S. BUT NEVERTHELESS WE STILL HAVE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WE STILL HAVE A DEFICIT BUT HE'S TOO HIGH YOU'RE IMPLYING UPSURGE SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU'RE IMPLYING WE HAVE TO LEAVE THE E.U. TO DO IT AND I'M PUTTING WE DO THAT IT'S NOT TRUE OBVIOUSLY GOVERNMENT COULD CHOOSE TO SPEND MORE MONEY IN ANY AREA IF IT WILL TO EITHER PUT UP TAXES OR TO INCREASE BORING BUT NEITHER OF THOSE THREE THINGS ARE THINGS WHICH I WOULD SUPPORT THE BENEFIT OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS THE CURRENT TEN BILLION
PAYMENT NET CONTRIBUTION WHICH WE MAKE EVERY YEAR WE WOULD NO LONGER BE MAKING IN THAT MONEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO SPEND IN WHATEVER AREAS WE DECIDED WERE PRIORITIES FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE NOT FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK THE UNDERLYING POINT IS THIS THAT THE ONLY ECONOMISTS YOU ABLE TO QUOTE IN YOUR FAVOUR ARE LED BY PATRICK MINFORD WHO LIKE YOU ADVISE MARGARET THATCHER
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HE'S IN FAVOUR OF SLASHING REGULATIONS HE'S IN FAVOUR OF CUTTING TAXES AND IT PUT IT TO YOU THAT YOU'RE MASQUERADING AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BRING ABOUT A MORE LEFT WING BRITAIN WITH MORE PUBLIC SPENDING
IT'S NOT A QUESTION ABOUT A MORE LEFT WING ON MORE RIGHT WING BRITAIN IT WAS A QUESTION ABOUT REGAINING CONTROL TAKING BACK CONTROL OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CAN DECIDE FOR IT FOR ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE WHERE OUR PRIORITIES LIE WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CUT TAXES FOR INSTANCE WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ZERO RATE V.A.T. ON FUEL WHICH WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO ONCE WE'RE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD SPEND THAT MONEY BETTER THAN THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOES IT IS ABOUT TAKING BACK CONTROL
CHRIS CHRIS OF COURSE IS WHETHER YOU'D ACTUALLY DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS THAT IT SEEMS TO ME YOU SAY WE'LL USE THAT THEORETICALLY GOOD IT JUST SO HAPPENS I'VE BEEN IN GOVERNMENT FOR YEARS NOT THEM
AS OR SOMETHING COME AND HE'S DOING A LOT OF THOSE THINGS WE HAVE CUT TAXES WE HAVE WE ARE SPENDING MORE ON THE N.H.S. O.K. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON TEN BILLION POUNDS EVERY YEAR WHITBY ON WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL SORRY IT WAS SO BRIEF JOHN WITTINGLY BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENT
IT'S NOW COMING UP TO ONE MINUTE TO NINE AND THAT IS PRETTY MUCH IT FROM ARSE OUR EDITORS TODAY WERE JOHN MOORES AND DAVE MCMAHON AND LET'S GIVE THE FINAL WORD TO THE MAN WHO WE SPENT MUCH OF THE PROGRAMME TALKING ABOUT IF YOU FOUND OUT WHAT MUST LOVE YOU WON'T LIKE IT GEORGE FOREMAN HE TALKS TOO MUCH HE'S UGLY HE'S FOR TAMBA I'M THERE TO TRY AND MAKE ME THE UNDERDOG I WAS SURE WHILE BECAUSE OF THE CHAIR ON THE REAL CHAMPION
