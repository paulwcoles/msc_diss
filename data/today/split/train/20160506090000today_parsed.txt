GOOD MORNING IT'S SIX O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE SIXTH MAVIS IS TODAY WERE JUSTIN WEBB AND NICK ROBINSON THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE S.N.P. SAYS IT'S WON HER THIRD CONSECUTIVE ELECTION VICTORY IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT WHERE THE CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE THEY'RE ON COURSE TO REPLACE LABOUR AS THE MAIN OPPOSITION
LABOUR HAS RETAINED CONTROL OF SOME KEY COUNCILS IN ENGLAND HAD AT THIS STAGE IT'S LOSSES HAVEN'T BEEN AS HEAVY AS SOME HAD FORECAST IN WALES PLAID COME REALLY EARLY AND WORD HAS CAUSED AN UPSET THOUGH SHE DEFEATED LABOUR TO WIN A SEAT IN THE WELSH ASSEMBLY ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION HAVE AN AIR STRIKE ON A REFUGEE CAMP IN NORTHERN SYRIA
THERE IS NO JUSTIFIABLE EXCUSE THE CARRYING OUT AN AIR STRIKE AGAINST INNOCENT CIVILIANS WHO HAVE ALREADY WANTS FLED THEIR HOMES TO ESCAPE
WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO AN AGE GROUP HAVE BEEN HELPING REFUGEES IN THE CAMP PLUS LATER IN THE PROGRAMME HERE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I TAKE A DRIVERLESS CAR OUT ON THE MOTORWAY
THAT'S INTERESTING SOMEONE IS COMING UP ON THE INSIDE LANE NOW WHICH YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO DO THEY'RE JUST PASSED US ON THE INSIDE LANE THE CAR AS NOT PANIC THERE'S A LITTLE SIGN SUGGESTING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE
HE'S MAKING A RUDE SIGN ACTUALLY IS YOU GET A MAN IN A WHITE VAN MAKING A RUDE SIGN AND PLENTY MORE DRAMA AS WELL THE B.B.C. NEWS READ BY DOWN OR SPEAK
THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY HAVE CLAIMED VICTORY IN ELECTIONS TO THE PARLIAMENT IN EDINBURGH THEY HAVE SO FAR PICKED UP ABOUT A DOZEN CONSTITUENCY SEATS FROM LABOUR A PARTY WHICH ONCE DOMINATED SCOTTISH POLITICS WHO RISKED BEING FORCED INTO THIRD PLACE BY THE CONSERVATIVES IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS AND ENGLAND LABOUR FARED BETTER THAN MANY PREDICTED RETAINING CONTROL OF CANCELS REGARDED AS VULNERABLE
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNCIL ELECTIONS OF THE COUNCIL RESULTS ARE NOW IN LABOUR ALSO WON TWO WESTMINSTER BY ELECTIONS HOLDING ON TO OLD MOOR IN SOUTH WALES AND SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE AND HILLSBOROUGH ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE NIGHT'S EVENTS
DESPITE THE MASS OF DIFFERENT ELECTIONS LITTLE OVERALL APPEARS TO HAVE CHANGED THAT IN ITSELF WILL COME AS A HUGE RELIEF TO JEREMY CORBIN WITH LABOUR BY AND LARGE HOLDING ITS GROUND AND RETAINING COUNCILS OUTSIDE ITS TRADITIONAL COMFORT ZONE IN CRAWLEY SOUTHAMPTON IN REDDITCH IT ALSO INCREASED ITS SHARE OF THE VOTE IN THE SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE BY ELECTION
FOR MISTER CORBIN'S CRITICS HOWEVER FURTHER AMMUNITION WITH THEIR FAILURE TO MAKE PROGRESS AFTER ONE OF THE PARTY'S WORSE GENERAL ELECTION DEFEATS AND WHAT ONE DESCRIBED AS THE CATACLYSMIC UNTHINKABLE RESULT IN SCOTLAND WHERE THE PARTY LOOKS SET TO BE PUSHED INTO THIRD PLACE
FOR THE CONSERVATIVES SURPRISE AND SOME SATISFACTION THAT WITH ME A CIVIL WAR OVER EUROPE THE PARTY HAS ONLY LOST ONE COUNCIL WORCESTER AND ACHIEVED A REMARKABLE ADVANCE IN SCOTLAND AFTER YEARS IN THE POLITICAL WILDERNESS THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS APPEARED TO HAVE HALTED THEIR DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND HAVE GAINED A CLUTCH OF COUNCILLORS THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY EIGHT YEARS THEY HAVEN'T SUFFERED
CRUSHING LOSSES WHILE UKIP WHO AGAIN COME SECOND IN MANY TRADITIONAL LABOUR SEATS OR AND CALLS TO GAIN AROUND FORTY COUNSELLORS AND SECURE A REPRESENTATION ON THE WELSH ASSEMBLY FOR THE FIRST TIME
SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON'S ARE YE ES AND PEAS RE ELECTION FOR A THIRD TERM WAS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN ITS RECORD IN GOVERNMENT HOWEVER THE NATIONALISTS HAVE ALSO LOST A HANDFUL OF SEATS FOR THE CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATS LABOUR'S ONLY GAINED FROM THE S.N.P. HAS COME IN EDINBURGH SOME HERE'S A SCOT FROM CORRESPONDENT COLIN BLANE
THE S.N.P. CAME INTO THIS CAMPAIGN ON THE BACK OF TWO REMARKABLE RESULTS THEY A LANDSLIDE IN LAST YEAR'S GENERAL ELECTION AND THEY'RE STUNNING MAJORITY VICTORY IN THE PREVIOUS HOLYROOD ELECTION IN TWENTY ELEVEN
THEY'RE HEADING FOR A WIN THIS TIME TOO BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR YET WHETHER THEY'LL MANAGE ANOTHER OUTRIGHT MAJORITY
THAT'S BECAUSE THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVES UNDER RUTH DAVIDSON HAVE MADE A SERIES OF STRONG GAINS AS LABOUR'S SUPPORT HAS CONTINUED TO MELT AWAY THE SCOTTISH TORIES TO EASTWOOD UNDONE FISHER FROM LABOUR BUT THEY WON SEATS FROM THE S. M. P. TO CUPPED BY RUTH DAVIDSON'S VICTORY IN EDINBURGH CENTRAL
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER WILLIE RENNIE ALSO MANAGED TO WIN A SEAT FROM THE S.N.P.
THE U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY SAY THEY'RE HOPEFUL OF WINNING AS MANY AS EIGHT SEATS IN THE WELSH ASSEMBLY LABOUR ARE EXPECTED TO HOLD ON TO POWER BUT THEIR SHARE OF THE VOTE IS DONE BY MORE THAN EIGHT POINTS TO AROUND THIRTY THREE PER CENT THEY SUFFERED A SHOCK DEFEAT IN RUN DUNNO WHERE THE WELSH GOVERNMENT MINISTER LEIGHTON ANDREWS LOST TO THE PRIDE COMING LEADER IAN WOOD
A NEW DAWN IS ABOUT TO BREAK IN WE'RE IN THE WRONG A NEW DAWN HAS ALREADY BROKEN OVER THE VALLEYS PEOPLE HAVE VOTED FOR CHANGE
IN OTHER NEWS SIR PHILIP GREEN THE BUSINESSMAN FACING TWO PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES INTO THE SALE OF THE NOW COLLAPSED RETAILER B.H.S. HAS DEMANDED THAT FRANK FIELD RESIGN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMONS WORK AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE SIR PHILIP SAID THE VETERAN LABOUR M.P. HAD SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE CLEARLY PREJUDICED MY FIELD SAID YESTERDAY THAT HE WOULD RECOMMEND SIR PHILIP BE STRIPPED OF HIS KNIGHTHOOD IF YOU DID NOT MAKE GOOD THE STAFF PENSION DEFICIT OF B.H.S. TO FIELD IN RESPONSE TO A B. B. C. NEWS LAST NIGHT THAT PARLIAMENT WOULD NOT BE BULLIED
A FORMER SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE PRESS OFFICER SAID SHE WAS ASKED TO SPIN THE NEWS COMING OUT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST OF THE MEDIA HAYLEY COURT SAID SHE WAS EXPECTED TO PERSUADE JOURNALIST TO PUT THE FORCE IN A BETTER LIGHT SHE SAYS SHE FELT THE POLICE STRATEGY WAS TO BLAME OTHERS
IF SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE WAS GOING TO BE FOUND PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED THEN ALL THE OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES SHOULD BE FOUND PARTLY RESPONSIBLE AS WELL AND IF THAT MEANT
PATCH AWAITING THE COMMENTS ABOUT FANS BEING DRUNK IF THAT MEANT FETCH AWAITING COMMENTS ABOUT FANS FORCING GATES THEN THAT IS HOW THEY WERE GOING TO DO IT
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HAVE SAID THEY LOOKED INTO CLAIMS OF UNETHICAL PRACTICE AND THEY WERE NOT SUBSTANTIATED
THE MOST SENIOR REPUBLICAN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS THE HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN HAS SAID HE'S NOT YET READY TO ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP AS THE PARTY'S CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY HE SAID THE TYCOON WHO IS THE PARTY'S PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE HAD TO DO MORE TO UNIFY THE PARTY AND SHOW THAT HE SUPPORTED REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES IN RESPONSE MISTER TRUMP SAID HE WAS NOT YET READY TO SUPPORT MY ORION'S AGENDA
SIX AS WELL SIX TIME FOR FIRST LOOK AT THE WEATHER AND CHRIS FAWKES IS AT THE B.B.C. WEATHER CENTRE HELLO CHRIS HAS NOT JUSTIN WELL FOR MOST OF US WERE LOOKING AT A FINE AND DRY DAY YESTERDAY WAS THE WARMEST DAY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN TEMPERATURES REACHING TWENTY ONE AND A HALF DEGREES CELSIUS AT BOTH NORTH OULTON HAMPTON IN GREATER LONDON BUT IT'S A LINE THAT'S FORECAST WILL BE TROTTING OUT QUITE A LOT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS THE WARMEST DAY OF THE HAIR BECAUSE TEMPERATURES ARE SET TO RISE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS
MORE DETAIL FOR TODAY'S WEATHER FORECAST ACROSS SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS AND EASTERN ENGLAND FIRST OF ALL IT'S A FINE AND SUNNY START TO THE DAY THERE'LL BE A FEW PATCHES OF HIGH CLOUD IN THE SKY WAS AND OCCASIONALLY MAKE THE SUNSHINE A LITTLE ON THE HAZY SIDE BUT IT WILL BE WARMER THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY WITH TEMPERATURES WIDELY BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY THREE DEGREES CELSIUS THIS AFTERNOON I COULD EVEN SEE HIGHS OF TWENTY FOUR AROUND THE GREATER LONDON AREA SO ONCE AGAIN WE LIKE TO HEAR THAT PHRASE THE WARMEST DAY OF THE YEAR SO FAR
THE SOUTH WEST ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WE DO HAVE AREAS OF THICKER HIGH CLOUD THIS MORNING SO PROBABLY QUITE A CLOUDY BUT BRIGHT START TO THE DAY FOR MANY AREAS AS THE SUN CLIMBS HIGHER IN THE SKY IT WILL COME THROUGH THIS CLOUDS WERE LOOKING AT HAZY SUNSHINE REALLY DEVELOPING THROUGH THE DAY TODAY AND STAYING DRY FOR MOST ARE LOW TOWARDS THE EVENING TIME THERE IS A RISK OF JUST ONE OR TWO SHOWERS RUNNING INTO THE FAR SOUTH WEST OF SOUTH WEST ENGLAND OTHERWISE A FINE LOOKING DAY WITH TEMPERATURES BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS
IN NORTHERN IRELAND A RATHER CLOUDY START TO THE DAY FOR MOST AREAS BUT WESTERN COUNTIES START THE DAY ON A SUNNY NOTE IT'S EVEN QUITE CHILLY HERE WITH A TOUCH OF FROST IN RURAL AREAS BUT STAYING BRIGHT'S TODAY HIGHS OF SIXTEEN DEGREES IN SCOTLAND A CLOUDY START AS WELL THERE'LL BE SOME BRIGHT SPELLS COMING AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY HOUSE REACH EIGHTEEN DEGREES IN JUST A FEW SHOWERS INTO THE HIGHLANDS AND THE WESTERN ISLES THAT'S LATEST WEATHER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHRIS IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN BUT WE'RE ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO LEARN LET ALONE ANALYSE WHAT EXACTLY THEY'VE SAID LEASE SURPRISING BUT NO LESS SIGNIFICANT FOR THAT IS THE FACT THAT SCOTT WANT SCOTLAND WILL BE GOVERNED FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS BY THE S.N.P. AND NICOLA STURGEON WILL CONTINUE AS FIRST MINISTER
WHAT IS NO MEN BEYOND DATE IS AT THE S.N.P. HAS WON I THOUGHT CONSECUTIVE
SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ELECTION THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
MAIDS HISTORY
THIS THERE WAS NOT A NIGHT WHEN THE S.N.P. SWEPT THE BOARD AS MANY HAD PREDICTED ONE REASON THE RISE OF THE TORIES IN SCOTLAND WHO MIGHT DO THE ONCE COMPLETELY UNTHINKABLE TAKES SECOND PLACE FROM LABOUR TO BECOME THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION IN HOLYROOD THIS IS HOW THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON GREETED THAT PROSPECT AFTER HER OWN VICTORY
DAVIDSON SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE
BUT JUST THAT RUTH DAVIDSON
IF I AM BUYING ANY SMALL MEASURE ELECTED TO BE THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY I PROMISE THAT I WILL SERVE TO THE VERY BEST OF MY ABILITY
LABOUR M.P. AND CORBIN CRITIC JOHN MAN SAID THAT RESULT WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE IT WOULD BE CATACLYSMIC FOR LABOUR PARTY MORALE BUT HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS TIME TO CHALLENGE MISTER CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WINNING BY A LANDSLIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THE WAY THIS TORY GOVERNMENT'S BEEN ACTING AND THE WAY THEY'VE DEALT WITH THE COUNTRY THE COLLAPSE IN ECONOMIC CONFIDENCE
WE'RE DOING O.K. NOT BAD RESULTS WE'RE HOLDING OUR OWN BUT WE SHOULD BE DOING DRAMATICALLY BETTER THAN THIS BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR ANY CHALLENGE
DOING O.K. HE SAID OTHER CRITICS OF THE LABOUR LEADER HOPING THE RESULTS OVERALL WOULD HAND THEM AN EXCUSE FOR A CHALLENGE I'M SURE TO BE DISAPPOINTED WHILST LABOUR HAVE MADE LOSSES IN ENGLISH COUNCIL ELECTIONS THE PARTY'S DONE A LOT BETTER IN THE SOUTH THAN THEY DARED TO HOPE HOLDING ON TO COUNCILS IN PLACES LIKE EXETER HASTINGS NORWICH SOUTHAMPTON AND CRAWLEY
AND I DO HEREBY DECLARE THAT CARLOS PORTAL CASTRO LABOUR PARTY IS DULY ELECTED AS THE COUNCIL THE TILDA
WE WILL OF COURSE BE BRINGING YOU MORE RESULTS AS THEY COME IN MORE ANALYSIS AND HEARING FROM SOME OF THE KEEP AND LET'S GO TO SCOTLAND AT TEN PAST SIX AND THE COLIN BLAINE ASCOT CORRESPONDENTS IN OUR STUDIO IN GLASGOW DID JUST BRING US UP TO DATE COLANDER WE KNOW ANY MORE THAN WE DID TEN MINUTES AGO WHEN THE NEWS WAS ON
NOT MUCH MORE JUSTIN BUT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THIS HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS NIGHT FOR THE S.N.P. THEY'VE DONE VERY VERY WELL BUT THERE'S A SUSPICION THAT THEY'VE BEEN THE VICTIM PERHAPS OF OF EXAGGERATED EXPECTATIONS THAT THERE WAS SUCH TALK ABOUT THEM DOING AS WELL AS THEY DID FIVE YEARS AGO THEY MAY FALL A LITTLE SHORT THAT'S NOT CLEAR YET BECAUSE OF OF THE LIST OF STUFF STILL TO COME IN THOSE OF THE VOTES
KIND OF BALANCE AND CORRECTS UPPED IT TO GIVE A MORE PROPORTIONAL SYSTEM HERE BUT THE S.N.P. HAVE DONE EXTREMELY WELL HOWEVER THE STORY THAT I THINK IT'S CAUGHT EVERYBODY'S EYE IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVES APPEARED TO HAVE BONES BACK REMARKABLY
PART OF THIS IS BECAUSE LABOUR HAVE CONTINUED TO DECLINE AND IN MANY MANY SEATS EVEN WHERE THE CONSERVATIVES DIDN'T WIN IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY ARE VOTE HAD GONE UP AND LABOUR'S HAD GONE DOWN SO A PRETTY DISASTROUS NIGHT AGAIN FOR THE FOR THE LABOUR PARTY IN SCOTLAND BUT A VERY GOOD NIGHT FOR THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVES AND
TYPIFIED REALLY BY THE ASTONISHING RESULT RUTH DAVIDSON THE PARTY LEADER MANAGED TO WIN AN EDINBURGH CENTRAL THAT REALLY WASN'T EXPECTED CERTAINLY NOT BY OBSERVERS THAT SHE WOULD MAKE IT BUT SHE DID AND THE ONE ANOTHER AND ANOTHER NUMBER OF PRETTY GOOD RESULTS AS WELL I MEAN THE CONSERVATIVES TO EASTWOOD WHICH HAD BEEN ONE OF THEIR HEARTLANDS MANY MANY YEARS AGO BUT WAS IN LEAVE US HANDS FOR A LONG TIME THEY ALSO TOOK THEM FREE SURE FROM LABOUR
SORTS IF THEY'VE HAD AN EXTREMELY GOOD NIGHT THAT THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WE MAY BE DISTRACTING FROM WHAT HE'S ALSO BEEN A TERRIFIC NIGHT FROM THE WINNERS FROM THE S. AND P. AND THAT PUT A PRETTY PRETTY GOOD FOR THE CONSERVATIVES GREAT FOR THE S.N.P. AND A DISASTER FOR LABOUR WHEN ARE WE GOING TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN COLIN WHETHER LABOUR OR THE CONSERVATIVES ARE IN SECOND PLACE
I THINK IT WILL BE ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS BECAUSE IT'S ALL GOING TO DEPEND ON THE REGIONAL LIST VORWARTS IT WE'VE HAD ONE REGION IN THAT PROVIDE SEVEN SEATS WE'VE GOT ANOTHER SEVEN BECOMES
WAITING FOR A FORTY NINE AND A COUPLE OF CONSTITUENCY ONCE OR STILL MORE THAN FIFTY SEATS TO COME IN BUT IT'LL TAKE SHAPE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS AND JUST LOOKING AT THE POLITICS OF IT AND WHAT IT TELLS THE S.N.P. THIS VICTORY BUT IT'S A KIND OF VICTORY BUT DOT DOT DOT OR DOES IT SUGGEST TO THEM THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION THE BUSINESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER REFERENDUM WEATHER UP TO TO TO LEAVE THE U.K. THAT ACTUALLY THAT AT LEAST IN PARTS OF SCOTLAND DAMAGES
THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT RUTH DAVIDSON THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER HAS BEEN PUTTING OUT AND SHE ARGUED VERY STRONGLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN IN FACT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CAMPION ARGUED VERY STRONGLY THAT THIS WAS A DISTRACTION AND THAT THE PUBLIC DIDN'T WANT IT AND THAT'S THAT'S A LINE THAT'S BEEN TAKEN UP BY THE SCOTTISH LIBERAL DEMOCRATS AS WELL SO IS IT TRUE WELL WE WILL SEE WHAT NICOLA STURGEON HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT SEE WHAT SHE THINKS ABOUT IT BUT CERTAINLY HER OPPONENTS BELIEVE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION HAS DAMAGED THE S.N.P.
COLLARBONE AND GLASGOW BACKS IT IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGE OF THE PAPERS THEY OF COURSE THE FIRST EDITIONS AT LEAST WERE PRINTED A LONG LONG TIME BEFORE ANY RESULTS CAME THROUGH SO THERE'S A RANGE OF OTHER STORIES ON THE FRONT PAGE THE DAILY MIRROR'S HEADLINE COPS PROBE TORIES OVER ELECTION CASH THEY CLAIM IT'S AN EXCLUSIVE OF COURSE THE PAPER ALONG THE CHANNEL FOUR NEWS TO BE MAKING THE RUNNING ON A SERIES OF ALLEGATIONS THAT THE CONSERVATIVES OVERSPENT ON THEIR GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS BUSSING PEOPLE IN LARGE
NUMBERS TWO CAMPAIGNS IN THEY'RE NOT PUTTING IT AGAINST THOSE LOCAL SPENDING LIMITS WHICH ARE LEGALLY BINDING AND IF THEY WERE FOUND TO BE BROKEN COULD LEAD TO A RERUN OF CERTAIN ELECTIONS AND EVEN TO PEOPLE BEING IN PRISON THE PAPER SAYS PRESSURE IS MOUNTING ON MORE POLICE FORCES TO PROBE AT LEAST ANOTHER TWENTY TORY M.P.S OVER CLAIMS THAT THEY BROKE ELECTION SPENDING LAW
GUARDIANS MAINLY STORY IS ABOUT THE RETURN TO PEACE TALKS IN THE DISPUTE BETWEEN JUNIOR DOCTORS AND THE GOVERNMENT BUT THEIR HEADLINE IS DOCTOR SPLIT OVER RETURN TO THOSE PEACE TALKS IN THE GUARDIAN SAYS B.M.A. INSIDERS SAY THAT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS' COMMITTEE HAD BEEN RUNNING THE STRIKES SOME MEMBERS OF WHICH FAVOUR AN INDEFINITE ALL OUT STRIKE ON MASS RESIGNATIONS IS GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE AGREEING NOW TO WHAT EXACTLY DID DO FACES
THE GUARDIAN SAYS A POTENTIALLY STORMY SESSION WHEN IT MEETS OVER THE WEEKEND THE J.D. C. WILL BE SAYS ONE OFFICIAL TO THE GUARDIAN ARE DIVIDED HOUSE
AT A QUARTER PAST SIX IT'S TIME FOR THE BUSINESS NEWS AND WHEN I LISTEN TO A LITTLE BIT OF HOW TIDAL POWER COULD HELP TO MEET THE U.K.'S ENERGY NEEDS IS LUCY BUT MONOMERS GOOD MORNING NICK WITH THE U.K. IT MAY BE AN ISLAND THAT MANY PEOPLE FEEL WE DON'T MAKE THE MOST OF ITS NATURAL ENERGY RESOURCES BE THAT SOLAR WIND OR TIDAL THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS PART HAS MADE IT CLEAR IT'S PREFERENCE FOR MEETING THE ENERGY NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY IS NUCLEAR
A FRIDAY BOSS SAYS HE'S READY TO START BUILDING A TIDAL LAGOON AND SWANSEA BAY WHICH COULD GENERATE EIGHT PER CENT OF THE U.K.'S ELECTRICITY WILL BE CHATTING TO MUCH IN JUST A MOMENT TO FIND OUT MORE BUT FIRST LET'S CHECK IN QUICKLY WITH THE MARKETS AND RICHARD JEFFREY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE CASANOVA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IS HERE GOOD MORNING RICHARD MORNING THE ROW OVER B.H.S. CONTINUES DOESN'T IT THE FORMER OWNER SIR PHILIP GREEN HAS COOLED ON THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMONS COMMITTEE EXAMINING THE COLLAPSE OF THE CHAIN TO RESIGN
THIS COMES AFTER FRANK FIELD SAID HE WOULD RECOMMEND STRIPPING SIR PHILIP OF HIS KNIGHTHOOD IF YOU DIDN'T PAY FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION INTO THE B.H.S. PENSION FUND IS THIS IS GETTING PERSONAL NOW
IT IS GETTING VERY PERSONAL I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT TRIAL BY NEWSPAPER HEADLINE WHAT YOU WANT IS TRIAL BY FACT AND THE FACT OF COURSE ON ONE SIDE YOU'VE GOT AN AILING BRANDON IN B.H.S. ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU'VE GOT A PENSION FUND WITH AN APPARENTLY VERY LARGE DEFICIT I CAN TELL YOU VALUING PENSION FUNDS IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND JUST TRYING TO JUDGE WHAT THE SHORTFALL THIS IS EVEN HARDER BUT I THINK WE NEED A LOT MORE OFF A FACT ON THE LOT LESS RHETORIC AND PRESUMABLY THERE ISN'T ANY PRECEDENT FOR THIS
I WEREN'T THERE IS PRECEDENT FOOT FOR THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND HER HAVING TO COME IN AND SUPPORT PENSION FUNDS AND OF COURSE THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF PRECEDENT FOR BRANDS WHICH HAVE BECOME TIRED AND OLD DISAPPEARING FROM THE HIGH STREET THIS IS THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL IF WE LOOK AHEAD NOW TO EVENTS HAPPENING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC U.S. JOB FIGURES OUT LATER WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING TO SEE AND IS THAT IMPORTANT
THE JOB FIGURES IN THE UNITED STATES A VERY IMPORTANT THEY'RE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FIGURES OF THE MONTH NOW WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THE UNITED STATES IS VERY STRONG JOB GENERATION OVER RECENT YEARS I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANOTHER DECENT SET OF NUMBERS TODAY PROBABLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS CREATED IN THE MONTH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FALLING FROM FIVE PERCENT TO FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT BUT THAT SEEM SMALL BUT I THINK THAT BEGINS TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN TERMS OF INTEREST RATES AND AT THE SAME TIME AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
SO WAGE INFLATION BEGINNING TO PICK UP MAYBE A LITTLE BIT FASTER AN INCREASE OF MAYBE POINT THREE POINT FOUR PER CENT ON THE MONTH SO THAT SUGGESTING THAT INFLATIONARY PRESSURE IS BEGINNING TO COME THROUGH BECAUSE THE LABOUR MARKET EST IS TIGHTENING THE FEDERAL RESERVE COURSES HAS RAISED INTEREST RATES INTEREST RATES ONCE IT HAD PROJECTED MORE RATE INCREASES FOR THIS YEAR IT SEEMS TO PULL BACK FROM THAT I THINK THESE SORTS OF NUMBERS ACTUALLY WORK WILL PUSH THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN TWO FURTHER INTEREST RATE INCREASES THIS YEAR
RICHARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE KNOW THAT THE NUMBER OF WOMEN ON BOARDS OR IN LEADERSHIP POSSESSIONS AND BUSINESS IS TOO LOW WE ALSO KNOW THERE'S A GENDER PAY GAP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WITH MANY MEN STILL EARNING MORE THAN THEIR FEMALE COUNTERPARTS STUDIES BY CORPORATION LIKE GOLDMAN SACHS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE POTENTIAL INCREASE TO G.D.P. IF WOMEN HAD THE SAME ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT AND CREDIT AS MEN NOW TO COUNTERBALANCE AS IN A QUALITY THERE'S A GROWING MOVEMENT CALLED GENDER LENS INVESTING
AND REPORT OUT THIS MORNING FROM THE THINK TECH THAN YOUNG FOUNDATION IS CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND WIDER U.K. SOCIAL INVESTMENT SECTOR TO INCREASE SAY USE OF GENDER LENS INVESTING WERE JOINING US IS CARRIE GOT OUT HE'S A DIRECTOR OF A QUALITY AT THE YOUNG FOUNDATION SHE WROTE THE REPORT GOOD MORNING FIRST OF ALL GENDER LENS INVESTING ISN'T A TERM I'VE HEARD OF BEFORE WOOD IS IT AND WHY DO WE NEED IT OH GOOD MORNING WELL
IN ESSENCE GENDERLESS INVESTING IS THE USE OF CAPITAL BOTH TO GENERATE FINANCIAL RETURN AND TO ADVANCE GENDER EQUALITY IT'S A BASICALLY IT'S A SOCIAL INVESTMENT BUT IT'S ALSO VERY SMART INVESTMENT IT'S IT'S THREE BROAD AREAS FIRST OF ALL IT'S CHANNELLING YOUR CAPITAL OF FINANCE TO WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS
OR IT'S CHANNELLING CAPITAL TO DIVERSE BUSINESSES WITH GOOD EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND CRITICALLY THROUGHOUT THEIR INPUT THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN OR IT CAN INVOLVE INVESTING IN GOODS AND SERVICES THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT WOMEN AND GIRLS AND ACTUALLY DELIBERATELY TRYING TO TACKLE GENDER INEQUALITY AND OF COURSE INVESTORS WILL WANT TO SEE SOME PROOF OF RETURN ON THERE SO IT WOULD EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT THIS WORKS
WE'LL LOOK AT INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE BODY AND I THINK LOOKING AT THE THREE INTERN I MEAN IN TERMS OF INVESTING IN WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS ON THE BUSINESS SIDE UM IN THERE'S CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE EVIDENT YOUR INVESTMENT IS MORE SECURE AND YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET
A HIGHER RETURN I MEAN BASICALLY ONE ARE JUST MORE CAPITAL EFFICIENT I THINK ON THE SOCIAL SIDE THERE'S BIGGER EVIDENCE THAT IT CLOSES THE CREDIT GAP OF WOMEN AND WHICH HE JUST HE JUST REFERENCED AND KIND OF ON A MORE MACRO SCALE DO YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS YOU KNOW THE MORE YOU INVEST IN WOMEN THE MORE BANK
THANK YOU BUT YOU GET IN TERMS OF REDUCING POVERTY AND BUILDING STRONGER COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY AND INVESTING INTO THOSE COMPANIES EMBOSSED IN PROVES THE BOTTOM LINE I MEAN THERE'S THINGS SUCH AS THE NEW GLOBAL PACKS INDEX WHICH ACTUALLY RATES COMPANIES ON HOW DIVERSE THEY ARE SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW COMPANIES GET A HIGHER PROFIT WITH MORE DIVERSE
BORED AND THEN FINALLY I THINK THE THING ABOUT INVESTING IN WOMEN AND GIRLS AND THOSE GOODS AND SERVICES YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER ECONOMICALLY WE KNOW THAT WE COULD SEE UP TO A THREE PERCENT INCREASE IN G.D.P. IF WE COULD TACKLE GENDER EQUALITY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT ALSO WE COULD SEE LESS POVERTY LESS WELFARE PAYMENTS AND GENERALLY HAPPIER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE SOCIETY KERRY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN A SONG HE GETS RELEASED PLAYED IN A COFFEE SHOP AND THEN ON AN ADVERT THEN IT'S USED IN A FILM AND EVENTUALLY IT BECOMES A WORLD WIDE HIT BUT HOW DO YOU GET PAID FOR THIS THERE'S AN ORGANISATION OUT THERE THAT LOOKS AFTER YOU THE PERFORMING RIGHTS SOCIETY YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN ONE OF THEIR STICKERS ON THE DOOR OF YOUR LOCAL HAIRDRESSERS OR CAFE AND THIS YEAR THE GROUPS IN A BIG RISE IN ROYALTIES UP SEVEN PERCENT TO FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION AS A RESULT OF THAT AN EXTRA THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO ITS MEMBERS
BUT ASH CRAFTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF P.R. ESSES HERE RICHARD GOOD MORNING LOOKING AT THESE FIGURES IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD TIME TO BE A SONGWRITER IN THE DIGITAL AGE WELL THERE ARE RISKS AND CHALLENGES AND THEN THERE ARE THE BENEFITS WE HAVE BEEN GROWING THE BUSINESS AS YOU CAN SEE ACROSS ALL OF OUR REVENUE CATEGORIES BUT WE'RE STILL FACED WITH CHALLENGES IN THE ONLINE MARKET TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT OPERATES EFFICIENTLY AND THAT BOTH THE ARTIST SON SONGWRITERS CAN BE PROPERLY PAID
WHAT DOES IT TELL US ABOUT THE HEALTH I SUPPOSE OF THE INDUSTRY AT THE MOMENT I THINK THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IS ON THE UP AT THE MOMENT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE HAVE A FANTASTIC SONGWRITERS IN THIS COUNTRY WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN OVERSEAS MARKETS PEOPLE LISTEN TO BRITISH MUSIC EVERYWHERE I WAS IN BUENOS AIRES A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO LISTENING TO A COVER BAND DOING ROLLING STONES HEAD SO MUSIC REMAINS POPULAR AROUND THE WORLD
YOU JUST MENTIONED THE ROLLING STONES AND OF COURSE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SONGWRITING COPYRIGHT ISSUES THEY'VE BEEN ASKING DONALD TRUMP TO STOP PLAYING MUSIC AT HIS RALLIES HOW DO YOU GUYS FIT INTO THIS WELL THAT REALLY IS A DECISION FOR THE SONGWRITER OF THE PERFORMER THEMSELVES THERE IS BOTH AN ECONOMIC RIGHTS IN THE MORAL RIGHT IN MUSIC SO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY NO I DON'T WANT MY MUSIC PLAYED IN THAT CONTEXT SO
EXPLAIN TO ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW P. R. S. WORKS HOW YOU POLICE THE USE OF THE MUSIC WELL IF YOU TAKE ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE B. B. C. IN THE OTHER BROADCASTERS OF THE BIG ONLINE PROVIDERS THEY REPORT TO US THEIR USE OF MUSIC AND OF COURSE THEY USING SOUND RECORDINGS ALL LIVE PERFORMANCE AND WE THEN HAVE TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND MATCH IT TO WHO WROTE AND PUBLISHED THEIR SONG
AND LAST YEAR WE PROCESS TWO TRILLION OF THESE THAT SOME TWENTY TIMES MORE TRANSACTIONS THAN VISA DOES WORLDWIDE SO IT'S AN ENORMOUS JOB IT'S A BIG DATA INTENSIVE BACK OFFICE JOB AND WE STARTED A JOINT VENTURE WITH THE GERMANS IN THE SWEDES TO COPE WITH THE SHEER SCALE OF THAT
ROBERT ASHCROFT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW THE ENERGY MINISTER LORD MOON CALLS IT AN EXCITING BUT UNTESTED TECHNOLOGY BUT THERE'S A GROWING BODY OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE POWER OF TIDES COULD BE THE ANSWER TO OUR ENERGY NEEDS ARE FRIDAY BOSS MARK SHARK IS THE C.E.O. OF TIDAL LAGOON POWER HE JOINS US FROM OUR STUDIO IN OXFORD GOOD MORNING MARK GOOD MORNING
YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN BUILDING THE WORLD'S FIRST TIDAL LAGOON IN SWANSEA BAY ONE OR FOUR PLANNED IN WALES FOR THE UNINITIATED HOW WOULD IT WORK WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE OH KAY SO SWANSEA BAY TIDAL LAGOON OUR PROPOSAL WHICH WHICH WE HAVE PLANNING CONSENT FOR IS TO BUILD A
NINE KILOMETRE U. SHAPED BREAKWATER OUT FROM THE DOCKS IN SWANSEA AND BACKGROUND TO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER NEATH IN PATEL BUT AND THAT NINE AND A HALF KILOMETRE BREAK WATER WILL IMPOUND ELEVEN AND A HALF SQUARE KILOMETRES OF SEA
AND WE'RE REALLY BLESSED IN THE U.K. IN THAT WE'VE GOT THIS ENORMOUS TIDAL RANGE BOTH IN THE SEVERN ESTUARY AND IN LIVERPOOL BAY AND SO IN SWANSEA BAY WE HAVE A
TEN AND A HALF METRE TIDAL RANGE AND SO WHAT WE DO IN THE OUTER PERIMETER OF THE BREAKWATER IS WE BUILD A TURBINE HOUSE FOUR HUNDRED METRES LONG WITH A FEW WILL SIXTEEN HORIZONTAL PLUG HOLES IN IT AND IN EACH OF THOSE PLUG HOLES IS A SEVEN METRE RUNNER DIAMETER SEVEN METRE DIAMETER HYDRO TURBINE AND IF YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S HIGH TIDE IN SWANSEA BAY AND HIGH TIDE IN THIS TIDAL LAGOON I JUST DESCRIBED
IF WE KEEP THE GATE SHUT IN THAT TURBINE HOUSE FOR THREE HOURS THE TIDES IN THE WIDER SWANSEA BAY WILL ALREADY HAVE DROPPED BY FOUR METRES SO HOW MUCH ENERGY WOULD IT GENERATE DO YOU THINK SO SO WILL GENERATE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY AND SWANSEA MIGHT EITHER GOING FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES AND WE CAN KEEP ON GENERATING FOR THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS WITH THAT ONE POWER STATION SO THE GOVERNMENT'S BEEN SAYING THAT A BIT MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO DETERMINE WHETHER TIDAL LAGOON ENTITY PRESENT VALUE FOR MONEY SO HOW COST EFFECTIVE WILL IT BE
I THINK IT LET ME GIVE IT A COMPARISON THIS WAY THE SWANSEA BAY A LAGOON IS IS A PATHFINDER IT'S SUB SCALE IN TERMS OF THE VOLUME OF WATER LARGE BODIES OF WATER MAKE VERY CHEAP POWER SO A SWANSEA BAY PROJECT FOR A FIRST OF KIND WILL COST IN LINE WITH
THE ENERGY COMING OUT OF HINKLEY POINT POWER STATION AND A NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY IT'S GOT SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ONCE YOU GET TO THE LARGER SCALE THE GOONS SAYING CARDIFF SAY IN NEWPORT SAY OF COLWYN BAY WE WOULD EXPECT TO BE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE POUNDS CHEAPER THAN NUCLEAR AND ABOUT TEN POUNDS CHEAPER THAN GAS SO PRETTY COST EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU THINK THAT WE ARE
A NATION THAT'S GOT CURRENTLY EIGHTY FIVE GIG HAVE INSTALLED CAPACITY INSTALL POWER STATIONS AND THIRTY EIGHT KICK OF THOSE AND POWER STATIONS REACH END OF LIFE IN THE NEXT DECADE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SOME CHOICES ABOUT WHAT OUR NEW POWER STATIONS LOOK LIKE AND BECAUSE THE TIDAL SHIFT AROUND THE U.K.
MOVES UP THE COAST YOU CAN HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR GENERATION FROM TIDAL LAGOONS BECAUSE WHEN THOSE IN THE SEVEN AUSTRIA OFF THOSE IN LIVERPOOL THEY WOULD BE ON AND VICE VERSA MARKED TIS VERY QUICKLY CAN YOU TELL ME HOW IMPORTANT THE INDUSTRY IS TO SECURING THE FUTURE OF SOUTH WALES WELL
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT WE ARE BASICALLY BASED IN THE SWANSEA CITY REGION SO THAT COVERS PATEL THAT NEATH AND SWANSEA WE'VE WE'VE PROPOSED THAT THIS IS A NEW INDUSTRY GLOBAL INDUSTRY REALLY THAT WILL MAKE TURBINES
GENERATORS AND TURBINE HOUSES HERE IN THE U.K. SO OUR PATHFINDER PROJECT SWANSEA BAY THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT A SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUND ORDER BUT IF WE THINK OF THE FIRST FULL SCALE LAGOON IT CARDIFF
JUST THE TURBINES AND GENERATORS THERE'S A TWO POINT FOUR BILLION POUND BUDGET BUDGET PRICE AND WHAT WE'VE WORKED TO DO WITH SWANSEA IS THE PATHFINDER IS TO WORK UP A SUPPLY CHAIN THAT WILL BE BASED IN SOUTH WALES AND BASED IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AT THE INTERNS A BOLD NUMBERS
THE THREE BIG LAGOONS OFF TO SWANSEA IN WALES REPRESENT SEVENTEEN BILLION POUNDS OF INVESTMENT SPENT IN PREDOMINANTLY IN WALES AND PART IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THAT LIKE SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING LUXURY

THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THEIR VOTE SHARE IN SCOTLAND AND GAINED FOUR SEATS THE SCOTTISH LIB DEMS SAY THEY'VE TURNED A CORNER HOLDING TWO AND GAINING TWO SEATS IN THE ENGLISH LOCAL ELECTIONS THERE'S BEEN LITTLE CHANGE LABOUR HAVE DONE BETTER THAN WAS EXPECTED HOLDING ON T'COUNCIL SUCH A SOUTHAMPTON REDDITCH AND CRAWLEY WHICH WAS SEEN AS VULNERABLE THEY'VE WON THE MAYORAL ELECTION IN LIVERPOOL AND HELD UP MORE AND SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE UNTIL IN THE TWO PARLIAMENTARY BY ELECTIONS
THE CONSERVATIVES SAY THEY HAVE PERFORMED SOLIDLY IN ENGLAND HOLDING ALL THAT ONE OF THE COUNCIL'S THEY CONTROLLED ALTHOUGH THE PARTY'S VOTE SHARE HAS FALLEN IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY IN WALES LABOUR'S VOTE SHARE HAS GONE DOWN AND IN A MAJOR UPSET THE PARTY HAS LOST RHONDA TO THE CLYDE COME LEADER LEANNE WOOD BUT THEY ARE WRONG COURSE TO WIN ENOUGH SUITS TO RUN AN EFFECTIVE MINORITY ADMINISTRATION UKIP IS IN LINE FOR REPRESENTATION IN THE WELSH ASSEMBLY FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PARTY HAS TAKEN AROUND THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE SHARE OF THE VOTE
RESULTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AREN'T EXPECTED UNTIL MUCH LATER IN THE DAY RESULTS ARE ALSO TO COME IN MAYORAL CONTESTS IN LONDON BRISTOL AND SALFORD AND ELECTIONS FOR POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONERS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES SOME OF THE OTHER NEWS HEADLINES A SINEW UNITED NATIONS OFFICIAL HAS SAID THE BOMBING YESTERDAY OF A REFUGEE CAMP IN SYRIA COULD AMOUNT TO A WAR CRIME THE RETAILER SIR PHILIP GREEN HAS DEMANDED THAT FRANK FIELD STEP DOWN AS CHAIR OF A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE LOOKING INTO THE SOUND OF B.H.S. ACCUSING HIM OF BEING CLEARLY PREJUDICED
THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET US START WITH THE ELECTION RESULTS AS FAR AS WE KNOW THEM IN ENGLAND ON SMITH HER ASSISTANT LATER EDITOR ON THE LINE AND NO ONE WHAT MATTERS WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU LOOK OUT AND RAISE YOUR EYEBROWS AT SO FAR IN ENGLAND
I THINK THE STRIKING THING AND THE SIGNIFICANT THING IS ACTUALLY NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED WE'VE HAD TIME TO SAY A NIGHT OF SORT OF HOT STEAMY ELECTIONS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE EARTH HASN'T MOVED MUCH FOR ANYONE FOR MISTER CORBIN THAT MUST COME AS ONE A HUGE
RELIEF BECAUSE HE HAS BY AND LARGE HELD HIS GROUND HE PROBABLY END UP LOSING I DO TWENTY THIRTY OR SO SEEDS BUT IT'S CONTAINABLE HE'S MANAGED TO HOLD ON TO VULNERABLE COUNCILS SUCH AS CRAWLEY REDDITCH SOUTHAMPTON IN THE SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE BY ELECTION MET HIS SHARE OF THE VOTE CREPT UP BY FIVE POINTS AND OVERALL I THINK LABOUR'S SHARE OF THE VOTE COMPARED TO THE LOCAL ELECTIONS LAST YEAR'S UP FOUR POINTS
THESE RESULTS DO NOT GIVE HIS CRITICS THE TRIGGER TO LAUNCH ANY SORT OF CHALLENGE AGAINST HIM THAT SAID
IF YOU PUT THIS IN A BROADER CONTEXT IT UNDERLINES THE DIRE DOLDRUMS LABOUR HAS NOW SUNK INTO BECAUSE EVERY LABOUR LEADER
IN THEIR FIRST YEAR HAS ALWAYS WON SEATS AT LOCAL COUNCIL ELECTIONS EVEN MICHAEL FOOT WHEN HE BECAME LEADER WON NEARLY A THOUSAND SEATS YOU LOOK AT SCOTLAND WHICH MISTER CORBIN SAID WAS GOING TO BE A PRIORITY I MEAN A SHATTERING AND HISTORIC DEFEAT BEING PUSHED INTO THIRD PLACE
AND AT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FRANKLY IS IN NEAR CIVIL WAR OVER EUROPE HAS BEEN BATTERED BY ROWS OVER THE BUDGET OVER DISABILITY BENEFITS OVER THE STEEL INDUSTRY U. TURNS OVER OR DEFEATS OVER SUNDAY TRADING AND CHILD MIGRANTS
THE OPPOSITION SHOULD BE TAKING CHUNKS OUT OF THEM AND IN A HISTORICAL CONTEXT MISTER CORBIN'S IMMEDIATE POSITION MAY NOT BE AT THREAT BUT THE UNEASE AND FEAR AMONGST MANY LABOUR M.P.S THAT THEY ARE GOING NOWHERE AND I'M NOT IN ANY SHAPE TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION WILL BE CONFIRMED BY THESE RESULTS TO JUST THE RESULT THE NUMBER TEN WOULD HAVE WANTED
I MEAN FROM A CONSERVATIVE PERSPECTIVES THEY HAVE TO BE PRETTY PLEASED I GUESS THAT DESPITE ALL THAT MAYHEM GOING AROUND GOING ON AROUND THEM THE ONLY COUNCIL THEY HAVE LOST AND ONLY JUST WAS WORCESTER AND UNDOUBTEDLY THEY WILL POINT TO SCOTLAND WHERE FRANKLY FRANKLY THE PARTY'S BEEN
DEAD FOR YEARS IT'S BEEN IN THE POLITICAL WILDERNESS THERE COME BACK MAYBE VERY LARGELY DOWN TO RUTH DAVIDSON'S PERSONALITY AND PENS HOURS NEVERTHELESS IT IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS SIX YEARS AFTER THEY CAME INTO GOVERNMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A STIRRER T. TO BE HOLDING YOUR GROUND IS NOT A BAD ACHIEVEMENT
ALMOST WORTH WILL BE HEARING FROM YOU LATER ON THE PROGRAMME THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HEAD OVER TO CARDIFF NOW TO THE WELSH ASSEMBLY TO BE PRECISE WHERE OUR CORRESPONDENT HOWELL GRIFFITHS IS WAITING FOR US IF THE NEWS WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER FOR LABOUR IN ENGLAND THAN THEY FEARED PRETTY GRIM IN WALES FOR LABOUR
WE DON'T REALLY DO POLITICAL EARTHQUAKES HERE BUT CERTAINLY LABOUR ARE PROBABLY FEELING A FEW TREMORS THE HEADLINE MAYBE THE ONLY REALLY HEADLINE SO FAR FROM THE COUNT IS A DRAMATIC LOSS IN THE RON THERE ARE PROPER LABOUR HEARTLAND SEAT
WITH A WELL RESPECTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND ANDREW'S LOSING OUT TO MAYBE THE BIG WINNER SO FAR LEANNE WOOD THE LEADER APPLIED COUNTRY PREVIOUSLY SHE HELD A REGIONAL SEAT BUT SHE BRAVED IT AND WENT FOR A CONSTITUENCY FEET SHE TOOK ON LABOUR IN THEIR HEARTLAND AND SHE HAD A TWENTY FOUR PERCENT SWING
DON'T TAKE THAT TO BE THE SITUATION WILL BE REPLICATED ACROSS WILL SUPPLY COME WE'RE NOT EXPECTING THAT EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE AT THE MOMENT IT IS VERY MUCH ABOUT HER PERSONAL VOTE ON THE PLATFORM SHE ACHIEVED LAST YEAR IN THE GENERAL ELECTION WHEN SHE WAS PART OF THE U.K. LEADERS' DEBATE
PLAY CAN BE THAT SAID WE'LL HOPE TO BECOME THE SECOND LARGEST PARTY IN WALES AFTER LABOUR WILL PUT THEM IN A STRONG POSITION BUT LABEL IT REALLY WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS THINKING THEY WON'T GET THE OVERALL MAJORITY IN THE SENATE BUT MAYBE THEY CAN DO A DEAL WITH ONE OF THE OTHER PARTIES TO IMPLEMENT THEIR POLICIES AND THAT SAID UKIP HAVE DONE WELL ACROSS THE BORDERS A PARTY NOT JUST FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL
YET YOU GO FROM ZERO WITH UKIP AND THEY'RE LOOKING MAYBE TO GET ABOUT FIVE SIX MAYBE SEVEN SEAT NONE SO FAR AND THAT'S BECAUSE AGAIN THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN WALES CONSTITUENCIES AND REGIONS THE REGIONAL SEATS WILL START TO COME THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS THEIR VOTE SHARE SUGGESTS A THIRTEEN PERCENT SWING THAT SHOULD DELIVER THEM THE FIVE SEAT AS A MINIMUM AND AN INTERESTIN RETURNED TO POLITICS FOR THE LIKES OF NEIL HAMILTON WHO IS FULLY EXPECTED TO BECOME AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER
SURGEON PARTIES THEY LIKE TO BRAND THEMSELVES MATE MIGHT HAVE LIVEN UP WELSH POLITICS OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IF AND WHEN THEY GET THE SEAT
WE HEARD PETER HAIN THE FORMER WELSH SECRETARY SAY THAT LOSS IN RONDA WAS A TERRIBLE SHOCK THEY ALMOST LOST LABOUR IN BLAENAU GWENT AS WELL HE'S THERE ARE SINCE IN WHICH THE SO CALLED CORBIN EFFECT IS CERTAINLY NOT PARTICULARLY WELCOME IN THE WELSH LABOUR PARTY
WE'VE HEARD THAT GLAND START ALREADY BY LEYTON ANDREWS THE BIG LOSER FROM LAST NIGHT HIM SUGGESTING YES THE LOCAL ISSUES WELSH U.K. ISSUES THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HEAD IN THE LAST WEEKS OF THE ROVER ANTI SCIMITARS AND MAY WELL HAVE BEEN A FACTOR FOR SOME VOTERS JEREMY CORBIN HAS NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACE IN THIS CAMPAIGN HE CAME OVER WE TOLD IT COME OVER ONCE A MONTH
HE APPEARS ONLY REALLY IN A VERY VERY SAFE AREAS HE'S NOT SEEN AS THEIR LEADER WITHIN WALES THAT'S KAREN HIS JOB OF COURSE AND HE WANTS TO PRESENT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF LABOUR PARTY NOT ONE SWING OVER TO THE LEFT BUT ONE THAT CAN DO DEALS WITH BUSINESS ONE WHICH WANTS TO MAINTAIN A BIT ARE SENT TO GROUND
WITHIN WALES ELGAR FELT MAYBE THERE'S BEEN A CAULDRON EFFECT IN SOME AREAS CERTAINLY BLIND WENT AS YOU MENTIONED WHERE PIKE HENRY HAVE PUSHED THEM HARD HOW GRIFFITH IN CARDIFF THANK YOU TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN TO AMERICAN POLITICS AROUND THE MOST SENIOR REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PAUL RYAN HAS SAID HE CANNOT CURRENTLY SUPPORT THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE OF THE PARTY FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DONALD TRUMP
I'M JUST NOT READY TO DO THAT AT THIS POINT I'M NOT THERE RIGHT NOW
AND I HOPED AND I WANT TO BUT I THINK WHAT IS REQUIRED IS THAT WE UNIFY THIS PARTY AND I THINK THE BALK AT THE BURDEN ON UNIFYING THE PARTY WILL HAVE TO COME FROM A PRESENT OF NOMINEE
REBECCA AS I WASH AND CORRESPONDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN TRYING TO MEND FENCES INSTEAD IT'S BECOMING QUITE CLEAR JUST HOED EVASIVE THIS PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE KID BE POLE RYAN IS THE HIGHEST RANKING ELECTED REPUBLICAN IN THE UNITED STATES HE WAS MITT ROMNEY'S RUNNING MATE IN TWENTY TWELVE
HIS NAME HAS EVEN BEEN MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY ELECTION YEAR WHISPERED BY MANY YEARS AS POSSIBLE WHITE KNIGHT AN ELECTION HAWK IF EVERYTHING CAME DOWN TO A CONTEST CONTESTED CONVENTION AND YET HE'S SEEING HE CANNOT ENDORSE THE PARTY'S PRESUMPTIVE NO LET'S BE CLEAR HE'S NOT SEEING NEVER HE'S JUST SEEING NOT YET HE SAYS THE PARTY NEEDS SOMEONE AS A STANDARD PIERRO HE WHAT'S HE WANT DONALD TRUMP TO ASPIRE TO BE THE LIKES OF HER REGAN
HE WANTS THE BILLIONAIRE NEAR TO REASSURE CONSERVATIVES HE ASPIRES TO THEIR VALUES AND HE HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF DONALD TRUMP IN THE PAST INCLUDING THEIR PROPOSAL TO BAND MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING THE U.S. BUT HE ALSO WENT ON TO SAY HE DIDN'T WANT UNDER PLAY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS ACCOMPLISHED BUT HE ALSO INHERIT SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL HE SAID
THAT'S VERY SPECIAL TO A LOT OF US SO WHO WINS THIS ARM WRESTLE THEM BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT DO YOU KNOW GEORGE BUSH AS WELL AND YOU'VE GOT WHAT JEB BUSH AND SAID VERY UNPLEASANT THINGS ABOUT LOTS OF OTHER SENIOR REPUBLICANS SAYING
I DON'T THINK HE'S THE MAN OR NOT AT THE MOMENT BUT I MEAN TO DOES HE JUST TAKE NO NOTICE DO YOU THINK IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THE PARTY HE'S MAKING NOISES THAT HE'S HELPING OTHERS AND THAT ELECTION CAMPAIGNS HE'S PLEDGED TO HELP THE PARTY RES A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION HE SAYS HE'S MADE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND A QUART OF THE HOTTEST PARTY AROUND
HE'S PUT IN PLACE A FINANCE CHAIRMAN SO HE'S TRYING TO REASSURE PARTY LEADERS AND THAT HE WANTS TO HELP ADD DOORS TRYING TO GET SENATE SEATS I WAS TRYING TO GET HIGH SEATS SOME OF HIM A VERY OPEN WE WORRIED THAT HAVING HIM AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET WILL DRAG DOWN THEIR OWN CAMPAIGNS AND WE'RE EVEN SEEING SOME U. TURNS IN A SPEECH IN WEST VIRGINIA DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WAS GETTING CALLS FROM THERE WAS AND NEVER TRUMP MOVEMENT WHO KNOW THINK HE'S O.K. AFTER ALL ONE OF THOSE IS THE FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY HE ONCE CALLED DONALD TRUMP
A CANCER ON CONSERVATISM NO HE'S BEEN OPEN TO BEING TRUMPS VICE PRESIDENT SO IT IS EARLY DAYS BUT THERE WERE STANDING THE SIDELINES WAITING FOR HIM TO CHANGE MIGHT HELP YOU OUT DO YOU SAW BUT IF WE'RE TO GET UP ON THAT STAGE WHEN HE'S ADDRESSING THESE POLITICAL RALLIES HE BASICALLY SPEAKS OFF THE CUFF NOT FROM PARTY POLICY STREETS HE'S JUST NOT GOING TO TAKE HIS CUES FROM CAPITAL HEALTH ARE TRYING TO BEND TO THEIR WILL MIGHT NOT WORK LAURA BECKHAM WASHINGTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH

WE'LL HAVE TROUBLE AGREEING TO THAT AND FACES A POTENTIALLY STORMY SESSION WHEN IT MEETS TOMORROW THE MAIN STORY FOR THE NEW DAY ON ITS LAST DAY AS A NEWSPAPER IS THE TEACHER'S UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE TO MAINTAIN THEIR SCHOOLS PLACED IN THE LEAGUE TABLES OR MASSAGING THE RESULTS OF SATS EXAMS IN RECORD NUMBERS IT IS GOVERNMENT FIGURES SHOW THAT CHEATING BY SCHOOLS IN KEY STAGE TWO SETS
WENT UP BY THIRTY TWO PERCENT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND FOURTEEN AND BY SEVENTY TWO PERCENT IN KEY STAGE ONE AMONGST EXAMPLES ARE CHEATING OR TEACHERS OPENING PAPERS EARLY AND GOING OVER QUESTIONS IN CLASS BEFORE THE TEST STARTS AND SITTING LESS ABLE PUPILS NEXT TO BRIGHT CHILDREN TO ENCOURAGE COPY
FINALLY FORECAST OF A HEAT WAVE THIS WEEKEND COME WITH A GOVERNMENT WARNING OF AIR POLLUTION ACCORDING TO THE EXPRESS THE WARM SOUTH EASTERLY WINDS THREATENED TO DRAG A THICK PLUME OF SAHARAN SMOG ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE TIME SAYS THAT PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS URGED THOSE WITH LUNG OR HEART PROBLEMS TO CONSIDER REDUCING STRENUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
IT IS A QUARTER TO SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING LABOUR SEEMS TO HAVE FARED BETTER THAN HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS IN ENGLAND AND IS EXPECTED TO HOLD ONTO POWER IN THE WELSH ASSEMBLY BUT THE PARTY'S SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN SCOTLAND WITH THE S.N.P. SAYS HE'S WON A THIRD TERM AS THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT AND THEIR PREDICTIONS THAT THE CONSERVATIVES WILL FORM THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION IN HOLYROOD
NOW THE GOVERNMENT'S TOLD THE HOUSE OF LORDS YESTERDAY THAT HE WAS WILLING TO PAUSE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE JUNIOR DOCTORS CONTRACT IN ENGLAND FOR FIVE DAYS FROM MONDAY TO ALLOW FOR TALKS JUNIOR DOCTORS HAVE REPEATEDLY BEEN ON STRIKE OVER PLANS TO IMPOSE NEW WORKING CONDITIONS HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN WHO
IN ANY LONG RUNNING INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE PASSION START TO RUN HIGH THE ON PASSOVER THE JUNIOR DOCTORS' CONTRACT IN ENGLAND HAS LED TO SOME PRETTY TORRID STANDOFF WITH THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT IN THE COMMONS RECENTLY BUT THE NEWS THAT SOME PROGRESS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE EMERGED NOT IN THE HURLY BURLY OF THE COMMONS CHAMBER BUT ON A QUIET MORNING IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS FROM THERE FRANKLY LESSER KNOWN HEALTH MINISTER LORD PRIOR OF BRAMPTON
WE ARE WILLING TO PORT INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW CONTRACT FOR FIVE DAYS FROM MONDAY SHOULD THE JUNIOR DOCTORS COMMITTEE AGREE TO FOCUS
ON THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACT MILITIAS NAMELY UNSOCIAL THEY PAY HIM HE WAS RESPONDING TO A LETTER FROM THE ACADEMY OF MEDICAL ROYAL COLLEGES WHICH HAD SUGGESTED A FIVE DAY PAWS AND HOSTILITIES ON BOTH SIDES TO ALLOW MORE TALKS TO TAKE PLACE EARLIER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAD INDICATED IT WAS NOT PREPARED TO DISCUSS THE CONTENTS OF THE CONTRACT SO LORD PRIORS SOFTLY SPOKEN ANNOUNCEMENT BUT IT WAS ON THE TABLE SEEM TO PUT LABOUR'S LADY SIMON'S WHO HAD PROMPTED THE STATEMENT SLIGHTLY OFF HER STROKE
MY LORD SIR I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I AM
WITH THE ANSWER BUT IT IS I HAVE TO SAY TO THE NEIGHBOUR LAWS RATHER MORE HOPEFUL THAN I WAS EXPECTING
SHE WENT ON TO ASK WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD DO WITH JUNIOR DOCTOR SIMPLY REFUSED TO SIGN A NEW CONTRACT LAW PRIOR KEEPING IT BRIEF AGAIN EXPLAINED HIS OWN PHILOSOPHY FOR SORTING THESE THINGS OUT
IN ALL MY EXPERIENCE IN THESE SITUATIONS IS THE LEAST LEAST SAID IN PUBLIC SOON AS BANDITS WHAT I THINK OF THE NO BLADE OF MIND I WILL NOT ANSWER HERB HOW QUESTION DIRECTLY TODAY THE PAUSE WAS WELCOME BUT TOO LATE FOR THE LIB DEMS SPOKESWOMAN LADY WALMSLEY
TRUST IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO REVISION OF MEDICAL SERVICES AND I'M SECRETARY OF STATE HAS LOST THE TRUST ALREADY
NOT ONLY OF THE JUNIOR DOCTORS BUT ALSO A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND IT HAS TO BE
THE B.M.A. HAS ALSO LOST THE TRUST OF A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE PUBLIC LORD PRIOR DEPLOYED HIS SOOTHING BEDSIDE MANNER AGAIN
ALL I WOULD SAY THAT TODAY IS THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF THE NEXT FIVE DAYS
THE B.M.A. AND THE GUN
TO FIND A RESOLUTION TO THIS AND I THINK IF WE CAN FIND A RESOLUTION
THIS ISSUE IT WILL MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SEVEN DAY WORKING ACROSS THE N.H.S. ARE MUCH
LABOUR'S SPOKESMAN LORD HUNT SAID THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT ARE DEALT WITH THE DISPUTE HAD BEEN CACK HANDED BUT COULD EVEN THE TOX AND LORD PRIORS MILD MANNER MAKE IT ALL BETTER
AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS WE ARE LEFT WITH THOUSANDS OF JUNIOR DOCTORS DISENGAGED FROM THE SERVICE BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DISPUTE AND THE ALARMIST STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THE SECT
WILL MY LORDS PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS LOOK AT HOW THE JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE TO BE BROUGHT BACK INTO THE FOLD AND GIVEN THE SUPPORT THEY SO RICHLY DESERVE
LAW PRIOR AGREED THAT THE DEEPER ISSUES NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED ONCE THE IMMEDIATE DISPUTE WAS SETTLED ONE OF THE EMINENT DOCTORS IN THE HOUSE THE INDEPENDENT LORD PATEL SAID HE WAS SURPRISED BUT DELIGHTED BY THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFER OF A PAULSON TOX I HOPE THEY'RE BOTH SIZE WILL ENTER THIS DISCUSSION IN THE SPIRIT OF FINDING A RESOLUTION
RATHER THAN FINDING FORCE IN THE DISCUSSIONS I'M SURE YOU HAVE THE TOP THE RESOLVE THE ISSUE BECAUSE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED STRIKING IS NOT THE ANSWER DO YOU DO ANYTHING
A LONG SET EXES IS DETRIMENTAL TO BE
WELL LORD PRIOR CERTAINLY MANAGED TO GET ALONG WITH THAT DOCTOR CAN I ONLY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AGREE WITH THE WORDS OF THE NOBLE
LORD RIB WERE CONSERVATIVE AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS FELT LAST WEEK'S ALL OUT STRIKES HAD REVEALED SOMETHING RATHER INTERESTING IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT THIS DISPUTE LAST WEEK A SHOW IS THAT WHEN CONSULTANTS ACTUALLY MAN THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOSPITAL
SERVICES ARE VERY MUCH BETTERS COULD I ASK MY MY NOBLE FRIEND
MY NOBLE FRIEND WOULD THEY CONSIDER HAVING AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW AFTER THIS DISPUTE TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE WORKFORCE LORD PRIOR WAS STILL KEEN TO SMOOTH FEVERED BROWS REPEATING THAT WIDER QUESTIONS WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE CURRENT DISPUTE WAS ON THE MEND
SOON HIM ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AND MORE ON THE B.B.C. READY FOR A LONG WAIT AT HALF PAST EIGHT THE TIME NOW TEN TO SEVEN SO LET US TURN TO THE ELECTIONS YESTERDAY AND WHAT HAS CHANGED HASN'T AND INDEED WHAT STAYS THE SAME JOHN CURTIS PROFESSOR OF POLITICS AT STRATHCLYDE UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN UP ALL NIGHT AS YOU WOULD EXPECT
AND JOINS US NOW JOHN IF WE COULD START WITH WITH SCOTLAND HOW WE SING FOR CERTAIN NOW THAT THE CONSERVATIVES ARE GOING TO BE THE MAIN OPPOSITION IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT WELL WE'RE NOT QUITE SAYING FOR SCOTLAND JUSTIN BUT CERTAINLY ALL THE ROOMS SO FAR OF THE EVIDENCE THAT'S COME IN AND CRUCIALLY IT'S THE LISTS VOTES THERE COMING IS THAT SECOND VOTE WHICH FOR THE MOST PART IS GOING TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF SEATS ARE BOTH CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR
ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE CONSERVATIVES ARE COMFORTABLY AHEAD OF LABOUR ON THAT CRUCIAL VOTE AND THEREFORE WILL BE THE SECOND LARGEST PARTY IN THE SECOND NOT ARGUE PER CENT CERTAIN BUT YOU KNOW NINETEEN NINETY FIVE PERCENT AND ON ENGLAND THE PICTURE FOR LABOUR WELL I MEAN BETTER REALLY MORE MIXED I THINK JOHNNY CORBIN IN A SENSE IS GOING TO BE IN A SENSE IT SAVED BY THE VET THE EXPECTATIONS THAT WERE SET FOR AN ADVANCE
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF COMMENTATORS WERE SAYING LABOUR COULD EXPECT TO LOSE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEATS GIVEN THEIR STANDING IN THE OPINION POLLS WELL ACTUALLY SO FAR THEY'VE NOT LOST MUCH MORE THAN A COUPLE OF DOZEN MANY OF THE COUNCILS THAT WERE ON PEOPLE'S NESTERS PLACES LABOUR COULD LOSE LIKE SOUTHAMPTON CRAWLEY AND REDDITCH THEY HAVEN'T
WHY TWO REASONS ONE IS THAT LABOUR'S ADVANCE IN THESE LOCAL ACTION SINCE THE LOCAL ELECTIONS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT STRONGER THAN EXPECT FOR THE OPINION POLLS AND THE CIRCUIT IS A LOOKS SO THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAS PERHAPS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING HAD A PARTICULAR PROBLEM IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND WHERE IT'S VOTES FOR MORE HEAVILY AND WAY OF COURSE LABOUR'S MORE VULNERABLE COUNCILS THAT ARE ACTUALLY LOCATED BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR SHARE OF THE VOTE CAN YOU SAY COULD COULD ALLOW A LABOUR OPTIMISTS SAY CORBIN SUPPORTER SAY
THIS SEEMS TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE FROM WHICH TO RISE UP AND FIGHT THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION WITH A CHANCE OF WINNING WELL ACCORDION SUPPORTED COULD SAY IT'S A BETTER PLACE AND WHERE THE PARTY WAS TWELVE MONTHS AGO BUT IN TRUTH I'M NOT SURE A CAULDRON SUPPORTED COULD EVEN CLAIMED THAT THE PARTY'S POSITION WAS CLEARLY BETTER THAN THE ONE ACHIEVED BY ED MILIBAND TWELVE MONTHS INTO HIS LEADERSHIP BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN
WHICH AT THE TIME WAS REGARDED AS A VERY MODEST PERFORMANCE AND CERTAINLY IF WE BEAR IN MIND THAT OPPOSITIONS THAT APPEAR TO BE WELL ON COURSE FOR VICTORY USUALLY END UP WITH DOUBLE DIGIT NEEDS IN TERMS OF THE ESTIMATED NATIONAL VOTE LABOUR ARE NOWHERE NEAR THAT SO IT COULD MENTAL PROGRESS JUSTIN BUT I'M SURE THEY'LL STILL BE A LOT OF DISPUTE AN ARGUMENT IN THE PARTY
ABOUT WHETHER THE INCREMENT THAT THEY'VE ACHIEVED IS IN FOR ADEQUATE AND CERTAINLY WHETHER IT'S AN INDICATION OF THE KIND OF PROGRESS THAT THE PARTY NEEDS TO LOOK AS THOUGH I MIGHT WHEN IN TWENTY TWELVE AND IS THAT THE STORY WHEN YOU ADD IN WHAT'S HAPPENED IN WALES WITH WORK WELL IS ONE REALLY SIGNIFICANT LOSS FOR LABOUR THERE IS IS THE STORY SUCH A MIXED BAG THAT EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OUT OF IT WHAT THEY WANT AND WE ARE IN TERMS OF PROGRESS TOWARDS SETTLING ANY ARGUMENTS NOWHERE WHY THEY'VE BEEN SO DON'T TRY TO SURPRISE US BUT
THE TRUTH IS IN SCOTLAND IT'S PROBABLY WORSE THAN LABOUR COULD HAVE HOPED FOR IN WALES IT SIMPLY AS BAD AS THE PARTY COULD HOPE FOR IS JUST SO HAPPENS THAT IN ENGLAND IT'S A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN PERHAPS THE PARTY COULD HOPE FOR BUT IN TRUTH NONE OF THESE PERFORMANCES ARE PARTICULARLY GOOD AND GIVEN THAT THE PARTY IS A PARTY NOW GONE BACK EVEN FURTHER IN SCOTLAND GIVEN THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR LABOUR TO WIN A GENERAL ACTION WITHOUT RECLAIMING SCOTLAND
A MODEST ACHIEVEMENT IN ENGLAND LOOKS VERY MODEST INDEED AGAINST THAT CHALLENGE JOHN CURTIS PROFESSOR OF POLITICS AT STRATHCLYDE UNIVERSITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THEY'VE BEEN FEW REASONS FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS TO CHEER RECENTLY BUT THEY'VE HAD WARM OR TWO RESULTS TO MAKE THEM SMILE PARTICULARLY IN SCOTLAND WERE JOIN ON MALIGNED BY NORMAN LAMB THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M.P. RED AUDIENCE TIM FARRON MORN IF YOU WAS A HEALTH MINISTER IN THE COALITION THOSE RESULTS IN SCOTLAND IN PARTICULAR CHEERING YOU PRESUME
IT'S REALLY ENCOURAGING IN TWO CONSTITUENCIES WE'VE GAINED SEATS FOR THE SCOTTISH NATIONALISTS AND YOU'D NEVER HAVE IMAGINED THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE A FEW MONTHS AGO SO THAT'S REALLY ENCOURAGING AND I THINK OUR VOTE SHARE IS UP IN SCOTLAND AS WELL
BUT THE BATTLE YOU NEED AGAINST THE TORIES THE BADLY NEED TO WIN AGAINST THE TORIES IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND BIT OF PROGRESS BUT NOTHING THAT'S GOING TO GET YOU VERY CLOSE TO THE SORT OF LEVELS YOU USED TO ENJOY IT NO LOOK WE SUFFERED A KNOCK OUT BLOW LAST YEAR YOU'VE GOT A LIST AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO GET BACK FROM THAT AND BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THE REBUILDING
IS UNDER WAY INCIDENTALLY KIRSTY WILLIAMS IN WALES WON A FANTASTIC SHARE THE VOTE OVER FIFTY PER CENT IN THE SEAT THAT WE LOST TO THE TORIES IN WALES LAST YEAR IN THE GENERAL ELECTION SO THAT'S SHOWING THAT WE CAN GAIN AGAINST THE TORIES AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE MODEST RESULTS YES BUT SMALL NET GAINS ACROSS ENGLAND
VERY ENCOURAGING IT SCOTLAND SO I THINK OVERALL WE'RE VERY VERY FAR FROM COMPLACENT WE REALISE THIS IS A MOUNTAIN WE'VE GOT TO CLIMB BUT I THINK THE FIGHT BACK HAS STARTED NOW MENTION YOU WERE A HEALTH MINISTER IN THE COALITION YOU'VE BEEN ONE OF THOSE CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT YOUR OLD BOSS JEREMY HUNT TO GO INTO TALKS DO YOU TAKE HIS OFFER TO DO THAT AS SINCERE OR DO YOU THINK THIS IS MERELY A POLITICAL RUSE SO IT DOESN'T LOOK AS IF THE GOVERNMENT OF BEING INTRANSIGENT
WELL TIME WILL TELL PARTICULARLY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS I JUST DESPERATELY HOPE THAT IT IS SERIOUS BECAUSE THIS ONGOING DISPUTE IS INCREDIBLY DAMAGING TO THE N.H.S. THE MORALE
DOCTORS IS ROCK BOTTOM THERE WILL BE AN IMPACT ON PATIENTS THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT ALL TERMS THE SURGE OF STATE SEEMS IT'S THE CONTRACT STUPID IN OTHER WORDS LARGELY ABOUT PAYMENTS FOR SATURDAY AND OUT OF HOURS WORKING WHERE'S THE B.M.A. SEEM TO BE SAYING WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT DEMORALISING DOCTORS FROM WORK LOAD TO PAY TO THE CASH THAT GOES INTO THE HEALTH SERVICE LOOK AT I THINK THAT WIDER DISCUSSION IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY I'VE CALLED FOR A CROSS PARTY COMMISSION
TO SIT AS A MATTER OF URGENCY TO COME UP WITH A NEW LONG TERM SETTLEMENT BECAUSE I THINK THE JUNIOR DOCTORS' STRIKE ULTIMATELY IS JUST THE LATEST MANIFESTATION OF A SYSTEM UNDER IMPOSSIBLE STRAIN AND THE FINANCES OF THE N.H.S. WITH US PROJECTED TO SPEND OR REDUCING PERCENTAGE OF OUR NATIONAL INCOME FOR GOODNESS SAKE BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY GIVEN
SIGNIFICANTLY RISING DEMAND YOU CANNOT SUSTAIN THIS WHAT THIS DISPUTE IS ABOUT IS THE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO STRETCH AND OVERSTRETCHED RESOURCE EVEN FURTHER AND THAT'S WHY JUNIOR DOCTORS ALSO UNHAPPY WITH US

GOOD MORNING IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE SIXTH OF MAY THE HEADLINES THE S.N.P. SAYS IT'S MADE HISTORY BY WINNING A THIRD OF SCOTTISH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IN A ROW THE CONSERVATIVES ARE CONFIDENT OF REPLACING LABOUR AS THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
LABOUR'S PERFORMANCE IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS IN ENGLAND HAS BEEN BETTER THAN SOME HAD PREDICTED BUT SOME M.P.S HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED UNHAPPINESS AT THE RESULTS IN WALES LABOUR ON COURSE TO REMAIN IN POWER WAS THE U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY SAY THEY'RE HOPING TO WIN UP TO FIVE SEATS IN THE ASSEMBLY THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY DIANA SPEED
THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY HAVE CLAIMED VICTORY IN ELECTIONS TO THE PARLIAMENT IN EDINBURGH THEY HAVE GAINED ABOUT A DOZEN CONSTITUENCY SEEDS FROM LABOUR PARTY WHICH ONCE DOMINATED SCOTTISH POLITICS THAT IS NOW SET TO COME THIRD BEHIND THE CONSERVATIVES
IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS AND ENGLAND LABOUR HAVE PERFORMED BETTER THAN MANY PREDICTED RETAINING CONTROL OF COUNCILS REGARDED AS VULNERABLE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE CANCER RESULTS AND OWEN THEY'VE ALSO WON TWO WESTMINSTER BY ELECTIONS HOLDING ONTO ENCORE IN SOUTH WALES AND SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE AND HILLSBOROUGH ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE NIGHT'S EVENTS
A NIGHT OF LITTLE CHANGE BUT THAT IN ITSELF TELLS ITS OWN STORY FOR JEREMY CORBIN RELIEF AND RESULTS THERE DO NOT SEEM TO GIVE HIS CRITICS THE TRIGGER THEY SOUGHT TO CHALLENGE HIS LEADERSHIP BY AND LARGE THE PARTY HELD ITS GROUND AND CRUCIALLY RETAINED COUNCILS IN THE SOUTH AND MIDLANDS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN VULNERABLE SUCH AS CRAWLEY SOUTHAMPTON AND REDDITCH
IT WON THE SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE BY ELECTION COMFORTABLY AND OVERALL LABOUR'S SHARE OF THE VOTE IS UP FOUR PERCENT ON LAST YEAR THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL IF YOU COMPARE FROM WHEN JEREMY TOOK OVER TO NOW WE'RE ON A CLEAR PATH OF IMPROVEMENT
NOTHING MORE THAN THAT I DON'T EXAGGERATE IT I DON'T WANT TO OVER EMPHASISE I'M JUST SAYING THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT OUR STRATEGY IS ALL ABOUT IT IS THOUGH THE FIRST TIME ANY LABOUR LEADER IN RECENT HISTORY HAS FAILED TO WIN SEATS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR EVEN MICHAEL FOOT GAINED NEARLY A THOUSAND AND IN SCOTLAND WHICH MISTER CORBIN SAID WOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR HIM THE PARTY'S RESULT
PUSHED INTO THIRD PLACE WAS DESCRIBED BY ONE CRITIC AS CATACLYSMIC UNTHINKABLE THE LABOUR M.P. JOE COX I THINK IT'S BEEN A VERY WEAK NIGHT FOR LABOUR AND THIS IS NOT A ROUTE BACK TO POWER IN TWENTY TWENTY AND YOU KNOW AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THIS MORNING I THINK JEREMY
AND THE LEADERSHIP NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT'S BEEN A POOR NIGHT FOR US FOR THE CONSERVATIVES SURPRISE AND SOME SATISFACTION THAT WITH ME HER CIVIL WAR OVER EUROPE AND DISARRAY OVER THE BUDGET THE PARTY HAS ONLY LOST ONE COUNCIL WORCESTER AND ACHIEVED A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE IN SCOTLAND AFTER YEARS IN THE POLITICAL WILDERNESS THE CONSERVATIVE CABINET MINISTER CHRIS GRAYLING
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND GOVERNMENTS HAD A VERY SOLID SET OF THE COUNCIL RESULTS HAS GAINED GROUND IN SCOTLAND RE ESTABLISHED POSITION IN SCOTLAND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS MEANWHILE AFTER YEARS OF CRUSHING REVERSES LOOKED TO HAVE HALTED THEIR REMORSELESS DOWNWARDS SPIRAL GAINING A CLUTCH OF COUNSELLORS WHILE UKIP WHO AGAIN COME SECOND IN MANY TRADITIONAL LABOUR SEATS ARE AND CALLS TO GAIN AROUND FORTY COUNSELLORS AND SECURE A REPRESENTATION ON THE WELSH ASSEMBLY FOR THE FIRST TIME
SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON'S SAID THE S.N.P. IS RE ELECTION WAS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN ITS RECORD IN GOVERNMENT HOWEVER THE GNASHER'S LOST A HANDFUL OF SEEDS TO THE CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WITH JUST TWO CONSTITUENCY RESULTS TO COME TURN OUT IN SCOTLAND IS PUT AT FIFTY FIVE PER CENT ABOUT FIVE POINTS HIGHER THAN LAST TIME HE'S A SCOT SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT COLIN BLANE
THE S.N.P. CAME INTO THIS CAMPAIGN ON THE BACK OF TWO REMARKABLE RESULTS THEY'RE LANDSLIDE IN LAST YEAR'S GENERAL ELECTION AND THEY'RE STUNNING MAJORITY VICTORY IN THE PREVIOUS HOLYROOD ELECTION IN TWENTY ELEVEN THEY ARE HEADING FOR A WIN THIS TIME TOO BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THEY WON'T MANAGE ANOTHER OUTRIGHT MAJORITY
THEY MADE FRESH GAINS AT SCOTTISH LABOUR'S EXPENSE CAPTURING SEATS LIKE MOTHERWELL AND WISHAW AND GREEN LOOK AT INVERCLYDE THIS WAS HOW THE S.N.P. LEADER NICOLA STURGEON DECLARED VICTORY
WHAT IS NO BEYOND DATE IS AT THE S. P. HAS WON I THOUGHT CONSECUTIVE
SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ELECTION THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE GODDESS
LABOUR LOST THIRTEEN SEATS MOST TO THE S. N. P. BUT THE CONTINUING COLLAPSE BENEFITED THE CONSERVATIVES TOO
THE SCOTTISH TORIES TOOK EASTWOOD AND THEM FISHER FROM LABOUR BUT THEY WON SEATS FOR ME S. M. P. AS WELL CAPPED BY RUTH DAVIDSON'S VICTORY AND EDINBURGH CENTRAL
THE PEOPLE WANT US TO DO A VERY SPECIFIC JOB AND IT'S A JOB THAT ME AND MY TEAM OF M.S.P.S ARE COMING IN TAKE EXCEPTIONALLY SERIOUSLY AND THAT IS TO HAUL THE S.N.P. TO ACCOUNT TO HAVE THE SORT OF LEVEL OF CHALLENGE AND SCRUTINY OF DEBATE IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT WE'VE NOT SEEN IN THE LAST NINE YEARS AND I THINK THAT'S A JOB THAT WE CAN DO
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER WILLIE RENNIE WON A SEAT FROM THE S. AND P.
SOME OF THE REGIONAL LIST VOTE WHICH DETERMINE NEARLY HALF OF HOLLYWOOD'S M.S.P.S HAVE STILL TO COME IN
UKIP'S SAY THEY'RE HOPEFUL OF WINNING AT LEAST FIVE SEATS IN THE WELSH ASSEMBLY LABOUR ARE EXPECTED TO HOLD ON TO THAT THEY SUFFERED A SHOCK DEFEAT IN RONDA TO THE PLIED COME LEADER LEANNE WOOD MARK HUTCHINGS REPORTS FROM THE COUNT IN CARDIFF
WELSH LABOUR SUFFERED ONE MAJOR CASUALTY THEY'D HAVE COMFORTABLY SECURED THEIR POSITION AS THE ASSEMBLY'S BIGGEST PARTY READY TO FORM THE NEXT GOVERNMENT WITH OR WITHOUT HELP TO GET A MAJORITY THE ONLY SIGNS WERE GOOD FOR LABOUR PICKING UP SUFFICIENT VOTES INKY SEATS HOLDING OFF THE CHALLENGE FROM THE TORIES IN PARTICULAR WREXHAM VALE OF CLWYD DOWN AND GET OUT
THEN CAME THE BIG SHOCK GOVERNMENT MINISTER LADEN ANDREW'S LOSING HIS HONDA VALLEYS SEATS TO PRIDE LEADER LEANNE WOOD GIVE A FEW OTHER TRIUMPHS FOR HER PARTY BUT THIS WAS A HUGE PERSONAL VICTORY
A NEW DAWN IS ABOUT TO BREAK IN WE'RE IN THE WRONG A NEW DAWN HAS ALREADY BROKEN OVER THE VALLEYS PEOPLE HAVE VOTED FOR CHANGE
ANOTHER THE LIB DEMS KIRSTY WILLIAMS ALSO FARED WELL INCREASING HER MAJORITY IN BRECON AND RABBIT SHOW BUT IT WAS BITTER SWEET THE LIB DEMS HAVE JUST MISSED OUT ON THEIR TARGET IN CARDIFF CENTRAL AND KIRSTY WILLIAMS MAIN LATER THIS MORNING FINE SHE HAS ONE OR NO LIB DEM COLLEAGUES TO KEEP HER COMPANY UKIP'S MOMENT HASN'T YET COME THE REGIONAL SEATS WILL DETERMINE HOW BIG THEIR PRESENCE WILL BE THEY WOULD NO DOUBT CHANGE THE FLAVOUR OF THE NEW ASSEMBLY WHICH IS SURE TO BE HEADED BY A FAMILIAR LOOKING GOVERNMENT
JOE ANDERSON HAS BEEN RE ELECTED AS THE MAYOR OF LIVERPOOL FOR LABOUR THE OUTCOME OF THE MAYORAL CONTESTS IN LONDON SALFORD AND BRISTOL WON'T BE KNOWN UNTIL LATER ON COUNTING IS YET TO BEGIN IN THE ELECTION FOR THE NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY WITH HER ASSESSMENT OF THE RESULTS SO FAR AND WHAT THEY'LL TELL US ABOUT THE POLITICAL CLIMATE ACROSS THE U.K. HE'S A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA CAN SPOOK
WHEN WE VOTES WE HAVE OUR SAY AND POLITICIANS HAVE TO LISTEN THE RESULTS AREN'T YET COMPLETE BUT PLENTY OF THE MESSAGES FROM US TO THEM ARE CLEAR
JEREMY CORBIN'S PARTY HAS SWERVED UNIVERSAL THERE'S DISASTER LOSSES SO FAR IN ENGLAND OUR FEWER THAN SOME HAD FEARED BUT WITH MELT DOWN IN SCOTLAND AND LOSSES WHERE THEY SHOULD TRADITIONALLY BE GAINS LABOUR WOULD BE FOOLISH TO TAKE MUCH COMFORT FROM THE RESULTS THERE'S A LITTLE SIR SUGGEST VOTERS BELIEVE IT'S ON ITS WAY TO GENERAL ELECTION VICTORY
NOR IS THERE MUCH EVIDENCE OF ENTHUSIASM FOR THE TORIES IN ENGLAND THEY'VE SO FAR PICKED UP A HANDFUL OF SEATS TRADITIONALLY AN ACHIEVEMENT FOR A PARTY IN POWER AT THESE KINDS OF POLES BUT FOR SUCCESS AND UNEXPECTED SUCCESS THEY HAVE TO LOOK TO SCOTLAND WHERE IT APPEARS THEY ARE SET TO TAKE SECOND PLACE A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE BUT THERE AGAIN VOTERS EXPRESS THEIR FAITH AND BELIEF IN THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY
IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS VOTERS DECISIONS HAVE ENDED SOME POLITICAL CAREERS AND STARTED OTHERS MANY HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUAL SEATS OF CHANGE HANDS THERE ARE MANY COUNTS NOT YET COMPLETE THIS IS A PICTURE IN FLUX
BUT LABOUR IS SEEMING TO KLINGON RATHER THAN TO MAKE PROGRESS THE TRAVAILS OF GOVERNMENT DON'T SEEM TO TROUBLE THE TORY VOTE TOO MUCH PERHAPS VOTERS BIG MESSAGE TO OUR POLITICIANS IS AS YOU WERE
ANOTHER STORY THE BOMBING OF A REFUGEE CAMP IN SYRIA HAS BEEN WIDELY CONDEMNED WITH THE UNITED NATIONS SAYING IT COULD AMOUNT TO A WAR CRIME AT LEAST THIRTY PEOPLE ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN YESTERDAY'S AIR STRIKES YEAH SOMEONE IN THE PROVINCE WHICH LOCAL PEOPLE ARE BLAMING ON THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HELEN SAYS THE ATTACK SHOW THAT THERE ARE IN HIS WORDS NO DEPTHS TO WHICH THE REGIME WILL NOT SINK
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE BIGGEST ELECTION STORY SO FAR AT LEAST COMES FROM SCOTLAND IT'S NO SURPRISE THEY'RE NO LESS SIGNIFICANT FOR THAT THE COUNTRY WILL BE GOVERNED AGAIN BY THE S.N.P. AND THE NICOLA STURGEON HAS SECURED HER OWN MANDATE AS FIRST MINISTER WAS HAM BELOW THOSE HEADLINES IS PRETTY DRAMATIC THE PARTY'S NOT SWEPT THE BOARD AS WIDELY PREDICTED THE TORIES LOOK SET TO BECOME THE MAIN OPPOSITION PUSHING LABOUR INTO THIRD PLACE
EVEN THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE SOME SURPRISE GAMES JIM KNOCKED HAVE BEEN WATCHING IT ALL FROM GLASGOW OVERNIGHT AND JOINS US NOW THERE IS A SENSE JIM ISN'T THERE PARTICULARLY IF THE TORIES ARE CONFIRMED AS THE OPPOSITION THIS IS ANOTHER DRAMATIC CHANGE IN SCOTTISH POLITICS IT'S REMARKABLE NICK I MEAN RUTH DAVIDSON THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER HAS RUN A VERY PERKY CAMPAIGNERS WE'VE ALL BEEN REPORTING OR OVER THE WEEKS SHE'S A FORMIDABLE PERFORMER AND IT HAS PAID OFF IT LOOKS WE'VE GOT
FIVE OF THE REGIONAL LISTS STILL TO BE DECLARED SO THERE'S A LITTLE WAY TO GO AND WE CAN'T BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THIS ON TWO FRONTS ONE HAVE
THE TORIES ARE GOING TO BE AHEAD OF LABOUR IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THEY WILL AND SECONDLY WHETHER THE S.N.P. WILL HAVE AN OVERALL MAJORITY THE SYSTEM IN A WAY IT WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THAT REMEMBERED ME THE WAY THEY DID IT IN TWENTY ELEVEN WITH REMARKABLE THEY MAY NEED THE GREEN SORT OF FULL GREENS AT THE MOMENT IN THERE TO DO SOME SORT OF DEAL TO GET AN ABSOLUTE WORKING MAJORITY BUT THEY'RE IN POWER YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE BUT
THE IDEA THAT THE LABOUR PARTY IN SCOTLAND SHOULD BE REMOVED AS THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION AND REPLACE
BY THE CONSERVATIVES AT LED BY RUTH DAVIDSON DAY AFTER DAY CHALLENGE NICOLA STURGEON IN HOLYROOD IS AN EARTHQUAKE I IT REALLY IS A LABOUR WERE WIPED OUT IN GLASGOW OVERNIGHT NOT A SINGLE SEAT IN THE CITY THEY'VE BEEN WIPED OUT IN FIFE
THEY'VE GOT SOME LITTLE PATCHES OF PROGRESS THEY WANT EDWARD OF SOUTHERN WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PARLIAMENTARY SEAT AS THEY HOLD AT WESTMINSTER WITH THE MONEY YOUNG CANDIDATE CALLED DANIEL JOHNSON AND THAT WAS
A SORT OF HAPPY MOMENT FOR THEM THE REST OF IT WAS GRIM IAN MONEY HIMSELF I THINK CALLED THAT CATACLYSMIC IN GLASGOW AND KEZIA DUGDALE THE LEADER HAS BEEN SAYING IN THE LAST HOUR WELL NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I REMAIN AS LEADER THE KIND OF STATEMENT THAT YOU KNOW INDICATE IT'S BEEN A NIGHT OF HORROR
FOR A PARTY WHAT'S FASCINATING IS RATHER LIKE THE TORIES WHO HAD THAT MASSIVE LONG TERM DECLINE FROM IN THE BIGGEST PARTY IN SCOTLAND IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES IT SEEMS AS IF LABOUR HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING THEY TRY A NEW LEADER THEY TRY SHIFTING POLICY ON TRIED AND THEY SHIFT ON TAX OF COURSE THEY'VE GOT A NEW LEADER IN THE U.K. AND JEREMY CORE AND MUCH MORE LEFT WING THAN WHAT WENT BEFORE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT'S LEFT TO TRY IS IT WELL I THINK THAT'S RIGHT COME IN HER DOWN ABOUT NINE PER CENT IN THE CONSTITUENCY VOTE SEVENTY THREE SEATS DONE THE FIRST PAST THE POST THE OTHERS ON THE
PIA TOP UP ADDITIONAL MEMBER SYSTEM DEVISED BY A FRIEND MY AUNT WHICH I WOULD TRY AND EXPLAIN TEA BUT IT WORKS ANYWAY YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN THEY'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING THOUGH A COUPLE OF THE CANDIDATES WILL BE SPEAKING TO IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS WERE INDICATING THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT
THEY BOTH LOST BY THE WAY THEY THOUGHT THAT
WHAT THE PARTY NEEDED TO DO AFTER THE COMING STORM WHICH THEY QUITE RIGHTLY FORESAW WAS REALLY TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE FACT THAT
THEY REALLY HAVEN'T GRAPPLED WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION PROPERLY AND PEOPLE DON'T QUITE KNOW WHERE THEY STAND THEY ARE ARGUING FOR A SORT OF FEDERAL BRITAIN IN THE WAY THAT GORDON BROWN LEAD OUT ABOUT BOOK LAST YEAR WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHAT IS THE PARTY STANDING FOR IN A WAY IT'S A MEDAL BUT BUT THROUGH THAT CONSTITUTIONAL ENDS OF THE PROBLEM THAT FACED ED MILIBAND'S PARTY WHAT DO YOU STAND FOR AT THE ELECTION IF WE VOTE FOR YOU WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY DO WE GET
IT'S THAT SORT OF FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT THEY CLEARLY HAVEN'T SOLVED AND THE S.N.P. ALTHOUGH YOU MAYBE LIAM AN ODDITY ADMINISTRATION IN THE END IS STILL RULING THE ROOST ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT TRIUMPHANT AND NOW YOU'VE GOT THIS RESURGENT CONSERVATIVE VOTE RUTH DAVIDSON SAID LOOK IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE NATIONALIST ON INDEPENDENCE AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT FIFTY FOUR PER CENT OF THE POPULATION DID IN THE REFERENDUM
YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE CONSERVATIVE AND IT'S QUITE CLEAR FROM THE RESULTS THAT IN A LOT OF RURAL AREAS FOR EXAMPLE TO A CONSERVATIVE AREAS OVER THE GENERATIONS PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK AND VOTING CONSERVATIVE JIM FOR A BETTER OPPOSITION AS RUTH DAVIDSON CLAIMED IT WOULD BE I THINK SHE'LL BE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION AND IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE NICK AND SCOTTISH POLITICS JIM NAUGHTIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL GET YOU TO RECORD AN EXPLANATION OF THE HORN FORMING AND PUT IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA
NO CRASH THE INTERNET THIRTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN LET'S GET A PICTURE NOW THE WAY ENGLISH COUNCILS LOOK THIS MORNING ABOUT THE BOAT YESTERDAY SHOWS ABOUT THE STATE OF SUPPORT FOR THE MAIN PARTIES TOM BATEMAN HAS A REPORT FROM CRAWLEY IN WEST SUSSEX WHERE LABOUR WERE THREATENED WITH LOSING CONTROL OF THE DISTRICT COUNCIL IN THE EVENT HELD ON IN FACT THEY DID RATHER BETTER THAN THAT
THIS IS A PLACE USED TO NOISE WE ARE A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD FROM GATWICK AIRPORT
AND IT'S BEEN LABOUR IN CRAWLEY ADDING THERE CHEERS TO THE SOUNDS THAT ROUND HERE THIS COUNCIL WAS AMONG THE PARTY'S MOST VULNERABLE IN ENGLAND WITH A MAJORITY OF JUST ONE BUT LABOUR DEFIED EXPECTATIONS TO HOLD THE COUNCIL AND EVEN GAIN A SEAT WE WERE AT THE COUNTER THE SPORTS CENTRE HERE OVERNIGHT AS THE RESULTS CAME IN FROM ELSEWHERE
SUGGESTING THAT LABOUR MAY BE IN FOR A BETTER NIGHT THAN IT HAD FEARED CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE
I'M READY TO DECLARE THE RESULT FOR WASTE IT'S WAR HAD THE RESULTS BEGAN ROLLING IN SHORTLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT IN LABOUR'S COUNCIL LEADER OR NEWCASTLE HELD ON TO HIS SEAT WITH A SLIGHTLY INCREASED MAJORITY NICK FORBES ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
IT'S JUST GONE MIDNIGHT HERE AT THE CELTIC CRAWLEY
ROWS AND ROWS OF TRESTLE TABLES ARE STRETCHING ALMOST AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE IN THE SPORTS HALL HENRY SMITH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT CHRONIC CONSTITUENCY THE LOCAL M.P. WAS HERE PERHAPS HE'D HOPED TO ADD HIS WEIGHT TO CONSERVATIVE CELEBRATIONS BUT THIS WAS A MAN AT ONE IN THE MORNING HARDLY OOZING CONFIDENCE WELL WE HOPE TO GAIN CONTROL TONIGHT BUT OF COURSE TRADITIONALLY THE ELECTORATE LIKE TO SEND MESSAGES
LOCAL ELECTIONS AND BY ELECTIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF PARLIAMENTS IT'S COMING UP TO TWO A.M. NOW AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT LABOUR ARE APPEARING INCREASINGLY UP BEAT AND I DO HEREBY DECLARE THAT MICHAEL WILLIAM PICKETT IS DULY ELECTED AS THE COUNSELLOR FOR SOUTHGATE
LABOUR GAIN DECEIT MEAN THEY MAINTAINED CONTROL OF THE COUNCIL MY NAME IS IT'S LAMB AND I'M THE LEADER OF OUR COUNCIL PRETTY RELIEVES ALL IN ALL
IT WASN'T A RESULT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE PREDICTED GAINING A SCENE THAT CERTAINLY IT'S GONE BEYOND OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE YOU GOING TO SAY THAT YOU'VE DONE THIS BECAUSE OF LOCAL ISSUES BUT YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE ALSO VOTE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY SEE THE PARTY HAVE YOU DONE THIS BECAUSE OF OR IN SPITE OF JEREMY
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE LEAD WE HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT NOW HE HAS A MAJORITY AS HER RIGHTS PUT HIS FEAST PUBLICAN SIT TESTED BEFORE ELECTORATES ULTIMATELY WE HAVEN'T FELT NECESSARILY THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE LEEDS TEAM WORK BEST PLACED TO PROVIDE SPORT THAT WE NEEDED TO HIT HIS
CERTAINLY SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM SEAMUS MILNE YESTERDAY AROUND WITH OR NOT WE WERE GOING TO LUCY'S AGAIN SEATS DIDN'T EXACTLY PROVIDE CONFIDENCE THAT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR OR SO HE'S BEING PAID HIS MONEY WELL SPENT BY THE PARTY
WHEN WE CAN'T AFFORD ORGANISERS FORCE IT'S LIKE CALLING THE STORY SO FAR OF THE NIGHT IN ENGLAND HAS BEEN EXPECTATIONS OF BIG PROBLEMS FOR LABOUR FAILING TO MATERIALISE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE LOST SEATS AND LOST THE COUNCIL DUDLEY MUCH OF THE PRESSURE ON THE PARTY IN PART OF ITS OWN MAKING PARTICULARLY FROM M. PEAS UNFAVOURABLE TO JEREMY CORBIN WAS ABOUT HOW YOU MEASURED SUCCESS AND FAILURE IN THESE LOCAL ELECTIONS
IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING THE PARTY'S SO CALLED LINES TO TAKE DOCUMENT WAS LEAKED THE EMAIL STEERING SPOKESPEOPLE TO SAY THAT THE MEASURE OF SUCCESS WAS A COMPARISON TO LABOUR'S SHARE OF THE VOTE AT LAST YEAR'S GENERAL ELECTION RATHER THAN WHEN THESE COUNCIL SEATS WERE LAST UP FOR GRABS FOUR YEARS AGO THE LEEKS LINES WERE PUT TO THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL I THINK I WROTE THEM NOT EXCUSES WHAT MY COMPARATOR IS IS HOW FAR
ON JEREMY CORBEL HAVE WHAT HAVE WE COME SINCE THE LAST GENERAL ELECTION AND SINCE HE WAS ELECTED IF WE'RE NOW GAINING ON THAT IT'S PROGRESS FOR US I THINK WE'RE ON COURSE WE'RE LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR A FOUR YEAR PROGRAM THE CONSERVATIVES LOST OVERALL CONTROL IN WORCESTER BUT SECURED A MAJORITY IN PETERBOROUGH THE TORY VOTE APPEAR TO BE DOWN IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND
WHICH MAY HAVE HELPED LABOUR RETAIN CONTROL OF AREAS LIKE HERE IN CRAWLEY IN SOUTHAMPTON NORWICH AND HASTINGS THE CONSERVATIVES FACED ACCUSATIONS OVERNIGHT THAT THEY FAILED TO CAPITALISE ON LABOUR'S RECENT PROBLEMS YOU'VE LOST THE SEAT HERE IT'S ALWAYS DISAPPOINTING TO LOSE A C. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO REVIEW IT IN THE CONTEXT THAT WE ARE A YEAR IN A MAJORITY CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS THIS HASN'T BEEN A BRILLIANT NIGHT IN CRAWLEY FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY BIRDS
EQUALLY I THINK LABOUR'S MODEST GAIN OF ONE SEATS THEY SHOULD BE DOING A LOT BETTER AT THIS STAGE IN THE PARLIAMENT THE LIB DEMS GAINED SEVEN SEATS AND YOU COULD GAIN SEATS IN THURROCK TAMWORTH IN BOLTON AND ON THE NORFOLK COAST I SEE YOU'RE NOT THAT MEAN HIGH TIME ON TRYING TO BE O.K.
HERE IN CRAWLEY LABOUR WERE LOOKING FOR PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES I COUNT THEY STILL HOLD THIS COUNCIL NOW BY THE THINNEST OF MARGINS FOR NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN ENOUGH
TOM BAKER REPORTING FROM CRAWLEY ANNA REYNOLDS THE LABOUR M.P. FOR WOLVERHAMPTON NORTH EAST IS FORMER SHADOW HOUSING MINISTER SHE RESIGN FROM THE SHADOW CABINET WHEN JERRY CALLING BECAME LEADER AND SHE'S ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DO YOU THINK JOHN MACDONALD WAS RIGHT RUN UP CLAIRE PATH OF IMPROVEMENT WE'RE ON COURSES
WELL I THINK WE HAVE DONE WELL IN SOME AREAS IN WOLVERHAMPTON IN MY OWN CONSTITUENCY WE DID WELL YOU'VE HEARD THEY'RE IN THE CLIP IN CRAWLEY TOO BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE CONTENT WITH EITHER STANDING STILL GOING BACKWARDS IN OTHER AREAS KEY BATTLEGROUNDS WE'VE LOST CONTROL OF DUDLEY WE LOST COUNCILLORS IN NUNEATON BERRY TAMWORTH NORTH EAST LINCOLNSHIRE AND OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD SOME VERY TROUBLING HER DISAPPOINTING RESULTS IN
SCOTLAND I THINK IT'S CLEAR NOW THAT WILL BE THE TORIES IN DISARRAY AND SIX YEARS OF TORY GOVERNMENT WE SHOULD BE MAKING SIGNIFICANT GAINS AT LOCAL ELECTIONS IN AT THIS STAGE IN THE PARLIAMENT RECYCLE BUT WHAT JOHN WINDOWS SUGGESTING IS THAT YOU HAVE MADE GAINS SINCE THE GENERAL ELECTION AND THAT ACTUALLY THE IDEA OF LABOUR BEING ON COURSE TO WIN THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION IS NOT A LITTLE
MY COMPARATOR WOULD BE MORE SO WITH LEADERS WHO HAVE BEEN IN FOR A YEAR IF YOU LOOK AT PAST LABOUR LEADERS AND AND INDEED PASS CONSERVATIVE LEADERS THEY'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT GAINS ONE OR TWO YEARS INTO THE PARLIAMENT SO AGAIN I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE CONTENT WITH STANDING STILL OR GOING BACKWARDS IN SOME AREAS AND I THINK NOW WE NEED TO SET OUR AND JEREMY NEEDS TO SET OUT MORE CLEARLY HIS VISION FOR THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO HOW HE'S GOING TO REACH OUT
TO THOSE VOTERS WHO WE'VE LOST TO THE TORIES AND UKIP AND S. AND P. AND STILL HAVE TO REGAIN THEIR SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE AND I SIMPLY DON'T THINK THE RESULTS OVERNIGHT FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN YET HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT WE ARE EN ROUTE TO GET BACK INTO POWER AND TO GET RID OF THIS WRETCHED TORY GOVERNMENT DOES IT PUT QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP TO ONE SIDE
WELL I THINK JEREMY WILL I'M SURE TODAY IN HIS OWN TIME RESPOND TO THE RESULTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMING IN BUT I CERTAINLY DO THINK THAT AS A PARTY AND HIM AS THEIR LEADER NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT JUST SPEAKING TO THE CONVERTED THEY CALL LABOUR VOTE THERE BUT WE ARE REACHING BEYOND THAT IT INTO JUST DIETING SURE OF HIS HEART IT PUTS TO BED DOESN'T IT ANY IDEA CERTAINLY IN THE SHORTER TERM OF ANY CHALLENGE TO HIM
NOBODY'S BEEN SPEAKING OF A CHALLENGE WE'VE GOT A EUROPEAN REFERENDUM IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS TIME AND I HATE THE IDEA WASN'T THAT WAS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE AFTER THAT BUT THAT'S THAT'S GONE THAT HASN'T IT
I DON'T ACCEPT THAT THAT'S BEEN THE IDEA WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE JOB AT HAND WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I AND I BELIEVE JEREMY IS COMMITTED TO THAT AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT SPEECH A FEW WEEKS AGO BEN YOU THINK HE'LL LEAD THE PARTY INTO THE NEXT ELECTION
WELL THAT WILL BE THAT WILL BE UP TO HIM TO A LARGE EXTENT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT HE WANTS TO DO BUT I RESPECT THE FACT THAT HE IS A LEADER BUT AGAIN I THINK HE HAS NOW HER RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT JUST CONTENT WITH KEEPING OUR CORE VOTE THAT WE ARE REACHING OUT BEYOND THAT TO THOSE SUPPORTERS WHO WE'VE LOST OVER THE YEARS TO AND AGAIN
OVERNIGHT IN THESE ELECTIONS TO THE CONSERVATIVES UKIP AND THE S.N.P. SO WEAK WE DO YOU REALLY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IF WE WANT TO GET BACK ON THE ROUTE TO POWER AND I REALLY DO THINK THE RESULTS OVERNIGHT WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO TO SUGGEST THAT WE'RE EN ROUTE TO GETTING RID OF THIS WRETCHED TORY GOVERNMENT WHICH WE ALL WANT TO DO IN THE LABOUR PARTY AND THANK YOU
TWENTY TWO MINUTES AFTER SEVEN MORE NOW THE ROW OVER V.H.S. BUSINESS NEWS COMES THIS MORNING FROM LUCY BUT THANKS NICK SIR PHILIP GREEN THE BUSINESSMAN FACING TWO PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES INTO THE SALE OF B.H.S. A YEAR BEFORE IT COLLAPSED HAS DEMANDED THE FRANK FIELD RESIGN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE COM COMMONS WORK AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE MY FIELD HAD SUGGESTED TO PHILIP'S KNIGHTHOOD COULD BE AT STAKE OVER HUGE B.H.S. PENSION GAP SO PHILIP HIT BACK IN THE LETTER TO FIELD SAYING HE WANTED TO AVOID A TRIAL BY MEDIA
HE TOLD THE FINANCIAL TIMES NEWSPAPER HE WAS HORRIFIED BY THE M.P.S COMMENTS WERE GEORGE MCDONALD FROM RETAIL WEEK IS IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING SIR PHILIP HAS COME IN FOR WIDESPREAD CRITICISM HASN'T HE AFTER THE RETAILER COLLAPSED A YEAR AGO HE SOLD IT FOR A POUND ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS AT REST FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUND PENSION FUND BLACK HOLE BUT IS HE REALLY TO BLAME BECAUSE HE DID SELL IT HE WOULD
AND HE DID AND HE SOLD IT TO PEOPLE WHO KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TAKING ON AND THEY WERE BUYING SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD TURN AROUND SO TO THAT EXTENT HIS CASE IS PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE AND THEY NEED TO BE QUESTIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHOSE WHAT
HE WAS UNDER WHEN B.H.S. COLLAPSED BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS UNDER SCRUTINY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHERE THEY FIT PEOPLE TO BE GIVEN CONTROL OF THE H. S. THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS AND OF COURSE ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHETHER HE'LL PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND FILL THIS DEFICIT HIMSELF HE'S ONLY PRECEDENTS FOR THIS AT ALL I CAN'T MAKE HIM DO IT SURELY I DON'T THINK SO WHEN THESE DEALS ARE DONE YOU TIPPING YOU CAN'T MOVE FOR A LAWYER IS
AND DOING ALL THE DUE DILIGENCE BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT IT'S BECOME A SORT OF MORAL ARGUMENT SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH NOW ABOUT THE LEGALITIES IN THE DETAILS PEOPLE ARE ASKING IS HE RIGHT OR WRONG THAT HE MADE MONEY FROM B.H.S. AND NOW THE FORMER EMPLOYEES FACE LOWER PENSIONS
AND OF COURSE HE'S UP IN FRONT OF THE M.P.S WHAT KIND OF PERFORMANCE CAN WE EXPECT IS QUITE A FLAMBOYANT FIGURE ISN'T HE YEAH HE'S GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING YOU HE'S A BIG PERSONALITY HE CAN BE VERY CHARISMATIC ENTERTAINING AMUSING AND HE'S ALSO THOUGH A REALLY EXPLOSIVE TEMPER AND SOMETIMES AND YOU NICKLEBY I'M UNSURE WATCHING OUT THERE HE DOESN'T LOSE THAT TEMPER IN THE PUBLIC EYE
SURELY ALL OF THIS POLITICAL THEATRICS IS GOING TO START TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE REAL ISSUE HERE WHICH IS THAT WORKERS' JOBS AND THEIR PENSIONS ARE AT RISK THAT'S WHY HE'S SO THE HOOK HAS GOT TO BE THAT BUYERS ARE FOUND FOR B.H.S. EITHER AT THE WHOLE BUSINESS WHICH I THINK WILL BE DIFFICULT OR MORE LIKE THE PEOPLE WERE BUYING UP PARCELS OF STORIES AND CONVERT THEM TO THEIR THEIR OWN FAITH SHOWS
YEAH THEY ARE THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING IS ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHOSE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN GEORGE MCDONALD THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU LUCY TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN

HAVE WON THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ELECTION FOR A THIRD SUCCESSIVE TIME WITH AROUND TWO THIRDS OF THE RESULTS DECLARED THEY HAVE FIFTY EIGHT OUT OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE SEATS
THE PARTY GAINED ELEVEN CONSTITUENCY SEATS FROM LABOUR WHOSE DECLINE IN SCOTLAND HAS CONTINUED LABOUR'S KEZIA DUGDALE WAS THE ONLY PARTY LEADER NOT TO WIN HER CONTEST THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IT LOOKS LIKELY THAT THEY BECOME THE SECOND OUT POLLING NEIGHBOUR NORTH OF THE BORDER FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE THE LIB DEMS IN SCOTLAND SAY THEY'VE TURNED A CORNER AT GAINING TWO SEATS
IN ENGLAND AROUND TWO THIRDS OF LOCAL ELECTION RESULTS HAVE BEEN DECLARED AND THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE CHANGE LABOUR HAVE PERFORMED BETTER THAN WAS EXPECTED THEY HAVE RETAINED CONTROL OF COUNCILS AND SOUTHAMPTON CRAWLEY AND REDDITCH WHICH WAS SEEN AS VULNERABLE THEIR SHARE OF THE VOTE IS HIGHER THAN IT WAS IN LAST YEAR'S LOCAL ELECTIONS THE CONSERVATIVES VOTE IS CLEARLY DOWN IN ENGLAND AND HAS FALLEN PARTICULARLY HEAVILY IN THE SOUTH
LABOUR HAVE WON THE LIVERPOOL MAYORAL CONTEST AND TWO PARLIAMENTARY BY ELECTIONS IN OG MORE AND SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE AND TO HILLSBOROUGH IN WALES LABOUR IS ON COURSE TO HOLD ONTO POWER DESPITE SEEING ITS VOTE SHARE DROPPED MARKEDLY COMPARED WITH FIVE YEARS AGO IN AN UNEXPECTED RESULT IT LOST THAT APPLIED CAMMY'S LEADER LEANNE WOULD UKIP HAS ONE AROUND THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN WALES ENOUGH TO GET REPRESENTATION IN THE ASSEMBLY FOR THE FIRST TIME

TURNS AFTER PARLIAMENTARY REBELLIONS A BUDGET THAT UNRAVELLED WITHIN DAYS OF BEING DELIVERED NOT THE IDEAL BACKDROP FOR THE TORIES FIGHTING THESE ELECTIONS SO NO DOUBT THEY'LL TELL US THEY'RE RELIEVED NOT TO HAVE DONE A WHOLE LOT WORSE

A NEW LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IS NORMALLY CHOSEN TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE MICHAEL FOOT WHEN HE WAS ELECTED LEADER GOT NEARLY A THOUSAND SEATS IN THIS FIRST COUNCIL ELECTIONS FOR LABOUR TO HAVE GONE BACKWARDS
SAYING EFFECTS THAT THE PERFORMANCE UNDER HAD MILLIBAND AS THE HIGH WATERMARK OF PERFORMANCE IS EXTRAORDINARY SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD MATCH THE BEST NEWS FOR YOU CAME IN SCOTLAND WILL YOU START LISTENING TO YOUR LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON SHE WARNED AGAINST TECH CUTTING TAX CREDITS YOU PLOUGHED ON UNTIL HAVING TO DO A U. TURN SHE'S WARNED YOU ABOUT ABANDONING WORKING CLASS SUPPORTERS HAS OFTEN BEEN IGNORED WASHING ABI LISTEN TO IN LONDON THAT'S WHAT RUTH DAVIDSON IS A IS A FANTASTIC CAMPAIGN IF SHE'S HAD A GREAT RESULT IN SCOTLAND AND SHE IS VERY
CLOSE TO ALL OF US IN WESTMINSTER WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME LISTEN TO HER ALL THE TIME BUT I DISAGREE WITH THE REPEATEDLY FORGIVE ME BUT REPEATEDLY ON WELFARE CUTS FOR EXAMPLE RUTH IN A SAID PARTY HAS GOT IT WRONG THEY ARE NOT LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE AND REPEATEDLY YOU'VE BEEN FORCED TO CHANGE YOUR MIND IN ORDER TO
WHAT ISN'T YOU KNOW FROM ALL OF THE REPORTING THIS THAT AND THE SORT OF POINTS BEHIND WHAT I SAID THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE GOVERNING YOU'VE GOT DIFFICULT CHOICES TO MAKE SIX YEARS INTO IT WE'VE GOT A REQUIREMENT TO TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT AND TWO TO GO INTO SURPLUS THIS GOVERNMENT INVOLVES DIFFICULT CHOICES AND OF COURSE YOU MAKE THEM IN THERE THE BEST WAY YOU CAN AND YOU LISTENED BUT ACTUALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE IT WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR THE ORDINARY WORKING PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY
WE HAVE HELD THE THE SEATS THAT WE THAT WE CAME ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IF YOU ARE IN PLACES WHERE LABOUR YOU'D NEED TO MAKE PROGRESS IN YOUR CITY LIKE PORTSMOUTH OUTFITS ON O.K. LET'S SAID THAT THE JEREMY CAUGHT WHEN HE'S A DISASTER FRUIT HE'S LONG BEEN A CRITIC OF JEREMY GOT THE LEADERSHIP IN AND THEY'D INVITE MANY SEATS LET'S MOVE ON TO AN ELECTION THAT WE HAVEN'T GOT THE RESULT OF ALL THAT PEOPLE HAVE VOTED WHICH IS LONDON WE GET THE RESULT LATER
ON TODAY PROBABLY MONEY BY LATE AFTERNOON ANDREW BOFF OF THE CONSERVATIVE GROUP INDEED HE'S THE LEADER OF THE GREATER LONDON ASSEMBLY GROUP HAS SAID OF YOUR CAMPAIGN WHICH LOOKS AS THOUGH HE'S GOING TO LOSE THAT ZAC GOLDSMITH WILL PROBABLY LOSE HE SAID THIS WASN'T EVEN A DOG WHISTLE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE EVERYBODY COULD HEAR IT IT WAS EFFECTIVELY SAYING PEOPLE OF CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS VIEWS ON NOT TO BE TRUSTED YOU DID A TIME SEEM TO BE SAYING OF YOUR LABOUR OPPONENT
YOU DO KNOW HE'S A MUSLIM DON'T YOU NO I DO I REJECT SO COMPLETELY WE FIRST OF ALL WHY DOES ANDREW FOR SWAN TERMS OF THE RESULT I THINK WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO CHILL SHALL WAIT TO SEE THE FORGIVE ME I'M NOT QUOTING ANY BUT I'M QUOTING THE LEADER OF YOUR GROUP ANOTHER I DO I DISAGREE WITH WITH WOPS WHAT YOU'VE JUST QUOTED ON THAT WHEN IT COMES TO
TO THE TO THE ELECTION IN LONDON WE WILL WE WILL SEE THE RESULT WHEN IT COMES BUT ONE OF THE THINGS ANYWAY ISN'T IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS CLEAR OVER RECENT WEEKS IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN AND THERE IS A PROBLEM IN THE LABOUR PARTY OF PEOPLE TRYING TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH THE THE LABOUR PARTY WHO HAVE VERY EXTREME VIEWS GOATS YOU PLAY ON I WANT TO I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE MORE RUN OUT OF TIME YOU O.K. HAS POINTED OUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM SHOUTED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THAT IN A LONDON ELECTION
IS IT IS ABSOLUTELY REASONABLE EVEN THOUGH THE LEADER OF THE PARTY LONDON DOESN'T THINK IT IS BUT LET'S MOVE ON YOU KNOW THAT THE POLICE HAVE NOW LAUNCHED ONE INVESTIGATION THERE ARE CALLS FOR VERY MANY OTHERS INTO ELECTION EXPENSES NOW THE CLAIM IS THAT THE TORY PARTY CENTRALLY PAID FOR PEOPLE TO BE BUSSED INTO SEAT OFF TO SEAT IN THE GENERAL ELECTIONS BUT DIDN'T BILL IT TO THE LOCAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN A VERY VERY SERIOUS CHARGE INDEED IS IT TIME TIS A BIT SOMETHING BADLY WENT WRONG
ON THE ON THE NATIONAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN BATTLE BOSSES FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL THAT HAVE TOURED THE COUNTRY THAN BEEN POLICE INVESTIGATIONS FOR TIME IMMEMORIAL IN THERE IS NOW ACTUALLY FOR FOR ELECTIONS THEY WERE OFTEN SO INVESTIGATIONS AS TO HER AS TO HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED I.
EVERY REASON TO YOU TO SUPPOSE THAT THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE HAD AND ALL PARTIES HAD WITH NATIONAL BATTLE BOSSES THEY GET REPORTED IN THAT HE CAN BE REQUIRED WAY ELECTORAL COMMISSION OVERSEE THESE MATTERS IT'S RIGHT FOR THEM TO TO TO MAKE THEIR OWN ASSESSMENT

SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO GETTING DRIVERLESS CARS ON BRITISH MOTORWAYS WE'VE TALKED ENDLESSLY ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S HERE NOW WELL KIND OF HERE YOU STILL HAVE TO BE A DRIVER AND YOU'RE STILL IN CHARGE BUT THERE COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE FULL AUTONOMY IN A FEW YEARS AMBER CERTAINLY KEPT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL AND CHANGE LANES AT THE FLICK OF A SWITCH RIGHT NOW FANS OF DRIVERLESS CARS LED OF COURSE BY GOOGLE TELL US THAT IT WILL ALL BE SAFER
THIS WEEK A DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF BRITISH INSURERS SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE GREAT THERE WAS A DANGER THAT SOME ACCIDENTS COULD BE CAUSED BY NOTICED SIMPLY THINKING THEY CAN STOP PAYING ATTENTION SOME CARS IN THE U.K. LIKE TEST LOVES MODEL S. WILL ALREADY BRAKE ACCELERATE STEER IF YOU BUY A SOFTWARE PACKAGE THEY CALL IT AUTO PILOT AS I'VE BEEN FINDING OUT
WE'RE INSIDE THE CAR AND THIS IS AN EXCITING MOMENT BECAUSE I'M WITH TESSLER SPOKESPERSON MAY DON'T GIVE OUT THEIR NAMES WHEN THEY DOING BROADCASTING BUT SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING HELLO TO YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE US TO WHAT AUTO PILOT IT AUTO PILOT IS A HANDS ON FEATURE
TO ENABLE THE DRIVER TO FEEL SAFER IN THE CAR WE'RE LOOKING AT A SCREEN WHERE IT DESCRIBES THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO FOR US YES RIGHT NOW THE CAR IS ABLE TO DO AUTO STIRRING FOR YOU AUTO LANE CHANGE AND IT HAS A TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM AS WELL THERE WE ARE
RIGHT WE'VE CHANGED POSITIONS THIS IS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH I'M NOW IN THE DRIVING SEAT WHICH INITIALLY LOOKS LIKE DRIVING ANY ORDINARY AUTOMATIC CARS OR TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO DO
YOU SIMPLY PUSH THE DRIVER STALK ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE DOWN UNTIL YOU AND DEE HAS DONE AND LIGHTLY TAP ON THE ACCELERATOR I'M GOING THAT WE'RE
AND IT HAS THE SAME RESPONSE OF ANY ELECTRIC CAR HAS WHICH IS IMMEDIATE AND IT'S REALLY NOTICEABLY A MEDIUM AND I'M DRIVING NOW AROUND SMALL ROUNDABOUT
TOWARDS THE OPEN ROAD
RIGHT WE'RE OUT ON THE MOTORWAY NOW AND WE'RE DOING SIXTY MILES AN HOUR AND I WOULD LIKE SOME HELP DRIVING TELL ME WHAT TO DO IF YOU PRESS THE STORE
OR DO YOU TWICE
IT WILL ENABLE AUTISTIC AND TRATH QUICKIES CONTROL O.K. I'M GOING TO DO THAT
HAPPENED OH IT'S A REALLY STRANGE FEEL
BECAUSE THE WHEEL IS NOW MOVING I'VE GOT MY HANDS ON IT I HASTEN TO ADD BUT THE WHEELERS MOVE
WE'VE SLOWED DOWN BECAUSE AS A CAR IN FRONT OF US
WE'VE SLOWED TOO
MOOMIN SAFELY BEHIND IT I'VE GOT MY FEET ARE NOTHING NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR NOT ON THE BRAKE
I'VE GOT MY HANDS ON THE WHEEL BUT THE WILL HAS REALLY GOT A MIND OF ITS OWN IS QUITE A STRONG PAUL IT'S DOING WHAT IT THINKS WHAT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP US RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LANE AND I'M ACTUALLY DOING AT THE MOMENT NOTHING
WHICH IS A STRANGE STRANGE FEELING BECAUSE WE ARE DOING WELL WE WERE DOING SIXTY WHEN ADDING FIFTY MILES AN HOUR
NOW HOW ABOUT DOING THE OTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO THAT JUST FEELS EXTRAORDINARY THAT IS CHANGING LANES WITHOUT DOING THE LANES HINGING YOURSELF
IF YOU FLICK THE INDICATOR HERE CAR WILL CHANGE LANES I'M GOING THAT I FLICKED THE INDICATOR
AND IT IS THE WHEEL HAS JUST MOVED ME VERY EFFICIENTLY OUT INTO THE MIDDLE LEG AND IF I STOP THE INDICATOR WE JUST STAY IN HOW DO WE IN THIS LANE
THAT'S INTERESTING SOMEONE IS COMING UP ON THE INSIDE LANE NOW WHICH YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO DO THEY'RE JUST PASSED US ON THE INSIDE LANE THE CAR AS NOT PANIC THERE'S A LITTLE SIGN SUGGESTING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE
HE'S MAKING A RUDE SIGN ACTUALLY IS YOU GET A MAN IN A WHITE VAN MAKING A RUDE SIGN
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF HIM DRIVE PRESENTLY PREP
WHAT HAPPENS IF I TAKE MY HANDS OFF THE WHEEL
THERE ARE SENSORS IN THE STEERING WHEEL SO YOU WILL SEE A WARNING ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL
REMINDING YOU TO TAKE CONTROL BACK IN THE CAR SO THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DRIVING VERY LONG DISTANCES
WITH YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL THAT IS NOT REALISTIC AND IT'S NOT WHERE YOU GOING FOR THE THIS AREN'T I IT'S THE DRIVER AID AND SHOULD BE SEEN AS A DRIVER
I SAY AT THE MOMENT THE CAR IS JUST NAVIGATING US THROUGH QUITE TRICKY TRAFFIC
RIGHT WELL THAT'S IT WE'RE OFF THE MOTORWAY WE'RE ON TO THAT BORING LITTLE ROADS AND CRUCIALLY I AM BACK IN CONTROL AND THE POINTER SPACE IS THAT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS I'M DOING INCLUDING RECORDING THEIR SEVENTH STILL THINKING ABOUT THAT MAN IN THE WHITE VAN THAT ACTUALLY MAKE ME LESS SAFE
THEN THE COMPUTER AND ALSO COURSE THINKING ABOUT WHERE I'M GOING AND I CAN SEE THE TELLS THAT SIGN SO I'M DOING
AND THE NEW ARE OFF THE ROAD NOW AND I AM GOING TO BE PARKING THE CAR MYSELF THEY FOR HOW MUCH LONGER
THEY'RE IN TIME WE'LL DISCUSS THIS WITH AMONG OTHER PEOPLE WANT SOMEONE WHO IS QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY IMPLICATIONS AND THE FACT THAT ACTUALLY YOU COULD IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL AND IT DID CLOSE YOUR EYES ALTHOUGH IT WOULDN'T BE ADVICE LITTLE UNNERVING IF YOU WERE PULLING ALONGSIDE ONE OF THOSE DROPLETS GIRLS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER AND ON GLASGOW STUDIO THIS MORNING IS JOHN BELL OF THE IONA CAME COMMUNITY
GOOD MORNING MY EARLIEST MEMORIES OF CHILDREN WITH DOWN'S SYNDROME STILL EMBARRASSES ME THAT GIVEN THE NAME WHICH I'D RATHER NOT REPEAT WHO ADDRESSED AND GOOD FOR AND SO THEY WOULDN'T DRAW ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES AND PEOPLE WOULD SEE IN A GUARDING THE P.M.'S THAT IT WAS A SHAME FOR THEM TO HAVE HAD SUCH A CHILD
BUT SINCE THEN I'VE MET CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WITHOUT SOME DRUM WHO CLEARLY HER LOVE LIFE LOVE BEING DRESSED IN BRIGHT COLOURS AND WHO HAVE BROUGHT DELIGHT TO THE PARENTS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF THEM CAN HOLD DOWN A JOB LIVE INDEPENDENTLY ODD AND SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION AND ME EVEN COMPETE IN THE PARALYMPICS
THERE'S HAYTHAM EXPECTATION AND FULFILMENT OF SUCH YOUNG PEOPLE AS A NO SMALL BE DUE TO THE PIONEERING WORK OF THE FRENCH CANADIAN JEAN VAN
THROUGH HIS EXPERIENCE OF LIVING WITH SEVERELY DISABLED PEOPLE HERE REALISE THAT THEY WERE SEEN MORE FOR THE PERCEIVED PROBLEM RATHER THAN FOR THEIR POTENTIAL
AND HE BEGAN TO INTERNATIONAL LUSH COMMUNITY TO PERVADE APPROPRIATE KIA AND CHANGE ATTITUDES SO IT WAS INTERESTING TO LISTEN YESTERDAY AND THIS PROGRAMME THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE EFFICACY AND ETHICS OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF MEDICAL TESTING WHICH TRIED TO ASSESS WHETHER THE FOETUS AND THE ROOM HAS A LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING BONES
I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE VEXATIOUS ISSUES AROUND THE POSSIBILITY OF PET MEETING HER PREGNANCY ON THE GROANS OF THE RESULTS OF SUCH A TEST I WOULD RATHER TO THINK OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SUCH A CHILD IS BORN
PEOPLE ME AUTOMATICALLY SEE THAT HER CHILD WITH STONES WILL CHANGE THEIR PARENTS' LIVES THAT'S TRUE THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH HER CHANGE OF EXPECTATIONS BUT THEN ANY CHILD SHOULD CHANGE ITS APPEARANCE LIVES IF THEY LOVE HMM
FOR ME THIS YEAR WHETHER THE COMMUNITY AND TO WHICH IT'S BORN WILL BE WELCOMING BUT I BELIEVE THAT SUCH CHILDREN ESSENTIAL TO THE HEALTH OF OUR SOCIETY
I SEE THIS BECAUSE I'VE NOTICED RECENTLY AND READING THE GOSPELS HOW JESUS HAS A CONSISTENT HABIT OF REHABILITATING PEOPLE WHOM SOCIETY HAD MARGINALISED NOT JUST TACTICAL EIGHT THOUSAND PROSTITUTES BUT PEOPLE WHO WERE STIGMATISED BECAUSE OF THEIR MENTAL OR PHYSICAL DISORDER
HE SENDS PEOPLE PRESUME TO BE DEMON POSSESSED PEOPLE WHO HAD LEPROSY PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED BACK INTO THE SOCIETIES WHICH HAD FORCIBLY EXCLUDED
THAT THEY'RE NOW VEIN INITIATIVE SUGGEST TO ME THAT PERHAPS THOSE OF US REDEEM OURSELVES NOT MOLE WILL ONLY BE CURED OF THEIR DISEASE OF ARROGANT PERFECTIONISM WHEN WE ARE TOUCHED SOCIALLY AND PHYSICALLY BY THOSE FROM WHOM WE MIGHT BE PRONE TO A VET OR EYES
IT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THOSE WHO HAVE THEIR OWN CENTRUM MAYBE THE VERY PEOPLE THROUGH WHOM SOCIETY HAS HEALED
THAT WAS JOHN BELL OF THE IONA COMMUNITY THE TIME NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW THE BINGLEY WIN LAST NIGHT FOR THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY GETTING ON FOR HALF OF ALL SCOTS WHO VOTED VOTED FOR THE S. AND P. THE BIG FIGHT REALLY IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION WAS FOR SECOND PLACE BETWEEN LABOUR AND THE CONSERVATIVES AND IT'S A FIGHT THAT THE CONSERVATIVES SEEM TO HAVE ONE LET'S GET A QUICK REPORT ON WHAT THE STORY OF THE KNIGHT WAS WITH OUR SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT COLIN BLACK
WHAT IS NO BEYOND DATE IS AT THE S.N.P. HAS WON I THOUGHT CONSECUTIVE
SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ELECTION THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE SCOTTISH
SO IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN THE S.N.P. SWEPT TO ANOTHER OVERWHELMING WIN BUT NICOLA STURGEON WASN'T THE ONLY SCOTTISH LEADER WAS CAUSED TO CELEBRATE WITH DAVIDSON THIS JEWELLERY
THE SCOTTISH TORY LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON PRODUCED ONE OF THE SHOCKS OF THE NIGHT WHEN SHE CAPTURED EDINBURGH CENTRAL FROM THE S.N.P. THE CONSERVATIVES TO EASTWOOD AND THEM FREE SURE FROM LABOUR WHO SUPPORT CONTINUED TO LEAK AWAY
RUTH DAVIDSON SAID THE S.N.P. SHOULD TAKE NOTICE THEY'D BE FACING REAL OPPOSITION
THE PEOPLE WANT US TO DO A VERY SPECIFIC JOB AND IT'S A JOB THAT ME AND MY TEAM OF M.S.P.S ARE COMING IN TAKE EXCEPTIONALLY SERIOUSLY AND THAT IS TO HAUL THE S.N.P. TO ACCOUNT TO HAVE THE SORT OF LEVEL OF CHALLENGE AND SCRUTINY OF DEBATE IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT WE'VE NOT SEEN IN THE LAST NINE YEARS AND I THINK THAT'S A JOB THAT WE CAN DO
THERE WAS SOME COMFORT FOR THE SCOTTISH LIB DEMS THEY LEADER WILLIE RENNIE FOUGHT A STRONG CAMPAIGN TO TAKE NORTH EAST FIFE FROM THE S. AND P.
I HAVE TO SAY I'VE HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE IN THIS CAMPAIGN I CAMPI AS TO TRY AND MAKE SCOTLAND THE BEST AGAIN IN THE WORLD INVESTING IN EDUCATION GUARANTEEING OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES PROTECTIN THE INVITE
BUT THE S.N.P. CAN INTO THE SELECTION FROM OUR HIGH BASE THEY TOO HAD SIGNIFICANT WINS TAKING COWDENBEATH FROM LABOUR FOR EXAMPLE AND KEEPING OUT WAS DEPUTY LEADER ALEX ROWLEY
IAN GRAY IS A FORMER LEADER OF SCOTTISH LABOUR WHO HAD TO STAND DOWN AFTER A BAD ELECTION RESULT IN TWENTY ELEVEN
SITUATION THERE IS VERY DIFFERENT SENSE THEN
CHANGED WE'D HAVE REPEATEDLY AND IT HAS NOT SERVED US WELL HERE'S HERE THOUGH
BECAME ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT HER LEADERSHIP WAS HE IN NOT AT THIS SELECTION WHERE THE LONGER RECOVERY FOR SCOTTISH
THE SCOTTISH GREENS WILL BE CELEBRATING THEY'LL HAVE MORE M.S.P.S THAN THEY DID LAST TIME THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEW SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT IS TAKING SHAPE
LET'S THANK EX CON BLAME OTHER WAY LET'S TALK TO JOHN SWINNEY DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLAND JOINS US NOW DON'T GET GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING CONGRATULATIONS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE YOU EXPECTING TO MARK WELL A REMARKABLE NIGHT INDEED INASMUCH AS WELL AS WE JUST WEAR HEARING FROM YOUR PARTY LEADER FROM THE FIRST MINISTER THAT IS A RECORD AND ACHIEVEMENT AND YET NOT YET CERTAIN THAT YOU'LL BE GOVERNING ALONE ARE YOU EXPECTING TO HAVE A MAJORITY
WE'VE GOT TO AWAIT THE FINAL RESULTS OFF THE ORIGINAL LIST THAT HAVE YET TO COME OUT THIS MORNING SO WILL KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IN THE COURSE OF THEIR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THIS MORNING
AT WHAT THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY HAS ACHIEVED OVERNIGHT OVER IS A TRULY REMARKABLE RESULT BECAUSE AS THEIR THIRD CONSECUTIVE ELECTION VICTORY FOR THE S.N.P. THE FIRST TIME SINCE DEVOLUTION THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTY AND WE'VE DONE THAT WITH THE HIGHEST EVER CONSTITUENCY VOTE SHE'LL HAVE HER OWN FORTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE VOTE SO IT'S A RINGING ENDORSEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY IN GOVERNMENT
AND IT'S A RESULT WITH WHICH WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED PIECE DOES IT NOT SHOW THEM THE FACT THAT WE DON'T YET KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FORM A GOVERNMENT WITHOUT HELP FROM ANOTHER PARTY DOESN'T IT SHOWED THAT ACTUALLY
PETE AND THAT THE APPEAL OF THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL BIG IS CERTAINLY NOT GETTING ANY BIGGER AND THERE'S IN SOME PARTS OF SCOTLAND REDUCING
WE'VE SEEN A WHOLE RANGE OF DIFFERENT GAINS FOR THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY TONIGHT WE HAVE OVERNIGHT WE KNOW HAVE FIFTY EIGHT SEATS AT ME ACTUALLY BE FIFTY NINE CONSTITUENCY SEATS WHICH IS MORE CONSTITUENCY SEATS THEN WE WON IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN BY THAT VERY MEASURE WE ARE GAINING GROUND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE ELECTION OVERNIGHT
AND WE'VE ACHIEVED A HIGHER SHARE OF THE VOTE AT THE ELECTION OVERNIGHT THEN WE ACHIEVE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN SO WE'VE GOT ALL OF THOSE MEASURES
AND IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT WE'VE PULLED OVER A MILLION CONSTITUENCY VOTE SWITCH NO PARTY IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ELECTION HAS EVER DONE BEFORE THESE ARE ALL INDICATORS OF THE CONTINUING STRENGTHENING OF THE POSITION OF THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY
WHERE WE COMMAND THE CONFERENCE OF PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND WE WANT TO DELIVER ON THEIR PRIORITIES AND THE COMMITMENTS THAT WE HAVE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND BUT NOT PERHAPS AS MUCH CONFIDENCE AMONG THOSE WHO DIDN'T VOTE YES IN THE REFERENDUM ON WHAT WE WERE HEARING EARLIER ON THE PROGRAMME FOR AND JOHN CURTIS AND OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED AS WELL IS THAT IN THOSE PLACES WHERE THE YES VOTE WAS
WEEK THEN THE VOTE FOR YOU THIS TIME HAS REDUCED IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION ISN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU ANY MORE YOU NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON OTHER THINGS AND ON GOVERNING IS THAT IT'S A FAIR POINT TO MAKE
WE'VE ALWAYS CONCENTRATED ON GOVERNING AS AS THE DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER AS A FINANCE MINISTER THROUGHOUT THE THE NINE YEARS OFF THE S.N.P. GOVERNMENT WE'VE CONCENTRATED ON GOVERNING OF DELIVERING A POLICY PRIORITIES
WHAT WE SET OUT IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN WAS AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAMME TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD IN SCOTLAND EVERY YOUNG PERSON IS ABLE TO FULFIL THEIR EDUCATIONAL KEEP ABILITY AND POTENTIAL AND TO ENSURE THAT WE ACTED THE LOVE OF THAT AND THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE PRIORITIES OF GOVERNMENT THAT THE FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON WILL TAKE FORWARD AS SHE LEADS THE S.N.P. GOVERNMENT AS SHE LEADS US
THIS THIRD CONSECUTIVE ELECTION VICTORY WHICH IS A QUITE REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT IN SCOTLAND JOHN'S WHEN DEPUTY LEADER DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLAND AND LEADER OF THE S.N.P. HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US FROM EDINBURGH

REFERENDUM TOO BECAUSE ON THE PANEL WITH THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR AND EURO PHILE KEN CLARKE DIANE ABBOTT THE SHADOW INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY WHO SUPPORTS REMAINING TWO
ALSO THE ECONOMIST GERARD LIONS HE WAS BORIS JOHNSON'S ECONOMIC ADVISER AND HE'S IN FAVOUR OF A BRICK SIT AND FORMER LABOUR M.P. TOM HARRIS WHO WAS DIRECTOR OF SCOTTISH VOTE LEAF IT'S A HEADY MIX DO JOIN ME FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE RADIO THEATRE AT BROADCASTING HOUSE IN LONDON AT EIGHT O'CLOCK TONIGHT
IN THE NEXT HOUR ON THIS PROGRAMME THE LABOUR LEADER AND DEPUTY LEADER I SHOULD SAY TOM WATSON AND THE PROS AND CONS OF DRIVERLESS CAR LOTS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR AND NICK ROBINSON AND JUSTIN WEBB
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE SIXTH OF MAY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE S.N.P. HAVE WON A THIRD TERM IN POWER BUT ARE LIKELY TO FALL SHORT OF ANOTHER OUTRIGHT MAJORITY IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT LABOUR HAS SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES ARE SET TO BE REPLACED BY THE CONSERVATIVES AS THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION AT HOLYROOD NEIGHBOURS RETAINED SOME KEY COUNCILS IN ENGLAND THAT LOST SEATS IN A PERFORMANCE DESCRIBED AS WEAK AND DISAPPOINTING BY SOME M.P.S
THE U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY IS ONE ENOUGH VOTES ACROSS WALES TO GAIN SEATS IN THE WELSH ASSEMBLY FOR THE FIRST TIME THE B.B.C. NEWS READ BY DYING TO SPEAK
THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY HAVE CLAIMED VICTORY IN ELECTIONS TO THE PARLIAMENT IN EDINBURGH BUT IT'S THOUGHT THEY'LL FALL SHORT OF AN OVERALL MAJORITY LABOUR PARTY WHICH WAS ONCE THE DOMINANT FORCE IN SCOTTISH POLITICS IS SET TO COME THIRD BEHIND THE CONSERVATIVES TO B. B. C. IS FORECASTING THE S.N.P. WILL WIN SIXTY THREE SEEDS THE TORIES THIRTY ONE AND LABOUR TWENTY FOUR
FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON SAID THE S.N.P. IS RE ELECTION FOR A THIRD TERM WAS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN ITS RECORD IN GOVERNMENT OUR FIRST REPORT IS BY HOW SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT COLIN BLANE
THE S.N.P. CAN INTO THIS CAMPAIGN ON THE BACK OF TWO REMARKABLE RESULTS THEY'LL LANDSLIDE IN LAST YEAR'S GENERAL ELECTION AND THEY'RE STUNNING MAJORITY VICTORY IN THE PREVIOUS HOLYROOD ELECTION IN TWENTY ELEVEN
THEY'RE HEADING FOR A WIN THIS TIME TOO BUT IT SEEMS THEY WILL FALL JUST SHORT OF AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY THEY MADE FRESH GAINS AT SCOTTISH LABOUR'S EXPENSE CAPTURING SEATS LIKE MOTHERWELL AND WISHAW AND GREENOCK AND INVERCLYDE FOR LABOUR IT WAS ANOTHER DRUBBING THIS WAS HOW THE S.N.P. LEADER NICOLA STURGEON DECLARED VICTORY
WHAT IS NO BEYOND DATE IS AT THE S. M. P. HAS WON I THOUGHT CONSECUTIVE
SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ELECTION THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
LABOUR LOST THIRTEEN SEATS MOST TO THE S. A. M. P. BUT THE CONTINUING COLLAPSE BENEFITED THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVES TO THE SCOTTISH TORIES TOOK EASTWOOD EMBLEM THREE SURE FROM LABOUR BUT THEY WON SEATS FROM THE S.N.P. AS WELL CAPPED BY RUTH DAVIDSON'S VICTORY IN EDINBURGH CENTRAL
THE PEOPLE WANT US TO DO A VERY SPECIFIC JOB AND IT'S A JOB THAT ME AND MY TEAM OF M.S.P.S ARE COMING IN TAKE EXCEPTIONALLY SERIOUSLY AND THAT IS TO HAUL THE S.N.P. TO ACCOUNT TO HAVE THE SORT OF LEVEL OF CHALLENGE AND SCRUTINY OF DEBATE IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT WE'VE NOT SEEN IN THE LAST NINE YEARS AND I THINK THAT'S A JOB THAT WE CAN DO
THE CONSERVATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO PUSH LABOUR INTO THIRD PLACE THE SCOTTISH GREENS WILL BE CELEBRATING AS WELL THEY'LL HAVE MORE M.S.P.S THAN THEY DID LAST TIME
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER WILLIE RENNIE WON A SEAT FROM THE S.N.P. HAS PARTY TAKING FOUR CONSTITUENCIES AND ALL
IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS IN ENGLAND LABOUR HAVE RETAINED CONTROL OF COUNCILS REGARDED AS VULNERABLE BUT HAVE LOST SEATS AS WELL ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNCIL RESULTS ARE NOW IN THEY'VE ALSO WON TWO WESTMINSTER BY ELECTIONS HOLDING ONTO ENCORE IN SOUTH WALES AND SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE AND HILLSBOROUGH HERE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN
A NIGHT OF LITTLE CHANGE BUT ONE THE TIN ITSELF TELLS ITS OWN STORY FOR JEREMY CORBIN RELIEF HAD RESULTS THAT DEPRIVE HIS CRITICS OF THE TRIGGER THEY SOUGHT TO CHALLENGE HIS LEADERSHIP BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS UNDERLINED THE DEEP DOLDRUMS INTO WHICH THE PARTY HAS SUNK WITH FURTHER LOSSES OF AROUND TWENTY FIVE COUNSELLORS
THOSE AROUND MISTER CORBIN HOWEVER HAD SEIZED ON THE PARTY'S SUCCESS IN HOLDING ON TO VULNERABLE COUNCILS IN THE SOUTH AND MIDLANDS SUCH AS CRAWLEY'S SOUTHAMPTON AND REDDITCH LABOUR THEY POINT OUT ALSO WON THE SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE BY ELECTION COMFORTABLY AND OVERALL LABOUR'S SHARE OF THE VOTE WAS UP FOUR PERCENT ON LAST YEAR
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL FEW COMPARE FROM WHEN JEREMY TOOK OVER TO NOW WE'RE ON A CLEAR PATH OF IMPROVEMENT
NOTHING MORE THAN THAT I DON'T EXAGGERATE IT I DON'T WANT TO OVER EMPHASISE I'M JUST SAYING THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT OUR STRATEGY IS ALL ABOUT MISTER CORBIN'S CRITICS HOWEVER INSIST THE PARTY SHOULD BE MAKING SIGNIFICANT GAMES AND POINT OUT NO LABOUR LEADER IN RECENT HISTORY HAS FAILED TO WIN SEATS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR
EVEN MICHAEL FOOT GAIN NEARLY A THOUSAND AND IN SCOTLAND WHICH MISTER CORBIN SAID WOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR HIM THE PARTY'S RESULT PUSHED INTO THIRD PLACE WAS DESCRIBED BY ONE CRITIC AS CATACLYSMIC UNTHINKABLE THE LABOUR M.P. EMMA REYNOLDS
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE CONTENT WITH STANDING STILL OR GOING BACKWARDS IN SOME AREAS AND I THINK NOW WE NEED TO SET OUT AND JEREMY NEEDS A SET OUT MORE CLEARLY HIS VISION FOR THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO HOW HE'S GOING TO REACH OUT
TO THOSE VOTERS WHO WE'VE LOST TO THE TORIES AND UKIP AND S. AND P. AND STILL HAVE TO REGAIN THEIR SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE FOR THE CONSERVATIVES SURPRISE AND SOME SATISFACTION THAT WITH ME A CIVIL WAR OVER EUROPE AND CLASHES OVER THE BUDGET THE PARTY HAS ONLY LOST ONE CANCEL WORCESTER GAINED PETERBOROUGH AND ACHIEVED A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE IN SCOTLAND THE COMMUNITIES SECRETARY GREG CLARK OPPOSITIONS EXPECT TO MAKE
BIG GAINS AGAINST PARTIES IN GOVERNMENT AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN WHAT YOU'VE BEEN REPORTING ON ALL MORNING IS A HUGE BREAKTHROUGH FOR US IN SCOTLAND LED BY RUTH DAVIDSON AND ACROSS THE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY I MEAN IT MIGHT EVEN LOOK AS IF WE MIGHT EVEN HAVE GAINED SEATS WHICH ARE WHICH IS I THINK UNPRECEDENTED
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS MEANWHILE AFTER YEARS OF CRUSHING REVERSES LOOKED TO HAVE HALTED THEIR REMORSELESS DOWNWARDS SPIRAL GAINING A CLUTCH OF COUNSELLORS WHILE U.K. POOP AGAIN COMES SECOND IN MANY TRADITIONAL LABOUR SEATS ARE AND CALLS TO GAIN AROUND FORTY COUNSELLORS AND SECURE A REPRESENTATION ON THE WELSH ASSEMBLY FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU COULD SAY THEY'RE HOPEFUL OF TAKING EIGHT SEATS IN THE WELSH ASSEMBLY HAVING ONE AROUND THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE VOTE LABOUR I EXPECTED TO HOLD ON TO POWER BUT THEY SUFFERED A SHOCK DEFEAT IN FROM THERE TO BLOOD CAMRY MARK HUTCHINGS REPORTS FROM THE COUNT IN CARDIFF
WELSH LABOUR SUFFERED ONE MAJOR CASUALTY THEY'D HAVE COMFORTABLY SECURED THEIR POSITION AS THE ASSEMBLY'S BIGGEST PARTY READY TO FORM THE NEXT GOVERNMENT WITH OR WITHOUT HELP TO GET A MAJORITY THE EARLY SIGNS WERE GOOD FOR LABOUR PICKING UP SUFFICIENT VOTES INKY SEATS HOLDING OFF THE CHALLENGE FROM THE TORIES IN PARTICULAR WREXHAM VALE OF CLWYD DOWN AND
THEN CAME THE BIG SHOCK GOVERNMENT MINISTER LADEN ANDREW'S LOSING HIS HONDA VALLEYS SEATS TO PRIDE LEADER LEANNE WOOD WHO A FEW OTHER TRIUMPHS FOR HER PARTY BUT THIS WAS A HUGE PERSONAL VICTORY
A NEW DAWN IS ABOUT TO BREAK IN WE'RE IN THE WRONG A NEW DAWN HAS ALREADY BROKEN OVER THE VALLEYS PEOPLE HAVE VOTED FOR CHANGE
ANOTHER LEADER OF THE LIB DEMS KIRSTY WILLIAMS FARED WELL INCREASING HER MAJORITY IN BRECON AND ROUND THE SHIP BUT IT WAS BITTER SWEET SHE COULD FIND HERSELF AS A PARTY OF ONE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND LIKE UKIP LATEST ESTIMATES SUGGEST THEY COULD PICK UP EIGHT SEATS ON THE REGIONAL LISTS THAT WOULD MAKE THEM A NOTABLE AND COLOURFUL FORCE IN AN ASSEMBLY WHICH WILL SURELY BE RUN BY A FAMILIAR LOOKING GOVERNMENT
JOE ANDERSON HAS BEEN RE ELECTED AS THE MAYOR OF LIVERPOOL FOR LABOUR THE OUTCOME OF A MAYORAL CONTESTS IN LONDON SALFORD IN BRISTOL WON'T BE KNOWN UNTIL LATER ON COUNTING HAS YET TO BEGIN IN THE ELECTION FOR THE NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY RESULTS ALSO WAITED AND ELECTIONS FOR ALMOST FORTY POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONERS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES
THE BOMBING OF A REFUGEE CAMP IN SYRIA HAS BEEN WIDELY CONDEMNED WITH THE UNITED NATIONS SING IT COULD AMOUNT TO A WAR CRIME AT LEAST THIRTY PEOPLE ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN YESTERDAY'S AIR STRIKES NEAR MY CLOSE TO THE TURKISH BORDER WHICH LOCAL PEOPLE ARE BLAMING ON THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT DIG LUBA FROM MERCY CORPS THE LARGEST NON GOVERNMENTAL OPERATION DELIVERING ASSISTANCE AND SYRIA TOLD US THE CAMP WAS IN PROBABLY ONE OF THE SAFEST AREAS OF THE COUNTRY
IT'S HORRIFIC AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANTED TO FRANKLY TWO TO DESCRIBE HAD LARGELY YESTERDAY WE SAW THE A STATION I BEING ENGLISH SHOOTERS HELD TO OTHER THAN A FEW HITS YOU AND THERE AND TRYING TWENTY LAST NIGHT HAD HAPPENED HAPPENED WE START TO FLYOVERS AND TO SEPARATE TWO SEPARATE HITS ONE OUTSIDE THE CAMP AND ONE INSIDE THE CAMP
BEFORE THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE PRESS OFFICER HER SAID THE FORCE CONTINUED TO TRY TO BLAME OTHERS FOR THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER DURING THE RECENT INQUESTS HAYLEY COURT CLAIM SHE WAS ASKED TO SPIN NEWS COMING OUT OF THE HEARINGS AND SHE FELT THE POLICE STRATEGY WAS TO ENSURE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENED WAS SHARED SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE THEY SAID THEY HAD LOOKED INTO CLAIMS OF UNETHICAL PRACTICE AND THEY WERE NOT SUBSTANTIATED
SIR PHILIP GREEN THE BUSINESSMAN FACING TWO PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES INTO THE SALE OF B.H.S. A YEAR BEFORE IT COLLAPSED HAS DEMANDED THAT FRANK FIELD RESIGN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMONS WORK AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE SO PHILLIPS OF THE VETERAN LABOUR M.P. WAS CLEARLY PREJUDICED MY FIELD IN RESPONSE HAS TOLD BE SINEWS THAT PARLIAMENT WILL NOT BE BULLIED MORE DETAILS MY BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT EMMA SIMPSON
PHILIP GREEN SAID HE WAS HORRIFIED BY WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS AN OUTRAGEOUS OUTBURST BY FRANK FIELD MY FIELD SUGGESTED TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES THAT HAVE SO PHILIP DIDN'T PAY FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS TO CLOSE THE GAP IN THE B.H.S. PENSION FUND HE WOULD RECOMMEND STRIPPING HIM OF HIS NIGHT HOOT THE RETAIL TYCOON HAS NOW WRITTEN TO MISTER FIELD
AS FELLOW LABOUR M.P. IAN WRIGHT CHEER OF ANOTHER PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE LOOKING INTO THE FAILURE OF B.H.S. EXPRESSING HIS CONCERN THAT THEY WERE LEAPING TO CONCLUSIONS BEFORE ANY EVIDENCE HAD BEEN HEARD
A RESCUE OPERATION IS UNDERWAY IN WESTERN CANADA TO STOP TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE FORCED FROM THEIR HOMES BY WILDFIRES FROM BECOMING TRAPPED BY THE ADVANCING FLAMES THE MOST VULNERABLE ARE BEING AIRLIFTED TO SAFETY THE FIRES HAVE ENGULFED THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SQUARE MILES AROUND THE ABANDONED CITY OF FORT MCMURRAY
THANK YOU DIANA IT IS TEN PAST EIGHT ELECTIONS ARE OF COURSE FIRST AND FOREMOST ABOUT WHO GOVERNS WHETHER IN TOWN HALLS OR ASSEMBLIES OR PARLIAMENTS BUT THESE ELECTIONS WERE ALSO THE FIRST TEST OF WHAT WAS HAILED AS THE NEW POLITICS THE PROMISE OF A GENUINE ALTERNATIVE THE CORBIN AFFECT A TEST TWO OF WHETHER THE LABOUR LEADERS MANY INTERNAL CRITICS WOULD COULD USE THESE RESULTS IS THE TRIGGER FOR A PUBLIC CHALLENGE THE PARTY OF GORDON BROWN THE PARTY JOHN SMITH LOOKS SET TO COME THIRD
YOU DID HEAR THAT RIGHT THIRD BEHIND THE CONSERVATIVES IN SCOTLAND LABOUR HAVE LOST SEATS IN COUNCIL ELECTIONS IN ENGLAND TO NO PARTY HAS DONE THAT HAD EVER GONE ON TO FORM THE NEXT ELECTION NEXT GOVERNMENT BUT AND IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT BUT IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND THEY HAVE HELD ON TO SOME COUNCILS MANY PREDICTED THEY'D LOSE THEIR VERDICT TO MISTER CORBIN'S CRITICS THOUGH IS SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH THIS IS THE PROGNOSIS OF THE FORMER WELSH SECRETARY PETER HAIN
THE LEADERSHIP HAS TO SHOW THAT IT CAN WIN THE CENTRE GROUND
AS WELL AS DOING WHAT JEREMY'S DONE VERY EFFECTIVELY IN BRINGING BILL LEFT BACK INTO THE PARTY YOU HAVE TO DO BOTH TO WIN THE KIND COMMANDING MAJORITY HE'S DONE A BIT OF THE FIRST TO SAY THE BRINGING THE LEFT BYE
AND BRING BACK VOTES FROM THE GREENS WHAT HE HASN'T SHOWN AN ABILITY ANYTHING LIKE HER ABILITY TO DO IS WIN THE CENTRE GROUND VOTES BUT WE NEED TO WIN A GENERAL ELECTION AND THIS WAS THE VERDICT FROM LABOUR M.P. EMMA REYNOLDS
WITH THE TORIES IN DISARRAY AND SIX YEARS OF TORY GOVERNMENT WE SHOULD BE MAKING SIGNIFICANT GAINS I SIMPLY DON'T THINK THE RESULTS OVERNIGHT HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT WE ARE EN ROUTE TO GET BACK INTO POWER AND TO GET RID OF THIS WRETCHED TORY GOVERNMENT TOM WATSON LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER JOINS ME ON THE LINE NOT GOOD ENOUGH IS THE VERDICT WAS TO WATSON
GOOD MORNING NICK YOU MAKE CERTAINLY A MIXED PICTURE FOR LABOUR I THINK THE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ALL VERY DISAPPOINTED FOR HER COLLEAGUES THAT LOST THEIR SEATS IN SCOTLAND I THINK I'M LEADER IN SCOTLAND CASEY WAS CARRIED A VERY HEAVY LOAD BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD RECOGNISE THAT AFTER THAT NEAR KNOCKOUT BLOW AT THE GENERAL ELECTION LABOUR WAS NOT GOING TO LEAP BACK TO POWER IN SCOTLAND OVERNIGHT THERE IS A LONG JOURNEY BACK TO WIN
BACK AND MIND IN SCOTLAND YOU'VE LET BACKWARDS INTO OPPOSITION HAVE YOU NOT WHO WE WILL TALK ABOUT ENGLAND I PROMISE BUT ON SCOTLAND OH KAY OF COURSE RECOVERY WAS NOT THAT LIKELY AT SUCH SPEED BUT YOU'VE GONE BACKWARDS COS YOU DO DEL FAILED TO WIN HER OWN SEAT AS THE LABOUR LEADER IN SCOTLAND YOU A THIRD TO THE CONSERVATIVES THE OFFICIAL LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IS A TORY IN SCOTT
IS IF THAT'S THE FINAL RESULT I'VE NOT SEEN THAT NICK I THINK WAS STILL WAIT FOR RESULTS TO COME IN YOU MAY BE AHEAD OF ME I'VE BEEN UP MOST OF THE NIGHT BUT NOT I THINK WHAT AFTER THE RESULT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION
TO ACTUALLY MAKE PROGRESS WE KNEW THAT WAS GOING TO BE SLOW AND ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE LEADERSHIP BECAUSE YOU TIPTOE WE HAVE DEVOLVED POLICY MAKING TO A PARTY AND SCOTT
SHE HAS TAKEN HER PARTY AND ON A ON A LOCK ON HER VERY FIRST JOURNEY SHE'S REPOSITIONED THE PARTY SHE NOW HAS A DISTINCT POLICY PLATFORM TO THAT OF THE S. AND P. BUT IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME TO GET THAT MESSAGE OVER AND YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S HARD TO SAY TOO
MEMBERS WHO WILL BE LICKING THEIR WOUNDS TODAY HAVING CAMPAIGNED SO HARD FOR THE PARTY ON THE GROUND
THEY NEED PATIENCE WHEN ELECTED JEREMY AS LEADER WHEN THEY ELECTED KEN SERIOUSLY
I THINK EVERYONE KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE A LONG JOURNEY BACK FOR LABOUR AFTER TWO MAJOR GENERAL ELECTION I SUPPOSE THEY'RE WORRY IS IS THERE ANY SIGN THAT THAT PATIENCE WILL BE REWARDED AND THE REASON THE SCOTTISH RESULT MATTERS SO MUCH AS YOU WELL KNOW IS NOT SIMPLY THAT IT MATTERS WHO RUN SCOTLAND WHO MIGHT BE THE OPPOSITION IN THE END BUT WITH YOUR LIVING AT ACCRINGTON BRIGHTON WITH YOUR LIVE IN CARDIFF WITH YOU LIVE IN BELFAST THIS COULD DETERMINE WHO THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM IS LABOUR CAN'T WIN AGAIN IN SCOTLAND YOU CAN'T WIN AGAIN
WE CERTAINLY HAVE TO MAKE PROGRESS IN SCOTLAND BEFORE THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION WE NEED TO WIN SOME SIKHS BACK IN SCOTLAND BEFORE THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION AND I THINK THE REMEDY TO THAT IS COMPLEX
YES IT'S ABOUT A POLICY PLATFORM IN SCOTLAND BUT ALSO I THINK SCOTTISH VOTERS WANT TO SEE THAT THE U.K. LABOUR PARTY HAS LEARNT THE LESSON OF THE REFERENDA
SO FOR EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE DO WANT ENGLISH DEVOLUTION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO DRIVING THE POWER RIGHT OF WESTMINSTER AND FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE THAT REAL AND I THINK THAT WOULD HELP
IN SCOTLAND WHERE I THINK VOTERS MIGHT HE IF LABOUR IT WAS DONE THAT IN ENGLAND THEY ARE LEARNING SOME LESSONS THAT TAKES TIME WE'VE GOT A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION BEING LED BY A SHADOW CABINET MEMBER JOHN TRICKETT
THAT WILL START TO SCALE UP OVER THE SUMMER START TO SORT OF HAVE MEANING MEANING FOR DEBATE WITH OUR LEADERS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT WHAT ENGLISH DEVOLUTION LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE CALLED FOR PATIENT SORT OF SATAY NICK IS I GUESS WHAT I'M REALLY SAYING TO YOU IS THAT THE REMEDY IS VERY COMPLEX AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT I UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE TASK AHEAD AND I THINK THAT'S THE POINT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME TOO
I'M SUCH A DAY UNDERSTAND HER SERIOUS LABOUR SITUATION IS YES I DO WITH THAT AND GUIDANCE I GUESS AS TO WHAT PATIENTS MIGHT BRING NOW THERE IS BETTER NEWS THE MOST PUNDITS PREDICTED IN THOSE SOUTHERN COUNCILS WHICH YOU HELD ON TO THAT SOUTHAMPTON'S THE EXETER'S AND OTHERS ARE YOU SAYING THERE'S SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN GETTING RIGHT THAT SOMEHOW JEREMY CORBIN IS GETTING THROUGH A CONTRARY TO ALL PREDICTIONS FOR THE COUNTRY THAT TO THOSE SOUTHERN ENGLISH VOTERS
OR OR FRANKLY IS IT NOT NEARLY GOOD ENOUGH MICHAEL FOOT AFTER ALL ONE THOUSAND COUNCIL SEATS WHEN HE WAS LEADER OF THE LABOUR BELTING WENT TO A TERRIBLE GENERAL ELECTION LOSSES AS YOU KNOW
I GUESS WHAT I'M REALLY SAYING IS IT IT'S NOT EASY TO DRAW SIMPLE CONCLUSIONS PARTICULARLY WHEN MOST OF THE LABOUR PARTY HAS BEEN AWAKE MOST OF THE NIGHT AND WE'RE STILL ANALYSING THESE RESULTS BUT THERE WAS DEFINITELY CALLS FOR COMFORT WITH THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESULTS IN ENGLAND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CRAWLEY IS ALL THE REDDITCH WRITTLE HARLOW OR SOUTHAMPTON
IT HAS YES THESE WERE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOCAL CONDITIONS BUT THESE ARE STILL GOING TO BE THE ELECTORAL BATTLE GROUNDS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION YOU KNOW OUR LOTS OF COLLEAGUES INTERPRET THAT CALL FOR PATIENTS THEY SAY TOM WATSON HE'S A CANNY MAN HE EVEN TRIED TO GET RID OF GORDON BROWN AT ONE STAGE THEY SAY WHAT HE'S REALLY TELLING US HE'S DON'T MOVE AND NOW THERE MAY BE A MOMENT TO MOVE AGAINST JEREMY CORBIN BUT IT'S TOO SOON
OR NONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID THAT TO ME THAT YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WAS EVER SAID THAT TO ME SO I WOULD IF YOU WHAT DO THEY SAY JOINS TO JOURNALIST THEY SAY THINGS TO US BELIEVE ME
I MEAN WHAT WHAT TASTE TO THEM ON THAT IS LOOK M.P.S OF COURSE ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT LEADERS WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY
BUT OUR MEMBERS LEAD THE LABOUR PARTY NIGHT THE ONE THING JEREMY AGREE ON VERY STRONGLY IS THAT WE WANT MEMBER LED PARTY
HE WAS ELECTED WITH A VERY STRONG MANDATE ONLY EIGHT MONTHS AGO BUT ISN'T THE MANDATE FROM THE PUBLIC WHAT MATTERS IN OTHERWISE YES HE HAS CLEARLY IMPORTANT AND HE HAD A HUGE HUGE VICTORY AMONGST MEMBERS BUT IN THE END DOESN'T THE MANDATE OF THE ELECTORATE TRUMP ANY MANDATE FROM THE PEOPLE WHO PAID A FEW QUID TO JOIN A POLITICAL PARTY
YES OF COURSE IT DOES BUT ALSO I THINK EVEN OUR OPPONENTS WHO WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE LABOUR PARTY WOULD SAY THAT AFTER EIGHT MONTHS IT WOULD BE VERY UNFAIR AND IMPROPER ACTUALLY
TO HANG THIS SET OF ELECTION RESULTS ON JEREMY CORBIN'S PEG ALONE AFTER ONLY EIGHT MONTHS PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE NEEDS MORE TIME
TO SHOW THAT DIRECTION THOUGH LABOUR NEEDS TO TAKE TO WIN THAT TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION TOM WATSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND LISTENING TO THAT OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA COONS BAG UNFAIR AND IMPROPER TO JUDGE THIS HE SAYS LAURA IS THAT HOW IT WILL BE SEEN BY THOSE WHO MIGHT WISH MISTER CORBIN TO BE ANYWHERE BUT LABOUR LEADER I DON'T THINK THAT IS HOW IT WILL BE SEEN NICK I THINK FOR MANY OF THEM IT WILL BE SEEN AS CONFIRMATION OF THEIR PRIVATE WORRIES AND FAIRY REAL FEARS THEY HAVE
THAT JEREMY CORBIN'S FOCUS IS TRYING TO PLEASE PARTY MEMBERS RATHER THAN CONCENTRATING ON MAKING HIMSELF AND THE PARTY ELECTABLE PLEASING LARGE NUMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AVERTING DISASTER DOES NOT TRANSLATE INTO A GOOD RESULT FOR THE LABOUR PARTY WHY DO I SAY THAT WHEN THE LABOUR LOSSES OVERNIGHT DON'T SOUND THAT DRAMATIC THEY WERE LESS THAN SOME PEOPLE ANTICIPATED AND THEY HAVE INCREASED THEIR VOTE SHARE ON LAST YEAR A LITTLE BIT WELL
IF LABOUR WAS TO SHOW THE KIND OF PROGRESS THAT THEY WERE ON TRACK TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR THE PATH BACK TO U.K. POWER THEY NEEDED TO BE WINNING ONE HUNDREDS OF SEATS IN ENGLAND INSTEAD THEY'VE LOST A HANDFUL AND THAT MELTDOWN IN SCOTLAND BEING PUSHED INTO THIRD PLACE AS THINGS STAND LABOUR CAN WIN A GENERAL ELECTION UNLESS THEY WERE ON FIGHTING FORM
IN SCOTLAND SO THESE SETS OF RESULTS WILL NOT SILENCE HIS INTERNAL CRITICS WHAT IT HAS DONE IS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS M.P.S HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT THIS WOULD BE THE MOMENT TO GO OVER THE TOP TO STRIKE A SORT OF KAMIKAZE MISSION AND TRY TO TAKE JEREMY CORBIN OUT NOW MOST OF THEM CONCLUDED
BEFORE THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS THAT NOW WAS NOT THE TIME AND THAT'S VERY UNLIKELY WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANY KIND OF ACTION LIKE THAT THERE'LL BE NOISES OFF CERTAINLY WERE HEARING THOSE CONCERNS ALREADY THIS MORNING
BUT THIS BASICALLY RULES OUT ANY KIND OF STRAIGHT FOR OR AGAINST JEREMY CORBIN ANY TIME SOON JUST A QUICK ONE IF YOU WOULD OF COURSE WE HAVEN'T GOT A GOOD BIT OF NEWS FOR LABOUR WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE IN LONDON WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE WE DON'T KNOW COS THE COUNTY HASN'T BECOME SIDIQUE KHAN COULD WIN INDEED BECAUSE THIS SET OF ELECTIONS IS FAR FROM OVER THE COUNTING IS STILL GOING ON ALL IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
LABOUR WOULD BE SHOCKED IF THEY ARE MAN SAID IT DOES NOT REST CONTROL FROM LONDON CITY HOP FROM THE CONSERVATIVES OF LONDON'S CITY HALL NOW THAT IF YOU LIKE HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THE LIKELY SORT OF INSURANCE POLICY FOR JEREMY CORBIN IF THEY CAN WIN IN LONDON THAT WOULD BE A BIG
BOOST REAL FILLIP TO THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP THAT LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE THE RESULT WE SHOULD GET THAT LATE THIS AFTERNOON THE POLLS HAVE SHOWN THAT CONSISTENTLY HE'S FAR AHEAD MURMURS IT'LL BE TIGHTER THAN THE POLES HAVE SUGGESTED BUT NOBODY AT THIS POINT ALTHOUGH I THINK MOST OF THE LONDON TEAMS HAD BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES ARE STILL ASLEEP MOST NOBODY IS SUGGESTING THAT RESULT WILL BE A SHOCK BUT YOU BEEN SURPRISING RESULTS AND DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY YOU NEVER KNOW LOTS TO KEEP YOU AWAKE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY LAURA COULD PERFECT
AND IT IS SHE SPEAKS SOME RESULTS COMING IN IN WALES YOU KIP NOW ON FIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IN WALES WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE FORMER M.P. NEIL HAMILTON WHO IS HOPING TO TAKE ONE OF THOSE SEATS WILL BE TALKING TO NIGEL FARAGE UKIP LEADER AFTER EIGHT THIRTY TIME NOT TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND A FORMER SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE PRESS OFFICER HAS MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY CLAIM ABOUT THE FORCES' BEHAVIOUR DURING THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST
ANY COURT WAS EMPLOYED AS THE FORCES HILLSBOROUGH COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALIST JUST AFTER THE HEARINGS BEGAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN
I WAS TOLD MY VERY FIRST DAY EMPHATICALLY YOUR JOB IS TO ROUND THE MEDIA UP AT THE END OF THE DAY AND TELL THEM RIGHT GUYS THIS IS THE LIE
I TOOK THAT AS BEING THAT I WAS TO TELL THE MEDIA WHAT THEY WOULD BE REPORTING A DESPERATELY WANTED TO BELIEVE
THAT IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHEN I WAS ASKED A SECOND TIME AND THEN THE THIRD TIME AND EVENTUALLY A FOURTH TIME I REALISED THERE WASN'T A MISUNDERSTANDING THIS WAS WHAT I WAS BROUGHT IN TO DO
LET'S TALK TO SIR PETER FIVE HE WAS CHIEF CONSTABLE OF GREATER MANCHESTER POLICE ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST FORCE ISN'T TILL LAST YEAR GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THAT
I THINK IT JUST SHOWS THE WHOLE COMPLEXITY OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS NOW JUSTIN I CAN'T COMMENT ON THOSE PARTICULAR ALLEGATIONS AND NO DOUBT THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER THEY INCLUDE IN THEIR INVESTIGATION
BUT I THINK THE LAST SATURDAY DAVID COME WRITE A VERY GOOD ARTICLE IN THE GUARDIAN WORRY POINTED OUT HOW THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST HAD MOVED AWAY FROM A SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH INTO A BATTLE BETWEEN VARIOUS BARRISTERS AND HAD GOT CAUGHT INTO A VERY ADVERSARIAL PROCESS
THAT'S OFTEN WHAT IT FELT LIKE WHEN WHEN I WAS CHIEF CONSTABLE WHEN YOU MOVED INTO A NEW ORGANISATION YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH LOTS OF ISSUES FROM THE HISTORY WHERE PEOPLE OFTEN ARE VERY ENTRENCHED VIEWS YOU'RE GETTING ADVICE FROM THE FORCES LAWYERS FROM THE PRESS PEOPLE YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICIANS WHO NOW HAVE A GREATER INVOLVEMENT IN PUBLIC SERVICES AND OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT TO THE VIEWS OF THE FAMILIES INVOLVED BUT ALSO YOUR OWN STAFF AS A LEADER YOU HAVE TO TRY AND MAKE IT NAVIGATE YOUR WAY THROUGH THERE WELL BUT BUT EXACTLY AS AS
AS A LEADER AND AS A FORCE AS A POLICE FORCE YOU NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS DON'T YOU ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT AND IF WHAT SHE IS SUGGESTING IS TRUE THAT SHE WAS TOLD SHE SHOULD BE STRESSING EVIDENCE GIVEN BY WITNESSES WHO SUGGESTED THAT SUPPORTERS ACTUALLY DID MISBEHAVE IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING IN SPITE OF WHAT WAS KNOWN ALREADY IN SPITE OF THE PREVIOUS HISTORY AS ONE OF THE FACT THE FORCE HAD ALREADY APOLOGISED THAT DOES SEEM BIZARRE
AND OF COURSE THE WHOLE BIZARRE THING ABOUT THE HILLSBOROUGH CASES THAT THE TAYLOR REPORT WAY BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE NINETEEN NINETY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE FORCE HAD MADE FAILINGS AND THE FANS WERE NOT TO BLAME BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE WIDER ISSUES HERE ABOUT HOW IT'S EASY TO SAY BIG FORCE MUST DO THE RIGHT THING AND LEADERS MUST DO THE RIGHT THING I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT POSITION AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
HAS DEVELOPED INTO SUCH AN ADVERSARIAL PROCESS THAT THE BALANCE AS WE GOT THE BALANCE WRONG AND TWO OFF AND THERE WAS A PROGRAMME ON RADIO FOUR EARLIER THIS WEEK ABOUT THE BLAME CULTURE WE HAVE TO TRY AND FIND A WAY WHEREBY WE CAN HOLD PUBLIC SERVICE TO ACCOUNT WOULD THINGS GO WRONG BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS ABOUT THE SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH AND IT IS ABOUT TRYING CRUCIALLY TO LEARN LESSONS IN MY EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH MANY FAMILIES WHO'VE SUFFERED TRAGEDIES OFTEN AS A RESULT OF
POLICE ACTION BUT CRUCIALLY WHAT THEY WANTED WAS THEY WANTED AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WANTED REASSURANCE IT COULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND THE TROUBLE IS OFTEN WITH BIG LEGAL PROCESSES INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS WHICH CAN TAKE MANY MANY YEARS AND THAT ALL GETS IN THE WAY OF THE FAMILY GETTING THAT SATISFACTION AND I SOCIAL SOME YEARS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE FAMILIES INVOLVED AT THE CENTRE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE WORRY ABOUT THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE FORCE THAT WILL BE THAT A CULTURE
THAT GOES RIGHT BACK TO THE MINERS' STRIKES EARNINGS UP JUST ABOUT HILLS HIM ABOUT OTHER THINGS AS WELL THAT THAT CULTURE THAT SENSE OF US AGAINST THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT ACTUALLY HASN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH THAT WAS A FEATURE PARTICULAR OF POLICING IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT I DON'T THINK IT JUST EXISTS IN POLICE FORCES AT THE MOMENT IS ACROSS THE PUBLIC SECTOR BUT DOES IT STILL EXIST IN PLACE WHAT
AND I DON'T THINK THE CULTURE OF THEM AND US EXIST SIMPLY SOURCES IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PUBLIC BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HOW YOU DEAL WITH SITUATIONS WHEN YOUR ORGANISATION HAS MADE A MISTAKE WHEN SOME OF YOUR STAFF HAVE HER FAILED IS EVER MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX WE SEE IN THE HEALTH SERVICE OFTEN HAS DIFFICULTY IN ADMITTING THAT THINGS HAVE GONE WRONG WE SEE OFTEN IN POLITICS THE POLITICIANS SOMETIMES HAVE DIFFICULTY IT SEEMS
ADMITTING THAT PARTICULAR POLICY HASN'T WORKED AND IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT THE BALANCE RIGHT BETWEEN HOLDING PEOPLE TO ACCOUNT AND AS I SAY GIVE IT GIVING ORGANISATIONS INDIVIDUALS THE ROOM TO SAY WE LIVE IN A COMPLEX WORLD AND SOMETIMES MISTAKES ARE MADE NOT EDIBLE WITH IS THE LONGER THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND CASES TAKE ON THEM PEOPLE COME MORE ENTRENCHED AND THE TREES GETS LAST THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF HOW YOU ALLOW ORGANISATIONS TO REFORM THEMSELVES ISN'T THAT WE WERE HEARING FROM LORD BLUNKETT THE FORMER LABOUR HOME SECRETARY AND OF COURSE THAT CHEF AND THEN P. AS HE ONCE WAS
WEEKS GO ON THIS PROGRAMME HE WAS HE WAS WORRIED FOR THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE FORCE ACTUALLY WORRIED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO TO DELIVER POLICING TO THE PEOPLE OF THE AREA IF THERE WERE TOO MANY INQUIRIES AND THINGS OVER THEIR HEADS IN YEARS TO COME BUT ON THE OTHER HAND OTHER PEOPLE SAYING WELL ACTUALLY THE FOUR SHOULD BE DISBANDED THE YOU CAN'T REFORM IT EVERYWHERE HOW DO WE APPROACH THE PRACTICAL QUESTION OF TURNING THAT POLICE FORCE ROUND
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE WE'RE NOT SERVING AT THE TIME OF HILLS AND EVERY DAY TRY AND DO THE VERY BEST FOR THAT FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE AND THERE WILL BE LOTS OF ADVICE FROM THE HOME OFFICE THE COLLEGE OF POLICING THE INSPECTORATE AND TO HELP BEFORE SKATE THROUGH THIS BUT I DO THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE WIDER ISSUES
AS I SAY ABOUT HOW PUBLIC ORGANISATIONS DEAL WITH THESE SORTS OF CASES AND ABSOLUTELY AS LORD BUNKERS POINTED OUT IF IT BECOMES TOO ADVERSARIAL TO CONDEMN MAY TREE IT'S TOO MUCH FOR BLAME CULTURE IT IS MUCH HARDER FOR THOSE ORGANISATIONS TO MOVE FORWARD AND AS SAY PARTICULARLY MUCH HARDER TO LEARN THE LESSONS AND FOR PEOPLE TO ADMIT WHEN THEY'VE MADE MISTAKES TOO OR GREED FOR INSTANCE A PUBLIC INQUIRY OR NOT DO YOU THINK
I THINK IF PEOPLE WANT TO LOOK AT ORGREAVE YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT IT IN A MUCH WIDER CONTEXT OF THE POLICING OF THE MINERS' STRIKE AND HOW AN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE WAS POLICED IN THAT WAY BY A GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PREVIOUS MINERS' STRIKE I THINK WILL BE COMPLETELY UNFAIR JUST TO FOCUSING ON THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS OF OF INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS IMAGE SHOULD BE ABOUT TRYING TO WHY WAS THE POLICE HORSE USED IN THAT WAY AND I WAS A YOUNG OFFICER AT THAT TIME IT FELT THE TIMES LIKE WE WERE AN OCCUPATION IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE
SO ALMOST IN THE ARMY AND WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S TOTALLY AGAINST THE STYLE OF BRITISH POLICING AND AT THE TIME IT FELT MORE AKIN TO WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER REGIMES AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED OR GRIEF HAS TO BE SEEN IN THAT CONTEXT OF HOW WAS AN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE POLICED IN THAT WAY

BUT IN ENGLAND AND WALES WERE DOING WELL AND WE'RE ALSO HOPEFUL OR WINNING A SEAT OR TWO IN THE NORTHERN IRISH ASSEMBLY INSTALLMENT AND IT WAS REPORTED WHEN NEIL HAMILTON THE FORMER M.P. CONSERVATIVE M.P. WAS CHOSEN AS A CANDIDATE IN WALES THAT YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT VERY MUCH WHAT WHAT'S THE STATE OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP NOW WITH THE WHALES PARTY AND INDEED WITH HIM HERE WE DON'T YET KNOW WHETHER HE'S

BUT IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND NOW IN THE BIG CITIES IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND UKIP IS NOW THE OPPOSITION TO LABOUR AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IN THIS REFERENDUM UKIP HAVE GOT A VERY BIG JOB TO PLAY IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND TO GET THOSE VOTERS TO TURN OUT AND VOTE FOR REX
NIGEL FARAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH KIT TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO KNOW A LITTLE BREAK FROM THE ELECTION HE CITY OF MARSEILLE ON FRANCE'S MEDITERRANEAN COAST IS RENOWNED FOR ITS DIVERSITY A PLACE WHERE JEWS AND MUSLIMS CHRISTIANS AND ATHEISTS ALL RUB SHOULDERS TOGETHER
IN THE LATEST TEST OF TOLERANCE A SYNAGOGUE IN THE CITY CENTRE IS BEING SOLD TO A MUSLIM ORGANISATION WHICH PLANS TO TURN IT INTO A MOSQUE A PARIS CORRESPONDENT LUCY WILLIAMSON HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING WHAT THE UNUSUAL SALE MEANS FOR RELATIONS THERE NOW
MARSEILLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PLACE OF SECOND CHANCES
ROUND THE BACK OF THE OLD PORT WHERE MANY NORTH AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS GOT THEIR FIRST FEW OF FRANCE IS A TINY YOUTH CENTRE
THE CITY'S MOST TROUBLED BOYS ARE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE UP POOL IN PLACE OF PETTY CRIME
SITTING IN A DECKCHAIR ON THE STREET OUTSIDE
THEIR YOUTH WORKER SA TELLS ME MOST OF THE BOYS IN THE PROGRAMME
BUT IN THE MELTING POT THAT IS MARSEILLE HE SUGGESTS NO ONE NOTICES THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S COS A BUSKER MARSEILLE IS A TOWN OF IMMIGRATION IT HAS THE LARGEST PORT IN FRANCE FOR CENTURIES IT'S WELCOME DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND WE ALL LIVED TOGETHER VERY WELL HERE IN THE SOUTH THERE'S THE SUN THERE'S THAT WE'RE NOT STRESSED THERE'S NO RACISM DOWN HERE BUT ONLY BY THAT
BUT THERE IS CHANGE AND A FEW FEET AWAY AT THE END OF THE STREET IS ONE POWERFUL SIGN OF IT
THIS NONDESCRIPT BUILDING ON THE CORNER OF A TINY MARSEILLES STREET USED TO BE THE ODDS WHORE A SYNAGOGUE IT'S YELLOW WALLS COVERED IN GRAFFITI NOW ITS DOORS SHUTTERED THIS USED TO BE THE HEART OF A THRIVING JEWISH COMMUNITY
BUT AS THOSE JEWISH FAMILIES BECAME MORE SUCCESSFUL HERE THEY MOVED TO OTHER WEALTHIER PARTS OF MARSEILLES AND IN THEIR PLACE HAVE COME MUSLIM FAMILIES
WHICH IS WHY THE CITY'S CHIEF RABBI REUBEN A HANNAH HAS GIVEN HIS PERMISSION FOR THE OLD SYNAGOGUE TO BE SOLD TO A CONSERVATIVE MUSLIM ORGANISATION WHICH PLANS TO TURN IT INTO A MOSQUE
THEY SKI GEAR I THINK THAT'S MORE STUBBORN GIVE PHILIP YES YOU OF COURSE THE DECISION TO CLOSE IT NEEDED CAREFUL THOUGHT BUT IT HAS TO CLOSE IT'S BETTER TO SELL IT AND JUST LEAVE IT EMPTY AND IT'S GOING TO BE SOLD BETTER THAT IT BECOME A PLACE OF PRAYER THAN A SHOP OR A NIGHTCLUB
HAS BECOME A BYWORD FOR DIVERSITY AND COEXISTENCE WITH THE TAIL OF THIS SMALL LOCAL SYNAGOGUE IS ALSO THE STORY OF A WIDER SEPARATION ACCORDING TO SOCIOLOGIST VINCENT GUESS
BECOMING A DIVISION MEN USUALLY EVA DOESN'T MEN GATTI EDGES BEVAN DEFINITELY OLD MIXED COMMUNITIES HAVE DISAPPEARED JEWS AND MUSLIMS LIVE PEACEFULLY BUT SEPARATELY QUALITY IT'S SAD TO SAY THAT THE ONLY COMMON AIR IS NOW THE COMMERCIAL AREAS LIKE THE ONE BIG SHOPPING STREET WHERE THE YOUNG COME TO BUY FASHION ON SATURDAYS IT'S AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT MARSEILLE THESE DAYS AS A TOWN OF BROTHERHOOD THAT'S A MYTH IT'S A FAIRYTALE
ROUND THE CORNER FROM THE OLD SYNAGOGUE IS THERE BELOW MOSQUE RUN BY IMAM MOOSE EQUITY IT'S ONE OF ONE HUNDRED OR SO LOCAL PRAYER HOLDS THAT SERVE THE CITY BUT THIS WILLING MUSLIM POPULATION HERE ESTIMATED AT AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HAS OUTGROWN THEM
EVERY FRIDAY HE REFUSED PEOPLE
MORE DID HUNDRED PEOPLE
DUST AWAY BUT WE CAN CHANGE THE MUSKY WE NEEDED THEN
BECAUSE DEAD I'M ABOUT IS COMING AND THE PEDAL THAT'S ME YEAH WE NEED AUSPICIOUS WE NEED HINDI C.D. MUST SAY WE NEED TIM TELLS A BLISS
SAY SMALLER JEWISH COMMUNITY HAS BEEN STAGNANT FOR YEARS BUT IT'S ALSO FINDING IT NEEDS MORE SPACE TO PRAY
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE ATTACKS IN PARIS LAST YEAR ORDER
BYE BYE AH HA NA BROADCAST OF RADIO PROGRAMME TO THE CITY'S FAITHFUL AND HE SAYS THAT IN PLACE OF THE TWO SYNAGOGUES THAT HAVE CLOSED INCLUDING OR TORAH HE'S BUILT FIVE NEW ONES
BUT IT COULD HAVE COMMUNITY I WAS NOT SORT OF HAWICK UTTERLY AT THE COMMUNITY FEELS THE NEED TO GATHER WHEN IT'S BEEN ATTACKED AND JEWS FEEL THAT THEY'RE A TARGET THE LIVING UNDER THE THREAT OF TERRORISM MORE AND MORE PARENTS SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO JEWISH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY CENTRES TO PROTECT THEM AND PEOPLE HAVE A SPIRITUAL THIRST MORE THAN EVER THESE DAYS SO WE NEED MORE SYNAGOGUES
COS I'M PRETTY
THE COMMUNITY CENTRE THAT'S AMIR SAYS THAT FOR MUSLIMS THE ATTACKS HAVE SIMPLY LEAD TO MORE PREJUDICE
WHEN WE GO INTO THE WEALTHIER AREAS OF THE CITY THESE DAYS HE SAYS YOU DON'T FEEL WELCOME
JOB ABUSES YOU SOME EAR SAYS HE HAS SEVERAL JEWISH FRIENDS BUT IDENTITIES HERE ARE CHANGE
RELIGION IS BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT AND THE ISRAELI PALESTINIAN CONFLICT JUST ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN CONTINUES TO DIVIDE
HE HE WAS
MERE GESTURES INSIDE TO WHERE THE POOL GAME IS LEADING TO AN ARGUMENT
WE CAN TALK TO THEM HE SAYS THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL WHAT THEY PICK UP FROM THE INTERNET AND POETICAL ISATION IS A BIGGIE
LUCY WILLIAMS AND REPORTING IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT MORNINGS LIKE THIS WE ALL TURN TO THE ELECTIONS GURU THE COUNTRY'S LEADING FOLLOW APOLOGIST THE PROF OF COURSE PROFESSOR JOHN CURTIS WHO JOINED US ON THE LINE
MORNINGS YOU'VE BEEN A LONG NIGHT FOR YOU ALREADY JOHN HASN'T IT JUST LET'S BEGIN WITH SCOTLAND CAN WE MEAN WHAT MATTERS FIRST AND FOREMOST AS YOU'VE GOVERNED SCOTLAND THE S.N.P. WINNING WELL BUT YOUR FORECAST IS THAT THEY WILL NOT DO IT WITH ANOTHER MAJORITY GOVERNMENT THAT'S RIGHT IN A SENSE THE S.N.P. HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF RATHER HIGH EXPECTATIONS THE OPINION POLLS HAVE MISS ADJUSTING THE PARTY WOULD GET A CERTAINLY OVERALL MAJORITY POSSIBLY MORE THAN THE SIXTY NINE SEATS THAT THEY'VE GOT FIVE YEARS AGO IN THE END THEY FIND THEY ARE LIKELY TO HAVE SIXTY THREE SEATS
AND WILL BE A MINORITY ADMINISTRATION THAT SAID THE TRUTH IS I DON'T ANYBODY EXPECTS THE S.N.P. TO HAVE THAT MUCH TROUBLE GOVERNING NORTH OF THE BORDER NOT LEASE THERE ARE GOING TO BE A HALF A DOZEN OR SO GREEN M.S.P.S AND THEY WERE BACKED THE S.N.P. ON MAY DAY THOUGH NOT ON THE CRUCIAL ISSUE OF TAXATION BUT CERTAINLY THE S. AND P. NO HAVE A SMALLER VOTE THAN THEY HAD IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IN THAT SPECTACULAR SEX THE WESTMINSTER LECTURE AND I THINK THERE'LL BE SOMETHING OF AN AIR OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN NATIONAL CIRCLES THIS MORNING
HOW SIGNIFICANT WAS THE BATTLE FOR SECOND PLACE CLEARLY IT MATTERS IN SCOTLAND BUT DOES THE FACT THE LABOUR HAVE COME THIRD HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION FOR THE U.K. GOVERNMENT WHAT IT CERTAINLY MEANS THAT THE LABOUR PARTY ARE EVEN FURTHER AWAY FROM RECOVERING FROM THE DISASTER THAT THEY HAD TWELVE MONTHS AGO THEM THAN THEY PREVIOUSLY WERE LABOUR'S VOTES FALLEN YET FURTHER IN SCOTLAND
AND THE TRUTH IS THAT UNLESS THE LABOUR PARTY CAN REGAIN GROUND OF SCOTLAND COULD START WINNING SEATS IN SCOTLAND IT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR LABOUR PARTY TO WIN AN OVERALL MAJORITY OF NEXT LECTURE ME EVEN LEAVING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF BOUNDARY CHANGES WHICH ARE COMING DOWN THE TRACK IF LABOUR'S HAS TO RELY ON WINNING SEATS IN ENGLAND ALONE IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE AND A HALF POINTS AHEAD OF THE CONSERVATIVES
TO WIN A MAJORITY AND ALTHOUGH THE LABOUR PARTY MADE SOME PROGRESS IN THE ENGLISH COUNCIL ACTION CERTAINLY AS COMPARED WITH TWELVE MONTHS AGO PROBABLY MADE RATHER MORE PROGRESS THAN WAS ANTICIPATED BY THE OPINION POLLS WERE CERTAINLY NOT LOOKING AT A PERFORMANCE LO PARTY IN ENGLAND ROOM LOOKING REMOTELY ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THE TRUTH IS THAT WHILE MISTER CORBIN HAS PROBABLY GOT A BIT OF BREATHING SPACE THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE ENGLISH COUNCIL RESULTS OF NOT BEING QUITE AS BAD AS WHERE I ANTICIPATED
LABOUR ARE STILL HAVE AN AWFUL AWFUL LOT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE THEY LOOK LIKE A PARTY THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO WIN HER FOUR YEARS TO A QUICK ONE ON TWO THINGS HAVE THIRTY SECONDS EACH IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY JOHN REFERENDUM IN SCOTLAND AS THE FACT THAT THE S. M. P. WHERE DIDN'T DO QUITE AS WELL AS SOME FORECAST MAKE IT LESS LIKELY WE'LL GET ANOTHER REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE
I THINK CERTAINLY THE S. AND MARK MAY HAVE A NOTE FROM THE RESORTS THAT ACTUALLY WHERE THEY ABOVE ALL LOST IN THOSE PARTS OF SCOTLAND THAT VOTED NO EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO AND THEREFORE MAY BE TALKING ABOUT UNIVERSITIES THE PARTY ANY GOOD BUT OF COURSE WE SHOULD REMEMBER THE GREENS ARE IN PRINCIPLE IN FAVOUR OF INDEPENDENCE SO IF THERE WERE TO BE ATTACKED BY THE S.N.P. TO HOLD A SECOND REFERENDUM THEY PROBABLY WOULD STILL HAVE THE VOTES IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT AND JUST AS BRIEF IF YOU WOULD THE TORY SLIPPING BACK IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND SHOULD THAT WORRY CAMERON AHEAD OF THE EURO REFERENDUM DOES IT
OF WHAT MIGHT COME I PROBABLY PUT IT THE OTHER WAY ROUND I WOULD SAY THE RATHER MODEST CONSERVED PERFORMANCE THERE SAY THIS THIS OVERNIGHT PERFORMANCE THAT FRANKLY IS ALMOST AS BAD AS THE TWENTY TWELVE PERFORMANCE FALLING GEORGE OSBORNE'S OBVIOUS SHAMBLES BUDGET IS IN PART A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT THE ELECTORATE HAVE NOW I NOTICED THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS ALSO SPLIT AND THEREFORE TO SOME DEGREE OFF PUT IT IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS LABOUR MAYBE NOT WORTH SUPPORTING JOHN CURTIS TO THEIR SECOND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
FORTY MINUTES TO NINE NOW SHOULD WE WELCOME THE ERA OF DRIVERLESS CARS WE ARE GOING TO GET THEM PRETTY SOON WE ARE TOLD AND ALREADY SEMI AUTOMATION IS HERE AS WE WERE HEARING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME TESSLER HAVE A SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR THEIR TOP RANGE CARS THAT ALLOWS THIS
RIGHT WE'RE OUT ON THE MOTORWAY NOW AND WE'RE DOING SIXTY MILES AN HOUR AND I WOULD LIKE SOME HELP DRIVING TELL ME WHAT TO DO IF YOU PRESS THE STORM
OR DO YOU TWICE
IT WILL ENABLE AUTISTIC AND TRATH QUICKIES CONTROL O.K. I'M GOING TO DO THAT
HAPPENED OH IT'S A REALLY STRANGE FEEL
BECAUSE THE WHEEL IS NOW MOVING I'VE GOT MY HANDS ON IT I HASTEN TO ADD BUT THE WHEELERS MOVING
WE'VE SLOWED DOWN BECAUSE AS A CAR IN FRONT OF US
AND WE HAVE SLOWED TOO
MOOMIN SAFELY BEHIND IT I'VE GOT MY FEET ARE NOTHING NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR AND NOT ON THE BRAKE
I'VE GOT MY HANDS ON THE WHEEL BUT THE WILL HAS REALLY GOT A MIND OF ITS OWN IS QUITE A STRONG PAUL IT'S DOING WHAT IT THINKS WHAT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP US RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LANE AND I'M ACTUALLY DOING AT THE MOMENT NOTHING
WHICH IS A STRANGE STRANGE FEELING BECAUSE WE ARE DOING WELL WE WERE DOING SIXTY WHEN ADDING FIFTY MILES AN HOUR
STRANGE OR NOT HE'S HAD A FEELING WE ARE GOING TO GET USED TO CHRISTIAN WILMA'S AUTHOR AND HER TRANSPORT EXPERT AND ON THE LINE PROFESSOR PAUL NEWMAN WHO LEAVES THE MOBILE ROBOTICS GROUP AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING MORNING CHRISTIAN YOU'RE A SCEPTIC YES I MEAN I'D TAKE ISSUE WITH WHAT YOU SAID IN THE INTRODUCTION THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO COME SOON AT THE BIG PROBLEM IS NOT HAVING DRIVER AIDS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE SUBJECT TO I DON'T THINK YOU ENJOYED THE EXPERIENCE VERY MUCH FROM THE SOUND OF IT
BUT THEN IT'S A BIG STEP TOWARDS HAVING ACTUALLY FULLY DRIVERLESS CARS THAT COULD SAY TAKE YOU TO WORK AND THEN GO OFF AND TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL NO I'LL TAKE HER FOR A CAR THAT COULD HAVE TAKEN IT ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE I WAS ON THE M. FOUR ARE GOING TO TAKE ME RIGHT TO THE END OF THE M. FOUR AND I NEED NOT HAVE DONE ANYTHING THAT IS QUITE THAT IS THAT IS CERTAINLY PROGRESS BUT IT'S PROGRESS IN TERMS OF DRIVER AIDS BUT
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CARS THE GOOGLE CARS FOR EXAMPLE THEY STRUGGLE ENORMOUSLY IN HEAVY RAIN AND I'M ALSO TOLD THAT THEY WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT DRIVING SNOW BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH IN SAN FRANCISCO WOULD BE TESTED THAT MUCH SO WE ARE VERY LONG WAY OFF FROM THIS AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD NOT BE KEPT TRIED TO WORK OUT TRANSPORT POLICY IN RELATION TYPISTS O.K. PAUL NEWMAN I WEAR A LONG WAY OFF
IT'S NEW WANTS I MEAN HAVING A VEHICLE THAT CAN GO FORM ANY PLACE TO ANY OTHER PLACE WHENEVER YOU WANT IN WHATEVER THE WEATHER IS A LONG TIME COMING HAVING VEHICLES THAT CAN DRIVE US IN SOME OF THE LOCATIONS FULLY AUTONOMOUSLY IS GOING TO HAPPEN SOON SO YOU AND I WOULD AGREE THAT IT'S A TRICKY PROBLEM I WOULD AGREE THAT IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE MANY AREAS OF INDUSTRY
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE WORK ON THIS BUT WE SHOULD STAY POSITIVE ABOUT IT I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT MEDICAL ADVANCES AND WE SAY THAT WE WILL BE WORKING ON CURING CANCER WE DON'T ASK WHAT DAY WILL IT BE ARRIVING WE SAY WE'RE WORKING ON IT AND THINGS GETTING BETTER THE WHOLE TIME SO I'M VERY POSITIVE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY I DON'T KNOW I FELT SLIGHTLY UNSAFE PONY WHO WAS THAT JUST ME I MEAN IT ONCE WHERE USED TO IT IT DID DES WHAT
THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE SUGGESTS THAT ACTUALLY THE COMPUTER THE MACHINE IS SAFER THAN THE FALLIBLE DRIVER WELL YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DISTRACT A COMPUTER SO IF NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF ROAD ACCIDENTS ARE CAUSED BY HUMANS BEING DISTRACTED THAT'S ONE THING MACHINES DON'T GET HE'S DISTRACTED
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE THINGS WHERE WHERE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE HAS AMAZING PERCEPTION SO SPOTTING A PLASTIC BAG IS EMPTY AS IT'S BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD THAT'S HARD BUT I THINK THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WHEN YOU WERE LEARNING TO JOE I PRESUME YOU CAN DRIVE WHEN YOU WERE LEARNING TO DRIVE IT WAS A LONELY EXPERIENCE IT WAS JUST YOU BY YOURSELF LEARNING TO DRIVE AND HE HAD TO SPEND YEARS GETTING BETTER
THIS ISN'T TRUE FOR MACHINES THAT DRIVE BECAUSE FOR EVERY INCIDENT THEY HAVE THAT DATA CAN BE SHARED THAT EXPERIENCE CAN BE REFINED AND ALL THE VEHICLES LEARN TO DRIVE BETTER BECAUSE OF THAT THAT AN EXTRAORDINARY THING CHRISTIAN WELL THAT IN THERE IN THE MEANTIME THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE DRIVERS WORSE BECAUSE IF THE CAR IS DRIVING A LOT OF THE TIME AND YOU'VE ACCEPTED THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO FULLY AUTONOMOUS CARS FOR A VERY LONG TIME
IF IT'S DRIVING A LOT OF THE TIME YOU GET DE SKILLED IN THE SAME WAY THAT A LOT OF ACCIDENTS THESE DAYS ARE CALLS BECAUSE THE PILOTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY FLYING THE PLAY MUCH OF THE TIME AND SO WHEN THEN INCIDENT HAPPENS THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT SO THERE MAY ACTUALLY AN ADDED SAFETY RISK DOING THEIR SORT OF INTERIM PERIOD WHICH MIGHT BE VERY LONG WITH THOSE BOTH DRIVERLESS CARS AND NOT WHEN I WAS BORN IN AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT ARGUMENT WAS PUT THROUGH IN THE TRANSITION FROM HORSES TO CART AS WELL IN NONE OF US CAN RIDE HORSES THAT WAS
VERY FEW OF US CAN THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT WAS PUT FORWARD NO I SAY NO THAT'S I MY STATION IN EVERY TRANSITION FOR HER NEW TECHNOLOGY SKILLS CHANGE THAT'S WHAT TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM THOUGH PAUL NEWMAN THAT SOMETIMES THESE CARS TO DO FAIL SOMETHING GOES WRONG OR SOMETHING IT DOESN'T WANT TO COPE WITH IT THEN SAYS TO YOU YOU'RE IN CHARGE AND IF YOU'RE NOT IF YOU WERE DOING SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU HAD YOUR EYES CLOSED WHICH I QUITE EASILY COULD HAVE DONE ON THE M. FOUR THEN AT SIXTY MILES AN HOUR NEAR SLOUGH WOULD SAY I DIDN'T BUT I HAD A GUN
THEN YOU COULD BE IN REAL TROUBLE RIGHT AND THIS ISN'T A TECHNOLOGY YOU'RE GOING AND BUYING IN SALESROOMS NOW THIS IS AN EVOLVING TEN I DON'T KNOW THE TEST BUT DIFFERENT SO THAT BURNT HERE'S THE POINT THERE PAUL TELLS LACEY SAY OR WE DON'T ADVISE YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP YOUR HANDS ON THE WHALE BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S A SORT OF NUDGE NUDGE WINK WINK THING GOING ON WITH THE INDUSTRY MORE GENERALLY I DON'T WHAT WAS BEHIND THE SCENES VIEWERS AND BUT ACTUALLY YOU CAN IF YOU WANT
RIGHT SO I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON THERE IS THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE SOME LEGAL ISSUES HERE THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES ABOUT THE HANDOVER BETWEEN A MACHINE TO A HUMAN AND THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING A VEHICLE THAT I CAN GO ANYWHERE ANY TIME THAT'S A LONG TIME OFF BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE VEHICLES THAT WORK IN AREAS THAT THEY'RE VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT THESE MACHINES SO THERE ARE ISSUES HERE THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FULL AUTONOMY AND SOMETHING THAT KEEPS YOU AND ELAINE AND STOPS YOU REAR ENDING THE CAR IN FRONT THAT'S A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S ALL PART OF THIS BLENDED SPECTRUM TOWARDS MACHINES
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE CAN MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CARS I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S ABOUT EVERY MACHINE IN WAREHOUSES FORKLIFTS MINING AGRICULTURE IT'S THE SAME TECHNOLOGY QUESTION SO YOU BASICALLY ACCEPTED THAT WE'RE A VERY LONG WAY AWAY FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IT THOUGH IT WON'T BE EVERYWHERE SO THAT IS THE WAY THAT WE DID THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT IT IS THAT WE'VE BEEN SOLD THIS TECHNOLOGY IS AN IDEA THAT YOU CAN
WOULD BE DRIVEN TO WORK WITH THE FINANCIAL TIMES IN THE BACK SEAT AND THEY SEND A VEHICLE OFF TO GO TAKE YOUR KIDS AWAY A VERY VERY LONG WAY AWAY FROM BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS WHICH IS WHICH THE TECHNOLOGISTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY ANSWERING IS WHAT IS THIS FOR WHY ARE WE TRYING TO DO THIS WHAT ADVANTAGE WOULD IT GIVE US AND UNTIL IT'S ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OR TOM IT WAS THERE ISN'T VERY MUCH ADVANTAGE IN THAT REALLY O.K. JUSTIN YOU COULD GO TO SLEEP ON THE M. FOUR I WAS SLIGHTLY WORRIED ABOUT THAT
BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY CHANGE OUR LIVES VERY MUCH AND MORE OVER HE MIGHT JUST ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO USE THEIR CARS INSTEAD OF SAY PUBLIC TRANSPORT CHRISTIAN AND PAUL NEWMAN THANKS BOTH VERY MUCH IT IS A SUBJECT WE WILL FOR CERTAIN BECOMING BACK
SIX MINUTES DENYING THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN BUT WHAT ON EARTH THAT THEY MADE AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY WHAT WILL POLITICIANS IN WESTMINSTER HOLYROOD CARDIFF AND ELSEWHERE I THINK THEY MEANT TO DO ABOUT IT TO DISCUSS THAT WE'RE JOINED BY ANEESHA ASTANA POLITICAL EDITOR OF THE GUARDIAN KATE DEVLIN NEWS OF THEIR HERALD IN GLASGOW SHE'S THE U.K. POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT SCOTTISH DAILY PAPER AND EMMA COWBOY SENIOR EDITOR AT THE ECONOMY'S DOWN FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE MANY CORBIN SUPPORTERS THEY'RE TWEETING IN THE TEXT
WHY ARE YOU PRESENTING THIS AS A DISASTER FOR THE LABOUR PARTY IT WASN'T WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PARTY LEADERSHIP WILL REALLY THINK IN THEIR BONES AND M.P.S ABOUT THIS SET OF RESULTS I THINK THEY'LL TELL THEMSELVES THAT AS A SNAPSHOT OF HOW THE COUNTRY WAS FEELING IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE THERE LOT OF PEOPLE INSIDE THE PARTY ON THE RIGHT OF THE PARTY THING A LOSER UNDREDS OF SEATS IS GOING TO BE ARMAGEDDON
BUT IF YOU SEE IT AS A WAY POSTER ARE YOU GETTING TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO TO AND WHAT IS IT THAT YOU NEED MORE TIME TO DO THEN I THINK THAT THE MESSAGE IT IS STILL RATHER BLEAK FOR MYSTICAL AND BECAUSE THAT COMBINATION YOU ALLUDED IT TO THEN TO IT
SCOTLAND SHALL COME ONTO I'M SURE AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE IN SCOTLAND REALLY GOING BACKWARDS IN SCOTLAND AND NOT MOVING FORWARDS AND ENGLAND IT EDDIE SENSE THAT LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ALREADY CALLED KNIGHTS OR GETTING TO KNOW AND GETTING TO LIKE HIM MORE ANOUCHKA IT IS OFTEN THE ISSUE ISN'T IT WITH THESE LECTURES WHAT DOES IT SAY TO PEOPLE TEMPTED TO MOVE AGAINST THEIR LEADER WHAT WILL THIS SAY TO THEM
WELL IT WILL SAY DON'T MOVE AGAINST HIM TODAY THIS IS NOT D. DAY FOR JEREMY CORBIN BUT IT IS NOT BIASED NICK TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF TALK IN WESTMINSTER ABOUT PLOTS
AND MANOEUVRES LOTS OF M.P.S WANT TO REMOVE JEREMY CORBIN FROM POST WHAT THEY'VE GOT TODAY IS A LITTLE BIT OF EVIDENCE THAT ACTUALLY IS HE REALLY ON TRACK TOWARDS TWENTY TWENTY BUT THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED THAT SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACT AND THAT IS THAT THE MEMBERS STILL BACK HIM IN A MAJORITY WHEN TOM WATSON SAYS PATIENTS HE SAID TO ME THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT I PUT IT TO HIM OTHER PEOPLE THINK YOU SAYING NOT JUST YET WAIT
MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT I TALK TO IN WESTMINSTER WHO WANT TO SEE JEREMY CORBIN GONE THAT IS EXACTLY THE MESSAGE THAT THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY IT'S NOT YET
DEVLIN FROM THE HERALD THERE'S A WIDER SIGNIFICANCE FOR U.K. POLITICS OF THIS RESULT IN SCOTLAND AS WELL ISN'T IT NOT JUST ABOUT LABOUR'S CAPACITY TO WIN A GENERAL ELECTION IF THEY CAN'T RECOVER THERE BUT ALSO IT TELLS US THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A RERUN OF THAT ELECTION CAMPAIGN OFF LABOUR CAN ONLY GET INTO POWER IF THEY GET INTO BED WITH THE S.N.P.
YES I'D SAY THEY AND LABOUR OF THE INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED BY WHAT LOOKS LIKE GOING BACKWARDS IN SCOTLAND AND IT LOOKS AS IF THEY SEE THE VOTERS BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF TWO VERY BIG FESTIVAL AT SLIGHTLY CONFUSED MESSAGE ON WHERE THEY STAND ON INDEPENDENCE SUCH BEEN EXPLOITED BY THE CONSERVATIVES AND SECONDLY AND THIS IS
MORE OF A PROBLEM FOR JEREMY CORA BEND THE LEGS THEY DID HAVE A LEFT WING AGENDA IN THIS ELECTION AND IT LOOKS AS IF IT'S BEEN REJECTED BY THE PHOTO THUMBTACKS ON TRIDENT AND SO YES AND MANY OF THE CANDIDATES ONE THAT ACTUALLY IT'S UM WRONG POLICY BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENED IS
S.N.P. HAS SEWN UP THOSE TRADITIONAL WORKING CLASS LABOUR VOTES AND THEY'RE LOSING TO MIDDLE CLASS VOTERS HE DON'T LIKE JEREMY CORBIN IN TRUTH HUGELY SIGNIFICANT THESE RESULTS FOR WHO GOVERNS US IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BUT VERY QUICKLY THE WESTMINSTER BECAUSE THAT'S SIMPLY MOVE ON TO THE REFERENDUM WHAT THEY KNOW NOT ANYTHING YOU'RE SEEING IN THESE RESULTS THAT SAYS THAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING AND HOUSED THE COUNTRY VOTES COME THE ENERGY
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERN OF VOTING IAN WHO IS ABLE TO TO GET THEIR THEIR VOTE OUT YOU CERTAINLY SAFER YOU KEEP THEY'D BE VERY HAPPY THERE THEY KNOW THEIR PRESENCE IN IN WALES ONE OR TWO BUT IT'S GOOD ENOUGH YOU COULD NEED FOOT HOLDS THEY NEED PLACES WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GET ON THE AIR THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO VOTERS DIRECTLY I THINK THIS WILL BE A BIT OF A CHORUS OF DOC YOUR CONSIDER ELECTIONS ARE FORGOTTEN
BUT THE WHOLE DRAMA OF WESTMINSTER'S REALLY FOCUSED ON JUNE AND ON THE REFERENDUM THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL BE HAPPY ENOUGH WITH THIS RESULT IT WASN'T EXACTLY A RESOUNDING PAT ON THE BACK FOR DAVID CAMERON NOT MUCH ENTHUSIASM I WOULD GUESSTIMATE STICK MY NECK I GUESS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WOMEN IN LONDON SO THAT'S ANOTHER SOME COMFORT THERE FOR STICK I'M IN LABOUR BUT WHAT THEY NEED IS TO GET THE SAME PEOPLE WHO TURNED OUT TO TURN OUT AND VOTE YES THOSE SCEPTICS IN THE PARTY I'VE GOT TO BE TURNED ROUND BY JEAN I THINK THAT UKIP
I'M ACTUALLY QUITE WELL TODAY AND THEY COULD GET A POST REFERENDUM BOOST IF BRITAIN WERE OF VOTES TO REMAIN IN BUT YOU JUST LIKE WHAT HAPPENED FOR THE S.N.P. IN SCOTLAND EVEN IF WE'RE IN FARRAJ REMAINS A POWERFUL PLAYER
I SUSPECT SO ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU SAW KATE WHICH MADE YOU THINK AHEAD TO THAT REFERENDUM
WELL CERTAINLY I AGREE WITH AND INSTEAD THEY WERE LESS THAN FRIENDLY SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM IS THAT IT IT CAUSES A BREAK WITH PARTY LOYALTIES ON THERE WILL BE AN AWFUL LOT OF LABOUR CONSERVATIVE VOTERS EVEN ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY SOME UKIP VOTERS WHO APPARENTLY DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ONCE YOU COS THAT BREAK WITH LOYAL VOTERS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THEM BACK NEXT ELECTION FINISH YOUR FINAL BRIEF THOUGH JUST A THROUGH TO CLEAR THIS ISN'T IT BEFORE THE BIG MATCH
THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE FEEL RIGHT NOW YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED INISH CARE ASTANA LOTS TO BE WRITING ABOUT THE GUARDIAN AND ELSEWHERE CAKE DEVLIN OF THE HERALD AND EMMA KEL VOLLEY OF THE ECONOMIST AS WELL DO YOU REMEMBER THOSE FINAL RESULTS ARE COMING IN ONE I THINK WITH LEFT IN SCOTLAND SOME FROM WALES AND ALSO THAT BIG LONDON MAYOR RESULTS THAT WILL COME AROUND TEATIME
THAT'S IT FROM US FOR THIS MORNING ERRANT AS WHAT JOHN NEIL AND TIM SALMON FROM NICK AND FROM ME GOOD MORNING
