OF THE TIMES WHICH SAYS THAT MISSUS COX'S SECURITY HAD NOT BEEN UPGRADED BEFORE SHE WAS SHOT BUT SHE HAD AS WE WERE HEARING IN THE NEWS AND COMPLAINED THAT SHE HAD BEEN THE TARGET OF ABUSE AND THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT THE POLICE WERE AWARE OF THAT OF COURSE THERE WAS NO KNOWN LINK BETWEEN THE MESSAGES THAT SHOULD RECEIVE THE ABUSIVE MESSAGES AND YESTERDAY'S ATTACK

JOE COX LOST HER LIFE THE EVENT IN SAINT PETER'S CHURCH WAS PACKED OUT PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS ATTENDED MANY OF THE CONGREGATION ARE WERE IN TEARS THE REVEREND PAUL KNIGHT TO LEAD THE PRAYERS SAID IN MANY WAYS WERE STILL
AND THE YORKSHIRE POST CALLS HER A LOCAL LASS KILLED HELPING OTHERS SHE WAS A SHINING LIGHT IN EXTRAORDINARY M. P. KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY WHILE DOING HER UTMOST TO HELP OTHERS IT IS TRAGICALLY POIGNANT THE JOKE OXFORD BE MURDERED WHILE SHE UNDERTOOK ROUTINE
DAILY DUTIES IN THE WEST YORKSHIRE CONSTITUENCY WHERE SHE GREW UP SHE WAS BORN TO HELP THE LESS FORTUNATE THE PAPER SAYS STRIVING TO HELP THOSE IN NEED WAS HER VOCATION IN THE OUTPOURING OF GRIEF AMONG HER CONSTITUENTS AND POLITICIANS AROUND THE WORLD SPOKE VOLUMES ABOUT HER IMPACT BEFORE HER LIFE WAS ENDED SO SENSIBLY SENSELESSLY OUTSIDE HER SURGERY

AND SHE DEFENDED PEOPLE HERE WITH THE SAME PASSION AND ENERGY AND VIGOUR AS SHE DID FOR PEOPLE IN NEED AROUND THE WORLD ALSO PERSONAL WAS THE LABOUR M.P. DONE JARVIS WHO HAD SIMILAR PRAISE FOR HER
REMEMBER JOE HE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG WOMAN SHE WAS FORMIDABLE IN EVERY ASPECT OF HER LIFE SHE DEDICATED IT TO HOPING
OTHERS HERE IN YORKSHIRE BUT AROUND THE WORLD AS WELL SHE WAS AMAZING PERSON FUNNY DETERMINED A GREAT FRIEND AND WEAK JUST GOING TO MISS HER DREADFULLY WHICH DEVASTATED BY THE NEWS
OUR CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS'S IS HERE WITH ME ROSS THE THING THAT STRUCK ME TALKING TO PEOPLE AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE CHURCH YESTERDAY AND YOU'VE BEEN HERE SINCE
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THAT EVEN IN THE SHORT TIME SHE WAS THIS AREA'S LOCAL M. P. PEOPLE KNEW OF HER THEY'D STOP HER IN THE STREET THEY SHE SOUP SHE WAS SOMEONE THEY KNEW HE FELT THAT VERY PROFOUND HEARING SAT THERE IN THE SILENCE OF THAT FRIDGE LAST NIGHT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT WE WERE THERE FOR THAT PURPOSE
IT'LL RAISE PROFOUND QUESTIONS ABOUT M.P.S SAFETY ABOUT WHY SHE WAS ATTACKED THEIR THOUGHTS WERE VERY MUCH JUST OF WHAT HAD BEEN LOST ON THAT ONE COUPLE IN TEARS WHOSE SON HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM THAT MORNING JOE COX HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING TO REDUCE WAITING TIMES FOR THEM THEY WERE SAFELY THAT SHE BECAME A FRIEND TO US WE'D ONLY KNOWN HER FOR A FEW WEEKS WHICH WAS A PERSONAL FRIEND
THE DAY I VISITED DAVID HALL THAT HE'S HOME NOW HE'S BEEN A FRIEND OF HERS SINCE THEY WERE IN SECONDARY SCHOOL TOGETHER IS NOW THE LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE GROUP AND KIRKLEES COUNCIL AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE GIRL WHO HE KNEW
I REMEMBER JO OR JOANNE AS WE CALLED IN THOSE DAYS HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR SHE WAS A VERY SPORTY GIRL SHE WAS VERY GOOD WITH AN EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
SHE WAS ELECTED HEAD GIRL IN HER FINAL YEAR AT HECKMONDWIKE GRAMMAR SCHOOL WHERE WE WERE BOTH IN THE SAME CLASS FOR HER FOR SEVEN YEARS SEVEN YEARS IN THE SAME CLASS WHAT WAS IT LIKE BEING CLASS
HE WAS ALWAYS PHONE JOE WAS GRATEFUL I REMEMBER GOING ON SCHOOL TRIPS TOGETHER GOING DOWN TO LONDON ON THE TRAIN HAVIN A GREAT TIME IN LONDON GOING TO HARRODS EATING CHOCOLATES ON THE ON THE ON THE WAY BACK ON THE ON THE TRAIN IT'S FULL OF MEMORIES AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WERE OUR CONTEMPORARIES AT THE TIME WILL HAVE MEMORIES OF JOE
IT'S JUST SUCH A SAD SAD DAY SHE BOTH REPRESENTED THIS PLACE AND SHE GREW UP HERE THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY HARD FOR
PEOPLE HERE TO TO COPE WITH IT WILL INDEED BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF HER CONTEMPORARIES THEIR PARENTS WHO'D KNOWN JOE AT THEIR GRANDPARENTS WOULD HAVE KNOWN JOE OFF LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN JOE FROM THOSE DAYS AND IT WILL BE HARD IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT THAT
JOE HAS BEEN TAKEN IN SUCH A VIOLENT FASHION AND IT'S SHOCKING TO THINK THAT IT CAN HAPPEN ON OUR STREETS LOCALLY
AND THAT FINAL SENTIMENT IS VERY STRONGLY FELT WHERE WE ARE NOW WE'LL HEAR LATER FROM ALAN WHO LIVES NOT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE ARE SAYING HE SIMPLY DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE HERE ANY MORE WITH HIS CHILDREN AFTER WHAT HAPPENED ON THE STREETS YESTERDAY RUSSELL PINS THANK YOU
THE TIME IS IT QUARTER PAST SIX THE INTERNATIONAL ATHLETICS AUTHORITIES ARE GOING TO BE MEETING TODAY TO DECIDE WHETHER RUSSIA SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PART IN THE BRAZIL OLYMPICS SEPARATELY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BODY MAKING THAT DECISION LORD COE IS IN THE SPOTLIGHT AGAIN AND NOT FOR REASONS THAT HE WELL WELCOME I'VE BEEN TALKING TO OUR SPORTS CORRESPONDENT ALEX CAPSTICK
CERTAINLY THE UPDATE FROM ORDER THIS WEEK WON'T HAVE HELPED RUSSIA'S CAUSE THAT OF COURSE SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN THERE ARE EXISTING PROBLEMS WITH THE TESTING PROGRAMME IN RUSSIA THERE WAS TALK OF FAKE URINE SAMPLES OF ATHLETES RUNNING AWAY FROM THE TESTERS HAVE SECURITY SERVICE AGENTS RUSSIAN SECURITY SERVICE AGENTS INTIMIDATING THE TESTERS TESTERS NOT BEING ABLE TO GO TO THE MILITARY CITIES WHERE MANY OF THE ATHLETES ARE BASE THAT CERTAINLY WON'T HELP RUSSIA'S COURSE BUT OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT
ACTUALLY IT'S A BIT EXCESSIVE TO AN ENTIRE NATION IT'S NOT FAIR IT'S THIS ARGUMENT OF COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY AGAINST INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE NOW I KNOW THAT CERTAIN SENIOR MEMBERS WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OR A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THIS THEY'RE NOT VERY THEY WON'T BE VERY HAPPY IF RUSSIA IS IN FACT BANNED FROM TAKING PART IN THE OLYMPICS AND THEY HAVE A MEETING NEXT WEEK
IF THAT IS THE CASE IF THE SUSPENSION IS UPHELD BY LORD COE THEN THE I.O.C. MIGHT HAVE WORSE TO SAY ABOUT THAT WHEN THEY MEET NEXT WEEK THEY MIGHT FIND A WAY TO HELP SOME ATHLETES I ATHLETES WHO CAN CONVINCE EVERYBODY THAT THERE CLEAN TO TAKE PART UNDER THE RUSSIAN FLAG AND JUST BRIEFLY ON LORD COE HIMSELF WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SPORTS ARE LESS COMMITTEE BECAUSE LORD COE IS NOW ACCUSED HE DENIES IT VERY FIRMLY BUT HE'S ACCUSED ISN'T HE BASICALLY OF MISLEADING THE COMMITTEE
YES HE IS IT'S BEEN A TOUGH BUT LORD COE AND A JOB THAT HE SAID WAS HIS DREAM POSITION WHEN HE WAS VOTED AS PRESIDENT OF THE A DOUBLE F. IN BEIJING LAST AUGUST AND VIRTUALLY SINCE THAT DATE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO CLEAN UP THE SPORE THERE'S BEEN SCANDAL AFTER SCANDAL AND THERE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS ALLEGATIONS IN THE PAST THAT LORD COE KNEW A LITTLE BIT MORE THAT WAS THAN HE WAS LETTING ON REGARDING RUSSIA THE PROBLEMS IN RUSSIA AND INDEED THE PROBLEMS WITHIN HIS ORGANISATION
ALLEGATIONS THAT PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP HIS PREDECESSOR LAMBING DEACH WERE INVOLVED IN TAKING MONEY FOR COVERING UP POSITIVE TESTS IN RUSSIA AND IN THIS PROGRAMME IT WAS AGAIN THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE THAT HE WAS GIVEN AN EMAIL BY SENDING THE EMAIL MONTHS BEFORE THE WATERS INDEPENDENT REPORT
AND COVERED THE EXTENT OF THE DOPING PROGRAMME IN RUSSIA FROM A RUSSIAN ATHLETE WHO WAS SAYING WHO'D IN THIS EMAIL IT WAS SAYING LOOK I'M A
I'M HAVING TO PAY TO COVER UP DOPING TESTS LOCO SAYS THAT HE SENT THAT EMAIL STRAIGHT ON TO THE ETHICS COMMISSION HE'S ALSO ACCUSED OF BEING INVOLVED WITH OR HAVING A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH PEPPER MUS TO DEACH HE IS THE SON OF THE ACT AND HE IS A MAN WHO IS WANTED BY INTERPOL FOR BRIBERY AMONGST OTHER THINGS SO A DIFFICULT TIME
LOCO HE DENIES EVERYTHING HE SAYS HE'S DONE NOTHING WRONG THAT HE DID HAVE ADVICE DURING THE BUILD UP DURING HIS CAMPAIGN TO BE UNPLEASANT TO THE A DOUBLE F. FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE INCLUDING PROBABLY SATURDAY THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL AND HE'S DONE NOTHING WRONG AS CAPSTICK THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT WEEK ON THE MARKET SKATEY PRESCOTT HAS THIS MORNING'S BUSINESS NEWS MORNING KATY MORNING YES JUMPY TETCHY AND THAT WERE DIFFICULT BUSINESS COMMENTATORS LOVE TO PERSONIFY THE MARKETS AND THIS WEEK IT'S FELT LIKE THEY'VE NEEDED TO PASS THE SMELLING SALTS AT TIMES MUCH OF THE VOLATILITY IS DOWN TO NEXT WEEK'S E.U. REFERENDUM BUT THERE ARE OF COURSE OTHER FACTORS AT PLAY AND TO DISCUSS THAT I'M JOINED BY KATHLEEN BROOKS HIS RESEARCH DIRECTOR OF THE CITY INDEX MORNING KATHLEEN MORNING
WE HAD BEEN EXPECTING INTERVENTION ON THE REFERENDUM HIS CHANCE LAST NIGHT AT THE MANSION HOUSE SPEECH THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY SCRAP DUE TO YESTERDAY'S TRAGIC EVENTS IF WE COULD START WITH STIRLING IT HAD A TWO MONTH LOW AGAINST THE DOLLAR AND THE EURO THIS WEEK IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY REACTIVE CHIMP IN OPINION POLLS ON THE REFERENDUM
DO YOU THINK IF WE VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE STATUS QUO IS KEPT DO YOU THINK WE'D SEE A BOUNCE I THINK WE WOULD SEE A SHORT HAND OUTS IN THERE MAYBE THE WEEK AFTERWARDS AND I THINK IT COULD BE QUITE SIGNIFICANT SOMETHING TO THE REALM OF LIKE MAYBE TEN FIFTEEN PERCENT HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS THAT WEIGHING ON STERLING AS WELL ESSENTIALLY WE'VE BEEN IN A DOWN TREND FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS AND IT'S LARGELY DUE TO A VERY LARGE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND
SIGNS AT THE ECONOMY ISN'T DOING THAT WELL SO I THINK I'D STILL BE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE POUND EVEN IF WE DO VOTE TO REMAIN SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MARKET IT'S EASY TO LAY A LOT OF THE BLAME FOR THIS VOLATILITY AT THE DOOR OF THE REFERENDUM NEXT WEEK BUT ESSENTIALLY THE GOAT THE GLOBAL LANDSCAPE IS IS QUITE DIFFICULT AT THE MOMENT ABSOLUTELY IF YOU LOOK AT THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED FOR EXAMPLE YOU ARGUABLY IT'S MUCH MORE THE KIND OF THE CLAPS IN THE OIL PRICE YOU PROBLEMS WITH CHINA THAT HAS WEIGHED ON THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED AND IT'S JUST KIND OF SHORT TERM VOLATILITY WITH
POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AND IS REALLY PUSHED BLOW SIX THOUSAND BUT WE WERE HEADING THAT WAY REALLY ANYWAY THE FUNDAMENTALS WERE TELLING US THAT AN OVERNIGHT WE'VE HAD THE JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER SAYING HE'S DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISE IN THE YEN WHAT'S HAPPENING
SO THE YEN HAS REALLY SEARCH I MEAN IT'S REACHED A THREE YEAR HIGH VERSUS STERLING OR TO YOUR HIGH VIS IS THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE JAPANESE AUTHORITIES DON'T WANT THEY WANT WEAKER CURRENCY TO BOOST THEIR ECONOMY YET IN THE CURRENT IT NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENT IN F.X. VERY NERVOUS ENVIRONMENT SAFE HAVENS LIKE THE JAPANESE YEN ARE IN GREAT DEMAND SO THEY'RE SAYING BASICALLY THAT THEY WILL THEY COULD POTENTIALLY INTERVENE TO PHYSICALLY WEAKENED CAN PROBABLY ON THERE
IN THE OUTCOME IN THE COMING DAYS AFTER THE OUTCOME OF THAT OF THE REFERENDUM IF WE VOTE
DO YOU THINK WHATEVER NEXT WEEK'S OUTCOME MARKETS ARE JUST LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF CERTAINTY THAT THEY JUST WANT AN ANSWER EITHER WAY MARKETS ALWAYS LOOK FOR CERTAINTY INVESTORS LOOK CONCERNED CERTAINTY ONCE WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ONCE THEY'RE IN THE LANDSCAPE IS CLEAR ALL THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN IS GOING TO BE A LOT CLEARER THEN I THINK WE'LL SEE THINGS SETTLE REGARDLESS OF HOW WE VOTE IN THERE IN A WEEK'S TIME
IT'S INTERESTING WE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MICROSOFT BUYING LINKED IN THIS MORNING BUT THEY'VE SURPRISED US AGAIN THEY'VE GONE THE LATEST COMPANY TO GET INVOLVED IN THE LEGAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THEY'VE BROUGHT A SOFTWARE WHICH TRACKS THE SALE OF CANNABIS IT SEEMS THAT TECH COMPANIES ARE JUST EXISTING OUTSIDE THIS MARKET VOLATILITY I MEAN ABSOLUTELY MIKE'S OFF THIS WEEK DID SPEND TWENTY SIX
A BILLION DOLLARS ON ON LINKED AS HE SAID HAVE MADE ANOTHER ACQUISITION IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE WE SEEING THE BIG OLD VERY LARGE TECH COMPANIES FROM THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES COME IN AND REALLY SNAP UP THESE THESE WITH THERE'S NAPPIES THESE NEW THIS NEW WAVE OF OF OF TECH COMPANY WHICH WHICH IS A SIGN OF THE TIMES REALLY THEY'RE THE ONES WITH THE MONEY TO DO IT AND THEY CAN REALLY SUPPORT THE YOUNGER GENERATION TECH COMPANIES COMING THREE KATHLEEN BROOKS RESEARCH DIRECTOR FOR CITY INDEX THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
WELL IN A RUNNING THEME ON THE MARKETS THERE WAS A DROP IN EUROPEAN BANKING SHARES YESTERDAY DEUTSCHE BANK'S SHARES SHARE PRICE FELL TO ITS LOWEST EVER IN EARLY TRADING AND A DECADE ON FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IT SEEMS THE BANKS STILL HAVEN'T QUITE RECOVERED FACING LOW INTEREST RATES AND HEAVIER REGULATION ARE ALSO FENDING OFF NEW CHALLENGES
ACCORDING TO CITY GROUP UP TO ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF JOBS COULD BE LOST IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES OVER THE NEXT DECADE THIS DEVELOPMENT IN THE INDUSTRY'S CALLED FINN TACK IT'S THE SWEET SPOT IN THE VENN DIAGRAM BETWEEN FINANCE AND TECHNOLOGY THINK CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS PEER TO PEER LENDING AUTOMATED FINANCIAL ADVICE WILL JOINING ME NOW TWO STALWARTS OF THE INDUSTRY TOM BLOCK
TOM FROM FAT FIELD IS FOUNDER OF MONDAY BANK THAT'S ONE THAT YOU'LL ONLY FIND ON YOUR SMARTPHONE NOT ON THE HIGH STREET OR LAURENCE WINTER IS FROM INNOVATE FINANCE THAT'S THE GLOBAL MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATION FIN TECH COMPANIES GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING MORNING
TOM DO YOU SEE YOURSELF AS BRING THE BANKING INDUSTRY I THINK EVERY STARTER FOUND THEMSELVES AS YOU BRING SOMETHING CERTAINLY WERE TAKING A DIFFERENT APPROACH I THINK I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THIS
YOU COMING ATTACKING BANKING BY EFFECTIVELY USING THEIR SMARTPHONE TO OFFER THE SAME BANKING SERVICES AT A LOWER COST WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY VALID STRETCHY I THINK WE'RE DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHICH IS USING THEIR SMARTPHONE AND TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP THAT CUSTOMER SORT OF ON A ON A DAY TO DAY AND AN HOUR TO HOUR BASIS REALLY AND TO USE THAT RELATIONSHIP TO THEN
HELP CUSTOMERS MANAGE THEIR THE LIFESTYLE IT IS MORE OF A LIFESTYLE PRODUCT THEN A CHEAPER WAY TO SELL MORTGAGES SO IT'S INTERESTING YOU USE THE WORD PRODUCT I THINK ONE THING CUSTOMERS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WITH COMPANIES LIKE YOURS IS REGULATION
IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR THE FORMER CITY REGULATOR LAW TURNER EXPRESS THIS ON THIS PROGRAMME WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT PEER TO PEER
I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT THE LOSSES ON PEER TO PEER LENDING WHICH WILL EMERGE WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS WILL MAKE THE WORST BANKERS LOOK LIKE ABSOLUTE LENDING GENIUSES BECAUSE I THINK A GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE GOING INTO A LENDING PROCESS ON A TACTICAL PLATFORM WITHOUT ANYBODY REALLY DOING
GO OUT AND KICK THE TYRES CREDIT ANALYSIS DO YOU RECOGNISE THOSE CONCERNS SO I PERSONALLY HAVE MONEY IN IN VARIOUS PITS TO BE BUT I'VE GOT SOME MONEY SO PRONE IN FUNDING CIRCLE AND I THINK IF YOU
IF YOU SEE THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT PLATFORM NOT US NOT OWED SOME SECURED SAVINGS BACK FROM THEN IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND IT'S PART OF A BALANCED PORTFOLIO I HAVE MONEY IN AN ICE WHICH IS MAKING ALMOST NO MONEY AT ALL AND I'M I'M SEEING MORE LIKE SIX OR SEVEN OR EIGHT PER CENT RETURNS NEEDS PEER TO PEER LEN DOESN'T AND CLEARLY THERE'S GOT TO BE RISK THAT GOES ALONGSIDE THAT
ARE COPIES OF A MORE GENERAL QUESTION DOES THE AVERAGE RETAIL INVESTOR REALLY UNDERSTAND IT'S AN AT RISK INVESTMENT NOT A DEPOSIT GUARANTEED SAVINGS ACCOUNT LINES A QUESTION TO YOU THEN LOOKING AT FIN TECH AS A WHOLE DO YOU THINK THAT
THESE SMALL COMPANIES COMPANIES LIKE TOM TOMS CAN HAVE THE SCALE
AND THE EXPERIENCE AROUND TO REALLY SAFEGUARD CONSUMERS' MONEY
WELL I THINK THEY DO AND SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IS HAPPENING IN THE FIN TECH MARKET AND THAT IS THAT INSTITUTIONS HAVE STARTED TO PAY ATTENTION TO COMPANIES LIKE TOM WE'RE REALLY YOU FIND THAT INNOVATION HAPPENS IN SMALLER FIN TECH COMPANIES AND WHAT OF THAT INNOVATION HERE IN LONDON IS HAPPENING WITH EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL SERVICES PEOPLE
NO YOU'RE NOT NOT NOT JUST OF THE WEST COAST WHIPPERSNAPPERS OR SOMEONE'S TALKING ABOUT OR IN THE U. R. I X. OF THE USER INTERFACE AREA AND SO INSTITUTIONS HAVE RECOGNISED THAT DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION AS GOING ON OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN ORGANISATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY LOOKING TO PARTNER WITH HIM TEXT
SO WHY DO YOU THINK BANKS ARE LOSING OUT TO FRONTEX THAT I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY THAT BANKS ARE LOSING OUT TO FIN TEXTS BUT TO GET A GUN AND MOM DOES EXAMPLE A LOT OF SYNTAX ARE VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON USING THE POWER OF DIGITAL AND THE SMART PHONE AS A MEANS OF ENGAGING CUSTOMERS IN A WAY THAT INSTITUTIONS HAVE HAVE NEVER REALLY DONE TO BE IN THERE TO BE FRANK WITH YOU AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE REAL ATTRACTION IS AS THAT UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR ISN'T DELIVERING
A BETTER AND MORE DIVORCE PRODUCT AND SERVICE IT IS REALLY WHAT THE INTEREST IS TO THE INSTITUTIONS SO IT'S HIS REGULATION KEEPING UP DO YOU THINK
I THINK THE REGULATORS HAVE A TOUGH JOB CERTAINLY AM WE'VE BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO BANKING LICENCE FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO
AND THAT THAT REGULATION PROCESS ESPECIALLY FOR NEW BANKS HAS TO PARIS BECOME EASIER BUT I THINK IT STARTED OUT BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE INS NOW JUST VERY VERY DIFFICULT SO I THINK THERE IS WE'LL DEFINITELY AT THE GOVERNMENTAL LEVEL SO
DOWNING STREET THE TREASURY HAD VERY KEEN FOR NEW CHALLENGES NEW AND SORT OF BEEN TECH ENTRANCE AND I THINK THE SENIOR LEVELS OF THE F.C.A. IN AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND ALSO A VERY KEEN BUT I THINK THAT IT'S TAKEN A WHILE FUR FOR TO CATCH UP
TOM BLOMFIELD AND LAWRENCE WENT TO MY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL HAVE YOU EVER STARTED A RESTAURANT AND WONDERED IF THE FLOUR IN FRONT OF YOU IS A REAL OR FAKE WELL IF YOU HAVE TO TOUCH IT TO SEE THE CHANCES ARE IT CAME FROM FROM MY FRIDAY BOSS THIS WEEK MARK NESBITT'S COMPANY TREE LOCATE HAS BEEN GOING FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND EMPLOYS FORTY PEOPLE MAKING BESPOKE ARTIFICIAL TREES AND PLANTS FOR THEIR HOSPITALITY BUSINESS EARLIER THIS WEEK I VISITED HIM AT THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS IN BELFORD NORTHUMBERLAND AND FIRST THE OPERATIONS DIRECTOR GEORGE ROBERTSON SHOWED ME ROUND

WE PICKED THE BYFORD REMEMBER REASONS IT'S THE GATEWAY TO THE WHOLE MEENA REGION OF MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA IT'S AN AREA WHICH IS GROWING HUGELY IN TERMS OF BUILDINGS AND ENTERTAINMENT IT'S IT'S AN IDEAL MARK OF OUR TYPE PRODUCTS
I THINK THAT THE FACT THE WATER IS TREMENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE OVER THEIR PRODUCTS FIT THE BILL PERFECTLY ON THAT FRONT BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN JUST WIPE THEM DOWN HOOVER THEM AND OFF YOU GO EXACTLY FOR OUR EXTERIOR STUFF WE DO OVER THERE WHICH IS A HOSEPIPE WASH IT DOWN OCCASIONALLY IT'S COVERED IN DUST IT SUITS THE ARTIFICIAL MARKET PERFECTLY

THE MOMENT LISTEN RESEARCHERS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF A BRITISH TAXPAYER FUNDED SCIENCE VESSEL IN AN ARCTIC TOURIST VOYAGE THIS SUMMER THE A S. ERNEST SHACKLETON HAS BEEN HIRED TO GUIDE A LUXURY LINER THROUGH THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE CRITICS SAY IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF TOURISM IN SUCH A FRAGILE AREA
THE TIME IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MURDER OF THE M.P. JOE COX'S PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON EM PEAS SECURITY AND IT HAS EMERGED THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH POLICE AFTER RECEIVING THREATS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CAROLE WALKER JOINS US NOW WHAT DO WE KNOW OF OF WHAT SHE TOLD THE POLICE
GOOD MORNING MICHELLE WE KNOW THAT SHE DID SPEAK TO THE POLICE IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR AND THIS WAS ABOUT A MALICIOUS COMMUNICATION A MAN WAS ARRESTED HE WAS THEN CAUTIONED THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE THAT THIS IS IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH HER BRUTAL DEATH LAST NIGHT CERTAINLY STEPHEN KINNOCK WHO SHARED AN OFFICE WITH JOE COX THIRD THAT THEY HAD DISCUSSED IT IN THE TERMS OF IT BEING THE KIND OF NASTINESS THAT M. PEAS DO YOU SOMETIMES
TO PUT UP WITH WE KNOW THAT THE METROPOLITAN POLICE HAD PROVIDED SOME SORT OF SECURITY ADVICE BUT IT SEEMS JO COX WAS
NOT UNDULY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS CLEARLY IT DOES HIGHLIGHT ONCE AGAIN THIS QUESTION OF THE SECURITY OF EM PEAS THE IRONY IS THAT HERE AT WESTMINSTER WHEN THEY'RE IN PARLIAMENT THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF SECURITY SCREENING AROUND THE BUILDING ARMED POLICE AROUND AND SO ON BUT OF COURSE
SO MUCH OF THE WORK OF EM PEAS IS OUT AND ABOUT IN THEIR CONSTITUENCIES TALKING TO THE VOTERS TALKING TO THOSE WHO MAY NOT HAVE VOTED TO PUT BEFORE THEM
HOLDING PUBLIC MEETINGS ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS OF THOSE THAT THEY ARE IN PARLIAMENT TO REPRESENT I THINK M.P.S ACROSS ALL PARTIES HAVE BEEN EXPRESSING THE CONCERNED THAT THESE TRAGIC EVENTS THE TRAGIC LOSS OF SUCH A BRIGHT YOUNG M.P.
MUST NOT AND CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO HARM SOMETHING WHICH IS SO FUNDAMENTAL TO THEIR DEMOCRACY AND THE WAY THEY DO THEIR WORK IN TERMS OF CURRENT POLITICAL ACTIVITY REFERENDUM CAMPAIGNING ON HOLD OH CAROL HOW LONG WILL THAT LAST YOU THINK
THAT'S RIGHT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED SPONTANEOUSLY LAST NIGHT AS A MARK OF RESPECT FOR JOE COX THERE WILL BE NO CAMPAIGNING TODAY SOME OF THE EVENTS OVER THE WEEKEND ALSO APPEAR
TO BE BEING CANCELLED OR UND DOUBT IT IS OF COURSE UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPAIGNS AT SOME STAGE IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
WILL RESUME AS WE HEAD INTO THE FINAL FEW DAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST WEEK IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER HAVING TAKEN A PAUSE FOR THOUGHT AND REFLECTED ON THE DEATH OF ONE OF THEIR COLLEAGUES WHETHER THIS
WILL AFFECT THE TONE OF WHAT HAD BECOME A PRETTY
A NET ICH CAMPAIGN BUT CERTAINLY FOR THE TIME BEING PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS ARE WITH JOE COX HER FAMILY
THE LOSS OF THE MOTHER OF TWO YOUNG CHILDREN OF COURSE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A TIME WHEN LABOUR WOULD HAVE BEEN CELEBRATING A BY ELECTION VICTORY THEY MORE THAN DOUBLED
THE MAJORITY IN THE TOOTING BY ELECTION LAST NIGHT ELECTING DOCTOR IS THAT ALAN CARR ON BUT OF COURSE AT THE MOMENT THE REFLECTIONS OF JUST SIMPLY WITH JOE COX HER FAMILY AND THE MANY MANY TRIBUTES THAT THERE HAD BEEN NOT JUST FROM WESTMINSTER
CAROL WALKER THANK YOU THE TIME IS TWENTY TO SEVEN YESTERDAY THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TRAINS WHERE EITHER CANCELLED HER ARRIVED MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES LATE ON SERVICES RUN BY GO VIA TENNIS LINK IT'S THE WORST PERFORMING RAIL FRANCHISE IN THE COUNTRY
WE'VE BEEN HEARING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS ON THIS PROGRAMME HOW AN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE OVER GUARDS IS MAKING THINGS EVEN WORSE FOR PASSENGERS PARTICULAR ON THE SOUTHERN RAIL SERVICE THAT RUNS FROM BRIGHTON TO LONDON GOING TO HEAR FROM THE COMPANY THEMSELVES LATER IN THE PROGRAMME FIRST LET'S TALK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT RICHARD WESTCOTT AND IT'S IT'S COMPLICATED ISN'T IT RICH IT'S NOT AN ORDINARY FRANCHISE
IT'S NOT NO EFFECTIVELY THE COMPANY DOESN'T TAKE THE MONEY FROM TO TRAIN TICKETS AT TAKES A DIRECT PAYMENT IF YOU LIKE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OR TO RUN THEIR SERVICES AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY COMPLEX FRANCHISE IT'S HUGE IT'S THE BIGGEST OUT THERE IT'S EFFECTIVELY THREE FRANCHISES PUT INTO ONE AS PART OF THAT FRANCHISE IS THIS SIX BILLION POUND TENS LINK PROJECT THEY REAL REBUILDING LONDON BRIDGE STATION
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX CALLS HUGE DISRUPTION TOTALLY SEPARATE TO THIS STRIKE AND SO IT WAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS IS WHEN THERE ARE CANCELLATIONS BECAUSE OF STRIKE ACTION
IT'S NOT THE COMPANY BUT BUT SUFFERS FINANCIALLY IT'S THE GOVERNMENT THE IT AND IS SHOULD IT IN THAT CASE BE THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS TRYING TO SORT OUT THE NIGHTMARISH CONDITIONS AT THE BEAMS CERTAINLY IN RECENT DAYS BETWEEN BRIGHTON AND LONDON MADE IT WHEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE UPSET AND ANNOYED AND ANGRY DID IT SHOULD THEIR ANGER BE DIRECTED AT THE COMPANY OR THE GOVERNMENT
WELL YOU COULD ARGUE I KNOW PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO GET THAT LINE THAT PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WAY THE COMPANY HAS RUN THE FRANCHISE SINCE THEY TOOK OVER REGARDLESS OF THE STRIKE PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE WAY THE UNIONS ARE REACTING AND PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING THAT THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T STEPPING IN TO SORT IT OUT CLAIRE PERRY THE REAL MINISTER HAS COME ON THE OFFENSIVE BASICALLY ATTACKED THE RAIL UNIONS BUT
BUT RIGHT NOW THE GOVERNMENT OF KEEPING THE WHOLE THING CERTAINLY PUBLICLY ANYWAY AT ARM'S LENGTH BECAUSE IT'S A PRIVATE COMPANY IT'S A PRIVATE CONTRACT PART OF THE POINT OF PRIVATISATION AS A WEEK WE GET THESE COMPANIES INTO KIND OF WE SPECIFY WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO BUT IT'S THEIR BUSINESS SO RIGHT NOW YOU ARE NOT GETTING GOVERNMENT STEPPING IN COS THAT'S THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT OF PRIVATISATION RICHARD THANKS AND WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF CURVIER THAMES LINK UP TENT
THE TIME IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS ARE THERE IS EXTENSIVE COVERAGE OF YESTERDAY'S TERRIBLE EVENTS HERE IN WEST YORKSHIRE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH OR THE GUARDIAN BOTH USED THE WORDS OF JOE COX'S HUSBAND BRENDAN IN THEIR HEADLINES JOE BELIEVED IN A BETTER WORLD AND SHE FOUGHT FOR IT EVERY DAY THE DAILY BILL PAYS TRIBUTE TO A DEVOTED MOTHER OF TWO A DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT A REMARKABLE WOMAN WHAT A TRAGIC WASTE IT SAYS
THE DAILY MIRROR COLUMNIST ROS WITH WYN JONES KNEW HER HOW INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT A WOMAN SO FULL OF LIFE AS JOE COX COULD BE DEAD SHE WRITES HOW IMPOSSIBLE THAT A FORMER AID WORKER WHO HAD SURVIVED MULTIPLE WAR ZONES SHOULD DIE SO BRUTALLY OUTSIDE A YORKSHIRE LIBRARY
ACCORDING TO THE TIMES BOTH SIDES IN THE REFERENDUM DEBATE HAVE BEEN SENT REELING BY THE TRAGEDY THE PAPER BELIEVES IT WILL MARK A TURNING POINT AND THIS IS COX WAS A MOTHER AS WELL AS A DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT MEANS THAT ATTACKS ON THE POLITICAL CLASS OR WESTMINSTER ELITES ARE LIKELY TO BE OFF LIMITS IT REPORTS THAT THE POLICE WERE POISED TO PUT EXTRA SECURITY IN PLACE FOR MISSUS COX THE PAPER SAID SHE'D BEEN HARASSED IN A STREAM OF MESSAGES OVER THREE MONTHS THE ATTACKERS
SHOPS THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT SAYS THE FINANCIAL TIMES POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN STUNNED BY THE VIOLENCE THE FRONT PAGE OF THE EYE NEWSPAPER SIMPLY HAS A PICTURE OF JOE COX IN THE WORDS MUM PROUD YORKSHIRE LASS M. P. SHOT DEAD WHILE SERVING THE PEOPLE
THERE'S WIDESPREAD SYMPATHY FOR SIR CLIFF RICHARD AFTER YESTERDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE THAT IT HAD INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE HIM OVER ALLEGATIONS OF HISTORIC ABUSE CLIFF RICHARD WAS ROBBED OF TWO YEARS OF HIS LIFE SAYS THE SUN AND PUT THROUGH HELL BY SEX ABUSE FANTASIST AIDED AND ABETTED BY THE SCANDALOUS INEPTITUDE OF THE POLICE THE DAILY MAIL ATTACK SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AND THE B. B. C. OVER THE LIVE COVERAGE OF THE INITIAL POLICE RAID ON SIR CLIFF'S HOME CALLING IT ONE OF THE MOST UNEDIFYING EPISODES OF BRITISH JUSTICE
THE DAILY EXPRESS CALLED SOUTH YORKSHIRE BRITAIN'S MOST INEPT POLICE FORCE AND PREDICTS IT'LL BE DISBANDED THE HANDLING OF THIS CASE BY POLICE AND PROSECUTORS IT SAYS HE'S AN UTTER DISGRACE
THE TIME IS QUARTER TO SEVEN AND THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING IS THAT THE BISHOP OF HUDDERSFIELD THE RIGHT REVEREND JONATHAN GIBBS HAS LET A SPECIAL VIGIL FOR THE LABOUR M.P. JOE COX DESCRIBING HER AS A WOMAN UTTERLY COMMITTED TO SERVING OTHERS IN HER COMMUNITY AND THE WHITE AWAY
A VERDICT IS EXPECTED TODAY IN THE TRIAL OF A FORMER NAZI GUARD AT AUSCHWITZ RHINE HOLD HANNING WHO'S NINETY FOUR IS CHARGED WITH BEING AN ACCESSORY TO THE MURDERS OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AT THE DEATH CAMP OUR BERLIN CORRESPONDENT JENNY HILL
RIGHT HOLD HANNING BLINKS STARTLED BY THE PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS AS HE COMES INTO COURT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THIS FRAIL OLD MAN AS A YOUNG S.S. GUARD
FORCING TERRIFIED PRISONERS OUT OF CATTLE WAGONS AND INTO AUSCHWITZ OR MARCHING THEM UNDER A SKY OBSCURED BY SMOKE TO THE GASTRIC
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT PROSECUTORS BELIEVE HE DID WRITE WILL TURNING THEY SAY MAY NOT HAVE KILLED ANYONE BUT HE WAS PART OF THE NAZI MACHINE AND AS SUCH FACILITATED GENOCIDE
TO SIT IN THE HUSHED COURTROOM HERE REALLY IS TO WATCH GERMANY CONFRONT HIS PAST FACE TO FACE I WASN'T WONDERING
IF HE EVER REALLY
SO ARTHUR WAS AS HUMAN BEINGS MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS AFTER IT WAS LIBERATED THE SURVIVORS OF AUSCHWITZ HAVE HAD THEIR DAY IN COURT HEADY BUM STOOD JUST FEET AWAY FROM MISTER HANNING AND DESCRIBED THE HORRORS SHE ENDURED
I THINK THAT I COULD GIVE YOU I DON'T FEEL I HAVE TO WRITE DIFFERENT DO YOU
HAVING MY MOTHER KILLED I THINK
AND SOMETHING THAT WAS SO CHILDREN AND BABIES
AND I SAY GO FOR IT GIVE ME THE NAME I DO
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER RIGHT HOLD HANGING NONE OF THE SURVIVORS DO BUT WHILE THIS TRIAL IS ABOUT DETERMINING ONE MAN'S GUILT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THIS COUNTRY EXAMINING ITS DARKEST HOUR IN PUBLIC PERHAPS FOR THE LAST TIME
BECAUSE PROSECUTORS ARE RACING AGAINST TIME I MEET YANGTZE ROMMEL YOU COULD CALL HIM GERMANY'S OFFICIAL NAZI HUNTER IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVE THE ROOM IS GLOOMY STACKED FLOOR TO CEILING WITH BOX FILES UNIFORM GREY AND STAMPED WITH REFERENCE NUMBERS
THIS IS A FINAL FROM THE YOU KNOW SIXTY ONE HAVE CONCERNING THE F.I.S. DIVISION DOES RIGHT
AT THE LECH CRIMES TAKING GERMANY'S NAZIS ARE WELL HIDDEN BUT THEIR NAMES ARE
ON WORK RECORDS IN DIARIES ON WITNESS LISTS FROM WAR CRIMES TRIALS THIS TASK IS A VERY DIFFICULT NOWADAYS THAT SEVENTY YEARS AFTER THE WAR THERE
POTENTIAL OF THE SUSPECTS NINETY YEARS OLD OR EVEN OLDER BUT WE HAVE TO TRY IT WHAT'S POSSIBLE TO DAY TO ESTABLISH WHAT HAS HAPPENED
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE SOCIETY INTO AMMONIA AND ABROAD TO UNDERSTAND
NOWADAYS WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS HOW IT WAS ORGANISED AND HAUL VOICE RESPONSIBLE NOT ONLY THE HIRER RINGS BUT ALSO THE LOWER RINGS WHERE NECESSARY IN ORDER THAT THE MACHINERY
THERE ARE SOME REALLY TERRIBLE DETAILS IN THESE FILES
AS WE HAD YELLING PAPAL FILES BUT ABOUT IS
WHAT IS THAT IN THE STATEMENTS OF THE WRITTEN A ATROCITIES YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
THE WORK DONE HERE HAS CULMINATED IN SIX PEOPLE BEING CHARGED AS ACCESSORIES TO MASS MURDER ONE MAN'S BEEN CONVICTED
BUT ONE HAS SINCE DIED AND THREE OTHERS ARE TOO ILL TO STAND TRIAL RIGHT HOLD HUNTING MAY WELL BE THE LAST OF GERMANY'S WARTIME NAZIS TO FACE JUSTICE
JIMMY HILL REPORTING THE TIME ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WAS THE WORLD'S SIXTH MOST POPULAR TOURIST DESTINATION VISITOR NUMBERS TO TURKEY
HAVE SLUMPED BY AROUND FORTY PER CENT OBVIOUSLY SECURITY THREATS ARE PART OF IT AROUND WITH MOSCOW WAS ALSO PART OF IT THERE WAS A RUSSIAN WAR PLANE SHOT DOWN BY TURKEY LAST YEAR AS YOU REMEMBER BRITISH BOOKINGS TO TACK IT DOWN BY A THIRD AND TURKEY OF COURSE STANDING NOW TO LOSE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT IT DESPERATELY NEEDS IN TOURIST REVENUE A TURKEY CORRESPONDENT MARK LEARN REPORTS FROM ANTALYA
THE LATE JUNE SUN HAS WARMED TO THE MEDITERRANEAN HERE IN ANTALYA THE SAND IS SOFT THE MOUNTAINS SILHOUETTED IN THE DISTANCE THE ONLY THING THIS PLACE IS LACKING ITS PEOPLE TO ENJOY
THERE'S BARELY A SOUL ON THIS BEACH ROWS OF SUN LOUNGERS ARE EMPTY THE RUSSIANS ARE SAYING AWAY AFTER A POLITICAL ROW WHEN TURKEY SHOT DOWN A RUSSIAN JET LAST YEAR
BRITS GERMANS AND OTHERS HAVE GONE ELSEWHERE AMIT'S SECURITY CONCERNS HERE TURKEY'S TOURISM JEWEL IS FAR FROM SHY
IT'S A PRETTY ENORMOUS CHANDELIER THAT SWEATER FORGET IT IT IS ACTUALLY TWO POINT FIVE TONNES TOLD A GYM AT ALL WHO RUNS THE HOTEL BEHIND THE BEACH AND IS ON THE BOARD OF THE ANTALYA HOTEL ASSOCIATION
HIS FIVE STAR DELFIN IMPERIAL SCREAMS LAVISH A GIANT CRYSTAL CHANDELIER HANGS IN THE LOBBY AND THE NEO BAROQUE FURNITURE IS DRIPPING WITH FOAM GOLD WITH THE RUSSIAN MARKET DOWN BY NINETY FIVE PERCENT THE HOTEL IS ONLY A THIRD FULL
FROM THE DAY THAT I WAS BROUGHT INTO IS NEVER NEVER SEEN A CRISIS
IT IS THE ROCK BOTTOM OF THE TOURISM OF TURKS I DON'T WANT TO EVEN THINK ABOUT IF IT GETS ANY WORSE IF IT DOES GET WORSE WHAT COULD HAPPEN THE WHOLE TOURISM SECTOR IN AUSTRIAN TURKEY WILL END AND THEN IT'S MINUS THREE BILLION
TURKEY'S HOLIDAY REPUTATION IS BEING DESTROYED BY A SERIES OF BOMBS BY KURDISH MILITANTS AND THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP OVER THE PAST YEAR SOME TARGETING TOURISTS AND WHEN TURKEY SHOT DOWN A RUSSIAN JET FOR VIOLATING ITS AIRSPACE THE KREMLIN ORDERED THE FOUR AND A HALF MILLION RUSSIAN VISITORS COMING HERE TO STAY AWAY
IT'S NOT ONLY THE EIGHT PER CENT OF THE POPULATION WHO WORK DIRECTLY IN TOURISM WERE AFFECTED BY THE SITUATION BUT ALSO BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON TOURIST CUSTER
IN THE OLD TOWN OF ANTALYA SHOPKEEPERS ARE SITTING OUTSIDE JUST WAITING FOR PASSING TRADE THAT ISN'T COMING BUSINESSES
MAYBE ELLY CHIEF OF THIS ONCE THE REASON WHY HE'S DOING THIS
IS THE GOAL AND ESPECIALLY WRONG GRRR RELATIONSHIPS WITH DILL EVA'S RIPPED DID POLITICS THEN EUGENE IMAGE OFF TO
I JUST BUMPED INTO A COUPLE OF BRITISH TOURISTS FROM WHERE THAT POOL BLACKPOOL AND DID YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT COMING HERE I PLAY GOLF WITH A FRIEND YOU'VE GONE TO ORLANDO AND HE SAID
I WILL TO TURKEY SAID OR POLE TOURISM INTO IF YOU CAN'T HAVE THE TURKEY SO HE'S GONE TO ORLANDO WHAT'S HAPPENIN ALL FORTY NINE PEOPLE DEAD FIFTY EIGHT PEOPLE INJURED VERY SORRY IT'S EVERYWHERE
A SHORT DRIVE AWAY IN THE RESORT OF CAME OUT THEY WERE ALSO STRUGGLING
A LIVELY GAME OF WATER POLO IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S BRIGHTENING UP THE GARDEN RESORT HOTEL AT THE MOMENT AND THE PLAYERS ARE PRETTY MUCH GOT THE POOL TO THEMSELVES THIS HOTEL WHICH USUALLY HAS SEVENTY PERCENT OCCUPANCY IN JUNE IS NOW AT FIFTEEN PER CENT THEY'VE HAD TO LAY OFF FORTY MEMBERS OF STAFF AND PRICES HAVE DROPPED BY A THIRD
I WAS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS BUT WE RESEARCHED IT ON THE INTERNET I'VE GOT A VERY CHEAP DEAL IT WAS THREE HUNDRED POUNDS EACH
FOR A WEEK THAT WAS ALL INCLUSIVE THAT'S EXCELLENT
ANTALYA IS BIGGEST EVENING SHOW IS BY GYMNASTS AND FIRE DANCERS BUT IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN ENTERTAINMENTS TO FIRE UP TURKISH TOURISM THIS COUNTRY IS FALLING FAST AND WITH ATTACKS CONTINUING AND INCREASINGLY UNPREDICTABLE PRESIDENT THERE'S LITTLE SIGN OF STABILITY ON THE HORIZON
MARK LOWE AND REPORTING IT SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WHEREIN WERE STILL IN WEST YORKSHIRE THIS MORNING AFTER THE DEATH OF JOE COX THE LOCAL M.P. THE FIRST SERVING MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO BE KILLED FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE FIRST BRITISH WOMAN M.P. EVER TO SUFFER THAT FATE
ONE OF HER PREDECESSORS IN THIS WEST YORKSHIRE SITA'S ELIZABETH PEACOCK WHO WAS THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. FOR BATLEY AND SPEND BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN SHE'S WITH ME NOW GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW DID YOU FIRST COME ACROSS JOKE
I WAS RUNNING A VILLAGER IN THE ELECTION AND SO WAS SHE BUT WE NEVER OUR PATHS EVER CROSSED IN THE AREA HERE AND I WAS WORKING AT MY DESK AT HOME ONE DAY AND I PUT THE PARLIAMENTARY PROGRAMME ON THE TELEVISION
AND I SEEN THIS YOUNG MATED BROKE REDRESS VERY SMART ON THE LABOUR BENCHES AND THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD I WASN'T WATCHING I HEARD THE SPEAKERS
IN SPAIN AND I LOOKED UP AND SHE STOOD UP AND SHE MADE SUCH A BRILLIANT MAIDEN SPEECH IS QUITE
IN THERE TO MAKE A MAIDEN SPEECH WHICH IS THE ONE TIME IN YOUR PARLIAMENTARY LIFE NOBODY WILL INTERRUPT YOU
IT WAS WELL CRAFTED IT WAS WELL PRESENTED AND ASTONISHES SHE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE RISING STAR SAT DOWN AND WROTE
AND CONGRATULATED HER MUM HER MAIDEN SPEECH IN THEN SHE WROTE BACK AND SO WE WERE IN COURT WOULD YOU SAY YOU WERE PROUD OF MY OBVIOUSLY ACROSS THE POLIS OH YES YES I THINK PEOPLE GET THE IDEA YOU HATE EACH OTHER AND IT'S NOT LIKE THAT IN PARLIAMENT YOU WORKED TOGETHER ON COMMITTEES AND THINGS NO I I JUST
I DON'T THINK TWICE ABOUT THEIR SHOULD DO IT I JUST DID IT AND WE ARE TALKING JUST VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGES
LIBRARY WHERE SHE WAS HOLDING A CONSTITUENCY SURGERY YESTERDAY AND THAT IS SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU HELD IN THE DISTANCE EVENTS YOURSELF I DID DID YOU EVER FEEL VULNERABLE
NO I CAN'T SAY I DID PARTICULARLY BUT THEY WERE AND HAVE THEM AS REMIND ENEMY A C. FOUR OR FIVE INSTANCES WHERE WHEATIES NEED TO HAVE POLICE AROUND AT THEIR REQUEST
I ONLY AGREED AS LONG AS THEY WERE HIDDEN AND I DIDN'T WANT THEM UP FRONT TO PUT PEOPLE OFF COMING TO SEE ME
I THINK ONE PARTICULAR ONE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS CHAPPIE WHO WENT AROUND WITH A KNIFE IN HIS BOOTH
THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY
MY SECRETARY AND I HOPE I ALWAYS HAD SOMEBODY WITH ME WE JUST CARRIED ON AS NORMAL AND THERE WAS NO PROBLEM AT ALL
AND I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH THERE WAS MY WORK IF I COULDN'T BE AN JUST JOE YESTERDAY COULDN'T I WALKED AMONGST THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO BE DOING YOU KNOW ASKING HERE TOO
TAKE UP CERTAIN CAUSES YOU'VE GOT TO BE OUT AND ABOUT PUBLIC IT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS HAVE AN AUDREY I WAS BUT DO YOU THINK
HOWEVER MUCH THAT IS THE IDEAL DO YOU THINK SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO CHANGE
NOT BECAUSE THAT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR DEMOCRACY
I THINK IT'S UNIQUE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT I USED TO WALK ROUND HERE USED TO COME TO MARKET DAY I WAS ACTUALLY OVER INTO KEY YESTERDAY WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT I FELT SO SICK I HAD TO PULL UP MY CAR AND
I COULDN'T DRIVE AND I THOUGHT THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING IT'S IT'S IT'S FANTASY
I THINK IF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT HAD TO TAKE SO MANY PRECAUTIONS THEY WILL TAKE THEMSELVES AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RECKLESS
GRAY BROUGHT IN A DEMOCRACY

THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE STATUE IN THE TOWN CENTRE HERE IN PERSONAL IN WEST YORKSHIRE IS OF JOSEPH PRIESTLEY EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THEOLOGIAN AND SIGNED
CREDITED WITH DISCOVERING OXYGEN AND INVENTING SODA WATER
THE BASE OF IT IS COVERED THIS MORNING IN FLOWERS
FLOWERS IN MEMORY OF A WOMAN A BIT DIFFERENT
JOE COX ELECTED TO SERVE THIS CONSTITUENCY OF BATLEY AND SPEND WAS MURDERED YARDS AWAY FROM WHERE I AM NOW
SHE'D BEEN HOLDING A CONSTITUENCY SURGERY IN THE LOCAL LIBRARY JUST BEHIND A POLICE CORDON SHE WAS PROUD TO SAY SHE WAS BORN AND BRED IN HER
WHERE SHE DIED LAST NIGHT THERE WAS A VIGIL IN ONE OF THE CHURCHES
ON A STILL SUMMER'S EVENING IN WEST YORKSHIRE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE GATHERED TO REMEMBER THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD TO BECOME THEIR M. P. ONLY LAST YEAR
AMONG THE CONGREGATION CONSTITUENTS WHO HAD COME TO HER WITH THEIR PROBLEMS LIKE ANNE MARIE AND MARTIN KILGALLEN WHOSE SON FREDDIE IS AUTISTIC
FREDDIE HAD HIS DIAGNOSIS THIS MORNING
WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN BACK AND FORTH TO GO OUT IN THE LONG WAITING TIMES AROUND AUTISM JOE DEALT WITH THAT PERSONALLY AND WHAT A LOT OF INPUT INTO AND BECAME A FRIEND SHE WAS THERE LIKE SO WHEN THEY WENT OUT TO TEND THEIR BACKS DO YOU CAME TO GROUP SHE SUPPORTED US
WHICH IS BLESSED TO KNOW WE'RE BLESSED TO HAVE WORKED WITH A WONDERFUL INSPIRING WOMAN TOO
AND THERE WERE THOSE WHO WORKED WITH HER AT WESTMINSTER FELLOW LABOUR M.P.S MARY CRAIG AND DHANJI
JOE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS A FORMIDABLE WOMAN SOMEONE WHO WAS FUNNY TOO
DETERMINED UTTERLY COMMITTED TO HER CONSTITUENTS BUT SOMEONE WHO LOVED HER KIDS YEAH TWO WONDERFUL LITTLE KIDS WHO'VE LOST THEIR MUM
IT'S DEVASTATING FOR ALL OF US BUT WE WILL REMEMBER HER WITH GREAT LOVE AND GREAT AFFECTION AS SOMEONE WHO'D DEDICATED ALL OF HER LIFE
TO SERVING THE PUBLIC AND TO HELPING OTHERS AND THAT IS A FORMIDABLE EXAMPLE THAT SHE HAS THE ALL OF US
SHE LEARNED FAST SHE CRACKLED WITH ENERGY SHE FIZZED WITH LIFE AND THAT IS WHY IT IS SO VERY VERY SHOCKING BUT AS WE HEARD JUST NOW IN CHURCH WE
WANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE JOY AND ENERGY THAT JOKE BROUGHT SIRE LIFE AND NOT REMEMBER
THE TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER DEATH
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD JOE ODD KAHN HAD COME TO THE CHURCH WITH HIS MOTHER AND REMEMBERED THE FIRST TIME HE MET JOE COX CHOOSE WALKING ONE MY STREET TALKING TO PEOPLE NOT FOR THEM
AND IN OUR STOPPED ANOTHER CHAT WITH THEN BUT THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS TO HAVE STOP IT HAVING A CHAT WITH JOAN SHE ENCOURAGED ME
AND THAT IS THAT IS HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN THE LABOUR PARTY THAT IS HOW I ENDED UP SOME OF THE COUNCIL BECAUSE OF JO'S ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE VERY FIRST TIME I MET HER CHOOCHY
YEAH DEFINITELY I CAN SEE ON YOUR FACE AND WE CAN HEAR IN YOUR VOICE
AND SHE'LL BE MISSED NOT JUST BY ME BUT FROM WITHIN THE COMMUNITY
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TO WHAT ENCOURAGED TO BE INTO POLITICS BY JOE COX WHO WAS
JOINED HERE IN BURSTALL TOWN CENTRE BY DOCTOR JONATHAN GIVES THE BISHOP OF HUDDERSFIELD WHO WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO SPOKE IN THE DITCH HER LAST NIGHT
DO YOU FIND THE WORDS AFTER SOMETHING AS
THE EVENTS
IT'S INCREDIBLY HARD IT'S HARD FOR ME MICHELLE AS IT IS FOR EVERYBODY AND ALL OF US THIS MORNING DEEPLY SHOCKED BY WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY
ONE OF THE THINGS THE CHURCH CAN DO AT A TIME LIKE THIS IS TO PROVIDE BOTH A SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER AND TONIGHT LAST NIGHT PEOPLE NEEDED TO COME TOGETHER
AND ALSO WITHIN THAT CONTEXT BOTH ACKNOWLEDGING THE PAIN EVERYBODY
BUT RECOGNISING THAT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THAT PAIN FOR US OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH
UNDERNEATH THAT IS THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND GOD HIMSELF WEEPING WITH US I'M HOLDING OUT HIS ARMS TO IT I THINK WE TRIED TO BRING THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU KNEW JOE
I HAVEN'T KNOWN HER VERY WELL I'M PRETTY NEW TO MY JOB AND I ARRIVED ABOUT THE SAME TIGHT SHE DID US THE M. PEOPLE WE'VE MET ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS
PUBLICLY AND I'VE SEEN THE WAY IN WHICH HE'S ENGAGED WITH
THE WAY IN WHICH SHE WAS VERY EASY WITH PEOPLE SHE WAS A WOMAN OF THIS COMMUNITY THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF PASSION FOR CAUSES AND COMPASSION FOR PETE
AND ALSO I'VE BEGUN TO TRY AND DEVELOP A MORE A PRIVATE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER AND THE OTHER LOCAL IN PEACE BECAUSE THEY DO A FANTASTIC JOB
THEY GET A LOT OF STICK AND JUST BEING THERE FOR THEM TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE'S PRAYING FOR THEM AND ROOTING FOR THEM THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO DO YOU SEE HER
FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW HOW SHE ENGAGED WITH
WITH PEOPLE WANT WHAT DID YOU OBSERVE I SAW HER IN THE CONTEXT IN PARTICULAR THE MOST RECENTLY OF A SERVICE TO ESTABLISH A NEW TEAM
WHICH WAY
A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OTHER
THAT MANY OF OUR MODERN MUSLIM BROTHERS AND SISTERS CAME TO GO
SO ON THAT DAY WHAT I SAW WAS JOE ENGAGING WITH THE WHOLE COMMUNE
AND JUST JUST KNEELING ON THE FLOOR PLAYING WITH HER CHILDREN ONE MOMENT AND THEN TALKING WITH THE LOCAL IMAM AND OTHERS SO I THOUGHT I SAW SOMEONE WHO WAS UTTERLY ENGAGE WITH
AS WE KNOW TWO SHE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT THE CAUSE OF REFUGEE
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S A PASSION WHICH IS SHARED BY ALL THOSE IN THE DIFFERENT FAITH COMMUNITIES IN THIS AREA
YOU TALK ABOUT THAT HERE BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHE'S KNOWN THAT SHE WAS KNOWN FOR THAT SHIT
REMEMBERED FOR IT
IT WASN'T SOMETHING SHE TALKED ABOUT ON ON THAT DAY BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S SOMETHING SHE MADE HER CONSIDER
NOT LEAST COMING OUT OF HER FANTASTIC WORK WITH OXFORD
IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE I WOULD WANT TO SAY VERY MUCH THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE FAITH COMMUNITIES ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT FAITH COMMUNITIES SHARED COMMON CAUSE WITH HER AND RECOGNISED AND WENT DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR HER PASSION FOR THAT
DOCTOR JONATHAN GIVES A BISHOP OF HUDDERSFIELD THANK YOU THANK YOU
BUT I'M A QUARTER PAST SEVEN WHEN SEBASTIAN COE TOOK OVER AS THE PRESIDENT OF WORLD ATHLETICS SOME PEOPLE WONDERED IF HE WAS THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN A VICE PRESIDENT FOR YEARS DURING WHICH TIME ATHLETICS FACE MOUNTING CONCERNS ABOUT DRUG TAKING IN THE SPORT PARTICULARLY IN RUSSIA
WILKO WAS ASKED ABOUT IT BY M.P.S ON THE CULTURE SPORTS A MEDIA SELECT COMMITTEE AND HE SUGGESTED THAT HE HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF THE RUSSIAN SCANDAL NOW INVESTIGATION BY THE ABUSES PANORAMA IN THE DAILY MAIL HAS SUGGESTED THAT LORD COE HAD BEEN SENT AN EMAIL CONTAINING AN ATTACHMENT FOR DEN ATTACHMENT WHICH DETAILED ALLEGATIONS ABOUT A RUSSIAN ATHLETE WHO WAS NOT ONLY DOPING BUT ALSO BEING BLACKMAILED BY ATHLETICS OFFICIALS JESSE NORMAN CHAIRS THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND I SPOKE TO HIM JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO
WELL THERE'S SOME POTENTIALLY VERY SERIOUS ISSUES INVOLVED PURE AND WE MAY WELL I THOUGHT SO IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN THAT WE WANT TO HELP LORD COE BACK IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE I DON'T GET TWO FOR IT WHERE THE CREWS COULD BE BUT THEY KNOW THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS MATTERS I THINK THAT WHEN LORD KERR APPEARED IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE IN DECEMBER
HIS ANSWERS WERE VERY GENERAL ONCE IN MANY WAYS SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE TO MY COLLEAGUE IAN LUCAS AND THE IDEA THAT HE COULD HAVE RECEIVED THIS EMAIL AND AS I UNDERSTAND WHEN HIS ACCOUNT NOT HAVE OPENED IT HAVING BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE IDEA I WILL HEAR FROM THE SENIOR POSITION AT THAT POINT BUT FOR SIX YEARS
AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL CASES SORT OF
DISHONESTY AND CORRUPTION IS VERY VERY DISTURBING YOU SAID VERY DISTURBING I MEAN IF HE DID IT THAT'S THE END OF IT ISN'T IT HE IF HE CAN CONVINCE YOUR COMMITTEE YES I RECEIVED THIS EMAIL WHICH HE SAYS HE DID BUT NO I DIDN'T READ IT WHICH SHE SAYS HE DIDN'T THEN OR WHAT THEN
WELL IN A FUNNY WAY I DON'T THINK YOU SHE WAS REALLY SO MUCH WHERE HE OPENED IT OR DIDN'T OPEN IT'S A HE HAD EMAIL AND HE'S OH COULD BE UNDER A DUTY TO DO WITH THE CONTENTS OF ITS THEIR FAULT SHOULD'VE OPENED PASSED IT ON TO THE PEOPLE WHO DID HAVE A DUTY TO DO WELL HE PASSED IT ON TO
THE ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE FUNCTION BUT WHAT HE DID NOT DO WAS TO ENGAGE OR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT EVEN ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT AND I'M NOT GOING TO HELP IT GET AHEAD OF WHERE THE COMMITTEE IS GOING TO COME OUT ON THIS AND MY JUDGEMENT FOR FOR MY COLLEAGUES AS A WHOLE BUT AS I SAY THERE'S SOME VERY SERIOUS AND DISTURBING SHOULD SHOW DO YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIM IN HIS CURRENT ROLE
I THINK THAT
THE JURY IS OUT AS MUCH AS PRESENTLY STAND COMPETENCE IS ONE THING CONFIDENCE IS ANOTHER THING AND PART OF THAT WOULD ALSO BE TO ASSESS
YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S ACTUALLY GIVING THE EYE DOUBLE A. F. THE LEADERSHIP THAT HE HAS PROMISED
NO THEY'LL BE SWEPT AWAY A SECURITY COMES TO THE VIEW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME SHREWD MISLEADING PARLIAMENT
WELL WHAT WORD TO SWEPT AWAY IN WHAT SENSE WELL IN THE SENSE THAT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE NORMALLY WE WOULD CONSIDER WHETHER WHAT HE WAS DOING A GOOD JOB AS ALL IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF A PROCESS OF SCRUTINY BUT IF IT TURNS OUT HE'S BEEN MISLEADING PARLIAMENT WE RHETORIC THAT USE THAT ACTION THAT SOME MIGHT RATHER MORE SERIOUS ISSUE
AND WOULD TAKE WHAT ACTION AGAINST HIM WELL WE WERE PROMISED HIMSELF REACTIONS THAT OPPONENT YOU CHRISSIE I HAVE A LIMITED IN THIS RECORD BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY ABOUT HER FOR THE SPEAKER DON'T NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS SHOWING THAT HE HAD MISLED PARLIAMENT IF YOU WANT TO
FOR JOSIE MAKE PROPER REDRESS
AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY ISN'T IT THAT HE WOULD STAY IN HIS JOB I'M NOT GOING TO GET ALL OF THAT LET'S SEE WHERE WE SEE WHERE WE END UP BUT I MEAN THAT CERTAIN SITUATIONS SORENSTAM HOW SOON IF YOU ARE GOING TO RECORD THEM AND I DO TAKE YOUR POINT THAT IS NOT A COMPLETELY FIRM DECISION BUT YOU'RE PRETTY PUT PLAIN THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT THAT HAPPENS WITHIN A FEW WEEKS
WELL WE'LL HAVE TO SEE I WOULD WOULDN'T ONE WOULD HOPE SO IF WE HAVE VERY FEW SYSTEM DAYS LEFT IN PARLIAMENT AND THOSE ARE ALREADY HEAVILY SCHEDULES AND THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE OF WANTING TO ALLOW ANY FURTHER INFORMATION THAT MAY COME OUT TO DO SO BEFORE WE SEE HIM IT'S NOT
IT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT AN IMMEDIATE SUMS TO PARLIAMENT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY OF PROSECUTING THIS WE ALSO AS I SO WANT TO LOOK AT WHEN WE DO GET HIM IN WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO LOOK AT HIS RECORD IN OFFICE
AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED TODAY MY NORMA CAN I FINISH BY ASKING IN THIS IT DESPERATELY SAD MORNING OF COURSE WE'RE ALL THINKING ABOUT JOE COX THE WHOLE NATION IS YOU ARE A SENIOR MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT DID WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS IT SHOULD WE AS A NATION BE THINKING AGAIN ABOUT THAT THE NATURE OF OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE
I MEAN SO YOU WILL KNOW THAT I HAVE HAD GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT
WHEN WHICH REPUBLIC TO BASES
CAPTURED IN YOU KNOW WITHIN PARLIAMENT
UM AND ER AMONGST SENIOR POLITICAL AND PUBLIC FIGURES
I DON'T THINK THIS APPALLING INCIDENCE HAS AS FAR AS I'M AWARE ANY DIRECT RELATION TO THAT BUT IT HAS GIVEN I THINK EVERYONE IN THEIR OWN PARLIAMENT PAUSE AND IN MAYBE IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO RETHINK THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS
PARLIAMENT IN TOWARDS THE ROOM MEMBERS OF POGROMS AMONG ALL THE ONES THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS AND THAT INCLUDED OF COURSE COX WAS TO HAVE BEEN A PRETTY DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF ALL THE SCANDAL OF MONSTER GETS PUT UP ABOUT THE WIND IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A SLIGHTLY FAIRER AND MORE HONEST APPRAISAL ON ALL SIDES I THINK JESSE NORMAN THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE NORTH LONDON BOROUGH OF ENFIELD HAS BECOME THE FIRST PUBLIC BODY TO RECRUIT A VIRTUAL EMPLOYEE TO DEAL WITH ITS FRONT LINE SERVICES KITTY PRESCOTT HAS MORE DETAILS
YES IN A BID TO SAVE MONEY FROM THE AUTUMN AND FEEL COUNCIL RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THEIR QUERIES FROM PARKING TO RUBBISH DEALT WITH BY A ROBOT AMELIA CREATED BY TECHNOLOGY COMPANY I.P. SOFT HER MAKE A CHAT UNDO BASE I SHALL REDUCE THE TIME THAT IT TAKES FOR INQUIRY STREET TO BE DEALT WITH AND THAT HER RESPONSES WILL ONLY GET BETTER WITH EXPERIENCE I WENT TO MEET THEM BOTH
NOW LET'S START ASKING QUESTIONS WHERE IS OUR PLEASE LOCALLY HAD QUIET
YEAH MONDAY O.K. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT AN AVATAR ON A SCREEN WITH A SORT OF CHATTERBOX UNDERNEATH IT AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE ALL OF THE WORDS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN FROM WIKIPEDIA ABOUT BARCLAYS HAVE SEPARATED
AS YOU PUT IN EACH DIFFERENT QUESTION ABOUT BARCLAYS SHE'S SIFTING THROUGH THOSE WORDS IN THAT LANGUAGE AND PULLING OUT THAT INFORMATION TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE TO SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
WITH AMELIA CLEARLY BUT I THINK WHAT IRRITATES A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY RING CALL CENTRES IS FEELING THAT THEY'RE NOT TALKING TO A REAL PERSON AND FRANKLY SHE STILL DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A REAL PERSON I'LL TELL YOU HOW REAL SHEARS SO I'M GOING TO ADD SALT HER BUT SAY I SAY I DON'T LIKE YOUR VOICE
SORRY DID YOU THAT AND YOU CAN SEE YOUR EXPRESSION YOU CAN SEE HER EMOTIONAL CAUTIONS HOW DO WE KNOW SHE CAN DO AS GOOD A JOB AS A HUMAN BEING PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A COUNCIL TALKING ABOUT VULNERABLE PEOPLE THE ELDERLY POSSIBLY PEOPLE WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH WANTING TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH A REAL PERSON ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DEAL
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SEPARATES AMELIA AND TRUE COGNITIVE SYSTEMS SHE IS ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN AND TIME TO SATISFACTORY RESOLUTION
SOMETHING LIKE AN EIGHTEEN MINUTE TO DO FOR A MINUTE SO IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR THE MEMBERS WORK COMING TO THE COUNCIL REQUESTING SERVICES HAVE THEY'RE GETTING
QUICKER TURN AROUND I'VE SEEN A SURVEY RECENTLY THAT SHOWS COGNITIVE COMPUTING SUFFER SUCH AS IMMEDIATE CAUSES HUGE JOB LOSSES ONE SERVICE OR PREDICTS THAT THE LOSS OF JOBS COULD BE NINE POINT ONE MILLION
BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN AMERICA WHILE I ASKED THOSE THOSE PEOPLE THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HORSE AND CARRIAGE
HISTORY AS IT HAS ANSWERED DO ALL THE LUDDITES AND NEW LUDDITES THAT IN FACT TECHNOLOGY ONLY CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES DO YOU THINK WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEAL
THAT YOU'VE PASSED THE TURING TEST THAT YOU'VE CREATED SOMETHING THAT BUT CAN THINK LIKE A HUMAN I THINK WE ARE VERY CLOSE
TO ACHIEVING THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCE BUT RIGHT NOW IF YOU SUDDENLY STARTS TALKING ABOUT A MOVIE AND YOU START TALKING ABOUT ENGLAND AND WALES AND YOU SAY WHAT HAPPENS ABOUT THAT
THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING HIS FATHER HE NEEDS TO GET TO A LEVEL THAT I CAN CONTACT SWITCH AND BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND RESPOND IN KIND
THAT WAS JET UNDO BAY OF I.P. SOFT SOME QUICK NEWS FROM TESCO AFTER MUCH SPECULATION IN THE SUPERMARKET HAS THIS MORNING CONFOUND THE SALE OF ITS LOSS MAKING JOBBIES GARDEN CENTRES BUSINESS FOR TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILLION POUNDS CASH TO A GROUP OF INVESTORS HE BOUGHT THE COMPANY FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX MILLION POUNDS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SALMON AND THIS IS ALL PART OF C.O. DAVE LEWIS A STRATEGY TO SELL OFF NON CORE BITS OF ITS BUSINESS LAST WEEK TESCO ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS SELLING IT'S GIRAFFE RESTAURANT CHAIN
KATIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS TWENTY FIVE PAST SEVEN AND SONALI SHAH HAS THE SPORT
GOOD MORNING MICHELLE ECSTATIC ENGLAND PLAYERS DOMINATE THE BACK PAGES THIS MORNING AFTER THEIR TWO ONE VICTORY OVER WALES AT THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH A ROARING DANIEL STURRIDGE WHO SCHOOL THE INJURY TIME WINNER VERY PROMINENT THAT'S BIG JOHN MURRAY WHO'S NOW IN PARIS AFTER COMMENTATING ON THE MATCH LAST NIGHT MORNING JOHN GOOD MORNING IT TURNS OUT HALF TIME WAS PROBABLY THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF THIS MUCH ANTICIPATED MATCH
YES I THINK THE THE CRITICS OF THE ENGLAND MANAGER ROY HODGSON WERE SHARPENING THEIR KNIVES AT HALF TIME WHEN ENGLAND WERE ONE NIL DOWN GARETH BALE IT SCORED A LONG RANGE FREE KICK BUT HE MADE A DOUBLE CHANGE WHICH IS QUITE A DECISIVE MOVE TO BRING ON STORAGE AND VARTY FOR KANE AND STIRLING
AND ROY HODGSON ALSO BROUGHT ON RUSH FOR YOUNG MARCUS RUSH FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD DURING THE COURSE OF THE SECOND HALF AND THEY FORCED WALES BACK AND IT EVENTUALLY PRODUCED THE WIN BUT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT SONALI I THINK I THINK THAT CHANGE TO MAKE TWO CHANGES AT HALF TIME
WHEN YOU STILL GOT FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF THE MATCH TO PLAY IT WAS A GAMBLE BUT IT CAME OFF A HUDSON YESTERDAY AND WALES WILL BE HEARTBROKEN AT LOSING THIS BATTLE IN PARTICULAR WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THEIR PERFORMANCE YET WAS A STAMP PERFORMANCE FROM WALES ANOTHER ANOTHER ANOTHER STRONG PERFORMANCE BUT I THINK IN THE END
THERE THE FIVE STRIKERS THAT ENGLAND HAD IT EVENTUALLY PAID OFF FOR ENGLAND BUT I THINK WE ARE STILL IN A GOOD POSITION TO REACH THE LAST SIXTEEN BECAUSE OF THE WIND THAT THEY HAD AGAINST SLOVAKIA IN THEIR FIRST MATCH AND DRAW AGAINST RUSSIA ON MONDAY WOULD BE LIKELY TO SEE THEM THROUGH TO THE LAST SIXTEEN AND ACTUALLY WALES COULD YET TOP THE GROUP IF THEY WIN THAT MATCH AND THERE THE OTHER RESULT GOES THEIR WAY YES BECAUSE ENGLAND PLACE OF A CURE ON MONDAY AT THE SAME TIME DON'T THEY
YEAH SO TEDDY AND ON MONDAY IF ENGLAND WIN THEY WILL WIN THE GROUP BUT I THINK RECOVERY IS GOING TO BE A BIG ISSUE FOR ENGLAND AND HOW MUCH THE TWO GAMES THAT THEY'VE PLAYED SOCKS SO FAR HAVE TAKEN OUT OF THE ENGLAND PLAYERS BECAUSE BOTH MATCHES AGAINST RUSSIA IN MARSEILLES YESTERDAY AGAINST WALES HAVE GONE RIGHT TO THE END SO I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY THE ENGLAND
STAFF WILL BE WORKING ON VERY HARD AND ACTUALLY THIS MORNING ALL THREE HOME NATIONS REMAIN IN CONTENTION FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN BECAUSE NORTHERN IRELAND MEN HISTORY IN FRANCE WITH THEIR FIRST EVER VICTORY AT THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS YES THEY DID IT WAS A FAMOUS WIN FOR THEM NORTHERN ISLAND IN IT AND IT GIVES THEM A VERY DECENT CHANCE OF AT LEAST AT LEAST BEING ONE OF THE FOUR BEST THIRD PLACE TEAMS IN THE GROUP'S HE'LL QUALIFY FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN BUT
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THERE AND DON'T GO TOO EARLY ON IT BECAUSE WELL ONLY HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF HOW THAT STANDS IN TERMS OF THE THIRD PLACE TEAMS AFTER ALL OF THE TEAMS HAVE PLAY TWO MATCHES AT THE END OF TOMORROW
THANKS VERY MUCH JOHN MURRAY SEWING AND PLAY SLOVAKIA AND WALES PLAY RUSSIA THAT'S ON MONDAY THEIR FINAL GROUP GAMES BOTH MATCHES AT EIGHT P.M.

NO APPOINTMENTS NECESSARY PLEASE JUST COME ALONG AND PRIVATE THE SOME M.P.S HAVE BEEN VERY
ANXIOUS FOR YEARS CERTAINLY AFTER STEPHEN TIMMS LABOUR M.P. WAS ATTACKED ABOUT THEIR OWN SAFETY BUT THIS IS SO CENTRAL TO THE WAY THEY DO THEIR JOBS THE WAY THEY ACTUALLY HELP
THEIR CONSTITUENTS THAT WHATEVER EXTRA SECURITY IS ADDED AT THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER

ONLY BECAUSE OF A SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL SHORT TERM FUNDING ACCORDING TO THE NEWSPAPER SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT EXERCISING EXACTLY FOUR HOURS AFTER YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING CAN INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF REMEMBERING WHAT YOU'VE LEARNT RESEARCHERS AT THE DONGAS INSTITUTE IN THE NETHERLANDS PHYSICAL EXERCISE IMPROVED MEMORY AND MEMORY TRACES BUT ONLY IF THE EXERCISE WAS DONE IN A SPECIFIC TIME WINDOW AND NOT IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEARNING THE SCIENTIST IT DEMONSTRATES THAT DOING SPORTS CAN HELP YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO EIGHT MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND PEOPLE COULD BE AFFECTED BY A DECISION BY THE HEALTH WATCHDOG NICE NOT TO MAKE A NEW TREATMENT FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS AVAILABLE ON THE N.H.S. THE FINAL DRAFT GUIDANCE RELATES TO A DRUG CALLED OR CAN BE WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED A BREAKTHROUGH
THE WATCHDOG TOOK THE VIEW HOWEVER THAT ITS COST WAS NOT JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF THE DATA THEY HAD ABOUT ITS BENEFITS WILL FOURTEEN YEAR OLD CLARA MAN TOOK PART IN A CLINICAL TRIAL OF ALL CANDY AND SHE JOINS US NOW FROM BRISTOL ALONGSIDE HER FATHER NICHOLAS MAN GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MY NEEDN'T WORRY CLARA HOWL WHAT DID CYSTIC FIBROSIS AFFECT YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU WENT ON THIS DRUG TRIAL
I WAS HOSPITALISED A LOT BUT INTRAVENOUS TREATMENT TO SPECIALLY I WAS ON I'VE TO FIFTY PILLS A DAY WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT UM I WAS VERY WEAK I COULDN'T RUN LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THEY ALWAYS COME LAST IN SCHOOL RACERS
I WAS JUST I COUGHED ALL THE TIME THEY'D BE NIGHTS LIKE DIDN'T REALLY SLEEP BECAUSE I'D BE AWAKE COUGHING AND MY PARENTS ARE VERY WORRIED OBVIOUSLY BEFORE I WAS DIAGNOSED I THINK IT WAS TRAUMATIC FOR THEM
HOW MUCH DID THINGS CHANGE AFTER YOU WENT ON THERE ON THE TRIAL THIS BEING AMAZING IT'S A MIRACLE I'M RUNNING SO MUCH MORE I HAVEN'T BEEN HOSPITALISED IN TWO YEARS MY LUNG FUNCTION WHICH IS HOW THEY MEASURE HOW WELL YOUR LUNGS ARE WORKING AT THE HOSPITAL HAS GONE RIGHT UP
IT'S BEEN AMAZING I'VE HAD SO FEW INFECTIONS ARE NOT COMPLETELY FREE BUT MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE AND MAYBE I CAN JUST BUTT IN TO SAY THAT WE HAD A VERY SICKLY CHILD AND NOW WE'VE GOT A VERY HEALTHY ONE AND ONE WHO'S GROWING PROPERLY AND PUTTING ON WEIGHT AND DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT ORDINARY CHILDREN DO BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH CHANCE OF THAT A FEW YEARS AGO
AND SO THIS IS ALL DOWN AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED TO THE EFFECTS OF BEING ON THE TRIAL FOR ALL CANDY YES AS FAR AS WE CAN OBVIOUSLY YES
AND HOW DO YOU THEREFORE FEEL ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE HEALTH WATCHDOG NICE'S HAS TAKEN THE VIEW AT LEAST IN ITS FINAL DRAFT GUIDANCE THAT THAT AS FAR AS IT'S CONCERNED THE DATA
DOESN'T THAT LISA DATE ON LONG TERM BENEFITS DOESN'T SUPPORTED ITS USE BY THE N.H.S. WILL THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF FEELINGS WE HAVE ONE IS THAT
WE KNOW THE SCIENTIFIC RESULTS OF THE TRIAL WHICH WERE QUITE NARROW HE SCIENTIFIC IN THE SENSE THAT THEY FOCUSED ON LUNG FUNCTION
DON'T ACTUALLY REFLECT THE WHOLE PERSON AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE WHOLE PERSON IS BETTER AND STRONGER AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS SO THAT THERE'S THAT WE FEEL IT'S TRAGIC FOR CHILDREN WITH THIS ILLNESS I'M NOT
ABLE TO ACCESS SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER ON THE OTHER HAND WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH WE CAN UNDERSTAND BUT I THINK WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE WE'RE GETTING TOO MUCH
THEY WERE SAVING IN THE FUTURE FOR TRANSPLANTS HOSPITALISATION AND GENERAL ANTIBIOTICS ALL THIS WILL BE REDUCED BECAUSE OF ALL CAN BE AND SO ALTHOUGH THE FIGURES SCARY I THINK THAT THINK THAT OR PICTURES AND THE FIGURE NICHOLAS VAN IS ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS PER PATIENT
WHAT WHAT A NICE ARE SAYING IS THAT IS THAT THE LONG TERM BENEFITS ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVEN END IN THIS IN THE SHORT TERM THEY FEEL THE BENEFITS ARE MODEST I THINK I MEAN I I KNOW THAT THE FIGURE WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THE TRIAL WAS THAT THEY WERE OF THE ORDER I THINK
A FOUR PER CENT IMPROVEMENT THAT WAS FOUR PERCENT IMPROVEMENT IN LUNG FUNCTION OVER THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE TRIAL WHAT I THINK WE FEEL IS THAT
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME MEASUREMENT OF THE WHOLE BENEFIT US NOT JUST LUNG FUNCTION IN A BETTER I'M JUST SO MUCH BETTER
ALFIO EVERYWHERE TARRY FUNCTIONS AS A PROPER MEMBER OF SOCIETY THAT OF BEING A BURDEN ON IT IN A SENSE THE UM THE NARROW CALCULATION WE WE DON'T KNOW BUT THE LONG TERM OF COURSE BUT WITH TARA'S BEEN ON THE TIP TRY HER NOW FOR THREE YEARS PLUS AND IT'S MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO HER LIFE
I'M CLARA YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TAKING ALL CANDY'S UNDERSIDE OF THE DRUG COMPANY IS HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO SUPPLY USE IT AS A SORT OF THANK YOU THING ON A TRIAL I'LL GET IT FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME WE DON'T KNOW FOR HOW LONG IF THE FINAL DECISION BY NIGHT IS THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND THAT THEN THEY WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY AND I CAN'T REALLY IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT IT NO NO THEY HAVE SAID VERY GENEROUSLY THAT FOR THE MOMENT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY IT
AND WE WERE VERY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE WEAR EXTRAORDINARY O.K. BUT WE HOPES THAT MAYBE NEGOTIATIONS WILL TAKE PLACE BETWEEN NOW AND WHENEVER THE AXE COMES DOWN WHICH WILL
MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR NICE TO COME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION YES MEAN OBVIOUSLY AFTER DECISIONS LIKE THIS THE FOCUS INEVITABLY IS ON THE WATCHDOG I CAN COME OUT WITH WITH WITH THIS DECISION OF THIS GUIDANCE BUT
THERE'S ALSO THE POINT ABOUT THE DRUG COMPANY AND YOU'RE CALLING THEM GENEROUS OR NICHOLAS MAN BUT YOU YOU COULD SAY THEY COULD BRING THE PRICE DOWN I COULD THERE IS ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION BUT WHAT THEY'VE DONE FOR YEARS OF WORK THEY PUT IN WILL BE WASTED IN THE U.K. IF IT WASN'T WONDERED JUST BE TERRIBLE NIGHT I TAKE YOUR POINT ENTIRELY THEIR GENEROUS WITH US BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE EATEN THEY DO AS CLOSE AS THEY HAVE HAD HE A HUGE INVESTMENT THEY NEED TO FIND SOME RETURN ON IT SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THIS KIND OF MEDICATION
THANK YOU BOTH FOR TALKING TO US AND CLARA THE VERY BEST OF LUCK FOR ALL OF YOU HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU
FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER HERE IN OUR STUDIO THIS MORNING HE'S A BISHOP RICHARD HARRIS GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S BEEN SHOCKED BY THE VIOLENT DEATH OF JOE COX AND IT'S VERY PROPER THAT THIS SHOULD BE MARKED BY A SUSPENSION OF REFERENDUM CAMPAIGNING AND CANCELLING ANY PLAN CELEBRATIONS AFTER THE TOOTING BY ELECTION IT'S A TRAGEDY FOR OUR POLITICAL LIFE AND A TERRIBLE SADNESS FOR JO'S HUSBAND AND TWO YOUNG CHILDREN AND WE ALL THINK OF ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME OF GRIEF
IT'S A SHOCK WHICH DOES I THINK BRING TWO THINGS TO THE FORE FIRST THE VIOLENCE WHICH SIMMERS UNDER SO MUCH OF LIFE WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT COMPARED TO SO MANY OTHERS HE'S ORDERED AND CIVILISED FOR THE MOST PART WE GO ABOUT OUR BUSINESS FEELING SAFE THIS IS THE FIRST SITTING M.P. TO BE MURDERED SINCE IAN GOWER WAS ASSASSINATED IN NINETEEN NINETY
NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE BITTER RESENTMENTS AND PERSONAL FEUDS DAILY PRESSURES WHICH BUILD UP FRUSTRATION AS WELL AS SPORTING AND POLITICAL PASSIONS WHICH AROUSES SADLY TWO OF THE ARE DISTURBED MINDS AND DISORDERED EMOTIONS WHICH CAN ERUPT IN A TERRIFYING WAY AS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE RECENT VIOLENCE OF SOME FOOTBALL FANS
THE SECOND ASPECT OF THIS TRAGEDY AS THE WAY IT HIGHLIGHTS THE PUBLIC VULNERABILITY OF THOSE WHO STAND FOR ELECTION IN RECENT YEARS POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN CASTIGATED VERY OFTEN UNFAIRLY BUT THE FACT IS THAT MOST OF THEM ARE HARD WORKING DEDICATED PEOPLE IT'S INTERESTING HOW OFTEN WHEN A POLITICIAN DIES IT SAID AT THEM THEY WERE A VERY HARDWORKING CONSTITUENCY M.P.
JO IN PARTICULAR HAD A LIFE OF SERVICE FIRSTLY WHAT SAM AND THEN AS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT SHE WAS NOT ONLY RESPECTED BUT MUCH LOVED BY ALL WHO KNEW HER AS THE TRIBUTES BRING OUT SO STRONGLY
BUT THE VERY FACT THAT SOMEONE STANDS FOR ELECTION AND THEN STANDS UP FOR VARIOUS CAUSES SOME OF THEM UNPOPULAR CAN BRING AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF ABUSE ESPECIALLY NOW OF COURSE WITH A PLETHORA OF SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S NOT PLEASANT CAN BE VERY HURTFUL AND NOW IN THE CASE OF JOE COX HAS TAKEN EXTREME FORM WE NEED THE LAW WE NEED THE POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICES TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM ORDER FOR A CIVILISED LIFE TO FUNCTION AT ALL
BUT DEEPER THAN THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THE LATENT VIOLENCE THAT IS UNDER THE SURFACE IN SO MANY SITUATIONS IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT JESUS SAID YOU'VE HEARD THAT OUR FOREFATHERS WERE TOLD DON'T COMMIT MURDER ANYONE WHO COMMITS MURDER MYSTERY BROUGHT TO JUSTICE BUT WHAT I TELL YOU IS THIS
ANYONE WHO NURSES ANGER AGAINST HIS BROTHER MUST BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE WHOEVER CAUSES BROTHER GOOD FOR NOTHING DESERVES THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT STRONG WORDS JEROO COX'S HUSBAND HAS URGED PEOPLE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE HATRED THAT KILTER HAITI SAID DOESN'T HAVE A CREED RACE OR RELIGION IT'S POISONOUS
WHERE WE HAVE TO BEGIN AS USER STRESSED IS BY DEALING WITH WHAT MIGHT BE INSIDE US
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BISHOP RICHARD HARRIS THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT ON THURSDAY ON THIS PROGRAMME A CONSERVATIVE M.P. CHRIS FELT CAUGHT FOUR GO VIA THAMES LINK RAIL WHICH RUNS THE SOUTHERN RAIL SERVICE BETWEEN BRIGHTON AND LONDON TO BE STRIPPED OF THEIR FRANCHISE GOBY ATTEMPT LINK IS THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST FRANCHISE NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL THE RAILWAY JOURNEYS MADE FROM THEIR TRAINS
AND IT'S ALSO THE WORST THE BRIGHTON SERVICES PARTICULARLY AWFUL AND IT'S BEEN MADE WORSE BY INDUSTRIAL ACTION BY MEMBERS OF THE R. A. N. T. UNION THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT NEW RULES ON DRIVER ONLY TRAINS WE ASKED PASSENGERS OR VICTORIA STATION LAST NIGHT WHETHER THEIR JOURNEYS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE DISRUPTION AND WHAT THEY WOULD SAY TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE TRAIN OPERATING COMPANY
FIND SOME STAFF THAT WILL DO THE JOB PROPERLY THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT I'M SURE WOULD LOVE TO WORK FOR YOU YOU GO AND FIND THEM
A SYMBOL OF THE CHANGE OF MUSE TO ARRIVE ON TIME AND IT'S ALWAYS LATE EVERY DAY I MISS MY CHILDREN GOING TO BED
ONE TRAIN CANCELLED I'M AWAY ON MONDAY THE FOLLOWING DAY IT WAS DELAYED A BIT OF A LOT
AN AWFUL TERRIBLE SERVICE SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE MY TRAIN WAS CANCELLED TWICE THIS WEEK JUST READY NOT GOOD ENOUGH RESOURCES OR SUDDENLY TO THE FRANCHISE EVER TAKEN
WELL DON'T CRY THERE IS THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF GOBI A THAMES LINK RAIL WHICH RUNS A SOUTHERN RAILWAY SERVICE AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE I AM ACUTELY AWARE OF THE DISRUPTION THAT WE HAVE CAUSED MANY MANY CUSTOMERS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS THAT'S PRIMARILY BEEN DOWN TO THE INDUSTRIAL ACTION BEING TAKEN BY THE TRADE UNIONS UP UNTIL THE DISPUTE STARTED WE WERE SEEING A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE WE HAD BEEN WORKING VERY HARD IN COLLABORATIVELY WITH NETWORK RAIL
TO IMPROVE SERVICES ON THE PRIOR TO MAINLINE AND THOSE IMPROVEMENTS WERE STARTING TO COME THROUGH IT'S THE INDUSTRIAL ACTION THAT ARE SET US BACK IN THE LAST FOUR TO FIVE WAIT WHAT THE R. M. T. SAY THAT THEY HAVE EVIDENCE OF THIRTY THREE TRAINS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED WHERE STAFF HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE AND HAVE BEEN READY TO WORK IS THAT TRUE OR FALSE
CLEARLY ANY ALLEGATIONS LIKE THAT WE WILL INVESTIGATE FULLY AND WE WILL INVESTIGATE EVERY SYLLABLE TRAIN MUST BE BODY LET GIVE IAN AND AN INDIVIDUAL TRAY THEY ARE SAYING THE SEVEN TEN BRIGHTON TO LEWES ON JUNE THE FIRST ARRIVED IN GOOD TIME THE TRAIN THE DRIVER
THE GUARD ALL THERE THE TRAIN WERE SHOWN US CANCELLED DUE TO A SHORTAGE OF TRAINED CROUTE EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE WAS THERE IT IS THERE
TRUE OR FALSE IT'S SIMPLY LUDICROUS TO SUGGEST THAT WE WOULD CANCEL TRAINED DELIBERATELY RIGHT SO THEY DO IT'S A LOT AT SO HE'S ALIVE FROM THE UNI WHAT SEEMS CLEAR ABOUT SO WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WE WERE J.L.S. A JERRY COMPLICATED CITY WHAT WE'LL GET TO THE COMPLICATIONS AND A SECOND ON THIS ALLEGATION WITH HER WHICH IS VERY SPECIFIC INCLUDING SPECIFIC TRAINS BUT IS BEING MADE BY THE UNION
AND IF M.P.S WANT TO INVESTIGATE AND TALK TO THE DRIVER ON THAT TRAIN ET-CETERA YOU ARE SAYING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE THAT YOU HAVE NOT CANCELLED HER TRAIN
EVEN THOUGH THE CREW HAVE BEEN THERE TO RUN IT SO WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT TRAINED WILL BE CANCELLED BUT WHEN WE CANCELLED TRAINS IT'S BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION FOR RUNNIN SERVICES LATER ON IN THE DAY POSSIBLE TO GO BACK TO DEPOTS ARE TRAINED OPERATE IN A VERY VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM AND WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF SERVICES
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND INDEED ON FOLLOW WINDOWS SO THAT'S USUALLY SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TRAINS ARE CANCELLED WHEN THE DRIVER AND CONDUCTOR ARE THERE BUT IT IS DONE BECAUSE OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN LATER ON IN THE DAY TRYING TO GET CANCELLED FOR MANY MANY REASONS TRAINS GET CANCELLED TO TO BALANCE THE SERVICE LATER ON THAT OF COURSE HE SHOULDN'T SAY TO PEOPLE IT'S BEEN CANCELLED BECAUSE OF A SHORTAGE OF TRAINED PRO WHEN YOU'VE ACTUALLY CANCELLED IT MANAGED TO SERVICE LATER ON SO IF YOU DID SAY IT WAS A SHORTAGE OF TRAINED CREW THAT WOULD BE UNTRUE
SO IN IN THE LAST FOUR WEEKS WE WE'VE HAD A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CANCELLATIONS BECAUSE OF SHORTAGE OF TRYING CRAIG THAT IS A FACT LEMME ASK YOU A WIDER QUESTION
AND LITERALLY ABOUT THE MISMANAGEMENT OF THE DISASTROUS CONDITIONS THAT PEOPLE ON YOUR SERVICES OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES IN PARTICULAR TRYING TO GET HOME AT NIGHT ON DEAN INTO WORK IN THE MORNING WHAT THOSE PEOPLE AND VICTORIA WERE SUGGEST HE WAS YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO EMPLOY THE PEOPLE AT LEAST TO HELP WHEN THINGS GO WRONG YOU DON'T SEEM TO DO THAT EITHER
O.K. SO I AM VERY VERY SORRY FOR THE DISRUPTION THAT WE HAVE CAUSE AND I'M ACUTELY AWARE OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE HAVING AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE ROBUST RECRUITMENT PROGRAMMES IN PLACE WHAT WAS AFFECTED SERVICES IN THE LAST FOUR WEEKS ARE TWO THINGS
AN INCREASE IN SICKNESS AMONGST CONDUCTORS AND ALSO A DECREASE IN THEIR WILLINGNESS FOR SOME DRIVERS IN SOME OF OUR DEPOTS TO WORK OVERTIME THAT'S HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO RUN THE SERVICE IN A RELIABLE WAY BUT IF PEOPLE WOULD WORK OVERTIME EITHER ON THE PLATFORMS ARE IN THE TRAINS YOU WOULD PAY THE MONEY FOR THEM TO DO IT WOULD YOU IT'S NOT A MATTER OF YOU SAVING MONEY BY NOT PAYING THE STAFF THE EXTRA CASH TO DO THE WORK
ABSOLUTELY NOT LET'S BE CRYSTAL CLEAR THERE IS NO OVERTIME BAN SINCE SINCE THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF APRIL WE HAVE COVERED THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN CONDUCTOR TURNS FREE REST DAY WORKIN THAT SUGGESTS TO ME THERE IS NO OVERTIME BAN IN PLACE AND YOU WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY HAPPY JUST TO MAKE COMPLETE IF PEOPLE ON THE PLATFORMS AS WELL HAVE MORE PEOPLE WERE NEEDED ON THE PLATFORMS IF HE COULD FIND THE START OF YOU WOULD BE HAPPY TO PAY THEM
ABSOLUTELY DAVID BROWN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OR GO AHEAD WAS THE COMPANY THAT OWNS YOUR FRANCHISE WAS PAID IT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN PAID TWO MILLION POUNDS LAST YEAR INCLUDING BONUSES IS THAT ACCEPTABLE
THAT THAT'S A MATTER FOR OUR BOARD WHAT MY FOCUS IS ON WELL IT'S ABOUT ME HIM THE PIZZA GO ON YOU'RE O.K. TOMORROW BASIS IT'S NOT REALLY JUST A MATTER OF YOUR BOARD IS IT IT'S A MATTER OF FAIRNESS AND A MATTER OF OF INTENSE INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE WHO USE YOUR TRAINS AND I JUST WONDER WHETHER YOU THINK THAT KIND OF PAY PACKET IS THE RIGHT SORT OF PAY PACKET GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING
WHAT MY CUSTOMERS WANT ME TO DO AND WHAT I'M EMPLOYED TO DO IS TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE AND TO SORT OF GET THINGS BACK TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL AND TO DO THAT
COULD YOU DO WOULD YOU BE ALLOWED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO DO A DEAL WITH THE R. EMPTY IN OTHER WORDS WHEN OTHER SUGGESTIONS BEHIND THIS LOT OF COMPLICATED SUGGESTED ANOTHER OF THE SUGGESTIONS IS THAT ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT IS BEHIND THE SCENES PULLING THE STRINGS HERE AND YOU CAN'T DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
SO LET'S BE CLEAR ON THIS ARE THE PROPOSALS WE'VE PUT TO THE R.M.T. AND TWO HOURS LEFT A REASONABLE PROPOSALS
THEY ARE VERY SIMPLY ABOUT EVOLVE IN THE ROLE OF THE CONDUCTOR WHERE SKIN ARE CONDUCTORS TO DO LESS WORK WERE ASKED THEM NOT TO OPERATE A DOOR
WE ARE GOING TO BE RETAINED PEOPLE ON TRAINS NOBODY'S GOING TO LOSE HER JOB NOBODY'S GOING TO LOSE ANY PAY AND IT'S A SAFE METHOD OF OPERATION
SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THEY ARE REASONABLE PROPOSALS BUT WHAT SOME PEOPLE SUGGEST IS THAT YOU'RE FORCED TO TAKE A HARD LINE ON IT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO INTRODUCE THAT KIND OF WORKING AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THEY'RE USING YOU AS A AS A TROJAN HORSE
SO ANY HARD LINE THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN THIS BEING TAKEN BY THE TRADE UNIONS THEY HAVE DRAWN A LINE IN THE SAND LAST AUTUMN LAST NOVEMBER THEY MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE INDUSTRY THAT THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT ANY EXTENSION BUT YOU'RE NOT ON THE GOVERNMENT PRESSURE TO TO TO BE TOUGH ON THIS YOU CAN TAKE THE DECISIONS THAT YOU THINK YOU SEE FIT TO TECH SAID THE DECISIONS WE ARE TAKEN THEY'RE MAKING BECAUSE THEY ARE THE RIGHT DECISIONS ARE THE RIGHT DECISIONS FOR THE CUSTOMER WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT CONSERVATIVE M.P. WHO SAYS THE FRANCHISE SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF YOU
I DO NOT SEE ANY BENEFIT IN CHANGE IN THE NAME ABOVE THE DOOR NO IT'S NOT THAT THOUGH HE SAYS THAT THE FRANCHISES TO BIG THAN THAT THE COMPLICATIONS A SO HUGE IT ACTUALLY IT'S JUST IT'S JUST FOOLISH TO ALLUDE TO GET ANY COMPANY TO BE RUNNING THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE BURNT BROKEN UP SO THE FRANCHISE WAS PUT TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THE DELIVERY OF THE TEMPS LINK PROGRAMME AT THE HUGE SORT OF SEVEN BILLION POUND INVESTMENT THAT WILL TRANSFORM JOURNEYS FOR CUSTOMERS IN SOUTH EAST LONDON SO
SO THAT SO THE FRANCHISE WILL DO THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FOCUSING ON IMPROVING THINGS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WILL DO THAT COLLABORATIVELY WITH NETWORK RAIL AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT OVER THE FORTHCOMING MONTHS DOWN GRAB THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF GO VIA TERMS LIKE THAT THANKS

I'VE SEEN THE WAY IN WHICH HE'S ENGAGED WITH PEOPLE THE WAY IN WHICH SHE WAS VERY EASY WITH PEOPLE SHE WAS A WOMAN OF THIS COMMUNITY THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF PASSION FOR CAUSES AND COMPASSION FOR PETE
I SAW SOMEONE WHO WAS UTTERLY ENGAGE WITH
ONE OF MISSUS COX'S CONSTITUENTS WHO WAS OUT THE VIGIL SPOKE OF THE HELP THE M.P. HAD GIVEN HER

RUSSIA HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONVINCE THE R. DOUBLE A. F. THAT IT'S ANTI DOPING PROGRAMME IS NOW REAL BURST AND ITS ATHLETES SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE IN RIO THAT AFTER A DAMNING REPORT WHICH UNCOVERED A LONG RUNNING SYSTEM OF STATE SPONSORED CHEATING A TASK FORCE WAS DISPATCHED TO MONITOR RUSSIA'S ATTEMPTS AT RECTIFYING THE SITUATION ITS FINDINGS THAT WILL FORM THE BASIS OF TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT
THERE'S PLENTY OF SUPPORT FOR THE BAND TO BE UPHELD ESPECIALLY AFTER PROBLEMS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY THIS WEEK THEY INCLUDED FAKE URINE SAMPLES ATHLETES RUNNING AWAY FROM THE TESTERS AND INTIMIDATION FROM SECRET SERVICE AGENTS BUT OTHERS SAY PUNISHING A WHOLE NATION IS EXCESSIVE AND UNFAIR ON THOSE WHO WERE INNOCENT
IT'S A HUGE DECISION FOR THE DOUBLE A. HAVE PRESIDENT LORD COE HE'S BEEN UNDER PRESSURE TO CLEAN UP THE SPORT OF VIRTUALLY SINCE HE GOT THE JOB LAST AUGUST AMID ALLEGATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN DENIED THAT HE KNEW MORE THAN HE WAS LETTING ON ABOUT THE DOPING SCANDAL
LAST YEAR LORD COE TOLD THE COMMONS CULTURE MEDIA AND SPORT COMMITTEE THAT HIS VICE PRESIDENT HE HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF THE SCANDAL NOW AN INVESTIGATION BY THE B.B.C.'S PANORAMA PROGRAMME HAS SUGGESTED THAT HE'D BEEN SENT AN EMAIL WHICH DETAILED ALLEGATIONS ABOUT A RUSSIAN ATHLETE WHO WAS NOT ONLY CHEATING BUT WAS ALSO BEING BLACKMAILED BY OFFICIALS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JESSE NORMAN TOLD US IT WAS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THEY'D BE RECALLING LORD COE TO CLARIFY THE MATTER
WHEN LORD KERR APPEARED IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE IN DECEMBER HIS ANSWERS WERE VERY GENERAL ONCE IN MANY WAYS THE IDEA THAT HE COULD HAVE RECEIVED THIS EMAIL AND NOT HAVE OPENED IT HAVING BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE IDEA I WILL HEAR FROM THE SENIOR POSITION AT THAT POINT BUT FOR SIX YEARS
AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF INDIVIDUAL CASES OF DISHONESTY AND CORRUPTION IS VERY VERY DISTURBED

GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE HORROR AND MANY OF THE REFUGEE CHILDREN IN EUROPE HAVE FLED ISN'T IT TIME TO END THE GOVERNMENT'S SHAMEFUL REFUSAL TO GIVE THREE THOUSAND UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN SANCTUARY HERE IN THE
CERTAINLY MY EXPERIENCE OF BEING A PARENT AND I THINK HISTORY FOR MEN AND WOMEN IS THAT I HAVE CHANGED BEYOND MEASURE TO THAT EXPERIENCE IT'S MADE ME UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS TO BE PARENT AND MANAGED TRYING TO RAISE AN INCOME AND BE A GUN MOM AND BALANCE THAT WITH CARE AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ELDERLY RELATIVES IT'S CHANGED ME IMMEASURABLY AND I THINK HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE
IN THIS PLACE IS GOING TO MAKE US BETTER LAWMAKERS SO WE HAVE TO ATTRACT WOMEN AND PARENTS WOMEN AND MEN INTO THIS PLACE AND I ALSO WANT TO BE A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR MY HOME TOWN IN YORKSHIRE BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE A MUM AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE ANYONE IN THIS PLACE HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO BE BOTH
THE WORDS OF JOE COX WE'RE JOINED NOW BY TWO PEOPLE WHO KNEW HER TO FELLOW LABOUR M.P.S BOTH OF THEM WEST YORKSHIRE M.P.S YVETTE COOPER AND HOLLY LYNCH GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING MORNING A SAD OCCASION TO BE TALKING TO YOU AND YVETTE COOPER I KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT THE VIGIL HERE IN FIRST OR LAST NIGHT HOW WILL YOU REMEMBER
AS SOMEBODY WHO SEES LIFE AND SHOOK IT UP AND IT IS UNBEARABLE TO FEEL THAT SHE'S HAD HERS STOLEN AWAY WHO'S IT JUST VERY MOVING LISTENING TO IT JO SPEAKING IN HER OWN WORDS AND I THINK MOST OF US
STRUGGLING TO PROCESS IT AND THE SHOCK HASN'T REALLY SUNK IN THIS SHE NEVER OPTED FOR THE EASY PART SICK SHE WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE SHE WOULD JUST WALK TOWARDS PROBLEMS RATHER THAN WALK AWAY FROM THAT AND YOU SAW HER DO THAT ON CHAMPIONING THE CAUSE OF REFUGEES WHO ARE FLEEING FROM CONFLICT OR FROM PERSECUTION BUT ON SO MANY OTHER CAUSES AS WELL AND LISTENING TO HER TALK ABOUT IT
THE COMBINING THE LIFE OF AN M.P. IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT SHE PURSUED AS WELL AS HER FAMILY LIFE I REMEMBER THAT IN FACT WHEN SHE STOOD WHEN SHE FIRST WENT FOR THE SELECTION IN HER HOME TOWN SHE THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT IT BECAUSE SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT IN THE AGE OF HER CHILDREN AND YET AGAIN SHE NEVER TOOK THE EASY PATH SHE WHAT SHE SEES A CHALLENGE AND WE WILL ENCOURAGE HER TO DO THAT HOLLY LYNCH HOW WILL YOU REMEMBER
ME MEAN JOB BOTH ELECTED AT THE SAME TIME AND COMING INTO WESTMINSTER IT IS A FUNNY PLACE ACTUALLY TO TRY AND GET YOUR HEAD WRAPPED AROUND BUT ACTUALLY DURE SHE ALWAYS JUST SEEM TO HAVE A REAL CLARITY THIS HONOUR EXPERIENCES ABOUT WHAT SHE WAS THERE TO ACHIEVE AS A VET SAID SHE WAS VERY DYNAMIC IN THE WAY THAT SHE DID THAT SHE DID IT WITH A PASSION WITH A COMPASSION FOR THE PEOPLE THAT SHE REPRESENTED
BOTH IN HER HOME TOWN IN HER CONSTITUENCY BUT MUCH FURTHER AFIELD RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD AS WELL AND SHE WAS ABLE TO USE HER HER PERSONALITY AND EXPERIENCE TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE RIGHT ACROSS THE CHAMBER AND YOU SAW THAT IN THE IN THE COMMENTS AND REMARKS FROM M.P.S OF ALL POLITICAL PERSUASIONS YESTERDAY
COULD WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT PARLIAMENTARY LIFE IS FOR PARENTS FOR MOTHERS AND HERE SHE IS A WOMAN WITH VERY YOUNG CHILDREN AND YET MANAGING TO MAKE SUCH A MARK IN ONLY A YEAR AS AN M.P.
SHE WAS BRILLIANT AND IT JUST IT'S SEIZED ON THINGS WAS FIERCE ADVOCATE FOR THE THINGS THAT SHE BELIEVED IN BUT ALSO FIERCELY PROUD OF HER FAMILY NO IT WAS
KINGSLEY SHE WAS TEXTING ABOUT HIM HIM ABOUT THIS WEEK WITH THINGS HER FAMILY WERE DOING I KNOW WHETHER THE KIDS WERE ILL AS WELL AS CAUSES THAT SHE WAS CHAMPIONING AS WELL AS THE CAMPAIGNING IN THE REFERENDUM SO IS SHE NEVER STOPPED DOING BOTH AND DOING BOTH BRILLIANTLY JUST HAVE A FANTASTIC MUM AS WELL AS AN AMAZING POLITICIAN HOLLY LYNCH
WHERE ARE YOU AS AS IN PEAS AND YOU YOU'RE MUCH NEWER TO IT THEN YVETTE COOPER BUT OF OF THE OF THE RISKS THAT ARE
AN INEVITABLE PART OF OF YOUR PROFESSIONAL LIFE WHEN YOU IT'S YOUR JOB TO BE IN CONTACT WITH WITH STRANGERS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC
YEAH IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR US ALL OF COURSE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAYS TO BE A GOOD M.P. TO BE GOOD AT YOUR JOB YOU HAVE TO BE ROOTED IN YOUR CONSTITUENCY YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOURSELF AS AVAILABLE AS POSSIBLE TO MEET WITH PEOPLE THAT IS THE NATURE OF YOUR WORK TO HEAR PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS TO TRANSPORT AND THREW IT IN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU
SEE INSTANCES LIKE THIS WHICH IS ACTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED SHE'D THEN THINK ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE TO MANAGE THOSE SAFETY RISKS BUT ALSO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE WAY THAT I'VE JUST DESCRIBED IT IS INCREDIBLE SOCIETY NOW DO YOU THINK THOSE RISKS THAT BALLET
I DON'T THINK WE CAN YOU KNOW I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FORGET ACTUALLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO JOE AND AS WE'VE ALL SAID IT'S INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY SADE I THINK YOU DO HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THE SAFETY OF YOUR STUFF ALL TIMES AS WELL WHO ARE QUITE OFTEN WITH YOU WHEN YOU'RE MEETING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND YOU CANNOT AVOID TAKING THESE THESE THESE RISKS AND CONCERNS VERY SERIOUSLY BUT TO NOT LET IT STOP YOU FROM BEING AT THE EFFECTIVE M.P. THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS DESERVE IT AS WELL
YVETTE COOPER YOUR FELLOW LABOUR M.P. RACHEL REEVES HAS CLOSED HER CONSTITUENCY OFFICE TODAY WITH SAFETY IN MIND FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF JOE COX'S IS THAT SOMETHING THAT
YOU COULD IMAGINE FOLLOWING OR WOULD OTHERS
I THINK THEY ALL TAKE THE ADVICE OF THE POLICE ON THIS IN ANY SITUATION WE COULD WE WILL ALL OF US
TELL YOU THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR M.P.S TO BE EMBEDDED IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT IF YOU GO DOWN TO ASDA SO ALL STOPS YOU TO TELL YOU ABOUT A PROBLEM WITH THEIR NEIGHBOUR OR THE FACT THAT MUM'S BACK GARDEN IS FLOODED AND YOU LIKE TO THE DETAILS DOWN THE BACK OF A TILL RECEIPT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S KIND OF
DAILY DISCUSSION THAT YOU HAVE IN THE CONSTITUENCY IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND NO ONE WOULD EVER WANT TO PUT THAT AT RISK
AT THE SAME TIME AS HOLLY SAID WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAFF ARE PROPERLY PROTECTED IF THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL CASES BUT IT'S ALSO WORTH WON'T BE SO MANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ENCOUNTERS THAT YOU HAVE WITH PEOPLE ARE WARM ALL OF THE TIME THESE ARE THE AWFUL CASES THAT THAT THAT SUDDENLY HIT THE HEADLINES AND BREAK EVERYBODY'S HEARTS BUT AT THE
THE VIGIL LAST NIGHT THERE WAS SO MANY PEOPLE WHO I WAS HUGGING WHO WERE STRANGERS BUT IT'S THERE BECAUSE THEY HAD MET JOE MAYBE JUST ONCE MAYBE TWICE BUT WHERE THERE'S A RESULT OF HER KINDNESS THEY WERE THERE I WANTED TO PAY TRIBUTE
WALLY LYNCHED OR DID YOU EVER TALK TO JOE COX ABOUT ABOUT WHAT SHE MADE OF WHAT YOU BOTH MADE HIS NEW M. PEAS OF THE NATURE OF OF POLITICAL DISCOURSE THE WALL HOW
PEOPLE TALK TO THE M.P.S THERE THE SORT OF FIRE THAT IS SOMETIMES ADDRESSED IN THE MUMMY IN AND PARTICULARLY THE TONE OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD RECENTLY IN THE REFERENDUM
YEAH WE HAD QUITE SIMILAR CONSTITUENCIES ACTUALLY IN BATTLING SPENDIN MY CONSTITUENTS OF HALIFAX WE WOULD REGULARLY MEET TO COMPARE NOTES WHAT BEST PRACTICE ABOUT WHAT THINGS WORK IN WHAT WHAT THINGS MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT OVERCOME SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE SHARED IN OUR CONSTITUENCIES I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN A BIT TAKEN ABACK BY HOW THE
NATURE IN THE TOUR OF THIS REFERENDUM IN PARTICULAR HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE IN HAVING CONVERSATIONS SENSIBLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT MEAN
WE HAVE TO GET USED TO THAT AND I KNOW WE BOTH SHARE CONCERNS AND GO BACK TO THE POINT THAT HOW DO YOU BE A VERY GOOD EFFECTIVE M. P. DEAL WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE REALLY STRONG OPINIONS THEY ARE DIFFERENT TO YOURS THIS IS THE NATURE OF POLITICS IT'S THE NATURE OF DEMOCRACY
WHICH WE BELIEVE IN FIRST AND FOREMOST IN YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO DEALING IN AND WORKING IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AS YVETTE SAYS ALMOST EVERYBODY THAT JUST COME TO SEE YOU HAS GOT A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AND ONE WANTS TO WORK WITH YOU IN A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AND HELPFUL WAY TO TRY AND OVERCOME THOSE PROBLEMS BUT YEAH WE WE ALL NEED TO WORK OUT HOW WE CAN CHANGE
THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVING AROUND POLITICS THAT WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS RESPECTFUL APPROACH TO DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO SHARE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW THAT ALLOWS US TO
CARRY ON IT AND THEN INTO KEEP DOING OUR JOBS IN A WAY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL ARRIVED IN WESTMINSTER FOR
YVETTE COOPER IT IS THIS A MOMENT DO YOU THINK THAT WITH THAT WE THAT HAS TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT THE NATURE OF OF THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE ABOUT POLITICIANS IS IS IT BECOMING TOO
WE DON'T YET KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE BUT
THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN VITRIOL I THINK HIM IN PUBLIC DEBATE SOME OF THAT'S DIRECTED TOWARDS M.P.S BUT SOME OF IT IS PEOPLE DIRECTING IT AT EACH OTHER AND THAT'S NEVER HEALTHY LOOK PASSION IS GOOD AND DIP DISAGREEMENTS ESSENTIAL BUT AND IT WAS PROBABLY INEVITABLE ANGER BUT THERE IS I THINK A FEEL THAT THERE IS MORE NASTINESS AND IN PUBLIC DEBATE NOW
AND NONE OF US WOULD WANT TO SEE THAT IT HAS A FEELING TOO THAT IF YOU THINK BACK ONLY FOUR YEARS SINCE THE OLYMPICS WHERE WE HAVE THIS WILL CLIMB OF EVERYBODY FEELING PROUD TOGETHER CELEBRATING IDEA I DIVERSITY FEELING CONFIDENT AS A COUNTRY AND
IT DOES FEEL THAT THE THE PUBLIC MOOD OF THE PUBLIC ATMOSPHERE ABOUT DEBATE HAS CHANGED VERY SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE THEN BUT IT IS ACTUALLY WHAT A SHOW AND AND DEBATE HAS GOT TWO NASTY
I EAT THERE OR THERE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME VITRIOL AS PART OF THAT DEBATE WHICH WHICH IS VERY WHICH CAN BE VERY DESTRUCTIVE BUT I THINK THE THING ABOUT JOEY IS THAT SHE WOULD ALWAYS OF HAD STOOD AGAINST HER THAT THAT SHE WOULD
ALWAYS HAVE ARGUED FOR BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER FOR HEALTHY DEBATE BUT FOR UNITING PEOPLE AND IT'S WHAT HER HUSBAND SAID YESTERDAY AS WELL THAT WE CANNOT LET THE HATRED THAT KILLED JOE WIN WE HAVE TO STAND AGAINST THAT HEDGEROW HATRED AND WE SHOULD REMEMBER HIS WORDS I THINK TODAY
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT JOE COX'S MEMORY AND HER CONTRIBUTION TO OUR PUBLIC LIFE SHOULD BE HONOURED
SHE WAS AN ABSOLUTE HERO SHE REALLY WAS AS HER SAID SHE JUST HAD THAT SORT OF DYNAMISM AND CLARITY ABOUT SHE WAS HERE TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN WESTMINSTER AND SHE'S GOING TO USE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT
SHE DID HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN SHE HAD A FAMILY AND THAT WAS ALWAYS A BALANCING ACT FOR JOE BUT ACTUALLY SHE MADE IT LOOK SO EASY AS WELL SHE WAS SOMEBODY THAT REALLY SET THE EXAMPLE FOR THE REST OF US THE NEW INTAKE OF TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT HERE SO IT HERE'S HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE HERE SO YOU REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW WE WON'T BE HERE FOREVER SO YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY WHILE WE'RE IN WESTMINSTER
TO MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE SHE DID IT WITH A SMILE BUT WITH JUST AN EFFICIENCY AND BASED ON HER VAST EXPERIENCE THAT ONE OR JUST THE RESPECT OF COLLEAGUES FROM RIGHT ACROSS THE CHAMBER AND WE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER HER LAUGHING
I THINK HER HER EYES SPARKLING SHE WAS ALWAYS THE HOST OF EVERY PARTY SHOULD FIND THE FUNNY SHE WOULD BE JOKING ABOUT CALLUM A LOTION FOR HER KIDS CHICKENPOX OR SOMETHING BIZARRE SOMEBODY HAD SAID TO HER IN A CORRIDOR OR IN THE CHAMBER AND EXACT VIVACITY THAT ENTHUSIASM FOR LIFE AS WELL AS HER DETERMINATION TO PUT THAT ENERGY TO GOOD USE TO CHANGING PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT'S WHAT ALL OF US REMEMBER
YVETTE COOPER M. P. AND HOLLY LET'S AND THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT ONE OF THE MOST DARING RESCUES IN THE HISTORY OF THE SOUTH POLE IS GOING TO BE ATTEMPTED OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS OR WEEKS IN THE BRUTAL PITCH DARK POLAR WINTER A TINY PLANE IS GOING TO TRY TO REACH ONE OF THE RESEARCH STATIONS TO BRING THAT ONE POSSIBLY TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE ILL AND NEED TO GET OUT PETER WEST IS FROM THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION WHICH RUNS THE SOUTH POLE STATIONS THAT THE PILOTS HAVE GOT TO TRY TO REACH
IT'S NOT A VERY EASY THING TO DO AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN TWO FLIGHTS INTO SOUTH PAUL AT THIS IN THE WINTER ONE IN TWO THOUSAND WON ONE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE BUT WHAT IS BEING DONE IS THAT WHEN THE FLIGHT ACTUALLY GIRLS WHICH IT HAS NOT YET TO SOUTH POLE IT WILL BE A VERY SMALL AIRCRAFT
FLYING OVER A CARTON AT THE SIZE OF THE U.S. AND MEXICO COMBINED IN VERY DARK AND VERY COLD CONDITIONS AND PRESUMABLY EXPERIENCING ITSELF SOME DANGER AND DARING
WELL AS I SAY IT'S NOT A ROUTINE FLIGHT I'M NOT A PILOT SO I CAN'T QUANTIFY THAT DANGER FOR YOU BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE USUALLY DO AND THAT ONE OF THE DECISIONS THAT WAS MADE TO SEND THIS FLIGHT WAS TO WEIGH THE RISKS FOR THE PILOTS AGAINST THE HEALTH OF THE PATIENT WHO NEEDS THE TREATMENT
BECAUSE IN THE PAST THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE HAVEN'T THERE IN THE SOUTH POLE WHO HAVE DEVELOPED ILLNESSES THERE BIT OF HAD TO COPE LOCALLY INCLUDING A WOMAN WHO WHO FOUND THAT SHE HAD BREAST CANCER BUT TREATED HERSELF
CORRECT IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE DATA IN THE ORSON DID DEVELOP BREAST CANCER SHE WAS TREATED IN PARTS THROUGH USE OF TELEMEDICINE SOME DRUGS WERE AIRDROP TO HER AND SHE CAME OUT OF THE STATION IN OCTOBER ABOUT A WEEK OR SO BEFORE THE FLIGHTS WOULD NORMALLY GO IN TO OPEN UP SOUTHPORT THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT AIRCRAFT WAS THAT ARE FLOWN BY THE NATIONAL PARK FOR US
AND PRESUMABLY THEY WILL PICK A TIME BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THAT IT'S DARK AND VERY COLD BUT BUT ALSO VERY STORM ISN'T IT THEY'LL NEED TO PICK A TIME WHEN THEY CAN GET IN AND OUT WITHOUT INCOME ENCOUNTERING TOO MUCH IN THE WAY OR BAD WEATHER THAT'S CORRECT IN WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE WEATHER MYSELF OBVIOUSLY BUT WE HAVE EXPERTS WHO WERE LOOKING AT THOSE FORECASTS YEAH IT'S SO IT'S NOT JUST THE COLD AND DARK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT IT IS A CONTINENT AND THERE ARE CAN'T NEVILLE WEATHER SYSTEMS TO KEEP AN EYE
IF IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO FLY IN AND OUT
WHICH WE HOPE NOW THAT IT DOES BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IT DID DOES THAT CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE OF THE JOB THE KIND OF CULTURAL MOST OF GOING TO THE SOUTH POLE BECAUSE IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THOUGHT HASN'T IT YOU GO THERE AND YOU REALLY ARE STUCK IT'S LIKE GOING TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION OR SOMEWHERE YOU'D THERE'S NO EASY WAY BACK IF IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO FLY THERE IF THAT BECOMES SOMETHING LIKE ROUTINE IT'S A DIFFERENT SORT OF PLACE ISN'T IT
WELL I WOULD I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT THREE FLIGHTS IN FIFTEEN YEARS HE'S IS FAR FROM ROUTINE YOU MAY BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT WE ARE FLYING THIS SUMMER SOME FLIGHTS INTO MCMURDO STATION WHICH IS A WEATHER STATION ON THE COAST AND FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE U.S. PRESENCE IN AN ARTICLE WHICH IS MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT IN THERE AND OUR SUMMER THEIR WINTER SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S CHANGING LHASA WELL VERY BEST OF LUCK TO THE PILOTS AND TO THE PEOPLE THEY'RE BRINGING UP PETER WEST THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US

AND THE WEATHER IT'S GOING TO BE DRY IN THE NORTH WEST TODAY BUT MUCH OF ENGLAND AND WALES WILL SEE A MIXTURE OF SUNNY SPELLS AND FURTHER HEAVY OFTEN THUNDERY DOWNPOURS
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WITH MICHELLE HUSSEIN BURSTALL AND JUSTIN WEBB IN LONDON AND THE TIME IS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE AND IT'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM CAROLINE NICHOLLS THE JEWELS HAVE BEEN HELD TO REMEMBER THE MURDERED LABOUR M.P. JOE COX WHO WAS SHOT AND STABBED IN THE VILLAGE OF BURST IN HER BATLEY AND SPENT CONSTITUENCY YESTERDAY OUTSIDE THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT M.P.S PLACED FLOWERS AND LIT CANDLES NEXT TO A LARGE PICTURE OF THEIR COLLEAGUE IN BURSTALL HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE PACKED INTO THE PARISH CHURCH
HER ATTACKER IS REPORTED TO HAVE SHOUTED BRITAIN FIRST OR PUT BRITAIN FIRST AT LEAST TWICE A FIFTY TWO YEAR OLD MAN NAMED LOCALLY AS TOMMY MAYOR IS IN CUSTODY
ANOTHER LABOUR M.P. IN WEST YORKSHIRE YVETTE COOPER TOLD US JOE COX WAS SOMEONE WHO'D SEIZED LIFE AND SHOOK IT UP SHE'D WALKS TOWARDS PROBLEMS RATHER THAN WALKING AWAY AND IT WAS UNBEARABLE BUT SHE'D HAD HER LIFE STOLEN FROM HER
LABOUR HAS HELD THE SEAT OF TOOTING IN SOUTH LONDON IN A BY ELECTION TRIGGERED BY THE RESIGNATION OF SIDIQUE KHAN AFTER HE WAS ELECTED MAYOR OF LONDON RESENT ALAN KHAN IS IT KRIS LABOUR'S MAJORITY OVER THE CONSERVATIVES BY THREE AND A HALF THOUSAND
TO CANCER DRUGS WHICH UNLEASHED THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ON TUMOURS TO BE FUNDED BY THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND IN TRIALS THE COMBINATION THERAPY SHRANK THE MOST AGGRESSIVE TYPE OF SKIN CANCER MELANOMA IN MOST PATIENTS
A MAN HAS DIED AT A POTASH MINE NEAR THE VILLAGE OF BULL BEING READ KHAN CLEVELAND IT'S THOUGHT THERE WAS A GAS EXPLOSION UNDERGROUND THANK YOU THE TIME TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE A PIONEERING PAIR OF CANCER DRUGS THAT UNLEASHED THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ON TUMOURS ARE GOING TO BE PAID FOR BY THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND AND TRIALS THE COMBINATION THERAPY SHRANK THE MOST AGGRESSIVE TYPE OF SKIN CANCER IN MOST PATIENTS
THE DECISION TO PROVE THE DRUGS IS ONE OF THE FASTEST IN N.H.S. HISTORY IT'S GOING TO INFLUENCE DECISIONS RIGHT ACROSS THE U.K. PROFESSOR PETER JOHNSON IS ON THE LINE CHIEF COMMISSIONER CANCER RESEARCH U.K. GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JUST AND THIS REALLY DOES SOUND LIKE A DRUG THAT IS GOING TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE TO QUITE A FEW PEOPLE VERY QUICK
YES THE RESULTS OF THESE TREATMENTS FOR CANCER JUST KEEP ON COMING AND WE'VE SEEN QUITE A LOT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND COMBINING THESE TWO DIFFERENT ANTIBODIES WHICH CUT THE BRAKES AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE PROCESS SEEMS TO STEP UP TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR TREATMENT SO THAT AS YOU SAY ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE WE SEE A SHRINKAGE OF THEIR SKIN CANCERS SO I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT CERTAIN AND A DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA OF IMMUNOTHERAPY THAT WE WERE ALREADY EXCITED
YES WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WITH UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHO'S MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT AND VERY IMPORTANTLY IT DEALING WITH THE SORT OF SIDE EFFECTS THAT YOU CAN GET WHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM SETS OFF BUT IT IS GREAT NEWS AND IT'S GREAT NEWS THAT NICE HAS BEEN ABLE TO MOVE SO QUICKLY ON THIS ONE YES AND THEY HAVE HAVEN'T THEY BUT AS THIS IS A REALLY SPEEDY DECISION MUCH BIGGER THAN ANYTHING THEY'VE THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND PRESUMABLY WELCOME
ABSOLUTELY WITH WE'VE HAD OUR ISSUES WITH NICE IN THE PAST WHEN IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE THE RESULTS FROM CANCER RESEARCH U.K. HIS RESEARCH INTO ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE FOR PATIENTS IN THE U.K. AND THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE FUTURE OF THE CANCER DRUGS FUND AND NICE HAS NOW TAKEN OVER THE ORGANISATION OF APPROVALS FOR THAT BUT IT IS THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY ENCOURAGING SIGN THAT WE'RE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION HOW THESE DRUGS ARE EXPENSIVE
AND THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE I'M AFRAID BUT THE PRICE WILL COME DOWN A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES ARE DEVELOPING THE SAME TYPES OF DRUGS AND AS WE SEE MORE AND MORE OF THEM COMING THROUGH INTO ROUTINE USE AND AS THEY'RE MORE WIDELY USED WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THE PRICE WILL DROP AND IN THIS AREA OF IMMUNOTHERAPY AS YOU WERE SAYING IT'S NOT JUST NECESSARILY SKINK HAS AND THERE ARE OTHER AREAS AS WELL AND ALTHOUGH WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IN SOME PATIENTS
THIS DOESN'T WORK THIS GENERAL IDEA THAT YOU CAN PERSUADE CAJOLE THE BODY
INTO DESTROYING THE CANCER IS NOW WHAT IS IT THE PRINCIPAL AREA DO YOU THINK WHERE WE'RE LOOKING OUT TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CANCER IN THE NEXT DECADE
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS BY NO MEANS ALL TYPES OF CANCER AND AT THE MOMENT THE RESULTS ARE MOST ENCOURAGING AND IN MELANOMA SKIN CANCER IN SOME TYPES OF LUNG CANCER AND IN SOME TYPES OF BOWEL CANCER AND BLADDER CANCER IT IT SEEMS TO BE THE CANCERS WHICH HAVE THE MOST MUTATIONS ARE MOST CHANGES IN THEIR D.N.A. WHICH ARE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO SEE IF WE CAN MOVE IT INTO OTHER TYPES OF CANCER AND IN SOME OF THEM THE RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN NEARLY SO ENCOURAGING AND THAT'S A BIG FOCUS OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THIS WORKS AND EXACTLY HOW WE CAN MOVE IT INTO MORE TYPES OF CANCER IN THE OTHER THING THAT IS THE GREAT DEVELOPMENT OF SUPPOSING IN CANCER TREATMENT ISN'T IT IS THIS BUSINESS OF PERSONALISING IT BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE SOMETIMES SAY THERE ISN'T A THING CALL COUNCIL THERE ARE CANCER
THAT ARE DIFFERENT AND IMPORTANTLY DIFFERENT IN EACH INDIVIDUAL YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT EVERY SINGLE CANCER IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE GENETICS OF IT AND THE CHANGES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THEIR D.N.A. AND MORE AND MORE WE'RE STARTING TO LOOK AT WHAT THOSE CHANGES ARE AND HOW THEY RELATE TO NOT ONLY HOW THE CANCER BEHAVES BUT HOW THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF PICKING UP THE DANGER SIGNALS AND RESPONDING TO THEM VERY GOOD TO TALK TO THIS MORNING PETER JOHNSON PROFESSOR PETER JOHNSON CHIEF CLINICIAN A CANCER RESEARCH U.K. BANKS
IT'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE A PROJECT IS BEING LAUNCHED TODAY THAT SCIENTISTS HOPE WILL REVEAL THE SECRETS OF THE DEEP ATLANTIC OCEAN FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THE ATLAS PROJECT WILL STUDY THE DEEP SEA EXPLORING LITTLE KNOWN ECOSYSTEMS AND MEASURING THE CHANGING OCEAN CURRENTS WHICH HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CLIMATE VICTORIA GILL REPORTS FROM THE SCOTTISH ASSOCIATION FOR MARINE SCIENCE IN OBAN
I'M JUST OUTSIDE OBAN ON THE WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND ON A CLASSIC RE PEBBLY SCOTTISH BEACH ON A NOT SO CLASSICALLY BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY AND IT'S FLAT CALM WATERS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING BUT I'M HERE AT THE SCOTTISH ASSOCIATION FOR MARINE SCIENCE MEETS SOME RESEARCHERS WHO ARE HEADING OUT IT'S A MUCH DEEPER WATERS TO ANSWER SOME VERY BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE REVIEWS AND TAKE AUCTIONEER GRAPHIC DETAIL ONLY NOT ATLANTIC ON A JETTY JUST OUTSIDE OF THIS COASTAL INSTITUTE MARINE TECHNICIAN KAREN WILSON IS FITTING THE FINS TO A TWO METRE LONG SUBMERSIBLE DEVICE THAT LOOKS A BIT LIKE A TORPEDO
GLIDERS LIKE THIS ARE AT SEA FOR MONTHS AT A TIME MEASURING OCEAN CHEMISTRY IN THE CHANGING CURRENTS THAT AFFECT OUR CLIMATE WILL PICK UP THE G.P.S. OBTAIN IT COMES THIS OFFICE I KNOW SEND ON THE DATA BACK TO SCOTLAND
THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE DEVICES BEING USED IN AN AMBITIOUS MISSION TO EXPLORE THE DEEP OCEAN THE ATLAS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER MARINE SCIENTISTS FROM TWENTY FOUR INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND IT'S LED BY A RESEARCHER BASED HERE IN SCOTLAND
MY NAME IS MARIE ROBERTS I'M A PROFESSOR OF MARINE BIOLOGY AT HERRICK WHAT UNIVERSITY IN EDINBURGH ATLASES A NEW TRANSATLANTIC ASSESSMENT OF THE DEEP WATER ECOSYSTEMS OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S THERE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THOSE ECOSYSTEMS AND HOW THEY MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE
IN PREVIOUS EXPEDITIONS PROFESSOR ROBERTS AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAVE SENT CAMERAS ON ROBOTIC SUBMARINES TO EXPLORE MOUNTAINS BUT UP TO A KILOMETRE BENEATH THE OCEAN WHERE CURRENTS HIT THESE SEAMOUNTS THEY STIR UP NUTRIENTS CREATING PRODUCTIVE AREAS THAT ARE HOME TO COLOURFUL CORALS DEEP SEA FISH AND SPIDER LIKE CRABS THIS PROJECT WILL GO EVEN DEEPER
INTO THE ATLANTIC WHERE YOU GOING AND WHAT SORT OF GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OUR BEAR
WITH THE ATLANTIC WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING BETWEEN DEPTHS OF ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED METRES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO DEPTHS OF THREE FOUR THOUSAND METRES SO MANY KILOMETRES DOWN INTO THE OCEAN
AND ARE CERTAIN PLACES IN THE ATLANTIC WHERE THEY'RE VERY RICH AND DIVERSE ECOSYSTEMS PORN BY DEEP SEA CORALS DEEP SEA SPONGES AND HYDROTHERMAL VENT SYSTEMS WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT THOSE FOR SOME TIME BUT WE'VE ONLY REALLY APPRECIATED THEIR EXTENT IN THE LAST DECADE
BY WORKING THROUGH THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE WE WILL HAVE CREATED A FAR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ECOSYSTEMS FUNCTION IN THE DEEP OCEAN
INDUSTRIES LIKE FISHING AND OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION ARE ALREADY MOVING DEEPER INTO THE ATLANTIC AND EVIDENCE OF MINERALS ON THE OCEAN FLOOR THROWS UP THE POSSIBILITY OF MINING
PROFESSOR STUART CUNNINGHAM AND MARINE RESEARCH ARE BASED HERE IN OBAN SAYS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE DEEP SEA BEFORE WE CAN MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT EXPLOITING IT THE WHAT CORAL ECOSYSTEMS IN THE ATLANTIC OUR POWER OF WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MANAGING WE HERE ON THE EARTH AND WE ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN IT AS A LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM AND UNTIL WE MAKE THE FUNDAMENTAL MEASUREMENTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE THINGS
YOU KNOW A SUSTAINED AN EVOLVING THEN WE'VE NO CHANCE OF MANAGING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES
VICTORIA GO REPORTING THE TIME HE'S TWENTY TO NINE IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR PEOPLE TO LIE IN COURT OR IN PRISON PEOPLE ACCUSED OF CRIMES PRETEND HER UNWELL PEOPLE CLAIMING INSURANCE PRETEND THAT THEY'D BEEN ENGINE WHEN THEY HAVEN'T BUT HOW CAN DOCTORS AND INDEED LAWYERS TELL WHO IS LYING AND WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH THERE'S A CONFERENCE THAT AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON WHICH IS GOING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IT'S GOING TO HEAR FROM MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION FROM PSYCHIATRISTS WHO WORK IN PRISONS WHICH PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE DEVELOPED
QUITE SOPHISTICATED TECHNIQUES TO TRY TO ASSESS LYING AND MALINGERING AND I'M JOINED BY TWO PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE AT THAT CONFERENCE DOCTOR INCOMING IS A FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST WHO'S WORKED IN BELMARSH PRISON FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AND HAD COHEN A BARRISTER FARAH'S BUILDING SPECIALISING IN CIVIL FRAUD AND DISHONESTY CASES MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING WHAT DOCTOR COMING FIRST WHILE YOU'RE YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT A CASE STUDY HAPPY TO PRESENT TO THE CONFERENCE
YES THAT IS AN INTERESTING CASE I MEAN I SAW A LOT OF VERY CHALLENGING PEOPLE BUT THE CASE I SAW SEVERAL YEARS AGO NOW CHARGED WITH MURDER
AND HE ESSENTIALLY DEVELOPED CATATONIC STATE SUCH TO THE EXTENT THAT HE HAD TO BE TAKEN OUT TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL TWICE AND HAD C.T. SCANS AND SO FORTH BUT THE PATTERN OF HIS SYMPTOMS AS VERY SUGGESTIVE FOR SOMEBODY MALINGERING IN THE END EVEN THOUGH HE WAS NOT RESPONDING TO PAIN HE WASN'T SOME DRINKING APPARENTLY NOT EATING INCONTINENT
WE STILL FELT IT WAS MALINGERING WE INFORM THE JUDGE THE JUDGE RATE A VERY STERN LETTER BACK TO HIM SAYING YOU NEED TO COME TO TRIAL
IF YOU DON'T TURN UP TO TRIAL THEN IT'S LIKELY TO GO AGAINST YOU MAY GET A LONGER SENTENCE AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES HE GOT UP AND THE NEXT DAY HE WAS IN COURT REPRESENTING HIMSELF YOU WERE RIGHT IN MY CASE WHAT CONVINCED YOU THAT YOU WERE RIGHT
WELL IT'S IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS TYPICALLY A LOT OF IT'S ABOUT EXPERIENCE IT'S THE INTERVIEW IT'S ABOUT SOMETIMES ABOUT THE TIMING OF SYMPTOMS THAT THIS WAS A CASE WHERE HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO ON TRIAL SO THE SYMPTOMS DON'T FIT A TYPICAL PATTERN AND THERE'S AGAIN FOR HIM THERE WAS AGAIN OBVIOUSLY AVOIDING JUSTICE IS THERE ALSO HOWARD COLONEL OH A WAY IN WHICH
IRRESPECTIVE IN A WAY OF THIS BIT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOUR CAN BE READ
I THINK WITH EXPERIENCE YOU CAN START TO READ THE SIGNS YOU CAN LOOK FOR INDICATORS BUT CERTAINLY IN THE WORK THAT I DO I'M LOOKING NOT ONLY AT SOMEBODY'S PRESENTATION AT TRIAL BUT ALSO AT A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE KIND OF PERSON THAT COMES OUT FROM THE PAPERWORK THAT YOU SEE THE MEDICAL RECORDS ALL THE ENGINEERING ON THE OTHER EXPERT EVIDENCE IN A CASE AND YOUR CONTRASTING THAT WITHIN ITSELF BUT ALSO CONTRASTING THAT WITH A PERSON STANDING OPPOSITE YOU AT COURT
SO IF THERE ARE FOR EXAMPLE THREE FOUR YEARS AFTER AN ACCIDENT SOMEBODY CLAIMS TO REMEMBER EACH AND EVERY DETAIL OR CONVERSELY REMEMBERS ALMOST NOTHING AT ALL THOSE WOULD BE SUGGESTIVE AH I THINK MY EXPERIENCE OF SOMEBODY WHO IS PERHAPS TRYING TO SWING THE LEAD IS IT ALSO THE CASE THAT WE ARE UNDER SURVEILLANCE TO AN EXTENT NOW
THAT WAS UNIMAGINABLE EVEN TEN YEARS AGO DID DOES THAT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT DON'T DO WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHICH IS MORE DIFFICULT TO LIVE IN CASE ABSOLUTELY AND IT FUNNY YOU MENTION SURVEILLANCE THERE ARE TWO TYPES YOU'VE GOT YOUR STANDARD C. C. T. V.
FOOTAGE ABOVE EVERY SHOP OR SOMETHING CENTRE WHICH COULD CATCH AND OFTEN DOES CATCH PEOPLE DOING THINGS THEY SAY THEY CAN'T DO OR INCREASINGLY INSURERS ARE EMPLOYING SURVEILLANCE OPERATIVES TO FOLLOW CLAIMANTS WHO THEY SUSPECT OF DISHONESTY OR FRAUD OR FORGER AND CONDUCT AND VERY REGULARLY CATCH PEOPLE DOING EXACTLY THOSE THINGS THEY SAY THEY CAN'T DO DOCTOR COMING
YES I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS ARE QUITE I MEAN PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS IT'S NOT ALWAYS AN ABSOLUTE THING PEOPLE ARE FAKING SIR SOMETIMES IT'S ABOUT EXAGGERATING THE SYMPTOMS OR THE DURATION PHYSICAL HEALTH THINGS OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE CLASSIC CASE OF SOMEBODY THAT'S GOT A BAD BACK AND THEN YOU'VE GOT C.C.T.V. BUT WITH MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS OFTEN IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE SO MUCH OF IT YOURSELF REPORTED AND REALLY SOMETIMES YOU CAN ONLY TELL BY
GETTING THE PERSON TO HOSPITAL WHEN YOU CAN OBSERVE THEM OVER A PERIOD OF TIME COS IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO KEEP SYMPTOMS ARE AND HOW KIND I MEAN THE FACT OF THIS CONFERENCE SUGGESTS THAT IT IS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY BY PRACTITIONERS AND IT IS VIEWED AS A AS A PROBLEM IN COURTS IS IT SOMETHING THAT JUDGES ARE GETTING STRICTER ABOUT IS IT BECAUSE IT POPPING AGAINST WASTES A LOT OF PEOPLE'S TIME IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM AND RECENT FIGURES FROM THE A.B.I. SUGGEST
THAT'S THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FRAUDS ARE BEING DETECTED DAILY AT A COST OF THREE POINT SIX MILLION POUNDS EVERY DAY IN A WAY THAT IT WAS NEVER PREVIOUSLY THE CASE AND IT IS RIGHT TO SAY I THINK THAT THE COURTS ARE CLAMPING DOWN TAKING A MUCH FIRMER THAN PERHAPS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE A FEW YEARS AGO HE GOT ENOUGH HELP IN DOING ALL OF THIS DOCTOR COMING IS THIS AREA OF MEDICINE STROKE LEGAL INVESTIGATION SOMETHING I CONCENTRATE ENOUGH WELL IT

NOW JOE COX WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD ACHIEVED THINGS BEFORE BECOMING AN M.P. SHOULD TRAVEL TO DESPERATE PARTS OF THE GLOBE TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE LOT OF A FELLOW HUMAN BEING SHE LOBBIED FOR THEM BACK HOME AND THAT ATTITUDE THAT IS THE ATTITUDE THAT THE LABOUR PEER LORD KINNOCK BELIEVES MADE HER SO SPECIAL HE WAS PAID TRIBUTE TO HER THIS MORNING
SHE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS A REALLY BURNING FRAME OF PROGRESS NOT BEEN ANY DEMAGOGUE IT WAY
BUT HE'S SOMEONE WHO IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS WHERE WOULD THE CONSTITUENCY LEVEL OR GLOBALLY OR IN SYRIA OR ENOUGH RIGOUR AND WASN'T CONTENT UNTIL SHE COMMITTED YOURSELF AND COULD DO ALL SEVENTEEN SHE WAS THE BEST KIND OF
COMBINATION OF HIGH INTELLECT TOTAL COMMITMENT
LET'S TALK TO MAX LAWSON WHO IS HEAD OF GLOBAL POLICY AND CAMPAIGNS AT OXFAM AND KNEW HER GOOD MORNING TO YOU MISTER LAWSON WHO MORNING KNEW HER AND AND WORKED WITH HER ON A CAMPAIGN I THINK
WE WORK TOGETHER AND MAKE THINGS SHE'S A CLOSE FRIEND SHE WAS MY BOSS FOR A WHILE AND
YEAH WE WORKED ON A TRADE CAMPAIGN AND WE WORKED ON MANY HUMANITARIAN ISSUES SHE TRAVELLED AS SHE SAID SOME OF THE MOST TOUGH PLACES ON EARTH AND WE WORKED ON SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE THE GENOCIDE IN DARFUR FOR INSTANCE YVETTE COOPER WERE SAYING TO US EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME SHE'S SEIZED LIFE AND SHE SHOOK IT UP
I THINK THAT BUT SAYS IT VERY WELL SHE HAD AN INFECTIOUS OPTIMISM THAT SHE TRULY BELIEVED
IN A BETTER WORLD ORDER A WORLD WITH WITHOUT RACISM WITHOUT HATRED
AND WITHOUT POVERTY AND SUFFERING AND INSPIRED US IN OXFAM TO REALLY FIGHT FOR THAT AND THAT AND THAT WAS INFECTIOUS I THINK SHE SHE REALLY GAVE US A REAL DESIRE TO TO COME TO WORK EVERY DAY REALLY DO THE BEST WE COULD AND WHAT WE WERE ALSO HEARING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME ESTATE SHE DID ALL OF THAT SHE HAD THAT THAT PASSION BUT ALONGSIDE IT A REAL SENSE OF HUMOUR AND FUN
OH SHE WAS GREAT WE HAD SUCH FUN TOGETHER TRAVELLING AND AND DOING THINGS TOGETHER MAKING THIS IS JUST REALLY REALLY GOOD FUN REALLY CHEEKY AND ALWAYS SAW THAT THE FUNNY SIDE OF THINGS BUT IT WAS
LOOK BEING PETER MANDELSON IN BRUSSELS OR HATE IT JUST JUST JUST AMUSING MOMENTS IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THESE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT WE WERE FIGHTING THAT JUST THE PASSION WITHIN THERE AND THAT DESIRE TO TO SEE
AN END TO THE KIND OF THE RACISM AND THE HATRED AND THE FACT THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE BETTER HE HAD TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT EXCEPTIONAL THEY'RE INSPIRING LEAVE US ALL
IT'S JUST HEARTBREAKING JUST HEARTBREAKING WHAT COULD SHE HAVE ACHIEVED DO YOU THINK IF SHE HAD
LIVED AND REMAINED IN THE COMMONS
SO MUCH SO MUCH I THINK THE TRANSITION MANY PEOPLE BEEN ASKING YOU KNOW WHY THE TRANSITION TO DOMESTIC POLITICS AND FOR ME I THINK IT WAS VERY NATURAL I THINK THE THE FIGHT FOR
BOTH INTERNATIONAL USE THINGS LIKE SYRIA THE ROLE OF THE U.K. OVERSEAS AND SHE HAD SO MUCH IMPACT ALREADY IN THE SHORT TIME SHE'D BEEN IN THE COMMONS BUT ALSO THAT THE FIGHT FOR INJUSTICE AND AGAINST POVERTY AND SUFFERING IN THE U.K. I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH SHE COULD HAVE ACHIEVED FOUND AND SO MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND IT'S SUCH A TERRIBLE SHAME SHE'S JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF
WHAT WHAT WHAT SHE COULD HAVE DONE ANOTHER LIGHT HAS TRULY GONE OUT AND IT IS JUST JUST REALLY REALLY SAD
MAX LAWSON AND THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US

WHERE TREVOR DID THE SCENE THERE NOW BEAM THERE NO SMOKE IS COMING OUT OF THE CHIMNEY UP NORMAL WHICH IT TO ANY PASSER BY WOULD EDIT BUSINESS GOING ON AS USUAL IT'S ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN COPE I SHOW YOU CARE THAT WE WERE WHERE WE ARE WHERE LYNCH WAS TAKEN PLACE FAIRLY QUIET IN TERMS OF WHAT I CAN SEE ADAM CLOGS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME NINE MINUTES
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS A SERVING M.P. HAS BEEN MURDERED WHATEVER THE MOTIVE IS IT A MOMENT TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT THE TONE AND THE CONTENT OF OUR POLITICAL CONVERSATION HOW WE TALK ABOUT
CAMPAIGNS ARE CONDUCTED ESPECIALLY AS WE COME UP TO THE BIGGEST DECISION THE COUNTRY WILL MAKE FOR YEARS THE LABOUR M.P. STEPHEN TIMMS WHO WAS STABBED TWICE AT HIS CONSTITUENCY SURGERY IN LONDON IN TWENTY TEN
SAID THAT HE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE EM PEAS ARE STILL OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE TO THERE CAN STITCH
BUT LET'S SEE OF PEOPLE IN BRITAIN AND TO GET TO SEE THEIR OWN PEE
BUMP INTO THEM IN THE STREET TO GO AND SEE THEM IN THEIR CONSTITUENCY SURGERY IS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
VALUABLE FEATURE OF HOW WE DO THINGS IN
AND I THINK ALL OF US IN PARLIAMENT WILL WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE DO
LOSE THAT OF COURSE WE ALL HAVE TO ASK YOURSELVES QUESTION
BUT WE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T THROW AWAY
REALLY VALUABLE
WHICH IS SUCH A VITAL FEATURE
ON THE PROGRAMME EARLIER TODAY THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. JESSE NORMAN SAID OR WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WHAT THIS MOMENT REPRESENTS
MAYBE IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO RETHINK THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS PARLIAMENT AND TOWARDS THE RHONE LEAMSA POLL AND SOMETHING ALL THE ONES THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS AND THAT INCLUDED OF COURSE COX WAS TO HAVE BEEN A PRETTY DEDICATED SERVICE OF THE PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF ALL THE SCANDAL AT MOSS GETS PUT UP WHEN IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A SLIGHTLY FAIRER AND MORE HONEST APPRAISAL ON ALL SIDES I THINK WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW HERE IN
AND LEAD TO WORSE NEARBY CONSTITUENCY AND BY THE TIMES COLUMNIST TIM MONTGOMERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING RACHEL REEVES YOU MADE THE DECISION THIS MORNING TO CLOSE YOUR CONSTITUENCY OFFICE WHY
WE'VE DONE THAT TODAY AND WE WILL SEEK THE ADVICE OF THE POLICE BUT WUSS
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE MOTIVATION AND AND WHAT HAPPENED EXACTLY HERE YES THEN PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO PARTICULAR BY MY STAFF IN THE CONSTITUENCY OFFICE THAT WE CLOSE THAT TEMPORARILY BUT I WOULD AGREE WITH STEPHEN TIMMS WE MUSTN'T LET THE ACTIONS OF THIS MAN
DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN M.P.S IN THE PEOPLE WHO WE WERE ELECTED TO SERVE AND SO THE WORK OF AN M.P. A SURGERY
OUR WORK IN THE COMMUNITY AT MUST CONTINUE BUT I THINK IT IS IS RIGHT TODAY AS WELL AS CEASING THE CAMPAIGNING IN THE REFERENDUM THAT WE CLOSE THE OFFICE WOULD YOU AGREE WITH JESSE NORMAN THAT IT MIGHT BE TIME TO RETHINK ATTITUDES TO TWO POLITICIANS I MEAN YOU'RE UP AT THE SHARP END
I THINK THE FACT THAT
IT'S DOING THE JOB THAT SHE LOVED IT IN THE PLACE THAT SHE LOVED IN BURSLEM BATLEY IN SPAIN
IS A REMINDER THAT THE WORK OF AN M. P. ISN'T JUST IN THE CHAMBER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND IN WESTMINSTER BUT SO MUCH OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IS IN A COMMUNITY SERVING LOCAL PEOPLE
PROBABLY WHERE WE CAN MAKE THE MOST DIRECT IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES LOT NOT PEOPLE MAYBE DON'T SEE THAT WORK OF AN M. P. BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ME AND OBVIOUSLY SO IMPORTANT TO TO JOE AND ALL OF US
AND I THINK HE MAY BE IN IN THE ROUNDABOUT WHAT M.P.S DO HAVE WHAT WE ELECT HIM TO DO AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE DO RESPECT THAT LOCAL WORK THAT M.P.S DO BUT IT'S SUCH A BIG PART
OF OUR WORK AND PERHAPS WE DO NEED A REASSESSMENT OF WHAT M.P.S DO AND WHAT WE WERE ELECTED TO DO FOR A CONSTITUENT SYMON GONE WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THIS A BUSINESS A MOMENT TO TO TO THINK BEYOND THE TERRIBLE EVENTS AND THE IMPACT PARTICULARLY ON JOE COXES AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE ABOUT A POLITICAL CONVERSATION
I WAS I THINK IT IS CERTAINLY A GOOD MOMENT TO PERHAPS RE BALANCE SOME OF THE PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARDS POLITICIANS M.P.S ARE OFTEN
PRESENTED AS COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WHEN AS RATE JEWELLERY'S HAS JUST BEEN SHARING MOST OF THEM HOLD REGULAR SURGERIES IN THEIR CONSTITUENCIES AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT COME TO THOSE SURGERIES ARE PEOPLE REALLY OUT THE ROUGHEST EDGE OF SOCIETY AND THAT GIVES EM PEAS AND UNDERSTANDING
OF LIFE IN ITS MOST RAW BETTER THAN THAN THAN MOST PEOPLE A SURVEY RECENTLY PUBLISHED IN AMERICA ACTUALLY FOUND
POLITICIANS IN BRITAIN ARE MORE LIKELY TO KEEP THEIR PROMISES THAT ALMOST ANY OTHER SET OF POLITICIANS IN THE WORLD AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PUBLIC'S THAT'S ABOUT THE PUBLIC'S ATTITUDE TO POLITICS WHAT ABOUT THAT THE TONE OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER OF COURSE WE'RE SEEING IT RIGHT NOW THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WEAR THE GLOVES HAVE HAVE REALLY BEEN OFF I MEAN
HAS IT GONE TOO FAR YOU KNOW DISMISSING ONE SIDE AS THE ELITE AND THE EXPERTS AND NOT NOT WORTH LISTENING TO
SOME OF THE RHETORIC AND SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS COULD CERTAINLY BE IMPROVED BUT I WORRIED A LITTLE BIT SOME PEOPLE HAVE RUSHED ALREADY TO BLOG AND RIGHT AND SOMEHOW BY LINKING THE TRAGEDY THAT WE SAW YESTERDAY TO THE THE REFERENDUM DEBATE
I THINK IF WE STOP TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES OF PUBLIC DISQUIET THAT DEBATE OR SHUT DOWN THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE RESULT IT'S HOW WE TALK ABOUT THEM ISN'T IT IT IS HOW WE TALK ABOUT THEM AND I THINK THERE IS AN IMPORTANCE
TO GET FACTS RIGHT AND NOT TO PERSONALISE THINGS BUT SOME OF THE WHAT'S BEING CALLED FOUR ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND IN PRINT AND ON LINE OVER THE LAST
EIGHTEEN HOURS IS ACTUALLY TO DE LEGITIMISED AND THINGS BEING TALKED ABOUT AT ALL AND I THINK THAT IS DANGEROUS THAT THE REAL REASON WHY WE HAVE SUCH ALIENATION
IN SOCIETY IS BECAUSE OF FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT POLITICS IS FAILING TO ACHIEVE ON IMMIGRATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT AND TERROR FOR EXAMPLE IT'S NOT BECAUSE CERTAIN POLITICIANS ARE ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES
ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES NEIL COIL SAID LAST NIGHT THAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE MATERIAL IT PUBLISHES AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM
LOOK THERE'S OF COURSE GOING TO BE A LIVELY DEBATE AROUND FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS LIKE OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S LINKED TO WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY I WAS AT THE VIGIL YESTERDAY AT BURST OF PARISH CHURCH FOR FOR FIT FOR JOE WHERE IN YOUR HUNDREDS OF HER CONSTITUENTS CAME TO
A TRIBUTE NOT AS A MATTER OF COURTESY BUT BECAUSE THEY THEY LOVED HER BECAUSE SHE WORKED SO HARD FOR THEM AND I THINK IF WE'RE HONEST MOST TEN P.'S
EVERY WEEK ARE DOING THAT WORK FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS BUT A LOT OF THAT GETS IGNORED AND FORGOTTEN IN THE COMMENTARY
I THINK IT MAYBE IS A TIME TIPS AT TO REASSESS WHAT THE ROLE OF AN M. P. IS YES OF COURSE IT'S THE DEBATES ABOUT THE BIG ISSUES OF OUR TIME BUT ALSO THERE WAS A ROLE THAT M.P.S HAVE SERVING THEIR CONSTITUENTS AS TIM SAYS OFTEN
THE LAST POINT OF CALL IS TO GO TO AN M. P. DESPERATE WHETHER THAT'S ON WELFARE HOUSING ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OR WHATEVER BUT WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEIR MOTIVES WERE THE GUY WHO ATTACKED HER NO YESTERDAY I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SHOULD LINK THE REFERENDUM TURBOT AND YOU'D NEVER THE LESS TO MONTGOMERY DO YOU THINK
WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE CAMPAIGN
I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A MORE MUTED DEBATE OUR PEOPLE ARE EVERYONE I'VE SPOKEN TO HIM POLITICS OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN HOURS HE'S INCREDIBLY SHOCKED AND M.P.S DO FEEL VERY VULNERABLE THEY PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK EVERY DAY TIM MONTGOMERY AND RACHEL REES THANK YOU THAT'S ALL FROM US ON THIS MORNING
B.B.C. NEWS AT NINE O'CLOCK THE GILLS HAVE BEEN HELD FOR THE LABOUR M.P.
