STEVE STEVE EVANS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS IN THAT STORY THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME IT'S A COMING UP TO THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE BEAST IS SLOWLY COMING UNDER CONTROL THAT IS THE NAME THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO THE ENORMOUS WILDFIRE THAT STILL RAGING IN ALBERTA IN CANADA I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO LAURA BICKER ON NORTH AMERICA CORRESPONDENT
NATURE OR CERTAINLY LENDING A HAND THE TEMPERATURES HERE ARE COOLER AFTER WEEKS OF SOARING TEMPERATURES IT'S NO DROPPED ABOUT TEN DEGREES WHICH ALLOWS THEM IN THE FIREFIGHTERS WORDS TO TRY TO GET A GRIP ON THIS FIRE SO WHILE THERE IS OPTIMISM
THEY'RE STILL SEEING IT WILL BURN FOR MONTHS THE WINDS ARE BLOWING THE FIRE AWAY FROM THE MOST HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS THE FIREFIGHTERS ARE STILL REPEATING ON THIRTY SIX OUR CHEFS THEY ARE STILL GREW IN DOWN IN THE GRUELLING CONDITIONS DOWN IN THE GRANGE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIRE DOESN'T SPREAD ANY FURTHER THERE WAS ONE FIGHT PHOTOS SPOKE TO IS TO DIE
HE DESCRIBED THE INSIDE OF FORT MCMURRAY AND WORKING IN THE AIR AS LIKE A WAR ZONE HE SAID BUT THERE WAS ONE TOUCHING STORY THAT HE SAID THAT YOU WENT TO OUR HOSTS
A LITTLE BOY HAD LEFT A BOTTLE OF GATORADE OUTSIDE WITH A LITTLE NOTE THAT ASKED THE FIREFIGHTER PLEASE LOOK AFTER MY HOUSE AND IT'S THESE KIND OF MESSAGES THAT KIND OF SUPPORT THAT THEY SAY HELPS THEM KEEP GOING
NOW HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO LOOK AFTER MANY HOUSES I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO REFUGEES FROM THERE ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN RE MAKE THEIR LIVES AND GO BACK TO THEIR HOMES OR IN TRUTH IS IT DESPERATE FOR THEM
WHATEVER LOCAL POLITICIANS HAS HAD A TOUR OF THE DEVASTATION TODAY AND HE SAID THAT HE FELT A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC HE SAID THAT A FIFTH OF THEIR HOMES HAVE BEEN LOST BUT CERTAINLY A LOT OF DOWNTOWN FORT MCMURRAY WAS STILL STANDING IS A LOT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS STILL STANDING BUT THEN WHEN I PUT IT TO HIM LOOK DOES THAT MEAN THAT PEOPLE CAN START THINKING ABOUT GOING HOME HE SAID
NO ASSETS WHEN WILL SOME KIND OF NORMALITY RETURNED TO FORM IT MIGHT HE SAID IT COULD BE OVER A YEAR BEFORE THINGS LOOK LIKE NORMAL AND WHEN THAT NEWS FILTERS THROUGH TO SOME OF THE EVACUEES CENTRES THAT HAVE BEEN SPENDING TIME AT TODAY THIS TWO SADE'S ONE YOU'LL HAVE PEOPLE KIND OF LOOKING THROUGH CAUSE GOING IT'S O.K. WE'RE ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A HOME WILL ALL BE O.K. AND THEN
YOU LOOK ANOTHER WOMEN WHO JUST TOTALLY BROKE DOWN AND ASIA SAID SHE'S HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR FOR HELP SHE STARTING TO THINK WHAT IS AROUND THE CORNER BECAUSE CERTAINLY THE GOVERNMENT HERE ARE WONDERING WHAT THEY DO LONG TERM THESE CENTRES FOR NO STAYING WITH FAMILY MIGHT BE O.K. FOR NOW BUT WHAT IF THESE FAMILIES CANNOT GO HOME FOR MONTHS OR EVEN A YEAR WHAT HAPPENS THEN WELL YES MANY OF THEM ARE INSURED BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL NOW HAVE TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO STAY LOWER BECA THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW AT SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND WE'RE JOINED BY VICTORIA FRITZ WITH THEIR BUSINESSES COULD MORNING VICTORIA GOOD MORNING TO YOU SARAH AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY HAS ASKED BANKS TO PREPARE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A RATE CUT SO SAYS THE SUNDAY TIMES THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE PAPER A SIGN THAT THE BANK MAY BE PREPARING FOR THE AFTERMATH
ARE THEY LEAVE VOTE OTHER REPORTS SUGGEST THAT RATES MIGHT ACTUALLY GO UP TO CAP ANY SPIKE IN INFLATION SO WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE MARKETS AND PENSIONS LET'S BE NOW TO DAVID COMING HE THE HEAD OF U.K. EQUITIES AT STANDARD LIFE INVESTMENT'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU DAVID MORNING WHAT WOULD BE THE RATIONALE FOR RATE CUT WELL I SUPPOSE IF WE LEAVE THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD OF A RECESSION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WAS THE LOSS OF ECONOMIC MOMENTUM ARE CURRENTLY SEEING ACCELERATES AND BUSINESS VESTMENTS PUT ON THE WHOLE
INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES HAVE TO INCORPORATE MEG'S LOCATIONS AND TRADE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
FOR THE U.K. SHORT MEDIUM TERM FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND ATTEMPT TO SUPPORT GROWTH AND THAT SORT OF ENVIRONMENT WOULD LOOK TO CUT RATES ALTHOUGH GIVEN RATES ALREADY VERY LOW IT MIGHT NOT HAVE A HUGE ECONOMIC IMPACT THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HAS COME UNDER HEAVY CRITICISM BY THE EUROPEAN BANKING SECTOR FOR THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE RATES AND IMPACT ON ITS BANKING MARGINS COULD BRITISH BANK BALANCE SHEETS REALLY WITHSTAND A RATE REDUCTION HERE
I THINK WE COULD I THINK GRACE MIGHT GO TO ZERO POINT TWO FIVE AT THE MOMENT ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE THE BANKS MADE WE CAN CLEARLY BE LOOK AT SWITZERLAND WERE RATES ARE ALREADY NEGATIVE BANK'S INTEREST MARGINS OF ACTUALLY GOING UP
SO THEY SEEM TO BE COPING RELATIVELY WELL LEAST IN SWITZERLAND SO I THINK YOU MIGHT SEE THE CO OPERATIVE AND CONSUMERS MIGHT MAY NOT GET ALL THE BENEFIT OF THE RICK CUTS BUT I THINK THE BANKS SHOULD COPE THE BIGGER RISK WOULD BE TO THEIR BALANCE SHEETS IF WE HAD A SLOW DOWN IN THE CORNER ME AND WOULD YOU COPE I MEAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR PENSION FUNDS LIKE YOURS AGAIN
WE'VE SEEN QUITE A LOT OF AREAS OF THE WORLD OR INTEREST RATES ARE RELATIVELY LOU OR GORDON NEGATIVES SO SOMETHING WE COULD COPE WITH THIS I THINK IT JUST CREATES FURTHER PRESSURE IN THE SEARCH FOR YIELD DIVIDENDS EXCEPTION WHICH IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON AT THE MOMENT WE'RE LIVING WITH THAT ALREADY I THINK WE'LL COOK BUT IT MIGHT PUT PRESSURE
IN TERMS OF LOOKING FOR MOVING TOWARDS EQUITIES AND OR MOVING AWAY FOR BONES AS WELL AS AN ASSET CLASS AN HOUR OVER THE WEEKEND THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE TOLD PESTON ON SUNDAY THAT HOMEOWNERS WOULD FACE A SIGNIFICANT HIT FROM LOWER HOUSE PRICES AND HIGHER MORTGAGE COS VOTERS DECIDED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE REFERENDUM IN JIM DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT DAVID
ERM YES I SUPPOSE THE SAME THING APPLIES WEAKER ECONOMY LOWER CONFIDENCE ACCEPTABLE EVENTUALLY UNDERMINE THE HOUSING MARKET AND WE'RE TALKING OF RESIDENTIAL HOUSING MARKET
PRICES ARE RELATIVELY FAIR BIT IN LONDON IT'S ALREADY STRETCH SO AGAIN IN LONDON IT COULD BE A TRIGGER FOR A PRICE FALLS IN THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET AS CONFIDENCE GETS HIDDEN PEOPLE WORRY PARTICULARLY BUT LONDON AS A FINANCIAL CENTRE OUTSIDE LONDON I THINK YOU'D BE MORE MUTED IN TERMS OF MORTGAGE COURSE A BIT MORE DIFFICULT I THINK BANKS MIGHT BE MORE RELUCTANT TO LEARN BECAUSE OF PERCEIVED RISK AND YOU MAY GET A HIGH LEVEL OF DEPOSITS TO LOANS BUT
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER INTEREST RATES COULD FALL AND THAT AND THAT MIGHT PROVIDE SOME SORT OF OFFICER BUT IT WOULD BE NEGATIVE FOR THE FOR THE HOUSING MARKET IF YOUR RESEARCH IS ACCURATE AND HOME VALUES MAY FALL DOES THAT NOT MEAN THAT THE EQUITY THAT PEOPLE OWNING THEIR HOMES ALSO SLIDES AND THAT WOULD LEAVE YOU THE THIRD OF BRITAIN THAT IS ON STANDARD VARIABLE RATES ON MORE EXPENSIVE DEAL
AGAIN THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN AND I THINK CONFIDENCE IS THE KEY AND THE KEY FACT FOR THE HOUSING MARKET AND THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY MARKET PEOPLE TAKE THEIR WORRIED A BIT COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IN LONDON SO I THINK IT WOULD BE WHO WOULD BE NEGATIVE
NOW LET'S MOVE ON COMPANIES INCLUDING CENTRICA THE OWNER OF COURSE HAD BRITISH GAS ARE RAISING MONEY FROM SHAREHOLDERS THEY SAY IT'S FOR ACQUISITIONS AND TO PAY DOWN DEBT IS THAT THE REAL REASON DO YOU THINK
I THINK PART OF IT IS TO PROP UP DIVIDENDS I THINK WE ARE SEEING AN INITIATE THERE WERE A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO PROP UP THE VILLAINS AND THEREFORE THE ISSUE I THINK THAT WAS REALLY TO KEEP THE RINGS GOING AS WELL AS AS WELL AS CUTTING DEBT IT'S NOT I THINK SOMETHING I WOULD RECOMMEND BECAUSE AN EXPENSIVE WAY
CONTAINING GIVEN AND PERIOD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CENTRICA THE STOCK PRICE DROP ACTUALLY WIPED MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS FROM ITS MARKET VALUE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE CASH THE COMPANY BROUGHT IN WHAT IS THE ENDGAME HERE
I FELT I THINK THEY BELIEVED THAT THE NEEDS TO PROTECT THEIR CREDIT RATING BECAUSE THEY WERE PAYING OUT SIGNIFICANT DIVIDENDS AND THEY'RE HAVING A TOUGHER MARKET ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE OF LOW ENERGY PRICES AND THAT HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE STORE BECAUSE WE ARE MORE PAPER
I THINK NAME GAME FOR THEM WAS TO CUT THE DEBT AND HOPEFULLY THEY CAN TRADE OUT OF THAT AS THINGS GET BETTER MEDIUM TERM I WOULD PREFER THEY WOULD HAVE CUT THE DIVIDEND RATHER MACHINE WERE PAPER BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY DECIDED TO DO DAVE A VERY QUICKLY THE TELEGRAPH IS REPORTING TODAY THAT SAUDI ARABIA IS PLANNING A THREE WAY FOREIGN LISTING FOR A RAM IT'S OIL GIANT LONDON HONG KONG OR NEW YORK AS SOON AS TWENTY SEVENTEEN OR TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE THINK ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF THE EQUITY AS WORTH ABOUT SEVENTY BILLION POUNDS DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO FIND BUYERS AT THAT KIND OF LEVEL
DEPENDING ON THE PRICE YOU ALWAYS FIND BUYERS BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE PRICE I THINK WE WILL I THINK IT'S REALLY FUNCTION FACT THEY'RE IN HERE FOR THE LONG TERM IN TERMS OF LOW OIL PRICES SO I THINK THE MARKET'S READ ACROSS WILL BE THAT THE SAUDIS ARE GOING TO STICK WITH THEIR CURRENT POLICY BUT I THINK THEY WILL FIND SOMEONE TO BUY THE SHEARS UNCLE DEFINITELY DAVID COMING FROM STANDARD LIFE INVESTMENTS THANK YOU
NOW TO TAX HAVENS ARE USEFUL ECONOMIC PURPOSE THE RESOUNDING ANSWER FROM MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED LEADING ECONOMISTS AROUND THE WORLD TODAY IS NO THEY HAVE WRITTEN TO WORLD LEADERS WARNING THAT THERE IS NO ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION FOR MAINTAINING TAX HAVENS ONE OF THE SIGNATORIES OF THAT LETTER WHICH WAS COORDINATED BY OXFAM IS THE ECONOMIST AND AUTHOR DOCTOR HOW JOON CHANG OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE NEED JOINS ME NOW FROM THERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU DOCTOR CHANG MORNING WHY DID YOU PERSONALLY SIGNED THE LETTER
WELL I SHARED THIS VIEW THAT TAXI NO USEFUL PAUPERS YOU KNOW IT IS CAXY WITH THE SPACE
ALAN'LL COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS TO FREE RIDE ON THE REST OF HUMANITY BECAUSE THAT HIS COMPANIES AND PEOPLE WHO MAKE MONEY IN ONE COUNTRY BY DOING DOES USING WAR COS EDUCATED PUBLIC MONEY USING BROADS POURS ANOTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PAID FOR BY THE TAXPAYERS OF THAT COUNTRY
AND WILL BRING THEM WHEN YOU TRY ANOTHER COUNTRY I SHOULD ACCOMPANY WHICH I DOESN'T REALLY DO BUSING STARE BUT DEFENDERS OF TAX HAVENS WOULD ARGUE THAT THEIR LOW TAX RATES PROVIDE STABILITY AND SIMPLICITY FOR EXAMPLE BY PREVENTING INVESTORS FROM MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND FROM BEING TOUCHED CHARGE DOUBLE WHEN IT COMES TO TAX IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD REFUTE WELL THAT CAN BE OF THROUGH
NEUTRAL TAX UGLY ONES BUT YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE DON'T OPEN YOUR LIES IS THAT TAX RATE DE CERTIFY IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN VERY MUCH BECAUSE LORD TAXES SO GOOD WHY DON'T ALL REACH PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE TO MY LOWER WHERE THE TOP TAX RATE IS SEVEN PERCENT
IF I DO LAW CORPORATE INCOME TAXES OR GOOD FOR BUSINESS WHY DON'T WANT COMPANY RELOCATED TO PARAGUAY TODD BUT CORPORATE TAX RATE IS ONLY TEN PERCENT DO YOU SAY EXAMPLE SURE DOES THAT PEOPLE DON'T GO TO THOSE COUNTRIES WITH
LORD CATCHPHRASE BECAUSE THEY GET THE RUBBISH SERVICE WHAT WE NEED TO FORK HOW PACKS IS A WELL USED OR NOT RATHER THAN PACKS THAT CAN BE EASILY RESOLVED BY THROUGH INTO A JOG LLEWELLYN'S DOCTOR HANG JOON CHANG THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME
THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY WHICH REGULATES THE CITY IS BEGINNING HIS SAND BOX SCHEME TODAY AND ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS COMPANIES TO TEST TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS BEFORE THEY GET REGULATORY APPROVAL AND GO ON PUBLIC RELEASE THE ACTING CHIEF OF THE REGULATOR TRACY MCDERMOTT WILL LAUNCH THE SCHEME TODAY WHO EXPLAINS WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS FOR
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY'VE GOT NEW IDEAS ABOUT WAYS TO DELIVER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS THEY CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO GO THROUGH THE FULL AUTHORISATION PROCESS TO GET YOUR PRODUCT LAUNCHED AND THEN YOU TEST IT AND ACTUALLY DISCOVER THAT CUSTOMERS DON'T REALLY WANT TO ANYWAY OR THAT ACTUALLY YOU NEED TO MAKE CHANGES TO IT SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THROUGH THERE SOME BOXES TO SAY LET'S CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU CAN DO SOME OF THAT TESTING WITHOUT HAVING TO BIG HEAD ALL OF THE UPFRONT COST
IN A WAY THAT MAKE SURE CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED BUT ACTUALLY GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE FIRM TO SAY O.K. WHEN YOU'RE TESTING THIS ACTUALLY THESE ARE THE ISSUES YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT AND SO ON LISTENING TO THAT FROM READING AS DOCTOR MARCUS ZACHARY ADDIS THE ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AT WORK BUSINESS SCHOOL WHO CAN I HOPE EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR US WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE GONNA BE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE SANDBOX WILL HIGHLIGHT DO YOU THINK
IT WAS CERTAINLY HE IT HAVE PRETEND TO BE SMALLER FIRMS TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH THE CURRENT REGULAR TORY SCHEME EACH MORNING UP THE F.C.A. AND BE ABLE TO INTERPRET THE RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE WORKING WITH THE REGULATOR YOURSELF AND THEN JUST DON'T WANNA PIES AND IN WHAT CONTEXT AND TAKEN STUNTS AND PARTICULAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY WERE TRYING TO OFFER I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR MOTIVATIONS BEHIND THERE SOME BOX ITSELF
SO ESSENTIALLY IT'S GONNA BE LURING THE COST OF ENTRY FOR INNOVATORS IS THAT THE IDEA THAT'S CORRECT ESPECIALLY FOR THEME TAKES WE TURD SMALLER TO COUNTER COMPANIES THAT WANT TO OPERATE IN THEIR PUNNETS OR SERVICES CAME OUT OF THAT SECTOR IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEM BECAUSE FUNDING IS LIMITED FOR A BIGGER COMPANY IT'S MUCH MORE EASIER TO IF WANT BECAUSE THEY HAD THE COUCH AND THEY HAD THE EXPERIENCE AND THEY CAN SUPPORT SO IT'S INEVITABLE PREDICTIONS BUT FOR SMALLER COMPANY
WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUNDING IT WILL ENCOURAGE INNOVATION ENTERED THE QUEEN INTO KIND OF MORE STABLE REGULAR TORY AREA FOR FOR INVESTORS TO COME AND INVEST IN THIS PIMP PIXEL AS WELL I THINK THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT FOR AND CUDDLE INNOVATION IN THAT SECTOR THAT PRESUMABLY IN THE SANDBOX THOUGH IS AN AWFUL LOT OF CUSTOMER DATA HOW WILL CUSTOMERS BE PROTECTED DURING THE TESTING PROCESS
THERE IS THERE IS OF COURSE A PROSTHESIS OR PICK A PROTESTANT PLACE AND THEY'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH SO IT'S NOT THAT ALL THE CUSTOMERS WE CAN GAUGE WITH THIS KIND OF MUSIC AND PUPPETS AND SO IS THIS COMING FROM I THINK IT'S RIGHT AT THE COMPANIES THAT WANT TO TRY OUT THE SANDBOX BILBY POWELL
THE CUSTOMER WILL BE OVERSEEN BY THE REGULATOR AND THE PHONE IN A VERY FIT AND VERY KIND OF CLOSE TH ENVIRONMENT IF YOU WANT AND THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF WARRANTIES ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND IN IN IN WHAT WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF
ILLEGAL IF YOU HOLLER TO THAT IT DOES NOT YOU KNOW A BITE WITH THE REGULATIONS CURRENTLY SITUATION SO THERE IS THERE A KIND OF DETAILED RULES AND REGULATIONS OF HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK AND HOW CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO BE GUARANTEED THAT THEY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE OUT ON ANYTHING DOCTOR MARCOS ZACHARY ADDIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME
THANKS VERY MUCH VICTORIA TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND GARY'S WITH US THIS MORNING HELLO GARY SERRA NICK GOOD MORNING MANCHESTER CITY'S TWO TWO DRAW WITH ARSENAL MEANS THAT CITY MAY MISS OUT ON QUALIFICATION FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IF MANCHESTER UNITED WIN THE REMAINING TWO MATCHES THEY'LL FINISH FOURTH AT CITY'S EXPENSE IS THE CITY MANAGER MANUEL PELLEGRINI

EUROPE HAS THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BROUGHT COUNTRIES WHICH HE SAYS HAVE BEEN AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS TOGETHER AND IN THAT YOU AT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS STRONGER AND BRITISH INTERESTS ARE STRONGER IF WE ARE PART OF EUROPE HELPING TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS AND HE ISSUES THIS WARNING THAT IF WE DO LEAVE INVARIABLY WE HAVE TO GET INVOLVED IN THOSE CONFLICTS ANYWAY AT A MUCH GREATER
PRICE AND HE POINTS TO ALL THE COMMONWEALTH HEADSTONES OF THE SOLOMON AND ELSEWHERE THE OTHER SIDE OF COURSE WILL SAY NO NO NATO NOT THE E.U. IS KEEPS THE PIECE ABSOLUTELY SO AND SOME LEAD I THINK THEY WILL ARGUE IT'S DEMOCRACIES WHICH KEEP PEACE THEY DO NOT GO TO WAR AGAINST EACH OTHER IT'S NOT THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT WHAT I THINK IS STRIKING ABOUT THE SNIGGERS
THIS IS NOT A SPEECH ABOUT DETAIL THIS IS A SPEECH ABOUT GUT
AND IT TELLS A STORY ABOUT I THINK THEY REMAIN CAMPAIGN THEY WANT TO APPEAL TO THOSE HUGE EMOTIVE ARGUMENTS WE SAW THE CHANCELLOR THE OTHER DAY COMING UP WITH THIS DOSSIER FULL OF ALGEBRA AND EQUATIONS BUT BASICALLY OUT OF THAT HE WANTED ONE IN YOUR FACE THOUGHT TO LEAVE AND THAT WAS
IF WE QUIT THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WILL BE PERMANENTLY POORER AND THIS IS A SIMILAR ARGUMENT IF WE LEAVE THE RISK OF WAR IS GREATER IN THOSE HUGE GUT ARGUMENTS THEY DON'T GET BOGGED DOWN IN DETAILS OF THE DEAL MISTER CAMERON DID OF THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ALL ABOUT THE TARGET TOO ISN'T IT TARGET AUDIENCE NORMAN IN THE SENSE OF
THE GREAT TORY ANXIETY OF THOSE YOU WANT TO STAY IN IS THAT ALL THE VOTERS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO VOTE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO VOTE LEAVE THAN YOUNGER PEOPLE AND MAYBE EVOKING CHURCHILL IN THE WAR MIGHT START TO ENGAGE THEM IN THAT DEBATE I THINK THAT'S TRUE AND I THINK THERE WAS ALSO A SORT OF NIGGLING FEAR THAT MAY BE THE PATRIOTIC CASE ALMOST BY DEFAULT GOES TO THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE BECAUSE IT CAN BE ARGUED IF YOU WANT TO STAY YOU'RE A BIT UNCERTAIN ABOUT BRITAIN YOU'RE LACKING
CONFIDENCE IN BRITAIN SO I THINK THEY FEEL TO SOME EXTENT THEY CAN PARTIALLY BANK THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS TO REMAIN CAMP THEY KIND OF FEEL THEY'VE THEY'VE WON THAT MUCH LESS CONFIDENT ON THE SECURITY ARGUMENTS AND THE OTHER THING THAT STRIKES ME ABOUT THIS
DOESN'T THIS SOUND JUST LIKE THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM I'M SURE THERE MUST BE A PLAYBOOK UP IN DAVID CAMERON'S ATTIC WHICH HE'S GOT OUT BECAUSE HE'S ABSOLUTELY SAME YOU MAKE THE BIG ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS YOU GET A WHOLE LOAD OF BIG
INTERNATIONAL FIGURES TO ENDORSE IT THEN YOU MAKE THE PATRIOTIC CASE COS I CAN REMEMBER MISTER CAMERON DOING EXACTLY THIS AND SCOTLAND TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'D FOUGHT AND DIED ON THE SAME BATTLEFIELDS AND IT IS EXACTLY THE SCOTTISH PLAY BOOK ONE OF THE STORIES WERE ASKING ABOUT THIS MORNING NORMAN IN THE COMMONS TODAY THEY'RE DISCUSSING THAT YOU TURN ON TAKING CHILD REFUGEES FROM EUROPE THE UTE AND THE PRIME MINISTER MADE OF COURSE STILL ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND THE MONEY THOUGH IT'S NOT OVER THIS ARGUMENT
THE U. TURN HAS BEEN HUGELY WELCOMED BY CHARITIES AND OTHERS BECAUSE THEY DO BELIEVE MISTER CAMERON HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE ON AN ISSUE OF PRINCIPLE MAINLY TO ACCEPT CHILDREN FROM EUROPE NOT TO JUST THEY WERE ONLY GOING TO TAKE THOSE FROM THE REGION BUT THE PRACTICALITIES AND THE DELIVERY REMAIN AMBIGUOUS THERE IS NO DETAIL ON THE NUMBERS THE CHARITIES ARE SAYING IT SHOULD BE THOUSANDS TODAY YVETTE COOPER AND A CLUTCH OF BISHOPS ARE WRITING TO THE PRIME MINISTER TO TRY AND GET HIM TO PLEDGED TO TAKE AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED
BY SEPTEMBER AND TAKE ALL THOSE FROM THE CALAIS CAMP AS WELL THERE'S NO DETAIL ON WHAT EXTRA CASH LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE GOING TO GET TO CATER WITH THESE CHILDREN THERE'S NO DETAIL ON WHEN THIS IS GOING TO KICK IN THERE'S NO DETAIL ON WHETHER IT WILL JUST BE SYRIAN CHILDREN ALL MIGHT INCLUDE AFGHAN CHILDREN AND OTHER CHILDREN AND WHETHER IT'S JUST GOING TO APPLY TO UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN SO THERE'S HUGE AREA OF AMBIGUITIES AND MY CAMERAS CRITICS WANT TODAY TO TRY AND NAIL HIM DOWN TO GET SOME DETAIL ON THE REFUGEE POLICY
NORMAN THANK YOU WILL BE SPEAKING TO ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT CRITICS LATER IN THE PROGRAMME YVETTE COOPER OF COURSE AND ON THE STORY OF THE PRIME MINISTER SPEAK UP HE'LL BE TALKING TO THE FOREIGN SECRETARY WHO BACKS HIM AND THE DEFENCE MINISTER WHO DOESN'T
THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN IS THERE SUCH A THING AS THE WEEKEND EFFECT ARE YOU MORE LIKELY TO DIE IF YOU ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL AT THE WEEKEND WHILE RESEARCHERS FROM OXFORD UNIVERSITY SAY THE GOVERNMENT'S PUSH FOR A SEVEN DAY N.H.S. IS BASED ON FLOOR DATA AND OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM THIS IDEA'S BEEN RAISED BEFORE THAT THE NUMBERS MIGHT NOT BE RIGHT BUT THEY'VE GOT SORT OF GOT MORE RESEARCH NOW HAVEN'T THEY YEAH WELL THAT'S RIGHT WITH THERE'S BEEN QUITE A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE WAY
THE DATA HAS BEEN ANALYSED AND INTERPRETED SUGGESTING A WEEKEND AFFECT A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T A NECESSARY HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT'S BEEN PRESENTED IN THE PAST BUT THIS STUDY GOES FURTHER BECAUSE IT REALLY
CRITICISE ISN'T ATTACKS THE HOSPITAL DATA
THAT RECORDS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH WITH PATIENTS AND THAT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR ALL THESE ANALYSES AND CONCLUDE THAT DATA IS INACCURATE AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THE THESE RESEARCHERS IN OXFORD HAVE LOOKED HURT PATIENTS ADMITTED FOUR STROKE
OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS THEY WERE RECORDED AS BEING ADMITTED FOR STROKE BUT WHEN THE RESEARCHERS ACTUALLY FOLLOWED UP WITH THE PATIENTS THEY FOUND THAT IN MORE THAN A THIRD OF CASES THOSE HOSPITAL RECORDS WERE INACCURATE A LOT OF THEM WERE IN FOR LOW RISK PROCEDURE ISN'T OPERATIONS CRUCIALLY ON A MONDAY TO FRIDAY NOW THESE TYPES OF PATIENTS CLEARLY WOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER MORTALITY RATE
THAN WOULD BE THE CASE IF THEY'D HAD ACTUALLY HAD A STROKE SO THESE RESEARCHERS ARE SAYING NOT ONLY IS THE DATA INACCURATE IT CREATES A BIAS IT MAKES AN ILLUSORY WEEKEND EFFECT AND IF YOU TAKE OUT THIS RECORDING ERROR BUT IS NO WEEKEND EFFECT AND WHO ARE THEY BLAMING FOR THE FACT THAT THE DATA IS WRONG
THEY SAY THAT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF COATING IN THE U.K. IS HE'S POORLY MANAGED AND NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED THEY SAY THAT'S BEEN WIDELY RECOGNISED THAT THEY'VE DEMONSTRATED HOW THESE INACCURACIES ACTUALLY CREATE ILLUSORY WEEKEND EFFECT BUT THEY DO SAY
MINISTERS HAVE BEEN BADLY ADVISED THEM THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PICKED UP IT'S IT'S A GLARING ERROR THAT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PICKED UP EARLIER AND FOR THAT THEY BLAME ADVISERS THEY POINTED LEAVE DON'T BLAME JEREMY HUNT AND DAVID CAMERON THEY THEY SAY THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY'VE ACTED IN GOOD FAITH BUT THEY DO SAY THEY'VE BEEN BADLY ADVISED
IF YOU CAN SHOW THAT THERE ISN'T A WEEKEND AFFECT THAT MORE PEOPLE DON'T DIE AT WEEKENDS DOES THAT REMOVE THE ARGUMENT FOR THE SEVEN DAY N.H.S. I THINK WHAT THE FIRST THING TO SAY WOULD BE THAT AND IT FROM N.H.S. ENGLAND'S POINT OF VIEW THEY'VE RESPONDED TO THIS DAY THEY DEFENDED THE DATA THEY SAY THERE HAVE BEEN IMPROVEMENTS IN RECENT YEARS
AND THEY ALSO ARGUED IT PUT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE WEEKEND EFFECT THEY SAY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE CAN GET A PROMPT ASSESSMENT BY A CONSULTANT ACCESS TO TESTS AND TREATMENTS WHAT IT WHATEVER DAY OF THE WEEK THAT THEY FALL IN AND SO THAT IN ITSELF IS A LAUDABLE AND WORTHY OBJECTIVE THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO SEE IN THE HEALTH SERVICE AND SO IN TERMS OF THE WAY HE PLAYS FOR THE POLITICAL ROW THAT'S GOING ON
I THINK CLEARLY THIS HAS RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE JUNIOR DOCTORS DISPUTE BECAUSE PATIENT SAFETY HAS BEEN AT THE HEART OF ARGUMENTS OVER THIS SUGGESTION THAT THE WEEKEND EFFECT IS ILLUSORY WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY UNHELPFUL FURTHER FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF ITS EFFORTS TO PUT MORE JUNIOR DOCTORS INTO HOSPITALS AT WEEKENDS IN ORDER THEY SAY TO MAKE HOSPITAL SAFER PLACES
ADAM HELLO THANKS VERY MUCH AND WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO THE SENIOR SCIENTIST BEHIND THAT RESEARCH AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS DAVID CAMERON'S WARNING THAT EUROPE COULD DESCEND INTO WAR IF BRITAIN LEAVES THE DEBASED BY MANY OF THE PAPERS THE DAILY MIRROR IS SUPPORTIVE ARCING THAT ONLY A FOOL DISMISSES THE ROLE OF THE E.U. IN SUSTAINING PIECE
FOR THE DAILY EXPRESS MY CAMERON'S ARGUMENT IS WEAK AND ABSURD AS OUR ASSOCIATIONS WITH NATO THE UN IN THE U.S. THEY ARGUE AT THE REAL KEY TO BRITAIN'S SECURITY THE DAILY MAIL GOES FURTHER WITH ACCUSATIONS OF WILD SCAREMONGERING THAT SMACKS OF DESPERATION DESCRIBING THE PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVENTION AS THE EXTRAORDINARY ESCALATION OF PROJECT FEAR HE CALLS ON HIM TO TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC AND STOP TREATING THE ELECTORATE
LIKE ADULTS SEVERAL PAPERS VOICE THEIR DISPLEASURE AT SUPPORT FOR THE B. B. C. EXPRESSED LAST NIGHT AT THE BAFTA AWARDS FOR THEIR SON IT WAS GALLING TO WATCH WELL FED LOVEY HE'S MAKING THE CASE FOR LEAVING THE CORPORATION ALONE AND EVEN MORE CONCERNING THAT SENSIBLE PLANS TO REIN IN THE B. B. C. BY THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WAITING GIRL COULD BE BLOCKED THE TELEGRAPH ACCUSERS B.B.C. MANAGERS OF PAYING LIP SERVICE TO THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY IN FAIRNESS AND SAYS THEY SEEM RELUCTANT TO MAKE THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS TO ACHIEVE EITHER
THE IS THE CORPORATION CAN DO THE TELEGRAPH ARGUES HIS SHOW SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMERCIAL PRESSURES FACED BY THOSE UNABLE TO RELY ON AN INCOME NOT FAR SHORT OF FOUR BILLION POUNDS A YEAR THE GREEK CULTURE MINISTER TOLD THE GUARDIAN THAT HIS COUNTRY COULD TURN TO THE U.N. IN ITS EFFORTS TO REPATRIATE THE PARTHENON MARBLES THE ANTIQUITIES ALSO KNOWN AS COURSE OF THE ELGIN MARBLES ARE CURRENTLY ON DISPLAY
AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM THE MINISTER SAYS HIS GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ABANDON THE IDEA OF BRINGING A COURT CASE AGAINST THE U.K. IF IT CAN FIND STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE CASE THE GUARDIAN THINKS THE WORLD'S LONGEST RUNNING CULTURAL ROW NOW LOOK SET TO INTENSIFY AS ACTIVISTS IT SAYS ARE COUNTING DOWN TO NEXT MONTH'S TWO HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF M.P.S VOTING TO BUY THE COLLECTION FROM LORD ELKE
CLAIMS BY FRIEND OF IAN BRADY WHO SAYS THE MOORS MURDERER TOLD HIM WEAR ONE OF HIS VICTIMS IS BURIED A FEATURED IN THE DAILY MIRROR DOCTOR ALAN KEIGHLEY CLAIMS HE PASSED THE INFORMATION ON TO THE POLICE BUT SAYS HE BELIEVES KEITH BENNETT'S BODY HAS STILL NOT BEEN FOUND BECAUSE DETECTIVES HAVEN'T TRUSTED BRADY THE SUN SAYS NEWLY REVEALED LETTERS BY BRITAIN'S LONGEST SERVING INMATE SHOW HIS HATRED OF HUMANITY STILL BURNS DEEP AS HE WRITES OF HIS SINCERE HOPE THE BRITAIN SUFFERS ANOTHER TERRORIST ATTACK THE BIGGER THE BETTER
A NUMBER OF PAPERS REPORT PLANS BY NATIONWIDE BUILDING SOCIETY TO RAISE THE MAXIMUM AGE LIMIT FOR MORTGAGES TO EIGHTY FIVE THE TELLY TERROR GRAF SAYS THE MOVE FOLLOWS A SIMILAR DECISION BY HALIFAX LAST WEEK AND IS EXPECTED TO START ANOTHER SURGE IN HOUSE PRICES
BROKERS HAVE TOLD THE HAVE T. THE DECISION MARKS A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT BY TWO OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST LENDERS AS THEY LOOK FOR EYE CATCHING INITIATIVES TELL REPLACING EXPECTED DECLINE IN BUY TO LETS SALES BUT THEY GO ON TO WARN ITS IMPACT WILL BE LIMITED AS POTENTIAL BORROWERS STILL NEED TO PASS STRICT AFFORDABILITY TESS
THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT DAVID CAMERON WILL USE A SPEECH TODAY TO SAY THAT PEACE IN EUROPE COULD BE AT RISK IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEVY NEVER MIND THOSE CLAIMS AND COUNTER CLAIMS THE GRAND SPEECHES THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER WE DO STAY IN OR LEAVE THE E.U. WILL DEPEND IN THE END ON WHICH SIDE GETS THEIR SUPPORTERS OUT TO VOTE ON FRIDAY'S PROGRAMME NIGEL FARRAJ TOLD US HOW IMPORTANT HE THOUGHT UKIP'S ROLE WAS IN GETTING OUT THE VOTE IN LABOUR'S NORTHERN HEARTLANDS
IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND NOW IN THE BIG CITIES IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND UKIP IS NOW THE OPPOSITION TO LABOUR AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IN THIS REFERENDUM UKIP HAVE GOT A VERY BIG JOB TO PLAY IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND TO GET THOSE VOTERS TO TURN OUT AND VOTE FOR REX
ONE OF THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE IS DAN JARVIS LABOUR M.P. FOR BARNSLEY THE FORMER ARMY OFFICER HAS A FIGHT ON HIS HANDS AS HE REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MOST EURO SCEPTIC AREAS IN THE COUNTRY ORRIBLE TO SEE MY CADET YOU HAVE BEEN TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE TO SEE HOW HE'S GETTING ON WE'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE VOTERS TO JOIN HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE
OR CLEAR CUT VIEWS WELL I'M UNDER UNDECIDED I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO I'M BEING HONEST
I'M LEANING TOUR COMING OUT OF IT TO BE A NEST GLAM COME IN I WANT TO COME OUT I DON'T DO WE WILL LIKE THAT THAT'S WHERE
TWELVE POINT FOUR ONE IN THE STORES WITH FORFAR TEN TONIGHT THREE FOR FIVE ON THE ACTOR ASKED THE PEOPLE OF THIS MARKET TOWN ABOUT THE E.U. REFERENDUM AND THEY'VE ALL GOT SOMETHING TO SAY AND RUBY IS LEANING TOWARDS VOTING TO LEAVE HER LOCAL M.P. DAN JARVIS STEPS IN TO PERSUADE HER
THERE ARE A QUARTER OF A MILLION JOBS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO OUR ABILITY TO EXPORT GOODS PRODUCTS TO THE EUROPEAN UNION IF WE COME OUT THE QUARTER MILLION JOBS JUST IN YORKSHIRE
WILL BE AT RISK SO I THOUGHT WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT NO PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING FOR JOBS VISITORS INTO THEY ARE YOU CONVINCING ME IT'S JUST EVERYBODY OUR SPORT MATURE THERE SAID ALL WE WANT TO BE
A RECENT YOUGOV POLL SUGGEST THIS TOWN IS THE ELEVENTH MOST YOU'RE A SCEPTIC AREA IN THE COUNTRY EVEN THOUGH SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A NEW FRIEND OTHERS AREN'T AS RECEPTIVE TO THE POLITICIAN LIKE ME
HE WANTS OUT BECAUSE HE'S WORRIED ABOUT TURKEY BECOMING A MEMBER
HOW WE CAN INTEGRATE A POPULATION THE SIZE OF TURKEY WHICH DWARFS BRITAIN PREDOMINATELY MUSLIM
IS YOUR PROBLEM WITH MUSLIMS I'M NOT THE PROBLEM MUSLIMS I'M JUST SAYING THAT I CAN SEE THERE'S GOING TO BE A FAULT BETWEEN
WHAT WAS PREDOMINANTLY KRISTIAN COMMUNITIES AND A MASSIVE COMMUNITY LIKE TURKEY WITH ITS BRITISH MUSLIMS
I'VE GOT YOUR LOCAL M.P. OVERHEAD AND DOWN O.K. I DON'T WANT TO DO
TWENTY ELEVEN THERE WAS A BY ELECTION IN BARNSLEY CENTRAL TRIGGERED BY THE FORMER M.P. BEING JAILED FOR FIDDLING HIS EXPENSES THE SAFE LABOUR SEAT WAS WON BY DAN JARVIS BUT YOU KEPT CAME SECOND PUSHING THE LIB DEMS INTO SIXTH POSITION
THOSE RESULTS WERE MIRRORED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ZE GENERAL ELECTION POSSIBLY AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE HAIR SO HOW WILL DAN JARVIS BE CAMPAIGNING OVER THEN
I'M GOING TO BE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE ON THE DOORSTEP DO YOU THINK THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO HERE WHO WANT TO LEAVE
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO LISTEN TO YOU I DON'T TAKE THAT PERSON
I'M NOT I SUSPECT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO'VE MADE THEIR MIND UP THE REALITY IS AS WE'VE EXPERIENCED TODAY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT YET MADE THEIR MIND UP WHO ARE UNDECIDED AND IT'S THOSE PEOPLE THAT I NEED TO BE TALKING TO
I'M GOING TO COME OUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE I WANT TO TAKE IT TO THE MCDONNELL CHECK PAINTED GOING GOING ONE WAY NOT ENOUGH COMING THE OTHER WAY
IAN SAWYER WAS BORN HAIR AND SAYS HE'S NOT CHANGING HIS MIND NO MATTER WHAT DAN JARVIS SAYS DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD BE SAFE
YEAH THAT'S A DEAL YES I THINK WE'VE GOT WE WOULD HAVE MORE CONQUER ALL OF OUR PEOPLE THAT'S COMING INTO THE CONCRETE
I'M NOT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPRESS THOSE SAME CONCERNS I THINK THE MOVEMENT OF POPULATION IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT WE WILL FACE OVER THE NEXT GENERATION BUT I THINK WE ALL BETTER
PLACED TO TO FACE THAT CHALLENGE IF WE OR POT THE EUROPEAN YOU
FOR JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS THERE'S NO GETTING AWAY FROM THE E.U. REFERENDUM
AMONGST THE PUBLIC MANY HERE AREN'T THINKING ABOUT IT JUST YET THERE ARE MORE THAN EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THIS CONSTITUENCY MANY OF WHOM ARE ON LOW TO MIDDLE INCOME
JOBS AND IMMIGRATION SEEM TO BE THE KEY ISSUES WITH SOME ASKING WHAT WOULD BE MORE BENEFICIAL FINANCIALLY IN
COULD TEXTURE REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO SEVEN BRITAIN WILL NOW GIVE REFUGE TO UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN WHO'VE ALREADY MADE IT TO EUROPE THAT'S AFTER LAST WEEK'S GOVERNMENT U. TURN TODAY PARLIAMENT WILL DEBATE HOW MANY NUMBERS SHOULD COME AND HAND COUNCILS WHO HAVE TO CARE FOR THEM CAN POSSIBLY COPE
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE TRYING TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IS COUNCILLOR HEATHER SMITH DEPUTY LEADER OF NORTHAMPTONSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL YOU'VE GOT RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHILDREN'S SERVICES AND JOINS US FROM A PETERBOROUGH STUDIO MORNING TUNE COUNCILLOR SMITH GOOD MORNING YOU BECAUSE BECAUSE NORTHAMPTONSHIRE IS ON A SORT OF JUNCTION WITH THE M. ONE YOU ALREADY GET A LOT OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN YOU POURING OUT THE BACK OF LORRIES
YES WE DO WE ARE ABOUT THE FOURTH HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY FOR NUMBERS OF CHILDREN ARRIVING AND WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ENGLAND AND WE'RE REALLY ON A CROSSROADS WITH THE A. FOURTEEN ON THE M. ONE AND WE ARE A LOGISTICS HUB SO IT TENDS TO BE FIRST STOP FOR THE LORRIES AND HAS THE THOUGHT OF HAVING MORE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN ALARM HERE IN TERMS OF YOUR ABILITY TO COPE
WE DO STRUGGLE TO COPE ALREADY WE CURRENTLY HAVE AS THAT LAST NIGHT BECAUSE NOT VERY OFTEN THE CHILDREN SEEM TO ARRIVED OVER THE WEEKEND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND WITHIN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE WE DO OUR BEST TO FIND ENOUGH ACCOMMODATION WITH FOSTER CARERS
BUT BECAUSE OF THE NUMBERS INVOLVED IT DOES MEAN THAT VERY OFTEN THEY HAVE TO GO FURTHER NORTH BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIND A BED FOR THEM IT IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE BULK ARE COMING INTO KENT AND KENT CAN'T ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE CHILDREN THEY GET THEY'VE ALREADY GOT ABOUT A THOUSAND I THINK UNDER EIGHTEEN SO THEY'RE ABSORBING ALL THE SPARE BED CAPACITY COMING NORTH FROM KENT
SO WHEN YOU GET TO NORTHAMPTONSHIRE WAY THEN AND LOOKING TO GO FURTHER NORTH AGAIN THERE'S A VERY CURIOUS SET UP IN THERE WHICH IS IF YOU HAVE TO FEEL YOU HAVE TO SEND CHILDREN ARE FURTHER NORTH AS YOU PUT IT IN ORDER TO GET ACCOMMODATION FOR THEM YOU'RE STILL IN CHARGE AT THEM SO THAT THE SOCIAL WORKER HAS TO DRIVE POTENTIALLY WHAT TENS HUNDREDS OF MILES IN ORDER TO KEEP CONTACT WITH THIS
THAT'S TRUE THE LAW IN THIS COUNTRY YEARS WHEREVER THE CHILD ARRIVES THAT AUTHORITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM SO THAT A HUGE WASTE OF RESOURCE WELL I WAS HOPING I DO GO DOWN TO LONDON LATE LAST YEAR TO HAVE A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION IN WESTMINSTER ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION BECAUSE
IT TO ME IT MAKES SENSE THAT IF WE CAN'T ACCOMMODATE WITHIN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE AND THEY DO HAVE TO GO FURTHER NORTH THAT THOSE AUTHORITIES THEN TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM
A LOT OF THESE CHILDREN I WANT TO EMPHASISE THAT A LOT OF THEM HAVE HAD THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE CIRCUMSTANCES TO ARRIVE WITH US AND WHEN THEY ARRIVE WITH US FOR FOSTER CARERS A LOT OF THEM SAY THESE ARE THE EASIEST CHILDREN TO LOOK AFTER BECAUSE THEY ARE SO GRATEFUL
THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS A LOT OF THEM WILL HAVE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM EN ROUTE BUT THEY ONCE THEY ARRIVE AND THEY GET SETTLED THEY WORK INCREDIBLY HARD AT SCHOOL THEY IF THEY'VE GOT SOME ENGLISH THEY THEN IMPROVE IT FAST OR THEY LEARNED FAST AND SOME OF THEM EVEN GO ON INTO FURTHER EDUCATION AND DO REALLY WELL IN THEIR LIVES
SO BY THE SOUNDS OF IT IF THE RESOURCES THERE YOU'RE A BELIEVER THAT BRITAIN SHOULD TAKE IN MORE NOW THE CALL AT THE MOMENT IS FOR FOUR HUNDRED TO COME FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY BY THE START OF THE SCHOOL YEAR IT'S NOT A LOT WHEN YOU MBUBE SPLIT IT UP BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENT LOCAL AUTHORITIES
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE IS A UNIQUE SITUATION THAT WE ARE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING COUNTIES IN THE COUNTRY AND BECAUSE OF THAT PRESSURE IT'S NOT ONLY FINDING BEDS FOR FUSS FROM FOSTER CARE AS IT'S ALSO PLACES IN SCHOOLS IS A BIG ISSUE FOR US BECAUSE IT ISN'T ONLY INWARD MIGRATION FROM OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVING UP FROM FURTHER SOUTH BECAUSE THERE ARE JOBS IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
AND PROPERTY PRICES ARE MUCH CHEAPER BOTH TO RENT AND TO BUY SO WE'RE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE GROWS PRESSURE ANYWAY WHICH FROM FROM US WE'RE A GROWING COUNTY AND WE ACCEPT BEING A GROWING COUNTY BUT
IF WE DO GET SOME GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR THESE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARRIVE BUT IT DOESN'T COVER ALL OF THE COSTS IT DOES MEAN WE DO NEED EXTRA SOCIAL WORKERS AT A TIME WHEN IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET SOCIAL WORKERS ANYWAY BUT COUNSELLOR

IF YOU ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL ON A SUNDAY YOU HAVE A HIGHER CHANCE OF DYING THAN IF YOU ARE ADMITTED ON A WEDNESDAY THAT'S WHAT THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT SAID WHEN HE WAS EXPLAINING WHY HE WANTED TO CHANGE THE CONTRACTS OF JUNIOR DOCTORS BUT RESEARCHERS FROM OXFORD UNIVERSITY SAY THAT IS BASED ON FLAWED DATA BY THE AUTHOR OF THE REPORT PETER ROTHWELL IS PROFESSOR OF NEUROLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY AND JOINS US AND OUR OXFORD STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH ABOUT THE WEEKEND EFFECT AS IT'S OFTEN CALLED
IF I CAN JUST GIVE YOU SOME SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE WEEKEND EFFECT AND THE WORK DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IS BASED ON ROUTINE HOSPITAL DIAGNOSTIC CODING WHICH WORKS WELL FOR SOME CONDITIONS BUT WORKS VERY BADLY IN MANY CASES FOR ACUTE HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS IN THE ELDERLY WHICH IS WHICH WHAT DRIVES THE WEEKEND EFFECT THESE ARE THE ADMISSIONS WITH THE HIGHEST MORTALITY
AND SO CRUCIALLY IF YOU WANT TO STUDY THE WEEKEND AFFECT THE THE BASIC PLATER QUALITY CHECK THAT YOU REALLY WOULD WANT TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ACCURACY OF THE CODING
IT'S THE SAME BUT WEEKENDS AND WEEKDAYS WE SHOULD EXPLAIN WHEN YOU SAY CODING YOU'RE SAYING WHAT THE HOSPITAL STAFF THAT THE SORT OF HOW THEY ACCOUNT FOR FOR DEBTS WHAT THEY PUT IT DOWN TO THE SEA AFTER THE PATIENT'S BEEN DISCHARGED USING THE MEDICAL RECORDS IF IT'S A CLERICAL JOB PEOPLE TRY AND WORK OUT WHAT THE MISSION WAS ABOUT AND WHAT WENT ON SO IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO OFTEN IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH WITH MULTIPLE DISORDERS GOING ON
WHAT YOU'D REALLY NEED TO DO TO STUDY THIS THE BASIC DUE DILIGENCE WILL BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T A DIFFERENCE IN THE CODING OF DATA BETWEEN WEEKEND WHEN WE THEY HAD MISSIONS BUT IN FACT NOBODY HAD DONE THAT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CERTAINLY HADN'T DONE THAT AND WHAT YOU FOUND WAS WHAT THEY WERE COMPARING WHAT HAPPENED AT THE WEEKENDS WITH IN THAT CURATE LI LO WEEKDAY COMPARISON
EXACTLY THAT IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE QUITE BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACCURACY OF DIAGNOSTIC CODING FOR WEEKEND ADMISSIONS FOR HIS WEEKDAY ADMISSIONS THERE ARE SEVERAL BIASES BUT THE MAIN ONE IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF ADMISSIONS DURING THE WEEK FOR ROUTINE CARE FOR PRE PLANNED REHABILITATION AFTER STROKE FOR EXAMPLE INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ARE MISS CODED SUBSEQUENTLY AS BEING ACUTE STROKES AND OF COURSE THOSE PATIENTS HAVE A LOW MORTALITY DURING THE WEEK
AND SO THAT GIVES YOU AN ARTY FACTUAL AND I'VE ANY ILLUSION OF A HIGHER MORTALITY AT THE WEEKEND BECAUSE THOSE COMING IN DURING THE WEEK WE ACTUALLY JUST MUCH HEALTHIER IN THE FIRST PLACE SOME OF THEM WERE THAT'S RIGHT BUT THERE IS SO YOU'RE SAYING WHAT HAVE YOU LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IF YOU STRIP OUT THAT IF YOU GO BACK THROUGH THE CODING TO TRY TO GET THEM TO BE FAIRLY COMPARED WE HAVE WE HAVE AND THE WEEKEND EFFECT DISAPPEARS THERE IS THAT WEEKEND AFFECTED YOU ANALYSE THE DATA IN THE WAY THAT
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH RESEARCH I HAVE BUT IT DISAPPEARS IF YOU WERE IF YOU STRIPPED THAT OUT IN FACT COMPLETELY IT COMPLETELY ACROSS CONDITIONS WE WILL PARTICULARLY A STROKE BUT ALSO AT HEART ATTACKS ACUTE BLEEDING AORTIC ANYA ISMS IT'S THE SAME PROBLEM ACROSS THE BOARD AND IN FACT IT WAS FAIRLY OBVIOUS FROM THE INITIAL RESEARCH REPORTS BECAUSE WHAT THEY SHOWED IN FACT
WAS THAT THERE WAS NO EXCESS MORTALITY IN HOSPITAL AT THE WEEKEND IT WAS ONLY WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE DAY THE PATIENT WENT IN THAT THERE APPEARED TO BE THIS EXCESS MORTALITY IN PEOPLE WHO ARE ADMITTED AT THE WEEKEND SO THEY WEREN'T DYING AT THE WEEKENDS THEY WERE DYING LATER SO IT WAS ALREADY AN ENORMOUS RED FLAG THAT THERE WAS SOME STRANGE BIAS HERE
OF COURSE THIS PLAY'S ACUTELY INTO A VERY LONG RUNNING POLITICAL ROW AS WELL BUT ONE HAS TO ASK IF YOU WERE SUDDENLY TAKEN ILL WOULDN'T YOU RATHER BE TAKEN INTO A N. A. PRESUMABLY ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL WHEN THERE ARE MORE STAFF ON DUTY WHEN THERE IS MORE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE
IN FACT IT'S REALLY NOT LIKE THAT I PROVIDE ACUTE NEUROLOGY WEEKEND COVER IN OXFORDSHIRE AND THE SERVICE WE PROVIDE IS ACTUALLY BETTER AT THE WEEKEND DURING THE WEEK ON STUCK IN CLINICS OR IN MEETINGS AND I CAN'T SEE PATIENTS OFTEN FOR SEVERAL HOURS AT THE GENIUS OF ADMITTED AT THE WEEKEND I'VE GOT MORE TIME I CAN SEE THEM IMMEDIATELY WE CAN GET BETTER INVESTIGATIONS AT THE WEEKEND THIS LES
THERE'S LESS STRESS ON THE SYSTEM SO SO PARADOXICALLY FROM A CLINICAL POINT OF VIEW WE JUST DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM FOR EMERGENCY ADMISSIONS AT THE WEEKEND AND THE DATA DON'T SUPPORTS FOR THERE BEING A PROBLEM
PROFESSOR PETER ROTHWELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN
WE'RE HERE ON THURSDAY HOW THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WAITING DEL WANTS TO CHANGE THE B. C. IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE A GREATER SAY IN HOW IT'S RUN TO GIVE SOME OF ITS LICENCE FEE TO OTHER BROADCASTERS AND TO STOP HER TRYING TO COMPETE WITH COMMERCIAL RIVALS WELL AHEAD OF HIS WHITE PAPER ACROSS PARTY GROUP APPEARS AS LAUNCHED A DRAFT BILL TO CHALLENGE SOME OF HIS PROPOSALS AND ONE OF THOSE BEHIND IT IS THE LABOUR PEER LORD ALI WHERE HE'D ALLY WHO IS AN INDEPENDENT TELEVISION PRODUCER FOUNDER OF THE GREAT
B.B.C. CAMPAIGN AND HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW OH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT HOW JOHN WAITING DEL DOES WANT TO CHANGE THE B. B. C. M. REALISTICALLY WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT
THE SECRETARY OF STATE SEEMS TO BE IDEOLOGICALLY OPPOSED TO THE NOTION OF THE B.B.C. LAST WEEK HE JOKED TO A GROUP OF CONSERVATIVE STUDENTS THAT IF WE DON'T RENEW IT THE B.B.C. CHARTER IT MAY BE THAT THE B.B.C. WILL CEASE TO EXIST
WHICH IS MAYBE OCCASIONALLY A VERY TEMPTING PROSPECT AND DURING HIS TERM AS OFFICE HE'S TRIED TO UNDERMINE THE VERY NOTION OF THE B.B.C. HE'D LIKE TO REPLACE THE LICENCE FEE
HE'D LIKE TO TOP SLICE AND GIVE SOME OF IT AWAY TO OTHER BROADCASTERS HE'D LIKE TO STOP THE B.B.C. MAKING POPULAR PROGRAMMES HE'D LIKE TO STOP THE B.B.C. SCHEDULING POPULAR PROGRAMMES AGAINST ITS COMPETITORS I.T.V. AND SKY
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT MIGHT BE ALWAYS VERY GOOD REASON I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD SUPPORT ALL THOSE THING ALTHOUGH NOT
THAT'S PRECISELY POINT HE RAN A CONSULTATION PROCESS EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE PUBLIC LOVE THE B.B.C. AND LOVE WHAT IT DOES SO IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE WON'T LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC WON'T LISTEN TO COMMON SENSE THEN WE IN PARLIAMENT HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE HIM SEE SENSE AND WE'RE SETTING OUT IN LOWER DRAFT BILL THREE TESTS FOR THE WHITE PAPER IS GOING TO PUBLISH TODAY THIS WEEK
UNDER PIN THE B.B.C.'S INDEPENDENCE TO MAKE SURE THE LICENCE FEE CONTINUES AND TO ENSURE THAT THE CORE MISSION OF THE B.B.C. TO EDUCATE INFORM AND ENTERTAIN IS AT THE CENTRE OF ANY CHARTER
NOW I AM WE DON'T HAVE JOHN WAITING DOWN HERE BUT ONE IMAGINES HE COULD SAY LOOK I AGREE WITH ALL THOSE THINGS BUT AND MY CHANGES WILL NOT AFFECT THOSE BUT THE B.B.C. CANNOT CARRY ON AS IT IS IT'S TOO BIG IT'S WHITE IT'S UNFAIR ON SOME OF ITS COMMERCIAL RIVALS THE SOME OF THE STUFF IT DOES WHICH DOESN'T IT'S QUESTIONABLE PUBLIC INTEREST HOW COULD HE SAY THAT
IF YOU WATCH THOSE BAFTA AWARDS LAST NIGHT THE B.B.C. BEST DRAMA SERIES WOLF HALL BEST ENTERTAINMENT SHOW STRICTLY COME DANCING BEST SINGLE DRAMA
BAKE OFF PORK UP IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE AWARDS THAT ROLLED OFF THE TONGUE YESTERDAY THE BEE BE SEIZING GREAT SHAPE IT'S DOING A FANTASTIC JOB WHY DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT AND I JUST BUT IF I OPEN MY SON THIS MORNING I WILL FIND IT'S GORE IT WAS GALLING TO WATCH WELL FED LOVE IS MAKING THE CASE FOR LEAVING THE CORPORATION ALONE AND EVEN MORE CONCERNING THE SENSIBLE PLANS TO REIN IT IN COULD BE BLOTT
HE IS A SECRETARY OF STATE THAT DOESN'T WANT TO DO WITH THE PUBLIC WANTS TO DO AND HE WANTS TO HELP THE COMMERCIAL BROADCASTERS AND I DON'T THINK COMMERCIAL BROADCASTERS WON'T THE HELP WILL NEED THEIR HELP IF YOU LOOK AT SKY
ON A TURNOVER OF TEN BILLION POUNDS IT MADE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF PROFIT LAST YEAR I.T.V. ON A TURNOVER OF THREE BILLION POUNDS MADE EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS LAST YEAR WHY DOES THE SECRETARY OF STATE
THINK THAT THESE BIG SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES GREAT COMPANIES GREAT MEDIA COMPANIES NEED HIS HELP IN TERMS OF SCHEDULING AND IN TERMS OF PROGRAMMING THEY SIMPLY JUST DO NOT KNOW WHAT ALI THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES AFTER SEVEN AND VICTORIA FRITZ'S HERE WITH A LESSON AND CORPORATE CULTURE THANKS NICK WITH ME IN THE STUDIO IS WIN BISCHOFF THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF LLOYDS BANKING GROUP AND NOW CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCIAL REPORTING COUNCIL NOW THIS REGULATOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING AMONG U.K. CORPORATIONS GOOD MORNING TO YOU SIR BISCHOFF GOOD MORNING HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE PREVAILING ATTITUDE BY BOARDS TOWARDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN THIS COUNTRY
I THINK THERE'S QUITE A LOT MORE TO DO ON THE OTHER HAND THEY CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE WHICH HAS BEEN IN THE EXISTENCE OF THEM TEN YEARS HE'S BEEN FOLLOWED A PRETTY RIGOUROUSLY HAVE COMPANIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM PRETTY RIGOUROUSLY I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN SAY THAT WE'VE GOT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS STILL PAYING OUT FOR MISDEMEANOURS WE'VE HAD A WOEFUL LACK OF MONITORING THEIR PERFORMANCE CRUCIAL TO UPHOLDING THOSE CODES OF GOVERNANCE AND STEWARDSHIP CERTAINLY IN THE CASE OF B.H.S. WHAT DID YOU THE REGULATOR NO ONE WHERE
THE REGULATOR IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT WORKS I'M A CODE RATHER THAN REGULATION I RATHER THAN LEGISLATION WHAT WHAT WAS INTRODUCED IT TEN YEARS AGO WAS A CODE OF BEHAVIOUR COULD HAVE CULTURE ADMITTEDLY IT WAS AND IN MANY CASES NECESSARY
IN SOME CASES IT WAS NOT UNTIL SPRING VERY BROADLY ACCEPTED IN THIS COUNTRY AS WELL AS COPIED ELSEWHERE IN JAPAN FOR EXAMPLE AS WELL AS IN EUROPE IT WORKS IN THE CORONA COMPLY OR EXPLAIN BASIS WHICH ALLOWS
COMPANIES ACTUALLY TO AIM HIGHER AND FOR A PARTICULAR REASON HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY IT ISN'T YET COMPLYING WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS BUT SO WIN DISH OF A CODE OF COURSE HE'S NOT LEGISLATION IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH YOU LACK THE REQUISITE BITE TO FILL YOUR STATED AIMS A WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN THE CASE OF B.H.S. FOR EXAMPLE
I THINK OF B.H.S. THEY IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE AN INQUIRY INTO WHAT HAPPENED THERE PARTICULAR OUT ON THAT I'M ON THE PENSION FUND I WOULDN'T WANT TO IN FACT ANTICIPATE BUT THAT'S GOING TO SAY WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE QUITE INTERESTING IS TO WHAT EXTENT DID SHAREHOLDERS ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THE SUPPOSED SHORTFALL THAT THERE HAS BEEN
OF COURSE THE OTHER ISSUE AT THE MOMENT IS EXECUTIVE PAY EXCESSIVE EXECUTIVE PAY BUBBLING UP IN YET ANOTHER SHAREHOLDER SPRING YOU SAY PERFORMANCE RELATED ELEMENTS OF PAY SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT STRETCHING AND RIGOUROUSLY APPLIED TODAY'S PAY POLICIES OF JOKER THEY'RE NOT THE SHAREHOLDERS AS YOU VERY WELL KNOW HEAVEN FECK RESPONDED TO THAT AND WHERE
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT QUITE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES HAVE HAD A VERY STRONG SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND VOTES AGAINST THE THE REMUNERATION REPORT THE REMUNERATION GIVEN TO CERTAIN I THINK IVES I TRULY EXPECT THAT SHAREHOLDERS WOULD HAVE TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS WILL INFECT MAKE THEIR VIEWS KNOWN AND THAT COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO LISTEN I THINK THIS HAS BEEN QUITE A SALUTARY LESSON FOR SOME COMPANIES OH KAY SO WHEN THE SHOP THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU
VICTORIA THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW BETWEEN ABOUT MIDDAY AND EIGHT O'CLOCK TONIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE PLANET MERCURY IT'LL BE PASSING BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE EARTH SO IT WOULD APPEAR AS A TINY BLACK DOT MOVING OVER THE FACE OF THE SUN
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS VERY OFTEN WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO TO TALK ABOUT IT DOCTOR MARWICK COOLER PUBLIC ASTRONOMER AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY GREENWICH GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOT VERY OFTEN HOW HOW TYPICALLY HOW OFTEN DOES THIS IT'S TRANSITS OF MERCURY HAPPEN ABOUT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN TONNES PER CENTURY SIR NOT THE RAREST ASTRONOMICAL EVENTS BUT THEY DON'T HAPPEN EVERY DAY SIR AND TODAY IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO SEE MERCURY AND WRITE ABOUT IT WELL IT'S MERCURY'S A TINY BACKED UP POLICY ACROSS THE FACE OF THE SUN AND YOU WILL NOT SEE IT WITH THE NAKED EYE
SO YOU NEED TO GO TO AN ORGANISED EVENTS THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM HAPPENING ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY IN THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY HAVE LISTS OF WHERE THEY'RE GOING ON WHICH LOCAL UNIVERSITY WE ALL AMATEUR ASTRONOMY SOCIETY BECAUSE WHAT CAN YOU DO THERE THAT YOU CAN'T DO AT HOME WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO SEE THIS TINY BACKED ORTIS TO MAGNIFY IT AND OF COURSE IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS TO LOOK AT THE SUN EVEN WITH THE NAKED EYE BUT WITH WITH BINOCULARS OR A TELESCOPE JUST DON'T DO IT UNLESS YOU HAVE PROFESSIONAL SOLAR FILTERS AND THAT'S WHAT THESE ORGANISED EVENTS WILL HAVE THEY'LL HAVE TELESCOPE SET UP
WITH FILTERS ON THEM SO THAT THEY CAN MAGNIFY THE SUN AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY OBSERVE IT SAFELY AND SEE THIS LITTLE BLACK TOP MOVING ACROSS THE FACE IS IS SOMEBODY LIVE STREAMING HAD EFFECTIVELY SO THAT WE COULD ALSO JUST GO ONLINE AND HAVE A LOOK ABSOLUTELY DESK IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT OUT TO ONE OF THE ORGANISED EVENTS YOU CAN YOU CAN WATCH IT ON YOUR COMPUTER NASA AND THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY LIVE STREAMING IT THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONS
AND EVEN SOME FROM SPACE SO YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CLOUDS SO IT'S A BIT OF A THRILL THAT'S MERCURY I'M SEEING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY AND WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT FOR SOMETIME BUT BEYOND THAT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM TRANSITIONS LIKE THIS YES THESE THESE TRANSITS HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY HUGELY SIGNIFICANT IN THE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES THEY ALLOWED ASTRONOMERS TO WORK OUT
THE IMMENSE SCALE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BY EXTENSION THE WHOLE UNIVERSE SO IT WAS REALLY WATCHING THINGS LIKE THIS THAT SHOWED US HOW TINY AND INSIGNIFICANT WE ARE NOW IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS REALLY THEY'VE THEY FOUND A NEW USE IN ASTRONOMY BECAUSE WE USE TRANSITS OF PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS TO ACTUALLY FIND THOSE PLANETS AND NOW WE KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH EVERY STAR IN THE SKY
HAS ITS OWN PLANETS GOING AROUND IT SO THESE ARE REALLY QUITE SIGNIFICANT PHENOMENA
SO IT WAS SO WE'LL WE LEARNT ABOUT WHAT THE SIZE OF THE EARTH OR THE DISTANCE IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN WHICH UNTIL THESE TRANSITS HAVE BEEN MEASURED PROPERLY WAS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK OUT YOU COULDN'T IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY TAKER A MEASURING TAPE AND GO BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN YOU HAVE TO USE AN EVENT LIKE THIS ARE RARE EVENT LIKE THIS TO WORK IT OUT AND OF COURSE WE NOW KNOW THAT THAT THOSE DISTANCES ARE IMMENSE REALLY PUTS IT INTO PERSPECTIVE AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU OF WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS DO YOU STILL GET A THRILL ABOUT
I THINK YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO LET THAT THE POET INSIDE YOU KIND OF INTERPRET THIS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING WHEN YOU SEE THIS TINY BLACK DOT CRAWLING ACROSS THE FACE OF THE SUN IT'S AN OBJECT THE SIZE OF AFRICA IT'S ONE HUNDRED MILLION KILOMETRES AWAY AND YOU'RE SAYING AT MOVING AT FIFTY KILOMETRES PER SECOND IT REALLY IS WATCHING THE MECHANICS OF THE HEAVENS IN MOTION AND YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO SEE THAT EVERY DAY

LISTENING TO THAT DOCTOR SANDRA DAVIES THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN LIVERPOOL MORNING TO YOU DOCTOR DAVIS ISN'T IT RIGHT THE PEOPLE DO KNOW THE DAMAGE THAT THIS CAN DO AND AS ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT PACKAGE AT EVERYBODY REALLY
WELL A MORNING I THINK IT'S TRUE THAT PEOPLE DO KNOW THAT THESE DRINKS HAVE SUGAR IN BUT WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY ASTOUNDED BY HOW MUCH SUGAR IS IN SOME OF THESE DRINKS
PARTICULARLY SOME ARE MARKETED AS HEALTH DRINKS AS WELL AND YOU KNOW IF I'M HONEST I WAS ASTOUNDED BY THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IN SOME OF THE BRANDS AND JUST GIVES AN EXAMPLE WELL FOR EXAMPLE LUKE SIDE FIVE HUNDRED MIL BOTTLE FIFTEEN AND A HALF CUBED SUGAR CUBES IN IN THAT BOTTLE SO EVERY TIME YOU'RE CONSUMING ONE OF THESE BOTTLES YOU'RE HAVING WAY OVER DOUBLE IF NOT THREE TIMES THE RECOMMENDED DAILY ALLOWANCES OF SUGARS AND IT'S NOT JUST THE PHYSICS IS IT SOMETIMES PARENTS THINK HAVE
GOING HEALTHY AS IT WERE BY CHOOSING A JUICER A FLAVOURED WATER OR SOMETHING AND THEY HAVE A LOT IN AS WELL ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW AND AGAIN THIS IS TO SHOW THAT PEOPLE WANT THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH SUGAR IS IN IN THESE DRINKS AND THAT THE
SUGAR IS HIDDEN SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT EVEN IN HEALTHIER DRINKS OR SO CALLED HEALTH YOU DRINK THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IS HIGH AND IT'S HIDDEN SUGARS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT REALLY WHY HIGHLIGHT DRINKS I MEAN CEREAL CONTAINS A LOT OF SUGAR OBVIOUSLY SWEETS DO HER CAKES AND ALL THE REST OF IT IT'S
DON'T YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON A WIDER RANGE OF TARGETS WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE FACT THAT CHILDREN ARE CONSUMING THREE TIMES MORE SUGAR THAN THE RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM DAILY AMOUNTS AND WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S HAPPENING THE BIGGEST SOURCES FROM SUGARY DRINKS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TARGETING BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THERE IS SO MUCH HIDDEN SUGAR IN THE INN IN THESE DRINKS
AND IT'S SUCH A SUCH A BIG SOURCE OF SUGAR THAT WE WANT TO TARGET LIST SO THAT WE CAN GET THAT MESSAGE OUT YES YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT THERE'S HIDDEN SUGARS IN MANY OTHER FOODS CUT WE'RE TARGETING THESE PARTICULAR DRINKS BECAUSE THEY REALLY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE CAUSING A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING AROUND DENTAL HEALTH OVERWEIGHT THAT'S WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN THAT YOU'VE TARGETED DENTAL HEALTH IN THE IMAGERY RATHER THAN TARGETING A BEAST
WELL I THINK YOU KNOW MANY PARENTS WOULD WOULD NOT WANT TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN TO HOSPITAL OR TO THE DENTIST FOR TOOTH EXTRACTIONS AND I THINK WE'VE USED THOSE THOSE IMAGES AND CAMPAIGNS COS THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT IT'S GOT MORE SHOCK THAT THEY WERE IN OTHER WORDS TO SHARE A CHILD WITHOUT TEETH
SOMEHOW HE'S NOW MUCH MORE SHOCKING TO PEOPLE THAN SHOWING HER FOR CHARLIE'S FRANKLY FAT WELL I FIT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THE THAT'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW FOUGHT FOR THE PUBLIC TO DECIDE BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THIS REFLECTIVE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE TODAY YES IT IS SHOCKING WHEN YOU SEE PICTURES OF CHILDREN WITHOUT TEETH AND WE KNOW THAT TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN WILL HAVE HAD TEETH EXTRACTED BY THE TIME THEY'RE FIVE AND THE THIRD OF FIVE YEAR OLDS WOULD HAVE WILL HAVE HAD SOME FORM OF TOOTH DECAY DOCTORS UNDER DAVIES FROM LIVERPOOL THANK YOU

EVERYONE'S HEARD OF BLETCHLEY PARK FAME FOR FAMOUS FOR ITS WARTIME CODE BREAKING NOT MANY THERE KNOW ABOUT WANTON HALL WHICH IS JUST A FEW MILES FROM IT IT WAS FROM THERE THAT SECRET MESSAGES WERE SENT TO SECRET AGENTS BEHIND ENEMY LINES AND TO MILITARY COMMANDERS AT THE FRONT TODAY THE VILLAGE OF WARDEN WILL COMMEMORATE THEIR VERY FIRST MESSAGE THAT IT RECEIVED HERE'S A CLIP OF THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE AGENT JACQUELINE NAN FROM THE NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN DOCUMENTARY SCHOOL FOR DANGER
BIGGEST UP LOOK AT THE RECORDS OF ALL UNLESS ENDEARS DON'T DO YOU WANT HAVE ANY USE TO THEM LIKE I COULD GET OPERATE OUT OF SEPARATE GOLD THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THEY WERE SO EAGER TO GET HOLD OF THAT
ONCE SO GOT ONE OF US GUESSED UP AND I THINK IN ORDER TO EXTRACT THE KIND IF THEY SUCCEEDED THEIR GAME UNTIL THEY'D ALL PREVIOUS MESSAGES
IT'S A COMPACT IN LONDON TRYING TO GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE OPERATOR WAS TO FLEE
COME OUT ORGANISED GETS DOUBLE RECEPTION COMMITTEES AND GET OH YOU HAVE TO DROP SUPPLIES FREEDOM AGENT HOW DO YOU DO
OUR CORRESPONDENT ROBERT HALL SPOKE TO GEOFFREY PIDGEON WHO WORKED AT WADHAM DURING WORLD WAR TWO ITS FUNCTION WAS TO HANDLE ALL THE OUTPUT THE COMMUNICATIONS OF THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE THE WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO GET
THE CODE BREAKING INFORMATION OUT TO GENERALS IN THE FIELD WHERE THEY COULD BE USED
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN ANYTHING OUT OTHER THAN AERIALS PRODUCE JUST DIDN'T TALK
EVERY PIGEON THERE WERE MARTIN COX'S CO FOUNDER OF SECRET WORLD WAR TWO LEARNING NETWORK AND HE'S IN A NORTHAMPTON STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND IT'S TRUE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF BLETCHLEY PARK WOULD NOT HAVE WOODEN HALL IT WAS IT WAS SORT OF PART OF BLETCHLEY WASN'T IT IT WAS AN OVERSPILL CARMEN IT WAS A SEPARATE ENTITY IN AS MUCH AS
MODERN THE WHOLE VILLAGE OF WATTON I WASN'T ALWAYS THE HEADQUARTERS WHAT THE WHOLE OF HOLLYWOOD AND WAS TAKEN OVER BY M.I.SIX SECTION EIGHT WHICH WAS M.I.SIX'S COMMUNICATION SECTIONS AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS
HANDEL THROUGH THAT ONE ONE WAS LIAISON WITH RADIO LIAISON WITH AGENTS IN THE FIELD S.A.S. AND IN THE EARLY PART OF THE WAR S.O.E. AGENTS ANOTHER SECRET SERVICE AND THE LATER IN THE WAR IT WAS AFTER D.DAY ALL THE INTELLIGENCE THE ULTRA INTELLIGENCE THAT CAME FROM THE CODEBREAKERS AT BLETCHLEY WAS DISSEMINATED FROM THERE SENT OUT TO THE ALLIED COMMANDERS LIKE MONTGOMERY AND PATTON WHO WERE TRAVELLING BY THAT TIME IN EUROPE
WITH AN MY SIX ALONGSIDE M.I.SIX WIRELESS OPERATORS RECEIVING THAT INTELLIGENCE TO TELL THEM WHAT THE GERMANS WERE UP TO O.K. SO LET HER LATTERLY IT WAS THERE THEY WERE BREAKING CODES AT BLETCHLEY AND THEN FEED IN THE INFORMATION THERE WHICH WAS THEN SENT OUT THAT'S RIGHT BUT THE MODERN PART WAS MORE OR LESS BEEN AIRBRUSHED OUT OF THE STORY NOR BLETCHLEY PARK HAS BECOME A BRAND ESPECIALLY WITH THE FILM RECENTLY
AND THERE WASN'T ROLE OF THE ROCK AND ROLL IS ALMOST THE THIRD LEG OF THAT ACTUALLY STORY WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHY I THINK IT'S HAD NOT KNOWN ABOUT I DON'T KNOW REALLY I MEAN I THINK I THINK THE CODE BREAKING HIS PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT EASILY THAT WASN'T STORY IS QUITE COMPLEX IN THERE LOTS OF THINGS WERE GOING ON THERE
AND WE FELT THERE WAS A PARALLEL STORY INASMUCH AS TODAY IS ACTUALLY THE SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST MESSAGE SENT BACK BY THE FIRST S.O.E. AGENT WHO PARACHUTED INTO FRANCE A MANGLE GEORGE BEGGARY AND SO WE'VE BEEN IT'S BEEN TWO PARALLEL COMMEMORATIONS READY AND YESTERDAY WE ACTUALLY HAD ONE OF THE SURVIVING FRENCH WIRELESS OPERATORS
THEY'RE GAY HOUSE ACTUALLY ON SKYPE TALKING TO US IN THE HALL IN MODERN SO MODERN AND HISTORIC COMMUNICATION COMBINED WE HAD ABOUT ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE WE HAD A KIND OF VILLAGE FETE ATMOSPHERE THE ES YESTERDAY WITH MARCEL TALKING TO ME A BIT ON THE BIG SCREEN TO THE WHOLE OF THE VILLAGE COULD HEAR ABOUT A SECRET AGENT IN FRANCE AND HOW HE USED HIS WIRELESS HOW EXTRAORDINARY SO THAT WAS A SORT OF A RE CREATION BUT
BUT OBVIOUSLY FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED NOW YES AND TODAY THE AMATEUR WIRELESS ASSOCIATIONS IN CHATEAU ROUX WHICH IS WHERE THAT SAFE HOUSE WAS IN ONE OF THEM WILL BE COMMUNICATING BY MORSE CODE TO COMMEMORATE THAT SEVENTY SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THAT FIRST MESSAGE SO IN TERMS OF ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE WAR EFFORT IT WAS HUGELY SIGNIFICANT ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE BEHIND THE LINES OBVIOUSLY WERE RISKING ENORMOUS
TAKING ENORMOUS RISKS BECAUSE RADIO GERMAN RADIO DETECTION EQUIPMENT COULD PICK THEM UP SO THEY HAD TO TAKE AN ALMOST OF CAUTIONS NOT TRANSMIT FOR TOO LONG ET-CETERA SO THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT A BLETCHLEY STORY THAT'S A SECRET AGENT IN THE FIELD STORY BUT IT'S ALL COMING THROUGH WASN'T AND
IT WAS A BIT OF A COMPLICATED HISTORICAL THING TO EXPLAIN BUT CERTAINLY WE'D WE HELP THE PEOPLE OF WATTON YESTERDAY I THINK WITHOUT BEING PATRONISING UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE ABOUT WHAT THEIR VILLAGE CONTRIBUTED DURING THE WAR IN A SENSE PUTTING IT BACK ON THE HISTORICAL MAP YES ABSOLUTELY WE'LL BE UNVEILED A BLUE PLAQUE BY GEOFFREY PIGEON HE WAS THERE YESTERDAY WHO YOU HEARD ON ON THE VILLAGE ON THE JUBILEE HALL
WELL MARTIN COX THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TELLING US ABOUT IT TIME NOW IS OF COURSE WAIT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY A SPEAKER AND A NEWCASTLE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON PRINCIPAL OF SAINT JOHN'S COLLEGE DURHAM UNIVERSITY THE MORNING GOOD MORNING
IN A MOVING INTERVIEW ON THE EVE OF THE INVICTUS GAMES PRINCE HARRY'S SPOKEN ABOUT HOW HIS CHILDHOOD MEMORIES OF HIS MOTHER ARE FADING AND REMAIN VERY PRECIOUS FOR HIM
FOR MANY A FADING MEMORY IS A SOURCE OF CONCERN AND FRUSTRATION WHILE FOR OTHERS TRAUMATIC MEMORIES ARE A CONTINUED SOURCE OF PAIN
NEW RESEARCH AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE AND PRINCETON USING BRAIN IMAGING TECHNIQUES SEEMS TO SHOW THAT SOME MEMORIES CAN BE INTENTIONALLY FORGOTTEN BY CHANGING THE CONTEXT IN WHICH PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEM
IT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THE CONTACT SUCH AS PLACES VISUAL IMAGES MUSICAL RELATIONSHIPS CAN HELP ORGANISING AND RETRIEVING MEMORIES
SUBJECTS IN THIS NEW STUDY WAS SHOWN RANDOM WORDS ASSOCIATED WITH IMAGES OF OUTDOOR SCENES AND THEN ASKED TO FORGET OR REMEMBER THE WORDS
BRAIN SCANS TRACKED HOW THOSE SCENES FADED IN AND OUT OF THEIR THOUGHTS AND SHOWED THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO FORGET BY FLUSHING OUT THE BRAIN ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE ASSOCIATED SCENES
IMPORTANT INDICATION OF THE STUDY IS THAT WE CAN INTENTIONALLY FORGET BY CHANGING OUR MENTOR CONTEXT
THIS GIVES HOPE TO THOSE TRAPPED BY PAINFUL MEMORIES ALL OF SUCH CHANGES DIFFERENT IN EACH INDIVIDUAL AND OF COURSE CAN TAKE CONSIDERABLE TIME NEVERTHELESS THE TRIUMPH OF THE INVICTUS GAMES DEMONSTRATES ONE WAY IN WHICH THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED
MEMORIES DO DEFINE US AS INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES SOME MEMORIES INSPIRE GOOD BUT SOME CONTINUED TO BE THE SOURCE OF BITTERNESS JEALOUSY AND HATRED
I REMEMBER TALKING WITH SOMEONE WHO'D BEEN SEVERELY HURT BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY BY THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS AFTER JUSTICE HAD BEEN ACHIEVED SHE WAS FULL OF FORGIVENESS FOR HER ABUSER
I ASKED HER HOW SHE'D GOT TO SUCH A PLACE SHE SAID IT WAS A DAILY STRUGGLE BUT IT EACH DAY AND PRAY SHE THOUGHT ABOUT THE LOVE AND FORGIVENESS OF JESUS AND IN THE LIGHT OF THAT SHE WOULD DECIDE WHAT TO REMEMBER AND WHAT TO FORGET
IF MEMORIES CAN BE INTENTIONALLY FORGOTTEN BY CHANGING THE CONTEXT IN WHICH I THINK ABOUT THEM THEN I FIND BOTH HOPE AND CHALLENGE I'M NOT AT THE MERCY OF MY MEMORIES AND HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY TO MANAGE THEM OVER COMPLEX THAT MIGHT BE
A CLASSIC LINE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO NORMAN WISDOM AMONG OTHERS AS YOU GET OLDER THREE THINGS HAPPEN THE FIRST IS YOUR MEMORY GOES AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OTHER TWO
MEMORIES INEVITABLY FADE BUT IT ALSO MAY EXERCISE SEE ABILITY TO FORGET
IN THE WORDS OF THE INVICTUS POEM I AM THE MASTER OF MY FATE I AM THE CAPTAIN OF MY SOUL
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT IS THERE ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR TAX HAVENS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED ECONOMISTS HAVE WRITTEN TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND OTHER WORLD LEADERS SAYING THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS NO THAT THEY BENEFIT A FEW RICH INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE THEY FUEL CORRUPTION AND WHILST ALL COUNTRIES LOSE OUT FROM THEIR TAX DODGING POOREST COUNTRIES ARE THE HARDEST HIT
THEY ARGUE THAT AS THE U.K. HAS SOVEREIGNTY OVER A THIRD OF THE WORLD'S TAX HAVENS THE PRIME MINISTER IS UNIQUELY PLACED TO TAKE THE LEAD AND HE COULD DO THAT AT THE ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMIT IN LONDON THIS WEEK BUT BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE SIGNATORIES OF THAT LETTER PROFESSOR JEFFREY SACHS IS DIRECTOR OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITIES EARTH INSTITUTE AND AN ADVISOR TO THE U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL BANK HIM IN
I THINK THE U.K. AND THE U.S. NEED TO TAKE THE LEAD RIGHT NOW TO END THESE TACKS AND SECRECY HADRONS THESE HAVENS ARE RELIEVED THE CREATURES OF THE MAJOR POWERS AND THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY ABUSE OF WEE SEED FROM ME
MY PAPERS THESE ARE SIMPLY CONDOR WHICH FOUR MASSIVE ILLEGALITY
CORRUPTION TAX EVASION AND MANY OTHER NEFARIOUS DEEDS THEY JUST NEED THEIR END
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THAT ACTUALLY THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY THAT IS INVESTED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES VIA HOBBS OFFSHORE HOBBS AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SERIES OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS WHO WANT TO PUT MONEY SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY DON'T TRUST THE REGIME THAT ACTUALLY AN OFFSHORE CENTRE IS THE PERFECT ROUTE TO DO THAT
WELL IT'S HER BASICALLY SHELLS THESE ARE VEHICLES FOR INVESTMENT SO THAT THERE IS NO RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INVESTORS IN THE EMPTY BECAUSE THE MONEY PASSES THROUGH SECRECY SHELLS SOLDERS NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION
AUTUMN AWAY THE MONEY IS STILL BEING INVESTED IN THE POOR COUNTRIES WHAT THESE SHALL COMPANIES WHO WERE THESE ALLOW FOR ALL OF THE
ILLICIT ACTIVITIES THAT WE SEE EXPOSED IN THE PANAMA FILES BUT HAVEN'T RULES INTRODUCED OVER RECENT DECADES TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT FOR EXAMPLE TRANSFER PRICING WHICH ENSURES THAT PROFITS ARE TAXED IN THE COUNTRY THEY ARRIVE OR THE TAX INFORMATION EXCHANGE AGREEMENT WHICH MEANS IT'S THE ARGUMENT THAT LOOK THE THIS IS PRIVATE NOT SECRET THE THE MONEY IS ICH STORE THE INFORMATION IS EXCHANGE WITH THE RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES
IN RECENT MONTHS THERE ARE SOME BEGINNING INITIATIVES LIKE THE O.E.C.D. INITIATIVES THAT ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE FIRST STEPS
TOWARDS GETTING SOME OF THESE FLAGRANT ABUSE AS UNDER CONTROL BUT AT THE U.K. AND THE U.S. HAD HAD HEADLINES ABOUT HOW A MARQUEE COMPANIES THEY NEEDED OR AVOIDED TAXES THROUGH THESE FLAGRANT WOO CALLS THESE ABUSES ARE NOT ACCIDENTS OR WILL PAUL'S THEY ARE AT THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM
THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN CREATED OVERTIME FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF VERY RICH AND POWERFUL PEOPLE YOU SAY IT'S THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM ARE YOU SAYING GOVERNMENTS ARE DELIBERATELY PUT THIS IN PLACE TO ALLOW THESE COMPANIES DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS
I THINK THERE'S NOTHING MORE DIRECT EXAMPLE OF HOW THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL REALLY CONTROL THE LEVERS OF FINANCE THAN THESE TAX HAVENS
COULD GOVERNMENTS IF THEY WANTED SHUT TAX HAVENS DOWN TOMORROW OR IS IT A CASE OF CONTINUING WITH THINGS LIKE TRANSFER PRICING RULES AND TAX INFORMATION EXCHANGE AGREEMENT
IF THE U.K. U.S. AND WITH THOSE TWO CERTAINLY AT THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A WHOLE ARE DECIDED ON THURSDAY AT THE U.K. CAMP RANCE THE NUTTERS OR KNOCKED THE PUBLIC IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED BY THIS ABUSE
THERE COULD BE A PHENOMENAL CHANGE IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME ULTIMATELY IS IT THE SECRECY THAT YOU OBJECT TO OR IS IT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE A PREFERENTIAL TAX RATES BECAUSE IS THERE IS THERE AN ARGUMENT THAT ACTUALLY COUNTRIES CONSENT WHATEVER TAX RATES THEY DO I MEAN JUST LOOK AT LONDON PERHAPS ALL U.K. COMPARED WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
THIS IS A SYSTEM OF IMPUNITY IT ALLOWS THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL AND THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD TO GET AWAY WITH EVERY ABUSE JUST BRIEFLY ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT THE GOVERNMENTS THAT WHO ARE MEETING ON THURSDAY WE'LL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
THESE GOVERNMENTS DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO MUCH BECAUSE THERE ARE POWERFUL BATTERERS WHETHER IT'S IN THE CITY OF ONE DINNER AND WALL STREET ARE FIGHTING VERY VERY HARD TO KEEP THESE LOOPHOLES ARE OPEN
BUT THE PUBLIC SEES MORE LEARN MORE EVEN WITH THE SECRECY WERE MORE TRANSPARENT WORLD SO I THINK OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE BEING PUSHED AND PUSHED HARDER AND HARDER TO CRACK DOWN ON THESE ABUSES
PROFESSOR JEFFREY SACHS THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING ME HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW IS JAMES KWARME B. WHO WHO'S A TAX LAWYER AT THE INTERNATIONAL AUTHOR STEVENSON HARWOOD GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
IS THERE ANY JUSTIFICATION ANY LONGER FOR TAX HAVENS IF THEY'RE INDEED THERE OF ALL THE MUSCLE I DON'T REALLY RECOGNISE THE LANDSCAPE THAT MY SAX DESCRIBES HOW THIS MORNING
THE TAX HAVENS AS YOU CALL THEM WE CALL THEM OFFSHORE FINANCE CENTRES ACT AS A SORT OF A MARKET PLACE FOR INTERNATIONAL FINANCE AND TRADE THEY'RE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PARTS OF WHAT WE DO IN A GLOBALISED WORLD
VERY HARD TO MOVE MONEY AROUND IN A WAY WHICH SATISFIES INVESTORS AS TO THE SECURITY OF THEIR MONEY AND OF THEE
UNDERLYING LAW AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNISE THAT MOST OF THE OFFSHORE FINANCE CENTRES PRACTICE A DERIVATION OF ENGLISH LAW AND ENGLISH LAW IS RESPECTED FOR ITS STABILITY AND CERTAINTY
AND THE JUDGES INTERPRETING AND ENFORCING THAT LAW ARE A HIGHLY RESPECTED BUT DON'T YOU EVER BIT BY HAVING THESE SISTERS BUT IT WILL HEARING ABOUT THE SHELL COMPANIES THE SECRECY AS WELL BEYOND PRIVACY YOU'RE ALLOWING ABUSES YOU'RE ALLOWING CORRUPTION EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE SAID THOSE
YOU COULD PUT YOU COULD FUNNEL MONEY VIA LONDON YOU COULD FINALLY VIA NEW YORK NEW YORK THERE ARE PLENTY OF LARGE SUCCESSFUL CAPITAL CITIES WHERE YOU COULD HAVE ALL THAT SAFETY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
I DON'T RECOGNISE THE DESCRIPTION SHELL COMPANIES THAT'S BEING USED SO MUCH AND THE WORD SECRECY IN HIDING AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT MY SAX PUTS FORWARD IT'S NOT THE WORLD THAT I RECOGNISE I MEAN I WORK WITH OFFSHORE FINANCE CENTRES EVERY DAY OF MY WORKING LIFE AND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S MUCH HARDER TO INCORPORATE A COMPANY IN JERSEY THEN IT IS IN LONDON
OR IN NEW YORK FOR THAT MATTER WHY NOT USE LONDON OR NEW YORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE INVESTORS FROM LOTS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES COMING TOGETHER SO LET'S SAY THAT WE HAVE A BRITISH COMPANY A FRENCH COMPANY GETTING TOGETHER DO AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN AFRICA AND IT'S USING CHINESE MONEY AS A BACKER
WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE LONDON AS THE FORUM FOR THAT WHY NOT BECAUSE THE CHINESE MIGHT NOT WANT YOU TO USE YOUR HOME JURISDICTIONAL FIELD AT A DISADVANTAGE O.K. USE A THIRD ONE USE FRANKFORT LOOK THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT THAT THE THE THE FINANCE CENTRE PROVIDES NEUTRAL TERRITORY FOR INVESTORS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER AND TO CHOOSE A PROPER LAW
WHICH IS NEUTRAL YOU DON'T SO YOU'RE SAYING IT'S PURELY THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE THE EXPERTISE THAT IS THERE BUT IT'S NOT SURPRISINGLY PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT SUSPICIOUS OF THAT BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE ZERO TAX AREAS OR VERY LOW TAX AREAS COMPARED WITH OTHER PLACES AND THERE HAPPENS TO ALSO BE A VERY GOOD PRIVACY LET'S PUT IT LIKE THAT IF NOT SECRECY WILL HOLD ON STOP USING THAT WORD SECRECY NONE OF THE OFFSHORE FINANCE ENTERS A SECRET
THEY HAVE ALL SIGNED UP TO THE COMMON REPORTING STANDARD AND THEY AUTOMATICALLY WILL BE EXCHANGING INFORMATION ON ULTIMATE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP WITH ALL OF THE SIGNATORIES TO THAT CONVENTION FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO LET'S PLEASE NOT USE THE WORD SECRET AGAIN IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND YET WHAT WE SAW IN THE PALOMA PAPERS WAS THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING THINGS THAT CERTAIN AND AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WHAT DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AND AUTHORITIES DID NOT KNOW ABOUT SO THAT IS WHY SECRECY IS USE THE WORD AGAIN
SECRECY IS THE WRONG WORD BUT THE THE PANAMA PAPERS HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO USED THAT JURISDICTION FOR CRIMINAL PURPOSES
YOU CAN'T JUST ARGUE FOR SHUTTING DOWN OF FINANCE CENTRES BECAUSE SOME CRIMINALS USE THEM THERE'S MORE MONEY LAUNDERING GOING ON IN NEW YORK FRANKFURT AND LONDON THAN ANY OF THE FINANCE CENTRES AND I DON'T HEAR MY SAX ARGUING FOR THOSE JURISDICTIONS TO BE SHUT DOWN AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS THE STANDARDS OF TRANSPARENCY
AND DUE DILIGENCE IN THE OFFSHORE FINANCE CENTRES EXCEEDS BY SOME DEGREE THE STANDARDS APPLIED IN THE UNITED STATES AMERICA OR UNITED KINGDOM JAMES QUARMBY THANK YOU VERY MUCH

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE NINTH OF MAY THE HEADLINES DAVID CAMERON WAS SAY THE RISK OF CONFLICT IN EUROPE WILL GROW IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U.
RESEARCHERS SAY DATA USED BY MINISTERS TO BACK THEIR CASE FOR A SEVEN DAY N. H. S. IS FLAWED AND THE B.B.C. DRAMA WOLF HALL WON TWO BAFTAS ON A NIGHT WHEN ITS DIRECTOR URGE PEOPLE TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR THE CORPORATION
THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE DAVID CAMERON IS TO MAKE ONE OF HIS MOST PASSIONATE INTERVENTIONS SO FAR IN THE EUROPEAN UNION REFERENDUM DEBATE BY WARNING THAT PEACE IN EUROPE CANNOT BE ASSURED IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE IN A SPEECH SHORTLY FOR PRIME MINISTER WILL STAKE THAT ISOLATIONISM HAS NEVER SERVED THIS COUNTRY WELL AND WHENEVER BRITAIN HAS TURNED ITS BACK ON EUROPE SOONER OR LATER IT'S COME TO REGRET IT A CISTERN POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH REPORT
IN AN ALREADY HIGHLY CHARGED REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IT IS PERHAPS THE STARKERS CLAIM SO FAR NAMELY THAT WERE BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE RISK OF INSTABILITY AND CONFLICT ON THE CONTINENT WOULD BE GREAT
THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH BRITAIN PLAYING A LEADING ROLE HAS MY CAMERA WILL SAY BROUGHT TOGETHER NATIONS WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS HE WERE ALSO CITE SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS IN BRITISH HISTORY WATERLOO TRAFALGAR THE TWO WORLD WARS AS EVIDENCE OF HOW THE U.K.'S HISTORY IS INTERTWINED WITH THAT OF EUROPE
BRITAIN HE WILL ARGUE CANNOT STAND ASIDE AND WHEN IT DOES SO THE COSTS CAN BE MUCH GREATER
THE SERRIED ROWS OF WHITE HEADSTONES IN LOVINGLY TENDED COMMONWEALTH WAR CEMETERIES HE WILL SAY STAND A SILENT TESTAMENT TO THE PRICE THIS COUNTRY HAS PAID TO HELP RESTORE PEACE AND ORDER IN EUROPE
EXIT CAMPAIGNERS HOWEVER HAVE HIT BACK DESCRIBING THE PRIME MINISTER'S COMMENTS AS DESPERATE AND INSULTING NATO DEMOCRACY AND FREE TRADE THEY SAY HAVE BEEN THE REAL FORCES FOR PEACE IN EUROPE NOT THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
BORIS JOHNSON HE'S CAMPAIGNING FOR A BRITISH EXETER'S EXPECTED TO USE HER SPEECH TODAY TO CRITICISE THE PRIME MINISTER'S Y. U. RENEGOTIATION DEAL HE'LL ARGUE THAT THE RISK WOULD BE TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN NO REAL REFORM OF THE INSTITUTION
THE DOCTORS' UNION THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WILL RESTART TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT TODAY IN AN ATTEMPT TO END THE DISPUTE THAT'S LED TO STRIKES AT HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND MINISTERS WANT TO INTRODUCE A NEW CONTRACT FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS AS PART OF THEIR DRIVE TO IMPROVE N.H.S. SERVICES ARE WEEKENDS BUT RESEARCHERS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY SAY DATA INDICATING HIGHER DEATH RATES AMONG PATIENTS ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL ON SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS IS FLAWED AS A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT REPORTS
ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S KEY ARGUMENTS BEHIND THE PUSH FOR A SEVEN DAY N.H.S. ENGLAND AND FOR A NEW CONTRACT FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS HAVE BEEN PATIENT SAFETY
THIS PAPER LOOKING AT PATIENTS IN OXFORDSHIRE CONCLUDES THAT STUDIES SUGGESTING DEATH RATES ARE HIGHER FOR THOSE ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL AT WEEKENDS A DEEPLY FLAWED IT FAR MORE THAN A THIRD RECORDED AS BEING ADMITTED FOR A STROKE WERE ACTUALLY IN FOR OTHER THINGS AND WITHOUT THIS ERROR THERE WAS NO WEEKEND EFFECT THEN H. S. ENGLAND SAYS THIS DOESN'T AFFECT THE WIDER ISSUE TO PATIENT SHOULD HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO CARE WHATEVER DAY OF THE WEEK THEY FALL ILL
PROFESSOR PETER ROTHWELL WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH TOLD US THE WEEKEND EFFECT WAS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF HOW POOR QUALITY DATA BADLY INTERPRETED IT COULD LEAD TO THE WRONG ANSWER
THERE ARE SEVERAL BIASES BUT THE MAIN ONE IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF ADMISSIONS DURING THE WEEK FOR ROUTINE CARE FOR PRE PLANNED REHABILITATION AFTER STROKE FOR EXAMPLE INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ARE MISS CODED SUBSEQUENTLY AS BEING ACUTE STROKES AND OF COURSE THOSE PATIENTS HAVE A LOW MORTALITY DURING THE WEEK AND SO THAT GIVES AN ILLUSION OF A HIGHER MORTALITY AT THE WEEKEND

RESIDENTS OF A BUCKINGHAMSHIRE VILLAGE ARE MARKING THE TOP SECRET ROLE THEIR COMMUNITY PLAY DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR WHARTON CLOSE TO THE CODE BREAKING CENTRE AT BLETCHLEY PARK PROVIDED A VITAL LINK FOR SECRET AGENTS ABROAD IT'S SEVENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE A WIRELESS HEART THERE RECEIVED ITS FIRST CODED MESSAGE FROM FRANCE A CORRESPONDENT ROBERT HALL WAS AT ONE OF THE VENTS COMMEMORATING ITS ACHIEVEMENTS
AT THE HEART OF A QUIET ENGLISH VILLAGE THE SONG WHICH ONE STIRRED RESISTANCE IN OCCUPIED FRANCE
WADHAM WAS THE SITE OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST SECRET WARTIME OPERATIONS
FIVE MILES FROM THE CODE BREAKING CENTRE AT BLETCHLEY PARK IT'S GIANT RADIO MAST
PASSED ON THE INTELLIGENCE GATHERED AT BLETCHLEY AND SCANNED FOR MESSAGES FROM SECRET AGENTS BEHIND ENEMY LINES
ON THE SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST MESSAGES BEING RECEIVED VILLAGERS PAID THIS MUSICAL TRIBUTE TO ONE OF THE FEW SURVIVING FRENCH SECRET AGENTS LISTENING VIA VIDEO LINK A PLAQUE WILL NOW PROVIDE A PERMANENT REMINDER OF THE WAY IN WHICH WHARTON DID ITS DUTY
ROBERT HALL REPORTING IT'S NOW TEN PAST EIGHT
THE PRIME MINISTER IS SPEAKING JUST ABOUT NOW ABOUT THAT ISSUE OF EUROPE NOW YOU'VE HEARD MANY WRIST SPELT OUT BY BOTH CAMPAIGNS IN THIS E.U. REFERENDUM MORTGAGES FOR EXAMPLE GOING UP VERSES THE SUGGESTION THAT IMMIGRATION WILL GO UP
BUT THE PRIME MINISTER IS GOING MUCH MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT ARGUING THAT THERE IS REALLY A RISK OR TO PEACE AND SECURITY ON THE CONTINENT IF BRITAIN CHOOSES TO LOSE HIS PRODUCED HEADLINES CLAIMING THAT BREAKS IT COULD
LEAD TO WAR IN A FEW MINUTES I'LL BE ASKING THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND TO EXPLAIN JUST HOW THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE BUT THE PRIME MINISTER BE MOTHERS JUST ON HIS FEET LET'S GO LIVE NOW JUST HEAR A LITTLE OF WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY HELP THE SIDE OF THE WALL
THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS FAR OUTWEIGH ANY DIS
OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE SINGLE
IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY OUR ECONOMY IS DOING SO WELL
WHY WE CREATED ALMOST TWO POINT FOUR MILLION JOBS IN THE LAST SIX YEARS
WHY SO MANY COMPANIES FROM OVERSEAS FROM CHINA INDIA UNITED STATES AUSTRALIA ANOTHER COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES INVEST SO MUCH
IT'S ONE OF THE FACTORS TOGETHER WITH A SUPERB WORK
THE LOW TAXES SET BY THE BRITISH
AND A CLIMATE OF ENTERPRISE WHICH MAKES BRITAIN SUCH AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO DO
THERE'S THE PRIME MINISTER MAKING THE MORE CONVENTIONAL ARGUMENT BUT HE WILL GO ON TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE RISKS TO THE CONTINENT IF WE CHOOSE TO LEAVE A FEW MINUTES AGO I DID SPEAK TO THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHIL HAMMOND AND I ASKED HIM IF LEAVING THE E.U. REALLY COULD LEAD TO WAR ON THE CONTINENT PERHAPS HE SHOULD BEGIN BY APOLOGISING TO THE PUBLIC FOR HOLDING A REFERENDUM WITH SUCH ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCES
THE POINT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER IS GOING TO BE MAKING IN THE SPEECH THAT HE'S GIVING THIS MORNING IS THAT BRITAIN IS A EUROPEAN POWER IT HAS A VITAL INTEREST IN PEACE AND STABILITY ON THIS CONTINENT AND HISTORICALLY WHENEVER WE'VE TURNED OUR BACK
ON EUROPE WHENEVER WE'VE RETREATED INTO ISOLATION WE'VE ENDED UP REGRETTING IT AND HAVING TO RE INSERT OURSELVES INTO THE EUROPEAN EQUATION BECAUSE IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR US TO BE THERE TO PROTECT OUR OWN INTERESTS YOU DO MORE THAN THAT ISN'T HE HE'S GOING FURTHER AND SAYING THAT IF WE LEAVE THE GLUE THAT HOLDS TOGETHER EUROPEAN NATIONS MAY BE DISSOLVED AND THAT MAY END IN CONFLICT OR WALK
WHAT HE'S DOING IS POINTING OUT THAT ALTHOUGH WE IN BRITAIN HAVE ENJOYED PEACE AND STABILITY FOR MANY MANY YEARS NOT ALL PARTS OF THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT HAVE BEEN THAT FORTUNATE NOT ALL PARTS HAVE THE DEEP AND LONG DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS THAT WE HAVE NOT ALL PARTS ARE AS STABLE AS WE ARE AND HE'S POINTING OUT AS WELL THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ONE OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ENSURES
PEACE STABILITY AND SECURITY IN OUR CONTINENT THEY'RE EASY ARGUING THAT AND ARE YOU OUT OF DOING THAT NOT THAT THERE'S A NECESSITY OF THIS OF COURSE NOT BUT THERE IS A CHANCE THAT US LEAVING THE E.U. PRODUCES THE CONDITIONS FOR CONFLICT A CONFLICT WHICH WE IN BRITAIN AND THEN FORCED TO INTERVENE
THE POINT THE PRIME MINISTER IS MAKING IS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION A STRONG EUROPEAN UNION IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO PEACE AND SECURITY IN OUR CONTINENT RELUCTANTLY SET FORGIVE ME YOU'RE WILLING THE HEADLINES THAT SO I'D LIKE RIGHT WALK I DIDN'T I DIDN'T YOU'RE WAITING CHURCHILL YOU'RE QUOTING WELLINGTON YOU TRICK QUOTING THE DUKE OF MALBOROUGH DEDE AND IT WHEN I SAY WILL MIGHTILY YOUNG DEAD EVERYWHERE NOT QUITE SAYING THAT I DON'T WRITE THE HEADLINES IN SOME OF OUR
NEWSPAPERS WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS IT AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STABILITY AND THE PIECE THAT WE ENJOY IN EUROPE AND THAT IS IN BRITAIN'S INTEREST AND HISTORY TELLS US THAT BRITAIN IS A EUROPEAN POWER IT'S A GLOBAL POWER AS WELL BUT IT'S A EUROPEAN AND IT CANNOT TURN ITS BACK ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN EUROPE WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN EUROPE WELL I PUT TO YOU AGAIN THEN THE QUESTION I OPENED WITH WITH THIS IF IT'S SO SERIOUS
WHY AN EARTH PUT THIS AT RISK BY HAVING AN UNNECESSARY REFERENDUM AND WHY DID YOU NOT MUCH LONGER THAN A YEAR AGO I THINK SO YOU WERE READY TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE YEAR IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IT IF THERE'D BEEN NO CHANGE IF THERE WAS NO CHANGE OF DIRECTION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOP AT A PREVIOUS DEFENCE SECRETARY YOU WERE WEARING
WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK OVER PEACE AND WAR AND YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND BECAUSE OF A FEW WELFARE BENEFIT CHANGES WHY ARE WE HAVING A REFERENDUM BECAUSE THIS IS A DEMOCRACY AND BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE WE LAST VOTED ON THIS ISSUE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND IT IS RIGHT IN A DEMOCRACY AND CLEARLY THE WILL OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE AS WE'RE SEEING FROM THIS ROBUST DEBATE TODAY THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEW
ON THIS ISSUE AND IT'S SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE IN A DEMOCRACY FOR THE ELITE TO SAY THIS IS A QUESTION TOO IMPORTANT TO PUT TO THE PEOPLE COULD IMAGINE CHURCHILL SAYING I THINK THIS COULD CAUSE CONFLICT IN EUROPE BUT NEVER MIND LET'S CONSIDER DOING IT IT'S A QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD PUT TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE WE SHOULD HAVE A ROBUST DEBATE ABOUT IT NOBODY ON THIS SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT IS SUGGESTING THAT ALL THE ALL THE ARGUMENTS GO ONE WAY THERE'S A BALANCE TO BE MADE
WE BELIEVE THAT THE BALANCE OF THESE ARGUMENTS LOOKING AT BRITAIN'S PROSPERITY FUTURE JOBS FUTURE ECONOMIC GROWTH BRITAIN'S SECURITY AND SAFETY AND BRITAIN'S INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD CLEARLY COME DOWN ON THE SIDE OF REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S STRONGER SAFER AND MORE PROSPEROUS FORGIVE ME THAT HAS YOUR EXPERIENCES FIRST DEFENCE SECRETARY AND FOREIGN SECRETARY CHANGED YOUR MIND YOU WERE A LEADING EUROSCEPTIC
ARE THERE THINGS THAT YOU'VE SEEN CONVERSATIONS YOU'VE HAD DOCUMENTS THAT'S CROSSED YOUR DESK THAT HAVE NOW MADE YOU THINK THAT THE RISK OF BRITAIN LEAVING IS FAR FAR HIGHER OR IS YOUR SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT JUST A PANIC THAT HE MIGHT LOSE BUT IT HAS BEING FOREIGN SECRETARY HAS CERTAINLY CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE I VISITED SEVENTY ONE COUNTRIES AS FOREIGN SECRETARY
AND WITH MY HAND ON MY HEART I CAN TELL YOU THAT NOT IN ANY ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE THE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN MEETING TOLD ME THAT BRITAIN WOULD BE A MORE INFLUENTIAL POWER BRITAIN WOULD BE A MORE IMPORTANT PARTNER TO THEM IF WE WERE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION QUITE THE CONTRARY ALL OF THEM HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY REGARD BRITAIN AS AN IMPORTANT POWER IN ITS OWN RIGHT BUT THEY REGARD BRITAIN'S INFLUENCE AND BRITAIN'S IMPORTANCE AS MAGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT IT IS ONE OF THE LEADING
POWERS IN THE EUROPEAN LET'S GO TO THE COLONEL OF THIS ARGUMENT BEN ABOUT PEACE AND SECURITY YOU KNOW YOUR FOUR BY YOUR PREDECESSORS DEPENDS AGREE LIAM FOX WOULD MAKE THIS CASE NO DOUBT BORIS JOHNSON WILL LATER THAT IT'S NATO THAT KEEPS THE PEACE AT THE EUROPEAN CONCERT IT IS THE BINDING OF THE UNITED STATES IN WITH THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT KEEPS IT SECURE NOT THE
OF COURSE NATO IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT AND WILL REMAIN A MEMBER OF NATO WHATEVER HAPPENS BUT NATO IS ESSENTIALLY AN OUTWARD LOOKING WAR FIGHTING MACHINE AND VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO US WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES IS OPERATE TO BIND THE NATION STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TOGETHER THROUGH MECHANISMS FOR PEACE AND SECURITY WHICH WORK BETWEEN US
EUROPEAN UNION STATE HOLDING MY JOB DO YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT IN THE FIRST TWENTY THIRTY EVEN FORTY YEARS OF THE BUT FAR FROM BINDING THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE TOGETHER AT THE MOMENT THE CRISIS OVER THE EUROZONE WITH PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF INTEREST RATES SET TO BENEFIT GERMANY THE CRISIS OVER MASS MIGRATION WHICH IS NOT BEING CONTROLLED AND PEOPLE ERECTING FENCES ACROSS BORDERS AGAIN
HE WAS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SOURCES OF CONFLICT NOT ENDING THEM NOW IT THAT'S BUT THAT'S IF YOU IF I MAY SAY SO THAT'S A MISS ANALYSIS THE CHALLENGE OF A DEALING WITH LARGE SCALE MIGRATION FLOWS IN THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE AND WE'RE NOT IN THE SHOWING AN AREA SO THAT WE'RE NOT
DIRECTLY AFFECTED AS OTHER COUNTRIES ARE BUT THAT THAT CHALLENGE WOULD BE THERE ANYWAY AND THE EUROPEAN UNION GIVES HER SOME MECHANISM FOR ADDRESSING THAT CHALLENGE NOW IT'S NOT A PERFECT MECHANISM AND OF COURSE TENSIONS HAVE RISEN AS A RESULT OF THE HUGE MIGRATORY FLOWS THAT WE SAW LAST SUMMER BUT IN EUROPEAN UNION GIVES US A MECHANISM FOR CONTAINING AND MANAGING THOSE THREATS WE CAN'T
AS AS THE BRITISH PEOPLE JUST BECAUSE WE LIVE ON AN ISLAND TURN OUR BACKS ON THOSE ISSUES AND SAY THEY'RE NOTHING TO DO WITH US WHAT AFFECT US YET THEY DO PRESENT US WITH RISK AND WE HAVE TO BE ENGAGED I WANT YOU TO SPELL OUT I ACCEPT YOU KNOW YOU SAY DON'T WRITE HEADLINES ABOUT WAR LET'S YOU SPELL OUT THE WRIST THEN IF WE LEAVE WHAT THEN FOLLOWS THAT COULD LEAD TO CONFLICT
THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL BE WEAKER WITHOUT BRITAIN INSIDE IT AND THE MECHANISMS THAT MAINTAIN THE PEACE AND STABILITY OF THE CONTINENT WILL BE COMMENSURATE LEE WE CUT IT WE SAY THE DEMOCRACIES COS USUALLY RECEIVE DEMOCRACIES DON'T GO TO WAR WITH ONE OF US ARE YOU SAYING THAT IF BRITAIN LEAVES THAT THE
THERE WOULD BE A SITUATION SUDDENLY OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS PERHAPS IN WHICH ONE COUNTRY IN THE E.U. MIGHT GO INTO CONFLICT WITH ANOTHER COUNTRY IN THE E.U. DESPITE THE FACT THESE ARE FREE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE RUN THE RISK OF HIS TENSIONS RISING IN PARTS OF EUROPE THAT PERHAPS DO NOT HAVE THE DEEP
AN ENDURING DEMOCRATIC ROOTS THAT WE AND OUR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURS HAVE AND IN THE AREAS JUST OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE BALKANS FOR EXAMPLE COUNTRIES THAT ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT OUR APPLICANT STATES MET THEM WOULD BE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE AND SIGNIFICANT ABILITY TO INFLUENCE EVENTS
ANYTHING THAT WEAKENS THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD WEAKEN THE FORCES OF STABILITY IN THOSE AREAS FIND WOULD BE BAD FOR BRITAIN BAD FOR BRITAIN'S SECURITY SURE YOU MET AND BAD FOR BRITAIN'S ROLE IN THE WORLD A FINAL THOUGHT FOR YOU
IT IS REALLY QUITE EXTRAORDINARY ISN'T IT THAT A NATIONAL LEADER WHO SAYS THAT LEAVING THE Y. YOU WOULD BE SO FUNDAMENTALLY AGAINST OUR NATIONAL INTEREST HAS CHOSEN TO PUT ALL THIS RISK SIMPLY TO DEAL WITH THE RISE OF UKIP AND A REBELLION IN HIS OWN PARTY
WE LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY THAT NICK WHEN WE GO INTO A GENERAL ELECTION AS A TORY I WILL BE TELLING MY VOTE IS THAT IT IS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST TO ELECT A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT THAT WHAT THE OPPOSITION PARTY IS PROPOSING FOR GOVERNMENT WOULD BE BAD FOR BRITAIN BUT IT IS FOR THE VOTERS TO DECIDE AND IN THIS ARGUMENT WE ARE MAKING THE CASE FOR BRITAIN BEING STRONGER
SAFER AND BETTER OFF INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR BRITISH PEOPLE THAT WILL LISTEN TO THE ARGUMENTS WEIGH THEM UP AND DECIDE ON BALANCE WHERE BRITAIN'S BEST INTEREST LICE THEY WILL AND THEY'LL ALSO LISTEN TO A JUNIOR DEFENCE MINISTER IS COMING ON THE PROGRAMME LATER WHO DISAGREES WITH THAT PHILIP HAMMOND FOREIGN SECRETARY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT
IT HAS BEEN CALLED THE BEAST THE FIRE THAT'S DEVOURED LARGE PARTS OF FORT MCMURRAY IN CANADA AND FORCE MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS TO RUN FOR THEIR LIVES EVEN WITH HAIG'S GROWING THAT THE FIRE CAN BE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL THE PEOPLE WHO FLED ARE BEGINNING TO LEARN THAT IT COULD BE MANY MANY MONTHS BEFORE THEY CAN RETURN OR CORRESPONDENT LAURA BAKER HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO SOME OF THOSE IN AN EVACUEE CENTRE A FEW HOURS SOUTH OF THE WORST AFFECTED AREA
THOUSANDS OF EVACUEES HAVE COME THROUGH THESE DOORS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS FOR HELP I SPOT A YOUNG MOTHER TO BE SERIOUS SMITH AND FADO WHICH IS BEING INDUCED IN JUST A FEW HOURS WE HAVE VIDEO FOOTAGE
THE HOUSE WE'RE SEEING A BURNING SO IT'S GONE FISHING
AND HOW YOU DO THEN
BUT I MEAN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW JOINER LIVES TOMORROW SO IT'S IT'S KIND OF USED OUR MINDS ONE OF EVERY SHOW ARE YOU READY FOR TOMORROW I'M AS READY AS I'M GOING TO BE I THINK YEAH

SOME ARE TRYING TO FIND A SENSE OF ROUTINE OR FIND A FAMILY OF FOUR RIFLING THROUGH POTENTIAL SCHOOL CLOTHING
THERE ARE OTHERS HERE FOR A BREAK LIKE THE DRIVERS HAVE BEEN HELPING FAMILIES GET TO SAFETY I'M A BUS DRIVER SAY ABOUT YOU IT
WE'RE STILL HE'D NOW QUEUING THEIR PAPERS UP AND FORD NOW BREED NOW THEY CALL UP TOMORROW
WHICH IS BUSY BUSY BUSY TRYING TO GET PEOPLE'S LIVES
THOSE THAT JUST MISS THEIR FURRY FRIENDS SO WHAT'S YOUR NAME
ALFIE SOPHIE HOW OLD ARE YOU SIX TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU WORRIED
ME WE'RE VERY WORRIED ABOUT CHARLIE SOPHIE'S DAYCARE HAD A LITTLE DURABLE LEFT BEHIND AND HE WAS RESCUED TODAY WE'RE VERY GLAD
YOU MADE IT OUT SO IT'S ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU EVACUATE
LAURA BICKER REPORTING THERE NEVER IS ANOTHER WORRY BEYOND THOSE VERY PERSONAL WORRIES WE'VE JUST BEEN HEARING NAMELY THAT THE FIRE ITSELF WILL CREATE HEAT WHICH WILL FOR THE EARTH AND ALLOW OUT AN AWFUL LOT OF CARBON TO BE RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE CAUSING GREATER GLOBAL WARNING A MAN HE KNOWS ABOUT THAT IS DOCTOR IAN HARTLEY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM SCIENCE OF ECSTASY EXETER UNIVERSITY JOINS US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU DOCTOR HARDLY GOOD MORNING DESCRIBE IF YOU WERE THE PROCESS FOR US OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
WHEN YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD FOREST VEGETATION CAN ACTUALLY PROTECT THE PERMAFROST SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S VERY WARM IN SUMMER IN THESE AREAS CAN BE OVER THIRTY DEGREES YOU CAN STILL HAVE FROZEN SOIL JUST A FEW TEN CENTIMETRES BELOW THE SOIL SURFACE
THE TREE SHADE THE SOIL BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THAT THERE'S A LAYER OF THICK MOSS IN THESE FORESTS WHICH DRIES OUT IN SUMMER AND ACTS AS A REALLY EFFECTIVE AND SLATER
WHEN YOU HAVE A FIRE YOU LOSE THESE TREES YOU LOSE THE MOSS OR EVEN IF YOU DON'T LEAVE THE MOSS BECAUSE THE TREES ON PRESENT ANY MORE DRYING OUT THE MOSS IT'S NO LONGER AN EFFECTIVE INSULATOR
ADD TO THAT THE SOIL SURFACE BECOMES VERY DARK THEN THIS THE SYSTEM TO START TO WARM UP A LOT AND YOU CAN FOR THE SOIL REALLY QUITE SUBSTANTIAL BUT WHAT SORT OF SCALE OF RELEASE A GREENHOUSE GASES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT WILD FIRES NOT JUST FOR YEARS BUT FOR CENTURIES AND THAT THE PLANET COPES
YES AND I'M NOT TRYING TO STRESS AND HE SORT OF APOCALYPTIC SCENARIO HERE BUT THE FIRE FREQUENCY HAS INTENSELY HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS FOR EXAMPLE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WAS A STRONG RECORD YEAR WE'VE REALLY SUBSTANTIAL AREAS OF FOREST BURNING PERHAPS IN CANADA TWICE THE SIZE OF THE AREA TWICE THE SIZE OF WALES MIGHT HAVE BURNT INTO US AND FOURTEEN
THIS IS POTENTIALLY BECOMING A SERIOUS ISSUE RAISES THE QUESTION OF COURSE WHAT MORE CAN YOU DO OTHER THAN WHAT IS ALREADY BEING DONE BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY ARE TRYING TO PUT THE FIRE OUT QUICKLY AS THEY CAN BUT IT IS MIGHTY HARD TO DO IT
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE CAN MANAGE THESE THESE ECOSYSTEMS DIRECTLY ABOUT THEIR COLOSSAL
BUT THESE ARE ECOSYSTEM THAT WE THINK HAVE BEEN HELPING US QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE SO THEY'VE BEEN ABSORBING CARBON FOR A LONG TIME BUT AS WE GET MORE THESE SORTS OF DISTURBANCES FIRES AND ALSO INSECT OUTBREAKS IN PARTS OF THE CANADIAN FORESTS THEY MAY NO LONGER BE HELPING US SHE'S STARTING TO RELEASE CARBON THAT'S QUITE A WORRYING SCENARIO IF WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND KEEP CLIMATE CHANGE TO LESS THAN TWO DEGREES DOCTOR HARTLEY IN EXETER THANK YOU JOIN US
TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST EIGHT TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND GARY'S BACK WITH US HELLO GARY SARAH GOOD MORNING IT'S GOING TO BE AN ANXIOUS DAY AHEAD FOR THE ARSENAL STRIKER DANNY WELBECK WHO'S GOING TO HAVE A SCAN ON HIS KNEE THAT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER HE'S GOING TO BE FIT ENOUGH TO BE INCLUDED IF SELECTED IN THE ENGLAND SQUAD WHICH WAS NAMED ON THURSDAY FOR THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS PARCELS TWO TWO DRAW WITH MANCHESTER CITY MEANS CITY COULD MISS OUT ON THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE PLACE IF MANCHESTER UNITED WIN THEIR REMAINING TWO MATCHES THE FIRST OF THOSE
IS TOMORROW AT LEICESTER CITY THEY'LL HAVE NO SUCH WORRIES OF COURSE HAVING BEEN CROWNED PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONS ON SATURDAY THE QUESTION NOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT FOR LEICESTER I SPOKE TO FORMER LEICESTER PLAYER PETER SHILTON HE'S VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR PROSPECTS NEXT SEASON
WELL I CERTAINLY THINK THEY'LL HAVE A CHANCE OF WOMEN IT AGAIN I THINK THAT THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULDN'T IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY HARD THIS YEAR AFTER TWO TO DO IT BUT I THINK THEY'VE GOT A VERY GOOD CHANCE BUT CERTAINLY IN THE TOP SIX DO YOU THINK THOUGH THAT THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE MIGHT BE A HINDRANCE GREAT THAT THEY'RE INEPT BUT OF COURSE IT WOULD MEAN THEM PLAYING LOTS MORE MATCHES
THAT'S THE POINT REALLY THEY WANT TO DO WELL IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE I THINK WOULD BE THE PRIORITY REALLY TOO AFTER ALL THE HARD WORK THEY'LL WANT TO GOOD RUN AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE LEN HUNT'S REPUTATION OBVIOUSLY IN DOING THAT AND THAT'S GOING TO BE MORE GAMES SO IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FOR THEM TO WHERE TO CONCENTRATE
ON ON ON THE LEAGUE AS WELL BUT I'M SURE THEY'LL LINK IMPROVE THE SQUAD AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP AND WHAT IMPACT CAN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE PLAYING IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE AGAINST THE VERY VERY TOP TEAMS OF EUROPE
WASN'T THE BEST TEAM IN ENGLAND BY FAR YOU KNOW THEY'VE ALL SEASON THEY DOMINATE THE LEAGUE AND THIS STYLE OF FOOTBALL THAT THEY HAVE VERY STRONG DEFENSIVELY YESTERDAY WHEN THEY LOST THAT LATE GOAL YOU COULD SEE THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE GOALKEEPER AND BACK FOR THEY'VE GOT THIS RELATIONSHIP DON'T LOSE A LOT OF GOALS AND HAVE GOT PACE AND ABILITY AND ATTACK IT'S A FORMULA FOR SUCCESS IN EUROPE
JAMIE AND RE ADMIRERS HAVE VERY MUCH BEEN THEIR STAR PLAYERS AND I'M SURE OF THE CLUBS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SIGNING THEM WOULD YOU STAY AT LEICESTER FOR ANOTHER SEASON IF YOU WITH THE LIKES OF WABI AND MORRIS OR SHOULD THEY PERHAPS CASHING IN
I WOULD DEFINITELY STATE I THINK WHAT THEY'VE ACHIEVED AS MADE THEM YOU KNOW ABSOLUTE LEGENDS IT'S THE GREATEST TEAM LESTER'S EVER HAD THE PLAYERS ARE GOING TO BE NO PROBABLY PUT STATUES OF THEM UP IN LEICESTER AND THEY DON'T WANT TO JUST WALK OUT THEY WANT TO SORT OF STAY IN THAT UNIT COS THEY LOOK VERY CLOSE AS A UNIT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THEY ACHIEVED WHAT THEY HAPPEN
GO AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO IN EUROPE YOU KNOW WHAT WHY GO ANYWHERE ELSE AT LASTLY YOU PLAYED FOR NOTTINGHAM FOREST AND THEY CAUSED A HUGE SURPRISE WINNING THE EUROPEAN CUP AND ALSO THE FIRST DIVISION AS IT WAS KNOWN IN THEN HOW DO YOU COMPARE THE TWO ACHIEVEMENTS LEICESTER AND NOTTINGHAM FOREST PETER
THE BOTH FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT IN THE FIRST SEASON WE WE THE FOREST GOT PROMOTION AND I JOINED UP SOME GAMES WE WON THE LEAGUE WITH GAMES TO SPARE LESTER'S STAYED OFF RELEGATION OF WON THE LEAGUE WITH GAMES TO SPARE
DIFFERENT ERAS I THINK WHAT THEY'VE DONE FOR FOOTBALLING MONT NEARER LEICESTER IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE UNDERDOG COMING GOOD THE STYLE THEY'VE DONE IT IN THERE THE WHOLE CLUB THE FAMILY ATMOSPHERE IS BROUGHT A BIT OF BELIEF BUT MONDAY FOOTBALL BUT WHAT WE DID AT FOREST
WAS WAS STILL INCREDIBLE AND THEN TO GO ON AND WIN TWO EUROPEAN CUPS ALY COOKS AND SUPER COPES YOU KNOW SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO DO TO ACTUALLY COMPARE THE TEAMS BUT IN THEIR FIRST SEASON THERE BOTH DO WE BOTH DID FANTASTICALLY WELL PETER SHILTON ON TO OTHER MATTERS HANDY MURRAY HEADS TO ROME TODAY HAVING PLAYED REALLY WELL IN THE FINAL OF THE MADRID MASTERS BUT HE WAS JUST EDGED OUT

GARY THIS MORNING AFTER NINE WE START THE WEEK WITH OF COURSE ANDY MOORE AND HE'S HERE WITH US
IN THE STUDIO HI NICK YES THIS WEEK MAY MARK THE REAL BEGINNING OF SUMMER BUT IN HUNDREDS IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS AT ANY RATE IT ALSO MARKS THE BEGINNING OF SAT'S THE STANDARD ASSESSMENT TESTS SO IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE'LL BE LOOKING TODAY AT THE VERY FUTURE OF EDUCATION FROM INSPIRATIONAL COMPUTER BASED SCHEMES UP ENDING LEARNING ACROSS THE WORLD TO REFLECTIONS OF A FORMER ETON HEADMASTER AND FOCUSING ESPECIALLY ON CLASS RATHER THAN SIMPLY THE CLASSROOM LINDSAY HANLEY ON HER OWN QUEST FOR RESPECTABILITY
DO WE STILL ACTUALLY NEED SCHOOLS START THE WEEK AT NINE THAT IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE VERY SUNNY TODAY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUNNY THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT IT'LL BE IN THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT IT IS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND NICK ROBINSON AND TIME FOR A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS NOW WITH CHRIS ALDRIDGE
DAVID CAMERON HAS WARNED THAT THE RISK OF INSTABILITY AND CONFLICT IN EUROPE WILL BE GREATER IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAD YOU IN A SPEECH HE'S GIVING AT THE MOMENT HE SAID THAT WHENEVER THE U.K. HAS TURNED ITS BACK ON EUROPE IT'S COME TO REGRET IT THOSE BACKING THE CAMPAIGN OF SAID DEMOCRACY AND NATO HAVE DONE MORE FOR PEACE THAT THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE DOCTORS' UNION THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WILL RESTART TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT TODAY IN AN ATTEMPT TO END THE DISPUTE THAT SLED TO STRIKES AT HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND RESEARCHERS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY SAY DATA INDICATING HIGHER DEATH RATES AMONG PATIENTS ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL ON SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS IS FLAWED
A B.B.C. NEWS TEAM IS BEING EXPELLED FROM NORTH KOREA FOR WHAT OFFICIALS THERE HAVE DESCRIBED AS IMPROPER REPORTING THE THREE WERE DETAINED AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO BOARD A FLIGHT ONE WAS QUESTIONED FOR EIGHT HOURS
WORKERS WHO SAY THEY WERE BLACKLISTED BY CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES HAVE WON COMPENSATION AFTER A LONG RUNNING LEGAL BATTLE THE UNITE UNION HAS REACHED A SETTLEMENT THAT WILL SEE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX WORKERS SHARING MORE THAN TEN MILLION POUNDS
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE THE B.B.C. DID VERY WELL AT THE BAFTAS LAST NIGHT NOT LEAST WITH WINS FOR WOLF HALL IN THE SITCOM CAR SHARE BUT WITH THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WAITING DEL UNVEILING HIS PROPOSALS FOR REFORMING THE B.B.C. LATER THIS WEEK IT WAS FEARS ABOUT THOSE CHANGES WHICH QUICKLY TOOK CENTRE STAGE HERE'S WHAT THE DIRECTOR OF WOLF HALL PETER COS MINSKY SAID WHEN HE WENT UP TO COLLECT HIS BAFTA
THE B. B. C. IN CHANNEL FOUR WHICH THEY'RE ALSO ATTEMPTING TO EVISCERATE IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD AND WE SHOULD STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR IT NOT LET IT GO BY DEFAULT
BLINK AND IT WILL BE GONE THERE'LL BE NO MORE WOOL FALLS NO MORE AWARD WINNING DISPATCHES DOCUMENTARIES ON CHANNEL FOUR JUST TO BROADCASTING LANDSCAPE WHERE THE ONLY DETERMINANT OF WHETHER SOMETHING GETS MADE IS WHETHER IT'S LIKELY TO LINE THE POCKETS OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS NOAH
AND HE RECEIVED A STANDING OVATION FOR THAT SPEECH WHEN WE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY JESSE NORMAN A CONSERVATIVE M.P. WHO CHAIRS THE CULTURE MEDIA AND SPORT COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SIR FROM ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES HERE AS WE'RE NOT DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE'S GOING TO COME OUT IN THIS WHITE PAPER AND IS PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY BUT FROM YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH JOHN WAITING DALE ON WHAT SCALE IS IT IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS SOME OF THE GREATEST REFORMED IN THE HISTORY OF THE B.B.C.
WELL THE ANSWER IS I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE WHITE PAPER APART FROM JOHN WISHING DOWN HIS IMMEDIATE CIRCLE AND PRESUMABLY THE FOLKS AT THE TOP OF B. B. C. I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE DOES EITHER AND WE'RE LAST NIGHT'S WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT AND YOU KNOW WHY WHEN INCREDIBLE OCCASION FOR MY SKIN OTHERS TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS AND RIGHTLY SO MY JOB AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE IS TO HOLD THE B. B. C. IS TO HOLD THE RESPECTIVE ESTATES AND THE DEPARTMENT FOR CULTURE AND SPORT TO ACCOUNT WE ALREADY PUBLISHED
REPORT INTO THE B. B. C. WHICH CELEBRATED IT AS AN INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL BROADCASTER AND STAND IT FOR EXCELLENCE AND AS A PLACE THAT GIVES THE PUBLIC SPHERE IN THIS COUNTRY AN EXTRAORDINARY QUALITY I'M SHARED BY ANY OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD SO OUR FEELINGS ABOUT THAT I THINK ACROSS PARTIES ARE CLEAR WE MADE SOME CHANGES AND SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE B.B.C. SHOULD BE GOVERNED BUT WE HAVEN'T YET COME TO ANY OF THE ISSUES IN THE WHITE PAPER AS FAR AS I KNOW AND
WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AFTER HE COMES OUT BUT ARE THEY RIGHT TO BE WORRIED PICK OR IS THIS IS THIS IS A SORT OF HYSTERICAL REACTION BUT IT'S PRE EMPTY OF OR ARE THEY RIGHT TO BE WORRIED THAT THERE IS A MOOD TO CHANGE THE B. B. C. SO FUNDAMENTALLY THAT PROGRAMME MAKING COULD BE DAMAGED IN THE WAY THAT THEY FEAR I THINK YOURS HAS NO ONE KNOWS IF YOU LOOK AT THE EVENTS LAST YEAR THERE CERTAINLY WAS A POINT WHICH WE WERE ALL THE CRITICAL OF
FIRST REPORT WE DID WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ESSENTIALLY BOUNCE THE B.B.C. INTO EACH SETTLEMENT OVER THE LICENCE FEE AND THAT WAS REGARDED WITH EXTREME CONCERN BY MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE PEOPLE SPECTRUM IN THE PUBLIC MORE WIDELY SO
THERE IS SOME CONCERN ABOUT THAT HISTORICALLY BUT ALSO THERE HAVE BEEN MANY POSITIVE THINGS AT THE GUM TO ON TO REASSURE AND TO SUPPORT THE B. B. C. AND I DON'T THINK THEREFORE THAT WE SHOULD BE PREJUDGING WHAT THEY WERE TO SEE WHAT'S IN IT AND THEN COME TO A SOBER REASONED VIEW OF IT WE DO KNOW FROM MODERN HAS DOES APPEAR TO HAVE HOPES CAN COME OUT THAT THERE ARE PLANS TO CHANGE WHAT WE KNOW THE PLANS TO CHANGE THE GOVERNANCE BUT ONE OF THE PROPOSALS IS THAT THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHO SIT ON THE TRUST THE OVERSEEING BODY
WELL THE WAY IT WORKS AND NOW IS THAT THE B. B. C. HAS A TRUST WHICH IS APPOINTED THROUGH PUBLIC COMPETITION FOR TRUSTEES ON THE NOMINATION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND FORMS OF GOVERNMENT OF THAT THAT IS ACCEPTED MECHANISM NO ONE'S COMPLAINED ABOUT THAT MECHANISM FOR POINTING A TRUST AND THE TRUST AS A OF THE DIRECTOR GENERAL
BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT RIGHT BUT WE'RE MOVING TO IF I MAY SAY SO IT WAS A DIFFERENT TEXTURE DIFFERENT MODEL AND WE'VE RECOMMENDED THAT IN THE COMANCHE REVIEWS RECOMMENDED WHICH IS A UNITARY BOUGHT THAT'S POTENTIALLY A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE B.B.C. IT CREATES MORE AUTHORITY AND POWER WITHIN THE ORGANISATION IT BRINGS THE CHAIR AND THE TUBES ELECTIVE CLOSER AND DOESN'T WITHOUT ITS INDEPENDENT WELL WELL THAT'S THE QUESTION SO IF YOU HAVE THAT AND YOU TIE IT TO AN EXPLICITLY POLITICAL PROCESS OF NOMINATING GOVERNORS THEN YOU WOULD ALL DIRECTORS THEN I THINK YOU'D BE
SERIOUSLY THERE'LL BE SERIOUS CAUSE FOR CONCERN BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S IN THE FRAME AS WE KNOW AT THE MOMENT FAR AS WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT FROM LORD ALI EARLIER WHO HAD A LABOUR PEER WHO IS PART OF A CROSS PARTY MOVE TO TRY TO MAKE A PRE EMPTY OF SORT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CONCERN IS THAT CHANGES COULD BE MADE WITHOUT LEGISLATION BUT HE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT ABOLISHING THE LICENCE FEE AND STOPPING THE B. B. C. FROM MAKING POPULAR PROGRAMMES
ARE THOSE IN THE PROPOSAL I MEAN AS WE'VE DISCUSSED NO ONE KNOWS WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT CHANGING THE LICENCE FEE INTO A HOUSEHOLD LEVY PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO SECURE THE REVENUE STREAM FOR THE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF CONCERNS ABOUT THAT IT WOULD BE A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE WAY THE B. B. C. IS FUNDED NOT BY ANY MEANS NECESSARILY A BAD THING BUT A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF
WAIT AND SEE LET'S BE CLEAR THE WHITE PAPER'S NOT THE DECISION THE WHITE PAPER IS IT DOCUMENT WHICH WILL ITSELF RECEIVE EXTENSIVE REVIEW AND PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE CLOSING THE BOOK ON THE B. B. C. BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN READ IT JESSE NORMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NADA PUTS THE COUNTRY TO SHAME SO SAID LABOUR'S YVETTE COOPER WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER WAS RESISTING CALLS ON THE GOVERNMENT TO OFFER REFUGE TO THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WHO MADE THE JOURNEY TO EUROPE ALONE
WILL YOU RECONSIDER HIS POSITION ON ALF DUBS AMENDMENT BEFORE IT COMES BACK TO THE BOAT
AND STOP WITH HIS ATTITUDE TO LONE CHILD REFUGEES PUTTING THIS HOUSE AND THIS COUNTRY TO SHARE
WELL DAVID CAMERON INITIALLY IN INSISTED THAT IT WOULD SIMPLY CONVINCED MORE PARENTS TO TAKE THE RISK OF SENDING THEIR CHILDREN ACROSS THE SCENE OVER BORDERS BUT HE HAS SINCE DONE A U. TURN THE DETAILS OF WHICH PARLIAMENT WILL DISCUSS TODAY
WE'LL SPEAK TO YVETTE COOPER JUST A MOMENT FIRST OF THE B.B.C.'S DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT PAUL ADAMS HAS BEEN TO GERMANY WHICH IS OPENED ITS DOORS TO MORE MIGRANTS THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN EUROPE HE WENT TO FIND OUT HOW THEY'VE BEEN COPING WITH A HUGE INFLUX OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN MAINLY FROM AFGHANISTAN AND SYRIA
IT'S AN INCONGRUOUS SIGHT AFGHAN TEENAGERS THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM HOME WITH OUR PARENTS OR SIBLINGS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO ROW ON A TRANQUIL STRETCH OF THE MOULD A RIVER IN THE HEART OF PICTURESQUE SAXONY
AWAY FROM THE DAILY DANGERS OF LIFE AT HOME THE BOYS SEEM HAPPY AND SETTLED BUT VULNERABLE TOO
BUS WAS A LITTLE ON THE CIVIL WAR COME ON I HAD PROBLEMS SO I LOVE MY COUNTRY I CAME HERE TO THIS COUNTRY AT THIS YOUNG AGE MY GOD HELP ME IT IS NOT CLEAR WHEN I'LL GO BACK TO MY COUNTRY
HELLO THERE FEEL ASCH HE SAYS HARNESSED THEIR ONE AS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I FEEL SAFE IN AFGHANISTAN ANY MINUTE SOMETHING DEVASTATING CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE WE ALWAYS LIVED WITH FEAR
AFGHAN AND SYRIAN REFUGEE STARTED ARRIVING AT THE PAUL GOING TO SCHOOL IN NEARBY GUY TIME IN FEBRUARY NOW THERE'S A WHOLE CLASS OF THEM BEING TAUGHT GERMAN AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE BEFORE BEING INTEGRATED INTO THE SCHOOL
MOST ARE UNACCOMPANIED AT FOURTEEN HAD YOU TOOLA IS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST FOR HIM THIS ISN'T JUST A NEW SCHOOL IT'S HIS FIRST SCHOOL THEY GIVE THEIR DO HELLO HELLO ORLA MORE MUD DELBERT COMBO UNDERSTAND HALL I WANT TO GET AN EDUCATION BECAUSE IN AFGHANISTAN I NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL
I HAD TO WORK DOWN HERE AND A GOOD SCHOOL I LIKE IT SO MUCH
IT'S ALL VERY NEW FOR THOMAS SUL FELT TOO HE'S TEACHING FOR THE FIRST TIME JUGGLING STUDENTS OF DIFFERENT AGES AND ABILITIES CONSCIOUS OF A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE THESE BEWILDERED NEW ARRIVALS THE BEST POSSIBLE START
I SEE HOW THERE COMMUNICATE AND THAT THEY SEE ME A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT LIKE A FATHER
I GIVE THEM MY HAND MY HELP BECAUSE I KNOW THAT FOR THEM THE SCHOOL YEAR
IT'S A PEACEFUL PLACE
BREAK TIME THE NEW ARRIVALS KEEP MOSTLY TO THEMSELVES THEY'VE ONLY BEEN HERE A FEW WEEKS AND GUY TIME HAS NEVER HAD TO HANDLE AN INFLUX LIKE THIS BEFORE
THE TOWN IS TINY WITH AN AGEING POPULATION AND TRADITIONAL VALUES THERE'S PLENTY OF GOODWILL TOWARDS THE NEW ARRIVALS BUT SCEPTICISM TO ABOUT WHAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT HAS DONE CLASS DIETER OBVIOUSLY RUNS A SMALL SHOE SHOP JUST OFF THE MAIN SQUARE
AS THIS MISSION OR YOUR CARE IN MY OPINION IT'S NOT RIGHT NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD JUST OPENS UP THE BORDERS AND LET'S ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MARCHING COMPLETELY UNCONTROLLED OUR WAY OF THINKING IS THIS IF THEY COME TO US THEY HAVE TO ADAPT TO FIT IN WITH US
HELLO AND AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL DAY THE AFGHAN BOYS LISTEN TO MUSIC FROM HOME PLAY CARDS AND CEMENT THEIR NEW BOND AS BROTHERS IN EXILE
THEY'RE HERE BECAUSE LAST YEAR THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL SAID ALL REFUGEES WERE WELCOME IT HASN'T BEEN UNIVERSALLY POPULAR BUT DEATH LEFT RHODA WHO'S BEEN RUNNING THIS TEMPORARY HOME SINCE THE END OF LAST YEAR SAYS MISSUS MERKEL HAS HIS WHOLE HEARTED SUPPORT
AMELA METAL HAS NOT BEEN MY CHANCE LAW BEFORE HER BUT WHEN SHE WAS SEB I US REFUGEES SHOULD THAT POLITICAL SEWERS SIDE LIKE A POLITICAL SEWERS HAD HERSELF MY CHANCELLOR SHE'S A RIOTOUS WOMAN ABSOLUTELY
FOR NOW THE AFGHAN BOYS ARE SAFE BEING WELL LOOKED AFTER AND SLOWLY INTEGRATED INTO THIS QUIET CORNER OF GERMANY
YVETTE COOPER THERE WHO AS I SAY NOT ONLY HIGHLIGHTED THE CASE NAILS COMMONS BUT HE'S COME BACK RECENTLY FROM A VISIT TO GREECE SOME MY HEAR THAT TAPE AND SAY THEY'RE OUR CHILDREN BEING WELL CARED FOR WHO DO YOU HAVE FUTURES THEY ARE ALREADY IN WHAT WE WOULD CALL SAFE COUNTRIES GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE WHY THE NEED TO BRING THEM IN PARTICULAR HERE
IT'S GREAT THAT SOME CHILDREN AREN'T GETTING THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT MORE THAN AREN'T SO THERE'S AROUND TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN TEENAGERS WHO HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED IN EUROPE PROBABLY INTO THE ARMS OF THE SMUGGLE GANGS ARE TRAFFICKERS ABUSE RINGS OR PROSTITUTION AND IN GREECE WHERE WE WERE LAST WEEK
UNICEF AND SAVE THE CHILDREN ESTIMATE AROUND TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO AREN'T IN PROPER SUPPORT AND THERE'S ONLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED PLACES IN CHILDREN'S SHELTER SO THE REST ARE EITHER SLEEPING ROUGH OR THEY ARE IN MAKESHIFT CAMPS ALONG WITH ADULTS ON THEIR HUGE RISK YOU KNOW THE FEAR THERE WE SAW FIGURES YESTERDAY SHOWING HOW OVERCROWDED SCHOOLS WERE THE OFFICIAL FIGURES SAID THAT WE NEED THE EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY SEVEN NEW SECONDARY SCHOOLS TO COPE WITH PEOPLE JUST COMING IN FROM LEGAL MIGRATION
WHY TAKE THE RISK OF ADDING TO THAT NUMBER I THINK WE HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT WHEN YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN WHO OR SLEEPING SLEEPING ROUGH AT RISK OF SUCH ABUSE AND VULNERABLE AND BEAR IN MIND THAT THE FIGURES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LESS THAN ONE PER CENT OF THE NET IMMIGRATION THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS THEIR PARENTS ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW A MAN MORE CHILDREN MAY FOLLOW THAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE WITH AMERICA OVER THE MEXICAN BORDER FOR EXAMPLE
IN FACT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IS THAT THEY WOULD ONLY TAKE THOSE WHO HAVE ARRIVED ALREADY IN EUROPE BEFORE THE E.U. TURKEY DEAL WAS PUT IN PLACE AND THAT IS PREVENTING A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKING THEIR DANGEROUS JOURNEY IN THE FIRST PLACE WHATEVER YOU THINK OF IT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH IT
BUT IT IS PREVENTING MORE PEOPLE MAKING THAT DANGEROUS JOURNEY HOWEVER THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN UNACCOMPANIED WHO ARE AT RISK ACROSS EUROPE AND WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAVE A DUTY AND MORE RESPONSIBILITY TO DO OUR BIT THAT'S WHY WAS SAYING THAT WE SHOULD MIX TURNED THIS INTO PRACTICE BECAUSE THE SHIFT IN PRINCIPLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD DO OUR BIT BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IN PRACTICE AND YOU WANT IT TO MEAN WHAT IN TERMS OF NUMBERS AND WHAT
IN TERMS OF MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE HEARING FROM A SENIOR FIGURE IN A COUNCIL EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME SAYING HOW STRETCHED THEY FELT OF COURSE THERE'S GOT TO BE THE RESOURCES ON THE SUPPORT AND TO BE FAIR TO THE GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT WITH THE WIDER SYRIAN REFUGEE PROGRAMME THEY HAVE PUT IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES NEED THEY WOULD NEED TO DO SO AGAIN AND IT NEEDS TO BE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO HELP
I THINK WE SHOULD BE AIMING TO GET CHILDREN IN BEFORE THE SCHOOL STARTS IN SEPTEMBER AND WE'VE GOT RELIGIOUS LEADERS BISHOPS CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THREE HUNDRED CHILDREN BUYING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AND IN ADDITION TO THOSE WHO ASK CURRENTLY STUCK IN THE BUREAUCRACY OF THE FAMILY REUNIFICATION SYSTEM KIDS WHO'VE GOT FAMILY HERE WHO COULD BE LOOKING AFTER THEM DON'T LET YOU GO WITHOUT ASKING YOU ABOUT THOSE ELECTIONS
SO DE KHAN RIGHT THE NEW MAYOR OF LONDON WHO HE SAYS IN EFFECT JEREMY CORBIN'S TALKING TO HIS ALLIES IN THE LABOUR PARTY NOT REACHING OUT TO VOTERS WILL CITY IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU DO HAVE TO REACH OUT IN ORDER TO WIN SUPPORT AND YOU CAN DO THAT AND BUILD A STRONG PROGRESSIVE ACTS COALITION AND SUPPORT ACROSS THE CAPITAL IT'S GREAT THAT SIDDIQUE ONE BUT OBVIOUSLY WE A GRIM RESULTS IN SCOTLAND AND US AS JEREMY SAID WE ONLY HUNG ON ACROSS ENGLAND
THAT IS NOT ENOUGH IN ORDER FOR US TO WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION AND WE SHOULD ALL OF US REMEMBER THAT THAT GENERAL ELECTION MIGHT COME RATHER SOONER THAN ANYBODY EXPECTED MAY COME RATHER SOONER THAN TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT IS WHY WE SHOULD GO FOR IT EXACTLY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE TORY PARTY AS TO WHAT POINT THEY WILL CHANGE LEADERS WHAT THAT MIGHT CHANGE AND THEREFORE WE NEED A PLAN AND A STRATEGY TO WIN BACK VOTES ACROSS THE COUNTRY COS WE NEED A LABOUR GOVERNMENT PEOPLE ACROSS BRITAIN NEED A LABOUR GOVERNMENT YVETTE COOPER INTERESTING PROSPECT A CHANGE OF
PRIME MINISTER AND LEK SHOULDN'T PUT I DIDN'T ASK YOU BETTER CHANGE LABOUR LEAD BUT WE'LL GET YOU BACK ON TO TALK ABOUT THAT THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE A FEW HOURS AGO PRINCE HARRY OPENED THE INVICTUS GAMES IN FLORIDA IT'S THE SECOND SUCH EVENT CREATED BY PRINCE HARRY HIMSELF ONE HUNDREDS OF SICK AND INJURED SOLDIERS FROM THE U.K. AND ITS MILITARY ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD A CORRESPONDENT A LEMUR BORDER'S BEEN AT THE CEREMONY IN ORLANDO AND HE SPOKE TO US ABOUT IT A SHORT WHILE AGO
WELL THE OPENING CEREMONY FOR THE SECOND INVICTUS GAMES IS OVER THERE PEOPLE HAVE STREAMED OUT OF THE STADIUM AND IT WAS REALLY AT SOME POINTS A VERY EMOTIONAL EVENT WITH SOME OF THE VETERANS WHO WERE INJURED IN SERVICE TELLING THEIR STORIES BORN OF THE KEYNOTE SPEAKERS OF COURSE WAS PRINCE HARRY WHO GAVE VERY PERSONAL SPEECH
AND TALKED OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCE IN HIS TEN YEARS IN THE ARMY TALKING OF HOW HE WENT FROM SOMEONE WHO JUST WANTED TO BE PART
OF THE SERVICES BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE AS HE SAID ONE OF THE GUYS TO LEARNING THAT IN HIS PRIVILEGED POSITION YOU COULD DO SOMETHING FOR THOSE WHO SUFFER
BUT HE DID ALSO FOCUS ON ONE THING WHICH IS A REAL THEME OF THESE GAMES WHICH IS THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS AND HE WASN'T THERE JUST TALKING ABOUT SERVICE MEN AND THOSE WHO WERE ATTENDING THE GAMES TO GO ALL OF THOSE OF YOU WATCHING AT HOME AND YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS IN SILENCE
WHETHER A VETERAN OR A CIVILIAN MUM OR A DAD
A TEENAGER OR A GRANDPARENT
I HOPE YOU SEE THE BRAVERY OF OUR INVICTUS CHAMPIONS WHO HAVE CONFRONTED INVISIBLE INJURIES AND I HOPE YOU'RE INSPIRED TO ASK FOR THE HELP THAT YOU NEED
THERE ARE THOSE WHO OPEN THESE GAMES WAS THE FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA THE FOCUS OF HER SPEECH WORDS NOT JUST ON THOSE INSPIRATIONAL ATHLETES THAT WERE ATTENDING BUT ALSO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO WERE INJURED WE KNOW HOW YOU ALL DROP EVERYTHING WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE THE ONE WITH THE INJURED
OW YOU STEPPED UP TO MEN AT ALL THE APPOINTMENTS IN THE MEDICATION ALL THE FINANCES
OFTEN JUGGLING A JOB RAISING KIDS AT THE SAME TIME
AND ULTIMATELY THAT'S REAL LEE WHAT BEING THIS GAMES AND JOINING FORCES
WE JUST AS THE OPENING CEREMONY ENDED I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE BRITISH ATHLETES WHO'S HERE CYCLIST CALLED CRAIG PREECE BOTH OF HIS LEGS WERE BADLY DAMAGED BY AN I.E.D. AFGHANISTAN AND HE WAS HERE WITH HIS WIFE ALISON
THE WHOLE OPENING CEREMONY
A GOOD THING THAT'S BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AS OBVIOUSLY AS THOSE HIDDEN WOUND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE WALKING ABOUT WITH ALL THE LIMBS AND PEOPLE THINK OH THERE'S ACTUALLY NOTHING WRONG
REALLY THAT THEY'RE SUFFERING AS MUCH AS US SO I THINK THAT CAME ACROSS VERY WELL IN THE OPENING CEREMONY
ORDINARY ZIPPY YOUR WE RECOGNISE TODAY AS WELL AND WITH THESE VERY I THINK
I'VE GOTTEN REALLY THAT WE JUST GOT ON WITH IT AND LIKE OBVIOUSLY BRINGING UP TWO CHILDREN WORKING FULL TIME AT THAT ALL THEM REALLY TRAINED TO MAKE WITH THAT EXACTLY
HAVE TO TAKE IT MAKING SURE EVERYTHING SORT OF CELTIC TOBY REALLY WHAT ABOUT
I THINK THE GAMES IT'S A CHANCE FOR INJURED SERVICEMEN TO SHOWCASE IN THE WORLD KNOW LIKE HE SAYS AND I AM WHERE UNCONQUERED
WE GET TO SHOWCASE OF THE WORLD NOW WHAT WE CAN STILL DO WELL NOW OF COURSE THE FOCUS IS ON FOUR DAYS OF COMPETITION IN TEN SPORTS
MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED ATHLETES AND IT'S NOT ABOUT INSPIRATIONAL WORDS BUT ABOUT INSPIRATIONAL FEET HELENE MONTH BALL REPORTING THERE TEN MINUTES TONIGHT
NOW IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THE PRIME MINISTER'S USED A SPEECH TO WALK IN A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WOULD ENDANGER PEACE AND SECURITY IN EUROPE AND ARGUING THAT HISTORY SHOWS THAT BRITAIN CAN'T STAND ASIDE FROM CONFLICT ON THE CONTINENT CHALLENGING THE PRIME MINISTER'S ARGUMENT IS A WOMAN HE APPOINTED TO BE A DEFENCE MINISTER PENNY MORTON'S SHE'S PASSED THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AND SHE JOINS US FROM OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DO YOU ACCEPT THE CORE OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S ARGUMENT THAT A DANGEROUS TIME
AN UNSTABLE TIME BRICKS IT IS BOUND TO WEAKEN THE GLUE THAT HOLDS THE NATIONS OF EUROPE TOGETHER NO I DO NOT THE THE LEAF CAMPAIGN WANT TO DRAG THE PRIME MINISTER
TO THE THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TODAY OUR BORDERS THE SECURITY RISK THAT COME FROM ACCESSION COUNTRIES AND TO OUR OPERATIONAL SECURITY AND WHAT WE NEED TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE TODAY YOUR BALONEY BRINGING US HIS ARM YES THE PRIME MINISTER TODAY IS IS TRYING TO TAP INTO A A VISION WHICH I THINK WE ALL SHARE OF NATIONS LIVING IN PEACE LOOKING WEST A SECURE AND PROSPEROUS WHAT IS
BEING DEBATED THOUGH IS THAT THE E.U. IS A NECESSARY TO THAT AND I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT ITS CURRENT TRAJECTORIES ABSOLUTELY COUNTER TO THAT AT THE SAME TIME HE'S TELLING US WE ARE HEADING FOR WAR IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. IS DENYING US THE TOOLS WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR OWN CITIZENS AND LOTS OF EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU IN THIS SENSE ISN'T THERE WHICH IS IN A POLE IT'S A SUMMARY HAVE DONE RIGHT ACROSS THE E.U.
WHAT WOULD BE THE RESPONSE OF THE PEOPLES OF EUROPE TO BRECHT'S IT THEY WOULD DEMAND THEIR REFERENDUM AND MORE PEOPLE WOULD DEMAND TO GET OUT THE E.U. NOW WHAT WOULD BE INTERESTED TO KNOW IS DO YOU WELCOME HOW DO YOU THINK YES LET'S GO LET'S GET OTHER COUNTRIES OUT THE YOU WHAT DO YOU HOPE THEY'LL STAY TOGETHER AND WE'LL JUST WALK AWAY I THINK IT'S WORTH ASKING WHY
COUNTRIES ARE ARE SAYING THAT IT IS BUT IF ASK YOU WHETHER IT'LL HAPPEN NOT WHAT I KNOW I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT WHY LOOK THE THE THE REASON WHY THE E.U. IS NOT DELIVERING EITHER ON SECURITY OR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY IS IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT DOING WHAT IT'S NATION STATES NEED IN ORDER TO THRIVE IT IS CAUSING TREMENDOUS FRAGMENTATION THE RISE OF FAR RIGHT POLITICS ALL THE THINGS AT THE PRIME MINISTER A WARNING US COULD HAPPEN IF WE LEAVE OUR HERE NOW TODAY
HE WAS ARGUING THAT IT WOULD MAKE THINGS BETTER THOSE ALL THOSE TENSIONS CREATED NOBODY DIES IT BY THE EUROZONE CRISIS ALL THE TENSIONS CREATED BY THE MIGRATION CRISIS YOU ARE ARGUING THAT IF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD ONE OF THE BIGGEST MILITARY POWERS ONE OF THE GREATEST ECONOMIC POWER VOTES TO LEE
THAT WILL SOMEHOW REDUCE THOSE TENSIONS I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE OF VERY VERY COMMON REASONS FIRSTLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET BACK CONTROL OF OUR OWN BORDERS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FINE I'M GOING TO LIKE MAKE THAT ARGUMENT TODAY WHAT HAPPENS IN EUROPE IS WE'VE ALSO AS WELL AS IT BEING A BETTER DEAL FOR THE U.K. IT WILL
GIVE THE REMAINING E.U. STATES A CATALYST FOR REFORM YOU COULD SEE TO THE TAIL END OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S NEGOTIATIONS OTHER NATIONS SAYING TO YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THAT SOUNDS VERY SENSIBLE WE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THAT TOO SO YOU MISS YOUR ABOUT THE CLUB JUST TO HELP YOU KNOW WE HAVE TRIED ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING TO GET THE E.U. TO REFORM FROM WITHIN THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE I THINK TO GET IT
TO START TO GET BACK TO ITS DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES TO ACTUALLY START DOING WHAT IT'S NATION STATES NEED BOTH IN TERMS OF SECURITY AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY CERTAIN YEAH WHAT WITH RESPECT AND YOU ARE A RELATIVELY JUNIOR MINISTER FAIRLY NEW TO THIS CAN YOU NAME A SINGLE WORLD LEADER
WHO AGREES WITH YOU ON THIS AND LET'S LEAVE DONALD TRUMP OUCH
LOOK NO HEAD OF STATE OR OR PRIME MINISTER OR OPERA OR PRESIDENT IS GOING TO WANT TO ANNOY OUR PRIME MINISTER BUT THEY'RE ALL WHAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS THEY'RE BEING DIPLOMAT A BIG LONG LIST OF ADMIRALS GENERALS FORMER HEAD OF THE C.I.A. FORMER HEAD OF M.I.SIX WHO WHO THINK THAT WE WILL BE SAFER
IF WE LEAVE THE OTHER WORLD LEADER BUT RATHER THAN TRADE JOB TITLES THE PUBLIC WANT THE ARGUMENTS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO GIVE THEM WHY WILL BE SAFER WE NEED CONTROL OVER OUR BORDERS WE NEED THE E.U. TO STOP UNDERMINING OUR SECURITY FIVE AYE IT'S IN I WILL BE SAFER OUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
IT'S FIVE TO NINE WOULD WE BE BETTER GOVERNED IF WE HAD MORE INDEPENDENT POLITICIANS WITH FEWER BOUND TO TOE THE PARTY LINE AS THE THINKING BEHIND A NEW SIX MILLION POUND FUND BEING LAUNCHED THIS MORNING TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BECOME AN PEAS BUT DON'T WANT TO SIGN UP TO ANY ONE PARTY WERE ONE OF THOSE SUPPORTING THE CAMPAIGN IS LORD JONES DIGBY JONES HE'S ACROSS BENCH M.P. USED TO BE MINISTER OF STATE STATE FOR TRADE AT HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO AND WE JOINED RIGHT EXTRA STUDIO BY CLAIRE WRIGHT WHO WAS AN INDEPENDENT PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE
A YEAR AGO IN THE GENERAL ELECTION FOR EAST DEVON GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING EDIE COMING ACROSS BENCH M.P. OR MUCH ACROSS WHEN I WAS FOR THE PRANK I DON'T WORRY ABOUT US BUT I DON'T GET VOTED AND YET HERE YOU ARE SAYING LOOK GET I SUPPOSE HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CROSS BENCHERS IN THE CROSS BENCHES IN THE IN LIKE MAY AND NONE OF THAT PERSON ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN MY TIME AT SEA BEHIND THEN IN GOVERNMENT I I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE ARE CONSTITUENCIES IN THIS COUNTRY TORY AND LABOUR WHERE FRANK YOU COULD PUT A SHEEP UP IN BLUE OR RED AND GET IT IN AND SIX PEOPLE ON A SELECTION COMMITTEE
ACTUALLY TO BASICALLY THE M. P. BECAUSE THEIR SELECTION COMMITTEE FOR THE ONE POLITICAL PARTY IT'S A VERY SAFE SEAT READ OR BLOW IT A MATTER AND THEN THIS PERSON WHO ROCKS UP IN WESTMINSTER DONE NOTHING WITH THEIR LIVES PROBABLY
COULD COME BE BEEN IN A RESEARCH ASSISTANT IN GOVERNMENT SOMEWHERE AND THEN A SPECIAL ADVISOR THEY THEN SIT THERE THEY'RE TOLD HOW TO VOTE THEY ARE TOLD TO KEEP THE NOSE CLEAN THE WHIPS TELL HIM WHAT TO DO THEY HAVE NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A SAFE SEAT THIS IS YOUR DEMOCRACY IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE TRIBALISM OR PARTY OR CLARE OUT YOU TRIED TO BREAK THIS SYSTEM A YEAR AGO HOW WAS IT HOW DIFFICULT WAS IT
IT WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT I WAS UP AGAINST HUGO SWIRE WHO IS A FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER AND UM IT WAS IT WAS A LONG CAMPAIGN I LAUNCH THE CAMPAIGN AND JANU IN JULY SO JUNE TWENTY FOURTEEN SO I HAD A YEAR TO RUN AND I MEAN I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT WAS A WONDERFUL WONDERFUL SITUATION UP IT WAS REALLY HARD WORK
AND ADULTS TO SURVEY A SURVEY PEOPLE'S VIEWS FOR SIX MONTHS I WENT TO VISIT ALMOST EVERY TOWN CENTRE BUSINESS IN THE CONSTITUENCY WE HAD COUNTLESS LEAFLETS FACEBOOK CAMPAIGNS SOCIAL MEDIA AND WOULD'VE WANT WOOD BUT THERE'S THIS SORT OF THING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE A FUND WHERE YOU COULD HAVE HAD MORE MONEY WOULD THAT HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE I THINK THE CHALLENGES FOR INDEPENDENCE I THINK A THREE THREEFOLD REALLY FROM FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND THE FIRST THE FIRST BIG HURDLE IS GETTING AS A AS A LOCAL COUNCILLOR ALREADY I WAS KNOWN IN SOME PARTS THE CONSTITUENCY BUT FOR A LOT OF INDEPENDENCE THERE NOT AT ALL KNOWN AT ALL
AND THEN OF COURSE THE FUNDING IS A HUGE ISSUE AND WE ACTUALLY MANAGED TO RAISE FOURTEEN THOUSAND BY CROWD FUNDING BUT AS I SAID I WAS ALREADY PARTLY KNOWN ANYWAYS AND PICK MOST INDEPENDENCE HAVE TO FIND THEIR OWN CAMPAIGNS AND IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE I MEAN EVEN THE REDS I'VE HUNDRED WE SHOULD SAY YOU CAME UP AND YOU END UP COMING SECOND THAT WAS STILL SORT OF THIRTEEN THOUSAND VOTES BY I WOULD SAY THAT THE CREDIBILITY ISSUE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T
I THINK THAT INDEPENDENCE HAVE ANY HAVE ANY RIGHTS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THEY DON'T THINK OF INTO PAT'S GONNA GET ELECTED IF THEY THINK IT'S A WASTED VOTE I THINK THIS SCHEME IT DIGBY JONES RUNNING IS GOING TO COUNT ALL OF THOSE ISSUES I THINK IT'LL MAKE IT MUCH EASIER AND CRIKEY WE DO NEED A LOT MORE INDEPENDENCE I DON'T HAVE NOT JUST HOW YOU DECIDING WHO IS INDEPENDENT STILL EFFECTIVELY A COMMITTEE SAYING O.K. WE'RE GOING TO PLUMP FOR YOU TO HAVE THE MONEY OH IT'S COMING IT'S COMING FROM VOLUNTEERS AND IT'LL BE VERY LOCALISED THAT'S WHY CLAIRE ACTUALLY HER EXAMPLE IS EXCELLENT BECAUSE
WHOLE ISSUE OF THIS HAS GOT TO COME UP FROM THE BOTTOM NOT DOWN FROM THE TOP BECAUSE IT'S GOT TO BE LOCALISED THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE BECAUSE OF THE RECOGNITION ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE FINANCE ISSUES SO THIS ORIGINAL SEED CORN MONEY IS GOING TO WIN SIX HUNDRED CONSTITUENCIES GIVE TEN THOUSAND TO EACH INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE AND THEN THE REST WILL COME FROM THE CROWD FEEL FUNDING JUST LIKE CLAIRE'S DEAD
I'M SO HAPPY ORGANISATIONS LIKE CROWDS PACK AT THE MOMENT NEW WEBSITE WHICH IS DESIGNED TO DO TO DO THAT NOW HOW DO YOU CHOOSE THOSE PEOPLE IT WE'RE GOING TO ASK FOR VOLUNTEERS IN THEIR VARIOUS CONSTITUENCIES TO FORM THE SELECTION PANELS SO I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO DICTATE THAT I WOULD AND THEN WE HAD A LOT IS COMPLETELY WELL I PERSONALLY WOULDN'T HER PARTY I WOULDN'T ALLOW PARTIES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR SURE BECAUSE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY
MAJOR NATIONAL PARTY LEADER SHOULD HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THAT CEILING A BIT LIKE THAT PARTIES DO HAVE DIFFICULTIES MAKING DECISIONS AND ALSO I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTY GOVERNMENT IN BRITAIN IS GOING TO BE OVERTURNED OVERNIGHT WHAT I WOULD LIKE THOUGH IT'S JUST A JUST A SCINTILLA JUST AN ELEMENT JUST A SNIFF OF SOME DEGREE OF INDEPENDENCE ENOUGH LAW JONES CLAIRE RIGHT THANK YOU GOOD MORNING
