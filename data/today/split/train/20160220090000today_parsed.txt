SEVEN O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE TWENTIETH OF FEBRUARY GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH MICHELLE HUSSAIN AND JOHN HUMPHRYS ALBIE CAMPAIGNING WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL TO PERSUADE THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO REMAIN IN THE REFORM EUROPEAN UNION THAT WE HAVE SECURED TODAY
DAVID CAMERON HAS RETURNED TO LONDON WITH WHAT HE SAYS IS A DEAL GIVING BRITAIN'S SPECIAL STATUS IN EUROPE THE PRIME MINISTER WILL GO TO THE COMMONS ON MONDAY TO FIRE THE STARTING GUN FOR THE REFERENDUM CABINET WILL MEET THIS MORNING AFTER WHICH MINISTERS WILL BE FREE TO CAMPAIGN ON EITHER SIDE WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE
AND LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WHAT I THINK YOU WANT TO DO IS BOY CARD APPLE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY GIVE THEIR SECURITY NUMBER HOW DO YOU LIKE I JUST GOT IT BOY
DONALD TRUMP WEIGHS IN ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER APPLE SHOULD OPEN UP IT'S ENCRYPTION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND A TRIBUTE TO THE ITALIAN AUTHOR UMBERTO ECO HAS DIED AGED EIGHTY FOUR HE SHOWED HOW NOT ORALLY TO UNDERSTAND CULTURE BUT TO CREATE NEW CULTURE THAT IS WHAT THIS MAN WAS ABOUT AND NONE ON ME THAT HE LOVED IT HE ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF IT THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY HIS ABSENCE
DAVID CAMERON HAS SAID A DEAL HE HAS SECURED TO REFORM BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT AFTER MARATHON TALKS AND BRUSSELS BESTOWS SPECIAL STATUS ON THE U.K. THE PRIME MINISTER INSISTED HE HAD ACHIEVED HIS AIMS AND HE WOULD URGE VOTERS TO CHOOSE TO STAY IN THE E.U. AT THE FORTHCOMING REFERENDUM BUT THOSE IN FAVOUR OF A BRITISH EXIT WERE QUICK TO CONDEMN THE AGREEMENT SO MY ACCOUNT HAD FAILED TO DELIVER THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AS HE HAD PROMISED FROM BRUSSELS HERE'S A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS
AFTER YEARS OF TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO REFORM THE E.U. AND TWO DAYS OF TOUGH FACE TO FACE NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS SPECIFIC DEAL DAVID CAMERON GOT THE AGREEMENT HE SAID HE WANTED IN ORDER TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN TO KEEP THE U.K. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION TURNING OUR BACK ON THE E. U. IS NO SOLUTION AT ALL
WE SHOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF THOSE WHO CLAIM THAT LEAVING EUROPE IS SOME AUTOMATIC FAST TRACKED TO A LAND OF MILK AND HONEY
WE ALL NEED TO STEP BACK AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY WHAT IS BEST FOR BRITAIN WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR FUTURE CRITICS HAVE ALREADY CONDEMNED THIS DEAL AS A SHOWER AND SOME OF THE SPECIFICS FALL SHORT OF WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAD IN SPEECHES AND MANIFESTOS PREVIOUSLY PLEDGED TO ACHIEVE
BUT IF VOTERS CHOOSE TO STAY IN THE E.U. THE AGREEMENT MEANS THAT FOR UP TO SEVEN YEARS SOME BENEFITS FOR E.U. WORKERS CAN BE LIMITED DURING THEIR FIRST FOUR YEARS IN THE U.K. CHILD BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO SOME MIGRANT WORKERS WILL ALSO BE REDUCED
THERE'S AN EXPLICIT COMMITMENT THAT THE U.K. WILL NOT BE PART OF AN EVER CLOSER UNION WITH OTHER E.U. MEMBER STATES AND COUNTRIES THAT DON'T USE THE EURO WILL HAVE A SAFEGUARD MECHANISM TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT EUROZONE DECISIONS
THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT DONALD TUSK SAID NO ONE WAS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT HAPPY WITH THE DEAL BUT THAT WAS THE NATURE OF A FAIR COMPROMISE I DIPPED DEEPLY BELIEF THAT THE KING IT'S YOUR FRIEND YOU UP STAY THE NIGHT AT KING
STIRLING WOULD BE TOTALLY AGAINST OUR MUTUAL INTEREST
ALL THE COURTS LOTS TO LET THAT HAPPEN BUT THE FINO THIS IS IN THIS IN THE HANDS OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE THERE WAS RESISTANCE FROM SEVERAL COUNTRIES ON SEVERAL ISSUES BUT A DESIRE TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT BRITAIN STAYS IN THE E.U. AS THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL EXPLAINED
OF COURSE BUT I KNEW MY I YOU DON'T THINK WE'VE GOT TOO MUCH TO MY AND WE'VE HAD A HARD TIME AT SOME OF THE ISSUES BRITAIN HAS COME TO US HAS PUT ITS REQUESTS ON THE TABLE WE WERE NOT DUTY TO NEGOTIATE THEM WE DID THIS ONE TERRIBLY AND BECAUSE WE ALL OF US CONVINCED OF THE MERITS OF THE KILL
E.U. LEADERS ASSERT THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS LEGALLY BINDING ALTHOUGH PARTS OF IT WILL REQUIRE NEW LEGISLATION NEEDING THE APPROVAL OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
THIS MAY NOT BE A FUNDAMENTAL RENEGOTIATION OF THE U.K.'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. BUT IT DOES SAID BRITAIN APART FROM THE REST
DAVID CAMERON WILL HOLD A SPECIAL CABINET MEETING THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE DEAL AND SET A DATE FOR THE REFERENDUM WIDELY EXPECTED TO BE THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE HE CONFIRMED THAT HIS CLOSE FRIEND THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GAVE HAS DECIDED TO CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE E.U. OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ELEANOR GARNIER EXAMINES THE CHALLENGES FACING THE PRIME MINISTER ON HIS RETURN TO WESTMINSTER
DAVID CAMERON'S CLAIMS OF A SUCCESSFUL DEAL WILL BE HOTLY CONTESTED THERE WILL BE SENIOR PARTY FIGURES WHO WILL NOT AGREE THAT HE'S ACHIEVED A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U.
AS THE NEGOTIATION CAME TO A CLOSE IN BRUSSELS IT EMERGED THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GLOBE HAD DECIDED TO CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE E.U. HIS DECISION IS A BIG BLOW FOR THE PRIME MINISTER MY HAS BEEN A CLOSE POLITICAL ALLY OF DAVID CAMERON'S FOR YEARS AND IS A WELL RESPECTED FELLOW CONSERVATIVE MODERNISER THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THE JUSTICE SECRETARY WAS ONE OF HIS OLDEST AND CLOSEST FRIENDS WHO HAD WANTED BRITAIN TO PULL OUT FOR THIRTY YEARS
AFTER THIS MORNING'S CABINET MEETING MINISTERS WILL BE FREE TO SPEAK OUT AND CAMPAIGN ON WHICH EVER SIDE THEY LIKE AROUND SIX ARE EXPECTED TO OPPOSE MISTER CAMERON AND CALL FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THE PROMINENT EUROSCEPTIC DAVID DAVIES TOLD A RALLY OF THE GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN LAST NIGHT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR BRITAIN TO TAKE CONTROL OF ITS OWN DESTINY IT WAS JOINED BY THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL FARAGE WHO SAID THE DEAL DIDN'T TACKLE THE ISSUES BRITISH PEOPLE CARED ABOUT
IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE AS YOU THAT OUR PARLIAMENT IS NOT ABLE TO OVERALL BAD E.U. LAW IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE
WE SHOULD NOT BE PAYING FIFTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS A DAY AND IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTALIST VIEW THAT WE HAVE A TOTAL OPEN DOOR TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE
THE BUSINESSMAN RICHARD TIES HIS CO CHAIRMAN OF LEAVE DON'T EAT YOU SAID THE DAVE CAMERON DAVID CAMERON HAD PROMISED HALF A LOAF AND BEG FOR A CRUST AND BROUGHT SOME CRUMBS THE TORY M.E.P. DANIEL HANNAN WHO SUPPORTS THE VOTE LEAVE GROUP SAID BRITAIN BANGED THE TABLE AND AGGRESSIVELY DEMANDED THE STATUS QUO
BUT THE LABOUR M.P. TOOK AT MONA WAS AMONG THOSE TO TWEET HIS SUPPORT HE SAID STAYING IN THE E.U. WOULD ENSURE BRITAIN CONTINUES TO PUNCH ABOVE ITS WEIGHT AND SECURE THE NEXT GENERATION'S FUTURE AND THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. DOMINIC GRIEVE SAID THE DEAL WAS A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT
IT IS THE SINGLE WITHOUT DOUBT IT IS THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DEBATE ON THE REFERENDUM COMING UP THIS POINT SEEMS BY THE DETRACTORS THE PEOPLE WHO WANT BRECHT'S IT AND WANT TO LEAVE TO BE COMPLETELY IGNORED
DAVID CAMERON SAID THE BRITISH PEOPLE NOW FACED A ONCE IN A GENERATION MOMENTS TO SHAPE THE U.K.'S DESTINY BUT THE DEAL AND THE PUBLIC AND POLITICAL REACTION TO IT WE'RE ALSO SHAPE MISTER CAMERON'S FUTURE OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG AS THIS ASSESSMENT
THE ABILITY TO RESTRICT BENEFITS TO MIGRANTS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS ONE IS AN IMPORTANT VICTORY AMMUNITION OR HIS ARGUMENT THAT HE'S ACHIEVED CHANGES THAT COULD HELP REDUCE THE NUMBERS OF E.U. MIGRANTS COMING TO LIVE AND WORK HERE
THE PROPOSALS ARE COMPLICATED AND DO NOT MATCH EXACTLY THE PROMISES HE MADE IN THE CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO BUT WITH THOSE AND OTHER COMMITMENTS IT BECOMES HARDER FOR HIS CRITICS TO MAKE THE CASE THAT THE AGREEMENT IS FLIMSY AND WILL CHANGE NOTHING DAVID CAMERON IS NOW SET FOR A CAMPAIGN WHEN HE WILL TURN FROM ONE OF THE E. USE CRITICS TO AN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTER OF AN INSTITUTION HE'LL CLAIM IS CHANGING FOR THE BETTER
BUT HE WILL FACE REPEATEDLY A DIFFERENT QUESTION IF THE DEAL IS SO GOOD TRULY TRANSFORMATIVE WHY DO MANY OF HIS SENIOR COLLEAGUES NOT SEE ITS MERITS IN OTHER NEWS THE AUTHORITIES IN FRANCE HAVE ORDERED THE EVICTION OF MIGRANTS LIVING IN PART OF A MAKESHIFT CAMP NEAR CALAIS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN UNTIL WEDNESDAY TO LEAVE THE CAMP SOUTHERN SECTION WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE JUNGLE
THE U.K.'S MOST SENIOR PAEDIATRICIAN HAS QUESTIONED WHETHER THE N.H.S. ONE ONE ONE HELPLINE IN ENGLAND IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR DIAGNOSING ILLNESS IN YOUNG CHILDREN PROFESSOR NINA O.D.'S PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH SO SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT CALL HANDLERS WHO AREN'T MEDICALLY TRAINED CARRYING OUT ASSESSMENTS N.H.S. ENGLAND AS DEFENDED THEY'LL
THE ITALIAN AUTHOR AND PHILOSOPHER UMBERTO ECO WHOSE FIRST NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BECAME AN UNEXPECTED SUCCESS HAS DIED HE WAS EIGHTY FOUR AND HAD BEEN SUFFERING FROM CANCER
ECHO WAS VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN OUTSIDE OF THE UNIVERSITY CIRCLES UNTIL WELL INTO MIDDLE AGE THE RELEASE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY OF THE NAME OF THE ROSEN UNORTHODOX DETECTIVE STORY SET IN A MEDIEVAL MONASTERY MADE HIM AN INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITY
THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE EUROPE DEAL IS FINALLY DONE AFTER MORE THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF TALKS IN BRUSSELS THE PRIME MINISTER EMERGED LAST NIGHT TO SAY THAT THE REFORMS HE HAD NEGOTIATED WOULD GIVE THE U.K. A SPECIAL STATUS IN THE E.U. INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL TO LIMIT MIGRANTS ACCESS TO WEALTH
BRITAIN WILL BE PERMANENTLY OUT OF EVER CLOSER UNION NEVER PART OF A EUROPEAN SUPERSTATE
THERE'LL BE TOUGH NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS TO OUR WELFARE SYSTEM FOR E.U. MIGRANTS NO MORE SOMETHING FOR NOTHING
BRITAIN WILL NEVER JOIN THE EURO AND WE'VE SECURED VITAL PROTECTIONS FOR OUR ECONOMY AND THEY FULL SAY OVER THE RULES OF THE FREE TRADE SINGLE MARKET WHILE REMAINING OUTSIDE THE EURO
I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECOMMEND THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVING THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS WHILE HIS FIRST TEST IS THE CABINET MEETING THAT WILL TAKE PLACE AT TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH IS ON THE LINE FROM WESTMINSTER WHAT CHANGED NORMAN IN TERMS OF WHAT HE WANTED GOING INTO THESE TALKS IN BRUSSELS AND WHAT HE EMERGED WITH
NOT A VAST AMOUNT ACTUALLY I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME HE EMERGES WITH SOME WINS SOME LOSSES AND SOME SCORE DRAWS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LOSS IT SEEMS TO ME HE'S ON CHILD BENEFIT AGAIN HE'S ALREADY HAD TO CONCEDE INDEX LINKING CHILD BENEFIT FOR MIGRANTS WHOSE CHILDREN LIVE ABROAD BUT LAST NIGHT HE HAD TO MAKE A FURTHER CONCESSION WHICH IS FOR EXISTING
MIGRANTS WHO ALREADY GET IT IN THE U.K. THAT WON'T KICK IN THE INDEX LINKING WON'T KICK IN FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS SO THAT IS A LOSS ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE HE GOT SEVEN YEARS NOT THE THIRTEEN YEARS HE WAS ARGUING FOR BUT I DON'T BELIEVE ANY BRITISH DIPLOMAT SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THEY WERE GOING TO GET THIRTEEN YEARS I THINK THAT WAS A NEGOTIATING PLOY
IN TERMS OF EVER CLOSER UNION YES HE HAS GOT AN OPT OUT WRITTEN INTO A FUTURE TREATY THAT BRITAIN WILL NOT BE PART OF THE POLITICAL INTEGRATION AND IN TERMS OF SAFEGUARDS FOR NON EURO COUNTRIES LIKE BRITAIN
HE'S GOT HE'S GOT WHAT HE CALLS AN EMERGENCY SAVE GOTTEN A SLIGHTLY MORE AMBIGUOUS AS FAR AS I CAN UNDERSTAND IT MEANS WE CAN RAISE A CONCERN AT A EUROPEAN COUNCIL MEETING BUT IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR TO ME THAT WE CAN DO MUCH TO STOP A NEW E.U. BANKING REGULATION BEYOND RAISING OUR CONCERNS AND I IMAGINE THERE'LL STILL BE SOME APPREHENSION IN THE CITY ABOUT THAT AND LASTLY HE DID SUGGEST THAT THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE ROAD THAT IF WE WANT TO PRESS WERE FURTHER REFORMS WE CAN PRESS FOR FURTHER REFORMS ALTHOUGH I IMAGINE
EITHER MISTER CAMERON OR ANY OTHER E.U. LEADERS WILL BE PARTICULARLY THRILLED ABOUT THE IDEA OF GOING THROUGH ANOTHER SORT OF E.U. REFORM PACKAGE ANY TIME SOON SO HE IS RECOMMENDING THIS DEAL OF AD AT THE CABINET MEETING TODAY AT IT DOES LOOK AS THOUGH HE'S GOING TO NOT BE ABLE TO CONVINCE SOME OF THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM
KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS HE WILL SET OUT WHY HE THINKS IT'S A GOOD DEAL THEN HE WILL ASK FOR INTERVENTIONS FROM AROUND THE CABINET TABLE AT WHICH AROUND HALF A DOZEN OR SO ARE EXPECTED SAY NO THEY CAN'T SUPPORT HIM AMONG THE NAMES WE BROADLY ALREADY KNOW MICHAEL GO OF CHRIS GRAYLING THERESA VILLIERS IAIN DUNCAN SMITH MISTER CAMERON WILL THEN COME OUT INTO DOWNING STREET IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THE DATE JUNE TWENTY THREE IN ALL PROBABILITY SET OUT HIS BIG ARGUMENTS
FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. AND THEN THAT WILL BE PRETTY MUCH ALL WE HEAR FROM MISTER CAMERON TODAY MEANWHILE ABOUT ONE OR TWO I THINK OF THE CABINET MEMBERS WHO WANT TO LEAVE ARE LIKELY TO TAKE TO THE AIRWAYS TODAY AND SET OUT THEIR CONCERNS AND THEN
TOMORROW I THINK ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT FINALISED MY CAMERON WILL SET OUT HIS SOVEREIGNTY PACKAGE NOW THAT IS CRITICAL BECAUSE ON THAT HINGE IS THE DECISION OF ONE BORIS JOHNSON HE WILL NOT MAKE HIS VIEWS CLEAR I UNDERSTAND UNTIL HE'S SEEN WHAT MISTER CAMERON IS GOING TO DO IN TERMS OF BEEFING UP PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY AND THAT SEEMS TO ME THE REAL WILD CARD IN THIS REFERENCE HOW DAMAGING IS IT TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S AUTHORITY THAT THOSE HALF A DOZEN OR SO YOU MENTIONED THE CABINET WON'T EVEN BE WAITING TO SEE WHAT'S IN THAT POT
WELL TO BE FAIR I THINK THEY HAD PROBABLY ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MIND BEFORE MISTER CAMERON EVEN WENT TO GET A DEAL I THINK PEOPLE'S VIEWS ON EUROPE STRETCHED WAY BEYOND CHILD BENEFIT AND MET AND ARRANGEMENTS AROUND HIM AT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE THE ONE
PERSON WHO WILL WHO'S CRITICISM WILL CONCERN THE PRIME MINSTER IS OBVIOUSLY MICHAEL GO WHY NOT JUST BECAUSE HE'S A PERSONAL FRIEND BUT BECAUSE HE HAS LEGITIMACY HE HAS CREDIBILITY HE'S A SERIOUS THINKER HE'S NOT A DYED IN THE WOOL
EURO PHOTO SO HE IS A HUGE BOOST TO THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IS WHETHER HIS DECISION PROMPTS BORIS JOHNSON TO FOLLOW HIM BECAUSE IF YOU THINK
IT SEEMS TO BE THE KEY ADVANTAGE THOSE WHO WANT TO STAY IN THAT YOU HAVE IS THE PRIME MINISTER WHAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN LACK IS A COUNTERPOINTS THAT BORIS JOHNSON COULD BE THAT COUNTERPOINT SO HIS DECISION
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL LET'S TURN BACK NOW TO THE VIEW FROM EUROPE ON HOW THIS IS BEING RECEIVED WHAT MISTER CAMERON ACHIEVED WE'RE JOINED BY THE GERMAN M.E.P. REBECCA HARMS HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE GREENS EUROPEAN FREE LINES IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MONEY ANGELA MERKEL SAID YESTERDAY THAT SHE THINKS IT IS THIS IS A FAIR COMPROMISE THAT DAVID CAMERON HAS STRUCK DO YOU AGREE WITH HER
I THINK WHAT ALL EUROPEANS KENDRA AND IN THIS VERY MOMENT IS THAT IMPRESSIVE IT'S WE ARE NOT SITTING IN THE CAPITAL OF A SUPER STATE
A BRASS SUITS IS THE PLACE IN EUROPE FOR NEGOTIATIONS AND COMPROMISE
AND THIS HAPPENED AGAIN FOR THEIR NEGOTIATIONS IN BETWEEN DON'T KNOW TUSK AND MISTER CAMERON NOW FINALISED IN THE EUROPEAN CONCERT THE REASON I ASKED YOU WHETHER YOU THINK IT IS A FAIR COMPROMISE IS A BECAUSE SOME IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSED LIMITATIONS TO MIGRANTS ACCESS TO WEALTH AND WHETHER THAT AMOUNTS TO DISCRIMINATION SO DO YOU THINK THIS IS A FAIR COMPROMISE BETWEEN WHAT MISTER CAMERON WANTED AND THOSE SORTS OF CONCERN
I THINK SO AS ALSO VESICULAR AT OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE CURRENT LUNCHES YES THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AGREED
I THINK THEY THEY REALLY HAVE BEEN TOUCHED HER CAREFULLY I WAS IN THE BOOT GIVING VERY CONCERNED SO I MYSELF GROWTH FROM A WORKING CLASS FAMILY AND FOR ME IT IS THE PRINCIPLE THAT YOU ARE CHIEF IN DOING YOUR JOB FOR THE SAME DUTIES THE SAME RIGHT IF IS A CRUCIAL PRINCIPLE SO THE ACTIVATION POTENTIALLY OFFER SEVEN YEAR LIMITATION ON ON MIGRANTS ACCESS TO WELFARE IS IS FOR YOU FAIR
I REMEMBER THAT ALL SAW THE GERMANS KEPT CLAW ST THERE ARE LABOUR MARKET WHEN WE HIT FREE MOVEMENT FOR FOUR WORKERS THEN THEY'RE GERMANS ALSO KEPT THEIR MARKET WORK MARKET CLOSED FOR SEVEN YEARS OR FOUR FIGHTS YES I'M NOT SURE BUT SO YES I CAN AGREE WITH THIS COMPROMISED REBECCA HARMS ANY P. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST SENIOR PAEDIATRICIAN HAS WARNED THAT THE N.H.S. ONE ONE ONE LINE MIGHT NOT BE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE AT DIAGNOSING ILLNESSES IN YOUNG CHILDREN SHE IS PROFESSOR IMODIUM SHE SHE'S PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOT SAFE BECAUSE
NO IF I MIGHT REPHRASE WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID MY HUMPHREYS WHAT I SAID WAS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE EVALUATE OUR N.H.S. WHEN WHEN ONE SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT ALL OF THE REPORTS THAT I'VE SEEN SUGGESTS THAT THE CALL HANDLERS ARE ACTING VERY APPROPRIATELY IN THE WAY IN WHICH THEY RECEIVE CALLS AND TRIAGE THEM BUT WHAT WE DON'T KNOW OF COURSE BECAUSE THE RESEARCH HASN'T BEEN DONE IS HOW SENSITIVE THE ALGORITHMS AND THE GUIDANCE THAT THEY USE IS
IN ACTUALLY ACCURATELY DETECTING SICK CHILDREN SO THE FIRST POINTS THAT I WAS ATTEMPTING TO MAKE WAS THAT WE DO NEED TO EVALUATE THE SERVICES THAT WE DELIVER IN HEALTH CARE I SUPPOSE MOST PEOPLE LISTENING TO THAT WOULD SAY
I'M NOT SURE WHEN MY CHILD IS SICK AND I'M DESPERATELY WORRIED ABOUT HER WHETHER I WANT TO TALK TO AN ALGORITHM HAS IT WORK BUT I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS AND YOU KNOW XANDER'S HAD EXPERIENCE SO I MEAN THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT PARENTS DO NEED TO BE REASSURED THAT WHEN THEY SEEK ADVICE WHETHER IT'S FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY THINK MIGHT BE REALLY SERIOUS OR WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS LESS SERIOUS BUT FOR WHICH NONETHELESS THEY'RE SEEKING ADVICE
THAT THEY GET TO THE RIGHT PERSON AND AT THE MOMENT IF THEY RING UP N. H. S. ONE ONE ONE AS I SAID EARLIER ALL THE REPORTS THAT I'VE SEEN SUGGESTS THAT N. H. S. ONE ONE ONE IS DOING A VERY GOOD JOB
TRIAGING THE PATENT AND THIS INCLUDES CHILDREN VERY EFFECTIVELY BUT OF COURSE THERE IS THERE IS A REAL ISSUE HERE PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN AND THAT IS THAT IT IS
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO RECOGNISE A SICK CHILD THE YOUNGER THE CHILD IS SO THE BABIES UM IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO RECOGNISE SERIOUS ILLNESS IN THAN IT IS IN IN ADULTS SO WHAT IS SO DOWN ABOUT THAT SO WE NEED WE NEED AS AS ALWAYS GOOD JOINING UP SO WE NEED A TRIAGE SYSTEM THAT IS EFFECTIVE WITH THEN NEED THE TRIAGE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO DIRECT
THE PATIENT THE CHILD THE BABY IN THIS INSTANCE TWO AND EFFECTIVE NEXT NEXT PORT OF CALL BECAUSE REMEMBER TRIGGER BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT A DIAGNOSTIC SERVICE IT'S A TRIAGE SERVICE YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ANYTHING YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION LET'S SAY THEY SEND YOU IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GENERAL THE GENERAL PRACTICE WILL THEN PARENTS NEED TO HAVE THE REASSURANCE TO KNOW THAT THE GENERAL PRACTITIONER
HE'S COMPETENT TO DEAL WITH CHILDREN AND HAS HAD EXPERIENCE HAS HAD TRAINING IN DEALING WITH CHILDREN AND HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM IN THE U.K. BECAUSE OF COURSE ONLY ONE IN THREE OF OUR GENERAL PRACTITIONERS HAS HAD ANY POST GRADUATE TRAINING IN PAEDIATRIC PRACTICE AND THAT'S WHY THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH IS REALLY SUPPORTING
GENERAL PRACTICE COLLEAGUES IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO EXTEND THEIR TRAINING PROGRAMMES SO THAT THEY CAN ALL RECEIVED TRAINING IN PAEDIATRICS IN REALITY A FINAL QUICK THOUGHT IF I MAY IF YOUR CHILD WAS SICK AND YOU WERE REALLY REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HER YOU PUT HER IN A CAR AND
DRIVE OFF TO THE NEAREST ANY WOULDN'T YOU IN WELL AGAIN IN THE REAL WORLD AGAIN IN THEM YOU'VE PUT YOUR FINGER ON SOMETHING PARENTS NEED TO BE HELPED AND PARENTS ARE USUALLY PRETTY GOOD AT KNOWING WHEN SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THAT WITH THEIR CHILD NONE THE LESS THEY CAN THEY CAN BE GIVEN MORE HELP SO FOR EXAMPLE DETECTING SIGNS OF SEPSIS OR MENINGITIS A REALLY SERIOUS ILLNESSES AND YOU'RE RIGHT IF YOU'RE REALLY REALLY REALLY WORRIED THEN YOU NEED TO GET YOU NEED TO GET TO ANY STRETCH STRAIGHT AWAY BUT IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE TALK TO N.H.S. ONE ONE ONE TALK TO YOUR FAMILY DOCTOR
IF YOU CAN GET HOLD OF YOUR FAMILY DOCTOR PROFESSOR MODI THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME IS TWENTY PAST SEVEN THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE PASSES THROUGH SOUTH CAROLINA TODAY WITH HER LATEST REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AS BEING HELD DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN LEADING IN THE POLLS BUT TED CRUISE HAS BEEN CLOSING IN VICTORY AND SOUTH CAROLINA WOULD GIVE HIM A BIG BOOST IN OTHER STATES VOTING IN THE COMING WEEKS GEORGIA ALABAMA TEXAS AND HIS MESSAGE SEEMS TO BE RESONATING IN THE CONSERVATIVE SOUTH OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT REPORTS
O.K. MORE THAN WELCOME I'LL MAKE JENKINS ALSO TELL ME WORK SOUTH AT THE TOP THIS COUNTRY HAM HOUSE THEY SERVE UP THE MENU OF THE AMERICAN SOUTH GRITS HOT BREAKFAST BISCUITS
HOMEMADE HE CAMP ENJOY THAT O.K. DONALD TRUMP WAS HERE A FEW DAYS AGO AND FOUND A WELCOMING CLIENTELE PLEA FOR PEACE FROM CHILDHOOD REALLY CARED FLOWER PIECES REALLY LABOUR MANY SOUTH CAROL LENIENCE HAVE TAKEN THIS PILLION A YANKEE
BUT THERE'S A LONG HISTORY IN THE SOUTH OF BACKING ANTI ESTABLISHMENT POPULISTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEIR RHETORIC COMES WITH A RACIAL EDGE
HIS HARD LINE STANCE AND IMMIGRATION RESONATES WHETHER IT'S THE WALL ON THE MEXICAN BORDER OR THE TEMPORARY MUSLIMS BUT THIS WAY YOU GET A LEAK IN YOUR HOUSE AND WE OUGHTA RUN IT DOWN STAY WHAT DO YOU LIKE YOGHURT WATER
FATHERLY IT MAKES ME WANNA GO OUT THERE AND SMACK THEM GARMENT IN THE HAY AND DOWN LOOK YOU'VE DONE MORE FOR THE STRANGER COMING IN LIKE A TRAIN IF SOME MY SNAKE IN YOUR HOUSE AND STEALING YOUR FOOD A LITTLE BIT AND MAKES YOU MAY
ARE YOU GOING IN A STATE WHERE THE FIRST SHOTS OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR RANG OUT CONFEDERATE HERITAGE SHOT STILL THEY WERE DECENT TRAY I'LL CALL THE MODIFIED CONFEDERATE FLAG BECAUSE OF THE CONFEDERATE FLAG SO ONE AMONGST SUPPORTERS OF DONALD TRUMP THERE'S A NOSTALGIA STILL FOR DIXIE POLL SUGGESTS THAT SEVENTY PER CENT OF HIS SUPPORTERS THINK THE CONFEDERATE FLAG SHOULD STILL BE FLYING OVER THE STATE CAPITOL ALMOST FORTY PER CENT WISH THE SOUTH THAT WON THE CIVIL WAR
HE BENEFITS FROM THAT AGE OLD SOUTHERN MISTRUST OF WASHINGTON MOST SOUTHERNERS FORGOTTEN THERE WAS A WAR WE STILL FELT INDEPENDENT WE WANT TO RETAIN HER INDEPENDENCE OF THE STAGE
MONICA THAN THEIR NOSE WASH THAT AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S ABLE TO DO US PROUD I WILL HALT THE GIVEAWAY
YOU'RE AMERICAN BALLADS AND PRODUCTS I OLD NATIONS THAT AID OUR ENEMIES DOUBLE TRAP FREAKED WHEN HE COMPARED TO THE SOUTHERN POLITICIAN GEORGE WALLACE THE SEGREGATIONIST DEMAGOGUE WHO DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES EXPLOITED WHITE FEARS ABOUT THE SPEED OF BLACK ADVANCE WALLAHS
GIVE HIM YOUR SUPPORT WALLIS'S BIOGRAPHER DAN CARTER SEES CLEAR PARALLELS BETWEEN THE TWO IN THE CASE OF CROP HE SENSED THIS SHOWING RAGE
AGAINST THE OTHER IN THIS CASE MUSLIM AMERICANS AND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES ALL OF THOSE THINGS MAKE
MANY OF HIS FOLLOWERS AND MANY MANY REPUBLICANS WHAT TO RETURN TO NINETEEN FIFTY THREE BEFORE ALL THESE POLITICAL MOVEMENTS EXPLODED IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES ARE KIND OF NICE PEACEFUL AMERICA IN QUITE AMERICA AND THAT AMERICA'S GONE
TRUE WHAT THE DIXI IT'S EASY TO CARICATURE SOUTH CAROLINA AS A BASTION OF CONFEDERATE HERITAGE
THE STATES REPUBLICAN PARTY PRESENTS A FAR MORE INCLUSIVE FACE THE GOVERNOR IS FEMALE AND INDIAN AMERICAN IT CAN ALSO BOASTS THE ONLY BLACK REPUBLICAN IN THE U.S. SENATE
FOR MANY IN THE G.O.P. HIERARCHY LIKE RANDY PAGE TRUMP FEELS LIKE A THROWBACK OBVIOUSLY A DON'T TRIUMPH WAS THE A FISH THE PARTY WOULD DRAMATICALLY CHANGE WHAT THE PARTY
DO YOU KNOW AS A CONSERVATIVE EVANGELICAL REPUBLICAN
MY HOPE IS THAT WE DON'T GO THERE BECAUSE I DO THINK
THAT FACE REALLY PLAYS TO THE FEARS THAT WE HAVE BALLOON THE HOPES THAT WE CAN MOVE IN
NICK BRYANT REPORTING THE TIME IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN AMERICAN AIR STRIKES TARGETING SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IN LIBYA YESTERDAY ARE REPORTED TO HAVE KILLED A TUNISIAN EXTREMIST LINK TO THE ATTACK THAT KILLED THIRTY BRITISH TOURISTS IN SEUSS LAST YEAR I S. IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE SIX THOUSAND FIGHTERS IN LIBYA FIVE YEARS AFTER WESTERN AIR STRIKES AGAINST COLONEL GADDAFI'S REGIME BEGAN P.J. CROWLEY WAS THE STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN IN THE RUN UP TO THAT INTERVENTION I ASKED HIM WHETHER THESE STRIKES WERE PART OF A BIGGER PLAN FOR LIBYA
I THINK THEY'RE PART OF THE GLOBAL PLAN FOR THE UNITED STATES IN FIGHTING TERRORISM THESE KINDS OF STRIKES HAVE BEEN DONE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT THE IDEA OF IDENTIFYING BAD GUYS AND TAKING THEM OUT THE BATTLEFIELD IS SOMETHING THAT I'D SAY SHE'D BEEN COMMITTED TO FOR SOME TIME YOU WERE IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT UNTIL
JUST BEFORE THE ORIGINAL AIR STRIKES AGAINST PRESIDENT GADDAFI'S TANKS WHAT WAS THE THINKING AT THAT TIME WAS IT SEEN AS A AS A SIMPLE OPERATION TO SUPPORT THOSE IN THE UPRISING AGAINST GADDAFI I DON'T THINK HE WAS SEEN AS A SIMPLE OPERATION BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU HAD A REBEL MOVEMENT IN THE EAST OF LIBYA IN IT PRESENTED HERSELF AS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE YOUR CHEW THE GOVERNMENT OF MORE MARKER DARCY
AND THEY OVERTHREW HIM OBVIOUSLY WITH THE SUPPORT OF NATO WENT COULD BARFI FELL THERE WAS NO FOUNDATION FOR THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT IN LIBYA TO BEGIN TO BUILD A FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY AND OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN LIBYA DESCEND INTO CHAOS BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE COMPETING FACTIONS
WHAT YOU HAVE TODAY YES YOU HAVE CHOUX COMPETING GOVERNMENT AND THAT MIRROR SAY FOG WIND THAT DOES EXIST IN IN LIBYA RIVALRIES BETWEEN EAST AND WEST AT THE POINT THAT YOU IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT EVALUATED THE RISKS OF INTERVENTION IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN GIVEN THE FACT THAT THAT YOU KNEW HOW ALL ENCOMPASSING THE REGIME OF GADDAFI WAS DID YOU WEIGH UP
THE CHANCES OF THE COUNTRY DISINTEGRATING AND INTO THIS SORT OF LAWLESSNESS THERE WAS DISCUSSION WITH THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT IN LIBYA TRUE THE UNITED NATIONS AND WITH VARIOUS PARTNERS INCLUDING SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THE LIBYANS OVERESTIMATED WHAT THEY THEMSELVES COULD DO GIVEN A COLONIAL PAST IN LIBYA THEY WERE VERY RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT DEMONSTRATIVE INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE ON THE GROUND I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID AND I THINK OTHERS HAVE RECOGNISED
IN RETROSPECT YOU NATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE DO YOU REGRET THE ORIGINAL INTERVENTION GIVEN WHAT WE SEE NOW IN THE RISE OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE ACROSS THE REGION IN FAIRNESS THIS WASN'T NECESSARILY AN IDEA THAT ORIGINATED IN WASHINGTON IN FACT ORIGINATED
IN EUROPEAN CAPITALS AND YOUR REMEMBER THE RESTORATION TOOK THE LEAD FOR A WHILE AND THEN TURN THIS OVER TO NATO IN OF COURSE IN THE STATES WAS RELUCTANT TO PUT HER BOOTS ON THE GROUND GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ AND THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS CONSUMED BY ITS OWN CHALLENGERS LIBYA ONE OUT ON WAY AND WE NOW SEE THERE IS A CHAOTIC SITUATION AND IN THAT CHAOS WERE SEEING
THE RISE OF AN ELEMENT OF THE ISLAMIC STATE MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND FIGHTERS AT SOME POINT THE WORK WE HAVE TO READ THIS IT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT BUT THEN AGAIN LIBYA STILL A FRENCH COUNTRY THIS RELATIVELY SMALL POPULATION THERE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT IS DRIVING THE MAYHEM IN THE MIDDLE EAST TODAY IT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST SYRIA WHEN YOU SAY REVISIT WHAT WE CAN DO DO YOU MEAN THAT
EVEN THOUGH IT IS A FRENCH COUNTRY AS YOU SAY MORE THAN AIR STRIKES MAY HAVE TO BE DONE TO STABILISE IT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF THAT GROUP IS FIRST AND FOREMOST
TO DEFEAT THE CALA FATE IAN ROCKER IN SYRIA AND HELP THEIR IRAQIS RECOVER LAST TERRITORY PARTICULARLY THE MAJOR CITY OF MORSEL PETER CROWLEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH

ONE ONE ONE HELPLINE IN ENGLAND IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR DIAGNOSING ILLNESS IN YOUNG CHILDREN THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH PROFESSOR NINA MODI SO SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT CALL HANDLERS WHO AREN'T MEDICALLY TRAINED CARRYING OUT ASSESSMENTS N.H.S. ENGLAND HAS DEFENDED THE HELPLINE
ITALIAN AUTHOR AND PHILOSOPHER UMBERTO ECO'S FIRST NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BECAME AN UNEXPECTED SUCCESS HAS DIED HE WAS EIGHTY FOUR IT WAS VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN OUTSIDE OF UNIVERSITY CIRCLES UNTIL THE RELEASE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY OF THE NAME OF THE ROSE THE UNORTHODOX DETECTIVE STORY SET IN A MEDIEVAL MONASTERY MADE HIM AN INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITY
TWENTY FIVE TO EIGHT DAVID CAMERON SAYS THE REFORMS HE HAS SECURED IN BRUSSELS JUSTIFY BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OTHERS DISAGREE SIR BILL CASH THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. WHO CHAIRS THE COMMONS EUROPEAN SECURE SCRUTINY COMMITTEE SAID THE DEAL FAILED TO ADDRESS THE REAL QUESTION OF WHO GOVERNED BRITAIN
WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT SOME REFORMS A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN WHITTLED RIGHT DOWN ALMOST TO ZERO INTO A PUFF OF SMOKE BUT ACTUALLY NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE RELATIONSHIP WHATSOEVER SOPPING EVER CLOSER UNION FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM IT WON'T CHANGE ONE SINGLE LAW AND ONE SINGLE TREE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN PASSED IT'S ONLY FOR THE FUTURE IF IT EVEN TAKES EFFECT AND IT MIGHT EVEN GET CHALLENGED IN THE COURT
AND WHAT DOES THE LABOUR PARTY SINGLE I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY THE SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY HILARY BENN MORNING MISTER BEN GOOD MORNING JOHN DID MY CAMERON DO A GOOD JOB
WE'RE NOT HE'S DONE WHAT HE DECIDED HE HAD TO DO BECAUSE HE WAS TOO WEAK TO STAND UP TO HIS POLITICAL PARTY THE TORY PARTY AS WE KNOW WE JUST HAD BUILT CACHES VIEWER IS BITTERLY DIVIDED PARTY LET THE QUESTION WAS DID HE DO A GOOD JOB WELL A PARTY'S NOT DIVIDE YOU FRANK FIELD WITH WITH GREAT RESPECT WELL THERE'S A VERY SMALL OR VERY SMALL NUMBER
OF LABOUR M.P.S WHO DON'T SUPPORT OUR CAN SHE LENDS A MUCKY BOOK WELL BUT JOHN THE VAST MAJORITY OF LABOUR M.P.S THE LABOUR MOVEMENT AND THE LABOUR PARTY CONFERENCE THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT SUPPORTS OUR CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP WHY BECAUSE BEING IN THE E.U. JOHN HAS GIVEN US JOBS INVESTMENT GROWTH
IT'S GIVES HER SECURITY AND A SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR ME IT GIVES US INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD AND WHY WOULD WE WANT TO EXCHANGE ALL OF THAT FOR A LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN THE DIVISION IT LOOK YOU'RE A STUDENT OF HISTORY JOHN THIS IS A COMPLETE MIRROR IMAGE OF FORTY YEARS AGO THEN YOU WOULD'VE BEEN RIGHT TO SAY THE LABOUR PARTY WAS DIVIDED BECAUSE WE WERE IN FACT THE MAJORITY OF LABOUR
AT THE LABOUR MOVEMENT THEIR LABOUR COMFORT WAS OPPOSED TO OUR MEMBERSHIP AND THE TORIES WERE UNITED IT'S A MIRROR IMAGE NOW FORTY ONE YEARS LATER WE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN OUR SUPPORT FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THAT WAS REGARDLESS OF WHAT CAME OUT OF THIS RENEGOTIATION AND WE WILL NOW TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE REAL CRUSH ON THE BALLOT PAPER WHICH IS NOT DO YOU SUPPORT THE DEAL OR NOT
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE YES BUT CRUCIAL TO THAT IS GOING TO BE WHETHER PEOPLE THINK WE ARE IN EFFECTIVELY A NEW OR DIFFERENT EUROPE DO YOU THINK WHAT MISTER CAMERON HAS ACHIEVED IN BRUSSELS GIVES US THAT
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT HE HAS NEGOTIATED WITH THAT WE WERE CALLING FOR FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR MANIFESTO WE SAID WE WANTED A RED CARD AND WE'VE GOT THAT AND OF COURSE THAT IS A GOOD THING WE ARGUED AT THE ELECTION THAT THERE SHOULD BE PROTECTION FOR THE POUND BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PART OF THE EURO AND BUT BUT PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED AND WE ARE LOCKED INTO THIS THING THAT WE HAVE NO INFLUENCE IN
AGAIN DON'T UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY WE ARE NOT IN THE EURO BECAUSE THE LAST LABOUR GOVERNMENT DECIDED QUITE RIGHTLY THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO JOIN WE'RE NOT PART OF THE SHINGEN AGREEMENT WE OPTED OUT OF THE NUMBER OF JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS MEASURES BUT WE ARE PART OF THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT AND WHEN I SAY WE'RE SAFER COS WE'RE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS YOU KNOW JOHN IT MEANS NOW THAT IF SOMEONE COMMITS A CRIME HERE IN THE OLD DAYS THEY COULD FLEE TO ANOTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRY AND HOPE THAT LENGTHY LEGAL PROCESS IS
WOULD EVER PREVENT THEM FROM HAVING TO RETURN TO FACE JUSTICE IN BRITAIN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ANY MORE AND ONE OF THE FAILED OUR BOMBERS IN THE TWENTY FIRST OF JULY BOMB PLOT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WAS EXTRADITED BACK TO BRITAIN TO FACE JUSTICE
BECAUSE OF THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT NOW THEY'VE THE REFERENDUM IS GOING TO BE ABOUT WHETHER IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND BECAUSE IT HAS BROUGHT US ALL OF THESE THINGS AND BECAUSE THOSE WHO ARE CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE JOHN ARE COMPLETELY UNABLE TO TELL US WHAT OUT HE'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE THEY SAY WELL WE CAN NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS IF IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE NORWAY NORWAY PAYS INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION IT HAS TO ACCEPT MOST OF IT HAS TO ACCEPT FREE MOVEMENT
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO SAY OVER HOW DECISIONS ARE TAKEN SO WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SWAP WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH ARE GOOD TRADE DEALS
FOR THE PROMISE THAT WE MIGHT REPLICATE THEM BUT WE MIGHT NOT WELL THAT'S JUST LOOKING AROUND THE WORLD JOHN IT SLIGHTLY UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES SLOW DOWN IN CHINA BEING PART OF THIS HUGE MARKET THAT HAS ENCOURAGED COMPANIES TO COME AND INVEST IN BRITAIN PRECISELY BECAUSE WE HAVE X. AS THOSE LITTLE MARKET IS IN OUR INTEREST AS THOSE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO PERSUADE YOUR
MEMBERS OF BECAUSE MOST OF THEM YOUR SUPPORTERS MOST OF THOSE WHEN YOU GET TO THE POLE THEY ASK PEOPLE HOW THEY PLAN TO VOTE AT THE REFERENDUM AND THOSE WHO VOTED LABOUR LAST MAY
ARE DECISIVELY IN FAVOUR OF PULLING OUT SO YOU DO HAVE A PROBLEM DON'T YOU
THIS IS A BIG AND IMPORTANT DECISION EVERYONE OF US IS GOING TO HAVE ONE VOTE
BUT IT COULDN'T MATTER MORE THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION WE'LL HAVE TAKEN FOR JUST OVER FORTY YEARS AND NOT JUST ABOUT OUR PLACE IN EUROPE BUT A PLACE IN THE WORLD AND I BELIEVE IN THE END PEOPLE WILL SEE THE ARGUMENT FOR ALL THE FRUSTRATIONS EUROPE IS NOT PERFECT EUROPE CONTINUES TO NEED REFORM
BUT WHEN YOU COME TO MAKE A CHOICE ARE WE GOING TO PUT AT RISK
THE JOBS THE INVESTMENT THE GROWTH OR BUSINESSES THAT HAVE COME AND LOCATED HERE THE ABILITY TO MOVE TO OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO WORK BECAUSE IT'S A TWO WAY FLOW OF PEOPLE
I'VE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES WHEN I WAS A MINISTER AT THE FACT THAT EUROPE HAD A SINGLE VIEW ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH WE TOOK TO THE BARLEY NEGOTIATIONS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHY LEAD THE U.K. DELEGATION THAT WAS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL NEGOTIATING DEBT RELIEF FOR THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD JUST TO MY ARGUMENT JOHN IS THAT OUR VOICE IN EUROPE IS IN THE IN THE WORLD IS STRENGTHENED BY BEING PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IT IS NOT WEAKENED AND THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL ARGUMENT FOR STAYING AND HILARY BENN MANY THANKS
THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AS CAMPAIGNING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EUROPE ARGUMENT BEGINS IN EARNEST WE WILL SEE NEW ALLIANCES AND DIVISIONS AND AT OF ANTI E.U. RALLY IN WESTMINSTER LAST NIGHT THE APPEARANCE OF THE FORMER LABOUR AND RESPECT PARTY M.P. GEORGE GALLOWAY SPARKED A WALKOUT BY SOME OF THOSE PRESENT WHEN HE WAS INTRODUCED BY NIGEL FARAGE THE TELEGRAPH SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT KATE MCCANN WAS THERE GOOD MORNING MORNING WHAT DID YOU SEE
WELL IT WAS IT WAS QUITE A SCENE LAST NIGHT IT WAS THE LAUNCH OF THE GRASS ROOTS OUT CAMPAIGN IN LONDON LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE PACKED INTO A HALL IN LONDON ALMOST TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE IN FACT AND THEY HAD BEEN PROMISED A SPECIAL GUEST SO LOTS OF PEOPLE EXPECTING A CABINET MINISTER TO COME OUT FOR THE LEAF CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THAT TO LEAD THE GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN AND IN FACT AFTER ALMOST TWO AND A HALF HOURS IT TURNED OUT THAT GEORGE GALLOWAY WAS THE SPECIAL GUEST AND LOTS OF PEOPLE LEFT I HAVE SO PROBABLY
IF NOT TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT PEOPLE WALKED OUT WHAT THE IMMEDIATELY AS HIS NAME WAS ANNOUNCED ALL BASED ON SOMETHING HE SAID SO NIGEL FARRAJ INTRODUCED GEORGE GALLOWAY ON STAGE IN A SOON AS HIS NAME WAS READ OUT IN HE STARTED TO MAKE HIS WAY TO THE STAGE ONE MAN AT THE BACK HAD TO BE BUNDLED OUT BY SECURITY BECAUSE HE WAS MAKING A REALLY LOUD PROTESTS AGAINST GEORGE GALLOWAY AND AFTER THAT LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE STARTED TO WALK OUT LOTS OF PEOPLE SAYING IT'S A DISGRACE IT'S DISGUSTING
ONE COUPLE ON THE WAY OUT THAT I SPOKE TO SAID THAT THEY FELT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH GEORGE GALLOWAY AT ALL ON ANY LEVEL BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF HIS VIEWS ON WHAT BECAUSE HE'S GOT VERY STRONG VIEWS ARE LOTS OF THINGS BUT ONE MAN THE MAN SHOUTING AT THE BACK WAS WHERE COMPLAINING ABOUT THOSE CALORIES ANTI SEMITIC VIEWS AND I THINK THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT STRONGLY FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE LEAVING LAST NIGHT THEY FELT THAT THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH GEORGE GALLOWAY'S REPUTATION ON THAT FRONT
WHAT WAS THE EFFECT ON THE REST OF OF THE GATHERING DID HE DID HE CARRY ON HOW DID THE REST OF THE SPEAKER'S HANDLE IT HE CARRIED ON AND THE REST OF THE AUDIENCE WHO REMAINED IN THE HALL GAVE HIM RELATIVELY WARM RECEPTION BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE QUITE CONFUSED BY HIS APPEARING TO US HE'S NOT ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE
AT A RALLY LIKE THAT IN FACT ONE UKIP SPOKESMAN SAID TO ME AFTERWARDS THEY THOUGHT THAT HAVING GEORGE GALLERY ONBOARD MAKE THEIR CAMP CAMPAIGN UNBEATABLE BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE A BROADER POLITICAL SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN FACT ACTUALLY I THINK WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT PUTS PEOPLE OFF BECAUSE GEORGE CALORIES VIEWS ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS ARE VERY EXTREME
KATE MCCANN OF THE TELEGRAPH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND LAST NIGHT'S EUROPEAN UNION IS OF COURSE THE BIG STORY SEVERAL PAPERS CRITICAL OF THE REFORM SECURED BY THE PRIME MINISTER UNDER THE HEADLINE CALL THAT A DEAL DAVE THE MAIL SAYS MISTER CAMERON WAS FORCED TO WATER DOWN KEY DEMANDS THE EXPRESS SINCE THE SETTLEMENT WAS NO GOOD
CREATIVE CONDEMNING MISTER CAMERON'S GAMBLE IS NOT WORTH THE PAPER IT WAS WRITTEN ON IT SAYS THE TIMES REPORTS THAT DIPLOMATS FROM AN ALLIANCE OF EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BRANDED THE PRIME MINISTER AS ARROGANT FOR BELIEVING THAT HIS DEMANDS FOR REFORM WOULD BE MET SOME OF THE PAPERS CRITICISE THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS THAT LED TO THE DEAL THE GARDEN LAMENTS THE LATEST FIASCO IN WHAT PASSES FOR A SUMMIT THESE DAYS AS TWENTY EIGHT GROWN UPS WITH VERY DEMANDING DAY JOB STAY UP ALL NIGHT FOREGO MEALS AND CRAFT EELS THAT THEN FALL APART
THE INDEPENDENT SKETCH WRITER TOM PECK IS AMUSED BY HOW THE BRITISH BREAKFAST PLANNED TO PROCEED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A DEAL BECAME A BRITISH LUNCH AND THEN A BRITISH DINNER WRITING BEFORE A DEAL WAS CONFIRMED HE SAYS EVEN A LATE NIGHT BRITISH STONE HER FOLLETT FOR HER TIN I THINK IT MEANS FOLLOWED BY THE TRADITIONAL BRITISH CAB QUEUE PUNCH UP WAS LOOKING OUT OF THE QUESTION
MICHAEL GOES DECISION TO CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. PREACHERS WIDELY THE EXPRESS SHATTERING DEFECTION THE INDEPENDENT DESCRIBED IT AS A BITTER BLOW THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE MOVE WILL ELECTRIFY THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AND PLUNGE DAVID CAMERON INTO THE MOST PERILOUS PHASE OF HIS PREMIERSHIP AMID GROWING FEARS OF A LARGER THAN EXPECTED TORY BACKLASH THE TELEGRAPH AGREES WITH THAT IT NOTES THAT MY DECISION
WILL INTENSIFY SPECULATION THAT THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON IS IN FAVOUR OF A BRICKS IT THE DAILY MAIL BELIEVES THAT HE'S IDENTIFIED EUROPE'S REAL CRISIS AFTER EUROPOL SUGGESTED ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND IS FOR MISTER HARDY FANATICS COULD BE AT LARGE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE PAPER DESCRIBES THE WARNING AS CHILLING WHILE THE SUN CLAIMS THE REVELATION MADE TO A GERMAN NEWSPAPER BY THE BRITISH HEAD OF EUROPOL RAISES FEARS OF ANOTHER MASSACRE SUCH AS THE ONE IN PARIS LAST YEAR
THE EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES OF A FLAMBOYANT CONSERVATIVE PARTY DONOR AND ADVISOR ARE HIGHLIGHTED BY THE TIMES AFTER A TRIBUNAL HEARD HE HAS AVOIDED PAYING BILLIONS OF POUNDS OF NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS CHARLIE MULLINS WHO OWNS PIMLICO PLUMBERS INSISTS THAT HIS WORKFORCE HE IS SELF EMPLOYED THE TIMES HAS THE CASE WILL BE EMBARRASSING FOR THE CHANCELLOR BECAUSE HE'S PLEDGED TO CRACKDOWN ON COMPANIES WHO DESCRIBES EMPLOYMENT AS A SELF EMPLOYMENT MISTER THE HAS DENIED ANY WRONGDOING HE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THE ISSUE TO THE COURT OF APPEAL IN MAY

BECAUSE IT WAS BY ANY STANDARDS ARE GREAT
THE PROBLEM I HAVE MY DOUBTS I WONDER WILL NEVER KNOW THOUGH SHALL WE FOR SURE MICHAEL FRIEDLAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IN THE SPEAKER AND A CARD A STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND ROY JENKINS BAPTIST MINISTER IN CARDIFF GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING DONALD TRUMP WAS SAW THIS WEEK WHEN HIS PLANS FOR ENDING IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO RECEIVED A SEVERE REBUKE FROM AN UNEXPECTED QUARTER
A PERSON WHO THINKS ONLY ABOUT BUILDING WALLS WHEREVER THEY MAY BE AND NOT OF BUILDING BRIDGES IS NOT KRISTIAN SAID THE POPE NO LESS FRESH FROM A VISIT TO THE FAITHFUL OF THE U.S.A.'S SOUTHERN NEIGHBOUR THE REPUBLICAN FRONT RUNNER SAYS THE POPE HAS BEEN MISINFORMED AND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE SITUATION FOR A RELIGIOUS LEADER TO QUESTION A PERSON'S FAITH IS DISGRACEFUL HE THUNDERS I AM PROUD TO BE A CHRISTIAN
THE PONTIFF WENT ON TO OFFER HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BUT THE DAMAGE HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE
SO IS IT EVER RIGHT TO QUESTION A PERSON'S FACE SOMEONE SAYS THEY WERE CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM PER SEEKER WHATEVER WE TO PRONOUNCE OTHERWISE WHERE AS IT'S OFTEN ASSERTED ONLY GOD KNOWS OUR HEARTS
WERE RIGHTLY WARY ABOUT BEING JUDGEMENTAL
I SHUDDER TO THINK HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TURNED AWAY FROM FAITH BECAUSE AT SOME POINT THEY HAVE BEEN DISMISSED AS NOT BEING TRUE BELIEVERS WHEN THEY'VE HAD DOUBTS EXPRESSED DISCOMFORT AT A PARTICULAR STYLE OF WORSHIP WILL BE MADE TO FEEL THAT AFTER SOME PERSONAL FAILURE THEY COULD BE NO WAY BACK AND REMINDED OF THE STRONG WORDS OF JESUS ABOUT NOT CAUSING THE SIMPLEST BUT EVA TO STUMBLE
LIKE PEOPLE OF OTHER FAITHS OR NONE CHRISTIANS JOIN POLITICAL PARTIES WITH THEIR VISION FOR LOSS OF PHILOSOPHIES DISAGREE ABOUT HOW AN ECONOMY SHOULD BE RUN ABOUT WAR MIGRATION AND SEXUALITY AND EUROPE AND SO MUCH MORE
WE'RE TAUGHT NOT TO IMPUGN THE MOTIVES TO DISMISS THE BELIEFS OF THOSE WHO COME TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS
YET UNLESS WE SQUEEZE FAITH INTO A PURELY PRIVATE CONCERN NARROWLY SPIRITUAL WAS NO IMPACT AT ALL ON THE REST OF LIFE IT MUST BE POSSIBLE AT SOME POINT TO SUBVERT THAT FACE BY THE CHOICES WE MAKE THE POLICIES WE ENDORSE THE ATTITUDES WE ADOPT OR THE EVILS WE IGNORE
AND THAT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF HOW OFTEN WE TURN UP FOR WORSHIP OVER PASSIONATELY WE AFFIRM OUR ORTHODOXY OR CLAIM TO BE DEFENDING A TRADITION
ALONG WITH OTHERS THE THEOLOGIAN BEATRIX ON HER FOR SO THIS CLEARLY WHEN THE CHURCH IN GERMANY CAME UNDER PRESSURE TO IMPLEMENT THIRD REICH'S ANTI SEPARATISM
HE RECOGNISED THAT THIS WOULD LEAD TO FATAL COMPROMISE AT THE HEART OF THE CHRISTIAN MESSAGE
I CANNOT SING PSALMS IN THE GREGORIAN CHANT WITH THOSE WHO DO NOT CRY OUT FOR THE JEWS HE WROTE
IT REMAINS THE CASE THAT WHATEVER A FORMAL PROFESSION WE CAN IN PRACTICE STOP LIVING AS PEOPLE HAVE FAITH
IT'S BY THE FRUIT OF A LIVING BUT THE REALITY OR SELF DELUSION OF ANY FAITH IS TESTED
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND ROY JENKINS THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT AN EVICTION ORDER HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE AUTHORITIES IN CALAIS FOR UP TO TWO THOUSAND MIGRANTS LIVING IN PART OF THE CAMP KNOWN AS THE JUNGLE THEY NOW HAVE TO REMOVE THEMSELVES AND THEIR POSSESSIONS OR THEY WILL BE FORCIBLY REMOVED POSSIBLY WITH THE HELP OF THE FRENCH SECURITY FORCES
THE ORDER APPLIES TO THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE CAMP WHICH IS THE MOST BUILT UP MAKESHIFT SHOPS CAFES MOSQUES AND CHURCHES WERE JOINED NOW BY OUR CORRESPONDENT ON ARTHUR SEE WHO'S IN CALAIS AT TOM OR HOW LONG DO THEY HAVE TO LEAVE
THE LOCAL AUTHORITY HAD GIVEN THE MIGRANTS A WEEK TO MOVE OUT OF THIS SOUTHERN PART OF THE JUNGLE CAMP THE PART THAT YOU DID THIS CRIME
AND NOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF MIGRANTS REMAIN OVER THE LAST WEEK THEY HAD
STEAK REPRESENTATIVES GOING THROUGH THE CAMP
CAN BITE AND HAILING THE MIGRANT BUT THEY HAD TWO OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE THEY COULD RELOCATE INTO NEWLY BUILT
PING CONVERTED CONTAINERS OR THEY COULD TAKE A BUS TO THE TEMPORARY FENCES SOMEONE ELSE
WHAT DO YOUR PRIORITY THEY BEING THE MAJORITY DIDN'T DO IT
THEY ARE GIVEN UNTIL TUESDAY EVENING AND OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE FORCIBLY EVICTED STARTING TODAY AND WHY DOES IT SEEM THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT TAKING UP THOSE OTHER OPTIONS
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THERE HOW ONE AIM IT IS BRITAIN'S BAY OF CONFLICT KALLIE AND THE LAST STOP IN FRANCE
GANGS STAND FROM YOU RAN FROM THE IRAQ MENU FROM DEMI RELEASED OTHERS FROM AFRICA AND THEY'RE SAYING WE WANT TO GO TO BRITAIN
YOU CAN SLOT THEN YOU CAN EVICT THEM THEY YOU HAVE THAT'S A THEY WANT TO TRY TO GET ON TRUCKS ON THE LORRY
UNTRAINED UNDER FAREED ENGLAND AND THAT'S NOT CHANGED SO IF THEY ARE STILL THERE AT THE POINT THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE HAVE HAVE SET US THE DEADLINE ARE THEY REALLY GOING TO MOVE IN WITH BULLDOZERS ALL THE SECURITY FORCES
A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT KITCHEN WILL LEAD THE CLASHES BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE MIGRANT
ALSO SOME OF THE ACTIVISTS WHO ARE IN THE CAMP SOME OF THE VOLUNTEERS WHO WERE HELPING
AND SUPPORTING THE MIGRANTS THERE IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS DICTION WILL BE
AT PIERRE'S FUNNY BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S HARD TO PREDICT BUT THE PEOPLE
ARE DETERMINED THAT THEY WANT TO STAY THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO UNLESS THEY CAN
WE CAN ALL INTO BRITAIN DEPLETED BARNHAM THERE AND DOES IT SEEM AS IF THIS EFFORT ON ONE PART OF THE CAMP IS THIS IS THE START OF AN EFFORT EVENTUALLY DECLARE IT COMPLETELY
EXACTLY I THINK THE AUTHORITY IN HERE WANT TO CLOSE DOWN THE WHOLE CAMP EVENTUALLY THEY ARE STARTING WITH THE SOUTHERN PARTS
BUT BEAR IN MIND THAT AS YOU SAID THIS IN THE CULTURAL AND COMMERCIAL HUB OF THE JUNGLES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE OTHER SHOPS THEY'RE BIG RESTAURANT
THAT COMMUNITY AND IT'S QUITE UNDERSTANDING THAT UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE HAD THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING TO BREAK THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY
YOU SEE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CHLOE IT OUT OF THE CAMP I WOULD UNDERLINE THOMAS ESSIE AND CALAIS THANK YOU NOW THE WEATHER FORECAST OH DEAR YOU WIN GOOD MORNING

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE TWENTIETH OF FEBRUARY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON SAYS HE'S READY TO CAMPAIGN HEART AND SOUL TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AFTER REACHING A DEAL WITH E.U. LEADERS THAT HE SAYS GIVES BRITAIN SPECIAL STATUS
THE CABINET WILL MEET THIS MORNING AFTER WHICH MINISTERS WILL BE FREE TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT EITHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT IN THE FORTHCOMING REFERENDUM BUT CRITICS SAY MISTER CAMERON HASN'T WON THE REFORMS HE PROMISED THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY ZEB SENDS DAVID CAMERON HAS SAID A DELIA SECURED TO REFORM BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT AFTER MARATHON TALKS IN BRUSSELS THE STOWE SPECIAL STATUS ON THE U.K. THE PRIME MINISTER INSISTED HE HAD ACHIEVED HIS AIMS AND HE WOULD URGE VOTERS TO CHOOSE TO STAY IN THE E.U. AT THE FORTHCOMING REFERENDUM
BUT THOSE IN FAVOUR OF A BRITISH EXIT WERE QUICK TO CONDEMN THE AGREEMENT SAYING MISTER CAMERON HAS FAILED TO DELIVER THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES HE HAD PROMISED FROM BRUSSELS HERE'S A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS AFTER YEARS OF TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO REFORM THE E.U. AND TWO DAYS OF TOUGH FACE TO FACE NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS SPECIFIC DEAL DAVID CAMERON GOT THE AGREEMENT HE SAID HE WANTED IN ORDER TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN TO KEEP THE U.K. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
TURNING OUR BACK ON THE E. U. IS NO SOLUTION AT ALL WE SHOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF THOSE WHO CLAIM THAT LEAVING EUROPE IS SOME AUTOMATIC FAST TRACKED TO A LAND OF MILK AND HONEY
WE ALL NEED TO STEP BACK AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY WHAT IS BEST FOR BRITAIN WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR FUTURE
CRITICS HAVE ALREADY CONDEMNED THIS DEAL AS A SHOWER AND SOME OF THE SPECIFICS FALL SHORT OF WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAD IN SPEECHES AND MANIFESTOS PREVIOUSLY PLEDGED TO ACHIEVE
BUT IF VOTERS CHOOSE TO STAY IN THE E.U. THE AGREEMENT MEANS THAT FOR UP TO SEVEN YEARS SOME BENEFITS FOR E.U. WORKERS CAN BE LIMITED DURING THEIR FIRST FOUR YEARS IN THE U.K. CHILD BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO SOME MIGRANT WORKERS WILL ALSO BE REDUCED
AS AN EXPLICIT COMMITMENT THAT THE U.K. WILL NOT BE PART OF AN EVER CLOSER UNION WITH OTHER E.U. MEMBER STATES AND COUNTRIES THAT DON'T USE THE EURO WILL HAVE A SAFEGUARD MECHANISM TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT EUROZONE DECISIONS
THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT DONALD TUSK SAID NO ONE WAS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT HAPPY WITH THE DEAL BUT THAT WAS THE NATURE OF A FAIR COMPROMISE I DEEPLY BELIEF THAT THEY HAVE THAT KING IT'S YOUR FRIEND YOU UP STAY THE NIGHT AT KING
STIRLING WOULD BE TOTALLY AGAINST OUR MUTUAL INTEREST
ALL OF THE COURTS LOTS TO LET THAT HAPPEN BUT THE FINAL THIS IS IN THIS IN THE HANDS OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE THERE WAS RESISTANCE FROM SEVERAL COUNTRIES ON SEVERAL ISSUES BUT A DESIRE TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT BRITAIN STAYS IN THE E.U. AS THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL EXPLAINED
AND OF COURSE BUT I KNEW I DON'T THINK WE'VE GET UP TO MUCH AND WE'VE HAD A HARD TIME BUT SOME OF THE ISSUES BRITAIN HAS COME TO US HAS PUT ITS REQUESTS ON THE TABLE WE WERE NOT DUTY TO NEGOTIATE THEM WE DID THIS ONE TERRIBLY AND BECAUSE WE ALL OF US CONVINCED OF THE MERITS OF THE KILL
E.U. LEADERS ASSERT THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS LEGALLY BINDING ALTHOUGH PARTS OF IT WILL REQUIRE NEW LEGISLATION NEEDING THE APPROVAL OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
THIS MAY NOT BE A FUNDAMENTAL RENEGOTIATION OF THE U.K.'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. BUT IT DOES SAID BRITAIN APART FROM THE REST DAVID CAMERON WILL HOLD A SPECIAL CABINET MEETING THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE DEAL AND SET A DATE FOR THE REFERENDUM WIDELY EXPECTED TO BE IN JUNE
IS EXPECTED TO FACE OPPOSITION FROM SEVERAL MINISTERS INCLUDING HIS LONG STANDING ALLY THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO FOR WHO HAS DECIDED TO CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS A ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
DOWNING STREET ARE RESIGNED TO AROUND SIX CABINET MINISTERS OPPOSING THE PRIME MINISTER'S DEAL MOST WOUNDING WILL BE MICHAEL GOES DECISION TO SIDE WITH THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND OF THE PRIME MINISTER HE BRINGS LEGITIMACY AND CREDIBILITY TO THE LEE SIDE AND WILL FURTHER CRANK UP THE PRESSURE ON BORIS JOHNSON TO JOIN HIM AFTER CABINET MUST CAMERON WILL MAKE A STATEMENT IN DOWNING STREET TO ANNOUNCE THE DATE OF THE REFERENDUM EXPECTED TO BE JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD AND TO SET OUT THE CASE FOR HIS DEAL
PACKAGE DESCRIBED BY THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOMINIC GRIEVE AS A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT IT IS THE SINGLE WITHOUT DOUBT IT IS THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DEBATE ON THE REFERENDUM COMING UP THIS POINT SEEMS BY THE DETRACTORS THE PEOPLE WHO WANT BRECHT'S IT AND WANT TO LEAVE TO BE COMPLETELY IGNORED
MISTER CAMERON IS ALSO GUARANTEED WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS THE SUPPORT OF THE LABOUR PARTY THE SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY HILARY BENN
THE VAST MAJORITY OF LABOUR M.P.S THE LABOUR MOVEMENT THE LABOUR PARTY CONFERENCE THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT SUPPORTS OUR CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP WHY BECAUSE BEING IN THE E.U. HAS GIVEN US JOBS INVESTMENT GROWTH IT'S GIVES HER SECURITY AND IT GIVES US INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD AND WHY WOULD WE WANT TO EXCHANGE ALL OF THAT FOR A LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN
CRITICS INSIST THE DEAL SECURED BY MISTER CAMERON HAS FAILED TO MATCH HIS PLEDGE TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE U.K.'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. THE CONSERVATIVE M.E.P. DANIEL HANNAN WHO SUPPORTS THE VOTE LEAVE GROUP SAID BRITAIN BANGED THE TABLE AND AGGRESSIVELY DEMANDED THE STATUS QUO AND AT A RALLY LAST NIGHT THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL FARAGE WAS SCATHING ABOUT THE AGREEMENT
IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE AS YOU THAT OUR PARLIAMENT IS NOT ABLE TO OVERALL BAD E.U. LAW IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE
WE SHOULD NOT BE PAYING FIFTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS A DAY TO A CLUB WHOSE ACCOUNTS HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNED OFF FOR NEARLY TWENTY
AND IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTALIST VIEW THAT WE HAVE A TOTAL OPEN DOOR TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE
MANY TORY M.P.S WILL NOW AWAIT TO SEE MY CAMERON'S PLANS FOR BOLSTERING PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY LIKELY TO BE A CLIENT TOMORROW AMONG THEM THE MAYOR OF LONDON HE IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE WAITING TO SEE THE FINAL DETAILS BEFORE DECLARING WHAT HE WILL DO A DECISION WHICH COULD YET RADICALLY TRANSFORM THE COURSE OF THIS REFERENDUM
THE AUTHORITIES IN FRANCE HAVE ORDERED THE EVICTION OF MIGRANTS LIVING IN PART OF THEIR MAKESHIFT CAMP THERE CALAIS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN UNTIL WEDNESDAY TO LEAVE THE CAMP SOUTHERN SECTION WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE JUNGLE TOM A FECIT REPORTS FROM CALAIS
THE LOCAL AUTHORITY HAD GIVEN THE MIGRANTS A WEEK TO MOVE OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE JUNGLE CAMP IT NOW SAYS THAT SINCE THE MAJORITY THERE REMAIN THERE WILL BE FORCIBLY EVICTED THE CLEARING WILL START ON WEDNESDAY NEXT WEEK THE AUTHORITIES SAY UP TO ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED BUT VOLUNTEERS UNDERGROUND BELIEVE THAT ME USED TWICE THAT NUMBER LEAVE IN THE CAMPS SAGEN HALF
IT IS THE CULTURAL AND COMMERCIAL HARBOUR OF THE JUNGLE MIGRANTS HAVE BUILT SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS AT THERE THERE'S ALSO A CHURCH AND A MOSQUE BUT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE PLEDGED TO LEAVE THEM IN PLACE THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT THE EVICTION WILL LEAD TO CLASHES BETWEEN THE POLICE AND MIGRANTS
THE CONTEST TO CHOOSE THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ENTERS ANOTHER IMPORTANT STAGE WITH VOTERS IN SOUTH CAROLINA MAKING THEIR DECISION DONALD TRUMP REMAINS THE FRONT RUNNER AS A NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOAP REPORTS
HISTORY SUGGESTS THAT WHOEVER WINS IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY GOES ON TO WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION AND THE PERSON WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN AHEAD IN THE POLLS AND HAS DOMINATED NEWS COVERAGE PARTICULARLY AFTER HIS LATEST SPAT WITH OF ALL PEOPLE THE POPE IS DONALD TRUMP
IF THAT POLL LEAD TRANSLATES INTO REAL VOTES THAT WILL CONFIRM HIM AS THE RUNAWAY FAVOURITE TO BE THE REPUBLICAN STANDARD BEARER IN NOVEMBER
BUT SOUTH CAROLINA COULD EQUALLY BE THE DEATH KNELL OF JEB BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS WHO UNTIL MISTER TRUMP ENTERED THE FRAY WAS THE FAVOURITE TO WIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND DESPITE HAVING SPENT MORE THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE HE'S FAILED TO GAIN TRACTION DEMOCRATS IN NEVADA ARE ALSO VOTING ERNIE A FEW WEEKS AGO HILLARY CLINTON WAS CONSIDERED UNBEATABLE IN THE STATE BUT HE'S FACING A STRONG CHALLENGE FROM BERNIE SANDERS

REFERENDUM WILL BE ANNOUNCED LATER THIS MORNING AFTER THE CABINET MEETING THERE TAKES PLACE AT TEN THAT IS WHAT WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM THE PRIME MINISTER HIS MARATHON TALKS IN BRUSSELS WHICH ENDED WITH HIM SAYING THE DEAL GIVES BRITAIN THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS AND A ONCE IN A GENERATION CHANCE TO SHAPE OUR DESTINY NOW SET THE STAGE FOR THAT REFERENDUM WILL HEAR FROM ONE OF HIS M.P.S SHORTLY BUT FIRST A REPORTER TOM BATEMAN IS IN DUNSTABLE IN BEDFORDSHIRE

WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IT MAKE IS GOING TO BE A HEARTY BRITISH BREAKFAST OR THE FROTH TO BE BLOWN OFF THE TOP OF THE EURO COFFEE LET'S TALK TO SEVERAL VOTERS THAT WE'VE GOT WITH THIS HERE I'M JOINED BY CLIVE AND JAN DUCK MANTON BY TONY CATES AND CLIVE BATES WHO ARE ALL FROM DUNSTABLE AND CLUB I'D LIKE TO START WITH YOU REALLY BECAUSE YOU TOLD US BEFORE THE DEAL WAS DONE THAT YOU WEREN'T SURE YOU HAD ONE FOOT ON THE CONTINENT ONE IN BRITAIN IF YOU LIKE YOU WERE WAVERING WE'VE GOT THE DEAL THE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM DAVID CAMERON
HAS IT TAKEN YOU IN ONE PARTICULAR DIRECTION OR NOT IT HASN'T TOTALLY AT THIS STAGE BECAUSE I FEEL AFTER MISTER CAMERON'S ACTUALLY HAD SOME SLEEP AND ACTUALLY GIVEN ALL THE FACTS I COULDN'T MAKE A DEFINITE DECISION AT THIS STAGE
I'VE GOT TWO SIDES OF THE ONE I WANT THE COUNTRY TO BE INDEPENDENT BUT THEY KNOW I'M SCARED
WE COME OUT OF THE E.U. WHETHER THAT IS GOING TO AFFECT THE COUNTRY BADLY SO I'M STILL WANT TO I KNOW HE'S DONE THE BEST HE CAN
EASY ENOUGH REMAINS TO BE SEEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A LACK OF INFORMATION YOU FELL YOU KIND OF WOKE UP THIS MORNING IT WAS VERY HARD TO TELL WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED YES IT WAS IT IS IN A WAY
I THINK IS THERE ANY COST GUARANTEES THAT THESE DAYS
IMPROVEMENTS ARE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY
WHAT ABOUT YOU JAN SO YOU SAID WHEN WE SPOKE TO YOU BEFORE THE DEAL WAS DONE HE'D WANT TO BE IN EUROPE YOU VOTED NOW BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
AS IT'S CHANGE YOUR MIND ABSOLUTELY NOT IT'S MADE ME EVEN MORE DETERMINED TO VOTE TO LEAVE AS I SAID BEFORE IT'S INVITED TO A CHILDREN'S PARTY EVERYBODY ELSE GETS A GOODY BAG AND WE JUST GET A LOLLIPOP AND IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
HE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE ENGLISH PEOPLE AND IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR OUR FUTURE LET'S COME UP WITH NOTHING THERE'S DAVID CAMERON WOULD SAY THEY LOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME BRITAIN HAS SPECIAL STATUS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT WE HAVE THE PROTECTION OF THE POUND THE STUFF THAT'S GONNA BE THINGS WRITTEN INTO TREATIES THAT DOES THAT NOT MAKE YOU THINK WE'LL HOLD ON A MINUTE WE HAVE CHANGED THE GAME HERE PERHAPS I COULD CHANGE
ABSOLUTELY NOT BEFORE THE INK WAS DRY ON THE AGREEMENT THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTERS ALREADY COME OUT AND SAID THE DEAL IS NOT BINDING SO WE HAVEN'T EVEN WALKED AWAY FROM THE PARTY YET BEFORE THEY THROW IN THE PARTY BAGS AWAY
TONY WHAT ABOUT YOU WERE YOU WHICH WAY YOU GOING ARNSTEIN THANK THAT WE SHOULD STAY IN I THINK HE'S GOING TO DO IS ECONOMY WISE VERY GOOD
UM
ROSSBY SEO FEAR WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE MIGRATION I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT HE'S GOT A DEAL NOW
DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO CHANGE MY GRACE I MEAN WE HEAR ABOUT THE SEVEN YEAR RESTRICTION ON IN WORK BENEFITS FOR MIGRANTS BUT BUT NOTHING THAT WILL CHANGE THAT FUNDAMENTAL POINT ABOUT THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE
NO IT WON'T BUT
THE FACT IS THAT WE DO NEED MIGRANTS WOULD IN THIS COUNTRY FOR THE LOWER PAID JOB
THEY ARE OUT THERE AND WE HAVEN'T GOT THE WORKFORCE TO DO IT AND THEREFORE IT IS A BENEFIT FOR THIS COUNTRY ON THAT SIDE OF IT CLIVE WHAT ABOUT YOU YOU WERE WAVERING BEFORE THE DEAL WAS DONE YOU WOKE UP THIS MORNING HAVE YOU PASSIONATELY ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER NO I KNOW I'M STILL WAVERING I THINK WE'RE
LOOKING AT THE TAIL AND ONE THING ANOTHER I THINK WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE
REQUIRED TO SIT DOWN AND LOOK THROUGH IT JUST GET THE FEELING OF WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY ACHIEVED WHAT DAVID CAMERON'S ACTUALLY ACHIEVED I'M AWFUL
STAYING IN EUROPE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF BENISON BENEFITS FROM THAT BUT WITH THIS DEAL I'M NOT TERRIBLY SURE IT HAS SWAYED ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SO I'M REALLY ON THE FENCE AND I NEED TO SEE HAVE MORE INFORMATION
AND BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS ON BOARD AND MAKE THE DECISION
THING IS TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT THERE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR COMING HERE THIS MORNING TO BE FASCINATING TALKING TO YOU AND I THINK ONE THING WE'VE LEARNT WHEN I CERTAINLY CAME AT THIS MONEY PEOPLE FELT THEY JUST WANTED TO PICK ALL THAT DEAL ACTUALLY MEANS AND I'M SURE THAT
WITH WHAT WE KNOW WILL BE A VERY BIG DECISION ON THE WAY THAT WILL HAVE SEVERAL WEEKS OF THAT'S TO COME NOW I THINK WE JUST GOT TIME FOR OUR ENGLISH BREAKFAST MICHELLE SAFE WITH THAT BACK TO YOU
JOHN BATEMAN IN DUNSTABLE IN BEDFORDSHIRE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE JOINED BY THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. FOR BERWICK UPON TWEED AND MARIE TREVELYAN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING YOU HAVE FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED EUROSCEPTIC VIEWS NOW THAT WE HAVE THE DEAL HOW HAVE YOU DECIDED TO CAMPAIGN
I'M AFRAID THE DEAL HASN'T DONE ANYTHING OTHER THAN CONFIRMED MY VIEW THAT THE E. U. INTENDS TO CONTINUE AS IT DID BEFORE SO I'LL BE VOTING TO LEAVE AND YOU ARE BASING THAT ON WHAT PRECISELY WHAT WAS IT A BIT IN THE DEAL THE DISAPPOINTED YOU IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR
WELL TO BE HONEST WHEN WE SAW TUSKS DRAFT LETTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO MY HEART SANK BECAUSE I THINK ALL THE PRIME MINISTER'S BEST EFFORTS TO GET THROUGH TO THE E.U. OFFICIALS AND LEADERS THAT THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION
FOR GREAT BRITAIN AND THE TAY REALLY REFORMED CHANGED POSITION WHICH MEANT THEM UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE A MARITIME NATION WE'RE NOT PART OF THE LAND BLOCK OF EUROPE WE WANTED TO HAVE A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP WHICH WAS BASED ON TRADE NOT ON BEING PART OF THE EVER MORE COMPLEX LEGISLATIVE WORLD OF THE Y. YOU DON'T THINK LISTEN NOW THAT THAT THAT THE U.K. DOES HAVE THIS SPECIAL STATUS FOR EXAMPLE AN OPT OUT FROM EVER CLOSER UNION AN AGREEMENT THAT DOES NOT APPLY TO THE UNITED KINGDOM
YES AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND LET'S HOPE THAT WHEN THE NEXT TREATY COMES ALONG THAT STILL THERE I DON'T HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE WE'VE ASKED FOR OVER SEVENTY THINGS TO CHANGE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN OVERTURNED AND THEY'VE ROLLED FORWARDS ANYWAY I'M AFRAID MY CONFIDENCE IN THE E.U. OFFICIALS AND THOSE LEADERS IS JUST VERY VERY LES WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS FOR US TO HAVE THE SAFER POSITION OF TAKING BACK CONTROL OF OUR NATION AND OUR LAWS
REBUILDING A REALLY STRONG TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. SO THAT WE ARE IN CHARGE OF OUR DESTINY AND WE WORK WELL WITH THEM RATHER THAN BEING PUSHED AROUND CONSTANTLY BY CONTINUING LEGISLATION WHICH DOES NOT HELP GREAT BRITAIN
THAT IMPLIES THAT THAT WHATEVER DAVID CAMERON CAME BACK WITH HER YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TRUSTED E.U. INSTITUTIONS TO ENSHRINE IT
NO I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY I'VE SEEN I HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER HE'S A VERY OLD FRIEND AND I THINK HE HAS DONE HIS LEVEL BEST TO TRY TO GET THROUGH TO THE E.U. HOW IMPORTANT GETTING A REFORMED
A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU KAY IS BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE STILL OFFERS THAT AND I THINK THE SAFE CHOICE WILL BE TO VOTE TO LEAVE BUT HE'S GOT A SEVEN YEAR BREAK ON IN WORK BENEFITS IN CASES OF EXCEPTIONAL MIGRATION WHICH IS WHAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS ALREADY RECOGNISED THAT THE U.K. IS FACING THAT THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE
NO NEED UNDERSTANDS THAT WHILST A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES TO RESTRICT MIGRATION LABOUR LABOUR GOVERNMENTS CHOSE NOT TO TAKE THAT UP IT STILL IT'S A TEMPORARY THING AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THEM DETERMINING WHETHER WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO IT THAT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE BRITISH PEOPLE WANT
TO HAVE CONTROL OF THEIR BORDERS WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN HERE WANT TO HELP GREAT THE ECONOMY WHEN WE NEED THEM NOT E.U. NATIONALS WHO CAN WANDER ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OF THEM WHENEVER IT SUITS THEM BUT THOSE WHO WE WANT SO IF WE WANT DOCTORS TO COME IN AND HELP OUR N.H.S. COMING FROM SIERRA LEONE ORE FROM INDIA WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TERM IN THAT A MIGRATION SHOULD NOT BE DETERMINED
BY THE FACT THAT WE'VE ALREADY GOT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION E.U. NATIONALS WHO WERE ABLE TO COME AND GO WELL IT WOULD BUT THIS MECHANISM ONE IT MAY BE TEMPORARY WOULD STILL ASKED FOR SEVEN YEARS WHICH IS A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME
WELL SEVEN YEARS OR SEVEN YEARS BUT IT MISSES THE POINT WHICH IS AT THE BRITISH PEOPLE WANTED TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR BORDERS AND THIS DOES NOT GIVE US CONTROL OF IT AS THIS IS THE E. YOU VERY KINDLY SEND FOR SEVEN YEARS THEY GET THIS IS PROBLEM SEVEN YEARS WILL GO VERY QUICKLY THE WORLD WILL BE WHEREVER IT WILL BE IN SEVEN YEARS BUT THE POINT IS WE STILL WON'T BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHO COMES IN WHERE A VERY DENSELY POPULATED NATION ALREADY ONE OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED IN THE EUROPEAN
CONTINENTS AND WE NEED TO BE IN CHARGE AND I'M AFRAID HOWEVER HARD THE PREMISE TO TRY THE OFFICIALS JUST WEREN'T UNDERSTANDING THAT PROBLEM THAT'S JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH YES AND YOUR MIND IS MADE UP WHO DO YOU WANT TO LEAD THE BODY OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL AS YOU DO WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE GRASS OUT RALLY LAST NIGHT WHEN GEORGE GALLOWAY WAS WAS UNVEILED AS THEM AS THE BIG MISTREAT SPEAKER WHO ARE YOU PINNING YOUR HOPES ON IS IT MICHAEL GO
I WOULD BE THRILLED WITH MICHAEL GAVE WANTED TO COME AND JOIN THE LIVE CAMPAIGN AND UNDERSTAND WILL KNOW LACE TODAY WHO'S LIKELY TO DECLARE PUBLICALLY BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICIANS HEALING THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT CAMPAIGNS MAKE CLEAR WHAT THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS AT THE BACK AND THE BRITISH PEOPLE
TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY WHICH THE PRIME MINISTER HAS GIVEN US BY PROVIDING A REFERENDUM AND IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT FOR THEIR COUNTRY IT'S NOT ABOUT POLITICIANS AND FOR ONCE I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY QUITE A GOOD THING BUT SOMEONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO LEAD THEIR LEAVE CAMPAIGN AREN'T THEY SOMEONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO REPRESENT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND TO BE UP AGAINST THE PRIME MINISTER MAKING THE ARGUMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO SHOULD THAT BE
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR ANY NUMBER OF VOICES TO DO IT I THINK THE BOAT LEAVE CAMPAIGN PRESENT A VERY BALANCED AND BROAD BRUSH SET OF VIEWS ON THE ISSUE AND I'LL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM AS A CAMPAIGN GROUP I THINK THE KEY POINT IS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON WHAT
REMAINING LOOKS LIKE THE RISKS OF REMAINING AND HOW MUCH SAFER WE COULD BE BY TAKING CONTROL TO VOTE LEAVE GETTING BACK CONTROL OF THAT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK THAT PRESENTLY GOES TO BRUSSELS I DON'T WANT MY FARMERS ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO BE TOLD HOW THEY CAN GET THERE
THEY'RE C.A.P. MONEY I'D LIKE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IT SO THAT THEY CAN TALK DIRECTLY TO US THIS CAN WORK SO MUCH BETTER FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE FOR BUSINESS FOR FAMILIES IF WE ARE IN CHARGE OF OUR DESTINY ONCE AGAIN AND RE TREVELYAN THANK YOU WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE IN ANOTHER TEN MINUTES TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT NOW IN THE PAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE DEATHS OF TWO WORLD FAMOUS AUTHORS HARPER LEAVE COURSE WE TALKED ABOUT
AN HOUR AGO AND UMBERTO ECO WHO DIED ON FRIDAY HIS DEATH WAS NOT ANNOUNCED UNTIL MIDNIGHT A VERY DIFFERENT SORT OF WRITER FROM HARPER LEE OF COURSE A MAN ON BOOKS IS JIM HE'S IN EDINBURGH JIM EXTRAORDINARY IN MANY WAYS THIS MAN
WELL INDEED JOHN AN INTERESTING MORNING WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CROSS BORDER POLITICS AND EUROPE AS WE HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST FEW MINUTES AND WILL BE FOR THE REST OF THE PROGRAMME THERE'S A CULTURAL MOMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE IN EUROPE AS WELL THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER MARIA N.Z. IN BRUSSELS OF COURSE SAID HE WAS ECHO WAS A EUROPEAN INTELLECTUAL WHO A GREATER INFLUENCE THEN HE PROBABLY REALISED FAR BEYOND THE BORDERS OF HIS OWN COUNTRY AND FOR MANY PEOPLE OF COURSE IT WAS THE NAME OF THE ROSE THAT NOVEL FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY THAT BROUGHT HIM INTO THEIR LIVES THAT WAS A ROARING SUCCESS AS YOU KNOW SELLING AROUND THE WORLD
AT ONE LEVEL A GOOD OLD FASHIONED IN A WAY TORTUOUS MURDER MYSTERY SET IN THE RATHER CLAUSTROPHOBIC SURROUNDINGS OF A FOURTEENTH CENTURY MONASTERY BUT ALSO AN EXPLANATION OF WHY PEOPLE KEEP SECRETS IN THIS CASE A SUPPOSED LOST TREE DESPITE ARISTOTLE THAT SAID THINGS ABOUT HUMOUR BUT THE MUGS REALLY DIDN'T LIKE MAYBE SCARED THEM AND OF COURSE HE BUMPED OFF ONE BY ONE HER SOMEONE TRIES TO KEEP A SECRET THERE'S A LOT OF HUMOUR AS WELL AS JUST A RICH ROLLICKING STORY TERRIBLE FILM UNFORTUNATELY SEAN CONNERY LOOKING PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE IN A MONASTERY BUT ANYWAY
A GREAT FEELING FOR LITERARY AND CULTURAL TRADITION NO ECHO TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BOLOGNA THE OLDEST IN EUROPE AND THE REASON THAT HE WASN'T A PHILOSOPHER WHO JUST WROTE FOR OTHER PHILOSOPHERS HE SAID HE ONLY WROTE FICTION AT THE WEEKENDS WAS IT HIS INTEREST LAY IN FINDING ALL THE PATTERNS AND SYMBOLS THAT GAVE A COMMON CULTURED IT SHAPE BUT THE NAME OF THE ROSE OF COURSE MADE HIM A GREAT CELEBRITY WHEN IT WAS ON DESERT ISLAND DISCS IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE HE WAS ASKED HAVE ENJOYED THAT FIT
IF YOU MEAN THAT GUY AND JARRED BE
ALL OVER THE WORK YES I DO WHY IS WHY HWANG SHOULD RIGHT
IT'LL BE A RECOGNISED US I DON'T KNOW I DON'T I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE A MORE PRIVATE LIFE BUT MY BOOKS OUT OF MY CHILDREN SO I HAVE TO WORK FOR MY BOOKS AND I HAVE TO BAY
SO COMPRISING LOSIN MY BRIBE US THAT'S US DONE FOR MY MOUSE BUT HE WAS A BELIEVER IN BOOKS AND HE MADE A CASE FOR CULTURE OVER MANY YEARS AND HIS INFLUENCE IN THE WAY THAT CULTURAL DISCIPLINES WERE TAUGHT WAS ENORMOUS HERE'S GEORGE LAKE OFF OF THE UNIVERSE IT CALIFORNIAN BERKELEY WHO WAS A FRIEND OF ECHOES FOR DECADES AND INFLUENCE IS MUCH GREATER MOST PEOPLE APPRECIATE
WHAT HE DID IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHEN HE WAS GETTING A P.H.D. IN ITALY IN LITERATURE WAS TO CHANGE THE VERY IDEA OF WHAT LITERATURE STUDIES WERE HE MADE IT RESPECTABLE TO DO WHAT IS NOW CALLED CULTURAL STUDIES TO ACTUALLY STUDY MOVIES SERIOUSLY
TO STUDY MUSIC SERIOUSLY TO TAKE PRODUCTS OF CULTURE SERIOUSLY AS AN ACADEMIC STUDY BUT SHE USE IT IN A WAY TO CREATE NEW
WELL HE WAS THE VERY PICTURE OF A PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL REMOVED HAPPILY ACROSS CULTURES AND LANGUAGES YOU ONCE TOLD AN INTERVIEWER I'M NOT A FUNDAMENTALIST WHO SAYS THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOMER AND WALT DISNEY BUT MICKEY MICE CAN BE PERFECT IN THE SENSE THAT THE JAPANESE HAIKU IS AND HE WAS ALREADY WITH SOME MEMORABLE LINE HE SAID THIS ABOUT THE WAY WE WE LEARN HE SAID I BELIEVE THAT
WHAT WE BECOME DEPENDS ON WHAT OUR FATHERS TEACHERS AT ODD MOMENTS WHEN THEY AREN'T TRYING TO TEACHERS WERE FORMED BY LITTLE SCRAPS OF WISDOM AND HIS SCRAPS OF WISDOM JOHN MOUNTED UP AND THEY WERE ALL SHARED HE BECAME A FIGURE WHO SEEMED TO BE REALLY WISE AND SKITTISH
AT THE SAME TIME RIGHT AND SCEPTICAL BUT SOMEBODY WHO LOVED STORYTELLING AND THE HISTORY OF THOUGHT WITH AN EQUAL PASSION AND HE MUSED MOVED ACROSS CULTURES REALLY WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF
A GREAT GOURMET ALWAYS READY FOR THE NEXT TREAT UMBERTO ECO

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH MICHELLE FOR AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE TIME IS NOW HALF PAST EIGHT ON THE BUTTON SOMETHING NEW FROM ZEB SOAMES DAVID CAMERON HAS HAD LAST NIGHT'S DEAL TO REFORM BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION PER STOWE SPECIAL STATUS ON THE U.K. THE AGREEMENT INCLUDES CURBS ON MIGRANTS BENEFITS AN EXEMPTION FOR THE U.K. FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EVER CLOSER UNION HE SAID HE WOULD CAMPAIGN STRONGLY FOR BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE E.U.
THOSE IN FAVOUR OF A BRITISH EXIT WERE QUICK TO CONDEMN THE AGREEMENT SAYING MISTER CAMERON HAD FAILED TO DELIVER THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES HE HAD PROMISED TO CAMERON WILL HOLD A SPECIAL CABINET MEETING THIS MORNING THE FIRST TO BE HELD ON A SATURDAY SINCE THE FALKLANDS CONFLICT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO TO DISCUSS THE DEAL AND SET A DATE FOR THE REFERENDUM
THE AUTHORITIES IN FRANCE HAVE ORDERED THE EVICTION OF MIGRANTS LIVING IN PART OF THEIR MAKESHIFT CAMP NEAR CALAIS OFFICIALS ONE OF THE MIGRANTS TO LEAVE THE CAMP SOUTHERN SECTION BY WEDNESDAY AND MOVED TO OTHER CENTRES IN FRANCE ITALIAN AUTHOR AND PHILOSOPHER ON BETTER ECO HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY FOUR HIS FIRST NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE MADE HIM AN INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITY
IT'S NOW TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE THE PHONEY WAR IS OVER AND NOW THE BATTLE BEGINS AT TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THE CABINET WILL MEET ON A MONDAY PARLIAMENT WILL PASS A LAW AUTHORISING THE REFERENDUM IN WHICH WE WILL VOTE ON WHETHER TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR TO LEAVE IT MISTER CAMERON WILL GIVE US THE DATE AFTER TODAY'S CABINET MEETING EVERYONE EXPECTED BE JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD THOSE CABINET MINISTERS WHO WANT TO LEAVE WILL SOON BE FREED A CAMPAIGN FOR THE FIRST TIME MICHAEL GO AMONG THEM
THE TWENTY EIGHT EUROPEAN LEADERS FINISH THE NEGOTIATIONS LAST NIGHT IN AT TEN PAST TEN DAVID CAMERON ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD GOT WHAT HE WANTED THAT CLAIM WILL BE TESTED MANY TIMES OVER THE COMING MONTHS HE TOLD US TWO MONTHS AGO THAT YOU WANTED NOTHING LESS THAN FUNDAMENTAL FAR REACHING CHANGE IS THAT WHAT HE HAS ACHIEVED A QUESTION
FOR THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WHO WAS WITH ME NOW AND THE REALITY MISTER OSBORNE IS THAT IT ISN'T VISIT AND FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE FOR MANY PEOPLE WHICH WAS TO RETAIN CONTROL HER REGAIN CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS WE HAVEN'T REGAINED CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS HAVE WE
WELL I DENNIS THAT'S THE PREMISE OF YOUR QUESTION CAN COMPORT ME TOM I THINK WE HAVE ACHIEVED SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE TO BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IT DELIVERS A SPECIAL STATUS FOR BRITAIN IN THE E.U. WHERE WE HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS WE GET THE BENEFITS OF FREE TRADE WITHOUT THE COSTS OF THE EUROZONE WE GET THE BENEFITS OF FREE MOVEMENT AND TRAVEL WHILST AT THE SAME TIME DEALING WITH THE SOMETHING FOR NOTHING CULTURE IN WELFARE
WE GET THE SECURITY OF BEING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WITHOUT BEING TIED TO EVER CLOSER UNION SO WE'RE STRONGER SAY FROM BETTER OFF IN THE E.U. AND THE ALTERNATIVE IS A HUGE LEAP IN THE DARK WITH THE RISKS THAT THAT ENTAILS FOR OUR COUNTRY FOR ITS ECONOMY AND FOR OUR SECURITY BUT I GO BACK TO THE QUESTION WE'VE NOT REGAINED CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS WE HAD TO HAVE CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS
BECAUSE WE CAN DECIDE WHO CAN COME INTO THIS COUNTRY THAT'S WHY WE DON'T SEE THE BIG FLOWS OF SYRIAN MIGRANTS THAT YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE IN EUROPEAN AND WHEN HE COMES TO EUROPEAN UNION CITIZENS OF COURSE WE CHOOSE AS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO HAVE FREE MOVEMENT BUT AS A RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT LAST NIGHT
WE CAN WITHHOLD WELFARE PAYMENTS TO PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY SO THAT THOSE WHO COME IN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO OUR ECONOMY A CONTRIBUTION TO OUR TAX REVENUES BEFORE THEY TAKE OUT AND THAT IS NOT A CONTROL THAT'S AT BEST A DISINCENTIVE
I THINK IT ADDRESSES THIS THIS CONCERN THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD BRITAIN HAS BENEFITED FROM CONTROLLED MIGRATION WE'VE HAD DIFFERENT
PERIODS OF MIGRATION IN OUR HISTORY BUT WE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE COMING HERE JUST TO CLAIM A BENEFITS AND ACTUALLY UNDER DAVID CAMERON AND AS A RESULT OF THIS GOVERNMENT PEOPLE CANNOT COME HERE AND JUST CLAIM UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT WE'VE PUT A STOP TO THAT PEOPLE NOW CAN'T JUST COME HERE AND CLAIM THE IN WORK BENEFITS EITHER THEY HAVE TO WORK AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR EXCHEQUER LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY HAD BEFORE THEY CAN CLAIM THOSE WELFARE PAPERS
BY THE WAY JOHN EVEN YESTERDAY PEOPLE WERE SAYING ON PROGRAMMES LIKE THIS THESE THINGS WERE COMPLETELY UNACHIEVABLE THAT WE'D NEVER GET THIS KIND OF DEAL
IN EUROPE BUT WE'VE DELIVERED IT AND IT IS A SPECIAL STATUS FOR BRITAIN WE ARE NOT PART OF THE SINGLE CAROL ALL RIGHT LET'S NOT WITH EUROPEAN ARMY WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT PART OF THE COMMON BORDERS THAT GERMANY ANOTHER LEXI'S HAVE GET AWAY WE'RE NOT PART OF THAT EVER CLOSER UNION WHICH WAS SOMETHING WE SIGNED UP WITH ALL OF THOSE WE WILL WE WILL WE WILL COME TO ALL OF THAT IN A MOMENT BUT LET'S JUST STAY WITH THESE BENEFITS FOR A MOMENT YOU SILLY
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED BECAUSE THEY COME HERE FOR THE BENEFITS THE FACT IS MOST OF THEM DON'T AS YOU KNOW H.M.R.C. TOLD US ONLY SIXTEEN PERCENT OF MIGRANTS WHO ARRIVED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN CLAIM TAX CREDITS ONLY SIXTEEN PERCENT IT'S FORTY PERCENT OF NEWLY ARRIVED WHAT I'M QUOTING THE BOTTOM H.M. ARTHUR SEE HIS STATISTICS BUT THEY AT THE AGE OF A C. STATISTICS ARE THAT FORTY PERCENT OF NEWLY ARRIVED MIGRANTS
CLAIM IN WORK BENEFITS NOW AS A RESULT OF THIS AGREEMENT WE WILL BE ABLE TO WITHHOLD THOSE BENEFITS TO THE NEWLY ARRIVED MIGRANTS UNTIL TILL THEY MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO OUR ECONOMY WENT WITH WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE WANT TO END THAT SOMETHING THERE NOTHING CULTURE AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A STRAW MAN AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE LET ME GIVE YOU SIR STEVEN BECAUSE HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S FOREMOST EXPERT ON LABOUR MARKETS HE WAS ASKED AS YOU WILL KNOW
WHAT IMPACT THIS BAND THIS POOR YEAR BAN ON IN WORK BENEFITS WOULD HAVE HE SAID AND I QUOTE VERBATIM NOT MUCH BUT HERE SHE GOES ON TO SAY THAT THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MIGRATION FLOWS ARE AFFECTED BY THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INCOME AND BENEFITS YOU CAN RECEIVE IN THE TWO COUNTRIES THE ONE YOU'RE LEAVING THE ONE YOU'RE GOING TO THE JOHN CAN I MAKE A BROADER POINT WHICH IS THAT FOR THE WATER STAYING WITH THIS FOR A SEC I'VE JUST WAITED THIS BROUGHT TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOW YOU ME EVERYONE LISTENING TO THIS PROGRAMME
HAS A VOTE ON THIS VERY BIG DECISION ABOUT WHETHER WE WANT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH ALL THE RISKS THAT THAT INVOLVES THE LEAP IN THE DARK THAT INVOLVES ALL WE ARE CONTENT WITH THE SPECIAL STATUS THAT WE HAVE DELIVERED AS A RESULT OF THIS NEGOTIATION DOESN'T MEAN EVERYTHING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS PERFECT OF COURSE NOT DOES HE KNOW YOU'RE NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT I WAS SAYING IT ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON MAKING REFORMS TO KEEP OUR CONTINENT COMPETITIVE YES
BUT THE QUESTION WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GO INTO THAT BUT THAT BUT POLLING BOOTH LATER THIS YEAR AND YOU HAVE TO FACE THE DECISION YES OR NO REMAIN OR LEAVE
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE PLAN YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF RISK IN THAT ALTERNATIVE BUT WITH THE BEST WITH THE WILL WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME TO DO THAT OVER THE COMING MONTHS BUT WE HAD TAUGHT FOR A GREAT DEAL OF TIME MY BOAT THESE RE NEGOTIATIONS MY MISTER CAMERON PROMISED A GREAT DEAL FROM THEM WHAT I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU THIS MORNING ON THE BASIS OF WHAT WE NOW KNOW FOR THE FIRST TIME
IS THAT HE HASN'T ACHIEVED VERY MUCH HE WANTED NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS WHICH ARE AND I QUOTE HIM AND WILL REMAIN THE TRUE SOURCE OF REAL DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY HE HASN'T GOT THAT HE'S GOT A
VERY WEAK SYSTEM OF SO CALLED RED CARDS WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DISCUSSION AND NOT A VETO OF LEGISLATION FOR INSTANCE FIRST OF ALL FIRST NEW POWERS FOR NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS SECOND OFF FOR THE WHOLE OF US HOW THEY ARE THEY'LL PAT WAS FOR NO THEY CAN CALL FOR DEBATE THAT'S ABOUT IT THEY CAN BLOCK PROPOSALS COLLECTIVELY SECOND IF THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM SECOND CRUCIALLY THAT'S NOT A LOT OF LESLEY LET THE SOVEREIGNTY EXISTS
BECAUSE OF COURSE THE U.K. PARLIAMENT HOUSE OF COMMONS CAN VOTE TO WITHDRAW US FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND INDEED WE'RE GOING TO BE SETTING OUT THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS FURTHER THINGS WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAWS OF THE LAND ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS NO BECAUSE EUROPEAN LAW WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL OVER THAT'S A LOT YOU'RE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS REFERENDUM IS THAT WE DECIDE
OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE YOU DECIDED I DECIDED ON AN EVER ON A RENEGOTIATION YOU'LL SPIT OR GIVING US A DEAL AND THEN AND THEN THE COUNTRY MAKES THE DECISIONS ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT ABOUT ME OR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CABINET OR EVEN DARE I SAY IT YOU IT'S ABOUT THE COUNTRY MAKING DECISION ABOUT HIS FUTURE AND WE HAVE ADDRESSED THE MAJOR CONCERNS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD
ABOUT BRITAIN BEING ON A RATCHET HAVE EVER CLOSE BUT BRITAIN IS SOMEHOW GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE DECISIONS IMPOSED ON IT BY THE EUROZONE THE BRITAIN CAN'T MAKE SURE THAT MIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY BEFORE THEY GET WELFARE THAT THE E.U. ISN'T BEING COMPETITIVE ENOUGH ALREADY HAVE ADDRESSED THESE WHAT I'M IN THIS TO YOU IN THIS STATE YOU'LL HAVE GOT FOR THE
FOR THE U.K. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THEN LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO SUGGEST TO YOU IS THAT YOU SPECIFICALLY YOU HAVE NOT ADDRESSED THOSE ISSUES I REPEAT THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE CAN DO IS PREVAIL OVER AT NATIONAL OR YOUR OWN JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GOVE CAN'T HAVE THOUGHT MUCH OF THE PLANK AND GIVEN THAT HE'S GOING TO BE VOTING
TO TO STAY TO TALK TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT MICHAEL IS ONE OF THOSE CONSERVATIVES WHO HAS FOUGHT MANY DECADES WANTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO IN HER REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER DEAL WAS DELIVERED ONCE HE LEAVES THE ITEM I LIKE WHAT I COMPLETELY RESPECT
THAT VIEW I DON'T HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH IT AND I THINK WHAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WANT IS TO BE IN A REFORMED I THINK WITH DELIVERING THAT REFORM BUT LOOK LET ME SAY THIS AS A CONSERVATIVE ONE OF OUR GREAT CHALLENGES PEOPLE IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEWS IN THIS REFERENDUM IS THAT WE RESPECT PEOPLE'S OPINIONS WE HAVE A FAIR AND FREE DEBATE AND THEN AS AS CONSERVATIVES AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I WILL PARTICULARLY FOCUS ON
WE MAKE SURE AT THE END OF IT ALL WE CAN COME TOGETHER AS CONSERVATIVES TO BUILD THE STRONGER BRITAIN THAT WE BELIEVE IN AND TO KEEP JEREMY CORBIN AND AND AND WHAT I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU IS THAT MY GIRL WHO IS AFTER ALL THE JUSTICE SECRETARY KNOWING WHAT YOU HAVE AGREED IT IS NOT PERSUADED THAT OUR PARLIAMENT IS GOING TO BE SOVEREIGN IN THE WAY THAT YOU SUGGEST AND THAT MISTER CAMERON SPECIFICALLY PROMISED BUT IT'S THE SAME
MICHAEL LONG BEFORE YOU AS THE JUSTICE SECRETARY OR EVEN A MEMBER OF WILL DEAL WITH YOU WHEN HE WAS A JOURNALIST WAS WITH WRITING COLUMNS IN THE TIMES NEWSPAPER LOOK AT SAYING I DO I WANT BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE MAKING THE OBSERVATION JOHN THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ACTS FOR COULD BE RESPECT THIS VIEW WHO ALWAYS WANTED TO LEASE THE E.U. THEY WERE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T WANT US TO JOIN IN THE FIRST PLACE WHO VOTED NO IN THAT REFERENDUM IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND SO ON
AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE BY THE WAY WHO WOULD STAY WHATEVER THE PRICE I'VE GOT I THINK THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WANT TO REMAIN IN A REFORMED IF BRITAIN HAS THE SPECIAL STATUS WHICH WE HAVE SECURED AND THAT IS TO GO TOLD US THAT HE WERE THAT IF THE DEAL WAS RIGHT THEN HE WOULD RECONSIDER HIS POSITION WELL HE CLEARLY DOESN'T THINK THE DEAL IS RIGHT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT WERE PROMISED HAVE NOT BEEN EVER CLOSER UNION
YOU MAKE GREAT PLAY OF THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS MADE GREAT PLAY OF IT WHAT IS IT IN FACT WHAT IS THE PROMISE THAT WE'D RUNG FROM BRUSSELS IT IS IT'S BEEFED UP LANGUAGE AND THAT'S ABOUT IT ISN'T IT NO IT'S NOT IT'S A CHANGE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL TREATIES THAT UNDERPIN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT SAY THAT BRITAIN IS NO LONGER PART OF EVER CLOSER UNION AND WHAT I THINK IT MEANS
FOR ALL OF MY LIFE PRETTY MUCH BRITAIN HAS BEEN A RELUCTANT PARTNER IN THE PARTLY BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN COMMITTED TO THIS EVER CLOSER INTEGRATION AND BRITAIN'S BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND HOLDING IT BACK AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A QUESTION ABOUT WHERE SHE DIDN'T DO IT SO WE STAYED OUT OF THE EURO FOR INSTANCE SUCCESSIVE PRIME MINISTERS LIKE MARGARET THATCHER AND JOHN MAJOR HAVE KEPT US OUT OF THINGS LIKE THE EURO AND THE SINGLE BORDERS
BUT WE ALWAYS FACE WITH THIS CHOICE WHICH IS DO YOU AGREE TO THIS LATEST PIECE OF INTEGRATION WHAT DAVID CAMERON HAS ACHIEVED THAT NO BRITISH PRIME MINISTER HAS PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVES HIS IS BRITAIN IS NO LONGER COMMITTED TO THAT INTEGRATION WE'RE NO LONGER COMMITTED TO THE EVER CLOSER EUROPEAN UNION THE EUROPEAN SUPERSTATE AND AS A RESULT I THINK WE HAVE A MUCH MORE BUT TALK ABOUT A SUPER STATE IN WELL RUB HAPPENS A LOT IN FACT IN THERE NOT LEAST NOT LEAST FROM THOSE WHO ARGUE WE SHOULD LEAVE BUT WE ARE NOT
WE'RE NOT PART OF IT NOW AND I THINK THAT'S A FUNDAMENTALLY MORE COMFORTABLE POSITION FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM THIS MORNING IF HE MEANS WE ARE NOT UNDER CONSTANT PRESSURE TO SIGN UP TO MORE POLITICAL ECONOMIC BUDGETARY UNION WE CAN HAVE THAT SPECIAL STATUS WHERE WE ARE IN THE SINGLE MARKET WE CAN TRADE WITH A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMY FREELY AND WE'RE NOT AT THE SAME TIME HAVING TO BEAR THE COSTS OF THE YEAR WHERE WE GET THE FREE MOVEMENT TO TRAVEL TO WORK IN EUROPE
BUT AS I SAY WE WE CAN IMPOSE DISCUSSED GET LOOK AT ME A SINGLE LAW CURRENT LAW THAT WOULD APPLY TO US DIFFERENTLY TODAY BECAUSE OF THIS WORDING ABOUT THE EVER CLOSER UNION THAT WE HAD NO ONE
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD EXAMPLES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO CONSENTS TO VARIOUS EUROZONE ARRANGEMENTS BECAUSE OF HOW THEY'VE BEEN PUT TOGETHER UNDER EXISTING RULES AS IT WAS UP WHICH WELL FOR EXAMPLE THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK WAS GOING TO ALLOW CERTAIN COUNTRIES COMPANIES TO MOVE OUT OF THE U.K. IMPORTANT BUSINESSES FOR THE U.K.
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T IN THE EURO AS A RESULT OF LAST NIGHT'S AGREEMENT THAT CAN'T HAPPEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO COME AS WE HAVE THE PIECE OF HAS IT COME ON THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO WHAT WE WHAT EXACTLY FUNDAMENTAL TO WHAT I WANT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS THAT OUR BUSINESSES CURTAIN TRADE WHEREVER THAT WE CAN LOCATE HERE IN THE U.K. AND DO BUSINESS WITH A WE DON'T HAVE A VETO
BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WE HAVE SECURED IN THAT PART OF THE AGREEMENT IS A SET OF PRINCIPLES WRITTEN INTO EXACTLY DISEASE THERE CAN BE ENFORCED BY THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS AND THE EUROPEAN COURT AND INDEED CRUCIALLY SOMETHING AGAIN PEOPLE THOUGHT WE'D NEVER GET THIS THIS EMERGENCY BRAKE IN THIS RESPECT WHERE WE CAN SAY
IF WE DON'T AGREE WITH THIS WE'RE TAKING IT TO THE EUROPEAN AND THEN WE COULD BE VOTED WE'VE LEARNT IN THE LAST TWO DAYS YOU DO NEED A CONSENSUS AT THE COUNCIL RIGHT THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU WERE ALL THOSE STORIES ABOUT YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY THE GREEK
PRIME MINISTER OR THE POLISH PRIME MINISTER ONE OF HER BEING ABLE TO HOLD THE WHOLE THING UP THAT CAN BE THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER IF IT'S SOMETHING NOW THAT THREATENS OUR FUNDAMENTAL INTEREST AS A COUNTRY IT'S A MAJOR ECONOMY IN EUROPE BUT NOT REASSURING THE CITY TOO MUCH BUT LOOK AT THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT TREATY CHANGE IRREVERSIBLE WE ARE TILL THESE CHANGES THAT THAT MISTER CAMERON HAS ONE BUT
THEY ARE NOT THEY ARE SIMPLY NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AS IT WERE AUTHORISED APPROVED BY TREATY CHANGE AND WHEN IF THAT TREATY CHANGE DOES COME ABOUT THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT INCLUDE THESE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO BE IN IT IT COULDN'T BE VETOED THAT IS NOTHING IRREVERSIBLE ABOUT THIS AT ALL WELL WE HAVE A LEGALLY BINDING
IRREVERSIBLE COMMITMENT FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TREATY LEADERS IF HE'S DEAD I DON'T KNOW IT'S A TREATY DEPOSITED AT THE UNITED NATIONS BY THE WAY THIS IS EXACTLY THE PROCEDURE THAT OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE IRELAND AND USED IN THE PAST AND THEN AT THE NEXT TREATED CHANGE WE GET THESE THINGS ARE WRITTEN INTO THE TREATIES OF THE EUROPE UNLESS HE'S A VETO
AS I SAY CHANGE THAT IF I LOSE BECAUSE CHANGE THEIR LEADERS CAN CHANGE BUT THE LEGAL AGREEMENT REMAINS IT'S NOT BETWEEN LEADERS IT'S BETWEEN DIFFERENT WITH THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE GOT ISN'T IT ON BORN BUT NOT A LEGALLY BINDING
TREATING YOU CAN'T FIND ANYONE ON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE OF ANY SERIOUS AUTHORITY WHO SAYS THAT THEIR COUNTRIES ARE NOT NOW BOUND TO GET THESE THINGS INTO THE TREATIES ARE OF THE OPINION BUT LOOK IT'S A BIG QUESTION FACING OUR COUNTRY NOW ABSOLUTELY WE DO WE DO WE REMAIN IN THIS ARRANGEMENT
THAT PROTECTS OUR JOBS PROTECTS OUR SECURITY OF COURSE HAS ITS FAULTS AND CAN BE IMPROVED BUT HAS UNDERTAKEN BIG IMPROVEMENTS WITH THIS AGREEMENT
OR DO WE LEAVE DO WE GO FOR THAT LEAP IN THE DARK WITH ALL THAT RISK NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC SECURITY AND THAT IS THE QUESTION EVERYONE LISTENING TO THIS PROGRAMME IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO YOUR SIDE ON AND YOUR PROBLEM MINISTERS CHANCELLORS SECONDS MOST SENIOR PERSON IN THE GOVERNMENT PERHAPS AND MISTER CAMERON HIMSELF
IS YOU ARE GOING TO FAILED TO PERSUADE WE KNOW THAT NOW IT WAS A FACT A NUMBER OF VERY SENIOR FIGURES IN THE CABINET THAT SAYS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT IT NOT JUST ABOUT THE OUTCOME PERHAPS BUT THE BOAT MY CAMERON'S LEADERSHIP UNDER POLITICAL DANGERS INHERENT IN ALL OF THIS I THINK IT SAYS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT DAVID CAMERON'S LEADERSHIP THAT HE CAN ALLOW INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE CABINET I THINK IT WILL BE A MINORITY
TO CAMPAIGN IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY FOR LEAVING AND HE IS RELAXED ABOUT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FREE AND FAIR DEBATE IT'S A DEMOCRACY WE'RE GIVING PEOPLE THE CHOICE NONE OF THOSE THINGS HAVE EVER HAPPENED UNDER A RECENT PRIME MINISTER AND I THINK IT SHOWS THAT THIS IS A GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO BRITAIN'S NATIONAL INTEREST TO BRITAIN'S DEMOCRACY
AND TO BRITAIN'S PLACE IN A STRONGER SAFER AND BETTER OUR BOWLING TO GIVE YOU TEN SECONDS TO MAKE A PERSONAL APPEAL TO YEAR OLD FRIEND BORIS JOHNSON TO COME OUT TODAY AND SAY DAVE GEORGE I'M WITH YOU
BORIS WILL MAKE HIS OWN DECISION LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IN THE COUNTRY THE GREAT THING IS THE BORIS AND I WE EACH HAVE ONE VOTE IN THIS CONTEST AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LISTENING WHO CAN MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND THEY HAVE AN EQUAL VOTE
CHANCELLOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THEY ARE UNIMPRESSED WITH THE DEED AGREED IN BRUSSELS LAST NIGHT THE EDITORIAL IN THE TIMES SETS THE GENERAL TONE FROM THE LAND OF CHOCOLATE IT SUGGEST DAVID CAMERON WAS ALWAYS DESTINED TO BRING BACK FUDGE IT CLAIMS THE AGREED REFORMS ARE NOWHERE NEAR WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER PLEDGED AND SAYS HE NOW HAS LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO CLAIM THAT BRITISH INTERESTS ARE BEST SERVED BY TRYING TO REFORM EUROPE FROM THE INSIDE MAKING THE ARGUMENT THE EDITORIAL CONCLUDES WILL BE AN UPHILL STRUGGLE
THE TAIL LEE THE TELEGRAPH THINKS TO LABOUR NEGOTIATIONS HIGH LIKE THE FEELINGS OF THE E.U. THERE IS IT ARGUES NO BETTER WAY TO JUDGE ITS HEALTH AND THE ARTHRITIC WEIRD HANDLED POLITE REQUESTS FOR CHANGE THE MALE'S EDITORIAL THAT SUGGESTING WE HAVE SEEN A BODY INSTITUTIONALLY INCAPABLE OF REFORM IS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE CONCESSIONS AND SEEDED BY THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS THERE'S A CHASM BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES PROMISED AND THE PATHETIC COMPROMISE
ON A COMPROMISE HE HAS STRUGGLED TO CLINCH THIS WEEK HEALTH SERVICE CHAOS AS THE LEAD STORY FOR THE DAILY MIRROR WHICH SAYS A PREDICTOR DEFICIT OF THREE BILLION POUNDS BY THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR MEANS THE N.H.S. FACES THE WORST CASH CRISIS IN ITS HISTORY THE PAPER'S EDITORIALS SAVAGES THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT ACCUSING HIM OF PURSUING HIS GOAL OF A SEVEN DAY N. H. S. WITH THE FOLLY OF SOMEONE
WHO BUILT AN EXTENSION WHEN THEIR HOUSE IS IN DANGER OF COLLAPSE THE CHARGE SHEET AGAINST MY HUNTED SAYS GROWS LONGER WITH EACH DAY AND AN R. S. P. BE WARNING VET NOVELTY NEST OF BOXES IN UNUSUAL COLOURS AND DESIGNS COULD BE DANGEROUS FOR BIRDS THAT IN THE TELEGRAPH AND THE GUARDIAN AND CALLED IN THE TELEGRAPH BRIGHT COLOURS COULD ATTRACT PREDATORS
POOR DESIGNS MAY THE RESIDENTS AT RISK OF COLD DAMP OR OVERHEATING THE GUARDIAN KNOWS THAT THE IDEAL NEST BOX HAS A V. SHAPED ROOF IT'S WATERPROOFED PERCH FREE AND HAS THE RIGHT SIZE HOLE TO KEEP PREDATORS OUT AND PRESUMABLY LET BAZ
THE TIME WAS TEN TO NINE APPLES ROW WITH THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OVER THE UNLOCKING OF THE I. PHONE BELONGING TO THE SAN BERNARDINO GUNMAN IT GOES TO COURT NEXT MONTH WITH THE GOVERNMENT ACCUSING IT OF PUTTING ITS MARKETING BEFORE THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM APART FROM THAT APPLE HAS A NEW OPPONENT TO CONTEND WITH
AND I'M SAYING I WANT APPLE FIRST OF ALL HAVE A LOT TO GIVE THE SECURITY FOR THEIR PONY OH KAY
WHAT I THINK YOU WANT TO DO IS BOY CARD APPLE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY GIVE THEIR SECURITY NUMBER HOW DO YOU LIKE I JUST THOUGHT IT BOY CHILD APPLE DONALD TRUMP WEIGHING INTO THE DEBATE WE'RE JOIN UP FROM EDINBURGH BY THE TECHNOLOGY JOURNALIST RUPERT GOODWIN'S GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING IS THIS GOING TO HURT UP
I DON'T THINK SO I THINK THE OVERLAP BETWEEN TRUMP SUPPORTERS NAP OWNERS IS FAIRLY LIMITED AND ANYONE WHO THINKS AMERICANS DON'T R. AND A. SHOULD NOTE THAT TRUMP HAS BEEN TWEETING FROM HIS PHONE SINCE THEY WERE SO PERHAPS HE SHOULD BE TAKEN TOO SERIOUSLY OR THERE'S A BIGGER ISSUE FOR FOUR APPLE THEN IS THE FACT THAT IT'S NOW GOING TO COURT WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE HOW DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE RESOLVED
THIS IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION THE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN USING IT A TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD LAW TO FORCE APPLE TO BREAK THE ENCRYPTION ON THIS PARTICULAR I PHONE IT'S NOT BY INSTALLING A BACK DOOR ONTO ALL I PHONES BUT IT'S MAKING AN APPLE WILL DO THE WORK TO BREAK INTO ANY A DEVICE ON THE SAY SO THE GOVERNMENT MAP ON SAYING THAT THEY CAN'T DO THAT SO
A LOT OF CHANGING MY MESSAGE IT'S TO PUT ITS DEFINING THE LIMITS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND COMPANY RIGHT SOME GOVERNMENT WRITES IN THE AREA OF ENCRYPTION AND APPLE SAY A TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD LAW IS NOT REALLY THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WHICH IS THE LAW
IT'S THE RITZ ACT WHICH IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT WANTS YOU TO CARRY OUT A WRIT THAT SOME FORM OF ACTION YOU MUST DO IT UNLESS CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS ARE MET AND IT'S A VERY GENERAL PURPOSE ACT
AND IT'S USED IN GENERAL WHERE THERE THERE'S NO EXISTING LEGISLATION COVERING THE CASE AND THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT IT ARE THEY BECAUSE ONCE THE DUSTER SPOT WAS TALKING ABOUT PUTTING MOCK APPLE PUTTING MARKETING BEFORE THAT ESSENTIALLY THE SECURITY OF THE NATION THAT THAT IS THAT IS QUITE A HIGH STAKES ARGUMENT TO PUT FORWARD
IT IS AN APPLE SAYING NO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS APPLE IS AS IT IS PRESENTING ITS USERS WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SAFETY AND IF THEY CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TOLD THEM TURN IT OFF THEN THEY'RE SUFFERING FROM IT AND THE USE OF THEMSELVES ARE SUFFERING I DON'T HAVE THE BITTER THE PROTECTION IT'S NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT THAT APPLE AND SAYING TO DO THIS IF THEY ARE FORCED TO BREAK SECURITY ON PRODUCTS
BLUE AND THE OTHER OTHER USERS CAN GET THROUGH THAT SORT OF REDUCED ENCRYPTION PEOPLE LIKE OTHER GOVERNMENTS OR CRIMINALS SO APPLE SAYING WE CAN'T GIVE USERS WHAT THEY WANT IF THIS LAWS IN PLACE THERE'S NO SORT OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES ARE EXCEPTIONAL ROUTE THEY COULD USE IN FOR EXAMPLE ON THIS PARTICULAR I PHONE WITHOUT ESSENTIALLY OPENING UP AN ENCRYPTION ALTOGETHER
OH NO THIS IS JUST THE TEST CASE THIS IS THIS IS DEFINITELY ABOUT THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR I PHONE BUT IT'S LITTLE USE OF LORD SIR PRESIDENTS THAT APPLE IS HE'S FIGHTING AND WE'VE GOT THE SAME DECISION TO MAKE EVER HERE GOES THE INVESTIGATORY POWERS BILL THAT'S GOING TO AT SOME POINT TURN UP IN THE U.K. AND THE WHITE PAPER THAT IS VERY FUZZY AROUND THESE ISSUES AND HAVE ME MUCH DEBATE SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE IN THE WEST
WITH A GOOD GOODWIN'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES TO NINE AFTER THE CABINET MEETING THAT BEGINS IN AN HOUR'S TIME DAVID CAMERON WILL ANNOUNCE THE DATE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE FIRST TIME MANY OF US WILL HAVE A SAY ON BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP FIRST THOUGH THE PRIME MINISTER WILL FORMALLY PUT THE DEAL TO HIS CLOSEST COLLEAGUES A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA COULDN'T SPARE JOINS US LAURA YOU'LL HAVE HER GEORGE OSBORNE IN A MOMENT TO GO
SAYING THAT VOTING TO REMAIN AS ESSENTIALLY THE SAFER OPTION INDEED AND I THINK FROM THAT INTERVIEW WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR IDEA OF HOW HE AND THE PRIME MINISTER AND THEIR SUPPORTERS IN THIS DEBATE INTEND TO MAKE THEIR CAMPAIGN I THINK IF YOU HAD EVEN ONE PENNY FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES WILL HEAR THEM SAY SPECIAL STATUS AND BEST OF BOTH WORLDS YOU'D BEEN MASSIVELY QUIDS IN BY JUNE TWENTY THIRD WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF FOCUS HER PRESENTATION OF SOME KIND OF TRIUMPH ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE U.K. WILL BE ABLE TO
RESTRICT BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO E.U. MIGRANTS FOR SEVEN YEARS DIFFERENT TO THEIR MANIFESTO COMMITMENT THAT OF COURSE WAS A FOUR YEAR TOTAL BAN BUT THEY WILL GO ON AND ON AT EXPECT ABOUT THOSE RESTRICTIONS THERE BUT ON THE FUNDAMENTALS THAT JOHN HAS PRESSING HIM ON THE ACTIONS THAT CAN BE ASSURED TO CUT DRASTICALLY THE LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION THOSE ARE NOT PART OF THIS DEAL WILL THEY BE ABLE TO GUARANTEE THERE ARE LAWS WILL NEVER BE A RETURN BY EUROPEAN COURTS NO THEY WILL NOT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO IT
QUESTIONING OF THEIR ARGUMENTS WILL COME TO THEIR DEFENCE THAT TO VOTE TO LEAVE IS A LEAP IN THE DARK TO USE THE CHANCELLOR'S PHRASE IN THAT FOR THEM IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO IN TERMS OF QUESTIONING OF THE ARGUMENTS WITHIN THE CABINET THE CHANCELLOR SAID HE WAS RELAXED ABOUT MORE THAN THE PRIME MINISTER WAS VERY RELAXED ABOUT THE IDEA OF CABINET MEMBERS INCLUDING MICHAEL GO CAMPAIGNING ON THE OTHER SIDE I THINK RELAXED MIGHT PERHAPS BE AS SO LIGHTLY
SMART WAY OF SMILING ON IT A LITTLE BIT I THINK THAT THEY KNOW THIS IS COMING DAVID CAMERON KNEW WHEN HE TOOK THE GAMBLE OF HOLDING THIS REFERENDUM IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT HE WASN'T JUST TAKING A RISK WITH BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HE WAS ALSO TAKING THE RISK OF DIVIDING HIS PARTY THE REASON IT HAS BEEN SO CAREFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED WITH CABINET MINISTERS BEING GIVEN THIS SPECIAL PASSED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUT TO SPENDING COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY IS PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THAT RISK OF SPLITTING THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN SO DIVIDED ON EUROPE
WE ARE LOOKING AT AROUND SIX CABINET MINISTERS POTENTIALLY DISAGREEING WITH HIM AROUND THE TABLE THIS MORNING ONE OF THEM WHO WILL NOT BE THERE BORIS JOHNSON THE LONDON MAYOR BECAUSE HE IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE FULL CABINET BUT ATTENDS POLITICAL CABINET HE PERHAPS RATHER CONVENIENTLY ACTUALLY WON'T BE THERE THIS MORNING AND I'M NOT EXPECTING THAT WILL HEAR HIS DECISION THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DAY
BUT MICHAEL GO FOR IAIN DUNCAN SMITH CHRIS GRAYLING TERESA VILLA'S PROBABLY THE NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY JOHN WETTING DALE THE CUNT THE CULTURE SECRETARY WE COULD GO ON AND ON THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A MAJORITY OF SENIOR CONSERVATIVES BUT A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK SOME OF THEM WITH BIG VOICES AND THIS IS ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MORE IMPORTANTLY ABOUT THE PUBLIC BUT DAVID KAREN HAS TAKEN A RISK WITH BOTH LAURA THANK YOU WILL AS FAR AS MICHAEL GO FOR IS CONCERNED AS FAR BACK AS TWENTY THIRTEEN HE MADE IT CLEAR ON THE ANDREW MARR SHOW THAT HE COULD COUNTENANCE LIFE OUTSIDE THE E.U.
MY IDEAL IS EXACTLY WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC SIDE IS WHICH TO RECOGNISE THE CURRENT SITUATION IS HE'S NO GOOD TO SAY THAT LIFE OUTSIDE WOULD BE PERFECT
TOLERABLE WE COULD CONTEMPLATE IT THERE WILL BE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES BUT THE BEST DEAL FOR EUROPE AND FOR BRITAIN WOULD BE IF BRITAIN WERE TO LEAVE THE CHANGE THAT EUROPE NEEDS WELL THAT WAS MICHAEL GAVE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE'RE JOINED NOW BY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HIM WELL THE GUARDIAN COLUMNIST MATTHEW DON'T CONE OR GOOD MORNING MORNING GEORGE OSBORNE WAS
WAS SAYING A MOMENT AGO ESSENTIALLY THAT THAT MICHAEL GO WAS ALWAYS GOING TO FAVOUR LEAVE IS THAT REALLY THE CASE I'M NOT SURE HE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO FAVOUR LEAVE BECAUSE HE WAS TORN BETWEEN PERSONAL LOYALTY AND CONVICTION HE'S SOMEONE WHO IS VERY CLOSE TO CAMERA NOT ONLY AS A POLITICAL LIEUTENANT BUT AS A SOCIAL FRIEND
ON THE NIGHT OF THE TWO THOUSAND TEN ELECTION THE GO FAMILY LOOKED AFTER CAMERON CHILDREN IT THAT KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP SO FOR HIM TO DO THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF CAMERON'S GREATEST GAMBLE IS A MAJOR STEP AND THENCE AND HE HAS TO WORK I WAS AWARE THAT THIS IS A CONSIDERABLE GAME
RESORTING TO STAR TURNS BY GEORGE GALLOWAY AND SO ON TO GET TO GET GO VON SIDE IS PHILIP TAYLOR UM IT CERTAINLY IS BECAUSE EFFECTIVELY WHAT HE IS SAYING IS THAT ON SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS AS MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE PRIME MINISTER'S JUDGEMENT THAT THIS IS THE BEST FOR BRITAIN IS WRONG THAT'S RIGHT AND IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE CAPTURES HIS HIS SUPPORT FOR BRIGGS IT BECAUSE THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF WAYS ARE DOING AT THE THE THE THE MANNER IN WHICH IT'S BEEN DONE BY
PEOPLE LIKE NIGEL FARRAJ NINE PATTERSON HAS BEEN TO POUR SCORN UPON THE PRIME MINISTER WILL GO WILL BE VERY KEEN TO AVOID THAT AND I'M SURE HE'LL PREFACE ALL HIS REMARKS WITH POLITE REMARKS ABOUT HOW WONDERFUL A PRIME MINISTER CAMERON HIS PAIN BUT THIS IS THE BIG TEST OF HIS PREMIERSHIP PAYS TRYING TO REFORM THE E.U. SO THAT IT'S BETTER FOR BRITAIN AND HE BELIEVES THAT THIS DEAL IS THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THAT AND YOU KNOW ONE OF HIS CLOSEST POLITICAL ALLIES
HE'S GOING TO STAND UP THIS WEEKEND PRESUMABLY AND SAY NO IT DOESN'T DO THAT IT DOESN'T ACHIEVE WHAT WE WANT TO TO TO TO GET FILM WHEN YOU SAY HE MICHAEL GO HE'S GOING TO COUCH IT CAREFULLY DOES THAT MEAN THAT HE MAY NOT PLAY A VERY ACTIVE ROLE IN THE LEAF CAMPAIGN WELL THAT'S WHAT HE'S GOT TO DECIDE THAT'S THE NEXT DILEMMA THAT FACES HIM HAVING GONE THROUGH THE SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO DILEMMA IS
WE'LL HEAT WILL YOU TAKE UP THE POSITION OF LEADING IF NOT OFFICIALLY THEN BUT IN PRACTICE THE LEAF CAMPAIGN MY HUNCH IS THAT IN FACT HIS SUPPORT HIS DECISION TO COME OUT AND BACK LEAVE IS IS GOING TO GIVE COVER TO OTHER CABINET MINISTERS AND PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
IN THE CABIN AND BORIS JOHNSON IT'S AN INVITATION TO THEM TO TAKE AS GEOFFREY HOWE'S RESIGNATION WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY TO MICHAEL HESELTINE I DON'T THINK THEY WILL END UP AS THE LEADER OF THE LEAF CAMPAIGN MATTHEW DON'T KOHNER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT IS IT FROM US OUR EDITORS WERE ANDREW BRYCE DAN KELLY COMING UP THE SLOTH APPRECIATION SOCIETY IN SATURDAY DELIGHT GOOD MORNING
THE YARD'S PROGRAMME WITH PLENTY OF FRONT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY SELF REFERENTIAL AND PLAYFUL FILM IT'S NOT HIS BEST WORK IT'S GOOD BUT NOT BRILLIANT WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE FIND KIND OF NORMAL AND DOMESTIC YOU MANAGED TO CHANGE INTO BEING SOMETHING SORT OF WEIRD THROUGH REAL AND VAGUELY THREATENING THAT WAS MY OWN VERY GLAD HE FELT
