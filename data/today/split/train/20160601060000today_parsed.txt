THAT IS READ BY NEIL SLATE A CORONER WILL ANNOUNCE LATER TODAY WHETHER SHE'LL RESUME INQUEST INTO THE DEATHS OF THE TWENTY ONE PEOPLE IN THE BIRMINGHAM PUB BOMBINGS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WIDELY THOUGHT TO BE THE WORK OF THE I.R.A. THE ORIGINAL HEARING WAS ADJOURNED A YEAR LATER WHEN SIX MEN WERE CONVICTED THE MEN WERE ACQUITTED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE

CAMPAIGNERS WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE YOU WERE CALLING FOR BIG CHANGES TO THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IF BRITAIN VOTES FOR BREAKS IT THEY SAY THE AUTOMATIC RIGHT OF E.U. CITIZENS TO WORK HERE WILL END AND THE POINTS BASED SCHEME SIMILAR TO THAT USED IN AUSTRALIA WHAT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED THE T.U.C. WHICH SUPPORTS THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS WARNED THAT MANUFACTURING JOBS WOULD GO AND WAGES WOULD FALL IN THE LONG TERM IF BRITAIN LEAVES OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT BEN WRITE REPORTS

THE COST TO KENT ECONOMY WAS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION POUNDS ON EACH OF THE THIRTY ONE DAYS THAT OPERATION STACK WAS ENFORCE THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED BY COMMITTING MILLIONS OF POUNDS TO BUILD A LORRY PARK THE SIZE OF DISNEYLAND NEAR THE MOTORWAY
TODAY'S REPORT SAYS THE RISKS ARE SPENDING SUCH LARGE SUMS QUICKLY APPEARS TO HAVE LEFT SOME OF THE USUAL BEST PRACTICE BEHIND IT URGES THE GOVERNMENT TO EXAMINE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS AND DEMONSTRATE THE LORRY PARKS NECESSITY BEFORE GOING AHEAD

THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES PAST SIX ERM JOHN HAMMOND IS AT THE WEATHER CENTRE MORNING JOHN HELLO JOHN WELL IT'S THE FIRST OF JUNE AND FOR SOME OF US SOME SUMMER SUNSHINE TO ENJOY FOR OTHERS IT FEELS MORE LIKE WINTER AND FOR MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES THE LATTER APPLIES A GREY DAMP AND CHILLY THROUGH THIS MORNING THERE'S A DRIZZLY RAIN QUITE WIDESPREAD ACROSS THE HEART OF ENGLAND SPREADING ITS WAY WESTWARDS INTO
PARTS OF WALES TO LOOK NOT AMOUNTING TO MUCH BUT A BIT OF A NUISANCE TO BE HEADING OUT NEXT TO A COUPLE OF HOURS SOME HILL FOG AROUND TOO THERE WILL BE SOME DRIER SPELLS BUT PRECIOUS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF SUNSHINE AND THE RISK OF SOME HEAVY AND THUNDERY DOWNPOURS SPREADING ACROSS THE NEAR CONTINENT INTO PARTS OF EASTERN AND SOUTHERN ENGLAND AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY SO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT
HOWEVER WESTERN FRINGES OF ENGLAND AND WALES AND THAT'S PRIMARILY CORNWALL AND WEST WALES HERE WILL SEE SOME SUNSHINE IT WILL BE A GOOD DEAL WARMER HERE APPROACHING TWENTY DEGREES BUT UNDERNEATH THAT GREY CLOUDY WEATHER FURTHER EAST ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES THE MID TEENS IS THE BEST I CAN OFFER YOU WITH THAT BRISK NORTH EASTERLY WIND
FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND IN CONTRAST PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TO LOOK FORWARD TO REACH TWENTY FOUR DEGREES IN GLASGOW YESTERDAY WON'T BE FAR OFF AGAIN TODAY UP INTO THE LOW TWENTIES QUITE WIDELY WHERE WE SEE THE SUNSHINE THAT'S ACROSS THE MORE CENTRAL AND WESTERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND MUCH OF NORTHERN IRELAND A FINE SUMMER'S DAY
THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND THOUGH AND DOWN ACROSS THE EAST COAST AND TOWARDS EAST LOTHIAN AND THE BORDERS RATHER MORE CLOUD HERE WITH THAT BREEZE RESTRICTING TEMPERATURES TO THE MID TEENS BUT BY AND LARGE THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE TODAY FOR SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND CLOUDIER AND COOLER FOR ENGLAND AND WALES I'LL BE BACK IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
THEY WERE MUCH LOVED THAT TO LET US HAVE A LOOK NOW AT THE PAPERS AT SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND THE FRONT PAGE IS QUITE A FEW OF THEM DOMINATED BY WHAT VOTE LEAVE ARE GOING TO BE SAYING TODAY ABOUT IMMIGRATION FOR IT WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR AN IMMIGRATION REVOLUTION SLASH NUMBERS ARRIVING FROM THE E.U. LEADING OUT CAMPAIGNERS PLEDGED TODAY IT'S ACROSS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MAIL IMMIGRATION REVOLUTION IF WE IMPLEMENT THESE PRINCIPLES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A GENERATION IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR POLITICIANS TO KEEP THEIR PROMISES
ON IMMIGRATION ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT THAT WON'T LEAVE HAVE ISSUED ALREADY IN THERE SOME SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE ON IT BUT THEY'VE GOT A PICTURE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF LARGE CAR FOUR BY FOUR WITH A BOAT ON A TRAILER ON THE BACK THE SUN SAYS ITS OWN INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED A CRIMINAL GANG IS CHARGING ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS
HER BOAT TO SMUGGLE MIGRANTS ACROSS THE CHANNEL IT'S BELIEVED THAT THE EIGHTEEN ALBANIANS RESCUED IN THE CHANNEL RECENTLY WELL WHY IN ONE OF THESE BOATS AND THE SON SAYS HUNDREDS MORE MIGRANTS MAY ALREADY HAVE SNEAKED IN GUARDIAN LEAVES WITH A STORY THAT SAYS BRITAIN'S INVOLVEMENT IN CONTROVERSIAL AND CLAN DESK DINE RENDITION OPERATIONS PROVOKED AN UNPRECEDENTED ROW BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND A FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES US M.I.FIVE AND M.I.SIX AT THE HEIGHT OF THE WAR ON TERROR
THE HEAD OF M.I.FIVE ELIZABETH MANNING ELIZA RATHER MANNINGHAM BULLER WAS SO ANGRY ABOUT IT WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THE ROLE BEING PLAYED BY M.I.SIX IN ABDUCTIONS THAT LED TO SUSPECTED EXTREMIST BEING TORTURED THAT SHE THREW OUT OF HER OFFICE IS A NUMBER OF HER SISTER AGENCY STAFF AND BANNED THEM FROM WORKING AT THE M.I.FIVE HEADQUARTERS
THE TIMES HAS THE STORY OF JEREMY CORBIN SPIN DOCTOR ACCUSING LABOUR STAFF OF LEAKING PRIME MINISTER QUESTION LINES OF ATTACK GERMAN CORBIN'S MOST SENIOR ADVISER IS ACCUSE LABOUR'S OWN STAFF OR TIME SAYS HER LOSS OF LEAKING THE QUESTIONS THAT THE PARTY LEADER PLANS TO ASK DAVID CAMERON IN PARLIAMENT IN A SIGN THE PAPER SAYS OF THE PARANOIA AT THE TOP OF LABOUR SEAMUS MEL SAID THE LINE OF QUESTIONING PREPARE BANNISTER CORBIN AND HIS TEAM BEFORE PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS WAS LATE A THIRD OF THE TIME
THIS IS ALL IN A FLY ON THE WALL DOCUMENTARY WHICH IS GONNA PUT ON LINE TODAY MISTER COOGAN ALSO KIDS IS THE B. B. C. MISSED CALL HIMSELF A CHICK IS THE B. B. C. OF BEING OBSESSED WITH TRYING TO DAMAGE THE LEADERSHIP OF LABOUR
THE GOOD NEWS STORY OF THE DAY IN THE PAPERS IS THAT LICENCE BUT I SAID GOING TO DROP CANNED MUSIC FROM PIPED MUSIC IF WE PREFER FROM THEIR SHOPS HOW ABOUT THAT COULD THIS BE THE START OF A REAL MOVEMENT TO GET RID OF THE HORRIBLE STUFF MAYBE MAYBE THEY SHOULD STICK WHERE IN JUNE ARMY DURING THE FIRST HE'S HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT CANNED CAROLS FOR CHRISTMAS AND THE CANNED CAROL WE NOT REQUIRED TO BE IMPARTIAL ABOUT MEWSER
NO OTHER PAINTER LOOKING LIKE THEM IT IS TEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TURN TO OTHER MATTERS SERIOUS MATTERS ABOUT HEALTH WORRYING MATTERS ABOUT HEALTH PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO EITHER HAVE MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE OR WHO HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS WHO HAVE IT BECAUSE THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT DOCTORS ARE MISSING THE SYMPTOMS OF MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE AND THAT THAT
REALLY MATTERS FOR THE EARLY TREATMENT NOT OF THE DISEASE ITSELF HE CAN'T BE TREATED BUT OF THE SYMPTOMS ARE HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ALAN BREMEN IS ON THE LINE WHAT ARE THE SENTENCE ADAM THAT PEOPLE ARE MISSING WHEN THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE SYMPTOMS OVERLAP WITH A LOT OF OTHER CONDITIONS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING TROUBLE INITIALLY A LEASING IN TERMS OF GRIPPING OR WALKING OR SPEAKING SWALLOWING OR BREATHING SO DOCTORS VERY OFTEN INVESTIGATE OTHER THINGS SUCH AS A TRAPPED NERVE OR OR TYPE TWO DIABETES OR STROKE OR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
A BRAIN TUMOUR AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS TO RULE OUT BEFORE THEY THEY MIGHT CONSIDER MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE AND THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM REALLY IN TERMS OF THE UNCERTAINTY AND DELAYS TO HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE TYPES OF SYMPTOMS
FACE BEFORE THEY GET A REFERRAL TO A NEUROLOGIST WHO CAN CARRY OUT THE DIAGNOSIS AND SO IN THIS SURVEY A VERY DETAILED SURVEY THAT'S BEEN CARRIED OUT WITH RESPONSES FROM NEARLY A THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT'S NEARLY A THIRD OF THOSE WHO ARE CONTACTED ALL THESE PEOPLE ONE IN FIVE HAD TO WAIT AT LEAST A YEAR TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST OFF THEIR FIRST VISIT WITH SYMPTOMS TO THE G.P. AND TWO OUT OF FIVE
WENT TO THE G.P. AT LEAST THREE TIMES BEFORE THERE WAS EVEN MENTION OF REFERRAL SO THAT MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE ASSOCIATION SAYS G.P.S DO NEED TO BE MORE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THE POINT AS WELL IS THAT IT CAN HAUL THOUGH THE DISEASE CAN'T BE CURED OR ITSELF TREATED THE TREATMENT OF THE SYMPTOMS CAN HAVE A REAL ALL IN
THAT'S RIGHT THIS IS THIS IS A PROGRESSIVE AND INCURABLE CONDITION CAUSES DAMAGE TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE DIE WITHIN TWO YEARS OF A DIAGNOSIS IT'S IMPORTANT THERE ARE NO DELAYS SO SUIT
TREATMENT CAN BE GIVEN TO EASE THE SYMPTOMS AND DELAY THE PROGRESSION BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE EARLY AND GETTING THEM ONTO CLINICAL TRIALS BECAUSE I WAS THE GREAT HOPE HERE IS ON ONE HAND TO DEVELOP A DEFINITIVE TEST WHICH WE DON'T HAVE AT THE MOMENT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE DIAGNOSED QUICKER WITH CERTAINTY AND THEN OF COURSE IN THE FUTURE HOPEFULLY TO DEVELOP A TREATMENT AS WELL
THANKS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE WORLD'S LONGEST AND DEEPEST RAIL TUNNEL WILL BE OFFICIALLY OPEN TODAY IT IN SWITZERLAND AND SO WAS IMOGEN FOLKS GOOD MORNING TO YOU IMOGEN
KIDS MORNING NOW THIS IS THE GOT HARD TO BASE A TUNNEL AND IT'S CONNECTING ROTTERDAM IN THERE LIKE THAT ALL THE WAY TO GENOA IN ITALY IS THAT IT FIFTY SEVEN MILES OF IT
FIFTY FIVE WELL THIRD THAT'S RIGHT FIFTY SEVEN KILOMETRE RIGHT THIRTY FIVE MILES AND IT'S THE KEY LINCHPIN BEAT ON THAT
EURGH THAT CRUCIAL EUROPE TRADE ROUTE FROM THE PAW OF THE LAW WORSE DOWN TO ITALY IN THE PORTS IN THE SOUTH AND IF YOU WERE A GOOD SEE WHAT I COULD SEE NOW JOHN WITH THESE GREAT LOOMING WALLS OF ROCK THE ALPS
JUST WAKING UP IN THE MORNING GREY MIST SWIRLING AROUND THEM DO YOU GET A REALLY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT ENGINEERING CHALLENGE IT'S MEAN EVEN IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TO BORE THROUGH FIFTY SEVEN KILOMETRES THE WORLD'S LONGEST AND TUNA HAVE CLEMATIS DOWN THE DEEPEST RAIL TUNNEL MASSIVE JOB ISN'T IT I WAS READING THAT IN THE NOTE THAT THEY CAN'T THERE'S ENOUGH ROCK EXCAVATED TO BUILD SIX EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS
THAT'S RIGHT THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF MASSIVE STATISTICS THAT GO WITH THIS TUNNEL I WENT DOWN THERE ACTUALLY AND THE PROUD POSSESSOR OF A LITTLE PIECE OF THAT ROCK IN THE FAT BECAUSE WHEN THEY WERE BUILDING IT I WENT DOWN THE TWO AND A HALF KILOMETRES AT INCREDIBLE SCENE OF PEOPLE WORKING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR
IT CONSTANCE MUCH AS IT COST FOR EXAMPLE TO STAGE THE LONDON OLYMPICS ANOTHER INTERESTING THING YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE BRITISH VOTERS MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN IS THAT WE HAVE SO MANY REFERENDA HERE IN SWITZERLAND PAYING FOR IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE SWISS AND THEY VOTED IN FAVOUR SO THEIR TAXES HAVE COME UP WITH THE PRICE THE REASON BEING THEY'RE ALPINE VALLEYS ARE SO CLOGGED WITH ROAD TRAFFIC BIG FORTY TON LORRIES ABSOLUTE I WAS NOT SO CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO THE ALPS ISN'T IT
THAT'S WHAT THE SWISS HOPE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE HAULAGE FIRMS WILL HAVE TO BE PERSUADED BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PERSUADED FINANCIALLY BY PRETTY HEAVY DUTY ROAD TAXES AND THE FACT THAT THIS TUNNEL WE'LL GO WHERE TO INCREDIBLE SPEEDS IT WILL GO AT UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES AN HOUR SO THEY WILL GET WEIRDER THEY WANT TO BE AND THEIR FREIGHT WILL GET WITH THEIR COMPANIES WANTED TO BE MORE QUICKLY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT BREAK FROM THE ROOT SIT IN THE TUNNEL
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME THANKS VERY MUCH SIXTY MINUTES PAST SIX NEWS BRAZIL ON BRAKES IT ON BEER MATS HIS ROCK YES GOOD MORNING THERE ARE TWENTY TWO DAYS TO GO UNTIL THE REFERENDUM ON THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IT SEEMS YOU CANNOT ESCAPE THE CAMPAIGN NOT EVEN IN THE PUB ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST PUB CHAINED WETHERSPOON'S HAS PRINTED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BEER MATS BURYING A HARD HITTING MESSAGE ARGUING FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
YESTERDAY MORNING WE HEARD FROM A DECO THE BIG RECRUITMENT FIRM THAT WANTS THE U.K. TO REMAIN THIS MORNING WE HAVE THE MAN WHO ASSIGNED THOSE BRICKS IT BEER MATS THE WETHERSPOON'S FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN TIM MARTIN MORNING TIM MORNING ROB ARE YOU CONCERNED YOU'LL BE THAT'S MAY WELL ANTAGONISE DRINKERS WHO WANT BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
WELL THEY MIGHT DO I SUPPOSE ERM I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID THEY WANT IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS FACTS AND THE FACT IS THAT CHRISTINE LA GARDE HEAD OF THE I.M.F. WAS PARADED BY THE CHANCELLOR IN FRONT OF THE MEDIA BECAUSE SHE SAID IT WOULD BE BAD TO VERY VERY BAD IF BREAKS IT OCCURRED
AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT SHE'S ABOUT TO STAND TRIAL IN RESPECT OF A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION EURO PAYMENTS OF BERNARD TAPIE A GUY IN FRANCE WHO HAS BEEN IN JAIL SO THE PUBLIC CAN MAKE UP ITS OWN MIND ON WAS FLOGGING YOU A PENSION AND THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU THEY'RE ABOUT TO STAND TRIAL IN RESPECT TO A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION
SITUATION LIKE THAT YOU MIGHT BE QUITE A LONG TIME O.K. OF COURSE CHRISTINE THE GUARD DENIES ANY WRONGDOING BUT IF WE IF WE LOOK AT YOUR BUSINESS WHERE THE SPOONS WHICH RULES FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE HOLDING YOU BACK
WELL I THINK THAT ALL THE RULES THERE ARE HIGH LEVELS OF TAX AND THE FACT THAT THE LAWS ARE UNPREDICTABLE BECAUSE IT'S NOT DEMOCRATIC LAWS AREN'T MADE BY ANYONE YOU CAN TO DE SELECT THEY'RE MADE BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION IS FANTASTICALLY DIFFICULT TO WORK OUT
WHERE BRITISH LAW ENDS IN E.U. LAW HER BEGINS BUN LOOK AT GREECE LOOK AT PORTUGAL LOOK AT SPAIN IT'S A TRAGIC IT'S A TRAGEDY THE WAY IT'S GOING AND WHEN YOU START TO LOSE DEMOCRACY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WE ARE NOT IN THE EURO AREA TAX ARE SET BY THE U.K. GOVERNMENT LAWS ARE DECIDED PARTLY BY BRITISH M.E.P.S ELECTED BY BRITISH VOTERS BY THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL WHICH INCLUDES THE PRIME MINISTER WELL THEY'RE OVER ANY PEAS OR VERY LITTLE INFLUENCE HALF OUR LAWS AROUND HALF OUR LAWS COME FROM THE NEW AND THEY'RE INITIATED BY PEOPLE WE DON'T ELECT
AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE ENEMY PLEASE FIFTY THREE ABOUT OUT OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO HAVE MUCH INFLUENCE EVEN THEY SAY THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN OF HER KEYS BRECHT'S TO TEARS LIKE YOU WERE OF WHAT THEY'RE CALLING FANTASY ECONOMICS THEY SAY THAT IF WE LEAVE WE COULD SLIDE INTO RECESSION THOUSANDS OF JOBS COULD BE LOST AND WE'D BE PERMANENTLY POORER THAN WE OTHERWISE WOULD BE YOU MAY ALL THINK THOSE PREDICTIONS ARE RUBBISH BUT DO YOU ACCEPT THAT AND E. YOU EXIT FOR THE U.K. IS A RISK NO
DEMOCRACY EQUALS PROSPERITY AND FREEDOM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WEST GERMANY VERSUS EAST GERMANY NORTH AMERICA AND SHRINES OF DEMOCRACY VERSUS THE SOUTH WHICH DIDN'T HAVE IT DEMOCRACY ALWAYS WINS IN THIRTY YEARS JAPAN ROSE FROM THE ASHES TO BE THE SECOND BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IT UNLEASHES POWERFUL FORCES
WHEN YOU TAKE IT AWAY YOU GET GREASE AND YOU GET PORTUGAL AND YOU GET CHAOS YOU CAN'T HAVE UNELECTED PEOPLE MAKING THESE DECISIONS OH KAY THANK YOU TIM TIM AFTER ANOTHER CHAIRMAN OF WETHERSPOON'S NOW A FEW YEARS AGO BRAZIL WAS HAILED AS PART OF THE SO CALLED BRICK NATIONS COUNTRIES FORECAST TO RESHAPE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BUT THE LATEST HEALTH CHECK ON BRAZIL'S ECONOMY IS EXPECTED TO SHOW IT REMAINS IN A TAILSPIN IT'S RECESSION IS ALREADY IT'S WORST SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND DATA UP LATER TODAY
IS EXPECTED TO SHOW THE ECONOMY CONTRACTED BY SIX PERCENT IN THE YEAR TO THE END OF MARCH THIS IS ALL SET AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF A PRESIDENT FACING AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL THE SPREAD OF THE ZICA VIRUS AND THE FORTHCOMING OLYMPICS WITH US IS BENNY BILBAO SENIOR LATIN AMERICA ANALYST AT THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW MUCH THEN IS THE BAD POLITICS TO BLAME FOR BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC POSITION
WELL I THINK THAT FOR A SEAL WOULD WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THERE IS TO SETS OF FACTORS THAT ARE AFFECTING ECONOMIC SITUATION AT THE MOMENT SO SUMMER EXTERNAL SO
END OF THE COMEDY TO SUPER CYCLE AND THIS IS AFFECTING LOT PRISSY ELSE ECONOMY BUT ALSO THE INTERNAL FACTORS DUE TO BAD POLITICS AND POOR A CROC AND I'M A POLITICS AND THE PASSES AFFECTING THE STREETS AN IMBECILE THE INABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT THE MESSAGE THAT I'VE MADE IT TO ACTUALLY CONFRONT THE CURRENT SITUATION THE CORRUPTION SCANDAL EFFECT IN THE POLITICAL
AND ALSO THE BUSINESS IN THE COUNTRY THIS THIS ALL AFFECTING BECAUSE I'M SECLUSION POLICEMAN THE CONFIDENCE IN THE QUANTUM IMBECILE SO A RECESSION WHICH WAS TRIGGERED BY THE SLUMP IN COMMODITY PRICES IS NOW BEING MADE MUCH WORSE BY
POLITICAL CRISES AND SO CAN THE ECONOMY RECOVER BEFORE THE POLITICS ARE FIXED WELL I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE TO POLITICS IN PLACE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ADOPT THE POLICIES THAT WILL ACTUALLY HAVE RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND THEN THE ECONOMY WILL BE IN A STRONGER FOOTING
OBVIOUSLY THAT CAN BE AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONDITION IN DICK'S ECONOMIC CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF THE RECOVERY OF THE COMMODITIES
BUT THAT WILL ONLY BE ONE OF THE LEVERS FOR PRESS SO TO BE ABLE TO COME OUT FROM THE RECESSION WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THE OLYMPICS IN RIO WILL PROVIDE A BIT OF AN ECONOMIC JOLT OUT OF RECESSION WELL DO YOU KNOW THE OLYMPICS OUR VERY PUNCTUAL ELEMENT AND YOU KNOW IT SLIGHTLY THAT'S IT WILL ATTRACT SOME TRACTION DURING WEEKS THAT OLYMPICS WITH TAKE PLACE BECAUSE OF THE VISITORS
THAT IF WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BUT TO SEEK A VIRUS MAY ACTUALLY AFFECT THE NUMBER OF THIS IT MAY ALSO UNDERPIN A LITTLE BITS TO POTENTIAL LOFTY OLYMPICS TO ACTUALLY TRIGGER AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY BUT IF THAT HAPPENS IT WILL BE VERY PUNCTUAL IN ANY CASE AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THIS THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ECONOMY AND THE POLITICS ARE PUT IN PLACE HERE ABOUT VIRUSES HARMING THE ECONOMY
WELL AT THE MOMENT IT IS IT IS NOT CLEAR WHICH IS THE TOTAL EFFECT OF THE SICK UP I RESPECT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW GIVEN THE LATEST NEW STUCK ME HALF AND THE RISKS ARE DISSED ME AFFECT THE NUMBER OF VISITORS IN FRONT OLYMPICS IMBECILE IN A YEAR WHERE
THE RESPECT FOR NUMBERS OF THIS JUST ME ACTUALLY AFFECT ECONOMY OH YOU BRING UP BILBAO SORRY FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT ARE MARKETS GUESS THIS MORNING AS JANE SAID NUMB INVESTMENT DIRECT AT RATHBONE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT MORNING JANE GOOD MORNING LATER ON WE'RE GOING TO LEARN WHICH OF THE U.K.'S LISTED COMPANIES WILL EITHER BE PROMOTED TO AUTOMATED FROM THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED SO WHO'S HOT AND WHO'S NOT
WELL PET POSSIBLY MORRISON'S MAY COME BACK IN AGAIN AFTER HAVING HAVING SORT OF FALLEN OUT OVER EVER PRETTY DIFFICULT SALES PERIOD THE DEAL THAT THEY'VE DONE IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE HELPING THEIR SHARE PRICE RIGHT MOVE MAY MAY BE WELL BE PROMOTED BUT MERLIN ENTERTAINMENTS MAY WELL LEAVE AFTER OBVIOUSLY THAT TERRIBLE ACCIDENT
ALTON TOWERS YOURS OH GO AND AND WHY DOES THIS MATTER FOR A COMPANY THAT DOES IT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON HAVE YOUR SHARE PRICE GOES UP OR DOWN IT DOES MAKE AN IMPACT NOT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE INDEX FUNDS SO FUNDS HAD REALLY TRYING TO FOLLOW THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED INDEX WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES IN THOSE COMPANIES THAT ARE GOING INTO THE INDEX AND SELL THOSE THAT ARE COMING OUT SO IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO TO FLOWS OF MONEY
THE HIGH STREET CHAIN AUSTIN REED WE HEARD LATE YESTERDAY'S TO CLOSE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY STORES WITH THE LOSS OF A THOUSAND JOBS THERE IS YET NO SALE OF B.H.S. IT'S REALLY TOUGH ON THE HIGH STREET IT CERTAINLY IS AND ESPECIALLY IN THAT WHAT'S WHAT'S HAVE DEEMED TO BE THE MIDDLE GROUND AND WHAT'S INTERESTING I THINK WITH AUSTIN REED IS THAT THE BRAND
HAS BEEN SOLD TO EDINBURGH WOOLLEN MILLS ALONG WITH FIVE CONCESSIONS AND THE FEELING IS THAT YOU NO IT'S A BRAND THAT COULD BE REVIVED AT AUSTIN REED DRESSED THE BEATLES AND ELIZABETH TAYLOR SO THEY'RE KIND OF THOSE ASSOCIATIONS COULD COULD BE USED AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE EASIER FOR AUSTIN REED BUT IT WILL BE FOR THE H. S. O. K. THANK YOU JANE CINEMA FROM RATHBONE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT MORE THAN POWER HOUSE PROJECT WHICH THIS MORNING
HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS DEVOLVING POWER FROM WOMEN TO MEN THAT'S AN ACCUSATION FROM THE FAWCETT SOCIETY WHICH SAYS THAT REGIONAL DEVOLUTION RISKS BECOMING A BOYS' CLUB WITH US IS THE FAWCETT SOCIETY IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAM SMOTHERS MORNING SAM YOU MORNING HOW IS POWER BEING DEVOLVED FROM WOMEN TO MEN WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS AN INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN NEW STRUCTURES AT LOCAL LEVEL AND PUBLISHED TO DENT HER ANALYSIS OF THE NORTHERN POWERHOUSE TODAY AND FOUND THAT ONE IN FIVE
COUNCIL LEADERS AND DIRECT ELECTED MAYORS ARE WOMEN AND JUST ONE OF THE SEVEN COMMAND AUTHORITY CHAIRS SO THEY'RE CREATING THIS NEW TIER OF GOVERNMENT BUT ACTUALLY WITH VERY LITTLE SCRUTINY OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND FEW WOMEN IN IT SO ALL THE STRUCTURES ANY LESS REPRESENTATIVE OF WOMEN BUT THEN OTHER POWER STRUCTURES IN THE COUNTRY WERE CERTAINLY IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THEIR JED THE BALANCE ON LOCAL COUNCILS FOR EXAMPLE FORTY PER CENT OF COUNCILLORS ACROSS THE NORTHERN POWERHOUSE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE WOMEN SO WE ARE SEEING
WOMEN AT THE TOP OF THOSE AT THOSE NEW STRUCTURES IN THAT IS A REAL CONCERN TO US AND CLEARLY WE DON'T REALLY KNOW YET WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEANING IN PRACTICE BUT THE INTENTION IS TO GIVE THESE BODIES CONSIDERABLE POWERS AND SPENDING POWER SO THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT THE NORTHERN IS ABOUT EMPOWERING LOCAL PEOPLE IF THEY CHOOSE MEN TO LEAD THEIR AUTHORITIES NOT UP TO THEM BUT ACTUALLY HE'S NOT LOCAL PEOPLE CHOOSING THE THESE REPRESENTATIVES ON THE WHOLE THESE DEALS HAVE BEEN DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITH THE TREASURY WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
THE DETAIL OF WHAT'S BEEN AGREED OR HOW IT'S BEEN NEGOTIATE BUT THEY ARE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE DOING THESE DEALS THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES HAZARD LATELY LOCAL COUNCIL LEADERS BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS ACTUALLY THE NEW BODIES BEING CREATED WHICH ARE NOT REALLY PUTTING WOMEN AND THOSE POSITIONS AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO LOOK AT THE PANTS LEADERSHIP IN THOSE AUTHORITIES YOU YOU COULD SEE THESE NEW COUNCIL IN THESE NEW REPRESENTED BODIES
FOR EXAMPLE A DOCTOR AND YOU DON'T HAVE CLOSE AND GENDER PAY CUT OR INVESTING OUR SOCIAL CARE AND CHILDCARE INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET MORE WOMEN
INTO THE INTO THE WORKPLACE BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WE DON'T HAVE AT THE MOMENT IS ROW TRANSPARENCY THE PROCESS THAT'S A CONCERN O.K. THANK YOU SAM SAM'S MOTHER'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE FAWCETT SOCIETY OR THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THE NORTHERN POWER HOUSE PROJECT WAS UP IS ABOUT EMPOWERING LOCAL PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE AREA'S BEST AND THEY SAY WHILE LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT IS A MATTER FOR INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITIES THE GOVERNMENT EXPECT SUCH DECISIONS TO BE TAKEN WITH REGARD TO GENDER EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY

TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IT'S FORTY YEARS SINCE TO BUBS EXCUSE ME SEEMS TO PUBS IN BIRMINGHAM WERE BOMBED AND TWENTY ONE PEOPLE KILLED IN A FEW HOURS WE'LL KNOW WHETHER THE INQUEST INTO THOSE DEATHS WILL BE REOPENED PAUL AND WHO LOST HIS FATHER STAN SAYS IT'S TIME THEY GOT THE ANSWERS THEY DESERVE
I REALLY DON'T MIND WHAT COMES OUT IN THE SENSE I JUST WANT THE TRUTH IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT SO PALATABLE THEN I THINK WE COULD LIVE WITH YOU WE HAVE TO FOR FORTY TWO YEARS AND WAS A RIFIC NOT YOU CAN'T GET IT WORSE THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ALREADY SO WE THINK IF IT COMES UP WE CAN LIVE WITH BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO PROVE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
AND I'M GOING ON THE LINE BY A CORRESPONDENT PHIL MACKIE PHIL WE DO KNOW WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE BOMBINGS BECAUSE THEIR NAMES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED HAVEN'T THEY
WHAT COULD WE LEARN FROM AN INQUEST THAT WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE NOT HAVING THE THE NORMAL PURPOSE OF AN INQUEST TO DETERMINE WHO HER WHO DIE HOW THEY DIED WHEN THEY DIED AND WHERE THEY DIED AND WE KNOW ALL OF THOSE THINGS ALREADY AND THIS WAS CERTAINLY THE ARGUMENT THAT WAS HEARD BY THE BIRMINGHAM CORONER LOUISE HUNT AGAINST REOPENING THE INQUEST BUT THEIR FAMILIES WERE REPRESENTED BY THEIR OWN LAWYERS AT THE SUBMISSIONS DURING THE HEARINGS THAT WE'VE HAD UP UNTIL TODAY AND THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE IS A LOT THAT ISN'T KNOWN AND OUR HILLSBOROUGH THE FAMILIES AND THE SURVIVORS
DESERVE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS THEY'VE BEEN ASKING FOR FOUR DECADES HOW MUCH DID THE AUTHORITIES KNOW FOR INSTANCE IN ADVANCE WERE WERE THEY AWARE THAT THERE WERE BOMBS ARE BACK TO BE PLANNED IN BIRMINGHAM AS WAS SUGGESTED AT THE FIRST OF THE HEARINGS BEFORE TODAY'S SAS SUGGESTION WHERE THEY PRETEND BUT I DID THEY EFFECTIVELY TRY TO PROTECT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A MOLE WITHIN THE I.R.A. AT THE TIME WERE THEIR MISTAKES MADE BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
AND THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ON THE NIGHT IN TERMS OF THE RESPONSE TO THE BOMBS ALL OF THOSE SINS THEY DESPERATELY WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWERS TO ULTIMATELY I THINK THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FOUGHT TO GET THIS INQUEST RYOKAN SIMPLY THINK THIS IS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY THEY MAY GET THEIR ORDER THEIR SIXTIES SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES NOW
FINALLY HEAR WHAT WHAT WENT ON THAT NIGHT IN DETAIL SOMETHING THEY'D NEVER HEARD THE TRUTH ABOUT BEFORE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY AS WE KNOW THE CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS OF THEIR SIX MEN THERE WERE SPOTS EVIDENCE IN THAT AND A LOT OF THE DETAILS DIDN'T COME OUT SO MANY PEOPLE WAITING AND HOPING AND I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE TWENTY TO THIRTY SURVIVORS AND RELATIVES OF VICTIMS THAT NIGHT TURNING UP IN SOLIHULL TODAY WHETHER IT WORKED THE DECISION WILL BE
SOMETIME AFTER TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING IN FACT THAT NUMBER IS GROWING WHEN I FIRST STARTED REPORTING ON THIS CAMPAIGN TO GET THE INQUEST REOPEN ABOUT A DECADE AGO IT WAS REALLY JUST TWO PEOPLE JULIAN AND BRIAN HAMBLETON WHOSE SISTER MAXINE WHO DIED WHO WERE LAUNCHING THE CAMPAIGN AND IF YOU SPOKE TO ANYBODY ELSE THEY WERE REALLY OF THE OPINION THAT THEY WOULD NEVER GET THE ANSWERS IT WAS PROBABLY TOO MUCH TROUBLE IT MIGHT EVEN RAKE UP BAD MEMORIES BUT I THINK AS THIS PROCESS HAS GONE ON MORE OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE COME TO SIDE WITH THE HAMILTONS
AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ANSWERS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT THERE IS INFORMATION THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR AND IN FACT TWO WEEKS AGO IN THE FINAL DAY OF SUBMISSIONS BEFORE TODAY'S DECISION LOUISE HUNT SAID THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED SOME SIGNIFICANT NEW EVIDENCE YOU WOULDN'T GO INTO IT SHE WOULDN'T SAY WHERE IT HAD COME FROM BUT SHE SAID IT HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD IN PUBLIC BEFORE NOR EVEN MENTIONED IN ANY OF THE BOOKS ABOUT THE BOMBING SO THEY'RE VERY DESPERATE TO HEAR THAT AND REALLY SAY THAT
SHE WERE TO RULE THAT THE INQUEST SHOULD RESUME AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS IT WOULD BE SEISMIC WELL WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM JULIE HAMBLETON LATER IN THE PROGRAMME AT TEN PAST EIGHT PHIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIME AT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS TO SEVEN ALL HELL HAS BROKEN LOOSE IN THE IRAQI CITY OF FALLUJAH THE CITY JUST THIRTY MILES OR SO FROM BAGHDAD A SCENE OF COURSE MORE THAN ITS SHARE OF HORROR IN TWO YEARS OF OCCUPATION BY
FORCES OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE NOW THE IRAQI ARMY'S TRYING TO RETAKE IT CERTAINLY NOT A SIMPLE OPERATION AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CIVILIANS TRAPPED THERE JIMMY OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT MONITORING WHAT'S GOING ON AND I MEAN REAL FEARS JIM FOR AS MANY AS FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET OUT
THAT'S RIGHT THERE ARE DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY ARE STILL TRAPPED THERE YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME WE WERE DOWN AT ONE OF THE REAR BASES OF THE IRAQI ARMED FORCES THEM TALKING TO THE COMMANDER OF THE ELITE UNITS WHICH ARE DOING NATURAL FRONT LINE COMBAT ROLE HIS ESTIMATE WAS BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY THOUSAND SO NOBODY REALLY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW MANY THE FACT IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN
FORCED TO MOVE INTO THE CITY CENTRE BY EYE YES THEY'RE REFUGEES DISPLACED PEOPLE WHO HAVE MANAGED TO COME OUT AND THAT'S ROUGHLY BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX HUNDRED FAMILIES BUT ABOUT ROUGHLY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT FROM THE CITY CENTRE THEY'RE ALL FROM OUTLYING AREAS AROUND THE PERIMETER OF ITSELF SO THERE IS GREAT CONCERN THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HERDED IN PER CENT
AND THE ACCUSATION WIDELY VOICED ABOUT THE U.N. AND OTHERS IS THAT THEY'RE SIMPLY BEING USED HUMAN SHIELDS AND IF THEY TRY TO ESCAPE THEY DO GET SHOT YEAH AND IN THAT CASE DO YOU THINK OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE AMERICANS ALL THOSE YEARS AGO IN THE BATTLE FOR FALLUJAH WERE THEY THEY SORT OF STOP THE NET ONE STAGE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T THEY COULDN'T GETTING WORRIED ABOUT CIVILIANS YOU WONDER WHETHER IN THIS CASE IF THERE ARE CIVILIANS AT RISK WHETHER THE IRAQIS IRAQI ARMY THERE ARE KEEN MILITIAS WOULD SHOW THE SAME DEGREE OF RESTRAINTS OR WHAT
WELL THEY SAY THEY WILL THE GENERAL WE TALKED TO SAID THAT ACTUALLY THE CIVILIANS WERE THEIR TOP PRIORITY THEIR OWN SAFETY THE SECOND PRIORITY ONLY THEN YOU KNOW MY REAL ESTATE AS IT WERE PROPERTY AND SO ON SO AND OF COURSE GETTING RID OF BUT THEY DO THEY SAID FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHEN THEY'RE PLANNING AN ATTACK THEY TAKE A CERTAIN ROUTE BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO AVOID CIVILIAN CONCENTRATIONS ON THEY SAY WE DO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WE'RE IN TOUCH WITH THEM SO AT LEAST ON PAPER
THAT IS THE CASE BUT IF THERE ARE GOING TO STORM THE CITY CENTRE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BOMBARD IT VERY HEAVILY WE KNOW THAT JUST SMALL NUMBERS OF FIGHTERS CAN HOLD OFF WHOLE ARMIES IF THEY'RE IN BUILT UP TERRAIN THEY KNOW THEMSELVES VERY WELL THE ATTACKING FORCES ARE AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGE SO THE THEORY IS THAT THERE WON'T BE MUCH LEFT OF FALLUJAH WHICH HAS ALREADY HAD A VERY HEAVY POUNDING SINCE THE SIEGE WAS IMPOSED NINE MONTHS AGO THERE MAY NOT BE MUCH LEFT BY THE TIME IT'S ALL OVER AND OF COURSE HUGE FEAR FOR THOSE CIVILIANS TRAPPED THERE
THANKS TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE T.U.C. WILL CALL ON THE UNION MEMBERS TODAY TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR ARE ALL THE UNIONS OR PRETTY WELL ALL THE UNIONS IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN NORMAN NOT ALL BUT THE OVERWHELMING BODY OF THE UNION MOVEMENT YES HE'S IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN AND
THE ARGUMENT THE T.U.C. ARE MAKING TODAY IS THAT IF WE LEFT THEM THEY CLAIM WAGES WOULD BE HAD BY AROUND THIRTY EIGHT POUNDS A WEEK THAT BETTER PAID JOBS IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR WOULD BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE BECAUSE THE HIT ON EXPORTS AND THAT VARIOUS EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS BE AT PROTECTING PART TIMERS MATERNITY PAY EQUAL PAY ALL THAT SORT OF THING WOULD BE AT RISK ANDRE BRECHT'S
ADMINISTRATION BUT WHAT IS STRIKING IS THIS COMES AMID MOUNTING ANXIETY REALLY AMOUNTS TO REMAIN CAMPAIGN ABOUT WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING TO THE TRADITIONAL LABOUR VOTE AMID SIGNS THAT IT IS CONFUSED I'M ENTHUSED ABOUT THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND TENSIONS WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY OVER ITS APPROACH TO THIS REFERENDUM WITH JOHN MACDONALD ATTACKING SIDDIQUE KHAN FOR SHARING A PLATFORM WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ACCUSING HIM OF
DE MOTIVATING LABOUR SUPPORTERS CONTINUING GRUMBLINGS ABOUT THE LACK OF OOMPH FROM JEREMY CORBIN WHO'S ON HOLIDAY THIS WEEK AND FEARS THAT SOME IN MISTER CORBIN'S OFFICER QUITE RELAXED TO STAND BACK FROM THIS REFERENDUM AND LET IT CONTINUE AS A BLUE ON BLUE BLOOD BATH WELL I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT MISTER CORBIN IF HE IS NOTIONALLY IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN BUT HE HASN'T BEEN VERY VOCAL AS
BUT THERE REMAINS A STRONG SUSPICION AMONGST MANY LABOUR M.P.S THAT BLUNTLY HIS HEART IS NOT IN IT AND THAT WITHIN
HIS OFFICE THERE IS A VIEW THAT ACTUALLY THEY DON'T NEED TO DO THAT MUCH AND THEY CAN LET THIS UNFOLD AS AN INTERNAL TORIES CIVIL WAR AND THAT THEY ARE EVEN RELATIVELY RELAXED AS TO WHETHER THIS WOULD LEAD TO A GENERAL ELECTION SO THERE IS NO SORT OF REAL DRIVE IT SEEMS AT THE MOMENT FROM THE CORBIN CAMP TO TRY AND IMMOBILISE THE LABOUR SUPPORT BUT AT A TIME
WHEN WE KNOW THE BRICKS AT CAMP I'M DELIBERATELY REFRAMING THEIR ARGUMENT TO APPEAL TO TRADITIONAL BLUE COLLAR WORKING CLASS VOTERS BY FOCUSING ON THOSE ISSUES OF IMMIGRATION JOBS AND PAY I DO IMMIGRATION IS THE ONE THAT CITY WAS REALLY TO HAVE TAKEN OFF
AND TODAY WE GET FROM MISSUS JOHNSON AND GO OVER THE BLUEPRINT FOR REFORM OF IMMIGRATION AND THEY SUGGEST WE MOVE TO AUSTRALIA AND POINT START SYSTEM WHERE E.U. MIGRANTS WOULD ONLY BE ADMITTED ON THE BASES ONE THEY'VE GOT A JOB TO DO THEY BRING SKILLS AND CREDENTIALS THAT THEY WORK WITH WE WANT THREE THEY SPEAK DECENT ENGLISH AND FOR THEY ARE IN GOOD HEALTH
THE WRINKLE IN THEIR ARGUMENT IS WHETHER ACTUALLY YOU WOULD MAKE MUCH SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MEETING THIS TARGET OF GETTING NET MIGRATION DOWN TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT NON E.U. MIGRATION WHICH IS ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN YOU MIGRATION THAT'S ALREADY DOUBLE THE TARGET AND THAT WOULDN'T BE AFFECTED AT ALL BY THESE CHANGES BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY A POINTS SYSTEM SO EVEN IF YOU STOPPED EVERY SINGLE Y. U. MIGRANT COMING INTO BRITAIN YOU'D STILL BE MILES ADRIFT SECONDLY IT CONFIRMS
THEY'RE THE BRICKS AT CAMP ARE NOT INTERESTED IN BEING PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET BECAUSE IF YOU'RE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET YOU HAVE TO BE PART OF THE COMMON LABOUR MARKET ALLOWING PEOPLE TO MOVE AROUND TO LOOK FOR WORK BUT PERHAPS THE MOST STRIKING THING JOHN IS THE WAY THE ARGUMENT IS FRAMED THEY PRESENT THESE PROPOSALS ALMOST AS AN ALTERNATIVE A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA THEY SAY THEY WOULD AMEND THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY'S ACT GET OUT OF THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS SCRAP
FREE MOVEMENT INTRODUCED AN AUSTRALIAN STYLE POINTS SYSTEM THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES ALMOST AS A PUTATIVE ALTERNATIVE BRECHT SAID GOVERNMENT OR WHAT THEY EXPECT MISTER CAMERON TO DO IF HE SURVIVES AFTER BRECHT'S HAD VOTE NO THANK YOU
THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS THE SUM OF THE TELEGRAPH HIGHLIGHT WHAT THEY CALL THE SIX MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO SAVE THE LIFE OF TWO YEAR OLD LIAM FAE HIS MOTHER ON HER CIVIL PARTNER WERE FOUND GUILTY YESTERDAY OF HIS MURDER
AND HAVE A CATALOGUE OF ABUSE AGAINST TWO OTHER CHILDREN CONCERNS WERE RAISED SIX TIMES THE PAPERS SAY BY NEIGHBOURS AND CARERS AS WELL IN THE YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH IN THE ONE YEAR AND FAT BEFORE HIS DEATH THE DAILY MIRROR WHICH CALLS THE KILLER'S SHAMELESS FOR TRYING TO BLAME ANOTHER CHILD FOR LIAM'S DEATH HAS POLICE AND SOCIAL SERVICES MUST ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THEY MESSED CLOSE THE TIME SAID THE INVESTIGATION WILL ADD LYNN FEES NAME TO THOSE OF PETER CONNOLLY DANIEL POKER ON THE HEARTBREAKING ROLE CALL OF APPARENT FAILURE I THINK
THE QUESTIONS ABOUT BRITAIN'S BORDER SECURITY ARE STILL PARAMOUNT FOR THE EXPRESS IT SAYS ILLEGAL MIGRANTS ARE PAYING TO HAVE ONE HUNDRED POUNDS EACH TO CROSS THE CHANNEL IN SMALL BOATS OR CRITICISES THE POOR STATE OF SECURITY ON THE COAST AS ALARMING THE SUN SAYS IT'S FOUND THAT CRIMINAL GANGS ARE CHARGING ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND BOAT OF THAT HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN SNEAKED IN TO THIS COUNTRY
AN INVESTIGATION HEADLINED THE CHANNEL'S SPRUNG A LEAK IT SAYS GANGS ARE USING SMALL VESSELS LAWN FROM A QUIET SPOT ON THE KENT COAST AND THAT'S EASY KEEP PICTURES SHOW REPEATED ACTIVITY THERE OVER SEVERAL DAYS THIS MONTH ITS FINDINGS SHOCKING CALLED BORDER SECURITY A JOKE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SAYS THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY SCRAPPED AND AERIAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMME OF THE COAST IN JANUARY DESPITE WARNINGS THAT DOING SO COULD WE CAN SECURITY A SPECIALIST FIRM AS PROVIDING ROUND THE CLOCK SURVEILLANCE
PAPER SAYS DAME PAULINE NEVILLE JONES A FORMER SECURITY MINISTER WROTE TO MISSUS MEHTA ADVISE AGAINST ENDING THE ARRANGEMENT IT SAYS SHE WAS TOLD THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO CONSIDER VALUE FOR MONEY THAT SCRAPPING THE SCHEME SAY FOUR MILLION POUNDS THE TELEGRAPH CON COGHLAN ARGUES THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO WAKE UP TO THE THREAT OF PRINT TO BRITAIN'S SHORES AND QUICKLY PROVIDE THE PATROL BOATS WHICH I NEED NEEDED MARKS AND SPENCER IS PRAISED BY THE MAIL FOR SAYING IT WILL STOP USING PIPED MUSIC ANY SHOPS PEACE AT LAST SIZE THE PAPER
I'VE CALLED IT THE DAY THE MUSAK AT DIED RETAIL ANALYSTS SAY THE MUSIC WHICH WAS INTRODUCED BY A NURSE TEN YEARS AGO CAN ENCOURAGED PURCHASES BUT IT SAYS THE SHOP'S AGING CUSTOMER BASE MIGHT PREFER A CALMER ENVIRONMENT THREE CHEERS FOR THE INITIATIVES AS THE TELEGRAPH
BUT PLEASE CHEER QUIETLY
THE TIME IS QUARTERS A SEVEN AT THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT'S HIGH PROFILE CAMPAIGN TO PROVIDE EVERY HOUSEHOLD FOR THE LOO BY TWENTY NINETEEN HAS HIT A HURDLE PEOPLE ARE REFUSING TO USE THEM NEARLY SIXTY PER CENT OF THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION PEOPLE DEFECATE IN THE OPEN ACROSS THE WORLD LIVE IN INDIA OR TOILET HABITS ARE HARD TO SHAKE WOMEN OFTEN LEFT OUT OF A CONVERSATION THE B.B.C.'S DIVYA ARIA
TRAVELLED TO A VILLAGE IN THE NORTH INDIAN STATE HAVE GOT A PROTEST TO SEE A BOLD NEW APPROACH IN ACTION
IT'S THE CRACK OF DAWN IN THE AIR IN THE FIELDS JASON TO THE VILLAGE AND SOMETHING REALLY BIZARRE IS PLAYING OUT IN FRONT OF ME THERE ARE THESE FIVE VOLUNTEERS THEY HAVE BRIGHT ORANGE JACKETS AND THEY'RE FLASHING TORCHES WHENEVER THEY SEE SOMEONE COME NEAR THE FIELDS
AND HAVE JUST STOPPED THIS OLD MAN WITH IT ONLY HAS A TOILET MOVED INSIDE HIS HOUSE WITH THE HELP OF THE GOVERNMENT
BUT HE STILL COMES TO THE FIELD EVERY DAY MY DAD THOUGHT THEY'VE COME OUT OF THERE
COUNTRY PEOPLE AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE US TIME TO GET USED TO IT OIL IT I'LL SURVIVE

NOW BEFORE ANY TOILETS ARE BUILT VOLUNTEERS IN THE VILLAGE RECEIVE TRAINING IT'S MORE A BUT OF THEM IN AT THE OTHER END OF LANCING IS THEIR LEADER
AND HE TELLS ME PRESERVING HONOUR AND SAFETY OF THE MEN IS THE GEAR ARGUMENT I WAS IT UP THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT BY ALEC IT WE DID THE VILLAGERS THAT THEN YOUR GODDESS TEN VIVES GORDO THE FEEDS AND BEARD DAD PART OF THE BODY OF IT SHOULD ONLY BE SEEN BY THE HUSBAND WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY HONOUR
THE BODY WAS ABOUT WHAT HE WOULD BE UP ON THE SET I'M NOT REALLY O.K. WELL I MEAN MOST OF THE WOMEN DON'T EVEN NEED TO BE CONVINCED THEY WANT A TOILET IT'S THE MEN HOLDING THEM BACK I'VE COME TO A NEARBY VILLAGE AND IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE FIRST ONE WITH SMALL BRICK HOUSE
US LOTS ABOUT WHAT
LYING AROUND AND THERE'S A VERY DISTINCT SMELL OF
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR OF COURSE IS THE TOILETS A LOT OF THEM BUILT OUTSIDE HOUSES AND THEY'RE THE SIZE OF A FOND
IT IS NOT IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN CONVERTED TO A STOREROOM WHICH HAS HUNDREDS OF COWDUNG
GIVE ME AN IMAGE AS THE EVEN BOREDOM GOT MARIE'S FAMILY DOYLE IT IS ALSO BEING USED AS A STOREROOM FOR CLAY POTS AND PLAUDITS OUR KID ME GOING HERE THEY HAVE NOT HAPPENED SO YOU NEED A MUG OF WATER FOR THE FIELDS
BUT A BUCKET OF WATER FOR THE TOILET WE CAN'T AFFORD DEBT WE GO TO THE FIELDS WITH A MODEL BEFORE DON AS MEN DROVE AROUND WHEN IT'S GREAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME HORRIFIC CASES OF WOMEN BEING RAPED AND MURDERED ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR FEET

WHAT EVERYONE THEN PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO TINGLE WHAT IT SIT BACK AND UNDERSTAND WHY DOESN'T HE DID AND THEN DEFINITELY CHANGE
I WAS REPORTING FROM UTTAR PRADESH THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW WHAT DOES THE E.U. REFERENDUM IN FOR BRITONS LIVING IN THE REST OF EUROPE THESE ARE UNCERTAIN TIMES WORRYING TIMES FOR SOME OF THEM THEY THINK THEIR LIVES MIGHT GET TRICKIER IF WE WERE TO LEAVE ZOE CONWAY IS IN MY BEER THIS MORNING ON THE SPANISH COSTA DEL SOL MORNINGS
GOOD MORNING JUSTIN I AM LOOKING AT A GREAT BIG SLAB OF SILVERY BLUE A SILVERY BLUE MEDITERRANEAN A BEAUTIFUL SILVERY BLUE SKY I CAN JUST ABOUT SEE THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS IN MOROCCO THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR AND WE'RE STANDING AT THE BLUE PALM CAFE THIS IS A CAFE OWNED BY A BRITISH COUPLE
HERE IN MY BAY AND I'M JOINED BY DOCTOR VINCENZI GROWN ADULTS HIS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR AT MALAGA UNIVERSITY HE'S SOMETHING OF A EUROPHILE COS HE'S ALSO WORKED IN BRITAIN CAN I JUST ASK YOU DOT
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HOW BRITAIN'S WHO WORK AND LIVE HERE ARE VIEWED BY THE SPANISH THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WORKING HERE BUT ALSO MANY OF OUR PENSIONERS ARE THEY LAUGHTER
WHEN MINING FESTIVAL ARE WELL QUITE PLEASED SAID INFUSED WITH THESE PEOPLE HE HAD TO BE HERE FOR A LONG TIME I HAVE ANY ABLE TRAINS HERE AND US WE'RE SEEN AS SOMETHING OF AN ASSET
ALAS IT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE SIDE LES VARIETY IN THE WAY SO THIS PLACE WE THOROUGHLY AND THERE IT WOULD BE VERY READY BORING SO WE'RE NOT SEEN AS SORT OF BURDEN ON SPAIN
BECAUSE THEY PICKED AXIS IT COULD REALLY BEAR THEY DID THIS PAN'S PEOPLE THEM BAKED AXIS BAD IT SEEMS TO ME THEY STAY HERE THEY HAVE IN THEIR BUSINESS OUR ENJOY THEIR PATIENTS WHEN THEY CAME TO RETIRE BECAUSE EVERYWHERE THERE AND BECAUSE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
BECAUSE WHAT STRUCK ME OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS TALKING TO BRITISH EXPATS HERE MANY OF THEM RETIRED IS THAT THEY'RE VERY CONFIDENT
THAT IF BRITAIN WAS TO LEAVE THE E.U. STATUS HERE REALLY WOULDN'T CHANGE THAT THINGS WOULD STAY PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN BRITISH POLITICIANS WHO'VE BEEN WARNING THAT THEIR RIGHT TO RESIDENCY HERE COULD BE AFFECTED
THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BUT IT IS A AT ALL THAT IS VERY NICE
SERVICING A SPIN BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT THESE THEY CASEY BUT IT THEN BECAME I'D FILLING TO DIFFER ON THE COLLAPSE OF THE CATS OF EUROPEAN UNION THERE ARE RELATED WE AGREE THERE

O.K. DOCTOR THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US WE HAVE WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK LATER ON WE'LL BE TALKING TO THE BRITISH OWNER OF THIS CAFE REACHED STEVENSON ABOUT HER LIFE HERE
THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS BUILDING A CAR PARK ACTUALLY A LORRY PARK NEAR THE CHANNEL TUNNEL M.P.S ARE NOT IMPRESSED LOUISE ALLMAN IS THE M.P. WHO CHAIRS THE TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE WHY NOT WAS ON THERE CERTAINLY A MASSIVE PROBLEM LAST YEAR THEY ALMOST COMPLETE BLOCKING OF SECTIONS OF THE M. TWENTY MEANT THERE WAS NATIONAL
PROBLEM BECAUSE EIGHTY PERCENT OF FREIGHT GOING TO THE CONTINENT USES THIS ROUTE AND THERE WAS MASSIVE LOCAL DISRUPTION TO SUDDENLY SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE DONE BUT IS IT RIGHT THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS IS SPENT ON BUILDING A GIANT LORRY PARK IT WOULD BE THE SECOND LARGEST LORRY PARK IN THE WHOLE OF THE WORLD AND THE SIZE OF DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA PERHAPS A BIT BIGGER THAN THAT WITHOUT REALLY EVALUATING THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND WHAT ARE THEY THEN WELL IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A SERIES OF SMALL THE LORRY PARKS COULD BE BUILT
THAT COULD BE COMBINED WITH EXPANDING THE ROAD NETWORK HAVING MORE FREIGHTS GOING ON RAILS RATHER THAN ROAD IMPROVING OTHER ACCESS ROADS THROUGH THE CHANNEL TUNNEL ON TO THE PORT AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE POSSIBLE BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN A FULL EVALUATION OF THEM LIKE IN MIGHT BE THAT THE GIANT LORRY PARK IT'S A RIGHT ANSWER BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAVEN'T REALLY MADE THE CASE OUT FOR THAT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO WORK AND IT'S GOING TO BE AFFECTED SO DOES IF YOU THINK THEY PANICKED A BIT
I THINK THERE WASN'T PANIC AND CERTAINLY THERE WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM LAST YEAR THERE'S BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM AND LAST YEAR THE ROUTE ON THE MOTORWAY WAS CLOSE FOR OVER THIRTY DAYS THERE'S A LOT OF TIME IT CAUSE MASSIVE CHAOS AND IT'S A LONGTERM PROBLEMS OR CERTAINLY SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENT THOUGHT HELP THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WHAT CAN WE DO LET'S BUILD A MASSIVE LORRY PARK
AND THEN CONSULT ON THE DETAIL BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WILL WORK WE DON'T KNOW WHAT REAL IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE ON THE LOCAL AREA NEAR AN AREA OF OUTSTANDING NATIONAL BEAUTY WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE LORRY POT WOULD HAVE TO BE MANAGED AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE WHOLE PROBLEM OR FLY PARKING WHICH AFFECTS THE WHOLE OF THE AREA WAY BEYOND WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO WORK
WOULD SAY FLY PARKING BEFORE MORISOT OR PARKING IN LOCAL ROADS WITH SWERVE DRIVING SO I SEE YES THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S CAUSING LOCAL PROBLEMS AND DISTRESS OFTEN TO LOCAL RESIDENTS THAT'S A BIGGER PROBLEM IS THAT GOING TO BE ADDRESSED AT THE SAME TIME AS LOOKING AT HOW TO STOP THIS CONGESTION ON THE MOST I SUPPOSE THE TROUBLE IS AND YOU CAN APPLY THIS TO SO MANY HUGE GOVERNMENT PROJECTS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER COUNTRY
IF YOU ENTER INTO CONSULTATION HAS IT MIGHT BE TEN YEARS BEFORE WE START LAYING A BRICK AS IT WERE THAT'S THAT'S ALWAYS THE DIFFICULTY WITH THESE THINGS ISN'T IT WELL BALANCE BETWEEN DOING SOMETHING BECAUSE SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME I'LL CERTAINLY ACTION HAS TO BE TAKEN SOMETHING REALLY DOES HAS TO BE DONE BUT I THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE THE INFORMATION BUT THEY JUST HAVEN'T EVALUATED THE AT THE OTHER OPTIONS IT'S INEVITABLY GOING TO TAKE TIME FOR THIS PROBLEM TO BE RESOLVED
EVEN ON THE PROPOSAL TO BUILD THIS MASSIVE GIANT LORRY PARK ONLY SOME OF IT WOULD BE READY FOR NEXT YEAR ON THE DEPARTMENT'S PLANS SO TIME WILL BE TAKEN AND IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS TO BUILD THE LORRY PARK WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT WILL COST TO ACTUALLY RUN IT AND TO RUN IT AFFECTED ME SO IT'S A LOT OF MONEY HE'S ADDRESSING A VERY BIG PROBLEM AND YES TIME IS IMPORTANT BUT WE SHOULD BE GETTING THE RIGHT ANSWER AND UP TO NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAVEN'T REALLY MADE THE CASE OUT THEY MIGHT BE RIGHT BUT THIS
BUT THEY HAVEN'T MADE A FULL EVALUATION AND MADE OUT A PROPER CASE TROUBLE IS IF WE DO HAVE THE SAME NEXT TO IN THE YEAR AFTER AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT COSTS A FORTUNE AS WELL WELL IT DOES COST AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE WHEN THAT MOTORWAY IS BLOCKED UP AND IT MEANS THAT FREIGHT CAN'T GET TO THE CHANNEL PORTS AND IT'S ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OF ALL THE FREIGHT FROM GREAT BRITAIN
THAT GOES FOR THE CONSCIENCE ACTUALLY GOES THROUGH THIS ROUTE SO IT'S A MASSIVE NATIONAL PROBLEM AND LOCAL DISRUPTION TO BECAUSE LOCAL PEOPLE SIMPLY CAN'T GET ABOUT THE BUSINESS WHEN TRAFFIC'S DISPLACED LOUIS GERMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THAT I'M THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN JOHN AMITABH JUSTIN IS THE FIRST OF JUNE WHICH TECHNICALLY AS FAR AS OUR CLIMATE RECORDS ARE CONCERNED IS THE FIRST DAY OF SUMMER AND FOR SOMERSET CERTAINLY WILL FEEL LIKE IT FOR OTHERS

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE FIRST OF JUNE THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING A CORONER WILL REVEAL TODAY WHETHER INQUESTS FOR THE TWENTY ONE VICTIMS OF THE BIRMINGHAM PUB BOMBINGS WILL BE RE OPENED CAMPAIGNERS FOR A BRITISH EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE CALLING FOR ALL MIGRANTS COMING TO THIS COUNTRY TO BE SUBJECT TO A POINTS BASED SYSTEM REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS ARE WARNING THAT BRICKS IT WOULD CAUSE WAGES TO FALL AND NEW EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED OF LONG DELAYS IN PEOPLE WITH MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE BEING DIAGNOSED AND TREATED
THE NEWS IS READ BY THE SUITE A CORONER WILL ANNOUNCE THIS MORNING WHETHER SHE WILL RESUME INQUESTS INTO THE DEATHS OF TWENTY ONE PEOPLE IN THE BIRMINGHAM PUB BOMBINGS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WIDELY THOUGHT TO BE THE WORK OF THE I.R.A.
THE ORIGINAL INQUEST WAS ADJOURNED A YEAR LATER WHEN SIX MEN WERE CONVICTED THEY WERE ACQUITTED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WEST MIDLANDS POLICE HAS CONSIDERED THE EVIDENCE TWICE SINCE THEN AND THE CORONER WHO'S BEEN REVIEWING THE CASE TOLD HER HEARING LAST MONTH THAT SHE'D RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT NEW MATERIAL
FROM BIRMINGHAM A CORRESPONDENT FILM AQUI REPORTS THE BOMBS RIPPED THROUGH THE TWO BIRMINGHAM PUBS THE MULBERRY BUSH IN THE TAVERN IN THE TOWN ON A BUSY THURSDAY EVENING TWENTY ONE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE WERE INJURED
THE BOMBERS HAVEN'T BEEN BROUGHT TO JUSTICE SEVERAL OF THE MEN BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED ARE STILL ALIVE VICTIMS' FAMILIES AND SURVIVORS BELIEVE THE INQUEST IS THE LAST CHANCE THEY'LL GET IN THEIR LIFETIMES TO HEAR EVIDENCE FROM THE POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICES ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED THAT NIGHT
THE BIRMINGHAM CORONER LOUISE HUNT SAYS SOME SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL NEVER PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE HAS ALREADY BEEN SUBMITTED TO HER CAMPAIGNERS HAVE DESCRIBED THE POSSIBILITY OF THE INQUEST BEING RESUMED AFTER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS A SEISMIC
THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS SAY ALL THEY WANT IS THE TRUTH PAUL BOARDMAN HIS FATHER STAN DIED IN THE BOMBINGS SAYS HE DOESN'T MIND WHAT COMES OUT NOW
I JUST WANT THE TRUTH IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TOO PALATABLE THEN I THINK WE COULD LIVE WITH YOU WE HAVE TO FOR FORTY TWO YEARS AND IS A RIFIC NOT YOU CAN'T GET IT WORSE THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ALREADY SO WE THINK IF IT COMES UP WE CAN LIVE WITH BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO PROVE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED COS WE DON'T KNOW FORTITUDE WAS RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OR TO SIT ON THE FENCE
CAMPAIGNERS WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE E.U. ARE CALLING FOR BIG CHANGES TO THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IF BRITAIN VOTES FOR BRECHT'S IT THEY SAY THE AUTOMATIC RIGHT OF E.U. CITIZENS TO WORK HERE WILL END AND A POINTS BASED SCHEME SIMILAR TO THAT USED IN AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE INTRODUCED THE T.U.C. WHICH SUPPORTS THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN AS WARNED THAT MANUFACTURING JOBS WOULD GO AND WAGES WOULD FALL IN THE LONG TERM IF BRITAIN LEAVES OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT BEN WRITE REPORTS
BOTH SIDES KNOW THE REFERENDUM RESULT COULD HINGE ON LOWER PAID WORKERS MANY OF THEM TRADITIONAL LABOUR VOTERS THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAYS THE CONTINUED RIGHT OF THE WORKERS TO COME TO BRITAIN WITH FURTHER SQUEEZE THE WAGES OF PEOPLE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN A STATEMENT WRITTEN BY AMONG OTHERS BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO
VOTE LEAVE SETS OUT PLANS FOR EXTENDING THE POINTS BASED SYSTEM TO ALL MIGRANTS COMING TO THE U.K. BY TWENTY TWENTY THEY SAY THAT WOULD RESTORE TRUST IN POLITICS BY INCREASING CONTROL OVER IMMIGRATION NUMBERS AND ENSURE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS HAD THE SKILLS BRITAIN NEEDED BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THIS WOULD BE THE SYSTEM ADOPTED IF BRITAIN LEFT THE E.U. AND THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN SAID INTRODUCING A POINTS BASED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WOULD TAKE BRITAIN OUT OF THE SINGLE MARKET WHICH WOULD WRECK THE ECONOMY
TODAY THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE TRADES UNION CONGRESS FRANCES O'GRADY WILL LAUNCH HER ORGANISATION'S LATEST APPEAL TO WORKERS PUBLISHING A REPORT THAT PREDICTS LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD RESULT IN AVERAGE WAGES BEING THIRTY EIGHT POUNDS LOWER A WEEK THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BY TWENTY THIRTY ADJUSTING WAGES FOR SMALLER G.D.P. GROWTH THE T.U.C. ALSO SAYS EMPLOYEE RIGHTS AND MANUFACTURING JOBS IN PARTICULAR WOULD BE HIT THE BATTLE FOR THIS SLICE OF THE ELECTORATE COULD BE CRUCIAL
NEW EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED OF LENGTHY DELAYS IN DIAGNOSING AND TREATING PEOPLE WITH MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE A SURVEY OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND WHO HAVE THE ILLNESS FOUND A FIFTH HAD TO WAIT MORE THAN A YEAR TO SEE A SPECIALIST AFTER GOING TO THEIR G.P. IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM BRILLO
MORE THAN HALF OF PEOPLE WITH MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE DIE WITHIN TWO YEARS OF DIAGNOSIS THERE'S NO CURE FOR TREATMENT CAN EASE THE SYMPTOMS SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO AVOID DELAYS MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE WITH M.N.D. TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT OF THOSE CONTACTED RESPONDED TO THIS SURVEY OF THESE ONE IN FIVE HAD TO WAIT AT LEAST A YEAR TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST AFTER THEIR FIRST G.P. VISIT
TWO IN FIVE WENT TO THEIR G.P. AT LEAST THREE TIMES BEFORE REFERRAL WAS MENTIONED AND MENTEE SYMPTOMS ARE SIMILAR TO OTHER CONDITIONS SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR G.P.S BUT THE SURVEY SUGGESTED A SCHEME TO HELP THEM SPOT SIGNS EARLIER HERE'S HAVING SOME SUCCESS THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF G.P.S SAYS EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF M.N.D. IS ESSENTIAL TO GIVE PATIENTS THE BEST CHANCE OF KEEPING WELL FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR FAMILY DOCTORS TO IDENTIFY ESPECIALLY IN A STANDARD TEN MINUTE CONSULTATION
INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES SUCH AS SOLAR WIND AND HYDRO REACHED RECORD LEVELS AROUND THE WORLD LAST YEAR THE ENERGY POLICY GROUP WHEN TWENTY ONE FOUND THE AMOUNT SPENT WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT ON NEW COAL AND GAS FIRED POWER PLANTS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EMERGING ECONOMY SPENT MORE THAN RICH COUNTRIES OUR ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT MATT MCGRATH HAS MORE
THE U.K. HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN GREEN POWER OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS ACCORDING TO THE STUDY IT WAS THE WORLD'S FOURTH BIGGEST SPENDER ON RENEWABLES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BEHIND ON THE CHINA THE U.S. AND JAPAN INVESTMENT HELPED WIND AND SORT OF SAUCES TO SUPPLY AROUND A QUARTER OF THE U.K.'S ELECTRICITY IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR
THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT CUTS TO GREEN ENERGY SUBSIDIES OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS SUPPORT FOR SOLAR POWER ALONE HAS BEEN REDUCED BY MORE THAN SIXTY PER CENT THE REPORTS OR TO SAY THIS IS BUCKING THE GLOBAL TREND WHERE EVEN THE POOREST COUNTRIES ARE BOOSTING THEIR SPENDING ON WIND SOLAR AND HYDRO
NOT EVERY SECTOR IS TURNING GREEN FOR TRANSPORT HEATING AND COOLING THE LOW PRICE OF OIL MEANS THAT FOSSIL FUELS STILL REMAIN THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ENERGY
M.P.S HAVE CRITICISED PLANS TO BUILD A BIG LORRY PARK NEAR THE M. TWENTY IN KENT TO DEAL WITH CONGESTION WHEN CROSS CHANNEL SERVICES ARE DISRUPTED THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSED THE IDEA AFTER THOUSANDS OF LORRIES WERE PARKED ON THE MOTORWAY LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS AT A FRENCH FERRY STRIKE
DONALD TRUMP HAS LASHED OUT AT POLITICAL JOURNALIST COVERING HIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENCY DESCRIBING THEM AS DISHONEST SPEAKING AT AN EVENT IN NEW YORK HE SAID THE MEDIA SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR WHAT HE SAID WAS THE BAD PUBLICITY HAD RECEIVED FOR HIS FUNDRAISING FOR VETERANS ARE NEW YORK CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT WAS THERE
IT'S COMMON FOR DONALD TRUMP TO ATTACK THE PRESS IT'S A STAPLE OF HIS CAMPAIGN STUMP SPEECH HAD ALWAYS GETS APPLAUSE FROM HIS SUPPORTERS THAT A NEWS CONFERENCE AT TRUMP TOWER HE LAUNCH PERHAPS HIS MOST SAVAGE ASSAULT ON REPORTERS YET CALLING ONE A SLEAZE AND ANOTHER A LOSER I FIND THE PRESS TO BE EXTREMELY DISHONEST I FIND THE POLITICAL PRESS
TO BE UNBELIEVABLY DISHONEST I WILL SAY THEY'RE ASKED WHETHER THIS WAS HOW HE PLANNED TO CONDUCT RELATIONS WITH THE MEDIA IF HE WERE TO BECOME PRESIDENT HE SAID IT WAS BUT ONE OF THE JOURNALISTS WHO WAS ATTACKED BY MISTER TRUMP HIT BACK BY DESCRIBING THE BILLIONAIRE AS A ROARING JACKASS
JAPANESE SOLDIERS HAVE JOINED THE SEARCH FOR A SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY WHO'S BEEN MISSING IN MOUNTAINS SINCE SATURDAY WHEN HIS PARENTS ABANDONED HIM AS A PUNISHMENT THE COUPLE HAVE TOLD POLICE THEY LEFT THE BOY FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES BUT HE WAS GONE WHEN THEY RETURNED THE MOUNTAINS ON THE ISLAND OF HOKKAIDO ARE KNOWN TO BE HOME TO BEARS
THE WORLD'S LONGEST AND DEEPEST RAIL TUNNEL WILL BE OFFICIALLY OPENED IN SWITZERLAND TODAY AFTER ALMOST TWO DECADES OF CONSTRUCTION WORK THE GOD HARD TUNNEL IS JUST OVER THIRTY FIVE MILES LONG AND IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A HIGH SPEED LINK FOR FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS FROM ROTTERDAM IN THE NETHERLANDS TO GENOA IN ITALY IMAGING FOLKS REPORTS
THE TUNNEL HAS COST SWITZERLAND THE EQUIVALENT OF MORE THAN EIGHT BILLION POUNDS BUT THE SWISS ARE SURE IT IS WORTH IT THE HEAVY LORRIES WHICH TRUNDLE THROUGH THEIR ALPINE VALLEYS SHOULD NOW MOVED TO RAIL
OLDER TUNNELS CORKSCREWED SLOWLY UP THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS THAN YOU'VE GOT TIGHT IS ENTIRELY STRAIGHT AND FLAT
TRAINS WILL RACE THROUGH AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR AND THE PRESENCE OF CHANCELLOR MERKEL OF GERMANY AND FRANCE AS PRESIDENT ON TODAY'S OFFICIAL OPENING SHOWS THAT THE YEW TUNNEL IS ABOUT MORE THAN PROTECTING THE ALPINE ENVIRONMENT
EUROPE'S GOODS HAVE TO CROSS THE ALPS NOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO WHAT QUICKLY AND MORE CHEAPLY
POLICE IN THE U.S. CITY OF CINCINNATI HAVE BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SHOOTING OF A GORILLA TO ZOO HE'LL FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON THE CONDUCT OF THE PARENTS OF A THREE YEAR OLD BOY WHO MANAGED TO GET INSIDE THE ANIMAL'S ENCLOSURE ZOO OFFICIALS SHOT THE GORILLA FEARING IT WAS GOING TO HARM THE BOY PROMPTING WIDESPREAD CONDEMNATION
THANK YOU IT IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN EVERY DAY IN THE U.K. ARE SIX PEOPLE ARE DIAGNOSED WITH MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE IT'S A HORRIBLE CONDITION IT CAN OFF OFTEN TAKE HOLD OF A PERSON WITH GREAT SPEED IF IT'S DIAGNOSED CORRECTLY IT CAN BE TREATED OR AT LEAST THE SYMPTOMS CAN BE TREATED AND PEOPLE SUFFERING CAN BE REDUCED BUT THERE'S A WARNING TODAY THAT THE DIAGNOSIS IS OFTEN NOT FAST ENOUGH BOB KEATS WAS DIAGNOSED WITH MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE AFTER A TWELVE MONTH WAIT AND HAS BEEN LIVING WITH IT NOW FOR A YEAR
FROM THE FIRST DON'T HAVE SYMPTOMS GOING THROW THROWS WITH ME OLOGIST THROUGH
AND THAT WAS ONLY AFTER THAT THEY'LL KNOW THERE'S A VINCE'S SAYS THAT I'M A DENTIST HOME BEING PICKED UP BY THE ZOO PLEASE REFER ME TO BEING THERE ISN'T VOTES VOTERS
I HAD A VOTE AND THIS IS A SORT OF BUT THAT WASN'T ME ON THE LINE
I WAS BOB KEATES SOPHIE KEATS BOB'S DAUGHTER IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THAT THEY HAPPENED WHEN DID YOU FIRST
BEGIN TO REALISE THAT THE THINGS THAT WERE BEING ADDRESSED THAT POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT WERE BEING SUGGESTED JUST WEREN'T WENT ADDRESSING THE ROB
UM IT WAS AROUND CHRISTMAS TWENTY FOURTEEN WE REALISE THAT THERE ARE SOME BIZARRE THINGS THAT DAD CAN WOULD DO AND HE WAS STRUGGLING TO SAY THE WORD CLEAN YOU COULDN'T WHISTLE VERY WELL BUT THOSE SYMPTOMS ARE
NOTHING YOU WOULD THINK OF TO DO WITH ANYTHING TOO LIKE THE MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE IN ITSELF IT'S WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE THOSE DISEASES YOU THINK THAT THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR FEET OR THEIR HANDS SO MY DAD'S SYMPTOMS WERE EVEN MORE OBSCURE
SO IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO NOW AND WHEN HE WENT TO THE G.P. WHAT WAS SAID TO
IT WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE HE WAS GOING WITH WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE SORE THROATS AND PROBLEMS WITH HIS SPEECH SO THEY WERE TREATING THE IMMEDIATE SYMPTOMS HE HAD
HE SAW E.N.T. SPECIALISTS AND THEY HAD NO SURGERY ON HIS SINUSES THEY WERE TREATING IMMEDIATE PROBLEM BUT THEY DIDN'T REALISE WHAT WAS UNDERLYING THOSE PROBLEMS AND IT WAS A FULL YEAR BEFORE HE SAW A NEUROLOGIST YEAH HE WAS HE SAW THE G.P. AND HE SAW E.N.T. SPECIALISTS BUT THE NEUROLOGIST TOOK ABOUT A YEAR TO DIZZY AND ONCE HE'D SEEN THE NEUROLOGIST WAS THERE THEN TREATMENT OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT COULD MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE TO
AS SOON AS THE NEUROLOGIST HAD SEEN HIM AND THEY TESTED FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE THE WAY THE ENERGIES AND HIS DIAGNOSES BECAUSE AFTER RULE OUT OTHER THINGS BUT THEY'RE ONLY TREATMENT HE TOOK AND ACTUALLY DIDN'T REALLY HELP HIM SO HE HE STOPPED TAKING ONE PROPER MEDICATION HE WAS
AND PRESCRIBES BUT THE CARE WAS REALLY GOOD ONCE IT WAS DIAGNOSED HE SAW SPEECH THERAPISTS AND PHYSIOTHERAPISTS AND DIETICIANS AND THEY WERE REALLY REALLY HELPFUL YEAH SO IT'S NOT A MATTER OF TAKING A DRUG OR SOMETHING IT'S ACTUALLY BEING DEALT WITH AND HELP TO COPE WITH THE CONDITION YEAH EXACTLY SO THE MAIN PROBLEM MY DAD HAS IS HIS
HIS SPEECH AND HIS SWALLOWING CHEWING FOOD SO IT WAS REALLY NICE TO SEE SPEECH THERAPIST AND PEOPLE THAT COULD HELP HIM WITH THOSE PROBLEMS RATHER THAN MOBILITY
SOPHIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S TALK TO DOCTOR BRYANT DICKIE IS NEAR A SCIENTIST DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH ETCH IN THE MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE ASSOCIATION GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR G.P.S ISN'T IT BECAUSE AS WE WERE HEARING THEIR SORE THROAT AND OTHER KIND OF ALMOST RANDOM SOUNDING CONDITIONS IT'S THE NEED TO TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER
G.P.S DON'T SEE MANY CASES OF MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE AND THEIR PROFESSIONAL CAREERS THE ONLY COME ACROSS ONE OR TWO AND INCORRECT REFERRAL IS RELATIVELY COMMON UNFORTUNATELY WE FIND THAT ALMOST HALF OF CASES ARE INITIALLY REFERRED TO ANOTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL IT COULD BE EAR NOSE AND THROAT IT COULD BE ORTHOPAEDICS IT COULD BE A RHEUMATOLOGIST
IT SEEMS TO BE PARTICULARLY THE CASE FOR THOSE AGED EIGHTY FIVE OR OVER WHERE THE INITIAL SYMPTOMS OF M.N.D. MAY BE PRESENT ALONGSIDE OTHER EXISTING CONDITIONS WHAT CAN WE DO TO TO UP HER GAME
WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TILLY ONE IS A DILLY IN THE PATIENT FIRST NOTICING SYMPTOMS AND VISITING THE G. P. THEY MAY THINK OH I'M JUST GETTING CLUMSY
I'M GETTING OLDER SO THERE'S A GENERAL AWARENESS RAISING ISSUE WHICH IS WHY WE ARE LUNCHING M.N.D. AWARENESS MONTH TODAY THERE IS A DELAY IN THE G.P. RECOGNISING THAT THIS COULD BE
A NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION AND THEREFORE REFERRING TO A SPECIALIST WE RUNNING SOMETHING CALLED THE RED FLAG'S INITIATIVE WITH THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS TO INCREASE G.P. AWARENESS OF SOME OF THE KEY FEATURES OF THE DISEASE BUT ALSO SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT DON'T OCCUR IN THE DISEASE SO THAT THE G.P. CAN HOPEFULLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS WHAT SHOULD THEY BE LOOKING OUT FOR HER WHAT COMBINATIONS OF SYMPTOMS SHOULD THEY INDEED INDIVIDUALS PEOPLE BE LOOKING OUT
HE CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE PART OF THE BODY THAT'S AFFECTED FIRST BUT FOR EXAMPLE IT'S ME B. BUT THERE'S MUSCLE WASTING OCCURRING A TWITCHING OF SMALL GROUPS OF MUSCLES CALLED FOR SITUATION CRAMPING CAN BE CAN OCCUR
IF IT OCCURS IN THE MUSCLES INVOLVED IN SPEECH AND SWALLOWING AS IT SOUNDS LIKE SOPHIE'S FATHER INITIALLY MAYBE HEARD THERE COULD BE SLURRED SPEECH OR QUIET SPEECH SOMETIMES DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING AND ONCE AGAIN FOR SECURE NATIONS ARE TWITCHING OF THE TONGUE IN PARTICULAR AND
THERE ARE SOME FACTORS SWITCH WILL NOT BE PRESENCE OR BLADDER A BOWL INVOLVEMENT IS USUALLY O.K. AND YOU DON'T TEND TO HAVE ANY SENSORY SYMPTOMS OCCURRING EITHER
AND WHAT WE WERE HEARING FROM SOPHIA'S LLOYD IT'S NOT A MATTER OF GIVING DRUGS THAT CAN DO MUCH GOOD BUT AN ENORMOUS BENEFIT THERE CAN COME FROM THERAPY IF IT'S OFFERED
UNFORTUNATELY AT THE MOMENT THE TREATMENT IS LARGELY PALLIATIVE ADDRESSING HER VARIOUS SYMPTOMS THAT CAN OCCUR AS THE DISEASE PROGRESSES AND THIS IS QUITE A RAPIDLY PROGRESSING TIZZY'S SO EARLY DIAGNOSIS WOULD MEAN THAT THERE IS MORE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN THE SPECIALIST MULTI DISCIPLINARY CARE THAT'S REQUIRED DOCTOR BRIAN DECADE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT THE MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE ASSOCIATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS TO SOPHIE
SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW WE SHALL KNOW IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS WHETHER THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW INQUEST INTO THE BIRMINGHAM PUB BOMBINGS MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AGO TWENTY ONE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND INQUEST WAS OPENED SOON AFTERWARDS BUT THEN ADJOURNED WENT SIX MEN WERE TRIED AND CONVICTED OF THE MURDERS WRONGLY CONVICTED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THEY WERE SET FREE THANKS IN PART TO INVESTIGATIONS PURSUED BY CHRIS MULLIN WHO WAS A JOURNALIST AT THE TIME YOU SINCE WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT CALLED ERROR OF JUDGEMENT AND THEN BECAME AN M.P. HE'S ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
AS SHOCKING ERROR OF JUDGEMENT IS SHOCKING WELL HER MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE WELL ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN BRITISH HISTORY AND IT HAD BIG IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DAY FOR THE BRITISH JUDICIAL LEGAL SYSTEM SO
WELL I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE RELATIVES THE LOVED ONES OF THE VICTIMS WANT AT THE INQUEST TO BE REOPENED BUT IN PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT CAN IT ACHIEVE GIVEN THAT WE WE KNOW WHO THE REAL KILLERS WERE AND INDEED SOME OF THEM ARE STILL ALIVE AND WALKING AROUND DUBLIN AND EVERYBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE SO WHAT IS TO BE ACHIEVED BY REOPENING THE INQUEST
THAT'S BEEN PUT ABOUT BY THE FORMER CALLS HIMSELF FORMER HEAD OF INTELLIGENCE AT THE I.R.A. HE'S A LAWYER
YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF POINT IN REOPENING THE INQUEST BUT YOU CAN SEE FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF THE RELATIVES THAT THEY WANT SOME SORT OF HORRIBLE WORD BUT SOME SORT OF CLOSURE
CHRIS MULLIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN TODAY MARKS A BRAND NEW CHAPTER FOR THE NEW OWNERS OF TATA STEEL'S BUSINESS IN SCUNTHORPE ROB HAS MORE YES THE GREY ABLE CAPITAL HAS OFFICIALLY BECOME THE NEW OWNER OF TATA STEEL'S LONG PRODUCTS BUSINESS AFTER AGREEING TO BUY IT FOR JUST A POUND
IT EMPLOYS FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE MOSTLY IN SCUNTHORPE WITH OTHER MANUFACTURING SITE THROUGHOUT NORTHERN ENGLAND AND FRANCE AND THE COMPANY NOW HAS A NEW TRADING NAME BRITISH STEEL REVIVING A BRAND THAT HASN'T BEEN AROUND SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND WITH US IS THE COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR OF BRITISH STEEL PETER HOGG GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHY DID YOU CHOOSE A COMPANY NAME THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECLINE OF THE STEEL INDUSTRY
I THINK WE DISAGREE WITH THAT WE THINK IT'S ICONIC IN FACT SOME OF MY CUSTOMERS WHEN WE ANNOUNCE THE NAME WERE REALLY REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT NOT JUST IT CUSTOMERS IN THE U.K. FROM ACROSS THE WORLD
WHAT THEY THINK IT STANDS FOR HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS AND FANTASTIC PEOPLE WITH HIGH INTEGRITY SO IT WAS IT WAS A NATURAL CHOICE FOR US YOUR BUSINESS HAS BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS WE HAVE HEARD THIS MORNING IS THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS TOOK A PAY CUT AND REDUCED THEIR PENSION CONTRIBUTION
IT'S ONE OF THE ISSUE ONE OF THE REASONS YES THE REASON WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THE PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY IS WE TAKE A WHOLE SERIES OF MEASURES ACROSS ACROSS THE WHOLE BUSINESS SO MAKE OURSELVES MORE COMPACT COST COMPETITIVE
THE EMPLOYEES THEIR TRADE UNION REPS UNDERSTOOD WHAT WHAT WE KNOW WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS SUCCESSFUL AND EVERYBODY WAS COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO THAT SO THEY'VE BEEN A CLEAR PART OF THE PICTURE AS WELL THE STEEL PRICE IS NOW RECOVERING WELL OF THE WORK LIKELY TO GET A PAY RISE THEN TO GET BACK SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THEY'VE LOST
SO WHAT WE'VE SAID IS THAT THAT'S A TEMPORARY MEASURE THAT'S IT THAT'S A TWELVE MONTH THING SO IN TWELVE MONTHS' TIME WE'LL RESTORE THE PEOPLE TO THE TO THE LEVEL THEY WERE AT BEFORE
IT'S A BIT OF TARTAR THAT YOU HAVE BOUGHT IS MAKING MONEY WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE TO BE DONE AT PORT TALBOT AND OTHER SITES AND WHETHER THEY COULD HAVE A VIABLE FUTURE
SO I THINK FOR US BRITISH TAILED THAT THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE HAD TO MAKE I THINK DOESN'T ALIGN THAT IF YOU'VE GOT GOOD PRODUCTS YOU'VE GOT GOOD PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PLAN YOU CAN MAKE A SUCCESS OF THE BUSINESS I THINK IT'S NOT REALLY FOR US TO SAY WHAT WHAT THE STORY IS FOR THE REST OF THE U.K. BUSINESS THOUGH BUT YOU MANAGED TO TURN AROUND A PART OF THE U.K. STEEL MAKING INDUSTRY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THE OTHER PART THAT TARTARUS SELLING
WHO ALERT THAT'S NOT REALLY A QUESTION FOR US HERE TODAY BUT BRITISH DEER WHERE COMPLETELY FUNKE FOCUSED ON MAKING THIS BUSINESS SUCCESS THAT'S GOT OUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION AND THAT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAR FOCUS TODAY
O.K. THANK YOU PETER PETER THE COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR OF BRITISH STEEL I'LL BE A FLAG RAISING CEREMONY AT THE SCUNTHORPE STEELWORKS ABILITY THIS MORNING THEY WERE ALL BUT IT'S TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN GUESS HOW LONG HAVE THE WORLD'S LONGEST RAIL TUNNEL IS
HOW ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILES OR IF YOU PREFER FIFTY SEVEN KILOMETRES THAT IS THE LENGTH OF THE GOT BASED TUNNEL IN SWITZERLAND AND IT IS BEING OFFICIALLY OPENED TODAY I'M JOINED BY A MAN WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT TUNNELLING MARTIN KNIGHT SEEMS THE BOSS OF AN INTERNATIONAL TUNNELLING COMPANY BALDING CROSSRAIL OF H. S. TWO HOMES OF LOFT BUT TUNNELLING IN SWITZERLAND AS WELL AND THAT'S THE POINT ABOUT THIS ISN'T IT MARTIN THAT IT CAN THIS TUNNEL WILL TAKE TRAINS AT ROTTERDAM AND GO ROARING THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO
WHERE IS IT SOMEWHERE OOPS EXCEPT SOUTH OF THE SOUTH OF THE ALPS THE ALPS SO CUTTING OUT THE ALPS WHAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO ALL THOSE NICE LITTLE ALPINE VILLAGES THAT'S RIGHT THIS IS PART OF A SERIES OF A NUMBER OF MYSTERIES YOU RODE THAT EUROPEAN
EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS WERE INVOLVED IN THE HARDEST TO HELP TRAIN BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH OF OF EUROPE AND OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TRAFFIC OFF THE ROAD A GROCERY SWITZERLAND AT THE MOMENT CAUSING TRAFFIC JAMS FATALITIES ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AS WELL SO HE'S SAVING FOR A GREATER GOOD OF SWITZERLAND BUT IT'S ALSO SAVING FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF EUROPE AS WELL AND WHAT A HECK OF A JOB IT'S BEEN IT IS HOME
IN CRUDE TERMS IT'S ACTUALLY WITH THE PYRAMIDS IN TERMS OF A CHEEK PICK US HOW WE WERE SAYING EARLIER FOR THE AMOUNT OF ROCK THAT THEY TUNNELLED OUT YOU COULD'VE BUILT FOR PYRAMIDS WILL INDEED AND WITH A MACHINE THIS WOULD BE THE FOR MACHINES THAT ARE BEING EXCAVATED THE TUNNELS THEY WERE FINISHED IN TWO THOUSAND SO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS AS A CUTTING OUT OF THE TUNNEL AND IT SHOULD BE OPEN FOR OPERATION LATER ON THIS YEAR EARLY NEXT YEAR
AND IT'S ONE OF THREE TUNNELS HAVE BEEN BUILT ACROSS THE UNDER UNDERNEATH THE ALPS THERE'S ANOTHER TWO BEING CONSTRUCTED A MOMENT ONE ON HIS MEAN PLAN BETWEEN TURIN LEON AND THE OTHER ONE IS STARTED CONSTRUCTION WHICH IS A GRANITE BASE TUNNEL BETWEEN INNSBRUCK HANDOVER OWNER SO THESE THIS IS JUST ONE PART OF MAKING SURE THAT TRANSITING THE ALPS IS GOING TO BE A LOT QUICKER A LOT SAFER IT'LL TRANSFORM THE ALPS
IT'LL SELL IT'LL CERTAINLY HAVE AN IMPACT IN REDUCING FREIGHT TRAFFIC THAT'S THE MAIN THING AT THE MOMENT THAT'S ONE BOSWELL INDEED LORRIES IT IS AND IF YOU'RE A CITIZEN OR SWITZERLAND OR YOU SEE THESE BIG LORRIES COMING THROUGH AND IN FACT
THE LORRIES ARE CASUALLY GOING FROM GERMANY OR WHEREVER DOWN TO ITALY NOT ACTUALLY MEANT FOR SWITZERLAND HE WELCOME THIS ACTUALLY SO WHEN THE HOUSE WHEN THE CITIZENS OF SWITZERLAND VOTED FOR THIS IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THEY DID SO BY AN UP MUST MAJORITY OF ABOUT EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT SO THIS HAD POLITICAL PUBLIC BACKING AS WELL OBVIOUSLY FOR THAN ENGINEERS POINT OF VIEW WE'VE NOW GOT THESE MASSIVE MACHINES THAT GO BORING THROUGH AND THAT MAKES IT SOUND ENTIRELY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLE
BUT HE'S PROBABLY NOT WELL IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT BUT AT LEAST IT I MEAN THE B. B. C. T. V. PROGRAMMES COUPLE OF YEARS AGO LOOK ROM THAT FEATURED IN A BUILDING OF CROSSRAIL ACTUALLY HELP TO IMPROVE THE IMAGE OF THE TUNNELLING INDUSTRY COS I MEAN MOST PEOPLE THINK IT'S BOB THE BUILDER AND EXPLAIN IT BUT WILL BURROUGHS RAM WHO TALK ABOUT HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED MACHINES THAT CAN ACTUALLY DRILL TO AN ACCURACY OF TWO MILLIMETRES AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THE ACCURACY WAS OF THE TUNNELS THAT MET UP IN THE GUT ODD IT WAS MICK HOPES HER FOUR MILLIMETRES
AND THAT'S THE OLD JOKE ISN'T IT YOU BUILD TO FLOP BUT START FROM EITHER END UP WITH TWO TOLLS CLINT A.J. NEVER MEET IN THE MIDDLE YES NOT A TRACE THOSE DAYS OF GOD IF THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY AND THERE'S LOTS MORE PLANNED FOR THE FUTURE IN THE CHINESE ARE NOW THINKING ABOUT ON UP THINKING THEY'RE PLANNING A TUNNEL CROSSING BETWEEN TAIWAN AND THE MAINLAND OF CHINA SO THAT WOULD BE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY KILOMETRES IN LENGTH SO AS THE IMPROVEMENT IN TECHNOLOGY GROWS THE CERTAINTY IN THE IN MITIGATION OF RISK COMING OUT QUITE WELL
AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF BUILDING TELLS IT ALL NEEDED IN ORDER TO KEEP TRAY GOING THESE ARE THE MODERN DAY EQUIVALENTS OF THE SILK ROAD SO ONE OF THESE DAYS WE'LL SEE NO LORRIES ON THE ROADS AT ALL BUT THAT'S A BIT MARTIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS TWENTY SIX AND SEVEN AND SONALI IS HERE WITH

LOOK AT THE WEATHER IT'S GOING TO BE CLOUDY PATCHY RAIN IN THE SOUTH AND HE'S WARM SUNSHINE THOUGH ELSEWHERE YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS NOW FROM THE OLD SLEET A CORONER WILL DECIDE TODAY WHETHER THE INQUEST INTO THE DEATHS OF TWENTY ONE PEOPLE IN THE BIRMINGHAM PUB BOMBINGS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR SHOULD BE RESUMED ITS THOUGHT THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT BY THE I.R.A.
THE ORIGINAL INQUEST WAS ADJOURNED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE FOLLOWING THE CONVICTIONS OF SIX MEN WHO WERE LATER CLEARED THE CORONER REVIEWING THE CASE SAYS SHE'S RECEIVED WHAT SHE DESCRIBED AS SIGNIFICANT NEW MATERIAL
BOATS LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS ARE CLAIMING THAT HER BRECK'S IT COULD DELIVER AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT IS FAIRER AND BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY THEY SAY WAGES ARE LOWER BECAUSE OF FREE MOVEMENT ACROSS THE E.U. HAD A CALLING FOR A POINTS BASED SYSTEM SIMILAR TO AUSTRALIA FOR ALL MIGRANTS THE T.U.C. WHICH SUPPORTS THE CAMPAIGN TO REMAIN AT SAID WAGES WOULD FALL IN THE LONG TERM IF THERE WAS A BREAKS IT
THERE'S NEW EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING TOO LONG TO BE DIAGNOSED AND TREATED FOR MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE A SURVEY CARRIED OUT IN ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND SUGGESTS IT WAS MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE HER FIFTH OF PEOPLE WERE REFERRED TO A SPECIALIST AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF G.P.S SAYS EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS ESSENTIAL BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR FAMILY DOCTORS TO IDENTIFY SIGNS OF THEIR CONDITION
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES ACROSS THE WORLD REACHED RECORD LEVELS LAST YEAR THE ENERGY POLICY GROUP WHEN TWENTY ONE AS THE U.K. WAS THE WORLD'S FOURTH BIGGEST SPENDER BEHIND CHINA THE U.S. AND JAPAN WIND AND SOLAR POWER SUPPLIED AROUND A QUARTER OF THE U.K.'S ELECTRICITY IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR
M.P.S HAVE CRITICISED THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN TO BUILD TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUND LORRY PARK NEAR THE M. TWENTY AND KENT MINISTERS SAY IT WILL HELP EASE CONGESTION ON THE MOTORWAY IF THE SEVERE DISRUPTION TO CROSS CHANNEL SERVICES LABOUR M.P. LOUISE ULLMAN WHO CHAIRS THE TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE TOLD US THAT THE LORRY PARK WOULD BE THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE WORLD AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
JAPANESE SOLDIERS HAVE JOINED THE SEARCH FOR A SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY WHO'S BEEN MISSING IN MOUNTAINS SINCE SATURDAY WHEN HIS PARENTS ABANDONED HIM AS A PUNISHMENT THE COUPLE HAVE TOLD POLICE THEY LEFT THE BOY FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES BUT HE WAS GONE WHEN THEY RETURN
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THE REFERENDUM IS STILL DESPERATELY CLOSE ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT POLLS ON THE EXPERTS ARE SAYING IT WILL BE DECIDED IN THE END BY WHICH WAY TRADITIONAL LABOUR VOTERS GO APPARENTLY MANY OF THEM HAVEN'T DECIDED YET WHICH IS WHY THE T.U.C. IS CALLING ON UNION MEMBERS TODAY TO VOTE AND VOTE TO STAY IN FRANCE'S RADIOS THEIR GENERAL SECRETARY AND SHE'S WITH ME MICK CASH IS THE R. EMPTIES GENERAL SECRETARY HE'S ON THE LINE FOR US
YOUR WARNING YOUR MEMBERS IF WE PULL OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WAGES IN THE U.K. COULD BE THIRTY EIGHT POUNDS A WEEK LOWER HOW DO YOU KNOW
WE BASED OUR REPORT ON PROJECTIONS FROM RESPECTED ORGANISATIONS ECONOMIC FORECASTING ORGANISATIONS ODDS KEEP YOU'RE LOOKING AT A LONG RUN BUT WE'VE GONE FURTHER THAN THAT AND LOOKED AT THE IMPACT ON WAGES AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WORKERS ON AVERAGE COULD BE THIRTY EIGHT POUNDS A WEEK WORSE OFF IN THE LONG RUN BUT WHY
THE KEY ISSUE HERE IS THE IMPACT THAT THE BRICKS IT WOULD HAVE ON INVESTMENT TRADE AND JOBS AND IT'S NOT JUST THOSE PROJECTIONS WEIRD LISTENING TO THE FACTORY FLOOR A UNION REPRESENTATIVES AND COMPANIES LIKE B.M.W. AIRBUS SIEMENS ARE TELLING US THAT THIS WOULD IMPACT ON OUR ORDER BOOKS
ON INVESTMENT AND ULTIMATELY ON JOBS AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO SEE GOOD WELL PAID JOBS IN THE CAR INDUSTRY REPLACED BY THE LIKES OF ZERO HOURS JOBS IN CERTAIN IT'S DIRECT BUT IS TEMPTED TO SAY THEY WOULD SAY THAT WOULDN'T THEY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE T.U.C. HIS JOB IS TO LOOK AT WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF WORKERS PEOPLE MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND ON THE DAY BUT I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO POINT OUT THE REAL DANGERS OF A BRECK'S IT TOO
JOBS PAY AND OF COURSE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS AT WORK BECAUSE LET'S NOT FORGET UNIONS COMBINED OUR FORCES ACROSS BORDERS TO CAMPAIGN FOR MANY OF THE RIGHTS THAT WE RELY ON LIKE EQUAL PAY PARENTAL LEAVE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THE E.U. GUARANTEES THEM IF WE PULL OUT TOO WE TRUST THE GOVERNMENT WE'VE GOT EMPOWERED TO PROTECT ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS THAT AS FAR AS WAGES ARE CONCERNED YOU COULD ARGUE COULDN'T USE THAT
IF OBVIOUSLY IT IS A BIG IF THE BRICKS IT PEOPLE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN WANTING TO CURB IMMIGRATION THAT WOULD PLAY TO THE STRENGTHS OF THE T.U.C. BECAUSE THAT WOULD INCREASE WAGES PAUL I LOOKED AT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN'S PRESS RELEASE THIS MORNING AND THEY'RE NOT PROMISING TO REDUCE IMMIGRATION AT ALL IN FACT I THINK THIS WHOLE DEBATE IS A BIG CON
I DON'T RECALL MANY OF THE PROMINENT LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS STANDING UP FOR THE WALL WORKING PAUL WHEN IT CAME TO THE PAY CAP ON SIX MILLION PUBLIC SERVICE WORKERS OR INDEED THE CUTS TO WORKING TAX CREDIT SO I THINK WE TAKE THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORKING POOR WITH WEATHER A SHOVEL FULL OF SALT SO WHO'S MICK CASH IN THAT CASE WHY DO YOU WANT TO PULL OUT
WELL I MEAN AS A NUMBER REASONS THE E.U. EUROPEAN UNION RATHER THAN EUROPE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN STRONG LINKS WITH FUR TRADE TRAITOROUS ACROSS ALL BORDERS BUT HE USED BEEN PUT PURSUING A STERI POLICIES PRIVATISATION DEREGULATION AND SOCIAL DUMPING ON A MASSIVE SCALE WHAT WAS SEEN AS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM FOR WORKERS SOCIAL DUMPING
CHELSEA SHOULD DUMPING THAT'S WHERE YOU HAD A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE WORKERS OPERATING ACROSS WORKS HAD BEEN USED AGAINST OTHER WORKERS HAVE BEEN PAID LESS
BUT THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT WHATEVER YOU ARE WHATEVER ORGANISATION YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN ISN'T IT OR EVEN IF YOU'RE IN
NO I MEAN HE USED PAPA I'VE OVERSEEN A SITUATION WHERE WORKERS HAVE SEEN THEIR WAGES CUT AND TRADE UNIONS HAVE BEEN STOPPED FROM TAKING INDUSTRIAL ACTION OF FOR EXAMPLE FA FA FA FA FA BENT IT'S A VENT IN THERE AND
THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE FREE MOVEMENT IS USED IN INDIA YOU BUT THE BIG DEBATE HERE BY THE WAY IN IT'S ALWAYS WORRIES ME ABOUT ALL THIS ABOUT EUROPE IS THAT EVERYTHING'S ABOUT WOULD BE WORSE OFF IF WE LEAVE NOT BETTER OFF WE STAY IN AND THE REALITY IS THAT WE AS A TRADE UNION HAVE OPPOSED HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE E.U. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK WORKERS ARE BENEFITING FROM IT AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN
TODAY WITH PRIVATISATIONS WE DE REGULATIONS THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE IN EUROPE IN FRANCE AND BELGIUM AS WE SPEAK WORKERS PROTESTING BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER ATTACK WHERE IN GREECE AND SPAIN FIFTY PER CENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE FIFTY PER CENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED THAT THE E.U. IS IT WORKING FOR US ISN'T WORKING FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE OF WE'VE GOT HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGHER EMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY NOW THAN WE'VE HAD
AT ALMOST ANY TIME IN OUR HISTORY IT'S ALMOST FULL EMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY YOU WORK AT THIS COUNTRY RATHER THAN WORRY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN GREECE WHERE WE ARE REPRESENT THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE FACT IS THAT ACTUALLY WE MIGHT HAVE EMPLOYMENT BUT WE'VE GOT HUGE AMOUNTS OF UNDER EMPLOYMENT WE'VE GOT HOLA SWATHE OF CASUAL ISATION CONTRACTS BUT A POINT FOR ART FOR OUR MEMBERS IS THAT IF YOU TAKE PRIVATISATION
OF THE RAILWAYS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS KEY TO OUR MEMBERS WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE E.U. IS PUMPED FRO WE PACKAGES PROMOTE FURTHER PRIVATISATION AND WILL STOP US PREVENT US FROM NATIONAL ABOUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT I THINK A TURTLE TRAILING MORE THAN THAT IT'S
NO JOHN IT'S MODERN FERRIES IN THE SAME SITUATION ERSCA SCOTTISH PHRASE RECENTLY HAD TO BE PUT OUT TO TENDER BECAUSE DICTATE NEVER HAVE TO TENDER IT LUCKY ENOUGH IT WAS PUT BACK INTO PUBLIC OWNERSHIP BUT IF YOU TAKE A SITUATION FOR A SEAFARER REMEMBERS WHERE A NATION A MARITIME NATION YOU KNOW TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO THIRTY THOUSAND U.K. RAINS TODAY WE'VE GOT EIGHT THOUSAND U.K. RATINGS
THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND SEAFARERS OPERATE IN E.U. WATERS HE WAS ONLY A FORTY PERCENT OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY E.U. NATIONALS AND THAT'S A DISGRACE FRANCE AND GREAT YOU HAVEN'T GOT AN ALL WITH YOU ALL THAT FOR YOU NO LISTEN I THINK WHERE MICK AND I WOULD AGREE IS THERE ARE TOO MANY EMPLOYERS WHO TRY AND UNDERCUT WORKERS BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MEN AND IMMIGRANTS OR MIGRANT WORKERS AGAINST LOCAL WORKERS IT'S MEN AGAINST WOMEN
IT'S USING YOUNG WORKERS TO UNDERCUT OLDER WORKERS IT'S NOT THE FAULT OF MIGRANT WORKERS IT'S THOSE BAD BUS BOSSES THAT WE NEED TO GET TOUGH ON AND WE'VE BEEN CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO DO JUST THAT AND SIGN UP TO THE EUROPEAN PROPOSAL FOR EQUAL PAY FOR WORKERS DOING THE SAME WORK IN THE SAME WORK PLACE IS THE WAY TO DEAL WITH EXPLOIT YOU AND YOU COULDN'T ARGUE WITH THAT COULD YOU MAKE
NO BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU NEED TO GET TWENTY SEVEN HAVEN'T CURRENTLY GOVERNMENTS TO DO THAT LOOK WHAT DAVID CAMERON HAD TO DO TO GET FOUR OR FIVE SMALL ITEMS TO GET THIS REFERENDUM AND AS I WAS ALMOST JOHN BEATHA WAS BACK BEG TO GET THOSE FOUR OR FIVE GOVERNMENTS I KNOW THERE'S A FIG LEAF AN ABSOLUTE FIGURE THE E.U. CANNOT BE REFORMED I MEAN I AGREE WITH FRANCIS FOR EXAMPLE AT THESE SURE ABOUT LOW WAGES OR MIGRATION IS IT'S A CON
BUT THE REALITY IS THIS IS THAT IF I THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD BE REFORMED I'D BE STANDING SOLDIERS SHOULDERS SARN'T WITH FRANCE'S TODAY SAME WITH ME BUT IT CANNOT BE BECAUSE THESE LOT OF RIGHT WING GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS NOT TO BE REFORMED AND A PROGRESSIVE AGENDA FOR WORKERS MICK CASH FRANCES O'GRADY THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THANK YOU THE TIME TWENTY TO EIGHT ALAN DEVORA WHO PAID PLAYED THE ROLE OF SID PERKS IN THE ARCHERS FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS HAS DIED

REFERENDUM THE OTHERS WON'T A CONSERVATIVE PROMISED TO GIVE THEM THE VOTE WAS BROKEN SOME OF THEIR MAIN CAMP HAVE CLAIMED THAT ALL THESE BRITS COULD EFFECTIVELY BECOME ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BREAKS SUPPORTER SAY THAT'S RUBBISH A REPORTER ZOE CONWAY IS IN MY BED THIS MORNING SHE HAS BEEN FINDING OUT WHAT BRITONS WHO LIVE AND WORK THERE MAKE OF THE DEBATE SO FAR
IT'S VERY HOT IT'S GREAT
ENJOY IT THANK YOU
THE BRITISH OWNERS OF THE BLUE POM CAFE REITH AND NIGEL STEVENSON KNEW ALMOST THE MOMENT THEY STEPPED INSIDE THAT THEY WANTED TO BUY IT WE SAT HERE AND LOOKED ACROSS AT THE MEDITERRANEAN HE SAID THIS IS WHERE I'D LIKE TO WORK WHAT PALM TREES AND BLUE SKY IT'S HORRIBLE ISN'T IT
THAT PEOPLE WILL COME AND GO VERY EASILY ABOUT THAT WE CAN WORK HERE WE MOVED FROM LONDON AND JUST OPEN THE RESTAURANT IT WAS ALL VERY EASY COS WE WERE PART OF THE E.U.
WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THAT IT'S ALL VERY NICE FOR YOU BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN BRITAIN WHO YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED FOR THEIR JOBS BECAUSE
MIGRATION I THINK WE'VE HAD THAT FOR YEARS AND ONE SMALL REASON OF US BEING HERE IS MY CLEANING BUSINESS IS JUST REALLY COULDN'T COMPLETE
WITH EASTERN EUROPEANS THAT WERE COMING WE'VE ALWAYS HAD IMMIGRANTS I DON'T AGREE WITH THIS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TURKS ARE GOING TO TAKE EVERY SINGLE JOB IN LONDON I JUST BANK
I'M AT THE BETTER MISTER GOALS CLUB THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE PLAYING AND WE'RE IN A COMMUNITY WHICH IS KNOWN AS LITTLE BRITAIN IT'S NOT HARD TO IMAGINE WHY THERE'S A FISH AND CHIP SHOP ROUND THE CORNER THERE'S A BRITISH BUTCHERS HERE THERE'S AN INDIAN RESTAURANT A CHINESE RESTAURANT
YOU CAN ALWAYS GET AN ENGLISH BREAKFAST OF COURSE THERE'S AN ICELAND NOT VERY FAR AWAY THIS CLUB HAS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MEMBERS AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE BRITISH SO SHEILA HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX
SO WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO COME OUT WE'RE NOT DOING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE BORDERS AND I SEEN OWEN INTO ABOUT THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN YOU COULD SAY THAT YOU'RE BEING A BIT HYPOCRITICAL A BIT UNFAIR COS THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BRITS LIVING IN SPAIN AND THERE ARE PROBABLY MAYBE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SPANISH LIVING IN BRITAIN
WE CAN'T COME HERE AND GET HAND OUTS AND THINGS WE HAVE TO LOOK AFTER OURSELVES AND WE ARE ASSISTING THE SPANISH NUMBER TWO
JEAN COGHLAN MYSELF WHO WIN OVER DENNIS SHAWL AND CLIVE COCKEREL TWENTY DO SIX WHICH WORDS ARE DIFFERENT SEE IF SIXTEEN
THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION THAT A VOTE TO LEAVE COULD LEAD TO EXPAT PENSIONS BEING FROZEN ALL THAT EXPATS COULD STOP PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE HERE I'LL PLUG I'VE LIVED HERE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS JEAN COCKLE AND SAME AS HIM
WE BOTH CONCERNS ABOUT SORT OF MONEY REALLY HELENA AIR PENSION IS IT GOING TO AFFECT THAT WHAT IF THEY GO OUT IT'S JON RICHARDSON
LIVED IN SPAIN ABOUT TEN YEARS IT'S GOOD I DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF SPANISH IN THE U.K. AND THERE'S PLENTY OF BRITS IN SPAIN THEY'LL SORT SOMETHING OUT WHAT ABOUT HEALTH CARE
OF THE HEALTH CARE IT'S GOOD I DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN WHAT'S YOUR NAME JOE
NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SURFIE THERE'S THAT GOLD AFFECT
THE VERY DISAPPOINTING MUSIC BY THEN MATTY NINETEEN SEVENTIES HUGE SIZE OF THE SUN
MARK HAS BEEN SINGING IN THE BARS OF MY BAD FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS HE'S CONFIDENT THAT A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULDN'T AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF BRITS TO LIVE AND WORK HERE
BIT OF PENSIONERS WE OF LIVING OFF THE PENSION THEY ARE NOT TAKING ANYTHING FROM THE STATE YOU'VE GOT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME OVER HERE TO WORK AND THEY WORK AND THEY PAY TAX AND EPISTLE TO SECURITY AND THEY ARE IN THE SYSTEM
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOT MORE MONEY THAN THEM AND THEY OPEN A BUSINESS KNOW THAT AUTOMATICALLY BRINGS EMPLOYMENT AND THEN YOU GET THE SUPER RICH UP IN THE HILLS ON THE MARINOS WHO ARE LIVING OFF THE REMAINS
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT SPANISH GOVERNMENT ARE GOING TO TURN THE WAY THAT I DO
I DON'T KNOW
THAT WAS ZOE COMMON REPORTING FROM MY BEAR WE'LL HEAR AGAIN FROM HER IN THE NEXT PROGRAMME IT IS NOW TEN TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A CAMBRIDGE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS ANNA ATKINS THE WRITER GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING JOHN
JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF WOULD BE BANNED FROM SPEAKING AT TODAY'S UNIVERSITIES IF THEY TOOK LITERALLY HOME OFFICE ANTI TERRORIST GUIDELINES AIMED AT PREVENTING RADICALISATION BY SILENCING EVEN NON VIOLENT EXTREMISTS SO SAID OXFORD PROFESSOR TIMOTHY GARTON ASH SPEAKING ON FREE SPEECH AT HIS BOOK OF THAT NAME AT THIS WEEK'S HAY FESTIVAL
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION VERSIS PROTECTION FROM EXTREMIST IDEAS WHICH MIGHT INCITE VIOLENCE A DIFFICULT BALANCE AND ONE WERE ALMOST BOUND TO DISAGREE ON THE IMPULSE FOR POLITICALLY CORRECT RESTRAINT SPRINGS FROM TOLERANCE AND SENSITIVITY MY FIRST LESSON AND IT CAME AT AN EARLY AGE WHEN MY FATHER SPOTTED IN MY SATCHEL AND MOAT FROM A SCHOOLFRIEND REFERRING TO SOMEONE AS ILLEGITIMATE
HE GENTLY EXPLAINED THE UNKINDNESS OF THE TERM NOT LEAST BECAUSE A MUCH LOVED RELATIVE WAS BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK FASHIONS CHANGE AND I WAS UNCEREMONIOUSLY CUT CLEAN OUT OF A RADIO DISCUSSION FOR ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN THE LATIN WORD FOR BLACK CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS WE ENJOYED AT THE B.B.C.'S MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM ON MONDAY NIGHT DESPITE EXTENSIVE CUTS INCLUDING HELEN AS A SESSION THAT SHE WOULD GLADLY DIE FOR LOVE NOW CONSIDERED AN INAPPROPRIATE SENTIMENT FOR TEENAGE GIRLS TO HERE AND YET AND YET
WE ALL KNOW VOLTAIRE'S CRY FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH DEFENDING TO THE DEATH MY RIGHT TO HEAR SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
I WAS BROUGHT UP IN CAMBRIDGE OUR DINING TABLE FULL OF STUDENTS OFTEN ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ALMOST FOR THE SHEER ACADEMIC FUN OF IT THE FIRST TIME I LIVED OUTSIDE A UNIVERSITY CITY I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND FRIENDS STRUGGLING WITH DEBATE AND OFTEN ASSUMING INTELLECTUAL DESCENT MUST LEAD TO PERSONAL DIVERGENCE TOO TO BE HONEST THE STILL PUZZLES ME
SOME YEARS AGO A LOCAL M.P. AND I WERE ASKED TO DEBATE IN THE OXFORD UNION AGAINST TWO CONTROVERSIAL SPEAKERS DAVID IRVING NICK GRIFFIN I DIDN'T FOR A MOMENT EXPECT TO AGREE WITH EITHER BUT WAS KEEN TO LEARN HOW EACH HAD ARRIVED AT HIS VIEWS ALAS THE RIOTS OF PROTEST OUTSIDE SABOTAGE OR MEANINGFUL DEBATE ALSO IMPRISONING US IN THE BUILDING UNTIL THE EARLY HOURS IRONICALLY YARDS FROM STATUES OF MY LATIMER AND RIDLEY OR BURNT TODAY FOR OUR WORDS
CENSORSHIP OF SUCH HEROES IT'S NOT NEW INCLUDING IN THE NAME OF RELIGION JESUS MIGHT NOT BE WELCOME ON CAMPUS BUT NOR WAS HE IN HIS HOME TOWN SYNAGOGUE OR INDEED ELSEWHERE MAINLY BECAUSE OF HIS MUM TOO SUBTLE CLAIMS TO DIVINITY FOR WHICH SHE WAS EVENTUALLY KILLED
WHEN THEY TRIED TO SILENCE HIS FOLLOWERS A PHARISEE CORKER BALLIOL PERSUADED THE AUTHORITIES IT WASN'T WORTH SUPPRESSING THIS FLEDGLING FAITH WITH TO MY MIND THE LAST WORD ON CENSORSHIP EITHER HAVE THESE IDEAS HE SAID WILL PROVE A FLASH IN THE PAN LIKE SO MANY OTHERS BEFORE THEM AND BUY OUT OF THERE IN A QUART OR THIS MOVEMENT IS FROM GOD
IN WHICH CASE NO POWER ON EARTH NO THREATS OF TORTURE OR MARTYRDOM BURNINGS OR PERSECUTION OR EXECUTION CAN IF I PUT A STOP TO IT
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH AN ATKINS THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO EAT A CHILDMINDER TELLS HER SOCIAL SERVICES THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH HER TWO YEAR OLD AND NURSERY MENTIONS IT AS WELL AS TALK OF A LOSS OF WEIGHT EVEN UNEXPLAINED INJURIES SOCIAL WORKERS MAKE CONTACT BUT SOMEONE GO SICK AND THE CASE FALLS OFF THE RADAR
LIAM FEED IS THEN FOUND DEAD NEAR GLENROTHES IN FIFE HE DIED FROM A PUNCH THAT RUPTURED HIS HEART
YESTERDAY'S MOTHER AND ANOTHER WOMAN WERE FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER AND FIFE CHILD PROTECTION COMMITTEE SO IT WAS OPENING A SERIOUS CASE REVIEW B.B.C.'S LORNA GORDON SPOKE TO DARKNESS DUNLOP FROM THE FIVE CHILD PROTECTION COMMITTEE WHO REPRESENTS HEALTH VISITOR SOCIAL WORKERS AND THE POLICE
WE HAD A RANGE OF AGENCIES INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING LIAM AND HIS FAMILY AND THE DETAILS OF THAT WILL BUILD THAT CUT THROUGH THE SIGNIFICANT KISSED WITH YOU YOU CAN'T CALL IT ANYTHING OTHER THAN A FAILURE
I THINK I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ALL OVER THE SIGNIFICANT CASE REVIEW TO CONSIDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH LIAM
LET'S TALK TO TREASURE HALL WHO WAS MANAGER OF SCOTT OF THE SCOTTISH ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS ON THE LINE UP FROM EDINBURGH GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD LYING IT WAS A FAILURE WASN'T IT PLENTY SOMETHING WENT VERY VERY WRONG BECAUSE VARIOUS AGENCIES KNEW THERE WERE THINGS WRONG IN THIS BOY'S LIFE BUT DIDN'T TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY TRAGIC CASE IT'S A VERY VERY SAD OCCURRENCE AND YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD IN A WAY THAT THEY ARE STILL VERY RARE OCCURRENCES WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL THE SIGNIFICANT CASE REVIEW IS CONCLUDED WHAT COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY WE DO KNOW THAT IN TODAY'S SOCIAL WORK TEAMS THERE IS ENORMOUS PRESSURE AND THE FACT THAT WHEN SOMEBODY GOES OFF SICK THEY CAN'T SIMPLY BE REPLACED IS JUST ONE SYMPTOM OF THAT
IS THAT REALLY THE CASE WHEN SOMEONE GOES THICK THAT THAT MEANS THAT A CHILD OR SEVERAL CHILDREN A CASELOAD OF BEARS IS IS SIMPLY IGNORED UNTIL THEY'RE BACK I WOULDN'T SEE IT IS IGNORE IT AND AS I SAID BEFORE IT IS IF IT'S TOO EARLY AT THIS STAGE TO START MAKING A JUDGEMENT ABOUT WHAT HE PARTICULAR CASE
REALLY WHAT LESSONS CAN BE LEARNT FROM THAT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT SOCIAL WORKERS TODAY WORK UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE WITH CASELOADS THAT REMAIN IMPOSSIBLE EVEN FIVE YEARS AFTER THE REVIEW WHICH PROFESSOR NAILING WE'VE GOT WE HAVE KNOWN THAT AROUND THE U.K. HAVE I HUH FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVE I THINK THAT'S UP TO HARRINGAY AND TWENTY TEN YEAH DONCASTER AND BIRMINGHAM MORE RECENTLY AND THEY'VE BEEN CASES IN SCOTLAND TO HAMPER YES WHAT WILL
AN UPSET PEOPLE DEEPLY IS THAT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE KNOWN THOSE THINGS WE DON'T KEEP SEEMED TO BE CAPABLE OF GETTING TO GRIPS WITH IT I THINK IN MANY WAYS IT'S A POLITICAL ISSUE AND IT'S ALSO A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE
LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN SCOTLAND HAVE SEEING THEIR FUNDING CUT OVER SEVEN YEARS THERE'S NOT BEEN AN INCREASE IN COUNCIL TAX SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE SOMEWHERE THE PREVENTATIVE WORK WHEN SOCIAL WORKERS USED TO BE ABLE TO REFER TO A LOCAL AGENCY OR NURTURE HARP OR ANY KIND OF COMMUNITY BASED FACILITY A LOT OF THOSE VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS HAVE LOST THEIR FUNDING SO THAT WORK IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE SORT OF PREVENTIVE ASPECT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT THIS RELIEF COS YOU MENTION FUNDING A COUPLE OF TIMES IT REALLY IS AS AS
GRIM AS THAT IS IT THAT THE FUNDING FOR SOCIAL WORKERS IS SO POOR THAT THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL WORKERS ARE BEING ASKED TO DO IS SO GREAT THAT THEY CAN'T COPE IT'S ALSO IT'S A KIND OF CHICKEN AND EGG THING WE LIVE IN TIMES OF HUTUS VERITY AND THE IMPACT OF POVERTY IS REALLY BITING
SO YOU KNOW THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT TO BE FAIR HAVE NOT CUT ON CHILD PROTECTION SOCIAL WORK THEY'VE JUST COMMENCED ODD IF YOU STARTED A BIG REVIEW OF A CHILD PROTECTION SYSTEM WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT POLICY ON THE DICK I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT FOR EVERY CHILD POLICY WE HAVE GOOD LEGISLATION BUT DIDN'T NEED OUT THERE IS INCREASING AT A VERY VERY FAST RATE
INCREASING BECAUSE OF AUSTERITY WE BELIEVE THAT TO BE THE CASE WE CERTAINLY HOW SEEING GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY LONG TERM TRAUMA YOU KNOW AND I THINK IT NEEDS A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH AND IT NEEDS VERY VERY DETAILED TRAINING PARTICULARLY AND AREAS OF NEGLECT TO GET THIS RIGHT IS IT ALSO THAT WE
FAIL CULTURALLY TO DO WHAT WE KEEP SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND THAT IS TAKE MORE NOTICE AND NOT JUST IN CASE AN INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL WORKERS BUT THEY'RE FORAGES GENERALLY BEING MUCH MORE MUCH KEENER TO INTERVENE I SUPPOSE THE WAY TO PUT IT IT'S ALSO ABOUT ALLOWING SOCIAL WORKERS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD TO MAKE THE RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE THE FAMILIES WITH THEIR PARENTS SO THAT THEY CAN FIND A WAY IN WHEN WE ARE STILL UNDER THE ILLUSION THAT YOU KNOW YOU GET THE SOCIAL WORKER TO VISIT THEREFORE YOUR CHILD MAY BE TAKEN AWAY BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOTHING IS FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH SOCIAL WORKERS GO INTO THE PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DO GOOD THEY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
SADLY A KIND OF SOCIETY STILL VIEWS US AS A PEOPLE WHO REMOVE CHILDREN WE DON'T WE TRY THE BEST WE CAN TO MAINTAIN A CHILD WITHIN THEIR FAMILY BUT THAT NEED A RELATIONSHIP TO BE BUILT WITH THAT FAMILY WITH THE CHILD WITH THE WIDER COMMUNITY CRUSHER HALL THANKS FOR TALKING TO US AS YOU LOOK
AND THE WEATHER FORECAST ON FLAMING JUNE YES INTERPRET THAT AS YOU WILL TODAY BECAUSE FOR SOME OF US IT'LL BE GLORIOUS FOR OTHERS RATHER GRIM FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND HERE
SOME LOVELY SUNSHINE OR SOME EARLY MORNING FOG PATCHES THEY'LL LIFT AND THEN FOR THE BULK OF SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND SET TO HAVE A FANTASTIC DAY WITH PROLONGED SUNSHINE AND TEMPERATURES GETTING UP INTO THE LOW TO MID TWENTIES IT WILL BE COOLER AND CLOUDIER ACROSS THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND AT TIMES AND RUNNING DOWN THESE COASTS INTO EAST LOTHIAN AND THE BORDERS MORE CLOUD WITH THE BREEZE OFF THE SEA SO TEMPERATURES HELP TO MID TEENS HERE
BUT FOR ENGLAND AND WALES IT'S GREY AND IT'S DAMP AND IT'S DRIZZLY AND FOR MANY PLACES IT'S GONNA STAY THAT WAY ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE DAY WITH THE CHANCE OF THE ODD HEAVIER BURSTS OF RAIN DRIFTING IN OFF THE NORTH SEA INTO PARTS OF EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THAT THERE WILL BE SOME DRIER SPELLS BUT DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR ANY SUNSHINE THAT IS EXCEPT FOR THE FAR WEST OF WALES THE FAR SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND SOME SUNSHINE HERE AND SOME HIGH TEMPERATURES

NEWS READ THIS MORNING BY ME ASLEEP A CORONER WILL ANNOUNCE THIS MORNING WHETHER SHE'LL RESUME INQUEST INTO THE DEATHS OF TWENTY ONE PEOPLE IN THE BIRMINGHAM PUB BOMBINGS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WIDELY THOUGHT TO BE THE WORK OF THE I.R.A. THE ORIGINAL INQUEST WAS ADJOURNED A YEAR LATER WHEN SIX MEN WERE CONVICTED THEY WERE ACQUITTED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE
WEST MIDLANDS POLICE HAS CONSIDERED THE EVIDENCE TWICE SINCE THEN AND THE CORONER WHO'S BEEN REVIEWING THE CASE TOLD HER HEARING LAST MONTH THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT NEW MATERIAL FROM BIRMINGHAM A CORRESPONDENT FOR MACKIE REPORTS
THE BOMBS RIPPED THROUGH THE TWO BIRMINGHAM PUBS THE MULBERRY BUSH IN THE TAVERN IN THE TOWN ON A BUSY THURSDAY EVENING TWENTY ONE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE WERE INJURED
THE BOMBERS HAVEN'T BEEN BROUGHT TO JUSTICE SEVERAL OF THE MEN BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED ARE STILL ALIVE VICTIMS' FAMILIES AND SURVIVORS BELIEVE THE INQUEST IS THE LAST CHANCE THEY'LL GET IN THEIR LIFETIMES TO HEAR EVIDENCE FROM THE POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICES ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED THAT NIGHT
THE BIRMINGHAM CORONER LOUISE HUNT SAYS SOME SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL NEVER PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE HAS ALREADY BEEN SUBMITTED TO HER CAMPAIGNERS HAVE DESCRIBED THE POSSIBILITY OF THE INQUEST BEING RESUMED AFTER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS A SEISMIC
CAMPAIGNERS WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE E.U. ARE CALLING FOR BIG CHANGES TO THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IF BRITAIN VOTES FOR BREAKS IT THEY SAY THE AUTOMATIC WRITER E.U. CITIZENS TO WORK HERE WILL END AND A POINTS BASED SCHEME SIMILAR TO THAT USED IN AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE INTRODUCED A SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH HAS MORE DETAILS
BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO TODAY'S SET OUT WHAT IS IN EFFECT THEIR MIGRATION MANIFESTO NO LONGER WOULD E.U. MIGRANTS BE ALLOWED FREE ACCESS TO THE U.K. INSTEAD THAT HAVE TO HAVE A JOB SKILLS THAT WERE WANTED EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS A DECENT STANDARD OF ENGLISH AND BE IN GOOD HEALTH
THIS NEW POINTS BASED SYSTEM WOULD BE DELIVERED BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION AS WOULD CHANGES TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY'S ACT AND AN OPT OUT FROM THE E. USE CHARTER A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DEPORT UNWANTED MIGRANTS A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA IT SEEMS MISTER CAMERON WOULD BE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW IF HE WANTED TO REMAIN PRIME MINISTER AFTER A BRECHT'S HE'D VOTE
AND CRITICS OF THE FORMER MAYOR ARE LIKELY TO CITE THIS LATEST INTERVENTION AS YET FURTHER EVIDENCE OF MISTER JOHNSON'S DESIRE TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE LEADERSHIP AFTER THE REFERENDUM IT'S MORNING HOWEVER THOSE CLOSE TO THE PRIME MINISTER WERE DISMISSIVE OF HIS PLANS THEY SAID WHILE AN AUSTRALIAN STYLE SYSTEM SEEMED SUPERFICIALLY ATTRACTIVE IT WASN'T SUITABLE FOR THE U.K. WITH PER HEAD OF POPULATION LEVELS OF NET MIGRATION INTO AUSTRALIA MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE U.K.
THEY ALSO ACCUSED BRECHT'S HAD CAMPAIGNERS HAVE BEEN READY TO CRASH THE ECONOMY IN AN EFFORT TO CURB MIGRATION THE T.U.C. WHICH SUPPORTS THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IS WARNING THAT MANUFACTURING JOBS WOULD GO AND EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS COULD BE PUT AT RISK IF BRITAIN LEAVES IT ALSO CLAIMS THAT AVERAGE WAGES WOULD BE THIRTY EIGHT POUNDS A WEEK LOWER BY TWENTY THIRTY THE T.U.C. GENERAL SECRETARY FRANCES O'GRADY TOLD US HOW THE FIGURE HAD BEEN CALCULATED
WE'VE BASED OUR REPORT ON PROJECTIONS FROM RESPECTED ORGANISATIONS ECONOMIC FORECASTING ORGANISATIONS LOOKING AT THE LONG RUN BUT WE'VE GONE FURTHER THAN THAT AND LOOKED AT THE IMPACT ON WAGES AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WORKERS ON AVERAGE COULD BE THIRTY EIGHT POUNDS A WEEK WORSE OFF IN THE LONG RUN
MAKE CASH THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE R.M.T. RAIL UNION WHICH WANTS TO LEAVE SAID HIS COLLEAGUES HAD OPPOSED BEING IN THE E.U. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IT DID NOT BENEFIT WORKING PEOPLE
WHAT WE'VE SEEN TODAY WITH PRIVATISATIONS WE DO REGULATIONS THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE IN EUROPE IN FRANCE AND BELGIUM AS WE SPEAK WORKERS PROTESTING BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER ATTACK WHERE IN GREECE AND SPAIN FIFTY PER CENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE FIFTY PER CENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED THE U. IS IT WORKING FOR US ISN'T WORKING FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE
NEW EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED OF LENGTHY DELAYS IN DIAGNOSING AND TREATING PEOPLE WITH MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE A SURVEY OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND WHO HAVE THE ILLNESS FOUND A FIFTH HAD TO WAIT MORE THAN A YEAR TO SEE A SPECIALIST AFTER GOING TO THEIR G.P. SO IF HE KEEPS HIS FATHER BOB WAITED A YEAR BEFORE HE WAS DIAGNOSED IT WAS DIFFICULT COS HE WAS GOING WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE SORE THROATS AND PROBLEMS WITH HIS SPEECH SO
HE SAW E.N.T. SPECIALISTS AND THEY HAD NO SURGERY ON HIS SINUSES THEY WERE TREATING IMMEDIATE PROBLEM BUT THEY DIDN'T REALISE WHAT WAS UNDERLINE THOSE PROBLEMS
DOCTOR BRIAN DICKIE IS THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT THE MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE ASSOCIATION HE TOLD US IT WAS HARD FOR G.P.S TO SPOT SYMPTOMS IT'S ME B. BUT OTHERS MUSCLE WASTING OCCURRING TWITCHING OF SMALL GROUPS OF MUSCLES CALLED FOR SITUATION CRAMPING CAN OCCUR THIS IS QUITE A RAPIDLY PROGRESSING TIZZY'S SO EARLY DIAGNOSIS WOULD MEAN THERE IS MORE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN THE SPECIALIST MULTI DISCIPLINARY CARE THAT'S REQUIRED
A PRIVATE EQUITY COMPANY HAS BECOME THE NEW OWNER OF A PLANT IN SCUNTHORPE WHICH WAS OWNED BY INDIA'S TATA STEEL AND HAS BEEN RENAMED BRITISH STEEL GRRR ABLE CAPITAL BOUGHT SEVERAL SITES FOR A NOMINAL ONE POUND SAVING THOUSANDS OF JOBS ARE BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT ROB YEUNG REPORTS THIS IS A RARE BIT OF GOOD NEWS FOR AN INDUSTRY IN CRISIS GREY BALL CAPITAL SAYS IT WILL INVEST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IN THE STEELWORKS IN SCUNTHORPE ON TEESIDE AND ELSEWHERE
THE SITE FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED WORKERS TOOK A PAY CUT AND AGREED TO REDUCE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENSURE THE SAIL FROM TATA WENT THROUGH GREAT SAYS THE BUSINESS HAS BEEN MAKING AN OPERATING PROFIT FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS FROM TODAY IT WILL TRADE AS BRITISH STEEL REVIVING THE NAME OF THE FORMER NATIONALISED INDUSTRY BETA HOGGERS IT'S COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR
SOME OF MY CUSTOMERS WHEN WE ANNOUNCE THE NAME WERE REALLY REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT NOT JUST CUSTOMERS IN THE U.K. BUT FROM ACROSS THE WORLD THE REASON WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THE PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY IS WE TAKE A WHOLE SERIES OF MEASURES ACROSS ACROSS THE WHOLE BUSINESS SO MAKE OURSELVES MORE COST COMPETITIVE TARTARE IS STILL TRYING TO SELL IT OTHER U.K. SITES INCLUDING PORT TALBOT THEY EMPLOY ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE
INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES SUCH AS SOLAR WIND AND HYDRO REACHED RECORD LEVELS AROUND THE WORLD LAST YEAR THE ENERGY POLICY GROUP WREN TWENTY ONE FOUND THE AMOUNT SPENT WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT ON NEW COAL AND GAS FIRED POWER PLANTS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EMERGING ECONOMY SPENT MORE THAN RICH COUNTRIES OUR ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT MATT MCGRATH HAS MORE
THE U.K. HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN GREEN POWER OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS ACCORDING TO THE STUDY IT WAS THE WORLD'S FOURTH BIGGEST SPENDER ON RENEWABLES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BEHIND ON THE CHINA THE U.S. AND JAPAN THAT INVESTMENT HELPED WIND AND SORT OF SOURCES TO SUPPLY AROUND A QUARTER OF THE U.K.'S ELECTRICITY IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR
THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT CUTS TO GREEN ENERGY SUBSIDIES OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS SUPPORT FOR SOLAR POWER ALONE HAS BEEN REDUCED BY MORE THAN SIXTY PER CENT THE REPORTS OR TO SAY THIS IS BUCKING THE GLOBAL TREND WHERE EVEN THE POOREST COUNTRIES ARE BOOSTING THEIR SPENDING ON WIND SOLAR AND HYDRO
NOT EVERY SECTOR IS TURNING GREEN FOR TRANSPORT HEATING AND COOLING THE LOW PRICE OF OIL MEANS THAT FOSSIL FUELS STILL REMAIN THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ENERGY
M.P.S HAVE CRITICISED PLANS TO BUILD A GIANT LORRY PARK NEAR THE M. TWENTY AND KENT DEAL WITH CONGESTION WHEN CROSS CHANNEL SERVICES ARE DISRUPTED THE IDEA WAS PROPOSED AFTER THOUSANDS OF LORRIES WERE PARKED ON THE MOTORWAY LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS AND A FRENCH VERY STRIKE
THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS RIGHT TO FIND A PERMANENT SOLUTION AND KEEP KENT MOVING BUT THE CHAIR OF THE TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE LOUISE HELMAN TOLD US THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT HAD PANICKED WHEN FACED WITH A CRISIS THE DEPARTMENT THOUGHT HELP THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WHAT CAN WE DO LET'S BUILD A MASSIVE LORRY PARK
AND THEN CONSULT ON THE DETAIL BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WILL WORK WE DON'T KNOW WHAT REAL IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE ON THE LOCAL AREA NEAR AN AREA OF OUTSTANDING NATIONAL BEAUTY WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE LORRY POT WITHOUT SHOULD BE MANAGED
JAPANESE SOLDIERS HAVE JOINED THE SEARCH FOR A SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY HAS BEEN MISSING IN MOUNTAINS SINCE SATURDAY WHEN HIS PARENTS ABANDONED HIM AS A PUNISHMENT THE COUPLE HAVE TOLD POLICE THEY LEFT THE BOY FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES BUT HE WAS GONE WHEN THEY RETURN
A GAME RESERVE IN TANZANIA COULD LOSE ITS REMAINING ELEPHANTS IN THE NEXT SIX YEARS IF POACHING CONTINUES AT ITS CURRENT RATE A REPORT COMMISSIONED BY THE NATURE CONSERVATION GROUP W.W.F. SAYS THE SALU RESERVE HAS ALREADY LOST NINETY PER CENT OF ITS HEARD DUE TO POACHING ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE ARE AFRICA CORRESPONDENT ALISTAIR LISETTE REPORTS
THE SELLER'S RESERVE IN TANZANIA IS ONE OF THE OLDEST ON THE CONTINENT BUT HAS HAD ITS ELEPHANT POPULATION DECIMATED FOR ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND TO JUST FIFTEEN THOUSAND THE LAST FORTY YEARS AND NINETY PER CENT REDUCTION
THE REPORT RELEASED BY W.W.F. WARNS THAT IF POACHING CONTINUES AT THE CURRENT RATE THE REMAINING ANIMALS COULD BE WIPED OUT IN JUST SIX YEARS THE REPORT BLAMES INDUSTRIAL SCALE POACHING AND WARNS THAT THE LOSS OF WILDLIFE COULD IMPACT AND MULTI MILLION POUND NATURE TOURISM INDUSTRY THE NEW TANZANIAN PRESIDENT AS COMMITTED TO PREVENT FURTHER LOSS OF ITS ELEPHANTS
THE WORLD'S LONGEST AND DEEPEST RAIL TUNNEL WILL BE OFFICIALLY OPENED IN SWITZERLAND TODAY IT GOT HARD TUNNEL IS MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE MILES LONG AND IT'S TAKEN NEARLY TWENTY YEARS TO BUILD THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT THE BIRMINGHAM PUB BOMBINGS WERE THE DEADLIEST TERRORIST ATTACK ON MAINLAND BRITAIN FOR AT LEAST SIXTY YEARS ON ACQUIRED NOVEMBER EVENING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO PUBS WERE BLOWN APART AND TWENTY ONE PEOPLE WERE KILLED
THIS IS A RECORDING OF A TELEPHONE CALL TO THE BIRMINGHAM POST AND MAIL A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE BOMBS WENT OFF YOU POST A MILE THERE WAS A BOG PLANT AT THE ROTUNDA THERE IS A BOMB PLANTED A NEW STREET AT THE TAX OFFICE THIS IS DOUBLE AXE
THE FRONT OF THE MULBERRY BUSH WAS COMPLETELY MISSING THERE WAS BODIES LYING ON THE PAVEMENT BUDDIES OVER SEATS BUT THAT WAS A BIG NO NO IT WAS A MASSIVE NOISE
I STARTED SCREAMING TO THE PAPERCLIP PLUS A SLOY CHAIRS PLUSH COVERED ALL DAY AND THROUGH THE NIGHT MEDICAL TEAMS AT THREE OF THE CITY'S MAIN HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN COPING WITH THE INJURED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED OF THEM SOME OF THEM GRAVELY ILL LAST LINDA DREW BURN
IT'S POINT FLOWING METAL GLASS CONCRETE WOULD LACERATIONS BROKEN BONES THIS IS HORRIFIC
A YEAR LATER SIX MEN WHO WERE SAID TO BE MEMBERS OF THE I.R.A. WERE CONVICTED OF THE MURDERS THEY DENIED IT AND IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THERE APPEAL WAS UPHELD AND THEY WERE SET FREE
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS RELATIVES OF THE VICTIMS HAVE DEMANDED THAT THE INQUEST WHICH WAS ADJOURNED WHEN THE TRIAL WAS HELD SHOULD BE RESUMED AT TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THEY WILL KNOW WHETHER THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO KIERAN CONWAY THE FORMER HEAD OF INTELLIGENCE IN THE I.R.A. WHO IS NOW A LAWYER IN DUBLIN AND JULIE HAMILTON WHO SISTER MAXINE WAS KILLED IN ONE OF THE PUBS
THERE WERE TWENTY ONE PEOPLE THAT WERE COLD BLOODED LEE KILLED ASSASSINATED BLOWN UP AND WE HAVE NEVER BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN INQUEST AN INQUEST WAS OPENED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND IT WAS CLOSED ASTRO I THINK IT WAS A DAY
THEN UP ON THE CAPTURE OF THE MEN WHO BECAME KNOWN AS THE BIRMINGHAM SIX THEY FELT THERE WAS IT WASN'T NECESSARY TO HOLD AN INQUEST AND THEN SIXTEEN YEARS LATER THE MEN KNOWN AS THE BIRMINGHAM SIX WERE RELEASED WHERE THEIR CONVICTIONS WERE QUAD
SINCE THEN BUT THAT PUTS A BIG QUESTION MARK OVER
THE DEATH OF A LOVED ONE
WELL WE DO KNOW DON'T WE THAT THE I.R.A. ADMITTED EVENTUALLY THAT THEY DIDN'T EAT WELL ACTUALLY NO NOT AS FAR AS WE'RE AWARE NO NO TERRORIST ORGANISATION HAS OFFICIALLY EVER ADMITTED IT THE ONLY PERSON WHO DID OFFICIALLY ADMIT IT WHY
KIERAN CONWAY WHO YOU HAVE ON THE OTHER END BUT NO YOU HAVE NOT THE LIKES OF GERRY ADAMS AND MARTIN MCGUINNESS PUTTING THEIR HANDS UP SO IN ESSENCE WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO DID COMMIT THIS CALLOUS
GUTLESS MURDER KIRA COMMON LET ME COME TO YOU ON ON THAT PARTICULAR POINT IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE I.R.A. HAD EFFECTIVELY ADMITTED THESE MURDERS WAS THAT THE CASE OR IS THAT THE CASE
THAT WAS THE CASE IT WAS ADMITTED BY VARIOUS AMOUNT PER PERHAPS THERE WAS NO YOU KNOW THEY'RE SORT OF FORMAL STATEMENT FROM P. ON THE OLD WHICH WAS A NOM DE PLUME USED WHAT USED BY USED FOR THE RELEASE OF I.R.A. STATEMENT BUT IT WAS A BIT ABOUT YOUR CARD OR VARIOUS OTHER EYE LID I R. A. LEADERS LONG BEFORE I REFER TO AT MY BOOK
AND GIVEN THAT THIS HAMBLETON DOES DOES THAT CHANGE YOUR VIEW AT ALL BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO SEE THOSE PEOPLE WHO CARRIED OUT THE MURDERS ARRESTED AND CONVICTED WELL ABSOLUTELY BUT WHAT YOU HEARD WHAT YOUR LISTENERS NEED TO REMEMBER IS
WE DON'T FIGHT FOR TRUTH JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY SAY THEN WHAT WE ARE BASICALLY ENFORCING
ALLOWING HIS FOR ANY FUTURE TERRORIST GROUP HAVE TO COME TO ANY OF OUR GREAT CITIES
AND KILL WITH IMPUNITY WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF RETRIBUTION SO DOES THAT MEAN TO SAY THAT IF WE DON'T FIGHT AND THE AUTHORITIES CAN'T BE BOTHERED THAT AS A SOCIETY WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW ANARCHY TO RULE O.K.
WHAT SORT OF A SOCIETY DO YOU WANT FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN I PURPOSELY DIDN'T HAVE CHILDREN BECAUSE THE LOSS OF HER OTHER CHILD WOULD I NO FINISH ME OFF I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH
BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT MEANS THAT ANYONE CAN KILL ANYONE AND NEVER HAVE TO FEAR ABOUT FACING WITH LAW AND DOING TIME FOR THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT
ISN'T THAT A JOB FOR THE POLICE THE JOB THAT THE POLICE SHOULD BE DOING NOW TRYING TO FIND THESE MURDERERS VERY GOOD POINT YES AND ONE WOULD HOPE THAT THAT IS WHAT THEY DO BUT THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT'S WHEN THE BIRMINGHAM SIX WERE RELEASED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE NOBODY BUT THEY DID AN INVESTIGATION WHICH
MY PURE IVORY IRONY AND COINCIDENCE THEY RAN OUT OF MY NO SO DOES THAT MEAN TO SAY THAT THE LIVES OF OUR LOVED ONES TWENTY ONE INNOCENT PEOPLE THEIR LIVES AREN'T WORTHY OF AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT THE MONEY TO INVESTIGATE
I'M SURE THE BRITISH PUBLIC OUT THERE WOULD BE HORRIFIED TO KNOW THAT THE POLICE AREN'T INTERESTED IN LOOKING FOR THE PERPETRATORS THE MURDERERS OF THIS COLD BLOODED MURDER
MISTER CONWAY YOU SAID YOU WERE PRESIDENT AT A DE BRIEFING OF THE PEOPLE WHO CARRIED OUT THE BOMBINGS THAT DID TAKE PLACE DIDN'T IT
HAS A DEBRIEF DID TAKE PLACE I WAS PRESENT IN THE SAME HOUSE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS TOOK NO PART IN THE ACTUAL DE BRIEF BUT I WAS TOLD BY DAVE O'CONNELL WHO WOULD STAND CHAIRMAN OF THE AYE I P. I R.A. ARMY COUNCIL AND EFFECTIVELY THE LEADER OF THE I.R.A. AFTERWARDS FATTER
HE DID THE MAN HAD TOLD THEM THAT A SERIES OF PHONE BOXES FROM RICHARD A WARNING WE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WRONG END HAD PROVED TO BE AN OPERABLE THEY WERE BROKEN NOT VANDALISED AND THE MEN WHO DID IT
THAT'S TO SAY NOT FOR THE MEN WHO WERE ARRESTED BUT THE MEN WHO ACTUALLY CARRIED OUT THIS ATROCITY THEY FLED FROM BRITAIN THEY CAME BACK THEY WERE DEBRIEFED AS WELL THERE WAS A COURT OF INQUIRY WHICH DIDN'T PROCEED TO THE SECOND LEVEL INDEED I.R.A. H. SYSTEM WHICH WOULD'VE BEEN A COURT MARTIAL WITH POTENTIALLY VERY HEAVY PENALTIES UP TO AND INCLUDING
THEY FULLY ADMIT AT THEIR PART TO THEIR SUPERIORS AT THE COURT OF INQUIRY WERE CLEARED OF ANY WRONGDOING THEY WERE CLEARED OF ANY WRONGDOING SO ARE THOSE IT WAS ACCEPTED THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT SO ARE THOSE MEN WALKING FREE AS WE SPEAK THEY ARE SOMEWHERE DAD THE MAIN ORGANISER MCMURRAY IS INTERRED
OF THOSE TO MY KNOWLEDGE YOUR RUN TOP ON THERE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THE MANY MANY YEARS THERE IS NO PROSPECT OF CONVICTION TO BRITAIN IN THE FIRST PLACE THE MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE'S SIMPLY NO EVIDENCE SECONDLY TO STATE OF IRISH EXTRADITION LAW BACK IN THE SEVENTIES WHICH WOULD BE FOLLOWED NOW WOULD IT WORK WOULD MEAN THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE EXTRADITED MY VIEW
SO THE ONLY WAY THAT THERE COULD BE CONVICTIONS FOR THE PLUMBING I'M BARNES WOULD BE F. ONE OR MORE OF THE BOMBERS WERE TO PRESENT THEMSELVES TO THE U.K. POLICE STATION AND MAKE FULL CONFESSIONS WHEN I DON'T BELIEVE THE DOUBLE UP
BUT YOU KNOW WHO THESE MEN ARE I DO NOT ONLY I DO EVERYBODY DOES THEIR NAMES HAD BEEN IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN SINCE BEFORE AND ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF CHRIS MULLINS' BOOK ERROR OF JUDGEMENT BUT WHATEVER IT WAS
IT WILL SHOCK MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CLOSELY OVER THE YEARS THAT
NOT ONLY ARE THEY WALKING FREE BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO THEY ARE DOESN'T THAT HER PAUL YOU DOESN'T IT DISGUSTING
WELL NOT REALLY I TAKE THE VIEW THAT APPALLING AND ALL OF THE BARNS WHERE THE VOLUNTEERS HAVE CARRIED THEM OUT
RELATIVELY BLAMELESS IN THAT THEY'RE ONLY FAULT AS THEY CARRIED OUT THE INSTRUCTORS OF THE COMMANDER ANDY THE ONLY FAULT WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ELEMENTARY I TRAIN DIDN'T BOMB PLANTED MYSELF AND PLANTED A FEW MY TIME THEY SHOWED UP IN ADVANCE CHEQUE TO THAT THEY HUNT WORKING PHONE BOXES AND A BACKUP IN CASE IN CASE OF DIFFICULTIES BUT THE FACT IS THEY'RE MURDERERS
I DO PHEW I ALREADY VOLUNTEERS AS MURDERERS A FEW THE MOST SO AS PEOPLE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN A JUST WAR JULIE HANDLED A LOT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO THAT WELL I THINK THE MAN'S DELUSIONAL HOW ARE YOU CAN SAY THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT MEN ALL AND WOMEN WE DON'T KNOW PLANNED PRESS
PUT TOGETHER BOMBS WALKED INTO TWO PUPS AND THEN CLAIM IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
I'VE NEVER HEARD SUCH A LOAD OF UTTER RUBBISH
BE ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE AND MAKE SUCH CLAIMS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT IT WAS A PRUDE HE DOESN'T CONSIDER THEM TO BE MURDEROUS WELL I WONDER IF ONE OF HIS OWN KIDS WAS KILLED BEYOND DESCRIPTION WITH ALL THIS SKIN HAS LITERALLY BEEN STRIPPED OFF THEIR BODY THEY'VE GOT NO LEGS THEY'VE GOT NO ARMS YOU CAN'T RECOGNISE THEM BY THEIR FACE BECAUSE THEIR INJURIES ARE SUCH THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN PARTIALLY CREMATED
MAKE SUCH HURT POWERING AN HORRENDOUS STATEMENTS OVER OVER THE AIRWAVES CLAIMING THEY WERE
FOR WANT OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION SOLDIERS IF THEY WERE SOLDIERS THEY WOULD HAVE PRINCIPLES AND DISCIPLINE WHERE WAS THEIR DISCIPLINE THEY'D EVEN I DO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE WHICH SHOWED BUT THEY KNEW THAT THEY'D DONE WRONG AND IF THEY WERE DECENT
THERE WERE TO PUT THEIR HANDS UP AND SAY YES I DID THIS AND I DID IT FOR THIS REASON BUT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT AND THEY AND THEY JUST SHOWS HOW LES THEY ARE BECAUSE IF THEY
HE KIND OF MORAL OR HUMANITY THEY WOULD ACTUALLY DO EXACTLY WHAT KIERAN CAN'T AS YOU SAID AND WALKING TO THE LOCAL POLICE STATION AND PUT THEIR HANDS UP IN THE
YES I DID THIS AND I'M PROUD I DO THIS AND I'M COMING IN TO ADMIT WHAT I'VE DONE AND THESE OTHER CLAIM THERE'S NO EVIDENCE HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT NOBODY KNOWS
ONLY THE SECRET SERVICE WOULD KNOW THAT M.I.FIVE AND M.I.SIX AND SO WOULD I. WEST MIDLANDS PLACE MISTER CONWAY A FINAL WORD FROM YOU ADDRESS PERHAPS TO JULIE HAMBLETON ON THE POINT THAT HE HAS JUST MADE
WELL LOOK I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO AGREE WITH ME I THINK THE BUNNIES WERE APPALLING THERE WERE APPALLING AND EVERY LEVEL THEY WERE A MORAL
BUT OF ALL THE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THE FACT IS AND IT WAS ACCEPTED BY THE CHRIS MODEL ANOTHER OF STARTS AND THE RECORD SHOWS STARTER THERE WASN'T TIME TO RING IN MORNINGS BUT ALL HIS CAME TO LACE KIERAN CONWAY AND JULIE HAMBLEDON THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THE TIME TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE T.V.

STRONG WOMEN THAT'S WHAT SHE BROUGHT TO THE SCREEN WASN'T IT STRONG WOMEN CHARACTERS LIKE YOURS
AND IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF OUR BACKGROUND AND HER EDUCATION WHICH IS SADLY LACKING AT MY OWN REALLY I WAS BROUGHT UP DURING THE WAR I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EDUCATION AT ALL PERHAPS IN THE SHELTER DOWN IN A FIELD AND HER EDUCATION WAS IN MID HELD AT THAT ME BUT TWENTY EIGHT SHE WAS BORN BY THE VERY VERY ISH OR SIMILAR
AND SHE WASN'T INTERESTED IN THEIR EDUCATION AS SUCH AND HER EARLY LIFE AND WENT TO A ROMAN CATHOLIC SCHOOL WAS TREATED APPALLINGLY AND RIGID SHE REJECTED THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WROTE A POEM MUST SURELY SURE WAS A WONDERFUL POEM SHE WROTE
AND WON A PRIZE FOR IT WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN AND I WAS THE BEGINNING THAT WAS A BEGINNING BECAUSE SHE WASN'T HAPPY IN SCHOOL AT ALL A VERY STRICT RELIGION ROMAN CATHOLIC UPBRINGING AGE WASN'T ROMAN CATHOLIC AND THEY SAID SO AND SAID THEY'D CUT OFF OUR HANDS ONE HORRIBLE NONE BECAUSE SHE WENT AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE VIRGIN MARY OR SOMETHING WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THAT SHE BOTTLED ALL OF THAT
AND USED IT WHEN IT CAME TO WRITING THESE CHARACTERS BECAUSE SHE WAS INDEPENDENT SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY FREE AND AS SHE HAD KIDS SHE MARRIED AT SEVENTEEN HAD TWO CHILDREN BADGERS NINETEEN HAD A VERY
IT'S VERY POOR BACKGROUND UP HE WOULD SAY VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS WHERE SHE LEFT HER MOTHER WAS VERY STRICT NEARLY DROWNED SHE DID HE CUT A BOOK SO WONDERFUL ASSEMBLY I'LL FIND ME AND I BREAK EVERYONE TO READ I DIDN'T KNOW SHE READ A BOOK THAT AS WELL JUST AS WELL AS THE TOUGHNESS
THAT CAME FROM THAT BACKGROUND SHE HAD THIS AMAZING ABILITY WITH COMPETENCY WHICH SHE COULD SEE SHE'D SHE YEAH WHY WAS ABUSED YOU COULD SAY BUT SHE WENT OVER HER HEAD AND WHAT SHE DID SHE CREATED MARVELLOUS WOMEN WHO ARE VERY STRONG WOMEN
LIKE MA BOSWELL WHICH I PLAYED AND WHO WAS A GREAT DISCIPLINARIAN AND WAS BREAKING ALL THE RULES OF THE KIDS SO THAT SHE BROUGHT I BROUGHT IN THE SERIES WERE WOMEN DOING EVERYTHING THAT WAS WOOD SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO DO AND THEY WEAR THIS SORT OF THING THEY'RE NOT PAYING ANY TAX IS DOING EVERYTHING OFF AFTER THE CALF AND SHE LOVED THAT AND THE SERIES BEFORE THAT I WOKE UP ONE MORNING ABOUT FOUR UPPER HARLOT
IN A DRYING OUT CLINIC IN FACT I GOT THE PART OF NELLIE THANKS TO MICHAEL ANGELUS AND I WAS IN BOYS FROM THE BLACK STUFF WITH HIM AND WE WERE DOING I WORK AT ONE MORNING WHICH WAS ABOUT FOUR ARC AHOLICS IN A DRYING OUT KELLY I WAS PLAYING A GHASTLY CREATURE CALLED MISSUS HAMILTON SCREAMING AND HER HUSBAND WERE NEVER GOT OUT OF BAD SUE NEVER SAW HIM
AND THAT WAS A REALLY STRONG GHASTLY CREATURE
I LOVED IT I LOVED PLAYING AND SHE WROTE POETIC SPEECHES FOR SHE WE WERE LISTENING TO HER WON'T WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF GETTING BUTTERFLIES ONTO THE SCREEN INITIALLY INITIAL RELUCTANCE OF THE B. B. C. WHAT WAS HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE WHO COMMISSIONED WORK ALWAYS DIFFICULT AND THEN WHAT I WOULD THINK SO WE KEPT OUT OF IT BUT I DID KNOW THAT ONE SERIES PERHAPS I SHOULD MENTION MY NAME
DON'T SUPPOSE IS THERE ANY MORE HOWEVER IT WAS A SERIES AND THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW HER IMAGE THIS IS THE TIME WE WERE DOING BRETT THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW HER INTO REHEARSAL
YOU SEE BECAUSE HE WAS HEAD OF COMEDY AT THIS BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS WROTE AN EPISODE AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF REHEARSAL
YOU WENT IN WE READ IT FOR HER AND THEN SHE DECIDED WHAT WAS MISSING OR WHAT CHARACTER WASN'T DEVELOPED AND SO SHE ALWAYS GAVE YOU A SPEECH BY ABOUT TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP HER OUT COS SHE WAS TOO DIFFICULT YES I WOULD YES BECAUSE SHE WAS TO TRY AND CHANGE THINGS IF SHE DIDN'T LIKE SOMEBODY WELL THEY REALLY GOT IT AND THEY WERE SO UNKIND TO HER
SHE ACTUALLY REFUSED TO CONTINUE WRITING THAT SUE IT IS AND I WON'T MENTION IT NO ALL RIGHT I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO THOSE WHO NEED TO KNOW WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT QUICK ENOUGH DO AND NELLIE BOSWELL IN BREAD REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND AN ENORMOUS ABILITY OF CARLA LANE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S UP WITH THE SPORT GOOD MORNING JOHN THAT WE NOW KNOW THE MAKE UP OF THE HOME NATION SQUADS FOR EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN HEADLINES FROM ENGLAND OTHER EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD MARCUS FOR ASHFORD AND LIVEABLE STRIKER DANIEL STURRIDGE ERIN BUT ANDLES TOWNSEND AND DANNY DRINKWATER ARRRR OUT FOR A WELL STRIKER JOHN HARTSON SAYS THE INCLUSION OF JOE LEDLEY IN THE WALES SQUAD IS THE RIGHT CHOICE
DESPITE THE CRYSTAL PALACE MIDFIELDER BREAKING HIS LEG LESS THAN A MONTH AGO AND WILL GREG MADE THE NORTHERN IRELAND SQUAD AFTER SCORING TWENTY FIVE GOALS AS WIGAN WON THE LEAGUE ONE TITLE TWENTY SIXTEEN IS AN OLYMPIC YEAR OF COURSE WHICH MEANS MORE ATTENTION ON WOMEN'S SPORT THAN USUAL AT LONDON TWENTY TWELVE WOMEN MADE UP MORE THAN FORTY FOUR PER CENT OF PARTICIPANTS BUT DOES THAT TRANSFER OVER TO REAL LIFE WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN SPORT IS SLOWLY INCREASING BUT BARRY STILL EXIST
SPORTS WRITER AND CO FOUNDER AND CHAIR OF WOMEN IN FOOTBALL ALNWICK CASTLE HAS JUST WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT HOW WOMEN PLAYING SPORT CAN CHANGE ALL OUR LIVES AND SHE'S IN THE STUDIO WITH US GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME ANNA THANK YOU NOW IN THE BOOK DO YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT WOMEN WHO PLAY SPORT ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED IN OTHER AREAS OF THEIR LIFE MORE LIKELY TO REACH THE TOP OF THE CAREER LADDER AND YOU'VE GIVEN EXAMPLES OF HILLARY CLINTON I.M.F. BOSS CHRISTINE LAGAAN AND TWITTER BOARD MEMBER MARJORIE SCARDINO WHO AMUSINGLY WAS AN EX RODEO RIGHT
WHY IS THAT WHY DO THEY SUCCEED MORE IT'S A STUDY THAT CAME OUT BY AN E. Y. AND THEY LOOKED AT THEIR HEIGHT REALLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN AT THE SEA SWEET HE HAD THIS SERIOUS SPORTS BACKGROUND AND I THINK WHAT'S SO ILLUMINATING ABOUT THIS I'VE TRIED TO GET ACROSS IN THE BOOK IS THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS NARRATIVE ABOUT WOMEN IN SPORT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT COMBATING AND BE SETTEE CRISIS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TRYING TO GET FIT AND GET A BIKINI BODY GOD FORBID
THEY ARE ACTUALLY REAL QUALITIES WITHIN SPORT THAT THAT CAN CHANGE WOMEN'S LIVES ONE OF THEM IS TO DO WITH THE PLACE BUT EM SPORT IS THIS VERY VERY POWERFUL LANGUAGE THAT AS A USED ACROSS THE BUSINESS INDUSTRY POLITICS THE UNITED NATIONS HAVE SAID THAT SPORT CAN CHANGE THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND GIRLS SO THIS IS THAT THIS IS A REAL KEY ISSUE BUT ONE OF THE BARRIERS
AND I FOUND THIS QUITE STRIKING WAS HOW SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH NOT JUST RESEARCH RELATING TO SPORT DIRECTLY IS USUALLY CARRIED OUT ON MEN SOME MEN AT THE DE FELT AND THEN WOMEN GET THEIR ADVICE BASED ON
BUT SUCH DONNA MEN YES SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT I CAME ACROSS WAS VERY SHOCKING WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS LOOKING INTO THIS FOR THE BOOK AND THINGS LIKE WOMEN HAVE VERY DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS WHEN THEY'RE HAVING A HEART ATTACK AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN SENT HOME FROM HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY DON'T PRESENT WITH THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS MEN THEY'RE THE F.D.A. IN THE U.S. HAVE JUST DECIDED AND TWENTY THIRTEEN THAT WHEN SHOULD TAKE HALF THE DOSE OF SLEEPING PILLS THAN MEN
AND OF COURSE THIS TRUCK TRANSLATES INTO ELITE SPORT ANY PARTICIPATION OF SPORT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE HOW TO ADD AS MENSTRUATION AFFECT WOMEN WHO ARE EXERCISING THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE DON'T YET KNOW AND THAT WOULD BE USEFUL
YOU MENTION SERENA WILLIAMS QUITE A LOT AND THIS WEEK SHE CONTINUES HER CAMPAIGN TO EQUAL STEFFI GRAF RECORD OF TWENTY TWO GRAND SLAM TITLES AND YOU MAKE THE POINT BUT EVEN WHEN WOMEN ACHIEVE SOMEONE LIKE HER FOR EXAMPLE SHE ISN'T GIVEN ENOUGH CREDIT FOR HER ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE AND ACTUALLY THERE ARE COMPARISONS TO MUHAMMAD ALI IS SHE THE NEXT MUHAMMAD ALI I THINK WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HER THIS WAY AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT THE TREND AROUND SERENA WILLIAMS AS THAT
THESE TERRIBLE THINGS SAID ABOUT HOW PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SHE'S OVERLY MUSCULAR THEY CALL HER MASCULINE AND SHE'S HAD A LOT OF RACIST ABUSE AND RACIAL SLURS AND REALLY WE SHOULD CELEBRATE WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING HIS INCREDIBLE ATTLEE AS ONE OF THE GODS OF OUR TIME AND DAVE'S IRENE U.S. SPORTS WRITER TALKED ABOUT THIS COMPARISON WITH MOHAMMED ALI AND WHEN I FIRST CAME ACROSS I WAS QUITE SHOCKED BUT THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT
YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS SHE SOMEBODY WHO QUOTES MAYA ANGELOU SHE FIGHTS RACISM SHE TALKS ABOUT MENSTRUATION SHE'S A REAL HERO AND SHE'S ALSO OF COURSE AN INCREDIBLE ATHLETE BEFORE YOU GO WHAT A FEW MADE A FORMER OLYMPIC CHAMPION CHRIS BOARDMAN'S COMMENTS THIS WEEK THAT SHANE SUTTON WAS FORCED OUT OF HIS ROLE AS BRITISH CYCLING'S TECHNICAL DIRECTOR BY A LYNCH MOB
YES I MEAN OF COURSE I'M NOT INSIDE BRITISH CYCLING SO I DON'T KNOW THE INS AND OUTS OF WHAT I'VE GONE ON I THINK IT'S A VERY AGGRESSIVE PHRASE TO BE USING ALEX CERTAINLY FOR ME OR SOMEBODY WORKING IN SPORT IT'S UNSURPRISING THAT THESE KIND OF STORIES HAVE COME UP IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO BRITISH CYCLING AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THESE KIND OF THINGS LIKE THAT I'VE HAD A FEMALE RIDER BEFORE TELL ME HOW SHE WAS
BULLIED BY HER COACH AND TOLD THAT SHE SHOULDN'T GET PREGNANT AND SO ON SO IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY JUST ABOUT SHANE SATURN BUT I THINK HE'S THIS KIND OF DEFENCE AROUND HIM IN HIS SURPRISE AT BEING TARGETED IN THIS WAY I THINK SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF SPORT AND PERHAPS HE DOESN'T EVEN REALISE HOW UNACCEPTABLE THOSE THOSE SEXIST AND DISABLE HIS COMMENTS WERE
I GUESS I'M AFRAID WE'RE OUT OF TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN AND ANNA'S BOOK IT'S WET PLAY IS OUT IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS TODAY'S RACING SELECTIONS FROM TWELVE TO FOURTEEN NUMBER THREE ROCKIN ROBIN AND CAN'T MEL THREE TWENTY NUMBER TWO THE FLYING PORTRAIT SO THANK YOU MIDWEEK FOLLOWS US AT NINE LIBBY PURVES ALREADY HERE WITH THE JAILS MORNING LIBBY GOOD MORNING TO FAMILY STORIES TODAY ONE ADMIRING AND FARMED AS BARBARA ISRAEL PAYS TRIBUTE IN A SHOW ABOUT HIS FATHER THE NEW YORK COUNTERCULTURE POET STEVE BEN ISRAEL

JULIE HAMILTON WHO SISTER MAXINE DIED IN THE ATTACKS TOLD US THERE'S A QUESTION MARK OVER THE DEATHS AT THE FAMILIES WANT TRUTH JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY
EXIT CAMPAIGNERS SAY THAT FREE MOVEMENT IN THE E.U. LOWERS WAGES AND IT'S CALLING FOR A POINTS BASED SYSTEM SIMILAR TO AUSTRALIA FOR ALL MIGRANTS BUT THE T.U.C. WHICH SUPPORTS THE CAMPAIGN TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. SAYS HER BRICKS IT WOULD CAUSE WAGES TO FALL
THERE'S NEW EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE ARE WAITING TOO LONG TO BE DIAGNOSED AND TREATED FOR MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE A SURVEY OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND WHO HAVE THE ILLNESS SUGGESTS A FIFTH HAD TO WAIT MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE REFERRAL TO A SPECIALIST
THE WORLD'S LONGEST AND DEEPEST RAIL TUNNEL WILL BE OFFICIALLY OPENED IN SWITZERLAND TODAY THE GOT HARD TUNNEL IS MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE MILES LONG AND IT'S TAKEN NEARLY TWENTY YEARS TO BUILD IT WILL PROVIDE A HIGH SPEED LINK FOR TRAINS GOING FROM THE NETHERLANDS TO ITALY
THANK YOU JUST COMING UP TO TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO NINE A BIG PROMISE TODAY FROM THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AN E.U. REFERENDUM TO BAKE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A GENERATION THEY SAY IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR POLITICIANS TO KEEP THEIR PROMISES ON IMMIGRATION OUTSIDE THE E.U. WE COULD HAVE A POINTS BASED SYSTEM WHERE WE CONTROL
AND POTENTIALLY REDUCED IMMIGRATION AND ALLOWED HIM THE PEOPLE WE WANTED IN THE LABOUR M.P. GIVES A STUART CO CHAIRS THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AND IS ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TENNIS IS A UKIP POLICY THAT YOU AND EAT THE CONSERVATIVES IN BOAT LEAVE AS WELL ALL CAMPAIGNED AGAINST AT THE LAST ELECTION
BUT THIS IS A REFERENDUM ABOUT HOW THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY AND HOW WE ARE GOVERNED AND ESSENTIALLY WERE HIGHLIGHTING AN AREA OF POLICY ON CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION WHICH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS NO LONGER CONTROL OVER THAT GIVEN
THAT PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET MEANS THAT MASSIVE AUTOMATIC FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR
THE PRIME MINISTER WHO ORIGINALLY IN HE STILL HAD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD GET SOME CONTROLS ON THAT SO THAT PEOPLE COULD ONLY COME IF THEIR JOB HE FAILED IN DOING THAT
WE'VE SEEN THAT EVEN THIS PROMISE OF REDUCING IT HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO KEEP SO THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO NOW AND HOW THE FUTURE WOULD LOOK COULD YOU KNEW ALL OF THAT BEFORE THE LAST ELECTION BUT YOU WERE CAMPAIGNING FOR THESE THINGS YOU'VE COME ON A JOURNEY PUT IT MARKLIN NO BECAUSE IF IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE THAN THE U.K. GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE CONTROL OF A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS IF WE VOTE TO REMAIN
THEN WE WILL FOREVER HAVE LOST THAT ABILITY AND IS THAT PARTICULAR CHOICE WHICH FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME HAVE MEANT THAT YOU KNOW YOU MAKE A DECISION I THINK IT'S BEST FOR THE COUNTRY OTHER THINK UKIP WANT TO DO OF COURSE IS REDUCE THE NUMBERS NOW ARE YOU
CAMPAIGNING AS WELL THEN THAT THIS POLICY THIS POINTS BASED SYSTEM WOULD LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE NET MIGRATION OF PEOPLE FROM
WHAT I'M CAMPAIGNING FOR HIS INABILITY TO MANAGE THEIR MIGRATION TO A LEVEL THAT A IT'S APPROPRIATE TO THAT THE JOBS WE NEED TO THE MEAT OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY RICE SOPHIE DECIDED JUST TO BE CLEAR IF WE DECIDED THAT THE NUMBERS AT THE MOMENT WERE APPROPRIATE THEY SORT OF THE O.B. ARE SAYS THAT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO RAISE TAXES CUT SPENDING AND ET-CETERA ET-CETERA YOU KNOW ALL THE ECONOMICS OF IT IF WE DECIDED
THIS NUMBER WAS APPROPRIATE THEN WE COULD STICK WITH IT OTHERWISE YOU ARE NOT PROMISING PEOPLE THAT THE NUMBERS WOULD COME DOWN UNDER THIS SYSTEM BUT THE KEY WORD JUSTIN YOU'VE JUST USE IF WE DECIDED AND IF WE DID DECIDE THEN IT WOULD BE A REFLECTION OF THE ECONOMY WE WOULD THEN MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC SERVICES SUCH AS THE SCHOOLS PLACES AT HOSPITALS
WOULD BE APPROPRIATELY GEARED UP TO MEET THEM HE NEEDS BUT WHAT THEY'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT IS PUSHING NUMBER EIGHTIES HUGE PRESSURE ON SCHOOL PLACES AND PUBLIC SERVICES CARBON BUT NOW YOU BUT NOW YOU SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING THAT WE DO NEED FUEL
BUT THE KEY THING OF THIS REFERENDUM AND THE KEY CHOICE IS WHERE IS THE BASIS OF THEIR CONSENT ON WHICH WE MAKE THOSE DECISIONS CURRENTLY
HOW DID IMMIGRATION POLICY OF OF THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T HAVE TO CONSENT AND THAT OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE BECAUSE
HUGE CHUNKS OF IT OR NOT DECIDED INVESTMENTS I TAKE YOUR POINT TAKEN IT CAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT THAT WE WOULD BE DECIDING BUT THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF THING WOULD BE DECIDING AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS ON THE ONE HAND WE MIGHT REDUCE NUMBERS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THOUGH WE MIGHT NOT SO THERE'S THERE'S NO CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN UNDER THIS SYSTEM
BECAUSE THE NUMBERS WOULD DEPEND ON THE NEEDS OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY IF FOR EXAMPLE WE NEED IT MORE DOCTORS AND MORE STUFF FOR THE N.H.S. THEN FOOT WILL BE WE WILL BE ABLE TO INSIST THAT THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLS ARE THERE BUT WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT THE PROPER NUMBER
AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF IT THIS BIT OH DON'T WHAT ABOUT THE SPEED OF ALL OF THIS BECAUSE CHRIS GRAYLING WAS PEERING ON NEWSNIGHT LAST NIGHT NOR PARENT TO SUGGEST ACTUALLY THAT WE COULD QUITE QUICKLY BEGIN TO WELL AS HE PUT IN THE PROCESS OF LIMITING THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE TO MAKE NEW DECISIONS ABOUT THE U.K. AS WE NEGOTIATE OUR EXIT IS SURELY SENSIBLE DO YOU HAVE DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM
BUT ONCE YOU START THE PROCESS SOME OF THINGS HE COULD INTRODUCE FAIRLY SWIFTLY AMENDMENTS TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY'S ACT AND ALL THOSE THINGS BUT BUT THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE PROCESS OF WHAT THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE WHICH HAVE TO BE TAKEN FIRST BUT DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM THAT WE COULD START TO DO THAT QUITE QUICKLY SO QUITE SOON AFTER AN EXIT VOTE WE COULD SAY TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE ACTUALLY WE NO LONGER TAKE NOTE OF THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE
THE KEY THING IS THAT UNLESS WE TAKE CONTROL ON THE TWENTY THIRD WHICH IS THE ONE THING WHICH I'M FOCUSING ON I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET A VOTE LEAF ON THE TWENTIETH THAT BECAUSE IF WE DON'T BUT NONE OF THESE DECISIONS
BUT EVEN BE ABLE TO BE DISCUSSED BY THE BRITISH PUBLIC BECAUSE WE LOST THE POWER TO TAKE CONTROL OVER THOSE AREAS OF POLICY DIESEL OR STEWART WHO CASE CO CHAIR OF THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT LIFE MUST BE LIKE IN THE IRAQI CITY OF FALLUJAH FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS THE CITY HAS BEEN HELD BY THE MURDEROUS FORCES OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE FOR THE PAST EIGHT DAYS THE CITY'S BEEN UNDER SIEGE BY IRAQI FORCES SUPPORTED BY AMERICAN AIRPOWER TRYING TO DRIVE THEM OUT
WELL COLONEL CHRIS GARBER IS THE CHIEF OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS FOR THE COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE WHICH IS RANGED AGAINST IESUS COLONEL GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING TO YOU WHAT SORT OF PROGRESS DO YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE MAKING BECAUSE FROM THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKS AN UTTER DISASTER FOR LOOT
WELL CLEARLY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE COOL FALLUJAH AS ARE THE IRAQIS THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT BUT WE ARE MAKING
A GROUSE TOWARDS THE CITY ITSELF AND LIKE WE SAW IN REMARKABLY LIKE WE SAW WE SAW IN BEIJING THE BEST WAY TO HELP
THE PEOPLE IS TO GET RID OF THE ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS THERE ARE HOLDING THE CITY SO CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MULTIPLE BRIGADES OF IRAQI SECURITY FORCES AND STRUGGLING TO SITTING IN A CROUCHING
SOME DEFINE WHAT WE CALL DIFFERENT AXES DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT IT'S BEEN A TOUGH FIGHT OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS THE ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS HAD PUT UP A TOUGH FIGHT FOR OF THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE
SOME STRONG FIGHTING TO GET THROUGH AND INTO THE CITY PROPER THE PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE IS THAT MANY OF THOSE FORCES WHO ARE FIGHTING A SHEER MOST OF THEM AND MANY MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY A SUNNY SO IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL SIDE THEY ARE INDEED SIDING WITH I AM
LATER SOMETHING CERTAINLY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE OF MOSEL WHICH IS THE NEXT CITY THIS TO LIBERATE FROM EARLY ISLAMIC STATE THEY'RE WATCHING CAREFULLY TO HER BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SUNNI TRIBAL FIGHTERS
OR HAIR AND RIGHT NEXT TO THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES AS THEY ARE AS THEY'RE FIGHTING SO WE HAVE SONY FORCES RIGHT ALONGSIDE IN CO OPERATING WITH
THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES AS WELL BUT THEY WERE GOING TO WATCH THAT CAREFULLY WE'RE GOING TO WATCH FOR SECTARIANISM BUT WE WE THINK THEY'RE FOCUSED ON DEFEATING I SAW DEFEATING THE ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FOCUSING ON OUR SHOW AND AS YOU WILL KNOW THERE ARE MANY WHO SAY MANY INFORMED OBSERVERS WHO SAY THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO DEFEAT THEM WITH AIR STRIKES AND WITH LOCAL INDIGENOUS ARMED FORCES THE TIME HAS COME WHERE THERE MUST BE OUTSIDE ARMIES ON THE GROUND FOREIGN BOOTS ON THE GROUND FOR COMBAT PURSES PURPOSES MIGHT THEY BE AMERICAN BOOTS IF THAT HAPPENS
WELL WE HAVE SEEN PROGRESS AND SUCCESS IN THE TRAINING OF THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES SO I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD AGREE WITH THOSE EXPERTS THERE A CAVEAT IN THAT WAY WE WE'VE SEEN THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES AS TRUE YOU CALL ASIAN TRAINING AND EQUIPPING GET BETTER WE'VE SEEN THEM PERFORM IN
DIFFERENT COME BETTER TO AGENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY WE'VE SEEN THEM PERFORM BETTER AND WE THINK THAT THE POWERFUL LOU IT'S INEVITABLE THAT
THAT THE ISLAMIC STATE WELFARE TO THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE OUT CERTAINLY I AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT THERE OUR CAT WIN A LOT WHICH IS WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING THEM ON THE GROUND WE'VE GOT ADVISORS CALLED WISHING ADVISERS OUTWITH THE IRAQI FORCES PROVIDING ASSISTANCE PROVIDING ADVICE PROVIDING PLANNING HELP AS WELL AND IN THE MEANTIME A AWFUL LOT OF TOTALLY INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE AUNTS ARE INDEED DYING AS WE SPEAK ON
WE'VE SEEN SOME HUNDREDS OF CIVILIANS BEING ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM FOR LOU'S ALREADY AND MANY GRILLED
AND CERTAINLY WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY OF THE CIVILIANS THERE ARE INSIGHTFUL OSIER WERE WEREN'T WE TAKE COLLATERAL DAMAGE AND VERY SERIOUSLY WERE BEING VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE APPLY OUR AIR POWER APPLIED A STRAIGHT TO SUPPORT THE IRAQIS AND WE'RE GONNA WATCH CAREFULLY AS WELL AT THE UNITED NATIONS OBSERVERS ON THE OUTSIDE READY TO MOVE INTO THE CITY AS WELL
MANY PACKS THEY TIME FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THESE ARE WORRYING TIMES OF BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE MOVED TO ANOTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THEIR LIVES WILL CHANGE OF BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION OR INDEED IF THEIR LIVES WOULD CHANGE MANY OF THEM OF COURSE MOVED TO SPAIN AND CONWAY THIS MONEY'S IN MY BAIL ON THE COSTA DEL SOL A LOW AGAIN
I'M AT THE BLUE PALM CAFE WE'RE LOOKING OUT AT THE MEDITERRANEAN IT'S A VERY UNASHAMED MADELY BRITISH CAFE THERE ARE CERTAINLY NO PAELLA ON THE MENU HERE THERE ISN'T ALL DAY ENGLISH BREAKFAST OF COURSE AND I'M HERE WITH THE BRITISH REEF STEVENSON SHE'S BEEN RUNNING HIS CAFE FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS AND WITH KEITH WHITE HE'S BEEN RENTING AN APARTMENT ROUND THE CORNER HERE FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS
RUTH CAN I ASK YOU YOU'VE ALREADY VOTED HAVEN'T YOU VOTED TO STAY IN FOR A POSTAL VOTE ADMITTED A POSTAL THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT REGISTERED ONLINE AND GOT THE PAPERWORK HERE AND WE'VE ALREADY VOTED
CAN I JUST ASK YOU WHAT IT WAS LIKE MEETING HERE BECAUSE YOU MOVED HERE FROM BRITAIN ABOUT A DECADE AGO NINE YEARS AGO WE MOVED UP WE DECIDED TO CHANGE OUR LIFE WE BROUGHT THE BLUE PALM AND WE MOVED FROM LONDON TO SPAIN IT WAS ALL VERY EASY COS YOU'RE A PARTY
WHAT ABOUT THAT ARGUMENT CASE THAT IF BRITAIN LEAVES YOU WANT BRITAIN TO COME OUT IF BRITAIN LEAVES WILL BE MUCH HARDER FOR BRITISH HARDWORKING BRITISH PEOPLE LIKE RUTH TO COME HERE TO SPAIN TO WORK AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY
I THINK THAT'S A BIT OF AN UNKNOWN AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME I MEAN PERSONALLY I'D VOTED OUT BUILDING SIMPLY BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE
GREAT BRITAIN TO HAVE ITS OWN SOVEREIGNTY AND ALSO TO BE IN CONTROL OF HIS DESTINY
WHAT ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE THE
EASE WITH WHICH RUTH AND HER HUSBAND NIGEL COULD COME HERE AND SET UP A BUSINESS IS IT REALLY WORTH PUTTING THAT KIND
ENTREPRENEURSHIP IF YOU LIKE AT RISK OF COURSE NOT I'M AND I WOULD SYMPATHISE WITH RUTH AND I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE THAT I WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE VOTED TO STAY IN
DAVID CAMERON BEEN ABLE TO NEGOTIATE CERTAIN POLICY
BUT IT'S IT'S THE UNKNOWN I DON'T THINK RUTH MY NOSE ANY MORE THAN I DO BUT I THINK
AS A BRITISH PERSON I'M A BUSINESS MAN I FIND THAT
WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF OUT OF YOU ALTHOUGH I STILL THINK
THAT WE SHOULD BE PART OF IT I KNOW IT'S A SORT OF CONTRADICTORY BUT THERE'S TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY ROUTE ISN'T THERE AN ARGUMENT IN A SENSE YOUR VOTE IS QUITE SELFISH YOU'VE DONE INCREDIBLY WELL OUT HERE BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN BRITAIN WHO ARE
FEELING VERY THREATENED BY E.U. MIGRATION THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR JOBS FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING TRADE
AS I SAID TO YOU EARLIER ZOE IS A VERY SELFISH BOAT BOATS AND I'D LIVE IN MY OWN LOVELY WORLD MY BAY A BUBBLE OVER HERE IT WAS EASY TO MOVE HERE IT WASN'T EASY TO SET THE BUSINESS UP THIS HE'S TAKEN A LOT OF HARD WORK BUT I WORRY THAT
IF WE COME OUT OF THE YEAR YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT IF I LIVED IN ENGLAND STILL I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY VOTE WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLY
THIS IS A VERY SELFISH VOTE FOR MY HUSBAND AND I BUT WE HAD TO FELT WE HAD TO VOTE
WOULDN'T IT ACTUALLY END UP DAMAGING THE SPANISH ECONOMY IF PEOPLE LIKE RUTH OR NIGEL COULDN'T COME HERE
OF COURSE IT WOULD BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL EVER COME TO THAT I DON'T I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH
POLITICS SCARE MONGERING AND I THINK THERE'S NOT BEEN ENOUGH INFORMATION
AS TO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHETHER WE'RE IN OR WEAR OUT AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHY EVERYBODY'S HAVING THIS DEBATE BUT I THINK WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT IT'S MADE PEOPLE THINK I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S SO INTERESTING ALREADY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
RUTH KEITH THANKS VERY MUCH WELL UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE BEEN DRAGGED BACK TO LONDON BUT NOT BEFORE WE'VE HAD A FULL ENGLISH BREAKFAST
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME TEN TO NINE WHAT DID LONDON INDEED OTHER BIG CITIES SOUND LIKE IN YEARS GONE BY THE SOUND ARCHIVE EST IAN ROARS HAS BEEN COLLECTING UP THE SOUNDS OF LONDON GOING BACK DECADES AND DAYS GOING TO MAKING A PRESENTATION OF THEM IN LONDON'S LOST WORLDS OF SOUNDS AND WE COME HERE AND HE'S GOING TO GIVE US A PREVIEW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH THIS SOUND THAT WAS BANNED BY THE METROPOLITAN POLICE IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES
WHO'S SINGING AND WHY AND THAT'S MY ROBERT PENFOLD OF BATTERSEA AND THAT WAS RECORDED IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT HE WAS A LAVENDER SELLER HE WOULD HAVE ROAMED THE LONDON STREET SELLING LAVENDER WHICH IS PRINCIPALLY USE THEN TOWARD CLOTHES MOTHS AWAY I WAS ABOUT
IT'S A SONG RATHER THAN A STREET CRY AND THIS OBSCURE VICTORIAN LAW CALLED THE METROPOLITAN STREET MUSIC ACT WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY BROUGHT IN TO COPE THE ACTIVITIES OF ITALIAN ORGAN GRINDERS WHO WERE GETTING ALL THE GREAT AND THE GOOD OF THE DAY WERE THE BAND STILL THERE YOU PROBABLY STILL CAN'T REALLY IT'S BEEN USED HAPHAZARDLY EVEN THE SALVATION ARMY HAVE FALLEN FOUL OF THE METROPOLITAN STREET NINA'S HERE ANOTHER ONE CANE CHAIRS TO MEND YEAH GOOD HELLO HI
THE MAN HI THERE MAN IT'S LOVELY TO HAVE A KIND OF SOUNDS IN THE BACKGROUND AS WELL AS NET THERE THAT'S DATING BACK FROM WHERE THAT'S FROM NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE AND THAT WAS RECORDED NOT FAR FROM HERE IN WIMPOLE STREET
AND WE PLAY ONE EARLIER ARMOUR LES LET'S HEAR IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S A SONG THAT EVERYONE KNOWS AND THIS IS REALLY GAME OUT THIS IS PRE PRE WAR ACTUALLY ISN'T IT THE MUFFIN
RECORDED WHERE THAT WAS RECORDED ON THE ISLE OF DOGS IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT
AND SAID NOT A BAD RECORDING A MINUTE NINE SCRATCHES YOU'D EXPECT THAT WITH A GOOD VOICE IT'S THE SORT OF TIMBRE OF THE VOICE IS QUITE CLEAR IT IS THE KIDS SPEAK VERY CLEARLY AND VERY PROPERLY WHEN THEY INTERVIEWED BY ONE PRESENTED I THINK MAY HAVE BEEN AUDREY RUSSELL SHE'S NOT NAMED IN THE PROGRAMME NOTE WHY DO YOU DO IT SO WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU AND WE GET
FROM MAINTAINING THESE SOUNDS I THINK WE GET SOMETHING WHICH WE CAN'T GET FROM PHOTOGRAPHS AND WE OFTEN CAN'T GET FROM OLD NEWSREELS IN WHICH THERE IS TYPICALLY A COMMENTATOR'S VOICE PREDOMINANT OR SOME KIND OF MOOD MUSIC WHEN WE HEAR SOUNDS ALONE IT'S THE BEST STIMULANT TO THE IMAGINATION AND I'M HEARING THEM MYSELF I NEVER TIRE OF LISTENING TO THEM THEY IMMEDIATELY PULL ME BACKWARDS IN TIME THERE'S HER PETTICOAT MARKET THIS IS THE LATE NINETEEN THIRTIES
TAKE YOUR MONEY OUT OF A LITTLE BIT WE HAVE A MUCH
I WAS BEING HERE WHEN I'M DEAD AND FORGOTTEN AS I SHALL BE AND SWEEPING DOWN
MENTION OF ME MUST BE HEARD SAY I LIKE YOU
EXTERNALLY ROOFING MIKE STONE WAS A REAL CHARACTER HE HE USED TO WEAR AN ADMIRAL'S HAT AND ROBE TRIMMED WITH ERMINE AND HE AND HE'D STYLED HIMSELF AS THE MAYOR OF PETTICOAT LANE HE WAS VERY MUCH THE LEADER OF THE MARKET TRADERS THERE AND IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES BECAUSE IT WAS A SUNDAY MARKET THEY WERE A WAR WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHO WOULD TRY AND DISRUPT THEIR TRADING
BY SENDING FIRE ENGINES UP AND DOWN PETTICOAT LANE RINGING THEIR BELLS AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE TO DROWN OUT THEIR VOICES OF THE MARKET TRADERS MIKE STERN STUCK UP FOR HIS COMMUNITY OF TRADERS AND LEAD A MARCH ON PARLIAMENT IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND LOCAL BY LAWS WERE AMENDED WONDERFUL TO HEAR ALL OF THEM SOUND I US THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
SIX MINUTES TO NINE REMEMBER ECSTASY BACK IN THE NINETIES IT SEEMED EVERY OTHER YOUNGSTER AT EVERY OTHER RAVE WAS USING IT THE DRUG OF CHOICE THAT MEANT YOU COULD DANCE ALL NIGHT AND MAYBE SUP AND THAT LITTLE EFFECTS HAVE SEX SOMETIMES PEOPLE DIED FROM USING IT WILL NOW ACCORDING TO THE EUROPEAN DRUG USE A REPORT IT'S MAKING A COMEBACK SHOULD WE BE WORRIED I'M JOINED BY VAL CURRAN WHO'S PROFESSOR OF PSYCHO PHARMACOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON AND MIKE POWELL WHO IS AN AUTHOR JOURNALIST SPECIALISING DRUG SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
PROFESSOR CURRAN YOU'RE NOT PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT ECSTASY I'M CONCERNED THERE'S BEEN SUCH A BIG INCREASE FIFTY PER CENT INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN THE NUMBER OF FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLDS USING A DRUG BUT THAT'S A BIT MORE CONCERNING IS THAT PURITY IS GONE UP HUGELY AND THE DOSE HAS GONE UP
PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT WHAT THEY USE THEY NEED TO BE MADE AWARE WE NEED TO EDUCATE PEOPLE MORE ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE DRUGS ARE OUT ON THE STREET BUT YOUR MAIN CONCERN IS NOT ECSTASY IS CANNABIS I THINK FROM THE REPORT CANNABIS IS USED BY MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE THAN USE ECSTASY AND WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER RECENT YEARS IS THAT THE THE STRENGTH OF CANNABIS HAS GONE UP ENORMOUSLY
AND PROBLEMS OF ADDICTION HAVE GONE UP ENORMOUSLY THROUGHOUT EUROPE IT'S JUST GONE THROUGH THE ROOF IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE SEEKING TREATMENT TO HELP THEM SO WHEN PEOPLE OLDER PEOPLE MOST I WAS USING CANNABIS SMOKING AND EVERY NIGHT IN YOUR ABILITY NEVER DID ME ANY HARM YOU WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY IT'S A DIFFERENT SORT OF CANNABIS AND THE STUFF THAT WAS AROUND FORTY YEARS AGO WAS WAS QUITE BENIGN
STUFF THAT'S AROUND NOW IS HE'S REALLY STRONG ESPECIALLY KIND OF FRIGHTENS PEOPLE CALL SKUNK THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF T. H. C. IN THEIR T.H.C. BEING FOR THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT AND THAT CAN INDUCE YOU PSYCHOSIS
RARELY BUT ADDICTION MORSI ADDICTION AND LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING A STUDY OF ALL THIS AND YOU AGREE WITH THAT'S A CROW IN CERTAIN RESPECTS I DO LIKE THAT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK AT HERE IS THAT PURITY AND INCREASE PURITY ITSELF DOES NOT DENOTE SAFETY THERE WAS A WONDERFUL PHRASE BY PARACELSUS THIS SWIFT SWISS SIXTEENTH CENTURY FATHER
TOXICOLOGY AND HE SAID SOLAR DOSAS FACET OF THE MOMENT WHICH MEANS TO DOGS MAKES THE POISON AND I THINK THAT THAT REALLY IS THE KEY THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE REPORT WHICH WAS THAT ECSTASY DOSAGES HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS FROM ABOUT EIGHTY MILLIGRAMS OF ONE HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS
AND SEVEN PILLS UP TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS WHICH IS SIMPLY TOO STRONG FOR MOST USERS TO TAKE SAFELY OR EVEN I WOULD ARGUE ENJOYABLY BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD A CORRESPONDING PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGN AROUND THIS WITH WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND USERS BEING ADVISED HOW TO USE THE DRUG MORE SAFELY PACKED IT REALLY IS THAT THE CASE I MEAN AREN'T THEY BEING
ENDLESSLY TOLD NOT TO USE DRUGS I MEAN THAT WASN'T YOU WERE COMING THE JUST SAY NO APPROACH DOESN'T WHAT HAS HAS FAILED SO WHAT YOU CLEARLY CLEARLY FAILED I THINK ANY ANYONE WORKING IN THE FIELD WOULD AGREE BUT AS MIKE SAYS IF YOU'RE GETTING TWO HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS OF ECSTASY IN PILLS
THEN WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING IS IF YOU HAVE IF YOU DESPERATELY WANT TO TAKE THE DRUG CUT THE PILL INTO HER QUARTERS TAKE ONE QUARTER AND WAIT FOR TWO HOURS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SAY IT DOESN'T COME WITH AN INFORMATION SHEET SAYING HOW MUCH IS IN THERE
YOU SAY IT JUST SAY NO DOESN'T WORK BUT BUT MIKE IT IF YOU SAY TO YOUNG PEOPLE GIVE IT A TRY SEE WHAT IT DOES TO YOU OR WHATEVER THE EDUCATION ADVICE SHOULD BE THEN
THERE ARE DANGERS IN THAT AS WELL WELL I THINK THERE ARE DANGERS AND EVERYTHING CAN DANGERS CAN BE MITIGATED AGAINST THEM THEY CAN BE MILITATES AGAINST THEM YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT SIMPLY CAN'T LEGISLATE AWAY PEOPLE'S DESIRE FOR A GOOD TIME AND YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE NOT TO TAKE A DRUGS BECAUSE IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HURT THEM
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM INSTEAD OPTIONS AND STRATEGIES WHICH HELP THEM TO MAKE AN INFORMED A BETTER DECISION TO SAFEGUARD THE HEALTH RATHER THAN SAYING DON'T DO IT SO IT'S ARE YOU NOT ARE YOU SAYING THERE SHOULD BE A LESS CENSORIOUS APPROACH BOTH OF YOU CERTAINLY I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE INFORMATIONAL APPROACHING I'VE GOT TO SAY ON THE RADIO NOW THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE AXIS YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE A BREAK THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD NOT TO DO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS AND THEY SHOULD KNOW THEIR DEALER
THEY SHOULD LIMIT OF THE DRUGS THEY SHOULDN'T USE ALCOHOL UNCLE CAME AT THE SCRATCHY TENDED TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS ILLEGAL HIGHLY ABSOLUTELY AND THEY ARE THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE YOU DO IT EVERY WEEKEND REGARDLESS OF WHAT I SAY YOU KNOW SO FOR ME THAT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE COMPLACENTLY SIT BACK AND ACCEPT THAT OR WHETHER WE ACTUALLY STEP IN MAKE POSITIVE INTERVENTION AND HELP PEOPLE TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS PROFESSOR CAN YES I AGREE AS A GREEK TOTALLY LOOK LIKE SAYS AND ALSO THESE KIDS ARE SEEING THEIR PARENTS KNOCKING THAT THE G. AND T. AND
USING ALCOHOL WITH THIS LEGAL IT'S THERE IS LEGAL BUT IT'S ALSO DAMAGING SO WE HAVE A KIND OF WE'RE NOT EDUCATING THE YOUNG FOLK IN A WAY THAT KIND OF GIVES THEM A PROPER BALANCE OF INFORMATION HOW DO YOU DO IT TO CAN YOU SEE HER STANDING THERE IN SCHOOL AND SAYING NOW LOOK NEXT TIME USE ECSTASY JUST DO THIS AND DO THAT THEY'D BEEN MURDERED
BY THEIR PARENTS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPENING IN SCHOOLS FROM AN EARLY AGE AS WELL THANK YOU ARE THERE YOU ARE THEN SAYING ALTHOUGH IT'S LEGAL HELLO ALTHOUGH IT IS ILLEGAL YOU CAN DO IT JUST BE CAREFUL I'M NOT SAYING YOU CAN DO IT AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE IT WHERE IT WAS SAYING IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO USE IT AND ARE SAYING IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT THESE ARE ALL THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TO MINIMISE HARM WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED

IN THE FIRST PLACE THE MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE'S SIMPLY NO EVIDENCE CAN THE STATE OF IRISH EXTRADITION LAW BACK IN THE SEVENTIES WHICH WOULD BE FOLLOWED NOW WOULD MEAN THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE EXTRADITED MY VIEW SO THE ONLY WAY THAT THERE COULD BE CONVICTIONS FOR THE PLUMBING ON BARNES WOULD BE F. ONE OR MORE OF THE BOMBERS WERE TO PRESENT THEMSELVES TO THE U.K. POLICE STATION AND MAKE FULL CONFESSIONS WHEN I DON'T BELIEVE THE DOUBLE UP
CAMPAIGNERS FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SAY A BRITISH WITHDRAW WOULD ALLOW THE INTRODUCTION OF A POINTS BASED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND AN END TO THE AUTOMATIC RIGHT OF E.U.
