THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOUISE THE TIME IS NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX OR LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND DAVID CAMERON GET IT IN THE NECK AND PRETTY WELL ALL OF THEM WAS FROM ONE OF THE ALMOST ALL LEAD WITH THIS WELL VERSIONS OF THIS HEADLINE HERE'S THE DAILY TELEGRAPH I DID HAVE THE MONEY OFFSHORE
THE GUARDIAN CAMERON FINALLY ADMITS YES SO I BENEFITED FROM TAX AVOIDING OFFSHORE FUNDS THE MIRROR BIT MORE BRUTAL DAVID CAMERON FACED CALLS TO QUIT AFTER FINALLY ADMITTING HE HAD INVESTED IN A TAX HAVEN P.M.S SECRET THIRTY THOUSAND STASHED IN THAT TAXI
THE TIMES MUCH THE SAME CAMERA AND I HELD SHARES IN OFFSHORE TAX HAVEN PATRICK KID IN HIS HER POLITICAL SKETCHES IN THE PAPER PUT IT LIKE THIS THIS WAS NOT HOW HE PLANNED TO MARK THE RETURN FROM THE BRIEF AS THE BEAST RECESS RECESSES THOSE BEERS IN LANZAROTE SEEM A LONG TIME AGO THE WEEK HAD BEEN SET ASIDE FOR A BIG PUSH ON EUROPE
INSTEAD HE HAS BEEN STALKED BY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HIS FAMILY PAID ENOUGH TAX OF PUBLIC RELATIONS EXPERT AT MISTER CAMERON ONCE CLASSED HIMSELF WOULD HAVE HANDLED THIS SO MUCH BETTER TELLING EARLY
TELL IT ALL TELL IT YOURSELF THAT WAS THE SUBTITLE OF A BOOK ON CRISIS MANAGEMENT BY LANNY DAVIS WHO WORK AS SPECIAL COUNSEL IN BILL CLINTON'S WHITE HOUSE
THE OTHER STORY ON THE FRONT PAGES IS THIS PRIVACY INJUNCTION PREVENTS THE MEDIA HERE FROM REPORTING ON THE ALLEGED EXTRAMARITAL ACTIVITIES OF A CELEBRITY IT HAS BEEN WIDELY REPORTED IN THE UNITED STATES BUT THERE IS AN INJUNCTION GRANTED BY A COURT OF APPEAL IN LONDON THAT PREVENTS THE BRITISH PRESS REVEALING THE IDENTITY OF THE MAN WHO IS APPARENTLY A WELL KNOWN MAN INVOLVED IN WHAT IS TO THE CALDER THREE WAY SEXUAL ENCOUNTER THE
PAPER'S VERY CROSS INDEED ABOUT IT AT THE DAILY MAIL THE FAST GOES ON HIS NAME'S NOW ALL OVER THE WEB THE MAIL SAYS BUT BRITAINS ARE STILL BANNED FROM KNOWING THE IDENTITY OF CELEBRITY FATHER IN LOVE CHEAT THREESOME AND THE SUN
ON ITS FRONT PAGE HAS WHAT IT SAYS IS AN EXCLUSIVE MY FURY AT ROMP GAGGING THREAT THE MAN WHO WAS GAGGED FROM TALKING ABOUT THE THREESOME INVOLVING THE TOP ENTERTAINER SAID LAST NIGHT I'VE BEEN THREATENED WITH JAIL FOR TELLING THE TRUTH HE FEELS BULLIED AND HARASSED BY THE PEOPLE CONCERNED THE MAN WAS HALF OF A COUPLE INVOLVED IN A THREE WAY
AND HE'S TOLD HIS STORY TO THE SUN IT IS NOW TEN PAST SIX TUT A STEEL FAMOUSLY COULDN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY SELLING STEEL IN PORT TALBOT ELSEWHERE IN THE U.K. BUT THERE ARE CLAIMS THAT THEY MADE A FAIR BIT OF MONEY BY SELLING CARBON EMISSION PERMITS ROGER ARROGANCE ON THE LINE OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST WHAT TERM IS THE ALLEGATION ABOUT WHAT THEY DID ROGER WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK ADJUSTING TO THE EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME IN THE Y. YOU WHEN HE STARTED TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE SERIOUSLY
THEY DECIDED THAT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING IT WAS TO GET FIRMS TO TRADE BETWEEN THEMSELVES IN CARBON EMISSIONS SO IF YOU COULDN'T CUT YOUR OWN POLLUTION YOU WOULD BUY A PERMIT PERMITS AND IF YOU COULD CUT YOUR OWN POLLUTION THEN YOU'D HAVE PERMITS TO SELL YOU'D BE ABLE TO MAKE MONEY THAT WAY AND SUBSIDISE THE EFFICIENCY GAIN SO IT ALL SOUNDS PERFECT EXCEPT THIS SO FIRST OF ALL THE GOVERNMENTS DECIDED THAT THEY COULDN'T SUBJECT THE HEAVY INDUSTRIES
TO THIS CARBON TAX BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE EXPOSED TO INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION SO WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH THEY'D GIVE THEM ENOUGH FREE ALLOWANCE HE SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BUY ANY ON THE MARKET ALL THE COMPANIES OF COURSE IN THIS IS NOT JUST TAT
ALL THE COMPANIES OVER BID WHY NOT WHY NOT OVER BID AND THE GOVERNMENT'S THOUGHT WOULD BETTER ERR ON THE CALL ON THE CAUTIOUS SIDE AND WE'LL GIVE THEM WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR THEY GAVE THEM WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR IT LEFT COMPANIES LIKE TARTARE WITH A HUGE AMOUNT OF PERMITS THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY NEED SOLD THEM ON THE MARKET AND IT LOOKS LIKE THREE SETS OF ANALYSIS OUT NOW AS TO HOW MUCH PROFIT THEY MADE FROM THAT AND IT LOOKS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS THEY MADE OUT OF A WINDFALL PROFIT FOR DOING NOTHING
RIGHT BUT NOT DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL OR WRONG IF THEY'RE FOR THE SCHEME WAS FAULTY INDEED ALMOST LUDICROUS AS YOU DESCRIBE IT THEN IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT OR TATA STEEL
YES I THINK THE PROBLEM WAS THAT GOVERNMENT THOUGHT IT WAS TOO RISKY TO TO IMPOSE THE STRICTURES ON THE HEAVY INDUSTRY SO I THINK LUDICROUS IT SEEMS LUDICROUS NOW BUT THEN IT DIDN'T SEEM LUDICROUS AND AS YOU SAY TATA STEEL HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG NOW WE PUT IT TO THEM THAT THEY HAD MADE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING YET THEY HAVEN'T OFFERED ANY ANSWER AT ALL
BUT I UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE BEEN IN CORRESPONDENCE WITH GREEN GROUPS AND THEY WERE MAKING THIS POINT THEMSELVES THAT WHO COULD BLAME THE SYSTEM IS THERE WHO COULD BLAME THEM FROM TRYING TO EXPLOIT IT BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING OF COURSE IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OUT THIS WEEK SAYING E. U. CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES THERE BANKRUPTING TATTER IT APPEARS THAT POSSIBLY THE OPPOSITE IS THE CASE WE CAN'T MAKE AN EXACT CALCULATION BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH TATTER MAY HAVE MADE MONEY BECAUSE THE CLIMATE POLICIES OVERALL TIMESTREAM ROGER THANKS
IT'S TWELVE MINUTES PAST NO IT'S NOT IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE POPE WILL TELL THE WORLD TODAY WHAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THINKS OF THE FAMILY ARE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT HAS CAROLINE WHITE AND THIS IS THE CONCLUSION CAROLINE HAVE TWO SYNODS ON THE FAMILY
THAT'S RIGHT TWO SINNERS IN THE FAMILY AND ALSO A QUESTIONNAIRE SENT OUT TO CATHOLICS AROUND THE WORLD IN THE YEAR BEFORE HE HELD THE FIRST SYNOD OF THE FAMILY AND THIS HAS BEEN A PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN REALLY QUITE DIVISIVE SOME SAFE FOR THE CHURCH BECAUSE THE BISHOP CAME TOGETHER AND THE COUPLES FROM AROUND THE WORLD AS WELL AS SOME LADY FAMILIES AND RELIGIOUS
AND JUMP THE POPE ALLOWED PEOPLE UNUSUALLY TO DEBATE AND TO ACTUALLY DISAGREE HE ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO SPEAK THEIR MIND WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH OR THE VATICAN RATHER WHO'S TRADITIONALLY DUCK AND IT EMERGED THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT VERY DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WORRIED THE PEOPLE IN AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE CONCERNS THAT MANY PEOPLE IN EUROPE EXPRESS IN AFRICA FOR SOME FAMILIES THEY SAID WELL ACTUALLY POLYGAMY
IT'S A PROBLEM AND WE'D RATHER THE PEOPLE DIDN'T DO THAT IN EUROPE A LOT OF THE TIME IT WAS SAYING WELL ACTUALLY WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE MORE ACCEPTING OF GAY CATHOLICS AND PERHAPS EVEN IN SOME COUNTRIES OF MARRIAGE SAME SEX MARRIAGE EQUAL MARRIAGE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT AND THE CARPALS DISAGREED QUITE BE IN THEM AND QUITE PUBLICLY ABOUT
WHICH WORRIED SOME PEOPLE ESPECIALLY CONSERVATIVE FOR THE PUPAE UNIT YOU'RE BREAKING UP A WEE BIT CALLOUS JUST TRY ONE MORE QUESTION SEE HOW HE GOES AND DIVORCE AS WELL THAT'S A BIG ISSUE ISN'T IT
IT'S A BIG ISSUE AND WHETHER CATHOLICS WHO HAD DIVORCED AND THEN TRIPOLI REMARRIED WITHOUT HAVING AN ANNULMENT FROM THE CHURCH SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE COMMUNION THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE IN EUROPE AND IN AMERICA BUT IN PARTICULAR I FEEL QUITE STRONGLY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING AWAY FROM THE CHURCH BECAUSE DIVORCE IS VERY COMMONPLACE NOT SO MANY PEOPLE GET ANNULMENT FEAST DAYS
AND PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE CHURCH SOME OF THEM OR UNABLE TO PARTAKE OF COMMUNION AND MANY ON THE MORE LIBERAL SIDE OF THE CHURCH WERE SAID THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE THERE SHOULD BE A PATH TOWARDS PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO TAKE ME ESPECIALLY IF THE DIVORCE THE END OF THEIR MARRIAGE WHICH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH STILL PEACHES IS FOR LIFE
WAS NOT THEIR FAULT SO PEOPLE WAITING VERY EAGERLY TO SEE IF THE POPE EITHER CHANGES DOCTRINE ON THAT WHICH WE THINK IS UNLIKELY OR THOUGH SAYS THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE AWAY FOR SOME CHURCHES SOME BISHOP SOME KRIS TO FIND A WAY TO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN DIVORCED TO TAKE ME KAREN THANKS A LOT
COULD BUST SIX TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE WORLD OF MAMMON THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PLANNING A CLAMPDOWN ON V.A.T. FRAUD IS TINY YES GOOD MORNING IT'S ABOUT V.A.T. L. BUT I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT AS LIVELY AND INTERESTING AS POSSIBLE AT SIX FIFTY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS LAID OUT A PLAN TO REFORM OF THE CURRENT E.U. V.A.T. SYSTEM IT WOULD MAKE IT SIMPLER AS THE IDEA MORE FRAUD PROOF BUSINESS FRIENDLY POINTS TO A V.A.T. GAP THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EXPECTED V.A.T. REVENUE
AND THAT WHICH IS ACTUALLY COLLECTED WITHIN THE E.U. WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION EUROS IN FACT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN DOWN THE LINE JOINING US TO EXPLAIN WHY SO MUCH GOES MISSING IS INCOMPETENT HE IS HEAD OF INDIRECT TAX AT A WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME WHY DOES SO MUCH V.A.T. GO MISSING
GOOD MORNING TANYA AND I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS THE E.U. ITSELF IN STUDY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT
FIFTY BILLION EUROS GOES MISSING IN RELATION TO CROSS BROADER FRAUD AND THE REST BEING IN RELATION TO DOMESTIC FRAUD TAX AVOIDANCE AND MALLETS MINISTRATIONS OF THAT SYSTEM AND EVER IS IN RELATION TO V.A.T. BY BUSINESSES WHO ARE GENERALLY TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT BUT JUST
THRILL TO DO SO AND FRANKLY FELT LADLE IT'S A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED ISN'T IT IT IS AND I THINK THAT'S THE THE FOCUS OF THE VAT ACTION PLAN WAS BEING LOOKED AT HERE THEY'RE VERY MUCH INDICATING THAT THEY SEE THAT THAT SYSTEM IS VERY BURDENSOME VERY COMPLEX ON BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEY'RE LOOKING TO BRING IN MEASURES TO REDUCE THAT AND AND COMBAT FRAUD RIGHT SO MOST OF US COME ACROSS V.A.T. WHEN WE BUY SOMETHING BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY SEE IT IN THE U.K. DO WE SO HOW DOES IT WORK
V.A.T. IN THE U.K. IS COLLECTED ON GOODS AND SERVICES THAT WE BUY NOT ALL GOODS AND SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO V.A.T. AS I THINK MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT MANY FOOD ITEMS AREN'T BUT MANY NORMAL STANDARD ITEMS LIKE TELEVISIONS MOBILE PHONES IN THE AMOUNT THAT WE PAY OVER FOR THOSE GOODS AND SERVICES IS AN AMOUNT OF V.A.T. WHICH IS THEN PAID OVER TO THE GOVERNMENT
RIGHT AND OF COURSE THE U.K. HAS SOME ABILITY TO ALTER THE AMOUNT OF V.A.T. THAT IT CHARGES AND WEAR IT PLACES EXCEPTIONS HENCE THE DISCUSSION RECENTLY ABOUT SANITARY PRODUCT
THAT'S CORRECT AND THAT'S ALSO A FOCUS OF THE V.A.T. ACTION PLAN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS PROPOSING THE MEMBER STATES WILL HAVE A GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO CHOOSE WHICH PRODUCTS THEY LEVY V.A.T. ON WHICH PRODUCTS THAT THEY DON'T WHY IS IT PARTICULARLY OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF NOT BEING PAID AS A TOWN WHAT
THERE'S MANY FACTORS ONE I THINK THE ONE YOU IDENTIFIED IS THAT LARGE YOU DON'T SEE IT WHEN YOU PAY IT AS AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE E.U. COMMISSION IS IDENTIFIED AS THE MAIN AREA OF FRAUD WHICH IS CROSS BORDER FRAUD WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IS THAT
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THAT WORKS WHEN YOU SELL GOODS CROSS BORDER YOU CAN HAVE A TAX CHEAT IN ONE COUNTRY EFFECTIVELY BUYING GOODS PAYING NO V.A.T. ON THOSE GOODS BECAUSE THOSE GOODS ARE BEING SHIPPED TO THE COUNTRY WHICH THEY'VE SET UP THEIR BUSINESS
THEY THEN SELL THOSE GOODS AND DISAPPEAR BEFORE PAYING THEIR V.A.T. OVER TO THE GOOD THE RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITY SO THIS AGAIN THE E.U. COMMISSION IS LOOKING AT PROPOSALS TO REDUCE THAT FRAUD
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US NOW LET'S TURN OUR THOUGHTS TO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ON THE MARKETS AT CHRIS RALPH HE'S WITH ME NOW IT'S NOT BEEN GOING VERY WELL HAS IT SHE'S CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE AT SAINT JAMES' PLACE CHRIS GIVEN THAT SAINT JAMES' PLACE IS A WEALTH MANAGEMENT BUSINESS
YOU NO DOUBT WILL BE INTERESTED EVERY TIME YOU SEE STORIES ON TAX AND MOVES TO TIGHTEN IT UP DO YOU SEE NOW THE WAVE OF CHANGE REVOLUTION GOING THROUGH THEIR WEALTH MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY WERE PEOPLE PERHAPS WILL BE LESS INCLINED TO SAVE MONEY OFFSHORE
I THINK IT COMES BACK TO THE WHOLE OF THE REGULATION ENVIRONMENT AND THE LINKS BETWEEN NOT ONLY A DOMESTIC REGULATORS THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY IN THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY BUT THE OFFSHORE REGULATORS TO JEN SPACE HAS AN OFFSHORE BUSINESS THAT'S BASED IN DUBLIN THAT'S VERY
CAREFULLY AND SENSIBLY REGULATED BY THE CENTRAL BANK OF IRELAND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE REGULATOR ENVIRONMENT IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS OR OR IN PANAMA AND JUST FOR THE VOIDS HAVE AND PLACE HAS NO LINK WITH WITH MOSS AND TAKA ITSELF
O.K. LET'S MOVE ON TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKETS BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT TO YOU TOO IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT TIME YOU SEE A LOSSES IS THE DAY I WAS DOWN ABOUT ONE PER CENT THE NICK HE'S ACTUALLY DONE A BIT BETTER THIS MORNING BUT IT IS AN AWKWARD TIME FOR THE MARKETS WHAT OF THE FACTORS DO YOU THINK THERE ARE MAKING THEM EDGY
WELL I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE MARKETS PERFORMANCE IN IN MARCH IT'S WHAT I CALL THAT HIPPO MARKET IT'S BEEN SORT OF WALLOWING ALONG LONG AFTER THE THAT THE FOOT THE SHOP FOUR WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY AND THEN THE RECOVERY THROUGH THE LATTER PART OF JANUARY AND INTO FEBRUARY I THINK WHAT MARKETS A FOCUSED ON IS IS HOW THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS DOING AND IT WAS QUITE AND THEY'RE NOT SHORT WELL IF IT'S THAT QUESTION INDEED THERE'S DIFFERENT NEWS COMING OUT WHETHER YOU LOOK AT WHAT JENNY WAS SAYING YESTERDAY
I'M SAYING THAT THE U.S. ISN'T ISN'T IN A IN A BUBBLE A THE JOBS NEWS WE HAD FROM THE U.S. EARLIER IN THE WEEK WAS ACTUALLY MIGHT IF YOU'RE NOT WELL OR WHAT SHE WAS SAYING IS THAT THE THE PRIMING THAT THE U.S. ECONOMY HAS BEEN GIVEN FROM THE QUANTITATIVE EASING PROGRAMME HAS NOT CREATED AND ECONOMY THAT IS UNSUSTAINABLE GOING FORWARD SHE'S OBVIOUSLY REFLECTING ON THE JOB STATE HER AND SAYING ACTUALLY THIS IS AN ECONOMY THAT'S CREATING GOOD QUALITY JOBS AREN'T STAYING WITH THE U.S. A LOT OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
HAVE BEEN CALLED OFF FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT THIS IS CAUSING QUITE A BIT OF CONSTERNATION ISN'T IT WITH THIS HAS BEEN A FASCINATING SO IT'S BEEN GOING ON DURING THE WEEK THIS THIS MASSIVE DEAL THAT'S BEEN ABANDONED BETWEEN FAIZA AND ALLERGEN FOR ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER DEALS SO WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT THE GREAT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF DEAL ABANDONMENT SO FAR AND IN TWENTY SIX IN THERE WE'VE HAD RUN AND THAT WAS A TAX ISSUE OF COURSE TAXING VERSION INDEED YES BECAUSE ALLERGEN ATTACKS THOMAS HARDIN IN DUBLIN
BUT THERE ARE NEW JERSEY COMPANY AND INDEED IS O.K. BUT WHAT OTHER ONES HAVE BEEN CALLED OFF WHERE THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER DIFFERENT NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES THAT THAT HAVE BEEN THAT HAVE CALLED OFF THEIR COMPETITION IN DEED AND JUST WHERE THEY FELT THAT THERE WASN'T THE THE BUSINESS NECESSITY TO PURSUE THAT ACQUISITION OH KAY LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ON THE CURRENCY SIDE BIT REAL CONCERNS ONCE AGAIN ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE YEN OR WHAT
POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT MIGHT HAVE ON JAPAN'S ECONOMY YES IT CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN SOME SUBSTANTIAL STRENGTHENING OF THE YEN RELATIVE TO THE U.N. TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AND I DOESN'T HELP THE PROSPECTS FOR DEFLATION WEIGHT DOESN'T HELP THE PROSPECT FOR DEFLATION ARE CLEARLY DOESN'T HELP JAPANESE COMPANIES OPERATING IN THAT IN ENVIRONMENT IT'S INTERESTING AND ALMOST IRONIC THAT THE END IS ALMOST BEEN SEEN AS A SAFE HAVEN CURRENCY AND THAT IN SOME PEOPLE'S MINDS
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOR JAPANESE BANKS TO TO TO TO DO REASONABLY WELL IN THE END NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WHERE IS AND THAT'S PARTLY WHY MONEY AND APPETITE IS RETURNING TO THE JAPANESE MARKET
WHERE WAS THE RATHER SAYING THAT TO PANDY STOW JAPAN NEEDS TO THAT JAPANESE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AGAIN JUST A BRIEF WORD ON PAY WE'VE BEEN HEARING THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE KOP GROUP OF COURSE THIS WEEK BUT ALSO B.P. ARE RATHER INTERESTING STORY SURROUNDING PAY THEIR B.P. DID NOT HAVE A GOOD YEAR LAST YEAR AND YET THE C.E.O. IS BEING PAID
SO IT SEEMS ALL THE INTENTION IS THAT HE WILL BE PAID QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL SUM WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT QUITE SUBSTANTIAL BEING RATHER UNDERSTATED DAILY TWENTY MILLION BUCKS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT INDIVIDUALS NEED TO BE PAID ON PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THEIR JOB AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THAT THERE PAID FOR INDIVIDUALS IS NOT SET BY THAT TO THE CHIEF EXEC TO HIMSELF IT SET LINE INDEPENDENT REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
BUT IN A MARKET AS YOU SAY WHERE B.P. SHARES HAVE FALLEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND AND IT COULD BE ARGUED THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE HAS NOT BEEN AS GOOD IT BUT BECAUSE IT WAS IN PREVIOUS YEARS ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT SOME SHAREHOLDERS ARE STANDING UP AND SAYING WHY SHOULD WASH HER POPPA DEE BE PAID MORE AND IT APPEARS THAT'S WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US THANK YOU

TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN DAVID CAMERON HAS COME CLEAN HE DID PROFIT FROM HIS LATE FATHER'S OFFSHORE INVESTMENT FUND AND IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE ATTACKS TO BEGIN HERE'S LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON ON NEWSNIGHT HE'S MADE JUDGEMENTS ON PEOPLE AS PRIME MINISTER
FOR DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE USED TO DO I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD LOOK FOR A PRIME MINISTER TO USE THE LINE DO AS I SAY NOT AS I DO AND THE AVOIDANCE OF LEGITIMATE JOURNALISTIC QUESTIONS IN THE LAST THREE DAYS
JUST MEANS THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HIS FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE AS BOTH AS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION AND THERE'S AN M.P. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S UNREASONABLE FOR PEOPLE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS ELEANOR GO ON HERE ARE THEY ASKING WITH WITH IT WITH ANY REAL SENSE OF ANGER ELEANOR YEAH I THINK I THINK THEY ARE I THINK LABOUR ARE POINTING OUT THAT ALTHOUGH DAVID CAMERON'S PROBLEM PROMISED TO PUBLISH HIS TAX RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THEY'RE SAYING THAT ACTUALLY WON'T NECESSARILY REVEAL IF HE HAD ANY OTHER SHARES IN BLAIR MORE WHETHER HE GOT RID OF ANY OTHER SHAREHOLDINGS BEFORE TWENTY TEN AS WE HEARD THEY'RE CALLING IT AN EXTRAORDINARY ADMISSION AND WE'VE GOT THE S.N.P. SAYING MISTER CAMERON HAS PLAYED THE PUBLIC
AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FIND IT VERY HARD TO TRUST HIM NO DOUBT DOWNING STREET HAS BEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE THIS WEEK WE'VE GRADUALLY HAD HIS INFORMATION'S SQUEEZED OUT OF NUMBER TEN A TRICKLE AT A TIME FIRST WE WERE TOLD IT WAS A PRIVATE MATTER THEN MISTER CAMERON SAID HE CURRENTLY HAD NO OFFSHORE FUNDS AND TRUSTS THEN WE HAD THE CLARIFICATION HIS FAMILY WOULDN'T BENEFIT IN THE FUTURE AND THEN FINALLY OF COURSE LAST NIGHT HE'S ADMISSION HE HAD
AFTER ALL BENEFITED FROM AN OFFSHORE FUND IN THE PAST HE SOLD A SHAREHOLDING FOR AROUND THIRTY THOUSAND HE SAID HE PAID INCOME TAX ON THEIR DIVIDENDS FOR THEIR BOUGHT NUMBER TEN SO HE'S BEEN MORE OPEN THAN ANY OTHER PRIME MINISTER IN LIVING MEMORY THEY INSIST THAT THEY'VE ANSWERED QUESTIONS AS THEY CAME ALONG AND NEITHER DAVID CAMERON ALL HIS FATHER HAD DONE ANYTHING ILLEGAL OF COURSE LAST NIGHT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS INSISTING THAT BLAIR MORE HADN'T BEEN SET UP WITH THE INTENTION
OF ENABLING HIS INVESTORS TO AVOID TAX I THINK IT'S UNLIKELY THERE'LL BE MORE SIGNIFICANT REVELATIONS THAN THE FACT THAT HE DID BENEFIT FROM AN OFFSHORE TRUST SOMETHING OF COURSE THAT LEGAL BUT OVER WHICH PEOPLE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT SO WHERE WHERE DOES IT GO NOW THEN ARE WE GOING TO BE LOOKING BACK IN A COUPLE OF WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT
WELL NEXT WEEK LABOUR ARE DEMANDING AT THE PRIME MINISTER COMES TO THE COMMONS TO GIVE A STATEMENT ABOUT HIS TAX AFFAIRS WILL OF COURSE GET THE PUBLICATION OF HIS TAX RETURN I HAVE TO DO THAT HE SAID HE'S COMFORTABLE DOING THAT AND HE SAID THAT HAD BEEN TOLD BY DOWNING STREET IS GOING TO HAPPEN IT WILL HAPPEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT THE QUESTIONS WILL STREET WILL KEEP COMING FROM LABOUR AND JOURNALIST TO THE WHOLE PROBLEM IS POLITICAL IMAGE IT IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AND HE'S CURRENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS POLITICAL FIGHT OF HIS LIFE BATTLING TO KEEP BRITAIN
IN THE E.U. THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT RIDING ON HIS HIS SHOULDERS AND ANYTHING THAT DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM THE ELECTORATE IS NOT GOING TO HELP ARE ONE THING A DOWNING STREET SOURCE TOLD ME LAST NIGHT I THINK THE SIGNIFICANT THEY ADMITTED THAT WELL KNOWN PHRASE THAT HINDSIGHT IS A WONDERFUL THING A CLEAR ADMISSION I THINK THAT THEY DO THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY IF THEY HAD THE CHANCE AGAIN ELEANOR THANKS A LOT
IT IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN A SECOND WAVE OF MIGRANTS WAS BEING DEPORTED TODAY FROM GREECE TO TURKEY FROM THE GREEK ISLAND OF LESBOS INDEED THE FIRST BOAT HAS LEFT I THINK ALREADY SOPHIE LONG'S ART CORRESPONDENT THERE WHAT'S HAPPENING SOPHIE WELL JUSTIN YES AS YOU SAY JUST AFTER WEDNESDAY MORNING FOR BUSES WRITER AT THE PORT CELINE O.K. FORTY FIVE
DANI MEN AND THEY LEFT THE WARRIOR CLOSE DETENTION CAMP EARLY THIS MORNING WITHOUT RESISTANCE WERE TOLD
THEY WERE GREETED HERE AT THE PORTS FOR MY SMALL THAT YOU'RE VERY NOISY
CHANTING THE SHAME ON YOU ANY MORE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE WEIGHTS ON HERE FOR THEM CALMLY HE'S AN M.P. ACCOMPANIED BY
THE BORDER AGENCY SO JUST BEFORE THE FERRY WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE THREE PROTESTERS DIVED INTO THE
WITH THIS MAN TO THE FRONT WITH A VERY DELAYING HIM DEPARTURE
BY A FEW MINUTES FOR THAT PERRY IS NOW EN ROUTE I'LL TELL YOU THE JENNY BACK OF COURSE WILL BE A FAVOUR ONE THAT'S A DIFFICULT ONE FOR THEM NONETHELESS THEY CAME HERE IT WAS
FILLED WITH HOPE YOU HAVE A BETTER LIFE IN EUROPE AND THEY RETURNED TODAY POLISH THAT THAT IS NOT TO BE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM
WITH ME WITH THEM HE WAS HERE IN THE REMOTE ON THEMSELVES WELL THE FIRST WAVE LEFT HERE LAST MONDAY TWO HUNDRED AND TWO PEOPLE WERE TO PUT THOSE BACK TURKEY GREASE ON THAT OCCASION
THEY WAITED AT THE QUARTERLY MISCELLANY BY A SMALL TENT ON THE QUAYSIDE THERE
AND THEN WERE PROCESSED BY TURKEY OFFICIALS THERE TAKEN
I BELIEVE IT TO REFUGEE CAMPS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR GROUP AS WITH THE GREEK THE LEFT HERE ON MONDAY IS THAT THEY HAD NOT APPLIED FOR ASYLUM NOW THERE IS A NEW
FAST TRACK ASYLUM PROCESS THAT CAME TO VET HERE ON FRIDAY
BUT EVEN UNDER THAT FAST TRACK SYSTEM IT'LL TAKE AT LEAST A WEEK FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL CASES TO BE HEARD
IF THEY APPEAL TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DEPORTED SO FAR FROM
GREECE TO TURKEY HAVE NOT APPLIED FOR ASYLUM
OH KAY SOPHIE THANK YOU BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN GO STRAIGHT TO TO TURKEY NOW AND HER LIFE HER MARK LEARN OUR CORRESPONDENT THERE AND THE QUESTION AND THE THING THAT HAS BEEN RAISED ISN'T IT BY HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS AND OTHERS IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE IN TURKEY IS IS UNCLEAR AND NOT NECESSARILY FAIR ON THEM
WELL THAT WAS A CONCERN CERTAINLY RAISE BEFORE MONDAY'S PROCESS BEGAN JUST BUT SEEM TO RUN FAIRLY SMOOTHLY ON MONDAY THE PAKISTANI WHO RETURNED HERE TO DICKIE FROM I'M SPEAKING TO YOU NOW ON MONDAY WERE TAKEN TO DEPORTATION CENTRES THEY WILL HAVE THEIR CASE IS ASSESSED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IF THEY ARE DEEMED TO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA TO STAY HERE IN TURKEY THEY'LL WILL BE SENT BACK TO PAKISTAN UNDER READMISSION AGREEMENT SIGNED BY TURKEY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS SO EXPECT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO THE SECOND WAVE AS WELL I'M LOOKING OUT AT THE KIDDIE AT THE MOMENT I CAN'T YET SEE THE BOAT COMING IN FROM LES BOSS IT'S ABOUT A FORTY MINUTE JOURNEY SOPHIE THERE SAID THAT THEY HAVE JUST LEFT SO WE EXPECT THE PULLEY ARRIVE IN ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES SOMETHING AND THERE'S A LITTLE WHITE TENT HERE WHERE THEY'LL BE PROCESSED AND THEN TAKEN OFF TO A DEPORTATION CENTRE WHERE SUPPOSE THESE EASY PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SYRIANS WHAT WHAT WHEN SYRIANS START TO ARRIVE PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY DESPERATELY
WHAT DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO SYRIA CAN'T ACTUALLY GO BACK TO SAY THEY HAVEN'T GOT PLACES TO GO TO WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM THEY WILL GO MOST OF THEM TO REFUGEE CAMPS ON TACKY SOUTHERN BORDER WITH SYRIA AND THEY WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF SIRI REFUGEES WHO WILL BE DIRECTLY RESETTLED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AS PART OF THIS DEAL AND THE FIRST GROUP OF THOSE WERE ALREADY RESETTLED IN GERMANY A COUPLE OTHER COUNTRIES FINLAND AND PORTUGAL I THINK EARLIER IN THE WEEK
AND SO THAT IS PART OF THE SORT OF SO CALLED ONE FOR ONE DEAL IT'S CONTROVERSIAL IT COME A CRITICISM FROM THE FROM VARIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS AND FOR SOME E.U. COUNTRIES WELL YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S FAIR AND YESTERDAY JUSTIN THE TURKISH PRESIDENT WAS QUITE OUTSPOKEN HE SAID TURKEY WILL ONLY STICK TO THE STEEL IF YE E. USE STICKS TO ITS SIDE OF THE BARGAIN NAMELY THAT TURKEY SHOULD GET ANOTHER THREE BILLION EUROS FROM THE E.U. BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN HE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER AREA OF ITS E.U. ACCESSION PROCESS OPENED OF SEVERAL CHAPTER
AND TURK SHOULD BE GIVEN VISA FREE TRAVEL TO THE SHANG AND PART OF THE E.U. THAT'S MOST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION NOT BRITAIN BY THE END OF JUNE IF TURKEY FULFILS CONDITION SO TACKY PLAYING HARDBALL WITH THIS AND SAYING LOOK WE'RE ONLY GOING TO STICK TO OUR SIDE OF THE DEAL IF HE STICKS TO HIS SIDE OF THE BARGAIN AS WELL MARK LEARN IN DICKIE LEE AND SOPHIE LONG AS WELL UNLESS THANKS NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND DAVID CAMERON THE DISCLOSURES ABOUT HIS
PREVIOUS INVESTMENT IN AN OFFSHORE COMPANY SET UP BY HER FATHER THE BIG STORY FOR MANY OF THEM THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN FORCED TO COMMIT TO PUBLISHING HIS TAX RETURNS AFTER ONE OF HIS WORST WEEKS IN OFFICE SAYS VOTERS RESPECT POLITICIANS WHO WERE STRAIGHTFORWARD IN BONDS TO CAMERON'S REVELATION WAS HARDLY A CRIME HIS DELAY IN SHARING THE INFORMATION MAY CAUSE HIM SOME POLITICAL DISCOMFORT
JOHN HARRIS IN THE GUARDIAN TALKS ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVES MASK HAVING SLIPPED WHAT CYNICAL OLD LEFTIES TALK ABOUT IS THE VENAL PURSUIT OF CLASS INTERESTS SUDDENLY LOOKS LIKE A MATTER OF UNANSWERABLE FACT HE SAYS THE MIRROR'S POLITICAL EDITOR JASON BEATTIE IS EQUALLY UNSYMPATHETIC HE SAYS THE TRUTH WAS DRAGGED FROM MISTER CAMERON AFTER YEARS OF DIVING AND DODGING WHICH WOULD SHAME ARTHUR DALEY
THE STORY OF TWO TEENAGE GIRLS GIVEN LIFE SENTENCES FOR MURDERING A VULNERABLE WOMAN AND HARTLEPOOL IS VERY WIDELY REPORTED KILLER GIRL STIFLED YAWN ZE AS THEY WERE JAILED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS SAYS THE TIME'S A REFERENCE TO THE MINIMUM TURN THE GIRLS WILL HAVE TO SERVE IT SO THE TEENAGERS CANNOT BE NAMED BECAUSE THE JUDGE'S SENTENCE THEM RULE THAT THEIR WELFARE WAS MORE IMPORTANT IN THE INTERESTS OF OPEN JUSTICE THE DAILY EXPRESS SAYS THE GIRLS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR A SEVEN A ORGY OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THEIR VICTIM ANGELA WRITES
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN MUCH LONGER SENTENCES HAD THEY BEEN ADULTS SEVERAL PAPERS REPORT THAT N.H.S. OFFICIALS ARE PLANNING TO RECRUIT UP TO FOUR HUNDRED G. PEAS FROM INDIA TO PLUG A STUFFING SHORTAGES THE GUARDIAN SAYS G.P. LEADERS CONSIDER THIS AS AN ADMISSION OF FAILURE BY THE GOVERNMENT IT CAST DOUBT ON ITS PROMISE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER
OF GENERAL PRACTICE DOCTORS BY FIVE THOUSAND WITHIN FOUR YEARS THE MAIL SAYS IT'S IRONIC THAT THE HEALTH SERVICE WHICH IS REPORTED TO BE AT BREAKING POINT IN PART BECAUSE A SURGE IN THE NUMBER OF E.U. MIGRANTS TRYING TO BRING IN DOCTORS FROM INDIA TO SOLVE THE CRISIS
AND A HEADLINE CATCHING DYNASTY THE DAILY MIRROR REPORTS THE COLLECTION OF CHINESE CERAMICS BROUGHT BY A FARMER FROM WILTSHIRE SEVERAL DECADES AGO ARE SOLD AT AUCTION IN HONG KONG FOR NEARLY FIFTEEN MILLION POUNDS DESCENDANTS OF THE LATE ROGER PILKINGTON FROM THE GLASSWARE FAMILY SOLD OFF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED RARE PIECES THAT HE HAD GATHERED OVER SEVERAL YEARS A FLASK DATING BACK TO THE MING DYNASTY RICH
SPORT FOR LESSON THREE THOUSAND FETCH MORE THAN TEN MILLION AT THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE ASIAN ART MARKET HAS BEEN BOOMING FOR THE PAST DECADE AS CHINA'S GROWING AFFLUENT CLASSES BY BACK THEIR LOST HERITAGE IT IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN ON THE MENUS THIS MORNING AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING DAVID CAMERON HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF HYPOCRISY AFTER HE REVEALED THAT HE DID BENEFIT FROM HIS FATHER'S OFFSHORE INVESTMENT FUND WHICH WAS MENTIONED IN THE PANAMA PAPERS
AND THE REVERBERATIONS FROM THOSE PAPERS HAVE BEEN FELT ALL OVER THE WORLD ONE COUNTRY THOUGH WHERE THE FALL OUT HAVE SO FAR BEEN PRETTY MINIMAL IS RUSSIA DESPITE THE FACT THE LEEK FILES REVEALED SUSPECTED BILLION DOLLAR MONEY LAUNDERING RING INVOLVING CLOSE ASSOCIATES WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN THE KREMLIN AND THE STATE MEDIA HAVE DISMISSED THE INVESTIGATION IS SPECULATION AND ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT RUSSIA
AND ITS PRESIDENT THE WORK AT THE AMERICANS WANT THE RUSSIAN PUBLIC MAKE OF IT ALL OUR CORRESPONDENT STEVE ROSENBERG TRAVEL TO SMALL TOWN FORTY MILES FROM MOSCOW TO FIND
DRIVE TWO HOURS EAST OF MOSCOW
AND YOU'LL COME TO A TOWN WHICH IN THE DAYS OF THE TSARS WAS CALLED SETI SHEER PEACE AND QUIET
AND EVERYTHING HERE WAS PEACEFUL AND QUIET UNTIL THEY BUILT A GIANT MYTHOLOGICAL PLANT A MUNITIONS FACTORY AND HEAVY MACHINE BUILDING PRODUCTION
UNDER COMMUNISM THE TOWN WAS RENAMED ELECTRO STEEL TO REFLECT THE ABSENCE OF PEACE
COMMUNISM COLLAPSED A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO BUT TODAY LIKE MANY PLACES IN RUSSIA ELECTRO STEEL STILL HAS A LENIN SQUARE
AND THE SOVIET STREET I'M ABOUT TO DISCOVER IT HAS SOMETHING ELSE TO THAT WAS VERY COMMON IN THE U.S.A.
A DEEP SUSPICION OF THE WEST
SO I NICKED THE NUMB SKI AT THEM
AT A NEWSPAPER KIOSK I ASK SALESWOMAN JESTER WHAT SHE THINKS OF THE PANAMA PEEPERS AND CLEAN LINES OF A MONEY LAUNDERING RING CLOSE TO THE KREMLIN BY ROAST ON THAT'S GRAND THAT WHEN YOU GO
I HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS YOU LEAD YOURS TO REPLIES NOT YOU PERSONALLY BUT TO YOUR COUNTRY AND ALL THAT SKI MATE WE KNOW YOUR GAME
THEN THEY'RE JUST UP CALLS OVER HER FRIEND THE ICE CREAM SELLER MAGGIE
ONLY IF YOU STOP IT YES
MARINA COME HERE THEY'RE TRYING TO RUB PUTIN'S FACE IN THE DIRT WITH AIRPORTS IN THE LEATHER I SEE YOU'LL HAVE TO DON'T THEY
WE'RE FOR PUTIN WEAR FOR RUSSIA MARINA DECLARES THE WEST JUST WANTS TO TOPPLE HIM AND PUT ONE OF ITS OWN IN HIS PLACE
IF YOU THINK OF THE VICTIM OPINION YOU'VE PROMISED BUT ALL THESE REPORTS OF OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS TAX EVASION MONEY LAUNDERING CLOSE TO THE KREMLIN DOESN'T THAT WORRY YOU I ASK WHY YOU WANT TO HANG IT
PEOPLE HIGH UP HAVE ALWAYS HAVE ACCOUNTS LIKE THESE AND THEY ALWAYS WILL MARINA SAYS
AND PUTIN CAN'T KEEP AN EYE ON EVERYONE I ONCE THEY'VE SEEN IT WAS HE DID NOTHING
AT THE ELECTRO STEEL HAIR SALON MANAGER GALINA BELIEVES THAT RUSSIA IS A CUT ABOVE THE WEST
WHAT DUST ON THAT'S THEM THIS VERY YOU'VE GOT THERE A SORT OF IT'S BAD THAT WE HAVE ENEMIES LIKE AMERICA BUT WILL ALWAYS CRITICISE RUSSIA BELINA SAYS THE AMERICANS JUST WANT TO CONQUER THE WORLD
I'M CERTAIN THAT PUTIN HAS NO CONNECTION AT ALL TO THESE ALLEGED ACCOUNTS SURVEY DID SHE WAS JUST PUTTING THEM AT NAZIR'S MY YOU LITERALLY MEAN LATER IN THE ELECTRO STEAL PARK I MEET A MATHEMATICIAN CALLED BORIS
WHAT DOES HE THINK ABOUT ALLEGATIONS THAT PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT HAVE BEEN CHANNELLING HUGE SONGS THROUGH OFFSHORE COMPANIES THEN YOU A BIT THAT I FELL ASLEEP AT THEIR MUM NIA WELL IT DOESN'T AFFECT MY LIFE IN ANY WAY BORIS REPLIES
IF IT DOESN'T AFFECT ME OR THE PEOPLE AROUND ME THEN AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT DOESN'T EXIST
AND ANYWAY WHO IS THE GREATEST LEADER OF MODERN TIMES ON YOUR OWN IF YOU CAN REALLY GET MISTER THIS IS PRECISELY THE PICTURE STATE T. V. AND RUSSIA PAINTS HEROIC PUTAIN
VERSES EVIL WEST THE MESSAGE IS SO POWERFUL THAT IT OFTEN OVERRIDE THE SCEPTICISM SOME PEOPLE DO HAVE ABOUT WHAT T. V. IS TELLING THEM
JEAN THE GRIGORI IS AN ENGLISH TEACHER IN ELECTRIC STEEL
MOST MEDIA TELL LIES DO YOU MEAN HERE AND AND THE WEST I THINK OF IT EVERYWHERE I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND THIS TOOL
YOUR PRESIDENT IS OFTEN CRITICISED BY THE WEST IS NOD TO US CRITICISING SHE IS YOUR PRESENT
AND HE BEHAVES CORRECTLY AND ACCUSATIONS FROM THE WEST THAT HE HAS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NO I IF YOU IS THESE ACCUSATIONS ARE NOT TO WRITE ACCUSATIONS NECESSARY
OUR ENEMIES UNFORTUNATELY IN THE ORIGINAL
BUT I DO HAVE ONE THAT WAS DONE WHEN YOU'VE GOT THEM IN THE YEMEN BEFORE I LEAVE ELECTRIC STEEL I GET CHATTING TO A PENSIONER CALLED ELLA
SHE SITTING ON THE PAVEMENT SELLING SOCKS AND STOCKINGS TO SUPPLEMENT HER PENSION
YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IF ANYONE WOULD GET ANGRY ABOUT ALLEGATIONS OF HUGE SUMS OF MONEY BEING SQUIRRELED ABROAD IT WOULD BE ELLA BUT SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE
AT THIS AND THAT'S FROM THAT'S DOING THE BELGIANS EAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS EVER SAYS
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE HEAD OF STATE HAS THE RIGHT TO BE WELL OFF HE CARRIES SUCH A RESPONSIBILITY
TO MANY RUSSIANS POWER AND WEALTH GO HAND IN HAND AND MANY HERE REMAIN SUSPICIOUS OF THE WEST
AS LONG AS RUSSIANS ARE FOCUSED ON ENEMIES HAVE BROUGHT THEIR LEADERS AT HOME WILL FEEL
STEVEN ROSENBERG REPORTING FROM RUSSIA THE TIME ELEVEN MINISTER SEVEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TOLD THAT IF THEY WANT TO GET ON THEY NEED TO DO WELL ACADEMICALLY ALL GET A DECENT APPRENTICESHIP BUT THAT APPROACH HAS A REPORT ON THE HOUSE OF LORDS LEAVES TOO MANY BEHIND BARONESS TYLER IS THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT MEMBER OF THE LORDS COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL MOBILITY THAT'S PRODUCED THIS REPORT GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING APART FROM
ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS AND OR I SUPPOSE AND APPRENTICESHIP WHAT ELSE SHOULD WE BE ENCOURAGING YOUNGSTERS TO DO
THE SELECT COMMITTEE FELT STRONGLY THAT THERE SHOULD BE A WIDER RANGE OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PARTICULARLY MOTIVATED OR INTERESTED BY BY THE ACADEMIC ROUTE AND WE PARTICULARLY FELT THAT THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO STUDY IN FURTHER EDUCATION COLLEGES WITH A LOT OF INVOLVEMENT FROM EMPLOYERS WITH GOOD WORK PLACEMENT WORK EXPERIENCE YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT APPRENTICESHIPS
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT APPRENTICESHIPS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE SELECT COMMITTEE CERTAINLY VALUES APPRENTICESHIPS AND THINK THEY'RE A GOOD THING WE WERE VERY CLEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE WE RECEIVED THAT THERE'S ONLY ONLY SIX PER CENT OF APPRENTICESHIPS GO TO ARE TAKEN UP BY PEOPLE IN THE SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN AGE GREENWICH ORATORY OF A PRAYER OF APPRENTICES ARE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND OVER AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON IN THIS REPORT IS WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN THE AGES OF FOURTEEN TO NINETEEN AND TRYING TO OPEN UP A WIDER RANGE OF CHOICES
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT BUT I'M IN AT FORTY AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE STILL IN SCHOOL WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE GETTING BETTER CAREERS ADVICE AND SOME SORT OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THE WORLD OF WORK THERE TO ME THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CAMBRIDGE OR SOMETHING BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE SAYING WE ARE SAYING THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE FAR BETTER CAREERS EDUCATION BOTH IN SCHOOLS AND INDEPENDENT CAREERS ADVICE AVAILABLE WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MAKING THEIR CHOICES
BUT ALSO THAT WHAT'S AVAILABLE FROM AGE FOURTEEN ONWARDS SHE REFLECTS THAT INTEREST LOCATION INTERESTS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE IF THEY HAVE ANY IF THEY HAVE ANY AND MUCH MORE I THINK AS YOU SAY EXPOSURE TO EMPLOYERS TO WHAT WORKING LIFE IS LIKE HAVING OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORK TASTERS WORK EXPERIENCE AND REALLY JUST OPENING THEIR EYES TO THE THE RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE AVAILABLE AND CRITICALLY BUILDING IN BETTER SUPPORT
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THE BETTER SUPPORT FRANKLY IS THERE FOR THOSE WHO WERE FOLLOWING THE THE ACADEMIC A LEVELS AND AND GOING ON TO UNIVERSITY AND WE WE JUST FELT THAT THIS MAJORITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE AS WE CALLED THEM WERE FRANKLY GETTING A RAW DEAL AND THE TROUBLE IS AN AWFUL LOT OF THEM JUST AREN'T INTERESTED IT'S CALLED BEING SUPPOSE THEY THEY JUST CAN'T BE BOTHERED THEY JUST THINK WELL SOMETHING'LL TURN UP
I THINK IT'S TRUE THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE DO THINK THAT SOMETHING WILL TURN UP BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S TRUE THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE FRANKLY HAVEN'T BEEN VERY MOTIVATED AT SCHOOL PARTICULARLY IF THEY FEEL THAT THE THOUGHT OF ACADEMIC ROUTE ISN'T REALLY ONE A.M. AND UNLESS THEY HAVE A RANGE OF THINGS IT'S REALLY INTEREST THEN WHICH RUN OFF UNLESS THEY FEEL THAT THEY'RE HIGH QUALITY AND I THINK CRITICALLY WITH MORE EXPOSURE TO EMPLOYERS FROM AN EARLIER AGE AND THE SORT OF SKILLS THAT EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING FOR
ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN TO REALLY IMPROVE THE RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE LARGE LARGE GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON IT WHEN YOU SAY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE LOOKING FOR SKILLS AND THAT'S THE THING IS I MEAN WHAT'S IN IT FOR EMPLOYERS TO TAKE A SORT OF IDEA AT A DISAFFECTED FIFTEEN YEAR OLD WHO CAN'T BE BOTHERED REALLY DO VERY MUCH EMPLOYEES HAVEN'T GOT THE TIME OR THE INCLINATION REALLY TO TALK ABOUT ACTORS' CAREERS CONSULTANTS
NO AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE ASKING EMPLOYERS TO BE CAREERS' CONSULTANT WE ARE SAYING THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF BENEFITS WE THINK BOTH FOR EMPLOYERS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND HAVING MUCH BETTER LINKS BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND EMPLOYERS AND A LOT OF PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT BUT WE RECEIVED A LOT OF EVIDENCE ACTUALLY FROM EMPLOYERS TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND MANY OF THEM SAID
THAT THE CURRENT VERY STRONG FOCUS ON JUST ONE ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS WASN'T GIVING THEM WHAT THEY WANTED IN TERMS OF CHOOSING YOUNG PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT THE RIGHT SORT OF TEAMWORK SKILLS WHO TIME MANAGEMENT YOU COULD WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE SELF MOTIVATED AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF WHAT'S SOMETIMES CALLED LIFE SKILLS OR EMPLOYABILITY STRAWS AND FEELING THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM FRANKLY JUST WASN'T PRODUCING THAT AT THE MOMENT I LIKE TIME MANAGEMENT
WE'RE GOING UP IN THE MORNING THEY'RE UNTIDY CLEVER EITHER THANKS VERY MUCH A PLEASURE IT HAS SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN SOMEONE IS INJURED AND LOSING BLOOD A CAR CRASH PERHAPS OR EVEN SURGERY IT IS VITAL THAT THEY GET AN INFUSION OF BLOOD AND THE BLOOD CLOTS THAT THEY STOP BLEEDING AND THAT'S WHERE PLATELETS COME IN AND WHERE TECHNOLOGY IS ABOUT TO DELIVER
WHAT SEEMS TO BE A REALLY SIGNIFICANT BOOST CEDRIC GAVE ART IS ON THE LINE HIS CONSUMMATE SOUTH AND HAEMATOLOGIST FOR N.H.S. BLOOD AND TRANSPLANT A SENIOR LECTURER AT UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND EXPLAIN TO US WHAT THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT MIGHT MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THIS
WE NOW REACHING THE POINT WHERE WE WERE LOOKING AT PRODUCING PLATELETS TO HELP CLOT BLOOD IN THE LABORATORY SO AT THE MOMENT WE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON BLOOD DONATION TO PRODUCE THOSE PLATELETS FOR AS YOU SAY PATIENT WHO HAD A CAR CRASH OR SURGERY OR INDEED PATIENTS WERE RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY I NEED SUN BLOCK PRODUCTS REPORT
SO WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS A METHODOLOGY TO PRODUCE A LARGE AMOUNT OF THE CLEVELAND MODEL HERSELF THEY CALLED MAKE A CASE SIDE FORMED STEM CELLS AND THEIR METHODOLOGY DUDDY IS POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE TO GENERATING BOOTH PLATELETS FOR PATIENTS POTENTIALLY
POTENTIALLY YES WE ARE STILL YEARS AWAY FROM THE DIFFERING THAT PRODUCT BUT A SIGNIFICANT STEP IS THAT WE'VE NOW FOUND A WAY TO PRODUCE LARGE AMOUNT OF CELLS AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE BOTTLE NECK INDY'S TECHNOLOGY IS THAT PRODUCING LARGE AMARNA WAS REASONABLY
A CHEAP METHOD IS HE'S ALWAYS BEEN QUITE ELUSIVE HUNTER A RECENTLY THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE NOW IDENTIFIED IS HARD TO DO SO I WHICH OPENS DE WAY TO POTENTIALLY DOING TO HIS CLINICAL TRIALS WE HIS PATIENTS IN FOR FIVE YEARS AND THE IDEA THEN IS THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PLATELETS AND THEIR ABILITY TO DO THE JOB THAT THAT PLATELETS DOING CLOTTING BLOOD YOU WOULD BE OF THE HIGHEST ORDER
DOES WORKS DE THEORY YEARS AND SADLY ONE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS THAT WE CAN MODIFY THE STEM CELLS SO THAT THE PLATELETS WE GET OUT OF THEM MIGHT CLOG BETTER PLATELETS WE GET FROM BLOOD DONORS
SO WE CAN MODIFY AND PLATELETS TRIGGERED A PLOTTING EVEN BETTER WE WOULD HAVE HUGE ADVANTAGES FOR PATIENTS WHO'VE HAD A CRASH OR I'M BLEEDING OR EVEN RUTH AND SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN INJURED YEAH COS IT'S NOT JUST THE SUPPLY THEN OF PLATELETS WHICH I WAS IN THE GOOD TO HAVE THIS PLENTIFUL THEY'D BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE SUPPLY BUT ACTUALLY THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIAL ITSELF AT YOUR DINNER WITH AT THEIR ABILITY TO BE GRANULAR TUCKED UP TO STOP THE CLOTTING THAT WILL BE IMPROVED
SUDDENLY HE'S DECAYS AND IT'S ALSO THE CASE STUDY WILL BE EASY TO MATCH THE PLATELETS TO THE PATIENTS SO WHEN WE GIVE A BLOCK PRODUCT TO A GIVEN PATIENT WE HAVE TO MATCH FOR BLOOD GROUP SING MOST PEOPLE HAVE YOU HEARD OF THAT THE RED SAND GROUP A.B. AND PLATELETS HAVE GOT THEIR OWN BLOOD GROUPS
AND WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE ACTUALLY IMMUNISED AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE'S PLATELETS ALL RIGHT I NEED TO FIND A MATCH PLATELETS WHICH IS A DIFFICULT AND EVER SO WE ISSUE FIFTEEN UNITS OF MATCH PLATELETS EVERY YEAR THEY THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS THE RANDOM CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO GO UP WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE BUT YOU'VE SUDDENLY INTRODUCED US TO THE IDEA LET'S HOPE IT HAPPENS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY'RE FROM CAMBRIDGE

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE EIGHTH OF APRIL HEADLINES THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON HAS FACED A FRESH BARRAGE OF CRITICISM AFTER REVEALING THAT HE DID HAVE SHARES IN HIS FATHER'S OFFSHORE INVESTMENT FUND AND MADE THOUSANDS OF POUNDS WHEN HE SOLD THEM
DETECTIVES ARE LOOKING FOR A MISSING POLICE OFFICER IN LONDON HAVE ARRESTED A MAN ON SUSPICION OF MURDER AND DOZENS OF MIGRANTS HAVE LEFT GREECE ON A FERRY HEADING FOR TURKEY IN THE SECOND WAVE OF RETURNS AS PART OF A DEAL WITH THE NEW TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS KATHY CLAXTON LABOURER HAS ACCUSE DAVID CAMERON OF HYPOCRISY AFTER HE REVEALED THAT HE HAD OWN SHARES IN AN OFFSHORE TRUST SET UP BY HIS FATHER WHICH WAS NAMED IN THE PANAMA PAPERS
MISTER CAMERON SAID HE SOLD THE SHARES AND TWENTY TEN BEFORE HE ENTERED DOWNING STREET AND INSISTS HE PAID ALL THE RELEVANT U.K. TAXES
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC OF TAX AVOIDANCE AND LABOUR'S TOM WATSON SAID IT WAS WRONG TO HAVE MADE A ON PEOPLE FOR DOING WHAT HE USED TO DO MORE DETAILS FROM OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON
LABOUR WANT TO MAINTAIN THE PRESSURE ON THE PRIME MINISTER BY CALLING HIM TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT NEXT WEEK BUT HIS FINANCIAL AFFAIRS THE PARTY'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON ACCUSE DAVID CAMERON OF DOUBLE STANDARDS FOR CALLING FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY AND TAX OR FEELING TO REVEAL FOR SIX YEARS BUT IT HELD SHARES AND OVERSEAS TRUST BUT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS INSISTED HE HAS NOTHING TO HIDE
HE REVEALED THAT HE AND HIS WIFE SOLD SHARES WORTH MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS AND CLEAR MORE INVESTMENT FUND SET UP BY HIS LATE FATHER BUT HE'S HOPING THAT HIS INSISTENCE THAT BLAIR WASN'T A VEHICLE FOR AVOIDING TAX AND WAS PROPERLY AUDITED WERE NO CAN SAY IN A WEEK OF BAD HEADLINES TO THE DUSTBIN OF HISTORY MY COME AND POINTED OUT THAT HE HAD PAID TAX ON SHARE DIVIDENDS BUT THERE SIMPLY IS CLAIMING HE'S LOST THE TRUST OF VOTERS
THE PRIME MINISTER NO INTENDS TO HALT THE EROSION OF THAT VALUABLE POLITICAL COMMODITY BY MAKING HIS TAX RETURNS PUBLIC
THERE'S NO SUGGESTION THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL FOR MISTER CAMERON TO BENEFIT FROM AN OFFSHORE TRUST BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER HE WILL SATISFY HIS CRITICS WITH HIS LATEST STATEMENT A DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR JAMES LANDALE CONSIDERS HOW DAMAGING THE REVELATION COULD BE
IN THE LONG RUN THE PRIME MINISTER WILL HOPE TO ACHIEVE HIS AIM OF DRAWING A LINE UNDER THE STORY JOURNALISTS AND OPPOSITION M.P.S WILL NATURALLY KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS BUT THERE ARE UNLIKELY TO BE MORE SIGNIFICANT REVELATIONS IN THE FACT THAT MISTER CAMERON DID INDEED BENEFIT FROM AN OFFSHORE TRUST SOMETHING THAT IS LEGAL BUT OVER WHICH PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS
THE PROBLEM FOR THE PRIME MINISTER IS THAT THE POLITICAL IMAGERY IS NOT GOOD HE IS ENGAGED IN THE POLITICAL FIGHT OF HIS LIFE TRYING TO CONVINCE THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ANYTHING LIKE THIS THAT DISTANCES MY CAMERON FROM THE ELECTORATE THE REMINDS PEOPLE OF HIS WEALTHY AND PRIVILEGED BACKGROUND LET'S JUST SAY THE TIMING ISN'T GREAT
DETECTIVE SEARCHING FOR A MISSING METROPOLITAN POLICE OFFICER FIND HUMAN REMAINS AT A PROPERTY IN LONDON AND ARRESTED THE MAN ON SUSPICION OF MURDER GORDON SAMPLE I CONSTABLE BASED IN WESTMINSTER DISAPPEARED A WEEK AGO POLICE SAY THEY WON'T SPECULATE ON WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED OR IN A CAUSE OF DEATH DANIEL BIRCHER REPORTS

YOU SHAMED HIM AREA BY THE END OF JUNE IF TURKEY FULFILS CONDITIONS
ESTIMATES FROM THREE SEPARATE CLIMATE AND ENERGY EXPERTS SUGGEST THAT TATA STEEL WHICH HAS PUT ITS BRITISH BUSINESS INTERESTS UP FOR SALE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROFITS FROM A POLICY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT THEY'VE CALCULATED THAT TARTAR MADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS SELLING CARBON EMISSIONS PERMITS IT WAS GIVEN FOR FREE UNDER THE E. USE EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME THERE HAVE BEEN CLAIMS THAT Y. YOU CLIMB AT POLICIES HELPED UNDERMINE THE COMPANY HERE'S OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER KARABIN
WHEN THE E.U. FIRST RESOLVED TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE IT DECIDED THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY WAS TO CREATE A SYSTEM FOR FIRMS TO BUY AND SELL PERMITS TO POLLUTE HEAVY INDUSTRIES WERE GIVEN PERMITS FREE OF CHARGE FOR FEAR THAT OTHERWISE THEY'D BE DAMAGED BY GLOBAL COMPETITION
TYPICALLY THOSE FIRMS ASKED FOR MORE POLLUTION PERMITS THAN THEY REALLY NEEDED AND THAT LEFT A SURPLUS TO SELL ON THE CARBON MARKET
THREE ANALYST CONCLUDE THAT IN THE U.K. TATTER WAS THE BIGGEST WINNER MAKING AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IN WIN FOR PROFIT
ALTHOUGH THE FIRM WENT COMMENT OFFICIALLY I UNDERSTAND THAT PRIVATELY THEY'RE SAYING THEY BROKEN NO RULES AND CAN'T BE BLAMED FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM
THE GOVERNMENT HAS RULED OUT HOLDING FRESH TALKS TO END THEIR CONTRACT DISPUTE WITH JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND AS THE LATEST FORTY EIGHT HOUR STRIKE COMES TO AN END A FURTHER WORK OUT AS PLANNED FOR LATER THIS MONTH WHEN FOR THE FIRST TIME DOCTORS WERE ALSO WITHDRAW EMERGENCY COVER
GOVERNMENT SOURCES SAID THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAD BLOWN ITS CHANCE TO NEGOTIATE
IT'S CLAIMED A U.K. EDUCATION SYSTEM IS LETTING DINED SCHOOL LEAVERS WHO DON'T FOLLOW THE TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC ROUTE INTO WORK THE HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL MOBILITY SAYS TEENAGERS WHO DON'T GO TO UNIVERSITY OR DO A. LEVELS OFTEN DRIFT INTO THEIR FIRST JOB WITHOUT THE LIFE SKILLS OR WORK EXPERIENCE THEY NEED
HERE'S OUR EDUCATION EDITOR BREMEN GEOFFREY'S MORE THAN HALF OF ALL YOUNG PEOPLE FIND THEIR WAY INTO WORK WITHOUT GOING TO UNIVERSITY BUT DESPITE BEING THE MAJORITY THEY'VE BEEN FAILED ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT PUPILS FACE A BEWILDERING SYSTEM OF DIFFERENT VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS LESS PUBLIC MONEY IS SPENT ON FUNDING COLLEGE EDUCATION COMPARED TO UNIVERSITY
THIS REPORT SUGGESTS A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON ACADEMIC ROUTES TO ADULTS LIFE RISKS TRAPPING THOSE WHO TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH INTO POORLY PAID WORK THE PEERS HEARD EVIDENCE THAT SCOTLAND HAS RECENTLY COMMITTED TO SPENDING MORE TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE INTO JOBS IN ENGLAND THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S INVESTING IN APPRENTICESHIPS AND WILL EXTEND TUITION FEE LOANS TO THOSE STUDYING AT COLLEGE
POPE FRANCIS WILL TODAY MAKE PUBLIC THE RESULTS OF HIS TWO SIN ODDS ON THEIR FAMILY IN A DOCUMENT EAGERLY AWAITED BY THE WORLD'S ROMAN CATHOLICS
IN WHAT'S KNOWN AS AN APOSTOLIC EXHORTATION THE POPE WILL GIVE HIS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT FAMILY LIFE MARRIAGE CONTRACEPTION AND BRINGING UP CHILDREN ARE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE WYATT REPORTS
FOR THREE YEARS POPE FRANCIS HAS PREPARED THE WAY FOR THIS DOCUMENT ON THEIR FAMILY KNOWN BY ITS LATIN NAME THAT TRANSLATES AS THE JOY OF LOVE FIRST HE SENT A QUESTIONNAIRE TO FAMILIES ACROSS THE WORLD ASKING THEM ABOUT THEIR HOPES AND THEIR FEARS AND THEN HE BROUGHT BISHOPS AND CARDINALS TOGETHER FOR TWO SYNODS IN ROME AT WHICH HE ENCOURAGED THEM TO DEBATE AND EVEN TO DISAGREE OVER ISSUES THAT DIVIDE THE CHURCH IN MANY COUNTRIES
THOSE RANGE FROM OFFERING COMMUNION TO THE DIVORCED AND REMARRIED CONTRACEPTION AND THE TREATMENT OF CATHOLICS WHO ARE GAY WHEN HE DOCUMENT THAT WILL BE RELEASED IN ROME WILL SHOW EXACTLY WHERE POPE FRANCIS STANDS AND SOME ARE ALREADY DESCRIBING IT AS A PAPAL BOMBSHELL AS THE POPE STEPS INTO THE MINEFIELD OF CATHOLIC TEACHING ON THE FAMILY
PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS IN VENEZUELA HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE DAY OFF TODAY AS THE GOVERNMENT BATTLES AND ELECTRICITY CRISIS THEY WILL HAVE LONG WEEKENDS THROUGHOUT APRIL AND MAY BY ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT WOMEN HAVE BEEN URGED NOT TO USE HAIRDRYERS AS PART OF EFFORTS TO CONSERVE POWER
THAT I THINK IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WELL HE GOT THERE IN THE END DAVID CAMERON FINALLY ADMITTED YESTERDAY THAT HE AND HIS WIFE DID BENEFIT FROM SHARES IN AN OFFSHORE TRUST SET UP BY HIS LATE FATHER THE WAY HE EXPLAINED IT ROBERT PESTON SUGGESTED IT WAS A SORT OF THING ANYONE WOULD HAVE DONE AT THE TIME AND THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG IN THAT ARRANGEMENT WELL I'M GOING ON THE LINE BY JAMES CALLED ME WHO IS A SPECIALIST IN TAX PLANNING AT STEVENSON HARWOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JOHN IS HE RIGHT ABOUT THAT
RIGHT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG THE SORT OF THING EVERYBODY'S DOING AT THE TIME I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE U.K. WHO HAVE INVESTED IN SIMILAR FUNDS
SO IF HE'S DONE SOMETHING WRONG THEN SO HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE MILLIONS IT ISN'T THE CASE THAT IT MAY WELL BE BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A PARTICULAR FUND THAT MATE MIGHT HAVE ENGAGED IN SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES YOU WERE INVOLVED IN IT BUT ISN'T THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND SPECIFICALLY INVESTING IN A FUND DESIGNED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OFFSHORE ARRANGEMENTS SORRY JOHN I THINK I THINK THERE'S A MASSIVE MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT HE'S INVESTED IN AND CAN YOU DO ME A BIG FAVOUR OR NOT
EVER USED THE TERM OFFSHORE TRUST AGAIN RELATION TO THIS INVESTMENT I THINK YOU CAN TELL ME WHY BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN OFFSHORE TRUST RIGHT TO BE A GOOD START WOULDN'T IT O.K. SO WHAT IS IT IT'S AN OFFSHORE COMPANY IT'S AN OPEN ENDED INVESTMENT COMPANY
WHICH WAS INCORPORATED IN PANAMA AND IS RESIDENT IN IRELAND RIGHT IN THAT IT THREE IN THAT UNDER TRUST HER TRUST SUGGESTS SOMETHING PRIVATE SOMETHING THAT FAMILIES USED TO HIDE MONEY IT IS NOT A TRUST IT IS A COMPANY IT IS A COMPANY WHICH IS DESIGNED FOR INVESTMENT
NEARLY ALL HEDGE FUNDS ARE ORGANISED AS WEEKS IT'S WHAT WE CALL THEM SURE INVESTMENT NOT NO SORRY OR EXTENDS FOR OPEN ENDED INVESTMENT COMPANY IS BASICALLY A COMPANY THAT ENABLES INVESTORS TO COME IN AND TAKE SHARES OR UNITS AS THEY'RE CALLED RIGHT BUT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHERWISE WHY WOULD THEY BE OFFSHORE UNLESS THERE WAS SOME BELL RIGHT WHY WOULD THEY BE OFFSHORE LIKE MOST MOST HEDGE FUNDS ARE OFFSHORE
O.K. AND THE REASON FOR THAT WERE YOU TOLD ABOUT YOUR TURN ABOUT HEDGE FUNDS THIS WAS A HEDGE FUND RIGHT O.K. BUT AND MOST OF THEM ARE OFFSHORE BUT WE'VE GOT TO THE POINT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT IS WHETHER WHAT HE DID WAS THE SORT OF THING THAT YOUR AVERAGE INVESTED WITH A FEW GRAND WANTED TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OFF IT A BIT OF INVESTMENT MAY BE A BIT OF CAPITAL GAIN WOULD DO MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO HEDGE FUNDS
WELL MOST PEOPLE DO HEDGE FUND YES REALLY YES NEARLY EVERY SINGLE PENSION FUND IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S NO IT'S IGNORANT WELL OF COURSE IT IS YOU HAVE A HEAD YOU ARE INVOLVED IN AND INVEST IN A PENSION FUND BECAUSE
YOUR EMPLOYER OR WHATEVER IT IS PUTS MONEY INTO INVESTING IN A PENSION FUND I DISAGREE YOU DON'T CONTROL THAT IN ANY SENSE AT ALL WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU IN YOUR PENSION FUND WHICH COULD INCLUDE A PERSONAL PENSION YOU PUTTIN MONEY YOURSELF IT'S SELECTS A CHORE
A RANGE OF INVESTMENTS WHICH WILL INCLUDE HEDGE FUNDS AND THOSE HEDGE FUNDS HAVE ALWAYS RUN OFF SHORE AND THEY RUN OFF SHORE BECAUSE THE OFFSHORE CENTRES PROVIDE A FAR MORE BUSINESS FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT FOR THOSE FUNDS RIGHT AND THAT'S THE THING YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THIS IS A BUSINESS DECISION BY THE PEOPLE THAT SET UP THE FUND TO USE THEIR JURISDICTION IN QUESTION AND THIS IS ESSENTIALLY AN IRISH RESIDENT COMPANY
ALL RIGHT BUT I THINK RECITE CROSS PURPOSES HERE WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT PEOPLE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY WHO WAS INVOLVED IN A PENSION FUND PUTTING STONES
HE'S INVOLVED IN THESE THINGS KNOWINGLY WHAT I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU IS THAT THEY ARE NOT KNOWINGLY INVOLVED THEY MAY WELL BE A PART OF IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE PENSION FUND OPERATES BUT THEY HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION LEAPT I WILL INVEST IN THIS OFFSHORE COMPANY THEY HAVEN'T MADE THAT DECISION IS WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU MOST
WITH RESPECT MOST PEOPLE TO INVEST MONEY WILL KNOW THAT THE INVESTMENTS WERE OFFSHORE NOW I AGREE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF ORDINARY INVESTORS WHO DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEIR PENSION FUNDS HAVE DONE WITH THE MONEY I'M SO LESLEY BUT YOU'RE AT IT THERE'S NOT REALLY THE POINT THOUGH IS IT IT'S EXACTLY THE POINT NO IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE THE FUNDS DON'T REALLY AVOID ANY TAX AND WHAT EVERYONE'S MISSING ON THIS IS THAT
THIS IS A DISTRIBUTOR FUND SO EVERY PENNY OF PROFIT IS PAID OUT TO THE INVESTORS SO IF IF THE FOREIGN DID DEDUCT ATTACKS AT FRONT LEVEL FOR EVERY POUND DEDUCTED AT FUN LEVEL
THAT'S ONE POINT LESS RECEIVED BY THE INVESTOR THAT'S ONE POINT LES THAT GOES ON THE TAX RETURN AND THAT'S FORTY P. LESS GOING TO THE EXCHEQUER
RIGHT NO I UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT BUT THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE AND IT'S THE POINT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE PICKING UP BECAUSE THEY'RE ACCUSING THE PRIME MINISTER OF HYPOCRISY AND I'M TRYING TO NAIL THIS REALLY O.K. IT'S IT'S WHETHER WHEN SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING WHEN SOMEBODY MAKES AN INVESTMENT
THEY IF THEY KNOWINGLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN INVESTMENT THAT MY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HOLD SOME TAX BENEFITS FOR THEM THAT IS ONE THING IF THEY WERE INVOLVED IN A PENSION FUND THAT MAKES ALL SORTS OF INVESTMENTS IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN
I THINK WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT HEDGE FUNDS INVESTMENT FUNDS GENERALLY IS THAT MOST OF THEM ARE REALLY RUBBISH WAYS OF AVOIDING TAX IF I WANTED TO AVOID TAX I WOULD NOT PUT MY MONEY
INTO A HEDGE FUND ON THE DISTRIBUTOR STATUS WHICH THIS WAS SITUATED ANYWHERE BECAUSE ALL THE PROPHETS HAVE PAID OUT EVERY YEAR AND IT GOES ON MY TAX RETURN THERE IS NO ELEMENT OF DEFERRAL OF TAX YOU'LL GET MORE DEFERRAL OF TAX INVESTING IN A U.K. COMPANY SO THIS IS YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE CHOOSE THESE FATHERS BECAUSE OF THE EXCELLENCE OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING THEM
AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE IN THE PORTFOLIOS NOT BECAUSE HE'S ON THE HAND THERE'S NOTHING THIS IS ABOUT AS BORING AS IT GETS FOR INVESTMENTS IS NO DIFFERENT FROM MY CAMERON INVESTING IN A U.K. STOP
ALL RIGHT WE HAVE TO END IT THERE THANKS VERY MUCH A JAMES CORBETT IT IS QUARTER PAST SEVEN TATA STEEL COMPLAINED THAT ENERGY COSTS HIGHER ENERGY COSTS IN THE U.K. WELL ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY COULDN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY ONE OF THE REASONS IT SEEMS WIPE AT ALL BUT HE'S HAVING TO BE SOLD BY THE COMPANY'S BEING ACCUSE THIS MORNING ARE MAKING QUITE A WINDFALL PROFIT OFF THE BACKS OF EUROPEAN UNION TAXPAYERS BY SELLING CARBON EMISSION PERMITS
KIRK DE JONG IS ON THE LINE WHO IS E.U. POLICY DIRECTOR AT CARBON MARKET WATCH WHICH IS A PRESSURE GROUP GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT TARTAR OF DARK
I'M NOT GOING TO JUST SING THAT UDDER HAS DONE ANYTHING WHAT WE ARE SEEING ARE ABOUT ACTUALLY WE HAVE COMMISSIONED A STUDY AND IT WAS DONE BY AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANCY SEE DELVED AND THIS STUDY SHOWS STUDS IT CARBON INTENSIVE INDUSTRY ACROSS EUROPE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY PROFITED FROM EUROPE'S CLIMATE POLICY SPECIFICALLY EUROPE'S CARBON MARKETS SO IN THE U.K. THE BIGGEST EARNER FROM THIS CARBON MIKE WERE STUD
AND BY PARTICIPATING IN EUROPE SCARRAN MY GOODS AT A STEEL ACCORDING TO A STUDY ESTIMATE EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION YEAR OLD PROFITS BETWEEN THE YEARS TWO DOESN'T AID UNTIL HASN'T FOURTEEN DESIS ABOUT'S OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS AND THAT IS A PROFIT THAT THEY HAVE MADE THROUGH THE PERFECTLY LEGAL PRACTICE OF SELLING ON THEIR EMISSIONS RIGHT
YEAH SO BASICALLY DE RECEIVE FREE BUT LUCIAN RIGHTS FREE CARBON PERMITS BUT THEY HAVE RECEIVED MORE FREE CARBON BURMA STAND IT ACTUALLY NEED A TOOK OFFERED OUR MISSIONS ARE REMAINING FREE BURMA THEY COULD SELL FOR A PROFIT IN THERE MIKE HER TS AND DOES IT CANCEL OUT DO YOU THINK THE EXTRA PRICE THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY BECAUSE ELECTRICITY SO EXPENSIVE IN THIS COUNTRY MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TWO TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THE E.U. AVERAGE
ON THAT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO OR TO AND I JUST THINK OF IT IS CLEAR THAT IT'S AN INTERESTING ONE THOUGH ISN'T IT BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE HEARD IT MAY HAVE HAD AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT THIS IN RECENT TIMES IS THAT PARTICULARLY FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES IN BRITAIN
THE COST THAT THEY HAVE IN ELECTRICITY A HUGE AND THEY'VE COMPLAINED ABOUT IT AND IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY'VE DONE BADLY WE LOST QUITE A LOT OF OUR ALUMINIUM INDUSTRY A FEW YEARS AGO FOR THAT REASON AND YET NOW WHAT YOU SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING IS IN FACT THEY
THEY BENEFIT AS WELL FROM THE CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES AT A EUROPEAN LEVEL AND THAT POSSIBLY ONE CANCELS OUT THE OTHER
POSSIBLY YES I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT'S FOR SURE THAT THAT IS INDEED POSSIBLE AND I THINK IT'S ALSO GOOD TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HIGH ELECTRICITY PROCESS AND THE REASON WHERE ELECTRICITY PRICES AS HER A HIGH
AND I THINK WHAT LET THE STUDY THAT THE DONE SHOWS IS THAT'S YOUR SCARMAN MY GET YOUR SLIME OF POLICIES THEY HAVE NOT BEEN A COSTS OPERATIONS OF COMPANIES LIKE THAT AND GONE FOR US IT HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF PROFIT SO THAT'S QUITE A CLAIM WHICH ISN'T IT THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD
YES I THINK THERE ARE SOME CLAIMS SOMETIMES MADE AROUND EUROPE'S CUT CARBON MARKETS AND YOUR SLIME OF POLICIES THAT WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT THEM THEY DON'T THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE SUBSTANTIATED BY ANY EFFECTS OH KAY HAD BEGUN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
TWENTY NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN FOR YEARS THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED THAT PRODUCTIVITY IS ONE OF THIS COUNTRY'S GREAT PROBLEM AS WELL THE CHANCELLOR HAS NOW DESCRIBED IT AS
HE DESCRIBED AS THE BUT IN THE PAST AS THE CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME BUT THE LATEST FIGURES SHOW THEY'RE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE INDEED WE ARE SLIPPING BACKWARDS TURN YEAH THAT'S THE WORRYING NEWS JOHN GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE BIGGEST DROP AND PRODUCTIVITY SO IT SEEMS SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OFFICIAL FIGURES WHICH CAME OUT YESTERDAY SHOW THAT LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY WHICH IS MEASURED BY OUTPUT
OUR FELL ONE POINT TWO PER CENT OF THIS IS THE FOURTH QUARTER OF LAST YEAR FROM THE THIRD QUARTER THE QUESTION IS OF COURSE WHY JOHN VAN RYMAN ASSERT DIRECTOR OF THE L.S.E. CENTRE FOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE HE'S WITH ME NOW IN THE STUDIO WHAT'S GOING WRONG JOHN
WELL ON A NARROW BASIS AS YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED THE LAST QUARTER OF OF LAST YEAR IT WAS REALLY BAD LET'S ONLY ONE COURT FOR SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME OVER THE YEAR THE INCREASES ABOUT ONE PER CENT THAT WASN'T SO BAD BUT IN THE GLOBAL SCHEME OF THINGS IT IS PRETTY TERRIBLE BECAUSE NORMALLY THE EXPERIENCE WE HAD FOR THE THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT PRODUCTIVITY IS GOING UP BY ABOUT TWO POINT TWO PERCENT
AND SINCE THE BIG FALL OF PRODUCTIVITY THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WE HAVEN'T REALLY RECOVERED SO WE'VE BEEN IT'S THE PRODUCTIVITY HAS BEEN KIND OF PRETTY MUCH FLAT AS A PANCAKE OR MAYBE INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE PER CENT RIGHT CAN WE RELY ON THESE FIGURES GIVEN THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO AN ECONOMY WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY SERVICES ECONOMY THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION AND SECOND OF ALL WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT
WELL THERE'S DEFINITELY BEEN MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS SO THAT AS YOU SAY AS AS WE GET INTO SERVICES WERE OUTPUT AS MUCH HARDER TO MEASURE WE'RE PROBABLY NOT CAPTURING SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF IMPROVEMENTS AND THINGS LIKE FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE WHICH WE HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING FOR BUT IT'S HARD PEOPLE HAVE RE LOOK AT THIS IN DETAIL IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT'S THE WHOLE EXPLANATION FOR WHY PRODUCTIVITY HAS BEEN SO PAUL SINCE TWO THOUSAND IT WASN'T SUDDENLY AS IF MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS GOT WHERE YOU WORSE
DURING A GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS SO I THINK ALTHOUGH MEASUREMENT AS PART OF IT IT'S NOT REALLY THE BIG THE BIG STORY RIGHT AS DON'T COULD CLEARLY THERE IS A MOVE FOR PEOPLE TO BE PAID MORE BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A LACK OF WAGE INFLATION IS THAT GOING TO HELP THE PROBLEM OR EXACERBATE AT WELL I THINK THAT THE OPTIMISTIC STORIES LIFT BYE
WADERS CAN BE PUSHED UP THE NATIONAL THEN YOU CAN EXPECT MORE THAN IT COULD FORCE EMPLOYERS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY BUT I THINK BECAUSE THE INCREASE OF LIVING WAGE WAS SO LARGE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT HE'S GOING TO BE INCREASE SUFFICIENTLY TO COVER THAT SO I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AS EMPLOYERS WILL STARTS A SUBSTITUTE AWAY FROM PEOPLE INTO USING CAPITAL EQUIPMENT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO MEAN THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE UNEMPLOYED AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD WAY OF INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY JOINED I MEAN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU TANYA TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN SHOULD PEOPLE BE ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS USING INTERNET BASED TECHNOLOGY OR SIMPLE PHONE LINES THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE INCLUDING THE POLICE OR THE SECURITY SERVICES TO ACCESS OR SHOULD THE TECH COMPANIES BEFORE FORCED TO KEEP THEIR KIT ACCESSIBLE AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT TO BEING SNOOPED ON WHAT SAP CAUSED A STIR THIS WEEK WHEN THEY SAID THEY WERE OFFERING END TO END ENCRYPTION
I WOULD STILL ALLOW SOPHISTICATED SNOOPERS TO GET ACCESS TO THE ACTUAL DEVICE IS BEING USED NOW COMPANY CALLED FISK IS GOING FURTHER CLAIMING THAT THEY CAN PREVENT THE CAMERA AND THE MICROPHONE ON THE DEVICE FROM BEING HACKED TOTAL SECURITY
WE BROUGHT TOGETHER PROFESSOR ANTHONY POLICE WHO RUNS BUCKINGHAM UNIVERSITY CENTRE FOR SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE STUDIES AND VICTOR COCKIER WHOSE FISK'S SEE WHAT OUR DEVICE DOES IS ACTUALLY DELIVER TRUE
SECURITY UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF PRODUCTS THERE PURPORT TO PROTECT YOUR PHONE AND DON'T WHERE THEY DO SO BECAUSE THEY CAN BE CERTAIN THAT IT WHEN YOU PUT SOFTWARE ALONE ON YOUR FARM YOU'RE NOT REALLY PROTECTING THE M. POINTS WERE TRYING TO MAKE IN THE CAMP
SO WHAT DOES THIS DO THAT THEY DON'T SO WHAT WE DO IS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CASE THERE GOES ON YOUR PHONE THAT LOOKS LIKE AN INNOCUOUS BATTERY CASE THAT ACTUALLY HAS ITS OWN CLASS SISTER ON AUDIO PROCESSOR SPEAKER MICROPHONE
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO MECHANICAL DEVICES OR TAKE PRESSURE WAVES ARE AIR AND GEM THE FONZ NEED OF MICROPHONES SO THAT MEANS OF SUMMER HAS CAPTURED YOUR PHONE INTERNS ON YOUR MICROPHONE AND TAKE YOUR CAMERA THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO HEAR ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE WHERE YOUR ACT IT'S AN INCREDIBLE TOUR TO PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE PROFESSOR GLEESON INCREDIBLE TOOL TO PROTECT PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE
IF THIS IS A DEVICE THAT DOES WHAT WE'RE TOLD IT DOES IT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE THAT IT SHOULD BE ON THE MARKET IT'S CLAIMED THAT IT WILL PROTECT PEOPLE ACTUALLY IT WON'T PROTECT PEOPLE IT WILL DO THE OPPOSITE BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE NO FORM OF COMMUNICATION THAT CANNOT BE LAWFULLY
INTERCEPTED NO FORM OF COMMUNICATION AND THAT INCLUDES A EDGE AGE PICNIC O.K. WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE BECAUSE I KNOW FOR INSTANCE THIS PHONE IS IN USE TO PROTECT POLICE TO PROTECT MILITARY WHO ARE ACTUALLY FIGHTING AGAINST TERRORISTS AND CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD TO PROTECT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO ATTACK
THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT WAS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR USE BY PEOPLE FOR THE GOOD BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY OUR ENEMIES ARE ABLE TO ALWAYS HAVE ONE STEP AHEAD OF US THE BAD GUY IS NEVER NEVER BEHIND POLICE THE PEPTIDES ALWAYS AHEAD OF THE PLANT IS THE BAD GUY WILL BE ABLE TO USE YOUR KIT WERE SELLING TO GOVERNMENTS WERE SIGNED TO BUSINESS BUT IT O.K. BACK TO OTHER PEOPLE AND IF THAT'S THE CASE
GUYS USE REGULAR FRANCE AND THEY DON'T GET CAUGHT THEY PERPETRATE ACTS I BAD GUYS USE MALE TO TRANSMIT THEIR PLANES AND IN THE GREAT PROFESSOR CLEESE WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DAMAGE COULD BE THAT IS THAT I THINK I GET THE DAMAGE COULD BE ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE GONE WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS IRRESPONSIBLE AMERICAN SALES TALK THE FACT IS THAT INTELLIGENCE SUCCESSES REALLY FROM THE SECOND WORLD WAR FROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO JUST A FEW DAYS AGO
RELY INCREASINGLY ON THE ABILITY TO INTERCEPT COMMUNICATIONS AND HERE IS A DEVICE WHICH IN THE WRONG HANDS COULD ALLOW TERRORISM TO FLOURISH DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE BANNED THEM THOUGH DOES IT EXACTLY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS SERVED IN THE ARMY WHO HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS WHEN WE DESIGNED THIS PRODUCT WHEN WE INVENTED THIS PART
IT WAS ACTUALLY TWO TO PROTECT OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE FIELD THOSE THOSE ELEMENTS WHO GET WHO SOMEHOW COULD GET A HOLD OF THIS THE GOVERNOR COMES TO US AND TOLD US HEY THIS PERSON JOE OR JOHN DEALT WAS A BAD PERSON SHUT OFF THEIR SERVICE THEY WERE NOW NO LONGER ABLE TO COMMUNICATE
INCREDIBLY THERE ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE PRIVATELY ANYMORE SO SO THE GOVERNMENT IS BACK GETS DAD US QUO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AN I ISN'T THAT THE POINT ACTUALLY PROFESSOR CLAES THAT REALLY I MEAN IT OF COURSE EVENTUALLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
THIS MAY BE MISUSED AND THERE MAY BE AWFUL CONSEQUENCES BUT THE FREEDOM OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD BY THE GOVERNMENT IN AN AREA WHERE DATA IS SHARED AND LEAKED AND WE'RE ALL TERRIBLY AWARE OF THAT AND PRIVACY IS DESTROYED AND ACTUALLY IS QUITE IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AS IMPORTANT AS THE TERRORISM SIDE OF THE EQUATION
WELL IT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE THEIR PRIVACY OF COURSE BARED THEIR PRIVACY IS MOSTLY UNDERMINED BY BIG AMERICAN COMPANIES WHO USE THEIR DATA AND THERE'S NEVER ANY COMPLAINT MADE ABOUT THEM BUT IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE THIS IS A DEVICE WHICH IF IT WORKS
WILL ALLOW TERRORIST TO COMMUNICATE WITHOUT THEIR COMMUNICATIONS BEING INTERCEPTED AND WE HAVE ALWAYS ALLOWED OUR SECURITY COMMUNITY TO INTERCEPT A COMMUNICATIONS LAWFULLY WHETHER THEIR LETTERS WHETHER THEIR TELEPHONE CALLS
OR WHAT HAVE YOU THIS IS A NEW FORM OF COMMUNICATION AND IT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME SORT OF INTERCEPTION WHO LIVE IN THEIR VERY DIGITAL AGE NOW WHERE TRUST AS A KEY THEN WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TRUST OUR DEVICES IN IF WE THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY WILLING TO GIVE UP SOME LEVEL OF PRIVACY FOR THIS PROTECTION THEN I SAY LET'S WALK DOWN THE STREET AND ASK SOMEONE WHO'S A STRANGER
TO GIVE US THEIR FOUR SIX OR EIGHT DIGIT CODE THERE I THOUGHT ON AND LET US LOOK THROUGH IT MY GUESS IS THAT THEY WON'T WANT THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY FACED WITH THE FACT THAT CREATING THESE BACK DOORS CREATES AVENUES FOR BAD GUYS TO COME AND EXPLOIT IT PROFESSOR ANTHONY CLEESE AND VICTOR QUE O.K. AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH

ESTIMATES FROM THREE SEPARATE CLIMATE AND ENERGY EXPERTS SUGGEST THAT TATA STEEL WHICH HAS PUT US BRITISH BUSINESS INTERESTS UP FOR SALE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROFITS FOR OUR POLICY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT THEY'VE CALCULATED THE TAT ER MADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS SELLING CARBON EMISSIONS PERMITS IT WAS GIVEN FOR FREE UNDER THE E. USE EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME
THE GOVERNMENT HAS RULED OUT HOLDING FRESH TALKS TO END ITS DISPUTE WITH JUNIOR DOCTORS AND ENGLAND AS THE LATEST FORTY EIGHT HOUR STRIKE COMES TO AN END DOCTORS WILL WITHDRAW EMERGENCY COVER IN THE NEXT WALK OUT LATER THIS MONTH IT'S CLAIMED THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS LETTING DION SCHOOL LEAVERS WHO DON'T GO TO UNIVERSITY OR HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE WANT STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE AT FOURTEEN WHETHER TO PURSUE OF OCCASIONAL OR ACADEMIC PATH INTO WORK
FRANCIS WILL TODAY MAKE PUBLIC THE RESULTS OF HIS TWO SIN ODDS ON THEIR FAMILY IN A DOCUMENT EAGERLY AWAITED BY THE WORLD'S ROMAN CATHOLICS IN WHAT'S KNOWN AS AN APOSTOLIC EXHORTATION THE POPE WILL GIVE HIS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT FAMILY LIFE MARRIAGE CONTRACEPTION AND BRINGING UP CHILDREN
THIRTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT TWO TEENAGE GIRLS WILL START A LIFE SENTENCE IN PRISON TODAY A MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN EUROS EACH FOR THE HORRIFIC TORTURE AND MURDER OF A VULNERABLE WOMAN THEY WERE AGED THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN AT THE TIME AT THE MURDERER WHAT EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHO NEEDS TO KNOW PERHAPS
IS WHY THEY DID IT WE KNOW THEY HAD APPALLING CHILDHOODS BUT SO SADLY TO SO MANY CHILDREN SO WHY DID THEY TURN OUT TO BE COLOURS WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM IT WILL I'M JOINED BY BLAKE MORRISON WHO'S A WRITER HE WAS AT THE BULGER MURDER TRIAL MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO AND WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT AND PROFESSOR DAVID CANTOR WHO IS A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST HE'S DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR INVESTIGATED PSYCHOLOGY PSYCHOLOGY
HUDDERSFIELD UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR CANTOR ONE OF THE DEFENDING Q.C.S TOLD THE TRIAL TOOK TOLD THE JUDGE THAT THE JURY THAT THE OLDER GIRL LACKED INTELLIGENCE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE COULD DIE AND ONLY NOW UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACTION CAN A CHILD OF THAT AGE
REALLY NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE WAY A PERSON CAN DIE WELL I THINK IT'S MORE THAN THAT
SHE WAS FAILED BY SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE BACKGROUND THAT SHE'S SAW THE WORLD IN A VERY ABUSIVE WHERE HE SHOULD NEVER REALLY BEEN TREATED PROPERLY AS HIM AND BEING HERSELF AND SOULS HAD NO REAL EMPATHY FOR OTHERS
REAL CONTACT WITH BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN A VIOLENT WAY BUT SADLY AS I SAY IT QUITE HORRIBLY LARGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN HAVE THAT SORT OF UPBRINGING ON THEY DON'T END UP AS MURDERS I MEAN I'M TRYING TO GET IT WHY IT MIGHT BE THAT ONE CHILD GOES IN ONE DIRECTION AND THE OTHER IN ANOTHER THEY FOUND A VULNERABLE VICTIM THAT WOULD ENABLE THEM
TO FEEL SOME SORT OF POWER TO GET SOME DELIGHT UNFORTUNATELY FROM ABUSING A PERSON WHO IS EVEN MORE VULNERABLE THAN THEMSELVES AND I THINK THAT WAS THE SITUATION WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ALSO ABOUT HOW THE VICTIM WAS LEFT SO OPEN TO THIS SORT OF ABUSE AND I THINK THAT'S READY IT'S THAT SITUATION THAT UNFOLDING SITUATION OR BETWEEN THESE GIRLS WHO REALLY
HAD ABSENT ABUSIVE PARENTING PROBABLY CAME TO RANDOM UNSETTLE CARE HOMES NEVER HAD ANY SORT OF PROPER SCHOOLING THEY WERE USING THE POLICE AS A SORT OF TAXI SERVICE SO THAT WHEN THEY CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THIS VICTIM WHO'S EIGHT
COULD GET SOME SORT OF FEELING OF SIGNIFICANCE FROM ABUSING THEM THEY WOULD CARRY ON DOING THAT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S AS CERTAIN STANCES OF THE SITUATION I'M NOT OF THE END PRODUCT WHICH INFORMED CERTAINLY WAS TO KILL THIS BLAKE MORRISON YOU BECOME AN EXPERT ON WHAT HAPPENED THAT DREADFUL CASE OF JAMES BULGER A LITTLE BOY WHO WAS MURDERED BY AND THEY WERE YOUNGER HE'S HIS KILLERS THEY WERE TEN AND ELEVEN I THINK THERE WERE TEN YES
THERE ARE OBVIOUS PARALLELS WE'VE GOT TWO CHILDREN WE'VE GOT TO DEFENCELESS VICTIM AND WE'VE GOT CHILDREN WHO EGG EACH OTHER ON AND COMMIT A CRIME THAT PROBABLY INDIVIDUALLY THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF AND YOU'VE ALSO GOT THOSE AS WELL AS ALL THE FACTORS THAT THEY'VE COUNTRIES MENTIONED THIS IMMEDIATE TRIGGER THAT ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER THE OLDER GIRL THE ONE WITH A LOW I.Q. HAD BEEN TO SEE HER MOTHER
AND THE MOTHER HAD GIVEN HER SOME CIDER AND SOME PILLS AND TOLD US KILL HERSELF SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THEIR ANGER BURNING INSIDE THAT GIRL THAT DAY AND UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS VISITED ON THIS DEFENCE WAS VICTIM LATER IN THE DAY BUT AGAIN WE COME BACK TO THIS QUESTION OF WHY THEY DID THAT TERRIBLE THING THAT THEY DID WHY DID THEY NOT SIMPLY DO WHAT MANY OTHERS WOULD HAVE DONE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES HORRIBLE LIVES THOUGH THEY WERE AND SO ON WHY DID THIS PARTICULAR THING HAPPENED TO THEM
WE'VE GOT THE FACTORY OF OF DRINKS HER A DRINK AND DRUGS HAVEN'T WE AND WE'VE GOT NOWADAYS OF COURSE ARE VERY UNDERFUNDED CARE SYSTEM I MEAN THEY SEEM TO HAVE ENORMOUS FREEDOM TO WANDER AROUND ALL TIMES A DAY AND NIGHT CLEARLY WHEN CHILDREN ARE PLACED IN CARE THE STATE IS SUPPOSED TO BECOME THE PARENT THE GOOD PARENTING SUPPOSED TO COME FROM THE STATE THAT WASN'T HAPPENED THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THIS CASE AT ALL AND IN THE CASE OF JAMES BULGER AS KILLERS
WELL THERE THERE THEIR BACKGROUNDS WERE EQUALLY DAMAGED THEY TOO HAD A SORT OF FREEDOM THROUGH TRUANTING HAS TEN YEAR OLDS TO IT TO END UP COMMITTING THE CRIME THE CRIME THEY COMMITTED THEIR SENTENCE INCIDENTALLY HE WAS IF YOU REMEMBER
ARE RAISED BY MICHAEL HOWARD FROM THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE OF EIGHT YEARS TO FIFTEEN YEARS AND THEN OVERTURNED IN THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS SO THERE'S NO QUESTION OF WHAT AN APPROPRIATE SENTENCE IN THE CASE OF CHILDREN WE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY I THINK RATHER MORE PUNITIVE THAN MOST OF EUROPE
IS THAT AN ARGUMENT THAT THE WELL OBVIOUSLY THEY HAD TO GO TO JAIL DIDN'T THEY BUT IS IT POSSIBLE TO ARGUE THAT PERHAPS THIS IS ONE FOR YOU PROFESSOR CANTOR THAT THE GIRLS SIMPLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTION IN SOME COUNTRIES THEREFORE THEY WOULD NOT BE HELD CRIMINAL RESPONSIBLE CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE
YES THERE ARE HUGE VARIATIONS ACROSS THE WORLD IN THE AGE OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BRITAIN IS QUITE PUNITIVE IN THIS REGARD A BIT DID THAT THIS SITUATION IS THAT THE STATE FAILED THESE GIRLS AND NOW THE TAXPAYER HAS TO PAY TO LOOK AFTER THEM FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS AND IRONICALLY IT COULD WELL BE THAT PRISON IS THE FIRST PLACE WHERE THERE ARE CLEAR RULES AND SOMEONE CONCERNED WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF EVERY DAY AND THAT THEY MAY ACTUALLY TWO QUITE WELL IN PRISON
YOU SAY YOU'RE BOTH SAYING IN EFFECT THE STATE FAILED THE GIRLS AND THAT THAT THAT MANY PEOPLE WILL AGREE WITH THAT BUT
CAN WE NOT SAY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ONE OR BOTH OF THEM PERHAPS ONE LEAD THE OTHERS YOU SAID SOME PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY ARE CHILDREN ARE SIMPLY
BUT THEY DO BAD THINGS THEY ARE BAD AT THIS STAGE BUT HOW DO THEY GET TO BE BAD PEOPLE AREN'T BORN BAD DO WE KNOW THAT YES FOR SURE THAT THE PEOPLE LEARN TO BE HUMAN I THROUGH THEIR EXPERIENCES AND UPBRINGING IF THEY'RE TREATED INHUMAN
THEY BECOME MORE BRUTALISE THEMSELVES THIS IS NOK TO CONDONE OR EXCUSE HER TERRIBLE ACTIONS BUT THEY WERE BRUTALISED BY THEIR EXPERIENCES BUT MORRISON THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE AS WELL WITH THE BULGER KILLERS
AFTER A TERRIBLE CRIME LIKE THIS THAT PEOPLE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO THINK OF REHABILITATION BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HOPE THAT THESE TWO ARE GOING TO LOSE ALL THEIR TEENAGE YEARS ALL THE TWENTIES THAT IN FIFTEEN YEARS' TIME BECAUSE OF THE INPUT THE THERAPEUTIC IN BUT WE HOPE THEY WILL GET INSIDE THAT THEY WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO COME OUT AND BE THE CITIZENS AND ATONE FOR WHAT THEY DID
BLAKE MORRISON AND DAVID CANTER THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THE TIME'S NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LOOK AT THE PAPERS NOW MOST OF THE FRONT PAGES FEATURING THE PRIME MINISTERS AND REVELATION THAT HE PROFITED FROM THE SALE OF SHARES IN AN OFFSHORE FUND SET UP BY HIS LATE FATHER THE FINANCIAL TIMES CALLS THE DISCLOSURE AN AWKWARD MOMENT FOR MISTER CAMERON WHICH FOLLOWS DAYS OF SEMI DENIALS AND ARTFULLY CRAFTED STATEMENT IT SAYS HE'S SLOWLY EVOLVING RESPONSE TO THE PANAMA PAPERS
LABOUR CLAIMED THAT HE HAD SOMETHING TO HIDE THE EYES HAS DOWNING STREET BROKE THE SPIN DOCTORS FIRST RULE GET ALL THE FACTS OUT QUICKLY AND THE PRIME MINISTER HAS NOW PAID A HEAVY PRICE PATRICK KID IN THE TIMES SAYS MY CAMERA LOOK TIRED AS HE ATTEMPTED TO DRAW A LINE UNDER CONCERNS ABOUT HIS FATHER'S FINANCES US THIS WAS NOT HOW HE PLANS TO MARK THE RETURN FROM THE BRIEFEST OF EASTER RECESSES HE WRITES THOSE BEERS IN LANZAROTE SEEM LIKE A LONG TIME AGO
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF ANGER IN THE PAPERS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN TO DISTRIBUTE LEAFLETS AT PUBLIC EXPENSE OUTLINING ARGUMENTS FOR REMAINING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ASCENDED BACKERS JUNK MAIL THAT IS THE ADVICE IN THE SUN WHICH ONCE VOTERS TO BOMBARD MISTER CAMERON WITH UNWANTED PRUE Y. YOU LEAFLETS THE TELEGRAPH SAYS ANGRY TORY EURO SCEPTICS ARE PLANNING REPRISALS WITH ONE UNNAMED M. P. SUGGESTING THERE MAY BE ORGANISED REBELLIONS TO GRIND THE GOVERNMENT TO A HALT
THE F. T. SAYS THE LEAFLET IS CLOSER TO BEING TRUE AND FAIR THAN MATERIAL PRODUCED BY SOME WRECKS IT CAMPAIGNERS BUT THE EXPRESS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF PUMPING OUT PREPOSTEROUS NONSENSE THE TIME SAYS FRENCH PLANS TO BUILD AN EIGHTEEN BILLION POUND NUCLEAR REACTOR AT HINKLEY POINT IN SOMERSET HAD BEEN THROWN INTO FURTHER DOUBT IT SAYS THE FRENCH ENERGY MINISTER CYCLING HAS RAISED CONCERNS
OVER THE COST AND SUGGESTED THAT A FINAL DECISION ON THE PROJECT SHOULD BE DELAYED FINAL APPROVAL HAD BEEN EXPECTED AT A BOARD MEETING NEXT MONTH OF THE FRENCH ENERGY COMPANY BEHIND THE PROJECT
MIXED REACTION TO THE NEWS THAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CO OP GROUP AT RICHARD PENNY COOK HAS ASKED FOR A SIXTY PERCENT PAY CUT BECAUSE HIS JOB HAS BECOME EASIER NOW THAT HE'S MANAGED TO TURN THE COMPANY AROUND HIS SALARY WILL DROP TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IT WAS WELL OVER A MILLION THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS HAS TOLD THE MIRROR MISTER PENNY COOKS ATTITUDE IS REFRESHING BUT THE GUARDIAN SAYS IT HAS ESTABLISHED THAT WHAT HE CALLS A MUCH TRUMPETED CHANGE WON'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL NEXT YEAR
MY PENNY COOK STILL ON COURSE FOR REWARDS TOTALLING MORE THAN THREE MILLION POUNDS BEFORE THEN THE DAILY MAIL AGAIN HIGHLIGHTS THE CASE OF A CELEBRITY IS SAID TO BE INVOLVED IN A SEX SCANDAL WHOSE IDENTITY HAS BEEN PROTECTED BY THE COURTS IN THIS COUNTRY REPRINTS ARE HEAVILY REDACTED VERSION OF AN ARTICLE WHICH WOULD BE PUBLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES
WELL OF COURSE THE COURT'S RULING DOESN'T APPLY THE SON SAYS ONLY IN BRITAIN WOULD BE TOLERATE THE RICH GAGGING THE FREE PRESS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SAYS THE FORMER LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M.P. JOHN HEMMING YOU PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED THE FOOTBALLER RYAN GIGGS IN A PREVIOUS CASE IS CALLING ON PARLIAMENT TO LOOK AGAIN AT THE LAW ON AND JUNCTIONS IS QUOTED AS SAYING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD BACK THE TIDE OF INTERNET INFORMATION LIKE SOME KIND OF DIGITAL KING CANUTE
IT'S NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT KELLOGG'S IS WORRIED THE AMERICAN FOOD GIANT IS CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT EATING CEREAL AS THEY WANSTEAD AS NICK BRYAN REPORTS FROM ONE OF THE GREAT FOOD CAPITALS OF THE WORLD
YES IT'S POST PUB BITS THE NEW SUGAR SPARKLED READY TO EAT
MORNING IN AMERICA NINETEEN FIFTY STAR ON THE BREAKFAST CEREAL WAS AS MUCH A STAPLE OF THE NATIONAL DIOCESE HOTDOGS AND APPLE
THAT CEREAL SALES HAVE PLUMMETED ALMOST NINE PERCENT OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS A DOWNWARD TREND THAT NOW LOOTS IRREVERSIBLE PEOPLE ARE SAYING CHEERIO CHEERIO
THINK THERE'S FAVOUR FAVOUR ANYWAY YOUR MONEY FIRST COULD BATTER THIS BRUTAL MOTHER STAB ACOSTA SERVE HER EGGS TOAST STEVEN BREAKFAST PASTA FOR HER SON
BUT NERVOUS CEREAL NO BREAKFAST CEREALS NO I DON'T THINK THEY'RE VERY HEALTHY THEY THEY SEEM TO BE FULL OF SUGAR AND TO EAT SOMETHING IN THE MORNINGS OR ANY TIME OF DAY THAT'S BEEN SET AND THEY'RE READY TO BE EATEN FOR A YEAR I DON'T THINK
VERY DELICIOUS PROSPECT OR HEALTHY AND SAUSAGE EGGS
VISIT THE BREAKFAST JOINTS OF HIPSTER HAVENS LIKE WILLIAMSBURG IN NEW YORK AND YOU'LL FIND IT'S NOT JUST KIDS WHO AREN'T EATING CEREAL BUT MILLENNIAL T'S PEOPLE BORN FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES FOR THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THESE DAYS SNAP CRACKLE AND POP JUST DOESN'T CUT
DO YOU EAT BREAKFAST CEREALS AND HIM NO NOT REALLY IF USED HIM AS A KID BEING COLLEGE A LOT OF IT IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN DO TO MAKE YOU EAT THEM AGAIN
AND I CALL THAN BORING CEREAL ISN'T REALLY I DON'T KNOW IT JUST DOESN'T DOESN'T GIVE HER ANY MORE
ORDERED TO DISBAND IT'S NOT JUST HEALTH AND NUTRITION THAT'S GETTING CEREAL CELLS WITH A PROBLEM AND PORTABILITY IN THE MAD TUMBLE OF MODERN THEY LIVE A LOT OF PEOPLE EAT BREAKFAST ON THE ROD
SERIOUS DANCE LIKE KELLOGG'S ARE TARGETING OTHER PARTS OF THE DAY ACCORDING TO FOOD INDUSTRY ANALYST AMANDA TOPPER AND A THIRD OF CEREALS AND OUR BEING CONSUMED IN THE AFTERNOON LOUIS EVENING MORE PUN SNACKING AS WINE AREA OF GROWTH WERE REALLY NOTICING MAYBE SOMETHING THAT UP REALLY DRIVE
THE SERIAL CATEGORY FOR WHERE DID SOMETHING THAT CONSUMERS ARE ALREADY FAVOURABLE TOUR AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE EMBRACING RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S REALLY I'VE TOO MANY FRACTURES TO REALLY CAN HAVE CAPITALISE ON THAT SNACKING TRY AND PROMOTE CEREALS FOR CONSUMPTION OUTSIDE OF BREAKFASTS MUSTACHIOS ON THERE REALLY
HOW ARE YOU FEELING SO FAR
PART OF ITS SERIAL COME BACK CAMPAIGN KELLOGG'S IS URGING PEOPLE TO STIR IT UP WITH CELEBRITY CHEFS CHALLENGING THEM TO ADD ADVENTUROUS NEW INGREDIENTS TO UNLEASH THEIR INNER FOODY SPECIAL CARE WITH A BIT OF COCONUT MILK BUTTER SPRINKLE SPRINKLE A P.B. TWO ON THERE A LITTLE BIT OF MAPLE SYRUP AND A BIGGER BUT THERE'S ALSO A BELIEF WITHIN THE INDUSTRY THAT IT'S NOT JUST NEWNESS THAT WILL HALT THE DOWNWARD SLIDE BUT NOSTALGIA THAT CEREAL IS THE ULTIMATE COMFORT FOOD BECAUSE IT REMINDS US OF OUR CHILDHOOD
MATILDA I'M A BIG GIRL AND I WANT A BIG INTERFERING WITH ME
THEY WERE TRAVELLING BY THAT ANY MORE THAT WAS NICK BRYANT REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT I THOUGHT WHY ISN'T YOUR CAPITAL THROUGH CUP I DON'T KNOW
DOESN'T MATTER DOES IT BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DO PUT EVERYTHING ELSE OUT OF OUR MINDS AND SPEAKER WITH US WHO WILL DO THAT THIS MORNING IT'S THE REVEREND DOCTOR ROB MARSHALL WHO IS PRIEST AT SAINT JOHN'S DIGS WELL WELWYN GARDEN CITY MORNING ROB MORNING JOHN WELL YESTERDAY ON THIS PROGRAMME I WAS STRUCK BY TWO COMPLETELY UNRELATED STORIES ABOUT FOOD WE'VE JUST HAD ANOTHER ONE OF COURSE
AND FOOD OF COURSE IS MEANT TO PROVIDE NOURISHMENT AND WELL BEING AND IT CAN BE THE SOURCE OF VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HUMAN SUFFERING AS WELL AS WE HEARD YESTERDAY SKITTER ESCALATING LEVELS OF OBESITY LEADING TO A PLETHORA OF AWFUL HEALTH COMPLICATIONS MIGHT IT WAS SUGGESTED HERE BE ALLEVIATED IF FOOD MANUFACTURERS LABEL FOOD DIFFERENTLY
EVERY CHOCOLATE BAR WRAPPER FOR INSTANCE COULD TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES ROUND THE BLOCK HE'D HAVE TO WALK TO GET RID OF THE CALORIES IT CONTAINS WOULD YOU STILL BUY IT I THINK IT MIGHT DO ACTUALLY I WOULD AT THE SAME TIME THE EATING DISORDER CHARITY BEAT HIGHLIGHTED THE DIFFICULTIES PEOPLE WITH RELATED MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE GETTING THE RELEVANT ADVICE AND SUPPORT THEY NEED WAITING TIMES FOR SERVICES VARY ENORMOUSLY THE REPORT SIMPLY STATED THE OBVIOUS THEY NEED HELP AND THEY NEED IT SOON
ANOREXIA ALONG WITH A WHOLE RAFT OF EATING RELATED DISORDERS IS OF COURSE A HUGELY COMPLEX CONDITION
MARGARET ATWOOD'S NOW PROPHETIC NOVEL THE EDIBLE WOMAN WAS RECOMMENDED READING FOR A SEMINAR I ATTENDED ON ADDICTION AND HIDDEN CONDITIONS WHEN I WAS TRAINING FOR THE PRIESTHOOD IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE LATE SIXTIES WHEN ANOREXIA WAS HARDLY TALKED ABOUT AT ALL AND IT DESCRIBES HOW THE MAIN CHARACTER MARION MCALPIN GOES FROM EATING RELATIVELY NORMALLY TO EXISTING ONLY ON VITAMIN PILLS
THE VERY SIGHT OF FOOD ON HER PLATE TURNS HER STOMACH SHE'S CONVINCED THAT HER BODY IS STARTING TO DISAPPEAR SHE'S HELPLESS AND WITHOUT HOPE
BUT HER PROBLEM IS NOT SO MUCH A PHYSICAL ONE AS EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL PROBLEM EMANATING FROM A COMBINATION OF COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS AND THE CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES AND SPIRITUAL VICISSITUDES
UTTERLY OF COURSE IS CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS AND IN MANY FAITHS TRADITIONS THE GIVING UP OF SOMETHING OR THE AVOIDING OF FOOD IS HERALDING AS GOOD FOR BOTH THE BODY AND SOUL
BUT IN AN APPROPRIATELY TITLED ARTICLE THERE IS NO FAT IN HEAVEN CAROLINE CHARLES BANKS RIGHT THAT SELF DENIAL AS WELL AS OVER CONSUMPTION PERHAPS CAN BECOME BOTH DESTRUCTIVE AND DARK THOSE AND AFFECTED BY EATING DISORDERS ARE PARADOXICALLY CONSUMED BY A NEGATIVE ASCETICISM FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO FIND A WAY FORWARD WITHOUT THAT SPECIALIST SUPPORT
I THINK IT'S REALLY STRANGE THAT THE MORE AVAILABLE AND THE MORE ATTRACTIVE AND THE MORE SOPHISTICATED FOOD BECOMES THE MORE DISORDERED OUR RESPONSE TO IT CAN BE
AND ORDERING HOW MUCH WHAT AND WHEN WE EAT TELLS US MUCH ABOUT OUR INNER BEING AS IT DOES ABOUT WHAT THE BATHROOM SCALES MIGHT HAVE SAID IF WE HOPPED ON TO THEM THIS MORNING
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE ROB MARSHALL IT IS NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT MORE MIGRANTS ARE ON THE MOVE FOR THE GREEK ISLANDS THIS MORNING BUT NOT IN THE DIRECTION THEY WERE DESPERATE TO MOVE IN TURKISH BOAT CARRYING FORTY FIVE PAKISTANI MEN HAS LEFT THE GREEK ISLAND OF LESBOS
THEY'RE AMONG WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE AT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY PEOPLE TO BE DEPORTED TODAY THEY'RE BEING SENT BACK TO TURKEY AS PART OF THAT DEAL DONE BETWEEN BRUSSELS AND ANKARA WHICH IS DESIGNED TO STOP THE BOATS AND TO HALT THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS INTO EUROPE UNDER THE DEAL TURKEYS AGREED TO TAKE THAT

THE KLINGON CARDELL AND HIS PREGNANT WIFE RENE TELL ME THEY WANT TO GO TO CANADA BUT HAVE BEEN KEPT HERE FOR SEVEN DAYS
SURE SURELY ARE CHOCOLATE GOING BACK TO CERIA IS MORE HONOURABLE THAN STAYING HERE IT'S A PRISON HERE THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFICULTIES WITH THE FOOD AND WATER
WELL YOU TOLD WHEN YOU WERE IN TURKEY FOR YOU CAME ACROSS THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE KEPT IN A CAMP WHEN YOU ARRIVED IN GREECE
AND THE SCHISM WITHIN NO IF WE KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE A PRISM RUIN HAVE COME WE THOUGHT THE RIPPLES UP OPEN FROM MACEDONIA THE OTHER MIGRANTS IN TURKEY TOLD US
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO'VE ARRIVED ON THERE'S BOSTON THE TWO WEEKS SINCE THE E.U. TURKEY DEAL WAS AGREED HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HERE IT IS OVERCROWDED PEOPLE ARE BUYING TENSE THROUGH THE FENCE TO SLEEPING BECAUSE THE GREY PORTAKABINS ARE FULL
VERY FEW WILL BE LEAVING ANY TIME SOON THE FAST TRACK ASYLUM APPLICATION PROCESS TAKES AT LEAST A WEEK MORE IF THEY APPEAL AND THEY'RE MASSIVELY UNDERSTAFFED JUMPIER CHAMOIS IS FROM THE EUROPEAN ASYLUM SUPPORT OFFICE
AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE AROUND SIXTY FIVE PEOPLE DOING THE WORK THAT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH WHEN THAT USED TO BE INCREASED AND THESE TO BE BUILT UP A SORENESS AS POSSIBLE AND WE ARE WORKING ON THAT I'M BUILDING IT UP AS FAST AS WE CAN
THESE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF PROCESSING AROUND FIFTY CASES A DAY JOB YEAH SAYS THEY NEED AT LEAST ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED OFFICERS AND INTERPRETERS HERE
A SMALL VAN FULL OF MIGRANTS BEING TAKEN FROM MORI A CLOSED CAMP TO AN OPEN CAMP IT CARROTS HAPPY FIVE KILOMETRES DOWN THE ROAD THEY'RE BEING MOVED BECAUSE THEY'RE CONSIDERED TO BE VULNERABLE CASES
AMONG THEM IS ELLA HE'S SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT AND HER TWO CHILDREN AGED TWO AND THREE SHE TELLS ME THIS CAMP IS BETTER THAN THE LAST
AND THEY HAVE THE IT WAS O.K. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'LL BE BETTER THERE WERE FIVE OR SIX FAMILIES IN THE LAST HOUSE HERE IT'S JUST US BUT IF THINGS KEEP ON GOING THIS SLOWLY I DON'T THINK I'LL MAKE IT TO GERMANY BEFORE I GIVE BIRTH I'VE HUNG HOW MARVELLOUS
WHY ISN'T YOUR HUSBAND WITH YOU DOES IT DRAW SOMETHING OF DOES MY HUSBAND PASSED AWAY IN THE WAR THERE WAS SHELLING AND SHRAPNEL WENT IN HIS NECK AND HE DIED I WAS AFRAID FOR MY CHILDREN THEY WOULD HEAR THE SOUND OF PLANES AND SHELLING AND THEY WOULD BE SCARED I DON'T IT'S BETTER TO LEAVE HIM
YES BUT THAT'S THE NAME OF THE E.U. TURKEY DEAL DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT HERE YET WHETHER IT CAN OR WILL WORK DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON WHO YOU ASK
THOSE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT IT THICK CAN WORK BUT THEY NEED MORE RESOURCES TO MAKE IT WORK IN A LAWYER HELPING MIGRANTS TOLD ME WHY DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE DESPERATE TO MAKE THE JOURNEY AND OTHERS MAKING MILLIONS FROM HELPING THEM DO IT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO COME BUT LET US TURN NOW ALIVE TO YOU AMONG CURE IS A SPOKESPERSON FOR FRONT TAX WHICH IS THE EUROPEAN BORDER AGENCY THAT'S IN CHARGE OF ALL OF THIS GOOD MORNING TO YOU

THEY INDICATE THEY DO NOT WANT TO GO OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE TODAY TODAY ALL MIGRANTS WOULD RETURN DECISIONS THEY WERE ALL PAKISTANI NATIONALS YEAH BUT MY QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DO REFUSED TO GO BECAUSE SOME AS YOU WILL KNOW A SAYING THEY WOULD RATHER COMMIT SUICIDE THAN GO BACK TO TURKEY AND EVENTUALLY BACK TO SYRIA AS THEY SEE IT WHAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THOSE PEOPLE WILL THEY BE FORCEFULLY PUT ON THE BOATS

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE EIGHTH OF APRIL THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING LABOUR HAS ACCUSE DAVID CAMERON OF SHOWING CONTEMPT FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE AFTER HE INSISTED AND INVESTMENT IN HIS LATE FATHER'S OFFSHORE FUND WAS NOT INTENDED TO DODGE TAX
THE LATEST STRIKE BY JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND HAS ENDED WITH GOVERNMENT SOURCES ARE SAYING THERE WILL BE NO FRESH TALKS MORE MIGRANTS ARE BEING SENT BACK FROM GREECE TO TURKEY AND THE POPE IS PREPARING TO ENTER ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL AREAS OF CATHOLIC DOCTRINE AS HE PUBLISHES A DOCUMENT CALLED THE JOY OF LOVE
DES NEWSREADER IS KATHY CLOAKS THEM LABOUR HAS ACCUSE DAVID CAMERON OF HYPOCRISY AFTER HE REVEALED THAT HE USED TO OWN SHARES IN AN OFFSHORE FUND SET UP BY HIS FATHER WHICH WAS NAMED IN THE PANAMA PAPERS MY CAMERON SAID HE SOLD THE SHARES AND TWENTY TEN BEFORE HE ENTERED DOWNING STREET AND INSISTS HE PAID ALL THE RELEVANT U.K. TAXES THE PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC OF TAX AVOIDANCE AND LABOUR'S TOM WATSON SAID IT WAS WRONG TO HAVE MADE JUDGEMENTS ON PEOPLE FOR DOING WHAT HE USED TO DO
MORE DETAILS FROM OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON LABOUR WANT TO MAINTAIN THE PRESSURE ON THE PRIME MINISTER BY CALLING HIM TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT NEXT WEEK BUT HIS FINANCIAL AFFAIRS THE PARTY'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON ACCUSE DAVID CAMERON OF DOUBLE STANDARDS FOR CALLING FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY AND TAX OR FEELING TO REVIEW FOR SIX YEARS BUT IT HELD SHEARS AND OVERSEAS TRUST BUT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS INSISTED HE HAS NOTHING TO HIDE
HE REVEALED THAT HE AND HIS WIFE SOLD SHARES WORTH MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS AND BLAIR MORE INVESTMENT FUND SET UP BY HIS LATE FATHER BUT HE'S HOPING THAT HIS INSISTENCE THAT WASN'T A VEHICLE FOR AVOIDING TAX AND WAS PROPERLY AUDITED WERE NO CAN SAY IN A WEEK OF BAD HEADLINES TO THE DUSTBIN OF HISTORY MY COME AND POINTED OUT THAT HE HAD PAID TAX ON SHARE DIVIDENDS BUT THERE SIMPLY IS CLAIMING HE'S LOST THE TRUST OF VOTERS
THE PRIME MINISTER NO INTENDS TO HALT THE EROSION OF THAT VALUABLE POLITICAL COMMODITY BY MAKING HIS TAX RETURNS PUBLIC THERE'S NO SUGGESTION THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL FOR MISTER CAMERON TO BENEFIT FROM AN OFFSHORE FUND BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER HE WILL SATISFY HIS CRITICS WITH HIS LATEST STATEMENT A DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR JAMES LANDALE CONSIDERS HOW DAMAGING THE REVELATION COULD BE
IN THE LONG RUN THE PRIME MINISTER WILL HOPE TO ACHIEVE HIS AIM OF DRAWING A LINE UNDER THE STORY JOURNALISTS AND OPPOSITION M.P.S WILL NATURALLY KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS BUT THERE ARE UNLIKELY TO BE MORE SIGNIFICANT REVELATIONS IN THE FACT THAT MISTER CAMERON DID INDEED BENEFIT FROM AN OFFSHORE TRUST SOMETHING THAT IS LEGAL BUT OVER WHICH PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS
THE PROBLEM FOR THE PRIME MINISTER IS THAT THE POLITICAL IMAGERY IS NOT GOOD HE IS ENGAGED IN THE POLITICAL FIGHT OF HIS LIFE TRYING TO CONVINCE THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ANYTHING LIKE THIS THAT DISTANCES MISTER CAMERON FROM THE ELECTORATE THE REMINDS PEOPLE OF HIS WEALTHY AND PRIVILEGED BACKGROUND
LET'S JUST SAY THE TIMING ISN'T GREAT
THE ARGENTINIAN PRESIDENT MORRIS YOU'RE MACARI HAS INSISTED HE HAS NOTHING TO HIDE AFTER THE LEAKED PANAMA PAPERS REVEALED HIS OFFSHORE FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN A TELEVISED ADDRESS HE SAID HE WOULD APPEAR BEFORE A JUDGE TODAY WITH ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION TO PROVE HE HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG

YOU DEAL WITH TURKEY AIMED AT CONTROLLING ILLEGAL MIGRATION TO EUROPE AS THE FERRY WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE THREE PROTESTERS JUMPED INTO THE WATER AND SWAM IN FRONT OF THE BOAT DELAYING ITS DEPARTURE THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER THE E.U.

THE E.U. ASYLUM AGENCY SAYS THEY NEED AT LEAST ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED OFFICERS AND INTERPRETERS TO PROCESS THEIR APPLICATIONS FOR ASYLUM EFFECTIVELY A FURTHER ONE HUNDRED MIGRANTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE BROUGHT HERE FROM OTHER GREEK ISLANDS AND RETURN TO TURKEY LATER TODAY
IT'S CLAIMED THE U.K. EDUCATION SYSTEM IS LETTING DION SCHOOL LEAVERS WHO DON'T FOLLOW THE TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC ROUTE INTO WORK THE HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL MOBILITY SAYS TEENAGERS WHO DON'T GO TO UNIVERSITY OR DO A. LEVELS OFTEN DRIFT INTO THEIR FIRST JOB WITHOUT THE LIFE SKILLS OR WORK EXPERIENCE THEY NEED THE COMMITTEE WANT STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE AT FOURTEEN WHICH PATH TO PURSUE
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PEER LADY TYLER IS ON THE COMMITTEE AND TOLD US THEY TOOK EVIDENCE FROM A NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS WHO WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM
MANY OF THEM SAID THAT THE CURRENT VERY STRONG FOCUS ON JUST ONE ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS WASN'T GIVING THEM WHAT THEY WANTED IN TERMS OF CHOOSING YOUNG PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT THE RIGHT SORT OF TEAMWORK SKILLS WHO TIME MANAGEMENT YOU COULD WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE SELF MOTIVATED AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF WHAT'S SOMETIMES CALLED LIFE SKILLS OR EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS
THE FOURTH STRIKE BY JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND ABOUT THEIR DISPUTE A NEW CONTRACT HAS JUST ENDED WITH LITTLE SIGN OF PROGRESS TOWARDS A SOLUTION N.H.S. FIGURES SUGGEST THAT FORTY TWO PERCENT OF DOCTORS REPORTED FOR WORK YESTERDAY A SLIGHTLY LOWER PROPORTION THAN ON WEDNESDAY ALTHOUGH MANY WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDING EMERGENCY CARE HERE'S OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JIM DRAPER
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND THE DOCTORS' UNION APPEAR AS FAR APART AS EVER GOVERNMENT SOURCES HAVE RULED OUT ANY CHANCE OF TALKS BEFORE THE NEXT STRIKE AT THE END OF THIS MONTH WHEN JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND WILL STOP PROVIDING EMERGENCY ANDREW TEAM WORK FOR NINE HOURS ON TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS THAT WILL BE THE FIRST ALL OUT STOPPAGE IN THE HEALTH SERVICES HISTORY
THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO IMPOSE ITS CONTRACT IN THE SUMMER BUT DOCTORS ARE ATTEMPTING TO LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE NEW PAY STRUCTURE THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SAYS THE CONTRACT IS UNFAIR ON ITS MEMBERS AND UNSAFE FOR PATIENTS MINISTERS SAY THE STRIKE SO IRRESPONSIBLE AND THE CHANGES ARE NECESSARY FOR BETTER WEEKEND CARE
ESTIMATES FROM THREE SEPARATE CLIMATE AND ENERGY EXPERTS SUGGEST THAT TATA STEEL WHICH HAS PUT ITS BRITISH BUSINESS INTERESTS UP FOR SALE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROFITS FROM A POLICY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT THEY'VE CALCULATED THE TUT ARE MADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS SELLING CARBON EMISSIONS PERMITS IT WAS GIVEN FOR FREE UNDER THE E. USE EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME THERE HAVE BEEN CLAIMS THAT Y. YOU CLIMB CLIMATE POLICIES HELPED UNDERMINE THE COMPANY
SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME THUMPETY YOUNG HE'S AN E.U. POLICY DIRECTOR ON CARBON EMISSIONS SAID TATA HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG THEY HAVE RECEIVED MORE FREE CARBON FIRMER STAND IT ACTUALLY NEED A TOOK OFFERED OUR MISSIONS ARE REMAINING FREE BURMA THEY COULD SELL FOR A PROFIT IN THERE MIKE IT'S NOT A STEEL ACCORDING TO A STUDY ESTIMATE EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION YEAR OLD PROFITS BETWEEN THE YEARS TWO DOESN'T AID UNTIL DOESN'T FOURTEEN DESIS ABOUT'S OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS
THE ONLINE TAXI FIRM HAS AGREED TO SETTLE A LAWSUIT BROUGHT IN THE AMERICAN STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER HIYA DESCRIBED VETTING PROCEDURES FOR ITS DRIVERS THE COMPANY HAD CALLED ITSELF THE GOLD STANDARD FOR SAFETY BUT NICE SAYS IT WILL CHANGE ITS ADVERTS IT WILL PAY SEVEN MILLION POUNDS AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT DAILY REPORTS FROM SAN FRANCISCO
IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE A TRADITIONAL TAXI IN CALIFORNIA YOU NEED TO PROVIDE A FINGERPRINT TO CHECK FOR PRIOR CONVICTIONS BUT TO DRIVE AND BIRTH THAT'S NOT NECESSARY AS THE COMPANY USES A DIFFERENT SYSTEM TO VET ITS DRIVERS
SO WHEN OVER ADVERTISED ITSELF AS THE SAFEST DRIVE ON THE ROAD AUTHORITIES CRIED FOUL PROSECUTOR SAID GRUBER MISSED TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE WITH PRIOR CONVICTIONS INCLUDING SEVERAL SEX OFFENDERS AND A CONVICTED MURDERER WHO WE SAID NO SYSTEM COULD EVER BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SAFE AND THAT IT'S TECHNOLOGY HAS ADDED PROTECTION THAT SOME MORE TRADITIONAL TAXIS DO NOT OFFER
POPE FRANCIS WILL TODAY MAKE PUBLIC THE CONCLUSIONS OF HIS TWO SIN ODDS ON THEIR FAMILY IN A DOCUMENT EAGERLY AWAITED BY THE WORLD'S ROMAN CATHOLICS
IN WHAT'S KNOWN AS AN APOSTOLIC EXHORTATION THE POPE WILL GIVE HIS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT FAMILY LIFE MARRIAGE CONTRACEPTION AND BRINGING UP CHILDREN
A RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE WYATT REPORTS FOR THREE YEARS POPE FRANCIS HAS PREPARED THE WAY FOR THIS DOCUMENT ON THEIR FAMILY KNOWN BY ITS LATIN NAME THAT TRANSLATES AS THE JOY OF LOVE
FIRST HE SENT A QUESTIONNAIRE TO FAMILIES ACROSS THE WORLD ASKING THEM ABOUT THEIR HOPES AND THEIR FEARS AND THEN HE BROUGHT BISHOPS AND CARDINALS TOGETHER FOR TWO SYNODS IN ROME THAT WHICH HE ENCOURAGED THEM TO DEBATE AND EVEN TO DISAGREE OVER ISSUES THAT DIVIDE THE CHURCH IN MANY COUNTRIES THERE'S RANGE FROM OFFERING COMMUNION TO THE DIVORCED AND REMARRIED CONTRACEPTION AND THE TREATMENT OF CATHOLICS WHO ARE GAY
WHEN HE DOCUMENT THAT WILL BE RELEASED IN ROME WILL SHOW EXACTLY WHERE POPE FRANCIS STANDS AND SOME WERE ALREADY DESCRIBING IT AS A PAPAL BOMBSHELL AS THE POPE STEPS INTO THE MINEFIELD OF CATHOLIC TEACHING ON THE FAMILY
CAROLINE WYATT REPORT IN THERE THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT IF THERE'S A RULE BOOK OUT THERE FOR HOW TO SURVIVE IN POLITICS THE GOLDEN RULE BE SORTED THIS THE COVER UP IS MORE DAMAGING THAN THE CRIME ESPECIALLY IF THAT HASN'T EVEN BEEN A CRIME THE GREAT MISTAKE IS TO GIVE PEOPLE THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING
WHICH IS WHAT DAVID CAMERON MANAGED TO DO THIS WEEK WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS FINANCIAL AFFAIRS AND WHETHER HE HAD BENEFITED FROM INVESTMENTS MADE BY HIS LATE FATHER IN AN OFFSHORE TAX HAVEN TOOK ONE INTERVIEW AND THREE STATEMENTS FROM NUMBER TEN BEFORE HE FINALLY ADMITTED LAST NIGHT YES HE HAD SO HAS IT REALLY DAMAGED HIM OR WILL PEOPLE FINALLY CONCLUDE THAT WELL IT'S
JUST A FUSS ABOUT NOTHING REALLY LET'S TALK TO TWO SENIOR POLITICIANS ABOUT THAT THE SKILLS MINISTER NICK BOLES SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY OWEN SMITH MISTER SMITH WE KNOW THAT YOUR PARTY HAS ACCUSED MISTER CAMERON OF HYPOCRISY AND SO ON AND SO ON BUT WHAT DID HE ACTUALLY DO WRONG
I THINK THE FIRST THING AS YOU SAY JOHN IS WE'VE HAD TO DRAG THIS OUT OF HIM IF HE WASN'T TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING WHY DIDN'T HE CONFESSED TO THIS IS IT WE'RE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK WHY INDEED DIDN'T REGISTER HE'S INTERESTING THIS OFFSHORE COMPANY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN HE FIRST BECAME AN M.P. BECAUSE HE'S THE FIRST WE BALLOONED IT AND IT'S TAKEN A WEEK OF PERSISTENT QUESTIONING TO GET IT OUT OF HIM AND THERE WERE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT HE'S DONE WRONG IS QUITE CLEARLY
HE SPEAKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF HIS MOUTH AND HE HAS DONE FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS ON THE ONE HAND HE'S BEEN EXHORTING EVERYBODY TO NOT AVOID HE'S TALK ABOUT IS MORALLY REPUGNANT AND SAID WE SHOULD ALL PAY OUR TAXES AND ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAS BENEFITED FROM A INVENT AN INVESTMENT VEHICLE THAT IS ESSENTIALLY EH TAX AVOIDANCE VEHICLE AND THAT IT'S CLEAN AND SIMPLE DOUBLE STANDARDS NOT AVOID TAXI PAID THE TAX THAT HE HAD TO PAY
YEAH WELL I UNDERSTAND HOW THESE VEHICLES WORK BUT THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT HAVING AN OFFSHORE INVESTMENT VEHICLE LIKE THIS IS TO LIMIT TAX LIABILITIES THE TAX THE VIEW THAT'S THE POINT REALLY IF HE HAD AVOIDED TAX YEAH YOU'D HAVE A CASE BUT HE DIDN'T AVOID TAXI PAID THE TAX WOULD KNOW LET'S BE CLEAR EDGE ON THE WHOLE POINT OF THESE VEHICLES PIECE TO AVOID TAX THAT'S WHY THEY ARE HELD OFFSHORE IN PANAMA OR IN THE BAHAMAS OR WHEREVER TO THE VEHICLE IN WHICH HE WAS INVESTING
WASN'T PAYING TAX AND HADN'T PAYING TAX IT APPEARS FOR THIRTY YEARS WE DON'T KNOW THAT HE PAID TAX DAVID CAMERON EVERY YEAR ON THIS WE DO KNOW THEY HAVE TO REPORT EVERY YEAR BUT WHAT HE DID WAS PAY TAX AT THE END OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH HE HELD THIS INVESTMENT WHICH WORKS WITH THE BRIGHTON PROPER THING TO DO ABOUT OF COURSE IT IS OF COURSE IT IS AND THESE THINGS AREN'T ILLEGAL BUT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO AVOID SCRUTINY AND TAXATION
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE HELD OVERSEAS STRESS OTHERWISE IT'S IS FRANKLY CLAWS OR OR YOU COULD SAY YOUR FATHER RUNS THIS OPERATION AND YOU TRUST YOUR FATHER PEOPLE TEND TO TRUST THEIR FATHERS DON'T THEY IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY LEGAL ENTITY THAT HE WAS RUNNING NO PROBLEMS WITH THAT WHATSOEVER AND HE'S GOT A FEW QUID TO SPEND WILL HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE GOT TEN THOUSAND POUNDS TO INVEST SO THEY INVESTED IN THEIR FATHER'S FIRM
PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE DONE THAT WOULDN'T THEY IF THEY WERE IN A POSITION TO DO SO THAT IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T EVER BE IN A POSITION WHERE I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WELL I THINK FOR A TINY PROPORTION OF PEOPLE THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND THIS BUT THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH YOU AVOID MUDDY AND THAT TOO IS THE BIG
QUESTION IS IT EFFECTIVELY ONE RULE FOR THE RICH AND THE RICH WHO RUN THE TORY PARTY RIGHT NOW UNDER ANOTHER RULE FOR THE REST THAT'S A VERY GOOD ARGUMENT THOUGH ISN'T IT THAT'S O.K. I THINK IT'S PART OF THE BIG PICTURE JOHN COS I SAY IT IS ABOUT TRUST IT'S ABOUT CHARACTER AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO POWER ARGUING WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER EVERYBODY'S GOT TO MAKE SACRIFICES AND CLEARLY THAT IS NOT TRUE IN THIS EPISODE REVEALS THAT IN STAR BUT YOU'RE UPSET THAT'S AN END OF IT NOW ARE THE OTHER QUESTION SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
YOU THE LABOUR PARTY WANT ANSWERED I THINK THERE ARE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY DAVID CAMERON DIDN'T REVEAL THIS EARLIER IF THIS WAS SUCH A PLAIN VANILLA VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD INVESTMENT WHY DID HE FEEL HE COULDN'T MENTION IT IN THE PAST HE'S BEEN ASKED ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING ON MANY MANY OTHER POINTS YOU WANT TO ASK AT ALL I THINK VERY STRAIGHTFORWARDLY THE PRIME MINISTER USED TO COME TO THE COUNTRY AND I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT IN PARLIAMENT NEXT WEEK AND COME CLEAN ABOUT
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S REAL INTENTIONS ARE ABOUT TAX AVOIDANCE ARE THEY WRITE ABOUT HIM HE DID NOTHING ABOUT HIM PERSONALLY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR HIS OWN BEHAVIOUR PERSONALLY WELL HE SAID HE'S GOING TO PUBLISH HIS TAX RETURN AND I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING ADMISSION THAT HE NOW NEEDS TO DO THAT I THINK HE WILL NEED TO GO FURTHER AND BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HIS INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST LET'S HOPE THIS IS THE ONLY THING WE'VE GOT TO DRAG OUT OF HIM BUT I THINK PEOPLE WILL NOW HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THE
TRUSTWORTHINESS OF A PRIME MINISTER GIVIN THAT HE HAS BEEN SO REVEALED AS BEING YOU'RE HAVING DOUBLE STANDARD SPEAKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF HIS MOUTH NOT BEING TRUE I THINK TO WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD DO WHEN HE CAME TO POWER AND ALLOW SUNLIGHT TO DISINFECT HIM SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH NICK BOWLS THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT BUT HE HAS HE'S TARNISHED HIMSELF
I THINK IT WAS A NATURAL HUMAN THING WHEN THESE REVELATIONS WERE FIRST PUBLISHED AND PEOPLE STARTED ATTACKING HIS FATHER WHO DIED SIX YEARS AGO WHO HE LOVES VERY MUCH AND WHO CAN'T DEFEND HIMSELF AND IT WAS NATURAL HUMAN REACTION TO NOT WANT TO INTRUDE FURTHER ON ITS FATHER'S WAS REALLY NICE TO DO THAT HE WAS ASKED WHAT ABOUT HIS OWN PERSONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND HE DUCKED THE QUESTION NOT ONCE NOT TWICE NOT THREE BUT FOUR TIMES
I UNDERSTAND THE POINT AND I'M SURE THAT WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT HE WOULD RATHER THAT ALL OF WHAT HAS COME OUT OVER THE LAST FOUR DAYS HAD COME OUT ON THEIR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT BUT I THINK IT WAS IN HIS OWNER AND I DO UNDERSTAND BUT I THINK THE INSTINCT IS ONE THAT WE ALL CAN IDENTIFY WITH EVEN IF IT WAS WAS WAS SOMETHING THAT HE MIGHT WELL HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY WELL I'VE GONE THERE'S A SORT OF IN A WAY IT'S CRUEL BUT THERE YOU GO TO CRUEL WORLD PRIME MINISTER'S AREN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE THESE FIRST
WELL I'LL TRY AND GET AWAY WITH IT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT ALL THEY KNOW I AGREE BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SUGGESTION YOU TRYING TO GET AWAY WITH IT IS HE WHY DO YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT HE HAD PAID U.K. TAX ON ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT HE HADN'T BENEFITED FROM SOME TAX AVOIDANCE SCHEME HE KNEW THAT AND TAXATION IS A PRIVATE MATTER IN THIS COUNTRY WE DON'T ALL HAVE TO PUBLISH OUR TAX RETURNS IN SOME COUNTRIES EVERYBODY DOES IN SCANDINAVIA LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE PERSON INCLUDING YOU JOHN
WE'D HAVE TO PUBLISH YOUR TAX RETURN BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN THE U.K. IT IS A PRIVATE MATTER AND SO I THINK HE THOUGHT I KNOW THAT I HAVE COMPLIED FULLY WITH ALL OF THE TAX LAWS AND I DON'T LIKE DOING THIS MILL OF OAK OF PRAYING ON HIS FATHER'S MEMORY FATHER CANNOT WELL THAT REALLY ARE CRYING AND HIS FATHER'S MEMORY NOBODY WAS DOING THAT WERE THEY WHAT THAT WHAT THEY'RE POINTING OUT AND THE
SHADOW TREASURY MINISTER RICHARD BURNING HIMSELF SAID THIS THAT KEY DIRECTLY BENEFITED FROM BLAIR MORE A COMPANY WHICH PAID NO TAX IN THIRTY YEARS THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT BUT THE THING ABOUT UNIT TRUST EDITING IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE LISTENERS TO UNDERSTAND THAT UNIT TRUST THE WAY IT WORKS A UNIT TRUST IS THAT THE
THE INVESTMENT IS THE TAX TREATMENT OF THE INVESTMENT IS THE TAX FREE OF THE INVESTOR AND WHERE THEY ARE AND AS AN INVESTOR IN THE U.K. HE WAS SUBJECT TO U.K. TAX CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND INCOME TAX ON DIVIDEND SET UP A COMPANY IN A WAY THAT WAS DESIGNED DELIBERATELY TO AVOID TAX THAT IS THE CASE OF THE WIRE THAT'S WHY WAS HE JETTING OFF TO ALL SORTS OF
PLACES PART WHERE OR WHEN IT HAPPENED TO BE THE SET UP THIS COMPANY THAT IS WHAT HE DID AND THAT WAS THE OBJECTIVE BEHIND IT AND ADMITTED THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE DOING AT THE SAME TIME AND IT WAS NOT ILLEGAL BUT THE FACT IS HE DID IT AND DAVID CAMERON
BENEFITED FROM THAT BUT DO DID JOHN LLOYD HE WAS SEE THEN LITERALLY WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID EXACTLY THE REASON WHY THE PRIME MINISTER WAS NOT KEEN RIGHT AT THE START OF THE WEEK TO GET INTO THIS BECAUSE YOU STARTED SAYING HIS FATHER DID THIS HIS FATHER DID THAT HIS FATHER DID AS THE LEADING UP YOUR CRUCIAL FATHER IS NOT HIS FATHER'S NOT HERE TO DEFEND HIMSELF BUT I'M NOT ATTACHED I SAID INSTANTLY THAN THAT WAS PERFECTLY ILLEGAL THE POINT I WAS LEADING UP TO WAS THAT MISTER CAMERON BENEFITED FROM THAT THAT'S THE POINT
HE PAID TAX ON ANY BENEFITS THAT CAME TO HIM WHETHER THOSE BENEFITS WERE DIVIDEND PERHAPS LOOK UP AT THE WINDOW SO WELL HAD IT BEEN PAYING TAX IN THE WAY THE COMPANY'S BASED IN THIS COUNTRY WOULD HAVE DONE THAT'S THE POINT DOESN'T IT BUT WILL THAT BIT BID THAT DID THIS IS THE UNIT TRUST SYSTEM I MEAN THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THEM AND THEY WERE REGISTERED WITH H.M.R.C. AS THIS ONE WAS THEY DECLARE THEIR RESULTS IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS THIS ONE DID AND THE WAY IN WHICH UNIT TRUST WORKED IS THAT THE INVESTORS PAID THEIR TAX IN WHEREVER THEY ARE AND IF YOU'RE A U.K. INVESTOR
THEN YOU PAY U.K. TAX INCOME TAX AND CAPITAL GAINS SET AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE THE VERY VERY LEAST THAT HE'S DONE THERE IS DESTROY THE NOTION THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER THERE'S NOT A SOUL OUT THERE I IMAGINE LISTENING TO US TALKING THAT'S RIGHT YARD JUST LIKE THEY BECOME REALLY
WELL I THINK THE POINT IS THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY VERY CLEAR THAT HE HAD A VERY VERY LUCKY AND PRIVILEGED START IN LIFE HE'S NEVER MADE ANY BONES ABOUT IT IN WHEN WE'RE ALL IN THE STICK WITH THAT IF YOU REMEMBER WAS REFERRING TO THE PROCESS OF DEFICIT REDUCTION AND WHO IT AFFECTS WHAT YOU FIND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES IS THAT HE'S THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN SOCIETY WHO ARE NOW PAYING THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF TAX
THAN HAS EVER BEEN A GIRL WITH THEM ALL IN THIS TOGETHER THAT'S NEITHER I KNOW I THINK WE WILL BECAUSE IT'S TRUE WE HAVE THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY NOW PAY A GREATER SHARE OF INCOME TAX THAN WAS EVER TRUE UNDER ANY LABOUR GOVERNMENT NOW THAT'S RIGHT AND PROPER BECAUSE THESE RICH PEOPLE ARE MAKING GOOD MONEY AND THEY SHOULD BE PAYING THEIR TAX BUT IT IS UNDER A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT AND TO DAVID CAMERON'S PRIME MINISTER SHIP THAT THE RICH ARE PAYING MORE IN TAX
AND UNDER ANY PREVIOUS GO RIGHT BUT BUT DO YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE FROM WHAT YOU SAID THIS MORNING AND MANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES OBVIOUSLY ACCEPT THAT MISTER CAMERON GOT IT WRONG WHEN HE DUCK QUESTIONS AS HE DID IN THE TRUTH I HAD TO BE DRAGGED OUT OF HIM AS IT WERE THAT'S THE APPEARANCE OF IT OVER THE LAST WEEK HOW MUCH DAMAGE DO YOU THINK IT HAS DONE TO HIM
I DON'T THINK IT HAS BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE OF FAIR MINDED AND THAT THEY WILL WANT TO SEE FIRSTLY DID HE PAY WILL OR ALL OF THE TAX THAT HE SHOULD HAVE PAID AND HE DID DID HE BREAK ANY LAWS HE DIDN'T AND I THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT HE'S PRIME MINISTER YES BUT HE'S ALSO A HUMAN BEING AND HE'S HER SON AND HE'S A SON WHO LOST HIS FATHER A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE ALL HAVE NATURAL HUMAN INSTINCTS TO RALLY AROUND OUR FAMILY AN UNFORTUNATELY AS PRIME MINISTER
YOU DO SOMETIMES HAVE TO SUBJECT YOUR YOUR FAMILY TO A LEVEL OF EXPOSURE THAT ASKED OF OTHER PEOPLE IN SOCIETY AND I THINK HE RECOGNISES THAT WHICH IS WHY HE'S DECIDED TO PUBLISH HIS TAX RETURN BUT I THINK PEOPLE WILL BE FORGIVING THEY WOULD NOT BE FORGIVING IF THERE WAS ANY QUESTION
THAT HE'D AVOIDED ANY TAX OR OR SOME HAD BENEFITED FROM SOME OR TAX EVASION SCHEME BUT EVEN THOUGH THE LABOUR SPOKESMAN YOU INTERVIEWED EARLIER WAS CLEAR THE BACK THERE IS NO SUGGESTION OF THAT AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT HE'S A SONG AS WELL AS A PRIME MINISTER NICK THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED IT IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT
OH REALLY
M. M. ME AS ONE HAD TO GO ON IT'S NOT GOING TO GO ON THAT'S IT TWENTY THREE SECONDS THOUGH HE GET FROM THE ARIA ILL DON'T CHEFS WERE NO DONIZETTI'S LUCIA DE LA MA'AM ALL RIGHT SON BYE INVITE CHARCOAL AT WITH THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AT LAST NIGHT THOUGH IT WAS OPENING THE OPENING OF A PRODUCTION AT THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE
WHICH HAD BEEN PRECEDED BY WARNINGS THAT THERE WOULD BE EXPLICIT SEX SCENES AND VIOLENCE TO IT FOLLOWS A WILLIAM TELL PRODUCTION THAT HAD A RAPE SCENE THAT UPSET PEOPLE LAST YEAR SO THEY FELT THE OPERA THAT THEY NEEDED TO HAVE THOSE WARNING CHARLOTTE HIGGINS IS CHIEF CULTURE WRITER FOR THE GUARDIAN AND WAS THERE LAST NIGHT I WASN'T IS AND HOW WAS IT LEFT
I WAS I WAS INCREDIBLY SHAKEN AND MOVED AND COMPLETELY COMPELLED BY ACTUALLY IT WAS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND PRODUCTION AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCES FROM THE CAST AND THE RECEPTION WAS
PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY TO BECAUSE IT WAS BOOZE AS MUCH AS IT WAS CHEERED SO THERE IS A REAL FEELING OF DIVISION IN THE AUDIENCE BOOED BECAUSE OF THOSE SCENES OR BOO JUST COS PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK WAS A GOOD PRODUCTION I THINK
I MEAN I WASN'T ONE OF THE BEARERS BUT MY IMPRESSION IS THAT THE UM THE BOOING WAS BECAUSE THAT KATIE MET TILL THE DIRECTOR OF THIS PRODUCTION HAD
INSERTED QUITE A LOT OF MATERIAL THAT WOULD HELP US TO EXPLAIN AND DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THE CHAIR DID ANIMAL HE DOES AT THE END OF THE OPERA STAB THE HUSBAND SHE'S BEEN FORCED TO MARRY AND THEN AND THEN IT STARTS AND THIS EXTRAORDINARY FAMOUS MAD SCENE AS IT'S CALLED M. THAT IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE CHAIRS AND AMA MORE AND WHAT KATIE MITCHELL DID WAS GET GIVES MUCH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY THAT MIGHT HAVE LED HER TO DO THAT SLIGHTLY HELEN ARCHER ESQUE
ACTS WHICH WHERE'S THAT'S NEVER BEEN USED TO DESCRIBE A PROGRAMME BUT NOT EVERYONE BUT THEY'LL HAVE OUTPUT AND THEY'VE BEEN WARNED EVERYONE HAD BEEN WARNED THAT SHOULD THAT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH IN YOUR
WELL I MEAN I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO ASK THE OPERA HOUSE BUT WHY THEY TOOK THE DECISION TO WARN THEIR CUSTOMER BASE THAT SAY THAT THEY'RE REGULAR AUDIENCE THEIR TICKET HOLDERS FOR ME I DIDN'T FIND THE MORNING PARTICULARLY NECESSARY AND I HAD THE PREVIOUS WEEK SEEN A PRODUCTION BY THE SAME DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL THEATRE WHERE NO WARNINGS WERE ISSUED AND YET WE DID SEE
PEOPLE'S FEET BEING CHOPPED OFF IN ANGLE GRINDERS AND PEOPLE'S TONGUES BEING CUT OFF BECAUSE THAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE PLAY BY SARAH KANE THAT THE GREAT PLAY CLEANSED AND I THINK THAT PROBABLY IS A REFLECTION OF DIFFERENT AUDIENCE EXPECTATIONS FOR DIFFERENT ART FORMS IN A DIFFERENT INSTITUTE SAM AND I SUPPOSE THE POINT IS IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
BOO ANYWAY I'LL BE UPSET BY WHAT THEY SEE AND THEY HAVE BEEN WORN PERHAPS THAT IS A SIGN THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE THE THE WATERS I WANT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND IN A WAY INFANTA LIGHTING PEOPLE AND ACTUALLY YOU GO AND YOU SEE IT AND YOU LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T LIKE IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT
I WOULD BE INCLINED TO THAT VIEW BUT CLEARLY IT'S BETWEEN THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE AND FOR AND THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR AUDIENCE THEY THEY FEEL THEY HAVE TO DO THIS PERHAPS PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THEY CAN TELL THAT YOU JUST REFER TO LAST YEAR
BUT THE THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT IS INESCAPABLY VIOLENT AND UNPLEASANT IT DOES CONTAIN A WOMAN MURDERING THE HUSBAND THAT SHE'S BEEN FORCED TO MARRY WHAT CASEY MEASURED IT ALWAYS HAS A ISN'T IT EXACTLY EXACTLY SHOULDN'T HEAR SURPRISED TO PEOPLE GOING TO THESE ARE DARK DARK AND SCARY
EXTRAORDINARY PIECES OF WORK THEY'RE NOT THERE TO COMFORT US THEY ARE THERE TO MAKE US THINK ABOUT OUR OWN LIVES AND TO TAKE US TO TO DARK AND UNPLEASANT PLACES WHAT KATIE MITCHELL DID AND I THINK PEOPLE PROBABLY OBJECTED TO WAS TO ADD TO THE PSYCHOLOGY THAT LEAD US TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DID THIS SHE SHE GAVE ME CHEER AND HER LOVER ARE VERY PASSIONATE SIXTEEN SHE LOVED US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHAIR WAS PREGNANT AND
SHE PUT THE STABBING ON STAGE IT'S NORMALLY OFFSTAGE THERE THE WHOLE MESSY GREASE AND BUSINESS HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO KILL A BIG STRONG MAN WAS REALLY EXPLORED AND THEN SHE GAVE ME A
MISCARRIAGE SO THERE'S A MISCARRIAGE ON THE STAGE OF THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE WHICH I GUESS PEOPLE WEREN'T QUITE EXPECTING AND IT WAS GRUESOME AND UNPLEASANT BUT THAT'S LIFE
CHARLOTTE HIGGINS CHIEF CULTURE WRITER FOR THE GUARDIAN THANK YOU THERE'S EITHER IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT IT'S GARY WITH THE SPORT THE MAIN MORNING AT MASTERS GOLF HEADLINES DEFENDING CHAMPION JORDAN SPEAKS HAS A TWO SHOT LEAD FROM IRELAND SHANE LOWRY ENGLAND'S PAUL CASEY JUSTIN ROSE AND IAN POULTER OR ARE POISED TO POUNCE CURRENTLY THREE BEHIND DANNY WILLETTS IS FOUR OFF THE LAID ALONG WITH RORY MCELROY THE CONDITIONS WERE BLUSTERY AND TRICKY OUT THERE I WAS FOR UNDER A THREE THE PLAY SO WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE

SOME ARGUE THAT THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT IS IRRELEVANT TO THE THREATS WE FACE TODAY OTHERS THAT ITS EXISTENCE HAS HELPED PREVENT WORLD WAR THREE
THE ORIGINS OF TRIDENT AND ITS PREDECESSOR POLARIS LIE IN THE COLD WAR WHEN THE NEED TO MAKE THE DETERRENT ALMOST UNDETECTABLE UNDERWATER DROVE A REVOLUTION THE NAVAL ENGINEERING
NUCLEAR PROPULSION WOULD ALLOW SUBMARINES TO CRISS CROSS THE OCEANS SILENTLY AND UNDETECTED
THE FIRST ALL BRITISH DOES A NUCLEAR SUBMARINE H.M.S. VALIANT WENT INTO SERVICE FIFTY YEARS AGO BUT NOT WITHOUT MANY TEETHING PROBLEMS SCRAPES WITH THE ENEMY SUBMARINES AND SOME DISASTROUSLY SHORT RATIONS IN THE PERSONAL COMFORT DEPARTMENT AS WE'LL HEAR FROM OFFICERS AND MEN WHO SERVED IN HER IN THE REUNION THIS MORNING AT NINE

A GROUP OF FORTY FIVE PAKISTANI MIGRANTS HAVE ARRIVED IN TURKEY AFTER BEING EXPELLED FROM GREECE UNDER AN E. YOU DEAL TO REDUCE NUMBERS REACHING EUROPE MORE MIGRANTS ARE DUE TO FOLLOW THE FIRST GROUP ARRIVED IN TURKEY ON MONDAY DETECTIVES SEARCHING FOR A METROPOLITAN POLICE OFFICER HER FIND HUMAN REMAINS AND ARRESTED A FORTY NINE YEAR OLD MAN ON SUSPICION OF MURDER P.C. GORDON SAMPLE WAS LAST SEEN A WEEK AGO
FRESH TALKS TO BREAK THE DEADLOCK IN THE JUNIOR DOCTORS DISPUTE AND ENGLAND HAVE BEEN RULED OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT THE LATEST FORTY EIGHT HOUR STRIKE BY DOCTORS AND HAVE THIS MORNING A FULL WALKABOUT IS SCHEDULED FOR THREE WEEKS' TIME
THANK YOU TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE AS WE WERE HEARING MORE PEOPLE ARE ON THE MOVE THIS MORNING FROM LES BOSS THE GREEK ISLAND BACK TO TURKEY A SMALL VESSEL TOOK FORTY FIVE PAKISTANI MEN FROM LES MOSS TO THE TURKISH PORT AND EQUALLY THEY'LL BE TAKEN THEN TO HOLDING CENTRES AND THEN EVENTUALLY DEPORTED HER BACK TO PAKISTAN IN LINE WITH WHAT THE GREEK AUTHORITIES HAVE DECREED
IN GREECE MEANWHILE THE AUTHORITIES SAY NONE OF THE MIGRANTS ON THAT BOAT OR INDEED ON PREVIOUS BOAT THAT WENT EARLIER IN THE WEEK HAD CLAIMED ASYLUM REFUGEE SUPPORTERS AND GREECE HAVE TRIED TO HALT THE VESSELS THIS MORNING BY SWIMMING IN FRONT OF THEM AT LEAST THE ONE THAT HAS GONE AND ONE MORE THAT IS DUE TO GO WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY SASHA MYERS FROM SAVE THE CHILDREN HE'S BEEN AT THE DETENTION CENTRES IN LES BUS AND ALSO BY COST US KRYSTLE SOUTHERN ASKS WHO IS A GREEK ANY PAY FROM THE RULING CIRRUS HAVE PARTY MORNING TO YOU BOTH
SASHA MAYA'S FIRST OF ALL WE WERE HEARING EARLIER FROM THE FRONTEX SPOKESMAN FRONT TAKES THE BORDER AGENCY THAT THINGS TODAY ARE GOING RELATIVELY SMOOTHLY FROM WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IS THAT IS THAT TRUE
SO THE CHILDREN HE'S SHOCKED AND DISMAYED THAT THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONTINUED TO BE RETURNED TO TURKEY THIS MORNING WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE ARE THE RIGHT LEGAL SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING
THAT HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO TAKE YOU'VE ACTUALLY HAD A CHANCE TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM AND HAS HAD THEIR FINE FILLY HEAD THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THIRTEEN PEOPLE THEY WERE RETURNED ON MONDAY ACTUALLY WANNA TO CLAIM ASYLUM BUT IN THE CHAOS OF THE SITUATION HERE THEY WON'T GIVE HIM THAT OPPORTUNITY
WE'RE STILL CALLING ON E. ELENA'S TO SUSPEND FAIR THE DEPORTATIONS UNTIL THEY HAVE THE CORRECT CAPACITY IN THE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES
TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE BEING RETURNED TO TAKE HER YOU WILL BE SAFE AND WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM BUT WHAT WE WERE HERE IN HALF AN HOUR AGO FROM FRONT TAXES THAT ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE GOT ON THE BOATS SO FAR HAVE DONE SO
IF NOT WILLINGLY THEN THEY HAVEN'T OBJECTED TO THE ACTUAL FINAL JOURNEY THEY HAVE TO TAKE BACK TO TURKEY NOBODY HAS TRIED NOT TO GO AND NONE OF THEM ARE TRYING TO CLAIM HER
WELL WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO CLAIM ASYLUM AND WE BELIEVE AT THE MOMENT MORE THAN I THINK NINETY PER CENT OF PEOPLE INSIDE AND WORRY DETENTION CENTRE HAS EXPRESSED A WISH TO CLAIM ASYLUM
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE AT THE MOMENT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ATTEND TODAY DIDN'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AS WELL AND WE REALLY THINK
DEPORTATION SHOULD BEEN SUSPENDED UNTIL GREECE HAS THE RIGHT HUMAN RESOURCES AND
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE PROCESS IS FAIR FOR EVERYONE
GROOM CHRIS ORGANISED DO YOU AGREE THAT THE PROCESS AT THE MOMENT IS TOO CHAOTIC TO BE A REASONABLE ONE
IT'S HER FIRST EGGS SO I HOPE THAT THIS SITUATION I WOULD BE MODERN BORDER IN THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS AND THEY'VE GOT ON WITH MY GRAND DEMOB HAIR ALL RIGHT FOR A ON IN THE E.U. BUT NOT TAPPING THAT GRACE GOOD BE FIRED ALONG IT'S A COLLECTIVE DECISION WHAT OF IT
WHERE PLACES GRIGGS INGRID SEWARD MOUNDS OF GOING HAVE MUCH MORE SO THEY'VE GOT TO MAKE MY GUN BUT WHEREVER ISN'T THAT THE POINT SESSION MYERS THAT ACTUALLY THIS PROCESS ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT SEEM BRUTAL AND THE BRUTAL TO SOME OF THOSE INVOLVED IT HAS TO HAPPEN EH BECAUSE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE REALLY DON'T
A RIGHT TO BE IN EUROPE BUT ME
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT TRYING TO MAKE THAT JOURNEY THAT DESPERATELY DANGEROUS JOURNEY ACROSS THEIR G. AND C. IS WRONG THAT THEY SHOULDN'T DO IT
NOW HANG ON A SECOND FLED FOR SASHA MIGHT NOT COME BACK TO YOU
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EVERYONE COMING HERE HAS THEIR OWN STORY
THAT AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT THEY'RE AN ECONOMIC MIGRANT I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES THAT CHANCE TO SAY WHAT THEIR STORY IS AND WHAT THEY'RE FLYING FROM
I MET A GROUP OF PAKISTANI MANY MORAY DETENTION CENTRE THE OTHER DAY AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE FLAME BECAUSE THEY FEARED FOR THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING PERSECUTED BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT EVERYONE COMING FROM PAKISTAN IS AN ECONOMIC MIGRANT
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AND SAY THE CHILDREN HE BELIEVES THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE RIOTS SIX TIME ASYLUM AND HAS THE CASE FAIRLY
WE'RE ALSO PULLING OUTFIT ARE YOU LADIES TO MAKE IT LEGAL AND SAFE PATHWAYS THAT SOAP THE PEOPLE AND RISKING THEIR LIVES COMING ACROSS THE OCEAN TO
WHEN YOU SAY LEGAL AND SAFE PATHWAYS AS IT SAVE THE CHILDREN'S VIEW THERE THAT ANYONE WHO SAYS
MY LIFE IS DESPERATE I AM MISERABLE I WANT TO MAKE A NEW START IN EUROPE THAT ANYONE WHO SAYS THAT SHOULD COME
WHAT I'M HEARING FROM PEOPLE AND THEIR STORIES THEY'RE TELLING ME
THEY ARE FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES YOU KNOW I SPOKE WITH A SYRIAN FAMILY YESTERDAY A FAMILY OF FOUR
AND THE HOUSE RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THEM WAS HIS BOND AND DESTROYED AND THEIR SONS WERE BEING TOLD THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO JOIN TO FIRE
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE AND EVERYONE DESERVES THE RICE TO FIND SAFETY IF THEIR LIVES ARE IN DANGER CUSTER'S CHRIS IN AUGUST YOU AGREE THERE'S NO BUT THERE MIGHT BE
BUMPING PLEASE ALL RIGHT WELL WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS LATER ON TODAY AS I WAS SAYING ONE BONE ALREADY LEFT AND ANOTHER DUE TO GO NOT NECESSARILY WITH SYRIANS ON BOARD YET THOUGH SASHA MYERS AND COST US SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL THANKS VERY MUCH NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE
JUNIOR DOCTORS HAVE FINISHED THEIR LATER STRIKE THE NEXT ONE WILL BE AN ALL OUT STRIKE THEY WON'T EVEN BE COVERING EMERGENCIES AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED JUST THAT THERE WILL BE NO NEW TALKS WELL I'M JOINED BY DOCTOR JOHAN MARIJUANA THE CHAIR OF THE B.M.A. JUNIOR DOCTORS COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO CARRY ON WITH THE SLIGHT IT'S HEARD A LOT ABOUT GOVERNMENT IS GIVEN THAT WE'RE IN ON PRESTON TO TORRINGTON THIS IS BECAUSE THIS GOVERNMENT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FIRST WALK UP TO JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THEY'D SIMPLY REFUSING TO ENGAGE WITH JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THE BERRY WELL DONE IT'S NOT THE DOCTOR'S GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS YOU YOU'RE DOING IT TO DOCTORS YOU'RE THE ONE WALKING OUT
A CHORUS OF VOICES TALKING ABOUT WHAT PROBLEMS WOULD BE ELECTRIC BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TRY AND TALK TO JUNIOR DOT WASN'T HE HAD TALKED TO YOU HAVEN'T THEY AND THEY'VE GOT SORT ALL THOSE VOICES THAT YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE PLENTY OF VOICES FOR HADN'T SAID TAKE DOCTORS DON'T WANT TO WORK ON WEEKENDS WE WORK ON WEEKENDS LIKE OTHER DOCTORS WORK ON AGAIN AND YOU DON'T KNOW DO YOU KNOW WE WORK ON BECAUSE I'M AN OBSTETRICIAN I DELIVER BABIES WITH A RICH PROPERTY PEOPLE
LITTLE CLOSES AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE PRIVATE OPERATE DIFFERENTLY AND THAT'S THE POINT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THEY GAVE US
THEY'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE ALL RIGHT JUST BE CAREFUL EXECUTION RATHER RATHER THAN RE RUNS OUT AND PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT SYMPATHETIC TO YOU BUT ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU'LL BE STANDING OUTSIDE A HOSPITAL MAYBE
AND SOMEBODY COMES OUT OF THAT HOSPITAL THIS IS DURING YOUR ALL OUT STRIKE SOMEBODY COMES OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ANOTHER PERHAPS AND SAYS
MY CHILD HAS JUST DIED IT MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU THE DOCTOR'S THE JUNIOR DOCTORS HAD BEEN THERE CAN YOU REALLY HONESTLY FACE THAT
SO THAT'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION THERE WILL BE EMERGENCY COVER IN HOSPITALS ON THE DAYS OF DOCTOR DOCTORS ARE NECESSARY IN HOSPITALS
SO YOU WERE TRULY BELIEVE THAT NOTHING CAN HAPPEN IN A HOSPITAL THAT MIGHT REQUIRE NOT JUST THE SENIOR DOCTORS BUT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS AS WELL IN AN EMERGENCY OTHER WORDS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO US IS JUNIOR DOCTORS I'D FRIGHTFULLY IMPORTANT AFTER ALL THAT YOU MANAGED PERFECTLY WELL WITHOUT US THE REALITY IS WE CAN'T MANAGE WITHOUT YOU WE NEED YOU OR MY QUESTION REMAINS WHAT WILL YOU SAY TO THAT MOTHER
CAN I ASK YOU WHAT YOU'LL SAY TO THAT MOTHER IT'S A TERRIBLE THING IT'S FULL OF ACTION IT WE WOULD REGRET WE DON'T WE REGRET AT THE ACTION WE'VE TAKEN OPEN SO YOU'RE SO SORRY NO WAY THAT WE WANT TO BE IN THIS SITUATION HOWEVER THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CENTRALLY NOT WILLING TO ACTUALLY BEEN ENGAGED TO THE DOCTOR YOU SAW SINEW TO TAKE AN ALL OUT STRIKE AT THOSE THAT IS CLEARLY ENOUGH TO BE FAIR BECAUSE THEY POSED IN A CONTRACT IN AWKWARD A GENERATION OF DOCTORS WILL CHALLENGE THE DOG
PROBLEMS ARE GOING TO SAY YES
THIS IS AT ALL RIGHT DOCTOR WELL AND COAT GOAT GO GO TO COURT AND CHALLENGE IT IF YOU MUST TELL US AS IT DOES YOU INDEED ARE DOING BUT LET ME TRY ONCE AGAIN JUST TO ASK YOU WHAT IS
WHAT YOU WILL SEE TO THAT MOTHER WHO'S LOST A CHILD AND SHE IS CONVINCED THAT PERHAPS PERHAPS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED IF THE HOSPITAL HAD BEEN PROPERLY STAFFED DURING AN EMERGENCY WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM THERE IS IN THAT SITUATION COS I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE COUNTRY INDEED IN A DAY IN DAY OUT BAKED EXACTLY THAT'S WHAT WE ALL READY TO SITUATION WHAT HOSPITAL DOES NOT STOP I'M WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT MOTHER UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
WE'VE NEVER HAD AN ALL OUT STRIKE BEFORE
WE DON'T I HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUNG MOTHERS LIKE THAT EVERY DAY OF YES THAT'S MY POINT PRECISELY YOU ARE THERE TO DEAL WITH THEM YOU CAN'T YOU'RE CALLING ON ALL OUT STRIKE AND YOU WILL NOT BE THERE TO DEAL WITH THEM WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS HOW YOU ANSWER HER WHEN SHE SAID THAT YOUR BEAUTIFUL PREVENTED MY MY CHILD AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT EVERY DAY WE FACE IS ALWAYS APOLOGISE FOR THIS BUT THE POINT APOLOGISE
THAT DOESN'T HAVE GOT MY ALL OUT STRIKE OR NOT DON'T YOU WE ONLY HAD A COUPLE ACTUALLY TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS REFUSING TO ENGAGE WITH NOBODY FORCING HER TO STAGE AN ALL OUT STRIKE
OH WHAT ABOUT A RESPONSIBLE DOCTORS WHAT ABOUT RESPONSIBLE DOCTORS YOU TALK ABOUT RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT YOU'RE A RESPONSIBLE DOCTOR AND YOU ARE PROPOSING TO STAGE AN ALL OUT STRIKE WON'T WITH EMERGENCIES COULD NEVER HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY BEFORE THE RESPONSIBLE DOCTOR WHAT WE'VE DONE IS INSTEAD OF THE USUAL WHAT IT INTO LIKE SHE TAKES WHICH IS SEVEN DAYS' NOTICE WE'VE GIVEN BUT EVERY TRIP SIX WEEKS LATER WE'VE GOT SOME CONSULTANT SPECIALIST
THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DO
DOCTOR MARLOWE ONE THANKS VERY MUCH IT IS TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE WHAT A PANAMA LEAKS AND OTHER DATA DRIVEN SCOOPS DO TO JOURNALISM DOES IT STRENGTHEN ALL WEAKEN THE WORK DONE BY PEOPLE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON KEEPING POWERFUL ORGANISATIONS AND PEOPLE HONEST
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO SEYMOUR HERSH THEY VETERAN AWARD WINGING U.S. INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST AND JAMES BALL AS WELL IS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT FROM BUZZ FEED HE IS A FORMER DATA JOURNALIST OF THE GUARDIAN AND A WIKILEAKS STAFF MEMBER HE STARTED BY TELLING ME WHAT IS DIFFERENT IN THE NEW WORLD OF JOURNALISM OUT WHAT REMAINS THE SAME
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT MOST OF THE BIG STORIES OF THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT HAVE STARTED FROM JOURNALISTS RATHER THAN WORLD EVENTS THEY'VE COME FROM LAKES AND THEY'VE COME FROM DATA WEATHER FROM WIKILEAKS OFF FROM SNOWDON SO I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF A NEW PHENOMENON BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF HOW WE ALL COME TO LOOK AT IT IT'S STILL GOT TO BE MADE HUMAN IT STILL GOT TO BE MADE INTERESTING SO GOT TO BE VERY DIGESTIBLE WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN HASN'T CHANGED BUT MAYBE HOW WE GET THERE DO YOU AGREE
THERE'S NO QUESTION WE'RE IN A NEW WORLD PARTICULARLY AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD SNOWDON LOOK HOW MUCH HE CHANGED THINGS BUT WHAT MAKES ME SAD IS AS A JOURNALIST AS THAT WE HAVE ENDED UP BEING SO DEPENDENT ON LEEKS IN A WAY IT'S ONLY DOCUMENTS MATTER THE STANDARD IS SO HIGH THESE DAYS I THINK THE GOVERNMENT
CERTAINLY IN AMERICA THE PRESIDENCY HIS NOSE SO MUCH MORE ABOUT HOW TO MANIPULATE THE PRESS AND PUNISH THE PRESS FOR THINGS IT WORRIES ME HOW MANY PEOPLE KNEW WHAT'S INSIDE THE ENNIS EH THIS THIRTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THERE IN THIRTY THOUSAND CONTRACT IS HOW MANY KNEW THAT THE DAY AFTER NINE ELEVEN THAT FATEFUL DAY BUT FOR FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO HOW MANY DO THAT ALL THE RESTRICTIONS ARE MONITORING AMERICANS WERE DRY
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND HERE WE HAVE ONE MAN TWELVE YEARS LATER TELL US
HE'S PUNISHED SHE'S OFTEN RUSSIA NOW IT'S NOT A GREAT INCENTIVE TO FOR MORE PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD I IT JUST THE WHOLE THRUST OF EVERYTHING WORRIES ME I THINK THAT WE SEE IN BE WHERE LEAN FURTHER NEXT WEEK BEFORE WE GO AFTER STORIES IT'S SAFER TO DO SO
JAMES DO YOU AGREE WE'RE TOO LATE DRIVEN I THINK WE'VE GOT A LOT OF LAKES AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN AND THAT'S A POSITIVE THING BUT I THINK TO SAY OLD SHOE LEATHER REPORTING ISN'T HAPPENING WOULD BE SORT OF UNTRUE MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE U.S. DRONE PROGRAMME HAS COME THROUGH TRADITIONAL SORT OF SAUCERS HAS COME THROUGH LOCAL JOURNALISTS ON THE GROUND AND INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS IN THE U.K. AND THEN ACTUALLY
EVEN NEW DATA JOURNALISM TECHNIQUES COULD BRING THAT IN BECAUSE OF COURSE IN MY HOUSE YOU DO STILL NEED TO TELL A STORY DON'T YOU AND THAT STILL INVOLVES A LOT OF JOURNALISTIC NOW IF YOU JUST PUT THE STUFF OUT THERE IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE HER HAIR INTO OFF AND IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE HER HAIR AND YOU KNOW I I'M IN THE POSITION OF COURSE MY COLLEAGUE IS RIGHT THAT A LOT OF GOOD STUFF HAS BEEN DONE I JUST HAPPENED THE WONDER WHAT ELSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE DO WE NOT KNOW ABOUT ABOUT DROWNS OUT IT SEEMS TO ME
LOOK THE WHOLE REASON PEOPLE GO TO JOURNALISM IS BECAUSE A LOT OF US THINK THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE WORLD THESE DAYS EITHER MAD HATTERS OR CRIMINALS
OR ARE THERE BASICALLY NOT REALLY CARBON ENOUGH TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT'S THEY RHYME SO THAT'S A FUNCTION A FUNCTION IS THE SORT OF BE THE THE BEE THE GUIDE IT ALWAYS STICKS THAT FINGER IN THE EYE AND I JUST SEE A PASSIVE THIS COMING IN IT JUST SADDENS ME THAT A STORY ABOUT PARENT AS WONDERFUL AS IT IS AND AS WELL REPORTED AS THAT WAS IT SADDENS ME THAT
WE ALL WE CAN SEE IN THE SUNDAY NEW YORK TIMES EVERY DAY WHEN YOU OPEN UP THE MAGAZINE EVERY AIR IT'S ABOUT THOSE GOING UP THERE BEGIN A TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR A ONE BEDROOM CONDO IN A NEW BUILDING SOMETHING'S GOING ON WITH MONEY AROUND THE WORLD A LOT OF MONEY IS BEING ESCAPING TAXATION OF BEING IF NOT CRIMINALLY SOMETHING UNETHICALLY AND IT'S A BIG STORY JUST MAKES ME SAD THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE LEAGUE TO GET TO IT
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE PUBLIC DEMAND MORE PROOF THAT CAN BE A GOOD THING AS HAVING TO SHOW EVIDENCE AS HAVING TO ALL FOLLOW QUITE HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS
IT'S GOOD IT MEANS SORT OF SOME OF THE EXCESSES IN THE PAST DON'T HAPPEN BUT OF COURSE IT'S GOT ITS DOWNSIDES AS WELL AND WELL YOUR BUZZ FEEDER WHAT THE OTHER BABY SEA YOU'VE GOT TO WORK OUT HOW TO DO STUFF THAT PEOPLE TRUST AND THAT PEOPLE WILL READ SEYMOUR HERSH FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND IT IS A PARTICULAR ISSUE IN AMERICA ISN'T IT THE PEOPLE KIND OF
CHOOSE THEIR OWN FACTS ALMOST IN A WAY THAT PERHAPS THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO DO YOU SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM OF COURSE IT IS IT IS A TRADE OFF THOSE CERTAINLY SOCIAL MEDIA IS A PROBLEM TWO PEOPLE WALK BY THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AFTER DRINKING ON SATURDAY AND THEY GO BY THE WAY THEY SEE LIGHTS SIGN IN THE WINDOW AND THEY HAD TO EAT IT AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THERE IS A CRISIS WHY WERE ALLY SIGN IN THE WINDOW OF THE WHITE HOUSE AT THREE O'CLOCK ON A SUNDAY MORNING AND SO THERE YOU HAVE A WAVE OF TWEAKING GOING ON AND ALL HAD STUFF THERE TO DANGEROUS THAT
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHY A MEDIA CAN BE BETTER HE'S ALWAYS CAN BE BETTER I'LL TAKE
THE RISK OF GOING WITH THE MEDIA TAKING FAR MORE THAN I WOULD TRUST THE GOVERNMENT'S I BASICALLY THINK GOVERNMENTS NOW ABSOLUTELY FEEL THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIE BUT THEY'RE MUCH BETTER AT DOING IT I JUST HAPPEN TO BE SOMEBODY WHO SPENT FIFTY YEARS DOING US I TRUST MY PROFESSION I RUN ACROSS VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT WERE REALLY DESTROY THING SORT OF COURSE I I WORK FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE NEW YORKER AND THINGS LIKE THAT GOOD MAGAZINES
BUT WHEN IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD IT'S A LOT BETTER I THINK THAN THE GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF INTEGRITY SEEMA HIRSCH AND JAMES BALL AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
FIVE DENY AND ENDURING DREAM SPACE EXPLORATION REAL SPACE EXPLORATION WAY BEYOND ANYTHING WE HAVE MANAGED SO FAR BUT HOW DO WE GET THE STUFF WE NEED INTO SPACE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN FUEL WATER BUILDING MATERIALS WILL LADY THE ARTERIES WE DON'T WE USE WHAT IS THERE ANYWAY THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED AT THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY CONFIDENCE TODAY AND I'M JOINED BY PROFESSOR IAN CRAWFORD PROFESSOR OF PLANETARY SCIENCE AT BIRKBECK COLLEGE WHO'S BEHIND THE CONFERENCE AND HOOPER
SHE MUST HAVE THAT WHO IS A P.H.D. A RESEARCHER AT THE OPEN UNIVERSITY RESEARCHING SPACE ARCHITECTURE SO THE POINT OF THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO START BEYOND OF THE EARTH'S REALLY WE'VE BECAUSE GRAVITY IS THE BIG KILLER SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BUILD SPACE STATIONS IT'S GOT TO BE ON THE MOON
YES I'M NOT ONLY SPACE STATIONS ON THE MOOD I'M IN THE NEXT THE NEXT GENERATION OF REALLY LARGE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS LARGE SPACE TELESCOPES FOR EXAMPLE OR AMBITIOUS SPACE MISSIONS TO THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM AND BASES ON THE MOON AND MARS ALL OF THESE THINGS WOULD BE SCIENTIFICALLY VERY ENABLING
BUT THEY'LL ALL BE TREMENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE IF WE HAVE TO LAUNCH EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED FROM THE EARTH INTO INTO SPACE AND SO THE IDEA IS TO USE RESOURCES INSIST THAT WE FIND IN SPACE
IT'S LIKE LIVING OFF THE LAND IF YOU LIKE TO SAY MAKE THE MAKE MAKE THESE SPACE ACTIVITIES AFFORDABLE AND THE AIM OF A CONFERENCE TODAY IS TO TRY AND GET THE SPACE INDUSTRY PEOPLE TALKING TO THE SCIENTISTS TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THE SYNERGIES THAT WE HAVE THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY WILL HAVE WITH THE THE NEW SPACE COMMERCIAL PEEP IS THE STUFF OUT THERE OH YES ABSOLUTELY I DO EVERY ELEMENT IN THE PERIODIC TABLE EXISTS
OUT IN SPACE ON A IT'S JUST NOT ALL ON THE MINISTER'S IT DOES ON THE EARTH NO NO NOT ON THE MOON AND INDEED DIFFERENT PLANETS CONCENTRATE DIFFERENT MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT PLACES SO THERE'S A LOT OF GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION PROSPECTING TO BE DONE FINDING WHERE ON THE MOON OR WEAR ON ASTEROIDS THE RIGHT MATERIALS AND THEN THEY CAN BE UTILISED TO HELP DEVELOP
FUTURE SPACE EXPLORATION SO THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MEETING AND ONE OF THE FASCINATING THINGS IS THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IF YOU WIN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
PRINTING THREE D. PRINTING OF WIT AND BEING ABLE TO CREATE THINGS FROM THIS THREE.D. PRINTER I'M STRUGGLING TERRIBLY TO GET MY HEAD AROUND THAT AND ACTUALLY THREE.D. PRINTING IS A TECHNIQUE WHICH IS ALSO COMMONLY KNOWN AS OUT OF MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUE SO BASICALLY THE KINDS OF BESAN
BUILDING IN A STRUCTURED BY ADDING THE WRONG MATERIAL LAYER BY LAYER AND USING SOME KIND OF HEAT SO AS TO BIND THE LAYERS AND IT HAS IT IS USED EXTENSIVELY FUN TERRESTRIAL APPLICATIONS IN THE RESTAURANT APPLICATIONS ON OUR PLANET AND WE PLAN TO USE THE LUNAR REGOLITH
IN SIMPLE TERMS A LUNAR REGULAR REGULARS REGULAR IS BASICALLY ANY LOOS HETEROGENEOUS MATERIAL THAT IS FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE SOIL YEAH GAVIN WAS ON A DRUGS AT LUNAR SOIL ILONA SIGNED BASICALLY AND THEN ME THEN YOU KNOW THAT THE CONSTRUCTION ON A PLANET USE A CEMENT USUALLY AND CEMENT IS COMPOSED OF A CHEMICAL COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS LIKE SILICON ALUMINIUM IRON ANOTHER ENGLISH ALL OF WHICH ARE IN THAT YES ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ALSO PRESENT
ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON THERE ARE MANY ABUNDANT SILICATE MINERALS I MOURN AND DOES THE LUNAR SOIL BECOMES A VERY GOOD FEED STARK FOR PRINTING STRUCTURES DON'T YOU HAVE TO GET
ONE OF THESE MASSIVE PRINTERS THERE TO START WITH VERY PRINTERS THERE TO START WITH WELL THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ENGLISH I'M LOOKING AND TRYING TO RESEARCH UPON ON WHEN WE USE SWEETLY PRINTERS WE NEED USUALLY THE THREE.D. PRINTERS TO BE BIGGER THAN THE STRUCTURES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SEEMS LOGICAL YEAH BUT WE ARE TRYING SO THAT WE CAN TAKE SMALL PRINTERS WHICH WOULD BE LIKE ROBOTS AND THEY CAN TRAVEL AROUND THEY CAN CARRY THE REGOLITH TO THE PLACE WHERE WE WANT TO CONSTRUCT STRUCTURES BUT THE REGOLITH LAY THEM LAYER BY LAYER
ADD A BINDER I PUT A HEAT SOURCE AND THEN FABRICATE YOU'D END UP WITH THIS WONDERFUL TELESCOPE OR WHATEVER I DO OF LUNAR BASES ARE LANDING LAUNCHING PADS RIGHT ANYTHING RIGHT NOW YOU'RE NODDING YOUR HEAD AT THAT SO GIVE US AN IDEA IF YOU CAN LOOK INTO THE FUTURE HOW ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TEN YEARS OF FIFTY YEARS A CENTURY AWAY THIS SORT OF THING
WELL YOU'VE GOT TO START NOW I HAVEN'T YOU'VE GOT TO START START WHERE WE ARE AND I THINK THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE A LOT OF COMPANIES STARTING UP NOW TO TRY AND SEE WHETHER THEY CAN TURN A PROFIT BY MINING MATERIALS INSPECTS NEARLY AND THAT THEY'RE JUST STARTING UP RIGHT BUT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED PLACES ON THE MOON THEY'VE IDENTIFIED ASTEROIDS THEY BELIEVE WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE FROM A PROMINENT FROM A COMMERCIAL POINT OF VIEW AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO GET THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TALKING TO THESE GUYS SO THAT WE CAN EVOLVE TANNED I MEAN THEY NEED SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
TO BE TOLD WHERE TO MIND THEIR MATERIALS SCIENCE CAN BENEFIT FROM THE THINGS THEY MAY YOU'RE ACTUALLY TALKING TO HIM FOR STRESSED SERIOUS INDUSTRIOUS ABOUT MINING ON THE MOON YES INDEED SO WHEN SO WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWENTY CENTS LEFT OFF WHEN COULD THIS STARTER SO IT'S EARLY DAYS BUT IT COULD START TO HAPPEN WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE OR THE NEXT THE NEXT FEW YEARS BRILLIANT OF COURSE IT WILL BUILD UP OVER THE NEXT COMING DECADES AS A SPACE ECONOMY GRADUALLY EVOLVE WITHIN A GENERATION LIVING TODAY
WE'RE GOING TO CRACK IT WELL I HOPE SO WELL THERE WE ARE ON THAT HOPEFUL NOTE WE'LL END IT PROFESSOR IAIN CRAWFORD AND SHOULD TRAVERSED OF HER THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THEY ALAN TRACY RUBINSTEIN WERE EDITORS FROM JOHN AND ME GOODBYE
