BUT EVERYBODY IS DETERMINED TO MOVE AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THIS THIS WILL APPLY TO ANY AND ALL PARTIES IN SYRIA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS DASH AND ALNESS RIGHT AND ANY OTHER TERRORIST ORGANISATION DESIGNATED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL
SOME LEADING N.H.S. CHIEF EXECUTIVES HAVE DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT ON JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND THEY SAY THEIR PAY OFFER IS FAIR BUT THEY DON'T SUPPORT FORCING THE CONTRACT ON THEM MORE FROM OUR HEALTH EDITOR HUGH PYM

LARGE EMPLOYERS THAT FAIL TO DEAL WITH THE GENDER PAY GAP COULD BE NAMED A NEW GOVERNMENT LEAGUE TABLES THE MOVE IS AMONG A SERIES OF MEASURES AIMED AT TACKLING THE INEQUALITY LATEST FIGURES SHOW THAT WOMEN IN THE U.K. ON AVERAGE TWENTY PERCENT LESS THAN MEN

A STUDY SUGGESTS MANY TEACHERS BELIEVE TESTING CHILDREN AS THEY START PRIMARY SCHOOL IS DISRUPTIVE AND AN UNRELIABLE MEANS OF MEASURING SCHOOL PERFORMANCE SOME SCHOOLS HAVE PILOTED THE ASSESSMENTS OF FOUR AND FIVE YEAR OLDS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE WIDELY ADOPTED FROM SEPTEMBER HERE'S OUR EDUCATION EDITOR BRUNNERA JEFFERIES
THE N.U.T. AND DAY TO YELL UNIONS SAY THE SYSTEM IS MODELLED WITH THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ASSESSMENTS BEING PILOTED MOST SCHOOLS HAVE CHOSEN ONE BASED ON OBSERVATION THE UNIONS ALSO SAY THE RESULTS ARE CRUDE AS THEY RELY ON DECIDING WHETHER A CHILD CAN OR CAN'T DO SOMETHING ON A GIVEN DAY
NONE OF THIS IS LIKELY TO DETER MINISTERS WHO ARGUE THEY DON'T WANT TO OVER TEST CHILDREN BUT DO NEED TO MAKE SURE NONE FAILED TO MASTER BASIC SKILLS WALES ALREADY HAS BASELINE TESTING AND SCOTLAND IS REINTRODUCING NATIONAL TESTS IN PRIMARY SCHOOL

THANK YOU VERY MUCH EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A FIRST LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE FRONT PAGES OF SEVERAL OF THEM REFLECTING THE TURMOIL ON GLOBAL MARKETS AND THE F. TWO YOU AS YOU WOULD EXPECT LEADING WITH THAT GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS DURING A DAY OF TURMOIL YESTERDAY INVESTORS FEARING THERE'S RISING EVER COS THE BANKS HAVE NEGATIVE BORROWING RATES IMPOSED HIGH CENTRAL BANKS AS THEY THEN DESPERATE TO STIMULATE FLAGGING ECONOMIES AND ON ITS FRONT PAGE
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT'S GOING ON THE F. T. SAYS THE SENSE THAT CENTRAL BANKS CAN NO LONGER BE RELIED ON AS THE ULTIMATE BACKSTOP FOR THE SYSTEMS HELP TRIP MARKETS INTO SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC THE GREATEST RISK THEY NOW FACE IS WHAT GEORGE SOROS CALLS RESNICK REFLEX SENILITY THAT MARKETS CREATE THEIR OWN REALITY AND FUR FORCED FURTHER FALLS FOR ASSET PRICES AND A DECLINE
IN WHAT WE MIGHT KNOW AS THE REAL ECONOMY ECONOMIC GROWTH ALL THE PAPERS GIVE A LOT OF SPACE TO THE STORY THAT MAKES THE FRONT PAGE OF THE INDEPENDENT IN FACT THE INDEPENDENT PLAYS IT STRAIGHT IT'S GOT A LOVELY PICTURE OF WHAT THE PICTURE THAT SHOWS A GRAVITATIONAL RIPPLES EXIST AND IT SAYS THEY WERE FIRST PREDICTED BY EINSTEIN A CENTURY AGO YESTERDAY IT WAS REVEALED
THEY'VE FINALLY BEEN DETECTED FROM TWO MASSIVE BLACK HOLES COLLIDING ONE POINT THREE BILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY THE CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD OF PAPERS OR TRY AND FIND SOMETHING CLEVER TO SAY THEIR HEADLINES TO TIMES BLACK HOLE PROVES EINSTEIN'S THEORY RACKETS AND IT'S ABOUT TIME CLOSE BRACKETS
OF TEA FAIRLY STRAIGHT HUGE EXPLOSION IN A GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY CONFIRMED EINSTEIN SPACE TIME THEORY AND THE GUARDIAN SO IT TURNS OUT EINSTEIN WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG THE THEN EMAILS AS DUCHESS OF YORK IN FACT SEVERAL PAPERS HAVE THIS MALE HAS A BIGGER STORY THAN SOME OF THE OTHERS DUTCH AS A YORK MOVING TO SWITZERLAND PERMANENTLY SHE'S GOING TO BECOME A PERMANENT SWISS RESIDENT SHE CLAIMS THE PAPER SAYS SHE FEELS FREE EM HAPPY THERE
FERGIE SAID HER VIEWS ON THE ALPINE COUNTRY AS HER HOME WERE VERY POSITIVE SHE GUSHED THE PAPER SAYS ABOUT ITS POSITIVE ENERGY AND CUISINE NO MENTION THE MAIL SAYS THEY HAVE SWITZERLAND GENEROUS TAX REGIME MORE THE FACT THAT THE MOVE COULD HELP AND TO HER PROPERTY PORTFOLIO THAT SHE BEGAN WITH HER EX HUSBAND PRINCE
THE TIME IS NOW TEN PAST SIX WHAT MAY TURN OUT TO BE THE BIG STORY IS NOT IN THE EARLY EDITIONS OF THE PAPERS AT LEAST BECAUSE THE ANNOUNCEMENT WASN'T MADE UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT THAT IS A GROUP OF SEVENTEEN FOREIGN MINISTERS AGREEING ON MEASURES THAT COULD BRING AN END TO FIGHTING IN SYRIA AND WILL ALSO HELP EASE THE TERRIBLE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THEY'RE A REPORTER LENA SOON JAB IS ON THE LINE SEVENTEEN FOREIGN MINISTERS MOST IMPORTANTLY INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE ANNOUNCEMENT COME WIDER BOMBARDMENT
WASH A BASICALLY SAID THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE
A MONSTER THE OUTCRY AGAINST US
THE RUSSIANS A BIG TALL THAN BY MANY PEOPLE ARE UNDERGROUND AT THEY WERE TARGETING EVERYONE
LEFT ALL OUR CAR DID I AS THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN
AND PUBLICLY EITHER A ME BIKE GROUPS THAT WERE BACKED BY THE U.S.
IF YOU FIRE WOULD BE INSTRUMENTED THAT WHEN
NOT COMMITTED TO IT UNDERGROUND NONETHELESS THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE SAT DOWN AND AGREED ON ANYTHING ALL OF THEM IS SIGNIFICANT ISN'T IT
WELL THEY DID THEIR AGREED TO START THE PEACE TALKS AND I'D BE NO LOSS
THE U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
THEY'RE INCREDIBLY FINE LIKE IN AREAS IN NORTHERN AREA AND ALAN
AND COUPLE OF BREATH THE PRESIDENT CHARLES A BLOODIED THEY WEPT I DO YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW A FIGHTER BUT
WHERE IT WAS OPPOSITION HELD THEIR AREAS THERE WERE NO ISLAMIC BIKERS THERE THEY WERE
IS THAT YOUR THING LINED AT THE GOVERNMENT DESCRIBE ABOUT THE OPPOSITION AND ALMOST EVERYONE WHO HELD THEIR ARM THEY CALL A GOING ENEMY THEY CALL OUR CLARICE BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIND A BID
MANY AGREEMENTS IN THE A FEW FIRE EVEN FOR THREE DAYS THE DURING THE FINAL BRAINY OR
POOR DURING THE TIME OF EDDIE'S
PLACED NONE WERE IMPLEMENTED WITH PITY AND GOVERNMENT PRESSING ACTIVE MORE
YOU'D BE NONE THE WORSE WELL APART FROM THAT AS WELL AS THAT I SUPPOSE I SHOULD SAY THERE IS A FAIRLY BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND A BIT OF GOOD NEWS ON THE HUMANITARIAN AID FRONT
IT'LL ONLY BE GOOD ONE ONE WE IMPLEMENTED ONE WHIPPY
WITHOUT A RIDING INTO A FEW YEAH THEY WERE
YOU'VE GOT THE REVOLUTION TALKING ABOUT ALLOWING A CROSS
COULD BE A LOUSY INTO AREAS THAT ARE BIG
IT WOULD BE A FEW MEANT THAT RIDING BUT NOT ENOUGH TO FEED THE FAMILIES WE WERE YET ABOUT MY BUM YOU GOT ONE EACH WORK WHAT WHAT YOU'LL USE A IN HER IF YOU WANT
PROBLEM IS IF YOU'RE IN THE POLICY THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS USING AND THE POLITICS OF WAR THAT'S OF YOUR FEUD
AREAS WHERE THERE ARE GOVERNMENT PLOY LAPEL
THAT IF YOU BUY THE REBEL
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS DROPPING BOARDS FROM THE AIR
WE NEED TO FEED THEY'VE BEEN CONNECTED IN FULL FLEDGED BASES ON TORTURE MANY THANKS
IT IS FORTY MINUTES PAST SIX LARGE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO PUBLISH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THEY PAY AND MEN AND WOMEN EMMA SIMPSONS OUR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT WHAT DID IT IN DETAIL EMMA WHAT WILL THEY HAVE TO DO IT
WELL THE BROAD THRUST OF THESE MEASURES WERE ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR BY DAVID CAMERON JUST THEN BUT TODAY THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BE SPELLING OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE DETAILS ARE AND WHEN COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO COMPLY
SO INSTEAD OF JUST AN AVERAGE NUMBER FOR THE DIFFERENCE AND PAY AND BONUSES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN COMPANIES WILL ALSO HAVE TO INCLUDE HOW MANY MALE AND FEMALE STAFF THEY HAVE AN EACH PIER RANGE AS WELL AS THE MEDIAN SALARY FIGURE AND DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SENIORITY THERE SISTER TRIED TO GIVE A MORE MEANINGFUL
THAN JUST THE STARK AVERAGE NUMBERS AND COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO PUBLISH THE FIGURES ON THEIR WEBSITES ONCE A YEAR STARTING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG CHANGE FOR THE BIG EMPLOYER
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START GATHERING AND PUBLISHING OR RATHER A LOT OF NEW DATA AND ALSO THERE'S A NEW MEASURE THAT'S GOING TO BE INTRODUCED FOR A LEAGUE TABLE OF COMPANIES DO THEY MIND
I THINK THIS NEW MEASURE FOR A LEAGUE TABLE IS CERTAINLY GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF BUSINESSES NERVOUS INITIALLY THE IDEA IS FOR ONE LEAGUE TABLE TO ALLOW WOMEN TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENCE AND PAY BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPANY
BUT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS COULD BE EXTENDED TO RANKING INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE SECTORS SO THE C.B.I. FOR INSTANCE IS CONCERNED THAT THESE LEAGUE TABLES AS THEY'RE INTRODUCED COULD LEAD TO NAMING AND SHAMING FOR OBVIOUS REASONS COS IF YOU'RE A COMPANY YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THESE LES NO BUT THEN LOOKED OUT FROM THE OTHER POINT OF VIEW FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF WOMEN WHO ARE NOT PAID WHAT THERE SHOULD BE BEING PAID AS MANY WILL THINK IS THE CASE THEN ACTUALLY THIS COULD BE QUITE EFFECTIVE
WELL ABSOLUTELY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE YOU'VE GOT THE T.U.C. SAYING THIS IS A WELCOME STEP BUT ACTUALLY THE PROPOSALS DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH THERE ARE NO SANCTIONS ARE FINDS OF COMPANIES DON'T COMPLY AND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR COMPANIES WITH LARGE PAIR GAPS TO ACT ON THESE RESULTS BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT
THE FAWCETT SOCIETY OF THE CHARITY WHICH CAMPAIGNS FOR WOMEN'S RIGHT SAYING ACTUALLY THIS IS A BIG STEP FORWARD IN THE FIGHT TO CLOSE THE GENDER PYGAR BECAUSE TRANSPARENCY YOU CAN BE QUITE A POWERFUL DRIVER'LL OF CHANGE AND OTHER WORDS THAN MAYBE A FEW PLACES FOR BUSINESSES TO HIDE
MORE ON THIS LATER IN THE PROGRAMME EMMA SIMPSON FOR THE TIME THANKS SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX ROLLS ROYCE OF THE GREAT SYMBOL OF BRITISH ENGINEERING WE ALL SALUTE THAT PARTICULAR FLAG OR AT LEAST WE HAD FOR MANY YEARS JOAN IS GOING THROUGH A DIFFICULT TIME GOING TO GET MORE DIFFICULT TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THE FULL YEAR RESULTS TODAY THEY'VE HAD A VERY
TOMORROW SHE WAS TWO YEARS THEY'VE HAD FIVE PROFIT WARNINGS IN THAT TIME AND THINGS HAVEN'T GONE THEIR WAY AS OIL PRICES HAVE SLID AND HER SERVICES CONTRACTS THAT THEY DEPEND ON
HAVE FALLEN A SOMEWHAT JOHN BOTHAM IS A DIRECTOR AT INVEST GO PERPETUAL ALSO A SHAREHOLDER IN ROLLS ROYCE GOOD MORNING TO YOU JOHN CAN WE START WITH WHAT DO YOU THINK WENT WRONG AT ROLLS ROYCE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS I THINK THEY'VE HAD SOMETHING OF A PERFECT STORM FIRSTLY THEY'RE NON CIVIL AEROSPACE BUSINESSES IN MARINE AND POWER HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY FALLING OIL PRICES SO THAT'S AFFECTED THE BUSINESS AND THE PROFITS THEY CAN GET FROM THOSE AREAS AND SECONDLY SOME OF THE MOST PROFITABLE CIVIL
AEROSPACE PROGRAMMES THEY HAVE OF A HAVE MATURED AND THEIR NEW PROGRAMMES AND NEW EXCITING PROGRAMMES FOR THE BEE THE BOEING SEVEN OH SEVEN AND THE AIRBUS A. THREE FIFTY I JUST RAMPING UP AND WHEN YOU LAUNCHED NEW ENGINES THEY KNOW THEY'RE NOT AS PROFITABLE AS IT HAS ESTABLISHED PROGRAMMES AT THAT TALK TO ME ABOUT THE SERVICE CONTRACT I READ SOME OF THAT ALMOST HALF OF THE REVENUES COMES FROM SERVICE CONTRACT HOW DOES THAT SO BASICALLY THEY SELL YOU AN ENGINE BUT THEY ALSO KIND OF
KEEP A BOLT ON SERVICE STEELS THAT'S RIGHT MAINTENANCE AND SPARE PARTS AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROFITABILITY IN QUITE A LOT OF THE ENGINES THEY WILL THEY WILL SELL WILL BE SOLD AT A LOSS FOR THE ORIGINAL FOR THE ENGINE AS WELL IT'S ORIGINALLY SOLD BUT THEY'LL MAKE THEIR MONEY OVER THERE FIFTEEN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR LIFE THAT THAT THAT ENGINE WILL SPEND ON ON AN AEROPLANE
BUT AIRLINES ARE RETIRING AIRPLANES THAT LITTLE BIT EARLIER THERE HAS BEEN A TREND OF THAT AND AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS AS AFFECTED ROLLS ROYCE OVER THE LAST TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS SOME OF THE ENGINES THEY HAVE ON THEIR BOEING SEVEN SEVENS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN RETIRED EARLY FROM SOME CARRIERS AND ALSO SOME OF THEIR VERY LONG ESTABLISHED ENGINES WITH ON SEVEN FORTY SEVENS FOR EXAMPLE AND SEVEN SIX SEVENS ARE GETTING RETIRED AND
HOW'D WE CAN WE PUT THIS DOWN TO POOR MANAGEMENT IN THE PAST THERE IT DID IT CAME TO THIS I THINK THERE'S CLEARLY I THINK ROLLS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEIR BUSINESS HAS BECOME TOO COMPLEX AND ARGUABLY CHEAPER TOO BUREAUCRATIC AND THAT'S SOMETHING THE NEW MANAGEMENT IS TRYING TO DEAL WITH O.K. THERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH IT AND THE TALKING ABOUT SLASHING MANAGERS
AND THE TONGUE THAT SMASHING ORDINARY STAFF AS WELL WE'VE ALREADY HAD JOB CUTS ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR AROUND THREE THOUSAND DO EXPECT ANY MORE TODAY TO EACH MAKE A DIVIDEND CUT TODAY WHAT D'YOU EXPECT I THINK I THINK I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT WE WILL GET IT OVER AND CUT TODAY I THINK HOW THEY MANAGED THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT THE CEILING THEY GAVE ON THE EIGHT THE OUTLOOK FOR CASH FLOW WITHIN THE BUSINESS AND THE GUIDANCE THEY GIVE WILL BE IMPORTANT AND I THINK YES THEY WILL SEEK TO SIMPLIFY THE BUSINESS AND I CALLED FOR MORE JOB CUTS
WE'LL WAIT AND SEE BUT CLEARLY THEY THEIR PRODUCTIVITY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE AS HIGH AS SOME COMPETITORS IN THE U.S. IT'S A GENIE AND VERY BRIEFLY THEIR MARGINS ARE ALSO BELOW THE RIVALS AS WELL ABSOLUTELY BUT FOR THAT REASON THAT YOU COULD MAKE THE CASE THAT THERE THEY ARE CARRY MORE OVERHEADS THAN SOME OF THEIR CONTRACT O.K. LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR MARKETS WHICH HAVE BEEN
AGAIN TO MULL TO US OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS AND AGAIN YESTERDAY WE SAW THE FOOTY DOWN TWO POINT FOUR PER CENT WE SAW THE DAX DOWN THREE PER CENT AND THE CACK I DOWN FOUR PER CENT WHAT IS GOING ON
I THINK I THINK TO SOME EXTENT WE'VE GOT IT ARRANGE A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHICH AFFECT AFFECTING INVESTORS THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHINA THERE'S CONCERN AT THE U.S. IS RAISED INTEREST RATES AND REALLY THE U.S. ECONOMY ISN'T THAT STRONG AND IS BEGINNING TO SLOW DOWN AND THIS CONCERN OBVIOUSLY THAT FALLING OIL PRICES AFFECTING CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND AN EFFECT IN CREDIT QUALITY FOR FOR OIL PRODUCERS AND ALL OF THOSE FACTORS HAS HAVE COMBINED TO CREATE SOME NERVOUSNESS I THINK WE ARE IN RISK RISK ALLOWING THIS TO FEED ON ITSELF AND ACTUALLY GETTING
A RECESSION I THINK AS SO WE COULD TALK OURSELVES ARE WE I THINK WE COULD TALK OURSELVES I THINK GEORGE SAW US I THINK WHAT DO YOU MENTION USE THE PHRASE REFLECTIVITY WHERE EFFECTIVELY THE MARKETS LEAD THE REAL ECONOMY AND I THINK THERE IS A RISK OF THAT BECAUSE IN MANY OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE ECONOMY ARE IN GOOD SHAPE THE FLIPSIDE OF FALLING OIL PRICES IS THAT REAL INCOMES FOR CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN RISING AND SO PEOPLE HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS AND THAT'S BUT THAT'S IT THAT'S A POSITIVE THING EXPLAIN TO US HOW FALLING MARKETS COULD ACTUALLY FORCE OF RECESSION HOW THAT WOULD WORK
POLISH AND CONFIDENCE THAT PEOPLE SEE YOU SEE ON YOUR SCREENS THE FOOTSIE FALLING EVERY DAY PERHAPS I'LL JUST DEFER A PURCHASE THINGS AREN'T QUITE SO CERTAIN POSSIBLY BECAUSE BANKS SAY THEY'RE FALLING SHARE PRICES AND THE CONCERN ABOUT THEIR FUTURE PROSPECTS SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT LESS RELUCTANT TO MAKE A LOAN AND ASK DEUTSCHE BANK AND SAUSAGE SAUSAGE A GENERAL THE FRENCH GIANT THEY WERE DOWN ALMOST THIRTEEN PERCENT YESTERDAY IS THAT ON THE BASE OF THE FEAR THAT THEY WERE BASICALLY CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY
BECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE SO LOW TO LEND TO ANYONE ELSE HERE THERE'S THIS POD I THINK THERE'S A CONCERN WITH RESOURCES TO GENERAL IN THE BANKS IN GENERAL THAT THEY THE INTEREST MARGINS THERE GOOD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THEY GET ON MONEY THEY LEND YOU AND WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY
TO GIVE YOU ON ON THAT ON DEPOSITS IS SHRINKING ALL THE TIME THEREFORE THEY MAKE LESS LESS PROFIT BUT I THINK THE GENERAL NUMBERS YESTERDAY WERE JUST A REFLECTION OF VOLATILE MARKETS AND NUMBERS WHICH MISSED EXPECTATIONS MARGINALLY THE BOAT SEEMS TO BE VERY GOOD SHAPE SO BRIEFLY IT'S NOT A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MAMA NO IT MIGHT BE MORE OF A TWO THOUSAND ONE MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE THE DOTCOM THING WHICH PEOPLE FEARED MIGHT LEAD TO A MASS OF COLLAPSE BUT DIDN'T
POSSIBLY AGAIN HISTORY NEVER REPEATS ITSELF AT SIMPLY RIDES AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T COMPARE THE SITUATION THAT TWO THOUSAND WON EITHER JOHN BOTHAM THERE FROM INVEST THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MY FRIDAY BOSS THIS MORNING IS JENNY CAMPBELL GOOD MORNING JENNIE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF YOUR CASH THAT OPERATES FIVE THOUSAND A.T.M.S KNOWN AFFECTIONATELY AS HOLES IN THE WALL AND MOSTLY IN THE U.K. BUT ALSO IN BELGIUM IRELAND AND THE NETHERLANDS HAD RUNS THOSE A.T.M.S OR WITHIN RETAIL STORES SO IT CAN'T BE A VICTIM OF SLEDGEHAMMER SLEDGEHAMMER GANGS OR INDEED CARD CLONING FROST WAS GOOD MORNING JENNIE GOOD MORNING
YOU HAVE A PRETTY LONG HISTORY IN BANKING I DO JOE HAS STARTED AS A BANKER AT THE BOTTOM AGED SIXTEEN COUNTING CASH AND FILLING CASH MACHINES AND THOUGHT THAT I WOULD HAVE A FORTY YEAR CAREER IN THE BANK BUT THE WORLD CHANGED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THE PROUD OWNER OF YOUR CASH WHERE I DID A MANAGEMENT BUY OUT FROM THE BANK IN TWO THOUSAND
BUT THE COMPANY HAS NOW CALLED YOUR CASH WAS OWNED BY BESWICK YOU WERE AN EMPLOYEE FOR HER QUITE A FEW YEARS YES WHAT WAS IT LIKE WORKING IN THE BOOM YEARS AN HOUR BZZZ THAT WEST I LOVED EVERY JOB I DID IN THE BANK JOE FROM STARTING AT THE BOTTOM AS A SAY THROUGH TO A CASHIER IN A RELATIONSHIP MANAGER IN A LENDING MANAGER AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO CENTRAL ROLES
IN THE CITY OF LONDON STRATEGIC ROLE STRANGE ROLLS ET-CETERA AND I PARTICULARLY LOVED OR MY FINAL YEARS IF YOU LIKE IT WITHIN THE GROUP COMBINING THAT WEST WITHOUT THE S. BEFORE I WENT ON TO RUN THE SUBSIDIARY COMPANY THEN CALLED HANKER A.T.M.S IN TWO THOUSAND SIX BUT WAS ALIVE WHEN I WAS BUYING UP EVERYTHING IN EVERYTHING AROUND US AND FRED THE SHRED GOODWIN WAS IN CHARGE
FOR ME THOSE WERE PROBABLY THE BEST YEARS OF MY CAREER THERE WAS DEFINITELY A CAN DO ATTITUDE THERE WAS REAL SUPPORT FOR WOMEN PROGRESSING IN THE BANK THERE WAS LOTS TO DO I'M VERY MUCH A COMPLETE A FINISH OUR DELIVERER AND ONCE YOU SHOWED THAT YOU COULD DO A GOOD JOB YOU ARE VERY WELL SUPPORTED IN PURSUING A CAREER YOU MENTIONED WOMEN IN THE INDUSTRY WE HAVE HAD THE ITEM IN THE NEWS ABOUT GENDER PAY GAP REQUIREMENTS AND PAY RANGES AND PRESUME YOU WET YOU WELCOME THAT
I ALWAYS WELCOME ANY DATA JOEY BUT I BUT I WOULD TREAT IT WITH A NOTE OF CAUTION BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE IT DOESN'T BECOME AN OVER GENERALISATION FROM MY RESEARCH OF THE TOPIC ONE I FIND IT A LITTLE BIT SURPRISING BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT I SEE IN MY BUSINESS WHERE I EMPLOY ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE I THINK YOU HAVE TO GET BENEATH THE DATA AS EVER AND THAT SHOWS THAT IT VERY MUCH VARIES BY OCCUPATION SO THE BIGGER GAP IS WHERE THE SKILLED TRADES ARE RATHER THAN SALES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE
AND INDEED THERE WAS DATA LAST YEAR THAT SAID WOMEN IN THEIR TWENTIES ARE ACTUALLY EARNING MORE THAN MEN NOW BUT THAT BEGINS TO REVERSE IN THEIR THIRTIES AND I THIN THEY START HAVING FAMILIES WELL I THINK IT'S IN THE THIRTIES THAT THERE'S THAT AS WELL I ALSO THINK WOMEN MAKE OF THEIR CHOICES ABOUT THEIR AMBITIONS AND THEIR PREFERENCES AND SO ON BUT I ALSO THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF WOMEN PROBABLY AS THEY GET INTO MORE SENIOR ROLES NOT NEGOTIATING QUITE AS HARD AS THE MEN THEY DON'T LEAN IN
THEY DON'T LEAN AND IN MY VIEW IF I'M INTERVIEWING A MAN AND A WOMAN FOR THE SAME JOB AND THERE'S A RANGE ON THAT OR PAY RENT ON THAT JOB THE MAMMAL AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME HE CAN GET THE TOP NUMBER WHERE'S THE LADY WILL OFTEN I WOULD SAY NEGOTIATES FOR SOME OF THE MORE SOFTER PARTS OF THE PACKAGE LIKE FLEXIBILITY ON HOLIDAYS ETCETERA OH KAY LET'S GO BACK TO THE ACTUAL CASH BUSINESS THAT YOU IAN THERE'S QUITE A FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT I'D SAY YOU'RE IN THE WRONG BUSINESS THAT WE'RE HEADING TOWARDS A CASHLESS SOCIETY ARE WE
WELL OF COURSE THAT'S THE HEAD THAT WE WILL RECEIVE EVERY DAY LOOK I'M YES I AM IN THE CASH BUSINESS AND I WOULD SAY CASH IS GOING TO BE HERE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME WOULDN'T I BUT AS A PERSON I'M ALSO VERY MUCH INTO MY GADGETS AND PAYING FOR THINGS ONLINE
AND USING ANY NEW TOP TECHNOLOGY CONTACTLESS ET-CETERA BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT CASH IS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF OUR SOCIETY FOR THE FOR THE OLDER PEOPLE FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE TO APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF MONEY BUT DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW OF ABORIGINAL CASH BECAUSE THE PAYING WITH THEIR APPLE WATCH AND THEN THE PAY WITH A CONTACT SON I'M NOT SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO BE HANDLING CASH AND FUTURE
I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT CHOICE JOE WE DID RESEARCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE LEADING UP TO CHRISTMAS AND OUR MARKET RESEARCH REVEALED THAT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY YEAR OLDS MET PLATE PAY FOR THE MAJORITY OF THEIR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS IN CASH BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BUDGET SO I THINK
THE OTHER PAYMENT METHODS ARE ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT YOU TEND TO GET TO THE END OF THE EVENING I'VE NO IDEA HOW MUCH YOU'VE SPENT SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL AND IT IS OF COURSE CASH DOESN'T BREAK DOWN YOU DON'T NEED A NEW BATTERY IT'S VERY DURABLE ET-CETERA SO I THINK IT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN SOCIETY AND I DO LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS SWEDEN WHERE THEY WOULD SAY THE MOST LEADING COUNTRY IN THE CASHLESS SOCIETY BUT YOU'LL ALSO SEE THAT THEY'RE STILL ISSUING BANK NOTES AND THAT THE SOCIETY IS SAYING IT'S A RAT A HUMAN RIGHT TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO USE CASH
O.K. YOU GUYS ARE MOSTLY IN STORES AND MOSTLY IN BIG RETAILERS AS WELL YES HOW DO YOU MAKE ANY MONEY IF YOU DON'T CHARGE THE CUSTOMER WHO'S WITHDRAWING CASH TO DO SO IT'S THE MOST COMMON QUESTION I GET ASKED OVER DINNER PARTIES ET-CETERA BUT BECAUSE MOST OF MY MOST OF MY FLEECE IS FREE TO USE TO THE END CONSUMER AND THAT'S WHERE WE BELIEVE THE BUSINESS MODEL SHOULD BE BUT THE BANK'S ESSENTIALLY PAY ME FOR PROVIDING THAT SERVICE TO THOSE CLIENTS
AND THEN THAT ALLOWS THEM TO REDUCE THE COSTS IN THEIR OWN FLEET WHICH ARE LESS QUARTER THEM THESE DAYS AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RETAILER IS ALL ABOUT BRINGING THE FOOTFALL INTO YOUR STORE WHICH THEN INCREASES BASKET SPEND AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO RECIRCULATE THE CASH FROM THE TILL THROUGH THE CASH MACHINE DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT IS JENNY CAMEL THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF YOUR CASH THANK YOU THANKS

POLICE SAY THEY HAVE ARRESTED THE PARTNER OF THE FORMER EASTENDERS ACTRESS CYAN BLAKE ON SUSPICION OF HER MURDER THOSE OF HER TWO CHILDREN ARTHUR'S SIMPSON KENT WAS DETAINED AT HEATHROW AIRPORT THIS MORNING AFTER ARRIVING ON A FLIGHT FROM GHANA HE TRAVELLED TO WEST AFRICA SHORTLY AFTER MISS BLAKE AND HER SON ZACHARY AND NAME ON WERE REPORTED MISSING
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN OH DAVID CAMERON WILL MAKE HIS LAST BIG SPEECH BEFORE THE EUROPEAN SUMMIT THIS EVENING BEN WRITES A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AND ANGELA MERKEL WILL BE HIS AUDIENCE BEN WILL SHE BE NODDING ALONG WITH HIM
I IMAGINE SHE WILL AND APPLAUDING IN ARE PROVING WAY THE SETTING WILL BE A GLITTERING BANQUET IN HAMBURG TOWN HALL THIS IS AN ANNUAL DINNER APPARENTLY THAT GOES BACK TO THE MID FOURTEENTH CENTURY AND ANGLER MERKEL OR DAVID CAMERON TALKING THAT LONG BUT THEY HAVE BEEN CONFERRING FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS OVER MEETINGS PHONE CALLS ANGLER MERKEL HEARING WHAT DAVID CAMERON WANTS FROM THIS RENEGOTIATION EXPLAINING
WHAT MIGHT AND MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE SHE IS OF COURSE EUROPE'S MOST POWERFUL LEADER AND A CRITICAL ALLIED TO THE PRIME MINISTER BUT SHE ALONE CAN'T DELIVER THE DEAL OF COURSE THIS HAS TO BE SIGNED OFF BY EVERY TWENTY EIGHT MEMBER STATES AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT BUT HER VOICE IN HER VIEW MATTERS A LOT WILL BE FASCINATING TO SEE WHAT DAVID CAMERON HAS TO SAY TO HIS GERMAN AUDIENCE AN ANGLER MICHAEL SAYS HERSELF BUT PRESUMABLY MY CAMERAMAN THAT WE HAVEN'T ALREADY HEARD
NO VERY UNLIKELY BUT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT SORT OF TONE HE TAKES WILL HE USE IT AS A PLATFORM TO PRESS THE NEED FOR REFORM OR WILL HE PRAYS THE E.U. AND BRITAIN'S PLACE IN IT I MEAN I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY A WILLINGNESS TO HELP DAVID CAMERON IN GERMANY AND I THINK FOR INSTANCE HIS PLANS AROUND REFORM OF WELFARE AS AN EFFORT AS A MEASURE THAT MIGHT CURB MIGRATION SEEMS TO HAVE PRETTY STRONG SUPPORT ACROSS
PARTIES IN GERMANY AND IT'S CLEAR THAT ANGLER MERKEL DESPERATELY WANTS TO HELP DAVID CAMERON SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE PITCHES IT BUT OF COURSE AS I SAID THIS THIS GOES FAR BEYOND GERMANY AND THERE ARE ONLY A FEW DAYS TO GO BEFORE THIS CRITICAL SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS NEXT WEEK DON OR TEST THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL SAID EARLIER IN THE WEEK
BUT THIS POLITICAL PROCESS REMAINED VERY FRAGILE HE'S GOING TO SPEND THE NEXT FEW DAYS SHUTTLING AROUND EUROPEAN CAPITALS TRYING TO SHORE UP SUPPORT AMONG SCEPTICAL LEADERS FOR DAVID CAMERON'S PLANS DIPLOMATS AND OFFICIALS MET HERE IN BRUSSELS YESTERDAY IT SEEMS THEY MADE SOME PROGRESS ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECT OF TALKS
BUT FOR NAILING THIS DOWN GETTING AGREEMENT ON SOME OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS AREAS LIKE HOW THAT SO CALLED EMERGENCY BRAKE ON WELFARE WILL WORK EXACTLY HOW
THE RULES WILL WORK BETWEEN EUROZONE COUNTRIES AND NON EUROZONE AS EUROZONE COUNTRIES IN THE FUTURE THAT LOOKS SET TO BE LEFT TO LEADERS TO CRACK AT THE SUMMIT NEXT WEEK AND THERE IS A FEELING THAT A DEAL THERE'S DEFINITELY WITHIN REACH AND A GENE REFERENDUM COULD FOLLOW BUT THERE IS WORK TO DO
THEN MANY THANKS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF CONDUCTING ASSESSMENTS OF CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF FOUR NOT MUCH SAY THE UNIONS AND THEY HAVE SOME RESEARCH TO HELP THEM IN THEIR CASE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT RAMEN JEFFERS EDUCATION EDITOR AND IN THE RESEARCH SAYS WHAT
WE JUST IN IT DISTILS THE UNEASE AMONGST MANY A RECEPTION CLASS TEACHERS AT WHETHER OR NOT THESE ASSESSMENTS IN THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT KINDS THERE'D HAVE BEEN PILOTED IN SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND DURING THE LAST YEAR A RELIABLE MEASURE OF WHERE A SMALL CHILD IS THAT AS THEY'D START SCHOOL THESE ASSESSMENTS LOOK AT THE CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT THEIR LANGUAGE SKILLS WHETHER THEY CAN RECOGNISE SIMPLE WORDS SIMPLE NUMBERS THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN MEANT TO
ACT AS A BASELINE MEASURE AGAINST WHICH THE SCHOOL WILL BE JUDGED IN COMING YEARS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CHILDREN HAVE MADE PROGRESS AND THE UNIONS ARE BASICALLY SAYING THAT IT'S HIGHLY DISRUPTIVE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A RELIABLE TEST AND ALSO THEY DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR IS THERE ARE THREE SYSTEMS IN PLAY AT THE MOMENT BEING USED BY SCHOOLS
TO JUDGE SCHOOLS AND THAT KIND OF MEASURE WHEN IT'S NOT A CONSISTENT STANDARDISED PLEASURE BUT THIS RESEARCH ISN'T ISN'T ITSELF OBJECTIVE AND IS IT IN THERE IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS IT'S SOUGHT OPINIONS AMONG PEOPLE YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO THINK BELIEVE THIS WASN'T A GOOD THING
AND THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT IT WILL IN ANY WAY TO TEAR THE GOVERNMENT FROM USING THIS AS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE FOR SCHOOLS FROM THIS AUTUMN SOWN ALTHOUGH THIS IS MEANT TO BE VOLUNTARY FOR SCHOOLS TO OPT INTO THE REALITY IS THAT IT IS THE ONLY MEASURE BY WHICH THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE IN FUTURE THAT A CHILD COMING INTO THIS SCHOOL HAS IMPROVED BECAUSE OF WHAT THE SCHOOL'S DONE DURING THEIR TIME THERE BY THE TIME THEY'RE ELEVEN WHAT'S HIS SCHOOLS WILL BE ADOPTING THIS FROM SEPTEMBER WHAT ABOUT THE SORT OF SERIOUS
THE STUFF THEY THEM DO SOME OF THIS IS ANECDOTAL ISN'T THEY'VE GOT TEACHERS TO TO SAY WHY THEY DON'T LIKE THESE TESTS AND THEY'RE SAYING THINGS LIKE WELL ON ONE DAY A FOUR YEAR OLD WILL BE PERFECTLY ABLE ON ANOTHER DAY THEY MIGHT BE INCAPABLE AND THAT MAKES IT LUDICROUS JUST DOESN'T WORK AND ALSO IT'S DISRUPTIVE IT DAMAGED THE RELATIONSHIP WITH A TEACHER IT SAID READ THAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT DISMISSED OR
I THINK THEY ACCEPT THAT THERE IS SOME VARIATION IN THEIR WORRIES AT THIS IS THIS IS MEASURED SO THE TEST THAT HAS BEEN MOST WIDELY ADOPTED CHOSEN BY SCHOOLS IS LARGELY BASED ON OBSERVATION AND THEN THE TEACHER WRITES DOWN THEIR OBSERVATIONS BASED ON WHAT THEY'VE SEEN ON A PARTICULAR DAY OF THAT CHILD
HOWEVER THEY ARE UNWAVERING IN SAYING THAT IT WHETHER IT'S PERFECT OR NOT YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME WAY OF TRYING TO CAPTURE WHERE A CHILD IS AS THEY BEGIN SCHOOL AND INTERESTINGLY WALES FOR EXAMPLE INTRODUCED IT IN SEPTEMBER SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VERSION AGAIN THAT BASELINE TESTING AND SCOTLAND WHICH FOR MANY YEARS HASN'T BEEN TESTING
CHILDREN AND STANDARDISED NATIONAL TESTS IN PRIMARY SCHOOL IS PLANNING TO DO THE SAME SO THE TIDE IS GOING AGAINST THE UNIONS THEY DON'T LIKE IT BUT
IN THE WAY THEY ARE NOW IN THE POSITION OF TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT THEY BELIEVE THE DEFICIENCIES BECAUSE THERE PROBABLY WILL BE SOME MOVEMENT ABOUT HOW EXACTLY THIS OPERATES AS IT COMES IN THAT'S INTERESTING THANKS FOR THAT BRAMAH'S WILL BE TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO'D WHO DOES THESE TESTS AT TEN TO EIGHT AS WELL AS THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS
IT IS NOW TWENTY TO SEVEN THE MACEDONIAN GOVERNMENT STILL THE B. B. C. THAT SIX EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE NOW SEND POLICE OFFICERS TO MACEDONIA THE BORDER WITH GREECE TO HELP STEM THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS TRYING TO REACH WESTERN EUROPE IS GROWING FEAR ABOUT THE TOUGH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE MIGRANTS WHO EXPECTED TO
ARRIVED THIS YEAR WILL SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY CAN ONLY ABSORB LIMITED NUMBERS BECAUSE OF RICHARD GALPIN IS NEAR THE BORDER BETWEEN MACEDONIA AND GREASE IMPORTANT THIS RICHARD THESE EXTRA POLICE OFFICERS GOING THERE
I THINK POTENTIALLY IT IS SIGNIFICANT WAS SO MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SENDING POLICE OFFICERS OFFICERS TO THE MACEDONIAN ORDER AND OF COURSE THE CONTEXT IS THAT THE E. USE URGENTLY TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE MIGRANT CRISIS BUT SO FAR TURKEY'S NOT PLAYING BALL IT'S NOT STOPPING THE REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS SETTING SAIL FOR GREECE FROM IT IN FACT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MIGRANTS HAVE ARRIVED IN GREECE JUST THIS YEAR
AND THEN OF COURSE GREECE IS ACCUSED OF STILL NOT DOING ENOUGH TO REDUCE THE ONWARD FLOW SO THE NEXT COUNTRY ALONG THE MIGRANT NEW ROUTES TO WESTERN EUROPE IS MACEDONIA IN THE GOVERNMENT'S HERE IS WILLING TO TAKE A TOUGH LINE ON MIGRANTS HELPED BY THOSE POLICE FORCES FROM EUROPE I ASKED NICOLE OR POP ASK EITHER MACEDONIAN FOREIGN MINISTER WHICH COUNTRIES WERE INVOLVED
SERBIA CROATIA SLOVENIA HUNGARY CZECH REPUBLIC SLOVAKIA HAVE PROVIDED US BOUGHT WITH MANPOWER SENDING POLICE OFFICERS TO MACEDONIAN BORDER AND ALSO EQUIPMENT FOR REGISTRATION AND FOOTBALL OF SURVEILLANCE
WAS THAT OUR EFFORTS IN THE CRAZING ILLEGAL MIGRATION HE'S MADE IT IN AN EFFICIENT
WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THESE COUNTRIES AND WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT WE CAN HAVE UP TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED POLICE OFFICERS FOR HIM POLICE OFFICERS OPERATING ON OUR SOIL IT'S LIKELY THAT OTHER MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE GOING TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE SAID THIS BOILER
INTRIGUING THE FOREIGN MINISTER ALSO SET HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD CONSIDER HAVING FOREIGN TROOPS STATIONED ON THE MACEDONIAN BORDER WITH GREECE IF THERE WERE TO BE AN OFFER FROM A EUROPEAN COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES BUT SO FAR HE SAID THIS HAD NOT BEEN DISCUSSED BUT MEANWHILE MACEDONIAN TROOPS ARE BUILDING A SECOND RAZOR WIRE FENCE ON THE BORDER TO STOP MIGRANTS CROSSING ILLEGALLY
AND THERE IS JUST ONE LEGAL CROSSING POINT WHICH ALLOWS ONLY SYRIANS IRAQIS AND AFGHANS THROUGH AND THIS CROSSING POINT KEEPS CLOSE THINK NURSE TEARS AMONGST AID WORKERS AND REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS THE BORDER MIGHT BE SEALED OFF COMPLETELY EVENTUALLY I ASKED HE'S SAYING WHO'S FROM IRAQ AND WAS WAITING TO GET THROUGH WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR HIM IF THE BORDER DID CLOSED PERMANENTLY
I THINK YOUR HEAD MEANS THE END OF LIFE THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO YOU GO BACK TO IRAN IRAQ THEY'LL KILL ME I'M SURE OF IT
YOU KILLED MY FRIEND THEY ALL MIGHT IF THEY KILL ME I MEAN WHY MIKE AND JUST IRAQI PRESS ELEVEN A WRAPPING THEY KILL ME
NOW THE MACEDONIAN FOREIGN MINISTER TOLD ME THEY HAD NO PLANS TO SEAL OFF THE BORDER BUT THE U.N. REFUGEE AGENCY IS ALREADY MAKING CONTINGENCY PLANS JUST IN CASE
THERE WE ARE AT THE TIME EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS NOW THE ANNOUNCEMENT THE SCIENTISTS HAVE THEIR FIRST TIME DETECTED GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ALLOWS THE HEADLINE WRITERS TO GO TO TOWN THE TIMES HAS BLACK HOLE PROVES EINSTEIN'S THEORY AND IT'S ABOUT TIME THE GUARDIAN GOES WITH SO TURNS THAT EINSTEIN WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG
ANY MIRROR FEATURES A COMPUTER VISUALISATION IT'S GOT THE HEADLINE EINSTEIN EINSTEIN GIVE US A WAVE AND I'M A MORE POIGNANT NO THE DAILY TELEGRAPH REPORTS THAT THE BRITISH SCIENTIST ROLAND DRAPER FORMER PROFESSOR AT GLASGOW UNIVERSITY WHO WAS PIVOTAL IN THE DISCOVERY WAS UNABLE TO CELEBRATE WITH COLLEAGUES BECAUSE HE'S NOW SUFFERING FROM DEMENTIA THE TURMOIL ON THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS IS THE BIG STORY FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES
TALKS ABOUT THE NEGATIVE BORROWING RATES IMPOSED BY THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK AND THE BANK OF JAPAN DESPERATE TO STIMULATE THEIR ECONOMIES STRIKING FEAR INTO INVESTORS THIS WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN SAYS THE F.T. OR SENSE THAT CENTRAL BANKS CAN NO LONGER BE RELIED ON AS THE ULTIMATE BACKSTOP OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAS TRIPPED THE MARKETS INTO SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH A LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER FROM MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY CONSERVATIVE COUNCILLORS WARNING HIM THAT HIPPY RISKS THAT HE RESTS THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THE PARTY IF HE IGNORES GRASSROOTS MEMBERS IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM COUNCILLORS ARGUE THERE MISTER CAMERON'S RENEGOTIATION WITH BRUSSELS HAS FAILED MEETING NONE OF THE PROMISES IN THE TORY MANIFESTO AND THE CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS THE ONLY HONEST AND RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO THE TELEGRAPH SAYS MY CAMERA
PROVOKED FURY AMONG ACTIVE LAST WEEK WHEN HE CALL ON TORY M.P.S TO IGNORE THEIR CONSTITUENCY ASSOCIATIONS OR MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS THE TIMES SAYS THE DUCHESS OF YORK HAS FORMALLY TURNED HER BACK ON BRITAIN BY APPLYING TO BECOME A RESIDENT OF SWITZERLAND WHICH WOULD GIVE A BIG TAX BENEFITS TO PAUSE THAT SHE NOW LIVES IN A THIRTEEN MILLION POUND CHALET BOUGHT BY HER FORMER HUSBAND PRINCE ANDREW IN THE SKI RESORT OF BUT THE TIMES THAT THE VIRTUOUS
DISAPPEARED FROM BRITAIN ALTOGETHER SHE STILL RENT A FLAT IN LONDON AND USES A ROOM AT THE DUKE'S HOME IN WINDSOR FOR FAMILY OCCASIONS THAT I'M SIXTY MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING IS THAT WORLD POWERS HAVE AGREED WHAT THEY'VE CALLED A NATIONWIDE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN SYRIA BUT IT WON'T COVER THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE CROUP AND RUSSIA WILL CONTINUE TO BOMB MILITANTS IT REGARDS AS TERRORISTS
FEELINGS AS THEY SAY RAN HIGH IN THE COMMONS YESTERDAY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THE TIME HAD COME FOR NEW CONTRACTS TO BE IMPOSED ON JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND AS SUSAN HUMOUR REPORTS FROM WESTMINSTER THE TONE OF THE HEALTH SECRETARY AT THE DESPATCH BOX COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE SOMBRE
LIKE A DOCTOR WAS BAD NEWS THE HEALTH SECRETARY FOR ENGLAND JEREMY HUNT SPELT OUT THAT THIS WAS THE END AND CALM BUT SORROWFUL TONES THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR SIR DAVID DOULTON HAD DONE ALL HE COULD TO SAVE THE TOPS BUT CARRYING ON WAS NO KINDNESS SO HE HAS ASKED ME TO ENTER THE UNCERTAINTY FOR THE SERVICE
BY PROCEEDING WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CONTRACT BUT HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES CONSIDERED BOTH SAFER FOR PATIENTS AND FAIR AND REASONABLE FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS
I HAVE THEREFORE TODAY DECIDED TO DO THAT WELL HAVE JEREMY HUNT'S BEDSIDE MANNER EREBUS ALL SAD ACCEPTANCE HIS LABOUR SHADOW HEIDI ALEXANDER'S SOUNDED MORE LIKE UPSET AND ANGRY RELATIVES
SECRETARY NOT TO SEE THAT IMPOSING A NEW CONTRACT WHICH DOESN'T ENJOY THE CONFIDENCE OF JUNIOR DOCTORS WILL DESTROY MORALE WHICH IS
COULD LEAD TO A PROTRACTED PERIOD OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION WHICH WILL BE DISTRESSING FOR EVERYONE
ONE WHO WORK SANE OR DEPENDS UPON THE N.H.S. BUT JEREMY HUNT WAS COMFORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT HISTORY WOULD PROVE THEM RIGHT WHEN WE HAVE A SEVEN DAY N.H.S. IN A FEW YEARS' TIME
PEOPLE SAY IT WAS OBVIOUS AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO THERE REMEMBER IT WASN'T EASY TO GET THERE AND THEY'LL ALSO REMEMBER SADLY THE BIG COOL SHE MADE TODAY WHICH WAS TO PUT SHORT TERM POLITICAL ADVANTAGE
LABOUR'S JACK DRUGGED ME BELIEVE JEREMY HUNT HIMSELF HAD MADE THE DISPUTE TOXIC DOES THE SECRETARY OF STATE NOT FEEL A SENSE OF SHAME
THAT HIS HANDLING OF THIS DISPUTE SHOULD HAVE SO POISONED RELATIONSHIPS WITH JUNIOR DOCTORS THE BACKBONE OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE NEW CONTRACT IS TO HELP IMPROVE PATIENT CARE AT WEEKENDS OR CONSERVATIVE JULIAN LEWIS HAS EXPERIENCED A WEEKEND TRIP TO HOSPITAL ALBEIT NOT RECENTLY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
I WAS KNOCKED OFF A MOTORCYCLE BY A CARELESS DRIVER ON A SUNDAY BECAUSE STAFF WE'RE NOT IN THE HOSPITAL THE WOUND COULD BE CLEANED UNTIL IT WAS X. RAYED BECAUSE WE COULDN'T BE CLEANED I GOT AN INFECTION CHANGE COME SLOWLY HE MUSED
WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON THIS EPISODE PEOPLE WILL BE VERY SURPRISED THAT TOOK MAYBE FORTY YEARS FROM THAT ACCIDENT OF MINE TO BRING ABOUT THIS LONG OVERDUE
NOW FUNDING FOR THE HEALTH SERVICE IS USUALLY PRETTY POPULAR FUNDING FOR POLITICS IS NOT GENERALLY QUITE SUCH A WINNER THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANNING A NINETEEN PERCENT CUT IN THE MONEY THAT GOES TO OPPOSITION PARTIES TO HELP THEM DO THEIR PARLIAMENTARY BUSINESS OF SCRUTINISING MINISTERS AND REPRESENTING THEIR CONSTITUENTS THE MINISTER JOHN PENROSE SAID POLITICIANS HAD TO TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS JUST AS PLAUTUS HAD
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE POLITICIAN SHOULD ARGUE THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN SOME WAY EXEMPT A SPECIAL CLASS AND NOT HAVE TO DO THEIR BIT
HE SAYS THE FUNDING HAS GONE UP BY FIFTY PERCENT IN RECENT TIMES FUNDING POLITICIANS MIGHT NOT BE POPULAR BUT A LIB DEM TOM BRAKE DIDN'T THINK THE ALTERNATIVE WAS TERRIBLY ATTRACTIVE CAN THE MINISTER GUARANTEE THAT THESE CUTS WILL NOT BE THE FINAL CHAPTER IN OUR TRANSITION FOR ME MULTI PARTY STATE TWEE ONE PARTY STATE ROBERT MUGABE WOULD BE
JOHN PENROSE SAID THE SHORT ANSWER WAS NO BUT LABOUR'S CAT SMITHS OR PATTERN SHE TOLD THE MINISTER THIS CUT CAME IN THE CONTEXT OF A TRADE UNION BILL WHICH TAKES FUNDS ON THE LABOUR PARTY AND STUFFING UP THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND CHANGING OF THE ELECTORAL REGISTER AND THE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL
WILL YOU NOW ADMIT THAT THE SO CALLED ONE NATION PARTY IS TRYING TO CREATE A ONE PARTY MOTION
BERNARD JENKIN THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE WAS NOT QUITE COMFORTABLE ABOUT THE MOVE EITHER IF THE POLICY IS AS REASONABLE AS HE INSISTS THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAVE HANDLED THIS MATTER IN A CLUMSY MANNER THAT THE OPPOSITION FEELS A CONSULT
OR IS IT THAT THERE IS AN AGENDA BEHIND THIS CHANGE WHICH HAS BUT THIS IS RATHER MORE POLITICAL IN IT SINCE
WELL UKIP'S DOUGLAS CARS WILL PREVIOUSLY TURNED DOWN THE MONEY TO THE ANNOYANCE OF HIS PARTY'S OFFICIALS WHO NEEDS BACKROOM STAFF YOU ARGUED WHEN YOU'VE GOT A SMART FILM
WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE GOOGLE IS AT OUR FINGERTIPS WE DON'T NEED AN ARMY OF RESEARCHERS WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF TWITTER AND BLOGS WE DO NOT NEED A WHOLE APARTMENT OR PRESS OFFICERS THE PUBLIC HE SAID WERE DEEPLY RESENT THEIR MONEY BEING SPENT ON POLITICIANS TO DO MORE POLITICS
THAT WAS SUSAN HUME REPORTING ON ME YESTERDAY IN WESTMINSTER MORE FROM HER EIGHT THIRTY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOR A LONG WAY OF TIME NOW TEN TO SEVEN CAN THE POPE RESCUE MEXICO FROM ITS DRUG FUELLED NIGHTMARE OF VIOLENCE AND CRIME IS GOING THERE FOR FIVE DAYS AND OF COURSE HE CAN'T HIMSELF CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE NATION BUT CAN HE PERSUADE MEXICANS THAT THEY HAVE IT WITHIN THEIR POWER TO MAKE THEIR COUNTRY BETTER CAN HE IN OTHER WORDS DO SOME GOOD FROM MEXICO KATIE WATSON
AS THE ORGAN GRINDER IN MEXICO CITY'S MAIN SQUARE PLAYS HIS FAMILIAR TUNES TO THE TOURISTS WORKERS ARE BUSY PREPARING FOR THE MASSES
FINISHING OFF THE STANDS AND RIGGING THE LIGHTING HEAD OF POPE FRANCIS VISIT
THIS WILL BE HIS FIRST TRIP TO MEXICO IT'S A LOT OF HOPE BEING PINNED ON THIS TRIP BY HIS FOLLOWERS THAT WHAT HE DOES WHAT HE SAYS COULD MAKE A REAL IMPACT ON THE DIRECTION OF THIS COUNTRY TO COME ON HE'S LATIN AMERICAN AND SO FOR ME COMING TO MEXICO MEETING US GOING FOR A VIRGIN IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT
THE IMPACT WILL BE HUGE IT'S GREAT FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE OF ALL THE VIOLENCE HERE WE ARE FAKE BUT THIS COULD CHANGE THINGS
IN SUNDAY SERMONS TALK OF PEACE NOT VIOLENT ECHOES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS NOT IMMUNE TO MEXICO'S PROBLEMS SINCE IN GREEK OPINION YET IT BECAME PRESIDENT FOUR YEARS AGO TWELVE PRIESTS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND TWO ARE MISSING
MEXICO IS NOW THOUGHT TO BE THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH
FATHER OF MUSCLE DELLA IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CATHOLIC MULTI MEDIA CENTRE IN A TOUGH EDIBLE BUT NOT PUT A LIST
A PRIEST BY ITS VERY NATURE IS A PREACHER WHO LEADS AND HELPS FORM OPINIONS AND HIS COMMUNITY'S BUT THIS HAS MADE THINGS DIFFICULT IT'S INCONVENIENCED ORGANISED CRIME THEY ARE TRYING TO PUT FEAR INTO PEOPLE TO CORRUPT ORGANISATIONS AND OBVIOUSLY KILLING PRIESTS IS DISRUPTING THE SOCIAL FABRIC IT'S OBVIOUS IT'S WORRYING AND THINGS AREN'T GETTING BETTER
THE SEASIDE RESORT OF ACAPULCO USED TO BE THE HOLIDAY DESTINATION OF HOLLYWOOD STARS NOW IT'S MORE FAMOUS FOR BEING ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT CITIES IN THE WORLD SO PRIESTS WHO STATED GET AERO WHERE ACAPULCO IS IS THE MOST
AND UP INTO THE HILLS OF ACAPULCO TO A NEIGHBOURHOOD CALLED LA LACQUER AS AN INCREDIBLE VIEW OF THE BAY AND THE
THIS IS ONE OF THE POOREST PARTS OF ACAPULCO OR HALF BUILT HOUSES
SEWAGE PROBLEMS LITTLE WINDING ROADS AN OLD ABANDONED CARS JUST LITTER THE ROADS HERE THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE MORE DANGERS PARTS OF THE CITY AND YOU CAN SEE POLICE AND ARMY PATROLLING THE STREETS
HE'S LOST MENDOZA HAS BEEN THE PRIEST IN THE LACQUER FOR TWENTY YEARS HE KNOWS WHO THE CRIMINALS ARE THEY WATCH HIM CONSTANTLY SO HE DOESN'T STEP OUT OF LINE
BUT THEN I MUST GIVE COPE WITHOUT A BUT THAT I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH COLBY MONTHS HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE SEE HERE IN THE COMMUNITY IF I SEEN SOMETHING THAT COULD PUT ME IN DANGER I WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE AND I DON'T WANT TO THINGS SAY SAY COULD DRIVE ME OUT O.K. ME I WANT TO BE HERE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE NEED ME
IT'S ALSO HIS HOPE FOR THE POPE'S VISIT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT BUT FOR THAT HE'LL NEED TO TOUCH ON SORE SUBJECTS CORRUPTION AND THE LINKS BETWEEN POLITICIANS AND CRIMINALS THAT SAYS HE'S YOURS IS WHERE THIS COUNTRY IS STUCK
PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE SENT YARD WHILE AGREES WE MEXICAN SO FED UP WITH CORRUPTION BY YOUR LIVES MEDIOCRITY WERE RULING ELITES THEREFORE WE ARE LOOKING FOR THEM
DAWSON THE CATHOLICS AND THE NON CATHOLICS THE BELIEVERS AND NON BELIEVERS AND TO BE SIT THERE WITH A PUB CAN BE AN INGREDIENT IN THE CREATION OF THIS HUGE DON'T DIGNIFY MEXICO THAT DOCTOR IN MEXICO
CLEANING UP THIS COUNTRY IS A BIG CHALLENGE AT TIMES IT'S HARD TO SEE A WAY FORWARD BUT NEXT WEEK AT LEAST THE EXPECTATIONS ARE HIGH
WATSON THAT WAS REPORTING FROM MEXICO ON THE POPE'S VISIT THE TIME SIX MINUTES TO SET HOW DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE TRAIN ROUTES IN ENGLAND AND WALES YOU'LL NEED DEEP POCKETS BUT HE'D BE DOING EVERYONE A FAVOUR THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE OF M.P.S IS WORRIED BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH COMPANIES HAVE BIDS SO THEY WON'T BE ENOUGH COMPETITION ON THAT MEANS WE COULD ALL END UP OUT OF POLISH EXCUSE ME OUT OF POCKET MAKE CHAIRS THAT COMMITTEE
SO ODD BUSINESS ISN'T IT WHY DO THEY WANT TO RUN THEM WELL ABSOLUTELY I MEAN AGAIN THE GOVERNMENT SET UP THIS POLICY WHICH IS PREDICATED ON HAVING COMPETITION TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT GOOD SERVICE AND IT'S COST AFFECTS THE WHOLE POND ABSOLUTELY BUT THAT WOULD BE THE LAST BID THAT'S COME OUT ONLY TO THE SOUTHWESTERN FRENCH AS ENERGY COMPANIES HAVE BID TO RUN THAT CONTRACT FROM JUNE NEXT YEAR IN THE CUT THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF SAYS IT HAS FEWER THAN THREE THEN THERE'S A REAL RISK TO THAT COMPETITIVE STRUCTURE WORKING SO BY THEIR OWN STANDARDS THEY'RE FAILING AT THE MOMENT
WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMEBODY WILL RUB THEM IN THE END WELL ABSOLUTELY WHAT'S HAPPENS AND THERE WAS A BIG PROPERTY A BIG PROBLEM BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THEY HAD TO RE COMPLETELY RECONFIGURE HAVING DONE THIS SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN THEY'VE MADE ELEVEN DIRECT TOWARDS THAT MEANS THERE HASN'T BEEN COMPETITION PARTLY COS THEY COULDN'T MANAGE ALL THOSE FRANCHISES ONCE SO THERE SORRY SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO RUN THEM THEY'RE JUST NOT PREPARED TO COMPETE THAT'S RIGHT EVELYN WORK AND ONE OF THE THINGS OF COURSE IS THE COST OF GOING THROUGH THAT FRANCHISE COISTY
SO THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT'S TRYING TO LOOK AT THAT BUT IT IS QUITE COSTLY AND WHAT'S ALSO APPARENT IS THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE EXISTING OWNER OF THE FRANCHISE WINS IT AGAIN SO IF YOU HAD OUTSIDE BIT OR YOU MIGHT LOOK AT IT TO I THINK DO I WANT TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT ENERGY AND COMPETITION AND ALSO WE HAD FROM THE COMPANIES THEY WANT THESE CAN'T CONTRACTS TO BE A BIT MORE FLEXIBLE SO THAT THEY CAN CHANGE THEM AS THEY GO TO GIVE MODERN AND UP TO DATE SERVICES TO PASSENGERS AND THEY FEEL QUITE INFLEXIBLE AND THERE'S OTHER COMPETITION AROUND THE WORLD THAT THEY CAN BID FOR A BULL WHY CAN'T THEY DO IT AND IF THEY WANTED YOU WANT STOP IT
I WANT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO A TUTU TO MAKE THEIR SERVICE BETTER THAN IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS LOOK AT THE HAS BEEN A REAL INFLEXIBILITY IN HOW THOSE FRANCHISES ALLOW FOR THOSE IMPROVEMENTS IN AN ONGOING WAY SO THAT YOU CAN'T IF YOU HAVE TO CHECK WANT TO CHANGE IT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE FRANCHISEE AND TO A DEGREE FOR THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY'VE SET IN A VERY
VERY RESTRICTIVE WAY THERE'S NOW SAYING THE GOVERNMENT BUT THEY'RE PUTTING PASSENGER EXPERIENCE AT THE HEART OF IT BUT WE WERE NOT CONVINCED THAT WHEN WHEN PASSENGERS WILL SEE THOSE BENEFITS IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU TRAVEL ON THE TRAIN APART FROM OVERCROWDING AND THINGS LIKE THAT THE SERVICES LIKE WIFE I COULD CLEAN STATIONS IT'S SERVICES ON BOARD THOSE ARE NOT REALLY AT THE HEART OF THE FRANCHISE BEDS AT THE MOMENT IT'S VERY TECHNICAL POLICY
VERY COMPLEX GOOD SORT OF WHITEHALL POLICY STUFF BUT IN TERMS OF THE MANAGEMENT AND DELIVERY OF IT IT'S NOT GOING AS WELL AS IT SHOULD SO FAIRLY QUICKLY THEN IF YOU WOULD ARE WE GOING TO SEE SERVICES DIDGERI GET EVEN WORSE OVER THE NEXT ONE BECAUSE CERTAINLY A RISK OF THAT IF THIS LATEST FRANCHISE A BIT HE'S ONLY GOT TWO COULDN'T BIDDERS HERE THAT IT WAS A WORRY WHEN WE HAD A HEARING IT'S PROVING TO BE RIGHT SO LESS THAN MORE PEOPLE ENTER THE MARKET UNDER THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT'S CURRENT MODEL THERE IS A RISK TO THAT PRICES GOING UP
THAT IT IS BUT THAT'S THAT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY REGULATED IT BIDDICK IT CERTAINLY IT'S MORE ABOUT THE PASSENGER EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT REALLY GOOD COMPETITION AND THE TAXPAYER COST IT'S NOT GOOD COMPETITION YOU'LL BE EXPENSIVE FOR THE TAXPAYER AND THERE WILL BE A REAL RISK THAT THOSE PASSENGER SERVICES THAT WE WANTS IMPROVED WHEN HAPPENED MEG HILLIER THANKS A LOT
SEVEN TIME FOR THE WEATHER BEN WHICH IS IN ABOUT HI JUSTIN THANK YOU WELL THERE'S CERTAINLY A CHILL IN THE AIR AGAIN TODAY THAT IS A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME IT'S GOING TO STAY COLD THROUGH THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT WHEREAS YESTERDAY MANY OF US HAD PLENTY OF WINTER SUNSHINE TODAY WILL BE GENERALLY A CLOUDY AFFAIR I'LL BEGIN WITH THE FORECAST ACROSS SOUTH WEST ENGLAND HERE ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY DAY SOME OUTBREAKS OF RAIN PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO THE SOUTH COAST THIS MORNING BUT EVEN AS THE MAIN RAIN AREA CLEARS AWAY BY THIS AFTERNOON STILL LOTS OF CLOUD SOME SHOWERY RAIN AT TIMES

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING AN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED TO IMPLEMENT A NATIONWIDE TRUCE IN SYRIA WITHIN A WEEK BUT THE RUSSIANS WILL NOT STOP BOMBING TERRORIST GROUPS THE LEADERS OF TEN N.H.S. TRUSTS IN ENGLAND HAVE INSISTED THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR DECISION TO IMPOSE NEW CONTRACTS ON JUNIOR DOCTORS AND LARGER FIRMS THAT FAILED TO ADDRESS THE GENDER PAY GAP COULD BE NAMED IN A LEAGUE TABLE TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS CHRIS
AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED THAT INTERNATIONAL TALKS FOR WHAT'S BEEN CALLED A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN SYRIA WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK LEADING TO A LONG TERM COMPREHENSIVE CEASEFIRE THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE BY THE AMERICAN SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY AT A NEWS CONFERENCE IN THE GERMAN CITY OF MUNICH LATE LAST NIGHT ALONGSIDE HIS RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS ARE GAY LAVROV THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT COVER U.N. DESIGNATED TERRORISTS GROUPS SUCH AS ISLAMIC STATE AND THE NOSE FOR A FRONT
MY KERRY ALSO ANNOUNCED MEASURES TO EASE THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE REAL TEST WILL BE WHETHER ALL SIDES HONOURED THEIR COMMITMENTS ARE CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT REPORTS FROM MUNICH
AFTER HOURS OF DIFFICULT TALKS CAME NEWS OF A BREAKTHROUGH ON TWO KEY ISSUES ORCHESTRA START IMMEDIATELY YOUNG DELIVERING BADLY NEEDED AID TO BESIEGE VARIOUS ACROSS THAT MEANS PROVIDING FOOD AND MEDICINE TO MORE THAN HALF A MILLION SYRIANS MANY LIVING IN DESPERATE CONDITIONS AND OVER THE NEXT WEEK MY DALLA TEAS FOR A TRUCE OR TO BE PUT IN PLACE BUT THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE RUSSIA'S BOMBING OF ALEPPO AND WHAT IT CALLS TERRORIST TARGETS WHICH THE CRITICS SAY
HE'S ON THE STRENGTHENING SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES THEIR SCEPTICISM HERE BUT A TRUCE AND AN END TO THE SIEGES CAN BE ACHIEVED EVEN SERGEI LAVROV AND JOHN KERRY ADMITTED THIS WAS FOR NOW JUST PROGRESS ON PAPER
THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL PROVE WHETHER IT IS ANY MORE THAN WORDS
SOME LEADING N.H.S. CHIEF EXECUTIVES HAVE DISTANCED THEMSELVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT ON JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND THEY SAY THEIR PAY OFFER IS FAIR BUT INSISTS THEY DIDN'T SUPPORT THE CONTRACTS INTRODUCTION WITHOUT THE AGREEMENT OF STAFF SOME OF THE N.H.S. BOSSES HAVE FACED CRITICISM FROM DOCTORS FOR APPARENTLY SUPPORTING THE HEALTH SECRETARIES MOVE HERE'S A HEALTH EDITOR HUGH PYM
THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT A NEW CONTRACT WOULD BE IMPOSED ON ENGLAND'S JUNIOR DOCTORS AFTER TALKS WITH THE B.M.A. STALLED HE SAID HE WAS TAKING THE ADVICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S MAIN NEGOTIATOR SIR DAVID DALTON IN A LETTER TO MY HUNT SIR DAVID SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO WHATEVER IT DEEMS NECESSARY TO END UNCERTAINTY AND ENSURE A NEW CONTRACT WAS IN PLACE HE SAID THIS POSITION HAD THE BACKING OF TWENTY N.H.S. CHIEF EXECUTIVES BUT WHEN CONTACTED BY HEALTH SERVICE JOURNAL
TEN SAID THEY DID NOT SUPPORT THE IMPOSITION OF THE CONTRACT WHAT EVEN SUGGESTED HE'D SUPPORTED A DIFFERENT LETTER TO THE ONE PUBLISHED SO DAVID DALTON LATER TOLD HEALTH SERVICE JOURNAL BUT THE STATEMENT THE SIGNATORIES AGREED TO WAS CONFIRMING THE FINAL POSITION WAS FAIR AND REASONABLE AND NOT SIGNIFYING SUPPORT FOR IMPOSITION OF THE CONTRACT
THE ENGINE MAKE A ROLLS ROYCE HAS JUST ANNOUNCED A FULL IN PRE TAX PROFITS FROM ONE POINT SIX BILLION TO ONE POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS THE COMPANY IS HALVING ITS DIVIDEND THE FIRST CUT IN MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS BUT IT HASN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT FURTHER JOB CUTS BEYOND THE THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED REDUNDANCIES ANNOUNCED PREVIOUSLY
LARGE COMPANIES THAT FAILED TO DEAL WITH THE GENDER PAY GAP COULD BE NAMED AND GOVERNMENT LEAGUE TABLES AND THE NEW REGULATIONS FIRMS WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY STAFF WILL HAVE TO REVEAL ON THEIR WEBSITES TO PAY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEIR MALE AND FEMALE EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE SAME SALARY BAND LATEST FIGURES SUGGEST WOMEN IN THE U.K. STILL EARN ON AVERAGE TWENTY PERCENT LESS THAN MEN IN SIMILAR ROLES IN EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN IS CONFIDENT THE RULES WILL ENCOURAGE FAIRER PAY DISTRIBUTION
COMPANIES WILL HOPEFULLY WE EXPECT THEM FROM THE RESPONSE WE'VE HAD TO THINK A LOT HARDER ABOUT WHERE WOMEN ARE IN THEIR WORKFORCE AND HOW THEY'RE DISTRIBUTED WHAT WAY OF BEING PAID BUT I THINK ALL ALSO DRIVE APPLICATIONS TO WORK IN CERTAIN ORGANISATIONS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOMEN WILL LOOK AND SEE WHAT HIS AGENDA PICK UP HIS ORGANISATION IS SOMETHING I WANT TO JOIN
BUT SALLY BREAD FROM THE TRADES UNION CONGRESS BELIEVES THE MEASURES DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT REASONS WHY GENDER PAY GAPS ARISE IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND FOR SOME EMPLOYERS JUST PUBLISHING AGENDA PAY GAP FIGURE WHICH IS
MAYBE VERY LOW MAY ACTUALLY BE QUITE MISLEADING ABOUT HOW WOMEN IN THAT WORKPLACE
POLICE HAVE ARRESTED THE PARTNER OF THE FORMER EASTENDERS ACTRESS CYAN BLAKE ON SUSPICION OF MURDERING HER AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARTHUR SIMPSON KENT WAS DETAINED AT HEATHROW AIRPORT THIS MORNING AFTER FLYING BACK FROM GHANA THE BODIES OF MIZ BLAKE AND HER SONS WERE FOUND IN THE GARDEN OF THEIR HOME IN SOUTH EAST LONDON IN DECEMBER
A GROUP OF M.P.S AS WARNED THAT THE TAXPAYER MIGHT NOT BE GETTING VALUE FOR MONEY FROM RAIL FRANCHISES BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INTEREST FROM PRIVATE FIRMS THE COMMONS PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS THAT NOT ENOUGH COMPANIES ARE BIDDING TO RUN TRAIN ROUTES IN ENGLAND AND WALES AS A TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT RICHARD WESCOTT EXPLAINS
EVERY FEW YEARS THE GOVERNMENT ASKS PRIVATE COMPANIES TO BID TO RUN TRAINS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES MINISTERS SAY IT'S ALWAYS BEST IF AT LEAST THREE FIRMS COMPETE FOR EACH RAIL FRANCHISE BUT THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS THERE ARE SIGNS THAT INTEREST IS DWINDLING AMONGST COMPANIES WILLING TO MAKE AN OFFER RECENTLY IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT JUST TWO COMPANIES WILL FIGHT IT OUT TO RUN THE SOUTH WESTERN FRANCHISE

THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT SEEMS THERE HAS BEEN A BREAKTHROUGH OF SWORD TO EMPHASISE OF SORTS IN THE TALKS THAT ARE TRYING TO END THE FIGHTING IN SYRIA THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF SEVENTEEN COUNTRIES HAVE AGREED TO BRING ABOUT WHAT THEY CALL A NATIONWIDE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IS SET A TARGET OF A WEEK THAT IS NOT OF COURSE THE SAME AS SAYING THAT THE PARTY'S ON THE GROUND HAVE AGREED TO STOP FIGHTING I'M JOINED BY GUARDI SERI WHO IS AN EXPERT IN THESE MATTERS
CHATHAM HOUSE EXPERT THAT IS I SAY OF SWORDS A BREAKTHROUGH OF SORTS WHAT MATTERS
IT SEEMS IS THAT RUSSIA AND AMERICA ARE BOTH WERE PARTY TO THIS THAT IS DEFINITELY VERY VERY IMPORTANT INTO WHAT WE REALISE AFTER THE FAILURE OF THE GENEVA PROCESS EARLIER THIS MONTH IS THAT THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A CIVIL WAR GOING ON IN SYRIA THERE HAS BEEN WIDE MISTRUST BETWEEN THEM THE GROUPS THE INTERNATIONAL
COUNTRIES THERE ARE BACKING DIFFERENT GROUPS INSIDE SYRIA AND I THINK THE WAR ON TERRORISM THAT EVERY INTERNATIONAL POWER IS CLAIMING TO BE WAGING IN SYRIA HAS SORT OF CLASHED OVER WHO WAS A TERRORIST WHO IS NOT AND THEREFORE A LETTER OR DISTRUST THAT LED TO THE FAILURE OF THE GENEVA PROCESS WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A BIZARRE SORT OF AGREEMENT IN NOT IN A SENSE BECAUSE IT IS ALLOWING RUSH SHOULD CONTINUE ATTACKING
TERRORISTS AS IT WERE BUT THE VERY FAT THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SEAS PHONE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY BOMBING TARGETS IN SYRIA'S RATHER WEIRD ISN'T IT WELL THAT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO TRACKS TO THE SYRIAN WARD THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A CIVIL WAR TODAY THIS IS A REGIONAL COMPONENT WHAT WE SAW ABOUT A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN A RUSSIAN JET WAS DONE BY AT MY TURKISH DEFENCES A NATO COUNTRY IS REMINISCENT OF THE COLD WAR IT IS A VERY RISKY BUSINESS FOR THE REGION AND THEREFORE
IT IS NORMAL THAT WE HAVE THIS TWO PARA POLICIES THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS WILL BE WHAT ARE THE GROUPS THAT RUSSIA WILL BE LOOKING AT AS TERRORIST HAVING STAYED PRESUMABLY PRESUMABLY BUT MOST ROUND OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH ARE ALSO FIGHTING PRISON
AND IF RUSSIA SORT OF TARGETS THEM HEAVILY THEY MIGHT ALSO AS TAKING A SIDE WITH PRESENT I SAID RATHER THAN TRYING TO BRING PEACE TO THE COUNTRY ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACT IS THAT IT SEEMS THAT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS NOW ACCEPTED TACITLY AT LEAST THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT IS GOING TO PACK IT ALL IN AND LEAVE AND GO AND LIVE IN A NICE NEUTRAL COUNTRY AND
PEACE RAIN THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN WE CAN'T FORGET THAT THE UNITED STATES IS PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN STABILISING IRAQ IN SYRIA AND UNDERMINING THE EFFORTS OF THE ISLAMIC SID OF EYES AS OR IN SPREADING ITS INFLUENCE AND THEREFORE THEY'RE MEAN POLICY WILL FOCUS ON THAT AND THE SEARING COTTAGE IT IS THEN A PART OF THAT WHY THEIR POLICY OF COUNTERING TERRORISM WHICH IS MORE OF THE NATIONAL INTEREST FOR UNITED STATES THEN JUST SOLVING THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA
DO YOU SEE THIS AS A REAL BREAKTHROUGH THEN I THINK IT'S A REAL IT'S A POSITIVE OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK AFTER THE G.EIGHT IN GENEVA PROCESS FAIL IT WILL BE GOOD CHANCE TO BUILD TRUST THE SYRIAN REGIME IF IF THEY FOLLOW WITH A CEASEFIRE THAT WAS SURE THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE THAT
THEY ARE WILLING TO ALLOW HUMANITARIAN AID INTO THE GETTING AND THE OPPOSITION WELL THEN EARNED THEIR LEGITIMACY IT NEEDS BY REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE OF THAT SUPPORTED THE OPPOSITION INSECTS ARE PROTECTING THEM AND THEREFORE ERASED THE PROCESS IN GENEVA TO A LEVEL WE CAN REALLY HAVE A PROPER CEASEFIRE IN AND TO HOSTILITIES COMPLETELY IN SYRIA TERRY SORRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN PROFITS DOWN AT ONE OF BRITAIN'S LARGEST ENGINEERS A ROLLS ROYCE IT IS OF COURSE BIG NEWS NOT JUST IN THE WORLD
BUSINESS BUT BIG NEWS FOR ALL OF US BECAUSE OF ITS PLACE IN THE NATION AND JOE'S HERE YEAH THAT'S TRUE JUST ME A ROLLS ROYCE OF REPORTED ANNUAL PROFITS BEFORE TAX AND MOVEMENTS IN THE VALUE OF THE POUND AT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS FROM LAST YEAR'S ONE POINT SIX BILLION SALES WERE ROUGHLY THE SAME AS LAST YEAR
BUT ITS DIFFIDENT HAS BEEN HAVE LET'S TALK TO SANJAY JAM FROM PAM YOU'RE GORDON GOOD MORNING SANJAY GOOD MORNING THE DECLINE CONTINUES BUT IT'S NOT QUITE AS BAD AS SOME ANALYST HAD HOPED OR EXPECTED
YES I THINK WE WE WERE HOPING THAT THEY WOULD SUSPEND HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY THAT WAS BASICALLY CASE
THE ACTUAL AT THE AT THE PROFITS BEING ONE POINT FOUR BILLION PEOPLE HAD EXCITED ONE POINT THREE THE REVENUES AND SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST STABLE NO I THINK I THINK THE ISSUE BOTHER DO MORE ABOUT THE CASH CONSTRAINTS AND GOING FOR THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS AS THE RAMP UP PRODUCTION
SO IT'S BASICALLY THE THESE SHE WON'T GIVE IN AND WAS MORE ABOUT AND DO CASH FLOW THAT'S SUPPOSED TO THE PIANO LAMBETH AND IN TERMS OF THE THE THE RESTRUCTURING THAT WARREN EAST THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ROLLS ROYCE'S INTRODUCING IS ON TRACK
I DON'T I MEAN I THINK THAT WE DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL BE A FEW YEARS BEFORE WE FIND OUT TO WHAT EXTENT THE RESTRICTION WILL WORK I THINK AT THE MOMENT AT THE PART OF THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE SALES FALLING IT'S HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY
HOW MUCH ARE THE RESTRUCTURING IS ACTUALLY HELPING THE BOTTOM LINE HOW MUCH IT IS LITERALLY TRYING TO SORT OF STOP THE BOTTOM LINE FOLLOWING FURTHER
SO THEY USUALLY SEVERAL YEARS THIS WILL BE NO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE RESTRUCTURING WILL WILL
I THINK AT THE MOMENT THE PRIMARY I THINK THE BIG CHALLENGE FOR THEM IS TO DEAL WITH
BASICALLY AROUND ENOUGH FOR THE PRODUCTS BUT THE SAME TIME NOT ON SEVENTEEN ACTUALLY CUSTOMERS TAKING DELIVERIES SO I THINK THAT
IT'S DAD TO TELL IN THAT THEY HAVE TO DO IT AND THAT'S WHY WE FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SUSPENDED HIM
IF ANYTHING THE S.T. SO THEY SHOULD RAISE SOME CASH JUST IN CASE THINGS GET REALLY TOUGH OH KAY AND THERE WAS NO PROFITS WARNING THIS TIME I PRESUME YOU'RE RELIEVED AT THAT
NO THERE'S NO CHANGE IN HER TURNING UP BUSINESS STICKING TO BOARD THE SAID IN NOVEMBER EXPECT ABOUT SIX ON IN FIFTY MINUTES OF HEADWINDS BASICALLY SAYING THAT'S THE CURRENT POSITION
WE FEEL THAT THERE'S PROBABLY MORE PRESSURE COMING IN SO I WON'T BE SURPRISED IF IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS
WE HAVE ANOTHER WARNING OH KAY SANJAY FROM A PEN YOU'RE GORDON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US JUST SOMETHING THAT HIT NOW THE COMPETITION MARKETS AUTHORITY AS HE'S GOING TO FIND A NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR ANTI COMPETITIVE CONDUCT AND AGREEMENTS IN RELATION TO THE SUPPLY OF
PARROT PAROXETINE AND IT INCLUDES GLAXOSMITHKLINE ONE OF THE LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL GIANTS IN THE U.K. SO WE GET A LOT MORE THAT I SUSPECT IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY THAT HAVE THAT FIND A NUMBER A PHARMACEUTICAL GIANTS FROM THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY JOE THANKS QUARTER PAST SEVEN IN THE GREAT STOCK MARKET FALLS OF RECENT DAYS THE BANKS HAVE TAKEN A PARTICULARLY HUGE HIT IS THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE GENUINELY VULNERABLE THAT OF COURSE WOULD BE A WORRY WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY FAIL
BUT SURELY THEY'RE STRONGER THAN THEY WERE LAST TIME ROUND THE LESS CORRUPT BETTER CAPITALISED WITH BUSINESS MODEL THAT CAN WITHSTAND CRISES WELL NOT ACCORDING TO PHIL ANJA LADIES WHO CHAIRED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FINANCIAL CRISIS ENQUIRY COMMISSION AS THE BODY THAT LOOKED INTO THE TWO THOUSAND MAKE DISASTER ON THE LINE FROM CALIFORNIA HE'S BEEN GIVING ME HIS TAKE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
I THINK YOU HAVE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN KNOCK SHORT TERM DE DE DE TURBULENCE
UNDERLINED FRAGILITY OF THE ECONOMY IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN THAT REGARD HERE WE ARE SOME NINE YEARS AFTER THE ONSET OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND IN MANY RESPECTS MANY REGIONS OF OUR COUNTRY ARE JUST BEGINNING TO GET ON THERE SEAT AND THERE IS THIS ENORMOUS OVERHANG IS BUT IN EUROPE FROM FINANCIAL MELTDOWN SO THAT THAT FINANCIAL SHARK OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WAS NOT SOME SMALL BUMP IN THE ROAD
IT WAS A FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH AT THE ECONOMY AND WE ARE STILL JUST CLIMBING OUT IN THAT REGARD VERY LITTLE HAS CHANGED OR NOT ENOUGH HAS CHANGED IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM FROM THE RUN UP TO THE CRISIS
GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE CHANGED AND HASN'T WE'LL LEARN AS HUMAN BEINGS AS BUSINESS PEOPLE FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR MISTAKES
BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WALL STREET WHICH WAS THE BENEFICIARY OF TWENTY FOUR SEPARATE PROGRAMMES OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WE'RE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MONEY POURED INTO THOSE INSTITUTIONS TO BAIL THEM OUT
REALLY NEVER LEARNED THE LESSONS OF THE CRISIS BECAUSE THEY WERE SPARED THE CONSEQUENCES THAT CRISIS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WALL STREET PAID NO LEGAL POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC PRICE FOR THEIR FINANCIAL DISASTER I THINK I THINK WE'VE BEEN TOLD IN CERTAIN IN EUROPE AND IN BRITAIN IN THE LAST PROBABLY MAYBE MORE THAN THAT IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO STOP BASHING THE BANKS THAT ACTUALLY THE BANKS HAVE THEY ARE GOOD
DECENT JOB WE'VE GOT TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT JOB THEY DO AN IMPORTANT JOB NICK IN THE WORLDWIDE ECONOMY AND JUST CONSTANTLY HAMMERING THEM ISN'T GOING TO GET US ANY WAY IT FEELS TO ME AS IF YOU THINK A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL THAT'S THAT'S BEEN THE WRONG MESSAGE
OBVIOUSLY THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS VITAL TO OUR KIND OF INTENSE AS THE HEART OF A KIND OF YOU BUT WHAT YOU WHAT IS YOUR HEART SHOULD BE AS THE STABLE OR HAD HIM YOU WANT TO FIND
TO BE THE SERVANT NOT THE MASTER OF THE ECONOMY AND WHAT WE SEE IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR IS WE SEE NOT JUST YOUR TRADITIONAL BORING BANK YOU WHICH IS REALLY THAT UNDERPINNING OF A STRONG ECONOMY BUT WE SEE ENORMOUS SPECULATIVE ACTIVITY AND ALSO SADLY WE'VE SEEN A CULTURE OF CORRUPTION
WE'VE SEEN INTEREST RATE MANIPULATION WE'VE SEEN MONEY OH ANDRE MIGHT MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SO THERE IS THIS TROUBLING CULTURE OF CORRUPTION HOW BIGGER TROUBLE ARE WE IN NOW AS A WORLD ECONOMY WE ARE STILL VERY FRAGILE SO YOU HAVE IN A SENSE
HER RECOVERY BUT IT'S NOT FULL THROWED IT IT'S NOT RIGHT WE BASED AND YOU ALSO HAVE THIS THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE'S AN ENORMOUS DEBT OVER WHETHER IT'S IN EUROPE WHERE THERE IS AMONG HOMEOWNERS STATES OR WHETHER IT'S IN CHINA
IF YOU MARRY THAT TO THE SITUATION THAT THE BANKS ARE IN AS YOU DESCRIBED NOT SUFFICIENTLY REFORMED
AND WE ARE TO HAVE ANOTHER REAL FINANCIAL SHOCK ACROSS THE WORLD HOW MUCH TROUBLE COULD WE BE
WE COULD BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE AND I'M NOT I DON'T WANT TO BE CHECKED AND WELL BUT THE VERY NATURE OF THE SYSTEM IS ABSENT REAL ATTENTION TO STABILITY IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IT IS PRONE
TWO EXPLOSIONS AND MELTDOWN FINANCIAL LADIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US IT WAS FINANCIAL LEADERS AND WE'LL BE TALKING BUT WE'LL CONCENTRATE ON TO TWO DIFFERENT AREAS ON CHINA AND ALSO IN THE ROLE OF CENTRAL BANKS IN ALL OF THIS AT EIGHT THIRTY

OR STARTED ASSESSING HOW TO DELIVER THIS FOOD OR MEDICINE
TEN THE N.H.S. BOSSES HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT THEY DID NOT BACK A NEW CONTRACT BEING FORCED ON JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND EVEN THOUGH THEIR NAMES APPEAR THERE A LETTER USED BY THE HEALTH SECRETARY TO JUSTIFY THE MOVE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAID THEY SUPPORTED THE CONTRACT ITSELF BUT NOT ITS IMPOSITION ON DOCTORS
THE ENGINE MAKE A ROLLS ROYCE HAS REPORTED THAT ITS PROFITS HAVE FALLEN BY TWELVE PERCENT OF THE COMPANY HAS HALVED ITS DIVIDEND IT SUFFERED A FALL IN DEMAND AS AIRLINES HAVE OPTED FOR COST EFFICIENT ENGINES WHILE OIL PRICES HAVE SLUMPED

THE TIME IS HALF PAST SEVEN ROLLS ROYCE ONCE THE GREAT SYMBOL OF BRITISH ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH TORRID TIMES FIVE PROFIT WARNINGS OF THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND THERE'S ANOTHER PRETTY GLOOMY SET OF RESULTS OUT THIS MORNING HERE'S ROLLS ROYCE AT ITS BEST IN ITS PRIME IN A PARFAIT REPORT FROM NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT A COMET AIRCRAFT POWERED BY A ROLLS ROYCE ENGINE
THE AMERICAN BUYING WOULD BE THE PERFECT IN A CLUB WELL INDEED GEORGE OSBORNE FIVE YEARS AGO AND HIS BUDGET PROMISED A RESURGENCE OF MANUFACTURING WHAT HE CALLED THE MARCH OF THE MAKERS SO THIS IS A PLAN FOR GROWTH WE WANT THE WORDS MADE IN BRITAIN CREATED HIM
DESIGNED IN BRITAIN INVENTED IN BRITAIN TO DRIVE OUR NATION FORWARD
IF BRITAIN CARRIED ALOFT BY THE MINDS OF THE MAKER
WELL IT HASN'T HAPPENED QUITE LIKE THAT IS HE MIGHT BE HIMSELF THE FIRST TO ADMIT LET'S ASK WHY I'M JOINED BY TWO PEOPLE
BOTH SIDES OF THE DIVIDE AS IT WERE THIS PHILIPPA WHOLE OLDHAM WHO IS THE HEAD OF TRANSPORT A MANUFACTURING FOR THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS AND HERE IN THE STUDIO SARAH WOOD WHO'S A CHIEF EXEC AND CO FOUNDER OF UNRULY THAT'S AN ADVERTISING TECH COMPANY SO WE'VE GOT TICK AND MANUFACTURING AS IT WERE SORT OF OLDHAM WHAT'S GONE WRONG
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING'S REALLY GONE WRONG IF YOU ACTUALLY TAKE THE MARCH OF THE MAKERS WE'VE SINNED U.K. CAR MANUFACTURING AT A TEN YEAR HIGH GRACE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND WE HAVE THE CATS POLE INNOVATION CENTRES FOR THE HIGH VALUE MANUFACTURING CATAPULT CENTRES AND FOR EVERY POUND OF GOVERNMENT INVESTED MONEY IN THAT IT RETURNS FIFTEEN POUNDS OF NAT
BENEFITS TO THE ECONOMY AND WE DO STILL HAVE THE SECOND LARGEST AEROSPACE SECTOR IN THE WORLD SO REALLY I THINK THAT WE WE IT ISN'T IT'S GLOOM IS DREAM IS EVERYBODY THINKS WELL EXCEPT THAT IF YOU COMPARE THE FIGURES NOW WITH THE START OF THE RECESSION THE PICTURE'S A BIT UNKIND MANUFACTURING OUTPUT BELOW THE LEVEL IT WAS WHEN GEORGE OSBORNE SAID HE WANTED TO BE CARRIED ALOFT ET-CETERA ET-CETERA SO THE START EXACTLY RIGHT DOES IT
IT DEPENDS HOW YOU LOOK AT MANUFACTURING IS A LONG TERM BUSINESS IF YOU TAKE THAT WE HAD A VERY LONG TIME IF I DID NEED STABILITY I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT ROLLS ROYCE THEY'D INVESTED ONE PUT ONE BILLION INTO THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS IS THEY'VE UPGRADED THEIR PRODUCTION LINES TO INCREASE THE AUTOMATION IN WHICH MEANS INSTEAD OF SAY TAKING AN HOUR AN HOUR AND A HALF TO PRODUCE A PROCESS
THEY CAN NOW RUN THEIR FACTORIES FOR BETWEEN TWELVE AND FORTY FIVE HOURS UNMANNED SO WITHOUT ANY HUMAN INTERVENTION WHICH MEANS THAT IT DRIVES COSTS DOWN AND IMPROVED PRODUCT SO I'M OUT THERE MAKING MONEY WELL IT BEGAN ITS LONG TERM YOU KNOW THEY THEY PROBABLY WON'T BEAT THE BENEFITS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY BUT I THINK THE FACT IS THEY ARE STILL MAKING MONEY EVEN THOUGH PROFITS ARE DOWN TODAY THEY ARE STILL PROFIT
SO AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED IN SOME OF THE TECH SIDE OF THINGS YOU'VE ONLY GOT THEM OPEN A COMPANY YOU'RE A BILLIONAIRE OVER THERE I DON'T KNOW I'M EXAM ALTHOUGH YOU'VE MADE AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY FOR SELLING OUT YOUR COMPANY SELLING OUT SELLING YOUR COMPANY SCALING SCALING THE COMPANY THAT'S IT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AT THE DIGITAL SECTOR IS BOOMING IT'S A HUGE GROWTH AREA BECAUSE THE WORLD IS GOING DIGITAL WE'RE ALL SPENDING MORE TIME ON OR SMARTPHONES ORDERING TAKEAWAYS BUYING CLOTHES FROM DIGITAL DEVICES
SO THAT IS FUELLING THE GROWTH YOU STILL NEED EFFICIENCY STILL NEED SCALE YOU STILL NEED EFFECTIVE ENTREPRENEURS WHO ALL COME TOGETHER AND BE PART OF AN ECOSYSTEM TO TRY FRAUD INNOVATION BUT IT IS IS IT EASIER TO MAKE MONEY IN THE TACKLE OF THE DIGITAL WORLD AS YOU DESCRIBED IT THAN IT IS IN THE COLD HARD WORD ABOUT WORLD OF ENGINEERING IT CERTAINLY IS IT IS START A COMPANY
AND TO GET OUT YOUR M.V.P. VIABLE PRODUCT WHAT M. P. P. MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT IN WHAT'S IT MINIMAL VIABLE PERSON IT'S AN EARLY STAGE OF A PRODUCT SO ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF WORKING IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IS YOU DON'T HAVE LONG PRODUCTION LEAD TIMES YOU CAN CREATE SOMETHING QUITE SIMPLE GET IT OUT THEIR TEST IT WITH SOME CUSTOMERS SEE WHAT THEY THINK AND THEN DECIDE WHERE TO MOVE NEXT AND INNOVATE FROM THAT YES YOU CAN GET OUT AN IDEA CAN'T YOU THAT'S THE THING ABSOLUTELY AN IDEA MAYBE IT WAS HIDING
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENT IN THE TECH INDUSTRY FROM THE SEAS FROM ENTREPRENEURS THEMSELVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S REALLY HELPED O'GRADY TO GROW THAT DIGITAL ECONOMY BUT ULTIMATELY SOMEBODY'S GOTTA MAKE WHAT YOU PRODUCE IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA FOR A FANCY PHONE SOMEBODY'S GOTTA MAKE THAT FILM ABSOLUTELY AND THERE'S A HUGE MAKE A REVOLUTION HAPPENING HERE IN THE U.K. RIGHT THIS IS THINK ABOUT THREE.D. PRINTERS THINK ABOUT THE INTERNET OF THINGS THERE ARE HUGE CHANGES SWEEPING ACROSS MANUFACTURING SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT MANUFACTURING I DON'T JUST THINK ABOUT CARS
I THINK ABOUT SMART LIGHT BULBS I THINK ABOUT'S NOT DOORBELL SMART CLOTHES SMART BANDAGES OVER THE COMING TOGETHER OF THE INTERNET OF CONNECTED DEVICES AND MANUFACTURING IS REALLY EXCITING AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE AT THE VANGUARD OF THAT MOVEMENT AND THAT'S WHERE EDUCATION IS SO IMPORTANT SO IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE BUILD ON THAT
THAT WORK IS SORT OF BYPASSING BRITISH ENGINEERING COMPANIES IN SOME PECULIAR WAY NO NOT AT ALL THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THE INVESTMENT MONEY'S GOING BY THE RISE IN AUTOMATION IS ENABLING THESE MANUFACTURERS TO BECOME MORE DIGITISED AND MORE CONNECTED WITH THE PACE OF CHANGE WE EXPECT IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS IS IT FOR THIS MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE DIGITISATION THE CREATION OF THESE NEW MATERIALS A LOT SARAH'S TALKING THIS INTERNET OF THINGS BIG DATA EIGHT ARE GOING TO BE DRAMATIC WITHIN MANUFACTURING
THAT ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IT'S DOWN TO THE DATA AND HOW ACCURATE AND RELIABLE THAT DATA IS TO MAKE SURE WE BEAT THE BENEFIT OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THESE TWO THINGS GO IN TANDEM BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST OVER THE PAST MANY MANY IS THAT WHEN THAT PHONE IS INVENTED IT GETS MADE IN CHINA OR SOMEWHERE LIKE CHINA
IT IN SOME PARTS IT DOES BUT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS AGAIN WHILE WE'RE SING THIS RISE IN AUTOMATION AND AND I'M TALKING ABOUT INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION SO THESE ARE ROBOTS POTENTIALLY THAT I CAN PUT A MULTI SKILLED SO THEY DON'T JUST PICK AND PLACE BUT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITY WHICH MEANS THAT ACTUALLY IT DECREASES THE COST SO IT MEANS THAT WE CAN PRODUCE THINGS CHEAPLY HAIR EXCEPT THERE FROM WHAT YOU WERE SAYING
THEY WILL BE MADE IN SUCH DIFFERENT WAYS WE WON'T HAVE THE FACTORIES WITH THE SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE CHIMNEYS IN THE SAME WAY WELL HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE THE SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE CHIMNEYS BUT LOTS THE INITIATIVES THAT FOR THE PRESS TALKING ABOUT AS HE'S GOING TO HELP US MAKE SURE THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE BEING MANUFACTURED HERE AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE IN THE GLOBE HOW COULD BUT IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE THE HARD PRODUCTS DON'T OVER I DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER IN THE VALLEY OF BRAND AND IDEAS
SOMETHING THAT THE U.K. DOES A FANTASTIC JOB OF DOING IS COMING UP WITH GREAT IDEAS EXPORTING THEM IT DOESN'T APPLY VAST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THOUGH DOES IT IN THE WAY THAT THE MARCH OF MAKER'S HAT WOULD IF HE'D WORKED WE WERE SAYING A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DIGITAL JOB SO ONE POINT FIVE SIX MILLION PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN THE DIGITAL SECTOR WITHIN THE U.K. AND HOW DOES HOW DOES THAT COMPARE WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN ENGINEERING IN MANUFACTURING JUST LOOKING AT MY THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE TWO POINT SIX MILLION RIGHT SO YOU'RE YOU'RE CATCHING UP
WE WERE CATCHING UP IT'S NOT A RACE EITHER TOGETHER IT'S HOW WE NEED TO WORK IT'S NOT OLD VERSUS NEW IT'S OLD AND NEW EVOLVING TOGETHER WORKING COLLABORATIVELY BUT DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THAT ULTIMATELY WE WILL SEE MORE PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THE DIGITAL SECTOR THAT'S THE RIGHT EXPRESSION OF THE TEXT IF YOU WHATEVER THAN IN WHAT WE NOW CALL MANUFACTURING AND I CAN SEE THAT THAT THERE TO BLEED TOGETHER
WELL IT'S EXACTLY WHAT SARAH SAYS I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS IS THAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE TO ADOPT THIS NEW WAVE OF DIGITISATION AND KNOW HOW THEY USE IT AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT IN THEIR BUSINESSES TO GET THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED HELP WITH FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING WITHIN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IN THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED PHIL ABOUT OLDHAM SARAH WOULD
NEXT THE TIME TWENTY TWO MINUTES DATE TIME FOR LITTLE PAPERS UNDER THE HEADLINE FLIGHT OF THE STRIKE DOCTORS THE DAILY MAIL SAYS JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND ARE THREATENING A MASS EXODUS TO AUSTRALIA AFTER THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT FORCED THROUGH THEIR NEW CONTRACT ACCORDING TO THE PAPER NEARLY TWO HUNDRED DOCTORS A WEEK WERE ISSUED WITH CERTIFICATES TO PRACTISE ABROAD IN THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF THIS YEAR THE PAPERS
EACH OF THEM HAS HAD THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF TRAINING BEFORE THEY GO AND ASK AT THEY PLEASE PAY BACK EVERY PENNY THIS COST THE TAXPAYER THE SUN SUGGESTS THE DOCTORS' UNION THE B.M.A. IS NOW THREATENING ALL OUT STRIKE ACTION WHICH COULD INVOLVE REFUSING TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY COVER THE GUARDIAN SPEAKS OF THE DOCTOR'S VOWING TO FIGHT ON BUT SAYS THE B.M.A. IS UNSURE ABOUT IT'S HER NEXT MOVE AND COULD BE FORCED TO HOLD A SECOND BALLOT IBID PLANS MORE WALKER SAYS
BUT AS WELL AS THE OPTION OF GOING OVERSEAS MANY DOCTORS COULD HEAD TO SCOTLAND OR WALES OR QUIT ALTOGETHER THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND THE GUARDIAN BOTH REPORT THAT DAVID CAMERON HAS DECIDED TO DELAY A COMMONS VOTE ON RENEWING THE TRIDENT NUCLEAR WEAPONS SYSTEM UNTIL AFTER THE REFERENDUM ON BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. DESPITE PRESSURE FROM THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE AND TORY BACKBENCHERS TO HOLD THE VOTE SOON THE TELEGRAPH SAYS IT WON'T BE HELD UNTIL THE SUMMER AT THE EARLIEST TO GOVERNMENT SOURCE IS QUOTED AS SAYING THIS CARNAGE IN LABOUR AROUND THIS WHAT'S THE RUSH
THE GUARDIAN OF THE PRIME MINISTER BELIEVES THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WOULD COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO BUILD A STRONG NATIONAL CONSENSUS BEHIND RENEWAL GOOGLE'S TAX ARRANGEMENTS CONTINUE TO GENERATE LOTS OF COMMENT THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S EUROPEAN CHIEF MATT BRITAIN TO REVEAL TO A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S YESTERDAY HOW MUCH HE PAID
PROVOKED MUCH GUFF FALLING PULL THE OTHER ONE SAYS THE MAIL THE INDEPENDENT THINKS A MORE SIGNIFICANT REVELATION CAME WHEN H.M.O.S HE'S HEAD OF BUSINESS TAX ADMITTED HE SIMPLY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THE GOOGLE HAD MADE AN HONEST MISTAKE IN NOT PAYING ANY TAX FOR A DECADE THE SUN HIGHLIGHTS IN ADDITION BY THE OUTGOING BOSS OF H.M.R.C. LYNN HOME THAT SHE'S NOT A TAX EXPERT IN SPITE OF BEING IN CHARGE OF COLLECTING BRITAIN'S TAXES THEY MAY BE WIPED OUT
FORTY FORTY YEARS AGO IT'S A BIT MORE THAN WHAT IT IS A CARE ANYWAY IT'S GREY LITERAL ISN'T IT NEANDERTHALS HAD LEFT A LASTING MARK ON US OR HEALTH
THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS SCIENTISTS IN THE U.S. HAVE COMPLAINED HAVE COMPARED THE D.N.A. OF MODERN HUMANS WITH THAT OF NEIGH UNDER TUNNELS AND FOUND THAT AS WELL AS CLUBBING PEOPLE OVER THE HEAD OUR PREDECESSORS PASSED ON BAD GENES LINKED TO ADDICTIONS OBESITY AND DEPRESSION THE MIRROR'S SUMS UP THEIR FINDINGS FAT DEPRESSED AND ADDICTED TO FAGS YOU REALLY ARE A CASE
IT IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT VOTING FOR THE BRIT AWARDS STARTS NEXT WEEK SPECIFICALLY THE BEST BREAKTHROUGH ACT ON THE MUSIC SCENE AND NOT ONE OF THE NOMINEES IS FROM GRIME THAT'S THE BRITISH VERSION OF HIP HOP AND THAT INTERESTING EVEN IF THAT TYPE OF MUSIC ISN'T YOUR THING BECAUSE IT'S MASSIVELY POPULAR WITH MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND YET THE MUSIC ESTABLISHMENT THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE BRITE AWARDS ARE TURNING THEIR BACKS ON IT THANK YOU
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE SOMETHING NEW COMES ALONG JAZZ ROCK'N'ROLL WHATEVER AND THE ESTABLISHMENT TRIES TO PRETEND IT'S NOT HAPPENING OR WORSE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS TO PETER DOHERTY IS A CULTURAL HISTORIAN OF THE AUTHOR OF ELECTRIC SHOCK FROM THE GRAMOPHONE TO THE A EUPHONIUM AND LISTENING TO SOME OF THE MUSIC THE BRITISH CROWD HAS IGNORED
I'VE GOT THOSE IF THAT MAKES ME A LIKE ON THE WILL SORT THEM OUT IT'S A THEME THAT RUNS BACK THROUGH MUSICAL HISTORY WHEN I WAS DOING MY RESEARCH OVER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE YEARS I DISCOVERED IF YOU GO RIGHT BACK TO THE END OF THE VICTORIAN ERA THE BIRTH OF RAGTIME THE ESTABLISHMENT PARENTS CHURCHMEN POLITICIANS WERE OUTRAGED BY THIS AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSIC COMING INTO OUR HOMES
THAT'S HER THAT'S THE QUEEN QUAINT IF ANYTHING IT'S THE GOOD OLD DAYS HARD TO SEE ANYTHING DAMAGING THAT INDEED BUT IT CONTAINS THE MAGICAL INGREDIENT OF SYNCOPATION THROWING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR NORMAL SORT OF EVERY DAY HEARTBEAT RHYTHM
WHEN THIS WAS REGARDED AS BEING SO SHOCKING SO OUTLANDISH AND SO EXOTIC AND SO FOREIGN IT SEEMS TO HAVE UPSET AND OUTRAGED PEOPLE WELL YES HE HEARS WHAT TERM AN AMERICAN DOCTOR MAUDLIN
SO THE BUDGET THESE SILLY DANCERS ARE PHYSICALLY BAD AS WELL AS MORALLY BAD RAGTIME AND TANGO DANCERS WOULD DEMORALISE THE FIGURE OF A GREEK GODDESS AND TRANSFORM HER TO THE SHAPE OF A SACK OF POTATOES PETER THAT THAT HIS RIDICULOUS VIEWED FROM
THIS PERSPECTIVE UTTERLY PREPOSTEROUS BUT BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT HISTORY THAT THAT SORT OF ATTITUDE PERSISTED YOUNG LADIES USED TO DANCE TO RAGTIME AND IN ORDER TO DO SO THEY USED TO LOOSEN THE UNDERGARMENT AND SO THIS IS THE FIRST STAGE TOWARDS IMMORALITY SLABS OF CIVILISATIONS LIKE THAT YES I DID AND WHERE DID IT MOVED FROM THERE THERE WHAT WAS THE NEXT ONE THAT THEY WERE SHOCKED BY THEIR ARE SOON HAPPY'S JUST STARTED TO GET USED TO WRITE TIME THEN ALONG CAME JAZZ
WHICH WAS WILDER SOUNDED MORE AFRICAN IF YOU LIKE AND THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE STARTED COMPARING THE JAZZ MUSICIANS WITH
APES AND GORILLAS AND GOLLIWOGS AND ALWAYS AWFUL RACIAL STEREOTYPES BECAUSE IT WAS THE STARS WERE BLACK AND THEIR FANS BLOODY DUKE ELLINGTON OF COURSE WHAT FOR MY MONEY THE GREATEST THEY WERE BLACK AND THEY WERE VERY QUICKLY COPIED BY WHITE MUSICIANS BUT EVEN THE WHITE MUSICIANS CAME UP AGAINST THE SAME OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY WERE PLAYING THIS JUNGLE MUSIC
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SHOT BY DUKE ELLINGTON WAS THE RECTOR OF AN OXFORD COLLEGE OUR CIVILISATION IS THREATENED BY DREADFUL NOISES HORRIBLE MOTOR TRAFFIC AMERICANISMS
AND JAZZ MUSIC A CIVILISATION MAYBE YOU'RE SERIOUS SOUNDS LIKE THE KIND OF THING MY FATHER USED TO ACTUALLY BUT THEY WERE BEING SERIOUS ENTIRELY SERIOUS THEY REALLY THOUGHT MORAL RUIN WOULD COME FROM YOUNG PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS SYNCOPATED MUSIC WELL LET'S MOVE TO ROCK AND ROLL
THREE O'CLOCK FOUR O'CLOCK RIGHT SIX SEVEN O'CLOCK HERE IN THE PARK RAPID TEN ELEVEN O'CLOCK TWELVE
I CAN REMEMBER GROWN UPS BEING VERY UPSET BY IT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING OUT TEARING UP CINEMA SEATS AND SO ON WHEN THEY HEARD BILL HALEY OR ELVIS PRESLEY ONCE AGAIN I HAD TO KEEP COMING BACK TO IT BUT THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE MUSIC WAS BLACK IN ORIGIN THE ORIGINAL ROCK'N'ROLL MUSIC IN AMERICA WAS BLACK IT WAS THEN PICKED UP BY WHITE MUSICIANS
BUT AS FAR AS THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS CONCERNED THE TAINT WAS STILL THEIR ROCK'N'ROLL IS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FORCE IN THE COUNTRY A LEWD LASCIVIOUS AND LARCENOUS INFLUENCE ON YOUTH AND DID THEY GET UPSET ABOUT OTHER THINGS AS WELL I NEEDED THAT THE RHYTHM YOU YOU'VE SAID THE RHYTHM ITSELF THEY REGARDED AS DANGEROUS THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT THE IDEA OF YOUNG PEOPLE FIRST OF ALL ENJOYING THEMSELVES SECONDLY DANCING AND THROWING THEMSELVES AROUND IN A VAGUELY SEXUAL MANNER
THAT REALLY UPSETS PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT CARRIES ON TO THIS DAY SO NOT JUST RACISM RACISM ALWAYS DID USED TO BE BEHIND THAT I THINK I THINK THESE DAYS WERE MUCH MORE OF A COLOUR BLIND COUNTRY I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO OUR MUSICAL TASTES BUT PERHAPS THE MUSIC BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT ISN'T QUITE SO COLOUR BLIND SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT TODAY DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE LIKE THAT'S NOT ME THAT'S NOT ME I DO ANYTHING IT TENDS TO BE SHOCKING HIS IS THE VOICE OF YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE
MAKING MUSIC THAT TO WHITE UNSCHOOLED EAR SOUNDS AGGRESSIVE OR SOUNDS THREATENING IN SOME WAY THERE IS STILL THAT THE SENSE I THINK AND A SOCIETY THAT ALTHOUGH WE TRY TO BE COLOUR BLIND WHEN THERE ARE YOUNG YOUNG BLACK MEN SHOUTING WE DON'T GO O.K. THEY'RE ACTING IN THE SAME WAY AS MONTH MARLON BRANDO AND ROBERT DE NERO IN GANGSTER MOVIES WE ACTUALLY
SEE IT AS SOME KIND OF THREAT TO REALLY LISTEN TO SOCIETY I THINK SO YES FIRST GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING PETER THE FACT THAT THE BRITS TOWARDS HADN'T HAD ANY NOMINATIONS FOR GRIME I CAN'T SAY I'M SHOCKED BY OR SURPRISED AT ALL I MEAN WHAT THEY ARE AS A MARKETING EXERCISE FOR THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND IT'S A WAY FOR THE MUSIC INDUSTRY TO ADVERTISE ITSELF THE WAY IT WANTS TO BE SEEN
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEREFORE THAT THEY TEND TO CHOOSE ARTISTS WHO ARE SAFE AND CAN REACH A FAMILY AUDIENCE RATHER THAN THOSE WHO ARE PERHAPS SLIGHTLY MORE CUTTING EDGE PETER DOGGED THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
COME ON GIRLS EVERYWHERE
AN ICY ON THE BUS WHAT IS GOING TO HANG ABOUT GOT THAT STUFF I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU
BEFORE WE GO GOOD EXCELLENT TOP I DO JUST LIKE A PAVEMENT
WE USED TO GO DO HAVE GET DONE IN THAT WAY YES I THINK THAT I WAS JOHN WITH HIS OWN PERSONAL BRITS ENTRY YOU MAY OR MAY NOT THINK THEY'LL DO THE JOB THIRTY MINUTES DATE TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER AND A STUDIO THIS MORNING IS RHIDIAN BROOK RIGHT COME ON READY GOOD MORNING
A STUDY FROM YUGO SHOWS THAT THE NUMBER OF PARENTS WHO'D BE UPSET IF THEIR CHILDREN MARRIED OR PARTNERED WITH SOMEONE OF A DIFFERENT POLITICAL PERSUASION HAS DOUBLED IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS I'M NOT SURE IF THE SHOWS THAT POLITICS IS BECOMING MORE POLARISED OR PARENTS BECOMING LESS TOLERANT BUT YOU THINK MOST PARENTS WILL BE PLEASED THAT THE CHILDREN HAD ANY POLITICAL CONVICTIONS SUCH AS THE LOW LEVEL OF POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT BEING SHOWN BY THE YOUNG ACROSS THE DEMOCRATIC WORLD
BUT CHILDREN HAVING DIFFERENT BELIEFS TO THEIR PARENTS ARE SURELY THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN I HAVE DIFFERENT POLITICAL CONVICTIONS TO MY MOTHER I HAVE DIFFERING THEOLOGICAL VIEWS TO THOSE OF MY FATHER AS MY CHILDREN ARE STILL QUESTIONING HOW RELEVANT EITHER OF THESE THINGS ARE
DO I LOVE THEM LESS DO WE STOP DISCUSSING IT LORD I HOPE NOT
OF COURSE MUM KNOWS BEST UNTIL YOU DISAGREE WITH HER I'D BE CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW THE PRIME MINISTER REALLY FEELS ABOUT HIS MOTHER SIGNING A PETITION THIS WEEK AGAINST LOCAL GOVERNMENT CUTS TO CHILDREN'S CENTRES IN HER SON'S CONSTITUENCY
I FIND IT ODDLY REASSURING THAT SHE DID IT'S BETTER TO BE PART OF A FAMILY OR A SOCIETY THAT IS ABLE TO HOLD DIFFERENCE OR INDIFFERENCE INTENTION WHILST CONTINUING TO CARE FOR EACH OTHER
THERE'S NOTHING CREEPIER AND KIDS BLINDLY AGREEING TO EVERYTHING THEIR PARENTS THINK OR PARENTS PRAISING EVERYTHING THEIR CHILDREN DO
THERE IS A CONCEPT IN POLITICAL THEORY KNOWN AS THE OVERTON WINDOW WHICH IS THE SPECTRUM OF IDEAS THAT THE PUBLIC FIND ACCEPTABLE IT'S THE WINDOW IN WHICH POLITICIANS OPERATES
THE POLITICIANS LIKE PARENTS NEED TO KEEP UP WITH CHANGING IDEAS AND THE FACT THAT THE WINDOW CAN MOVE OR GET SMASHED ALL TOGETHER AN IDEA THAT WAS ONCE DEEMED UNTHINKABLE SUCH AS SAME SEX MARRIAGE OR UNIVERSAL FREE HEALTH CARE AT THE POINT OF NEED KAREN IN THE SKIP OF HER GENERATION BECOME POLICY YESTERDAY'S RADICAL IS TODAY'S REASONABLE
IN THEIR CHILDREN PARENTS HAVE TO FACE WHAT POLITICIANS OF ALL PERSUASIONS HAVE TO FACE A SHIFTING SET OF BELIEFS THAT CHALLENGES THEIR VIEW OF THE WORLD AND HOW IT SHOULD BE RUN AS A PARENT YOU CAN SPEND YEARS NURTURING IN INFLUENCING YOUR CHILDREN TRAINING THEM IN THE WAY YOU THINK THEY SHOULD GO AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY TURN TO YOU AND SAY I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU IT MIGHT BE UPSETTING BUT SHOULDN'T WE ALSO WELCOME THIS CHALLENGE
WHEN SCRIPTURE ENCOURAGES CHILDREN TO HONOUR THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER THAT DOESN'T MEAN BELIEVING EVERYTHING THEY BELIEVE IT MEANS LOVING THEM DESPITE WHAT THEY BELIEVE AND WHEN IT EMERGES PARENTS NOT TO PROVOKE OR EXASPERATE THEIR CHILDREN IT'S ASKING THEM TO RESPECT THEIR FLEDGLING THOUGHTS AND REMEMBER THAT THEY SOMETIMES SEE THE WORLD THROUGH A DIFFERENT WINDOW
IN THIS LIFE SOMETHING'S ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PRESERVATION OF OUR CONVICTIONS
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH RHYDIAN BLOCK THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN AT PRIMARY SCHOOLS MAKE REAL PROGRESS AND THE SCHOOLS THAT FAILED THEM UNNOTICED AND CHANGED THEM WHAT'S THE BEST WAY OF ACHIEVING THAT AIM IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS FROM THIS YEAR THE IDEA IS THAT CHILDREN ARE ASSESSED WHEN THEY FIRST ARRIVE AT THE AGE OF FOUR SO THAT THEIR PROGRESS CAN BE MONITORED WHEN THEY GET TO SATS AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN THEY ALREADY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN WALES AND THEY'RE GOING TO START IN SCOTLAND IT'S AN IDEA IT SEEMS
TAKING OFF BUT HOLD ON TEACHING UNIONS HAVE COMMISSIONED A SURVEY WHICH THEY SAY REVEALS HOW DISRUPTIVE AND UNRELIABLE THESE TESTS FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE CHRISTINE BARRIS GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS AND HE'S HERE AND ON THE LINE IS LYNN LIZ MARSDEN WHO'S
THE DIRECTOR OF THE FOUNDER OF EARLY EXCELLENCE WHICH IS THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST PROVIDER OF THESE BASELINE TEST FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS MIND YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING IT'S MILES AND FIRST WILL GIVE US A LUNCH AND AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU DO THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU DO TO CONDUCT THE TEST
OH KAY WERE FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT OUR SOLUTION TO THE BASELINE IS FOR THAT TEACHERS DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY TESTS OR ANY PRESET TASKS WHATSOEVER THE FOCUS OF OUR APPROACH TO BASELINE IS AS CHILDREN ARRIVE IN SCHOOL TEACHERS DO WHAT THEY DO EVERY DAY THEY WELCOME CHILDREN THEY GET TO KNOW THEIR CHILDREN THEY SETTLE THEIR CHILDREN IN AND OVER A PERIOD OF SIX WEEKS THEY AS THEY GET TO KNOW THOSE CHILDREN THEY FIND OUT WHAT THEY CAN DO IN ORDER THAT THEY CAN THEN THINK ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT THEM
AND WITHIN THAT TIME TEACHERS ARE AS THEY GET TO KNOW CHILDREN ARE WORKING OUT IN RELATION TO OUR ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS WHETHER CHILDREN CAN DO THOSE THINGS OR WHETHER THEY NEED TO BE MORE SUPPORT WHAT KIND OF THINGS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN'S CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WHETHER CHILDREN ARE CURIOUS WHETHER THEY CAN TAKE RISKS WHETHER THEY CAN PERSIST WHERE THEY CONCENTRATE GENERATE IDEAS WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THEIR PERSONAL EMOTIONAL SKILLS THEIR PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT
HOW WELL DEVELOP THEIR COMMUNICATION LANGUAGES AS WELL AS SOME CONCEPT EARLY CONCEPTS ARE LANDRY LITERACY AND MOUTH RIGHT SO THEN COUNT A FEW NUMBERS AND THAT SORT OF THING THAT MAYBE THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HE ASKED WHETHER A CHILD CAN COUNT FOR EXAMPLE LEAST FOR OBJECTS AND SO A TEACHER THEN HAS TO FILL IN THIS FORM AFTER THEY HAVE GOT TO KNOW THE CHILD HOW LONG HOW LONG DOES THE PROCESS TAKE
WELL THE PROCESS OF ACTUALLY GETTING TO KNOW CHILDREN IS THE SAME PROCESS THAT EVERY TEACHER WOULD GO THROUGH ANYWAY SO WITHIN THAT EARLY PERIOD OF SIX WEEKS IT HAS SIX WEEKS SIX WEEKS AFTER THEY'VE ARRIVED SIX SIX RIGHT TEA YES TEACHERS WOULD BE SITTING DOWN THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CHILDREN CAN ACHIEVE THOSE THINGS CHRISTINE BLOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
WELL LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL THAT LIZ DOES MAKE THAT SOUND COMPLETELY REASONABLE AND WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU IS THAT THERE IS ALREADY AND HAS BEEN FOR SOME YEARS IN SCHOOL A SYSTEM CALLED THE EARLY YEARS FOUNDATION STAGE PROFILE ON WHICH EARLY EXCELLENCE WAS LARGELY BASED THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT LIZ MARSDEN DESCRIBES THE PROCESS BUT ACTUALLY ALL OF THAT HAS TO BE REDUCED TO A SINGLE NUMBER
THE CHILD JUST RECEIVES A SINGLE NUMBER AND IT IS AGAINST THAT NUMBER THAT THE SCHOOL WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE SOME SEVEN YEARS LATER THE OTHER THING IS OF COURSE THAT ALTHOUGH SHE SAYS IT'S OVER THE SIX WEEKS IF YOU IF YOU ASSESS HER CHILD IN WEEK ONE
THEY WILL KNOW SIX WEEKS' WORTH LESS THAN THERE WERE CHILD THAT YOU ASSESS IN WEEK SIX AND THE FACT IS THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND THE EVIDENCE FROM OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT A LOT OF TEACHERS DIDN'T DO ANY TEACHING OVER THOSE SIX WEEKS
BECAUSE ACTUALLY THEY DIDN'T WANT CHILDREN TO LEARN THINGS THAT THE CHILDREN IN WEEK ONE DIDN'T KNOW YOU JUST THIS I'M BACK ON THOSE TWO POINTS LES MASTER INTERESTING ONES ARE THE NUMBER ONE THAT IF YOU ASSESS A CHILD RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS NOT FOUND THAT CHILD AND A NUMBER TWO THAT THAT ACTUALLY IT ALL BOILS DOWN DOES IT TO ONE NUMBER
WELL FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE ARRIVING IN THE RECEPTION CLASS FOR THE FIRST TIME NEED TIME TO SETTLE IN CHILDREN ARE NOT GOING TO EXHIBIT WHAT THEY KNOW AND UNDERSTAND EARLY IF THEY'RE NOT SETTLED AND COMFORTABLE SO THE ADVICE THAT WE GIVE WITHIN OUR ASSESSMENT IS THAT YOU ASSESS THOSE CHILDREN WHO SETTLE QUICKLY PERHAPS THEY'VE BEEN IN THAT SCHOOL NURSERY IN THEY'RE COMING INTO THE RECEPTION CLASS SO THEY'RE MORE COMFORTABLE
YOU CAN ASSESS THOSE CHILDREN EARLY BECAUSE THEY WILL EXHIBIT WHAT THEY KNOW AND CAN DO THE REASON WHY YOU MIGHT LEAVE IT LONGER FOR CHILDREN PERHAPS NOT TO MAKE YOUR FINAL ASSESSMENTS UNTIL WEEK FIVE A WEEK SIX IS TO GIVE THE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT A SETTLED TIME TO BE SETTLED AND EXHIBIT WHAT THEY NOW SOUNDS A BIT CHAOTIC THOUGH IF YOU ARE GOING TO BASE THESE TERRIBLY IMPORTANT DECISIONS IN LATER ON WHEN THE CHILDREN HAVE GOT TO THEIR SATS ABOUT WHETHER A SCHOOL IS FAILING OR NOT BASED ON WHAT IT'S PRETTY SUBJECTIVE AND MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY MY GOODNESS BY ILLNESS BY ALL SORTS OF THINGS
NO IT'S NOT SUBJECTIVE WE NEED TO TRUST PRACTITIONER JUDGEMENT DAY WITH THE PROFESSION IS HIGHLY SKILLED AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR TEACHING THAT TEACHERS THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE ASSESSMENT AND WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE BOILS DOWN TO ONE NUMBER IS THAT THE CASE
WELL IN ORDER FOR FOR SCHOOLS TO LOOK AT THEIR COHORT OF CHILDREN THAT IS ALL THAT THE BASELINE IS INTERESTED IN IT'S NOT LOOKING AT A NUMBER FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CHILD IT'S LOOKING AT A GROUP OF CHILDREN AND THINKING ABOUT THAT GROUP OF CHILDREN AND THEN SAYING HOW MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN CAN DO THESE THINGS WHEN THEY ARRIVE HOW MANY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND THEN LOOKING AT WHETHER THE GOOD AND OUTSTANDING TEACHING OFF THAT SCHOOL HAS SUPPORTED THOSE CHILDREN AS THEY MOVE THROUGH SCHOOL WHAT ONE OF YOUR RESPONSE KRISTIAN
TO THE TO YOUR SURVEY THAT YOU COMMISSION SAID THERE'S NO TIME GIVEN TO THESE POOR LITTLE CHILDREN TO SETTLE IN BEFORE THEY'RE ASSESS THEM IN OUR SCHOOL THEY'RE PUT INTO ABILITY GROUPS BASED ON THESE RESULTS AND IT'S ACTUALLY OVER EXAGGERATING ISN'T IT THE KIND OF PRESSURE THAT A CHILD IS UNDER COS THESE CHILDREN AREN'T GOING TO KNOW THEY'RE BEING US
I THINK THEY WILL KNOW THAT THEY'RE BEING ASSESSED AS ALSO PART OF THE ORDINARY DULL THERE'S A COMMENT THERE'S A COMMENT FROM ONE TEACHER AND YOU YOU PICKED UP ONE BUT I'M PICKING OUT OTHERS WHERE HER CHILD WAS PUT IN FRONT OF A SCREEN AND ASKED TO READ SOMETHING AND THEY JUST BURST INTO TEARS AND SAID I CAN'T READ NOW OF COURSE LIZ DOES MAKE IT SOUND TERRIBLY REASONABLE BUT OUR RESEARCH SHOWS
SIXTY PER CENT OF TEACHERS DIDN'T THINK THE BASELINE SCHOOLS GAVE THEM AN ACCURATE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF CHILDREN'S ATTAINMENTS AND ACTUALLY THAT'S QUITE A BIG PROBLEM HOW DO HOW DO
WELL THE THING IS YOU KNOW DON'T YOU WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHETHER HER SCHOOL'S DOING WELL I'M NOT WELL I'VE PUT PROVIDING THE KIND OF VALUE THAT PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY ARRIVE IN SCHOOL THAT WE FIND OUT THOSE THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO AND THOSE THINGS THAT WERE WHERE THEY NEED ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT AND THE EARLY YEARS FOUNDATION STAGE IS DOING
THIS YEAR TWENTY THOUSAND THIRTY THOUSAND SCHOOLS TWO THOUSAND SCHOOLS DIDN'T DO THIS BASELINE ASSESSMENT IT'S NOT MANDATORY WE'RE ACTUALLY HOPING THAT MORE SCHOOLS DON'T DO IT NEXT YEAR WHEN IT ALSO WHEN WILL WE KNOW HOW WELL WE KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB ON WELL BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS WATCH WHAT THEY'RE DOING YOU CAN'T DO IT BY A SINGLE SCHOOL HOW CAN WE WATCH WHAT THEY'RE DOING IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY COME METRICS TO MEASURE BUT THE THING IS
A CHILD'S A CHILD'S WHOLE CAPACITY TO LEARN CANNOT BE REDUCED TO A SINGLE NUMBER AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM NO GONNA BURN THE MOWING UNDERSTAND THAT PUB YOU'VE GOT TO BE GOT TO MEASURE IT SOMEHOW HAVE NEW THAT'S WHAT PARENTS TO BE SELLING WELL SURELY WHAT YOU DO IS MEASURE YEAR ON YEAR HOW THEY ARE PROGRESSING THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT YOU DO THAT IS WHAT TEACHERS DO AND LIZ JUST SAID YOU HAVE TO TRUST TEACHERS DO YOU NEED A BASELINE SOMEWHERE DON'T YOU ISN'T THAT THE POINT NOT A SINGLE NUMBER
NOT A SINGLE NUMBER AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM AND THE OTHER THING IS OF COURSE SHE SAYS THAT THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF INTERVAL GED INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN IT'S ABOUT SCHOOLS AND WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH TURNOVER THERE HE'S ALL RIGHT SO IF YOU'VE GOT THOSE NUMBERS FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS
THEY MAY NOT BE THE SAME FOUR YEAR OLD THEY MAY NOT BE THE SAME ELEVEN YEAR OLD ESTEEM AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THOUGH WEATHER FORECAST BUT JOHN THANK YOU MORNING TO YOU WELL A CHILL IN THE AIR TODAY AND GET USED TO IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO STAY QUITE COLD THROUGH THE NEXT FEW DAYS SOME WINTRY SHOWERS AT TIMES AS WELL BEGINNING TODAY'S FORECAST IN SOUTH WEST ENGLAND HERE SOME OUTBREAKS OF RAIN CLOSE TO THE SOUTH COAST PARTICULARLY BUT EVEN AWAY FROM THAT IT'S GOING TO STAY CLOUDY THROUGH TODAY THERE'LL BE SOME SHOWERY RAIN AT TIMES FOR SOUTH EAST ENGLAND WALES THE MIDLANDS EASTERN ENGLAND

A STUDY SUGGESTS MANY TEACHERS BELIEVE TESTING CHILDREN AS THEY START PRIMARY SCHOOL LIST DISRUPTIVE AND AN UNRELIABLE MEANS OF MEASURING SCHOOL PERFORMANCE SOME SCHOOLS HAVE PILOTED THE ASSESSMENTS OF FOUR AND FIVE YEAR OLDS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE WIDELY ADOPTED FROM SEPTEMBER THE N.U.T. AND THE EIGHTY L. UNIONS COMMISSIONED RESEARCH WHICH INDICATES THERE'S DEEP UNEASE ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE TESTS IS OUR EDUCATION EDITOR BRAN WITH JEFFERIES
IF YOUR CHILD STARTS SCHOOL IN ENGLAND THIS SEPTEMBER THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE ASSESSED IN THE FIRST SIX WEEKS IN FUTURE THEIR PROGRESS FROM THAT BASELINE TO SCIENCE TESTS AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN WILL BE ONE OF THE MAIN PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR SCHOOLS THE N.U.T. AND DAY TO YELL UNIONS SAY THE SYSTEM IS MODELLED WITH THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ASSESSMENTS BEING PILOTED
MOST SCHOOLS HAVE CHOSEN ONE BASED ON OBSERVATION THE UNIONS ALSO SAY THE RESULTS ARE CRUDE AS THEY RELY ON DECIDING WHETHER A CHILD CAN OR CAN'T DO SOMETHING ON A GIVEN DAY NONE OF THIS IS LIKELY TO DETER MINISTERS WHO ARGUE THEY DON'T WANT TO OVER TEST CHILDREN BUT DO NEED TO MAKE SURE NONE FAILED TO MASTER BASIC SKILLS WALES ALREADY HAS BASELINE TESTING AND SCOTLAND IS REINTRODUCING NATIONAL TESTS IN PRIMARY SCHOOL
POLICE HAVE ARRESTED THE PARTNER OF THE FORMER EASTENDERS ACTRESS SION BLAKE ON SUSPICION OF MURDERING HER AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARTHUR SIMPSON KENT WAS DETAINED AT HEATHROW AIRPORT THIS MORNING AFTER FLYING BACK FROM GHANA THE BODIES OF MISS BLAKE AND HER SONS WERE FOUND IN THE GARDEN OF THEIR HOME IN SOUTH EAST LONDON IN DECEMBER
LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR OLDER PEOPLE IS THE HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN FOR THE FIRST TIME PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND HAS CALCULATED THE PROJECTED LIFE SPANS FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY PENSIONERS ANANDA REPORTS
IT'S NO SECRET THAT WE'RE LIVING LONGER BUT LIFE EXPECTANCY IS USUALLY MEASURED FROM BIRTH THESE FIGURES FROM PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND GIVE A SNAPSHOT FOR OLDER PEOPLE SAYING THAT MEN AGED SIXTY FIVE WILL LIVE ON AVERAGE TO BE EIGHTY FOUR WOMEN THE SAME AGE ON AVERAGE TO BE EIGHTY SIX AND THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE EIGHTY FIVE CAN EXPECT A FURTHER SIX AND SEVEN YEARS RESPECTIVELY
BUT RESEARCHERS ADMIT THAT STATISTICS FOR THOSE OVER NINETY FIVE OR LESS RELIABLE SINCE BIRTH RECORDS FROM AROUND THE TIME OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR OFTEN WRONG THERE ARE UNEXPLAINED REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN THE SOUTH AND EAST OF ENGLAND LIFE EXPECTANCY IS AROUND A YEAR LONGER THAN IN THE NORTH THE INCREASES LESS IN THE NORTH EAST THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
THEN ADD A REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT THE LATEST ESTIMATE IS THAT NEARLY HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED HALF THE ENTIRE POPULATION HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES SYRIA IS THE GREATEST TRAGEDY OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND NOW THERE IS AT LEAST THE FAINTEST GLIMMER OF HOPE JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT IN MUNICH FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM SEVENTEEN COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA
AGREED ON WHAT THEY CALLED A NATIONWIDE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES TO BEGIN IN A TARGET OF ONE WEEK OF COURSE THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS SAYING THE PARTY'S ON THE GROUND THEY'VE AGREED TO END THE FIGHTING AND INDEED RUSSIA WILL STILL ATTACK ICES TARGETS BUT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING AT MINISTERS ALSO AGREED ON A PLAN TO SEND DESPERATELY NEEDED FOOD AND MEDICINES TO BESIEGED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY STARVING
OUR CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT LISE DO SAID IS IN MUNICH AS I SPEAK THESE I SAID THAT IT IS BETTER THAN NOTHING IS THAT THE VIEW BEHIND THE SCENES
CERTAINLY JOHN IT IS BETTER THAN NOTHING BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S MORE THAN THAT THIS IS A CONFLICT WHERE WORDS MATTER AND SYMBOLISM MATTERS AND THEY ARE NOW COMING FROM ALL OF THE MAIN PLAYERS SEVENTEEN IN ALL OF US AT THE SYRIANS WHO WERE AT THE TABLE
BUT WHEN YOU GET SERGEI LAVROV AND JOHN KERRY SAYING WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS WERE PROUD OF THIS PROGRESS BUT SAYING IT IS ALL NEAT PROGRESS ON PAPER IT IS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE WORDS THAT THE REAL CHALLENGE LIES
IN FOR THE BRITISH FOR EXAMPLE WHO PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE STARKS IT REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO RUSSIA RUSSIA HAS TO STOP BOMBING GROUP SAID DESCRIBES THIS TERRORIST BUT WHICH ACTUALLY ARE PARTS OF THE OPPOSITION ARRAY OF OPPOSITION GROUPS YOU'RE EXPECTED TO PLAY A FUTURE ROLE IN HER IN ANOTHER KIND BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT
THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN PERMISSION AS IT WERE TO CONTINUE BOMBING I S. TARGETS AS INDEED BRITAIN IS GOING TO CONTINUE BOMBING THOSE TARGETS IN SYRIA AND IRAQ
THERE WAS A LOT OF VERY DIFFICULT DISCUSSION IN THOSE HOURS OF TALKS HERE IN MUNICH WHICH GROUPS CAN BE DESCRIBED AS TERRORISTS THEY HAVE THEY HAVE EMPHASISED THAT BAD DEFINITION FALLS UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL SANCTIONED SO THOSE ARE THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THE OLD CLYDE ARE LINKED MISRA FRONT AND ANY OF THE OTHER GROUPS WHICH ARE ALSO AFFILIATED TO AL COLLIDER THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE TARGETS IN THE BATTLE AGAINST TERRORISM TO USE RUSSIA'S FREE
ANYONE ELSE HE'S NOT A TARGET IF ANY OF THE OTHER GROUPS AROUND LET'S SEE ALEPPO ARE BOMBED THEN THEY RUSSIA'S BLUFF WILL BE CALLED THAT IS THE BIG BIG QUESTION MARK WHAT DOES RUSSIA ONE TWITCHY WILL THEY USE THE NEXT WEEK
TO TRY TO STRENGTHEN AGAIN THE POSITIONS AND PRESIDENT ASSAD'S MILITARY WHICH IS MAKE BEEN MAKING GAINS AROUND TO SERIOUS SECOND CITY SO THAT THEY ARE IN THE KIND OF MILITARY POSITION THAT WILL MEANS THAT THEY WILL HAVE THE OVERWHELMING FORCE AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE SHOULD THEY GO BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AND THE QUICK THOUGHT
RUSSIA'S BLUFF WILL BE CALLED MEANING WHAT
WE NEED TO SAY I'LL BE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT TRYING TO MOVE TOWARDS A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OR ARE THEY RIGHT NOW JUST TRYING TO STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF PRESIDENT ASSAD'S FORCES WHICH WILL MAKE PEACE TALKS ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE END OF RUSSIA HAS MORE EVENT SYRIA INTO INNIT SITE THIS IS ABOUT A BIG STRATEGIC AMBITION FOR A BRUSH
IT'S ABOUT ITS ROLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST EVERYONE IS COMMENTING ON HOW IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS RUSSIA HAS RETURNED TO THE MIDDLE EAST IN A WAY THAT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES
FOR SOME THEY SAY THIS IS CRIMEA AND UKRAINE THEY ARE GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT AGAIN THEY'RE USING MILITARY FORCE TO ACHIEVE THEIR AMBITIONS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO ABOUT SYRIA IT ALSO HAS TO DO A BOOK RUSSIA'S ROYAL ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE IT IS ABOUT RUSSIAN POWER AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SUCCEEDING IN SOME WAY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT LET'S TURN TO TWO SEASONED DIPLOMAT LORD WILLIAMS MICHAEL WILLIAMS USED TO BE UNITED NATIONS UNDER SECRETARY GENERAL AND PETER FORD WHO WAS BRITAIN'S AMBASSADOR TO SYRIA FOR THREE YEARS FROM TWO THOUSAND THREE TO TWO THOUSAND SIX PETER FORD WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS ARE YOU IMPRESSED
MUNICH PEACE IN OUR TIME DEFINITELY NOT IS IT DIVIDE AND RULE QUITE POSSIBLY I THINK THE KEY HERE IS THAT
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT GROUP AFFILIATED TO AL COLLIDER AND IT IS LEGITIMATE TO CONTINUE BOMBING IT AND HOWEVER WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE NUMBER OF THE SO CALLED MODERATE GROUPS NOW THIS AGREEMENT IS GOING TO SET THE CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS AMONG BALL THE REBELS INCLUDING ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WORK HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE MUSTARD
THEY ARE GOING TO GET HIT IF THEY CONTINUE TO WORK ALONGSIDE IN THE DESIGNATED AREAS I THINK RUSSIA IS BEING QUITE CLEVER I THINK THE GAME ACTUALLY IS TO TRY TO SPLIT THE SO CALLED MODERATE SO PART OF THE SO CALLED MODERATE AWAY FROM
SO THAT THE SYRIAN ARMY WHICH SUFFERS FROM DEPLETED MANPOWER CAN TACKLE
NOT LORD WILLIAMS WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT
GOOD MORNING JOHN I THINK THIS IS A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT MOVE WHEN WE LAST BOOK ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE DAYS AGO AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT THE TWO SUPERPOWERS ALMOST IN A COLD WAR FASHION HAVE TAKEN OWNERSHIP OF THE PROBLEM
IT MAY NOT WORK FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT PETER FORD OUTLINE DRESSED THEN BUT EVEN IF THE BALL IS DROPPED NOW THEY HAVE THEY HAVE TO PICK IT UP AGAIN
THERE'S NO GOING BACK ON THIS AND IT'S ALSO I THINK A WARNING SHOT TO A SAD
IS IT SIGNIFICANT THAT AMERICA PERHAPS THIS ISN'T WHAT HAS HAPPENED CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG AMERICA SEEMS TO HAVE ACCEPTED THAT THEIR ORIGINAL AMBITION OUR ORIGINAL AMBITION WAS TO GET RID OF IT SEND HIM OFF TO SWITZERLAND OR WHATEVER AND FIND PEACE THAT WAY
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT HIM AND THE AMBITION NOW IS TO END THIS WAR TO END THE HORROR THAT'S GOING ON AROUND ALEPPO AND ELSEWHERE IN SYRIA AND TO HELP STEM LOOK AT THE CONCEN TIRED OF REFUGEES AND THAT'S ONLY GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S ONLY GOING TO HAPPEN IT WAS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW AND THAT TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT WILL MEAN THAT THE U.S. AND U.K. FOR THAT MATTER WILL HAVE TO HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT WITH A SAD IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
NOT PEACE IN OUR TIME PETER FORD BUT A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS IT ON PUTTING WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH IN INDEED I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS IS NOT A POLITICAL TRANSITION TOWARDS THUMB END GAME IN WHICH I SAID STEPS DOWN WHAT WITH THING ACTUALLY IS THAT TRANSITION IN WHICH THE AMERICAN POSITION IS CHANGING
YOU CAN SENSE THIS IN THEIR WORDS NOT USED BY KERRY HE'S MORE OR LESS STOPPED DEMANDING THAT THIRD SHOULD STEP DOWN
IN FACT THE BRITISH ARE ONE STEP BEHIND BUT OF COURSE THE BRITISH HAVE A TRIDENT RELATED AGENDA OF THEIR OWN TO DEMONISE RUSSIA
RIGHT BUT BUT IMPORTANT SORRY GO ON YOU WERE SAYING
I THINK THAT PHILIP HAMMOND MADE A TYPICALLY THOWRA COMMENT AFTER HELEN SECRETARY COULD ONLY FIND NEGATIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT RUSSIA BUT THIS OF COURSE THERE HAS TO BE SEEN AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT NEED TO RAMP UP FEAR AND LOATHING OF RUSSIA BECAUSE THEY HAVE RENEWAL OF TRIDENT COMING UP MICHAEL WILLIAMS WHAT SINGLE WORD WOULD YOU USE TO CHARACTERISE WESTERN ATTITUDES TOWARDS THIS WHOLE CONFLICT
AND REALPOLITIK MICHAEL WILLIAMS I WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE NOW IS REMIND ME OF CHURCHILL TALKING ABOUT EL ALAMEIN IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO IT'S NOT THE BEGINNING OF THE END BUT IT IS THE END OF THE BEGINNING AND THE CLEAR POLITICAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN MOSCOW AND WASHINGTON THAT THIS HAS TO BE SOLVED THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANY REAL PROGRESS
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS OR PERHAPS NOT EVEN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BUT THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL NOW IS VERY CLEAR AND THAT HAS CONSEQUENCES ON THE GROUND AS AS PETER OUTLINE BOTH FOR A SAD AND FOR THE OPPOSITION SO WHAT IS THE NEXT CONCRETE STEP FORWARD BEAUTIFUL
WELL THEY WERE GOING TO BE INTENSE TALK NOW WORKING GROUP SET UP TO IMPLEMENT THE HUMANITARIAN CONDITION THERE'S A REASONABLE CHANCE SOME OF APPLE WILL GO AHEAD AND AS I SAID EARLIER THE CAT HAS BEEN FELT AMONG THE PIGEONS AT THE OPPOSITION WE WAIT TO SEE WHETHER THE OPPOSITION ARE READY TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND DELIVER HEATH FIRES IN AREAS CLEARLY RUSSIA CAN FOURTH
TO COMPLY THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM THE ONUS IS NOW ON THE OPPOSITION TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN DELIVER HEATH FIRES DO BELIEVE
NO I DON'T THINK THEY WILL IN WHICH CASE IT'S BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
LORD WILLIAMS I WOULDN'T TAKE THAT ACT I THINK A PROCESS IS UNDERWAY NOW IS IT GOING TO BE DIFFICULT CAN BE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT AND PETER IS RIGHT A SAD A SAD CAN BE DELIVERED BY MY PUTIN
BUT I THINK NEVERTHELESS WE WILL SEE PROGRESS AND PARTICULARLY IF AS THE UN IS HOPING WE CAN SEE REAL HUMANITARIAN PROGRESS AND ACCESS TO SOME OF THE BESIEGED TOWNS AND CITIES IN THE COMING DAYS
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED PETER FORD BIKER WILLIAMS THANK YOU BUT LOOK AT THE TIME TWENTY PAST EIGHT THIS TIME NEXT WEEK DAVID CAMERON WILL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME NEGOTIATIONS ARE BRITAIN'S TERMS OF MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE PRIME MINISTER MAKING HIS LAST BIG SPEECH AHEAD OF THOSE TALKS TODAY IN HAMBURG
HE'S ALSO GONNA MAKE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL GERMANY IS IT'S ABOUT A CLOSE YOU CAN GET ISN'T IT TO A EUROPEAN SUPERPOWER AND YET THE MIGRATION CRISIS HAS PUT CHANCELLOR MERKEL UNDER AN AWFUL LOT OF PRESSURE IN RECENT MONTHS SO HOW DOES GERMANY NOW VIEW BRITAIN'S RENEGOTIATION HOPES HOW MUCH HELP
HIS CHANCELLOR MERKEL GOING TO BE TO THE PRIME MINISTER A EUROPE EDITOR CATCH ADLER REPORTS
THERE'S A SAYING IN THIS STRIDENT PORT CITY THAT WHEN IT RAINS IN THE U.K. THE ANGLOPHILE PEOPLE OF HAMBURG OPEN THEIR UMBRELLAS
TRADE AND CULTURAL LINKS WITH LONDON DATE BACK CENTURIES AND IT'S IN THIS SYMBOLIC SETTING NOT IN BERLIN THAT ANGELA MERKEL HAS CHOSEN TO HOST DAVID CAMERON DAYS BEFORE HIS NEW E.U. DEAL FOR THE U.K. GOES TO THE VOTE AT A SUMMIT OF EUROPEAN LEADERS
OUT OF THE FREEZING DAMP HAMBURG COAL
AND INTERVENE NEO RENAISSANCE SPLENDOUR OF HAMBURG'S CITY HALL
IT'S HUGE AND TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE WITH ITS STONE PILLARS AND CURVED CEILINGS IT HAS SIX MORE ROOMS SOME BUCKINGHAM PALACE IF YOU PLEASE AND IT'S ALSO THE VENUE FOR AN ANNUAL DINNER THAT DATES BACK NOW SIX HUNDRED YEARS
THIS IS A VERY TRADITIONAL DINNER MADE FOR ORGANISING FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
SO I HOPE THAT WHEN THE CHANCELLOR AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF A COMING TOGETHER HERE THIS IS THE SIGN FOR BEING TOGETHER
HAMBURG MARE ALL OF SHORTS IS HOSTING THE DINNER IT'S A VERY PUBLIC DISPLAY ISN'T IT OF BEING SIDE BY SIDE SO CLOSE TO THE SUMMIT SO HOW CONVINCED DO YOU THINK THEY ARE THAT THIS IS A SMOOTH HOME RUN THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT DID A LOT
TO FIND A SOLUTION AND MY EXPERIENCE OF THE POLITICAL OFFENCES THAT IT'S ALWAYS THE CASE THAT THE REAL DEAL IS MADE AT THE LAST SECOND WE WAIT THURSDAY NIGHT WE HAVE TO
BUT GERMANY IS NOT KNOWN FOR BEING A LAIDBACK NATION WITH THE CASE SIRAH SIRAH PHILOSOPHY SO ANXIOUS WAS THE MERKEL GOVERNMENT TO GIVE DAVID CAMERON A HELPING HAND WITH THIS E. YOU WE NEGOTIATIONS THAT HE'D FORMED A TROUBLE SHOOTING BRECHT'S AT TASK FORCE OF ITS OWN DE IS HAMBURG'S FORMER DEPUTY MAYOR AND HE'S A NATIONAL BOARD MEMBER OF ANGELA MERKEL SEE DO YOU PARTY
YOU WANT IT IS ENGLAND AND BE SEEN WHAT OUR FATTO FROST GERMANS BRITAIN IS LIKE A MOTHER OR A FATHER OF EUROPE WE CAN'T IMAGINE THEM LEAVING THE FAMILY DIFFERENT WE LOOK AT THE PAST ALL THAT PAIN AND BLOODSHED OF WORLD WARS BEFORE ARRIVING AT EUROPEAN UNION WE LOOK AT THE FUTURE WE IN EUROPE ONLY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION WE CAN'T ACT ALONE WE NEED TO STAND TOGETHER
AND ANYWAY GERMANY ALSO AGREES WITH MISTER CAMERON'S EMU REFORMERS LIKE CHANGING MIGRANT BENEFITS WE ALSO HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE COMING OUR WAY BECAUSE OF A GENEROUS WELFARE SYSTEM
BUT THE ISSUE OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE COMING GERMANY'S WAY MOST OF THEM ON CROWDED DENISE FROM TURKEY VIA GREECE HAS ALSO DISTRACTED CHANCELLOR MERKEL FROM THE BRITISH QUESTION AND IT'S WEAKENED HER HAND AT HOME AND ABROAD JUST HOURS BEFORE DAVID CAMERON ARRIVES IN HAMBURG WE CAME ACROSS THIS
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ON THE STREET HERE YOUNG FAMILIES MIDDLE CLASS COUPLES PENSIONERS ALL DEMONSTRATING AGAINST PLANS TO BUILD NEW HOUSING FOR THOUSANDS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS AND SHOP DENIABLE
FOR HOW TO FRIGHTEN US POLITICIANS CURRENT LISTENING TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE MISSUS MERKEL IS NOT LIMITING MIGRANT NUMBERS DIVISIONS ARE DEEP IN GERMANY
DIVISION TO SPREADING ACROSS EUROPE TEAM FURTHER REDUCING GERMAN INFLUENCE SO ALL PERVASIVE AND PERSUASIVE EVEN SIX MONTHS AGO
SAINT JOSEPH'S CHURCH THIS ASH WEDNESDAY IN CENTRAL HAMBURG OR SERVICE IN POLAND
GERMANY IS HOME TO MORE THAN TWO MILLION POLES THAT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NUMBER LIVING IN THE U.K. BUT TRADITIONALLY STRONG TIES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES HAD BECOME STRAINED FOLLOWING THE VICTORY OF CENTRE RIGHT NATIONALISTS IN POLAND'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS
MARCUS COT SO HE'S A PROFESSOR OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS AT HAMBURG UNIVERSITY SINCE THE ELECTION I THINK QUITE A LOT OF THINGS CHANGE THE NEW GOVERNMENT IS MUCH MORE HARSH END
WAIT A MINUTE I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT ITS ENTIRE GERMAN THAT MIGHT OVER GOOD THING IT'S ALSO NOT WANTING TO BE VAST OF OLD BY BIG GERMANY HOLLAND ONCE TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A POLITICAL PLAY
PLAIN AND HOLLAND OF COURSE IT'S GOT ANALYSED THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT IN HUNGARY FOR INSTANCE OTHER COUNTRIES
I THINK IT'S LIKE TOGETHER IS A BLOCKED UNABLE MILDLY ABSOLUTELY
WHAT COULD MAKE SURE AIMS FOR BRITAIN ABSOLUTELY THAT COULD CAUSE TROUBLE FOR BRITAIN I THINK GERMANY SHOULD NOT BE OVERESTIMATED
SO IT'S A PRIME MINISTER I CAN'T COUNT ON GERMANY TO BULLDOZE LAST MINUTE OBJECTIONS TO HIS E.U. DEAL THAT NEXT WEEK SUMMIT SHOULD HAMBURG'S ANGLER FILES PREPARE FOR BYE BYE BRITAIN AS ONE POPULAR NEWSPAPER WROTE HERE
HERE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAMBURG PLAYERS BASIC RUPERT WOMB UP VOCALLY WELL IN THE FOYER WE GET THEIR BRITISH GERMAN AUDIENCE INTO THE ANALYTICAL SWING OF THINGS AFTER ALL THIS WEEK'S PERFORMANCE IS ENTITLED LOVE POLITICS AND DIRTY LAUNDRY
BASICALLY THE GERMANS ARE FAIRLY PRO BRITISH IF YOU LIKE ALTHOUGH THE TROUBLE IS THAT THERE ARE ALSO
WOULD SAY WELL IF THE BRITS DON'T WANT TO STAY THEN GOOD RIDDANCE
I THINK EVERY GERMAN THINGS THAT BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT ANGULAR AMERICAN AND DAVID CAMERON
TO TALK ABOUT IT I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE ANNOYED AND THEY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE HE REMEMBERS WITH
MORE PRIVILEGES YOU CALL EXTRA WORDS LIKE EXTRA SAUSAGE EXTRA THAT YOU WOULD GIVE BRITAIN EXCELLENT GOEST AND ENCOURAGE IT TO KEEP THE ESTONIAN
THE PRIME MINISTER'S Y. YOU DEAL ORDEAL IS NOT OVER YET AND YES THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF THEATRE TO THE INSISTENCE THAT NEGOTIATIONS REMAINED FRAUGHT TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
BUT BUT GERMANY TOO WEAK TO FORCE UNANIMOUS YOU NEED A SUPPORT THERE IS A REAL RISK HERE OF CURTAINS CLOSING WITH AN UNEXPECTED TWIST

AND THEN I GOT VERY VERY MUCH BETTER AS I GOT OLDER I REALISED I COULD TAKE RISKS IN THE WORLD WOULDN'T FALL APART MY CASTAWAY PROFESSOR DAME CAROL BLACK DO JOIN US TO HEAR HER DESERT ISLAND DISCS THIS MORNING AT NINE
THE WEATHER SNOW ACROSS NORTHERN SCOTLAND EVERYWHERE ELSE VARIABLE CLOUD AND SOME SHOWERS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR JOHN HUMPHRYS AND JUSTIN WEBB THE TIME TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE AND KRYSTLE RIDGES HERE WITH A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS DIPLOMATS THAT SYRIAN PEACE TALKS IN MUNICH HAVE AGREED TO SEEK A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES THROUGHOUT SYRIA WITHIN A WEEK
I KNOW SIR FRONT WOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THIS TRUCE A DECISION WAS ALSO MADE TO DELIVER HUMANITARIAN AID TO BESIEGED AREAS THE FORMER BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO SYRIA PETER FORD TOLD US HE DOUBTED THE OPPOSITION WOULD ACHIEVE A CEASEFIRE
SOME N.H.S. CHIEF EXECUTIVES HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT THEY HAD BACKED THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW CONTRACT FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND BUT NOT THE MOVE TO IMPOSE IT ON THEM THEIR SIGNATURES WERE CITED BY THE HEALTH SECRETARY HAS HE JUSTIFIED HIS DECISION
ROLLS ROYCE HAS REPORTED A TWELVE PER CENT DROP IN ITS PROFITS BEFORE WAS LESS THAN EXPECTED BUT THE ENGINE MAKE A STILL HALVED ITS DIVIDEND THE COMPANY HAS SUFFERED A DROP IN ORDERS FROM THE OIL LAND DEFENCE INDUSTRIES
A NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN FINED A TOTAL OF FORTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS FOR ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY SAY GLAXOSMITHKLINE HAD PAID RIVAL COMPANIES TO DELAY THE INTRODUCTION OF CHEAPER GENERIC VERSIONS OF ONE OF ITS DRUGS
THANK YOU TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO PAY A WOMAN LESS THAN A MAN FOR THE SAME JOB THAT HE'S ON EQUAL PAY BUT OF COURSE LIFE IS MORE COMPLICATED THAT THAT AND THE GENDER PAY GAP AT THE PRIME MINISTER'S PROMISE TO END IN A GENERATION IS STILL A STUBBORN THING AND A DIFFERENT THING WE'RE BEING TOLD TODAY THAT MORE PRESSURE IS GOING TO BE PUT ON LARGE COMPANIES TO TELL US ABOUT THEIR PAY GAPS I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY HELEN AWAY
WHO IS A SENIOR PATENT EXAMINER AND TINA KNIGHT WHO IS CHAIR OF WOMEN INTO BUSINESS MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING ELLA WAIT IF I COULD START WITH YOU YOU TOOK A COMPANY TO A TRIBUNAL DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE AND WHERE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT
UNEQUAL PAY OR WERE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT A VEGA PAID
O.K. WELL WE KNEW THAT IN THEIR PARTICULAR ROLE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THERE WERE PAY GAPS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WHICH COULDN'T BE JUSTIFIED BY EXPERIENCE OF UP TO AROUND EIGHT THOUSAND AND THAT WAS ALMOST TWENTY PER CENT OF WHAT PEOPLE WERE EARNING OUR EMPLOYER DID AN EQUAL PAY OR DEBT WHICH SHOWED US THAT THIS WAS SYSTEMATICALLY DISADVANTAGE IN WOMEN
NOW SIX OF US WANTED TO CHALLENGE THAT AND OUR TRADE UNION PROSPECT SUPPORTED US IN BRINGING EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL CLAIMS AND ULTIMATELY IN REACHING AN AGREED SETTLEMENT WITH OUR EMPLOYER AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR PEOPLE IN TERMS OF EXTRA MONEY
OH THAT RESULTED IN INCREASES OF UP TO EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MEMBERS OF STAFF AND LANGUAGE MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN WHICH CLOSES THE GAP BETWEEN THE LOWEST AND HIGHEST PAID IN THE VAN AND THEREFORE ERADICATED THE GENDER PAY DIFFERENCE AND IF IT'S COMPLICATED BUT THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE UNEQUAL PAY WHICH IS POTENTIALLY AGAINST THE LAW RATHER THAN A SORT OF VAGUE AGENDA PAY GAP WHERE I DON'T KNOW WOMAN TAKES CAREER BREAKS AND SO IS DOING OR HE'S DOING A JOB THAT IS SIMPLY LESS WELL PAID THAN ANOTHER JOB WITHIN A COMPANY
I THINK THE GENDER PAY GAP IS MADE UP OF A RANGE OF DIFFERENT THINGS AT ALL BUILD UP TO MAKE A BIGGER GAP BETWEEN WHAT WOMEN OR MEN BUT THE IMPORTANT THING FOR US WAS THAT THE EMPLOYER WAS TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHERE THE GAPS WERE AND WE WERE ABLE TO GO AWAY AND LOOK AT THEM AND WORK OUT WHETHER THERE WAS SOMETHING WE COULD DO ABOUT IT
POINT TINA KNIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE ISN'T IT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO BE SUGGESTING TODAY IS THAT THE MORE TRANSPARENCY THERE IS THEN THE MORE THESE UNFAIRNESS AS WILL WITHER AWAY
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY BUT IN REAL LIFE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY APPLY WHY NOT WELL BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT IS
IN THIS SORT OF HORSES FOR COURSES AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SORT OUT WHAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE DOING EXACTLY THE SAME JOB IN APPLE FOR APPLE ALSO A VERY DIFFERENT IF TWO PEOPLE ARE PAID THE SAME BUT WORK AT A DIFFERENT PACE PERFORMANCE RELATED IS ALWAYS THE MOST PRODUCT DIFFERENT THE WAY FOR A COMPANY TO OPERATE BUT IF THAT'S A SORRY IF PEOPLE ARE DOING A JOB AT A DIFFERENT PACE BECAUSE COS YOU PUT IT
THEN BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT ALL THE MEN ARE BEING PAID AS IF THEY'RE AT A HIGH PACE AND WOMEN BEING PAID AS IF THEY'RE LOW PACE THEN YOU CAN SEE CAN'T YOU THAT THERE IS A BIT ANGELA YOU CAN AT LEAST INVESTIGATE WHETHER THAT'S ON FIRE YES BUT THAT DOESN'T SHOW IN A TICK BOX BASICALLY THIS IS YET ANOTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT INTERFERING IN BUSINESS INSTEAD OF GOVERNING AND DICTATING IT'S THIS MAY GO FOR THESE NEEDS
TICK BOX FLOAT WINNING REACTION WITHOUT REALISING THE FULL IMPLICATION WHAT DRUGS DO YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT IF SOMEBODY IS LOOKING FOR A JOB THEY ARE GOING TO SERIOUSLY STUDY COMPANIES TICK BOX LISTS OF WHAT THEY DO WELL THEY MIGHT HANG ON THE SET THEY MIGHT LOOK A WOMAN MIGHT LOOK AT A COMPANY UNDER DO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EVEN THINKING OF WORKING THERE MIGHT LOOK AT A COMPANY THINK LESS OF IT
IF IT EMPLOYS A VERY OBVIOUS PRACTICE OF PAYING WOMEN LESS THAN THAT PIECE OFF NOT ON OFFICE PRACTICE MEAN THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT ONLY NINE POINT FOUR PERCENT
OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT ON EQUAL PAY THAT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING AND QUITE HONESTLY IT'S OFTEN AS I SAY VERY DIFFICULT TO UM SEND THE TOTALLING IN THAT THEY ARE PUTTING FORWARD IS NINETEEN PERCENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT OTHER TEN PER CENT OF PEOPLE THERE I'M FLEXIBLE AND PART TIME WORK BUT HE'S A BIT UNDERWEIGHT COMPANY THAT THEY
WE JUST SORT OF SAY OIL MOVE ON THEY CAN CARRY ON DOING THAT IF THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THEY COULD BUT MOST COMPANIES OFFER EQUAL PAY FOR DOING EXACTLY THE SAME JOB IT'S SHOWN IN THE STATISTICS
LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT IT STAFF ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF A COMPANY WE'RE NOT IN THE DAYS OF THE TOLPUDDLE MARTYRS COMPANIES KNOW THAT WITHOUT LOOKING AFTER THEIR STAFF TREATING THEM FAIRLY AND EQUALLY THEY WILL NOT GET THE PRODUCTION THEY NEED FOR A GOOD WORKFORCE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT AND THE WAY I DO IT IF WE LEAVE IT TO COMPANIES EVENTUALLY INCLUDING THE COMPANY THAT YOU TOOK TO THAT TRIBE YOUR LEG THERE THEY COME ROUND TO THE IDEA THAT YOU'VE GOT TO TREAT PEOPLE
I THINK FOR ME THE OTHER KEY ASPECT WHY WE WERE ABLE TO SUCCEED AS WELL AS ACCESS THE INFORMATION WAS SUPPORT FROM A UNION SO I UNION WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT US IN INVESTIGATING WHAT THE CAUSES OF THE GAP WERE PROVIDING US WITH EXPERTISE IN THE RESOURCE TO DO THIS I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE SIX OF US COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS ALONE
YOU JUST STATED THAT THE COMPANY WERE VERY TRANSPARENT AND THAT'S WHAT MADE IT EQUAL THE EASY FOR YOU TO FIND SO THE COMPANY WAS BEING TRANSPARENT POSSIBLY THERE WAS ANOMALY THAT THEY WEREN'T AWARE OF BUT THE VERY FACT THAT YOU STATED YOURSELF THAT THEY WERE VERY TRANSPARENT WHICH MADE IT EASY TO LOOK AT
I DON'T KNOW SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OTHER COMPANIES EQUALLY TRANSPARENT YES BUT THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT IF IT'S NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM I THINK IN THE INDUSTRY THEY'RE GOOD FOR IS ONLY NINE POINT FOUR PERCENT WE HAVE GONE ON IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS AND ME TALKING NOW IN THE SAME BREATH THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FIFTY YEARS TO MAKE UP THE EQUALITY NO IT'S NOT BECAUSE IN FIFTY YEARS' TIME WITH THE CURRENT INTAKE OF
LEGAL THAN MEDICAL ACCOUNTING PROFESSIONS WITH OVER SIXTY PER CENT INPUT TAKEN WOMEN IT'S GOING TO BE A MINISTER FOR MEN FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY FOR ONE THING IDEA ISN'T IT ELLEN AWAY THAT ACTUALLY AND BECAUSE OF YOU THINK OF WOMEN DOING VERY WELL ON THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT UNIVERSITY NOW AND THEY ARE THE OLD IDEA THAT WOMEN ARE SOMEHOW DOING JOBS THAT REQUIRE FEWER QUALIFICATIONS YOU GET LESS MONEY ACTUALLY THAT REALLY IS GOING TO WITHER AWAY PRETTY QUICKLY
I THINK THAT THE THE TRANSPARENCY BUT THIS IS BRINGING IN AS A REALLY GOOD FIRST STEP I THINK IF WE HAD BEEN IN THE POSITION WHERE WE WERE JUST SITTING THERE LOOKING AT OUR OWN SALARIES AND LOOKING AT THE SPAN WE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A DISPARITY BUT WE WOULDN'T HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SYSTEMATICALLY DISADVANTAGE IN WOMEN I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY YOU DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION THE QUESTION WAS COMPANIES ACTUALLY
ARE MAKING MOVES AND IT WILL EQUAL OUT IT'S SIXTY PERCENT AND ALSO WOMEN ARE BETTER EDUCATED AND ANNA DOING BETTER OUT OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT WAS POINTING AND FURRY FACT THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF JUNIOR MANAGERS ARE NOW WOMEN AND FORTY PER CENT MIDDLE MANAGEMENT AND TWENTY PER CENT SENIOR YOU GO BACK TWENTY YEARS IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT COMPANIES ARE PROGRESSING
WOMEN ARE PROGRESSING AND COMPANIES AS THEY SAY REALISE THEY HAVE GOT TO LOOK AFTER THEIR STAFF AND THEY WILL SORT IT OUT THEMSELVES YOU DO NOT NEED INTERFERENCE FROM GOVERNMENT FROM RUNNING BUSINESSES ELEVATE US WERE THEN SHARING THAT DATA SHOULD BE A GOOD POSITIVE STEP FOR EMPLOYERS WHO WERE IN THAT POSITION I THINK ELLA WADE ANTENNA NIGHT AS WELL THANK YOU
IT IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE BRITAIN'S BIGGEST DRUGS COMPANY GLAXOSMITHKLINE HAS BEEN FINED NEARLY FORTY MILLION POUNDS FOR ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR PAYING COMPETITORS TO DELAY BRINGING IN GENERIC DRUGS WHICH WOULD COMPETE WITH THEIR OWN MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE DRUGS
WELL IF THE FIND HAS BEEN LEVIED BY THE COMPETITION MARKETS AUTHORITY THEY TOOK OVER FROM THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING AND APRIL AND THEIR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ENFORCEMENT IS MICHAEL RENTAL GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOW WHEN I SAY PAYING COMPETITORS TO DELAY BRINGING IN DRUGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BRIBING THEM AREN'T WE
WELL THOSE ARE YOUR WORDS THIS IS A SERIOUS WOULDN'T AGREE WITH THAT THE TWO OF THEM THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ANTI DEPRESSANT DRUGS THAT'S USED TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MARKET THAT AT THE TIME THIS WAS GOING ON WAS WORTH ROUGHLY NINETY MILLION
AND WHAT GLAXOSMITHKLINE DID WARS THAT IT PAINT AND NUMBER OF GENERIC COMPANIES AS YOU SAID TO DELAY COMPETING AGAINST THEM HEAD ON IN THE MARKET PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS A COMPANY PRODUCES A NEW DRUG FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME IT'S IT'S ALLOWED TO SELL THAT DRUG WITHOUT ANY COMPETITION WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY IT'S PAID A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY OFFERED TO DEVELOP THAT DRUG
AND THEN EVENTUALLY OTHER COMPANIES COME ALONG AND PRODUCE COPIES OF THE DRUG TO THE BETTER WORD GENERIC DRUGS IN OTHER WORDS AND THEY CAN SELL THEIR MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE CHEAPLY THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND IN THIS CASE THERE'S A GENERIC COMPANIES ORIGINALLY CHALLENGED THE PACKINGTON SAID THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO ENTER AND THE WAY THEY RESOLVED THIS WAS
GLAXOSMITHKLINE PAID THEM TO DELAY INDEPENDENT ENTRY IN COMPETITION WITH THEM AND THE EFFECT OF RESTRICTING COMPETITION IN THAT WAY IS USUALLY TO MAKE PRICE IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN AND WE KNOW IN THIS CASE THAT WHEN GENERIC COMPETITORS EVENTUALLY DID ENTER THE MARKET
THE PRICE FELL WITHIN TWO YEARS BY OVER SEVENTY PERCENT AND THAT'S REAL MONEY THAT'S PAID FOR BY THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE AND ULTIMATELY BY ALL OF US AS TAX JUST CASING EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE THEY HAVE ACTUALLY SAVED MILLIONS OF POUNDS THE N.H.S. MILLIONS OF POUNDS BY THE WAY THEY HAVE THERE BEEN CONDUCTING THEMSELVES I THINK THAT'S A RED HERRING AT WATCH S. KATIE IT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WAS ALLOWED
AS THOSE GENERIC COMPETITORS TO UM TO SUPPLY SOME DRUGS BUT NOT INDEPENDENTLY OF G.S.K. FOR EXAMPLE JUST AS THEIR DISTRIBUTORS IN FULL COMPETITION WITH THEM IN FACT THEY EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FULL COMPETITION WITH THEM THEY ARE APPEALING AREN'T THEY THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAL
WE HAVE HEARD ALL THE ARGUMENTS WE'VE LOOKED AT ALL THE FACTS AND TAKEN ALL THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WE THINK THIS IS FAIR AND ROBUST DECISION IS A VERY VERY SERIOUS MATTER AND WE WANT TO SEND A SIGNAL NOT JUST AS PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY BUT ACROSS
ACROSS THE ECONOMY THAT WE WON'T TOLERATE THESE KIND OF PRACTICES THAT RESTRICT COMPETITION THAT HARM CUSTOMERS AND IN THIS CASE HARM TAX IF IT'S THAT SERIOUS WHY ISN'T A BIGGER FINE AME FORTY MILLION MIGHT BE A LOT TO YOU OR ME BUT NOT TO A HUGE DRUGS COMPANY WELL I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY WOULD SAY THAT WE'VE CALCULATED WHAT WE THINK IS THE RIGHT FINE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE FACTORS THAT WE NORMALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SIZE OF THE COMPANY THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE INFRINGEMENT WE THINK IT'S A RIGHT AND A FAIR FINE
AND IT SENDS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT SIGNAL THAT THIS KIND OF ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR THAT HARMS CUSTOMERS HARMS TAXPAYERS IN THIS CASE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED BY THE C.M.E. MICHAEL RENTAL THANKS A LOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH A TIME SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE ANOTHER DAY OF TURMOIL ON THE WORLD'S STOCK MARKETS YESTERDAY BIG FALLS INVESTORS HEADING FOR SAFETY AND PLENTY OF DARK TALK ABOUT HOW UNPREPARED WE ARE
FOR ANOTHER CRASH THE PRINCIPLE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE TROUBLES THIS TIME ROUND
IT'S FAIR TO SAY PROBABLY IS CHINA THE GREAT ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE WHOSE ECONOMY IS THIS GOING TO HAVE TO TRANSFORM NOUN ALSO FACE SLOWER GROWTH BUT THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS TO THE RED OF THE CENTRAL BANKS HAS BEEN VERY MUCH DISCUSSED IN THE PAPERS THIS MORNING SO WHAT NEXT FOR CHINA FOR THE CENTRAL BANKS INDEED FOR ALL OF US PANIC A BUYER'S HERE FORMER BANK OF ENGLAND ECONOMIST AND SO'S GEORGE MAGNUS ASSOCIATE AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY'S CHINA CENTRE AND SENIOR ECONOMIC AND BUYS YOU U.B.S. THE INVESTMENT BY MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING AND CAN WE START OFF WITH
CHINA DANAE AND HER DID IT HAVE HAS THERE BEEN ANY MARKET OVER REACTION TO WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WAS REPORTED TO BE THE STATE OF THE CHINESE A COMP
YOU'VE BEEN A VERY DELAYED REACTION I'VE BEEN ON THE SHOWS AS I WAS ONCE A BANK OF CONNORS I CAN'T DENY THAT BUT I AM NOW DIRECTOR OF FATHOM CONSULTING AND HAVE BEEN FOR OVER A DECADE
I'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW FOR YEARS ARGUMENT CHINA WILL HAVE INEVITABLY WILL HAVE A HARD LANDING BECAUSE IT'S MADE EXACT THE SAME MISTAKES AS WE MADE THE AMERICANS MADE THE JAPANESE BEFORE ALL OF US LENT TOO MUCH MONEY AGAINST AN ASSET THAT FALLEN IN VALUE
AND A LETTER THAT IS THIS THE HEARTLAND YES I BELIEVE WHEN CHINESE I THINK IS STRANGE AND IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY THE WAY THAT YOU FRASER QUESTION BUT THAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON AND MARKETS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE TRYING TO SLOW DOWN AS IF IT'S EITHER A NEW THING OR IT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TRYING TO HAS SLOWED IT HAS SLOWED DRAMATICALLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN
I DON'T THINK THAT'S IN DISPUTE EVEN THE OFFICIAL DATA SHOW THAT WHETHER YOU DISPUTE THE OFFICIAL G.P. DATE AS WE DO THEY STILL SHOW A MARK SLOWING IN GROVE TO DECADE LOWS IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL SO IS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS REACTION TO THAT A REASONABLE REACTION TO WHAT THEY ARE SAYING OR IS IT NOT NO I THINK IT'S UNREASONABLE FOR TWO REASONS ONE IT'S VERY DELAYED US SAID THAT THE SLOW DOWN HAS ALREADY HAPPENED AND YOU BARELY NOTICED THAT AS FAR AS GLOBAL GROWTH IS CONCERNED
BUT THE SECOND REASON IS THAT THEY SEEM TO BE MISUNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF CHINA HAS PLAYED IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WHEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AMERICA SLOW DOWN IT MATTERED AMERICA'S THE WORLD'S LARGEST ECONOMY AND IT DEMANDS MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE AND AS WELL AS ITS FINANCIAL INTEREST IS CHINA'S ANNETTE SUPPLIER SO I'M OF AN AGE WEREN'T TIME USED WE CALLED JAPAN JAPAN WAS EXCEPTIONAL
IF YOU'D HAVE TOLD PEOPLE IN NINETEEN NINETY THAT THE ECONOMY HAD GROWN FATTER THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY THERE'S OUR PERFORMED EVERYONE ELSE WHOSE BANKS ARE TAKEN OVER THE WHOLE WORLD SUPPOSE SUPPOSE BECOMING THE WORLD LARGE ECONOMY ANY MINUTE NOW WILL THIS YEAR HIT ZERO GROWTH ZERO INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES
AND WILL STILL BE HERE IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS' TIME AND YOU WILL BARELY NOTICE IT I MEET THEM WITHIN A SILO THAT RAISES THE BUT IT'S ALL TRUE BECAUSE JAPAN JUST LIKE CHINA WAS A NET SUPPLIER YES
A BETTER BUT IS CHINA DIFFERENT GEORGE MAGNUS IN ONE REALLY IMPORTANT RESPECT WHICH IS THAT THE CHINESE ECONOMY IS STILL VERY MUCH CONTROLLED FROM THE CENTRE AND THAT THEY CAN IN A SENSE DO THINGS ACHIEVED THINGS THAT OTHER ECONOMIES CANNOT INCLUDING PROTECTING THEMSELVES FROM THE WORST OF
THIS WEATHER IT'S A SLOWDOWN ORO HARD LANDING OR WHATEVER IT YES I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT BECAUSE IT IS A STATE CONTROL SYSTEM AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY ACTUALLY HAS A RHYTHM WHICH IS TO BE EMPOWERED TO REMAIN IN CONTROL AND SO THERE IS A KIND OF A TYPICAL KIND OF WESTERN REACTION IF I MAY SAY SO I'M A WEST SPOOK WHICH IS
THEY HAVE THEIR PROBLEMS WHICH DANNY IS JUST KIND OF OUTLINED AND THEREFORE WE THINK THAT IT MUST UNFOLDING IT MUST EVOLVE IN A CERTAIN WAY WITH WHICH WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY APPLIES A CLASSIC EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE AT THE MOMENT AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF KIND OF EXPECTATION AROUND THAT THE CHINESE WILL HAVE TO BE FORCED TO DEVALUE THEIR EXCHANGE RATES BECAUSE THEY'RE BLEEDING RESERVES AND SORT OF CAPITAL FLIGHT GOING OUT BECAUSE CHINESE COMPANIES AND CHINESE RESIDENTS ARE FINDING WAYS OF GETTING THEIR MONEY OUT OF CHINA COS THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON
BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY IN MY VIEW THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY APPLY THE PRIME INSTINCT OF THE PARTY IS TO BE IN CONTROL I THINK THEY WILL BASICALLY CLAMPDOWN IF NECESSARY WITH BACKED UP BY INCARCERATION AND PUNISHMENT IN IMPLEMENTING CONTROLS DO YOU AGREE DAD I'M AFRAID I DON'T I AGREED TO STAY IN THE TURN IS A CONTROLLED ECONOMY BUT THAT'S A MAJOR MAJOR DISADVANTAGE
I MAY HAVE BEEN ASLEEP AT THE POINT TO WHICH CONTROL ECONOMIES WERE PROVED TO BE BETTER ABLE TO MANAGE THE ECONOMY CAPITALISTS SO THEM QUITE WELL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME SO TO JAPAN AND WE WERE TOLD THE SAME THING ABOUT JAPAN JAPAN COULDN'T HAVE A CRASH BECAUSE THEY WERE IN CONTROL DIFFERENT RUSSIA DO QUITE WELL FOR HER WELL FOR A WHILE UNTIL IT DIDN'T
WHAT CHINA'S GOING THROUGH IS A VERY CAPITALIST PROBLEM TOUCHED IT AND THEY'LL HAVE TO RESOLVE IT CAN I MOVE YOU BOTH ONTO THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE JUST JUST FINALLY AND RELATIVELY BRIEFLY GEORGE MAGNUS IS IT DIM IN A LOT OF THE PAPERS ARE SAYING THE REAL FAULT HERE IS A CENTRAL BANKS AND IT'S PARTICULARLY THIS BUSINESS OF NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES HE HAD NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES COS THE BANKS THE PRIVATE BANKS MONEY THEN TO DEPOSIT MONEY WHICH THEY HAVE TO DO AND ACTUALLY YOU DO YOU SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE FOOT YEAH I I REALLY DO THINK THAT ACTUALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CHINA AS BEING THE SORT OF
THE BET MWAH FOR ALL THAT AILS GLOBAL MARKETS I TALKED ABOUT IT YOU KNOW MARK CARNEY STOCKED PUBLISHED I THINK ACTUALLY THEY'RE CHASING SHADOWS HERE CHINA'S IMPORTANT IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT AS IT'S GOING TO BE I THINK IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS BUT THIS IS NOT REALLY THE BIG ISSUE THE BIG ISSUE AS WE THERE IS A BIT OF A MALAYS GOING ON IN OUR ECONOMIES AND CENTRAL BANKS HAVE CREATED PARTICULARLY NOW WE SEE THE BANKING SECTOR IMPLODING THIS WEEK
CENTRAL BANKS I THINK ARE INDULGED IN A SORT OF AN EXPERIMENT WHICH I THINK IS MORE LIKE FRANKENSTEIN'S LABORATORY ACTUALLY THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW ACTUALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES THEY'RE BASICALLY DESTROYING THE BUSINESS MODEL OF BANKS WE KNOW NOBODY WANTS TO BE NICE TO BANKS RIGHT BUT I MEAN BANKS HAVE TO EARN MONEY IN ORDER TO BUILD UP THEIR CAPITAL AND BE SAFE AND THIS NEGATIVE RATES AS DESTROYING DANNY AGREE
GLUE THAT THAT LAST POINT I THINK THE IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT CHINA IT'S NOT DIVORCED FROM A GLOBAL CRISIS IS PART OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS CHINA WAS THE COUNTRY THE LENT THE MONEY THAT CREATED THE GLOBAL IMBALANCES THAT LED TO THE CRISIS THIS IS JUST THE LAST SHOE TO DROP
AND WAS ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN YOU ALWAYS DEFAULT ON YOUR CREDITORS THE NATURE OF THINGS TURNED IT WAS THE CREDITOR WELL I'M NOT SURPRISED IT'S GOING THERE WHERE I THINK THE MARKET'S GONE ADDED TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND GOT SIX POINT EIGHT IS THEY SEE CHINA STONE DOWN THERE NOT SURE ANYTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT AND THEY FEEL THAT MONETARY POLICIES RUN OUT OF ROAD
NEGATIVE INTO RATES DESPERATE AND THERE'S NOT MUCH CAN BE DONE DANNY AND GEORGE MAGNUS AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE ED BALLS YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ME HE'S COME OUT TODAY BEHIND THE PRIME MINISTER'S EUROPEAN NEGOTIATIONS YOU'VE WRITTEN OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ARGUE FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. RED BALLS HE SPENT SOME TIME AT HARVARD IN THE UNITED STATES AS BEING THERE TO TALK TO HIM WHAT IS THERE ANYWAY TALKING AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE REALLY UNDERSTANDS THE LEVEL OF SCEPTICISM THE BRITISH PUBLIC HAS TOWARDS THE
THERE'S NO DOUBT THE EURO CRISIS WHICH HAS DRAGGED ON FOR A YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR HAS BEEN
A REAL DISASTER FOR THE BRITISH ARGUMENT TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE WRONGLY YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE LOOKING ACROSS THE CHANNEL AND THINKING MAYBE WE'D BE BETTER OFF GOING IT ALONE AND OVERLAID ON TOP OF THAT YOU'VE HAD THE THE REFUGEE CRISIS IN THE LAST YEAR AND THE WIDER PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC MIGRATION WHICH HAS BEEN HUGELY UNPOPULAR WITH PEOPLE SAYING BUT THEY CAN'T CONTROL IT THEY'VE NOT GOT A GRIP AND I THINK THAT
WE'VE GOT TO SHOW A POPULATION THAT BRITAIN'S INFLUENCE CAN BE USED TO MAKE REAL CHANGES IN EUROPE AND THAT'S WHAT DAVID CAMERON IS TRYING TO DO THROUGH HIS RENEGOTIATION IN THE POINT IS THOUGH WE COULD ONLY MAKE THOSE CHANGES FROM THE INSIDE WE CAN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF OF OF COMPANIES NOT PAYING THEIR TAX
OR EUROPE'S FAILURE TO TACKLE THE REFUGEE CRISIS FROM THE OUTSIDE WE'VE GOT TO DO IS WHEN THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE CAN HAVE INFLUENCE FROM WITHIN
I THINK WE HAD TO WIN THIS REFERENDUM BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE TO DO TO WIN THAT CASE ONE OF THE POINTS YOU MAKE IN THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT BORDER CONTROLS WHICH YOU SAY IS AN ISSUE THAT DISTURBS PEOPLE AND I'LL JUST CAUGHT WOULD YOU SAY HE HAD IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL I BELIEVE THE RESTORATION OF BORDER CONTROLS IN A POSITION OF CONTROLS AND ECONOMIC MIGRATION WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME THE MAINSTREAM VIEW ANOTHER WARDS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE FOR
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT POLITICS IN FRANCE AND IN GERMANY IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK YOU SEE ECHOES OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN BRITAIN PEOPLE FEELING THAT THINGS AREN'T IN CONTROL THAT POLITICIANS AREN'T RISING TO THE CHALLENGE AND THE REALITY IS THAT WITHOUT THE REFUGEE CRISIS
MAYBE YOU COULD SUSTAIN THE SHOWING IMPORT OF EUROPE BUT A TIME WHEN THINGS YOU FEEL OUT OF CONTROL IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE YOU CAN CARRY ON WITHOUT PROPER BORDERS
BUT THERE'S A DEEPER POINT WHICH IS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS DRAWN UP IN AN ERA WHERE PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY'D BE TRADING GOODS AND THE MOOD OF CAPITAL BUT THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE ON THIS SCALE WAS NOT EXPECTED IT'S UNPRECEDENTED AND I DON'T THINK IN THE END WE CAN PERSUADE POPULATIONS YOU CAN MANAGE AN OPEN ECONOMY AND MANAGED MIGRATION FAIRLY UNLESS YOU MANAGE IT AT THE MOMENT IT FEELS I MANAGED I THINK DAVID CAMERON WAS RIGHT TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT
THAT WE NEEDED TO MOVE AWAY FROM FREE MOVEMENT I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO WIN THAT ARGUMENT WITH THE OTHER LEADERS IN THERE TO SUPPORT IT I DO I SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT HE'S BEEN MAKING AND THAT WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM FREE MOVEMENT AT THE MOMENT HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO SECURE
RESTRICTIONS ON BENEFITS MIGHT PAY TO MIGRANTS I THINK IN THE END WE WILL END UP WITH MOVING AWAY FROM FROM FREE MOVEMENT AND NATIONAL CONTROL
ON THE AMOUNT OF ECONOMIC MIGRATION BUT I DON'T THINK WHAT HAPPENED QUICKLY ENOUGH FOR THE REFERENDUM BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO IS SAY TO PEOPLE LET'S STAY IN AND WIN THAT ARGUMENT OVER TIME IT WAS ED BALLS TALKING TO JIM AT HARBOUR THE TIME FIVE TO NINE PHYSICISTS THE WORLD OVER ARE UNITED THE DISCOVERY AT LAST OF GRAVITY WAVES IN SPACE IS ONE OF THE TRULY GREAT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES OF OUR AGE HE TOOK A LONG TIME EINSTEIN DEVELOPED THE THEORY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND OF COURSE SO MUCH OF PHYSICS IS THEORY AND DIVA OF ALL UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS DEVOTED
THE THEORETICAL PHYSICS AND NOBEL PRIZES ARE AWARDED IN ALL THE REST OF IT BUT PROOF REAL PROOF IS A RARER COMMODITY I'M JOINED BY FAY JOKER WHO'S THE PROFESSOR IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON GOOD MORNING DID YOU RUNNING OTHER LOTS OF THEORIES OUT THERE WAITING TO BE PROVED WE HAVE MANY
MANY IDEAS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS WHICH INDEED HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION BUT THEY'RE ALSO IDEAS SUCH AS GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WHICH
THE CONSENSUS IS THAT THEY ARE REALLY THERE BUT THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT TO ACT AND HOW OFTEN DOES IT HAPPEN THAT THIS THIS HAPPENED WITH A NEW PIECE OF KIT DIDN'T IT VERY VERY QUICKLY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE FIRST TIME THE NEW PIECE OF KIT WAS PUT TO USE THAT IN FACT THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN
RUNNING FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS SO IN FACT I THINK MY SCIENTIFIC CAREER IS BASICALLY BEN RUT HAS BEEN
IN RUNNING COINCIDENTALLY WITH IT'S A MEAL IS A VERY EMOTIONAL MOMENT YESTERDAY WHEN I DON'T KNOW THE ANNOUNCEMENT I HAVE TO SAY I YEAH I TIPPED OUR TEAR CAME TO MY EYES WHAT IT WAS VERY MOVING AND WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR NOW THEN WHAT'S THE NEXT DEATH BUT BRING THE PROVING THE THEORY GAME I THINK THAT JEN RELATIVITY IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT'S THE CONSENSUS AND
THEY'RE LIKE A RESULTS WHICH SHOWS THAT GRAVITATIONAL WAYS FROM COLLIDING BLACK HOLES CAN BE DETECTED THAT'S THERE
ALMOST THE MOST POWERFUL VERIFICATION OF THAT SERIES THAT ONE CAN IMAGINE IT BRINGS TOGETHER BOTH GRAVITATIONAL WAVES AND BLACK HOLES WHICH WERE THE MOST SPECTACULAR PREDICTIONS OF JEN RELATIVITY IN ONE ACT ONE BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENT SO WE'RE STILL BUZZING ABOUT THAT RIGHT SO I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT IN PEOPLE'S MINDS ANY MORE THAT GENERAL ZIPPITY IS THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE WORLD BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PREDICTIONS THAT IT MAKES THAT WE STILL HAVEN'T
VERIFIED FOR EXAMPLE WE BELIEVE THAT GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WILL BE PRODUCED BY EVENTS IN THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE
JUST AFTER THE BIG BANG AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROPAGATING THROUGH THE UNIVERSE TO US NOW BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T GOT THEIR EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF THAT SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT NOW CAN YOU SATISFY IS THAT THESE THINGS WILL ACTUALLY I CAN SEE WHY YOU WOULD REAP A TIER OF COURSE WHAT AN ENORMOUS ACHIEVEMENT DEVOTED YOUR LIFE TO IT AND ALL THAT BUT SATISFY US THAT THEY WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO OUR LIVES
THESE WONDERFUL DISCOVERIES I CAN ONLY APPEAL TO HISTORY HERE SO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE THAT FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERIES IN SCIENCE HAVE LED TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE BENEFITED US SO IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE I THINK THEY WERE ON THE RADIO RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IN FACT JEN RELATIVITY
CAME OUT OF WAS INSPIRED BY MAXWELL AND FARADAY'S THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION WOMAN HAD THE RADIO OTHERWISE ABSOLUTELY A LOT OF BAD EXAMPLE IN DEVELOPING JEN RELATIVITY THIS THEORY OF GRAVITATION EINSTEIN
WAS HE HE WAS OF THE GENERATION THAT WAS VERY INSPIRED BY UM BY MAXWELL AND FARADAY'S DISCOVERY OF ELECTRIC WAVES THOUGHT ABOUT REALLY BASIC REALLY WE CAN'T HAVE EVER FIND OUR KHAKI WHY HADN'T SOMEBODY FOUND A WAY OF
MAKING THE KHAKI IS NEVER DISAPPEAR A VET'S IN USING PHYSICS WE CAN PREDICT THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS LOSE YOUR CAR KEYS AND THAT IS A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS THE
SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS OH YES YES I KNEW THAT WHICH WHICH SAYS THAT THERE ARE EXPLAINS HOW BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES FOR YOUR CAR KEYS TO BE APART FROM IN YOUR POCKET WHERE THEY SHOULD BE THEY WILL INEVITABLY
GET LOST SO INVERTS WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE KEYS WE CAN JUST PREDICT USING PHYSICS THAT YOU'LL ALWAYS LOSE YOUR KEYS THERE'S NO NEED NO NEED TO WORRY ANSWER THAT'S NOT A TALL HELPFUL BUT THAT THE LESS FOOD LIKE A PROFESSOR THEY DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THAT'S IT KIRSTY YOUNG HERE WITH THEIR DESERT ISLAND DISCS AT NINE I WAS HAS TIMBER FIREMAN JOHN NEAL FROM JOHN COME
