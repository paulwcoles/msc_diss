THEY MAKE HER LIKE THAT ANYWAY DON'T TRANCE IN HOT WATER FOR USING ADELE SONGS WITHOUT HER PERMISSION WE WILL LISTEN TO SOME OF THE OTHER TUNES PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS HAVE WALKED ONTO THE STAGE TO TODAY'S NEWSREADER CHRIS UP
THE FIRST MAJOR CEASEFIRE IN FIVE YEARS OF WAR IN SYRIA APPEARS TO HAVE LARGELY HELD IN THE HOURS SINCE IT CAME INTO FORCE MONITORING GROUPS HAVE REPORTED ONLY ISOLATED GUNFIRE IN ALEPPO SINCE MIDNIGHT LOCAL TIME AND NO ACTIVITY ELSEWHERE INCLUDING AN AIRBASE USED BY RUSSIAN WARPLANES SYRIAN STATE TELEVISION SAYS TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED WHEN A CAR BOMB EXPLODED IN THE PROVINCE OF HAMMER A CORRESPONDENT MARK LOWE IN HIS FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS FROM NEIGHBOURING TURKEY
IT SEEMS TO BE HOLDING AS THE SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES CAME INTO PLACE AT MIDNIGHT THE FIRING STOPPED ACROSS SYRIA A RARE MOMENT OF CALM AFTER FIVE YEARS OF HELL THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP MADE A LINKED A LIST FOR A FRONT AREN'T PART OF THE DEAL SO ATTACKS AGAINST THEM WILL CONTINUE
BUT THE AIM NOW IS TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF TO BESIEGED AREAS AND TO BRING THE DIFFERENT PLAYERS RUSSIA THE WESTERN LED COALITION THE ASAD REGIME AND THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION BACK TO THE TABLE FOR TALKS SCHEDULED FOR THE SEVENTH OF MARCH
IN THE RUN UP TO THE TRUTH THERE WERE HEAVY ATTACKS AROUND DAMASCUS AND ALEPPO BLAMED ON RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES BUT DENIED BY MOSCOW
THE KREMLIN SAYS IT WILL CONTINUE TO HIT TERRORISTS WITH A CEASEFIRE HOLDS WILL DEPEND ON HOW RUSSIA DEFINES THAT GROUP UNTIL NOW IT HAS ALSO USED TO REFER TO THE WESTERN BACKED OPPOSITION
EVEN IF THE CESSATION REMAINS IN PLACE THERE IS STILL NO LONG TERM PLAN FOR HOW TO END THIS WAR AND KEEP SYRIA TOGETHER
THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON HAS CLARIFIED HIS POSITION ON THE IDEA THAT A VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT FORCED BRUSSELS TO GIVE THE U.K. A BETTER DEAL AND TRIGGER A SECOND REFERENDUM MY JOHNSON HE'S BACKING THE CAMPAIGN TO QUIT THE E.U. HAS TOLD THE TIMES THAT OUT HE'S OUT HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON
FOR THOSE ADVOCATING A VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IN JEAN'S REFERENDUM ENTERTAINING THE IDEA THAT SUCH A RESULT COULD ALLOW THE U.K. TO NEGOTIATE FAR BETTER TERMS WITH BRUSSELS HOLDER SECOND REFERENDUM AND STAY IN COMES WITH A BIG POLITICAL ADVANTAGE IT REASSURES PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO VOTE OUT BUT NERVOUS ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF DOING SO A MONDAY BORIS JOHNSON WROTE E.U. HISTORY SHOWS THAT THEY ONLY REALLY LISTEN TO A POPULATION
WHEN IT SAYS NO ACCLAIM WIDELY INTERPRETED AS SUGGESTING HE WOULD THEN ADVOCATES A SECOND REFERENDUM BUT MISTER JOHNSON IS NOW EXPLICIT TELLING THE TIME'S OUT
HE'S OUT AND ADDING WHAT I WANT IS TO GET OUT AND THEN NEGOTIATE A SERIES OF TRADE ARRANGEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD

COUNTING OF THE VOTES CAST IN IRELAND'S GENERAL ELECTION BEGINS THIS MORNING EXIT POLLS SUGGEST THE GOVERNING COALITION WILL FALL SHORT OF A MAJORITY IN THE IRISH PARLIAMENT THE DOYLE FROM DUBLIN CORRESPONDENT JOHNNY DIAMOND REPORTS
SUCH IS THE COMPLEXITY OF IRELAND'S VOTING SYSTEM THAT THE COUNT IS CONDUCTED THE DAY AFTER THE VOTE ITSELF THAT SYSTEM ALSO MAKES PREDICTING THE WINNER PRETTY TRICKY BUT THE LOSERS ARE EASIER TO IDENTIFY LABOUR THE JUNIOR PARTY IN THE COALITION THAT HAS TAKEN IRELAND THROUGH SOME VERY HARD YEARS OF AUSTERITY LOOKS SET TO BE TROUNCED THE GALE THE BIGGEST PARTY IN THE DOLL ALSO LOOKS AS IF IT WILL TAKE A BEATING
SINN FEIN ONCE THE POLITICAL WING OF THE I.R.A. BUT IN THE REPUBLIC A PARTY THAT'S POSITIONED ITSELF ON THE LEFT MAY WELL END UP AS THE THIRD LARGEST PARTY NO MAINSTREAM PARTY WILL ALLY WITH SINN FEIN
THE TWO BIGGEST PARTIES FEENA GALE AND FEEL HER FOUR HAVE BEEN RIVALS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR A COALITION BETWEEN THEM SEEMS UNTHINKABLE WITHOUT ONE FORMING A GOVERNMENT MAYBE IMPOSSIBLE
REPORTS FROM VIETNAM SUGGEST THREE BRITISH TOURISTS WHO DIED AT A WATERFALL YESTERDAY WERE SWEPT OVER THE EDGE BY STRONG CURRENTS THEY GUIDE HAS TOLD A STATE RUN NEWSPAPER THE TRIO WERE SWIMMING WITH LIFEJACKETS NEAR THE POPULAR TOURIST ATTRACTION WHEN THEY WERE CAUGHT UP IN THE SURGING WATERS TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN PAID ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD CHRISTIAN SLOANE AND TO WOMEN NAMED BY FRIENDS AS TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD BETH ANDERSON AND NINETEEN YEAR OLD IZZY SQUIRE

IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE ABOUT A COMPLAINT BY A TEENAGE GIRL THE D.J. INSIST HE WAS NOT
THE B.B.C. DIRECTOR GENERAL LORD HALL SAID HIS EVIDENCE TO THE INQUIRY HAD FALLEN SHORT OF THE STANDARDS EXPECTED MY BLACKBURN STRENUOUSLY DENIES WRONGDOING IN HIS ONLY BROADCAST INTERVIEWS SINCE LEAVING THE CORPORATION HE SAYS THE B.B.C. SACKED HIM AFTER HE REFUSED TO STAND
THEY GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO RESIGN WITH THE SAYING THAT THAT WHERE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY CUT OF ALL TIMES WILL BE B. C. AND WE COULD PROBABLY BRING YOU BACK IN A FEW MONTHS I DON'T THINK PEOPLE KNEW THAT BUT I SAID NO I WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I'VE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE
THE B. B. C. SAID IT WOULD NOT COMMENT FURTHER YOU COULD HEAR THAT INTERVIEW IN FULL ON BROADCASTING HOUSE HERE ON RADIO FOUR FROM NINE A.M. TOMORROW
THE PRODUCER OF JIM'LL FIX IT ROGER AUDACIOUS SAID HE TOLD STAFF ON THE SHOW THAT JIMMY SEVERAL SHOULD NOT BE LEFT ALONE WITH CHILDREN THEN JANET SMITH REVIEW CONCLUDED THAT SENIOR B. B. C. MANAGERS HAD NOT KNOWN OF SERVALS ABUSE MY AUDITION TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT HE'D NOT BELIEVE SEVERAL MIGHT HARM CHILDREN HE'S TOM BATEMAN

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THIS PROGRAMME MY HE SAYS HE DOES REMEMBER TELLING STAFF THAT SAMPLE SHOULD NOT BE LEFT ALONE WITH CHILDREN ADDING THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS UNNERVING AND FRIGHTENING FOR SOME YOUNG PEOPLE BUT HE SAID THE ADVICE WAS NOT BASED ON THE FEAR THAT SOMETHING AWFUL MIGHT HAPPEN BUT A RULE THAT CHILDREN SHOULD ALWAYS BE CHAPERONED DAME JANET DESCRIBED MISTER ORTIS AS HONEST AND DECENT SAYING SHE WAS SATISFIED HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF ANY CRIMINAL CONDUCT BY SOUTH
A SONG BY TWO FORMER CONTESTANTS ON THE B.B.C. TALENT SHOW THE VOICE HAS BEEN SELECTED TO REPRESENT THE U.K. AT THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST JOE AND JAKE WILL PERFORM YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN STOCKHOLM IN MATE
THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN A CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA A REAL ONE BUT ACTUALLY HELD WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE A HUGE AND IMPORTANT MOMENT MARK LOWE AND OUR CORRESPONDENT YOU HAD HIM IN THE NEWS IS ON THE BORDER BETWEEN SYRIA AND TURKEY AND MARK INDEED YOU WERE SUGGESTING A PIECE FOR THE NEWS THAT THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY THIS CEASEFIRE MIGHT NOT HOLD BUT AT THE MOMENT IT IS
IT'S LOTTIE HOLDING JUSTIN THERE HAS BEEN ONE INCIDENT A CAR BOMB THAT SYRIAN STATE T. V. IS REPORTING HAS EXPLODED IN THE HUM A PROVINCE WHICH IS REGIME CONTROLLED IT'S IN THE CELLAR MIA AREA WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A BREACH OF CEASEFIRE IS A QUESTION I MEAN IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A CLASH IT'S NOT
FIGHTING IT'S NOT AN ATTACK BY AN AIR STRIKE FOR EXAMPLE SO PERHAPS IT JUST BE GLOSSED OVER BUT CLEARLY IT IS A SIGN OF HOW DIFFICULT THINGS ARE ON THE GROUND AND HOW THERE IS A LOT OF SCEPTICISM OR OVER WHETHER THIS TEMPORARY CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES WILL WILL INDEED WHOLE AND EVEN AS WE SPEAK ACTUALLY ROYCE'S ARE REPORTING A SYRIAN REBEL GROUP THEY DON'T SAY WHO SAYING THREE OF ITS FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A GOVERNMENT GROUND ATTACK AFTER THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES CAME INTO
EFFECT THERE ARE GOING TO BE THESE REPORTS SWIRLING AROUND AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE IT SOME TIME TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
I THINK WE WILL IN THIS THE FIRST TIME IF HOLES WILL BE THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE START OF THE WAR IN TWENTY ELEVEN THAT THAT IT WITH THAT WE'LL HAVE HELD AND IT IS VITAL IT IS INTENDED TO BRING HUMANITARIAN RELIEF TO BESIEGED AREAS IT IS INTENDED TO TRY TO BRING ALL THE PLAYERS BACK ROUND THE TABLE REMEMBER THAT THOSE PEACE TALKS COLLAPSED IN GENEVA INTO A KIND OF HEAP OF ACRIMONY A FEW WEEKS AGO THE U.N. SPECIAL ENVOY HAS NOW CALLED ANOTHER SESSION FOR THE SEVENTH OF MARCH A WEEK ON MONDAY AND HOPING THAT IT WILL
IT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE DURING THE CETACEAN FACILITIES SO THERE IS A REAL ATTEMPT TO TRY TO GET THIS TO HOLD NOW BUT OF COURSE A LOT OF SCRIPTS GETS GIVEN HOW MANY DIFFERENT FACTIONS THERE ARE HOW MANY FRONTS THERE ARE STILL RAGING AND SYRIA AND IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT WHAT THE RUSSIANS DECIDE ABOUT THE SEATS FOR HOME WHETHER THEY WANTED TO CARRY ON IN PLACES IS GOING TO BE THE DECISIVE FACTOR
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO THE GAME CHANGER REALLY UP UNTIL NOW MOSCOW HAS CALLED THE WESTERN BACKED OPPOSITION TERRORISTS AND OF COURSE THE RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES ON BEHALF OF THE ASAD REGIME HAVE BEEN THE GAME CHANGER FOR A SAD THEY HAVE BASICALLY ALLOWED HIM TO CONSOLIDATE CONTROL AND TURNED THE WAR IN HIS FAVOUR IN SOME REPORTS THEY'VE BEEN OVER ONE HUNDRED RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES A DAY AROUND ALEPPO FOR EXAMPLE
SO IF MOSCOW DECIDES THAT THEY ARE ONLY GOING TO PURSUE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND THE FRONT GROUP BUT NOT CONTINUE TO HIT THE WESTERN BACKED OPPOSITION THAT POTENTIALLY COULD ALLOW THIS A STATION TO HOLD BUT IT IS A BIG BIG EIGHTH AND THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF SCEPTICISM ON THE GROUND MARK THANK YOU
IT IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THIS TIME LAST WEEKEND BORIS JOHNSON WAS STILL ACCORDING TO HIS OWN TESTIMONY VEERING ALL OVER THE PLACE LIKE A SUPERMARKET TROLLEY NOW THE LEAVE CAMPS LEADING VOICES USED AN INTERVIEW IN THE TELEGRAPH TO URGE TORY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN HIM IN BACKING BRECK'S IT AND ANOTHER IN THE TIMES TO MAKE WHAT THE PAPER CALLS ARE YOU TECHNOPOLIS CORRESPOND ELEANOR GARNIER JOINS US WHAT'S THE U. TURN DOWN YEAH
BORIS JOHNSON EVENTUALLY BROKE HIS SILENCE LAST WEEKEND BACK THE OUT CAMPAIGN AND THEN WROTE IN HIS TELEGRAPH COLUMN THAT HISTORY SHOWS THE Y. YOU ONLY REALLY LISTENED WHEN A POPULATION SAID NO NOW THAT WAS WIDELY INTERPRETED AS BORIS BACK IN THE IDEA OF A SECOND REFERENDUM THE ARGUMENT BEING THAT HE WOULD VOTE TO LEAVE THAT WOULD LEND ALLOW YOU TO NEGOTIATE A FAR BETTER DEAL WITH BRUSSELS
YOU GET A SECOND REFERENDUM AND THAT TIME VOTE TO STAY IN THAT IDEA WAS ALSO FLOATED BY LORD HOWARD YESTERDAY WHO SAID THAT A NO VOTE WOULD SHAKE E.U. LEADERS OUT OF THEIR COMPLACENCY AND QUITE POSSIBLY GIVE THE U.K.
ANOTHER CHANCE AND A CHANCE TO THINK AGAIN DAVID CAMERON HAS INSISTED ALL ALONG VOTING OUT WOULD MEAN OUT HE SAID THE IDEA OF A SECOND REFERENDUM WAS ONE FOR THE BIRDS TODAY BORIS JOHNSON SEEMS TO AGREE WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AT LEAST ON THIS IDEA OF THERE NOT BEING A CHANCE FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM HE SAYS IN THE TIMES OUT HE'S OUT
THEY WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY TO HAVE A SECOND REFERENDUM WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING NOW IS THAT THAT RENEGOTIATION HE SEEMED TO BE TALKING ABOUT NO BUT WHAT HE DOES WANT TO DO IS ONCE BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE IF IT DOES THAT HE CAN THEN HAVE TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT TRADE THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT IN THE TIMES OBVIOUSLY IS CALLING THIS A HUGE U. TURN
PEOPLE VERY CLOSE TO OUR SAYING HE WAS SIMPLY MISINTERPRETED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK PEOPLE MAY BE PUZZLED AS TO WHY THIS ARGUMENT'S TAKING PLACE ON THE LEAVE SIDE SOME PUSHING OTHERS NOT IT'S PARTLY ISN'T IT TO DO WITH WHAT YOU THINK WILL BE POPULAR IN OTHER WORDS WITH YOU THINK PEOPLE BE ATTRACTED BY THE IDEA OF HAVING A SECOND GO
OR WHETHER ACTUALLY GIVEN THE MISSING GAY MIGHT PERSUADE THEM LET'S NOT BOTHER VOTING AT ALL THIS STUFF AND ALSO FOR THOSE WHO ARE NERVOUS ABOUT VOTING FOR NO THIS ARGUMENT THAT YOU MIGHT GET A SECOND CHANCE FURTHER DOWN THE LINE MAY PROVIDE SOME COMFORT AND THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT SOME ON THE LEAVE SITE ON THE LEAVE SIDE ARE PUSHING TO TO MAKE THOSE WHO ARE TEMPTED BUT NOT QUITE SURE WELL IF WE GET ANOTHER CHANCE MAYBE THEY WILL GO FOR IT AND THEN WHEN HIS TELEGRAPH INTERVIEW HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING TO OTHER CABINET MINISTERS ARE BEING ED HE ATTENDS CABINET IS NOT A FULL CABINET MINISTER
BUT COME AND JOIN ME GO ON YOU KNOW YOU ARE YOU'RE A SCEPTIC REALLY WHY DON'T YOU DO WHAT I'VE DONE TRYING TO TEMPT SOME OF THEM OVER I THINK THERE'S TWO IN PARTICULAR HE'S GOT HIS EYE ON THERESA MAY THE HOME SECRETARY SAYS YOUR JOB A BUSINESS SECRETARY BOTH YOU KNOW NEWER SCEPTICS BUT BOTH HAVE BACK DAVID CAMERON'S DEAL AND WE DO ALSO HAVE THIS NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVE M.P.S BACKING BRECHT'S IT SWELLING SO WITH THAT
AND ALSO BIG NAMES LIKE LORD HOWARD COMING OUT IN FAVOUR OF THE LEAVES SIDE THERE IS THIS A MOMENTUM IF YOU LIKE IT IS IN BOULDERING THOSE IN THE PARTY WHO DO YOU WANT TO DEFEAT DAVID CAMERON ON THIS IDEA VERY BRIEFLY THAT MATTERS NOT BECAUSE IT'S A BATTLE IN THE TORY PARTY BECAUSE THEY GET THE VOTE OUT AT LEAST ON THEIR SIDE SO WHO BACKS WHAT CAMP COULD DETERMINE HOW MANY VOTERS OR KNOCKED UP BY SEASONED POLITICAL CAMPAIGNERS HAVE THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND HAVING SOMEONE LIKE LORD HOWDEN BORIS JOHNSON ON SIDE
NOT JUST NIGEL FOR YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE IN THE SAME GROUP AS WILL GIVE THEM THE BIGGER ARGUMENT FOR THAT ELLEN GARNI THANK YOU VERY MUCH NICK THE TIME QUARTER PAST SEVEN TONY BLACKBURN HAS SPOKEN TO BROADCASTING HOUSE ON RADIO FOUR PRIORITIES HIS FIRST BROADCAST INTERVIEW SINCE HE WAS SACKED BY THE B.B.C. EVER THE EVIDENCE HE GAVE TO THE DAME JANET SMITH INQUIRY INQUIRY HAD ASKED MY BLACK BLACKBURN ABOUT HOW THE B. B. SEE MANY YEARS AGO AT HANDLED ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT DOCUMENTS

I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I TOLD THE TRUTH NOW IT'S I SUPPOSE MY WORD AGAINST A JUDGE I'VE GOT NO IDEA THE WHOLE THING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU PADDY BAFFLES ME YOU GO IN THERE IN FRONT OF LAWYERS AND HE'S NOT THAT I WAS BY MYSELF
I TOLD THE TRUTH NOW IF THAT ISN'T UP TO THE B.B.C. STAND AT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT I NEVER SAW THOSE DOCUMENTS TILL TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND I WISH I HAD SEEN THEM AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED PROPERLY BECAUSE THIS
WE WOULDN'T BE IN THE MESS WE ARE IN NOW SO I AM BLAMING THE B.B.C. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE NOW ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE DEAD SO I'M NOT HAVING A GO AT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE B. B. C. NOW THEY SEEM TO BE PROTECTING PEOPLE ARE NOW DEAD I AM SAYING THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE B. B. C. AT THE TIME DID FALL SHORT OF MY STANDARDS BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED
WELL HE SAID THIS WEEK IT PARTED COMPANY WITH TONY BLACKBURN BECAUSE HIS EVIDENCE FELL SHORT OF THE STANDARDS OF EVIDENCE NECESSARY FOR THE INQUIRY AND MY BACK THEN TELL PADDY ECONOMY WAS GIVEN A CHOICE BY HIS BOSS EITHER RESIGN OR BE
BOB SHERMAN HEAD OF RADIO TWO I LIKE VERY MUCH AND A LAWYER CAME IN HERE AND SAID THAT ON THE SECOND OCCASION WE MET SO THAT THEY WERE SEVERING ALL THINK OF ME ACTUALLY I MEAN I HAD BEEN ASKED TO RESIGN
AND I SAID WELL WHY DO I WANT TO RESIGN HE WAS NO POINT I HAVEN'T I LOVE MY JOB AT THE B.B.C. I LOVE THE B. B. C. WHY WHEN I RESIGN THEY GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO RESIGN WITH THAT SAYING THAT THAT WHERE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY CUT OF ALL TIMES WILL BE B. C. AND WE COULD PROBABLY BRING YOU BACK IN A FEW MONTHS I DON'T THINK PEOPLE KNEW THAT BUT I SAID NO I WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I'VE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE
DWELLING HERE THE FULL INTERVIEW WITH TONY BLACKBURN ON B.H. TOMORROW NINE O'CLOCK IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN TIME TO GO TO WESTMINSTER WHERE A NEW PARLIAMENTARY CHARACTER WAS BORN YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT HERE'S MARK DARCY
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS LINES UTTERED IN PARLIAMENT WAS KING CHARLES THE FIRST'S I SEE MY BIRDS HAVE FLOWN THE LINE WITH WHICH THAT DOOMED MONARCH KICKED OFF THE ENGLISH CIVIL WAR WHEN HE TOOK TROOPS INTO THE CHAMBER OF THE COMMONS TO ARREST A DISSIDENT EM PEAS YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT A BIRD FLEW INTO THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND DELIVER THE LINE THAT MIGHT JUST BECOME ALMOST AS FAMOUS SOMEONE SAID TO ME HOW DID YOU GET INTO THE HOUSE OF LORDS
I SAID BY LYING CHEATING AND STEALING THE BIRD IN QUESTION IS LORD JOHN BIRD FOUNDER OF THE BIG ISSUE MAGAZINE AND NOW ACROSS SPENT SURE INDEPENDENT PEER IN HIS MAIDEN SPEECH HE RECALLED THE MENTORS WHO HAD GUIDED HIM THROUGH HIS TROUBLED EARLY YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY PROBATION OFFICER
MY PROBATION OFFICER WHEN I WAS TEN STOOD BESIDE ME
AND INSTEAD OF CHASTISING ME AS A POST WAR STATISTIC ENCOURAGED ME TO READ AND TO WRITE EVEN THOUGH IT TOOK ME MANY YEARS TO MASTER THOSE ARE
ONE OF THE REASONS HE DID MASTER THEM WAS THE PIONEERING SOCIAL CAMPAIGNER BARONESS WOOTTON HIS LOCAL YOUTH MAGISTRATE AND LATER ONE OF THE FIRST WOMAN LIFE PEERS TO SIT IN THE LORDS BUT ABSOLUTE MARVELLOUS WOMAN WHO WHEN I WAS TEN PUT ME ON PROBATION WHEN I WAS TWELVE
MAKE ME A WARD OF COURT WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN PUT ME IN A REMAND HOME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN SENT ME FOR A SHORT SHOP SHOP WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN TOOK ME FROM A BOYS' PRISON AND PUT ME BACK INTO AN OAR INTO A REFORMATORY SO I COULD LEARN TO READ AND WRITE
HE SAID ONE OF THE REASONS HE WAS CONVINCED TO FOUND THE BIG ISSUE WAS HIS LACK OF SENTIMENTALITY ABOUT POVERTY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH POVERTY NO LONGER SHOOK AND GET OUT OF IT YOU'RE GOING TO BE STRONGER AND FITTER AND BETTER
AND YOU DON'T WANNA STAY ALWAYS STOPPING YOU AND IMPEDING YOU FROM GETTING OUT OF POVERTY
MEANWHILE OVER IN THE COMMONS M.P.S WERE DEBATING A BILL TO GIVE UP TO SIX MILLION U.K. EXPATS ARE VOTED ELECTIONS AND REFERENDUMS AND THEY WERE SLIGHTLY STARTLED BY THE PROMISE OF ACTION FROM THE CABINET OFFICE MINISTER JOHN PENROSE THERE A PARLIAMENTARY DRAFTSMEN EVEN NOW BEAVERING AWAY AT HIGH SPEED ON SOMETHING WHICH HAS ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT POSSIBLE WORKING TITLES INCLUDING OVERSEAS ELECTORS OVERSEAS VOTERS ALL SORTS OF OTHER POSSIBILITIES BUT WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT
HANGING AROUND ON THIS WE ARE MOVING FORWARD AND IT TURNED OUT THOSE WERE NOT THE ONLY WRITERS BEING ENLISTED TO BOOST ELECTORAL REGISTRATION WHEN LABOUR COMPLAIN THAT GOVERNMENT POLICIES WERE DRIVING PEOPLE OFF THE ELECTORAL REGISTER AT HOME MY PENROSE REVEALED THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION'S SURPRISING STRATEGY TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE TO REGISTER I HOPE I'M NOT ACTING OR SOME TERRIBLE PLOT SPOILER HIM WAS DEPUTY SPEAKER BUT UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THEY'RE INTENDING WITH WITH THE RISE OF HOLLYOAKS TO TRY AND BLEND THROUGH THE STORY LINE OF THAT THAT'S
SOME KIND OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND INFORMATION ABOUT WHITE SUPPORT THE REGISTER HOW TO REGISTER AND SO ON AND SO FORTH
SO MAYBE CHANNEL FOUR'S TEEN SOAP WHERE THIS WEEK A BRIDE WAS REVEALED TO BE SLEEPING WITH HER HUSBAND'S TWIN BROTHER ON HER WEDDING DAY IS ABOUT TO UNDERGO A SURPRISING PLOT TWIST WHERE USUAL END OF PROGRAMME HELPLINE ANNOUNCEMENT SWITCH SUBJECTS FROM SEX AND DRUGS TO VOTER REGISTRATION
MARK DARCY ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT IF YOU WANNA HEAR MORE EIGHT THIRTY ON B. B. C. A RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE IT'S SEVEN TWENTY ONE SHOULD IMMIGRANTS CONFORM FITTED ASSIMILATE WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT WELCOME THEM IN
OR SHOULD WE BE CONTEMPT FOR THEM TO PROUDLY MAINTAIN AND PROCLAIM THEIR SEPARATE IDENTITY THAT'S A QUESTION RAISED ONCE AGAIN BY THE STORY BERNARD AND WIN THE CHILDREN OF GERMAN JEWISH IMMIGRANTS WHOSE LETTERS FORM THE BASIS OF A NEW BOOK BY IAN BHA RUMOUR THEIR PROMISED LAND MY GRANDPARENTS IN LOVE AND WALKED I'D SAY THAT HE WAS IN THE STUDIO WITH US DO THOSE LETTERS WHEN YOU FOUND THEM WHEN YOU STUDIED THEM REVEAL THEM IAN IS OUTSIDERS
INSIDERS ALL ULTIMATELY BOTH I THINK ULTIMATELY BOTH BUT WERE BORN HERE AND GREW UP IN HAMPSTEAD WHERE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS WOULD BE GRANDFATHER WENT TO BOARDING SCHOOL HE WENT TO OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE AND SIAN SAY THEY WERE BRITISH IN EVERY RESPECT EXCEPT FOREIGN NAME THAT FOREIGN PARENTS
AND THEY WERE FROM A JEWISH BACKGROUND AND CERTAINLY IN THE NINETEEN THOSE DAYS THE NINETEEN TENS TWENTIES THIRTIES AND SO ON
THAT MEANT YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS TREATED AS AN INSIDER AND THAT GAVE THEM THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS I THINK ALWAYS OF NOT BEING ENTIRELY IN THE CENTRE OF THINGS HE'S AWARE NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THAT BUT ALSO YOUR EVENT BUT BERNARD I'M SORRY
DIDN'T GET A JOB AT A HOSPITAL AND OBVIOUSLY HIS IMAGES OF WERE THEY DID THEY WERE TOO PROUD TO COMPLAIN OF ANTI CENOTES AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THEIR CLASS MANAGED TO DODGE IT BY IGNORING IT KNOWING WHERE IT WAS LIKELY OR IT WASN'T AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT THERE ARE A FEW OCCASIONS IN THE CORRESPONDENCE WHERE IT BECOMES VERY CLEAR AND ONE WAS WHEN HE WAS IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT
WHEN HE WAS TURNED DOWN FOR A JOB AT ONE OF THE LONDON HOSPITALS AND THEY WERE SO OFTEN SNOBBISH INSTITUTIONS AND HE SAID TO HER IT'S THE OLD OLD STORY AND THAT'S WHAT LED HIM BOTH OF THEM TO RESCUE TWENTY TWELVE CHILDREN FROM BERLIN ON THE KINDER TRANSPORT IN A STRIKING LETTER FROM YOUR GRANDMOTHER WIN ABOUT THE FACT THAT AT OXFORD SHE SAW HERSELF AS THE ONLY DUET
WELL I THINK SHE PROBABLY WAS SHE WAS AT SAINT HILDA'S AND IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS PROBABLY HIGHLY UNUSUAL BUT SHE FELT MORE AWKWARD ABOUT IT THEY'RE MY GRANDFATHER AND I THINK THE IRONY THERE IS THAT HE GREW UP IN AN ORTHODOX HOUSEHOLD HIS FATHER WAS ORTHODOX SO IT LEASE YOU KNEW HER JEWISHNESS WAS ABOUT SHE GREW AND GREW UP IN AN ENTIRELY SECULAR FAMILY AND REALLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ABOUT SO I THINK THAT MADE HER LESS COMFORTABLE WITH IT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT STORIES STORIES OF TWO PEOPLE BUT OF COURSE IS ALSO ABOUT THIS GREAT ISSUE OF CONFORMITY AND WHETHER ONE SHOULD OR NOT
I WAS STRUCK BY THE PHRASE YOU USED AT SOME TODAY LOOKING BACK WOULD SEE THEIR BEHAVIOUR THEIR BELIEF THAT THEY WERE MORE ENGLISH AND ENGLISH AS A FORM OF DENIAL OR COMPLICITY YES I WILL I THINK PARTLY THIS IS A QUESTION OF CLASS AND I THINK YOU FIND THAT WITH ALL MINORITIES IN IMMIGRANTS THAT THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS WHO MOVE UP INTO THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS OR TEND TO BE MORE ASSIMILATED AND SO ON
BUT I THINK SINCE MULTICULTURALISM AND THE SORT OF IDEOLOGY THAT YOU HAVE TO STICK TO THE CULTURE OF YOUR ANCESTORS AND OTHERWISE YOUR SUMMER IN AUTHENTIC THIS HAS BECOME AN ISSUE THAT YOU HAD TO ASSERT YOUR IDENTITY AND SO ON
SUMMING UP MY GRANDMOTHER THERE WAS NO WAY OF ASSERTING ANY OTHER IDENTITY SHE WAS BRITISH BUT SHE WASN'T ALWAYS TREATED AS SUCH AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THE DIFFERENCE NOW SURELY IS PARTLY ONE OF SCALE THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE AS IT WERE LIKE YOU IF YOU'RE AN IMMIGRANT WHO ARE HERE AND CAN BE PARTLY ONE OF TECHNOLOGY IT IS POSSIBLE TO STAY IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY MENTALLY YOU CAN WATCH TWENTY FOUR HOUR NEWS IN YOUR OWN LANGUAGE FROM YOUR OWN COUNTRY YOU COULD READ YOUR OWN NEWSPAPERS IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE THAT SENSE
THE PAST IS NOT A TREMENDOUS GOD IF YOU TRY THAT'S TRUE BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT AFFECTS THE CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS WHICH YOU'RE RIGHT AND OF COURSE A LOT OF THE THE THE RADICAL ISLAMISTS CONVERT TO A KIND OF ISLAM THAT THEIR PARENTS NEVER HAD THROUGH THE INTERNET IN ENGLISH NOT IN ARABIC SO THAT IS TRUE
AND I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE WHEN MY GRANDPARENTS GREW UP IF YOU DECIDED YOU WERE GOING TO BE FRENCH OR BRITISH CONFORM TO THE CULTURE IN WHICH WE WERE BORN THE CONFORMITY WOOD WAS TOTAL IN A WAY THAT NOW HE'S PROBABLY LESS CALLED FOR HIMBA ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT BOOK THEIR PROMISED LAND MY GRANDPARENTS IN LOVE AND WAR
AND THE TIME JUST COMING UP TO TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SEVEN GARY'S HERE THE RUGBY'S UP AND RUNNING UP AND GRINDING I SUPPOSE YOU BETTER SAY AFTER LAST NIGHT ANYWAY NO IT WAS IT WAS A BETTER SECOND HALF WAS IT WASN'T IT WHAT DID YOU THINK NINETEEN TEN WHALES ONE GEORGE NORTH SCORED A TRY AND HE SUMMED UP THE MATCH LIKE THIS I THINK TO SAY I THINK A POSITION WE STYLED LOVE US THOUGH AND WE'RE HOPING TO AN ISLAND WITH A DRAWER AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT PERFORMANCES TODAY WAS IN THE BEST BUT IT WAS A WIN WE NEED A VENDOR DAY KEEP US IN CONTENTION
WE'VE GOT TO FOLLOW WE COMING UP FINANCE TO BE GAMES FOLLOW HIM I THINK IN A GOOD POSITION SO WELLS NINETEEN FRANCE TEN THIS AFTERNOON ENGLAND FACE ISLAND WITH THE MATCH AT TWICKENHAM GETTING UNDERWAY AT FOUR FIFTY OR RUGBY REPORTER CHRIS JONES IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE COMMENTATORS THIS AFTERNOON HELLO CHRIS THEY CARRY THE ENGLAND AT ALL FORMER WORLD CUP WINNING COACH SIR CLIVE WOODWARD SAYS TODAY IN THE MAIL THIS IS A GAME ENGLAND MUST WIN YES UNTIL DYLAN HARTLEY THE ENGLAND CAPTAIN HAS BEEN QUITE COUNTED APART IT CALLING IT ENGLAND'S

A MUST WIN GAME AT TWICKENHAM IT WILL IT WILL HE SAYS A PROPER MATCH BUT IT'S STILL NEVER LESS THAN AN IRISH SIDE THAT HAS QUITE A FEW INJURIES YES HAVING SAID ALL THAT ABOUT HER BEING ENGLAND'S BIGGEST TEST SO FAR IT IS INSIDE THAT THAT STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT THEY ARE THE DOUBLE SIX NATIONS CHAMPIONS BUT IT'S NOT BEEN PINCHED AT ALL SO FAR A DRAWER AND A LOST THEIR WORST START IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT OF COURSE THEY'RE MISSING SOME KEY PLAYERS BECAUSE OF INJURIES THEIR TALISMAN PAUL O'CONNELL HAS RETIRED FOR INTERNATIONAL ROBBIE BUT THEY'VE STRUGGLED TO SCORE TRIES JUST ONE
TRY IN THEIR FIRST TWO GAMES THEIR GAME PLAN CALLED INTO QUESTION LITTLE I THINK A LOT OF FANS AT TWICKENHAM NEUTRAL OR NOT WILL BE HOPING FOR FOR A BIT MORE CREATIVE INVENTIVE FARE THAN WE SAW LAST QUICK WORD SCOTLAND AGAINST ITALY OVER IN ROME IS THE DAY WHEN SCOTLAND ARE FINALLY GOING TO WIN US ALMOST AS MUCH AGAIN WHAT OF WHAT A BIG GAME FOR SCOTLAND THEY'VE LOST NINE IN A ROW IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND ALL THAT POST WORLD CUP OPTIMISM HAS BEEN CRUSHED A LITTLE WITH THAT THE OPENING A COUPLE OF THE FEET SO IT'S PIVOTAL FOR SCOTLAND
THEY WANT TO BE COMPETING AT THE TOP END OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP UNDER FEARNE COTTON NOT SCRAPPING AROUND TRYING TO AVOID THE WOODEN SPOON IF THEY LOSE THAT'S WHAT THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING UP THE SECOND YEAR IN A RACE A MASSIVE GAME IN ROME FOR THE SCOTS CHRIS JONES THANK YOU AND FIVE LIFE WILL BRING YOU COMMENTARY AT FROM TEN MINUTES TO FIVE GIANNI INFANT TINO SAYS HE'LL RESTORE THE IMAGE OF FEVER AFTER BEING VOTED IN ITS NEW PRESIDENT IN THE F.A.

THANK YOU CHRIS IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT STOP TRIDENT STOP THE NUKES THAT CHAR WILL BE ON THE LIPS OF TENS OF THOUSANDS WILL GATHER UNDER MARBLE ARCH FOR A MASS RALLY ORGANISED BY SEA INDEED THE CAMPAIGN FOR NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT THIS LUNCHTIME AND ONE MAN WHOSE WORDS WILL ALSO BE QUOTED ARE THE FORMER U.S. DEFENCE SECRETARY DOCTOR WILLIAM PERRY YOU SERVED UNDER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON HIS NEW BOOK MY JOURNEY AT THE NUCLEAR BRINK
WARNS THAT THE DANGER OF A NUCLEAR CATASTROPHE IS NOW GREATER THAN DURING THE COLD WAR I SPOKE TO A LITTLE EARLIER AND ASKED HIM WHETHER WE NOW STOOD AT THAT NUCLEAR BRINK
I FEAR THAT WE ARE APPROACHING ANOTHER NICOLA I DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BANK AT THIS MOMENT NO FEAR IT BECAUSE BECAUSE
THE CONDITIONS FOR THE BRINK I THINK NOW WHICH IS ANTAGONISM EVEN HOSTILITY BETWEEN RUSSIA ON THE ONE HAND A NATO ON THE PARTICULARLY UNITED STATES ANNOUNCE HOSTILITY IF IT CAN IF IT'S MIXED WITH AN INCIDENT CAN PUT HIS BACK TO THE BRICK IN PARTICULAR RUSSIA MAKES IT PRETTY CLEAR PRESENT COULDN'T HAVE MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR THEN TAMMY FIELDS ARE SECURITY RUSHES THREATEN YOUR FROCK REALLY USE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN USED IN YEARS TIM DO YOU YOU DON'T NEED AS IT WERE TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION FOR THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAT AND WATCHED THE SCREENS AS THE POSSIBILITY OF A NUCLEAR CONFLAGRATION SOMETIMES BY MISCALCULATION SOMETIMES BY SHEER MISTAKE WAS THERE
I WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED WITH THREE DIFFERENT TIMES IN THOSE TIME MADE A VERY DEEP IMPRESSION ON ME IS HOW CLOSE WE ACTUALLY CAME TO A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST SIR BACK IN SEVENTY NINE IT WAS WAS IT THAT YOU WERE
SEEING NUCLEAR MISSILES APPARENTLY ON THEIR WAY FROM THE SOVIET UNION I WAS WOKEN AT THREE O'CLOCK AND A MORNING PHONE CALL FROM THEY WERE DRAFTED TO SEND MEN WHO STARTED AFTER CONVERSATION BY TELLING ME HIS COMPUTERS WERE SHOWING TWO HUNDRED NESTLES ON THE WAY
FROM THE SOVIET UNION TO THAN STAY TILL YOU CAN I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WILL BE UP IMMEDIATELY NOW OF COURSE THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A FALSE ALARM BUT THERE WAS AN INSIDIOUS FOX I'M AT ONE WHICH WAS VERY HARD TO DETECT AS A FOSSIL ALARM HAVING SAID ALL OF THIS ISN'T THE PROPER REACTION OF A GOVERNMENT
TO AN AGGRESSOR IN THIS CASE POUSSIN SOMEONE WHO'S PREPARED TO RE ARM SOMEONE WHO POTENTIALLY IS EVEN WILLING TO THREATEN OR TO USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO KEEP YOUR OWN AND INDEED TO RENEW THEM AS YOU KNOW I HAVE LONG SUPPORTED REDUCING EVENTUALLY GET HIM DOWN TO ZERO
I DON'T BELIEVE IT EITHER WITH THE PRESENT AGGRESSIVE IMPORTERS OF RUSHING THE DAY WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN SOME LEVEL AN IGLOO DETERRENTS BUT WE MUST NOT BOND THE TRAP I SIMPLY MIMICKING WHAT RUSHES DURAN WE DO NOT WANT TO START ANOTHER NUCLEAR ARMS RACE LIKE WE HAD DURING THE COLD WAR DO YOU TALKED OF RESTRUCTURING OF REDUCING THE UNITED STATES IS NUCLEAR DETERRENT WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ABOUT WHETHER IT SHOULD SPEND BILLIONS RENEWING THE TRIDENT SYSTEM AND THE BRITISH I THINK HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS TO MAKE
ONE OF WHICH IS THE SAME AS WE HAVE TO MAKE AS TO WHETHER THERE WILL BE NO RON I'M GOING TO USE TO SUBMARINES IN THE FUTURE AND THEN OF COURSE IS THIS ISSUE OF COST AND EACH GOVERNMENT HAD TO MAKE A SOUND DECISION THAT I WOULD PRESUME TO ADVISE THE BRITISH GO ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT CHRIST ISSUE BUT IN OTHER WORDS YOU THINK THEIR TRIED AND DECISION IS A PRACTICAL WARM IS ONE ABOUT PRICE
NOT ONE DRIVEN PURELY BY MORALITY BECAUSE PEOPLE HEARING YOUR WARNINGS OF REACHING THE NUCLEAR BRINK MIGHT HAVE ASSUMED YOU DEN SAY ONE WAY NOT TO REACHES IS TO CANCEL THEIR TRIED AND RENEWAL AND I WOULD NOT MAKE THAT RECOMMENDATION I'M FACT I WOULDN'T PRESUME TO ADVISE THE BRIDGE COMING AT ALL RIGHT NURSE BUT I AM RECOMMENDING THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT GO AHEAD WITH THIS STRAIN PROGRAMME BUT CANCELLED A BIT STRUCK FAIZAL DOES I.C.B.M. PROGRAMME SYNDICATE NOBLER STICK MY PROGRAMME
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT TO SOMEONE WHO IS PREPARING TO GO ON A MARCH TODAY IN CENTRAL LONDON AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONS PERHAPS HAS HEARD YOUR WORDS THAT THE DANGER OF A NUCLEAR CATASTROPHE IS NOW GREATER THAN DURING THE COLD WAR AND THINGS THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY TAKE A STAND AGAINST THIS
IS TO DO WHAT YOU CAN AND CANCEL THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAMME THE BRITAIN CURRENTLY HAS WELL I THINK THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD ACT ON THE RELEASE AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO PARTY I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS THE PROPER RESPONSE TO THE PRESENT SITUATION I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD DO THAT ONLY DISARM I THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE RUSSIANS AND UP TO A FEW YEARS AGO I THOUGHT AS EVERY PROSPECT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO A MARTYR WITH THE RUSSIANS AS WILLING PARTNERS IT'S ONLY BEEN THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS I CAN SEE THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE
JUST FINALLY DOCTOR PERRY IT'S NOT EVERY DAY WE GET TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO WAS A WITNESS TO THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS YOU WERE THERE JUST HOW FRIGHTENING WAS IT WELL I WAS CALLED BACK TO BE A CONSULTANT ON THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THAT ROOM WITH A RUSSIAN RESOURCE OUT NOW IS ASKED TO EXAMINE ALL THE PHOTOS AND I WAS AS THEY'D GATHERED MEETS NIGHT WE PREPARED A REPORT
BASED ON INTELLIGENCE THAT DAY THERE WAS WHICH WOULD PRESENT CAN HE STARTED HIS DAY OFF WITH THE DEAD GUY WAS HIS DECISIONS AND THAT DAY SO HE'S A VERY TENSE PERIOD TO ME BED DOWN TO YOUR QUESTION EVERY DAY THAT I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE MY LAST DAY ON EARTH
AND I STILL BELIEVE WE AVOIDED A NUCLEAR CATASTROPHE AS MUCH WHY GOOD LUCK AS WE DID BYE GOOD PLANNING
IT'S A CHILLING THOUGHT DOCTOR PERRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED YOU'RE WELCOME LISTENING TO AND DUE TO SPEAK AT THE RALLY ONE OF THREE PARTY LEADERS WILL BE DOING THAT JEREMY CORBIN OF LABOUR OF COURSE NICOLA STURGEON AT THE S.N.P. AND LIGHTS THEY WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY PLIED COMMIS LEANNE WOOD
HIS WORDS WERE CHILLING WHERE THEY NOT LEANNE WOOD BUT HE WAS CLEAR UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT IS NOT THE RIGHT RESPONSE TO THAT FEAR
BOARDED A AND YES HE'S WEIRD TO A CHILLING INDEED AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT ANOTHER FALSE ALARM THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT A NUCLEAR WAR BY ACCIDENT IS TO DISARM AND WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT HE HOPED THAT REST AND TO THE UNITED STATES WOULD DECIDE THAT ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN IF MORE MONEY IS SPENT ON CUCKOO WEARING THESE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT THEY WOULD EVER BE UNLEASHED ON A POPULATION BUT A UNILATERAL DECISION BY BRITAIN TO DISARM IT WOULDN'T MATTER WORST BE DANGEROUS AND AT BEST BE A RELEVANT IT WOULD MAKE US FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT MIGHT SAVE SOME MONEY BUT IT WOULD NOT AFFECT THE DECISIONS OF RUSSIA THE UNITED STATES CHINA OTHER NUCLEAR POWERS WHY DO WE NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT AND I SEE IT NUCLEAR WEAPONS AS A RELIC FROM THE COLD WAR AND IF WE DON'T WANT TO RETURN AND A REPEAT OF THE COLD WAR THEY SHOULD BE NOW CONSIGN CONSIGNED TO THE DUSTBIN OF HISTORY
AND THE CON YOU SAY WHY SHOULD WE NEED INVOLVED ARE YOU EFFECTIVELY SAID IN A SENSE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER A DECISION AFFECTS OTHER COUNTRIES WE HOPE IT WOULD WE'D ARGUE THAT IT SHOULD BUT IN THE END LET'S JUST HAVE NO PART OF THIS WITH THE COLD WAR WAS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE U.S.S.R. AS WAS AND SO IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM BETWEEN THOSE TWO ENTITIES IN THE FUTURE WAY DOES THE U.K. NEED TO BE INVOLVED WE'VE GOT PEOPLE ON FOOT BANKS WE'VE GOT CHILD POVERTY AT RECORD LEVELS HERE
THE PROPOSAL IS TO SPEND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS OVER THERE OR THEREABOUTS OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS ON PROCURE COOKIE IN WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION I DON'T SEE HOW THAT CAN BE JUSTIFIED WITHIN THE WITHIN THAT CONTEXT
NO THERE ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT FIGURE IS IT AS YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAID MUM IT WAS LESS THAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT IT'S MUCH LESS THAT LESLEY'S A TOTAL WILL DO WITH THE PRINCIPAL THE ONLY INDIAN IT WOULD BE TO HAVE SOME SAYS TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE BUT MOVING ON THE LET'S DEAL WITH THE PRINCIPLE THE PRINCIPLE ARGUMENT THAT IS MADE BY THOSE WHO BACK TRIDENT IS IT PROTECTS US FROM NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL IN OTHER WORDS IF PUTIN WHAT TO SAY OR SOMEONE ELSE IN THE FUTURE
DO WHAT ONLY DEMAND OR SIT BACK AND LET ME DO WHAT I WANT OTHERWISE I WILL ATTACK YOU WERE NUCLEAR WEAPONS THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THE DETERRENT ACCESS SOME SORT OF WAY OF COUNTERING
BUT IT HASN'T ACTED AS A DETERRENT IN TERMS OF PREVENTING WARS HAS IT BECAUSE HAVE ALREADY BEEN WARS THAT BRITAIN HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND HAVING NUCLEAR WEAPONS HASN'T MADE WAY FOR FOR MORE PIECE AND WHAT ARE THE THREATS THAT WE FACE IN THE U.K. AT THE MOMENT AND EUROPE I WOULD SAY THAT THEY ARE FROM LORNE WOLF TERRORISTS OR WHAT IS KNOWN AS RADICALISATION
AND SUICIDE BOMBERS WON'T BE STOPPED BY THREATENING TO DROP A NUCLEAR BOMB ON A CITY SOMEWHERE FOR THAT YOU NEED GOOD INTELLIGENCE EFFECTIVE POLICING AND THIS MONEY IF IT'S NOT SPENT ON BENEFIT IN PEOPLE I WOULD ARGUE SHOULD BE SPENT ON THOSE KINDS OF OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR POPULATION LIAM WOULD APPLY COMING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WILL HIPS AND PROTESTERS AFTER TEN PAST EIGHT AND A FORMER LABOUR DEFENCE SECRETARIES IN FAVOUR OF TROY
I KNOW NINETY MINUTES TO EIGHT AND A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND BORIS JOHNSON STILL GRABBING THE HEADLINES IN THE TELEGRAPH OR THE TIMES AFTER SPEAKING TO BOTH PAPERS HAVE HAD HIS CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE MAYOR OF LONDON IS URGING CABINET MINISTERS IN FAVOUR OF E.U. MEMBERSHIP TO RECONSIDER THEIR POSITION THE PAPER ALSO SUGGEST THE POLL OF GRASSROOTS CONSERVATIVES NOW PUTS MY JOHNSON AHEAD OF GEORGE OSBORNE AND ANY FUTURE CONTEST TO BECOME PARTY LEADER THE TIMES EDITORIAL WELCOMES THE MAYOR'S CLARIFICATION THAT OUT HE'S OUT WITH NO CHANCE OF A SECOND REFERENDUM BUT IT SAYS
IT'S RISKY IT WILL BE SEIZED ON BY ITS CRITICS AS A U. TURN THE ARTICLES THIS IS POLITICAL VIAGRA AS THE MOST POPULAR POLITICIAN IN THE COUNTRY HAS HELPED TRANSFORM THEIR CAMPAIGN THE GUARDIAN LEADS WITH NEW CLAIMS ABOUT MISTREATMENT OF INMATES AT A YOUTH PRISON RUN BY G.FOUR.S. IT SAYS THERE WERE COMPLAINTS OF ABUSE AND BULLYING AT THE MEDWAY SECURE TRAINING CENTRE IN KENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE BUT NOTHING WAS DONE ELEVEN STAFF AT SUSPENDED OR SACK LAST MONTH
AFTER A B.B.C. DOCUMENTARY G.FOUR.S. IS NOW SELLING IT CHILD SERVICES BUSINESS THE GUARDIAN SPOKEN TO FORMER INMATES HAVE MADE NEW ALLEGATIONS INCLUDING ONE WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WAS LOCKED IN A CELL ALONE AND SHE SUFFERED A MISCARRIAGE DUE FOR S. AT THEIR COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH ADEQUATE THE DAILY MAIL COVERS WHAT HE CALLS AN EXPLOSIVE NEW BIOGRAPHY OF TONY BLAIR BY THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER TOMBA THERE ARE CLAIMS THAT MISTER BLAIR
PRESIDED OVER A SILENT CONSPIRACY TO CHANGE THE FACE OF BRITAIN WITH MASS IMMIGRATION BY ALLOWING MINISTERS TO WADE THROUGH THOUSANDS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS AS ECONOMIC MIGRANTS BOOK ALSO ESTIMATES THAT UNDER NEW LABOUR THEY WERE TWO MILLION MORE IMMIGRANTS THAN THE GOVERNMENT WAS EXPECTING THE DAILY MIRROR LEADS ON WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS THE TRAGEDY OF BRAVE TWINS IT'S GOT PICTURES OF HER THREE YEAR OLD GIRL WITH CEREBRAL PALSY IS LEARNING TO WALK AFTER N.H.S. TRIAL SURGERY WHILE HE CLAIMS HER TWIN BROTHER HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR
HAS BEEN DENIED THE VERY SAME OPERATION THE PARENTS OF LILIAN EVA ELBOW AND FROM HULL TELL THE PEOPLE OF THEIR HEARTBREAK WHEN THEIR SON ASK IF HE CAN WALK
LIKE HIS SISTER THE PAPERS BACKING A FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN TO HAVE THE OPERATION ABROAD SEVERAL PAPERS FEATURE A NEW EXHIBITION ON THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM SHALL WE TAKE A TRIP ASKED THE INDEPENDENT EXPLAIN THAT VISITORS WILL BE BLASTED WITH SOUND AND DAZZLING LIGHTS AS THE EXHIBITION EXPLORES HOW DRUGS MUSIC FASHION ART CHALLENGE THE POWER STRUCTURES AT THE TIME THE TELEGRAPHS LEADER COLUMN WONDERS WHETHER THOSE WHO REMEMBER THE SIXTIES MAY LOOK BACK ON THE WHOLE THING WITH A MODICUM OF EMBARRASSED
PERISH THE THOUGHT IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAS AN UNUSUAL ANGLE ON BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. IT REPORTS THE BRUSSELS IS SO SENSITIVE ABOUT THE BRITISH LOVE OF TEA AND TOAST IT SHELVE PLANS TO LIMIT THE USE OF HIGH POWERED KETTLES AND TOASTERS UNTIL
YOU GUESSED IT AFTER THE REFERENDUM IN JUNE THE PAPER SAYS THE COMMISSION IS MINDFUL OF THE FUSS IN THE U.K. WHEN IT EMERGED IT WANTED TO BAN POWERFUL VACUUM CLEANERS
ALTHOUGH OFFICIALS TELL THE PAPER THERE WOULD BE NO SPECIAL FAVOURS HE CONCLUDES THAT HE WAS TRYING TO AVOID WHAT IT CALLS A CLUMSY INTERVENTION THAT COULD SEND BRICKS IT PASSIONS WAIT FOR IT
BOILING OVER T. QUARTER TO EIGHT WHY DOES THE ANCIENT SYSTEM OF CASTS HAVE SUCH AN INFLUENCE IN MODERN INDIA THIS WEEK END
I SAW A LARGE SCALE PROCESS CLOSE TO THE CAPITAL DELHI NINETEEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED BILLIONS OF POUNDS' WORTH OF THAT PROPERTY WAS DESTROYED THE PROTESTERS WERE FROM THE JAZZ COMMUNITY DEMANDING CAST BASED JOB QUOTAS B. SEE CENTRAL IMAGE AND TRAVELLED TO THE TOWN OF ROW TACT
THAT'S MAIN HIGH STREET IS LINED WITH SHOPS ON EITHER SIDE AND IS A BUSY THOROUGHFARE FOR LOCAL TRAFFIC BUT MANY OF THE SHOPS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED BEYOND RECOGNITION
I JUST WALKING INSIDE WHAT USED TO BE A SHOPPING MALL OR CINNAMON ON THE TOP FLOOR
AND RIGHT NEXT TO ME THE LOCAL MCDONALD'S NOW ALL THAT REMAINS IS A BONE SHELL AND THE REMNANTS OF A POSTER ADVERTISING THE PIG
THIS IS MY BUILDING WITH A SHORT LITTLE SILENCE HERE SUE JANIE JONES ONE OF THE BUILDINGS THAT'S BEEN BURNT
THAT WAS THEIR FIRST LOT OF MACK'S LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
BUT I WAS PROBABLY DESTROY THEM AS A BUILDING AND THEN BON HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN
PAUL DON'T PEOPLE THE RIOTERS WERE GIANTS ARE RELATIVELY AFFLUENT UPPER CASTE FARMING COMMUNITY THEY DEMANDED THAT THEY BE INCLUDED IN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION QUOTAS RESERVED AT THE MOMENT FOR LOW CASTES DOING SO WOULD GUARANTEE THEM GOVERNMENT JOBS AND UNIVERSITY PLACES
WHY WOULD THE JUT EFFECTIVELY WANT TO SLIDE DOWN THE CAST LADDER IT DOESN'T TAKE ME LONG TO FIND
JUST A SHORT DRIVE FROM TOWN
AND YOU IMMEDIATELY TRANSPORTED INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE ALL AROUND ME ARE BRIGHT GREEN RICE AND WHEAT FIELDS THERE'S A POND IN THE MIDDLE
WITH WATER BUFFALOES INSIDE THAT THIS LAND IS SHRINKING FAST
MUCH OF THIS WOULD BE SWALLOWED UP BY THE CITY
MY NAME IS JUDGE BEEP AND I'M A FARMER THE GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THE LAND AND GIVES IT TO INDUSTRIALIST AND DEV LEPUS WE HARDLY HAVE ANY LAND LEFT WE HAVE BEEN COMPENSATED AND TRIED TO SET UP OUR OWN BUSINESS IS WITH THE MONEY
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT IT WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE DONE IT FOR MUCH LONGER WHEN SAY ALREADY WORKED WITH MONEY HAS COME THE PUSH TO TRY AND IMPROVE THINGS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION BROUGHT TOOK AS FULL OF COLLEGES OFFERING A WIDE RANGE OF DEGREES BUT WHEN I MEET A GROUP OF YOUNG CHARTS IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT MERELY HAVING AN EDUCATION IS NOT ENOUGH TO LAND YOU WERE JOB ALMOST ALL BOYS ARE GOOD
FROM THE RELATED ON TOUR ENDED THERE BUT THAT IS HOW YOU THINK IT IS BUT STILL THEY DON'T HAVE ANY DOOR BENNISH AGAIN SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU CAN'T FIND JOBS WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR I AM DEBATING FOR I'VE GOT A DOG BONE OF THE DONNA WE DO NOT HAVE THE LAND
FOR A FUTURE GENERATION SOME NOW WONDERING IF INDIA'S AFFIRMATIVE ACTION JOB RESERVATION SCHEME HAS OUTLIVED ITS UTILITY ESPECIALLY AS INDIA TRIES TO TRANSFORM ITS ECONOMY TO COMPETE WITH COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA BUT ECONOMISTS OF DASHES CONGA PAS DE ARGUES THAT INDIA'S GODDESS PRIORITIES MIXED UP FIFTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS DROP OUT FROM SCHOOL
IN ORDER TO FIND A VISION IN GOVERNMENT JOBS ARE IN HIM OUT INDICATION INSTITUTION IN CHINA MORE THAN NINETY PER OF FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL FORGET ABOUT SECONDARY SCHOOL SO I ONLY DRANK BEFORE THE CHANNEL OTHER POLICIES WITHOUT FOLLOWING THIS ONE
INDIA'S AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN WAS MEANT TO CORRECT HISTORICAL INJUSTICES INSTEAD IT'S TURNED INTO A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT HANDOUT THAT STIFLES RATHER THAN TO STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY GIVING TO DEMANDS TO EXPAND THE SYSTEM WE'RE NOT JUST HURT INDIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH IT COULD ACTUALLY UNRAVEL WHATEVER GAINS IT HAS MADE
THAT WAS ENJOYMENT JUMBO REPORTING FROM WROTE ACNE ME OR DAD IT'S ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER AND A SOUTHAMPTON STUDIO THIS MORNING'S BRIAN DRAPER ASSOCIATE LECTURER AT THE LONDON INSTITUTE FOR CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIANITY MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
IT'S GOOD TO CELEBRATE SUCCESS AND IT WAS LOVELY TO SEE ADELE SO RICHLY REWARDED AT THE BRITS AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT IN A WORLD OF PLASTIC POP STARS SHE STANDS OUT AS A REAL PERSON TALENTED YET HUMBLE AN EXAMPLE FOR MY OWN DAUGHTER'S HOPEFULLY TO ASPIRE TO
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT AWARD CEREMONIES OF ANY KIND MAKE ME SQUIRM BECAUSE WHILE THERE ARE ALWAYS A HANDFUL OF WINNERS AND SOME OF THEM LIKE ADELE I WORTHY THE REST BY ASSOCIATION BECOME LOSERS
IT REMINDS ME OF THAT SINKING FEELING YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE IN WITH A CHANCE OF WINNING ANYTHING AND YOU MISS OUT I THOUGHT I HAD A CHANCE TO WIN OUR CLUBS YOUNG CRICKETER OF THE YEAR AWARD AT FIFTEEN AND THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T CONFIRM TO ME I WAS JUST A TEENAGE LOSER
COME SUNDAY NIGHT WITH THE OSCARS THAT HABIT OF TRAINING CAMERAS ON ALL THE NOMINEES THEN HOLDING THE GAZE ON THOSE WHO HAVEN'T WON SEEMS ESPECIALLY CRUEL
EVEN THEN AT LEAST THEY'RE IN THE FRAME IT SEEMS ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FILM INDUSTRY THIS YEAR HAVE ALREADY LOST IN A SYSTEM THAT AS WE'VE SEEN COULD BE DANGEROUSLY AND CRUELLY SUBJECT TO HUMAN PARTIALITY
THE QUESTION I SUPPOSE IS HOW MUCH WE VALUE ANY KIND OF EXTERNAL RECOGNITION WHICH CREATES WINNERS AND LOSERS AND MOSTLY LOSERS OF US ALL THERE'S SOME MERIT IN IT I SUPPOSE IT CAN INSPIRE US TO GREATER THINGS REWARD TALENT RECOGNISE THOSE WHO'VE REACHED THE TOP BUT THERE IS MORE TO A LIFE'S WORK THAN MERE COMPETITION
YOU'D LIKE TO THINK RELIGION COULD SHOW US A RICHER WAY TO GO HERE IT'S CERTAINLY ADDRESSES DEEP A NEED FOR RECOGNITION AND INTRINSIC WORTH
BUT IT'S ALSO SUBJECT TO OUR HUMAN WEAKNESS FOR TURNING PEOPLE INTO WINNERS AND LOSERS AND WE CAN END UP PRETTY QUICKLY WITH THE UNGENEROUS BELIEF THAT THE RIGHTEOUS FEW WILL WIN AND GET THE GLORY WHILE THE REST CAN GO TO HELL
STILL THERE'S A HIDDEN PEARL THAT LIES AT THE HEART OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH IS GRACE GRACE IS HARD FOR EVEN PEOPLE OF FAITH TO GET THEIR HEADS ROUND I THINK PRECISELY BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT WE CANNOT WIN GOD'S FAVOUR
AT ALL WE CAN ONLY RECEIVE IT FREELY BECAUSE IT IS GIVEN FREELY
GRACE AND DOESN'T JUST CHANGE THE RULES BUT THE GAME THERE ARE NO WINNERS OR LOSERS
AND FOR ANY OF US RELIGIOUS OR NOT WHEN IT COMES TO THE SO CALLED GAME OF LIFE WHETHER WE MAKE MUSIC OR FILMS OR DO ANYTHING SOULFULLY CREATIVE IT CAN BE LIBERATING IF RATHER THAN TRYING TO WIN FAVOUR FROM OTHERS FOR WHAT WE DO WE AIM TO SERVE AND INSPIRE THEM WITH OUR GIFTS AND TALENTS INSTEAD
AND WE'VE NOTHING TO LOSE WITH THAT
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BRIAN DRAPER ASSOCIATE LECTURER AT THE LONDON INSTITUTE FOR CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIANITY TIME WAS EIGHT MINUTES TO EAT HERE IS A REASON TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SCIENCE IN PARTICULAR THE FUNDING OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT COMES FROM THE E.U. AND WOULD DRY UP IF WE LEFT LEAVING US IMPOVERISHED PHYSICALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY THE MAN MAKING THAT CASE HIS NOBEL PRIZE WINNER HEAD OF THE FRANCIS CRICK INSTITUTE PROFESSOR SIR PAUL NURSE
RANGED AGAINST HIM ARE WELL OTHER SCIENTISTS WHO BELIEVE EQUALLY PASSIONATELY THAT WE COULD DO PERFECTLY WELL WITH OUR SCIENCE ESTABLISHMENT SEPARATED FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION INDEED IT'S ONLY A FEW YEARS SINCE SEVERAL OF THEM ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT WAS HAVING ON STEM CELL RESEARCH PROFESSOR SIR PAUL IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING CAN WE TALK FUNDING FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT'S OBVIOUSLY HUGELY IMPORTANT WE DO GET A FAIR BIT OF FUNDING FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION
BUT IF WE WERE NOT TO BE PAYING OUR MONEY TO THE EUROPEAN UNION WE COULD SPEND SOME OF THAT I'M FUNDING OR MAKE UP ANY SHORTFALL COULDN'T
WE COULD OF COURSE BUT PERHAPS I SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT IN THE U.K. WE SPEND POINT FOUR NINE PER CENT OF OUR G.D.P. ON SCIENCE THE AVERAGE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION'S POINT SIX SEVEN PER CENT SO I DON'T SEE ACTUALLY HUGE APPETITE AT THE MOMENT IN MATCHING EVENING THE SPENDING IN THE Y. UNIT IT WOULD BE A DECISION AND YOU COULD MAKE THE CASE FOR IT THAN WE DO CONTRIBUTE DON'T WE WE CONTRIBUTE TO WORD I THINK ROUGHLY FIVE BILLION POUNDS TOWARDS
THE EUROPEAN UNION'S RESEARCH FUNDING AND THEN WE GET A BIT MORE THAN THAT QUITE A LOT MORE EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION BACK SO WE COULD SIMPLY FUND THAT SHOP FOR COULDN'T WE OF COURSE WE COULD BUT REALLY THIS ISN'T SUCH A FOCUS ON FUNDING TO BE QUITE HONEST COMING OUT OF THE E.U. IS A BIGGER PROBLEM BECAUSE WE REMOVE OURSELVES
FROM THE E.U. IT'S A SCIENCE POWERHOUSE IT'S EQUIVALENT TO THE U.S. IT'S EQUIVALENT TO CHINA AND WE NEED TO BE PART OF THAT POWER HOUSE BEING IN THE E.U. GIVES US A READY ACCESS TO THE BRIGHTEST PEOPLE IN EUROPE IDEAS INVESTMENT THAT WE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND TECHNOLOGIES MORE THAN THAT THE COMBINED STRENGTH OF THE SCIENCE ACTS AS A MAGNET
FOR ATTRACTING OTHER SCIENCE FROM ACROSS THE WORLD THESE ISSUES THAT PAT'S GET LOST IN THIS DEBATE AND ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE ALL RIGHT IF IF THAT IS THE IMPORTANT THING THEN WHAT ABOUT US WHAT ABOUT THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY WHAT ABOUT THE YOU REEK A NETWORK THE NETWORK FOR INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WHAT ABOUT THE EUROPEAN CO OPERATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FRAMEWORK ALL OF THESE FRAMEWORKS
OUTSIDE THE E.U. IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE THE Y. YOU CAN CAN READILY JOIN THE WE CAN REMAIN IN THEM WE CAN REMAIN IN THOSE BUT THERE'S MANY THINGS WE CAN'T REMAIN IN WE HAD THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH AREA WHICH IS ENTIRELY AROUND THE E.U. IF WE WEREN'T PART OF THE E.U. WE WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL SWITZERLAND TRYING TO BUY ITSELF IN ITS NOW I'VE BEEN REJECTED BECAUSE INTERNAL
POLITICS OF REDUCED MOBILITY THERE OUTSIDE IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE EUROPE YOU DON'T INFLUENCE THE AGENDA AND I SUPPOSE THE POINT IS WE'RE STILL IN QUITE A FEW OF THE BIG
BODIES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE PART OF AND THE IDEA THAT LEAVING THE OPINION HE SOMEHOW REMOVES US FROM EUROPEAN SITES JUST ISN'T TRUE IT ISN'T TRUE BUT WHAT IS TRUE IS THAT WE'RE PUTTING BARRIERS IN PLACE WE INCREASE INCREASE BAROQUE CRECY BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO COLLABORATE WITH PEOPLE OVER CLINICAL TRIALS AND SAWN WE HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION UNION FRAMEWORK
ALL OF THAT IS MADE MUCH MUCH MORE DIFFICULT YOU MENTION BUREAUCRACY ON THE CLINICAL TRIAL THAT'S DIRECT IT IT'S GOVERNMENTS TO AN EXTENT THE WAY THAT ALL CREDIT CLINICAL TRIALS ARE DONE IN A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE THOSE RULES WHICH COME FROM EUROPE ARE TOO BUREAUCRATIC SLOW DOWN THE CREATION OF NEW DRUGS TO CURE TERRIBLE DISEASES TO QUOTE MICHAEL GO WRITING THE SPECTATOR RECENTLY THAT ACTUALLY THERE IS A DEAL OF BUREAUCRACY FROM EUROPE
THAT WE COULD DO WITHOUT YOU KNOW IT'S A NAIVE THIS APPROACH WE HAVE TO WORK WITH EUROPE IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE STRENGTH IN CLINICAL TRIALS TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IT'S MICHAEL GO IF WE ARE WRONG HE'S WRONG ABOUT OF IT'S NOT THAT THERE ISN'T THE ROCKER SEE THERE WE HAVE PLENTY OF BUREAUCRACY IN THE U.K. OVER THIS THESE MATTERS I FIGHT IT MYSELF IF WE WANT TO REALLY MAKE SCIENCE WORK
WE HAVE TO BE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WE HAVE TO INFLUENCE THE AGENDA WE HAVE TO MAKE THE REGULATION ON THE CAME OUT OF FRIED INTO IT IS A FACT ISN'T IT THAT WE ARE LESS FREE TO DO THE TRIALS THAT WE WANT TO DO IN THE WAY THAT WE WANT TO DO THEM THEN WE WOULD BE IF WE WERE OUTSIDE THE OPINION
YES BUT WE HADN'T MUCH MUCH LESS INFLUENCE OUR WORK WILL HAVE MUCH LESS IMPACT IS NAIVE AND FRANKLY WHY INTELLECTUAL LAZY AND IT'S I DON'T ARGUE LIQUOR HERE INTO IT'S NOT I MEAN PEOPLE WILL EITHER TAKE IT SERIOUSLY OR THEY WON'T KNOW I'M BRING ON THE QUALITY OF THE WORK SURELY NOT WHETHER OR NOT WEAR PART OF SOME CLAY TOO SMALL
TO BE EFFECTIVE WE AREN'T TOO SMALL WE ARE AN ISLAND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE AN ISLAND IN SCIENCE IF WE ARE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WE ARE PART OF A POWER HOUSE THAT CAN PRODUCE THE DATA WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THEM AND WILL HAVE NO IMPACT OF WHERE OUTSIDE IT WILL MAKE IT WORSE IT'S NAIVE THIS AGAIN THEIR RESTRICTIONS YOU THINK OF STEM CELLS THAT COURT CASE BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN FOR THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE THAT RESTRICTED STEM CELLS THEY SAID YOU CAN'T PATENT STEM CELL TECHNOLOGY IS USE HUMAN EMBRYOS FOR
RESEARCH A LOT OF SCIENTISTS THEN SAYING THAT THAT REDUCED THE ABILITY OF BRITISH SCIENTIST TO DO STEM CELL RESEARCH THERE WOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES AT LEAST WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT BUT ED THERE WOULD BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES WHERE BRITISH SCIENCE COULD DO BETTER OUTSIDE LOOK IN THE U.K. LOOK SCOTLAND AND WALES
VOTED AGAINST USING STONE USING G.M. FOR EXAMPLE IT ISN'T ALL ONE WAY WE HAVE TO INFLUENCE THIS POWER HOUSE AND WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A VISION YOU KNOW MOVING AWAY JUST BEARING ON HEAD IN THE SAND IT LACKS AMBITION IS SIMPLY THE WRONG MESSAGE TO GIVE TO OUR YOUNG SCIENTISTS ACTUALLY YOUNG PEOPLE MORE GENERALLY WE
THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THIS IS IT'S NEGATIVE IT'S BURYING HER HEAD IN THE SAND IT'S BACKWARD LOOKING THERE ARE REAL OPPORTUNITIES HERE WE NEED THE AMBITION TO SUCCEED WE WILL SUCCEED BETTER WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION RATHER THAN TURNING OUR BACK ON THE EUROPEAN UNION OVER SCIENCE COS IF WE DO THEY WILL TURN THEIR BACK OVER US I'M GONNA STOP YOU THERE PROFESSOR THANK YOU

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF FEBRUARY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING A CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA WHICH CAME INTO EFFECT LAST NIGHT APPEARS TO BE LARGELY HOLDING BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID THERE WON'T BE A SECOND E.U. REFERENDUM EVEN IF THE U.K. VOTES TO LEAVE EXIT POLLS FROM THE IRISH GENERAL ELECTION SUGGEST THE RULING COALITION WILL LOSE POWER AND TWO FORMER CONTESTANTS ON THE VOICE HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO REPRESENT THE U.K. AT THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST THE B.B.C. NEWS READ THIS MORNING BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THERE'S BEEN A LULL IN THE FIGHTING OVERNIGHT IN SYRIA AFTER THE START OF A TEMPORARY TRUCE DRAWN UP BY RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES THE FRONT LINES IN THE CITIES OF ALEPPO AND DAMASCUS ARE REPORTED TO BE CALM THE STATE MEDIA SAID TWO PEOPLE DIED IN AN EXPLOSION IN THE PROVINCE OF HAMMER AND A REBEL GROUP CAME THREE OF ITS FIGHTERS WERE KILLED IN THE ATTACK IT A PROVINCE A CORRESPONDENT OWEN IS FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS FROM NEIGHBOURING TURKEY

ISLAMIC STATE GROUP THE ALQAEDA LINKED A LIST FOR A FRONT AREN'T PART OF THE DEAL SO ATTACKS AGAINST THEM WILL CONTINUE
BUT THE AIM NOW IS TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF TO BESIEGED AREAS AND TO BRING THE DIFFERENT PLAYERS RUSSIA THE WESTERN LED COALITION THE ASAD REGIME AND THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION BACK TO THE TABLE FOR TALKS SCHEDULED FOR THE SEVENTH MARCH
IN THE RUN UP TO THE TRUTH THERE WERE HEAVY ATTACKS AROUND DAMASCUS AND ALEPPO BLAMED ON RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES BUT DENIED BY MOSCOW
THE KREMLIN SAYS IT WILL CONTINUE TO HIT TERRORISTS WITH A CEASEFIRE HOLDS WILL DEPEND ON HOW RUSSIA DEFINES THAT GROUP UNTIL NOW IT HAS ALSO USED TO REFER TO THE WESTERN BACKED OPPOSITION
EVEN IF THE CESSATION REMAINS IN PLACE THERE IS STILL NO LONG TERM PLAN FOR HOW TO END THIS WAR AND KEEP SYRIA TOGETHER

SUCH IS THE COMPLEXITY OF IRELAND'S VOTING SYSTEM THAT THE COUNT IS CONDUCTED THE DAY AFTER THE VOTE ITSELF THAT SYSTEM ALSO MAKES PREDICTING THE WINNER PRETTY TRICKY BUT THE LOSERS ARE EASIER TO IDENTIFY LABOUR THE JUNIOR PARTY IN THE COALITION THAT HAS TAKEN IRELAND THROUGH SOME VERY HARD YEARS OF AUSTERITY LOOKS SET TO BE TROUNCED THE GALE THE BIGGEST PARTY IN THE DOLL ALSO LOOKS AS IF IT WILL TAKE A BEATING
SINN FEIN ONCE THE POLITICAL WING OF THE I.R.A. BUT IN THE REPUBLIC A PARTY THAT'S POSITIONED ITSELF ON THE LEFT MAY WELL END UP AS THE THIRD LARGEST PARTY NO MAINSTREAM PARTY WILL ALLY WITH SINN FEIN
THE TWO BIGGEST PARTIES FEENA GALE AND FEEL HER FOUR HAVE BEEN RIVALS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR A COALITION BETWEEN THEM SEEMS UNTHINKABLE WITHOUT ONE FORMING A GOVERNMENT MAYBE IMPOSSIBLE

AFTER GIVING EVIDENCE TO THE INQUIRY INTO SEX ABUSE AT THE CORPORATION HAS CLAIMED HE WAS OFFERED THE CHANCE TO RESIGN AND RETURN TO WORK LATER IN HER REVIEW PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY DAME JANET SMITH CONCLUDED THAT MISTER BLACKBURN HAD BEEN QUESTIONED BY THE B. B. C. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE ABOUT A COMPLAINT BY A TEENAGE GIRL THE D.J. INSISTS HE WAS NOT
THE B.B.C. DIRECTOR GENERAL LORD HALL SAID HIS EVIDENCE TO THE INQUIRY HAD FALLEN SHORT OF THE STANDARDS EXPECTED MY BLACKBURN STRENUOUSLY DENIES WRONGDOING IN HIS ONLY BROADCAST INTERVIEW SINCE LEAVING THE CORPORATION HE SAYS THE B. B. C. SACKED HIM AFTER HE REFUSED TO STAND DOWN
THEY GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO RESIGN WITH THE SAYING THAT IT THAT WHERE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY CUT OF ALL TIMES WILL BE B. C. AND WE COULD PROBABLY BRING YOU BACK IN A FEW MONTHS I DON'T THINK PEOPLE KNEW THAT BUT I SAID NO I WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I'VE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE
THE B. B. C. SAID IT WOULD NOT COMMENT FURTHER YOU CAN HEAR THAT INTERVIEW IN FULL ON BROADCASTING HOUSE HERE ON RADIO FOUR FROM NINE A.M. TOMORROW
THE PRODUCER OF JIM'LL FIX IT ROGER AUDACIOUS SAID HE TOLD STAFF ON THE SHOW THAT JIMMY SEVERAL SHOULD NOT BE LEFT ALONE WITH CHILDREN THEN JANET SMITH REVIEW CONCLUDED THAT SENIOR B. B. C. MANAGERS HAD NOT KNOWN OF SERVALS ABUSE MY ORDERS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT HE HAD NOT BELIEVED SEVERAL MIGHT HARM CHILDREN HERE'S TOM BATEMAN
ROGER OLDISH DISH PRODUCED JIM'LL FIX IT FOR ITS WHOLE NINETEEN YEAR RUN A REPORT THIS WEEK BY DAME JANET SMITH SAID THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE HE WAS PARTY TO CONCERNS ABOUT SAMPLES CHARACTER IT NOTED THERE BY THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AN INFORMAL PRACTICE HAD GROWN AMONG SOME OF THE SHOWS STAFF OF TRYING TO SHIELD YOUNG PEOPLE FROM THE PRESENTER
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THIS PROGRAMME MY ALL SAYS HE DOES REMEMBER TELLING STAFF THAT SAMPLE SHOULD NOT BE LEFT ALONE WITH CHILDREN ADDING THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS UNNERVING AND FRIGHTENING FOR SOME YOUNG PEOPLE BUT HE SAID THE ADVICE WAS NOT BASED ON THE FEAR THAT SOMETHING AWFUL MIGHT HAPPEN BUT A RULE THAT CHILDREN SHOULD ALWAYS BE CHAPERONED DAME JANET DESCRIBED MISTER ORTIS AS HONEST AND DECENT SAYING SHE WAS SATISFIED HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF ANY CRIMINAL CONDUCT BY SOUTH
REPORTS FROM VIETNAM SUGGEST THREE BRITISH TOURISTS WHO DIED AT THE WATERFALL WAS SWEPT OVER THE EDGE BY STRONG CURRENTS TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN PAID ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD CHRISTIAN SLOANE AND TO WOMEN NAMED BY FRIENDS AS TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD BETH ANDERSON AND NINETEEN YEAR OLD IZZY SQUIRE
THE FATHER OF A YOUNG CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST WHO APPARENTLY KILLED HIMSELF LAST SEPTEMBER HAS BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT HIS SON'S DEPRESSION EARLIER JOHNSON WHO WAS TWENTY ONE HAD COMPLAINED OF BEING BULLIED BY ANOTHER PARTY WORKER MARK CLARK WHO WAS LATER EXPELLED MY CLERK HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM HE'S JAMES CLAYTON
ALI JOHNSON'S FATHER RAY HAS TOLD NEWSNIGHT BUT HE DECIDED NOT TO REVEAL THAT HIS SON HAD PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE THREE TIMES WHILE HE WAS AT SCHOOL HE TOLD THE PROGRAMME THAT HE HAD NOT DISCLOSED HIS SON'S PREVIOUS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ACCUSATIONS OF BULLYING WOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY WE WERE WORRIED I SUPPOSE
IF WE'D HAVE RAISED THE POINT THAT ELLIOT HAD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES A NUMBER OF YEARS PREVIOUSLY THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET JUSTICE FOR ELLIOT MY JOHNSON STRESS THAT HE BELIEVED ELLIOT SUICIDE ATTEMPTS ARE MORE A CRY FOR HELP THAN A SERIOUS BID TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE
IT HAD BEEN REPORTED THAT ELLIOT JOHNSON BECAME DEPRESSED AFTER COMING OUT AS GAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND HIS FAMILY HAD INITIALLY STRUGGLED TO COME TO TERMS WITH HIS SEXUALITY HOWEVER MY JOHNSON DENIED THIS WAS A FACTOR AND ELLIOT SUICIDE
NEXT WEEK THE CORONER WILL DECIDE THE SCOPE OF THE INQUEST INTO ELLIOTT'S DEATH THAT COULD SEE THE ROLE OF THE TORY PARTY PUT UNDER SCRUTINY

KEITH IT DOYLE REPORTING YOU'RE NOT ALONE MAYBE OR AN ACT OF WISHFUL THINKING WE SHALL SEE IT'S TEN PAST EIGHT THE PLACARDS HAVE BEEN PAINTED THE LEAFLETS PRINTED THE CHANCE REHEARSED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS ARE HEADING TO CENTRAL LONDON THIS MORNING UNITED BEHIND ONE SIMPLE IDEA IT IS TIME
TO STOP TRIDENT THE RENEWAL OF BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR DETERRENT CANNOT THEY BELIEVE BE JUSTIFIED STRATEGICALLY MORALLY OR ECONOMICALLY
THIS PROTEST COMES AT A TIME OF DECISION FOR BOTH THEIR COUNTRY AND WHAT COULD BE OUR NEXT GOVERNMENT MINISTERS ARE POISED TO ORDER THE RENEWAL OF THE TRIDENT SUBMARINE PROGRAMME AND JEREMY CORBIN IS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIS PARTY LABOUR OF COURSE TO EMBRACE HIS LIFELONG EMBRACE OF UNILATERAL
IN A MOMENT WE'LL HEAR FROM HER FORMER LABOUR DEFENCE SECRETARY WHO DISAGREES FIRST THE VIEW FROM THOSE WHO ARE HEADING TO MARBLE ARCH CENSURE BURGERS IN BRISTOL
AND HE'S ABOUT TO BOARD A PROTESTERS BUS MORNING YOU ANJA GOOD MORNING NICK BUT I'M NOT QUITE A BELT TO BOARD THE BUS THOUGH THERE ARE THREE COACHES WAITING TO TAKE
THE BRISTOL PROTESTERS UP TO LONDON AND AMONGST THEM WILL BE BILLED BRADDICK WHO'S A BIT OF A VETERAN OF THESE PROTESTS AREN'T YOU I AM INDEED THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR MANY YEARS
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE TODAY ABOUT THIS PROTEST COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER RECENT ONES CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE NOT JUST FROM SEEING DAY BUT FOR MANY OTHER ORGANISATIONS LOCALLY NATIONALLY
AND FOR US THREE BUSES GOING TO LONDON IS SOMETHING OF A NOVELTY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IT'S BEEN ONLY ONE OR TWO SO WE KNOW WE'VE GOT MORE PEOPLE COMING TODAY THAN WE HAD BEFORE AND YOUR OWN VIEWS WHY ARE YOU HERE
OH I'M HERE TO MAKE THAT I THAT I DO NOT AGREE WITH TIGHTENS AND I DO NOT AGREE WITH REPLACING TITAN AND I CANNOT STAY SILENT WHILE THIS IS GOING ON IN MY NAME SO I'M HERE TO SAY NO
THAT'S A FEW THAT YOU'VE HELD CONSISTENTLY OVER THE YEARS I'VE HELD IT SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER AND I FIRST UNDERSTOOD WHAT NUCLEAR WEAPONS WERE AND I'D NEVER WAVERED FROM THAT AMY LITTLE YOU'RE PART OF THE NEW GENERATION YOU'RE TWENTY EIGHT YOU HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ENGAGED IN PROTEST BEFORE NOW USER NO NOT UNTIL THE RE ELECTION OF THE TORIES TODAY
DO YOU SUPPORT JEREMY CORBIN YEAH ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT HE WAS ELECTED ON A HUGE MANDATE STANDING ON A PLATFORM OR YOU HE'S ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST TRADE AND THE SINGER RIVERA
PEOPLE IN WESTMINSTER THAT WOULD DO WELL TO REMEMBER THAT WHICH IS WHY I WILL BE OUT TODAY WE DO LIVE IN AN INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE WORLD AND FOR A LONG TIME NUCLEAR DETERRENTS AT PEOPLE CREDITED IT WITH KEEPING THE PEACE ISN'T IT A GOOD TIME TO KEEP TRIDENT C. AS THINGS ARE
BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THIS DE PUT THE ISSUES WE FACE TODAY ARE VERY DIFFERENT TO THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN THE COLD WAR
TRIED SIMPLY ISN'T A SECURITY SYSTEM THAT IS IS SUITABLE TO FACING THAT IT'S YOU IT'S COMPLETELY REDUNDANT THESE DAYS WHY ARE YOU HERE
YOU WERE CONSISTENTLY TOLD THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY IN THE POT THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FUND HEALTH CARE OR EDUCATION OR PENSIONS
ALL OF THESE THINGS REALLY DO EQUAL SECURITY FOR PEOPLE YET WHEN IT COMES TO BOMBING SYRIA OR SPENDING ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE BILLION POUNDS ARE RENEWING TRIED AND THE MONEY JUST APPEARS OUT OF THIN AIR IT'S OBSCENE
AMY A LITTLE ANGLE BRADDICK THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NICK SO DO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED I HOPE THEY'LL STAY ON THE LINE AND LISTEN TO THE INTERVIEW WITH LORD HUTTON THE FORMER LABOUR DEFENCE SECRETARY WHO JOINS US NOW MORNING TO YOU LORD HM GOOD MORNING LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION THAT JEREMY CORBIN WAS ASKED WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE BACK IN YOUR OLD JOB INDEED IF YOU WERE PRIME MINISTER BE WILLING TO USE OR THREATENED TO USE BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR DETERRENT
I THINK WE NEED FOR THE DETERRENT TO WORK THEY JUST HAS TO BE A DOUBT IN THE MIND OF ANY POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR THAT WE WOULD USE THAT WEAPON I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE TODAY AND THEY CAN SAY I WOULD OR WOULDN'T PRESS THE BUTTON I THINK THAT'S A RIDICULOUS QUESTION WITH RESPECT BUT I THINK AS FAR AS THE CONCEPT OF DETERRENCE IS CONCERNED AT THE POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR HAS TO BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD AND WE HAVE TO CREATE
THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION AND DEPLOYMENT OF A CREDIBLE DETERRENT SYSTEM BUT THAT BELIEF IS ACTIVE IN HIS MIND THEY HAVE TO GET SOME SENSE THEN OF WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH YOU MIGHT BE WILLING TO THREATEN TO USE IT PEOPLE SAY THE COLD WAR'S OVER SO WHAT POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE COULD YOU WANT TO THREATEN TO USE ME
I THINK WE NEED TO JUST CLEAR AT ONE CONFUSION THAT WE'VE HEARD ON YOUR PROGRAMME TODAY ABOUT THAT THE POINT OF THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT CLEARLY ISN'T A SYSTEM THAT CAN DETER ACTS OF TERRORISM WE KNOW THAT IT WAS NEVER CONCEIVED AS SUCH A SISTER
THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT IS THERE TO PREVENT ANOTHER NUCLEAR STATE EITHER THREATENING TO USE OR USING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGAINST THE U.K. OR A INTERNATIONAL ALLIES IN NATO AND I THINK IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN EVIDENCE BASED REVIEW OF OUR DEFENCE AND SECURITY POLICY WHICH IS IS WHAT THE LABOUR PARTY WANTS AND I FULLY SUPPORT
WE SHOULD TRUST THE EVIDENCE AND LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE AND I THINK IT HAS WORKED THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT HAS PREVENTED ANY ACTIVE NUCLEAR AGGRESSION AGAINST THE U.K. OR A NATO PARTNERS SO IN SIMPLE TERMS YOUR EXCEPTION POTENTIAL AGGRESSORS IF YOU USE THEM OR THREATEN TO USE THEM WE WOULD THREATEN TO USE THEM TO GIVEN THAT IT WAS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS GIVE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES DONE DO AS WELL THEY ARE ISN'T OUR OWN DETERRENT AT BEST IRRELEVANT AND AT WORST DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT IRRELEVANT AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T ISN'T DANGEROUS THAT COMMAND OR CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS AROUND THE SURVEY THAT ATTACKED HER VERY CLEAR AND VERY ROBUST AND I THINK IT'S ANOTHER FACTOR IN THE MIND OF ANY POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR THAT WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT DETERRENT WHICH IS SUBJECT TO EXCLUSIVE YOU TAKE CONTROL YOU SAY IT'S NOT A LOT WE HAD WILLIAM PERRY ON THE FORMER U.S. DEFENCE SECRETARY OR REMEMBER HIM WELL I'M SURE IN A BOOK SAYING CLOSE TO THE NUCLEAR BRINK IN DESCRIBING THREE INCIDENTS
IN WHICH HE SAID WE WERE MIGHTILY CLOSE TO NUCLEAR CONFRONTATION CONFLAGRATION BY MISTAKE I WILL I MEANT IT WHEN I SAID THAT NOT DANGEROUS NICKER I MEANT THERE ISN'T ANY SORT OF RISK OF THAT OF THE WEAPON SYSTEM ITSELF BECOMING UNSTABLE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT OF COURSE THE WEAPONS THEMSELVES ARE INHERENTLY GHASTLY AND I THINK WE HAVE TO REALISE THAT AND THAT'S WHY THE LAST LABOUR GOVERNMENT TOOK STEPS TO REDUCE THE U.K.'S NUCLEAR
ARSENAL I THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GET TO A NUCLEAR FREE WORLD WHICH IS VERY MUCH WHAT I WANT TO SEE BUT I THINK THE ONE LESSON FROM HISTORY WE SHOULD BE VERY AWARE OF AND IN THERE'S ACTUALLY NO PROSPECT WHATSOEVER OF ANY UNILATERAL ACT FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND GIVING UP ITS NUCLEAR DETERRENT HAVING ANY IMPACT WHATSOEVER ON ANY OF THE OTHER NUCLEAR STATE
AND I THINK IF WE WANT ANY KIND OF LIVERISH IF YOU WANT ANY KIND OF INFLUENCE IF WE ULTIMATELY WANT TO KEEP THE COUNTRY SAFE SECURE AND TAKING A UNILATERAL ROUTE TO DISARMAMENT WOULD BE A COMPLETELY STUPID THING TO DO
AND YET THERE ARE PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN PART INDEED THE SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY IS NOW SAYING THAT'S TRIDENT WILL BECOME IRRELEVANT FOR ANOTHER REASON THAT DRONES FOR EXAMPLE WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT SUBMARINES THE VERY IDEA OF THEM THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS UNDETECTABLE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WILL BE SHORTLY PROVED TO BE WRONG
WELL I'D BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT HER SOURCE OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IS COS IT CERTAINLY AT ODDS WITH ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION I SAW WHEN I WAS IN GOVERNMENT AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TECHNOLOGY SITUATION TO BE NOW IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT A POTENTIAL AGGRESSORS AREN'T INVESTING IN COUNTERMEASURES ACROSS THE CAN WE INVENT INVEST IN COUNTER COUNTERMEASURES
AND SO IT GOES ON I THINK THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING THAT THIS IS SIMPLY THIS THAT THE RUSSIANS CHINESE AMERICANS ARE ALL INVESTING SIGNIFICANT IN THIS AREA I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REAL CONSENSUS OR ANY EVIDENCE THAT I'VE SEEN THAT MAKES THEM MAKES ME THINK THAT THE NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM IS IS NOW SOMEHOW UNIQUELY
IRRELEVANT OR HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO COUNTER COUNTERMEASURES FROM NEW TECHNOLOGY LIKE THE RATHER MORE LIVELY LANGUAGE IN AN ARTICLE RECENTLY TIRED OLD SCIENCE FICTION YOU ACCUSED YOU'RE FRUSTRATED IS IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE HISTORY THE P.N.C. WHAT A FASCINATING HISTORY OF THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT RECENTLY AND IN A PEOPLE IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WERE PREDICTING THE THE ADVENT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD RENDER BALLISTIC SUBMARINES REDUNDANT NOW WE'RE SIXTY FIVE YEARS ON FROM THEN THERE'S NO SIGN OF THAT TECHNOLOGY EMERGING SO I THINK I'M PERFECTLY JUSTIFIED
AS GEORGE ROBERTSON WAS TO TO USE THE EXPRESSION SCIENCE FICTION TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THESE ARGUMENTS THAT REALLY ARE AT BEST ONLY CAMOUFLAGE FOR THOSE WHO REALLY WANT TO EXPEL US UNILATERAL SOME IF THEY WANT TO IT ESPOUSE YOU HAVE SOME FINE I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE MORAL ARGH IN BEHIND THAT I DON'T HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH IT I THINK HE WOULD EXPOSE BRITAIN TO UNNECESSARY AND UNREASONABLE RISK BUT DON'T HIDE BEHIND THESE RIDICULOUS ASSERTIONS THAT THERE ARE SOME NOW
SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT RENDERS THE BALLISTIC SUBMARINE CONCEPT AS A REDUNDANT THERE ISN'T SOME TIMES ARE SEEN THROUGH THE PRISM OF AS IT WERE YOUR WE HAVE A PARTY VERSES THE BLAIRITE WHERE YOU GET YOUR WING THE BLAIRITE WING AGAINST AS IT WERE THE LEFT YOU TAKE NOVA AND YET ACQUIT YOU CHARLES CLARKE FRIEND IF IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO SAID TRIDENT IS AN EXPENSIVE WEAPON SYSTEM DEVELOPED IN THE COLD WAR TO MEET THE CONDITIONS OF THE COLD WAR WE HAVE TO TAKE ON SECURITY DECISIONS ON THE BASIS OF WHAT ARE LIKELY TO BE THE THREAT IN THE FUTURE
THAT'S I DISAGREE WE TALKED ABOUT THAT BY THE WAY AND I THINK THAT QUOTE IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY A SORT OF PLAYWRIGHTS WING AGAINST ANYONE ELSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT VIEWS NOT ONLY IN THE IN THE LABOUR PARTY TODAY BUT IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO SOME FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL PORTILLO NO LONGER BELIEVES WE SHOULD SUPPORT THE NUCLEAR DETERRENT SO THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN NICK AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THIS BUT THE OTHER REASON WHY I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO TO RENEW THE SUBMARINE PROGRAMME
IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO LAST FIFTY FIFTY YEARS I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE ALIVE TODAY WHO CAN TELL US WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY SITUATION IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE FIFTY YEARS FROM
WHO ARE THEY AND WHAT HOW WHAT IS THEIR SOURCE OF INFORMATION SO LET'S JUST KEEP THIS ULTIMATE INSURANCE POLICY IN OUR BACK POCKET LORD HUNT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED A VERY BRIEF LAST WORD WE'RE GOING TO GIVE TO AMY WHO'S WAITING TO COME ON A BUS YOU STILL COMING ARE YOU AMY DESPITE LISTENING TO THAT
I AM YES DEFINITELY NOT CONVINCED O.K.
IT AS SEEN FROM YOU AND JUST THERE'S INCONSISTENCIES WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT FOREIGN SECRETARY SAY ONE THING AND DEFENCE SECRETARY SAYING ANOTHER THING THE POINT IS THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO PRESS THAT BUTTON AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T WORK AS A DETERRENT
WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN JOBS WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN HOMES AND EDUCATION THESE ARE THAT IS SECURITY IS IT'S NOT A WEAPON OF MASS JUST CUT
AMY A LITTLE BILL BRADDICK THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED OF COURSE WERE LISTENING NOT TO THE DEFENCE SECRETARY FOR THE FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY JOHN HUTTON ALTER THE TIME TWENTY PAST EIGHT IT'S NOT JUST WHAT CANDIDATES SAY IN THE U.S. CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IT IS ALSO THE MUSICAL SOUNDTRACK THAT ACCOMPANIES THEM BILL CLINTON SHOWED THAT NINETEEN NINETY TWO HE USED TO FLEETWOOD MAC'S DON'T STOP THINKING ABOUT TOMORROW
VERY SUCCESSFULLY WITH THAT SONG SIGNALLED A GENERATIONAL SHIFT DURING THE CURRENT CAMPAIGN DONALD TRUMP AS I GOT INTO TROUBLE PLAYING ADELE SONGS AGAINST HER WISHES
BERNIE SANDERS THE CHALLENGER CLINTON ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE THIS TIME ROUND A SCORED A HIT WITH SIMON AND GARFUNKEL ZE BALLAD AMERICA OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT HAS BEEN LISTENING TO WELL ALL OF THIS YEAR'S MUSICAL OFFERINGS OLD AND NEW AND SOME FROM THE VERY DISTANT PAST
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER WITH THE MOST OBVIOUS LYRIC IN U.S. POLITICAL HISTORY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES A TIME WHEN MASS MERCHANDISING WAS TAKING HOLD CAMPAIGN SONGS DOUBLED AS ADVERTISING JINGLES AND THE CANDIDATE SOUNDTRACKS DIDN'T JUST COME OFF THE SHELF THAT WERE TAILORED INDIVIDUALLY
CALLING JACK NAN WAS QUITE SO STYLISHLY CUSTOM MADE AS FRANK SINATRA SONG FOR JACK KENNEDY IN NINETEEN SIXTY A MALTED IS HERE I HOPE TO HELP HIS FELLOW DEMOCRAT AND FELLOW PLAYBOY
GRUBER WAS HANDED TO A NEW GENERATION IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
THE VOTING AGE IN AMERICA WAS LOWER TO EIGHTEEN AND THE MUSIC BECAME MORE EDGY OR MORE
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR RONALD REAGAN USED BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S MOST FAMOUS ANTHEM AND EVEN THOUGH THE SONG WAS A DIATRIBE AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S TREATMENT FOR VIETNAM VETS IT AROUSE PATRIOTIC EMOTIONS
THAT AMERICAN POLITICIANS HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO STIR CAMPION SONGS HAVE BEEN WITH US AND ONE VARIETY OR ANOTHER GOOD DATING BACK TO GEORGE WASHINGTON PROFESSOR ERIC CASPER HAS WRITTEN THE BOOK LITERALLY ON CAMPAIGN MUSIC A GOOD CAMPAIGN SONG WILL BE ONE REINFORCES THE MESSAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN
PUMP UP THE CROWD AND THEN FINALLY IT DOESN'T DRY AWAY FROM THE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF COPYRIGHT PERMISSION OR HER BECAUSE THERE IS IN A PROPER IMPLIED ENDORSEMENT ABOUT SUPPORT OF THE CANDIDATE BY THE MUSICAL OR
THIS YEAR HILLARY CLINTON SONGS HAVE SERVED AS MOOD MUSIC OF THE CAMPAIGN WHEN SHE RELEASED HER OFFICIAL PLAYLIST LAST YEAR WHEN THE RACE LOOK LIKE A CORONATION SHE STARTED WITH HAPPY PAROLE WILL YOU
YOU KNOW WITH HER WHEN SHE STARTED FACING AN UNEXPECTED CHALLENGE FROM BERNIE SANDERS HE TURNED TO FIGHT SONG BY RACHEL PLAN
IN THE MESSAGE CHANGES WHEN THEY WANT A DIFFERENT IMAGE IN THE CANDIDATE FRONT AND CENTRE
THE SONG BECAUSE ONE OF THE FIRST WAYS TO DO THAT IT CAN BE DONE VERY SUCCINCTLY YOU CAN REACH YOU IN THIS MEDIUM OF MUSIC WITH THAT EMOTIONAL POWER AS THE CAMPAIGN HAS NEEDED TO CHANGE ITS MESSAGE THE MUSIC CAN HELP MAKE THAT TRANSITION
ALONG WITH A CONTROVERSIAL FARM FROM ADELE DONALD TRUMP PLAYERS THAT HIS RALLIES TWISTED SISTER WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANY MORE AND I HAVE THE TIGER FROM ROCKY
HE CAST HIMSELF AS A PRESIDENTIAL PRIZEFIGHTER READY TO FLATTEN HIS AND AMERICA'S APOLLO
BUT HE'S ALSO A FAN OF PUCCINI THE ENTERS RALLIES TO THE STRAIN
THE MIGHTY CRESCENDO THE MUSICAL MOTIF OF THESE EVER MORE VOLUBLE

COUNTING WILL BEGIN SHORTLY AND ISLANDS GENERAL ELECTION EXIT POLLS HAVE INDICATED THAT THE GOVERNING COALITION IS UNLIKELY TO BE RETURNED TO POWER
THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE IN HER A VIEW OF THE JIMMY SAVILE ABUSES AT THE B. B. C. DAME JANET SMITH SAID SHE WAS TOLD HER FOR SEVENTEEN OCCASIONS OF ABUSE BY SADDLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAMME JIM'LL FIX IT WHICH NINE WERE WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN ONE MAN PRODUCED JIM'LL FIX IT FOR THE WHOLE OF ITS NINETEEN YEAR RUN ROGER AUDITION
MY ROITISH GAVE EVIDENCE TO JANE DAMAGE JANET'S ENQUIRY AND SHE DESCRIBED HIM AS HONEST AND DECENT SHE WAS SATISFIED HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF ANY CRIMINAL CONDUCT BY SADDLE I'VE BEEN TALKING TO ROGER AUDITION ABOUT WORKING LIFE ALONGSIDE JIMMY SAVILE
WHAT I USED TO SAY ABOUT JIMMY HANDLE BEFORE I KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS GHASTLY BUSINESS WAS THAT I KNEW HIM PROBABLY AS WELL AS ANYBODY DID BUT THAT WASN'T VERY WELL BECAUSE HE WAS SUCH A SECRETIVE MAN HE SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE
HIDING THINGS AND RATHER ENJOYING HIDING THEM PROBABLY BUT THAT'S HINDSIGHT DID IT SEEM ODD TO YOU HIS BEHAVIOUR AT THE TIME BUT I WAS FOUND HIS BEHAVIOUR RATHER I WANT BUT YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT YOU'RE NOT SAYING
IS HE'S JIMMY CERULLO A DRUG SMUGGLER HE'S JIMMY SO PAEDOPHILE YOU JUST THINKING THAT'S JIMMY TRAVEL HE WAS A DIFFICULT PERSON TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM WHEN THIS IDEA WAS FIRST PROMOTED BY MY BOSS BILL COTTON
I WENT TO SEE BILL AND SAID I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL IDEA BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF SOMEONE ELSE WERE PRESENTING THE PROGRAMME THAT WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH JIMMY SELLS MORAL BEHAVIOUR IT WAS MY OPINION AND HIS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE
ONE OF THE THINGS DAME JANET SMITH SAYS IS THAT MISTER AUDITION NEW OR WOULD'VE RECOGNISED IF HE'D APPLIED HIS MIND TO IT THERE WAS A FALSITY IN JIMMY SERVALS POSITION ON JIM'LL FIX IT IS IT IS THAT FAIR
A FULL CITY I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT SHE MEANT BY THAT BUT I SUPPOSE WHAT THEN JANET WAS WAS GETTING AT IS IS THAT HE WAS BEING PRESENTED AS SOMETHING THAT HE WAS AND HE WAS BEING PRESENTED AS AS AN AVUNCULAR FIGURE AND IN RETROSPECT THAT WAS A MISTAKE AND THAT WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT WAS AT LEAST POSSIBLE AND INDEED LIKELY TO LEAD TO TO DISASTER
YES HI FEMME AFRAID YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT I MEAN HE DID OPEN HIS SAY I HATE CHILDREN BUT DID YOU SAY THAT TO YOU
YEAH BUT HIM WHEN HE SAID TO HIM PUBLICLY TAKE TO NEWSPAPERS DID YOU EVER LIKE HIM AT ALL I'LL BE GOT ON WELL YOU KNOW WE WOULD WE WOULD OFTEN HAVE VERY PLEASANT CONVERSATIONS TOGETHER BUT I NEVER FELT
CLOSE TO HIM BECAUSE HE WAS HE BUILT A BARRIER AROUND HIMSELF THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TO APPROACH HIM REALLY IS IT GOING TOO FAR THOUGH TO SAY THAT YOU FELT THAT HE WAS CREEPY THAT HE WAS A POTENTIAL THREAT NOT NECESSARILY A PAEDOPHILE THREAT A RAPIST THREAT THE GOOD HE WAS HE WAS NOT SOMEONE YOU'D WANT VULNERABLE PEOPLE TO BE AROUND YES I THINK THAT'S TRUE
CREEPY BUT NEVER CROSS MY MIND THAT THERE WAS ANY KIND OF PERIOD FAILURE GO
THERE'S A BIT IN JANET'S REPORT WHERE'S SHE SAYS THAT IT APPEARS THAT
PRODUCER WHICH SHE THINKS WAS WAS YOU SHOUTED AT JIMMY SEVERAL BECAUSE HE'D LOCKED HIS DRESSING ROOM DOOR WHEN A GIRL WAS INSIDE AND ASKED IF THE GIRL'S O.K. WHEN SHE LEFT IS IT IS THAT SOMETHING YOU REMEMBER
REMEMBER JANE JANET ASKING ME HURT AM I HONESTLY CANNOT REMEMBER THE OCCASION
COULD IT HAVE HAPPENED DO YOU THINK IT SEEMED UNLIKELY TO ME BUT IT'S POSSIBLE I SUPPOSE I CAN'T SAY IT DIDN'T HAPPEN YOU SEE ANOTHER THING SHE SAYS IS THAT AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE JIM'LL FIX IT GUESS THERE GREW UP AN APPRECIATION THAT SAMPLE PRESENTED A POSSIBLE RISK TO YOUNG PEOPLE SHE SAYS YOU THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOU WERE A PARTY TO THAT CONCERN IS IS IS SHE GOING A BIT FURTHER THAN YOU REMEMBER BEING THE TRUTH WHEN I DO REMEMBER
SAYING THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE LEFT ALONE WITH CHILDREN BUT THAT WOULD APPLY TO THE PRESENTER OF ANY PROGRAMME BECAUSE THAT'D BE RULES AS THEY STOOD THEN WAS THAT THE YOUNG PERSON MUST ALWAYS BE CHAPERONE
BUT IT WASN'T FOR FEAR THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING AWFUL TO THE CHILD BUT I DID THINK THAT HE HIS PRESENCE WAS UNNERVING FOR SOME CHILDREN REALLY YOU REALISE DO YOU COULD SEE THAT THAT SOME CHILDREN FOUND HIM UNPLEASANT TO BE WHERE
FRIGHTENING I THINK YES FOR A PERSON WHO COMMUNICATES WELL WITH CHILDREN SPEAKS ON THEIR LEVEL TO ME HIS APPROACH WAS JUST TO SPEAK DOWN TO THEM OR BE VERY LITTLE TO THEM REALLY
THERE WAS A SECTION OF DANGER AND IT'S REPORTED THE TALKS ABOUT DUBIOUS FIXES ON
JIM'LL FIX IT AND THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR WHERE CONVICTED CHILD ABUSER IS SET UP TO PRETEND AT LEAST TWO TO FIX A MUSIC BOX FOR
FOR A GIRL I MEAN IT IT'S IT'S STRANGE ON ON EVERY LEVEL REALLY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE I DON'T THINK THAT THE ABUSER ABUSED THE GIRL CONCERNED IT DID DO YOU REMEMBER THAT INCIDENT
I DO I DO REMEMBER THAT OF THAT EVENT THAT FIX IT AS WE CALLED IT AND WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT IT WAS IT WAS RIGGED IN ANY WAY
THE FACT THAT THE MAN TURNED OUT TO HAVE BEEN A CONVICTED PAEDOPHILE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY COMPLETE COINCIDENCE BECAUSE I'M SURE EVERYONE WOULD KNOW THAT JIMMY'S I WOULDN'T SAY HEY I HEAR YOU'RE A PAEDOPHILE WELL I'M ONE TOO WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME ON MY PROGRAMME IS IT WOODEN IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK LIKE THAT AND SO I SUPPOSE STATISTICALLY IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A PAEDOPHILE WOULD BE ON THE PROGRAMME WITHOUT US KNOWING THAT'S WHAT HE WAS
IT'S A DAILY IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IS EVIDENCE OF AN NECK A CONSIDERABLE LAX AND IN THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAMME WAS RIGHT NUMBER ONE THAT THERE WERE FIXES FIXES YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT NUMBER TWO THAT THERE WAS SO LITTLE CARE TAKING ABOUT WHO THE CHILDREN WERE PUT IN CONTACT
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO VET EVERY ANY PERSON HAD APPEARED ON THE PROGRAMME TO SEE WHAT THEIR
IF THEY HAD A CRIMINAL RECORD AND WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO THAT IF WE SHOULD HAVE THEN JANET ASKED YOU WHETHER YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN DID OUGHT YOU HAND THE QUESTION OR TO DO IT IN RATHER A DIFFICULT ONE TO ANSWER BECAUSE
WHAT EXACTLY DOES IT MEAN I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING A BIT ODD BUT I DIDN'T BUT I SHOULD HAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE HAD THEIR HAD TO BE DIFFERENT FOR ME TO HAVE THEM IF SOMEONE HAD COME TO ME AND SAID A SPECIFIC THING HAD HAPPENED HER COMPLAINT ABOUT JIMMY SAVILE'S BEHAVIOUR I WOULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND TAKEN THE B.B.C. PROCEDURE
GOING UP THE LINE TO MY MANAGER AND HINT IT IS AND THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HAD KNOWN BUT I DID NOT
AND AT THEIR WAY OF DEMONSTRATING HOW MUCH I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS NOT TURNING A BLIND EYE WAS THAT JIMMY SEVERAL CAME TO STAY IN OUR HOUSE ONE NIGHT AND WE PUT HIM IN THE BEDROOM NEXT DOOR TO MY FOURTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ACT OF A MAN WHO'S TURNING A BLIND EYE
LEONA YOU DID WORK YOU SAID HE DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE HIM ARE YOU DO WORK QUITE CLOSELY WITH THEM FOR QUITE A LONG TIME WHAT WHAT IMPACT HAS THIS HAD ON ON NEW AND ON THE WAY YOU THINK BACK ON YOUR CAREER WITH HIM
I JUST JUST FOR MY SORT OF PERSONAL COMFORT IS HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE SHOCK I KNOW IT'S OF NO SIGNIFICANCE IN COMPARISON WITH THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO THE VICTIMS BUT FROM
IN RETIREMENT PEOPLE SAY WHAT DID YOU DO SO I WAS A B.B.C. TELEVISION PRODUCER WHAT PROGRAMMES DO YOU PRODUCE AND I WOULD SAY OAP JIM'LL FIX IT I DID THAT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND YOU GET A WONDERFUL REACTION OF OWL ENJOYED IT THE CHILDREN LOOK AT ALL THE FAMILY USED TO SIT AND WATCH IT AND NOW IT'S SOMETHING I CAN'T MENTION I JUST
HAVE TO BE ASHAMED OR IT ROGER ORDERS THANKS VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US
ON YESTERDAY'S PROGRAMME WE BROADCAST AN INTERVIEW WITH THE FORMER RADIO ONE D.J. ANDY KERSHAW ABOUT JIMMY SAVILE THAN IN THE INTERVIEW ANDY KERSHAW DISCUSS THE DECISION TO DROP THE NEWSNIGHT INVESTIGATION INTO JIMMY SAVILE AND SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS RELATED TO THE PREPARATION OF TRIBUTE PROGRAMMES FOLLOWING SAMPLES DEATH WE SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE INDEPENDENT POLLARD ENQUIRY COMMISSIONED BY THE B.B.C. EXAMINED THERE'S ALLEGATIONS IN DETAIL NICK POLLARD STATED IN HIS CONCLUSIONS TO THE REPORT
THE DECISION TO DROP THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION WAS FLAWED AND THE WAY IT WAS TAKEN WAS WRONG BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS DONE IN GOOD FAITH IT WAS NOT DONE TO PROTECT THE SADDLE TRIBUTE PROGRAMMES OR FOR ANY IMPROPER RECENTLY ALSO ACCEPTED EVIDENCE GIVEN BY THE OUTGOING DIRECTOR GENERAL MARK THOMPSON THAT HE HAD NO INVOLVEMENT IN THE DECISION
NINETEEN MINUTES TONIGHT NOW PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY ALL IS NOT ENTIRELY QUIET IN SYRIA THIS MORNING A REBEL GROUP IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTH WEST SAID IT CAME UNDER ATTACK AND A CAR BOMB ATTACK HAS KILLED TWO PEOPLE AND HAMMER PROVINCE BUT THE MAIN BATTLE FRONTS DO APPEAR TO HAVE FALLEN SILENT AS A RESULT OF THE TEMPORARY TRUCE THE SO CALLED CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES
BROKERED BY WORLD POWERS BETWEEN SOME OF THE PARTIES CRUCIALLY THAT NOT INCLUDING THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IN BEGAN AT MIDNIGHT LOCAL TIME WE'VE SPOKEN TO TWO PEOPLE INSIDE SYRIA IN AIR IS TOUCHED BY THE CONFLICT FIRSTLY IN ALEPPO THE SCENE OF RECENT FIERCE FIGHTING
HELLO I'M DOCTOR SAD RIGHT NOW I'M NOT THE POSH CITY ELEVEN THIRTY THIS EVENING THERE WAS ABOUT TEN MY EX IN THE WESTERN COUNTRYSIDE IN
THE FIRST HAMBROUGH ALL THOSE CIVILIANS OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT THERE WON'T BE
OR COMMIT THIS IS FIRE BECAUSE WE TRIED THAT YES SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE
THERE WERE JEAN NEVER COMMITS A CEASEFIRE OUR FRIEND GOING TO BE SAT IN HOMS SAID THEY WERE HIT BY ROCKETS AND MUSCLES AT ABOUT THREE A.M. AND OUR FRIENDS IN THAT UP SIT ON SO THAT THEY WERE HEATED BY BY AIR STRIKES SO WE WILL SEE TODAY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
ALTHOUGH THOSE ARE I'M FROM ZORBA DANNY AND I THINK IN MY BY THE TOWN NEXT WAS A CIVILIAN NOW EVERYBODY HIT HIS DOGGY DOUBLE THIS IS FIRE
THEY FEEL THAT THIS IS HOW WILL FALL DOWN AND THE WAR WILL YOU KEEP ON BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS WERE KEEP FIGHTING I'M NOT A FONT UM I'M NOT A FAN OF THIS VERY VERY RESPECTED EVEN THIS WITH THE KINDER BUT THEY RESPECT IT
THE VIEWS FROM ON THE GROUND THERE WERE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY LEADS TO SET OUR CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT AND ON THE LINE BY PETER FORD HE WAS BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO SYRIA UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND SIX MORNING TO YOU BOTH WE HEARD LOTS OF SCEPTICISM THERE LES THEY USE THE WORD CEASEFIRE
YOU NEVER USE THE WORD CEASEFIRE WHY IS THIS LANGUAGE THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND CEASEFIRE IMPORT
I SUPPOSE IF YOU ARE LIVING UNDER BOMBARDMENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGAL NICETIES OF CEASEFIRE CESSATION OF HOSTILITY WANT MATTERED YOU WHAT MATTERS SHE WAS THAT AT THE END OF THIS FIVE YEARS OF PAIN BUT THERE WILL BE AN END TO THIS FIVE YEARS OF PAIN AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T TAKE SERIOUSLY THEY COULD SERIOUSLY UNLESS IT'S REALLY A TRUE EFFORT
LEGALLY SPEAKING IT'S NOT A CEASEFIRE BECAUSE IT HAS WASN'T NEGOTIATED DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE SIDES IT'S NOT A FORMAL CEASEFIRE THERE ARE NO WEATHER MOVES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE PULLING BACK OF HEAVY WEAPONS AND MECHANISM IN WHICH TO ESTABLISH THAT SOMEONE VIOLATED THE CEASEFIRE THE PRESIDENT OBAMA VLADIMIR PUTIN USING CETACEAN OF HOSTILITIES THAT'S THE FORMAL TERM
THE OPPOSITION HAS USED THE WORD TEMPORARY TRUCE IT IS ONLY FOR TWO WEEKS THEY SAID END WE MUST NOTICE AS WITH NINETY SEVEN DIFFERENT FACTIONS THAT SHOULD TELL YOU
IN A WORD IN A NUMBER OF JUST HOW COMPLICATED IT IS THE HOPE IS THAT IT HAS A PRACTICAL AFFECT THE DELIVERY OF SOME AID BUT ALSO THAT IT'S A TEST OF INTENTIONS IS THAT NOT REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT SEEING HOW THE PARTY'S OPERATE AFTER SOME SORT OF DEAL IS BROKEN IF I GET MAYBE THE BEST WAY OF ALL TO DESCRIBE IT BECAUSE AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD THAT IT'S NOT BEEN A COMPLETE CETACEAN OF HOSTILITIES HAS BEEN A CAR BOMB IN HARMER PROBABLY THE WORK OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE WHICH ISN'T PART OF THE CEASEFIRE
AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ATTACKS AGAINST ISLAMIC STATE AGAINST THE OUT ON THIS SHOW BECAUSE IT'S ALLIED TO AL COLLIDER BUT BECAUSE RUSSIA HAS SAID IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE GROUPS ALLIED TO THESE AL CARRIED OUT THAT MEANS OTHER GROUPS WILL ALSO COME UNDER BOMBARDMENT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO SAID THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BOMB DAD I AM WHICH IS A SUBURB OF DAMASCUS AND EVERY TIME I GOT TO DAMASCUS I SEE YOU'VE BEEN POUND IT
BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GROUPS OPERATING THERE INCLUDING THE MODERATE FREE SYRIAN ARMY SO EVERYONE HAS SAID YES WE WILL CEASE HOSTILITIES BUT BUT BUT BUT IT IS A TEST OF INTENTIONS IT IS NOT A LOT BUT IN A WAR THAT HAS BEEN SO PUNISHING
EVEN A LITTLE IS A LOT AT THIS POINT PETER FORD BRITISH MASTER TO SERIES A SAYING FROM TWO THOUSAND THREE TO TWO THOUSAND SIX THE FEAR OF SOME IS IT'S A CESSATION THAT ENTIRELY SUITS TO PARTIES PRESENT A SAD AND HIS BACKER PRESIDENT PUTIN BECAUSE THEY CAN CARRY ON BOMBING YOU THEY CHOOSE WHILE OTHERS CANNOT
NO I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S CORRECT AT ALL AND EARLY SIGNS THAT THE RUSSIANS AND THE SYRIAN ARMY ARE SHOWING RESTRAINT
NOW THE SITUATION IS MESSY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE TWO MAPS THE AMERICAN MAP OF THE BOMBER BOYO AREAS WHICH TOOTH VERY RESTRICTED THE RUSSIAN MAP WITH WHICH IS VERY PERMISSIVE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS GOING TO BE VERY MESSY THERE ARE GOING TO THE
DISPUTES BUT THE AMERICANS WILL ALSO BE SAFE A TEST OF THEIR THEORY
IF THE AMERICANS SHOW RESTRAINT IN CRYING FOUL WHEN THE RUSSIANS OR THE SYRIAN ARMY ATTACK AN AREA WHICH INCLUDES BOTH AND THE FREE SYRIAN ARMY
IF THEY DO THAT THEN THIS AGREEMENT TRUTH GOING COULD COLLAPSE VERY QUICKLY IN OTHER WORDS JUST TO CLARIFY FOR PEOPLE DON'T FOLLOW ALL OF THESE NAMES ALL OF THE JARGON AS IT WERE IF THE RUSSIANS ATTACKED PEOPLE THEY CALL TERRORISTS
BUT THE UNITED STATES AND OTHERS CALLED MODERATE OPPOSITION REBELS TO PRESENT A SAD WERE IN FOR PROBLEMS BUT IT DOESN'T TELL US HOW ABSURD IN A SENSE SOME OF THE IS THERE ARE NO AGREEMENT NO NO NOT THE AGREEMENT IS VERY CLEAR
THE THAT IT'S PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE TO CONTINUE TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM IS THAT MANY OF THE SO CALLED MODERATE
I THINK SAID WORK ALONGSIDE INDEED HAND IN GLOVE WITH THIS COLLIDER AFFILIATE AND IT TELLS US SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRUE MODERATION OF SOME OF THESE GROUPS THAT THEY DO WORK HAND IN GLOVE WITH AND THE THROW
I THINK EVEN THE AMERICAN ACCEPT THAT THEY WANT TO DRIVE SOMETHING OF A WEDGE BETWEEN THE FILLER WHICH WITHOUT AFTER ALL I'LL KINDA
AND THE THE THE THE FOLK CALL MODERATE OPPOSITION OH KAY PETER LET ME BRING ELYSIAN THAT WORRY WE'VE HEARD PARTICULARLY FROM THE UNITED STATES BUT HERE TOO THAT THE RUSSIANS AS THEY DID IN UKRAINE USE SENSATIONS OF HOSTILITY TO REINFORCE THEIR POSITION OF THEIR ALLIES IN THIS CASE PRESIDENT A SAD BEAUTIFUL SCEPTICAL ABOUT THAT WAS THAT NOT WHAT MANY PEOPLE SEE GOING ON
UNFORTUNATES A YEAR TO THE DAY THAT THAT THE RUSSIANS DID THE SAME THING IN UKRAINE WHICH IS WHY THE BRITISH AND OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT IF WE GO BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID THIS IS THIS IS MOST OF ALL A TEST AT MANY SEE IT AS A TEST OF RUSSIA'S INTENTIONS EVER SINCE RUSSIA STARTED BOMBING WAS SEVERAL MONTHS AGO IT HAS TURNED THE TIDE IN FAVOUR OF PRESIDENT ASSAD'S FORCES HIS STRENGTH AND PRESIDENT ASSAD'S FORCES ON KEY FRONT LINES AND IT IS ALSO SHAPED THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS AND MANY WOULD SAY HAS MADE THE STATION OF HOSTILITIES POSSIBLE
PRESIDENT OBAMA WARNED HIM WARNED PRESIDENT PUTIN AND SAID THE WORLD WILL BE WATCHING NOW DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT PUTIN IS SCARED OF THAT MEGA POINTS IN THE SCHOOL YARD IS THAT YOUR SENTIENT THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT A PLAN B. JOHN KERRY HAS WARNED
ABOUT PETITION BUT IT'S NOTICEABLE THAT IN THE RUN UP TO THIS IT WAS VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO WAS MANNING THE TELEPHONE'S COLLING A PRESIDENT ONE CALLING UP ALL THE PLAYERS INVOLVED IN THE CONFLICT
HE DOES HE NOT ONLY WAS THE MAN WHO WANTED TO BE PART OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS WHAT HE CALLED THE VERY IMPORTANT JAZZ HE WANTED TO BE SEEN TO BE PART OF THEM AND PETER CALLED IS THAT IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THAT ANY SETTLEMENT IF THERE IS TO BE ONE DEPENDS ON RUSSIA'S INVOLVEMENT AND ON SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT THERE PROBABLY INVOLVES ASAD STAYING ON FOR SOME TIME ABSOLUTELY GOOD AT THE RUSSIAN STRATEGY IT'S VERY CLEARLY
TO INDUCE THE BREAKAWAY OF THAT LEFT THE EXTREME ELEMENT COULD BE OPPOSITION TO DO SOME KIND OF PACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT
THEN THE GOVERNMENT CAN DEAL WITH THE THE LARGEST REBEL GROUP WHICH YOUTH AND THE FLY AND ISLAMIC STATE BUT I JUST LIKE TO COME BACK TO THE POINT ABOUT POSSIBLE PARTITION
I THINK I I'M NOT SURE THE AMERICAN SERIOUSLY BELIEVED THAT PARTITION THAT I RIPPED A REAL PLAN B.
PARTITION IS WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT THEY FACTO ON THE GROUND THE GOVERNMENT WRIT DOES NOT EXTEND ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTRY
BUT THERE IS A PLAN C. AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE BRAVELY VERY GOOD FANCY EDWIN EDWIN AGAIN THIS IS THE MORE LIKELY PREVAIL IN THIS
PRESENT ARRANGEMENT COLLAPSES WE'RE IN THE LETTER THERE'S A SALOON YEAH THERE IS A THOUGHT BUT JUST BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS VERY BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD LISE SOME PEOPLE LISTENING MIGHT SAY WELL IT'S NOT REALLY A CEASEFIRE AND WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE IT'S GOING TO WORK ON THE EVIDENCE THAT WE SEE FRANKIE DOES IT MATTER
IT DOES MATTER BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AT THE TABLE WHAT OF THE CONFLICT IN THE WORLD HAS VLADIMIR PUTAIN BROCK OBAMA AND ALL THE WORLD'S PLAYERS WITH KEEPING HER EYES ON IF THIS DOESN'T WORK WHAT WILL WORK LOSE HE SAID PETER FORD THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
TIME TENDON I'M QUICK LOOK AT THE PAPERS PLENTY OF REACTION IN THEM TO THE ELECTION OF GIANNI IN FRONT YOU KNOW AS PRESIDENT OF FEE FURTHER PANICLES OF A REMARKABLE COUP FOR THE SWISS LAWYER PUTS THE FACT THAT HE'S PROMISED TO SHARE MORE HER FEVER'S WELFORD NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS THAN HIS RIVAL'S DEB THE GARDAI MONTY FACES AN UPHILL TASK TO OVERHAUL FEVERS REPUTATION FOR CORRUPTION
THE SUN'S OPINION PAGE SAYS FOOTBALL'S GOVERNING BODY HAS BEEN GIVEN A LAST CHANCE THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY DESERVE IT WISHES NEW PRESIDENT GOOD LUCK IN RESTORING FEVERS IMAGE BUT IT REMAINED SCEPTICAL CONCLUDING WILL BELIEVE IT WHEN WE SAY SEVERAL PAPERS INCLUDING THE DAILY STAR HER PICTURES OF A WATERFALL IN VIETNAM WHERE THREE YOUNG BRITISH TOURISTS WERE KILLED BETH ANDERSON AND ISABEL SQUIRE WOULD BEEN KNOWN BY FRIENDS AS TWO OF THOSE WHO DIED ARE PICTURED IN THE EXPRESS SMILING AND STANDING NEXT TO AN ELEPHANT
SEVERAL PAPERS REPORT SUGGESTIONS THE TRIER MAY HAVE HIRED AN UNLICENSED GUIDE AND MAY HAVE BEEN USING THE WRONG EQUIPMENT
GEORGE OSBORNE'S WARNING OF ANOTHER ROUND OF SPENDING CUTS GETS WIDE COVERAGE THE TIME SAYS HE'S BEGUN PREPARING PUBLIC OPINION AHEAD OF NEXT MONTH'S BUDGET AFTER SLOWER THAN EXPECTED GROWTH FINANCIAL TIMES BILLY'S ONE CAUSES I'M USUALLY EXPLICIT COMMENTS SUGGEST THAT U.K. ECONOMIC FORECAST DON'T LOOK GOOD IT ADDS AT THE WORDS WILL SEND SHIVERS DOWN THEIR SPINES ARE SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO FIND ADDITIONAL SAVINGS AFTER YEARS OF DEEP CUTS THE MIRROR POINTS OUT
BUT THE EXTRA CARDS WERE COLOURS M.P.S ARE SENT TO GET A PAY RISE IN A THOUSAND BRANDS ARE STINKING CASE OF DOUBLE STANDARDS RISING NUMBERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN HAVING THEIR DECAYED TEETH PULLED ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH HE PUTS THE FIGURE AT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND LAST YEAR SAYS IT WAS THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIVE AND NINE WERE ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL AN EXPERT TELLS THE TIMES HAD ORAL HEALTH EDUCATION NEEDS URGENT IMPROVEMENT PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THE IMPACT OF SUGAR ON TOOTH DECAY
THE PAPER REPORTS THE WORST AREAS FOR CHILDREN'S DENTAL HEALTH WAS SHEFFIELD FOLLOWED BY DONCASTER ROTHERHAM AND LIVE DRONES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN TWO MORE NEAR MISSES OVER U.K. AIRPORTS ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN THE PAPER SAYS ONE WAS JUST A WING SPAN AWAY FROM HITTING A PASSENGER JET LANDING AT HEATHROW THE OTHER WAS CLOSE TO A TURBOPROP COMMUTER FLIGHT LEAVING MANCHESTER AIRPORT INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO TRACE THE DRAINS OPERATORS
AND THERE ARE FEARS THAT MORE NEAR MISSES ARE GOING UNNOTICED PILOTS' UNION BALPA TELLS THE PAPER WE NEED TO CATCH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THIS BEFORE WE SEE A COLLISION AND LOSS OF LIFE THE DAILY MAIL HAS THE UNLIKELY TALE OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST LOVED CHILDREN'S CHARACTERS THE GRUFFALO MIGHT NEVER HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT
THE EUROPEAN UNION THE BOOK'S GERMAN ILLUSTRATOR AXEL CHEF'LL EXPLAINS HOW HE CAME TO BRITAIN TO STUDY HIS CRAFT UNDER FREE MOVEMENT RULES IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HE SAYS THAT'S HOW HE MET THE BOOK'S AUTHOR JULIA DONALDSON AND IF HE HADN'T THE GRUFFALO IF IT HAD HAPPENED AT ALL
WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BEAST CLINCHING ON O.K. SPATZ WAS GOING TO SAY THAT'S IT THEN SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE NOW IT'S THE OSCARS ON SUNDAY AND TO BE QUITE A SHOCK IF THE REMNANTS STARRING CABRIO DOES NOT WIN BIG IT'S GOT TWELVE NOMINATIONS ONE OF ITS MOST DRAMATIC SCENES INVOLVES THE HERO SURVIVING A BEARER
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT MOMENT IS THAT IT'S FAKE IT USES VISUAL EFFECTS NOT JUST MAN AND BEAR WHICH WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IS NO SURPRISE IS IT BUT IT'S QUITE COMMONPLACE IN HOLLYWOOD NOW FOR ALL SORTS OF EFFECTS TO BE INCORPORATED IN FILMS AND THAT CREATES A NEW CHALLENGE
FOR THE ACTORS HOW DO YOU MESS YOUR PERFORMANCE IN WITH THE EFFECTS IN A WAY THAT'S REALLY PROPERLY CONVINCING WE HAVE A STELLAR CAST TO CONSIDER THIS PAUL FRANKLIN IS THE OSCAR WINNING VISUAL EFFECTS SUPERVISOR ACTUALLY FOUNDED THE COMPANY DOUBLE NEGATIVE VISUAL EFFECTS ONE OF THE BIGGEST VISUAL EFFECTS COMPANIES IN THE WORLD AND ADAM BROWN IS ALSO HIT BRITISH ACTOR WHO PLAYED THE DWARF ORRIE IN THE THREE PART ADAPTATION OF A HOBBIT GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH
FIRST OF ALL PAUL FRANK YOU DIDN'T WORK ON THE REMNANT DID YOU BUT DEDUCT IT WHAT IN THAT BEAR SEEN DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING HOW DID THEY ACTUALLY DO IT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE THAT TO GET LEO TO BE THROWN AROUND BY THE BAT OUT OF WORK WITH THE STUNT CREW SO THEY PUT HIM ON WIRES WOULD HAVE HAD PEOPLE LITERALLY THROWING HIM AROUND
WHO WAS AN ACTOR A STUNT ACTOR DRESSED UP AS A SORT OF FAKE THEY'RE WEARING A BLUE BEAR COSTUMES LEAH'S ACTUALLY GOT SOMETHING TO FIGHT AGAINST AND THEN THAT'LL ALL BE REPLACED DIGITALLY IN POSTPRODUCTION LATER ON WITH A COMPUTER ANIMATED BEAR WHICH IS SO LIFELIKE AND AUTHENTIC THAT IS IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
WHERE WHAT'S REAL AND WHAT'S BEEN CREATED LATER ON BUT THE ACTUAL DOING OF IT ADAM HE'S NOT OF COURSE LIFE LIKE AN AUTHENTIC AND IN FACT IN SOME RESPECTS MIGHT BE KIND OF ODDLY HILARIOUS TO BE DOING ABSOLUTELY YOU'RE FIGHTING WITH A STUNT PERSON IN A GREEN SUIT SO IT IT'S IT'S RIDICULOUS BUT YOU HAVE TO GO WITH IT
IT'S ERM YEAH IT'S IT'S A VERY STRANGE CONCEPT BUT WHAT KIND OF THINGS DID YOU HAVE TO DO ON THE HARBOUR TED GIVE US AN INSIGHT YOU DIDN'T FIGHT WITH A BEAR DID YOU ARE A FAKE BEAR BUT NOW WE HAD GOBLINS AND SPIDERS AND DRAGONS TO DEAL WITH BUT SO PRINCES WITH THE SPIDERS O.K.
DID YOU HAVE TO DO THEY TELL YOU WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE ON THIS ON THE SCREEN DID YOU HAVE TO SORT OF UM DID YOU HAVE TO TO TO ACTS TOWARDS A PARTICULAR DIRECTION HAS IT HAS IT DONE WHAT'S THE DIRECTION IT WAS A MIXTURE REALLY WE HAD
STUNT PEOPLE IN GREEN SUITS FIGHT WITH OR WE WOULD JUST BE FIGHTING AND I REMEMBER CLEARLY ONE DAY SAYING TO PETE PETER JACKSON SAYING WHERE DO I FIRE MY SLING SHOT WHICH WAS MY WEAPON OF CHOICE
AND HE SAID I'LL JUST FIRE ANYWHERE OUT AMONG THE PUT THE SPIDERS IN LATER WHICH REALLY SUPPLY JUST PECK YEAH BUT THAT'S HOW BIG THE PRODUCTION WAS YOU NOWHERE AND WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT HOW THE DECISIONS CAN BE MADE LATER
AFFECTS US IS GIVES THE SEA BASS FOR A DIRECT AT ALL IN THAT RESPECT IN A DIRECT AND SPACE FOR ACTOR AS WELL YES WELL IT KIND OF WORKS BOTH WAYS BECAUSE YOU CAN ALLOW THE ACTOR TO REALLY GET INTO IT AND CREATE SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING AND THEN YOU CAN FIT THE VISUAL EFFECTS THE ANIMATION OF WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE FIGHTING WITH ALL LOOKING OUT TO THE PICTURES AFTERWARDS BUT CAN ALSO COURTS A FEW PROBLEMS IN THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE ALWAYS FACE
IS THAT NOBODY KNOWS QUITE WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK AND SO YOU CAN OFTEN GET SCENES WHERE YOU'VE GOT AN ENSEMBLE SCENE AND EVERYONE'S CONFRONTING THE MONSTER AND THEY'RE ALL LOOKING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND SO YOU'RE TRYING TO THEN RECONCILE THAT ALTOGETHER LATER ON THERE WAS A TELEVISION SHOW I WORKED ON ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO IN WHICH A DEADLY ALIEN MONSTER WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ATTACKING A GROUP OF SOLDIERS AND WRECKING AN ARMY BASE AND ON THE DAY WHEN WE WERE SHOOTING IT
THE STUNT CREW AND SPECIAL EFFECTS CREW HAD SET UP ALL THIS AMAZING WIRE GAGS AND THINGS EXPLODING AND THINGS GOING ON IN THE SET BUT NOBODY CONSULTS WITH A VISUAL EFFECTS CREW AS TO WHERE THIS MONSTER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SIR EVERYTHING JUST WENT OFF SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THEN LATER ON WHEN I WAS TRYING TO ANIMATE THE MONSTER TO THIS MY ONLY SOLUTION WAS TO HAVE THIS THING LEAPING AROUND LIKE A DEMENTED FLEA WHICH SOMEWHAT UNDERMINED IT SORT OF DESTROYING THREAT
DO YOU HAVE IN FRONT WHEN YOU DO IT ADAM DO YOU HAVE A KIND OF A WAY OF ACTING NOW OR DO PEOPLE OTHER ACTORS WHO DO THIS HAVE A BUT HAS THERE HAS THERE AND THEY SETTLED ON A WAY OF DEALING WITH AFFECTS THAT IS THE WAY TO DO IT
ME PERSONALLY I CAME FROM THE THEATRE BACKGROUND AND I MEAN THE COFFEE BUDGET ALONE WOULD FUND HUNDREDS OF THEATRES SHOWS THAT I WAS DOING SO YOU WERE WE WERE ABLE TO
AND AS A THEATRE BACKGROUND THE MAGIC OF THEATRE NURSE PRETEND A TENNIS BALL ON A STICK WAS A GOBLIN AND THE AUDIENCE WOULD GO WITH THAT IF THE ACTOR DID AND I THINK IN THAT RESPECT IT IS VERY SIMILAR
RATHER THAN A BLACK BOX STUDIO THEATRE YOU'RE WORKING YOU'RE WORKING ON A SOUND STAGE WHICH IS GREEN AND IT KIND OF CROSSES OVER YOU BUT IT ISN'T SO MUCH OF A LEAP WHEN YOU THINK OF IT LIKE THAT I SUPPOSE THEM OUT MORE INSIDIOUS FAIR PEOPLE HAVE PAUL WILL BE THAT ACTUALLY THE SPECIAL EFFECTS TAKE OVER IN THE SENSE
THE THINGS THAT THAT THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO SPECIAL EFFECTS AND MAKE THEM LOOK EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE ARE GOING TO BE MORE PRIZED IN THE MAKING OF THE FILM AND THE ACTOR
I THINK THAT IS A GENUINE FEAR BUT I THINK REALLY WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS JUST BAD FILM MAKING THE MY FAVOURITE FILM IS A FILM MADE IN NINETEEN FORTY THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD AND IT FEATURES COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF VISUAL EFFECTS VERY EARLY USE OF BLUE SCREEN IN FACT
BUT WHAT MAKES IT STILL STAND UP IT'S A GREAT PIECE OF FILM MAKING IT TELLS AN INCREDIBLE STORY IT TOTALLY DRAWS YOU IN THE PERFORMANCES ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IN THE FILM AND SO THAT IS THAT IS THE HEART OF IT REALLY IT'S IT'S THE CHOICES THAT THE FILM MAKER ACTUALLY MAKES AND HOW THEY DECIDE TO USE THESE THINGS SOME FILM MAKERS ARE VERY KEEN TO KEEP IT AS REAL AS POSSIBLE I WORK A LOT WITH CHRISTOPHER MOMENT AND WE MADE THE FILM INTERSTELLAR A FEW YEARS AGO
AND ON THAT FILM WE DIDN'T USE ANY GREEN SCREEN AT ALL DESPITE THE FACT THEY WERE FLYING DEEP INTO SPACE WE WANTED TO GAIN THEM FROM DIP IT MEANT THAT THE CAST ACTUALLY HAD SOMETHING TO LOOK AT AND WE CREATED THE IMAGES OF THE BLACK HOLE THE PLANETS AND THINGS AND WE PROJECT THEM OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS OF THE SPACECRAFT SO MATTHEW CONIC MEKON HERE AND ANNE HATHAWAY HAD SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT AND THEY REALLY REALLY LOVE THAT PAUL FRANKLIN AND ADAM BROWN AS WELL THANKS BUT I MISSED THE CHEESE SPECIAL EFFECTS LIKE THE TRIBBLES IN STAR TREK OUR EDITORS TODAY ANDREW BRYSON AND JONATHAN HARVEY THANKS FOR LISTENING
