SARAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SUCCESS TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE BIG STORY FOR MANY OF THEM IS THE PROSPECT OF A TORY REBELLION ON A PART OF THE CHANCELLOR OF THE BUDGET THAT WE HAD THIS WEEK TORY REBELLION GROWS OVER DISABILITY CUTS TOY RIBBON AND WELFARE CUTS IS THE TELEGRAPH HEADLINE IT'S ALL OVER THE FRONT PAGES DAILY MIRROR'S HEADLINE REVOLTING AND THAT'S BECAUSE SO MANY CONSERVATIVE M.P.S ARE SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE CUTS TO DISABILITY THAT THE CHANCELLOR ANNOUNCED IAN BERYL WHO
FORMER SPEECH WRITER DAVID CANNON WRITES IN THE TELEGRAPH SOMETIMES YOU CAN ONLY SHAKE YOUR HEAD AT THE SHEER STUPIDITY OF POLITICIAN SO STUCK IN THEIR WESTMINSTER BUT LIMIT BUBBLE THEY MAKE THE OBVIOUS MOST OBVIOUS MISTAKES FOR IT'S HARD TO THINK OF A WORSE MESSAGE TO OFFER THEIR COUNTRY AND ON THE ONE SENT BY THE GOVERNMENT THIS WEEK AND HE MAKES THE POINT FORGET THE FROTH OVER THE SUGAR TASKS TAX THE LASTING IMPRESSION OF THE BUDGET WILL BE MAKING HEFTY SAVINGS
HITTING PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS DISABILITIES WHILE HANDING TAX CUTS TO PROP PROSPEROUS PROFESSIONALS AND HE ARGUES THAT MY ONE IS FORTUNATE THERE'S NOT A FUNCTIONING OP OPPOSITION BUT STILL NEEDS TO MAKE ANOTHER OF HIS TRADEMARK U. TURNS AND
COFFEE CUP SIZE IS THE LEAD OR ARE THE LEAD FOR THE DAILY MAIL SUGGESTIONS THAT DISPOSABLE COFFEE CUP SHOULD BE TAXED LIKE THROWAWAY SHOPPING BAGS IGNITED ARROYO IT SAYS BETWEEN MINISTERS LAST NIGHT THE ENVIRONMENT MINISTER RORY STEWART TOLD M.P.S THAT THE DISPOSABLE CUPS COULD BE TAXED TO PREVENT BILLIONS ENDING UP IN A TIDAL WAVE OF RUBBISH HE SAID THE WAVES CAUSED BY THE CUPS IN THE HUGE PROBLEM AND THE IDEA OF A LEVY WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING TO LOOK AT BUT
WITHIN WHITEHALL OFFICIALS APPARENTLY TRIED TO KILL OFF THAT IDEA AND ONLY THREE HOURS AFTER MISTER STEWART HAD ADDRESSED M. PIECES OWN DEPARTMENT THE STATEMENT SAYING THERE WERE NO PLANS TO TAX COFFEE CUPS SO NOW YOU KNOW OR NOT O.K.
THE TELEGRAPH THAT PICKS UP ON A STORY ABOUT ARMY PILOTS WHO ARE THREATENING TO QUIT SOME HAVE ACTUALLY QUIT OVER A PLAN BY THE MILITARY OF DEFENCE TO CLAW BACK MONEY THEY WERE PAID APPARENTLY BECAUSE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR A DECADE AGO THESE PILOTS WERE PAID TOO MUCH IT'S A TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEN OUR BEING
PUSHED TO PAY IT BACK ACCORDING TO THE PAPER AT LEAST FIFTEEN PILOTS HAVE ALREADY RESIGNED MORE OR THREATENING TO DO SO AS THERE IS A SHORTAGE ACCORDING TO THE PAPER IN WHAT THEY SAY IS ALREADY OVERSTRETCHED ARMY AIR CORPS THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT IT WILL HAVE NEARLY IS NOW TEN PAST SIX BRAZIL IS GOING THROUGH THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY POLITICAL CRISIS ONLY A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE OLYMPICS ARE DUE TO BE HELD THERE OF COURSE OUR CORRESPONDENT THERE IS CAMILLA COS SUE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING I KNOW IT'S A COMPLICATED STORY BUT BASICALLY IT'S A TALE OF CORRUPTION AT THE VERY TOP INVOLVING THE PAST PRESIDENT A VERY POPULAR ONE MY LUNA AND THE NEW PRESIDENT DUMA RUSSIA YES THOSE ARE THE LATEST CHAPTER IN THIS MAJOR CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION WHICH STARTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IT LOOKS INTO A SCHEME TO SECURE CONTRACTS FOR BRAZIL STOP CONSTRUCTION COMPANY
THE COUNTRY IS A STATE COMPANY BUT IT'S NOW IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THIS INVESTIGATION HAS SEEN TOP EXECUTIVES ARRESTED IN HAS IMPLICATED POLITICIANS IN ALL OF BRAZIL'S MAJOR PARTIES FORMER PRESIDENT LOLA THE SILVER WHO WAS ONE OF BRAZIL'S MOST POPULAR LEADERS IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR ALLEGEDLY HAVING RECEIVED GIFTS FROM CONSTRUCTION FIRMS THERE WERE BENEFITED FROM
WITH INFLATED CONTRACTS OR BETTER BUT TWO WEEKS AGO IT LOOKED LIKE INVESTIGATORS WERE CLOSE TO CHARGING HIM FOR CORRUPTION BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND THEN PRESIDENT OF SURPRISED EVERYONE BY INVITING HIM TO BE HER CHIEF OF STAFF AS A MINISTER HE WILL HAVE PROSECUTION PRIVILEGES
AND ONLY BRAZIL SUPREME COURT WOULD BE ABLE TO TRY HIM AND THEN ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT THIS WHOLE CRISIS TOOK A BIZARRE TURN REALLY AS A JUDGE READ YIELD PHONE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN PRESIDENT DUMA END LOLA WHO WAS HER MENTOR NOW LAW
HELLO HELLO LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING TELL ME DEAR LISTEN I'M SENDING YOU MY ADVISER B. C. S. WITH A PAPER FOR ARSENAL HEAVY TEN ONLY USE IT IF NECESSARY O.K. O.K. O.K. THAT'S IT WAIT THERE AND HE'S GOING THERE O.K. I'M HERE I'LL BE WAITING OH K. O. K. BUY I DO
PUT PUT ASIDE THE PROPRIETIES OF THE GO IN AND ALL THAT BUT THIS MUST HAVE SHOCKED PEOPLE
TELLS LOLA BUT SHE'S SENDING HIM A DOCUMENT WHICH HE CAN USE IF NECESSARY THERE DOCUMENT CONFIRMS RULERS NOMINATION AS A MINISTER ONE READING OF THEIR CONVERSATION SUGGESTS BALOO LOCKWOOD USER SHOULD USE THIS DOCUMENT
IN KAY'S PROSECUTORS WANT TO CHARGE HIM BEFORE HE'S SWORN IN THERE WOULD CORROBORATE THE IDEA THAT HIS NOMINATION WAS NOTHING BUT A PLAN TO SAVE HIM FROM PRISON BUT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THIS WAS JUST A BUREAUCRATIC PROCEDURE NOW THEY'RE JUDGE THERE REVEAL THIS CONVERSATION ALSO HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR USING THEM PUT THOSE CONVERSATIONS POLITICALLY TO FERDY DE STABILISE PRESIDENT YOU'LL SERVE GOVERNMENT
THE BEANO SINCE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE RIDLEY'S SPONTANEOUS PROTEST ERUPTED IN MORE THAN FIFTEEN CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ASKING FOR LOLA'S ARREST EN DUMA WHOLE SERVES RESIGNATION SO AS YOU SEE THIS DID HAVE THE EFFECT OF FURTHER DE STABILISING THE GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNMENT IT IS IN A VERY VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION RIGHT NOW AND THE MOOD HERE IS VERY TENSE THANKS CAMILLA
IT'S THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT IN BRUSSELS BY THE TIME ALL E.U. LEADERS HAD AGREED AT WHAT THEY COULD OFFER TURKEY TO TRY TO SORT OUT THE MIGRANT CRISIS THEY'LL BE PUTTING THE DEAL TO THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER LATER TODAY A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS IS ON THE LINE NOW AND CHRIS HOW DID THEY SATISFY ALL THOSE WHO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL TO HAVE ONE MIGRANT ONE IN ONE OUT AS IT'S CALLED
YEAH MORNING SERI IT'S STILL VERY COMPLICATED LESS COMPLICATED THAN BRAZIL WE HOPE WE'LL SEE DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY WHAT'S HAPPENED IS ESSENTIALLY E.U. STATES HAVE WATERED DOWN THE INCENTIVES THEY'RE OFFERING TO TURKEY AND THEY'VE TRIED TO INCLUDE SOME NEW MEASURES TO OVERCOME THE LEGAL OBJECTIONS THAT MANY COUNTRY HAD TO HAVE ABOUT SENDING BACK MIGRANTS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY
ABOUT A LACK OF LEGAL CLARITY IN THE WAY THAT TURKEY TREATS REFUGEES ESPECIALLY REFUGEES FROM COUNTRIES OTHER THAN SYRIA BECAUSE THEY HAVE GIVEN TEMPORARY PROTECTION TO PEOPLE COMING FROM SYRIA BUT NEARLY HALF THE PEOPLE WHO CROSSED OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS FROM
TURKEY TO THE GREEK ISLANDS HAVE BEEN FROM TWO OTHER COUNTRIES AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND IT'S VERY UNCLEAR WHAT LEGAL PROTECTION PEOPLE FLEEING FROM THOSE COUNTRIES WERE OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE WARS GOING ON THERE MAY WELL BE MANY MANY PEOPLE IN NEED OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION IT'S VERY UNCLEAR WHAT KIND OF LEGAL PROTECTION THEY WOULD HAVE IN TURKEY SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW IS THAT
DONALD TUSCAN JEAN CLAUDE JUNK AT THE LEADERS OF THE E.U. INSTITUTIONS WILL MEET WITH THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER AND THEN ALL THE E.U. LEADERS WILL MEET WITH HIM LATER THIS MORNING AROUND ABOUT LUNCHTIME BUT I THINK THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL HURDLES TO OVERCOME AND WHAT THEY'RE PROMISING IS THAT EACH PERSON CLAIMING ASYLUM WILL BE GIVEN A FULL HEARING IN GREECE IN WANT TO SUDDENLY WOULD BLUNT THE THE AIM OF THE SCHEME WOULDN'T IT
THAT'S ANOTHER MASSIVE PROBLEM EVEN IF THEY ACTUALLY REACH AGREEMENT TODAY THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS GREASE SOUNDS AS AN ASYLUM SYSTEM THAT WAS DISMISSED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO ESSENTIALLY IS NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE AND THE GREEKS ARE SAYING IF THIS IS GOING TO WORK WE NEED THOUSANDS
OF QUALIFIED OFFICIALS FROM OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES TO COME TO THE ISLANDS TO HELP US SET UP A FUNCTIONALLY ASYLUM SYSTEM WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO SET UP TRIBUNALS WHICH EACH INDIVIDUAL ARRIVING MIGRANT WOULD POTENTIALLY BE ABLE TO HAVE THE RIGHT OF APPEAL IT'S A MASSIVE LOGISTICAL EFFORT NEVER MIND THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL CAUSE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT'S BEING APPROVED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND AS FOR AND TURKEY'S A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. THAT BECOMES CLOSER AS A RESULT OF THIS DEAL DOES IT
NOT AS CLOSE AS AS THE TURKS WOULD LIKE AND A LOT OF THAT REVOLVES AROUND ITS FORTY YEAR DISPUTE WITH CYPRUS WHAT'S BECOME VERY CLEAR IS THAT THE IDEA OF TURKEY CITIZENS BEING GIVEN A VISA FREE ACCESS TO THE SHANG ZONE BY THE END OF JUNE POTENTIALLY SOMETHING WHICH HAS NOW BECOME A BIT OF AN ISSUE IN THE IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IN THE U.K. THAT WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF TURKEY MEETS SEVENTY TWO PRECONDITIONS
AND THEY THEY RANGE FROM EVERYTHING ON BIOMETRIC PASSPORTS TO JUDICIAL CO OPERATION TO ITS RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING CYPRUS AND IF OUT OF THOSE SEVENTY TWO PRE PRECONDITIONS IT'S ACHIEVED LESS THAN HALF AT THE MOMENT TO HAVE VISA THREE TRAVEL BY THE END OF JUNE IT WOULD NEED TO PASS ALL THOSE TERMS WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AGAIN A VERY VERY TIGHT TIMETABLE CHRIS MORRIS THANK YOU
SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX NOW IF YOU WERE A BILLIONAIRE HOW DO YOU MAY VERY WELL BE I SUPPOSE DO YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL PULL OUT I RAISE THE QUESTION BECAUSE TANYA YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO ONE OF OUR BILLIONAIRES YES LOOK I WAS WORRIED YOU WERE GOING TO ACCUSE ME OF BEING WHAT I AM
AS A U.K. VOTE ON WHETHER TO STAY IN OR OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION APPROACHES THIS JUNE WE'VE HEARD LOTS OF BUSINESS VOICES ON WHY THEY THINK IT'S VITAL TO COMMERCE THAT THE U.K. SHOULD STAY IAN BUT I SPOKE TO THE FOUNDER OF THE BRISTOL BASED FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM HARGREAVES LANDS DOWN PETER HARGREAVES WHO THINKS BRITAIN SHOULD LEAVE MY HARGREAVES AS TOLD THE TODAY PROGRAMME A FRESH START COULD HELP BRITAIN INFLATE HE ALSO USES THE EXAMPLE OF SINGAPORE BECOMING INDEPENDENT FROM MALAYSIA
AND HOW SUCCESSFUL IT BECAME AFTERWARDS YOU KNOW THERE IS ONE BIG THING IN ALL THIS AND I'M FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT THAT DAY IF HOPEFULLY WE DECIDE TO LEAVE
THAT LITTLE BIT OF INSECURITY THAT LITTLE BIT OF UNKNOWN WILL BE AN ABSOLUTE PHILIP TO EVERYONE IT'LL BE A GREAT INCENTIVE FOR US TO GO OUT AND PROVE THAT IT'S RIGHT AND I JUST THINK I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE WHEN SINGAPORE BECAME INDEPENDENT FROM MALAYSIA THAT LITTLE INSECURITY THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER PART OF MALAYSIA IT WAS AN INSPIRATION AND IT'S NOW
PROBABLY THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND I AND I HONESTLY THINK THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR US AS WELL THAT A LITTLE BIT OF INSECURITY WILL BE FANTASTIC STIMULUS FOR US
WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT HAPPENED TO E. U. WORKERS AND E.U. TALENTS THAT WE RELY UPON HERE WHAT HAPPENED IF BRITAIN LEFT WELL I'D HELP PICK OUT THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT HERE WE KEEP WE WILL ALWAYS IN POOR PEOPLE TO DO THE JOBS THAT WE NEED DOING HERE I MEAN WE WE IMPORT FILIPINO NURSES
PART OF THE E.U. WE IMPORT PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO HELP US WITH WITH THE JOBS THAT NEED DOING HERE WON'T STOP AS IMPORTING PAUL ISH WORKERS AND AND OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WOULD FOLLOW ABRAXAS IT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM TO REASSURE THEM THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY WE RAISE MONEY FOR THE RUSSIANS WE RAISE MONEY ALL OVER THE WORLD
COUNTRIES ARE NOT IN EUROPE AND THERE ISN'T THE EXPERTISE IN IN INK IN FRANKFURT AND PARIS TO DO THAT YOU CAN'T SUDDENLY HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DO IT BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO USE LONDON THEY'VE GOT TO USE LONDON
LONDON CAN RAISE BILLIONS ON A FEW PHONE CALLS AND NO ONE ELSE CAN THEY DO THAT MOST PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE CITY WOULDN'T WANT TO WORK IN PARIS AND BE TAXED TO THE HELP MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T WANT TO WORK IN FRANKFORT THEY LOVE WORKING IN LONDON BECAUSE LONDON IS A FANTASTIC PLACE TO WORK SO THESE PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO MOVE AND SO IF PEOPLE WANT IT TO BE DONE THEY'VE GOT TO COME TO LONDON COS THAT'S WHERE WE ARE PETER HARGREAVES OF HARGREAVES LOVES
BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AMONG THE U.K.'S SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES IT OUT IT IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL FOR THREE YEARS AND THIS IS ACCORDING TO A SURVEY OUT THIS MORNING FROM THE FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES IT STARTS ITS CONFERENCE IN GLASGOW TODAY MIGHT CHERRY JOINS US HE'S THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE F.S.B. HE JOINS US FROM OUR STUDIOS IN GLASGOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MIKE SO BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AT A LOW SINCE WHEN DO YOU THINK THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE HAS THERE BEEN A DOWNTURN
WE CLEARLY SAW A KNOCKING CONFIDENCE AFTER THE CHANCELLOR'S ALLOWANCE MONTHS LAST SUMMER AND AS WE KNOW BUSINESS FACES SOME SIGNIFICANT COS COMING THROUGH WITH THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE STARTING ONLY NEXT MONTH IN APRIL MOST SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE NOW GOT TO CONTEND WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND COST AS AUTO ENROLMENT STARTS TO KICK IN OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND WE SAW THE CHANGES TO DO EVIDENCE TAX
SO YES CONFIDENCE IS DOWN AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE FIRST FOUR IN THE JOBS BEING CREATED BY OUR MEMBERS IN THE LATEST SURVEY SINCE QUARTER TO IN TWENTY THIRTEEN EXPORTS ARE ALSO SHOWING THEIR WEAKEST PERFORMANCE
THIS WEEK'S BUDGET VERY CLEARLY HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE THINGS WE'VE BEEN MAKING SURE THAT THE CHANCELLOR HEARD EXACTLY WHAT SMALL BUSINESS HE'D WANTED
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF MAKING THE DOUBLING OF THE SMALL BUSINESS RATES RELIEF PERMANENT I WAS A VERY VERY WELCOME STEP FORWARDS ON THE ROUTE TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN CALLING FOR A TOTAL REFORM OF THIS UNFAIR AND UNJUST TAX NOW I KNOW THAT THE FEDERATION SMALL BUSINESSES IT'S NEUTRAL ON THE ISSUE OF BRECHT'S IT HOWEVER YOUR MEMBERS HAVE A VIEW WHAT IS THAT FOR YOU WELL WE SURVEYED OUR MEMBERS WE KICK THIS OFF AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR
WE HAD THAT CONFIRMED WHEN THE RESULTS WERE ANNOUNCED LAST AUTUMN AND IF YOU LOOK JUST AT THE HEADLINES OF COURSE IT SHOWED FORTY SEVEN PER CENT OF OUR MEMBERS WOULD CHOOSE PROBABLY TO REMAIN IN FORTY ONE PER CENT WOULD PROBABLY CHOOSE TO COME OUT AND ELEVEN PERCENT WERE UNDECIDED AND I THINK THE FORTY ONE PER CENT IS THE PERCENTAGE THAT IS GOING TO INTEREST A LOT OF PEOPLE WHY WOULD SMALL OR MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES
BE ALMOST AMBIVALENT ABOUT IT WELL THAT'S LOOK BEHIND THOSE HEADLINES OR SAY THOSE WERE THE HEADLINES THAT CAME OUT LAST AUTUMN AND WHAT VERY CLEARLY ALSO CAME OUT BEHIND THOSE FIGURES WAS AROUND ABOUT A THIRD AT THAT TIME STATED VERY CLEARLY THAT THEY HAD NOT GOT ENOUGH INFORMATION THEY NEEDED MORE INDEPENDENT FACTS ON WHICH TO ACTUALLY MAKE UP THEIR MINDS WE POLLED THE MEMBERS AGAIN
WE HAD OVER FOUR THOUSAND RESPONSES JUST AFTER THE PRIME MINISTER HAD COME BACK FROM BRUSSELS AND THAT SHOWED VERY CLEARLY THAT WELL OVER FORTY PER CENT NEEDED MORE INFORMATION ON WHICH TO MAKE UP THEIR MIND FOR THEIR BUSINESS MIGHT JUST VERY BRIEFLY A COMMENT ON THE ECONOMIC GLOBAL OUTLOOK BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING VERY MUCH THAT CAME UP IN THE BUDGET IS THAT THERE IS THERE IS OR THE PERRIN DOUBT OF EXPECTATIONS THAT I THINK THAT'S RIGHT WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE KNOCK ON EFFECTS COMING BACK FROM CHINA'S
ECONOMY AT THE MOMENT THAT'S TAKING A SLOWDOWN BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN A FALL IN THE POUND AS AGAINST THE EURO AND THE DOLLAR WHICH SHOULD HELP OUR EXPORTERS SO I THINK WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN THE BUDGET THIS WEEK THAT WILL CERTAINLY GIVE A FILLIP TO SMALL BUSINESSES ALTHOUGH WE'VE GOT THE COST COMING DOWN THE TRACK VERY QUICKLY MY CHERRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LET'S JUST GET A QUICK COMMENT FROM DAVID STUBBS CAESAR GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT J.P. MORGAN
ASSET MANAGEMENT DAVID DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THAT BUSINESSES ARE FEELING GLOOMY BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS WHICH HAVE CREATED LET'S FACE IT SOME OF THAT CLAIM ACTUALLY IN LONDON AND ON WALL STREET THERE AND POSITIVE TERRITORY NOW SO FAR FOR THE YEAR YEAR TODAY I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A PRETTY DRAMATIC YEAR ON ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS WORRIES ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY BIG MOVEMENTS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE NOW OBVIOUSLY CHANGES IN THE BUDGET AND BREAKS IT OF COURSE BEING THE SHADOW THAT CERTAIN IT'S OVER AT ALL
I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT IS IT'S A SURPRISE AT ALL YEAH WE ARE EXPECTING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND THEN INVESTMENT INTENTIONS TO BE DAMAGED BY THE UNCERTAINTY OF THIS DEBATE AND JUST VERY BRIEFLY A COMMENT ON WHAT PETER HARGREAVES HAD TO SAY A LITTLE BIT EARLIER ON THAT REALLY THIS IS IF WE DID ENGAGE IN BRACK'S IT IF IF THE U.K. LEFT THE E.U.
BUT YOU LEAP OF CONFIDENCE WE WOULD GET OVER IT TO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CITY SHARE UP VIEW AND I DON'T THINK THEY DO AT THAT AT THE MOMENT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT ARGUMENT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF LIVING IN TERMS OF FREEING US UP FOR CERTAIN DIFFERENT THINGS HOWEVER OUR EXPECTATION REMAINS THAT AFTER A NOISY CAMPAIGN THAT WILL DRAG DOWN U.K. ASSETS AND QUITE A LOT OF VOLATILITY THE COUNTRY WILL VOTE TO STAY IN DAVID STUBBS THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW IT IS TIME FOR A FRIDAY BOSS

FIGURES SEEN BY THE B.B.C. SHOW THAT SPENDING ON HEALTH AND EDUCATION WILL BE SQUEEZED BY MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS BECAUSE OF CHANGES TO PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS IN THE BUDGET IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT EMPLOYERS SUCH AS N.H.S. TRUSTS AND SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE MORE TO STAFF PENSIONS IN THREE YEARS' TIME TREASURY OFFICIALS ADMITTED THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL COST FOR THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS BUT SAID THEY'D BEEN AWARE THE CHANGES WERE COMING
A CHARITY HAS WARNED THAT PEOPLE WITH AUTISM OR DYING EARLIER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION CITING RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN SWEDEN AUTISTIC OR SAYS PEOPLE WITH THE CONDITION DIE ON AVERAGE AT THE AGE OF FIFTY FOUR THAT SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THOSE WITHOUT AUTISM IT SAYS EPILEPTIC SEIZURES HEART DISEASE AND SUICIDE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF PREMATURE DEATH
THEY'VE HELD THE DUBIOUS TITLE OF TOP PEST FOR MORE THAN A DECADE THAT SLUGS AND SNAILS HAVE BEEN YOU SERVED BY AN INVASIVE HEDGE EATING CATERPILLAR
THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY WHICH COMPILES THE LIST SAYS THE BOX TREE CATERPILLAR PROMPTED THE MOST CALLS FROM CONCERNED GARDENERS LAST YEAR THE INSECT WHICH IS NATIVE TO ASIA WAS FIRST FOUND IN THE U.K. IN TWENTY ELEVEN
TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH BEDS AVAILABLE IN HOSPITALS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL AND DANGEROUS THAT'S GENERALLY AGREED WHAT'S NOT AGREE WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT WHEN A REPORTER SANCHA BURGERS HAD MOST UNUSUAL ACCESS
TO ONE OF THE HOSPITAL FOR THE MENTALLY ILL WHO ARE ALSO CRIMINALLY HE'LL CRIMINAL YOU DANGEROUS KNACKERS BUT CENSURE THIS THE PROBLEM IS WHAT THAT THE MOMENT THEY GO TO PRISON AND THEY ARE NOT BEING TREATED IN PRISON WELL THEY CAN EITHER GO TO PRISON BECOME SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL IN PRISON AND BE TRANSFERRED TO ONE OF THESE HOSPITALS
OR THEY CAN BE SENTENCED DIRECTLY BY THE COURT TO ONE OF THESE HOSPITALS IN THE KIND OF PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED SOME OF THE WORST VIOLENT OFFENCES YOU CAN THINK OF MURDER RAPE SERIOUS VIOLENT ASSAULT SERIOUSLY VIOLENT ROBBERIES AND THEY'VE DONE THESE WHILE IN THE GRIP OF A MENTAL ILLNESS SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SENTENCED TO A SECURE HOSPITAL AND WHILE
THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF BIRDS THERE FIVE THOUSAND MEDIUM SECURE BEDS THERE ARE PEOPLE SAYING THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS CRISIS IN OUR PRISONS WHERE PEOPLE WHO BECOME SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL IN PRISON OFTEN DON'T GET TRANSFERRED QUICKLY TO HOSPITAL PERHAPS WE SHOULD LOOK AT HAVING MORE OF THESE BEDS
THE REAL INTEREST IS THAT IT'S VERY VERY UNUSUAL TO GET INTO ONE OF THESE UNITS WHICH YOU HAVE MANAGED TO DO BETHLEM HOSPITAL IS LET'S UNVEIL IT YES THE DESCENDED TO BEDLAM IT WAS ORIGINALLY BEDLAM WHERE PEOPLE WOULD CALL THAT THE MENTALLY ILL CENTURIES AGO NOW IT'S THE BEST THEM ROYAL HOSPITAL IN SOUTH LONDON AND I SPENT TIME IN THE WARD WHERE DOCTORS ARE DECIDING
ASSESSING PEOPLE DECIDING WHETHER THEY CAN BE RELEASED INTO THE COMMUNITY WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISIONS YOU CAN IMAGINE OR GET IT WRONG AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE HORRENDOUS WHICH IS WHY IT'S A VERY STAGED CAREFUL PROCESS EVERY STEP IS MONITORED BY THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
IT CAN TAKE A VERY VERY LONG TIME TO RELEASE SOMEONE INTO THE COMMUNITY AND IF AT ANY POINT ANY OF THESE PEOPLE LAPS IF FOR EXAMPLE AS I SAW SOMEBODY WHO WAS BEING DISCHARGED ACTUALLY TOOK COCAINE AND HEROIN
WHILE THEY WERE IN THE HOSTEL THIS COMMUNITY HOSTEL UNDER SUPERVISION THEN THEY'RE WHIPPED BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL WHERE THEY HAVE TO IF YOU LIKE CARRY ON WITH THE STEPS UNTIL THEY'RE FIT TO RELEASE AGAIN WELL WE'LL HEAR YOUR FULL REPORT FROM INSIDE BETHLEM AT TEN PAST EIGHT BUT FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE IS ZERO CHANCE OF GETTING IT THROUGH THAT'S WHAT A CONSERVATIVE M.P. SAID YESTERDAY ABOUT THE CHANCELLOR'S PLANNED CUTS TO DISABILITY PAYMENTS SUCH IS THE SCALE OF THE
TORY REBELLION ON THERE'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON JOINS US AND CHRIS THERE ARE ALREADY HINTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY RETHINK IT YES THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN WAS ON QUESTION TIME LAST NIGHT AND SUGGESTED THAT THIS WHOLE PROPOSAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED AT LAST FRIDAY AHEAD OF THE BUDGET WAS MERELY A SUGGESTION AND THAT CONSULTATIONS WOULD CONTINUE THAT WASN'T SO MUCH THE TONE OF THE PUBLICATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO I THINK WHAT
CONSERVATIVES AS A SENIOR LEVEL ARE VERY AWARE OF IS THAT THEY HAVE A PRETTY SMALL MAJORITY A WORKING MAJORITY OF SEVENTEEN SO YOU DON'T NEED COACHLOADS OF TORY M.P.S YOU BARELY NEED A MODERATELY FILLED MINIBUS OF CONSERVATIVE M.P.S TO CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TROUBLE ON ALL OF THIS AND PLENTY HAVE SPOTTED WHAT WESTMINSTER TYPES LIKE TO CALL THEE
OPTICS OF THIS ANOTHER WORDS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND ARE CONSCIOUS THAT AS THESE CHANGES KICKIN NEXT JANUARY IT'S JUST AROUND ABOUT THE TIME BUT THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE THE CHANGE IN THE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE RELATIVELY WELL OFF AND THEY FEAR THAT IT'S BETRAYS THE CONSERVATIVES ALONG LONGER STEREOTYPICAL LINES THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO ESCAPE FOR AS LONG AS THEY'VE BEEN IN GOVERNMENT AND IN TERMS OF WHAT ELSE WE ARE UNCOVERING ABOUT THE BUDGET IN THE SMALL PRINT THERE'S SOME CONCERNS OVER THE DEFENCE BUDGET
THERE IS THIS CONCERNS OVER DEFENCE BUDGET CONCERNS OVER PENSION COSTS AS WELL SO YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF OPPOSITION PARTIES DRILLING INTO THE DETAILS OF THE RED BOOK ON THE DEFENCE BUDGET LABOUR HAVE SPOTTED WHEN YOU LOOK AT PAGE NINETY ONE ON THE TABLE THERE BUT THERE IS A APPARENT GAP OF EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS BETWEEN PROJECTED DEFENCE SPENDING FROM THE LAST BUDGET IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WHERE IT IS BEING
TALLIED UP TO RIGHT NOW AND SAY THEY ARE ASKING QUESTIONS IN A LETTER TO THE DEFENCE SECRETARY WHAT ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR DEFENCE SPENDING AT THE TREASURY IN TRYING TO HAVE SOMETHING OF A RESPONSE VERY LATE LAST NIGHT EFFECTIVELY SAID THAT THIS WAS ABOUT MOVING MONEY AROUND FROM ONE BUDGET TO ANOTHER AND IT SHOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE BUT YOU ARE GETTING SOME SENSE ON A RANGE OF THINGS NOW THAT THE TREASURY IS HOPING THAT VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS BUDGET WON'T UNRAVEL
CHRIS MASON THANKS VERY MUCH TWENTY TO SEVEN TRAIN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE REGULATOR THAT THEY HAVE TO DO MORE TO TELL PASSENGERS WHEN THEY'RE ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION AND HOW TO GET IT SIMON GONE BUT HE'S A PERSONAL FINANCE REPORTER WHAT ARE THEY NOT DOING THAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING SIMON
WELL THE PROBLEM IS AT THE MOMENT THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO CAN CLAIM REFUNDS WHEN THERE'S A DELAY DON'T SEEM TO CLAIM IT AND THERE ISN'T MUCH INFORMATION PROVIDED IT'S IT'S HARD TO PICK UP THE FORMS OUGHTA FIND THEM TRAIN COMPANY WEBSITES AND OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE ASK STAFF ON THE PLATFORM OR ON THE TRAIN WHAT THEY SHOULD DO THEY GET THE WRONG INFORMATION SO THE OFFICE OF RAIL AND ROAD TO RAIL REGULATOR IS ASKING FOR MORE
ACTION AND THERE'S THIS QUITE A LOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A DELAY OF HALF AN HOUR WITH MOST COMPANIES YOU CAN APPLY TO GET FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TICKET COSTS BACK IF THAT HOLD UP EXTENDS TO AN HOUR YOU CAN GET THE WHOLE AMOUNT REALLY
SO ONE OF THE SORT OF TEN MINUTES WELL THEN YOU CAN'T APPLY BUT OF COURSE SO WHAT I'M GOING TO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AT THE MOMENT IS THAT TRAIN COMPANIES HAVE DIFFERENT RULES FOR THIS ACCORDING TO WHEN THEY GOT THEIR FRANCHISE BUT THERE IS AN IMPROVEMENT IN THAT MORE OF THEM
ON A SYSTEM CALLED DELAY REPAID NOW WHERE THEY GET THEIR OPTIMUM AMOUNT OF MONEY BACK BUT THE REGULATOR IS NOW CALLING FOR MORE TRAINING FOR STAFF FOR CLEAR ANNOUNCEMENTS WHEN A TRAIN COMES IN AND IT'S LATE ON THE TRAIN AND ON THE PLATFORM TO INFORM PEOPLE WHAT THEY CAN DO BETTER WEBSITES AND FOR A BIG PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN IN THE AUTUMN TO MAKE SURE MORE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT AND THEN THEY WILL BE DOING MYSTERY SHOPPING EXERCISES TO TO TO MONITOR HOW EFFECTIVE
IT IS I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE TRAIN COMPANIES WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO BE ANNOUNCING YOUR TRAINING IT'S AN HOUR LATE CLAIM ALL YOUR MONEY BACK THEY WON'T WANT TO DO THAT WILL THEY NO BUT SOME ARE BETTER AND ARE DOING THAT OR ALREADY SAID THERE IS SOME MOVEMENT IN THE COMPANY SAY THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THEIR PROCESSES CLEARER AND SIMPLER AND IN FACT TWO COMPANIES PART OF VIRGIN AND ONE OF THE TRAIN COMPANY C. TWO C. WHICH OPERATES FROM LONDON TO ESSEX
AUTOMATICALLY PAY SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMERS COMPENSATION SO IF YOU'RE SIGNED UP AS A REGULAR CUSTOMER IF YOUR TRAIN IS LATE YOU'LL AUTOMATICALLY GET THE REFUND INTO YOUR ACCOUNT SO THAT THINGS ARE IMPROVING AND ALL OF THIS COMES FROM WHAT'S CALLED A SUPER COMPLAINT FROM WHICH THE CONSUMER GROUP WHO SIGNPOSTED HOW TERRIBLE THE SITUATION WAS AND THEY HAVE WELCOMED THIS INITIATIVE THEY SAY IT'S A GOOD FIRST STEP BUT THEY WEREN'T THE REGULATOR TO HAVE MORE TEETH MORE POWERS TO IMPLEMENT THIS SORT OF THING QUICKLY
SIMON MORE OF THAT LATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S EIGHTY MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE TELEGRAPH BELIEVES THERE ARE SIGNS THE CHANCELLOR'S BUDGET IS BEGINNING TO UNRAVEL AS SCHOOLS OF CONSERVATIVE M.P.S THREATENED TO REBEL OVER DISABILITY WELFARE CUTS ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN SOME UNHAPPY SENIOR TORIES SAY THE HANDLING OF THE AFFAIR IS REMINISCENT OF THE WAY THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT ALIENATED JUNIOR DOCTORS TORY M.P.S ARE LINING UP TO BLOCK THE CRUEL CUTS TO DISABILITY BENEFITS SAYS THE DAILY MIRROR UNDER THE HEADLINE REVOLTING
THE PAPERS ARE DIVIDED ON IT MORE MUST LISTEN TO HIS PARTY THAT'S WHAT THE INDEPENDENT SAYS THE ANGRY RESPONSE SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN HIM BY SURPRISE THE TELEGRAPH THE THINGS THERE IS STILL A CASE TO BE MADE FOR THE CHANGES BUT SADLY MISTER OSBORNE'S HANDLING OF THE ISSUE SO FAR MEANS IT'S HARDER MAKE IT THE MIRROR SAYS RETREAT FOR PITY'S SAKE OF ALL THE SPURIOUS SLOGANS UTTERED BY GEORGE OSBORNE NONE RINGS MORE HOLLOW
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER THEIR SUPPORT FROM THE SUN FOR A CALL BY DAVID CAMERON AT THE E.U. MIGRANT TALKS IN BRUSSELS FOR PATROL SHIPS TO ADOPT THE AUSTRALIAN APPROACH AND TURN AWAY REFUGEE BOATS TO DETER OTHERS FROM MAKING THE JOURNEY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO STOP MORE ARRIVING THE PAPER SAYS GET TOUGH IT'S A HARDLINE BUT IT WORKS ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN ENGLAND ARE ALARMED AT THE PROSPECT OF HUGE STRUCTURAL UPHEAVAL IN EDUCATION
THE ADMINISTRATION OF ENGLAND SCHOOLS HAS BECOME INCOHERENT IT SAYS IN THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN'S WHITE PAPER DESTROYS ANY ATTEMPTED EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHILE SOME OF HER PROPOSALS ARE SENSIBLE ANSWERS THE GARDEN SHE NEEDS TO SLOW DOWN AND BUILD TWO LAST THERE'S TALK OF A TORY WAR IN THE DAILY MAIL THIS TIME OVER A SUGGESTION FROM THE ENVIRONMENT MINISTER RORY STEWART THAT DISPOSABLE COFFEE CUPS COULD BE TAXED
HIS COMMENTS TRIGGERED DISARRAY AND FIGHTING IN WHITEHALL THE PAPER SAYS WITH OFFICIALS APPARENTLY ORDER TO TRY TO KILL OFF THE IDEA THE MAIL SAYS TWO AND A HALF BILLION PLASTIC LINE CUT ISSUED A YEAR WITH JUST ONE IN FOUR HUNDRED RECYCLED TIMES REPORTS AT THE BILLIONAIRE PHILANTHROPIST AND TORY PARTY DONOR THAT THICK SIDE HAS BEEN BLACKLISTED BY BARCLAYS BANK ALONG WITH HIS ASSOCIATED CHARITIES AND BUSINESSES BRITISH BANKS ARE SAID TO BE INCREASINGLY WARY ABOUT INFORMATION THEY HAVE TO SUPPLY TO REGULATORS
MY SIDE HAS ACCUSED THE BANK OF IRRATIONAL AND IRRESPONSIBLE CONDUCT THE TIMES SAYS THERE IS NO SUGGESTION OF ANY WRONGDOING ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT BIG CORPORATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES HAD TO BE GIVEN A MAJOR SAY IN E.U. LAW MAKING A LEAKED DOCUMENT FROM SECRET TRADE NEGOTIATIONS IS ALSO SAID TO SHOW THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WILL DECIDE IN WHICH AREAS THERE WILL BE CO OPERATION WITH THE U.S. LEAVING E.U. MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AS THE PAPER PUTS IT
FURTHER SIDELINED UNDER THE DEAL THE COMMISSION WELL ITSELF APPARENTLY BE OBLIGED TO CONSULT U.S. AUTHORITIES BEFORE ADOPTING NEW LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS ON ITS FRONT PAGE THIS IS ITS FRONT PAGE HEADLINE REPORTS THAT A MEMBER OF THE S.A.S. AS WON A MILLION POUNDS ON THE NATIONAL LOTTERY THE HEADLINE WELL YOU CAN GUESS CARLY YEAH WHO DARES WINS
THAT'S IT THE TIME NOW IS A QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A HEADLINE THIS MORNING IS THAT E.U. LEADERS OF THE GREAT CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSALS TO RESOLVE THE MIGRANT CRISIS BUT TURKEY WILL HAVE TO MEET STRICT CONDITIONS A IT WANTS VISA FREE TRAVEL TO EUROPE AS PART OF THE PLAN
DOWNING STREET SAYS THE GOVERNOR STRIDE TO MAKE SURE THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY GOES TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST NUMBER TEN WAS TAKEN WITH TALKING ABOUT THE LATEST ROW OVER DISABILITY BENEFITS AFTER THE CHANCELLOR ANNOUNCING HIS BUDGET THE CHANGES ARE GOING TO BE MADE TO PERSONAL INDEPENDENT PAYMENTS OR PIPS BUT GEORGE OSBORNE IS FACING OPPOSITION FROM WHAT HE'S SAID TO BE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVE M.P.S AND LABOUR HAS CONDEMNED THE THING HERE IS A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN
ALMOST AS SOON AS THE POST BUDGET CHEERS DIE AWAY PUNDITS AND OPPONENTS BEGIN EXCAVATING THE SMALL PRINT LABOUR'S SHADOW LEADER OF THE COMMONS CHRIS BRYANT ACCUSED THE CHANCELLOR OF PUTTING TWO FINGERS UP TO VULNERABLE PEOPLE
THERE'S SOMETHING DEEPLY DISTASTEFUL TO MY MIND ABOUT A THREE THOUSAND POUND CUT PER PERSON FOR THEIR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHILST THE RICHEST GET A TWO HUNDRED AND TEN
SOME CONSERVATIVES ARE ALSO UNHAPPY AT THE CHANGES TO PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS WHICH ARE USED TO HELP PEOPLE LIVING WITH A DISABILITY OR LONG TERM HEALTH PROBLEM THE LEADER OF THE COMMONS CHRIS GRAYLING DIDN'T GO INTO ANY DETAILS
WE WILL PUBLISH DETAILS OF OUR PLANS ON THAT FRONT IN DUE COURSE AND OF COURSE ALL MOTIONS ARE PRODUCED SPEAK SPEAKER WITH AN IMPACT ASSESSMENTS
HE ONLY WENT A LITTLE FURTHER WHEN THE SUBJECT WAS RAISED AGAIN A FEW MINUTES LATER IT IS IMPORTANT FOR GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE SUPPORT WHERE IT'S NEEDED WHEN IT'S NEEDED BUT WE ALSO SAY TO GET THE BEST VALUE FOR TAXPAYERS' MONEY AND DELIVERING THAT'S HER
THE HOUSE OF LORDS HASN'T HAD MUCH OF A ROLE IN BUDGET DEBATE EVER SINCE THE FAMOUS ROW OVER THE SO CALLED PEOPLE'S BUDGET DELIVERED BY LLOYD GEORGE IN NINETEEN OH NINE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN PIERS CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSALS THIS WAS LABOUR'S LADY SHOW
I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED IN READING THE RED BOOK TO DISCOVER THAT THE SINGLE BIGGEST REVENUE RAISER IN THERE
WAS THE DECISION BY THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS OVER FIVE YEARS
BUYING A NEW DECISION TO TAKE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT AWAY FROM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO NEED TO GET DRESSED OR MANAGIN CONTINENTS THE WELFARE REFORM MINISTER LORD FREUD THOUGHT SHE AND OTHERS HAD GOT IT ALL WRONG
THERE'S A HUGE MISAPPREHENSION ABOUT THE COSTS OF PIP WHICH HAVE BEEN GOING UP RATHER THAN GOING DOWN THESE OR NOT
HE SAID THE COST OF THE PAYMENTS WAS APPROACHING TWELVE BILLION POUNDS SO WE ARE REDUCING A RAPID GROWTH
AND ADJUSTING
ADJUSTING HOW'LL WE GET TO PIP BECAUSE CLEARLY WE ARE GETTING MUCH HIGHER FIGURES THAN WAS ORIGINALLY EXPECTED
LAST NOVEMBER WHEN HE RESPONDED TO THE AUTUMN STATEMENT THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL READ OUT QUOTES FROM CHAIRMAN MAO'S LITTLE RED BOOK THIS TIME ROUND HE STUCK TO THE BUDGET RED BOOK PRODUCED BY THE TREASURY AS HE ENCOURAGED CONSERVATIVES TO REBEL OVER THOSE CHANGES TO PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS
I I ER DRAW MEMBERS NOW TO PRESS THE CHANCE TO THINK AGAIN ON THIS ISSUE
IT IS CRUEL AND IT IS UNFORTUNATELY I BELIEVE DANGEROUS FOR THEIR WELLBEING TO SAVOUR
THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN WHO REPLIED ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE CHANGES BUT SHE WASN'T IMPRESSED BY MISTER MACDONALD SPEECH LISTENING TO THE LABOUR PARTY SPEAKING ON ECONOMICS IT'S A BIT LIKE LISTENING TO THE ARSONIST RETURNING TO A SCENE OF THE HIS CRY IT'S A CONSTANT CRITICISM THAT THE FARM AND PUTTING OUT THE FIRE SWIFTLY
TO CORRECT THE MISTAKES THAT THEY HAVE MADE
FOR THE S.N.P. DOCTOR EILIDH WHITE FURRED COMPLAINED ABOUT WHAT SHE CALLED THE GUDDLE A SCOTTISH WORD FOR MESS OF MY OSBORNE'S PLANS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY SPENDING AS SHE ACCUSED HIM OF CACK HANDED ATTEMPTS TO SAVE MONEY
THERE ARE AROUND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE U.K. LIKE ME TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS NEW CUT AROUND FORTY THOUSAND OFF THEM IN SCOTLAND AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT COMES ON THE BACK OF A STRING OF AUSTERITY MEASURES ADVERSELY AFFECTING DISABLED PEOPLE ARE CONSERVATIVE NIGEL HUDDLESTONE INTERVENED
DOES SHE RECOGNISE AND ACCEPT DISABILITY SPENDING IS ACTUALLY GOING UP NOT BE MORE THAN A BILLION POUND SPENDING ON DISABILITY AND ISN'T IT APPROPRIATE THAT THE WELFARE SPENDING GOES TO THOSE IN MOST NEED
DOCTOR WHITE FOR HAD SAID THERE SHOULD BE MORE SCRUTINY OF THE FIGURES THE RICE IN THAT AMOUNT OF OVERALL BUDGET TO TWENTY TWENTY ON DISABILITY SPENDING AS VERY EASILY EXPLAINED BY THE
AS THE BABY BOOMER GENERATION START TO LOSE THEIR HEALTH AS A LIFE EXPECTANCY IS INCREASING BUT A HEALTHY LIFE EXPECTANCY IS NOT INCREASING AT THE SAME RATE THAT IS MORE DEMAND IT FOR DISABILITY SUPPORT
THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE CHANGES CONTINUED OUTSIDE THE DEBATING CHAMBER IN THE TELEVISION AND RADIO STUDIOS THE BUDGET DEBATE IN THE COMMONS WERE RESUME ON MONDAY
SEAN CURRAN REPORTING AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE AS USUAL AT HALF PAST EIGHT ON LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT TURNED TO SEVEN A YEAR AGO THIS MONTH PROTEST STARTED AT UNIVERSITIES ACROSS SOUTH AFRICA AND OF THE BALLET ROADS MUST FALL THEY WANTED TO PULL DOWN STATUES OF MEN LIKE CECIL RHODES WILL BE REGARDED AS WICKED IMPERIALISTS THE POSTERS
PROTESTS HAVE SPREAD TO THIS COUNTRY AS WELL NOW SOUTH AFRICAN STUDENTS ARE MAKING MORE DEMANDS IN SO I THINK THAT CUTS IN FEES AND CHANGES IN THE UNIVERSITY'S LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION IN A SERIES OF PROTESTS WHICH HAVE INCREASED RACIAL TENSION OUR WORLD AFFAIRS EDITOR JOHN SIMPSON REPORT FROM ONE OF SOUTH AFRICA'S TOP UNIVERSITIES STELLENBOSCH JUST OUTSIDE CAPE TOWN
THIS IS A STUNNING PLACE WHITE PAINTED RED TILED BUILDINGS IN THE DUTCH STYLE LOVELY OPEN CAMPUS STATUES OF OLD GRANDEES FROM THE PAST
SMALL GROUPS OF STUDENTS GATHERED AROUND TALKING AND LAUGHING
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING MOST OF THESE GROUPS UP EITHER JUST BLACK OR WHITE
THEY'RE NOT MIX TOGETHER THERE'S NOTHING AS WELL I IT'S LIKE STANDING IN THE SUNSHINE IS A SMALL GROUP OF ANIMATED BLACK STUDENTS CLUSTERED ROUND A PARTICULAR STUDENT
THE BEST WE HAVE GOT THE HEAVIER GEOFFREY CLUB UNO IS A THIRD YEAR THEOLOGY
HE'S ALSO A COMMITTED MEMBER OF THE RADICAL AND ANGRY ECONOMIC FREEDOM FIGHTER MANAGEMENT I DON'T HAVE WAIT FOR IT
THERE IT IS I DON'T HAVE WHITE FRIENDS THE FLED THEY WANT TO ADAPTED TO THE ART COLLEGE AND I'M NOT YET A DUB TODAY A CATCH OF COURSE MAKE A JASON AFRICAN COACH I BELONG TO SEE IT IS YOU'VE GOT THEM LEARNING SOMETHING ABOUT MAKE HOTEL YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT THEN I MUST LEND OUR COURAGE AND THIS ONE I THINK AND THEN THE MINUTE I'M SPEAKING ENGLISH AND WERE DOING WHAT I'M KUNLE AMAZING MOMENT EIGHTY THEY'RE FED THAT IN NOW I'M ADAPTING TO WHATSOEVER
GEOFFREY REPRESENTS A SMALL MINORITY OF BLACK STUDENTS HERE BUT HE'S INCREASINGLY INFLUENTIAL THIS IS A NEW GENERATION WHICH THINKS THE IDEA OF A RAINBOW NATION IT'S RUBBISH
AND THAT NELSON MANDELA WAS AN UNCLE TOM WHO SOLD OUT TO THE WHITE
STELLENBOSCH USED TO BE PRIMARILY AFRIKAANS SPEAKING THAT'S THE LANGUAGE OF THE MOSTLY DUTCH DESCENDED WHITES WHICH MANY BLACKS REGARD NOW AS THE TRUE LANGUAGE OF A PARTY
I WAS JUST TALKING TO A GROUP OF AFRIKAANS STUDENTS WHEN AN ANGRY BLACKS
BROKE IN ON THE CONVERSATION I MEAN I STUDY THE ACCOUNTING AND AFRICA VIOLENCE ANTON'S A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE DON'T SPEAK AFRIKAANS THEY DON'T SAY IN AFRICA ONE AND THERE'S A C. OFF THE LITTLE BUSH UNIVERSITY AS THIS LATER DISREGARD YOU SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE
IT'S NOT A LOT OF US ARE FISTY LISTENER RESIDENT EVEN YOU SAY JUST I KNOW THAT YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO BE EDUCATED AND METRES OF PUSH US PEOPLE WHO BUY WHY DON'T YOU GET A BLISTERING TO GIVE THEIR OWN OPINIONS ON HOW THEY FILL UP AT LANGUAGE BY THIS WEEK WE CAN HAVE OUR FRIENDS SPEAKING WHEN THERE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO WE EITHER AND A HOLY CILLA AND OUR HOLY TRINITY'S INSTITUTION I WAS FEELING A BIT ANNOYED
SO ON BOTH FOR ALLEGED AS INTERRUPTED EVERYTHING TEAMS TO BECOME A RACIAL ISSUE ON CAMPUS AND THAT'S ONE OF THAT'S LIKE A HUGE ISSUE BECAUSE EVERYTHING GETS INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF BLACK OR WHITE
WE'VE GONE MOVE BOSS HE CAN'T OVERCOME CERTAIN ISSUES WE CAN'T ACHIEVE CONSENSUS IF EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE TAKEN SO PERSONAL
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR WE HAVE SEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF RACISM BOTH WHITE AND BLACK AND INCREASING POLARISATION
THE UNIVERSITY IS RECTOR DOCTOR VILLAIN DE VILLIERS IS A CALM RATIONAL FIGURE WHO'S TRYING TO BALANCE ALL THE COMPETING STUDENT DEMANDS
HE'S ALREADY AGREED TO DOWNGRADE AFRIKAANS AS THE MAIN LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION SINCE BLACK STUDENTS DON'T USUALLY WANT IT ONE ASPECT THAT WE'VE A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON IS THAT YOUR THOUGHTS OF LIVE LISTEN
SO WE'VE STARTED THESE CLUSTERS WERE COMMUNITIES WE'LL SMALLER GROUPS OF STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS WOULD LIVE TOGETHER THAT'S REALLY A RESULTED IN VERY GOOD CONVERSATIONS VERY GOOD DISCUSSION FORUM
STELLENBOSCH IS STILL BEAUTIFUL STILL FULL OF HIGHLY ARTICULATE
BUT LIKE SOUTH AFRICA IN GENERAL IT'S STARTING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THEIR COUNTRY WE'VE KNOWN SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
WE'RE IN POST MANDELA TERRITORY NOW AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WHERE WE'RE HEADING
JOHN SIMPSON THERE IN STELLENBOSCH IT'S NOW FIVE TO SEVEN SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND A CLUSTER OF NINE STARS SO MASSIVE THAT EACH IS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TIMES BIGGER AND MILLIONS OF TIMES BRIGHTER THAN OUR SUN THERE IDENTIFIED USING THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE PROFESSOR PAUL CROWD THERE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD LED THE TEAM WHO MADE THE DISCOVERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SARAH AND YOU WERE ABLE TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE EFFECTIVELY NOT POLLUTED BY A LIGHT IT'S ADDING UP
THAT'S RIGHT THESE ARE THE KIND OF RAREST AND THE MOST EXTREME TYPES OF STAR THERE AS IT IS HE SAID THEY ARE MILLIONS OF TIMES BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN THE INCREDIBLY HOT WHICH MEANS EMITTING LOTS OF ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT AND OF COURSE BUT THAT ULTIMATE LIGHT CAN'T BE SEEN DIRECTLY FROM THE GROUNDS WE'VE GOT TO GO INTO ORBIT HUBBLE TELESCOPE COULD ACTUALLY DO THIS
ULTRAVIOLET VIEW SO IT'S PART IN FACT WE HAVE TO GO INTO SPACE AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE HOBBS GOT SUCH EXQUISITE VIEW IT'S WAS IT A VISION TO BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH IS VERY VERY CLOSELY SEPARATED STARS IN THIS DISTANT GALAXY
WHICH IS KIND OF UNIQUE PROPERTY OF BARBEL TELESCOPE NOW THEY BURN SO MUCH BRIGHTER BUT THEY DON'T LAST AS LONG
THAT'S RIGHT SO THAT THE STARS WHICH WHICH EACH WEIGH ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE THAN THE SUN THESE HAVE LIFETIMES OF ONLY A FEW MILLION YEARS AND OF COURSE THE SUN LIVES FOR ABOUT TEN BILLION YEARS SO A TINY FRACTION OF OUR SON'S LIFE WHAT CAN THEY TELL US BUT VIED KNOWING OF THEIR EXISTENCE WHAT WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP
WELL THAT THAT IF YOU REMEMBER RECENTLY THE DISCOVERY ACCREDITATION OR WAVES AND THIS WAS A PAIR OF BLACK HOLES MASSIVE BLACK HOLES WHICH MERGED TO PRODUCE THE KIND A GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SIGNATURE AND THESE VERY MASSIVE STARS WE THINK WILL ALSO PRODUCE BLACK HOLES AND IF THEY'RE IN A PAIR OF STARS PER SYSTEMS THEY WILL ACTUALLY THEN ULTIMATELY MERGED AND ALSO GIVE OFF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES TOO
AND SAID BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT GONNA HAPPEN FOR SOME TIME NO NO IT'S NOT NO BUT WE DO THESE THESE ARE THINGS WHICH ACTUALLY DOMINATE THE KIND OF ENERGETIC SS IN GALAXIES LIKE OUR OWN MILKY WAY
EVEN THOUGH THE VERY RARE WHAT THEY DO DO IS IS THEY GIVE OFF THIS AUTOPILOT RADIATION WHICH WHICH COLOUR MOVES GAS AROUND ENOUGH CAN TRIGGER NEW STUFF A MENTION O.K. SO NOW THAT WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WE CAN TRY TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO INTO WHAT THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE
AND AND IT ACTUALLY IN THE ENTIRE MILKY WAY WE THINK THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL OF THESE ARE THESE SUPER BRIGHT STARS AND IF I'M FAT IN THIS TINY PART OF THIS THE SATELLITE GALAXY THE LARGE MUCH THE CLOUDS THERE ARE MORE WE THINKING ISN'T THIS TINY REGION THAN THERE ARE IN THE ENTIRE MILKY WAY WELL DONE FOR FINDING THEM PROFESSOR PAUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WHAT ELSE IS UP THERE IN TERMS OF THE WEATHER THAT IS
WE'VE STILL GOT HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATING OUR WEATHER SO A LOT OF DRY WEATHER IN THE FORECAST A COOLER AND CLOUDIER DAY TODAY THAN YESTERDAY YESTERDAY WAS THE WARMEST DAY OF THE YEAR SO FAR PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TODAY THE SUNSHINE WILL BE FOR WESTERN PARTS OF THE U.K. WAS FURTHER EAST WE'VE GOT RATHER MORE CLOUD SO FOR THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS EASTERN ENGLAND NORTH EAST ENGLAND EASTERN SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN SCOTLAND
THIS SIGN IS DOMINATED BY SOME LOW CLOUD THAT'S BEEN ROLLING IN OFF THE NORTH SEA SO BIT OF A GREY AND MURKY MORNING TO COME SOME MIST AND HILL FOG AROUND TOO IT WILL GRADUALLY BRIGHTEN UP A LITTLE AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE DAY BUT REMAINING VERY COOL UNDER THAT CLOUD WITH TEMPERATURES IN NEWCASTLE JUST FIVE DEGREES AND SEVEN CELSIUS IN BIRMINGHAM THE WEST FOR THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WALES NORTH WEST ENGLAND SOUTH WEST SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND
HERE IT'S A CHILLY START TO THE DAY WITH A LITTLE BIT OF FROST AND SOME ISOLATED POCKETS OF FOG TOO THEY SHOULD CLEAR AWAY QUICKLY LEAVING BLUE SKIES AND SUNSHINE LASTING ALL DAY FEELING REASONABLY WARM IN THAT SUNSHINE AROUND ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN FOR MOST OF US THAT WE COULD SEE TEMPERATURES UP AS HIGH AS FIFTEEN DEGREES FOR THE WEST OF SCOTLAND
WHAT ABOUT THE WEEKEND NO GREAT CHANGES HIGH PRESSURE STILL WITH US SO THINGS ARE LOOKING MAINLY DRY IF NOT CLOUDY AND RATHER COOL PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTH AND THE EAST WHERE WILL HAVE A COOL BREEZE FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK
SARAH THANKS VERY MUCH NOW HERE'S DOCTOR THE JONES TO TELL US ABOUT HER PROGRAMME THIS MORNING ON RADIO FOUR ON EASTER MONDAY NINETEEN SIXTEEN A SMALL GROUP OF ARMED MEN AND WOMEN
POETS TEACHERS ACTORS SOCIALIST NATIONALIST RADICALS SEIZED CONTROL OF WARTIME DUBHLAN
THEIR BID TO OVERTHROW BRITISH RULE ENDED IN BLOODY FARIA BUT SPARKED A NEW WAVE OF SUPPORT FOR IRISH SEPARATISM THAT WOULD LEAD TO MOST OF OUR ISLAND LEAVING THE UNITED KINGDOM
WHY DID THIS FAILED UPRISING HAVE SUCH A PROFOUND IMPACT AND HOW DO WE SEE IT DIFFERENTLY TODAY IN BOTH BRITAIN AND IRELAND
JOIN ME HEATHER JONES THIS MORNING AT ELEVEN LATER ON THIS PROGRAMME THE CRISIS OF THE POLITICAL CRISIS IN BRAZIL AND WHY BEN NEVIS IS HIGHER THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY WERE JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE

THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS MEETING IN BRUSSELS HAVE AGREED TO SUPPORT THE CONTROVERSIAL PLAN TO TACKLE THE REFUGEE CRISIS BY SENDING ALL MIGRANTS WHO REACH GREECE BACK TO TURKEY BUT THERE WILL BE FEWER CONCESSIONS THAN THE TURKS WANTED AND MORE LEGAL SAFEGUARDS FOR THE MIGRANTS THE DRAFT WILL BE PUT TO THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER IN BRUSSELS THIS MORNING THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGLER MERKEL INSISTED THE NEGOTIATIONS WOULD NOT BE EASY FRANCE'S PRESIDENT OF SAID SUCCESS COULD NOT BE GUARANTEED

MEMBERSHIP HE'D OR FORGIVING TURKISH CITIZENS VISA FREE TRAVEL TO THE SHANNON AREA WOULD HAVE TO BE MET IN FULL
LEGAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED DEAL TO RETURN ALL IRREGULAR MIGRANTS FROM THE GREEK ISLANDS TO TURKEY HAVE ALSO BEEN DISCUSSED IN DETAIL
SEVERAL E.U. COUNTRIES ARE WORRIED ABOUT HER LACK OF CLARITY IN THE WAY TURKEY SAYS IT WOULD MEET ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS TO LOOK AFTER ALL REFUGEES SO THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT A WORKABLE DEAL CAN BE DONE LATER TODAY THERE'S ALSO THE PROSPECT OF HUGE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES AHEAD GREECE IS ALREADY STRUGGLING TO COPE AND IT SAYS IT WOULD NEED THE HELP OF SEVERAL THOUSAND OFFICIALS FROM ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE TO SET UP A FUNCTIONING ASYLUM SYSTEM ON THE GREEK ISLANDS IN A MATTER OF DAYS

AUTISM AFFECTS AROUND ONE PERCENT OF THE U.K. POPULATION OR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IT CAUSES DIFFICULTIES AND HOW THEY COMMUNICATE AND RELATE TO OTHERS THE REPORT BY AUTISTIC OR DRAWERS ON RECENTLY PUBLISHED DATA FROM A LARGE STUDY IN SWEDEN WHICH THE CHARITY SAYS IS COMPARABLE TO THE U.K.'S SITUATION THE FIGURES SHOW PEOPLE WITH AUTISM DYING AT AN AVERAGE AGE OF FIFTY FOUR RATHER THAN SEVENTY
AUTISTIC ADULTS WHO ALSO HAD LEARNING DIFFICULTIES WERE LIKELY TO DIE EVEN EARLIER WITH EPILEPTIC SEIZURES BEING THE MOST COMMON CAUSE FOR THOSE WITHOUT LEARNING DIFFICULTIES HEART DISEASE AND SUICIDE WERE SIGNIFICANT CAUSES OF DEATH THE CHARITY IS CALLING FOR RESEARCH TO SHED MORE LIGHT ON THESE FINDINGS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAYS IT'S ALREADY INCREASING CANCER SCREENING AND OTHER CHECKS FOR PEOPLE WITH AUTISM
THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY BE RE THINKING PROPOSALS TO RESTRICT SOME BENEFIT PAYMENTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHICH IS SAID TO BE OPPOSED BY SCORES OF BACK BENCH CONSERVATIVES MINISTERS ARGUE THAT THEY NEED TO TIGHTEN THE CRITERIA FOR THE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS TO MAKE SURE THE CASH IS BETTER TARGETED HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ELEMER

THE CONSERVATIVE BACKBENCH REBELLION IS BEING LED BY ANDREW PERCY WHO SAID SCORES OF HIS FELLOW TORY M.P.S HAD EITHER EXPRESS CONCERN OR SIGNED A LETTER TO THE CHANCELLOR CALLING FOR A RE THINK ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT CLEAR WHO HAS PUT THEIR NAME TO MISTER PERCY'S LETTER THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. DAVID BURROWS LAST NIGHT CALLED THE PROPOSALS A BACKWARD STEP AND URGED MINISTERS TO PRESS PAUSE
FIGURES SEEN BY THE B.B.C. SHOW THAT SPENDING ON HEALTH AND EDUCATION WILL BE SQUEEZED BY MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS BECAUSE OF CHANGES TO PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS EMPLOYERS SUCH AS N.H.S. TRUSTS AND SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE MORE TO STAFF PENSIONS IN THREE YEARS' TIME HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT VICKI
MISTER OSBORNE SAYS THIS CHANGE TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION SCHEME IS NEEDED TO KEEP IT SUSTAINABLE THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS SAY THE MOVE WILL TAKE MONEY FROM FRONTLINE SERVICES FIGURES FROM THE INDEPENDENT HOUSE OF COMMONS LIBRARY OBTAINED BY THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS SHOW THAT THE N.H.S. WILL HAVE TO FIND AN ESTIMATED SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION POUNDS A YEAR
THE CHANGES WILL ALSO SEE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS FOR TEACHERS RISE BY MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS THE HEALTH AND SCHOOLS BUDGETS ARE PROTECTED BUT BOTH ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE AND THIS DECISION WILL ADD TO THE STRAIN THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER TIM FARRON SAID MISTER OSBORN HAD MADE GRAND PROMISES ABOUT FUNDING THE N.H.S. AND WAS NOW MAKING SECRET CUTS BY THE BACK DOOR
TREASURY OFFICIALS SAID THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR DEPARTMENTS BUT THEY HAD BEEN AWARE THE CHANGES WERE COMING
TRAIN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN TOLD TO DO MORE TO ENCOURAGE PASSENGERS TO CLAIM COMPENSATION FOR DELAYED TRAINS MOST COMPANIES WILL REFUND HALF THE TICKET PRICE FOR A THIRTY MINUTE HOLD UP AT THE FULL PRICE IF YOU'RE AN HOUR LATE BUT THE RAIL REGULATOR FOUND THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO'D EXPERIENCED TODAY'S FAILED TO MAKE A CLAIM ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE JOANNA WHITTINGTON SAYS OPERATORS NEED TO BE A LOT CLEARER
WE THINK THERE CAN BE IMPROVEMENT TO AWARENESS MIKE'S PASSENGERS OF THE COMPENSATION THERE ARE ENTITLED TO AND CLAIMS PROCESS THEY SHOULD FOLLOW WE THINK THEY'RE SOME CHANGES YOU CAN MAKE TO THE PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE
SIMPLIFYING WEBSITES MAKING SURE IT BUT IT'S REALLY CLEAR WHERE YOU CAN CLAIM COMPENSATION WHERE THE FOUR METRES AND THEN FINALLY WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE AT FRAMEWORK TO MONITOR HER TRAIN OPERATOR PERFORMANCE SO THAT WE CAN REPORT BACK ON THE PROGRESS THEY'VE MADE
THE UNITED STATES SAYS NORTH KOREA HAS FIRED TO BALLISTIC MISSILES IN DEFIANCE OF INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS ON OF THE ROCKETS IS BELIEVED TO HAVE FLOWN ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES BEFORE CRASHING INTO THE SEA IT'S THOUGHT THE OTHER MAY HAVE DISINTEGRATED IN MID AIR IT'S THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF WEAPONS TESTS CARRIED OUT BY NORTH KOREA
POLICE IN BRAZIL HAVE FIRE TEAR GAS AND STUN GRENADES TO KEEP PROTESTERS AWAY FROM THE HEADQUARTERS OF PRESIDENT YOUR MURDEROUS SETH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DEMANDING HER RESIGNATION RALLIED IN THE CAPITAL BRASILIA THEY ACCUSE HER OF CORRUPTION
AN INVASIVE CATERPILLAR THAT RAPIDLY DEVOURS BOX PLANTS HAS BEEN NAMED THE TOP PEST OF TWENTY FIFTEEN BY THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY THE BOX TREE CATERPILLAR IS NATIVE TO ASIA AND WAS FIRST FOUND IN THE U.K. IN TWENTY ELEVEN IT'S NOW SPREADING ACROSS SOUTH EAST ENGLAND CLAIRE MARSHALL REPORTS
THE GLUTTON IF BOOKS TREE CATERPILLAR CAN KILL A BOX PLANT WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF HATCHING IT'S DIFFICULT TO SPOT UNTIL IT'S ALREADY STARTED TO DESTROY ITS HOST PLANT DEVOURING IT FROM THE INSIDE OUT
THE CATERPILLAR SPINS A FINE WEBBING TO HIDE BEHIND THAT TURNS BOX TOPIARY AND HEDGING GHOSTLY WHITE
BUT BY THE TIME THE SILK LIKE FIBRES CAN BE SEEN THE PLANT WILL BE MOSTLY DEAD IT PROMPTED THE MOST CALLS FROM CONCERNED GARDENS TO THE R.H.S. GARDENING TEAM LAST YEAR THIS PUTS IT AT THE TOP OF THEIR PEST LIST KNOCKING OFF SLOWCOACH SLUGS AND SNAILS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE OTHER RUNNERS UP INCLUDE APHIDS LARGE CABBAGE WHITE BUTTERFLIES AND VINE WEEVILS
A CLUSTER OF NINE MONSTER STARS EACH WITH THE MASS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TIMES THAT OF THE SUN HAS BEEN FOUND BY AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM OF SCIENTISTS USING THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE THE NEWLY IDENTIFIED STARS ARE ASTONISHINGLY BRIGHT TOGETHER THEY OUTS OUTSHINE THE SUN BY A FACTOR OF THIRTY MILLION THEY LIE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND LIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM THE EARTH
NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WE'RE OFTEN TOLD IT COSTS MORE TO KEEP SOMEONE IN PRISON THAN IN ETON COS EVEN MORE TO KEEP SOMEONE WHO IS MENTALLY ILL IN A SECURE HOSPITAL AND THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH BEDS AVAILABLE THAT'S WHAT THE SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY LORD FALCONER FORMER LORD CHANCELLOR SAYS AND HE IS WITH ME AND WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO IN THE OLD LANGUAGE OF CRIMINALLY INSANE ALL CORRECT THAT'S RIGHT WHO'VE COMMITTED CRIMES ROSS CRIMINALLY INSANE
OR HAVE GONE INSANE WHILST IN PRISON ARE YOU COULD YOU LATER I THINK SUCH A BURGER IS ABOUT WHAT AT THE HOSPITAL YES HOSPITAL WHERE YOU DO HE WAS GIVEN A MEDIUM SECURE PRISON HAVE COMMITTED TERRIBLE CRIMES BUT
VERY CLOSELY MONITORED AFTER THEY'VE SERVED THEIR PUNISHMENT THEY ARE GRADUALLY ALLOWED INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THE RESULTS BUT THAT HOSPITAL HAS GOT IN TERMS OF REDUCING RE OFFENDING IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND WE NEED MORE OF THAT BECAUSE CURRENTLY THE PRISON'S A FOOL
VERY MANY PEOPLE IN THE PRISONS HAVE MENTAL ILLNESSES THE PRISONS AREN'T ABLE TO COPE THEY'RE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MENTAL PROBLEMS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN PRISONS LEGAL HIGHS WHICH IS MAKING PEOPLE EVEN MORE INSANE AND IN NEED OF HELP AND THE HELP IS NOT THERE AND THAT IS BAD FOR SOCIETY BECAUSE IT INCREASES RE OFFENDING WHY ISN'T THE SOLUTION THEN SIMPLY TO HAVE MORE SIMPLY TO HAVE BECAUSE IT COST MONEY BUT I HAVE MORE PRISONERS AND BETTER CARE IN THOSE PRISONS RATHER
RUN MANY VERY VERY EXPENSIVE SECURE HOSPITALS BECAUSE VERY MANY PEOPLE WHO COMMIT CRIMES ARE MENTALLY ILL BEFORE THEY GET TO PRISON YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR DISH I'VE NEVER BEEN IN PRISON IN THE FIRST PLACE
SOME OF THEM COMMIT SUCH CRIMES THAT THEY DO NEED TO BE IMPRISONED THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME PENNIES WE LOCKED UP YES THEY NEED TO BE LOCKED UP AND YOU NEED AS WELL TO THINK ABOUT WHAT VICTIMS OF THOSE CRIMES THINK SOCIETY SHOULD DO BUT WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT WHETHER YOU WISH TO REDUCE RE OFFENDING AND PROVIDE MORE PROTECTION FOR SOCIETY THEN THEY NEED INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS IN THE BETHLEM HOSPITAL IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT
THAT THE PROBLEMS IN PRISONS AT THE MOMENT I'M GETTING MORE AND MORE INTENSE AND IN THE BUDGET THAT MISTER OSBORNE ANNOUNCED EARLIER IN THIS WEEK HE IS REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT EMMA JAY HAS
BY A BILLION JUST WITH THE MINISTER JUST A MILLION POUNDS A BILLION A BILLION GOT A MILLION A BILLION POUNDS AND THIS IS IN THE CONTEXT OF ALREADY OVERCROWDED PRISONS
MY GIRL AND HE'S RIGHT TO SAY THIS SAYS WE NEED A NEW APPROACH TO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH PEOPLE IN PRISON YOU COULD NEVER DO THAT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DECREASE THE PRISON POPULATION OR INCREASED EXPENDITURE ON INTERVENTION OF PEOPLE ARE IMPRISONED POLITICALLY DIFFICULT TO FIND MONEY FOR THAT WHEN YOU'RE CUTTING SAY DISABILITY BENEFITS OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE US NOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU CAN GO ON THE STUMP AND SAY WHILE WE'RE GOING TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON
SECURE HOSPITALS THE THEME TO FOCUS ON THE RELATION TO THIS IS REDUCING RE OFFENDING AND ALTHOUGH YOU WILL HAVE TO SPEND MONEY TO START WITH THAT MONEY WILL PRODUCE RESULTS DOWN THE LINE AS A RE OFFENDING GOES DOWN THAT'S ALWAYS THE DIFFICULT THING FOR POLITICIANS AND SPEND MONEY NOW SAVE IT LATER BUT IF YOU
YOU CAN SEE FOR EXAMPLE IN RELATION TO THE PRISON EDUCATION BUDGET WHICH WENT UP
BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND RE OFFENDING WENT DOWN IT'S GONE DOWN PROPORTIONATE TO THE NUMBER OF PRISONERS AND RE OFFENDING IN PRISONERS HAS GONE I DO WE PUT SO MANY PEOPLE IN
BUT WE PUT SO MANY PEOPLE IN JAIL PARTLY BECAUSE WE PUT PEOPLE ON REMAND BEFORE THEY ARE CONVICTED AND THEN A QUARTER THEM DON'T GO TO PRISON AT THEIR CENTRES THEY GET THE END WE SEND PEOPLE TO PRISON BECAUSE SOME SENTENCES NOT A RELATION TO VIOLENT OR SEXUAL CRIME BUT OTHER CRIMES ARE TOO LONG AND BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A WHOLE WE'VE GOT OVER
FOUR AND A HALF THOUSAND PRISONERS WERE AN INDETERMINATE PUBLIC PROTECTION SENTENCES WHO CAN'T GET OUT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THEIR COURSES THOSE ARE THE THREE MAIN REASONS OUR PRISON POPULATION SO LARGE AT THE MOMENT NOT WALKER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS THIRTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN HE POSSIBLE BRECK THICK ABOUT AHEAD WE'LL GET MORE OF THE VIEWS OF U.K. BUSINESS FROM TANYA BECKETT ON THAT YES WITH THE INSECURITY GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD HELP STIMULATE BRITAIN TO IMPROVE ITS STATURE IN THE WORLD BUT THIS IS THE VIEW OF THE CO FOUNDER OF THE BRISTOL BASED FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM HARGREAVES LAMB DOWN PETER HARGREAVES AND OF COURSE THOSE OPPOSING ANY SUCH BRECHT'S IT SUCH AS THE STRONGER IN CAMPAIGN SAY
LEAVING THE E.U. WILL PUT JOBS AND GROWTH AT STAKE BUT I ASKED PETER HARGREAVES WHAT DOES HE THINK THE COMPELLING REASON IS FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U.
I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT THE E.U.
DOES NOTHING MORE THAN MAKE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE THE REGULATION AND LEGISLATION IS REALLY VERY VERY CUMBERSOME BUT IT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO TRADE WITH EACH OTHER FREELY THAT CANNOT BE DESCRIBED AS MAKING LIFE MORE DIFFICULT SURELY NO NO I'M VERY PROUD A FREE TRADE AREA IN FACT I DID VOTE FOR A FREE TRADE AREA AND THAT'S WHAT THE COMMON MARKET STARTED OUT AS IT WAS CALLED THE COMMON MARKET FOR THAT REASON
BUT WE DIDN'T BELIEVE AT THAT TIME WE WERE GOING TO GET POLITICAL UNION A FREE TRADE AREA IS MARVELLOUS AND I DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULDN'T HAVE A FREE TRADE AREA IF WE LEFT YOU YOU ARE VERY CONVINCED THEM THAT IF BRITAIN LEFT THE E.U. THAT WE WOULD VERY QUICKLY BE IN A POSITION TO REPLICATE THE TRADE DEAL THAT WE HAD WITH THE E.U. TWENTY SOMETIMES OVER GUARANTEED WHY ARE YOU SO CONVINCED WELL CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THEY PUT UP A TREAD BARRIER
AND WE WOULD RECIPROCATE IMMEDIATELY JUST IMAGINE THE THREE PHONE CALLS AND HER MIRACLE WILL GET THE FOLLOWING DAY FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE THE EDGY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE MERCEDES AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE B.M.W. AND INDY BUT THESE TAKE TIME TO ESTABLISH AND THAT IS THE CONCERN IS THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE INTERVENING PERIOD OH NO IN THE INTERIM PERIOD THERE WOULDN'T BE TIME TO HAVE TRADE BARRIERS PUT UP WE WOULD CONTINUE AS WE WERE BEFORE WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD DO TO OUR ABILITY TO STRIKE TRADE DEALS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES I THINK IN CHINA AND INDIA FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WERE NOT PART OF THE YOU SURELY TRYING TO BROKER THESE DEALS AS PART OF A LARGER BLOCK IS AN EASIER THING TO ACHIEVE NO ABSOLUTELY NOT WHEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ARE PART OF A LARGE BLOCK YOU'VE TWENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES INPUT INTO ENTER INTO THE NEGOTIATIONS WHEN YOU NEGOTIATING ON YOUR OWN YOU'VE ONLY ONE COUNTRY TO PUT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS YOU CAN SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH THE CHINESE DELEGATION AND DECIDE WHAT HE'S GOING TO BE WHEREAS WHEREAS IN EUROPE
THEY SIT DOWN WITH THE CHINESE DELEGATION THEN THEY HAVE TO GO BACK TO TWENTY EIGHT COUNTRIES AND ASK THEM WHAT THEY THINK AND THEY ALL THEY ALL WANT TO MAKE AMENDMENTS NOTHING EVER DUTCH DUMB I MEAN THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS STEEL DUMPING IN THE U.K. AND THE WHOLE OF EUROPE BECAUSE ACTUALLY WITH THE THE BUREAUCRATS IN BRUSSELS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY AGREEMENT NOW WE STOP DUMPING OF STEEL THAT'S WHY WE'RE CLOSING I STEEL MILLS
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO STOP TRADING WITH US BECAUSE THEY SELL US MORE THAN WE SELL THEM PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHEN WE LEAVE WELL
VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE EXCEPT WE WILL HAVE MORE FREEDOM AND I THINK WE WILL DO WELL IN TALKING BACK TO THE COMMONWEALTH LOOK AT LOOKING AT ALL THE NEW EMERGING MARKETS EUROPE WHY WHY WOULD THE COMMONWEALTH BEEN AN OBVIOUS PLACE TO LOOK BECAUSE THEY SPEAK ENGLISH FOR A START BUT WHY HADN'T IF THAT WAS THE CASE THEN WHY WOULD BRITAIN NOT RE FOCUSES EFFORTS THERE ANYWAY
WELL AGAIN WHEN WE TRADING WITH THE COMMONWEALTH WE WE STILL HAVE TO BRUSSELS FOR SETTING OUT THE FRAMEWORK AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE BE ALLOWED TO SET OUT THAT FRAMEWORK AND YOU FEEL THAT COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES WOULD BE RECEPTIVE TO THAT CORRECT HOW WOULD BRITAIN IN TERMS OF TRADE HOW DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE JUST OUTSIDE THE E.U. IN THE NEXT DECADE OR SO
WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT BUT CERTAINLY THERE IS THERE IS IT REMAND FOR THINGS THAT YOU BRITISH WE DO WELL WITH OUR FASHION BRANDS AND MEAN I KNOW I KNOW MOST THE CAR MANUFACTURERS HERE ARE NOT OWNED IN BRITAIN BUT PEOPLE COVERT RANGE ROVERS ROLLS ROYCE'S BENTLEYS AND JAGUAR AND SO THOSE WILL STILL DO WELL AND DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THAT THEY'RE NOT OWNED BY BY BY A BRITISH FORWARD HAS ALWAYS BEEN BUILT HERE AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN OWNED BY THE AMERICANS
THE CO FOUNDER OF HARGREAVES LANSDOWN PETER HARGREAVES
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TELL ME OF THE TIME IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN PEOPLE WITH AUTISM HAVE MUCH SHORTER LIVES THAN THE REST OF THE POPULATION THAT'S WHAT THE STATISTICS SHOWN IT AMOUNTS TO AN ENORMOUS HIDDEN CRISIS ACCORDING TO THE AUTISM CHARITY AUTISTIC AT ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE JOHN SPIERS IS WITH ME ON THE LINE IS SALLY LAWRENCE WHO'S THE MOTHER OF A CHILD
WITH AUTISM AND EPILEPSY MISSUS LODGE GOOD GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT HIM AND HIS STATE OF HEALTH THE PART FROM THE AUTISM
MY SON SIMON IS TWENTY THREE NOW HE'S HEALTHY APART FROM THE AUTISM AND THE EPILEPSY HE IS WELL LOOKED AFTER IN A SPECIALIST
YOUNG ADULT PROVISION RESIDENTIAL PLACE A RESIDENTIAL PLACE YES WE LIVE IN SURREY BUT THERE WAS NOTHING IN SURREY FOR HIM SO HE'S BEEN OUT OF COUNTY SINCE HE WAS EIGHT AND HE HAS TWO YEARS LEFT AT THIS PLACE BECAUSE HE HAS TO LEAVE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE THEN WHAT HAPPENED
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND IF WE DID NOTHING ABOUT IT HE WOULD PROBABLY BE SENT TO YORKSHIRE WHICH IS WHERE PETE THERE ARE THERE IS GOOD PROVISION AND WE DON'T WANT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE OTHER AND YOU HAVE THE COUNTRY FROM WHERE WE LIVE AND WE FEEL THAT'S TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE SO WE MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE ACTUALLY SET UP A CHARITY CALLED THE SIMON TRUST TO HELP SURREY COUNTY COUNCIL PROVIDE HOMES IN SURREY FOR MY SON AND NINE OTHERS LIKE HIM SO THEY CAN BE NEAR THEIR FAMILIES BUT WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT AS WE ALL GET OLDER WE NEED TO BE NEAR THEM AND THEY NEED TO BE
BUT NEAR A SORT OF COURSE COMPLETELY UNSELLABLE BUT YOU SAY HE IS PHYSICALLY GOOD HEALTH WHY DO YOU THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING
BUT TO TWO PEOPLE WITH AUTISM IN YOUR EXPERIENCE OF OF SIMON THE OTHER EXPERIENCE YOU HAD IN THIS AREA THAT MIGHT CAUSE THEM TO DIE EARLIER
THAT WAS A HORRIFIC STATEMENT THAT I A STATISTIC THAT WE HEARD YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF DEATH FOR PEOPLE WITH AUTISM IS THIRTY NINE I MEAN THAT WAS A BIG SHOCK TO ME I KNOW SO MANY DIE EARLY BECAUSE OF THE EPILEPSY AND
THEY JUST NEED BETTER SPECIALIST CARE PEOPLE NEED TO BE LOOKING AFTER THEM WHO UNDERSTAND HOW TO DEAL WITH A SEIZURE AND NEED TO GET THEM TO MEDICAL
HELP WHEN NECESSARY THEY SHOULDN'T DIE AT THIRTY NINE THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT THEY JUST NEED TO BE WELL LOOKED AFTER WELL MANAGED AND LIVE A NORMAL HAPPY LIFE THE SAME AS ANYONE ELSE DESERVES AND AT THE MOMENT SIMON HE'S HAVING
WELL I'M NOT A NORMAL LIFE CLEARLY BUT PUT A HAPPY LIFE YOU THINK YES HE HAS NO SPEECH SO YOU CAN'T TELL US IF HE'S HAPPY OR NOT BUT WE TAKE HIM OUT AT THE WEEKENDS FROM WHERE HE IS IN THIS RESIDENTIAL CARE HOME AND HE'S ALWAYS HAPPY TO GO BACK IN AND THAT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO US
BECAUSE THAT'S A WAY OF KNOWING THAT HE IS HAPPY AND THE STAFF ARE JUST AMAZING BUT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE IN THAT MANY CARE HOMES DON'T PAY THEIR STAFF ENOUGH THEY DON'T TRAIN THEM WELL ENOUGH AND YOU HEAR HORRIFIC STORIES OF WHAT GOES WRONG WHEN
THEY DO GET THE WRONG CARE PROVISION SO WHEN WE SET UP THIS CARE HOME IN SURREY WHICH WE'RE HOPING TO WHICH WE ARE WORKING TO DO WITH ON WITH SURREY COUNTY COUNCIL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT CARE IS THERE AND THAT THE CARE STAFF ARE TRAINED WELL ENOUGH AND PAID WELL ENOUGH AND THEN
IT SHOULD WORK WELL AND SIMON AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD LIVE A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE WELL LET LET'S HOPE THAT DOES HAPPEN AND JOHN SPIERS THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE ISN'T IT
WHY SOME PEOPLE AT THE SEVERE END OF THE AUTISM SCALE ON THE SEVERE END OF THE SCALE DI ONLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING PROPER CARE WELL IN ALL HONESTY WE SIMPLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PREMATURE DEATH IS SUCH A HUGE PROBLEM IN AUTISM THE RESEARCH DOESN'T EXIST AND THERE'S A HUGE NEED FOR VERY MUCH INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH
WE HAVE SOME INDICATIONS FROM THE STUDIES THAT WE'VE INCLUDED IN A REPORT THAT CAME OUT THIS MORNING SO WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE EPILEPSY IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH ALL ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY SO THAT THERE ARE STRONG SCIENTIFIC INDICATIONS THAT THE EPILEPSY WE SEE IN AUTISTIC INDIVIDUALS MAY BE DIFFERENT BIOLOGICALLY FROM THE EPILEPSY THAT WE SEE IN THE IN THE NOVEL POPULATED YEAH WE DON'T UNDERSTAND NECESSARILY WHY THAT IS BUT THERE ARE INDICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE EPILEPSY YOU SEE AN AUTISTIC PEOPLE BEGINS LATER IN LIFE
WHICH IS UNUSUAL TO SEE IT SEEMS TO BE LESS LESS EFFECTIVELY TREATED WITH WITH THE STANDARD MEDICATIONS THAT WE HAVE AND ALSO ONE OF THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT CAUSES OF DEATH THAT REPORTED SUICIDE SO FOR THOSE WHO HAVE AUTISM BUT NO LEARNING DISABILITY SUICIDE IS ONE OF THE VERY SIGNIFICANT CAUSES OF DEATH AND AGAIN THAT'S SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL FOR EXAMPLE WOMEN WITH AUTISM ARE ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO CONSIDER AND COMMIT SUICIDE THAN MEN WITH ALTHOUGH THAT'S HOW MANY MORE MEN
AND WOMEN THAT'S RIGHT MANY MORE MEN HAVE A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM I THINK THE SCIENTIFIC OPINION AND THAT IS STILL EVOLVING WHETHER OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT MORE MEN THAN WOMEN HAVE AUTISM IT'S NOT YET CLEAR CERTAINLY MORE MEN HAVE A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM YES BUT I THINK WE HAVE WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN VERY POOR AT DIAGNOSING WOMEN WITH AUTISM WOMEN MANIFEST DIFFERENTLY WITH THE AUTISM THAT THEY HAVE THE PRESENTS DIFFERENTLY THEY HAVE DIFFERENT COPING STRATEGIES AND THAT MEANS THAT THE THE DIAGNOSTICS WE HAVE ARE NOT NECESSARILY OPTIMISED TO PICK UP AUTISTIC WOMEN AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
ONE PERSON IN ONE HUNDRED HAS AUTISM OR HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM ONE HAS IN ANDREW HAS AUTISM THEY WON'T ALL BE DIAGNOSED AND THERE'S A PARTICULAR ISSUE WITH ADULTS SO WE ARE GETTING A LOT BETTER AT DIAGNOSING AUTISM IN CHILDREN BUT WE HAVE A HUGE LONG TAIL OF ADULTS WHO WERE TWO WERE BORN BEFORE THE TIME THAT WE BECAME FAIRLY ADEPT AT DIAGNOSING AUTISM WHO ARE NOW PERHAPS BEING DIAGNOSED IN THEIR FORTIES FIFTIES SIXTIES
AND ONE OF THE HUGE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IS THERE IS BARELY ANY RESEARCH DONE INTO OLDER PEOPLE WITH AUTISM SO THE BULK OF RESEARCH IS DONE IN CHILDREN AND THAT MEANS WE UNDERSTAND REALLY VERY LITTLE ABOUT HOW AND WHY AND WHEN AUTISTIC PEOPLE ARE DYING SO THERE IS THERE IS AN ENORMOUS NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED JOHN SPIERS CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF AUTISTIC SALLY LAWRENCE THANK YOU BOOKS OF THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN LATE LAST NIGHT ARE YOU LEADERS AGREED A PROPOSAL THAT THEY WILL BE PUTTING TO TURKEY'S PRIME MINISTER THIS MORNING TO TRY TO END THE MASS MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE TO EUROPE THEY'RE PROPOSING THAT ANYONE WHO TURNS UP ON GREECE'S SHORES WILL BE RETURNED TO TURKEY AND IN RETURN FOR EVERY SYRIAN REFUGEE SENT BACK ANOTHER SYRIAN WILL BE RESETTLED IN THE E.U. DIRECTLY FROM REFUGEE CAMPS IN TURKEY
THEY TRIED TO ADDRESS THE CRITICISM THAT SUCH A PLAN WOULD BE ILLEGAL BY SAYING ANYONE CLAIMING ASYLUM WILL BE GIVEN A FULL HEARING IN GREECE
AND THEY'RE GIVING A FOURTH THERE GIVING FEWER CONCESSIONS TO TURKEY IT WILL NEED TO SATISFY SEVENTY TWO PRECONDITIONS BEFORE TURKISH PEOPLE WILL BE GRANTED VISA FREE TRAVEL IN THE E.U. AND IT'S A LONG WAY FROM DOING THAT WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE TURKISH M. P. CAN CHEER JACK CAN WHO'S FROM THE A.K. PARTY GOOD MORNING TO YOU

BUT THEN AND I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WAS HANDLING
SITUATION OBVIOUS PROBLEMS WITH DUE RESPECT FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND WITH FULL RESPECT FOR THE LAW WELL IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT WHEN SHE HAS THAT SORT OF CONVERSATION WITH HER PREDECESSOR DOES IT
THE PRESENT DUMA HAS DISPUTED THE ARGUMENTS ARE SHOWN BY THE MEDIA SAYS IT'S A BIT WEIRD TRYING TO TO TO TO BREACH
VISUAL SYSTEM BUSINESS THAT'S NOT TRUE
PRESIDENT DE L'AMOUR GAVE HER AN EXPLANATION FOR THAT ON TWO OF THE GUESTS VIEW YESTERDAY BUT THE QUEST PROBLEM IS THAT SHE IS NOT BEING BELIEVED BY A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THE QUESTION NOW OBVIOUSLY IS WHERE WHAT HAPPENS AT THIS STAGE TO WHAT YOU YOU CAN'T CARRY ON WITH THESE SORTS OF DEMONSTRATIONS AND YOU'RE VERY SYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY BEING CALLED INTO ACCOUNT
I'VE GOT HERE WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEIR NEXT DEVELOPMENT THE FIGHT REPORT SHOWED
PRESIDENT DE LA WERE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED TO RUN THE COUNTRY UNTIL THE TEAM AND I BELIEVE THIS IS THIS IS RIGHT SHE HAS TO SHIN IS STILL FULL OF TO END HER
IN IN OFFICES AND I'M FULLY CONFIDENT THAT PRESIDENT DUMA HAS ALL THE CONDITIONS AND ABILITIES TO OVERCOME THIS CURRENT CRISIS THIS DIFFICULT TIMES WE ARE LIVING IN NOW

TELEGRAPH GUARDIAN A MIRROR HIGHLIGHT UNREST WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY EVER PROPOSED CUTS TO DISABILITY WELFARE PAYMENTS APPALLED EM PEAS THE MIRROR SAYS HAVE WRITTEN TO THE CHANCELLOR BEGGING HIM TO DROP THE PLANS OF THE MALE DAVID CAMERON WAS BEGGING USE THAT WORD AGAIN
THE E.U. TREATY JEAN CLAUDE YONKERS YESTERDAY AS HE SAW PERMISSION TO REDUCE THE V.A.T. ON TAMPONS IN A HUMILIATING ENCOUNTER THE PRIME MINISTER WAS FORCED TO USE A BRUSSELS SUMMIT ON THE MIGRANT CRISIS TO PLEAD FOR HELP ON REDUCING BRITISH TAX RATES ON FEMALE CEMETERY PRODUCTS THE MAIL SAYS THAT TAMPON TAX AGA ENCAPSULATES EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG WITH BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U.
AND THAT'S HIGHLIGHTED ON THE FRONT OF THE NEW DAY WHICH TELLS READERS THAT WOMEN IN THE U.K. HAD PAID OUT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION POUNDS IN V.A.T. ON TAMPONS IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS SCRAPPING IT WOULD BE A VICTORY FOR COMMON SENSE AND QUOTES A LABOUR SPOKESWOMAN SAYING PERIODS ARE NOT A LUXURY COUPLE OF PAPERS HIGHLIGHT WHERE THE TELEGRAPH CALLS A SCATHING AUDITORS REPORT WHICH IS APPARENTLY FOUND THAT JEAN CLAUDE YONKERS OFFICIALS DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE E.U. IS SPENT ON AID TO DETER AND DEPORT MIGRANTS
PROJECT'S WORTH A BILLION POUNDS IN THE BALKANS OR NORTH AFRICA SAID TO HAVE ACHIEVED NEXT NEXT TO NOTHING BECAUSE OF WHAT'S DESCRIBED AS CHAOTIC MISMANAGEMENT BY EUROCRATS WHO HAVE NO CLEAR STRATEGY AND RARELY MONITOR RESULTS MIXED VIEWS ON PLANS TO EXTEND COMPULSORY TEACHING OF MATHS TO THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN TOM IN THE MAIL SAYS MERCY YOU CAN BET BETTERS HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE BECAUSE LIKE HIM SHE WAS PATHOLOGICALLY USELESS AT MATHS IT'S QUARTER TO EIGHT
BRITAIN'S HIGHEST MOUNTAIN HAS GROWN BY A METRE ORDNANCE SURVEY NOW CALCULATES THAT BEN NEVIS STANDS AT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE METRES TALL THIS WAS THE VIEW FROM THE TOP BACK IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN WHEN IT WAS JUST ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR METRES
THAT'S LOVELY WINDING LAZILY THROUGH THE GLEN AND FROM HERE IS VISIBLE EVERY
POINT IS ABOUT FIVE MILES AWAY AT THE MINUTE IS COMING VERY CLOSE AT THIS HEIGHT WE HAVE JUST ABOUT THE MEDIA'S TEMPERATURE IN SCOTLAND A GRADIENT OF ABOUT ONE IN FIVE AND RATHER UP GOING BUT THE EFFORT IS THAT NEW EPIC THE GLAND OF THE THUMB IT TAKES BETWEEN TWO AND THREE OUT AND FROM THE TOP YOU CAN LOOK DOWN UPON A VIEWER'S GLORIOUSLY WILD AS YOU CAN
THE WONDERFUL SOUNDS LITTLE ORDEAL AND THERE WE GO WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DO EVERYBODY I DON'T WONDER WITH THE BRITISH PAT PAT THEY WERE MARK GREEN'S IS GEODETIC ANALYST AT ORDNANCE SURVEY WHICH MEANS THAT HE'S A MOUNTAIN MEASURER
MARK GREAVES GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND IT WAS YOU WHO ESTABLISHED THAT ACTUALLY WE'VE BEEN GETTING IT WRONG AS FAR AS BEN NEVIS IT'S GOING TO YEAH I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THE CALCULATIONS AND MY COLLEAGUES TO THE SERVER BUT I CRUNCHED ALL THE NUMBERS AND THEN REALISE THAT WITH WITH SLIGHTLY BRISBANE THERE IS A LITTLE BIT AND I'M WRONG IT HASN'T GROWN HAS JUST NATURE'S LITTLE WE'VE BEEN WRONG ALL ALONG I'M NOT WRONG JUST DIFFERENT BABY ORIGINAL SURVEY FROM NINETEEN FORTY NINE WAS WAS VERY CLASS THAT WAS REMARKABLY ACCURATE CONSIDERING THE METHODS THAT WAS
IT WAS USED IN THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY WORKED ON THERE SO WE WE'VE JUST HAD THE BETTER IMPROVED ANSWER THANK YOU WILL TELL US WHAT THE METHODS WERE BACK IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE THERE WAS A TEAM OF SIX OR SEVEN PEOPLE
TWO HUNDRED POUNDS WORTH OF EQUIPMENT AND I THINK THEY CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN EVERY EVENING THEY'D THE OBSERVATIONS TO PLACE AT NIGHT EVERY EVENING FOR I THINK HE'S TWENTY CONSECUTIVE EVENINGS IN AUDITED TO TAKE THE NECESSARY ANGLES AND MEASUREMENTS JUST JUST TO GET THAT ONE ANSWER SO IT WAS A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING QUITE LITERALLY A MILITARY OPERATION NOT NOT JUST ON BEN NEVIS BUT ON THE SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS AS WELL THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO MEASURE TILL I'M GAY AND SO WHAT DO YOU DO
IT'S A LITTLE EASIER NOW YOU STILL HAVE TO CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN I'M AFRAID BUT SURVEYORS TOOK UP A G.P.S. RECEIVER SATELLITE POSITIONING RECEIVER AND RECORDED ABOUT TWO HOURS OF DATA AT THE TOP AND THEN WE COME TO DO SOME FANCY COMPUTATIONS ON IT A BIT LATER ONCE IT'S COME BACK DOWN O.K. SO YOU'D BASICALLY LOOK AT A SCREEN AND RIGHT ENOUGH
NOT QUITE SO ROMANTIC IT'S NOT QUITE AS ROMANTIC BUT IT'S ALL THEY TALK ELLO COMPUTERISED REGISTERS WRONGLY THROUGH SOME VERY CLEVER SOFTWARE TO PRODUCE THE ANSWER I MEAN IT IS IT IS A SORT OF SLIGHTLY MAD AND WITH AMAZING JOB YOU HAVE IN A WAY MEASURING MOUNTAIN IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU DO EVERY DAY I MEAN I'VE GONE AND SERVE HIS MEN FOXES OBVIOUSLY CAPTURING MAPPING EVERYTHING URBAN AREAS WE HAVE TUNED IN FIFTY SURVEYORS CAPTURING TEN THOUSAND CHANGES A DAY AND THIS IS THE OTHER NEW HEIGHT FOR BEN NEVIS IS JUST ONE OF THEM
BUT IT IS A LITTLE BIT INTERESTED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TO MEASURE MOUNDS NOW AND AGAIN AND IS THAT IT DO WE KNOW THAT BEN NEVIS IS THIS HIGH OR COULD WE BE AT A POINT REVISING THAT FIGURE AND NO I WOULD SAY THAT SAY THAT THE NEW HIGH IS ACCURATE TO JUST A FEW CENTIMETRES SO UNLESS WE HAVE ANY KIND OF GEOLOGICAL CHANGES ARE SERIOUS UPLIFT US SOMETHING BEN NEVIS IS IS NOW
FIXED A IF SOMEBODY GOES AND PUTS A PILE OF BOULDERS UP THE TIE I THINK MY DIBBER WE WE WOULDN'T MEASURE THAT WE'D WE ALWAYS TRY AND MEASURE THE THE NATURAL HEIGHT OF THE MOUNTAIN RATHER THAN ANY KIND OF MAN MADE THINGS ARE PLONKED ON TOP OF IT MARK GREAVES THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GOING TO USE THAT NOT WRONG BUT DIFFERENT LINE IN FUTURE COULD COME IN VERY HANDY COULDN'T IT ELEVEN ADMINISTRATE THEY'LL HIT STUCK TO THE FLOOR FOR THE DAY AND WITH US THIS MORNING IS BISHOP RICHARD HARRIS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
THE LATEST FIGURES SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SLEEPING ON OUR STREETS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AT THE LAST COUNT THERE WERE SOME THREE AND A HALF THOUSAND ROUGH SLEEPERS AND THAT'S PROBABLY AN UNDERESTIMATE
GEORGE OSBORNE RESPONDED TO THIS IN THE BUDGET WITH A PACKAGE WHICH INCLUDING ACCOMMODATION PLACES FOR ROUGH SLEEPERS AMOUNTS TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION POUNDS THIS HAS BEEN WELCOMED BY THE CHARITIES BUT THEY SAY THE EMPHASIS NEEDS TO BE ON THE CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM AS WELL AS RESPONDING TO IT
I ALWAYS FEEL EXTREMELY UNEASY WHEN I PASSED SOMEONE HUDDLED UP ON THE PAVEMENT A GOOD NUMBER OF WHOM ARE LIKELY TO BE BEGGING APART FROM THE MISERY OF THEIR CONDITION THE WORDS OF JESUS ALWAYS HAUNT ME GIVE TO ANYONE WHO ASKS THAT'S CLEAR ENOUGH AND I KNOW SOMEONE WHO DOES JUST THAT GOES OUT OF THE HOUSE OF THE NUMBER ONE POUND COINS IN HIS POCKET READY TO GIVE AWAY
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PASSED SCORES OF SUCH PEOPLE AND ANYWAY IS THIS REALLY THE BEST WAY OF RESPONDING TO THOSE WORDS OF JESUS ISN'T IT FAR BETTER TO SUPPORT THOSE CHARITIES WORKING WITH THE HOMELESS TO GET THEM OFF THE STREETS ALTOGETHER
WHAT I AM QUITE CLEAR ABOUT IS THAT WE SHOULD OPEN OUR EYES TO THAT HUDDLE ON THE PAVEMENT RICHARD GERE WHO PRETENDED TO BE A HOMELESS PERSON FOR A FILM HE MADE SAID SIMPLY NO ONE NOTICED ME
THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS NOTICE SEE THAT PERSON AS A PERSON SOMEONE LIKE ME MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD THEN PERHAPS A SMILE WHAT WORD OR EVEN A SILENT SILENT PRAYER MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE
IN MY DEALINGS WITH THOSE WHO WORK WITH THE HOMELESS WHAT'S REALLY IMPRESSED ME IS THE WAY THEY DO OR SEE THEM AS PERSONS WITH A HUMAN DIGNITY TO BE RESPECTED THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT WHEN SOMEONE DOWN AND APPARENTLY OUT SHOWS REAL INDEPENDENCE OF SPIRIT
I REMEMBER WALKING ALONG THE STRAND EARLY ONE BITTERLY COLD MORNING AND BUYING A CUP OF TEA FOR ONE WOMAN SHELTERING IN A DOORWAY TAKE IT AWAY SHE SAID I ONLY DRINK COFFEE WHICH I DULY BOUGHT HER I LOVE THAT CHANCE BUT SHE WASN'T GOING TO BE SEEN ONLY AS SOMEONE TO WHOM GOOD WAS DONE
AND IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH THE POOR WEREN'T JUST LOOKED UPON AS PEOPLE WE HAD AN OBLIGATION TO HELP THEM COURSE WE DO THEY WERE REGARDED AS IN SOME WAY THE TREASURE OF THE CHURCH THERE'S A PRAYER FOR A NEWLY MARRIED COUPLE I LIKE WHICH GOES MAY YOU RECEIVE THE POUR INTO YOUR HOME THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE YOU INTO THE HABITATION OF ETERNITY
IT'S A SPIRIT STILL ALIVE IN SOME FORMS OF CHRISTIAN FAITH WHEN THE FOLK WORLD FAMOUS IS STONY AND COMPOSER A PAIR IT WAS IN OXFORD IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF A NEW PIECE OF HIS MUSIC HE WAS APPROACHED BY A BIGGER IN THE STREET
GIVE HIM SOME MONEY THEN WENT ROUND THE CORNER BENT HIS HEAD AND ASK FOR THE MAN'S BLESSING AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BISHOP RICHARD HARRIES THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT
IF YOUR TRAIN IS HALF AN HOUR LATE MOST RAIL COMPANIES WILL GIVE YOU HALF THE PRICE OF YOUR TICKET BACK IF IT'S AN ALLEY YOU SHOULD GET A COMPLETE REFUND BUT THAT ONLY HAPPENS IF YOU MAKE THE EFFORT TO CLAIM AN EIGHTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE DON'T THAT'S WHY THE RAIL REGULATOR IS NOW TELLING TRAIN COMPANIES TO PROVIDE BETTER INFORMATION AND MAKE IT EASIER TO CLAIM COMPENSATION WE SPOKE TO SOME REAL PASSENGERS ARE BIRMINGHAM NEW STREET STATION I'VE TRIED TO GET MONEY BACK
ONE IN THE PAST QUITE
EVASIVE IT'S JUST BEST IF THEY'RE FROM THE BUTTER YOU KNOW WE KNOW THEY'RE LIES
THERE'S A PLACE THAT WAS IT JUST NEEDS TO BE AN EASIER PROCESS BUT WHEN I WHEN I HAVE A PLANE DO YOU LAY FOR FIVE HOURS I GET THE MONEY BACK
TRIANG SUIT SEEM TO KIND OF JUST LIKE ITS DELAYS IN UNLESS IT IT'S A LOT EASIER WITH BIG COMPANIES LIKE VIRGIN DO AUTOMATIC REFUNDS
WE'D LIKE A SMALLER COMPANIES LIKE SOUTH EAST QUITE A LOT THIS IS THAT'S THE PAIN LIKE HAVING TO GET THE FORMS AND SENT THEM OFF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE OFFICE OF RAIL REGULATORS IS JOANNA WHITTINGTON
REALLY WANT TRAIN OPERATING COMPANIES TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER AWARENESS OF THE COMPENSATION THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO WE THINK THEY SHOULD DO THIS IN A COUPLE OF WAYS FIRST OF ALL BY HOLDING A NATIONAL PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN AND ALSO BY STAFF TRAINING
THE SECOND THING THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING AND SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS AND THEN FINALLY WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE A REALLY STUFFED SET OF ARRANGEMENTS FOR MONITORING TRAIN OPERATING COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE PERFORMANCE IN THIS AREA IMPROVES WHILE THE RAIL REGULATOR ONLY INVESTIGATED AFTER A COMPLAINT BY THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH ALEX NEIL IS ITS DIRECTOR OF CAMPAIGNS AND COMMUNICATIONS AND HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING ARE YOU SATISFIED THAT
THE REGULATOR HAS ANSWERED YOUR COMPLAINT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THINGS WILL CHANGE I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM WE'RE HAPPY WITH WHAT THEY PROPOSED THE REGULATOR HAS CONFIRMED WHAT WHICH HAS BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING THE COMPENSATION THAT THOUGH THEY'RE OWED SO IN THAT WAY THE PACKAGE OF MEASURES THAT THEY'VE PROPOSED A FAIRLY PEDESTRIAN BUT YOU CAN'T DISAGREE WITH BETTER INFORMATION CLEARLY IS REQUIRED TRAIN COMPANIES
ACTUALLY NOW NEED TO DELIVER ON THE OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD AND THE REGULATOR SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR THIS AND TAKING ACTION I THINK A BIG QUESTION IS WILL ANY ACTION GET TAKEN SO THE REGULATOR HAS QUITE CLEARLY SET OUT THE NEXT STEP AND PUT TIMEFRAMES AROUND IT SO THAT'S GOOD WE'LL BE WATCHING NOW TO SEE WHETHER ANYTHING REALLY DOES HAPPEN OFF THE BACK OF IT AND WHAT WE'D BE LOOKING FOR IS TO SEE THE REGULATOR
TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION WHERE IT'S FOUND THAT COMPANIES ARE BREAKING THE LAW OR THE LICENCE TERMS THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT RULES AND DIFFERENT COMPANIES HAVING TO FIND A FORM AND MAYBE YOU CAN'T GET IT THERE WAS A POINT MADE BY ONE OF THE PASSENGERS THEY'RE THE VIRGIN DO AUTOMATIC REFUND COULD NOT COULD THAT NOT BE SORT OF SOMETHING THAT IS AN OBLIGATION OF ALL COMPANIES AUTOMATICALLY REFUNDS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ALL BOUND UP WITH SMART TICKETING PROCESS WHICH IS ALL IN THE FRANCHISES SAID THE PROBLEM YOU ACTUALLY HIT UPON THERE IS THAT THE REGULATOR
CAN'T ACTUALLY REALLY DO THE JOB IT SHOULD DO BECAUSE THE FRANCHISES ARE CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT SO THERE IS A PROBLEM FOR THE REGULATOR OVERALL AND THE THING THAT WE'RE DISAPPOINTED WITH VISIT DIDN'T GIVE ITSELF THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY BE A CONSUMER CHAMPION OR MAKE SURE THAT IT CAN TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANIES ON THINGS LIKE THIS AND FORCE THEM TO DO IT
THAT STILL SITS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S QUITE A MODELLED RELATIONSHIP WHERE REALLY THE INDEPENDENT REGULATOR SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE'RE LEFT IN A SITUATION WHERE THE PUBLIC NEED TO BE TOLD AND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND COMPANIES NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND THE ROOT YEAH THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN I THINK THE BASIC THING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE SHORT TERM IS THAT THE COMPANY SHED
OVERHAUL THEIR PROCESSORS FOR CLAIMING MAKE IT MUCH EASIER THEY SHOULD BE TELLING YOU BASIC INFORMATION AND GET THAT RIGHT AND AGAIN THE REGULATOR FOUND EXACTLY WHAT WHICH DID IN FACT WORSE THAT MANY COMPANIES WHEN YOU DO ASK YOURSELF GIVE YOU THE WRONG INFORMATION SO THAT'S JUST BASIC AND REALLY PORN HAS TO STOP BUT THEN THE FUTURE HERE IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE COMPANIES DON'T IMPROVE BECAUSE THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO IF EIGHTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE AREN'T CLAIMING AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE OF ALL THE BARRIERS IN THEIR WAY
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE REGULATOR HASN'T SAID SAID WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES WILL BE IT HASN'T SAID I THINK THE THING THAT THE GAP HERE IS THAT IT SAID IT WILL MONITOR WHAT IT SILENT ON IS O.K. IF YOU MONITOR AND THE SITUATION HASN'T IMPROVED WHAT DOES IMPROVEMENT LOOK LIKE AND IF IT HASN'T IMPROVED WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT IT
WHY NOT DO YOU THINK I MEAN WHY ARE WE IN THIS SITUATION WHERE EFFECTIVELY COMPANIES CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED THEM TO DO WAS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO FOUR FOR ENFORCEMENT AND BUY THAT WHAT WE HAVE HAD TO DO WAS CREATE LICENCE TERMS AROUND THESE ISSUES WITH THE COMPANY'S BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE MOMENT IT SITS IN THE FRANCHISES WHICH ARE CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ONLY REVIEWED EVERY FOUR YEARS
SO THE REGULATOR REASON ACTUALLY TECHNICALLY IN THE BACKGROUND RESPONSIBLE SO IT'S MADE SOME REFERENCE THAT THE D. F. T. SHOULD MAKE FRANCHISES CLEARER BUT IT HASN'T GIVEN HER STRONG DIRECTION SO THEY D. F. T. TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE IT HASN'T GIVEN ITSELF THE POWERS TO DO THAT SO THAT'S QUITE WEAK AND WE WANT THAT CHANGING THE GOVERNMENT IS THAT KNOWLEDGE TO ACTUALLY THAT THE REGULATOR NEEDS BEEFING UP AND ITS POWERS AND DUTIES AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH SO WILL BE PURSUING THAT WITH THE F.T. AS WELL ALEX NEIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE EIGHTEENTH OF MARCH THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS HAVE AGREED NEW SAFEGUARDS WHICH IT'S HOPED WILL ENSURE THE LEGALITY OF A PLANNED TO EASE THE MIGRANT CRISIS ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD WITHIN THE POLICE FEDERATION OF ENGLAND AND WALES ARE BEING INVESTIGATED BY DETECTIVES A CHARITY IS CALLING FOR MORE RESEARCH AFTER STUDY SUGGESTED THAT PEOPLE WITH AUTISM HAVE MUCH SHORTER LIVES THAN THE REST OF THE POPULATION
AND WHY THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST MOUNTAIN ISN'T JUST A LITTLE BIGGER TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS CHRIS ALDRIDGE
EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS MEETING IN BRUSSELS HAVE AGREED TO SUPPORT THE CONTROVERSIAL PLAN TO TACKLE THE REFUGEE CRISIS BY SENDING MIGRANTS WHO REACH GREECE BACK TO TURKEY BUT THERE WILL BE FEWER CONCESSIONS THAN THE TURKS WANTED AND MORE LEGAL SAFEGUARDS FOR THE MIGRANTS THE DRAFT WILL BE PUT TO THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER IN BRUSSELS THIS MORNING
THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL INSISTED THAT NEGOTIATIONS WOULD NOT BE EASY FRANCE'S PRESIDENT ALONE SAID SUCCESS COULD NOT BE GUARANTEED FROM THE SUMMIT A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORT
LATE LAST NIGHT E.U. LEADERS AGREED UPON A COMMON POSITION THAT WILL NOW BE PUT TO THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER SOME OF THE INCENTIVES TO BE OFFERED TO TURKEY HAVE BEEN WATERED DOWN THERE WOULD BE NO SPECIAL TREATMENT AND ALL PRECONDITIONS FOR SPEEDING UP ITS E.U. MEMBERSHIP IT OR FORGIVING TURKISH CITIZENS VISA FREE TRAVEL TO THE SHANNON AREA WOULD HAVE TO BE MET IN FULL
LEGAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED DEAL TO RETURN ALL IRREGULAR MIGRANTS FROM THE GREEK ISLANDS TO TURKEY HAVE ALSO BEEN DISCUSSED IN DETAIL
SEVERAL E.U. COUNTRIES ARE WORRIED ABOUT HER LACK OF CLARITY IN THE WAY TURKEY SAYS IT WOULD MEET ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS TO LOOK AFTER ALL REFUGEES SO THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT A WORKABLE DEAL CAN BE DONE LATER TODAY THERE'S ALSO THE PROSPECT OF HUGE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES AHEAD GREECE IS ALREADY STRUGGLING TO COPE AND IT SAYS IT WOULD NEED THE HELP OF SEVERAL THOUSAND OFFICIALS FROM ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE TO SET UP A FUNCTIONING ASYLUM SYSTEM ON THE GREEK ISLANDS IN A MATTER OF DAYS
DETECTIVES ARE INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD INVOLVING THE POLICE FEDERATION OF ENGLAND AND WALES THE BODY WHICH REPRESENTS CONSTABLES SERGEANTS AND INSPECTORS HAS THE NEWS EMERGED THE FEDERATION SEPARATELY CONFIRMED THAT ITS VICE CHAIRMAN WILL RICHES HAD RESIGNED HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
OFFICIALS FROM THE POLICE FEDERATION SAID THEY ASKED DETECTIVES TO INVESTIGATE AFTER IDENTIFYING WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS POTENTIAL FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY THEY SAID IT RELATES TO BANK ACCOUNTS HELD BY THE FEDERATION'S CONSTABLE'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE SURREY POLICE SAID IT WAS INVESTIGATING WHETHER ANY OFFENCES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED DURING THE DAY DETECTIVES FROM THE FORCE CARRIED OUT ENQUIRIES AT THE FEDERATION'S HEADQUARTERS IN LEATHERHEAD NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED
THE FEDERATION ALSO CONFIRMED THAT WILL RICHES HE'S BEEN VICE CHAIRMAN FOR TWO YEARS HAS RESIGNED NO OFFICIAL REASON HAS BEEN GIVEN MY RICH IS A METROPOLITAN POLICE CONSTABLE HAS NOT RESPONDED TO REQUEST TO COMMENT
THE CHARITY HAS WARNED THAT PEOPLE WITH AUTISM OR DYING ON AVERAGE SIXTEEN YEARS EARLIER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION SIGHTING A LARGE STUDY CARRIED OUT IN SWEDEN AUTISTIC SAYS PEOPLE WITH AUTISM ARE DYING AT THE AGE OF FIFTY FOUR RATHER THAN SEVENTY THAT EPILEPTIC SEIZURES HEART DISEASE AND SUICIDE OF THE LEADING CAUSES IT WANTS MORE RESEARCH CARRIED OUT AUTISTIC AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE JOHN SPIERS TOLD US VERY LITTLE WAS KNOWN ABOUT WHY PEOPLE WITH THE CONDITION AT A MUCH LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCY
ONE OF THE HUGE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IS THERE IS BARELY ANY RESEARCH DONE INTO OLDER PEOPLE WITH AUTISM SO THE BULK OF RESEARCH IS DONE IN CHILDREN AND THAT MEANS WE UNDERSTAND REALLY VERY LITTLE ABOUT HOW AND WHY AND WHEN AUTISTIC PEOPLE ARE DYING SO THERE IS THERE IS AN ENORMOUS NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH
THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY BE RE THINKING PROPOSALS TO RESTRICT SOME BENEFIT PAYMENTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES MINISTERS ARGUED THAT TIGHTENING THE CRITERIA FOR THE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THE CASH IS BETTER TARGETED BUT ONE CONSERVATIVE M.P. HAS SAID THAT SCORES OF HIS COLLEAGUES WERE OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE SPEAKING ON B.B.C. ONE'S QUESTION TIME LAST NIGHT THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN APPEAR TO SUGGEST THAT THE PLANS COULD BE REVISED
FIRST OF ALL WE'VE GOT TO FINISH THE CONVERSATION AND THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE ARE HAVING WITH EM PEAS BUT ALSO WITH DISABILITY GROUPS AND OTHERS BEFORE WE EVEN BRING ANY LEGISLATION FORWARD THERE'S BEEN INDEPENDENT REVIEW THAT HAS THAT HAPPENED PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD AND WE ARE CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS
DAVID BURROWS HE'S ONE OF THE CONSERVATIVE BACKBENCHERS PRESSING FOR A RE THINK THIS ARE SOME OF THE MOST WONDERFUL PEOPLE AND WE WANT TO THE SIDE OR TRYING TO GET THEM TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WORK OR GET IT TO WORK AND THAT'S THE BUILT THE HOLDER THE GUMS AGENDA TO IMPROVE THEIR LIFE
CHANCES
I THINK HE'S TAKES A BACKWARD STEP FOR THE WAY WE'RE LOOKING AT FROM NOW AND SO I WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES BE URGING THE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT
FIGURES ARE SEEN BY THE B.B.C. SHOW THAT SPENDING ON HEALTH AND EDUCATION WILL BE SQUEEZED BY MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS BECAUSE OF CHANGES TO PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS EMPLOYERS SUCH AS N.H.S. TRUSTS AND SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE MORE TO STAFF PENSIONS IN THREE YEARS' TIME THE TREASURY SAYS EMPLOYERS ARE WELL PLACED TO ABSORB THE EXTRA COSTS AS INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED BUT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER TIM FARRON TOLD THIS PROGRAMME HE FEARED SERVICES WOULD BE AFFECTED
MIGHT WELL BE TRUE THAT FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST THAT THOSE PEOPLE WORKING IN THE N.H.S. WILL NOT HAVE THEIR PERSONAL PENSIONS AFFECTED WHAT WILL BE AFFECTED IS WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN AFFORD TO GIVE THAT WILL HAVE THOSE JOBS IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE OF THIS CAN BE FEWER DOCTORS FEWER NURSES A WORSE DEAL FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS FOR EXAMPLE FEWER TEACHERS LESS MONEY FOR SCHOOLS FEWER POLICE AND PEOPLE WHO SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN THE ARMED FORCES BEING GIVEN THEIR P. FORTY FIVE AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE OF THAT INTERVIEW AFTER EIGHT THIRTY
BRITISH OFFICIALS SAY DAVID CAMERON HAS SECURED THE SUPPORT OF OTHER E.U. LEADERS TO ALLOW THE U.K. TO SCRAP V.A.T. ON YON SANITARY PRODUCTS THE SO CALLED TAMPON TAX THE GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN FACING A COMMONS REVOLT BY A NUMBER OF EURO SCEPTIC CONSERVATIVES WHO THREATENED TO JOIN LABOUR IN VOTING TO REMOVE THE FIVE PER CENT CHARGE THE LOWEST RATE ALLOWABLE UNDER E.U. LAW THE COMMISSION IS TO PUBLISH PROPOSALS NEXT WEEK ALLOWING MEMBER STATES MORE FREEDOM TO ABOLISH V.A.T. ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS
A SENIOR U.K. OFFICIAL WORKING IN BRUSSELS HAS SAID THE GOVERNMENT WOULD SPEND UP TO TEN YEARS REWRITING ITS LAWS IF IT VOTES TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE OFFICIAL ALSO SAID THAT A WITHDRAWAL TREATY WOULD NEED TO BE RATIFIED BY EVERY MEMBER OF THE UNION FROM BRUSSELS HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT BEN RIGHT
A BIG QUESTION IN THE COMING REFERENDUM IS EXACTLY HOW THE U.K.'S DEPARTURE FROM THE E.U. WOULD HAPPEN IF VOTERS CHOOSE TO LEAVE
UNDER ARTICLE FIFTY OF THE E.U. RULE BOOK EXIT NEGOTIATION SHOULD LAST TWO YEARS BUT BEYOND THAT THERE'S A SENIOR U.K. OFFICIAL HAS SAID WE WOULD BE SLIGHTLY MAKING IT UP AS WE GO ALONG
THE OFFICIAL SAID BRICKS IT WOULD MEAN EIGHT D. ACCESSION PROCESS AND IN THE U.K. THERE WOULD BE A TRADE OFF BETWEEN NEW SOVEREIGNTY AND ACCESS TO E.U. MARKETS THE WHOLE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA FOR UP TO TEN YEARS WOULD BE DOMINATED BY RE REGULATING AND READ LEGISLATING EVERYTHING IN A SOVEREIGN BRITISH WAY THE OFFICIALS SAID
SPEAKING IN BRUSSELS LAST NIGHT THE JUSTICE SECRETARY CHRIS GRAYLING A CAMPAIGNER FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE SAID DIVORCE FROM THE E.U. DID NOT NEED TO BE ACRIMONIOUS
THE UNITED STATES IT'S NORTH KOREA HAS FIRED TO BALLISTIC MISSILES IN DEFIANCE OF INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS IT'S THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF WEAPONS TEST CARRIED OUT BY NORTH KOREA
TWO PEOPLE HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR EBOLA IN GUINEA ALMOST THREE MONTHS AFTER THE OUTBREAK WAS DECLARED OVER IN THE WEST AFRICAN COUNTRY IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT THREE MEMBERS OF THE PATIENT'S FAMILY RECENTLY DIED AFTER SHOWING SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE THEIR VILLAGE HAS BEEN SEALED OFF AND VACCINES ARE BEING TAKEN TO THE AREA
TRAIN COMPANIES ARE BEING TOLD TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO CLAIM COMPENSATION IF THEIR JOURNEYS ARE DELAYED THE RAIL REGULATOR SAYS EIGHTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE DON'T CLAIM AND OPERATORS MUST PROVIDE BETTER INFORMATION IS A PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT SIMON GUMPERT
WHEN DELAYS HAPPEN MOST RAIL COMPANIES WILL REFUND HALF THE TICKET PRICE FOR A THIRTY MINUTE HOLD UP THE FULL PRICE IF YOU'RE AN HOUR LATE BUT THAT'S IF YOU CLAIM OFTEN INFORMATION IS SCANTY THE FORMS HARD TO GET AND STAFF DON'T SEEM TO KNOW THE RULES THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH MADE A SUPER COMPLAINT FORCING THE OFFICE OF RAIL AND ROAD TO INVESTIGATE NOW THE REGULATORS CALLING ON TRAIN COMPANIES TO RUN A CAMPAIGN TO RAISE AWARENESS TO PROVIDE FORMS IN PLAIN ENGLISH AND WE IMPLEMENT TRAINING PROGRAMMES FOR STAFF
IT ALSO ONCE MORE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON BOARD AND ON THE PLATFORM EXPLAINING WHAT TO DO THE RAIL DELIVERY GROUP WHICH SPEAKS FOR THE OPERATOR SAYS THEY'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING THE PROCESS SIMPLER VIRGIN AND ANOTHER TRAIN COMPANY C. TWO C. HAVE STARTED COMPENSATING SOME CUSTOMERS AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT THE NEED TO CLAIM
BEN NEVIS BRITAIN'S TALLEST MOUNTAIN IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THIS MORNING THE COUNTRY'S OFFICIAL MAPPING AGENCY ORDNANCE SURVEY SAYS IT HAS RE MEASURED THE MOUNTAIN AND FOUND IT TO BE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE METRES HIGH A METRE TALLER THAN PREVIOUSLY STATED BUT AS OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN AMOS EXPLAINS THE CHANGES PURELY TECHNICAL
THE OFFICIAL MEASURING POINTER TOP BEN NEVIS SITS ON A CAIRN AND WHEN THIS PILE OF STONES WAS RESTORED RECENTLY ORDNANCE SURVEY EXPERTS TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHECK THE MOUNTAINS EXACT HEIGHT IT'S MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS SINCE THIS WAS LAST DONE AND BACK THEN IT TOOK A TEAM THREE WEEKS TO TRIANGULATE THE HEIGHT AFTER HAULING HEAVY GEAR UP BEN NEVIS AND NEARBY MOUNTAINS
TODAY SCIENTISTS HAVE THE BENEFIT OF G.P.S. WHICH IS ACCURATE TO THE NEAREST CENTIMETRE AND WHEN THE NEW DATA WAS GATHERED OVER A COUPLE OF HOURS ON BEN NEVIS AND ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST METRE IT MEANT THE REMNANT VOLCANO WAS OFFICIALLY HIGHER ORDNANCE SURVEY SAYS ALL ITS MAPS ONE NOW FEATURE THE NEW HEIGHT JONATHAN AMOS REPORTING THERE IT'S TEN PAST EIGHT
THERE IS A CRISIS IN OUR PRISONS ARE CRISIS CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT MANY PRISONERS SHOULDN'T BE THERE AT ALL THEY'RE MENTALLY ILL AND THEY SHOULD BE INSECURE OR MENTAL HOSPITALS ACCORDING TO FIGURES RELEASED LAST YEAR ONE PRISONER COMMITTED SUICIDE EVERY FOUR DAYS HAS BEEN A RISE IN SELF HARMING TOO AND ALTHOUGH PRISONERS ARE S'POSED TO BE MOVED TO HOSPITAL WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS IF THEY'RE SECTIONED UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT HUNDREDS ARE MISSING THAT DEADLINE EVERY YEAR
THERE ARE FIVE THOUSAND SECURE HOSPITAL BEDS IN ENGLAND WHERE PRISONERS AND PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED A CRIME WELL THEY'RE SUFFERING MENTAL ILLNESS CAN BE TREATED IT'S RARE FOR JOURNALISTS TO SEE HOW THEY WORK BUT A REPORTER SANCHA BIRD HAS BEEN ALLOWED IN TO THE BETHLEM ROYAL HOSPITAL NOW PART OF THE SOUTH LONDON AND MAUDSLEY N.H.S. TRUST
DOCTOR TIM MACHIN ERNIE CONSULTANT PSYCHIATRIST AT THE BETHLEM ROYAL HOSPITAL SHOWS ME ROUND HIS SECURE BOARD SO WE'RE JUST GOING DOWN THE MAIN CORRIDOR
THE WALLED HOUSES NINETEEN NINETEEN MEN THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL ROOM WITH SONGS
IT'S QUITE A SPACIOUS WARD IT'S BUILT AROUND A CENTRAL COURTYARD
COME HERE ARE PREPARING FOR A RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY
THEY HAVE GOT LOTS OF UNESCORTED LEAVE SO WE HAVE A SORT OF A LOW SECURE ENVIRONMENT WHICH PROMOTES RESPONSIBILITY ALMOST ALL OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE COMMITTED VERY SERIOUS OFFENCES MURDER RAPE VIOLENT ASSAULT WHILE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS MOST HAVE SPENT YEARS INSECURE HOSPITALS
THE QUESTION IS CAN THEY NOW BE RELEASED SAFELY I OFTEN FEEL THAT BEHAVIOUR IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF MONITORING WHAT'S
PERHAPS INSIDE THEIR MINDS IT'S THE BEHAVIOUR WHICH GOT THEM INTO FORENSIC CARE IT'S ALL SORT OF ALMOST TWENTY FOUR OUT MONITORING AN OBSERVATION OF THE BEHAVIOUR WHICH GIVES US THE BEST INDICATION AS TO WHETHER THEY'RE ACHIEVING MATURITY RESPONSIBILITY AND SAFETY
BUT CAN YOU TELL DO YOU WORRY WHEN YOU RELEASE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE I WOULD SAY THAT I DON'T WORRY I THINK IT'S VERY CAREFUL DECISION TAKING AND THE DECISIONS ARE TAKEN
PROBABLY CAUTIOUSLY BUT VERY CAREFULLY ONCE A WEEK DOCTORS NURSES THERAPISTS SOCIAL WORKERS ASSEMBLE IN A SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM WHERE THERE ARE SECURITY CAMERAS AND A LARGE RED PANIC BUTTON IN TURNED THE PATIENTS ARE ESCORTED IN THEIR PROGRESS REVIEWED ONE MAN IS CLEARLY UPSET
O.K. WHAT
HE WAS ABOUT TO BE DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL HE'S BEEN STAYING AT A HOSTEL OUTSIDE BUT STAFF FOUND HE'D TAKEN BANNED DRUGS HEROIN AND COCAINE
RIGHT AND THIS IS GROWING HAVE YOU SEEN HOW KIND AND HEROIN SO I'VE GOT I DON'T KNOW
DRAW IT AGAIN O.K. ALL RIGHT IT'S NOT SOMETHING I REALLY WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN ALL THIS ONE WILD WHEATLEY
BIT BITS I CAN'T AGAIN
THANK YOU ALL RIGHT YOU GO INTO FINANCIAL PROBLEMS YES CRY AS WELL AS YOU PRISON
THE PATIENT HAS TO GO BACK TO THE SECURE WARD FOR A WEEK IF HE STAYS CLEAR OF DRUGS HE'LL GET ANOTHER CHANCE IN THE HOSTEL DOCTOR MAC AND ANY SUSPECTS HE MAY NOT REALLY WANT TO GO AFTER SO MANY YEARS IN INSTITUTIONS SOME PATIENTS ARE NERVOUS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD
I SPOKE TO ANOTHER PATIENT WHO'S DUE TO BE RELEASED AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE AND ASKED HIM ABOUT THE TREATMENT THE THERAPY HE'S HAD HIS WORDS ARE SPOKEN BY AN ACTOR
PRIOR TO DOING THE COURSE I DIDN'T IDENTIFY WAS MANY OF MY EMOTIONS I USED TO LOCK THEM UP PUT THEM IN A BOX IN MY HEAD AND FORGET ABOUT THEM ALL RIGHT USE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL TO DISGUISE THEM
SINCE COMING HERE I FOUND MYSELF EXPERIENCING MORE EMOTIONS AND I EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE I CAN IDENTIFY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE SAD AND EMPATHISE WITH THEM WHICH I COULDN'T DO BEFORE WHICH IN SOME CASES CAN BE VERY HARD BUT I'M GETTING THERE SLOWLY
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE CRIMES YOU COMMITTED HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THEM NOW
WELL I'M SORRY THAT I DID DO THEM BUT IF I HADN'T DONE I WOULDN'T BE WHERE I AM TODAY I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE MYSELF AS I WAS THEN DEVELOP MYSELF INTO A BETTER CHARACTER DO YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU GO OUT YOU'LL NEVER BEHAVE LIKE THAT AGAIN THAT YOU ARE SAFE
I HOPE SO I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M GOING TO BE A COMPLETELY NORMAL PERSONALITY BECAUSE NOBODY IS NORMAL AND IF ANYONE DOES FIND A NORMAL PERSON AND
IN THE EIGHT YEARS IT'S BEEN OPEN THIS UNIT HAS HAD A GOOD TRACK RECORD ACCORDING TO DOCTOR MIKE AND ERNIE WE'VE JUST CHARGED OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS TO THE COMMUNITY WE'VE HAD ABOUT
TWENTY WERE READMITTED TO HOSPITAL NOT BECAUSE A WRIST BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE THEY'VE SADLY RELAPSE TO BECOME SICK
FOUR HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN AN OFFENCE
BUT NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN ASSAULT WHEN CONSIDERING THE BED'S COMING INTO THE SERVICE WERE INVOLVED IN SUCH SERIOUS CRIMES AND WITH SUCH COMPLEX VULNERABILITIES OR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS
WE SEE THIS AS A MARK OF SUCCESS THE PROBLEMS IN HIS VIEWER ELSEWHERE WHENEVER SOMEONE LEAVES THE UNIT THEIR BEDS FILLED VERY QUICKLY SOMETIMES THE SAME DAY DEMAND IS ACUTE ESPECIALLY FROM PRISONS WHERE MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED AND WHERE THE SUICIDE RATE IS RISING
SANCHA BIRD REPORTING THERE AND YOU CAN SEE INSIDE BETHLEM ROYAL HOSPITAL ON THE TODAY PROGRAMME WEBSITE AND ON A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT OF I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW ABOUT PROFESSOR TOM HE WAS THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR AT HE ALSO CHOSE THE FORENSIC FACULTY AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF CICADA IS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THAT
WHAT SHE WAS SAYING WHAT THE DOCTORS WERE HEARING FROM AS WELL MAKING VERY CLEAR IS THAT THE DIFFICULTY LIES ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES LIES IN HOW YOU DECIDE AND WHEN YOU DECIDE TO DISCHARGE SOMEBODY
WE HAVE A VERY CAREFUL PROCESS FROM FOR A DISCHARGE DECISION MAKING I MEAN WE WE START BY ENSURING THAT THE PATIENT HAS RECOVERED FROM THEIR ACUTE ILLNESS IF THAT'S PSYCHOSIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FREE OF PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS WE IDENTIFY RISK FACTORS THAT THEY MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO IN THE COMMUNITY LIKE RETURNED TO DRUG ABUSE
OR A STRESSFUL LIVING ENVIRONMENT AND THEN WE TAKE A GRADED APPROACH TOWARDS DISCHARGE TAKING PATIENTS OUT ON THE COMPANY LEAVE FROM THE UNITS INITIALLY THEN MOVING TOWARDS UNSUPERVISED LEAVE CONNECTING THEM WITH PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES IN THE COMMUNITY OCCUPATIONAL ACTIVITIES FAMILY CONTACT AND THEN MOST OF OUR PATIENTS WILL ACTUALLY MOVE INTO SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION SO THERE WILL BE TWENTY FOUR OR SEVEN HOUSING SUPPORT STAFF IN IN HOSTELS
AND THERE WAS A GREAT A GRADUAL PATHWAY WHICH IDEALLY WILL END UP WITH A PATIENT RETURNING TO INDEPENDENT LIVING BUT PRESUMABLY YOU HAVE TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION AND IT ISN'T ENTIRELY YOUR DECISION THE CLINICIANS DECISION IS IT YOU HAVE TO REFER DISCHARGES TWO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE YES MOST OF OUR PATIENTS ARE BUT CALL MANAGED WITH THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE THE MENTAL HEALTH UNIT
DISCHARGE DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE AND THE FINAL DECISION GOES TO A COURT OR MENTAL HEALTH REVIEW TRIBUNAL SO THAT IT'S A VERY CAUTIOUS BROOKE PROCESS IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ADVICE FROM THE CLINICIANS BUT ALL RIGHT
WELL IN THE OTHER THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE AND THE TRIBUNAL SOMETIMES DON'T AGREE WITH US IN THEM AT THE INN THE MAJORITY OF OCCASIONS THEY DO AND THE OUTCOME IS VERY SAFE BUT DID THE PROCESS DEFINITELY ERRORS ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION AS IT SHOULD
BECAUSE OUR ROLE IS NOT JUST TO GET THE PATIENT WELL BUT ALSO THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC BUT OF COURSE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THERE WILL BE PEOPLE IN THESE HUGELY EXPENSIVE BEDS WHO HORTON TO BE THERE BECAUSE AND OTHER PEOPLE NEED THE DEMAND OUTSTRIPS SUPPLY THAT'S FOR SURE AND ONE OF THE WAYS OF MEETING THE DEMAND WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT THAT WOULD BE WE WOULD WELCOME THAT BUT THAT'S A BIT THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE
THE OTHER APPROACH IS TO MANAGE THE COMMISSIONING OF SERVICES MORE INTELLIGENTLY AND ALSO TO LOOK AT THE DISCHARGE PROCESS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS EFFICIENT I THINK AT THE MOMENT THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE ARE HAMPERED BY RESOURCE PROBLEMS WE KNOW THAT LOT OF THE STUFF THEY HAVE LOST STAFF THEY HAVE THERE HAVE BEEN CUTBACKS WE KNOW THAT STAFF WHO MAKE THESE DECISIONS ARE MANAGING UP TO THREE HUNDRED CASES
VERY VERY HIGH CASELOAD ISN'T IT IT'S A HIGH CASELOAD AND IT DOES ACCOUNT FOR A DATE THEY SET TARGETS FOR DECISION MAKING AND CERTAINLY OUR EXPERIENCE IN FORENSIC SERVICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE'VE RECENTLY DONE A SURVEY OF THIS SHOW'S HAD MONEY IN MANY CASES WE ARE EXPERIENCING LONG DELAYS IN DECISION MAKING
IF THAT COULD BE MADE MORE EFFICIENT AND IF N.H.S. ENGLAND COMMISSIONED SERVICES ARE BEARING IN MIND GOOD OUTCOMES AND SAFE OUTCOMES I THINK WE WOULD HAVE A MORE EFFICIENT SERVICE WE HAD YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM IDEA SO CHARLIE ON THE PROGRAMME AN HOUR AGO SO THERE MUST BE MORE BEDS
WELL THAT IS A BIG ASK I MEAN AS I SAID WE WOULD WELCOME MORE BEDS BUT I THINK THE PLACE TO BEGIN IS TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES MORE EFFICIENTLY AND ALSO TO LOOK AT THE HEALTH CARE IN PRISONS AND MENTAL HEALTH OF STANDARDS AND PRISONS HAVE DETERIORATED SUICIDES ARE UP THERE'S A TERRIBLE PROBLEM WITH LEGAL HIDES FROM OUR PROSPECT THAT HE GOT TO BE BEFORE YOU MOVE ON FROM THE LEGAL HIGHS HOW DO THEY GET IN SORT OF QUITE EASY TO SEE IN A WAY HOW THEY GET INTO VAST PRISONS BUT IN THESE VERY SECURE
MENTAL HEALTH UNITS HOW DO THEY GET IN IT'S MUCH MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DETECT LEGAL HIGHS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE SYSTEMS FOR DETECTING THEM CHEMICALLY YOU CAN'T SMELL THEM THAT DOGS CAN'T SMELL THAN ON YOUR OWN DRUG SCREENING THEY DON'T SHOW UP SOMEWHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY INTRODUCING NEW METHODS OF TESTING BUT WE ARE USUALLY A FEW STEPS BEHIND WHEN HE COMES AND THEY ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS THEY DO CALLS
YES THEY'RE PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY DANGEROUS WE HAVE PATIENTS COLLAPSING AND BEEN TAKEN TO HOSPITAL AS EMERGENCY CASES AND WE SEE A LOT OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD EXTENSIVE WORK TO STABILISE THE MENTAL ILLNESS START TO USE LEGAL HIGHS AND ENCOUNTER MAJOR SETBACKS IT'S A REAL PROBLEM ACROSS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND HEALTH CARE AND US AS CURTIS DO YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING ENOUGH TO STOP THEM
YES I THINK WE'RE TRYING BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY'RE SO EASY TO TO BUY I DON'T THINK THE LAW HAS CAUGHT UP WITH MET MANAGING THAT PROBLEM YES AND IF YOU BAN ONE THEN ANOTHER ONE IS PRODUCE PRECISELY SO IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM WE CONCENTRATE ON THAT PROBLEM IN OUR SERVICE INCLUDING IN THE WORLD THAT THAT YOU BROKE REPORTED FROM
BY EDUCATING PATIENTS ABOUT THE RISKS JUST A FINAL QUICK SORT OF AT THE COST OF A BED IN ONE OF YOUR UNITS IN SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT ON AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND STAGGERING SUMS THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND WOULD BE PLACES LIKE BROUGHT MORE HIGH SECURE SERVICES WE OPERATE MEDIUM SECURE UNITS FOR WHERE IT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THEY'RE EXPENSIVE BUT THEY'RE VERY EFFECTIVE SERVICES THERE
THEY PRODUCE AMAZING RESULTS IF YOU LOOK AT REOFFENDING RATES AMONG OUR PATIENTS THEY'RE EXTREMELY LOW WHEN PATIENTS ARE EVENTUALLY DISCHARGED TO THE COMMUNITY WERE PUT THERE WHICH IS THE OUTCOME IN ALMOST ALL CASES PROFESSOR FUNNY THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED YOUR TIME IS NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT
WHEN HER TASHA POLLOCK WAS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT SHE STARTED BLEEDING HEAVILY SHE WAS RUSHED TO HOSPITAL AND IN THE SURGERY THAT FOLLOWED LOST FORTY FOUR PINTS OF BLOOD
A BODY ONLY HAS EIGHT PINTS OF BLOOD IN IT ONE DOCTOR TOLD HER THAT NO ONE HAD EVER SURVIVED LOSING SO MUCH BLOOD WILL SHE NOT ONLY SURVIVE BUT SO DID HER SON OLIVER WHO WAS BORN ON CHRISTMAS EVE SHE JOINS US NOW AS DOES DOCTOR EDWIN MASSIE WHO'S CONSULTANT HAEMATOLOGIST AT N.H.S. BLOOD AND TRANSPLANT GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING GOOD MORNING NATASHA POLLOCK HOW ARE YOU AND HOW'S OLIVER
I'M VERY WELL THANK YOU IT'S BEEN A LONG RECOVERY BUT ALL AS WELL OLIVER'S UPSTAIRS SNOOZY FROM WHAT I'VE READ OF THE CASE YOUR PARTICULAR PROBLEM WAS THAT YOUR PLACENTA WAS GROWING OUTSIDE THE USUAL
YES IT IS I HAVE TO STRESS IT'S AN INCREDIBLY RARE CONDITION AND IT WAS UNFORTUNATE IT WAS IT WASN'T DIAGNOSED BEFORE SURGERY SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE HAD I HAD A BIT AND LITTLE BLADE AT HOME WE WENT INTO HOSPITAL
JUST TO BE PRECAUTIONARY AT THIRTY TWO WEEKS I BLED A LOT MORE THE FOLLOWING NIGHT IT HAD STOPPED THERE ON CHRISTMAS EVE I'VE HAD A LOT MORE AND I WAS ALREADY IN THE HOSPITAL AND WENT IN STRAIGHT FOR AN EMERGENCY C. SECTION BECAUSE OF A PLACENTA PREVIOUS CONDITION WHICH WE WERE AWARE OF THAT WHEN THEY OPENED ME UP THAT'S WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE UTERUS HAD ACTUALLY GOT AT THAT PER CENTRE SORRY HAD GROWN THROUGH THE UTERINE WALL NOW PRESUMABLY YOU NICE YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING FROM THAT POINT
NO NO I WENT INTO THEATRE I PHONED MY HUSBAND BECAUSE IT WAS CHRISTMAS TIME SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR FATHER CHRISTMAS AND MY SURGEON BASED IT ON TO GET OFF THE PHONE I HAD TO I HAD TO PUT MY GENERAL AESTHETIC IN BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I'M HERE FOR CHILDREN THE SHOW MUST GO ON SO WE SEVERAL CHRISTMAS AND THEN I HAD A GENERAL ANAESTHETIC
O.K. AND THEN DOCTOR EDWIN MERCY FROM WHAT THEN HAPPENED I MEAN THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY CAN LIVE I THINK IT WAS THIRTY NINE POINTS JOIN THE SURGERY ITSELF I MEAN JUST THE PRACTICALITIES OF BEING IN AN OPERATING THEATRE WHEN YOU ARE PUMPING BLOOD IN AND AS FAST AS YOUR PUMPING IT IN IT'S COMING OUT
THANKFULLY HE SUCH ENORMOUS HAEMORRHAGES IS VERY RARE IT'S VERY DRAMATIC DESCRIBED BY YOURSELF AND NATASHA
DONOR BLOOD IS LIFE SAVING WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN THE CONTEXT INTERNATIONALLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS INSUFFICIENT SUPPLIES WERE SAFE BLOOD DEATH FROM BLEEDING IS THE COMMONEST CAUSE OF
MATERNAL DEATH INTERNATIONALLY BUT THANKFULLY IN THE U.K. AND IN OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ADVANCES IN SURGERY DRUGS AND OTHER FLUIDS HAVE ANNEXED FOR EXAMPLE WHICH WAS USED IN HER CASE AS WERE MANY OTHER INTERVENTIONS I'M SURE
AND THAT DOES REDUCE THE NEED FOR BLOOD BUT THAT'S VERY DRASTIC DRAMATICALLY DEMONSTRATED
IT WAS LIFE SAVING PARTICULARLY A D. NEGATIVE UNIVERSAL EMERGENCY BLOOD THAT BUT THAT'S REQUIRED
BECAUSE BECAUSE NATASHA YOU'RE EXHAUSTED THEIR HOSPITAL SUPPLIES AND THEY HAD TO PREPARE TO BE DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET SOME MORE AND THAT THAT I KNOW IS WHY YOU'RE BOTH DOING INTERVIEWS TO TRY TO HIGHLIGHT THE THE THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE DO NEED TO GIVE BLOOD
ABSOLUTELY I COULDN'T AGREE MORE YOU HAD AS A WHEN WHEN UTE TOLD US THAT WE WERE MAKING THESE PHONE CALLS YOU THEN WENT ON TO THE GENERAL SAID IT WHAT WHAT DO YOU THEN REMEMBER WHAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU CAME ROUND
I HAD THE MOST HORRIFYING LOOKING HUSBAND
AND UNFORTUNATELY IN JULY FOURTEEN WE'D LOST A BABY SO MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS OH MY GOSH PLEASE TELL ME WE HAVE NOT LOST ANOTHER BABY I DON'T I DON'T KNOW HOW WE COULD HAVE MANAGED IT
AND MY HUSBAND SAID NO NO THE BABY IS FINE THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW AFTER THAT I DON'T THINK I LISTENED VERY MUCH BUT AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT BABY IS FINE YOU SAID YOU YOU HOWEVER GAVE US A NIGHT TO REMEMBER BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN TOLD YOU WERE UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE
YEAH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I DEVELOPED D.I.C. WHICH I CAN'T PRONOUNCE BUT I'M SURE THE DOCTOR BUT MIGHT BE ABLE
YES THAT'S DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION WE NEED TO OUR NEEDS TO CLOT AT THE POINT WHERE IT'S BLEEDING BUT IN HER CASE THE BUDDHA'S CLOTTING EVERYWHERE AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY FRIGHTENING FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
BUT INTO THE DRAMATICALLY ILLUSTRATES THEIR NEED FOR DONOR BLOOD WHERE NOT ONLY IS NOT ONLY A RED CELLS
THAT'S MANUFACTURED BUT ALSO PLASMA AND PLATELETS AND WITH NATASHA HERSELF A BLOOD DONOR
AND WE'VE GOT AN AMAZING THERE ARE AMAZINGLY LOYAL AND SUPPORTIVE BLOOD DONORS WHO GIVE THEIR KICK GIVE THEIR OWN TIME AND BLOOD IN THIS MANNER BUT WE DO NEED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW DONORS EVERY YEAR TO MAINTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE BLOOD SUPPLIES FOOD AND ARE AND ARE WE KEEPING UP WITH
WE ARE BUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BECOME THE NEXT GENERATION OF DONORS AND THEY CAN REGISTER BY CALLING THREE HUNDRED ONE TWO THREE TWO THREE TWO THREE OR GOING TO BLOOD DOT CO DOT U.K. AND AS WE ALWAYS WELCOME NEW DONORS TOO
REPLENISH AND REPLACE THOSE WHO HAVE TO RETIRE AND NATASHA POLLOCK YOU WERE A BLOOD DONOR AND ONE EMERGENCY WILL CONTINUE TO BE IF YOU'RE ALLOWED TO
I HOPE I HOPE TO ONE DAY I DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT'LL BE AT THE MOMENT BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO BECAUSE YOU GET BLOOD IN YOU DON'T GET THE INSTANT GRATIFICATION YOU'VE JUST HELP THE PERSON IN FRONT OF YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE THERE THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO IN A PEOPLE OFTEN PEOPLE HAVE THAT ON MY BUCKET LIST BUT IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLY VALUABLE COMMODITY IN WITHOUT IT DOCTORS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOBS AT THEIR BEST WHICH FORTUNATELY I WAS WERE ABLE TO DO AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE SUPPLIER THEY HAD ACTUALLY DID RUN OUT
AT THIRTY NINE UNITS AND SURGERY THAT'S THAT'S WHEN IT HAD TO STOP BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MORE AVAILABLE IN THE IN THE WORCESTER COUNTY THEY'VE GONE OUT AND THEY SOURCED IT FROM EVERY DIRECTION HE POSSIBLY COULD
AND SHE RECEIVED MORE THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GIVE ME ANY MORE SO I NEGATIVE IS VERY VERY USEFUL IT'S GIVEN TO MEASURE SITUATIONS WHERE THEY HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO FIND OUT SO I WAS BLOOD TYPE AND THEY KNOW THAT THAT WOULD SAVE THEIR LIFE SO IT IS PLEASE GO AND DO IT PICK UP THE PHONE AND
AND THAT YOURSELF THEN IT'S LOVELY TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS DONORS NATASHA POLLOCK DOCTOR EDWARD MASSEY THANK YOU EXTRAORDINARY STORY ISN'T IT TWENTY NINE MINUTES PAST EIGHT NOW AND ROB IS A CHELTENHAM I AM JOHN YES WELCOME BACK TO HER WHEN IT'S A CHILLY CHELTENHAM MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES HERE TODAY FOR THE MID AFTERNOON IN THE THREE THIRTY GOLD CUP SEVEN DEGREES SELL OUT CROWD TODAY

THE WEATHER HERE WILL NOT DESERT ISLAND DISH I SUPPOSE CLOUDY AND ACTUALLY FEELING RATHER COLD YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER SAID HE HOPED TO FIND COMMON GROUND WITH EUROPE ON THE LATEST PROPOSALS TO RESOLVE THE MIGRANT CRISIS HE MADE THE COMMENTS AS HE ARRIVED AT A BREAKFAST MEETING IN BRUSSELS WHERE E.U. LEADERS LAST NIGHT AGREED NEW SAFEGUARDS WHICH IT'S HOPED WILL ENSURE THE LEGALITY OF THE PROPOSALS TO RETURN MIGRANTS IN GREECE TO TURKEY IN EXCHANGE TURKEY WILL GET FINANCIAL AID BUT WILL HAVE TO MEET STRICT CONDITIONS BEFORE ITS CITIZENS GET THESE FREE TRAVEL TO THE SHOWING IN ZONE
DETECTIVES ARE INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD INVOLVING THE POLICE FEDERATION OF ENGLAND AND WALES THE BODY WHICH REPRESENTS MOST OFFICERS NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE
THE CHARITY AS WORN THAT PEOPLE WITH AUTISM OR DYING EARLIER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION CITING RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN SWEDEN AUTISTIC OR SAYS PEOPLE WITH THE CONDITION DIE ON AVERAGE AT THE AGE OF FIFTY FOUR
THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN HAS SUGGESTED THAT PLANS IN THE BUDGET TO CUT DISABILITY BENEFITS COULD BE REVISED THE PROPOSALS TO CHANGE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS WOULD AFFECT MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DISABLED PEOPLE BY TWENTY TWENTY SOME CONSERVATIVE M.P.S HAVE THREATENED TO REBEL OVER THE MEASURES
IT'S NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE THE N.H.S. SCHOOLS THE ARMED FORCES AND THE POLICE WILL ALL HAVE TO STUMP UP MORE MONEY TO PAY INTO THEIR STAFF'S PENSIONS THAT'S WHAT THE CHANCELLOR ANNOUNCED IN HIS BUDGET LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IT'LL COST UP TO TWO BILLION POUNDS AND THAT THAT'LL COME FROM FRONTLINE SERVICES EARLIER I SPOKE TO THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER TIM FARRON
WHAT WE'VE GOT OBVIOUSLY A COUNCIL WHO ANNOUNCED THREE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS' WORTH OF CUTS IN THE BRIDGET STATEMENT EARLIER ON THIS WEEK THERE'S WALLY GAVE NO DETAIL ABOUT WHERE THAT MONEY WAS GOING TO COME FROM AT ALL WE NOW DISCOVER THAT HE AND ADDITIONALLY SNEAK THROUGH WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY ANOTHER TWO BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF KURT'S
THESE ARE THE PUBLIC SERVICE PENSION SCHEME DISCOUNT RATE CHANGES WHICH MEANS RATHER THAN THE TREASURY FUNDING TWO BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF THIS CONTRIBUTION
IT'LL BE PASSED ON DIRECT ME TO THE PLOY EARS SO THAT WILL MEAN THE N.H.S. IT'LL MEAN SCHOOLS IT WILL MEAN THE ARMED FORCES IT WILL MEAN THE POLICE FORCE AND INDEED SOME OF THE PLACES AS WELL AS NOT HONOUR IT WON'T AFFECT
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE PENSIONERS WITHIN THOSE SCHEMES WHAT IT DOES IT TAKES THAT MONEY DIRECTLY OUT OF THE FRONT LINE OF THOSE SERVICES WAS AN EXTRA TWO BILLION POUNDS PASSED ON SPECIFICALLY TO THOSE
BUT HIS HEALTH SCHOOLS ARMED FORCES AND POLICE BUT THE CHANCE THE CHOSE NOT TO ANNOUNCE AT ALL IN THE BUDGET BUT TO SNEAK THROUGH EXCEPT HE WAS VERY CLEAR IN HIS SPEECH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS SUSTAINABLE AND THIS IS A BENEFIT TO THOSE STOP SO TEACHERS NURSES THEY WILL ALL GET A BETTER PENSION AS A RESULT OF THIS
THEY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY MORE THE REALITY IS THIS IS THAT YOU'RE NOT PRIVATE PENSION SCHEMES THOUGH THESE ARE PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION SCHEMES IT'S JUST THE CHANCELLOR MOVING THE COST FROM ONE BIT OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO ANOTHER IT'S JUST SMOKE AND MIRRORS SO THE TREASURY WERE GOING TO PAINT NOW HE SAYS THE N.H.S. AND SCHOOLS
AND THE ARMED FORCES AND POLICE WILL HAVE TO PAY IT DIRECTLY SO WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR MONEY FROM THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER FORM OF INCOME ON THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY THE CHANCELLOR PERMITS COME TO HOUSE SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS TWO BILLION POUNDS OF ADDITIONAL SAVING NATIONAL COOKS FOR THE N.H.S. SCHOOLS AND SO ON WILL HAVE TO NOW MAKE IN ORDER TO AFFORD THIS
ALL OF THIS WOULD BE INTOLERABLE IF AN IFFY WAS A SITUATION WHERE HE CAN'T HAD TO DO IT BUT HE DOESN'T HE HAS CHOSEN TO SET HIMSELF TARGETS THAT ARE UNNECESSARY I WOULD ARGUE THAT IN COALITION WE GOT THE COUNTRY ALONGSIDE
IT CONSENTED TO THE CROSSROADS AND GETTING THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT REDUCED THEM DOWN TO NEXT YEAR TO NOTHING WE NOW FIND OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE HE IS MAKING CHOICES AT THAT CROSSROADS TO GO DOWN A ROAD THAT WE WOULDN'T GO
NO SENSIBLE CHANCELLOR WHO WAS TRYING TO PROTECT AND TREAT IN THE FUTURE WITH A RECORD JUST ON THIS QUESTION OF THE PENSIONS THOUGH HE MADE THE POINT IN HIS SPEECH THIS WILL NOT AFFECT ANYONE'S PENSION AND WILL BE AFFORDABLE WITHIN THEIR SPENDING PLANS THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM THE FISCAL WINDFALL OF LOWER INFLATION SO THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THERE IS MORE WRIGGLE ROOM WITHIN DEPARTMENT BUDGET
AND THEN BECAUSE OF LOWER INFLATION AND THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO SPEND ON PENSIONS WILL KNOW THAT MEAN THAT IS NONSENSE BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL WE DON'T KNOW THAT COULD BE THE CASE BY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ALL THE INDEPENDENT COMMENTATORS SINCE THE BUDGET ON WEDNESDAY HAVE INDICATED THAT ESSENTIALLY THAT EATS A MIRAGE AND SO WHAT WE HAVE YES IT MIGHT WELL BE TRUE THAT FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST THAT THOSE PEOPLE WORKING IN THE N.H.S. WILL NOT HAVE THEIR PERSONAL PENSIONS EFFECT
WHAT WILL BE AFFECTED IS WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN AFFORD TO GIVE THE WILL HAVE THOSE JOBS IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE OF THIS CAN BE FEWER DOCTORS FEWER NURSES A WORSE DEAL FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS FOR EXAMPLE FEWER TEACHERS LESS MONEY FOR SCHOOLS FEWER POLICE AND PEOPLE WHO SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN THE ARMED FORCES BEING GIVEN THEIR P. FORTY FIVE
THAT WAS TIM TALKING TO ME A LITTLE EARLIER THIS MORNING AND IT'S NOW TWENTY TO NINE IF THE SUGAR TAX THAT GEORGE OSBORNE ANNOUNCED ON WEDNESDAY DOES ITS JOB WE ALL SPECIALLY CHILDREN BE DRINKING FEWER DRINKS CRAMMED FULL OF SUGAR WE AUTOMATICALLY THINK OBVIOUSLY OF COCA COLA AND PEPSI INFANTA BUT WHAT ABOUT ENERGY DRINKS WE'RE TOLD ARE THEY GOOD FOR US AT LEAST WE USED TO BE BUT THE TRUTH IS THEY IT CONTAIN EVEN MORE SUGAR
SOMETHING LIKE COKE BOTTLE IS THE FORMER HEAD OF MARKETING AT RED BALL THE U.K. HE'S NOW THE FOUNDER OF TENZING NATURAL ENERGY SO CAN I ASSUME FROM THAT THAT YOU'VE GONE FROM BEING THE BAD GUY TO A GOOD GUYS THAT THE IS THAT THE IDEA UM WELL THE THING IS IT WAS EXACTLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I DID THIS IS TO KIND OF HELPED SOLVE THIS ISSUE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF
DRINKS WITH A LOT OF SUGAR IN THERE A LOT OF THAT INGREDIENT THAT'S WESTERLY SOMETHING LIKE RED BUT I'VE NEVER TALKED ABOUT ENERGY DRINKS PARTICULARLY AND RED BALL WAS ONE OF THE REALLY BAD ONES WASN'T IT OR IS ONE OF THE REALLY BAD ONES OR NEWMARKET HE DID FOR YEARS I KNOW WHAT I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT ONE OF THE BUT I KNOW FOR A FACT WHAT ELEVEN GRAMS OF SUGAR EXACTLY THE SAME AS COCA COLA BUT NOBODY SAYS COOK COLD AS GOOD FOR YOU THEY DID SAY THAT YOU SAID THAT A RED BALL WE NEVER SAID IT WAS GOOD FOR FOR ANYONE WE ALWAYS HAVE ALL GIVE YOU ENERGY
WELL DIFFERENCE THERE AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DRINKS OUT THERE THEY DO SAY THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOU NAME FOR INSTANCE INDUCING WATER JUICY WATER WELL THEY HAVE SIX GRAMS OF SUGAR RIGHT AND THEY'RE CALLED THEY CALL THEMSELVES JUICY WATER TWO VERY POSITIVE AND GOT TO BE SIX GRAMS SUGAR RIGHT SO THESE ENERGY DRINKS ARMOUR YOU WOULD NO LONGER ARGUE ARE GOOD FOR YOU I MEAN IN ANY SENSE THAT YOU WOULDN'T YOU WOULDN'T SAY TO A KID
SETTING OUT FOR A GAME OF RUGBY OR SOMETHING AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF CANS OF THIS ANY LOVE LOADS OF ENERGY YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT WHAT THE ENERGY I MEAN HE WAS ON THE FOOD AND WRAP THE OTHER DAY THAT YOU DOES GIVE YOU ENERGY SO THAT'S THE KEY IS THAT IT GIVES YOU ENERGY BUT THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT FIRST OF ALL IT'S THE SYNTHETIC INGREDIENTS THERE'S A LOT OF THE SYNTHETIC INGREDIENTS IN THESE PRODUCTS AND SECOMBE IS THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR SO THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WERE TENZING WE WANTED TO TACKLE IS TAKE HER UP THE SUGAR TAKE HALF THE SUGAR OUT AND HAVE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT NATURAL INGREDIENTS ARE THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT MOST
AND THAT IS NOT VERY DIFFERENT THAN MOST OTHER SOFT DRINKS THE LOADS OF SUGAR IN THERE RIGHT BUT BUT BUT THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THESE ENERGY DRINKS SHOULD NOT BE MARKETED IN THE WAY THAT I'M THE FACT IS THE MARKETING THING IS A BIT BIZARRE ISN'T IT I DID THAT SORT OF ATTACHED TO SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT SORT OF
A PRODUCT IN AND OF THEMSELVES A KIND OF YOU HAVOC WHOLE CAMPAIGN A WHOLE WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE OLD PROGRAMME OR SOMETHING AND THEN YOU ATTACH THE ENERGY RING TO IT SO IT'S WORKED OVER THE YEARS ISN'T EXACTLY EXACTLY IT'S INTERESTING COS IT'S A VERY VERY MARKETING LED BUSINESS I AGREE AND I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME BECAUSE HE SEE WHAT WHAT HAPPENS MORE AND MORE ALSO IN LET'S SAY THE BEER MARKET OF THE GYM MARKET YOU SEE A LOT OF CRAFT COMING UP AT THE MOMENT SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY MOVING AWAY FROM THESE MASSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS MORE MORE AND LOOKING AT THE PRODUCT MORE AND LOOKING ON THE BACK OF THE CAR LOOKING ON THE BACK OF OF A BOTTLE TO SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THERE AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT TREND BECAUSE WHAT WE TEND TO DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING WITH SUGAR
BECAUSE IT'S SURE AND PEOPLE LOVE SURE THAT'S A FACT PEOPLE GO OH I KNOW I HATE WE'VE BEEN CONDITIONED TO LOOK AT ME BUT ANY EXACTLY IS THAT AND I AGREE WITH THAT SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO THAT'S ALSO THE WORST THAT'S I THINK I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT WITH THE SUGAR TAX COS I DON'T AGREE AND ALL THAT SURE REPLACEMENTS BECAUSE THAT JUST FEEDS EXACTLY THAT RIGHT SO WHERE SHOULD WE GO WE SHOULD LOWER THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR
RUN NOT REPLACE IT WITH ANYTHING AND YOU'LL DO THE ENERGY DRINKS AS THEY STAND OF BOB BAD YOU DISPUTE THAT LONGER I THEY AREN'T THEY ARE BAD THEY SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY YOU SOW YOUR OWN BRAND CLEARLY DEFINITELY BUT BUT BUT THAT ASIDE THE SORT OF DRINK THIS IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE YOU HAVE ENERGY DRINKS IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE ENERGY DRINKS WITHOUT
A LOT OF SUGAR'S GONNA BE SOME CLEARLY IT WITHOUT A LOT OF IT AT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT POSSIBLE AND I THINK IT'S SO THAT'S WHAT I DID IT'S IN THE THING IS IF YOU HAVE A YOU NEED A BIT OF SUGAR SO YOU NEED ABOUT BE SO IN MY PRODUCT IS ABOUT FIVE GRAMS OF SUGAR
BRANDED A MEL PHIL SEEMS A LOT WHEN I GO ON ARE YOU THERE WERE YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING THAT'S LOWER THAN THAT AND IT'S JUST ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF ENERGY BUT IT'S NOT ME IT'S HAD THOSE AND BIG AMOUNT SOMETHING LIKE LUCAS AID FOR INSTANCE HAS EVEN MORE COS THEY'RE ALSO A BIG BOTTLES SO IS HUGE AMOUNTS OF SUGARS IN THERE RIGHT WHICH
THEY SHOULD REALLY BE LOOKED AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED HER VOCAL ABOUT WE WERE SAYING AS WELL WHEN WE LOOKED AT A TEASPOON OF SUGAR IS FOUR GRAMS IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE SUMS AS YOU LOOK AT THE BACK
NOW A QUARTER TO NINE BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT DE L'AMOUR ROOSTER OFFERED HER PREDECESSOR LULA DA SILVA A JOB AS HER CHIEF OF STAFF SO THAT HE CANNOT BE PROSECUTED

AND YESTERDAY'S EVENTS WAS THE SORT OF CLIMAX WHEN WOULD SAY IT WAS FARCICAL IF IT WASN'T SO TRAGIC FOR THIS COUNTRY UNDER PINNING A LOT OF THIS HAS BEEN A HUGE CORRUPTION SCANDAL CENTRED AROUND THE COUNTRY'S WHAT WAS THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST COMPANY INDEED SOUTH AMERICA'S LARGEST COMPANY PET FOR A BROWSE THE SEMI STATE OIL COMPANY
AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS THAT CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES WERE PAYING BRIBES TO PETRA BRAS TO GET BIG CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AND THOSE BRIBES WOULD THEN BEING PASSED ON TO POLITICAL PARTIES NOT JUST THE WORKERS PARTIES OF PRESIDENT CEF AND EX PRESIDENT LULA BUT ALSO OTHER PARTIES AND IT HAS HAD A HUGE RAMIFICATIONS THIS SCANDAL
I BELIEVE IT MIGHT BE THE LARGEST CORRUPTION CASE ANYWHERE IN IN HISTORY BECAUSE IT'S BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVOLVED OH AND IT IS DRAGGING IN ALL THESE SENIOR POLITICIANS THE SUGGESTION THOUGH HAS BEEN THAT ACTUALLY THIS JUDGE'S RELEASE THIS TRANSCRIPT IS ACTING POLITICALLY AND IT'S ALL IT'S ALL PART OF THE POLITICAL GAME THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S A VERY TENSE POLITICAL ASPECT TO THIS WHOLE THING BECAUSE THE WORKERS' PARTY OF OF THE PRESIDENT IS CLAIMING
THAT THE JUDICIARY IS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND USING ITS RHETORIC SAYING THAT THE JUDGES ARE WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE WEALTHY ELITE OF BRAZIL HOWEVER THAT SLIGHTLY UNDERMINED BY THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE CAUGHT UP IN THE SCANDAL ARE THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN BRAZIL SO TWO WEEKS AGO
ONE OF THE MOST STUNNING THING THAT HAPPENED WAS THE JAILING FOR OVER NINETEEN YEARS OF THE BILLIONAIRE MARCELLO ORDER BASED WHO OWNS THE LARGEST CONSTRUCTION COMPANY IN BRAZIL SO IF THEY ARE IF THIS IS A PLOT BY THE ELITE IT'S GOING BADLY WRONG SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THE ELITE IS ENDING UP IN IN JAIL AS WELL AS WORKERS PARTY OFFICIALS THERE ARE VERY
OUR FULL VOICES WHO ARE NOW TURNING STATE'S EVIDENCE AND THE MATERIAL THAT IS COMING OUT IS JUST DRAW JAW JAW DROPPING I'M SURE IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO IN THE WEEKS AHEAD MEESHA GLENNIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE
DETECTIVES HAVE BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD INVOLVING THE POLICE FEDERATION OF ENGLAND AND WALES A NATIONAL BODY THAT REPRESENTS MOST POLICE OFFICERS AS THAT NEWS EMERGED THE FEDERATION SAID IT'S VICE CHAIRMAN HAS RESIGNED FROM HIS POST WILL DANNY SURE HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DANNY FRAUD INVESTIGATION YES MEAN THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED STEP FOR POLICE TO BE CALLED IN TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD AT THE POLICE FEDERATION OF ENGLAND AND WALES
THEY WERE CALLED IN ON TUESDAY ALERTED BY SENIOR OFFICIALS AT THE POLICE FEDERATION AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YESTERDAY OFFICERS FROM SURREY POLICE WERE AT
THE LEATHERHEAD HEADQUARTERS OF THE POLICE FEDERATION STARTING THEIR ENQUIRIES AND IT RELATES TO WHAT IS DESCRIBED AS POTENTIAL FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY REVOLVING AROUND ACCOUNTS HELD BY THE CONSTABLE'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE THAT'S THE ORGANISATION THE SORT OF SUB ORGANISATION THAT'S MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES OF CONSTABLE'S OBVIOUSLY MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE POLICE FEDERATION
AND IT IT CENTRES ON A FUND THAT WAS SET UP BY THE CONSUL CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND HOW THAT FUND WAS ESTABLISHED AND THAT INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT SUMS OF MONEY NOW SURREY POLICE ARE SAYING THAT THEY ARE SIMPLY CONDUCTING AN INQUIRY TO SEE IF ANY OFFENCE HAS BEEN COMMITTED THEN NO ARRESTS AT THIS STAGE CLEARLY IN A EARLY STAGES OF THE INVESTIGATION AND ARE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING INVESTIGATED THE THEMSELVES POLICE OFFICERS
WELL THAT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS STAGE BUT CLEARLY THE POLICE FEDERATION AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES ARE MADE UP OF POLICE OFFICERS PREDOMINANTLY SERVING POLICE OFFICERS WHO WAS SECONDED TO THE POLICE FEDERATION AND CARRY OUT SOME OF THOSE ROLES IN SOME INSTANCES ON A FULL TIME BASIS
REACH UP THAT THAT I BEG YOUR PARDON DANNY THANK YOU DANNY SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME TEN MINUTES TO NINE JORDAN HAS LARGELY AVOIDED THE TROUBLE GRIPPING ITS NEIGHBOURS IRAQ AND SYRIA THEY'VE TAKEN IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES FROM BOTH COUNTRIES AND YET SO FAR HAVE MANAGED NOT TO IMPORT IDEAS OF VIOLENT EXTREMISM
THEY'RE AWARE OF THE DANGERS THOUGH THERE'S ARLAN CADRE THEATRICAL COMPANY IS TOURING THE COUNTRY PERFORMING A PLAY ABOUT EXTREMIS RECRUITMENT CALLED TERRORISM AT THE DOOR OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CONNELLY CAUGHT UP WITH THE PLAY IN THE CITY OF MAHON AND SAW FOR HIMSELF HOW THE ACTORS ARE TEACHING JORDANIAN TO RESIST THE MESSAGE OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE YEAH
THE FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE IDEOLOGY OF ISIS DOESN'T ALWAYS LOOK QUITE WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO LOOK LIKE WE'RE IN THE SMALL NEAT MODERN THEATRE EVERY UNIVERSITY IN THE JORDANIAN TOWN OF MARK
IT HAS A REPUTATION AS A PRETTY CONSERVATIVE AND RELIGIOUS PLACE MOST OF THE GIRLS IN THE AUDIENCE WEARING HEADDRESSES AND ONE OR TWO ARE WEARING FACE FAILS THE BORDER WITH SAUDI ARABIA'S JUST DOWN THE ROAD ACROSS THE DESERT WE'RE HERE FOR A PERFORMANCE OF TERRORISM AT THE DOOR BY THE SIR ALAN HUNTER A THEATRICAL
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DANGERS OF EXTREMISM THE ACTOR HAS CENSORED BY WAS ABOUT TO BREAK OFF FROM SOME LAST MINUTE REHEARSALS HERE TO TELL ME MORE
DECIDE TO ALLIED THERE SIMPLY TO SIMBA MESSAGES FOR THE YOUTH AT TO DIVERSITY'S DISTAL TO AT OR AVOID THE VIOLENCE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE ISIS AND ALL THAT
HE WAS THERE SO I SHALL BE THERE TO SPEAK OF TOLD TO CATCH THEY WERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE LECTURES IT'S A GLASS EYE AND THE FOOTBALLING PEOPLE AND FOR ME
I'M YELLING AT LOOK AT MY WATCH AFTER FIBRES OF THE LETTER FOR THAT I DECIDE TO LIKE THAT'S A BLUE BECAUSE IT'S INTERESTING AND WE USE THE YEAH IN THERE IT'S TIME TO SEND THE MESSAGES FOR THREE
TERRORISM IN THE DOOR AS A POWERFUL PIECE OF POLITICAL THEATRE GETTING LAUGHS AND RAISING QUESTIONS
AND IN A REGION WITH NO TRADITION OF DEMOCRACY AS A STRONG FEELING THAT GIVING YOUNG PEOPLE BETTER CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS IS AN IMPORTANT WAY TO FIGHT EXTREMISM
I CHECKED WITH SOME MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE AS THEY WERE LEAVING AND THIS DATA'S FEEL LIKE A START
THEM IN THE WAY THEY ARRIVE THERE MATTERS TO US IS WHAT THE TRUST'S RUSSELL SIMPLE I LIKE IT BECAUSE
A VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND THEY MADE YOU LOVE OF GOD
THAT'S WHAT I THINK IT IS TO SPREAD AWARENESS TO ALL THE PEOPLE TO BE AGAINST
TAS AND AS SPREADING FAST FOR THE END OF ITS FOR SAID I'M GOING TO GO AWAY
PLENTY OF YOUNG TILL DAMIEN'S ARE PREPARED TO LAUGH AT THE ABSURDITIES OF EXTREMISM ON STAGE
BUT I'VE MET OTHERS WHO WERE RATHER RESENT WHAT THEY SEE IS THE IMPRESSION IN THE WEST BUT THEY'RE ALL EASY PREY FOR EXTREMIST RECRUITERS
MY FRIENDS WERE STARTING AND BROUGHT
IS THAT ASKING AMERICANS EUROPEANS EVERYONE
THEY ASKED HIM WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT JORDAN WHAT DO YOU KNOW OVER THE MIDDLE EAST YOU KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS
I THINK WE STILL RIDE
DO YOU THINK THAT'S NOT BAD PUBLICITY YES IT IS THAT'S IGNORANT
MARIE'S PASSIN COLLEY SAYS HE CAN WORK OUT FOR HIMSELF BUT THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE DOESN'T REPRESENT THE ARAB WORLD ANY MORE THAN THE COUP KLUTZ CLAN REPRESENTS THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT COME HERE YOU KNOW YOU'RE ASKING US
ICES ICES IS JUST LIKE THE AMERICAN KICK KICK KING WHEN THEY WERE AGAINST BLACK AND THEY WERE ALL DEAD TOO WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY USE THEM AS THIEVES
YOU KNOW EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT THAT THIS IS THE SAME THING IT GITA'S NOT RICH IS AMBER
ICES THERE'S NOT IMPRISONED PIERRE WORRIED THERE'S NOT YOUR PRESENT
IS NOT QUITE LIKE ANYWHERE ELSE THE PERFORMANCE ENDED WITH THREE ROUSING CHEERS FOR THE HASH HE MIGHT ROYAL
BUT THERE IS A BROADER LESSON IN ALL OF THIS EDUCATION'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN FIGHTING EXTREMISM AND MAYBE HUMOUR IS TOO
KEVIN CONNOLLY REPORTING FIVE TO NINE SOMETHING ELSE YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE BOX PLANT CATERPILLAR AND IF YOU'RE NOT WORRIED YOU SHOULD BE THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY IS SO WORRIED IT'S PUT AT THE TOP OF ITS LATEST LIST OF THE MOST TROUBLESOME GARDEN PESTS WILL I'M JOINED BY MATTHEW CRONY OF THE R.H.S. HE'S THEIR PRINCIPLE PAN PATHOLOGIST AND BY SIMON TOOMER NATIONAL TRUST PLANTER HISTORIAN
MATTHEW MORE WORRIED ABOUT THIS THING THE SLUGS AND SNAILS AND ALL THE REST OF THEM WELL THERE THE PROBLEM WITH THE BOX TREE CATERPILLAR IS THAT'S FAIRLY NEW IN THE U.K. AT THE STATES SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO
IT WAS FIRST FOUND IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND U.K. GARDENS IT'S BEEN FOUND IN EUROPE BEFORE BUT AT FIRST TURNED UP AS A CATERPILLAR FAIRLY RECENTLY SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE DOING AT THE STAGE SO WE DO KNOW THAT IT EACH BOX PLANTS WE DO THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT WE HAVE A DOUBLE WHERE WE'VE HAD BOX BLIGHT A FUNGAL DISEASE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND IT'S THE NUMBER TO DISEASE ENQUIRY FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THERE DEFOLIATE THE BOX PLANTS AND NOW WE HAVE BOX TREE CATERPILLAR AS OUR NUMBER ONE AND FIERY
AND SO BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT BOX PLANTS ARE GROWN FOR THEIR STRETCHER FOR THE GREEN OVER THERE WENT THEY'D LOOK TIDY BUT A SINISTER DEFOLIATED THEN IT'S UNSIGHTLY AND UNFORTUNATELY BOTH THE DISEASE AND THE PIERCED CAN RESULT IN THE PLANT DYING AND THEY DO HAVE AN AMAZING HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRYSIDE
THEY DO THE NATIONAL TRUST HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED MANY OF THEM ARE YOU KNOW IMPORTANT HERITAGE FEATURES A SEVENTEENTH AND EARLY EIGHTEENTH CENTURY GARDENS WHERE BOX PROVIDES LIVING FRAMEWORK FOR THOSE FORMAL GEOMETRICAL DESIGNS THAT WE KNOW AND LOVE SO MUCH THE PARTERRES THE KNOT GARDENS BUT ALSO IN MORE RECENT MORE MODERN GARDENS THEY ALSO PROVIDE A VERY VALUABLE PLANT FROM BORDERING IN FRAMING OTHER KINDS OF PLANTING BUT THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY DEEPLY DEEPLY BORING PLANTS
YOU COULD SAY THAT IN THEMSELVES ARE THEY WHEN WHEN YOU SEE A REALLY BIG MATURE PLANT AS WE HAVE IN PLACES LIKE BOX HILL YOU KNOW IT IT CAN BE QUITE BEAUTIFUL BUT IT'S NOT IT SORT OF
IT'S NOT IT'S DIVA QUALITIES IF YOU LIKE YOU GO FOR FOR A BOX ROOM IT IS IT HAS GOT AN AMAZING SET OF CHARACTERISTICS BUT IT'S DENSE IS LONG LIVED IT'S IT'S SMALL LEAD IT'S EVERGREEN SO IT IS THAT IDEAL PLANT FOR PROVIDING THAT SOME HEDGING AND THOSE FEATURES WE WANT WHAT IS IT A PLANT WITH DIVA QUALITY PIECE I DOES AND WHAT I MEAN IT HASN'T GOT THAT I DON'T REMEMBER WELL IT'S NOT A MAG GLADIOLI OH YES ABSOLUTELY THAT'S A FLOWER THE LAST
BUT HE DOES HAVE FLOWERS I JUST VERY INCONSPICUOUS BUT IT AND IT'S A VERY DEMANDING SET OF CHARACTERISTICS WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A PLANT THAT CAN PROVIDE ALL THOSE THINGS WELL THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE ALTHOUGH I'VE GOT A VERY VERY OLD YEW HEDGE AND IT IS MAGNIFICENT IN A PART OF THE FACT THAT IT'S PEER GROUP THAT'S FLOWERS AS WELL THEY WERE ONLY A LITTLE
BUDS AND THINGS AND WHEN IT DOES IT DOES AND YOU WITH ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVE SPECIES WE THINK ABOUT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF OUR GARDENS WE'VE HAD BIG PROBLEMS WITH BOX BLIGHT AND HAVING TO THINK BOTH ABOUT HOW WE MANAGE THEM IN THE FUTURE BUT ALSO THE ALTERNATIVES FOR FOR PLANTING WHERE IT HAS BECOME SUCH A BIG PROBLEM THAT ACTUALLY IT'S MAYBE NOT A VIABLE SPECIES FOR THE FUTURE RIGHT GOING BACK TO THE THE HORRIBLE THINGS MATTHEW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS
NASTY LITTLE BOX BUT PERHAPS CATERPILLAR O. K. TOGETHER UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THEM SOME OF THE MEASURES TO CONTRADICT EACH OTHER SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN HELP HER MANAGED THE BOX THREE CATERPILLAR
POTENTIALLY MAKE THE BOX BLIGHT WORSE SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT INTEGRATING OUR STRATEGY SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN OVERALL GET BETTER BOX BUT GARDEN DESIGN AND GARDEN STRUCTURE THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE PLANT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO BE PREPARED WE NEED TO GROW BOX IN A DIFFERENT WAY IT'S HARDER IN HISTORIC GARDEN WITH US THE STRUCTURE BUT WE DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHERE WE GROW BOX HOW MUCH BOX DO WE WANT TO GROW AND A FANTASTIC BOX TOPIARY SURROUNDED BY A BY A BOX HERE
WE'RE DOUBLING THE RISK THAT WAY ALL RIGHT SO IF WE'VE GOT BOXES IN A GARDEN AND A LOT OF US HAVE WHAT DO WE DO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR JUST YOU'VE GOT ABOUT A MINUTE WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR O.K. SO THAT THE TWO DISEASES DISEASE AND THE PIERCED BOTH RESULT INTO FOLIATE SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT YOU'LL SEE FIRST THE PROBLEM IS THAT'S THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG SO WHEN YOU SEE THE LEAVES GOING YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TROUBLE AND IT'S PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IDEAL TO HAVE SPOTTED IT
HAVING A CLOSE LOOK OF BOX PLANTS LOOKING ALONG THE EAR IF YOU CATCH BOX BY YOU'LL SEE THE LEAVES FORMING A SMALL DARK LESIONS OR SMALL BROWN LESIONS THEY'LL DROP OFF AND YOU GET BLACK STREAKING ON THE STAIR RIGHT SO YOU WON'T NECESSARILY SEE THE INSECT THE SIX ALSO SO THAT WAS THE DISEASE THE N. SIT YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A WAY OF BEING TO START WITH
LEE'S LOOKING A LITTLE BIT CHEWY BUT THE WHIPPING AS PROBABLY THE FIRST THING THAT SHE WILL SEE A BIT OF PRESS FROM THE FRONT FROM THE INSECTS AND THE CATERPILLARS ARE A BIT OF ALL RIGHT TWO SECONDS CAN YOU SPRAY YOU CAN THERE ARE INSECTICIDES AND FUNGICIDES ALL RIGHT THEY SHOULD ONLY BE PART OF THE STRATEGY RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE COULD TALK FOR HOURS ABOUT THIS GOOD ME MATTHEW CHROMEY SILENCE OVER THANKS BOTH YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO THAT'S IT OUR EDITORS TOM VEILED AND ANDY BRYSON GOOD MORNING
