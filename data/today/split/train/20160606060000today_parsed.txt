RESEARCHERS SAY THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER RECURRING CAN BE CUT BY A THIRD IF PATIENTS TAKE HORMONAL DRUGS FOR TEN YEARS AND ALSO IN TODAY'S PROGRAMME WE'LL DISCUSS THE ETHICS OF GROWING HUMAN ORGANS IN PIGS FOR THIS PROVIDES AND UNLIMITED DOMAIN
YOU WOULD TELL THE PATIENT CLEAR COME BACK IN FOUR MONTHS YOUR ORGAN WILL BE
DOCUMENTARY FILM MAKER MICHAEL MOORE TELLS US WHY BERNIE SANDERS IS TAKING AMERICA TO THE LEFT AND COULD HAVE BEEN A MAN WHO CALLS HIMSELF A SOCIALIST IN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA I
FORTY SIX PERCENT OF ALL THE DELEGATES TO THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AND BEFORE THE END OF THE PROGRAMME
WE DON'T DO THAT OFTEN DO IT WILL DISCUSS THE SPIRITUAL AND THE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF SILENCE AND HOW WE CAN FIND IT IN EVERY DAY LIFE BEFORE ALL OF THAT THE B.B.C. NEWS READ BY CORACLE FEEL
LEADING BREAKS IT CAMPAIGNERS HAVE CLAIM TO VOTE TO REMAIN COULD MEAN BRITAIN HAS TO PAY BILLIONS OF POUNDS MORE TOWARDS THE EUROPEAN UNION THE REMAIN SIDE HAS DISMISSED THE IDEA THE TENSION'S RISING IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS THE REFERENDUM APPROACHES DAVID CAMERON IS TO JOIN FORCES WITH LEADING FIGURES FROM LABOUR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS AND THE GREENS TO ATTACK THE LEAF CAMPAIGN HE'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN
BELIEVE CAMPAIGN A BORIS JOHNSON HAS DESCRIBED A TRIPLE WHAMMY OF WAS OVER BUT HE SAYS WOULD COST THE U.K. BILLIONS OF POUNDS IN THE EVENT OF A VOTE TO REMAIN INSIDE FAME'S BRITAIN COULD BE EXPOSE FIRSTLY TO A FUTURE EUROZONE BAILOUT AND TO INCREASES IN THE CURRENT E.U. BUDGET AS WELL AS BEING FORCED TO CONTRIBUTE TWO AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS TO PLUG AN APPARENT BLACK HOLE IN THE EAVES FINANCES
BUT THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAVE DESCRIBED THE CLAIMS AS NONSENSE THE FIGURES DO NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE U.K.'S VETO ON ANY PROPOSED BUDGET INCREASE NOR IS ANY STORE PUT BY THE AGREEMENT WITH THE E.U. LEADERS THAT BRITAIN WILL NOT CONTRIBUTE TO BAIL OUTS FOR EUROZONE COUNTRIES
SCIENTISTS IN CALIFORNIA HOW USING A CONTROVERSIAL TECHNIQUE TO CREATE HUMAN ORGANS BY GROWING THEM INSIDE PIGS THEY'VE INJECTED HUMAN STEM CELLS INTO PIG EMBRYOS TO PRODUCE COMBINED HUMAN PIG EMBRYO WAS KNOWN AS CHIMERAS SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE ANIMALS COULD PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO THE WORLDWIDE SHORTAGE OF HUMAN ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT BUT OTHERS SAY THE RESEARCH RAISES ETHICAL CONCERNS BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT HUMAN CELLS MIGHT HAVE ON THE PIGS OUR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT FERGUS WASH REPORTS
RESEARCHERS ALTERED THE D.N.A. OF PIG EMBRYOS USING WHAT'S KNOWN AS GENE EDITING TO REMOVE THE INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE A PANCREAS THEN THEY INJECTED HUMAN STEM CELLS IN THE HOPE THAT THESE WILL FILL THE GENETIC VOID AND GROW A HUMAN PANCREAS INSTEAD
THE SAME TECHNIQUE MIGHT ENABLE OTHER ORGANS TO BE GROWN FOR TRANSPLANT IF CELLS WERE TAKEN FROM PATIENTS THEN THE RESULTING ORGANS COULD BE TISSUE MATCHED TO PREVENT REJECTION THE RESEARCH IS STILL AT THE EARLY STAGES AND AS YET NO HUMAN PIG EMBRYOS HAVE BEEN BORN
YOU CAN SEE MORE ABOUT THIS ON PANORAMA TONIGHT AT EIGHT THIRTY ON B.B.C. ONE AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AND ABOUT NINE INJURED IN A CRASH INVOLVING TWO TRAIN SOME EASTERN BELGIUM A SPOKESMAN FOR THE RAIL NETWORK SET A PASSENGER SERVICE CRASHED INTO THE BACK THERE GOOD STRAIN NEAR THE CITY OF THE AGE

A LANDMARK STUDY IN THE U.S. AND CANADA HAS SHOWN THAT TAKING HORMONE DRUGS FOR UP TO TEN YEARS CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF BREAST CANCERS RETURNING THE FINDINGS HAVE BEEN WELCOMED BY CANCER RESEARCHERS BUT THERE'S A WARNING THAT THE DRUGS INCREASED RISK OF BONE FRACTURES HIS I FOR REPORTER JAMES GALLAGHER
NEARLY TWO MILLION WOMEN ARE DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER AROUND THE WORLD EACH YEAR MOST HAVE A CANCER THAT'S FUELLED BY THE FEMALE SEX HORMONE OESTROGEN AROMA IMITATES INHIBITORS WHICH STOP OESTROGEN PRODUCTION ARE TAKEN FOR FIVE YEARS TO STOP THE CANCER COMING BACK SOME WOMEN ALSO TOOK OTHER HORMONAL DRUGS BEFORE STARTING ON AROMA TASTE INHIBITORS SAID THEY COULD BE SPENDING FIFTEEN YEARS ON HORMONAL TREATMENT EXPERTS FROM THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY IN THE INSTITUTE OF CANCER RESEARCH SO THE FINDINGS WERE A BIG DEAL AND COULD CHANGE TREATMENT FOR MILLIONS OF WOMEN
RESEARCHERS FROM CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY SAYING ANXIETY IT'S A SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM WHICH NEEDS FAR GREATER ATTENTION THEY WORK HAS CONFIRMED THAT WOMEN ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED AS WELL AS PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE
A VETERAN LOYALIST IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS DUE TO APPEAR IN COURT THIS MORNING CHARGED WITH MURDERING TWO CATHOLIC WORKMEN HERE IN BELFAST IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND NINETEEN NINETY ONE WINSTON RAY WHO'S SIXTY FIVE WAS ARRESTED AFTER POLICE GAINED ACCESS TO INTERVIEWS WHO RECORDED WITH AMERICAN RESEARCHERS FOR AN ORAL HISTORY PROJECT

ALI MUTT BULL REPORTING THERE IT IS FIVE PAST SIX LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE B.B.C. WEATHER CENTRE BEN RICH IS WAITING FOR US THERE MORNING MORNING TO YOU NICK WELL YESTERDAY WAS THE WARMEST DAY OF THE YEAR SO FAR MADDOCK IN NORTH WEST WALES GOT UP TO TWENTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT DEGREES IT CERTAINLY FEELS LIKE SUMMER NOW AND THERE IS PLENTY MORE WARMTH AND SUNSHINE TO COME TODAY ALBEIT WITH A THREAT OF SOME SHOWERS BREAKING OUT AND SOME OF THOSE COULD BE HEAVY
THUNDERY BUT I'LL BEGIN TODAY'S FORECAST ACROSS SOUTH WEST ENGLAND AND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND'S HERE A FEW PATCHES OF LOW CLOUD AND THE ODD FOG PATCH FIRST THING BUT THEY WILL CLEAR VERY QUICKLY TO LEAVE A MOSTLY FINE AND DRY DAY WITH SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE I'LL BE A LITTLE PATCHY CLOUD AROUND AT TIMES JUST THE SMALL RISK OF A SHOWER BUT THE VAST MAJORITY WILL BE DRY WITH HIGHS OF TWENTY DEGREES IN PLYMOUTH AND TWENTY FOUR IN LONDON
NOW FOR WALES FOR NORTH WEST ENGLAND ALSO FOR NORTHERN IRELAND'S AND FOR SOUTH WEST SCOTLAND PLENTY OF SUNNY SPELLS HERE THROUGH THE DAY BUT THERE CERTAINLY IS THE RISK OF SOME HEAVY DOWNPOURS BREAKING OUT IN THESE AREAS PARTICULARLY AFTERNOON I THINK THE LATE AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY WHEN WE COULD SEE SOME THUNDERY SHOWERS SOME HAIL MIXED IN COULD SEE A LOT OF WATER FALLING FROM THE SKY IN A SHORT SPACE OF TIME DESPITE THAT THOUGH VERY WARM TODAY TWENTY THREE DEGREES IN CARDIFF TWENTY FIVE FOR BELFAST AND GLASGOW TWENTY SEVEN IN MANCHESTER
NOW FOR THE MIDLANDS FOR EASTERN ENGLAND FOR NORTH EAST ENGLAND ALSO EASTERN AND NORTHERN SCOTLAND THE ODD FOG PATCH AND PATCH OF LOW CLOUD FIRST THING FOR MOST THAT WILL CLEAR TO LEAVE A FINE DAY WITH LOTS OF SUNSHINE IT WAS A LITTLE MORE CLOUD FOR NORTH SEA COASTS SO JUST SEVENTEEN DEGREES FOR ABERDEEN AND NEWCASTLE BUT TWENTY FIVE IN BIRMINGHAM A FEW SHOWERS CONTINUE IN WESTERN AREAS OVERNIGHT BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY IT WILL BE DRY
THANK YOU SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND LOOK AT THE PAPERS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES AN INTERESTING STORY ABOUT BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES U.K. SPECIAL FORCES THE TIME SAYS TAKE FRONTLINE ROLE IN SYRIA THERE TIME SAYS THAT
THEY'RE DEFENDING A REBEL UNIT THAT IS COMING UNDER DAILY ATTACK FROM SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THIS IS WHAT MILITARY COMMANDERS HAVE TOLD THE TIMES IS THE FIRST TIME THAT PAPER SAYS THAT THERE'S PROPER EVIDENCE OF THEIR TROOPS DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN FIGHTING INSIDE SYRIA
TIMES REPORTED LAST WEEK THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES INSIDE LIBYA HAD DESTROYED TWO SUICIDE VEHICLES NEAR MISS RATA DEMONSTRATING THAT DESPITE HAVING A TRAINING INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AN ADVISORY ROLE THEY ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN COMBAT WELL OF COURSE THE RULES ARE
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO PARLIAMENT TO HAVE SPECIAL FORCES ENGAGING IN COMBAT UNLIKE REGULAR TROOPS IT DOESN'T REQUIRE PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL BUT NONETHELESS AT THE TIMES AND DRAWS ATTENTION TO THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES ARE INVOLVED IN COMBAT ROLES IN A WAY THAT IS CONCERNING
SIGNS OF THE PAPERS MANY OF THEM WANT TO AVOID PUTTING THE REFERENDUM ON THEIR FRONT PAGE THERE SUDDENLY I THE MIRROR STILL LEADING ON SOME DRAMATIC PICTURES PICTURES OF MUHAMMAD ALI EITHER AS A YOUNG MAN OR ALI AT THE END IS THE HEADLINE ON THE SUN FOR A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE ID THE LAST PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN BEFORE HE DIED THE GUARD IN THE TELLING OF JUDO LEAD ON THE E.U. CAMPAIGN UNIONS WARN OF BRECK'S IT THREAT TO WORKING RIGHTS IS THE GUARDIAN'S HEADLINE A LETTER'S BEEN WRITTEN TO THEM BY THE LEADERS OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST TRADE UNIONS
IN A PLEA FROM THE LEADERS OF UNITE UNISON THE G.N.P. AND US DOOR BUT THE TORIES WOULD QUOTES NEGOTIATE AWAY OUR RIGHTS IF THE U.K. DID DECIDE TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE TELEGRAPH COMES AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF COURSE CAMERON JOINS LEFT IN ATTACK ON BORIS IS THEIR HEADLINE BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER WILL SHARE A PLATFORM WITH LABOUR'S HARRIET HARMAN TODAY THE LEADER OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IN THE GREENS TWO AND ACCUSED THE OTHER SIDE
OF RED ATTACKING THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY PERPETUATING AN ECONOMIC CON TRICK ON THE BRITISH PEOPLE AS THE QUOTE I JUST A BRIEF ONE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SIN OTHER PAPERS AS WELL LOSING WEIGHT IS THE BEST WAY TO
FIGHT CANCER NEWLY DIAGNOSED CANCER PATIENTS SHOULD BE TOLD TO DIET AND EXERCISE ARE MEANT MOUNTING EVIDENCE THE PAPER SAYS THAT SHEDDING THE POUNDS IS ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT THE DISEASE THIS IS A SUGGESTION FROM GLOBAL X.
TEN PAST SIX A VETERAN AMERICAN PHOTOJOURNALISTS AND HIS AFGHAN TRANSLATOR HAVE BEEN KILLED WHILST TRAVELLING WITH AN AFGHAN ARMY UNIT IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF HELMAND AFGHAN OFFICIALS SAID THAT DAVID GILKEY WHO WORK FOR N. P. A NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO IN THE U.S. AND HIS TRANSLATOR BOWLER TO MANA DIED WHEN THEIR VEHICLE WAS HIT BY A ROCKET DURING THE TALIBAN AMBUSH N.P.L. SAID MY GILKEY WAS DEVOTED TO HELPING THE PUBLIC SEE WALLS AND THE PEOPLE CAUGHT UP
IN THEM SPEAKING ON THE RADIO STATION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN MY GILKEY DESCRIBED HIS VOCATION
IT'S A MATTER OF USING AND USING COMPOSITION AND USING THE SKILLS THAT YOU HAVE AS A PHOTOGRAPHER TO BETTER SIMPLIFY THAT IMAGE
NOT JUST REPORTING IT'S NOT JUST TAKING PICTURES IT'S DO THOSE PRODUCTS
DO THE VISUALS DO THE STORIES DO THEY CHANGE SOMEBODY'S MIND ENOUGH TO TO TAKE ACTION IT IS A FASCINATING IDEA A RADIO STATION WITH ITS OWN PHOTOGRAPHER I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO HENRI SHAPIRO FORMER M.P. OUR LONDON CORRESPONDENT WHO'D RECENTLY BEEN ON A TRIP
WITH WHOM HE WAS PHYSICALLY IMPOSING AND YET HE HAD SUCH A GENTLE AIR ABOUT THEM HE HAD THIS VERY KIND OF SLOW GENTLE ENERGY AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU THINK OF AWARDS ON LIKE AFGHANISTAN HE HAD BEEN GOING THERE FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS HIS FIRST TRIP TO AFGHANISTAN
NINE ELEVEN YOU WENT ON AT HULL BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET INTO AFGHANISTAN BACK THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD GET PERMISSION AND SO HE KNEW THE STORIES SO WELL THE CULTURE OF THE PEOPLE HE WAS REPORTING ON HE KNEW THE DYNAMICS NOT ONLY OF THE U.S. MILITARY THE BRITISH MILITARY THE AFGHAN MILITARIA BUT OF THE VARIOUS TRIBES AND CULTURE AS THAT OF SWIRLED THROUGH THE COUNTRY THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GROW EM AND UNCOVER THE STORIES WITH HIS CAMERA
THAT WERE A DEEPER THAN ALMOST ANY REPORTER I KNOW DID YOU R.E. FOR EVER FIND IT CURIOUS THE IDEA OF HAVING A PHOTOGRAPHER WITH YOU GIVEN THAT YOU'RE USED TO PAINTING IMAGES IN THE MINDS OF YOUR LISTENERS
NOT AT ALL BECAUSE BEFORE I WORKED WITH DAVID I ADMIRED HIS WORK AND SO I LISTEN TO STORIES ON THE RADIO AND THEN I WOULD GO TO THE M.P. A WEB IT GENTLY OR YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE HIS PHOTOS THERE NOW AND I KNEW THE LEVELS OF DEPTH THAT HIS IMAGES WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL I STARTED TO WORK WITH THEM WAS HOW SEAMLESSLY IN CAILEAG DRILL THE COORDINATES WITH A RADIO REPORTER BECAUSE OF COURSE WHEN YOU HAVE A MICROPHONE ON THE CLICKING OF A CAMERA IN THE BACKGROUND AS THE WORST POSSIBLE
THEN THE TRICK TAKES YOU OUT OF THE SCENE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET WITH THE AUDIO AND SO AS WE WOULD BE CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS TO A TRANSLATOR HE KNEW THE PART OF THE INTERVIEW THAT I WOULD NEVER NEED TO USE WAS WHEN OUR INTERPRETER WAS ASKING MY QUESTION IN THE LOCAL LANGUAGE AND THAT WAS WHEN HE WOULD SHOOT THE PHOTOGRAPHS AND IT DIDN'T MATTER IF IT WAS
YOU KNOW ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND WE WERE IN A STAIGH FON LITTLE MUD HUT HE STAYED THERE TO GET THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE BEAM OF SUNLIGHT COMING THROUGH THE ROOF AND LANDING ON THE MAN'S HAND HOLDING THESE PRECIOUS GRAINS OF RICE THAT'S ONE IMAGE FROM OUR TRIP LAST MONTH AN INDIA THAT WILL JUST STAY WITH ME ARI SHAPIRA THERE OF N.P.R. AND THEY ARE DRAMATIC PHOTOGRAPHS YOU CAN SEE THEM ON M.P. PILLS WEBSITE I THINK WILLING TO THEM LATER AS WELL
THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX WOMEN ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE ANXIETY AS MEN ACCORDING TO RESEARCH FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE JEN DRAPER'S A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANXIETY HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT PANIC ATTACKS CHECK THINGS LIKE THAT YES I MEAN THIS IS MORE THAN JUST THE ORDINARY WORRIED THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE ABOUT GOING BACK TO WORK ON A MONDAY MORNING THIS IS SOMETHING DEEP SEATED WHICH CAN REALLY AFFECT LIVES TO THE POINT WHERE YOU HAVING PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS
THINGS LIKE CHEST PAINS A RACING HEART OR INSOMNIA AND YES WOMEN ARE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY ANXIETY AS MEN THIS RESEARCH FOUND IT WAS A BIG GLOBAL REVIEW OF LOTS OF OTHER STUDIES AND REVIEWS SO IT'S PRETTY SOLID THEY DECIDE WHY WELL IT'S NOT IN THE PAPER ITSELF BUT WHEN I TALK TO THE RESEARCH THAT SHE THOUGHT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THEORIES
WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP ANXIETY AS A RESPONSE TO STRESS MEN ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE STUDIES TEND TO BE MORE LIKELY TO TURN TO DRINK AND DRUGS IN STRESSFUL SITUATIONS AND ALSO IT'S THOUGHT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING BIOLOGICAL OR SORT OF EVOLUTIONARY SURVIVAL FUNCTION MAKING WOMEN MORE REACTIVE STRESSIN GENERAL GOING TO THEIR TRADITIONAL ROLE AS CARERS
THEY ALSO FIND THE CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH IS THAT THE PROBLEM IS WORSE IN WESTERN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA ANOTHER OTHER THOSE PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE IN A SORT OF FACETIOUS WHERE YOU COULD SAY I SHALL WE HAVE LESS TO WORRY ABOUT OTHER PLACES WHERE WE WE WORRY MOST WILL HAVE THESE ATTACKS THEM
YES I MEAN THE FIGURES FOR NORTH AMERICA WERE QUITE ASTONISHING AS MANY AS EIGHT PER CENT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AND I'M EXPERIENCING ANXIETY AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIVES SO VERY STRIKING AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND OVERALL EXPLANATIONS FOR PERHAPS THE USE THE WOOL EXACTLY IT IS SUGGEST DOESN'T IT THAT IT IS CULTURE THAT IT'S ENVIRONMENTAL
IT'S THAT COULD WELL BE AT SOMETHING THEY DON'T REALLY EXPLORE THAT I THINK ONE THING THAT WAS INTERESTING IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT THINK OF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THERE WAS A LOT MORE OF IT NOW THAN THERE WAS BUT THEY DID FIND THAT THE OVERALL PROPORTION OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY ANXIETY AROUND THE WORLD HAVE REMAINED LARGELY UNCHANGED DURING THE PAST TWO DECADES THERE SAYING THIS IS REALLY THIS WHOLE FIELD IS WHERE DEPRESSION WAS TEN TWENTY YEARS AGO WE DON'T QUITE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT YET JANE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE TALK MORE ABOUT IT AKHTAR TWENTY PAST
TIME NOW IS A QUARTER PAST SIX AND WE'VE HAD A U. TURN FROM THE BOSS OF SPORTS DIRECT MIKE ASHLEY MAY REMEMBER HE SAID HE WOULDN'T APPEAR IN FRONT OF HIM BEES LUCY BUT HE'S HERE WITH THAT THE REST THE BUSINESS NEWS HE WILL MARRY LUCY THANKS NECK YES HE WILL NOW REMINDER OF COURSE HE WAS SUMMONED IN FRONT OF THE BUSINESS SELECT COMMITTEE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WORKING CONDITIONS AT THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS
THERE ARE SEVERAL ALLEGATIONS IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND ON THE B.B.C.'S INSIDE OUT SHOW THAT LIFE FOR PEOPLE WORKING THERE WAS WELL PRETTY INTOLERABLE FINDS TURNING UP LATE CONSTANT MONITORING SEVENTY SIX AMBULANCES CALLED OUT TO THE FACTORY IN THE SPACE OF TWO YEARS FIRST OF ALL THE BOSS MIKE ASHLEY REFUSED TO APPEAR IN FRONT OF EM PEAS THEN HE SAID HE'D ONLY ANSWER QUESTIONS IF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS VISITED THE SPORTS DIRECT FACTORY IN DERBYSHIRE
AT THE END OF LAST WEEK HE SAID HE WOULDN'T ATTEND THE HEARING BECAUSE AS LAWYER FOR WASN'T FREE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS MORNING THAT HE HAS CAPITULATED AND WILL FACE QUESTIONS FROM M.P.S TOMORROW HE SAYS HE'S WE CONSIDERED BECAUSE HIS FIRM HAS NOTHING TO HIDE WILL DAVID COMING AS HEAD OF U.K. EQUITIES AT STANDARD LIFE INVESTMENT'S GOOD MORNING DAVID MORNING IT'S NOT WISE TO MARK THESE SELECT COMMITTEES AROUND IS IT WHY DO YOU THINK HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND
THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION I THINK I THINK PROBABLY THINK SO UNDER PRESSURE THE PROBABLY BEEN DOING THE RIGHT THINGS AND SPORTS DIRECT HAVE SOME HAVE ADDRESS SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT SELECT COMMITTEE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SO ZERO CONTRACTS ARE GOING MORE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THOSE CONTRACTS AS NO IT'S CLOSE LIBERTY IN TERMS OF PREVENTING EMPLOYEES WHO ARE WORKING FOR THE COMPANY
THE REVIEW THE CONDITIONS OF THE EMPLOYEES UNDER THE AGENCY CONTRACT TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE CONTROVERSIAL WORKING PRACTICES HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT AND THEY'VE AGREED TO PAY WORKERS AN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM WAGE SO I THINK HE'S PROBABLY THINKS HE CAN DEFEND THE COMPANY IN THE FACE OF THEIR ACTIONS HE'S TAKEN AND SOME OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE PRETTY STRONG WEREN'T THERE BUT THE STANDARD LIFE HAS BEEN ROUND THE SHARP AT FETCHING DAD WE HAVE WHAT DID YOU GUYS MAKE OF IT
I MEAN AS A WAREHOUSE AND OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO BE SCEPTICAL BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TO ACCEPTABLE WE THOUGHT THE ISSUES WERE BEING ADDRESSED WE DIDN'T SEE ANY CONDITIONS WERE EXCESSIVELY ONEROUS AND WE WERE AWARE THEY'VE GOT THESE CONTROVERSIAL SEARCH PRACTICES IN TERMS OF BEING MALE DETECTIVES TO CHECK THAT EMPLOYERS AREN'T TAKING THE KIT HOME SORT OF THING BUT
WE FELT THAT THE FACTORY WAS
WAS FINE THERE WEREN'T ANY MAJOR ISSUES THAT WE COULD IDENTIFY SO WHEN HE APPEARS IN FRONT OF EM TOMORROW WHAT ARE THE SHAREHOLDERS GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR HOW THEY'LL BE REACTING TO THE OF HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK WELL I THINK THE KEY IS THAT HE DEFENDS A COMPANY THAT HE
HE'D MOVED FORWARD OF THE POLICY OF PERFORM ON WILL BE UNDER PRESSURE IMPROVING THEIR WORKING PRACTICES FOR THE BENEFIT OF EMPLOYEES AN AGENCY WORKERS WHICH IS AN ISSUE I THINK INSURE BREAK AND AS IMPORTANT FROM A SHAREHOLDER PERSPECTIVE AND THE GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE
THE COMPANY FALLING APPROPRIATE WORKING PRACTICES THAT'S GOOD FOR THE COMPANY THAT'S GOOD FOR EMPLOYERS AND ALSO I THINK ATTRACTS CUSTOMERS TO THE COMPANY SO I THINK YOU NEED TO DEFEND THE COMPANY AND MAKE SURE HE'S APPLYING APPROPRIATE WORKING PRACTICES AT SPORTS IT NOW THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE IN RIGHT HAS BEEN SUGGESTING THAT MY SHE WAS FRIGHTENED TO GIVE EVIDENCE AND POINTED OUT THAT SIR PHILIP GREEN OF B.A. FORMALLY OF B.H.S. IS GOING TO GO IN TO DISCUSS THAT COMPANY LATER THIS MONTH BUT I WAS WANTING TO SOME OF THESE BOSSES FEEL LIKE
MAYBE THIS EITHER SLIGHTLY ABOVE THIS KIND OF PARLIAMENTARY GRILLING OR THEY ARE A BIT WORRIED ABOUT BEING MADE TO LOOK BAD WELL THEY SHOULDN'T FEEL ABOVE IT IN MY VIEW I THINK THE SELECT COMMITTEE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO BE FAIR AND AVOID SORT OF MISTOOK MCCARTHY STOWE POLITICAL POINT SCORING AND THAT'S ALWAYS A POTENTIAL ISSUE BUT I THINK OVERALL THE SELECT COMMITTEES
I'VE GOT IMPORTANT FUNCTION TO PERFORM IN TERMS OF HOLDING COMPANIES TO CURRENT AND AS LONG AS THE PLY EITHER PROFESSIONALLY I THINK IT'S JUSTIFIED AND I THINK COMPANIES SHOULD ATTEND
ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU THAT'S ABOUT PENSIONS BECAUSE IT'S HEADLINES HAVE BEEN HUGGED IN RECENT WEEKS WHERE PENSION SCHEMES OF B.H.S. AND CUT HER STILL AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DEFICITS THOSE DEFICITS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR OWNERS LOOKING TO SELL THEIR BUSINESSES BUT IN FACT LOTS OF THE U.K.'S PRIVATE SECTOR PENSION SCHEMES ARE RUNNING TO DEATHS AREN'T THEY IS THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT
I THINK IT IS AN ISSUE I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ISN'T TALKED ABOUT MUCH AS A LOT OF THIS PENSION FROM DEATHS AS A FUNCTION OF LOW BOND YIELDS AND LOWER YIELDS AND CORPORATE CREDIT WHICH MEANS EFFECT WITH THE DISCOUNT RATE PENSION OBLIGATIONS IS NO VERY LOW IT'S FALLEN SO THAT'S LED TO A RISE IN THEIR DEATHS AT NUMBER AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM COME IS LIKE BEAUTY FACE
IF BORN DUELS WERE TO RISE OR NORMALISE A LOT OF COMPANIES DEFERENCE WOULD DISAPPEAR BECAUSE A DISCRIMINATION IN THE FUTURE OBLIGATIONS WE'D ACTUALLY RISE IN THE PENSION NUMBER WOULD FALL OF THE DEATHS AT THEM WOULD FALL SO RISING BORN ECONOMIC GROWTH AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS LIKE RISING EQUITY MARKETS WOULD HELP IN THIS INSTANCE DAVID COMING THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO STICK WITH PENSION DEFICITS AND B.T. BECAUSE WITH ME IN THE STUDIO IS GUY PEDDIE TELECOMS ANALYST AT THE QUARRY
NOW YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE B.T. PENSION DEFICIT A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFULLY AND YOU'VE GOT FIGURES OUT SAYING THE DEFICITS ROCKED FROM FIFTY PERCENT TO MORE THAN TEN BILLION POUNDS AND EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO LET'S PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT HOW BIG IS THIS COMPARED TO OTHER PRIVATE PENSIONS
B.T.'S IS IF NOT THE BIGGEST DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BIGGEST HIT HE'S A FUN THAT'S VALUED IN OVER FORTY BILLION AND THIS IS JUST A DIFFERENCE OF SEEING WHAT IS THE FUTURE
POTENTIAL MET PRESENT VALUE TO LIABILITIES AND THAT FUN AND THERE'S JUST PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WITH THE LOW INTEREST RATES CURRENTLY THAT FUTURE LIABILITY HAS HEARD THAT SHE
IS THIS JUST ALL BECAUSE OF INTEREST RATES IS A COMBINATION OF THINGS THE ONE ADVANTAGE WITH MODERN DAY HEALTH SYSTEMS PEOPLE LIVING LONGER THAT'S A CONTRIBUTIVE FACTOR COS PEOPLE THEREFORE REQUIRE A PENSION FOR MORE YEARS THERE IS ALSO AN ELEMENT OF WHERE YOU'VE PUT YOUR ASSETS OR WHERE THE PENSION FUND IS ACTUALLY INVESTED AND WHAT YOU TEND TO FIND IS A LOT OF PENSION FUNDS HAVE GOT A RELATIVELY SMALL PART IN EQUITIES BEAUTIES
A PENSION SCHEME IS ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT SO IT DOESN'T HAVE A HUGE POSITIVE LEAD FRIDGE TWO TO GROWING ASSET RETURNS SO WHILST WE'VE INTEREST RATES GO UP THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THE LIABILITY DOES COME DOWN THERE'S ALSO AN ELEMENT OF NATURAL HEDGING BUT THEY'VE GOT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS THAT HE WILL NEVER GET BACK DOWN TO ZERO SO IF I'M LISTENING TO THIS AND I WORK AT B.T. SHOULD I BE WORRIED NOT REALLY BECAUSE B. T.
HE'S A VERY SUSTAINABLE VERY PROFITABLE COMPANY DOES GENERATE LOTS OF RETURNS HAS AN ACTIVE PLAN IN PLACE
TO TRY AND MITIGATE THAT THAT DEFICITS IT'S CURRENTLY GOT A THIRTEEN YEAR PLAN WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT PLAN MIGHT HAVE TO BE SCALED UP BUT THERE IS ALREADY AN EXISTING PLAN THEY'VE RECOGNISED IT IS ALREADY A CHALLENGE FOR THEM AND THEY ARE AWARE OF THAT BUT THEN IT IS A VERY PROFITABLE BUSINESS AND THEREFORE HAS THE CASH FLOWS TO CONTINUE TO MANAGE THEIR WAY THROUGH THIS ISSUE WHICH
WILL PROBABLY LAST FOR MANY MANY MORE YEARS GO TEDDY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WELL IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RELY ON YOUR PENSION THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER OPTION SET UP YOUR OWN BUSINESS IT'S SOMETHING OF A GROWING TREND AMONGST THE OVER FIFTY FIVE'S ALMOST A THIRD OF NEW COMPANIES ARE SET UP BY PEOPLE IN THIS AGE GROUP WITH ANOTHER SEVEN PER CENT SET UP BY PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE LIKE STEVENSON IS THE OWNER OF COMMUNICATIONS AND MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKING COMPANY THINK TASTIC
BUT SHE SET UP WHEN HE WAS SIX YEAR IN A SALFORD STUDIO MIGHT GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SO TELL US WHY YOU SET UP YOUR OWN COMPANY AT A TIME OF LIFE ARE MOST PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT WINDING DOWN
WELL I DIDN'T THINK OF IT LIKE THAT AT ALL AND I AND I AND I REALLY
I GET PUZZLED BECAUSE I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF AS THE AGE I AM AND YOU WILL I'VE GONE AT ALL THIS EXPERIENCE I HAVE A PASSION AND I HAVE A PURPOSE SO I HAVE NO INTENTION OF RETIRING AND A FUEL MORE ENERGISED BY WHAT I'M DOING NO THAT I HAVE ANY TIME OR WORKING LIFE SO IT WAS NEVER REALLY AN OPTION FOR ME TO TO RETIRE
SO HOW DID YOU GET TO THIS POINT WHY DECIDE TO SET UP THE COMPANY WELL I I SEE
I MEAN WHAT THING TASTIC DOES AS WE TRY AND RE ENERGISE ORGANISATIONS AND COMPANIES AND PUT SOME OF THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPARK INTO STAR FOR ALL LEVELS SO YOU KNOW I'VE HAD A PRETTY VARIED EXPERIENCE A VERY VARIED EXPERIENCE SO I WANTED TO INSPIRE AND GIVE HOPE TO
PEOPLE WHO LIKE ME MAKE A FIST DISADVANTAGES AND A LIFE AND FACE ADVERSITY AND ALSO WHEN YOU WANT TO WHAT POLICE AS YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRESSED OUT WE DON'T FEEL CONNECTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE ORGANISATION ARE WORKING FOR US
I HAVE GOT THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO EMPOWER PEOPLE ON TO INSPIRE THEM SO WHY LEAVE THAT AT ALL BEFORE I CAN GROW TO THE BOAT AND AND MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THOSE TOOLS BECAUSE IF YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE LIVED ON THE STREETS FOR A LITTLE BIT YOU DESCRIBED YOURSELF AS AN ACADEMIC FAILURE BUT DO YOU THINK ALL OF THAT CONTRIBUTES TO WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN OFFER MASSIVELY
I MEAN YOU KNOW THAT THE ACADEMIC FEEL YOU SAY I WASN'T THE SUCCESS AT SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW WE WE PROVIDE LEARNING AND AND I I THINK YOU KNOW I'VE LEARNT A HUGE AMOUNT FROM DISENGAGEMENT AT SCHOOL TO HOE TO ENGAGE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DISTRACTED
AND INFORMATION IS COULD BE A BLEAK LANDSCAPE AND WANT TO TURN IT INTO SOMETHING THAT'S COLOURFUL AND SOMETHING THAT'S ATTRACTIVE AND SOMETHING THAT'S COMPELLING
SO WHEN I DO TRAINING FOR EXAMPLE AND BE ABLE TO BRING ALL OF THAT EXPERIENCE THE BEER I'VE GOT STORIES TO BACK IT UP AND IT'S DOES AN AUTHENTICITY ABOUT THAT AND THERE'S A PERSUASIVENESS ABOUT THAT SO YES ALL MY EXPERIENCE IS AS USEFUL IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE AND PERSUADING PEOPLE THAT
THE ALLIES COULD BE IMPROVED AND YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT A LONER IN DOING THIS SO WHAT ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING THAT SOMETHING THERE LOTS OF ENTREPRENEURS HAVE STRUGGLED WITH IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WHEN YOU GO TO A BANK AND ASK FOR A LOAN TO THE SEA AS A SAFE PAIR OF HANDS OR PERHAPS A LIABILITY
I DON'T KNOW COS I'VE BEEN TO A BANK BUT WHAT I DO KNOW AS YOU ARE FEW YOUR SQUAD A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY WERE TOLD HIM OVER A MILLION POUNDS A YEAR AND THE BANK WAS IT WAS ALWAYS THERE ALWAYS ON MY DOORSTEP WHEN THE COMPANY BEGAN TO TO LOSE MONEY THE BANK HAD DISAPPEARED AND IT IS DIFFICULT AT THE AGE OF A NORMAL SIXTY SIX TO GO AND ASK FOR A LOAN I I HAVEN'T TRIED IT
BUT I WOULD IMAGINE IT WOULD CARRY OFF YOU WEE BIT OF A CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE PAYBACK PERIOD MIGHT BE A CRECHE AND
AND JUST FINALLY MIKE IF SOMEONE WAS LISTENING THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS WHAT WHAT TIP WOULD YOU GIVE THEM WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE WELL I THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S THREE MAIN THINGS ONE HAS YOUR BUSINESS NO
A SEISMIC CHANGE IN BUSINESS CULTURE AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE APPRENTICE IS NOT ABOUT THE KIND OF NARCISSISM AND AT THE KIND OF BULLYING CULTURE THAT WE SEE BUSINESS REPRESENTED US ALL THE TIME BUSINESS IS ABOUT PASSION
IT'S ABOUT PURPOSE AND IT'S ABOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU KNOW TRADITIONAL BUSINESS MODELS ARE GONE AND WE NEED TO TO LOOK AT DOING SOMETHING COMPLETELY FRESH AND COMPLETELY NEW SO TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS

SCIENTISTS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE USING A CONTROVERSIAL TECHNIQUE TO CREATE HUMAN ORGANS BY GROWING THEM INSIDE PIGS SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE ANIMALS COULD PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO THE SHORTAGE OF HUMAN ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT BUT THE RESEARCH RAISES ETHICAL CONCERNS SUCH AS THE AFFECT HUMAN CELLS MIGHT HAVE ON THE DEVELOPING PIG
A LANDMARK STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT TAKING HORMONAL DRUGS FOR UP TO TEN YEARS RATHER THAN THE STANDARD FIVE CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF BREAST CANCERS RETURNING BY A THIRD THE TRIAL WAS CARRIED OUT ON NEARLY TWO THOUSAND WOMEN WHO DOUBLED THE LENGTH OF TIME THEY USE DRUGS TO STOP THE BODY MAKING OESTROGEN THE RESEARCHERS SAID IT INCREASE THE RISK OF OSTEOPOROSIS

A LEADING LOYALIST IN NORTHERN IRELAND HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDERING TWO CATHOLIC WORKMEN IN BELFAST IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND NINETEEN NINETY ONE WINSTON RAY WHO'S SIXTY FIVE IT'S DUE TO APPEAR AT BELFAST MAGISTRATES' COURT THIS MORNING HE WAS ARRESTED AFTER POLICE GAINED ACCESS TO INTERVIEWS HE'D RECORDED FOR AN AMERICAN ORAL HISTORY PROJECT
THE BODY OF MUHAMMAD ALI HAS ARRIVED IN HIS HOME TOWN OF LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY WHERE HIS FUNERAL WILL TAKE PLACE LATER THIS WEEK HIS COFFIN WAS DRIVEN FROM THE AIRPORT IN A MOTORCADE CURRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU NEED TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN
IN THE TOPSY TURVY REFERENDUM WORLD WE NOW LIVE IN LEADING TORIES WILL ACCUSE THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT HAVE WANTED TO LAND THE COUNTRY WITH A TWO BILLION POUND BILL FROM BRUSSELS AND THE TORY LEADER WILL ACCUSE HIS OWN COLLEAGUES ARE PERPETUATING A GIANT ECONOMIC COM WHAT STANDING ALONGSIDE THE LEADERS OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS THE GREENS IN THE FORMER LABOUR LEADER HARRIET HARMAN THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL IS NORMAN SMITH HE'S OUR SYSTEM POLITICAL I DON'T WISH CARROT BIG NORMAN IT'S PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY STUFF THIS ISN'T IT IT'S
ALMOST DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN SUCH IS THE LEVEL OF INVECTIVE BETWEEN THE TWO RIVAL TORY CAMPS TODAY WITH EACH DAY THE BITTERNESS AND ACRIMONY SEEM TO GO UP ANOTHER NOTCH AND I SUSPECT IT WILL GO UP ANOTHER NOTCH TODAY WITH THESE LATEST CLAIMS FROM THE BRICKS AT CAMP THAT BRITAIN WILL BE HIT WITH FURTHER BILLIONS OF POUNDS' WORTH OF BILLS TO BRUSSELS BECAUSE THEY CLAIM
THAT WE WILL BE ON THE HOOK FOR FUTURE Y. YOU BAIL OUT TOO STRICKEN COUNTRIES LIKE GREECE AND ALSO WE WILL BE PAYING IN MORE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO THE E.U. BUDGET NOW I CAN TELL YOU ALREADY THIS MORNING I'VE HAD REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS ON THE PHONE AND DESCRIBING THESE CLAIMS AS LIES UNTRUTHS AND FALSEHOODS
FACTUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CLAIMS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT QUESTION MARKS AND DOUBTS ABOUT THEM IN TERMS OF THE FIRST CLAIMED THE EURO BAILOUT THE LEE SIDE SAY THAT WE CONTRIBUTED TO GREECE THROUGH SOMETHING CALLED A EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY MECHANISM AND WE WILL BE IN LINE IN FUTURE FOR FURTHER BAYLOR
AGAINST THAT FACTUALLY WE HAVE A VETO THE PRIME MINISTER SECURED A VETO IN FEBRUARY AGAINST ANY FURTHER U.K. COMMITMENTS TO ANY BAIL OUTS FOR EUROZONE COUNTRIES IT'S ALSO POINTED OUT THE EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY MECHANISMS ACTUALLY FOR ALL E.U. COUNTRIES NOT SPECIFICALLY FOR THE EUROZONE AND ON THE BUDGET FUTURE BUDGET INCREASES AGAIN FACTUALLY WE HAVE A VETO ON LONG TERM INCREASES IN THE BUDGET AND ACTUALLY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS SAID OF THE NEXT
A FEW YEARS THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN THE BUDGET SO I SUSPECT WE ARE AGAIN GOING TO SEE CLAIMS THAT THESE ARGUMENTS ARE UNTRUE AND DECEITFUL AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE BRAKES AT CAMP ARE INCENSED BY WHAT THEY REGARD AS THEIR DESPERATE TACTICS OF MY CAMERON APPEARING WITH OPPOSITION FIGURES LIKE HARRIET HARMAN NATALIE BENNETT AND MICHAEL TIM FARRON TO ATTACK FELLOW TORE IT SO IT IS DAY BY DAY BECOMING EVER MORE BITTER
ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS IS IS THIS ISN'T IT NORMAN THERE FOR THIS REFERENDUM WHEN YOU STUDIED THE OPINION POLLS YOU DISCOVER THAT THE E. U. WAS REMARKABLY LOW ON THEIR LIST OF PUBLIC CONCERNS FROM MY MEMORY I THINK HE WAS EIGHTH AT THE HIGHER SOMETIMES TENTH SOMETIMES EVEN LOWER ISN'T WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AND ATTEMPT TO TAG ONTO AN ISSUE THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER CARED THAT MUCH ABOUT A WHOLE SERIES OF THINGS ABOUT WHICH THEY ARE PASSIONATE IN THE HOPE OF GRABBING THEIR ATTENTION
I THINK I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF TRUTH IN THAT NICK AND I THINK IT WAS INTERESTING YESTERDAY IN JOHN MAJOR'S SIR JOHN MAJOR'S ONSLAUGHT YES OF COURSE THE BULK OF IT WAS ABOUT THE E.U. BUT HE'D ALSO INCLUDED QUESTION MARKS ABOUT THE N.H.S. THE APPROACH OF FIGURES LIKE BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO TO THE N.H.S. THERE GENERAL TRUSTWORTHINESS AND CREDIBILITY WHETHER THEY WERE ANY LONGER IN TUNE WITH ONE NATION CONSERVATISM IT NOW GOES MUCH MUCH BROADER THAN THAT I THINK ALSO
IT IS BECAUSE THE POLES HAVE BECOME SO CLOSE THAT THIS HAS BECOME SUCH AN EDGY TESTY AFFAIR I THINK TOO THAT THE RIVAL SIDES HAVE BECOME USED TO CRITICISING EACH OTHER AND THEREFORE THEY HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH EVER INFLATING THE RHETORIC THEY USE AGAINST EACH OTHER NO WELL LASTLY TO STATE THE OBVIOUS IT IS A POLITICAL FIGHT TO THE DEATH WHERE THERE IS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR COMPROMISE IT AS THEY FIGHT TO THE FINISH
NORMAN SMITH WILL BE THERE THROUGHOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN SCIENTISTS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE TRYING TO GROW HUMAN ORGANS INSIDE PIGS THEY HOPE ON MIGHT ONE DAY LEAD TO A SOLUTION TO THE SHORTAGE OF ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT FERGUS WASH THAT HEALTH CORRESPONDENT IS PRESENTING A PANORAMA TONIGHT CALL MEDICINES BIG BREAKTHROUGH EDITING YOUR JEANS AND HE'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU WHAT
FIRST OF ALL JUST IN PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT IS IT THAT THE RESEARCHERS YOU'VE TALKED TO HER IT O.K. SO THEY'D THEY TAKE PIG EMBRYOS AND THEY DO WHAT'S KNOWN AS GENE EDITING THEY ROOT REMOVED THE D.N.A. INSTRUCTIONS IN THAT PIG EMBRYO TO MAKE IT
INCAPABLE OF GROWING ITS OWN PANCREAS THEN THEY INJECT HUMAN STEM CELLS AND THE HOPE IS THAT THESE WILL FILL THE GENETIC VOID THE NICHE THERE AND IT WILL GROW A HUMAN PANCREAS INSTEAD AND
THESE EMBRYOS PART HUMAN PART PIG AND ENDLESS CHIMERAS AND THEY'RE IMPLANTED IN SOUSE AND THE SAME TECHNIQUE COULD BE USED WITH HEARTS LUNGS LIVERS KIDNEYS AND IF THAT THE CELLS WERE TAKEN FROM PATIENTS
WAITING ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST THEN THE RESULTING ORGANS A FEW MONTHS LATER COULD BE TISSUE MATCHED TO THOSE PATIENTS HAVE TWO TEAM IN CALIFORNIA AND MINNESOTA THAT THAT WE FILM WITH ONE OF THEM SCOTT FOUND CREEK FROM RECOMBINATION TICKS IN MINNESOTA SEES A FUTURE WHERE ORGAN FARMS COULD SOLVE THE TRANSPLANT SHORTAGE
IT'S A NEAR GLOBALLY BUT IN THE U.S. ALONE ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE DIE ON THE WAITING LIST EACH DAY WAITING FOR AN ORGAN SO THIS PROVIDES AND UNLIMITED DOMAIN
YOU WOULD TELL THE PATIENT CLEAR THERE COME BACK IN FOUR MONTHS
CLARY WOULD BE PRODUCED IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AND WITH A GENETICS IDENTICAL TO THE PATIENT SO GOES PATIENCE WILL HAVE NOT ONLY THE RESTORED FUNCTION OF THE THERAPEUTIC TISSUES AND ORGANS THEY RECEIVE BUT THEY WON'T HAVE TO BE IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS THAT THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DRESSED PLANTATIONS HAVE TO DEAL WITH
RIGHT THAT'S THE UPSIDE SOUND LIKE A BIG UPSIDE TO THE DOWNSIDE THOUGH WELL REMEMBER YOUR GREEK MYTHOLOGY JUSTIN CHIMERAS WERE MONSTERS FIRE BREATHING MONSTERS WHO WERE PART LION PART GOAT PART SNAKE
SO IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE TERM CHIMERA FIT FOR THESE FOR THESE EMBRYOS THE MAIN U.S. RESEARCH AGENCY THE N.I.H. HAS REFUSED TO FUND THESE EXPERIMENTS COS THEY'RE WORRIED WHERE WILL THESE HUMAN CELLS END UP THEY MIGHT GO TO THE BRAIN THEY MIGHT INCREASE INTELLIGENCE OR MAKE THE PIGS MORE HUMAN REALLY THAT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT'S THE FEAR AND THAT WE FILMED THESE OWLS CARRYING THESE EMBRYOS AND
SUCH IS THE SENSITIVITY THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING ALLOWED TO BE BORN EVEN THE FRICK EXPERIMENTATION BUT THEY'RE BEING ALLOWED TO GO TO A FEW WEEKS' GESTATION BECAUSE
OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT WHERE THE TISSUE WILL MIGRATE TO AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'LL BE CHECKING THAT THIS IS VERY VERY NEW WORK AND COMPASSION IN WORLD FARMING SAID WELL THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WAY TO EXPLOIT OUR ANIMALS BUT THE REAL ADVANCE HERE IS ZINA TRANSPLANTATION IS IT CALLED USING PIG ORGANS FOR HUMANS HAS NOW IS NOW BACK ON THE AGENDA AFTER BEING IN THE DOLDRUMS FOR LIKE TWENTY YEARS BECAUSE OF FEARS ABOUT PIG VIRUSES INFECTING HUMANS BUT GENE EDITING THESE NEW
TECHNIQUES TO MANIPULATE D.N.A. MEAN THAT ANIMAL ORGANS CAN BE MADE MUCH MORE HUMAN LIKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH SIR JOHN BYRNE PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL GENETICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME PANORAMA WITH FERGUS IS TONIGHT AT EIGHT THIRTY B. B. C. ONE
TIME NOW IT'S TWENTY TO SEVEN IT'S TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS DAVID CAMERON AND HIS PREDECESSOR SIR JOHN MAJOR SHARE THE HEADLINES IN THE PAPERS COVERAGE OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN SEVERAL OF THEM REPORT DAVID CAMERON'S PLAN THEIR PARENTS TODAY ALONGSIDE THE SENIOR LABOUR M.P. FORMER LABOUR LEADER HARRIET HARMAN AND THE LEADERS OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS AND GREEN PARTY THE TELEGRAPH WHICH LEADS ON THE STORY SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER WILL INTENSIFY THE TORY CIVIL WAR
BY JOINING HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS TO ATTACK BRECK'S IT MEMBERS OF HIS OWN CABINET SO JOHN MAJOR'S ASSAULT ON CONSERVATIVE PR EXETER'S ON THE ANDREW MARR SHOW IS ALSO A VERY WIDELY REPORTED THE SUN YOU DITCHED HIS DECADES OLD GREY MAN IMAGE TO LAUNCH THE EXTRAORDINARY ATTACK THE MALE PRACTICES THAT STORY WITH THE HEADLINE RATTLED MAJOR LOSES THE PLOT
THE GUARDIAN LEADS WITH A JOINT APPEAL BY TEN UNION LEADERS FOR THEIR MEMBERS TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE E.U. IN A LETTER TO THE PAPER THEY SAY THAT IF BRITAIN WERE TO LEAVE THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WOULD DISMANTLE HARD WON RIGHTS FOR WORKERS ON PARENTING HOLIDAYS AND EQUALITY FOR ITS MEANT STORY THE TIMES SAYS IT'S BEEN TOLD BY MILITARY COMMANDERS THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES ARE ON THE FRONT IN SYRIA
DEFENDING REBEL UNIT LEADER WHO'S A REBEL UNIT I SHOULD SAY WHO'S UNDER WHICH IS UNDER DAILY ATTACK FROM THE ISLAMIC STATE RUPERT SAYS THE OPERATION MARKS THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF THE TROOPS DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN SYRIA RATHER THAN JUST TRAINING REBELS AND JORDAN BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES BASED IN JORDAN FREQUENTLY CROSS INTO SYRIA TO ASSIST THE NEW SYRIAN ARMY REBELS THE PAPER SET ELSEWHERE IN THE TIMES THE PAPER REPORTS THAT ZIMBABWE'S AGAIN FACING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE WITH ALMOST NO MONEY IN THE BANKS
THE PAPER SAYS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE QUEUE AT CASH MACHINES IN HARARE OFTEN IN VAIN WHEN BANKS HAVE CASH TO DISPENSE IT CAN TAKE TWO HOURS TO REACH THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE BUT A CASH WITHDRAWAL CAP HAS BEEN CUT FROM TWO THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO TO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS ACCORDING TO THE PAPER IT'S WIDELY BELIEVE THE BANKS HAVE HAD TO CURB WITHDRAWALS BECAUSE PRESIDENT MUGABE'S GOVERNMENT IS ILLEGALLY DEMANDING LOANS THE FORCE THEM TO RAID CUSTOMERS C.V.S I'M AT ALI'S STEPH
CONTINUES TO ATTRACT EXTENSIVE COVERAGE ON THE FRONT PAGE AS WELL AS THE INSIDE PAGES IT'S THE LEAD FOR THE EITHER MIRROR THE SUN THE STARS OR MANY OF THEM HAVE PULL OUT SUPPLEMENTS REFLECTING ON HIS LIFE AND HIS CAREER IN THE MAIL AND ITS TRIBUTE SAYS HE WAS SO MUCH MORE THAN THE KING OF SPORT AND THE GUARDIAN HE WAS ALSO A FIGHTER A JOKER OR ME MAGICIAN A DISCIPLE AND A PREACHER THE MAIL AND THE SUN OF THE LAST OFFICIAL PICTURES OF ALI TAKEN TWO MONTHS AGO IN ONE HE RAISES HIS FACE AND THE MAIL SAYS THE HINT OF A SMILE IS VISIBLE
AS WELL AS THE UNDAUNTED SPIRIT OF THE FIGHTER THE BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHY TOOK THE PICTURES XENON TEXT TELLS THE PAPER AND HE WAS SO FRAIL HE HAD TO BE HELPED INTO A CHAIR I COULD FEEL HIS AURA AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM I KNEW I WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF GREATNESS
SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO A SEVEN AND THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNS HAS BRITAIN COULD FACE A BILL RUNNING INTO BILLIONS OF POUNDS OF IT STAYS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE OF THE E. USE RISING COSTS AND IT'LL BE ACCUSED OF PERPETUATING AN ECONOMIC CON TRICK THIS MORNING WHEN DAVID CAMERON SHARES A PLATFORM WITH SENIOR FIGURES FROM OTHER PARTIES
THE FIRST BRITISH TROOPS OF UP TO FOUR HUNDRED EXPECTED TO TAKE ON A PEACE KEEPING ROLE IN SOUTH SUDAN HAVE ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO THE WORLD'S YOUNGEST STATE ERUPTED INTO CIVIL WAR PROBABLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED MILLIONS REMAIN DISPLACED AND HUNGRY AFTER A SEARING DROUGHT BUT THE END OF APRIL THE TWO RIVAL POLITICAL LEADERS FINALLY SAT DOWN TOGETHER IN THE CAPITAL JUBA TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING A PEACE DEAL
HOW'S IT GOING OR AFRICA CORRESPONDENT ALISTAIR LEAF IT WENT FOR A NIGHT OUT IN JUBA WHERE LIFE IS STARTING TO GET BACK TO SOME KIND OF NORMALITY
IT'S COMEDY NIGHT IS DUE BEST WHEN THE AUDIENCE IS LAPPING IT UP
MOST OF IT'S IN WHAT'S KNOWN AS DUBA ARABIC LOCAL POTS WHILE THAT'S HARD TO FOLLOW EVEN FOR FLUENT ARABIC SPEAKERS
THE JOKES PLAY ON STEREO TYPES LIKE LIE BARACK OBAMA CAN'T BE SUCH A POWERFUL MAN AND HE'S NOT FAT AND A PLAY ON WORDS BETWEEN GUNS AND FUEL PUMPS THEY AT LEAST KNOW THEIR AUDIENCE BUT A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF CIVIL WAR THE DEAD THE ATROCITIES ON BOTH SIDES THE MILLIONS STILL DISPLACED
MY NAME IS MOST UNLOVABLE MADE AND WE SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO SOCIETY AND WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE ARE TRAUMATISED YOU NEED A BRAIN WE NEED TO REDUCE THIS TRAUMA WITHIN THIS SOCIETY AND COMEDIAN OR KILLED AND THE JOKES WE DO ACTUALLY I DOGS THAT CAN UNITE PEOPLE IN SALSA THAT MAKE THEM TALKING ABOUT THEIR POLITICAL PROBLEMS
YOU CAN MAKE UP OWNERS
THE GUY RUNNING THE COMEDY NIGHT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST POP STARS MY MEN WITH INTO THE ALARM IF THIS WAS MY MUSIC AND I'M A MILE FROM EALING IN MY AGE LEFT LOU MARIE SORRY MUM
OH STELLA
I'M JUST SAYING BE SO SCARRED BY LAST DO YOU BELIEVE IT HAS PIECE ACTUALLY COME YEAH I DO BELIEVE THIS ALREADY PEACE AT LAST WE'VE GOT IN OUR BROTHER BUCK DUMMY HAD MY GERRY'S YEAR REGULAR THEY GREETED EACH OTHER AND IT WAS AN EXCITEMENT TO ME
WE'RE DRIVING AROUND IN THE CAPITAL HERE BEAR IT'S PRETTY DARK AS THEY STREET LIGHTS IT'S ALMOST QUARTER TO ELEVEN AT NIGHT AND DOING THIS A FEW MONTHS AGO IS VERY MUCH AN THINKABLE
IT'S MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE NOW WALKING OR DRIVING LATE AT NIGHT THERE AREN'T THE ROAD BLOCKS ARE PUT UP THERE AREN'T THE POLICE DEMANDING SEARCHES FOR WEAPONS IT JUST FEELS MORE RELAXED AND IT DID
VEGAS IS JUST ONE OF THE NIGHTCLUBS IT DONE EVERYBODY OF THE LIVES THEY CLUMP UP AND IT JUST DO THAT THEN I'M GOING TO DO THAT IS MARK
DOESN'T IT THAT IT'S DOES BIT OF FRIDAY AND SATURDAY OF THE REALLY BIG KNIGHTS AND AS ASSISTANT MANAGER FEISAL MOSER EXPLAINED IT'S HELPING MEND THE ETHNIC DIVIDE WHICH THE POLITICAL CRISIS HAS WIDENED YOU NOT ENTERTAIN MEN BUT OF BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER
WHEN PEOPLE FROM THE OPPOSITION I MEAN THAT IN THE WAY OF A COMMUNITY
THE INCA COME SO WHEN THEY COME TO BE A CLUB HE TRIED TO GET UP
THE DRUM I THINK THAT'S HAPPY SO HE PUT A TRAIN TO MORE FUCKIN COUNTRY
THE GIRLS ON THE RIGHT THE ECONOMY'S BEEN GOOD ESPECIALLY HOWARD YEAH LOOKING EVENT FOR MY NEW NOT MY NEW LOOKING FOR WHAT NO ONE NURSING NOW HE HAS A VERY NICE HOUSE AND A BULL MIKE DO YOU THINK GOOD PIECE IS GOING TO HOLD YEAH IT'S FINE
VERY SURE THAT FILING YOU I AM SMILING
OPTIMISTIC N.C. LUBE EXES SO CONVINCED HE'S GREAT AS YOU SAW WHY WHY WE ARE NOW ONE AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE HE'S AN ACTION IF YOU BELIEVE THIS PIECE DIDN'T RUTH BEAUTIFUL BUZZ
ALISTAIR LAID THEM OUT FOR THE NIGHT IN SWINGING TUBA IT IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. MIGHT WE STILL FIND OURSELVES ACTUALLY INNIT FOR FLORAL MORE YEARS AND IN THE E.U. SINGLE MARKET FOR MUCH MUCH LONGER THAN THAT AND I MIGHT SEEM A PUZZLING QUESTION
BUT IT WAS RAISED BY THE LEADING LEAVE CAMPAIGNER MICHAEL GAVE HIMSELF DECLARED ON TELEVISION YESTERDAY THAT THE U.K. WOULD STILL BE IN THE Y. U. IN TWENTY TWENTY EVEN IF PEOPLE DID VOTE AS HE WANTS THEM TO RAISE TO BUY AN INTRIGUING STORY DUG OUT BY HER OWN JAMES LANDALE NOW THE B.B.C.'S DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JOINS ON THE MORNING TO YOU JAMES WHAT ARE YOU HEARING
WELL AS THE PULSE TITAN AND BELIEVE CAMPAIGN MAKE A LOT OF THE RUNNING IN THIS REFERENDUM A LOT OF PROOF REMAIN M.P.S HAVE SPOKEN TO ME AND SAID THAT THEY ARE NOW BEGINNING TO CONTEMPLATE THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY LOSE IF BRICKS IT WINS PARTICULARLY WHAT ROLE PARLIAMENT MIGHT PLAY BECAUSE THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT PARLIAMENT IS OBVIOUSLY OVERWHELMINGLY PRO REMAIN BY MY TALLY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR M.P.S FOR REMAIN ONLY ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN FOR LEAVE THE GUMS AND HE GOT A WORKING MAJORITY OF SEVENTEEN SO THEY
THESE PRO YOU E. U. M. P. TO THINKING HOW DO THEY USE THAT MAJORITY
PARTICULARLY IF BRICKS IT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE GOVERNMENT WERE TO GO FOR SOME CANADA STYLE LIMITED FREE TRADE AGREEMENT THEN THESE M.P.S THINK LOOK THAT MIGHT BE ECONOMICALLY DAMAGING SO COULD THEY USE THEIR VOTING POWER IN PARLIAMENT TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT A BIT LIKE NORWAY EVEN THOUGH IT'S LEAVING THE E.U. TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET ONE OF THOSE M.P.S IS STEPHEN KINNOCK THE PER REMAIN LABOUR M.P. FOR ABERAVON
IF THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. THAT'S ONE THING BUT CAN WE REALLY SAY THAT THEY VOTED FOR THE DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION OF THE ENTIRE EXPORTING SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY I DON'T THINK YOU CAN NECESSARILY SAY THAT THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC MANDATE FOR THAT
PARLIAMENT MAY SAY WELL WE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE NORWAY MODEL BECAUSE AT LEAST THAT WON'T DESTROY THE ENTIRE BRITISH ECONOMY SO IN OTHER WORDS JAMES WHAT THIS STORY MEANS IS THAT IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE OVER ON JUNE THE TWENTY FOURTH IT REALLY WILL NOT BE OVER HOW WILL THAT WORK THEN IN THE FUTURE WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES WELL OTHER TRICK YOUR OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR M.P.S
THERE'S BRICKS SIT THEN THE GOVERNMENT AT SOME POINT LATER THIS YEAR WOULD SEEK A NEGOTIATING MANDATE IN PARLIAMENT BEFORE IT GOES TO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND STARTS TALKING ABOUT WHAT A FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE THAT'LL BE ONE PRESSURE POINT ALSO THEN ONCE THE DEAL'S BEEN DONE AND THE GUM HAS TO PUSH IT THROUGH PARLIAMENT A HUGE LEGISLATIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR M.P.S TO HAVE A GO ONE MINISTER DESCRIBED THE PROCESS HE SAID IT WOULD BE A BIT LIKE A REVERSE MAASTRICHT SORT OF ECHO OF THOSE BLOODY TORY BATTLE AS IT OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES BUT THIS TIME
WITH A SORT OF DOUGHTY PRO E.U. BAND OF EM PEAS HARRYING THE GOVERNMENT NOW THE CONSEQUENCE FOR THAT THOUGH IS POTENTIALLY QUITE TRICKY COS ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE IN A REFERENDUM VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U. BUT IN PART BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION AND THEN M. P. SAY NO WE WANT TO STAY IN THE SINGLE MARKET AND OH YES BY THE WAY THAT WOULD MEAN OUR BORDERS STAYING OPEN TO E. U. WORKERS ANNA'S STEPHEN KIM IT WARNS THEY COULD BE A POTENTIAL CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS
THE GOVERNMENT WOULD THEN HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND THAT CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND DRIVEN A LOT OF PEOPLE
TO PUT THEIR CROSS ON THE BALLOT PAPER FOR LEAVE BECAUSE OF CONCERNS AROUND IMMIGRATION WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER ANY CHANGE IN THAT CONTEXT SO IN A SENSE IT'S A LOSE LOSE SITUATION I DON'T SEE HOW YOU UNTIE THAT GORDIAN KNOT BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT A MASSIVE ECONOMIC CRISIS GOING DOWN THE TRACK OF THE CANADA MODEL
AND A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS GOING DOWN THE TRACK OF THE NORWAY MODEL STEPHEN GET OUT THERE TALKING TO JAMES LANDALE INTRIGUING STORY LET'S PURSUE THIS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER NOW WITH REAL RUPA OR HE IS CO DIRECTOR OF THE THINK TANK OPEN EUROPE WHO'VE DECLARE THEMSELVES TO BE NEUTRAL IN THIS E.U. REFERENDUM IF WE COULD RUN TO TAKE PEOPLE THROUGH STEP BY STEP WHY IS IT NOT THE CASE QUITE SIMPLY THAT IF THE COUNTRY VOTES TO LEAVE ON ONE DAY
WE LEAVE THE NEXT WHY DOESN'T THAT HAPPEN WELL THE PROCESS BELIEVING HE WAS THROUGH SOMETHING KNOWN ARTICLE FIFTY IN THE E.U. TREATIES AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO NOTIFY THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL THAT ACTIVATES THAT IT WANTS TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND THEN THIS ARTICLE SPECIFIES THAT THERE'S A TWO YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD TO NEGOTIATE THE COUNTRY LEAVING THE E.U. AND THAT AFTER THOSE TWO YEARS THE U.K. WOULD CEASE BEING A PART OF THE E.U. AND ALL THE LAWS AND RULES TIED UP WITH THE E.U. WOULD CEASE NOW THIS PERIOD COULD BE EXTENDED
ALL THE COUNTRIES AGREE BUT ONCE THE DEAL IS REACHED IT HAS TO BE APPROVED BY A QUALIFIED MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRIES AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND IT'S IT'S IN A SENSE A TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT DEAL GIVE INTO THE U.K. NOW YOU DON'T SPEAK FOR MICHAEL GO LET'S TAKE A GUESS AS TO WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN HIS MIND WHEN HE SAID ON TELEVISION WE MIGHT STILL BE THERE IN TWENTY TWENTY HASTILY AFTERWARDS AS WE DIDN'T MEAN THAT REALLY BUT HE CLEARLY SAID IT AND IT WAS IN HIS MIND WHY THAT MIGHT THAT BE
I AGREE THIS WILL TAKE A NUMBER OF YEARS TO SORT OUT IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS YOU COULD GET TO THAT SCENARIO EITHER THE U.K. DOESN'T TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE TWO YEARS DOESN'T KICK IN FOR SOME TIME WHICH WOULD SEEM QUITE STRANGE TO NOT TRIGGER IT GIVEN A VOTE TO LEAVE ANOTHER SCENARIO WOULD BE THAT THE REST OF THE E.U. COUNTRIES HAD AGREED TO EXTEND THE PERIOD BUT MICHAEL GO CAN'T NO THAT ONE REASON THEY MIGHT BE TEMPTED IS THE FIRST UKIP ISN'T IT IT'S OFTEN BEEN SAID BY THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET OUT
THERE'S NO NEED TO RUSH THIS THE Y. YOU WILL HAVE TO RE THINK BECAUSE THEY'VE ASSUMED THE U.K. WILL STAY IN THEY MIGHT THINK AGAIN IF YOU REMEMBER BORIS JOHNSON WAS EVEN FLIRTING WITH THE IDEA OF A SECOND REFERENDUM AT ONE STAGE SO IF A PRIME MINISTER WANTED TO SAY LET'S NOT RUSH THIS LET'S GIVE EVERYONE TIME TO JUST TAKE STOCK IN THEORY THEY COULD COULDN'T THEY YES IN THEORY THEY COULD THE REFERENDUM IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING IT DOESN'T FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO DO ANYTHING IT'S A POLITICAL POWER
THEY COULD TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS THEY WANT TO PUT OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE PUBLIC PRESSURE WOULD MELT AND THERE'S NO EMPHASIS ON THE OTHER SIDE TO START NEGOTIATING UNTIL THE TRIGGER THE PROCESS OF LEAVING AT LAST QUESTION REAL IN A SENSE ISN'T THIS YET MORE EVIDENCE THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY QUESTION ONE ARSE IN THIS REFERENDUM DOESN'T HAVE A FACTUAL ANSWER YOU'VE GIVEN US A LOT OF FACTS BUT IN THE END YOU MAKE IT JUST ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN YES EXACTLY I MEAN GIVEN THIS IS SUCH AN UNPRECEDENTED EVENTS NO COUNTRIES LEFT THE E.U. BEFORE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT WILL
KEEPS US IN BUSINESS IS ABOUT HIS REAL ROOT OF OPEN EUROPE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN THE TALIBAN IN AFGHANISTAN ARE MAKING A MINT IN MINING MONEY THAT IS THEN USED TO FUEL THEIR ATTACK ON THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT STEVEN CARTER IS THE AFGHANISTAN CAMPAIGN LEADER THE ANTI CORRUPTION GROUP GLOBAL WITNESS AND HE'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE THEY DOING
WELL IN BARRACKS SONG AS OUR TWO YEARS OF RESEARCH HAVE SHOWN THAT IS AN ENORMOUS TREASURY FOR THE AFRICAN
THERE'S A RESOURCE WHICH SHOULD BE GENERATING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REVENUE WHICH SHOULD BE HELPING TO DRIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH INSTEAD IT'S A SORT OF CORRUPTION AND CONFLICT IT'S HELPING TO FUND ARMED GROUPS AND IS ACTUALLY DRIVING THE LOCAL PEOPLE INTO THE HANDS OF THE TALIBAN SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY RUNNING THE MAINZ IN THESE GREAT NOTES ARE ACTUALLY THE MINES IN THE HANDS OF AN ARMED GROUP
WHICH ACTUALLY WAS FORMALLY THE COMMANDER WAS FORMALLY A CHIEF OF POLICE SO WHAT WE HAVE IS AN ODD SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE ON GROUPS IT SHOULD IN THEORY BE PRO GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY MAKING DEALS OF THE TALIBAN AND PROVIDE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE MINES THEMSELVES AND WHAT IS IT THAT THEY'RE MINE AYE AND MANAGING TO SELL
THIS IS LAPIS LAZULI IT'S AN ANCIENT MINE HERE SIX AND A HALF THOUSAND YEARS OLD AND I SEE EXISTS NOT JUST RARE METALS AND OTHER BECAUSE THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF MINING DEPOSITS AREN'T THERE POTENTIALLY VERY LUCRATIVE ONCE AND YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THAT THIS IS THIS IS AN ISSUE WHICH WE SEE ACROSS ALL OF AFGHANISTAN THERE HE IS
LIKE MORE THAN A THOUSAND LEGAL MINDS AFGHANISTAN THE REVENUE THAT'S GOING TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT FROM ALL THOSE MINES IS WASN'T TWENTY THIRTEEN WAS ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO THE REVENUE THAT'S GONE TO THE ARMED GROUPS FROM JUSTICE ONE SINGLE MINING AREA SO OUR RESEARCH SHOWED THAT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN GIRLS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO LEGAL ON GROUPS AND THE TAIPAN FROM A SINGLE MINE NOW THE TALIBAN AND IN THAT AREA HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY NOT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE CONTRIBUTION FROM THIS MIGHT
ACTUALLY THEY'RE GETTING MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE REVENUE FROM IT I THOUGHT HE WAS LIKE THAT ALL GOES MAINLY TO CHINA BUT ACTUALLY TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND WE HAVE TO REALLY ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO THE LAPIS LAZULI IS IN EFFECT A CONFIT MINERAL BECAUSE
MORE THAN HALF OF THE OF THE REVENUE IT'S BEEN PAID BY THE MINERS TO ACCESS THE MINE IS GOING STRAIGHT TO THE TALIBAN THE REST IS GOING TO AN ILLEGAL ON GROUP AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT
SOMETHING WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE A TREASURE FOR THE AFGHAN PEOPLE WHICH SHOULD BE HELPING THEM IS INSTEAD A POISON AND IT'S NOT BEEN ENOUGH OF A PRIORITY FOR EITHER THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT ALL THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DO MORE QUICKLY WELL IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOING MORE IT'S WHAT DO THINGS BETTER SO THE AMERICANS FOR EXAMPLE SPENT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON MINING AFGHANISTAN
THE RESULT OF THAT IS A MINISTRY OF MINES WHICH IS NOT ABLE IT SEEMED TO PRODUCE A SINGLE DOCUMENT WHICH SAYS HERE THE CONTRACTS WE HAVE HERE'S THE REVENUE THAT'S BEING PRODUCED AND HERE IT IS THE BENEFITS THE AFGHAN PEOPLE SO
THAT IT NEEDS TO BE SMOOTH NOT AS AN ISSUE OF MORALITY NOT WASN'T ISSUE OF YOU ECONOMICS BUT I WAS A SECURITY ISSUE FOR BOTH THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'VE SEEN THERE ARE SO MANY MEASURES THAT COULD BE PUT IN PLACE BASIC PROTECTIONS WERE TRANSPARENT TRANSPARENCY AND SECURITY
PUBLISHING CONTRACTS PUBLISHING THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS THUMB PUBLISHING THE DATA ON THE MINING MAKING A HALF PROD FOR SECURITY AND GIVING LOCAL PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO GET A BENEFIT FOR MARK THESE MINES AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT STEVEN CARTER FROM GLOBAL IN US THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN BEN WHICH IS HERE WITH HER BROTHER NICK THANK YOU GOOD MORNING YESTERDAY WE GOT CLOSE TO TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH WEST WALES AND THERE'S PLENTY MORE OF THAT WARMTH AND SUNSHINE TO COME THROUGH THE NEXT FEW DAYS ALBEIT WITH A RISK OF SOME SHOWERS PARTICULARLY IN WESTERN AREAS
TODAY ACROSS SOUTH WEST ENGLAND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND MOSTLY FINE AND DRY DAY SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE JUST THE SMALL CHANCE OF A SHOWER BUT THE VAST MAJORITY WILL STAY DRY FOR WALES FOR NORTHWEST ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND SOUTHWEST SCOTLAND HERE PLENTY OF WARM SUNSHINE IN FACT IN PLACES HERE WE COULD GET TO TWENTY SIX OR TWENTY SEVEN DEGREES HOWEVER IN THESE AREAS THERE CERTAINLY IS THE RISK OF SOME HEAVY POSSIBLY THUNDERY SHOWERS THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON THE SECOND HALF THE AFTERNOON PARTICULARLY
COULD GIVE A LOT OF RAIN IN A SHORT SPACE OF TIME FURTHER EAST TO THE MIDLANDS EASTERN ENGLAND NORTH EAST ENGLAND ALSO EASTERN AND NORTHERN SCOTLAND HERE GOOD DEAL OF SUNSHINE AS WELL CLOSE TO NORTH SEA COASTS YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE PLAGUED BY CLOUD SO TEMPERATURES HERE MAYBE JUST SEVENTEEN DEGREES BUT COME INLAND INTO SOME SUNSHINE TWENTY FIVE TWO AS I MENTIONED PERHAPS TWENTY SEVEN DEGREES
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEN LATER TODAY RADIO FOUR BEGINS A TRUE STORY ABOUT HOW DEATH SAVED HER LIFE
THIS IS THE STORY OF A BOY WHO DIES TO SO HE LOOKED AT ME BUT HE SORT OF LOOK
RIGHT THROUGH ME AND YET SOMEHOW OUT OF THAT GREAT SADNESS
HUMS HOPE IF SHE'S BEEN TOLD AT LEAST IN THE SUN IN THEY'VE GIVEN US THIS GIFT A MUM WILL REACH OUT AND PUT HER HAND FLAT ON THE CHEST OF A HEALTHY YOUNG MAN
AND FEEL THE HEART OF HER LOST BOY BEATING AWAY INSIDE HIM
A KIND OF MIRACLE THE TRUE STORY OF THE BOY WHO GAVE HIS HEART AWAY THIS MONDAY TO FRIDAY AT ONE FORTY FIVE ON B. B. C. FOR RADIO FOUR
IN THE NEXT HOUR ON THIS PROGRAMME WE'LL BE TALKING TO MICHAEL MOORE THE AMERICAN FILMMAKER BUT U.S. POLITICS AND OTHER THINGS WILL HEAR AND BE HEARING ABOUT A LEGAL CHALLENGE EVER LONDON'S PROBLEMS WITH AIR POLLUTION AND WILL ALSO BE DISCUSSING ETHICS ARE GROWING HUMAN ORGANS IN PIGS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND JUSTIN WEBB
GOOD MORNING IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE SIXTH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SAY BRITAIN MAY HAVE TO PAY BILLIONS OF POUNDS TO THE Y. U. IF IT REMAINS A MEMBER BUT THEY'RE BEING ACCUSED OF PERPETUATING AN ECONOMIC CON TRICK
SCIENTISTS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE TRYING TO GROW HUMAN PANCREAS IS IN PIGS TO OVERCOME A GLOBAL SHORTAGE OF TRANSPLANT ORGANS AND MAJOR STUDY HAS FOUND THAT WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO AVOID A RECURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER IF THEY TAKE HORMONAL DRUGS FOR UP TO TEN YEARS THE B.B.C. NEWS READ THIS MORNING BY CURRY
LEADING BREAKS IT CAMPAIGNERS HAVE WARNED THAT A BOAT TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. COULD LEAVE BRITAIN WITH THE MULTI BILLION POUND BILL THEY SAY THE U.K. COULD BE MADE TO PAY TOWARDS BUDGET RISES IN BRUSSELS FUTURE EURGH SAME BAIL OUTS AND A BACK HOLE IN THE FINANCES THE REMAIN CAMP HAS DISMISSED THE CLAIMS POINTING OUT THE U.K. HAS A VETO ON BUDGET INCREASES
THE PRIME MINISTER THIS MORNING BRISK FURTHER INFLAMING TENSIONS WITHIN HIS PARTY BY JOINING LEADING OPPOSITION FIGURES TO ATTACK THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THE ACRIMONY BETWEEN THE RIVAL TORY CAMPS IN THIS REFERENDUM SEEMS TO DEEPEN DAY BY DAY TODAY CLAIMS BY THE BRECK AT SIDE THAT BRITAIN WILL BE LIABLE FOR BILLIONS OF POUNDS' WORTH OF EXTRA PAYMENTS TO BRUSSELS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISMISSED AS LIES UNTRUTHS AND DECEITFUL BY SENIOR FIGURES IN THE REMAIN CAMP
THIS FOLLOWS A WARNING BY BORIS JOHNSON THAT THE U.K. WILL BE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE Y. YOU BAIL OUTS FOR COUNTRIES LIKE GREECE AND TO A LOOMING INCREASE IN THE E.U. BUDGET
THIS DESPITE THE FACT MISTER CAMERON NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT IN FEBRUARY TO EXCLUDE BRITAIN FROM ANY BAIL OUTS AND THE FACT THAT U.K. HAS A VETO OVER ANY FUTURE BUDGET INCREASES LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS COUNTER THAT SUCH SAFEGUARDS ARE NOT CREDIBLE
MEANWHILE TORY BRECHT'S AT CAMPAIGNERS HAVE BEEN ANGERED BY MISTER CAMERON'S DECISION TO APPEAR ALONGSIDE SENIOR OPPOSITION POLITICIANS INCLUDING LABOUR'S HARRIET HARMAN AND THE LEADERS OF THE LIB DEMS AND THE GREEN PARTY TO ACCUSE THE LEAVE CAMP OF A CON TRICK AGAINST VOTERS FOR FAILING TO SET OUT THEIR ECONOMIC ALTERNATIVE TO MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U.
THE UPROAR OVER SIR JOHN MAJOR'S ONSLAUGHT ON BORIS JOHNSON YESTERDAY WHICH DOWNING STREET DENY ANY INVOLVEMENT IN ALSO CONTINUES WITH ONE CONSERVATIVE M.P. JACOB REES MOGG DISMISSING IT AS THE BITTER RAMBLINGS OF A VENGEFUL OLD MAN
THE B.B.C. HAS LEARNED THAT IF THERE'S A VOTE IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE E. USE SOME PRO REMAIN M.P. WOULD CONSIDER USING THEIR MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT TO KEEP BRITAIN INSIDE THE SINGLE MARKET THEY SAY THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS WOULD OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGE OF HAVING TO KEEP THE U.K.'S BORDERS OPENED TO E.U. WORKERS OUR CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE HAS THE STORY
IF PEOPLE VOTE FOR BRICKS IT WHAT KIND OF TRADING RELATIONSHIP MIGHT BRITAIN HAVE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION MANY PRO LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS WANT TO LOOSE FREE TRADE AGREEMENT BUT PRU REMAIN M.P.S CLAIM THIS WOULD DAMAGE THE ECONOMY BECAUSE THERE'LL BE MORE BARRIERS TO TRADE THAN NOW
SO A NUMBER OF THEM TORY LABOUR AN S.N.P. HAVE TOLD ME THEY WOULD USE THEIR OVERWHELMING MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO TRY TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO KEEP BRITAIN INSIDE THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET ONE MINISTER SPOKE OF A REVERSE MAASTRICHT REFERENCE TO THE BLOODY TORY BATTLES OVER EUROPE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES
STAYING IN THE SINGLE MARKET THEY WOULD COME AT A PRICE BRITAIN WOULD HAVE TO KEEP ITS BORDERS OPENED TO WORKERS DESPITE HAVING VOTED TO LEAVE IN PART TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION
LEAVE SPOKESMAN SAID M.P.S WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DEFY THE WILL OF THE ELECTORATE AND A BRITAIN OUTSIDE THE E.U. WOULD TAKE CONTROL OF ITS BORDERS AND ECONOMY
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T REGISTERED TO TAKE PART IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD OF BEING URGED TO DO SO BEFORE THE DEADLINE TOMORROW MOST PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED ABOUT HIM LAST CHANCE GENERAL ELECTION OR THE LOCAL ELECTIONS A MONTH AGO AND ROB READY SIGNED UP BUT IT'S ESTIMATED SIX MILLION POTENTIAL VOTERS AREN'T REGISTERED TO RECEIVE A BALLOT PAPER
SCIENTISTS IN CALIFORNIA USING A CONTROVERSIAL TECHNIQUE TO CREATE HUMAN ORGANS BY GROWING THEM INSIDE PIGS THEY'VE INJECTED HUMAN STEM CELLS CENTRE PIG EMBRYOS SINCE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS CREATING A HUMAN PANCREAS SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE ANIMALS COULD PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO THE WORLDWIDE SHORTAGE HUMAN ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANTS BUT OTHERS HAVE RAISED ETHICAL CONCERNS OUR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT FERGUS WALSH HAS THE STORY
THE SOUNDS YOU CAN HEAR A PREGNANT WITH EMBRYOS WHICH ARE PART PIG PART HUMAN WHAT ARE KNOWN AS CHIMERAS SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS JEAN EDITED THE PIG EMBRYOS TO REMOVE THE D.N.A. INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE A PANCREAS THEN THEY INJECTED HUMAN STEM CELLS IN THE HOPE THAT THESE WILL FILL THE GENETIC VOID AND GROW A HUMAN PANCREAS INSTEAD
THE SAME TECHNIQUE MIGHT ENABLE OTHER ORGANS TO BE GROWN FOR TRANSPLANT IF CELLS WERE TAKEN FROM PATIENTS THEN THE RESULTING ORGANS COULD BE TISSUE MATCHED TO PREVENT REJECTION
BUT THE RESEARCH IS CONTROVERSIAL THE MAIN U.S. MEDICAL RESEARCH AGENCY HAS REFUSED TO FUND CHIMERA EXPERIMENTS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS THAT PATIENT CELLS MIGHT MIGRATE TO THE PIGS DEVELOPING BRAIN AND MAKE IT MORE HUMAN
NONE OF THE U.S. TEAMS DOING THIS RESEARCH SAY THEY WILL ALLOW PIG HUMAN FOETUSES TO BE BORN UNTIL SUCH CONCERNS ARE RESOLVED
AND YOU CAN SEE MORE ON THIS ON PANORAMA TONIGHT AT EIGHT THIRTY ON B.B.C. ONE AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AND NINE SERIOUSLY INJURED IN A CRASH INVOLVING TWO TRAINS IN EASTERN BELGIUM THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE ROW NETWORKS HAD A PASSENGER SERVICE CRASHED INTO THE BACK OF A GOODS TRAIN NEAR THE CITY OF LEO
AND MARK'S STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT TAKING HORMONAL DRUGS FOR UP TO TEN YEARS CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF BREAST CANCERS RETURNING BY A THIRD THE FINDINGS COULD AFFECT THE TREATMENT OF MILLIONS OF WOMEN I HEALTH REPORTER JAMES GALLAGHER IS THAT THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY IN CHICAGO
NEARLY TWO MILLION WOMEN ARE DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER AROUND THE WORLD EACH YEAR MOST HAVE A CANCER THAT'S FUELLED BY THE FEMALE SEX HORMONE OESTROGEN AROMA IMITATES INHIBITORS WHICH STOP OESTROGEN PRODUCTION ARE TAKEN FOR FIVE YEARS TO STOP THE CANCER COMING BACK THE U.S. AND CANADIAN STUDY ON NEARLY TWO THOUSAND POST MENOPAUSAL WOMEN WHO WERE GIVEN THE DRUG FOR A DECADE SHOULD CANCER RECURRENCE WAS CUT BY A THIRD SOME WOMEN ALSO TOOK OTHER HORMONAL DRUGS BEFORE STARTING ON AROMA TASTE INHIBITORS SAID THEY COULD BE SPENDING FIFTEEN YEARS ON HORMONAL TREATMENT
EXPERTS FROM THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY IN THE INSTITUTE OF CANCER RESEARCH SO THE FINDINGS WERE A BIG DEAL AND COULD CHANGE TREATMENT FOR MILLIONS OF WOMEN BUT THE DRUGS INCREASE THE RISK OF BONE FRACTURES LOSS OF LIBIDO AND HOT FLUSHES SO EXPERTS BELIEVE THE EXTRA THERAPY WILL LIKELY BE TARGETED AT THOSE WOMEN AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF TUMOURS RECURRING
RESEARCHERS FROM CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY SAY ANXIETY IS A SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM WHICH NEEDS SPA GREATER ATTENTION WORK HAS CONFIRMED THAT WOMEN AND PEOPLE AGED UNDER THIRTY FIVE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY EXCESSIVE WORRY HE'S A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER
THESE RESEARCHERS EXAMINED FORTY EIGHT REVIEWS OF STUDIES INTO ANXIETY WHICH WERE CARRIED OUT AROUND THE WORLD SOME OF THEM IN THE U.K. PUBLISHING THEIR FINDINGS IN THE JOURNAL BRAIN AND BEHAVIOUR THEY FOUND THE OVERALL PROPORTION OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY ANXIETY REMAINED LARGELY UNCHANGED DURING THE PAST TWO DECADES BUT THE RESEARCHER SAID WOMEN WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY ANXIETY AS MEN AND YOUNGER MEN AND WOMEN WERE ALSO MORE PRONE TO SYMPTOMS SUCH AS PANIC ATTACKS
OR FEELINGS OF UNSHAKEABLE DREAD THE LEAD AUTHOR FROM CAMBRIDGE SUGGESTED THAT HORMONAL FLUCTUATIONS AND DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN CHEMISTRY COULD EXPLAIN THE HIGHER RATES AMONG WOMEN THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS SAID ONLINE TOOLS COULD HELP SUFFERERS SPOT PROBLEMS AND OFTEN THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM SIMPLE LIFESTYLE CHANGES
THE BODY OF MUHAMMAD ALI HAS ARRIVED IN HIS HOME TOWN OF LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY WHERE HIS FUNERAL WILL TAKE PLACE LATER THIS WEEK HIS COFFIN WAS DRIVEN FROM THE AIRPORT IN A MOTORCADE A CORRESPONDENT ALLY MC BULBOUS WATCHING THE COFFIN OF MUHAMMAD ALI WAS CARRIED DOWN FROM THE PLANE TO THE FLEET OF BLACK CARS THAT ARRIVED TO RECEIVE IT IT WAS A FINAL HOME COMING FOR A MAN THEY CALLED THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME
HIS FUNERAL WILL TAKE PLACE ON FRIDAY AND WHAT'S EXPECTED TO BE AN EVENT ATTENDED BY THOUSANDS HIS FAMILY SAY THEY'RE CARRYING OUT WISHES MUHAMMAD ALI HIMSELF HAD SPELLED OUT YEARS AGO TO BE BURIED IN THE CITY WHERE HE GREW UP TO HAVE AN INTERFAITH CEREMONY AND FOR IT TO HAPPEN AS A VENUE WHERE PEOPLE OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE COULD COME IT PROMISES TO BE AN EMOTIONAL DAY
LIMA BULL REPORTING THERE IS SEVEN IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW WAS YOUR HAND POISED ON THE OFF BUTTON OR THE VOLUME SWITCH YOU PREPARING TO BELLOW AT THE RADIO IF THAT IS I NOW SAY THOSE DREADED WORDS Y. U. AND REFERENDUM IF SO PLEASE PAUSE JUST A MINUTE YOU ARE NOT ALONE THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE FINDING WHAT SHOULD SURELY BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY LIBERATING MOMENT OF NATIONAL DEMOCRACY
A LITTLE LESS THAN INSPIRING SO LET'S PAUSE BRIEFLY TO EXAMINE WHY THAT MIGHT BE IT WHAT MIGHT BE DONE ABOUT IT WITH LESS THAN THREE WEEKS TO GO BEFORE DECISION DAY WOULD IT WERE DEBRA MATINS AND WHO'S THE FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF BRITAIN THINKS A COMPANY WHICH HAS BEEN RUNNING FOCUS GROUPS EXAMINING THE PUBLIC'S VIEWS ON EUROPE SHE WAS IN THE PAST GORDON BROWN'S POLLSTERS WELL GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOGETHER MORNING ARE PEOPLE SAYING TO YOU GOODNESS ME WE ARE FINDING THIS VERY VERY HEAVY GOING
YES THEY ARE THEY'RE FINDING IT VERY HEAVY GOING THERE BASICALLY THE PROBLEM THEY HAVE THOUGH IS THAT THEY KNOW THAT THIS MATTERS THEY KIND OF WANT TO BE INTERESTED IN IT BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE WATCHING THE CAMPAIGN'S THERE LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND THEY'RE REALLY STRUGGLING TO PLACE THEMSELVES IN THAT CAMPAIGN AND UNDERSTAND WHY IT MATTERS TO THEM NOW IS THE STRUGGLE BECAUSE OF COURSE WHEN WE VOTE AN ELECTION WE CAN OFTEN SAY
I'M A LABOUR MAN OR I'M A TORY WOMAN OR WE HAVE SOME BACKGROUND WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST TO US THE WAY WE SHOULD GO EVEN IF WE CHOOSE NOT TO GO WITH THAT TRADITION IS IT COS MANY PEOPLE FOR MANY PEOPLE THEY NEVER TAKEN A POSITION ON THE Y. YES THIS JUST ISN'T SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT AND THEY FIND A LOT OF THAT THEY FIND THE THINK THE DEBATE QUITE ABSTRACT THEY'RE REALLY STRUGGLING TO SEE WHAT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO THEM THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR VOCABULARY TO EM AND I GOT A DOING GROUPS JUST THREE WEEKS AGO A WOMAN SAID TO ME
ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES IN CAN I STOP YOU THERE WHAT'S THIS BRECK SIT THING THAT THAT YOU'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT SHE HAD LITERALLY NOT HEARD THAT EXPRESSION UNTIL THAT MOMENT MY RECOLLECTION IS UNTIL RECENTLY EUROPE WAS VERY VERY LOW ON THEIR LIST OF PRIORITIES THAT PEOPLE SAID THEY THOUGHT THE COUNTRY SHOULD FOCUS ON TRADITION IT WAS ALWAYS THE ECONOMY THE N.H.S. IMMIGRATION AT THE TOP YEAH I WAS DOWN BUT EIGHTH NINTH TENTH YES IT'S GONE UP TO NUMBER TWO IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO
IT'S HIP AND PEOPLE DEFINITELY KNOW THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT IT BUT THE PROBLEM IS THEY'RE REALLY STRUGGLING TO SEE HIM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN FOCUS GROUPS AS WE CAME OUT THE MORNING AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE WE DO THIS IN GENERAL ELECTIONS TO IT REALLY FOCUSES PEOPLE'S MIND HOW WILL YOU FEEL WAKE UP YET YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY THIS IS HAPPENED ALL THAT'S HAPPENED HOW DO YOU FEEL IN GENERAL ELECTIONS THEY FIND THIS VERY SOBERING GAMING THAT OUT FOR THE E.U. REFERENDUM PEOPLE ALIKE
CAN'T SEE THAT MY LIFE WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT IF THAT ONE WOMAN SAID ACTUALLY IT'S GREAT I CAN NOW GET ON WITH THE THINGS THAT MATTER SO STOP WORRYING ABOUT HOW INTRIGUING IN OTHER WORDS THE MAIN THING PEOPLE THINK OF ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN POLICY DECISION THIS COUNTRY'S TAKEN IN FORTY FIFTY YEARS THE MAIN THING IS THANK GOD WE WON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO BE OVER I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT LET'S TRY AND BE POSITIVE YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT THE GROUP'S ABOUT WHAT THEY DO WHAT THEY DO WANT TO HEAR OF YOUR MODERATOR
SO WILL ONE OF THE THINGS IS WHO THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY CRUCIAL THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAVE IS THAT THE MESSENGERS ARE NOT ON THE WHOLE PEOPLE THEY TRUST SO THEY ALL SEEM TO BE PEOPLE HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAY WHO WILL THIS MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THEY SAY WELL IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR POLITICIANS PARTICULARLY TORY POLITICIANS AND THIS IS AN INTERESTING POINT TWO SO THIS IS VERY MUCH A BLUE ON BLUE FIGHT AND ACTUALLY AGAIN A FOCUS GROUP COLIN SOMEBODY SAID
WHERE TO WHERE A LABOUR ON THIS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY THINK SO THEY'RE NOT SEEING ANY LABOUR VOICES BUT THEY'RE ALSO THERE WANTING TO HEAR FROM SOME PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE SKIN IN THERE GAME SUCH AS SO PEOPLE WHO THEY MARTYN LEWIS THE MONEY MAN
HE MIGHT KNOW HOW THIS MAKES MAKES A DIFFERENCE THE INDEPENDENT EXPERT INDEPENDENT EXPERTS YEAH BRIEF LAUGHS A LOT OF YOU WHAT DO YOU HAVE WORK WITH POLITICIANS FOR POLITICIANS IN CAMPAIGNS THEY DON'T WANT THESE CAMPAIGNS TO BE A DISASTER WHY MIGHT THEY BE BEHAVING IN THE WAY THEY ARE
I FEEL AS YOUR HEARING MORE AND MORE MESSAGES BEING SORT OF THROWN AT THE PUBLIC I FEEL THERE'S A SLIGHT SENSE OF PANIC ACTUALLY I THINK THAT THEY NEED A LOT MORE MESSAGE DISCIPLINE THEY NEED TO THINK WHAT'S THE MAIN THING TO GET OVER AND JUST KEEP SAYING IT AND SAYING IT AND STICK WITH THAT DEBORAH MATINS AND BRITAIN THINKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT WILL BE DISCUSSING WHAT THE CAMPAIGN MIGHT DO WITH THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THEM LATER IN THE PROGRAMME
THIRTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN TAKING HORMONAL DRUGS FOR AS LONG AS FIFTEEN YEARS REDUCES THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER COMING BACK THIS FINDING BY A RESEARCH TEAM IN NORTH AMERICA IS BEING DESCRIBED AS A VERY BIG DEAL IT COULD AFFECT THE TREATMENT OF MILLIONS OF WOMEN PROFESSOR DEM VALERIE BARREL IS DIRECTOR OF THE CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY UNIT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD AND IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND IT WAS IT'S A NORTH AMERICAN STUDY ISN'T IT QUITE A BIG STUDY AND ONE THAT YOU THINK HE'S READY CYGNET
I THINK JUST JUST TO SORT OF STEP BACK FOR ONE MOMENT ANY BREAST CANCER IS UNUSUAL AMONG CANCERS FOR MOST CANCERS IF YOU SURVIVE FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER IT WAS DIAGNOSED YOU IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO COME BACK AGAIN BUT FOR HORMONE NOVEL FOR HORMONE SENSITIVE BREAST CANCERS WHICH IS ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF BREAST CANCERS THERE'S A RECURRENCE AND STILL OCCUR TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AND EVEN LONGER AFTER THE CANCER WAS DIAGNOSED SO IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT IN THAT WAY
BUT IT'S ALSO KNOWN TO BE VERY TO BE VERY WELL TREATED OR VERY EFFECTIVELY TREATED BY
THERAPIES THAT BRA CORMAN'S NEVIS ONE HORMONE BLOCKING YOUR THERAPY CAUGHT HIM OXFORD WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME AND WE'VE KNOWN FOR A WHILE THAT TEN YEARS OF TIME OFFICER FERNY USE DOES
DOES OVERALL OVER THE TEN YEAR PERIOD REDUCE DEATHS FROM BREAST CANCER BY ABOUT HALF AT HARV'S BREAST CANCER RATES AND SO IT'S A VERY POWERFUL AND VERY IMPORTANT AFFECT THEIR OTHER DRUGS THAT MORE MODERN MORE EVEN BETTER THAN TIM OFF SEVEN THAT HADN'T BEEN AROUND SO LONG
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TRIAL HAD SHOWN THAT FIVE YEARS OF CHOCOLATE OF THAT TEN YEARS OF TO SOME VERSUS FIVE ACTUALLY IMPROVE SURVIVAL SO IT'S REALLY
MEMORY MIRRORING WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW WHEN IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT BUT DOES IT HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT DO YOU THINK ON OH YEAH WHAT ADVICE WOMEN ARE GIVEN I MEAN TODAY OH I DON'T KNOW THAT'S NOT MY ROLE I SHOULD HOPE SO OH YES I THINK SO BUT I THINK IT'S YES I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AND WOMEN AND I THINK I THINK WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER DO YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE HAD BREAST CANCER FOR FIVE YEARS AND MOST
OR PEOPLE ARE GIVEN HORMONE THERAPY IF THEY'VE GOT COMMENT SENSITIVE BREAST CANCER FOR FIVE YEARS BUT THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT ALTHOUGH THAT'S BEEN GOOD FOR THEM ANOTHER FIVE YEARS IT'S EVEN BETTER AND THE SIDE EFFECTS WELL THERE ARE SIDE EFFECTS I'M GOING TO BLITZ THAT BUT MOST PEOPLE CAN COPE WITH THEM THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN THE MAIN THING IS ON HORMONES OESTROGENS ARE VERY GOOD FOR THE BONES AND
WITH WITH THESE THERAPIES THAT BLOCK THE PRODUCTION OF OESTROGEN THE BONES ARE THINNER THAN I WOULD BE OTHERWISE AND THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK OF FRACTURE BUT THEY'RE VERY MINE IN THIS TRIAL OH VERY I'D SAVE A VERY MINOR FRACTURES THERE WERE VERY FEW SERIOUS FRACTURES LIKE A FRACTURE AND THE COST SIDE OF IT THERE ISN'T BUT PRETTY MINOR PRESUMABLY EXPLAINS THAT'S WHAT'S VERY INTERESTING IS HE TO MOCK SEVEN HAS BEEN AROUND DECADES ENDED COS LIKE IT'S A FEW IT'S A IT'S A ONE OR TWO HUNDRED POUNDS FOR
FOR A YEAR'S THERAPY NOW AROMA TASTE MEMBERS OF THE DRUGS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN TESTED I HOPE WERE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE BUT THEY'VE JUST THE PATENTLY JUST COME OFF THEM SO NOW THESE NEW DRUGS WHICH ARE BETTER THAN TO ROCKS OFFENCE AND AS I'M NOT SURE OF THE EXACT COST BUT THEY'RE ONLY IN THE ORDER OF HUNDREDS OF POUNDS A YEAR
AND THESE ARE REALLY REALLY YOU KNOW THAT AS THEY SAY IF THAT IF THAT IF THESE NEW DRUGS ARE SHOWN TO BE AS GOOD AS TO MARKSMAN AND ALL THE EVIDENCE SO FAR AS A BETTER IT COULD HALVE DEATH RATES FROM BREAST CANCER AND IN YOU KNOW IN THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE AND IN MOST WESTERN COUNTRIES DEATH RATES FROM BREAST CANCER HAD BEEN FALLING HAVE HALVED IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND IT'S LARGELY BECAUSE OF TO MOCKS A PHONE SO THIS NEW THESE NEW AROMA TASTE INHIBITOR DRUGS WHICH ARE NOW NOT EXPENSIVE I COULD EVEN FURTHER
LEAD TO EVEN FURTHER DECLINES IN BREAST CANCER MORTALITY THE INCIDENCE ISN'T GOING DOWN IT'S JUST THE DEATHS OF GROUND DOWN AND IT'S GOOD THERAPY PROFESSOR DAME VALERIE BERYL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES FOR U.K. OIL AND GAS FIRMS FURTHER JOB CUTS ARE FORECAST LUCY BURTON IS HERE TO TELL US MORE THANKS NICK AND RATHER DEPRESSING NEWS TO PEOPLE WORKING IN THE U.K.'S OIL AND GAS SECTOR
THE BANK OF SCOTLAND SAYS A THIRD OF BUSINESSES PLAN TO CUT JOBS FURTHER DURING THIS YEAR MORE THAN FOUR AND TURN ARE PLANNING TO CUT COSTS FURTHER THERE'S OF COURSE THANKS TO THE DOWNTURN IN THE INDUSTRY NOW SCOTLAND'S BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD WITH FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF COMPANY SURVEYED SAME HAD BEEN SEVERELY OR QUITE BADLY AFFECTED BY THE SLUMP IN OIL PRICES
WILL STUART WHITE AS AN OIL AND GAS EXPERT FROM THE BANK OF SCOTLAND HE JOINS US NOW FROM THE B.B.C.'S ABERDEEN STUDIO GOOD MORNING STUART JUST GIVE ME A SENSE OF HOW BAD THE PAST YEAR'S BEEN FOR THE INDUSTRY
WE COULD HAVE THE LAST TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR THE INDUSTRIES IT'S TRIED TO ADJUST TO THE OIL PRICE ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CUTS TO COURSE AND JOB LOSSES NASH AT THE SPORES ALSO HAS BEEN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR THE INDUSTRY
WHO DO YOU THINK'S BEEN HURT MORE SMALLER OR LARGER COMPANIES I THINK IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S AFFECTED THAT IN ANY ONE PARTICULAR POINT THE SUPPLY CHINTZ AFFECTED FIXED ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND BECAUSE IT'S A GLOBAL IMPACT IT'S NOT JUST THE LOCAL IMPACT EITHER
WHICH KIND OF BRINGS ME ON TO MY NEXT QUESTION IS THERE ANYTHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DOING TO HELP THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF COURSE AS YOU MENTION LOCAL IMPACT COMMUNITIES A QUARTER AFFECTED WHEN WE SEE YEARS LIKE
WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO THE INDUSTRY WITH OIL AND GAS AUTHORITY AND THE SCOTTISH AND U.K. GOVERNMENTS TAKING ACTION TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS A STABLE APART FROM AS THEY CAN TO SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY HAVELIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY A SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE AND AS A RESULT THE INDUSTRY IS DOING ALL IT CAN TO REDUCE ITS COURSE TO REFLECT THAT REDUCTION AND THE OVERALL OIL PRICE SO DOES THAT MEAN THEY'RE THINKING IN TERMS OF USING YOUR PROCESSES NEW TECHNOLOGIES HOW THEY TRYING TO COMBAT
ABSOLUTELY ALL OF THESE THINGS I THINK ONE OF THE KEY THINGS IS THAT THIS IS THIS IS A VERY ENTREPRENEURIAL INDUSTRY IT'S AN INDUSTRY THAT'S DEMONSTRATE A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESILIENCE IN THE PAST AND IS CONTINUING TO DO SO AND THE KEY THINGS AT THE MOMENT ARE CLEARLY TRYING TO SEEK EFFICIENCIES TRYING TO INTRODUCE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND TRENT INTRODUCED NEW WAYS OF WORKING TO DRIVE THAT COURSED AND THE EFFICIENCY COR STONE AND THE EFFICIENCY OP JUST FINALLY EASTER AND QUICKLY ARE THERE ANY HOPES THAT FRACKING MIGHT BE THE THING THAT CAN SAVE THE DAY
I THINK ONE OF THE INTERESTING FINDINGS FROM THE REPORT IS THAT INTEREST AND I'M SURE SHE'LL GAS HAS DROPPED FROM LAST YEAR TO JUST UNDER A THIRD OF ALL COMPANIES SO I THINK THAT THE KEY THING IS THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES DIVERSIFICATION REMAINS KEY BUT ALSO TO RENEW BALLS UTILITIES AND INTO OTHER OTHER DIFFERENT MARKETS FOR THEIR STREET STUART WHITE OIL AND GAS EXPERT AT THE BANK IT'S GONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LUCY IT'S TWENTY PAST SEVEN
POLLUTION KILLS OF THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT AROUND FORTY THOUSAND DEATHS IN THE U.K. CAN BE LINKED TO IT AIR POLLUTION EACH AND EVERY YEAR ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS SO CAN THE COURTS BE USED TO ESTABLISH THAT WE ALL HAVE A RIGHT A HUMAN RIGHT TO CLEAN
JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY ROSMAN KISS HE DEBORAH WHO LOST HER NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ELLA AFTER SHE SUFFERED A SEVERE ASTHMA ATTACK ONE OF A SERIES SHE'D HAD OVER A COUPLE OF YEARS THE FAMILY LIVED NEAR A VERY HEAVILY POLLUTED ROAD IN SOUTH LONDON AND ALSO BY A LAWYER JOCELYN COCKBURN IS A PARTNER AT LAW FIRM HODGE JAMES AND HELEN GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU AND THANK YOU FOR COMING IN THE STUDIO ROYAL HMM ROSAMUND
THIS ASTHMA CAME ON UNEXPECTEDLY FOR YOUR DAUGHTER BUT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY LIKE THAT WASN'T IT VERY MUCH SO IF IT CAME ON IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND TAG
BEFORE THAT PERIOD AND THERE WAS AN EXTREMELY HEALTHY CHILD SHE WASN'T KNOWN TO ANY OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES AT ALL AND SHE BASICALLY COS A VIRUS AND I'M SURE A LOT OF PARENTS CAN RECOGNISE THAT THIS MORNING WHEREBY YOUR CHILD HAS A VIRUS YOU TAKE THE CHILD TO THE G.P. TO GIVE THE CHILD OUT TO YOU
BUT BIOTICS AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE AS SIMPLE AS THAT HOWEVER AS WE DISCOVERED DURING THE HALF TERM BREAK THE VIRUS DIDN'T SEEM TO GO AWAY AND WE WENT BACK TO THE G.P. AGAIN AND THIS TIME SHE GAVE US SOME STRONGER ANTI
BIOTICS HOWEVER SHE BEGAN TO BE A BIT CONCERNED BECAUSE HER SYMPTOMS WERE NOT IMPROVING AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS AND THERE DEVELOPED A SEVERE COUGH WHICH JUST WOULDN'T GO AWAY
BUT AT THAT STAGE NO NONE OF US WAY THE WISER ABOUT WHAT WAS TO CONSCIOUS AT ALL HAD TERRIBLE THING TO WATCH HIS OR HER TO PRESUME HE HAD NO IDEA THAT IT MIGHT ADD TO THE DEATH OF YOUR ABSOLUTELY NOT ENDS I WILL REMEMBER TO THIS DAY THE FIRST TIME SHE HAS A SEIZURE WHICH WAS ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF
DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND TANG IT HAPPENED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING AND I MUST CONFESS YOU KNOW WHERE SHE WENT BLUE I ACTUALLY THOUGHT SHE HAD DIED
THAT MOMENT THAT DAY THAT SECONDS AND IT WAS
FOR A NEIGHBOUR ME SCREAMING AND NEIGHBOUR ACTUALLY HERE IN ME WHO ACTUALLY CLAIM AND WHO HELPED RESUSCITATOR WE CALLED THE AMBULANCE AND STILL I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST GOING TO BE A ONE OFF THING BECAUSE
BUT THERE ARE A SERIES OF ATTACK THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS ATTACKS AND WARM MADE YOU BELIEVE OR ARE YOU SIMPLY TRYING TO FIND OUT THAT THE POLLUTION IN THE AREA SOUTH LONDON YOU LIVIN AND WAS THE CAUSE OF YOUR DAUGHTERS WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT I MEAN THOSE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA WE ALL KNOW IN LONDON THE POLLUTION LEVELS ARE QUITE HIGH THAT DOESN'T HELP HOW MUCH THAT CONTRIBUTED IS YET TO BE ESTABLISHED AND I MUST STRESS THAT AT HIS ASTHMA WAS INCREDIBLY C.V.A. SO I DON'T WANT TO FRIGHTEN ANYONE THIS MORNING BUT
IT IS OUTSTANDING WE STILL DON'T KNOW SHE HAD SOME TRIGGERS SHE WAS TESTED FOR THE MOST COMMON THINGS WHICH SHE WASN'T ALLERGIC TO SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS PARTICLES IN THE AIR AIRBORNE SOMETHING UNUSUAL MAYBE AND THEY TURNED YOUR LAWYER IF I MAY ROSMAN FORSAKEN JOCELYN WHO'S NEXT TO YOU WHAT IS IT THE HE CONVINCED YOU THAT THIS WAS A CASE WORTH PURSUING
WELL I HAD SEPARATELY BECOME INTERESTED IN POLLUTION IN SUFFER ASTHMA MYSELF AND WHAT ELLA ELLA'S CASE
SAID TO ME WAS THERE HAD BEEN AN INQUEST BUT IT HADN'T LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE OF POLLUTION IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY TO ME
THAT THIS ISSUE HAD NEVER BEEN RAISED EVEN BY THE MEDICS AND I E. I THINK ALSO ROSALIND HAD SEEN THE NEWS REPORTS ABOUT
THE DEATHS AND THE EFFECTS OF POLLUTION AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS A CASE OF PUTTING TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND REALISING THAT THIS BIG ISSUE WAS SOMEHOW BEING OVERLOOKED AND IN THE CASE YOU'RE PURSUING
DO YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT HER DEATH WAS DIRECTLY LINKED TO POLLUTION OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE IN COURT
WELL WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AT THE MOMENT IS TO GET A PROPER WIDER INVESTIGATION LOOKING AT POLLUTION AND WHETHER IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATH OF ELLEN NOW IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO SHOW THAT IT'S ARGUABLE THAT POLLUTION MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO HER DEATH SO IT'S NOT A VERY HIGH THRESHOLD
AND GIVE HIM WHERE THEY DID FAMILY LIVES WHICH IS WHAT MADE THE SOUTH CIRCULAR ABSOLUTELY IT IS THESE ARE MUCH HIGHER LEVELS THAN THE LEGAL LIMITS OF POLLUTION VERY MUCH SO AT THIS I MEAN IT IS A FEELING I HAVE HAD BUT I'M SURE JUSTIN AND I HAVE SPOKEN AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE READINGS SO AND SEE WHAT THE LEVELS ARE
THERE IS A ROAD AWAY FROM US THAT HAS BEEN MEASURED THEIR END THE POLLUTION LEVELS IS VERY HIGH SO I KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT SOME SORT OF BRACING MYSELF YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT REALLY FOR THE DATA TO CONFIRM WHAT YOU FIT I MENTIONED THE POSSIBILITY OF A HUMAN RIGHTED THERE IS SOME HUMAN RIGHTS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN LAW IS THEY'RE NOT THE RIGHT CLEANER WELL IT IT'S NOT
DIE ERE HUMOUR RIGHT DIRECTS THE CLEANER BUT THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND REQUIRES THAT THE GOVERNMENT TAKES REASONABLE STEPS TO AVERT RISKS TO PEOPLE WHO KNOWS HER IMMEDIATE RISK NOW ELLA IS SOMEONE WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY AN IMMEDIATE RISK
OF AIR POLLUTION SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT TOOK REASONABLE STEPS JUST A BRIEF LAST ONE IF WE COULD ROSAMUND OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY'RE A SERIES OF ATTACKS YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THIS WAS WAS THIS SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT POLLUTION IF SHE WERE
STILL ABLE TO BE WITH THIS WOULD SHE BE FIGHTING THIS FIGHT DO THINK VERY MUCH SO BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SHE WAS ALSO INCREDIBLY FIT AND SHE USED TO CYCLE SO SHE USED TO WEAR A CYCLE MASK IT WAS SOMETHING SHE WAS VERY AWARE OF WHAT THEY WANTED WAS ANSWERS SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHY SHE HAD THIS ILLNESS WHY IT WAS SO SEVERE AND WHY A LOT OF THE MEDICINES WERE NOT WORKING AND IF SHE WERE HERE SHE WOULD LITERALLY BE SITTING IN THIS CHAIR AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ASK AT DIRECTLY BUT SADLY SHE'S NO LONGER
WITH US WE WERE DELIGHTED YOU WERE ABLE TO BE HERE AND TO SPEAK ON HER BEHALF AT LEAST ROSMAN KISS DEBORAH JUST LINK OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU

THE PUBLIC APPETITE ACROSS EUROPE IS GROWING EVER LOOSER RATHER THAN EVER
REPORTING THE TIME NINETEEN MINUTES EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND CONSERVATIVE PAPERS LAY INTO DAVID CAMERON AND SIR JOHN MAJOR FOR WHAT THE MALE CALLS ON EDIFYING PERSONAL ATTACKS ON PARTY OPPONENTS IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN FOR THE SUN IT'S A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS WHEN A FORMER PRIME MINISTER RESORTS TO INSULTS TO MAKE THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. SUCH AS HIS STINGING REMARKS ON THE ANDREW MARR SHOW YESTERDAY THE PRESSURE OF A BAD WEEK FOR THE REMAIN CAMP
CLEARLY GOT TO SIR JOHN IT IT'S THE TELEGRAPH TAKES MISTER CAMERON TO TEST FOR SHARING A PLATFORM LATER TODAY WITH MEMBERS OF OPPOSITION PARTIES TO IT SAYS LAMBASTED TORY LEADERS THE PAPER POINTS OUT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER REFUSES TO DEBATE DIRECTLY WERE LEADING MEMBERS OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SO AS TO AVOID BLUE ON BLUE CLASHES BUT IT GOES ON HOW DOES THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER APPEARING WITH HARRIET HARMAN SERVE CONSERVATIVE UNIT
MEANWHILE THE FINANCIAL TIMES SAYS BUSINESS LEADERS MUST DO MORE TO SPEAK UP ON WHAT IT CALLS THE DANGERS OF BRECHT'S WIDER DIVERSITY OF VOICES IS URGENTLY NEEDED SIGNING LETTERS IS NOT ENOUGH IT SAYS EVERY C. A. C. E. OUGHT TO BE SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THEIR EMPLOYEES TO SPELL OUT THE PERSONAL CONSEQUENCES OF LEAVING TO STAY SILENT IT WOULD BE GROSSLY A RESPONSE
MANY TRAVEL INSURANCE POLICIES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE WORTHLESS ACCORDING TO A STUDY IN THE TIMES THE PAPERS AS POLICIES ARE FAILING TO PROTECT FAMILIES AGAINST EVEN THE MOST BASIC OF HOLIDAY MISHAPS INCLUDING MISSED FLIGHTS LOST BAGS AND MEDICAL BILLS THE WEBSITE COMPARE THE MARKET ANALYSE SINGLE TRIP POLICIES AND FOUND THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF TRAVELLERS DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'D PAID FOR FORTY NINE PRESENTER POLICIES COVERED VALUABLES WORTH ONLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS OR LESS NOT ENOUGH THEREFORE TO PAY FOR THE COST OF LOST LAPTOPS EYE PADS
HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL CAMERAS OR JEWELLERY AND FINALLY ONE OF BRITAIN'S LEADING WINE EXPERT HAS COME TO THE RESCUE OF DRINKERS DIVIDED OVER THE BEST WAY TO STORE A LEFTOVER BOTTLE OF RED WINE PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE WITH THE WHITE ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH JANCIS ROBINSON TOLD THE HAY FESTIVAL THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT IT STAYED FRESHER FOR LONGER SHE SAID LOW TEMPERATURES SLOW DOWN CHEMICAL REACTIONS INCLUDING OXIDATION WHICH WAS THE ENEMY OF AN OPEN BOTTLE
SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WE HAVE SADLY BECOME ALL TOO USED TO HEARING NEWS OF JOURNALIST DYING IN WAR ZONES THIS MORNING WE HEAR THE NEWS ABOUT ONE WHO WORKS FOR WHAT MANY SEE AS AN AMERICAN VERSION OF THE TODAY PROGRAMME ALL THINGS CONSIDERED ON NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO
HE WAS DAVID GILKEY YOU DIED ALONG WITH HIS AFGHAN TRANSLATOR WHEN THE ARMY CONVOY THEY WERE TRAVELLING WITH CAME UNDER FIRE WHAT MADE DAVID REALLY UNUSUAL THOUGH WAS THAT HE WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR A RADIO NETWORK HAD BEEN SPEAKING TO HIS COLLEAGUE R. SHAPIRO HOST OF ALL THINGS CONSIDERED WHO'D RECENTLY BEEN ON A TRIP WITH HIM AND TO SCOTT SIMON HOST OF M. P. WEEKEND EDITION SATURDAY AND A FRIEND OF DAVID GILKEY
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN TO BE WITH THEM I WAS A GREAT ADMIRER OF HIS TELL YOU NO HE WASN'T LIKE A A KIND OF COURT FOR CARGO IT WOULDN'T TAKE A PICTURE OF THE HOST OF THE FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT HOLDING THE MICRA TRON UNDERSHOT BUT HE'S LEFT SHE WOULD GET IT
THE SCENE OF SOME SORT OF EVENT A STORY YOU WERE DOING AND HE WOULD GO OFF AND COME BACK WITH PICTURES AND IMAGES THAT MANAGED TO BOTH TELL THE STORY MORE ATTRACTIVELY THE MILITARY YOU DID ANTRIM A WHOLE OTHER GIFT OR SHE WASN'T
IT WASN'T A TRADITIONAL MILITARY JARGON FOR ALTHOUGH WE WON ON THE ORCHARD THEM AS AS WHAT A RITUAL A MAN WHO TOOK PORTRAITS OF PEOPLE GO OFF AND MAKE IT END THE R. IF YOU GO TO A WAR ZONE IF YOU GO TO A WAR ZONE WITH AN AMERICAN ACCENT IT REQUIRES A LOT DOES IT NOT TO PERSUADE YOUR SUBJECTS TO RELAX ENOUGH TO SHOW YOU WHO THEY REALLY ARE HOW DID DAVID DO THAT HE WAS PHYSICALLY IMPOSING AND YET HE HAD SUCH A GENTLE AIR ABOUT
HE HAD THIS VERY KIND OF SLOW GENTLE ENERGY AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU THINK OF AWARDS ON LIKE AFGHANISTAN HE HAD BEEN GOING THERE FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS HIS FIRST TRIP TO AFGHANISTAN
NINE ELEVEN YOU WENT ON AT HULL BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET INTO AFGHANISTAN BACK THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD GET PERMISSION AND SO HE KNEW THIS STORY SO WELL THE CULTURE OF THE PEOPLE HE WAS REPORTING ON HE KNEW THE DYNAMICS NOT ONLY OF THE U.S. MILITARY THE BRITISH MILITARY THE AFGHAN MILITARIA BUT OF THE VARIOUS TRIBES AND CULTURE AS THAT OF SWIRLED THROUGH THE COUNTRY THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GROW EM AND UNCOVER THE STORIES WITH HIS CAMERA
THAT WERE A DEEPER THAN ALMOST ANY REPORTER I KNOW DID YOU R.E. FOR EVER FIND IT CURIOUS THE IDEA OF HAVING A PHOTOGRAPHER WITH YOU GIVEN THAT YOU'RE USED TO PAINTING IMAGES IN THE MINDS OF YOUR LISTENERS
NOT AT ALL BECAUSE BEFORE I WORKED WITH DAVID I ADMIRED HIS WORK AND SO I LISTEN TO STORIES ON THE RADIO AND THEN I WOULD GO TO THE M.P. A WEB IT GENTLY OR YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE HIS PHOTOS THERE NOW AND I KNEW THE LEVELS OF DEPTH THAT HIS IMAGES WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL I STARTED TO WORK WITH THEM WAS HOW SEAMLESSLY IN CAILEAG THE COORDINATES WITH A RADIO REPORTER BECAUSE OF COURSE WHEN YOU HAVE A MICROPHONE ON THE CLICKING OF A CAMERA IN THE BACKGROUND AS THE WORST POSSIBLE
THAT TAKES YOU OUT OF THE SCENE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET WITH THE AUDIO AND SO AS WE WOULD BE CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS TO A TRANSLATOR HE KNEW THE PART OF THE INTERVIEW THAT I WOULD NEVER NEED TO USE WAS WHEN OUR INTERPRETER WAS ASKING MY QUESTION IN THE LOCAL LANGUAGE AND THAT WAS WHEN HE WOULD SHOOT THE PHOTOGRAPHS AND IT DIDN'T MATTER IF IT WAS YOU KNOW ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND WE WERE IN A STAIGH FON LITTLE MUD HUT HE STAYED THERE TO GET THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE BEAM OF SUNLIGHT COMING THROUGH THE ROOF AND LANDING ON
THE MAN'S HAND HOLDING THESE PRECIOUS GRAINS OF RICE THAT'S ONE IMAGE FROM OUR TRIP LAST MONTH AN INDIA THAT WILL JUST STAY WITH ME AND SCOTT YOUR LAST CONVERSATION WITH HIM WAS ABOUT WHETHER YOUR DAUGHTER SHOULD FOLLOW HIM INTO BECOMING A PHOTOGRAPHER WELL YOU KNOW I ENCOURAGE I GUESS WAS THE FOURTH FLOOR OF A BUILDING AND I'VE JUST COME BACK FROM A FAMILY TRIP WE WERE NO I KNOW I KNOW DAVID SOMETHING TERRIBLE'S HAPPENED THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS THAT SHE WANTED TO BECOME A PHOTOGRAPHER
AND HE SMILED AND SAID YOU KNOW WELL I AM MAN YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT IT A BIT MORE AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I HAVE HER COME IN AND I SAID BUT YOU KNOW SHE'S AT SCHOOL UNUSABLE WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE'S EVER COMMIT AND WILL TALK ABOUT THE SHOW HER SOME STUFF THEM
THERE WOULD'VE BEEN NO I.D. THEY WOULD'VE BEEN NOBODY BETTER NOBODY I WOULD'VE TRUSTED MORE SCOTT R.E. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR MEMORIES OF HER TREASURED COLLEAGUE
TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THE SPEAKER A NEWCASTLE STUDIO THIS MORNING AT THE REVEREND PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON PRINCIPAL OF SAINT JOHN'S COLLEGE DURHAM UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
TWENTY YEARS AGO FOOTBALL CAME HOME IN EURO NINETY SIX AND IN THE COMING WEEKS EVEN FIFTY YEARS OF HURT WILL NOT STOP ME DREAMING THAT WAYNE ROONEY LIFTS HENRI DE LONELY CUP IN WINNING THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP
BUT BEHIND WHAT HAS BECOME A MEDIA AND FINANCIAL JUGGERNAUT IS A STORY OF FAITH AND HOPE
I THINK ENGLAND MY CLAIM TO BE THE HOME OF FOOTBALL INTERNATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN FRANCE THREW HENRI DE LOONY AND HIS PREDECESSOR AS PRESIDENT OF THE FRENCH FOOTBALL FEDERATION JEWELS REMADE
THEY WERE THE ARCHITECTS OF BOTH THE WORLD CUP AND THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP AND REPRESENTED A MORALITY VERY DIFFERENT TO RECENT REPORTS OF FISH FOR SECRET BONUSES FOR REMAKE IN PARTICULAR FOOTBALL WAS A NETWORKING ABYSS FAITH
INSPIRED BY CATHOLIC SOCIAL TEACHING HE TOOK THE VIEW THAT SPORT WAS IMPORTANT TO GOD AND TO THE FUTURE SHAPING OF SOCIETY
IN HIS TWENTIES HE FOUNDED A SPORTS CLUB WHICH WAS DISTINCT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST IT OPPOSED THE VIEW THAT SPORT WAS THE PRESERVE OF GENTLEMEN AND AMATEURS AND SO AS CLUB DIDN'T DISCRIMINATE ON RACE OR CLASS
SECONDED INCLUDE A FOOTBALL WHICH AT THE TIME THE FRENCH LOOKED DOWN UPON AS ONLY FOR THUGS PROFESSIONALS AN ENGLISHMAN
HE BELIEVED THAT FOOTBALL COULD POSITIVELY CHANNEL NATIONALISM PROVIDE HEALING AND RELIEVE THE MORAL AND PHYSICAL SUFFERING OF THE POOR BUT ONLY IF IT WAS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL SOCIAL CLASSES HIS DREAM WAS THAT FOOTBALL WOULD SPREAD THE CHRISTIAN VIRTUES OF HARD WORK HONESTY COMRADESHIP AND FAIR PLAY
EXTREME WASN'T EASY TO ACHIEVE AND HAD TO BE WORKED OUT WITHIN THE HARSH POLITICAL REALITIES WHICH WERE COSTLY TO REMAKES TIME ENERGY AND REPUTATION
HIS EXAMPLE IS A REMINDER OF THE WAY THAT FAITH AT ITS BEST CAN BE INSPIRING RATHER THAN OPPRESSIVE FURTHER IT'S ABOUT THE ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE WORLD FOR GOOD RATHER THAN JUST A PRIVATISED COMFORT BLANKET
INDEED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS WITHIN THE EULOGIES TO MUHAMMAD ALI'S GREATNESS AND HUMAN WEAKNESS THERE IS A STORY OF FAITH WHICH WAS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE MAN WHO IN THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA FOUGHT FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SPOKE OUT WHEN OTHERS WOULDN'T
SPORT IS A KEY PART OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND COMMUNITY AND I SEE IT AS A GIFT FROM GOD
IT'S COMMERCIALISATION ON THE WORLD STAGE AS INEVITABLE AND IT'S OPEN TO ALL KINDS OF ABUSE BUT IT STILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO UNITE US AND GIVE US GLORIOUS PICTURES OF WHAT HUMANITY CAN ACHIEVE
WHATEVER INKLING DO IN THE COMING WEEKS FOR ME IN THE WORDS OF THE SONG JEWELS REMADE IT WILL STILL BE GLEAMING
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON TIME HIS TEN TO EIGHT WHAT DOES AMERICA HAVE TO LEARN FROM THE WAY THAT EUROPE BEHAVES THE FILM MAKER MICHAEL MOORE AS FIERY ANOTHER BROADSIDE AT HIS NATION HIS LATEST DOCUMENTARY OUT HERE THIS WEEK IS ENTITLED WHERE TO INVADE NEXT AND HE BRINGS
HIS FILM CREW TO EUROPE WHERE HE SUGGEST THAT AMERICA SHOULD INVADE IN A FRIENDLY WAY IN ORDER TO LEARN HOW MUCH FINER LIFE IS IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HUMANE PRISONS AND A BETTER WORK LIFE BALANCE IS HIS FILM A REASONABLE EFFORT TO GET AMERICA TO BE MORE HUMANE OR A WORK OF FICTION THAT FAILS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE GENIUS OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL POWERHOUSE THE UNITED STATES I'VE BEEN TALKING TO
THE MESSAGE FOR EUROPEANS EUROPEAN BUT OF THE SINEW
YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD PULSE
TRYING TO GET RID OF THEM STOP PICKING AT HER SCISSORS TO THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET
I CAN PROBABLY BRITAIN MORE THAN ANY OF THE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO LEARN FROM THE FILM
THE U.K. HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE LIKE BEING OUT THERE
THEY HAVE TO POINT OUT SOME BUT IT IS THE U.K. HAS GIVEN UP
IN MANY WAYS IN THE GREAT PLAINS THEY ARE BUT THEY ARE USED THE THINGS HE BELIEVED IN THE PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE IT SHOULD DO THAT ON PEOPLE
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO HANG ON THEM FRANCE IN GERMANY
AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD PEOPLE STILL ON THE DAY
WOULD DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU WERE GOING TO WATCH IT TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT HOW YOU ARE
HOW ARE YOUR AND DREAMED OF PEOPLE BUT IT'S A VERY ROSY PICTURE OF EUROPE IN A VERY UN ROSY PICTURE OF THE UNITED STATES AND YOU COULD EASILY HAVE DONE THE OPPOSITE COULDN'T YOU FOCUSED ON THE PRISONS IN NORWAY WHICH ARE RATHER WELL RUN AND THE FACT THAT YOU GET A LOT OF HOLIDAY IN ITALY AND ALL THE REST OF IT YOU COULD HAVE FOCUSED ON
YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN ITALY COULD HAVE FOCUSED ON ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE HORRIBLE YOU REPENT GREAT BUT SHE CHOSE NOT TO IN A SENSE IN A SENSE I SUPPOSE THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH YOU WILL SAY WILL LOOK JUST FOCUS ON DIFFERENT THINGS FOCUS ON YOU FOCUS ON HOW AWFUL THINGS IN AMERICA LIKE VIOLENCE IN PRISONS IT ET-CETERA YOU COULD'VE FOCUSED ON AMERICA'S GREAT UNIVERSITIES YOU COULD HAVE FOCUSED ON GOOGLE AND HE HAD A MASK AND ALL THE REST OF IT PEOPLE COMING TO AMERICA
DOES THE MESSAGE IS THE MESSAGE NOT DAMAGED DID THAT BY THE WAY YOU'VE CHOSEN TO SKEW IT NO JUST THE OPPOSITE I SPEAK VERY QUICKLY FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM BUT I'M GOING TO EUROPE
TO PICK UP FLOWERS AT THE WEEDS BUT L.M. PRICK WAVY AMERICAN PUBLIC WHAT NEWS WEEK YET OF YOURS
ALWAYS NEGATIVE YET ALWAYS THIS NOT WORKING
EMPLOYMENT SO HIGH THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE REFUGEES LOOK AT WHAT A MATCH EUROPE
THE MOVIE IN THE UNITED STATES AND AMERICANS WIFE'S AS MOVIE
THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET PLAY A WEEK
WITH PAY OR THERE IF YOU GET PREGNANT AND HAVE A BABY YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK NEXT WEEK YEAH BE ACTUALLY THAT'S THE WAY A LOT OF THE WORLD
THEY HAVE PAID MATERNITY LEAVE THEY HAVE A PEE
I WANTED TO SHOW ESPECIALLY MARCO AMERICANS ALL THE THINGS THAT YOUR QUEEN BUT COULD COULD AMERICA STILL DO THOSE THINGS THOSE MORE EUROPEAN THINGS AND I JUST MADE MY POINT
WE USED TO DO THE WHOLE THING HAVE YOU TOOK A LOT OF OUR IDEA AND ONE PART WHAT OTHER PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION
AND A LOT OF THAT WITH THE WAY THAT WE DO CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN THINGS LIKE
WE HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA AND THEN WE CARRY GAVE UP
YOU MENTIONED RING ME HOW COME IN OR YOU COULD MAKE A ROSY PICTURE OF UP UNITED STATES AND POINT OUT HOW WE HAVE GOO BALL AND WE HAVE GREAT UNIVERSITY
WELL FIRST OF ALL ON GREAT UNIVERSITIES WOW I MEAN THAT WAS A PRETTY PATHETIC PATHETIC PLACE IN TIME
IF YOU CAN YOU TELL ME I KNOW BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT OF COURSE THERE'S A LOT OF AMERICANS REALLY STRUGGLE TO GET TO COLLEGE BUT THE FACT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP I DONATE FIFTY OR SO UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD AND MANY MANY MANY OF IN IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE TOP TEN ALMOST ALL OF THEM IF YOU WANT TO DO CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH IF YOU WANT TO START A BUSINESS AND TRANSFORM THE WORLD YOU DON'T GO TO ITALY TO SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT YOU'LL KNOW WHEN WE DID IT WHEN HE GAVE THE U.S.A. YEAH WHEN WE GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THEM ARE BOOKED A STATISTIC FROM A FEW YEARS AGO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE
THIS YEAR BUT I DOUBT THAT IT'S CHANGED
THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR TOP TWO HUNDRED UNIVERSES YOU CAN GET IN ENGLISH LIT DEGREE WITHOUT TAKING A SINGLE CHORD
WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF EVICTION
WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF ARTS AND MUSIC
WE DON'T EVEN GENERATING ANY MORE HE'S A HERE'S ANOTHER POINT THEN DID WOULD YOU ACCEPT THIS THAT ACTUALLY ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT
ARE ON THE CUSP OF HAPPENING VIA BERNIE SANDERS OR IF NOT BURNEY SON AS THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL HE'S DONE SO WELL AND IN A WAY THAT NOBODY EXPECTED AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IF NOT VIA HIM IF HE FAILS IN THE END THIS TIME ROUND THEN VIA THE MOVEMENT THAT HE STARTED OH I AGREE WITH THAT ENTIRELY YES BECAUSE
EVEN THOUGH WE MADE THIS MOVIE BEFORE HE ANNOUNCED WE STARTED I'LL BE BEFORE HE NOWT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
THE MOVIE IS ESSENTIALLY FOR AMERICANS EXHIBIT A. OF BERNIE'S IDEA
ARE IN PLATTER IN WHAT HE NOW WORKING IN COUNTRIES MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD HERE
WHOA YOU KNOW THE PIE IN THE SKY IDEAS THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN AFFORD BEAR IS NOW IN MEMBERS FILMS WAS SLOVENIA CAN AFFORD
PORTUGAL CAN AFFORD IT IN FINLAND CAN AFFORD
SO YES OBVIOUSLY A PRESIDENT THING END
A WOULD BE THE BEST THING IN MY HUMBLE OPINION THROUGH THIS COUNTRY BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THIS TIME
WE DO NOT LIKE THAN YOU IF YOU'VE LEARNT ANYTHING IN THE SELECTION HERE IT'S DOMINIC
CRYSTAL BALL THEY WERE ON
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS HERE LEADING UP TO THE CONDEMNED
AND SO THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT GRABBING OUT THAT'S WHY HE STILL FIGHTING THE STILL
PRIMARY IS IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS
AND AND HE'S GOING TO FIGHT FOR THE SUPER DELEGATE
AND I WOULDN'T I WOULD QUESTION ANYBODY TO SAY ANYTHING AS OPERATORS POINT BUT IT AND WHAT'S INTERESTING PERHAPS IS THAT IT'S NOT OVER EVEN IF HE LOSES THIS TIME ROUND BECAUSE HE STARTS SOMETHING THAT REALLY DOES BRING THE KIND OF IDEAS THAT THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE KIND OF THINGS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IN INTO THE AMERICAN MAINSTREAM INTO THE DEBT AS WELL ABSOLUTELY I MEAN CONSIDER ABOUT AMIR
CALLS HIMSELF A SOCIALIST IN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TONIGHT
FORTY SIX PERCENT OF ALL THE DELEGATES TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND
I MEAN THAT I MEAN HE'S WON FORTY SEX APPEAL LIKEABLE DELEGATE
HE HAD TO PRESENT A SOCIALIST IN THIS COUNTRY
THAT THIS MOVEMENT IS GOING TO GO ANYWHERE
PROPELLED BY YOUNG PEOPLE THEY AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE IT'S THEIR FUTURE THEY'RE ADAMANT ABOUT THESE THINGS AND
AND WE WATCHED HILARY
LEFT NOW PAY HIM SO MUCH HAS TRIED TO JOIN HIM IN ORDER TO WIN

THROUGH THE MIDDLE PARTS OF THE DAY AND FURTHER NORTH AND WEST THROUGH WALES NORTHWEST ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND SOUTHWEST SCOTLAND HERE PARTICULARLY BY THIS AFTERNOON I THINK WE WILL SEE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS SOME OF THOSE SHOWERS HEAVY WITH SOME HAIL AND SOME THUNDER A LOT OF RAIN IN A SHORT SPACE OF TIME POSSIBLY SOME POOR TRAVELLING CONDITIONS ALSO FOR THE EXTREME EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND
THE EXTREME EAST COAST OF ENGLAND HERE BIT OF LOW CLOUD COMING AND GOING FROM TIME TO TIME THAT COULD HOLD TEMPERATURES BACK TO FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN DEGREES COME FURTHER WEST TWENTY FIVE TO MAYBE TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES IN PLACES THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT SOME SHOWERS CONTINUE IN PARTS OF THE WEST BUT IT WILL BE DRY A MUGGY ELSEWHERE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TONIGHT WILL SELF EMBARKS ON A MEANINGFUL SEARCH FOR ANSWERS
MEANING OF LIFE I DON'T KNOW FIND OUT WHEN I GET THERE
WILL SELF EXPLORES THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR EXISTENCE AND ASK SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS WHY DO WE EXIST I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE HERE IF WE DID KNOW THE ANSWER WE WOULD ALL BE GUARDS
WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING A LINEAR STRUCTURE IN WHICH WE PRESENT A SERIES FOR ARGUMENTS
BUT RATHER WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A KIND OF SOUNDED ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE HOPE YOU THE LISTENER WILL MAKE UP YOUR OWN
SELF SEARCH FOR MEANING ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR TONIGHT AT ELEVEN
IN THE NEXT HOUR WE WILL BE EXPLORING THE IDEA THAT THE THING THAT IS MISSING IN ALL OF OUR LIVES IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SILENCE
THERE WASN'T THAT NICE YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WERE JUSTIN WEBB AND WITH NICK ROBINSON
GOOD MORNING IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE SIXTH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING BRICKS IT CAMPAIGNERS SAY BRITAIN COULD BE FORCED TO MAKE BILLIONS OF POUNDS OF EXTRA PAYMENTS IF IT REMAINS A MEMBER OF THE E.U. CLAIMS DISMISSED AS LIES AND UNTRUTHS BY THEIR OPPONENTS
SCIENTISTS IN CALIFORNIA ATTEMPTING TO GROW HUMAN ORGANS IN PIGS AND EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE EFFECT ON THE ANIMALS' BRAINS
A LANDMARK STUDY HAS FOUND THAT WOMEN HAVE HAD BREAST CANCER HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF STAYING CLEAR OF THE DISEASE IF THEY TAKE HORMONAL DRUGS FOR TEN YEARS AND BUSY NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY CORI CORFIELD
BEATING BREAKS IT CAMPAIGNERS HER BORN THAT A BOAT TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. COOKING OF BRITAIN WITH THE MULTI BILLION POUND BILL THEY SAY THE U.K. COULD BE MADE TO PAY TOWARDS BUDGET RISES BRUSSEL SPUGGIE YOUR ASCENT BAIL OUTS AND A BLACK HOLE IN THE FINANCES THE REMAIN CAMP HAS DISMISSED THE CLAIMS POINTING OUT THE U.K. HAS A VETO ON BUDGET INCREASES
THE PRIME MINISTER THIS MORNING RISK FURTHER INFLAMING TENSIONS WITHIN HIS PARTY BY JOINING LEADING OPPOSITION FIGURES TO ATTACK BELIEVE CAMPAIGN HE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THE ACRIMONY BETWEEN THE RIVAL TORY CAMPS IN THIS REFERENDUM SEEMS TO DEEPEN DAY BY DAY TODAY CLAIMS BY THE BRICKS AT SIDE THAT BRITAIN WILL BE LIABLE FOR BILLIONS OF POUNDS' WORTH OF EXTRA PAYMENTS TO BRUSSELS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISMISSED AS LIES UNTRUTHS AND DECEITFUL BY SENIOR FIGURES IN THE REMAIN CAMP
THIS FOLLOWS A WARNING BY BORIS JOHNSON THAT THE U.K. WILL BE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE Y. YOU BAIL OUTS FOR COUNTRIES LIKE GREECE AND TO A LOOMING INCREASE IN THE E.U. BUDGET
THIS DESPITE THE FACT MISTER CAMERON NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT IN FEBRUARY TO EXCLUDE BRITAIN FROM ANY BAIL OUTS AND THE FACT THAT YOU KAY HAS A VETO OVER ANY FUTURE BUDGET INCREASES LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS COUNTER THAT SUCH SAFEGUARDS ARE NOT CREDIBLE
MEANWHILE TORY BRECHT'S AT CAMPAIGNERS HAVE BEEN ANGERED BY MISTER CAMERON'S DECISION TO APPEAR ALONGSIDE SENIOR OPPOSITION POLITICIANS INCLUDING LABOUR'S HARRIET HARMAN AND THE LEADERS OF THE LIB DEMS AND THE GREEN PARTY TO ACCUSE THE LEAVE CAMP OF A CON TRICK AGAINST VOTERS FOR FAILING TO SET OUT THEIR ECONOMIC ALTERNATIVE TO MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U.
THE B.B.C. HAS LEARNED THAT IF THERE'S A BOAT IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE E.U. SOME PRO REMAIN M.P.S WERE CONSIDER USING THEIR MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT TO KEEP BRITAIN IN SIGHT THE SINGLE MARKET THEY SAY THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS WOULD OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGE OF HAVING TO KEEP THE U.K.'S BORDERS OPENED TO E.U. WORKERS OUR CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE REPORTS
IF PEOPLE VOTE FOR BRICKS IT WHAT KIND OF TRADING RELATIONSHIP MIGHT BRITAIN HAVE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION MANY PRO LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS WANT TO LOOSE FREE TRADE AGREEMENT BUT PRU REMAIN M.P.S CLAIM THIS WOULD DAMAGE THE ECONOMY BECAUSE THERE'LL BE MORE BARRIERS TO TRADE THAN NOW
SO A NUMBER OF THEM TORY LABOUR AN S.N.P. HAVE TOLD ME THEY WOULD USE THEIR OVERWHELMING MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO TRY TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO KEEP BRITAIN INSIDE THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET ONE MINISTER SPOKE OF A REVERSE MAASTRICHT REFERENCE TO THE BLOODY TORY BATTLES OVER EUROPE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES
STAYING IN THE SINGLE MARKET THEY WOULD COME AT A PRICE BRITAIN WOULD HAVE TO KEEP ITS BORDERS OPENED TO E.U. WORKERS DESPITE HAVING VOTED TO LEAVE IN PART TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION
LEAVE SPOKESMAN SAID M.P.S WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DEFY THE WILL OF THE ELECTORATE AND A BRITAIN OUTSIDE THE E.U. WOULD TAKE CONTROL OF ITS BORDERS AND ECONOMY
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T REGISTERED TO TAKE PART IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM ON JUNE THE TWENTIETH OUT OF BEING URGED TO DO SO BEFORE THE DEADLINE TOMORROW IT'S ESTIMATED SIX MILLION POTENTIAL VOTERS AREN'T SIGNED UP TO RECEIVE A BALLOT PAPER HERE'S RICHARD SLEE
MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE IN LAST YEAR'S GENERAL ELECTION WILL THIS YEAR'S LOCAL ELECTIONS IN MAY WILL ALREADY BE REGISTERED TO VOTE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM HOWEVER IF YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED FOR EXAMPLE YOU'VE RECENTLY MOVED HOME THEN YOU WILL NEED TO RE REGISTER AT YOUR NEW PROPERTY IF YOU'RE NOT SURE IF YOU'RE REGISTERED THE ADVICE IS TO CONTACT YOUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES ELECTORAL REGISTRATION OFFICE
THOSE WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR A POSTAL VOTE MUST SEND IT TO THEIR LOCAL ELECTORAL REGISTRATION OFFICE TO ARRIVE BY FIVE P.M. TOMORROW
SCIENTISTS IN CALIFORNIA AND USING A CONTROVERSIAL TECHNIQUE TO CREATE HUMAN ORGANS BY GROWING THEM INSIDE PIGS THEY'VE INJECTED HUMAN STEM CELLS INTO PIG EMBRYOS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS CREATING A HUMAN PANCREAS SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE ANIMALS COULD PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO THE GLOBAL SHORTAGE OF HUMAN ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT BUT OTHERS HAVE RAISED ETHICAL CONCERNS OUR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT FOCUS WASH HAS THE STORY
THE SOUNDS YOU CAN HEAR A PREGNANT WITH EMBRYOS WHICH ARE PART PIG PART HUMAN WHAT ARE KNOWN AS CHIMERAS SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS JEAN EDITED THE PIG EMBRYOS TO REMOVE THE D.N.A. INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE A PANCREAS THEN THEY INJECTED HUMAN STEM CELLS IN THE HOPE THAT THESE WILL FILL THE GENETIC VOID AND GROW A HUMAN PANCREAS INSTEAD
THE SAME TECHNIQUE MIGHT ENABLE OTHER ORGANS TO BE GROWN FOR TRANSPLANT IF CELLS WERE TAKEN FROM PATIENTS THEN THE RESULTING ORGANS COULD BE TISSUE MATCHED TO PREVENT REJECTION
BUT THE RESEARCH IS CONTROVERSIAL THE MAIN U.S. MEDICAL RESEARCH AGENCY HAS REFUSED TO FUND CHIMERA EXPERIMENTS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS THAT PATIENT CELLS MIGHT MIGRATE TO THE PIGS DEVELOPING BRAIN AND MAKE IT MORE HUMAN
NONE OF THE U.S. TEAMS DOING THIS RESEARCH SAY THEY WILL ALLOW PIG HUMAN FOETUSES TO BE BORN UNTIL SUCH CONCERNS ARE RESOLVED AND YOU CAN SEE MORE ON THIS ON PANORAMA TONIGHT AT EIGHT THIRTY ON B. B. C. ONE
HELLO MUCK STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT TAKING HORMONAL DRUGS FOR UP TO TEN YEARS CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF BREAST CANCERS RETURNING BY A THIRD THE U.S. AND CANADIAN STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT ON NEARLY TWO THOUSAND POST MENOPAUSAL WOMEN THEIR FINDINGS COULD AFFECT THE TREATMENT OF MILLIONS OF WOMEN PROFESSOR DAME BATTERY BARREL THE DIRECTOR OF THE CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY UNIT AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY TOLD US THERE WERE SIDE EFFECTS BUT MOST WOMEN COULD MANAGE WITH THEM
THE MAIN THING IS ON HORMONES OESTROGENS ARE VERY GOOD FOR THE BONES AND WITH WITH THESE THERAPIES THAT BLOCK THE PRODUCTION OF OESTROGEN THE BONES ARE THINNER THAN I WOULD BE OTHERWISE AND THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK OF FRACTURE BUT THEY'RE VERY MINE IN THIS TRIAL THERE WERE VERY FEW SERIOUS FRACTURES LIKE EFFECT
THESE THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AND NINE HAVE BEEN INJURED SOME CRITICALLY IN A TRAIN CRASH IN EASTERN BELGIUM TWO TRAINS COLLIDED ON THE SAME SECTION OF TRACK WESTERBY AGE FROM BRUSSELS HE'S NICK BEAK

RESEARCHERS FROM CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY SAY ANXIETY IS A SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM WHICH NEEDS SPA GREATER ATTENTION THEY'RE WORKERS CONFIRMED THAT WOMEN PEOPLE AGED UNDER THIRTY FIVE THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY EXCESSIVE WORRY HE'S A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DREW
THESE RESEARCHERS EXAMINED FORTY EIGHT REVIEWS OF STUDIES INTO ANXIETY WHICH WERE CARRIED OUT AROUND THE WORLD SOME OF THEM IN THE U.K. PUBLISHING THEIR FINDINGS IN THE JOURNAL BRAIN AND BEHAVIOUR THEY FOUND THE OVERALL PROPORTION OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY ANXIETY REMAINED LARGELY UNCHANGED DURING THE PAST TWO DECADES BUT THE RESEARCHER SAID WOMEN WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY ANXIETY AS MEN AND YOUNGER MEN AND WOMEN WERE ALSO MORE PRONE TO SYMPTOMS SUCH AS PANIC ATTACKS
OR FEELINGS OF UNSHAKEABLE DREAD THE LEAD AUTHOR FROM CAMBRIDGE SUGGESTED THAT HORMONAL FLUCTUATIONS AND DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN CHEMISTRY COULD EXPLAIN THE HIGHER RATES AMONG WOMEN THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS SAID ONLINE TOOLS COULD HELP SUFFERERS SPOT PROBLEMS AND OFTEN THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM SIMPLE LIFESTYLE CHANGES
A VETERAN LOYALIST IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS DUE TO APPEAR IN COURT THIS MORNING CHARGED WITH MURDERING TWO CATHOLIC WORKMEN IN BELFAST IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND NINETEEN NINETY ONE WINSTONE RAY WHO'S SIXTY PIPE WAS ARRESTED AFTER POLICE GAINED ACCESS TO INTERVIEW SICK RECORDED WITH AMERICAN RESEARCHERS ARE AN ORAL HISTORY PROJECT

TASMANIA IS NOW RECEIVING THE WORST OF THE WEATHER WITH FLOOD WARNINGS ACROSS THE ISLAND FOR OF ACTUATION CENTRES HAVE BEEN SET UP AND HUNDREDS OF ROADS HAVE BEEN CLOSED
JOHN DONALDSON REPORTING THE TIME TEN PAST EIGHT WHEN WE DO THINGS THAT MATTER IN MEDICINE WHEN WE PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE WE OFTEN COME UP AGAINST ETHICAL QUESTIONS THINGS THAT MAKE US FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE THE IDEA OF GROWING ORGANS IN PIGS IS ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS IN AN EDITION OF PANORAMA THIS EVENING RESEARCH IN AMERICA IS GOING TO BE HIGHLIGHTED
WHICH INVOLVES INJECTING HUMAN STEM CELLS INTO PIG EMBRYOS THE IDEA THAT ONE DAY YOU COULD GROW HUMAN ORGANS INSIDE PIGS AND BECAUSE THE CELLS WERE TAKEN FROM A HUMAN PATIENT THERE WOULD BE NO RISK OF REJECTION WHEN THE ORGAN WAS TRANSPLANTED PETER STEPHENSON IS FROM COMPASSION IN WORLD FARMING I'VE BEEN TALKING TO HIM AND TO PROFESSOR SIR JOHN BYRNE WHO'S PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL GENETICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE AND HE STARTED BY TELLING ME ABOUT THE SCIENCE INVOLVED
I THINK THIS RESEARCH COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE CLEARLY HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH HAVING AVAILABLE TISSUE FOR TRANSPLANTATION AND THE IDEA THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY PRODUCE TISSUES THAT ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FROM DOMESTIC ANIMALS
CLEARLY OPENS UP A MUCH WIDER POSSIBILITY FOR TREATING PATIENTS REQUIRING KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS PEOPLE WITH DIABETES IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE PANCREAS IS A MAJOR FOCUS OF THEIR INTEREST SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WORK AND HOW WORRIED WOULD YOU BE ABOUT THINGS POTENTIALLY THAT MIGHT GO WRONG
I THINK ALL OF US SORT OF RECOILED SLIGHTLY AT THE FIRST THOUGHT OF THIS AND YOU HAVE TO START EXAMINING THE POSSIBLE RISKS I THINK SAFETY IS OBVIOUSLY PARAMOUNT AND WE'VE LEARNT AN AWFUL LOT IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WITH THE LIKES OF MAD COW DISEASE TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYTHING THAT IS PUT INTO HUMANS IS RIGOUROUSLY TESTED I THINK WE CAN TRUST THE EXISTING AUTHORITIES ON THAT
I THINK THE SECOND WORRY IS ABOUT THE WHAT THIS MEANS FOR ANIMAL CARE AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED THROUGH MY RESEARCH CAREER WITH COLLEAGUES DOING ANIMAL RESEARCH AND I THINK AGAIN WE CAN BE CONFIDENT IN THE VETERINARY PROTECTION I THINK THE THIRD AREA IS
JUST WHAT THIS MEANS FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP TO MAMMALS THAT JUST REMINDS US THAT WE ARE MAMMALS LIKE THEM AND WHETHER IT'S REASONABLE TO USE MAMMALS AS A SOURCE OF TISSUE BUT OF COURSE WE USE IT AS A SORT OF BREAKFAST BACON SO I THINK THAT'S A MORE QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOUR THAN USING ANIMALS FOR THIS PURPOSE DOES THAT ARGUMENT CONVINCE YOU PETER STEPHENSON
NOT ENTIRELY LOOK I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE LONGING OF ILL PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR TRANSPLANT ORGANS BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OPENING
A NEW SOURCE OF ANIMALS SUFFERING IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HUMAN ORGANS BY CHANGING THE LAW SO IT'S PRESUMED PEOPLE CONSENT TO THE USE OF THEIR ORGANS UNLESS THEY OPT OUT THAT'S THE LOIN WALES IT'S WHAT THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WANTS
AND HUMAN ORGANS ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO BE REJECTED WHEN TRANSPLANTED THAN THOSE FROM PIGS JEAN EDITED TO BE MORE HUMAN LIKE SO THERE'S A BETTER AND SIMPLER WAY IS THAT TRUE SIR JOHN THERE IS A BETTER AND SIMPLER WAY IF ONLY WE COULD PERSUADE MORE PEOPLE TO DONATE ORGANS
I THINK IT HEARD THERE IS TRUTH DID THAT I'M CERTAINLY WITH PETER IN SAYING THAT WE SHOULD BE FAR MORE RELAXED ABOUT HOW WE WE HAD A CHOIR OR I THINK MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT DEVELOPMENT BUT I THINK FOR EXAMPLE THE PANCREAS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET FROM AS A DAUGHTER TO SUE BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT'S FULL OF ENZYMES WHICH WILL RAPIDLY DESTROY IT SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE AREAS LIKE TREATING DIABETICS WHERE THAT APPROACHES IS PROBLEMATIC AND THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT
I DON'T SEE THESE AS EITHER OR I THINK THESE ARE COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES GROWING OR TISSUES IT ANIMALS WILL BE EXPENSIVE AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT IT IS ONLY IS IS TAKEN UP IN A MAJORITY OF CASES I DON'T ENVISAGE VAST FARMS OF ANIMALS BEING USED FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT IT'S ALSO IT IS THE CASE IS THE PROFESSOR OR SAME PISSED IT WAS WHO WE ALREADY GROW PIGS FOR BACON AND WE GROW THEM TO EAT THEM SO WHY WHY IS THIS MORALLY ETHICALLY DIFFERENT IT'S TO DO WITH THE
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS THAT THAT WE USE FIRST WHAT WE MUST DO IS TRY AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HUMAN DO NOUGHTS IF THEIR THERE'S STILL A SHORTAGE AND SOCIETY DECIDES
TO USE PIGS THEN WE MUST ENSURE THERE'S NO INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS USED FOR HUMAN PURPOSES AND THAT SIMPLY MEANS IN THE CASE OF PEAKS AT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EAT LESS MEAT IT'S MORALLY
VITAL BUT THERE'S NO INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS THAT SUFFER BITUMEN HAPPENS IT'S SIR JOHN WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED BY PEOPLE WHO OBJECT TO WHAT'S BEING DONE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S THE THE SUGGESTION THAT THE PIGS MIGHT COME MIGHT BECOME
IN A SENSE SLIGHTLY HUMAN THAT ACTUALLY THERE ISN'T THE CELLS INJECTED INTO THEM MIGHT TRANSFER TO THEIR BRAINS AND WE MIGHT BE DEALING WITH A LIVING THING THAT IS AT LEAST IN PART HUMAN IS IS THAT A REALISTIC AND A PROPER CONCERNED TO HAVE
I THINK IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE CONCERN I THINK IT PROBABLY UNDERESTIMATES THE COMPLEXITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE IDEA THAT A FEW STEM CELLS GET TANGLED UP WITH SOME PIG CELLS IN THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IS A LONG WAY AWAY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS BUT I THINK IT DOES REMIND US THAT IN FACT
ANIMALS A COG DISTANT OF THEIR SUFFERING AND SO I'M I'M WITH PETER IN IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS IN THIS WAY BUT I THINK THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH SOMETHING FROM HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY WERE THE PIGS ADVISE YOU KNOW WHICH PART TO EAT
IS REALLY A LONG LONG WAY AWAY IF EFFORT AND INDEED I THINK WATCH WE'VE GOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT WE'D WORK OUT WAYS OF GROWING THESE TISSUES IN BATS A LABORATORY RATHER THAN ACTUALLY IN ANIMALS WHICH WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY DESIRABLE FROM FROM EVERY RESPECTS HE PISSED IN SUCH AS WONDER OF ALL OF THESE CONCERNS ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE ARE INITIALLY AND PEOPLE HAD ENORMOUS CONCERNS ABOUT IN TRES FERTILISATION AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER AREAS
HUMAN BEINGS ARE MAKING PROGRESS BUT IN A WAY THAT THEY COULDN'T IN THE PASTON ETHICAL ISSUES ARE RAISED I JUST WONDER WHETHER THIS IS ANOTHER OF THOSE ACTUALLY IN THAT EVENTUALLY WE GET USED TO THE IDEA
NO I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WILL KATE USED TO THE IDEA BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A GROWING RECOGNITION THAT WE HAVE A CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITY TO ANIMALS THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE TREATING THEM AS A VIV'S BEEN PLACED IN THE WORLD JUST FOR OUR CONVENIENCE AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO TRY AND USE EVERY OTHER WAY OF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE THAN THAN THAN USING ANIMALS THE LAW IN A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAS ALREADY BEEN CHANGED SO JUST PRESUMED PEOPLE CONSENT TO THE USE OF THEIR ORGANS UNLESS THEY OPT OUT
AND IN BELGIUM FOR EXAMPLE THIS LED TO A DOUBLING IN THE NOW THE AMOUNT OF HUMAN ORGANS AVAILABLE WITHIN THREE YEARS STUDIES ARE ESTIMATING THAT IF WE CHANGE THE LAW IN IN ENGLAND THAT COULD LEAD TO TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY PER CENT INCREASE IN HUMAN ORGANS THERE ARE SIMPLER BETTER SOLUTIONS STEVENSON AND SIR JOHN BYRNE AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH AND JUST TO SAY MORE THAN THAT ON PANORAMA IT'S TONIGHT AT EIGHT THIRTY ON B. B. C.
SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT DO YOU EVER FEEL ANXIOUS OF COURSE YOU DO WE ALL DO BUT PEOPLE WHO SUFFER ANXIETY ATTACKS I'M NOT MERELY VERY WORRIED THEY CAN OFTEN HAVE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS RACING HEART TROUBLE BREATHING THEY CAN FIND IT INCREDIBLY HARD TO CONCENTRATE THEY OFTEN HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLE TO AVOID THE THINGS THAT CAUSE THEM THE ANXIETY IN THE FIRST PLACE A STUDY RELEASED TODAY BY CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY ANSWERS AS TO FOCUS MORE ON ANXIETY AS A HEALTH CONDITION
PARTICULARLY AMONGST WOMEN PARTICULARLY AMONGST THE YOUNG WERE JOINED ON THE LINE FROM DUNSTABLE BY HAMMER CARA SHE'S TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND HE'S SUFFERED PHYSICAL SIDE EFFECTS FROM SOCIAL ANXIETY LAWFORD ALSO BY OLIVIA REIMS IS A P.H.D. RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE WHO CARRIED OUT THIS PARTICULAR SET OF RESEARCH GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU
GOOD MORNING ANNA FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON TO TELL US ABOUT THIS CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO PEOPLE WHO MAY THINK ANXIETY ATTACKS HE'S JUST FEELING A BIT WORRIED BUT THAT IS LIFE IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH HOW IS IT FOR YOU HOW BAD CAN IT BE
IT'S A DIFFICULT THINKING I'D LIKE A CAN LIKE SO MANY FEELINGS CAN ARISE FROM MET LIKE FEELING BLOWN ME ISOLATED AS WELL AS HIS MENTAL FILLINGS THERE'S ALSO PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS FILLING VERY HEART NOR SHARES IT'S LIKE HE THOUGHT IT OR CAN GET A LOT
AND THEN YOUR CASE IS IT TRIGGERED BY A SPECIFIC SITUATION THERE IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU ANXIOUS OR RESIDENT JUST MUCH MORE GENERAL REACTION TO LIFE ERM MIND STARTED OFF LIKE EM VERY BUSY PLACE HERSELF FIND IT HARD TO BE AROUND IN CROWDED PLACES WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
AND IS THERE SOMETHING IN YOUR MIND AT THE TIME THAT THINGS THEY SAW THAT MIGHT HAPPEN THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WAS IT JUST A FEELING THAT YOU HAD
IS IT'S A FEELING THAT JUST COMES ABOUT LIKE I JUST FEEL ON EASY LIKE NOTHING REALLY TRIGGERS IT IS IT'S JUST WHEN THERE'S PEOPLE WE FEEL LIKE OH YOU CAN FEEL THE SENSATIONS OF THE PANIC STARTED TO RISE AND IF YOU HAD TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE IN ORDER TO AVOID THOSE SORTS OF SITUATIONS
YEAH LIKE WHEN I FIRST HAD I AVOIDED A LOT OF THINGS SAY I USED TO HAVE TWO I USED TO BOOK TAXIS TO GO HOME RATHER THAN TAKE THE BUS TO COS I WAS SO SCARED TO GET ON THE BUS BUT AGAIN NOT SCARED OF A SPECIFIC THING HAPPENING TO YOU JUST YOU KNEW THAT YOUR BODY YOUR MIND WOULD HAVE A PARTICULAR REACTION TO THAT SITUATION YEAH
THEN WE BRING IN OLIVIA REIMS THEN HE'S BEEN DOING THE RESEARCH INTO THIS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE IS THAT'S A DESCRIPTION OF A VERY COMMON PHENOMENON OVER DEFINITELY SO IT'S IT'S PERTH IT'S A CERTAIN SET OF SYMPTOMS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING AND TO ME IT SOUNDS VERY MUCH LIKE A GRAND PHOBIA WHICH IS A COMMON ANXIETY DISORDER SO PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO BE OUT IN THE OPEN SPACES
BECAUSE OF THAT THEY TURNED TO RESTRICT THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY DO AND THEY TEND TO STAY INDOORS AND MORE AND MORE SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY EXPERIENCE AND IT MAKES LIFE VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM LESS LIKELY TO FOR EXAMPLE SO IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THEY CAN LEAD TO
IMPAIRMENT AT WORK IMPAIRMENT IN SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE EXPOSED TO FEWER PEOPLE THEN THERE IS THE LESS LIKELY FOR INTERACTIONS AND FOR A MEANING FOR SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS TO DEVELOP SO THERE ARE SEVERAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS ENDING REVIEWING OTHER RESEARCH INTO THIS GLOBALLY WHY IS IT MUCH MORE COMMON DO WE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION MORE COMMON AMONGST WOMEN ARE MORE COMMON AMONGST YOUNG PEOPLE
SO THE PRECISE ANSWER IS NOT KNOWN BUT HE MIGHT BE MORE COMMON AMONG WOMEN BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN CHEMISTRY AND A WOMAN FLUCTUATIONS SO BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES COULD BE ONE ANSWER BUT ALSO WOMEN IN GENERAL MAYBE MORE PRONE TO STRESS THAN MEN AND THIS STRESS
SEEMS TO MANIFEST DIFFERENTLY AND WOMEN IT'S ROOM IT'S IT SEEMS TO INTERNALISE SO WOMEN WERE EXPOSED TO STRESS MAYBE MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP ANXIETY WHEREAS MEN WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED TO STRESS THEY MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP ALCOHOL ABUSE
AND ALSO WHEN EXPOSED TO STRESSORS WOMEN AND MEN TEND TO USE DIFFERENT COPING STRATEGIES SO WOMEN FOR EXAMPLE TENDS TO HAVE MORE EMOTION FOCUSED COPING THEY TEND TO RUM AND ATE A LOT ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND THERE GOES THROUGH THEIR MINDS A LOT THAT'S MARS V. VENOUS CLICHE ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN
OH RIGHT SO THESE COULD BE SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE O.K. SO DO YOU BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD I WANT TO BRING OLIVIA BACK IN
SO YOUNGER PEOPLE SO THERE THEY SEEM TO BE MORE AFFECTED BY ANXIETY THAN OLDER PEOPLE IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITIONS THERE WERE USING TO MEASURE ANXIETY DISORDERS ANXIETY AND OLDER PEOPLE MAY BE EXPERIENCED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY THEY MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS LIKE DIZZINESS SHAKINESS N. NOW RATHER THAN HAVING WORRYING BUT THAT'S OF WORRYING FOR EXAMPLE IS MORE PROMINENT IN YOUNGER PEOPLE
THE MERE THAT'S A HAND JUST ASK ABOUT HOW SHE'S NOW DEALING WITH IT WE KNOW THE NEGATIVE THINGS YOU'VE HAD TO DO AN A IN TERMS OF COPING WHAT'S ON THE MORE POSITIVE SIDE HAVE YOU FOUND HAS HELPED YOU
AS JUST SUPPORT FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT REALLY HELPED BUT ALSO THERAPY YEAH DEFINITELY SO I TOOK C.B.T. AND I'VE HAD COUNSELLING AND THAT'S HELPED ME SO MUCH MORE TO THE CIRCLE TALKING VERITY'S CALLED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY
AND HOW DOES THAT HELP DOES IT TAKE YOU THROUGH THE SITUATIONS IS IT ABOUT GETTING YOU TO RE LIVE SITUATIONS IN WHICH YOU MIGHT FEEL ANXIOUS SO THAT YOU CAN COPE WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE SO INCY B.T. THEY HAVE SOMETHING I THINK IT'S CALLED EXPOSURE THERAPY AND YOU TAKE YOU DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE NOT REALLY THAT MAKE YOU FEEL ANXIOUS AND YOU KIND OF WRITE A DIARY ABOUT IT SIR LIKE I KNEW WHAT YOUR SIM TURNS AND
EACH TIME YOU DO IT MAKES IT BETTER FOR YOU LIKE AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF OH THAT SITUATION WASN'T AS BAD AS I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE AND IT HELPS YOU GOOD WELL YOU JUST DEALT WITH THE ANXIETY BEING LIVE ON NATIONAL RADIO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DOING THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOU SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES HOPED IF I ME AND A CAR AND OLIVIA REIMS THANK YOU TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM ON WHETHER TO REMAIN A PART OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE
THE GOVERNMENT ALSO ATTEMPTED TO RENEGOTIATE THE TERMS OF OUR MEMBERSHIP AND PART OF THAT RENEGOTIATION INVOLVES SECURING SOME MINOR PROTECTION FOR NEW ZEALAND BUTTER WHICH WERE IMPORTED QUITE A LOT OF AT THE TIME THERE WAS MUCH CONSTERNATION AT THE IMPACT THAT MEMBERSHIP HAD ON THE COST OF A BUTTER AND SO IT'S LESS THAT WE'VE CHOSEN AS THEIR NEXT TO A SERIES OF REPORTS ON THE E.U. AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR DAILY LIVES HERE IS MATTHEW PRICE
BUTTER ON TOAST A SIMPLE PLEASURE BUT ONE THAT'S BEEN AFFECTED BY THE COMPLEXITIES OF A MEMBERSHIP OR BOTTLES THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY AND WHAT IS THAT
WHEN WE FIRST ANNOUNCED THAT WE WANTED TO JOIN THE B.B.C. BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE
WE WERE STILL IMPORTING MOST OF OUR AT LOW COST FROM NEW ZEALAND WE HAD PREFERENTIAL TRADING RULES WITH THE COMMONWEALTH BUT ONE OF THE TERMS OF MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.E.C. WAS THAT WE HAD TO END THAT PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY WHICH AIMED TO PROTECT EUROPEAN FARMERS WE DID A DEAL TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE IMPORTING SOME OF THE CHEAP NEW ZEALAND BUTTER
BUT OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.E.C. BACK THEN STILL PUSHED UP THE COST OF THIS BRITISH STAPLE
DOWN ON OUR FARMS AMONG THE DAIRY PRODUCERS THEY KNOW ALL TOO WELL ABOUT THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY IT'S ONE OF THE CENTRAL PILLARS UPON WHICH EUROPE'S INTEGRATION HAS BEEN BUILT OVER THE LAST SIXTY YEARS IT WAS CREATED TO MAKE EUROPE SELF SUFFICIENT IN FOOD AND TO SUPPORT EUROPEAN FARMERS
WI FI ARMING OR ARE CLAIMING ON ABOUT SIXTY HECTARES OF LAND HOLDING
THIS IS ANDREW COUSINS WHO AS A DAIRY FARMER IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS HAS FOLLOWED EVERY TWIST AND TURN OF THE C.A.P. HE'S NEEDED TO TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR HIS ANNUAL SUBSIDY NO PAYMENT TO ME IS AROUND ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND WOULD YOU SURVIVE WITHOUT NO WAY
BRITISH FARMERS RECEIVED ABOUT TWO AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS IN FARM SUBSIDIES THROUGH THE C.A.P. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IT MAKES UP ABOUT HALF OF U.K. FARMING INCOME AND WITHOUT IT MANY WOULD NO LONGER BE IN BUSINESS
EACH YEAR BRITAIN CONTRIBUTES ABOUT TWICE THAT AMOUNT TO THE C.A.P. AS PART OF OUR E.U. CONTRIBUTIONS I THINK THE MAIN IMPACT I DO REMEMBER IS THE IMPOSITION OF MILK QUOTAS IN I THINK IT WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
THAT HAD QUITE AN EFFECT ON THE WHOLE OF THE DAIRY HISTORY PUSH DOWN THE AMOUNT OF MILK THAT YOU WERE ALLOWED TO PRODUCE YES SICK PUT A LIMIT ON IT BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO MUCH MILK BEING PRODUCED
THE TERM THAT GOT COINED AT THAT TIME WAS A BETTER NAMED HIM FOR YEARS THE SUBSIDIES ENCOURAGED FARMERS TO PRODUCE MORE THAN WAS NEEDED THE RESULTING MOUNTAINS OF BUTTER MADE THE C.A.P. A BYWORD FOR Y. Y. YOU WASTE THE SYSTEM HAS SINCE BEEN REFORMED I WOULD DESCRIBE IT MORE AS A MOLEHILL THESE DAYS
HERE'S WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT AN INCH OF A. FOUR PAPER
WHICH IS JET TO GET THE PAYMENTS FARMERS HAVE TO MEET ENVIRONMENTAL ANIMAL WELFARE FOOD SAFETY AND TRACEABILITY STANDARDS ON ENTRY COUSINS DESK IS A LARGE MASS OF E.U. PAPERWORK TO GO THROUGH THIS IF I GET THE LIST OF CROP COZ THIS IS GENERATED BY EUROPE IT DOES EVERYTHING FROM GRASS WE GROW IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE DOWN TO WARN US THAT YOU'RE GROWING GRACE
I'VE GOT PAGES OF COLDS TO GO THROUGH BUT LUCKILY ONCE I'VE SORTED OUT WHAT THIS FARMER'S I'D PROBABLY USE LATER TEN CODES FOR THE VARIOUS CROPS AND AREAS OF LAND WHICH ARE NON AGRICULTURAL USE
THE POLICIES STILL TAKES UP A HUGE AMOUNT OF THE SPENDING IT'S NOT SO LONG AGO THREE QUARTERS OF ALL THE E.U. BUDGET WENT TO FARMERS AND RURAL AREAS THAT'S DROPPED RECENTLY BUT THE C.A.P. STILL ACCOUNTS FOR ALMOST TWO FIFTHS OF THE ANNUAL E.U. BUDGET NOW THAT SOMETHING TO CHEW OVER
THAT'S YOUR PRICE TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST AIN'T I'M GARY'S HERE WITH A SCHOOL ANDY MURRAY IS GOING TO HAVE A REST AND TAKE STOCK AFTER TWO WEEKS OF TENNIS IN PARIS WHICH SAW HIM LOSE IN THE FINAL OF THE FRENCH OPEN TO NOVAK DJOKOVIC AT MURRAY'S CLEAR ALREADY ON ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE DIDN'T WIN

WHAT WE MUST REMEMBER OF COURSE IT WAS HIS TENTH GRAND SLAM FINAL HE'S ONE TOO IT'S AN ASTONISHING ACHIEVEMENT AND ONE THAT SHOULDN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED SAID A TEN ROUND FINAL THAT EQUALS YOU KNOW FRED PERRY THAT THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS TO ME YOU NEED TO GO WEE WE WERE CRYING OUT FOR SOMEONE TO GET THROUGH TO THE SECOND WEEK OF THE GRAND LAMP UNTIL WE HAD SOMEONE COMPLETE THESE AND COMPETING SO
O.K. ONE VERY QUICK ANSWER FROM YOU THE DAILY MAIL HAVE A GOOD HEADLINE THIS MORNING THEY SAY IT USED TO BE THE BIG FOR REFERENCE TO FEDERER DJOKOVIC AND MURRAY NOW THEY SAY IT'S THE BIG ONE AND THAT'S CORRECT ISN'T IT DJOKOVIC
SUE BARKER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TODAY'S BIG FOOTBALL STORY WILL CENTRE ON JAMIE VARTY THE LEICESTER STRIKER WANTED BY ARSENAL WABI IS DUE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO REMAIN WITH LESTER VIDE AND HIS TEAM MATES FLY TO FRANCE FOR THE EUROS WHALES HAVE LIMBERED UP AND NOT VERY WELL THEY LOST TO SWEDEN THREE NIL AND THE YOUNG SHEPHERD GOALKEEPER MARK FITZ PATRICK CONTINUES TO IMPRESS YOU WON THE SECOND EUROPEAN TOUR TITLE OF HIS CAREER RACING SELECTIONS BRIGHTON TO FORTY FIVE NUMBER FIVE SPIRIT OF ROSANNA
THREE FIFTEEN NUMBER TWO NIGEL GARY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO GO A LONG IN HALF AN HOUR OR SO IS ANDY MOORE OF COURSE WAS STOP WE COULD JOIN US NOW IN THE STUDIO TO TELL US MORE HI NICK WELL I HEARD YOU ALL WERE BLING ON ABOUT PIGS AND ORGANS AND MIRRORS EARLY ON WERE WORK ON CUE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE HELPFUL I'M GOING TO BE TALKING AT NINE THE AUTHOR OF AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT NEW BOOK ON GENETICS
DO YOU THINK THE BIOLOGY TODAY IS IN ROUGHLY THE SAME PLACE AS MOLECULAR PHYSICS WAS JUST BEFORE THE INVENTION OF THE ATOM BOMB SO WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT POST HUMANS AND MANY THINGS YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE JOINED BY A GUY WHO'S LOOKING AT THE GENETICS OF WHY THEY'RE ALSO FAT NOT YOU NOT ME OF COURSE BUT THE REST OF THEM TWO WRITERS WHO I THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO COCKY ABOUT MODERN MEDICINE WE SHOULD LOOK BACK TO OLDER STORIES AND THE KINDS OF MEDICINE WHICH CONTAIN THEIR WISDOM AS WELL SO FROM
BONE SETTERS TO TRANCE HUMANS START THE WEEK AT NIGHTS NOT THE WORK ON NINE O'CLOCK THANKS ERNIE THE WEATHER FOR MOST RATHER NICE ACTUALLY ISOLATED THUNDERY SHOWERS IN THE NORTH AND THE WEST BUT PRETTY FINE ELSEWHERE YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR JUSTIN WEBB AND NICK ROBINSON IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE CORRIE CORFIELD HAS A SUMMARY OF THE DAY'S NEWS
POLLUTING BREAKS IT CAMPAIGN BORIS JOHNSON HAS CLAIMED A VOTE TO STAY IN THE E.U. COULD MEAN BRITAIN HAS TO MAKE BILLIONS OF POUNDS AN EXTRA PAYMENTS TO THE EUROPEAN UNION HE WILL SAY LATER THAT THAT BIGGER BILL WOULD BE DUE TO BUDGET INCREASES SENT BRUSSELS FUTURE URINE SENT BAIL OUTS AND A TWENTY BILLION POUND BLACK HOLE IN THE E.U. FINANCES THE REMAIN SIDE HAS DISMISSED THE CLAIMS POINTING OUT THAT THE U.K. HAS A BEAT HER BUDGET INCREASES AND HAS NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT TO BE EXCLUDED FROM ANY EUROZONE BAILOUT
SCIENTISTS IN CALIFORNIA USING A CONTROVERSIAL TECHNIQUE TO CREATE HUMAN ORGANS BY GROWING THEM INSIDE PIGS SOME EXPERTS SAY IT COULD RELIEVE THE SHORTAGE OF HUMAN ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANTS BUT PETER STEPHENSON FROM COMPASSION IN WORLD FARMING US SAID IT WOULD BE SAFER TO CHANGE THE LAW SO THAT IT WAS ASSUMED THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD DONATE THEIR ORGANS IN EVERY CASE UNLESS THEY SPECIFICALLY OPTED OUT
AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A TRAIN CRASH IN EASTERN BELGIUM LOCAL OFFICIALS SAID A PASSENGER SERVICE CRASHED INTO THE BACK OF A STATIONARY COULD STRAIN THE LANDMARK STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT TAKING HORMONAL DRUGS FOR UP TO TEN YEARS CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF BREAST CANCERS RETURNING BY A THIRD BUT THE STUDY'S AUTHOR SAID IT INCREASE THE RISK OF OSTEOPOROSIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED KORRIS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE NOW LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE TO TAKE POWER AWAY FROM THE ELITES
HAND IT TO THE MASSES IT IS AFTER ALL TIME FOR A DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION THAT BELIEVE IT OR NOT IS WHAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MOST SIGNIFICANT DECISION TO BE TAKEN ABOUT THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE
FOR DECADES WILL NOT BE MADE BY THE RICH OR THE POWERFUL OR THE ESTABLISHMENT IT WILL BE MADE BY YOU BY THE PEOPLE EACH AND EVERYONE OF US HAVING A VOTE WHICH CARRIES PRECISELY THE SAME WEIGHT AS THAT OF THE PRIME MINISTERS
SO WHY IS THERE FOR MANY MORE OF A SENSE OF ENNUI THAN EXHILARATION IN A MOMENT I'LL BE SEEKING SOME COMMITMENTS FROM THE TWO CAMPAIGNS IN THIS REFERENDUM ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT MAKE THEIR NEXT TWO CRITICAL WEEKS JUST A TAD MORE UP LIFTING FIRST DAY LET'S HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE OF HARLOW IN ESSEX A REPORTER SIOBHAN TIE HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO PEOPLE THERE
I'M NOT REALLY TAKING ANY NOTICE OF IT TO BE FAIR I'M NINETEEN I'M INTERESTED IN I SHOULD BE BUT I JUST
IT'S NOT SO THE VOTERS IN TWO AND A HALF WEEKS ARE YOU GOING TO GET INTERESTED WE'LL HAVE TO SAY BUT I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK I WILL YOU CAN'T REALLY ESCAPE FROM IT IT'S EVERYWHERE IT HAS GOT TO THE POINT NOW WHERE IT'S
JUST BACKSTABBING ALL THE TIME WE'RE NOT REALLY BEING GIVEN THE FULL FACTS I SOMETIMES I WATCH POLITICAL PROGRAMMES ANDREW MARR THAT SORT OF THING
THAT SHE STARTED ACTIVELY AVOIDING IT NOW COS IT'S GETTING ON MY WICK COS THEY HAVE JUST GOT RIDICULOUS NOW IT'S JUST A BACKGROUND NOISE AND WE STILL GOT QUITE A FEW WEEKS TO GO NO I MEAN WE'VE RESEARCHED IT AND GOT OPINIONS ON BOTH SIDES LOOKED AT ALL THE DETAILS THAT WE MET THERE WE CAN GET HANDS ON AND I FEEL LIKE
GOT AS MUCH KNOWLEDGE AS WE CAN GET ANYWAY WHY ARE YOU TAKING IT AS SERIOUSLY AS YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE FOR OUR CHILD I MEAN IT'S GONNA AFFECT US BUT IT WILL IT SUITS HIS LIE MORE WORRIED ABOUT HIS FUTURE
BEEN WATCHING THE TELEVISION SO I'M JUST ABOUT TO MAKE UP MY MIND STILL UNDECIDED UNDECIDED BUT I'M THINKING I KNOW WHICH WAY I'M GOING TO GO IT'S QUITE YOUR FACE IS QUITE THERE
WITH THE DELIVERY OF THE INFORMATION I GUESS WHOSE TRUST BORIS JOHNSON OR THEY'VE CAMERA PITY TRUST I FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO GIVE A FAIR VOTE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT VOTE BUT IT'S A BAD THING TO SAY BUT THEY SHOULD VOTE THERE'S NOT REALLY ENOUGH PROPER INFORMATION
AROUND I'LL BE MORE INTERESTED TO HEAR FACTS RATHER THAN PEOPLE'S OPINIONS SO VERY CONFUSING IT AFFECTS ALL OF US IT'S GOING TO AFFECT OUR FUTURE SO WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT WE HAVE TO GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT AND TO YOU AT LEAST ENGAGE WITH THE DEBATES THAT
ME LISTENING TO THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVING A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT FOR A VERY LONG TIME WILL STRAW IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF BRITAIN STRONGER IN EUROPE STEVEN PARKINSON IS IN CHARGE OF THE GROUND CAMPAIGN FOR VOTE LEAVE LET'S JUST START WITH SOMETHING WHERE YOU MAY HAVE A SHARED VIEW
DO YOU AGREE THAT SOMETHING'S GOING WRONG OR WILL STRAW IS THIS JUST INEVITABLE IN A CAMPAIGN WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT USED TO VOTING ON AN ISSUE OF THIS SORT THEY'RE GRAPPLING TO GET TO GRIPS WITH IT I THINK THERE ARE PERHAPS TWO THINGS HERE THAT ARE WORTH REFLECTING ON IN THIS REFERENDUM THE FIRST IS THAT BROADCASTERS SUCH AS YOURSELF HAVE A DUTY TO PROVIDE BALANCE BUT THAT MEANS THAT YOU GET INSTANCES
WHERE A CAMPAIGN WE WOULD SAY THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN PUTTING UP THINGS THAT HAVE NO EXPERT BACKING AT ALL ARE PRESENTED AS AS FACT PRESENTED AS BEING SOMETHING THAT IS WORTHY OF A DEBATE WHEN ACTUALLY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT AND THAT HAS BEEN A FRUSTRATION I THINK ON OUR SIDE DO YOU THINK JUST BEFORE YOU CAUSE YOUR SECOND AS IT WERE THAT THE COMMITMENT TO BALANCE NOT JUST HERE AT THE B.B.C. BUT I.T.V. HABIT SKY HAVE IT THAT'S WHAT BROADCASTERS HAVE TO DO LEGALLY
IN A SENSE CONFUSES PEOPLE BECAUSE WE DON'T SAY THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT THE STORY THAT LED THE NEWS THIS MORNING THIS IDEA THAT WE WOULD PAY MORE TO SUPPORT THE EUROZONE WHICH HAS NO BASIS IN FACT THE PRIME MINISTER SECURED VITO BUT IT'S PRESENTED AS BEING SOMETHING THAT IS A LEGITIMATE CLAIM AND THEREFORE HE SCRUTINISED ROTTEN DISMISSED THIS GIVES JUSTIN THE CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND SECOND LET'S COME UP WITH YOUR SECOND WORRIES THAT THE SECOND POINT IS THAT THIS DEBATE HAS BEEN SEEN THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE INTERNAL ISSUES IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO DIVIDE IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
RATHER THAN LOOKING AT HOW THERE IS A WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE A COMING TOGETHER OF DIFFERENT PARTIES TRADE UNIONS BUSINESS DIFFERENT N.G.O.S SUPPORTING OUR SIDE OF THE ARDENT SO AGAIN THIS MORNING THAT B. B. C. LEAD ON THE SPLIT INSIDE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OVER THIS EUROZONE RATHER THAN THE FACT THAT TODAY YOU HAVE DAVID CAMERON TIM FARRON NATALIE BENNETT AND HARRIET HARMAN MAKING A JOINT STABLE BEFORE WE COME BACK ON THE SPECIFICS OF TODAY I WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO DO SO I ASKED HIM TO REFLECT WHAT YOU TO REFLECT
IS THERE A PROBLEM STEPHEN IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK IT'S A BIT RICH OF WILL TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE STORY'S BEEN DOMINATED BY SPLITS WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHEN IT WAS HIS CAMPAIGN WHO PUT THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER ON THE AIRWAVES YESTERDAY TO COLL TO CALL BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GAVE NAMES WE'VE GOT SEVENTEEN DAYS LEFT IN THIS REFERENDUM THERE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES AT STAKE WE COULD CONCENTRATE ON INTERNAL PARTY POLITICAL ROWS WE COULD CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON
WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT WE COULD DO WE VOTE LEAF AND THIS IS A CONTROL IT'S WEARING NOT CLEARLY A MOMENT FOR A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF SELF REFLECTION SO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE ROW THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE BOTH OF YOU CLEARLY WHICH IS ABOUT TODAY'S STORY SO STEVEN PARKINSON FROM VOTE LEAVE LET BEETLE
IT IS THE CASE WELL LET'S JUST ASK YOU WHETHER IT'S THE CASE HE IS IT THE CASE THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO PAY HIM TO ANY EUROZONE BAILOUT WELL YOU CAN SEE HOW THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS OVER RULED US AND HAS BROKEN ITS PROMISES ON BUT I'M AT THE VERY NARROW FACTUAL WITH BUT THEY DID KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO FORCE YOU I'M SORRY
ANSWER THE QUESTION IS IT THE CASE THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS SECURED AGREEMENT THAT IT IS NOT PART OF ANY EUROZONE BAILOUT ONLY A POLITICAL AGREEMENT ON ONE THAT THERE IS A GREAT CHANCE FOR THE CHECKER QUANTITY FLAGRANT BREACH WHEN THE E. THE E. YOU USE THE FINANCIAL STABILISATION MECHANISM TO MAKE US PAY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE CLEAR ABOUT YOUR POSITIONS FOR THAT FOR GREECE THERE IS AN AGREEMENT
BUT IT ISN'T ONE THAT YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE ONE HAS BEEN BROKEN THE PRIME THE CHANCELLOR HIMSELF HE SAID IS THEY FLAGRANT BREACH OF THAT PROMISE AND THE U.K. IS LIABLE TO FUTURE BAILOUT THE BIT ON OTHER FACT IS THERE EVERY BRITISH VETO ON THE SIZE OF THE E.U. BUDGET OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO OF THE TREATY ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE LETS THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS BY QUALIFIED MAJORITY VOTE
PAY AD HOC PAYMENTS TO MEMBER STATES FOR BUT FOR BAIL OUTS SO WE ALSO IN THERE IS NOT THEY'RE FACTUALLY THERE IS NOT A VETO YOU SAY OVER THE SIZE OF THE BUDGET IN FUTURE THREATS AND HONEST THIS BUT THAT'S ALL SHE WANTS RIGHT HE BASICALLY SAYS YES AS A POLITICAL AGREEMENT BUT THEY'LL BREAK IT THE COURTS MIGHT OVERRULE IT AND KNOW THERE ISN'T REALLY A VETO OVER THERE SO I THINK HE'D PUNCH I MEAN IT'S COMPLETELY WRONG THERE IS A POLITICAL AGREEMENT HAS LEGAL FORCE AND THERE IS A VETO IT IS VERY CLEAR AND DON'T TAKE IT FROM ME
TALK TO THE EXPERTS ABOUT THIS AS YOU SHOULD TALK TO THE EXPERTS ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC FINANCES WOULD BE IF WE LEFT MORE GENTLY COS THIS HAS BEEN A BIG ISSUE I'M SURE YOU WANT TO GET ON TO IT THERE IS A CLAIM THAT WE WOULD MAKE A SAVING IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND YET ALL THE EXPERTS WHETHER IT'S THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS OR THE INSTITUTE FISCAL STUDIES SAY NO THERE WOULD BE A MASSIVE HIT TO A PUBLIC FINANCES AGAIN MARTIN LEWIS THE RESPECT THERE'S A DISPUTE ABOUT YOUR FINGERS TAKE IT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH THAT LET LET ME JUST BE TRY AND GET SOME CONSENSUS
PEOPLE ARE BAFFLED WHEN THEY HEAR YOU HAVE THE SORT OF BOG ISN'T THE TRUTH IS THAT NEITHER SIDE ARE WILLING TO ADMIT UNCERTAINTY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CLAIMING YOU KNOW TODAY FOR FOLK BELIEVE STEPHEN PODS YOU FEAR IT YOU THINK THERE'S THINGS IN THE PAST THAT MIGHT SUGGEST IT WOULD HAPPEN YOU WANT TO WARN PEOPLE ABOUT YOUR WORRIES PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE YOU STATE AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN YOU SIMPLY DON'T KNOW THAT AN EQUALLY WELL STRAW
YOU SAY WE'LL PAY MORE IN THAT MORTGAGE PAYMENT YOU'VE NO IDEA WHAT OUR MORTGAGES WILL BE IN THREE MONTHS' TIME YOU PRESENT LACK OF CERTAINTY AS IF YOU HAVE
CAST IRON CERTAINTY BOTH OF YOU THERE'S A SIMPLE CHOICE FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE THEY CAN THEY CAN DECIDE WHETHER THEY TRUST DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE AND ALL THE POLITICIANS DOWN THE YEARS WHO HAVE MADE PROMISES AND BROKEN THEM WHO'VE SEEN PROMISES THAT WE WON'T PAY MORE MONEY HOW WE'VE PAID MORE AND MORE OR THEY CAN LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED THEY CAN LOOK AT THESE BREAKNECK AND THEY CAN DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS FROM IT SIGNALS A THANK YOU I THINK THE TIME HAS COME TO LISTEN TO EXPERTS IN THIS DEBATE I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION WITH THE TWO CAMPAIGN SO LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE EXPERTS ARE SAYING
MARTIN LEWIS TODAY WHO'S NOT CAMPAIGNING FOR EITHER SIDE SO ON BALANCE OF RISKS WE ARE LIKELY TO BE WORSE OFF IF WE STAY IN NINETEEN TEN ECONOMISTS AGREE WITH THAT WHAT THE LEAF CAMPAIGN HAVE NOT DONE IS SET OUT A PLAN THEY HAVE NO CLARITY ABOUT WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE FOR THE U.K. THEY HAVE UNFUNDED SPENDING CAMILLE TENT OF THE TEXT THAT INSTEAD I THINK IT'S THAT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD LISTEN TO
WITH STRAW WILL SEE IF THE LISTING IT WAS FROSTY POCKETS THANK YOU FOR COMING THANK YOU EIGHTY MINUTES TONIGHT A BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES FIGHTING ACTUALLY ON A FRONT LINE IN SYRIA THE TIMES IS REPORTING THIS MORNING THAT THEY ARE RELEASED THEY HAVE BEEN SARAH ELIZABETH WILLIAMS AS THE TIMES CORRESPONDENT IS AMAR IN AMMAN IN JORDAN AND SHE WROTE THE STORAGE IS ON THE LINE A GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU DISCOVER

GOOD MORNING JUST BEFORE WE GO TO THIS SUBJECT CAN I COMMEND TO PEOPLE THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH WITH THE COMMITTEE SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED ON A ROLE IN THE WORLD AND HAVE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR AN UNBIASED CECIL VERITY BECAUSE IT DISAPPEARED INTO A MEDIA AVOID PRECISELY WHEN DID IT COME OUT

WELL IF PEOPLE WANT TO FIND A PUBLIC SERVICE THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN GOOGLE IT PRESUMABLY TWENTY SIXTH APRIL WRAP FOREIGN AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE REPORT ON COMMITTEE RIGHT UNANIMOUSLY AGREED BY SUPPORTERS O.K. WELL PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING IT UP EVEN AS I SPEAK
LET'S TURN NOW TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN WELL NOT IN JORDAN ACTUALLY BUT IN SIRRAH IT SEEMS HOW CONCERNED WOULD YOU BE IF IT WERE TO BE CONFIRMED THAT BRITISH SOLDIERS ARE NOT IT SEEMS ACTUALLY FIRING WEAPONS IN SYRIA BUT CERTAINLY COMING UNDER FIRE
WELL I'M NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED AND I'M NOT AT ALL SURPRISED THIS KIND OF OPERATION HAS BEEN TO A DEGREE BRIEFED BY HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH OF JORDAN IT'S PART OF A SERIES OF OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE JORDANIAN WS AND THE JORDANIAN SUPPORTING
ELEMENTS OF THE FREE SYRIAN ARMY AND THIS APPEARS TO BE A SMALL SET OF OPERATIVES WHO
DESERTED FROM ASAD'S ON IT SOME TIME AGO AND GOT TRAINED UP BY THE AMERICANS AND OURSELVES THAT WE ARE UNDER THE RULES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE PARLIAMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO APPROVE SPECIAL WELL THEY WERE IN THIS ALICE IN WONDERLAND WORLD WHERE PARLIAMENT IS APPROVED APPROVED A MOTION SAYING NOTES THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT DEPLOY U.K. TROOPS IN GROUND COMBAT OPERATIONAL HERE WE ARE THIS IS THE MAN
DOESN'T SAY BRACKETS NOT SPECIAL FORCES BUT IT BUT THE CONVENTION IS THAT IT IS BRACKETS NOT SPECIAL FORCES WE DON'T WE DON'T COLLARS ON SPECIAL FORCES OPERATIONS AND IF YOU RUN AN OPERATION
A LONG TIME AS WE HAVE HERE AND IN LIBYA EVENTUALLY NEWSPAPERS LIKE THE TIMES REPORT IT AND THEN THE DEFENCE SECRETARY CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT YOU CAN'T HAVE A PROPER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THIS ACTUALLY FITS IN A WIDER ARC ET STRAT DOES THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT AND THERE WILL BE SOME WHO SAY SHOULDN'T JUST BE SPECIAL FORCES THERE SHOULD BE A WIDER COMBAT ROLE FOR BRITAIN AND THERE'LL BE SOME WHO SAY THERE ISN'T AN ACTUALLY THAT DECISION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN PARLIAMENT IF THERE'S TO BE ANY FIGHTING AT ALL DONE BY ANYONE IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO HAVE US
THESE ARE THE POINTS I MADE IN THE DEBATE WHEN WE APPROVED AIR STRIKES IN SYRIA I SAID THE GOVERNMENT'S MOTION WAS TOO NARROW IT ONLY REFER TO ICE SOUL YET THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL HAD ALSO PRESCRIBED AS BEING BEYOND THE PALE AND THEREFORE AN ENEMY OF THE WHOLE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND WE HAVEN'T GIVEN AUTHORITY FOR OUR FORCES AIR FORCES TO ATTACK ALMA'S ROOM WHY NOT
IT'S THE RUSSIANS ARE NOW REPORTING SIX THOUSAND ALMA'S WERE FORCES NORTH OF ALEPPO WE JUST DON'T HAVE A PROPER U.K. ROLE WITHIN A PROPER INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY THAT IS TOGETHER WITH THE RUSSIANS AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE EFFECTIVE ON THE ON THE GROUND ABOUT DEFEATING EYESORE AND ALNESS
CRISPIN BLUNT THE CHAIR OF THE FRONT OF A SELECT COMMITTEE HAS GONE AS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU IT IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE IT WAS STATE SPONSORED IT WAS SYSTEMATIC IT WAS ENDEMIC THE TRUE SCALE OF THE DOPING OF RUSSIAN ATHLETES IS SLOWLY BUT STEADILY BEING UNCOVERED TWENTY TWO RUSSIAN ATHLETES ARE NOW TESTED POSITIVE AFTER NEW TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON SAMPLES FROM THE LONDON AND BEIJING OLYMPICS THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF RUSSIA'S ANTI DOPING LABORATORY HAS CLAIMED THE F.S.B. WHAT WE SCORED K.G.B. WAS INVOLVED IN
COVERING UP DOPING AT THE SAATCHI WINTER OLYMPICS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TODAY RUSSIA'S ANNOUNCING A PROGRAMME IN SCHOOLS TO TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE TO PLAY FAIR I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE RUSSIAN ANTI DOPING AGENCY ANNA AND I ASKED HER WHY SHE THOUGHT IT WAS NECESSARY TO TEACH HER DIFFERENT ATTITUDE TO CHEATING
THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE ATTITUDE TO YOUR GENERAL PUBLIC TO YOU TOPPING TO CRAZIER OR COLOURINGS ARE SOCIETY EVENTS WHY WE WELCOME THE MINISTRY INITIATE HEAVE TO YOU PRETTY MANDATORY CLUSIUS ON ANTI DOPING IN ORDINARY SCHOOLS TOGETHER VISIT MINISTER OF SPORT AND THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION ABOUT PLANNING TO INTRODUCE SPECIAL ANTI DOPING LESSONS SPORTS SCHOOLS WE HAVE LIKE
THREE THOUSAND SCHOOLS ALL OVER RUSSIA WE ARE HOPING TO REACH ONE MILLION SPORTS YOUNG ATHLETES AND GIVE THEM IDEAS ARE DOCKING IT'S A CHEATING IT'S BAD TO TEASE THEM SPORTS REALLY YOU AS PRINCIPAL OF FAIR PLAY AND TO CREATE WHAT TURNS HIM ON
PEOPLE MAY GREET THIS VERY CYNICALLY OUTSIDE RUSSIA THEY MAY BENT SAY THAT AFTER MAYBE YEARS POSSIBLY DECADES OF DISHONESTY ORGANISED CHEATING CHEATING SUPPORTED BY THE STATE ITSELF WHY SHOULD ANYBODY BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA IS SERIOUS ABOUT CHANGE
IT'S WHY WE DECIDED TO START FROM THE EARLY AGED FROM THE YOUNG ASHLEY'S A CREATE NEW GENERATION OF ATHLETES THAT CAN MAY CRY DECISION AND THEY'D DO NOT TELL THE RATE DROPPING IN ANY FORM ISN'T THE CLEAREST WAY OF SAYING TO YOUNG PEOPLE IS WRONG TO BAN RUSSIAN ATHLETES FROM THE OLYMPIC GAMES SO THAT FOR THE REST OF TIME PEOPLE KNOW WHAT A VERY HIGH PRICE IS PAID IF YOU DO CHEAT
WE THINK THAT IT'S UNFAIR TO CLEAN OUR SLEEVES IT WILL BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHT ANTI COMPETE AT OLYMPICS WE CREATED
SYSTEM OF TESTING TO BE SIGNED AGREEMENT WAS YOU CARDS TO SHOW THE WARDS IT ON THE CLEAN RUSSIAN ATHLETES FROM GAUTIER OLYMPICS IS THIS WHY WE SEEING THE DOCKING IS NOT ONLY RUSSIA PROBLEM AND IT'S UNFAIR TO RATION CLEAN ASHLEY IT IS ONLY THEY WILL BE DEPRIVED THIS RIGHT RUSSIA IS STILL BANNED THERE ISN'T IT BY THE INTERNATIONAL ATHLETICS FEDERATION
ARE YOU HOPING THAT THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT WILL TAKE A DIFFERENT POSITION SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT RUSSIAN ATHLETES COULD COMPETE INDIVIDUALLY IF THEY WERE CLEAN BUT NOT UNDER UNDER THE FLAG AS THEY WOULD NORMALLY BE AT ME HOLD THAT CLEAN RUSSIANS RUSSIAN ASHLEY TO BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN OLYMPICS
BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR FOR THEM TO COMPETE TO BE PREPARED FOR FOUR YEARS AND FOR SOME OF THEM WHICH IS THE ONLY CHANCE TO COMPETE AND SHOW THEIR FRIENDS
NOW YOU ARE LOOKING TO THE FUTURE OF COURSE BUT YOU KNOW A PREDECESSOR OF YOURS MY WATCHING KEN GOLF HAS ACTUALLY SAID THAT THERE WAS ORGANISED CHEATING SUPPORTED BY RUSSIAN STATE OFFICIALS SUPPORTED BY RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE WHAT WE USED TO CALL THE K.G.B. IS THERE ANY SIGN OF THAT CHANGING
I JUST WANT TO STRESS IT RUSHING WITH THE HEAD OF THE LABORATORY THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO IN COMMON OF HIS RUSSIAN ANTI DOPING AGENCY OR RECITE IT IN OTHER SEPARATE ORGANISATION I CANNOT ANSWER OR THE ACTIVITY OF THE CIRCULATION DO YOU BELIEVE IT TOOK PLACE
I DON'T KNOW WE RECEIVED INFORMATION OF POSITIVE CASES SENT PROCEED OF HIS RESULTS MANAGEMENT AND PUNISHMENT OF WRESTLERS IT VIOLATED HUNTED OR PETER RULES WE NEVER FELL INTO OUR ACTIVITY
AREN'T THE PEOPLE YOU NEED TO RE EDUCATE NOT YOUNG PEOPLE NOT CHILDREN BUT PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY AT THE TOP OF RUSSIAN ATHLETICS AT THE TOP OF RUSSIAN SPORT WHO BELIEVE THAT WINNING MATTERS MORE
THE NOT CHEATING YES I THINK THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO CREATE ZERO TOLERANCE HAS MISSED HERE IN ALL RUSSIAN SOCIETY THAT'S WHY WE BOTH CAME CHITTY FROM THE MINISTRY OF SPORTING INTRODUCE AREN'T YOU DROPPING CLASSES IN ALL SCHOOLS JUST TO CREATE IDEA THAT DROPPING HIS CHEATING IMAN GENERAL PUBLIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME ANNA AND SILLY OVER WHICH THE TIME NOW IS SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE
IT WASN'T THAT NICE A BIT OF SILENCE A SECOND MAYBE OR TO HAVE IT'S SOMETHING WE VERY VERY RARELY GET IN AN ERA WHEN OUR CALLS OR EMAILS OUR FAVOURITE MUSIC THE NEWS IN LIVE T.V. CAN FOLLOW US PRETTY MUCH WHEREVER WE ARE ON THE PLANET A NEW FILM IN PURSUIT OF SILENCE
ARGUES THAT WE'RE LOSING SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL DOCTOR HELEN LAIUS WAS INTERVIEWED FOR THE FILM AND IS THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK CALLED SILENCE IN SCHOOLS AND SHE JOINS US ON THE LINE FROM COVENTRY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE WE MISSING OUT ON IN YOUR VIEW DOCTOR
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL IT'S IT'S BRAVE OF YOU TO HAVE GIVEN HER JUST THAT BRIEF MOMENT OF SILENCE THERE BUT THANK YOU I HAVE TO SAY THERE WAS PANIC BEHIND THE PLOT THEY JUST THOUGHT PURPLY REASONABLY DO FORGET WHERE I AM AND WHAT I'M DOING THAT I BRIEFLY I'VE NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING NO YOU DID A GOOD THING PEOPLE DO NEED SILENCE AND THEY DO WANT IT MYSELF AND PATRICK SHOWN THE DIRECTOR OF IN PURSUIT OF SILENCE
WE WERE COMMENTING TOGETHER LAST NIGHT ABOUT HOW POPULAR SILENCES WHENEVER IT'S MENTIONED AND I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IT MEANS THAT THERE'S A HUGE HUNGER
IN PEOPLE FOR MORE SILENCE OR NOT NECESSARILY MORE THAT THE SILENCE OF THEIR BIRTHRIGHT AS AS PEOPLE AS HUMAN BEINGS IN THE WORLD WE NEED IT AND WE WANT IT AND YOU DON'T SIMPLY MEAN DO YOU THE ABSENCE OF MORE IS THIS IS AN ACTIVE CHOICE
OH ABSOLUTELY MY RESEARCH ON SILENCE FOCUSES VERY STRONGLY ON THE IDEA THAT POSITIVE SILENCE WHAT I CALL STRONG SILENCE IT'S STRONG ENOUGH TO BRING FORTH BENEFITS THAT IS ONLY GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE HAVE A FREE CHOICE TO WINTER INTO SILENCE AND BE WITH IT
IF IT'S FORCED ON US THAT'S NOT SILENCE IT'S OPPRESSION OR DENIAL AND LOOK LOADS OF OTHER NEGATIVE THINKS THAT YOU WROTE ABOUT SILENCE IN SCHOOLS I MEAN OF COURSE THERE WILL BE MOMENTS WHERE TEACHERS OFTEN SAY TO HER CHILDREN WHEN THEY SILENCE IN CLASS YOU SAY THAT DOESN'T CRACK IT THAT'S NOT DELIVERING WHAT CHILDREN NEED
WELL THIS IS WHERE SILENCE AS A SOCIAL MATERIAL IS SO VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IN SCHOOLS FOR INSTANCE WHERE THE POWER DYNAMIC TENDS TO BE THAT THE TEACHING STAFF ARE IN CONTROL
THEY HAVE THE POWER OVER THE STUDENTS WHEN SILENCE ENTERS THE PICTURE WHAT HAPPENS IS A KIND OF A DEMOCRATIC INTERACTION NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE AND DOES INDEED TAKE PLACE SO SILENCE USED IN ANY KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT CAN EQUALISE AND AS A COST FREE MATERIAL IT'S ALSO REALLY BENEFICIAL
YEAH I'M AFRAID WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE SORRY I WASN'T GOING TO MAKE A TERRIBLE JOKE ABOUT SCIENCE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IF NORWEGIAN TELEVISION NETWORK CAN DO A WHOLE DAY OF BURNING FATHER'S MAYBE A RADIO STATION WITH NO NOISE AT ALL IT IS FOUR MINUTES TO NINE NOW DURING THE FOOTBALL WORLD CUP YOU MAY REMEMBER THERE WAS ONE BIG ENGLAND STAR AND THAT WAS EVAN DAVIS'S DOG MISTER WHIPPY
