IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE SECOND OF APRIL GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH NICK ROBINSON AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THERE ARE FEARS THE TURKEY WON'T BE READY TO RECEIVE MIGRANTS DUE TO BE SENT BACK FROM GREECE FROM MONDAY UNDER A DEAL WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION
CHINA IS IMPOSE NEW TERRACE ON A TYPE OF STEEL MADE IN SOUTH WALES AND LATER IN THE PROGRAMME AUTHOR IRVINE WELSH ON THE RETURN OF ONE A MODERN FICTION'S MOST NOTORIOUS HARD MEN TRAINSPOTTING ZE FRANCIS BEGBIE
BECAUSE HE'S A NUTCASE AND IS MAKING THESE CHOICES TO BE BUT IS STILL IN THE POSITION OF MAKING THESE CHOICES THAT'S BEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH A REHABILITATION PROCESS WHETHER IT'S FROM VIOLENCE FOLLOWERS FROM DRUGS BUT THAT'S FROM YOUR ANYTHING BASICALLY AND COME AWAY OR HUMAN
TO THE WATER AS ON THE WILD WITH A FAIRY HAND IN HAND FOR THE WORLD'S MORE FULL OF WEEPING
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE STOLEN CHILD BY WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS WE'LL BE HEARING FROM SIR BOB GELDOF ABOUT WHAT W.B. YEATS MEANS TO HIM AND TO IRELAND TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS SUSAN
THERE ARE GROWING FEARS THAT TURKEY WON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES IN PLACE TO COPE WITH MIGRANTS DUE TO BE RETURNED FROM GREECE AND AN AGREEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION FROM MONDAY MIGRANTS ARRIVING BY BOAT ON THE GREEK ISLANDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SENT BACK TO TURKEY IF THEY HAVEN'T APPLIED FOR ASYLUM CLAIMS HAVE BEEN REJECTED BUT AS MARK LOWE AND REPORTS FROM WESTERN TURKEY IT ISN'T CLEAR FOR ANYONE BEING RETURNED WILL STAY
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FIRST MIGRANTS ARE DUE BACK HERE IN TURKEY THERE'S LITTLE SIGN OF ANY PREPARATION A FIELD NEAR THE WESTERN TOWN OF PARTICULARLY HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN EARMARKED FOR A REGISTRATION CENTRE BUT IT REMAINS EMPTY
RESIDENTS HERE HAVE CALLED A PROTEST TODAY AGAINST PLANNED REFUGEE CAMPS LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO CALM TEMPERS BY SUGGESTING THOSE SENT BACK HERE WOULD ONLY STAY TEMPORARILY IN PARTICULARLY BEFORE BEING SENT TO OTHER AREAS OF TURKEY
MEANWHILE BOATS ARE STILL ATTEMPTING TO CROSS ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN MIGRANTS WERE CAUGHT BY THE TURKISH COAST GUARD ME DICKIE LEE ON FRIDAY MANY MORE ACTUALLY REACH THE GREEK ISLAND OF LES BOSS THERE ARE STILL GRAVE DOUBTS OVER THE VIABILITY OF THE Y. YOU PLAN NOT LEAST DUE TO CONCERNS THAT MIGRANTS SENT BACK HERE COULD BE MISTREATED WITH SEVERAL AID AGENCIES AND THE E.U. COUNTRIES REFUSING TO RECOGNISE TURKEY AS A SO CALLED SAFE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN
CHINA HAS SAID IT WILL IMPOSE IMPORT TARIFFS OF UP TO FORTY SIX PERCENT ON SOME STEEL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION INCLUDING A TYPE MADE BY A SUBSIDIARY OF TARTAR IN SOUTH WALES TAT HOURS TRYING TO SELL ITS LOSS MAKING BRITISH BUSINESS CAUSE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN BLAMED IN PART ON CHEAP IMPORTS FROM CHINA DAVID CAMERON HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE CRISIS WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT SHE GIN PING HE WAS OUR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JAWLINE
CHINA'S COMMERCE MINISTRY SAID IT WOULD IMPOSE TARIFFS ON IMPORTS OF GRAIN ORIENTED FLAT ROLLED ELECTRICAL STEEL PRODUCED IN JAPAN SOUTH KOREA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION BRITAIN IS NOT A MAJOR EXPORTER OF THIS TYPE OF STEEL BUT A SUBSIDIARY OF TAT STEEL KNOWN AS COGENT DOES PRODUCERS IN NEWPORT
THE U.S. HAS IMPOSED TARIFFS HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX PER CENT ON CHINESE STEEL BUT IT'S EMERGED THAT BRITAIN BLOCKED EFFORTS Y. YOU LEVEL TO IMPOSE SIMILARLY HIGH EMERGENCY TARIFFS THE GOVERNMENT SAID HE DID SOLDIER PREVENT PRICES RISING ON A MUCH WIDER A LIST OF CHINESE IMPORTS AND ADDED THAT IT HAD LED THE ARGUMENT FOR HIGHER TARIFFS ON SOME SPECIFIC CHINESE PRODUCTS SUCH AS REINFORCED STEEL
DAVID CAMERON RAISED THEIR TARIFFS ISSUE WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT AS AN EVENT IN WASHINGTON ON THURSDAY EVENING ACCORDING TO DOWNING STREET MISTER CAMERON SAID THEY NEEDED TO WORK TOGETHER TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES OF OVER CAPACITY AND A GOOD TIME TO DO THAT WOULD BE AT THE G.TWENTY MEETING IN CHINA IN SEPTEMBER
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS WARNED A NUCLEAR SECURITY SUMMAT THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS OBTAINING A NUCLEAR WEAPON IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO GLOBAL SECURITY MORE THAN FIFTEEN NATIONS REPRESENTED AT A MEETING IN WASHINGTON AGREED THAT MORE NEEDED TO BE DONE TO PREVENT NUCLEAR MATERIAL FALLING INTO THE WRONG HANDS FROM WASHINGTON GARY O'DONAHUE REPORTS
PRESIDENT OBAMA CLOSE THE SUMMIT BY SAYING THAT LEADERS HAD COME NOT JUST TO TALK BUT TO ACT INSISTED THAT OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS SINCE THE FIRST SUCH SUMMIT MEANINGFUL PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE TO KEEP NUCLEAR AND RADIOLOGICAL MATERIAL OUT OF THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS
BUT IN THE LIGHT OF A SUCH AS THOSE ON BRUSSELS THERE WAS AN URGENT NEED TO SHARE MORE INFORMATION TO PREVENT ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS AND OTHER SUCH GROUPS FROM DEVELOPING THE ABILITY TO EXPLODE A DIRTY BOMB
TO THAT END PROMISES WERE MADE TO COORDINATES ANTI SMUGGLING EFFORTS AND TO CONTINUE TO SECURE SITES AROUND THE WORLD WHERE NUCLEAR MATERIAL IS HELD
BUT DESPITE ALL THE INITIATIVES THAT LEADERS WHO CAME HERE STILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS REMAINS THE GREATEST THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
THE U.S. MILITARY SAYS IT'S CARRIED OUT A DRONE STRIKE IN SOMALIA ON A VEHICLE CARRYING THREE MEMBERS OF THE MILITANT GROUP AL SHABAB THE PENTAGON SAID THE MAIN TARGET HAD BEEN HASSAN ALLI DOER WHO'S ACCUSED OF ORGANISING BOMB ATTACKS IN WHICH THREE AMERICAN CITIZENS DIED IT SAID IT WAS STILL TRYING TO ESTABLISH WHETHER HE'D BEEN KILLED
THE FOUNDER OF THE CLIPPER ROUND THE WORLD YACHT RACE SIR ROBIN KNOX JOHNSON HAS PAID TRIBUTE TO A WOMAN FROM LONDON WHO'S BECOME THE SECOND BRITISH CREW MEMBER TO DIE IN THIS YEAR'S EVENT SARAH YOUNG WHO WAS FORTY WAS SWEPT OVERBOARD IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN IN SEPTEMBER ANDREW ASHMAN A CREW MEMBER ON THE SAME BOAT DIED AFTER BEING KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS SIR ROBIN SAID RACE ORGANISERS WERE STILL TRYING TO WORK OUT THE FULL CIRCUMSTANCES OF SARAH YOUNG'S DEATH SHE WAS A VERY
VERY EASY PERSON TO LIKE THAT SHE WASN'T EXPERIENCED SAILOR AND I SUPPOSE WE'RE ALL SISTERS ALSO WELL SHE HAPPENED TO GET ONE
SCIENTISTS IN JAPAN SAY THEY'VE SUCCEEDED IN GROWING SKIN COMPLETE WITH HAIR FOLLICLES GLANDS AND NERVES IN A LABORATORY THE TECHNIQUE DESCRIBED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE ADVANCES COULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO LAB GROWN SKIN FOR BURNS VICTIMS RATHER THAN SKIN GRAFTS HERE'S JONATHAN
REGROWING SKIM THAT FEELS AND FUNCTIONS LIKE THE REAL THING HAS LONG BEEN A PRIZE GOAL FOR STEM CELL RESEARCHERS BUT WORKING SKIM IS TRICKY TO CREATE BECAUSE OF ITS MANY INTEGRATED COMPONENTS FROM HAIR FOLLICLES TO TINY MUSCLES AND GLANDS STARTING WITH STEM CELLS MADE FROM A MOUSE'S GUMS THESE RESEARCHERS HAVE NOW GOT CLOSER THAN ANYONE ELSE
WHEN IT WAS TRANSPLANTED BACK INTO A MOUSE THERE SKIN CONNECTED SMOOTHLY TO THE EXISTING TISSUES AND EVEN SPROUTED WORKING HAIRS IT WILL PROBABLY BE FIVE TO TEN YEARS BEFORE THE TECHNIQUE PRODUCERS GRAFTS FOR HUMAN PATIENTS BUT SKIN EXPERTS SAY IT SHOWS A LOT OF PROMISE AND OTHER LABORATORIES WILL BE HURRYING TO REPRODUCE THE FINDINGS EVEN BEFORE IT HELPS PEOPLE WITH BURNS OR SKIN DISEASES THIS RESEARCH COULD SEE DRUGS AND COSMETICS BEING TESTED ON REALISTIC LAB GROWN SKIN INSTEAD OF ANIMALS
A SURVEY CARRIED OUT BY THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH SUGGESTS THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL CONFUSED ABOUT THE CHANGES TO THE STATE PENSION WHICH COME INTO FORCE NEXT WEEK NEARLY HALF OF THOSE QUESTIONED SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE FULL RATE WOULD BE MORE DETAILS FROM HARVEY COOK
THE CHANGES TO THE STATE PENSION AFFECT PEOPLE REACHING RETIREMENT AGE FROM NEXT WEDNESDAY THE FULL RATE WILL BE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE POUNDS A WEEK COMPARE WITH A HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS UNDER THE EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS BUT THAT FIGURE GOES UP WITH ADDITIONAL ENTITLEMENTS WOMEN ARE SELF EMPLOYED SHOULD BE BETTER OFF UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM BUT YOUNGER PEOPLE WILL LOSE OUT
WHICH CARRIED OUT A SURVEY OF PEOPLE APPROACHING THE STATE PENSION AGE IT SUGGESTS THAT WHILE TWO THIRDS WERE AWARE THAT CHANGES WERE ON THEIR WAY ONLY ONE IN FIVE NEW THE STATE PENSION AGE WOULD BE SIXTY FIVE FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN BY THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NEARLY HALF DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH THE NEW STATE PENSION WOULD BE THE PLEDGES MINISTERED LADY ALTMAN SAID THE NEW SYSTEM WOULD BE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND AND PEOPLE WOULD SOON BE ABLE TO ACCESS AN ONLINE STATE PENSION FORECAST
THERE'S A CALL FOR TOUGHER PENALTIES FOR ROGUE BEAUTICIANS OFFERING TEETH WHITENING USING DANGEROUS KITS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION SAYS SOME PRODUCTS ON OFFER CONTAIN UP TO THREE HUNDRED TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE NICK BEAT REPORTS
THOSE LOOKING FOR A DAZZLING SMILE ON THE CHEAP ARE BEING WARNED THAT USING SOME OF THE WHITENING KITS ON OFFER IS LIKE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH WITH BLEACH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION WANTS HARSHER PUNISHMENTS FOR UNLICENSED STAFF WHO PERFORM TREATMENT WITH A LEGAL GELS IT SAYS THEY CAN BURN GUMS CAUSE INFECTIONS AND DAMAGED NERVES
THE BRITISH DENTAL ASSOCIATION CLAIMS RECENT FINDS HAVE BEEN DERISORY THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S HELPING TO MAKE CONSUMERS AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF D.I.Y. KITS BUT WASN'T ABLE TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS PLANNING TO INCREASE FINES FOR ROGUE PRACTITIONERS
NICK BEAT REPORTING IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE PLAN WAS IT WHICH IS MEANT AT LEAST A START TO SOLVE THE MIGRATION CRISIS HE'S DUE TO BEGIN IN JUST TWO DAYS' TIME THE THEORY IS SIMPLE ENOUGH ANYONE WHO EMERGES FROM THE BOATS WHICH BEACH IN THE GREEK ISLANDS CAN BE SENT BACK TO TURKEY HOWEVER NEEDED THEY ARE
IF HAVE NOT APPLIED FOR ASYLUM OR IF THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN REJECTED IN PRACTICE THOUGH THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW SIGNS THAT TURKEY IS READY TO TAKE THEM MARK AND A TURKEY CORRESPONDENT JOINS US FROM WESTERN TURKEY MORNING YOU MARK WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN
BUT AS WE SPENT YESTERDAY IN DICKIE LEE WHICH IS THE AREA THAT HAS BEEN EARMARKED FOR THE MIGRANTS TO BE RETURNED TO ITS JUST ACROSS THE WATER FROM LES BOSS AND WE WENT TO A FIELD THAT IS SAID BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THERE WILL BE A REGISTRATION CENTRE OF SORTS BUT THE FIELD IS COMPLETELY EMPTY WE'RE TOLD THAT CONTAINER CONTAINERS MIGHT BE BROUGHT THERE IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO IN TIME FOR MONDAY AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN BRUSSELS AND THE AUTHORITIES
IN GREECE ARE ADAMANT THAT THE FIRST BATCH OF MIGRANTS WILL BE RETURNED ON MONDAY AROUND PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM THESE WILL BE SYRIANS WHO HAVE NOT WE'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ASYLUM AND NON THE SYRIANS LIKE PAKISTANIS AFGHANS BANGLADESHIS
BUT AT THE MOMENT IT APPEARS REALLY THAT BOTH SIDES ARE KIND OF RUSHING IN A MAD PANIC TOWARDS MONDAY WITHOUT THE NECESSARY RESOURCES OR AN ESSAY PREPARATIONS IS IT ALSO PARTLY BECAUSE LOCAL TURKS DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO HAVE A REFUGEE CAMP ON THEIR DOORSTEP AND MAKE LOCAL POLITICIANS A BIT RELUCTANT TO MAKE THE PREPARATIONS
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE'S A PROTEST PLANNED IN DICKY LEAD TODAY BY LOCALS WHO SAY THEY DO NOT WANT TO REFUGEE CAMP THERE SO LOCAL POLITICIANS ARE SAYING LOOK WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS HOUSE PEOPLE TEMPORARILY IN DICKIE LEE AND THEN MOVE THEM TO OTHER PARTS OF TURKEY TO THE PROVINCES WHERE THEY WERE STAYING BEFORE THEY TOOK THOSE BOATS TO GREECE IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT OF COURSE THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GO
AND OF COURSE HOW WILL THEY BE TREATED ONCE THEY ALL RETURNED TO THOSE PROVINCES WHERE WILL THEY STAY THERE ARE MAJOR CONCERNS AMONG AID AGENCIES ABOUT POSSIBLE MISTREATMENT AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CAME OUT YESTERDAY SAYING
BUT TURKEY IS FORCIBLY RETURNING AROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SYRIANS BACK TO SYRIA EACH DAY IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT REFUTES THAT COMPLETELY BUT THERE IS A REAL CONCERN HERE ABOUT POSSIBLE MISTREATMENT AND POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF THE OF THE RIGHTS OF THE MIGRANTS WHO RETURNED HERE AND THAT COULD MEAN THIS ENDS IN THE COURTS COULDN'T IT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THIS HAS BEEN AGREED BY THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT THE GREEK GOVERNMENT BY THE E.U. THE UN AS WILL BE HERE IN LATER IN THE PROGRAMME AND CHARITIES SAY NO WE DON'T IN THIS IS LEGAL
YEAH EVERY THE SORT OFFICIAL SIDES IF YOU LIKE IN BRUSSELS AND ATHENS AND ANKARA SAYING THIS IS COMPLETELY LEGAL BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF KIND OF SIDESTEPPING REALLY SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN GREECE YES IN THE GREEK PARLIAMENT PASSED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THIS TO TAKE PLACE THEY AVOIDED STUDIOUSLY THE WORDS TURKEYS A SAFE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN THEY SIMPLY SAID WE WILL RETURN THE MIGRANTS TO A SAFE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF E.U. COUNTRIES THAT SIMPLY REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TURKEY IS A SAFE COUNTRY FOR MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES AND AND SO I THINK THERE'LL BE A LOT OF ATTEMPTS AT TWISTING LAW AND GETTING THROUGH LOOPHOLES TO AVOID ANY KIND OF CASES BUT SERIOUSLY MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRESSURES THAT WE START ON MONDAY MY LOAN IN TURKEY THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN FIRST THE ISSUE WAS BRITAIN OPPOSING EUROPEAN EFFORTS TO MAKE IMPORTS OF CHINESE STEAL MORE EXPENSIVE NOW CHINA SAYS IT IS RAISING TARIFFS ON SOME STEEL COMING IN FROM THE E.U. OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CAROLE WALKER JOINS US FROM WESTMINSTER AND CAROL WOULD THAT AFFECT STILL PRODUCED IN BRITAIN
WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL AFFECT ONE OF THE PRODUCTS MADE BY A TUT TUT A SUBSIDIARY KNOWN AS COGENT INTO NEWPORT WE THINK THAT'S ONE OF ABOUT SIXTEEN PRODUCERS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE GOING TO MAKING A CERTAIN KIND OF HI TECH STEEL AND THAT IS GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY SOME OF THESE MUCH HIGHER CHINESE TARIFFS BUT I THINK
MORE BROADLY THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT CHINA IS SLAPPING THOSE TARIFFS OF UP TO FORTY SIX PERCENT ON IMPORTED STEEL FROM THE Y. YOU IT'S JUST GOING TO ADD TO THE ANGER OF SOME STEELWORKERS AND INDEED THE PRESSURE FROM THE OPPOSITION ON THE GOVERNMENT NOW YESTERDAY WE HEARD THE COMMUNITY UNION SAYING IT WAS SIMPLY FALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CLAIM IT WAS DOING EVERYTHING HE POSSIBLY COULD WHEN IT HAD RESISTED
EFFORTS TO LIFT THIS THING CALLED THE LESSER DUTY RULE THAT CAPS A LOW AWFUL LOT OF TARIFFS AGAINST CHINESE PRODUCTS FROM INTO THE E.U. AT ABOUT NINE PERCENT BUT THE GOVERNMENT OF COURSE HAS SAID THAT THE REASON THAT IT OPPOSED THAT
IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S JUST SUCKING UP TO CHINA WHICH IS THE ACCUSATION BUT BECAUSE IF IT DID IMPOSE THESE HIGHER TARIFFS THAT WOULD HIT THE STEEL COSTS WHICH WOULD AFFECT A LOT OF OTHER INDUSTRIES WHICH MAKE THINGS WE STEAL THE CAR INDUSTRY PEOPLE MAKING FRIDGES AND SO ON BUT WOULD IT HAVE HOPED THAT THAT SUPPORT FOR THE CHINESE POSITIONAL EFFECTIVE SUPPORT FOR THE CHINESE POSITION WOULD TO SOME EXTENT PROTECT BRITISH STEEL AGAINST BEING HIT BY THESE SORTS OF CHINESE
CLEARLY TARIFFS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN WHAT IS A VERY COMPLEX MARKET BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A SITUATION WHERE
THERE IS THIS HUGE GLOBAL OVER SUPPLY OF STEEL WHERE CHEAP CHINESE STEEL HEAVILY SUBSIDISED AS BEING SOLD INTO THE E.U. IN SOME CASES AT AROUND SIXTY SIX PERCENT OF COST PRICE AND YOU'VE GOT GLOBAL DEMAND FOR STEEL FALLING I THINK THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE MUCH WIDER THAN THIS AND THE IDEA THAT IMPOSING SOME HIGHER TARIFFS ON CHINESE STEEL
IT'S GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE PROSPECT OF THE BRITISH STEEL INDUSTRY AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM I THINK FRANKLY IT'S GOING TO BE FAR MORE RADICAL SOLUTIONS THAN THAT AND I THINK IT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE WIDER PROBLEMS THAT IS WHY IT'S GOING TO BE SO VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND A BUYER FOR TATA STEEL AND TO SAVE THE PORT TALBOT PLANT
WALKER AT WESTMINSTER THANK YOU IT'S CALLED MOSS SEVEN HOW DO YOU STOP TERRORIST GETTING THEIR HANDS ON THE NUCLEAR MATERIAL WHICH WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BUILD IF NOT A FULLY ARMED NUCLEAR BOMB A SO CALLED DIRTY BOMB WHICH COULD SPREAD RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL ACROSS A CITY THAT WAS THE AIM OF A NUCLEAR SUMMIT WHICH THE LEADERS ARE MORE THAN FIFTY NATIONS ATTENDED IN WASHINGTON AT ITS CLOSE PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THEY'D TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS BUT THERE WAS STILL MORE TO BE DONE
OUR WORK IS BY NO MEANS FINISHED THERE'S STILL A GREAT DEAL OF MILK WE'RE AND RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL AROUND THE WORLD THAT NEEDS TO BE SECURE GLOBAL STARTS PLUTONIUM ARGH ROAR
ER SOME SMALLS ARE EXPENDING IN SOME COUNTRIES WITH MORE SMALL TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHICH COULD BE AT GREATER RISK OF THEFT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE ONE OF THE CENTRAL
I'VE GOT SUMMAT WAS HOW DO WE BUILD ON THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE SO THAT WE HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE CAN
CONTINUE OR IS IN THE STUDIO DOCTOR BAISER NUCLEAR WEAPONS POLICY FELLOW AT THE THINK TANK CHATHAM HOUSE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BEFORE WE FOCUS ON WHAT HAS AND IS THERE MUCH THAT YOU CAN SAY HE'S COME OUT OF THAT SUMMIT THERE IS SUCCESS YES
THE SUMMIT I THINK CREATED A MOVEMENT MOMENTUM TO MINIMISE AND ELIMINATING MATERIAL IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW I THING AROUND THE THIRTY COUNTRIES PLUS TAIWAN A NUCLEAR
HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM FREE WHICH IS SUCCESS AND AT THE SUMMIT WAS SALVE CREATED AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH WHICH IS CALLED THE GIFT BASKET APPROACH WHERE STATES COMET VOLUNTARILY ON HALF TO TACKLE LICK THE MATERIALS IN THEIR COUNTRIES AND AND LET
AND YET HE TALKS ABOUT IN INTERNATIONAL ARCHITECTURE IRAN WERE NOT INVITED WE KNOW THEY HAVE A NUCLEAR PROGRAMME RUSSIA CHOSE NOT TO GO YES THOSE ARE THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST RUSSIA HAD BEEN THERE FOR THE LAST THREE SUMMITS IT DIDN'T COMFORT THERE'S SUMMAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE CONCERNS THAT IS DRIVEN BY STAYED SAYING THEY HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS IN THE BIGGER
SECURITY AND IRAN I THINK HAS NOT BEEN INVITED AND THEY HAD NOT BEEN INVITED BEFORE TO BECAUSE THERE WERE SANCTIONS BEFORE AND THERE ARE STILL SANCTIONS ON IRAN IRAN'S KIND OF SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM AND END THIS SUMMIT IS ABOUT TERRORISM IN A WAY IS THAT SORT OF
TO MAKE PRECISELY THE POINT THAT YES OF COURSE YOU WANT TO REDUCE THE DANGERS THAT ACCIDENTALLY NUCLEAR MATERIAL MAKES IT WAY INTO TERRORIST HANDS BUT ISN'T THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IT IS EITHER GIVEN DELIBERATELY TO TERRORIST GROUP OR AS A RESULT OF WAR SUDDENLY STOCKPILES THAT WERE SAFELY HELD APPARENTLY ARE NO LONGER SAFELY HELP
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A COUNTRY THAT WOULDN'T BE THE LAYING TO GEAR IT'S NICK THE WEAPON TO OR NEED THE MATERIALS TO A TERRORIST ONLY NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF THESE THINGS BUT NOT ANY OTHER COUNTRIES BUT THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF THE MATERIALS AS NOT THERE IT'S NOT BEEN THERE FOR OVER YEARS AND THAT IS THE HAULAGE AND DELVED IN YOUR SECURITY SUMMIT JUST BRIEFLY HOW ANXIOUS OR NOT
SHOULD PEOPLE BE WHEN THEY'RE TOGETHER THEY SHOULD BE ANXIOUS ABOUT RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS IF NOT I'LL NEED A NUCLEAR MATERIALS THERE SHOULD BE MORE TO BE DONE ABADAS THERE SHOULD BE MORE TRANSPARENCY MEASURES THAT SHOULD BE COMING UP THE ISSUE SHOULD NOT ME ONLY FOCUSING ON CIVILIAN REACTORS FOXES JUST ON SEVERELY REACTORS BUT ALSO IT HAD A MILITARY MATERIALS AS WELL DOCTOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOIN US
THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE DOCTORS' UNION THE B.M.A. SAYS THAT THERE ARE NOW FURTHER GROUNDS FOR IT TO CHALLENGE THE NEW JUNIOR DOCTORS CONTRACT AFTER ANY QUALITY ASSESSMENT CARRIED OUT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ASPECTS OF IT WOULD IMPACT DISPROPORTIONATELY ON WOMEN THAT IS BECAUSE MANY PART TIME JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE WOMEN AND THE NEW CONTRACT REPLACES AN ANNUAL PAY INCREMENT WITH ONE LINKED TO STAGES OF TRAINING
THE B.M.A. SAYS THAT FULL TIME DOCTORS ARE BEST PLACED TO PROGRESS QUICKLY THROUGH THOSE STAGES WE'RE JOINED NOW BY DOCTOR RACHEL CLARK A PART TIME JUNIOR DOCTOR IN OXFORD AND FROM GUILDFORD BY ROY LILY FORMER CHAIRMAN OF AN N.H.S. TRUST AND OUR HEALTH ANALYSTS GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING ROY LILIES THIS IS ESSENTIALLY COME FROM A GOVERNMENT EQUALITY ASSESSMENT THAT HE'S PROVIDED FRESH AMMUNITION FOR THE UNION
IT'S BEEN VERY FRANK ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT IN THESE CONTRACTS ARE STRUCK OIL OR WRITTEN IT IS AN OBLIGATION IN LAW TO DO AND INEQUALITIES ASSESSMENT THE LAW REQUIRES THAT ANY INEQUALITIES ARE EITHER REMOVED OR MINIMISED AND COMPLIANCE MAY NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE TREATED MORE FAVOURABLY THAN OTHERS THAT YOU CAN COMPLY
WITH THE REQUIREMENTS AND STILL HAVE AN INEQUALITY IN AS YOU SAY IN THIS CASE THEY'RE ASKING CONCERNS AROUND THERE FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND JUNIOR DOCTORS THE THE DOCUMENT THAT ESTIMATES THAT TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND JUNIOR DOCTORS MIGHT BE IMPACTED BY THIS AND ABOUT ONE HUTTON SCUSE ME ABOUT ONE HUNDRED DOCTORS
IN THEIR FOUNDATION STAGES SO I THINK THEY'VE THEY'VE CUT A BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO BE FRANK ABOUT IT AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS WILL GIVE
JUNIOR DOCTORS GROUNDS TO GO TO COURT I'M NOT A LAWYER I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAVE SORT OF AGREED THAT YES THERE IS THAT AND THEY HAVE TRIED TO ATTENUATED THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT EVERYONE GETS THE THIRTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT UPLIFT IN THAT OFFSETS IT IT BE FOR THE COURTS TO DECIDE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN IF THEY WIN THE INEQUALITIES ARGUMENT IN COURT IT WON'T STOP THE CONTRACT FROM BEING IMPOSED LET ME LET ME TURN THEN TO DOCTOR RACHEL CLARK
HOW WOULD THIS ASPECT OF THE NEW CONTRACT AFFECT YOU
IT WILL AFFECT ME AND WOMEN WHO WORK PART TIME AND MEN WHO WORK PART TIME LIKE ME FUNDAMENTALLY IT WILL DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ME BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT AS I PROGRESSED THROUGH MY YEARS OF TRAINING I WILL END UP EARNING LESS THAN MY MALE DOCTOR COLLEAGUES WHO WERE DOING EXACTLY THE SAME JOB AS ME THAT HIS AGENDA PAY
IT IS WRONG IT IS REGRESSIVE IT IS ABSOLUTELY AN APPROPRIATE THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THIS IS NINETEEN FIFTIES POLITICS AND DAVID CAMERON HIMSELF LAST YEAR NOT ONLY SAID GENDER PAY GAPS WERE RATHER
HE SAID THAT'S SO RATHER I PLEDGE TO ELIMINATE GENDER PAY GAPS FROM BRITAIN WITHIN A GENERATION SO WHAT AN R. US IS HE DOING NOW PRESIDING KNOWINGLY OVER THE CREATION OF A GENDER PAYING UP IN WHAT'S A SUMMIT OF HEALTH IS IS SAYING IS THAT THIS SYSTEM ESSENTIALLY REWARDS THOSE NOT JUST ON THE BASIS OF THE TIME THEY SPEND IN THE N.H.S. TO AN ANNUAL PAY INCREMENT BUT REFLECTS THE TRAINING AND THE EXPERTISE THAT THEY ACQUIRE AT EVERY STAGE
THERE'S AN ARGUMENT FOR THAT ISN'T IT THAT IS FAIRER I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE'S AN ARGUMENT FOR THAT BUT THAT IS PRECISELY WHY IN BRITAIN WE ARE PLAYED WITH SUCH PRONOUNCED GENDER PAY GAPS IF THAT'S THE ONLY ARGUMENT YOU USE WE HAVE THE SIX BIGGEST TO PAY GAP IN EUROPE THAT MEANS THAT ON AVERAGE WOMEN
HERE THAT ARE DOING THE SAME JOBS AS MEN EARN ONLY EIGHTY PER CENT OF MALE SALARIES THAT IS WRONG WHAT AM I MEANT TO SAY TO MY FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHEN SHE LOOKS AT ME AND SAYS AS SHE DOES MUMMY I WANT TO BE A DOCTOR WHEN I GROW UP AM I TO SAY TO HER
THAT'S REALLY WONDERFUL DARLING I WANT YOU TO WORK AS HARD AS YOU CAN DO YOUR BEST AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED BY A SALARY WHICH IS LESS THAN THE MALE DOCTORS DOING WELL WHAT IF YOUR SON SAYS TO YOU LOOK I PROGRESS THIS MUCH FASTER THAN MY FEMALE COLLEAGUE I'VE REACHED THIS STAGE I GAINED ALL THIS EXPERTISE AND I DIDN'T GET PAID ANY MORE FOR IT WELL I BELIEVE THAT IN MODERN BRITAIN
A GREAT MANY MEN AND WOMEN CARE ABOUT GENDER PARITY THAT REALLY MATTERS TO THEM DAVID CAMERON MAY BE HAPPY TO SAY TO CHILDREN IN AND WHEN YOU GROW UP
DESPITE WHAT I DECLARED LAST YEAR WILL LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE WOMEN WILL EARN EIGHTY PERCENT LESS THAN MEN BUT I'M NOT HAPPY TO ACCEPT THAT AND I DON'T BELIEVE MEN AND WOMEN IN BRITAIN ARE EITHER ROY LILY FROM WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER IT SEEMS THAT BUT WHILE JUNIOR DOCTORS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHERS PERHAPS MIKE MIGHT OBJECT TO THE EFFECT OF THIS IT IS NOT ENOUGH IS IT TO DERAIL THIS CONTRACT LEGALLY NO I DON'T THINK IT IS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAVE ACCEPTED THE DIFFICULTY
THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY TRY TO OFFSET IT AND THEY CLAIM THEY'VE OFFSET IT BY GIVING EVERYONE A THIRTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT UPLIFT AND THEY SAY THAT'S ENOUGH TO OFFSET THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE DIFFICULTY HERE IS WE'VE GOT FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN VARYING STAGES OF TRAINING FROM FOUNDATION YEARS UP TO ALMOST CONSULTANTS
WORKING AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY HOSPITALS ACROSS FIFTY SPECIAL TO IS AN EIGHT THOUSAND G.P. SURGERIES AND COMMUNITY NOTHING ELSE SO YOU'VE GOT A VERY COMPLICATED CONTRACT TO YOU BUT IT IF EVERYONE IS GETTING THAT UP LIFT THEN HOW DOES THAT ADDRESS THE THE GENDER ISSUE THE THE DISCRIMINATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACKNOWLEDGES WOULD BE AN INDIRECT EFFECT OF THIS IT'S SO WELL I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THERE SAYING THEY HAVE TRIED TO MINIMISE THE IMPACT OF IT
BUT THEY ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE AWAY WITH IT COMPLETELY AND AS I SAY COMPLIANCE CAN STILL MEAN THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE TREATED MORE FAVOURABLY THAN OTHERS SO IT'S HARD TO SEE REALLY WHAT ARGUMENT THE BEER WOULD RUN IF THEY DO GO TO COURT WITH THIS BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WITH A RUN THIS PAST THEIR LAWYERS BEFORE THEY THEY
PROPOSED RACHEL CLARK YOU MAY YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE THROWN INTO IT CRUCIALLY THE THE THERE THEY'RE IN THEIR PAY UPLIFT WELL IT'S NOT A PAY UPLIFT WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE IT'S AN INCREASING BASIC PAY THAT IS OFFSET AGAINST WITH STRINGENT PAY CUTS ELSEWHERE THE KEY THING FOR ME HERE IS NOT THE LEGALITIES IT'S NOT THERE THAT THE LEGAL CASE IT'S ABOUT DOING WHAT'S RIGHT AND IT'S ABOUT THE CRUNCH SOCIETY WE LIVE IN
IMAGINE IF WE REPLACED WOMEN WITH ANOTHER GROUP IN SOCIETY AND MATCHING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WERE SAYING I'M HAPPY TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST GAY AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE MUSLIM PEOPLE JEWISH PEOPLE BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS AND THAT'S ALL THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS ABOUT
PART TIME PEOPLE RATHER THAN AND ANYONE COULD JUST TO BE PART TIME BUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND THEREFORE IT'S A GENDER ISSUES SO IT IS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST WOMEN AND THEY'D THE GOOD THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY THEY SAY YES WE ARE AWARE OF THAT WE RECOGNISE THAT AND ACTUALLY YOUR COLLATERAL DAMAGE THAT'S FINE IT'S NOT FINE FOR ME AND IT'S NOT FINE FOR ANY OTHER JUNIOR DOCTOR WE WILL SEE WHAT THE COURTS MAKE OF IT IF IT GETS TO THAT STAGE DOCTOR RACHEL CLARK AND REALLY THANK YOU

DECISION MAKING ABOUT POLICIES FOR UKIP HE WOULD LIKE TO CUT THEIR MEMBERSHIP FEES FROM THIRTY TO TEN POUNDS A YEAR BUT WHEN WE SPOKE HE SAID HE WAS FRUSTRATED THIS IDEA OF LOWER FEES HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME AND HADN'T BEEN PUT INTO ACTION BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO IT HIMSELF WHAT IT REALLY MEANS THAT IS HE DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO GET TO THE REFERENDUM AND THEN DRAW UP PULL UP STUMPS HE SEES THIS AS A LONG TERM ANTI ESTABLISHMENT PARTY
HE IS PRETTY CLEAR BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE FUTURES FOR YOU KIT AND SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES ARE PRETTY CLEAR THAT THEY THINK HE MIGHT TRY TO GO EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS I'VE SPOKEN TO SENIOR FIGURES FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PARTY AND MAKES TO BE EXPLICIT ABOUT THIS BY WHICH I MEAN NOT SIMPLY SWORN ENEMIES OF NIGEL FARAGE AND THERE
ARE ENOUGH OF THOSE PUBLIC AND ON THE RECORD AND THEY HAVE HAD A THEORY THAT RELATE NOT JUST TO THE RESULTS OF THE REFERENDUM ISSUE RACE BUT TO THE PROCESS OF HOW WE GET THERE IN THE CAMPAIGN WHICH IS THAT HE COULD USE THE MONEY FROM THE INSURANCE MILLIONAIRE ARUM BANKS AND THE DATA FROM THE LEAVE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BANKS'S FUNDING TO ENTIRE THE REBRAND YOU KIT TO DRIVE A WHOLE NEW MOVEMENT NOW BUT IT'S CLOSER FARRAJ THEY SURELY THERE ARE NO PLANS NO FORMAL STRATEGIC THINKING THEY SAY
FOR AN ENTIRE REMODEL PARTY ON THOSE LINES BUT THE HOPE IS THE POSSIBILITY IS THAT IF THE REFERENDUM DIDN'T GO THEIR WAY THEY COULD EMULATE THE S.N.P. THEY COULD LOSE ON THE DEFINING PURPOSE OF THEIR PARTY BUT ACTUALLY PROSPER IN ELECTIONS IT HAS TO BE SAID AND THERE'S A BIG SORT OF BUT BEHIND ANY OF THIS
FOR ANYONE WHO'S KNOWN YOU A LONG TIME THE IDEA THAT NIGEL FARAGE IS GOING TO RELINQUISH CONTROL OF HIS PARTY TO THE INTERNET WAS FRANKLY PRETTY UNLIKELY ROSS HAWKINS THANK YOU LISTENING TO THAT MATTHEW GOODWIN PROFESSOR OF POLITICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KENT WHO CO WROTE THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO THE RISE OF UKIP REVOLT ON THE RIGHT MORNING TO YOU PROFESSOR GOODWIN CAN HE DO THIS
I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY POTENTIAL IN BRITISH POLITICS FOR A MOVEMENT THAT IS BROADER IN SCOPE AND I THINK THAT'S THE INTERESTING QUESTION WHICH IS WHERE IS BRITISH POLITICS GOING MORE SO THAN WHERE IS YOU KEEP GOING LET'S IMAGINE YOU HAVE A VERY CLOSE REMAIN WIN FIFTY TO FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE VOTE HERE'S A QUESTION WHAT HAPPENS ON THE LEFT OF THOSE
BLUE COLLAR WORKERS WHO FEEL LEFT BEHIND AN ANGRY OVER IMMIGRATION AND ALSO THINK VERY DIFFERENTLY ABOUT EUROPE AND JEREMY CORBIN AND ON THE RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES WHO WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN ANXIOUS OVER MIGRATION AND IF YOU LOOK ACROSS EUROPE WHAT DO YOU DO IN YOUR BOOK AND ELSEWHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST LOOK AT THE FROM NATIONALE IN FRANCE OR THE FIVE STAR MAIDEN IN ITALY THAT'S ESTHER I MEAN THERE ARE DOZENS OF MOVEMENTS ON WHICH ARE GETTING OFTEN AROUND ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE BOAT IN WESTERN EUROPE
WELL RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY GOOD TIMES FOR THE RADICAL IN EUROPE IN AUSTRIA IN SWEDEN IN THE NETHERLANDS THESE PARTIES ARE ATTRACTING RECORD LEVELS OF SUPPORT IN THE POLLS ARE AT ELECTIONS THE QUESTION FOR THE RADICAL RIGHT IN BRITAIN I THINK HIS HOW DO THEY GO FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE VOTE WHICH IS WHERE THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY CONSTRAINED SINCE TWENTY TEN
INTO THE TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE VOTE AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO GET INTO THAT TERRITORY AND THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY INVOLVE COMPLETELY OVERHAULING THE WAY THAT THEY CURRENTLY DO BUSINESS WHICH IS WHY STUFF THAT MIGHT SEEM A BIT SORT OF DETAILED AND FRANKLY DULL ABOUT MEMBERSHIP FEES DOES MATTER
THESE CONVERSATIONS I THINK MATTERED BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THEM WHEN YOU'VE GOT MULTI MULTI MILLIONAIRES WHO ARE WILLING TO THROW BIG MONEY BRITISH POLITICS SOMETHING THAT REALLY WE'VE NOT SEEN IN THAT KIND OF WAY SINCE PERHAPS GOLDSMITH IN NINETY SEVEN YOU'VE THEN GOT THE REFERENDUM PARTY HE WAS YEAH YOU'VE GOT THAT THAT FOUNDATION FOR SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING
YOU SAY THE RADICAL RIGHT I CAN HEAR YOU KIT'S ABOARD ZENO NO NO LO LOOK WE'RE GETTING AS MUCH OF A SUPPORT FROM LABOUR IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AS WE ARE FROM THE TORIES THE IDEA OF THE AS YOU IF YOU WEAR THE BLAZER WEARING GOLF CLUB TIE WEARING YOU GET SUPPORTERS WAY OUT OF DATE ON IT WE DID POINT TO THIS THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR A POPULIST TYPE MOVEMENT ON THE LEFT THE BRITISH POLITICS AS WELL BUT IN A WAY I THINK LABOUR
ACTUALLY GOT OFF QUITE LIGHTLY WITH HER WHEN IT CAME TO UKIP BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT FARRAJ DIDN'T DO AND WHAT OTHER POPULIST IN EUROPE HAVE DONE HE DIDN'T OFFER MANUAL WORKERS THAT ECONOMIC PROTECTIONISM FOR OTHER POLITICIANS IN EUROPE TO DO SO IN A WORD PEOPLE WHO THINK COME JUNE THE TWENTY FOURTH YOU KEEP IS EITHER TRIUMPHANT OR AS FAILED BUT EITHER WAY IT'S PRETTY MUCH OUT A BUSINESS A RIGHT OR WRONG
I THINK WHATEVER HAPPENS AT THE REFERENDUM IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THE KEY PLAYERS ON THE ON THE EURO SCEPTIC RIGHT ARE BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN SURVIVE OVER THE LONGER TERM PROFESSOR GOOD THANK YOU THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTS THAT TARTAR EXPECTS TO SHUT ITS BRITISH PLANTS AND HE'S ONLY GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF SEEKING TO SELL THEM

THE FINANCIAL TIMES SUGGESTS THAT WHAT HAS HURT THE PREVIOUSLY TEFLON CANDIDATE HAS BEEN HIS DEMEANING REMARKS ABOUT WOMEN MOST RECENTLY ON THE SUBJECT OF ABORTION WHILE HIS POLL NUMBERS HAVE NOT SUFFERED FROM WHAT CRITICS TEAM XENOPHOBIC RHETORIC THE F.T. SAYS IS DECLINING POPULARITY AMONG FEMALE VOTERS MAY COME BACK TO HAUNT HIM THE AGONY AUNT AND THE AGONY AUNT I'M SORRY DENISE ROBERTSON WHOSE DEATH WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY IS REMEMBERED IN THE DAILY MIRROR IN A PIECE BY JUDY FINNIGAN ALONGSIDE WHOM SHE FIRST APPEARED ON I.T.V.'S THIS MORNING PROGRAMME

TIME NOW FOR OUR WEEKLY MOMENT TO MEET THE AUTHOR THIS WEEK JIM IS ON HOME TURF LOOKING AT THE RETURN OF ONE OF MODERN FICTION'S MOST NOTORIOUS HARTMAN
LEITH DOCKS IN EDINBURGH DESIRABLE AND EXPENSIVE FLATS ALL AROUND ME HERE ALL WAREHOUSES GETTING A NEW LIFE
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE PARTS OF EDINBURGH THAT ALWAYS HAD A DARK SIDE AS ANYONE WHICH READ IRVINE WELSH KNOWS WHERE
FROM THE DRUGS AND VIOLENCE OF TRAINSPOTTING HE'S WRITTEN ABOUT THE UNDERBELLY OF THE CITY WITH NO RESTRAINT AND WITH A KIND OF WILD RELISH IT IS ROUGH STUFF
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO HIM ABOUT HIS NEW NOVEL THE BLADE ARTIST WHICH SEES THE RETURN OF FRANCIS BEGBIE THE PSYCHOPATHIC VILLAIN OF TRAINSPOTTING WHO'S BECOME AN OUTWARDLY RESPECTABLE ARTIST IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT TURNS OUT HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL
AS READERS DISCOVER WHEN HE'S DRAWN BY A MURDER BACK TO EDINBURGH AND INTO HIS OLD HABITS
I ASKED IRVINE WELSH IF IT HAD BEEN INEVITABLE THAT WE WOULD MEET BEG B. AGAIN
CHRISTMAS STORY FOR THE BIG ISSUE A FEW YEARS BACK AND I'D WRITTEN THE PREVIOUS CHRISTMAS STORY BUT THEY BE JUST BE IN BAGBY BEING VERY VIOLENT AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF HE WAS A LEAST VIOLENT PERSON IN THE ROOM
I THOUGHT HOW CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN I THOUGHT HAVE TO INVENT A PRETTY VIOLENT CHARACTER HOB AT HOME HOW COULD YOU CHANGE SHOW COULD BE DIFFERENT I THOUGHT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE IF YOU JUST LEFT HER CHARACTER THAT THE TRAJECTORY WAS ON YOU'D BE DEAD OR AND PRESENT WOULD BE NOTHING ELSE AND I THOUGHT WOULDN'T IT BE INTERESTING IF HE WAS THAT SOME WAYS REHABILITATED IF HE WAS
I WROTE THAT STORY ON THE PREMISE THAT HE WAS REHABILITATED I'VE GOT INTO THE CHARACTER AND I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE INTEREST EVERYTHING JUST KIND OF THICK AND IN SOME WAY IF YOU'VE GOT CONTROL OF HIS ANGER
BUT UNDERNEATH BUT WAS HE STILL HAD THE SAME DESIRE TO KIND OF FOR BASICALLY FOR THAT KIND OF RELEASE OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE WHAT WE FIND IN THE END THE BLADE ARTIST IS THAT HE'S LIVING A REASONABLY RESPECTABLE LIFE FOR A STRAIGHTFORWARD LIFE AS AN ARTIST IN CALIFORNIA
BUT AT THE FLICK OF A SWITCH HE'S DRAWN BACK INTO THIS RESERVOIR OF VIOLENCE THAT HE'S KNOWN IN THE PAST AND HE TAKES TO IT WITH
I HAVE TO SEE IT AT A GRIM RELISH THAT IS A FEELING THERE THAT THERE'S NO REDEMPTION FOR HIM THAT'S REALLY POSSIBLE THAT THIS WAS ALWAYS INEVITABLE BUT GIVEN THE CHANCE HE'D BE VIOLENT
YEAH I THINK THE THING IS THAT HE HAS KIND OF FEELS ALMOST LIKE THAT I'VE KIND OF GONE INTO THIS POINT IN THIS IS WHAT I KNOW AND THIS IS MY KIND OF MOTION OF THE CARBIE WORRY ANYWAY KINDA REALLY
THE KIND OF FEEL THAT THE CROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT OF THE SMALL NATION STATE IN TERMS OF RESOURCES TO GOING TO GET ME OUT OF FEAR AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE TIME FOR AS LONG AS I CAN CONTAIN IT AND I CAN MANAGE IT THEN EVERYTHING IS FINE WHEN HE GETS BACK TO HIS OLD ENVIRONMENT HE FINDS THAT IT BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTAIN A MANAGER
I'D HAVE BEEN A BABY OR FORWARDS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CARTED OFF TO POLICE CELLS AND PRISON AGAIN IN NO TIME IN THE BOOT BUT HE MANAGES TO KIND OF TO CIRCUMVENT AT ALL IT'S JUST THREW HIS CUT THROUGH IS HIS RELATIVE CALLED WILLINGNESS WHICH SHE NEVER HAD BEFORE TO THAT EXTENT IF YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING IN HIS CHARACTER AND YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE WAY HE BEHAVES ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S POTENTIALLY INSIDE ALL OF US AND MAYBE CLOSER THAN
MANY PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S A TERRIBLY BLEAK VIEW OF THE WORLD ISN'T IT IT'S A STRANGE MOVE BECAUSE AS MORALLY AMBIGUOUS AND SENSORS I THINK IS A VERY VERY BLEAK BOOK IT IS AS YOU SEE HIM IN AT HER HOUSE THAT KIND OF FUN LIKE THAT SORT OF THING THAT THERE IS A DARK THE SUNDA AND EVERYBODY UNDER THE SURFACE AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY OPTIMISTIC IN THE SENSE THAT
WE KHAN CAME THE MANAGER LIVES WITH RIC WHERE'S THE OTHER BIT INTO THIS BOOK MORE WIRES AS THESE KIND OF FUN BECAUSE HE'S A NUTCASE AND IS MAKING THESE CHOICES TO TO BE BARRED IS STILL IN THE POSITION OF MAKING THESE CHOICES THAT'S BEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH A REHABILITATION PROCESS WHETHER IT'S FROM VIOLENCE FOLLOWERS FROM DRUGS BUT THAT'S FROM YOUR ANYTHING BASICALLY
THAT'S IT THAT'S THE ARCHETYPAL EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE DO ONCE HAVE CHOICES ARE EXPANDED THEY MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES HE HE HE DOESN'T HE'S A HE'S HAD A VERY VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER HE'S CLAIMED HE FEELS THAT THAT VIOLENCE OR SAW INTO D.N.A. CAN'T REALLY LOVE WITHER YOU LIVE MOST OF THEIR TIME IN CHICAGO BUT YOU COME HOME TO EDINBURGH QUITE OFTEN WHEN YOU COME
AND YOU LOOK AT THE CITY AND THE WORLD THAT YOU'VE CREATED THE FICTIONAL WORLD THAT YOU'VE CREATED WITH A BIG PIECE AND THE REST OF THEM GOING ROUND DOING UNSPEAKABLE THINGS TO EACH OTHER DO YOU EVER THINK
IS IT STILL THERE JUST UNDER THE SURFACE OR HAVE I MADE IT ALL UP I THINK IT'S STILL THERE I THINK IT'S LIKE IT'S JUST IN DEREK IN THE WORLD IT WILL HAVE THEM IN THE LOVER THE LOVER IN THE WORLD NOW A POST INDUSTRIAL WORLD FOR LARGE SWATHES
THE SAW TURNS OR SIR IS EVERYWHERE IN THE HEART OF THIS KIND OF THING GOING ON THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE IN EDINBURGH AND CHICAGO AND ANYWHERE ELSE THAT JUST NO DIFFERENT IN THAT WAY THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT ARE KIND OF TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE TO THE MAINSTREAM
ON THAT CHARACTERISTICALLY CHEERY NOTE OF HIM ALF I'LL SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CHEERS JIM MEETING THE AUTHOR THERE IT IS THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE YEAR WHAT AM I SAYING THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT I MEAN LUCKY MOST OF YOUR WORK IS YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT I DO APOLOGISE TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER HERE THIS MORNING THE REVEREND DOCTOR ROB MARSHALL PRIEST AT SAINT JOHN'S DIGS WELL WELWYN GARDEN CITY MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NICK MORNING MICHELLE
ARCHITECTURE IS NOT UNLIKE ANY OTHER FIELD FLETCHER'S MEDICINE SCIENCE OR ART THIS WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THAMES AHA HOW DE DESCRIBED HER CHOSEN PROFESSION WHEN SHE GUESSED EDITED THIS PROGRAMME IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT HER UNEXPECTED DEATH ON THURSDAY AFTER A SHORT ILLNESS HAS ROBBED THE WORLD OF A COMPLEX AND BRILLIANT TALENT WHICH HAS YET TO BE FULLY APPRECIATED
ROWAN MOORE IN A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE A FEW YEARS AGO SUGGESTED THAT TO SHOW SHE'S DIVIDES OPINION IS TO PUT IT MILDLY AND INDEED THE PLETHORA OF OBITUARIES PRODUCED IN THE PAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS HAVE PINPOINTED STARK CONTRASTS AND CONTRADICTIONS DESCRIBING HER VARIOUSLY AS BRAVE FEARLESS A RADICAL TRAILBLAZER WHO OFTEN FELT MISUNDERSTOOD AND DIDN'T ALWAYS FIT IN
JANE DUNCAN WHO'S PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTE OF BRITISH ARCHITECTS SUGGEST THAT ZAHA HADID WAS AN INSPIRATIONAL WOMAN THE KIND OF ARCHITECT ONE CAN ONLY DREAM OF BEING VISIONARY AND HIGHLY EXPERIENTIAL HER LEGACY DESPITE HER YOUNG AGE HIS FORMIDABLE YESTERDAY MORNING I LISTENED AGAIN TO THE RECENTLY BROADCAST EDITION OF DESERT ISLAND DISCS IN WHICH THE IRAQI BORN DAME ZAHA WAS THE FIRST WOMAN ARCHITECT TO HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED ON THAT PROGRAMME IN ITS SEVENTY FOUR YEAR HISTORY
IT REALLY IS WELL WORTH A LISTEN BECAUSE AS WELL AS HER SURPRISING CHOICE OF MUSIC THE LISTENER IS TREATED TO A FASCINATING INSIGHT INTO THE THOUGHT PROCESS OF SOMEONE WHO'S NOT REALLY COMPLETELY AT EASE WITH HERSELF SHE'S GOT PLENTY OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HER ROLE IN HER OWN INDUSTRY IN SOCIETY AND WHAT SHE CALLS THE ESTABLISHMENT THE SHE PONDERS WHAT HER LEGACY WILL ULTIMATELY BE
DEN'S AHA MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN IT BUT THE PATRON SAINT OF ARCHITECTS IS SENT THOMAS BASED ON THE TRADITION THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE TWELVE PILLARS ON WHICH CHRIST BUILT HIS CHURCH KNOWN FOR HIS QUESTIONING HIS DOUBT AND HIS DESIRE TO HAVE THINGS PROVED TO HIM HE SITS PRETTY WELL WITH DAMES ARE HUW'S OBSERVATION I'M NOT OUTSIDE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT I'M ON THE EDGE AND DANGLING THERE I QUITE LIKE IT
OF COURSE AS OUR PONDERING OVER THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE DONE TO THE WONDER WHICH WAS PILE MEERA CON FIRMS ARCHITECTURE GOES BACK TO THE VERY EARLIEST CIVILISATIONS AND THERE ARE ALSO PLENTY OF REFERENCES TO PLAN WITH SOME PATTERNS SHAPE AND STRUCTURE AND RELEVANT BUILDING MATERIALS IN THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE
WE UNDERSTAND HOW CREATIVITY AND EXACTITUDE HAS FOREVER BEEN THE NAME OF THE GAME FOR THOSE WHO CONJURE UP MAGNIFICENT AND OCCASIONALLY NOT SO MAGNIFICENT CREATIONS WHICH FASHION OUR LIVES IN THE WONDERFUL BOOK OF PROVERBS THERE'S A GREAT HEBREW VERSE WHICH WOULD STAND AS A BRILLIANT EPITAPH TO THE IMMENSE AND VARIED PORTFOLIO OF DAMES ARE HALF A DEED
BY WISDOM A HOUSE IS BUILT BY UNDERSTANDING IT IS ESTABLISHED AND BY KNOWLEDGE THE ROOMS ARE FILLED WITH PLEASANT AND PRECIOUS RICHES
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR ROB MARSHALL IT IS NOW TEN TO EIGHT I NEVER MEANT TO VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION THAT WAS THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT JACOB ZOOMER'S APOLOGY TO THE NATION AFTER HE WAS FOUND TO HAVE WRONGLY SPEND PUBLIC MONEY ON ASPECTS OF HIS PRIVATE RESIDENCE THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SECURITY A SWIMMING POOL A CATTLE ENCLOSURE AND AMPHITHEATRE HE'S BEEN TOLD TO PAY SOME OF THE MONEY BACK BUT TOLD SOUTH AFRICANS HE HAD NOT BEEN DISHONEST
I RESPECT THEIR JUDGEMENT AND WEARY ABIDE BY EAT THE MUD TOWER HAS CAUSED A LOT OF FRUSTRATION AND CONFUSION FOR WHICH I APOLOGISE ON MY BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF
OFF GOVERNMENT SOME HAD THOUGHT HE WOULD USE THE TELEVISED ADDRESS TO RESIGN AS OPPOSITION PARTIES HAD BEEN CALLING FOR THAT HE'S BEEN REJECTED BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE RULING AND SIKH WEDDING
AMANDA BECAUSE OF EACH BY LOUNGE AND CUMBRIANS HAVE ME
GIRLS NEVER QUEUE FOR EYES TO DEDUCE UP IT DOES PUT BORSCHT MADE IT INVOLVED BUSH AND BUDDY'S MO DOES IT GIVE RISE TO BE POWERFUL IN PEACE
I LOVE YOU IS THAT THIS OVERREACTION UNDER BARDOLPH BE OPPOSITION BADGES DAISY I WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER GOPHERS A GOOD JUDGEMENT WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM SOUTH AFRICA BY DENIS GOLDBERG WHO WAS IN THE DOCK WITH NELSON MANDELA THE RIVONIA TRIAL IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND SERVED TWENTY TWO YEARS IN JAIL GOOD MORNING MISTER GOLDBERG MINING TEAR SHOULD MY ZOOMER HAVE RESIGNED
I BELIEVE SO YES I DON'T THINK THAN JUDGEMENT AS CHANGED ANYTHING HE'D SIMPLY CONFIRMED WHAT QUITE A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR QUITE SOME TIME THE POINT IS
THAT JUST CONFIRMED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS A DUTY TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION OVER AND ABOVE HIS PERSONAL SELF INTEREST AND HE FAILED TO DO SO
OF COURSE THE COURT CANNOT SAY RESIGN BECAUSE THAT WILLIAM PIG OR ATTACKED ATTACK TO SEPARATION OF POWERS ONLY PARLIAMENT CAN DO THAT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM DO SOMETHING HEROIC AND HE HAS BEEN A GREAT HERO
AND THEIR VARIOUS TURAS IRON TO SAVE HIS PARTY TO THE EMBARRASSMENT OF THE CONTINUING SCANDAL AND YET HIS PARTY IS STANDING BY HIM THAT THE PARTY FROM FILM TO WHICH YOU DEDICATED SO MANY YEARS DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A PRESIDENT WHOSE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION
I'VE SUSPECT BUT DISCUSSION AND A BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT WE DO IN THE FORTHCOMING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS AND PRAYERS ARE LONG STEPS
AS A GAMES THE PARTY RALLYING BEHIND HIM AND SAYING WHAT A SINCERE APOLOGY I HAVE TO SAY I'M INSINCERITY IN THE APOLOGY HE SPENT THREE YEARS TRYING NOT TO WHICH CONTRADICTS WHO'S EVER WILLINGNESS TO PLAY AND MORE THAN THAT AT THE BEGINNING
HE SAID I DIDN'T ASK FOR THINGS WIFE SURE NINE AND NOT WHO SAYS THE INTENDANT
HE GOT A PIECE MINUS DON'T IT GET A REPORT THAT SAID THE OTHERS NOTHING BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS ABSOLUTE SECURITY AND THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE EH THERE'S A MILITARY SAME PRODUCE SECURITY POINT AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING IS SECRET AND CANNOT BE ROOM
SO MUCH FOR DEMOCRACY OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY LET ME LET ME BRING IN FOR ASHLEY PILLOW WHOSE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE MAIL AND GUARDIAN SOUTH AFRICA'S FIRST ON MY NEWSPAPER SHE'S JOINING US FROM JOHANNESBURG VARIETY ARE CLEARLY THE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE BEEN VERY ANGRY ABOUT THIS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT THAT BEDROCK OF SUPPORT THAT THE A.N.C. HAS IN THE COUNTRY HOW HOW MUCH OF PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF PRESIDENTS WHOM HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY THIS
YOU KNOW WHAT IT WILL REALLY FIND OUT AT THE NEXT ELECTION THAT'S THE REAL TEST OFFICER I SUPPORT YOU OFTEN SEE QUITE AN OUTCRY FROM A CERTAIN SECTION OF SOCIETY THAT'S PARTICULARLY MIDDLE CLASS ACT OF US EVEN THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT AND YOU'LL SEE THEY'RE ZOOMER'S BASE OF SUPPORT WHICH IS LARGELY A RURAL AREAS IN OUTSIDE OF THE KIND OF MIDDLE CLASS STARTER
GIVE HIM AN ENORMOUS SUPPORT SO PEOPLE WILL OFTEN PREDICTORS ARE MAZDA MYERS OR THAT WHY DOES HE RETAIN SO MUCH SUPPORT IS IT BECAUSE OF THE AGENCY'S PLACE AND SOUTH AFRICAN SOCIETY OR IS IT BECAUSE OF HIS RECORD PARTICULARLY THE FACT THAT HE WENT TO PRISON HIMSELF
I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH BOTH IT IS PEOPLE KEEP VOTING FOR THE PARTY EVEN IF THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN THE LEADER BUT ZIMMER IT'S ALSO EXTREMELY POPULAR AMONGST A VERY LARGE TRADITIONAL BASE WE DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE OR OR OR AW RESONATE WITH A KIND OF MORE LIBERAL PROGRESSIVE ATTITUDES OF OUR CONSTITUTION TO OFTEN FIREMEN MUST BE IN TO HIS CONCERT CONSTITUENCY HE'LL SAY OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THAT GOES AGAINST OUR VALUES FOR EQUALITY FOR WOMAN WRITES WERE HOMOSEXUALS WILL OFTEN SAY REALLY OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THEY GO AGAINST THAT
CHILL YOU'LL BE VERY VERY VERY POPULAR FOR THOSE STATEMENTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HE UNDERSTANDS THE MECHANICS OF THESE THINGS VERY WELL HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO BRANCH LIVE OR BRUSH LEVEL IN COUNTRY IS VERY IMPORTANT IT'S WHAT DRIVES POLITICS AND HE HAD THE SUPPORT OFF THE BRANCHES THERE MIGHT BE
JOHANNESBURG AS AN ENTITY MIGHT BE AGAINST HIM IT DOESN'T COUNT WHEN HE HAS THAT THAT MUCH ADD THEIR SUPPORT ALSO HAD CRUCIALLY WITHIN THE PARTY HE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALMOST AS COMPROMISES HIM THEY DEPENDED ON HIM FOR THEIR CONTINUING POWER AND HE'S GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN POSITION A KEY STATE INSTITUTIONS IN A SIMILAR POSITION WHO WILL NOT ENDANGER HIM DENNIS GO BUT DO YOU REGARD HIM AS CORRUPT
AND REGARD HIM AS BEING AT THE CENTRE OF A CRONY
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO DO VERY WELL IN TERMS OF SELF ENRICHMENT WHEN THEIR PURPOSE SHOULD BE TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY
IT'S NOT JUST THIS CALLED JUDGEMENT IT WAS A WHOLE PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR AND A CULTURE WAS IN THE RULING PARTY AND GOVERNMENT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM BUT HAS DEVELOPED MIGHTILY
NOT ONLY IN HIS PRESIDENCY THAT DEAD A POST WHICH WAS UNPRECEDENTED ANSWER WOULD HAVE TO BE THE ONLY WAY WE CAN CLEAN UP THE GOVERNMENT AND OUR ECONOMY IS IN HE LEAVES AND ALLOWS OTHER PEOPLE TO GOOD AND DIDN'T GO DOWN UPHOLDING IS FUN I THINK TRADITIONAL INSTEAD
BESMIRCHING OUR CONSTITUTION HOW COUNTRY AND YES RURAL PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR TRADITIONALIST NEWS AUDITION RIPPER JEFF HAMPERS BURGERS WHAT ALL OF THOSE IMPORTANT AND WE CAME CLOSE TO LOSING THEM BOTH IN THE LAST NOW NEARLY BENT BRIEFLY CAUGHT IT HERE'S A LAD HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE HE'S PARTY IS STANDING BY HIM IN THE NEXT THE FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS SHOULD PEOPLE VOTE AGAINST THE A.N.C. IN PROTEST AT THIS
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT BECAUSE IN THE END IT WAS CAPABLE OF CARRYING SEWERS OF HANDS FOR MOTION WE NEED THAT WITHOUT
AND WE GOT IT MARKED THE RESULT EARS DENIS GOLDBERG AND THANK YOU BOTH THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT PETER GIBBS HAS THE WEATHER MORNING PETER THANK YOU MUCH GOOD MORNING GOING TO SEE A BIT OF SPRING SUNSHINE AT TIMES THIS WEEKEND AT SOME WARMTH IN IT TWO POTENTIAL TO REACH EIGHTEEN DEGREES IN THE WARMER SPOTS TOMORROW THE FIRST SIGNS OF THAT CLEAR WARM WEATHER MOVING IN ACROSS SOUTH EAST ENGLAND AT THE MOMENT SOME BREAKING THROUGH QUITE NICELY THAT'S A SUNNIER WEATHER WILL REACH SOUTH WEST ENGLAND EASTERN ENGLAND SPRINGING UP ACROSS THE MIDLANDS WALES

TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FIRST MIGRANTS ARE DUE BACK HERE IN TURKEY THERE'S LITTLE SIGN OF ANY PREPARATION A FIELD NEAR THE WESTERN TOWN OF PARTICULARLY HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN EARMARKED FOR A REGISTRATION CENTRE BUT IT REMAINS EMPTY RESIDENTS HERE HAVE CALLED A PROTEST TODAY AGAINST PLANNED REFUGEE CAMPS LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO CALM TEMPERS BY SUGGESTING THOSE SENT BACK HERE WOULD ONLY STAY TEMPORARILY IN PARTICULARLY BEFORE BEING SENT TO OTHER AREAS OF TURKEY
MEANWHILE BOATS ARE STILL ATTEMPTING TO CROSS ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN MIGRANTS WERE CAUGHT BY THE TURKISH COAST GUARD ME DICKIE LEE ON FRIDAY MANY MORE ACTUALLY REACH THE GREEK ISLAND OF LES BOSS THERE ARE STILL GRAVE DOUBTS OVER THE VIABILITY OF THE E.U. YOU PLAN NOT LEAST DUE TO CONCERNS THAT MIGRANTS SENT BACK HERE COULD BE MISTREATED WITH SEVERAL AID AGENCIES AND THE E.U. COUNTRIES REFUSING TO RECOGNISE TURKEY AS A SO CALLED SAFE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN
CHINA HAS SAID IT WILL IMPOSE IMPORT TARIFFS OF UP TO FORTY SIX PERCENT ON SOME STEEL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION INCLUDING A TYPE MADE BY A SUBSIDIARY OF TARTAR IN SOUTH WALES TATTERS TRYING TO SELL ITS LOSS MAKING BRITISH BUSINESS WHOSE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN BLAMED IN PART ON CHEAP IMPORTS FROM CHINA DAVID CAMERON HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE CRISIS WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT SHE JUMPING HERE'S A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JAWLINE

THE U.S. HAS IMPOSED TARIFFS HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX PER CENT ON CHINESE STEEL BUT IT'S EMERGED THAT BRITAIN BLOCKED EFFORTS Y. YOU LEVEL TO IMPOSE SIMILARLY HIGH EMERGENCY TARIFFS THE GOVERNMENT SAID HE DID SOLDIER PREVENT PRICES RISING ON A MUCH WIDER A LIST OF CHINESE IMPORTS AND ADDED THAT IT HAD LED THE ARGUMENT FOR HIGHER TARIFFS ON SOME SPECIFIC CHINESE PRODUCTS SUCH AS REINFORCED STEEL

PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS WARNED HER NUCLEAR SECURITY SUMMAT THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS OBTAINING A NUCLEAR WEAPON IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO GLOBAL SECURITY MORE THAN FIFTEEN NATIONS REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING IN WASHINGTON AGREED THAT MORE NEEDED TO BE DONE TO PREVENT NUCLEAR MATERIAL FALLING INTO THE WRONG HANDS FROM WASHINGTON A CORRESPONDENT GARY O'DONAHUE REPORTS
PRESIDENT OBAMA CLOSE THE SUMMIT BY SAYING THAT LEADERS HAD COME NOT JUST TO TALK BUT TO ACT HE INSISTED THAT OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS SINCE THE FIRST SUCH SUMMIT MEANINGFUL PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE TO KEEP NUCLEAR AND RADIOLOGICAL MATERIAL OUT OF THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS
BUT IN THE LIGHT OF A TAX SUCH AS THOSE ON BRUSSELS THERE WAS AN URGENT NEED TO SHARE MORE INFORMATION TO PREVENT ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS AND OTHER SUCH GROUPS FROM DEVELOPING THE ABILITY TO EXPLODE A DIRTY BOMB
TO THAT END PROMISES WERE MADE TO COORDINATES ANTI SMUGGLING EFFORTS AND TO CONTINUE TO SECURE SITES AROUND THE WORLD WHERE NUCLEAR MATERIAL IS HELD BUT DESPITE ALL THE INITIATIVES THE LEADERS WHO CAME HERE STILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS REMAINS THE GREATEST THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
MY OBAMA HAS SAID THAT RECENT COMMENTS BY THE FRONT RUNNER FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION DONALD TRUMP SHOW THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY OR AT THE WORLD GENERALLY HE WAS REFERRING TO A SUGGESTION BY MISTER TRUMP IN AN INTERVIEW THAT JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA SHOULD DEVELOP THEIR OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS MY OBAMA SAID OTHER COUNTRIES WANTED SOBRIETY AND CLARITY IN U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS

SCIENTISTS IN JAPAN SAY THEY'VE SUCCEEDED IN GROWING SKIN COMPLETE WITH HAIR FOLLICLES GLANDS AND NERVES IN A LABORATORY
THE TECHNIQUE DESCRIBED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE ADVANCES COULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO BURNS VICTIMS RECEIVING LAB GROWN SKIN RATHER THAN SKIN GRAFTS AND SCIENCE REPORTER JONATHAN WEBB HAS THE DETAILS
REGROWING SKIM THAT FEELS AND FUNCTIONS LIKE THE REAL THING HAS LONG BEEN A PRIZE GOAL FOR STEM CELL RESEARCHERS BUT WORKING SKIM IS TRICKY TO CREATE BECAUSE OF ITS MANY INTEGRATED COMPONENTS FROM HAIR FOLLICLES TO TINY MUSCLES AND GLANDS STARTING WITH STEM CELLS MADE FROM A MOUSE'S GUMS THESE RESEARCHERS HAVE NOW GOT CLOSER THEM ANYONE ELSE WHEN IT WAS TRANSPLANTED BACK INTO A MOUSE THERE SKIN CONNECTED SMOOTHLY TO THE EXISTING TISSUES AND EVEN SPROUTED WORKING HERE
IT WILL PROBABLY BE FIVE TO TEN YEARS BEFORE THE TECHNIQUE PRODUCERS GRAFTS FOR HUMAN PATIENTS BUT SKIN EXPERTS SAY IT SHOWS A LOT OF PROMISE AND OTHER LABORATORIES WILL BE HURRYING TO REPRODUCE THE FINDINGS EVEN BEFORE IT HELPS PEOPLE WITH BURNS OR SKIN DISEASES THIS RESEARCH COULD SEE DRUGS AND COSMETICS BEING TESTED ON REALISTIC LAB GROWN SKIN INSTEAD OF ANIMALS
A SURVEY CARRIED OUT BY THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH SUGGESTS THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED ABOUT THE CHANGES TO THE STATE PENSION WHICH COME INTO FORCE NEXT WEEK NEARLY HALF OF THOSE QUESTIONED SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE FULL RATE WOULD BE UNDER THE NEW SINGLE TIER PENSION SYSTEM MORE DETAILS FROM HARDLY COOK THE CHANGES TO THE STATE PENSION AFFECT PEOPLE REACHING RETIREMENT AGE FROM NEXT WEDNESDAY
THE FULL RATE WILL BE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE POUNDS A WEEK COMPARED WITH ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS UNDER THE EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS BUT THAT FIGURE GOES UP WITH ADDITIONAL ENTITLEMENTS WOMEN ARE SELF EMPLOYED SHOULD BE BETTER OFF UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM BUT YOUNGER PEOPLE WILL LOSE OUT
WHICH CARRIED OUT A SURVEY OF PEOPLE APPROACHING THE STATE PENSION AGE IT SUGGESTS THAT WHILE TWO THIRDS WERE AWARE THAT CHANGES WERE ON THEIR WAY ONLY ONE IN FIVE NEW THE STATE PENSION AGE WOULD BE SIXTY FIVE FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN BY THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NEARLY HALF DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH THE NEW STATE PENSION WOULD BE THE PAGERS MINISTERED LADY ALTMAN SAID THE NEW SYSTEM WOULD BE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND AND PEOPLE WOULD SOON BE ABLE TO ACCESS AN ONLINE STATE PENSION FORECAST
SCIENTISTS SAY THE NUMBER OF TIGERS IN THE WORLD COULD RISE DRAMATICALLY IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS ONLY ABOUT THREE THOUSAND TIGERS ARE LEFT IN THE WILD BUT RESEARCHERS BASED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA WHO ANALYSE SATELLITE IMAGES OF THEIR HABITATS SAY THAT FIGURE COULD DOUBLE IN SIX YEARS IF MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO EXTEND THEIR TERRITORY AVAILABLE TO TIGERS THE SIGN TO SAY NUMBERS COULD NEARLY TREBLED IN TWO DECADES
THERE'S A CALL FOR TOUGHER PENALTIES FOR ROGUE BEAUTICIANS OFFERING TEETH WHITENING USING DANGEROUS KITS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS COUNCILS IN ENGLAND AND WALES SAYS SOME OF THE PRODUCTS ON OFFER OR CONTAIN UP TO THREE HUNDRED TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND CAN CAUSE SERIOUS HARM MAKE BEAK REPORTS
THOSE LOOKING FOR A DAZZLING SMILE ON THE CHEAP ARE BEING WARNED THAT USING SOME OF THE WHITENING KITS ON OFFER IS LIKE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH WITH BLEACH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION WANTS HARSHER PUNISHMENTS FOR UNLICENSED STAFF WHO PERFORM TREATMENT WITH A LEGAL GELS IT SAYS THEY CAN BURN GUMS CAUSE INFECTIONS AND DAMAGED NERVES
IN WARWICKSHIRE TRADING STANDARDS SAY THEY'VE SEIZED MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND DANGEROUS KITS OVER THE PAST NINE MONTHS ALONE LAST YEAR THIRTY TWO PEOPLE WERE PROSECUTED BUT THE BRITISH DENTAL ASSOCIATION CLAIMS RECENT FINDS HAVE BEEN DERISORY THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S HELPING TO MAKE CONSUMERS AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF D.I.Y. KITS BUT WASN'T ABLE TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS PLANNING TO INCREASE FINES FOR ROGUE PRACTITIONERS

YOU CAN STILL SEE O.K. SO THE NUMBERS HAVE DROPPED BUT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL RISKING THEIR CROSSING EACH DAY DESPITE THE NEW E.U. DEAL THAT COULD SEE THEM RETURNS TO TURKEY IF THEIR ASYLUM APPLICATIONS ARE REJECTED

MARIA JUST LET PEOPLE WORK FOR YOU

THAT'S ALREADY TRUE ON THE ISLAND OF KIOSKS WHERE A GROUP BROKE OUT OF THE CAMP YESTERDAY ON SOME OS THERE WAS A BRAWL AND THREE STABBINGS
THE RETURNS TO TURKEY SHOULD START ON MONDAY TO EASE THE STRAIN HERE AND YET ONLY A FRACTION OF THE E.U. A SIGN OF EXPERTS THE INTERPRETERS AND POLICEMEN TO HELP HAVE SHOWN UP SO FAR THEY BLAME THE GREEKS YOU'VE ONLY JUST PASSED SOME KEY LEGISLATION THROUGH PARLIAMENT WHERE ARE YOU GOING COME ON
AND AMONG THOSE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY ALL THIS THERE'S FRUSTRATION AND CONFUSION THROUGH THE FENCE OF THE MAURIER DETENTION CENTRE I SPOKE TO ONE WOMAN FROM DAMASCUS HE WAS CLEARLY UPSET THEY ARE
WHICH YEAH THEY DO THEY DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE
DAYS MOST OF THE MIGRANTS TAKING THE BOATS HERE ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN AS THE CONCRETE'S TO A NEW LIFE CLOSES THE WORRY IS THAT THOSE DESPERATE TO REACH EUROPE WILL TRY EVEN RISKIER WAYS
SARAH EYNSFORD HAD REPORTING THERE THE UNITED NATIONS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS E. U. SCHEME I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO PETER SUTHERLAND THE U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION AND DEVELOPMENT I ASKED HIM HOW WORRIED HE WAS ABOUT THE SCHEME
I'M VERY WORRIED I THINK THE DI UN TROU COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES THAN MISSION COMMISSIONER SAW HUMAN RIGHTS AND PULLED THE EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AT THIS TIME BUT THOSE EVELYN SOLES CHAOTIC SITUATIONS IN CAMPS IN GREECE WITH PEOPLE WHO'LL SPIN TRYING TO BREAK OUT OF CAMPS AND ONE ATTEMPTED BUT HAD BURNED THEMSELVES
THIS IS AN APPALLING SITUATION ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ENTERED EUROPE BY SEA IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THAT'S A TIMES LAST YEAR SLUMBER AND ARE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND MIGRANTS FROM GREECE MULL STRUCTURAL MA REFUGEES THE UN SKABB TRYING HAS TO BE TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS ARE AT THE MOMENT THERE IS
GREAT CONFUSION ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY CHAOTIC SITUATIONS I'M FROM REPORTS AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING UNDERGROUND ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEGAL STATUS OF THESE REFUGEES BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THIS ENTIRE E.U. SCHEME IS ILLEGAL
ABSOLUTELY AND THERE ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL REASONS THOSE FIRST OF ALL COLLECTIVE DEPORTATIONS WITHOUT HAVING REGARD TO THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO CLAIM TO BE REFUGEES ARE ILLEGAL NOW WE DON'T KNOW HOTTER IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN THEM COWARDS QUICK CAB FROM NEXT WEEK BUT IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF COLLECTIVE DEPORTATIONS WERE THOSE INDIVIDUAL STRING GET FROM THE ROACH CLAIM ASYLUM VIRTUALLY
SECONDLY THEIR RIGHTS HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY PROTECTED WHERE DARED TO PORT TOOL IN OTHER WORDS TURKEY THERE HAS TO BE ADEQUATE ASSURANCES THAT THEY CAN'T BE SENT BACK FROM TURKEY TO SYRIA FOR AN EXAMPLE OF THEIR SYRIAN REFUGEE SO ASK ALISTAIR WHEREVER
SO DAVE'S A FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL ISSUES WHICH ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE U.N. TO EXPRESS ITS OPINION ON WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE INTO THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION IF THIS IF IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THE CURRENT SITUATION CANNOT CONTINUE AS JAMES THE PROPOSALS THAT CELL HAVE BEEN MADE FROM BRUSSELS HELL'S BEING THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SHARING AMONGST EUROPEAN STATES OF POLES WHO WERE ENTITLED TO ASYLUM
THAT IT'S UNFAIR TO LOAD THE RESPONSIBILITY ON FRONTLINE STATES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION BEING GREECE AND ITALY IN PARTICULAR AND OUTSIDERS
TURKEY LEBANON AND JORDAN AND THAT THERE HAS TO BE A SHARING NOW CLEARLY BY EUROPE INCIDENTALLY BUT GLOBALLY THE RESPONSE BUT THAT HAS NOT BEING AS CONSTRUCTORS AS ONE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED RIGHT ACROSS EUROPE
ALL RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD THAT'S GREAT THAT IS CODE NOT CONSTRUCTIVE FOR A WHOLE SERIES OF GOVERNMENT Z. NO THANKS VERY MUCH THEY'RE NOT HERE AND WE DON'T WANT THEM ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THEY HOLD A MESSAGE MY SOUTHERN SEEMS TO BE TO GOVERNMENTS WHO HAVE POPULATIONS WHO ARE VERY FRIGHTENED OFTEN ABOUT THE INFLUX OF LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE YOUR MESSAGE SEEMS TO BE LET THEM IN TAKE YOUR SHARE THIS IS JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THERE'S NOT A LOT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT
MY MESSAGE I THINK IS THIS THERE ARE THREE OLD SHIPS WERE TO REGARD TO REFUGEES DESPERATE PEOPLE ESCAPING OR AND PERSECUTION THE PRO SPRAWLED PLAYERS TO SEND THEM BACK TO MY MINDLESS INCONCEIVABLE BUT SECOND OPTION IS STOPPING THEM CLOSE TO THE PLACE SWITCHED THEIR ESCAPING DRUM AND CREATING VAST COME
THEY GET BIGGER AND BIGGER WITH NO SHARING OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT SEEMS ALSO NOT TO BE A DESIRABLE OR SUSTAINABLE ROUGE THE TIRED ROOMS IS TRUE SHARING LOCALLY REGIONALLY AND GLOBALLY
AND SOME ARE RESPONDING TO DASH FOR AN EXAMPLE CAN LODGER IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS BY MAKING VERY SIGNIFICANT ALPHA'S IN TERMS OF RESETTLEMENT BUT THOSE THAT DO YOUR MILITARY OR CHERISHES WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING HAS IT BEEN A GRADUAL PUSH
I'VE GOT MY GRAN'S BACK BACK AND BACK BY BUILDING FRANCIS' RIGHT UP THROUGH THE BALKANS STOPPING THEM LEAVING FROM GREECE
NOW PUSHING THEM BACK FROM GREECE ENTRY KIRKY AND SOME ARGUE THAT ALTHOUGH THIS IS DENIED BRO KIRKY PUSHING THEM FROM TURKEY INTO SYRIA IN SOME INSTANCES
THIS IS AN UNSUSTAINABLE PUTS ISH WE HAVE THE GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY HERE AT GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PEOPLE IN DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES WHO WERE PREPARED TO RISK THEIR LIVES TRYING TO GET ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN IT IS OVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT CHANGES TO THE STATE PENSION COME INTO FORCE NEXT WEEK THERE'LL BE A NEW FLAT RATE ALL SINGLE TIER PAYMENT BUT RESEARCH CARRIED OUT BY THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH HAS FOUND THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THE CHANGES MEAN FOR THEM WELL LET'S TRY AND CLEAR THAT UP INTO PAUL LEWIS PRESENTER OF RADIO FOUR'S MONEY BOX
GOOD MORNING YOU'RE CERTAIN YOU'RE CERTAINLY THE MAN TO DO THIS AND I LET LET'S START FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WHO DID THE CHANGES AFFECT THEY ONLY AFFECT PEOPLE WHO REACH STATE PENSION AGE FROM WEDNESDAY THE SIXTH OF APRIL SO THAT'S MEN BORN SIXTH OF APRIL NINETEEN FIFTY ONE AND LATER WOMEN BORN SIXTH OF APRIL NINETEEN FIFTY THREE
AND THEY SAID THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WILL GET THE NEW PENSION ALL EXISTING PENSIONERS WILL CARRY ON GETTING WHAT THEY GET NOW O.K. AND THE FIGURE THAT IS BEING TALKED ABOUT FOUR FOR THOSE NEW RETIREES IS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE POUNDS A WEEK WELL GETS THAT WELL THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CALLS THE FLAT RATE ALL THE SINGLE TIER PENSION AND IN THEORY EVENTUALLY THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE WILL GET THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR ONLY ONE IN EIGHT
OF THOSE REACHING PENSION AGE WILL GET IT MORE THAN HALF WILL GET LESS THAN THAT AND ABOUT A THIRD WILL GET MORE THAN THAT SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FLAT RATE AT ALL AND THAT'S CAUSING A LOT OF THE PROBLEM WHY DUCKS THAT VARIATION WELL THE PEOPLE WHO WILL GET MORE WE'LL GET MORE BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE GOT MORE UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FACE GETTING LESS BECAUSE IT'S ALL CHANGING SO THEY WILL GET MORE AND THEY'LL BE VERY HAPPY THE PEOPLE WHO WILL GET
WE'LL GET SOME EXTRA PENSION FROM THEIR COMPANY ALL THEIR WORKS PENSION AND IN THEORY THAT SHOULD BE AS MUCH AS THE REDUCTION IN THEIR STATE PENSION BUT I SAY IN THEORY BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS IF THAT'S TRUE AND THEY WILL GET LESS THAN THE FLAT RATE AND SOME OF THEM WILL GET ACTUALLY EXACTLY WHAT THEY GET NOW ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE GOT UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM SO
I MEAN I'M SURE EVERYONE IS ALREADY GETTING CONFUSED IF HAVEN'T BEEN COULD BE AND THIS IS JUST TOUCHING THE SURFACE OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE NEW AND THE OLD FRED THE GOVERNMENT AS PENSIONS MINISTER SAYS YOU CAN GO ON ON THE WEBSITE AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS DIGITAL ONLINE INDIVIDUAL STATE PENSION FORECAST IT'LL BE MUCH EASIER TO SEE WHAT YOUR PENSION IS LIKELY TO BE IN THEORY THAT'S TRUE AND I THINK EVENTUALLY MAYBE IN SIX MONTHS OR TWELVE MONTHS THAT WILL BE TRUE BUT FOR THIS FIRST GROUP THAT'S MEN FROM THIS WEDNESDAY
AND THEN THE FIRST GROUP OF WOMEN REACHING STATE PENSION AGE WON'T ACTUALLY BE TILL THE SIXTH OF JULY THEY WILL FIND IT VERY CONFUSING BECAUSE THESE NEW SYSTEMS WON'T WORK AS WELL FOR THEM IF YOU'RE REACHING PENSION AGE IN TWO OR THREE YEARS OR FIVE YEARS AND YES THE NEW SYSTEM WILL HELP AND YOU CAN EVEN SEE HOW TO BOOST YOUR PENSION BUT FOR THIS FIRST BATCH OF RETIREES
FOUR HUNDRED ODD THOUSAND PEOPLE I THINK HE IS GOING TO BE CONFUSING BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT FLAT RATE IT'S NOT A SINGLE TEAR MY JOKE AS IT WON'T BE A SINGLE TEAR IT WOULD BE A VALE OF TEARS THAT WILL BE SEEING EVERYTHING WILL I KNOW IT WAS IT WAS THAT CONFUSION FOR THIS INITIAL GROUP INEVITABLE WHEN WHEN YOU CONSIDER CHANGING THE SYSTEM TO THIS EXTENT
POSSIBLY STEVE WEBB THE PREVIOUS PENSIONS MINISTER WHO FORCE THIS THROUGH PARLIAMENT AND IT REALLY IS HIS BABY HE WAS TOLD VERY CLEARLY BY THE TREASURY DO WHAT YOU LIKE BUT DON'T SPEND ANY MORE MONEY AND ALL THESE COMPLEXITIES AND THERE ARE MANY MANY MORE THAT I HAVEN'T EVEN TOUCHED ON WERE WAYS OF SORT OF CHIPPING AWAY AT THE COST COS OBVIOUSLY IF YOU GIVE SOMEONE A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE INSTEAD OF
JUST UNDER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY WHICH IS THE CURRENT PENSION IN THEORY IT SHOULD COST MONEY ACTUALLY IT WON'T COST MONEY BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE COMPLEXITIES CHIPPING AWAY AT THE COST AND IT WAS A WAY OF DOING IT UP NEIL COS IN FACT THE NEW SYSTEM WILL COST RATHER LESS THAN THE PRESENT SYSTEM IN THE LONG TERM AND SOFA FOR THIS CRUCIAL GROUP OF PEOPLE THOSE WHO ARE RETIRING FROM NEXT WEEK AND FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR SO
WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE THEM TO DO OTHER THAN LISTEN TO MONEY BOX WHERE'S THE BEST INFORMATION WELL THERE IS A LOT ON THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE AND IT IS GETTING BETTER I MEAN I MIGHT REFER THEM OF COURSE TO MY BLOG PAUL LEWIS MONEY BUT A BLOCK SPOT NOT CO DOT U.K. WHICH DOES SET OUT ALL THE DETAILS LOOKS AT FIGURES WHICH I GOT FROM THE D.W.P. THROUGH FREEDOM OF INFORMATION BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE CONFUSED THEY'RE GOING TO THINK PEOPLE HAVE GOT LOOKED INTO A THE LIME ONLY GETTING THIS AND THEY'LL HAVE TO CONTACT THE D.W.P. THEY MAY BE VERY BUSY IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS
LEWIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO WAGER BEDROOMS PAUSING TO WRITE DOWN THE EXACT ADDRESS PAUL THIS IS BLOCK SPOT TWENTY FOUR MINUTES HOPEFULLY IT ENOUGH ADVERTISING FROM YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT IS DO YOU REMEMBER THE SCENE THE STEAM TRAIN COMES TO A SHUDDERING STOP BEFORE CAREERING OFF THE TRACKS THE MACHINE GUNS OPENED FIRE MASTERMINDING THE AMBUSH AN ENGLISHMAN LEADING ARAB FIGHTERS
LAWRENCE OF ARABIA OF COURSE IN DAVID LEAN'S MAGNIFICENT BIOPIC LAWRENCE T.E. LAWRENCE AND THE ARAB REVOLT HE MASTERMINDED A CENTURY AGO WERE VERY REAL OF COURSE BUT DOUBT HAS OFTEN BEEN CAST ABOUT THE EXPLOITS PER TRAY NOT JUST IN THE FILM BUT ORIGINALLY IN HIS BOOK THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM UNTIL NOW THAT IS THANKS TO THE FINDING OF A SINGLE BUT IT FOUND IN THE ARABIAN DESERT NEIL FAULKNER AUTHOR AN ARCHAEOLOGIST TO BRISTOL UNIVERSITY JOINS US
WHY DOES THIS BULLET FOUND IN THE DESERT NEIL MATTER SO MUCH WELL NICK I MEAN THE BULLET IS VERY NICE TO HAVE OF COURSE COS WE'RE PRETTY CERTAIN IT WAS ACTUALLY FIRED BY LAWRENCE BUT IT'S THE WIDER PICTURE I THINK THAT'S REALLY HELPING US TO SAY SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM WAS A VERY RELIABLE WAR MEMOIRS
WHEN WE WENT TO THIS PARTICULAR SITE WHICH IS IN A MILITARISED ZONE ACTUALLY RIGHT DOWN ON THE JORDANIAN BORDER WITH SAUDI ARABIA WE NEEDED A MILITARY ESCORT TO WORK THERE TOOK US SOME TIME TO LOCATE THE SITE WE WERE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN WE WERE IN THE RIGHT PLACE BECAUSE THE LANDSCAPE MATCHED WHAT LAURENCE WAS DESCRIBING PRECISELY AND THEN WERE NOW METAL DETECTORS PICKED UP THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPENT CARTRIDGES AND BULLETS
THEY WERE IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT PLACE TO GIVE US A MATCH WITH LAWRENCE'S ACCOUNT WELL IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THIS IS THE SORT OF BULLET FIRED AT THIS TIME HOW ON EARTH DID YOU KNOW IT WAS FIRED FROM LAWRENCE'S OWN GIRL WELL THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION WE KNOW THAT LAWRENCE USED A QUA A COLT AUTOMATIC WHICH WAS A VERY NEW STATE OF THE ART AMERICAN GUN WHICH HE'D ORDERED THROUGH A FRIEND WHO WAS IN AMERICA
AND IT'S ALMOST CERTAINLY THE CASE HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON INVOLVED IN THE BATTLE WHO COULD POSSIBLY HAVE HAD THIS BANG UP TO DATE PIECE OF KIT AND HISTORICALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO NEITHER KNOW THE MAN OR FRANKLY HAVE WATCH THE FILM
WHY SHOULD THEY CARE WHERE THEIR T.E. LAWRENCE'S ACCOUNTS OF THESE EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENTS REALLY ARE NOT JUST TALL TALES AS PEOPLE OFTEN THOUGHT BUT A ALMOST A PROPER HISTORY WHEN I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE LAURENT STORY IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT IS OF COURSE THAT HE EFFECTIVELY SUFFERED A BREAKDOWN AS A RESULT OF HIS ROLE IN THE WAR HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIDDLED WITH GUILT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAW REALLY AS THE BETRAYAL OF THE ARAB CAUSE BY THE BRITISH AFTER THE WAR
AND I THINK THE MIDDLE EAST IT'S WAS CREATED AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST ONE IS THE MIDDLE EAST THAT IS STILL WITH US TODAY WITH ALL OF ITS PROBLEMS SO THE LAURENT STORY IS VERY MUCH BOUND UP WITH OUR UNDERSTANDING I THINK OF THE MODERN MIDDLE EAST HE WAS IN THAT PHRASE THAT WAS USED A FEW YEARS AGO PRETTY ECONOMICAL WITH THE TRUTH AT TIMES IT WASN'T HE WAS TELLER OF TALL TALES
I THINK THAT WAS PROBABLY TRUE WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN BEFORE THE WAR I THINK WAS A BIT MISCHIEVOUS ABOUT SOME OF HIS ACCOUNTS I THINK THE THE MESSAGE WE'VE GOT FROM THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM IT'S A VERY VERY RELIABLE WARM THEN WHAT WE'VE GROUND TRUTH DID IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PLACES
AND I THINK THE LAWRENCE WHO EMERGES FROM THE WAR IS A MUCH DARKER AND MUCH MORE TROUBLED MAN WHO ACTUALLY ISN'T WANTING TO BLOW HIS OWN TRUMPET BUT HE'S WANTING TO DEAL WITH THOSE DEEP LAYERS OF GUILT WHICH IS AFFLICTED BY AFTER THE WAR SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM IS REALLY AN EXERCISE IN CATHARSIS HE'S NOT WANTING TO EXAGGERATE HIS OWN ROLE ILL THOUGHT AND I THINK YOU'RE VERY MUCH READ THE BOOK WATCH THE FILMING TODAY HAVE PLUGS IN IT THANK YOU
IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND TSUNAMI SHELLS HERE WITH THE SPORT I'M A SHOUT FULL TIME CHAMPION TIGER WOODS WILL NOT TAKE PART IN NEXT WEEK'S U.S. MASTERS THE FORMER WORLD NUMBER ONE HAS ADMITTED HE ISN'T PHYSICALLY READY FOR COMPETITIVE PLAY AS HE CONTINUES HIS RECOVERY FROM TWO BACK SURGERIES LITTLE B.

RIGHT SHORT THEY'RE BLAMING EVERYBODY THAT THEY START AT THE TOP WITH THE OWNER RANDY LERNER WHOSE INVERTED COMMAS LOST INTEREST HE DOESN'T EVEN COME TO THE GAMES ANY MORE THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE TOM FOX THEY BLAME HIM FOR MAKING SUCCESSION ABOUT APPOINTMENTS BLUSTERY MANAGERS TIM SHERWOOD AND WHEN WE GARDEN MAYBE BEING AMONGST THOSE THEY BLAME A GENTLEMAN CALLED HENRIK ARMSTEAD WHO WAS THE FORMER SPORTING DIRECTOR HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE RECRUITMENT OVER THE SUMMER MONTHS WHERE VILLA SPENT FIFTY MILLION POUNDS
ON A GROUP OF PLAYERS THAT HAVE WON ONLY THREE GAMES AND THEY'RE BOTTOM OF THE LEAGUE AND THEY ALSO BLAME THE PLAYERS BECAUSE SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT THE SEASON WHAT YOU WOULD CALL SENIOR PLAYERS HAVE LET THE FANS DOWN JERMYN ESCOTT TWEETING FROM HIS POCKETS WHEN HIS PHONE WAS IN HIS POCKET HAVE A NEW CAR AND AS YOU MENTION THERE GABRIELLA BUNDLE WHORE CONDUCTING SOME SUCH AMOUNT OF THE COVERED MOUNT MOUNT AN INVESTIGATION AND PULLED HIM OUT THE SQUAD FOR TODAY'S GAME NOW

I THINK THIS TIME THEY'RE GOING TO GO FOR AN ENGLISH MANAGER I THINK THEY'VE HAD THEIR FINGERS INVERTED COMMAS BURNT BY THE EXPERIMENT WITH REMMY GUARD THEY NEED SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THE THE BLOOD AND THUNDER IF YOU LIKE OF ENGLISH CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL AS WELL AS HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF QUALITY TO KEEP YOU IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE IF AS AND WHEN THEY GET THAT I'VE SEEN COMMENTS THAT WOULD EVEN STRUGGLE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP TODAY WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE I THINK THAT'S JUST NATURAL KIND OF PESSIMISTIC FEAR THAT THE CREEPS IN WHEN YOU'VE HAD SUCH A BAD SEASON AS VILLA HAVE
THERE IS A NEW MANAGER TO BE APPOINTED THE WRIST THE REPLACEMENT FOR HENRIK ARMSTEAD THE SPORTING DIRECTOR TO BE RECRUITED AS WELL AND YOU WOULD GUESS THAT THERE PLAYING SQUAD WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT ON THE FIRST DAY OF NEXT SEASON SO ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE VERY UNKNOWN QUANTITIES AT THE MOMENT AND ALL THREE OF THOSE WILL BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT NEXT SEASON I CAN'T SEE VILLA WITH THE MOOD BOARD INCLUDES FORMER BANK OF ENGLAND GOLD NOTICED MOVING KING THEY'VE GOT TO DAVID BERNSTEIN FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE F.A.

THAT REPORT FROM ZOE CONWAY IN LONGBRIDGE WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM IPSWICH BY AND PETTIFER DIRECTOR OF PRIME ECONOMICS AND A MEMBER OF LABOUR'S ECONOMIC ADVISORY GROUP AND BY GERHARD LINES CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO THE MAYOR OF LONDON GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GIGGLING AND PETTIFER TAKE US THROUGH THE INDUSTRY'S ALL THE SECTORS WHICH YOU REGARD AS STRATEGICALLY VITAL FOR THIS COUNTRY
I THINK THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES ARE INDUSTRY THERE ARE THOSE WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND THAT INCLUDES DEFENCE FOOD AND ENERGY AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE THAT ARE IN
IMPORTANT TO US AS A SOCIETY IN TERMS OF FUTURE EMPLOYMENT AND WELLBEING AND THAT RELATE FOR EXAMPLE TO GREEN ENERGY INTO TO THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT IT IS ALSO A DAUGHTER INCLUDES FOR EXAMPLE EDUCATION AND KEEPING OURSELVES SKILLED UP AND PREPARED FOR
WHATEVER MAY COME INTO THE FUTURE SO THERE'S THE TWO CATEGORIES OF INDUSTRIES THAT I THINK GOVERNMENTS AND POLITICIANS IN PARTICULAR HAVE A MORAL DUTY TO PROTECT BECAUSE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABOUT THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION GERHARD LIONS WHAT WITH THAT LIST TO LOOK LIKE TO YOU ASH I WOULD AGREE WITH WHAT AND JUST NOW AND I WOULDN'T REALLY ADD TO THAT I THINK
TWO THINGS HERE ONE IS THAT STRATEGIC INDUSTRIES INDUSTRIES THAT YOU NEED TO EFFECTIVELY THE RIGHT WHATEVER MARKET CONDITIONS AND BEYOND FOR ANNE'S JUST MENTIONED IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND ANY OTHERS IN THE IDEA OF A STRATEGIC INDUSTRY NOW IS VERY DIFFERENT TO THE PAST ONLY DEFENCE AND FOOD AND ALSO AS WAS JUST MENTIONED INDUSTRIES ARE KEY TO
ECONOMIC INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY THE ONDE SORT OF MARKET CONDITIONS SORT OF CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM IN THE SENSE THAT THE SECOND ONE I WAS GOING TO MAKE IS THIS
BEYOND THE STRATEGIC IN THE STREET YOU NEED TO BE PRAGMATIC AND CREATIVE AND CONSIDERING HOW TO HANDLE ANY SECTOR OR IN THE STREET THAT'S HIT BY AN EXTERNAL ECONOMIC SHOCK BUT BY A TEMPORARY CHANGE YOUR MARKET CONDITIONS AND THERE YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE WIDER ECONOMIC IMPACT SO YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFY STRATEGIC INDUSTRIES THESE
INDUSTRIES BUT YOU'RE GOING TO UNDERWRITE WHAT ABOUT THE MARKET CONDITIONS AND THEN THE SECOND POINT IS THE NEED FOR PRAGMATISM BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME IN THE STREET AND NOT STRATEGIC THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO COME IN AND CONSIDER HELPING THROUGH THE BACK FOR EXAMPLE WEB OF THE FRANKLY RECEIVED A LOT OF SUPPORT IN TERMS OF THE BANKING SECTOR AT THE ONLY PART OF THE BANKING SECTOR THAT IS REALLY STRATEGIC IS THE PAYMENT SYSTEM WENT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE REASON THE BANKS WERE HELPED OUT
WAS BECAUSE OF THE WIDER ECONOMIC IMPACT NOT THE FACT THAT YOU WANTED TO REWARD THE BANKS AND WHEN WE LOOK AT OTHER INDUSTRIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WEATHER IN WALES OR OTHERWISE YOU DO YOU NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT NEAR TERM ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE IMPACT ON THE LOCAL AREA AS WELL BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT TO STRATEGIC IN THE STREET WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT ANN AND PETTER FOR THAT WHEN IT COMES TO HER WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE TO
PROP UP MAINTAIN HOWEVER YOU CHOOSE TO SAY THAT YOU NEED TO THINK MORE BROADLY THAN STRATEGIC WELL THE POINT IS THIS THAT THAT THAT WHEREAS SOCIETY AS WE'RE VULNERABLE AND WE ELECT OUR POLITICIANS TO PROTECT US
AGAINST THREATS TO OUR SOCIETY INTO OUR ECONOMY AND THOSE THREATS CAN ARISE NOT JUST FROM THE INDUSTRY'S CONCERNED BUT ALSO FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE MOVEMENTS IN THE VALUE OF OUR CURRENCY SO OUR CURRENCY WERE TO FALL IN VALUE IN THE COST OF IMPORTING FOR EXAMPLE STEAL FROM CHINA OR MILK FROM CHINA
WERE RISE INEXORABLY AND WE WILL HAVE NO DEFENCE AGAINST THAT AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK FOR OUR POLITICIANS TO THINK ABOUT PROTECTING US IN IN THE LONG TERM AND DOING SO BY IDENTIFYING KEY INDUSTRIES
ENSURING THAT WE MAINTAIN THE CAPACITY TO FUNCTION IN THOSE INDUSTRIES A GODLESS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE WE COME TO THE ESSENTIAL IDEOLOGICAL FAULT LINE BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU IN AND ENCAPSULATED IN YOUR IN YOUR ATTITUDE TO MARKET FORCES PRESUMABLY DEADLINES YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR YOU'D BE MUCH MORE RELUCTANT TO GO DOWN THERE THE PROTECTIONIST ROOT PROTECTION ISN'T DOESN'T HELP ANYONE IT'S THE WAY OF ITS TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT WING THINK ABOUT PROTECTIONISM
INITIAL PROBLEM IS THEN HANDLED IN THE WRONG WAY THERE ARE TWO ISSUES HERE ONE IS GLOBALISATION THE OTHER IS THE STRATEGIC POLICY PARADOX AS I CALL IT FIRST GLOBALISATION YOU PLAYED WITH MARKET
RULE WAS MARKET PRICES WHICH ARE GENERALLY LOWER BUT YOU DO NEED TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE PLAYS BY THE FARE RULES HENCE YOU NEED TO USE ANTI DUMPING WHEN NECESSARY AND THE SECOND IS THAT THE COUNTRY HERE LEADS A STRATEGIC PLANNING
WORK AND STRATEGIC PLANNING ANOTHER COUNTRY'S CREATES THIS PARADOX HE RUN THE ECONOMY WELL YOU MAY PUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THE PARADOXES THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE STRATEGIC IN THE STREETS YOU NEED TO THINK LONG TERM IS THE KEY ISSUE AND PART OF HER WHAT DON'T WE PROTECT THAT WE SHOULD AND I WANTED SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU THINK OF WHAT THE ECONOMIST ECONOMIST MURRAY WOODS HAS SAID SHE THINKS
THE AREA WHERE WHERE BRITAIN REALLY IS VERY LAX IN HER VIEW IS CYBER SECURITY WILL BE GIVE CONTRACTS AWAY OVERSEAS WILL KNOW WHERE WE SHOULD BE RETAINING CONTROL OVER THEM YES AND THEN WE'RE DOMINATED BY AN IDEOLOGY WHICH IS AT THE MARKET KNOWS BEST THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET CAN GOVERNOR
AND WHAT WE NEED IS IS A GOVERNMENT WHICH ACTUALLY MANAGES THE MARKET AND MANAGERS IN THE MONEY MARKET INN IN CYBER SECURITY AS WELL AS IN MILK WHO WE'VE ALLOWED FOR EXAMPLE ARE DAIRY FARMERS TO ABANDON THEIR FARMS BECAUSE WE WERE CONFIDENT THAT FOREVER THE CHINESE WILL PROVIDE US WITH MILK AND THERE ARE
COULD BE NO SUCH CERTAINTY I'M NOT IN FAVOUR OF PROTECTIONISM AS SUCH I'M IN FAVOUR OF THE GOVERNMENT MANAGING MARKETS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF SOCIETY IN THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF SOCIETY AND YESTERDAY A TORY POLITICIAN SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO ABOUT STEEL
IT WAS LIKE GRAVITY AND MARKET WAS LIKE GRAVITY IT WAS GOING TO COLLAPSE AND WE WOULD JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT NOW THAT IS A FATALISM AND DEFEATISM ON ABOUT THAT'S RIGHT UP ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT AND OUR POLITICIANS
WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING OUR ECONOMIC VERY BRIEFLY I THINK THE WRONG WORD HERE IS BEING USED PROTECTION BUT WE'RE TALKING TO ANNE AND I HE'S A BIT UP IN THE PLANE IT'S ABOUT HAVING STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK IT'S HAVING REGIONAL POLICY IS MAKING SURE THAT YOU ENABLE THE PRIVATE SECTOR GOVERNMENTS AND POLITICIANS ARE SITTING IN RULES CAN'T
BELIEVERS YOU NEED TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE QUICKLY NEIGHBOURLY ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S NOT ABOUT PROTECTION HEAP IT'S ABOUT HANDLING NEAR TERM SHOCKS AND HAVING A LONG TERM STRATEGIC PLANNING FRANK GERHARD LINES AND AND PETTIFER THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THEY GOLDIN LEADS ON THE CASE OF SIR PRAS AHMED A MAN A MAN FROM LONDON JAIL FOR TWO YEARS FOR HOLDING HIS WIFE IN DOMESTIC SERVITUDE AND HOPE IT MIGHT ENCOURAGE MORE VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD THE PAPER REPORTS THE LEGAL EXPERTS AND CHARITIES BELIEVE THE CASE TO BE POTENTIALLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG IN TERMS OF MODERN SLAVERY IN THE U.K.
IT'S SCIENCE RECENT FIGURES FROM THE HOME OFFICE ADVISOR ESTIMATING THEY MIGHT BE UP TO THIRTEEN THOUSAND POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF THE CRIME EACH YEAR THE EYES HEADLINE IS ROYAL NAVY ABANDONS FALKLANDS IT REPORTS THAT TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AND STAFF SHORTAGES MEAN THE ISLANDS HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT WARSHIP PROTECTION FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE WAR WITH ARGENTINA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO IN A STATEMENT A MINISTRY OF DEFENCE SPOKESMAN SAYS THE FALKLANDS REMAIN WELL PROTECTED BY A PATROL VESSEL A ROYAL FLEET AUXILIARY SUPPORT SHIP
AND TWELVE HUNDRED U.K. PERSONNEL OPERATING R.A.F. TYPHOONS AND GROUND DEFENCES ONGOING TATA STEEL CRISIS IS DIGESTED IN MANY OF THE PAPER'S COMMENTS SECTIONS IN ITS LEADER THE SUN SAYS ENERGY COSTS ARE FIFTY PERCENT HIGHER IN BRITAIN THAN IN FRANCE SOMETHING IT BLAMES ON ENVIRONMENTAL LEVIES THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO WAKE UP TO THE COST OF THE GREEN TAXES IT SAYS AND DUMP THEM
FOR THE TIMES THE KEA IS A NEW BALANCE IN RELATIONS BETWEEN BRITAIN AND CHINA IT SAYS THE GOVERNMENT STOPPED TERRACE BEING IMPOSED ON CHINESE STEEL SUGGESTING THAT MINISTERS HAVE BEEN OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT CURRYING FAVOUR BRITAIN SHOULD BE MORE HARD NOSED IN IT'S DEALING WITH BEIJING SO SAYS THE TIMES LEADER COLUMN BUT DAILY MAIL WORRIES AT THE APPARENT COLLAPSE OF THE BRITISH STEEL INDUSTRY IS ONLY THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF THE CONTROL OF AN IMPORTANT NATIONAL ASSET BEING SURRENDERED TO THE HIGHEST FOREIGN BIDDER
IT INVITES ITS READERS TO CONSIDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF BRITAIN FACED INVASION WITHOUT THEIR CAPACITY TO PRODUCE STEEL THE MALE CONCLUDE SOME INDUSTRIES ALSO STRATEGICALLY VITAL THAT THEY STAND APART FROM THE NORMAL RUN OF COMMERCE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH LEADER REACHES A DIFFERENT VERDICT WAS HOPING FOR THE BEST IT SUGGEST IT'S HARD NOT TO DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT IT'S BETTER TO PREPARE FOR A POST INDUSTRIAL FUTURE IN DOING SO THE TELEGRAPH ARGUES THE GOVERNMENT MUST CHALLENGE THE NARRATIVE OF DEFEATISM
TAX CUTS AND INVESTMENT THE PAPER SAYS ARE HEALTHY FREE MARKET CAN GIVE THOSE LEFT BEHIND BY THE POTENTIAL CLOSURE OF STEEL PLANS A SECOND CHANCE AND FRAUD SUFFERED BY BRITISH HOLIDAY MAKERS BECAUSE OF FAKE TRAVEL WEBSITE INCREASED FIVEFOLD IN TWELVE MONTHS ACCORDING TO A REPORT IN THE TIMES
THE INCREASE HAS BEEN PARTLY FUELLED BY THE USE OF ACCOMMODATION SHARING WEBSITES WHERE FRAUDSTERS CAN LET OUT NON EXISTENT PROPERTIES THE PAPER SAYS A LARGE NUMBER OF VICTIMS ARE ALSO FALLING PREY TO CON ARTISTS WHO SET UP FAKE AIRLINE TICKET WEBSITE APPARENTLY SELLING CHEAP FARES FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE
