WORTH MENTIONING ANOTHER BRITISH MAN THE SINGER SAM SMITH ALSO WALKED AWAY WITH AN AWARD FOR HIS SONG FOR THE BOND FILM SPECTRE DAVID WILLIS HAS BEEN ON THE RED CARPET IN L.A. AND DAVID GIVE US THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE NIGHT
A GOOD NIGHT FOR A SPOTLIGHT WHICH IS A FILM WITH A GREAT ENSEMBLE CAST THAN ON A FILM THAT MANY HAD THOUGHT WOULD LIFT THE BIG AWARD OF THE NIGHT IF YOU LIKE THAT FOR BEST FILM IT'S THE STORY OF COURSE OF THE BOSTON GLOBES INVESTIGATION INTO THE SEX ABUSE SCANDAL IN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH MANY THOUGHT THE REVERENT MIGHT WIN BECAUSE IT'S BIG BUDGET LOTS OF HYPE SURROUNDING IT BUT THE REMNANT HAD TO MAKE DO WITH BEST DIRECTOR THAT WAS TWO AND ONE HUNDRED
THE SECOND SUCH AWARD IN SUCCESSION HE WON OF COURSE HER LAST YEAR FOR BIRD MAN AND AT THE OSCAR FOR BEST ACTOR WENT TO THE STAR OF THE REVERENT LEONARDO DI CAPRIO THAT WAS THE FIRST ACTOR AT THE FIRST OSCAR OF HIS CAREER AT THE FOURTH TIME OF TRYING MAD MAX FURY ROAD WAS THE

SUPPORTING ACTRESS AWARD WENT EARLIER ON IN THE SHOW TO CAST AND I SHOULD KNOW THAT VIC AND A BIT PUT OFF HER ROLE IN THE DANISH GARCIA PLEASE A DANISH ARTIST ALONGSIDE EDDIE A RED MALE OF COURSE
WE SHOULD DAVID HAVE JUST HAVE A WORD ABOUT THE TONE OF THE WHOLE CEREMONY GIVEN THE ROW IN ADVANCE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS THE LACK OF BLACK FACES AMONG THOSE NOMINATED YES INDEED THE ROW OVER DIVERSITY AND THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IF YOU LIKE A SUBJECT THAT THE HOST THIS YEAR A CHRIS ROCK COULDN'T IGNORE AFTER ONLY WHITE ACTORS WERE NOMINATED FOR THEIR PERFORMANCES FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW HE SAID THE HOLLYWOOD WAS RACIST
HE CAME AT THE ISSUE HEAD ON FROM THE START HE WAS STILL GOING AT IT THREE AND A HALF HOURS LATER HE'S SPREAD HIS BARBS FAIRLY THINLY POKING FUN AS WELL THE BLACK CELEBRITIES WHO'D ACTUALLY CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT OF THIS EVENT AS WELL AS THE ACADEMY ITSELF HE SAID IT ALL CAME DOWN TO OPPORTUNITY WE WANT BLACK ACTORS TO GET THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES NOT JUST ONCE BUT EVERY YEAR LIKE LEONARDO DI CAPRIO
DAVID WILLIS THANKS VERY MUCH FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX COUNCILS IN ENGLAND HAVE WARNED THAT THEIR LEGAL DUTY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD HAS A PLACE IN SCHOOL COULD SOON BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET ROBERT PIGGOTT IS OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT WHAT TOO MANY CHILDREN ROBERT YES TOO MANY CHILDREN JOHN RISING TO THREE POINT THREE MILLION SECONDARY SCHOOL CHILDREN BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THAT'S AN EXTRA HALF A MILLION PLACES NEEDED BY THEN TWENTY PER CENT INCREASE ON CURRENT CAPACITY
SO THIS IS A BULGE IN THE POPULATION OF CHILDREN WHICH IS PASSED THROUGH PRIMARY SCHOOLS AND PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THEM YOU'D PORTAKABINS IN THE PLAYGROUND THAT SORT OF THING AND IS NOW REACHING SECONDARY SCHOOLS THIS SEPTEMBER AND SO THEY ARE WORRYING THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND THOSE PLACES AT THE MOMENT THE CURRENT RULES SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THOSE PIECES IN FREE SCHOOLS
THEY HAVE TO FIND THEM DON'T THEY THEY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEY HAVE TO BE IN FREE SCHOOLS THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN FOR NEW ACADEMIES THEY HAVE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION SAYS THAT THEY MIGHT STRUGGLE TO FIND SPONSORS SEES CHARITIES OR COMPANIES ALL GROUPS OF PARENTS WHO WHO WENT SPONSORED MINCE AND PROVIDE THEM BUT THE LOCAL COUNCILS ALSO WANT TO HAVE THE POWER TO SET UP THEIR OWN SCHOOLS LIKE THEY USED TO BE ABLE TO DO OR TO FORCE ACADEMY SIX NO MAKE UP MORE THAN HALF THE SECRETARIES
TO EXPAND TO MEET THE DEMAND THEMSELVES THE GOVERNMENT SAY THIS IS SCAREMONGERING THEY SAY THEY HAVE SPENT FIVE BILLION POUNDS IN THE RECENT PAST PROVIDING HALF A MILLION PLACES AND THEY'VE GOT SEVEN BILLION TO SPEND IN THE NEXT SIX YEARS SO THEY SAY THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE THE PROBLEM THAT THE COUNCIL SAY IT WASN'T WEIRD DOESN'T IT BECAUSE THERE ARE THERE ARE ENOUGH PLACES
WHERE THERE WERE AT THEIR ANSWERS IT STANDS THIS IS ALL A BETTER PROJECTION WE KNOW THESE CHILDREN ARE COMING TO SECONDARY SCHOOLS IT THE QUESTION IS WILL THE FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM SO PEOPLE LIKE LABOUR ARE SAYING NO IT WON'T IT'S A FIXATION THE GOVERNMENT'S GOT THEY SAY THEY SAY THAT IN FUTURE FEWER CHILDREN COULD GET THEIR FIRST CHOICE OF SCHOOL BUT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT NINETY FIVE PERCENT GOT ONE OF THEIR TOP THREE CHOICES LAST YEAR AND THEY'RE CONFIDENT THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE
BUT THAT'S WHERE THE THE PRESSURE WILL COME WITH PEOPLE HAVING A CHOICE OF WHERE THEY GO TO SCHOOL HOW MUCH CHOICE WE HAVE IN FUTURE LABOUR SAYS THAT ONE IN SIX SECONDS IS ALREADY FULL OR OVER CAPACITY PERHAPS NOT SO SURPRISING GIVEN THAT PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE WHERE THEY WANT TO GO BUT THEY SAY THAT THE PRESSURE IS NOW BECOMING MORE AND MORE INTENSE AND AGAIN IT'S IT REVOLVES AROUND WHETHER THIS FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM WILL WORK THE GOVERNMENT IS CONFIDENT IT WILL
SO MUCH ROBERT SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX AROUND A BILLION RETAIL JOBS OR VANISH BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO SAYS THE BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM IT'S A HEADLINE THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIS MORNING COULD IT BE TRUE JOE LINE AND HE'S HERE WITH THAT AND MORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO YEAH MILLIONS OF US ARE BUYING ONLINE AND SOME ARE STEERING CLEAR OF HIGH STREETS AND THAT IS HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ACCORDING TO THE BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM ANOTHER FACTOR COULD SOON BE THIS
INTRODUCING A NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE
SET IT TO REACH NINE POUNDS AN HOUR BY TWENTY TWENTY THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WILL BE COMPULSORY WORKING PEOPLE AGED TWENTY FIVE AND OVER WILL RECEIVE IT IT WILL START NEXT APRIL AT THE RATE OF SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY
THAT'S THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE LAST JULY ANNOUNCING THE REBRANDING OF THE MINIMUM WAGE AS THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE AND RAISING IT TO SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY FROM APRIL RISING WAGES COULD SEE SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND OF BRITAIN'S TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND SHOPS CLOTHES WITHIN A DECADE ACCORDING TO THE B. R. C. REPORT WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS HELEN DICKINSON IS WITH US THIS MORNING GOOD MORNING HELEN MORNING WELL YOU TRYING TO SCARE THE BEJESUS OUT OF HERE
I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS WHERE WHERE WE'VE TAKEN INPUT FROM WITHIN THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS FROM INDEPENDENT RESEARCH IN WHAT THE REPORT HE'S BASICALLY SAYING IS THAT THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF STRUCTURAL CHANGE ALREADY ON GOING ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY
THERE ARE FEWER PEOPLE THAT WORK IN RETAIL TODAY THAN THEY WERE FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS AGO THERE ARE FEWER SHOPS THAN THERE WERE AND WHAT WE SEE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS IS THIS PACE OF CHANGE ACTUALLY ACCELERATING IN THE MAIN POINT IS NOT ABOUT THEIR EXACT NUMBER BECAUSE IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY FORECAST BUT IT'S ABOUT
HOW THESE CHANGES WILL ACTUALLY LAND IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ECONOMY IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE COUNTRY AND IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF OF THE WORKFORCE IN TERMS OF THOSE PEOPLE
WHO REALLY VALUE LOCAL AND FLEX SO YOU THINK THAT THAT WALES AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND COULD BE ESPECIALLY HIT BY SHOP CLOSURES AND JOB LOSSES IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING WITH THE STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT WE SHOP IS THAT MORE RETAILERS AND INVESTING IN DIGITAL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CONSUMERS WANT
THE ECONOMICS OF RUNNING STORES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE DIFFERENT AND CERTAINLY IF YOU OVERLAY THE LIVING WAGE THEN PAYING
A LIVING WAGE IN LONDON IS GOING TO BE THAT MUCH EASIER BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF THE LIVING WAGE WOULD BE A C. IS NOT AGAINST THEIR NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE CORRECT EVERY CHIEF EXECUTIVE THAT I TALKED HERE WITHIN RETAIL I'M REALLY SUPPORTS THE LIVING WAGE IN PRINCIPLE I THINK THE CHALLENGES FROM A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW IS THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WERE IT WILL HAVE PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOK IN THE LEAD
TO TWENTY TWENTY WHAT IT WILL ACTUALLY MEAN IS THAT THEY ARE SORT OF THE COST BENEFIT EQUATION OF INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY COMPARED TO PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY SHIFT
AND THAT WILL CAUSE MORE INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY WHICH ACTUALLY WILL MAKE THE INDUSTRY MORE EFFICIENT WHICH IS A GOOD THING I DOES EUROPE OR DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THE AVERAGE INDEPENDENT HIGH STREET SHOP IS REALLY UP AGAINST IT BECAUSE AT THE END OF US CONSUMERS USUALLY CHOOSE PRICE IS THE DETERMINING FACTOR FOR SO MANY THINGS ON THE HIGH STREET SHOP THE INDEPENDENT HIGH STREET SHOP WHICH CANNOT SPREAD ITS COSTS ACROSS A WHOLE LOAD OF ITS BUSINESSES CAT REALLY MATCH THE ONLINE OFFERING
WELL I THINK PEOPLE PRICE IS REALLY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT BUT SO IS CONVENIENT SEMI IS THE EXPERIENCE THAT ACTUALLY SHOPPING PROVIDES IT'S NOT JUST A FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY IT'S A LEISURE ACTIVITY AS WELL AND WHAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF HIGH STREET SHOPS IS
IS MUCH MORE ABOUT A REINVENTION IN TERMS OF A DIFFERENT SORT OF EXPERIENCE THAT IS LOCAL TO PEOPLE IN A COMMUNITY AND ACTUALLY BASED ON WHAT IT IS THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR WHETHER THAT IS MORE LEISURE ASPECTS AND MORE EXPERIENCE ASSOCIATED WITH IT
THEN PERHAPS A MORE FUNCTIONAL KIND OF JUST TRANSACTION
O.K. HELEN TICKETS IN THERE FROM THE BRITISH RID HER CONSORT IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALAN HIGGINS IS OUR MARKETS EXPERT TODAY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT COULD BANK GOOD MORNING TO ALAN WHY JOE JUST BRINGIN THAT RETAIL ASPECT RETAIL ACCOUNTS FOR OVER THREE MILLION JOBS IN THE U.K. IS IT IS A CASE THAT WE ARE A LITTLE BIT TOO DEPENDED ON CONSUMPTION THIS COUNTRY AS AN OVERALL PART OF THE ECONOMY
WILL CONSUMPTION DOES DOMINATE THE ECONOMY BUT IT ALSO DOMINATES THE U.S. ECONOMY AND OF COURSE LOOKING FURTHER EAST CHINA WANTS TO GO THE WAY OF CONSUMPTION THEY WANT TO DO WHAT IT WERE TRYING TO GET OUT EXACTLY WELL I WOULD SAY TO EVERY LOOK AT THE MARKET THE TRENDS THAT HELEN MENTIONED IS PARTLY DISCOUNTED IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY RETAILERS UNDER PERFORM FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS HIS RETAIL TRADES AT A HIGHER YIELD
AND WAREHOUSES WHICH USED TO BE OUT OF FAVOUR WHY WAREHOUSES OF COURSE THAT'S WHERE THE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE IN LOGISTICS GOING FORWARD RETURNS SO PROSPECTIVE RETURNS NOW HIGHER AND RETAIL REFLECTING THE RISK OF RETAIL AND SO THE MARKET IS PUTTING A DISCOUNT ON RETAIL BUT YOU MENTIONED WALES WELL IN TERMS OF LOGISTICS SWANSEA HAS A HUGE AMAZON PLANT AT THE SIZE OF TWELVE FOOTBALL FIELDS IN AND THAT'S WHERE THE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE AS OPPOSED TO JUST IN RETAIL
YEP LET'S FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON MERVYN NOW LORD KING HE'S GOT A NEW BOOK OUT AND HE SAID THAT THE RISK OF ANOTHER FINANCIAL CRISIS IS NOW CERTAIN AND MAY COME SOONER RATHER THAN LATER OF COURSE HE WAS IN THE HOT SEAT FOR TEN YEARS AS GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND HE COULD'VE DONE A LOT BUT IT'S QUITE A FOREBODING WARNING
IT IS JOE HE SAID SOON HE DIDN'T SAY WHEN THOUGH DID IT YES AND SOON HE'S QUITE OPEN ENDED YET SO YOU HAVE THE DATE I'D BE RUNNING OUT OF PADDY POWER EXACTLY SO ANOTHER FINANCIAL CRISIS AT THE NATURE OF MARKETS AND ECONOMIES IS TO HAVE FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT'S SADLY THE NATURE OF THE MARKETS AND ECONOMY WERE WE WE LIVE IN WE GET WE TOO MUCH ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE A CORRECTION I WOULD ACTUALLY WE ALSO HAD OVER THE WEEKEND WARREN BUFFETT'S ANNUAL LETTER WHICH WAS A BIT MORE OPTIMISTIC
AND WHAT HE FOCUSED ON IS YES IT'S A LOW GROWTH ENVIRONMENT BUT LOOK AT THAT LOW GROWTH IN THE CONTEXT OF A POPULATION BECAUSE AS WE KNOW GENERAL GENERATES IT TO LOW GROWTH IN POPULATION G.D.P. PER CAPITA BUT TECHNICALLY AND THAT WAS A MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC PICTURE I WOULD SAY WITH MOVING WELL WE'VE HAD A CORRECTION FROM THERE IF YOU LOOK AT THE FOOTSIE FROM SEVEN THOUSAND TO YOU
WAY BELOW SIX BACK OVER SIX THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND THE U.K.'S AND OUTPERFORM PERFORMER THIS YEAR COMPARED TO OTHER MARKETS AND WE GO MORE WITH WARREN RATHER THAN YOUR SLIGHTLY MORE GLASS HOW FALL IN THIS CASE THE FOOTY BEING BACK OVER SIX THOUSAND IS THAT AS A SIGN THAT THE CRISIS WE SAW IN THE FIRST SIX WEEKS ON THE MARKETS IS OVER
WE PUT IS A FINANCIAL CRISIS RATHER AN ECONOMIC CRISIS ECONOMIC DATA THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED GENERALLY IS CONSISTENT WITH JUST A SLOW DOWN RATHER THAN A RECESSION SO KIND OF THE NARRATIVE IS THIS IS A BIT MORE LIKE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE ALSO HAD A MINI FINANCIAL CRISIS RESOLVING AROUND GREECE THIS IS A MINI FINANCIAL CRISIS RESOLVING AROUND MAINLY ENERGY AND ENERGY COMPANIES GOING BUST BUT WE DIDN'T GO INTO RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND WE DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO RECESSION THIS YEAR
ALAN HAD SEVERAL COOS BANK THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THEIR RESEARCH FROM T.S.B. HAS FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE PERSONAL DEATH EXCLUDING MORTGAGES AND STUDENT LOANS NOW STANDS AT THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT POUNDS NEARLY HALF OF THAT IS OWED TO CREDIT CARD COMPANIES WORRYINGLY THE DAYS ALSO SHOWS THAT NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE INTEREST RATE ON THE CREDIT CARD OVERDRAFT OR PERSONAL LOAN
THEY CAN'T BE SURE EXACTLY HOW MUCH INTEREST THERE ACTUALLY BEING CHARGED EVERY MONTH NICK SMITH IS HEAD OF PERSONAL LOANS OR T.S.B. SPEAK GOOD MORNING TO YOU NICK MORNING SO WHAT SHOULD WE GLEAN FROM YOUR RESEARCH THAT PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED MUCH FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE RECESSION AND THEY'VE GONE
BACK TO USING THEIR CREDIT CARDS WELL I THINK IT'S LESS ABOUT HOW THEY USING CREDIT CARDS ALTHOUGH THE RESEARCH DID THROW UP SOME INTERESTING EXAMPLES WHERE WHERE PEOPLE REGRETTED SOME OF THE SPENDING BUT ACTUALLY THE START THAT YOU TOUCHED ON JOE WAS THE ONE THAT WORRIED ME THE MOST THAT TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE INTEREST RATE YOU'RE PAYING IF YOU THINK HOW MUCH YOU PAYING NICK ON YOUR OVERDRAFT
I DON'T HAVE AN OVERDRAFT AND WHY THEY HAVE AN OVERDRAFT BUT I'M NOT IN IT AT THE MINUTE AND IF I'M HONEST I DON'T KNOW MY INTEREST O.K. SO YOU'RE ONE OF THE TWO THIRDS I AM ONE OF THE TWO THIRDS IT'S GOOD TO BE IN THE MAJORITY SOMETIMES BUT I THINK FOR ME IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT WILL MAKE DRIVING A COUPLE OF MILES OUT OF THE WAY TO FIND TO GET TWO P. OFF A LITRE OF A LITRE OF FUEL AT THE PETROL PUMP AND YET MANY PEOPLE AREN'T TAKING TEN MINUTES TO GET THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OUT TO SIT DOWN WITH A PEN AND PAPER AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE
AND WORK OUT WHETHER THEY'RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE BORING THEY HAVE OH KAY I THINK ARE WE BORROWING MORE AN UNSECURED CREDIT NOW THAN WE WERE PRE CRISIS
NOT COMPARED TO PRE CRISIS NO SO WE ARE SEEING UNSECURED CREDIT GROWING BUT IT'S NOT THE LEVELS THAT IT WAS PRE CRISIS I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND WE LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IS HELPING PEOPLE TO TO TO BORROW WELL IS MAKING SURE THAT WHAT YOU'RE BORROWING IS AFFORDABLE SO
WORK OUT PLAN WHAT YOU'RE SPENDING EACH MONTH THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR INCOME IS AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT OVERSTRETCHING WITHIN WITHIN THAT BUFFER WE'VE SPOKEN A LOT OF A RETAIL SPENDING THEIR SPAWNING A LOT OF YOUR CUSTOMERS WILL BE USING THEIR CREDIT CARDS AND THE OVERDRAFTS ECCENTRIC SETTER TO BUY STUFF WHICH WOULD BE URGING HIM TO BUY A LITTLE BIT LESSON EFFECT TO HELEN'S CLIENTS A LOT MORE
I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT URGING PEOPLE TO TO TO TO BUY LESS TO SPEND LESS I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT SPENDING SPENDING WISELY I MEAN WE WE ARE STAR TWO THOUSAND CUSTOMERS THAT WE THAT WE SPOKE TO ABOUT
AND ANY PURCHASES THAT HE REGRETTED IN ONE SHOP MENTIONED BY NAME A VINTAGE NINETEEN FIFTIES DOUBLE DECKER BUS NOW I DON'T THINK THAT'S I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HURT ANY OF HELEN'S CLIENTS BUT THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL DID REGRET IT AND HE BOUGHT IT ON HIS CREDIT CARD HE BOUGHT AN ICE CREDIT CARD LOOK AT THAT THAT'S THE EXCEPTION OBVIOUSLY IT MOST PEOPLE DON'T BUY A DOUBLE DECKER BUSES AND PUT IN THE FRONT DRIVE WHAT WHAT WOULD WHAT ARE YOU RECOMMENDING THE PEOPLE THEY CONSOLIDATE THEIR DEBTS INTO ONE EASY PAYMENT
IT DOES SOUND A BIT OF A CLICHE BUT ACTUALLY IT IS A REALLY GOOD WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT YOU CAN BE DEBT FREE AND ONE OF THINGS WE THOUGHT ABOUT WAS WILL TODAY'S THE TWENTY NINTH OF FEBRUARY NO LEAP YEARS COME AROUND ONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS FOUR YEARS IS A REALLY REALISTIC TIME FRAME FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BE DEBT FREE TO DO IT SO ACTUALLY I'M KIND OF I WANTED TO WISH YOU A BIT OF A CALL TO ARMS AND SAY TO PEOPLE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO PROPOSE ON AIR TO STOP NO I'M ALREADY MARRIED VERY HAPPILY MARRIED
BUT I THINK A ELITE YEARS RESOLUTION WHAT A GREAT IDEA TO SAY IF YOU WANT TO BE DEBT FREE PLAN TO BE DEBT FREE IN FOUR YEARS' TIME COS IT'S IT'S EMINENTLY MANAGEABLE SUPER THAT'S GREAT THAT'S NICK SMITH FROM T. S. B. THANKS TO ALAN AND THANKS TO HELEN AS WELL THANK YOU

TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN HOSPITALS ARE FACING SUCH A SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF NURSES AND DOCTORS THEY'RE HAVING TO RECRUIT ABROAD TO FILL THE GAP BY HEALTH CORRESPONDENT IS DOMINIC DOMINIC WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING WE HAVE A BIT MORE DETAIL ON IT
WE DO JOHN WE SENT FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST TO EVERY ACUTE HOSPITAL IN A BIG HOSPITAL TRUST IN ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND TO GET A PICTURE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE ON THE FIRST OF DECEMBER LAST YEAR WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT IN ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND THEY WERE MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND NURSING VACANCIES THAT'S AROUND NINE PER CENT
OF THE WORKFORCE THERE WERE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND DOCTOR POSTS THAT WERE VACANT IN HOSPITALS THAT'S SEVEN PER CENT OF THE TOTAL WE TRIED TO GET FIGURES FOR SCOTLAND CAN GET COMPARABLE FIGURES SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO INCLUDE THEM IN OUR SAMPLE BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT MANY HOSPITALS
ARE IN THE ENGLAND PARTICULARLY ARE HAVING TO RELY ON EXPENSIVE AGENCY STAFF TO MAKE UP THE SHORTFALL BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE CARE QUALITY COMMISSION WATCHDOG FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE MORE NURSES ON WARDS AND THAT USE OF THOSE AGENCY STAFF IS DRIVING A FINANCIAL CRISIS A GROWING FINANCIAL CRISIS WITHIN THE HEALTH SERVICE
ONE SOLUTION THEY'VE COME UP WITH IS TO RECRUIT FROM ABROAD AND OUR FIGURES THAT DO INCLUDE SCOTLAND SO THIS IS FOR THE WHOLE U.K. SHOW THAT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF TRUSTS AND HEALTH BOARDS RIGHT ACROSS THE U.K. AT ACTIVELY SEEKING STAFF OVERSEAS OR MANY OF THEM ARE TRAVELLING AS FAR AFIELD AS INDIA AND THE PHILIPPINES AND I SUPPOSE
WE SHOULD SAY AT THIS POINT THAT IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR DOCTORS FROM OVERSEAS TO COME AND WORK IN THE N.H.S. IN THE U.K. THAT'S HAPPENED PRETTY MUCH SINCE THE N.H.S. WAS FOUNDED BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A CAN A GROWING AND CONTINUING CRISIS
WITH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF STAFF WITHIN THE N.H.S. AND WHEN DOCTORS COME HERE FROM OVERSEAS TO THEY TEND TO STAY IN WHICH CASE PRESUMABLY IT ISN'T A PROBLEM ONLY CLUE BUT PUTTING ASIDE WHETHER THEY'RE NEEDED IN THE COUNTRIES FROM WHICH THEY HAVE COME BUT IS IT A PARTICULAR PROBLEM IF YOU HAVE FOREIGN DOCTORS SO I CAN DO THE JOB PROPERLY AND THEY'RE HAPPY TO STAY
NO I DON'T I DON'T THINK I DON'T MEAN THAT IS AN ISSUE I MEAN THERE ARE NOW MUCH MORE STRINGENT LANGUAGE TESTS THEM ALL N.H.S. STAFF HAVE TO PASS FOR EXAMPLE AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO GO THROUGH VERY STRINGENT CLINICAL TEST SO BASICALLY THEY ALMOST SUCKED SOME OF THEM HAVE TO READ THAT THOSE DOCTORS OUTSIDE OF THE PARTICULARLY AFTER
AND NURSES AS WELL HAVE TO RE VALIDATE IF YOU LIKE THEIR QUALIFICATIONS SO THEY DO GO THROUGH VERY STRINGENT TESTS NOW BEFORE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO WORK IN THE N.H.S. I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT IS A PARTICULAR ISSUE I THINK THE INTERESTING THING IS WHERE THESE SHORTAGES ARE OCCURRING SO FOR EXAMPLE
SPECIFIC AREAS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHICH THEY'D FIND IT VERY HARD TO FILL REGISTERED NURSES IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS EMERGENCY MEDICINE CONSULTANTS
PROVING VERY DIFFICULT TO FILL AND THAT SHINES IT VERY MUCH WITH THE SORT OF THINGS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE THE BODY THAT REPRESENTS DOCTORS IN ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY THEY'RE SAYING IT'S VERY HARD TO RECRUIT STAFF AND ALSO PAEDIATRIC CONSULTANT WE SAW THAT THERE ARE ABOUT SEVEN PER CENT POST VACANT IN PAEDIATRICS SO THERE ARE THE SPECIFIC AREAS ARE FINDING IT HARD TO RECRUIT AND WE'LL BE LOOKING AT IT IN MORE DETAIL AT TEN PAST EIGHT DOMINIC THANKS VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD LEAD TO A DECADE OF UNCERTAINTY ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY SAY WILL BE PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS OVER OUR NEW RELATIONSHIPS ARE NORMAN SMITH IS UP ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NONE OF THIS IS THE LATEST REPORT ON
HOW IN THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO LEAVE THE E.U. IT'S AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENT PUBLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT HAVE SAID FAIRLY BRACING DOCUMENT SHALL WE SAY END THAT HE'D SUGGEST IT WOULD TAKE US MORE THAN TEN YEARS TO FINALLY EXTRICATE OURSELVES AND SET UP NEW RELATIONSHIPS IF WE LEFT THE E.U. IT SAYS THE CURRENT PROPOSED TIMETABLE OF TWO YEARS IS UNREALISTIC TWO YEARS WOULD SIMPLY BE IF YOU LIKE THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO GET OUT
OF THE E.U. BUILT WOULDN'T ESTABLISH NEW RELATIONSHIPS WHICH WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON REACHING AGREEMENT WITH ALL TWENTY SEVEN OTHER FORMER E.U. COLLEAGUES WITH SOME OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS WITH THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND OTHER WORDS THAT COULD DRAG ON FOR EVER AND A DAY AND ON TOP OF THAT NEGOTIATING NEW TRADE DEALS WITH NON E.U. COUNTRIES THAT WOULD
PROBABLY BE PUT ON HOLD WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES WAITED TO SEE WHAT AN EARTH OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS WITH THE E. U. DURING WHICH TIME IT IS CLAIMED THERE WOULD BE A. HUGE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR THE BRITISH ECONOMY MORE THAN THAT THEY WOULD BE A QUESTION MARK IT'S CLAIMED ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE TWO MILLION BRITS LIVING IN E.U. COUNTRIES WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEIR RIGHTS IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO BENEFITS PENSIONS AND THEIR FREEDOM TO MOVE TO WORK EXCEPT
THERE WOULD BE A QUESTION MARK ABOUT THE FISHING INDUSTRY COULD FISHERMEN HAVE ACCESS TO E.U. WATERS THERE'D BE A QUESTION MARK FOR TRAVELLERS WERE WE GET ACCESS CONTINUED ACCESS TO THE HEALTH INSURANCE PASSPORT SO ON AND SO FORTH AND NOT SURPRISINGLY OF COURSE CRITICS HAVE SAID WELL THIS IS ALL PART OF
PROJECT FEAR DESIGNED TO SCARE THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF US FROM LEAVING THE E.U. AND INTERESTINGLY SERRA WE HERE TODAY FROM ONE ON MY CAMERA INSIDE EQUALLY CRITICAL ABOUT THE TONE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND DAD ARE SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON WHO IN HER FIRST INTERVENTION MAJOR INTERVENTION IN THIS CAMPAIGN WILL APPEAL TO MY CAMERA TO ADOPT MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
POSITIVE OPTIMISTIC TONE TO THIS CAMPAIGN OR OTHERWISE RISK ALIENATING VOTERS THERE HAS BEEN QUITE A BIT OF ROW OVER THEM JUST THE WHOLE WAY THIS IS GOING AS WELL AS THE CONTENT NOT LEAST WITH ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT PAPERS
THERE IS AN ONGOING ROW OVER THE STIPULATION BY SIR JEREMY HAYWARD THE CABINET SECRETARY THAT SEVERAL BRECHT'S AT MINISTERS SHOULD NOT GET ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS WHICH RELATE TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM NOW UM THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAY THIS IS BEING OVER INTERPRETED IT IS UNFAIR THAT THE DOCUMENTS THEY ARE BEING
RESTRICTED ACCESS TO GOES MORE WIDELY THAN THAT THE RESPONSE OF GOVERNMENT TO SAY HANG ON WE ALL SIGNED UP TO THIS THE CABINET SIGNED UP TO THIS BEFORE THE REFERENDUM AND BY THE WAY THERE IS A GOVERNMENT POSITION NAMELY TO BE IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THE E.U. IT WOULD MAKE NO SENSE TO GIVE MINISTERS WHO ARE CAMPAIGNING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT POSITION ACCESS TO THOSE PAPERS I MEAN MY SENSES THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN ON THIS IT IS A SOMEWHAT GREY AREA I THINK IN THE SENSE IF YOU TAKE SOMETHING LIKE
FOR EXAMPLE THE DEAL NEGOTIATED BY MISTER CAMERON ON BENEFIT KERBS NOW YOU COULD SAY THAT IS ABOUT THE REFERENDUM CLEARLY FOR SOME LIKE IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AT CENTRAL TO THE WORK OF HIS DEPARTMENT ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW THEY WOULD INTRODUCE THAT SO IT'S A SLIGHTLY GREY AREA BUT I THINK THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO STICK TO IT NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY TO SEVEN ONE OF THE VERTICALS MOST SENIOR OFFICIALS HAS BEEN GIVING EVIDENCE TO AN INQUIRY INTO CHILD ABUSE HE'S CARDINAL GEORGE PELLEAS PART OF WHAT HE SAID
I'M NOT HERE TO DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE THAT CHURCH AS MY ANNOYANCE OF THANKS
HE'S WORKING A REMEDY THOSE MAP THAT CHURCHES IN MANY PLACES CERTAINLY IN AUSTRALIA HAS MUCKED THINGS UP
AND OUR CORRESPONDENT IN ROME IS JAMES REYNOLDS JAMES HE WAS GIVING EVIDENCE FROM ROME TO A TRIBUNAL IN AUSTRALIA THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE HE SAID THAT HE WAS TOO FRAIL TO MAKE THE JOURNEY ALL THE WAY FROM HERE TO AUSTRALIA SO INSTEAD THE COMMISSION SAID ALL RIGHT YOU CAN GIVE EVIDENCE VIA VIDEO LINK THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT HE HAD TO DO IT ALL AUSTRALIA TIME SO HE STARTED AT TEN IN THE EVENING AND ENDED AT TWO IN THE MORNING
BUT THERE WAS AN INTAKE OF BREATH I I FELT IN THE HOTEL BALLROOM WHEN HE MADE THOSE WORDS IT CAME FAIRLY EARLY ON AND SURVIVORS OF CHILD ABUSE HAVE ABUSED BY PRIESTS LATER ON SAID THEY APPRECIATED IS CONSIDERED RUDE TONE SO IS THAT IT NO HE'S GOT TO COME BACK TO
FOR TWO MORE DAYS TONIGHT AND TOMORROW POSSIBLY A THIRD NIGHT AS WELL TO GIVE A LOT MORE EVIDENCE THEY ONLY REALLY TALKED ABOUT THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES LAST NIGHT ABOUT HIS TIME AS A YOUNG PRIEST IN EASTERN AUSTRALIA DID HE KNOW THAT SEVERAL OF HIS FELLOW PRIESTS WERE ABUSING CHILDREN CARD ON PELLE SAID HE'D HEARD RUMOURS BUT HAD NO DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR CRIMES WHERE MIGHT IT GO THIS TRIBUNAL OR IS IT SIMPLY A QUESTION I SAY SIMPLY IT'S IMPORTANT CLEARLY GIVE ESTABLISHING THE FACTS AND THEN THAT'S IT
FACTS AND THEN FOLLOW UP BY DETECTIVES ESSENTIALLY THIS IS AN ENQUIRY NOT JUST INTO ACTIONS BY CATHOLIC CHURCH PRIESTS BUT ACTIONS BY INSTITUTIONS IN AUSTRALIA OVER RECENT DECADES SCOUTS AND OTHER PRIVATE ORGANISATIONS AS WELL ARE INVOLVED THERE WILL BE CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS ONE WOULD IMAGINE ONCE THE REPORTERS OUT IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEENTH AND ONE IMAGINES A GREAT DEAL OF ANGER IN AUSTRALIA
A HUGE AMOUNT OF MORE THAN A DOZEN VICTIMS SURVIVORS OF ABUSE BY PRIESTS RAISED MONEY TO GET TO THE TRACK TO GET TO THE HEARING IN ROME THEY DIDN'T WANT TO WATCH CARDINAL PALE VIA VIDEO LINK BY FUZZY VIDEO LINK IN AUSTRALIA THEY WANTED TO BE HERE AND EVERY TIME THERE WAS A BREAK IN PROCEEDINGS THEY SPOKE TO REPORTERS THEY SAID THERE WAS A LONG WAY TO GO TOWARDS TRUTH AND THEY KNOW THAT CARDINAL PELL THOUGH HAS OFFERED TO MEET THEM IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS JAMES THANK YOU VERY MUCH

A BIOGRAPHY OF TONY BLAIR BY THE INVESTIGATED JOURNALIST TOM WHO'S WRITTEN A LOT OF STUFF WITH THESE SORTS OF BOOKS TODAY IT ACCUSES HIM OF DECIDING IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO ON THE NEED FOR REGIME CHANGE IN IRAQ WHILE PRETENDING TO BE AN HONEST BROKER SEEKING A PEACEFUL SOLUTION
THE MAIL SAYS ACCORDING TO BAR THIS WAS A DECEPTION IT MEANT THE MILITARY WERE UNABLE TO BEGIN PROPER PLANNING FOR THE IRAQ WAR A SPOKESMAN FOR MISTER BLAIR HAS SAID THAT NONE OF THE ALLIGATORS ARE NEW AND ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN REBUTTED IN EVIDENCE TO THE VARIOUS INQUIRIES AND FIND IT'S NOT JUST AS A NEW DAY THAT'S FEELING UPBEAT AND GLASS HALF FULL
THE BABY BOOMER GENERATION ARE ALSO BEING PRETTY CHIPPER AS THEY AGE AT LEAST THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL SURVEY FOR HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS FOLLOWED THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE SINCE THEY WERE BORN IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX THEY ARE SAID TO BE FEELING MORE CHEERFUL AS THEY APPROACH SEVENTY THAN THEY DID AT SIXTY DESPITE MOST REPORTING AT LEAST ONE COMMON CHRONIC DISEASE AS THE TIMES PUTS IT BAD BACKS ARTHRITIS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR NO BARRIER TO HAPPINESS ACCOMPANYING CARTOON HAS AN ELDERLY GENT GLARING I'M ECSTATIC BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHY
THAT IT'S THE COURT TO THE MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING A NEW FIGURES PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF THE STUFFING SHORTAGES IN THE N.H.S. AND THE EXTENT OF ATTEMPTS TO RECRUIT OVERSEAS
OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS A MAN IN RAKKA IN SYRIA HAS BEEN KEEPING A DIARY FOR US A RECORD OF WHAT LIFE IS LIKE UNDER SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE HIS MEDIA ACTIVIST WITH A GROUP CALLED AL CHUCKIE ARE TWENTY FOUR AND WE'LL BE RUNNING HIS REPORT EVERY DAY THIS WEEK FOR HIS OWN SAFETY WE CHANGED A FEW DETAILS OF HIS STORY AND ASKED AN ACTOR TO VOICE UP HIS WORDS IT CANNOT HAD GATHERED ON THE DE PAUL
CROUCHED INSIDE IT WAS A WOMAN I ASKED PEOPLE WHO SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING THERE BEFORE I GOT AN ANSWER A LARGE MAST MAN BEGAN READING THIS WOMAN WAS ADULTEROUS AND HER PUNISHMENT IS TO BE STONED TO DEATH
HIS WORDS WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE NOISE OF FOUR PLANES OVERHEAD IT LORCAN VENDOR SHOUTED HIDE HIDE
THERE WERE BIG EXPLOSIONS AND BODY PARTS EVERYWHERE BUT OUR CORRESPONDENT MIKE THOMPSON PUT THOSE REPORTS TOGETHER FOR US THAT MIGHT TELL US ABOUT THIS MAN FIRST OF ALL WHO YEARS HE'S HE'S YOUNG MAN AND BELONGS TO A SMALL ACTIVIST GROUP IN THE RACK OTHERS SEVERAL OF THOSE AND THIS GROUP WAS FORMED IN LATE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN AND ITS MAIN AIM IS TO TRY AND EXPOSE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT UNDER EYE IN RATTUS AND THEIR RAFFIA AREA
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO BECAUSE ANYONE WHO SPEAKS TO THE WESTERN MEDIA RECEIVES A PUNISHMENT OF DEATH IF CAUGHT AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO LEAVE WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM MY S. AND THAT'S EXTREMELY HARD TO GET SO WE THOUGHT THAT THESE DIARIES WERE A REALLY GOOD WAY OF ENABLING HIM TO TELL HIS STORY O.K. WHAT WHAT WOULD USE WHAT WE TAKE FROM IT WHAT SORT OF
COMES ACROSS MOST PERFECTLY WELL IT'S THE WAY THAT BRUTALITY PERMEATES JUST ABOUT EVERY AREA OF LIFE AND YOU SEE IT ON THE SIDE OF THE SCALE WE CAN RELATE TO TO HIT TO HIS FAMILY TO HIS FRIENDS TO HIS COMMUNITY WE SEE THINGS LIKE HOW PEOPLE ARE BEING EXECUTED IN THE STREETS WE HEADED FOR THINGS LIKE ADULTERY SPEAKING TO THE WESTERN MEDIA OR BEEN PERCEIVED TO HAVE LINKS WITH ENEMIES OF ART YES
RIGHT THROUGH TO WOMEN WHO DON'T COVER UP CAN RECEIVE LASHINGS OR COMPULSORY CHERIE OR COURSES AND EVEN THEN WHOSE TROUSERS ARE TOO LONG A DIARY SPEAKS OF A MAN WHOSE TROUSERS WERE BELOW THE ANKLE AND THEY SHOULD BE A COOK CALLING TO I S. ABOVE THE ANKLE
WE ALSO FIND OUT ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE WAY THAT TAXES LEVELLED BUT LEVIED BY I HAVE MADE IT VERY HARD FOR MANY FAMILIES TO A FORWARD TO GET FOOD ON THE TABLE THERE'S BEEN A BAN ON THE SALE OF TELEVISION IN SHOPS AND
IT'S A SITUATION WHERE MANY PEOPLE ARE JUST STRUGGLING TO COPE AND THE BIGGEST THING THAT I DO TAKE FROM THIS IS THE EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE OF A DIARIST WHO HAS RISKED EVERYTHING TO BRING US THE DIARIES WILL BE HEARING THIS WEEK COS IT IS THAT WE ARE HERE SO LITTLE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF JACK MELISSA MOST OBVIOUS THINGS THAT YES SO THE IDEA OF THESE ARE WHICH IS WHY THEY SORT OF CITIZEN JOURNALISTS HAVE SPRUNG UP ANYBODY JUST GETTING ANY INFORMATION OUT ABOUT LIFE IS EXTRAORDINARY
IT IS AND JUST BE ABLE TO HAVE A POP AND BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE TO SOMEWHERE THAT SO CLOSED OFF AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE HORROR OF IT DAY BY DAY IS SOMETHING REALLY QUITE UNIQUE O. K. WE'RE GONNA BE RUNNING THOSE HE'S HIS REPORTS HIS DIARIES OF VOICE UP AS WE SAY FOR HIS OWN SAFETY AT TWENTY TO EIGHT EACH DAY THIS WEEK WE'VE ALSO HAD AN ANIMATOR SCOTT QUELLO PRODUCE AN ANIMATED VERSION OF IT WHICH IF YOU GO TO OUR WEBSITE THE ADDRESS B.B.C. DOCK HEAD
K. FOURTEEN ASH TODAY YOU CAN CLICK ON THE LINK AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT THE SHORT FILM OF HIS HIS DIARY LIKE THOMPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW PLANS ARE ANNOUNCED TODAY TO DOUBLE THE SIZE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY HYDRO POWER SCHEME THAT CREATES AND STORES ENERGY THE PLANT NEAR OBAN IN SCOTLAND PUMPS WATER UPHILL AT NIGHT WHEN ENERGY PRICES FROM WIND FARMS ARE CHEAP THEN LETS THE WATER THE HILL IN THE DAYTIME TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY WHEN DEMAND PEAKS AND POWER PRICES ARE EXPENSIVE FIRM SAYS IT WILL HELP
THE U.K. TACKLE THE MASSIVE CHALLENGE OF CREATING ALL OUR ENERGY WITHOUT POLLUTING FOSSIL FUELS OUR ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY ANALYST ROGER HAVE BEEN REPORTS
AND WALKING IN DEEP SNOW NEAR A MAN MADE LAKE IN THE SCOTTISH HILLS BY OVER
BEFORE ME IS A STEEP SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN
TO MY LEFT THERE'S A CONCRETE DAM I'M BELOW ME FAR BELOW ME
IS A PROJECT TO CREATE AND STORE ENERGY ON A TRULY HEROIC SCALE
I'M AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN NOW AT THE EDGE
WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN EXTREMELY LONG AND VERY WET DRIPPING TUNNEL AND THE GATES ARE OPENING TO LET US
ONLY TO LATER AND WE'RE INSIDE THE BELLY OF THE MOUNTAIN
IN A CAVERN BIG ENOUGH TO SWALLOW A CATHEDRA
THIS IS CRUACHAN HYDROPOWER STATION THAT DOWN WE SAW EARLIER IS A QUARTER OF A MILE ABOVE OUR HEADS ROSS GALBRAITH IS FROM SCOTTISH
STANDING ON THE TURBINE HALL CURRENTLY
ALL THE WATER COMING FROM THE UPPER RESERVOIR WHICH TONS OF TURBINES TO GENERATE THE ELECTRICITY
BUT THIS IS NO ORDINARY HYDRO STATION IT GENERATES ELECTRICITY ONLY AT TIMES OF PEAK DEMAND WHEN THE PRICE IS HIGHEST
AT NIGHT TIME THIS SYSTEM USES CHEAP ELECTRICITY TO PUMP THE WATER BAG UPHILL TO THE RESERVOIR TO POWER THE TURBINES WHEN DEMAND PIGS AGAIN NEXT DAY
ROSS'S BOSS NEIL CLITHEROE WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO HELP EXPAND THIS POWER STATION TO COPE WITH THE INCREASE IN INTERMITTENT WIND
THIS PUMP STORAGE SYSTEM IS A REALLY USEFUL AS WE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF WIND ENERGY WE HAVE AS WE INSTALL MORE WIND FARMS BECAUSE WE CAN USE THE WIND ENERGY TO PUMP THE WATER UP THE HILL WHEN THERE'S NO WIND WE CAN RELEASE THE ENERGY CUSTOMERS USE IT THERE MAKING THE MOST OF INTERMITTENT RENEWABLES IS JUST ONE ELEMENT OF THE ENERGY REVOLUTION FACING THE U.K.
TO MEET PROMISES ON CLIMATE CHANGE WE ALSO NEED MUCH MORE CLEAN ELECTRICITY TO POWER OUR CARS AND HEAT OUR HOMES WILL ALSO HAVE TO RENEW LARGE PARTS OF THE AGEING ELECTRICITY GRID
THAT IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE IF YOU PUT THAT GRID END TO END IT RUNS FROM HERE TO THE MOON AND
PHIL TAYLOR IS PROFESSOR OF POWER SYSTEMS AT NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY HE SAYS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO RENEW THE GRID COMPLETELY AND WE HAVEN'T GOT THE TIME SO WE HAVE TO THINK AFRESH
RATHER THAN BUILD MORE AND MORE ALL THE HEADLINES AND CABLES AND TRANSFORMERS WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO DELIVER THE LOW CARBON TRANSITION BY BEING LESS DEPENDENT ON BIG INFRASTRUCTURE AND MORE DEPENDENT ON FLEXIBILITY CONTROL ENERGY
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE IN THE CORNER OF PHIL TAYLOR'S LAB IS A WEB ENABLED SMART WASHING MACHINE
WHEN DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY IS LOW OR COMPUTER SIMULATING THE GRID TURNS ON THE WASHING MACHINE TO BENEFIT FROM CHEAP ELECTRICITY
IN COMING YEARS OUR FRIDGES AND FREEZERS WILL BE TURNED OFF TEMPORARILY BY NATIONAL GRID COMPUTERS
TO SAVE ENERGY AT TIMES OF PEAK DEMAND
SMART APPLIANCES DEMAND MANAGEMENT ENERGY STORY
THE INTERNET OF ENERGY
EXPERTS SAY ALL THIS IS OUR FUTURE BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO FRAME POLICIES TO MAKE IT
ROGER HAVE BEEN REPORTING IT SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IT IS BUDGET DAY IN INDIA AND THE ENGINE FUDGE IT MATTERS TO US ALL THESE DAYS BECAUSE THE WORLD NOW LOOKS TO INDIA'S AN IMPORTANT ENGINE OF GROWTH BUT CAN THE BOOM CONTINUE WHEN THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT'S KEY IMPORTANT ECONOMIC REFORMS ARE BLOCKED BY PARLIAMENT ON SOUTH ASIA CORRESPONDENT JUST ROLL IT IS IN THE INDIAN CAPITAL DELHI GOOD JUSTIN
GOOD MORNING I CERTAINLY AM IN THE IN CAPITAL AND YOU COULD PROBABLY HEAR THE TRAFFIC ALL AROUND ME DELIS TERRIBLE CONGESTION IS EVIDENCE OF THE ECONOMIC BUZZ THERE IS HERE IN INDIA BUT ALSO OF THE CHALLENGES OF KEEPING THIS PLACE
GROWING AS I SPEAK THE FINANCE MINISTER ARRAN JAKE IS OUTLINING HOW HE PLANS TO DO THAT TO KEEP INDIA GROWN HE'S DELIVERING HIS THIRD BUDGET IN THE INDIAN PARLIAMENT HE'S ALREADY SAYS IT SET IT WILL BE
GROWTH BOOSTING BUT THERE ARE NO SHORTAGE OF OBSTACLES HE NEEDS TO NEGOTIATE THOSE STALLED STALLED ECONOMIC REFORMS YOU MENTIONED IT JUST ONE BUT IT'S GOT TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN INCREASING GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND THE NEED TO CUT THE DEFICIT ONE OF HIS HEADLINE PLEDGES TODAY HAS BEEN FIVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS
TO BOOST THE INCOMES OF STRUGGLING FARMERS MEANWHILE HE SAID THE STAGNANT WORLD ECONOMY PRETTY MUCH RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPORT LED GROWTH
YESTERDAY I MANAGED TO GRAB A FEW MOMENTS WITH ONE OF MY JAKE THESE KEY COUNCILLORS THE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ARVIND SABRA MAN IAN FIRST OFF
I PUT A STAGGERING STATISTIC ABOUT THE INDIAN ECONOMY TO HIM THE FACT BUT A MILLION PEOPLE JOINED THE WORKFORCE EVERY MONTH A MILLION NEW WORKERS EVERY SINGLE MONTH SO WHAT CAN THE INDIAN FINANCE MINISTER DO TO ENSURE THERE IS WORK
FOR THE MORE THAT ONE MILLION NUMBER IS A LITTLE BIT MISLEADING OR KIND OF DECEPTIVE BECAUSE WE CREATE A LOT OF INFORMAL SECTOR JOB BEING LOW PRODUCTIVITY I WOULD ARGUE THE CHALLENGES
AS MUCH ABOUT CREATING GOOD QUALITY GOOD JOBS RATHER THAN JUST CREATING MORE JOBS BUT THE MANUFACTURING SPACE IS NOW TAKEN BY CHINA IS THE SPACE FOR INDIA TO GROW MANUFACTURING IN THE WAY THAT YOU TALK ABOUT GROWING WELL NOW THE INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT IS THAT CHINA'S VACATING THAT MANUFACTURING SPACE BECAUSE WAGES HAVE GONE UP SO MUCH THAT THEY'RE NOT COMPETITIVE ANY MORE WE SHOULD BE EMINENTLY PLEASED TO ATTRACT MANY OF THOSE MANUFACTURING SECTOR JOBS
FOX GONE WHICH IS IT MAJOR TAIWANESE COMPANY MAJOR BIG EMPLOYEE CHINA MASSIVE EMPLOYS A MACH A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DIED IF I'VE GOT A HUGE COMPANY HAVE GOT TO INDIA AND THEY'VE ALREADY SET UP SHOP IN THREE STATES AND THERE HE IS TO ACHIEVE
MAYBE DOCTOR IDENTICAL SCARED THAT THEY ACHIEVED IN CHINA BUT SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT AND IF SIMON TEDIOUSLY DOVE WOULD STATE GOVERNMENTS RESPOND BY MAKING THINGS EASIER IN TERMS OF LABOUR LAWS HE'S OF DOING BUSINESS SOMETHING NOT EXACTLY LIKE THE CHINESE MODEL SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT I'VE GOT A CHALLENGE YORK THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE WHICH IS THAT CHINA'S VACATING THE MANUFACTURING SPACE IT'S NOT WAGES HAVE GONE UP WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS
BRINGING IN MACHINES ROBOTS TO MANUFACTURE THINGS EVEN MORE EFFICIENTLY IN CHINA TECHNOLOGY SLOW THE PACE AT WHICH THOSE JOBS ARE LEAVING HIS RAGES AND INDIA ARE GOING TO BE YOU KNOW TWENTY PERCENT GOES IN CHINA WILL BE GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE THEY KNOCK WHEN WELL ECONOMY PICKS UP AGAIN WE WILL HAVE ESTABLISHED A COMPETITIVE LOW COST BASE FROM WHICH TO SERVICE WORLD MARKET BUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO DO THAT
HIS REFORM THE INDIAN ECONOMY MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO DO BUSINESS HERE BLOODY LISTENERS WILL BE AMAZED THAT THERE ISN'T AN INTERNAL MARKET IN INDIA THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE IMPOSES ITS OWN TAXES AND FOR EXAMPLE A TRUCK MOVING ACROSS INDIA OFTEN WOULD HAVE TO STOP AT EVERY SINGLE STATE BORDER I THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE A BIG IMPACT SUGGEST S. IS THE IS THE IDEA THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SINGLE SINGLE TAX ON CONSUMPTION AND GOOD A SIMPLIFIED WAY THAT ALL THESE BAD TO THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS BETWEEN STATES
THE DENBY HAD REDUCED CONSIDERABLY BUT THIS IS THE NUMBER OF THE CHALLENGE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT FACES WHICH IS THAT IT CAN'T SEEM TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION AND PARLIAMENT I'M HOPEFUL AND CONFIDENT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF THE SESSION OF PARLIAMENT WHAT IS THE GROWTH POTENTIAL DO YOU THINK HOW FAR CAN INDIA GO
IN JUST POTENTIAL IS ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN PER CENT WROUGHT ON THE SUSTAINED BASIS BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF GROWTH RATE IF YOU CAN'T MAKE POLICY CHANGES TO REFORM THE ECONOMY IF YOU IF IF POLITICS IN INDIA IS BROKEN YOU CAN'T FIX THE ECONOMY THAT IF WE CAN ACHIEVE SOME MAJOR SUCCESSES I THINK SUCCESS WOULD BE GET SUCCESS GOVERNMENT SO REACTIVE P.P. COME C.A.B. ONE BETTER SCHOOLS FOR OUR KIDS A BETTER HEALTH FACILITIES
THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED TO RESPOND IN A DEMOCRACY THAT'S A CHANGE HAPPENS PEOPLE PUT PRESSURE ON GOVERNMENTS TO CHANGE SO IF THERE'S AN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSMAN LISTENING TO THIS HE'S CONSIDERING INVESTING IN INDIA EGG YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS INVEST IN INDIA THERE IS A BRIGHT FUTURE HERE YEAH I WOULD SAY THE SQUAB FOR MAKING MONEY IN INDIA'S HUGE BRACE YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT FOR THE CHALLENGES AS WELL BUT BUT THE WATER'LL BE IMMENSE
IT WAS JUSTIN AT REPORTED THEIR TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST WE COOK AND I'M AFRAID JOHN YES A COLD AND FROSTY FOR ENGLAND AND WALES THIS MORNING JOHN TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS MINUS FIVE BUT A GLORIOUS SPARKLING START FOR MOST THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE WILL BE ACROSS EAST ANGLIA SOUTH EAST ENGLAND PARTS OF THE EAST MIDLANDS AS WELL ENJOYING A FINE DAY IT'LL TEND TO CLOUD OVER ACROSS THE MORE NORTHERN AND WESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES THROUGH THE DAY INTO THE WEST MIDLANDS AS WELL WITH SOME DAMPNESS TURNING UP TOWARDS WESTERN COASTS EVENTUALLY FEELING CHILLING

JAMES COOK REPORTING IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN
THE GOVERNMENT BEGINS THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCESS TODAY THAT SETS THE DATE FOR THE E.U. REFERENDUM THEY WANT THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE THE S.N.P. AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT THAT THEY SAY THAT'S TOO CLOSE TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS ON FIFTH MAY BUT THEN THERE ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT HAVING THE REFERENDUM AT ALL FIONA HISLOP IS M.S.P. FOR LINLITHGOW SHE THOUGHT A CABINET SECRETARY FOR CULTURE EUROPE AN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS IN THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT AND SHE'S HERE WITH US IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU IT WILL
ON THIS QUESTION OF TIMING THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT IS THERE WELL THE DATE'S SET TO PUSH THAT THING NOW IS TO TO MEET THE POSITIVE CASE AND THAT'S A FRESHNESS WE WERE DOING AND IT WAS SOCIAL OR MAKING A SPEECH HERE IN LONDON TODAY AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ARGUMENTS FOR A YEAR I SET OUT IN A WAY THAT OUR CONSTRUCT OF OUR PRAYER POSITIVE AND IRENE PHIL I THINK WILL BE WE WELCOME NOT JUST IN SCOTLAND BUT ACROSS THE U.K. AND A SETTING OUT A DIFFERENT STALL THEM HAVE PERHAPS WE'VE HEARD
SO FAR FROM THE REMAIN CAMPING YES IT'S INTERESTING THAT SHE'S CHOOSING TO HAVE MAKE THIS SPEECH IN LONDON WITH WHICH IS WHAT PRESUMABLY COS SHE NEEDS DAVID MADE THAT DAVE DO YOU THINK SIR DAVID COME AND NEEDS A BIT OF HELP I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO GET BROADCAST COVERAGE ON A U.K. BASES I'M NOT SURE THAT I WOULD HAVE INVITED ON THIS PROGRAMME FOR EXAMPLE HAS SHE NOT BE MAKING THAT SPEECH SO I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE EYE TURNED TO VIEW HIS HEAD AND OUR VIEW IS WHAT IT IS GO ON OUR VIEW IS THAT WE NEED A EUROPE
IT'S WHAT ABOUT SOLIDARITY IS ABOUT SOCIAL PROTECTION AND IT'S ABOUT MUTUAL SUPPORT I REMEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN YEAR WAS SET OUT OF THE NEED FOR COUNTRIES TO COOPERATE RATHER THAN COME OUT OF CONFLICT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS AND A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS TODAY WILL BE SET OUT WILL COVER THE AREA SOCIAL PROTECTION ISSUES AROUND PAEDS
I HOPE YOU'RE PAID HOLIDAY LEAVE MATERNITY RIGHTS PATERNITY LEAVE ALL THESE THINGS ARE REALLY HARD FOR WORKERS' RIGHTS THAT WE THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE LIVES OF PEOPLE ACROSS SCOTLAND IN EVERYDAY LIFE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND THEREFORE IT'S SET IN THAT
IT IS A WAY OF IDENTIFY SOME OF THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT COME OUT OF EUROPE AND QUITE FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE IS IT A U.K. OUT OF EUROPE LEFT UNDER CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE THAT AGENDA IN THE WAY WE WOULD WANT TO SEE THAT GENDER AND THOSE OF YOUR FELLOW NATIONALISTS WHO SAY THAT THEY ARE VOTING LEAVE DESPITE ACTUALLY
WANTING THE U.K. TO BE PART OF EUROPE BUT IT'S THERE THEY SEE IT AS THE FASTEST WAY TO HIS SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM ON THE CONTRARY I THINK THE ISSUE WILL BE IF THIS GOT VOTES TO REMAIN WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THE REST OF THE U.K. DECIDES TO LEAVE AND WE ARE SOMEHOW FORCED OUT AGAINST OUR WISHES THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WOULD LEAD TO A THE SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING OUR WHAT HAPPENS LEN
WELL WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN BUT WE HAD WHAT WE DO SO IS THERE'LL BE INCREASING DEMANDS FOR INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM BECAUSE DURING OUR REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE WHAT WE WERE TOLD BY THE NORTH SIDE IS THAT WE WOULD BE LEAVING HERE IS A VERY VERY INCORRECTLY BUT ACTUALLY WE WERE SET WE WERE TOLD THAT WE WAITED TO VOTE NO THAT WOULD BE LEAVING THE Y. YOU WERE WHAT'S HAPPENING BARELY BARELY EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER WE'VE GOT THE U.K. GOVERNMENT MARCHING AS TO THE EXIT DOOR OF THE E.U. AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE
SO THOSE WHOSE THOSE WHO SAY THAT FELLOW WE SHOULD VOTE TACTICALLY YOU'D SAY THAT'S WRONG YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET A SECOND REFERENDUM IF YOU VOTE TO STAY IN WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHAT DAVID CAMERON OF COURSE WANTS AND THERE'S AN OVER WELL
THEY'RE IN A MINORITY I I'M SETTING OUT THE POSITION OF THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT IS ALSO THE POSITION IS SHARED BY THE S.N.P. AND INDEED IF YOU LOOK AT THE REMAIN INSIDE THE LEADERS OF ALL THE PARTIES AND SCOTT THEY'RE SAYING THAT WE NEED TO WE ARE HAVING A DIFFERENT DEBATE IN SCOTLAND AND IS IN THE REST OF THE U.K. I WAS I THINK IS FAR MORE PRODUCTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE AND I THINK THAT'S THE POINT OF VIEW THAT SHOULD BE SHARED ACROSS ALL NICKY TALK US THROUGH WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IF THERE IS A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U.
AND WHAT WHAT DOES THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT I DO EXCEPT THE PREMISE WE WE WANT TO SEE THE U.K. REMAIN IN THE E.U. WE WANT TO SEE SCOTT COMMUNE THAT'S WHAT WE WILL BE I KNOW I HAVE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I'M ASKING THE QUESTION IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THOUGH THAT ACROSS THE U.K. THE VOTE COULD BE TO LEAVE SO WHAT DOES THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT DO THEM WELL AND AN UP HE WILL DEFEND THE SCOTTISH INTEREST OF THE SCOTTISH INTEREST WHAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE
AND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TO SELL OUR GOODS AND SERVICES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE SOCIAL PROTECTIONS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DELIVERING THAT NO ICE MEET AT THE CORNER SECOND REFERENDUM ON IT WE WILL BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE INESCAPABLE DEMANDS IT SHOULD SCOTLAND THOUGHTS REMAIN AND THE REST YUKI TO THESE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE SCOTT WOULD WANT TO SEE A CONCERT AND THEN WHAT DO YOU JOIN THE BACK OF THE QUEUE BEHIND TURKEY TO JOIN THE THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE THAT THEY WERE WRONG IN THE FIRST PLACE IS OF COURSE NOT BECAUSE WE ARE CITIZENS REMEMBER
THE CITIZENS' RIGHTS OF THE E.U. I WANT THE STRONGEST ELEMENTS OF THAT ARRANGEMENTS AND WE HAVE BEEN CITIZENS OF THE E.U. FOR FORTY YEARS WE THINK THAT SHOULD CONTAIN COULD CONTINUE AND THERE ARE POSITIVE REASONS FOR DOING THAT SO WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION BECAUSE WE ALREADY ARE CITIZENS WE ARGUE LIKE KISS BEFORE WE KNEW THAT THAT WAS CORRECT THE LAST TIME AND I'M SURE IT WAS WEAK CORRECT GOING FORWARD FIONA HISLOP THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN A THIRD OF ALL THE JOBS IN BRITAIN SHOPS WILL DISAPPEAR WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS THAT'S WHAT THE BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM IS PREDICTING OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR IS COME ON COME ON IS THAT BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GONNA BE BUYING EVERYTHING ON THE INTERNET
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT JOHN CERTAINLY A PRETTY CHILLING REPORT THIS MORNING TO SEE HOW BIG THE RETAIL INDUSTRY IS IN THE U.K. EMPLOYS ONE IN SIX PEOPLE IN THE U.K. IT'S A TENTH ACTUALLY THE SHOPS YES IN THE SHOPS AND ONLINE AND IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND ALL THE LICK LINKED UP JOBS IT'S REALLY A SCEPTRE WHICH IS GOING THROUGH HUGE STRUCTURAL AND POLITICAL
CHANGE WHICH THEY SAY WILL LEAD TO THIS RAPID LOSS OF JOBS AND ALSO A BIG NUMBER OF STALLS CLOSING LET'S LOOK AT THE STRUCTURAL THINGS ONLINE SHOPPING AS YOU SAY JOHN IS CHANGING THE WAY WE SHOP AND ACTUALLY FEWER PEOPLE ARE NEEDED FOR EVERY POUND THAT WE SPEND IN SHOPS IF WE DO THAT SPENDING ON LINE THERE'S AUTOMATION MACHINES TAKING OVER FROM PEOPLE AND OF COURSE THE BIG STRUCTURAL CHANGES THIS MOVE TO THE DISCOUNTERS
IN FOOD RETAIL PARTICULARLY THERE'S BEEN THREE YEARS OF FOOD DEFLATION FALLING PRICES VERY GOOD FOR CONSUMERS NOT SO GOOD FOR THE PROFITABILITY OF SUPERMARKETS ANEMONES TO POLITICAL THINGS WHICH THE REPORT RAISES FIRSTLY DE APPRENTICESHIP LEVY WHICH IS COMING IN FOR A PARTICULARLY LARGE EMPLOYERS WILL BE A COST
FOR THEM AND SECONDLY THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WHICH IS GOING TO BE INTRODUCED IN APRIL FOR ALL OVER TWENTY FIVE SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY AN HOUR RISING TO NINE POUNDS BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THAT MEANS BIG INCREASING COSTS FOR THE RETAIL INDUSTRY I ASKED CHARLIE MAYFIELD HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM WHO BROUGHT OUT THIS REPORT AND IS ALSO THE HEAD OF JOHN LEWIS HOW THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WOULD COULD ACCELERATE THE NUMBER OF JOB LOSSES
AMBITION AND YOU'RE THICK NATIONAL LIVING WAGE SHOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO SIXTY PER CENT OF THE MEDIAN EARNINGS IN THE U.K. NATIONALLY BY TWENTY TWENTY AND AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING PARTICULARLY WRONG WITH THAT AS AN ASPIRATION AND I CAN ABSOLUTELY SEE WHY YOU MIGHT GET TO THAT
THE DIFFICULTY COMES IS THAT MEDIAN EARNINGS IN LONDON ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT TO MEDIAN EARNINGS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THEREFORE THE CHANCES OF THAT HAVING A BIGGER IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT IN AREAS WHICH ARE ECONOMICALLY WE KAFKA'S COS THAT'S DON'T GENERALLY WILL BE THE ONES LIKE THAT IT'S GREATER THAT'S MORE CONCERN EXCEPT A BIT OF A BLUNT INSTRUMENT
SO THERE'D BE POINT THEY'RE MAKING IS THAT THIS AFFECT ON JOBLESS AS WILL BE MORE WILL WILL HATE POORER AREAS OF THE U.K. MORE STRONG AND THEY SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF SHOPS CLOSING WILL ALSO AFFECT THOSE AREAS THAT ARE LESS AFFLUENT RETAILERS HAD A BIG PROBLEM WITH LOW PAY FOR A LONG TIME HAS REALLY STRUCK READING THIS REPORT THAT IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON LOW PAY IN RETAIL AND LOW PAY MEANS LESS THAN ONE POINT TWO TIMES THE MINIMUM WAGE HAS HAS DOUBLED TO SIXTY PER CENT
AND IN THE WHOLE OF THE U.K. EMPLOYMENT THE NUMBERS ONLY TWENTY PER CENT RETAIL HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR LIVING OFF LOW PAY IN THE PASSING AGAIN I ASKED SIR CHARLIE ABOUT THIS SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN LOW LOW PAY IN THE RETAIL SECTOR HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM
THE NATURE OF THE JOBS THAT ARE DONE IN RETAIL ARE HERE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HOPE ALWAYS MEANT THAT THE SECTOR'S HAD A GREATER PROPORTION OF PEOPLE ON LOW PAY THERE IS SOME OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE THAT HAS RISEN AS A PROPORTION AND IT SUBSTANTIALLY BECAUSE THE COSTS ON RETAIL HAVE RISEN FASTER THAN THE LEVEL OF DEMAND IN THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE AND ALSO BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS ALSO CHANGING THE NATURE OF THOSE JOBS AND ALL THOSE EFFECTS ARE PLAYING THEIR PART
CHARLIE MAY FEEL THERE THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN LAST WEEK THE NATIONAL GRID WARNED OF AN ENERGY SHORT FOR JULY AND IT WAS HERE WITH MORE GOOD MORNING SARAH YEAH DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY IN BRITAIN WILL BE HIGHER THAN SUPPLYING FOR ELEVEN WEEKS NEXT WINTER ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL GRID FORECAST FROM THURSDAY
GAS IS ALSO LIKELY TO REPLACE COOL IN THE U.K. BUT NEW GAS PROJECTS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN THE LAW DAVID HELL THERE WAS ENERGY SECRETARY UNDER MARGARET THATCHER ADVISOR TO A NUMBER OF ENERGY COFFEE'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING EASE OUR ENERGY MIX RIGHT AT THE MOMENT WOULD YOU SAY NO IT DEFINITELY ISN'T AND JUST WHAT YOU SAID CONFIRMS IT'S WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE ENERGY IN THE WORLD
WE HAVE THE REAL THREATS OF A POWER SUPPLY CUTS AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE DOING AS MUCH FOR THE CAR ORGANISATION WHICH THE WORLD CLEARLY WANTS AS WE SHOULD BE SO WE'RE ON THE WRONG TRACK HERE IN BRITAIN I THINK WE'RE ON THE WRONG TRACK GENERALLY IN EUROPE AND THERE WAS A BIG RE SET IN ENERGY POLICY REQUIRED TO GET THINGS ON BACK ON PARKER TALKING OF RESET THE GERMANY OF THE GERMANS HAVE GOT COLIN AND EGGY VENDOR WHICH BASICALLY TRANSFORMING THEIR ENERGY REQUIREMENT AWAY FROM FOSSIL FEELS ENTIRELY
TOWARDS RENEWABLES HOW'S THAT GOING FOR THEM AND SHOULD WE MODEL OURSELVES ON THAT ER DEFINITELY NOT IT'S GOING REALLY BADLY IT'S PRODUCING ALL ITS A PUT PERFECT EXAMPLE OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND REVERSE RESULTS AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE INTRODUCER OF COURSE AFTER THE FOOTY SEEM A DISASTER AGAIN CLEAR THEY'VE CLOSED DOWN NUCLEAR KEL THEY'RE GOING TO PHASE OUT THE FAMILY ABOUT NINETEEN BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WHAT HAVE THEY GOT THE BURNING MORE COAL THAN EVER THEY'RE BURNING LIGNITE BROWN COAL WHICH IS THE DIRTIEST OF ALL THEY'RE IMPORTING MORE RUSSIAN GAS IMPORTING FRENCH NUCLEAR POWER GERMAN INDUSTRIES AND UPROAR BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDERMINING THEIR CAN THE COSTS WITH A NOT QUITE AS BAD AS US ACTUALLY BECAUSE I'LL STILL COST FOR INSTANCE
ENERGY COS YOU CAN HIRE THEM THERE BUT IT'S A MESS AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT AND IT'S PART OF THE BIGGER EUROPEAN METZ AND THEIR DECISION TO FAIRS IN GERMAN IT WAS REALLY A DECISION AGAINST LOW CARBON IT'S COS OBVIOUSLY AND LONGER TERM
COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR AS OPPOSED TO THE EXPENSIVE BRILL EXPENSIVE STUFF DOES REQUIRE IS PART OF THE LOW CARBON PART I HAVE TO ASK ABOUT HINKLEY POINT THE PROPOSED NEW NUCLEAR POWER STATION IN SOMERSET WILL IT GO AHEAD AND IF SO SHOULD IT GO
IT'S A BIG ENOUGH AND IT'S GETTING MORE IF IT WAS WHO WROTE THIS MORNING THEY'RE STILL WONDER ABOUT HOW TO RAISE THE FINANCE FOR IT AND THE REASON IS OF COURSE BECAUSE IT IS A GIGANTIC IT'S OF DINOSAUR OF A BOTTLE THERE ARE NO OTHER MODEL OF THIS KIND OF NETWORKING ON THE WORLD THE ONE THEY BUILT IN FINLAND
BEHIND AND WHEN I SAID ABOUT YOUR ELECTRICITY DEFILES E.D.F. THIS IS PROBABLY THE WRONG DESIGN IT'S ONE OF THE SAW LAST BATTLESHIP AT SOME OLD FASHIONED SYSTEM WE CAN PUT FORWARD TOOK AT NUCLEAR DEVELOPMENT IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES IN THIS COUNTRY IT WILL BE A SMALLER CHEAPER SAFER
LESS WASTE AND SOLVING ALL SORTS OF TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS BUT THIS IS A GREAT LUMPING SO PYRAMID FROM THE PAST AND I'VE BEEN VERY DOUBTFUL ALL LONG LITTLE TAKE OR FIGHT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER NOW BUT IT'S LOOKING VERY FEW INDEED AT OR DAVID HOW THEY'RE FROM ENERGY SECRETARY HAS GOT A BOOK OUT ON THE SUBJECT AS WE SPEAK YES END OF ENERGY
EMPIRES IN COLLISIONS COMING OUT NEXT WEEK AND IT'S THE REAL BATTLE WHICH WE MUST RESOLVE BETWEEN LITTLE OF THE WORLD OF THE GROUP OF GREEN ENERGY WITH THE WORLD WANTS AND THE GIGANTIC HYDROCARBON COAL OIL AND GAS SYSTEM THAT'S RULED THIS PLANET FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THEY'VE GOT TO MAKE PEACE WITH EACH OTHER OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF HER BEFORE A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HELL THANK YOU
IT IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THOUGH HERE'S A WARNING IF YOU'RE UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN AND LIVING IN CERTAIN TOWNS YOU MUST NOT STAND IN A GROUP YOU CAN WALK BUT NOT STAND IF YOU'RE A GOLFER BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHERE YOU CARRY YOUR GOLF BAG THAT'S NOT ALLOWED EITHER
THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOUR SHOCKING BEHAVIOUR OBVIOUSLY IS BANNED BY CERTAIN COUNCILS USING P.S. PIOS IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM THEY ARE PUBLIC
SPACE PROTECTION ORDERS WHICH CAME INTO FORCE MONTHS AGO THEIR MANIFESTO CLUB WHICH IS A CIVIL LIBERTIES CAMPAIGNING ORGANISATIONS GETTING VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE WAY THEY'RE BEING THEY SAY ABUSED JOSIE APPLETON IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE MANIFESTO CLUB AND SHE'S ON THE LINE SIMON BLACKBURN CHAIRS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION SAFER STRONGER COMMUNITY BOARD IS ALSO COUNCIL LEADER FOR BLACKPOOL JOSIE APPLE DONE A FEW MORE EXAMPLES I'VE GIVEN A COUPLE THERE WHICH SOUND TRULY BIZARRE
IN KETTERING IT'S ILLEGAL TO GO OUT AFTER ELEVEN AT NIGHT IF YOU'RE UNDER EIGHTEEN AT ALL YES OH WELL UNLESS YOU'RE ACCOMPANIED BY SOMEONE OVER IF YOU WANT TO GO AND SEE HER GRANNY FIRST ELEVEN YOU CAN'T NO YOU CAN'T WRITE IN SWINDON PAVEMENT ART IS NOW PROHIBITED AND THAT'S A CITY WITH A VERY RENOWNED PAVEMENT ARTIST WHO NOW CANNOT PRACTISE IN HILLINGDON YOU CANNOT GATHER INTO GROUPS OF TWO OR MORE UNLESS YOU'RE WAITING A DONATED BUST UP
YOU KNOW THE REALLY THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THESE NEW CRIMES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO THE HILLINGDON ONE A GROUP OF WHAT IS THIS JUST TEENAGERS OR IS IT GROWN UPS AS WELL IT'S TARGETED AT YOU NOTICED BUT THE LAW IS FOR GROWN UPS TO WRITE A GROUP OF FRIENDS HAPPEN TO BUMP INTO EACH OTHER ON THE STREET AND THEY STOP AND HAVE A CHAT AND THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAW YEAH EXACTLY WELL SIMON BLACKBURN CAN YOU JUSTIFY THIS
ABSOLUTELY JOHN THESE ORDERS ARE USED TO ADDRESS ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IN PUBLIC SPACES WHICH GO IN THE SEA A GRANULAR BUS ELEVEN IS ANTI SOCIAL I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE WAY IN WHICH THE THE LOW IS ACTUALLY APPLIED CLEARLY IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES NO ACTION WILL BE TAKEN AGAINST PEOPLE ACTING IN THIS WAY BECAUSE HE'D BE BEHAVING IN AN ENTIRELY INNOCENT WAY WHAT THESE POWERS DO IS THAT THEY DO GIVE COUNCILS AND THE POLICE THE ABILITY
TO ENFORCE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ARE CAUSING ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR BUT THAT'S A VERY DODGY BASIS TO HAVE A NEW LAW ISN'T IT GIVE THAT GIVE THE AUTHORITIES ALL THE POWER THAT THEY WANT AND LET THEM DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT THAT'S NOT DEMOCRATIC AGGRESSIVE BEGGING CHARITY COLETTE A PUBLIC DRINKING IN THE SALE OF LEGAL HIGHS ARE FAR FROM BIZARRE OR TRIVIAL ISSUE I DIDN'T SAY THEY WERE YOU JUST RAISE THAT WAS I WAS TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE STANDING IN A GROUP OR GOING OUT IT UP PAST ELEVEN AT NIGHT OR SOMETHING
IF THERE ARE A LARGE GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING EVERY MORNING KEEP IN YOUR WORK YOU WOULD EXPECT THE LOCAL COUNCIL AND THE POLICE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND THERE ARE ALREADY OFFENCES THAT THEY CAN INTRODUCE THAT THEY CAN REFER TO TO STOP THAT SORT OF THING HAPPENING CAN'T THEY THREATENING BEHAVIOUR OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE BUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO ORTH SORRY THREE I THINK IT HAS TO BE THREE DOESN'T IT JOSIE APPLETON
IT DEPENDS ON THE AREA TO IN HILLINGDON AND THREE IMPASSIVE SO TO YOUNG PEOPLE STANDING TOGETHER HAVING A CHAT ON THE STREET AND THEY ARE
IN THEORY AT ANY RATE WEATHER OR WHETHER IT'S PROSECUTED OR NOT THEIR PRACTICE THEY ARE ACTUALLY BREAKING THE LAW THAT'S BONKERS SURELY THERE'S A CERTAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICE IS HUGE IT'S LIKE BUT SHE DOESN'T THAT'S MY POINT WELL THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN LOCAL COUNCILS THE POWER IT'S FOR LOCAL COUNCILS TO CONSULT WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES TO DECIDE OUR HAVE THOSE POWERS A REPLY A BIT YOU DID THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT ISN'T IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO INTRODUCE THOSE THING I'M IN THE GOVERNMENT SAYS
YOU MAY HAVE PUBLIC SPACE PROTECTION ORDERS YOU MAY INTRODUCE CERTAIN PUBLIC SPACE BUT IT'S THEN AS I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IT'S FOR THE COUNCIL THEN TO DECIDE WHAT WILL BE EMBRACED BY THOSE ORDERS ABSOLUTELY BUT THE COUNCIL DOES THAT IN CONSULTATION WITH RESIDENTS AND WITH CONSULTATION WITH OTHER LOCAL COUNCILLORS AND OTHER PUBLIC BODIES WE COUNCIL BUDGETS HAVE BEEN HALVED IN THE PAST SIX YEARS WE DON'T GO AROUND LOOKING FOR PROBLEMS TO SOLVE
WELL IN THAT CASE JOE'S YUP IF EVERYBODY EVERYBODY'S BEEN CONSULTED ARE VOTED THAT'S FINE SURELY THEY'RE NOT BEING CONSULTED I THINK THAT THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN FIFTY PERCENT OF CASES THE LAWS ARE PASSED BY SINGLE COUNCIL OFFICER I KNOW THE PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS WERE A BIT OF A JOKE FRANKLY YOU KNOW NINE RESPONSES FOR WHICH FROM COUNCIL WORKERS SO MANY OF THESE THESE AREN'T ACTUALLY ACCOUNTABLE DEMOCRATICALLY I THINK IF THEY WERE TO BE A DIFFERENT QUESTION SO I THINK THEY REALLY YOU NEED A PROPER PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROPER DEBATE
AND ALSO FOR THEM TO GO THROUGH FOR COUNCIL IN EVERY CASE YOU CANNOT HAVE A SINGLE COUNCIL OFFICER INVENTING A LAW IN A MATTER OF DAYS THAT'S JUST GOES AGAINST EVERY PRINCIPLE ON THERE BUT THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH ISN'T IT MY POINT THERE BE FAIR ENOUGH IF IT WAS TRUE NICE THROUGH THE MANIFESTO CLUBS OWN RESEARCH WHICH ON THE LOOKS AT SEVENTY NINE COUNCIL HAS QUITE A LOT THAT WELL IT'S A QUARTER OF COUNCIL SURE TOMORROW BUT IT ACTUALLY IN A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF CASES THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE BY FULL COUNCIL YOU BUT IN SOME CASES YOU'RE ACKNOWLEDGING THEY'RE NOT
I AM HOWEVER ALL OF THOSE DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SCRUTINY BY DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED COUNCILLORS JUST GOING TO SAY IT SEVENTY NINE COUNCILS OUT OF ALL COUNCILS OF BUTCHERY ORDER SO WE SURVEYED ALL COUNCILS SEVENTY NINE BROUGHT IT THROUGH RIGHT ONLY SIXTEEN PERCENT WENT THROUGH FOR COUNCIL SIXTEEN PERCENT OF THOSE WHO PASSED OR THERE'S ANY SIXTY PERCENT WENT BEFORE COUNCIL FIFTY PER CENT WENT THROUGH ONE COUNCIL LEADER DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO SCRUTINY
I THINK IT'S VERY MINIMAL SCRUTINY REALLY YOU'RE TALKING A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE SUBJECT SOMETIMES IN CONSULTATION WITH A BUSINESS GROUP OR WHATEVER BUT REALLY A LOT OF AREAS HACKNEY COUNCIL PASSED A LAW BANNING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING ROUGH SLEEPING LOITERING AND NO ONE KNEW ABOUT IT LOCAL PAPER CALLED US UP AND SAY WE NEVER HEARD ABOUT THIS WHERE'S THIS COME FROM RIGHT QUICK WORD ON THAT RESPECT FOR WELL IT'S NOT UNCOMMON I'M AFRAID FOR THE LOCAL MEDIA NOT FELLOW COUNCIL ACTIVITIES AS CLOSELY AS THEY MIGHT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH SO I'M A BLACKBURN JOSIE APPLETON THANK YOU

TWENTY FIVE TO EIGHT PEOPLE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAY CHARITIES AROUND THE TRUSTEES WILL BE OFFICIALLY REMINDED TODAY OF THEIR LEGAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES SEEMS AN ODD THING TO DO IF THEY DON'T YOU KNOW WHO YOU MIGHT WONDER WHAT THEY'RE DOING AS TRUSTEES IN THE FIRST PLACE THE MORNING HAS COME FROM THE BODY THAT OVERSEES THEM THE CHARITIES COMMISSION ITS CHAIRMAN IS WILLIAM SHAWCROSS GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT INTO THE WARNING ITSELF WHAT SORTS OF THINGS ARE GOING ON IN CHARITIES THAT ARE GIVING YOU CONCERN WELL THIS IS THE SPECIFIC ALERT OR WARNING ABOUT COMMERCIAL PARTNERSHIPS AND AGREEMENTS THAT CHARITIES MAKE WITH COMPANIES AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE PROPER AND O.K. FOR CHARITIES TO DO THAT I THINK WE KNOW WE KNOW OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED CHARITIES THAT HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH BUSINESSES
AND THAT HELPS THEM FUN ROSE WHO HELPS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THEIR CAUSE OF THE CHARITY'S CAUSE AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO TROUBLE ABOUT IT WHATSOEVER SO LONG AS THE CHARITIES AND THE TRUSTEES REMEMBER THAT WHENEVER THEY ENTER ENTER INTO A COMMERCIAL PARTNERSHIP THEY MUST ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CHARITIES NAME AND REPUTATION ARE VERY VALUABLE PUBLIC ASSETS AND MUSTN'T BE DAMAGED BY AN INAPPROPRIATE
RELATIONSHIP AND I DON'T HAVE SUCH BUT THE REASON IT'S SO MUCH IN THE NEWS AT THE MOMENT IS BECAUSE THE SUN EXPOSED AGE U.K. AS EARNING WHAT WAS IT SIX MILLION A YEAR FROM RECOMMENDING ENERGY DEALS THAT WEREN'T ACTUALLY THE CHEAPEST AVAILABLE THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY PUT THIS IN THE HEADLINES ISN'T IT WELL YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT THE AGE U.K. CASE COS IT IS UNDER INTESTINE NO INDEED BUT I MEAN THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT IF YOU WON'T PROBE AND THEN THAT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT
IF IT IS WE WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY CHARITY THAT HAVEN'T DONE DUE DILIGENCE ON ITS RELATIONSHIP WE'VE GOT TRUSTEES TRUSTEES OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL IN ALL TRACTORS THEY MUST BE SATISFIED THAT ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY COMMERCIAL COMPANY OR ANYTHING ELSE THEY DO OF COURSE IS IN THE CHARITIES BUT NOT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE ALL THE GERMAN OR WHATEVER
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE TRUSTEES MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE TRUSTEES MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND THE EXECUTIVE GENERALLY ARE ALWAYS ACT IN THE TERM IN THE CHARITIES BEST INTEREST IN THE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE BUCK STOPS WITH THE TRUSTEES
BUT THE POINT I MADE EARLIER WAS THAT IF THEY DON'T ALREADY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE AND I QUOTE RELEVANT LEGAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE THEY SHOULDN'T BE TRUSTING YOU SHALL HAVE IT WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CHARITIES AND I THINK MOST TRUSTEES DOON KNOW THERE ARE ONE MILLION TRUSTEES IN THE COUNTRY TODAY IT'S A FANTASTIC CROSS SECTION OF PEOPLE YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT THE PHILANTHROPY IS PART OF
BRITTEN'S LIFE AND SOUL IF YOU LIKE THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND CHARITIES IN THIS COUNTRY AND THEY HAVE A TOTAL INCOME OF ALMOST SEVENTY BILLION POUNDS A YEAR
A HUGE PART OF SOCIETY AND MOST CHARITIES ARE ACTUALLY VERY SMALL WITH AN INCOME OF LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND THE WHAT I CALL COTTAGE TABLE CHURCH KITCHEN TABLE CHAIR SO THEY RUN LOCAL ORGANISATION AND THOSE TRUSTEES ARE FOR THE MOST PART VERY VERY DILIGENT THEY MAY NOT BE
THEY MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY EVERY POINT TO CHARITY LAW BOTH IN THE TINY SHOUTED THAT THEY SET UPS PEOPLE HAVE SET UP IN MEMORY OF THEIR FATHER ALL HER TRIALS OR IN AID OF CANCER RESEARCH THAT'S THAT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM DO EXTREMELY GOOD JOB ARE YOU WORRIED OR RATHER
HOW WORRIED ARE YOU PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY WERE THE WAY THAT MANY OF THE BIGGER CHARITIES RAISE THEIR MONEY THIS SORT OF CHUGGING BUSINESS THAT SHOCKING CASE OF THE OLD LADY OF OLIVE COOK SHE WAS NINETY TWO WASN'T SHE AND SHE KILLED HERSELF BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN HOUNDED APPARENTLY HOUNDED FOR MONEY BY HUNDREDS LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CHARITIES
WELL I SHOULD SAY THAT HER FAMILY SAY THAT THAT WAS NOT THE REASON THAT SHE KILLED HERSELF BUT DOING IS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION AND UNFORGIVABLE AND CHARITIES SHOULD NEVER INDULGE IN IT CAN'T YOU IT RIGHT
WE CAN TELL TRIED TO THEY MUST NOT DO IT AND THEY WILL DO IT I'M MAKING A SPEECH IN SOUTHAMPTON TODAY SAYING HOUNDING OF CHARITIES OF PEOPLE BY CHARITIES IS ABSOLUTELY INTOLERABLE I MET SOMEBODY YESTERDAY WHO SAID THAT HE HAD TEXTED TWENTY TWO AN APPEAL WHICH HE'D SEEN ON TELEVISION AND SUBSEQUENTLY HAD HUNDREDS OF CALLS TO HIS MOBILE PHONE SAYING WOULD YOU MAKE THAT TWENTY INTO STANDING ORDERS AND SO ON AND PEOPLE MUST NOT
BE TREATED LIKE THAT WATCH OUT SHE'S NEVER ABUSE I UM I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THE INTELLIGENT ROOM BUDGET BUT YOU DO KNOW PLAYED CHARITY TO DO THAT SORT OF THING THAT AFTER THE OLIVE COOK CASE WHICH YOU'VE MENTIONED THE EXPOSURE BY THE DAILY MAIL OF BAD CHARITABLE PACKED SINCE LAST SUMMER
THE GOVERNMENT IN THE CHARITY SECTOR ITSELF BUT HE HAS SET UP A NEW CHARITY FUNDRAISING REGULATOR WE'LL CHARGE COMMISSION DO NOT AT THE MOMENT REGULATE PARLIAMENT HAS NEVER FUNDRAISING PARLIAMENT HAS NEVER ASKED US TO DO THAT SHOULD DO IT NO I THINK THE CHURCHES OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT THEMSELVES AND THE NEW REGULATOR HAS BEEN SET UP AND MICHAEL GRADE FORMALLY OF YOUR PARISH AND I THINK THIS WILL HAVE MEANT MUCH MORE TO YOU
AND IT WILL GIVE THE CHARITIES AND THE ABILITY TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN RUN FUNDRAISING IN THEIR OWN BEST INTERESTS AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PUB WHAT WHAT IF THEY DON'T MANAGE TO SIX IF THEY DON'T SUCCEED THEN I SUSPECT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE US THE CHARITY COMMISSION THE TASK BUT I WOULD MUCH RATHER THAN TO GET MUCH BETTER FOR TROUT JUST TO BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT WHAT A WONDERFUL
SORRY WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU'RE NOT IT DID THE CHARITY COMMISSION THAT IS WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU IF YOU'RE NOT A REGULATOR WHAT POWERS DO YOU ALL RIGHT REGULATOR WE ARE WE HAVE A LOT OF POWER HAS A LOT OF POWERS TO STOP SHOUT HE'S BEHAVING BADLY AND THERE WAS A NEW A NEW AN EXCELLENT NEW BILL WENT THROUGH PARLIAMENT RECENTLY THE CHAIR THE PROTECTION THE CHURCHES
WHICH ALLOWS US FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO BAN PEOPLE WITH CONVICTIONS FOR CERTAIN CRIMINAL OFFENCES SUCH AS TERRORISM OR MONEY LAUNDERING FROM BECOMING TRUSTEES THE PLAYERS A LOT OF OTHER LOOPHOLES WHICH MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO GO AGAINST CHARITIES WHICH REALLY WERE BEHAVING BADLY AND THESE NEW POWERS WHICH PARLIAMENT HAS NOW GIVE US TO GOODNESS WILL MAKE US EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WE HAVE BEEN SO AFFECTIVE CUT CAN I TURN IT UP LIKE THIS OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE
AS YOU SAY A VAST NUMBER OF CHARITIES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT DO AN EXTREMELY GOOD JOB A VERY NECESSARY JOB FRANK FIELD THE LABOUR M.P. SPOKE AT THE A.G.M. LAST YEAR AND HE SAID WHAT I ALWAYS HAVE BELIEVED THAT CHARITIES ARE CRUCIAL TO A FREE SOCIETY RIGHT BUT SOFTEN THE STATE BUT SOME OF THEM ARE JUST TOO BIG TO PURPLE THEY PAY THE JEEP THAT BOSSES TOO MUCH MONEY AND THE BEAR TOO AGGRESSIVE IT DOES THAT
NO THAT'S NOT FAIR THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT BOSS'S PET HAVE NO WE HAVEN'T I DON'T LIKE TO DROP THAT IN AT THE LAST MINUTE BUT BUT THE GENERAL MAJORITY THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHARITIES DO A VERY GOOD JOB WE AS THE REGULATOR ARE THERE TO STOP THOSE FEW CHARITIES THAT ARE BAD ON THAT CAN DAMAGE THE REPUTATION OF THE WHOLE CHARITABLE WORK RIGHT AND I'M ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED THAT THE CHARITY COMMISSION FOR ME WHICH WILL BE A TOUGH ROBUST ORGANISATION WE HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE SO IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WILLIAM SHAWCROSS MANY THANKS
IT'S NOW NINETY MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THAT'S A NEW ONE TODAY IT'S CALLED THE NEW DAY IT'S BEEN LAUNCHED BY THE PUBLISHERS OF THE MIRROR AND IT COMES WITH A MISSION STATEMENT A CLEARING THAT IT WILL BE A NEW TYPE OF NEWSPAPER WITH A COMMITMENT TO MAKING EVERYTHING IT CONTAINS EITHER USEFUL OR BEAUTIFUL IDEALLY BOTH

THE CASUAL ATROCITIES CARRIED OUT BY MEMBERS OF SAW DIRE ASH AND HEAR ABOUT THE REALITIES OF EVERYDAY LIFE UNDER A BRUTAL REGIME FOR OBVIOUS REASONS WE CHANGE SOME DETAILS OF HIS STORY AND GOT AN ACTOR TO VOICES WORDS IT'S FRIDAY THIS IS THE DAY WE USED TO GATHER IN THE STREET AFTER PLAYERS AND HAVE LONG CHATS
BUT NOT ANY MORE ANYONE GATHERING IN PUBLIC WITHOUT PERMISSION NOW RISKS BEING ACCUSED OF PLOTTING AGAINST THAT
I'M PASSING A CROWD IN A PUBLIC SQUARE I DON'T WANT TO JOIN THEM BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO WATCH SHOULD BE HEADING BUT THANK GOD IT'S ONLY A LASHING THIS TIME THE FRIEND THAT IS ONE OF THEIR IS HIS OFFENCE I'M TOLD WAS GETTING OUT A HOMOSEXUAL
TOMORROW I GO BACK TO WORK AND YOU WEAK WITH NEW HOPES OF BEING LIBERATED BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHEN ISLAMIC STATE FIRST ENTERED MY BELOVED CITY
ON MOTHER'S DAY A COLD WINTER MORNING I HEARD THE SOUNDS OF WAR PLANES I IMMEDIATELY SET OUT FOR MY HOME MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND I HAD PLANNED A SMALL PARTY AS MY TAXI NEARED
CLOUDS OF SMOKE FILLED THE AIR BETTER JAMES WAR PLANES HAD HIT OUR STREET THERE WERE AMBULANCES EVERYWHERE PEOPLE WERE RUNNING AROUND GETTING THE DEAD AND INJURED ONE OF MY NEIGHBOURS TOLD ME THAT MY PARENTS WERE HURT AND HAD BEEN TAKING TO THE GENERAL HOSPITAL
WHEN WE ARRIVED THERE THE SMELL OF BLOOD AND DEATH FILLED THE PLACE THEY ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE BODIES LAID OUT IN FRONT OF US TO SEE IF MY PARENTS WERE AMONGST THEM THERE WAS MY DAD HIS BODY WAS COVERED IN SHARP NO ONE'S YOUR MOTHER IS BEING TREATED IN THERE A VOICE SAID QUIETLY BUT DON'T GO IN YET TWO HOURS PAST FINALLY DOCTOR OR CAME OUT I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS HER ELDEST SON
I'VE MANAGED TO SAVE HER LIFE BUT SHE'S VERY ILL HE SAID
ANY BIT OF OURS WHO RUNS A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SHOP OFFERED TO HELP
FROM NOW ON HE SAID YOU CAN WORK FOR ME I ACCEPT IT UNCONDITIONALLY
A FEW WEEKS LATER I WAS WORKING IN THE SHOP WHEN I HEARD GUNFIRE AND THE BOOM OF HEAVY WEAPONS OUTSIDE EVERYONE WAS RUNNING ON THE STREET MY FRIEND GRIPPED MY ARM AND SAID THEIR HOUSE HAD TAKEN OVER THE CITY
SOON AFTER THAT A MAN HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE SHOUTED AT ME HEY YOU SMOKING IS NOT ALLOWED
ANOTHER CRIED HEY YOU WHY IS YOUR WIFE NOT WEARING A VEIL THIS IS FOR A BIT
I HEARD LOUD SPEAKERS IN THE STREETS SAYING SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE ABOUT TO BE EXECUTED A GROUP OF BLINDFOLDED YOUNG MEN STOOD IN HANDCUFFS IN FRONT OF THEM AMASSED MAN BEGAN READING
FIGHTING WITH THE REGIME FORCES HIS PUNISHMENT BE HEADING
LISA WAS A MEDIA ACTIVIST ACCUSED OF SPEAKING TO FOREIGN PARTIES HIS PUNISHMENT BEHEADING
A MAN WITH A SWORD CARRIED OUT THE PUNISHMENT AS THEY WALK DOWN THE ROAD CURSING OUT LOUD A GROUP OF DASHES RELIGIOUS POLICE RUSHED OVER AND GRABBED ME THEY TOOK ME TO THEIR HEADQUARTERS I TRIED TO REASON WITH THEM BUT IT WAS NO USE YOU WERE CURSING OUT LOUD YOUR PUNISHMENT HIS FORTY LASHES
WE'LL HEAR ANOTHER OF THOSE DIARIES TOMORROW AND ALSO IF YOU GO TO OUR WEBSITE YOU CAN SEE AN ANIMATED VERSION OF TODAY'S DIARY IT'S BEEN PRODUCED BY THE ARTIST AND ANIMATOR SCOTT QUAIL UM B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U.K. FORWARD SLASH TODAY
IT IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A BRIGHTON STUDIO THIS MORNING IS TIM STANLEY AS A HISTORIAN AND WRITES FOR THE TELEGRAPH GOOD MORNING TIM GOOD MORNING WE'RE ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH LENT AND IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME YOU'LL ALREADY HAVE LET YOURSELF DOWN
I INTENDED TO GIVE UP ALCOHOL AND MEAT THE ALCOHOL PLEDGE WAS BROKEN WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS WHEN SOMEONE OFFERED ME A GIN AND TONIC AND I ABSENT MINDEDLY SAID MAKE IT A DOUBLE AS FOR THE MEAT WELL EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE BEST CURE FOR A HANGOVER IS A BACON SANDWICH
WHETHER YOU KEEP LENT OR NOT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE FEELING OF TRYING VERY HARD TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING NOT QUITE MAKING IT AND BEING TEMPTED TO CALL IT QUITS AND GIVE UP BUT I'M TRYING TO RESIST THAT TEMPTATION
FOR ME AS A CATHOLIC LENT ISN'T ABOUT ACHIEVING PERFECTION IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO EMULATE CHRIST PERIOD OF WANDERING IN THE DESERT WHEN WE ARE TOLD THAT THE DEVIL TEMPTED HIM WITH THE PROMISES OF FOOD GLORY AND POWER
JESUS IMPLACABLY RESISTED BECAUSE I BELIEVE HE WAS THE SON OF GOD I ON THE OTHER HAND AM JUST A HUMAN BEING SUCCESSORS IDEAL BUT FAILURE IS NOT UNEXPECTED WHAT MATTERS IS THAT I TRY TO BE THE BEST I CAN
SHORTLY AFTER I CONVERTED TO CATHOLICISM I WENT TO A PRIEST FOR CONFESSION AND SAID THAT I FEARED IT WASN'T WORKING OUT I STILL SIN I MOANED I LET MYSELF AND OTHERS DOWN THE PRIEST SAID TO ME BUT BY THE VERY FACT THAT YOU'VE COME HERE TO CONFESS YOUR SINS YOU'VE SHOWN THAT YOU HAVE CHANGED
AND HE WAS RIGHT BUT I WAS PREPARED TO GO OUT ON A COLD EVENING AND ADMIT EVERYTHING TO A TOTAL STRANGER SHOW THAT I AT LEAST NOW WORRIED ABOUT MY FAULTS AND CARED ABOUT PUTTING THEM RIGHT
I HAD ENTERED INTO A DIALOGUE WITH MY OWN CONSCIENCE
SOMETIMES IN LIFE WE CAN FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON ENDS AND UNDERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF MEANS
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO BE A GOOD PERSON OR A HEALTHIER PERSON OR A HAPPIER PERSON BUT EVEN IF WE FAILED TO ATTAIN A GOAL THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET THEIR CAN IN ITSELF BE REDEMPTIVE
CONSIDER THE MAN WHO CLIMBS A MOUNTAIN GETS HALFWAY AND IS FORCED TO STOP BY FOR TEAK SURE HE DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE TOP AND THAT'S DISAPPOINTING BUT HE SAW THE MAGNIFICENT PEAK CLOSER THAN ANY OF US COULD CLAIM TO AND HE WILL HAVE HAD A CLEARER VIEW OF THE WORLD BELOW HIM THAN THE REST OF US CAN EVER IMAGINE HE HAS ATTAINED WISDOM
AND OF COURSE WHEN HE REGAINS HIS ENERGY HE CAN RESUME HIS CLIMB
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH TIM STANLEY THE HISTORIAN AND DAILY TELEGRAPH WRITER IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
ANOTHER DODGY DOSSIER FROM PROJECT FEAR THAT'S HOW A CABINET MINISTER WHO WANTS TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAS DESCRIBED THE LATEST GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT IT CLAIMS THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE IT WOULD LEAD TO A DECADE OF DAMAGING UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE OF THE PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS THAT WOULD FOLLOW
ON THAT HANCOCK IS MINISTER FOR THE CABINET OFFICE AND BEHIND TODAY'S PUBLICATION AND HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH ME NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHY DO YOU SAY IT WOULD BE A DECADE OF DAMAGING UNCERTAINTY WILL THIS IS A GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT THAT WE
PROMISED PARLIAMENT THAT WE WOULD BE PRODUCED DURING THE PASSAGE OF THE REFERENDUM BILL AND PEOPLE ARE ASKING RIGHTLY FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SHOULD WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THIS DOCUMENT SETS OUT THE PROCESS THE PROCESS INVOLVES FIRSTLY A NEGOTIATION OF THE TERMS OF OUR EXIT
THEN NEEDING TO NEGOTIATE WHAT A FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. WOULD BE AND THEN HAVING TO GO AND NEGOTIATE WHAT ALL OF OUR TRADE DEALS WITH THE STAR FIFTY THREE OTHER O.K. BUT I IT WOULD BE I KNOW I KNOW WE'RE IN A LOT OF NEGOTIATIONS OVER LOTS OF THINGS ALL THE TIME IN TERMS OF WHAT IT MEANS THE DAYS AFTER A VOTE TO LEAVE WHAT CHANGES WHAT CHANGES FOR BUSINESSES FOR PEOPLE TRAVELLING FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE BRITISH PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN EUROPE AND WHEN EUROPEANS WHO LIVE HERE WELL THE TRUTH IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW
AND THOSE WHO ARE PROPOSING TO LEAVE I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON THEM TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE TWO MILLION BRITS WHO LIVE
IN OTHER PLACES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD THEY STILL HAVE ACCESS TO FREE HEALTH CARE FOR INSTANCE THE MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SPAIN I COULD BE JUST IMMEDIATELY NOTHING'S GOING TO CHECK THEM IN THE REALITY IS NOTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE JUST AS WE WON'T CHANGE THINGS FOR EUROPEANS HERE EVERYTHING ONE PRESUMES THAT EVERYTHING WILL CONTINUE ON THE SAME BASIS UNTIL THERE ARE NEW RULES IN PLACE WELL THERE'S A TWO YEAR PERIOD IN WHICH THOSE NEW RULES CAN BE NEGOTIATED
SO THAT'S THE FIRST THIS IS WHY IT TAKES SO LONG WHEN CALEB WILL YOU WILL YOU JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NOTHING REALLY CHANGES UNTIL THE NEW RULES COME IN I MEAN IT MAY TAKE A WHILE TO SORT THOSE OUT BUT NOTHING ACTUALLY CHANGES WHAT YOU ACCESSED A FISHERY OPE TO WATERS EUROPEAN WATERS FOR FOR FOR A FISHING FLEET AND NOTHING CHANGES UNTIL THERE ARE NEW RULES NO THAT'S NOT RIGHT THERE IT WILL TAKE TWO YEARS
IN WHICH WE GO THROUGH THE FIRST PART OF THIS WHICH IS RENEGOTIATING A RELATIONSHIP WITH E.U. COUNTRIES DURING THAT PERIOD THERE ARE BUSINESSES AROUND BRITAIN WHO SAY THAT THERE WILL BE A RISK TO JOBS AND INVESTMENT COS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WILL BE
AND THERE ARE REAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS FOR JOBS AND LIVELIHOODS AND I'M NOT I MUST SAY THIS IS ONLY MY VIEW
IT IS ALSO THE VIEW OF SOME OF THE LEAVES CAMPAIGNERS WHO HAVE SAID THAT THERE WILL BE IN THEIR WORDS PAIN AND PROBLEMS AND RISK
AND COST AN UNCERTAINTY I THINK TACTICALLY WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE WHAT I AM WHAT'S STRANGE IS THAT IF YOU ARE A BRITISH COMPANY A NEW TRADE AND YOU HAVE A TRADING ARRANGEMENT WITH SOMEBODY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT IS GOING TO CHANGE IN THE SHORT TERM WHILE NEW THINGS BEING LIKE THAT ACTUALLY STOPS SOMEBODY SELLING SOMEBODY BUYING THE FIRST THING THAT WILL HAPPEN
IS THAT BUSINESSES WILL NOT KNOW WHAT THEIR FUTURE ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE AND SO WHEN THEY'RE MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING WHERE TO CREATE JOBS THEY WILL NOT KNOW WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIP WILL BE AND I THINK THAT WILL HAVE
AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT AND THE AND I JUST PUT IT ARE YOU SAYING THAT SOMEBODY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL A CAR OR BUY A CAR FROM YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY WAS TO BUY A CAR FROM THE ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU SHAKE YOUR HEAD IF YOU DON'T KNOW
WELL OF COURSE NOT NOBODY KNOWS BECAUSE THE LATE NOBODY A SET OUT WHAT THINGS WOULD LOOK LIKE WHAT I'M SETTING OUT TODAY'S WHAT THE PROCESS WOULD BE THERE'S A TWO YEAR PROCESS IN WHICH WE WOULD RE NEGOTIATE A RELATIONSHIP OF THE THE
THE BASIS ON WHICH WE'D LEAVE THEN WE'D HAVE TO DO FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE COS I THAT WOULD CHANGE IMMEDIATELY
IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO CREATE JOBS WHO WHO DECIDE WHERE INVESTMENTS WILL GO THEY WOULD IMMEDIATELY KNOW THAT WE WERE GOING TO LEAVE AND THEY WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO FOLLOW AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES WHO EMPLOYED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WHO HAVE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT THESE JOBS INVESTMENTS ARE AT RISK AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO MAKE INSTEAD THE POSITIVE CASE BUT STAYING IN A REFORMED EUROPEAN UNION BUT IT'S QUITE HARD TO MAKE THAT CASE WHEN THERE'S NOBODY SAYING WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE O.K. BUT WHAT BUT YOU MIGHT YOU MIGHT BE MAKING THE POSITIVE CASE WAS STAYING IN BIGGER ALSO GOT THAT WOOD AND A LEMON BORIS JOHNSON THE TELEGRAPH RIGHTS GET HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE TALKING OF PROJECT FEAR YOUR SPELLING OUT THIS SORT OF DOOMSDAY SCENARIO FOR
FOUR HAVE THE OPTION OF BRITAIN VOTING TO LEAVE IN A REFERENDUM WHICH OF COURSE THE GOVERNMENT CALLED I MEAN YOU ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS AN OPTION THAT PEOPLE CAN VOTE LEAVE WIPE WHY CALL A REFERENDUM AND YET THERE'S THIS SORT OF DO THIS ARGUABLY SCAREMONGERING ALL ON THE CONTRARY I MEAN THIS IS A CAUTIOUS ASSESSMENT SOME LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SAY THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF SWITZERLAND
WELL THEIR NEGOTIATION FOR THEIR NEW ROUTE FOR THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. TOOK SIXTEEN YEARS THE GOVERNMENT ASSESSMENT IS THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT A BIT QUICKER THAN THAT AND YOU KNOW AND THEN WE COME TO ANOTHER CASE ON THAT'S RIGHT
NOBODY IN ANY OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGNS SEEMS TO COME BE ABLE TO TELL US WHETHER IF WE LEFT WE WOULD BE IN THE SINGLE MARKET OR IF WE WOULDN'T
IF WE'RE NOT IN THE SINGLE MARKET THAT WOULD BE A MASSIVE IMPACT AND IF WE ARE THEN WE'D STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE RULES OF THE SINGLE MARKET SO IT IS CATCH IT WHILE YOU UNDERSTAND HONEST I OUR SEPARATE ISSUE THEY WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHO IS CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE WOULD APPEAR TO NOT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS PAPERS
FROM HIS OWN DEPARTMENT BECAUSE HE IS CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE

WHAT THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE DOES IS IT INCREASES THE PACE AT WHICH WAGES WILL RISE AND THE BOY WHERE THAT'S NOT A BAD THING THAT'S IN MANY WAYS VERY GOOD THING BUT IT WILL ALSO PROBABLY ACCELERATE SOME OF THE CHANGES WITHIN THE WORKFORCE AND THE RESPONSES THAT RETAILERS MAKE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE RISING COST PRESSURE THAT THEY'RE SAYING

FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT WE KNOW FOR A LONG TIME THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH DOCTORS OR NURSES IN OUR HOSPITALS NOW THANKS TO A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST BY THE B. B. C. WE KNOW HOW SERIOUS THAT SHORTAGES IN SUMMARY THAT EAT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND ARE STRUGGLING TO FILL THE VACANCIES IN THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DO IT IS BY RECRUITING FROM ABROAD RITA BARKER HE'S A DOCTOR AT QUEEN'S HOSPITAL IN ROMFORD IN ESSEX SHE CAME HERE FROM ROMANIA
I COULD HAVE DONE A P.H.D. IN UNITED STATES OR I COULD HAVE WORKED AT HOME OBVIOUSLY I DON'T WANT WOULD HAVE STRUGGLED MORE WITH THE SALARY BUT OVERALL WHAT N.H.S. OFFERS BESIDES THIS CELERY I THINK
THE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT AND WE DO HAVE GOOD CONDITIONS
AND I WOULD SAY THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS QUITE COMPETITIVE AND I FEEL ESPECIALLY IN THE U.K. PROBABLY THE TOP OF THE CLASS SCENE MAY SEEN IN OTHER PROFESSIONS THE TOP OF THE CLASS I HOPE COMING HERE
WELL I'VE JUST BEEN TALKING TO THE INCOMINGS WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HEALTH EDUCATION ENGLAND AND TO MATTHEW HOPKINS CHIEF EXEC OF BARKING CABLING AND RED BRICK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL I ASKED HIM IF IT'S TRUE THERE ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH NURSES ARE NOT ENOUGH DOCTORS ADI'S OSPITAL
WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO FILL A VACANCY IS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO PROVIDE A SAFE CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS BUT WE DO OPERATE IN IT QUITE A COMPETITIVE MARKET WHERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOSPITALS ALSO SEEKING TO FISH FROM A LIMITED SUPPLY OF NURSES AND DOCTORS PARTICULARLY IN THE SPECIALTY OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE WHERE IT'S PARTICULARLY COMPETITIVE NATIONALLY BUT ALSO ACROSS LONDON WHAT EFFECT HAS THAT HAD
ON EMERGENCY SERVICES IN PARTICULAR ONE OF THE KEY EFFECTS IS BEING ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING GOOD TEAMS LEADING GOOD CARE AND MAKING SURE THE PATIENTS HAVE A GOOD QUALITY COUNTS THAT'S FIRST THING I THINK THE SECOND WAS GOING TO I IT IT WAS THE SECOND I MEAN ALL THE PATIENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THEY GET
THE RIGHT TO CARE WHEN THEY NEEDED I'LL BE GETTING IT YES THEY ARE BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND A FORMER NURSE THE PRIORITY IS PROVIDING AS GOOD AND HIGH QUALITY CARE AS POSSIBLE
AND WE HAVE TO SUPPLEMENT OUR STAFF WITH A TEMPORARY WORKERS WHO AGENCY WHAT AGENCY WORKERS EXACTLY WHO WHO ARE NOT PART OF THE TEAM ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEREFORE THAT THEY HAD THE CUT THE QUALITY TEAMWORK WHICH WE KNOW HAS THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON PATIENT CARE PATIENT SAFETY IS COMPROMISE AS A AS A CONSEQUENCE AND IT'S EXPENSIVE OF COURSE
YES THE AVERAGE PREMIUM FOR AGENCY STAFF IS AN UPLIFT OF TWENTY PER CENT COSTS TWENTY PER CENT MORE TO EMPLOY AN AGENCY NURSE RUN AN AGENCY DOCTOR AT HAVING SAID THAT THE THE NEWLY INTRODUCED CAPS ON AGENCY HOURLY RATES AS HELP TO REDUCE THE SPEND IN OUR ORGANISATION BY FIVE MILLION POUNDS THIS YEAR NONETHELESS ARE YOU HAVING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
SO MY ORGANISATIONS HAD FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES FOR SOME YEARS BUT ACTUALLY WE'RE IN A SMALL GROUP OF ORGANISATIONS CURRENTLY THAT CENTRE THEY WOULD HIT A YEAR END FINANCIAL TARGET AND HIS PLATT ON PLAN TO HIT THAT BUT IF THINGS CARRY ON LIKE THIS THE RECRUITMENT PROBLEMS THAT IS WHAT EFFECT IS IT GOING TO HAVE A HOSPITAL LIKE YOURS
SO ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS HOW DO WE RETAIN OUR EXISTING STAFF SO OURS STAFF SURVEY RESULTS FROM LAST YEAR SHOWING THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST MOTIVATED STAFF IN THE N.H.S. TOP TWENTY PER CENT OF THE COUNTRY WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO DO IS TO ENCOURAGE LOCAL PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS TRAVEL PAST OUR HOSPITALS INTO INNER LONDON TO TO WORK WITH THAT'S NURSING POSTS OR DOCTORS
TO ACTUALLY STAY LOCALLY BECAUSE WE CAN OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF BENEFITS ACTUALLY IN AN ORGANISATION THAT IS VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON IMPROVING PATIENT BUT IF NOTHING CHANGES IF THIS PROBLEM OF RECRUITING AND MAINTAINING RE CANING ENOUGH DOCTORS OR NURSES CARRIES ON WHAT EFFECT MIGHT IT HAVE ON A HOSPITAL LIKE
SO THE ABILITY TO TO TO STAY WITHIN BUDGET IS OBVIOUSLY A KEY ONE BUT MY FIRST AND FOREMOST PRIORITIES MAKE SURE THAT OUR PATIENTS GET REALLY GOOD QUALITY CARE AND I THINK THE DIFFICULTY WITH RUNNING A RELATIVELY HIGH VACANCY RATE WHILST THAT'S IMPROVED WITH WE STILL HAVE ELEVEN PERCENT OF OUR POST VACANT IT DOES INHIBIT THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE BEST CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS IN THE LONG RUN PATIENCE DO SUFFER AS A RESULT OF IT
I THINK THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE TO SAY THAT THE BEST OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS ARE DELIVERED BY A TEAM OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE WORKING CONSISTENTLY TOGETHER AND AND IF YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT THEN THE BENEFITS THE PATIENTS ARE MUCH BETTER
OR SO IN THE LONG RUN PATIENTS WILL SUFFER I THINK IN THAT IN THE LONG RUN UNLESS THERE IS A BETTER APPROACH TO WORKFORCE PLANNING AND THE THE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE OVERSEAS STAFF IS A KEY ONE BECAUSE THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED FOR US TO HAVING SUCH A HIGHLY MOTIVATED WORKFORCE FOR YOU'VE HAD TO BRING IN PEOPLE YOURSELF FROM OVERSEAS
YES THAT'S NOT A NEW ISSUE I MEAN I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A SHOP FLOOR NURSE IN THE NINETIES WE READILY RECRUITED FROM OVERSEAS IRELAND AUSTRALIA BUT I THINK THE SCALE OF THE THE THE OVERSEAS RECRUITMENT IS DIFFERENT WE'VE RECRUITED SOME FANTASTIC STAR FROM ITALY SPAIN AND PORTUGAL IN THE RECENT MONTHS AND THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING A LOT TO THE CARE OF PATIENTS THANKS FOR THAT LET ME TURN TO
IAN CUMMINGS WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HEALTH EDUCATION ENGLAND YOU RECOGNISED THIS PROBLEM WHAT DO YOU USE IT EVERY DAY MISTER CUMMINGS YES WE CERTAINLY DO RECOGNISE THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR SHORTAGE OF NURSES BUT ALSO SOME OF THE WORKFORCE WITHIN THE N.H.S. AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE
THE DEMAND FOR NURSES IN OUR HOSPITALS HAS GONE UP BY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OUR ORGANISATION IS INFORMED BY N.H.S. TRUSTS HOW MANY NURSES THEY INTEND TO EMPLOY AND SAY THAT FIGURE'S GONE BY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND IN RESPONSE TO MID STAFFORDSHIRE PREDOMINANTLY BUT ALSO SOME OF THE OTHER QUALITY FAILINGS THAT WE SAW IN THE SORRY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I DON'T GET THAT WHY WOULD THERE BE A SHORTAGE OF NURSES BECAUSE OF QUALITY FEELINGS AS HE PUT IT
THE QUALITY FAILINGS IN THE N.H.S. HAVE CAUSED OUR REGULATORS AND INDEED UP OUR HOSPITALS BUT BUT ACROSS THE N.H.S. TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT HOW MANY NURSES THEY NEED TO DELIVER SAFE AND HIGH QUALITY CARE IN OTHER WORDS WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH NURSES BEFORE IN ORDERED THAT'S A QUALITY SERVICE THAT'S CORRECT SO I'LL HOSPITALS ARE NOW FOR ROUGHLY THE SAME NUMBER OF PADS COMPARED TO ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THEY NOW HAVE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND OR NEED FOR TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND MORE QUALIFIED NURSES
AND THEY SIMPLY ARE NOT OUT THERE NOW IT TAKES ROUGHLY SPEAKING FOR YEARS TO TRAIN A NURSE SO IT'S A THREE YEAR DEGREE COURSE BUT OBVIOUSLY THE NURSE HAS TO BE RECRUITED ONTO THAT DEGREE COURSE THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY PROCESSES
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS HE'S INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY THE NUMBER OF TRAINING PLACES FOR NURSES BUT THEY WON'T START COMING THROUGH THE SYSTEM FOR ANOTHER ONE OR TWO YEARS SO WE'RE PREDICTING AT THE MOMENT THAT WILL HAVE SUPPLY AND DEMAND RIGHTFUL NURSES FOR THE N.H.S. BY ABOUT TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUT IT DOES LEAVE US WITH THE GAP BETWEEN NOW AND THEN
AND WHAT HAPPENS TO FILL THAT GAP WELL WHAT YOU'RE REPORTING BASICALLY WE'RE SEEING ORGANISATIONS GOING OVERSEAS ALTHOUGH I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS ISN'T A NEW PHENOMENON IN TWENTY IN TWO THOUSAND FOR TWO THOUSAND FIVE FOR EXAMPLE TWELVE AND A HALF THOUSAND NURSES JOINED THE N.H.S. FROM OVERSEAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOR FIVE THAT FIGURE WAS EIGHT THOUSAND THE NUMBER COMING IN FROM OVERSEAS HAS ACTUALLY GONE DOWN THAT OVERSEAS NURSES HAVE ALWAYS MADE A CONTRIBUTION TO OUR N.H.S. UP OR NOT AT THIS LEVEL
YES THEY ARE RATHER LEVEL HAS ACTUALLY COME DOWN SO IT WAS FOURTEEN AT TWELVE AND A HALF THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND FOR FIVE DOWN TO EIGHT THOUSAND THAT I WAS THE PEAK WAS THAT THE DUKE HAD RISEN TO THAT CLUB TWO THOUSAND THREE FOUR WAS ACTUALLY THE PEAK BUT IT'S COME DOWN FAIRLY STEADILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOR FIVE SIR NO IT WAS YES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IT HAS STARTED TO GO BACK UP AGAIN RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND IS IT PURELY THAT OR IS IT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE OR
IS IT THE EFFECT OF THAT ON WAGES AND THE COSTS THE HOSPITALS HAVE TO BEAR WE HAVE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WANTING TO TRAIN TO BE NURSES IN THIS COUNTRY SO ROUGHLY SPEAKING WE TAKE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE INTERNET'S TRAINING EVERY YEAR AND FOR THOSE TWENTY THOUSAND TRAINING PLACES WE HAVE SIXTY THOUSAND APPLICANTS SO THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WANTING TO TRAIN I THINK THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT THIS IS A GEOGRAPHICAL ISSUE SO THERE ARE SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY LONDON IN PARTICULAR SO ONE PART OF LONDON
WHERE THIS SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF FIFTEEN PERCENT VACANCY WHEREAS IF YOU GO OUT TO SOME OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY NORTH WEST SOUTH WEST IN PARTICULAR THE VACANCY RATE IS ABOUT THREE PER CENT SO IT'S VERY VARIABLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY
I'M STRUGGLING A BIT TO SEE WHERE THIS CRISIS IT IS UM IT IS IN A CRISIS WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF NURSES IN THE N.H.S. IN THE MOMENT TAKING UP SUBSTANTIVE POSTS BUT THAT HAS BEEN CAUSED PREDOMINANTLY BY AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED NURSING POSTS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR N.H.S.
MEANING WHAT MEANING THAT IN RESPONSE TO THE QUALITY CONCERNS THE N.H.S. HAS RECRUITED OR TRIED TO RECRUIT MORE QUALIFIED NURSES WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FILL ALL THOSE POSTS WE TRAIN TWENTY THOUSAND NURSES YEAR AND IF THE DEMAND GOES UP OVER AND ABOVE WHAT WE NORMALLY HAVE BY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND WE SIMPLY CAN'T FILL THOSE IN ONE OR TWO YEARS AND THE EFFECT ON PATIENTS WHICH IS IN THE END ALL THAT MATTERS IS GOING TO BE WHAT
FROM OUR FIGURES WE BELIEVE THAT ABOUT HALF OF THAT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR NURSES HAS BEEN FILLED WITH PEOPLE ON FULL TERM CONTRACTS THE REMAINDER IS BEING FILLED BY AGENCY STAFF BY TEMPORARY STUFF BY LOCAL STAFF AND BUY RECRUITMENT FROM OVERSEAS RIGHT SO I COME BACK TO THIS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THE EFFECT ON PATIENTS IS GOING TO BE WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO SUFFER AS A RESULT OF THIS OR IS THIS A VERY SHORT TERM PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED ONCE
OR ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW BEING TRAINED A TRAINED IS THERE A PROBLEM OR IS THERE NOT BY TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WE EXPECT THE SUPPLY OF NURSES IN ENGLAND TO MATCH THE DEMAND FOR NURSE'LL THEY'LL BE ENOUGH IN OTHER WORDS INVITE TWENTY WILL BE ENOUGH WHEN IS THE ROYAL B. BUT THAT CLEARLY IS THREE TO FOUR YEARS AWAY FROM NOW AND WE DO HAVE THE ISSUE OF HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT HIGH QUALITY SAFE HEALTH CARE IS DELIVERED OVER THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND DURING THAT TIME YOU'VE GOT A RECRUIT THEM FROM OVERSEAS
AMONGST USING AGENCY STAFF AND OTHER OTHERWISE YES RIGHT BUT WILL THE PATIENTS SUFFER AS A RESULT OF IT I HOPE NOT NO UM IN THE THE
THERE ARE MORE NURSES EMPLOYED IN OUR N.H.S. HOSPITALS NOW THAN THERE WERE TWO YEARS AGO SO THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT'S BEING DELIVERED NOW IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO WE ARE WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN TERMS OF SUBSTANTIVE STUFF BUT BUT AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD MOST OF THESE VACANCIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE BEING FILLED BY TEMPORARY STUFF THEREFORE THEY ARE DELIVERING CARE THE INCOMINGS AND MATTHEW HOPKINS THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH

IT IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES A NINE THERE IS NO LET UP SO FAR ANYWAY IN THE INTENSITY OF THE DEBATE OVER WHETHER WE SHOULD STAY IN THE E.U. OR GET OUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S A COMPLICATED BUSINESS BUT FOR THE IN CROWD YOU CALLED TRYING TO REDUCE THE ARGUMENTS JUST A FEW WORDS THAT OLD HILAIRE BELLOC BOGGLE ALWAYS KEEP A HOLD OF NURSE FOR FEAR OF FINDING SOMETHING WORSE OR EVEN JUST ONE WORD IF YOU WERE IN THE OTHER CAMP
UNCERTAINTY WELL I AM JOINED BY CHRIS GRAYLING WHO IS THE READ THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE CABINET MINISTERS WHO WANTS TO PULL OUT GOOD MORNING TO YOU HELLO BETH AND YOU'VE BEEN TALKING THIS MORNING ABOUT THE RELENTLESS CAMPAIGN OF SEER BEING WAGED BY THE IN CROWD FEAR THIS IS SLIGHTLY PUZZLING TO SOME PEOPLE ISN'T IT BECAUSE
WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO IF THEY BELIEVE LEAVE IT IS IN THE INTERESTS OF THIS NATION TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY SO WHY IS THAT A CAMPAIGN OF FEAR IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID OVER THE PAST WEEK LET ME GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES SO WE HAD A WEEK AGO EASYJET SAYING IT WOULD BE THE END OF LOW COST AIR TRAVEL
WELL THE TRUTH IS LOW COST AIR TRAVEL EMERGED FROM UNITED STATES IT WAS ABOUT AIRLINES CHANGING THE WAY THEY DO THINGS AND THERE ARE LOW COST AIRLINES ALL AROUND THE WORLD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN BRUSSELS CAMPAIGN OF BLOODY LIKEWISE THE THE SUGGESTION IT WILL TAKE US TEN YEARS TO EXTRICATE OURSELVES WITH EUROPEAN UNION TO DELIVER NEW TRADE DEALS WELL WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE THINK IT WOULD TAKE TWICE AS LONG AS THE SECOND WORLD WAR
TO BE ABLE TO SORT OUT OUR TRADING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE AND WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU HAVE TO USE THE SECOND WORLD WAR WAS TO PROVE YOUR POINT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS IT WOULD TAKE A VERY VERY LONG TIME INDEED TO SORT EVERYTHING OUT AND AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH THAT AGAIN IT'S HARDLY FEAR IF THAT IS WHAT THEY BELIEVED TO BE THE CASE THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SAY SO BUT WHAT POSSIBLE EVIDENCE IS THAT IT WILL TAKE US TEN YEARS TO SORT OUT TRADING ARRANGEMENTS WE LOOK WELL RELATIONS WITH EUROPEAN UNION
WE HAVE A FIFTY BILLION POUND PLUS A YEAR TRADE DEFICIT WITH EUROPEAN UNION WE HAVE BY FAR MORE FROM THEM THAN THEY BUY FROM US THE JOB'S AT RISK IF WE DO NOT QUITE RAPIDLY MOVED TO A NEW TRADING ARRANGEMENTS ARE IN BAVARIA AND IN FRANCE AND IN ITALY AND IN SPAIN AND THERE NOBODY SERIOUSLY THINKS THAT THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TURN ROUND TO ITS FARMERS WHO SELL PLENTY OF PRODUCE TO US AT THE MOMENT ARE GUYS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL THAT ANY MORE COS WE HAVEN'T REACHED A NEW TRADE DEAL THEY WOULD BE OUT ON THE FRENCH MOTORWAYS BLOCKADING THE MORROW ONLY WHALES TELL US WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO
WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THERE WITH EMBRYO PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION TO SORT OUT THEIR NEW RELATIONSHIP WE WILL HAVE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WILL SUCCEED IN THAT BECAUSE IT WILL BE RELATIVELY QUICK BECAUSE HASN'T IT THEIR FINANCIAL INTEREST TO DO THAT'S HOW QUICK IT WILL BE QUICK ENOUGH TO ENSURE THERE ISN'T A HIATUS IN TRADING BECAUSE THEY LOSE FINANCIALLY IF THE RITZ YOU KNOW THEY SELL FAR MORE TO US THAN THAT THEN WE SELL TO THEM
THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS THEIR BUSINESSES ARE IN DANGER IF WE SORT IT OUT QUICKLY DID THE GERMANS THEMSELVES OR SAID THEY'D MOVE QUICKLY TO HAVE A TRADE DEAL CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE CABINET OFFICE AS YOU KNOW HOW WELL PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT'S ONLY JUST BEEN RELEASED BUT I'M SURE THEY WILL ALLOW YOU TO SEE IT THEY SAY IT WOULD NOT BE FEASIBLE TO LEAVE WITHIN THE TWO YEAR TIME FRAME STIPULATED BY EXISTING TREATIES OR VOTE TO LEAVE THE Y. YOU WOULD BE THE START NOT TO THE END OF A PROCESS IT COULD LEAD TO UP TO A DECADE OR MORE
OF UNCERTAINTY SO THERE WE ARE YOU SEE AND THEN THE DECADE AND THAT'S MY POINT ABOUT WHY ON EARTH WOULD IT TAKE TWICE AS LONG AS THE ENTIRE ISLAND IT'S THEY SENSE THERE'S THE CAMP CUMBERLAND OFTEN CIVIL SERVANT SAYING THIS AND THEY'RE NOT PARTI PRIS OLLIE THE REALITY IS THAT WE BUY FAR MORE FROM EUROPEAN UNION THEY BUY FROM US YOU KNOW WITH A FRENCH WHILE WITH THE FRENCH OR GERMAN GOVERNMENTS WANTS TO PUT IN JEOPARDY THE TRADE THAT WOULD CARRY ON WHICH RIGHT NOW IS TO THERE
SERIOUS BUSINESS ADVANTAGE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RISK JOBS IN BAVARIA IN THE CAR INDUSTRY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RISK JOBS IN FRANCE IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO CARRY ON TRADING ARRANGEMENTS THERE'LL BE LITTLE CHANGED IN THE EARLY YOU LOOKED AT THE HISTORY OF TRADING ARRANGEMENTS ON HOW LONG THEY TAKE
OVER THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS HOW COMPLEX THESE THINGS ARE PEOPLE TEND TO MOVE PRETTY QUICKLY WHEN THEY THEMSELVES ARE GOING TO LOSE OUT FINANCIALLY AND THIS IS THE KEY POINT TEN SO YOU CAN'T PROVE ANY OF THIS CAN YOU I THAT WE COULD ARGUE THAT THIS IS THE THIS IS A CAMPAIGN OF FEAR AS WELL COULDN'T WE WHAT JOHN DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THAT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT IS GOING TO SAY TO FRENCH FARMERS WHO WE KNOW ARE PRETTY FEISTY BRANCH THAT WE HAVEN'T MANAGED TO CONCLUDE A TRADE TO HELP SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR PRODUCTS IN BRITAIN ANY MORE OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT
AND THESE ARE TRADING ARRANGEMENT WE ALREADY APPLY EUROPEAN UNION LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY SO ANY CHANGE WILL BE GRADUAL TO THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN THIS COUNTRY NOTHING DRAMATIC CHANGES THE DAY AFTER INDEED STUART ROSE WHO'S HEADING THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS SAID NOTHING VERY MUCH WILL CHANGE IN THE SHORT TERM ARE YOU THAT'S RIGHT IT IS OVER TIME THAT WE GAIN ADDITIONAL FREEDOMS TO FORGE NEW TRADE DEALS WITH THE COMMONWEALTH FOR EXAMPLE BUT THERE IS NO WAY THAT COUNTRIES ON CONTINENTAL EUROPE
WHO BENEFIT ENORMOUSLY IN JOBS IN BUSINESS FROM US FROM SELLING PRODUCTS TO ASK TO PUT THAT BUSINESS IN DANGER HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE CERTAIN CABINET PAPERS I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WHILE WE HAVE THIS DEBATE GOVERNMENTS CAN CARRY ON WORKING AS NORMAL THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO NOTHING THAT HAPPENS
CAN PREVENT HIM MINISTER RUNNING A DEPARTMENT WHETHER ON THE SIDES TO COOK COMPANY TO STAY IN OR CAMPAIGN STAY OUT FROM BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB FOR THIS COUNTRY AND FOR THIS GOVERNMENT AND OF COURSE BUSINESS IN EUROPE CONTINUES AS WELL BECAUSE WE ARE STILL RIGHT NOW MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND THEREFORE MINISTERIAL COLLEAGUES NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT IN ORDER TO REPRESENT RIGHT AND SO YOU HAD FOR CIVIL SERVANTS TO SHOW THE PAPERS THE PARROT THAT THEN BEING TOLD THEY SHOULDN'T SHOW YOU ONE PROBABLY NOT EXPECTING ADVANCE NOTICE OF THE DOSSIER WAS PUB YOU TAKE MY POINT BUT I THINK YES OF COURSE IF THERE IS AN IMPORTANT EUROPEAN MEETING COMING UP THE SUBSTANCE THAT MEETING NEEDS TO BE ACROSS THE DESK OF EVERY MINISTER INVOLVED CHRIS GRAYLING THANKS A LOT

COFFEE THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE POOR LEO THAT'S BEEN A FORM OF RUNNING GAG ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE DESPITE BEING NOMINATED SIX TIMES LEONARDO DI CAPRIO HAS NEVER WON AN OSCAR THAT CHANGED LAST NIGHT WHEN HE FINALLY WALKED OFF WITH BEST ACTOR FOR THE RAVEN AND THE BRITISH WINNERS INCLUDED MARK RYLANCE WHO WON BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR AND SAM SMITH WHO WON BEST ORIGINAL SONG FOR HIS BOND THEMES THE SPECTRE FROM LOS ANGELES DAVID WILLIS REPORTS
THERE'S NO ESCAPING THE PROTESTERS HOLLYWOOD'S BIGGEST STARS MADE THEIR WAY TO THE VEGETABLE AND LUCIEN I HOPE THE CEREMONY GOT UNDER WAY THAN THE SHOW'S HOST WAS CONFRONTING THE CONTROVERSY HEAD ON
CANON ELISE FIFTEEN BLACK PEOPLE ON THAT MUD
CHRIS ROCK HIMSELF AN AFRICAN AMERICAN TURN THE ISSUE OF RACIAL DIVERSITY INTO THE THEME OF THE NIGHT HE SPREAD HIS BARBS EVENLY AT ONE POINT POKING FUN AT THE BLACK CELEBRITIES WHO'D LEAD CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT OF THE AWARDS AND EVEN SOUGHT TO INJECT AN ELEMENT OF CONTEXT INTO THE DEBATE
IN THE SIXTIES WHEN I WAS HERE SAID THEY'D PUT OUT A MOVIE
I'M SURE THEY WOULD NOT LET NOMINEES SOMEONE AND BLACK PEOPLE DIDN'T PROTEST
DO YOU THINK THEY'VE BEEN LITTLE LAME JUST TO CARE ABOUT WHO WON A CINNAMON
FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW NOT ONLY WERE ALL THE ACTORS NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR WHITE BUT WHERE A FILM WITH BLACK ACTORS GARNERED NOMINATIONS ALL OF THOSE NOMINEES WERE WHITE AS WELL HOLLYWOOD CHRIS ROCK CONCLUDED HIS RACIST BUT IT'S CHANGING WE WHY ARE PARTICULARLY WHAT THE BLACK ACTORS TODAY
THE OSCAR GOES TO CLAIRE MAD MAX THE POST APOCALYPTIC ACTION FILM MAD MAX FURY ROAD WAS THE MOST AWARDED FILM OF THE NIGHT PICKING UP SIX TECHNICAL AWARDS WAS BRITAIN'S MARK RYLANCE WAS NAMED BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR FOR HIS ROLE IN BRIDGE OF SPIES
BUT SETTEE OF A DIFFERENT KIND CAME UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT WHEN SAM SMITH'S DOUBLE O. SEVEN THEME TUNE WAS NAMED BEST ORIGINAL SONG
I READ AN ARTICLE A FEW MONTHS AGO BY SIR IAN MCKELLEN AND HE SAID THAT NO OPENLY GAY MAN HAD EVER WON AN OSCAR I WANT TO DEDICATE THIS TO THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY ALL AROUND THERE
GOES TO THE REVENUE TO THE STORY OF A NINETEENTH CENTURY FUR TRAPPER LOST IN A FROZEN WILDERNESS AND ITS DIRECTOR ONE HUNDRED MEMORY TO HIS SECOND ACADEMY AWARD IN SUCCESSIVE YEARS THE FILM STAR LEONARDO DI CAPRIO PICKED UP THE BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS CAREER OSCAR GO STREWN SPUD
WHY IT'S THE STORY OF THE BOSTON GLOBES INVESTIGATION INTO THE SEX ABUSE SCANDAL IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PICKED UP THE BIG AWARD OF THE NIGHT THAT FOR BEST FILM BUT THIS ACADEMY AWARDS WILL BE REMEMBERED LESS FOR THE QUALITY OF THE FILMS AND IT WILL FOR THE ROW OVER THE PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR THEM
DAVID WILLIS REPORTING AND WE'RE JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY NISH KUMAR WHO IS A STAND UP COMEDIAN WHO SAYS THAT WATCH THE AWARDS EVERY YEAR GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HOW'S IT GOING WITH YOU COS YOU HAVE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT WAS IT WORTH IT IT WAS THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE BEST CEREMONY I CAN THINK OF IT PASSED REALLY QUICKLY NORMALLY REALLY DRAGS ALTHOUGH
GOING HOME FROM MY FRIEND'S HOUSE AND WATCHING PEOPLE GETTING READY TO GO TO WORK IT DOES MAKE YOU REALISE YOU DON'T HAVE A REAL JOB WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT AND WATCH MILLIONAIRES DISTRIBUTE GOLD STATUES TO EACH OTHER FOR PLAYING DRESS UP WHEN WE SPOKE TO MARK RYLANCE AT TEN PAST EIGHT THIS MORNING OF COURSE WON BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR GONE HE SAID THAT ACTUALLY PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT
WENT TO CHRIS ROCK THE COMPERE BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOU HANDLED THE AWARDS GIVEN ALL THE ROW COS HE WAS VERY VERY DIFFICULT GIG TO SORT OF TO GO TO GIVEN WHAT'S A BOT'S BEEN SET YEAH I MEAN THE ANTICIPATION WAS INTENSE EYE THERE WAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON HIM TO DELIVER AND I THOUGHT I THOUGHT WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE I MEAN HE IS ONE OF MY HEROES ONE OF THE REASONS I STARTED DOING STAND UP AND WHAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY YESTERDAY WAS REALLY BEING REMINDED OF THE VISCERAL THRILL OF WATCHING HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE IT REALLY FELT LIKE HE
ATTACK THE OPPORTUNITY WITH RELISH HE REALLY GOT STRAIGHT INTO IT AND REALLY ATTACKED THE ISSUE OF DIVERSITY IN THE OSCARS I THINK HE'S OPENING SENTENCE HAD SOMETHING LIKE HOLLYWOOD IS RACES AS HE WALKED OUT HE WAS MADE REFERENCE TO THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTORS IN THE OPENING MONTAGE BUT IT I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LONG SORT OF CEREMONY ISN'T IT THIS IS OURS ALONG THIS CEREMONY YET THE WHOLE THING IS A REAL FEATS OF ENDURANCE IT'S BUT
HE HE KEPT HIS ENERGY GOING THROUGH THE HOLE THROUGH THE WHOLE THING I THINK THE OPENING MONOLOGUE WAS THE KEY IT'S TOWN SETTER FOR THE ENTIRE AFFAIR AND THEY CAME OUT AND SORT OF VERY QUICKLY ESTABLISHED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO BE DODGING THE ISSUE OH KAY AS HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU OBVIOUSLY HE'S
PRESENTATION OF THE WHOLE THING ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD POINT TO MARK RYLANCE OR SPEECH WAS ONE OF THE CLASSIEST THINGS IMAGINABLE AT QUITE A SELF CONGRATULATORY AFFAIR HE SORT OF MANAGED TO STRIKE A TOWN BETWEEN LOOKING GENUINELY HUMBLE BUT ALSO LOOKING
QUITE THANKFUL THAT HE'D WON AN OSCAR HE WAS A REAL CLASS ACT HE WAS BEST SPEECH FOR ME ABSOLUTELY AND AT THE OTHER END OF THIS SCALE NORMALLY WE HAVE SOMEBODY WEEPING AND SORT OF RATHER EMBARRASSINGLY WE HAVE THAT NOW THERE WAS NO REAL OPEN TEARS I THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FROM LEONARDO DE KAPPA IF HE HADN'T ONE I THINK THIS DECAMP HERE HADN'T WON THE OSCAR HE WOULD HAVE RUGBY TACKLED WHOEVER DID AND JUST KEPT IT FOR HIMSELF
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY THE ONLINE RESPONSE BUT I DO SOME OF THE ART THEY WERE IN THIS MORNING IS THAT HE BROKE ALL THE REACTION TO HIM WINNING WAS A BREAKING THE INTERNET YEAH THAT'S RIGHT EXACTLY PEOPLE SEEM TO BE REALLY INVESTED IN HIM WINNING AND ASK PEOPLE SEEM TO BE REALLY INVESTED IN ALREADY INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL BAND BECOMING MORE SUCCESSFUL WHICH IS REALLY TESTAMENT TO HIS CHARISMA I THINK DID HE REFERENCE IT WHEN HE GOT HE DIDN'T REFERENCE OVERTLY BUT THERE WAS A LOOK IN HIS EYES THAT SEEM TO SAY
YEAH UP AND WAITING FOR THIS OH SO THAT DESPITE ALL THE ADVANCED SORT OF FOR RAW ABOUT IT YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD BE THAT ACTUALLY IS ONE OF THE BEST ONE SO FAR YEAH I THOUGHT I THOUGHT CHRIS WAS INCREDIBLE I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY REALLY GREAT YOU HAVE TO THINK TO CONTEXTUALISE ALL OF THIS STUFF AND SORT OF SAY IT'S A BIT LIKE BEYONCE THE SUPERBOWL THAT IT'S VERY RARE TO SEE SOMEBODY MAKE SUCH A POLITICISED STATEMENT IN THIS SORT OF CONTEXT THIS IS THE OSCARS IS THE SEAT OF HOLLYWOOD POWER WATCHING SOMEBODY
THAT SUBVERSIVE THING WAS REALLY FASCINATING TO USE IT THIS KIMA THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT IS NOW TEN TO NINE AND THERE'S A NEW EXHIBITION OPENING IN LONDON THE SERPENTINE THEY HAVE THE WORK OF
CLINT AND NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEAT YOURSELF UP IF YOU HAVE NEVER
HEARD OF THAT IS PARTLY THE POINT OF THE EXHIBITION SHE PAINTED UP STRANKS SHE DIED IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR BUT IT WAS MORE THAN FORTY YEARS BEFORE ANYONE ACTUALLY SAW ANY OF HER PAINTINGS NOW SHE'S RECOGNISED AS
ONE OF THE FIRST IF NOT THE FIRST ABSTRACT ARTISTS I'M JOINED BY JENNIFER HIGGY WHO WAS THE CO EDITOR OF THE LONDON BASED CONTEMPORARY ARTS MAGAZINE FRIEZE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOW
FIRST OF ALL THAT WAS SHE THE FIRST WILL COME TO THE FASCINATING TOPIC OF WITH A QUESTION WHY SHE DIDN'T EXHIBIT HER WORKS AND ALL THAT BUT BUT IT WAS KANDINSKY WASN'T HE WELL KANDINSKY'S RECOGNISES ONE OF THE FIRST WESTERN ABSTRACT PAINTERS COS WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ABSTRACT PAINTING HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN NON WESTERN CONTEXT BUT KANDINSKY DID MAKE WORK AROUND NINETEEN TEN BUT HE'LL MORE F. CLINT WAS MAKING EXTRAORDINARY ABSTRACT WORK AROUND NINETEEN HUNDRED AND SIX BUT THE DIFFERENCE WAS WELL THERE ARE MANY
MANY REASONS FOR THIS BUT HE'LL MESS CLINT WAS A WOMAN WHO ALSO CHOSE TO DO HER WORK IN PRIVATE WHERE'S KANDINSKY WAS VERY GOOD AT SELF PROMOTION IN THE WAY THEY HAVE MANY MEN WHO WERE MAKING MEDICAL ARK AT THAT TIME WERE AT ALL ARTISTS PRESUMABLY THERE'S A BIG STATE THAT ALL ARTISTS WANT THEIR WORK TO BE SEEN OTHERWISE
THEY WOULDN'T DO IT WELL HE'LL MOVE CLINT IS IN IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY INTERESTING AND PERHAPS UNIQUE CASE IN THE SENSE THAT SHE WAS MAKING CONVENTIONAL WORK THAT WAS AROUND BOTANICAL DRAWINGS PORTRAITS AND SHE WAS EXHIBITING THESE BUT THE MARKET SHE'S KNOWN FOR NOW THE ABSTRACT WORK
SHE WAS MAKING IN PRIVATE WITH A GROUP OF WOMEN CALLED THE FIVE HE MET EVERY FRIDAY TO TALK TO THEIR SPIRIT GUIDES AND SO THE INITIAL WORK WAS MADE UNDER THAT HER SPIRIT GUIDE WHO WAS CALLED A MALL YELL WHO WHO IN A SENSE COMMISSIONED HER TO MAKE THESE PAINTINGS AND FOR WHATEVER REASONS I MEAN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW NOW EVEN IF SHE JUST WANTED TO CONCENTRATE ON THIS WORK IN PRIVATE SO THAT SHE WOULDN'T BE DISTRACTED BY
DIFFICULT QUESTIONS OR SHE FELT REPRESSED AS A WOMAN AND DIDN'T FEEL THAT SHE COULD EXPRESS IT AS A WOMAN THERE WERE THAT MANY WORLD THERE WAS NO WIN AN ABSTRACT ARTISTS AT THE TIME WELL WAS THEY WORK THERE WERE SOME REALLY EXTRAORDINARY ABSTRACT PAINTERS THERE WAS IN LONDON THERE WAS GEORGIANA HORTON WHO WAS MAKING THE ACTUALLY EXHIBITED HER OWN ABSTRACT PAINTINGS IN THE EIGHTEEN SIXTIES ON BOND STREET HE WENT TO THE GALLERY I MEAN SHE GOT A LOT TO DRINK BUT I'M BEHIND TIME SHE DID DO IT SO SHE WAS DOING A SIMILAR THING TO WHOM THEY'VE CLAMPED THAT THING ABOUT DERISION
IF MAYBE I SUPPOSE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CLINT WAS WORRIED ABOUT HOW THE NAZIS WOULD WRECKERS THERE WERE A LOT OF NAZIS WEREN'T THERE IN SWEEPING OUT THAT TO OUR HOME IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR WHEN RIGHT WELL I MEAN THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE REASONS IT OR BECAUSE SHE DID STIPULATE IN HER WILL THAT HER WORK COULDN'T BE SHINE
OR LOOKED AT FOR TWENTY YEARS AFTER SPICES NINETEEN FORTY FOUR AND THAT WAS THE REASON THAT HER WORK WAS HIDDEN AWAY ALSO SHE SHE STIPULATED THAT HER WORK COULDN'T BE SOLD SO THERE WAS NO MARKET ACTION AROUND HER WORK WHICH IS ONE OF THE RECENT SHE DIDN'T BECOME FAMOUS HAMMER AGAIN HOW UNUSUAL YEAH I MEAN SHE SHE THERE WERE MANY REASONS THAT SHE SAID THAT THAT SHE COULD HAVE SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT HER WORK TO BE SEEN
AND ONE OF THEM IS PURE AND IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY FOUR THERE WAS ALTHOUGH SWEDEN WAS NEUTRAL AT WHAT THEY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN INVADED HER WORK WOULD HAVE BEEN DECLARED TO GENERATE BY THE NAZIS DESTROYED SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN A WAY OF HER SIMPLY PROTECTING HER WORK AND TRIED TO GIVE US ITS RADIO SQUIT WE COULD STICK A FICKLE BUT TRY TO GIVE US AN IDEA OF A CLASSIC CLINT AS IT WERE WELL
IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ART IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT SPIRITUALISM IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED AND ABSTRACTION ISOLATE FIGHT NOT TO LOVE THESE PAINTINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTRAORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL THINGS WHAT IT WHATEVER THEIR MEANING THEY'RE ENORMOUS THEY'RE THEY'RE DELIRIOUS THERE
PROBABLY TWO METERS TALL A LOT OF THEM I MEAN SHE WHAT SHE DID AT HER DEAD SHE HAD OVER TWELVE HUNDRED PAINTINGS SOME SMALL SOME BIG BUT THIS SERIES IT'S BEEN SHOWN AT THE SERPENTINE IS IN ENORMOUS DELIRIOUS COLOURFUL JOYFUL ABSTRACT SERIES OF PAINTINGS AND THEY ARE THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL THE FIRST TIME I SAW THEM IN THE MID END EATIN STUCK ON IN TWENTY THIRTEEN I WAS I WAS FELL OVER I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO BEAUTIFUL
WELL YOU'VE CERTAINLY BROUGHT IT ALIVE GENERAL HIGGY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANKS FOR HAVING ME IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES TO NINE
BRITISH PEOPLE POST SELFIES TRILLIONTH POST FOR TEETH THAT'S PHOTOS OF THEIR FEET IN CHINA SOCIAL MEDIA IS A DISTRACTION AND
IN BRAZIL IT'S A VALUABLE LEARNING AID DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES IT SEEMS USE SOCIAL MEDIA IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE OF NEW RESEARCH CALLED WHY WE POST IT'S A GLOBAL SOCIAL MEDIA RESEARCH PROJECT CARRIED OUT NOT LEAST BY TWO ANTHROPOLOGIST WHO HAVE JOINED ME HERE IN THE STUDIO DANIEL MILLER IS PROFESSOR AROUND APOLOGY AT U.C.L. YOU LED THE PROJECT AND SPECIFICALLY LOOKED AT ENGLISHNESS ELISABETTA COSTA IS AN ANTHROPOLOGIST AT THE BRITISH INSTITUTE OF ANKARA
WHO LOOKED AT HIM BUT HIS FOCUS MORE ON TURKEY IN THE MIDDLE EAST GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH THE Y. PROFESSOR MEN WHY FOCUS ON THIS PARTICULAR THING WHAT WAS THE INTEREST FOR YOU IT'S PARTLY THAT YOU PAY UP IN THEIR STATEMENTS ABOUT TWISS WHO IS HAVING THIS IMPACT ON POLITICS
OR FACEBOOK IS CHANGING THE NATURE OF FRIENDSHIP IS THAT THE POLITICS WE LISTEN TO THESE STATEMENTS AND WE THINK WELL WHO ACTUALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THIS GOING TO BE EQUALLY TRUE BRAZILIAN BILL WOOD OR AN I.T. PROFESSIONAL IN INDIA SO WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT ANTHROPOLOGIST GOING TO ENTER THE FLAME WE SIMULTANEOUSLY SET UP THESE NINE TALK EVERYBODY WAS FIFTEEN MONTHS IN EACH OF THEIR FIELD SITE AND ON THE BASIS OF THAT WE COULDN'T MAKE THE COMPARISON
ARE ACTUALLY SOCIAL MEDIA MAKINGS OF HOMOGENEITY OR POSTING THE SAME KIND OF SOPHIE OR IN FACT A USE EXPRESSIVE OF THE CULTURAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT SITES AND THE ANSWER TO THAT VERY CLEARLY IT WOULD SEEM IS THERE'S A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE INDEED I MEAN IF HE JUST FOR EXAMPLE COMPARED ARTIC SITES I WASN'T NECESSARILY EXPECTING THAT THERE WAS AN ENGLISH WAY OF DOING SOCIAL MEDIA COS WE JUST THINK WHAT WE DID WAS NATURAL
BUT WHAT I DISCOVERED IS THAT INCREASINGLY ADULTS IN ENGLAND HER CREATING WHAT I CALL THIS KIND OF GOLDILOCKS DRAMATICALLY WE WE LIKE TO KEEP A SOCIAL RELATIONS SORT OF NOT TOO WARM BUT NOT TOO COLD SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR COUSIN'S ON FACEBOOK THEY'RE THERE BUT THAT MEANS YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE A LONG CONVERSATION WITH THEM YOU SORT OF LOOK AT PEOPLE THROUGH THE NET CURTAINS OF YOUR SCREENS WHICH MEANS YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE THEM
INSIDE YOUR HOUSE AND I THINK THERE IS A VERY STRONG ENGLISH ELEMENTS IN THE WAY WE PROTECT PRIVACY BUT IF WE THEN COMPARE THAT TO SOUTH EAST TURKEY A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION WHICH IS WHAT PROFESSOR GOTHAM DISTILLATIONS HOW DO YOU START IS QUITE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY'RE PEOPLE YOU WAS THAT EVEN OFFAL VERY PUBLIC A FORM OF COMMUNICATION
AND THEY'RE NOT A PUBLIC FACING SUCH A MEDIA SUCH AS FACEBOOK FOR EXAMPLE ARE CONSTANTLY UNDER THE GAZE OF LET HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS AND SO PEOPLE CONFORM TO THE NEW INFORMATION ON SUCH A VALUE FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE BOSS VERY FEW EVEN MADGE'S OFFER FRIENDSHIP AND HE MAGEE SPLUTTERING RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THESE CAN CREATE AND CAUSE GOSSIP AND THEY'VE BEFORE THE BOSS GCS OF FOOD FOR EXAMPLE OR MADGE'S OFFER IF YOU'VE GOT POTTERY
BY CONTRAST THEM JADDO HEN SUCH A MEDIA HAVE OPEN UP NEW PRIVATE TRIANGLE OF COMMUNICATIONS WHERE THEIR YOUNG WE MEN ARE YOUNG MEN KEN DOG INTO IRAQ AND THE CAN EXPERIENCE
OH SEE THEM FOR A LOT OF SOCIETY THAT IS QUITE GENDER THING AGAINST IT OH KAY SO I MEAN IT SOUNDS IN ONE SENSE THE WAY THAT THEY USED IS MUCH MORE FORMAL BUT IT'S MUCH SAFER
IT'S OUT IN THEIR PUBLIC FACING SUCH A MEAT BUT IT'S LESS FOR A MALE IN THE PRIVATE SPACES OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA PHIL FOR EXAMPLE YOUNG PEOPLE
SEND UP FIVE BANDITS SIX STANDARD WHAT'S UP MESSAGES EVERY DAY TO THE SWEETHEART OF THE AND ENDED WITH SECRETLY FUNDED GAZE OFF MELODIES AND VIOLENCE OH KAY BUT NOW IN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BRETT PROFESSOR MILLER ABOUT WHETHER SOCIAL MEDIA IS RUINING SOCIAL INTERACTION WHAT WAS YOUR CONCLUSION
ACTUALLY WE THINK THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IN MANY AREAS IS REPAIRING THE DAMAGE IT IS BEING DONE TO SOCIAL RELATIONS BY OTHER CHANGES I MEAN IF WE THINK OF MIGRATION IN THE CHANGES IN THE JOB MARKET EXCEPT WE SEE THAT FAMILIES ARE FORCED APART AND ACTUALLY SOCIAL MEDIA IS OFF ITS SOCIAL MEDIA SO ACTUALLY IT OFTEN BRINGS PEOPLE BACK TO REPAIR THE FAMILY CAN BE TOGETHER AGAIN IN THIS TURKIC SITUATION YOU MIGHT HAVE TRIBES
AND WHO HAVE BEEN DISPERSED BUT NOW THANKS TO SOCIAL MEDIA THEY COME BACK I DID A PROJECT WITH PREVIOUSLY ACTUALLY WITH FILIPINOS WORKING HERE IN DOMESTIC LABOUR AND THEY HAVE TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR CHILDREN BACK IN THE PHILIPPINES AS THEY CAN SO THEY CAN BE USED TO DO THIS BUT THAT RATHER IN THE SILICON TO GILLIAN'S TAKE PICTURE OF THEIR FEET AND ENGLISH PEOPLE TAPE SELFIES PICTURES OF THEIR FACES IN TILL WE KNOW WHAT EITHER
YES I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THAT WE JUST HAD THIS WORD SOPHIE SOUNDS A BIT LIKE SELFISH PEOPLE SAY OH IT'S THE NARCISSISTIC TEENAGERS SECTOR BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY INVESTIGATING IT EVEN IF YOU LOOKED AT OUR TEENAGERS HERE IN THIS COUNTRY YOU FIND THAT ACTUALLY YES THERE'S THE GLAMOROUS L.P. THAT GOES INSTAGRAM I FACEBOOK THIS MAY BE WHAT WE CALL GROUP IS ACTUALLY AND THEY THEY SHOW FRIENDSHIP ON SNAP SHAT
THERE'S ACTUALLY THE UGLY THE REALLY HORRIBLE THING TO CARE FOR AT WHICH POINT WE'LL LEAVE PROFESSOR DANIEL MILLER ELISABETTA COSTA THANK YOU GOOD MORNING
